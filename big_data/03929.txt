ON THE CONNECTEDNESS OF THE STANDARD WEB OF

CALABI-YAU 3-FOLDS AND SMALL TRANSITIONS

SZ-SHENG WANG

ABSTRACT. We supply a detailed proof of the result by P.S. Green and
T. H ¨ubsch that all complete intersection Calabi–Yau 3-folds in product of
projective spaces are connected through projective conifold transitions
(known as the standard web). We also introduce a subclass of small
transitions which we call primitive small transitions and study such sub-

of Calabi–Yau 3-fold X, we show that if the natural closed immersion

Def(bX) ֒→ Def(X) is an isomorphism then X has only ODPs as singular-

ities.

1. INTRODUCTION

Calabi–Yau conifolds, i.e., Calabi–Yau 3-folds with only ordinary dou-
ble points (ODPs), arise naturally in algebraic geometry and string the-
ory, where a Calabi–Yau 3-fold X is a projective Gorenstein 3-fold with at
worst terminal singularities such that KX ∼ 0 and H1(OX) = 0. For ex-
ample, every Calabi–Yau 3-fold can be deformed to a smooth one or to a
conifold [6, 19]. M. Reid [23] had proposed to study the moduli spaces of
simply connected smooth Calabi–Yau 3-folds through conifold transitions,
by which we mean there is a small projective contraction from a smooth
Calabi–Yau to a Calabi–Yau conifold so that the conifold is smoothable.
This is usually referred as the Reid’s fantasy. While non-projective conifold
transitions are also considered in the literature, in this paper we stick on
the projective ones.

In 1988, P.S. Green and T. H ¨ubsch [8] discovered the remarkable connect-
edness phenomenon: The moduli spaces of complete intersection Calabi–Yau
3-folds (CICYs) in product of projective spaces are connected with each other by
a sequence of conifold transitions. In [8, §3 p.435], the authors deferred the
proof of the existence of conifold transitions to a forthcoming paper, which
unfortunately has not yet been available. This result had since then been
used again and again in the literatures on Calabi–Yau geometry and string
theory. While there is no doubt on its signiﬁcance and correctness, a de-
tailed complete proof to it is still long awaited. The ﬁrst goal of this paper
is to supply such a rigorous proof:

Theorem 1.1 (= Theorem 5.9). Any two (parameter spaces of) complete inter-
section Calabi–Yau 3-folds in product of projective spaces are connected by a ﬁnite
sequence of conifold transitions.

In order to connect these parameter spaces of CICY 3-folds, the major

idea is to use the determinantal contractions introduced in [1].

Let us recall a standard example to explain the process. Consider the
j (z)t0 + p1
smooth CICY 3-fold X in P1 × P4 deﬁned by p0
j (z)t1 = 0 for j =
1(z), p1
1, 2, where t0, t1 are homogeneous coordinates on P1, p0
1(z) are two
general quartic polynomials and p0
2(z) are two linear polynomials on
P4. Since ti’s can not both vanish, it must be the case that the determinant

2(z), p1

∆(z) := det(pi

j(z))

resulting from the projection along P1 vanishes (cf. Section 4). If we take
pi
2(z) = zi for i = 0, 1 and suitable quartic polynomials p0
1(z), then
the quintic X deﬁned by ∆(z) has 16 ODPs, where pi
j(z)’s vanish simulta-

1(z), p1

Note that all quntics in P4 are deformation equivalent inside a ﬂat family

neously, along a projective plane in P4. Let eX be a smooth quntic in P4.
(cf. Proposition 3.2). Thus we get a conifold transition bX → X   eX which
connects parameter spaces of bX and X.

In general, the task is to verify that the determinantal contraction is a
small resolution of a Calabi–Yau conifold. There is a well known criterion
(involved topological constraints) for ODPs.

Proposition 1.2 (= Proposition 2.3). Let bX → X be a small resolution of a
Gorenstein terminal 3-fold X and eX a smoothing of X. Then the difference of
the topological Euler numbers e(bX) − e(eX) equals the number 2 |Sing(X)| if and

only if the singularities of X are ODPs.

For conﬁgurations of 3-dimensional complete intersection varieties in a
product of a projective space and a smooth projective variety, we give the
formulas of the difference of the Euler numbers and the number of singu-
larities involving Chern classes of vector bundles (cf. Proposition 3.4 and
Corollary 4.4)

Another ingredient is a Bertini-type theorem for vector bundles (cf. Theo-
rem 2.1). The necessity for such a result with weaker positivity assump-
tions comes from the fact that the CICY 3-folds under consideration are
not always cut out by ample divisors. Combining with the original ideas
in [1, 8], we prove that the singular Calabi–Yau X deﬁned by the determi-
nantal equatioin (and other equatioins) has isolated singularities and the
determinantal contraction is a small resolution of X (cf. Theorem 4.2). Ac-
cording to Proposition 1.2, it follows that the determinantal contraction is
a small resolution of a Calabi–Yau conifold as expected. We also give a
formula of the second Betti number of CICYs (cf. Proposition 5.6).

In the ﬁnal section, we discuss how to relate small transitions to conifold
transitions. We introduce the primitive small transitions (cf. Deﬁnition 6.2)
and prove the following result:

Kuranishi spaces is an isomorphism then the singularities of X are ODPs. More-

of a Calabi–Yau 3-fold X. If the natural closed immersion Def(bX) ֒→ Def(X) of

2. PRELIMINARIES

Let σ : E → F be a morphism of vector bundles of ranks m and n on a
variety M. Note that there is a bijection between morphisms E → F and
global sections of E ∨ ⊗ F .

For k 6 min(m, n), we deﬁne the k-th degeneracy locus of σ by

Dk(σ) = {x ∈ M | rank(σx) 6 k}.

Its ideal is locally generated by (k + 1)-minors of a matrix for σ. We can
show that the codimension of Dk(σ) in M is less than or equal to (m −
k)(n − k) [22, (2.7)], which is called its expected codimension. Notice that
the 0-th degeneracy locus of σ is the zero scheme Z(σ).

Now we state a Bertini-type theorem for vector bundles. The following

statement is taken from [22, (2.8)].

Theorem 2.1. [22] Let E and F be vector bundles of ranks m and n on a smooth
variety M and let E ∨ ⊗ F be generated by global sections. If σ : E → F is a
general morphism, then one of the following holds:

(1) Dk(σ) is empty;
(2) Dk(σ) has expected codimension (m − k)(n − k) and the singular locus

of Dk(σ) is Dk−1(σ).

Here the ”general” means that there is a Zariski open set in the vector
space H0(E ∨ ⊗ F ) such that every global section σ in the open set satisﬁes
(1) or (2).

4

S.-S. WANG

Remark 2.2. Let D be a Cartier divisor on M. Assume that the linear sys-
tem Λ := |O(D)| is base point free. Since the (−1)-th degeneracy locus
is empty, the classical Bertini’s second theorem follows from Theorem 2.1
by taking k = 0, E = O and F = O(D). Namely, a general member of
Λ is smooth. We also know, by the Bertini’s ﬁrst theorem, that if Λ is not
composed of a pencil then its general member is irreducible. However, the
general degeneracy locus Dk(σ) may not be connected.

A birational morphism is called small if the exceptional set has codimen-
sion at least two. The following is a simple criterion of ODPs for a small

resolution bX → X if X admits a smoothing.
Proposition 2.3. Let bX → X be a small resolution of a Gorenstein terminal 3-fold
X and eX a smoothing of X. Then the difference of the topological Euler numbers
e(bX) − e(eX) equals the number 2 |Sing(X)| if and only if the singularities of X

For the convenience of the reader, we supply a proof here.

are ODPs.

Proof. Let Ci be the exceptional curve over an isolated hypersurface singu-
larity pi. We have the identity of the topological Euler numbers

e(bX) − e(eX) = ∑ m(pi) + ∑ (e(Ci) − 1) ,

where m(pi) is the Milnor number of pi. According to [4, (1.3)], the excep-
tion curve Ci is a union of smooth rational curves which meet transversally
and thus the number e(Ci) − 1 is equal to ni the number of irreducible com-
ponents of Ci. Observe that m(pi) and ni are greater than or equal to one.
Then ∑ m(pi) + ∑ ni > 2 |Sing(X)|, and the equality holds if and only if
ni = m(pi) = 1 for all i.
(cid:3)

We conclude this section with an elementary lemma, which will be used

in the proof of Theorem 6.4.

3. CONFIGURATIONS AND PARAMETER SPACES

We start by introducing the conﬁguration of complete intersection vari-

eties of dimension d and constructing their parameter spaces.

THE CONNECTEDNESS OF THE STANDARD WEB OF CALABI–YAU 3-FOLDS

A conﬁguration of dimension d is a pair [VkL] of a smooth projective
variety V and a sequence of line bundles L = (L1, · · · , Lm), where Lj is
generated by global sections. Assume that dim V = m + d. A variety X is
called a member of the conﬁguration and write X ∈ [VkL] if it is deﬁned
by global sections σj of Lj for 1 6 j 6 m and of dim X = d.

reduces the factor to Pn−1). Note that the global sections of Lj are multi-
homogeneous polynomials of multidegree (q1

j , · · · , qk

j ).

Deﬁnition 3.1. Two conﬁguration matrices are said to represent the same
conﬁguration if one can go from one to the other by a permutation of the
rows or of the columns other than ﬁrst. We say that [n1kq1] is a sub-
conﬁguration matrix of [nkq] if

m 0 b (cid:21)

and [nkq] represent the same conﬁguration.

We can explain the meaning of a complete intersection X ∈ [nkq] pre-
cisely by deﬁning a projective family for the conﬁguration [nkq] whose
ﬁbers are complete intersections of multidegree q.

In the following we will write Xi and u as a short form for indeterminates

Xi0, · · · , Xini and u1, · · · , ua respectively. Set R = C[X1; · · · ; Xk].

Let X be deﬁned by a sequence of multi-homogeneous polynomials σ =

(σj) of multidegree q and of dimension d. Let
Φ(1), · · · , Φ(a)

be a basis ofLm

Then U = Aa\q(D) ∋ 0 is the set of points such that H1(K•) vanishes

where q is the projection from Aa+N onto Aa. Let

Consider the projection P : X ⊆ V × Aa → Aa and its restriction
PU : XU → U. Since the the Koszul complex K• is exact on U, all ﬁbers of
PU are complete intersections of multidegree q and have the same Hilbert
polynomial P(t) which is computed by the Koszul resolution and depends
on its multidegree. Hence PU is a ﬂat family with the ﬁber X0 = X [10, III
Thm.9.9]. From this we know that such complete intersections are parame-
terized by an open subset of HilbN

P(t).

To summarize what we have proved, we get the following proposition:

Lm

Proposition 3.2. Given X ∈ [nkq]. Then there is a Zariski open set 0 ∈ U in
j=1 H0(V, Lj) and a ﬂat projective morphism PU : XU → U with the ﬁber
X0 = X such that all complete intersections in V of multidegree q are parameter-
ized by the pair (U, PU).

Hence we may use the conﬁguration [nkq] to denote the parameter space

of complete intersections in V of multidegree q and dimensional d.

The following result is a well known result in [7]. In order to point out
what the fundamental cycle of a smooth member is, we are going to use
Theorem 2.1 to give a proof.

Proposition 3.3. A general member X of a conﬁguration [VkL] is smooth and of
dimension d, where L = (L1, · · · , Lm) is a sequence of globally generated line
Lj|X and the

bundles over V. Moreover, the normal bundle of X in V is Lm

and contractions, one represents the same conﬁguration as other one.

We are going to compute the difference of topological Euler numbers
of smooth members under the formal correspondence of conﬁgurations of

To compute e(bX), we identify the line bundle OPn(1) on Pn with pr∗OPn(1)

According to

Set H = c1(OPn(1)) in A1(Pn × S). An explicit computation show that
q′′′(0) = s1(E )H2 − [2s2(E ) + c1(S)s1(E )] H + [s3(E ) + c1(S)s2(E ) + Cs] ,
where Cs is the class as deﬁned in (3.4).

We regard the class q′′′(0)cn+1(E ⊗ OPn(1)) as a polynomial in H, de-

noted it by Q(H). Then Q(n)(H) is equal to the Hn-term in the class

q′′′(0)(cid:16)c1(E )Hn + c2(E )Hn−1 + c3(E )Hn−2(cid:17) .

there is a smooth irreducible member bX in bC such that the morphism π :

5. CALABI–YAU CONFIGURATIONS

From now on we will suppose that all conﬁgurations are of dimension 3.

Deﬁnition 5.1. A conﬁguration matrix [nkq] is called a complete intersection
Calabi–Yau (CICY) conﬁguration if it satisfy the Calabi–Yau condtion

∑m

j=1 qi

j = ni + 1

for all 1 6 i 6 k.

It is easy to see that CICY conﬁguration matrices are preserved under
formal splitting and contractions. Note that the topological Euler number
of a smooth member which belongs to a CICY conﬁguration matrix is non-
positive [1, (2.28)].

Remark 5.2. We do not allow that a Calaba–Yau 3-fold X is a product of
three elliptic curves or of an elliptic curve and K3 surface since H1(OX) = 0.
Further we are not interested in a conﬁguration matrix which contains the
sub-conﬁguration [1k2] because the sub-conﬁguration describes two points
(counted with multiplicity) in P1. To exclude such cases, we only treat non
block-diagonal CICY conﬁguration matrices.

Let us consider the simple case for all ni = 1 and qi

j = 0 or 2.

Example 5.3. Given a CICY conﬁguration k × (m + 1)-matrix [nkq] with
ni = 1 and qi
j = 0 or 2 for all i, j, we have k = m + 3. By Remark 5.2, we
know that [nkq] is non block-diagonal and thus

∑k

i=1 qi

j > 4

for each column of q. According to the Calabi–Yau condition it follows that

4(k − 3) 6 ∑i,j qi

j = 2k

and therefore 4 6 k 6 6. When k equals 5 or 6, we get a product of an
elliptic curve and K3 surface or of three elliptic curves respectively. By
Remark 5.2, the CICY conﬁguration matrix must be

in this simple case. We denote this conﬁguration matrix by C1111.

The following proposition were proved in [8, Lemma 2], for the conve-

nience of the readers we give a proof here.

Proposition 5.4. [8] Every CICY conﬁguration matrices can be connected for-
mally.

THE CONNECTEDNESS OF THE STANDARD WEB OF CALABI–YAU 3-FOLDS

13

Proof. Given a (non block-diagonal) CICY conﬁguration matrix [nkq] as in
(3.1). We perform formal splittings iteratively until we arrive at a conﬁgu-
ration matrix for which each row entries qi
j with ni > 1 are 0 or 1 (for exam-
ple, introducing a sub-conﬁguration matrix [1k11] to split it). Perform next
formal contractions in a way that ﬁnally leaves each ni = 1 and qi
j = 0 or 2.
Notice that non block-diagonal CICY conﬁguration matrices are preserved
under formal splittings and contractions. According to Example 5.3, it fol-
lows that the conﬁguration matrix is the simple conﬁguration C1111.
(cid:3)

The following proposition is an application of Theorem 2.1, which is a
well known result in [7]. The remaining task is to prove that a general CICY
member is irreducible and H1(O) = 0 by using a suitable Lefschetz-type
theorem for an ample reducible divisor.

Proposition 5.5. A general member of a CICY conﬁguration matrix is a smooth
Calabi–Yau 3-fold.

j , · · · , qk

Proof. Given a CICY conﬁguration matrix [nkq], let V = ∏k
i=1 Pni. Let Lj
be the line bundle with the multidegree (q1
j ). By Proposition 3.3,
it sufﬁces to prove that a general smooth member X ∈ [nkq] is connected
and H1(OX) = 0. Note that the canonical bundle of X is trivial by the
adjunction formula. Therefore we only need to prove that H0(X, C) and
H1(X, C) have dimension one and zero respectively.

Pick a general section (sj) ∈Lm

j=1 H0(V, Lj) for which the divisor Dj :=
Z(sj) is a smooth and connected with all subsets of the Dj’s meeting trans-

j=1 Dj, we get exact sequences [2, (2.1)], for i = 0, 1,

By induction, it follows that the dimension of L|J|=r H0(DJ, C) is (m
and ofL|J|=r H1(DJ, C) is zero for the length r < m. We remark that the

induction process works because every DJ has the form D′
J × ∏ Pnl with
D′ = ∑ D′
j is ample. Hence the connectedness and simple connectedness
of DJ can be proved in the similar way as shown before. Using the se-
quence (5.1) and dimension counting, we get the dimension of H0(X, C)
and H1(X, C) are one and zero respectively.

As a byproduct of the proof of Proposition 5.5, we obtain the following

second Betti number formula:

Proposition 5.6. With the notation as in the proof of Proposition 5.5,

b2(X, C) = (−1)m m +

m−1
∑
r=1

(−1)r ∑

b2(DJ, C)! .

Moreover, the second Betti number of X equals the second Betti number of the
ambient space V if b2(DJ, C) = b2(V, C) for each 1 6 |J| < m.
Proof. By V = ∏m
i=1 Pni and K ¨unneth formula, the second Betti number of
V equals m. Since dim V > m + 2, the exact sequence (5.1) holds for i = 2
and the proposition follows.
(cid:3)

Remark 5.7. For a Calabu–Yau 3-fold X, the topological Euler number e(X)
is 2(h1,1(X) − h2,1(X)). To know the Hodge number h1,1(X) and h2,1(X), it
sufﬁces to compute either one of these two Hodge numbers and e(X). In
[9], ﬁnding these Hodge numbers corresponding to a given CICY conﬁgu-
ration matrix is in principle just a matter of looking up the relevant matrix
in the list. Those calculated in [9] for the 7868 CICY matrices constructed
in [1]. Proposition 5.6 gives a direct calculation of h1,1(X) = b2(X, C) for X
in any given CICY conﬁguration matrix.

The remark is illustrated by the following example which was given in

the appendix of [9].

Example 5.8. Consider

fore b2(D) = e(D) − 2 = 4 and the second Betti number of X is 5.

We are now ready to prove the connectedness of parameter spaces of

CICY conﬁguration matrices.

Theorem 5.9. Any two (parameter spaces of) complete intersection Calabi–Yau
3-folds in product of projective spaces are connected by a ﬁnite sequence of conifold
transitions.

Proof. By Proposition 5.4 and Theorem 4.2, every CICY conﬁguration ma-
trices connect formally and each formal contraction gives a determinantal

contraction bX → X, which is an isomorphism or a small projective resolu-

tion, say X ∈ C . According to Corollary 3.5 and Corollary 4.4, it follows

THE CONNECTEDNESS OF THE STANDARD WEB OF CALABI–YAU 3-FOLDS

15

that e(bX) − e(eX) = 2 |Sing(X)|, where eX ∈ C is a general smooth member.

By Proposition 2.3, the singularities of X are ODPs. Hence each parameter
space [nkq] connects to the simple one C1111 by conifold transitions.

It shall be related to the ﬁber products of rational elliptic surfaces which
was investigated in [25].

Let fi

: Si → P1 be a relatively minimal, rational, elliptic surface with
section for i = 1, 2. Then Si is the 9-fold blowing up of P2 at the base points
of a cubic pencil which induces the ﬁbration fi [18, IV.1.2], that is, there are
generic homogeneous cubic polynomials ai and bi such that Si ⊆ P2 × P1
is a resolution of indeterminacy of the rational map Ci : P2 99K P1 deﬁned
by Ci(x) = [ai(x) : bi(x)]. Obviously, Si is deﬁned by

Pi(z, x) = z1ai(x) − z0bi(x) = 0

where [z0 : z1] ∈ P1 and x ∈ P2.

Let W = S1 ×P1 S2. It is well known that W is a Calabi–Yau 3-fold [25].
It is easy to see that W can be obtained as a CICY in P2 × P2 × P1 deﬁned

by P1 and P2. Therefore W ∈ bC and is birational to a member in C which is

deﬁned by the bicubic polynomial a0(x)b1(x) − a1(x)b0(x) = 0.

We prefer to identify Calabi–Yau 3-folds which can be connected by a
sequence of ﬂops. The reason is that many invariants are preserved under
ﬂops, e.g. quantum invariance [17, 16] (see also [26] for a survey on re-
cent development), the miniversal deformation spaces [14, (12.6)], analytic
type of singularities [12, (4.11)], integral cohomology groups, etc. (see [13,
(3.2.2)]). Here is an example to illustrate the principle.

P3(3)). By Proposition 5.5, there is a

H0(P, L ) ≃ (Γ · x2) ⊕ (Γ · xy) ⊕ (Γ · y2)

such that each section in the open set deﬁnes a smooth Calabi–Yau 3-fold.
Choose general cubic polynomials A, B and C on P3 so that the Calabi–

is smooth and the octic hypersurface S in P3 deﬁned by ∆ := B2 − 4AC ∈
H0(P3, O

P3(8)) is smooth. Let bX be the double cover of P3 branched over
S. Since S is smooth, we can show that bX is a smooth Calabi–Yau 3-fold.
The Calabi–Yau bX, called double solids, was ﬁrstly studied by Clemens [3].
We are going to prove that the Calabi–Yau X and the double solid bX

are birational smooth Calabi–Yau 3-folds. Indeed, we choose a open set
U in P3 such that O
P3(4)|U ≃ OU and A|U, ∆|U are nowhere zero. Let
V = {[x : y] ∈ P1 | y 6= 1}. On W := U × V, we rewrite the equation

We review the deﬁnition of (projective) small transitions.

Deﬁnition 6.1. LetbX → X be a small projective resolution of a Calabi–Yau 3-
Yau manifold eX, then the process of going from bX to eX is called a small
transition and denoted by a diagram bX → X   eX. It is called a conifold

transition if all singularities of X are ODPs.

Conifold transitions play a fundamental role in Reid’s fantasy [23, Sec-
tion 8] (cf. §1), which conjectures that all the moduli spaces of smooth
Calabi–Yau 3-folds are connected through conifold transitions. As in the
previous section the moduli spaces of CICY 3-folds in product of projective
spaces are connected to each other by conifold transitions (cf. [8] and The-
orem 4.2). A special yet fundamental question arising from Reid’s fantasy
is the following:

Question 1. Let bX → X   eX be a small transition. Is that true bX can be
connected to eX by a conifold transition (through a different X of course)?

For a Calabi–Yau 3-fold X, Namikawa and Steenbrink proved that X can
be deformed to a Calabi–Yau 3-fold with at worst ODPs [19]. In view of this

result, it seems that one may possibly answer Question 1 afﬁrmatively by

ﬁnding a deformation direction of bX which deforms bX → X into bX1 → X1

with X1 being a Calabi–Yau conifold. Unfortunately, Namikawa produced
a counterexample to this in [21, Remark 2.8]. We recall it brieﬂy as follows:
Choose a suitable rational elliptic surface S with six singular ﬁbers of
type II (i.e., cuspidal rational curves). Let X = S ×P1 S. Then X is a Calabi–
Yau 3-fold with six singular points of cA2 type:
x2 − y3 = u2 − v3,

which admits smoothings to eX = S1 ×P1 S2 with Si → P1 having disjoint
discriminant loci. A small resolution π : bX → X can also be constructed

(see below). Namikawa observed that the exceptional loci should not be
deformed to a disjoint union of (−1, −1)-curves. The reason is that a sin-
gular ﬁber of type II splits up into at most two singular ﬁbers of type I, and
a general ﬁber of small deformation of a singularity of X which preserves
small resolutions has three ODPs.

To search for a modiﬁcation of Question 1, we need to study Namikawa’s
construction of the small resolution π carefully. Notice that the diagonal
D ∼= S in X is a smooth Weil divisor which contains the six singular points
and is thus not Q-Cartier. On the other hand, there is a τ ∈ Aut(X) such
that Dτ := τ(D) has the same properties as D. Then X′
:= BlDX has
six ODPs and the exceptional locus of X′ → X consists of six mutually
disjoint P1s, with each of them passing through one of the six ODPs. Now
the small resolution can be constructed as the blowing up of X′ along the

proper transform eDτ of Dτ, with π being composed of morphisms bX →

X′ → X. It admits exceptional trees, composed of couples of rational curves
intersecting at one point.

Now comes the key point. Using Friedman’s criterion, X′ → X can be
deformed to a small resolution Y′ → Y where Y′ is smooth and Y has only

ODPs. Thus we have decomposed the small transition bX → X   eX into
two conifold transitions bX → X′   Y′ and Y′ → Y   eX:

X′

bX = BleDτ

Y′

X′ = BlDX

Y

X

eX.

Combining the above discussions, we modify Question 1 as follows:

Question 2. Let bX → X   eX be a small transition. Up to deformations
of contractions, is that true bX can be connected to eX through a sequence of

conifold transitions?

To attack Question 2, we introduce primitive small transitions:

satisﬁes the following two conditions:

the analytic type of singularities of X and Y are the same.

X′
spaces is an isomorphism.

Deﬁnition 6.2. A small transition bX π−→ X   eX is said to be primitive if it

Proposition 6.3. Let π : bX → X be a small projective resolution of a Calabi–
Yau 3-fold X. Suppose that, for any Calabi–Yau 3-fold bX′ which is birationally
equivalent to bX and any factorization bX′ → X′ → X with X′ 6= bX′, the Calabi–
Yau 3-fold X′ is not smoothable. Then the closed immersion Def(bX) ֒→ Def(X′)
Proof. According to that bX and bX′ are connected by a sequence of ﬂops

[11, 12] and the Kuranishi spaces are unchanged under ﬂops [14, (12.6)],
Proposition 6.3 follows from [21, (2.5)]. Remark that X is not smoothable
by hypothesis.
(cid:3)

of Kuranishi spaces is an isomorphism.

According to Proposition 6.3, it follows that every small transition can
be decomposed into primitive small transitions up to deformations and
ﬂops. If we want to approach Question 2, understanding primitive small
transitions becomes essential. The following theorem provides the ﬁrst step
towards this problem:

We note that Theorem 6.4 is a generalization of [6, (5.1)].

If any two curves have non-empty intersection, say C1 and C2, we let F

precisely ρ generators of the ρ-dimensional cone NE(bX/X). Let π′ : bX →
X′ be the contraction of the (KbX + εE)-negative extremal face F. By the

induction hypothesis, the singularities of X′ consist of exactly two ODPs
and Exc(π′) = C1 ∐ C2. This contradicts to that C1 ∩ C2 6= ∅, and thus
Exc(π) is a disjoint union of irreducible rational curves.

By the induction hypothesis and the Cone theorem, we infer that the

factorization bX → Y → X, the singularities of Y are ODPs.

Question 3. Can one classiﬁes primitive small transitions? Or more am-
bitiously, is that true a primitive small transition is necessarily a conifold
transition?

It amounts to studying the global deformation theory of the small con-

traction bX → X. Notice that in the case of standard web (CICY inside

product of projective spaces, Theorem 5.9), we have used a Bertini-type
theorem for degeneracy loci to play the role of the required deformation
theory. For a general small transition, a deeper analysis of globalizing the
local deformations is needed.
