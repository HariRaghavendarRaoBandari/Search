Multidimensional solitons: Well-established results and novel ﬁndings

Department of Physical Electronics, School of Electrical Engineering,
Faculty of Engineering, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel

Boris A. Malomed

A brief review is given of some well-known and some very recent results obtained in studies of
two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) solitons. Both zero-vorticity (fundamental) solitons and
ones carrying vorticity S = 1 are considered. Physical realizations of multidimensional solitons in
atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and nonlinear optics are brieﬂy discussed too. Unlike 1D
solitons, which are typically stable, 2D and 3D ones are vulnerable to the instability induced by
the occurrence of the critical and supercritical collapse, respectively, in the same 2D and 3D models
that give rise to the solitons. Vortex solitons are subject to a still stronger splitting instability. For
this reason, a central problem is looking for physical settings in which 2D and 3D solitons may be
stabilized. The review addresses one well-established topic, viz., the stabilization of the 3D and
2D states, with S = 0 and 1, trapped in harmonic-oscillator (HO) potentials, and another topic
which was developed very recently: the stabilization of 2D and 3D free-space solitons, which mix
components with S = 0 and ±1 (semi-vortices and mixed modes), in a binary system with the spin-
orbit coupling (SOC) between its components. In both cases, the generic situations are drastically
diﬀerent in the 2D and 3D geometries. In the former case, the stabilization mechanism creates a
stable ground state (GS, which was absent without it), whose norm falls below the threshold value
at which the critical collapse sets in. In the 3D geometry, the supercritical collapse does not allow
to create a GS, but metastable solitons can be constructed.

List of acronyms: GPE – Gross-Pitaevskii equation; GS – ground state; HO – harmonic-oscillator (potential);
MM – mixed mode; NLSE – nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation; SOC – spin-orbit coupling; SV – semi-vortex; VA –
variational approximation; VK – Vakhitov-Kolokolov (stability criterion)

I.

INTRODUCTION

Self-trapping of multidimensional (two- and three-dimensional, 2D and 3D) localized modes in nonlinear disper-
sive/diﬀractive media, which are usually categorized as solitons, has been a topic of great interest in many areas of
physics, as can be seen from reviews [1]-[3]. In particular, this area of the theoretical and experimental studies is highly
relevant to nonlinear optics, as well as to nonlinear dynamics of matter waves in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs).
Other essential realizations of multidimensional solitons are known in models of ferromagnets [4], superconductors [5],
and semiconductors [6], as well as in nuclear physics [7], the classical-ﬁeld theory [8, 9] (including famous skyrmions
[10], which may be considered as 3D solitons), and other ﬁelds.

In addition to the their signiﬁcance to fundamental studies, 2D and 3D solitons oﬀer potential applications. In
particular, spatiotemporal optical solitons, alias “light bullets” [11], may be used as data carriers in all-optical data-
processing schemes [12], and 3D matter-wave solitons are expected to provide a basis for highly precise interferometry
[13].

Unlike 1D solitons, which are usually stable objects [2, 14], stability is a major issue for their 2D and 3D counterparts.
Indeed, the most common cubic self-focusing nonlinearity, which can easily support 2D and 3D formal solitons
solutions, gives rise to the wave collapse (critical collapse in 2D and supercritical collapse in 3D) [15], which completely
destabilizes the respective soliton families.
In particular, the ﬁrst ever example of solitons which was introduced
theoretically in nonlinear optics, viz., the Townes solitons [16], i.e., 2D self-trapped modes supported by the cubic self-
focusing nonlinearity (in fact, these solutions were discovered before term “soliton” had been coined) are subject to the
instability caused by the critical collapse, therefore they have never been observed in the experiment. Multidimensional
solitons with embedded vorticity, alias 2D vortex rings and 3D vortex tori, which also exist in cubic media (in
particular, there are higher-order versions of Townes solitons with embedded vorticity [17]), are vulnerable to a
still stronger splitting instability initiated by modulational perturbations in the azimuthal direction; usually, the
modulational instability splits the vortex ring into a few fragments, which resemble fundamental (zero-vorticity)
solitons and suﬀer the destruction via the intrinsic collapse or decay into small-amplitude waves (“radiation”) [1].

Thus, the stabilization of multidimensional fundamental and vortex solitons in physically relevant models is an
issue of great signiﬁcance to theoretical studies, and creation of the solitons in the respective physical settings is a
challenge to the experiment. This paper oﬀers a short review of the broad area of theoretical investigations of 2D and
3D solitons, selecting two topics for a relatively detailed presentation, one well-established, and one very recent. The
former one, considered in Section II, relies upon the stabilization of both fundamental (zero-vorticity) solitons and

2

ones with embedded vorticity S = 1 by an external harmonic-oscillator (HO) trapping potential, axially or spherically
symmetric one. This topic has been elaborated in detail in the course of the past 20 years [18–22]. A recently
developed theme, presented in Section III, is the creation of stable solitons in the 2D and 3D free space (without the
help from any external potential), which mix zero-vorticity and vortical components, by means of linear terms that
account for the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in binary BEC. This possibility for 2D and 3D solitons was discovered in
Refs. [23] and [24], respectively.

Any stabilization mechanism must secure the solitons against the critical collapse in 2D settings, and against the
supercritical collapse in the 3D geometry. This objective is achieved diﬀerently in 2D and 3D models, as explained
below.
In the former case, the stabilizing factor breaks the speciﬁc scale invariance, which underlies the critical
collapse, and transforms any originally unstable fundamental soliton in the single-component model, or a mixed
(fundamental-vortical) soliton in the binary SOC system, into a ground state (GS), which does not exists in the
unstabilized 2D model. This is possible because the critical collapse sets in when the norm of the mode exceeds a
certain threshold value, and the solitons get stabilized by pushing their norm below the collapse threshold. Vortex
solitons with S = 1 in the 2D single-component model may be stabilized too, as excited states, rather than the
GS, provided that their norms are not too large either. On the other hand, in the 3D setting the threshold for the
onset of the supercritical collapse is absent, hence a true GS cannot be created. Nevertheless, the stabilization of 3D
fundamental solitons and vortical ones with S = 1 in the single-component model, and of 3D mixed modes in the
SOC system, is possible in the form of metastable states, which are robust against small perturbations.

II. MULTIDIMENSIONAL SOLITONS IN TRAPPING POTENTIALS

A. The basic model

A generic method for the stabilization of both fundamental and vortical solitons is the use of trapping potentials, the
corresponding model being based on the following nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation (NLSE), alias the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation (GPE) [25], for the atomic mean-ﬁeld wave function ψ (r, t), where r = (x, y, z) (or r = (x, y) in the 2D
geometry) and t are appropriately scaled spatial coordinates and time:

i

∂ψ
∂t

1
2∇2ψ + U (r) ψ − |ψ|2ψ.

= −

(1)

Here, ∇2 is the 3D or 2D Laplacian, U (r) is the trapping potential, and the negative sign in front of the cubic term
implies that the nonlinearity is self-attractive. The trapping potential in the 3D setting may be quasi-two-dimensional,
i.e., U = U (x, y) [26].

In the application to optics, the evolution variable in Eq. (1) is replaced by the propagation distance (z), while
the longitudinal coordinate is replaced by the local time, τ ≡ t − z/Vgr, where Vgr is the group velocity of the
electromagnetic carrier waves [2]. In this case, the trapping potential, which deﬁnes a waveguiding channel in the
bulk medium by means of the local modulation of the refractive index, δn = −U (x, y), may be only quasi-two-
dimensional, as it is virtually important to impose modulation of the refractive index providing the trapping in the
temporal direction. The 2D version of Eq. (1), with the propagation distance z replacing t , models the evolution of
spatial light beams in the bulk medium with transverse coordinates (x, y).

Axially symmetric potentials (including spherically isotropic ones), U = U (ρ, z), where (ρ, z, θ) is the set of cylin-

drical coordinates, admit looking for solutions to Eq. (1) in the form of vortex modes,

with real chemical potential µ and integer vorticity S. Real amplitude function R (ρ, z) satisﬁes the stationary
equation,

ψ = exp (−iµt + iSθ) R(ρ, z),

where Ω2 accounts for the anisotropy of the trap, determining the aspect ratio, √Ω, between trapping lengths in

two-dimensional (“pancake-shaped”, see Ref. [27] and references therein) and nearly one-dimensional (“cigar-shaped”
[28]) condensates. Equation (1) conserves the energy,

with ∗ standing for the complex conjugate (in the case of the isotropic trap, Ω = 1, all the three components of the
angular momentum are conserved). For the stationary state (2) with a deﬁnite value of S, relation Mz = SN holds.
In this section, the basic results for the structure and stability of trapped solitons and solitary vortices are summa-
rized for the HO potential (4), following, chieﬂy, Refs. [21] and [22]. On the other hand, spatially periodic (lattice)
potentials also oﬀer an eﬃcient tool for the stabilization of 2D and 3D fundamental and vortex solitons, as was pre-
dicted in various settings [26, 29], and demonstrated experimentally for 2D optical solitons with embedded vorticity
in photonic lattices [30], and for 2D plasmon-polariton solitons in microcavities with a lattice structure [31].

B. Stationary 3D modes: analytical and numerical results

Before proceeding to the presentation of numerical ﬁndings, it is relevant to display approximate analytical results
which are available in the present setting. In the linear limit, Eq. (1) is tantamount to the quantum-mechanical
Schr¨odinger equation for the 3D anisotropic HO. In the Cartesian coordinates, the corresponding eigenfunctions are
built as

ψjkl(x, y, z, t) = e−iµ0tΦj(x)Φk(y)Φl(cid:16)√Ωz(cid:17) ,

where Φj, Φk and Φl are stationary wave functions of 1D harmonic oscillators with quantum numbers j, k, l, which
correspond to energy eigenvalues j + 1/2, k + 1/2 and (l + 1/2) Ω, respectively, the full chemical potential being

µ0 = j + k + 1 + (l + 1/2) Ω .

(9)

The states which go over into ones (2) with vorticity S in the nonlinear model are constructed as combinations of
factorized wave functions (8) with l = 0 and j + k = S. Since the correction to µ from the self-attractive nonlinearity
is negative, this restriction and Eq. (9) with l = 0 impose a bound on µ,

(8)

(10)

(11)

(12)

In particular, the eigenfunctions of the linear model, with vorticities S = 1 and S = 2, are

µ ≤ µ0 = S + 1 + (1/2)Ω.

ψ(S=1)

linear = ψ100 + iψ010 ≡ ρ exp(cid:2)− (2 + Ω/2) it + iθ −(cid:0)ρ2 + z2(cid:1) /2(cid:3) ,

ψ(S=2)

linear = ψ200 − ψ020 + 2iψ110 ≡ ρ2 exp(cid:2)− (3 + Ω/2) it + 2iθ −(cid:0)ρ2 + z2(cid:1) /2(cid:3) .

To apply the variational approximation (VA) [32] to the nonlinear model, note that Eq. (3) can be derived from

FIG. 1: (a) The chemical potential and (b) energy, deﬁned as per Eq. (5), versus norm N for the fundamental (S = 0) modes
trapped in anisotropic HO potential (4) with Ω = 10, 1, and 0.1, as found from numerical solution of Eq. (3). Solid and dotted
portions of the curves denote, respectively, stable and unstable parts of the solution families, as identiﬁed by a numerical
solution of the eigenvalue problem based on Bogoliubov - de Gennes equations (16). See further details in Ref. [22].

A natural ansatz for the trapped vortices is

R(ρ, z) = AρS

where amplitude A, as well as the radial and vertical widths, ρ0 and z0, are free parameters, norm (6) of this ansatz
being N =(cid:0)π3/2S!(cid:1) M, M ≡ A2ρ4
0h0 (below, M replaces A as one of variational parameters). The trapped modes with
S ≥ 1 are shaped as vortex tori (“doughnuts”), see a typical example below in Fig. 4. This shape is (qualitatively)
correctly captured by ansatz (14).
Further results produced by the VA are given here for S = 0 and 1, as all vortices with S ≥ 2
The substitution of ansatz (14) with S = 1 in Lagrangian (13) yields L =
(√π/8) Mh−4µ + z−2
0z0(cid:1)−1i. The ﬁrst variational equation, ∂L/∂ρ0 = 0, yields
M = 8√2(cid:0)1 − ρ4
0(cid:1) h0, which predicts that the vortex may only exist if it is narrow enough in the radial direction, ρ0 <
0(cid:2)1 − 2 (1 − µ) ρ2

0 = 0.
Numerical solution of the variational equations generates µ(N ) dependences for families of the fundamental (S = 0)
and vortical (S = 1) trapped modes which are displayed, severally, in Figs. 1(a) and 2(a) for Ω = 10, 1, and 0.1, which
correspond to the pancake-like, isotropic, and cigar-shaped conﬁgurations, respectively, while the corresponding E(N )
curves are displayed in Figs 1(b) and 2(b). The same dependences, obtained from numerical solution of stationary
equation (3), are displayed too, demonstrating the accuracy of the VA. It is seen that the properties of the modes
trapped in the isotropic (Ω = 1) and cigar-shaped (Ω = 0.1) HO potentials are quite close, being strongly diﬀerent
from those is the pancake trap (Ω = 10). Another obvious feature of the ﬁgure is the presence of a largest norm, which
corresponds to the turning point of the µ(N ) curve and bounds the existence of the trapped modes. This limitation
is caused by the presence of the supercritical collapse in the 3D model [15]: if the norm is too large, the trend to the
collapse, driven by the cubic self-attraction, cannot be balanced by the quantum pressure (the gradient part of energy
(5)). The largest norm in this model was numerically found, as a function Ω, in Ref.
[19]. Another implication of
the possibility of the supercritical collapse is that all the stable modes found in the 3D model are actually metastable
ones. They cannot play the role of the GS, which does not exist in the model admitting the supercritical collapse.

C. Stability of trapped 3D fundamental and vortex modes

The stability of stationary solutions produced by Eq.

(3) is identiﬁed through the computation of (generally,

complex) eigenvalues λ of small perturbations. To this end, a perturbed solution to Eq. (1) is looked for as

ψ(x, y, z, t) = [R(ρ, z) + u(ρ, z) exp(λt + iLθ) + v∗(ρ, z) exp(λ∗t − iLθ)] exp (iSθ − iµt) ,

supplemented by the boundary conditions demanding that u(ρ, z) and v(ρ, z) decay exponentially at ρ → ∞ and
|z| → ∞, and decay as ρ|S±L| at ρ → 0. The stability of the underlying stationary mode is secured by the condition
that all eigenvalues λ produced by numerical solution of Eq. (16) [20] must be pure imaginary. The ﬁndings are
included in Figs. 1 and 2, where stable and unstable portions of the solution families are distinguished. The results
of the stability analysis are collected in the diagram which displays stability regions in the plane of (µ, Ω) in Fig. 3.
The stability of the fundamental trapped states (S = 0) precisely complies with the Vakhitov-Kolokolov (VK)
criterion [15, 33], dµ/dN ≤ 0, which is a necessary but, in the general case, not suﬃcient stability condition. On the
other hand, the stability region of the vortex mode with S = 1 is essentially smaller than formally predicted by this
criterion. In the region with the VK criterion still holds for the vortices, but they are actually unstable, they are
vulnerable to the above-mentioned splitting instability induced by perturbations with L = 2 and 3 in Eq. (15). The
vortex modes with S ≥ 2 were found to be completely unstable.
A noteworthy feature revealed by Figs. 1 and 2 is that the smallest and largest maximum values of N , up to which
the trapped modes with S = 0 or S = 1 remain stable, are achieved, respectively, at the largest and smallest values of
Ω. In particular, the quasi-1D “tubular” vortical modes with S = 1 [34], which are generated by the model at Ω ≪ 1,
are tightly conﬁned in the corresponding cigar-shaped trap, that suppresses their destabilization by the splitting.
As said above, at Ω → ∞ the 3D setting shrinks into its 2D counterpart, where trapped modes with S = 1 have a
ﬁnite stability region, µ0 − µcr ≈ 0.724, see below. Therefore, taking into regard that Eq. (10) yields µ0(Ω) = 2 + Ω/2
for S = 1, the lower stability border (µ = µcr) for S = 1 in Fig. 3 becomes, at large Ω, asymptotically linear and
parallel to the upper existence border, µcr ≈ µ0(Ω)− 0.724 = 1.276 + Ω/2. On the other hand, the stability region for
the fundamental trapped modes expands at Ω → ∞, because the entire fundamental family is stable in the 2D limit,
see below too.
The predictions for the stability based on the computation of the stability eigenvalues are corroborated by direct
simulations of Eq.
(1), starting with stationary modes to which small arbitrary perturbations are added. The
robustness of stable vortices is illustrated by Fig. 4, which demonstrates that they absorb the perturbations and clean
up themselves.

Lastly, it is relevant to stress that stable matter-wave solitons, created experimentally in condensates of 7Li [28]
and 85Rb [35] atoms loaded in cigar-shaped traps, may be well described by the above solutions for Ω ≃ 0.1 − 0.05.
On the other hand, stable solitons were also observed in the post-collapse state of the 85Rb condensate trapped in
the HO potential with Ω ≈ 0.4, which is much closer to the isotropic conﬁguration.

vortex at t = 0, and the shape at t = 120. The unperturbed vortex has chemical potential µ = 2 and norm N = 12.55.

D. 2D fundamental and vortex trapped modes

As said above, taking the limit of Ω → ∞ in HO potential (4) leads to the shrinkage of the 3D model into its 2D
simpliﬁcation, with Eqs. (GPE), (3), (5), (6), (7), and (16) carrying over into their 2D counterparts, and the 2D HO
potential taking the form of U (x, y) = (1/2)(cid:0)x2 + y2(cid:1). In particular, stationary solutions of the 2D version of Eq.
(1) are looked for as ψ = exp (−iµt + iSθ) R(ρ), cf. Eq. (2), where µ is realized as the chemical potential of the 2D
model, i.e., its limit form corresponding to the linear equation is

µ(2D)
0 = S + 1,

(17)

7

cf. Eq. (10).

The shape and stability of the 2D trapped modes was studied in a number of works [18, 21]. The results, produced
by the computation of the stability eigenvalues in the framework of the 2D version of Eq. (16), are summarized in Fig.
5, which demonstrates that the family of the fundamental (S = 0) trapped modes is entirely stable in its existence
region,

0 ≤ N < N (S=0)

max ≈ 5.85,

(18)

max

where N (S=0)
is the numerically found value of the norm of the Townes soliton, which determines the threshold
for the onset of the critical collapse in the 2D NLSE [15] (the variational method makes it possible to produce an
analytical approximation, N (S=0)
max ≈ 2π, with a relative error ≈ 7% [37]). In the free space (in the absence of any
trapping potential), the family of the Townes solitons is degenerate, in the sense that they all have the single value
of the norm, which is exactly equal to N (S=0)
max , independently of the soliton’s chemical potential, µ. The degeneracy
is a consequence of the speciﬁc scaling invariance of the NLSE in 2D [15]. The trapping potential introduces a
characteristic spatial scale (the standard HO length, in dimensional units, or merely the spatial period, in the case
of lattice potentials), which breaks the scaling invariance and thus lifts the degeneracy, making N a function of µ.
In fact, Eq. (18) demonstrates that the degeneracy is lifted so that the soliton’s norm falls below the collapse-onset
threshold. This circumstance lends the trapped modes with S = 0 protection against the collapse, i.e.,, stability, and
actually makes them the system’s GS, which did not exist in the absence of the trapping potential. This is a major
diﬀerence from the stabilization mechanism provided by the trapping potential in 3D, where, as said above, the GS
cannot exist (as the supercritical collapse is possible at any value of the norm), and only metastability of the trapped
modes is possible.

The family of Townes solitons with embedded vorticity S = 1 is degenerate too in the free space, being pinned to
max ≈ 24.1 [17]. As seen in Fig. 5, the HO trapping potential stabilizes them in

the single value of the norm, N (S=1)
interval

0 ≤ N < 7.79 ≈ 0.32N (S=1)
max ,

(19)

the corresponding stability interval in terms of the chemical potential being 1.27575 ≡ µcr < µ ≡ µ(2D)
(S = 1) ≡ 2
(the right edge of the interval is determined by Eq. (17)). As for the vortices with S ≥ 2, they remain completely
unstable, as in the 3D model.
The stability of the trapped vortex modes with S = 1, predicted through the computation of the corresponding

0

eigenvalues, was corroborated by direct simulations of the perturbed evolution, see a typical example in Fig. 6.

The direct simulations also reveal an interesting dynamical regime of the trapped vortices with S = 1 in interval

0.32N (S=1)

max ≈ 7.79 < N < 10.30 ≈ 0.43N (S=1)
max ,

(20)

adjacent to one given by Eq. (19). In this interval, the evolution of the unstable vortex is regular (time-periodic), as
shown in Fig. 7: it spits into two fragments which then recombine back into the vortex. The splitting-recombination
cycles recur periodically, keeping the vorticity of the conﬁguration. In this dynamical regime, the trapped vortices
may be considered as semi-stable modes.

N ≈ 10.30, is close to the double collapse threshold of the fundamental solitons, 2N (S=0)

The vortices with still larger values of the norm, N > 10.30, also split into two fragments, which, however, fail to
recombine. Instead, each one quickly blows up, i.e., collapses. Note that the corresponding eﬀective collapse threshold,
max ≈ 11.70, which is consistent
A noteworthy generalization of the above analysis was performed for a system of two nonlinearily coupled ﬁelds,
which may be realized as a binary BEC, or as the copropagation of two optical beams in a bulk waveguide [38]. The
respective coupled 2D GPE/NLSE system is

with the observation that the two fragments tend to suﬀer the intrinsic collapse if they do not recombine.

gives rise to composite modes with hidden vorticity, formed by the components with equal norms N/2 and opposite

III. STABILIZATION OF 2D AND 3D SEMI-VORTEX AND MIXED-MODE SOLITONS BY THE

SPIN-ORBIT COUPLING

A. The models

In this section, in contrast to the previous one, which outlined well-known results, established between 10 and 20
years ago [18, 21, 22], very recent ﬁndings are summarized, which put forward a completely new approach to the
stabilization of vorticity-carrying 2D and 3D solitons in free space, i.e., without the use of any external potential. The
novel stabilization mechanism can be realized in recently introduced models of binary (pseudo-spinor) atomic BEC
with the SOC.

A great deal of attention has been lately drawn to the use of ultracold quantum gases, both bosonic and fermionic,
as simulators of various fundamental eﬀects that were previously predicted and/or discovered experimentally in much
more complex settings of condensed-matter physics [39]. In particular, much interest has been recently attracted to
the implementation of the (pseudo-) SOC in atomic BEC, as an eﬃcient emulation of the fundamental SOC and
Zeeman-splitting eﬀects in semiconductors, where SOC is induced by the coupling of the electron’s magnetic moment
to the magnetic ﬁeld generated by the intrinsic electrostatic ﬁeld of the crystal in the reference frame moving along
with the electron [40, 41].The experimental implementation of the pseudo-SOC was proposed [42] and realized in

the condensate of 87Rb atoms, using appropriately designed laser illumination and magnetic ﬁelds [43]. Parallel to
that, a large number of theoretical studies on this topic have been carried out [44]-[49], [23, 24]. Reviews of this
ﬁeld are available too [50]. The SOC emulation in the atomic condensate is provided by mapping the spinor wave
function of semiconductor electrons onto a two-component pseudo-spinor wave function of the binary BEC composed
of atoms in two diﬀerent hyperﬁne states. Namely, a pair of states of the 87Rb atom, |ψ+i = |F = 1, mF = 0i and
|ψ−i = |F = 1, mF = −1i, were used to map the spin-up and spin-down electron’s wave function into them [43]. Thus,
the dynamics of the fermionic wave functions of electrons in the semiconductor can be mapped into the mean-ﬁeld
dynamics of the bosonic gas.

The consideration of the interplay of the SOC, which is, essentially, a linear mixing between the two components of
the spatially inhomogeneous binary BEC, and the intrinsic nonlinearity in the bosonic condensate has made it possible
to predict diverse nonlinear patterns strongly aﬀected or created by the SOC, including a variety of 1D solitons [45],
2D gap solitons supported by optical-lattice potentials [46], and 2D vortices and vortex lattices, in forms speciﬁc to
the SO-coupled BEC [47].

Here, we will consider the 2D model of the binary SOC BEC based on the following system of based on the following

FIG. 7: Periodic evolution of the unstable vortex with S = 1, µ = 1.2 and N = 8.48, which belongs to interval (20) of the semi-
stability, as per Ref. [21] In this dynamical regime, the trapped mode periodically splits into two fragments and recombines,

where ∇2 = ∂2/∂x2 + ∂2/∂y2, σx,y,z are the Pauli matrices, λ is a real coeﬃcient of the SOC of the Rashba type
(the Dresselhaus coupling, with combination σx∂/∂x − σy∂/∂y, instead of −σy∂/∂x + σx∂/∂y in Eq. (22), is not
considered here, as it tends to destroy 2D solitons, rather than to create them [51]), η is the relative strength of the
cross-attraction between the components (cf. Eq. (21a)), under the condition that the strength of the self-attraction
is normalized to be 1, and Ω is the strength of the Zeeman splitting. Coeﬃcient 1/λ has the dimension of length,
deﬁning a ﬁxed scale which breaks the above-mentioned scale invariance of the NLSE/GPE in the free 2D space. This
eﬀect makes it possible to create stable solitons with norms falling below the collapse threshold, see below.

The consistent derivation of the eﬀective 2D SOC model from the full 3D system of GPEs may give rise to the 2D
equations with nonpolynomial nonlinearity, as a generalization of the cubic terms in Eq. (22) [48]. This generalized
system also creates stable solitons in the 2D free space. Another relevant generalization addresses a model of a dual-
core nonlinear coupler in optics, where the SOC is emulated by temporal dispersion of the linear inter-core coupling
[53]. It was demonstrated that this model gives rise to stable 2D spatiotemporal solitons (“light bullets”).

B. Stable 2D solitons: standing and mobile semi-vortices and mixed modes

1.

2D semi-vortices (at Ω = 0)

First, we note that Eq. (22) with Ω = 0 (in the absence of the Zeeman splitting) admits stationary solutions with

chemical potential µ, written in terms of the polar coordinates:

ψ+ (x, y, t) = e−iµtf1(ρ), ψ− (x, y, t) = e−iµt+iθρf2(ρ),

(31)

12

where real functions f1,2 (ρ) take ﬁnite values and have zero derivatives at ρ = 0, and feature the following asymptotic
form at ρ → ∞:

f1 ≈ F ρ−1/2e−√−2µ−λ2ρ cos (λr + δ) , f2 ≈ −F r−3/2e−√−2µ−λ2ρ sin (λr + δ) ,

with constants F and δ. As it follows from Eq. (32), the solutions are exponentially localized, as solitons, at

µ < −λ2/2.

(32)

(33)

(35)

Solutions (31) are built as bound states of a fundamental (zero-vorticity, S+ = 0) soliton in component ψ+ and a
solitary vortex, with vorticity S− = 1, in ψ−, therefore composite modes of this type are called semi-vortices (SVs)
[23]. The invariance of Eq. (1) with respect to transformation

ψ± (r, θ) → ψ∓ (r, π − θ)

(34)

gives rise to a semi-vortex which is a mirror image of (31), with (S+ = 0, S− = 1) replaced by (S+ = −1, S− = 0):

ψ+ (x, y, t) = −e−iµt−iθρf2(ρ), ψ− = e−iµtf1(ρ).

Numerically, stable SVs were generated, as solutions to Eq.

(1) by means of imaginary-time simulations [52],

starting from the Gaussian input,

where A1,2 and α1,2 > 0 are real constants. A typical example of the SV is displayed in Fig. 8(a).

ψ(0)

+ = A1 exp(cid:0)−α1ρ2(cid:1) , ψ(0)

− = A2ρ exp(cid:0)iθ − α2ρ2(cid:1) ,

(36)

Further, Fig. 8(b) represents the family of the SVs, showing their chemical potential as a function of the norm,
cf. Fig. 5(a). Note that the µ(N ) dependence satisﬁes the VK criterion, dµ/dN < 0, which is the above-mentioned
necessary condition for the stability of solitary modes supported by the self-attractive nonlinearity. The family of the
SV solitons exists precisely in the interval of norms (18), which, as said above, should secure their stability against
the critical collapse. It is also worthy to note that there is no ﬁnite minimum (threshold) value of N necessary for the
existence of the SVs in the free space. In the limit of µ → −∞, the vortex component of the SV vanishes, while the
fundamental one degenerates into the usual Townes soliton, with N = N (S=0)
, as shown by means of the dependence
of ratio N+/N on N in Fig. 8(d).

max

Systematic real-time simulations conﬁrm the stability of the whole SV family at η ≤ 1, while they are unstable at
η > 1, where, however, there is another family of stable solitons in the form of mixed modes (MMs), see below. In
fact, the SVs at η ≤ 1 and MMs at η ≥ 1 are the ﬁrst ever found examples of stable solitons supported by the cubic
self-attractive nonlinearity in the free 2D space.
The wave form (36) was used not only as the input for the imaginary-time simulations, but also as an ansatz for

the application of the VA. The substitution of the ansatz into expression (26) for the energy yields

while norm (25) of the ansatz is N = π(cid:2)A2
2(cid:1)(cid:3) . Then, values of amplitudes A1, A2 and inverse
squared widths α1,α2 of the ansatz are predicted by the minimization of E with respect to the variational parameters,
∂Esemi/∂ (A1,2, α1,2) = 0, under the constraint that N is kept constant. Figure 8(c) displays the comparison of the
so predicted amplitude A1 and the maximum value of |ψ+ (x, y)| obtained from the numerical solution at η = 0. It
is seen that the accuracy of the VA is quite reasonable.
Very recently, the study of 2D SV solitons was extended to a system with long-range anisotropic cubic interactions,
mediated by dipole-dipole forces in a bosonic gas composed of atoms carrying magnetic moments [54]. An essentially
novel feature found in the nonlocal model is a new parameter of the family of SV solitons, viz., a spontaneous shift
of the pivot of the vortical component (ψ−) with respect to its zero-vorticity counterpart (ψ+). Those solitons also
demonstrate an essentially diﬀerent mobility scenario from the one outlined below for the present model: they respond
to an applied kick by drift in the opposite direction (with an eﬀective negative mass) along a spiral trajectory.

(37)

2.

2D mixed modes (at Ω = 0)

13

Aside from the SVs, the same SOC system (22) gives rise to another type of vorticity-carrying solitons, in the form
of MMs, which combine terms with zero and unitary vorticities, (S = 0, S = −1) and (S = 0, S = +1), in the spin-
up and spin-down components, ψ+ and ψ−. Numerically, the MM can be produced by imaginary-time simulations
initiated by the following input, which may also serve as the variational ansatz:

ψ(0)
ψ(0)

+ = A1 exp(cid:0)−α1ρ2(cid:1) − A2ρ exp(cid:0)−iθ − α2ρ2(cid:1) ,
− = A1 exp(cid:0)−α1ρ2(cid:1) + A2ρ exp(cid:0)iθ − α2r2(cid:1) .

(38)

In fact, the MM may be considered as a superposition of the SV (31) and its mirror image (35). Accordingly, symmetry
reﬂection (34) transforms the MM into itself.

A typical example of the MM state is displayed in Fig. 9(a). Note that peak positions of the two components,
|ψ+ (x, y) | and |ψ− (x, y)|, in this state are separated along x, Fig. 9(d) showing the separation (DX) as a function
of the norm. For a small amplitude of the vortex component, A2, Eq. (38) yields DX ≈ A2/ (α1A1).
The µ(N ) dependence for the MM family is displayed in Fig. 9(b), which shows that the VK criterion holds in this
case too, and, as well as SVs, the MMs do not have any threshold value of N necessary for their existence. The family
(η) = 2N (S=0)
exists in the interval of N < ˜N (S=0)
is the critical norm (18) corresponding to
the Townes solitons. In the limit of N → ˜N (S=0)
(η) the vortex components vanish in the MM, and it degenerates
into a two-component Townes soliton, cf. the degeneration of the SV in the limit of N → N (S=0)
, which was shown

in Figs. 8(b,d). The separation between peaks of the two components vanishes in this limit too, see Fig. 9(d).

counterpart, cf. Fig. 8(c), but it is usable too.

Direct simulations demonstrate that the MMs are unstable at η < 1, and stable at η ≥ 1, i.e., precisely in the
regions where the SVs are, severally, stable and unstable (exactly at η = 1, both the SV and MM solutions are stable
[49]). This stability switch between the SV and MM is explained by the comparison of energy (26) for them at equal
values of the norm: the energy is smaller for the SV at η < 1, and for the MM at η > 1 [23] (similar to what is shown
below in Fig. 13(a) for the 3D system). Accordingly, the SV and MM realize the system’s stable GS, respectively, at
η < 1 and η > 1, while in the opposite case each soliton species represents an excited state, instead of the GS, being
therefore unstable.

3. Eﬀects of the Zeeman splitting

The above considerations did not include the Zeeman splitting, Ω 6= 0.

In the presence of moderately strong
splitting, with 0 < Ω < λ2, the consideration of Eq. (22), similar to that which produced the asymptotic form (32) of
the SV soliton at Ω = 0, demonstrates that the SVs exist at

cf. existence region (33) at Ω = 0. The asymptotic form of the SV solution, aﬀected by Ω, is more complex than one
given by Eq. (32); namely, the radial decay rate and wavenumber in Eq. (32) are replaced as follows:

µ < −(1/2)(cid:0)λ2 + Ω2/λ2(cid:1) ≡ µmax,

(40)

p−2µ − λ2 →q−µ − λ2 +pµ2 − Ω2, λ → p−2µλ2 − λ4 − Ω2
q−µ − λ2 +pµ2 − Ω2

.

(41)

Strong Zeeman splitting, with Ω > λ2, replaces existence condition (40) by µ < −λ2. In this case, the SV solitons
keep the asymptotic form (41) in the semi-inﬁnite interval (40) of the chemical potentials, while, in the adjacent ﬁnite
interval appearing in this case,

the SV soliton exhibits a more dramatic change of its asymptotic shape: the radial wavenumber vanishes, the decay
of the solution at ρ → ∞ being provided by the following exponential factor,

µmax < µ < −λ2,

(42)

exp"−r2(cid:16)−µ − λ2 −p2µλ2 + λ4 + Ω2(cid:17)ρ#

(43)

(at µ = µmax, see Eq. (40), expression (43) matches Eq. (41)).

As concerns the switch of the stability between the SV and MM at η = 1, which was demonstrated above for Ω = 0,
it is pushed by Ω > 0 to larger values of the relative strength of the cross-attraction, η > 1 [51]. An explicit result
can be obtained in the limit of large Ω, when Eq. (23) demonstrates that the chemical potential is close to −Ω:

The spin-down component, ψ−, is vanishingly small in this limit, hence stationary equation (24) simpliﬁes to

µ = −Ω + δµ,

|δµ| ≪ Ω.

where (Ω − µ) is approximately replaced by 2Ω, pursuant to Eq. (44). Then, the substitution of approximation (45)
into Eq. (23) leads to the following equation for u+:

(δµ) u+ = −

Ω(cid:19)∇2u+ − |u+|2u+ .

By itself, Eq. (46) is tantamount to the stationary version of the 2D NLSE, which gives rise to the Townes solitons
in u+, while Eq. (45) generates a small vortex component of the SV complex in u−. Due to the presence of factor
(1 − 1/Ω) in Eq. (46) and the smallness of 1/Ω, the norm (25) of the corresponding SV complex is

where N (S=0)
is the standard norm of the Townes soliton (18), the last term being a contribution from the small
vortex component given by Eq. (45). Equation (47) demonstrates that the total norm of the SV soliton is (slightly)
smaller than the collapse threshold, N (S=0)
, hence the SV soliton is protected against the collapse, still realizing the
stable GS of the system.

max

The lowest-order approximation presented here does not give rise to terms including the cross-attraction coeﬃcient,
η from Eq. (22), which implies that, in the limit of large Ω, all solitons belong to the SV type, irrespective of the
value of η, in accordance with the above-mentioned fact that the increase of Ω leads to conversion of the MMs into
SVs [51].

4. Mobility of stable 2D solitons

Although the underlying system (22) conserves the momentum (27), the SOC terms break the Galilean invariance
of the original NLSEs. For this reason, generating moving solitons from quiescent ones, which were considered above,
is a nontrivial problem. As shown in Ref. [23], the system gives rise to the mobility of 2D solitons along the y axis,
but not along x. The respective solutions moving at velocity vy can be looked for as

ψ± = exp(cid:18)ivyy −

i
2

v2

yt(cid:19) φ±(x; y′ ≡ y − vyt; t)

(48)

(Eq. (48) produces the Galilean transform of the wave functions ψ± in Galilean-invariant systems). The substitution
of ansatz (48) into Eq. (22) leads to the coupled GPEs in the moving reference frame, which diﬀer from Eqs. (22) by
the presence of linear mixing between the two components (here ∇2 ≡ ∂2/∂x2 + ∂2/∂ (y′)2, and Ω = 0 is set):

(49)

The same linear mixing can be imposed onto the 2D settings by a GHz wave coupling the two underlying atomic
states [55], hence the linear mixing by itself represents a relevant addition to the model.

Stationary solutions to equations (49), written in the moving reference frame, can be obtained, as well as in the case
of Eqs. (22), by means of the imaginary-time evolution method. In particular, at η = 2, when the GS is represented
by the quiescent MM soliton, its moving version, which is displayed in Figs. 8(a,b) for N = 3.1 and vy = 0.5, exists
and is stable too. As well as its quiescent counterpart, this mode features the mirror symmetry between the proﬁles of
|φ+ (x, y)| and |φ− (x, y)|. Figures 10(a,b) display a typical example of a stable moving MM, and Fig. 10(c) shows the
amplitude of the moving soliton, A =p|φ+(x = 0, y = 0)|2 + |φ−(x = 0, y = 0)|2, as a function of vy. The amplitude
monotonously decreases with the growth of the velocity, vanishing at

max ≈ 1.8,
i.e., the mobile solitons exist in the limited interval of the velocities.

vy = (vy)(MM)

(50)

The SV solitons may also be made mobile, but in a very narrow interval of velocities – e.g., at vy < (vy)(SV)

max ≈ 0.03
for η = 0, λ = 1, Ω = 0, and N = 3.7. At vy > 0.03, the imaginary-time solution of Eq. (49) with the SV input
converges to stable MM solitons, instead of the SV.

C.

3D metastable solitons

1. Analytical considerations

The creation of metastable 3D solitons in the model based on Eq. (29) can be predicted starting from scaling
evaluation of diﬀerent terms in the respective energy functional (30). Assuming that a localized state has characteristic

Although this minimum cannot represent the GS, which formally corresponds to Etot → −∞ at L → 0 in the collapsed
state, as is suggested by Fig. 11 too – in fact, this means that the system has no true GS), it corresponds to a self-
trapped state which is stable against small perturbations. Condition (52) suggests that the metastable 3D solitons
may exist when the SOC term is present, while its strength λ is not too large, N and η being not too large either.

More accurate semi-analytical results can be obtained by means of the VA, which is based on the following ansatz

for the 3D version of the SV mode, written in cylindrical coordinates (ρ, z, θ), cf. its 2D counterpart (36):

(51)

(52)

(53)

(54)

{ψ+, ψ−} = e−iµt(cid:8)f1(ρ, z), eiθ f2(ρ, z)(cid:9) ,

fn = in−1 (An + iBnz) ρn−1 exp(cid:0)−αnρ2 − βnz2(cid:1) (n = 1, 2) ,

with real parameters An, Bn, and αn > 0, βn > 0. In particular, amplitudes An and Bn account for possibility of
having even and odd terms in the dependence of the wave functions of the vertical coordinate, z. Further, the ansatz
for the 3D version of the MM soliton may be chosen as a superposition, with mixing angle ζ, of the SV (53) and its
ﬂipped counterpart, cf. Eq. (35) in the 2D setting:

ψ+ = (cos ζ) f1(ρ, z) − (sin ζ) f ∗
ψ− = (sin ζ) f ∗

2 (ρ, z) e−iφ ,
1 (ρ, z) + (cos ζ) f2(ρ, z) eiφ .

(55)

The substitution of ans¨atze (53)-(55) into the full energy (30) and minimizing it with respect to the free parameters
under the constraint of the ﬁxed total norm produces results summarized in Fig. 12, in which (meta)stable 3D solitons
are predicted to exist in the shaded areas. It is seen that the solitons indeed exist, provided that λ, N and η are not
too large, in agreement with the rough prediction of Eq. (52). In other words, for ﬁxed λ and η the stable 3D solitons
exist in a ﬁnite interval of the norm,

which is qualitatively similar to the situation for the single-component model stabilized by the HO trapping potential,
cf. Figs. 1 and 2.

FIG. 12: (Color online) Stable 3D solitons are predicted by the variational approximation in blue shaded regions of the
parameter planes. In panel (a), these are semi-vortices at η < 1, and mixed modes at η > 1, with the boundary between them
depicted by the black solid line. In (b), the stability area is ﬁlled by the solitons of both types, as they have equal energies
at η = 1. The predictions are conﬁrmed by numerical ﬁndings, as indicated by red crosses and black dots, which indicate,
respectively, the absence and presence of stable numerically generated 3D solitons for respective sets of parameters.

As shown in Fig. 13(a), for η < 1 the VA-predicted energy of the SV is lower than that for the MM, and vice versa
for η > 1, similar to what was found in the 2D model (22) with Ω = 0. Furthermore, red squares in Fig. 13(b) depict
the VA prediction for the soliton’s chemical potential, µ, plotted as a function of norm N for λ = 1 and η = 0.3. These
curves clearly demonstrate that, also similar to what was found in the 2D model (cf. Figs. 8(b) and 9(b)), there is
no threshold (minimum norm) necessary for the existence of the stable 3D solitons, which exist up to a N = Nmax,
see Eq. (56).

While the stability of the upper branch is consistent with the VK criterion, dµ/dN < 0, the lower branch in Fig.
13(b), which does not satisfy the VK criterion, represents solitons corresponding to the energy maximum (instead of
the minimum) of the blue dashed curve in Fig. 11, therefore the lower-branch solitons are deﬁnitely unstable. In the
limit of µ → −∞, they carry over into the known unstable 3D solitons of the single GPE [56].

2. Numerical results

18

In the numerical form, stationary 3D solitons were produced by means of imaginary-time simulations of Eq. (29).
Typical examples of the density proﬁles in stable SV and MM solitons are displayed in Fig. 14. Naturally, the MM
states exhibit a more sophisticated proﬁle.

whose fundamental and vortical components, |ψ+| and |ψ−|, are plotted in (a1) and (a2), respectively. (b) A mixed mode for
η = 1.5, with (b1), (b2) displaying |ψ+| and |ψ−|, respectively. In each subplot, diﬀerent colors represent constant-magnitude
surfaces, |ψ± (x, y, z) | = (0.96, 0.4, 0.04) × |ψ±|max.

Symbols in Fig. 12, which indicate the absence and presence of the numerically generated stable solitons, are in
good agreement with the predictions of the VA. Further, blue circles in Fig. 13(b) represent the numerically obtained
soliton’s chemical potential, which is also close to the prediction of the VA. However, the unstable (lower) branch
in Fig. 13(b), predicted by the VA, cannot be produced by the imaginary-time integration. The stability of the
solitons belonging to the upper branch in Fig. 13(b) was veriﬁed by real-time simulations of their perturbed evolution.
Further, similar to what is shown above for the 2D system in Fig. 11, it was found that stable 3D solitons may be
set in motion in a limited interval of velocities, cf. Eq. (50).

Lastly, it was mentioned in Section II that all the higher-order vortex modes, with S ≥ 2, are completely unstable
in the model with the HO trapping potential (see Figs. 3 and 5). Higher-vorticity states of both the SV and MM
types can be found too as stationary solutions of Eqs. (22) [23] and 29 [24], starting from ans¨atze

with s = 1, 2, 3, ..., for the higher-order 2D SV solitons (cf. Eq. (36)), and

for their 3D counterparts, cf. Eq. (53). However, numerical analysis demonstrates that all such higher-order states,
with s ≥ 1, are completely unstable, in the 2D and 3D systems alike.

This article aims to present a brief review of the broad area of 2D and 3D solitons, both fundamental (zero-vorticity)
and vortical ones. The multidimensional solitons and solitary vortices ﬁnd most important physical realizations in

IV. CONCLUSION

19

BEC and nonlinear optics, the most essential problem being the search for physically relevant settings which provide
for the stabilization of this states against the collapse and splitting, that tend to destroy the fundamental and vortical
solitons, respectively, in media with the (most common) cubic self-attractive nonlinearity. The presentation includes
two particular topics, one well-established, viz., the stabilization of the 3D and 2D modes with vorticities S = 0
and 1 in a trapping harmonic-oscillator potential (generally, anisotropic one), and the most recent topic, namely, the
creation of stable 2D and 3D solitons, which mix terms with S = 0 and 1 (semi-vortices) or S = 0 and ±1 (mixed
modes), in a two-component system which realizes the spin-orbit coupling in BEC. In either case, the analysis reveals
a drastic diﬀerence between the 2D and 3D settings. In the former case, the stabilization mechanism creates GSs
(ground states), that were missing without it. The total norm of the GSs takes values below the threshold necessary
for the onset of the critical collapse, driven by the cubic attractive nonlinearity in the 2D space. In the 3D settings,
the supercritical collapse does not allow the creation of a GS, but, nevertheless, an appropriate mechanism may create
metastable solitons, which are robust against small perturbations.

There are many directions for the development of the studies of multidimensional solitons. As concerns the theory,
a completely diﬀerent possibility is the use of spatially nonuniform self-repulsive nonlinearity, with the local strength
growing from the center to periphery at any rate faster than rD, where r is the distance from the center, and D the
spatial dimension. This model makes it possible to create very robust solitons of diverse types, including fundamental
ones and solitary vortices [57, 58], as well as sophisticated 3D states – notably, hopﬁons (vortex tori with inner twist,
which feature two independent topological numbers). A challenging problem is ﬁnding still more general physically
relevant conditions for the creation of complex 3D modes, such as the hopﬁons [60], skyrmions (which, similar to
hopﬁons, carry two diﬀerent topological charges) [61, 62], monopoles [63], linked vortex rings, and others. In terms
of the experiment, the entire area of multidimensional solitons remains a challenging one, as very few experimental
results have been reported, thus far (the latest experimental ﬁndings are the creation of (2+1)D optical spatial solitons
in media with competing focusing-defocusing cubic-quintic [64] and quintic-septimal [65] nonlinearities, as well as the
making of a quasi-stable vortex solitons in an optical medium where nonlinear losses are essential [66]).
