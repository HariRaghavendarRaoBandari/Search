Abstract

Positive and negative ions forming so-called pair plasma diﬀering in sign of their charge but

asymmetric in mass and temperature support a new acoustic mode where damping of heavier ion

dominates. The condition for the excitation of ion sound wave through electron beam induced

Cherenkov instability is also investigated. This beam can generate a perturbation in the pair ion

plasmas in the presence of electrons when there is number density, temperature and mass diﬀerence

in the two species of ions. Basic emphasis is on the focusing of ion sound waves and we show how,

in the area of localization of wave energy, the density of pair particles increases while electrons are

pushed away from that region. Further, this localization of wave is dependent on the shape of the

pulse. Considering the example of pancake and bullet shaped pulses, we ﬁnd that only the former

leads to compression of pair ions in the supersonic regime of the focusing region. Here possible

existence of regions where pure pair particles can exist may also be speculated which is not only

useful from academic point of view but also to mimic the situation of plasma (electro positron

asymmetric and symmetric ) observed in astrophysical environment.

INTRODUCTION

Pair (pi) plasmas consisting of only positive and negative ions, produced in laboratory,

have received considerate[1–11] attention for the reason that such plasmas have allowed

the investigation of many classic problems of physics by opening a door for the scientists

curious to understand the phenomena occurring hundred of light years away in the astro-

physical environment, this motivates us to address this an advancement in the ”laboratory

astrophysics”.

Electron and positron (pair) plasmas have been intensively studied in the preceding

decades. The latter are found in some interstellar compact objects (e.g., in neutron stars,

in the interior of Jupiter, in active galactic nuclei (AGN), etc.), near the polar cusp regions

of the pulsars and neutron star atmospheres, in the inner region of the accretion disks sur-

rounding the central black hole, in quasar atmospheres, and in the Van Allen radiation belts

etc. [12–18]. It is also known that the early prestellar period of the evolution of the Universe

was presumably dominated by relativistic electrons and positrons [19].

In the lepton epoch, which occurred 10−6 < t < 10 sec after the Big Bang, temperatures

reached the values of 109 < T < 1013 K causing annihilation of the nucleon-antinucleon

pairs resulting in matter composed of the electrons, positrons, and photons in thermody-

namic equilibrium [19]. Unlike ordinary plasmas with signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the

masses of chased particles, pair plasmas on the other hand keep a time-space parity because

the mobility of the particles in electromagnetic ﬁelds is the same. Thus the symmetry col-

lapses the scales which disentangle short and long wavelengths. Positrons have been focused

in connection with antimatter property, e.g., CPT (charge, parity and time reversal) invari-

ance, in high- energy physics and astrophysics. Both the relativistic and non-relativistic pair

plasmas have been gradually explored to represent a new state of matter with unique ther-

modynamic properties drastically diﬀerent from ordinary electron-ion plasmas. For these

reasons it’s very challenging to produce a pair plasma in the laboratory. However, successful

creation of suﬃciently dense pair plasma made of fullerene ions C 60

− is indeed a
triumph of experimental science, Oohara and Hatakeyama[1, 2] have intrigued the scientiﬁc

+ and C 60

community. This is because in such plasmas we do not encounter with the annihilation

problem which arises (at much longer characteristic time scales compared to the collective

interaction time) due to interaction of matter (e.g., electrons) and anti-matter (positrons)

2

and so provide a controlled environment to study the underlying physics. A basic require-

ment for long time scale experiments will be that the pair annihilation time scale is many

orders of magnitude larger than the plasma period. However, the disagreement between

experimental observations and basic ﬂuid theory is yet to be resolved and has divided the

concerned scientiﬁc community.

Pair plasmas have been dealt with two diﬀerent ways: One is recognized as a ”symmetric”

system where pair particles have the same charge, mass, temperature, density etc., whereas

in second way of treatment, the symmetry of the pair plasma is mildly broken and the

system is usually knows as ”asymmetric” plasma.

This asymmetry, however, brings forth new physics frontiers, as is of interest as such

plasmas can be produced in the laboratory. Whereas some nonlinear phenomena which

emerge naturally during the evolution of pair particles may usually cause this asymmetric

behavior in the experiments.

In Japan, Hatekayama and Oohara [20, 21] succeeded in creating lighter pair plasma with

hydrogen; however, eﬀorts are being made to accomplish its improved quality. In parallel,

for the theoreticians it’s a challenge to explain some of the results and some attempts have

been made with kinetic theory taking into account the boundary eﬀects [7].

Several authors [6–9] have theoretically investigated the linear and nonlinear behavior of

pi plasmas after the above mentioned works. However a few authors have expressed their

doubts on the observations and explanations of the experiment discussed in Ref. 2.

For example looking at the results presented by Oohara et al., [1, 2], some authors pointed

out that the produced pair-ion fullerene plasmas seem to contain electrons as well for the ion

acoustic wave observed in experiment cannot be observed in a pure a pair ion plasma at the

same temperature [6]. Later on, criteria to deﬁne pure pair ion plasma was also presented

by Saleem (2007)[4].

Saleem et al.,[4] deﬁned a theoretical limit to distinguish between a pure pi plasma and

the one with additional species of electrons. It is the limit on the ratio of electron density to

positive ion number density. It has been shown [4] that the electrons are not fully ﬁltered out

and the observation of one of the linear modes proves their presence in the system and the

authors have also shown that increase in the concentration of electrons in pair-ion plasmas

aﬀects the speed of ion acoustic wave (IAW) corresponding to the same electron temperature.

Verheest et al.

[5] demonstrated that a strict symmetry destroys the stationary nonlinear

3

structures of acoustic nature and showed such nonlinear structures can exist when there is

a thermodynamic asymmetry between both constituents.

Observing the dispersion properties in fullerene pair plasma experiments, Verheest et

al., emphasized that there seem to exist an acoustic wave rather than linear electrostatic

waves interpreted by the Ohara et al. [2] which emphasizes symmetry breaking. This is also

consistent with the experimental conditions pointing to small asymmetries.

In this manuscript, we aim to investigate linear longitudinal mode for asymmetric pair

plasma and with an additional concentration of electrons. We note that not only asymmetry

leads to a new longitudinal mode but also the addition of electrons is useful in studying the

pure pair ions. Nonetheless we discuss few cases with and without concentration of electrons.

The organization of the paper is as follows: In Sec. II, we discuss the dispersion relation

for diﬀerent cases. In Sec. III, Cherenokov instability, and the condition for the excitation of

the ion sound wave is studied. Sec. V devotes to the derivation of Zakharov equations with

and without concentration of electrons. The discussion of the compression phenomenon and

the possibility of formation of pair plasma is presented in Sec. VI. The main ﬁndings of the

paper are recapitulated in Sec. VII.

II. LONGITUDINAL WAVE

It has been reported by [1, 2] that a pure pair-ion plasma can support three kinds of

electrostatic ion waves in diﬀerent frequency regimes propagating parallel to the external
static magnetic ﬁeld. Where the ion acoustic speed has been deﬁned as cs = mi
where
Ti
mi = m+ = m− and Ti = T+ = T− have been assumed. The subscripts plus and minus
denote the singly charged positive and negative ions. This is also recognized as the case of

a symmetric pair ion plasma. However it was pointed out by Saleem et al.

[5] that cs is

the frequency of the ion thermal wave and that the measured frequency of the ion acoustic

wave is much larger than the theoretical value ω = csk. And that the larger value of the

ion acoustic frequency presented in Fig. 2 of Ref.[2] indicated the presence of electrons in

signiﬁcant concentration. Also as described in the introduction, some authors claim that

symmetry will be broken in such plasmas which, however is point of our interest. For this

let’s start our analysis for the spectrum of linear wave associated with the pair plasma, for

that we ﬁrst write Poisson’s equation for all species:

ǫk2φ = −e(ne + Z−ni− − Z+ni+)

(1)

where Z± is the charge on positive and negative ions respectively and nα0 is the number
density with α = e (electrons), i+ (positive ions) and i− (negative ions). The equilibrium
quantities will be written with substript ”0”.

For the longitudinal electrostatic perturbations

could have diﬀerent thermal speeds temperatures. One could also arrange experiments with

diﬀerent setups for diﬀerent species when, for instance, there are fractions of heavier or

lighter ions or there is a mixture of diﬀerent mass or temperature species with opposite

charges. Below we discuss dispersion of the waves for diﬀerent cases.

damping rate is exponential and is very important when T+ >> T−. The second term in

Eq. (9) is much larger than one, with exponent must be around one or less. From here it

follows when T+ >> T−, the second term of (9) dominates and we have a new longitudinal

mode.

The spectrum (8) and the damping rate (11), we call them the ion sound waves owing to

their striking similarity with the ion acoustic waves in an ordinary electron-ion plasma.

III. CHERENKOV INSTABILITY

In this section we investigate a situation when a charged particle beam consisting of elec-

trons interacts with a pair ion plasma. This situation is widely used in practical application,

is a plasma with a small group of electrons of suﬃciently high velocity moving through

a medium of ”resting” particles. The beam density is assumed smaller than that of the

plasma.

We begin our analysis of the plasma-beam system with a straight mono energetic electron

beam having a Maxwellian distribution with non relativistic temperature in the intrinsic

frame of its electrons penetrating a cold Maxwellian distributed plasma, however in the

laboratory frame.

It is to be noted that this model is limited to the fast processes with

characteristic velocities greatly exceeding the thermal velocities of the beam and plasma

particles which, consistently, may be completely ignored.

For this the charge neutrality condition alters as: Z+n0i+ ≃ n0e + Z−n0i− + nB0, here nB0,
here nB represents the beam number density. From now on all quantities with a subscript

”B” will represent the beam electrons. For this case, we obtain the following dispersion

relation:

ǫ(ω, k) =

The last term of this dispersion equation is the contribution of the electron beam, which
has a second order pole at ω ≃ kv0. When this equality is satisﬁed, the ”Cherenkov
resonance” takes place. Resonance width is determined by the factor
(ω−k·v0). For a hydro-
dynamic instability, the spread in velocities in the beam is much smaller than the resonance

just width. So either all beam particles contribute coherently to the instability, or none of

them do.

The growth rate (18) describes the hydrodynamic instability in the long wavelength limit.

For a kinetic instability, the spread in velocities in the beam is much larger than the res-

onance width. So only a certain fraction of particles having speeds near ω/k will contribute

to the instability (will be in resonance with the plasma wave). A phenomenon like Landau

damping falls in this class, only it is not normally seen as an instability since it damps the

wave rather than driving it.

Further, we consider the frequency range vte > ω/k > vt+,− for the case of hot electron

beam, i.e.,|(ω − kv0)| ≪ kvtB is satisﬁed. In this case, the dispersion Eq. (14) gives:

IV. EXCITATION OF ION-ACOUSTIC WAVE

One of the most prominent models in plasma physics is described by the Zakharov

equations[22, 23], in which high frequency Langmuir waves are coupled nonlinearly to low

frequency ion-acoustic waves. In order to discuss the nonlinear eﬀects in the pair plasma in

the hydrodynamic approximation, we derive Zakharovs equation for both cases such as with

and without electrons. In our consideration, we suppose that high frequency waves are the

ion sound waves, it is important to understand that when the sound wave interacts with the

plasma, it will strongly perturb the density of the plasma. This perturbation is due to the

nonlinearity of the equations. Such interactions lead to an average force which is called the

ponderomotive force.

where A is the vector potential of the sound wave and it can be written as A =
A0(r, t) exp[i(k0 · r − ω0t), here A0(r, t) is the amplitude of the vector potential of the sound
wave and it varies slowly with time.

Using (25) along with quasi neutrality equation, we obtain

V. SELF FOCUSING

Up to now we have discussed in Sec (II), the spectrum of ion sound wave for diﬀerent

cases. Now with the aid of Zakharov equation (32), we analyze subsonic and supersonic cases

for the localization of the ion sound wave that will help us understand how the compression

of pair ions takes place in the localized area of ion sound wave.

Subsonic Case:

First we suppose that the subsonic case for that ∂2

We now assume that the ion acoustic wave propagates along z-axis and introduce r⊥ and

τ = t − z/vg as new variables, then Eq.(34) becomes

If we choose the boundary condition such that |Upond(e)| = 0 then the Eq. (35) gives
C1 = C2 = 0. In order to ﬁnd the diﬀerent feature of Eq. (35), we suppose that |Ψ(r⊥, τ )|2
has the following proﬁle

U 2
pond(e) = a2

0 exp[−r2/2R2]{Θ(τ − τ1) − Θ(τ − τ2)},

(36)

where R is the pulse width, τ2 − τ1 = τ0 is the pulse length and Θ(x) is a unit step
function with properties Θ(x) = 0 for x < 0 and Θ(x) = 1 for x > 0. Substituting (36) in

(35) gives

For the case r⊥ = 0, and τ − τ1 = τ0, then |Upond(e)(0, τ )|2 = a2

Using above expression, we discuss two cases when the ion sound wave is focused. First

when the wave has a bullet like initial proﬁle i.e. vgτ0 > R, we get

which means in the focusing region density of the electrons decreases (δne < 0) and for

the depletion of electrons there only pair particles (positive and negative ions) are left. This

is in particularly important for us because as stated in the introduction the presence of

electrons (may be in small concentration) is inevitable; however, if we wish to study how

the pure pair plasmas are going to behave then this investigation is very useful.

One the other hand when the pulse shape is pancake (δne > 0) hence there exists a regime

of interaction of the wave packet, where electrons can assemble together in the focusing region

of the wave packet.

However, for a two component pure pair plasma, we can see the force which acts on the

negative ions, for that Zakharov equation (28) follows

. There have introduced up as the characteristic

Hence at u2

0 > u2

p the leading half of the pulse pushes the particles (negative ions) forwards

and due to the smallness v− << up, the pulse overlaps this gathering of the particles. The

back half of the pulse breaks the particles and therefore in the region of the pulse location

we have an increase of the density.

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this manuscript, we have found a new mode, namely, the acoustic mode, in pure pair

plasma both with and without the the presence of electrons. Here diﬀerence in temperature

and mass of the ions is very important and we note that damping of heavier ions with

less temperature contributes signiﬁcantly to the acoustic mode. Ion sound waves have been

excited by the monoenergetic electron beam of small density, and the Cherenkov instability

13

condition for the beam particles has been found in both the hydrodynamic and kinetic limits.

After interaction with plasma, the ions sound mode has been shown to generate ion acoustic

type waves.

We have shown that in our case the ion sound wave can be focused and that the pair ions

cluster in the focus region. We have also shown that when the ion sound wave pulse has the

form of a light bullet, the pair ions density increases in the focusing region of the EM wave,

while the opposite happens when the wave pulse has a pancake shape. In future, we plan to

investigate the modulation instability and both stationary and non stationary solutions The

present results may have importance in both laboratory and astrophysical plasmas where

there is a possibility of ions with diﬀerent mass and temperatures.
