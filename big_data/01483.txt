Abstract

The present work is a continuation of the previous papers written
by the author on the subject.
In terms of the measurability (or
measurable quantities) notion introduced in a minimal length theory,
ﬁrst the consideration is given to a quantum theory in the momentum
representation. The same terms are used to consider the Markov
gravity model that here illustrates the general approach to studies of
gravity in terms of measurable quantities.
This paper is dedicated to the 75th Anniversary of Professor Vladimir
Grigor’evich Baryshevsky.

Introduction: Measurable and Nonmea-
surable Quantities

This work is a direct continuation of my previous papers [1, 2] and is inter-
laced with these publications at some points. As shown in [1], provided the
theory involves the minimal length lmin as a minimal measurement unit for
the quantities having the dimensions of length, this theory must not have
inﬁnitesimal spatial-temporal quantities dxµ because the latter lead to the
inﬁnitely small length ds [3]

that is inexistent because of lmin.

Of course, in this case only measurable quantities are meant. As a math-
ematical notion, the quantity ds is naturally existent but, due to the involve-
ment of lmin, it is immeasurable.

However it is well known that at high energies (on the order of the
quantum gravity energies) the minimal length lmin to which the indicated
energies are “sensitive”, as distinct from the low ones, should inevitably be-
come apparent in the theory. But if lmin is really present, it must be present
at all the “Energy Levels” of the theory, low energies including. And this, in
addition to the above arguments, points to the fact that the mathematical
formalism of the theory should not involve any inﬁnitesimal spatial-temporal
quantities. Besides, some new parameters become involved, which are de-
pendent on lmin [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].

What are the parameters of interest in the case under study? It is
obvious that, as the quantum-gravitational eﬀects will be revealed at very
small (possibly Planck) scales, these parameters should be dependent on
some limiting values, e.g., lP ∝ lmin and hence Planck energy EP .
This means that in a high-energy gravitation theory the energy-dependent
or, what is the same, measuring scales-dependent parameters should be nec-
essarily introduced.

But, on the other hand, these parameters could hardly disappear totally
at low energies, i.e., for General Relativity (GR) too. However, since the
well-known canonical (and in essence the classical) statement of GR has
no such parameters [3], the inference is as follows: their inﬂuence at low
energies is so small that it may be disregarded at the modern stage in
evolution of the theory and of the experiment.

Still this does not imply that they should be ignored in future evolution

of the theory, especially on going to its high-energy limit.

But at the present time, the mathematical apparatus of both special
and general relativity theories (and of a quantum theory as well) is based
on the concept of continuity and on analysis of inﬁnitesimal spatial-temporal
quantities. This is a corner stone for the Minkowski space geometry (MS)
and also for the Riemannian geometry (RG) [3].

However, this approach involves a problem when we proceed to a quan-
tum description of nature. Even at a level of the heuristic understanding, it

2

is clear that, as measuring procedures in a quantum theory are fundamen-
tal, the description with the use of inﬁnitesimal quantities is problematic
because in its character the measuring procedure is discrete.

At a level of the mathematical formalism and physical principles, incom-
patibility of both the Minkowski space geometry and Riemannian geometry
with the uncertainty principle is expected in any “format”, in relativistic
and nonrelativistic cases. This problem is considered in greater detail in
the following sections of this work.

Thus, if the matter concerns the measurable quantities only, the Quan-
tum Theory (QT) and Gravity formalism should be changed: at least, a
new formalism should not involve the inﬁnitesimal spatial-temporal quan-
tities dxµ. Naturally, because of the involved lmin (initially assuming that
lmin ∝ lP ) new theories should involve new parameters associated with lmin.
Presently, such parameters are inexplicitly involved (for example, E/EP in
a quantum gravity phenomenology [4]).

But there is no need to discard the modern formalism of QT and Gravity,
since it is clear that at low energies it oﬀers an excellent approximation,
experimentally supported to a high accuracy (see [5]). However, proceeding
from the above, a change-over to high energies is impossible as, by author’s
opinion, this formalism is used in an eﬀort to combine uncombinable things.
This work makes the arguments of [1, 2] more forcible on the one hand,
and presents a study of the additional parameters associated with the in-
volvement of lmin , in terms of which one can develop a new formalism for a
quantum theory and for gravity at all the scales energies too, on the other
hand.

One of the key problems of the modern fundamental physics (Quan-
tum Theory (QT) and Gravity (GR)) is framing of a correct theory associ-
ated with the ultraviolet region, i.e., the region of the highest (apparently
Planck) energies approaching those of the Big Bang.

However, it is well known that at high energies (on the order of the
quantum gravity energies) the minimal length lmin to which the indicated
energies are “sensitive”, as distinct from the low ones, should inevitably
become apparent in the theory. But if lmin is really present, it must be
present at all the “Energy Levels” of the theory, low energies including.

What follows from the existence of the minimal length lmin? When the

3

minimal length is involved, any nonzero measurable quantity having the
dimensions of length should be a multiple of lmin. Otherwise, its measure-
ment with the use of lmin would result in the measurable quantity ς, so that
ς < lmin, and this is impossible.

This suggests that the spatial-temporal quantities dxµ are nonmeasur-
able quantities because the latter lead to the inﬁnitely small nonmeasurable
quantity length ds Equation (1).

Of course, as a mathematical notion, the quantities dxµ, ds are naturally
existent but one should realize that there is no way to express them in terms
of the minimal possible measuring unit lmin.

So, trying to frame a theory (QT and GR) correct at all the energy
levels using only the measurable quantities, one should realize that then the
mathematical formalism of the theory should not involve any inﬁnitesimal
spatial-temporal quantities. Besides, proceeding from the acknowledged
results associated with the Planck scales physics [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13], one can infer that certain new parameters dependent on lmin should be
involved.

What are the parameters of interest in the case under study? It is
obvious that, as the quantum-gravitational eﬀects will be revealed at very
small (possibly Planck) scales, these parameters should be dependent on
some limiting values, e.g., lP ∝ lmin and hence Planck’s energy EP .
This means that in high-energy QT and GR the energy-or, what is the
same, measuring scales-dependent parameters should be necessarily intro-
duced.

But, on the other hand, these parameters could hardly disappear totally

at low energies both in QT and in GR.

But, provided lmin exists, it must be involved at all the energy levels,

both high and low.

The fact that lmin is omitted in the formulation of low-energy QT and

GR and the theories give perfect results leads to two diﬀerent inferences:

1. The inﬂuence of the above-mentioned new parameters associated with
lmin in low-energy QT and GR is so small that it may be disregarded at the
modern stage in evolution of the theory and of the experiment.

4

2. The modern mathematical apparatus of conventional QT and GR has
been derived in terms of the inﬁnitesimal spatial-temporal quantities dxµ
which, as noted above, are nonmeasurable quantities in the formalism of
lmin.

2 Main Motivation

In this Section the principal assumptions are introduced which have been
implicitly used previously in [1] and especially in [2].

It is well known that in a quantum study the key role is played by
the measuring procedure, its fundamental principle being the Heisenberg
Uncertainty Principle (HUP) [14, 15]:

Now we can proceed to the following quite natural suppositions.

dinate xµ of the arbitrary point xµ, µ = 1, ..., 3 in some space-time system

Here HUP is given for the nonrelativistic case. In the relativistic case
HUP has the distinctive features [16] which, however, are of no signiﬁcance
for the general formulation of Supposition 1, being associated only with par-
ticular alterations in the right-hand side of the second relation Equation (3)

It is clear that at low energies E ≪ EP (momentums P ≪ Ppl) Sup-
position 1 sets a lower bound for the variations (increments) e∆xµ of any

At high energies E (momentums P ) this is not the case if E (P ) have no
upper limit. But, according to the modern knowledge, E (P ) are bounded
by some maximal quantities Emax, (Pmax)

where in general Emax, Pmax may be on the order of Planck quantities

In any case the quantities Pmax and Emax lead to the introduction of the

With this point of view, even at the ultimate (Planck) energies a min-
imal “detected” (i.e., measurable) space-time volume is, within the known
constants, restricted to

Because of this, it is natural to complete Supposition 1 with Supposition

Supposition 2. There is the minimal length lmin as a minimal measure-
ment unit for all quantities having the dimension of length, whereas the
minimal time tmin = lmin/c as a minimal measurement unit for all quanti-
ties having the dimension of time, where c is the speed of light.

lmin and tmin are naturally introduced as ∆xµ, µ = 1, 2, 3 and ∆t in

Equations (3) and (4) for ∆pµ = Pmax and ∆E = Emax.

For deﬁniteness, we consider that Emax and Pmax are the quantities on
the order of the Planck quantities, then lmin and tmin are also on the order
of Planck quantities lmin ∝ lP , tmin ∝ tP .
physical principles with which these suppositions are inconsistent.

Suppositions 1 and 2 are quite natural in the sense that there are no

3 Minimal Length and Measurability

In this Section particularly the results from Subsection 3.1 of [2] are used.
Now from the start we assume that the theory involves the minimal length
lmin as a minimal measurement unit for all quantities having the dimension
of length.

Then it is convenient to begin our study not with HUP Equation (2)
but with its widely known high-energy generalization—the Generalized
Uncertainty Principle (GUP) that naturally leads to the minimal length
lmin [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]:

(9)

Here α′ is the model-dependent dimensionless numerical factor and lP

is the Planckian length.
Note also that initially GUP Equation (9) was derived within a string theory
[17, 18, 19, 20] and, subsequently, in a series of works far from this theory
[21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27] it has been demonstrated that on going to high
(Planck) energies in the right-hand side of HUP Equation (2) an additional
△p
“high-energy” term ∝ l2
 appears. Of particular interest is the work [21],
where by means of a simple gedanken experiment it has been demonstrated
that with regard to the gravitational interaction Equation (9) is the case.
minimal length lmin = ξlP = 2√α′lP .

As Equation (9) is a quadratic inequality, then it naturally leads to the

P

This means that the theory for the quantities with a particular dimension
has a minimal measurement unit. At least, all the quantities with such a

7

dimension should be “quantized”, i.e., be measured by an integer number
of these minimal units of measurement.

Speciﬁcally, if lmin—minimal unit of length, then for any length L we

have the “Integrality Condition” (IC)

L = NLlmin,

(10)

where NL > 0 is an integer number.

What are the consequences for GUP Equation (9) and HUP Equa-

tion (2)?

Assuming that HUP is to a high accuracy derived from GUP on going
to low energies or that HUP is a special case of GUP at low values of the
momentum, we have

(GUP, ∆p → 0) = (HUP ).

(11)

By the language of NL from Equations (10) and (11) is nothing else but

a change-over to the following:

(N∆x ≈ 1) → (N∆x ≫ 1).

(12)

The assumed equalities in Equations (2) and (9) may be conveniently
rewritten in terms of lmin with the use of the deformation parameter αa.
This parameter has been introduced earlier in the papers [30, 31, 32, 33, 34,
35, 36, 37] as a deformation parameter on going from the canonical quantum
mechanics to the quantum mechanics at Planck’s scales (early Universe)
that is considered to be the quantum mechanics with the minimal length
(QMML):

αa = l2

min/a2,

(13)

where a is the measuring scale.

Deﬁnition 1
Deformation is understood as an extension of a particular theory by inclu-
sion of one or several additional parameters in such a way that the initial
theory appears in the limiting transition [38].

Then with the equality (∆p∆x = ) Equation (9) is of the form

∆x =

(17)

From Equations (15)–(17) it is clear that HUP Equation (2) in the case of
the equality appears to a high accuracy in the limit N∆x ≫ 1 in conformity
with Equation (12).
It is easily seen that the parameter αa from Equation (13) is discrete as

it is nothing else but

(18)

At the same time, from Equation (18) it is evident that αa is irregularly

discrete.

constant

we have

α∆x = (∆p)2.

(19)

(20)

But all the above computations are associated with the nonrelativistic
case. As known, in the relativistic case, when the total energy of a particle
with the mass m and with the momentum p equals [39]:

E =pp2c2 + m2c4,

9

(21)

a minimal value for ∆x takes the form [16]:

∆x ≈

And in the ultrarelativistic case

this means simply that

E ≈ pc

(22)

(23)

(24)

Provided the minimal length lmin is involved and considering the “Inte-
grality Condition” (IC) Equation (10), in the general case for Equation (22)
at the energies considerably lower than the Planck energies E ≪ EP we ob-
tain the following:

∆x = N∆xlmin ≈

Similarly, at the same energy scale in the ultrarelativistic case we have

unit of time

tmin = lmin/vmax = lmin/c.

(27)

Then the foregoing Equations (2)–(16) are rewritten by substitution as

follows:

∆x → ∆t; ∆p → ∆E; lmin → tmin; NL → Nt=L/c

Speciﬁcally, Equation (16) takes the form

(N∆t −

)tmin =

10

(28)

(29)

And similar to Equation (10), we get the “Integrality Condition” (IC)

for any time t:

for certain an integer |Nt| ≥ 0.

According to Equation (29), let us deﬁne the corresponding energy E

t ≡ t(Nt) = Nttmin,

(30)

E ≡ E(Nt) =



|Nt − 1

4Nt|tmin

.

(31)

Note that at low energies E ≪ EP , that is for |Nt| ≫ 1, the formula

Equation (31) naturally takes the following form:

E ≡ E(Nt) =



|Nt|tmin

(32)

(1) Let us deﬁne the quantity having the dimensions of length L or time
t measurable, when it satisﬁes the relation Equation (10) (and respectively
Equation (30)).
(2)Let us deﬁne any physical quantity measurable, when its value is consis-
tent with points (1) of this Deﬁnition.

Thus, inﬁnitesimal changes in length (and hence in time) are impossible
(to that indicated in Section 1) and any such changes are dependent on the
existing energies.

In particular, a minimal possible measurable change of length is lmin.
It corresponds to some maximal value of the energy Emax or momentum
Pmax, If lmin ∝ lP , then Emax ∝ EP ,Pmax ∝ PP l, where Pmax ∝ PP l,
where PP l is where the Planck momentum. Then denoting in nonrelativistic
case with △p(w) a minimal measurable change every spatial coordinate w
corresponding to the energy E we obtain

△Pmax(w) = △Emax(w) = lmin.

(33)

Evidently, for lower energies (momentums) the corresponding values of
△p(w) are higher and, as the quantities having the dimensions of length are
quantized Equation (10), for p ≡ p(Np) < pmax, △p(w) is transformed to

|△p(Np)(w)| = |Np|lmin.

(34)

where |Np| > 1 is an integer number so that we have

(35)

In the relativistic case the Equation (33) holds, whereas Equations (34)

and (35) for E ≡ E(NE) < Emax are replaced by
|△E(NE)(w)| = |NE|lmin,

(36)

where |NE| > 1 is an integer.

Next we assume that at high energies E ∝ EP there is a possibility only

Remark 1.

1.1.
It should be noted that the lattice is usually understood as a uni-
form discrete structure with one and the same constant parameter a (lattice
pitch). But in this case we have a nonuniform discrete structure (lattice in
its nature), where the analogous parameter is variable, is a multiple of lmin,
i.e., a = Nalmin, and also is dependent on the energies. Only in the limit
of high (Planck’s) energies we get a (nearly) uniform lattice with (nearly)
constant pitch a ≈ lmin or a = κlmin where κ is on the order of 1.
1.2. Obviously, when lmin is involved, the foregoing formulas for the mo-
menta p(Np) and for the energies E(NE), E(Nt) may certainly give the
highly accurate result that is close to the experimental one only at the veri-
ﬁed low energies: |Np| ≫ 1,|NE| ≫ 1,|Nt| ≫ 1. In the case of high energies
E ∝ Emax ∝ EP or, what is the same |Np| → 1,|NE| → 1,|Nt| → 1, we
have a certain, experimentally unveriﬁed, model with a correct low-energy
limit.

1.3. It should be noted that dispersion relations Equation (21) are valid

13

only at low energies E ≪ EP . In the last few years in a series of works
[40, 41, 42, 43, 44] it has been demonstrated that within the scope of GUP
the high-energy generalization of Equation (21)—Modiﬁed Dispersion Re-
lations (MDRs)—is valid.

Speciﬁcally, in its most general form the Modiﬁed Dispersion Relation

(Formula (9) in [44]) may be given as follows:

p2 = f (E, m; lp) ≃ E2 − µ2 + α1lpE3 + α2l2

(46)

pE4 + O(cid:0)l3

pE5(cid:1) ,

where in the notation of [44] the fundamental constants are c =  = kB = 1,
f is the function that gives the exact dispersion relation, and in the right-
hand side the applicability of the Taylor-series expansion for E ≪ 1/lP is
assumed. The coeﬃcients αi can take diﬀerent values in diﬀerent quantum-
gravity proposals. m is the rest energy of a particle, and the mass parameter
µ in the right-hand side is directly related to the rest energy but µ 6= m if
not all the coeﬃcients αi are vanishing.
The general case of (MDRs) Equation (46) in terms of the considerations
given in this section is yet beyond the scope of this paper and necessitates
further studies of the transition from low E ≪ EP to high E ≈ EP energies.
For now it is assumed that at low energies Equation (21) is valid to
within a high accuracy, whereas at high energies, i.e., for |Np| → 1,|NE| →
1,|Nt| → 1, Equation (21) should be replaced by Equation (46). Besides,
it is important that in this paper, as distinct from [40, 41, 42, 43, 44], the
author uses the simplest (earlier) variant of GUP [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23,
24, 25, 26, 27], involving a minimal length but not a minimal momentum.
Also note that references [40, 41, 42, 43, 44] give not nearly so complete
a list of the publications devoted to GUP (and, in particular, MDR)—a
very complete and interesting survey may be found in [41].

1.4. The papers [1, 2] point to the fact that the resolved discrete the-
ory is very close to the initial continuous one (lmin = 0) at low energies
E ≪ EP , i.e., at |Np| ≫ 1,|NE| ≫ 1.
In what follows all the considerations are given in terms of “measurable
quantities” in the sense of Deﬁnition 2 given in this Section. Speciﬁcally, in
Section 5 these terms are used to consider the Momentum Representation

14

for a quantum theory.

4 Space-Time Lattice of Measurable Quan-

tities and Dual Lattice

So, provided the minimal length lmin exists, two lattices are naturally aris-
ing.
I. Lattice of the space-time variation—LatS−T representing, to within the
known multiplicative constants, the sets of nonzero integers Nw 6= 0 and
Nt 6= 0 in the corresponding formulas from the set Equations (34) and (45)
for each of the three space variables w

.
= x; y; z and the time variable t

LatS−T

.
= (Nw, Nt).

(47)

Which restrictions should be initially imposed on these sets of nonzero

integers?

It is clear that in every such set all the integers (Nw, Nt) should be
suﬃciently “close”, because otherwise, for one and the same space-time
point, variations in the values of its diﬀerent coordinates are associated
with principally diﬀerent values of the energy E which are “far” from each
other.

Note that the words “close” and “far” will be elucidated further in this

text.

Thus, at the admittedly low energies (Low Energies) E ≪ Emax ∝ EP

the low-energy part (sublattice) LatS−T [LE] of LatS−T is as follows:

LatS−T [LE] = (Nw, Nt) ≡ (|Nx| ≫ 1,|Ny| ≫,|Nz| ≫ 1,|Nt| ≫ 1).

(48)

At high energies (High Energies) E → Emax ∝ EP we, on the contrary, have
the sublattice LatS−T [HE] of LatS−T

LatS−T [HE] = (Nw, Nt) ≡ (|Nx| ≈ 1,|Ny| ≈ 1,|Nz| ≈ 1,|Nt| ≈ 1).
II. Next let us deﬁne the lattice momenta-energies variation LatP −E as a
set to obtain (px(Nx,p), py(Ny,p), pz(Nz,p), E(Nt)) in the nonrelativistic and
ultrarelativistic cases for all energies, and as a set to obtain

(49)

15

components of the above sets conform to the space coordinates (x, y, z) and

from the previous Section.

Note that, because of the suggestion made after formula Equation (38)
in the previous Section, we can state that the foregoing sets exhaust all the
collections of momentums and energies possible for the lattice LatS−T .

Considering Remark 1 from the previous Section, it should be noted
that, as currently the low energies E ≪ Emax ∝ EP are veriﬁed by numer-
ous experiments and thoroughly studied, the sublattice LatP −E[LE] Equa-
tion (51) is correctly deﬁned and rigorously determined by the sublattice
LatS−T [LE] Equation (48).

the sublattice LatP −E[HE] may be deﬁned more exactly.

However, at high energies E → Emax ∝ EP we can not be so conﬁdent
Speciﬁcally, αa is obviously a small parameter. And, as demonstrated

in [45, 46], in the case of GUP we have the following:

[~x, ~p] = i(1 + a1α + a2α2 + ...).

(53)

But, according to Equation (18), |1/Na| = √αa, then, due to Equa-

tion (53), the denominators in the right-hand side of Equation (52) may be
w...,∝ 1/N 2
also varied by adding the terms ∝ 1/N 2
t ..., that
is liable to inﬂuence the ﬁnal result for |Nw| → 1,|Nt| → 1.
The notions “close” and “far” for LatP −E will be completely determined by
the dual lattice LatS−T [LE] and by Formulas (34) and (45).

It is important to note the following.
In the low-energy sublattice LatP −E[LE] all elements are varying very

smoothly enabling the approximation of a continuous theory.

practically continuously.

Then we suppose that only in the classical dynamics variations of mo-
menta (energies) have no lower bounds and we have dp. At the same time,
in a quantum dynamics, due to the limited spatial domains, these variations
have both upper and lower bounds.

In this case, as distinct from [28], in the theory there is a minimum
variation of the momentum ∆pmin that within the scope of the measurability

And since |Np| ≫ 1 is a variable, in fact pN is continuously varying and,
proceeding from the above formulae, we can assume that to a high accuracy
the function φ(pN ),(ψ∗(pN )) is diﬀerentiable in terms of this variable.

On the other hand, at high energies, when for |Np| ≈ 1 the presentation
is fairly discrete, the scalar product Equation (66) is replaced by the sum

We consider only two cases: (a) 1 ≪ |Np| ≤ eN, “Quantum Consid-
eration, Low Energies” and (b) |Np| ≈ 1,“Quantum Consideration, High
Energies”. The case (c)

eN ≪ |Np| < ∞

is omitted in this Section as it is associated with the “Classical Picture”.
Then at all the energy scales hψ|φiNp may be formally represented as

follows:

hψ|φiNp = hψ|φi1≪|Np|≤ eN + hψ|φi|Np|≈1.

(70)

However, with the formalism and terms proposed in this work, and also

with the use of the Formula (12) that in this case takes the form

(69)

(71)

(|Np| ≈ 1) → (1 ≪ |Np| ≤ eN),

it seems more logical to consider the two components in Equation (70)
separately, the ﬁrst component originating in the process of the low-energy
transition from the second component as follows:

hψ|φi|Np|≈1

|Np|≫1

⇒ hψ|φi1≪|Np|≤ eN.

(72)

Clearly, the ﬁrst part of formula (13) from [28] holds as well in the

general case for each of the components Equation (70)

The second part of formula (13) from [28]

h(ψ|p)|φi = hψ|(p|φ)i

h(ψ|x)|φi = hψ|(x|φ)i

i.e., for the ﬁrst component in Equation (70).

takes place (to a high accuracy) for the low-energy case 1 ≪ |Np| ≤ eN < ∞,
Indeed, in this case, due to the condition |Np| ≫ 1, we have

∆ppN ≈ dp; ∆−1

p ψ(pN ) ≈ ∂pψ(pN )

p ψ(pN ) = ∂pψ(pN ).

p (φ(pN )) ≈

(76)

It is important to note the following remarks:

(1) The operator x is deﬁned in the case of low energies only for the func-
tional space φ(pN )1≪|Np|≤ eN−1. Really, because of the existence of the For-
mula (61), the extreme point Np, (such that (Np + 1)(Np + 2) > N) “moves”
this operator beyond the domain under study ∆pmin = p. Therefore, re-
placing Np 7→ Np + 1, Np + 1 7→ Np + 2 in Formula (63), one can easily get
the estimate of eN − 1 instead of eN as seen in Equation (76).

(2) Despite the fact that the operator x is also deﬁned at high energies,
i.e., for φ(pN )|Np|≈1,in general the property Equation (74) in this case has
no place for lack of Formulae (75).

(3) In all the cases when we consider |Np| ≫ 1 (low energies) the “cut-
oﬀ” for some upper bound pmax,(pmax ≪ Ppl),1 ≪ Npmax < |Np|, p 6= pmax
is determined by the initial conditions of the solved problem.

(4) It is clear that in the relativistic case ∆pmin = p leads to a minimal
variation in the energy

|∆Emin| = (∆p)minc =

p
N

c.

(77)

(5) In this work a minimal variation of the momentum ∆pmin has been
introduced from the additional assumptions but, as shown in [47], a mini-
mal variation of the momentum may arise from the Extended Uncertainty

21

Principle (EUP) as follows:

∆xi∆pj ≥ δij[1 + β2 (∆xi)2

l2

],

(78)

where l is the characteristic, large length scale l ≫ lp and β is a dimension-
less real constant on the order of unity [47]. From Equation (78) we get an
absolute minimum in the momentum uncertainty

∆pi ≥

2β

l

.

(79)

In [48] GUP and EUP are combined by the principle called the Sym-

metric Generalized Uncertainty Principle (SGUP):

∆x∆p ≥ (cid:18)1 +

(∆x)2

2 (cid:19) ,
L2 + l2 (∆p)2

(80)

where l ≪ L and l deﬁnes the limit of the UV-cutoﬀ (not being such up to
a constant factor as in the case of GUP).Then

whereas L deﬁnes the limit for IR-cutoﬀ i.e., we have a

∆xmin = 2l/p1 − 4l2/L2 = ℓ,
∆pmin = 2/(Lp1 − 4l2/L2).

(6) Of course, this paper is only the ﬁrst step to resolve the Quantum
Theory in terms of the measurable quantities using Deﬁnition 2. It is nec-
essary to study thoroughly the low-energy case E ≪ EP and the correct
transition to high energies E ∝ EP . The author is planning to treat these
problems in his further works.

6 Gravity Markov’s Model in Terms of Mea-

surable Quantities

This heuristic model was introduced in the work [49] at the early eighties
of the last century. This model already considered by the author in his

22

previous paper [46] is treated from the standpoint of the above-mentioned
arguments. In [49], it is assumed that “by the universal decree of nature
a quantity of the material density ̺ is always bounded by its upper value
given by the expression that is composed of fundamental constants” ([49],
p. 214):

̺ ≤ ̺p =

c5
G2

,

with ̺p as “Planck’s density”.

Then the quantity

℘̺ = ̺/̺p ≤ 1

(81)

(82)

(84)

(85)

(86)

is the deformation parameter as it is used in [49] to construct the following
of Einstein equations deformation or ℘̺-deformation (Formula (2) in [49]):

µ =

8πG
c4 T ν

µ (1 − ℘2

Rν
µ −
µ –energy-momentum tensor, Λ—cosmological constant.

where n ≥ 1/2, T ν
The case of the parameter ℘̺ ≪ 1 or ̺ ≪ ̺p correlates with the clas-
sical Einstein equations, and the case when ℘̺ = 1—with the de Sitter
Universe. In this way Equation (83) may be considered as ℘̺-deformation
of the General Relativity.

̺ δν
̺)n − Λ℘2n
µ,

(83)

As shown in [46], ℘̺-of Einstein equations deformation Equation (83) is
nothing else but α-deformation of GR for the parameter αl at a = l from
Equation (13).
If ̺ = ̺l is the average material density for the Universe of the characteristic
linear dimension l, i.e., of the volume V ∝ l3, we have

℘l,̺ =

̺l
̺p ∝ α2

l = ωα2
l ,

where ω is some computable factor.

Then it is clear that αl-representation Equation (83) is of the form

µ −

Rδν

µ =

23

But, as r.h.s. of Equation (86) is dependent on αl of any value and
particularly in the case αl ≪ 1, i.e., at l ≫ ℓ, l.h.s of Equation (86) is also
dependent on αl of any value and Equation (86) may be written as

Rν
µ(αl) −

1
2

R(αl)δν

µ =

8πG
c4 T ν

µ (αl) − Λ(αl)δν

(87)

Thus, in this speciﬁc case we obtain the explicit dependence of GR on
l , that is insigniﬁcant at low energies or for l ≫ ℓ

the available energies E ∼ 1
and, on the contrary, signiﬁcant at high energies, l → ℓ.

6.1 Low Energies, E ≪ EP

1. Low energies. Nonmeasurable case. In this case at low energies, using
Formula (13) in the limit ℓ = 0 for a = l, we get a continuous theory coin-
cident with the General Relativity.

2. Low energies. Measurable case.
In this case at low energies, using
Formulas (13) and (18) for ℓ 6= 0, for a = l (and hence for Nl ≫ 1), we get a
discrete theory which is a “nearly continuous theory”, practically similar to
the General Relativity with the slowly (smoothly) varying parameter αl(t),
where t—time.
So, due to low energies and momentums (E ≪ EP , p ≪ PP l), the “continu-
ous case” 1 (General Relativity) and the “discrete case” 2 that is actually
a “nearly continuous case”.

6.2 High Energies, E ≈ EP

At high energies we consider the measurable case only. Then it is clear that
at high energies the parameter αl(t) is discrete and for the limiting value
of αl(t) = 1 we get a discrete series of equations of the form Equation (87)
(or a single equation of this form met by a discrete series of solutions)
corresponding to αl(t) = 1; 1/4; 1/9; ...

As this takes place, T ν

µ (αl) ≈ 0, and in both cases as 2 in 6.1 as well as 6.2
Λ(αl) is not longer a cosmological constant, being a dynamical cosmological
term.

24

Note that because of Formula (20) given in Section 3, √αl(t) in cases 2
in 6.1 and 6.2 is an element of the lattice LatP −E from Section 4. And in
case 2 it is an element of the sublattice LatP −E[LE], whereas case 6.2 is
associated with the sublattice LatP −E[HE].

It seems expedient to make some important remarks:

(1) In formulae (71) and (72) of Section 5 in this work we have consid-
ered the transition

Quantum T heory in High Energies (QT HE) ⇒
⇒ Quantum T heory in Low Energies (QT LE).

(88)

However, according to the modern knowledge, the (quantum) gravity
phase begins only at very high energies at Planck scales, i.e., the case (a)
from Section 5 is inexistent, and hence it is more correct to consider the
transition

Quantum T heory in High Energies (QT HE) ⇒
⇒ Classical T heory (Low Energies).

(89)

And this corresponds to the case (c) that has been omitted from con-

sideration in Section 5 Equation (69) with eN = 1
(|Np| ≈ 1) → (1 ≪ |Np| < ∞).

(90)

(2) Generally speaking, as 6.2 and case 2 in 6.1 are associated with mea-
surable cases for low energies and high energies, respectively, all the terms of
the Equation (87): Rν
µ (αl), Λ(αl) must be expressed in terms
of measurable quantities in view of Deﬁnition 2 from Section 3. But this
problem still remains to be solved. In fact, it is reduced to the construction
of the following “measurable” deformations in the sense of Deﬁnition 2 in
Section 3 as follows:

µ(αl), R(αl), T ν

lim
ℓ→0

(Rν

µ(αl ≪ 1), R(αl ≪ 1), T ν

µ (αl ≪ 1), Λ(αl ≪ 1)) →

µ, R, T ν

→ (Rν

(91)

25

and

lim

(Rν
µ(αl ≪ 1), R(αl ≪ 1)δν

µ (αl ≪ 1), Λ(αl ≪ 1)) →
µ , Λ).

µ, R, T ν

→ (Rν

(92)

Here the ﬁrst Equation (91) is a pure low-energy limiting transition from
the measurable variant of gravity to the nonmeasurable one (or from a dis-
crete theory to a continuous theory), whereas the second Equation (92)
from the beginning is associated with the measurable transition from high
energies to low energies and then is coincident with the ﬁrst one.

(3) It should be noted that in [1, 2] in terms of measurable quantities, as an
example, we have studied gravity for the static spherically-symmetric hori-
zon space. It has been shown that, “...despite the absence of inﬁnitesimal
spatial-temporal increments owing to the existence of lmin and the essential
‘discreteness’ of a theory, this discreteness at low energies is not ‘felt’, the
theory in fact being close to the original continuum theory. The indicated
discreteness is signiﬁcant only in the case of high (Planck) energies ” [1].
The Markov model considered in this section represents the generalization
of the above-mentioned example. Of course, this model requires further
thorough investigation in terms of measurable quantities.

7 Conclusions

7.1 Measurable and Non-Measurable Transitions in

Gravity

The illustration considered in the preceding Section (Gravity Markov’s Model)
is universal considering the following:

First, using the formalism of this work, it is required to construct a mea-
surable deformation of the General Relativity (GR) at low energies (Formula
(91)). This deformation is denoted in terms of Grav[LE]ℓ

Grav[LE]ℓ ℓ→0⇒ GR.

26

(93)

Next, we should construct the high-energy deformation (denoted in
terms of Grav[HE]ℓ), this time for Grav[LE]ℓ (the ﬁrst arrow in the For-
mula (92))

Grav[HE]ℓ αl→0

⇒ Grav[LE]ℓ.

(94)

At the present time the majority of the proposed approaches to quan-
tization of gravity are associated with the construction of the following
transition:

GR⇒Grav[HE]ℓ.

(95)

But, by the author opinion, this is impossible. It seems that for correct
quantization of gravity one needs reversal of the arrow from Equation (94)

Grav[LE]ℓ(αl ≈ 0, αl 6= 0)

αl→1

⇒ Grav[HE]ℓ(αl ≈ 1).

(96)

The above results indicate that the low-energy “measurable” gravity
variant Grav[LE]ℓ should be very close to GR but diﬀerent at the same
time.

The author is hopeful that the correct construction of a low-energy Gravℓ
close to GR allows for a more natural transition to quantum (Planck) grav-
ity. Besides, within the notion of measurability, gravity could be saved from
some odd solutions, from wormholes in particular.

7.2 Measurable and Non-measurable Transitions in

Quantum Theory

The situation is similar for a quantum theory too.
In the general case,
based on the parameter αa (Formula (18) of Section 3), this means that
there exists the following correct limiting high-energy transition:

lim

ℓ6=0,|Na|≫1

αa

High Energy

⇒

lim

ℓ6=0,|Na|≈1

αa

and there is no correct limiting high-energy transition

lim
ℓ=0

αa

High Energy

⇒

lim

ℓ6=0,|Na|≈1

αa.

27

(97)

(98)

The ﬁrst of them corresponds to the transition from a measurable theory

at low energies to a measurable theory at high energies

QT [LE]ℓ Na→1⇒ QT [HE]ℓ.

Whereas the second

QT Na→1⇒ QT [HE]ℓ

(99)

(100)

(here QT [LE]ℓ, QT [HE]ℓ, QT are quantum theories with the minimal length
ℓ 6= 0 at low energies E ≪ Ep, at high energies E ≈ Ep, and the well-known
(continuous) quantum theory with lmin = 0).
However, the whole theoretical physics, where presently at low energies
E ≪ EP the minimal length ℓ is not involved at all (i.e., lmin = 0), is framed
around a search for the nonexistent limits Equation (98) (correspondingly
Equation (100)).

Of course, in this case the low-energy “measurable” variant QT [LE]ℓ of
QT by its results will be very close to the initial theory QT , as indicated
in [1, 2], and Section 5 of the present work. But these theories are diﬀerent
by nature: the ﬁrst of them is discrete and the second one is continuous.
Nevertheless, it is clear that the main requirement in this case is associated
with the “Compatibility Principe”:

at low energies the resolved variant QT [LE]ℓ must, to a high accuracy, repre-
sent the well-known approved results of the corresponding continuous theory
QT .

These theories should be diﬀering considerably at least on going to high

energies E ≈ Ep.
The hypothesis set by the author is that correct construction of the
“measurable” transition to high energies (Formula (99)) should naturally
lead to solution of the ultraviolet divergences problem (initially in terms of
the ﬁnite measurable quantities).

7.3 Summary of 7.1 and 7.2 is Such [2]
1. When in the theory the minimal length lmin 6= 0 is actualized (involved)
at all the energy scales, a mathematical apparatus of this theory must be

28

changed considerably: no inﬁnitesimal space-time variations (increments)
must be involved, the key role being played by the deﬁnition of measurabil-
ity (Deﬁnition 2 from Section 3).

2. As this takes place the theory becomes discrete at all the energy scales
but at low energies (far from the Planck energies) the sought for theory must
be very close in its results to the starting continuous theory (with lmin = 0).
In the process a real discreteness is exhibited only at high energies which
are close to the Planck energies.

3. By this approach the theory at low and high energies is associated with
a common single set of the parameters (NL from Formula (10)) or with the
dimensionless small parameters (1/NL = √αL) which are lacking if at low
energies the theory is continuous, i.e., when lmin = 0.

The principal objective of my further studies is to develop for quantum
theory and gravity, within the scope of the considerations given in points
1–3, the corresponding discrete models (with lmin 6= 0) for all the energy
scales and to meet the following requirements:
4. At low energies the models must, to a high accuracy, represent the re-
sults of the corresponding continuous theories.
5. The models should not have the problems of transition from low to high
energies and, speciﬁcally, the ultraviolet divergences problem. By author’s
opinion, the problem associated with points 4 and 5 is as follows.
6. It is interesting to know why, with the existing lmin 6= 0, tmin 6= 0 and
discreteness of nature, at low energies E ≪ Emax ∝ EP the apparatus of
mathematical analysis based on the use of inﬁnitesimal space-time quan-
tities (dxµ, ∂ϕ
, and so on) is very eﬃcient giving excellent results. The
∂xµ
answer is simple: in this case lmin and tmin are very far from the available
scale of L and t, the corresponding NL ≫ 1, Nt ≫ 1 being in general true
but insuﬃcient. There is a need for rigorous calculations.
