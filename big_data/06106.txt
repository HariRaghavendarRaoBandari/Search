Abstract. The notion of a parallelizable distribution has been introduced and inves-
tigated. A non-integrable parallelizable distribution carries a natural sub-Riemannian
structure. The geometry of this structure has been studied from the bi-viewpoint of ab-
solute parallelism geometry and sub-Riemannian geometry. Two remarkable linear con-
nections have been constructed on a sub-Riemannian parallelizable distribution, namely,
the Weitzenb¨ock connection and the sub-Riemannian connection. The obtained results
have been applied to two concrete examples: the spheres S3 and S7.

Keywords: bracket generating distribution, parallelizable distribution, sub-Riemannian
structure, Weitzenb¨ock connection, sub-Riemannian connection, spheres S3 and S7.

1. Introduction

Sub-Riemannian Geometry [1, 4, 10, 15, 16] has many applications such as diﬀusion,
mechanics, gauge theories and control theory [7, 13]. Absolute parallelism geometry or
the geometry of parallelizable manifolds [3, 17, 20, 21] is frequently used for applications
in physics, especially in the geometrization of physical theories such general relativity
and gravitation [6, 12, 14, 18, 19].

Several attempts [2, 5, 8, 9] have been made to construct a connection theory in
sub-Riemannian geometry. Our approach is diﬀerent. We deﬁne a parallelizable distri-
bution (PD) on a ﬁnite dimensional manifold M. A non-integrable PD on M carries
simultaneously two structures: an absolute parallelism structure and a sub-Riemannian
structure. We make use of both structures to build up a connection theory on PD’s.
Two remarkable connections have been constructed on a sub-Riemannian parallelizable
distribution, namely, the Weitzenb¨ock connection and the sub-Riemannian connection.
The obtained results have been applied to the spheres S3 and S7.

The wide spectrum of applications of both sub-Riemannian geometry and absolute
parallelism geometry makes our approach, which enjoys the advantages of both geome-
tries, a potential candidate for more applications in diﬀerent ﬁelds.

2. Parallelizable distribution and Sub-Riemannian structure

We ﬁrst give some fundamental deﬁnitions concerning sub-Riemannian geometry. For
a more detailed exposition of Sub-Riemannian geometry, we refer to [1, 4, 10, 15, 16].
By a manifold M, we mean an n-dimensional smooth manifold.

Deﬁnition 2.1. A distribution of rank k on a manifold M is a map D that assigns
to each point p ∈ M a k-dimensional subspace Dp of TpM. A distribution D may be

regarded as a vector sub-bundle (Sp∈M Dp) −→ M of the tangent bundle T M −→ M.

A Distribution D of rank k is diﬀerentiable if every point p ∈ M has a neighborhood U
and smooth k-vector ﬁelds Y1, · · · Yk on U such that Y1(q), · · · Yk(q) form a basis of Dq
for all q ∈ U, i.e., D = Span{Y1, · · · Yk} on U.

We shall always deal with diﬀerentiable distributions.

Deﬁnition 2.2. A Distribution D on M is integrable if it admits a unique maximal
integral manifold through each point of M. A Distribution D is involutive if [X, Y ] ∈
D for all X, Y ∈ D.

According to Frobenius theorem, a distribution D is integrable if and only if it is

involutive.

Deﬁnition 2.3. A distribution D on M is bracket generating if there exists an integer
r ≥ 1 such that Dr

p = TpM for all p ∈ M, where

p = Dp,

and [Dp, Ds

If r does not exist, we say that the distribution is of inﬁnite step.

p}.

p = TpM is said to be the step of the distribution D.

Deﬁnition 2.4. A sub-Riemannian metric on a distribution D is a map g that assigns
to each point p ∈ M a positive deﬁnite inner product gp : Dp × Dp −→ R and gp varies
smoothly.

Deﬁnition 2.5. A sub-Riemannian structure on M is a pair (D, g) where D is a non-
integrable (bracket generating) distribution on M and g is a smooth sub-Riemannian
metric on D. In this case, M is said to be a sub-Riemannian manifold.

In the following we shall deal with a certain type of distributions, namely, paral-
lelizable distributions. Throughout the paper, M will denote an n-dimensional smooth
manifold, C ∞(M) the algebra of smooth functions on M, X(M) the C ∞(M)-module of
smooth vector ﬁelds on M and Γ(D) the C ∞(M)-module of smooth sections of a distri-
bution D. Einstein summation convention will be applied to all pairs of repeated indices
even when they are both down. We shall follow the notations and use the results of [20].

Deﬁnition 2.6. A distribution HM on M of rank k < n is said to be parallelizable if it
admits k independent global smooth sections
X ∈ Γ(HM), called paralellization
X | i = 1, · · · , k}. A parallelizable distribution

generated by

X will be denoted by (M, HM,

X) or, simply, by (HM,

X, · · · ,

X).

Proposition 2.7. Every parallelizable distribution admits a sub-Riemannian metric.

Proof. Let (HM,

Ω(Y ) for all Y ∈ Γ(HM).

i

According to [15, 16], there exists a metric extension G for g that makes the split
T M = HM ⊕ V M G-orthogonal, where V M := (HM)⊥. This decomposition of T M
induces two projectors h : T M → HM and v : T M → V M, called horizontal and vertical
projectors, respectively. The projectors h and v are C ∞(M)-linear with the properties
h2 = h, v2 = v, h ◦ v = v ◦ h = 0 and h + v = idT M .

3. Linear connections on parallelizable distributions

In this section, we explore the natural sub-Riemannian structure associated with
a parallelizable distribution (HM,
X). We introduce and investigate two remarkable
connections on HM, namely, the Weitzenb¨ock connection and the sub-Riemannian con-
nection. The last one generalizes the Levi-Civita connection to the sub-Riemannian case.
We shall continue to follow the notations and use the results of [20].

i

Theorem 3.1. Let (HM,
X) be a parallelizable distribution of rank k on M. Then,
there exists a unique linear connection ∇ on HM for which the parallelization sections
X are parallel:

i

i

∇Y

X = 0 ∀ Y ∈ X(M).

i

(3.1)

Proof. To prove the uniqueness assume that ∇ is a linear connection satisfying the
condition ∇

X = 0. For all Y ∈ X(M), Z ∈ Γ(HM) we have, by (2.1) and (3.1),

i

∇Y Z = ∇Y(cid:0) i

Ω(Z)

X(cid:1) =

i

Ω(Z)∇Y

i

X +(cid:0)Y ·

i

Ω(Z)(cid:1) i

X = (cid:0)Y ·

i

Hence, the connection ∇ is uniquely determined by the relation

Ω(Z)(cid:1) i

i

X.

∇Y Z = (cid:0)Y ·

Ω(Z)(cid:1) i

i

X.

(3.2)

To prove the existence, let ∇ : X(M) × Γ(HM) −→ Γ(HM) be deﬁned by (3.2). It

is easy to show that ∇ is a linear connection on HM with the required property.

The unique linear connection ∇ on HM deﬁned by (3.2) will be called the Weitzenb¨ock

or the canonical connection of (HM,

X).

i

Corollary 3.2. The canonical connection ∇ of (HM,

X) is metric: ∇g = 0.

i

Deﬁnition 3.3. Let (HM,

i

(a) The torsion tensor of the canonical connection is deﬁned by:

T : X(M) × X(M) −→ Γ(HM);

T (Y, Z) = ∇Y hZ − ∇ZhY − h[Y, Z].

(b) The curvature tensor of the canonical connection is deﬁned by:

R : X(M) × X(M) × Γ(HM) −→ Γ(HM);

R(Y, Z)W := ∇Y ∇ZW − ∇Z∇Y W − ∇[Y, Z]W.

The torsion and curvature tensors of an arbitrary linear connection on (HM,

The torsion tensor T of ∇ has the properties:

X,

j

T (vY,

X) = −h[vY,

j

X],

j

T (vY, vZ) = −h[vY, vZ].

Because of the property (3.1), the curvature tensor of the canonical connection vanishes
identically.

Proposition 3.4. On a parallelizable distribution (HM,
two other linear connections on HM associated with the canonical connection:

X) of rank k on M there are

Proposition 3.5. Let e∇ and b∇ be the dual and symmetric connections, respectively.
(a) The torsion and curvature tensors of e∇ are given respectively by:

Moreover, T (HM, HM) = 0 if [

Note that the connection b∇ is qualiﬁed by the adjective ”symmetric” because its

torsion vanishes on HM, as shown in (a) above.

Deﬁnition 3.7. Given a vector ﬁeld W ∈ X(M), the horizontal Lie derivative with
respect to W of the metric tensor g is deﬁned, for all Y, Z ∈ Γ(HM), by:

(LW g)(Y, Z) := W.g(Y, Z) + g(h[Y, W ], Z) + g(h[Z, W ], Y ).

It is clear that

(Lf W g)(Y, Z) = f (LW g)(Y, Z) + (Y.f ) g(hW, Z) + (Z.f ) g(hW, Y ).

For the uniqueness, assume that ∇ is another linear connection satisfying (a), (b) and

(c). Deﬁne the tensor ψ(W, Z) :=

∇W Z −∇W Z. Then for Y, Z ∈ Γ(HM), V ∈ Γ(V M),

g(ψ(V, Z), Y )

= −g(Z, ψ(V, Y )) = −g(Z,
(c)
= −g(Y,
= −g(Y, ψ(V, Z)).

◦
T (V, Z) − T (V, Z))

◦
T (V, Y ) − T (V, Y ))

On the other hand, for X, Y, Z ∈ Γ(HM),

g(ψ(X, Z), Y )

(a)
= −g(Z, ψ(X, Y ))
(b)
= g(X, ψ(Z, Y ))

(b)
= −g(Z, (Y, X))

(a)
= −g(Y, ψ(Z, X))

(a)
= g(X, ψ(Y, Z))
(b)
= −g(Y, ψ(X, Z)).

Hence, ψ(W, Z) := 0 ∀ W ∈ X(M), Z ∈ Γ(HM), which completes the proof.

The above table provides some sort of classiﬁcation of sub-Riemannian parallelizable
distributions on S7. We have 7 PD’s of rank 6 (spanned by diﬀerent choices of 6 sections
from the 7 ones

PD’s of rank 3 and 21 PD’s of rank 2.

The same discussion can be made for the other rows of the table where we consider

or non BG.

It should ﬁnally be noted that the details of Maple calculations of S3 and S7 are

available on demand.
