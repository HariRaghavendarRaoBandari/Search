Abstract. The existence of two diﬀerent Cantor sets, one of them contained
in the set of Liouville numbers and the other one inside the set of Diophan-
tine numbers, is proved. Finally, a necessary and suﬃcient condition for the
existence of a Cantor set contained in a subset of the real line is given.

Introduction

First, we will introduce some basic topological concepts about the real line R.

Definition 1.1. A set X ⊂ R is nowhere dense if int(X) = ∅.

Definition 1.2. A nonempty set C ⊂ R is a Cantor set if C is nowhere dense and
perfect (i.e. C = C ′).

We denote by Q the set of rational numbers. The symbol Z is used to denote

the set of integers and Z+ = {1, 2, . . .} denotes the positive integers.

Definition 1.3. Let α ∈ R \ Q. We say that α is a Liouville number if for all
n ∈ N = {0, 1, 2, . . .}, there exist integer numbers p = pn and q = qn, such that
q > 1 and

If β ∈ R is not a Liouville number, we say that β is a Diophantine number. The
sets of Liouville and Diophantine numbers are, respectively, denoted by L and D.

Joseph Liouville, by giving two diﬀerent proofs, showed the existence of tran-
scendental numbers for the ﬁrst time in 1844 ([1, 2]). Later, in 1851 ([3]) more
detailed versions of these proofs were given. It was also shown in [3] that the real
number

which was already mentioned in [1], is a transcendental number. It is worth noting
that the techniques used in [1, 2, 3] allow proving that all Liouville numbers are
transcendental.

Some general properties of the set of Liouville numbers are: L is a null set under
the Lebesgue measure (i.e. λ(L) = 0), it is a dense Gδ set in the real line, L is an
uncountable set and, more speciﬁcally, it has the cardinality of the continuum. Since
the Lebesgue measure of the Diophantine numbers is inﬁnity, it is an uncountable
set. From the fact that there exists a Cantor set in D, and since any uncountable
closed set in R has the cardinality of the continuum, it follows that D has also the
cardinality of the continuum. Moreover, in view of the density of Q in R, the set
of Diophantine numbers is also dense in the real line. In addition, D is a set of ﬁrst
category.

Now, we would like to prove a basic result related to the fact that the property
of being a Cantor set is preserved by homeomorphisms when the homeomorphic
image of its domain is a closed subset of R.

Proposition 1.1. Let A, B ⊂ R. Suppose that f : A 7−→ B is a homeomorphism
and B is a closed subset of R. If C ⊂ A is a Cantor set, then f (C) ⊂ B is also a
Cantor set.

Proof. From the fact that C ⊂ A is a perfect set, we get that C is closed subset of
R. Moreover, since f −1 is continuous, we have that (f −1)−1(C) = f (C) is a closed
set in B, and since B is a closed subset of R, it follows that f (C) is closed in R.
Now, we claim that f (C) ⊂ (f (C))′. In fact, let y ∈ f (C) and ε > 0. So, there is
x ∈ C such that y = f (x). Since f is continuous at x, there exists δ > 0 such that

z ∈ A,

|z − x| < δ =⇒ |f (z) − f (x)| < ε.

(1.2)

Considering that x ∈ C = C ′, there exists z0 ∈ C ⊂ A such that 0 < |z0 − x| < δ,
and by (1.2) we deduce that |f (z0) − f (x)| < ε. Furthermore, the injectivity of f
implies that f (x) 6= f (z0). Then, f (z0) ∈ (B(y, ε) \ {y}) ∩ f (C). In consequence,
y ∈ (f (C))′. Hence, f (C) is a perfect set in R. On the other hand, since C 6= ∅,
we see that f (C) 6= ∅. Finally, we will show that int(f (C)) = ∅. We suppose,
by contradiction, that there exists y ∈ int(f (C)). Then, there is r > 0 such that
(y − r, y + r) ⊂ f (C). Since (y − r, y + r) is a connected set, we have that f −1((y −
r, y + r)) ⊂ C ⊂ A is also a connected set. Let us take u, v ∈ f −1((y − r, y + r))
such that u < v. Then, (u, v) ⊂ f −1((y − r, y + r)) ⊂ C. Thus, int(C) 6= ∅, which

SOME EXISTENCE RESULTS ON CANTOR SETS

is a contradiction. Hence, int(f (C)) = ∅. Since, f (C) is a nonempty perfect and
nowhere dense set in R, we conclude that f (C) is a Cantor set.
(cid:3)

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the existence of a Cantor set in
the set of Liouville numbers is proved. Section 3 is devoted to show the existence
of a Cantor set inside the set of Diophantine real numbers. Finally, in Section 4, a
necessary and suﬃcient condition for the existence of a Cantor set contained in a
subset of R is given. It deserves remark that Bendixson’s Theorem is used in the
proofs of the main results given in Sections 2, 3 and 4.

2. Existence of a Cantor set contained in the Liouville Numbers

We begin this section showing the existence of an uncountable closed set, S,
contained in L. Then, by using the Bendixson Theorem, we obtain a nonempty
perfect set, C1 ⊂ S ⊂ L. Finally, since λ(L) = 0, where λ is the Lebesgue measure
on the real line, we conclude that C1 is nowhere dense.

First, let us consider the following set

A = {x = (xn)n∈N ∈ 2N : x2n + x2n+1 = 1,

∀n ∈ N}.

(2.1)

The next result concerns the cardinality of set A.

Lemma 2.1. The set A, given in (2.1), has the cardinality of the continuum.

Proof. Let f be the function given by

f : A 7−→ 2N
x 7−→ y,

where y = (yn)n∈N ∈ 2N is deﬁned by

yn =(cid:26) 1,

0,

if x2n+1 = 1,
if x2n = 1,

for all n ∈ N. From the deﬁnition of function f , one gets that f is bijective. Then,
|A| = |2N|. Since c = |R| = |2N|, we conclude that A has the cardinality of the
continuum.
(cid:3)

Using (2.1), we deﬁne the set

S =(+∞Xn=1

xn−1
10n!

: x = (xn)n∈N ∈ A) .

(2.2)

The following lemma will be used in the proof of Proposition 2.1.

Lemma 2.2. Let z = (zi)i∈Z+ be a sequence such that zi ∈ {−1, 0, 1} for all i ∈ Z+.
If

then zi = 0 for all i ∈ Z+.

Proof. Since

Thus, |z1| < 1

tion, that for n ∈ Z+ such that n ≥ 2, we have that zk = 0 for k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n − 1}.
From the fact that

where we have used the fact that −n(n!) ≤ −4 for n ∈ {2, 3, . . .}. Hence, |zn| < 1,
and thus we conclude that zn = 0.
(cid:3)

The next proposition shows that the set S has the cardinality of the continuum.

Proposition 2.1. Let S and A be the sets respectively deﬁned by (2.2) and (2.1).
Then, |S| = |A| = c.

Proof. Let g be the function given by

g :

x = (xn)n∈N

By the deﬁnition of function g, we see that g is surjective. Moreover, by Lemma 2.2,
it follows that g is injective. Therefore, we conclude that g is bijective. Hence,
|S| = |A| = c.
(cid:3)

Proposition 2.2. The set S ⊂ R, given in (2.2), is a closed set.

Proof. Let y ∈ R be such that there is a sequence (xn)n∈N in S with lim
So, for every n ∈ N, we can write

Let us remark that, by using a standard proof, it is possible to show that

S ⊂ L.

(2.13)

We now proceed to prove the key theorem of this section.

Theorem 2.1. There is a set C1 ⊂ L such that C1 is a Cantor set.

Proof. Let S be the set given by (2.2). By Propositions 2.1 and 2.2, S is an
uncountable closed subset of R. Let C1 be the set of all condensation points of S.

Thus, by Bendixson’s Theorem, S = (S \ C1)U C1, where S \ C1 is countable and

C1 is a perfect set. It follows that C1 is an uncountable subset of the real line.
Moreover, since λ(L) = 0 and C1 ⊂ S ⊂ L, we have that C1 is a nowhere dense
subset of R. We may therefore conclude that C1 is a Cantor set.

Theorem 3.1. There is a set C2 ⊂ D such that C2 is a Cantor set.

Proof. Since λ(L) = 0, D is an uncountable set. Using (3.1), we see that there is
a k ∈ N such that Dk is an uncountable set. Let C2 be the set of all condensation

points of Dk. By Bendixson’s Theorem, Dk = (Dk \ C2)U C2, where Dk \ C2 is

countable and C2 is a perfect set. We see that C2 is an uncountable subset of R.
Also, since Dk is a nowhere dense set, we get that C2 is also nowhere dense. Hence,
C2 is a Cantor set contained in D.

4. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a

Cantor set contained in a subset of the real line

We begin this section with a preliminary result.

Lemma 4.1. Every nonempty perfect set in R contains a Cantor set.

Proof. Let P ⊂ R be a nonempty perfect set. There are two cases to consider.

If int(P ) = ∅, then P is a Cantor set.
If a ∈ int(P ), there is r > 0 such that (a − r, a + r) ⊂ P . Let C be the usual

triadic Cantor set in the closed interval(cid:2)a − r

(cid:3)

Finally, we show the purpose of this section.

Theorem 4.1. X ⊂ R contains a Cantor set if and only if X contains a closed
and uncountable subset of R.

Proof. Let S ⊂ X be a closed and uncountable subset of the real line. By Bendix-
son’s Theorem, there is a perfect and uncountable set P ⊂ S. By Lemma 4.1, there
is a Cantor set C, such that C ⊂ P ⊂ X. Reciprocally, since all Cantor sets are
closed and uncountable, the theorem is proved.
