We obtain the exact solution of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in a suitable minisuper-

space with a cosmological constant, which is given in terms of the triconﬂuent Heun

functions. The ﬁrst three Heun polynomials of the triconﬂuent function are written

explicitly. The energy density spectrum is also obtained. The wave functions as well

as the energy density levels codify the role played by the cosmological constant.

with constant negative curvature, a ﬂat space, and a sphere of constant positive curvature,

respectively. The energy density ˜ρ is generally written as

with

we will analyse the WDE for ω = 0, 1/3, −1.

A. Case ω = 0: matter predominance

We are interested in the matter era, so that we will solve the WDE for ω = 0, which is

given by

The behaviour of Vef f (a) for this case is shown in Figs. (1) and (2).

It is more suitable to rewrite Eq. (9) in terms of dimensionless quantities. To do this, we

ﬁrst introduce the dimensionless parameter

Now, we can rewrite Eq. (14) in the form which resembles a Heun equation, by deﬁning

a new dependent variable ψ as

ψ(x) = e− 1

2 (x3+γx)P (x) ,

(16)

where P (x) is to be determined appropriatelly. Substituting Eq. (16) into Eq. (14), we

conclude that P (x) must satisfy the equation

1. Triconﬂuent Heun equation (THE)

Equation (17) is a particular case of the THE, which in the canonical form (refered by

+ [α + (β − 3)x]y = 0 ,

(18)

where y(x) = HeunT(α, β, γ; x) are the triconﬂuent Heun functions.

Let us assume that the solutions of Eq. (18) can be written as

y(x) =

Solution of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and the triconﬂuent Heun functions

Thus, Eq. (25) gives the following recursion relations for the expansion coeﬃcients

2u2 = γu1 − αu0 ,

6u3 = 2γu2 + αu1 − (β − 3)u0 ,

(S + 3)(S + 2)uS+3 = γ(S + 2)uS+2 + αuS+1 − (β − 3 − 3S)uS, S ≥ 0 .

(26)

Considering an appropriate choices of u0 and u1, and taking into account a convenient change

in notation, we have

where u−1 = 0.

Now, for (α, β, γ) ∈ C3, the triconﬂuent Heun functions can be written as

HeunT(α, β, γ; x) = Xs≥0

us(α, β, γ)xs ,

(28)

where us(α, β, γ), given by Eq. (27), is a polynomial in the three variables α, β, γ.

2. Heun polynomials

From the recursion relation given by Eq. (26), the function HeunT(α, β, γ; x) becomes a

polynomial of degree n if and only if the two following conditions are fulﬁlled3:

(i) β = 3(n + 1), n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,

(ii) Πn+1(α, γ) = 0 ,

(29)

where Πn+1 is a polynomial in α, γ (namely, it has degree n + 1 in α).

Now, let us return to the wave functions ψ(x). Using Eq. (16), we see that the physically

acceptable solutions of Eq. (17) are given by

ψn(x) = e− 1

2 (x3+γx)Pn(α, γ; x) ,

(31)

where the functions Pn(α, γ; x) are polynomials of degree n satisfying the triconﬂuent Heun

equation given by Eq. (18), with β = 3(n + 1), Πn+1 = 0, and 0 ≤ s ≤ n, namely:

d2Pn
dx2 − (γ + 3x2)

dPn
dx

+ (α + 3nx)Pn = 0 .

(32)

The polynomials Pn(α, γ; x) = HeunT(α, 3(n + 1), γ; x) are called Heun polynomials of

the triconﬂuent case, and therefore, are given by

Pn(α, γ; x) =

n

Xs=0

us(α, 3(n + 1), γ)xs .

(33)

It is clear from the foregoing discussion that they are uniquely deﬁned, except for an arbi-

trary multiplicative constant. Substituting Eq. (33) into Eq. (32), we obtain the following

recurrence relation of order 2

3un−1 + αun − γ(n + 1)un+1 + (n + 1)(n + 2)un+2 = 0 ,

(34)

where u−1 = 0. Indeed, the relation (34) with n = 0 gives u−1 = 0 if and only if Πn+1(α, γ) =

0. If this is the case, computing recursively the us in decreasing order, starting with un = 1,

(36)

(37)

where Q(x) is a polynomial with degree ≤ n − 4.

In our case, the parameter α takes the value γ2/4, and the parameter γ is given by

Eq. (15). Therefore, the expression of the Heun polynomials Pn(α, γ; x), for n = 0, 1, 2, are

as follows:

• n = 0, β = 3, Π0+1 = 0 ⇒ α = 0,

P0(α, γ; x) = 1 ,

• n = 1, β = 6, Π1+1 = 0 ⇒ α2 + 3γ = 0,

density levels are shown too.

3. Energy levels

In order to obtain the energy density spectrum, let us use Eqs. (10) and (29). Thus, the

energy density spectrum for a Wheeler-DeWitt particle in a suitable minisuperspace is given

by

we can rewritten the energy spectrum as

We see from Eq. (42) that this quantum mechanical energy spectrum consist of an inﬁnite

sequence of discrete levels (see Fig. 3), which are equally spaced. Note that the eigenvalues

given by Eq. (42) are non-degenerate.
