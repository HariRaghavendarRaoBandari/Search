Abstract

In this paper we give two families of non-metrizable topologies on the group of the integers having a countable dual group
which is isomorphic to a inﬁnite torsion subgroup of the unit circle in the complex plane. Both families are related to D-sequences,
which are sequences of natural numbers such that each term divides the following. The ﬁrst family consists of locally quasi-convex
group topologies. The second consists of complete topologies which are not locally quasi-convex. In order to study the dual groups
for both families we need to make numerical considerations of independent interest.

Keywords: Locally quasi-convex topology, D-sequence, continuous character, inﬁnite torsion subgroups of T.

1 Introduction and Notation.

The most important class of topological abelian groups are the locally compact groups. In this class, the most interesting theorems
can be proved. In this paper we consider a wider class of groups, which is the class of locally quasi-convex groups. Clearly, locally
compact groups are locally quasi-convex, since they can be considered as a dual group (in fact, a locally compact abelian group is
isomorphic to its bidual group) and dual groups are locally quasi-convex.

This paper is part of a project about duality, which intends to solve, among others, the Mackey Problem (ﬁrst stated in [7]).
This problem asks whether there exists a maximum element in the family of all locally quasi-convex compatible topologies (see
Deﬁnition 1.12).

We present two diﬀerent kinds of topologies on the group of the integers, having as common feature that topologies in both

families have countable dual group, which is isomorphic to an inﬁnite torsion subgroup of the unit circle in the complex plane:

On the one hand, the topologies presented in Section 3 are metrizable, non-complete and locally quasi-convex and the results

contained are the natural further steps of the ones given in [2].

On the other hand, the topologies presented in Section 4 are complete, non-metrizable but they are not locally quasi-convex.
These topologies, introduced by Graev, were thoroughly studied by Protasov and Zelenyuk. Precisely, in [15], a neighborhood
basis for this topology is given and this allows us to study these topologies on Z from a numerical point of view. The fact that these
topologies have countable dual group is surprising due to the belief that the more open set the topology has, the more continuous
characters it should have.

All the groups considered will be abelian and the notation will be additive.
In order to state properly the Mackey Problem, we need ﬁrst to recall some notation on duality:

Deﬁnition 1.1 We will consider the unit circle as

We will consider in T the following neighborhood basis:

Deﬁnition 1.2 Let (G, τ) be a topological group. Denote by G∧ the set of continuous homomorphisms (or continuous characters)
CHom(G, T). This set is a group when we consider the operation ( f + g)(x) = f (x) + g(x). In addition, if we consider the compact
open topology on G∧ it is a topological group. The topological group G∧ is called the dual group of G.

Deﬁnition 1.3 The natural embedding

is deﬁned by

where

Proposition 1.4 αG is a homomorphism.

Proof:

αG : G → G∧∧,

x 7→ αG(x) : G∧ → T,

χ 7→ χ(x).

αG(x + y)(χ) = χ(x + y) = χ(x)χ(y) = αG(x)(χ)αG(y)(χ) = (αG(x)αG(y))(χ), for all χ ∈ G∧.
Thus, αG(x + y) = αG(x)αG(y)

QED

Deﬁnition 1.5 A topological group (G, τ) is reﬂexive if αG is a topological isomorphism.

Deﬁnition 1.6 Let τ, ν be two group topologies on a group G. We say that τ and ν are compatible if algebraically (G, τ)∧ =
(G, ν)∧.

Now we include the deﬁnition of quasi-convex set, which emulates the Hahn-Banach Theorem from Functional Analysis:

Deﬁnition 1.7 [16]

Let (G, τ) be a topological group and let M ⊂ G be a subset. We say that M is quasi-convex if for every x ∈ G \ M, there
exists χ ∈ G∧ such that χ(M) ⊂ T+ and χ(x) < T+. We say that τ is locally quasi-convex if there exists a neighborhood basis for
τ consisting of quasi-convex subsets. We denote by Lqc the class of all locally quasi-convex topological groups.

Deﬁnition 1.8 Let τ be a group topology. We deﬁne the locally quasi-convex modiﬁcation of τ as the ﬁnest locally quasi-convex
group topology (τ)lqc among all those satisfying that they are coarser than τ.

For a deeper insight in the locally quasi-convex modiﬁcation of a topological group, see [9].

Lemma 1.9 Let (G, τ) be a topological group. Then (G, τ)∧ = (G, (τ)lqc)∧.

Deﬁnition 1.10 Let (G, τ) a topological group. The polar of a subset S ⊂ G is deﬁned as

Remark 1.11 It is clear that

S ⊲ := {χ ∈ G∧ | χ(S ) ⊂ T+}.

(G, τ)∧ = [V∈B

V ⊲,

where B is a neighborhood basis of 0 for the topology τ.

Deﬁnition 1.12 [11]

Let G be a class of abelian topological groups and let (G, τ) be a topological group in G. Let CG(G, τ) denote the family of all
G-topologies ν on G compatible with τ. We say that µ ∈ CG(G, τ) is the G-Mackey topology for (G, G∧) (or the Mackey topology
for (G, τ) in G) if ν ≤ µ for all ν ∈ CG(G, τ).

If G is the class of locally quasi-convex groups Lqc, we will simply say that the topology is Mackey.

The problem whether the Mackey Topology for a topological group (G, τ) exists was ﬁrst posed in [7]. This problem is
called the Mackey Problem. Along the last years several mathematicians have tried to solve the Mackey Problem: de Leo [8],
Aussenhofer, Dikranjan, Mart´ın-Peinador [3], D´ıaz-Nieto [9], Gabriyelyan [10]. A survey including similarities and diﬀerences
between the Mackey topology in spaces and the Mackey Problem for groups has recently appeared [13]. In order to solve the
Mackey Problem (in the negative) we try to ﬁnd all the locally quasi-convex group topologies which are compatible with a non-
discrete linear topology on Z and study if the supremum of all these topologies is again compatible. So far, it is not known if the
supremum of compatible topologies is again compatible.

Now we give the basic deﬁnitions on D-sequences, which are sequences of natural numbers that encode the relevant informa-

tion of non-discrete linear topologies on Z.

Deﬁnition 1.13 A sequence of natural numbers b = (bn)n∈N0 ∈ NN0 is called a D-sequence if it satisﬁes:

(1) b0 = 1,

(2) bn , bn+1 for all n ∈ N0,

(3) bn divides bn+1 for all n ∈ N0.

The following notation will be used in the sequel:

• D := {b : b is a D − sequence}.

• D∞ := {b ∈ D : bn+1
bn
∞ := {b ∈ D : bn+ℓ
bn

• Dℓ

→ ∞}.

→ ∞}.

• D∞(b) := {c : c is a subsequence of b and c ∈ D∞}.

• Dℓ

∞(b) := {c : c is a subsequence of b and c ∈ Dℓ

∞}.

Our interest on D-sequences stems from the fact that several compatible topologies on Z can be associated to D-sequences.
This family of topologies is interesting due to the fact that we don’t know in general, if the supremum of compatible topologies is
again compatible. This is the main diﬀerence between the study of the Mackey Topology in spaces and the Mackey Problem for
groups.

Deﬁnition 1.14 Let b be a D-sequence. Deﬁne (qn)n∈N by qn := bn
bn−1

.

Deﬁnition 1.15 Let b be a D-sequence. We say that

(a) b has bounded ratios if there exists a natural number N, satisfying that qn =

bn
bn−1

≤ N.

(b) b is basic if qn is a prime number for all n ∈ N.

Deﬁnition 1.16 Let b be a D-sequence. We write

Z(bn) := ( k

bn

+ Z : k = 0, 1, . . . , bn − 1) and Z(b∞) := [n∈N0

Z(bn).

As quotient groups, we can write

Z(bn) = *( 1

bn)+ /Z and Z(b∞) = *( 1

bm

: m ∈ N0)+ /Z.

In other words, Z(bn) consists of the elements whose order divides bn and Z(b∞) is generated by the elements having order bn for
some natural number n ∈ N0.

Proposition 1.17 Let b be a D-sequence. Suppose that q j+1 , 2 for inﬁnitely many j. For each integer number L ∈ Z, there exists
a natural number N = N(L) and unique integers k0, . . . , kN, such that:

The proof of Proposition 1.17 can be found in [4, Proposition 2.2.1] and [5, Proposition 1.4]

Deﬁnition 1.18 The family

Bb := {bnZ : n ∈ N0}

is a neighborhood basis of 0 for a linear (that is, it has a neighborhood basis consisting in open subgroups) group topology on Z,
which will be called b-adic topology and is denoted by λb.

This topology is precompact. In [2], it is proved that (Z, λb)∧ = Z(b∞) and the following

Lemma 1.19 Let b be a D-sequence. Then bn → 0 in λb.

Deﬁnition 1.20 A D-sequence b in Z induces in a natural way a sequence in T. Namely, for a D-sequence, b = (bn)n∈N0, deﬁne

b :=   1

bn

+ Z : n ∈ N0! ⊂ T.

Denote by τb the topology of uniform convergence on b.

2 Killing λb null sequences.

In this section we prove that for a D sequence, b with bounded ratios and any λb convergent sequence, (an), there exists a strictly
ﬁner compatible topology (constructed as a topology of uniform convergence on a suitable sequence in D∞(b)) such that the
ﬁxed sequence (an) is no longer convergent. This will allow us to ﬁnd a locally quasi-convex topology which has no convergent
sequences, but it is still compatible.

Theorem 2.1 Let b be a basic D-sequence with bounded ratios and let (xn) ⊂ Z be a non-quasiconstant sequence such that
λb
→ 0. Then there exists a metrizable locally quasi-convex compatible group topology τ(= τc for some subsequence c of b) on Z
xn
satisfying:

(a) τ is compatible with λb.
τ
(b) xn
9 0.
(c) λb < τ.

Proof:

We deﬁne τ as the topology of uniform convergence on a subsequence c of b, which we construct by means of the claim:

Claim 2.2 Since b is a D-sequence with bounded ratios, there exists L ∈ N such that qn+1 ≤ L for all n ∈ N.

We can construct inductively two sequences (n j), (m j) ⊂ N such that

n j+1 − n j > j and

xm j
bn j+1

+ Z < TL.

Proof of the claim:
j = 1.
Choose n1 ∈ N such that there exists xm1, satisfying bn1 | xm1 but bn1+1 ∤ xm1. By Proposition 1.17, we write

The condition bn1 | xm1 implies ki = 0 if i < n1 and bn1+1 ∤ xm1 implies kn1 , 0.

Suppose we have n j, m j satisfying the desired conditions. Let n j+1 ≥ n j + j be a natural number such that there exists xm j+1

satisfying bn j+1 | xm j+1 and bn j+1+1 ∤ xm j+1. By Proposition 1.17, we write

The condition bn j+1 | xm j+1 implies that ki = 0 if i < n j+1 and bn j+1+1 ∤ xm j+1 implies kn j+1 , 0.

We continue the proof of Theorem 2.1. Consider now c = (cid:16)bn j+1(cid:17) j∈N

. Let

c = ( 1

bn j+1

+ Z : j ∈ N)

and let τ = τc be the topology of uniform convergence on c. Then:

(1) By Proposition [2, Remark 3.3], τ is metrizable and locally quasi-convex. By [2, Proposition 3.7], we have λb < τ.

(2) By the claim, we have proved that xm j

j→∞
9 0 in τ. This implies that xn 9 0 in τ.

(3) Since n j+1 ≥ n j + j, we get that n j+1 − n j ≥ j. Thus,

3 The topology Γb.

In Section 2, we use a subfamily of D∞(b) to eliminate all λb convergent sequences. Unfortunately, this subfamily depends on
the choices made in Theorem 2.1. This is why we introduce a new topology Γb, which is the supremmum of the topologies of
uniform convergence on sequences in D∞(b). The topology Γb is well-deﬁned (in the sense that it does not depend on the choices
made in Theorem 2.1).

Deﬁnition 3.1 Let b be a basic D-sequence with bounded ratios. We deﬁne on Z the topology

Γb := sup{τc : c ∈ D∞(b)}.

Now we set some results on Γb:

Remark 3.2 Since D∞(b) is no-empty, we have that λb < Γb.

5

Theorem 3.3 Let b a basic D-sequence with bounded ratios. Then the topology Γb has no nontrivial convergent sequences.
Hence, it is not metrizable.

Proof:

λb

Since every Γb-convergent sequence is λb-convergent, we consider only λb-convergent sequences. Let (xn) ⊆ Z be a sequence
→ 0. By Proposition 2.1, there exists a subsequence (bnk)k satisfying that τ(bnk ) is a locally quasi-convex topology,
Γb
9 0. Hence, the only convergent sequences in Γb are the trivial

such that xn
(bnk) ∈ D∞(b) and xn
ones. Since Γb has no nontrivial convergent sequences, it is not metrizable.

τbnk
9 0. Since τbnk

≤ Γb, we know that xn

Corollary 3.4 Let p = (pn). Then Γp has no nontrivial convergent sequences.

Lemma 3.5 Let b be a D-sequence. Then (Z, Γb)∧ = Z(b∞).

For the proof of Lemma 3.5 we need the following deﬁnition of [4]:

Deﬁnition 3.6 [4, Deﬁnition 4.4.4]

Let b be a basic D-sequence with bounded ratios. We deﬁne on Z the topology

δb := sup{τc : c ∈ Dℓ

∞(b)}.

Proof of Lemma 3.5:

Since λb < Γb, it is clear that Z(b∞) ≤ (Z, Γb)∧.
By deﬁnition, it is clear that Γb ≤ δb. Hence (Z, Γb)∧ ≤ (Z, δb)∧ = Z(b∞).

Now we set some interesting questions related to the Mackey Problem and Γb:

Open question 3.7 Is Γb = δb?

Open question 3.8 Is Γb (or δb, if diﬀerent) the Mackey topology for (Z, λb)?

QED

The following lemmas are easy to prove, even for a topological space instead of a topological group.

Lemma 3.9 Let K be a countably inﬁnite compact subset of a Hausdorﬀ space. Then K is ﬁrst countable, and, hence, every
accumulation point in K is the limit point of some sequence.

Proof:

Let K = {xn, n ∈ N}. Fix a ∈ K. Consider for each xn ∈ K a closed neighborhood of a (this is possible because K is regular)

say Vn ⊂ X \ xn. The set {Vn, n ∈ N} and its ﬁnite intersections constitute a neighborhood basis for a ∈ K.

In fact, if W is any open neighborhood of a, we have a family of closed sets given by {X \W, Vn, n ∈ N} with empty intersection.
Since K is compact, the mentioned family cannot have the ﬁnite intersection property. Thus, there is a ﬁnite subfamily {V j, j ∈ F}
such that (X \ W) ∩i∈F Vi = ∅.

QED

Lemma 3.10 If a countable topological group G has no nontrivial convergent sequences, then it does not have inﬁnite compact
subsets either.

Proof:

Suppose, by contradiction, that K ⊂ G is an inﬁnite compact subset. Since K is ﬁrst countable and Hausdorﬀ, any accumulation
point is the limit of a sequence in K. SinceK is inﬁnite and compact, it has an accumulation point, contradicting the fact that there
does not exist convergent sequences in G (nor in K). Hence any compact subset must be ﬁnite.

QED

Proposition 3.11 Let b be a basic D-sequence with bounded ratios, then the group G = (Z, Γb) is not reﬂexive. In fact, the bidual
G∧∧ can be identiﬁed with Z endowed with the discrete topology.

6

Proof:

The dual group of (Z, Γb) has supporting set Z(b∞). The Γb-compact subsets of Z are ﬁnite by Lemma 3.10, therefore, the dual
group carries the pointwise convergence topology. Thus, G∧ is exactly Z(b∞) with the topology induced by the euclidean of T.
By [1, 4.5], the group Z(b∞) has the same dual group as T, namely, Z with the discrete topology. We conclude that the canonical
mapping αG is an open non-continuous isomorphism.

QED

Corollary 3.12 Since (Z, Γb)∧∧ is discrete, the homomorphism α(Z,Γb) is not continuous. However, it is an open algebraic isomor-
phism.

Proposition 3.13 Let b ∈ Dℓ

∞ and Gγ := (Z, τb). Then αGγ is a non-surjective embedding from Gγ into G∧∧
γ .

Proof:

Since τb is metrizable, αGγ is continuous. The fact that τb is locally quasi-convex and Z(b∞) separates points of Z imply that
αGγ is injective and open in its image [1, 6.10]. On the other hand, αGγ is not onto, for otherwise Gγ would be reﬂexive. However,
a non-discrete countable metrizable group cannot be reﬂexive. Indeed, the dual of a metrizable group is a k-space ([1, 6]) and the
dual group of a k-space is complete. Hence, the original group must be complete as well. By Baire Category Theorem, the only
metrizable complete group topology on a countable group is the discrete one.

QED

4 The complete topology T{bn}.

In this section we consider some special families of topologies which were introduced by Graev and deeply studied in the group
of the integers by Protasov and Zelenyuk ([14, 15]). We need ﬁrst some deﬁnitions about sequences. All sequences considered
will be without repeated terms.

Deﬁnition 4.1 Let G be a group and g = (gn) ⊂ G a sequence of elements of G. We say that g is a T -sequence if there exists a
Hausdorﬀ group topology τ such that gn

τ
→ 0.

Lemma 4.2 Let g ⊂ G be a T -sequence, then there exists the ﬁnest group topology T{gn} satisfying that gn

T{gn}
→ 0.

Since we can describe T{gn} we are interested in ﬁnding a suitable neighborhood basis for this topology.

Deﬁnition 4.3 [15]

Let G be a group and let a = (an) be a T -sequence in G and (ni)i∈N a sequence of natural numbers. We deﬁne:

• A∗

m := {±an|n ≥ m} ∪ {0G}.

• A(k, m) := {g0 + · · · + gk|gi ∈ A∗

m i ∈ {0, . . . , k}}.

• [n1, . . . , nk] := {g1 + · · · + gk : gi ∈ A∗

ni , i = 1, . . . , k}.

• V(ni) =

∞

[n1, . . . , nk].

[k=1

Proposition 4.4 The family {V(ni) : (ni) ∈ NN} is a neighborhood basis of 0G for a group topology T{an } on G, which is the ﬁnest
among all those satisfying an → 0. The symbol G{an} will stand for the group G endowed with T{an}.

Next, we include a theorem of great interest from [15]:

Theorem 4.5 [15, Theorem 2.3.11]

Let (gn) be a T -sequence on a group G. Then, the topology T{gn} is complete.

Corollary 4.6 Let b be a D-sequence and c ∈ Dℓ

∞(b). Then τc , T{bn}.

Applying the Baire Category Theorem, we can obtain the following corollary:

7

Corollary 4.7 Let G be a countable group. For any T -sequence g, the topology T{gn } is not metrizable.

Since we are mainly interested on topologies on the group of integers, we include the following results:

Proposition 4.8 [15, Theorem 2.2.1]

If limn→∞

an+1
an

= ∞ then (an) is a T -sequence in Z.

This proposition provides a condition to prove that the following sequences are T -sequences: (bn) = (2n2), (ρn) = (p1 · · · · · pn).

Proposition 4.9 [15, Theorem 2.2.3]

If limn→∞

an+1
an

= r and r is a transcendental number then (an) is a T -sequence in Z.

Let b be a D-sequence. It is clear (by Lemma 1.19) that b is a T -sequence. Hence, the topology T{bn} can be constructed on Z.

By Theorem 4.5, it is a complete topology.

The following properties of Z{an} are interesting by themselves. The ﬁrst one solves a problem by Malykhin and the second

one states that the dual group is metrizable and a k-space.

Remark 4.10 Let (an) be a T -sequence on Z. Then:

(1) Z{an} is sequential, but not Frechet-Urysohn ([14, Theorem 7 and Theorem 6]).

(2) Z{an} is a kω-group ([15, Corollary 4.1.5] ).

We prove now that, for a D-sequence b with bounded ratios, the locally quasi-convex modiﬁcation of T{bn} is λb. This fact is

also proved in [10, Proposition 2.5], but we give here a direct proof. First we study some numerical results in the group T:

Lemma 4.11 Let k ∈ T and m ∈ N satisfy k, 2k, . . . , mk ∈ T+. If mk ∈ Tn, then k ∈ Tnm.

Proposition 4.14 Let b be a D-sequence with bounded ratios and V(ni) a basic neighborhood of T{bn}. Then, there exists N ∈ N
such that

A := {bN, 2bN, . . . , bN+1, 2bN+1, . . . , bN+2, 2bN+2, . . . } ∈ V(ni).

As a consequence V ⊲

(ni) are ﬁnite subsets of T, for any sequence (ni).

Proof:

Since b has bounded ratios, there exists L ∈ N such that qn ≤ L for all n ∈ N.
Let n1, n2, . . . , nL be the indexes satisfying that ni ≤ n j if i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , L} and j < {1, 2, . . . , L}. Let N := max{n1, n2, . . . , nL}.

Then bN , bN+1, · · · ∈ A∗

ni for i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , L} and

A ⊂ {bN , 2bN, . . . , LbN , bN+1, 2bN+1, . . . , LbN+1, . . . } ⊂ [n1, n2, . . . , nL] ⊂ V(ni).

Let χ ∈ V ⊲

(ni). Since A ⊂ V(ni), it is clear that V ⊲

(ni) ⊂ A⊲. Deﬁne k := χ(bN). Then χ(A) = {k, 2k, . . . qNk, 2qNk, . . . , qNqN+1k, . . . }.

Since χ ∈ A⊲, we have χ(A) ⊂ T+. By Lemma 4.13, the fact k = χ(bN) = 0 + Z follows. Hence χ ∈ Z(bN) and V ⊲

(ni) is ﬁnite.

QED

Finally, we can prove that for a D-sequence, b, with bounded ratios, the locally quasi-convex modiﬁcation of T{bn} is λb.

Corollary 4.15 Let b be a D-sequence with bounded ratios. Then Z∧

{bn} = Z(b∞).

Proof:

Since Z{bn} = S(ni) V ⊲
Since b → 0 in λb, λb ≤ T{bn} and Z∧

(ni), we have that Z∧

{bn} ≤ Z(b∞).

{bn} ≥ Z(b∞).

QED

Theorem 4.16 Let b a D-sequence with bounded ratios. Then the locally quasi-convex modiﬁcation of T{bn} is λb.

Proof:

Since the polar sets of the basic neighborhoods of T{bn} are ﬁnite, the equicontinuous subsets in the dual group are ﬁnite as
well. Hence the locally quasi-convex modiﬁcation of T{bn} is precompact. Since T{bn } and its locally quasi-convex modiﬁcation

are compatible topologies, it follows that(cid:0)T{bn}(cid:1)lqc = λb.

Corollary 4.17 Let b a D-sequence with bounded ratios. Then T{bn} is not locally quasi-convex.

Proof:

If T{bn} were locally quasi-convex, then(cid:0)T{bn}(cid:1)lqc = T{bn}, but(cid:0)T{bn}(cid:1)lqc is not complete and T{bn } is complete.

QED

QED

Remark 4.18 Although the examples in Corollary 4.17 are not locally quasi-convex, there exists examples of Graev-type topolo-
gies on Z which are locally quasi-convex. Indeed, in [12] it is proved that there exist Graev-type topologies on Z which are
reﬂexive (hence locally quasi-convex).

Remark 4.19 Corollary 4.17 gives a family of examples of:

• Complete topologies whose locally quasi-convex modiﬁcations are not complete.

• Non-metrizable topologies whose locally quasi-convex modiﬁcations are metrizable.

Proposition 4.20 The dual group of Z{bn} coincides algebraically and topologically with the dual group of (Z, λb); that is, the
dual group of Z{bn} is Z(b∞) endowed with the discrete topology.

Proof:

From Corollary 4.15 the dual group of Z{bn} is Z∧
complete. By Baire Category Theorem and since Z∧
with (Z, λb)∧.

{bn} = Z(b∞). Item (2) in Remark 4.10 implies that Z∧
{bn} is metrizable and
{bn} is countable, we get that it is discrete. Hence, it coincides topologically

QED

Now we answer the question whether Z{bn} is MAP-Mackey.

Proposition 4.21 The topology Z{bn} is not MAP-Mackey.

Proof:

If T{bn } were Mackey, the condition Γb ≤ T{bn } should hold. But, the topology Γb has no convergent sequences and bn → 0 in

T{bn}.

QED

Open question 4.22 Let (gn) a T -sequence in Z. If T{gn} is locally quasi-convex, is T{gn} the Mackey Topology?
