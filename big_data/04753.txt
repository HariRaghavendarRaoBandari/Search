Non-local reaction kinetics and localization in ﬂuctuating environments

(Dated: March 16, 2016)

We study reaction and diﬀusion dynamics subject to both physical and chemical ﬂuctuations
with broad distributions of diﬀusion and reaction time scales. The particle density transitions
from subdiﬀusion to localization and the total density decays as a power, with both quantities
depending on both transport and reaction parameters. The density obeys a fractional reaction-
diﬀusion equation with memory kernels that manifest this strong coupling between microscopic
physical and chemical ﬂuctuations. This system provides a possible cause for non-local kinetics and
thus memory reactions.

Reaction-diﬀusion systems in ﬂuctuating environments
develop collective behaviors due to the interaction of
diﬀusion and reaction mechanisms that may be very
diﬀerent from those occurring under well mixed condi-
tions. Smoluchowski’s theory [1] quantiﬁes the interac-
tion of diﬀusion and reaction for a fast bimolecular reac-
tion through an eﬀective rate that is proportional to the
molecular diﬀusion coeﬃcient. This approach is valid
under well-mixed conditions. Spatial and temporal ﬂuc-
tuations may lead to the segregation of the reactants [2]
characterized by non-Poissonian encounter processes and
broad ﬁrst-passage time distributions [3], such that reac-
tion kinetics on small and large scales may be very dif-
ferent [4]. The sound understanding and quantiﬁcation
of the interaction of the reaction and ﬂuctuation mech-
anisms play a central role in applications as diverse as
contaminant degradation and chemical transformations
in geological media [5, 6] and chemical kinetics in crowded
intracellular environments [7].

In this paper, we investigate the eﬀective reaction dy-
namics in an environment undergoing both physical and
chemical ﬂuctuations characterized by broad distribu-
tions of transport and reaction times scales. The phys-
ical picture is a random walker decaying at rates that
are aﬀected by environmental factors that ﬂuctuate on
the same scale as the mechanisms that lead to heavy
tailed transition time distributions and thus subdiﬀu-
sion. For a single homogeneous decay rate, the particle
distribution or survival probability decays exponentially
in time [8–10]. The reaction kinetics are not aﬀected
by physical ﬂuctuations and follow Poissonian dynam-
ics. In the opposite case of instantaneous spatially dis-
tributed traps, the eﬀective reaction behavior as quan-
tiﬁed by the survival probability is fully determined by
the transport characteristics [11–13].( See also Ref. [14].)
Here we study the interaction of ﬂuctuations in tran-
sition and reaction times, and the resulting reaction-
diﬀusion dynamics, with speciﬁc emphasis on the reac-
tion kinetics. A number of approaches have been pro-
posed to model reaction behaviors in heterogeneous en-
vironments, including fractional kinetic orders and time-

dependent rate coeﬃcients [15, 16] as well as delay re-
action equations [7, 17–19]. Oftentimes, eﬀective kinetic
equations to explain non-exponential survival probabil-
ities are phenomenology-based lumped parameter mod-
els [20]. Here we elucidate explicit physical and chemical
ﬂuctuation mechanisms that lead to anomalous chemical
kinetics, and identify and quantify the resulting collective
transport and reaction dynamics.

Reaction-diﬀusion in ﬂuctuating environments— We
consider non-interacting particles of a chemical species A
that perform an unbiased one-dimensional random walk
and at the same time undergo the reaction A r→ ∅ with
random reaction rate r. During the nth step, a live par-
ticle undergoes a spatial translation of random length ξn
during a random time τn and decays with random rate
rn. The position xn and time tn are given by

xn = xn−1 + ξn,

tn = tn−1 + τn,

n > 0.

(1)

The particle survives the nth transition with probabil-
ity exp(−rnτn). We denote the common joint prob-
ability density function (PDF) for each (ξn, τn, rn) by
ψ(ξ, τ, r) = ψ(ξ, τ )ρ(r) = ψ(τ )φ(ξ)ρ(r), where we have
deﬁned ψ(ξ, τ ) for convenience. We denote by angular
brackets averages with respect to both ψ(ξ, τ, r) as well
as the product of copies for all steps. The corresponding
r ρ(τ−1
reaction times τr = 1/r have PDF ψr(τr) = τ−2
).
Equation (1) constitutes a continuous time random walk
(CTRW) [21–24] subject to random decay.

r

The particle density p(x, t) of surviving particles at
spatial coordinate x at time t is given by p(x, t) =
(cid:104)δ(x − xnt) exp[−rnt(t − tnt)](cid:105)(cid:105), where nt = sup(n|tn ≤
t). The normalized mean square displacement m(t) of
the surviving particles is given by the second cumu-
lant m(t) = −d2 ln p(k = 0, t)/dk2, where p(k, t) is the
Fourier transform of p(x, t), with wave number k.
In
the following, Fourier and Laplace transforms are dis-
tinguished from their space and time equivalents by the
arguments k and s. The survival probability p(t) of a
particle is equal to the spatially integrated particle den-
sity p(t) = p(k = 0, t). Its evolution describes the eﬀec-
tive chemical kinetics and reaction dynamics. We refer

In this limit, reaction and diﬀusion separate and the re-
action kinetics is described simply by a single rate: the

Anomalous kinetics and localization— Figure 1 illus-
trates the survival probability p(t) and the mean square
displacement m(t) for a heavy tailed transition time PDF
that behaves as ψ(t) ∝ τ−1−α with α < 1, for t larger
than a characteristic time τ0, and a rate distribution
which behaves as ρ(r) ∝ rν−1 with ν > 0 for r smaller
than a characteristic rate r0. This means that the distri-
bution of reaction times scales as ψr(τr) ∝ τ−1−ν
for τr
larger than r−1
0 . We observe two remarkable behaviors.
Firstly, the survival probability decays as a power-law
p(t) ∝ t−γ, where γ = α + ν, and secondly m(t) increases
as for passive particles until a characteristic reaction time
scale after which it decays towards a constant. This in-
dicates localization of the particle distribution.

system and analyze in detail the anomalous reaction be-
havior and localization of the particle distribution.

The reaction dynamics are non-local in time instead of
non-linear as assumed by kinetic rate laws such as (2).
The reaction kinetics depend in general on the diﬀusion
history as expressed through the reaction kernel (5).

Weak coupling— By weak coupling we mean the reac-
tion kinetics are not aﬀected by transport and the distri-
bution of surviving particles is not aﬀected by reaction.
In this case, we write the particle density as

p(x, t) = exp(−(cid:104)r(cid:105)t)p0(x, t),

(7)

where p0(x, t) is the density of non-reacting particles.
Weak coupling occurs if diﬀusion is asymptotically nor-
mal, that is, the mean transition time (cid:104)τ(cid:105) < ∞.
In
this case, the reaction and diﬀusion kernels simplify for
t (cid:29) (cid:104)τ(cid:105) to

Weak coupling also occurs if there is only a single reaction
rate, that is ρ(r) = δ(r − r0). In this case, the reaction
and diﬀusion kernels are given by

Kr(s) = r0,

ϕ(x, s) = ϕ0(x, s + r0),

(10)
where ϕ0(x, s) = sψ(x, s)/[1 − ψ(s)]. This gives the gen-
eralized reaction-diﬀusion Master equation

Note that a heavy tailed waiting time distribution gives
a non-local kernel in (11), as discussed in Ref. [8].

In both these weak coupling scenarios, the particle den-
sity is of the form (7). This means that there is no local-
ization of the particle density and the reaction kinetics
are not aﬀected by diﬀusion in any way. The survival
probability p(t) satisﬁes the ﬁrst-order rate equation

dp(t)

dt

= −(cid:104)r(cid:105)p(t).

(12)

The eﬀective reaction kinetics are fully determined by
the characteristic reaction rate. Note that this behavior
is also observed at short times, that is, at times shorter
than a characteristic reaction time scale r−1
0 . In this case,
the reaction kernel also reduces to Kr(s) = (cid:104)r(cid:105). This is
obtained from (5) by considering the limit s (cid:29) r0. Strong
coupling— We now analyze the more interesting case of
strong coupling between reaction and diﬀusion that gives
rise to anomalous mesoscopic kinetics. Thus, we employ
a heavy tailed transition time PDF ψ(τ ) that behaves as

ψ(τ ) ∝

α

τmΓ(1−α)

(t/τm)−1−α,

0 < α < 1,

(13)

for times larger than the microscopic time scale τm. We
also assume that δ = (cid:104)ξ2(cid:105) is ﬁnite. Under these con-
ditions, the Laplace transform of (13) for sτm (cid:28) 1 is
given by ψ(s) ≈ 1 − (sτm)α. Likewise, the Fourier trans-
form of φ(ξ) can be approximated for k (cid:28) δ−1/2 as
φ(k) ≈ 1 − δk2/2, so that the joint PDF is ψ(k, s) =
1 − δk2/2 − (sτm)α.
In the scaling limit δ → 0 and τm → 0 such that
Dα = δ2/(2τ α
m) remains ﬁnite, we obtain the non-local

The simple density ρ(r) = (1/2)[δ(r) + δ(r − r0)] already
shows strong coupling. But, here we focus on the more

This inextricable coupling of diﬀusion and reaction is al-
ready evident in the reaction and diﬀusion kernels in (15).
Anomalous kinetics— The kinetic equation (6) is con-
veniently solved in Laplace space. Using the reaction
kernel (15), we obtain the compact expression

p(s) = (cid:104)(s + r)α−1(cid:105)/(cid:104)(s + r)α(cid:105).

(19)

As mentioned earlier, at short times t < r−1
0 , the sur-
vival probability is approximately exponential, p(t) ≈
exp(−(cid:104)r(cid:105)t). For times t > r−1
0 , and all ν > 0, we ob-
tain by inversion of p(s) the form [25]

p(t) ∝ t−α−ν

0 < α < 1,

ν > 0.

(20)

Thus, as anticipated in the deﬁnition of the fractional-
order derivative of (17), the exponent observed in Fig. 1
is given by γ = α + ν, which manifests again the intimate
coupling of diﬀusion and reaction mechanisms.
In the limit α → 0, the particles never moves, so the
survival probability is just given by p(t) = (cid:104)exp(−rt)(cid:105),
which, for ρ(r) in (16), gives the decay p(t) ∝ tν. In the
limit ν → 0, all the weight of ρ(r) becomes concentrated
on zero and the particle does not decay. The decay ap-
proaches p(t) ∝ t−α, but the timescale of the onset of
decay also tends to ∞. The dependence of p(t) on α and
ν is illustrated in Fig. 2.

Localization— Localization in the strong coupling sce-
nario is evident in the normalized mean square displace-
ment m(t) and the normalized particle density c(x, t) =
p(x, t)/p(t). Notice that in the weakly coupled case
p(x, t) = exp(−(cid:104)r(cid:105)t)p0(x, t) where p0(x, t) is the particle
distribution in the absence of reaction. Thus, c(x, t) =
p0(x, t). There is evidently no localization for weak cou-
pling, and m(t) evolves exactly as in the non-reactive
case. For the strong coupling scenarios, m(t) tends to a
constant as illustrated in Fig. 1. We obtain from (14) the
Laplace space solution

FIG. 3. Normalized particle density c(x, t) with ψ(τ ) and
ρ(r) as in Fig. 1, and t = 1 (black), 8.6 (yellow), 106 (blue).
The curve for t = 106 is indistinguishable in this plot from
the asymptotic distribution (22). The inset shows the same
curves on a semi-log scale. Curves are obtained from numer-
ical inversion of (21).

As outlined above, for t < r−1
0 , the survival probabil-
ity is approximately exponential and thus the propa-
gator p(x, t) ≈ exp(−(cid:104)r(cid:105)t)p0(x, t). The density p0(x, t)
of non-reactive particles is obtained from (21) by set-
ting Kr(s) ≡ 0. Thus m(t) evolves as in the non-
reactive case, that is m(t) ∝ Dαtα. (See Fig. 1.) For
times t (cid:29) r−1
0 , (21) can be be approximated by [25]

p(x, s) ≈ p(s) exp(−|x|(cid:112)(cid:104)rα(cid:105)/Dα)/(cid:112)4Dα/(cid:104)rα(cid:105). Thus,

the normalized density c(x, t) localizes and we obtain

(22)

t→∞ c(x, t) = exp (−|x|/l)/(2l),

lim

0 , m(t) = Dατ α

the localization length l = (cid:112)Dατ α

where we deﬁned the localization time τl = (cid:104)rα(cid:105)−1/α and
l . We obtain in the
limit t (cid:29) r−1
α = l2. The localization time
τl marks the scale at which the mean square displacement
crosses over from the power-law behavior m(t) ∝ Dαtα
to the constant value as illustrated in Fig. 1. Figure 3
shows the normalized particle density c(x, t) at diﬀerent
times. We clearly observe localization as a result of the
interaction of reaction and subdiﬀusion.

Lower cut-oﬀ in rate density— Suppose we shift ρ(r)
by rc so that the probability that r < rc is zero. That
is, we set ρc(r) = ρ(r − rc)Θ(r − rc). This amounts to
replacing r by r + rc in p(x, t) = (cid:104)δ(x− xnt) exp[−rnt(t−
tnt)](cid:105)(cid:105). Thus,

pc(x, t) = exp(−rct)p(x, t).

(23)

Note that this leaves c(x, t) unchanged, so that, if ρ(r)
leads to localization, then so does ρc(r). However, the
asymptotic survival probability (20) decays not with the
mean rate (cid:104)r(cid:105) as in the weakly coupled case, but rather
with the smallest rate. For instance, for the power law
ρ(r) (16) and rc (cid:28) r0 the survival probability follows a
truncated power law pc(t) ∝ exp(−rct)t−α−ν.

Conclusions— In conclusion, we ﬁnd that incomplete
mixing of reacting particles in a ﬂuctuating environment
resulting from a broad distribution of transition times
and heterogeneity in the chemical properties can lead to
anomalous memory reactions and localization of the par-
ticle density. For strong coupling between the physical
and chemical ﬂuctuations, we observe anomalous reac-
tion kinetics, which manifest here in a power-law decay
of the survival probability. The reaction kinetics can-
not be represented by a non-linear, or fractal eﬀective
rate law, but are intrinsically non-local, which means the
reactions have memory. The reaction memory kernel is
determined by both the physical and chemical system
parameters, which emphasizes the intrinsic coupling be-
tween subdiﬀusion and reaction mechanisms. This is also
reﬂected in the spatial particle density, which localizes.
The evolution of the particle density is described in gen-
eral by a non-local subdiﬀusion-reaction equation which,
for heavy tailed reaction time densities reduces to a frac-
tional diﬀusion-reaction equation and gives rise to frac-
tional reaction kinetics. These results shed light on the
possible origins of anomalous reaction behaviors and the
microscopic mechanisms that lead to non-local reaction
kinetics.

Supplemental Material

In this supplemental material, we detail the calculations that lead to the fractional reaction-diﬀusion equation,
for the derivation of the power-law survival probability and the localization of the particle density. We employ the
transition time distribution

ψ(τ ) ∝

α

τmΓ(1−α)

(t/τm)−1−α,

0 < α < 1,

(S1)

for times larger than the microscopic time scale τm. We consider the rate distribution

ρ(r) ∝ ˆρ(r/r0)
r0Γ(ν)

(r/r0)ν−1,

ν > 0,

(S2)

where limz→0 ˆρ(z) = 1.

Here, we treat the case 0 < α + ν < 1 and show that, at long times, the non-local reaction-diﬀusion equation becomes
a fractional reaction-diﬀusion equation. This can be see by considering the kernels

Kr(s) =

(cid:104)r(s + r)α−1(cid:105)
s(cid:104)(s + r)α−1(cid:105) ,

Kd(s) =

1

s(cid:104)(s + r)α−1(cid:105) .

(S4)

for s < r−1
from the factor in the denominator (cid:104)(s + r)α−1(cid:105). Using (S2), we have

0 . In this limit the numerator in Kr(s) is approximately (cid:104)rα(cid:105). The fractional nature of the kernels comes

(cid:104)(s + r)α−1(cid:105) ∝

sα+ν−1
rν
0 Γ(ν)

(1 + z)α−1zν−1 ˆρ(sz/r0) dz

For small s/r0 (cid:28) 1, the last integral converges since the factor ˆρ(sz/r0) ≈ 1 while the remaining factors decay faster
than z−1. But, sα+ν−1 diverges. The integral can be evaluated, and we ﬁnd

0 sα+ν−1 Γ(1 − α − ν)
Γ(1 − α)
Thus, the reaction kernel Kr(s) ∝ (cid:104)rα(cid:105)rν
0 s−(α+ν) and Kd(s) ∝ rν
deﬁnitions of the fractional derivative of order 1 − (α + ν) in (S3).

for s/r0 (cid:28) 1.

In order to determine the scaling of the survival probability for t (cid:29) (cid:104)r(cid:105), we consider the Laplace space expression

Survival probability

p(s) =

(cid:104)(s + r)α−1(cid:105)
(cid:104)(s + r)α(cid:105)

for the survival probability. Even in the case that neither numerator nor denominator diverge as s → 0, we show that
the behavior in this limit is determined by the non-analyticity in the numerator. Now suppose k ≤ α + ν < k + 1,
with k = 0, 1, . . .. It is easy to see that all derivatives of (s + r)α−1 of order less than k tend to a constant as s → 0,
but the kth derivative diverges,

where (α − 1)(k) is the falling factorial. Again, for small s/r0, we have
Γ(1 − α − ν + k)

dk

dsk (cid:104)(s + r)α−1(cid:105) ∝ r−ν

0 sα+ν−k−1(α − 1)(k)

Γ(1 − α + k)

= (−1)ksα+ν−k−1 Γ(1 − α − ν + k)

,

Γ(1 − α)

where we have used (α − 1)(k) = (−1)k(α − 1)(k) and β(k)Γ(β) = Γ(β + k), where β(k) is the rising factorial. We then

invert, using L−1(cid:8)s−βΓ(β)(cid:9) = tβ−1, for β > 0 and L−1(cid:8)f (k)(s)(cid:9) = (−1)ktkf (t), where f (k)(s) is the kth derivative.

We ﬁnd

L−1(cid:8)(cid:104)(s + r)α−1(cid:105)(cid:9) ∝ (−1)2kr−ν

For s/r0 (cid:28) 1, the divergence occurs in p(s), as before, so that we can set (cid:104)(s + r)α(cid:105) ≈ (cid:104)rα(cid:105), which gives

p(x, s) ≈ p(s)

exp

The normalized particle density thus tends to a constant: It localizes.
