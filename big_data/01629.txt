ABSTRACT
The X-ray emission of η Carinae shows multiple features at various spatial and tem-
poral scales. The central constant emission (CCE) component is centred on the binary
and arises from spatial scales much smaller than the bipolar Homunculus nebula,
but likely larger than the central wind–wind collision region between the stars as it
does not vary over the ∼2–3 month X-ray minimum when it can be observed. Using
large-scale 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, we model both
the colliding-wind region between the stars, and the region where the secondary wind
collides with primary wind ejected from the previous periastron passage. The simula-
tions extend out to one hundred semimajor axes and make two limiting assumptions
(strong coupling and no coupling) about the inﬂuence of the primary radiation ﬁeld
on the secondary wind. We perform 3D radiative transfer calculations on the SPH
output to synthesize the X-ray emission, with the aim of reproducing the CCE spec-
trum. For the preferred primary mass-loss rate ˙MA ≈ 8.5× 10−4 M(cid:12) yr−1, the model
spectra well reproduce the observation as the strong- and no-coupling spectra bound
the CCE observation for longitude of periastron ω ≈ 252◦, and bound/converge on the
observation for ω ≈ 90◦. This suggests that η Carinae has moderate coupling between
the primary radiation and secondary wind, that both the region between the stars
and the comoving collision on the backside of the secondary generate the CCE, and
that the CCE cannot place constraints on the binary’s line of sight. We also discuss
comparisons with common X-ray ﬁtting parameters.

1 INTRODUCTION
η Carinae has been well observed in X-rays, providing im-
portant constraints on this complex binary system. Ex-
tensive monitoring by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer
(RXTE) found a strongly periodic X-ray ﬂux, indicating a
binary orbit, where in dramatic fashion the X-ray ﬂux plum-
mets for ∼ 2− 3 months around periastron passage (Corco-
ran 2005; Corcoran et al. 2010), consistent with the timing
of a multitude of spectral changes in other wavebands (e.g.
Damineli et al. 2008). The X-rays also provide some of the

best constraints on the secondary star in η Carinae’s or-
bit. It is not detected at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths
because the primary star is so bright, and because ground-
based spectra are contaminated by emission from the Ho-
munculus nebula. Additionally, the broad lines from the op-
tically thick wind of the primary, and the existence of mul-
tiple emission regions make it diﬃcult to measure and inter-
pret radial velocity variations. Since the primary wind speed
(420 km s−1; Groh et al. 2012) is much too low to produce
the hard X-rays observed, they must be related to the sec-
ondary star. From matching a single Chandra spectrum, Pit-
tard & Corcoran (2002) found that the secondary wind speed
and mass-loss rate are ∼ 3000 km s−1 and ∼ 10−5 M(cid:12) yr−1.

To match the X-ray light curve, Corcoran et al. (2001) in-
ferred the system to be highly eccentric (e∼ 0.9), which has
been conﬁrmed by more complex hydrodynamic and radia-
tive transfer modelling (Okazaki et al. 2008; Parkin et al.
2009; Parkin et al. 2011). X-rays also play an important role
in determining how the radiation ﬁelds of two stars drive
both winds (Parkin et al. 2011), and how the X-rays pro-
duced ionize one or both winds, thus changing the wind ac-
celerations and the collision dynamics (Soker & Behar 2006;
Parkin & Sim 2013). Furthermore, the X-ray emission can
be used to constrain the line of sight to the binary orbit
as the X-ray absorption looking through the primary wind
is much stronger than when looking through the secondary
wind (Okazaki et al. 2008).

The spatial and temporal variations of the X-ray emis-
sion range from essentially temporally constant emission
from beyond the Homunculus (Seward et al. 1979), to ﬂuctu-
ations every few days that are thought to arise from clumps
in the primary wind impacting the wind-wind collision re-
gion between the stars (Moﬀat & Corcoran 2009). The focus
of this work is the central constant emission (CCE) compo-
nent identiﬁed by Hamaguchi et al. (2007), and conﬁrmed in
Hamaguchi et al. (2014), with the Chandra X-ray Observa-
tory. The CCE is only observable over the ∼2-3-month X-ray
minimum when the colliding-wind X-ray emission produced
between the stars is diminished, so ‘constant’ refers to this
time-scale. The emission is spatially unresolvable to Chan-
dra indicating that the emission originates within 0.5 arcsec
≈ 1150 au of the central binary stars.

Hamaguchi et al. (2007) proposed three explanations
for the origin of the CCE: (1) inherent emission from em-
bedded wind shocks of one or both winds, (2) a fast, polar
ﬂow of the primary wind interacting with the Little Ho-
munculus, and/or (3) the secondary wind (either shocked
and then cooled, or unshocked) ﬂowing away from the sys-
tem and then colliding with circumstellar material farther
out. The ﬁrst two mechanisms are now ruled out, since ob-
servations during the 2009.0 and 2014.6 periastron passages
revealed a hot, kT >∼5 keV, component to the CCE (Ham-
aguchi et al. 2014; Hamaguchi & Corcoran 2015). The hy-
drodynamic simulations of Madura et al. (2013) provide a
framework for the third method; the X-ray emission could
come from the wind–wind collision between a shell of pri-
mary material ejected during the previous periastron pas-
sage and the secondary wind ejected during the current cy-
cle. Russell et al. (2011a,b) noted the seed of this interaction
when, just after periastron, the secondary star becomes com-
pletely embedded in primary wind, and therefore creates a
hot, post-periastron bubble as secondary wind shocks with
primary wind in all directions. This includes the comoving
shock of secondary wind catching up to primary wind on
the back side of the secondary star. Madura et al. (2013)
performed hydrodynamic simulations out to a much larger
volume (a hundred semimajor axes = 100a) and captured
this comoving shock over an orbital cycle, thus showing this
interaction is still occurring one cycle later and potentially
generates the CCE emission.

This work aims to model the CCE X-ray emission by
performing 3D X-ray radiative transfer calculations on large-
volume (r < 100a) hydrodynamic simulations of η Carinae.
Section 2 presents the hydrodynamic simulations, and Sec-
tion 3 details the radiative transfer calculations. We discuss

our results in Section 4 and present our conclusions in Sec-
tion 5.

2 SMOOTHED PARTICLE HYDRODYNAMICS

2.1 Method
We model the wind–wind structure of η Carinae by using a
3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code originally
developed by Benz (1990) and Bate et al. (1995), and ﬁrst
applied to a colliding wind system – η Carinae – in Okazaki
et al. (2008). The stars are described by sink particles (Bate
et al. 1995) that orbit each other while continuously ejecting
regular SPH particles to model the interacting stellar winds.
The current capabilities of the code, described more fully
in Russell (2013) and Madura et al. (2013), include radia-
tive cooling using the exact integration scheme (Townsend
2009)1, and accelerating the winds according to a β =1 ve-
locity law, v(r) = v∞(1− R/r)β , where v(r) is the velocity at
radius r, v∞ is the wind terminal velocity, and R is the stellar
radius. The acceleration is done in an ‘antigravity’ fashion2
– the winds ‘fall’ oﬀ their stars – using a radially varying
opacity κ(r) that is tuned to pair with the ﬂux F(r) to pro-
duce the acceleration grad(r) = κ(r)F(r)/c required for the β
velocity law, where c is the speed of light.

(1)

In a binary system that accounts for the radiation ﬁelds
of both stars, the total acceleration of a gas parcel from star
i with companion star j is
grad,i(ri) ∼ κi(ri)F(ri)ˆri + κi j(ri j)F(r j)ˆr j.
κi j determines how the radiation from star j aﬀects the wind
of star i. For systems such as η Carinae where the tem-
peratures of the stars are very diﬀerent, calculating κi j is
challenging since the peak in the temperature of the radia-
tion ﬁeld of star j is mismatched to the ionization states of
the wind of star i (see e.g. Parkin et al. 2009). As such,
three straightforward possibilities for the coupling exist:
κi j(ri j) = κi(ri) attaches the opacity to the wind properties,
κi j(ri j) = κ j(r j) sets the opacity to the radiation ﬁeld prop-
erties, and κi j = 0 means the radiation of star j does not
inﬂuence the wind of star i. These three possibilities span
the range of coupling strength and are referred to as the
strong coupling if κi j(ri j) = max(κi(ri),κ j(r j)), the weak cou-
pling if κi j(ri j) = min(κi(ri),κ j(r j)), and no coupling if κi j = 0.
If the strong coupling is chosen for the radiation of star j to
interact with the wind of star i, then the weak coupling is
chosen for the radiation of star i to interact with the wind
of star j.

1 To mimic the heating of the gas from the stars (e.g. Drew 1989),
the simulations impose a ﬂoor temperature of 10 kK. The winds
are injected at 35 kK, which is inconsequential for the both gas
dynamics and the comparison with observations since X-rays are
produced from much larger temperatures.
2 Attempts to implement CAK (Castor, Abbott & Klein 1975)
line-driving have been hampered by the noise in the velocity gra-
dient computation in the SPH code. Future work will explore a
higher order smoothing kernel – quintic spline instead of the cubic
spline used here – and a larger number of neighbours to reduce
this noise.

MNRAS 000, 1–14 (2016)

In the context of η Carinae, and in particular its X-
ray emission, we are predominantly concerned with the in-
ﬂuence of the much stronger primary radiation ﬁeld on the
secondary wind, and so will consider strong and weak in this
context. Since the radiation of the primary is much greater
than the secondary, and the terminal speed of the secondary
is much greater than the speed of the primary, κB(r) > κA(r)
where A and B stand for the primary and secondary, re-
spectively, so κi j(ri j) = κB(rB), i.e. the opacity couples to the
wind, is the strong coupling, while κi j(ri j) = κA(rA), i.e. the
opacity couples to the radiation ﬁeld, is the weak coupling.
The radiation of star j inﬂuencing the wind of star i goes
under the term ‘radiative inhibition’3 since it was originally
applied to the region between the stars where the radiation
ﬁeld of star j acts in the opposite direction of the ﬂow of the
wind of star i, thus inhibiting the acceleration of the wind of
star i along the direction towards star j (Stevens & Pollock
1994). For this work, however, the secondary wind on the
side opposite the primary (once it has a line of sight to the
primary star) will feel radiation from both the secondary
and primary stars in the same direction, thus accelerating
much (slightly) faster in the strong (weak) coupling case as
compared to no coupling. Therefore, as opposed to using
the terminology strong or weak radiative inhibition, we will
specify strong or weak (or no) coupling.

Radiative braking (Owocki & Gayley 1995; Gayley et al.
1997), wherein the radiation from the weak-wind star can
suddenly decelerate a stronger wind and prevent the strong
wind from otherwise impacting the weak-wind star, is not
incorporated since this requires implementing the full radia-
tive line force (Castor et al. 1975) due to radiative braking’s
non-radial nature. Based on the stellar, wind, and orbital
parameters of η Carinae in this work, a straightforward im-
plementation of the radiative braking requirements shows
a stable ram pressure balance between the winds occurs
throughout the orbit, so radiative braking should not be
very important. However, accounting for the reduced wind
velocities due to radiative inhibition and for orbital motion
shows that radiative braking might happen for a short phase
around periastron (Parkin et al. 2011; Madura et al. 2013).
Since the shock of the weaker-wind, secondary star produces
the X-ray emission in η Carinae, whether radiative braking
happens should have little eﬀect on the X-ray emission at
periastron since a wind that shocks very close to its surface
at a fraction of its terminal speed (with radiative braking)
and a wind that never initiates (no radiative braking) both
produce eﬀectively zero X-ray emission.

Madura et al. (2013) computed a grid of SPH simu-
˙MA = 8.5, 4.8, and
lations spanning three mass-loss rates
2.4 × 10−4 M(cid:12) yr−1 to primarily investigate how the pri-
mary mass-loss rate aﬀects the wind–wind interaction re-
gion. These were all done with the strong coupling between
the primary radiation ﬁeld and the secondary wind. To de-
termine the maximum extent of the coupling’s inﬂuence,

3 Note that this is diﬀerent than the inhibition of the wind de-
scribed by Soker & Behar (2006), where soft X-rays ionize from
the shock ionize the companion wind around periastron and thus
reduce the companion wind (an idea based on this phenomenon
occurring in X-ray binaries; Stevens & Kallman 1990). To avoid
further nomenclature discrepancies in the literature, we propose
to call this phenomenon ‘ionization inhibition’.

we repeat the set of simulations with the most probable
˙MA = 8.5× 10−4 M(cid:12) yr−1 with no coupling. Table 1 provides
the stellar, wind, and orbital parameters of the simulations
used in this work. The simulations of Madura et al. (2013)
also spanned a range of resolutions by varying the outer
boundary rmax = 1.5a, 10a and 100a while keeping the num-
ber of SPH particles in a simulation approximately constant.
We embed the timesteps of the various resolutions inside one
another to produce the highest possible accuracy of the hy-
drodynamic structure around η Carinae for computing the
model CCE spectra. This increases the number of particles
in the central r < 1.5a region to ∼100/1.5 = 67 times more
than the rmax = 100a simulation, which equates to a resolu-
tion improvement of a factor of 671/3 ∼ 4.

The new SPH simulations contain one notable improve-
ment over the simulations from Madura et al. (2013). To
account for the mixing of particles, the opacity value of an
individual particle was ¯κ = (ρiκi + ρ jκ j)/(ρi + ρ j) where ρi
and ρ j are the contribution to the density ρ that is due
to neighbouring particles ejected from stars i and j, respec-
tively. Particles with homogeneous neighbours behave as ex-
pected (for a region of only star i particles, ρi = ρ, ρ j = 0,
so ¯κ = κi), but particles near the contact discontinuity be-
tween the two wind species have a transition region, where
¯κ smoothly varies from κi to κ j starting on the wind-i side
and moving to the wind- j side. Even though the species
of particles remain separated on either side of the contact
discontinuity, the average opacity implementation was not
treating the particles as such. The real crux of this aver-
age opacity issue is that the size of the transition region
from κi to κ j is resolution dependent (more particles lead
to a smaller transition region), so diﬀerent-resolution simu-
lations show behaviour that varies beyond what is expected
from just diﬀering resolutions. The new method eliminates
the opacity averaging – all star i particles have κi, all star j
particles have κ j – so there is no transition region across a
contact discontinuity. If there are regions where the particles
are mixed, then the volume-averaged region of the mixing
still experiences an average opacity. The end result of this
improvement is that simulations of varying resolutions have

more consistent radiative driving, and therefore they show
more consistent hydrodynamic behaviour, e.g. the velocity
proﬁle of material accelerating from away from its star, and,
by extension, the location and temperature of shocks be-
tween the winds.

Additionally, but less consequentially, the new simula-
tions include the shadowing of the radiative inﬂuence on a
gas parcel by the farther star if it is obscured by the opaque
core of the nearer star. A particle that is in the umbra, and
hence does not have a line of sight to any portion of the
farther star, experiences zero radiative driving from the far-
ther star, while a particle in the penumbra, and hence only
has a line of sight to a fraction of the far star, experiences
a driving force proportional to the visible fractional area of
the farther star.

Finally, the new SPH simulations also shut oﬀ the ra-
diative acceleration for any particle with a temperature
T > 106 K as it is too ionized to be driven. This, too, has a
minimal eﬀect.

2.2 Results

Figs. 1–3 show the density (left column), temperature
(centre-left column), 1 keV X-ray source function (centre-
right column, described in the next section), and speed (right
column) of the embedded SPH simulations in the orbital
plane at periastron, zooming in with each successive ﬁgure.
The rows from top to bottom show model NC8.5, SC8.5,
SC4.8, and SC2.4, the meaning of which is in Table 2. The
major axis is the x-axis, the minor axis is the y-axis, and the
orbital angular momentum axis is the z-axis (pointing out
of the page). The stars, which orbit counter-clockwise are
oriented such that the primary (secondary) is on the right
(left) at periastron, though the majority of its ejected wind
is on the left (right) portion of the panels, shown in pink,
cyan, and blue (red and orange) in the density panels.

In the zoomed-out panels of Fig. 1, the eﬀects of the
stars speeding by each other at periastron show up as quasi-
circular disturbances (‘shells’ or ‘walls’) in the primary wind
on the left of the panels, as well as shells of primary wind
material emitted to the right that the secondary wind col-
lides into and gradually destroys. As expected, the distur-
bance in the primary wind and the intactness of the pri-
mary shell emitted one cycle prior depends on ˙MA: NC8.5
and SC8.5 show little primary wind disturbances and vis-
ible shells, while the disturbances are large and the shell
weak in SC2.4. For further details of this shell and the time
evolution of the simulations, see Madura et al. (2013).

The no-coupling simulations (top row) show the largest
deviations with the strong-coupling simulations in the speed

of the central regions (right-hand panels of Fig. 3). The
speed in SC8.5 reaches >4000 km s−1, while the maximum in
NC8.5 is slightly under v∞,B, and only obtained in the upper-
right portion of the panel. This is the eﬀect of primary radi-
ation accelerating the secondary wind emitted from the back
half of the secondary star (i.e. the half opposite the primary
star); the force vectors from both radiation sources co-add
to increase the acceleration of these particles, and this extra
acceleration becomes the most prominent near periastron
when the stars are closest. The increased acceleration leads
to the pre-shock speed of the leading arm being much higher,
so the post-shock temperature (centre-left column) and the
X-ray emissivity (centre-right column) are also much higher.

3 THERMAL X-RAY RADIATIVE TRANSFER

3.1 Method

We perform 3D radiative transfer calculations on the den-
sity and temperature structure of the embedded SPH sim-
ulations to determine the model thermal X-ray spectrum.
The SPH visualization program Splash (Price 2007) is the
basis for solving the formal solution to radiative transfer

(−zmax(x(cid:48),y(cid:48)) to zmax(x(cid:48),y(cid:48)); these values depend on {x’,y’}
since the volume is spherical). The observer is located along
the direction +z(cid:48).

The optical depth is

so τ(z(cid:48) = z(cid:48)
max) = 0. The intensity at the boundary of the sim-
ulation is I, and S is the source function. This formal solution
generates an X-ray map for each energy E that are summed
to produce the model spectra, and then folded through an
X-ray telescope response function to directly compare with
observations. The radiative transfer is performed at an en-
ergy resolution of 800 bins dex−1 from 0.3–12 keV (cover-
ing the full input range of the Chandra ACIS-S response
function). This energy resolution is more than needed for
most of the spectra, but is required to properly resolve the
Fe–K emission at ∼6.7 keV. Just as embedding the succes-
sively smaller outer boundary/higher resolution simulations
inside one another obtains the maximum spatial resolution
of the density and temperature structure, the {x(cid:48),y(cid:48)} grids of
the radiative transfer calculation are also embedded in each
other. The inner region is the square of {x(cid:48),y(cid:48)} < ±1.5a, the
middle region is a square with a hole of the inner-region size
at its centre ±1.5a < {x(cid:48),y(cid:48)} < ±10a, and the outer region is
the same shape ±10a < {x(cid:48),y(cid:48)} < ±100a. Each of these re-
gions have 400×400 pixels across them, so their resolutions
are 1.73, 11.6, and 116×1012cm for the inner, middle, and
outer regions, respectively. Fig. 4 shows a schematic of the
three calculation regions that sum together to generate the
ﬁnal model spectra.

Solar abundances (Asplund et al. 2009) are used through-
out this work; the enhancement of nitrogen at the expense
of carbon and oxygen in η Carinae’s primary spectra will
only have a minute eﬀect on the X-ray absorption.

The line of sight to the binary orbit of η Carinae has
been the source of much discussion in the literature. While
the consensus is that the binary orbit is inclined i ∼ 135◦ to
align the orbital axis with the Homunculus axis, there are
two widely discrepant azimuthal viewing angles. The ﬁrst
has the secondary star in front for the majority of the ec-
centric orbit (observer at the +x-axis, longitude of perias-
tron ω ∼ 270◦), while the other is the exact opposite (ob-
server at the −x-axis, ω ∼ 90◦). These place the observer on
the right or left side of the orbital-plane images in Figs. 1-

Figure 5. Axes and the orbits in the lab frame of the two lines of
sight explored in this work: ω = 252◦, i = 135◦ (left) and ω = 90◦,
i = 135◦ (right). Red: major (x) axis, green: minor (y) axis, blue:
orbital (z) axis, magenta: primary orbit, cyan: secondary orbit.
These lines of sight only rotate through ω and i, which results in
the projected orbital axis (blue) pointing up. To compare with
the images of η Carinae on the sky, rotate through a position
angle of PA = 40◦ clockwise to align the orbital axis with the
Homunculus axis, which is found to be the case by Madura et al.
(2012). Dashed axes are oriented into the page. The solid axes
on the left are out of the page, while the solid axis on the right
is parallel to the page. The secondary is in front at apastron for
ω = 252◦ (left) and behind at apastron for ω = 90◦ (right). Each
axes length, prior to projection, is 1a. The black arrows indicate
the directions of the orbits: clockwise (due to i > 90◦).

mildly susceptible to circumstellar absorption (i.e. absorp-
tion within the rmax = 100a simulation volume) due to the
low opacity at this energy (κ(10 keV) = 0.36 cm2 g−1), so
it is a good proxy for the location of the intrinsic emis-
sion, while the 1 keV ﬂux (left half) is highly inﬂuenced by
this absorption (κ(1 keV) = 5.9 cm2 g−1). Furthermore, the
ω = 90◦ line of sight (bottom half) suﬀers much more absorp-
tion than its counterpart since it views the system through
the denser primary wind, while ω = 252◦ (top half) looks
predominantly through secondary wind material. The cou-
pling choice also strongly inﬂuences the inner regions (right
column of each quadrant). The strong-coupling simulations
(bottom three rows of each quadrant) have signiﬁcant emis-
sion at this scale, while the no-coupling model (top row of
each quadrant) does not. In the large outer boundary im-
ages (left column of each quadrant), the emission from the
comoving shock of the secondary wind catching up with the
primary wind shell is visible; it is much lower per solid angle,
but it also occupies a larger volume and is therefore neces-
sary for the CCE spectral matching. We therefore state that
the large outer boundary of the simulations is a requirement
to match the CCE observations.

The next step is summing the pixel maps for all en-
ergies to generate model spectra for the two lines of sight.
Fig. 7 shows the inner, middle, outer, and sum model spec-
tra for NC8.5 at ω = 252◦ (top), SC8.5 at ω = 252◦ (centre),
and SC8.5 at ω = 90◦ (bottom). The light lines are before
accounting for the absorption of the Homunculus and the
interstellar medium (ISM), i.e. the ﬂuxes from the radiative
transfer calculations at the rmax = 100a simulation bound-
ary, while the dark lines include the extra absorption com-
ponent4, i.e. the ﬂuxes that get folded through the Chandra

Falceta-Gon¸calves & Abraham (2009), Abraham & Falceta-
Gon¸calves (2010), and Kashi et al. (2011). The most con-
straining work for determining the line of sight to η Cari-
nae is Madura et al. (2012) since, as opposed to the point-
source nature of the other diagnostics, they used spatially
resolved [Fe] emission to constrain all three viewing angles –
inclination, azimuth, and position angle (PA) – to i ∼ 135◦,
ω ∼ 252◦, and PA∼ 40◦, which aligns the orbital axis with
the Homunculus axis.

Since the X-ray optical depths should diﬀer noticeably
from one line of sight to the other, we perform the radia-
tive transfer with the observer at both viewing locations:
ω = 252◦ and ω = 90◦. Fig. 5 shows the projections of these
viewpoints on the sky without the PA rotation. Because the
point-like CCE X-rays are insensitive to the PA rotation,
and the vertical is a better reference line than 40◦ clockwise
of north, the X-ray images presented subsequently do not
include the PA rotation.

response function. As is shown in the images, the coupling
strength has a large inﬂuence on the emission from the inner
region. The ﬂatter shape in the hard region and the ratio of
the ∼ 6.7 keV to ∼ 6.9 keV Fe lines indicate the higher tem-
perature of the X-ray-producing gas in the strong-coupling
simulations. The outer region produces the largest contribu-
tion to the emission in NC8.5 (green above blue and purple),
again showing the need for such large scale hydrodynamic
simulations, but the outer region is the weakest component
in SC8.5 (green below blue and purple) since the strong cou-
pling produces much central emission. The reduced X-ray
emission below ∼4 keV in ω = 90◦ (bottom panel) compared
to ω = 252◦ (middle panel) is from the extra circumstellar
absorption looking through the higher density primary stel-
lar wind. The circumstellar absorption is even high enough
to be the dominant component for the inner region of ω = 90◦
since the pre-ISM/pre-Homunculus spectra (faint blue, bot-
tom panel) is already heavily absorbed.
Fig. 8 shows the summed spectra for all four models
and both lines of sight. Among the SC models for ω = 252◦
(top panel), the variations due to absorption, the dominant
source of which is the shell of primary wind material ejected
during the previous periastron cycle, are subtle but notice-
able due to the diﬀering mass of the primary-wind shell. On
the other hand, the SC models of ω = 90◦ (bottom panels)
show large variations due to looking through primary winds
of varying densities when compared with each other (green
to purple to blue) and when compared with their ω = 252◦
counterparts. The extra absorption of the NC model is also
apparent for ω = 90◦.

Figs. 9 & 10 show the same spectra as Figs. 7 & 8 now
folded through the Chandra ACIS-S response function. The
CCE observation (see below) is also plotted (black). All the
trends of the previous plots are shown, but the shape of the
detector response make the changes in the soft part of the
band due to absorption changes harder to see.

The CCE spectrum is created by taking the minimum
ﬂux of ﬁve (six) spectra at each energy band across the
2009.0 (2014.6) minimum. Rather than repeat this with the
model, which would involve doing the embedding of, and the
radiative transfer calculations on, the SPH output at those
11 phases, we simply choose the observation from 2009 Jan-
uary 22 (Hamaguchi et al. 2014) as representative of the
CCE spectrum. This observation, which occurs ∼0.003 in
phase (6 d) after X-ray phase 0.0 (according to the RXTE
light curve observations; Corcoran et al. 2010), is the closest
to the CCE spectra; the 2009 January 22 observation only
has slightly more soft ﬂux than the CCE model. We choose
to match this observation with exactly periastron (orbital
phase 0.0) of the SPH simulations. There can be a shift be-
tween X-ray phase 0.0 and periastron, but since the spectra
that are used to generate the CCE only vary slightly across
the ∼0.015 in phase of the deep minimum, modelling the
CCE can not strongly constrain this phase shift.

Fig. 11 summarizes the main result of this work. For
˙MA = 8.5× 10−4 M(cid:12) yr−1, the
the preferred mass-loss rate of
model spectra summed over the entire rmax = 100a simu-

and observing orientations, all absorption values for Figs. 7-
10 are nH = 3.7× 1022 cm−2, the optimal value for matching the
NC8.5/SC8.5, ω = 252◦ spectra to the observation.

comes from the radiative transfer calculation, so it only includes
circumstellar absorption.

lation volume reproduce the observed CCE spectrum; the
strong- and no-coupling spectra well bound the observation
for ω = 252◦(top panel), while they bound the hard portion
and converge on the soft portion for ω = 90◦ (bottom panel)
using a lower ISM/Homunculus absorption value. Therefore,
the CCE emission arises from the current secondary wind
colliding with primary wind ejected during the previous pe-
riastron passage, as well as emission on a smaller scale from
the downstream portion of the leading-arm of the wind–
wind collision region between the stars. Additionally, the
result suggests an intermediate amount of coupling between
the primary radiation and secondary wind in η Carinae.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Absorbing column and line of sight

Each line of sight can reproduce the observations at the same
level through employing slightly diﬀerent ISM/Homunculus
absorbing columns. The line of sight plays a signiﬁcant role
in the inner spectra since the impact parameters to the stars
are lower and thus the column densities are higher, but this

eﬀect is mitigated in the middle and outer regions as the im-
pact parameters are larger and column densities lower (see
Fig. 7). Therefore, the full model CCE spectra is only moder-
ately aﬀected by the line of sight, which can be counteracted
by diﬀerent nH values. By matching the spectral set (strong
coupling and no coupling) for each line of sight indepen-
dently, the optimal values are nH = {3.7,2.5}×1022 cm−2 for
ω = {252,90}◦. Therefore, the CCE X-ray emission is not
a good diagnostic for determining the line of sight to the
system.

It is also worth noting that both ISM/Homunculus
values are consistent with the literature value of nH =

This value accounts
for all absorption to the X-ray emitting source, while the
present work splits the absorption into a circumstellar com-
ponent (incorporated into the radiative transfer calcula-
tion within the rmax = 100a simulation boundary) and an
ISM/Homunculus component, so the model values being be-
low the literature value means they are in agreement.

4.2 Comparisons with thermal X-ray spectral

ﬁtting parameters

Common ﬁtting procedures for thermal X-ray data in-
volve constructing a model of 2-3 sources of emission that
have diﬀerent temperatures and possibly diﬀerent absorb-
ing columns. This is obviously a simpliﬁcation since an X-
ray source will typically have an assortment of material at a
range of temperatures and absorbing columns, but the sim-
pliﬁed two-temperature or three-temperature models have
been able to well reproduce X-ray data, including that of η
Carinae (e.g. Hamaguchi et al. 2014). We compute the tem-
perature distribution and absorbing columns of the gas in
the hydrodynamic simulations to compare with the simplis-
tic ﬁts.

Fig. 12 shows the mass–temperature distribution of
the secondary wind for all four models. (Recall that X-ray
emission scales ∼ρ2, so the X-ray deviations between mod-
els in orders of magnitude is twice that of this plot.) In
log-spaced bins, the peak for NC8.5 is ∼ 3 × 106 K, while
the SC models peak closer to ∼ 107 K. This latter value
is consistent with the one-temperature ﬁtting parameter of
1.05 keV → 1.22× 107 K that Hamaguchi et al. (2007) found
from ﬁtting the 2003.5 CCE observation, even though the
strong-coupling spectra from the hydrodynamic modelling
are harder than the observation. The updated ﬁtting of
Hamaguchi et al. (2014); Hamaguchi & Corcoran (2015) in-
dicates material at ∼5 keV → 5.8× 107 K, which is also seen
in the models, though in less quantity than the 1.05 keV
component. The ratio of the amount of material in NC8.5
to SC8.5 at log T (K) = 6, 7, and 8 is ∼2, ∼1, and ∼0.5,
respectively, which further explains why SC8.5 has a harder
spectrum. The ﬁgure also shows that the maximum temper-
ature of material produced in each of the simulations, which
decreases from SC8.5 to SC4.8 to SC2.4 to NC8.5, follows
the trend of the coupling strength5.

To compute nH, we use a method that pixel-by-pixel
compares the intrinsic intensity and the absorbed intensity
as a function of energy, and then uses the opacity of that
energy to determine the absorbing column. The intrinsic in-
tensity is
I∗(E,x(cid:48),y(cid:48)) =

(cid:90) zmax(x(cid:48),y(cid:48))

5 Within the set of strong-coupling computations, the secondary
˙MA increases to preserve the predicted
luminosity increases as
mass-loss rate scaling of CAK theory, so the opacity decreases
(see Appendix 1 of Madura et al. 2013), thus its product with
a consistent primary luminosity among the three strong-coupling
models also decreases, causing the coupling to slightly increase
with increasing ˙MA.

Note that nH is a function of energy since the emission loca-
tions of gas producing X-rays at diﬀerent energies can vary.
Fig. 13 shows the nH values for NC8.5 for 0.1, 1, and
10 keV (left to right) for ω = 252◦ (top rows) and ω = 90◦
(bottom rows) on scales of ±100a and ±20a. The absorb-
ing column is higher for ω = 90◦, and the absorbing column
in the centre increases with energy, indicating the highest
energy X-rays are closest to the stars. The upper portion
(red and yellow) of the ω = 252◦ plots are column densities
through secondary wind, with the clumps caused by the sec-
ondary wind pummelling the primary shell visible (black).
There is also a portion of the lower-left quadrant that is
viewed through primary wind (blue) as the secondary ap-
proaches periastron on the right side of centre (see Fig. 5),
so the primary wind ﬁlls in left of centre. This material is
the beginning of the next cycle’s primary wind shell.
Fig. 14 shows the 1 keV absorbing columns for all four
models. The ω = 90◦ images (bottom rows) show the de-
creasing absorbing column as ˙MA decreases, as well as the
larger deviations in the primary wind from periastron pas-
sage (see Fig. 1). For ω = 252◦, the projected area of X-
rays seen through the primary wind (blue in the left-hand
panels, blue to black to red in the right-hand panels) in-
creases with decreasing ˙MA since the opening angle of the
shock cone is wider. The absorption from the primary shell
in the upper portion of the plots also decreases with decreas-
ing ˙MA. Comparing the no-coupling model (left column) to
the strong-coupling models (right three columns) also shows
that the nH at the very centre of the image (best seen in the
second row) is much larger for the strong coupling, again in-
dicating X-rays are coming from near the centre, while the
no-coupling X-rays are coming from farther out (see also
Fig. 3, third row).

While the pixel maps are useful for seeing the range
of absorption values, the typical data ﬁtting results only
produce a single value of absorption per emission location.

Therefore, we convert these absorption images to a single
value by weighting it with the intrinsic intensity per pixel to
determine the single absorption value for that energy,

The top panel of Fig. 15 shows nH(E) for SC8.5 split into its
components for ω = 252◦ (solid) and ω = 90◦ (dashed). (Note
that since each component is a weighted average, the aver-
age of the inner, middle, and outer does not equate to the
value of the whole area.) The majority of lines increase with
increasing E, indicating that the higher energy X-rays are
produced closer in to the centre. The exception is the outer
emission from ω = 252◦, which the top row of Fig. 14 shows
is from fewer X-rays being produced along rays through the
primary wind as E increases. Consequently, more hard X-
rays pass through the lower density secondary wind in the
outer region, and thus have lower nH’s as E increases. The
bottom panel of Fig. 15 show the absorption variation at
1 keV for the four models. Since the strong-coupling mod-
els are dominated by the X-ray emission from the centre,
the whole and inner absorbing columns (blue and red) are
identical for both lines of sight. On the other hand, the no-
coupling whole values have meaningful contributions from

each region. The strong-coupling models for ω = 252◦ pro-
duce approximately the same nH since they are dominated
by the emission near the centre of the system, as shown by
the small cyan region in the centre of the right three panels
on the second row of Fig. 14. The absorptions for ω = 90◦
increase as ˙MA increases as expected.

5 CONCLUSIONS
We model the CCE X-ray spectra of η Carinae from 3D hy-
drodynamic models and radiative transfer calculations. Em-
bedding successively higher resolution simulations of rmax
= 100a, 10a, and 1.5a allows for the most detailed density
and temperature structure of η Carinae out to r = 100a to
date, and thus provides an excellent basis for calculating the
CCE spectra. The coupling of the primary radiation to the
secondary wind is important for determining how the sec-
ondary wind, ejected on the side of the secondary star away
from the primary, accelerates. The acceleration components
from both stellar radiation ﬁelds are additive in this region,
so a strong coupling produces wind speeds, post-shock tem-
peratures, and X-ray ﬂuxes greater than that expected for
a terminal-speed shock, and certainly greater than if there
is no coupling between the primary radiation ﬁeld and the
secondary wind. The primary mass-loss rate is also an im-
portant parameter; there is recent observational evidence
that it might have changed (Corcoran et al. 2010; Mehner
et al. 2010), and the wind-wind collision region is strongly
aﬀected by it (Madura et al. 2013).
The model CCE spectra for ˙MA = 8.5×10−4 M(cid:12) yr−1 re-
produce the properties of the observed CCE spectrum. For
ω = 252◦ the strong- and no-coupling spectra bound the ob-

Figure 15. Absorption column versus energy for NC8.5 (top
panel), and absorption column at 1 keV for all models (bottom).
Both panels contain ω = 252◦ (solid) and ω = 90◦ (dashed). The
x-axis in the bottom panel is linearly spaced in ˙MA for the strong-
coupling models, while the no-coupling model is oﬀset to the right
for clarity.

the observed spectra. Therefore, η Carinae has a moderate
coupling between the primary radiation and secondary wind,
and the CCE X-ray emission is generated from both the sec-
ondary wind colliding with primary wind ejected during the
previous periastron passage, and the smaller scale emission
downstream of the leading arm of the current wind-wind col-
lision shock. Additionally, the CCE is not a good diagnostic
for distinguishing between the two observer lines of sight.

We also compute the temperature distribution and the
absorbing column of X-rays for comparing with these param-
eters typically derived from ﬁtting X-ray data. As expected,
the model produces a much wider range of both parameters
than a several-temperature ﬁt to the data.
