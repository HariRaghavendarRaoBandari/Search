ABSTRACT

We investigate how observations of synchrotron intensity ﬂuctuations can be used to probe the sonic and
Alfvénic Mach numbers of interstellar turbulence, based on mock observations performed on simulations of
magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. We ﬁnd that the structure function slope, and a diagnostic of anisotropy that
we call the integrated quadrupole ratio modulus, both depend on the Alfvénic Mach number. However, these
statistics also depend on the orientation of the mean magnetic ﬁeld in the synchrotron emitting region relative
to our line of sight, and this creates a degeneracy that cannot be broken by observations of synchrotron intensity
alone. We conclude that the polarization of synchrotron emission could be analyzed to break this degeneracy,
and suggest that this will be possible with the Square Kilometre Array.

1. INTRODUCTION

Turbulence and magnetic ﬁelds are both ubiquitous in
the Milky Way (Ferrière 2001; Elmegreen & Scalo 2004;
Falceta-Gonçalves et al. 2014; Haverkorn et al. 2015), and
signiﬁcantly affect the formation of stars (McKee & Ostriker
2007; Dobbs et al. 2014), how gas is recycled in the
Galaxy, dynamo ampliﬁcation of the Galactic magnetic ﬁeld
(Beresnyak & Lazarian 2015; Brandenburg 2015), and cos-
mic ray propagation (Scalo & Elmegreen 2004). However,
the nature of turbulent ﬂows in the magnetized interstellar
medium (ISM) is largely unknown, as key properties of turbu-
lence are poorly constrained by observations. Thus, to better
understand these galactic processes, and galaxy evolution as
a whole, we require methods to quantitatively analyze turbu-
lence in the ISM.

Due to the random nature of turbulence, these methods must
examine statistics of observable quantities that depend upon
either the density, velocity or magnetic ﬁeld of the interstel-
lar medium to recover the properties of turbulence in the ob-
served ISM phase. These properties include the sonic and
Alfvénic Mach numbers,

Ms = (cid:28)|v|

cs (cid:29) ,

and MA = (cid:28)|v|

vA(cid:29) ,

(1)

respectively, where v is the velocity vector of a parcel of gas,
cs is the speed of sound, and vA = |B|√ρ is the Alfvén speed,
with B the magnetic ﬁeld in the parcel of gas, and ρ its den-
sity. These Mach numbers describe how fast the gas motions
are relative to the sound speed and Alfvén speed respectively.
For example, turbulence in the warm neutral medium of
the ISM can be studied by observing the 21 cm emission

from neutral hydrogen. Analysis of these velocity statistics of
neutral hydrogen in the Milky Way with the Velocity Chan-
nel Analysis and Velocity Correlation Spectrum techniques
(Lazarian & Pogosyan 2000, 2006, see Lazarian 2009 for a re-
view) has enabled the velocity spectrum of the warm neutral
medium to be studied (for example, Chepurnov et al. 2010).
Additionally, Burkhart et al. (2010) employed the third and
fourth order statistical moments of the neutral hydrogen col-
umn density of the Small Magellanic Cloud to show that ap-
proximately 90% of its neutral gas is sub- or transonic.

Another physical process that can be used to study in-
terstellar turbulence is linearly polarized synchrotron radia-
tion, emitted by ultra-relativistic electrons spiralling around
magnetic ﬁeld lines. Recently, Gaensler et al. (2011) and
Burkhart et al. (2012) have shown that the skewness and
kurtosis of polarization gradients of synchrotron emission
can constrain the sonic Mach number in the warm ionized
medium (WIM). This technique has been applied by these au-
thors and Iacobelli et al. (2014) to observations, all of which
demonstrate that the WIM is approximately transonic.

In this paper, we investigate how observed statistics of the
total intensity of synchrotron radiation can be used to study
turbulence in the ISM. To determine the intensity of the syn-
chrotron radiation, we assume that the ultra-relativistic elec-
trons have a homogeneous and isotropic power-law energy
distribution of the form

N (E) dE = KE2α−1 dE,

(2)
where N (E) is the number density of electrons with energy
between E and E + dE, K is a normalization constant and α
is the spectral index. The emitted synchrotron intensity I, at
frequency ν, is then given by (Ginzburg & Syrovatskii 1965):

the magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the line of sight, Γ denotes
the gamma function, and dL represents an inﬁnitesimal length
along the line of sight. The integral runs from the back of the
volume of synchrotron-emitting electrons to the observer at
L = 0.

Early studies on how to use statistics of synchrotron inten-
sity to study turbulent magnetic ﬁelds either assumed that γ =
2, or that the magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence was
isotropic (Chibisov & Ptuskin 1981; Lazarian & Shutenkov
1990; Lazarian & Chibisov 1991; Chepurnov 1998). How-
ever,
there is theoretical (Goldreich & Sridhar 1995, see
review by Brandenburg & Lazarian 2013) and numerical
(Shebalin et al. 1983; Cho & Lazarian 2002, see review by
Cho et al. 2003) evidence that MHD turbulence should be
anisotropic, with the plasma ﬂows elongated in the direction
of the local magnetic ﬁeld. This causes the synchrotron inten-
sity images to appear to have ﬁlaments, corresponding to the
stronger magnetic ﬁeld strength in the plasma ﬂows. There
are also theoretical reasons why γ should not be constant, but
vary throughout a galaxy. Immediately after electrons are ﬁrst
accelerated to ultra-relativistic speeds, which may occur by
diffusive shock acceleration in a supernova explosion, the cos-
mic ray electron population typically creates a radio spectrum
with index between −0.1 and −0.5, corresponding to 1.1 <
γ < 1.5 (Green 1988). As the ultra-relativistic electrons prop-
agate, they lose energy via their emitted synchrotron radia-
tion, inverse-Compton scattering, and bremsstrahlung. These
energy losses affect high energy electrons more than low en-
ergy electrons, causing the synchrotron spectrum to steepen,
resulting in more negative values of α, and larger values of
γ. An older, steep spectrum electron population has dif-
fused away from the injection point, and so occupies a greater
volume than the young, ﬂat spectrum electron population.
Hence, it is expected that we should ﬁnd ﬂat-spectrum syn-
chrotron emission near star-forming regions in the Galactic
plane, but steep-spectrum emission further from the plane.
This is supported by observations; for example, Bennett et al.
(2003) found that γ varies with Galactic latitude, being small-
est in star-forming regions (1.5) and larger in the halo (2.1),
and Tabatabaei et al. (2008) and Basu et al. (2015) found that
in nearby spiral galaxies, the diffuse synchrotron emission has
a ﬂatter spectrum in the spiral arms than in the inter-arm re-
gions. Although values of γ between 1.5 and 2.5 are more
typical of synchrotron radiation in the Milky Way, in this pa-
per we will analyze values of γ between 1 and 4, to cover all
values likely to be observed.

Recently, Lazarian & Pogosyan (2012), hereafter LP12,
studied how the statistics of synchrotron emission are related
to the underlying turbulent magnetic ﬁeld analytically, with-
out assuming that γ = 2, or isotropic MHD turbulence. They
predicted that the normalized correlation function (NCF) of
synchrotron intensity is insensitive to γ, and hence is an ideal
statistic to be applied to observations, because it provides
a more robust link between the statistics of synchrotron in-
tensity and the statistics of the magnetic ﬁeld. LP12 also
introduced a new statistic for quantitatively describing the
observed degree of anisotropy in MHD turbulence, that we
will call the quadrupole ratio, and suggested that this statistic
could constrain the compressibility of a plasma, as well as the
orientation of the mean magnetic ﬁeld relative to the line of
sight.

In this paper, we calculate the NCFs of mock synchrotron
intensity maps generated from simulations of ideal MHD tur-
bulence, to test the prediction that this statistic is insensi-

tive to γ. Additionally, we investigate how the NCF and the
quadrupole ratio are related to the properties of the underly-
ing magnetized turbulence, in the hope of constructing a tech-
nique that allows us to characterize magnetized turbulence in
the ISM from observations of diffuse synchrotron emission.
Such a technique may involve plotting each simulated syn-
chrotron statistic against the sonic or Alfvénic Mach number,
for instance, and using the corresponding range of Mach num-
bers compatible with an observed statistic to constrain each
parameter of the turbulence in the data. Our ability to estimate
parameters of turbulence is then determined by the observa-
tional uncertainty in the measured statistic, the uncertainty in
the simulated statistics due to random ﬂuctuations in the tur-
bulence, and our ability to resolve any degeneracy between
parameters of turbulence.

suggesting different
turbulent regimes. Stepanov et al. (2014) showed that cosmic
rays are not in local energy equipartition with magnetic
ﬁelds, and from this, that the distribution of cosmic rays in
the Milky Way is uniform on scales of at least 100 pc.

In Section 2 we introduce the analytic theory of synchrotron
ﬂuctuations developed by LP12, and the results pertinent to
this paper. In Section 3 we introduce the simulations of ideal
MHD turbulence that we use, the method that we use to con-
struct mock synchrotron intensity maps, and the properties of
turbulence we examine. In Section 4 we test the predictions of
LP12, and investigate how the statistics of synchrotron ﬂuc-
tuations depend on the properties of the turbulence and the
orientation of the mean magnetic ﬁeld relative to the line of
sight. We discuss the possibility of determining properties of
turbulence from observations of diffuse synchrotron emission
in Section 5, and conclude in Section 6.

2. THEORY OF SYNCHROTRON FLUCTUATIONS

For a ﬁxed observing frequency, Eq. 3 demonstrates that
ﬂuctuations in synchrotron intensity are caused by ﬂuctua-
tions in the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to
the line of sight, γ, K, and path length variations. In gen-
eral, the ﬁrst three of these variables will vary over the sky
and along the line of sight. B⊥ will vary due to turbulent
ﬂuctuations in the Galactic magnetic ﬁeld and the relative ori-
entation between the line of sight and the magnetic ﬁeld. γ
and K will vary due to the cosmic rays having different ages
or input particle spectra. In this paper, we will be considering
the synchrotron intensity observed over small ﬁelds of view,
where we assume that all lines of sight through the emitting
region have the same length, and that γ and K are constant
throughout the emitting region. These latter assumptions are
valid because γ varies on larger scales in the Milky Way than
the scales we consider, and Stepanov et al. (2014) showed that
the distribution of cosmic rays, and hence K, is uniform on
scales of at least 100 pc. The consequence of these assump-
tions is that within any small ﬁeld of view, the ﬂuctuations
in synchrotron intensity are only caused by ﬂuctuations in the
magnetic ﬁeld.

However, as γ and K can differ between ﬁelds of view, we
require statistics to be independent of γ and K, so that varia-
tions in the statistics of synchrotron intensity calculated across

the sky are only caused by changes in the alignment and
amplitude distribution of the projected magnetic ﬁeld. Such
statistics of synchrotron intensity are sensitive only to the pa-
rameters of magnetized turbulence, such as the sonic Mach
number, and hence provide the simplest means by which to
quantitatively determine the values of these parameters. As
K is assumed to be constant within any given ﬁeld of view,
it only serves to scale the observed synchrotron intensity by
some factor, and hence should not inﬂuence any of the statis-
tics calculated in this paper. Thus, we will only examine the
γ dependence of statistics henceforth.

One potentially useful statistic is the NCF of synchrotron

emissivity:

(r) = hBγ

(x + r)i − hBγ

where x = (x, y, z) is a position vector to a point in the
emitting region, described by a Cartesian coordinate system
in which the z-axis is along the line of sight. r is the sepa-
ration vector between two points being used to calculate the
correlation function, and h...i denotes an average over all x.
Under the assumption of an isotropic Gaussian ﬁeld, LP12
found that ξBγ
only has a weak dependence on γ. Further-
more, by applying these equations to an analytic model of
turbulence involving a mean magnetic ﬁeld along the x axis,
with ﬂuctuations only along the y axis, LP12 found that the
NCF of synchrotron emissivity weakly depends on γ in this
anisotropic case, and becomes more sensitive to γ as the mean
magnetic ﬁeld strength decreases.

We can also deﬁne the normalized correlation coefﬁcients
for the components of the magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the
line of sight, i.e. Bx and By, by

c1(r) = hBx(x)Bx(x + r)i − hBx(x)i2
c2(r) = hBy(x)By(x + r)i − hBy(x)i2

hBx(x)2i − hBx(x)i2

(5)

(6)

,

hBy(x)2i − hBy(x)i2

respectively. Based on their ﬁnding that the NCF of syn-
chrotron emissivity is insensitive to γ, LP12 predicted that
for an isotropic Gaussian magnetic ﬁeld, and any γ values
between 1 and 4, ξBγ
can be approximated by the NCF for
γ = 2, namely

for a vector X = (x, y) describing the location of a point on
the plane of the sky, and for a separation vector in the plane
of the sky R, is also insensitive to γ, and show that this is
true for an isotropic random ﬁeld. LP12 also explain that the
structure function of synchrotron intensity, given by

The corresponding equation for anisotropic turbulence is
given by Eq. 28 in LP12, but for simplicity we will only test
the equation for the case of isotropic turbulence in this paper.
Following these results, LP12 conjecture that the NCF of the
observed synchrotron intensity, given by

˜M2(R)
˜M0(R)

DI (R) = h(I(X) − I(X + R))2i,

is the preferred statistic to use when analyzing synchrotron
ﬂuctuations, because it is linear on small scales, unlike the
correlation function. It is possible to calculate a normalized
structure function for synchrotron intensity from the NCF, by
using the formula

˜DI = 2(1 − ξI ).

(10)
As the NCF is expected to only weakly depend on γ, it is
hence expected that the normalized structure function should
also weakly depend on γ.

Conventionally, the power spectrum of an image of the col-
umn density of a turbulent volume of gas is said to be pro-
portional to k−(3+m), where k is the wavenumber, and m is
a constant that helps to identify the type of turbulence. For
example, m = 2/3 corresponds to Kolmogorov turbulence.
Under this convention, the corresponding structure function
is proportional to R1+m. We will be using m to characterize
the slope of the structure function throughout this paper.

Synchrotron intensity images can also be characterized by
how anisotropic they are, where the anisotropy could be intro-
duced by the interstellar magnetic ﬁeld constraining ionized
gas into ﬁlaments. To measure this anisotropy, LP12 sug-
gested using the multipole moments of the normalized struc-
ture function, given by

˜Mn(R) =

1

2π Z 2π

0

e−inφ ˜DI (R, φ) dφ.

(11)

In Eq. 11, n determines the order of the multipole to calcu-
late, R represents the radial distance between the points be-
ing used to calculate the structure function, and φ is the polar
angle subtended by the horizontal and a line connecting the
points, both measured in the plane of the sky. The n = 0
term gives the monopole, which measures the isotropic part of
the normalized structure function, and the n = 1 term gives
the dipole, which is identically zero because of the rotational
symmetry of the structure function. Thus, the lowest order,
non-zero multipole describing the anisotropy of the normal-
ized structure function is the n = 2 term, which gives the
quadrupole moment.

To produce a more robust statistic of anisotropy, LP12 sug-
gested normalizing the quadrupole moment by dividing by the
monopole moment. By using the rotational symmetry of the
normalized structure function, this statistic can be written as

−

2iR π
0 sin(2φ) ˜DI (R, φ) dφ
R 2π

˜DI (R, φ) dφ

.

(12)

The real part of ˜M2(R)/ ˜M0(R) is sensitive to anisotropy
along the vertical and horizontal axes of the image, and the
imaginary part is sensitive to anisotropy along the diagonals
of the image. Thus, the modulus of ˜M2(R)/ ˜M0(R) provides
a full characterization of the amplitude of any anisotropy (i.e.
the ﬁlamentarity of the synchrotron intensity), and the argu-
ment describes the orientation of the axis of anisotropy, i.e.
in what direction ﬁlaments of synchrotron intensity are elon-

gated. Both of these quantities provide useful diagnostics
of the observed turbulence. However, as the argument of
˜M2(R)/ ˜M0(R) mainly describes the direction of the mean
magnetic ﬁeld projected onto the plane of the sky, which can
alternatively be determined by using the polarization angle of
synchrotron emission observed at high frequencies, we will
focus on the modulus for the remainder of this paper. We
will henceforth refer to the modulus of ˜M2(R)/ ˜M0(R) as
the quadrupole ratio modulus, and to the real and imaginary
parts of ˜M2(R)/ ˜M0(R) as the real and imaginary parts of the
quadrupole ratio.

LP12 estimated that the quadrupole ratio modulus should
be approximately 0.4 for sub-Alfvénic turbulence (Alfvénic
Mach number less than 1, gas dynamics dominated by
the magnetic ﬁeld), and 0.3 for trans-Alfvénic turbulence
(Alfvénic Mach number approximately 1). For turbulence
in the super-Alfvénic regime (Alfvénic Mach number greater
than 1), the quadrupole ratio modulus was estimated to be
approximately 0.1. These estimates are inﬂuenced by the as-
sumed model of magnetized turbulence.

In Section 4.1.1 we will test the prediction that the NCF of
synchrotron emissivity is insensitive to γ, by calculating this
quantity for simulations of MHD turbulence. We will also
test whether the NCF can be approximated by the NCF for
γ = 2, and the conjecture that the NCF of synchrotron inten-
sity is also insensitive to γ. In Section 4.1.2, we test whether
the quadrupole ratio modulus is related to the Alfvénic Mach
number as predicted by LP12.

3. METHODOLOGY

To test the predictions of the synchrotron ﬂuctuation theory
developed by LP12, as well as the suitability of the structure
function and quadrupole ratio modulus as tracers of properties
of turbulence, we will apply the theory to numerical simula-
tions of MHD turbulence. In this section we will discuss how
our simulations of MHD turbulence were performed, and how
mock synchrotron intensity maps were produced for the sim-
ulations.

We use the second-order-accurate hybrid essentially non-
oscillatory code written by Cho & Lazarian (2003) to nu-
merically solve the ideal MHD equations in a periodic box,
namely:

∂ρ
∂t

+ ∇ · (ρv) = 0,

ρ(cid:20) ∂v

∂t

+ (v · ∇)v(cid:21) + ∇p −

4π

J × B = f ,

∂B
∂t − ∇ × (v × B) = 0,

(13)

(14)

(15)

∇ · B = 0.

(16)
In Equations 13 to 16, p is the thermal gas pressure, J =
∇× B is the current density, t is time, and f is a driving force.
Each of these quantities are normalized, so that Equations 13
to 16 become dimensionless, and the simulations are scale-
free. The quantities are hence measured in simulation units.

In our simulations we drive turbulence by setting f to be a
random solenoidal driving force that acts on large scales. We
also use an isothermal equation of state, p = c2
sρ, so that we
simulate compressible turbulence. Each simulation run starts
with fully ionized gas of uniform pressure and unit density

in a cube that has 512 pixels along each side, and a uniform
magnetic ﬁeld along the x-axis. We consider lines of sight
that are perpendicular to the mean ﬁeld, oriented along the y-
or z-axes, as shown in Figure 1.

The free variables in each simulation run are the initial pres-
sure, which controls the sonic Mach number, and the initial
magnetic ﬁeld strength, which controls the Alfvénic Mach
number. These two variables were adjusted to run 18 sim-
ulations, as listed in Table 1, which cover different regimes
of turbulence. Each simulation is assigned a code of the
form Ms0.45Ma1.72, for example, which means that the sonic
Mach number is 0.45, and the Alfvénic Mach number is 1.72.
Of these simulations, we expect that the Ms0.87Ma0.7 and
Ms0.48Ma0.65 simulations are most similar to the WIM of
the Milky Way, because they are sub- or transonic, and the
strength of the random component of the magnetic ﬁeld in
these simulations is comparable to the strength of the uni-
form ﬁeld, as found in the Milky Way (Gaensler et al. 2011,
Iacobelli et al. 2014, Sun et al. 2008).

Each simulation was allowed to evolve for ﬁve eddy
turnover times so that the turbulent energy cascade formed
over the inertial range, meaning that the turbulence had suf-
ﬁciently developed. The three-dimensional cubes of thermal
electron density, and the x, y and z components of the ve-
locity and magnetic ﬁeld, were then recorded for the speciﬁc
instance of turbulence captured in this snapshot.

From this output, the instantaneous sonic and Alfvénic
Mach numbers of each simulation are calculated according
to Eq. 1. The sound speed is calculated from the isothermal

equation of state, cs = pp/ρ, applied to the initial conditions

of the simulation, as the sound speed should be independent
of time for isothermal turbulence. These Mach numbers grad-
ually change over time, due to the random driving of the tur-
bulence. However, we are only interested in the Mach num-
bers of the turbulence for the speciﬁc instance observed, as
our goal is to compare statistics of the observed turbulence to

our method of determining the properties of turbulence relies
on the assumption that the statistics of synchrotron intensity
instantly adjust as the Mach numbers change. As can be seen
from Table 1, low values of the initial pressure produce su-
personic simulations, and high initial pressures produced sub-
sonic simulations. If the initial magnetic ﬁeld strength is low,
then the simulation is super-Alfvénic, and otherwise it is sub-
Alfvénic.

To construct maps of synchrotron emission for each simula-
tion, a three-dimensional cube of B⊥ was calculated accord-
ing to B⊥ = qB2
y for lines of sight along the z-axis,
and B⊥ = pB2
z for lines of sight along the y-axis. We
then assumed a ﬁxed observing frequency, and constant γ and
K within the emitting region, so that the synchrotron intensity

and integrated Bγ
along the line of sight. The resulting map
⊥
was then normalized by dividing the intensity at each pixel
by the number of pixels along the line of sight, so that the
produced intensity maps do not depend on the size of the sim-
ulation. An example synchrotron map is shown in Figure 1,
for the Ms0.48Ma0.65 simulation. This map shows large and
small scale ﬁlaments aligned with the magnetic ﬁeld.

In Section 4.3, we study how statistics of synchrotron in-
tensity depend on the angle between the mean magnetic ﬁeld
and the line of sight. To perform this study, we constructed
synchrotron maps for different lines of sight through the sim-
ulation cubes. For a line of sight initially along the z-axis, we
rotated the cube about the y-axis, and projected the x and z
components of the magnetic ﬁeld onto a vector perpendicu-
lar to both the y-axis and the new line of sight. B⊥ was then
calculated by B⊥ = q[Bx cos(θ) + Bz sin(θ)]2 + B2
y, for a
rotation around the y-axis by angle θ. For a line of sight ini-
tially along the y-axis, the same method was used, but with

the roles of the y- and z- axes interchanged.

From the cube thus formed, a sub-cube with 362 pixels
along each side was extracted from the centre of the cube,
as this is the largest sub-cube that exists for all lines of sight
into the cube. The synchrotron map was then produced as be-
fore, by integrating Bγ
along the line of sight and dividing by
⊥
the number of pixels along the line of sight.

4. RESULTS

4.1. Testing Lazarian and Pogosyan 2012

In this section we will test the predictions made by LP12,
using the three-dimensional MHD simulations listed in Ta-
ble 1.
In particular, we will focus on the predictions that
NCFs of synchrotron emissivity and intensity are insensitive
to γ, and that the quadrupole ratio provides a good measure
of anisotropy.

4.1.1. Correlation Function and Structure Function

⊥

One of the predictions made by LP12 is that the NCF of
synchrotron emissivity, ξBγ
can be approximated by Eq. 7
for isotropic Gaussian turbulence, and any value of γ between
1 and 4. We ﬁrst test if this equation is valid for the MHD
simulations being considered, by calculating the left and right
hand sides of Eq. 7. Due to the anisotropy introduced into
our simulations by the magnetic ﬁeld, and the fact that super-
sonic turbulence is non-Gaussian, we expect that Eq. 7 should
only be approximately true for subsonic, super-Alfvénic sim-
ulations. For other regimes of turbulence, we do not expect
there to be a good match between the left and right hand sides
of Eq. 7. The left hand side, ξBγ
is calculated according to
Eq. 4, and the right hand side is calculated using equations
5 and 6. Both the left and right hand sides are then radially
averaged, so that they can be plotted as a function of radial
separation r = |r|. We assume that γ = 2 for these calcula-
tions, so that there should be equality in Eq. 7 for isotropic
Gaussian turbulence.

These calculations were performed for all of the simula-
tions in Table 1. In Figure 2, we show representative plots of

the left and right hand sides of Eq. 7 for low magnetic ﬁeld
simulations (top row), and high magnetic ﬁeld simulations
(bottom row). Supersonic simulations are in the left column,
and subsonic simulations on the right. We ﬁnd that for all
simulations, there is a discrepancy between the left and right
hand sides of Eq. 7, that is largest on radial scales between
10 and 100 pixels. This discrepancy tends to increase as the
sonic Mach number of the simulation increases. Additionally,
by studying the corresponding plots for the Ms8.42Ma0.22
and Ms8.39Ma0.14 simulations, we ﬁnd that this discrepancy
tends to slightly increase as the strength of the mean magnetic
ﬁeld increases.

Thus, we ﬁnd as expected that Eq. 7 is not applicable to
simulations of ideal MHD turbulence. This is because the
derivation of Eq. 7 relies on the assumption that the syn-
chrotron emissivity has an isotropic Gaussian distribution.
For supersonic simulations, this assumption is violated be-
cause the formation of shocks compresses and ampliﬁes the
magnetic ﬁeld, causing the synchrotron emissivity to deviate
from a Gaussian distribution. For sub-Alfvénic simulations,
the strong magnetic ﬁelds produce anisotropic structures in
the synchrotron emissivity. Simulations that are subsonic and
super-Alfvénic also exhibit synchrotron emissivity distribu-
tions that deviate from a Gaussian, due to the natural evolu-
tion of the turbulence, and this produces a small discrepancy
between the left and right hand sides of Eq. 7.

Although the NCF of synchrotron emissivity cannot be cal-
culated via Eq. 7 for our simulations, it is still possible that
the NCF is insensitive to γ for γ values between 1 and 4, as
predicted by LP12. To test this prediction, we again calcu-
lated the NCF of synchrotron emissivity according to Eq. 4,
this time for values of γ between 1 and 4, in increments of
0.5.

In Figure 3 we display the NCFs of synchrotron emissivity
for γ values of 1, 2, 3 and 4, for four simulations. Simulations
with a weak magnetic ﬁeld are in the top row, and simulations
with a strong magnetic ﬁeld are in the bottom row. The left
column displays the NCFs for supersonic simulations, and the
right column for subsonic simulations. As shown in Figure
3a), we ﬁnd that the NCF of synchrotron emissivity exhibits
signiﬁcant γ dependence for simulations that are supersonic
and have a weak magnetic ﬁeld. By examining the NCFs for
the eight simulations with an initial magnetic ﬁeld strength of
0.1, we also ﬁnd that the degree of γ dependence decreases
as the sonic Mach number decreases. In particular, there is
signiﬁcantly reduced γ dependence for subsonic simulations,
as seen in Figure 3b).

For simulations with an initial magnetic ﬁeld strength of 1,
we ﬁnd that the degree of γ dependence is always less than for
the corresponding simulation with the same initial pressure,
but initial magnetic ﬁeld strength of 0.1. This is most clearly
seen in Figure 3c). As for the low magnetic ﬁeld simulations,
we ﬁnd that there is less γ dependence as the sonic Mach num-
ber decreases. In addition, we ﬁnd that there is no visible γ
dependence for the Ms8.42Ma0.22 and Ms8.39Ma0.14 simu-
lations.

Thus, we ﬁnd that for simulations with a signiﬁcantly
strong magnetic ﬁeld, or high pressure, the assumption that
the NCF of synchrotron emissivity is independent of γ is
valid. However, for supersonic simulations involving a weak
magnetic ﬁeld, the NCF of synchrotron emissivity is sensi-
tive to γ. This result differs from the theoretical ﬁndings of
LP12 because the formation of shocks causes the distribution
of synchrotron emissivity to become non-Gaussian, violating

the assumption of an isotropic Gaussian distribution.

LP12 also propose that the NCFs of synchrotron intensity
are insensitive to γ. As the synchrotron intensity is an observ-
able quantity, this is the prediction most relevant to this paper,
out of the ﬁve made by LP12. To test this prediction, we in-
tegrated Bγ
(i.e. the synchrotron emissivity, see equation 17)
⊥
along the line of sight for all simulations, for γ values between
1 and 4, in increments of 0.5. We only analysed synchrotron
maps produced for a line of sight along the z-axis, to enable a
direct comparison to the predictions made by LP12.

In Figure 4 we display the NCFs of synchrotron intensity
for the same simulations as in Figure 3, for γ values of 1, 2, 3
and 4. Similar to the results found for synchrotron emissiv-
ity, we ﬁnd that for simulations with an initial magnetic ﬁeld
strength of 0.1, the degree of γ dependence decreases as the
sonic Mach number decreases. We believe that this γ depen-
dence arises for the same reasons as discussed for the NCFs
of synchrotron emissivity, namely that the shocks generated
in supersonic turbulence create a non-Gaussian distribution
of synchrotron intensity. We also ﬁnd that the Ms8.42Ma0.22
and Ms8.39Ma0.14 simulations have very little dependence
on γ, as was found for synchrotron emissivity. However, un-
like the results found for the NCF of synchrotron emissiv-
ity, the NCFs of synchrotron intensity for simulations with
an initial magnetic ﬁeld strength of 1 do not display any
clear γ dependence in general, except for the Ms0.87Ma0.7
and Ms0.48Ma0.65 simulations. These simulations are tran-
sonic and subsonic respectively, and so we conclude that
the strong magnetic ﬁelds of these simulations are causing
anisotropic structures to survive the turbulent motion of the
plasma. These structures are likely the cause of the weak γ de-
pendence observed for the NCFs of the synchrotron intensity
maps of the Ms0.87Ma0.7 and Ms0.48Ma0.65 simulations.
We postulate that the reason why the NCFs for synchrotron
intensity of these simulations show some mild γ dependence,
but NCFs of synchrotron emissivity do not, is that integrat-
ing the synchrotron emissivity along the line of sight makes
the anisotropy easier to detect with the correlation function,
by superimposing cross-sections of synchrotron emitting ﬁla-
ments, where each cross-section is anisotropic.

Thus, we ﬁnd that the NCF of synchrotron intensity is in-
sensitive to γ for most regimes of turbulence. If the turbulence
is supersonic and has a weak mean magnetic ﬁeld, then the
NCF of synchrotron intensity does have some dependence on
γ. However, if we only consider values of γ that are likely to
be observed, between 1.5 and 2.5, say, then the NCF of syn-
chrotron intensity does not exhibit signiﬁcant dependence on
γ for any regime of turbulence. Hence, we can compare sim-
ulated and observed NCFs of synchrotron intensity without
needing to take γ into account, in most situations.

4.1.2. Quadrupole Ratio

To quantify the degree of anisotropy present in a map of
synchrotron intensity, LP12 introduced the quadrupole ra-
tio. Additionally, LP12 estimated that the quadrupole ra-
tio modulus should be less than 0.45, approximately 0.4 for
sub-Alfvénic turbulence, 0.3 for trans-Alfvénic turbulence,
and 0.1 for super-Alfvénic turbulence.
In this section we
will test these predictions with the simulations of ideal MHD
turbulence listed in Table 1, and assess the viability of the
quadrupole ratio as a descriptor of anisotropy.

We calculate the quadrupole ratio according to Eq. 12,
by ﬁrst calculating the normalized structure function of syn-
chrotron intensity using Eq. 10. These calculations are per-

formed for γ values between 1 and 4, in increments of 0.5.

In Figure 5 we show the quadrupole ratio moduli calcu-
lated for the same simulations as in Figure 3, for the same
values of γ. We ﬁnd that all quadrupole ratios depend on the
radial separation of the points used to calculate the structure
function, unlike the results found by LP12. In particular, the
quadrupole ratio modulus tends to decrease on larger radial
scales, indicating that there is less anisotropy on these scales.
This could be caused by how the MHD simulations are per-
formed; the energy injection scale for the simulations is ap-
proximately 200 pixels (this can differ between simulations),
and there is no anisotropy on this scale, because the turbu-
lence has not fully developed. The anisotropy takes time to
form down the cascade, which might be why the degree of
anisotropy generally decreases with increasing radial separa-
tion.

Many of the plots of the quadrupole ratio modulus also dis-
play a prominent peak or trough at a radial separation of ap-
proximately 4 pixels. These features arise because the two-
dimensional structure function exists on a discrete grid of
pixels, and the quadrupole ratio is calculated from this by
integrating over pixels that fall within a thin annulus. The
pixels of the structure function being used to calculate the
quadrupole ratio for a radial separation of 4 pixels all lie close
to the diagonals of the structure function, as no other pixels
fall into this radial bin. The imaginary part of the quadrupole
ratio is particularly sensitive to pixels along the diagonals, due
to its sin(2φ) dependence (Eq. 12). Hence, the real part of the
quadrupole ratio (which should be the larger component based
on the set-up of our simulation) is not well probed at this ra-
dial separation, and the measured quadrupole ratio is overly
sensitive to the small imaginary part, which traces diagonal
anisotropy. This anisotropy only exists because of random
ﬂuctuations in the turbulence, arbitrarily leading to peaks or
troughs in the quadrupole ratio modulus.

As illustrated in Figure 5, we ﬁnd that for a ﬁxed initial
pressure, simulations with a higher magnetic ﬁeld strength
(lower Alfvénic Mach number) have a larger quadrupole ratio
modulus. This is because stronger magnetic ﬁelds produce
more anisotropic structures, indicating that the quadrupole
ratio is a reliable measure of anisotropy. We also ﬁnd
that for a ﬁxed initial magnetic ﬁeld strength, simulations
with a lower sonic Mach number (higher pressure) have a
larger quadrupole ratio modulus, and hence exhibit higher
anisotropy. This is because the plasma generally has lower
velocity in these simulations, shocks do not form, and so the
magnetic ﬁeld is more capable of constraining the ﬂow of
plasma to produce anisotropic structures.

The quadrupole ratios calculated for the majority of the
simulations also exhibit some slight γ dependence, however
there does not seem to be any clear relationship between the
sonic and Alfvénic Mach numbers of the turbulence and how
γ affects the quadrupole ratio. How γ affects the measured
quadrupole ratio may depend upon the particular instance of
turbulence observed, and so γ must be measured in order to
compare observations to simulations. The two simulations
that do not show any γ dependence are the Ms8.42Ma0.22
and Ms8.39Ma0.14 simulations, as was found for the NCF of
synchrotron intensity.

Out of all the simulations studied, the Ms8.39Ma0.14 sim-
ulation has the greatest quadrupole ratio modulus (not shown
here), which has an amplitude of approximately 0.37 up to a
radial separation of approximately 100 pixels. Thus, we sup-
port the prediction that the quadrupole ratio modulus should

be less than 0.45 for all simulations, and the prediction that
sub-Alfvénic simulations have quadrupole ratio moduli that
are approximately 0.4. Our only supersonic, trans-Alfvénic
simulation is the Ms10.96Ma1.41 simulation, and this simu-
lation has a quadrupole ratio modulus of 0.15 or less. This
is much smaller than the value estimated by LP12 of 0.3,
however this difference is likely due to the Ms10.96Ma1.41
simulation being highly supersonic, with a weak initial mag-
netic ﬁeld. The simulations that are closest to being subsonic
and trans-Alfvénic, Ms0.87Ma0.7 and Ms0.48Ma0.65, have
quadrupole ratio moduli that are between 0.2 and 0.35 for
a wide range of radial separations. Hence, we also support
the prediction that simulations of trans-Alfvénic turbulence
should have quadrupole ratio moduli of approximately 0.3.
Finally, our super-Alfvénic simulations all exhibit quadrupole
ratio moduli between 0 and 0.15, and thus our ﬁndings sup-
port the prediction that the quadrupole ratio modulus for sim-
ulations of super-Alfvénic turbulence is approximately 0.1.

4.2. Statistical Diagnostics of Parameters of Turbulence
In this section we will compare statistics of the mock syn-
chrotron intensity maps to the sonic and Alfvénic Mach num-
bers of the corresponding simulations, to investigate whether
these properties of turbulence can be derived from syn-
chrotron intensity maps. The statistics we examine include
the structure function slope (via the variable m, the struc-
ture function slope minus 1), and the integrated quadrupole
ratio modulus of synchrotron intensity. However, as shown
in Section 4.1, the NCF of synchrotron intensity has a weak
dependence on γ, and thus it is possible that the statistics we
study in this section also depend on γ, as they are both re-
lated to the NCF. In Appendix A we show that m and the
integrated quadrupole ratio modulus depend only weakly on
γ, provided the regime of turbulence is not supersonic and
super-Alfvénic, and thus the value of γ in an observed region
of sky should not interfere with any procedure designed to
determine the sonic and Alfvénic Mach numbers from these
statistics in general. Henceforth, we consider the mock syn-
chrotron maps produced for γ = 2, as this value is typical
of the Milky Way and often assumed in analytical work, and
compare the statistics of these maps to the sonic and Alfvénic
Mach numbers. We also examine the skewness and kurtosis
of synchrotron intensity in Appendix B, and ﬁnd that they are
not sensitive to the sonic or Alfvénic Mach numbers.

For each simulation, each statistic is calculated for the syn-
chrotron maps produced for lines of sight along the y- and
z-axes, and the average of these is plotted in the following
ﬁgures. To provide uncertainties on each of these statistics,
we divided the synchrotron maps obtained for lines of sight
along the y- and z-axes into quarters, and calculated the statis-
tics for each of the eight quarters obtained. The standard error
of the mean of the statistics calculated for the quarters was
then used to deﬁne error bars on the following ﬁgures. To test
the reliability of these statistics, in Appendix C we examine
how sensitive the statistics are to changes in the size of the
simulation cube used to produce synchrotron intensity maps.
We ﬁnd that for the integrated quadrupole ratio modulus, all
but two simulations appear to be converging to a ﬁnal value,
and so we believe that these statistics are reliable. However,
there are signiﬁcant changes in the structure function slope
for small changes in the size of the simulation cube for high
magnetic ﬁeld simulations, and thus the values of m shown
in the following ﬁgures should be regarded as tentative. We
ﬁnd that the error bars for the structure function slope and

integrated quadrupole ratio modulus are consistent with the
variation seen in these statistics as the size of the simulation

4.2.1. Structure Function Slope

We calculate the structure function of our mock synchrotron
intensity maps according to Eq. 9 for all simulations (exam-
ples can be found in Figure 11). The slopes of these structure
functions are measured by performing a linear ﬁt to the struc-
ture function for radial separations between 20 and 50 pixels,
as this range corresponds to the inertial range of the simu-
lations, whilst avoiding the radial scales where the structure
functions begin to plateau. We express the structure function
slope via the variable m, which is the structure function slope
minus 1.

In Figure 6 we plot m against the sonic Mach number (left),
and the Alfvénic Mach number (right). Simulations with B =
0.1 are plotted as blue circles, simulations with B = 1 as
red stars, and the remaining simulations as green triangles.
We ﬁnd that the simulations fall into two distinct populations
in Figure 6a; with high magnetic ﬁeld simulations having a
larger value of m than low magnetic ﬁeld simulations. For
both high (B = 1, red) and low (B = 0.1, blue) magnetic
ﬁeld simulations, there does not appear to be any dependence
of m on the sonic Mach number.

We do ﬁnd a linear trend between m and the Alfvénic Mach
number, with some scatter about this trend due to the different
sonic Mach numbers of the simulations. This linear correla-
tion between m and the Alfvénic Mach number is also found
for γ = 1, and so we conclude that this result is not caused by
any dependence of m on γ. Hence, we ﬁnd that the structure
function slope is sensitive to the Alfvénic Mach number, and

so should be a useful statistic for determining this parameter
of turbulence.

4.2.2. Integrated Quadrupole Ratio

We calculate the quadrupole ratio for each simulation using
Eq. 12. To reduce the quadrupole ratio modulus plots to a
single number that can be compared to the sonic and Alfvénic
Mach numbers, we integrated the quadrupole ratio modulus
over the inertial range of the turbulence. For our simulations,
this means we integrated from ∼ 20 pixels, above the dissipa-
tion scale of the turbulence, to ∼ 100 pixels, below the energy
injection scale. This integration was performed over the log-
arithm of the radial separation, so that we calculated the area

under the plots of the quadrupole ratio modulus as they ap-
pear in Figure 5. We then normalized this area by dividing by
the number of points used in the calculation of the integral,
so that we essentially calculate the average of the quadrupole
ratio modulus over this radial separation range. We call this
quantity the integrated quadrupole ratio modulus.

In Figure 7 we plot the integrated quadrupole ratio mod-
ulus against the sonic Mach number (left), and Alfvénic
Mach number (right), similar to Figure 6. As was the case
for the structure function slope, we ﬁnd that the simula-
tions separate into two distinct groups when we plot the in-
tegrated quadrupole ratio modulus against sonic Mach num-
ber. The super-Alfvénic simulations (blue) have small in-
tegrated quadrupole ratio moduli for all sonic Mach num-
bers studied, with no discernible dependence on the value
of the sonic Mach number. This is because if the magnetic
ﬁeld is too weak to cause anisotropy in the observed syn-
chrotron intensity structures, then changing the sonic Mach
number of the turbulence, i.e. the ﬂuid velocity, will not intro-
duce any anisotropy. The sub-Alfvénic simulations (red and
green) have larger integrated quadrupole ratio moduli than the
super-Alfvénic simulations, because the large initial magnetic
ﬁeld strength produces anisotropic structures. There is also
some evidence of the integrated quadrupole ratio modulus de-
pending on the sonic Mach number for sub-Alfvénic simula-
tions (red data points). This dependence is clearest for small
Alfvénic Mach numbers, where the integrated quadrupole ra-
tio modulus decreases with increasing sonic Mach number.
This occurs because increasing the sonic Mach number cor-
responds to faster ﬂuid motions, and these motions can tear
apart and redirect ﬁlaments of ionized gas, thus decreasing
the observed anisotropy. However, the integrated quadrupole
ratio modulus only decreases with sonic Mach number up to
a sonic Mach number of about 4; above this sonic Mach num-
ber there is no clear correlation between these variables. This
could indicate that there is a limit to how much anisotropy
can be erased by supersonic ﬂuid motions. We also ﬁnd that
there is a linear correlation between the integrated quadrupole
ratio modulus and the Alfvénic Mach number, with the scat-
ter likely being caused by the different sonic Mach numbers
of the simulations. In summary, we ﬁnd that the integrated
quadrupole ratio modulus is sensitive to the Alfvénic Mach
number, with some mild dependence on the sonic Mach num-
ber, and so it is a useful statistic to use when trying to charac-

4.3. Dependence of Statistics on Line of Sight

The results shown so far have all been produced for lines of
sight that are perpendicular to the mean magnetic ﬁeld of the
simulation. This represents the optimal scenario for observ-
ing the effect of the magnetic ﬁeld, as we are best able to see
the anisotropy that is introduced by the magnetic ﬁeld. How-
ever, for a line of sight that is parallel to the mean magnetic
ﬁeld, we should not observe any clear anisotropy, and thus the
statistics we have examined should depend upon the orienta-
tion of the mean magnetic ﬁeld relative to our line of sight.
In this section we examine the dependence of the statistics
studied so far on the relative orientation of the mean magnetic
ﬁeld. We perform this study by creating mock synchrotron
intensity maps for different lines of sight into the simulation
cubes, as described in Section 3, using γ = 2. We then cal-
culate the structure function slope and integrated quadrupole
ratio modulus for each map produced (skewness and kurtosis
are examined in Appendix B). If a statistic is particularly sen-
sitive to the relative orientation of the mean magnetic ﬁeld,
then this could allow us to use this statistic to determine what
the relative orientation is. We also study whether these statis-
tics maintain sensitivity to the sonic and Alfvénic Mach num-
bers of the turbulence for different lines of sight. Because the
statistics we calculate in this section are calculated from sub-
cubes, not the full simulation cubes, the value of the statistics
will differ from those calculated in Section 4.2. As the results
of Section 4.2 were calculated using more data, they are more
reliable, and so take precedence whenever there is a conﬂict
between the results of this section and prior results.

4.3.1. Structure Function Slope

In Figure 8 we plot m against the relative angle between
the line of sight and the mean magnetic ﬁeld, for low mag-
netic ﬁeld simulations on the left, and high magnetic ﬁeld
simulations on the right. A relative angle of 0◦ means that
the line of sight is parallel to the mean magnetic ﬁeld, and an
angle of 90◦ means the line of sight is perpendicular to the
mean magnetic ﬁeld. We ﬁnd that m does not show any clear
dependence on the relative orientation of the mean magnetic
ﬁeld for low magnetic ﬁeld simulations. We also ﬁnd that
the structure function slope tends to increase as the line of
sight becomes more perpendicular to the mean magnetic ﬁeld
for high magnetic ﬁeld simulations. This result is expected,
as Figure 6 demonstrates that simulations with a strong mag-
netic ﬁeld perpendicular to the line of sight, which are sub-
Alfvénic, should have larger values of m than simulations
with a weak magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the line of sight.
As the component of the magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to our
line of sight increases as the line of sight becomes more per-
pendicular to the mean magnetic ﬁeld, we expect to see m
increase as well. Finally, we ﬁnd that m loses sensitivity to
the Alfvénic Mach number as the line of sight becomes paral-
lel to the mean magnetic ﬁeld. Hence, the structure function
slope of synchrotron intensity is only a useful statistic if the
magnetic ﬁeld strength perpendicular to our line of sight is
sufﬁciently strong.

4.3.2. Integrated Quadrupole Ratio

In Figure 9 we plot the integrated quadrupole ratio modu-
lus against the relative angle between the line of sight and the
mean magnetic ﬁeld, for low magnetic ﬁeld simulations on

on the results of Section 4.2.2, it can only be used to constrain
the sonic Mach number if the component of the magnetic ﬁeld
perpendicular to the line of sight is very strong, and the turbu-
lence is sub- to transonic.

the left, and for high magnetic ﬁeld simulations on the right.
The same simulations are used as in Figure 8. As was found
for m, the integrated quadrupole ratio modulus does not show
any clear dependence on the orientation of the mean magnetic
ﬁeld relative to the line of sight for low magnetic ﬁeld simu-
lations. This is because these simulations do not exhibit much
anisotropy due to their weak magnetic ﬁelds, and so the statis-
tics calculated should be approximately the same for all lines
of sight. The value of the integrated quadrupole ratio modulus
remains non-zero even for lines of sight parallel to the mean
magnetic ﬁeld because of statistical effects. We also ﬁnd that
for simulations with a strong mean magnetic ﬁeld, the inte-
grated quadrupole ratio modulus increases as the line of sight
becomes more perpendicular to the mean magnetic ﬁeld. This
occurs because more anisotropy is visible as the line of sight
becomes more perpendicular to the mean magnetic ﬁeld, as
expected.

We observe that the integrated quadrupole ratio modulus
does not exhibit any clear dependence on the sonic Mach
number for any of the lines of sight studied, and that it loses
all dependence on the Alfvénic Mach number when the line of
sight is parallel to the mean magnetic ﬁeld. Thus, we conclude
that the integrated quadrupole ratio modulus can only be used
to constrain the Alfvénic Mach number if the magnetic ﬁeld
perpendicular to the line of sight is sufﬁciently strong. Based

As shown in Section 4.1, the NCF of synchrotron intensity
is approximately independent of γ for γ values typical of the
Milky Way, between 1.5 and 2.5, and for all regimes of tur-
bulence. This means that the NCF of synchrotron intensity is
a useful statistic for comparing analytical, numerical and ob-
servational studies of synchrotron emission, as assumptions
(such as assuming that γ = 2) can be made without inﬂuenc-
ing the analysis.

Similarly, in Appendix A the structure function slope and
integrated quadrupole ratio modulus were shown to weakly
depend on γ, in general, for values of γ typical of the Milky
Way. Thus, statistics measured from observations can be com-
pared to those simulated for γ = 2, as derived properties
of turbulence would only be slightly improved by comparing
measured statistics to those simulated for the observed value
of γ. The exception to this is the structure function slope for
supersonic, super-Alfvénic turbulence, which exhibits signif-
icant dependence on γ. If this statistic is to be applied to an
observation of turbulence that may be in this regime, then it
is necessary to measure the value of γ, so that the observed
statistics can be compared to simulated statistics for the same
value of γ.

In Appendix B we ﬁnd that the skewness and kurtosis
of synchrotron intensity have no clear dependence on sonic
Mach number, and only a weak dependence on the Alfvénic
Mach number. As these statistics are not very sensitive to
these Mach numbers, they are not useful statistics for our pur-
poses. This illustrates that the skewness and kurtosis of syn-
chrotron intensity behave differently to the skewness and kur-
tosis of the observed polarisation gradient, which were shown
by Burkhart et al. (2012) to be sensitive to the sonic Mach
number. This difference arises because the total synchrotron
intensity is only sensitive to the magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular
to the line of sight, whereas the polarisation gradient is largely
caused by rotation of the plane of polarisation, which traces
the electron density and the magnetic ﬁeld parallel to our line
of sight.

The structure function slope of synchrotron intensity, how-
ever, is sensitive to the Alfvénic Mach number, and the in-
tegrated quadrupole ratio modulus is also sensitive to the
Alfvénic Mach number, with some dependence on the sonic
Mach number. These two statistics present the greatest poten-
tial for determining the properties of turbulence from obser-
vations of synchrotron ﬂuctuations. However, the dependence
of the structure function slope on the Alfvénic Mach number
should be regarded as tentative, as we found that the structure
function slope was sensitive to changes in the simulation size
in Appendix C. We believe that the measured values of the
structure function slope are sensitive to changes in the size of
the simulation cube because the nonlocality of MHD turbu-
lence can cause the measured value of m to differ from the
true value, due to improper formation of the inertial range of
the turbulence (Beresnyak & Lazarian 2009). For example,
Kritsuk et al. (2007) found that simulations with 2048 pixels
on each side were required to observe the inertial range for
compressible hydrodynamic turbulence, and so simulations
of at least this size are likely required to observe the inertial
range in simulations of MHD turbulence, and hence to mea-

sure m reliably.

Alfvenic Mach Number

FIG. 10.— The mean ratio of the random magnetic ﬁeld strength to the

is small for sub-Alfvénic simulations because there is a strong
mean magnetic ﬁeld, and the ratio is close to one for super-
Alfvénic simulations because there is a small, mostly random
magnetic ﬁeld. Hence, we should be able to deduce the ra-
tio of the random to total magnetic ﬁeld strength once the
Alfvénic Mach number is known. It is possible that other pa-
rameters of turbulence can also be determined from the sonic
or Alfvénic Mach numbers.

We still need to consider whether the structure function
slope and integrated quadrupole ratio modulus provide mean-
ingful constraints on the sonic and Alfvénic Mach numbers,
if applied to current observations of diffuse synchrotron in-
tensity.
In Appendix D we study how observational noise
and angular resolution affect the measured structure function
slope and integrated quadrupole ratio modulus. We found
that a signal-to-noise ratio of 30, and an angular resolution
of less than 7 pixels were required for the structure function
slope and integrated quadrupole ratio modulus to distinguish
regimes of turbulence. We require an angular resolution that
is capable of resolving the outer-scale of turbulence, and a sig-
niﬁcant portion of the inertial range of the turbulence, so that
the turbulent cascade is resolved spatially. Haverkorn et al.
(2008) found that the outer scale of turbulence in the warm
ionized medium inside the spiral arms of the Milky Way is
on the order of a few pc, say 3 pc, and so we estimate that a
spatial resolution of 0.3 pc seems capable of resolving syn-
chrotron ﬂuctuations. For an emitting region that is 2 kpc
away, this translates to an angular resolution of 31 arcseconds.
This is in good agreement with our estimate of 21 arc seconds
in Appendix D.1.2, based on the requirement that the struc-
ture function slope and integrated quadrupole ratio modulus
can distinguish between different regimes of turbulence.

To calculate the sensitivity that is required to observe syn-
chrotron ﬂuctuations, we need to consider resolving local
maxima and minima in the synchrotron intensity, as the signal
we are interested in is the difference in intensity between these
maxima and minima. For a pathlength of 2 kpc through a tur-
bulent synchrotron emitting medium, where the mean value
of B⊥ is 3 µG, the local maxima of synchrotron intensity ob-
served at a frequency of 1.4 GHz and with γ = 1.7 should
be 64 µJy/beam, at a resolution of 21 arc seconds. For ﬂuc-

Additionally, the relative orientation of the mean magnetic
ﬁeld relative to the line of sight is a third variable that needs
to be determined. Not only does this relative orientation af-
fect the values of the structure function slope and integrated
quadrupole ratio modulus, but it can also remove the sensi-
tivity of these statistics to the Mach numbers. For example,
when the line of sight is parallel to the mean magnetic ﬁeld,
the integrated quadrupole ratio modulus has no dependence
on either Mach number. Thus, the number of useful statistics
that we can obtain from observations of synchrotron intensity
can decrease if the line of sight is parallel to the mean mag-
netic ﬁeld, making it more difﬁcult to determine the properties
of the turbulence. This occurs because there is a degeneracy
between a weak magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the line of
sight, and a strong magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the line of sight.
As a result of this degeneracy, it is only possible to use the
synchrotron intensity statistics discussed in this paper to de-
termine the properties of an observed turbulent region if we
know a priori that the magnetic ﬁeld in that region is not par-
allel to our line of sight. This could be conﬁrmed by observing
polarization rotation measures towards pulsars or extragalac-
tic sources, the Zeeman splitting of spectral lines, starlight
polarized by intervening dust grains, or polarized thermal dust
emission.

If the orientation of the magnetic ﬁeld is not known, then
we must study other properties of the observed synchrotron
emission, such as its polarization, to break this degeneracy,
and determine the properties of the observed turbulence. As
Burkhart et al. (2012) have shown that the skewness and kur-
tosis of the observed polarization gradient are related to the
sonic Mach number of the turbulence, we believe that an-
alyzing the statistics of diffuse polarized synchrotron emis-
sion will enable us to determine the properties of an observed
turbulent, synchrotron emitting region. In a future paper we
will extend the work of Burkhart et al. (2012) by calculating
the skewness, kurtosis, structure function slope and integrated
quadrupole ratio modulus of the polarization gradient, and
other new polarization diagnostics, of diffuse, polarized syn-
chrotron emission. This study will hopefully produce many
more useful statistics to break the degeneracies that currently
exist.

It is possible that the statistics calculated in this paper de-
pend on properties of the turbulence other than the sonic and
Alfvénic Mach numbers, for example the compressibility of
the plasma, and the ratio of the random to total magnetic ﬁeld
strengths. Although we are not aware of any formula that
could be used to calculate the compressibility of the turbu-
lence in our simulations, it is possible to calculate the ratio of
the random to total magnetic ﬁeld. Shown in Figure 10 is a
plot of the mean ratio of the random to total magnetic ﬁeld
strength as a function of the Alfvénic Mach number, for all of
the simulations in Table 1. The strength of the random com-
ponent of the magnetic ﬁeld was determined by subtracting
the mean magnetic ﬁeld in each of the Cartesian directions
from the magnetic ﬁeld vector at each pixel, and then calcu-
lating the magnitude of the resulting random magnetic ﬁeld
vector. The random magnetic ﬁeld strength at each pixel was
then divided by the strength of the total magnetic ﬁeld at that
pixel, and the average ratio of the random to total magnetic
ﬁeld strength calculated over all pixels.

We ﬁnd that there is a monotonic relationship between the
ratio of the random magnetic ﬁeld strength to the total mag-
netic ﬁeld strength and the Alfvénic Mach number. The ratio

tuations in synchrotron intensity of 50%, we need to resolve
ﬂuctuations in intensity of 32 µJy/beam with a signal-to-noise
ratio of 30, and hence the required sensitivity is on the order
of 1 µJy/beam. To obtain a more optimistic estimate, we con-
sider a pathlength of 5 kpc where the mean value of B⊥ is
5 µG. For these values, the required sensitivity is 7 µJy/beam.
There are no publicly available observations of diffuse syn-
chrotron emission with the required combination of sensitivity
and angular resolution, however the Square Kilometre Array
could be capable of achieving this combination.

6. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

We have tested the theory of synchrotron ﬂuctuations devel-
oped by Lazarian & Pogosyan (2012) by applying it to mock
observations of diffuse synchrotron emission. We have also
compared statistics of the ﬂuctuations in synchrotron intensity
to the properties of the turbulence, to investigate how proper-
ties of interstellar turbulence can be deduced from observa-
tions of diffuse synchrotron emission.

We found that the NCF of the synchrotron intensity maps
does depend on γ, and hence on the cosmic ray energy spec-
tral index, in general. Thus, the common assumption that
γ = 2 made in earlier papers is only valid for the subsonic
and super-Alfvénic, or supersonic and sub-Alfvénic regimes
of turbulence. However, for γ values typically observed in the
Milky Way, between 1.5 and 2.5, the NCF of synchrotron in-
tensity varies little, and so independence of γ can be assumed.
We have also found that the anisotropy present in maps of dif-
fuse synchrotron emission is well characterized by the ratio of
the quadrupole to monopole moments of the normalized two-
dimensional structure function of the synchrotron intensity, as
predicted by Lazarian & Pogosyan (2012).

We have studied the dependence of the structure function
slope and integrated quadrupole ratio modulus on γ, the sonic
and Alfvénic Mach numbers, and the relative orientation of
the mean magnetic ﬁeld relative to our line of sight for the
mock synchrotron maps produced from our MHD simula-
tions. We ﬁnd that, in general, these statistics weakly de-
pend on γ for values of γ typical of the Milky Way, and
hence measured statistics can be compared to simulated statis-
tics obtained for γ = 2 to determine the properties of tur-
bulence in the observed region. The exceptional case is the
structure function slope for supersonic, super-Alfvénic tur-
bulence, which decreases with increasing γ. If the structure
function slope is to be applied to observations of turbulence in
this regime, then the value of γ must be measured and taken
into account. Although we found that the skewness and kur-
tosis of synchrotron intensity are not sensitive to the sonic
and Alfvénic Mach numbers, the structure function slope was
found to be sensitive to the Alfvénic Mach number, and the

integrated quadrupole ratio modulus was found to be sensi-
tive to the Alfvénic Mach number, with some dependence on
the sonic Mach number.

However, because the relative orientation of the mean mag-
netic ﬁeld in the emitting region relative to the line of sight
has a strong effect on the measured statistics, it is not possi-
ble to determine the sonic and Alfvénic Mach numbers of the
turbulence in the synchrotron emitting region unless we have
prior knowledge of the magnetic ﬁeld orientation, which may
be obtained by observing the rotation measures of pulsars, for
instance.
If this prior knowledge is not available, then we
may be able to analyze the polarization of the observed syn-
chrotron emission to break these parameter degeneracies. In
a future paper we will investigate how observations of the po-
larization gradients, and other polarization diagnostics, can
help to constrain the properties of interstellar magnetized tur-
bulence.

Finally, we estimate that a signal-to-noise ratio of 30, an an-
gular resolution of 21 arc seconds (one tenth of the outer scale
of turbulence) and a sensitivity of 1 µJy/beam are necessary to
conduct a statistical analysis of the ﬂuctuations in synchrotron
intensity. These criteria may be met by the Square Kilometre
Array, facilitating a study of how the magnetized turbulence
in the Milky Way varies with Galactic latitude and longitude.

APPENDIX

APPENDIX A: γ DEPENDENCE OF THE STRUCTURE FUNCTION AND QUADRUPOLE RATIO

In this section we examine how changes in γ affect the structure function and integrated quadrupole ratio modulus, for γ values
between 1 and 4, in increments of 0.5. Knowledge of the γ dependence of these statistics will aid in their interpretation. Example
structure functions are shown in Figure 11 for weak magnetic ﬁeld simulations (top row), and high magnetic ﬁeld simulations
(bottom row). Supersonic simulations are in the left column, and subsonic simulations are in the right column. γ values of 1, 2, 3
and 4 are colored blue, green, red and cyan respectively.

We ﬁnd that the structure functions for simulations with a high magnetic ﬁeld have more γ dependence in their amplitude
than simulations with a low magnetic ﬁeld. This is simply because the synchrotron intensity is calculated via the magnetic ﬁeld
strength perpendicular to our line of sight, raised to the power of γ. Thus, for high magnetic ﬁeld simulations, increasing γ leads
to an increase in I, and hence an increase in the structure function amplitude. The structure function amplitudes of low magnetic
ﬁeld simulations exhibit some γ dependence, because changing γ changes the contrast in the observed synchrotron intensities.

between 1.5 and 2.5. Supersonic, super-Alfvénic simulations are the exception, however, as for these simulations m decreases

with increasing γ. In Figures 12c) and d) we show the sum of the squared residuals of the linear ﬁts used to calculate m, to
demonstrate that the quality of the linear ﬁt is similar for the simulations shown.

In Figure 13 we show plots of the integrated quadrupole ratio modulus against γ for simulations with an initial magnetic ﬁeld
strength of 0.1 (left), and 1 (right). For the low magnetic ﬁeld simulations, we ﬁnd that the integrated quadrupole ratio modulus
has little dependence on γ. For the high magnetic ﬁeld simulations, we ﬁnd that the integrated quadrupole ratio modulus of
supersonic simulations tends to decrease with increasing γ, whereas for trans- or subsonic simulations the integrated quadrupole
ratio modulus tends to increase with increasing γ. This is because the anisotropic structures in the supersonic simulations are
fainter than those in the trans- or subsonic simulations. Increasing the value of γ enhances the contrast between bright and faint
regions, making the anisotropic structures less prevalent for supersonic simulations, and more prevalent for subsonic simulations,
which causes the integrated quadrupole ratio modulus to depend on γ.

APPENDIX B: SKEWNESS AND KURTOSIS OF SYNCHROTRON INTENSITY

Motivated by Burkhart et al. (2009), who found that the skewness and kurtosis of thermal electron density traced the sonic
Mach number of their MHD simulations, we examined the skewness and kurtosis of our mock synchrotron intensity maps. The
purpose of this study is two-fold: to investigate whether the skewness and kurtosis of synchrotron intensity are also sensitive to
the sonic Mach number of our simulations, and to examine whether the skewness and kurtosis also depend on the Alfvénic Mach
number.

The skewness and kurtosis statistics are the third and fourth normalized moments of a distribution respectively, and characterize
how a probability distribution function deviates from a Gaussian. The skewness characterizes whether the distribution function
appears skewed to the left or right, with a positive skewness implying that the distribution has an elongated tail to the right, and
a negative skewness implies an elongated tail towards small values. In this study, we will calculate the biased skewness of the
mock synchrotron intensity distributions, given by

In Eq. B1, n is the total number of pixels in the image, < I > denotes the mean synchrotron intensity, and the sum is over
all pixels in the image. The kurtosis characterizes whether the distribution function is ﬂatter or more peaked than a Gaussian
distribution. A negative kurtosis implies that the distribution is ﬂatter than a Gaussian, and a positive kurtosis implies that
the distribution is more peaked than a Gaussian. We calculate the biased Fisher kurtosis of the mock synchrotron intensity
distributions, given by

For each simulation in Table 1, we produce plots of the skewness and kurtosis as a function of γ. Representative plots are shown

and d) high B simulations. The same simulations are used as in Figure 8.

in Figure 14, for low B simulations (left column) and high magnetic ﬁeld simulations (right column).

We ﬁnd that the skewness and kurtosis of most simulations depend on γ. In particular, the skewness of mock synchrotron inten-
sity appears to increase with increasing γ, with the more supersonic, super-Alfvénic simulations exhibiting greater dependence
on γ. This is because the shocks that are present in the supersonic simulations compress and amplify the magnetic ﬁeld. This
signiﬁcantly increases the synchrotron emissivity of the shocks, and produces an extended tail towards large synchrotron intensi-
ties in the synchrotron intensity distribution. Increasing the value of γ enhances this extended tail by stretching the distribution,
increasing the value of the skewness. The skewness of synchrotron intensity measured for high magnetic ﬁeld simulations does
not appear to have as strong a dependence on γ as the low magnetic ﬁeld simulations. This is likely because the greater magnetic
pressure resists the formation of shocks, so that the tail in the synchrotron intensity distribution is not as pronounced.

As found for skewness, the kurtosis of the synchrotron intensity for low magnetic ﬁeld, supersonic simulations exhibits a
strong γ dependence. This is because increasing γ extends the tails of the synchrotron intensity distribution by stretching the
distribution, without signiﬁcantly broadening the synchrotron intensity distribution, so that the synchrotron intensity distribution
is more peaked. Similarly, the kurtosis of synchrotron intensity for high magnetic ﬁeld simulations has a stronger dependence on
γ for supersonic simulations.

In Figure 15, we plot the skewness (top row) and kurtosis (bottom row) of the mock synchrotron intensity maps of all simula-
tions produced for γ = 2 against sonic Mach number (left column) and Alfvénic Mach number (right column). For both skewness
and kurtosis, we ﬁnd that there is a correlation with the Alfvénic Mach number, where simulations with a large Alfvénic Mach
number tend to have a larger skewness and kurtosis. However, this correlation is not very well deﬁned, as there is signiﬁcant
scatter in the skewness and kurtosis for both low and high magnetic ﬁeld simulations. For example, a skewness of 0.5 implies an
Alfvénic Mach number between 0.5 and 2.0. This covers many different regimes of turbulence, and so the skewness and kurtosis
statistics are not able to distinguish these regimes.

For the plots produced against sonic Mach number (15a and 15c), both skewness and kurtosis display little dependence on sonic
Mach number. When we partition the data into high magnetic ﬁeld simulations (B = 1, red) and low magnetic ﬁeld simulations
(B = 0.1, blue), we ﬁnd that for high magnetic ﬁeld simulations, there is no clear dependence of the skewness or kurtosis of
synchrotron intensity on the sonic Mach number. For low magnetic ﬁeld simulations, we ﬁnd that there is a weak correlation
between the skewness and kurtosis, and the sonic Mach number. This correlation implies that large sonic Mach numbers cause
an increase in the observed skewness and kurtosis.

However, considering that simulations with large sonic Mach numbers have stronger γ dependence than subsonic simulations,
and that skewness tends to increase with γ, it is possible that skewness only appears to depend on sonic Mach number for low
magnetic ﬁeld simulations because of the dependence of skewness on γ. This is supported by our observation that there is no
clear relationship between the skewness of synchrotron intensity maps produced using γ = 1 and sonic Mach number, for low
magnetic ﬁeld simulations. This ﬁnding also applies to the kurtosis of synchrotron intensity.

synchrotron intensity against c) sonic Mach number and d) Alfvénic Mach number for all simulations, and γ = 2. Simulations with B = 0.1 are plotted as blue
circles, simulations with B = 1 as red stars, and the remaining simulations as green triangles.

To summarize, we ﬁnd that the skewness and kurtosis of synchrotron intensity increase with increasing Alfvénic Mach number,
although this is a weak trend. Due to the dependence of skewness and kurtosis on γ, we ﬁnd that the skewness of synchrotron
intensity does not depend on sonic Mach number for high magnetic ﬁeld simulations, but does increase with sonic Mach number
for low magnetic ﬁeld simulations. These ﬁndings illustrate that the skewness of synchrotron intensity behaves differently to the
skewness of column density. Whereas Burkhart et al. (2009) found that the skewness of column density is sensitive to the sonic
Mach number, we ﬁnd that the skewness of synchrotron intensity is primarily sensitive to the Alfvénic Mach number, because
the synchrotron intensity is sensitive to the magnetic ﬁeld, but not to the thermal electron density.

B.1. Dependence of Skewness and Kurtosis on Line of Sight

In Figure 16, we plot the skewness (top row) and kurtosis (bottom row) as a function of the relative angle between the mean
magnetic ﬁeld and the line of sight. Low magnetic ﬁeld simulations are shown on the left, and high magnetic ﬁeld simulations
are on the right. The same simulations are used as for Figure 14.

We ﬁnd that neither skewness nor kurtosis exhibit a clear dependence on the relative orientation of the mean magnetic ﬁeld for
weak magnetic ﬁeld simulations. This is because there is little anisotropy in these simulations, and so the statistics should not
systematically depend on the orientation of the mean magnetic ﬁeld relative to the line of sight. Any variations in the skewness
or kurtosis as the line of sight changes are likely caused by the particular conﬁguration of the turbulence observed. For high
magnetic ﬁeld simulations, we ﬁnd that both the skewness and kurtosis decrease as the line of sight becomes more perpendicular
to the mean magnetic ﬁeld. This occurs because the mean synchrotron intensity increases as the line of sight becomes more
perpendicular to the mean magnetic ﬁeld, and the ﬂuctuations relative to the mean synchrotron intensity decrease.

Furthermore, we ﬁnd that skewness only shows a weak dependence on the Alfvénic Mach number of the simulations for lines
of sight that are almost perpendicular to the mean magnetic ﬁeld. Skewness does not exhibit any clear dependence on the sonic
Mach number for any line of sight, and kurtosis does not exhibit any clear dependence on either the sonic or Alfvénic Mach
numbers for any line of sight. From this, we conclude that the skewness and kurtosis of synchrotron intensity are not sensitive
tracers of the sonic or Alfvénic Mach numbers, and that they only possess weak dependence on the relative orientation of the
mean magnetic ﬁeld if the ﬁeld is strong.

APPENDIX C: DEPENDENCE OF STATISTICS ON SIMULATION SIZE

One way of testing whether the statistics calculated from simulations are reliable is to produce synchrotron intensity maps
using a subset of the entire simulation, to examine whether small changes in the size of the mock synchrotron map produce large
changes in the calculated statistics. If the statistics change drastically with small size changes, then the statistic has not converged
to its true value (which would be measured with a larger simulation cube), and the statistic is not reliable.

To conduct this test, we extract a sub-cube of side length s from the centre of each simulation, where s varies between 312

pixels and 512 pixels (corresponding to the full simulation). For each sub-cube, mock synchrotron maps are produced for lines
of sight along the y and z axes, and the skewness, kurtosis, structure function slope and integrated quadrupole ratio modulus of
synchrotron intensity are calculated for these maps. The statistics measured for lines of sight along the y and z axes are then
averaged to obtain the ﬁnal data point.

In Figure 17 we plot the skewness (top row) and kurtosis (bottom row) of the synchrotron intensity as a function of sub-cube
size. Low magnetic ﬁeld simulations are on the left, and high magnetic ﬁeld simulations on the right. We ﬁnd that the skewness
and kurtosis do not change signiﬁcantly with small changes in the sub-cube size for any simulation, and that there are only a
couple of simulations that do not appear to have converged to their ﬁnal value. We hence conclude that the skewness and kurtosis
of synchrotron intensity are reliably measured in our simulations.

The structure function slope is plotted as a function of sub-cube size in Figure 18 (top row), with low magnetic ﬁeld simulations
on the left, and high magnetic ﬁeld simulations on the right. We ﬁnd that some high magnetic ﬁeld simulations do exhibit
signiﬁcant variations in the structure function slope for small changes in the sub-cube size, and hence the values of the structure
function slope measured for these simulations are unreliable. For low magnetic ﬁeld simulations, the structure function slope
does not undergo signiﬁcant variations, implying that the measured values of the structure function slope are reliable for these
simulations. Larger simulations with strong magnetic ﬁelds must be run to obtain reliable values for the structure function slope,
and results involving the structure function slope presented in this paper should hence be regarded as tentative.

In the bottom row of Figure 18 we plot the integrated quadrupole ratio modulus as a function of sub-cube size. We ﬁnd
that simulations with a high magnetic ﬁeld strength and low sonic Mach number, namely the Ms0.87Ma0.7 and Ms0.48Ma0.65
simulations, have not yet converged, or are only just beginning to converge to a ﬁnal value. Otherwise, all simulations appear to
plateau, and no simulations show signiﬁcant changes in the integrated quadrupole ratio for small changes in size about the full
simulation size. We conclude that our measurements of the integrated quadrupole ratio are reliable.

APPENDIX D: IMPLEMENTATION OF OBSERVATIONAL EFFECTS

The synchrotron maps produced by the method in Section 3 are idealized, in the sense that they do not consider the spectral
resolution, angular resolution, instrumental noise of the telescope, or the bandwidth used to make the ﬁnal synchrotron image.
In Appendix D.1 we will study how each of these observational effects inﬂuences the calculated statistics, with the aim of
determining the angular resolution and sensitivity required to apply statistics of synchrotron ﬂuctuations to real observations.
For each effect, we consider observations being made at a central frequency of 1.4 GHz, and use Eq. 3 to scale the synchrotron
intensity correspondingly. We assume γ = 2 for all observational effects studied.

To implement the effects of spectral resolution and bandwidth, we consider a spectral channel of ﬁnite width centred on 1.4
GHz. This channel is divided up into 20 equal sub-channels, and a synchrotron map is created for each sub-channel via Eq. 17.
The synchrotron map for the full channel is then obtained by averaging over the individual sub-channel maps. For this effect,
we examine 50 different bandwidths. The values for these widths are equally spaced between 0.1 and 300 MHz, inclusive. The

lower limit of this range is comparable to the spectral resolution of current instrumentation; for example, the Galactic ALFA
Continuum Transit Survey (GALFACTS) has a spectral resolution of 0.4 MHz (Taylor & Salter 2010). The upper limit is the
same as the bandwidth of the GALFACTS survey. The interpretation of these results hence changes throughout the range of
spectral channel widths. Towards the lower limit, we are calculating the synchrotron intensity map that would be observed in a
single spectral channel of ﬁnite spectral resolution, where the individual channel widths are far narrower than normally recorded
in continuum observations. Towards the upper limit, we integrate over numerous images of synchrotron intensity to obtain a
single, high signal-to-noise image.

To emulate different angular resolutions, we convolve the idealized synchrotron maps with a Gaussian kernel. We consider 20
different standard deviations for this kernel, that start from 1 pixel and go up to 50 pixels in equal increments. To examine the
effect of noise, we produce randomly generated 512×512 maps of Gaussian noise, with varying noise amplitudes. We determined
the standard deviation of the Gaussian noise by generating linearly spaced numbers between 0.02 and 0.5, representing the
standard deviation of the noise expressed as a fraction of the median synchrotron intensity, i.e. a noise-to-signal ratio. We then
multiplied each of these numbers by the median synchrotron intensity of a map to determine the standard deviation of the noise
for that map. The resultant noise map is then added onto the idealized synchrotron intensity map.

Additionally, we studied the more realistic case where both noise and angular resolution affect the observed synchrotron map
by ﬁrst adding a noise map to the idealized synchrotron intensity map, and then smoothing to a ﬁnal resolution of 1.6 pixels.
This resolution was chosen because surveys are typically produced to have 3 pixels across the full-width at half maximum of the
telescope beam. Smoothing the synchrotron map changes how the noise contributes to the ﬁnal image, and so we calculate the
ﬁnal noise level in the image by smoothing the idealized synchrotron intensity map to the same resolution as the ﬁnal image, and
subtracting the idealized map from the ﬁnal map. This produces a map of the contribution of the noise to the ﬁnal image, and we
calculate the standard deviation of this map to determine the noise level in the smoothed image. For this study, we consider 25
noise-to-signal ratios (relative to the original, unsmoothed image) that are linearly spaced between 0.02 and 0.7.

D.1. Probing Observational Effects on Statistics

D.1.1. Spectral Resolution and Bandwidth

We ﬁnd that the spectral resolution and bandwidth of the observations have no effect on the skewness, kurtosis, structure
function slope or integrated quadrupole ratio modulus for bandwidths up to 300 MHz, for all simulations. Thus, the statistics
measured for a synchrotron map are very accurate, and not inﬂuenced by integrating the observed signal over the bandwidth, nor
are they affected by the spectral resolution. Additionally, we have tested the impact of changing the central observing frequency
between 0.8 GHz and 2.8 GHz, on the skewness, kurtosis, structure function slope and integrated quadrupole ratio modulus, and
found that all of these statistics are independent of the observing frequency. It is possible that these statistics might change with
the observing frequency, or the bandwidth, if γ depends on frequency. If this is the case, then the statistics can be analysed in
terms of how each statistic depends on γ.

D.1.2. Angular Resolution

In Figure 19 we provide an example of a mock synchrotron intensity map smoothed to a resolution of 26.8 pixels (right), using
the Ms0.48Ma0.65 simulation, a line of sight perpendicular to the mean magnetic ﬁeld, and γ = 2. We can convert the ﬁnal
resolution of this map into angular units by equating the outer scale of turbulence of the simulations (the scale at which energy
is injected into the ﬂuid motions) to the outer scale of turbulence observed in the Milky Way. Haverkorn et al. (2008) found that
the outer scale of turbulence in the spiral arms of the Milky Way is a few pc, and hence we can approximate that 100 pixels in
our simulations corresponds to 3 pc. For an emitting region that is 2 kpc away, this means that each pixel is approximately 3 arc
seconds, and thus the synchrotron map shown on the right of Figure 19 has been smoothed to 81 arc second resolution.

In Figure 20 we plot m (top row) and the integrated quadrupole ratio modulus (bottom row) against the standard deviation of
the Gaussian proﬁle used to smooth the mock synchrotron intensity maps. Results for low magnetic ﬁeld simulations are shown

on the left, and for high magnetic ﬁeld simulations on the right. We ﬁnd that smoothing, and hence the angular resolution of a
telescope, has a strong effect on the structure function slope, as the value of m quickly deviates from its ‘true’ value and tends
towards a value of 1 for all simulations. Thus, if the angular resolution of the telescope is too poor, above 7 pixels (21 arc seconds,
for an emitting region 2 kpc away), say, then the structure function slope will no longer be able to distinguish different regimes
of turbulence. We discuss the constraints this places on the angular resolution of observations hoping to make use of the structure
function slope to determine properties of turbulence in Section 5.

We ﬁnd that angular resolution does not have as strong an effect on the integrated quadrupole ratio modulus as on m. For all
simulations, there is a steady increase in the integrated quadrupole ratio modulus as the angular resolution becomes poorer. This
is likely because smoothing the synchrotron intensity maps causes anisotropy that exists on scales below 20 pixels to move into
the integration range used to calculate the integrated quadrupole ratio modulus. As the quadrupole ratio tends to be larger on
scales below 20 pixels than above 20 pixels, this leads to a gradual increase in the integrated quadrupole ratio modulus.

D.1.3. Noise

In Figure 21 we provide an example of a mock synchrotron intensity map to which noise has been added. The original mock
synchrotron map produced with the Ms0.48Ma0.65 simulation, for a line of sight perpendicular to the mean magnetic ﬁeld and
γ = 2, is shown on the left. The mock synchrotron intensity map after Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 27% of the
median synchrotron intensity has been added is shown on the right.

We plot m (top row) and the integrated quadrupole ratio modulus (bottom row) against the standard deviation of the noise
(expressed as a fraction of the median synchrotron intensity of a simulation) in Figure 22, for the same simulations as in Figure
20. We ﬁnd that m decreases towards −1 as the noise level is increased, for all simulations. This is because the Gaussian
noise quickly starts to dominate the statistics of the image, and so the measured structure function slope tends towards the
slope measured for pure Gaussian noise, namely zero. We also ﬁnd that the values of m are lower for the high magnetic ﬁeld
simulations than the low magnetic ﬁeld simulations, for a given noise level, the opposite of what was found for the original mock
synchrotron intensity maps. This is likely because the median synchrotron intensity of the mock synchrotron intensity maps
produced for the high magnetic ﬁeld simulations is greater than that for the low magnetic ﬁeld simulations, meaning that the
standard deviation of the noise generated for high magnetic ﬁeld simulations is larger than the standard deviation used for low
magnetic ﬁeld simulations.

We also ﬁnd that the integrated quadrupole ratio modulus depends strongly on the noise level if the magnetic ﬁeld strength
is large, but only weakly if the magnetic ﬁeld strength is small. In both cases, the integrated quadrupole ratio modulus tends
towards a value of 0.01, which we conﬁrmed is the result obtained for pure Gaussian noise.

D.1.4. Noise and Angular Resolution

In Figure 23 we plot m (top row) and the integrated quadrupole ratio modulus (bottom row) as a function of the ﬁnal noise
level in the image, expressed as a fraction of the median synchrotron intensity of the ﬁnal image, for a ﬁxed resolution of 1.6
pixels (approximately 5 arc seconds), and the same simulations as in Figure 20.

Firstly, we ﬁnd that the noise level in the smoothed images is smaller than the initial noise level by about a factor of four,
because the smoothing has averaged much of the noise. As for the case where no smoothing was performed, we ﬁnd that both
m and the integrated quadrupole ratio modulus decrease as the noise level increases. These statistics decrease with noise level
much more rapidly if the mean magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the line of sight is large.

From these plots, we deduce that a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 20 would be required for the measured structure function
slope and integrated quadrupole ratio to be able to distinguish different regimes of turbulence. However signal-to-noise ratios

Noise-to-Signal Ratio

FIG. 23.— Same as Fig. 20, but plotting the structure function slope minus 1, (m, top row), and the integrated quadrupole ratio (bottom row) as a function of

above 30 would be ideal, as this would allow for a more accurate determination of the properties of turbulence.
