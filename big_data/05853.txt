Abstract

Induced charge electrophoresis of a conducting cylinder suspended in a non-conducting

cylindrical pore is theoretically analyzed, and a micromotor is proposed utilizing the cylinder

rotation. The cylinder velocities are analytically obtained in the Dirichlet and the Neumann

boundary conditions of the electric ﬁeld on the cylindrical pore. The results show that the cylinder

not only translates but also rotates when it is eccentric with respect to the cylindrical pore.

The inﬂuences of a number of parameters on the cylinder velocities are characterized in detail.

The cylinder trajectories show that the cylinder approaches and rests at certain positions within

the cylindrical pore. The analysis reveals that the Dirichlet boundary condition predicts more

reasonable cylinder behaviors than the Neumann boundary condition. The proposed micromotor

is capable of working under a heavy load with a high rotational velocity when the eccentricity is

large and the applied electric ﬁeld is strong.

INTRODUCTION

Particle and ﬂuid manipulations utilizing electric ﬁelds have been extensively studied

due to their advantages in various application areas, including micro/nanoﬂuidics [1–3],

chemistry [4, 5], biology [6–8], biomedicine [9, 10], etc. Among these manipulation methods,

induced charge electrophoresis (ICEP) is receiving increasingly signiﬁcant interests because

of its great potential in various applications, ranging from the manipulations of droplets

[11, 12] and particles [13–15], to the device development in lab-on-a-chip systems, e.g.

micromixers [16–18], microvalves [19, 20] and micromotors [21, 22]. When a conducting

(ideally polarizable) particle is subjected an external electric ﬁeld, it polarizes immediately.

The polarization surface charges attract counterions in the electrolyte solution, establishing

an induced electric double layer (EDL). The interactions between the applied electric ﬁeld

and the induced EDL lead to a ﬂuid ﬂow, known as induced charge electroosmosis (ICEO).

The particle motions due to ICEO is known as induced charge electrophoresis (ICEP). The

ICEP velocity is a quadratic function of the electric ﬁeld strength because the zeta potential

of the conducting (ideally polarizable) particle is induced by the applied electric ﬁeld [23],

ζi = −φ +ZA

φdA/A,

(1)

where ζi is the induced zeta potential of the conducting particle, φ is the applied electrical

potential on the particle surface, A is the area of the particle surface.

Pioneering studies of the ICEP were carried out in colloid science decades ago [24–26].

Thanks to the rapid advancement in material science and nanotechnology, which provides

various kinds of conducting particles for micro/nanoﬂuidics [27–30], the ICEP regains

researchers’ attentions in recent years [2, 31, 32]. As the particles are often bounded or

contained in channels or chambers in reality, the boundary eﬀect is of signiﬁcant importance

in the relevant applications. Some studies have been conducted considering the planer

wall eﬀect in the ICEP motion of particles [33–35]. The repulsion or attraction eﬀects of the

planar wall on diﬀerent particles, ranging from cylinders [34, 36], Janus particles [33], spheres

[34, 37], to ellipsoids [35], have been reported. However, in such studies, the walls are all

straight and uncharged. The ICEP behavior of particles near a curved and/or charged non-

conducting wall is still lack of knowledge. In an eﬀort to improve the physical insights of this

problem, we hereby carry out a comprehensive study on the ICEP motion of a conducting

cylinder suspended in a non-conducting cylindrical pore. The analytical evaluations on

2

the cylinder velocities reveal that the cylinder is not only driven into translation but also,

surprisingly, into rotation, when the cylinder and the cylindrical pore are eccentric.

The ICEP rotation of the cylinder presents a promising potential as a micromotor,

which has long been crucial in the development of micromachines for biomedicine [38, 39],

biochemistry [40], environmental science [41], etc., thus, remains a hot topic of scientiﬁc and

technological interests. Various micromotors have been proposed and studied [42–46]. Most

of such studies are centered on Janus particles [21, 46], segmented rods with diﬀerent metals

[42, 43], and microtubes with layer-by-layer deposited metals [44, 45]. Micromotors utilizing

ICEP rotation of Janus particles have also been proposed and studied. An ICEP micromotor

composed of three Janus particles has been proposed and theoretically analyzed years ago

[21]. Lately, the ICEP rotation of a doublet Janus particle has been experimentally captured

[22]. However, all these proposed structures are composed of diﬀerent materials, which are

complicated and bring fabrication challenges. We hereby propose a micromotor utilizing

the ICEP rotation of the cylinder in the cylindrical pore, which has advantages of simple

geometry and material property. Thus, it is easy to fabricate. The analysis shows that the

micromotor is capable of providing a large rotational velocity and bearing a heavy load. The

study could contribute to the understanding of the ICEP behavior of conducting cylinders

in non-conducting cylindrical pore, and provide helpful insights in micromotor development.

II. MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION

A two-dimensional (2D) conducting cylinder is suspended in a non-conducting cylindrical

pore ﬁlled with an electrolyte solution. A Cartesian coordinate system is introduced in which
the centers of the cylinder and the cylindrical pore are on the positive x−axis (Fig. 1). As
the cylinder and the cylindrical pore are commonly eccentric, a bipolar coordinate system

is deﬁned in the Cartesian coordinates [47],

x = a

sinh τ

cosh τ − cos σ

,

y = a

sin σ

cosh τ − cos σ

,

(2)

so as to conveniently describe the eccentric geometry (Fig. 1). Here −∞ < τ < ∞; 0 < σ ≤
2π; (τ, σ) denote the coordinates of the bipolar coordinate system; a is a positive constant in

the bipolar coordinates. The surfaces of the cylinder and the cylindrical pore are indicated

by τ = τi and τo, respectively, in the bipolar coordinates.

FIG. 1. Schematic illustration of the conducting cylinder suspended in the cylindrical pore. (±a, 0)
are the two foci of the bipolar coordinates; eτ and eσ are the unit vectors in the bipolar coordinates

that normal and tangent to the cylinder surface, respectively; τ = τi and τo indicate the surfaces of

the cylinder and the cylindrical pore, respectively; (a coth τi, 0) and (a coth τo, 0) are the centers

of the cylinder and the cylindrical pore, respectively, in the Cartesian coordinates; Ri = a/sinh τi

and Ro = a/sinh τo are the radii of the cylinder and the cylindrical pore, respectively; ˜ε is the

distance between the centers of the cylinder and the cylindrical pore. The uniform electric ﬁeld

−(E0 sin θ0ex + E0 cos θ0ey) is imposed, where the electric ﬁeld phase angle θ0 deﬁnes the direction
of the electric ﬁeld.

To quantitatively describe the eccentric geometry, two parameters, i.e. the radius ratio

Rr and the eccentricity ε, are introduced,

Rr =

Ri
Ro

,

ε =

˜ε

Ro − Ri

,

(3)

where Ri and Ro are the radii of the cylinder and the cylindrical pore, respectively; ˜ε is the

distance between the centers of the cylinder and the cylindrical pore (Fig. 1). When the

eccentricity ε decreases to zero, the cylinder and the cylindrical pore become concentric.

The ﬂuid outside the EDLs is electrically neutral, whose electrical potential φ is governed

by the Laplace equation,

The electric ﬁeld lines are expelled by the EDL on the cylinder, thus, the no-ﬂux condition

∇2φ = 0.

(4)

is applied,

at

τ = τi,

(5)

eτ · ∇φ = 0
4

where eτ is the unit vector normal to the cylinder surface in the bipolar coordinates (Fig.

1).

Given the uniformly applied electric ﬁeld −(E0 sin θ0ex + E0 cos θ0ey), the boundary

condition on the cylindrical pore is,

φ = E0a

sin σ cos θ0 + sinh τo sin θ0

cosh τo − cos σ

in the Dirichlet approach [48], or

(1 − cosh τo cos σ) sin θ0 − sinh τo sin σ cos θ0

(cosh τ0 − cos σ)2

at

τ = τo,

(7)

in the Neumann approach [49]. Both approaches lead to the uniform electric ﬁeld
−(E0 sin θ0ex + E0 cos θ0ey) in the ﬂuid ﬂow when the cylinder disappears, although Eq.
(7) does not deﬁne the tangential component of the electric ﬁeld gradient on the cylindrical

pore. This paper presents the derivation in the Dirichlet approach (Eq. (6)). For the

derivation in the Neumann approach (Eq. (7)), pleases reference to the Supplementary.

Solving Eq. (4) together with Eqs. (5) and (6), the electrical potential is obtained,

The electric ﬁeld exerts an electrical force on the ions within the EDLs and drives the
ions into motion. In the limit of thin EDL (∼ nm) [52] and small zeta potential (ζ < 25

and cylindrical pore, deﬁned by the Helmholtz-Smoluchowski formula,

(20)

where εw and µ are the dielectric permittivity and the viscosity of the electrolyte solution,

respectively; ζ is the zeta potential, given as ζi (Eq. (9)) and ζf for the conducting cylinder

and the non-conducting cylindrical pore, respectively.

Substituting Eqs. (9) and (10) into Eq. (20), the slip velocity on the cylinder is obtained.

Thus, the boundary condition of ﬂuid ﬂow on the cylinder is,

The ﬂuid ﬂow can be decomposed into two parts according to its linearity. First, we

consider the ﬂow due to the electrokinetic slip velocities on the stationary cylinder and

(19) into the ﬁrst term of Eq. (22) and Eq. (23) through Eq. (18). The expressions of the

Next,we consider the ﬂow due to the cylinder motion Uxex + Uyey + ΩRieσ, which arouses

drag forces and moment on the cylinder. The derivation of the drag forces and moment is

presented in the Supplementary.

Since the cylinder is in free suspension, the net force and moment exerted on it should

vanish [54],

Substituting the forces along the x−axis, i.e. Eqs. (15), (27), (S.44); along the y−axis,
i.e. Eqs. (16), (28), (S.45); and the moments, i.e. Eqs. (29), (S.46) into Eqs. (30), (31) and

Clearly, the cylinder velocities are trigonometric functions of the electric ﬁeld phase

angle θ0, which deﬁnes the direction of the electric ﬁeld (Fig. 1). The cylinder velocities

can be manipulated by changing θ0. Three factors contribute to the cylinder motion,

namely the electrostatic (ES) force due to the nonuniform local electric ﬁeld, the induced

charge electroosmotic (ICEO) ﬂow generated on the cylinder, the electroosmotic (EO) ﬂow

generated on the cylindrical pore. All these three factors contribute to Ux as indicated by

the ﬁrst, second, and third terms in Eq. (33) in the Dirichlet approach, or in (S.67) of the

Supplementary in the Neumann approach; while only ICEO and EO ﬂows contribute to Uy

and Ω as presented by the ﬁrst, and second terms in Eqs. (34) and (35) in the Dirichlet

approach, or in Eqs. (S.68) and (S.69) of the Supplementary in the Neumann approach.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Cylinder velocities

The inﬂuences of the radius ratio Rr and the eccentricity ε on the cylinder velocities

are characterized with the electric ﬁeld phase angle θ0 = π/6 and the dimensionless zeta
potential of the cylindrical pore ˜ζ = 1.0 in Figs. 2 ∼ 7. The inﬂuences of θ0 and ˜ζ on the
cylinder velocities are shown in Figs. S.1 ∼ S.3 of the Supplementary with Rr = ε = 0.5.
These ﬁgures demonstrate that three factors contributes to Ux, namely, the electrostatic

(ES) force (Figs. 2(a1), 2(b1), 3(a), S.1(a1) and S.1(b1)), the induced charge electroosmotic

(ICEO) ﬂow (Figs. 2(a2), 2(b2), 3(b), S.1(a2) and S.1(b2)) and the electroosmotic (EO)

ﬂow (Figs. 2(a3), 2(b3), 3(c), S.1(a3) and S.1(b3)); while two factors contribute to Uy and

Ω, i.e. the ICEO (Figs. 4(a1), 4(b1), 5(a), 6(a1), 6(b1), 7(a), S.2(a1), S.2(b1), S.3(a1) and

S.3(b1)) and EO ﬂows (Figs. 4(a2), 4(b2), 5(b), 6(a2), 6(b2), 7(b), S.2(a2), S.2(b2), S.3(a2)

and S.3(b2)). The magnitudes of the cylinder velocities derived in the Neumann approach

are larger than those derived in the Dirichlet approach, especially at large Rr (Figs. 3, 5 and
7). The ES component is irrelevant to ˜ζ and θ0, and the ICEO component is irrelevant to ˜ζ
but a trigonometric function of θ0 (Figs. S.1 ∼ S.3). The cylinder velocities vary in similar
trends with ˜ζ and θ0 in the two approaches (Figs. S.1 ∼ S.3).

Fig. 2 shows the variation of the cylinder velocity Ux with the radius ratio Rr at diﬀerent

eccentricities ε. The ES components of Ux derived in the Dirichlet and the Neumann

approaches follow the similar trends as Rr and ε increase (Figs. 2(a1) and 2(b1)). They

monotonically increase as ε increases, and show a parabolic variation as Rr increases. For

a better observation, Fig. 3(a) shows the variation of the ES component of Ux at ε = 0.5 in

both approaches. Clearly, the ES components of Ux obtained in these two approaches are

of the same order of magnitude although the Dirichlet approach leads to a faster decay as

Rr increases when Rr is large.

Compared to the ES component of Ux, the ICEO and the EO components of Ux are much

larger (Figs. 2 and 3). Moreover, unlike the ES component of Ux, these two components of

Ux vary signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in the two approaches. In the Dirichlet approach, the ICEO

component of Ux increases from zero and diminishes to zero as Rr increases (Fig. 2(a2));

while in the Neumann approach, it monotonically increases from zero as Rr increases (Fig.

2(b2)). The magnitude of the ICEO component of Ux in the Neumann approach is larger

than that in the Dirichlet approach, especially at large Rr (Fig. 3(b)). As ε increases, the

ICEO components of Ux in both approaches show monotonic increases.

As Rr increases, the EO component of Ux increases from negative to zero in the Dirichlet

approach (Fig. 2(a3)), while it approaches a constant value in the Neumann approach (Fig.

2(b3)). As ε increases, the magnitudes of the EO components of Ux in both approaches

monotonically decreases. Fig. 3(c) reveals that the magnitude of the EO components of Ux

in these two approaches are close at small Rr. As Rr increases, the magnitude of the EO

component of Ux in the Dirichlet approach diminishes to zero, while that in the Neumann

approach increases to a constant value. These two curves in the two approaches deviate

signiﬁcantly as Rr increases.

The net Ux depends on the relative magnitude of these three components. In the Dirichlet

approach, the net Ux is negative at small ε but increases from negative to positive at large ε

when Rr is small, and eventually approaches zero when Rr is reaching 1.0 (Fig. 2(a4)). While

in the Neumann approach, the net Ux increases from negative to positive as Rr increases.

Ux increases to positive at a small Rr when ε is large (Fig. 2(b4)). The magnitude of Ux

in the Neumann approach becomes signiﬁcantly larger than that in the Dirichlet approach

when Rr is larger than 0.8 (Fig. 3(d)).

Fig. 4 shows the variation of Uy with Rr at diﬀerent ε. The magnitudes of the ICEO

components of Uy obtained in both approaches increase as ε increases. As Rr increases, the

magnitude of the ICEO component of Uy in the Dirichlet approach increases from zero and

then decreases to zero with a peak value (Fig. 4(a1)), while that in the Neumann approach

monotonically increases (Fig. 4(b1)). Fig. 5(a) reveals that the magnitudes of the ICEO

component of Uy in the two approaches increase from the same value at Rr = 0.0. The

diﬀerence between them increases as Rr increases, and eventually become signiﬁcant at

large Rr.

As ε increases, the EO component of Uy in the Dirichlet approach increases from negative

to positive (Fig. 4(a2)), while that in the Neumann approach monotonically increases from

negative to positive at small Rr and increases to small negative values at large Rr (Fig.

4(b2)). As Rr increases, the EO component of Uy in the Dirichlet approach diminishes

to zero at ε = 0.2 and 0.8, but obtains peak values at ﬁrst and then decreases to zero at

ε = 0.4 and 0.6; while that in the Neumann approach decreases to constant values. Fig.

and (a3)/(b3), respectively.

5(b) shows that as Rr increases, the EO component of Uy changes from a same value at

Rr = 0.0, and approaches zero and a constant value in the Dirichlet and the Neumann

approaches, respectively. The diﬀerence between the EO components of Uy in the two

approaches increases signiﬁcantly as Rr increases.

The magnitude of the ICEO component of Uy is smaller than that of the EO component

of Uy in the Dirichlet approach. Thus, the net Uy follows a similar trend of its EO component

in the Dirichlet approach (Fig. 4(a3)). As ε increases, the net Uy increases from negative to

positive at small Rr and increases to small negative values at large Rr. As Rr increases, the

net Uy obtains peak values and eventually diminishes to zero. In the Neumann approach,

in contrast, the magnitude of the ICEO component of Uy is larger than that of the EO

component of Uy. The net Uy decreases to negative as Rr increases (Fig. 4(b3)). As ε

increases, the net Uy increases at small Rr but decreases at large Rr (Fig. 4(b3)). Signiﬁcant

diﬀerence is shown in Uy obtained in the two approaches at large Rr (Fig. 5).

The variation of the cylinder velocity Ω with Rr at diﬀerent ε is shown in Fig. 6. As ε

approach increases from zero and then decreases to zero with peak values (Fig. 6(a1)), while

that in the Neumann approach monotonically increases. The curve becomes steeper at larger

14

Rr (Fig. 6(b1)). The magnitude of the ICEO component of Ω (Figs. 6(a1) and 6(b1)) is

small compared to that of the EO component of Ω (Figs. 6(a2) and 6(b2)).

The magnitudes of the EO component of Ω in both approaches monotonically increase

as ε and Rr increase (Figs. 6(a2) and 6(b2)). However, as Rr increases, the curves in Fig.

6(a2) ﬂatten out, while those in Fig. 6 become steeper. As the EO component of Ω is larger

than the ICEO component of Ω in both approaches, the net Ω varies in the similar trend

as its the EO component (Figs. 6(a3) and 6(b3)). A larger ε leads to a greater Ω. As

Rr increases, the magnitude of Ω in the Dirichlet obtains peak values at moderate Rr when

ε = 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6, and monotonically increases when ε = 0.8 (Fig. 6(a3)). In the Neumann

approach, the magnitude of Ω presents a monotonic increase as Rr increases (Fig. 6(b3)).

In both approaches, the magnitudes of the ICEO and the EO components of Ω, and the net

Ω increase from Rr = 0.0 at same values (Fig. 7). As Rr increases, the curves in the two

approaches gradually deviate. The diﬀerences become signiﬁcantly large at large Rr (Fig.

7). Ω becomes very large when Rr is reaching 1.0, especially in the Neumann approach (Fig.

7). However, when Rr is close to 1.0, the distance between the cylinder and cylindrical pore

becomes very small, which may invalidate the thin EDL approximation. Such situation is

beyond the scope of the present model. When the cylindrical pore becomes inﬁnitely large

compared to the cylinder, i.e. Rr = 0 (τo = 0), the cylindrical pore behaves as a planar wall

with respect to the cylinder. The cylinder no longer rotates at Rr = 0.0. Ω also reaches zero

as ε decreases to zero. Hence, the cylinder only rotates when the cylindrical pore is ﬁnite

and they are eccentric to each other.

Maps of the cylinder velocity at θ0 = 0 are shown in Fig. 8. The vectors are for the

translational velocities of the cylinder, while the contours are for the rotational velocities.

For a nonzero θ0, the cylinder velocity map is the same as that at θ0 = 0 but tilts with

an angle corresponding to the value of θ0. To facilitate the following discussion, a polar

coordinate system is introduced as shown in the upper right corner of Fig. 8, where α

indicates the angle of the polar coordinates.

Fig. 8 shows that both the translational and rotational velocities of the cylinder in the

Neumann approach (Fig. 8(b)) are larger than those in the Dirichlet approach (Fig. 8(a)),

which is consistent with the previous discussion. The contour plot clearly demonstrates

that the cylinder possesses a greater rotational velocity Ω when it is near the cylindrical
pore at α = (2n − 1)π/4. When ˜ζ = 0, Ω obtains peak values of the same magnitude at

α = (2n − 1)π/4 near the cylindrical pore (Fig. 8(a1) and 8(b1)). When ˜ζ increases to 0.2,
the peak values at α = 5π/4 and 7π/4 are slightly enhanced while those at α = π/4 and
3π/4 are gently reduced (Fig. 8(a2) and 8(b2)). When ˜ζ is further increased to 1, the two

peak value zones at α = 5π/4 and 7π/4 are greatly enhanced, while those at α = π/4 and

3π/4 disappears in the Dirichlet approach (Fig. 8(a3)) and signiﬁcantly decreased in the

Neumann approach (Fig. 8(b3)). With a given electric ﬁeld, the magnitude and direction of

the cylinder rotational velocity can be tuned by adjusting the position of the cylinder within

the cylindrical pore.

The vector ﬁeld of the translational velocity U presents the magnitude distribution of

U and the cylinder trajectories when it is suspended in the cylindrical pore. Clearly, the
cylinder obtains large U when it is close to the cylindrical pore. When ˜ζ = 0, both the

Dirichlet and the Neumann approaches predict that the cylinder moves towards and becomes

stationary at the center of the cylindrical pore regardless of its initial position (Figs. 8(a1)
and 8(b1)). At ˜ζ = 0.2, the cylinder moves towards and rests at a stationary point near

the cylindrical pore due to the contribution of EO components of Ux and Uy (Figs. 8(a2)

and 8(b2)). The position of the stationary point in the Neumann approach (Fig. 8(b2)) is
closer to the cylindrical pore than that in the Dirichlet approach (Fig. 8(a2)). At ˜ζ = 1,

two stationary points appear in the cylindrical pore as the EO components of Ux and Uy are

greatly enhanced (Figs. 8(a3) and 8(b3)). Regardless of the initial position and the speciﬁc

trajectory, the cylinder eventually rests at either of the two stationary points in the Dirichlet

approach (Figs. 8(a3)). While in the Neumann approach, the cylinder may rest at one of the

two stationary points or reach the lower side of the cylindrical pore with a nonzero U (Figs.

8(b3)). The diﬀerent cylinder trajectories in Figs. 8(a3) and 8(b3) are resulted from the

diﬀerent EO components of Ux and Uy derived in the two approaches. The EO components

of Ux and Uy diminish to zero when Rr reaches 1.0 in the Dirichlet approach (Figs. 2(a3)

and 2(b3)), but approach constant values in the Neumann approach (Fig. 4(a2) and 2(b2)).

Therefore, the results derived in the Dirichlet approach are more reasonable.

B. Micromotor

The cylinder rotates when it is eccentric with respect to the cylindrical pore as shown

in Figs. 6 and S.3. Hence, a micromotor can be developed by letting the cylinder free to

rotate but not translate. The cylinder rotation may inﬂuence the establishment of the EDL

on the cylinder. To ensure the inﬂuence is negligible, the cylinder rotation has to be slow

compared to the EDL establishment. The characteristic time of the EDL formation is the

charging time tc, deﬁned as tc = κ−1Ri/Di, where κ−1 =pεwkBNAT /(2F 2c0) is the Debye

length of the EDL, where εw is the dielectric permittivity of the electrolyte solution; kB

is the Boltzmann constant; NA is the Avogadro constant; T is the absolute temperature

of the electrolyte solution; F is the Faraday constant; c0 is the molar concentration of the

electrolyte solution. We hereby deﬁne a parameter, the charging frequency fc = 1/tc,

fc =

where Γc = √2DiF/√εwkBNAT is a constant with the given parameters in Table I.

Eq. (36) shows that the charging frequency fc is proportional to √c0 and inversely
proportional to Ri. To ensure the eﬀect of the cylinder rotation on the EDL establishment

is insigniﬁcant, the cylinder rotational velocity Ω should be much smaller than the charging
frequency fc, Ω ≪ fc. As the dimensionless rotational velocity of the cylinder is always
smaller than one as shown in Figs. 6 and S.3, the rotational velocity scale Ωi is used to

represent cylinder rotation in the following analysis on the inﬂuence of cylinder rotation on

the EDL formation.

18

The rotational velocity scale is,

Ωi = Ui/Ri =

εwE 2

µ

= ΓrE 2
0,

(37)

where Γr = εw/µ is a constant with the given parameters in Table I. It is easy to conclude

that Ωi is a quadratic function of E0 and free of Ri.

When c0 = 1 × 10−3 mol·L−1, κ−1 ≈ 10 nm. We take the cylinder radius Ri =10 µm,
thus, κRi ≈ 1000, the thin EDL approximation holds. The charging frequency of the EDL
establishment fc ≈ 10000 s−1, which is much larger than the rotational velocity of most
micromotors.

A schematic diagram of the micromotor and the variation of the rotational velocity scale

of the cylinder Ωi with the applied electric ﬁeld strength E0 are presented in Fig. 9. The

rotational velocity scale increases rapidly as E0 increases.

The rotational velocity of the load-free micromotor is the same as that shown in Figs. 6,

Me + MH + Md = Ml.

FIG. 10. Variation of the rotational velocity of the micromotor with the load Ml in (a) the Dirichlet

approach and (b) the Neumann approach. Here the radius ratio Rr = 0.5, the eccentricity ε = 0.5,

the electric ﬁeld phase angle θ0 = 7π/4, the dimensionless zeta potential of the cylindrical pore
˜ζ = 0, the cylinder radius Ri = 10 µm, and the electric ﬁeld strength E0 = 10 kV·m−1.

The variation of the rotational velocity of the micromotor Ωm with the load Ml

is

presented in Fig. 10. Clearly, Ωm reduces linearly as Ml increases and reaches zero when

Ml equals to the hydrodynamic moment MH . The ranges of Ml and Ωm in the Neumann

approach is much larger than that in the Dirichlet approach. By choosing appropriate

parameters according to Figs. 6, S.3 and 9(b), a micromotor can be developed with a

controllable rotational velocity. MH increases as the radius ratio Rr and the eccentricity ε

increase (Eqs. (29) and (S.66)). Thus, the upper limit of the load Ml can be increased by

increasing Rr and ε. Accordingly, a micromotor with a much faster rotational velocity Ωm

and a larger bearing capacity, i.e. a larger load Ml, can be developed. The micromotor can

also bear loads in the opposite direction by adjusting the electric ﬁeld phase angle θ0.

Both the Dirichlet and the Neumann boundary conditions of the electric ﬁeld have

been widely used in the studies of particle suspensions [55–57]. As discussed, our results

20

show that the cylinder velocities obtained using the Dirichlet approach (Eq. (6)) are more

reasonable than those obtained using the Neumann approach (Eq. (7)). It is shown that

the translational velocities of the cylinder, Ux and Uy, diminish to zero at the touching limit

(Rr = 1.0) using the Dirichlet approach (Figs. 2(a) and 4(a)), but reaches constant values

using the Neumann approach (Figs. 2(b) and 4(b)). The cylinder trajectories shown in Fig.

8 also reveal that the Dirichlet approach oﬀers a better prediction. The comparison with

the statistical mechanics modelling also favors the Dirichlet approach [58]. Eq. (7) could not

provide a prediction as good as Eq. (6) is probably because it does not deﬁne the tangential

component of the electric ﬁeld gradient on the cylindrical pore.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this paper, the induced charge electrophoresis of a conducting cylinder suspended in

a non-conducting cylindrical pore is theoretically studied, and a micromotor is proposed

utilizing the cylinder rotation. Both the Dirichlet and the Neumann boundary conditions

of the electric ﬁeld are applied on the cylindrical pore. The analytical study on the cylinder

velocities shows that the cylinder not only translates but also rotates when the cylinder and

the cylindrical pore are eccentric. The cylinder velocities are examined with various values

of the eccentricity, the radius ratio, the electric ﬁeld phase angle, and the zeta potential

of the cylindrical pore. The analysis shows that the cylinder velocities obtained in the

two approaches present great diﬀerences. Moreover, the cylinder trajectories show that

the cylinder always approaches and rests at certain stationary points within the cylindrical

pore. The Dirichlet approach predicts more reasonable cylinder behaviors than the Neumann

approach.

By choosing appropriate parameters of the electrokinetic system, the micromotor

proposed in this paper can achieve a high rotational velocity without inﬂuencing the EDL

establishment on the cylinder. A large eccentricity and a strong electric ﬁeld are preferred

to develop a micromotor with a high rotational velocity and a great bearing capacity. The

micromotor proposed here has advantages of simple geometry and low operating voltage, and

a great potential in the application of the lab-on-a-chip systems for chemical and biological

analysis.
