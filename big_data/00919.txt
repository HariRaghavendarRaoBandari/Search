Abstract Recent results of meson photo-production at the existing electron machines with polarized
real photon beams and the measurement of polarization observables of the ﬁnal state baryons have
provided high precision data that led to the discovery of new excited nucleon and ∆ states using
multi-channel partial wave analyses procedures. The internal structure of several prominent excited
states has been revealed employing meson electroproduction processes. On the theoretical front, lattice
QCD is now predicting the baryon spectrum with very similar characteristics as the constituent quark
model, and continuum QCD, such as is represented in the Dyson-Schwinger Equations approach and in
light front relativistic quark models, describes the non-perturbative behavior of resonance excitations
at photon virtuality of Q2 > 1.5GeV 2. In this talk I discuss the need to continue a vigorous program
of nucleon spectroscopy and the study of the internal structure of excited states as a way to reveal the
eﬀective degrees of freedom underlying the excited states and their dependence on the distance scale
probed.

1 Introduction

The excited states of the nucleon have been studied experimentally since the 1950’s [1]. They con-
tributed to the discovery of the quark model in 1964 by Gell-Mann and Zweig [2; 3], and were critical
for the discovery of ”color” degrees of freedom as introduced by Greenberg [4]. The quark structure of
baryons resulted in the prediction of a wealth of excited states with underlying spin-ﬂavor and orbital
symmetry of SU (6) ⊗ O(3), and led to a broad experimental eﬀort to search for these states. Most
of the initially observed states were found with hadronic probes. However, of the many excited states
predicted in the quark model, only a fraction have been observed to date. Search for the ”missing”
states and detailed studies of the resonance structure are now mostly carried out using electromagnetic
probes and have been a major focus of hadron physics for the past decade [5]. A broad experimental
eﬀort is currently underway with measurements of exclusive meson photoproduction and electropro-
duction reactions, including many polarization observables. Precision data and the development of
multi-channel partial wave analysis procedures have resulted in the discovery of several new excited
states of the nucleon, which have been entered in the Review of Particle Physics [6].

A quantitative description of baryon spectroscopy and the structure of excited nucleons must even-
tually involve solving QCD for a complex strongly interacting multi-particle system. Recent advances

in Lattice QCD led to predictions of the nucleon spectrum in QCD with dynamical quarks [7], albeit
with still large pion masses of 396 MeV. Lattice prediction can therefore only be taken as indicative of
the quantum numbers of excited states and not of the masses of speciﬁc states. In parallel, the develop-
ment of dynamical coupled channel models is being pursued with new vigor. The EBAC group at JLab
has shown [8] that dynamical eﬀects can result in signiﬁcant mass shifts of the excited states. As a
particularly striking result, a very large shift was found for the Roper resonance pole mass to 1365 MeV
downward from its bare core mass of 1736 MeV. This result has clariﬁed the longstanding puzzle of
the incorrect mass ordering of N (1440) 1
resonances in the constituent quark model.

Developments on the phenomenological side go hand in hand with a world-wide experimental eﬀort to
produce high precision data in many diﬀerent channel as a basis for a determination of the light-quark
baryon resonance spectrum. On the example of experimental results from CLAS, the strong impact of
precise meson photoproduction data is discussed. Several reviews have recently been published on this
and related subjects [9; 10; 11; 12; 13].

It is interesting to point out recent ﬁndings that relate the observed baryon spectrum of diﬀerent
quark ﬂavors with the baryon densities in the freeze out temperature in heavy ion collisions, which
show evidence for missing baryons in the strangeness and the charm baryon sector [14; 15]. These data
hint that an improved baryon model including further unobserved light quark baryons may resolve
the current discrepancy between lattice QCD results and the results obtained using a baryon model
that includes only states listed by the PDG. A complete accounting of excited baryon states of all
ﬂavors seems essential for a quantitative description of the occurrence of baryons in the evolution of
the microsecond old universe.

Accounting for the complete excitation spectrum of the nucleon (protons and neutrons) and un-
derstanding the eﬀective degrees of freedom is perhaps the most important and certainly the most
challenging task of hadron physics. The experimental N* program currently focusses on the search
for new excited states in the mass range from 2 GeV to 2.5 GeV using energy-tagged photon beams
in the few GeV range, and the study of the internal structure of prominent resonances in meson
electroproduction.

2 Establishing the N* Spectrum

The complex structure of the light-quark (u & d quarks) baryon excitation spectrum complicates the
experimental search for individual states. As a result of the strong interaction, resonances are wide,
often 200 MeV to 400 MeV, and are diﬃcult to uniquely identify when only diﬀerential cross sections
are measured. Most of the excited nucleon states listed in the Review of Particle Properties prior to 2012
have been observed in elastic pion scattering πN → πN . However there are important limitations in the
sensitivity to the higher mass nucleon states that may have small ΓπN decay widths. The extraction of
resonance contributions then becomes exceedingly diﬃcult in πN scattering. Estimates for alternative
decay channels have been made in quark model calculations[16] for various channels. This has led to
a major experimental eﬀort at Jeﬀerson Lab, ELSA, GRAAL, and MAMI to chart diﬀerential cross
sections and polarization observables for a variety of meson photoproduction channels. At JLab with
CLAS, several ﬁnal states have been measured with high precision[17; 18; 19; 20; 21; 22; 23; 24; 25; 26]
that are now employed in multi-channel analyses.

2.1 New states from open strangeness photoproduction
Here one focus has recently been on measurements of γp → K +Λ, using a polarized photon beam several
polarization observables can be measured by analyzing the parity violating decay of the recoil Λ → pπ−.
It is well known that the energy-dependence of a partial-wave amplitude for one particular channel
is inﬂuenced by other reaction channels due to unitarity constraints. To fully describe the energy-
dependence of an amplitude one has to include other reaction channels in a coupled-channel approach.
Such analyses have been developed by the Bonn-Gatchina group[27], at JLab[28], at J¨ulich[29] and
other groups.

The data sets with the highest impact on resonance amplitudes in the mass range above 1.7 GeV
have been kaon-hyperon production using a spin-polarized photon beam and where the polarization of

blue full circles are based on the topology K +pπ−, the red open triangles are based on topology K +p or

structure near threshold.

the Λ or Σ◦ is also measured. The high precision cross section and polarization data [22; 23; 24; 25; 26]
provide nearly full polar angle coverage and span the K +Λ invariant mass range from threshold to 2.9
GeV, hence covering the full nucleon resonance domain where new states might be discovered.

The backward angle K +Λ data in Fig.1 show clear resonance-like structures at 1.7 GeV and 1.9
GeV that are particularly prominent and well-separated from other structures at backward angles,
while at more forward angles (not shown) t-channel processes become prominent and dominate the
cross section. The broad enhancement at 2.2 GeV may also indicate resonant behavior although it

is less visible at more central angles with larger background contributions. The K +Σ channel also
indicates signiﬁcant resonant behavior as seen in Fig. 2. The peak structure at 1.9 GeV is present

can determine the underlying resonances, their masses and spin-parity. The task is somewhat easier
for the KΛ channel, as the iso-scalar nature of the Λ selects isospin- 1
2 states to contribute to the KΛ
ﬁnal state, while both isospin- 1

2 states can contribute to the KΣ ﬁnal state.

These cross section data together with the Λ and Σ recoil polarization and polarization transfer
data to the Λ and Σ had strong impact on the discovery of several new nucleon states. They also
provided new evidence for several candidate states that had been observed previously but lacked
conﬁrmation as shown in Fig. 3. It is interesting to observe that ﬁve of the observed nucleon states
have nearly degenerate masses near 1.9 GeV. Similarly, the new ∆ state appears to complete a mass
degenerate multiplet near 1.9 GeV as well. There is no obvious mechanism for this apparent degeneracy.
Nonetheless, all new states may be accommodated within the symmetric constituent quark model based
on SU (6)⊗ O(3) symmetry group as far as quantum numbers are concerned. As discussed in section 1
for the case of the Roper resonance N (1440) 1
, the masses of all pure quark model states need to be

corrected for dynamical coupled channel eﬀects to compare them with observed resonances. The same
applies to the recent Lattice QCD predictions [30] for the nucleon and Delta spectrum.

2.2 Vectormeson photoproduction

In the mass range above 2.0 GeV resonances tend to decouple from simple ﬁnal states like N π, N η,
and KΛ. We have to consider more complex ﬁnal states with multi-mesons or vector mesons, such
as N ω, N φ, and K∗Σ. The study of such ﬁnal states adds signiﬁcant complexity as more amplitudes
can contribute to spin-1 mesons photoproduction compared to pseudo-scalar meson production. As is
the case for N η production, the N ω channel is selective to isospin 1
2 nucleon states only. CLAS has
collected a tremendous amount of data in the pω [20; 21] and pφ [31; 32] ﬁnal states on diﬀerential cross
sections and spin-density matrix elements that are now entering into the more complex multi-channel
analyses such as Bonn-Gatchina [33]. The CLAS collaboration performed a single channel event-based
analysis, whose results are shown in Fig. 4, and provide further evidence for the N (2000) 5
2

Photoproduction of φ mesons is also considered a potentially rich source of new excited nucleon
states in the mass range above 2 GeV. Some lower mass states such as N (1535) 1
may have signiﬁcant
2
s¯s components [34]. Such components may result in states coupling to pφ with signiﬁcant strength above
threshold. Diﬀerential cross sections and spin-density matrix elements have been measured for γp → pφ
in a mass range up to nearly 3 GeV. In Fig. 5 structures are seen near 2.2 GeV in the forward most
angle bins and at very backward angles for both decay channels φ → K +K− and φ → K 0
s , and with
the exception of the smallest forward angle bin the structures are more prominent at backward angles.
Only a multi-channel partial wave analysis will be able to pull out any signiﬁcant resonance strength.
Fig. 6 shows the diﬀerential cross section dσ/dt of the most forward angle bin. A broad structure
at 2.2 GeV is present, but does not show the typical Breit-Wigner behavior of a single resonance.
It also does not ﬁt the data in a larger angle range, which indicates that contributions other than
genuine resonances may be signiﬁcant. The forward and backward angle structures may also hint at
the presence of dynamical eﬀects possibly due to molecular contributions such as diquark-anti-triquark
contributions [35], the strangeness equivalent to the recently observed hidden charm P +

Another process that has promise in the search for new excited baryon states, including those with

3 Structure of excited nucleons

Meson photoproduction has become an essential tool in the search for new excited baryons. The
exploration of the internal structure of excited states and the eﬀective degrees of freedom contributing
to s-channel resonance excitation requires use of electron beams where the virtuality (Q2) of the

exchanged photon can be varied to probe the spatial structure (Fig. 7). Electroproduction of ﬁnal
states with pseudoscalar mesons (e.g. N π, pη, KΛ) have been employed with CLAS, leading to new
insights into the scale dependence of eﬀective degrees of freedom, e.g. meson-baryon, constituent quark,
and dressed quark contributions. Several excited states, shown in Fig. 7 assigned to their primary
SU (6) ⊗ O(3) supermultiplets have been studied. The N ∆(1232) 3
transition is now well measured
in a large range of Q2 [36; 37; 38; 40]. Two of the prominent higher mass states, the Roper resonance
N (1440) 1
are shown in Fig. 8 as representative examples [39; 40] from a wide program
2
at JLab [41; 42; 43; 44; 45; 46]. For these two states advanced relativistic quark model calculations [47]
and QCD calculations from Dyson-Schwinger Equation [48] and Light Cone sum rule [49] have recently
become available, for the ﬁrst time employing QCD-based modeling of the excitation of the quark core.
There is agreement with the data at Q2 > 1.5 GeV2. The calculations deviate signiﬁcantly from the
data at lower Q2, which indicates signiﬁcant non quark core eﬀects. For the Roper resonance such
contributions have been described successfully in dynamical meson-baryon models [50] and in eﬀective
ﬁeld theory [51].

Knowledge of the helicity amplitudes in a large Q2 allows for the determination of the transition
charge densities on the light cone in transverse impact parameter space (bx, by) [52]. Figure 9 shows

. There are clear diﬀerences in the charge transition

cloud than N (1535) and develops a larger shift in by when the proton is polarized along the bx axis.

4 Conclusions and Outlook

Over the past ﬁve years eight baryon states in the mass range from 1.85 to 2.15 GeV have been either
discovered or evidence for the existence of states has been signiﬁcantly strengthened. To a large degree
this is the result of adding very precise photoproduction data in open strangeness channels to the data
base that is included in multi-channel partial wave analyses, especially the Bonn-Gatchina PWA. The
possibility to measure polarization observables in these processes has been critical [53]. In the mass
range above 2 GeV more complex processes such as vector mesons or ∆π may have sensitivity to states
with higher masses but require more complex analyses techniques to be brought to bear. Precision data
in such channels have been available for a few years but remain to be fully incorporated in multi-channel
partial wave analyses processes. The light-quark baryon spectrum is likely also populated with hybrid

excitations [7] where the gluonic admixtures to the wave function are dominating the excitation. These
states appear with the same quantum numbers as ordinary quark excitations, and can only be isolated
from ordinary states due to the Q2 dependence of their helicity amplitudes [54], which is expected to
be quite diﬀerent from ordinary quark excitations. This requires new electroproduction data especially
at low Q2 [55] with diﬀerent ﬁnal states and at masses above 2 GeV.

Despite the very signiﬁcant progress made in recent years to further establish the light-quark
baryon spectrum and explore the internal structure of excited states, much remains to be done. A
vast amount of precision data already collected needs to be included in the multi-channel analysis
frameworks, and polarization data are still to be analyzed [53]. There are approved proposals to study
resonance excitations at much higher Q2 and with higher precision at Jeﬀerson Lab with CLAS12 [56]
that may reveal the transition to the bare quark core contributions at short distances.
