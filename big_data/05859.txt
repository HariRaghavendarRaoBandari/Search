Abstract

There is a commonality among contagious diseases, tweets, urban crimes, nuclear reactions, and

neuronal ﬁrings that past events facilitate the future occurrence of events. The spread of events has

been extensively studied such that the systems exhibit catastrophic chain reactions if the interaction

represented by the ratio of reproduction exceeds unity; however, their subthreshold states for the

case of the weaker interaction are not fully understood. Here, we report that these systems are

possessed by nonstationary cascades of event-occurrences already in the subthreshold regime. Event

cascades can be harmful in some contexts, when the peak-demand causes vaccine shortages, heavy

traﬃc on communication lines, frequent crimes, or large ﬂuctuations in nuclear reactions, but may

be beneﬁcial in other contexts, such that spontaneous activity in neural networks may be used to

generate motion or store memory. Thus it is important to comprehend the mechanism by which

such cascades appear, and consider controlling a system to tame or facilitate ﬂuctuations in the

event-occurrences. The critical interaction for the emergence of cascades depends greatly on the

network structure in which individuals are connected. We demonstrate that we can predict whether

cascades may emerge in a network, given information about the interactions between individuals.

Furthermore, we develop a method of reallocating connections among individuals so that event

cascades may be either impeded or impelled in a network.

INTRODUCTION

Our life is full of cause-and-eﬀect relationships, such that past events inﬂuence the future

occurrence of events. The proliferation process has been studied using both macroscopic

models, such as the epidemic model [1], and microscopic models, such as the self-exciting

point process proposed by Hawkes [2, 3]. These models have been applied to analyze not

only the communication of diseases [4–8] but also urban crime [9], human activity [10–

14], economics [15], genome sequences [16], and neuronal ﬁring [17, 18]. A key quantity

representing the interaction in these various phenomena is the basic reproduction ratio,

which is deﬁned as the average number of additional events induced by a single event [19].

In epidemics, a disease becomes a pandemic in a homogeneous network if the reproduction

ratio is greater than unity, as in a nuclear chain reaction [20–22], and vanishes otherwise.

Nevertheless, the event-occurrence does not cease if individuals are stimulated in external

communities or exhibit spontaneous activity. In such situations, the system may still exhibit

cascades of event-occurrences intermittently, even if the reproduction ratio is smaller than

the epidemic threshold, as in tweets [11, 23, 24] and neuronal ﬁrings in vivo [25]. The non-

stationary ﬂuctuations may be terminated by reducing the reproduction ratio further [26].

Event cascades can be a nuisance in some contexts, such as when the peak-demand causes

vaccine shortages [27, 28] or heavy traﬃc on communication lines [29], but may be beneﬁcial

in other contexts; for example, spontaneous activity in neural networks may be used to gen-

erate motion or store memory [30–32]. Thus, it is important to comprehend the mechanism

by which such cascades appear. We show that such a transition between stationary and

nonstationary states generally occurs in every proliferation system, obtain the condition

on which cascades may emerge in a given network, and suggest a systematic method for

controlling systems to oppress or promote the event-occurrence bursts.

II. MEAN RATE OF EVENT-OCCURRENCE

Although the epidemic model and the Hawkes process appear to diﬀer from one another,

they have something in common because both were constructed to describe the proliferation

processes. To identify their common features, we ﬁrst revise them by considering realistic

constraints.

cess. (a) The equilibrium fraction of infected individuals i∞ obtained by the susceptible-infected-

susceptible (SIS) model revised by considering spontaneous activity ρ > 0.

(b) The mean oc-

currence rate hλi of the Hawkes process revised by introducing the refractory period 1/γ > 0.
These models give identical equilibria, hλi = γi∞, for the same spontaneous activation ρ and the
refractory period 1/γ (magenta lines in (a) and (b)).

A. Revising the epidemic model

For an epidemic model, we consider the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model de-

scribing the situation in which infected individuals may recover without immunity:

di/dt = βsi − γi,

(1)

where i and s are the fractions of infected and susceptible individuals, respectively (i+s = 1);

β is the rate at which susceptible individuals are infected by contacting infected individuals;

and γ is the rate at which infected individuals recover and regain susceptibility. The infected

individuals asymptotically vanish if the reproduction ratio R0 = β/γ is smaller than or equal
to unity; otherwise, the fraction is ﬁnite: i∞ ≡ limt→∞ i(t) = 1− 1/R0. To consider extrinsic
or spontaneous activation, we suggest revising the SIS model by adding an inﬂow to the

infected population from the susceptible one:

di/dt = βsi − γi + ρs.

(2)

In the presence of spontaneous activity ρ(> 0), the asymptotic fraction of infected indi-

viduals remains positive and smoothly increases with R0, and, accordingly, the epidemic

transition at R0 = 1 is softened (Fig. 1(a)).

3

B. Revising the Hawkes process

The Hawkes process considers spontaneous occurrences in terms of the positive base rate

ρ and describes the manner in which the event-occurrence rate λ(t) is modulated by past

events:

where tk is the occurrence time of the kth event. The history kernel h(t) satisﬁes the

λ(t) = ρ + R0Xk

h(t − tk),

(3)

causality, h(t) = 0 for t < 0, and the normalization, R ∞
0 h(t)dt = 1. By taking the ensemble
average, the average rate of event-occurrence is obtained as hλ(t)i = ρ/(1 − R0). The
divergence at R0 = 1 arises from instantaneous reactivation, which is an artifact caused by

the simplicity of the linear model, which ignores the refractory period during which each

individual does not recover susceptibility. Here, we suggest revising the model by introducing

the eﬀect of a refractory period 1/γ:

λ(t) =(cid:18)1 −

λ(t)

γ (cid:19) ρ + R0Xk

h(t − tk)! .

(4)

By taking an ensemble average and approximating hλ2i with hλi2, we obtain the average
rate of event-occurrences as hλi = γi∞, where i∞ is the asymptotic fraction obtained for
the revised SIS model (Fig. 1(b)). Thus, the epidemic model and the Hawkes process may

represent the identical mean occurrence rate by taking the spontaneous activation and the

refractory periods into account.

III. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE EVENT-OCCURRENCE

Although the systems no longer exhibit a clear transition at R0 = 1 causing the catas-

trophic chain reaction, they may still show nonstationary ﬂuctuations with intermittent

cascades of event-occurrences at lower reproduction ratios; when the reproduction ratio is

even smaller, they may remain stationary, producing apparently random events over time.

A. Epidemic Markov process

The SIS model that addresses the mean population dynamics cannot represent ﬂuc-

tuations in the event-occurrences. Here, we construct and simulate a Markov process of

microscopic dynamics in which individuals become infected and recover to be susceptible

(Fig. 2(a)). In every interval of a small time-step δt, each susceptible individual in total
population N may become infected with a probability (βi+ρ)δt, which shifts as i → i+1/N.
Each infected individual may regain their susceptibility with the probability γδt, which shifts
as i → i − 1/N. Figure 2(b) depicts sample sequences of infected times: At a reproduction
ratio of R0 = β/γ = 0.2, the occurrence of infection appears random across individuals

but stationary in the whole system. By contrast, at R0 = 0.6 or 0.8, the event sequence

appears nonstationary, exhibiting spontaneous cascades of occurrences. Indeed, microscopic

ﬂuctuation is ampliﬁed to be macroscopically visible, whereas the average rate is restrained

to be ﬁnite.

5

B. Deﬁning the stationarity of a given sequence

We suggest deciding whether a given series of events is stationary or nonstationary based

on whether proper rate estimators conclude a constant rate or a ﬂuctuating rate, respectively.

Here, we adopt a method of selecting the histogram bin size to minimize the expected mean

square error between the histogram and the unknown underlying rate [33]. Note that the de-

cision regarding stationary vs nonstationary state is common across proper rate estimators,

such as the Empirical Bayes and variational Bayes Hidden Markov estimators [34].

Histograms were ﬁtted to the data: The optimal bin size ∆∗ was diverging (becoming as

large as the entire observation period) when R0 = 0.2, whereas it was ﬁnite (signiﬁcantly

smaller than the entire period) when R0 = 0.6 and 0.8. Figure 2(c) depicts the manner

in which the inverse bin size 1/∆∗ varies with the reproduction ratio R0. 1/∆∗ remains

near zero if R0 is smaller than approximately 0.3, and it departs from zero otherwise, thus

exhibiting the stationary-nonstationary (SN) transition.

C. Revised Hawkes process

We also simulated the revised Hawkes process (4) with parameters identical to those

used for the epidemic Markov process. Here, events are indicated by repeating the Bernoulli

trials with a probability of λ(t)δt in every small interval of δt. By plotting 1/∆∗ versus R0,

we can also observe the transition (Fig. 2(c)). Figure 2(d) depicts the critical reproduction

ratios obtained for the epidemic Markov process and the revised Hawkes process plotted

against the refractory period 1/γ, indicating that the SN critical points for both models

are robustly close to 1 − 1/√2 ≈ 0.3, which was obtained for the original (linear) Hawkes

process (1/γ = 0) in our previous study [26]. Note that the critical point is independent of

the shape of the kernel, as well as the base rate.

IV. EVENT-OCCURRENCES IN INHOMOGENEOUS NETWORKS

Finally, we consider the emergence of cascades in a population of individuals interacting

through inhomogeneous connections.

by the inﬂuence of events generated at other nodes, and events are derived from the underlying

A. Multivariate Hawkes process

To obtain the condition for the SN transition analytically, we analyze the linear multi-

variate Hawkes processes (Fig. 3(a)). The rate of event-occurrences in the ith individual or
node (i = 1, 2,· · · , N) is given as

λi(t) = ρi +

Xj=1

h(t − tk

(5)

where ρi represents the base rate, tk
j

is the occurrence time of the kth event in the jth

node, and αij represents the interaction from the jth node to the ith node. Because of the
interactions between individuals, A ≡ {αij}, the average rates hλi = {hλii} are shifted from
the base rates ρ = {ρi} as hλi = Lρ, where L is the Leontief inverse [35]: L ≡P∞
n=0 An =
I/ (I − A).

B. Controlling the event-occurrence cascades

Even when the ﬂuctuations are not detectable at any single node, all events occurring

in the entire set of nodes may exhibit visible ﬂuctuations because the signal-to-noise ratio

may increase when multiple series of events are superposed (Fig. 3(b)). By analyzing equa-

7

tion Eq. (5), we obtain the condition required for a series of events occurring in an entire

population to be nonstationary (see Appendix A):

C ≡ Pi,j(cid:0)LΛLT(cid:1)ij

Pihλii

> 2,

(6)

where Λ ≡ diag (hλi).

Here, we consider 0-1 connectivity with strength αij = 0 or R0/Nc, where c is the fraction

of connections. For a fully connected network c = 1, the summed rate λ(t) = PN
obeys the original Hawkes process Eq. (3) with ρ =PN

i=1 λi(t)
i=1 ρi. For the Erd˝os-R´enyi network,
in which a pair of nodes is independently randomly linked at a fraction of c, the SN critical

point remains near 0.3 for a wide range of c.

Nevertheless, it is possible to shift C by reallocating the connections between individuals;

exchanging connections αij and αi′j ′ may alter C by

αijHij − αi′j ′Hi′j ′

∆C = −

+ O(R0/N)2,

(7)

Pkhλki

where Hij ≡(cid:0)(Pk Lki)2 − C(cid:1) ρj +2 (Pk Lkj)hλji. To raise or lower C, we repeat exchanging

a pair of connections that maximizes or minimizes ∆C (Fig. 4(a)).

A network of (R0, c) may change the state from stationary to nonstationary if C steps

across the critical value of 2 from below or vice versa by reconnecting individuals. Figure 4(b)

demonstrates the manner in which C is altered by the steepest ascent or descent based on

Eq. (7). When (R0, c) = (0.1, 0.1), C remains below 2, even when all connections are

reallocated; however, when (R0, c) = (0.35, 0.1), C exceeds 2, indicating that the system
may change between nonstationary (C > 2) and stationary (C ≤ 2).

C. Network structures favorable for inciting or impeding cascades

In the study of epidemics, whether the epidemic threshold is higher in the clustered

networks [8, 36, 37] or not

[38] has been controversial. Here, we are not addressing the

epidemic transition, but we are interested in how the clustering of individuals inﬂuences the

S-N transition. Figure 4(c) depicts the manner in which the average clustering coeﬃcient

changes with our gradient ascent or descent of C, indicating that clustering tends to fa-

cilitate the event-occurrence cascades. A similar tendency was reported in neural network

simulations [32]. An advantage of our method is that we can control the cascade bursting

activity by systematically rearranging connections based on a single measure: C.

Figure 4(d) depicts the range of (R0, c) in which a network may exhibit stationary and

nonstationary states. In the “Stationary” regime, the systems never generate visible cas-

cades, even when connections are reallocated, whereas in the “Nonstationary” regime, the

systems always exhibit cascades. In the “S-N 0” regime, networks may be either stationary

9

or nonstationary, depending on the manner in which individuals are connected. In the “S-N

1” regime, networks may be either stationary or nonstationary if the reciprocal connections

can be controlled independently, whereas undirected networks, whose connections are recip-
rocally symmetric {αij = αji}, remain nonstationary, always generating cascades of events.
For undirected networks, the critical point R0 appears to be bounded at approximately 0.3.

As extreme conﬁgurations with low critical points in R0, we considered networks of (i):

the nodes of one group are fully connected within the group, and the others are isolated; and

(ii): the nodes of one group are fully connected within the group and also receive undirected

(reciprocal) connections from all nodes of another group. The critical points of R0 exhibit

crossover at c = 0.20, and above and below this point, those of (i) and (ii) are lower. The

criticality in low R0 implies that these conﬁgurations tend to facilitate cascade bursting.

As an opposite extreme, we considered another conﬁguration (iii): each node of one group

receives only directed connections from another group. We also considered a speciﬁc hierar-

chical networks of (iv): every node exerts the inﬂuence over the lower hierarchy nodes in a

manner that connections form a triangular matrix. All critical points for these speciﬁc cases

are obtained analytically (see Appendix B) and plotted in Fig. 4(d): The conﬁgurations (i)

and (ii) tend to incite bursting, whereas the conﬁgurations (iii) and (iv) impede bursting.

These observations imply that networks in which small number of individuals occupy recip-

rocal connections favor event cascade bursting, whereas directed unilateral connections tend

to impede cascades.

Finally we demonstrate the manner in which the network is reconnected by our method

for inciting or impeding cascades (Fig. 5); we take up the network of “Zachary’s Karate

Club” [39] and reallocate the (undirected) friendships between 34 people. By assuming that

the original network is at the criticality C = 2, we reorganized the network so that their

entire communications becomes stationary or nonstationary. The operation to impede the

communication cascades (∆C < 0) tended to make all people be connected harmoniously.

Contrariwise, the operation to incite the cascade (∆C > 0) made the society polarized into

two kinds of people; a few people have exclusive rich connections, while others are connected

only with those people.

V. DISCUSSION

Here, we showed that the proliferation process may exhibit the SN transition at which

nonstationary cascades of event-occurrences emerge from the stationary process. The crit-

ical reproduction ratio for the SN transition is much smaller than the threshold for the

conventional epidemic transition exhibiting chain reactions. The SN transition may depend

greatly on the manner in which individuals are connected. We developed a theory for pre-

dicting the occurrence of cascades in a network. We also suggested a method of reconnecting

individuals for impeding or inciting cascade bursting in a network. To set about applying

our theory to real-world problems, we need information regarding interactions. It may be

the next challenge to analyze subthreshold dynamics occurring in a variety of proliferation

processes and develop methods of estimating interactions between nodes or individuals from

their sequences of events.

Appendix A: Derivation of the condition for the SN transition

Here, we derive the condition for the SN transition for a given series of events. It has

been proven that the optimal bin size may be ﬁnite if ﬂuctuation in the underlying rate
δλ(t) ≡ λ(t) − hλi satisﬁes the condition [34, 40]

1

hλiZ ∞

−∞hδλ(t + s)δλ(t)ids > 1,

(A1)

and diverges otherwise. This is derived as follows. The mean square error between the
underlying rate λ(t) and the histogram ˆλ(t) is given as

S = lim
T →∞

1

T Z T
0 (cid:28)(cid:16)λ(t) − ˆλ(t)(cid:17)2(cid:29) dt,

(A2)

where T is the entire observation interval, and the bracket represents the ensemble average

over the possible realization of the stochastic process. In each bin of size ∆, the histogram
ˆλ(t) is a constant whose height is the number of events K divided by the bin size ∆. Thus,

the mean square error is transformed as

The expected number of events in each interval is given by integrating the underlying rate:

0 λ(t)dt. Because events are independently drawn, the Poisson relation holds:

hKi = R ∆
hK 2i = hKi2 + hKi. Inserting these relations into Eq. (A3), we have

square error may have a minimum at some ﬁnite ∆. Based on the second-order transition

12

in which the minimum position ∆∗ goes to inﬁnity or 1/∆∗ goes to zero continuously, the

condition for the transition is given as

< 0.

(A5)

This can be summed up as a condition of the rate ﬂuctuation given in inequality (A1) if

R ∞

0 sφ(s)ds is ﬁnite. This condition was derived from the optimization of a histogram and
was found to be identical to that derived from the marginal likelihood maximization of the

Bayesian rate estimator, implying that this condition may be a universal bound for detecting

rate ﬂuctuation [41].

For the linear self-exciting point process, the power spectrum of the rate ﬂuctuation or
the Fourier transformation of the autocorrelation φ(s) ≡ hδλ(t + s)δλ(t)i was obtained by
Hawkes [2]. The result can be summarized as [26]

˜φω =(cid:18)

1

(1 − R0˜hω)(1 − R0˜h−ω) − 1(cid:19)hλi,

(A6)

where ˜hω is the Fourier transform of the kernel function h(t). Because ˜φ0 = R ∞
−∞ φ(s)ds =
R ∞
−∞hδλ(t + s)δλ(t)ids, the condition for the linear self-exciting process to be nonstationary
is obtained as 1/(1−R0)2 > 2. Thus, the SN transition occurs at R0 = 1−1/√2 independent

of the time course of supplementary probability h(t) and the base rate ρ.

The multivariate Hawkes process (5) is also analytically tractable;

in particular, the
Fourier zero-mode of the correlations φ(s) ≡ {φij(s)} ≡ {hδλi(t + s)δλj(t)i} is obtained
as [3, 26],

˜φ0 = LΛLT − Λ.

(A7)

Each node may exhibit the SN criticality if the correlation of each individual, φii(s), satisﬁes

the SN condition. Even when rate ﬂuctuations are not detectable at any single node, the

summed activity of multiple nodes may exhibit ﬂuctuation. The condition for the superposed

series to exhibit the SN transition is obtained by applying the nonstationary condition (A1)

to the summed rate λ(t) =PN

i=1 λi(t), thus leading to inequality (6).
