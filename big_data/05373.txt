Introduction

After years of eﬀorts made by researchers, the study of sharp convex bounds on the

sum of random variables (also known as aggregate sums) with given marginal distribu-

tions but unknown dependence structure has been achieved a lot of signiﬁcant results.

Mathematically, given an arbitrary Fr´echet space R(F1, · · · , Fn) of all random vectors
having F1, · · · , Fn as marginal distributions, to ﬁnd two random vectors (X m
1 , · · · , X m
n )
and (X M

n ) belonging to R(F1, · · · , Fn) such that

1 , · · · , X M

for any (X1, · · · , Xn) ∈ R(F1, · · · , Fn), where ≤cx denotes the convex order. By deﬁnition,
for a pair of random variables X and Y , we say that X is less that Y in the sense of convex

order, denoted as X ≤cx Y , if Ef (X) ≤ Ef (Y ) for every convex function f , provided

that expectations Ef (X) and Ef (Y ) exist. In actuarial science, it is common to deﬁne

convex order by using a stop-loss transform: X ≤cx Y ⇔ EX = EY and X ≤sl Y . Here

X is said to precede Y in the stop-loss order sense, notation X ≤sl Y , if and only if X

has lower stop-loss premiums than Y :

E(X − d)+ ≤ E(Y − d)+, −∞ < d < ∞.

A summary of other characterizations and properties of convex order can be found e.g.

in Denuit et al. (2005), Shaked and Shanthikumar (2007).

Comonotonicity plays a crucial role in determining convex upper bound on aggregate

sum. Let us recall the deﬁnition. For any X ∈ R(F1, · · · , Fn), X is said to be comonotonic
if

FX(x) = min
1≤k≤n

Fk(xk), ∀ x = (x1, x2, · · · , xn) ∈ Rn.

In particular, if (Ω, F , P ) is standard and atomless, then X

n (U)),
where U is a random variable uniformly distributed on the interval [0, 1], denoted as U ∼

1 (U), · · · , F −1

d= (F −1

U[0, 1]. The concept of comonotonicity was introduced by Yaari (1987) and Schmeidler

(1986). For more details and other characterizations about the concept of comonotonicity

and its applications in actuarial science and ﬁnance, we refer to the overview papers by

Dhaene et al.(2002a, 2002b) and more recently in Deelstra et al. (2010). Let S be the sum
X1 + · · · + Xn and S c be the comonotonic sum X c
n) is the
comonotonic counterpart of X = (X1, · · · , Xn). A well-known result between the sums S

n, where (X c

1 + · · · + X c

1, · · · , X c

2

and S c says that S ≤cx S c. Proofs of this fundamental result in the bivariate case can be
found in Dhaene and Goovaerts (1996, 1997). M¨uller (1997) extended the result to higher

dimensions as a special case of the concept of supermodular ordering. A simple geometric

argument is given in Kaas et al. (2002) and Cheung (2010) provided a new proof using

the theory of majorization. The converse remains valid under the assumption that all

marginal distribution functions are continuous and that the underlying probability space

(Ω, F , P) is atomless; see Cheung (2008). This continuity assumption on the marginals

was removed by Cheung (2010). A new and simple proof without the assumption that

the underlying probability space (Ω, F , P) is atomless was given by Mao and Hu (2011).

To summarize above results we arrived at the following theorem.

Theorem 1.1. If (X ∗

1 , · · · , X ∗

n) ∈ R(F1, · · · , Fn), then (X ∗

1 , · · · , X ∗

n) is comonotonic if,

and only if

X1 + · · · + Xn ≤cx X ∗

1 + · · · + X ∗

n for all (X1, · · · , Xn) ∈ R(F1, · · · , Fn).

Now we focus on the lower convex bound of R(F1, · · · , Fn). When n = 2, the minimum

sharp bound is obtained by the counter-monotonic scenario:

F −1
1 (U) + F −1

1 (1 − U) ≤cx X1 + X2 for any (X1, X2) ∈ R(F1, F2),

where U is a random variable uniformly distributed on the interval [0, 1]; see, for example,

Dhaene and Goovaerts (1999). Moreover, Cheung and Lo (2013) shows that the converse

remains valid. However, the sharp lower convex bound for n ≥ 3 is missing in the literature

due to the fact that counter-monotonicity cannot be generalized to n ≥ 3 without losing
its minimality with respect to convex order. In a special case, when F1, · · · , Fn are on R+
i=1(1 − Fi(0)) ≤ 1, the convex lower bound is obtained by the mutually exclusive

with Pn

scenario:

X ∗

1 + · · · + X ∗

n ≤cx X1 + · · · + Xn

for any (X1, · · · , Xn) ∈ R(F1, · · · , Fn), where (X ∗
0, X ∗

i >
j > 0) = 0 for all i 6= j; see Dhaene and Denuit (1999, Theorem 10). When the
marginals F1, F2, · · · , Fn are two-point distributions, the result can be found in Hu and
Wang (1999). Mutual exclusivity can be considered as the strongest negative dependence

n) ∈ R(F1, · · · , Fn) and P (X ∗

1 , · · · , X ∗

structure in a multivariate setting. It was ﬁrst studied in Dhaene and Denuit (1999), and

recently revisited, generalized and further characterized in Cheung and Lo (2014).

Deﬁnition 1.1. (Cheung and Lo (2014)) Let X1, · · · , Xn be random variables with es-
sential inﬁma l1, · · · , ln and essential suprema u1, · · · , un respectively. They are said to

3

be

(i) mutually exclusive from below if P (Xi > li, Xj > lj) = 0 for all i 6= j;

(ii) mutually exclusive from above if P (Xi < ui, Xj < uj) = 0 for all i 6= j.

The most recent result, due to Cheung and Lo (2014), concerning mutually exclusive

random variables and the minimal lower bound in convex order.

Theorem 1.2. (Cheung and Lo (2014)) Let X∗ = (X ∗

1 , · · · , X ∗

in R(F1, · · · , Fn) (n ≥ 3) which satisﬁes Pn

X∗ is mutually exclusive if and only if

i=1(1 − Fi(li)) ≤ 1 or Pn

n) be a ﬁxed random vector
i=1 Fi(ui−) ≤ 1. Then

X ∗

1 + · · · + X ∗

n ≤cx X1 + · · · + Xn

for all (X1, · · · , Xn) ∈ R(F1, · · · , Fn).

In this short note, we give a new proof of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2. The proof is given in

the next two sections.

2 A new proof of Theorem 1.1

To prove Theorem 1.1, we need two useful lemmas. Here are some notations. Let FX be

the cumulative distribution function of random variable X and the decumulative distri-
bution function is denoted by ¯FX , i.e. ¯FX (x) = 1 − FX(x) = P (X > x). A distortion
function is deﬁned as a non-decreasing function g : [0, 1] → [0, 1] such that g(0) = 0 and

g(1) = 1. The distortion risk measure associated with distortion function g is denoted by

ρg[·] and is deﬁned by

ρg[X] = Z +∞

0

g( ¯FX(x))dx +Z 0

−∞

[g( ¯FX(x)) − 1]dx,

for any random variable X, provided at least one of the two integrals above is ﬁnite. If

X a non-negative random variable, then ρg reduces to

ρg[X] = Z +∞

0

g( ¯FX(x))dx.

In view of Dhaene et al. (2012, Theorems 4 and 6) we know that, when the distortion

function g is concave on [0, 1], then ρg[X] may be rewritten as

ρg[X] = Z[0,1]

V aR1−q[X]dg(q),

4

where V aRp[X] = inf{x|FX(x) ≥ p}.

The following theorem shows that stop-loss order can be characterized in terms of

ordered concave distortion risk measures; see Dhaene et al. (2000) and Dhaene et al.

(2006). Here we provide a short proof.

Lemma 2.1. For any random pair (X, Y ) we have that X ≤sl Y if and only if their

respective concave distortion risk measures are ordered: X ≤sl Y ⇔ ρg[X] ≤ ρg[Y ] for all

concave distortion functions g. In particular, if E[X]=E[Y], then X ≤cx Y ⇔ ρg[X] ≤

ρg[Y ] for all concave distortion functions g.

Proof For any concave distortion function g, ρg can be written as

ρg[X] = g′

+(0)EX +Z 1

0

T V aRw[X]dµ(w),

where µ is a probability measure and T V aRw is the tail value-at -risk at level w:

T V aRw[X] =

1

1 − w Z 1

w

V aRp[X]dp.

which is a distortion risk measure corresponding to the concave distortion function

g(x) = min(cid:26) x

1 − w

, 1(cid:27) , 0 < w < 1.

The result follows as X ≤sl Y ⇔ T V aRw[X] ≤ T V aRw[Y ] for all w ∈ (0, 1) (see Theorem

3.2 in Dhaene et al. (2006)).

The following subadditivity theorem can be found in Dhaene et al. (2000), the bivari-

ate case can be found in Denneberg (1994), see also Wang and Dhaene (1998).

Lemma 2.2. For any concave distortion function g and (X1, · · · , Xn) ∈ R(F1, · · · , Fn),
we have

ρg[X1 + · · · + Xn] ≤ ρg[X1] + · · · + ρg[Xn].

Proof of Theorem 1.1 First we assume (X ∗

n) ∈ R(F1, · · · , Fn) is comono-
tonic. For any concave distortion function g and (X1, · · · , Xn) ∈ R(F1, · · · , Fn), By
Lemma 2.2 we have

1 , · · · , X ∗

ρg[X1 + · · · + Xn] ≤ ρg[X1] + · · · + ρg[Xn].

(2.1)

5

Comonotonicity of (X ∗

1 , · · · , X ∗

n) ∈ R(F1, · · · , Fn) implies that (cf. Dhaene et al. (2006))

ρg[X ∗

1 ] + · · · + ρg[X ∗

n] = ρg[X ∗

1 + · · · + X ∗
n].

Note that

ρg[X ∗

1 ] + · · · + ρg[X ∗

n] = ρg[X1] + · · · + ρg[Xn].

Therefore, combining (2.1), (2.2) with (2.3) one has

ρg[X1 + · · · + Xn] ≤ ρg[X ∗

1 + · · · + X ∗
n],

and the desired result follows from Lemma 2.1.

(2.2)

(2.3)

To prove the other implication, we assume that (X ∗

1 , · · · , X ∗

n) ∈ R(F1, · · · , Fn) and

X1 + · · · + Xn ≤cx X ∗

1 + · · · + X ∗

n for all (X1, · · · , Xn) ∈ R(F1, · · · , Fn).

From Lemma 2.1 we have that

ρg[X1 + · · · + Xn] ≤ ρg[X ∗

1 + · · · + X ∗
n],

for all concave distortion functions g. In particular,

ρg[X c

1 + · · · + X c

n] ≤ ρg[X ∗

1 + · · · + X ∗
n],

(2.4)

where (X c

1, · · · , X c

n) is the comonotonic counterpart of (X1, · · · , Xn). On the other hand,

by Lemma 2.2 we get

ρg[X ∗

1 + · · · + X ∗

n] ≤ ρg[X ∗

1 ] + · · · + ρg[X ∗
n].

If (X ∗

1 , · · · , X ∗

n) is not comonotonic, then

ρg[X ∗

1 + · · · + X ∗

n] 6= ρg[X ∗

1 ] + · · · + ρg[X ∗
n],

which, together with (2.5) leads to

ρg[X ∗

1 + · · · + X ∗

n] < ρg[X ∗

1 ] + · · · + ρg[X ∗
n].

It follows from (2.4) and (2.6) that

ρg[X c

1] + · · · + ρg[X c

n] < ρg[X ∗

1 ] + · · · + ρg[X ∗
n],

(2.5)

(2.6)

which is obviously a contradiction. Thus, (X ∗

1 , · · · , X ∗

n) is comonotonic. This ends the

proof of Theorem 1.1.

3 A new proof of Theorem 1.2

To prove Theorem 1.2, we need two useful lemmas. Lemma 3.1 gives a necessary and

suﬃcient condition for convex order of two rvs which was given in Proposition 3.4.3 of

Denuit et al. (2005).

Lemma 3.1. (Denuit et al. (2005, Proposition 3.4.3)) Given two rvs X and Y , then

the following statements are equivalent:

(1) X ≤cx Y .

(2) E[v(X)] ≤ E[v(Y )] for all convex functions v such that the expectations exist.

(3) E[v(X)] ≤ E[v(Y )] for all functions v with v′′ ≥ 0 such that the expectations exist.

The following lemma, due to Cheung and Lo (2013), will play a crucial role in the

proof of Theorem 1.2.

Lemma 3.2. Cheung and Lo (2013, Theorem 3.1) Let X1, · · · , Xn be non-negative ran-

dom variables and f be a convex function such that E[f (Pn

i=1 Xi)] exists.

(i) We have

E[f (

n

Xi=1

Xi)] ≥

n

Xi=1

E[f (Xi)] − (n − 1)f (0);

(ii) if f is strictly convex, then

E[f (

n

Xi=1

Xi)] =

n

Xi=1

E[f (Xi)] − (n − 1)f (0)

if and only if X1, · · · , Xn are mutually exclusive random variables in the sense of Dhaene
and Denuit (1999).

Remark 3.1. We remark that the “if part” is still true when the function f is convex,

but not necessarily strictly convex.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. To prove Theorem 1.2 there are three cases to consider.

7

Case 1. l1 = · · · = ln = 0. First we assume (X ∗

n) ∈ R(F1, · · · , Fn) is mutually
exclusive. For any convex function u and (X1, · · · , Xn) ∈ R(F1, · · · , Fn), By Lemma 3.3
(i) we have

1 , · · · , X ∗

E[u(

n

Xi=1

Xi)] ≥

n

Xi=1

E[u(Xi)] − (n − 1)u(0).

(3.1)

Thanks to Lemma 3.2 (ii) and Remark 3.1, mutual exclusivity of (X ∗

1 , · · · , X ∗

n) implies

that

E[u(

n

Xi=1

X ∗

i )] =

n

Xi=1

E[u(X ∗

i )] − (n − 1)u(0).

(3.2)

Therefore, combining (3.1) with (3.2), and note that E[u(X ∗

1 )] + · · · + E[u(X ∗

n)] =

E[u(X1)] + · · · + E[u(Xn)], one has

E[u(

n

Xi=1

X ∗

i )] ≤ E[u(

n

Xi=1

Xi)],

from which and Lemma 3.1, we deduce that

X ∗

1 + · · · + X ∗

n ≤cx X1 + · · · + Xn

for all (X1, · · · , Xn) ∈ R(F1, · · · , Fn).

To prove the other implication, we assume that (X ∗

1 , · · · , X ∗

n) ∈ R(F1, · · · , Fn) and

X ∗

1 + · · · + X ∗

n ≤cx X1 + · · · + Xn for all (X1, · · · , Xn) ∈ R(F1, · · · , Fn).

From Lemma 3.1 we have that

E[u(X ∗

1 + · · · + X ∗

n)] ≤ E[u(X1 + · · · + Xn)]

for all convex functions u. In particular,

E[u(X ∗

1 + · · · + X ∗

n)] ≤ E[u(X M

1 + · · · + X M

n )]

(3.3)

where (X M

1 , · · · , X M

n ) is the mutually exclusive counterpart of (X1, · · · , Xn). On the

other hand, by Lemma 3.2 and Remark 3.1 we get

E[u(X ∗

1 + · · · + X ∗

n)] ≥ E[u(X ∗

1 )] + · · · + E[u(X ∗

n))] − (n − 1)u(0),

and

E[u(X M

1 + · · · + X M

n )] = E[u(X M

1 )] + · · · + E[u(X M

n ))] − (n − 1)u(0),

8

(3.4)

(3.5)

If (X ∗

1 , · · · , X ∗

n) is not mutually exclusive, then

E[u(X ∗

1 + · · · + X ∗

n)] 6= E[u(X ∗

1 )] + · · · + E[u(X ∗

n))] − (n − 1)u(0).

(3.6)

Combining (3.3)-(3.5) with (3.6) we get

E[u(X ∗

1 )] + · · · + E[u(X ∗

n))] < E[u(X M

1 )] + · · · + E[u(X M

n ))].

This contradicts that (X ∗

that (X ∗
