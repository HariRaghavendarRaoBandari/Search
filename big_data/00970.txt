We observe electromagnetically induced absorption in π driven, degenerate two-level transitions where
F (cid:48) − F = 0, +1. The signal is observed through saturated absorption spectroscopy of the (6s2) 1S0 − (6s6p) 3P1
transition in 171Yb, where the nuclear spin I = 1/2. The enhanced absorption signal is used to generate a
dispersive curve for 556 nm laser frequency stabilisation and the stabilised light cools 171Yb atoms in a two-
stage magneto-optical trap, achieving temperatures of 20 µK. The Doppler-free spectroscopy scheme is further
used to measure isotopic frequency shifts and hyperﬁne separations for the intercombination line in ytterbium.

Introduction

Neutral ytterbium ﬁnds a niche in many ultra-cold
atom explorations; examples include degenerate Fermi
gases [1–3], artiﬁcial gauge potentials [4–6], quantum
many body simulations [7, 8] and atomic clocks [9–13],
along with the potential application in quantum compu-
tation [14]. In the majority of instances the intercom-
bination line (1S0 − 3P1) is used for laser cooling, typ-
ically in a magneto-optical trap. With a Doppler cool-
ing limit of 4.5 µK the low temperatures are conducive
to a range of applications; for example, loading optical
lattice traps and from there producing all optical Bose-
Einstein condensates [15] or degenerate Fermi gases [1,3].
With a natural line-width of 184 kHz the full potential of
the laser cooling is only attainable if the frequency noise
of the 556 nm light is suﬃciently low. One solution is
to use an optical cavity with a reasonably high ﬁnesse
and low frequency drift to stabilise the 556 nm light fre-
quency [16, 17]. An alternative is to lock the green light
to an element of a well stabilised frequency comb [18]. A
further means is to lock to the center of a Doppler proﬁle
produced with a thermal atomic beam [19,20]. This helps
maintain long term stability of the green light; however,
keeping the frequency excursions close to 180 kHz is chal-
lenging [21]. Here we demonstrate a means of conferring
short-to-long term frequency stability on 556 nm light
without the need for an optical cavity or frequency comb
lock. We use frequency-modulated spectroscopy where
the 556 nm beam intersects a Yb atomic beam at nor-
mal incidence, and reﬂect the beam with a lens-mirror
combination to create a pump-probe scheme for ﬂuores-
cence spectroscopy. Unexpectedly, we observe enhanced
absorption (rather than saturation) behaviour in satu-
rated absorption spectroscopy (SAS) for both of the hy-
perﬁne lines in the 1S0 − 3P1 transition of 171Yb. The
eﬀect occurs when a small DC magnetic ﬁeld, of the or-
der of a few hundredths of a millitesla, is applied across

the interaction zone. The ﬁeld strength is below that re-
quired to resolve the Zeeman sub-levels; though, is still
apparent when the Zeeman sub-levels are separated. We
have identiﬁed the enhanced absorption as a form of elec-
tromagnetically induced absorption (EIA) due to similar-
ities with predictions, such as that by Goren et al. [22].
However, the pump-probe scheme used in the model dif-
fers from that used in the experiment here. Doppler-free
spectroscopy in Yb for frequency stabilisation of 556 nm
light has been reported previously, but without reference
to detail [3]. We also note that there is recent discussion
about coherent population trapping with the intercom-
bination line in 174Yb [23, 24]. A characteristic that we
share with these investigations is that there is saturation
of the transition by both pump and probe ﬁelds.

The instability of the 556 nm light frequency, locked
to the EIA resonance,
is assessed by use of an opti-
cal frequency comb whose mode spacing is referenced to
a hydrogen maser. Further validation of the the green
light’s frequency instability is performed by using the
556 nm light in a two-stage magneto-optical trap of 171Yb
(F (cid:48) = 3/2), producing temperatures below 20 µK with a
standard deviation of 2 µK across nearly sixty sequential
measurements.

Our setup also enables a measure of frequency diﬀer-
ences between isotopic lines and hyperﬁne separations
with statistical uncertainties of 60 kHz or less for most
of the frequency intervals. These are determined via ab-
solute optical frequency measurements [25]. We provide a
summary of these measurements and compare with previ-
ous reports. Relatively good agreement is found, though a
number of frequency separations diﬀer by more than two
standard deviations. High-resolution spectroscopy on the
Yb intercombination line has previously been performed
via V -type double-resonance spectroscopy, but without
quantitative frequency measurements [26].

This paper is organised as follows. Section 1 describes

the experimental details for the saturated absorption
spectroscopy (SAS) and frequency measurements, Sect.
2 presents the spectra generated from the saturated ab-
sorption spectroscopy and gives information pertaining
to the enhanced absorption, Sect. 3 describes the two-
stage laser cooling scheme of 171Yb and presents results
related to the stabilisation of the 556 nm light, and Sect.
4 summarises the isotopic frequency shift measurements
carried out with the saturated absorption scheme.

The saturated absorption scheme comprises a retro-

2

reﬂected 556 nm beam at right angles to the atomic
beam and the 556 nm ﬂuorescence is detected by a photo-
multiplier tube (Hamamatsu H10492-003). We take ad-
vantage of the Yb atomic beam leading to a magneto-
optical trap (MOT) used for clock line spectroscopy [25].
Frequency modulation at 33 kHz is applied to the light
via an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) allowing for third
harmonic detection with a lock-in ampliﬁer. Helmholtz
coils in close vicinity of the saturated absorption zone
are used to set the magnetic ﬁeld in the vertical direc-
tion. For isotopic frequency shift measurements, the mag-
netic ﬁeld is set to cancel the vertical component of the
Earth’s B-ﬁeld (0.059 mT upward), and the polarisation
of the 556 nm light is set vertically (i.e. parallel to that
of B when it is non-zero). The zero B-ﬁeld condition has
been determined by several means; one of which is to ro-
tate the light polarisation by 90◦ and observe the Zeeman
splitting, which is stronger for the σ transitions. The in-
tensity proﬁle of the 556 nm beam is elliptical with the
major axis aligned with the atomic beam.
The temperature of the oven (Createc, GmbH) is main-
tained at 430◦C producing an eﬀusion of Yb atoms
through a trio of stainless steel tubes with a diameter
of 1 mm and length 20 mm. The green ﬂuorescence passes
through a spatial ﬁltering scheme to minimise stray light.
We estimate the ﬂow rate of Yb atoms through the
556 nm beams to be ∼4(3)×1013 s−1 based on molecu-
lar ﬂow rates through a cylindrical tube [27] (an esti-
mate based on ﬂuorescence detection is an order of mag-
nitude less). Based on a mean velocity of 320 m s−1 and
an intensity well above saturation, the number of absorp-
tion/emission cycles is about 15 per atom as the atoms
traverse the pump and probe beams. The 556 nm light
is produced via resonant frequency doubling of 1112 nm
light, which is generated from a commercial ﬁber laser
that injection-locks a diode laser [28]. A bow-tie conﬁgu-
ration doubling cavity uses an 18 mm length periodically
poled potassium titanyl phosphate crystal for the non-
linear conversion and 75 mm radius of curvature focus-
ing mirrors. The line-width of the 556 nm radiation has
been found to be no greater than 410 kHz [28]. Based
on the manufacturer speciﬁcations for the ﬁber laser, the
line-width of the green light should be below 240 kHz −
slightly larger than the natural line-width of the inter-
combination line.

For generating the spectra the 556 nm light frequency
is slowly swept via a piezo transducer in the ﬁber laser.
We calibrate the frequency span by use of a frequency
comb. There is 0.8 mW of 1112 nm light combined with
the nearest comb element on an avalanche photodiode to
produce an RF beat signal with 29 dB signal-to-noise ra-
tio (SNR) with 500 kHz resolution bandwidth. The beat
signal is ﬁltered with a 10 MHz wide (−3 dB) band pass
ﬁlter centered at 30 MHz. The frequency comb, referenced
to a hydrogen maser, is used to make frequency measure-
ments for all of the Yb isotopic lines, except for 168Yb
with 0.13 % relative abundance and 173Yb (F (cid:48) = 3/2)

2.7 × 10−4 times weaker than the upper state splitting,
it seems to be the mechanism that permits the enhance-
ment in the light absorption. The Rabi frequency for the
pump is ∼1.2 MHz, while that for the retro-reﬂected probe
beam is approximately 5 % less.

A partial explanation for the behaviour is provided
by Goren et al. [22] where they predict the occurrence
of electromagnetically induced absorption in degenerate
two-level transitions; however, they use σ+ polarised light
in their model (for both pump and probe beams). They
stipulate that F (cid:48) = F + 1 and F > 1, whereas we
also ﬁnd it manifest for F (cid:48) = F = 1/2. An explana-
tion for this latter behaviour is perhaps described by a
prediction by Dasgupta, where quantum interference in
J = 1/2 ↔ J = 1/2 transitions open up an extra path-
way [33]. However, these analyses considered alkali atoms
where the diﬀerence in the Zeeman shift for the upper and
lower states was less than a factor of 10. An earlier analy-
sis of driven degenerate two-level atomic systems was car-
ried out, where the probe intensity was taken to be below
saturation and bias B-ﬁelds were not considered [34]. To
our knowledge there are no models investigating F (cid:48) = F
systems with a J = 0 ground state, granting large dif-
ferences in the Zeeman shift between ground and excited
states. The analysis by Vafafard et al. [24] is partly rele-
vant given that they studied the intercombination of yt-
terbium for a saturated pump-probe scheme; however,
their analysis was for 174Yb, which has a non-degenerate
ground state. We believe the enhanced absorption signal
observed here is due to a four-level dynamic rather than
three, because the signal contrast is diﬀerent for the two
hyperﬁne lines with diﬀerent sub-level branching ratios.
We note that the 171Yb EIA signal occurs before the
Zeeman sub-levels become resolved, but is still present as
the pair of Zeeman lines separate when B (cid:38) 0.5 mT, as
seen in Fig. 4, which was recorded for the F (cid:48) = 1/2 line.
Enhanced absorption (or an inverted Lamb dip) has been
observed previously in SAS; for example, in 133Cs [35] and
40Ca [36]. In the former case the enhanced absorption oc-
curs with a change in F or in crossover resonances. For
example, the saturation behaviour depends strongly on
the magnetic ﬁeld for the F = 2 → 2, 3 crossover reso-
nance. The level system in 171Yb is simpler with only four
Zeeman sub-states involved. For 40Ca the inverted dip oc-
curs for a particular range of intensity levels and forms
a triplet at high intensity. In our case the enhanced ab-
sorption is manifest for the 556 nm beam intensity range
= 1.4 W m−2 is the
of 18 I (556)
saturation intensity for the 1S0− 3P1 transition (we have
stated the combined intensity of the two beams). The
only changes that occur to the line are an enhanced SNR
with some line broadening, though both appear to be-
come constant above about 150 I (556)
the
signal is too weak to discern, so it is not clear what hap-
pens near saturation.

of the 1S0− 3P1 line of 171Yb (F (cid:48) = 1/2) for two values of magnetic
ﬁeld: (i) near zero ﬁeld and (ii) B = 0.39 mT. A vertical oﬀset is
applied for clarity. The result in trace (ii) occurs for both directions
of the applied B-ﬁeld. (b) The integrated dispersive proﬁles of (a).
The averaging time per data point was 0.2 s.

A comparison of the dispersive spectra for 171Yb (F (cid:48) =
1/2) at two diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld strengths is shown
in Fig. 2. Trace (a) with zero B-ﬁeld shows the usual
saturated absorption feature (or Lamb dip), while at
∼0.39 mT there is a strong inversion of the dip showing
enhanced absorption. The enhancement is seen for both
magnetic ﬁeld directions and for both 171Yb lines, how-
ever the eﬀect is more pronounced with 171Yb (F (cid:48) = 1/2).
The strength of the enhanced absorption is reduced by
about 30 % (normalised with respect to the Doppler back-
ground) in the case of 171Yb (F (cid:48) = 3/2).
The branching ratios for the de-excitation are readily
calculated for the 171Yb (F (cid:48) = 1/2) and 171Yb (F (cid:48) = 3/2)
systems [29]. We illustrate these in Fig. 3. For 171Yb
(F (cid:48) = 1/2) the probability of the downward σ transitions
is 2/3 while for 171Yb (F (cid:48) = 3/2) it is 1/3. This corre-
lates with the eﬀect being more pronounced for F (cid:48) = 1/2.
The factors relevant here are the natural line-width of
the transition (Γ(556) = 184 kHz), the Zeeman shift of the
3P1 mF levels (±14 MHz mT−1) and the Zeeman shift of
the ground state mF levels (±3.76 kHz mT−1). The lat-
ter is evaluated with ∆ω = gF µBmF B/, where gF is
the Land´e g-factor and µB is the Bohr magneton. For
the case of hyperﬁne states in an external magnetic ﬁeld
with J = 0 and F = I the Land´e g-factor simpliﬁes to
become

where the ﬁrst quotient is the ratio of nuclear and Bohr

µI /µN we take the value of 0.49367(1) from published ta-
bles [32]. Although the ground state Zeeman splitting is

is within 3 MHz of the 171Yb (F (cid:48) = 3/2) line and higher
in frequency [37, 38].

50 ms the violet light is switched oﬀ and the atoms are fur-
ther cooled with the 556 nm light. The dual-MOT scheme
is depicted in Fig. 1(b). The 399 nm and 556 nm laser
beams are combined with long-wavelength pass ﬁlters for
each of the MOT beams, and achromatic quarter wave
plates are used to set the handedness of the circular polar-
isation (simultaneously for both wavelengths). Since the
399 nm light is responsible for the initial capturing of the
Yb atoms, the 556 nm beam diameter in the MOT can be
set small, so posing less need for high power (through, at
the expense of more stringent alignment conditions). The
556 nm beam radius (e−2) is 2.0 mm and approximately
9 mW in total from the six beams reaches the atoms.

The diﬀerence frequency of RF signals driving two
acousto-optic modulators is used to set the frequency de-
tuning of the 556 nm MOT light, where one AOM shifts
the frequency of the light sent to the saturation absorp-
tion scheme and the other the MOT light. The transfer
eﬃciency is found to be highest for a frequency detuning
of −6.1 MHz or about −33 Γ(556).

Fig. 4. The dispersive curves produced through saturated absorp-
tion for 171Yb (F (cid:48) = 1/2) with diﬀerent levels of bias magnetic
ﬁeld. The Zeeman sub-levels of the upper state begin to appear at
the higher B-ﬁeld strengths.

The enhanced absorption signal of 171Yb (F (cid:48) = 3/2)
is used to stabilise the frequency of the 556 nm light by
locking to the center of the dispersion curve. The correc-
tion signal is sent to the piezo transducer in the 1112 nm
master ﬁber laser with a servo bandwidth of a few Hertz.
The instability of the 556 nm light frequency was assessed
by counting the beat signal frequency generated by the
heterodyning of 1112 nm light with an adjacent element
of the frequency comb. As mentioned, the mode spac-
ing (and oﬀset frequency) of the comb were referenced
to a hydrogen maser. The instability at 1 s integration
time is approximately 70 kHz (for the carrier frequency
corresponding to 556 nm) and integrates down as τ−1/2,
reducing to 6 kHz after 100 s of integration time.

3. Laser Cooling

This stabilised 556 nm light is used in a two-stage laser
cooling scheme, where atoms are ﬁrst trapped with
399 nm light and a quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld; then for

two-stage magneto-optical trap. I, intensity; D, detection period;
∆tR, free expansion duration; IS = 595 W m−2 and 1.4 W m−2 for
the 1S0 − 1P1 and 1S0 − 3P1 transitions, respectively; δ represents
the frequency detuning from line-center. Γ(399) = 2π × 28.9 × 106
rad s−1 and Γ(556) = 2π×184×103 rad s−1. The additional cooling
phase produced by the 556 nm light occurs over the period ∆tC ,
set to 50 ms. ∆tC and ∆tR are not drawn to scale.

Temperature measurements were performed by record-
ing the free expansion of the atom cloud on a CCD;
each successive image is generated through the reload-
ing and release of the MOT [39] (the initial release time
was 1 ms and incremented in 0.75 ms steps for a series
of ﬁve frames, the CCD exposure time was 1 ms). The
optical imaging and ﬁltering scheme produces a magni-
ﬁcation of unity. The event sequence for the dual-colour
MOT is summarised in Fig. 5, and Fig. 6 shows a succes-
sion of temperature and cloud radius measurements. Here
the 399 nm light was switched oﬀ for 50 ms before the re-
lease of the remaining electromagnetic ﬁelds. Apart from
the free expansion period, the magnetic quadrupole ﬁeld
was held ﬁxed at 0.42 T m−1 (axial direction). This value

was calculated based on the design of the MOT coils and
current. We found that a reduction in B-ﬁeld gradient
for the 556 nm MOT loading did not aid in the trans-
fer (further discussion below). The frequency detuning,
δ, of the 556 nm light was at a −33 Γ(556) for the transfer
and then swept to −17 Γ(556) in concurrence with a re-
duction in intensity to ∼200 I (556)
, from a maximum of
103I (556)
. Ramping down the intensity of the 556 nm light
is found to have inﬂuence only when used in combination
with a reduction in δ. The uncertainties given by the er-
ror bars are generated from the line ﬁtting of r2
rms versus
t2 produced by the free expansion of the atom cloud.
The weighted mean temperature is 18.2 µK and the ﬂuc-
tuation in temperature, as represented by the standard
deviation of the data set, is 2.0 µK. The low level of tem-
perature variation from shot to shot (or cycle to cycle) is
a good indication of the stability of the 556 nm laser fre-
quency and hence the merit of locking to the EIA signal.
Reducing the green light intensity closer to I (556)
has yet
to produce lower atomic cloud temperatures (where the
trapping force is still about ten times greater than that
due to gravity). For reference, the eﬀect of releasing the
atoms from the light ﬁelds only and not the quadrupole
B-ﬁeld is indicated by the two triangular data points in
Fig. 6.

to ∼5 I (399)

We note that the 556 nm light is shut oﬀ via switching
of the AOM’s RF drive. This leaves a residual 0.05 I (556)
of light intensity at the MOT. We conﬁrmed that this did
not inﬂuence the temperature measurements by use of a
physical shutter (Cambridge Technology) to switch the
556 nm beams on and oﬀ [40]. No change in the tempera-
ture recordings was evident. The limitation preventing
lower temperatures is still to be determined (as previ-
ously noted, the limit set by 1D Doppler cooling the-
ory is 4.5 µK). A likely inﬂuence is the Zeeman slower
beam, which remains on continuously and is only de-
tuned by −7 Γ(399) from the center of the 1S0 − 1P1
transition. However, variations of the Zeeman beam in-
tensity by 50 % (from ∼2.5 I (399)
) show no
discernible inﬂuence on the atomic cloud temperature.
Based on ion pump current readings the chamber pres-
sure was approximately 5×10−8 Pa (or 5×10−10 mbar).
Remaining higher frequency noise on the green light is a
possible reason given that we rely on the intrinsic line-
width of the 1112 nm master laser and servo bandwidth of
the resonant frequency doubling cavity. The 556 nm MOT
beams are also prone to very slight direction changes as
the frequency detuning is reduced. We have also studied
the temperature of the composite bosonic isotope 172Yb
with the same event sequence. Here there is no enhanced
absorption signal in the SAS, so the laser stabilising is
with respect to the more usual Lamb-dip signal. The
combination of reducing δ and the 556 nm intensity be-
fore the free expansion is very pronounced. We observe
a temperature reduction from 120 µK to 65 µK through
this additional cooling phase, which is carried out over
15 ms.

Fig. 6. Temperature and MOT cloud radius recorded for 171Yb
(F (cid:48) = 3
2 ) using the electromagnetically induced absorption signal
to stabilise the 556 nm light. The weighted mean temperature for
this sequence is 18.2± 2.0 µK. The two triangular data points show
the eﬀect of not releasing the atoms from the magnetic quadrupole
ﬁeld for the free expansion period.

The cloud radius (root-mean squared value) in Fig. 6
gives a mean value of about ∼0.18 mm. From the ﬂuo-
rescence received by a photo-multiplier tube (or with the
CCD, calibrated) we can infer the number of atoms in
the MOT. The collection eﬃciency is about 0.5 %, and
the PMT sensitivity is 0.085 V nW−1 for the choice of
gain setting. Taking into account the frequency detun-
ing and light intensity we estimate the number of 172Yb
atoms to be 2×106, corresponding to a (peak) density of
3×1010 cm−3. This number reduces by 40 % in the trans-
fer from the violet to green MOT and the number of
171Yb atoms trapped is ∼40 % that of 172Yb. The low
atom number is attributed to the low atomic ﬂux rate
from the oven, due to the conservative nozzle design. As
the need arises this nozzle will be replaced such that the
ﬂow rate is enhanced. A higher ﬂux rate is not antici-
pated to inﬂuence the atomic cloud temperature signiﬁ-
cantly (the present ﬂow rate of remaining thermal atoms
through the MOT cloud is roughly 1×109 s−1).

In previous work the transfer of atoms to the 556 nm
MOT is sometimes carried out with a reduction in the
magnetic ﬁeld gradient, dB/dz. In our case a reduction
in dB/dz reduces the transfer eﬃciency. The magnetic
ﬁeld gradient of 0.42 T m−1 for the green MOT, at ﬁrst,
appears surprisingly high. We can estimate the maximum
B-gradient by considering the adiabatic condition that
dB/dz < kΓ/2mvµ, where k is the wave number, m the
mass of the atom, v the velocity and µ is the Zeeman

Isotopic shifts and hyperﬁne separations

2 → 3

The saturated absorption scheme provides a convenient
means of measuring isotopic frequency shifts between
Yb isotopes and the hyperﬁne separations within the
fermionic isotopes. To our knowledge, sub-Doppler spec-
troscopy with quantitative measurements has not been
carried out previously on the 1S0 − 3P1 Yb lines. The
frequency comb (referred to above) is used to measure
absolute optical frequencies with respect to a hydrogen
maser for all the lines. For each transition [apart from
173Yb (F = 5
2 ) and 168Yb] the 556 nm light is
locked to the center of the saturated absorption dip and
the frequency of the optical comb beat is recorded with a
frequency counter, set to a gate time of 0.4 s, over a mean
duration of 200 s. The Allan deviation typically reduces to
∼10 kHz with the accumulated data. Our reported values
in Table 1 are the mean from six separate measurement
runs taken over the course of two months. During a single
run the absolute frequencies are measured within a two
hour period, hence factors that could aﬀect the absolute
frequencies, such as slight beam direction changes, are
made common to all the lines. We evaluate the frequency
separations with respect to the 176Yb isotopic line to aid
comparison with previous work. For convenience, in the
right most column we list the frequency separations with
2 → 7
respect to the lowest frequency line: 173Yb (F = 5
2 ).
These measurements were performed with a nulled mag-
netic ﬁeld avoiding separation of the Zeeman components
and the optical pumping behaviour described above. We
note that for the 171Yb (F’=3/2) line there is a ∼200 kHz
shift between the center of the enhanced absorption line
and the zero-B-ﬁeld line, while for the 171Yb (F (cid:48) = 1/2)
line this shift is below 40 kHz.

√
Our quoted uncertainties are the statistical uncer-
n − 1) produced over the n = 6 separate
tainties (σ/
measurement trials, rather than an evaluation of system-
atic shifts. This is done because the largest uncertainty

arises from identifying the line-center for the lock point,
rather than from systematic shifts. Note, even in the case
of line-center oﬀsets these will be largely common be-
tween the diﬀerent lines as the lock point on the discrim-
inator is not changed during a single measurement run
(though, prior to the frequency measurement, a scan of
the line was in most cases carried out to conﬁrm sym-
metry about the lock point). There will, however, be
an associated shift due to the diﬀerent line strengths,
which we estimate to be below 30 kHz when considering
the strongest and weakest lines. For the most abundant
isotopes the gain of the PMT was reduced to help min-
imise this shift. A statistical uncertainty over a number of
measurements should incorporate errors associated with
identifying the line-center. Shifts due to the Stark eﬀect
or frequency counting errors are well below the uncer-
tainties reported here (and would also be common to all
the lines). In support, a 556 nm beam intensity increase
by a factor of ten showed no measurable change to the
(absolute) frequencies.

Some of the frequency separations diﬀer by more
than two standard deviations in comparison to previ-
ous measurements; notably the separations to the 173Yb
(F (cid:48) = 7/2), 171Yb (F (cid:48) = 1/2) and 172Yb lines. In the
case of 171Yb (F (cid:48) = 3/2) we have better agreement with
Ref. [43]. We do not have an explanation for these dif-
ferences. As noted earlier, the 171Yb (F (cid:48) = 3/2) line is
neighboured with the 173Yb (F (cid:48) = 3/2) line. The latter
is only marginally visible with a +2.5 (3) MHz separation
from the former.

5. Conclusions

We have identiﬁed what we suspect is electromagnetically
induced absorption in a divalent atom by use of saturated
absorption spectroscopy where the transitions are driven
with linearly polarised pump and probe beams. It oc-
curs with the two hyperﬁne lines in neutral 171Yb when
a small magnetic bias ﬁeld is applied parallel to the light’s
polarisation. The pump and retro-reﬂected probe beams

6

are overlapped and orthogonal to a thermal atomic beam.
The quality factor of the EIA signal is ∼2×108. Only par-
tial explanations for the observed EIA have been found.
We deduce that the magnetic bias ﬁeld creates a sim-
ple optical pumping scheme that produces enhanced ab-
sorption rather than saturation via Zeeman splitting of
the J = 0 ground state. The EIA signal is not observed
in any of the other Yb isotopes, including 173Yb (where
I = 5/2) [44]. The F = 1/2 energy level structure of
the 171Yb intercombination line is not common and is
perhaps only shared with 199Hg and 111,113Cd, partly ex-
plaining why this precise EIA behaviour has not been
observed before.

A dispersive signal derived from the enhanced absorp-
tion signal is used to frequency stabilise 556 nm light and
in so doing enable laser cooling of 171Yb atoms in a dual-
stage magneto-optical trap. Atom-cloud temperatures of
∼20 µK are produced with cycle-to-cycle variations of
2 µK. This is achieved without the use of an optical ref-
erence cavity for high-frequency noise suppression. The
saturated absorption scheme has also provides the high-
est resolution measurements to date of the isotopic shifts
and hyperﬁne separations of the (6s2) 1S0 − (6s6p) 3P1
transition in ytterbium.
