ABSTRACT

Recent spectropolarimetric observations of active region ﬁlaments have revealed polarization pro-
ﬁles with signatures typical of the strong ﬁeld Zeeman regime. The conspicuous absence in those
observations of scattering polarization and Hanle eﬀect signatures was then pointed out by some
authors. This was interpreted either as a signature of mixed ”turbulent” ﬁeld components or as a
result of optical thickness. In this article, we present a natural scenario to explain these Zeeman-only
spectro-polarimetric observations of active region ﬁlaments. We propose a two-component model, one
on top of the other. Both components have horizontal ﬁelds, the azimuth diﬀerence between them
being close to 90 degrees. The component that lies lower in the atmosphere is permeated by a strong
ﬁeld of the order of 600 G, while the upper component has much weaker ﬁelds, of the order of 10 G.
The ensuing scattering polarization signatures of the individual components have opposite signs, so
that its combination along the line of sight reduces –and even can cancel out– the Hanle signatures,
giving rise to an apparent only-Zeeman proﬁle. This model is also applicable to other chromospheric
structures seen in absorption above active regions.

INTRODUCTION

Solar ﬁlaments are dark thready structures seen on the
disk as absorption in the core of some strong chromo-
spheric lines (such as Hα or Ca II lines), other weak chro-
mospheric lines such as the He I multiplets at 10830 ˚A
and 5876 ˚A (D3), and in the extreme ultraviolet con-
tinua. They are called prominences when they are seen
as diﬀuse bright clouds at the limb, as they scatter light
from the underlying disk. Broadly speaking, they can be
segregated in Active Region (AR) and Quiescent (QS)
ﬁlaments. The former lie above polarity inversion lines
(PILs; the observationally deﬁned line that delineates
opposite polarity magnetic ﬁelds) of active regions. The
latter lie above PILs in quiet Sun regions. QS ﬁlaments
are very long structures that often live for weeks or even
months, and that are suspended at heights up to 100
Mm (Mackay et al. 2010, and references therein). AR
ﬁlaments are formed in active regions, often in recur-
rent ﬂaring areas, and are shorter in length and life time
as compared to QS ﬁlaments. They are hardly seen as
prominences at the limb because they probably lie lower
in the atmosphere, at only a few Mm above the photo-
sphere (Mackay et al. 2010, and references therein).

From a physical point of view, solar ﬁlaments and
prominences are cool chromospheric plasma overdensities
embedded in the extremely hot and less dense corona.
Magnetic ﬁelds play a fundamental role in the formation,
support, and eruption of these structures. It is commonly
agreed that these dense structures are formed in local
dips of the magnetic ﬁeld (e.g. Kippenhahn & Schl¨uter
1957; Aulanier & D´emoulin 2003; L´opez Ariste et al.
2006). However, the magnetism of solar ﬁlaments and
prominences is very diﬃcult to constrain observationally
since it requires high precision spectro-polarimetric mea-
surements and the interpretation of signals coming from

the joint action of atomic polarization and the Hanle and
Zeeman eﬀects.

The He I 10830 ˚A and D3 multiplets are very use-
ful spectral lines to diagnose the dynamic and magnetic
properties of plasma structures at chromospheric tem-
peratures. One of the advantages is that the absorption
of these lines is usually negligible in quiet regions, so
that any absorption can be regarded as due to a levitat-
ing cloud at a certain height, which greatly simpliﬁes the
solution of the radiative transfer equation for polarized
radiation (Leroy et al. 1977; Sahal-Brechot et al. 1977;
Trujillo Bueno & Asensio Ramos 2007).
In particular,
these spectral lines have been widely used for the study
of solar prominences and ﬁlaments (e.g. Bommier et al.
1981; Casini et al. 2003; Merenda et al. 2006; Orozco
Su´arez et al. 2014; Mart´ınez Gonz´alez et al. 2015), the
reconstruction of magnetic ﬁelds in ﬂux emerging regions
(Solanki et al. 2003; Xu et al. 2010) and in chromospheric
spicules (e.g. L´opez Ariste & Casini 2005; Centeno et al.
2009; Mart´ınez Gonz´alez et al. 2012; Orozco Su´arez et al.
2015).

Spectro-polarimetric observations of QS ﬁlaments and
prominences revealed magnetic ﬁelds that have strengths
of the order of a few tens of G (Trujillo Bueno et al. 2002;
Casini et al. 2003; Merenda et al. 2006), where the lin-
ear polarization of the He I 10830 ˚A is dominated by the
atomic level polarization due to the anisotropic radia-
tion ﬁeld. Yet, stronger ﬁelds are found for the same
structures in active regions, in the range of 200-600 G
(Wiehr & Stellmacher 1991; Sasso et al. 2011). Even
larger ﬁeld strengths (up to 800 G) were obtained when
large, Zeeman-like linear polarization signatures were de-
tected in AR ﬁlaments (Kuckein et al. 2009, 2012; Xu
et al. 2012). The work of Kuckein et al. (2009) was the
ﬁrst to show such linear polarization proﬁles of the He I
10830 ˚A multiplet with the surprising typical symmetric

shape with three lobes of the transverse Zeeman eﬀect.
Trujillo Bueno & Asensio Ramos (2007) and Casini
et al. (2009) soon noted that, even for such strong ﬁelds,
AR ﬁlaments spectropolarimetric observations should
show signatures of scattering polarization and the Hanle
eﬀect. The obvious solution of having a magnetic ﬁeld
√
inclined by the Van Vleck angle (the angle that ful-
ﬁlls cos θV V = 1/
3 and for which the contribution of
scattering polarization vanishes, Landi Degl’Innocenti &
Landolﬁ 2004) in the whole ﬁlament looked clearly im-
probable (Kuckein et al. 2009). Trujillo Bueno & Asensio
Ramos (2007) pointed out that when the optical thick-
ness of the ﬁlament becomes larger than unity, radiative
transfer eﬀects start to play a role. In this case, the ra-
diation ﬁeld inside the ﬁlament becomes more horizontal
(parallel to the solar surface) and it can compensate to
some extent the predominantly vertical (along the ra-
dial direction) radiation ﬁeld that is pumping the He I
levels. Therefore, radiative transfer inside the ﬁlament
produces a reduction of the radiation ﬁeld anisotropy,
that leads to a strong reduction of the scattering po-
larization and Hanle eﬀect signals. Casini et al. (2009)
invoked the presence of a quasi-random magnetic ﬁeld co-
existing with the organized magnetic ﬁeld of a ﬁlament.
The isotropic component of the magnetic ﬁeld strongly
reduces the Hanle signal produced by the deterministic
ﬁeld.

In this article, we propose a scenario based on a two-
component model that naturally explains the predomi-
nantly Zeeman proﬁles observed in AR ﬁlaments. As a
consequence of the model, we infer the presence of weak
magnetic ﬁelds in AR ﬁlaments. The proposed scenario
is extensive to other structures seen in absorption to-
wards the solar disk in lines such as the He I multiplets
(e.g., ﬁlaments, ﬁbrils in emerging ﬂux regions, . . . ).

HE I MULTIPLETS

knowledge,

spectro-
in
polarimetric observations of absorption features
the He I multiplets have been carried out using a single
atmospheric component, as if the observed signal was
generated only in the cool plasma overdensities. Even
so, these structures (QS and AR ﬁlaments, ﬁbrils in
emerging ﬂux regions, . . . ) usually have optical depths
below or of the order of unity1 (Kuckein et al. 2009,
2012; Sasso et al. 2011; Xu et al. 2012). Consequently, it
is reasonable to think that the emergent polarization sig-
nal can have some contribution from underlying layers.
This poses no problem in quiet regions because the He I
multiplets yield almost no absorption. However, this
turns out to be problematic in active regions because,
for instance, their chromospheres produce a signiﬁcant
absorption in these multiplets.

We then propose a two-component approach to model
the observed Stokes proﬁles of absorption features above
active regions in the He I multiplets. This simpliﬁed
model is made of two slabs with constant physical prop-
erties, one (slab 2) on top of the other (slab 1).
In-
terestingly, this model allows us to naturally reproduce
the Zeeman-only Stokes parameters observed by Kuck-

ein et al. (2009) in AR ﬁlaments without any addi-
tional mechanism to reduce the radiation ﬁeld anisotropy.
In such scenario, the emergent Stokes parameters I =
(I, Q, U, V )† (with the † symbol denoting transpose) can
be written as (Trujillo Bueno 2003):

where Isun is the Stokes vector that illuminates the lower
boundary of the slab (essentially the photospheric contin-
uum), K∗ = K/ηI is the propagation matrix normalized
to the absorption coeﬃcient for Stokes I, S = /ηI is
the source function vector, with  = (I , Q, U , V )† the
emissivity vector (see Landi Degl’Innocenti & Landolﬁ
2004; Asensio Ramos et al. 2008, for more details) and
1 the identity matrix. The previous expression considers
two slabs with diﬀerent optical depths (τ1 and τ2) and
diﬀerent magnetic ﬁelds.

In some sense, our approach galvanizes from an idea
proposed by Judge (2009). This work suggested that the
polarization signals observed in the 10830 ˚A multiplet in
ﬁlamentary structures in emerging ﬂux regions might not
mainly come from the highest part, but from the low-
lying chromosphere of the active region. Judge (2009)
argues that it is diﬃcult to distinguish the two possi-
bilities because the Stokes proﬁles would look very simi-
lar. Previous observations reinforce this idea because the
photospheric and chromospheric magnetic ﬁeld maps ob-
tained using inversion techniques look astonishingly sim-
ilar. The chromospheric maps look slightly more fuzzy
because of the reduction in the gas pressure with height
and the ensuing expansion, but no hint on any ﬁlamen-
tary structure is detected (Solanki et al. 2003; Xu et al.
2010; Asensio Ramos & Trujillo Bueno 2010). We go one
step forward and stand on the idea suggested by Asen-
sio Ramos & Trujillo Bueno (2010) to propose that what
we see is in fact a combination of the two atmospheres.
We do not need to distinguish the two options anymore
because they are simultaneously present in the Stokes
proﬁles.

All calculations are done with Hazel2 (HAnle and
ZEeman Light, Asensio Ramos et al. 2008), which is able
to synthesize the He I 10830˚A multiplet taking into ac-
count the presence of atomic level polarization and the
combined inﬂuence of the Zeeman and Hanle eﬀects. The
radiative transfer is carried out using a very simple slab
model at a ﬁxed height that assumes that all physical
properties are constant within the slab. We use in this
work the option of the code of two diﬀerent slabs, so that
the emergent Stokes parameters are computed using Eqs.
1. Each slab is permeated with a diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld
vector but the pumping radiation in the two slabs is the
same. This simpliﬁcation is probably not very realistic
but this model suﬃces to make our point (see Appendix
for more details).

To prove our idea, we synthesize the Stokes proﬁles us-
ing the parameters of one of the pixels along the ﬁlament
displayed in Fig. 2 of Kuckein et al. (2010). The selected
magnetic ﬁeld has a strength of B = 550 G, an inclination

of θB = 95◦, and an azimuth of φB = 49◦, both angles de-
ﬁned in the local reference system (the quantization axis
being the local vertical). Since the geometry of the ﬁeld
was provided in the observer’s reference frame, we have
transformed them to the local reference system taking
into account that the heliocentric angle of their observa-
tions was θ = 23◦ (µ = cos θ = 0.92). Following Kuckein
et al. (2009), our synthetic proﬁle is obtained by artiﬁ-
cially reducing the anisotropy of the radiation ﬁeld by a
factor 0.2. We apply this correction to the radiation ﬁeld
anisotropy computed in Hazel, which is obtained from
the solar center-to-limb variation of the continuum at
nearby wavelengths and correcting from the geometrical
factor due to the height of the ﬁlament. The synthe-
sized Stokes proﬁles are displayed in Fig. 1 with dashed
black lines and are very similar to those published by
Kuckein et al. (2009). We note that these proﬁles are al-
most indistinguishable from a scenario in which the pres-
ence of atomic level polarization is neglected. The grey
lines show how the proﬁle would look like using the very
same physical properties but fully taking into account
atomic level polarization (i.e., using the radiation ﬁeld
anisotropy computed by Hazel). As already pointed
out by Trujillo Bueno & Asensio Ramos (2007), clear
signatures of atomic level polarization are seen even at
ﬁelds above 1 kG, especially in the red component of the
multiplet.

φ1 = 48◦, and τ1 = 0.6. The upper component has
B2 = 10 G, θ2 = 85◦, φ2 = 140◦, and τ2 = 0.3. The ﬁt
is almost indistinguishable from the proﬁle with reduced
anisotropy. Our inversion indicates that the magnetic
ﬁeld of the low-lying component increases with respect
to the single-component inversion but its geometry is not
modiﬁed much because the Stokes Q, U and V signals
are very strong. The magnetic ﬁeld in the upper slab
turns out to be almost horizontal, with an azimuth that
is roughly perpendicular to that of the lower component
and to the axis of the ﬁlament. We have carried out ex-
tensive tests that indicate that the presence of a weak
ﬁeld in the ﬁlament is a robust result. We stress the
fact that the low-lying component has to have a stronger
magnetic ﬁeld. Otherwise, the proﬁles cannot be ﬁtted.
The magnetic conﬁguration as well as the remaining slab
properties were retrieved without imposing such a con-
ﬁguration as starting point of the inversion.

The proﬁles of the two-component model can be un-
derstood by noting that the scattering polarization sig-
natures generated in each individual component have op-
posite signs because the azimuths of the ﬁelds diﬀer by
∼ 90◦. The solution of the radiative transfer equation
combines them reducing the Hanle contribution, with the
possibility of even fully cancelling it out. We point out
that the Hanle contribution to the line proﬁle of both
components is similar even though the ﬁelds diﬀer by
more than an order of magnitude because the He I 10830
˚A is already in the Hanle saturation regime for ﬁelds
above ∼ 10 − 50 G. In this regime, the Hanle signals are
insensitive to the magnetic ﬁeld strength, so B2 can be
in this range.

We carry out an inversion with Hazel of the dashed
black proﬁles shown in Fig. 1 with a two-component
model. The resulting Stokes parameters are displayed
as solid blue lines in Fig. 1. The inferred values for
the low-lying component are B1 = 650 G, θ1 = 92◦,

3. STABILITY OF THE SOLUTION

It is obvious that the proposed model presents a handi-
cap because a two-component model has a larger number
of parameters and the inversion becomes highly degener-
ate. For instance, Hazel has some problems converging
to the same model when starting from diﬀerent initial
positions in the parameter space. One of the most obvi-
ous degeneracies takes place on the optical depth of each
slab. We can only safely obtain the total optical depth
τ = τ1 + τ2 and the optical depth of each slab remains
undetermined provided their sum equals τ . This aﬀects
the inference of the magnetic ﬁeld because it is sensi-
tive to the speciﬁc value of the optical depth. The only
sensible way that we can think of to overcome this de-
generate problem is to use context information and take
advantage of the whole observed map to introduce con-
straints (e.g., use extrapolations from the photosphere to
the chromosphere).

In spite of the increase in the complexity of the model,
we honestly think that the model proposed in this pa-
per is more physically realistic than any other single-
component model used in the past. Considering the in-
creased degeneracy, it is very important to verify the
consistency of the model and check that the space of pa-
rameters that is compatible with the observations is not
exponentially small. This would give us the idea that
our ﬁt is just a coincidence. To this end, we slightly per-
turb the original proﬁle and inspect whether the inferred
parameters do not vary much. The perturbed Stokes pro-
ﬁles are obtained by changing the magnetic ﬁeld vector
but keeping ﬁxed the thermodynamic and dynamic prop-
erties of the single slab. We consider relative changes of
2, 5 and 10% for the three spherical components of the
magnetic ﬁeld vector. After that, we carry out an inver-
sion with Hazel and calculate the relative change in the
2-component model parameters with respect to the initial
conﬁguration. The results are shown in Table 1. The ta-
ble indicates the relative change in the magnetic ﬁelds of
the upper and lower components when the magnetic ﬁeld
vector in the single-component is modiﬁed with a certain
relative change. All horizontal lines refer to changes be-
low 0.5%, that is compatible with no change at all. We
note that all changes are roughly of the same order than
the modiﬁcation in the original proﬁle. Obviously, larger
modiﬁcations of the proﬁle lead to larger modiﬁcations
of the 2-component model parameters. The important
point of this table is that our proposed model is very ro-
bust to changes in the proﬁle. Of special relevance is the
fact that the azimuth diﬀerence between the two compo-
nents is always ∼ 90◦ for each perturbation. Converging
to the solution with a two-component model is tougher
and slower. For that reason, some values of the Table 1
are obtained by setting the initial values to the original
ones.

4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a natural way to explain the ab-
sence of atomic level polarization signatures in some ob-
served AR ﬁlaments. This absence was interpreted in
the past as an indication that the magnetic ﬁeld in AR
ﬁlaments was very large, well above 500 G. Additionally,
an extra mechanism had to be invoked to destroy the,
otherwise present for these ﬁelds, signatures of atomic

polarization and the Hanle eﬀect.

We propose a two-component model, one on top of the
other3. At certain conﬁguration of the magnetic ﬁeld in
the two components, the scattering polarization and the
Hanle eﬀect signals can cancel out. Therefore, we do not
need any additional mechanism to reduce the anisotropy.
To show this idea, we inverted a synthetic proﬁle com-
puted from the results of Kuckein et al. (2010). We in-
fer a weak magnetic ﬁeld (around tens of G) in the top
component, and a strong hG ﬁeld in the bottom one.
Both are horizontal but have an azimuth diﬀerence of
around 90◦. A ﬁlament harboring weak ﬁelds suspended
above an active chromosphere is then a plausible sce-
nario. Other compatible scenario is associating the lower
part to the ﬁlament over the PIL, under overarching
loops (upper component more tenuous) with perpendicu-
lar ﬁelds to the ﬁrst one. However, the magnetic skeleton
of the ﬂux rope-like ﬁlament observed by Kuckein et al.
(2009) can also reach low chromospheric layers (Yelles
Chaouche et al. 2012).
In this case, our model would
suggest that the ﬁlament has strong ﬁelds in its lower
layers and weak ﬁelds in the upper ones. In this case,
using the magnetic topology inferred by Yelles Chaouche
et al. (2012), the ensuing vertical magnetic ﬁeld strength
gradient would be larger than 500 G/Mm.
The key aspect of the solution found is the 90◦ dif-
ference in azimuth between the top and bottom slabs.
This extreme misalingment between the azimuths of both
components is freely retrieved from the inversion since
the proﬁles show no evidence of atomic polarization.

After an exhaustive search, we were unable to ﬁnd a so-
lution where the two components have similar magnetic
ﬁeld inclinations but a diﬀerence in azimuth signiﬁcantly
smaller than 90◦. We note that forcing more similar az-
imuths in the two components (∼ 30◦) unavoidably leads
to putting the magnetic ﬁeld of the upper component
roughly vertical (∼ 150◦), which is not favored by theo-
retical models. However, the quality of the ﬁt in this case
is much worse, only compatible with the observations at
the level of 10−3.

In our opinion, two factors can contribute to the ex-
planation of why sometimes Hanle-dominated signals
are found while Zeeman-dominated proﬁles are found in
other cases. First, the ﬁlament in Kuckein et al. (2009)
goes above penumbral regions of the active region, so
that the ﬁeld in the lower chromosphere turns out to be

3 Two atmospheres combined with a ﬁlling factor could also be
an option but this physical conﬁguration still has to be justiﬁed,
like other potential scenarios as the one presented by Trujillo Bueno
(2010).

much higher. On the contrary, in our observations, the
ﬁlament is above the granulation, so that the ﬁeld and
the absorption in the chromosphere are smaller. Second,
there is a dependence of the emergent proﬁles on the
optical depth of the ﬁlament.

Finally, we note that inferring the magnetic ﬁeld prop-
erties of ﬁlaments under this model will be more compli-
cated because of the potential ambiguities. More work
needs to be done in order to improve the inversions, pos-
sibly using the full ﬁeld-of-view to constrain the model
parameters. However, we can safely say that a single-
component inversion correctly retrieves: the total optical
depth of the plasma in the ﬁlament (the diﬃcult part is
to separate it into two contributions) and the magnetic
ﬁeld of the dominant component (in our case, the lower
component).

APROXIMATIONS IN THE RADIATIVE TRANSFER PROBLEM

APPENDIX

In order to solve the radiative transfer problem we are assuming that the tensor components of the radiation ﬁeld J 0
0
(mean intensity) and J 2
0 (radiation anisotropy) that illuminate the top component are the same as those illuminating
the lower component. This is a necessary simpliﬁcation in Hazel to solve a linear problem in the statistical equilibrium
equations. Otherwise, the full non-LTE problem of the second kind has to be solved, something that is well beyond
our aims. However, in the following, we estimate the possible impact of the presence of the lower component on the
illumination of the top component.

Concerning the radiation anisotropy of the upper component,(cid:2)J 2

where [φν]2 is the line absorption proﬁle in the upper component and [Iν(µ)]1 is the speciﬁc intensity at frequency ν
and heliocentric angle µ that emerges from the lower component. Let us assume a Gaussian line absorption proﬁle
with line width ∆ν centered at frequency ν0. For simplicity, we assume that the emergent intensity is an absorption
Gaussian line with depression d and that there is no diﬀerential Doppler shift between the two slabs (this case would
generate atomic orientation). Also for simplicity, we assume that only the continuum has center-to-limb variation (d
does not depend on µ). Then, the ratio r between the anisotropy of the upper slab illuminated with and without a
spectral line is given by:

r = 1 − d√
2

.

(A2)
Assuming values of d ∼ 0.25 − 0.4 (this value is diﬃcult to estimate because we only observe the total absorption of
the two components), the ratio yields values r ∼ 0.71 − 0.82. Therefore, the inﬂuence of the presence of an absorption
spectral line on the lower component seems to be negligible, specially given the diﬃculty in solving the full problem.
The second simpliﬁcation in Hazel is that the atomic orientation of the upper slab is zero. However, when the

2, Mart´ınez Gonz´alez et al. (2012) showed that it is possible to generate atomic orientation,
if there is a relative motion between the lower and upper component. The general expression for the orientation of the
radiation ﬁeld is given by:

which, in turn, produces atomic orientation in the top slab.

where Vν(µ) is the emergent Stokes V from the lower component. According to Mart´ınez Gonz´alez et al. (2012), if
the relative velocity between the two components is of the order of 10-12 km s−1, some atomic orientation can be
generated in the upper component. However, this would produce a visible symmetric Stokes V proﬁle, something that
we do not observe.
