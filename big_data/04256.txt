ABSTRACT

Context. Coronal heating is currently thought to proceed via the mechanism of nanoﬂares, small-scale and possibly recurring heating
events that release magnetic energy.
Aims. We investigate the eﬀects of a periodic high-energy electron beam on the synthetic spectra of coronal Fe ions.
Methods. Initially, the coronal plasma is assumed to be Maxwellian with a temperature of 1 MK. The high-energy beam, described
by a κ-distribution, is then switched on every period P for the duration of P/2. The periods are on the order of several tens of seconds,
similar to exposure times or cadences of space-borne spectrometers. Ionization, recombination, and excitation rates for the respective
distributions are used to calculate the resulting non-equilibrium ionization state of Fe and the instantaneous and period-averaged
synthetic spectra.
Results.Under the presence of the periodic electron beam, the plasma is out of ionization equilibrium at all times. The resulting spec-
tra averaged over one period are almost always multithermal if interpreted in terms of ionization equilibrium for either a Maxwellian
or a κ-distribution. Exceptions occur, however; the EM-loci curves appear to have a nearly isothermal crossing-point for some values
of κs. The instantaneous spectra show fast changes in intensities of some lines, especially those formed outside of the peak of the
respective EM(T ) distributions if the ionization equilibrium is assumed.

1. Introduction

The solar corona, the upper atmosphere of the Sun, has tem-
peratures of up to several million Kelvin. Its radiation is
characterized by a large number of emission lines originat-
ing from multiply ionized metal ions, such as Fe, Ca, and
Si (e.g., Landi et al. 2002; Curdt et al. 2004; Landi & Young
2009). This emission typically comes from coronal
loops
and unresolved background located within active regions (see,
e.g., Del Zanna & Mason 2003; Cirtain 2005; Young et al.
2009, 2012; Tripathi et al. 2009; Schmelz et al. 2009, 2011;
Warren et al. 2012; Ugarte-Urra & Warren 2012; Teriaca et al.
2012; Del Zanna 2013b; Subramanian et al. 2014; Gupta et al.
2015, for recent observations).

It

i.e.,

is currently thought that

the active region corona is
heated by nanoﬂares,
impulsive and possibly recur-
ring processes of unknown origin releasing small quanti-
ties of magnetic energy (e.g., Parker 1988; Cargill 1994;
Cargill & Klimchuk 2004; Cargill 2014; Klimchuk 2006;
Klimchuk et al. 2010; Tripathi et al. 2010; Warren et al. 2011;
Viall & Klimchuk
2012;
Reep et al. 2013; Winebarger et al. 2013; Testa et al. 2013;
Klimchuk 2015). It has been recognized that such impulsive
energy releases could occur on timescales shorter than the
ionization equilibration timescales (e.g., Bradshaw & Mason
2003b; Bradshaw & Cargill 2006; Reale & Orlando 2008;
Smith & Hughes 2010; Bradshaw & Klimchuk 2011), leading
to signiﬁcant departures of the ion composition of the plasma

from its equilibrium value for the given local electron tem-
perature. This non-equilibrium ionization must then be taken
into account when modeling the solar corona and the arising
spectra (see, e.g., Bradshaw & Mason 2003a; Bradshaw 2009;
Olluri et al. 2013b,a, 2015).

The presence of

the non-equilibrium ionization, how-
ever, may not be the only diﬃculty connected to the impul-
sive energy release in nanoﬂares. Accelerated particles may
be present as well, especially if the nanoﬂares happen via
magnetic reconnection (e.g., Fletcher et al. 2011; Cargill et al.
2012; Gontikakis et al. 2013; Gordovskyy et al. 2013, 2014;
Burge et al. 2014), wave-particle interactions (Vocks et al. 2008;
Che & Goldstein 2014), or turbulence with a diﬀusion coeﬃ-
cient inversely proportional to velocity (Hasegawa et al. 1985;
Laming & Lepri 2007; Bian et al. 2014). The presence of ener-
getic particles have been indirectly detected using analyses of
emission lines originating in active regions (Dzifˇcáková et al.
2011; Testa et al. 2014; Dudík et al. 2015).

Nevertheless, the current analyses of coronal spectra are sub-
ject to various diﬃculties and uncertainties involved and there-
fore the departures from equilibrium are still largely ignored.
This paper presents an exploratory study of the combined ef-
fects of energetic particles and the non-equilibrium ionization
on the coronal spectra. A simple model of a periodic electron
beam is assumed in Sect. 2. The resulting behavior of the non-
equilibrium plasma is described in Sect. 3, while the conse-
quences for interpretation of observed spectra are given in Sect.
4. A summary is presented in Sect. 5.

ered in the model. The Maxwellian distribu-

that these Tκ values are higher than the Maxwellian T , since the
switch-on of the electron beam eﬀectively adds energetic parti-
cles to the emitting plasma considered. The κ-distributions with
κ = 5 and 2 adds 19% and 56% particles, respectively (see Eq.
3). Most of these particles are added at energies of several keV
or below (see Fig. 1), i.e., at energies undetectable by RHESSI
(cf., Hannah et al. 2010).

We note that we do not consider the evolution of the dis-
tribution function because of the collisions of the high-energy
electrons with the ambient Maxwellian. This is of course only
a crude approximation that is analogous to assuming that the
κ-distribution is being generated for the duration of P/2 some-
where else along the emitting loop, passes through the plasma
whose radiation is being investigated, exits the region of inter-
est after P/2, and is thermalized in the chromosphere. Our aim is
only to explore the possible eﬀects of periodic electron beams on
the coronal spectra without constructing a too speciﬁc coronal
loop model including geometry, hydrodynamic evolution, and
details of particle acceleration and interaction.

2. Method

2.1. Periodicelectronbeam

We consider a simple model where an electron beam pass-
ing through the plasma is periodically “switched on” and then
“switched oﬀ” with a ﬁxed period P. Initially, and when
the beam is switched oﬀ, the plasma is assumed to have a
Maxwellian distribution with a temperature T = 1 MK. This
temperature is chosen arbitrarily to represent, for example,
a typical
loop as derived
from observations (e.g., Del Zanna & Mason 2003; Del Zanna
2013b; Warren & Winebarger 2003; Winebarger et al. 2003;
Aschwanden & Nightingale 2005; Aschwanden et al. 2008;
Schmelz et al. 2009, 2011; Landi & Young 2010; Brooks et al.
2011, 2012).

temperature of a warm coronal

At time t = 0, the electron beam is switched on for the dura-
tion of a half-period P/2. The electron beam is represented by
power-law high-energy tail described by a κ-distribution (e.g.,
Vasyliunas 1968; Owocki & Scudder 1983; Dzifˇcáková et al.
2015)

where Aκ is a normalization constant, kB is the Boltzmann con-
stant, Cκ is a multiplication constant determined by matching the
peak of the κ-distribution to the peak of the Maxwellian (Fig. 1),
and Tκ is the temperature of the κ-distribution that is in principle
diﬀerent from the chosen T = 1 MK for the Maxwellian distribu-
tion. The slope of the power-law tail of the κ-distribution is given
by κ + 1/2.

The choice of a κ-distribution to describe the power-law
high-energy tail is made because the κ-distribution is a distribu-
tion with a Maxwellian-like bulk (Oka et al. 2013) and a strong
high-energy tail while still being continuous and described by
only one extra free parameter, κ. The values of Cκ and Tκ are
then dependent on the value of κ chosen, with

(cf., Oka et al. 2013). For κ = 2, the temperature Tκ is 4 MK,

2.2. Non-equilibriumionizationandtheeffectivetemperature

At t = 0, the plasma is assumed to be in collisional ionization
equilibrium corresponding to the Maxwellian with T = 1 MK.
The corresponding relative ion abundances and the ionization
and recombination cross-sections are given by the atomic data
present in the CHIANTI database, version 7.1 (Dere et al. 1997;
Dere 2007; Landi et al. 2013). At t = 0, the beam is switched
on, resulting in a change of the electron distribution including
T → Tκ, with the ionization and recombination rates changing
correspondingly. If the period P is less than the ionization equi-
libration timescale (e.g., Golub et al. 1989; Reale & Orlando
2008; Smith & Hughes 2010), the plasma is no longer in ion-
ization equilibrium. These equilibration timescales are typically
tens or hundreds of seconds, depending on the temperature,
density, and element considered (see Fig. 1 in Smith & Hughes
2010).

The ionization and recombination processes considered in-
clude the direct impact ionization, autoionization, and radia-
tive and dielectronic recombination. For the Maxwellian distri-
bution, these rates are obtained from the CHIANTI database,
while for
the κ-distributions the rates were obtained by
Dzifˇcáková & Dudík (2013).

We note that the electron density ne is not constant through-
out the period P. In the ﬁrst half-period, where the distribution is
a κ-distribution, the ne is Cκ-times higher than during the second,
Maxwellian half-period because the change of the distribution to
a κ-one eﬀectively adds particles (Fig. 1). The ﬁrst-order diﬀer-
ential equation (4) is then solved using the Runge-Kutta method
with a suﬃciently small time step ensuring the stability of the

step.

solution and the condition thatPi Yi = 1 is fulﬁlled at every time

To describe the non-equilibrium ionization state, we used the
eﬀective ionization temperature. In ionization equilibrium, the
mean charge state of an element is a monotonically increasing
function of electron temperature. The shape of the curve de-
pends on κ; an example for iron is shown in Fig. 2. For κ = 2
and log(T /K) . 6.2, it is shallower than for the Maxwellian dis-
tribution. This is a consequence of the shift of the equilibrium
relative ion abundances of Fe towards lower T for low values
of κ (Dzifˇcáková & Dudík 2013). At higher temperatures, the
curve is similar to the one for the Maxwellian distribution, but
is shifted towards higher T for low values of κ, again a conse-
quence of the behavior of the ionization equilibrium with κ.

eﬀ

The monotonic nature of these curves permits us to deﬁne the
eﬀective temperatures T κ=const.
for a respective κ-distribution. We
deﬁne it as the temperature corresponding to a particular mean
charge of an element if interpreted in terms of ionization equi-
librium for a given value of κ. We note that in ionization equilib-
rium, the eﬀective ionization temperature is by deﬁnition equal
to the electron temperature if a correct value of κ is used.

In the remainder of this work, we study the non-equilibrium
ionization of iron under a periodic electron beam (Sect. 3). The

Teﬀ is calculated from the mean Fe charge in the non-equilibrium
ionization state under the assumption that the plasma is ei-
ther Maxwellian or non-Maxwellian with a constant value of κ,
as done when interpreting the coronal observations (see, e.g.,
Dudík et al. 2015).

2.3. Synthesisofcoronalspectra

Once the relative ion abundances Yi are obtained, we calculate
the synthetic Fe viii–Fe xvii line spectra at wavelengths of 170–
290 Å, similar to the wavelength range observed by the Extreme-
ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS, Culhane et al. 2007) on-
board the Hinode satellite (Kosugi et al. 2007). The emissivities
εi, jk of the Fe lines arising due to the transition j → k in the ion
Yi in the optically thin coronal conditions are given by (e.g.,
Mason & Mosignori-Fossi 1994; Phillips et al. 2008)

where λ jk is the wavelength of the transition, h is the Planck con-
stant, c is the speed of light, nH is the hydrogen number density,
n j is the number density of the i-times ionized Fe ion with the
electron on the excited upper level j, ni = YinFe and AFe = nFe/nH
is the iron abundance relative to hydrogen, and Gi, jk(T, ne, κ)
is the line contribution function. The Einstein’s coeﬃcients
A jk for the spontaneous radiative transition are taken from the
CHIANTI database, version 7.1 (Dere et al. 1997; Landi et al.
2013), as are the collisional excitation and deexcitation rates
for the Maxwellian distribution. For the κ-distributions, these
collisonal excitation and deexcitation rates are obtained using
the approximative method implemented in the KAPPA database
(Dzifˇcáková et al. 2015). It was shown therein that the relative
accuracy of the rates obtained using this approximative method
are typically higher than 5% when compared to the rates ob-
tained by direct calculations from the respective cross-sections
(Dudík et al. 2014b). We note however that some of the excita-
tion rates have been recently updated in the version 8 of the CHI-
ANTI database (Del Zanna et al. 2015). The inﬂuence of these
new atomic data on the resulting spectra is discussed in Ap-
pendix A. Finally, we adopted the “coronal” value of AFe based
on the abundance measurements of Feldman et al. (1992).

The corresponding line intensities Ii, jk are then obtained by

using the formula

Ii, jk = AFeZl

Gi, jk(T, ne, κ)nenHdl ,

(6)

where l is the observer’s line of sight through the optically thin
corona. We note that this equation is commonly recast as

Ii, jk = AFeZT

Gi, jk(T, ne, κ)DEMκ(T )dT

(7)

for the purpose of intepretation of observations. Here, the quan-
tity DEMκ(T ) = nenHdl/dT is the diﬀerential emission mea-
sure (see, e.g., chapter 4.6 in Phillips et al. 2008), generalized
for the κ-distributions by Mackovjak et al. (2014). The corre-
sponding emission measure EMκ(T ) is then simply given as
EMκ(T ) = DEMκ(T )dT .

3. Results

3.1. Resultsforstrongbeam

To explore the consequences of a periodic high-energy elec-
tron beam, we studied several cases described by their re-
spective free parameters. First, we chose the electron density

value pertains to the half-period during which the distribution is
a κ-distribution. Next, we selected κ = 2, which is the most ex-
treme non-Maxwellian value for which the spectra can be syn-

thesized using the KAPPA package (Dzifˇcáková et al. 2015). Fi-
nally, we chose periods on the order of several tens of seconds to
be comparable with the typical exposure times and/or cadence of
the EUV coronal spectrometers such as Hinode/EIS (except per-
haps for observations of brightest lines, see Culhane et al. 2007)
or imagers such as SDO/AIA (Lemen et al. 2012; Boerner et al.
2012). We note that such periods are also of the same or-
der of magnitude as the durations of individual nanoﬂare heat-
ing events (e.g., Bradshaw & Mason 2003b; Bradshaw & Cargill
2006; Taroyan et al. 2006, 2011; Reale & Orlando 2008;
Bradshaw 2009; Bradshaw & Klimchuk 2011; Bradshaw et al.
2012; Reep et al. 2013; Klimchuk & Bradshaw 2014; Price et al.
2015).

Figure 3 shows the results for P = 10, 20, and 60 s. Although
these values are arbitrary, they are suﬃcient to capture the typ-
ical eﬀects of the periodic electron beam on the spectra. In this
ﬁgure, the left panel shows the stepwise evolution of the distri-
bution function together with the eﬀective ionization tempera-
tures calculated under the assumption of a κ = 2 distribution and
a Maxwellian distribution. The middle and right panels show the
corresponding spectra averaged over the ﬁrst and ﬁfth period, re-
spectively. The respective instantaneous spectra at each time step
are shown as animations in Movies 1-3.

For the shortest period of 10 s, we ﬁnd that the P is short
enough for the plasma to be out of ionization equilibrium and
that it undergoes ionization pumping. This means that during the
ﬁrst half-period P/2, when the beam is switched on, the eﬀective
ionization temperatures calculated for κ = 2 and the Maxwellian
distribution both spike from the initial value of T = 1 MK and
reach log(T κ=2
[K])≈ 6.17 (Fig. 3,
eﬀ
top left, and Movie 1). This is followed by a small drop in the
second-half period during which the beam is switched oﬀ and
the distribution is Maxwellian. In the subsequent periods, the ef-
fective ionization temperature continues to rise at a slowing rate
until it reaches the maximum values of log(T κ=2
eﬀ [K])≈ 6.45 and
log(T Mxw
[K])≈ 6.3. There are, however, small saw-like varia-
tions in Teﬀ due to the periodic switching on and oﬀ of the beam,
so that the plasma is never in ionization equilibrium.

[K])≈ 6.35 and log(T Mxw

eﬀ

eﬀ

The corresponding spectra averaged over the ﬁrst and ﬁfth
periods are shown in the top row of Fig. 3. During the ﬁrst pe-
riod, the average spectrum (black) is dominated by the strong
Fe ix–Fe xii lines at 171–195 Å; the Fe xi 180.40 Å line is the
strongest one. The higher temperature lines are much weaker,
having less than 20% in terms of intensity than the strongest
Fe xi line. The Fe xv 284.16 Å line is very weak, having less than
about 5% relative intensity. These intensities are not surprising

given the values of Teﬀ during the ﬁrst period, since this quantity
is based on the mean ion charge (see Sect. 2.2).

In contrast, the average spectrum for the ﬁfth period is sig-
niﬁcantly diﬀerent. We note that the ﬁfth period is chosen as a
representative one and has an average log(Teﬀ [K]), which is not
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the near stationary behavior of the
ionization composition, which is lower by less than 0.05 dex.
The period-averaged spectrum is now dominated by the Fe xi–
Fe xv lines (Fig. 3 top right). The Fe xi 180.40 Å line is still the
dominant one, but the intensities of lines belonging to the higher
ionization stages have increased signiﬁcantly, while the Fe ix and
Fe x lines have decreased. In particular, the relative intensity of
the Fe xv 284.16 Å line is now 0.7. The instantaneous spectra
(Movie 1) show fast, subsecond changes especially in the Fe ix
171.07 Å and Fe xv 284.16 Å lines during the ﬁrst period. These
changes are slower during the subsequent periods, when the in-
tensity of Fe xv 284.16 Å line increases.

eﬀ

For P = 20 s, the situation is similar to that of P = 10 s dis-
cussed previously, except that the eﬀect of ionization pumping
is now weaker. The log(T κ=2
eﬀ ) [K]) reaches a maximum of ≈6.4
during the ﬁrst period and 6.45 during the ﬁfth period, while
the maxima of the log(T Mxw
) [K])≈ 6.23 and 6.3 for the ﬁrst
and ﬁfth period, respectively. The intensities of the Fe xiii–Fe xv
lines increase with respect to the P = 10 s case, with the Fe xv
284.16 Å line having almost 1.0 relative intensity during the ﬁfth
period. The instantaneous spectra show a fast decrease in the
Fe ix 171.07 Å line during the ﬁrst 5 seconds, followed by the ap-
pearance of the Fe xv line. The intensity of this line increases on
average from the ﬁrst half-period, and decreases when the distri-
bution is Maxwellian. In the second and subsequent periods the
line remains visible, as can be expected from the behavior of the
Teﬀ.

eﬀ

The P = 60 s period case exhibits a fast increase in Teﬀ dur-
eﬀ [K]) of about 6.45 and log(T Mxw
ing the ﬁrst period to log(T κ=2
[K])≈ 6.3, followed by a decrease of about 0.1 dex during the
second half-period. In the next periods, the eﬀective tempera-
tures increase to similar maximum values and an oscillatory state
is reached within the second period. The averaged spectra are
now dominated by the Fe xv 284.16 Å line, with the intensities
of lower ionization stages being weaker during the ﬁfth period
than during the ﬁrst period (see the bottom row of Fig. 3). The
Fe ix 171.07 Å, Fe xi 180.40 Å, and Fe xii 195.12 Å lines never-
theless remain relatively strong with the relative intensities of
about 0.6.

In the instantaneous spectra, however, the Fe ix–Fe xii lines
are dominant over the ﬁrst 12 seconds. During this time, their in-

tensities decrease, while the intensity of Fe xv increases and is
dominant approximately in the interval of 12–50 s. After the ﬁrst
half-period (30 s), the Fe xv line intensity decreases and the last
10 seconds of the period are again dominated by lower ioniza-
tion stages, in particular Fe ix. These changes reﬂect again the
evolution of Teﬀ.

In all the cases presented here, the Teﬀ is diﬀerent from the
respective Tκ or T , indicating that the plasma is always out of
ionization equilibrium.

4. Consequences for interpretation of observations

In Sect. 3 it was found that all the studied cases are out of ion-
ization equilibrium at all times, and that the respective period-
averaged spectra show the presence of lines from multiple ion-
ization stages. We now focus on the interpretation of such spec-
tra, both in terms of plasma multithermality, i.e., using DEM
techniques, as well as in terms of diagnosing possible departures
from the Maxwellian distribution.

3.2. Higherelectrondensity

To study the inﬂuence of electron density on the evolution, we
present the case of P = 20 s calculated assuming an order of
magnitude higher density of log(ne [cm−3]) = 10. The results are
shown in Fig. 4.

eﬀ

eﬀ [K]) = 6.55 and log(T Mxw

In this case, the maximum Teﬀ reaches higher values during
the ﬁrst period compared to the case with lower density, with
log(T κ=2
[K]) = 6.40. In particular, the
value of T κ=2
eﬀ is signiﬁcantly closer to the respective equilibrium
value for the ﬁrst half-period. The enhanced electron density,
however, also leads to enhanced recombination. The recombi-
nation, dominant in the second half-period, causes a larger drop
in Teﬀ, of about 0.15 dex, than in the case with lower density.
In the subsequent periods, the maximum values of T κ=2
eﬀ increase
slightly owing to the weak ionization pumping, but never reach
the respective equilibrium value (left panel in Fig. 4).

The average spectra are dominated by Fe xv, in agreement
with the values of Teﬀ, but show signiﬁcant Fe ix 171.07 Å inten-
sities as well. The intensity of this Fe ix spikes and becomes tem-
porarily dominant in the second half-period for the last 6 seconds
owing to the enhanced recombination.

Increasing the density by another order of magnitude to
1011 cm−3 would cause the T κ=2
to temporarily reach its equi-
eﬀ
librium value of 4 MK for nearly the entire second quarter of
a period, while the T Mxw
eﬀ would approach its equilibrium value
of 1 MK towards the end of the ﬁrst period. This means that a
suﬃcient increase in electron density would lead to the plasma
being in ionization equilibrium for a non-negligible portion of
the half-period, characterized by its respective distribution.

3.3. Aweakerbeam

To study the eﬀects of weaker beam, we selected κ = 5, which
is an intermediate value of κ in terms of the inﬂuence of sta-
tionary κ-distributions on spectra (Dzifˇcáková & Dudík 2013;
Dudík et al. 2014a,b). The other parameters are set
to be
log(ne [cm−3]) = 9 and P = 20 s.

Owing to the lower number of high-energy particles in a κ = 5
distribution, the Teﬀ does not attain values larger than 6.12 in the
log. The values of T κ=5
are only marginally diﬀerent,
which is likely due to the behavior of the ionization equilibrium
(Dzifˇcáková & Dudík 2013) and thus the mean ion charge used
to deﬁne the Teﬀ. The averaged spectra are dominated by the
Fe ix line; the Fe xiii–Fe xv lines are strongly suppressed corre-
sponding to the relatively low values of Teﬀ. The spectra of the
ﬁrst and ﬁfth period are similar, which is expected given the ab-
sence of a strong ionization pumping. In the instantaneous spec-
tra (Movie 5), the Fe ix 171.07 Å line intensity oscillates by more
than a factor of two, while the intensity of the Fe x 174.53 Å line
exhibits much weaker changes on the order of 20%.

4.1. Multithermality

We ﬁrst used the period-averaged synthetic intensities to cal-
culate the respective DEMs as a function of κs. Here, we use
κs to denote to a stationary κ-distribution, i.e., a distribution of
electron energies with a constant value of κs, assumed by the
prospective observer in analysis of the spectra. This analysis
was used by Mackovjak et al. (2014) on the spectra of active re-
gion cores and quiet Sun presented by Warren et al. (2012) and
Landi & Young (2010), respectively. Mackovjak et al. (2014)
found that the slopes of the EM(T ) for the multithermal active
region cores did not change with κs, while the quiet Sun spectra
were multithermal with a decreasing degree of multithermality
with decreasing κs.

In Figs. 6 and 7, we present the EM(T ) distributions cal-
culated using the synthetic intensities from the synthetic spec-
tra presented in Fig. 3, i.e., a periodic beam with κ = 2 and
log(ne [cm−3]) = 9. The EM(T ) distributions presented in Fig.
6 correspond to the intensities averaged over the ﬁrst period,
reﬂecting the case of a single pulse, while those in Fig. 7 cor-
respond to the intensities averaged over the ﬁfth period, rep-
resenting a near-stationary oscillatory state. The EM(T ) distri-
butions shown in Figs. 6 and 7 were obtained from the respec-
tive DEM(T ) calculated using the regularized inversion method
of Hannah & Kontar (2012) under the assumption of a constant
κs value. We note that the κs inﬂuences the line contribution
functions, which are calculated using the method described in
Dzifˇcáková et al. (2015) under the assumption of the ionization
equlibrium. The values of κs used for the construction of these
EM(T ) distributions are κs = 2 (left column), 5 (middle), and ∞,
i.e., a Maxwellian distribution (right column).
We ﬁnd that for nearly all the cases presented in Figs. 6
and 7, the plasma is multithermal. The low-temperature and
high-temperature slopes, α and β, respectively, are indicated
in each panel of Figs. 6 and 7. These slopes and their re-
spective errors are obtained by linear least-square ﬁtting of the
log(EM) as a function of log(T [K]). For P = 10, the EM(T )
distributions are near-isothermal (cf., Warren et al. 2014, Fig. 4
therein), with α being higher than 7.2 independently of κs. How-
ever, for κs = 5 and the ﬁrst period, the EM-loci curves (see,
e.g., Strong 1978; Veck et al. 1984; Del Zanna & Mason 2003)
have an almost isothermal crossing point at EM≈ 6 ×1026 cm−5
and log(T [K])≈ 6.15. The corresponding spectrum can then be
interpreted, within the limit of observational uncertainties, as
isothermal for κs = 5, even though the spectrum originates in an
out-of-equilibrium plasma heated by an electron beam.

A similar situation arises for the P = 10 s and the ﬁfth pe-
riod (Fig. 7, top); however, the EM-loci curves now indicate
a near-isothermal plasma for κs = 2, with the crossing point
at EM≈ 7 ×1026 cm−5 and log(T [K])≈ 6.40. If this spectrum
were interpreted as arising in a Maxwellian plasma, as is com-
monly done, the EM-loci curves would indicate a multithermal
plasma with EM(T ) somewhat similar to that of the quiet Sun
(Landi & Young 2010; Mackovjak et al. 2014).

Dzifˇcáková et al.: Non-equilibrium ionization by a periodic electron beam

Fig. 6. Emission measure distributions EM(T ) derived under the assumption of a constant κs using the intensities averaged over the ﬁrst period for
P = 10 s (top), 20 s (middle), and 60 s (bottom). The spectra correspond to log(ne [cm−3]) = 9. Low-T and high-T power-law slopes of the EM(T )
functions are denoted α and β, respectively.

With increasing P, the spectra become progressively more
multithermal, and the value of α decreases with increasing P.
Furthermore, the spectra averaged over the ﬁfth period are more
multithermal than the spectra averaged over the ﬁrst period. For
P = 60 s and κs corresponding to the Maxwellian distribution, we
ﬁnd α ≈ 3.5 with a somewhat higher value for lower κs. These
EM(T ) distributions are similar to those reported for coronal
loops (see, e.g., Del Zanna & Mason 2003; Brooks et al. 2011,
2012; Schmelz et al. 2009, 2013b,a, 2014; Subramanian et al.
2014; Dudík et al. 2015), although some of these were de-
rived using diﬀerent observed lines or diﬀerent DEM methods,
which makes the direct comparison diﬃcult. Nevertheless, it is
not the purpose of this paper to directly model the observed
EM(T ) distributions; rather, we emphasize the ﬁnding that out-
of-equilibrium plasma will nearly always resemble multithermal
plasma. This is especially true if the periodic electron beam,
or other agent causing the departures from equilibrium ioniza-
tion, occurs on periods shorter than or comparable to that of
the typical integration times of EUV spectrometers such as Hin-
ode/EIS. Finally, we note that the multithermal representation
of the period-averaged synthetic spectra is made possible by the
changes in the ionization state of the plasma, and that diﬀerent
excitation datasets have only a small eﬀect on the resulting EM-
loci and DEMs (see Appendix A).

4.2. Diagnosticsofastationary κ-distribution

We next attempted to diagnose the κs from the period-averaged
spectra using the method presented in Dudík et al. (2015). There,
the observed Hinode/EIS spectra of a transient coronal loop were
interpreted in terms of a stationary κ-distribution with a constant
value of κs. It was found that the loop is consistent with a very
low value of κs . 2. This diagnostics was performed using the
ratio-ratio technique, where two line ratios are combined to si-
multaneously diagnose the temperature Tκ and the value of κ.
Simultaneous diagnostics is necessary since Tκ and κ are both
parameters of the distribution (Eq. 1). The line ratios used by
Dudík et al. (2015) involved one ratio from ions in the neigh-
boring ionization stages, Fe xi and Fe xii, which is sensitive to
κs and strongly sensitive to Tκ. The other line ratio was a ratio
of two Fe xi lines separated in wavelength, one from the short-
wavelength channel of EIS and the other in the long-wavelength
EIS channel. The diﬀerence in excitation energy thresholds of
these two lines causes the ratio to become sensitive to the shape
of the distribution, i.e., to both Tκ and κs.

Here, we use this ratio-ratio technique involving the same
lines as Dudík et al. (2015). In Fig. 8, individual colors are
used to distinguish the dependence of the Fe xii 195.119 Å/ Fe xi
188.216 Å ratio on the Fe xi 188.216 Å / 257.772 Å ratio as a
function of the assumed value of κs. Maxwellian is in black,
while red stands for κs = 2. We see that the individual ratio-ratio
curves as a function of κs are separated and do not cross each

other. Subsequently, the period-averaged intensities were used to
calculate the values of individual line ratios, and the results are
plotted in violet. The errorbars are calculated assuming a 20%
uncertainty in line intensities, a value typical for EIS observa-
tions (Culhane et al. 2007; Del Zanna 2013a).

The ratios with their respective error-bars shown in Fig. 8
correspond to the case with P = 20 s, log(ne [cm−3]) = 9, and the
beam described with κ = 2. We see that the crosses indicate a
moderate value of κs = 5 for the ﬁrst period, and κs = 3 for the
ﬁfth period. Unfortunately, the errorbars, resulting from the use
of a weak Fe xi 257.772 Å line, are too large to unambiguously
diagnose the value of κs. This is the case for all beam parame-
ters investigated in Sect. 3. The only measurable quantity using

Article number, page 8 of 11

the ratio-ratio technique is Tκ, ranging from ≈6.15 to 6.35, with
lower values for the Maxwellian distribution. These values are
slightly lower than the respective Teﬀ (Fig. 3, middle row).

Although the value of κs cannot be diagnosed using the appli-
cation of this technique on the intensities obtained in Sect. 3, this
result implies that the case of κs . 2 diagnosed by Dudík et al.
(2015) likely corresponds to a nearly time-independent κ-
distribution rather than periodic high-energy beam.

5. Summary

We investigated the eﬀect of a periodic, high-energy, power-law,
electron beam on the coronal spectra of Fe. To do this, a sim-

Dzifˇcáková et al.: Non-equilibrium ionization by a periodic electron beam

ple model was employed, assuming that the distribution of elec-
tron energies switches periodically from a Maxwellian to a κ-
distribution and back every half-period P/2. The κ-distribution
was assumed to have nearly the same core and low-energy part
as the Maxwellian distribution with the pre-set temperature of
T = 1 MK. This situation mimics, for example, the behavior of
plasma in a portion of a warm coronal loop being periodically
crossed by an electron beam being generated elsewhere along the
loop, e.g., during periodically recurring nanoﬂare-like events.

We found that the periodic occurrence of the electron beam
drives the plasma out of ionization equilibrium. The studied pe-
riods, P = 10, 20, and 60 s, are on the order of the typical spec-
trometer exposure times or the nanoﬂare duration. For all the
cases studied here, the plasma is out of ionization equilibrium at
all times, unless a suﬃciently high electron density, on the or-
der of 1011 cm−3, is assumed. The presence of the high-energy
beam described by a κ-distribution also leads to an increase in the
eﬀective ionization temperature of the plasma, a quantity calcu-
lated from the mean charge state of the plasma.

The period-averaged and instantaneous spectra were calcu-
lated in order to investigate the possible observables. The instan-
taneous spectra show fast changes in lines of ions that are formed
in equilibrium at temperatures outside of the eﬀective ionization
temperature; in our case these lines were typically those of Fe ix
and Fe xv. The period-averaged spectra, calculated to approx-
imate the observables obtained by a spectrometer with similar
exposure times, were interpreted using the regularized inversion
DEM technique under an assumption of a stationary Maxwellian
or a κ-distribution, as is commonly done for the coronal obser-
vations. It was found that the out-of-equilibrium plasma nearly
always resembles multithermal plasma. However, for some com-
bination of parameters including κs, the EM-loci curves showed
an almost isothermal crossing point, which can be misinterpreted
as an isothermal plasma with a constant value of κs, even though
the periodic occurrence of an electron beam with a κ-distribution
drives the plasma out of ionization equilibrium.

We also attempted to perform a diagnostics of a stationary κ-
distribution from the period-averaged spectra. Moderate depar-
tures from the Maxwellian were found; however, taking the real-
istic observational uncertainties into account can eﬀectively pre-
vent the determination of the κs using the ratio-ratio technique.
This is due to the large error-bars compared to the sensitivity of
the ratio-ratio curves to κs.

In summary, we showed that the periodic presence of en-
ergetic electrons, possibly created during recurring nanoﬂare-
type reconnection events in a given strand in the solar corona,
could be at least a partial explanation for the presence of sin-
gle structures observed in the solar corona that appear multither-
mal even after background subtraction, such as some coronal
loops. It is likely that multithermality also arises owing to the
optically thin nature of the solar corona; however, our results
imply that the eﬀects of energetic particles and the resulting out-
of-equilibrium ionization on the spectra cannot be discounted
when interpreting the coronal spectra and/or modeling the ob-
servables produced by nanoﬂare heating events. Clearly, identi-
fying these non-equilibrium processes – the energetic particles,
the non-equilibrium ionization, and their combination – deserve
further study. In the meantime, we suggest that fast changes in
some of the lines being formed outside of the peak of the respec-
tive emission measure distributions could be a potential observ-
able for the presence of a periodic electron beam. Transition-
region lines, where fast changes in line intensities are often de-
tected (Doyle et al. 2006; Testa et al. 2013; Régnier et al. 2014;

Huang et al. 2014; Vissers et al. 2015), will be the subject of a
following paper.

Appendix A: Inﬂuence of the excitation atomic data

on the resulting period-averaged spectra

Recently, the CHIANTI database underwent a signiﬁcant revi-
sion containing new excitation cross-sections for many of the
coronal Fe ions in the new version 8 (Del Zanna et al. 2015).
Since we use here the atomic data corresponding to the CHI-
ANTI version 7.1, for which the excitation rates are available
in the KAPPA database, we now estimate the inﬂuence of these
new atomic data on the resulting period-averaged spectrum.

The period-averaged intensity DIi, jkE of a particular spectral

line λ jk is given by

where t is time and Iκ=2
are the corresponding time-
dependent intensities during the respective half-periods P/2
where the distribution is a κ = 2 or a Maxwellian, respectively.
Using Eqs. (5)–(6), we get

The expression n j/ni represents the excited fraction of an ion
+i with an electron on the upper level j. These expressions can
be brought before the respective integrals since the excitation
timescales are much shorter than the ionization and recombi-
nation timescales (Phillips et al. 2008), i.e., the level population
adjusts nearly instantaneously to reﬂect the new distributions of
electrons, which is either a Maxwellian or a κ-distribution within
the respective half-periods (see Sect. 2.2). Therefore, the n j/ni
expression is nearly constant throughout each half-period.

Using this result, the ratio of period-averaged intensities cal-
culated using the excitation cross-sections from CHIANTI v8 to
CHIANTI v7.1 are then obtained as

(A.4)

This assumption is justiﬁed if the behavior of the respective col-
lision strengths with incident energy E does not change much be-
tween the two atomic datasets. That this is the case can be seen,
for example, from the fact that the density-sensitive line ratios
do not change substantially for diﬀerent κ or diﬀerent atomic
datasets (see Dudík et al. 2014b), with the exception of Fe xii
(see also Del Zanna et al. 2012).

Finally we note that the EM-loci curves shown in Figs. 6 and
7 will not be aﬀected by the atomic datasets, since the change
in period-averaged intensities in the numerator and contribution
functions in the denominator cancel out under the above men-
tioned assumption.
