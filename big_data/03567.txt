(Dated: March 14, 2016)

We use the voltage biased tip of a scanning force microscope at a temperature of 35 mK to locally
induce the fractional quantum Hall state of ν = 1/3 in a split-gate deﬁned constriction. Diﬀerent tip
positions allow us to vary the potential landscape. From temperature dependence of the conductance
plateau at G = 1/3 × e2/h we determine the activation energy of this local ν = 1/3 state. We ﬁnd
that at a magnetic ﬁeld of 6 T the activation energy is between 153 µeV and 194 µeV independent
of the shape of the conﬁning potential, but about 50% lower than for bulk samples.

I.

INTRODUCTION

At high magnetic ﬁelds, two-dimensional electron sys-
tems display the integer [1] and the fractional [2] quan-
tum Hall (QH) eﬀect. In this regime the current is ex-
pected to be carried by counterpropagating chiral edge
channels which interact only if they are brought in prox-
imity by a quantum point contact (QPC). This interac-
tion could be exploited to check for non-Abelian statistics
using a Fabry-Perot interferometer in the fractional QH
regime [3]. Even though fragile states such as ν = 5/2
have been observed in single constrictions [4–6], only in-
terferometers in the regime of integer and more robust
fractional QH states have been shown [7–10]. Therefore
a deeper understanding of fractional QH states in con-
strictions is required.

For this purpose we form diﬀerent potential landscapes
and measure the activation energy of the fractional QH
state of ν = 1/3 conﬁned between edge channels. We
use a movable ”scanning” gate to tune the potential of a
split-gate deﬁned QPC.

For scanning gate microscopy (SGM) we apply a volt-
age to the conductive tip of a scanning force microscope
to form the movable gate. This technique gives an addi-
tional spatial degree of freedom compared to conventional
top gate-deﬁned structures. SGM has been successfully
used to obtain spatial information about integer and frac-
tional QH edge channels [11–13]. The activation energy
of the fractional QH state ν = 1/3 has been found to
be lower for conﬁned geometries than for bulk samples
[14, 15]. Our measurements conﬁrm this ﬁnding and in-
dicate that the activation energy of a conﬁned fractional
QH state depends only weakly on the exact shape of the
conﬁning potential.

II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

The experiment is performed in a home-built scanning
force microscope in a dilution refrigerator with a base

∗ bbraem@phys.ethz.ch

temperature of 35 mK [16]. Coulomb blockade measure-
ments (data not shown) in this setup showed an electron
temperature of ≈ 200 mK. The scanning force sensor is
a focused-ion-beam sharpened PtIr-wire attached to a
quartz tuning fork [17]. To locate the sample, we use
the tip for topography scanning. During SGM measure-
ments, the tip is retracted and scanned at a constant dis-
tance of 110 nm above the sample surface. It is only ca-
pacitively coupled to the electronic system of the sample
and no current ﬂows from the tip to the sample. The di-
rection of fast tip motion is referred to as the x-direction.
The sample is a 400 µm wide Hall bar etched into
a GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructure with a 310 nm deep
two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). The 2DEG has
an electron density of 9.3 × 1010cm−2 and a mobility
4.7 × 106cm2/Vs at 35 mK. The nanostructure is a split-
gate deﬁned quantum point contact with a lithographic
width of 800 nm as shown in the scanning electron mi-
croscope image in Fig. 1(b).

Figure 1(a) is a schematic of the measurement setup.
The constriction within the 2DEG is deﬁned by ap-
plying a gate voltage Vg = −0.7 V to the top gates
and a local perturbation is created by the dc tip bias
Vtip = −10 V. We determine the four-terminal conduc-
tance G = ISD/VD by applying a voltage VSD between
source and drain of the Hall bar and measuring the
source-drain current ISD and the diagonal voltage VD.
For lock-in measurements an ac excitation is applied,
therefore VSD = VSD−dc +VSD−ac. If not stated explicitly,
VSD−dc = 0 and VSD−ac = 20 µV at 68 Hz.

A magnetic ﬁeld B = 6 T is applied normal to the plane
of the 2DEG corresponding to a quantum Hall ﬁlling fac-
tor νbulk = 2/3. We determine the eﬀective ﬁlling factor
νQPC in the constriction from the diagonal conductance
G = ISD/VD = νQPC e2/h [13, 18].

III. SPATIAL MAPPING OF LOCALLY

INDUCED FRACTIONAL FILLING FACTORS

Figure 1(c) shows the conductance G(x, y) as a func-
tion of tip position (x, y) [19]. Without the tip induced
perturbation, the potential landscape of the constriction
can be approximated by a saddle point [20]. Bringing the

and the QPC deﬁned by top gates (blue). The tip is biased
with -10 V and kept at a ﬁxed distance of 110 nm to the GaAs
surface. (b) Scanning electron microscope image of the sample
showing the top gates (light gray) that deﬁne the constriction.

tip closer adds two additional constrictions, one between
each gate and the region of depleted 2DEG below the tip
[21]. The tip position determines which of the three con-
strictions will limit the diagonal conductance by having
the lowest electron density and thus forming the lowest
ﬁlling factor νmin on the path from source to drain.
To study diﬀerent conﬁning potentials we chose three
1.5 µm×0.5 µm high resolution scan frames 1(cid:13) - 3(cid:13). Their
positions are marked by red rectangles in Fig. 1(c). Dots
indicate the origins of their respective coordinate systems
(x-axis parallel to long side). Scan frames 1(cid:13) and 2(cid:13) are
chosen to slightly modify and shift the split-gate deﬁned
constriction. 3(cid:13) is placed along the direction of current
ﬂow through the QPC such that the constriction of lowest
ﬁlling factor νmin is shifted towards the left hand side.

We investigate the eﬀect of the diﬀerent tip positions
by calculating the electron density in the vicinity of the
constriction using ﬁnite-element simulation [22]. The
model includes Thomas-Fermi screening [23] and ﬁnite
thickness of the 2DEG [23, 24]. For each scan frame we
use the tip coordinate at the intersection of the green
dashed line and the ν = 1/3 stripe in Fig. 1(c) and
a tip-surface distance of 110 nm. Figure 2(a) illustrates
the model geometry for scan frame 1(cid:13) and the electron
density of the 2DEG in color scale. The calculated elec-
tron densities for scan frames 1(cid:13) - 3(cid:13) in Figs. 2(b)-(d)

show that the constriction with lowest electron density
νmin lies inside the lithographic gap for 1(cid:13) and 2(cid:13), but is
shifted by ≈ 500 nm in 3(cid:13). Therefore the potential land-
scape at νmin is not only modiﬁed by the tip potential,
but also by the lateral shift with respect to the disorder
potential.
We measured G(x, y) in 1(cid:13), 2(cid:13), and 3(cid:13) with a horizon-
tal resolution of 5 nm at eight diﬀerent mixing chamber
temperatures T between 35 mK and 800 mK. Results and
evaluation will be discussed exemplarily for scan frame
1(cid:13), results from 2(cid:13) and 3(cid:13) have been analyzed in the same
way.
Figure 3(a) shows G(x, y = 250 nm) along the center
line y = 250 nm of 1(cid:13) at 35 mK. The full data set G(x, y)
is displayed in Fig. 3(b) as a color plot. The data shows
a pronounced νQPC = 1/3 plateau at G = 1/3 × e2/h.
The spatial extent of this plateau is visible as a dark belt
in the numerically calculated modulus of the gradient of
ISD(x, y) [25] in Fig. 3(c). Repeating the measurement
at higher temperature qualitatively shows the same fea-
tures, but the plateau of νQPC = 1/3 has an increased
slope due to thermal activation.

IV. ACTIVATION ENERGIES

The temperature dependence of the slope of the
νQPC = 1/3 plateau is used to determine the activation
energy ∆ of the ν = 1/3 state [14, 26] in this conﬁned

geometry. The algorithm for determining the slope at
each temperature T by linear ﬁtting is the following:

The onset x1(y) of the plateau of G(x, y) for every
scanned line y is deﬁned by the minimum of the smoothed
d2G(x, y)/d2x. Analogously, the end of the plateau x2(y)
is deﬁned by the maximum of the curvature. The slope
s(y) of the plateau for every scan line y is obtained by
linear ﬁtting G(x, y) in the interval [x1 +(x2−x1)/8, x2−
(x2 − x1)/8]. We calculate the mean slope ˆs = (cid:104)s(y)(cid:105)
and repeat this algorithm for every scan frame 1(cid:13) - 3(cid:13)
and all temperatures T . Figure 4 is an Arrhenius plot
of the mean values ˆs 1(cid:13)(T ), ˆs 2(cid:13)(T ), and ˆs 3(cid:13)(T ). The
uncertainties of the data points are given by the standard
deviation of s(y) for every scan frame and temperature.
The mean plateau slopes ˆs 1(cid:13)(T ), ˆs 2(cid:13)(T ), and ˆs 3(cid:13)(T )
are ﬁtted with an exponential temperature dependence
a · exp( − ∆/2kBT ) + b. For the three scan frames we
obtain activation energies ∆ 1(cid:13) = 153 ± 4 µeV, ∆ 2(cid:13) =
187 ± 6 µeV, and ∆ 3(cid:13) = 194 ± 4 µeV. The uncertainty

of ∆ is given by the square root of the corresponding
diagonal element of the ﬁt covariance matrix, but under-
estimates systematic errors in the measurement. Due to
insuﬃcient thermal anchoring of the sample leads, the
electron temperature of the sample is higher than the
cryostat temperature T . This leads to a non-zero satu-
ration parameter b.

plateau as function of temperature for all three scan frames.
Fits a·exp(−∆/2kBT )+b to the data give activation energies
of 153− 194 µeV. Inset: entire temperature range showing the
saturation at T < 200 mK.

V. FINITE BIAS MEASUREMENTS

Finite-bias measurements are an alternative way to
measure the energy gap of quantum Hall states [13, 27].
Increasing the source-drain bias voltage decreases the ex-
tent of QH plateaus until they vanish at a critical bias
voltage Vcrit. In a single-particle picture, the energy eVcrit
corresponds to the energy gap of the system [28].
Additionally to the ac source-drain voltage VSD−ac we
applied a dc voltage VSD−dc = [−0.5, +0.5] mV and mea-
sured the conductance G(x, VSD−dc) at base temperature.
The tip positions x are on the center lines y = 250 nm
of the scan frames (green dashed lines in Fig. 1(c)).
The numerical derivative of the ac source drain current
dISD−ac/dx as function of VSD−dc and tip position x is
shown in Fig. 5. In the center of the images, the ﬁnite
bias diamond of the ν = 1/3 state is visible. As indicated
by the dotted lines, the diamonds of all scan frames close
at a dc voltage Vcrit ≈ 400 µV. In agreement with scan-
ning gate measurements in the integer QH regime we ﬁnd
that Vcrit is independent of tip position [13].

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have used the ﬂexibility of SGM to induce the frac-
tional quantum Hall state ν = 1/3 in diﬀerent conﬁn-
ing potentials. The activation energies measured in scan
frames with lateral tip position ( 1(cid:13) and 2(cid:13), which are
expected to induce similar potential landscapes) diﬀer
by a value larger than the diﬀerence to the one mea-
sured in the scan frame with on-axis tip position ( 3(cid:13)).
We conclude that the inﬂuence of the changed potential
landscape must be smaller than the experimental accu-
racy. Furthermore, ﬁnite bias measurements conﬁrmed

4

that the energy gaps are independent of tip position.
Therefore our experiments indicate that the activation
energy of a conﬁned ν = 1/3 state depends only weakly
on the shape of the conﬁning potential.
