Abstract: In proton-proton collisions there is a smooth transition between the regime of double
parton scattering, initiated by two pairs of partons at a large relative distance, and the regime
where a single parton splits into a parton pair in one or both protons. We present a scheme for
computing both contributions in a consistent and practicable way.

1 Ultraviolet behaviour of double parton scattering

The familiar factorisation formula for double parton scattering (DPS) reads

dσDPS

dx1 d¯x1 dx2 d¯x2

=

1
C

ˆσ1 ˆσ2Z d2y F (x1, x2, y) F (¯x1, ¯x2, y) ,

(1)

where C is a combinatorial factor, ˆσ1,2 is the cross section for the ﬁrst or second hard-scattering
subprocess, and F (x1, x2, y) is a double parton distribution (DPD). y denotes the transverse dis-
tance between the two partons. A ﬁeld theoretical deﬁnition of F (x1, x2, y) is naturally given
by the matrix element between proton states of two twist-two operators at relative transverse dis-
tance y. As explained in [1], the leading behaviour of DPDs at small y is controlled by the splitting
of one parton into two, shown in ﬁgure 1a. The corresponding expression reads

F (x1, x2, y) =

1
y2

αs

for small y .

For simplicity we dropped labels for the different parton species and polarisations, as we already
did in (1).

Inserting the short-distance limit (2) in the cross-section formula (1) reveals an immediate prob-
lem: the integration over y diverges strongly in the ultraviolet. In fact, the approximations that
lead to (1) are not valid when y becomes too small (compared with the inverse of the large mo-
mentum scale Q of the hard scattering). This unphysical ultraviolet divergence signals another
problem, namely one of double counting: the graph in ﬁgure 1b shows a contribution to double
parton scattering, with perturbative splitting in each DPD. Drawn as in ﬁgure 1c, the same graph
gives however a contribution to single parton scattering (SPS) at higher loop order. For multi-jet
production this problem was already pointed out in [2].

2 A consistent scheme

The following scheme provides a consistent treatment of single and double scattering contribu-
tions to a given process, and it removes the ultraviolet divergence in the naive double scattering
formula just discussed. We regulate the DPS cross section (1) by inserting a function under the
integral over DPDs,

Z d2y (cid:2)Φ(νy)(cid:3)2 F (x1, x2, y) F (¯x1, ¯x2, y) ,

(3)

which is chosen such that Φ(u) → 0 for u → 0 and Φ(u) → 1 for u ≫ 1. (We take the square of Φ in
order to have a closer connection to the case discussed in section 5.) This removes contributions
with distances y = |y| below 1/ν from what is deﬁned to be double parton scattering. An appro-
priate choice for this cutoff scale is ν ∼ Q. Double and single parton scattering are then combined
as

σDPS − σsub + σSPS ,

(4)

where σDPS is the regulated DPS cross section and σSPS the SPS cross section computed in the
usual way (given by ﬁgure 1c and its crossed variants in our example). The subtraction term
σsub is given by the DPS cross section with both DPDs replaced by the splitting expression (2),
computed at ﬁxed order in perturbation theory and used at all y. Note that at any order in αs, the
computation of σsub is technically much simpler than the one of σSPS.

Let us see how this construction solves the double counting problem. We work differentially
in y, which is Fourier conjugate to a speciﬁc transverse momentum variable as speciﬁed in [1]
and can thus be given an unambiguous meaning, not only in the DPS cross section but also in the
box graph of ﬁgure 1c and the associated term σSPS. For y ∼< 1/Q one has σDPS ≈ σsub because
the perturbative approximation (2) of the DPD works well in that region. The dependence on
the cutoff function Φ(νy) then cancels between σDPS and σsub, and one is left with σ ≈ σSPS. For
y ≫ 1/Q one has σsub ≈ σSPS, because in that region the box graph can be approximated just as
is done in the DPS formula. One is thus left with σ ≈ σDPS at large y, and the cutoff function
Φ(yν) ≈ 1 does not have any effect there. The construction just explained is a special case of
the general subtraction formalism discussed in chapter 10 of [3], and it works order by order in
perturbation theory.

3 Splitting and intrinsic contributions to DPDs

At small y a DPD – deﬁned as a hadronic matrix element as already mentioned – contains not
only the perturbative splitting contribution described by (2) but also an “intrinsic” part in which
the two partons do not originate from one and the same “parent” parton. We emphasise that our
scheme does not need to distinguish these “splitting” and “intrinsic” contributions when setting
up the factorisation formula for the cross section. In fact, we do not know how such a separation
could be realised in a ﬁeld theoretic deﬁnition valid at all y.
It is only when writing down a
parameterisation of F (x1, x2, y) that has the small-y limit predicted by QCD that we separate the
DPD into splitting and intrinsic pieces.

If we consider the DPS cross section formula at small y and take the splitting contribution
for only one of the two protons, then we obtain the “1 vs 2” contribution depicted in ﬁgure 2a,
which has been discussed in detail in [4, 5], [6, 7] and [8]. The corresponding integral in the cross
section goes like d2y/y2 and thus still diverges at small y if treated naively. In our regulated DPS
integral (3), it gives a ﬁnite contribution with a logarithmic dependence on the cutoff scale ν.

Just as the 1 vs 1 contribution of ﬁgure 1b corresponds to the SPS graph 1c, the 1 vs 2 contri-
bution of ﬁgure 2a corresponds to a contribution with a twist-two distribution (i.e. a usual parton
density) for one proton and a twist-four distribution for the other proton, shown in ﬁgure 2b. The

complete cross section is then obtained as

σ = σDPS − σsub (1vs1) + σSPS − σsub (1vs2) + σtw2 × tw4 .

(5)

The DPS term contains the full DPDs and thus generates 1 vs 1, 1 vs 2 and the usual 2 vs 2 contri-
butions. The terms σsub (1vs1) and σSPS were discussed in the previous section. The term σtw2 × tw4
corresponds to ﬁgure 2b, and the associated subtraction term σsub (1vs2) is obtained from the DPS
formula by replacing one DPD with its perturbative splitting approximation (2) and the other
DPD with a twist-four distribution.

Since very little is known about parton distributions of twist four, including σtw2 × tw4−σsub (1vs2)
in the cross section is a challenge for phenomenology. One can however show that with the choice
ν ∼ Q this combination is subleading in logarithms log(Q/Λ) compared to the 1 vs 2 part of σDPS
and can hence be dropped at leading logarithmic accuracy.

4 DGLAP logarithms

As discussed in [1], the DPDs F (x1, x2, y) are subject to homogeneous DGLAP evolution, with
one DGLAP kernel for the parton with momentum fraction x1 and another for the parton with
momentum fraction x2. One can show that the evolved distributions in the DPS cross section
correctly resum large DGLAP logarithms in higher-order graphs. An example is the 1 vs 2 graph
in ﬁgure 3a, which builds up a logarithm log2(Q/Λ) in the region Λ ≪ |k| ≪ Q, compared with
the single log(Q/Λ) of the graph without gluon emission. Similarly, the higher-order SPS graph in
ﬁgure 3b builds up a logarithm log(Q2/Q1) in the region Q1 ≪ |k| ≪ Q2 if the scales Q1 and Q2
of the two hard scatters are strongly ordered among themselves. This type of logarithm is readily
included in the cross section by taking separate renormalisation scales µ1,2 ∼ Q1,2 for the two
partons in the DPDs.

5 Extension to measured transverse momenta

So far we have discussed DPS and SPS in collinear factorisation, where the net transverse momen-
tum q1 and q2 of the particles produced by each hard scatter is integrated over. As shown in [1],

4

DPS can also be formulated for small measured q1 and q2 by generalising the corresponding for-
malism for SPS (which is e.g. documented in chapter 13 of [3]). Our scheme is readily extended to
this case. The DPS cross section then involves a regularised integral

Z d2y d2z1 d2z2 e−iq1 z1−iq2 z2 Φ(νy+) Φ(νy−) F (x1, x2, z1, z2, y) F (¯x1, ¯x2, z1, z2, y) ,

(6)

where F (x1, x2, z1, z2, y) is a transverse-momentum dependent DPD transformed to impact pa-
rameter space. The perturbative splitting mechanism renders these distributions singular at the

rithmic divergences that appear in the naive DPS formula.
