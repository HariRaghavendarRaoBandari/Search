The exact form of the Bohm criterion for a collisional plasma

(Dated: March 3, 2016)

A long-standing debate in the literature about the kinetic form of the Bohm criterion is resolved for
plasmas with single positive ion species when transport is dominated by charge exchange collisions.
The solution of the Boltzmann equation for the ions gives the exact form free of any divergence and
contains an additional term that is not included in the classical result. This term includes collisional
and geometric eﬀects and leads to a noticeable correction. Further, the question is addressed whether
the space charge argument at the bottom of the Bohm criterion can actually lead to a meaningful
deﬁnition of the transition point between bulk and sheath. The analysis is supported by a numerical
model and experiments, showing excellent agreement throughout. As a novelty in diagnostics, the
theoretical results allow from the ion velocity distribution function (IVDF), measured at the wall,
a reconstruction of the IVDF and the electric ﬁeld at any point in the plasma. This property is
used to reconstruct non-intrusively also the ion density, ﬂow velocity, mean energy and eﬀective
temperature and the electron density and temperature as functions of the spatial coordinate and
potential. Finally, the ﬂuid equation for ion momentum balance is veriﬁed.

The work of Bohm [1] introduced a new concept about
the sheaths forming in plasmas near walls – the space
charge has to increase monotonously with the potential
ϕ: ∂ne/∂ϕ ≥ ∂ni/∂ϕ, where ne and ni are the electron
and ion density. This will be termed weak form of the
criterion. The strong form n−1
i ∂ni/∂ϕ is
derived from it and is also commonly used. For mono-
energetic collisionless ions this entails that the ions attain

e ∂ne/∂ϕ ≥ n−1

the ion sound velocity ci =pkTe/M (k is the Boltzmann

constant, M the ion mass and Te the electron tempera-
ture) before entering the sheath [2]. Coincidentally, at
this velocity the quasi-neutral solutions for the plasma
bulk break down, promoting the ubiquitous use of this
result as a boundary condition for numerical simulations
and sheath models. The concept of the Bohm criterion
has been also extended to account for multiple charged
species [3] as well as for species possessing arbitrary ve-
locity distribution functions [4–6]. For the case of sin-
gle species of positive ions and electrons the criterion is

(cid:10)ε−1
i (cid:11) ≤(cid:10)ε−1
note (cid:10)ε−1

the velocity distribution functions of electrons fe and ions
fi and εe,i is their kinetic energy. In the following we de-

e (cid:11) [7]. The brackets stand for averaging over
e (cid:11) = 2Be. The sheath edge is associated with

the point where the condition is marginally satisﬁed [7].
This formulation of the sheath criterion contains a diver-
gence for the ionic part [8] and does not give a meaningful
result at elevated pressures [9, 10].

The treatment here removes this divergence and adds
an additional term that restores the validity of the cri-
terion for any collisionality. Furthermore, the general
concept of a Bohm criterion is discussed and the analysis
is supported by a numerical simulation and experiment,
involving also a new diagnostic concept.

The distribution of the electrons near the sheath edge

is nearly isotropic due to the repelling sheath and (cid:10)ε−1
e (cid:11)

is well deﬁned. Owing to the accelerating ﬁeld near the
sheath edge the distribution of the ions is mostly one-

dimensional. When ions with zero velocity are present

(cid:10)ε−1
i (cid:11) diverges. The common assumption [11–13] fi(v =

0) = 0 does not hold for charge-exchange (CX) collisions
typical for e.g. atomic ions in their parent gas. This is vis-
ible from the solution of the Boltzmann equation (BE) in-
cluding collision operators for charge-exchange collisions
(with a constant mean free-path λ):

Here E(r) is the electrostatic ﬁeld and e is the elemen-

gle spatial R ≥ r ≥ 0 and velocity coordinate v ≥ 0
for simple geometries (plane: κ = 0, cylinder: κ = 1,
sphere: κ = 2). Ionization by electrons (ionization fre-
quency: νiz(r) with cross section from [14]) determines

at an energy of ε = 1

v = 0 ↔ r′ = r and v = vmax(r) ↔ r′ = 0 and r′(v, r)
is a function of the total energy. Further, clearly g(v =

eE(r) Q(r) 6= 0.

From (1) the strong form of the Bohm criterion be-
comes Bλ + Bi ≤ Be where a very small term containing
g(vmax)/(M vmax) has been neglected. The two ion terms

The term Bi corresponds to the classical ion term found
in the literature but without the divergence, that re-
sults only from an invalid partial integration. The new
term Bλ is of key importance especially under conditions
of high collisionality or strong geometrical eﬀects, e.g.
around probes. The importance of this term under col-
lisional conditions is demonstrated here by experiments
and a model.

The model with cylindrical symmetry (κ = 1) aims at
simulating the experiment described subsequently. The
model solves numerically the continuity and momentum
equation for ions and Poisson’s equation along the radial
coordinate r for the ion ﬂow velocity u, the ion density ni,
and the electric ﬁeld E. Further, the electric ﬁeld is inte-
grated to yield the plasma potential ϕ. From these data
then the IVDF is calculated via equation (3) and used
for determination of the kinetic moments. The electron
density ne, temperature Te, and ionization rate viz are
calculated from the measured non-local EEPF (FIG. 1)
as a function of the plasma potential and serve as an in-
put to the ion equations. Note that the only input to the
calculated IVDF from the ﬂuid model is the electric ﬁeld
/ potential. The ion momentum equation is:

u∂u/∂r = eE/M −π/(2λ)upu2 + u2

z −νimu−νizune/ni.
(6)

The factor π/2 in the CX momentum loss term has been
discussed in the literature [15] and is further discussed
here in comparison with the experiment. In addition to
charge exchange (λ = 1.52 cm [16]) also elastic colli-
sions (vmi = 5.4 104 s−1 [16]) and a ﬁnite axial velocity
(vz = 640 m/s, 12% of ci on the axis, ci0) equivalent to
the ion thermal velocity are taken into account. These
eﬀects are signiﬁcant only at very low energies in the cen-
tral part of the plasma (r < R/2). In the IVDF at the
wall this corresponds to ions with εi > 30 eV (FIG. 1).
Further, in the radial continuity equation the axial ﬂow
is taken into account by a reduced ionization frequency
νizr = νiz(1 − η). The parameter η is adjusted so that
ﬂux balance is reached at the wall at r = R. Indeed a
reasonable value of η = 0.455 is found. The neutral gas
density determining the values of all collision parame-
ters follows from the measured neon pressure p = 1.3 Pa
and the gas temperature T g = 400 K. The latter value
is estimated from earlier measurements in argon [17] ac-
counting for the diﬀerent heat conductivities of the gases.
Initial conditions on the axis (r = 0) are zero ion velocity
u, electric ﬁeld and potential ϕ. The ion density in the
center, n0 = 3.0 1016 m−3, is from the experiment.

For the experiments an inductively coupled plasma
in neon at p = 1.3 Pa and a power of 600 W is
used. Details about the cylindrical discharge chamber
(R = 25 cm) can be found in [18]. The measurements
are in a horizontal plane 24 cm below the inductive an-
tenna (FIG. 1(b)): plasma bulk parameters by a home-
made Langmuir probe, LP, (tip length and radius 9 and
0.05 mm) and mass-selected IVDF by a Balzers Plasma
Process Monitor, PPM. The calibration of the energy
axis is checked against a Retarding Field Energy Anal-
yser, RFEA. The entrance oriﬁces of both devices are
1 cm closer to the chamber axis. The probe enters the

chamber through an oriﬁce of 2 cm in diameter.

The measured IVDF for a mass 20 amu (FIG. 1(a))
shows depletion of low energy ions. This is corrected

by an energy-dependent factor ψ(ε) = cosh−2(cid:16)pεc/ε(cid:17),

derived from a model that assumes a homogeneous ion
beam of density ni inside the PPM that traverses a length
L. The adjustable parameter εc = e2niL2/(4ε0), with ε0
the permittivity of vacuum, gives for εc = 408 eV ex-
cellent agreement with the IVDF reconstructed from the
ﬂuid model (FIG. 1(a)). Deviations between the mea-
sured and the simulated IVDF can be noticed for εi > 30
eV which is most likely related to elastic collisions and a
ﬁnite axial velocity as discussed above.

Further on, moments are shown only for εi > 7 eV,
since IVDF data points are missing at lower energies. For
the evaluation of quantities from the IVDF the transla-
tion property of the solution (3) is used: g(ε, r(ϕ)) =
g(ε − eϕ, R) (r/R)κ exp [(R − r)/λ]. The obtained quan-
tities are a function of the potential shift ϕ. The elec-
tric ﬁeld is obtained from (4). In the range of validity
of both diagnostics (21 to 32 eV) the electric ﬁeld mea-
sured by the LP via the plasma potential deviates from
the one derived from the IVDF by not more than 13%.
This allows also construction of part of the IVDF at the
wall from the LP data in the bulk with excellent agree-
ment (FIG. 1(a)). The spatial coordinate as a function

of the potential results from x = −R dϕ/E. Since the

integrand requires also data starting from zero energy,
extrapolation is used between ε = 0 and ε = 7 eV. How-
ever, this range contributes only marginally. The mea-
surement of only relative ion ﬂuxes requires calibration
of the ion density, made via the LP data at Vp = 22 V
(r = 23.5 cm).

The electron energy probability functions, EEPF [19],
obtained with the LP by the Druyvesteyn method show
non-local behaviour [20] fe = fe0(εe−eϕ) (FIG. 1(c)), ex-
pected at low pressure (electron energy relaxation length
much larger than R). The envelope of all distribution
functions, fe0, is parametrized and used to calculate the
electron quantities as function of the potential.

The uncertainties in the experimental data are esti-
mated from the uncertainties in the measured IVDF and
the precision of the calibration. Typically they are in the
range 5 to 10% and often the error bars do not exceed the
size of the symbols in the graphs. The precision of the
LP data are estimated from the resolution of the probe
system (16 bit in current and voltage) and are below 5%.
The terms in the strong Bohm criterion, obtained both
from the experimental IVDF and EEPF and from the re-
constructed IVDF from the ﬂuid model, are compared in
FIG. 2. The new ion term Bλ is comparable in magnitude
to the classical term Bi, revealing the importance of its
addition. This becomes clear also in FIG. 2(b) where Bi
and Be do not have a crossing point and a deﬁnition of a
sheath edge is not possible. With the inclusion of Bλ the

tal IVDF (open green circles), eﬀective ion temperature Ti

set: model (curves) and experimental (symbols) values of the
terms in the ion momentum balance (1 – πM u2/(2eEλ); 2 –
∂(M u2/2)/(∂eϕ)). The bottom and left axes show absolute
values and the top and right axes are in normalized units.
The vertical lines are as in FIG. 1.

ionic component becomes nearly equal to the electronic
one at about the position where u = ci (marked by a
vertical line). It is also remarkable that Bi has a max-
imum at nearly the same position. In the plasma bulk
(u < ci) the two ionic terms have opposite signs and are
large in magnitude. Therefore, their sum is experimen-
tally very sensitive to noise, hence the large error bars.

There is also a slight diﬀerence in the value of the poten-
tial over the plasma obtained experimentally and from
the model. The diﬀerence is about 5% and stems from
the uncertainty in the ion friction and in the electron
temperature.

From the experimental

ion density ni(ϕ) and elec-
tric ﬁeld E(ϕ) the electron density ne(ϕ) can be ob-
tained via Poisson’s equation. This allows an esti-
mate for the electron temperature to be obtained via
kTe/e = ne(∂ne/∂ϕ)−1, which is based on assuming
Boltzmann distributed electrons. These values show re-
markable agreement with the values from LP data (inset
of FIG. 2(a)). Naturally, this delicate analysis is limited
to the region around the maximum of the IVDF.

The IVDF delivers also information on the eﬀective ion

increases nearly linearly with the potential in the sheath
(very weakly collisional sheath) and reaches the expected

temperature kTi = M(cid:0)(cid:10)v2(cid:11) − u2(cid:1) and the mean energy
hεii = M(cid:10)v2(cid:11) /2 (inset of FIG. 2(a)). The mean energy
2i ≈ 4.84kTe (me is the
value of kTehlnpM/(2πme) + 1

electron mass) at the wall. This value follows from the
balance of ion and electron ﬂuxes at the wall. The result
demonstrates again the consistency of experiment and
model. The eﬀective ion temperature increases in the
plasma bulk due to ion collisions. Ti increases also in the
sheath due to small but ﬁnite friction as can be seen in the
analysis of its contribution to the momentum equation
(inset of FIG. 2(c)).

The validity of the major approximations in the ﬂuid
model can also be tested using the experimental data.
The inset of FIG. 2(c) shows a comparison of the ratio of
the leading terms in the ion momentum balance. Curve
and symbols denoted as 1 are the ratio of the CX mo-
mentum loss term to the electric force term. Curve and
symbols 2 show the contribution of ion inertia relative to
the electric force. To our knowledge this is the ﬁrst di-
rect experimental test of the ﬂuid equations that reveals
the expected behaviour – the ion friction is dominant in
the plasma bulk and the ion inertia controls the sheath.
The ratio of the sheath width s ≈ 0.2 cm (FIG. 3) to λ
is 0.13. Accordingly, CX friction contributes about 13%
to the momentum balance.

The sum of the two ratios is larger than 1 by about
20% in the transition region between bulk and sheath.
Here the factor π/2 used in the ﬂuid equation (6) un-
derestimates the CX-friction. Indeed, the factor is exact
only in homogenous ﬁelds and the large gradients in the
transition region lead to small but noticeable deviations.
This observation agrees well with the discussion in [15].
As a consequence ﬂuid and kinetic ﬂow velocities devi-
ate slightly in FIG. 2(c). Nevertheless, the error is small
since the spatial region extends only over a few λD ≪ λ
(λD = 0.3 mm is the Debye length at the Bohm point).
Finally the suitability of the Bohm criterion for pro-
viding a condition for the sheath edge needs to be dis-

FIG. 3. Weak form of the Bohm criterion: the diagonal cor-
responds to both terms being equal (the bulk) and in the
sheath the ion part drops below the value for the electron
part. Shown is also the collisionless sheath expression (red

the measurements. Inset: ion (red) and electron (black) den-

cussed. In FIG. 3 the weak form of the Bohm criterion is
presented. For convenience both axes are normalized by
kTeB/n0, kTeB is the electron temperature at the point
where u = ci. For a homogeneous electron temperature
the abscissa would be identical to the relative electron
density and both scales would run from zero to one. The
simulation results are well conﬁrmed by the experimental
values which are constructed from the IVDF (ionic part)
and the EEPF (electronic part). The ﬁgure shows the
obvious fact that in a plasma always ne < ni, even in
the center. Therefore, the derivatives are identical only
in the center and far into the sheath. The latter identity
results from the fact that space charge has a maximum
when the electron density has eﬀectively vanished but
the ion density has not decreased too much. However,
this point in the lower left corner is apparently unsuit-
able for the purpose of deﬁning a transition point from
the quasi-neutral bulk to the sheath.

On the other hand, the quasi-neutral ﬂuid equations
for the bulk yield under any collisionality a divergence at
the ion sound speed in the derivatives of the potential,
the density, and the ion velocity as can be seen e.g. from
the velocity equation u′ ∝ (c2
i − u2)−1. Traditionally, the
ion sound speed ci is identiﬁed as the Bohm speed uB
by assuming collisionless ions and neglecting ionization
in the sheath. The corresponding solution is also shown
in FIG. 3:

The potential diﬀerence to the Bohm point ∆ϕ and the
ion density ratio n0/nB = 8.65 are taken from the model.
Apparently the interception between this formula and
the diagonal, which corresponds to the equality in the
classical Bohm criterion, is well oﬀ the correct solution.

Further, the above formula has an inherent divergence
at ∆ϕ = kTeB/2 which always leads to an interception,
i.e. to a solution. However, this solution is clearly incor-
rect. In reality, for any ﬁnite collisionality and ionization,
the transition between the sheath and the bulk region is
smooth and gradual and there is no interception any-
where. The curve comes very close to the diagonal but
it never intercepts it so that the Bohm criterion never
applies with an equal sign. Solutions are only found by
using it with an incorrect formula.

In conclusion, the existing kinetic form of the Bohm
criterion has been corrected by removing the inherent
divergence in the ionic term. Consistent derivation shows
that there exists a second term, that stems from collisions
and geometry eﬀects. Without it, the equality sign in the
Bohm criterion, that deﬁnes the sheath edge position,
can not be satisﬁed. Analysis shows that even then the
equality holds only approximately and strictly speaking
the Bohm criterion does not deﬁne the sheath edge. The
condition u = ci still remains a meaningful deﬁnition of
the sheath edge, but it no longer follows from the classical
Bohm criterion.

The authors are grateful to Prof. Satoshi Hamaguchi
for several inspiring discussions over the course of this
investigation. Further, the authors want to note that
they have contributed equally to this work.
