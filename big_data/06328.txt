In this article, we consider an interesting class of optical and other systems in which the interaction
or coupling makes the systems to be PT -symmetric. We aim to compare their dynamical behaviors
In particular, we
with that of the usual PT symmetric systems with intrinsic loss-gain terms.
focus on the interesting non-reciprocal nature of the PT symmetric systems which has a promising
application in optical diodes and optical isolators. We check whether the non-reciprocal nature
is common to all PT symmetric systems and, if not, what are the situations under which it can
be observed. Due to the recent interest in studying spontaneous symmetry breaking in coupled
waveguide systems, we here present such symmetry breaking bifurcations in reciprocal and non-
reciprocal PT symmetric systems.

INTRODUCTION

Explorations on PT symmetric systems [1] open up
interesting observations and applications in a variety of
ﬁelds such as optics [2–6], plasmonics [7, 8], quantum
optics [9, 10], Bose-Einstein condensation [11, 12],
acoustics [13], electronics [14, 15] and mechanics [16–18].
In the literature such PT symmetric structures were
constructed straightforwardly by coupling a system with
loss to a system with equal amount of gain. One can
even ﬁnd interesting experimental realizations of such
PT symmetric systems [5, 19]. However, the latter ﬁnds
a stringent condition in the practical realization whereby
the balance between the loss and gain is expected.
Due to the above, the exploration of PT symmetric
structures without intrinsic loss-gain is interesting and
is more advantageous if one ﬁnds a better adaptable
structure.

In this connection, we here considered the problem
of studying the loss-gain free PT symmetric systems.
We present one such class of systems in which the PT
symmetric nature is introduced through the coupling. In
such loss-gain free systems with PT symmetric coupling,
we study the dynamics in comparison with the usual
PT symmetric systems with loss-gain and we check
whether the dynamics of these systems include the novel
characteristics of the usual PT symmetric systems with
loss-gain. Due to the existence of loss-gain terms, the
usual PT symmetric systems are considered as special
cases of dissipative systems and are found to lie at the
boundary between conservative and dissipative systems.
Now considering the systems with PT interaction,
one can ﬁnd not only dissipative systems but also
conservative systems. Thus it is also interesting to note
the dynamics of conservative PT symmetric structures
in comparison with dissipative ones.

One of the most interesting and useful characteristics

of classical PT symmetric systems is the non-reciprocal
nature which helps to localize the energy in the gain
component of the coupled systems [20]. Thus there
occurs unidirectional propagation of light in the usual
PT symmetric systems. But in the systems which we
consider there are no loss or gain terms and thus we look
at whether such non-reciprocal nature sustains in these
In other
generalized PT symmetric systems as well.
words we search whether the non-reciprocal nature is
common to all types of PT -symmetric systems.
If it
is not then what are the situations in which one can
observe non-reciprocity in these systems? The present
article shows the criteria required for the existence of
non-reciprocity in these PT symmetric systems are the
existence of localizing nonlinearity and non-conservative
nature.
Also we note the spontaneous symmetry
breaking bifurcations in certain cases of this class of
systems. With some conservative cases, we show the
spontaneous symmetry breaking through the pitchfork
bifurcation in the reciprocal cases and the spontaneous
symmetry breaking through a tangent like bifurcation in
non-reciprocal cases.

In order to focus on the above objectives, we present
this manuscript in the following form.
In Sec. 2, we
consider conservative systems with linear PT -symmetric
coupling. We show that these PT symmetric conser-
vative structures show reciprocal dynamics as in the
case of usual conservative systems. Thus, we add non-
conservative nature into the system in Sec.
3 and
study their dynamics. We show the appearance of non-
reciprocal nature in these non-conservative PT symmet-
ric structures and also we discuss the necessary elements
such as localizing nonlinearity needed for the presence of
non-reciprocal nature in the systems with linear-PT cou-
pling. In Sec. 4, we investigate systems with nonlinear
PT coupling and discuss the necessary elements needed
for the non-reciprocal nature of the system. In Sec. 5,
we present our conclusions.

In this section, we consider conservative systems with
linear PT symmetric coupling. To start with, we con-
sider a simple optical nonlinear PT -symmetric dimer,

In the above system, β represents the strength of self-
focusing nonlinearity. k corresponds to the coupling due
to the evanscent ﬁelds while a represents the PT cou-
pling. The above PT type coupling in such directional
couplers can be achieved with the use of magneto-optical
materials or gyromagnetic materials such as Yttrium Iron
Garnette (YIG) [21, 22]. Note that the system (1) does
not have any direct loss or gain term and is still invariant
under the PT operation φ1 → −φ2, φ2 → −φ1, i → −i
and z → −z. Also one can ﬁnd that the system is con-
servative, so that

P = |φ1|2 + |φ2|2.

Now let us look at how the wave amplitudes evolve with
respect to the propagation distance, z, and compare their
dynamics with that of the usual PT symmetric systems
with loss-gain proﬁle. For this purpose, we ﬁrst look into
the dynamics in the linear case of the system (1)

The corresponding eigenvalues of the linear problem are

λ = ±√a2 + k2. This shows the existence of a completely
real eigenvalue spectrum which corresponds to unbroken
PT symmetry for all parametric values of (k, a). This
is in contrast to the linear PT symmetric system with
loss-gain corresponding to the Hamiltonian

−k −iγ (cid:19)
H =(cid:18) iγ −k

(6)

where γ is the loss-gain strength and its eigenvalues are

λ = ±pk2 − γ2. Here, an increase in loss-gain strength

makes the eigenvalues to be imaginary and thus the sym-
metry will be spontaneously broken.

P1(0) − P2(0)

FIG. 1: (a) Figure shows the stable regions of symmetric as
well as asymmetric ﬁxed points where we have ﬁxed P (0) =
1.0, k = 0.5. Note that in the entire region , M1 is stable.
In Fig.
(b) we have given P1 − P2 for diﬀerent values of
P1(0) − P2(0) with k = 0.5 and a = 0.3.

With the introduction of the self-trapping nonlinearity,
we now check whether the nonlinear modes of light can
break the symmetry spontaneously. For the purpose, we
consider φ1(z) = R1(z)ei(ωz+θ1), φ2(z) = R2(z)ei(ωz+θ2)
in Eq.(1), where Ri(z), i = 1, 2 are the wave amplitudes,
ω is the propagation constant and θi, i = 1, 2 are the
constant phases. Upon substitution, one will obtain the
dynamical equations of corresponding to the amplitude
and phase diﬀerence δ = θ1 − θ2 as
˙R1 = kR2 sin δ + aR2 cos δ,
˙R2 = −kR1 sin δ − aR1 cos δ,
˙δ = (βR1R2 − k cos δ + a sin δ)

Note that the above equations are equivalent to the sys-
tem (1). As the system is conservative, we reduce the or-

der of the above equation (9) by taking R2 =pP − R2

Thus the deﬁning equations will reduce to the form

The stationary nonlinear modes correspond to the situa-
tion ˙R1 = ˙δ = 0. Thus from Eqs. (10-11), one can ﬁnd
the existence of symmetric nonlinear modes of the form

A couple of recent publications in Nature Photonics
[23, 24] deal with the above type of spontaneous symme-
try breaking in coupled waveguides where the authors
have compared such situations with the spontaneous
symmetry breaking in a double well potential through
pitchfork bifurcation. They noted that just like the par-
ticle in a double well is localized in one of the wells de-
pending upon its initial position, here also depending on
the input distribution of light (whether P1(0) > P2(0) or
P2(0) > P1(0)) it is localized in one of the waveguides. In
the following discussions, we observe that this pitchfork
type of symmetry breaking bifurcation has a relationship
with the reciprocal nature of the systems.

For both modes M3 and M4, sin δ∗ = −a
a2+k2 and cos δ∗ =
a2+k2 . Also from (14) and (15), we can ﬁnd that these
asymmetric modes exist only when β ≥ 2√a2+k2

The linear stability of each symmetric and asymmetric
modes has been studied and the results show that the
eigenvalues corresponding to each mode are

M4 : λ = ±ipP 2β2 − 4(a2 + k2), .

From the eigenvalues corresponding to the symmetric
modes M1 and M2 given in Eqs. (16) and (17), we can
ﬁnd that the mode M1 is found to be neutrally stable for
all parametric values whereas the mode M2 is neutrally
stable only when β < 2√a2+k2
In the above, neutral
stability corresponds to the pure imaginary eigenvalues.
The region in which this symmetric mode M2 is stable
is also shown in Fig. 1(a). From Eqs. (18) and (19),
one can ﬁnd that the eigenvalues corresponding to M3
and M4 are the same and these asymmetric modes are
found to be neutrally stable when β > 2√a2+k2
. Thus
from the above one can note that at β = 2√a2+k2
, a
pitchfork like bifurcation occurs which stabilizes the two
asymmetric modes M3 and M4 and breaks the PT sym-
metry spontaneously (since R∗1 6= R∗2). The stable region
of these asymmetric modes is also shown in Fig. 1(a).
Note that in the region β > 2√a2+k2
, not only the asym-
metric modes are stable but also the symmetric mode M1
is found to be neutrally stable.

Due to the above stability nature, for lower values of β
the propagation of symmetric modes occur for all input
power distributions among the ﬁrst and second waveg-
uides. On the other hand, for higher values of β, for only
certain input power distributions symmetric propagation
of light occurs and for other input distributions asym-
metric propagation of light occurs. Thus PT symmetry
is broken for higher values of β. Fig. 1(b) illustrates
the same, where we have represented the input power
distribution by P1(0) − P2(0) and the output power dis-
tribution is represented by P1 − P2. Both the quantities
(P1(0)−P2(0) and P1−P2) represent the symmetric state
when they are zero. From Fig.1(b), one can ﬁnd that for
β = 1.5 for all possible input power distributions the sys-
tem remains in symmetric state (as P1 − P2 = 0). When
β = 3.5, the same Fig. 1(b) shows that symmetric mode
propagation occurs only when P1(0)− P2(0) is around 0,
otherwise asymmetric mode propagation occurs (where
P1 − P2 is non-zero). Also one can observe from Fig.
1(b) that depending upon whether P1(0) > P2(0) or
P2(0) > P1(0), one of the asymmetric modes (M3 and
M4) is stabilized.

in the ﬁrst waveguide and in Figs.(b) and (d) it is given only

2.1.1. Reciprocal nature

1 |2(0) = 1, |φ(1)

2 |2(0) = 0 (ii) |φ(2)

The reciprocal nature of the system represents the time
reversibity and the non-reciprocal nature of the system
arises due to the suppression in the time-reversibility na-
ture. To determine whether the dynamics of the system is
reciprocal or non-reciprocal, we consider two input situa-
tions: (i) |φ(1)
1 |2(0) = 0,
|φ(2)
2 |2(0) = 1. If the system is reciprocal, in both the
unbroken and broken PT regions one can observe ex-
act matching in the beam propagation patterns in the
form |φ(i)
2 (z)|2, where i, j ∈ 1, 2 and i 6= j.
If the systems shows non-reciprocal dynamics, we ﬁnd
|φ(i)
1 (z)|2 6= |φ(j)
2 (z)|2, where i, j ∈ 1, 2 and i 6= j. For
system (1), Figs. 2(a), 2(b) and Figs. 2(c), 2(d) are plot-
ted, respectively, in the unbroken and broken PT regions
with respect to the initial power distributions given by
(i) and (ii). To check the reciprocal nature of the system,
2 |2 in Figs. 2(e) and 2(f),
respectively, for unbroken and broken cases. It is clear
from both the ﬁgures that the system is reciprocal.

we have plotted |φ(1)

1 (z)|2 = |φ(j)

1 |2 and |φ(2)

Speciﬁcally the dynamics in the broken PT region
(shown in Figs. 2(c) and 2(d)) emphasizes that the pitch-
fork bifurcation of asymmetric modes (or the stabiliza-
tion of both the asymmetric modes, the mode M3 with
P ∗1 > P ∗2 and M4 with P ∗2 > P ∗1 , where P ∗1 and P ∗2 are
the corresponding powers) is necessary for the reciprocal
nature of the system. If only one of the modes is stabi-
lized then we would observe the localization of light in
the same waveguide for both the input situations (i) and
2 (z)|2 in
such a situation. This emphasizes the relation between
the pitchfork bifurcation and the reciprocal nature of the
system. In Sec. 4, we show the occurrence of tangent bi-
furcation which stabilizes one of the asymmetric modes
leading to non-reciprocal nature in the system.

(ii). Thus we cannot achieve |φ(i)

1 (z)|2 = |φ(j)

2.2. General case:

The above discussions clearly show the absence of non-
reciprocal nature in the considered simple conservative
PT symmetric system. To know whether such behavior
is common to all conservative PT symmetric structure
with this type of linear coupling, we consider a general
conservative situation satisfying

dφ1
dz
dφ2
dz

i

= −β|φ1|2φ1 − kφ2 + iaφ2 + G1(φ1, φ2),
= −β|φ2|2φ2 − kφ1 − iaφ1 + G2(φ1, φ2), (20)
where G1(φ1, φ2) may be any linear or nonlinear term
that keeps the system to be conservative.
If one con-
siders the nonlinearities upto cubic order, then G1 and
G2 can be taken as cross phase modulation term where
G1 = |φ2|2φ1 and G2 = |φ1|2φ2 or they can also be taken

4

2φ∗1 and G2 = φ2

as G1 = φ2
1φ∗2. In all such cases, one can
ﬁnd similar dynamics as that of (1). The spontaneous
symmetry breaking is found to occur through pitchfork
type bifurcation and also the dynamics of these systems
are reciprocal. Thus it makes clear that all the conserva-
tive systems with linear PT coupling are reciprocal. So
we are interested to investigate whether the addition of
non-conservative nature to the system can induce non-
reciprocity.

3. ADDITION OF NON-CONSERVATIVE

NATURE

In this section, we investigate whether the addition
of terms leading to non-conservative nature of the sys-
tem can bring out non-reciprocal behavior to it. We
can introduce non-conservative nature into the system
through balanced loss-gain terms. But the presence of
non-reciprocal nature in such balanced loss-gain PT sym-
metric system is well known in the literature. Thus it
is not necessary to study the non-reciprocal nature in
the presence of loss-gain terms. Secondly one of the pri-
mary aims of the present work is to ﬁnd an alternative to
loss-gain systems. Thus we look for other types of non-
conservative terms such as four wave mixing and ﬁnd
whether such eﬀects can induce non-reciprocal nature in
the system.

For this purpose, we consider the system

= −β|φ1|2φ1 − kφ2 + iaφ2 + G1(φ1, φ2),
= −β|φ2|2φ2 − kφ1 − iaφ1 + G2(φ1, φ2), (21)
where the functions G1(φ1, φ2) and G2(φ1, φ2) may cor-
respond to non-conservative nonlinear interaction terms.
If one considers the nonlinearities upto cubic order, one
can ﬁnd the possible forms of G1(φ1, φ2) and G2(φ1, φ2)
as

G1(φ1, φ2) = α1φ2
G2(φ1, φ2) = α1φ2

1φ∗2 + α2|φ1|2φ2 + α3|φ2|2φ2,
2φ∗1 + α2|φ2|2φ1 + α3|φ1|2φ1.(22)

3.1. Case: α1 6= 0, α2 = α3 = 0

First we study the dynamics of the system (21) in the
presence of the four wave mixing term alone correspond-
ing to α1 6= 0 and α2 = α3 = 0. As we did in the
previous section, we substitute φ1(z) = R1ei(ωz+θ1) and
φ2(z) = R2ei(ωz+θ2) and ﬁnd the equations correspond-
ing to amplitude and phase diﬀerence which are given
by

˙R1 = (k + α1R2
˙R2 = −(k + α1R2

the unidirectional transport of light in the couplers. Figs.

The system in (21) with α1 6= 0, α2 = α3 = 0 has the
following constant of motion

C = β|φ1|2|φ2|2 − ia(φ1φ∗2 − φ∗1φ2) − k(φ1φ∗2 + φ∗1φ2),(26)

Consequently we have

C = βR2

ing on the eigenvalues given in Eq. (35), we ﬁnd that the
second term inside the square root is strongly positive,
so that the eigenvalues will be pure imaginary. The sym-
metric modes corresponding to this case are found to be
neutrally stable.

From (28), we can note that R2 can also take the form

The above results imply that the symmetric modes are
neutrally stable for almost all parameteric values. Al-
though the asymmetric modes have not been deduced in
the above, the numerical results conﬁrm the existence of
such solutions. However in the asymmetric mode case,
the frequency of φ1 and φ2 are diﬀerent, and so the above
analytical results fail to show their existence.

3.1.1. Non-reciprocal nature

Now we consider the reciprocal or non-reciprocal na-
ture of the system (21) with α1 6= 0, α2 = α3 = 0. In
this connection, we have plotted the beam propagtion
in both the unbroken and broken PT regions of system
(21) in Fig. 3. Note that Figs. 3(a)-(b) and 3(c)-(d) are
plotted respectively in the unbroken and broken regions
2 |2(0) = 0
2 |2(0) = 1, as mentioned in the
previous section. From Figs. 3(c) and 3(d), the asym-
metric transport of light in the waveguides become ob-
vious and in contrast to Figs. 2(c) and 2(d) here the
light is localized in the second waveguide independent

for the initial conditions (i) |φ(1)
(ii) |φ(2)

1 |2(0) = 0, |φ(2)

1 |2(0) = 1, |φ(1)

of the waveguide which is initially lightened. This type
of unidirectional propagation clearly ensures the non-
reciprocal nature of the system. Further to illustrate the
non-reciprocal nature in the unbroken and broken PT
regions, we have plotted Figs. 3(e) and 3(f). From these
ﬁgures it is obvious that |φ(i)
2 (z)|2, where
i, j ∈ 1, 2 and i 6= j, thus the non-conservative nature can
induce non-reciprocity in this linear PT coupled systems.
Knowing that the system (21) exhibits non-reciprocal
nature, we now look at how far it can isolate light in a
waveguide. For this purpose, we now consider the nor-
malized power diﬀerence given by

1 (z)|2 6= |φ(j)

Q =

P1 − P2
P1 + P2

,

(40)

where P1 (P2) represents the average of P1 (P2) with
respect to z. Here, P1 and P2 are P1 = |φ1|2 and
P2 = |φ2|2.
If Q is zero then the light is equally dis-
tributed in the ﬁrst and second waveguides so that there
occurs propagation of symmetric modes in the system.
Whenever Q takes the values 1 or −1, we can ﬁnd that
the light is well localized in one of the waveguides namely
the ﬁrst (while Q = 1) or second (while Q = −1) waveg-
uide.
If Q takes up intermediate values (−1 < Q < 0
and 0 < Q < 1) then there exists an asymmetric state
in which light is not localized completely in one of the
waveguides.

By ﬁxing the parameters as a = 0.5, k = 0.3, α1 = 1.0
and β = 2.5 (which lies in the broken PT region as
checked numerically), in Fig. 4(a) we plot Q with dif-
ferent input powers and also for diﬀerent input power
distributions, where the input power distributions are
characterized by

Q(0) =

P1(0) − P2(0)
P1(0) + P2(0)

,

(41)

where P1(0) and P2(0) represent the power given to
the ﬁrst and second waveguides initially and P1(0) +
P2(0) = P (0). Q(0) = 0 represents the symmetric in-
put power distribution, while other values of Q(0) repre-
sent the asymmetric distribution of input power among
the waveguides. From Fig. 4(a), one can ﬁnd that when
P (0) is small, the system remains in the symmetric state
(as Q = 0) for all values of Q(0). Increasing the total
input power P (0), one can ﬁnd in Fig. 4(a) that Q be-
comes zero only when the input power distribution is also
nearly symmetric (or near Q(0) = 0)and if the asymme-
try in the input power distribution is increased (that is,
if Q(0) is away from 0), the value of Q sharply jumps to
−1. In the latter case, we can also note in Fig. 4(a) that
the value of Q is −1 at both extremes of Q(0) represent-
ing the non-reciprocal nature of the system, whereas in
the reciprocal case Q = 1 in one extreme and Q = −1 in
the other extreme as shown in Fig. 1(b). This shows that
the system can be well used for unidirectional transport
of light.

However, for low input powers, the asymmetric modes
are not stable and in this region the linear modes come
into play. As these linear modes are stable for all para-
metric ranges, isolation of light cannot be achieved with
low input powers (as can be seen in Fig. 4(a)). This im-
plies that the above type of systems cannot be used for
low power applications. On the other hand in the PT
symmetric system with linear loss-gain, the linear modes
lose their stability with an increase of loss-gain strength
(as shown in Sec. 2). Thus the PT symmetric systems
with loss-gain may have an advantage during low power
applications, though balancing loss and gain in such sys-
tems may be an issue.

3.2. Other Cases:

We have also veriﬁed the existence of non-reciprocal
nature in the presence of other non-conservative terms
in Eq. (22) individually, that is we considered the cases
In
α2 6= 0, α1 = α3 = 0 and α3 6= 0, α1 = α2 = 0.
both these cases, we ﬁnd the existence of non-reciprocal
nature in the system. Thus one ﬁnds that the non-
conservative nature can induce non-reciprocal nature in
the systems with linear PT coupling. In Fig. 4(b), we
have shown how far the above discussed cases (i) α1 6= 0,
(also α2 = α3 = 0), (ii) α2 6= 0, (also α1 = α3 = 0)
and (iii) α3 6= 0, (also α1 = α2 = 0), found to be use-
ful in optical isolation. For these cases, we have plotted
the values of Q for diﬀerent Q(0), where Q and Q(0)
are given respectively in Eqs. (40) and (41). From Fig.
4(b), one can observe in all the three cases that around
Q(0) = 0, the system remains in symmetric state where
Q = 0. When the value of Q(0) departs more from 0, we
ﬁnd the appearance of asymmetric state corresponding
Q 6= 0. Fig. 4(b) also reveals that in the ﬁrst and third
cases mentioned above, we can note that the asymmetric
state is characterized by Q = −1.
In the second case
corresponding to α2 6= 0, Q reaches 1. This denotes that
in the ﬁrst and third cases, the light is isolated in the
second waveguide whereas in the second case, the light is
isolated in the ﬁrst waveguide. From Fig. 4(b) one can
also note that Q does not reach −1 fully in the third case,
which denotes that the system weakly localizes the light
in the second waveguide. Thus one may need a higher
value of β in order to achieve perfect isolation in the third
case.

Although in the above discussions, we demonstrated
the dynamics by introducing one by one of the terms
given in (22), we can also take the combination of these
terms. From Fig. 4(b) we can note that the terms cor-
responding to α1 and α3 has the capability to localize
light in the second waveguide and the term correspond-
ing to α2 has the capability to localize light in the ﬁrst
waveguide. Thus when α1 and α3 alone are set to be
non-zero, the localization of light occurs in the second
waveguide. If α2 is also made non-zero with other terms,
depending upon whether α2 is greater than or lesser than

7

the other quantities α1 and α3, localization in the ﬁrst
or second waveguide occurs. Note that,
in the situa-
tions (a) α1 = α2, α3 = 0, (b) α2 = α3, α1 = 0 and
(c) α1 = α3 = 1
2 α2 , the tendency of localizing light in
the ﬁrst waveguide cancels with the tendency of localiz-
ing light in the second waveguide. Thus these cases give
rise to reciprocal dynamics. One may also note that the
above three speciﬁc reciprocal cases correspond to con-
servative ones where the change in the total power of the
system (21) is given by

dP
dz

= (−α1 + α2 − α3)S2(P1 − P2),

(42)

where S2 is one of the Stokes’ variables (S2 = i(φ1φ∗2 −
φ∗1φ2)), P1 (= |φ1|2) and P2 (= |φ2|2) are the powers in
the ﬁrst and second waveguides.
In Figs. 4(c) and 4(d), we note the parametric re-
gions in which the unidirectional transport of light can
be achieved for the three particular cases mentioned ear-
lier by (i)-(iii). From Fig. 4(c), we note that the uni-
directional transport occurs only when the PT coupling
strength is low (but a 6= 0) and that the strength of
nonlinearity is suﬃciently large. In Fig. 4(d), we have
plotted such unidirectional transport regions in (β-αi)
space. From both the ﬁgures we can note that such uni-
directional region corresponding to the third case (iii)
α3 6= 0, α1 = α2 = 0 is not wider compared to the other
cases. From both these ﬁgures we can also note that the
parameter β plays an important role in inducing unidi-
rectional transport of light. Even the increase in αi’s is
not contributing much to the emergence of unidirectional
propagation region. Also one may ﬁnd that at β = 0, the
unidirectional transport of light is absent. The lack of
localizing nature of nonlinear interaction terms αi’s may
be the reason for the absence of such dynamics at β = 0.
In this connection, we note the necessity of the self-
trapping nonlinearity for the unidirectional transport of
light. We expect that the absence of self-trapping non-
linearity only suppresses the localization of light in one
of the waveguides. However, the dynamics of the system
is expected to be non-reciprocal. But our observation
shows that the absence of self-trapping nonlinearity not
only impacts the localization of light but also the non-
reciprocal nature of the system. More clearly, in the case
β = 0 we expect the beam propagation in the waveg-
uide follows the form shown in Fig. 3(e) where we have
pointed out the non-reciprocal propagation of light when
the symmetry is unbroken. But the system actually ex-
hibits a reciprocal propagation as in Fig. 2(e). This
shows that the self-trapping nonlinearity also has the im-
portant role in the suppression of time reversibility which
results in non-reciprocal dynamics.

The above discussion shows that to induce non-
reciprocity in systems with linear PT coupling, in ad-
dition to the presence of PT term, we also need localiz-
ing nonlinearity and non-conservative nature where the
localizing nonlinearity need not be the self-trapping non-
linearity and it is any nonlinearity that is capable of lo-

calizing energy.

To verify the above, we have included some quintic
conservative and non-conservative nonlinearities to the
system. For example, for conservative quintic nonlinear-
ities one may consider

G1(φ1, φ2) = α4|φ1|2|φ2|2φ1 + α5|φ1|2|φ2|2φ2

+α6|φ1|4φ1 + α7|φ2|4φ1

G2(φ1, φ2) = α4|φ2|2|φ1|2φ2 + α5|φ2|2|φ1|2φ1

+α6|φ2|4φ2 + α7|φ1|4φ2

(43)

(44)

Similar to the earlier cases, by introducing each nonlin-
earities one by one, we can ﬁnd the reciprocal behavior in
all these conservative systems. For the non-conservative
nonlinearities, we can take the forms

(In (43)-(46), the quantities αi, i = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, are con-
stant parameters). With the introduction of the above
terms one by one, we can ﬁnd that these cases behave
similar to the non-conservative cases discussed earlier.
The above mentioned nonlinearities also do not have lo-
calizing nature by themselves so they show non-reciprocal
dynamics only in the presence of self-trapping nonlinear-
ity, namely β mentioned in (21).

Now we turn to the cases with nonlinear PT interac-

tion,

= −β|φ1|2φ1 − kφ2 + iG1(φ1, φ2),
= −β|φ2|2φ2 − kφ1 − iG2(φ1, φ2),

(47)

where the last term denotes the nonlinear PT coupling.
The G1(φ1, φ2) and G2(φ1, φ2) terms can be chosen as
any one of the nonlinearities given below,

G1(φ1, φ2) = (η1|φ1|2φ2 + η2|φ2|2φ2 + η3|φ2|2φ1),(48)
G2(φ1, φ2) = (η1|φ2|2φ1 + η2|φ1|2φ1 + η3|φ1|2φ2).(49)
where η1, η2 and η3 are constant parameters. The above
nonlinearly PT coupled system includes both conserva-
tive and disspative terms, where the change in the total
power of the system is

dP
dz

= (η1 − η2)(P1 − P2)S1

(50)

Here S1 is one of the Stokes’ variables, S1 = φ1φ∗2 +
φ∗1φ2. Thus the cases η1 6= 0, η2 = 0 and η2 6= 0, η1 = 0
belong to the non-conservative cases. While looking at
the dynamics of these non-conservative systems, we ﬁnd
that it is qualitatively similar to the non-conservative

cases that were discussed in the previous section. Here
also one can ﬁnd that the absence of localizing nonlin-
earity switches oﬀ the non-reciprocal nature.

The interesting point that can be observed from this
nonlinear PT coupling case is that it liberates the neces-
sity of non-conservative nature for the presence of non-
reciprocity. The above case η3 6= 0, η1 = η2 = 0 is
a conservative case that evidences the existence of non-
reciprocity. To prove this let us focus on the equation

i ˙φ1 = −β|φ1|2φ1 − kφ2 + iη3|φ2|2φ1,
i ˙φ2 = −β|φ2|2φ2 − kφ1 − iη3|φ1|2φ2.

(51)

(52)

First let us study the dynamics and non-reciprocal na-
ture of the system. For this purpose the equations cor-
responding to the amplitude and phase diﬀerence of the
system are

˙R1 = kR2 sin δ + η3R1R2
2,
˙R2 = −kR1 sin δ − η3R2
1R2,
˙δ = (βR1R2 − k cos δ)(R2

1 − R2
2).

(53)

(54)

(55)

From the conservative nature of the system, we can
reduce the order of the above equation through the sub-
1. Thus the above equations

stitution of R2 = pP − R2

will reduce to

˙R1 = (k sin δ + η3R1qP − R2
˙δ = (βR1qP − R2
1 − k cos δ)

While tracing out the stationary modes of light corre-

where cos δ∗ =

ﬁnd that these asymmetric modes exist only when β2 +

By analyzing the stability of each one of the modes,
one can ﬁnd that the eigenvalues corresponding to the
symmetric and asymmetric modes are

M1 : λ = ±irq4k2 − P 2η2
M2 : λ = ±irq4k2 − P 2η2

From the above, one can ﬁnd that the symmetric mode

the other symmetric mode (M2) is neutrally stable only

−P 2η2

besides η3 < 2k

when β <

eigenvalues of the asymmetric modes M3 and M4, the
mode M3 is stable for β2 + η2
P 2 whereas the mode
M4 is unstable for all values of parameters.

3 > 4k2

The regions in which each of the modes are stable are
given in Fig. 5. The ﬁgure clearly shows that the increase
in either β or η3 leads to the stabilization of asymmet-
ric ﬁxed points which leads to spontaneous symmetry
breaking. Also the bifurcation that stabilizes the asym-
metric mode is like tangent bifurcation where the bifur-
cation gives rise to two stationary modes (M3 and M4)
with opposite stabilities. A closer look at such bifurca-
tion of asymmetric ﬁxed points reveals that it denotes
the emergence of non-reciprocal nature. This is because
that unlike the earlier conservative cases discussed in
Sec. II, here only one of the asymmetric modes M3 with
R∗1 > R∗2 is stable (where the power in the ﬁrst and sec-
2 and
ond waveguides are related to R∗1 and R∗2 as P1 = R∗1

9

2). This implies that independent of whether the
P2 = R∗2
input power is given in the ﬁrst or second waveguide, M3
becomes stable and gives rise to localization of light in
the ﬁrst waveguide. In the earlier conservative cases both
the asymmetric modes are stable and depending on the
input power distribution, the light is localized in one of
the waveguides. Thus the above results show the uni-
directional propagation of light or nonreciprocal nature
of light in the present case. One can also ﬁnd that the
dynamics of the system in both the unbroken and broken
regions resemble that of the one shown in Fig. 3 except
for the conservative nature of the present system.

Also it is clear from Fig. 5 that the non-reciprocal
nature arises even in the case β = 0. As the nonlinear
coupling η3 itself has the ability to localize energy, the
non-reciprocal nature appears even while β = 0. This
makes clear that the necessary elements needed to induce
non-reciprocity in systems with nonlinear PT coupling is
the localizing nonlinearity.

5. SUMMARY

In this article, we have considered a class of PT sym-
metric systems where the coupling is responsible for the
PT nature. With such systems, we studied their dy-
namics in comparison to PT symmetric systems with
loss-gain. Importantly, we investigated the necessary el-
ements needed for the non-reciprocal nature of the sys-
tem. Our results show that the elements needed for non-
reciprocity in diﬀerent PT -symmetric situations are the
following.

1. PT system with loss-gain : Always non-reciprocal.
However, designing equal gain and loss is the main
diﬃculty.

2. Systems with linear PT coupling : PT term +
localizing nonlinearity + non-conservativeness →
non-reciprocity.

3. Systems with nonlinear PT coupling : PT term +

localizing nonlinearity → non-reciprocity.

The above conclusions show that the presence of non-
reciprocity in this class of coupled waveguide systems
depends strongly on the presence of localizing nonlinear-
ity. We have also indicated how far the systems can be
used in applications. Further, the eﬀorts to engineer such
models with gyro-magnetic materials and the experimen-
tal observation on light localization in such models may
reveal the adaptability and applicability of these models.
