PLETHYSTIC IDENTITIES AND MIXED HODGE STRUCTURES

OF CHARACTER VARIETIES

ANTON MELLIT

Abstract. I demonstrate how certain identities for Macdonald’s polynomials
established by Garsia, Haiman and Tesler, together with the conjecture of Hausel,
Letellier and Villegas imply explicit relations between mixed Hodge polynomials
of diﬀerent character varieties.

1. Symmetric functions

The set of all partitions is denoted P and we have the following symmetric func-

tions for each n ∈ Z>0, λ ∈ P, say in the variables x1, x2, . . ..

We set h0 = e0 = 1. p0 is undeﬁned.

The ring of symmetric functions is denoted by Sym and over Q it is just the

polynomial ring in the variables p1, p2, . . ..

All our rings are commutative and contain Q.

2. λ-rings

Deﬁnition 2.1. A λ-ring (over Q) is a ring R endowed with the following operation.
For each x ∈ R and F ∈ Sym we have F [x] ∈ Sym in such a way that

(i) For each x ∈ R the map F → F [x] is a ring homomorphism from Sym to

R.

(ii) For each n ∈ Z>0 the map x → pn[x] from R to R is a ring homomorphism.
(iii) We have pm[pn[x]] = pmn[x] and p1[x] = x for each m, n ∈ Z>0 and x ∈ R.

Remark 2.1. Equivalently, we could deﬁne a λ-ring to be a ring together with a
family of commuting ring homomorphisms p2, p3, . . . indexed by prime numbers.

Example 2.1. We endow the polynomial ring Q[x1, x2, . . . , xk] with the standard λ-
structure by the rule pn[xi] = xn
for each n ∈ Z>0 and i = 1, 2, . . . , k. Similarly
i
for the rings of rational functions, power series and Laurent power series, or rings
of mixed type, i.e. rings like Q(q, t)[x1, x2, . . .]. It is common to consider only λ-
rings with the standard λ-structure and call the operation F → F [x] plethystic
substitution.

Example 2.2. Any ring R can be endowed with the stupid λ-structure by setting
pn[x] = x for all n ∈ Z>0.

Deﬁnition 2.2. An element x in a λ-ring R is called monomial if pn[x] = xn for
each n ∈ Z>0.

Monomial elements possess the following properties, which are easily veriﬁed for

power sums and then extended to all symmetric functions.

Proposition 2.1. For a sequence of monomial elements x1, x2, . . . in a λ-ring R
and any symmetric function F we have

F [x1 + x2 + · · · ] = F (x1, x2, . . .).

On the left hand side we apply the operation F [−] to the element x1 + x2 + · · · , while
on the right hand side we view F as a polynomial and evaluate it on x1, x2, . . ..

Proposition 2.2. For a monomial element u ∈ R, any F ∈ Sym homogeneous of
degree d, and X ∈ R we have

F [uX] = udF [X].

Deﬁnition 2.3 (Free λ-rings). The free λ-ring in generators X1, X2, . . . , Xk will be
denoted Sym[X1, X2, . . . , Xk].
It is simply the k-th tensor power of Sym. It can
be thought of as the ring of symmetric functions in k sets of variables. Capital
letters X, Y, Z, W are reserved to denote arbitrary elements in arbitrary λ-rings,
or equivalently, generators of free λ-rings. This is contrary to small letters, which
will denote elements with special properties with respect to the λ-structure, usually
monomial elements.

PLETHYSTIC IDENTITIES AND MIXED HODGE STRUCTURES OF CHARACTER VARIETIES3

Proposition 2.3 (Basic identities). For each n ∈ Z≥0, we have

hn[X + Y ] =

nXi=0

hn[−X] = (−1)nen[X],

hi[X]hn−i[Y ],

en[X + Y ] =

hn[XY ] =Xλ⊢n

hλ[X]mλ[Y ].

ei[X]en−i[Y ],

nXi=0

2.1. Examples of computations. We ﬁrst evaluate en[k] for each k ∈ Z>0. By
Proposition 2.1 we have

Consider Q[x] with the stupid λ-ring structure pi[x] = x. Then en[x] must be a

n(cid:19).
en[k] = en(1, 1, . . . , 1) = #{1 ≤ i1 < · · · < in ≤ k} =(cid:18)k
n(cid:1) for each x = k ∈ Z>0. Therefore

x(x − 1) · · · (x − k + 1)

(pi[x] = x).

k!

Now let’s take R = Q(q, u) with the standard λ-structure pi[q] = qi, pi[u] = ui

(1)

1 − u

1 − u

On the other hand

polynomial which agrees with(cid:0)k
n(cid:19) =
en[x] =(cid:18)x
1−qi. On one hand we have
and try to evaluate enh 1−u
en(cid:20) 1 − uq
1 − q(cid:21) = qnen(cid:20)1 − u
1 − q (cid:21) = en(cid:20)1 + q
1 − q(cid:21) = en(cid:20) 1 − u
1 − q (cid:21) = en(cid:20)u +
en(cid:20) 1 − uq
1 − q(cid:21) = · · · =
1 − q(cid:21) =
en−1(cid:20) 1 − u
en(cid:20) 1 − u
hn(cid:20) 1 − u
1 − q(cid:21) = (−1)nunen(cid:20) 1 − u−1
1 − q (cid:21) =
n(cid:19)q
2)(cid:18)k
q − 1(cid:21) = q(n

en(cid:20) qk − 1

We can also compute

qn−1 − u
1 − qn

Thus we have

(2)

.

1 − q(cid:21) + qn−1en−1(cid:20) 1 − u
1 − q(cid:21) .
1 − q(cid:21) + uen−1(cid:20)1 − u
1 − q(cid:21) .

(1 − u) · · · (qn−1 − u)
(1 − q) · · · (1 − qn)

.

(1 − u) · · · (1 − uqn−1)

(1 − q) · · · (1 − qn)

We can make a substitution u = qk because qk is monomial and obtain

For q = 1 this also gives the classical binomial coeﬃcient. We see that diﬀerent
deformations of the classical binomial coeﬃcients are simply evaluations of en in
diﬀerent λ-rings.

ANTON MELLIT

Remark 2.2. This example also illustrates the fact that one cannot do arbitrary
substitutions in λ-ring identities. For instance, if a formula is proved under the
assumption pi[q] = qi on can only do substitutions q = a such that a also satisﬁes
pi[a] = ai. Thus (2) is true if we replace q by 1, or 0, or q−1, but not something
completely random. Similarly, we cannot set x = q in (1). On the other hand,
if we have an identity with free variables, like the ones in Proposition 2.3, we can
substitute arbitrary values.

Deﬁnition 3.1.

3. Plethystic exponential

Exp[X] :=

hn[X] = exp  ∞Xn=1

∞Xn=0

pn[X]

n ! .

The series is understood in the completion of Sym[X] with respect to the degree.

Several properties are immediate from Proposition 2.3.

Proposition 3.1. We have

Exp[X + Y ] = Exp[X] Exp[Y ],

Exp[XY ] =Xλ∈P

hλ[X]mλ[Y ].

Remark 3.1. If x is such that pn[x] = 0 for n > 1, then the plethystic exponential
becomes the usual exponential:

Exp[x] = exp(x).

If k is such that pn[k] = k for all n, then for any X

Exp[kX] = (Exp[X])k.

For monomial x1, x2, . . . , xn we have

Exp" nXi=1

xi# =

nYi=1

1

1 − xi

.

The operation Exp can be inverted. The inverse operation is called plethystic

logarithm and is denoted by Log. It is deﬁned for series with constant term 1.

3.1. Hall pairing. The exponential is related to the Hall pairing.

Deﬁnition 3.2. The Hall pairing (−, −) is the unique scalar product on Sym such
that {hλ}, {mλ} form dual bases.

PLETHYSTIC IDENTITIES AND MIXED HODGE STRUCTURES OF CHARACTER VARIETIES5

Then Exp[XY ] is the reproducing kernel for the Hall pairing. This means the

following

Proposition 3.2 (Reproducing kernel identity). For any F [X] ∈ Sym[X] we have

(F [X], Exp[XY ])X = F [Y ].

The subscript X means we take the scalar product with respect to X. A conse-

quence of this fact is that for any pair of dual bases {aλ}, {bλ} we have

Exp[XY ] =Xλ

aλ[X]bλ[Y ].

3.2. Coproduct. Perhaps a more conceptual way to understand the Hall product
is through the Hopf algebra structure.

Deﬁnition 3.3. The coproduct on Sym[X] is deﬁned in the following way. We have

∆ : Sym[X] → Sym[X] ⊗ Sym[X] ∼= Sym[X, Y ]

(∆F )[X, Y ] = F [X + Y ].

The coproduct is dual to the product in the following way:

Proposition 3.3. For each F, G, G′ ∈ Sym[X] we have

(F [X], G[X]G′[X])X = (F [X + Y ], G[X]G′[Y ])X,Y .

Proof. For any F we can write

F [X] = (Exp[XZ], F [Z])Z.

We substitute this in the right hand side of the identity we need to prove and obtain

((Exp[(X + Y )Z], F [Z])Z, G[X]G′[Y ])X,Y = (G[Z]G′[Z], F [Z])Z

by computing the scalar product with respect to X and Y .

(cid:3)

This can be pictured as follows:

G

G′

·

F

=

∆

G′

Finally an important property is

Proposition 3.4. For F, G ∈ Sym[X] we have

(F [XY ], G[X])X = (F [X], G[XY ])X .

6

ANTON MELLIT

Proof. Similar to Proposition 3.3

(cid:3)

4. Macdonald polynomials

Denote by M≤λ the subspace of Sym spanned by mµ for µ ≤ λ with respect to
the dominance order. Schur polynomials can be identiﬁed up to a scalar factor by
the properties

sλ[X] ∈ M≤λ,

sλ[−X] ∈ M≤λ′,

where λ′ denotes the conjugate partition. The Macdonald polynomials can be de-
ﬁned similarly. From now on Sym will be the symmetric functions over the ﬁeld
Q(q, t) with the standard λ-structure.

Deﬁnition 4.1 ([GH96]). Macdonald polynomials1 Hλ ∈ Sym are unique polyno-
mials such that

Hλ[(t − 1)X] ∈ M≤λ,

Hλ[(q − 1)X] ∈ M≤λ′,

Hλ[1] = 1.

Example 4.1. Directly from the deﬁnition we deduce the two special cases

It follows that if we deﬁne the Macdonald scalar product as follows

(F [X], G[X])∗ := (F [X], G[QX])

Q = (q − 1)(1 − t)

the Macdonald polynomials become orthogonal with respect to the Macdonald scalar
product. Let

αλ := (Hλ, Hλ)∗ =Ya,l

(qa − tl+1)(qa+1 − tl),

where the product runs over the arm- and leg-lengths of the hooks of λ.

1Usually these polynomials are denoted eHλ. We omit the tilde from the notation.

From the deﬁning property of the Schur functions we deduce specializations

H(n)[X] =

H1n[X] =

hnh X
1−qi
hnh 1
1−qi ,
hn(cid:2) X
1−t(cid:3)

en(cid:2) X
t−1(cid:3) =

sλh 1

Hλ[X]|t=q−1 =

(λ ∈ P).

PLETHYSTIC IDENTITIES AND MIXED HODGE STRUCTURES OF CHARACTER VARIETIES7

The reproducing kernel for the Macdonald scalar product is the element

Exp(cid:20) XY

Q (cid:21) =Xλ∈P

Hλ[X]Hλ[Y ]

5. HLV conjecture

Deﬁne for each k = 1, 2, 3, . . .

Hλ[X1]Hλ[X2] · · · Hλ[Xk]

.

Ω[X1, . . . , Xk] :=Xλ∈P
Ω[X1, . . . , Xk] = Exp(cid:20) H[X1, X2, . . . , Xk]

αλ

Q

Also deﬁne H by the formula

(cid:21) .

The genus 0 version of the conjecture of Hausel, Letellier and Rodriguez-Villegas is

Conjecture (HLV, genus 0). All coeﬃcients of the series H are polynomials in q
and t, and for each tuple of partitions λ(1), λ(2),. . . ,λ(k) the scalar product

H(hλ(1), . . . , hλ(k)) := (H[X1, . . . , Xk], hλ(1)[X1] · · · hλ(k)[Xk])X1,...,Xk

coincides with the mixed Hodge polynomial of the moduli space of local systems on
P1 with k punctures whose local monodromies around the punctures are ﬁxed diag-
onalizable conjugacy classes of types λ(1), λ(2),. . . ,λ(k) satsifying certain genericity
condition.

The precise formulation can be found in [HLRV11].

Remark 5.1. We have the following identity.

H[X1, . . . , Xk, 1] = H[X1, . . . , Xk]

Remark 5.2. We have H[X1, X2] = X1X2.

Deﬁnition 5.1. The Macdonald coproduct ∆′ is deﬁned by

∆′Hλ = Hλ ⊗ Hλ

(λ ∈ P).

Remark 5.3. We can obtain Ω by iterated application of the Macdonald coproduct
starting from the case k = 1.

6. Plethystic identities

The purpose of this section is to demonstrate some techniques in dealing with
Macdonald polynomials. There are several works studying plethystic identities re-
lated to the Macdonald polynomials. The most important identity, from which every
other identity can be easily deduced seems to be the following:

Theorem 6.1 ([GHT99], Theorem I.3). Let ∇, T, T ∗ : Sym → Sym be the operators

∇Hλ = Hλ[−1] · Hλ,

(T F )[X] = F [X + 1],

Let V be the composition

V := ∇T ∗T.

For each partition λ deﬁne the generating functions

(T ∗F )[X] = Exp(cid:20) X

Q(cid:21) F [X].

Then

qctr,

Bλ := Xr,c∈λ
Q (cid:21)
V (Hλ) = Exp(cid:20) DλX

Dλ := −1 − QBλ.

(λ ∈ P).

Remark 6.1. The operators T , T ∗ are conjugate with respect to the Macdonald
scalar product.

Remark 6.2. Our operator ∇ diﬀers from the original one by the sign (−1)|λ|. This
choice is made in order to eliminate the operators −(·) and ω from our notation,
because they interact poorly with plethystic substitution.

Remark 6.3. The theorem implies that V transforms the Macdonald coproduct to
the usual coproduct:

∆′

V

V

=

V

∆

Another interesting statement can be obtained by conjugation:

Proposition 6.2. For each F ∈ Sym let ∆F be the operator

∆F : Sym → Sym

∆F Hλ = F [Dλ]Hλ.

PLETHYSTIC IDENTITIES AND MIXED HODGE STRUCTURES OF CHARACTER VARIETIES9

Let MF be the operator of multiplication by F . Then

where V ∗ = T ∗T ∇ is the operator conjugate to V .

V ∗MF = ∆F V ∗,

Proof. One way to see this is to mentally conjugate the pictures above. A more
explicit way is to write both sides in the Macdonald basis. For each λ, µ ∈ P

(V ∗(F Hλ), Hµ)∗ = F [Dµ]Hλ[Dµ],

(∆F V ∗Hλ, Hµ)∗ = F [Dµ](V ∗Hλ, Hµ)∗ = F [Dµ]Hλ[Dµ].

(cid:3)

Another statement is an interesting symmetry:

Proposition 6.3 (Macdonald-Koornwinder duality). Consider

Exp[uBλ] Hλ[1 + uDµ] =

,

Hλ[1 + uDµ]

Qr,c∈λ(1 − uqctr)

where u is a new monomial variable. This expression is symmetric in λ, µ ∈ P.

Proof. It is equivalent to symmetry of the following expression:

We notice that this can be written as

Exp(cid:20) uDµ
(cid:18)T ∗T Hλ, Exp(cid:20) uXDµ
Q (cid:21)(cid:19)∗

Q (cid:21) Hλ[1 + uDµ].

= ((T ∗T Hλ)[X], (∇T ∗T Hµ)[uX])∗ .

Since ∇ preserves the degree of symmetric functions and is self-adjoint, the last
expression is symmetric in µ and λ.

(cid:3)

Setting µ = () we obtain

Corollary 6.4.

Hλ[1 − u] = Exp[−uBλ] = Yr,c∈λ

(1 − uqctr)

(λ ∈ P).

In the limit u → ∞ we obtain

Corollary 6.5.

Hλ[−1] = (−1)|λ| Yr,c∈λ

qctr = (−1)|λ|qn(λ′)tn(λ)

(λ ∈ P).

10

7. An interesting bijection

In view of Corollary 6.4 is seems natural to evaluate Ω on arguments of type 1 − u

where u is monomial. Consider

A := Ω[X, 1 − y1, 1 − y2, . . . , 1 − yk],

αλ

i=1 yi. By Corollary 6.4 we can

write it as

where y1, y2, . . . are monomial variables. Set Y =Pk
Q(cid:21)Xλ∈P

A =Xλ∈P

Hλ[X] Exp[−BλY ]

Hλ[X] Exph DλY
Q i
Thus to obtain the sum on the right we simply need to apply V to Exph XY
respect to the variable Y . Since Exph XY
A = Exp(cid:20) Y

= Exp(cid:20) Y
Q i with
Q i is the reproducing kernel, or simply by a
Q(cid:21) V ∗ Exp(cid:20) XY
Q (cid:21) .

direct computation we see that the result will be the same if we apply the conjugate
operator V ∗ with respect to the variable X:

αλ

.

Applying ∇ to Exph XY

directly:

Q i we obtain Ω[X, Y, −1], and then T and T ∗ can be computed
A = Exp(cid:20) X + Y

Q (cid:21) Ω[X + 1, Y, −1].
Ω[X, 1 − y1, 1 − y2, . . . , 1 − yk] = Exp(cid:20) X + Y

Q (cid:21) Ω[X + 1, Y, −1].

Thus we have

This is convenient because now Q · Log[−] can be taken from both sides.

H[X, 1 − y1, 1 − y2, . . . , 1 − yk] = X + Y + H[X + 1, Y, −1].

For any symmetric function F and monomial u we have

(−1)jujhiej! ,
F [1 − u] = (F [X], Exp[X(1 − u)]) = F,
∞Xi,j=0
(−1)iei! ,

F [−1] = F,

(F [X + 1], hλ[X]) = (F [X], Exp[X]hλ[X]) = F,

∞Xi=0

So we can interpret our result in the following way

hλ,i! .

∞Xi=0

Theorem 7.1. For each pair of partitions λ, µ such that 1 ≤ µ1 ≤ |λ| ≤ |µ| we
have

H(hλ, h|λ|−µ1eµ1 , . . . , h|λ|−µkeµk ) = H(hλ,|µ|−|λ|, hµ, e|µ|).

An interesting special case is µ = 1k. Because e1 = h1 we obtain a somewhat

simpler looking identity:

Corollary 7.2. For integers k ≥ n ≥ 1 and λ ⊢ n we have

H(hλ, hn−1,1, . . . , hn−1,1

) = H(hλ,k−n, h1k , ek).

This work was presented at the workshop “Arithmetic aspects of moduli spaces”,
held in 2016 at the Bernoulli center, Lausanne. During the talk T. Hausel pointed
out that Corollary 7.2 solves a conjecture from their recent work [HMW16]. In their
work the statement of Corollary 7.2 is interpreted as the Laplace transform of wild
character varieties.
