We investigate van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures made of germanene, stanene or silicene with
hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN). The intriguing topological properties of these buckled honeycomb
materials can be maintained and further engineered in the heterostructures, where the competition
between the substrate eﬀect and external electric ﬁelds can be used to control the tunable topological
phase transitions. Using such heterostructures as building blocks, various vdW topological domain
walls (DW) are designed, along which there exist valley polarized quantum spin Hall edge states or
valley-contrasting edge states which are protected by valley(spin)- resolved topological charges and
can be tailored by the patterning of the heterojunctions and by external ﬁelds.

INTRODUCTION

Two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb layered materials
and their designer van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures
have attracted tremendous interest in material science
and condensed matter physics since the mechanical ex-
foliation of graphene from graphite [1]. In such kind of
honeycomb materials, besides real spin, valley (K or K(cid:48))
and sublattice (A or B) provide other tunable binary de-
grees of freedom to engineer their electronic properties,
such as the remarkable quantum X (X=anomalous, spin
and valley) Hall eﬀects [2–13]. Among these novel 2D
honeycomb materials, silicene, germanene, and stanene
with stable buckled honeycomb structures [14–16] are
attractive, and are predicted as the simplest elemental
quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators with sizable bulk
gaps especially [16, 17]. So far, lots of theoretical ef-
forts have been devoted to engineer their novel elec-
tronic properties by various means, eg. with conﬁne-
ment [18], electric ﬁeld [19–22], magnetic ﬁeld [23], ex-
change ﬁeld [11, 12, 22, 24, 25], light ﬁelds [26], domain
walls [10, 25] and chemical modiﬁcations [27]. In addi-
tion, there are several theoretical studies on the substrate
eﬀects for these 2D materials, such as on graphene [28],
hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) [29–31], and between
bilayer graphene [32] etc., whereas the impacts of the
substrates on the topological properties are seldomly ad-
dressed.

On the experimental side, the three honeycomb mate-
rials have been synthesized on various substrates. For ex-
ample silicene has been epitaxially grown on Ag(111) [33–
37], Zr2B2(0001) [38], Ir(111) [39], Au(110) [40] and
MoS2 substrates [41]. Germanene has been manufac-
tured on Pt(111) [42], Au(111) [43] and Al(111) [44]
substrates.
Stanene have recently been prepared on
Bi2Te3(0001) [45] and in liquid ambience [46]. However
on these substrates, the 2D honeycomb layers are prone
to form various crystallographic reconstructions, with
structures diﬀerent from their pristine forms. On the
other hand, their distinct electronic properties around
the Fermi
level and their topological properties may

be destroyed due to the hybridization with the sub-
strates [47]. Hence, it is crucial to ﬁnd high-quality sub-
strates that can stabilize these 2D materials and protest
their novel topological properties, further to enable the
engineering of their topological properties in simple and
feasible manners.

In this paper, based on density functional theory
(DFT) and model analysis, we investigate two kinds
of heterostructures of germanene, silicene and stanene
monolayers and h-BN as well as domain walls (DWs) be-
tween diﬀerent heterostructures. We ﬁnd a new univer-
sal mechanism that in these buckled materials the com-
petition and synergy between the substrate eﬀect, het-
erostructures pattern and electric ﬁelds can be used to
tune the topological phase transitions. Our results show
that the h-BN substrate has little hybridization with the
host materials. For symmetric heterostructures, the h-
BN encapsulation protect the atomic structures and the
electronic properties of germanene and stanenep, partic-
ularly maintaining their nontrivial bandgaps. For asym-
metric structures, the eﬀect of the h-BN substrate is to
provide an eﬀective staggered potential which could be
compensated by an external electric ﬁeld. Furthermore,
we propose realizations of novel valley polarized QSH
edge states based on a helical DW between an asym-
metric heterostructure and a symmetric one, and valley-
contrasting edge states along a DW between two inverse
asymmetric heterostructures. The topological properties,
such as valley and spin index, as well as the directional-
ity and the numbers of the edge states are protected by
topological charges and can be tailored by the patterning
of heterojuctions and the external ﬁelds. Devices with
such tunable disspationless topological edge states have
potential applications in spintroincs and valleytronics.

The DFT calculations are performed using the projec-
tor augmented wave method implemented in VASP [48].
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof parametrization of the gener-
alized gradient approximation (GGA-PBE) is used for
the exchange correlation potential [49, 50]. The energy
cutoﬀ of the plane wave basis is set to 500 eV and a
5 × 5 × 1 kpoints mesh is used. The supercell structure

asymmetric ones.

was optimized until the force on each atom was less than
0.01eV/˚A and with the vdW correction (DFT-D2) [53].
We then use an iterative method [54] to obtain the sur-
face Green’s functions of DW systems, from which we
calculate the dispersions of the topological edge states.

Asymmetric and symmetric heterostructures

Two types of heterostructures consisting of the host
materials (silicene, germanene, stanene) and the h-BN
substrate are taken into account. One is asymmetric het-
erostructures made of the hosts on the h-BN substrate
(Fig. 1(a)). Their geometry and corresponding interlayer
distances are determined by employing the atomic struc-
ture optimization with the vdW corrections (DFT-D2).
Their interlayer distances and binding energies are given
in Table I, which are comparable to the interlayer dis-
tances and binding energies of the typical vdW materi-
als; for instance 12 meV/˚A2 in graphite and 26 meV/˚A2
in MoS2 [55, 56]. Therefore these heterostructures are
vdW-type structures. Our band structure calculations
show the bands of h-BN substrate are far from the Fermi
level, hence the h-BN substrate does not hybrid with the
relevant low-energy levels of the hosts, but opens a trivial
gap at the Dirac point without SOC. Moreover, accord-
ing to our calculation, with more layers of h-BN under
these host materials, the band gap will not change too
much (∼1meV), so we use a monolayer of h-BN as the
substrate and the results could apply to the case of the
several layers substrate.

that the bands around Fermi level come from germanene
(red)(Fig. 2(a)), and the bands of h-BN (blue) are far

from Fermi level. As aforementioned, the two original
Dirac points K and K(cid:48) with a gap about 44.6 meV are
folded onto Γ point. And when we remove h-BN out of
the system, the proﬁle of band structures will not change
except for the gap closed in the freestanding germanene
demonstrating that the role of the substrate will exerts
the hosts a staggered potential. To understand the ori-
gin of the staggered potential, we calculate the potential
energy distribution along z direction (Fig. 2(d)). In the
buckled germanene, the A and B sublattices feel diﬀerent
potential, responsible for a staggered potential. Because
of breaking the inversion symmetry, the double degen-
eracy of the SOC band gap is lifted (Fig. 2(c)). From
Fig. 2(e), the staggered potential can be counteracted by
applying a perpendicular electric ﬁeld of about 0.45 V/˚A,
that means the h-BN substrate is equivalent to provid-
ing a perpendicular external electric ﬁeld of -0.45 V/˚A.
Without SOC, the band gap varies with a perpendicular
external electric ﬁeld in a V shape, and centered at 0.45
V/˚A. For the SOC case, we give a phase diagram, where
topological phase transitions occur twice. The band gap
varies with the electric ﬁeld in a W shape, and also cen-
tered at 0.45 V/˚A. Around the center of the W are QSH
insulators, whereas far from the center are band insula-
tors.

(i) Same as (d) but for the symmetric heterostructures. There are almost the same potential at A and B sublattices. (j) Same
as (e) but for the symmetric ones.

The other is symmetric heterostructures, which has a
sandwich structure by intercalating these hosts into the
bilayer h-BN, plotted in Fig. 1(b). Since the A and B
sublattices of germanene feel almost the same potential
energy in such symmetric sandwich structure (Fig. 2(i))
unlike the asymmetric one, it is expected that its band
strucutre is almost gapless when SOC is not taken into
account (Fig. 2(g)), and has a similar sizable SOC gap for
SOC case (Fig. 2(h)) as that of the pristine germanene.
In the phase diagram (Fig. 2(j)), it also has the similar
W shape or V shape electric ﬁeld response curves with
or without SOC as the above asymmetric heterostruc-
tures case, but with the centers shifted slightly from the
zero electric ﬁeld. These features are almost the same as
the pristine germanene. The advantages of the sandwich
structure are that it is not only stabilize the atomic geom-
etry of the host materials but also protect the intriguing
electronic properties from the undesired inﬂuence of the
substrates.

The physics of the two types of asymmetric and sym-
metric heterostructures can be captured by a TB lattice

model [16, 22],

The ﬁrst term is the nearest hopping term, and the sec-

two terms are the staggered potential due to h-BN sub-
strates and an external electric ﬁeld. These parame-
ters for the asymmetric heterostructures are ﬁtted with
DFT band structures, as given in Table I. As plotted in
Fig. 2(f) for germanene, the TB ﬁtting with DFT agrees
with each other very well for both cases of SOC or not.
And for the symmetric heterostructures, it is a good ap-
proximation taking Uh−BN as zero.

We are interested in the low-energy physics and con-
sider the eﬀects of the h-BN on the host materials eﬀec-
tively providing a staggered potential for pristine them.
Hence we expand the TB Hamiltonian surrounding the
two valley K and K(cid:48), and obtain the low-energy eﬀective

Topological domain walls

We propose two novel topological DW systems that can
be considered as composite horizonal heterostructures, as
illustrated in Fig. 3(a)(d). One consists of the above
asymmetric and symmetric heterostructures, and the
other consists of the two inverse asymmetric heterostruc-
tures. By exploiting the surface Green method [68],
we plot the spectra for the both zigzag DW systems.
Notice that the following analysis from the topological
view is not limited to the zigzag case but also applies
to all the DW systems with two diﬀerentiable valleys
along their edges. For the ﬁrst DW (DW1), helical
edge states emerge in the bulk gap with one (the other)
edge encoded spin up (down) around K (K(cid:48)) moving left
(right)(Fig. 3(b)), which is reminiscent of the edge states
of QSH eﬀects, but valley-polarized here. The emerging
of such novel helical DW edge states can be understood in
terms of the above topological charges formulae (Eq. 3).
The topological charges for the DW systems read

For the second DW (DW2) (Fig 3(d)), on its both
side are the inverse asymmetric heterostructures. There
are four valley-contrasted edge states in its bulk gap
(Fig 3(e)). Similar to the case of DW1, we can ex-

For stanene and silicene plus h-BN heterostructures,
we can perform the similar analysis as the case for ger-
manene. Their TB parameters are obtained by ﬁtting
with DFT band structures, given in Table I. It can be
found out that for the silicene heterostructures, the non-
trivial gap of pristine silicene is much smaller than stag-
gered potential in the asymmetric one and comparable
with the slight staggered potential in the symmetric one,
which implies that it could realize both the DW1 with
the help of an external electronic ﬁeld applied on the
side of the symmetric one and the DW2 with the high
Chern number edges states. As for the stanene case,
the staggered potential of h-BN subtrate cannot make
stanene own a trivial gap [63], hence both asymmetric
and symmetric sandwich heterostructures are ideal sys-
tems to preserve the intriguing topological properties of
stanene. Moreover, for the asymmetric heterostructures,
since the staggered potential of h-BN substrate is compa-
rable to the SOC of stanene, an external perpendicular
electric ﬁeld that can achieve in recent experiment condi-
tions can eﬀectively tune the band gap and the topologi-
cal properties. This might have potential applications in
the topological ﬁeld-eﬀect transistors [64].

In view of the success of epitaxial growth of single-
domain graphene on h-BN [65], it is promising to epi-
taxial grow germanene, stanene, and silicene on h-BN.
Moreover, given a silicene ﬁeld-eﬀect transistor has been
made experimentally by a smart fabrication process of
growing silicene on Ag(111) and then transferring it to
an insulating Al2O3/SiO2 substrate [33], we believe that
it is feasible to transfer the grown germanene, stanene,
and silicene onto h-BN substrate. Due to the slight lat-
tice mismatch here, the 2D superlattices of Moir´e pat-
tern may emerge and are particularly appealing, e.g., the
Hofstadter’s butterﬂy and the fractal quantum Hall ef-
fect [66, 67]. Consequently all the systems we mention
in this letter could be used as an excellent platform for
fundamental scientiﬁc study and promising device appli-
cation.

topological phase transitions can occur.

The patterns in such kinds of DWs conﬁgurations are
by virtue of engineering the h-BN substrates that could
have a sharp edge cut [59, 60], whereas the topological
edge states live in the host materials. Therefore, the
DWs have clean topological edge states with much less
dangling bonds than the nanoribbons of these hosts, and
thus these topological edge states could be more beneﬁ-
cial for the application in spintroincs and valleytronics.

DISCUSSIONS

The zero-energy edge states are exponentially local-
ized near the DW, across which the sign of the mass
term is inverted, i.e., [Mτz,sz (x < 0) + UEF (x < 0)] ×
[Mτz,sz (x > 0) + UEF (x > 0)] < 0. For the K ↑ channel
of DW1 with dispersion E = −vF ky, its wavefunction is
analytically given by the Jackiw-Rebbi solution [61],

h−BN + tL

SO, M (x > 0) = tR

(5)
where N is a normalization constant, M (x < 0) =

SO, and UEF here is zero.
For the other channels, the Jackiw-Rebbi solutions can
also be determined in a similar way. We calculate these
localized wavefunction distribution by using both analyt-
ical Jackiw-Rebbi solution (Eq. 5) and TB model (Eq. 1),
which agree with each other, as shown in Fig. 4(a). Fur-
thermore we propose a parallel DWs device concept based
on the intrinsic two kinds of DWs, which could be tailored
by diﬀerent superlattice patterns. Meanwhile, a perpen-
dicular external electric ﬁeld is a good knob to control
the intriguing DW edge states. In order to better utilize
these DW edge states, and it is desired that the states
located on diﬀerent DWs do not overlap appreciably. For
example, if we require the overlap to be as small as 1 %
of the state, then the distance of the DWs has a lower

diﬀerent lattice mismatch, they give a reference interval
of the staggered potentials which the h-BN substrates
can provide. Moreover the reference interval is larger
than the eﬀective spin-orbit coupling strength, half the
spin-orbit coupling gap, of Germanene (11.9 meV), hence
will give the same topological properties.

3 × 3 stanene on h-BN

√

31 × √

As for the calculation of stanene, we choose 3 × 3
31 h-BN with a rotation angle 9◦,
stanene on
with 18 Sn atoms and with approximately 0.25 % lat-
tice mismatch. The bandstructure of the asymmetric
heterostructures without and with SOC are shown in
Fig. A2. The eﬀective electric ﬁeld of h-BN opens a
trival gap about 70.4meV without SOC. When SOC
taken into account, the asymmetric heterostructure of
stanene is almost gapless with a small 3meV gap. From
the TB parameters mentioned in Table I, it is obvious
that tso > |Uh−BN|, so the gap is a topological gap ac-
cording to the TB model mentioned before.
