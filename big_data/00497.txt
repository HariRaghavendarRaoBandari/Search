ON THE HAUSDORFF DIMENSION OF CAT(κ) SURFACES

DAVID CONSTANTINE AND JEAN-FRANC¸ OIS LAFONT

Abstract. We prove a that a closed surface with a CAT(κ) metric has Haus-
dorﬀ dimension = 2, and that there are uniform upper and lower bounds on
the two-dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure of small metric balls. We also discuss
a connection between this uniformity condition and some results on the dy-
namics of the geodesic ﬂow for such surfaces. Finally, we give a short proof of
topological entropy rigidity for geodesic ﬂow on certain CAT(−1) manifolds.

1. Introduction

Let Σ be a closed surface, and let d be a locally CAT(κ) metric on Σ. One quan-
tity of natural interest is the Hausdorﬀ dimension of (Σ, d), denoted dimH (Σ, d).
This dimension is bounded below by 2, the topological (covering) dimension of Σ.
However, for an arbitrary metric on Σ there is no upper bound; this can be seen by
‘snowﬂaking’ the metric – replacing d(x, y) with d′(x, y) = d(x, y)α for 0 < α < 1,
which raises the the dimension by a factor of 1~α (see, e.g. [TW05]). In this paper
we examine the restriction placed on dimH (Σ, d) by the CAT(κ) condition, and
prove the following theorem:

Theorem 1. Let (Σ, d) be a CAT(κ) closed surface. Then dimH (Σ, d) = 2. More-
over, there exists some δ0 > 0 such that for all 0 < δ ≤ δ0,

H 2(B(p, δ)) > 0

and

inf
p∈Σ

sup
p∈Σ

H 2(B(p, δ)) < ∞

where H 2 denotes the 2-dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure and B(p, δ) is the ball of
radius δ around p.

We note that the second statement of the theorem implies the ﬁrst, but not
vice versa. Indeed there are metric spaces with Hausdorﬀ dimension d whose d-
dimensional Hausdorﬀ measures are zero or inﬁnite.

We became interested in this question for Hausdorﬀ measures, in particular the
uniform bounds on the measures of balls, while thinking about some results on
entropy for geodesic ﬂows on CAT(−1) manifolds. We include a discussion of these
results in the ﬁnal section of the paper, but here we state the two main theorems
we prove.

Theorem 2. Let (Σ, d) be a closed surface with a CAT(0) metric. Let φt be the
geodesic ﬂow on the space of geodesics for (Σ, d). Then the topological entropy for
the ﬂow equals the volume growth entropy for the Hausdorﬀ 2-measure.

Theorem 3. Let (X, d) be a closed CAT(−1) manifold (not necessarily Riemann-
ian), and suppose that X admits a Riemannian metric g so that (X, g) is a locally

geodesic ﬂows under the two metrics. Then

t ) be the topological entropies for the

htop(φd

t ) ≥ htop(φg

and if equality holds, (X, d) is also locally symmetric. If dim X > 2, (X, d) and
(X, g) are isometric.

Theorem 2 is a version of Manning’s [Man79] analogous result for Riemannian
manifolds of non-positive curvature, and relies on some work of Leuzinger [Leu06].
Theorem 3 follows from our Theorem 2 and a rigidity result of Bourdon ([Bou96]).
Our main work is to note how, via Theorem 2, Bourdon’s theorem can be recast
as a topological entropy rigidity theorem. This fact may well be known to experts,
but we have not found it addressed in the literature.

The paper is organized as follows.

In Sections 2 and 3 we show that small
distance spheres around each point in Σ are topological circles, and that they are
rectiﬁable with bounded length. In Section 4 we prove Theorem 1, and in Section
5 we discuss the extension of Main Theorem to higher dimensions, and give an
example which indicates some of the complications in doing so. In Section 6 we
give the proof of topological entropy rigidity (Theorem 3) for CAT(−1) manifolds.

2. The topology of small distance spheres

Let S(p, ǫ) = {z ∈ Σ ∶ d(p, z) = ǫ} and B(p, ǫ) = {z ∈ Σ ∶ d(p, z) ≤ ǫ} respectively
denote the metric ǫ-sphere and ǫ-ball centered at p. In this section we prove for
small ǫ, all S(p, ǫ) are topological circles. We note that the argument only works for
surfaces. In Section 5 we give examples of higher-dimensional CAT(−1) manifolds
where the analogous statement is not true.

Throughout this section, we work at small scale. We ﬁx ǫ0 > 0 small enough so

that the following two conditions are satisﬁed:

● ǫ0 ≤ Dκ~2 where Dκ is the diameter of the model space of constant curvature

κ, and

● For all p ∈ Σ, B(p, ǫ0) is (globally) CAT(κ).

At these scales, B(p, ǫ0) is locally uniquely geodesic – in particular there is a unique
geodesic from p to any point in B(p, ǫ0), which varies continuously with respect to
the endpoints. This will be a key fact in the work below. As a consequence, each
such ball B(p, ǫ0) is contractible, hence lifts isometrically to the universal cover
( ˜Σ, ˜d).

The following Lemma will be useful. Its proof, which is straightforward and can

be adapted to any dimension, can be found in [BH99, Proposition II.5.12].

Lemma 4. Let [xy] be a geodesic segment in Σ connecting an arbitrary pair of
points x and y. Then [xy] can be extended beyond y. That is, there is a geo-
desic segment (not necessarily unique) [xy′] properly containing [xy] as its initial
segment.

ON THE HAUSDORFF DIMENSION OF CAT(κ) SURFACES

Remark. Using the compactness of X, and a connectedness argument on R, this
lemma implies that each geodesic segment [xy] can be inﬁnitely extended.

The main result of this section is the following:

Proposition 5. Let Σ be a complete CAT(κ) surface. Then for all ǫ < ǫ0, S(p, ǫ)
is homeomorphic to the circle S1.

In order to establish this result, we use a well-known characterization of the
circle S1. The circle is the only compact, connected, metric space (X, d) with the
property that for any pair of distinct points a, b ∈ X, the complement X ∖ {a, b} is
disconnected (see, e.g [HY88, Theorem 2-28]). Let p ∈ Σ be an arbitrary point in
Σ, and to simplify notation, we set Sǫ ∶= S(p, ǫ). We now claim that for ǫ < ǫ0, Sǫ
is homeomorphic to a circle.

Lemma 6. For all ǫ < ǫ0, Sǫ is compact, path-connected, metric space.

Proof. Sǫ is a closed subset of the compact metric space Σ, so it is compact and
metric. Since ǫ < ǫ0, Sǫ lifts homeomorphically to a subset of ˜Σ. Since Σ is a
surface, ˜Σ is homeomorphic to R2 or S2, so we may take Sǫ to a be a compact
subset of R2 or S2.

Sǫ has diameter < Dκ, so we may ﬁnd a path S in R2 or S2 homeomorphic to
S1 bounding a disk containing Sǫ and remaining in B(p, ǫ0). Let proj ∶ S → Sǫ
be the nearest point projection (for the CAT(κ) metric lifted from Σ). This is a
continuous map. Since geodesics in ˜Σ are inﬁnitely extendible, for any point z on
Sǫ, the geodesic segment [pz] extends to a geodesic which hits S at a point q. Then
proj(q) = z and so this map is also surjective. The surjective, continuous map from
the path-connected set S to Sǫ proves that the latter is path-connected.
(cid:3)

Lemma 7. For all ǫ < ǫ0, and pairs of distinct points {a, b} ⊂ Sǫ, the space Sǫ∖{a, b}
is disconnected.

Proof. As in the proof of Lemma 6, let S in R2 or S2 be a Jordan curve containing Sǫ
and remaining in B(p, ǫ0). In particular, from the Schoenﬂies theorem, we can now
view Sǫ as contained inside a closed topological disk D2 (the curve S along with its
interior). Given the two distinct points a, b ∈ Sǫ, extend the two geodesic segments
[pa], [pb] to geodesic segments [pa′], [pb′], where a′, b′ are a pair of (distinct) points
on S, and [pa), [pb) are both contained in the interior of D2.

Note that [pa′], [pb′] might coincide on some subgeodesic originating from p.
Let w be the point at which these two geodesic segments separate, and consider
the concatenation [a′w] with [wb′]. By uniqueness of geodesics in B(p, ǫ0), we
have that [a′w] ∩ [wb′] = {w}, and hence they concatenate to give an embedded arc
joining the pair of points a′, b′ ∈ S = ∂D2. Moreover, the interior (a′b′) of the arc is
contained in the interior of D2. In follows that (a′b′) separates the interior of the
disk into two connected components U1, U2. (See Figure 1.)

Figure 1. Proving Sǫ is a circle.

Now by way of contradiction, let us assume Sǫ∖{a, b} is connected. Then without
loss of generality, Sǫ ∩ U1 must be empty. On the other hand, U1 is homeomorphic
to an open disk, whose boundary is a Jordan curve (formed by the arc (a′b′) in
the interior of D2, along with the portion of the boundary S joining a′ to b′). The
boundary of U1 contains the arc (wa′) passing through a, and the distance to p
varies continuously along (wa′) from a number < ǫ (since w ≠ a) to a number > ǫ
(since a ≠ a′). Pick an arc η inside U1 joining w to a′, and consider the distance
function restricted to η. It varies continuously from < ǫ to > ǫ, but since Sǫ ∩ U1 = ∅,
is never equal to ǫ. This is a contradiction, completing the proof.
(cid:3)

Using the topological characterization of S1, Proposition 5 now follows immedi-

ately from Lemma 6 and Lemma 7.

3. The geometry of small distance spheres

We now want to prove that for all p ∈ Σ and ǫ < ǫ0, Sǫ is rectiﬁable, and that the

lengths of these circles can be uniformly bounded above.

Lemma 8. Let Σ be a complete CAT(κ) surface. Then for any z ∈ Σ, and any
ǫ < ǫ0, S(z, ǫ) is a rectiﬁable curve.

Proof. Fix p. By Proposition 5, for ǫ < ǫ0, Sǫ is homeomorphic to a circle.

Note that if ǫ′ < ǫ, the rectiﬁability of Sǫ implies that Sǫ′ is also rectiﬁable. This
follows from the fact that the nearest-point projection πZ to a complete, convex
subset Z is distance non-increasing a ball of radius < ǫ0 in a CAT(κ) space (see,

ON THE HAUSDORFF DIMENSION OF CAT(κ) SURFACES

5

e.g. [BH99, Prop. II.2.4 (or the exercise following for κ > 0)]). Applying this to the
complete convex subset Z ∶= B(p, ǫ′), and using the (global) CAT(κ) geometry in
B(p, ǫ0), we see that πZ is just the radial projection towards p. In particular the
image of πZ lies on Sǫ′.

n

Note that for all n, at least one of l(arcE(n)), l(arcW (n)) must be inﬁnite, since
l(Sn) is inﬁnite. Without loss of generality, we may assume that l(arcE(n)) = ∞
for inﬁnitely many n, and hence (by the remark above) for all n. We focus our
attention now on the family {arcE(n)}n∈N.

On arcE(1) deﬁne the following equivalence relation: we declare x ∼ y if there
exists some n such that the arc in arcE(n) with endpoints [px] ∩ arcE(n) and
[py] ∩ arcE(n) is of ﬁnite length. That this is an equivalence relation is easy to
check. We denote equivalence classes by [x].

We note two things about arcE(1)~ ∼ and its equivalence classes. First, N(1) ≁
S(1), for otherwise arcE(n) would have ﬁnite length for some n. Second, for each
x ∈ arcE(1), [x] is an interval (possibly degenerate). This is because geodesics are
unique at the scale we work at, and if three points are arranged around arcE(1) in
order x < y < z, then [px] ∩ arcE(n) ≤ [py] ∩ arcE(n) ≤ [pz] ∩ arcE(n). Thus the
decomposition of arcE(1) into the equivalence classes of ∼ is a decomposition into
at least two disjoint subintervals (possibly degenerate) of the half-circle arcE(1).

6

DAVID CONSTANTINE AND JEAN-FRANC¸ OIS LAFONT

By connectedness of arcE(1), either [N(1)] or [S(1)] is a singleton, or some
equivalence class has a closed endpoint in the interior of arcE(1). Let z∗ be this
endpoint or the singleton N(1) or S(1).

If z∗ is an endpoint of arcE(1), let q be any other point in arcE(1). If z∗ is the
closed endpoint of [z∗] in the interior of arcE(1), let q be any point in arcE(1)
which lies on the z∗-side of [z∗]. We note that there are inﬁnitely many such q,
and by the choice of z∗ and the topology of the half-circle arcE(1), we may take a
sequence of such q approaching z∗. Observe that, since q and z∗ are not equivalent,
the geodesic segments [pz∗] and [pq] only agree at the point p.

Consider the geodesic segment [z∗q]. By the properties of geodesics in the
(globally) CAT(κ) set B(p, ǫ), this geodesic segment lies inside B(p, ǫ) and does
not cross the geodesic γ which divides the West and East parts of B(p, ǫ). Suppose
that [z∗q] does not intersect arcE(n) for some n (as in Figure 2). Then the radial
projection of [z∗q] onto Sn provides a path in arcE(n) from [pz∗] ∩ arcE(n) to
[pq] ∩ arcE(n). Again by the distance non-increasing properties of the projection,
since [z∗q] has ﬁnite length, this would imply z∗ ∼ q, which contradicts the choice
of q. Therefore the geodesic segment [z∗q] must intersect arcE(n) for all n. It must
therefore hit p, and by uniqueness of geodesics we conclude that [z∗q] = [z∗p]∪[pq].
Now consider B(z∗, ǫ). The work above shows that no q chosen as previously
described lies in B(p∗, ǫ). But this contradicts our observation above that, using
the half-circle topology of arcE(1), we may take such q approaching p∗. This
contradiction concludes the proof.
(cid:3)

Let us denote by l(γ) the length of a rectiﬁable curve γ. Using Lemma 8 and

the compactness of Σ we have:

Lemma 9. There exist δ0 > 0 and some uniform C > 0 such that for all z ∈ Σ,
l(S(z, δ0)) < C.
Proof. Suppose there is no uniform bound on l(S(z, δ0~2)). Then we may take a
sequence of points pn in Σ with l(S(pn, δ0~2)) ≥ n. Let p∗ be any subsequential limit
point of (pn) and note that B(p∗, δ0) properly contains S(pn, δ0~2) for suﬃciently
large n. The unbounded lengths of the latter, plus again the distance non-increasing
properties of nearest-point projection, would imply that the length of S(p∗, δ0) is
inﬁnite, contradicting Lemma 8. This proves the Lemma.
(cid:3)

4. Proof of Theorem 1

We deﬁne a particular non-expanding map from B(p, ǫ0) to the ball of radius ǫ0

in the model space H2. This will be a key tool in our proof of Theorem 1.

Deﬁne an equivalence relation on the set of geodesic segments starting at p by

declaring γ1 ∼ γ2 if the Alexandrov angle between these segments at p is 0.

Deﬁnition 10. (See, e.g. [BH99, Deﬁnition II.3.18]) The set of equivalence classes
for ∼, equipped with the metric provided by the Alexandrov angle, is the space of
directions at p, denoted Sp(Σ).

The following result is standard:

Proposition 11. (See, e.g. [BH99, Theorem II.3.19]) If ˜Σ is CAT(κ) for any κ,
then for each p ∈ ˜Σ, the completion of Sp( ˜Σ) is CAT(1).

ON THE HAUSDORFF DIMENSION OF CAT(κ) SURFACES

Lemma 12. For any p ∈ ˜Σ, where ˜Σ is a CAT(κ) surface, Sp( ˜Σ) ≅ S1.
Proof. The natural projection from Sǫ to Sp( ˜Σ) is continuous and, by Lemma 4,
surjective. The ﬁber over any point in Sp( ˜Σ) is easily seen to be a closed interval.
Thus Sp( ˜Σ) is homeomorphic to a quotient of S1, where each equivalence class
is a closed interval in S1. It is a well-known result that such a quotient space is
automatically homeomorphic to S1 (this can be easily shown using the topological
characterization of S1 used in the proof of Proposition 5). This establishes the
Lemma.
(cid:3)

Combining Proposition 11 with Lemma 12, which implies that Sp( ˜Σ) is complete,

we have
Corollary 13. For any p ∈ ˜Σ, Sp( ˜Σ) is CAT(1).

We now construct the non-expanding map to the model surface Mκ of con-
stant curvature κ. We closely follow the proof of a similar result presented in
[BBI01, Proposition 10.6.10], but for the opposite type of curvature bound (curva-
ture bounded below, rather than above).
Proposition 14. Let Σ be a CAT(κ) surface and p any point in Σ. Let ǫ0 be as
above. Then there is a map f ∶ B(p, ǫ0) → Mκ such that
(1) dMκ(f(x), f(y)) ≤ dΣ(x, y) for all x, y ∈ B(p, ǫ0),
(2) dMκ(f(p), f(y)) = dΣ(p, y) for all y ∈ B(p, ǫ0), and
(3) f(B(p, ǫ)) = BMκ(f(p), ǫ).

Proof. By the choice of ǫ0, we can work in Σ or lift B(p, ǫ0) homeomorphically to
˜Σ. By corollary 13, Sp(Σ) is CAT(1). It is homeomorphic to S1, so it is easy to
see that there is a surjective map g ∶ Sp(Σ) → S1 which is non-expanding:

dS1(g(v), g(w)) ≤ ∡p(v, w)

for all

v, w ∈ Sp( ˜Σ).

Let K κ

p ( ˜Σ) denote the κ-cone over Sp( ˜Σ) (see, e.g.

deﬁnition, and the fact that Sp(Σ) is CAT(1), K κ

DAVID CONSTANTINE AND JEAN-FRANC¸ OIS LAFONT

Proof of Theorem 1. Let δ0 = ǫ0 and let δ < δ0. First we bound H 2(B(p, δ)) below.
Let f be the non-expanding map provided by Proposition 14. Since f preserves
radial distance from the origin, f(B(p, δ)) ⊆ B(f(p), δ). Fix any ρ > 0 and sup-
pose {Ui} is a countable cover of B(p, δ) with diam(Ui) < ρ. Then the collection
{f(Ui)} covers B(f(p), δ) and diam(f(Ui)) ≤ diam(Ui) < ρ as f is non-expanding.
Therefore,

Σi diam Ui

2 ≥ Σi diam f(Ui)2 ≥ H 2

ρ(B(f(p), δ)).

The right-hand quantity approaches H 2(B(f(p), δ)) as ρ → 0. But this is just the
volume of a δ ball in Mκ, the model space of curvature κ. Since this is indepen-
dent of the choice of basepoint p, we obtain the desired uniform lower bound on
H 2(B(p, δ)).

Now we bound H 2(B(p, δ)) above. This portion of the proof uses the bound
on the length of Sδ obtained in Lemma 9. It is suﬃcient to bound H 2(B(p, δ0))
uniformly above.

Fix ρ < δ0. Let Eρ be any ﬁnite ρ

2 -spanning subset of Sδ0 . The circumference
bound allows us to uniformly bound #Eρ. Index xj ∈ Eρ in order around Sδ0 . Let
Tj be the geodesic triangle with vertices p, xj , xj+1. Tj has edges of length δ0, δ0
and < ρ. Let τj be the corresponding comparison triangle in Mκ (see Figure 3).

In Mκ, let rj be the δ0-length edge from ¯p to ¯xj. Let r(ρ) be the number of

set in rj . Let their centers be ¯y1, . . . ¯yr(ρ). Note that we can take r(ρ) = C′ δ0
ρ for
C′ a constant independent of ρ. Now, pick ¯zi on the other δ0-length side of τj and
in B(¯yi, ρ) ∩ B(¯yi+1, ρ). Draw in τj and in Tj the zig-zagging segments connecting
yi to zi to yi+1 to zi+1 etc. These partition τj and Tj into a union of triangles. In
Tj each has all three sides of length < ρ, by the choice of ¯yi and ¯zi. By CAT(κ),

the corresponding triangles in Tj also have all sides of length < ρ, and then, again
by CAT(κ), we see that the ρ-balls centered at yi in Tj cover Tj.

Since lg(Sδ0) < C, we can take #Eρ ≤ 2C

ρ . Then B(p, δ0) can be covered by
ρ2 balls of radius ρ. Thus we obtain a ﬁnite cover {Ui} of B(p, δ0) with

which is bounded above independently of ρ. It follows that H 2(B(p, δ0)) ≤ 8CC′δ0,
which veriﬁes that H 2(B(p, δ0)) is ﬁnite and bounded above uniformly in p.

5. Local geometry of CAT(−1) spaces in higher dimensions

In this section we make a few remarks on the obstructions to extending the local
geometry results we proved for surfaces to higher dimensions. We note that the
proofs in the previous section rely heavily on the 2-dimensionality of Σ. We do
not know if an analogue of Theorem 1 holds for CAT(κ) metrics on closed higher
dimensional manifolds. One of the ﬁrst steps in our proof was Proposition 5, which
showed that the small enough metric spheres inside locally CAT(κ) surfaces were
homeomorphic to the circle S1. The analogous statement fails in dimensions ≥ 5,
as the well-known example below shows.

Proposition 15. For each dimension n ≥ 5, there exists a closed n-manifold M
equipped with a piecewise hyperbolic, locally CAT(−1) metric, and a point p ∈ M
with the property that for all small enough ǫ, the ǫ-sphere Sǫ centered at p is not
homeomorphic to Sn−1. In fact, Sǫ is not even a manifold.

Proof. Such examples can be found in the work of Davis and Januszkiewicz [DJ91,
Theorem 5b.1]. We brieﬂy summarize the construction for the convenience of the
reader. Start with a closed smooth homology sphere N n−2 which is not homeo-
morphic to Sn−2. Such manifolds exist for all n ≥ 5, and are quotients of Sn−2
by a suitable perfect group π1(N n−2). Take a smooth triangulation of N n−2, and
consider the induced triangulation T on the double suspension Σ2(N n−2). By work
of Cannon and Edwards, Σ2(N n−2) is homeomorphic to Sn. The triangulation T
on Sn is not a PL-triangulation, as there exists a 4-cycle in the 1-skeleton of the
triangulation whose link is homeomorphic to N n−2. Now apply the strict hyper-
bolization procedure of Charney and Davis [CD95] to the triangulated manifold
(Sn, T ).

This outputs a piecewise-hyperbolic, locally CAT(-1) space M . A key point of
the hyperbolization procedure is that it preserves the local structure. Since the
input (Sn, T ) is a closed n-manifold, the output M is also a closed n-manifold.
The 4-cycle in T whose link was homeomorphic to N n−2 now produces a closed
geodesic γ in M , whose link is still homeomorphic to N n−2 (i.e. the “unit normal”
to γ forms a copy of N n−2). It follows from this that, picking the point p on γ, all
small ǫ-spheres Sǫ are homeomorphic to the suspension ΣN n−2. Since N n−2 was
not the standard sphere, Sǫ ≅ ΣN n−2 fails to be a manifold at the suspension point
x, as every small punctured neighborhood of x will have non-trivial π1. We refer
the reader to [DJ91, Section 5] for more details.

This cautionary example suggests that small metric spheres in high-dimensional
locally CAT(κ) manifolds could exhibit pathologies. In view of these results, and
the interest in obtaining higher dimensional analogs, we raise the following question.

Question . Let M be a closed n-manifold equipped with a locally CAT(−1) metric
of Hausdorﬀ dimension d. Can d ever be strictly larger than n? Do the uniform
bound conditions of Theorem 1 hold in higher dimensions?

The authors suspect that examples with d > n do indeed exist in higher dimen-

sions.

6. Entropy rigidity in CAT(-1)

In this section we present an entropy rigidity result for closed CAT(−1) mani-
folds. This result generalizes Hamenst¨adt’s entropy rigidity result from [Ham90] to
the CAT (−1) setting. It is very closely related to, and in fact relies on, a rigid-
ity result of Bourdon. The main addition to Bourdon’s theorem is the connection
to topological entropy via a theorem of Leuzinger (generalizing work of Manning).
The theorem draws heavily on the work of others, but we have not seen it presented
in this form in the literature.

We remark that our work on Hausdorﬀ 2-measure for surfaces, presented in the
earlier sections of this paper, was inspired in part by condition (⋆) that features in
Leuzinger’s theorem below (Theorem 21).

Recall that a negatively curved locally symmetric space has universal cover iso-
metric to Hm
K, where m ≥ 2 and K is R, C, the quaternions H, or the octonions
O (with m = 2). We suppose that the metrics on these spaces are scaled so that
the maximum sectional curvature is −1. The topological entropy for the geodesic
ﬂow on a compact locally symmetric space modeled on Hm
K is km + k − 2 where
k = dimR K. (For the deﬁnition of topological entropy, see [KH95, §3.1].)

More generally, if one has a locally CAT(−1) metric d on the manifold M , there is
an associated space G(M, d) of geodesics in M : this is the space of locally isometric
maps R → M . Via lifting to the universal cover, this space is topologically a quotient
of Sn−1 × Sn−1 × R by a suitable Γ ∶= π1(M) action. There is a natural ﬂow φd
t on
G(M, d), given by precomposition with an R-translation. This is called the geodesic
ﬂow associated to the metric d. One can again measure the topological entropy of
this ﬂow.

The main result of this section is the following restatement of our Theorem 3:

Theorem 16. Let (X, d) be a closed n-dimensional manifold equipped with a locally
CAT(−1) metric d (not necessarily Riemannian). Suppose that X also supports a
locally symmetric Riemannian metric g, under which (X, g) is locally modeled on
Hm

K, normalized to have maximum sectional curvature −1. Then

htop(φd

t ) ≥ htop(φg

t ) = km + k − 2

and if equality holds in the above, (X, d) is also locally symmetric. If n > 2, (X, d)
and (X, g) are isometric.

This should be compared with the main theorem of [Ham90], which establishes
this same result when the metric d is a Riemannian metric with sectional curvature
≤ −1. The key element in this proof is the following theorem of Bourdon, which he
notes is a generalization of Hamenst¨adt’s work.

ON THE HAUSDORFF DIMENSION OF CAT(κ) SURFACES

Theorem 17. [Bou95, Th´eor`eme 0.3 and following remarks] Let ˜X be a CAT(−1)
space with a cocompact isometric action by Γ which also acts convex cocompactly
by isometries on a negatively curved symmetric space S = Hm
K. Let Λ be the limit
set in ∂∞ ˜X of Γ, and let d∗ and g∗ denote the visual metrics on ∂∞ ˜X and ∂∞S,
respectively. Suppose that dimH(Λ, d∗) = dimH(∂∞S, g∗). Then there exists an
isometric embedding F from S into ˜X such that ∂∞F (∂∞S) = Λ. If dimR S > 2,
then this embedding is Γ-equivariant.

This theorem proves rigidity for the extremal value of dimH(Λ, d∗) – an extremal

value which had already been computed by Pansu:

Theorem 18. [Pan89, Th´eor`eme 5.5] With notation as in Theorem 17,

dimH(Λ, d∗) ≥ dimH(∂∞S, g∗) = km + k − 2.

A deﬁnition for the visual metrics referenced above can be found in [BH99,
§III.H.3]. Here we give a short deﬁnition of a distance function which is Lipschitz
equivalent to any visual metric. Since Hausdorﬀ dimension can be calculated us-
ing any distance function in the Lipschitz equivalence class, this suﬃces for our
purposes.
Deﬁnition 19. Let ( ˜X, ˜d) be a CAT(−1) metric space and let ζ, η ∈ ∂∞ ˜X. Fix
some basepoint x ∈ ˜X and deﬁne
x(ζ, η) = e− ˜d(x,[ζη]),
d∗

where [ζη] denotes the bi-inﬁnite geodesic in ˜X with endpoints at ζ and η. It is
straightforward to see that the Lipschitz class of d∗

x is independent of x.

We also need the following result of Manning, as generalized to the CAT(−1)

setting by Leuzinger.

Deﬁnition 20. Let (X, d) be a closed manifold with some metric d and endowed
with a measure vol. Let ( ˜X, ˜d) denote its universal cover. Then the volume growth
entropy of ( ˜X, ˜d) with respect to vol is

hvol( ˜X, ˜d) ∶= lim sup
R→∞

1
R

vol(B(p, R))

where B(p, R) is the ball of radius R about a point p in ˜X.

Manning shows that this is independent of the choice of p and that, for Rie-

mannian manifolds, the lim sup is in fact a limit.
Theorem 21 (Leuzinger, [Leu06]; compare with Manning [Man79]). Let ( ˜X, ˜d) be
a geodesically complete, locally geodesic metric space endowed with a measure vol,
and having compact quotient ˜X~Γ. Assume that

(⋆) there exists some 0 < δ0 < ∞ such that for all 0 < δ ≤ δ0,
vol(B(z, δ)) < ∞.

0 < inf
z∈X

vol(B(z, δ)) and sup
z∈X

Then

htop(φt) ≥ hvol( ˜X, ˜d).

If, in addition, ( ˜X, ˜d) is CAT(0), then

htop(φt) = hvol( ˜X, ˜d).

12

DAVID CONSTANTINE AND JEAN-FRANC¸ OIS LAFONT

Manning proved this result for Riemannian manifolds (for which condition (⋆)
holds automatically); Leuzinger extracts the key conditions from that proof, namely
(⋆) and convexity of the function d(c1(t), c2(t)), the distance between a pair of
geodesics. The latter is automatically satisﬁed in a CAT(0) space.

In the surface case, the validity of condition (⋆) for 2-dimensional Hausdorﬀ
measure is established in our Theorem 1, so applying Theorem 21 immediately
yields Theorem 2.

Finally, we note the following.

Proposition 22. Let (X, d) be compact and locally CAT(−1), and suppose that
vol is a measure on X giving ﬁnite, nonzero measure to X. Then

hvol( ˜X, ˜d) = dimH(∂∞ ˜X, d∗
x)

where dimH denotes Hausdorﬀ dimension.

Proof of Prop 22. Let N(R) = #{γ ∈ Γ ∶ d ˜X(∗, γ∗) ≤ R}. The result follows easily
from the following facts. First, due to Bourdon [Bou95, Theorem 2.7.5], we have
that

dimH(∂∞ ˜X, d∗

x) = lim sup
R→∞

1
R

log N(R).

Second, if we let F be a bounded fundamental domain for the Γ-action, with volume
V and diameter D,

and

vol(B(∗, R)) ≤ V ⋅ N(R + D)

V ⋅ N(R) ≤ vol(B(∗, R + D)).

(cid:3)

We now prove Theorem 16.

Proof of Theorem 16. Since X is a manifold, we may ﬁx some Riemannian metric
on X, for example the locally symmetric metric g (though any metric will do).
This deﬁnes a Riemannian volume form vol on X. We ﬁrst claim that vol satisﬁes
condition (⋆) from Theorem 21.

Indeed, take δ0 so small that any δ0-ball for the d-metric on X lifts isometri-
cally to ( ˜X, ˜d). Then the volume of such a ball is clearly bounded above by the
Riemannian volume of X, which is ﬁnite as X is compact. This establishes the
uniform upper bound on vol(Bd(z, δ)).

Suppose that there is no uniform positive lower bound. Then for any ﬁxed
δ > 0, there exists a sequence of points zn in X such that vol(Bd(zn, δ)) → 0.
By compactness we may extract a convergent subsequence zni with limit z∗. For
suﬃciently large i, Bd(z∗, δ~2) ⊂ Bd(zni , δ) and hence vol(Bd(z∗, δ~2)) = 0. Since
d and the Riemannian metric g induce the same topology on X, there exists some
ǫ > 0 such that Bg(z∗, ǫ) ⊂ Bd(z∗, δ~2). But the Riemannian volume of Bg(z∗, ǫ)
must be strictly positive, giving a contradiction. Therefore, condition (⋆) holds for
vol.

Let (S, g) be the negatively curved symmetric space on which (X, g) is locally
modelled. Using Theorem 21, Proposition 22 and Theorem 18 and the fact that Γ

13

acts cocompactly on X (and so Λ = ∂∞ ˜X), we have

htop(φd

t ) = hvol( ˜X, ˜d)

= dimH(∂∞ ˜X, d∗
x)
≥ dimH(∂∞S, g∗
x)
= kn′

+ k − 2.

Now suppose that htop(φd

t ) achieves the lower bound. Then by Theorem 17,
there exists an isometric embedding F from S into X with ∂∞F (∂∞S) = Λ = ∂∞ ˜X;
if n > 2, this embedding can be taken to be Γ-equivariant. Since X is a manifold
with dim(X) = dim(S) and ∂∞F (∂∞S) is the full boundary at inﬁnity of ˜X, it
follows that this isometric embedding is in fact surjective. This ﬁnishes the proof.
