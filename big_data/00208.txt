Abstract

Let σ be a non-atomic, inﬁnite Radon measure on Rd, for example, dσ(x) = z dx where
z > 0. We consider a system of freely independent particles x1, . . . , xN in a bounded set
Λ ⊂ Rd, where each particle xi has distribution 1
σ(Λ) σ on Λ and the number of particles, N ,
is random and has Poisson distribution with parameter σ(Λ). If the particles were classically
independent rather than freely independent, this particle system would be the restriction
to Λ of the Poisson point process on Rd with intensity measure σ.
In the case of free
independence, this particle system is not the restriction of the free Poisson process on Rd
with intensity measure σ. Nevertheless, we prove that this is true in an approximative sense:
n=1 Λ(n) = Rd,
then the corresponding particle system in Λ(n) converges (as n → ∞) to the free Poisson
process on Rd with intensity measure σ. We also prove the following N/V -limit: Let N (n) be
a determinstic sequence of natural numbers such that limn→∞ N (n)/σ(Λ(n)) = 1. Then the
system of N (n) freely independent particles in Λ(n) converges (as n → ∞) to the free Poisson
process. We ﬁnally extend these results to the case of a free L´evy white noise (in particular,
a free L´evy process) without free Gaussian part.

Keywords: Completely random measure; freely independent particle systems; free

Introduction

1
Let Γ(Rd) denote the conﬁguration space of an (inﬁnite) system of identical particles
in Rd. By deﬁnition, Γ(Rd) is the collection of all sets γ ⊂ Rd which are locally ﬁnite.
A probability measure on Γ(Rd) is called a point process, see e.g. [12]. In statistical
mechanics, a point process describes the state of a system of particles in the continuum.
Although every realistic system has only a ﬁnite number of particles, many important
physical phenomena can only be described by inﬁnite particle systems, see e.g. [8, 20].
An inﬁnite system of particles without interaction is described by a Poisson point
process. Let σ be a non-atomic, inﬁnite Radon measure on Rd, for example dσ(x) =
z dx, where z > 0. A Poisson point process on Rd with intensity measure σ is the
probability measure π on Γ(Rd) whose Fourier transform is given by the formula (5)
below. The measure π can also be uniquely characterized by the following property:
For Λ ∈ B0(Rd), the number of particles of a conﬁguration γ which belong to Λ has
Poisson distribution with parameter σ(Λ), and given that γ ∩ Λ = {x1, . . . , xN} the
particles x1, . . . , xN are independent and the distribution of each particle xi on Λ is 1
V σ.
Here, B0(Rd) denotes the collection of all bounded Borel subsets of Rd, and V = σ(Λ)
is the volume of Λ.
The Poisson point process π can be derived through the N/V -limit. More precisely,
let us consider an isotone sequence of sets Λ(n) ∈ B0(Rd), i.e., Λ(1) ⊂ Λ(2) ⊂ Λ(3) ⊂ ··· ,
n=1 Λ(n) = Rd. Denote V (n) := σ(Λ(n)) and let N (n) be natural
numbers such that the condition (6) below is satisﬁed. Then the Poisson point process
π is equal to the limit (as n → ∞) of the system of N (n) independent particles in Λ(n)
such that the distribution of each particle on Λ(n) is

discrete signed Radon measures on Rd, i.e., signed Radon measures of the form(cid:80)

This result admits a generalization to measure-valued L´evy processes on Rd, which
are probability measures on K(Rd), e.g. [13–15]. Here K(Rd) denotes the space of all
i siδxi,
where si (cid:54)= 0 and δxi denotes the Dirac measure with mass at xi. The points xi may be
interpreted as locations of particles (or some organisms in biological interpretation).
The weights si are a certain attribute attached to these particles (organisms). Note
that the set {xi} is not necessarily locally ﬁnite. For a large class of measure-valued
L´evy processes, {xi} is even dense in Rd a.s. [15].

In free probability, the notion of independence of random variables is replaced
by Voiculescu’s deﬁnition of free independence of noncommutative probability spaces.
This has led to a deep theory, in which many results are noncommutative analogs of
fundamental results of classical probability theory, see e.g. [18,26,27]. Let us speciﬁcally
mention the paper [3], which studies stable laws and domains of attraction in free
probability theory and establishes the Bercovici–Pata bijection between the inﬁnitely
divisible distributions on R and the freely inﬁnitely divisible distributions on R. See
also [1, 5, 26] for discussions of free L´evy processes.

An analog of the classical Poisson distribution on R with parameter α is the free

2

Poisson distribution with parameter α, also known as the Marchenko–Pastur distri-
bution. This distribution can be derived as the limit (as n → ∞) of the nth free
convolution power of the distribution (1 − α
n δ1, where α > 0 is a parameter
of the distribution. It should be stressed that the free Poisson distribution is not dis-
crete: it has density with respect to the Lebesgue measure and possibly one atom, see
e.g. [18].

n )δ0 + α

As shown in [1,26], the Poisson point process with intensity σ also has a counterpart
in free probability. According to [6], the free Poisson process on Rd is a real algebra
generated by a family of bounded selfadjoint operators A(f ) in the full Fock space over
L2(Rd, σ), and the vacuum state on this algebra plays the role of an expectation. Here
f belongs to the class of bounded measurable functions on Rd with compact support.
The operators A(f ) resemble the commuting operators in the symmetric Fock space
over L2(Rd, σ) which identify the Poisson point process, see e.g. [16, 23].

In the case of the one-dimensional underlying space R, Ben Arous and Kargin [2]
gave a rigorous meaning to the heuristic notion of a system of N freely independent,
identically distributed particles. Furthermore, it follows from [2, Theorem 2] that the
N/V -limit holds for a free Poisson process on R. More precisely, if the condition (6) be-
low is satisﬁed, the free Poisson process with intensity measure σ can be approximated
by a system of N (n) freely independent particles in Λ(n) such that the distribution of
each particle on Λ(n) is

1
V (n) σ.

The ﬁrst result of the present paper states that the N/V -limit holds for a free
Poisson process on any underlying space Rd (and even on any locally compact Polish
space). We prove the convergence of the corresponding moments, which is stronger than
the weak convergence shown in [2] in the case of the underlying space R. Furthermore,
our proof of this result is signiﬁcantly shorter and simpler than the proof in [2]. We
also extend the N/V -limit to the case of a free L´evy white noise as deﬁned in [6]. In
particular, such a result holds for a free L´evy process without free Gaussian part [1].
The main result of the paper concerns a noncommutative probability space (A (Λ), τΛ)
which describes a system of N freely independent particles in a set Λ ∈ B0(Rd) which
have distribution σ
V , where the number of particles, N , is random and has the (classical)
Poisson distribution with parameter σ(Λ). Here A (Λ) is an algebra of (unbounded)
linear operators in a certain Hilbert space and τΛ is a trace on this algebra. As men-
tioned above, if the particles were independent rather than freely independent, then
this particle system would be precisely the restriction to Λ of the Poisson point process
on Rd with intensity measure σ. However, in our noncommutative setting, (A (Λ), τΛ)
is not the restriction to Λ of the free Poisson process with intensity σ. Nevertheless,
we prove that, if (Λ(n))∞
n=1 is an isotone sequence of sets from B0(Rd) whose union is
Rd, then the probability spaces (A (Λ(n)), τΛ(n)) converge, in the sense of moments, to
the free Poisson process on Rd with intensity σ.
The latter result can be interpreted as follows. Let Θ, Λ ∈ B0(Rd) be such that Θ ⊂
Λ and the set Λ is much larger than Θ. Then the restriction to Θ of the noncommutative

3

probability space (A (Λ), τΛ) is very close to the restriction to Θ of the free Poisson
process on Rd with intensity σ. We also extend this result to the case of a free L´evy
white noise (in particular, a free L´evy process).

We stress that, for the results of this paper, it is principal that both the underlying

space and the intensity measure of the free Poisson process are inﬁnite.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we brieﬂy recall some deﬁnitions
and properties related to the classical Poisson point process, a measure-valued L´evy
process, and a L´evy white noise. Although we do not use these results directly in
this paper, they are needed to better understand analogy and diﬀerences between the
classical and the free cases. In Section 3 we recall the deﬁnition of free independence,
namely in terms of cumulants which is more convenient for applications. Moreover we
deﬁne the free L´evy white noise. In Section 4, we construct noncommutative probability
spaces which describe systems of freely independent, identically distributed particles,
i=1 siδxi such that the
pairs (si, xi) are independent and identically distributed. In Section 5, we formulate
the results of the paper. Finally, in Section 6 we prove the results.

2 A measure-valued L´evy process and a L´evy white

noise

γ =(cid:80)

Let X be a locally compact Polish space. Let B(X) denote the Borel σ-algebra on X,
and let B0(X) denote the collection of all Borel sets in X which have compact closure.
A measure on (X, B(X)) is called Radon if it takes ﬁnite values on each set from
B0(X). A signed Radon measure on X is a diﬀerence of two Radon measures on X.
Let M(X) denote the collection of all signed Radon measures on X. The space M(X)
is equipped with the vague topology, and let B(M(X)) denote the corresponding Borel
σ-algebra.
The conﬁguration space Γ(X) is deﬁned as the collection of all sets γ ⊂ X that
are locally ﬁnite. Usually, a conﬁguration γ ∈ Γ(X) is identiﬁed with the measure
x∈γ δx, where δx denotes the Dirac measure with mass at x. Under this identiﬁ-
cation, the conﬁguration γ becomes a Radon measure on X, so we have the inclusion
Γ(X) ⊂ M(X). Below it should always be clear from the context which of the two
interpretations of a conﬁguration we are currently using.

A measurable mapping η from a probability space into M(X) is called a (signed)
random measure on X, see e.g. [12, 14]. If η takes a.s. values in Γ(X), then η is called
a (simple) point process. (In particular, any probability measure on M(X) or Γ(X)
identiﬁes a random measure or a point process, respectively.)
A random measure η is called completely random if, for any mutually disjoint sets
Λ1, . . . , Λn ∈ B0(X), the random variables η(Λ1), . . . , η(Λn) are independent [13, 14].

4

Let us ﬁx a reference measure σ on X. We assume that σ is a non-atomic Radon

measure and σ(X) = ∞.
Assume that a completely random measure η has in addition the property that, for
any two sets Λ1, Λ2 ∈ B0(X) such that σ(Λ1) = σ(Λ2), the random variables η(Λ1)
and η(Λ2) have the same distribution. Then, in e.g. [15, 24], such a random measure
was called a measure-valued L´evy process on X. If X = R, σ is the Lebesgue measure,
and Lt := η([0, t]), then (Lt)t≥0 is just a classical L´evy process of bounded variation.
The following proposition describes the measure-valued L´evy process on X in terms of
their Fourier transform.

Proposition 1 ( [13, 14]). (i) Let η be a random measure on X, and let µ denote the
distribution of η. Then η is a measure-valued L´evy process on X if and only if there
exists a measure ν on R∗ := R \ {0} which satisﬁes

min{1,|s|} dν(s) < ∞,

(1)

(cid:90)

and the Fourier transform of µ is given by

f ∈ B0(X).

and (cid:104)f, η(cid:105) :=(cid:82)

X f dη.

Here B0(X) is the set of all bounded measurable functions on X with compact support,

(ii) Let µ denote the distribution of a measure-valued L´evy process on X. Let K(X)

denote the set of all signed discrete Radon measures on X, i.e.,

(cid:40)

(cid:88)

K(X) :=

η =

siδxi ∈ M(X)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) si (cid:54)= 0, xi ∈ X

(cid:41)

.

Then µ(K(X)) = 1.

i

If the measure µ has Fourier transform (2), then ν is called the L´evy measure of µ.

Remark 2. Assume in addition that X is a smooth Riemannian manifold. Let ν be a
measure on R∗ which does not satisfy (1) but satisﬁes the following weaker assumption:

(cid:90)

R∗

(cid:20)(cid:90)

(cid:90)

min{1, s2} dν(s) < ∞.

(3)

Then, instead of a measure-valued L´evy process η, one may consider the associated
centered generalized stochastic process with independent values, ˜µ, see [10]. In e.g. [7],
˜µ is also called the centered L´evy white noise measure. Let us explain this in more
detail. Let

D(X) ⊂ L2(X, σ) ⊂ D(cid:48)(X)

5

be the standard triple of spaces in which D(X) is the nuclear space of smooth, com-
pactly supported functions on X and D(cid:48)(X) is the dual space of D(X) with respect
to zero space L2(X, σ), see e.g. [4, Chap. 11, Sect. 1]. Evidently, M(X) ⊂ D(cid:48)(X).
For simplicity of notations, let us also assume that the following stronger assumption
holds:

(cid:90)

s2 dν(s) < ∞,

(4)
Then there exists a (centered) probability measure ˜µ on D(cid:48)(X) which has Fourier

Here for ω ∈ D(cid:48)(X) and f ∈ D(X), we denote by (cid:104)f, ω(cid:105) the dual pairing between ω
and f .

By choosing in Proposition 1 the measure ν to be δ1, we get the Poisson point
process on X with intensity measure σ, whose distribution we denote by π. We have
π(Γ(X))=1 and π has Fourier transform

Remark 3. Let us equip R∗ = R\{0} with a metric such that a set Λ ⊂ R∗ is compact
in R∗ if and only if Λ is compact in R. In particular, for any compact set Λ in R∗
the distance (in R) from Λ to zero is strictly positive. We construct the following
measurable injective (but not surjective) mapping

i

see [11, Theorem 6.2]. As easily seen, the pushforward of the measure µ from Proposi-
tion 1 under R is the Poisson point process on X × R∗ with intensity measure σ ⊗ ν.
Now we will formulate two results of the classical probability theory whose analogs

we want to derive in the free setting.
Proposition 4. Let Λ ∈ B0(X) with σ(Λ) > 0. Let (xi)∞
i=1 be a sequence of in-
dependent random points in Λ with distribution σΛ := 1
σ(Λ) σ. Let N be a random
variable which has Poisson distribution with parameter σ(Λ), and let N be independent
of (xi)∞
i=1 δxi. Then πΛ is
the restriction to the set Λ of the Poisson point process π, i.e., the pushforward of π
under the measurable mapping

i=1. We deﬁne πΛ as the distribution of the point process(cid:80)N

Γ(X) (cid:51) γ (cid:55)→ γ ∩ Λ ∈ Γ(Λ),

which coincides with the Poisson point process on Λ with intensity σ.

6

Remark 5. Quite often, Proposition 4 is used as the deﬁnition of the Poisson point
process π, i.e., one deﬁnes π as the unique probability measure on Γ(X) such that, for
each Λ ∈ B0(X), the restriction of π to Λ is equal to the measure πΛ from Proposition 4.
Proposition 6 (N/V -limit). Let Λ(n) ∈ B0(X), n ∈ N, be such that Λ(1) ⊂ Λ(2) ⊂
n=1 Λ(n) = X, i.e., Λ(n) (cid:37) X. Denote V (n) := σ(Λ(n)), V (n) → ∞ as
n → ∞. Let N (n) ∈ N, n ∈ N, be such that

Λ(3) ⊂ ··· and(cid:83)∞

(6)
(Note that the numbers N (n) are not random.) For each n ∈ N, we deﬁne ρ(n) as the
distribution of the point process

ρ(n) → π weakly as n → ∞.

For a proof of Proposition 6, see e.g. [19].

Remark 7. In view of Remark 3, the result of Proposition 6 can be extended to a
measure µ from Proposition 1. More precisely, let Λ(n) ∈ B0(X), Λ(n) (cid:37) X, let
∆(n) ∈ B0(R∗), ∆(n) (cid:37) R∗, let V (n) := σ(Λ(n))ν(∆(n)), and let N (n) ∈ N satisfy (6).
For each n ∈ N, we deﬁne ρ(n) as the distribution of the random measure

Furthermore, it can be shown that, if X is a smooth Riemannian manifold and
condition (3) is satisﬁed, then ˜ρ(n) → ˜µ weakly as n → ∞. Here ˜ρ(n) is the centered
random measure ρ(n), i.e., the distribution of the random measure

According to the classical deﬁnition of cumulants, for any f1, . . . , fn ∈ B0(X), the
cumulant C (n)((cid:104)f1,·(cid:105), . . . ,(cid:104)fn,·(cid:105)) is deﬁned recurrently by the following formula, which
connects the cumulants with the moments:
(cid:104)f1, η(cid:105)(cid:104)f2, η(cid:105)···(cid:104)fn, η(cid:105) dµ(η) =

A direct calculation shows that the cumulants of µ are given by

measure ˜µ given in Remark 2 is equal to zero, while the cumulants C (n) for n ≥ 2 are
still given by formula (10).

3 Free independence and free L´evy white noise

Let us recall the deﬁnition of free independence and free L´evy white noise.

Let A be a von Neumann algebra of bounded linear operators acting in a separable
Hilbert space, and let τ be a faithful normal trace which satisﬁes the condition τ (1) =
1. The pair (A , τ ) is called a W ∗-probability space. An element a ∈ A is called a
noncommutative random variable.
Let A1, . . . , An be subalgebras of A . The algebras A1, . . . , An are called freely
independent if, for any numbers i1, i2, . . . , im ∈ {1, . . . , n} (m ≥ 2) such that il (cid:54)= il+1
for l = 1, . . . , m − 1, and for all al ∈ Ail with τ (al) = 0, l = 1, . . . , m, we have

τ (a1a2 ··· am) = 0.

8

Selfadjoint elements a1, . . . , an ∈ A are called freely independent if the algebras

A1, . . . , An that they respectively generate are freely independent.

The above deﬁnition of free independence is not very convenient for applications.
Speicher [21] (see also [22]) gave an equivalent deﬁnition based on the idea of free
cumulants.
A set partition θ = {B1, . . . , Bk} of {1, . . . , n} is called non-crossing if there do not
exist Bi, Bj ∈ θ, i (cid:54)= j, for which the following inequalities hold: x1 < y1 < x2 < y2
for some x1, x2 ∈ Bi and y1, y2 ∈ Bj. We denote by N P(n) the collection of all
non-crossing set partitions of {1, . . . , n}.
For a1, . . . , an ∈ A , the free cumulant R(n)(a1, . . . , an) is deﬁned recurrently by the

following formula:

τ (a1a2 ··· an) =

(cid:88)

(cid:89)

θ∈N P(n)

B∈θ

R(B; a1, . . . , an),

(12)

where for each B = {i1, . . . , ik} ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , n} with i1 < i2 < ··· < ik,

R(B; a1, . . . , an) := R(k)(ai1, . . . , aik).

(13)
Theorem 9 ( [21]). The selfadjoint elements a1, . . . , an ∈ A are freely independent if
and only if, for each k ≥ 2 and any indices i1, . . . , ik ∈ {1, . . . , n} such that there exist
il (cid:54)= im, we have

R(k)(ai1, . . . , aik) = 0.

Analogously to [6], we will now deﬁne a free L´evy white noise. Let us ﬁrst recall
several deﬁnitions related to the Fock space. Let H be a real separable Hilbert space.
We denote by F (H) the (full) Fock space over H:

∞(cid:77)

n=0

F (H) :=

H⊗n.

where H⊗0 := R. The vector Ω = (1, 0, 0, . . . ) is called the vacuum.

For h ∈ H, we deﬁne a creation operator a+(h) as a bounded linear operator in

F (H) satisfying

a+(h)f (n) = h ⊗ f (n),

f (n) ∈ H⊗n.

The adjoint of a+(h) is an annihilation operator, which satisﬁes

a−(h)f1 ⊗ ··· ⊗ fn = (h, f1)H f2 ⊗ ··· ⊗ fn,

f1, . . . , fn ∈ H.

For a bounded linear operator L in H, we deﬁne a bounded linear operator a0(L) in
F (H) by

a0(L)Ω := 0,

a0(L)f1 ⊗ ··· ⊗ fn = (Lf1) ⊗ f2 ⊗ ··· ⊗ fn,

f1, . . . , fn ∈ H.

Remark 10. In fact, instead of requiring (14) and (15), we could have supposed that
ν satisﬁes (9). However, the operators appearing bellow would be, generally speaking,
unbounded and we would have to specify their domain. Still the results of the paper
which hold under the assumptions (14) and (15) would remain true under the weaker
assumption (9).

Let f ∈ B0(X). We deﬁne f ⊗ id : X × R∗ → R, f ⊗ id(x, s) := f (x)s. By (14) and

(15),

f ⊗ id ∈ L2(X × R∗, σ ⊗ ν) ∩ L1(X × R∗, σ ⊗ ν) ∩ L∞(X × R∗, σ ⊗ ν).

So, we deﬁne a selfadjoint bounded linear operator

A(f ) := a+(f ⊗ id) + a0(f ⊗ id) + a−(f ⊗ id) +

(cid:90)

X

(cid:90)

R∗

f dσ

s dν(s)

(16)

in F (L2(X × R∗, σ ⊗ ν)). When deﬁning the operator a0(f ⊗ id) we identiﬁed the
function f ⊗ id with the operator of multiplication by this function acting in L2(X ×
R∗, σ ⊗ ν).

Let A denote the real algebra generated by the operators (A(f ))f∈B0(X). We deﬁne

a trace τ on A by

(17)
A straightforward calculation shows that, for any f1, . . . , fn ∈ B0(X), the nth free
cumulant is given by

τ (a) = (aΩ, Ω)F (L2(X×R∗,σ⊗ν)),

a ∈ A .

R(n)(cid:0)A(f1), . . . , A(fn)(cid:1) =

(cid:90)

X

sn dν(s)

R∗

f1(x)f2(x)··· fn(x) dσ(x), n ∈ N,

(18)

compare with (10). Hence, by Theorem 9, for any f1, . . . , fn ∈ B0(X) such that
fifj = 0 σ-a.e. if i (cid:54)= j, the noncommutative random variables A(f1), . . . , A(fn) are
freely independent. In particular, for any mutually disjoint sets Λ1, . . . , Λn ∈ B0(X),
the noncommutative random variables A(Λ1), . . . , A(Λn) are freely independent. Here,
for Λ ∈ B0(X), we denote A(Λ) := A(χΛ), where χΛ is the indicator function of Λ.

Furthermore, for any Λ1, Λ2 ∈ B0(X) with σ(Λ1) = σ(Λ2), we have

τ (A(Λ1)n) = τ (A(Λ2)n)

for all n ∈ N.

10

Hence the selfadjoint operators A(Λ1) and A(Λ2) have the same spectral measure at
the vacuum state Ω. Thus, we can think of the family of operators (A(f ))f∈B0(X) as a
free L´evy white noise with L´evy measure ν.

In the case where ν = δ1, the operators A(f ) act in the Fock space F (L2(X, σ))

and have the form

A(f ) := a+(f ) + a0(f ) + a−(f ) +

(cid:90)

Their free cumulants are given by

X

f1(x)f2(x)··· fn(x) dσ(x), n ∈ N,

(20)

compare with (11). The operators (A(f ))f∈B0(X) are called a free Poisson process on
X with intensity measure σ.

In the case where condition (14) is satisﬁed, but instead of (15) the weaker condition

(4) holds, we still have

f ⊗ id ∈ L2(X × R∗, σ ⊗ ν) ∩ L∞(X × R∗, σ ⊗ ν).

So, we deﬁne selfadjoint operators

˜A(f ) := a+(f ⊗ id) + a0(f ⊗ id) + a−(f ⊗ id)

(21)
in F (L2(X × R∗, σ ⊗ ν)). We similarly deﬁne ( ˜A , τ ) and we get R(1)( ˜A(f )) = 0 and

R(n)(cid:0) ˜A(f1), . . . , ˜A(fn)(cid:1) =

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

X

sn dν(s)

R∗

f1(x)f2(x)··· fn(x) dσ(x), n ≥ 2.

Hence ( ˜A(f ))f∈B0(X) is a centered free L´evy white noise with L´evy measure ν, compare
with Remarks 2 and 8.
Remark 11. Let X = R and let dσ(x) = dx be the Lebesgue measure on R. Let ν be
a measure on R∗ which satisﬁes (4), (14). For each t ≥ 0, we deﬁne L(t) := ˜A(χ[0,t]).
Then (L(t))t≥0 is a centered free L´evy process without free Gaussian part, see [1].

4 Freely independent particles

In this section we will construct systems of freely independent particles in a ﬁnite
volume.

11

PΛ. We consider a point process γ =(cid:80)N

4.1 N freely independent particles
Assume Λ ∈ B0(X). Let PΛ be a probability measure on Λ and let N ∈ N, N ≥ 2.
Assume that x1, . . . , xN are independent random points in Λ which have distribution
i=1 δxi. We wish to introduce a counterpart of
such a point process in which the particles x1, . . . , xN are freely independent. This is
done by generalizing the approach of Ben Arous and Kargin [2] in the case X = R.
If we ﬁx a function f ∈ B0(X) and integrate f with respect to γ, we get the random

variable

f (xi),

(22)

N(cid:88)

i=1

which is a sum of N independent identically distributed random variables f (xi). Since
each xi has distribution PΛ, we may think of each random variable f (xi) as the operator
of multiplication by the function f acting in the Hilbert space L2(Λ, PΛ). We denote
this operator by M (Λ; f ). Thus, we may think of the classical random variable (22) as
the bounded linear operator

N(cid:88)

Mi(Λ; f )

acting in the tensor product L2(Λ, PΛ)⊗N , where the ith operator Mi(Λ; f ) is the
M (Λ; f ) operator acting in the ith space of the tensor product L2(Λ, PΛ)⊗N .

i=1

To construct the free version, let us consider the algebra generated by the (commu-
tative) operators (M (Λ; f ))f∈B0(X) in L2(Λ, PΛ). We deﬁne a trace τΛ on this algebra
by setting, for any f1, . . . , fk ∈ B0(X),

(cid:0)M (Λ; f1)··· M (Λ; fk)(cid:1) := (M (Λ; f1)··· M (Λ; fk)1, 1)L2(Λ,PΛ) =

f1 ··· fk dPΛ.
(23)
The next step is to construct the free product of N copies of this (commutative)
W ∗-probability space, see e.g. [17,18]. For the reader’s convenience, let us brieﬂy recall
this construction.

(cid:90)

τΛ

Λ

We deﬁne a Hilbert space

where (cid:104)f(cid:105) :=(cid:82)

H :=(cid:8)f ∈ L2(Λ, P ) | (cid:104)f(cid:105) = 0(cid:9) ,

Λ f dPΛ and the Hilbert space H is equipped with the scalar product of
L2(Λ, PΛ). Let H1, . . . , HN denote N copies of the space H. We deﬁne a Hilbert space

H (Λ, N ) := R ⊕ (cid:77)

Hl1 ⊗ Hl2 ⊗ ··· ⊗ Hlk.

k∈N

l1,...,lk∈{1,...,N}
lj(cid:54)=lj+1, j=1,...,k−1

12

We set ΨN := (1, 0, 0, . . . ) ∈ H (Λ, N ). For any i ∈ {1, . . . , N} and f ∈ B0(X), we
deﬁne a bounded linear operator Mi(Λ; f ) in H (Λ, N ) by setting

Mi(Λ; f )ΨN := (cid:104)f(cid:105)ΨN + [f ]i,

where [f ]i := f − (cid:104)f(cid:105) ∈ Hi, and for any k ∈ N and any gj ∈ Hlj , j = 1, . . . , k with
lj (cid:54)= lj+1, we set: if i (cid:54)= l1,

Mi(Λ; f )g1 ⊗ g2 ⊗ ··· ⊗ gk := (cid:104)f(cid:105) g1 ⊗ g2 ⊗ ··· ⊗ gk + [f ]i ⊗ g1 ⊗ g2 ⊗ ··· ⊗ gk

and if i = l1,

Mi(Λ; f )g1 ⊗ g2 ⊗ ··· ⊗ gk := (cid:104)f g1(cid:105) g2 ⊗ ··· ⊗ gk + [f g1]i ⊗ g2 ⊗ ··· ⊗ gk.

We denote by M (Λ, N ) the algebra generated by all the operators Mi(Λ; f ) in
H (Λ, N ), and by Mi(Λ, N ) the subalgebra of M (Λ, N ) that is generated by the op-
erators Mi(Λ; f ) with a ﬁxed i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N}. We deﬁne a trace τΛ,N on M (Λ, N )
by

τΛ,N (a) := (aΨN , ΨN )H (Λ,N ),

(24)
Then the subalgebras Mi(Λ, N ) with i = 1, . . . , N are freely independent in the W ∗-
probability space (M (Λ, N ), τΛ,N ). Furthermore, for each ﬁxed i, we have

a ∈ M (Λ, N ).

(cid:0)M (Λ; f1)··· M (Λ; fk)(cid:1).

τΛ,N

(cid:0)Mi(Λ; f1)··· Mi(Λ; fk)(cid:1) = τΛ
N(cid:88)

A(Λ, N ; f ) :=

For each f ∈ B0(X), we now set

(25)

(26)

Mi(Λ; f ).

The operators(cid:0)A(Λ, N ; f )(cid:1)
the subalgebra of M (Λ, N ) that is generated by the operators (cid:0)A(Λ, N ; f )(cid:1)

f∈B0(X) may be thought of as a system of N freely indepen-
dent particles in Λ such that each particle has distribution PΛ. We denote by A (Λ, N )
f∈B0(X).

Thus, we have constructed the W ∗-probability space (A (Λ, N ), τΛ,N ).

i=1

4.2 Poisson-distributed random number of freely independent

particles

Next, let us consider the case where the number of particles, N , is random and has
Poisson distribution with parameter α > 0. To realize this situation, we proceed as
follows. For a Hilbert space H and a constant c > 0, we denote by H c the Hilbert
space which coincides with H as a set but the scalar product in H c is equal to the
scalar product in H times c.

13

We also denote H (Λ, 0) := R, Ψ0 := 1 ∈ H (Λ, 0), and A(Λ, 0; f ) := 0 for all
f ∈ B0(X). This corresponds to the case when there are no particles in Λ. In particular,
Ψ0 may be thought of as the indicator function of an empty set.

We deﬁne a Hilbert space

H (Λ) :=

∞(cid:77)

N =0

H (Λ, N )

e−α.

αN
N !

We denote by Hﬁn(Λ) the dense subset of H (Λ) which consists of all ﬁnite sequences
(F0, F1, . . . , Fk, 0, 0, . . . ) with Fi ∈ H (Λ, i), i = 1, . . . , k, k ∈ N.
For each f ∈ B0(X), we deﬁne a (Hermitian) linear operator A(Λ; f ) in H (Λ) with

domain Hﬁn(Λ) by

∞(cid:88)

N =0

A(Λ; f ) =

A(Λ, N ; f ),

where each operator A(Λ, N ; f ) acts in H (Λ, N ). Evidently, each operator A(Λ; f )
maps Hﬁn(Λ) into itself.

We denote by A (Λ) the algebra generated by the operators (A(Λ; f ))f∈B0(X). A

trace τΛ on A (Λ) is given by

∞(cid:88)

N =0

τΛ(a) :=

(aΨN , ΨN )H (Λ,N )

e−α,

a ∈ A (Λ).

αN
N !

(27)

As easily seen, the series in formula (27) indeed converges for each a ∈ A (Λ).
Remark 12. As the operators A(Λ; f ) are unbounded, strictly speaking (A (Λ), τΛ) is
not a W ∗-probability space. We will call it a noncommutative probability space.

4.3 Discrete measures with freely independent atoms

and weights

points xi and weights si: η = (cid:80)N

Let ∆ ∈ B0(R∗) and let PΛ×∆ be a probability measure on Λ× ∆. Let N ∈ N, N ≥ 2.
Assume that (x1, s1), . . . , (xN , sN ) are independent random points in Λ× ∆ which have
distribution PΛ×∆. We consider a random discrete measure which has atoms at the
i=1 siδxi. Analogously to subsec. 4.1, we may now
easily introduce a free analog of this random measure. Indeed, integrating a function
f ∈ B0(X) with respect to η, we get a random variable

sif (xi),

(28)

which is a sum of N independent identically distributed random variables sif (xi).

i=1

14

N(cid:88)

So, starting with the Hilbert space L2(Λ×∆, PΛ×∆) instead of L2(Λ, PΛ), we deﬁne a
Hilbert space H (Λ×∆, N ) analogously to H (Λ, N ). Using the function f ⊗id instead
of f , we deﬁne bounded linear operators Mi(Λ × ∆; f ) in H (Λ × ∆, N ). Analogously
to subsec. 4.1, we deﬁne an algebra M (Λ× ∆, N ), a trace τΛ×∆ on it, and subalgebras
Mi(Λ×∆, N ), which are freely independent. Finally, we deﬁne operators A(Λ×∆, N ; f )
and the corresponding subalgebra A (Λ × ∆, N ). (We have used obvious notations.)

The W ∗-probability space (cid:0)A (Λ × ∆, N ), τΛ×∆,N

(cid:1) is the required free analog of the

random measure (28).

Let us also note that, analogously to subsec. 4.2, we may also construct a noncom-
mutative probability space corresponding to the case where the number of particles,
N , in A (Λ × ∆, N ) is random and has Poisson distribution with parameter α. We de-
note the corresponding operators by A(Λ× ∆; f ), and the noncommutative probability
space by (A (Λ × ∆), τΛ×∆).

5 Approximations

In this section, we will formulate the main results of the paper, the proofs will be given
in Section 6 below.

Our ﬁrst result is the free counterpart of Proposition 6.

Theorem 13 (N/V limit for the free Poisson process). Let Λ(n) ∈ B0(X), n ∈ N, and
Λ(n) (cid:37) X. Denote V (n) := σ(Λ(n)), V (n) → ∞ as n → ∞. Let N (n) ∈ N, n ∈ N, be
such that (6) holds. For each n ∈ N, consider the W ∗-probability space

(cid:0)A (Λ(n), N (n)), τΛ(n),N (n)

(cid:1),

(29)

(31)

lim
n→∞ τΛ(n),N (n)

constructed in subsec. 4.1, which describes N (n) freely independent particles in Λ(n) with
V (n) σ. Then, as n → ∞, the W ∗-probability space (29) converges
distribution σ(n) = 1
to the W ∗-probability space (A , τ ) of the free Poisson process on X with intensity σ.
The convergence is in the sense of moments, i.e., for any f1, . . . , fk ∈ B0(X),

(cid:0)A(Λ(n), N (n); f1)··· A(Λ(n), N (n); fk)(cid:1) = τ (A(f1)··· A(fk)).

(30)
Here, for each f ∈ B0(X), A(f ) is the operator in F (L2(X, σ)) deﬁned by (19), and
τ is given by formula (17) with ν = δ1.
Remark 14. In the case X = R, Theorem 2 in [2] implies that the W ∗-probability space
(29) converges weakly to the W ∗-probability space (A , τ ), i.e., for each f ∈ B0(X) and
k ∈ N,

(cid:0)A(Λ(n), N (n); f )k(cid:1) = τ (A(f )k).

lim
n→∞ τΛ(n),N (n)

However, in the noncommutative setting, formula (31) does not imply the stronger
statement (30).

15

The following statement is a free analog of Remark 7.

Corollary 15 (N/V limit for the free L´evy white noise). Assume that a measure ν
on R∗ satisﬁes (14) and (15). Let Λ(n) ∈ B0(X), Λ(n) (cid:37) X, let ∆(n) ∈ B0(R∗),
∆(n) (cid:37) R∗, let V (n) := σ(Λ(n))ν(∆(n)), and let N (n) ∈ N satisfy (6). For each n ∈ N,
consider the W ∗-probability space

(cid:0)A (Λ(n) × ∆(n), N (n)), τΛ(n)×∆(n),N (n)

(cid:1),

(32)

lim
n→∞ τΛ(n)×∆(n),N (n)
= τ (A(f1)··· A(fk)).

1

constructed in subsec. 4.3, which describes the sum of N (n) freely independent random
measures siδxi, where each (si, xi) is a random point in Λ(n) × ∆(n) with distribution
V (n) σ ⊗ ν. Then, as n → ∞, the W ∗-probability space (32) converges to the W ∗-
probability space (A , τ ) which describes the free L´evy white noise with L´evy measure
ν. The convergence is in the sense of moments, i.e., for any f1, . . . , fk ∈ B0(X),

(cid:0)A(Λ(n) × ∆(n), N (n); f1)··· A(Λ(n) × ∆(n), N (n); fk)(cid:1)

(33)
Here, for each f ∈ B0(X), A(f ) is the operator in F (L2(X × R∗, σ ⊗ ν)) deﬁned by
(16), and τ is given by (17).

If instead of (15), the measure ν satisﬁes the weaker assumption (4), we still have
the following approximation of the centered free L´evy white noise with L´evy measure ν:
for any f1, . . . , fk ∈ B0(X),

(cid:0) ˜A(Λ(n) × ∆(n), N (n); f1)··· ˜A(Λ(n) × ∆(n), N (n); fk)(cid:1)

lim
n→∞ τΛ(n)×∆(n),N (n)
= τ ( ˜A(f1)··· ˜A(fk)).

(34)

Here

˜A(Λ × ∆, N ; f ) := A(Λ × ∆, N ; f ) − τΛ×∆,N (A(Λ × ∆, N ; f ))

and ˜A(f ) is deﬁned by (21).

According to Proposition 4, in the classical case the measure πΛ is precisely the
restriction to Λ of the Poisson point process π. As will be seen from the proof of
Theorem 16 below, a direct analog of this fact is not true in the free case, i.e., the free
counterpart of πΛ is not the restriction to Λ of the free Poisson process.
Theorem 16 (approximation of the free Poisson process). Let Λ(n) ∈ B0(X), n ∈ N,
and Λ(n) (cid:37) X, σ(Λ(n)) → ∞ as n → ∞. For each n ∈ N, consider the noncom-
mutative probability space (A (Λ(n)), τΛ(n)), constructed in subsec. 4.2, which describes
N (n) freely independent particles in Λ(n) with distribution σ(n), where N (n) is a random
number which has Poisson distribution with parameter σ(Λ(n)). Then, as n → ∞,
the noncommutative probability space (A (Λ(n)), τΛ(n)) converges to the W ∗-probability

16

space (A , τ ) of the free Poisson process on X with intensity σ. The convergence is in
the sense of moments, i.e., for any f1, . . . , fk ∈ B0(X),

(cid:0)A(Λ(n); f1)··· A(Λ(n); fk)(cid:1) = τ (A(f1)··· A(fk)).

(35)

lim
n→∞ τΛ(n)

Here, the operators A(fi) and the state τ are as in Theorem 13.

The corresponding result also holds for a free L´evy white noise.

Corollary 17 (approximation of the free L´evy white noise). Assume that a measure ν
on R∗ satisﬁes (14) and (15). Let Λ(n) ∈ B0(X), Λ(n) (cid:37) X, let ∆(n) ∈ B0(R∗), ∆(n) (cid:37)
R∗, and let V (n) := σ(Λ(n))ν(∆(n)). For each n ∈ N, consider the noncommutative
probability space

(A (Λ(n) × ∆(n)), τΛ(n)×∆(n)),

(36)

1

constructed in subsec. 4.3, which describes a sum of N (n) freely independent random
measures siδxi, where each (si, xi) is a random point in Λ(n) × ∆(n) with distribution
V (n) σ⊗ ν, and N (n) is a random number which has Poisson distribution with parameter
V (n). Then, as n → ∞, the noncommutative probability space (36) converges (in the
sense of moments) to the W ∗-probability space (A , τ ) which describes the free L´evy
white noise with L´evy measure ν.

If instead of (15), the measure ν satisﬁes the weaker assumption (4), we still have
the following approximation of the centered free L´evy white noise with L´evy measure ν:
for any f1, . . . , fk ∈ B0(X),

(cid:0) ˜A(Λ(n) × ∆(n); f1)··· ˜A(Λ(n) × ∆(n); fk)(cid:1) = τ ( ˜A(f1)··· ˜A(fk)).

(37)

lim
n→∞ τΛ(n)×∆(n)

Here ˜A(f ) is deﬁned by (21), and

˜A(Λ(n) × ∆(n); f ) =

∞(cid:88)

N =0

˜A(Λ(n) × ∆(n), N ; f ),

where the operator

˜A(Λ(n) × ∆(n), N ; f ) := A(Λ(n) × ∆(n), N ; f ) − τΛ(n)×∆(n),N

(cid:0)A(Λ(n) × ∆(n), N ; f )(cid:1)

acts in H (Λ(n) × ∆(n), N ).

Remark 18. The results of this section may be seen as the free analogs of equivalence
of ensembles for the ideal gas, cf. [9].

6 Proofs

The results presented in the lemma below are well known and can be easily derived
from the deﬁnition of a free cumulant.

Lemma 19. Let A be an algebra and let τ be a trace on A . Let the free cumulants
on A be deﬁned through (12). The following statements hold.

(i) For each n ∈ N, there exist cθ ∈ Z with θ ∈ N P(n) such that

R(n)(a1, . . . , an) =

cθ τ (B, a1, . . . , an),

a1, . . . , an ∈ A .

θ∈N P(n)

B∈θ

Here, for each B = {i1, . . . , ik} ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , n} with i1 < i2 < ··· < ik,

τ (B; a1, . . . , an) := τ (ai1 ··· aik).

Furthermore, for the partition θ which has only one element, {1, 2, . . . , n}, we have
cθ = 1.
(ii) For any a ∈ A , denote ˜a := a − τ (a). Then R(1)(˜a) = 0, any for any
a1, . . . , an ∈ A with n ≥ 2,

R(n)(˜a1, . . . , ˜an) = R(n)(a1, . . . , an).

(39)

Proof of Theorem 13. By (12) and (38), formula (30) is equivalent to the following
statement: for any f1, . . . , fk ∈ B0(X), k ∈ N,

(cid:0)A(Λ(n), N (n); f1), . . . , A(Λ(n), N (n); fk)(cid:1) = R(k)(A(f1), . . . , A(fk)) (40)

the number of non-crossing partitions θ ∈ N P(k) such that |θ| = l and π ≤ θ. Note
that the number of all partitions θ of {1, . . . , k} such that |θ| = l and π ≤ θ is equal

(57)

Here I(θ; f1, . . . , fk) is deﬁned analogously to (48), (49) with Λ(n) being replaced with
X.

Proof. We prove formula (55) by induction on m. We have already shown that (55)
holds for m = 2, see (54). So assume that (55) holds for m ∈ {2, . . . , k − 1}, and we
have to prove (55) for m + 1. The key observation here is that

K(N, m + 1, m) = (N − 1)m,

(58)

which is equivalent to the following classical identity for the Stirling numbers of the
second kind:

m(cid:88)

N m =

S(m, j)(N )j,

see e.g. [25, Theorem 13.5]. The rest of the proof is similar to the way we derived
formula (54) from (47).

Indeed, for each θ ∈ N P(k) with |θ| = m + 1, we have

(cid:0)θ; M (Λ(n); f1), . . . , M (Λ(n); fk)(cid:1) =

Note that, in (61),

0 ≤ S(i, m + 1) − NS(θ, m + 1) ≤ S(k, m + 1).

Hence, analogously to (53), there exists a constant Cm+1 > 0 such that, for each
i ∈ {m + 2, . . . , k} and n ∈ N,

Hence, by (60), the induction step is proven.

which implies (35).

Proof of Corollary 17. The ﬁrst statement trivially follows from the proof of Theo-
rem 16. To prove formula (37), we proceed as follows. Using Lemma 19, we get,
analogously to (45),
