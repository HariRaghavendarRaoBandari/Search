ABSTRACT

We present the results of our broadband study of the γ-ray emitting narrow line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxy
SBS 0846+513 (z = 0.585). This includes multi-band ﬂux variations, γ-ray spectral analysis, broad band
spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling, and intranight optical variability (INOV) observations carried
over 6 nights between 2012 November and 2013 March using the 2 m Himalayan Chandra Telescope and the
1.3 m telescope at Devasthal. Multiple episodes of ﬂaring activity are seen in the γ-ray light curve of the source
which are also reﬂected in the observations at lower frequencies. A statistically signiﬁcant curvature is noticed
in the seven years averaged γ-ray spectrum, thus indicating its similarity with powerful ﬂat spectrum radio
quasars (FSRQs). Modeling the SEDs with a one zone leptonic emission model hints the optical-UV spectrum
to be dominated by synchrotron radiation, whereas, inverse Compton scattering of broad line region photons
reproduces the γ-ray part of the SEDs. The source was found to be variable on all the six nights of optical
observations with a variation of ∼0.3 magnitude within a single night, coinciding with a high γ-ray activity
state. The observed large amplitude INOV clearly indicates the presence of a closely aligned beamed relativistic
jet in SBS 0846+513. Our broadband study supports the recent claims in literature that γ-ray emitting NLSy1
galaxies are similar to blazars and constitute the low black hole mass counterparts to FSRQs.

1. INTRODUCTION

The high energy extragalactic γ-ray sky, as seen by
is dominated by
the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope,
(AGN, e.g.,
the blazar class of active galactic nuclei
Ackermann et al. 2015). Along with blazars, signiﬁcant
γ-ray emission is also observed from about half-a-dozen
radio-loud narrow line Seyfert 1 (RL-NLSy1) galaxies (e.g.,
Abdo et al. 2009; Foschini 2011; D’Ammando et al. 2012;
Yao et al. 2015). NLSy1 galaxies are a sub-class of AGN
with peculiar properties that distinguishes them from the
conventional broad line Seyfert 1 galaxies. For example,
their optical spectra consist of narrow Balmer lines (FWHM
(Hβ) < 2000 km s−1), weak [O III] ([O III]/Hβ < 3),
and strong optical Fe II lines (Osterbrock & Pogge 1985;
Goodrich 1989). They exhibit rapid X-ray ﬂux variations
(Pounds et al. 1995) and steep soft X-ray spectra (Boller et al.
1996).
It is found that NLSy1 galaxies, in general, host
low-mass black holes (∼ 106 − 108M⊙) accreting close to
the Eddington limit (Grupe & Mathur 2004; Xu et al. 2012).
About 7% of the NLSy1 galaxy population are found to
be radio-loud and many of them exhibit compact core-jet
radio morphology, ﬂat/inverted radio spectra, high bright-
ness temperature, and superluminal patterns (Komossa et al.
2006; Doi et al. 2006). These features hint for the presence
of closely aligned relativistic jets in them and observations
from the Fermi-Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) provided
the conﬁrmation. Therefore, it is of great interest to test
their similarities/dissimilarities with the blazar class of AGN,
which emits copiously in the γ-ray band. The optical and
infrared (IR) ﬂux variations of some of these γ-ray emit-
ting NLSy1 (γ-NLSy1) galaxies are found to be similar to

vaidehi@iiap.res.in

blazars (Liu et al. 2010; Jiang et al. 2012; Paliya et al. 2013a).
Variable optical polarization, similar to that known in sev-
eral blazars is also observed in some γ-ray emitting NLSy1
galaxies (Itoh et al. 2013, 2014). Blazars are known to show
hr-scale γ-ray ﬂux variations (e.g., Foschini et al. 2011) and
a similar short timescale γ-ray variability was noticed from
a NLSy1 galaxy 1H 0323+342 (z = 0.063) during its 2013
September outburst (Paliya et al. 2014). A statistically sig-
niﬁcant curvature is observed in the γ-ray spectra of few γ-
NLSy1 galaxies (Paliya et al. 2015) which indicates their re-
semblance more with the FSRQ class of blazars. The broad-
band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of γ-NLSy1 galax-
ies exhibit the typical double hump structure (e.g., Abdo et al.
2009; D’Ammando et al. 2012; Paliya et al. 2013b), similar
to blazars. Additionally, the requirement of external Comp-
ton (EC) mechanism to explain the γ-ray window of the
SED provides another supporting evidence of the resem-
blance of these objects with FSRQs (e.g., Abdo et al. 2009;
D’Ammando et al. 2012; Foschini et al. 2012; Paliya et al.
2013b).
SBS

J2000;
Decl.=+51:08:28, J2000; z = 0.585) is a NLSy1 galaxy
found to be a γ-ray emitter by Foschini (2011). Fermi-LAT
has observed more than one episodes of γ-ray ﬂaring activity
from this object where the isotropic γ-ray luminosity reaches
as high as 1048 erg s−1 (e.g., D’Ammando et al. 2012).
Maune et al. (2014) have reported a high amplitude three-
magnitude optical ﬂare in 2013 April, closely associated with
a high γ-ray state. They also reported the detection of high
optical polarization (∼10%) during the same period. The
very high brightness temperature (Tb >1013 K; Zhou et al.
2005), large amplitude optical variability, and the detection
of superluminal motion (D’Ammando et al. 2012) further

hint for the presence of closely aligned relativistic jet in
this source.
In this work, using all the publicly available
multi-wavelength data taken during the ﬁrst seven years
of Fermi operation, we study this source in detail. New
observations of its intra-night optical variability (INOV)
characteristics are also presented. Considering a leptonic
origin of radiation, we present a consistent picture of the
physical properties of this source.

The paper is organized as follows. We describe the adopted
data reduction procedure in section 2. The obtained results
are presented and discussed in section 3 followed by the con-
clusion in section 4. We use the cosmological parameters
Ωm=0.27 and Hubble constant H0 = 71 km s−1 Mpc−1.

2. MULTI-WAVELENGTH OBSERVATIONS AND DATA

REDUCTIONS

2.1. Fermi-Large Area Telescope Observations

We analyze LAT observations of SBS 0846+513 cover-
ing the ﬁrst seven years of Fermi monitoring, i.e., MJD
54683−57222. We follow the standard data reduction pro-
cedure as described in the online documentation1 and here
it is brieﬂy mentioned. We use the latest data set (Pass 8)
and, in the energy range of 0.1−300 GeV, events belong-
ing to evclass 128 and evtype 3 and lying within 15◦
source region are considered. Data analysis is performed with
the package ScienceTools v10r0p5 along with the use
of instrument response functions P8R2 SOURCE V6. To
avoid the contamination from Earth limb γ-rays, the maxi-
mum zenith angle is adopted as 90◦. The region of interest
(ROI) is deﬁned as a circle of 10◦ radius centered at the γ-
ray position of SBS 0846+513, as deﬁned in the third catalog
of Fermi-LAT detected objects (3FGL; Acero et al. 2015). A
maximum likelihood test statistics (TS) = 2∆log(L), where
L represents the likelihood function between models with
and without a point source at the source position, is derived
to determine the signiﬁcance of the γ-ray signal. All the
sources present within ROI and deﬁned in the 3FGL catalog
are considered for the spectral analysis with their parameters
left free to vary during the ﬁtting.
In addition to that, ob-
jects lying between 10◦ to 15◦ from the source of interest,
are also included, however, their parameters are kept ﬁxed to
the 3FGL catalog values. Galactic and the isotropic extra-
galactic background emissions are also properly accounted
using the latest background templates (gll iem v06.fit
and iso P8R2 SOURCE V6 v06.txt, respectively). A binned
likelihood analysis is performed over the period of interest
and all the sources with TS<25 are removed. This updated
model is then used for further temporal and spectral studies.
All the errors associated with the LAT data analysis are 1σ
statistical uncertainties, unless speciﬁed. Primarily governed
by the uncertainty in the effective area, the systematic un-
certainties on the measured ﬂuxes are energy dependent: it
amounts to 10% at 30 MeV, decreasing linearly as a function
of log(E) to 3% at 100 MeV, and increases linearly as a func-
tion of log(E) beyond 100 GeV to about 15% at 1 TeV2.

2.2. Swift Telescope Observations

The Swift telescope (Gehrels et al. 2004) has observed SBS
0846+513 for a total of 14 times in the ﬁrst seven years of
Fermi mission (covering MJD 54683−57222 or 2008 August

1 http: //fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/documentation/
2 http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/LAT caveats.html

4 to 2015 July 15). The source was observed using all the
three instruments on board: the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT;
Barthelmy et al. 2005, 15−150 keV), the X-Ray Telescope
(XRT; Burrows et al. 2005, 0.3−10 keV), and the Ultravio-
let/Optical Telescope (UVOT; Roming et al. 2005, 170−600
nm).

SBS 0846+513 is never detected by BAT, primarily due to
poor sensitivity of the instrument for short exposures and also
due to the low level of hard X-ray emission from the source.
Consequently, it is not included in the 70-month Swift-BAT
hard X-ray catalog (Baumgartner et al. 2013).

In particular,

We reduce the XRT data following standard proce-
dures available within the HEASOFT package (6.17) and
using the latest CALDB ﬁles.
the tool
xrtpipeline(v.0.13.1) is used to perform standard
screening and ﬁltering criteria on the data set. All XRT ob-
servations were taken in the most sensitive photon counting
mode and we use the standard grade selection of 0−12. The
calibrated and cleaned event ﬁles are summed to generate en-
ergy spectra. The source spectra are extracted from a circu-
lar region centered at the source and having a radii of 47′′,
whereas, the background events are selected from an annu-
lar region centered at the source position and having inner
and outer radii as 55′′ and 110′′, respectively. We combined
the exposure maps using the tool XIMAGE and ancillary re-
sponse ﬁles are created with xrtmkarf to account for vi-
gnetting and PSF corrections. Due to low photon statistics,
to perform spectral analysis, we rebinned the spectra to en-
sure a minimum of 1 count per bin and use Cash statistics
(Cash 1979). An absorbed power law (neutral hydrogen col-
umn density NH = 2.91 × 1020 cm−2; Kalberla et al. 2005)
model is used to perform the ﬁtting within XSPEC (Arnaud
1996).

The observations from Swift-UVOT are integrated using the
task uvotimsum. Source counts are extracted from a 5′′ cir-
cular region centered at the target and background is extracted
from a larger area free from source contamination. The source
magnitudes are extracted with the task uvotsource. Ob-
served magnitudes are then de-reddened for galactic extinc-
tion (Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner 2011). The conversion from cor-
rected magnitudes to ﬂux units is done using the zero points
and conversion factors of Breeveld et al. (2011).

2.3. Optical monitoring Observations

The γ-NLSy1 galaxy SBS 0846+513 was observed on a to-
tal of six nights between 2012 November and 2013 March
as part of our ongoing campaign on NLSy1 galaxies. Three
nights of observations were carried out on the 1.3 m telescope
located at Devasthal and operated by Aryabhatta Research In-
stitute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), India. Another
three nights of monitoring was done using the 2 m Himalayan
Chandra Telescope at the Indian Astronomical Observatory,
located at Hanle, India. All the observations were taken in
the R band. We follow the standard procedures in IRAF3
to perform pre-processing of the images (e.g., bias subtrac-
tion, ﬂat-ﬁelding, and cosmic ray removal). The instrumental
magnitudes of the target and comparison stars are derived by
aperture photometry, using the phot task available within the
APPHOT package in IRAF. Following the procedures out-

3 IRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories,
which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astron-
omy, Inc. under co-operative agreement with the National Science Founda-
tion.

lined in Stalin et al. (2004), we derived the optimum aperture
radius for photometric analysis. First, we generate star−star
differential light curves for a series of aperture radii beginning
from the median seeing FWHM of that night. The aperture
that corresponds to the minimum scatter for the different pairs
of comparison stars is selected as the optimum aperture. The
positions and apparent magnitudes of the comparison stars
(taken from USNO2) used in the differential photometry, are
provided in Table 1. It should be noted that uncertainty in the
magnitudes of the comparison stars, taken from this catalog,
may be up to ∼0.25 mag (Monet et al. 2003).

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Average γ-ray spectra

The seven years averaged Fermi-LAT data of SBS
0846+513 is ﬁtted with both power law (PL) and log parabola
(LP) models and the obtained results are presented in Ta-
ble 2. As can be seen, the ﬁtting of the PL model indi-
cates a relatively harder γ-ray spectrum of SBS 0846+513
(Γ0.1−300 GeV = 2.23 ± 0.03) compared to other γ-NLSy1
galaxies (Paliya et al. 2015). The ∼7 years average γ-ray
ﬂux is (3.79 ± 0.16) × 10−8 ph cm−2 s−1 and this corre-
sponds to an isotropic γ-ray luminosity (Lγ) of ∼4 × 1046
erg s−1. Such a high Lγ is typically observed from FSRQs
(e.g., Ackermann et al. 2015). The associated signiﬁcance of
detection is ∼50σ (TS ≈2635). Moreover, ﬁtting of the LP
model hints for the presence of curvature in the γ-ray spec-
trum (β = 0.11 ± 0.02, TS ≈ 2650). In general, powerful FS-
RQs exhibit a curved γ-ray spectrum (e.g., Acero et al. 2015)
and this indicates the similarity of SBS 0846+513 with FS-
RQs.

3.2. Multi-wavelength temporal properties

The long term multi-wavelength temporal behavior of SBS
0846+513 is presented in Figure 1. In this plot, the Fermi-
LAT data points are weekly binned and Swift observations
are shown as one point per observation Id. Multiple episodes
of γ-ray ﬂares are visible and it appears from the available
observations that the object brightened at other frequencies
also during the period of high γ-ray activity, though it could
not be statistically established due to sparseness of the data.
The details of these γ-ray ﬂaring behaviors are already de-
scribed in Paliya et al. (2015) and here we concentrate more
on the multi-frequency properties of SBS 0846+513. From
the multi-wavelength light curves, we select two high activ-
ity periods (F1 and F2) and a quiescent period (Q) for further
analysis and SED modeling. The choice of selecting the pe-
riods is driven by the availability of multi-frequency data. As
can be seen in Figure 1, observations at lower frequencies are
not available during the ﬁrst ﬂare of SBS 0846+513 (before
MJD 55800), and thus, this ﬂaring period is not considered for
SED analysis. On the other hand, ﬂares during the periods F1
and F2 are simultaneously observed by Swift, thus providing
an unique opportunity to study them in detail. Interestingly,
visual inspection of Figure 1 suggests that the amplitude of
γ-ray variability during the periods F1 and F2 seems similar,
however, the source appeared brighter during the later period
in low frequency Swift observations.

3.3. Spectral energy distribution

2 http://www.nofs.navy.mil/data/fchpix/

We generate SEDs for all three periods under consideration
(Figure 1) by averaging the ﬂuxes over each time intervals. In
Table 3, we present the associated ﬂux values obtained from
this analysis. We model the SEDs by adopting an one zone
leptonic emission model described in Ghisellini & Tavecchio
(2009) and Dermer et al. (2009) and here we describe it in
brief. The emission region is assumed to be spherical, moving
relativistically with bulk Lorentz factor Γ at a distance Rdiss
from the central black hole of mass MBH. The semi opening
angle of the conical jet is considered as 0.1 rad and the size of
the emission region is constrained by assuming it to cover the
entire cross-section of the jet. The emission region is ﬁlled
with the electrons following a smoothly joining broken power
law of the form

N ′(γ ′) = N ′

0

(γ ′

brk)−p

(γ ′/γ ′

brk)p + (γ ′/γ ′

brk)q

(1)

where p and q are the energy indices before and after the
brk) respectively (primed quantities are mea-
break energy (γ ′
sured in the comoving frame). The accretion disk radiation
is modeled by assuming a standard optically thick, geometri-
cally thin Shakura & Sunyaev (1973) disk. Locally, its spec-
trum is assumed as that emitted by a multi-temperature an-
nular blackbody. The broad line region (BLR) is considered
as a spherical shell reprocessing 10% of the disk luminosity
and emits like a blackbody peaking at the rest-frame Lyman-
α frequency (Tavecchio & Ghisellini 2008). The size of the
1/2
BLR is assumed to follow the relation RBLR = 1017L
disk,45
cm, where Ldisk,45 is the accretion disk luminosity in units
of 1045 erg s−1 (Ghisellini & Tavecchio 2009). In our model,
the presence of the dusty torus is also considered which repro-
cesses 50% of the accretion disk emission at IR frequencies.
For simplicity, it is assumed to be a thin spherical shell and its
emission is considered as a simple blackbody peaking at the
temperature TIR. The size of the torus, similar to BLR, scales
with the square root of the disk luminosity and assumed to
1/2
follow the relation RIR = 1018L
d,45 cm. In the comoving
frame, the radiation energy densities of all the components
are computed at the distance Rdiss from the central black hole
following Ghisellini & Tavecchio (2009). The electrons radi-
ate via synchrotron and inverse Compton scattering processes
in the presence of a tangled but uniform magnetic ﬁeld. The
synchrotron and synchrotron self Compton (SSC) radiations
are derived in the observer’s frame, using the prescriptions of
Finke et al. (2008). Along with SSC, photons from external
components such as the accretion disk, the BLR, and the torus
also participate in the IC scattering (e.g., Dermer et al. 2009;
Ghisellini & Tavecchio 2009). The jet powers are calculated
following Celotti & Ghisellini (2008). Protons are assumed
to carry only the inertia of the jet and do not contribute to
the observed radiation. Furthermore, it should be noted that
based on Hβ line parameters, Shen et al. (2011) estimated the
black hole mass of SBS 0846+513 as ∼9.77 × 107 M⊙. The
broadband SED of this object does not show any evidence for
the presence of the big blue bump (a characteristic signature
of the accretion disk emission), so the observed optical spec-
trum probably has signiﬁcant contamination from jet emis-
sion not taken into account in Shen et al. (2011), and there-
fore these estimates should be taken with caution. Recently
Foschini et al. (2015) have performed a detailed optical spec-
troscopic analysis of a sample of NLSy1 galaxies, including
SBS 0846+513. They used the Hβ line luminosity, instead of

4

Paliya et al.

continuum at 5100 ˚A, to derive MBH and thus were able to
avoid the ﬂux contamination from the host galaxy and the jet.
They found MBH of SBS 0846+513 as 3.2 × 107 M⊙. We re-
produce the observed optical-UV part of the SED with a com-
bination of the accretion disk model and synchrotron emission
in such a manner so as not to overproduce the observations.
With this, we derive a black hole mass as MBH =5.5 × 107
M⊙ and the disk luminosity as Ldisk =1 × 1044 erg s−1. Our
MBH estimation, via SED modeling, agrees within a factor of
two to that derived by Foschini et al. (2015) and therefore, is
reliable.

The modeled SEDs are shown in Figure 2 and the associ-
ated modeling parameters are given in Table 4. In Figure 2,
the red squares represent the simultaneous observations from
Swift and Fermi-LAT and grey circles correspond to archival
data4.

As can be seen in Figure 2, the SED of SBS 0846+513 has
a typical double hump structure, similar to blazars. The syn-
chrotron radiation dominates the observed optical-UV spectra
in all the activity states and the contribution from the accretion
disk is negligible. This is supported by the detection of a high
optical polarization (>10%) during the 2013 April ﬂare (as-
sociated here with F2 state) of SBS 0846+513 (Maune et al.
2014). Also, the observed optical-UV spectrum is extremely
steep which is difﬁcult to explain by accretion disk model.
A high synchrotron emission indicates a high level of SSC
emission which is evident in Figure 2. A ﬂat X-ray spectrum
is observed which is successfully explained by SSC mecha-
nism. We observed a relatively hard γ-ray spectrum in both
the ﬂaring states (see Table 3) which, according to our model,
is reproduced by the EC-BLR process. Visual inspection sug-
gests for the possible existence of a break in the γ-ray spec-
trum which we interpret as a consequence of EC-BLR peak
to lie within the LAT energy range. From SED modeling of
both the ﬂaring periods, we constrain the location of the emis-
sion region to be at the outer edge of the BLR where a major
contribution of the seed photons for IC scattering is provided
by BLR clouds. These results are different from that obtained
by D’Ammando et al. (2012, 2013) where the γ-ray emission
is explained on the basis of EC-torus mechanism and the lo-
cation of the emission region was constrained to be far out
from the BLR. Since the emission region is located relatively
closer in our case, the derived magnetic ﬁelds are higher and
the size of the emission regions are smaller compared to them.
On the other hand, during the low activity state we found the
emission region to be located within the BLR.

3.4. Intra-night optical variability

We observed SBS 0846+513 on a total of six nights be-
tween 2012 November to 2013 March, using the 2m Hi-
malayan Chandra Telescope and the 1.3 m telescope at Dev-
asthal. The differential light curves of the NLSy1 galaxy rel-
ative to each of the two comparison stars and the comparison
stars themselves are shown in Figure 3. The source is consid-
ered as variable only when it shows correlated variations both
in time and amplitude relative to the selected pair of com-
parison stars. To quantify INOV, we use two statistical tests,
C-statistics and F-statistics. The C parameter is deﬁned as
follows

C =

σT
σCS

(2)

4 http://tools.asdc.asi.it/SED/

where σT and σCS are the standard deviations of the source
and the comparison star differential light curves, respectively.
The source is considered to have shown INOV if C ≥2.576,
which corresponds to 99% conﬁdence level (Jang & Miller
1997). On the other hand, the method of F-statistics takes
into account the ratio of two variances given as

F =

σ2
T
σ2

CS

(3)

T is the variance of source-comparison star differen-
where σ2
tial light curves and σ2
CS is the variance of the comparison
star-star differential light curves. We then compare the de-
rived F values with critical F value, Fα
ν , where α is the signif-
icance level5 and ν (= Np− 1) is the degree of freedom for the
light curve. We assume the source to be variable only if both
the computed F values, with respect to the differential light
curves of the source to each of the two comparison stars, are
greater than the critical F value. The results of F and C statis-
tics are given in Table 5. It should be noted that C-statistics
might be a more appropriate quantity to check for the pres-
ence of variability, especially when the comparison star light
curves are not steady. Further, we have not found any cor-
relation between the variability pattern of full width at half
maximum (FWHM) of the point source with that observed in
the source light curves. Therefore we conclude that the ob-
served INOV are true ﬂux variations of SBS 0846+513. As
can be seen in Figure 3 and also in Table 5, the source has
shown signiﬁcant ﬂux variations on all the nights. This sug-
gests a duty cycle of 100%, using both C and F statistics. The
duty cycle is deﬁned as the ratio of the time over which the
object shows ﬂux variations to the total observing time. It is
calculated as follows

DC = 100

Pn
i=1 Ni(1/∆ti)
Pn

i=1(1/∆ti)

%,

(4)

where ∆ti = ∆ti,obs(1 + z)−1 is the duration of the moni-
toring session of a source on the ith night, corrected for the
redshift z. Ni is equal to 1 if INOV is detected and other-
wise 0. Considering the INOV patterns exhibited by other
γ-NLSy1 galaxies, studied in our earlier work (Paliya et al.
2013a, 2014), the overall duty cycle for γ-NLSy1 galaxies is
found to be 55% and 81%, according to C and F statistics,
respectively. Such high amplitude (ψ >3%), high duty cy-
cle (∼70%) INOV are generally seen in the BL Lac objects
(e.g., Stalin et al. 2004). This supports the idea that the INOV
characteristics of γ-NLSy1 galaxies are similar to blazars.

An interesting phenomenon is the observation of INOV be-
havior of a source during the γ-ray ﬂaring period. It has been
shown by Paliya et al. (2014), based on the results of another
γ-NLSy1 galaxy 1H 0323+342, that the chances of detect-
ing large amplitude INOV are higher during the γ-ray ﬂar-
ing period. Coincidentally, one of the INOV observations
reported here (2013 March 11) was taken during one of the
γ-ray ﬂares of SBS 0846+513 (period F2). During this night,
the brightness of the source ﬁrst decreased by ∼0.3 magni-
tude and then increased by a similar amount within ∼7 hrs.
(see Figure3). As can be seen in this plot, on top of the large
ﬂare, many small amplitude but fast variations are also visible.
Such fast INOV features are also seen in the γ-NLSy1 galax-
ies 1H 0323+342 and PMN J0948+0022 (Paliya et al. 2013a,

during γ-ray ﬂaring activity, and consequently argue for a jet
based origin for the observed INOV.

4. CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we present a multi-wavelength study of the
γ-ray emitting NLSy1 galaxy SBS 0846+513. The INOV ob-
servations reported here are new and the observation on any
particular night span more than ﬁve hours. We summarize our
ﬁndings below.

1. The multi-wavelength light curves of the source show
multiple episodes of γ-ray ﬂaring activities which are
also reﬂected in lower frequency observations. How-
ever, the existence of close correlation between γ-ray
and X-ray wavelengths could not be statistically con-
ﬁrmed due to the sparseness of the data.

2. A statistically signiﬁcant curvature is noticed in the
seven years averaged LAT spectrum of SBS 0846+513,
a feature generally seen in the γ-ray spectra of powerful
FSRQs.

3. The broadband SEDs of SBS 0846+513 show the typ-
ical double hump structure, similar to blazars, with a
steep optical and a relatively hard γ-ray spectrum.

4. The modeling of the SEDs with a one zone leptonic
emission model indicates the optical-UV spectrum to
be dominated by synchrotron emission, whereas, the X-
ray spectra are well explained by SSC process. The γ-
ray regions of the SEDs are explained by IC scattering
of BLR photons. It is found that during both the ﬂaring
activity states, the emission region was located at the
outer edge of the BLR, while during the low activity
state it was well within the BLR.

5. Signiﬁcant INOV is noticed on all the six nights of
ground based optical observations.
Interestingly, a
large amplitude INOV is seen during the γ-ray ﬂaring
period F2.
