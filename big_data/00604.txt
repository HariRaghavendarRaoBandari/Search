INTRODUCTION

The top quark is generally considered as a sensitive probe to physics beyond the stan-

dard model (BSM)[1], with its large mass close to the electroweak symmetry breaking

scale. Transitions between top quarks and other quark ﬂavours mediated by neutral

gauge bosons, the ﬂavour-changing neutral-currents (FCNC), are forbidden at tree level

in the Standard Model (SM) and suppressed at the level of quantum loop due to the

Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism[2]. The branching ratios for the processes
t → qγ and t → qg are of the order of 10−14 − 10−12 in the SM [3, 4]. In contrast, sev-
eral BSM scenarios, such as the two-Higgs doublet model, supersymmetry or technicolor,
predict much larger rates [5, 6] of the order of 10−6 − 10−5. It implies that observation of
the large FCNC-induced couplings tqγ and tqg would indicate the existence of BSM.

The enhanced FCNC tqγ and tqg interactions are predicted by many extensions of the

SM which include new exotic quarks [7], new scalars [8, 9], supersymmetry [5, 10–14], or

technicolour [6, 15]. The BSM eﬀects can be described by a minimal set of the higher order

eﬀective operators independently from the underlying theory [16]. The eﬀective operators

not only simplify multiple free parameters of speciﬁc models in a model-independent way,

but also order them and allow us to consistently take into account higher-order quantum

corrections. This method appears in many studies to search top-quark FCNC [17–37]. It

can facilitate the analysis of new physics eﬀects in tqγ and tqg interactions. So we can

give limits on the strength of anomalous top couplings in a model-independent way. The

most general eﬀective Lagrangian can be written as

the strength of anomalous couplings tqV with V = γ, g and q = u, c.

Among FCNC top quark decays, t → qg is very diﬃcult to distinguish from generic
multijet production via quantum chromodynamics (QCD). It has therefore been suggested

to search for FCNC couplings in anomalous single top-quark production. The existence of

anomalous couplings tqγ and tqg would induce production of a top quark in association
with a photon, pp → tγ + X. Next-to-leading order QCD predictions for this process
have been studied in [24, 33]. This process has been probed at the CMS experiment, as

yet, with no indication of any signal. The stronger bounds on the strengths of anomalous

√

couplings have been provided by the LHC experiments with

s = 8 TeV [38, 39]. We use

the CMS results and try to predict the discovery potential of LHC-RunII.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the limits on anomalous top couplings by

considering tγ production. Unlike previous studies of tγ production, we focus on a detailed

analysis based on the complete simulation. In addition, we discuss the sensitivity of LHC-

RunII to anomalous top couplings and detection potential lower limits on the tqγ and tqg

couplings.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we provide the cross sections

of tγ production at LHC-RunII. The simulation of signal and the expected backgrounds

is discussed in detail. At the end of this section, we discuss the contribution of single

top production with a photon radiation oﬀ the top decay products. In section III, we

analyze the sensitivity of LHC-RunII to anomalous top couplings in detail. The limits

on the branching ratios of top quarks into lighter quarks and photons or gluons are given

correspondingly. Finally we summarize our results in section IV.

II. ANOMALOUS TOP COUPLINGS AND tγ PRODUCTION AT LHC

In this section we ﬁrst study tγ production with the on-shell top quark in the ﬁnal

state, and then discuss the signal and background events for two channels γjjb and γ(cid:96)νb

depending on the W decay mode. A realistic and detailed analysis is presented, including

object identiﬁcation and event selection.

A.

tγ production

From the general eﬀective Lagrangian Lef f as shown in Eq.(1), one can see that anoma-
lous couplings tqγ and tqg induce the process pp → tγ. The tγ production provides the
opportunity to probe both anomalous tuV and tcV couplings. Less sensitivity to tcV

couplings is expected due to the large enhancement of the charm quark parton distri-

bution function (PDF). Therefore, we consider that each type of interaction, tuγ, tcγ

and tug, tcg, should be treated independently.

In our analysis, we take Λ as the top

quark mass, mt = 173.2 GeV, αs = 0.108, α = 1/128.92 and a simpliﬁed scenario with
κL
tqγ = κR

tqγ = κtqγ and κL

tqg = κR

tqg = κtqg.

The presence of anomalous couplings tqγ and tqg lead to the single top production in

association with an energetic photon by two main mechanisms related to the strong and

weak sector. This process can take place through the s- and t-channel. The corresponding

Feynman diagrams are shown in Fig. 1. The eﬀective cross sections σ(s) can be evaluated

from ˆσ(ˆs) by convoluting with fq1/p(x1) and fq2/p(x2),

t /s. For the quark distribution functions fq1/p(x1) and fq2/p(x2),

we will use the form given by the leading order parton distribution function CTEQ6L1

[40].

The eﬀective Lagrangian is implemented in FeynRules [41] and subsequently passed

to MadGraph 5 [42] framework by means of UFO module [43]. We assume that only one

anomalous top coupling is nonzero. It is worth mentioning that if the photon is collinear

to the initial quark, the cross section will have a divergence. To avoid this divergence,
we set a minimum transverse momentum cut on emitted photons, pγ

T > 50 GeV which is

adopted by CMS collaboration. In this case, the tγ cross section for LHC-RunII are

(cid:12)(cid:12)κtuγ|2 (pb) ,
(cid:12)(cid:12)κtcγ|2 (pb) ,
(cid:12)(cid:12)κtug|2 (pb) ,
(cid:12)(cid:12)κtcg|2 (pb) .

σtγ(κtuγ) = 144.4

σtγ(κtcγ) = 13.7

σtγ(κtug) = 401.6

σtγ(κtcg) = 55.7

(3)

Obviously, the cross sections of tγ production only depend on the strengths of anomalous

top couplings κtqγ and κtqg.

There are many alternatives for normalisation of coupling constants in Lef f . The
experimental results always use branching ratios. In order to compare with them, we will

show our results by using branching ratios of top quark. In our analysis, the width of
t → W b is assumed to be approximately top quark total width. The LO prediction for
decay width of top quark decay to a bottom quark and a W boson is [44]

We plot the cross section of tγ production at LHC-RunII originating from diﬀerent

anomalous couplings tqV versus the FCNC branching ratios in Fig.2. From Fig.2, we can

see that the cross sections of anomalous tγ production increase with the FCNC branching

ratios increasing. Experimental limits on the branching ratios of the rare top quark decays

were established by experiments of top producion at the LEP, HERA, Tevatron and LHC

accelerators [38, 39, 45–50]. At present the most stringent upper limits at 95% conﬁdence

level (CL) from diﬀerent sensitive channels are shown in Table I. Using the upper limits

on the branching ratios by the CMS experiment,

BR(t → uγ) < 1.61 × 10−4, BR(t → cγ) < 1.82 × 10−3,
BR(t → ug) < 3.55 × 10−4, BR(t → cg) < 3.44 × 10−3,

we obtain the limits on the cross section in Fig.2. Then we use Eq.3 to calculate the

(10)

For numerical estimation, we take coupling constants κtuγ = 0.001, κtcγ = 0.003, κtug =

0.01 and κtcg = 0.02 in the following signal simulation.

The light jet would be misidentiﬁed as b-jet (or photon) candidate and therefore

W γ+jets events will be one of backgrounds with a fake b-jet. Similarly, W +jets will

contribute to backgrounds if two jets are misidentiﬁed as an isolated photon and a b-jet

simultaneously, respectively. For the background events with more than one b-jet (such
as t¯t, t¯t + γ events), we only take into account t¯t because of its large cross section at LHC.

The measurement accuracy of the hadronic calorimeter is not enough to distinguish the

W or Z boson. Thereby, Zγ+jets process contributes to backgrounds, which is larger
than others SM background processes such as single top+γ, t¯t + γ, Drell-Yan and Di-

7

boson+γ+jets. The contributions of W γ+jets, W +jets, t¯t and Zγ+jets events are all

estimated from simulation as the SM background processes.

For the fully hadronic ﬁnal state, the overwhelming QCD multijet backgrounds are

large. We consider the main QCD backgrounds jjjj and bjjj for the signal state γjjb.

However, the background could be signiﬁcantly suppressed after a series of cuts.

We apply the basic selection cuts on the ﬁnal states for two kinds of signals, γjjb and

γ(cid:96)νb. One of the distinctive signatures of the signal is the presence of a high-pT photon

in the ﬁnal state. The photon is expected to carry large momentum because of the recoil

against the heavy top quark. Photon candidates with signiﬁcant energy are required to
have transverse momentum pT ≥ 50 GeV with |η|≤ 2.5, using the CMS coordinate system
presented [51]. Only jets with pT > 30 GeV within |η|≤ 2.5 are considered in our analysis.
(∆η)2 + (∆φ)2 < 0.4 around the photon
Additionally, the particle ﬂow isolation ∆R =

(cid:112)

candidate is applied, where ∆η is the rapidity gap and ∆φ is the azimuthal angle gap

between the particle pair. These cuts on photon insure the events with exactly one photon

candidate. In order to have well separated physical objects and remove radiated photons

from high pT leptons or ﬁnal state partons, it is required that ∆R(jet,γ) > 0.7 and

∆R(lepton,γ) > 0.7. The isolation criteria are corrected for the eﬀects of pile-up and

underlying events, and more details can be found in [38].

The average eﬃciency of single photon reaches 91%, and the probability for jets to re-

construct a single photon candidate in the electromagnetic calorimeter is about 0.1% [52].

To distinguish between b-jets and light ﬂavor jets, b-tagging algorithm is used with the

eﬃciency of about 70%. The misidentiﬁcation probability of light quarks or gluons as

b-jets is approximately 1.5%, which is given by the CMS collaboration [53].

In order to simulate signal and background events more realistically at the parton level,

we imitate the experimental conditions with the Gaussian resolution parametrization

where δ(E)/E is the energy resolution, a is a sampling term, b is a constant term, and

a = 100%, b = 5% for jets[54]. For simplicity we assume that the energy smearing for

muon is the same as electron.

smearing at LHC-RunII.

Although the photon and b-jet pT cut have good separation power to reduce the eﬀect

of soft jets from underlying events and pile-up, we also need other variables to reduce hard

process backgrounds. The angular separation ∆R between the b-jet and lepton (or jet)

could distinguish signal from backgrounds. It shows whether the W and b-jet, the former

decay into jet or lepton, come from the same particle (top). So we display the distribution

of ∆R(b-jet,jet) for γjjb and ∆R(b-jet,lepton) for γ(cid:96)νb in Fig.3. It is gratifying that this
variable can partly discriminate between signal and the t¯t background events, although
b-jet and lepton (or jet) are from the same one. In t¯t events, if the fake photons take
the same pT as the photons in signal, ¯t will carry more energy than signal photon. The
momentum of the other top quark in t¯t events should be smaller than that of signal
top quark, causing angular separation between the top quark decay products larger in t¯t

backgrounds than that in signal. From Fig.3, we ﬁnd ∆R(b-jet,jet) and ∆R(b-jet,lepton)

should be less than 2.5 as one of the kinematical cuts.

In the following discussion, we employ other kinematical cuts, the mass windows of

reconstructed W and top quark, to reduce backgrounds to a controlled level for γjjb and

γ(cid:96)νb.

1. The γjjb signal

The hadronic W decay is the main decay channel. Thus, although the leptonic W

decay can give a more clean signal, the γjjb signal is also worth of pondering.

Zγ+jets background events, and two jets in W +jets. If there is any jet more than these,

the extra ones should be missed by a small pT . However, there is no neutrino in the signal

but missing energy (extra jets) in backgrounds. The events with extra jets could be well

cut by the missing transverse momentum /ET or jet number. In our discussion, we only

consider the background events with no extra jet for γjjb.

FIG. 4: Normalized m(jj) (left) and m(jjb) (right) distributions before the kinematical cuts

for γjjb signal at LHC-RunII.

After basic cuts, we illustrate the distribution of reconstructed W mass for the γjjb

signal and backgrounds at 14 TeV in Fig.4. From the left ﬁgure, it is evident that a proper

mass window of W rapidly reduces the Zγ+jets backgrounds while aﬀecting the signal
slightly. However, for W γ+jets, W +jets or t¯t, due to the same origin of two jets as the

signal, the invariant mass m(jj) alone is weak and ineﬀective to distinguish signal from

backgrounds. Therefore, we subsequently reconstruct the top mass of two jets and a b-jet

to further suppress backgrounds. The right one in Fig.4 shows a sharp peaky distribution
for signal and the t¯t background with a maximum close to the top mass, while the other

background events distribute in a broad invariant mass region. The diﬀerence is due to

the b-jets in the W +jets, W γ+jets and Zγ+jets backgrounds coming from misidentiﬁed

jets which makes the invariant mass m(jjb) smaller than mt.

In order to reduce backgrounds, we require the invariant mass of the two jets to peak

at the W mass within a mass window of 15 GeV, as the following range,

|m(jj) − mW| < 15 GeV,

and further require the invariant mass m(jjb) to be around the top quark mass window,

|m(jjb) − mt| < 25 GeV.

(13)

The cuts in Eq.11 and Eq.12 can reduce almost 80% W +jets, W γ+jets and Zγ+jets
background events and nearly 20% signal and t¯t background events. As previously
discussed, the t¯t is well cut by the ∆R(b-jet,lepton) requirement. So we apply ∆R(b-

jet,lepton)< 2.5. Then we take into account the b-tagging eﬃciency and mistagging rates.

After these event selection, the cross sections for the γjjb signal and backgrounds are

listed in Table II with the same parameter value as before. It is obvious that our scheme

of event selection can signiﬁcantly suppress backgrounds.

number of the signal and background events, respectively. For our coupling constants

hypothesis, it gives a statistical signiﬁcance of 2.03 at LHC-RunII with an integrated

luminosity of 100 fb−1. In section III, we will discuss the sensitivity of anomalous top

couplings for this signal in detail.

2. The γ(cid:96)νb signal

The signal events are in general characterized by the presence of an isolated charged

leptons (electrons or muons) together with a photon, missing transverse energy, and one b-

jet. Although the production cross section for this signal is smaller than γjjb, the presence

of lepton and photon provides a clean signal, which is attractive from the experimental

11

point of view. Moreover, (σ((cid:96)+)/σ((cid:96)−)) can be used to determine whether tγ production

comes from the up quark or charm quark initiated process [26, 55].

It provides the

opportunity to understand the underlying new physics.

FIG. 5: Normalized m((cid:96)ν) and m((cid:96)νb) distributions for the γ(cid:96)νb signal at LHC-RunII.

Events are preselected by requiring exactly the isolated charged leptons with a trans-
verse momentum pT ≥ 20 GeV and a pseudorapidity |η| ≤ 2.5. For the leptons, we only
consider an electron and a muon in the signal simulation. The lepton-tagging eﬃciency

is about l = 90%. The missing transverse momentum /ET is required to be greater than

30 GeV. The parameters of anomalous top couplings in Fig.5 are taken the same as the

γjjb signal.

The lepton with neutrino in the γ(cid:96)νb signal comes from W boson decay. For Zγ+jets

background, one of the jets is reconstructed to a b-jet and the other(s) should be missed.
Similarly, one daughter-lepton of Z needs to be missed. Because the lepton cut is pT ≥
20 GeV, the transverse energy of the missing lepton is required to be smaller than 20 GeV.

The missing transverse momentum should satisfy /ET > 30 GeV, which is reconstructed

by one or more missing jets and one missing lepton. So there must be more than one jet

in the ﬁnal state of Zγ+jets backgrounds. In view of the small tag eﬃciency, we only

consider Zγjj and Zγjjj backgrounds.

The W mass window can rapidly reduce Zγ+jets backgrounds while aﬀecting the

signal slightly. The normalized invariant mass distribution of the lepton and neutrino

(missed jets for Zγ+jets) with the basic cuts is shown in Fig.5 (left). In order to further

suppress other backgrounds, we subsequently reconstruct the mass of the top, and the

normalized invariant mass distribution of the m((cid:96)νb) spectrum are shown in Fig.5 (right).

III, the sets of cuts signiﬁcantly suppress the backgrounds. The statistical signiﬁcance

can reach 12.28 at LHC-RunII with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb−1 with the κtqγ and

κtqg corresponding to what mentioned earlier. There will be a detailed discussion about

the sensitivity of anomalous top couplings in the next section.

C. The contribution of photon radiation to signal

For the signal of anomalous top couplings tqg, tγ associated production is not the only
contribution to γjjb and γ(cid:96)νb. The additional feynman diagrams for qg → γf ¯f b are
depicted in Fig.6. They correspond to direct top production and photon radiation of the

association with a photon through tqg vertices.

b quark, W boson and W decay products, respectively. The existence of these processes

allow to test whether it is induced by strong interactions. Therefore, it is a necessary

probe to research the top-quark FCNC as a supplementary.

In [20], the author calculated the contributions of the radiation process to total cross

sections which has not been taken into account in previous literature. But they only con-

sidered the transverse momentum cut on photon so that their conclusion is too optimistic.

We take account of basic cuts on b-jet and lepton (or jet) to examine the contributions of
the radiation process. By setting basic cuts and pγ

T > 15, we present the cross sections of

additional feynman diagrams with the strengths of anomalous top couplings in Fig.7.

FIG. 7: The cross sections of the radiation process induced by couplings tug (left) and tcg

(right) with pγ

T > 15 GeV.

After setting our basic cuts, we note that this part of contributions to total cross section

have a rapid decrease with the photon transverse momentum increasing. When pγ

T > 5, for

γjjb (γ(cid:96)νb), the total cross section which contains the contributions of radiation processes

When pγ

T > 40,

the contributions of additional feynman diagrams to the cross section quickly decrease to

less than 10% of tγ production with subsequent top decay. Thus we conclude that the
contributions from tγ production with subsequent top decay dominate in part of pγ

T > 50.

Nevertheless, the contributions from these additional feynman diagrams could help us to

seach for top FCNC process when relatively small transverse momentum cut on photon

is imposed.

In this case, it is necessary to consider not only the ﬁnal states of a top

quark plus a photon but also the ﬁnal state particles reconstructing a top quark. Thus
we present the normalized m(f ¯f b) and m(γf ¯f b) distributions for the γf ¯f b in Fig.8.

III. SENSITIVITY OF ANOMALOUS TOP COUPLINGS AT LHC-RUNII

In this section, we study the sensitivity of anomalous couplings through the tγ pro-

duction at LHC-RunII. For an adequate signal modelling, the photon radiation from top

quark decay products is taken into account. The sensitivity of four anomalous top cou-

plings at LHC-RunII which is deﬁned as S/

S + B (as shown above) are presented in

Fig.9. The SS is obtained with the selection strategy for high signal eﬃciency. In the case

of assuming a single non-vanishing coupling at a time, four choices of anomalous coupling

parameters are subsequently ﬁtted by polynomial functions so that 3σ and 5σ discovery

ranges are extracted. Assuming that LHC-RunII could collect an integrated luminosity

Obviously, the γ(cid:96)νb signal is more sensitive than γjjb. For hadronic ﬁnal state, the

overwhelming QCD multijet backgrounds make the FCNC coupling constants looser.

Thus the γ(cid:96)νb is the better signal to search for anomalous couplings at LHC-RunII with

an integrated luminosity of 100 fb−1.

Actually, we allow for a set of non-vanishing couplings simultaneously, either in the

weak sector (non-vanishing κtuγ and κtcγ) or in the strong sector (non-vanishing κtug and

reach a given statistical signiﬁcance, we plot the associated 3σ and 5σ discovery reaches

in κtuγ-κtcγ (κtug-κtcg) planes for γ(cid:96)νb at LHC-RunII in Fig.10. We observe a better

sensitivity to ﬂavor-changing interactions with an up quark than with a charm quark, as

expected from parton densities, the charm content of the proton being suppressed with

respect to its up content.

FIG. 10: Excluded 3σ and 5σ detection potential regions for the γ(cid:96)νb signal in weak (left) and

strong (right) sector at LHC-RunII.

Since both tqγ and tqg operators contribute to the same ﬁnal state, the interference

eﬀects should be considered. If κtuγ = κtcγ = κtqγ, κtug = κtcg = κtqg, for pγ

T > 50 GeV,

the total tγ cross section with contributions of tqγ and tqg operators is

By applying the same selection strategy described as above, we presented excluded

LHC-RunII detection potential regions for the γ(cid:96)νb signal

in tqγ and tqg plane in

Fig.11. Compared to existing researches about tZ production and same-sign top quark

production[27, 32], our results give more sensitive constraints on top anomalous couplings

via tγ production.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Many of the extensions of the SM predict that the tree level FCNC processes could

exist. With Run-II of the LHC, more and more measurements in the top-quark sector

will be explored with an unprecedented precision. Measurements of single top production

allow us to search for deviations from the SM predictions. While these deviations are

often interpreted in terms of anomalous top couplings. The possible deviations can be

described by the eﬀects of eﬀective operators, and experimental results can be used to

determine useful constraints on each eﬀective operator. The established deviations can

then be evolved up to high scales, and matched to possible new physics scenarios.

In this paper, we have investigated FCNC couplings tqγ and tqg in a model independent

way. These interactions lead to possibly signiﬁcant production rates for γjjb and γ(cid:96)νb

signals via tγ associated production with subsequent decay. We have considered the

contribution of the single top production with photon radiation oﬀ the top decay products
to this process. This contribution dominate when pγ

T is small, and it quickly decrease with

the photon transverse momentum increasing. For the cuts we took here, as the CMS and

ATLAS experiments presented, the contribution of this process has little eﬀect on the
results. While for smaller pγ

T cut, this process could be useful. Once tγ production

processes are eventually observed, the single top decay with photon radiation processes

could help us ﬁnd out whether or not the origin of the FCNC interactions is in the strong

sector.

We systematically considered various experimental requirements for our basic cuts.

Meanwhile, we employed the lepton, photon and b-tag eﬃciencies on signal and back-

tion, a detailed analysis of reconstruction and invariant mass distribution was performed

to improve the statistical signiﬁcance. Moreover, the sensitivities of LHC-RunII to anoma-

lous FCNC couplings tqγ and tqg were calculated for both the γjjb and γ(cid:96)νb signals. We

further discussed the interference eﬀects on the cross section from contributions of tqγ

and tqg operators. Then we presented excluded detection potential regions for the γ(cid:96)νb

signal. With an integrated luminosity of 100 fb−1 and

s = 14 TeV, for a 5σ discovery,

the needed strengths of tqγ and tqg couplings of order are down to 0.001-0.01. Equiva-
lently, the lower bounds on the associated rare top branching ratios are O(0.001 − 0.1)%
which are one order of magnitude tighter than the ones from LHC experiments. We hope

our results could help search for the signal of anomalous top couplings at LHC-RunII in

operation.
