ABSTRACT

Context. Previous studies have shown the existence of an excess of emission at submillimeter (submm) and millimeter (mm) wave-
lengths in the spectral energy distribution (SED) of many low-metallicity galaxies. The so-called “submm excess”, whose origin
remains unknown, challenges our understanding of the dust properties in low-metallicity environments.
Aims. The goal of the present study is to model separately the emission from the star forming (SF) component and the emission from
the diﬀuse interstellar medium (ISM) in the nearby spiral galaxy M33, in order to check if both components can be well ﬁtted using
radiation transfer models or if there is an excess of submm emission associated to any or both of them.
Methods. We decomposed the observed SED of M33 into its SF and diﬀuse components. Mid-infrared (MIR) and far-infrared (FIR)
ﬂuxes were extracted from Spitzer and Herschel data. At submm and mm wavelengths, we used ground-based observations from
APEX to measure the emission from the SF component and data from the Planck space telescope to estimate the diﬀuse emission.
Both components were separately ﬁtted using radiation transfer models based on standard dust properties (i.e. emissivity index β=2)
and a realistic geometry. The large amount of previous studies helped us to estimate the thermal radio emission and to constrain an
important part of the input parameters of the models. Both modeled SEDs were combined to build the global SED of M33. In addition,
the radiation ﬁeld necessary to power the dust emission in our modeling was compared with observations from GALEX, Sloan, and
Spitzer.
Results. Our modeling is able to reproduce the observations at MIR and FIR wavelengths, but we found a strong excess of emission at
submm and mm wavelengths, where the model expectations severely underestimate the LABOCA and Planck ﬂuxes. We also found
that the ultraviolet (UV) radiation escaping the galaxy is 70% higher than the model predictions. From the total mass of dust derived
from our modeling and the mass of atomic and molecular gas measured with the VLA and the IRAM 30 m telescope, we determined
a gas-to-dust mass ratio Gdust∼100, signiﬁcantly lower than the value expected from the sub-solar metallicity of M33.
Conclusions. We discussed diﬀerent hypotheses to explain the discrepancies found in our study (i.e., excess of emission at submm
and mm wavelengths, deﬁcit of UV attenuation, and abnormally low value of Gdust), concluding that diﬀerent dust properties in M33
is the most plausible explanation.

1. Introduction

Dust grains are mixed with the gas in all the components
and phases of a galaxy, from the ionized gas and the photo-
dissociation regions (PDRs) embedded in the star forming (SF)
regions, to the diﬀuse interstellar medium (ISM). Depending on
their environment, dust grains are exposed to very diﬀerent ra-
diation ﬁelds and physical conditions. While the interstellar dust
within the SF component is immersed in the intense ultraviolet
(UV) radiation coming from massive, hot stars, dust grains in
the diﬀuse ISM are more likely illuminated by the radiation ﬁeld
of the old stellar population (Hippelein et al. 2003; Verley et al.
2009). These diﬀerences not only change the grain heating and
the subsequent emission, but also might change the grain prop-
erties (e.g., size distribution, chemical composition, ionization

state) and play an important role on the dust evolution (Hippelein
et al. 2003; Paradis et al. 2011).

Modeling the spectral energy distribution (SED) emitted by
the dust grains is a powerful tool to understand the grain prop-
erties as well as the interaction between the interstellar dust and
the radiation ﬁeld. One of the most simple approaches to model
the dust emission is the modiﬁed black body (MBB), where the
intensity, S ν, is expressed as:
S ν ∝ Bν(T) ν β,
where Bν(T) is the Planck function and β is the dust emissivity
index, which in the case of idealized spherical dielectric grains
adopts the value β=2. Although the MBB models are highly de-
generated (there is no unique solution for β and T, see Tabatabaei
et al. 2014 for a detailed analysis), they have been widely used

to study the dust emission (e.g., Kirkpatrick et al. 2013; Gordon
et al. 2014).

More sophisticated models have also been used, from phe-
nomenological models based on realistic dust properties (e.g.,
Galliano et al. 2011), to fully three-dimensional radiation trans-
fer models (Ercolano et al. 2005). Although the diﬀerent
methodologies applied make the comparison of these studies
somehow diﬃcult, many of them have shown that it is not pos-
sible to reproduce the SEDs of low-metallicity galaxies due to
an excess of observed emission at submillimeter (submm) wave-
lengths (e.g., Lisenfeld et al. 2002; Galliano et al. 2003, 2005;
Bendo et al. 2006; Galametz et al. 2009, 2011; Israel et al. 2010;
Bot et al. 2010; Dale et al. 2012; Planck Collaboration 2011).

The origin of this problem, usually known as the submm ex-
cess, is not clear yet. The existence of a large amount of cold dust
could in principle produce the observed shape, but the required
dust mass is unreasonably high (e.g., Lisenfeld et al. 2002) and
the gas-to-dust mass ratio too low (e.g., Galliano et al. 2011;
Galametz et al. 2011; Gordon et al. 2014). Diﬀerent dust grain
properties, and in particular a lower β in the submm have also
been suggested (e.g., Lisenfeld et al. 2002; Galliano et al. 2011;
Gordon et al. 2014). For example, if hydrogenated amorphous
carbon grains were the most probable form of carbonaceous
grains in the ISM (instead of graphite), this could signiﬁcantly
ﬂatten the SED in the submm range (Serra D´ıaz-Cano & Jones
2008; Jones et al. 2013). More exotic explanations have also
been proposed, from magnetic nanograins emitting at the mi-
crowave and submm wavelengths (Draine & Hensley 2012) to
spinning grains (Draine & Lazarian 1998) which emit however
more in the millimeter (mm) range (Bot et al. 2010).

A step forward has been the possibility to carry out spa-
tially resolved analysis of the dust SED with a combination of
Spitzer and Herschel data, which allow to investigate variations
of the dust properties at small scales. The Magellanic Clouds and
M33 are excellent targets to perform such studies. In the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) Galliano et al. (2011) found evidence
for a submm excess in the low surface brightness areas by ﬁt-
ting the dust SED locally with a detailed dust model. Gordon
et al. (2014) were able to ﬁt the SEDs of the LMC and the Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using a MBB with a broken power-law
for β. For M33 Tabatabaei et al. (2014) carried out a MBB ﬁt of
the local SED and found a trend of decreasing temperature T
and decreasing β with radius (this trend is the opposite of what
would be expected from the β-T degeneracy). They concluded
that a change in the dust properties is the most likely reason for
this trend. Other studies have tried to look for variations in the
dust properties in further objects. Galametz et al. (2014) inves-
tigated the 870 µm emission of a sample of 11 nearby galaxies
and found evidence for a submm excess in 4 of them. For three
of these objects the excess was in the outskirts of the galaxy.
Hermelo et al. (2013) decomposed the observed emission of the
dwarf, low metallicity galaxy NGC 4214 into its SF and diﬀuse
components. They modeled these components separately using
radiation transfer models and found indications of submm excess
in the diﬀuse component of NGC 4214.

This paper is part of a series of studies that use radiation
transfer models to ﬁt the SED of a sample of dwarf starburst and
late-type spiral disk galaxies. Here we apply the same methodol-
ogy as in Hermelo et al. (2013) to the local-group galaxy M33.
The proximity of M33 (0.840 Mpc, Freedman et al. 1991), its
moderate inclination angle (57◦, Deul & van der Hulst 1987)
and the wide data set available, make this galaxy an excellent
target to study separately the SEDs of the SF and the diﬀuse
component with accuracy. Recent results of the open time key

2

program HerM33es (Kramer et al. 2010) have shown that the
Herschel observations of M33 can not be well reproduced as-
suming standard dust properties (i.e. MBB model with β=2).
Instead, these authors had to adopt a MBB model with β=1.5 to
obtain a good ﬁt. The value of β=1.5 is extensible to the Planck
data (see Appendix A for details) and suggests that that the dust
properties or conditions might be special in M33.

The aim of the present paper is to investigate if it is possible
to reproduce the SED of M33 with standard dust grain properties
but using more sophisticated models based on radiation transfer
calculations and a realistic geometry, or if the anomalies found
by Kramer et al. (2010) persist. The paper is organized as fol-
lows. In Sect. 2 we present the data set used, from UV to radio.
Sect. 3 is devoted to explain the photometry measurements and
the method we have used to separate the emission coming from
the SF regions and the ISM in the galaxy. In Sect. 4 we explain
brieﬂy the models applied to ﬁt the SED of the two components
and how we determined their input parameters. The results of
the modeling are presented in Sect. 5. In Sect. 6 we discuss the
results and in Sect. 7 we summarize the main conclusions of this
paper.

2. Data
A wide range of data from recent scientiﬁc missions are available
for M33 in archives. In this section we describe the data used in
our study, which are summarized in Tab. 1.

2.1. GALEX

To investigate the continuum UV emission associated with the
young stellar population of M33, we use the data from the
Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX, Martin et al. 2005) dis-
tributed by Gil de Paz et al. (2007). The GALEX far-UV (FUV
∼ 154 nm) and near-UV (NUV ∼ 232 nm) observations and the
data reduction can be found in Thilker et al. (2005). The angu-
lar resolution for the GALEX FUV and NUV maps is 4 .(cid:48)(cid:48)2 and
5 .(cid:48)(cid:48)3, respectively. Following Morrissey et al. (2007), we conser-
vatively adopted a calibration error of 10%.

2.2. Sloan

We used data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, York
et al. 2000) to measure the stellar emission in the u-band and
to calculate the b-band stellar disk scale-length of M33. Due to
the small FoV of the SDSS images, we needed to reconstruct
a mosaic to cover the whole extension of M33 in these bands.
For this purpose, we used the software Montage1. Montage is
a toolkit for creating mosaics from individual Flexible Image
Transport System (FITS) images. We made use of the data from
the seventh data release (DR7, Abazajian et al. 2009). These im-
ages have a spatial coverage of 13.(cid:48)51×9.(cid:48)83, an exposure time of
53.9 s, and the angular resolution is ∼ 1 .(cid:48)(cid:48)4 (median value mea-
sured in the Sloan r-band). The SDSS DR7 pipeline does not
apply any sky subtraction to the raw data. Considering that most
of the frames used to reconstruct the mosaics are fully covered
by light coming from M33, the usage of the DR7 data allows us
to avoid possible artifacts coming from an inaccurate sky sub-
traction. Following Padmanabhan et al. (2008) we adopted 1%
of calibration error for the Sloan g-band and 2% for the Sloan u-
band.

2.3. Hα

To trace the ionized gas, we use the narrow band Hα image of
M33 obtained with the Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO)
by Greenawalt (1998). The reduction process, using standard
IRAF2 procedures to subtract the continuum emission, is de-
scribed in detail in Hoopes & Walterbos (2000). The total ﬁeld of
view (FoV) of the image is 1.75×1.75 deg2 (2048×2048 pixels
with a pixel scale of 2 .(cid:48)(cid:48)03) with a 6 .(cid:48)(cid:48)6 resolution. We consider
typical uncertainties to be better than 15% for the Hα photomet-
ric measurements (Verley et al. 2010b).

2.4. Spitzer

Data of M33 was obtained with the Spitzer (Werner et al.
2004) Infrared Array Camera (IRAC, Fazio et al. 2004) and the
Multiband Imaging Photometer (MIPS, Rieke et al. 2004). We
use IRAC 3.6 µm and 4.5 µm data to study the radiation ﬁeld as-

Observatories, which are operated by the Association of Universities
for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the
National Science Foundation.

sociated with the old stellar population of M33 and MIPS 24 µm
to study the dust emission. The MIPS 70 µm and MIPS 160 µm
data were not used in this work since better quality data from
PACS are available at the same wavelengths. The emission
from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), traced by the
IRAC 5.8 µm and 8.0 µm bands, is out of the scope of the present
work.

IRAC 3.6 µm and 4.5 µm data are described in Verley et al.
(2007, 2009, 2010a). The MIPS 24 µm data have been processed
using the version 18.5 of the MOPEX software (MOsaicker and
Point source EXtractor, Makovoz & Marleau 2005) to combine
the 16 AORs (Astronomical Observation Request) available in
the data archive. The spatial resolution is 2 .(cid:48)(cid:48)5, 2 .(cid:48)(cid:48)9, and 6 .(cid:48)(cid:48)3 for
the IRAC 3.6 µm, IRAC 4.5 µm, and MIPS 24 µm bands, respec-
tively. We adopted calibration errors of 2% and for the IRAC
bands (Reach et al. 2005) and 4% for MIPS 24 µm (Engelbracht
et al. 2007).

2.5. Herschel

As part of the HerM33es key program (Kramer et al. 2010), the
M33 galaxy was mapped by Herschel with the Photodetector

Array Camera and Spectrometer
(PACS, Poglitsch et al.
2010) and the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver
(SPIRE, Griﬃn et al. 2010). PACS 100 µm and 160 µm and
SPIRE 250 µm, 350 µm, and 500 µm observations were done
in parallel mode in two orthogonal directions on January 7th,
2010, covering a region of about 1.36 square degrees. The
PACS 70 µm image was obtained as a follow–up open time cy-
cle 2 programme, on 25 June 2012 in 2 orthogonal directions
and 5 repetitions to achieve better sensitivity (Boquien et al.
2015). The PACS reduction has been performed using the map-
making software Scanamorphos (Roussel 2013) as described in
Boquien et al. (2011). The SPIRE reduction has been done us-
ing the Herschel Data Processing System (HIPE, Ott 2010, 2011)
and the maps were created using a ”naive” mapping projection
(Verley et al. 2010b; Boquien et al. 2010; Xilouris et al. 2012).
The angular resolution of the Herschel data range from 5 .(cid:48)(cid:48)6 at
70 µm to 36 .(cid:48)(cid:48)4 for the 500 µm band. The absolute photometric
uncertainty is 10% for the PACS 70 µm and 100 µm bands and
20% for the PACS 160 µm band (Poglitsch et al. 2010), while
we adopted 5% as the calibration uncertainty for the three SPIRE
bands (Bendo et al. 2013).

2.6. LABOCA

Observations of M33 were carried out at the Atacama Pathﬁnder
Experiment (APEX, G¨usten et al. 2006) using the Large
Bolometer Camera (LABOCA, Siringo et al. 2009) between
2010 and 2012 (Albrecht et al., in prep.). A ﬁlter set coupled
to the atmospheric window provides a bandwidth of ∼ 150 µm
(∼ 60 GHz) around the central frequency of 870 µm (345 GHz).
From observations of Uranus an almost circular beam size of
19 .(cid:48)(cid:48)2± 0 .(cid:48)(cid:48)7 was determined (Siringo et al. 2009). LABOCA
mapping was performed in on-the-ﬂy mode parallel and orthog-
onal to the major axis of M33. Flux calibration was achieved
through observations of planets as well as a set of secondary
calibrators and was found to be accurate within 10% (Siringo
et al. 2009). To enable the usage of the LABOCA data in multi-
wavelength studies the ﬂux calibration methods for LABOCA
and SPIRE were compared to ensure a correct cross-calibration.
On average 2% lower ﬂux densities from the LABOCA calibra-
tion compared to the SPIRE method were found.

The LABOCA data were reduced using the BoA3 software
package. The applied skynoise suppression can not distinguish
between correlated atmospheric noise and astronomical emis-
sion that is uniformly extended over areas equal to or larger than
the area covered by the groups of bolometer channels (deﬁned by
having the same ampliﬁer box or same wiring) that are used to
derive the median noise. This typically ﬁlters out uniform emis-
sion on scales larger than about 2.(cid:48)5 (for details see Schuller et al.
2009). To minimize the eﬀect an iterative approach by subse-
quently improving a model of the ﬂux distribution was applied.
Nevertheless, given the large apparent size of M33, the result-
ing LABOCA map does not recover the entire contribution from
the extended emission, as it is conﬁrmed by comparing with the
corresponding PLANCK 850 µm map (see Fig. 1).

2.7. Planck

We used Planck data from the 2013 distribution of released prod-
ucts (Planck Collaboration et al. 2014a) based on the data ac-
quired during the Planck “nominal” operations period, i.e., be-

3 http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/boawiki/Boa

4

tween 12 August 2009 and 27 November 2010. Data can be ac-
cessed via the Planck Legacy Archive4.

In the case of the Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) 10 mm
(30 GHz) band, we used the ﬂux computed in the Planck Catalog
of Compact Sources (Planck Collaboration et al. 2014c). For the
other Planck bands, i.e., the High Frequency Instrument (HFI)
350 µm (857 GHz), 550 µm (545 GHz), 850 µm (353 GHz),
1.4 mm (217 GHz), 2.1 mm (143 GHz), and 3.0 mm (100 GHz)
bands and the LFI 4.3 mm (70 GHz) and 6.8 mm (44 GHz)
bands, we extracted the ﬂuxes from the Planck all-sky maps.
These maps consist of 2048 HEALPix full-sky maps (G´orski
et al. 2005) corresponding to a pixel size of 2.(cid:48)64 with an angular
resolution that ranges from 4.(cid:48)63 at 350 µm to 32.(cid:48)3 at 10 mm
(Ade et al. 2014). To generate a Gnomonic projection of the
HEALPix data centered on M33 we made use of the IDL fa-
cility Gnomview5. The cosmic microwave background (CMB)
was subtracted from all the bands (see Appendix B for details).
The contribution from other components (e.g., cirrus, cosmic in-
frared background) to the background was subtracted as the me-
dian value in a 5(cid:48) width annulus enclosing M33. The resulting
maps are shown in Fig. 1. M33 was not detected in the 4.3 mm
and 6.8 mm channels. We adopted ±10% of calibration uncer-
tainty for the 350 µm and 550 µm bands and ±3% for all the
other wavelengths (Ade et al. 2014).

2.8. Effelsberg
Tabatabaei et al.
(2007a) studied the emission at 3.6 cm
(8.35 GHz) of M33. Here we used their results to constrain the
thermal radio emission of the SF regions as well as to decontami-
nate our measurements from synchrotron emission (see Sect. 3.3
for details).
They found a total ﬂux of 761 ± 63 mJy for the inner 7.5 kpc
and a thermal fraction of 51.4 ± 4.2% at this wavelength. This
fraction was obtained from the extinction corrected Hα map of
the galaxy, which was derived using a map of optical depth at
160 µm and an extinction law for a standard dust model for the
diﬀuse emission. The authors also derived the thermal fraction
using the classical method and assuming a constant non-thermal
spectral index for the whole galaxy of αn = 1.0 ± 0.1. With this
method they obtained a thermal fraction of 63.2 ± 5.3%.
As a compromise between the two values of the thermal frac-
tion derived by Tabatabaei et al. (2007a), we adopted the mean
value as the best estimate and we allowed it to ﬂuctuate be-
tween the lowest and the highest possible values. We therefore
estimated that 57.3 ± 11.2% (436 ± 49 mJy) of the total ﬂux at
8.35 GHz corresponds to thermal radio emission.

3. Photometry
Prior to performing the photometry, we ﬁrst homogenized all
the images to the same data unit in order to measure all ﬂuxes
in Jy/pixel (with a pixel size of 14(cid:48)(cid:48)). Bright foreground stars
were removed from the UV and optical data. We then convolved
all the data to the resolution of SPIRE 500 µm using the set of
kernels provided by Aniano et al. (2011)6, with the only ex-
ception of Planck data, which have a coarser resolution than
the SPIRE 500 µm image, and therefore, they were only used
to obtain the total photometry of M33. Using the IRAF task

wregister, we then regridded all the images to the pixel size
of the SPIRE 500 µm map. Color corrections were applied to all
the MIR/FIR/submm/mm ﬂuxes (see Appendix A for details) In
this section we describe how we separated the diﬀerent com-
ponents, how we corrected our measurements from undesired
contributions (e.g., CO line emission), and how the errors were
handled.

3.1. Component separation
In order to decompose M33 into its SF and diﬀuse components,
we used the software SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996).
SExtractor explores a given image for knots of emission by
searching groups of connected pixels that exceed some thresh-
old above the background in the surroundings of the region.

We run SExtractor on the Hα image in order to separate
the SF from the diﬀuse component. As the diﬀuse emission
reaches a higher level in the inner part than in the outskirts of
the galaxy, the threshold should be relative and vary to reﬂect
these local variations. The size of the background mesh should
be large enough to avoid a strong contamination from the SF but
small enough to reproduce the local scale variations of the dif-
fuse emission. We ﬁnd that a mesh size of 12 pixels (with a pixel
size of 14(cid:48)(cid:48) this corresponds to 680 pc) yields an adequate sepa-
ration between the detected SF objects and background map ac-
counting for the diﬀuse emission. In practice, the decomposition
between the SF and diﬀuse components can be summarized in
two main steps. Firstly, the diﬀuse emission map is computed by
estimating the background (using a clipping to reject the bright
SF regions) in each cell of a grid that covers the whole image.
Secondly, SF regions are detected above a local threshold equal
to 40 times the background noise map obtained in the previous
step. The result of this separation method is shown in Fig. 2.

We tested diﬀerent local thresholds between 5 and 100 times
the background noise. We found that for values below 20 the SF
regions detected are signiﬁcantly contaminated by diﬀuse emis-
sion. On the other hand, values above 60 produces the rejection
of may of the fainter SF regions. A good compromise that leads
to an optimal separation of the two components was found for
a threshold of 40. We adopted this intermediate value and we
discuss in Appendix C the impact of our choice.

To replicate the same separation in the other bands, we ﬁrst
derive a map of the diﬀuse emission in the same way as done for
the Hα map. We then obtain the diﬀerence between each original
image and its diﬀuse emission map to remove the background/-
foreground diﬀuse emission from the whole map. Subsequently,
we create a mask mirroring the detected SF objects in the Hα
image and applied it to the full set of multiwavelength images to
extract the exact same SF regions in all the bands, without being
contaminated by the diﬀuse emission. We used the Hα image to
create the mask because this is the band that best represents the
wavelength-dependent morphology of the SF regions. Finally,
for each band, the diﬀuse emission map is obtained by subtract-
ing the SF region map to the original map.

Once the SF and diﬀuse component are separated for each
band we determined the ﬂux densities by integrating over the
corresponding maps (see Tab. 2). We used an aperture for the
entire galaxy deﬁned by a radius of 35(cid:48) (8.5 kpc) and an inclina-
tion of 57◦ (see Fig. 1). This aperture is slightly larger than the
one used by Kramer et al. (2010) in order to enclose the whole
emission of the Planck bands, which have a much poorer reso-
lution than the data used by these authors.

In those cases where the angular resolution did not allow
to extract the emission from the SF regions (i.e., Planck data),

8

the diﬀuse emission was estimated by subtracting the ﬂux of the
SF component predicted by the model of Groves et al. (2008)
from the total ﬂux of M33. Even though our estimates of the dif-
fuse emission are well constrained by this method in most wave-
lengths, the lack of data points constraining the SED of the SF
component between LABOCA 870 µm and the free-free emis-
sion at 3.6 cm from Tabatabaei et al. (2007a) introduces some
uncertainties. As a cautionary measure, we do not include the
indirect data points in the ﬁtting procedure.

3.2. CO contamination
transitions CO(1→0)
The emission from the CO rotational
at 2.6 mm (115 GHz), CO(2→1) at 1.3 mm (230 GHz), and
CO(3→2) at 870 µm (345 GHz), fall into the bandpasses of the
Planck 3.0 mm, 1.4 mm, and 850 µm ﬁlters, respectively (Planck
Collaboration et al. 2014b). In addition, the LABOCA 870 µm
ﬁlter is also aﬀected by the CO(3→2) line.

In order to correct the measured continuum ﬂuxes for the
contribution of these major gas cooling lines, we made use
of CO(2→1) observations (Druard et al. 2014) obtained with
the HEterodyne Receiver Array (HERA, Schuster et al. 2004)
mounted on the IRAM 30 m telescope on Pico Veleta (Spain).
Druard et al. (2014) mapped the inner ∼ 7 kpc of M33 with
an angular resolution of 12(cid:48)(cid:48). These authors reported a total
CO(2→1) luminosity of 2.8 × 107 K km s−1 pc2, which corre-
sponds to a ﬂux of 6.5×104 Jy km s−1. For the PLANCK 1.4 mm
ﬁlter, which has a width of 64.5 GHz (87 433 km s−1) and a trans-
mission close to 100% at the frequency of the CO(2→1) line (see
Fig. 1 in Planck Collaboration et al. 2014b), we measured a ﬂux
density of 17.4 Jy. Using these values we estimate that 4.3% of
the ﬂux density of M33 measured with this ﬁlter comes from
CO(2→1) line emission.
The CO(1→0) line emission was also observed with the
IRAM 30 m telescope in a radial cut along the major axis of
M33 (Braine et al. 2010). Comparing these data with their map,
Druard et al. (2014) found a constant ratio ICO(1→0)/ICO(2→1) of
1.25 in the overlapping area. Assuming that this ratio can be ex-
trapolated to the whole disk of M33, we can estimate the ﬂux of
CO(1→0) as:
S CO(1→0) = 1.25 ×

S CO(2→1) = 2.0 × 104 Jy km s−1.

We measured a ﬂux density of 1.56 Jy with the PLANCK 3.0 mm
ﬁlter, which has a width of 32.9 GHz (97 762 km s−1) and a trans-
mission of about 60% at the frequency of the line. Therefore, we
estimate that the CO(1→0) emission is responsible for 7.9% of
the ﬂux measured with the PLANCK 3.0 mm band.

With the PLANCK 850 µm ﬁlter we measured a ﬂux density
of 74.3 Jy. Using a width of 101.4 GHz (85 032 km s−1) and a
transmission ∼ 100%, we found that the contribution from the
CO(3→2) line to the PLANCK 850 µm is ∼ 2.3%. In the case
of the LABOCA 870 µm ﬁlter, we measured a ﬂux density of
37.1 Jy. For a width of 59.8 GHz (52 026 km s−1) and a transmis-
sion ∼ 100%, we found that the contribution from the CO(3→2)
line to this ﬁlter is (∼ 7.6%).

smoothed to the resolution of the SPIRE 500 µm band, the central panel shows the SF regions detected by SExtractor using a
threshold of 40, and the right panel corresponds to the diﬀuse emission. The white contours are included to facilitate the comparison
between panels and they correspond to the boundaries of the SF regions. The emission from the SF component represents 41.7% of
the total Hα emission.

3.3. Synchrotron emission

Unlike the free-free emission coming from the H ii regions, the
modeling applied in this work does not take into account the con-
tribution of the synchrotron emission. For this reason, the ﬂuxes
measured with Planck need to be decontaminated from this
component. Following the analysis of Tabatabaei et al. (2007a)
we extrapolated the synchrotron emission from 3.6 cm to the
Planck ﬁlters assuming a non-thermal spectral index of 0.72 (see
Sect. 2.8). We found non-thermal contributions of 30% and 5%
respectively for the PLANCK 10 mm and 3.0 mm bands, while
for the other bands this contribution was found to be negligible.

3.4. Error of ﬂux measurements

In our error analysis we took two types of error into account:
i) calibration, ∆cal, using the values presented in Tab. 1, and ii)
measurement error due to background ﬂuctuations, ∆back.

The error due to the background ﬂuctuations was calculated
by assuming that each pixel within the aperture has an error
given by the standard deviation of the background noise, σback.
In addition, we have to take the error of the background into ac-
count which was subtracted within an aperture of Napert pixels.
Nback, where Nback is the number of
This error is σbackNapert/
pixels used to compute the level of background. This gives (see
also Dale et al. 2012) a total error for the background subtracted
ﬂux of

The ﬁnal error for the ﬂux is the quadratic sum of ∆cal and ∆back.
In the case of the Planck data, ∆back also includes the error due
to the CMB subtraction.

4. Models for the dust emission

We analyzed the full UV to radio SED of the diﬀerent emis-
sion components of the galaxy using the radiation transfer model
of Popescu et al. (2011), which self-consistently treats the dust
emission from the SF and the diﬀuse components, consider-
ing the illumination of the diﬀuse dust both by the distributed
stellar populations and by the escaping light from the H ii re-
gions. While maintaining consistency within the framework of
the Popescu et al. (2011) model, we used the model of Groves
et al. (2008) to provide a detailed description of the dust emis-
sion from the SF component. The methodology used in this work
is similar to the one applied to the low-metallicity, dwarf galaxy
NGC 4214 in Hermelo et al. (2013). For a detailed description
of the models we refer the reader to Groves et al. (2008) and
Popescu et al. (2011). To make this paper self-contained, in the
following sections we present a brief description of the physics
and parameters of the models.

4.1. The model of Popescu et al. (2011)

Popescu et al. (2011) present a self-consistent model based on
full radiative transfer calculations of the propagation of starlight
in disk galaxies. These authors adopted the dust properties from
Weingartner & Draine (2001) and Draine & Li (2007), incor-
porating a mixture of graphite, silicate, and PAH molecules. To

approximate the large-scale geometry of the galaxy (see Fig. 1
in Popescu et al. 2011), they use two separate components:
– An old component consisting of an old stellar disk, an old

stellar bulge, and a thick disk of dust.

– A young component consisting of a young stellar disk and a

thin disk of dust.
The spectral energy distribution of both old and young stellar
components are shown in Tab. E.2 and in Fig. 8 of Popescu et al.
(2011). These authors only considered the optical-IR radiation
for the old stellar population, and neglected any contribution in
the UV. The spectral distribution covers the wavelengths from
4 430 Å to 50 000 Å. The young stellar population is deﬁned as
an exponentially declining S FR with a time constant of 5 Gyr,
solar metallicity and Salpeter IMF with an upper mas cut-oﬀ of
100 M(cid:12). The spectral distribution covers from 912 Å to 50 000 Å.
Apart from the diﬀuse component, the model includes a
clumpy component, consisting of the parent molecular clouds
of young (≤ 10 Myr) and massive stars. This component will be
modeled here in a diﬀerent way than Popescu et al. (2011) have
done (see Sect. 4.2), as for M33 it is possible to separate the
emission from the SF regions and the diﬀuse dust.

The input parameters of the Popescu et al. (2011) model are:

– The total central face-on B-band opacity, τf
B.
– The star formation rate, S FR.
– The clumpiness factor F, which is linked to the fraction of
photons that escape ( fesc) from the SF regions into the diﬀuse
medium (F=1 − fesc).

– The normalized luminosity of the old stellar disk, old.
– The bulge-to-disk ratio, B/D.
– The radial scale length of the old stellar disk, hs. All other
spatial scales in the galaxy related to the diﬀerent component
in the model have a constant ratio with hs (see Tab. E.1 in
Popescu et al. 2011).

– The inclination angle of the galaxy, i.
From the primary parameters S FR and F, Popescu et al. (2011)
deﬁne the SFR powering the diﬀuse emission, S FR(cid:48), as follows
(Eq. 45 in Popescu et al. 2011):
S FR(cid:48) = S FR × (1 − F).
The library of diﬀuse SEDs of Popescu et al. (2011) contains
results for a four-dimensional parameter space spanned by τf
B,
S FR(cid:48), old, and B/D.
The diﬀuse component is calculated as an extrinsic quantity
corresponding to a reference size (corresponding to a reference

scalelength). To scale the intensity of the radiation ﬁeld heating
the diﬀuse dust, the parameters S FR(cid:48) and old must be scaled
to the reference size by comparing the scalelengths (Eq. D.3 in

library of models. An additional scaling is required to set the

cape fraction, fλ, is tabulated in Tuﬀs et al. (2004, Tab. A.1).
Therefore, by combining Eq. 9 and Eq. 10, it is possible to cal-
culate the radiation ﬁeld associated with the young stellar popu-
s,young). The emission of the old

stars that leaves the galaxy (S ν

but in this case the composite attenuation is ∆mλ=∆mλ
this radiation ﬁeld is only attenuated by the diﬀuse ISM.

It is noteworthy that in the Popescu et al. (2011) model the
old stellar population emits exclusively in the optical-IR wave-
length range (see their Tab. E.2), i.e., the emission corresponds
to the radiation ﬁeld emitted by a remarkably old stellar popu-
lation. Thus, what Popescu et al. (2011) calls ’old’ stellar popu-
lation does not correspond to the deﬁnition of ’old’ stellar pop-
ulation usually found in the literature (see the Fig. 1 panel Scd
of Rowan-Robinson et al. 2008 for an example of a moderate
old stellar population with a SED extending into the optical-UV
range). As a consequence, in the Popescu et al. (2011) model the
old stellar population has little relevance for the dust heating.

4.2. The model of Groves et al. (2008)
In Popescu et al. (2011) the clumpy component corresponding to
the SF regions is modeled with an average template representing
the emission of all SF regions. Although this is a good approach

(8)

p0 = log

(11)

for unresolved galaxies, the high spatial resolution of our data
allowed us to apply a detailed modeling of the SF component.

The Groves et al. (2008) model describes the luminosity evo-
lution of a star cluster of mass Mcl, and incorporates the expan-
sion of the H ii region and PDR due to the mechanical energy
input of stars and supernovae. The dust emission from the H ii
region and the surrounding PDR is calculated from radiation
transfer calculations. The hydrogen column density of the PDR
=1022 cm−2. The Groves et al. (2008)
is ﬁxed to the value NPDR
model assumes a standard mixture of dust consisting of graphite,
silicate, and PAHs, with standard grain properties from Laor &
Draine (1993), Li & Draine (2001), and Weingartner & Draine
(2001). The input parameters of the model are:
– The metallicity of the star cluster, Z, in units of the solar
metallicity Z(cid:12) (Asplund et al. 2005).
– The age of the star cluster, T , in Myr.
– The ambient pressure, expressed as

The C parameter determines the dust grain temperature dis-

et al. (2011). Hereafter the abbreviation fcov will be used to
refer to both parameters.

4.3. Observational constraints on the input parameters
The large amount of ancillary data for M33, as well as the results
of previous studies from the literature, allowed us to constrain
part of the input parameters for both models.

For the model of Popescu et al. (2011) we were able to place

the following constraints:
– Bulge-to-disk ratio: Using deep H-band (1.65 µm) observa-
tions of M33, Minniti et al. (1993) found an excess of emis-
sion in the innermost 2(cid:48) that they identiﬁed with a small
bulge. Regan & Vogel (1994) claimed that if a compact
bulge is present, it does not make a large contribution to the
spheroidal light. More recently, Corbelli & Walterbos (2007)
analyzed gas and stellar radial velocities in the innermost
0.5 kpc of M33. Their study showed that the central part of
the galaxy does not exhibit kinematic signature of a signiﬁ-
cant bulge. Since there is no convincing evidence for a bulge
in M33, here we opted for a bulge-to-disk ratio (B/D) equal
to 0.
– Inclination angle: We assumed an inclination angle of
57◦ based on 21 cm line observations of M33 with the
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (Deul & van der
Hulst 1987).

– B-band scalelength: We obtained the radial stellar scale
length in the B-band, hs, using the Sloan g-band image. The
ﬁt of an exponential function to the surface brightness pro-
ﬁle gives a value of hs=2513 ± 80 pc (see Fig. 3). This value

11

I. Hermelo et al.: Millimeter and Submillimeter Excess Emission in M33 revealed by Planck and LABOCA.

agrees with the scalelength for young star formation tracers
such as FUV, NUV and Hα (Verley et al. 2009).

– Dust scalelength: In the model of Popescu et al. (2011) the
scale of the diﬀerent components are normalised to the B-
band scalelength of the disk, hs. In particular, the Popescu
et al. (2011) model assumes that the scalelength of the thick
disk of dust (hd) is a factor 1.4 larger than hs. To compare
the actual geometry of M33 with the model assumptions
we calculated the scalelength traced by the SPIRE 500 µm
emission. Shorter wavelengths are more aﬀected by the
dust temperature distribution, while Planck data at longer
wavelengths lack the angular resolution necessary to extract
isophotal ﬂuxes. For SPIRE 500 µm we found a scalelength
of 3200 ± 100 pc (see Fig. 4). If we approximate hd with this
value, we obtain hd/hs = 1.27 ± 0.08, close to the value 1.4
assumed in the model.
– old: We derived this parameter as 0.05 by assuming that the
IRAC 3.6 µm and 4.5 µm bands mainly trace the emission
from the old stellar population (Bendo et al. 2015). Then we
integrated the luminosity of M33 under these two bands and
derived old as the ratio of this luminosity and the integrated
luminosity of the model galaxy for the old stellar component
(Popescu et al. 2011, Tab. E2).

plotted against deprojected radius. The background subtracted
Sloan g-band was used to obtain the average value of circu-
lar apertures in the outer parts of M33 disk where previously
foreground stars and H ii regions were masked. The ﬁt (solid
line) was achieved using the isophotes in the radial range
marked by the grey-shaded area. We obtain a ﬁnal scalelength of
2513 ± 80 pc. The horizontal and vertical dashed gray lines indi-
cate the 25 mag/arcsecond2 isophote. The error bars are smaller
than the data points.

In the case of the model of Groves et al. (2008), we estab-

lished the following constraints:
– Metallicity: Magrini et al. (2007) studied the radial oxy-
gen abundance gradient in M33 using a list of 83 H ii re-
gions with [O iii] λ4363 detections. These authors found that
12+log[O/H] ranges from ∼8.5 to 8.1 (see their Fig. 3). For
the solar metallicity presented in Asplund et al. (2005) these
limits corresponds to values of Z(cid:12) from ∼0.7 to 0.3. To cover

deprojected radius. The ﬁt (solid line) was achieved using the
isophotes in the radial range marked by the grey-shaded area.
The error bars are smaller than the data points.

this range we constrained the metallicity to the discrete val-
ues 1.0, 0.4, and 0.2 Z(cid:12) allowed by the Groves et al. (2008)
model.

– Age: A small sample of young stellar clusters was studied by
Grossi et al. (2010) and Fan & de Grijs (2014), ﬁnding that
most of the star clusters have ages of ∼ 3 Myr. A larger sam-
ple was studied by Sharma et al. (2011), who found represen-
tative values about 5 Myr in the inner part of disk (galacto-
centric radii (cid:46) 4 kpc) and about 7 Myr for star clusters within
the outer disk (from 4 to 7 kpc). Therefore, we restricted the
age to the range from 3 to 7 Myr.
– Compactness and ambient pressure: Unfortunately we could
not constrain either C or p0, so we left both parameters free
in the ﬁtting procedure and checked later if they are within
the expected range of values derived from Eq. 12 and the
mass range derived by Sharma et al. (2011) for the star clus-
ters in the inner part of M33 (from 102 M(cid:12) to 105 M(cid:12)).

The remaining parameters were left free in the ﬁtting procedure.

4.4. Fitting procedure

In order to ﬁnd the best-ﬁtting model and its uncertainty for both
the SF and the diﬀuse components we used the following proce-
dure: for each component we generated a total of 100 slightly
diﬀerent data sets by allowing the observed ﬂuxes to randomly
vary following a Gaussian distribution within the error bars. For
each one of these sets we found the best-ﬁtting model using a χ2
minimization technique. To build the best-ﬁtting solution (i.e.
most probable SED and its range of uncertainty) we extracted
the median, the minimum, and the maximum SEDs from the set
of 100 best-ﬁtting models. To express the range of values ob-
tained through the iteration process we will use the nomencla-
ture Xmed ∧ Xmax
∨ Xmin to report median (Xmed), maximum (Xmax),
and minimum (Xmin) values.

5. Results

5.1. Best ﬁt for the SF component

The best-ﬁtting solution for the SF component was obtained by
exploring the parameter space of the model of Groves et al.
(2008) with the constraints presented in Tab. 3 (see Sect. 4.3 for
details). For each one of the 100 iterations, a total of 6885 diﬀer-
ent parameter combinations were tested to ﬁnd the minimum χ2.
Note that Planck data could not be used to ﬁt the SF component
due to their lack of angular resolution. The best ﬁtting model is
shown in Fig. 5, and the range of values found for the parameters
is presented in Tab. 3. The reduced χ2 is 4.69 ∧ 12.15
∨ 0.73 . We found
that the metallicity of the best-ﬁtting solution is 0.2 ∧ 0.4∨ 0.2, at the
low end of the values reported by Magrini et al. (2007).
The best-ﬁtting solution gives a total mass of the stellar
clusters of 1.6 ∧ 1.9∨ 0.9×106 M(cid:12). Taking into account the number of
SF regions detected we can estimate an average value of about
5×103 M(cid:12) for the individual stellar clusters, well centered within
the limits estimated by Sharma et al. (2011). The dust luminos-
∨ 0.36×109 L(cid:12). As Fig. 5
ity associated to the SF regions is 0.42 ∧ 0.49
shows, the model of Groves et al. (2008) is not able to repro-
duce the LABOCA 870 µm observations (see Tab. 4 for details).
A complete discussion of this excess is given in Sect. 6.

5.2. Best ﬁt for the diffuse component

We searched the library of the diﬀuse dust SEDs of Popescu et al.
(2011) for the best-ﬁtting solution to the data in the MIR/submm
B and S FR(cid:48) as free parameters and keeping ﬁxed
range, leaving τf
old to 0.05 and B/D to 0.0 (see Tab. 3 for details). For each one
of the 100 iterations we tested a total of 784 diﬀerent combina-
B and S FR(cid:48). The ﬂux level was scaled using Eq. 8 and
tions of τf
hs=2513 pc. As we mentioned in Sect. 3, Planck data were not
used in the ﬁtting procedure since their diﬀuse ﬂuxes were not
directly measured but inferred, while LABOCA 870 µm band
was not used due to the observational limitations discussed
in Sect. 2.6. The S 36 mm data point was neither used since
the thermal radio continuum is not related to the diﬀuse ISM
but to the ionized gas within the SF component. The results
are shown in Fig. 6 and Tab. 4. The reduced χ2 is 1.82 ∧ 4.44
∨ 0.46
and the dust luminosity associated to the diﬀuse component is
1.30 ∧ 1.50

∨ 1.08×109 L(cid:12).
The model of Popescu et al. (2011) systematically under-
predicts the submm and mm estimated ﬂuxes from Planck (see
Tab. 4 for details). This excess of emission is discussed in
Sect. 6.

5.3. Total emission

Once we separately ﬁtted the emission from the SF and the dif-
fuse component, we combined both SEDs to match the global
MIR to radio emission of the galaxy, which is shown in Fig. 7.
At MIR/FIR wavelengths the observations are reasonably well
ﬁtted, while at submm and mm wavelengths the excess of emis-
sion found in the individual components translates into a sig-
niﬁcant excess in the global SED of M33 (Fig. 7), showing up
at submm wavelengths and reaching compelling values at mm
wavelengths (see Tab. 4). It is important to note that no traces
of the excess are visible at the PLANCK 10 mm point extracted
from the Planck Catalog of Compact Sources (see Sect. 2.7).

5.4. Energetic balance
The comparison between the predicted radiation ﬁeld escaping
M33 (see Sect. 4.1 for details) and the observations is shown
in Fig. 8. The attenuation and its uncertainty were calculated us-
ing τf
∨ 0.36 as explained in Sect. 4.1. The
B
good agreement in the infrared part comes from the fact that the
s,old to the obser-
parameter old was scaled by hand to match S ν
vations (see Sect. 4.3). On the other hand, in the UV-optical part
we found that the integrated luminosity calculated from the ob-
servations is 70 ∧ 84∨ 59% higher than the expected luminosity. This
discrepancy is discussed in Sect. 6.

5.5. Gas-to-dust ratio
In the model of Groves et al. (2008), the mass of dust contained
in the SF regions depends on the combination of parameters and
it scales with Mcl. For the SF component of M33 we obtained:
MSF
dust

= 2.9 ∧ 3.5∨ 2.5×106 M(cid:12).

(14)

The total mass of diﬀuse dust of M33 can be calculated from the
Eq. 44 of Popescu et al. (2011):

XCO= N(H2)/ICO(1→0) =4 × 1020 cm−2/(K km s−1), including he-
lium. Gratier et al. (2010) used Very Large Array (VLA) observa-
tions of the atomic gas and derived a total mass of 1.4×109 M(cid:12)
within a 8.5 kpc radius. From all these values we can derive a
gas-to-dust ratio of:

Gdust =

Matom + Mmol
MSF
+ Mdiﬀ

=

1.7×109 M(cid:12)
∨ 12.5×106 M(cid:12)

16.7 ∧ 21.0

= 101 ∧ 135∨ 80 ,

(16)

at the low end of the range determined by Kramer et al. (2010),
who found, using MBB models, that Gdust ranges from 200 to
120 depending on the value of β.

Given the solar value Gdust=137 (Draine et al. 2007, Tab. 2),
and assuming that the gas-to-dust mass ratio scales linearly with
metallicity (i.e., the fraction of metals incorporated in the dust
is constant), due to the sub-solar metallicity of M33 we would
expect a higher value of Gdust between 200 and 450 (see Sect. 4.3
for details). Possible origins for this discrepancy are discussed in
Sect. 6. ’

6.1. Cold dust component

A population of very cold dust (VCD) with temperatures below
(10 K) has been proposed to explain the excess of emission at
submm wavelengths (e.g. Galliano et al. 2003, 2005; Galametz
et al. 2009, 2010). Although in general the VCD component is
able to ﬁt well the submm excess, this hypotheses is considered
unlikely because the large mass of dust required and the strong
shielding from the ambient radiation ﬁeld necessary to keep the
grains at such low temperatures (Lisenfeld et al. 2002). In this
line, Galliano et al. (2011) found that the submm excess in the
LMC can not be produced by a cold dust component.

To explore the VCD hypothesis in the case of M33 we added
to its total SED a MBB component with β=2 (see top panel of
Fig. 9). We found that the submm and mm excess can be well
ﬁtted using a temperature of ∼ 6 K. The mass of dust required to
produce such emission is:

MVCD ∼ 40×106 M(cid:12),

(17)

6. Discussion

Our study has revealed three compelling discrepancies between
the models and the observations: excess of emission at submm
and mm wavelengths (Fig. 7), deﬁcit of absorption of UV pho-
tons (Fig. 8), and abnormally low value of Gdust (Sect. 5.5). In
the following, we discuss in detail diﬀerent hypothesis that could
explain these discrepancies.

which is about three times higher than the combined mass of
dust found in the SF and the diﬀuse components. Adding this
extra mass of dust would imply an unreasonably low value of
Gdust(cid:46)50. For reference, note that Baes et al. (2014) found a
value Gdust<14.5 for the extreme case of NGC 5485, an early
type galaxy with no atomic or molecular gas detected but with a
prominent dust lane perpendicular to the photometric major axis.

the model expectations, while δobs and δmod corresponds to the relative error of the observations and the models, respectively.

6.2. Spinning grains

Draine & Lazarian (1998) proposed that electric dipole radiation
from spinning grains are responsible for the anomalous emis-
sion of the diﬀuse Galactic background peaking near 10 mm. In
the Draine & Lazarian (1998) model the very small grains are
disk-like shaped while large grains are spherical, and both rotate
around their axis of major inertia, which produces that the fre-
quency of photons emitted is identical to the angular frequency.
According to these authors, the rotational excitation of the spin-
ning grains is dominated by collisions with ions and plasma drag
and the rotation rate depends on several factors such as the inten-
sity of the radiation ﬁeld and the physical parameters of the gas
phase. For example, while the peak of the emission from spin-
ning grains ranges from ∼7 to 15 mm in the cold neutral, warm
neutral and warm ionized medium, it can reach values below
2 mm in PDRs (see Hoang et al. 2010 for a reﬁned version of the
model of Draine & Lazarian 1998).

To study the possibility of spinning dust grains as respon-
sible for the excess of emission detected in M33 we included
their contribution in the total SED. As the mid panel of Fig. 9
shows, the excess of emission at wavelengths (cid:46) 2 mm can not
be reproduced even if we assume spinning grains rotating at the
highest rate allowed by Hoang et al. (2010). Moreover, the con-
tribution from spinning grains degrade the good agreement pre-

viously found between models and observations at wavelengths
around 10 mm.

6.3. Magnetic nanoparticles

Draine & Hensley (2013) claimed that if part of the interstel-
lar Fe forms ferro- or ferri-magnetic grains, then the magnetic
dipole radiation from these grains might contribute signiﬁcantly
to the total dust SED. These authors considered three materi-
als as potential candidates: metallic Fe, magnetite (Fe3O4), and
maghemite (γ-Fe2O3). Draine & Hensley (2012) show how mag-
netic grains are able to explain the strong excess of submm and
mm emission found in the SMC.

In order to test if magnetic nanoparticles can explain the ex-
cess of emission found in M33 we ﬁtted the SED expected for
10 nm metallic Fe grains at 18 K (see right panel in Fig. 8 of
Draine & Hensley 2013) by adjusting the intensity until the best
ﬁt to the FIR-mm data points was achieved, as it is shown in the
bottom panel of Fig. 9. The contribution from magnetic grains
can alleviate the mm and submm excess but is not able to satis-
factory ﬁt the data in this wavelength range. In addition, the ﬁt
at the PLANCK 10 mm. We also tested the possibility of 100 nm
metallic Fe grains at 18 K. The ﬁt is worse than for the 10 nm
grains in the submm/mm/PLANCK 10 mm range. In addition,
they have a strong impact on the peak of the SED thus degrading

the ﬁt at wavelengths ∼ 150 µm. Thus, for M33, in contrast to
the SMC, magnetic grain emission is not an entirely satisfactory
explanation for the mm and submm excess.

6.4. CO-to-H2 conversion factor
The low value of Gdust obtained here depends in part on the
mass of molecular gas obtained by Druard et al. (2014), who
determined a conversion factor XCO=4 × 1020 cm−2/(K km s−1)
for M33, about twice higher than the Galactic value which
is reasonable for the ∼ 2 times lower metallicity. A value of
XCO(cid:38)20 × 1020 cm−2/(K km s−1) would provide enough molec-
ular gas to achieve a Gdust in the expected range of Gdust(cid:38)200.
However, this is a unreasonably high value for the case of M33,
where combining CO, H i, and IR measurements, Leroy et al.
(2011) did not ﬁnd evidence of such deviations in the value of
XCO.

6.5. Porosity

A porous ISM would allow a higher fraction of the UV radia-
tion to escape the galaxy without interacting with the dust thus
alleviating the UV discrepancy. Several theoretical studies try
to explain how the internal properties of galaxies aﬀect the es-
cape fraction. Among the properties that can inﬂuence the es-
cape fraction are: the covering factor of the clumps in the ISM,
as well as the density of the clumped and inter clump medium

tion) combined with an extra component (purple line-dashed) to

tom panel).

nova (SN) remnants that provide the photons with a clear path to
escape the galaxy (Dove & Shull 1994), and the porosity of the

to the expansion of SN-driven bubbles. Therefore, the UV dis-

crepancy derived from our modeling might be due to large shell
structures across the whole galactic disk (Rela˜no et al. 2013).

6.6. Dust heated by evolved stars

Could an unrealistic SED of the stellar populations that are heat-
ing the dust be responsible for the mm and submm excess and/or
the UV discrepancy? Popescu et al. (2011) discussed in detail
the inﬂuence of the spectral shape of the stellar radiation on the
dust SED (see their Sect. 4.3). They concluded that the stellar
SED does not aﬀect signiﬁcantly the shape of the dust SED and
that the most relevant parameters shaping the dust SED are the
overall stellar luminosities as well as the geometry and the prop-
erties of the dust. Therefore, the exact shape of the stellar SED
is unlikely to be a very important source of error in our study.

In order to quantify in M33 the contribution to the dust heat-
ing by the evolved stellar population, we set S FR to 0 and
checked the amplitude of the diﬀuse SED keeping the remain-
ing values the same as in our best-ﬁtting solution. We found that
this contribution is indeed negligible with the exception of the
wavelengths around the peak, where it contributes slightly to the
dust emission. It is noteworthy that this result is at ﬁrst sight
in contradiction with the results of Boquien et al. (2011), who
found a tight correlation between the 250/350 µm ratio and the
3.6 µm luminosity (L3.6 µm) at scales of 42(cid:48)(cid:48) (∼ 170 pc) that they
interpret as an indication of the old stars being the main heating
source of the dust emitting in the 250−350 µm wavelength range.
This apparent discrepancy between our study and Boquien et al.
(2011) is not real but it comes from diﬀerent deﬁnitions of what
is considered “old” stellar population (see our Sect. 4.1 for de-
tails).

6.7. Geometry

The discrepancies revealed by our study might be explained by
diﬀerences between the actual geometry of M33 and the geom-
etry assumed by the model of Popescu et al. (2011, Tab. E.1).
As we mentioned in Sect. 4.3, there is no evidence of any dis-
crepancy regarding the radial dimensions of the disk of dust.
Regarding the vertical dimensions, for a B-band scalelength of
2513 pc, the model of Popescu et al. (2011) predicts scaleheights
of 186 pc for the old stellar disk, 121 pc for the thick disk of dust,
and 40 pc for both the young stellar disk and the thin disk of dust.
Using the break of the power-spectrum in diﬀerent emission
bands, Combes et al. (2012) were able to give an estimation of
the thickness of the stellar and dust disks of M33: cold dust lies
in a 350 pc disk, warm dust lies in a 100 pc disk, and the thick-
ness of the stellar disk in the FUV and NUV bands was found to
be 40 pc and 56 pc, respectively. Unfortunately, the conversion
of the breaks found by Combes et al. (2012) to scaleheights is
not straightforward since it depends on the conditions in the disk
as the simulations of Combes et al. (2012, Tab. 4) have shown.
Therefore, we can not exclude that the discrepancies found in
our study are due to diﬀerences between the vertical dimensions
of M33 and the model assumptions.

6.8. Different dust properties

Diﬀerences between the actual dust properties of the low metal-
licity galaxy M33 and those adopted in the models (Laor &
Draine 1993; Li & Draine 2001; Weingartner & Draine 2001;
Draine & Li 2007) might explain simultaneously the three dis-
crepancies found. Recently Jones et al. (2013) proposed that

18

interstellar dust in the diﬀuse ISM might be characterized by
a lower emissivity index β at long wavelengths. If this is the
case, these dust grains would provide ﬂatter emission at submm
and mm wavelengths, which would result in a better agree-
ment between our modeling and the observations. Additionally,
a lower emissivity index resulting in a higher extinction coef-
ﬁcient would allow a lower dust surface density to account for
the dust emission, which would result in a decrement of the UV
absorption, and thus a lower UV excess, and a lower dust mass,
thus increasing the value of Gdust.

7. Summary and conclusions
We have modeled separately the emission coming from the SF
regions and from the diﬀuse ISM in the spiral galaxy M33, us-
ing radiation transfer models based on dust grains with stan-
dard properties. Thanks to the wide set of data available for this
galaxy, as well as the numerous previous studies from other au-
thors, we could constrain an important part of the parameters
used by the models.

For the SF component, we found that the model of Groves
et al. (2008) is able to reproduce the MIR-FIR observations and
the thermal radio continuum. However, we found that the model
underestimates the LABOCA data and it is barely compatible
with the SPIRE 500 µm data. Regarding the diﬀuse component,
we found that the model of Popescu et al. (2011) ﬁts well the
MIR/FIR data points but underpredicts severely the observa-
tions longwards 800 µm. We also found that our modeling un-
derpredicts by 70 ∧ 84∨ 59% the UV radiation that escapes the galaxy
without interacting with the dust. We derived a gas-to-dust ra-
tio Gdust=101 ∧ 135∨ 80 , signiﬁcantly lower than the expected value
based on the sub-solar metallicity of M33.
We discussed various processes that could explain these dis-
crepancies. A cold dust component emitting in the submm and
mm is unlikely due to the large mass of dust that would be
needed. Spinning grains and the magnetic nanoparticles can not
reproduce well the submm and mm excess and they seriously de-
grade the ﬁt at other wavelengths. Previous studies of the molec-
ular gas in M33 discards the possibility of anomalies in the XCO
conversion factor that could explain the low value of Gdust. Since
in the model of Popescu et al. (2011) the exact shape of the stel-
lar radiation ﬁeld has little inﬂuence in the dust emission, dust
heating from evolved stars is unlikely to be a source of error.
Diﬀerences in the geometry assumed by the model and the ac-
tual geometry of M33 could explain the discrepancies but there
is no observational evidence for such diﬀerences. A porous ISM
could explain to the excess escape of UV radiation.

As a ﬁnal option, we discussed diﬀerent physical properties
of the dust grains. A lower β would ﬂatten the dust emission
at submm and mm wavelengths, decrease the UV attenuation,
and bring the gas-to-dust ratio closer to the expected value, thus
explaining simultaneously the three discrepancies.

Appendix A: MBB ﬁt and color corrections
As pointed out in Sect. 1, MBB models are one of the simplest
and widely used techniques to ﬁt the dust SED. Kramer et al.
(2010) found that a MBB with β=1.5 can reproduce the dust
SED of M33 up to of 500 µm, the longest wavelength available
in their study. Here we conﬁrm that the value β=1.5 found by
these authors is still valid up to wavelengths of 3 mm as revealed
by Planck data (see Fig. A.1).

a multipole (cid:96)=4000 (see Appendix D in Planck Collaboration
et al. 2014e, for details).

Ade et al. (2014) used the SMICA map to subtract the CMB
from M31, as from a visual inspection this appears to be the
cleanest map of the CMB in that region from the four methods.
Following these authors, we also made use of the SMICA map to
remove the CMB in the line of sight of M33. The Gnomonic pro-
jection of the SMICA map was generated using the same method
explained in Sect. 2.7.

Fig. A.1: Characterization of the SED of M33 using MBB and
power-law spectra. The residuals shown in the bottom panel cor-
respond to the MBB ﬁt. The gray shaded area of ±30% is in-
cluded to facilitate the reading.

As we mentioned in Sect. 3, our photometric measurements
were color corrected. Color corrections are necessary to com-
pare monochromatic ﬂuxes with the models of Popescu et al.
(2011) and Groves et al. (2008). In order to select appropriate
SED proﬁles in the immediacy of each data point, we mimicked
the observations of M33 using MBB models and power-laws,
S ν ∝ ν α.
We found that the observations of M33 can be well repro-
duced with both a two-component modiﬁed black body of β=1.5
and T =20 K and T =57 K or a combination of four power-laws
with indices ranging from -2.3 to 3.0 (see Fig. A.1 for details).
Then we searched in the tables for MIPS7, PACS8, SPIRE9, and
Planck (Planck Collaboration et al. 2014d) for the listed color
corrections that best correspond to the proﬁles found. For ex-
ample, for MIPS 24 µm we used the value 0.960 tabulated for a
power-law of index -2.0 (no values are listed for -2.3). For the re-
maining PACS, and SPIRE bands we found lower corrections. In
the case of Planck data, color corrections are higher, with values
ranging from 0.963 at 143 GHz to 0.854 at 545 GHz.

Appendix B: CMB subtraction
The angular size of the ﬂuctuations of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) in the line of sight of M33 is comparable to
the size of the galaxy itself (see Fig. B.1). For this reason, the
contribution of the CMB to the ﬂux of M33 must be removed in
a pixel-by-pixel basis instead of of simply assuming an homoge-
neous background.

Four diﬀerent CMB maps obtained with diﬀerent component
separation techniques are available in the Planck Legacy Archive
(see Tab. 1 in Planck Collaboration et al. 2014e). The Spectral
Matching Independent Component Analysis method (SMICA),
reconstructs the CMB map as a linear combination of all the
nine Planck frequency channels harmonically transformed up to

Appendix C: Alternative thresholds
In addition to the threshold of 40 times the background noise
used in this paper to separate the SF and the diﬀuse components
(see Sect. 3.1 for details), we also examined the results we ob-
tain when adopting thresholds of 20 (see Fig. C.1) and 60 (see
Fig. C.2). As Tab. C.1 and Tab. C.2 show, the results derived
from our modeling does not depend signiﬁcantly on the value of
the threshold used, i.e., independently of the threshold we found
i) similar deviations between the models and the observations,
ii) similar dust masses, and iii) similar fractions of UV radiation
escaping M33. The main reason is that the emission from the SF
component constitutes only a small fraction of the total SED for
most wavelengths (100 µm (cid:46) λ (cid:46) 1 mm).
