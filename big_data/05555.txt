ABSTRACT

We present results from X-ray observations of the gravitationally lensed z = 1.51 AGN HS 0810+2554
performed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and XMM-Newton. Blueshifted absorption lines are
detected in both observations at rest-frame energies ranging between ∼1–12 keV at >
∼ 99% conﬁdence.
The inferred velocities of the outﬂowing components range between ∼0.1c and ∼0.4c.

A strong emission line at ∼6.8 keV accompanied by a signiﬁcant absorption line at ∼7.8 keV is also
detected in the Chandra observation. The presence of these lines is a characteristic feature of a P-Cygni
proﬁle supporting the presence of an expanding outﬂowing highly ionized iron absorber in this quasar.
Modeling of the P-Cygni proﬁle constrains the covering factor of the wind to be >
∼ 0.6, assuming disk
shielding. A disk-reﬂection component is detected in the XMM-Newton observation accompanied by
blueshifted absorption lines. The XMM-Newton observation constrains the inclination angle to be
< 45◦ at 90% conﬁdence, assuming the hard excess is due to blurred reﬂection from the accretion
disk.

The detection of an ultrafast and wide-angle wind in an AGN with intrinsic narrow absorption lines
(NALs) would suggest that quasar winds may couple eﬃciently with the intergalactic medium and
provide signiﬁcant feedback if ubiquitous in all NAL and BAL quasars.

We estimate the mass-outﬂow rate of the absorbers to lie in the range of 1.5 and 3.4 M⊙ yr−1
for the two observations. We ﬁnd the fraction of kinetic to electromagnetic luminosity released by
HS 0810+2554 is large (ǫk = 9+8
−6) suggesting that magnetic driving is likely a signiﬁcant contributor
to the acceleration of this outﬂow.

1. INTRODUCTION

Our X-ray survey of Narrow Absorption Line (NAL;
∼ 500 km s−1) AGN with outﬂows (Chartas et
FWHM <
al., 2009a) has revealed a remarkable X-ray bright grav-
itationally lensed object: HS 0810+2554.
It was de-
tected in a 5 ks Chandra observation with a 2–10 keV
observed ﬂux of 8×10−13 erg s−1 cm−2 and its spec-
trum shows hints of blueshifted high energy broad ab-
sorption lines (BALs) implying the presence of a mas-
sive and ultrafast X-ray absorbing wind (Chartas et al.
2014). The VLT/UVES spectrum of HS 0810+2554
shows blueshifted C iv and N v doublets that are likely
intrinsic to the quasar outﬂow based on a partial cov-
ering analysis (see Chartas et al. 2014 and references
therein). The observed wavelengths of the C iv doublet
(λλ 1548.20 ˚A, 1550.77 ˚A) imply that the UV absorber

is outﬂowing with a speed of vCIV ∼ 19,400 km s−1.
The only other quasar detected to date with similar
blueshifted X-ray absorption features and a narrow ab-
sorption line (NAL) outﬂow is the unlensed z=2.74 NAL
quasar HS 1700+6414 (Lanzuisi et al. 2012) which, how-
ever, has a ∼10 times lower 2–10 keV ﬂux of 3–9×10−14
erg s−1 cm−2.

Blueshifted X-ray broad absorption lines have been de-
tected in several high-z quasars (i.e., APM 08279+5255,
Chartas et al. 2002; PG 1115+080, Chartas et al. 2003;
and HS 1700+6416, Lanzuisi et al. 2012). Our spec-
tral analysis of the 5 ks Chandra observation revealed a
possible near-relativistic outﬂow of X-ray absorbing ma-
terial also in HS 0810+2554 (Chartas et al. 2014). Be-
cause of the low signal-to-noise ratio of the 5 ks Chandra
observation only the combined spectrum of all images
was analyzed. The main result from that analysis was
the detection of absorption lines at rest-frame energies
of ∼7.7 keV and ∼10 keV at the 97% signiﬁcance level
implying the presence of two outﬂowing components at
velocities of ∼0.13c and ∼0.41c respectively.

We recently re-observed HS 0810+2554 for ∼98 ks with
Chandra and for ∼46.4 ks with XMM-Newton. The goals
of the follow-up observations of HS 0810+2554 were to:
(a) conﬁrm the ultrafast outﬂow of HS 0810+2554 at
diﬀerent epochs and in individual images, (b) constrain
the properties of the outﬂowing material in the higher
S/N observations, (c) study the variability of the X-ray
outﬂow, and, (d) determine the contribution of a galaxy
group to the lensing of HS 0810+2554. In this paper we
present results from these observations of HS 0810+2554

and address the science goals that we set out to meet.

In §2 we present the spectral and spatial analysis of
HS 0810+2554 and a nearby galaxy group that con-
tributes to the lensing, in §3 we discuss the properties
of the outﬂow and show how our estimated values of
the mass-outﬂow rate, wind eﬃciency and covering factor
imply that the quasar wind in HS 0810+2554 provides
signiﬁcant feedback through a massive, energetic, and
wide-angle outﬂow, and in §4 we present a summary of
our conclusions. Throughout this paper we adopt a ﬂat
Λ cosmology with H0 = 67 km s−1 Mpc−1, ΩΛ = 0.69,
and ΩM = 0.31, based on the Planck 2015 results (Planck
Collaboration et al. 2015).

2. X-RAY OBSERVATION AND DATA ANALYSIS
HS 0810+2554 was observed with the Advanced CCD
Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS; Garmire et al. 2003) on
board the Chandra X-ray Observatory (hereafter Chan-
dra) on 2002 January 30 and 2013 December 16 with
eﬀective exposure times of 4,894 sec and 97,730 sec, re-
spectively. HS 0810+2554 was also observed with XMM-
Newton (Jansen et al. 2001) on October 4, 2014 with an
eﬀective exposure of 46,400 sec. The analysis of the 2002
observation was presented in Chartas et al. 2014. Here
we describe the analysis of the 2013 and 2014 observa-
tions of HS 0810+2554.

For the reduction of the Chandra observations we used
the CIAO 4.6 software with CALDB version 4.5.9 pro-
vided by the Chandra X-ray Center (CXC). We used
standard CXC threads to screen the data for status,
grade, and time intervals of acceptable aspect solution
and background levels. To improve the spatial resolution
we employed the sub-pixel resolution technique devel-
oped by Li et al. (2004) and incorporated via the Energy-
Dependent Subpixel Event Repositioning (EDSER) algo-
rithm into the tool acis process events of CIAO 4.5. The
pointing of the telescope placed HS 0810+2554 on the
back-illuminated S3 chip of ACIS.

For the reduction of the XMM-Newton observations we
ﬁltered the pn (Str¨uder et al. 2001) and MOS (Turner
et al. 2001) data by selecting events corresponding to
instrument PATTERNS in the 0–4 (single and double pixel
events) and 0–12 (up to quadruple pixel events) ranges,
respectively. Several moderate-amplitude background
ﬂares were present during the last ∼7 ks of the XMM-
Newton observation of HS 0810+2554. The pn and MOS
data were ﬁltered to exclude times when the full-ﬁeld-of-
view count rates exceeded 30 cnts s−1 and 4 cnts s−1,
respectively.

To test the sensitivity of our results to background
ﬂares we also extracted pn and MOS spectra with more
conservative values of the full-ﬁeld-of-view count rates
of 20 cnts s−1 and 3 cnts s−1, respectively. To test for
sensitivity to background non-uniformity we also tried
diﬀerent background extraction regions. We did not ﬁnd
any diﬀerences in the spectral shapes and features using
the more conservative threshold cuts or selecting diﬀerent
background extraction regions.

The pn and MOS spectra were ﬁted with a variety
of models employing XSPEC version 12 (Arnaud 1996).
The energy ranges used for ﬁtting the pn and MOS data
were 0.3–11 keV and 0.4–10 keV, respectively. We per-
formed spectral ﬁts to the pn spectra alone and to the pn
and MOS data simultaneously. Both approaches resulted

in values for the ﬁtted parameters that were consistent
within the errors, however, the ﬁts to the higher quality
pn data alone yielded lower reduced χ2 values compared
to the combined ﬁts. We therefore consider the results
from the ﬁts to the pn data alone more reliable especially
for characterizing the properties of the X-ray absorption
features.

The Chandra spectra of the individual

images of
HS 0810+2554 were also ﬁtted with a variety of
models employing XSPEC. For all spectral models of
HS 0810+2554 we included Galactic absorption due to
neutral gas (Dickey & Lockman 1990) with a column
density of NH= 3.94 × 1020 cm−2.

2.1. Spatial Analysis of HS 0810+2554

We perform a spatial analysis of the Chandra observa-
tion of HS 0810+2554 by ﬁtting the lensed images (see
Figure 1) simultaneously using the relative astrometry
derived from HST images and MARX models (Wise et al.
1997) of the PSF. The details of this analysis are similar
to the procedure described in Chartas et al. 2014. Table
1 lists the observation date, the observational identiﬁ-
cation number, the exposure time, and the number of
counts (in the 0.2–10 keV band) of each image corrected
for PSF eﬀects. For comparison we also include the re-
sults from the 2002 observation of HS 0810+2554. The
total 0.2-10 keV count-rate has decreased by a factor of
∼ 2.5 between the 2003 and 2013 epochs. XMM-Newton
does not resolve the lensed images of HS 0810+2554 and
in Table 1 we list the total background-subtracted EPIC-
pn counts from all images.

Figure 1 shows a binned image and the best-
ﬁt PSF model of the 2013 Chandra observation of
HS 0810+2554.
In Figure 2 we show the deconvolved
image. For the deconvolution we applied the Richardson-
Lucy algorithm (Richardson 1972; Lucy 1974) and sup-
plied a point spread function (PSF) created by the sim-
ulation tool MARX (Wise et al. 1997). Images A and B
are not resolved, while image C is resolved in the decon-
volution. Image D is likely too faint to be reconstructed
in the deconvolution.

The multi-wavelength ﬂux ratios of HS 0810+2554 are
presented in Table 2. Image C is signiﬁcantly brighter
in the X-ray band in the 2013 epoch compared to the
2002 epoch and its X-ray ﬂux ratio diﬀers signiﬁcantly
from the optical. Images C and D are easily resolved by
Chandra and HST and their ﬂux ratios are less aﬀected
by any possible systematic eﬀects due to PSF modeling.
One possible explanation of this ﬂux anomaly of image C
is strong magniﬁcation due to microlensing of this image
during the 2013 observation. Microlensing will in general
distort the X-ray spectrum of the aﬀected image. We
therefore ﬁt the Chandra spectra of images (A+B) and
C separately (see §2.2.1).

2.2. Spectral Reduction Procedures of HS 0810+2554
For the spectral analysis of the Chandra observations
we extracted spectra for the combined images A+B and
for the spatially resolved image C. Image D was too faint
to extract a spectrum. The extracted regions are shown
in Figure 1. The background were determined by extract-
ing events within an annulus centered on the mean loca-
tion of the images with inner and outer radii of 10 arcsec

The Wide-Angle Outﬂow of AGN HS 0810+2554

3

and 50 arcsec, respectively. The extracted Chandra spec-
tra were grouped to obtain a minimum of 20 counts in
each energy bin, above the minimum required number of
counts per bin for χ2 to be statistically valid (e.g., Cash
1979; Bevington & Robinson 2003).

For the spectral analysis of the XMM-Newton obser-
vation we extracted spectra for the combined images
A+B+C+D. The extracted spectra from the pn and
MOS were grouped to obtain a minimum of 40 counts
in each energy bin, allowing use of χ2 statistics. We
tested the sensitivity of our results to the grouping fac-
tor by performing the analysis with the grouping ranging
between 20 counts per bin and 100 counts per bin. The
best-ﬁt parameters were found to be similar in all cases.
We selected a grouping of 40 counts per bin because
this provided tight constraints on the ﬁtted parameters
with the bin size being comparable to or smaller than
the energy resolution of the instrument in regions of the
spectrum where we expect to ﬁnd narrow absorption or
emission lines. Background spectra for the pn and MOS
detectors were extracted from source-free regions near
HS 0810+2554.

We performed ﬁts to the spectra of HS 0810+2554
with a variety of models of increasing complexity. The
ﬁt residuals show signiﬁcant absorption and/or emission
at observed-frame energies of 1–8 keV. To illustrate the
presence of these features we ﬁt the Chandra spectra of
combined images A+B and resolved image C (see Fig-
ure 3) and the XMM-Newton spectra of combined im-
ages A+B+C+D (see Figure 4) in the observed-frame
0.35–10 keV band with a power-law model (modiﬁed by
Galactic absorption) and plot the best-ﬁt model and the
ﬁt residuals.

We proceed in ﬁtting the following models to the data
(see Tables 3, 4, and 5) guided by the shape and location
of identiﬁed absorption and/or emission residuals:
1) power-law modiﬁed by neutral intrinsic absorption
at the source. This and all subsequent models in-
clude Galactic absorption due to neutral gas (Dickey &
Lockman 1990) with a column density of NH= 3.94 ×
1020 cm−2.
2) power-law modiﬁed by neutral intrinsic absorption and
a number of absorption and/or emission lines. The Chan-
dra spectra of images (A+B) and C diﬀer signiﬁcantly
due to microlensing (see § 2.2.1). Guided by the residual
features to ﬁts using model 1 (see Figure 1) the Chan-
dra spectrum of image A+B was next ﬁtted with a model
that included three absorption lines and one emission line
and the Chandra spectrum of image C was ﬁtted with a
model that included three emission lines. The Chandra
spectrum of image (A+B) and the XMM-Newton spec-
trum of (A+B+C+D) diﬀer signiﬁcantly due to the fact
that XMM-Newton does not resolve the images and due
to possible spectral variability between the observations.
Guided by the residual features to the ﬁts using model 1
(see Figure 4) the XMM-Newton spectrum was next ﬁt-
ted with a model that included two absorption lines and
neutral Compton reﬂection with self-consistent Fe and
Ni lines (PEXMON). In model 2 the absorption lines are
ﬁt with Gaussians. In the next model the Gaussian ab-
sorption lines are replaced with a more realistic model of
outﬂowing intrinsic ionized absorption.
3) power-law modiﬁed by neutral intrinsic absorption,

outﬂowing intrinsic ionized absorption and a number
of emission lines. Speciﬁcally, the Chandra spectrum
of image A+B was ﬁtted with a model that included
one outﬂowing ionized absorber and one emission line,
the Chandra spectrum of image C was ﬁtted with a
model that included one outﬂowing ionized absorber and
three emission lines, and the XMM-Newton spectrum
was ﬁtted with a model that included two outﬂowing
ionized absorbers and neutral Compton reﬂection with
self-consistent Fe and Ni lines (PEXMON).
4) power-law modiﬁed by neutral intrinsic absorption,
an outﬂowing ionized absorber, and scattering by the
outﬂowing wind. This model was ﬁtted to the Chandra
spectrum of image A+B.
5) power-law modiﬁed by neutral intrinsic absorption, a
narrow emission line near the Fe Kα line, an outﬂowing
ionized absorber, and scattering by the outﬂowing wind.
This model was ﬁtted to the Chandra spectrum of image
A+B.
6) power-law modiﬁed by neutral intrinsic absorption, an
outﬂowing ionized absorber, scattering by the outﬂowing
wind, and neutral Compton reﬂection from distant parts
of the accretion disk.This model was ﬁtted to the XMM-
Newton spectrum of HS 0810+2554.
7) power-law modiﬁed by neutral intrinsic absorption,
an outﬂowing ionized absorber, scattering by the out-
ﬂowing wind, and retativistically blurred X-ray reﬂec-
tion from parts of the accretion disk near the black hole.
This model was ﬁtted to the XMM-Newton spectrum of
HS 0810+2554.

Models 4 and 5 are only used to ﬁt the Chandra spec-
trum of image A+B that shows a noticeable P-Cygni
proﬁle. Models 6 and 7 are only used to ﬁt the XMM-
Newton spectrum that shows a noticeable hard-X-ray ex-
cess above 15 keV in the rest-frame.

For the outﬂowing ionized absorber with no scattering
we used the XSTAR photoionization model warmabs and
for an outﬂowing ionized absorber with scattering oﬀ the
outﬂowing absorber we used the XSTAR model windabs
(Kallman et al. 1996; Kallman & Bautista 2001). For
improved accuracy and ﬂexibility we have selected to use
the analytic XSTAR versions of the warmabs and windabs
models instead of the XSTAR table models.

We model the velocity broadening of the absorption
lines by introducing in the XSTAR models large turbulent
velocities. We performed several ﬁts where we allowed
the turbulence velocity to vary and found the best-ﬁt val-
ues. Because of the low to moderate S/N of the Chandra
and XMM-Newton spectra of HS 0810+2554, the turbu-
lent velocities, are not well constrained. For the error
analysis of the remaining variables in spectral ﬁts that
used the XSTAR model we therefore froze the turbulent
velocities and list these values in Tables 3, 4, and 5.

For the Compton reﬂection we used the PEXMON model
(Nandra et al. 2007) that incorporates neutral Comp-
ton reﬂection with self-consistent Fe and Ni lines. For
the relativistically blurred X-ray reﬂection we used the
RELXILL model (Garcia et al. 2014). The results from
ﬁtting these models to the Chandra and XMM-Newton
spectra of HS 0810+2554 are presented in Tables 3, 4,
and 5.

2.2.1. Spectral Analysis of Chandra Observation of

HS 0810+2554

4

CHARTAS ET AL.

We begin with a description of the ﬁts to the Chan-
dra spectrum of image (A+B) of HS 0810+2554. The
intrinsic neutral absorption in image A+B is found to be
relatively low with NH = 0.39+0.15
−0.13 × 1022 cm−2 (model 3
of Table 3). In Figure 5 we show the 68%, 90% and 99%
χ2 conﬁdence contours of the intrinsic hydrogen column
density, NH versus the photon index. We consider our
constraints on the intrinsic NH from the ﬁts to the Chan-
dra spectrum of A+B more reliable than the ﬁts to the
spectrum of image C since image C is likely microlensed
based on the X-ray ﬂux ratios.

−0.1 keV, 7.8+0.5

−0.5 keV, and 13.1+1.6

The Chandra spectra of images A+B and C diﬀer sig-
niﬁcantly and thus were ﬁtted separately. A broad emis-
sion line at 6.8+0.2
−0.2 keV is detected in the spectrum of
image A+B and signiﬁcant absorption lines at energies
at 2.2+0.1
−1.5 keV (all ener-
gies expressed in the rest-frame). The inclusion of three
Gaussian absorption lines near the absorption features
and one Gaussian emission line in model 2 of Table 3
resulted in a signiﬁcant improvement of the ﬁt compared
to the ﬁt using model 1 (∆χ2 = 29.8 ∆dof = 12, where
dof are the degrees of freedom). χ2 conﬁdence contours
of the normalizations of the absorption lines versus their
rest frame energies based on ﬁts using model 2 of Ta-
ble 3 are presented in Figure 6. The absorption line at
7.8 keV is detected at > 99% conﬁdence while the lines at
2.2 keV and 13.1 keV are marginally detected at > 95%
conﬁdence. The energy of the emission line at ∼ 6.8
keV is consistent with Fe XXV and/or Fe XXVI. The
presence of this emission line at ∼ at 6.8 keV and an
absorption line at ∼ 7.8 keV is a characteristic feature
of a P-Cygni proﬁle supporting the presence of an ex-
panding outﬂowing highly ionized absorber from quasar
HS 0810+2554. χ2 conﬁdence contours of the normaliza-
tions of the emission and absorption line of the P-Cygni
proﬁle are presented in Figure 7. The P-Cygni lines are
detected at > 99% conﬁdence. The ratio of the normal-
izations of the emission to absorption lines of the P-Cygni
proﬁle of image A+B is RP = Nemis/Nabs ∼ 0.75. We
note that the ratio measured for the wide-angle outﬂow
of the nearby quasar PDS 456 over ﬁve diﬀerent epochs
lies in the range of RP = 0.19 –1.67 with an average value
of hRPi ∼ 0.7 (Nardini et al. 2015).

We propose as a possible explanation for the diﬀer-
ence between the spectrum of fainter image C and the
combined spectrum of images A+B a microlensing event
occurring in image C. This interpretation is consistent
with the anomalous X-ray ﬂux ratio of image C (see Ta-
ble 4). Microlensing may lead to energy shifts of the
iron emission lines due to general and relativistic eﬀects
as found in the lensed quasar RX J1131−1231(Chartas
et al. 2016). The energies of the best-ﬁt emission lines
of image C are presented in Table 3. We note that the
emission lines in image C are only detected at the ∼ 90%
conﬁdence level. We ﬁt the Chandra spectrum of (A+B)
with a model that includes an outﬂowing photoionized
absorber and one emission line (model 3 of Table 3).
This model can account for the absorption features at
around 2.2 keV and 7.8 keV as originating from highly
ionized Si and Fe absorbers, respectively.

To model the P-Cygni proﬁle (emission and absorp-
tions lines at ∼ 6.8 keV and ∼ 7.8 keV, respectively) we
used the XSTAR model windabs (model 4 of Table 4). The

ﬁt with model 4 is acceptable in a statistical sense, how-
ever, a residual emission feature remains near the energy
of the Fe Kα line. To account for this emission feature
we add a narrow Gaussian line (model 5 of Table 4). A
narrow Fe line component is typically detected in the
spectra of AGN along with the relativistically blurred
Fe Ka line. The narrow Fe line component is thought
to originate in distant, cold matter such as a molecu-
lar torus or an optical broad line region (e.g. Krolik et
al. 1994; Yaqoob & Padmanabhan 2004; Zhou & Wang
2005). Another plausible process that could produce the
residual emission feature near 6.4 keV is scattering from
a low velocity component of the wind.

In Figure 8 we show the Chandra spectrum of A+B
overplotted with the best-ﬁt model (model 5 of Table
4). Figure 8 also shows the unfolded best-ﬁt model that
includes the P-Cygni proﬁle, a characteristic spectral sig-
nature of an outﬂowing wind. We consider model 5 of
Table 4 as our most realistic model that provides a statis-
tically acceptable ﬁt to the Chandra spectrum of image
(A+B) of HS 0810+2554. We base any following esti-
mates of the outﬂow properties for this epoch on the
best-ﬁt values of model 5 of Table 4. The χ2 conﬁdence
contours of the covering factor of the wind based on mod-
els 4 and 5 of Table 4 are shown in Figure 9. The best-ﬁt
values of the covering factor are fc = 0.57+0.18
−0.18 (68% con-
ﬁdence) assuming model 4 and fc = 0.6+0.2
−0.3 (68% conﬁ-
dence) for model 5.

Model 5 of Table 4 can account for the absorption
features at around 2.2 keV and 7.8 keV as originating
from highly ionized Si and Fe absorbers, respectively,
outﬂowing with a common velocity of 0.1+0.01
−0.01c. The
outﬂow is highly ionized with an ionization parameter 9
of log(ξ/erg cm s−1) = 3.15+0.13
−0.21 and a column density
of NH,out = 2.9+1.6
−0.4 × 1023 cm−2.

2.2.2. Spectral Analysis of XMM-Newton Observation of

HS 0810+2554

We next proceed in the analysis of the XMM-Newton
spectrum of images A+B+C+D of HS 0810+2554. Our
ﬁt to the XMM-Newton spectrum with a simple power-
law with Galactic absorption shows residual absorption
features and a hard excess above ∼ 15 keV in the
rest-frame. We ﬁt the spectrum of XMM-Newton of
HS 0810+2554 with models 1−3 with the best-ﬁt pa-
rameters listed in Table 3. Signiﬁcant absorption lines
are detected at energies of 7.9+0.2
−0.6 keV
(all energies expressed in the rest-frame). The inclusion
of two Gaussian absorption lines near the absorption fea-
tures in model 2 of Table 3 and neutral Compton reﬂec-
tion with self-consistent Fe and Ni lines resulted in a sig-
niﬁcant improvement of the ﬁt compared to the ﬁt using
model 1 (∆χ2 = 44.5, ∆dof = 9). χ2 conﬁdence contours
of the normalizations of the absorption lines versus their
rest frame energies based on ﬁts using model 2 of Table
3 are presented in Figure 10. We continue by ﬁtting the
XMM-Newton spectrum of HS 0810+2554 with a model

that includes two outﬂowing photoionized absorbers and
reﬂection (model 3 of Table 3).

We next

included scattering from the outﬂow
(windabs) to account for a possible weak emission fea-
ture near rest-frame ∼ 7.5 keV (model 6 of Table 5).
We ﬁnally considered a model (model 7 of Table 5) that
describes the hard excess as relativistically blurred X-
ray reﬂection in place of the neutral Compton reﬂection
considered in model 6. The ﬁt with model 7 implies
the presence of two outﬂowing components with ion-
ization parameters of log(ξ/erg cm s−1) = 3.3+0.3
−0.1 and
log(ξ/erg cm s−1) = 3.2+0.2

spectively. In Figure 11 we show that the ﬁt using model
7 of Table 5 constrains the inclination angle of the accre-
tion disk to be less than 45◦ (90% conﬁdence).

−0.01c and 0.41+0.07

The main diﬀerence between models 6 and 7 is that
model 6 assumes distant reﬂection whereas model 7 as-
sumes a relativistic, hence nearby reﬂector. Fits to the
XMM-Newton spectrum of HS 0810+2554 using models
6 and 7 are acceptable with similar (within the uncertain-
ties) best-ﬁt parameters for the properties of the outﬂow-
ing absorbers, the reﬂection fraction and the inclination
angle of the disk (model 7 provides tighter constraints
on the inclination angle). We therefore consider mod-
els 6 and 7 of Table 5 as our most realistic models that
provide statistically acceptable ﬁts to the XMM-Newton
spectrum of image (A+B+C+D) of HS 0810+2554. We
base any following estimates of the outﬂow properties
for this epoch on the best-ﬁt values of model 7 of Table
5, however, we note that the results are similar had we
chosen to use the best-ﬁt results from model 6.

We note that the spectral ﬁt to XMM-Newton spec-
trum requires two ionized absorbers and the ﬁt to the
Chandra spectrum only one. As indicated in Figure 6,
the absorption line at ∼ 13 keV is only marginally de-
tected in the Chandra spectrum and no useful constraints
can be obtained by including a second ionized absorber to
model this line in the Chandra spectrum. XMM-Newton
is more eﬃcient than Chandra at higher energies, which
may explain why the second high-energy absorption line
is detected at a higher conﬁdence level in the XMM-
Newton spectrum.

2.3. A Group of Galaxies Near HS 0810+2554

In Figure 12 we show the 100 ks Chandra image of
HS 0810+2554 and a nearby group of galaxies that con-
tributes to the lensing of this quasar. The image was
binned with a bin size of 0.1 arcsec and adaptively
smoothed with the CSMOOTH tool developed by Ebel-
ing et al. (2000).The 100 ks Chandra observation com-
pared to the previous 5 ks one provides better constraints
of the mass proﬁle and the temperature of this galaxy
group.These mass estimates were used to evaluate the
convergence parameter κ(x),

κ(x) =

Σ(x)
Σcr

where Σ(x) is the surface mass density of the galaxy
group as a function of the cylindrical radius x (e.g.,
Chartas et al.
1998) and Σcr is the critical surface

mass density (see, e.g., Schneider, Ehlers & Falco 1992).
The distortion to the source produced by convergence
is isotropic. An external perturber will also produce
a distortion referred to as shear (γ) that stretches the
intrinsic shape of the source in a preferred direction.
The shear from the galaxy group can be expressed as
2)3/2 where, βrd = rc/dc, rc is the galaxy
γ =
group core radius and dc is the distance from the group
center to the center of HS 0810+2554 (see, Kochanek,
1991).

κ
(1+βrd

The spatial and spectral analysis of the galaxy group
follows steps similar to those presented in Chartas et al.
(2014). Our revised ﬁt to the X-ray brightness proﬁle of
the galaxy group using a β model indicates best-ﬁt values
for its ellipticity of ǫ = 0.08±0.04, β = 0.38 ± 0.01,
and for the core radius of the group of r0 = 0′′.24+0.05
−0.05
(0.37 kpc). We extract the Chandra and XMM-Newton
spectra of the galaxy group from a 50 arcsec radius circle
centered on the X-ray group center. The spectra were
jointly ﬁt with a model consisting of emission from hot
diﬀuse gas based on the XSPEC model mekal (Mewe, et
al. 1985; Kaastra 1992; Liedahl, et al. 1995) modiﬁed
by Galactic absorption. We obtain best-ﬁt values for
the redshift, temperature and metal abundances of z =
0.082+0.007
−0.11 solar,
respectively (all errors are at the 90% conﬁdence level).
The Chandra and XMM-Newton spectra of the galaxy
group overplotted with our best-ﬁt model are shown in
Figure 13. The convergence and external shear due to
the group at the lens position based on our analysis of
the 100 ks Chandra observation are found to be κ ≃ γ =
0.026 ± 0.003.

2.4. Extended Radio Emission Near HS 0810+2554
VLA observations of the gravitationally lensed quasars
HS 0810+2554, RX J0911+0511, HE 0435−1223 and
SDSS J0924+0219 have revealed radio emission in these
radio-quiet objects (Jackson et al. 2015). Of particular
interest is the VLA image of HS 0810+2554 that shows
a faint arc around images A and B likely formed by ex-
tended emission near the quasar and lensed by the inter-
vening galaxy. Jackson et al. model this arc and infer
an extended radio source size of about 10 mas that cor-
responds to a physical size of about 90 pc. This is close
to the predicted size of the inner portion of the narrow
line region (NLR) for an AGN with the luminosity of
HS 0810+2554.

To test whether the ultrafast outﬂow is energetic
enough to produce the observed radio emission of
HS 0810+2554 we compare the unlensed radio luminosity
of HS 0810+2554 at 1.4 GHz with the kinetic luminosity
of the wind. We ﬁnd the luminosity at 1.4 GHz to be
νLν ∼ 1 × 1039 erg s−1 and the kinetic luminosity of the
outﬂow to lie in the range 5–30 × 1046 erg s−1. If the
radio synchrotron emission of HS 0810+2554 is produced
during the acceleration of particles of the AGN outﬂow
as it collides with the surrounding medium we ﬁnd that
the eﬃciency of conversion is signiﬁcantly less than that
of supernova-driven winds.

Zakamska et al. 2015 ﬁnd from the analysis of a sam-
ple of obscured radio-quiet quasars that their radio lu-
minosities are correlated with the velocity of outﬂowing
narrow-line gas. They suggest that the weak radio emis-

6

CHARTAS ET AL.

sion of radio-quiet quasars may be produced by particles
accelerated in the shocks within the quasar-driven out-
ﬂows. Comparing with Figure 10 of Zakamska et al.,
that plots the radio luminosities of a sample of radio-
quiet AGN versus the velocity width of the [O III] emis-
sion, we ﬁnd that the radio luminosity of HS 0810+2554
falls on the borderline between the radio luminosities of
Seyfert galaxies and radio-quiet quasars.

3. DISCUSSION

The 100 ks Chandra and 46 ks XMM-Newton obser-
vations of the NAL quasar HS 0810+2554 conﬁrm the
presence of a highly ionized and relativistic outﬂow in
this quasar and provide tight constraints on the proper-
ties of the wind. These improved constraints allow more
accurate estimates of the mass outﬂow rate and the rate
of kinetic energy injection than the ones provided with
the previous 5 ks Chandra observation.

Our analysis of the P-Cygni proﬁle detected in the
Chandra spectrum of image (A+B) constrains the cov-
ering factor of the wind to be fc= 0.6+0.2
−0.3. As we dis-
cuss later on in this section this value is likely a lower
limit and it is subject to a few caveats. This large cov-
ering factor is consistent with studies of NAL quasars
(e.g., Misawa et al. 2007; Simon et al. 2012; Culliton
et al. 2012) that indicate the true fraction of quasars
with a quasar-driven outﬂow responsible for producing
NALs to be >
∼ 40%. We are assuming that the UV
and X-ray observations are sampling diﬀerent parts of
the outﬂow with the X-ray absorbers located closer to
the continuum source, thus having a higher ionization
level than the UV absorbers that are likely located fur-
ther out. The detection of a Si xiv resonance absorption
line in HS 0810+2554 blueshifted by the same amount
as that of the Fe xxv resonance absorption line support
the presence of a relativistic outﬂow (see Figures 6 and
8).

In Table 6 we list the 0.2–2 keV and 2–10 keV
ﬂuxes and luminosities from the combined images of
HS 0810+2554 since the images are not resolved with
XMM-Newton. We ﬁnd signiﬁcant ﬂux variability.
Speciﬁcally, the 0.2−2 keV ﬂux increased from 4.0+0.3
−0.4
× 10−13 erg s−1 cm−2 to 6.4+0.3
−0.3 × 10−13 erg s−1 cm−2
between the December 2013 and October 2014 observa-
tions. The increase in the 0.2–2 keV ﬂux is accompa-
nied by a signiﬁcant decrease of the intrinsic neutral col-
umn density (see Table 3 and Figure 5). Despite this
signiﬁcant change of the neutral intrinsic column den-
sity the velocity of the outﬂow does not appear to have
changed.We conclude that the soft X-ray ﬂux variability
is possibly caused by a change in the intrinsic neutral
column density.

For estimating the mass outﬂow rate of the wind we
assume a spherically symmetric wind with a covering fac-
tor of fc,i (e.g., Lamers & Cassinelli 1999, implemented
in XSPEC as the windabs model, whose assumptions we
describe below). We approximate NH ∼ n(r)∆r, where
n(r) is the number density of the gas. We use the fol-
lowing expressions to estimate the mass-outﬂow rate and
the eﬃciency of outﬂow:

˙Mi = 4πri(ri/∆ri)NH,impvwind,ifc,i

ǫk,i =

where ∆ri is the thickness of the absorber at radius ri,
NH,i is the hydrogen column density, vwind,i is the outﬂow
velocity of the X-ray absorber, fc,i is the global covering
factor of the absorber, i indicates the absorbing compo-
nent and LBol is the bolometric photon luminosity of the
quasar.

Estimates of the properties of absorbing outﬂows in
HS 0810+2554 for components detected at > 99% con-
ﬁdence are presented in Table 7. We base our outﬂow
estimates for the Chandra and XMM-Newton epochs on
the best-ﬁt results of model 5 (Table 4) and model 7
(Table 5), respectively.

The outﬂow velocities in the Chandra and XMM-
Newton observations of HS 0810+2554 are similar if
one considers the estimated error bars. Speciﬁcally, the
two outﬂow components detected in the Chandra ob-
servation have vabs,1 = 0.10+0.01
−0.01c and vabs,2=0.50+0.14
−0.08c
(component 2 is only marginally detected in model
2) and the two outﬂow components detected in the
XMM-Newton observation have vabs,1 = 0.12+0.02
−0.01c and
vabs,2=0.41+0.07
−0.04c. The signiﬁcance of the detections of
the absorption lines in the Chandra and XMM-Newton
observations are shown in the conﬁdence contour plots
of ﬁgures 6 and 10, respectively.

HS 0810+2554 we correct
the lensing magni-
ﬁcation and apply a bolometric correction to the
2–10 keV luminosities based on the empirical relations
presented in Lusso et al. 2012. The lensing magniﬁ-
cation was determined by modeling the gravitational
lens system HS 0810+2554 using the gravitational lens
adaptive-mesh ﬁtting code glaﬁc version 1.1.6 (Oguri
2010). The lens was modelled as a singular isothermal
ellipsoid plus an external shear from the nearby galaxy
group. We incorporate the more accurate values of κ
and γ obtained from the 100 ks observation in our lens
model to better constrain the image magniﬁcations, the
unlensed luminosity of HS 0810+2554 and the image
time-delays. We ﬁnd that the magniﬁcations of the
images are µA∼42, µB∼43, µC∼11, and µD∼7. The
time-delays between images are found to be tdBA=86 s,
tdBC=6,740 s, tdAC=6,653 s, and tdDC=25,833 s. The
mean Eddington ratio for an AGN with the black hole
mass and redshift of HS 0810+2554 is λEdd ∼ 0.1.
Lusso et al. 2012 indicate that the 2–10 keV bolometric
correction for type I AGN with an Eddington ratio of
λEdd ∼ 0.1 is κ2−10keV ∼ 30. The bolometric luminosity
of HS 0810+2554 during the 100 ks Chandra observation
is LBol=1.1(85/µA+B)(κ2−10keV/30) × 1045erg s−1,
where the lensing magniﬁcation of image (A+B) is µAB
= 85 and the bolometric correction is κ2−10keV=30 for
an unlensed 2-10 keV luminosity of 3.73 × 1043erg s−1.

from the monochromatic luminosities of HS 0810+2554
at 1450˚A and 5100˚A based on the empirical equations
of Runnoe et al.
(2011) list the
continuum monochromatic luminosities log(λL/erg s−1)
of HS 0810+2554 at 1450˚A and 5100˚A to be 44.44 and
44.84, respectively. Using the recommended bolometric
corrections of Runnoe et al. we estimate the bolometric
luminosities based on the 1450˚A and 5100˚A continuum
monochromatic luminosities of HS 0810+2554 to be 1.1
× 1045erg s−1 and 3.7 × 1045erg s−1, respectively. For
the purpose of estimating the eﬃciency of the outﬂow
we adopt a mean value for the bolometric luminosity of
LBol = 1.8 ± 1.3 × 1045erg s−1, based on the X-ray, UV,
and optical bolometric corrections. We assumed a global
covering factor of the outﬂowing absorber of fc=0.6+0.2
−0.3
based on our ﬁts to the P-Cygni proﬁle detected in the
Chandra spectrum of HS 0810+2554.

For estimating the mass outﬂow rate and outﬂow ef-
ﬁciency, we assumed a fraction r/∆r ranging from 1 to
10 based on theoretical models of quasar outﬂows (e.g.,
Proga et al. 2000). Assuming that the maximum outﬂow
velocity is produced by gas that has reached its terminal
velocity one obtains the approximation Rlaunch ∼ a few
times Rs(c/vwind)2 , where vwind is the observed outﬂow
velocity, Rlaunch is the launch radius of the outﬂow, and
Rs = 2GM/c2. Based on our estimated maximum out-
ﬂow velocity (v ∼ 0.4c), we expect r to be similar to
Rlaunch and range between 3 Rs and 20 Rs. Our assumed
range of r is conservative, ranging from the innermost
stable circular orbit (ISCO) radius to 20 Rs. Launching
a wind at signiﬁcantly smaller radii than the ISCO radius
is unlikely since general relativistic (GR) eﬀects on an ab-
sorber launched within the ISCO radius would result in
signiﬁcant redshifts of the absorption lines and launching
radii greater than 20 Rs will result in even larger values
of the mass-outﬂow rate assuming the mass-outﬂow rate
is given by the expression presented in Equation 1. We
note, however, that in Equation 1 we approximate NH ∼
n(r)∆r, assume a continuous wind smoothly distributed
over the disk, and do not consider velocity gradients of
the wind or include special relativistic corrections (see
Equation 4 of Saez & Chartas, 2011).

We used a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the er-
˙Mi and ǫk. The values of vwind and NHabs were
rors of
assumed to have normal distributions within their error
limits. The values of fc, r/∆r, and r were assumed to
have uniform distributions within their error limits. By
multiplying these distributions and with the appropriate
constants from equations 2 and 3 we obtained the distri-
˙Mi and ǫk. We ﬁnally determined the mean
butions of
˙Mi and ǫk and estimated
values of the distributions of
the 68% conﬁdence ranges.

In Table 7 we list the total hydrogen column densities
NH of the X-ray absorption lines, the outﬂow velocity
of each absorption component, the mass-outﬂow rates
and the eﬃciency of the outﬂows. The large fraction of
kinetic to electromagnetic luminosity implies that radia-
tion driving alone cannot explain the acceleration of this
highly-ionized absorber. Magnetic driving likely provides
a signiﬁcant contribution to the acceleration of the X-ray
wind (e.g., Kazanas et al. 2012; Fukumura et al. 2014).
The mass outﬂow rate of HS 0810+2554 is found to lie
in the range 1.5-3.4 M⊙ yr−1 which is comparable to

the accretion rate of HS 0810+2554 which we estimate
to be 1.8 × 10−3(L44/η)M⊙ yr−1 ∼ 1 M⊙ yr−1, where
we assumed a typical accretion eﬃciency of η = 0.1. For
calculating the mass-outﬂow rate we have assumed a con-
tinuous biconical outﬂow with a covering factor. Another
possibility is that the wind is not continuous but made
up of clouds. We note that Equation 1 is approximately
valid in the case of clouds too, as long as the clouds
are distributed throughout the shell of thickness ∆r. Fu-
ture observations with the X-ray satellite Hitomi with its
high energy resolution may be able to show whether the
blueshifted broad X-ray absorption features are caused
by a velocity gradient in a continuous wind. The conﬁr-
mation of smooth broad absorption lines would suggest
that the outﬂow is made of a continuous stream of ionized
material instead of an outﬂow of dense clouds.

The XMM-Newton spectrum of HS 0810+2554 shows
evidence of absorption and reﬂection (see Figure 4).
Model 6 assumes a distant reﬂector and two outﬂowing
absorbers, whereas, model 7 includes a nearby reﬂector
and two outﬂowing absorbers. In both cases the reﬂec-
tion component lies below the direct component except
for the rest-frame energy range of 15−50 keV. If we deﬁne
the reﬂection fraction, R, as the ratio of the ﬂux reﬂected
by the disk to the ﬂux of the direct power-law compo-
nent in the rest-frame energy band of 20−40 keV, we
ﬁnd that R = 1.4 ± 0.6 (for model 7 of Table 5). If light-
bending of the direct component is not important then
the direct component should in general be larger than
the reﬂected one. However, several recent observations
and simulations indicate that the reﬂection component
can dominate in some AGN and the relative strength of
the reﬂected versus direct X-ray emission increases with
the spin of the black hole. In particular, recent studies
of AGN have attempted to disentangle the direct from
the reﬂected X-ray emission (e.g., Fabian 2014; Zoghbi
et al. 2015; Gallo et al. 2015; Keck et al. 2015). To com-
plicate the analysis further the reﬂected X-ray emission
of AGN is thought to be comprised of two main compo-
nents; (a) backscattering from distant cold material in
a dusty molecular torus or in the broad line region gas
and (b) backscattering from ionized disk material near
the black hole. The reﬂected emission from the inner
disk is expected to be blurred due to relativistic eﬀects.
The reﬂection fraction in some cases is found to be larger
than 1 (e.g, Zoghbi et al. 2015; Gallo et al. 2015; Keck
et al. 2015). Reﬂection dominated X-ray spectra can be
caused by light-bending of a portion of the direct emis-
sion component form the hot corona into the black hole
resulting in an increase in the reﬂection fraction. Dauser
et al. 2014 show through simulations that reﬂection frac-
tions in excess of 2 are only possible for rapidly spinning
black holes.

There are additional eﬀects that may distort the X-
ray emission from the corona such as scattering oﬀ an
outﬂowing wind and absorption by material near the
black hole (e.g., Sim et al. 2012; Miller et al. 2009).
The spectral contribution from scattering oﬀ outﬂow-
ing X-ray absorbers has been simulated in Sim et al.
2012.
In their simulations (see ﬁgures 6 and 7 of Sim
et al. 2012) the scattering oﬀ the wind aﬀects mostly
the spectral region near the Fe Kα line (6.4−7 keV) but
does not produce an excess at higher rest-frame energies
(10−100 keV) similar to that produced by backscatter-

8

CHARTAS ET AL.

ing from the optically thick accretion disk. The Sim et
al. simulations also indicate the contribution from scat-
tering to be inclination-angle dependent. Speciﬁcally, the
spectral distortion caused by scattering oﬀ the wind near
the iron line region decreases with decreasing inclina-
tion angle. We therefore conclude that the hard excess
observed above rest-frame energies of ∼12 keV in the
XMM-Newton spectrum of HS 0810+2554 is not the re-
sult of scattering oﬀ the outﬂowing X-ray absorber but
likely the result of backscattering from the accretion disk.
There are several assumptions that are made in the
windabs model that we used to ﬁt the P-Cygni proﬁle of
the spectrum of image A+B. windabs assumes a spher-
ical and isotropic outﬂow ionized by a compact central
continuum source and with a covering factor fc. In the
case of HS 0810+2554 the central ionizing source of the
outﬂowing X-ray absorbing material is the hot corona.
Microlensing studies of radio-quiet quasars with black-
hole masses ranging between ∼107 M⊙ and ∼109 M⊙
indicate that their hot coronae are compact with sizes
close to 6 rg (Chartas et al. 2016). We therefore con-
sider as a reasonable assumption that the ultrafast wind
of HS 0810+2554 is being illuminated by a compact cen-
tral continuum source. The kinetic and geometric struc-
ture of ultrafast winds in radio-quiet quasars in not well
known. A departure of the outﬂow from isotropy will
in general distort the shape of the reﬂected component
(emission line) of the P-Cygni proﬁle. windabs does not
account for the presence of the accretion disk which may
shield a signiﬁcant portion of the reﬂected resonant emis-
sion from the wind. Dorodnitsyn 2009 has simulated the
eﬀect of shielding of an outﬂow by the AGN accretion
disk and ﬁnds that for small inclination angles shield-
ing results in signiﬁcant attenuation of the red wing of
the emission line of the P-Cygni proﬁle (see Figure 12 of
Dorodnitsyn 2009). This suggests that the value of the
covering factor obtained in our analysis using windabs is
likely an underestimate and thus provides a lower limit
of the true covering factor. We reproduced this eﬀect
by simulating a spectrum with a P-Cygni proﬁle with an
emission line of twice the observed strength (unblocked
case) and ﬁtted the spectrum using the windabs model.
The covering factor in this case increased by a factor
of 2. We conclude that the covering factor of the wind
>
∼ 0.6. Future
in HS 0810+2554 is likely large with fc
observations with the high-energy resolution calorimeter
onboard the X-ray satellite Hitomi should be able to re-
solve the structure of the P-Cygni proﬁle and provide
constraints on disk shielding and the presence of general
relativistic eﬀects on the absorption proﬁle.

The

ﬁts

to

the XMM-Newton

spectrum of
HS 0810+2554 using models 6 and 7 that include
a P-Cygni proﬁle do not place any useful constraints
on the opening angle of the wind.
Scattering from
the outﬂowing X-ray absorber is expected to produce
an emission line near the energy of the Fe Kα line
but it is not detected at a high signiﬁcance level
in
the XMM-Newton spectrum as it is in the Chandra
spectrum of image (A+B). This could in part be caused
by the fact that the XMM-Newton spectrum combines
all images and the P-Cygni proﬁle may be smeared if
the spectra of images A+B and C diﬀered during the
observation. Another possible reason is variability of the
covering fraction. There are hints of such variability of

the covering fraction in the ultrafast outﬂow of PDS 456
(see Figure 1 and Table S2 in Nardini et al. 2015).

We have not investigated more complex spectral mod-
els that include multiple reﬂectors and scatterers due to
the relatively low S/N of the available X-ray spectra of
HS 0810+2554 and the lack of spectral coverage in a
higher energy range where the Compton reﬂection com-
ponent is expected to peak. A scheduled joint observa-
tion of HS 0810+2554 with Chandra and NuSTAR will
provide improved constraints of the kinematic and ion-
ization properties of the ultrafast outﬂow and reﬂector/s
of HS 0810+2554 by ﬁtting outﬂow/reﬂection models to
the 0.3–80 keV spectrum of HS 0810+2554.

4. SUMMARY

The 100 ks Chandra and 46 ks XMM-Newton obser-
vations of the gravitationally lensed z = 1.51 narrow ab-
sorption line quasar HS 0810+2554 indicate (at > 99%
conﬁdence) the presence of a highly ionized and rela-
tivistic outﬂow in this highly magniﬁed object. These
observations conﬁrm our marginal detection of an ultra-
fast wind in this object based on an earlier 5 ks Chandra
observation.

We summarize the main results from the latest X-ray

observations of HS 0810+2554 as follows:

1. A highly ionized and relativistic wind is present
in both the 100 ks Chandra and 46 ks XMM-Newton
observations of HS 0810+2554. We ﬁnd the ionization
parameter of the X-ray outﬂowing absorber to lie in the
range log(ξ/erg cm s−1) = 3.2−3.3, the hydrogen col-
umn density to lie within the range NHabs = 2.9–3.4 ×
1023 cm−2, and the outﬂow velocity components to lie
within the range vabs = 0.1−0.41 c.

2. Our interpretation of the relativistic nature of the
outﬂow is consistent with the detection of a Si xiv ab-
sorption line blueshifted by the same amount as the
highly ionized Fe line in the 100 ks Chandra spectrum of
image A+B. The presence of an outﬂow is also supported
by the detection of a P-Cygni proﬁle in the 100 ks Chan-
dra spectrum of image A+B. We constrain the covering
factor fc of the relativistic wind by ﬁtting the P-Cygni
proﬁle. We ﬁnd fc = 0.6+0.2
−0.3 indicating that the wind is
wide-angled and therefore important in the feedback pro-
cess by providing eﬃcient coupling of the outﬂow to the
surround intergalactic medium. The value of the cover-
ing factor obtained in our analysis using windabs is likely
an underestimate because of shielding of the outﬂow by
the accretion disk and thus provides a lower limit of the
true covering factor. We conclude that the covering fac-
tor of the wind in HS 0810+2554 is likely large with fc
>
∼ 0.6, assuming disk shielding.

3. A hard X-ray excess component is detected in the
46 ks XMM-Newton spectrum of HS 0810+2554. A pos-
sible explanation is reﬂection from nearby and/or dis-
tant regions of the accretion disk. By modelling the
hard X-ray excess as blurred relativistic reﬂection from
the accretion disk we constrain the inclination angle of
∼ 45◦ (90% conﬁdence). We note that
the disk to be <
this result is model dependent (see Table 5) and that
due to the relatively low S/N of the available spectra of
HS 0810+2554 several parameters of model 7 (see Table
5) were ﬁxed during the spectral ﬁt. A scheduled joint
Chandra and NuSTAR observation of HS 0810+2554 will
provide tighter constraints on the properties of the re-

ﬂector. Such a small inclination angle, if conﬁrmed with
the follow-up observations, is consistent with models that
posit NAL quasars as objects observed at relative low in-
clination angles.

4. The mass-outﬂow rate of HS 0810+2554 is found to
˙M = 1.5−3.4 M⊙ yr−1 and is compara-
lie in the range of
ble to the accretion rate 1 M⊙ yr−1 (assuming an accre-
tion eﬃciency of 0.1 and an Eddington ratio of 0.1). The
large fraction of kinetic to electromagnetic luminosity of
(ǫk = 9+8
−6) implies that radiation driving alone cannot
explain the acceleration of this highly-ionized absorber.
Magnetic driving likely provides a signiﬁcant contribu-
tion to the acceleration of the X-ray wind.

5. The deeper X-ray observations provide tighter
constraints on the properties of a nearby group of
galaxies that contributes to the gravitational lensing of
HS 0810+2554. In particular, joint ﬁts to the Chandra
and XMM-Newton spectra of the group indicate a plasma
temperature of Te ∼ 0.8 keV, an abundance of A ∼ 0.53
solar and a redshift of z ∼ 0.08. We used these new
constraints to improve our lens model of HS 0810+2554.
We ﬁnd that the total magniﬁcation of the background
quasar is µABCD ∼ 103.

6. The Chandra spectra of images C and A+B diﬀer
signiﬁcantly. We propose as a possible explanation for
the diﬀerence between these spectra a microlensing event
occurring in image C. This interpretation is consistent
with the anomalous X-ray ﬂux ratio of image C (see Table
4). Microlensing may lead to energy shifts of the iron
emission lines due to general and relativistic eﬀects as
found in the lensed quasar RX J1131−1231(Chartas et
al. 2016).

a Model 6 consists of a power law, neutral absorption at the source, two outﬂowing ionized absorbers at the source, scattering of the low
velocity outﬂowing component (abs1), and neutral Compton reﬂection with self-consistent Fe and Ni lines (PEXMON). The normalizations of the
direct(reﬂection) component is the photon ﬂux at 1 keV (photons keV1 cm−2 s−1) of the power law(reﬂection) component only and in the earth
frame. Model 7 consists of a power law, neutral absorption at the source, two outﬂowing ionized absorbers at the source, scattering of the low
velocity outﬂowing component (abs1), and relativistic reﬂection oﬀ an ionized disk. Parameters of model 7 include the spin of the black hole (a),
the inner and outer radii of the accretion disk rin and rout, respectively. For models 6 and 7 Rfrac is deﬁned as the ratio of the ﬂux reﬂected by
the disk to the ﬂux of the direct power-law component in the rest-frame energy band of 20−40 keV. Parameters listed as ﬁxed are held ﬁxed to
the listed value during the ﬁt. All model ﬁts include the Galactic absorption toward the source (Dickey & Lockman 1990).
bAll absorption-line parameters are calculated for the rest frame.
cSpectral ﬁts were performed using the χ2 statistic and all errors are for 90% conﬁdence unless mentioned otherwise.
dP (χ2/ν) is the probability of exceeding χ2 for ν degrees of freedom if the model is correct.

Note. — The parameters assumed in the estimates of the kinematics of the absorbers are taken from the best-ﬁt values obtained from model 5
of Table 4 and model 7 of Table 5. We adopt a mean value for the bolometric luminosity of LBol = 1.8 ± 1.3 × 1045erg s−1, based on the X-ray,
UV, and optical bolometric corrections. The eﬃciency of the outﬂow is deﬁned as ǫk = (1/2) ˙M v2/Lbol.
