Abstract

The BPS Skyrme model is a model containing an SU (2)-valued scalar ﬁeld, in which
a Bogomol’nyi-type inequality can be satisﬁed by soliton solutions.
In this model, the
energy density of static conﬁgurations is the sum of the square of the topological charge
density plus a potential. The topological charge density is nothing else but the pull-back
of the Haar measure of the group SU (2) on the physical space by the ﬁeld conﬁguration.
As a consequence, this energy expression has a high degree of symmetry: it is invariant to
volume preserving diﬀeomorphisms both on physical space and on the target space. We
demonstrate here, that in the BPS Skyrme model such solutions exists, that a fraction
of their charge and energy densities are localised, and the remaining part can be any far
away, not interacting with the localised part.

1 The model considered

The Skyrme model [1, 2, 3] is a solitonic model of baryons. It contains an SU(2) valued scalar
ﬁeld, U, identiﬁed with the pion ﬁeld, and baryons emerge in it as topological solitons. For a
review, see Ref. [4]. In Ref. [5, 6, 7], a variant of the model has been put forward and termed
the BPS Skyrme model, in which solutions satisfying a Bogomol’nyi type bound are admitted
[8, 9]. The model has been used to describe baryons [5, 6, 7, 10], nuclei [11], and, with coupling
to gravity, neutron stars [12, 13].

In the present paper, the BPS Skyrme model is considered, and it is demonstrated that
due to its high degree of symmetry, the model also possesses some remarkable features: with
somewhat less restrictive boundary conditions, solutions with ﬁnite energy but non-integer
charge are obtained. Note, however, that this property is expected to be lost in perturbed
models, therefore it does not aﬀect the phenomenological applicability of the model. We would
also like to mention, that in non-BPS and baby variants of the Skyrme model, states that
can be considered bound states (or molecules) of skyrmions with fractional charge have been
obtained in Ref. [14, 15, 16]. For fractional-charge conﬁgurations in U(1) gauge theory with
regular ﬁeld-strength on a two-sphere, see Refs. [17, 18], and for fractionally charged self-dual
solutions in an SU(2) gauge theory, Ref. [19].

The BPS Skyrme model is deﬁned with the action

S =Z d4xL =Z d4x(cid:2)−λ2π2BµBµ − µ2V(cid:3) ,

1

(1)

where Bµ is the topological current density, deﬁned as

Bµ =

1
24π2 ǫµνρσ Tr(LνLρLσ) , Lµ = U †∂µU ,

(2)

where U is the SU(2) valued meson ﬁeld, and ǫµνρσ is the four-dimensional Levi-Civitá tensor.
The potential V is assumed to be a function of Tr U only, e.g., V = (1 − (Tr U)/2)a with a
a positive real parameter (e.g., a = 1, 3, . . . ). The constants λ and µ can be scaled away by
suitable rescalings of the coordinates and ﬁelds [5, 6, 7, 10, 20].

Let us ﬁrst calculate the time-like component of the topological current, the topological

charge density,

B 0 = −

1
24π2 ǫijk Tr(LiLjLk) =

1
8π2 (Tr(L3L2L1) − Tr(L1L2L3)) ,

(3)

where ǫijk is the three-dimensional Levi-Civitá tensor. The charge density in Eq. (3) is the pull-
back of the invariant volume form of the group SU(2), therefore, it is invariant to all volume
preserving diﬀeomorphisms on both the physical and on the target space [5, 6, 7].

For static conﬁgurations, all but the time-like component of Bµ vanish, and the energy

density calculated from the action (1) is

E =Z d3xE =Z d3x(cid:2)λ2π2(B 0)2 + µ2V(cid:3) ,

(4)

which, as a consequence of the invariance of the charge, is also invariant to volume preserving
diﬀeomorphisms both on physical and group space.
In what follows, λ and µ will be taken to be one.

2 Skyrmions

Let us now consider spherically symmetric skyrmion solutions of the BPS Skyrme model. A
simple Ansatz for spherical symmetry is obtained as follows [5, 6, 7]. Let

U = exp(if σˆn) ,

where σ = (σ1, σ2, σ3) denotes the Pauli matrices, and n is a unit vector ﬁeld,

ˆn = (sin ϑ cos nϕ, sin ϑ sin nϕ, cos ϑ) ,

(5)

(6)

where 0 ≤ r < ∞, 0 ≤ ϑ ≤ π,−π < ϕ ≤ π denote the usual spherical coordinates in space,
and n is an integer. For such conﬁgurations, it is easily calculated, that the only non-zero
component of the topological current density is

B 0 = −

n
2π2r2 sin2 f (r)f ′(r) ,

(7)

and thus if f (0) = π, f (r → ∞) = 0, the winding number R d3xB 0 agrees with n. For the

energy density, we get

E = 4πZ drr2"(cid:26)nλ sin2 f

2πr2

2

f ′ ± µ√V(cid:27)

∓

2

nλµ√V sin2 f

πr2

f ′# .

(8)

The last term is topological, and thus, in each topological sector a minimum is obtained if the

2πµ√V r2
nλ sin2 f

f ′ = ∓

(9)

Bogomol’nyi-Prasad-Sommerﬁeld (BPS) equations hold, i.e., the term in the curly bracket in
Eq. (8) vanishes.

Solutions of the BPS equation can be found numerically [20]. In the a = 1 case, a closed
form solution is also known [5]. Note also, that solutions of the radial equation (9) with diﬀerent
winding number n are related to each other via rescalings [5].

3 Solutions with fractional charge

Let us now use the invariance of the model against volume preserving diﬀeomorphisms to
construct solutions, where a fraction of the charge is in a large volume, and the rest is far away,
not interacting.

To this end, let us do the replacements n → N, ϕ → ˜ϕh, and r → ˜rh in the spherically

symmetric solution presented in Section 2, where

nϕ, if |ϕ| < π − h
ν
h2 (ϕ − π + h)2, if ϕ > π − h

nϕ +

− ˜ϕ(−ϕ), if ϕ < 0

˜rh = ( ˜ϕ′(ϕ))−1/3r ,

(10)

N ˜ϕ =


where h > 0 is a small number, N is the integer obtained by rounding n away from zero
and ν = N − n (if necessary, a smooth function approximating ˜ϕ may be used). Due to the
invariance of the energy density, the result is still a static solution of the ﬁeld equations.
Considering the physical quantities of the model, in the |ϕ| < π − h region, the energy
and the charge density of the model are moved closer to the origin. In this region, the total
charge is n, localised close to the origin, as in the spherically symmetric solution. On the other
hand, the remaining part of the charge, ν = N − n, and the corresponding energy, in the region
|ϕ| > π − h, is being pushed away from the origin, farther for smaller h. In this region, the
charge and energy densities are bounded by their respective values in the spherically symmetric
solution at the origin.

As h approaches zero, in a ﬁnite volume, the |ϕ| > π−h region becomes very thin, and, as the
energy and charge densities here are bounded, its total energy and charge become arbitrarily
small.
In this sense, it becomes unobservable. As a result, we get a solution, where only
a fraction of the charge is localised in an arbitrarily large volume, not interacting with the
remaining part far away.

For h → 0 the point-wise limit of our conﬁguration is also given by the Ansatz (5), however,
In this sense, we have constructed a skyrmion with

with n real (not necessarily integer).
fractional charge. This ﬁeld conﬁguration jumps at ϕ = ±π.

4 Conclusions

In the present paper, we have demonstrated, that the BPS Skyrme model admits solutions with
a non-integer charge localised in a volume that can be taken of any size, not interacting with

3

the remaining part. The localised part of the solution is spherically symmetric apart from a
thin band connecting it to the far away part, and approaches a fractional solution in the usual
Ansatz point-wise. The possibility of such solutions is a consequence of the high degree of
symmetry of the model. Using the symmetries of the model, the band connecting the fractional
skyrmion with its remaining part can be made arbitrarily thin, containing a negligible amount
of charge and energy.

For the existence of this solution, it is necessary, that in the BPS Skyrme model, large
changes in the ﬁeld variable over small distances can give small contribution to the energy,
resulting from the fact that the derivative term of a free scalar ﬁeld, quadratic in ﬁrst derivatives,
is absent from the energy. In other words, this is a consequence of the topological nature of the
charge and that the kinetic energy is the charge squared: the energy is insensitive to distances,
as far as volumes are preserved.

One of the motivations of the BPS Skyrme model is, that it describes a ﬂuid [5, 6, 7].
Adding terms which give a surface tension to the ﬂuid would make the energy of the bands
connecting the fractional skyrmion parts proportional to their area, in a sense, leading to a
conﬁning potential between them.
