(Dated: )

Semiconducting single-wall carbon nanotubes are classiﬁed into two types by means of orbital
angular momentum of valley state, which is useful to study their low energy electronic properties
in ﬁnite-length. The classiﬁcation is given by an integer d, which is the greatest common divisor of
two integers n and m specifying the chirality of nanotubes, by analyzing cutting lines. For the case
that d is equal to or greater than four, two lowest subbands from two valleys have diﬀerent angular
momenta with respect to the nanotube axis. Reﬂecting the decoupling of two valleys, discrete
energy levels in ﬁnite-length nanotubes exhibit nearly fourfold degeneracy and its small lift by the
spin–orbit interaction. For the case that d is less than or equal to two, in which two lowest subbands
from two valleys have the same angular momentum, discrete levels exhibit lift of fourfold degeneracy
reﬂecting the coupling of two valleys. Especially, two valleys are strongly coupled when the chirality
is close to the armchair chirality. An eﬀective one-dimensional lattice model is derived by extracting
states with relevant angular momentum, which reveals the valley coupling in the eigenstates. A
bulk-edge correspondence, relationship between number of edge states and the winding number
calculated in the corresponding bulk system, is analytically shown by using the argument principle,
which enables us to estimate the number of edge states from the bulk property. The number of edge
states depends not only on the chirality but also on the shape of boundary.

INTRODUCTION

Recent studies of quantum transport have revealed
that single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) contain
richer phenomena, especially in terms of the spin and val-
ley degrees of freedom.1 Fourfold degeneracy of SWNTs,
observed in the tunneling spectroscopy,2–11 has been
widely considered as an intrinsic property of SWNTs,
reﬂecting the two degenerate K and K′ valleys in the
two-dimensional (2D) Brillouin zone (BZ), together with
two spin states of up and down. Measurements for ultra-
clean SWNTs12–15 show ﬁne structures of lift of fourfold
degeneracy caused by the spin–orbit interaction.16–21 Re-
cent studies focused on the angular momenta of two val-
leys as a conserved quantity in disorder-free ﬁnite-length
metallic SWNTs (m-SWNTs).22,23 It is shown that the
two valleys have the same angular momentum for the so-
called metal-2 nanotubes, whereas they have diﬀerent an-
gular momenta for the metal-1 nanotubes.22,24 (The def-
initions of metal-1 and metal-2 are given in Sec. II.) For
ﬁnite-length m-SWNTs which has the same rotational
symmetry with the bulk, the two valleys are decoupled
and the spin–orbit interaction lifts the fourfold degener-
acy for the metal-1 nanotubes, whereas valley coupling
due to the inter-valley scattering at the ends lifts the four-
fold degeneracy, regardless of spin–orbit interaction, for
the metal-2 nanotubes.22,23 Valley coupling could play a
role for large lift of the fourfold degeneracy in the exper-
iments.7,9–11,15,25,26

Many of the quantum transport measurements have
been performed for the m-SWNTs,1–15 which could con-
tain narrow energy gap induced by curvature of nanotube

surface. Conducting of the semiconducting SWNTs (s-
SWNTs) has also been investigated by adjusting the gate
voltage.1,8,27,28 In fact, the s-SWNTs are double abun-
dant of the m-SWNTs.29 However, the relationship be-
tween valley, angular momentum, and the ﬁnite-length
eﬀect is not well analyzed for the s-SWNTs, even though
they play essential roles in the quantum transport mea-
surements. Here we will focus on the s-SWNTs.

In this paper, we will classify the s-SWNTs by means
of the angular momentum of the valley. We will show
that the classiﬁcation is performed by an integer d =
gcd(n, m), which is the greatest common divisor (gcd)
of n and m, where the integer set (n, m) speciﬁes the
chiral vector.29 (See Sec.
II for the deﬁnition of chiral
vector.) For the s-SWNTs with d ≥ 4, the two valleys
have diﬀerent angular momenta and the two valleys are
decoupled. For this case the spin–orbit interaction lifts
the fourfold degeneracy in the ﬁnite-length nanotubes, as
in the case of metal-1 nanotubes.22 On the other hand,
for the s-SWNTs with d = 1 and d = 2, the two valleys
have the same angular momentum and valley coupling
lifts the fourfold degeneracy, as in the case of metal-
2 nanotubes.22 Especially for the case of |n − m| = 2,
which is close to the armchair chirality, the two valleys
are strongly coupled. Note that d = 3, more generally
mod(d, 3) = 0, holds only for a part of m-SWNTs.
In
order to understand the coupling of two valleys, an eﬀec-
tive one-dimensional (1D) lattice model is derived and
analyzed. Chirality and edge shape dependences of the
number of edge states, as another intrinsic feature in
the ﬁnite-length nanotubes, are given by expanding the
theory for valley coupling. Especially, a bulk-edge cor-
respondence, relationship between the number of edge

states and the winding number given in the correspond-
ing bulk system, is analytically shown.

The present study reveals that the coupling of two val-
leys occurs in the majority of SWNTs, even for ultra-
clean tubes with clean edges, which conserve the angular
momentum of ideal bulk states of electrons. The val-
ley coupling appears as the lift of fourfold degeneracy,
regardless of the spin–orbit interaction. Moreover, the
bulk-edge correspondence for edge states in the semicon-
ducting energy gap reveals another feature of SWNTs as
topological insulating materials.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, classiﬁca-
tion of the s-SWNTs by means of the angular momentum
of the valley is given. In Sec. III, numerical calculation is
given for ﬁnite-length s-SWNTs, which shows the valley
coupling for d ≤ 2 cases.
IV, an eﬀective 1D
lattice model is derived (Sec.
IV A), eigenstates under
boundary is analyzed (Sec. IV B), and number of edge
states is given from both a mode analysis of boundary
condition and a topological viewpoint for the bulk 1D
lattice model (Sec. IV C). The conclusion is given in Sec.
V.

In Sec.

II. ANGULAR MOMENTA OF TWO VALLEYS

In order to discuss the angular momentum of SWNTs,
we ﬁrst redeﬁne the previous concept of cutting line,30
by using the helical–angular construction.31

Let us consider a SWNT deﬁned by rolling up the
graphene sheet in the direction of the chiral vector Ch =
na1 + ma2 ≡ (n, m), where n and m are integers spec-
ifying the chirality of SWNT, a1 = (√3/2, 1/2)a and
a2 = (√3/2,−1/2)a are the unit vectors of graphene,

a = 0.246 nm is the lattice constant.29 In this paper,
we consider the rolling of the graphene from the front
to the back, and, unless otherwise indicated, the case of
n ≥ m ≥ 0, which correspond to the “zigzag-right hand-
edness”, except for the zigzag (m = 0) and armchair
(n = m) nanotubes, according to Ref. 32. The nan-
otubes of opposite handedness, zigzag-left handedness,
are given for (m, n), or rolling of the graphene sheet from
the back to the front.32

A. Cutting line

Here we introduce the cutting line deﬁned under the
helical–angular construction,31 and show the angular mo-
mentum of K and K′ points for the m-SWNTs,22 which
are known in the previous studies.

To discuss the angular momenta of two valleys, it is
convenient to introduce an alternative set of unit vec-
tors, utilizing the rotational and the helical symme-
try of SWNT, Ch/d and R = pa1 + qa2.33,34 Here
d = gcd(n, m) is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of
n and m, and the integers p and q are chosen to satisfy

the relation of

mp − nq = d.

Translation with Ch/d corresponds to the Cd rotation
with respect to the nanotube axis. The vector R has az
and ∆θdt/2 components in the axis and circumference
directions, respectively, where

az =

T d
N

(2)

is the shortest distance between two A (B) atoms in the

axis direction, T = ap3(n2 + m2 + nm)/dR is the lattice

constant of the 1D nanotube, N = 2(n2 + m2 + nm)/dR
is the number of A (B) atoms in the 1D nanotube unit
cell, dR = gcd(2n + m, 2m + n),

∆θ = 2π

t1q − t2p

N

(3)

is the azimuth component of R in the cylindrical co-
ordinates, dt = |Ch|/π is the diameter of nanotube,
t1 = (2m + n)/dR, t2 = −(2n + m)/dR. There is an
arbitrarity to deﬁne p and q since R + αCh/d also sat-
isﬁes the deﬁnition of R, with α = 0, 1,··· , d − 1. Two
reciprocal lattice vectors, which are conjugate to Ch/d
and R, are given by

Q1 = −qb1 + pb2, Q2 =

m
d

b1 −

b2,

(4)

where b1 = (2π/a)(1/√3, 1) and b2 = (2π/a)(1/√3,−1)
are the reciprocal lattice vectors of graphene, and the
relations Q1·Ch/d = Q2·R = 2π, Q1·R = Q2·Ch/d = 0
hold. The wavevector in the ﬁrst BZ is expressed by

k = µ

+ k

,

Q2
|Q2|

with

µ = 0, 1,··· , d − 1, and, 0 ≤ k <

2π
az

.

(5)

(6)

Note that |Q2| = 2π/az. The discretization of µ is due to
the periodic boundary condition in the circumference di-
rection, which requires k · Ch/2π is an arbitrary integer.
The integer µ is the orbital angular momentum around
the nanotube axis, and each line in the 2D k-space spec-
iﬁed by µ is called cutting line.

In comparison to the conventional formulation,29 we
have the relations, K1 = Q1/d + Q2∆θ/2π and K2 =
Q2d/N , where K1 represents the separation of cutting
lines and K2 is the vector of short cutting lines in the
conventional formulation, and they are orthogonal each
other. The cutting lines in the conventional formulation
are given by µK1 + kK2/|K2| with µ = 0,··· , N − 1
and −π/T ≤ k < π/T . The present formulation of 2D
BZ by Eq. (5) is essentially the same with that given in
our previous study,22 in which the rectangular shape of
2D BZ is given by the translation of the triangle at the

corner of the present parallelogram shape of 2D BZ by
(d∆θ/2π) Q2. It is convenient to use the two reciprocal
lattice vectors Q1 and Q2 in the present formulation,
rather than K1 and K2, to specify not only the angular
momenta of two valleys,22 but also the closest positions
of K and K′ points on the cutting lines, as shown below.

A K′ point is speciﬁed by −−→Γ K′ = −−−→Γ K. By compar-

ing Eqs. (5) and (7), it is concluded that the SWNT is
metallic when mod(2n + m, 3) = 0,29 because the cutting

where 0 ≤ µK, µK ′ ≤ d − 1, pass through the K and K′
points, respectively, whereas it is semiconducting when
mod(2n + m, 3) 6= 0 because there is no cutting line
which passes the K or K′ points. Here we used the
property that the cutting line of µ is equivalent to that
of mod(µ, d). Further, the m-SWNTs are classiﬁed into
metal-1 (dR = d) and metal-2 (dR = 3d).29 Two diﬀerent
6= 0 pass through K and
cutting lines µK 6= 0 and µK ′
K′ points, respectively, for metal-1, while, the cutting
line µK = µK ′ = 0 passes through both K and K′ points
for metal-2, as already proven in Ref. 22. The K (K′)
point on the line µK (µK ′) is given by

kK ′ =

mod(2p + q, 3),

mod(−2p − q, 3).

(10)

(11)

Especially for the metal-2 nanotubes, since the relation
mod(2p + q, 3) = mod(2m/d, 3) holds, kK = 4π/3az
(2π/3az) and kK ′ = 2π/3az (4π/3az) for mod(m/d, 3) =
1 (2), as shown in Ref. 22.

B. Classiﬁcation of s-SWNTs

Using the new deﬁnition we classify the s-SWNTs. For
the s-SWNTs, the point closest to the K point on the
cutting lines is given by,

line which passes through a point closest to a K (K′)

for the s-SWNTs. From Eq. (12), the closest cutting line
to the K point is given by

and that to the K′ point is given by

µ1′ = mod(cid:18)−

Therefore, the condition that the two cutting lines µ1
and µ1′ are identical is expressed by,

(15)

Since both n and m are multiple of d, Eq. (15) holds
only for d = 1 and d = 2. For the s-SWNTs with d ≥ 4,
µ1 and µ1′ are nonequivalent. (See cutting lines in Fig.
1, as examples for d = 2 and d = 4.) Here we exclude the
case of d = 3, which holds only for a part of m-SWNTs.
For d = 1, µ1 = µ1′ = 0. For d = 2, we get µ1 = µ1′ = 1
because they cannot be 0 by their deﬁnitions for d ≥ 2.
It is also known from Eq. (12) that a point k1 (k1′ ) on
the line µ1 (µ1′ ), at which the bottom of the conduction
band and the top of the valence band appears from K
(K′) valley, is given by

Figure 2 shows the classiﬁcation of SWNTs up to 2n +
m = 78. The ratio of the metal-2 nanotubes in the m-
SWNTs, for both left and right handedness,32 in 0.5nm <
dt < 3nm is about 75%, and that of d ≤ 2 nanotubes in
the s-SWNTs is about 85%. This indicates that the two
valleys have the same angular momentum in the majority
(82%) of SWNTs. (See Fig. 2 (b) for the ratios.)

It is expected that ﬁnite-length s-SWNTs with d ≥ 4,
as well as the metal-1 nanotubes with d ≥ 3,22 with Cd
rotational symmetry exhibit fourfold degeneracy since µ
and d − µ, which is equivalent to −µ, states degener-
ate under the time reversal symmetry, and the cutting
lines closest to K and K′ are inequivalent for d ≥ 3.
It is important to note that the fourfold degeneracy is
lifted by the spin-orbit interaction that keeps the time-
reversal symmetry,20 which will be conﬁrmed in numeri-
cal calculation presented in the Appendix A. On the other
hand, for ﬁnite-length s-SWNTs with d ≤ 2, as well as
the metal-2 nanotubes,22 the strong valley coupling can
occur, which breaks the valley degeneracy regardless of
spin–orbit interaction, even the boundary is clean so as
to keep the rotational symmetry of bulk, which will be
shown in the next section.

III. VALLEY COUPLING IN FINITE-LENGTH

S-SWNTS

In this section, we will show features of valley coupling
in the numerical calculation of the energy levels of ﬁnite-
length s-SWNTs with d ≤ 2.
In Fig. 3 (a), we show the numerically calculated en-
ergy levels εl near the highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO), where l is the index of the energy level num-
bered from HOMO (l = 0) in ascending order of the
energy for (7,3) nanotube of 50.18 nm length. Here the
origin of the energy is set to be (εl=1 + εl=0)/2 = 0.
The boundary is constructed by terminating at the plane
orthogonal to the nanotube axis and removing Klein-
type terminations at which terminated site neighbors two
empty sites. This is categorized as the minimal boundary,
in which the edge structure is selected to have minimum
numbers of empty sites [dashed circles in Fig. 5 (a)] and
dangling bonds, and these numbers are the same,36 for
both ends. The diagrammatic picture of the left end is
shown in Fig. 5 (a). The calculation is done using the
extended tight-binding method for the ﬁnite-length nan-
otubes,22 in which π and σ orbitals of carbon atom are
taken into account, and the hopping and the overlap inte-
grals between two atoms evaluated by the ab initio calcu-

the three-dimensional structure are included. The opti-
mized position of carbon atoms is utilized from the previ-
ous calculation.20 To eliminate the dangling bonds in the
numerical calculation, each single dangling bond at the
ends is terminated by a hydrogen atom. The atomic spin–
orbit interaction on each carbon atom are taken into ac-
count.20 Unless otherwise indicated, the value of VSO = 6
meV for the atomic spin–orbit interaction is used in the
calculation.

The energy levels of εl ≤ −0.424 eV (l ≤ −2), which
are originated from the valence band, and εl ≥ 0.535 eV
(l ≥ 3), originated from the conduction band, are shown
in Fig. 3 (a). In the energy gap, there are fourfold degen-
erate localized states near the ends (l = −1, 0, 1, 2), two
spin degenerate states polarized at B sublattices at left
end and two spin degenerate states polarized at A sub-

5

lattices at right end, at ε = 0, not shown in the ﬁgure),
known as the edge states,38–41 which will be discussed
in Sec. IV C. Due to the hopping to next nearest neigh-
bor and farther sites, the localized states appear below
the center of the energy gap.42 As increasing (decreasing)

top of the valence band), the level separation, εl+1 − εl,
gradually increases to the constant value reﬂecting the
changing from the quadratic to linear energy dispersion
of the energy bands, as shown in Fig. 3 (b). The energy
levels are nearly degenerate in fourfold. In Fig. 3 (c), we
show intensity plot of Fourier transform of wavefunction
on A sublattice for each level as a function of k. [A tiny
magnetic ﬁeld (B = 10−6 T, corresponding spin splitting
is ∼ 10−8 meV) parallel to the nanotube axis is applied
to extract the spin-up majority states in the numerical
calculation. The intensity plot is zone-folded in the 1D
BZ of nanotube and is smoothed by a Gaussian func-
tion.] The fourfold degeneracy reﬂects the decoupling of
the two valleys, which is conﬁrmed that each eigenstate
is formed from leftgoing and rightgoing states in a sin-
gle valley, as shown in Fig. 3 (c). The small lift of the
fourfold degeneracy, shown in lower panel of Fig. 3 (b),
is due to the spin–orbit interaction and the small valley
coupling in the ﬁnite-length eﬀect, as seen in the ﬁnite-
length metal-2 nanotubes.22

For comparison in Fig. 3, the energy levels εl and
level separation εl+1 − εl for (6,4) nanotube of 50.14 nm
length with a minimal boundary are shown in Figs. 4
(a) and 4 (b), respectively. As in the case of Fig. 3, the
energy levels for the four edge states exist within the en-
ergy gap at εl = 0 for l = −1, 0, 1, 2, two states polarized
at B sublattices at left end and two states polarized at
A sublattices at right end (not shown in the ﬁgure). In
contrast to the case of Fig. 3, except near the bottom or
the top of the energy gap, the energy levels show twofold
degeneracy reﬂecting the strongly couple of two valleys,
which is conﬁrmed in the intensity plot of Fig. 4 (c). The
oscillatory behavior of two- and fourfold degeneracies re-
ﬂects the asymmetric group velocity in the same valley,
as seen in the m-SWNTs.22,43 The behaviors of decou-
pling or strong coupling of two valleys demonstrated by
the numerical calculation can be understand by the ef-
fective 1D lattice model, which is discussed in the next
section.

IV. EFFECTIVE 1D LATTICE MODEL

An eﬀective 1D lattice model, which includes only the
nearest neighbor hopping term for the spinless case, ex-
hibits not only the microscopic mechanism of valley cou-
pling but also the number of edge states appearing in the
energy gap.

A. Derivation of eﬀective 1D lattice model

model for π electrons, H = PrP3

First, we derive an eﬀective 1D lattice model for each
angular momentum (e.g., µ = 0 for d = 1, µ = 0 and
µ = 1 for d = 2 s-SWNTs) from the nearest neighbor
tight-binding Hamiltonian. To derive the eﬀective model,
we restrict ourselves in the nearest neighbor tight-binding
j=1 γjc†A,rcB,r+∆j +
H.c., where c†σ,r (cσ,r) is the creation (annihilation) op-
erator of π electron on σ atom (σ =A, B) at site r, ∆j
is the vector from A to nearest j-th B atom (j = 1, 2, 3),
and γj is the hopping integral between A and j-th B
atom. The atom position is expressed by the two unit
vectors as r = νCh/d + ℓR, where ν = 0, 1,··· , d − 1,
and the integer ℓ points the lattice position in the axis
direction in units of az.

By employing the Fourier transform in the Q1 direc-

tion to the operator,

the Hamiltonian is decomposed into projected Hamil-

µ=0 Ho,µ,
Ho,µ =PℓP3
d ∆νj µc†A(µ,ℓ)cB(µ,ℓ+∆ℓj ) +H.c. Here
∆νj and ∆ℓj for the three nearest neighbor carbon atoms
are the Ch/d and R components of ∆j, respectively,
and their explicit forms are ∆ν1 = (p − q) /3, ∆ν2 =
− (2p + q) /3, ∆ν3 = 2q + p/3, and ∆ℓj = −(n − m)/3d,
(2n + m)/3d, −(2m + n)/3d for j = 1, 2, 3, respectively.
By extracting the relevant Ho,µ, one gets an eﬀective 1D
Hamiltonian.

For the s-SWNTs, as well as the metal-1 nanotubes,
since ∆ℓj and ∆νj are fractional numbers with three as
the denominator, translation conversion of the coordi-
nate for B sublattice such as ∆1 → 0 would be conve-
nient. This conversion makes A and B sublattices ter-
minated at the same ℓ = 1 site, which is convenient for
topological discussion which will be given in Sec. IV C.
Further, this conversion makes the hopping integrals in
the Hamiltonian real numbers for d = 1 and d = 2 cases,
as shown below. The Hamiltonian is modiﬁed under this
conversion, Ho,µ → Hµ, where

B. Eigenstate

To understand the coupling of two valleys in the eigen-
states, we will show how the eigenstates are constructed
from the leftgoing and rightgoing traveling waves in the
two valleys using the eﬀective 1D model. Hereafter, 1D
lattice site of the eﬀective 1D model is measured in units
of az, for simplicity, and 1D wavenumber is therefore
measured in units of 1/az.

For an eigenstate with energy ε of Hµ, which has the
amplitude φσℓ at σ-atom on ℓ-site satisfying the solution
of φσℓ+t = λtφσℓ, φBℓ = ηφAℓ,22 we have the following
simultaneous equations for λ and η,

Assumption of using the same hopping integrals γ = γj
is safely acceptable for the s-SWNTs, unlike the m-
SWNTs22 in which narrow gap is induced by the small
diﬀerence among γj reﬂecting the curvature of nanotube
surface. The simultaneous equations have 2(n/d + m/d)
sets of solutions (λ, η) because each equation is the
(n/d + m/d)th degree equation. We call A (B) mode
for a mode with |η| < 1 (|η| > 1) because the wavefunc-
tion is polarized at the A (B) sublattice. A mode with
|λ| < 1 (|λ| > 1) is a evanescent mode at the left (right)
side, and a mode with |λ| = |η| = 1 is a traveling mode
which extends in whole of the system.
In the low energy limit |ε/γ| ≪ 1, the roots of left hand
side of Eq. (22) [Eq. (23)] gives λ for the A [B] modes.
As shown in the Appendix B 1, the number of evanescent
modes at the left end for σ sublattice, Nσ, are given by
counting the number of roots in between two outermost
roots, which correspond to the modes with the longest
decay length, in the unit circle centered at the origin in
the complex plane, as follows;

that is less than or equal to x, and (nA, nB) = (0, 1)

|µ/d − 1/2| > 1/6 [< 1/6], or, mod(2n/d + m/d, 3) = 2
and |µ/d − 1/2| < 1/6 [> 1/6]. The integers nσ are
summarized in Table II.
When the energy increases (decreases) from ε = 0, the
evanescent modes with the longest decay length change to
the traveling modes, as shown in Fig. 6. Let us explicitly
consider the cases of d = 1 where µ = 0 is only the
independent cutting line, and µ = 1 for d = 2, for which
Hµ contains the states closest to both K and K′ points,
as discussed in Sec. II. Since the modes we focus on are
closest to

unit circle centered at the origin. Blue and red ﬁlled marks
are the solutions for A and B modes, respectively, and black
ﬁlled circles on C1 are the solutions for the traveling modes,

A (B) modes at ε = 0.
Insets show the enlargements near
λτ =±1, and the dots between the open and ﬁlled marks show
the solutions for the energies in 0 ≤ |ε/γ| ≤ 0.4 with energy
interval of 0.4|γ|/100. Transition from evanescent modes to
traveling modes occurs at |ε/γ| = εgap/2 = 0.21. Arrows and
numbers show the changing of the modes when |ε| increases
in (1) 0 ≤ |ε| ≤ εgap/2, and (2) |ε| ≥ εgap/2.

At ε = 0, the B (A) modes with

(26)

are the modes with the longest decay length for the type-
1 (type-2) s-SWNTs. When the energy increases (de-
creases) to ε = bεgap/2, which corresponds to the energy
bottom (top) of the conduction (valence) band for b = 1

(b = −1), the mode of the longest decay length together
with the conjugated mode [(λ, η) ↔ (1/λ∗, 1/η∗)] are
continuously changing to the doubly degenerate modes
with λ = λτ at each τ valley, where εgap = 2|γ|a/√3dt.

When the energy increases or decreases further to

ε = b|γ|

(27)

the doubly degenerate modes split into the leftgoing (r =
−1) and rightgoing (r = 1) traveling modes with

λτ rk = exp [i (τ k1 + rk)]

(28)

at each τ valley, where k > 0. The above changing of
the modes is seen in Fig. 6 in the λ complex plane for
(n, m) = (6, 4), d = 2 and µ = 1 [see the modes labeled
by τ = 1 (τ = −1), which correspond to the modes of
K (K′) valley]. During the energy changing, the other
modes remain almost unchanged, as shown that the ﬁlled
and open marks are overlapped in Fig. 6. Since the
two evanescent modes of B [A] sublattice at the zero en-
ergy change to the traveling modes above and below the
energy gap, the integers Nσ is now given by Eq. (24)
with (nA, nB) = (0,−1) [(−1, 0)] for the type-1 [type-
2] s-SWNTs. The integers nσ for the energy inside and
outside the energy gap are summarized in Table III.

The wavefunction near the left end is written as the lin-

and below the energy gap, the wavefunction is written as

Under the boundary conditions, constriction on the co-
eﬃcients of the traveling modes is determined. As shown
in Figs. 5 (a) and (b), the following conditions hold for
the minimal boundary,

φb
Ak(ℓ) = 0 at ℓ = −n/d + 1,··· , 0,
φb
Bk(ℓ) = 0 at ℓ = −m/d + 1,··· , 0.

(32)

(33)

For the case of n > m ≥ 0, except for m = n − 2, the
number of the boundary conditions for A sublattice, n/d,
is larger or equal to that of the relevant modes, the two
fast oscillating modes and NA evanescent modes, NA + 2.
For (n, m) = (7, 3) as an example, the number of relevant
modes for A sublattice is NA + 2 = 6 and that of bound-
ary conditions for A sublattice is n/d = 7 in |ε| > εgap/2.
For this case, the boundary conditions Eq. (32) act as
the “ﬁxed boundary condition” for the envelope function
of A sublattice, which force the envelope function zero
near the left end, gb
Aτ k(ℓ → 0) = 0. To satisfy this con-
dition, the wavefunctions are formed from the leftgoing
and rightgoing traveling modes within the same valley
with the same amplitude, in order to have the following
functional form,

gb
Aτ k(ℓ) ∝ sin(kℓ).

(34)

Since the boundary conditions are satisﬁed by construct-
ing the eigenfunctions in each valley separately, two val-
leys are decoupled and the valley degeneracy occurs.
When the spin–orbit interaction turns on, Eq.
(34) is
satisﬁed for one of the two valleys while the component
of another valley is vanished, as seen in Fig. 3 (c).

For the case of m = n−2, the number of boundary con-
ditions is one less than that of the relevant modes for both
A and B sublattice, n/d = NA+1 and m/d = NB+1. For
the case of µ = 1 of (n, m) = (6, 4), as an example, the
numbers of boundary conditions for the A and B sublat-
tices are n/d = 3 and m/d = 2, respectively, and that of
relevant modes in A and B sublattices are NA +2 = 4 and
NB + 2 = 3, respectively, in |ε| > εgap/2. Therefore, the
wavefunctions for A and B sublattices can be determined
with an arbitrarity of the amplitude. In addition, by em-
ploying the similar analysis of our previous study for the
m-SWNTs,22 which is given in Appendix B 3, it is shown
that the coeﬃcients satisfy |cb
σ,τ =−1,−r,k|
and cb
σ,τ =−1,r,k = 0, or equivalently, the
ﬁrst term in Eq. (29) is written as

is the phase diﬀerence between the two traveling modes,
ϕ = arg cb
σ,τ =1,r,k − arg cb
σ,τ =−1,−r,k. Therefore, we have
the strong coupling of two valleys, as in the case of the
armchair nanotubes or the chiral metal-2 SWNTs with
so-called the orthogonal boundary.22 Near the top of the
valence band and bottom of the conduction band, on the

other hand, two valleys are decoupled since the eigen-
states are constructed from the leftgoing and rightgoing
states in the same valley to satisfy the boundary condi-
tions, as also discussed in details in Appendix B 3.
It
should be noted that the strong valley coupling could
occur for the other chiralities than m = n − 2 for the
s-SWNTs with other boundaries, as in the case of the
metal-2 nanotubes.22

For the case of m > n ≥ 0, the case of zigzag-left hand-
edness, the similar discussion with above is employed: we
have the ﬁxed boundary condition for the envelop func-
tion of B sublattice at the left end, except for the case of
m = n + 2 in which the strong valley coupling occurs.

C. Edge state

The number of edge states appeared at ε = 0 is eval-
uated by the diﬀerence between the number of indepen-
dent evanescent modes and the number of boundary con-
ditions, as in the case of previous discussions for graphene
with certain boundaries36 and for the m-SWNTs.22 For
the case of n > m ≥ 0, the number of edge states which
are localized at A and B sublattices at the left end are
given by,

N (L,A)

edge = 0, N (L,B)

edge = NB −

m
d

,

(36)

respectively, for each µ and each spin state. Since the
number of boundary conditions is larger or equal to that
of the relevant modes for A sublattice, the number of
edge states for A sublattice is zero. As shown in Ap-
pendix B 4, these edge states appear only at ε = 0. The
numbers of edge states are estimated using Eq. (24) with
Table II. For instance, N (L,B)
edge = 1 in (n, m) = (7, 3) nan-
otube. For (6, 4) nanotube, N (L,B)
edge = 0 for µ = 0 and
N (L,B)
edge = 1 for µ = 1. Since the numbers estimated
by Eq. (36) give the edge states for each spin and each
end, therefore total number of edge states is 4 for both
(7, 3) and (6, 4) nanotubes, which is consistent with the
numerical calculation in Figs. 3 and 4.

As an alternative way to evaluate the number of edge
states, we can employ the theory of topological catego-
rization for the bulk systems.44,45 The winding number
is frequently discussed in topological insulating materi-
als. For the SWNTs, the winding number for the angular
momentum µ, wµ, is given by

wµ =

|σkµi is the Bloch state of σ sublattice with wavenumber
k and the angular momentum µ. Since the integral of
Eq. (38) gives phase accumulation from k = 0 to k = 2π
for the function with 2π periodicity, the winding num-
ber of Eq. (37) is an integer. Further, under continuous
changing of the system parameters such as the hopping
integrals γj, the winding number is invariant, staying at
an integer value, as long as it is well-deﬁned value. In
fact, the winding number is well-deﬁned value for a sys-
tem with a ﬁnite energy gap, in which fµ(k) is ﬁnite value
for any k and then arg fµ(k) is well-deﬁned value for any
0 ≤ k < 2π. Note that energy gap closes at k, at which
fµ(k) = 0 and thus arg fµ(k) cannot be deﬁned. When
a metallic phase appears during the changing of system
parameters, we may have a topological phase transition,
which could be induced by applying the magnetic ﬁeld
for m-SWNTs with narrow energy gap.22,46

The winding number has been widely used as the num-
ber of edge states for the topological systems, as well
as other topological invariants, in the context of catego-
rization of materials by their topological properties.47–49
For the integer quantum Hall systems, it is well-known
that the ﬁlling number of the Landau levels as the bulk
quantity, which is known to be a topological invariant
called Chern number,50,51 and the number of edge chan-
nels have one-to-one correspondence.52–55 For 1D sys-
tems, on the other hand, only a few examples45,56–58 are
known to show exact one-to-one correspondence of the
winding number and the number of edge states, so-called
bulk-edge correspondence, which would be important for
better understanding of the topological materials. Here
we will show the bulk-edge correspondence: the winding
number is the number of edge states for the s-SWNTs by
using the results from the analysis in Sec. IV B with a
theorem in the complex analysis.

First, we show the numerically evaluated wµ values for
s-SWNTs of (n, m) = (7, 3) and (6, 4). Figure 7 shows the
phases of fµ(k) in for (a) (n, m) = (7, 3) and (b) (6, 4),
which is plotted on torus in which circumferential direc-
tion correspond to argument of fµ(k) as a function of k
in the direction around the torus, to show the “winding”
property clearly, in 0 ≤ k < 2π and 0 ≤ arg fµ < 2π. For
both cases, the total winding number, how many times
the curves winds around the circumference direction, is
one. Therefore, the total edge states including both ends
and two spin states is estimated to be four, which is con-
sistent with the numerical calculation showing the edge
states at l = −1, 0, 1, 2.
Let us show that the number of edge states estimated
from the mode analysis shown in Eq. (36) and the wind-
ing number in Eq.
(37) is identical for the s-SWNTs.
This “bulk-edge correspondence” is proven by using the
following theorem known as Cauchy’s argument principle
in the complex analysis,

The right hand side of Eq. (41) is exactly the left hand
side of Eq. (23), which has m/d poles at λ = 0 and, from
the analysis in Sec. IV B, NB roots inside C1. Using the
argument principle of Eq. (39) to Eq. (40), we have

wµ = NB −

(42)

which gives the same result with N (L,B)

showing the bulk-edge correspondence,

in Eq.

(36),

wµ = N (L,B)

(43)

Equation (43) shows that the winding number is the num-
ber of edge states for B sublattice at left end, which gives
more precise relation than other cases which show the re-
lation of winding number and the diﬀerence of number
of edge states between two sublattices.56–58

It would be worthful to mention the case of zigzag-left
handedness, m > n ≥ 0. For this case, the number of
edge states are given by,

N (L,A)
edge = NA −

n
d

, N (L,B)

edge = 0,

(44)

since the number of boundary conditions is larger or
equal to that of the relevant modes for B sublattice. Us-
ing the relation, NB − m/d = − (NA − n/d), which holds
at ε = 0 since nA = 1 − nB (see Table II), regardless of
left and right handedness, we get the following bulk-edge
correspondence for zigzag-left handedness,

wµ = −N (L,A)
edge .

(45)

We now get the bulk-edge correspondence for both
zigzag-right and left handedness cases. When sign of

10

the winding number is positive (negative), the number
of edge states for B (A) sublattice is given by the ab-
solute value of the winding number, while that of A (B)
sublattice is zero. The bulk-edge correspondence and the
number of edge states for A and B sublattices are sum-
marized in Table IV.

In general, the number of edge states depends on the
boundary shape. For the case that the termination of
A sublattice is at ℓ = ∆ℓ and that at B sublattice is
at ℓ = 1, for instance, the winding number which gives
the number of edge states should be calculated for the
diﬀerent bulk Hamiltonian as follows (the transformation
of the Hamiltonian from Hµ to H′µ is depicted in Fig. 8);

= wµ + ∆ℓ,

(47)

where

fµ(k)′ = hAkµ|H′µ|Bkµi = eik∆ℓfµ(k).

(48)

Note that both Eqs. (19) and (46) gives the same en-
ergy band and the same number of evanescent modes for
the same chirality (n, m), since their diﬀerence appears
only on the phase of oﬀ-diagonal term of the Hamiltonian
matrix. The number of boundary conditions for the A
sublattice increases by ∆ℓ while that for the B sublat-
tice decreases by ∆ℓ. Therefore, it can be checked that
the number of edge states is given by Eq. (47). Equa-
tion (47) explains the numerically observed diﬀerence of
the numbers of edge states between diﬀerent boundaries
shown in Figs. 2 and 3 in our previous study.22 Note
that Eq. (37) itself can be applied to evaluate the num-
ber of edge states for m-SWNTs with appropriate values
of γj to reproduce the narrow gap induced by the curva-
ture and the spin–orbit interaction.20 It is shown in the
Appendix C that wµ can be non-zero values, except for
the armchair nanotubes, by employing an analysis with
viewpoint of the symmetry of SWNTs.

µ to calculate winding number for number of edge states for
(n/d, m/d) = (7, 3) and ∆ℓ = 2.

Finally, we comment on the applicability of the sim-
pliﬁed 1D model. Perturbations could modiﬁed the edge
states quantitatively. For the metallic SWNTs with nar-
row energy gap, some edge states could exist in the en-
ergy band region because of the eﬀect of the hopping to
next nearest neighbor and farther sites.42 Breaking of the
Cd rotational symmetry also aﬀects as a perturbation to
the edge states, which mixes the edge states with diﬀer-
ent angular momenta. Even though such perturbations
changes the energies of edge states, the number of edge
states could keeps from the unperturbed case as long as
keeping ﬁnite energy gap, as shown in Fig. 8 in Ref. 22.

V. CONCLUSION

In summary, we studied the angular momentum of
two valleys in the s-SWNTs. The classiﬁcation of the
s-SWNTs in the sense of the angular momentum of val-
ley was given by the integer d. For the case of d ≥ 4, the
two valleys are decoupled in the ﬁnite-length nanotubes
which keep Cd rotational symmetry. Lift of the fourfold
degeneracy is caused by the spin–orbit interaction. On
the other hand, for the cases of d = 1 and d = 2, the
coupling of two valleys lifts the fourfold degeneracy. Es-
pecially, when |n − m| = 2, near the armchair chirality,
they are strongly coupled and the eﬀect of the spin–orbit
interaction is hidden by the large lift of the degeneracy by
valley coupling. The eﬀective 1D lattice model was intro-
duced by extracting relevant angular momentum states,
which explained the valley coupling in the eigenfunctions.
The analysis on the winding number provided the bulk-
edge correspondence for the edge states in the s-SWNTs.
The presented study showed that the valley coupling
in the eigenstates and the edge states in the semicon-
ducting energy gap strongly depends on the chirality and
boundary shape. The valley coupling occurs in the ma-
jority of both metallic and semiconducting SWNTs, even
they are defect free and they have clean edges which con-
serve the angular momentum of bulk states. The recent
progress on the separation59 and synthesis60 of single-

11

chirality SWNTs, or simultaneous measurement of quan-
tum transport, chirality and the boundary shape by high
resolution measurements in atomic scale such as the scan-
ning tunneling spectroscopy61,62 or high-resolution Ra-
man spectroscopy63 would enable to observe the chirality
and boundary dependences of the valley coupling and the
edge states.39–41

Appendix A: Discrete energy levels for ﬁnite-length

valley decoupled s-SWNTs

In Fig. 9, we show numerical calculation of the discrete
energy levels for (8, 4) nanotube, which has d = 4, as an
example for the case of d ≥ 4. The calculation is done
by the same method with Figs. 4 and 3, the extended
tight-binding method, for the ﬁnite-length of 50.07 nm,
with a minimal boundary for both ends which keep the
bulk Cd=4 rotational symmetry. The calculated energy
levels show fourfold degeneracy. This clearly shows the
decoupling of two valley.
In the actual situation, the
spin–orbit interaction lifts the fourfold degeneracy.

1. Number of evanescent modes

First, we give the detailed derivation of Eq. (24). In
the low energy limit |ε/γ| ≪ 1 and by using the same
hopping integrals γ = γj, we get the following equations
for the A and B modes, respectively, from Eqs. (22) and
(23),

is introduced since this conversion aligns the evanescent
modes of |λ| < 1, which also satisfy |λ′| < 1, on a curve
between λ′+ = ei2π/3 and λ′
− = ei4π/3, as shown in Fig.
10. Hereafter we explicitly show the analysis for A mode.
Eq. (B1) can be separated into two equations for absolute

where l′ is an arbitrary integer. Since Eqs.
(B4) and
(B5) have the same forms with the equations discussed
for the metallic condition,36 the similar discussion can be
employed for counting the evanescent modes, as shown
below.

The condition (B4) gives a closed curve passing λ′+
and λ′
in the complex plane, as shown by the blue curve
−
in Fig. 10. Then, n/d + m/d positions satisfying Eq.
(B5) on the curve give the solutions of λ′ of Eq. (B1),
as shown by the open marks on the blue curve in Fig.
10. The number of evanescent modes at the left end,
which satisfy |λ| < 1, is given by counting the number
of modes on the curve in between λ′+ and λ′
. The left
−
hand side of Eq. (B5) monotonically decreases when λ′
− on the curve, since arg(−1 − λ′)
moves from λ′+ and λ′
decreases when arg(λ′) increases. Note that arg(λ′
) and
−

arg(−1−λ′) are deﬁned in 0 ≤ arg(λ′
for this case. The values of l′ satisfying Eq. (B5) at λ′+

respectively. Note that l′

l′ < l′+ for the cases of mod(n/d + m/d, 3) = 1, 2 for
0 ≤ µ/d < 1/3, 1/3 < µ/d < 2/3, 2/3 < µ/d < 1, we
get NA. By employing the similar discussion with above,
we also get NB. The results are summarized in Eq. (24)
and in Table II.

|ε/γ| = 0.4. The same symbols with Fig. 6 are used. Closed
blue and red curves give the condition of Eq. (B4) for A mode
and the corresponding one for B mode, respectively, and open
marks on the curves are the solutions at ε = 0.

2. Evanescent modes and traveling modes

Here we will give the evanescent modes with the
longest decay length at ε = 0, Eq. (26), and their chang-
ing to traveling modes in Eq. (28) when energy increases
or decreases to |ε| > εgap/2. We restrict d = 1 and d = 2
cases, in which (λ∗, η∗) is also a set of solution for a solu-
tion (λ, η) since γj, ε and e−i 2π
j µ (j = 1, 2, 3) are real
numbers.

d ∆ν ′

First, we mention the relation between λ and λ′, which
is deﬁned by Eq. (B3), for the mode of λ = λτ = eiτ k1.
After some algebraic calculation, we get the correspond-
ing phase of λ = λτ in λ′ as follows;

[mod(2n + m, 3) = 2] s-SWNTs. Since Eq. (B8) is the
small correction, the solution near λ′+ (λ′
) corresponds
−
that at K (K′) valley.

The evanescent modes with the longest decay length
at ε = 0 have λ′ closest to λ′τ , and they are expressed by

λ′ = (1 − δr) exp(cid:20)iτ(cid:18) 2π

+ δϕ(cid:19)(cid:21) ,

(B10)

with small values of |δr| ≪ 1 and |δϕ| ≪ 1. For
small δr and δϕ, we have the relation, −1 − λ′ =
(1 − δr′)e−iτ (2π/3−δϕ′), where δr′ = δr/2 + √3δϕ/2 and
δϕ′ = −√3δr/2 + δϕ/2. Eq. (B4) gives the following

relation,

(n − m) δr = √3 (n + m) δϕ,

using Eqs. (B3) and (B7), then we get

Using Eq. (B38), we have

For the case of (ii) the linear dispersion region, in which
τ−rk| = π holds, Eq. (B46) is rewrit-

the relation |Φb

(B42)

Therefore, the condition of |D| = 0 is expressed by the

(B49)

(B43)

To satisfy Eq. (B44), we have

Φ+ − Φ− = Φb
where α is an arbitrary integer.

τ =1,r,k=0 − Φb

(B46)

By converting Eqs.
(B45) and (B46) into the form of
Eq (B32), we can check the explicit form of the envelope
functions which satisfy Eqs. (B43) and (B44).

Let us consider the following two cases, (i) near the
top of the valence band and bottom of the conduction
band, k ≪ az/dt, and, (ii) the linear dispersion region,
k ≫ az/dt. For the case of (i), since Φb

Eqs. (B45) and (B46) we have

By comparing Eqs. (B32) and (B47), we have rτ = 1
and Φτ = Φb
τ rk=0. For this case Eq. (B44) cannot be
satisﬁed, that is, |D| 6= 0. Therefore, c = 0, to satisfy
the boundary conditions. This means that the following
relation holds,

gb
στ k ∝ sin (kℓ)

(B48)

for the envelope functions of both σ = A and σ = B.
Similar to the case of m 6= n−2, the boundary conditions
are satisﬁed by constructing the eigenstate in each valley
separately. Therefore, two valleys are decoupled and the
valley degeneracy occurs.

(B50)

(B51)

When we apply the boundary conditions for the right
end, the second condition of Eq. (B51) is too strict to
determine quantized wavenumber. For d = 1 and d = 2
cases, the following relation on the wavefunctions reﬂect-
ing the parity symmetry of the eﬀective 1D Hamiltonian,
which corresponds to the C′2 rotational symmetry around
the axis perpendicular to the nanotube axis, is utilized
for the boundary conditions of the right end;22

(B52)

where pa = ±1 are the parity eigenvalues, ℓ = Ns is the
right end. Equation (B52) is calculated as,

cb

(B53)

For the case of Eq. (B51), Eq. (B53) is applied for both
r = 1 and r = −1. This is overcomplete to determine
the quantized wavenumber. Therefore, the condition of
Eq. (B50), which means the strong valley coupling, is
realized for the ﬁnite-length systems.

The condition that Eq. (B56) has non-trivial solutions,

which is the case of ε = 0, since EA = 0 and EB = 0,
and both DA and DB are not square matrices. At ﬁnite

Appendix C: Winding number under symmetry of

SWNTs

It is convenient to consider topological invariants in
each subspace of the Hilbert space under a symmetry.64

and

The topological property of the subsystem Hµ is charac-
terized by the winding number wµ deﬁned by,44,45

(C3)

is known as so-called the chiral operator which multiple
−1 on |Bkµi in the operated state. Since wµ can be either
positive or negative integers, the number of total edge
states at each end and each spin is given by Pµ |wµ|.

We put µ and k on the operator Γµ(k), to emphasize
that the operation acts in (k, µ) subspace of the Hilbert
space. The above deﬁned winding number is a topological
invariant since the bipartite system Hµ, as well as the
superconductors within the mean ﬁeld theory, satisﬁes so-
called sublattice (or chiral) symmetry, {Γµ(k), Hµ(k)} =
0.
The winding number corresponds to the number of
edge states on an end in which A and B sublattices are
[As examples, see left
terminated at the same position.
ends in Figs. 5 (a) and 5 (b)].
In other words, for a
case that A and B sublattices are terminated at diﬀer-
ent positions in the original 1D model, a modiﬁed model,
in which translation of B sublattice is performed for the
original model so as to have an end terminating both
sublattices at the same position, should be employed for
calculating the winding number.
In general, the num-
bers of edge states for the diﬀerent terminations are dif-
ferent each other, such as the minimal and orthogonal
boundaries discussed in Ref. 22 for the same bulk sys-
tems. Substituting Eqs. (C2) and (C3) for Eq. (C1), one
gets Eq. (37) which is convenient to evaluate the winding
number numerically. Since fµ(k) is a periodic function of
k of period 2π, the winding number is an integer. Here-
after we will show the winding number is a nontrivial
value, that is, wµ can be non-zero, under the symmetry
of SWNTs. In the following, we employ a generalized dis-
cussion for application to not only the SWNTs but also
other materials. The following discussion is restricted for
the spinless case.

For the time reversal operation, T , which changes

(k, µ) to (−k,−µ), we have

T Hµ(k)T −1 = H−µ(−k)

T Γµ(k)T −1 = ptΓ−µ(−k).

(C4)

(C5)

where pt = 1 for the SWNTs. When the operation also
changes the“pseudo-spin” σ to −σ, Eq. (C5) shows an-
ticommutation relation of pt = −1, which occurs for
so-called class DIII and CI superconductors in which
the Nambu pseudo-spin for the BCS particle-hole index
changes the sign under the T operation.47–49 Using Eqs.
(C4) and (C5) to Eq. (C1), it is shown that the winding
number of −µ subspace, w−µ, has the following relation,
(C6)

w−µ = ptwµ,

where we used the relation of hβ|O|αi = h˜α|T O†T −1| ˜βi
for the antilinear operator T and the anticommutation
relation of Γµ(k) and Hµ(k), where O is a linear operator
and tilde on the states indicates the antilinear operated
states, |˜αi = T |αi and | ˜βi = T |βi.65
In the sense of symmetry of point group, chiral SWNTs
contains C′2 rotational symmetry around the axis perpen-
dicular to the nanotube axis, in addition to Cd rotational
symmetry. The C′2 operation changes (k, µ) to (−k,−µ),
and the sublattice index σ to −σ, where −σ = B (A) for
σ = A (B). We have the relations

and

C′2Hµ(k)C′−1

2 = H−µ(−k)

C′2Γµ(k)C′−1

2 = p2Γ−µ(−k),

(C7)

(C8)

where p2 = −1. The anticommutation relation of Eq.
(C8) reﬂects that C′2 exchanges the A and B sublattices.
Then, we have the following relation for the winding num-
ber,

w−µ = −p2wµ.

(C9)

Since Eqs. (C6) and (C9) are identical for the present
case, which do not give extra restriction for the winding
number, it is concluded that wµ can be a non-zero value.
For a case of p2 = 1 reﬂecting the “pseudo-spin” keeping
C′2 operation, for instance, gives the opposite result that
wµ = 0, even though this is not the present case.
For the achiral SWNTs, the armchair and the zigzag
nanotubes, there exist extra symmetries. Let us consider
mirror reﬂection σv with a vertical mirror plane including
the nanotube axis, which changes µ to −µ while the direc-
tion of k is kept unchanged. Strictly speaking, σv changes
(k, µ) to (k′,−µ) where k′ = k− 2∆θµ has the additional
constant to k reﬂecting that Q1/d, which separates the
two neighbor cutting lines, has −∆θ/2π components in
Q2 direction in the oblique coordinates for (k, µ) (see Sec.
II A.) Further, σv exchanges the sublattice index A ↔ B
for the armchair nanotubes while it is unchanged for the
zigzag nanotubes. We have the relations

17

where pv = −1 (1) for the armchair (zigzag) nanotubes.
Using Eqs. (C10) and (C11) to (C1), we have the follow-
ing relation,

w−µ = pvwµ,

(C12)

The relation (C12), combined with Eq.
(C6), gives
wµ = 0 for the armchair nanotubes while it does not
give extra restriction for the zigzag nanotubes. For the
other symmetry, mirror symmetry with a plane perpen-
dicular to the nanotube axis, σh, we have σhΓµ(k)σ−1
h =
phΓµ(−k′), where ph = 1 (−1) for the armchair (zigzag)
nanotubes. The similar calculation with above gives

wµ = −phwµ,

(C13)

which accidentally gives the same results from Eqs. (C9)
and (C12). The inversion symmetry does not give any
further extra restrictions from above since the operation
is represented by the combination of C′2 and σv opera-
tions.

To complete the symmetric property of the winding
number, we also add the property from the d-fold rota-
tional symmetry, which requires [Cd, Hµ(k)] = 0. From
the relation CdΓµC−1
d = pdΓµ, where pd = 1 for the
SWNTs, and Eq. (C1), we have

wµ = pdwµ.

(C14)

This is nontrivial, however for the other case of pd = −1
where the d-fold rotation exchanges the A and B sublat-
tices, we have the winding number wµ = 0.

The obtained necessary conditions for the nontrivial

winding numbers are summarized as,

pd = −p2 = pv = −ph = 1,

(pt = 1),

(C15)

for the SWNTs and other bipartite insulators,

pd = p2 = −pv = −ph = 1,

(pt = −1),

(C16)

for the topological superconductors.66

As mentioned above, the SWNTs, except for the arm-
chair nanotubes, have nontrivial winding number. Here
the indices of the SWNTs are summarized as follows;

pt = 1, and, pd = −p2 = 1,

for the all SWNTs. In addition to Eq. (C17),

pv = −ph = 1,

for the zigzag nanotubes, and

pv = −ph = −1,

(C17)

(C18)

(C19)

and

σvHµ(k)σ−1

v = H−µ(k′)

σvΓµ(k)σ−1

v = pvΓ−µ(k′),

(C10)

(C11)

for the armchair nanotubes. As another example of the
application of Eq. (C15), we employ it to so-called the
Su-Schrieﬀer-Heeger model for the polyacetylene.67 The
system has no rotational symmetry (d = 1), p2 = −1,
pv = 1 and pt = 1 are all the relevant indices for the

system, then the system has nontrivial winding num-
ber, which is consistent with the well-known properties
of zero-energy edge states for the Su-Schrieﬀer-Heeger
model.68,69

The result that there is no edge states for the arm-
chair nanotubes from the above discussion is consistent
with the numerical calculation in Ref. 22 which does not
show any evanescent modes for the armchair nanotube
with the minimal boundary. Note that the small energy
gap of the order of sub-milli-electron-volt is induced by

the spin–orbit interaction.20 This property for the arm-
chair nanotubes is contrast to the other topological mate-
rials,70–72 in which edge states appears in the energy gap
induced by the spin–orbit interaction. We conﬁrmed by
the extended tight-binding calculation with large spin–
orbit interaction (VSO = 1 eV) for (n, m) = (6, 6), 50 nm
length armchair nanotube that there is no edge state in
the energy gap of ∼ 0.13 eV. The eﬀective 1D model with
additional imaginary hopping terms,16 to reproduces the
spin–orbit eﬀect, also showed winding number being zero
for the armchair nanotubes.
