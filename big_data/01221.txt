We model the inspiral of a compact object into a more massive black hole rotating very near the
theoretical maximum. We ﬁnd that once the body enters the near-horizon regime the gravitational
radiation is characterized by a constant frequency, equal to (twice) the horizon frequency, with an
exponentially damped proﬁle. This contrasts with the usual “chirping” behavior and, if detected,
would constitute a “smoking gun” for a near-extremal black hole in nature.

I.

INTRODUCTION

General relativity imposes a hard upper limit on how
fast a black hole can rotate. For a black hole of mass M ,
the angular momentum J must satisfy

J ≤ GM 2/c,

(1)

where G is Newton’s constant and c is the speed of light
(both hereafter set to unity). Above this value, the event
horizon disappears and the spacetime contains a naked
singularity. It is impossible to spin up a black hole above
this limit with any continuous process featuring reason-
able matter [1], and there is much evidence in favor of the
“cosmic censorship conjecture” [2] that no generic initial
data can produce a naked singularity.

Black holes that saturate the bound (1) are known as
extremal. More generally, extremal black holes are de-
ﬁned as those with zero Hawking temperature. Extremal
black holes play a key role in many theoretical arguments
investigating the nature of classical and quantum gravity,
such as cosmic censorship [3] and the quantum nature of
black hole entropy [4]. They have near-horizon regions
that possess additional emergent symmetries [5] and may
be governed by a holographic duality [6] in the spirit of
AdS/CFT [7]. At least in parameter space, they are a
hair’s breath from being naked singularities, the existence
of which would (in principle) allow experimental study of
quantum gravity from a distance. In light of their basic
role in theoretical work, it would be fascinating to dis-
cover an extremal black hole in nature.

In this paper we demonstrate a potential means of dis-
covery via a “smoking gun”: a signal which, if observed,
would conclusively establish the presence of a black hole
spinning at or extremely near the fundamental limit. We
consider the gravitational radiation from the inspiral of a
body into a more massive black hole. In the non-extremal
case, the wave amplitude and frequency increase slowly
in time until cutting oﬀ rapidly when the compact ob-
ject reaches the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO)
and plunges into the black hole.
If the black hole is
rapidly spinning, however, there is a new, near-horizon

FIG. 1. Gravitational waveforms from equatorial, quasi-
circular inspiral into ordinary and near-extremal black holes.
The black hole spins are a/M = 0.97 and a/M = 1 − 10−9,
respectively. We show the h+ component for a system viewed
face-on. The waveform begins when the particle crosses
r = 3.3M and ends when the particle reaches the ISCO; we do
not model the plunge or ringdown phase of the inspiral in this
work. The individual sinusoidal oscillations of the waveform
are too small to see on this scale (where we have assumed
a small mass-ratio). We also show (ﬁve times) the radiated
power, PGW. The masses of the primary and secondary are
denoted by M and µ, respectively, the distance to the binary
is D.

phase of the inspiral where the amplitude begins to de-
crease in time and the frequency saturates at the hori-
zon frequency – see Fig. 1. This can be understood from
the fact that the ISCO of a rapidly spinning black hole
is close to the horizon and allows access to the near-
horizon regime, where the gravitational-wave emission is

the black hole. The decay timescale is set by the masses
involved, with the total length of the signal set by the
black hole spin (diverging in the extremal limit). The
characteristic amplitude decrease is visible in the wave-
form provided the spin is at least J (cid:38) 0.9999M 2.

Can black holes of such high spin plausibly exist in na-
ture? From electromagnetic observations there is mount-
ing evidence for a wide distribution in the spins of both
stellar mass [8] and supermassive black holes [9, 10], in-
cluding measurements consistent, within measurement
error, with maximal spin J = M 2. Theoretically, ac-
cretion by cold particles can eﬃciently spin up a black
hole to very near the limit [11]. However, the inclu-
sion of other eﬀects (such as absorption of hot photons
[12]) generally limits the spin to more modest values.
The “Thorne limit” of J (cid:46) 0.998M 2 has generally been
adopted by the community as a reasonable guess for an
astrophysical upper limit. A method for beating the
Thorne limit is discussed in [13].

Our attitude, therefore, is that while near-extremal
black holes are perhaps not expected to exist in the uni-
verse, it is nevertheless highly worthwhile to search for
them. The signal we predict is in-band for ground-based
detectors [14, 15] at “intermediate” mass ratios and for
space-based detectors [16] at “extreme” mass ratios, with
horizon distances similar to ordinary black hole binaries
at these mass ratios. For ground-based detectors at cur-
rent sensitivity, it is not yet clear whether the distinctive
(“smoking gun”) features of this signal can be detected
with conﬁdence. We are optimistic it can be done, but
details remain to be ﬂeshed out. For the planned space-
based detector eLISA, however, detection would be un-
ambiguous.

Going beyond the classical gravity measurement, the
Kerr/CFT conjecture [6] holds that near-horizon, near-
extremal processes have a dual CFT description. As-
pects of this correspondence have already been tested for
bodies orbiting in the near-horizon region [17–19]. For
the inspiral calculation we perform here, the dual pro-
cess corresponds to return to equilibrium after a quan-
tum quench. If the conjecture is correct, observation of
near-horizon inspiral constitutes experimental study of
strongly coupled quantum ﬁeld theory.

Other known methods of measuring black hole spin are
unlikely to have the precision to discriminate between
the Thorne value of J = 0.998M 2 and the higher values
where the unique features of the extremal case become
important. Thus, to the many exciting possibilities of
the new astronomy of gravitational waves [20] we may
add one more: the discovery and study of extremal black
holes in nature.

The paper is organized as follows. First we provide
an analytical derivation of the basic “smoking gun” for
quasi-circular inspiral. We then, in Sec. III, use numerical
methods to explore near-horizon inspiral more generally,
showing that the signal is stable to small eccentricity and
that its basic features survive the introduction of modest

inclination.
In Sec. IV we consider detectability with
current and planned detectors, and Sec. V provides some
concluding thoughts.

II. THE SMOKING GUN

We consider a body of mass µ (cid:28) M (modeled as a
point particle) on a prograde,1 circular, equatorial orbit
of a Kerr black hole of mass M and angular momentum
J = aM . The particle’s energy and angular frequency
are given in terms of its Boyer-Lindquist (BL) coordinate
radius r0 by [21]

A. Near-Horizon Inspiral

For near-horizon, near-extremal physics it is conve-

nient to introduce dimensionless quantities

where r is the BL coordinate radius and r+ = M +
M 2 − a2 is the horizon radius.
Substituting into
Eq. (4) and expanding, we see that to leading order in 
the ISCO is located at

xISCO = 21/32/3,

(7)

and hence is in the near-horizon region of a near-extremal
black hole. We will consider a body orbiting outside the
ISCO but still in the near-horizon region, i.e.,

 (cid:28) 1,

xISCO < x0 (cid:28) 1.

(More precisely, we let  ∼ λ and x0 ∼ λ2/3 and count
orders in λ.) Truncating at subleading order, the orbital

Note that 1/(2M ) is the horizon frequency of an extremal
Kerr black hole. In Ref. [22] it was shown that to lead-
ing order such a particle radiates energy in gravitational
waves at the rate

PGW = (C∞ + CH )x0,

(11)

where C∞ > 0 and CH < 0 are dimensionless constants
given approximately by2

C∞ = 0.987(µ/M )2, CH = −0.133(µ/M )2.

(12)

These constants give the rate at which energy is radiated
to inﬁnity and the horizon, respectively, with the minus
sign indicating that energy is being extracted from the
black hole. The energy loss rate translates into an orbital
decay rate via dE/dt = −PGW. Diﬀerentiating (9) with
respect to x0 and combining with (11) gives a diﬀerential
equation for the evolution of the orbital radius

In the above derivation we have retained only leading-

We have used the instantaneous energy balance rela-
tion dE/dt = −PGW, which is only valid if the inspiral is
evolving adiabatically, i.e., if the orbital timescale 1/Ωϕ
is much shorter than the inspiral timescale |x0/(dx0/dt)|.
From (13) and (3) we see that this happens provided

Since µ/M is small by assumption (and can be at least as
small as 10−9 astrophysically), the inspiral is adiabatic
until very close to the ISCO (where the right-hand side
vanishes).

We solve Eq. (13) exactly below, but for illustration
purposes it is useful to consider the case where the par-
ticle has entered the near-horizon regime but is still far

this analysis. To obtain the numbers in (12) required keeping up

(14)

To estimate the length of time spent in the pre-ISCO

inspiral we return to Eq. (13), whose exact solution is

x0(t) = X0e−t/τ g(t),

(19)

where we have chosen x0(0) = X0 and deﬁned

3
from the ISCO, i.e., xISCO (cid:28) x0 (cid:28) 1. In this case the
term 22/x3
0 = (xISCO/x0)3 in (13) is negligible and the
equation is trivially solved by

x0(t) = X0e−t/τ .

(16)

where X0 = x0(0) is the position at the (somewhat arbi-
trary) point where we declare the beginning of the near-
horizon phase of inspiral. From Eq. (11) the radiated
ﬂux is proportional to the particle’s radius and thus the
power measured in the gravitational wave detector will
drop oﬀ exponentially,

Pdetector ∼ e−t/τ .

(17)

Furthermore, from (10) the orbital frequency will in-
crease towards the extremal horizon frequency ΩH =
1/(2M ) as time increases. The characteristic frequency
of the waveform is then twice this frequency (owing to
the spin-2 nature of gravitation),

fdetector ∼ 2 × ΩH /2π =

Eqs. (17) and (18) are our basic smoking gun.

Here W (x) is the Lambert W (or product log) function,
deﬁned for x ≥ −1/e so that W (0) = 0 and W (−1/e) =

of the Lambert function reaches its limit −1/e, which
occurs at

tNHI =

τ

(k − 1 − log k).

(22)

Here NHI is for “near-horizon inspiral”; tNHI is the length
of BL time spent in adiabatic inspiral after the particle
arrives at X0, the (somewhat arbitrary) beginning of the
near-horizon region. This is also the length of the signal
seen by the detector at inﬁnity. It should therefore be
possible to measure the black hole spin  from the length
of the signal. Notice that tNHI diverges logarithmically
as  → 0. This is consistent with the precisely extremal

case  = 0,3 where there is no ISCO and the inspiral
phase lasts for inﬁnite observer time.

C. Consistency of near-horizon inspiral

The gravitational waves emitted by the particle during
inspiral will change the mass and spin of the black hole.
The change in mass is given by dM/dt = CH x0 (which is
negative—energy is extracted), and the change in angu-
lar momentum is given by dJ/dt = (dM/dt)/Ωϕ. (This
latter relationship holds for any quasi-circular inspiral.)
The associated change in  is given by

(23)

To ﬁnd the total change over the inspiral, one should
plug in the trajectory x0(t) [Eq. (19)] and integrate from
t = 0 to t = tNHI [Eq. (22)]. We can do so analytically if
we keep to leading order in xISCO/x0 = k1/3, using x0 =
X0e−t/τ and tNHI = −(τ /3) log k instead of the exact
expressions. This approximation lengthens the inspiral
and makes more of it take place at larger radii where
d/dt [Eq. (23)] is larger. Thus the calculation produces
an upper bound on the actual change in , which we ﬁnd
to be

∆total < 0.046

For a bound independent of the initial (near-extremal)

III. COMPLETING THE PICTURE

Thus far we have restricted to circular, equatorial in-
spiral in the near-horizon region, where analytic expres-
sions are available [22]. To explore near-extremal inspiral
more generally we turn to numerics. In [22] a new code
was presented that is capable of working very near ex-
tremality. We also make several improvements to the
code of [23, 24] that extend its reach toward extremal-
ity. The numerical values of the ﬂux used in this section
are computed using these two codes. Once the ﬂux is
known we use the formulae in [25–28] to compute the
corresponding inspirals and their associated waveforms.

circular, equatorial orbit of a near-extreme Kerr black hole
with a/M = 1− 10−9 ( = 4× 10−5). The radius of the ISCO
is marked at xISCO (cid:39) 1.6 × 10−3.

A. Full Quasi-Circular Inspiral

We have numerically computed the ﬂux for stable, cir-
cular, equatorial orbits about a near-extreme black hole
over the entire range of orbital radii – see Fig. 2 for an
example.4 The ﬂux peaks around x0 (cid:39) 0.5 and decays
rapidly away from this value. As a check on our numeri-
cal results we compare with analytic approximations near
the horizon [Eq. (11)] and near inﬁnity (using the leading
post-Newtonian term PGW = 32/5(x0+1)−5), ﬁnding the
expected agreement. In Fig. 2 we also show the contri-
bution from just the (l, m) = (2, 2) mode. In contrast to
the situation at large radii where this mode dominates,
in the near-horizon regime it accounts for only ∼ 10% of
the total ﬂux. Correspondingly, we require a large num-
ber of (cid:96)-modes for the total ﬂux to converge in this region
(approximately 30 for three-digit accuracy), compared to
just a few at larger radii.

We use these ﬂuxes to build a complete adiabatic in-
spiral, beginning a modest distance away and proceed-
ing through the near-horizon region to the ISCO. The
orbital frequency is seen to monotonically increase, and
the orbital radius to monotonically decrease, eventually
approaching the horizon values exponentially in time,
conﬁrming the analytic prediction – see Fig. 3(a). The
associated waveform when the binary is viewed face on
is depicted in Fig. 1. Notice that the maximum power
is oﬀset from the maximum amplitude, another unique
feature that occurs because the frequency continues to
rapidly increase even as the amplitude decreases. When
the binary is viewed edge on the waveform exhibits pro-
nounced relativistic beaming in the near-horizon region
– see Fig. 3(b). This is to be expected as the relevant

3 The ﬂux in the extremal case [17] is identical to the ﬂux under
the conditions considered here (8), making the extremal signal
identical to what we derive here. This agreement is highly non-
trivial and not well-understood [22].

4 As long as we are outside the ISCO the precise value of near-
extremal spin makes little diﬀerence to the ﬂux at ﬁxed BL ra-
dius.

limit x0 ∼ 2/3 → 0 is ultra-relativistic, with the circu-
lar orbit approaching the null generators of the extremal
horizon [29]. Similar snapshot waveforms were computed
by Detweiler [30].

We can use the numerical computations to select an ap-
propriate choice of X0, the boundary of the near-horizon
region. From Fig. (2), an appropriate choice is X0 = 0.1,
where the numerical expressions begin to diverge from
the analytical expressions. Using Eqs. (22) and (21), this
translates into a bound  < 0.003 or a > 0.999995M for
seeing a full timescale τ of exponentially decaying wave-
form. However, it is clear from Fig. 3 that the distinc-
tive amplitude decay starts well before the exponential
portion sets in, so a more appropriate choice might be
X0 = 0.3, where the ﬂux begins to decrease with de-
creasing radius. If we still apply (22), this corresponds
to the bound  < .016 or a > 0.9999M for seeing a full
timescale of amplitude decrease. This is consistent with
our numerical experiments, and we have quoted this value
in the introduction.

The most likely astrophysical scenario for the forma-
tion of a near-horizon, quasi-circular binary is that the
orbiting body inspiraled from a much larger distance via
gravitational-wave emission. Some of these waves will be
absorbed by the black hole and change its mass and spin.
If there is no other source of angular momentum spinning
up the black hole, then this places a bound on how ex-
tremal the black hole can be by the time the body reaches
the near-horizon region. Repeating the analysis of [31]
for our quasi-circular inspiral, we ﬁnd that an initially ex-
tremal black hole will have a spin of a/M = 1−0.043µ/M
by the time the compact object enters the near-horizon
regime. We require a ≥ 0.9999M in order for the near-
horizon waveform to be observed for one timescale, trans-
lating to a restriction µ/M < 2× 10−3 on the mass ratio.
This is no restriction for eLISA sources, but creates some
tension for LIGO inspirals. We emphasize, however, that

our results for the near-horizon portion are agnostic as
to the formation scenario. We leave it to nature—and
observation—to determine whether near-horizon, near-
extremal binaries exist at any given mass ratio.

B. More General Inspirals

Fully generic orbits can be characterized by three or-
bital parameters: the eccentricity e, semi-latus rectum p,
and inclination θinc. We use the deﬁnitions of [27]. While
we leave the fully generic case for future work, we take
the opportunity to point out a number of interesting fea-
tures of eccentricity and inclination in the near-extreme
case.

First, we consider spherical orbits [32], which have a
constant coordinate radius x0 and librate in θ about the
equatorial plane up to some maximum value θinc. An
inspiral which is initially spherical will remain spherical
throughout the entire evolution [25] and such inspirals
have been studied at non-extreme values of spin [26]. In
the near-extremal case, there are stable orbits in the near-
horizon region provided θinc (cid:46) 25◦. In such an inspiral, as
the radius of the orbit approaches the horizon, the polar
libration frequency Ωθ (deﬁned relative to BL time t) ap-
proaches zero, while the orbital frequency Ωϕ approaches
the horizon frequency. Fig. 4 shows this behavior in a
numerically computed inspiral along with the associated
gravitational waveform as an inset. In the near-horizon
regime the waveform exhibits a decaying envelope sim-
ilar to the equatorial case with the addition of modu-
lations relating the polar libration of the inspiral. As
the particle approaches the horizon the polar frequency
tends to zero and the associated modulations in the wave-
form lengthen. When the initial inclination is small (not
shown), the waveform closely matches the corresponding
quasi-circular inspiral.

FIG. 4. Evolution of the polar and azimuthal orbital frequen-
cies of an inclined (spherical) inspiral into a near-extremal
Kerr black hole with 1 − a/M = 10−9. The evolution begins
at t = 0 when r0 = 3M and θinc = 15◦. The inset shows the
near-horizon portion of the associated face-on waveform with
a decaying envelope modulated by the polar librations of the
inspiral.

Eccentric inspirals present a numerical challenge be-
cause of the large number of radial harmonics required
for each (cid:96), m mode in the near-horizon regime. For this
reason we restrict ourselves to exploring low eccentricity
inspirals, leaving the more generic case for future work.
Our numerical results demonstrate the following. First,
the quasi-circular inspiral is stable to the introduction
of small eccentricity for at least the ﬁrst few timescales.
In particular, the radial motion of the eccentric inspiral
closely tracks the orbital radius of a quasi-circular inspi-
ral – see Fig. 5. After a few timescales the eccentricity
has typically evolved to become of order the orbital ra-
dius (one naive measure of the breakdown of circularity),
but we ﬁnd that snapshot waveforms still remain visually
close, suggesting the circular orbit is still a good approx-
imation. The waveform envelope still displays the char-
acteristic amplitude decrease, and is especially similar to
the circular case near the end.

Second, the orbital eccentricity decreases for nearly the
entire inspiral. This is in contrast to the non-extremal
case, where the eccentricity decreases for most of the evo-
lution before increasing as the separatrix (the analog of
the ISCO) is approached [33]. In our near-extreme inspi-
ral we observe only a tiny uptick very near the separatrix.
This behavior is inline with the predictions and observa-
tions of Ref. [28].

Third, we note an unusual feature of highly eccentric
inspirals in the near-extremal case: inverted zoom-whirl
behavior. In any inspiral, orbits near the separatrix dis-
play a zoom-whirl character [28], with each orbital period
containing a number of “whirls” near an unstable circu-
lar orbit and a “zoom” out to large radii. Normally the
whirl phase of the waveform is louder, but in the near-
extremal case the whirling occurs in the near-horizon re-
gion and the amplitude is accordingly suppressed. The

FIG. 5. Evolution of a low eccentricity, equatorial inspi-
ral in the near-horizon regime of a Kerr black hole with
a/M = 1 − 10−9 (blue curve).
Initially the orbital eccen-
tricity and semi-latus rectum are e0 = 0.01 and p0 = 1.2M ,
respectively. The eccentric inspiral closely tracks a circular,
equatorial inspiral (red curve) that starts with an initial ra-
dius of r0 = p0. The inset shows the waveform associated
with the eccentric inspiral which has the characteristic expo-
nentially decaying envelope modulated by the radial librations
of the inspiral.

zoom takes the particle out of the near-horizon region.
Thus the zoom and whirl phases are “inverted”, with the
zoom phase being of greater amplitude.

IV. DETECTABILITY

The beginning of an inspiral into a near-extremal black
hole, before the body has reached the near-horizon re-
gion,
is almost identical to the corresponding inspiral
into a more modestly spinning black hole (Fig. 1). We
can therefore use standard detectability estimates for this
portion; see, for example, Ref. [34] for discussion relevant
to intermediate mass ratio inspiral measured by LIGO,
and Ref. [35] for recent discussion relevant to eLISA mea-
surements. This analysis suggests that Advanced LIGO
could detect these sources out to a few hundred mega-
parsecs, and eLISA could measure events to a redshift
z ∼ 0.7.

Focusing on near-horizon inspiral, we have performed
a basic analysis of the signal-to-noise assuming that only
this portion is seen (App. A). We ﬁnd that the hori-
zon distances are only modestly changed, which is very
promising for both detectors. However, for LIGO, there
is the potential to confuse the signal with quasi-normal
ringing (QNR) of a more modestly spinning black hole.
QNR is also an exponential decay with frequency set by
the horizon frequency (like NHI), but with the time con-
stant set by the mass and spin of the black hole (see, e.g.,
Ref. [36] for a review) instead of the two masses of the
binary, Eq. (14). For LIGO sources, the NHI timescale
is comparable to QNR timescales of non-extremal black
holes – see the appendix for details. As such, there is

prosaic black hole.

We expect that this concern can be mitigated by tak-
ing into account the inspiral prior to the NHI. The ISCO
of a nearly extremal black hole is likely to be at much
higher frequency than the ISCO of the black hole one in-
fers from the QNR interpretation; see the appendix for an
example. The incommensurate properties of the pre-NHI
inspiral and the NHI interpreted as QNR should signal
that one has not correctly interpreted the system’s last
gravitational waves. Although further work is necessary
to quantify how well LIGO can distinguish a nearly ex-
tremal black hole from that is merely rapidly rotating,
we are optimistic that this can be done.

At the lower frequencies of a space-based detector like
eLISA, there is no confusing NHI with inspiral into a non-
extremal black hole. First, the QNR timescale agrees
with the NHI timescale only when the ringing black hole
is itself near-extremal,5 so both interpretations point to a
rapidly spinning black hole. Second, the QNR timescale
is not the whole story near extremality: recent results
suggest that coherent superposition of modes results in a
1/t decay period before the characteristic exponential de-
cay [37]. Such a decay is not present during NHI. Finally,
the NHI decay spends many orbits in the eLISA band—
indeed it is possible that a source could be in NHI for
the entire eLISA lifetime—oﬀering much more promise
to distinguish the signals using higher harmonics (e.g.,
seeing the relativistic beaming of Fig. 3(b)). For other
source parameters, we could also see the earlier inspiral
and the characteristic transition to near-horizon inspiral.

V. GARGANTUA

The title of our article makes reference to Christopher
Nolan’s science-ﬁction epic Interstellar, which features a
black hole named Gargantua. Thorne [38] estimated that
Gargantua must have a mass of approximately 108M(cid:12)
and a spin of at least J (cid:38) (1 − 10−14)M 2 in order to en-
able key pieces of the ﬁlm’s narrative. This puts Gargan-
tua well within the near-extremal regime studied here.
The associated frequency of a near-horizon inspiral is
10−4 Hz (see Eq. (A10)), which is in-band for eLISA.
If the companion were a sixty solar-mass black hole like
one recently observed [20], the decay timescale would be
12 years (see Eq. (A17)). The associated signal would
therefore be visible for the entire eLISA lifetime. If Gar-
gantua is out there, eLISA just might ﬁnd it.

5 The QNR timescale is proportional to M/ near extremality [37],

requiring  ∼ µ/M to match the NHI timescale (14).

Appendix A: Detectability of Near-Horizon Inspiral

In this appendix, we estimate the distance to which a
gravitational-wave detector can measure a near-horizon
inspiral. We begin with a standard result for the SNR of
a measured gravitational-wave h(t):

(cid:18) S

(cid:19)2

N

(cid:90) ∞

−∞

= 2

|˜h(f )|2
Sh(|f|)

df .

(A1)

The quantity Sh(f ) is the 1-sided spectral density of de-
tector noise, and ˜h(f ) is the Fourier transform of the
waveform h(t). Our goal is not to be comprehensive, but
rather to provide reliable estimates of detectability, ac-
curate to a factor ∼ 2. As such, we will neglect issues
related to the detector antenna pattern, and the location
and orientation of the binary on the sky (all of which
aﬀect our results by factors of order unity). We will also
focus on the simplest case of circular, equatorial inspiral.
Generalizing to more complicated orbits and realistic sky
position and orientation is a substantial task that we de-
fer to later analysis.

For circular and equatorial inspiral, the face-on and
edge-on cases bound the possibilities, so we will examine
them separately. For face-on, the signal is almost entirely
in the l = |m| = 2 mode at frequency fgw = 2 × ΩH/2π,
with functional form

Here, D is the distance to the system, and AFO is the am-
plitude for the face-on case. Since the signal is monochro-
matic, the spectral density of noise can be taken out of
the integral. Invoking Parseval’s theorem, we can then
rewrite the SNR formula (A1) as

The eLISA sensitivity is expected to be approximately
from about 3 ×
ﬂat in its band of peak sensitivity,
10−3 Hz (cid:46) f (cid:46) 10−1 Hz. The strain spectral density
at these frequencies is Sh(f ) (cid:39) 4 × 10−40 Hz−1 (Fig. 12
of Ref. [16], noting that the vertical axis is the square
root of Sh). Most observable harmonics of fH will lie in
this nearly ﬂat band for M ∼ 107 M(cid:12).

Although detailed analysis will be needed to deter-
mine an appropriate threshold SNR, for a monochro-
matic signal lasting ∼ 105 cycles, it is likely to be of
order 15. Let us consider a small body of µ = 10 M(cid:12)
spiraling into a black hole of M = 107 M(cid:12). For this case,
τ = 0.451M 2/µ (cid:39) 0.7 years. Using the amplitudes (A9),

For edge-on, a large number of modes make a signif-

By Eq. (A10), we have fH = 50 Hz if M = 320 M(cid:12). At
this mass, the m = 2 harmonic radiates very close to the
peak sensitivity of Advanced LIGO, where the spectral
density of noise in its ﬁnal conﬁguration is expected to
reach Sh (cid:39) 4 × 10−46 Hz−1. Let us consider a 10 M(cid:12)
black hole spiraling into a 320 M(cid:12) near-extremal black
hole. Repeating6 our analysis for these masses and using

but those beyond A5

fer by ∼ 5%. Note that these amplitudes continue to
decrease as m increases.

6 Note that Eqs. (A4) and (A6) strictly speaking do not apply in
the LIGO case, since τ ΩH is not large. However, we ﬁnd empir-
ically that the error one makes using these formulas is percent
level or smaller.

(Note that we use a lower threshold SNR here, since the
number of cycles in band is smaller — the signal is not
spread out over as many cycles as in the eLISA case.
Note also that the scaling with M is quite rough, and
only approximately accurate over the range 200 M(cid:12) (cid:46)
M (cid:46) 500 M(cid:12). Outside of this range, the signal moves to
frequencies at which the noise deviates signiﬁcantly from
our ﬁducial value.) The values (A14) and (A15) suggest
that it might be possible to see near-extremal black hole
physics with LIGO, given nearly extremal black holes of
a few hundred solar masses.

3. Distinguishing NHI from QNR

The NHI waveform will unfortunately look very similar
to quasi-normal ringing: both are exponentially decaying
sinusoids. As such, one should ask what the consequences
are of confusing NHI for QNR. For the case of detection
by eLISA, we ﬁnd that this confusion is essentially harm-
less: even if we mistake NHI for QNR, we will conclude
that we have observed processes involving a nearly ex-
tremally rotating black hole. For LIGO, this confusion
is not harmless, and would lead us to conclude that we
have observed inspiral into a non-extremal black hole.

To understand the consequences of these two varieties
of confusion, let us examine the exponential decay time
for NHI:

cycles in the m = 2 mode before its amplitude has fallen
by a factor of 1/e. Such a signal would be indistinguish-
able from, and likely be confused with, the quasi-normal
ringing of a much more slowly spinning black hole. Us-
ing the ﬁts given in Ref. [39], we ﬁnd that our ﬁducial
LIGO NHI would be indistinguishable from ringdown for
a black hole with mass M = 240 M(cid:12), spin a/M = 0.95.
We note, however, that the inspiral preceding the NHI
waveform is likely to have properties inconsistent with
such a relatively slowly spinning black hole. For exam-
ple, for a 320 M(cid:12) black hole, the ISCO corresponds to an
m = 2 mode of f = 55 Hz for a/M = 0.95, signiﬁcantly
smaller than the f = 100 Hz value found in the near-
extremal limit. Although further analysis is necessary, it
seems likely that the incommensurate characteristics of
the QNR interpretation of the NHI waves with the pre-
NHI inspiral may allow us to probe near-extremal black
holes with LIGO.

The NHI signal is quite long-lived in the eLISA band.

For our ﬁducial parameters, the signal radiates

cycles in the m = 2 mode before its amplitude falls by
1/e. Even if one attempted to interpret this signal as
quasi-normal ringing, its very slow falloﬀ would lead one
to conclude that the large black hole’s spin is nearly ex-
tremal. For example, if one uses the ﬁts given in [39],
one ﬁnds that our ﬁducial eLISA NHI signal looks like
ringdown for a black hole with spin a/M (cid:39) 1 − 10−10.
In other words, whether we interpret this signal as near
horizon inspiral or as quasi-normal ringing, we conclude
that the black hole is nearly extremal.
