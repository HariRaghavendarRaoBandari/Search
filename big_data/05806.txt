We consider a massive vector ﬁeld with derivative interactions that propagates only the 3 desired
polarizations (besides two tensor polarizations from gravity) with second-order equations of motion
in curved space-time. The cosmological implications of such generalized Proca theories are investi-
gated for both the background and the linear perturbation by taking into account the Lagrangian
up to quintic order.
In the presence of a matter ﬂuid with a temporal component of the vector
ﬁeld, we derive the background equations of motion and show the existence of de Sitter solutions
relevant to the late-time cosmic acceleration. We also obtain conditions for the absence of ghosts
and Laplacian instabilities of tensor, vector, and scalar perturbations in the small-scale limit. Our
results are applied to concrete examples of the general functions in the theory, which encompass
vector Galileons as a speciﬁc case. In such examples, we show that the de Sitter ﬁxed point is always
a stable attractor and study viable parameter spaces in which the no-ghost and stability conditions
are satisﬁed during the cosmic expansion history.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The high-precision observations achieved by the measurements like supernovae Type Ia (SNIa) [1], Cosmic Mi-
crowave Background (CMB) [2], and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) [3] together with the two pillars of General
Relativity (GR) and the cosmological principle have led to a notion of the standard cosmological model. According
to this concordance model, about 70 % and 25 % of the today’s energy density of the Universe correspond to shadowy
components dubbed dark energy and dark matter, respectively. In particular, dark energy has a repulsive force against
gravity, which leads to the late-time cosmic acceleration. After its ﬁrst discovery in 1998, there have been numerous
attempts to pursue the origin of dark energy [4].

The ﬁrst promising explanatory attempt for dark energy consists of introducing a cosmological constant Λ that
would cause an eﬀective repulsive force between cosmological objects at large distances. A natural origin of the
cosmological constant could be the vacuum energy density. Using the technique of particle physics, one can estimate
the expected value for the vacuum energy density caused by ﬂuctuating quantum ﬁelds [5]. The result is the worst
theoretical prediction in the history of physics. The discrepancy between the theoretically predicted value and the
measured one amounts to 120 orders of magnitude. This constitutes the vacuum catastrophe prediction which remains
one of the most challenging puzzles in physics.

An alternative explanation for the late-time acceleration of the Universe could be accounted by introducing new
dynamical degrees of freedom. This is achieved either by directly invoking new ﬂuids in form of an energy-momentum
tensor Tµν with negative pressure or by modifying the geometrical part of Einstein ﬁeld equations (see Refs. [6]
for reviews). One hope in weakening gravity on cosmological scales is to tackle the cosmological constant problem.
The implications are multifaceted. The same modiﬁcation might account for the late-time speed-up of the cosmic
expansion. This type of scenarios can naturally arise in higher-dimensional theories or massive gravity.

Concerning the higher-dimensional frameworks, the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model is one of the most
important large-scale modiﬁcations of gravity [7]. The Universe is modeled by a conﬁned three-brane embedded
in a ﬁve-dimensional Minkowski bulk. An intrinsic Einstein-Hilbert term is introduced to recover four-dimensional
gravity on small scales. On the other hand, the gravity is systematically weakened on cosmological scales due to the
gravitational leakage to the extra dimension. From the eﬀective four dimensional point of view, the graviton acquires
a soft mass and hence carries ﬁve degrees of freedom. One of such degrees of freedom corresponds to the helicity-0
mode, which sources the existence of a self-accelerating solution.

The non-linear interactions of the helicity-0 mode make the mode decouple from the gravitational dynamics, which
is known as the Vainshtein mechanism [8]. Motivated by the nice properties of the helicity-0 mode in the decoupling

2

limit of the DGP model, more general “Galileon” interactions have been proposed on the Minkowski background [9].
These interactions are invariant under internal Galilean and shift transformations. The Galilean symmetries together
with the requirement of ghost absence restrict the eﬀective Lagrangian to consist only of ﬁve derivative interactions.
There were attempts to generalize the Minkowski Galileon theory to a curved background. The ﬁrst natural
pursuit was done by covariantizing directly the decoupling limit [10]. A rigorous investigation revealed that the naive
covariantization (replacing partial derivatives with covariant derivatives) would yield higher-order equations of motion
and that unique non-minimal couplings with the curvature should be added to maintain the equations of motion up
to second order [11]. The generalization of this latter “covariant Galileon” led to the rediscovery of the Horndeski
action [12] as the most general scalar-tensor theories with second-order equations of motion in 4-dimensions [13]. The
application of covariant Galileons to cosmology witnessed a ﬂurry of investigations concerning self-accelerating de Sitter
solutions [14], late-time cosmology and its observational implications [15, 16], inﬂation [17–19], super-luminalities [20],
and so on.

Even if the ghost-like Ostrogradski instability [21] can be avoided for covariant Galileons, the Galilean symmetry is
explicitly broken when promoted to the curved space-time. However, there have been also successful generalizations
to maximally symmetric backgrounds with a generalized Galilean symmetry [22]. It is worth mentioning that there
exists a parallel to massive gravity, namely Galileon interactions arise naturally in the decoupling limit of massive
gravity [23]. Furthermore, the covariantization of the decoupling-limit interactions gives rise to a speciﬁc sub-class of
Horndeski theories [24].

A natural follow-up was to apply the same construction of Galileon-like interactions to arbitrary p-forms [25]. While
even p-form Galileons and multi odd p-form Galileons are easy to construct, very soon it was realized that one cannot
construct Galilean interactions for a Lorentz- and gauge-invariant, single spin-1 (i.e., 1-form) ﬁeld in any dimensions
[26] (see also Refs. [27–29]). The formalism developed for the proof of the no-go theorem was recently extended
towards categorization of all possible general odd p-form Galileons, as an application of the concept called plethysm
in the representation theory of the symmetric groups [30]. However, this no-go theorem does not apply to massive spin
1 ﬁelds since one of the assumptions of the theorem, the gauge invariance, is dropped, and it is possible to successfully
construct derivative self-interactions for the vector ﬁeld with a broken U (1) symmetry. A systematical construction
of these interactions with only 3 propagating degrees of freedom (two transverse and one longitudinal) was performed
in Ref. [31] with the requirement that the longitudinal mode possesses non-trivial interactions belonging to the class
of Galileon/Horndeski theories. The analysis was based on studying the Hessian matrix and assuring the propagation
of a second class constraint.

The action derived in Ref. [31] corresponds to the generalization of massive Proca theories to the curved background
in which the requirement of second-order equations of motion enforces the presence of non-minimal derivative couplings
with the Ricci scalar and the Einstein tensor [31, 32] (see also Refs. [33–36] for related works). Note that similar
type of vector-tensor theories can naturally arise in modiﬁcations of gravity based on Weyl geometries [37]. It is also
possible to obtain derivative interactions higher than quintic order by keeping the degrees of freedom three [38, 39].
In a sub-class of generalized Proca theories up to the quartic Lagrangian L4, the existence of de Sitter solutions
relevant to dark energy was found in Refs. [32]. Applying these theories to the spherically symmetric background,
the authors in Ref. [40] showed that cubic-order derivative self-interactions and non-minimal derivative couplings at
quartic order can eﬃciently screen the propagation of the ﬁfth force in local regions of the Universe. In this paper, we
will closely study cosmological implications of the full derivative interactions introduced in Ref. [31] in the presence
of matter (radiation and non-relativistic matter). In particular, we derive conditions for the absence of ghosts and
Laplacian instabilities by considering tensor, vector, and scalar perturbations at linear level. Our general results will
be applied to concrete models relevant to the late-time cosmic acceleration. Not only we show the existence of stable
de Sitter solutions, but also we study the stability of perturbations throughout the cosmological evolution.

Our paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we present the background equations of motion in the presence of a
temporal component of the vector ﬁeld and a matter ﬂuid. In Sec. III we derive conditions for avoiding ghosts and
Laplacian instabilities by expanding the generalized Proca action up to quadratic order in tensor, vector, and scalar
perturbations. In Sec. IV we discuss general conditions for the theoretical consistency at the de Sitter ﬁxed point and
in the early cosmological epoch. In Sec. V we propose a class of concrete models in which the de Sitter point is always
a late-time attractor and discuss the viable parameter space in which ghosts and instabilities are absent during the
cosmic expansion history. Sec. VI is devoted to conclusions.

II. GENERALIZED PROCA THEORIES AND THE BACKGROUND EQUATIONS OF MOTION

Let us start with generalized Proca theories described by the four-dimensional action [31]

S =Z d4x√−g (L + LM ) ,

L = LF +

Xi=2

where g is a determinant of the metric tensor gµν, LM is a matter Lagrangian, and

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)
(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

Here, Aµ is a vector ﬁeld with Fµν = ∇µAν − ∇ν Aµ, ∇µ is the covariant derivative operator, R is the Ricci scalar,
Gµν is the Einstein tensor, c2, d2 are constants, G2,3,4,5 are arbitrary functions of

X = −

1
2

AµAµ ,

(2.7)

and Gi,X = ∂Gi/∂X. The Lagrangians L2,3,4,5 are constructed to keep the propagating degrees of freedom up to three
with second-order equations of motion. As in standard massless Maxwell theory, there are two transverse polarizations
for the vector ﬁeld. The Proca theory corresponds to the function G2(X) = m2X with G3,4,5 = 0, in which case
introduction of the mass term m breaks the U (1) gauge symmetry. This gives rise to one additional degree of freedom
in the longitudinal direction.

The generalized Proca theories given above correspond to the extension of massive Proca theories with the cubic
derivative self-interaction L3 and non-minimal derivative couplings with the Ricci scalar (in the Lagrangian L4) and
with the Einstein tensor (in the Lagrangian L5). In Eqs. (2.5) and (2.6) the terms multiplied by the constants c2 and
d2 can be expressed in terms of Fµν [31, 38], so they can be regarded as intrinsic vector modes (i.e., they vanish by
taking the scalar limit Aµ → ∇µπ). In Refs. [32] the cosmology for c2 = −1 up to the Lagrangian L4 was studied for
speciﬁc choices of the functions G2,3,4. In this paper we study the cosmology for the full action (2.1) for arbitrary
constants c2 and d2. We also derive the background equations of motion and the no-ghost/stability conditions without
specifying the functional forms of G2,3,4,5.

We deﬁne the energy-momentum tensor of the matter Lagrangian LM , as

T (M)
µν = −

2

√−g

δ(√−gLM )

.

δgµν

Assuming that matter is minimally coupled to gravity, the following continuity equation holds

∇µT (M)

µν = 0 .

(2.8)

(2.9)

We derive the equations of motion on the ﬂat Friedmann-Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background described
by the line element ds2 = −dt2 + a2(t)δij dxidxj , where a(t) is the scale factor that depends on the cosmic time t.
The homogenous vector ﬁeld Aµ, which does not break spatial isotropy, is given by

Aµ = (φ(t), 0, 0, 0) ,

(2.10)

where the temporal component φ is a function of t. Then, the kinetic term (2.7) reduces to X = φ2/2.
For the matter Lagrangian LM , we take into account the perfect ﬂuid with the energy-momentum tensor T µ

ν =
diag(−ρM , PM , PM , PM ), where ρM is the energy density and PM is the pressure. Then, the continuity equation (2.9)
reads

˙ρM + 3H(ρM + PM ) = 0 ,

(2.11)

where a dot represents a derivative with respect to t, and H ≡ ˙a/a is the Hubble expansion rate.

Varying the action (2.1) with respect to gµν, we obtain the following equations of motion

G2 − G2,X φ2 − 3G3,X Hφ3 + 6G4H 2 − 6(2G4,X + G4,XX φ2)H 2φ2 + G5,XX H 3φ5 + 5G5,XH 3φ3 = ρM , (2.12)
G2 − ˙φφ2G3,X + 2G4 (3H 2 + 2 ˙H) − 2G4,Xφ (3H 2φ + 2H ˙φ + 2 ˙Hφ) − 4G4,XX H ˙φφ3
+ G5,XX H 2 ˙φφ4 + G5,X Hφ2(2 ˙Hφ + 2H 2φ + 3H ˙φ) = −PM .

(2.13)

Variation of the action (2.1) with respect to Aµ leads to

4

φ(cid:0)G2,X + 3G3,XHφ + 6G4,X H 2 + 6G4,XX H 2φ2 − 3G5,X H 3φ − G5,XX H 3φ3(cid:1) = 0 .

Among four Eqs. (2.11)-(2.14), three of them are independent. We note that Eqs. (2.12) and (2.14) do not contain
any time derivatives of φ. This reﬂects the fact that the theory given by the action (2.1) has been constructed to
avoid the appearance of the propagating degrees of freedom more than three.

(2.14)

From Eq. (2.14) there are two branches of solutions. One of them is φ = 0, but in this case the temporal component

of the vector ﬁeld does not contribute to the background dynamics. Another branch corresponds to
G2,X + 3G3,X Hφ + 6G4,X H 2 + 6G4,XX H 2φ2 − 3G5,X H 3φ − G5,XX H 3φ3 = 0 ,

(2.15)

in which case the ﬁeld φ is directly related to the Hubble parameter H. This allows the existence of de-Sitter
solutions characterized by constant H and φ, so we shall focus on the second branch satisfying Eq. (2.15) in the
following discussion.

III. CONDITIONS FOR AVOIDING GHOSTS AND INSTABILITIES

We derive conditions for the absence of ghosts and instabilities of tensor, vector, and scalar perturbations on the
ﬂat FLRW background. We consider two scalar metric perturbations α, χ and one vector perturbation Vi by choosing
the so-called ﬂat gauge. Under this choice, the temporal and spatial components of gauge transformation vectors are
ﬁxed. Taking into account the tensor perturbation hij, the linearly perturbed line-element is given by [41–43]

where Vi and hij satisfy the following conditions

ds2 = −(1 + 2α) dt2 + 2 (∂iχ + Vi) dt dxi + a2(t) (δij + hij) dxidxj ,

∂iVi = 0 ,
∂ihij = 0 ,

hi

i = 0 .

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

As for the Proca vector ﬁeld Aµ, the time component A0 and the spatial vector Ai can be expressed in the following

forms

A0 = φ(t) + δφ ,

Ai =

1
a2 δij (∂jχV + Ej) ,

(3.4)

(3.5)

where δφ is the perturbation in A0 (which depends on both t and xi). The perturbation χV corresponds to the
intrinsic scalar part, whereas Ej is the vector part satisfying the transverse condition

For the matter action SM =R d4x√−g LM , we consider a single perfect ﬂuid with the energy density ρM . For the

description of the perfect ﬂuid, we make use of the Schutz-Sorkin action [44] (see also Ref. [45]):

∂jEj = 0 .

(3.6)

SM = −Z d4x(cid:2)√−g ρM (n) + J µ(∂µℓ + A1∂µB1 + A2∂µB2)(cid:3) ,

(3.7)

where ℓ is a scalar, J µ is a vector ﬁeld of weight one, A1,A2,B1,B2 are scalars whose perturbations are meant to
describe the vector modes, and n is the number density of the ﬂuid deﬁned by

n =s J αJ βgαβ

g

.

(3.8)

Due to the transverse condition for the vector modes, a third component A3∂µB3 is redundant in the action (3.7).

We express ℓ and J µ into the background and perturbed components, as [45, 46]

5

ρM,n dt′ − ρM,n v ,

ℓ = −Z t
J 0 = N0 + δJ ,
J i =

1
a2 δik (∂kδj + Wk) ,

(3.9)

(3.10)

(3.11)

where ρM,n ≡ ∂ρM /∂n is evaluated on the background, N0 = n0a3 is a constant associated with the total number
of ﬂuid particles (n0 is the background value of n), and v, δJ are the perturbations of ℓ, J 0, respectively. On the
M = R d4x√−g (n0ρM,n − ρM ). Since the term inside the bracket
FLRW background, the action (3.7) reduces to S(0)
corresponds to the pressure PM of the ﬂuid, we have

The perturbation δj corresponds to the scalar part of J i, whereas the intrinsic vector perturbation Wk obeys

PM = n0ρM,n − ρM .

(3.12)

∂kWk = 0 .

We write the perturbation of Ai in the form

where ui corresponds to the intrinsic vector part of the four velocity uα = J α/(n√−g), satisfying

δAi = ρM,n ui ,

∂iui = 0 .

(3.13)

(3.14)

(3.15)

It should be pointed out that the above form of action is not the only possibility for describing the perfect ﬂuid, e.g.,
the k-essence form [47] is also another possibility. However, in the theories under consideration, the Schutz-Sorkin
action is convenient for properly accommodating vector perturbations. Moreover, it provides a natural and convenient
choice of variables for the dust-ﬂuid perturbation with a vanishing propagation speed squared c2
m. On the other hand,
in the k-essence form, one may need to perform a change of variables corresponding to a canonical transformation,
e.g., from the perturbation of the scalar ﬁeld to the density contrast, before taking the c2

m → 0 limit [46].

T > 0.

B. Vector perturbations

6

The four quantities Vi, Ei, Wi, and ui obey the transverse conditions (3.2), (3.6), (3.13), and (3.15), respectively.
For the practical computations of the second-order action, we can consider the vector ﬁelds depending on t and z
alone, e.g., Vi = (V1(t, z), V2(t, z), 0). Then, the transverse condition such as Eq. (3.2) is automatically satisﬁed. For
the quantities Ai and Bi, the simplest choice containing all the needed information of the vector mode is given by
A1 = δA1(t, z), A2 = δA2(t, z), B1 = x + δB1(t, z), and B2 = y + δB2(t, z) [45]. The normalizations of B1 and B2
have been done such that both B1,x and B2,y are equivalent to 1. Note that the above prescription can be extended
to the general case in which the perturbations depend on t, x, y, z.

After expanding the matter action (3.7) up to second order in vector perturbations, it follows that

(3.19)
Since the quantities Wi, δAi, δBi appear only in the matter action, we can vary the action (3.19) with respect to these
perturbations independently of the full second-order action. Variation of Eq. (3.19) in terms of Wi leads to

i (cid:1) + N0(cid:0)2ρM,nViWi − a3ρM V 2

Substituting Eq. (3.20) into Eq. (3.19) and varying the action with respect to δAi, we obtain δAi in the form (3.14)
with

ui = Vi − a2 ˙δBi .

ui = constant ,

(3.21)

(3.22)

which is associated with the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor of the perfect ﬂuid. This is the same
relation as that in GR and it states that the perturbation ui is non-dynamical. Finally, the second-order matter
action reduces to

(3.23)

with the conservation relation (3.22) for the four velocity ui = Vi − a2 ˙δBi.
We sum up the second-order action originating from R d4x√−gL with Eq. (3.23). In doing so, it is convenient to
introduce the following combination

Zi = Ei + φ(t) Vi .

(3.24)

Let us consider the perturbations in Fourier space with k = |k|. Variation of the total second-order action S(2)
respect to Vi leads to

The metric perturbation Vi follows a diﬀerent dynamics from that in GR (where G4,X = 0 = G5,X ). Integrating out
the non-dynamical ﬁelds ui and Vi, we obtain the action for the dynamical ﬁeld Zi. It follows that there are two
dynamical degrees of freedom Z1 and Z2 for the vector mode.

Taking the small-scale limit (k → ∞) in Eq. (3.25) and using the background equations of motion, the resulting

The matrix M is related with the masses of two scalar modes, which do not contain the k2/a2 term. In the following
we shall take the small-scale limit (k → ∞), in which the second term on the r.h.s. of Eq. (3.38) dominates over the
third and fourth terms.
The matrix K is associated with the kinetic terms of two scalar modes. Provided that the two eigenvalues of K are
positive, the scalar ghosts are absent. The no-ghost condition for the matter perturbation δρM is trivially satisﬁed
for ρM + PM > 0. For the perturbation ψ, the quantity related with the no-ghost condition corresponds to1

If the numerator of Eq. (3.44) is positive, then the Laplacian instability of scalar perturbations is absent under the
three no-ghost conditions qT > 0, qV > 0, and qS > 0.

While we have focused on the single-ﬂuid case, the results given in Eqs. (3.40) and (3.44) are valid for the multi-ﬂuid
case by dealing with ρM and PM as the energy density and the pressure of the total ﬂuid, respectively. This situation
is analogous to what happens in scalar Horndeski theories [49]. In summary, besides the matter ﬂuid, the number of
propagating degrees of freedom is ﬁve (two tensors, two vectors, one scalar), where three of them (two vectors and
one scalar) originate from the massive vector ﬁeld. The six quantities qT , qV , qS and c2
S need to be positive to
avoid the appearance of ghosts and instabilities for tensor, vector, scalar perturbations.

IV. GENERAL DISCUSSIONS FOR DE SITTER AND EARLY-UNIVERSE STABILITIES

We discuss no-ghost and stability conditions derived in Sec. III in the two stages: (i) de Sitter ﬁxed point, and (ii)
early cosmological epochs (radiation/matter eras). The functional forms of G2,3,4,5 are not speciﬁed in this section.

A. de Sitter ﬁxed point

The de Sitter solutions, which are characterized by ˙φ = 0 and ˙H = 0, can exist for the branch satisfying Eq. (2.15).
We can solve Eqs. (2.12) and (2.15) to express G4,X and G4,XX in terms of other quantities like G2. Since ρM = 0
at the de Sitter solution, the quantities qT and c2

T reduce, respectively, to

qT = −

c2
T =

.

(4.1)

Provided that G4 > 0, the tensor ghost and instability are absent for qT > 0, i.e.,

(4.2)
In the absence of the Lagrangian L5 (i.e., G5 = 0), the condition (4.2) simply reduces to G2 < 0. This sign is
opposite to that of standard Proca theories characterized by the function G2 = m2X. Naively one may think that
this gives rise to tachyons, but we need to caution that the eﬀective mass mV of the vector ﬁeld in the presence of
gravity is generally diﬀerent from its bare mass.

G2 − H 3φ3G5,X < 0 .

The stability condition for super-horizon modes could be a subtle issue since the expression for the squared mass
depends on e.g., normalization of variables. So far, we have deﬁned the variables Ei and Vi in the comoving coordinate
basis dxi. Alternatively, one could deﬁne the variables ˜Ei and ˜Vi in the background tetrad basis a(t)dxi since it is the
tetrad components rather than the comoving coordinate components that are relevant for local nonlinear interactions.
The new set of variables is related to the original set of variables as Ei = a ˜Ei and Vi = a ˜Vi, and thus the new variables
may stay constant or decay even if the original variables grow exponentially. In terms of the new variable ˜Ei, the
quadratic action for the vector perturbations around de Sitter backgrounds is simply given by

(4.3)

This expression holds for all k (i.e., without the need for taking the limit k → ∞). Since the eﬀective mass squared
m2
V = 2H 2 of the vector mode is positive, this implies the absence of tachyonic instability on the de Sitter solution.
For m of the order of the today’s Hubble parameter H0, the vector mass term does not aﬀect the dynamics of
perturbations deep inside the Hubble radius (k/a ≫ H) even in the early cosmological epoch.

theories with G2 < 0 to ensure the stability of tensor perturbations in the limit G5 → 0.

If the Lagrangian L5 is present, it is possible to satisfy the condition (4.2) even for G2 > 0. In this case, however,
T are negative for G5 → 0, so the ghost and the instability arise in this limit. We shall focus on the

(4.5)

For the theories and backgrounds with d2HφG5,X > 0, it follows that c2
qT > 0 and qV > 0. For d2HφG5,X < 0, the condition for avoiding the Laplacian instability corresponds to

V > 1 under the two no-ghost conditions

18H 4φ2qT (qV + d2HφG5,X ) + (G2 + 6H 2G4 − H 3φ3G5,X )2 > 0 .

(4.6)

For scalar perturbations, all the terms with the time-derivatives in Eq. (3.44) vanish at the de Sitter solution. Then
c2
S can be simply written as c2
S = [(w1 − 2w2)φw6 + w1w2][(w1 − 2w2)(φw6 + Hw3) + w1w2]/∆. By using the functions
G2,3,4,5 and their derivatives, Eqs. (3.41) and (3.44) reduce, respectively, to

we assume that the early cosmological evolution is close to that of GR with the function G4 = M 2

+ ˙φφ4H 2G5,XX + G5,X φ2H(2φ ˙H + 2φH 2 + 3 ˙φH) .

(4.15)

In the early cosmological epoch, the energy density ρDE and the pressure PDE of the “dark” component are sub-
plH 2. It is then natural to consider
plH 2. In this case, the
pl, so the quantities

does not necessarily imply that the terms c2G4,X and d2HφG5,X in qV are much less than 1. If the conditions

In this case, the vector ghost and stability conditions are automatically satisﬁed.

It should be noted that, even if the conditions (4.17) are violated in the early cosmological epoch, one can avoid
V is larger than 1 for d2G5,X (Hφ− ˙φ) > 0. Hence,
the vector ghost for c2G4,X < 0 and d2HφG5,X < 0. In addition, c2
the three conditions in Eq. (4.17) are suﬃcient but not necessary, so there are other cases in which both qV and c2
V
are positive.

The quantities qS and c2

S of scalar perturbations contain the third-order derivatives G4,XXX and G5,XXX with
respect to X. These terms do not appear in the background equations of motion. Hence we need to impose some
conditions on such derivatives to derive analytic expression of QS and c2
S. Moreover, unless the functional forms of
G2,3,4,5 are speciﬁed, one cannot extract detailed information for each function due to the complexities of no-ghost
and stability conditions of scalar perturbations. In Sec. V we shall compute the quantities QS and c2
S for concrete
models from the radiation era to the late-time de Sitter solution.

V. APPLICATION TO CONCRETE MODELS

In this section, we search for viable dark energy models in the framework of generalized Proca theories given by
the action (2.1). From Eq. (2.15) the ﬁeld φ depends on the Hubble parameter H. To realize the situation in which
the energy density of φ starts to dominate over the background matter densities at the late cosmological epoch, the
amplitude of the ﬁeld φ should grow with the decrease of H. For this purpose, we assume that φ is related with H
according to the relation

φp ∝ H −1 ,

(5.1)

where p is a positive constant. We shall later justify this ansatz by showing that all background equations of motion
are satisﬁed and that all stability conditions for linear perturbations are fulﬁlled. Hereafter, without loss of generality,
we shall focus on the branch in which φ is positive.

For realizing the solution (5.1), the functions G2,3,4,5 in Eq. (2.15) should contain the power-law dependence of X

in the forms

G2(X) = b2X p2 ,

G3(X) = b3X p3 ,

G4(X) =

M 2
pl
2

+ b4X p4 ,

G5(X) = b5X p5 ,

(5.2)

where Mpl is the reduced Planck mass, b2,3,4,5 are constants, and the powers p3,4,5 are given by

p3 =

1
2

(p + 2p2 − 1) ,

p4 = p + p2 ,

p5 =

1
2

(3p + 2p2 − 1) .

(5.3)

The vector Galileon [31, 32] corresponds to the powers p2 = 1 and p = 1, so the ﬁeld φ has the dependence φ ∝ H −1.
Thus the analysis based on the assumption (5.1) is general in that it encompasses the vector Galileon as a speciﬁc
case.

A. Dynamical analysis of the background

Let us ﬁrst consider the background dynamics for the theories given by the functions (5.2) with the powers (5.3).
For the matter sector we take into account non-relativistic matter (energy density ρm and pressure Pm = 0) and
radiation (energy density ρr and pressure Pr = ρr/3), which obey the continuity equations ˙ρm + 3Hρm = 0 and
˙ρr + 4Hρr = 0 respectively. In this case, we have ρM = ρm + ρr and PM = ρr/3 in Eqs. (4.12) and (4.13).

To study the dynamical system of the background, it is convenient to introduce the following density parameters

Ωr ≡

Ωm ≡

βi ≡

pibi

2pi−p2p2b2

(φpH)i−2 ,

where i = 3, 4, 5. Due to the relation (5.1), βi’s are constants. From Eq. (2.15) it follows that

In the following, we employ this relation to express β3 in terms of β4 and β5.

On using Eq. (2.12), we ﬁnd that the dark energy density parameter is related with the quantity y, as

1 + 3β3 + 6(2p + 2p2 − 1)β4 − (3p + 2p2)β5 = 0 .

ΩDE =

βy

(5.5)

(5.6)

(5.7)

(5.8)

Diﬀerentiating Eq. (2.15) with respect to t and using Eq. (2.13), we can solve for ˙φ and ˙H. Taking the derivatives of
ΩDE and Ωr with respect to N ≡ ln a (denoted as a prime), we obtain the following dynamical equations of motion

(5.11)

The matter density parameter Ωm = 1 − ΩDE − Ωr is known by solving Eqs. (5.9) and (5.10) for ΩDE and Ωr,
respectively, with their given initial conditions. We shall prevent ΩDE (or Ωr) from diverging in the interval 0 ≤
ΩDE ≤ 1, by imposing 1 + s > 0.

The eﬀective equation of state of the system, which is deﬁned by weﬀ ≡ −1 − 2 ˙H/(3H 2), reads

weﬀ =

Ωr − 3(1 + s)ΩDE

3(1 + s ΩDE)

.

(5.12)

We deﬁne the dark energy equation of state as wDE ≡ PDE/ρDE, where ρDE and PDE are given by Eqs. (4.14) and
(4.15) respectively. Then, it follows that

wDE = −

3(1 + s) + s Ωr
3(1 + s ΩDE)

.

For the dynamical system given by Eqs. (5.9) and (5.10), there are the following three ﬁxed points:

(a) (ΩDE, Ωr) = (0, 1)
(b) (ΩDE, Ωr) = (0, 0)
(c) (ΩDE, Ωr) = (1, 0)

(radiation point) ,

where C is an integration constant. The constant C can be ﬁxed as Ca4(1+s)

subscript “0” represents the today’s value. Since the ratio between Ωm and Ωr is given by Ωm/Ωr = (a/a0) (Ωm/Ωr)0,
elimination of the scale factor a from Eq. (5.21) leads to

which corresponds to the trajectory of solutions in the (ΩDE, Ωr) plane. For given values of ΩDE0 and Ωr0, the
cosmological trajectory is ﬁxed.

In the radiation-dominated epoch (Ωr ≃ 1), the relation (5.21) shows that, for s > −1, the dark energy density
parameter grows as ΩDE ∝ a4(1+s). In fact, this is consistent with the limits Ωr → 1 and ΩDE ≪ 1 in Eq. (5.9), i.e.,
DE ≃ 4(1 + s)ΩDE. Since ΩDE ∝ y ∝ φ2p2 /H 2, the evolution of φ during the radiation era (H ∝ t−1 and a ∝ t1/2)
Ω′
is given by φ ∝ a2s/p2 . In summary, around the radiation point (a), the dark energy density parameter and the ﬁeld
φ evolve as

ΩDE ∝ t2(p+p2)/p ,

φ ∝ t1/p .

(5.23)

In the matter-dominated epoch (Ωm ≃ 1) the radiation density parameter Ωr decreases as Ωr ∝ a−1, so Eq. (5.21)
implies that the dark energy density parameter evolves as ΩDE ∝ a3(1+s). This relation can be also conﬁrmed by
taking the limits Ωr ≪ 1 and ΩDE ≪ 1 in Eq. (5.9). On using the properties H ∝ t−1 and a ∝ t2/3, it follows that
the time dependence of ΩDE and φ around the matter point (b) is exactly the same as Eq. (5.23).
At the de Sitter point (c), both H and φ are constants. Provided that this ﬁxed point is stable, the solutions with
diﬀerent initial conditions ﬁnally converge to the de Sitter attractor. From Eq. (5.23) we ﬁnd that, in the limit p ≫ 1,
the ﬁeld φ stays nearly constant during the radiation and matter eras, so the cosmological dynamics should be close
to that of the ΛCDM model at the background model. In fact, we have that wDE → −1 in Eqs. (5.17) and (5.18) by
taking the limit p → ∞.
To discuss the stability of the ﬁxed points (a), (b), (c), we consider small perturbations δΩDE and δΩr around
them. These homogeneous perturbations obey

(a) µ1 = 4(1 + s) , µ2 = 1 ,
(b) µ1 = 3(1 + s) , µ2 = −1 ,
(c) µ1 = −3 , µ2 = −4 .

(5.25)
(5.26)
(5.27)

If s > −1, then the radiation ﬁxed point (a) is unstable due to the positivity of µ1 and µ2.

In this case the
matter point (b) corresponds to a saddle. The de Sitter solution (c) is always stable because the two eigenvalues are
negative. Thus, the cosmological trajectory is characterized by the sequence of the ﬁxed points: (a)→(b)→(c). The
dark energy equation of state evolves from wDE = −1 − 4s/3 (radiation era) to wDE = −1 − s (matter era) and then
it ﬁnally approaches the value wDE = −1 at the de Sitter attractor. The same cosmological evolution is realized for
the tracker solution in extended scalar Galileon theories [49]. In this case the second time derivative ¨φ is present in
the background equations of motion, so there are initial conditions where the solutions are not on the tracker. In
generalized vector Galileon theories, the absence of the ¨φ term in Eqs. (2.12)-(2.14) does not allow the deviation from
the tracker solution explained above.

In Fig. 1 we show an example of the phase-map portrait of the dynamical autonomous system for s = 1. One can
see that the de Sitter ﬁxed point (c) is an attractor. All the trajectories with arbitrary initial conditions end there.
The red line denotes the cosmological trajectory following the sequence: (a)→(b)→(c). We would like to remind that

FIG. 1: This ﬁgure illustrates a speciﬁc example of the phase map portrait of the dynamical autonomous system for s = 1.
The radiation ﬁxed point (a) is encoded by the yellow dot, the matter ﬁxed point (b) by green, and the de Sitter ﬁxed point
(c) by blue. The red line corresponds to the cosmological trajectory explained in the main text.

the reason why the zero component of the vector ﬁeld is not part of the dynamical autonomous system comes from
the fact that its equation of motion is an algebraic equation that can be used to determine it fully by H. This will
be always the case as long as Eq. (2.15) does not contain any time derivative applied on φ. Therefore, the dynamical
system is reduced by one dimension. This on the other hand will have as a consequence the known general result that
gravity with auxiliary ﬁelds gives rise to a modiﬁed matter coupling.

In the left panel of Fig. 2, we plot the evolution of wDE versus 1 + z (where z ≡ a0/a − 1 is the redshift) for three
diﬀerent values of s. We identify the present epoch (z = 0) as ΩDE = 0.68 and Ωr = 1 × 10−4. As estimated above,
the dark energy equation of state for s = 1 (case (i) in Fig. 2) evolves as wDE = −7/3 (radiation era) → wDE = −2
(matter era) → wDE = −1 (de Sitter era). This behavior of wDE is the same as that of the tracker solution found
for scalar Galileons [16]. Unfortunately, this case is in tension with the combined observational constraints of SNIa,
CMB, and BAO due to the large deviation of wDE from −1 before the onset of cosmic acceleration [50].
For smaller |s|, the dark energy equation of state in the radiation and matter eras tends to be closer to the value
wDE = −1. In the cases (ii) and (iii) shown in the left panel of Fig. 2, the values of wDE during the matter-dominated
epoch are given, respectively, by wDE = −1.5 and wDE = −1.2. The likelihood analysis based on the SNIa, CMB,
and BAO data in extended scalar Galileon theories has given the bound 0 ≤ s ≤ 0.36 (95 % CL) for tracker solutions
[51], which can be also applied to the present model. Hence the cases (i) and (ii) are in tension with the data, but
the case (iii) is observationally allowed.

In the right panel of Fig. 2, we show the evolution of weﬀ and the density parameters ΩDE, Ωm, Ωr for s = 1/5.
As estimated analytically, the solution repels away from the unstable radiation point (a) (with Ωr = 1, weﬀ = 1/3)
and temporally dwells in the saddle matter point (b) (with Ωm = 1, weﬀ = 0). Finally, the solution approaches the
stable de Sitter attractor (c) characterized by ΩDE = 1, weﬀ = −1.

B. No-ghost and stability conditions

Let us study the no-ghost and stability conditions of tensor, vector, and scalar perturbations for the theories given
by the functions (5.2) with the powers (5.3). In what follows, unless otherwise stated, we shall discuss the case in

FIG. 2: (Left) Evolution of wDE versus 1 + z (where z is the redshift) for the three cases (i) s = 1, (ii) s = 1/2, and (iii) s = 1/5.
In each case the initial conditions are chosen to be (i) ΩDE = 1.0 × 10−42, Ωr = 0.998 at z = 1.7 × 106, (ii) ΩDE = 1.5 × 10−36,

Taking the limit ΩDE → 0 in the radiation and matter dominated epochs, we have qT → M 2

For the theories with β5 = 0 and p2(p+p2) > 0, the conditions (5.31) and (5.32) translate to β < 0 and 1−12p2β4 > 0,
respectively. When β5 = 0, the condition for avoiding the tensor ghost at the de Sitter point requires that G2 < 0, in
which case the constant b2 and the quantity y in Eq. (5.5) are negative. This is consistent with the condition β < 0

2 We note that under the limits G4 → M 2

pl/2 and G5 → 0 in Eqs. (3.17), (3.18), (3.27) and (3.28), it follows that qT → M 2

(5.32) (with β5 = 0).

(5.35)

The quantity qV contains the time-dependent factors ΩDE and u. From Eq. (5.23) it follows that ΩDE grows faster
than u2 for

Under this condition, the term containing ΩDE in Eq. (5.33) tends to be negligible relative to the u2β term as we go
back to the past. In other words, qV is close to 1 in the radiation and deep matter eras. At the de Sitter ﬁxed point,
the absence of the vector ghost requires that

p + p2 > 1 .

In the following we shall focus on the case in which the powers p and p2 satisfy the condition (5.36). Then, c2

approaches 1 in the asymptotic past. At the de Sitter point, the condition for avoiding the instability of vector
perturbations reads

(5.38)

Under the no-ghost condition (5.31) of the tensor mode, the second term on the r.h.s. of Eq. (5.38) is positive. If
d2β5(p + p2)/β ≥ 0 and (qV )dS > 0, then the vector propagation speed is super-luminal.

For scalar perturbations, the quantity (3.41) reduces to

qS = 22−p2M 2(1+p2)

pl

u2p2 p2 (p + p2ΩDE) b2 [−1 + 6(2p + 2p2 − 1)β4 − 2(3p + 2p2)β5] ,

so that the scalar ghost is absent for

p2 (p + p2ΩDE) b2 [−1 + 6(2p + 2p2 − 1)β4 − 2(3p + 2p2)β5] > 0 .

(5.39)

(5.40)

We need to caution that, even when qS > 0, there are cases in which the term w1 − 2w2 appearing in the denominator
of QS crosses 0. Due to the divergence of QS, we shall exclude such cases in the following discussion3. One can
express w1 − 2w2 in the form

w1 − 2w2 = −2HM 2

pl (1 − ΩDEwc) ,

wc ≡ 1 + p + p2 −

p2(p + 1)(p + p2)(2β5p2 − 1)

β

.

(5.41)

For 0 < ΩDE < 1, the term w1 − 2w2 remains negative for wc < 1, i.e.,

p2(p + 1)(2β5p2 − 1)

β

> 1 .

(5.42)

3 The divergence of QS does not necessarily imply theoretical inconsistencies. It may simply indicate an inﬁnite weak coupling, depending

on the nature of non-linear interactions. Nonetheless we do not consider this possibility just to be conservative.

To satisfy this inequality for the theories with β5 = 0 and p2(p + 1) > 0, the necessary condition to be required is
β < 0.

The general expression of cS computed from Eq. (3.44) is cumbersome, but we can obtain its analytic expression

17

in radiation and matter eras by taking the limit ΩDE → 0. This leads to the following condition
(cid:0)c2
S(cid:1)early =

3 − 5p − 6p2 + 6β4[10p2 + p(22p2 − 27) + 12p2(p2 − 2) + 9] − 2β5[9 + 3p(5p − 11) + 4p2(3p2 + 7p − 6)]

We are interested in the case where the today’s values of φ and H are of the orders of Mpl and m, respectively, so
that λ = O(1). Such a very light mass of the vector ﬁeld is only relevant to the physics associated with the late-time
acceleration. In local regions of the Universe the eﬀect of the mass term is negligible, but the derivative interactions
like b4X 2 in G4 play crucial roles to screen the propagation of the ﬁfth force mediated by the vector ﬁeld [32, 40].

C. Models with p2 = 1 and G5 = 0

To be more concrete, we shall ﬁrst study the models with G5 = 0, p2 = 1, and p > 0. In this case, the parameter

β deﬁned in Eq. (5.8) reduces to

To avoid the divergence of QS associated with the sign change of w1 − 2w2, we require the condition (5.42). In the
present case, this translates to

β = 6(2p + 1)β4 − p − 1 .

The upper bound of β4 comes from the condition β < 0.

In this case, we have numerically conﬁrmed that the Cherenkov-radiation constraint of cT is satisﬁed today.

which are positive. Hence the stability of scalar perturbations is always ensured for β4 close to 0.

The evolution of QS/a3 and c2

S plotted in Fig. 3 corresponds to the model parameters β4 = 0.01 and p = 5. In this
case, the constant β4 is in the range consistent with both Eqs. (5.53) and (5.57). In the radiation and matter eras
the parameter qS, which is positive, grows as qS ∝ u2 ∝ t2/p. Since both qS/φ2 and H 2/(w1 − 2w2)2 are constants
in this regime, QS/a3 stays constant for p2 = 1. The quantity qS asymptotically approaches the value (5.56) at the
de Sitter point characterized by ΩDE = 1 and constant u. Provided that λ = O(1), the dimensionless ﬁeld u is of the
order of 1 at the de Sitter attractor, so the mass scale m is of the order of the today’s Hubble parameter H0.
The analytic estimations of qS as well as QS/a3 show good agreement with our numerical results. We also conﬁrm
that the term w1 − 2w2 always remains negative in the numerical analysis of Fig. 3. If we choose the values of β4
which are outside the range of Eqs. (5.50) (e.g., negative β4), we ﬁnd that QS/a3 exhibits a divergence due to the
sign change of w1 − 2w2 around the transient epoch to the cosmic acceleration. For the cosmological viability of the
model with β5 = 0 and p2 = 1, we require the conditions (5.53) and (5.57).
For β4 = 0.01 and p = 5 the analytic estimations (5.58) and (5.59) give (cid:0)c2
S(cid:1)m ≃ 0.288,
respectively, which are in good agreement with the numerical values of c2

T > 1

In the models with p2 = 1 and G5 = 0, the tensor propagation speed is sub-luminal under the condition (5.53). In
this case, the constraint from Cherenkov radiation puts a tight bound on β4. Let us study the possibility for realizing
c2
T > 1 to escape the Cherenkov-radiation constraint for general p2 and G5, while avoiding the divergence of QS.
Provided that

p2β5 < 1/2 ,

the tensor propagation speed squared (5.32) at the de Sitter solution is larger than or equal to 1 for

Under Eq. (5.62) with negative β, the condition (5.42) for avoiding the divergence of QS reads

(5.62)-(5.64). If p2 < 1, for example, the simple case with β4 = β5 = 0 satisﬁes such three conditions. The allowed

during the cosmic expansion history. During the radiation and matter eras the quantity qS evolves as qS ∝ φ2p2 , so
that QS/a3 decreases in proportion to φ−1. After the end of the matter era, QS/a3 approaches the value at the de
Sitter point without any divergence. In Fig. 4 we ﬁnd that c2
T is larger than 1 today, so the bound of Cherenkov
radiation is not applied to this case. Since both c2
S are positive for the model parameters used in Fig. 4, there
are no Laplacian instabilities of vector and scalar perturbations as well.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied the cosmology in generalized Proca theories with three propagating degrees of freedom (besides
two tensor gravitational degrees of freedom) in the presence of a matter ﬂuid. The temporal component φ of the
vector ﬁeld can drive the cosmic acceleration due to the existence of its derivative interactions. By construction of
the action (2.1), there is a branch of the background solution where the ﬁeld φ depends on the Hubble expansion rate
H alone. This allows the existence of de Sitter solutions characterized by constant φ and H.

Expanding the action (2.1) up to second order in cosmological perturbations on the ﬂat FLRW background, we
have derived general conditions for the absence of ghosts and Laplacian instabilities in the small-scale limit. Unlike
scalar-tensor theories, the propagation of vector modes is non-trivial in the sense that the intrinsic vector Lagrangians
proportional to the constants c2 and d2 aﬀect the no-ghost condition and the propagation speed of vector perturbations.
In total, there are six no-ghost and stability conditions associated with tensor, vector, and scalar perturbations.

Applying our general results to de Sitter solutions, we ﬁnd that, in the limit G5 → 0, the function G2 needs to be
negative to avoid the tensor ghost, but this does not necessarily imply the appearance of tachyons. In fact, deﬁning
vector perturbations with the background tetrad basis, the mass squared of the vector mode is positive on the de

21

Sitter solution. In the early cosmological epoch the tensor propagation speed squared is close to 1, but this is not
generally the case for scalar and vector perturbations.

We have also proposed a class of concrete models in which the ﬁeld φ grows as φp ∝ H −1 (p > 0) with the decrease
of H. The functions G2,3,4,5 realizing this solution is given by Eq. (5.2) with the powers satisfying (5.3), which
accommodate vector Galileons as a speciﬁc case (p2 = 1 and p = 1). We have shown the existence of a de Sitter
ﬁxed point which is always stable. Before reaching the de Sitter attractor, the dark energy equation of state evolves
as wDE = −1 − 4s/3 (radiation era) → wDE = −1 − s (matter era), where s = p2/p. For the consistency with the
observations of SNIa, CMB, and BAO, the parameter s is constrained to be 0 < s ≤ 0.36.
For the concrete model proposed in Sec. V, we have discussed the six no-ghost and stability conditions to search
for the theoretically allowed parameter space. For avoiding the divergent behavior of QS during the transient epoch
to the cosmic acceleration, there is an additional condition to be imposed. For the theories with G5 = 0 and p2 = 1,
the parameter β4 is constrained as Eqs. (5.53) and (5.57), in which case the tensor propagation speed cT is sub-
luminal. On using the experimental constraint of cT from the Cherenkov radiation, the upper bound of β4 is tightly
constrained (β4 . 10−16). For more general theories characterized by G5 6= 0 and/or p2 6= 1, we ﬁnd that there exists
the parameter space in which all the theoretically consistent conditions are satisﬁed with c2
We have thus shown that the generalized Proca theories can give rise to the dark energy dynamics compatible with
theoretically consistent conditions. It will be of interest to place observational and experimental constraints on the
parameter space further by taking into account the data of the growth rate of matter perturbations as well as the
bound of the tensor propagation speed.

T ≥ 1.

Finally, we would like to point out that there might be interesting consequences in the presence of the sixth-order
interactions L6 = G6(X)Lµναβ∇µAν∇αAβ + G6,X (X) ˜F µν ˜F αβ∇αAµ∇βAν/2 [38, 39], where Lµναβ is the double dual
Riemann tensor and ˜F µν is the dual of the strength tensor. Since the background vector ﬁeld considered here has
only the zero component non-vanishing, these sixth-order interactions do not contribute at the background level, and
similarly the tensor perturbations are not modiﬁed by them either, but they do have non-trivial eﬀects on the vector
and scalar perturbations. The implications of these sixth-order interactions will be investigated in a future work.
