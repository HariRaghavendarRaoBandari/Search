A HIGH BRAKING INDEX FOR A PULSAR

Draft version March 2, 2016

ABSTRACT

We present a phase-coherent timing solution for PSR J1640–4631, a young 206 ms pulsar using
X-ray timing observations taken with NuSTAR. Over this timing campaign, we have measured the
braking index of PSR J1640–4631 to be n = 3.15 ± 0.03. Using a series of simulations, we argue that
this unusually high braking index is not due to timing noise, but is intrinsic to the pulsar’s spin-down.
We cannot, however, rule out contamination due to an unseen glitch recovery, although the recovery
timescale would have to be longer than most yet observed. If this braking index is eventually proven
to be stable, it demonstrates that pulsar braking indices greater than 3 are allowed in nature, hence
other physical mechanisms such as mass or magnetic quadrupoles are important in pulsar spin-down.
We also present a 3σ upper limit on the pulsed ﬂux at 1.4 GHz of 0.018 mJy.

1.

INTRODUCTION

Pulsars emit light by extracting energy from their rota-
tional kinetic stores. As such, their spin-down is expected
to follow the form (Manchester et al. 1985)

˙ν = −Kνn,

(1)

where ν is the spin frequency of the pulsar,
˙ν the fre-
quency derivative and K a constant of proportionality re-
lated to the pulsar’s moment of inertia and magnetic ﬁeld
structure (Gunn & Ostriker 1969). Here, n is the braking
index. In the standard pulsar model of an unchanging
magnetic dipole in a vacuum, electrodynamics predicts a
value of three (e.g. Manchester & Taylor 1977). In more
realistic models of a pulsar and its magnetosphere, the
braking index is predicted to always lie between 1.8 and
3 (Melatos 1997). Values less than this can be obtained
by relaxing the various assumptions of the model – e.g.
allowing magnetic ﬁeld evolution (Blandford & Romani
1988), momentum loss due to a particle wind (Harding
et al. 1999), or a varying angle between the spin and
magnetic poles (Lyne et al. 2013).

Taking the time derivative of Equation 1 gives us the
following fundamental equation which contains only the
braking index and observable quantities:

where ¨ν is the second-derivative of the spin frequency. A
measurement of n can be made only for the youngest
pulsars for which ¨ν is large enough to detect on hu-
man timescales. As such, only eight pulsars of the
∼ 2400 known have measured braking indices, with val-
ues ranging from 0.9 ± 0.2 to 2.839 ± 0.001 (Lyne et al.
2015, and references therein).

PSR J1640–4631 was discovered as a pulsating X-
ray source in a NuSTAR survey of the Norma region
of the Galactic plane (Gotthelf et al. 2014). The pul-
sar is located in the center of the supernova remnant
G338.1−0.0, and powers the pulsar wind nebula (PWN)
HESS J1640−465, ﬁrst detected in very high-energy
gamma-rays and thought to be the most luminous TeV
source in our Galaxy (Lemiere et al. 2009). We under-
took X-ray timing observations of PSR J1640–4631 start-
ing shortly after discovery with the aim of measuring its
braking index.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND ANALYSIS

All X-ray observations presented in this work were
taken using NuSTAR, which consists of two co-aligned
X-ray telescopes sensitive to photons with energies from
3–79 keV (Harrison et al. 2013). NuSTAR observations
of PSR J1640–4631 were typically 20–50 ks, and the ob-
servation cadence can be seen in Figure 1. Level 1 data
products were obtained from HEASARC and reduced us-
ing nupipeline v0.4.4. Photons from a circular re-
gion having a 30(cid:48)(cid:48) radius centered on the source were
extracted. To maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of the
pulse, we used only photons with energies in the 3.0–
55 keV range.

the photon arrival times from an observation (Living-
stone et al. 2009). To create the template, all observa-
tions were folded into a high signal-to-noise proﬁle. This
high signal-to-noise proﬁle was then ﬁtted to a Fourier
model using the ﬁrst two harmonics. Two harmonics
were chosen to optimally describe the pulse shape, as de-
termined by use of the H-test. (de Jager et al. 1989). We
veriﬁed that TOAs extracted using a cross-correlation
method give consistent results. NuSTAR’s absolute tim-
ing calibration is accurate to ±3 ms (Madsen et al. 2015),
smaller than our measurement uncertainties.

The TOAs were ﬁtted to a standard timing model in
which the phase as a function of time t is described by a
Taylor expansion:

This was done using the TEMPO2 (Hobbs et al. 2006) pul-
sar timing software package. In Table 1 we present a fully
phase-coherent timing solution for PSR J1640–4631 over
the NuSTAR observation campaign. This is the only so-
lution which provides a statistically acceptable ﬁt, i.e.
we have veriﬁed there are no pulse counting ambiguities.
The residuals, the diﬀerence between our timing model
and the observed pulse phases, can be seen in Figure 1.
In the top panel, we show these residuals accounting only
for ν and ˙ν. The bottom panel shows the residuals for
the full timing solution, accounting for ¨ν. Fitting for an
extra frequency derivative, ν··· does not signiﬁcantly im-
prove the ﬁt with the F-test indicating a 52% probability
of the improvement of χ2 being due to chance. We mea-
sure ¨ν = (3.38 ± 0.03) × 10−22 s−3 corresponding to a
braking index of n = 3.15 ± 0.03, where the uncertainty
represents the 68% conﬁdence interval.

rection of change following the glitch. All other braking indices are

2.1. Timing Noise Simulations

A possible way to explain such a large measured brak-
ing index is contamination from timing noise. Timing
noise refers to unexplained low-frequency modulations
found in the timing residuals of many, particularly young,
pulsars (Arzoumanian et al. 1994). Timing noise in ra-
dio pulsars has been observed to be spectrally ‘red’, that

et al. 1994). As such, it can contaminate measurements
of ¨ν, and thus n (Hobbs et al. 2010). The power spectral
density (PSD) of timing noise is often modeled as

(cid:18)

(cid:19)−q/2

f 2
f 2
c

ΦT N (f ) = A

1 +

,

(4)

where A is the spectral density amplitude, fc the cor-
ner frequency, and q the power-law index (Lasky et al.
2015). A q of 0 represents a white noise power spectrum,
whereas indices of 2, 4, and 6 represent random walks in
pulse arrival phase, the pulse frequency, and frequency
derivative, respectively.

To quantify the probability of timing noise biasing our
measurement of the braking index, we conducted a se-
ries of simulations that aimed to determine whether any
reasonable form of red noise artiﬁcially results in a mea-
surement of n > 3, given the observed (i.e. white) noise
properties of the resulting timing residuals. As timing
noise in real pulsars can have PSDs with many indices
we created 105 realizations of red noise and injected them
into simulated pulsar TOAs, with TOA uncertainties, ν,
and ˙ν identical to that of the pulsar, but with a braking
index of n = 3.

To do this we used the simRedNoise plug-in of TEMPO2.
We simulated parameters on a grid, drawing 10 iterations
from each set of parameters. We simulated A ranging
from 10−20–10−18 s2yr−1 with 20 log-spaced steps, q be-
tween 0–6 with 25 linear steps, and fc from 10−3–100.5
yr−1 in 20 log-space steps. The upper bound on A was
chosen to ensure phase connection was possible, as larger
values of A precluded phase connection more that 50%
of the time, and hence are ruled out by our observations.
After the noise injection, the new TOAs were ﬁtted to
the full timing model to measure n, allowing ν,
˙ν, and
¨ν to vary. We considered any iterations where the χ2
value indicated that a probability of less than 1% ruled
out by our measured residuals, as this would indicate
unaccounted for noise. After this, only in 0.01% of all
the simulations could produce a braking index greater
than three with the measured signiﬁcance. The param-
eter regime which gave this highest probability of artiﬁ-
cially producing a high braking index was when fc was
of order the observing length with the highest values of
A. There is only a weak dependence on q, with larger
values producing more false positives.

Another way to check for the possible contamination
of our measured value of n by timing noise is by con-
sidering the third frequency derivative. In our data, the
third frequency derivative is consistent with zero at the
1σ level, We ran another suite of simulations within the
parameter space described above wherein we ﬁtted up
to a third frequency derivative. We note that there is a
covariance, with the second and third frequency deriva-
tives being anti-correlated. Only in 0.008% of simulated
sets of residuals can we reproduce a braking index sig-
niﬁcantly greater than three without having a detectable
third frequency derivative.

These simulations indicate that only a very low level
of timing noise can be present in our data, and the mea-
sured braking index of n = 3.15 ± 0.03 is highly unlikely
to be due to timing noise. We note that the assumed
value of n = 3 in our simulations is conservative, since

when assuming n < 3, it is even less likely for timing
noise to result in a measured n > 3.

2.2. Parkes Observations

In order

to search for

radio pulsations

from
PSR J1640–4631, we undertook observations with the
64-m Parkes Telescope. Observations were performed
in two sessions totaling 14.96 hours at the position of
PSR J1640–4631 (Lemiere et al. 2009). Data were taken
by observing with the central beam of the 21 cm Multi-
beam receiver, using the BPSR pulsar backend. These
observations were taken on 2014 April 18 and 2015 April
27 (MJDs 56765 and 56775, respectively) at center fre-
quency 1382 MHz over 400 MHz of bandwidth, divided
into 1024 channels. The data from each channel were de-
tected and the two polarizations summed to form a time
series with 64-µs samples.

We searched these data using the known pulsar spin
frequency and frequency derivative from the phase-
coherent timing analysis found in this article. We
searched over 4704 dispersion measures between 0 and
1600 pc cm−3. No signal was found in these data, and so
we quote an upper limit to the pulsar ﬂux at this fre-
quency, using the radiometer equation for the rms noise
from the observing system:

G(cid:112)nptobs∆f

Tsys

σrms =

,

(5)

where Tsys is the system temperature in Kelvin, G is the
receiver gain in K/Jy, np is the number of polarizations,
tobs is the total integration time in seconds, and ∆f is
the observing bandwidth in Hz. From this, we calculate a
3σ upper ﬂux limit of 0.018 mJy at 1.4 GHz. This upper
limit assumes a 50% duty cycle, with the upper limit

scaling as(cid:112)DC/(1 − DC), where DC is the duty cycle.

This ﬂux limit is low, but not unusually so, especially
when one considers that the estimated distance to the
source is ∼12 kpc.

3. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS

A possible contaminant to the measured braking in-
dex is a long-term recovery from an unseen glitch prior
to our monitoring. If such a glitch occurred, a typical
exponential recovery would, in general, cause an artiﬁ-
cially high value for ¨ν to be measured (e.g. Johnston &
Galloway 1999; Hobbs et al. 2010). Indeed, for pulsars
with τc < 105 yrs, there is a clear preference for positive
¨ν, compared to older pulsars which are equally likely to
have positive or negative ¨ν (e.g. Hobbs et al. 2010). If we
assume an exponentially recovering glitch contaminating
a constant braking index we can, from our upper limit of
ν···, place a lower limit on the decay timescale for such a

glitch to be τ = 250 3(cid:112)∆νd/10−8Hz days, where νd is the

size of the unseen decaying glitch. In Yu et al. (2013), of
the 107 glitches detected, 27 had a detected exponential
recovery. Of those, only 3 were longer than 200 days. We
thus cannot rule out contamination due to a prior unseen
glitch recovery as an explanation for the high measured
braking index, although the recovery time scale would
have to be longer than most yet observed. Ultimately
this hypothesis can be tested by continued monitoring.

Measurements of braking indices could also be contam-
inated by uncertainties in the pulsar’s position, or proper

4

motion (Bisnovatyi-Kogan & Postnov 1993). The posi-
tion of PSR J1640–4631 is well determined by Chandra
to a 3σ error radius of 0.6” (Lemiere et al. 2009). This
positional error at the ecliptic latitude of PSR J1640–
4631 would add a 1.0 ms root-mean-square signal to our
timing residuals, far smaller than our measurement un-
certainties. For PSR J1640–4631’s estimated distance of
8–13 kpc (Lemiere et al. 2009), and a typical pulsar kick
velocity of 300 km s−1 (Hansen & Phinney 1997), an un-
modeled proper motion would change the measured brak-
ing index by less than one part in a million. Thus neither
of these eﬀects can account for our measured braking in-
dex.

The pulsar’s high luminosity PWN has been argued
to be powered by a relativistic outﬂow or wind from the
neutron star. Under this assumption, predictions for the
pulsar’s spin-down history and hence braking index have
been made (Gotthelf et al. 2014). The 0.2–10 TeV lu-
minosity of the PWN powered by the source represents
∼ 6% of the pulsar’s current spin-down luminosity (Got-
thelf et al. 2014). A pulsar whose spin-down is driven
solely by a particle wind would result in a braking index
of one (Michel 1969; Manchester et al. 1985). Further-
more, a combination of magnetic dipole radiation and
wind braking would result in a braking index with value
between one and three. In this case, the braking index
as a function of , the fraction of spin-down power due
to a particle wind, is given by (Lyne et al. 2015)

n =

2

 + 1

+ 1.

(6)

This implies a maximal expected braking index of n=2.89
for PSR J1640–4631. Indeed, a more thorough modeling
of the pulsar and PWN system suggested an even smaller
braking index, n ≈ 1.9 (Gotthelf et al. 2014), clearly at
odds with our result.

A changing magnetic ﬁeld has also been put forth as a
possibility for a braking index that is diﬀerent from three
by the growth or decay of the ﬁeld (Blandford & Romani
1988; Gourgouliatos & Cumming 2015), or a change in
the angle between the magnetic and rotation axes(Lyne
et al. 2013). In this case, n is given by:

(cid:33)

(cid:32) ˙B

B

n = 3 + 2

ν
˙ν

+

˙α

tanα

.

(7)

For the decaying ﬁeld case, this would imply a magnetic
ﬁeld decay rate of ∼ 200 MG per century. This decay
rate is very close to that predicted in some magneto-
thermal evolutionary models (Vigan`o et al. 2013), and
in this interpretation might be providing direct obser-
vational evidence of a decaying magnetic ﬁeld. On the
other hand, population synthesis studies ﬁnd no strong
evidence for ﬁeld decay in the radio pulsar population as
a whole (Faucher-Gigu`ere & Kaspi 2006).

If a change in the alignment angle between the mag-
netic and rotational axes is the cause of the anomalous
braking index then either α is less than π/2 and the ro-
tation and magnetic axes are moving towards alignment,
or α is greater than π/2 and the rotation and magnetic
axes are counter-aligning. If α is changing on order of
the rate of the Crab pulsar (Lyne et al. 2013), the only
pulsar for which such a change has been measured, at

∼ 1◦ per century, this would imply that α is ∼ 5◦ away
from being an orthogonal rotator. This is at odds with
the pulse proﬁle being single peaked, since an orthogonal
rotator would typically be seen to have emission as each
pole enters our line of sight. In general, the value of α
for pulsars can be independently determined by modeling
of the gamma-ray or radio pulse proﬁles. PSR J1640–
4631, however, is radio quiet, see §2.2 . There are also
no detected gamma-ray pulsations from PSR J1640–4631
(Gotthelf et al. 2014), and so the value of α is unknown
for this source.

Another possibility to explain a braking index greater
than three is to invoke higher order multipoles (P´etri
2015). A pure quadrupole, either a magnetic quadrupole,
or a mass quadrupole leading to gravitational radiation
(Blandford & Romani 1988), would yield a braking index
of 5, and could coexist with the magnetic dipole to give
a braking index between 3 and 5. Analogous to the case
of a wind, the fraction of spin down due to a quadrupole
versus a dipole, Q is (Palomba 2000):

n − 3
5 − n

.

Q =

(8)
In our case, this implies ∼ 8% of the spin down is due to
quadrupolar radiation. In the case of a mass quadrupole,
this would imply that the pulsar has an ellipticity of
∼ 0.005, which cannot be reproduced by theoretically
proposed dense matter equations of state, for a neutron
star rotating at 4.84 Hz (Owen 2005). If such an elliptic-
ity did exist, it would produce gravitational waves having
at twice the

a maximum strain of ∼ 4 × 10−26(cid:16) 12kpc

(cid:17)

d

spin-period of the pulsar (Palomba 2000), which is far
below the detection sensitivity of current technology.

The existence of a magnetic quadrupole is in princi-
ple testable with future X-ray polarimeter missions. X-
ray polarization measurements of neutron stars are in
principle sensitive to the magnetospheric conﬁguration,
(van Adelsberg & Lai 2006; Taverna et al. 2014) be it a
quadrupolar ﬁeld structure or a change in the alignment
of the spin and magnetic poles. The speciﬁc magnetic
ﬁeld structure of pulsars has a strong impact on the in-
ferred magnetic ﬁeld strength, as well as predicted radio
and gamma-ray pulse proﬁles (P´etri 2015). Thus X-ray
polarimetric observations of PSR J1640–4631 could help
us understand the origin of the pulsar’s high n, and shed
light on the range of possibilities of neutron-star mag-
netic ﬁeld structure.

Since the ﬁrst measurement of the Crab’s braking in-
dex in 1972 (Boynton et al. 1972), we have known that
various physical mechanisms, such as angular momen-
tum loss due to a wind, can result in a pulsar brak-
ing index less than the canonical dipole value. Our re-
sults for PSR J1640–4631 now show that other physics,
such as the quadrupole moment of the magnetic ﬁeld,
aﬀect the evolution of this source, and likely rotation-
powered pulsars, in general. Given that two other young,
high-magnetic ﬁeld pulsars have experienced glitches
that resulted in a signiﬁcant drop in the braking index
(Archibald et al. 2015; Antonopoulou et al. 2015), it is
clear that continuous study of braking indices provides
an important window into additional physical processes
at work in the youngest and most energetic of neutron
stars.
