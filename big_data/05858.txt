A BRIDGE BETWEEN DUBOVITSKI˘I–FEDERER

THEOREMS AND THE COAREA FORMULA

Piotr Haj lasz, Mikhail V. Korobkov, and Jan Kristensen

March 21, 2016

Abstract

The Morse–Sard theorem requires that a mapping v : Rn → Rm is of class Ck,
In 1957 Dubovitski˘ı generalized this result by proving that
k > max(n − m, 0).
almost all level sets for a Ck mapping has Hs-negligible intersection with its critical
set, where s = max(n − m − k + 1, 0). Here the critical set, or m-critical set
is deﬁned as Zv,m = {x ∈ Rn : rank∇v(x) < m}. Another generalization was
obtained independently by Dubovitski˘ı and Federer in 1966, namely for Ck mappings
v : Rn → Rd and integers m ≤ d they proved that the set of m–critical values v(Zv,m)
is Hq◦-negligible for q◦ = m − 1 + n−m+1
. They also established the sharpness of
these results within the Ck category.

Here we prove that Dubovitski˘ı’s theorem can be generalized to the case of
continuous mappings of the Sobolev–Lorentz class Wk
k (these are
minimal integrability assumptions that guarantees the continuity of mappings). In
this situation the mappings need not to be everywhere diﬀerentiable and in order
to handle the set of nondiﬀerentiability points, we establish for such mappings an
analog of the Luzin N –property with respect to lower dimensional Hausdorﬀ content.
Finally, we formulate and prove a bridge theorem that includes all the above results
as particular cases. As a limiting case in this bridge theorem we also establish a
new coarea type formula: if E ⊂ {x ∈ Rn : rank∇v(x) ≤ m}, then
Hn−m(E ∩ v−1(y)) dHm(y).

The mapping v is Rd–valued, with arbitrary d, and the formula is obtained without
any restrictions on the image v(Rn) (such as m-rectiﬁability or σ-ﬁniteness with
respect to the m-Hausdorﬀ measure). These last results are new also for smooth
mappings, but are presented here in the general Sobolev context.

The proofs of all these results are based on our previous joint papers with J. Bour-

gain (2013, 2015).

Introduction

The Morse–Sard theorem in its classical form states that the image of the set of critical
points of a Cn−m+1 smooth mapping v : Rn → Rm has zero Lebesgue measure in Rm.
More precisely, assuming that n ≥ m, the set of critical points for v is Zv = {x ∈ Rn :
rank∇v(x) < m} and the conclusion is that

L m(v(Zv)) = 0.

(1.1)

The theorem was proved by Morse [42] in the case m = 1 and subsequently by Sard [47]
in the general vector–valued case. The celebrated results of Whitney [51] show that the
Cn−m+1 smoothness assumption on the mapping v is sharp. However, the following result
gives valuable information also for less smooth mappings.
Theorem A (Dubovitski˘ı 1957 [18]). Let n, m, k ∈ N, and let v : Rn → Rm be a
Ck–smooth mapping. Put s = n − m − k + 1. Then

Hs(Zv ∩ v−1(y)) = 0

for a.a. y ∈ Rm,

(1.2)

where Hs denotes the s–dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure and Zv is the set of critical points
of v.

Here and in the following we interpret Hβ as the counting measure when β ≤ 0. Thus
for k ≥ n − m + 1 we have s ≤ 0, and Hs in (1.2) becomes simply the counting measure,
so the Dubovitski˘ı theorem contains the Morse–Sard theorem as particular case1.
A few years later and almost simultaneously, Dubovitski˘ı [19] in 1967 and Federer [23,
Theorem 3.4.3] in 19692 published another important generalization of the Morse–Sard
theorem.
Theorem B (Dubovitski˘ı–Federer). For n, k, d ∈ N let m ∈ {1, . . . , min(n, d)} and
v : Rn → Rd be a Ck–smooth mapping. Put q◦ = m + s

k . Then

Hq◦(v(Zv,m)) = 0.

(1.3)

where, as above, s = n − m − k + 1 and Zv,m denotes the set of m–critical points of v
deﬁned as Zv,m = {x ∈ Rn : rank∇v(x) < m}.

In view of the wide range of applicability of the above results it is a natural and
compelling problem to decide to what extent they admit extensions to classes of Sobolev
mappings. The ﬁrst Morse–Sard result in the Sobolev context that we are aware of is due
to L. De Pascale [16] (though see also [34]). It states that (1.1) holds for mappings v of

1It is interesting to note that because of the isolation of the former Soviet Union this ﬁrst Dubovitski˘ı
theorem was almost unknown to Western mathematicians; another proof was given in the recent paper [9]
covering also some extensions to the case of H¨older spaces.

2Federer announced [22] his result in 1966, this announcement (without any proofs) was sent
on 08.02.1966. For the historical details, Dubovitski˘ı sent his paper [19] (with complete proofs) a month
earlier, on 10.01.1966.

p for some

class Wk
embedding theorem any mapping on Rn which is locally of Sobolev class Wk
p > n is in particular Ck−1, so the critical set Zv can be deﬁned as usual.

In the recent paper [25] P. Haj lasz and S. Zimmermann proved Theorem A under the
p,loc(Rn, Rm), p > n, which corresponds to that used by L. De

assumption that v ∈ Wk
Pascale [16].

In view of the existing counter–examples to Morse–Sard type results in the classical
Ck context the issue is not the value of k, — that is, how many weak derivatives are
needed. Instead the question is, what are the minimal integrability assumptions on the
weak derivatives for Morse–Sard type results to be valid in the Sobolev case. Of course,
it is natural here to restrict attention to continuous mappings, and so to require from the
p(Rn, Rd) should guarantee at least
considered function spaces that the inclusion v ∈ Wk
the continuity of v (assuming always that the mappings are precisely represented). For
p(Rn, Rd) is continuous for p > n
values k ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1} it is well–known that v ∈ Wk

and could be discontinuous for p ≤ n
k . It is
p◦(Rn, Rd) is continuous if the derivatives
well–known (see for instance [29, 31]) that v ∈ Wk
of k-th order belong to the Lorentz space Lp◦,1, we will denote the space of such mappings
by Wk

p◦,1(Rn, Rd). We refer to section 3 for relevant deﬁnitions and notation.
In [32] it was shown that mappings v ∈ Wk

p◦,1(Rn, Rd) are diﬀerentiable (in the classical
Fr´echet–Peano sense) at each point outside some Hp◦–negligible set Av.3 Thus we deﬁne
for integers m ≤ min{n, d} the m–critical set as

k . So the borderline case is p = p◦ = n

Zv,m = {x ∈ Rn \ Av : rank∇v(x) < m}.

(1.4)

In previous joint papers of two of the authors with J. Bourgain [12, 13] and in [31, 32] this
deﬁnition of critical set was used and a corresponding Dubovitski˘ı–Federer Theorem B
p◦(Rn, Rd). If, in addition, the highest
was established for mappings of Sobolev class Wk
derivative ∇kv belongs to the Lorentz space Lp◦,1 (in particular, if k = n since L1,1 = L1),
also the Luzin N–property with respect to the p◦–dimensional Hausdorﬀ content was
proven.
It implies, in particular, that the image of the set Av of nondiﬀerentiability
points has zero measure, and consequently, C1-smoothness of almost all level sets follows.
In this paper we prove the Dubovitski˘ı Theorem A for mappings of the same Sobolev–

Lorentz class Wk
Theorem 1.1. Let k, m ∈ {1, . . . , n}, d ≥ m and v ∈ Wk

p◦,1 and with values in Rd for arbitrary d ≥ m.

p◦,1(Rn, Rd). Then the equality

Hs(Zv,m ∩ v−1(y)) = 0

for Hm-a.a. y ∈ Rd

(1.5)

holds, where as above s = n − m − k + 1 and Zv,m denotes the set of m–critical points
of v: Zv,m = {x ∈ Rn \ Av : rank∇v(x) < m}.

3It was also proven that each point x ∈ Rn \ Av is an Lp◦ -Lebesgue point for the weak gradient ∇v.
p◦ (Rn) the corresponding exceptional set U has

small Bessel capacity Bk−m,p(U ) < ε, and, respectively, the gradients ∇mv are well-deﬁned in Rn except
for some exceptional set of zero Bessel capacity Bk−m,p (see, e.g., Chapter 3 in [53] or [9] ).

To the best of our knowledge the result is new even when the mapping v : Rn → Rd
is of class Ck since we allow here m < d (compare with Theorem A). However, the main
thrust of the result is the extension to the Sobolev–Lorentz context that we believe is
essentially sharp. In this context we also wish to emphasize that the result is in harmony
with our deﬁnition of critical set (recall that Hp◦(Av) = 0 ) and the following new analog
of the Luzin N-property:
Theorem 1.2. Let k, m ∈ {1, . . . , n}, d ≥ m and v ∈ Wk
A with Hp◦(A) = 0 we have

p◦,1(Rn, Rd). Then for any set

Hs(A ∩ v−1(y)) = 0

for Hm-a.a. y ∈ Rd,

where again s = n − m − k + 1.

(1.6)

We end this section with remarks about the possibility to localize our results.

Remark 1.1. We have formulated the results in the context of mappings v : Rn → Rd for
mere convenience. However, the reader can easily check that the essence of our results is
at the local level and so they also apply to mappings v : N → D that are locally of class
Wk
p◦,1 between a second countable n–dimensional smooth manifold N and a d–dimensional
smooth manifold D.
Remark 1.2. Since for an open set U ⊂ Rn of ﬁnite measure the estimate k1U · fkLp◦,1 ≤

the results of the above theorems 1.1–1.2 are in particular valid for mappings v that are

2 A Bridge between the theorems of Dubovitski˘ı and

Federer

Originally, the purpose of the present paper was very concrete: to extend the Dubovitski˘ı
Theorem A to the Sobolev context (since the Federer–Dubovitski˘ı Theorem B had been
extended before in [31, 32], see Introduction and Subsection 4). But when our paper was
ﬁnished and ready for submission, the very natural question arose. Theorem A asserts
that Hm-almost all preimages are small (with respect to Hs-measure), and Theorem B
claims that Hq◦-almost all preimages are empty. Could we connect these results? More
precisely, could we say something about Hq–almost all preimages for other values of q,
say, for q ∈ [m − 1, q◦]? The aﬃrmative answer is contained in the next theorem.
Theorem 2.1. k, m ∈ {1, . . . , n}, d ≥ m and v ∈ Wk
(m − 1,∞) the equality

holds, where

µq := s + k(m − q),

s = n − m − k + 1,

(2.2)

and Zv,m again denotes the set of m-critical points of v: Zv,m = {x ∈ Rn \ Av
rank∇v(x) ≤ m − 1}.

:

Let us note, that the behavior of the function µq is very natural:

µq = 0

µq < 0

for q = q◦ = m − 1 + n−m+1
for q > q◦;

µq = s

for q = m;

µq = n − m + 1

for q = m − 1.

4.2 ) as particular cases and it is new even for the smooth case.

Evidently, Theorem 2.1 contains all the previous theorems (Morse–Sard, A, B, 1.1 and

We emphasize the fact that in stating Theorem 2.1 we skipped the borderline case
q = m− 1, µq = n− m + 1. Of course, for this case we cannot assert that Hm−1–almost all
preimages in the m–critical set Zv,m have zero Hn−m+1–measure as the above mentioned
counterexample with a linear mapping L : Rn → Rd of rank m − 1 shows. But for this
borderline case we obtain instead the following analog of the classical coarea formula:

n,1(Rn, Rd). Then for
Theorem 2.2. Let n, d ∈ N, m ∈ {0, . . . , min(n, d)}, and v ∈ W1
any Lebesgue measurable subset E of Zv,m+1 = {x ∈ Rn \ Av : rank∇v(x) ≤ m} we have

ZE

Jmv(x) dx =ZRd

Hn−m(E ∩ v−1(y)) dHm(y),

(2.4)

where Jmv(x) denotes the m–Jacobian of v deﬁned as the product of the m largest singular
values of the matrix ∇v(x).

The proof relies crucially on the results of [44] and [27] that give criteria for the
validity of the coarea formula for Lipschitz mappings between metric spaces, see also [6]
and [38, 39].

Thus, to study the level sets for the borderline case q = m − 1 in Theorem 2.1, one

must take m′ = m − 1 instead of m in Theorem 2.2.
Remark 2.1. Note that for the case m = n the formula (2.4) corresponds to the area
formula whose validity for Sobolev mappings supporting the N–property is well-known
(see, e.g., [35] and [29], where the N-property was established for mappings of class W 1
n,1 ).

5

But for m < n the result is new even for smooth mappings, since usually the formula (2.4)
is proved under the assumption d = m (see, e.g., [39] for Sobolev functions W 1
p (Rn, Rm) )
or, when m < d, under the assumption that the image v(E) is a Hm-σ–ﬁnite set (e.g.,
[44], [27], see also Theorem 5.1 of the present paper ).
From the Coarea formula (2.4) it follows directly, that the set of y ∈ Rd where the inte-
grand in the right-hand side of (2.4) is positive, is Hm-σ–ﬁnite. Indeed, from Theorem 2.2
and [27, Theorem 1.3] we obtain immediately the following more precise statement:
Corollary 2.1. Let m ∈ {0, . . . , min(d, n)} and v ∈ W1

n,1(Rn, Rd). Then the set

(cid:26)y ∈ Rd : Hn−m(cid:0)Zv,m+1 ∩ v−1(y)(cid:1) > 0(cid:27)

is Hm–rectiﬁable, i.e., it is a union of a set of Hm-measure zero and a countable family
of images gi(Si) of Lipschitz mappings gi : Si ⊆ Rm → Rd. Here again Zv,m+1 = {x ∈
Rn \ Av : rank∇v(x) ≤ m}.
n,1(Rn) for k ∈ {1, . . . , n}, p◦ = n
Remark 2.2. In view of the embedding Wk
(see, e.g., [37, §8] ), the assertions of Theorem 2.2 and Corollary 2.1 are in particular valid
for the mappings v ∈ Wk
that Hp◦(Av) = 0 ) because of the following analog of the Luzin N-property:
Theorem 2.3. Let k ∈ {1, . . . , n}, p◦ = n/k and v ∈ Wk
p ∈ [p◦, n], q ∈ [0, p] and for any set E ⊂ Rn with H p(E) = 0 we have

Again Theorems 2.1 and 2.2 are in harmony with our deﬁnition of critical set (recall

p◦,1(Rn, Rd), i.e., under the conditions of Theorem 2.1.

p◦,1(Rn, Rd). Then for every

p◦,1(Rn) ֒→ W1

k

(2.5)

(2.6)

In particular,

Hp−q(E ∩ v−1(y)) = 0
Hp(cid:0)v(E)(cid:1) = 0

for Hq-a.a. y ∈ Rd.

whenever Hp(E) = 0,

p ∈ [p◦, n].

By simple calculation we have for q ∈ [0, q◦] that
µq = n − m − k + 1 + k(m − q) = (p◦ − q)k + (m − 1)(k − 1) ≥ max(p◦ − q, 0). (2.7)

Theorem 2.3 then yields
Corollary 2.2. Let k, m ∈ {1, . . . , n} and v ∈ Wk
and for any set E with Hp◦(E) = 0 we have

p◦,1(Rn, Rd). Then for every q ∈ [0, +∞)

Hµq (E ∩ v−1(y)) = 0

for Hq–a.a. y ∈ Rd.

Consequently, for every q ∈ [0, +∞)

Hµq (Av ∩ v−1(y)) = 0

for Hq–a.a. y ∈ Rd,

(2.8)

(2.9)

where we recall that Av is the set of nondiﬀerentiability points of v (cf. with (2.1) ).

Finally, applying the N-property (Theorem 2.3) for p = n, q = m ≤ n, we obtain

6

Corollary 2.3. Let n, d ∈ N, m ∈ [0, n], and v ∈ W1
zero n-Lebesgue measure L n(E) = 0 the identity

n,1(Rn, Rd). Then for any set E of

Hn−m(E ∩ v−1(y)) = 0

for Hm-a.a. y ∈ Rd

(2.10)

holds.

Thus the sets of n-Lebesgue measure zero (in particular, the set of nondiﬀerentiability

points Av ) are negligible in the Coarea formula (2.4).

Finally, let us comment brieﬂy on the proofs that merge ideas from our previous
papers [13], [31, 32] and [25]. In particular, the joint papers [12, 13] by two of the authors
with J. Bourgain contain many of the key ideas that allow us to consider nondiﬀerentiable
Sobolev mappings. For the implementation of these ideas one relies on estimates for the
Hardy–Littlewood maximal function in terms of Choquet type integrals with respect to
Hausdorﬀ capacity. In order to take full advantage of the Lorentz context we exploit the
recent estimates from [32] (recalled in Theorem 3.1 below, see also [1] for the case p = 1).
As in [13] (and subsequently in [31]) we also crucially use Y. Yomdin’s (see [52]) entropy
estimates of near critical values for polynomials (recalled in Theorem 3.2 below).

In addition to the above mentioned papers there is a growing number of papers on the

topic, including [5, 7, 8, 9, 14, 24, 26, 41, 43, 45, 49, 50].

3 Preliminaries

By an n–dimensional interval we mean a closed cube in Rn with sides parallel to the coor-
dinate axes. If Q is an n–dimensional cubic interval then we write ℓ(Q) for its sidelength.
For a subset S of Rn we write L n(S) for its outer Lebesgue measure. The m–
dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure is denoted by Hm and the m–dimensional Hausdorﬀ con-
tent by Hm

∞. Recall that for any subset S of Rn we have by deﬁnition

Hm(S) = lim

αց0Hm

α (S) = sup

α>0 Hm

α (S),

where for each 0 < α ≤ ∞,

α (S) = inf( ∞Xi=1

(diam Si)m : diam Si ≤ α, S ⊂

Si) .

∞[i=1

Hm

It is well known that Hn(S) = Hn

∞(S) ∼ L n(S) for sets S ⊂ Rn.

To simplify the notation, we write kfkLp instead of kfkLp(Rn), etc.
The Sobolev space Wk

p(Rn, Rd) is as usual deﬁned as consisting of those Rd-valued
functions f ∈ Lp(Rn) whose distributional partial derivatives of orders l ≤ k belong to

7

Lp(Rn) (for detailed deﬁnitions and diﬀerentiability properties of such functions see, e.g.,
[20], [40], [53], [17]). Denote by ∇kf the vector-valued function consisting of all k-th order
partial derivatives of f arranged in some ﬁxed order. However, for the case of ﬁrst order
derivatives k = 1 we shall often think of ∇f (x) as the Jacobi matrix of f at x, thus the
d × n matrix whose r-th row is the vector of partial derivatives of the r-th coordinate
function.

We use the norm

kfkWk

p = kfkLp + k∇fkLp + · · · + k∇kfkLp,

and unless otherwise speciﬁed all norms on the spaces Rs (s ∈ N) will be the usual
euclidean norms.
Working with locally integrable functions, we always assume that the precise repre-
sentatives are chosen. If w ∈ L1,loc(Ω), then the precise representative w∗ is deﬁned for
all x ∈ Ω by

w(z) dz,

if the limit exists and is ﬁnite,

where the dashed integral as usual denotes the integral mean,

L n(B(x, r))ZB(x,r)

w(z) dz,

and B(x, r) = {y : |y − x| < r} is the open ball of radius r centered at x. Henceforth we
omit special notation for the precise representative writing simply w∗ = w.
We will say that x is an Lp–Lebesgue point of w (and simply a Lebesgue point when

p = 1), if

−ZB(x,r) |w(z) − w(x)|p dz → 0

as

r ց 0.

If k < n, then it is well-known that functions from Sobolev spaces Wk

p(Rn) are con-
tinuous for p > n
k (see, e.g., [40, 53]). The
p◦(Rn) is a reﬁnement of the corresponding Sobolev
Sobolev–Lorentz space Wk
space that for our purposes turns out to be convenient. Among other things functions
that are locally in Wk

k and could be discontinuous for p ≤ p◦ = n

p◦,1 on Rn are in particular continuous.

p◦,1(Rn) ⊂ Wk

Here we shall mainly be concerned with the Lorentz space Lp,1, and in this case one

may rewrite the norm as (see for instance [37, Proposition 3.6])

kfkp,1 =

+∞Z0 (cid:2)L n({x ∈ Rn : |f (x)| > t})(cid:3) 1

p dt.

We record the following subadditivity property of the Lorentz norm for later use.

For a subset A of Rm and ε > 0 the ε–entropy of A, denoted by Ent(ε, A), is the
minimal number of closed balls of radius ε covering A. Further, for a linear map L : Rn →
Rd we denote by λj(L), j = 1, . . . , d, its singular values arranged in decreasing order:
λ1(L) ≥ λ2(L) ≥ · · · ≥ λd(L). Geometrically the singular values are the lengths of the
semiaxes of the ellipsoid L(∂B(0, 1)). We recall that the singular values of L coincide
with the eigenvalues repeated according to multiplicity of the symmetric nonnegative
linear map √LL∗ : Rd → Rd. Also for a mapping f : Rn → Rd that is approximately
diﬀerentiable at x ∈ Rn put λj(f, x) = λj(dxf ), where by dxf we denote the approximate
diﬀerential of f at x. The next result is the second basic ingredient of our proof.
Theorem 3.2 ([52]). For any polynomial P : Rn → Rd of degree at most k, for each ball
B ⊂ Rn of radius r > 0, and any number ε > 0 we have that

Ent(cid:0)εr,{P (x) : x ∈ B, λ1 ≤ 1 + ε, . . . , λm−1 ≤ 1 + ε, λm ≤ ε, . . . , λd ≤ ε}(cid:1)

where the constant CY depends on n, d, k, m only and for brevity we wrote λj = λj(P, x).

≤ CY(cid:0)1 + ε1−m(cid:1),

The application of Theorem 3.1 is facilitated through the following simple estimate

(see for instance Lemma 2 in [17], cf. with [11] ).
Lemma 3.3. Let u ∈ W1
number ε > 0 the estimate

1(Rn, Rd). Then for any ball B ⊂ Rn of radius r > 0 and for any

diam({u(x) : x ∈ B, (M∇u)(x) ≤ ε}) ≤ CM εr

holds, where CM is a constant depending on n, d only.

We need also the following approximation result.

Theorem 3.3 (see Theorem 2.1 in [32]). Let p ∈ (1,∞), k, l ∈ {1, . . . , n}, l ≤ k,
(k − l)p < n. Then for any f ∈ Wk
p,1(Rn) and for each ε > 0 there exist an open set
U ⊂ Rn and a function g ∈ Cl(Rn) such that
(i) Hn−(k−l)p
(ii) each point x ∈ Rn \ U is an Lp-Lebesgue point for ∇jf , j = 0, . . . , l;
(iii) f ≡ g, ∇jf ≡ ∇jg on Rn \ U for j = 1, . . . , l.

(U) < ε;

∞

Note that in the analogous theorem for the case of Sobolev mappings f ∈ Wk

assertion (i) should be reformulated as follows:

p(Rn) the

(i’) Bk−l,p(U) < ε if l < k,

Recall that for 1 < p < ∞ and 0 < n − αp < n the smallness of Hn−αp

where Bα,p(U) denotes the Bessel capacity of the set U (see, e.g., Chapter 3 in [53] or [9] ).
∞ (U) implies
the smallness of Bα,p(U), but that the opposite is false since Bα,p(U) = 0 whenever
Hn−αp(U) < ∞. On the other hand, for 1 < p < ∞ and 0 < n−αp < β ≤ n the smallness
of Bα,p(U) implies the smallness of Hβ
∞(U) (see, e.g., [4]). So the usual assertion (i’) is
essentially weaker than (i).

4 Luzin N - and Morse–Sard properties for Sobolev–

Lorentz mappings

In this section we brieﬂy recall some theorems from [31, 32] which we need. The following
result is an analog of the Luzin N-property with respect to the Hausdorﬀ content.
Theorem 4.1 ([31, 32]). Let k ∈ {1, . . . , n}, q ∈ [p◦, n], and v ∈ Wk
for each ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that for any set E ⊂ Rn if Hq
Hq
∞(v(E)) < ε. In particular, Hq(v(E)) = 0 whenever Hq(E) = 0.
The next asertion is the precise analog of the Dubovitski˘ı–Federer theorem B (see

p◦,1(Rn, Rd). Then
∞(E) < δ, then

Introduction 1 ) which includes the Morse–Sard result.
Theorem 4.2 ([31, 32]). If k, m ∈ {1, . . . , n}, Ω is an open subset of Rn, and v ∈
Wk

p◦,1,loc(Ω, Rd), then Hq◦(v(Zv,m)) = 0.
Recall that in our notation

s = n − m − k + 1,

= p◦ + (m − 1)(cid:0)1 − k−1(cid:1),

(4.1)

and Zv,m = {x ∈ Ω : rank∇v(x) < m}.

Finally, here we recall some diﬀerentiability properties of Sobolev–Lorentz functions.

Theorem 4.3 ([31, 32]). Let k ∈ {1, . . . , n} and v ∈ Wk
p◦,1(Rn, Rd). Then there exists
a Borel set Av ⊂ Rn such that Hp◦(Av) = 0 and for any x ∈ Rn \ Av the function v
is diﬀerentiable (in the classical Fr´echet sense) at x, furthermore, the classical derivative
coincides with ∇v(x) (x is a Lp◦-Lebesgue point for ∇v).

The case k = 1, p◦ = n is a classical result due to Stein [48] (see also [29]), and for

k = n, p◦ = 1 the result is due to Dorronsoro [17].

Theorem 4.3 admits the following generalization.

p◦,1(Rn, Rd). Then there
Theorem 4.4 ([31, 32]). Let k, l ∈ {1, . . . , n}, l ≤ k, and v ∈ Wk
exists a Borel set Av,l ⊂ Rn such that Hlp◦(Av,l) = 0 and for any x ∈ Rn\ Av,l the function
v is l-times diﬀerentiable (in the classical Fr´echet–Peano sense) at x, i.e.,

where Tv,l,x(y) is the Taylor polynomial of order l for v centered at x (which is well deﬁned
Hlp◦-a.e. by Theorem 4.3).

5 Proofs of the main results

5.1 Proof of the Luzin type N -property

In this subsection we are going to prove Theorem 2.3 and as a consequence Theorem 1.2.
Now ﬁx n ∈ N, k ∈ {1, . . . , n}, p ∈ [p◦, n] and q ∈ [0, p]. Denote in this subsection

µ = p − q.

Fix also a mapping v ∈ Wk

p◦,1(Rn, Rd). For a set E ⊂ Rn deﬁne the set function

Φ(E) = inf

E⊂Sα DαXα (cid:0)diam Dα(cid:1)µ(cid:2)diam v(Dα)(cid:3)q,

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

where the inﬁmum is taken over all countable families of compact sets {Dα}α∈N such that
with the property

E ⊂Sα Dα. By Theorem 6.1 (see Appendix), Φ(·) is a countably subadditive set-function

Φ(E) = 0 ⇒ (cid:20)Hµ(cid:0)E ∩ v−1(y)(cid:1) = 0

Thus the assertion of Theorem 2.3 amounts to

for Hq-almost all y ∈ Rd(cid:21).

Φ(E) = 0

whenever Hp(E) = 0.
The proof of this follows the ideas of [31].
By a dyadic interval we understand a cubic interval of the form [ k1
2l , kn+1
],
2l
where ki, l are integers. The following assertion is straightforward, and hence we omit its
proof here.

Lemma 5.1. For any n–dimensional cubic interval J ⊂ Rn there exist dyadic intervals
Q1, . . . , Q2n such that J ⊂ Q1 ∪ · · · ∪ Q2n and ℓ(Q1) = · · · = ℓ(Q2n) ≤ 2ℓ(J).

Let {Qα}α∈A be a family of n-dimensional dyadic intervals. We say that the family

{Qα} is regular, if for any n-dimensional dyadic interval Q the estimate

ℓ(Qα)p

(5.5)

ℓ(Q)p ≥ Xα:Qα⊂Q

holds. Since dyadic intervals are either nonoverlapping or contained in one another,
(5.5) implies that any regular family {Qα} must in particular consist of nonoverlapping
intervals.

Lemma 5.2 (see Lemma 2.3 in [13]). Let {Qα} be a family of n–dimensional dyadic
intervals. Then there exists a regular family {Jβ} of n–dimensional dyadic intervals such

n–dimensional dyadic intervals we have if

Remark 5.1. Note that the regularity assumptions in the last theorem are sharp:
n(Rn, Rn)
example, the Luzin N–property fails in general for continuous mappings v ∈ W1
(here k = 1, p◦ = p = n = q, µ = 0), see, e.g., [36]. The sharpness of our assumptions
for general order Sobolev spaces, though not on the Sobolev–Lorentz scale, is also a
consequence of the recent and interesting results in [26]. See also [28] for earlier results
in this direction.

5.2 Dubovitski˘ı theorem for Sobolev mappings
Fix integers k, m ∈ {1, . . . , n}, d ≥ m and a mapping v ∈ Wk
p◦,1(Rn, Rd). Then, by
Theorem 4.3, there exists a Borel set Av such that Hp◦(Av) = 0 and all points of the
complement Rn \ Av are Lp◦-Lebesgue points for the weak gradient ∇v. Moreover, we can
arrange that v is diﬀerentiable (in the classical Fr´echet sense) at every point x ∈ Rn \ Av
with derivative ∇v(x) (so the classical derivative coincides with the precise representative
of the weak gradient at x).

Denote Zv,m = {x ∈ Ω \ Av : rank∇v(x) < m}. Fix a number

Denote in this subsection

such that E ⊂Sα Dα. Note that the case q = q◦, µq = 0 was considered in [31, 32] (see

Before embarking on the detailed proof we make some preliminary observations that
allow us to make a few simplifying assumptions. In view of our deﬁnition of critical set
we have that

Zv,m =[j∈N

{x ∈ Zv,m : |∇v(x)| ≤ j}.

Consequently we only need to prove that Φ(Z ′

v) = 0 for q ∈ (m − 1, q◦), where

Z ′
v = {x ∈ Zv,m : |∇v(x)| ≤ 1}.

For convenience, below we use the notation kfkLp◦,1(I) instead of k1I·fkLp◦,1. The following
lemma contains the main step in the proof of Theorems 2.1 and 2.2.

Lemma 5.4. Let q ∈ [m− 1, q◦). Then for any n-dimensional dyadic interval I ⊂ Rn the
estimate

Φ(Z ′

v ∩ I) ≤ C(cid:0)ℓ(I)µ k∇kvkq

Lp◦,1(I)(cid:1)
Lp◦,1(I) + ℓ(I)µ+m−1 k∇kvkq−m+1

holds, where the constant C depends on n, m, k, d only.

Proof. By virtue of (3.5) it suﬃces to prove that

By Theorem 3.3 (iii) (applied to the case k = l ), our mapping v coincides with a
mapping g ∈ Ck(Rn, Rd) oﬀ an exceptional set of small n–dimensional Lebesgue measure.
This fact, together with Corollary 5.1 and Dubovitski˘ı Theorem A, ﬁnishes the proof of
Theorem 1.1 for the case d = m. But since Theorem 2.1 was not proved for Ck–smooth
mappings5, we have to do this step now.
Lemma 5.5. Let q ∈ (m − 1, q◦) and g ∈ Ck(Rn, Rd). Then

Φg(Zg,m) = 0,

(5.32)

where Φg is calculated by the same formula (5.13) with g instead of v and Zg,m = {x ∈

Proof. We can assume without loss of generality that g has compact support and that
p◦,1(Rn, Rd), hence we can in
|∇g(x)| ≤ 1 for all x ∈ Rn. We then clearly have that g ∈ Wk
particular apply the above results to g. The following assertion plays the key role:

The proof of (∗) is almost the same as that of Lemma 5.4, with evident modiﬁcations
(we need to take the approximation polynomial PI(x) of degree k instead of k − 1, etc.).
By elementary facts of the Lebesgue integration theory, for an arbitrary family of
nonoverlapping n-dimensional dyadic intervals Iα one has

The proof of this estimate is really elementary since now ∇kg is continuous and compactly
supported function, and, consequently, is uniformly continuous and bounded.

in deﬁnitions (5.27), we obtain that Φg(Zg,m) < ε for any ε > 0, hence the sought
conclusion (5.32) follows.

By Theorem 3.3 (iii) (applied to the case k = l ), the investigated mapping v equals a
mapping g ∈ Ck(Rn, Rd) oﬀ an exceptional set of small n–dimensional Lebesgue measure.
This fact together with Lemma 5.5 readily implies

q = m − 1, and afterwards making the shift of indices (m − 1) → m, we obtain the
following key estimate:
Let m ∈ {0, . . . , n − 1}. Then for any n-dimensional dyadic interval I ⊂ Rn the

estimate

we infer from (5.38) that in fact

Next we prove that the sets where rank∇v ≤ m− 1 are negligible in the coarea formula.
Lemma 5.6. The equality

Hn−m(cid:0)Zv,m ∩ v−1(y)(cid:1) = 0 for Hm-almost all y ∈ Rd

holds, where Zv,m = {x ∈ Rn \ Av : rank∇v(x) ≤ m − 1} is the set of m-critical points.
Proof. We apply Theorem 2.1 with the parameters q = m, k = 1, p◦ = n. Then by (2.1)

(5.38)

(5.39)

(5.40)

(5.41)

Hµq(cid:0)Zv,m ∩ v−1(y)(cid:1) = 0 for Hm-almost all y ∈ Rd,

where µq = n− m− k + 1 + (q− m)k = n− m. The last identity taken together with (5.41)
concludes the proof.

In the papers [44, 27] the authors identiﬁed criteria for the validity of the Coarea

formula for Lipschitz mappings. The following result is particularly useful to us.
Theorem 5.1 (see, e.g., Theorem 1.4 in [27]). Let m ∈ {0, 1, . . . , n}, and g ∈ C1(Rn, Rd).
Suppose that the set E ⊂ Rn is measurable and rank∇g(x) ≡ m for all x ∈ E. Assume
also that the set g(E) is Hm-σ-ﬁnite. Then the coarea formula

Hn−m(E ∩ g−1(y)) dHm(y)

(5.42)

ZE

Jmg(x) dx =ZRd

holds, where Jmg(x) denotes the m–Jacobian of g.

Of course, (5.39) and (5.40) are in particular valid also for Ck–smooth mappings.
So from Theorem 5.1 and properties (5.39)–(5.40) we obtain the following result which
surprisingly is new even in this smooth case.

21

Theorem 5.2. Let m ∈ {0, . . . , n} and g ∈ C1(Rn, Rd). Then for any measurable set
E ⊂ Zg,m+1 = {x ∈ Rn : rank∇g(x) ≤ m} the coarea formula

Hn−m(E ∩ g−1(y)) dHm(y)

(5.43)

ZE

Jmg(x) dx =ZRd

holds, where Jg,m(x) again denotes the m–Jacobian of g.

By Theorem 3.3 (iii) (applied to the case k = l = 1 ), the investigated mapping v ∈
W1
n,1(Rn, Rd) coincides with a smooth mapping g ∈ C1(Rn, Rd) oﬀ a set of small n–
dimensional Lebesgue measure. This fact together with Theorems 5.2, 6.1 and Corol-
lary 5.1 easily imply the required assertion of Theorem 2.2.

This section is devoted to the proof of following assertion:

E ⊂Sα Dα.

Theorem 6.1. The above deﬁned set function Φ(·) is countably subadditive and

Φ(E) = 0 ⇒ (cid:20)Hµ(cid:0)E ∩ f −1(y)(cid:1) = 0 for Hq-almost all y ∈ Rd(cid:21).

We start by recalling the following technical fact from [15]:

(6.3)

Proof of Theorem 6.1. The ﬁrst assertion is evident. Let us prove the second one, i.e., the
implication (6.2). Without loss of generality we can assume that f is compactly supported,
and more speciﬁcally that f −1(y) is a compact subset of the closed unit ball B(0, 1) for
every y ∈ Rd \ {0}.
that 0 /∈ f (E) and

Let E ⊂ Rn and assume that Φ(E) = 0. Without loss of generality we can assume

(6.4)

Of course, then E is a Borel set. Suppose that the assertion (6.2) is false, then we can
assume without loss of generality that there exists a set F ⊂ f (E) such that

Hq(F ) > 0

and

∞(cid:0)E ∩ f −1(y)(cid:1) ≥

Unfortunately, we can not assume right now that the set F is Borel, so we need some
careful preparations.

for each y ∈ f (Ej).
Denote further Fkj = f (Ekj). Fix an arbitrary point y with the property

Hµ(Ekj ∩ f −1(y) ) ≤ 1.

Since Ekj is a compact set, the set Ekj ∩ f −1(y) is compact as well. Then it follows
by elementary means that the sets Ekj ∩ f −1(z) lie in the ε-neighborhood of the set
Ekj ∩ f −1(y), where ε ց 0 as z → y, z ∈ f (Ekj). Therefore, there exists δ = δ(y) > 0
such that

∞(Ekj ∩ f −1(z)) ≤ 2

Hence, there exists a relatively open set eFkj ⊂ Fkj (i.e., eFkj is open in the induced topology
∞(Ekj ∩ f −1(y)) ≤ 2}. (6.8)
Since by construction Fkj is a compact set and eFkj is relatively open in Fkj, we conclude
that the set eFkj is Borel (this fact plays an important role here). Further, since Ekj ⊂

∞(Ekj ∩ f −1(y)) ≤ 1} ⊂ eFkj ⊂ {y ∈ Rd : Hµ

Ej, we have for each k ∈ N,

{y ∈ Rd : Hµ

∞(Ej ∩ f −1(y)) ≤ 1} ⊂ {y ∈ Rd : Hµ

∞(Ekj ∩ f −1(y)) ≤ 1} ⊂ eFkj

and therefore,

{y ∈ Rd : Hµ

∞(Ej ∩ f −1(y)) > 2} ⊂ eGj ⊂ {y ∈ Rd : Hµ

{y ∈ Rd : Hµ

Since E ⊂ Ej, we have from (6.5) that F ⊂ {y ∈ Rd : Hµ
j ∈ N, therefore

∞(Ej ∩ f −1(y)) > 1}. (6.11)
∞(Ej ∩ f −1(y)) > 2} ⊂ eGj for all
F ⊂ eG,
∞Tj=1eGj. On the other hand, the second inclusion in (6.11) yields
where we denote eG =
eG ⊂ {y ∈ Rd : Hµ
for each j ∈ N. Since eG is a Borel set and by (6.12), (6.5) the inequalities Hq(eG) ≥
Hq(F ) > 0 hold, by [21, Corollary 4.12] there exists a Borel set G ⊂ eG and a positive

constant b ∈ R such that 0 < Hq(G) < ∞ and

∞(Ej ∩ f −1(y)) > 1}

Hq(G ∩ B(y, r)) ≤ b rq

(6.14)
for any ball B(y, r) = {z ∈ Rd : |z − y| < r} with the center y ∈ G. Of course, by (6.13)

G ⊂ {y ∈ Rd : Hµ

eΦ(·) is a countably subadditive set–function (see, e.g., [20], [25] ).

From (6.4) and (6.14) it follows that

(6.16)

∞Xi=1(cid:0)diam Dij(cid:1)µHq(cid:2)G ∩ f (Dij)(cid:3)
∞Xi=1 eΦ(Dij) ≥ CeΦ(Ej).

6We use the notion of the upper integral since we do not know whether or not the function y 7→

∞(cid:0)S ∩ f −1(y)(cid:1) is measurable.

Consequently, eΦ(Ej) → 0 as j → ∞. On the other hand, from (6.15) and (6.16) we

conclude

eΦ(Ej) ≥

dHq(y) = Hq(G) > 0,

which is the desired contradiction. The proof of the Theorem 6.1 is ﬁnished.

G ⊂ eG such that 0 < Hq(G) < ∞. Put
