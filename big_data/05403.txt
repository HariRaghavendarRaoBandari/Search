Condensation Transition in a conserved generalized interacting Zero Range Process

1Department of Physics, University of Calcutta, 92 Acharya Prafulla Chandra Road, Kolkata 700009, India.

Abdul Khaleque1 and Parongama Sen1

A conserved generalized zero range process is considered in which two sites interact such that
particles hop from the more populated site to the other with a probability p. The steady state
particle distribution function P (n) is obtained using both analytical and numerical methods. The
system goes through several phases as p is varied. In particular, a condensate phase appears for
pl < p < pc, where the bounding values depend on the range of interaction, with pc < 0.5 in general.
Analysis of P (n) in the condensate phase using a known scaling form shows there is universal
behaviour in the short range process while the inﬁnite range process displays non-universality. In
the non-condensate phase above pc, two distinct regions are identiﬁed: pc < p ≤ 0.5 and p > 0.5; a
scale emerges in the system in the latter and this feature is present for all ranges of interaction.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Condensation in various stochastic processes have at-
tracted a lot of attention recently. Jamming in traﬃc
ﬂow [1–3], pathological phases in quantum gravity [4],
condensation of edges in complex networks [5, 6], wealth
condensation in microeconomics [7, 8] and clustering in
shaken granular gases [9] are some well known exam-
ples.
In the condensate phase, a macroscopic fraction
of particles lies in a small region of the system. A non-
equilibrium system in which condensation occurs in real
space is the mass transport model where mass accumu-
lates locally in the condensate phase [10–12]. The zero-
range process (ZRP) which was introduced in [13] as a
mathematical model of interacting particle system is a
special case of the mass transport model.
It has been
one of the most studied models in the literature of non-
equilibrium phenomena in recent years [14–22].

In the ZRP, particles hop from one site to another on a
one dimensional chain of L sites and the hop rate usually
depends only on the occupation number of the departure
sites in the non-interacting case. The particle number N
is given by ρL where ρ is the density and constant in a
conserved system. A condensation can occur if ρ exceeds
a critical value ρc [14], mostly studied in the asymmetric
case. In the condensate phase, all excess particles accu-
mulate on a single site. This is exhibited in the form of a
bump occurring near the tail of the particle distribution
function.
In the cases considered so far, the departure
and destination sites are ﬁxed and are nearest neighbours
apart from some exceptional cases and on graphs [23].

In this paper we have considered a modiﬁed model
with conservation (i.e. particle number is ﬁxed), where
a pair of sites are chosen between which a particle trans-
fer takes place. However, which one will be the depar-
ture/destination site depends on the occupation number
of both sites. Precisely, we consider that the hop will
take place from the more populated site to the other with
probability p and in the reverse direction with probability
1 − p. If the two interacting sites are equally populated,
a hop takes place randomly with equal probability from

either of them. Also, if a site is empty, there is a particle
transfer from the occupied site with probability p while
there is no question of a reverse transfer.
Interactions
have been incorporated in some modiﬁed ZRP and mass
transport models [14, 24–27] where hopping probability
depends on the occupation numbers of two or more sites.
Our model is clearly diﬀerent from such cases as well as
from the non-interacting models. We call this a gener-
alized interacting zero range process; the p = 1/2 limit
corresponds to the conventional zero range process.

In section II, we describe the general features of the
model and a mean-ﬁeld approach is discussed in section
III. Results using numerical simulations are presented in
section IV. In the last section, a short summary and some
discussions have been made.

II. THE MODEL: LIMITS AND GENERAL

FEATURES

The present model is inspired by its analogy to certain
physical problems. In case the hops occur between near-
est neighbours (short range (SR) case), it can be easily
mapped to a traﬃc problem with hard core repulsion,
where particles can move either way. The equivalent dy-
namical rule is movement towards the neighbour located
further with probability p (Fig. 1). Note that this is
simply opposite to the dynamics considered in [28] where
particles move towards their nearest neighbour (and an-
nihilate when they collide). In the model considered in
this paper, for p = 1, the particle will always travel away
from its nearer neighbour so as to avoid a collision. The
p = 1 (p = 0) limit (in the SR model) can also be re-
garded as a system of identically (oppositely) charged
particles. We considered also the long range (LR) ver-
sion of the model where the pair of interacting sites are
chosen randomly.

We intend to obtain the particle distribution function
P (n) as time t → ∞, i.e., the probability that there are n
particles on a site in the steady state for diﬀerent values
of p with a ﬁxed value of ρ.

For the limiting case p = 1, there will be hops to lesser

at n = ρ with a ﬁnite width. On the other hand, for
small p, there will be more transfers from lesser popu-
lated sites leading to a tendency of accumulation of par-
ticles on a single site which corresponds to a condensate
phase. Hence one can expect a transition between the
condensate and non condensate phase at a critical value
of p. The condensate-non-condensate phase transition,
if any, is qualitatively similar to the jamming transition
in the traﬃc model; the condensate phase corresponding
to the jammed phase. Thus the non-condensate phase is
also termed as the ﬂuid phase.

In general, for mass transport models it was found that
in the condensate state, P (n) can be analysed using the
scaling form [10]:

P (n) ∝

where M is related to the excess mass. Our goal will
be to ﬁnd out whether a similar scaling form is valid for
the present case and the value of the exponent γ in the
condensate phase. Results are essentially independent
of the value of ρ apart from trivial scaling factors and
presented for ρ = 5 for all cases.

populated sites always. A steady state will correspond to
all sites having identical number of particles equal to ρ
(ρ ≥ 1) if there were no transfers between equally popu-
lated sites. However, since we allow transfers even in this
case, one may expect the probability P (n) to be peaked

III. MEAN-FIELD APPROACH

Here the transition rates have been assumed to be unity
and t taken to be a dimensionless variable. The upper
limit in the summations is ρL unless otherwise restricted.
The conditions to be satisﬁed by P (n, t) are Pn P (n, t) =
1 (normalisation) and hni = Pn nP (n, t) = ρ (con-
servation) at all times. We have used the notation
P (n, t → ∞) = P (n).

Solving these equations numerically, we calculated
P (n), the steady state value (see Fig. 2). The initial
values P (n, t = 0) are taken to be completely random.
For lower values of p a bump appears at n = O(ρL) indi-
cating the presence of a condensate. A systematic study
of the distribution function for small p, however, is diﬃ-
cult as the tail of the distribution takes very long time to
equilibrate and this leads to accumulation of numerical

errors in solving the diﬀerential equations. At small p,
the bump changes shape as the observation time is in-
creased while for small n, P (n) remains more or less con-
stant even at later times. Although the evidence of the
transition is present in the results as the bump disappears
for larger values of p, the ME results are less reliable for
small p and it is not possible to locate the transition point
very accurately. Nevertheless, one can check whether eq.
(1) is valid here by plotting the rescaled probabilities for
diﬀerent values of L and achieve a data collapse using
trial values of γ.
In Fig. 3, the data for p = 0.05 are
shown where we see that with γ = 0.99± 0.005, the data
collapse is fairly appreciable.

IV. RESULTS USING NUMERICAL

SIMULATIONS

In this section we discuss results obtained using nu-
merical simulation considering both the long range and
short range models. In general, we have taken systems
with size L ≤ 1024 and taken averages over at least two
thousand conﬁgurations. Initially, all the sites are ran-
domly occupied. Asynchronous dynamics have been used
to update the state of the system.

A. Condensate to ﬂuid phase transition

1. Long Range (LR) case

As the master equation (ME) approach poses diﬃculty
to analyse the tail of the distribution for small p, we used
Monte Carlo simulation to calculate P (n). The steady
state results for LR case show clearly the presence of the
bump right from p = 0 up to a value p = pc (see Fig.
4(a)). Simple inspection shows that the transition point
pc beyond which the bump vanishes is close to p = 0.33.
It is possible to analyse P (n) for p < pc and do a scaling
analysis using data for diﬀerent values of L. We ﬁnd that
indeed the scaling form given by (1) is valid with M = cL
as the data for diﬀerent system sizes collapse to a single
curve when an appropriate value of γ is used (see Fig.
5). The proportionality constant c is in general equal to
1 to obtain a good collapse. However, there are some
intricacies involved in this choice which is discussed later
in section V.

The value of γ (Table I) shows a slow decrease with p.
This implies the LR case has a non-universal behaviour.
This non-universality is presumably related to the fact
that the location of the secondary peak in P (n) depends
on p as shown in Fig. 4(a).

The estimate of the transition point can be more ac-

the condensate phase, P (n) has considerably large values
only for n close to zero and ρL. As an approximation,
one can take P (n) to be a double delta function at these
two values, such that

P (n) = Aδ(n) + B

Lγ+1 δ(

n − cL

Lγ

).

(4)

The constants A and B can be found out from the
conditions R P (n)dn = 1 (normalisation condition) and
R nP (n)dn = ρ (ﬁxed average value). This gives

and

A + B/L = 1

Bc = ρ.

In the thermodynamic limit B/L vanishes giving A =
1. Using these values, the ﬂuctuation ph∆n2i =
qhn2i − hni2 equals pρcL − ρ2. Hence to the leading
order, ph∆n2i is O(L1/2) with the proportionality con-
stant equal to √ρc. No p dependence is present here.
Also, we note that for small enough p, c is very close to
ρ as the second bump peaks at ρL very sharply. Hence
in the limit p → 0, ph∆n2i is given by ρL1/2.
On the other hand, in the ﬂuid phase, the ﬂuctuation
should be ﬁnite and hence should either remain constant
or decrease with L. We indeed note from the simulation
results that ph∆n2i increases with L for small p values
while for large values of p, ph∆n2i is independent of L,
shown in Fig. 6(a). We also ﬁnd that ph∆n2i shows a
general variation as ∼ Lα for a ﬁxed value of p. The
value of the exponent is almost constant, α ∼ 0.50, up
to a value of p, then it sharply decreases to zero with p
(see inset of Fig. 6(a)). One can estimate the transition
point pc as the point (approximately) up to which the
ﬂuctuation varies as ∼ L1/2 and we get pc = 0.33 ± 0.02
from this data. The proportionality constant, theoreti-
cally predicted as ρ = 5 for very small p, decreases from
about 4.8 at p = 0 to close to 4.3 at pc. This variation is
not surprising as the value of c depends on p. Hence we
ﬁnd very good agreement with the theoretical prediction
for the exponent α as well as the associated proportion-
ality constant.

We present snapshots at the steady state in support of
the diﬀerent behaviour of the particle distribution func-
tion P (n). We show snapshots for p = 0.05, 0.45 and
0.70. In the ﬁrst case, there is a condensate forming; even
though there are a few sites with ﬁnite occupancy, the
occupancy of the most populated site is order of magni-
tude higher than the others (Fig. 7(a)). For pc < p < 0.5,
there are no such unique site indicating the absence of the
condensate, however, the ﬂuctuation in the occupancy is
appreciable as seen from Fig. 7(b). As p → 1, all sites are
occupied with almost equal number (n ∼ ρ) (Fig. 7(c)).

2. Short Range (SR) case

There are some obvious intrinsic diﬀerences between
the long and the short range processes. For example, in
the extreme case of p = 0, it is expected that many sites
will become unoccupied as a rich-gets-richer strategy is
imposed. However, the condensate will have diﬃculty
to form in the short range model as the sites which are
populated may not interact at all. Hence a large number
of sites, separated by ﬁnite distances, become populated
though none of them have a macroscopically large oc-
cupation number. As a result, the distribution function
does not show a condensate state. Simulation made for
the short range (SR) model shows that this continues up
to a value of p = pl.

Hence in the short range case, only for p & 0.15 and

p . 0.44, P (n) shows a bump near ρL and thus there
is a non-zero lower bound of p = pl for the condensate
to form (see Fig. 8(a) for P (n) at p > pl; and section
IVB for P (n) at p < pl). As in the LR case, the scaling
form (1) is also valid here with M ≃ L in SR (see Fig. 9).
However, in contrast to the long range case, γ is very close
to unity and does not show any systematic dependence
on p (see Table 1) indicating universal behaviour. This is
explained from the fact that the secondary peak positions
are almost independent of p except perhaps very close to
pl ≃ 0.15.

Using the same argument as in the LR case, one can es-
timate pc for the SR case from the data for ph∆n2i. For
the SR case also, ph∆n2i shows system size dependent
behaviour for lower values of p only (see Fig. 6(b)). In
Fig. 6(b) (inset), we show that here also ph∆n2i ∼ Lα
with α very close to 0.50 up to a value of p and shows
an even sharper drop beyond this value. The estimated
transition point is pc = 0.44 ± 0.01. The proportionality
constant here is not sensitive to the value of p and varies
in the range 4.4 ± 0.2 (theoretical prediction is 5). This
is because the secondary peaks in the condensate phase
occur more or less at the same position independent of
p in the SR case. Hence once again good agreement is
obtained with the theoretical estimates.

We also present snapshots in support of the appearance
of the variety of phases. At low values of p, (p < pl), occu-
pied sites cannot interact as they are separated by empty

5

sites. The snapshot shows occupancy at many sites,
mostly separated by one or a few empty sites (Fig. 10(a)).
Hence P (n) does not show condensation for p < pl but
may show a long tail (details in section IVB). In the con-
densed phase pc > p > pl, a ﬁnite fraction of particles
lies in a single site (Fig. 10(b)). Immediately above pc,
the melting of the condensate state is manifested as we
see the majority of particles populating a cluster of sites
slowly disappear in the bulk as p is increased (Figs. 10(c)-
10(e)). For even higher value of p, all sites are almost
equally occupied (n ∼ ρ) as in LR.

decay: S(d) ∝ exp(−λd) for all p (Fig. 11). The decay
becomes sharper as p increases. S(d) has been ﬁtted with
the form ∼ exp(−λx) and λ has been estimated for all
values of p. The exponent λ increases continuously with
p for LR but for SR λ is found to remain rather small
up to pc and it increases rapidly beyond this point in the
SR model (see Fig. 12(b)). This corresponds to having
large intervals below pc. Few occupied sites are found for
pl < p < pc and the variation of λ with p is a quantitative
veriﬁcation of that.

In the condensate phase, number of empty sites is ap-
preciably large while as p → 1, all sites become occupied.
Fraction of empty sites P (0) in the steady state has been
studied for both the long and short range cases (see Fig.
12(a)). An estimate is also available from the ME ap-
proach which gives steady state values for all p for small
n. No special behaviour is noted in P (0) at pc in the
long range model. On the other hand, the short range
case clearly shows a jump in P (0) at pc. Once again the
long range model, expectedly, does not show any special
behaviour.

B. Nature of P (n) in diﬀerent phases: a

comparative picture

In this subsection we present a detailed study of the
functional behaviour of the distribution P (n) in diﬀerent
phases. The behaviour of P (n) in the condensate phase
(pl < p < pc) has already been discussed. Exactly at
pc, the behaviour is expected to be a power law. Since
numerical estimate of pc cannot be exact, one can only
verify this for p close to pc and a reasonably good agree-
ment is indeed found. The entire region p > pc is a ﬂuid
phase. In the short range case, one may also interpret
the p < pl region as a ﬂuid phase as the condensate is
absent. However, at p = 0 the system enters an absorb-
ing (or frozen) state and even for < 0 < p < pl, the
dynamics are quite restricted. We thus identify this re-
gion as a pseudo frozen phase. We note the tendency of
developing a bump at larger values of n as p → pl ≃ 0.15

For 0.5 > p > pc, there is a considerable number of
sites which are near empty. In the SR case, an interesting
feature is noted: the occupied sites form a cluster which
vanishes gradually as p → 0.5 (see snapshots in Figs. 10).
This is a kind of “melting” of the highly occupied site
which exists up to p = pc. The LR case shows no such
features for p > pc; naturally in the globally connected
case, such local correlations cannot exist.

for (a) ME, (b) LR and (c) SR. System size is L = 256 and
density ρ = 5.

Both in the long and short range cases, for p > 0.5,
P (n) shows the presence of a peak (i.e. a most probable
value) indicating the emergence of a scale.
In fact for
p > 0.5, the two models give almost identical results and
the results from ME being more reliable as p increases,
also show very good agreement. Between p = 0.5 and 1,
P (n) interpolates between a perfectly exponential and a
Gaussian form.

P (n) decreases exponentially with n at p = 0.5 for all
the three cases (Fig. 14). The ﬁtting form is A exp(−bx).
The exponents are (1) ME: A = 0.169, b = 0.185; (2)
LR: A = 0.166, b = 0.181; (3) SR: A = 0.119, b = 0.154.
Hence although the qualitative behaviour is independent
of the range, the value of the exponent b is case sensitive.
We also note the very good agreement of the results ob-
tained from ME and LR.

For large values of p (p > 0.5), P (n) can be ﬁtted to
a Gaussian form for ME, LR and SR methods (Fig. 15).

that the actual values of P (n) for LR and SR diﬀer ap-
preciably even for small n for a ﬁxed value of p in the
condensate phase. The results from the ME approach,
as mentioned before, does not show perfect agreement
with the LR results at larger values of n due to computa-
tional diﬃculties at low p values. But in the ﬂuid phase,
there is very good agreement of the values of P (n) for all
the three methods (Fig. 16(b)).

V. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS

In summary, we have studied a general form of the
the well known zero range process. A condensate phase
is obtained keeping the density constant and tuning the
hopping probability p. A variety of rich behaviour is
observed as p is increased; the system passes through
diﬀerent phases for 0 ≤ p < pl, pl < p ≤ pc, pc <
p < 0.5 and beyond p = 0.5. Severals snapshots are
presented which show the system conﬁguration in the
diﬀerent phases.

Naively one would expect pc, the point below which
a condensate phase forms, to be equal to 0.5 as hop-
ping from lesser populated sites are more probable below
p = 0.5. However we get pc < 0.5 for both the SR and LR
models. This is due to the reason that when an empty site
is involved, the other site will always get less populated,
which makes the probability of forming the condensate
lesser. Why the short range process has a higher pc com-
pared to the long range case may be explained from the
fact that when an occupied site becomes isolated in the
former, no more transfer takes place from it.

Our results are mainly based on ﬁnite size scaling anal-
ysis. The choice of parameters for the data collapse of
P (n) is a tricky question and we have taken the values
which give the manifestly best collapses. In particular, if
the value of the exponent γ is close to unity the data col-
lapses for the secondary bump in P (n) are not sensitive
to the value of c for obvious reasons. However, for the
long range case, γ deviates from unity at larger values of
p and the best collapses are obtained for c = 1 in general.
Hence, we have used c = 1 everywhere in the plots of the
data collapse.

The transition points as well as the exponent associ-
ated with the scaling function for the particle number
distribution function depend on the range of interaction.
Only the short range case shows universality. Excellent
agreement is reached for the analytical and simulation
methods (for LR) when reliable steady state values can
be obtained while solving the master equation numeri-
cally. The model shows range independent behaviour for
p > 0.5 where a typical scale emerges. P (n) is expo-
nential for p = pc while it can be approximated by a
Gaussian form deep inside the ﬂuid phase.
