KINETIC SIMULATIONS OF THE LOWEST-ORDER UNSTABLE MODE OF RELATIVISTIC

MAGNETOSTATIC EQUILIBRIA

ABSTRACT

We present the results of particle-in-cell numerical pair plasma simulations of relativistic 2D mag-
netostatic equilibria known as the “ABC” ﬁelds. In particular, we focus on the lowest-order unstable
conﬁguration consisting of two minima and two maxima of the magnetic vector potential. Breaking
of the initial symmetry leads to exponential growth of the electric energy and to the formation of two
current layers, which is consistent with the picture of “X-point collapse” ﬁrst described by Syrovatskii.
Magnetic reconnection within the layers heats a fraction of particles to very high energies. After the
saturation of the linear instability, the current layers are disrupted and the system evolves chaotically,
diﬀusing the particle energies in a stochastic second-order Fermi process leading to the formation of
power-law energy distributions. The power-law slopes harden with the increasing mean magnetiza-
tion, but they are signiﬁcantly softer than those produced in simulations initiated from Harris-type
layers. The maximum particle energy is proportional to the mean magnetization, which is attributed
partly to the increase of the eﬀective electric ﬁeld and partly to the increase of the acceleration time
scale. We describe in detail the evolving structure of the dynamical current layers, and report on the
conservation of magnetic helicity. These results can be applied to highly magnetized astrophysical
environments, where ideal plasma instabilities trigger rapid magnetic dissipation with eﬃcient particle
acceleration and ﬂares of high-energy radiation.

1. INTRODUCTION

Observations of high-energy photons from certain
astrophysical sources — such as blazars, gamma-ray
bursts, pulsars, etc. — often reveal dramatic energy
dissipation and eﬃcient particle acceleration on very
short time scales. Examples include rapid gamma-
ray variability of blazars (e.g., Aharonian et al. 2007;
Aleksi´c et al. 2011; Saito et al. 2013; Hayashida et al.
2015), radio galaxies (e.g., Aleksi´c et al. 2014), gamma-
ray bursts (e.g., Abdo et al. 2009), and the Crab pul-
sar wind nebula (Tavani et al. 2011; Abdo et al. 2011;
Buehler et al. 2012). In many cases, the environment of
these events is thought to be a highly magnetized colli-
sionless plasma — AGN jets, pulsar wind nebulae, etc.
This suggests scenarios involving eﬃcient localized dis-
sipation of magnetic energy allowing for rapid particle
acceleration (e.g., Begelman et al. 2008; Giannios et al.
2009; Nalewajko et al. 2011; Uzdensky et al. 2011;
Clausen-Brown & Lyutikov 2012).

It is important to consider the astrophysically re-
alistic situations leading to eﬃcient magnetic dissipa-
tion. The foremost requirement is the localized re-
versal of the magnetic ﬁeld lines. Using the Harris-
type current layer as initial condition presumes a
highly synchronized global reversal of the magnetic
ﬁeld polarity with a steady supply of magnetized
plasma. Such initial condition includes a rather arbi-
trary structure on kinetic scales, the impact of which

can probably be neglected only in suﬃciently large
simulations (Sironi & Spitkovsky 2014; Guo et al. 2014;
Werner et al. 2016). In the context of pulsar wind nebu-
lae, global reversals can be readily realized in the equa-
torial striped wind (Coroniti 1990; Lyubarsky & Kirk
2001; Kirk & Skjæraasen 2003), and their consequences
for particle acceleration and high-energy emission
are actively investigated (Sironi & Spitkovsky 2011;
Baty et al. 2013; Zrake 2015).
In the context of as-
trophysical jets,
it has long been hypothesized that
such global reversals can take place (e.g., Lovelace et al.
1997), however, a convincing demonstration of such sce-
nario is yet to be made. The alternative is that magnetic
dissipation is triggered by jet instabilities, in particular
by the current-driven kink modes (Begelman 1998). In
such a case, interactions of large-scale magnetic struc-
tures (eddies) are expected to create many transient lo-
calized current sheets that facilitate magnetic dissipation
(O’Neill et al. 2012; Mizuno et al. 2012).

Currently, most investigations focus on relativistic
magnetic reconnection, and indeed, great progress has
been made over the past few years, in large part due
to increasingly powerful direct kinetic plasma simula-
tions. When starting from a uniform Harris-type cur-
rent layer, it has been convincingly demonstrated that
relativistic reconnection leads to very eﬃcient particle
acceleration. The resulting energy distributions can be
characterized as power-laws N (γ) ∝ γ−p with broad
cut-oﬀs, and the slope p depending mainly on the back-
ground plasma magnetization σ. In the limit of σ ≫ 1,
the energy distributions become extremely hard, with
p ≃ 1 − 1.2 (Sironi & Spitkovsky 2014; Guo et al. 2014;
Werner et al. 2016).
Such hard energy distributions
mean that the maximum particle energy is limited by

2

Nalewajko et al.

the initial average magnetic energy per particle. Indeed,
for suﬃciently large systems, the characteristic cut-oﬀ
energy scales like γc ∝ σ (Werner et al. 2016).
However, the dissipation eﬃciency of relativistic recon-
nection is limited by reconnection rates being of order
O(0.1) (e.g., Liu et al. 2015). Our group proposed an
idea of magnetoluminescence, a generic dissipation pro-
cess that allows for rapid and eﬃcient conversion of elec-
tromagnetic energy into radiation (Blandford et al. 2014,
2015). With this end, we started to explore a range of
novel magnetostatic equilibria.

Recently, some of us investigated a class of unstable
magnetostatic equilibria known as the “Arnold-Beltrami-
Childress” (ABC) ﬁelds, using relativistic magnetohy-
drodynamics (RMHD) and force-free electrodynamics
(FF) codes (East et al. 2015). Here, we present the ﬁrst
results of the subsequent investigation of these equilibria
with the kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) code Zeltron. The
simulations presented here are two-dimensional, with
pair plasma, and they focus on the lowest-order unstable
mode. Nevertheless, we obtained a very rich physical pic-
ture including the evolution of the sheared current layers,
regular and stochastic modes of particle acceleration, and
rapid dissipation of magnetic energy.

In Section 2, we deﬁne the initial conﬁguration and its
implementation in the Zeltron code. In Section 3, we
present the results including the evolution of total en-
ergy components, conservation of magnetic helicity, the
evolving structure of the current layers, evolution of the
particle energy distribution, and analysis of individual
energetic particles. Our results are discussed in Section
4, and our conclusions are presented in Section 5.

2. SIMULATION SETUP

We performed two-dimensional PIC numerical simu-
lations using the Zeltron code4 (Cerutti et al. 2013).
The core algorithms include a Finite-Diﬀerence-Time-
Domain (FDTD) method for advancing the electromag-
netic ﬁelds on staggered grids (Yee 1966), the “Boris
push” for advancing the particles, a smoothing ﬁltering
of the electric ﬁelds, and a Poisson solver for matching
the electric ﬁelds with the charge density. The radiation
reaction implemented in this code was not used in these
simulations.

Our simulations proceed from smooth magnetostatic
equilibria. They are kinetic generalizations of the MHD
states whose gas pressure is uniform and Lorentz force
j × B vanishes. We focus on force-free equilibria satis-
fying the Beltrami condition ∇ × B = αB, where α is
a constant.
In the present study we use the following
magnetic ﬁeld

Bx = B0 [sin(α0(x + y)) + sin(α0(x − y))] /√2 ,
By = B0 [sin(α0(x − y)) − sin(α0(x + y))] /√2 ,
Bz = B0 [cos(α0(x + y)) − cos(α0(x − y))] ,

(1)

where α0 = 2π/L for linear domain size L. This state
has a wavelength that is smaller by a factor √2 than the
domain scale, and resembles the conventional ABC mag-
netic ﬁelds we used in previous studies, but has been ro-
tated by 45◦. Translational symmetry of this state along

4 http://benoit.cerutti.free.fr/Zeltron/

z is enforced throughout the evolution by the “2.5D” sim-
ulation scheme. This state contains two minima and two
maxima of the out-of-plane vector potential Az. Those
extrema are centered on helical ﬂux tubes aligned with
the z-axis, which are linearly unstable to pairwise coales-
cence instability as we reported in East et al. (2015). As
such coalescence moves plasma toward a lower energy
(longer wavelength) magnetic conﬁguration, the initial
state must possess a non-zero “magnetostatic free en-
ergy”. That is, by our deﬁnition, the magnetic energy
that could be removed while the frozen-in MHD con-
dition — E = B × β, hence E · B = 0 — is main-
tained over all but inﬁnitesimal volumes. Such evolution
leads to minimization of the magnetic energy as con-
strained by the global magnetic helicity invariant in the
sense of Taylor (1974). For general states having a wave-
length λ0, the theoretical free energy fraction is in general

fB,0 = 1− λ0/L, which has the value 1− 1/√2 ≈ 0.29 for

our setup. In other words, 29% of the magnetic energy of
our initial condition could be used to energize particles
if magnetic helicity is conserved.

The current density j = −(c/√2L)B of the setup in

Equation (1) is realized by endowing particles with a lo-
cally anisotropic momentum distribution, which we fac-
torize into independent energy and angular parts as

f (u) d3u = f1(γ, Θ)(cid:18) 1 + a1µ

2

(cid:19) dγ dµ ,

(2)

where u = γβ is the dimensionless particle momentum,
γ = (1 + u2)1/2 is the dimensionless particle energy
(Lorentz factor), β = v/c is the dimensionless parti-
cle velocity. Function f1(γ, Θ) is the Maxwell-J¨uttner
energy distribution for dimensionless temperature Θ =
kT /mc2; µ = cos θ, where θ is the polar angle mea-
sured from the unit vector aligned with the required local
current density vector. Parameter a1 ≤ 1 is the dipole
moment of the local angular distribution of paricle mo-
menta, which determines the local average drifting speed
hβdi = (a1/3)hβi, where hβi is the average speed that is
a function of Θ.
For pair plasma, the total current density module is
j = ecnhβdi, where n is the number density of both
electrons and positrons. Combining this with previous
relations, we obtain an expression for equilibrium value
of the pair number density:

n =

3√2B0
2e˜a1 hβi L

,

(3)

where ˜a1 = (B0/B)a1 ≤ 1/2 is a constant equal to
a characteristic value of the dipole moment (note that
a1(x, y) ∝ B(x, y)). The upper limit imposed on the
dipole moment introduces a lower limit on the particle
number density, and hence an upper limit on the mag-
netization of the simulated system. The characteristic
value of the “cold magnetization” can be expressed as:

σcold =

B2
0

4πnmec2 =

6√2π (cid:18) L
˜a1 hβi

ρ0(cid:19) ,

(4)

where ρ0 = mec2/(eB0) is the nominal gyroradius.
Hence, for the maximum value of the dipole moment, the
magnetization scales linearly with the system size (L/ρ0).

Parameters of the simulation runs. Two characteristic magnetization values are reported: σcold and σhot. Parameter ˜a1 is the

characteristic constant of the dipole moment of particle momentum distribution. Parameter τ is the e-folding growth rate of the total

electric energy. Parameter ǫdiss = fB/fB,0 describes the global eﬃciency of magnetic energy conversion, where fB = 1 − EB,ﬁn/EB,ini is

the measured conversion eﬃciency, and fB,0 = 1 − 2−1/2 = 29.3% is the theoretical expectation for relaxation to the isotropic Taylor

state. Parameters fn and fe describe the number and energy fractions contained in the high-energy particle distribution tail at ct/L ≃ 10.

Parameter p is the index of the power-law energy distribution tail estimated at ct/L ≃ 10. Parameter γmax is the maximum particle

energy measured at the 10−3 level of the normalized energy distribution at ct/L ≃ 10.

For isotropic distributions, the cold magnetization is re-

0/(4πw), where w = (cid:10)γ(1 + β2/3)(cid:11) nmec2 is
σhot = B2
the speciﬁc enthalpy. However, one should note that
even the initial magnetization is not uniform due to the
non-uniformity of |B|.
We have performed several simulations for diﬀerent
values of (L/ρ0) and ˜a1, as reported in Table 1. Com-
mon parameter values are B0 = 1 G and Θ = 1. The
numerical resolution is ∆x = ∆y = ρ0/2.56, and the
total number of particles per cell is 128.

3. RESULTS

3.1. Snapshot maps

Figure 1 shows the distribution of magnetic ﬁeld com-
ponent Bz, particle number density n, and average par-
ticle Lorentz factor hγi at several time steps for Run
s55L1600. The initial condition includes two maxima
(red) and two minima (blue) of Bz, which correspond to
the extrema of the magnetic vector potential Az ∝ Bz.
By ct/L = 3.9, the initial symmetry of the setup is bro-
ken, as can be seen on the particle number density map.
Two current layers form, one in the center of the simula-
tion domain, and one in the corners. By ct/L = 5.4, the
current layers grow in length, they accelerate particles to
high energies, and they undergo a minor tearing insta-
bility. This process can be characterized as the “X-point
collapse” ﬁrst investigated by Syrovatskii (1966). The
sharp current layers seen at ct/L = 5.4 are disrupted, and
the subsequent evolution of the magnetic domains pro-
ceeds through a series of oscillations forming complex,
chaotic substructures. However, in the ﬁnal stage, we
observe a clear separation between a dense cold plasma
located along the magnetic domain boundaries, and a
dilute hot plasma partially ﬁlling the domain interiors.

3.2. Evolution of total energy

Figure 2 shows the time evolution of the main compo-
nents of the total energy: magnetic, kinetic (including
thermal), and electric. The total energy in our simula-
tions is conserved at the level better than 10−3, improv-
ing with increasing magnetization. All simulations (ex-
cept for s55L3200) are run for at least 10 light-crossing

time scales, at which point the evolution of the total en-
ergy components is largely complete. Parameters of the
initial conﬁguration determine the characteristic magne-
tization value, and hence the initial energy shared be-
tween the magnetic ﬁeld and particles.

The global eﬃciency of magnetic dissipation is calcu-
lated as ǫdiss = fB/fB,0, where fB = 1 − EB,ﬁn/EB,ini,
EB,ini is the total magnetic energy at t = 0, and EB,ﬁn
is the total magnetic energy at ct/L ≃ 10. As we report
in Table 1, ǫdiss ≈ 80% for all simulation runs. This in-
dicates that magnetic relaxation toward the Taylor min-
imum is eﬀectively complete by that time. We note here
that in 2.5D, the energy of the most relaxed state gen-
erally exceeds the Taylor minimum energy due to con-
straints on the change of magnetic topology that were
not considered by Taylor, who intended to characterize
fully 3D evolution. Nevertheless, Zrake & East (2016)
found the additional constraints became signiﬁcant only

when λ0 ≪ L. Since we have λ0 = L/√2, nearly com-

plete relaxation to the Taylor minimum energy state is
to be expected in the cases presented here. We also esti-
mate the peak e-folding time scale of the total magnetic
energy as ∼ 2.5L/c.
The initial electric energy, at the level of ∼ 10−4 of the
total energy, is determined by the residual charge den-
sity due to the ﬁnite number of particles per cell. At
ct/L ≃ 3 − 4, the electric energy begins to grow expo-
nentially. By ct/L ≃ 5 − 6, the growth of the electric
energy saturates at the level of ∼ 0.1 of the total energy.
At about the same time, the magnetic energy decreases
sharply, and the kinetic energy begins to increase. There
is no simple energy transformation between magnetic and
kinetic forms. Instead, the electric energy begins to os-
cillate, and this oscillation is damping over many light-
crossing time scales. These oscillations are reﬂected more
clearly in the evolution of the magnetic energy compo-
nent, rather than of the kinetic component.

We have also calculated the evolution of non-ideal elec-
tric ﬁeld parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld EkB = E · B/|B|.
Figure 2 shows that the growth of the non-ideal electric
energy is negligible when compared with the growth of
the total electric energy. For low magnetizations it is dif-
ﬁcult to distinguish the total non-ideal component from
the noise. In fact, non-ideal regions form distinct com-

pact spatial structures, while most of the domain volume
is consistent with ideal MHD at all times.

We have measured the growth rates of the total elec-
tric energy during the linear instability phase as e-folding
time τ . Figure 3 shows the dependence of cτ /L on
the mean magnetization σhot. For each value of σhot,
the growth rate increases systematically with the do-
main size, which suggests that we do not achieve a com-
plete convergence. Considering only the growth rates
measured for the largest simulation for each magnetiza-
tion value, we ﬁtted them with the following function
cτ (σhot)/L = a/vA(sσhot), where vA(σ) = [σ/(1 + σ)]1/2
is the Alfv´en speed. For the scaling parameters, we found
a ≃ 0.13 and s ≃ 0.21.

3.3. Magnetic helicity conservation

Zrake & East (2016) studied the decay of magnetic
turbulence in the force-free limit in both 2D and 3D.
They investigated the conservation of magnetic helic-

ity H = R A · BdV , which is formally broken only by
the presence of regions with non-ideal electric ﬁeld, as
˙H = −2R E · BdV (e.g. Brandenburg et al. 2015).
In
both 2D and in 3D, they reported that total magnetic he-
licity H was indeed conserved to a high precision, which
improved with resolution. They also found that in 2D,
H could be decomposed into a continuous distribution
dH/dAz, each value of which is a separate invariant.
Here we verify these ﬁndings in 2D PIC simulations for
the ﬁrst time.

totic value measured in FF simulations (East et al. 2015).

In Figure 4, we show that total magnetic helicity is con-
served at the level better than 1%, improving with the
decreasing particle momentum dipole moment ˜a1. As we
will demonstrate later on, smaller dipole moment allows
for higher particle density and better screening of the
electric ﬁelds. Consequently, the volume fraction of the
non-ideal ﬁeld regions decreases, and this may explain
better conservation of the magnetic helicity, in line with
the results of Zrake & East (2016) in the force-free limit.
In Figure 4, we also show that while dH/dAz is well con-
served for all values of Az, magnetic energy is dissipated
during the linear instability phase for all values of Az.

3.4. Structure of the current layers

Two current layers are formed during the late stages
of the instability, at 4 . ct/L . 5.5. They appear as
thin structures characterized by high density and high
average particle energy, they grow in length and undergo
tearing instability until they are disrupted. These are
also regions where non-ideal parallel electric ﬁelds are
present, with E · B 6= 0, and hence they enable eﬃcient
particle acceleration.
Since the current layers are not present in the initial
conﬁguration, it is interesting to characterize their per-
pendicular structure and evolution. To this end, we ﬁrst
determined the exact location and orientation of the lay-
ers by ﬁtting a two-dimensional Gaussian model to the
spatial distribution of the average particle energy. The
time range when this can be done robustly is limited —
for ct/L < 4 the current layers are not detectable, and for
ct/L & 5.5 the current layers bend and eventually disap-
pear. We introduce a local coordinate system with paral-
lel/perpendicular vectors measured along/across the ma-
jor axis of the current layer. As the location and orienta-
tion of the current layers changes slowly, this is repeated
at every timestep of interest. Next, we calculated perpen-
dicular proﬁles of various parameters across the current
layer centroid. These proﬁles are shown in Figure 5 at 4
diﬀerent times to illustrate a fairly complex evolution of
the current layer.

The density proﬁle develops a narrow spike, and the
average particle energy proﬁle shows a similar but some-

what broader structure. On the other hand, the cur-
rent density component jz shows a more complex proﬁle
with a narrow core and broader wings. This appears to
be a combination of the narrow density proﬁle with the
broad proﬁle of the z-component of the drifting velocity.
We also observe a small component of alternating paral-
lel current jkl on the scale comparable with the velocity
structure. This current is of opposite sign to the back-
ground in-plane current that was already present in the
initial conﬁguration. Evolution of magnetic ﬁeld involves
a gradual steepening of the parallel component Bkl, and
a systematic increase of the out-of-plane component Bz.
The electric ﬁeld increases systematically in all compo-
nents. It is interesting that the component Ez remains
very uniform in the process. When we subtracted the
ideal ﬁeld contribution E′
z = Ez − (hβi × B)z, we found
that E′
z ≃ EkB. The non-ideal ﬁeld component peaks in
the middle of the layer, and has thickness scale compa-
rable to the vz structure.

We ﬁtted the perpendicular proﬁles of particle number
density n, average particle energy hγi, and E · B with
Gaussian models with uniform background. In Figure 6,
we show the evolution of the amplitudes and perpendicu-
lar dispersions of the three parameters. This reveals the
complex structure of the current layer, with the three pa-
rameters characterized by diﬀerent thickness scales. The
general trend in time is an increase in the amplitudes
of all three parameters, the thinning of the density and
average energy proﬁles, and the broadening of the E · B
proﬁle. The amplitudes of the average particle energy
grow exponentially in time as long as we can measure
their proﬁle, with the growth rate increasing systemat-
ically with the magnetization σhot. On the other hand,
the amplitudes of E · B appear to grow linearly in time,
and the growth rate is similar for σhot = 2.7, 5.5. The
width scales of the density and temperature proﬁles con-
verge to a value ∼ 5ρ0, roughly independent of σhot. The
diﬀerence between the width scales measured for the den-
sity and temperature proﬁles is probably not signiﬁcant.
However, the width scale of the E · B clearly depends
on and increases with σhot. We suggest that the width
scale of the density and temperature proﬁles corresponds
roughly to the plasma skin depth de, and that the width
scale of the E · B region corresponds to the typical gy-
roradius of particles heated in the layer ρ ≃ hγi ρ0.
We also calculated the volume-weighted distribution
functions for key scalar quantities |E|/|B| and |E · B|.
Figure 7 shows the 99 percentile values as functions of
simulation time. The values of |E|/|B| consistently reach
the level of ≃ 0.7, independently of the setup parameters,
at about the time of linear instability saturation. The sit-
uation with the |E· B| values is less clear, with a number
of sharp peaks observed at diﬀerent times. The smallest
values |E · B| ∼ 0.03B2
0 are recorded for Run s14L1600,
which is qualitatively consistent with the results shown
in Figure 6. For other runs, the peak values are in the
range |E · B| ∼ (0.08 − 0.12)B2
0.

ulation time. The distributions are normalized to the

tribution begins to evolve at ct/L ≃ 4 (blue) in a period
of rapid and regular (linear) energization of a relatively
small fraction of all particles. The uniformity of the indi-
vidual distributions on the log-log plot suggests an expo-
nential growth of both the maximum particle energy and
the number fraction of participating particles. For the
case of Run s55L1600, this acceleration phase is eﬃcient
enough to form a second peak of the momentum distri-
bution. The linear acceleration phase eventually ceases,
and the subsequent non-linear evolution of the momen-

tum distribution leads to a gradual formation of a power-
law. The “valley” between the initial Maxwellian com-
ponent and the high-energy bump is promptly leveled.
The maximum particle energy increases slowly but sys-
tematically in several steps corresponding to the global
oscillation of the merged magnetic domains.

We have roughly estimated the index p of the power-
law tail of the distribution N (u) ∝ u−p for each simula-
tion at ct/L ∼ 10. The values are reported for selected
runs in Figure 8. There is a clear trend of p increas-
ing with σhot, from p ≃ 3.5 for σhot = 0.7 to p ≃ 2.5
for σhot = 5.5. We have not attempted to measure the
power-law index rigorously as a function of the simula-
tion time, as accurate automated decomposition of the
distribution function requires very complicated modeling
(Werner et al. 2016).

Instead, we investigate what is the fraction of all parti-
cles contained in the high-energy tail by subtracting the
low-energy Maxwellian component. In Figure 9, we plot
as functions of simulation time: the fraction of the par-
ticle number fn, the fraction of the particle energy fe,
and the maximum particle energy γmax, deﬁned formally
at the level of u2N (u) = 10−3 for the normalized distri-
butions. During the linear acceleration phase, both fn,
fe and γmax grow roughly exponentially with time.

the non-linear phase, the growth becomes much slower,
although it does not fully saturate before ct/L = 10,
especially for higher values of σhot.

The values of fn, fe and γmax at ct/L ≃ 10 for all
simulations are reported in Table 1 and plotted in Fig-
ure 10. The number fraction ranges from fn ≃ 0.03 for
σhot = 0.7 to fn ≃ 0.17 for σhot = 5.5. The corre-
sponding values of the energy fraction are fe ≃ 0.11 and
fe ≃ 0.59. Both fn and fe appear to scale with the
magnetization like σ3/4, with the exception of the high-
est σ value, although simulations with even greater σ are
needed to verify this scaling. In any case, this trend could
not continue to very high values of σ, as fn, fe < 1. The
ratio fe/fn, corresponding to the ratio of average parti-
cle energies hγinth / hγitot, shows a slight increase from
fe/fn ≃ 3.3 for σhot = 0.7 to fe/fn ≃ 3.7 for σhot = 5.5.
The maximum particle energy ranges from γmax ≃ 100
for σhot = 0.7 to γmax ≃ 800 for σhot = 5.5, and is con-
sistent with a linear dependence on σ.

3.6. Individual particle histories

At the beginning of each simulation, we randomly se-
lected 105 individual particles in order to record their de-
tailed histories. We will now use this information in order

to better understand particle acceleration in the linear
stage of the simulation. In Figure 11, we show a sample
of particle energy histories γ(t) for particles that obtain
the highest energies at ct/L = 10. For every particle,
this reveals a sharp acceleration episode during the satu-
ration of the linear instability. Now we ask the question,
whether the diﬀerence in the ﬁnal energy values obtained
by these most energetic particles for each simulation is
due to stronger eﬀective value of the parallel electric ﬁeld,
or rather due to longer acceleration time scale. To this
end, we have analyzed the energy histories γ(t), identify-
ing episodes [t1 : t2] of the largest monotonic energy gain
∆γ = γ(t2)−γ(t1). We applied a mild smoothing to γ(t),
and we excluded episodes with γ(t1) & 0.2γmax. Then,
we calculated the mean electric ﬁeld accelerating the par-
ticle from hEi /B0 = ∆γ/(ω0∆t), where ∆t = t2− t1 and
ω0 = c/ρ0.
In Figure 12, we show the distribution of hEi /B0 vs.
c∆t/L for three simulations with diﬀerent magnetization
values, indicating also the ﬁnal particle energy γﬁn at
ct/L = 10. For each simulation, there is a considerable
spread in the values of hEi and ∆t calculated for indi-
vidual energetic particles. While hEi and ∆t determine
the energy gain ∆γ for the main acceleration episode,

there is also a substantial scatter between ∆γ and γﬁn.
The mean values of hEi /B0 are 0.053, 0.071, 0.067 for
σhot = 1.4, 2.7, 5.5, respectively, and the corresponding

mean values of c∆t/L are 0.32, 0.39, 0.59. With this,
we can account for a factor of ≃ 2.4 diﬀerence between
the maximum particle energy between σhot = 1.4 and
σhot = 5.5, while according to Table 1 the diﬀerence
between γmax values for these simulations is by factor
3.1. The diﬀerence appears to be both due to increase
in typical electric ﬁeld strength between σhot = 1.4 and
σhot = 2.7, as well as due to longer acceleration time
scale between σhot = 2.7 and σhot = 5.5.

4. DISCUSSION

Simulating force-free magnetostatic equilibria oﬀers a
new approach for studying relativistic magnetic dissipa-
tion, an alternative to simulating the Harris-type current
layers. A major conceptual advantage of this approach
is that there are no current layers or any structures on
the kinetic scale in the initial plasma conﬁguration. The
formation of current layers results from the saturation
of an ideal plasma instability, and this rapidly creates
conditions for eﬃcient particle acceleration. The most
energetic particles follow the evolving current layers un-
til they disintegrate on the dynamical time scale, and
afterwards they interact chaotically with the slowly de-
caying turbulence.

The initial conﬁguration consists of two positive and
two negative domains of magnetic vector potential Az ∝
Bz. These symmetrically interlocked domains attract
each other and hence they remain in an unstable equi-
librium until the particle distribution noise breaks the
positional symmetry. This triggers an exponential in-
crease in the bulk plasma velocities β, and hence an ex-
ponential increase in the ideal electric ﬁelds E = B × β.
Figure 2 shows that this instability is not seen in the
time evolution of the global non-ideal electric energy.
The e-folding growth rate τ of the total electric energy
is measured to scale with the mean hot magnetization
σhot roughly like cτ (σhot)/L ≃ 0.13/vA(0.21σhot). In the
limit of σhot ≫ 1, this is in excellent agreement with the
value cτ /L ≃ 0.127 (see Figure 3) measured in the FF
simulations (East et al. 2015).
The origin of the current layers can be traced to the
converging motion of two magnetic domains resulting in
a pile-up of particles at the magnetic null points. The

exponential increase in the plasma velocity creates an
exponentially increasing ﬂux of particles forced into the
current layers. This driven reconnection is in contrast to
the undriven reconnection resulting from relaxed Harris-
type current layers, where magnetic diﬀusion regions are
characterized by low plasma density. The current layers
in our simulations systematically grow in length, they
become hotter and thinner, and they are subject to only
mild tearing mode instability. We observe that around
the saturation moment of the ideal instability the inﬂow
of plasma into the current layer is interrupted, and the
current layer is rapidly disintegrated by internal motions
of the newly formed magnetic domain encompassing the
layer.

Throughout the evolution of the current layers, we ob-
serve a systematic increase and smooth structure across
the layer of the total electric ﬁeld. This ﬁeld origi-
nated outside the current layers from the motions of ideal
plasma as E = B× β. In the ideal MHD limit, such ﬁeld
should vanish in the middle of the current layer, and we
would strictly expect that E · B = 0. The ideal MHD
condition is obviously violated inside the current layer,
and E · B is dominated by EzBz. The smooth structure
of the Ez component suggests that it is advected into

the layer from outside, rather than created locally in a
separate process. The thickness scale of the E· B 6= 0 re-
gion is signiﬁcantly larger than the thickness scale of the
particle density pile-up, moreover, it is systematically in-
creasing with the simulation time. This additional thick-
ness scale is roughly of the order of the gyroradius cor-
responding to the mean particle energy inside the layer,
and it can be seen imprinted into the proﬁle of the current
density. The Vlasov momentum equation dictates that
for each particle species the following must be satisﬁed:
qn(E·B) = Bi(∂Ui/∂t+∂Pij/∂xj), where U = mnhγvi
is the momentum density, and Pij = mnhγvivji is the
pressure tensor. We have checked that in general the
pressure gradients do not support the E · B, and hence
the particle momentum density has to increase, i.e., par-
ticles are collectively heated in the E · B 6= 0 regions.
The particle energy distributions evolve from the ini-
tial relativistic Maxwell-J¨uttner to form a high-energy
power-law tail on the time scale of ∼ 10L/c in two
stages.
In the ﬁrst, linear stage, particles are heated
by regular electric ﬁelds in the linearly growing current
layers. These particles produce a distinct high-energy
bump in the energy distribution, with the number of
heated particles and their maximum energy increasing

Kinetic simulations of magnetostatic equilibria

exponentially with time. In the second, non-linear stage,
particles energized in the linear stage become detached
from the magnetic potential, and they interact chaoti-
cally with secondary current layers arising in the slowly
damped turbulent plasma motions, diﬀusing in the en-
ergy space. The power-law distributions N (u) ∝ u−p
arise in the non-linear stage, however, their indices ap-
pear to be determined already in the linear stage. They
can be robustly predicted by the ratio of the two dis-
tribution peaks at the saturation moment of the linear
instability, or in other words, by the energy fraction of
particles interacting with the current layers in the linear
stage.

We showed that the acceleration process in the linear
stage is very regular with both the maximum particle en-
ergy and the number fraction of the high-energy particles
increasing exponentially with time. On the other hand,
we showed that individual particles are accelerated lin-
early in time, as if subjected to a roughly constant value
of Ekv. The exponential growth of the number fraction
of high-energy particles can be related to the exponen-
tial growth of the ﬂux of particles joining the current
layer. The exponential growth of the maximum parti-
cle energy γmax in the linear stage is consistent with the
growth of the peak value of the non-ideal electric ﬁeld
component EkB. In the non-linear stage, the growth of
γmax is close to linear, which would correspond to a con-
stant value of EkB. The ﬁnal values of the non-thermal
particle fractions appear to scale with the mean mag-
netization as fn,e ∝ σ3/4
hot . These scalings are expected
to saturate below unity for σhot ≫ 1, and the 3/4 index
may result from a transition between non-relativistic and
ultra-relativistic regimes. On the other hand, the maxi-
mum particle energy scales roughly like γmax ∝ σhot, as
has been found for suﬃciently large simulations of rela-
tivistic reconnection initiated from the Harris-type layers
(Werner et al. 2016). Figure 12 shows that the ﬁnal par-
ticle energy is determined both by the non-ideal electric
ﬁeld strength and by the time spent by the particle in
the acceleration region.

The emergence of the power-law component can be at-
tributed to the second-order Fermi process. This pro-
cess can be understood in the following way — (1) high-
energy particles emerging from the linear current lay-
ers are characterized by large gyroradii, and they follow
on chaotic orbits, independently of the small-scale mag-
netic structures; (2) oscillations of the merged magnetic
structures create multiple short-lived current layers with
diﬀerent orientations of the non-ideal electric ﬁeld; (3)
high-energy particles are more likely to pass across these
new acceleration regions, however they have comparable
chances to be accelerated or decelerated, depending on
the sign of Ekv. We do not ﬁnd any clear signatures of
the ﬁrst-order Fermi process in the non-linear accelera-
tion phase (cf. Hoshino 2012; Beresnyak & Li 2016).

The power-law indices for the highest mean cold mag-
netization probed σcold ∼ 30 are p ≃ 2.5, which is signif-
icantly higher than the values p ∼ 1.2 − 1.7 reported for
Harris-layer simulations with comparable upstream val-
ues of σcold (Sironi & Spitkovsky 2014; Guo et al. 2014;
Werner et al. 2016). This may actually be useful for as-
trophysical applications, where there are more cases for
high particle distribution indices p > 2; in this sense the

Harris-type reconnection in the ultra-relativistic limit ap-
pears to be too eﬃcient a particle accelerator. The lower
acceleration eﬃciency can be explained by the lower frac-
tion of magnetic free energy — fB ≃ 25% in our case
vs. fB ≃ 50% in the case of Harris-type layers. The
fraction of free magnetic energy in our 2D simulations is
only slightly lower than the theoretical prediction of 29%
corresponding to the isotropic Taylor state (see Section
2). In the case of periodic Harris-type setups, the ﬁnal
conﬁguration departures further from the Taylor state,
and hence an analytical prediction of fB is more diﬃ-
cult. Finally, we note that the free energy associated with
ABC magnetic ﬁelds can be increased indeﬁnitely by con-
sidering higher-order harmonics. However, in such case
the topological constraints limit the dissipation eﬃciency
in 2D, and hence investigating highly eﬃcient magnetic
dissipation requires large 3D simulations (Zrake & East
2016).

A certain disadvantage of the “ABC” magnetostatic
equilibria is that their mean magnetization σ is numeri-
cally limited by the spatial resolution L/ρ0, at least un-
der our conservative requirement that the kinetic scale
ρ0 should always be resolved. This limitation arises from
the uniform distribution of magnetic ﬁeld gradients that
have to be supported by volume-ﬁlling currents. Eﬀec-
tively, our study is conﬁned to one order of magnitude in
plasma magnetization. This is in contrast to the Harris-
type conﬁguration, where magnetic ﬁeld gradients are
conﬁned to narrow layers, and hence a wide range of up-
stream magnetizations, spanning almost three orders of
magnitude, can be studied at ﬁxed numerical resolution
(Guo et al. 2014; Werner et al. 2016).

Our simulations correspond eﬀectively to guide-ﬁeld
reconnection, and given the Beltrami condition we have
no way to vary the level of the guide ﬁeld. Even though
Bz vanishes initially along the separatrices, it is readily
advected, roughly incompressibly, into the current lay-
ers, so that |E| < |B| at all times everywhere in the
layer (see Figure 7). This is a potential concern if we
would like to apply these results to the gamma-ray ﬂares
in the Crab Nebula, as the prospect for breaking the syn-
chrotron photon energy limit in the Harris-layer recon-
nection scenario depends on the guide ﬁeld (Cerutti et al.
2013, 2014). However, what we need in order to break the
synchrotron limit is Ekv > B⊥v, and these components
depend on the exact trajectories of energetic particles.
Simulations of force-free magnetostatic equilibria taking
into account the synchrotron radiation reaction are re-
quired to address this problem, and will be presented in
a future study (Y. Yuan et al., in preparation).

5. CONCLUSIONS

We have investigated magnetic dissipation and parti-
cle acceleration in the simplest case of relativistic un-
stable 2D “ABC” magnetostatic equilibria by means of
fully kinetic PIC simulations with pair plasma. An ideal
instability leads to the formation of dynamical current
layers with complex internal structure, where a fraction
of particles is heated collectively by non-ideal electric
ﬁelds. Saturation of the instability leads to a slowly
decaying turbulence which diﬀuses the energetic parti-
cles in the energy space, eﬀectively forming power-law
energy distributions. The power-law slopes are signiﬁ-
cantly softer (p & 2.5) when compared with the case of

ultra-relativistic reconnection initiated from the Harris-
type layers (p . 1.5). This kind of magnetic dissipa-
tion corresponds to driven relativistic reconnection with
a substantial guide ﬁeld. However, since most of the dis-
sipation and particle acceleration proceed over a single
light-crossing time scale, this is an attractive scenario
for the production of rapid high-energy radiation ﬂares
observed in blazars, pulsar wind nebulae, GRBs, etc.
