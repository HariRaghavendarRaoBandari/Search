On this work, we consider a particle moving in front of a dielectric plate, and study two of the most
relevant eﬀects of the vacuum ﬁeld ﬂuctuations: the dissipation, and the decoherence of the particle’s
internal degrees of freedom. We consider the particle to follow a classical, macroscopically-ﬁxed
trajectory. To study the dissipative eﬀects, we calculate the in-out eﬀective action by functionally
integrating over the vacuum ﬁeld and the microscopic degrees of freedom of both the plate and the
particle. This in-out eﬀective action develops an imaginary part, hence a non-vanishing probability
for the decay (because of friction) of the initial vacuum state. We analyze how the dissipation
is aﬀected by the relative velocity between the particle and the plate and the properties of the
microscopic degrees of freedom.
In order to study the eﬀects of decoherence over the internal
degrees of freedom of the particle, we calculate the CTP or Schwinger-Keldysh inﬂuence action, by
functionally integrating over the vacuum ﬁeld and the microscopic degrees of freedom of the plate.
We estimate the decoherence time as the time needed by two diﬀerent quantum conﬁgurations (of
the internal degree of freedom of the particle) to be possible to diﬀerentiate from one another. We
analyze the way in which the presence of the mirror aﬀects the decoherence, and the possible ways
to maximize or reduce its eﬀects.

INTRODUCTION

2

Over the past few years, an increasing attention has been paid to the interaction between a particle and a (perfect
or imperfect) mirror or any dielectric surface [1–7]. One of the main interests has been to calculate the frictional
force exerted over the particle by the plate, mediated by the vacuum ﬁeld ﬂuctuations. As in the case of the
quantum friction between two plates [8–10], there is still no general agreement about the nature of this frictional
force. These frictional eﬀects are interesting, macroscopically observable consequences of the quantum nature of
microscopic systems. However, frictional and normal (Casimir) forces are not the only eﬀects of the vacuum quantum
ﬂuctuations. Any quantum system that interacts with an environment will suﬀer the process of decoherence, which
is one of the main ingredients necessary to understand the quantum-classical transition. The vacuum ﬁeld is, clearly,
an environment that cannot be switched oﬀ, since any particle (charged or with non-vanishing dipole moment) will
unavoidably interact with the electromagnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations. The eﬀects of the electromagnetic ﬁeld over the
coherence of the quantum state of a particle, and the way in which this eﬀect is modiﬁed by the presence of a
conducting plate, has already been studied for interference experiments [11, 12]. However, in the many studies of the
quantum friction over a moving particle in front of a dielectric plate, the eﬀects of decoherence have not yet been
taken into consideration. In this work, we will study the decoherence of the internal degree of freedom of the particle.
The loss of coherence of the particle’s dipolar moment becomes relevant in any Ramsey interferometry experiment,
where the depolarization of the atom could be macroscopically observed by means of the Ramsey fringes. In the case
of a Rydberg atom, this phenomenon could be also observed as a decay of the Raby oscillations [13, 14].

On this work we consider a neutral particle moving in front of an imperfect mirror. The trajectory of the particle
will be, along this paper, kept as an externally-ﬁxed variable. This accounts for many of the cases of interest, for
example, when the particle is the tip of a Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). When we specify the system, we will have
the particle moving at a constant velocity v, as is the most popular scenario in the literature [1, 2]. We are interested
in the dynamics of the internal degree of freedom of the particle, that we will model as a quantum harmonic oscillator,
being a simple model for the particle’s electric dipole, and that will be coupled in position to the vacuum ﬁeld. We
will also use a simple model for the microscopic degrees of freedom of the mirror, as we have done in a previous work
[15]: a set of uncoupled harmonic oscillators, each of them also interacting locally with the vacuum ﬁeld. Even though
this is a simple model, it allows us to calculate some relevant quantities without much further assumptions.

We will study both the eﬀects of friction and of decoherence over the moving particle, from the perspective of
quantum ﬁeld theory. In order to do so, we will use two diﬀerent but similar approaches. To study the friction, we
will follow the procedure presented in our previous work [15], where we studied the friction generated by the relative
motion of two dielectric plates. We will calculate the imaginary part of the in-out eﬀective action, that will account
for the dissipative eﬀects. To study the decoherence, we will switch to the Closed Time Path (CTP) formalism and
calculate the action of inﬂuence of the environment (vacuum ﬁeld + plate) over the particle, and use it to obtain an
estimation of the decoherence time, following an approach similar to the one in a previous work by some of us [16].

The structure of this paper is as follows: in Section II we deﬁne the system we study, and present the formalism
in Minkowski space. We then calculate the in-out eﬀective action for a speciﬁc microscopic model, and obtain an
expression for the imaginary part of the eﬀective action (and hence the dissipative eﬀects over the system) as a function
of the relative velocity. In Section III we review the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and obtain a general expression
for the CTP inﬂuence action for the internal degree of freedom of the particle, and use it to obtain the stochastic
equations of motion for the particle’s internal degree of freedom. In Section IV, we present a way to estimate of the
decoherence time, and then analyze the way in which it is modiﬁed by the presence of the plate. Finally, in Sec. V
we show our conclusions.

IN-OUT EFFECTIVE ACTION AND FRICTION

A. The system

Let us consider a speciﬁc system, even though the formalism that is going to be developed among the next sections
is general and could be used to study diﬀerent problems. In the current work, we are interested in the dissipative
eﬀects over a particle that moves parallel to a ﬂat, dielectric surface. The vacuum ﬁeld shall be a non-massive scalar
ﬁeld φ(x) obeying the Klein-Gordon equation, interacting with both the particle and the internal degrees of freedom
of the plate ψ(x). The particle moves in a macroscopic, externally-ﬁxed, uni-dimensional trajectory, in a plane parallel
to the plate. The distance a between the particle and the plate is also kept constant by an external source. We shall
call x1 the direction of movement of the particle, and x3 the direction perpendicular to the plate. The particle also
has an internal degree of freedom that we shall call q. A scheme of the system under consideration is shown in Fig.

1. We may write the classical action for the system as

where the Klein-Gordon action for the vacuum ﬁeld, neglecting boundary terms, is given by

The generating functional for the system will be given by

FIG. 1.
(Color online). A simple scheme of the system under consideration, where φ(x) is the vacuum ﬁeld, ψ(x) are the
internal degrees of freedom of the plate, and q(t) are the internal degrees of freedom of the particle, which follows a macroscopic
trajectory z(t) in the x1 direction.

The internal degrees of freedom of the plates can be integrated-out, resulting in an eﬀective interaction potential
V (x, x(cid:48)) for the vacuum ﬁeld. This procedure has already been performed in [17], and the resulting classical action is

S[φ, q] = Seﬀ[φ] + Spart

with

Seﬀ[φ] = S0[φ] +

(cid:90)

The internal degree of freedom of the particle interacts with the vacuum ﬁeld trough a current that we shall call
j(x). This current contains the information about the position and trajectory of the particle, and the strength of the
coupling. The interaction term is, then,

Spart
int [φ, q] = i

dxφ(x)j(x) .

(6)

It is worth noticing that, at this point, the current j(x) could make the vacuum ﬁeld interact with any system of any
given geometry: we have not yet speciﬁed that we are studying a moving, punctual particle.

B. The in-out eﬀective action

We would now like to obtain the eﬀective action for the particle. That is, we are going to functionally integrate

over the vacuum ﬁeld, to obtain the generating functional

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

Z[q] =

DφeiS[φ,q] = eiS0[q]

DφeiSeff[φ]+iSint[φ,q] .

This functional integral can be written as

,

where

A(x, x(cid:48)) = i [∂µ∂µ − i] δ(x − x(cid:48)) − iV (x − x(cid:48)) .

We need to obtain an operator A−1 such that

A−1(x, x(cid:48))A(x, x(cid:48)) = A(x, x(cid:48)) = A−1(x, x(cid:48)) = δ(x − x(cid:48)) .

In order to do so, we may write A(x, x(cid:48)) = iA0(x, x(cid:48)) + A1(x, x(cid:48)), where
A0(x, x(cid:48)) = δ(x − x(cid:48))(∂µ∂µ − i)
A1(x, x(cid:48)) = −iV (x, x(cid:48)).

(9)

(10)

Now, the eﬀective potential V (x, x(cid:48)) is proportional to the coupling constant λ between the vacuum ﬁeld and the
internal degrees of freedom of the plates. If this coupling is weak, then we can assume A1 << A0 and obtain A−1 as
an expansion in powers of λ. Keeping up to ﬁrst order in λ, we write

A−1(x, x) ≈ −i(I + iA−1

0 A1)A−1

And it is easy to prove that the operator from Eq. (11) satisﬁes

A−1A = AA−1 = I + O(λ2) .

The desired operator can be written as

(cid:19)

The only part of Eq. (8) remaining to be calculated is the normalization factor (det A)1/2. However, this factor
does not contribute to the connected diagrams: it involves only the interaction between the plate and the vacuum,
and has no eﬀect on the physics of the moving particle (or any other system we might be interested in, that could be
introduced through the current j(x)). That being said, we might write the generating functional for the particle

(cid:26)

The eﬀective action for the particle can be written as

Γ[q] = S0[q] + S1[q] + S2[q] ,

where S1 is the action that contains the inﬂuence of the vacuum over the particle, as if there was no dielectric plate,
and is deﬁned by

dxdx(cid:48)j(x)GF (x, x(cid:48))j(x(cid:48)) .

The term S2 accounts for the inﬂuence of the plate over the particle, mediated by the vacuum ﬁeld, and is deﬁned by

dxdydy(cid:48)dx(cid:48)j(x)GF (x, y)V (y, y(cid:48))GF (y(cid:48), x(cid:48))j(x(cid:48)).

(18)

We might think of the eﬀect of the plate on the particle as if mediated by a new eﬀective propagator ˜G(x, x(cid:48)):

dydy(cid:48)GF (x, y)V (y, y(cid:48))GF (y(cid:48), x(cid:48)) ,

(19)

and then S2 can be written as

(cid:90)

S2[q] = − 1
2

dxdx(cid:48)j(x) ˜G(x, x(cid:48))j(x(cid:48)).

(20)

But we are also interested in calculating the imaginary part of the in-out eﬀective action for the whole system,
since this quantity accounts for the dissipative eﬀects over the system. The following calculations will be completely
analogous to the ones we have performed in [15] for the case of two plates in relative parallel motion.

To obtain the in-out eﬀective action for the whole system, we need to integrate out the internal degree of freedom

of the particle q, that is, we need to functionally integrate Eq. (15) over q:

(cid:90)

Zsys =

DqZ[q].

(21)

But, instead of performing the functional integrations in this order (ﬁrst over ψ, then over φ, and last over q) we
go back a few steps and integrate over q before we integrate over the vacuum ﬁeld φ. The reason for doing this is
purely of mathematical simplicity, and it does not aﬀect the ﬁnal expression for the eﬀective action. We then obtain
an expression with two eﬀective potentials, one accounting for the interaction of the plate with the vacuum ﬁeld, and
another accounting for the interaction of the particle with the vacuum ﬁeld. If we only take into consideration the
terms involving both the plate and the particle, then the eﬀective action for small values of the coupling constants is
[15]:

C. Speciﬁc model and results

Now we would like to specify a concrete system of study. As we have already said in Sec. II A, even though, for the
sake of clarity, through this work we have talked about a particle and a plate, this situation has not yet been speciﬁed.
We have, so far, a complex, massless scalar ﬁeld φ that interacts with another ﬁeld ψ, that we call the internal degrees
of freedom of a plate, but could be associated to any other system that we might be interested in. When we integrate
those degrees of freedom out, we obtain a non-local eﬀective potential V (x, x(cid:48)) that contains the information about
the characteristics of the other system. It could be a thin plate, a half-space, or any other geometry, with any kind
of internal degrees of freedom. But if we do consider a thin, inﬁnitesimal plate, occupying the x3 = 0 plate, with
internal degrees of freedom that interact locally in space with the vacuum ﬁeld, then the eﬀective potential will have
the form: [17]

Vplate(q, p) =(2π)3λ(p0)δ(p0 − q0)δ(2)(p(cid:107)

− q(cid:107)) .

(23)

And if the particle is considered to be punctual, moving along the x1 axis with a constant velocity v, at a ﬁxed distance
x3 = a above of the plate, and interacting locally in position with the vacuum ﬁeld, then the eﬀective potential results:

Vparticle(q, p) = 2πg(p0 − vp1)δ(p0 − q0 − v(p1 − q1))e−ia(q3−p3) .

(24)

These potentials take into account the geometry of the plate and the particle, but the information about their
internal degrees of freedom and the nature of their interaction with the vacuum ﬁeld are yet to be speciﬁed by the
λ and g functions. The diﬀerence between a moving particle and a moving plate becomes clearer in position space,
where the potential is localized in position by means of three Diracs’ δ-functions, one indicating that the particle is
always on x3 = a (this δ-function was also present for the moving plate), other that the particle is always at x2 = 0,
and the third one indicating that it is always at x1 = vt.

By using the explicit shape of the potentials and integrating over q0, q1 and q2, we ﬁnd:

d4pd3G(p0, p1, p2, p3)λ(p0)G(p0, p1, p2, q3)g(p0 − vp1)e−i(q3−p3)a ,

(25)

(cid:90)

ΓI ≈ iT

2(2π)4

where T is total the time of ﬂight of the particle. We consider the internal degrees of freedom of the plate to be
uncoupled harmonic oscillators of frequency Ω, each of them interacting locally in position with the vacuum ﬁeld with
a coupling constant λ; and the internal degree of freedom of the particle will also be a harmonic oscillator of frequency

ω0, also interacting linearly and locally in position with the vacuum ﬁeld, with a coupling constant g. This results
[15] in

The remaining integrations are performed in the exact same way as the integrations in Ref.

[15]. The analytic

(27)

where ˜Ω = Ωa and ˜ω0 = ω0a are the dimensionless frequencies (a is the distance between the particle and the plate).
We show in Fig. 2 the imaginary part of the eﬀective action as a function of the relative velocity v.

FIG. 2. (Color online). Imaginary part of the in-out eﬀective action as a function of v, for ˜Ω = Ωa = 0.01 and λ = 0.01, in
units of g2.

As we mentioned before, the imaginary part of the eﬀective action implies the excitation of internal degrees of
freedom on the mirror that inﬂuence the particle through the vacuum ﬁeld. This signals a noncontact frictional eﬀect.
We can see that the dissipative eﬀects are strongly suppressed as v → 0. This exponential vanishing of the dissipation
eﬀects has already been found, using diﬀerent approaches, in previous works [1, 2].
It is worth noticing that our
coupling constant g is the analog to the electric dipole moment d appearing in the models used by other authors,
since it accounts for the interaction between the particle’s polarizability and the electromagnetic (vacuum) ﬁeld.
This means that the results presented here correspond to the d2 contribution to the friction, and we will calculate
the d4 contribution within this approach in a future work. Lastly, let us recall that the λ2 factor accounts for the
interaction between the internal degrees of freedom of the plate, and this information is usually contained in the
dielectric permitivity of the material, so there is no analog to our λ factor appearing in the literature.

It is possible to see, from the general expression of Eq. (27), that the case of resonance, for Ω = ω0, coincides
exactly with the expression of the imaginary part of the eﬀective action per unit of area, for the case of two plates of
frequency Ω, studied in Ref. [15]. This is not that surprising, since in our model the plate and the particle/other plate
only interact locally and the harmonic oscillators of the plate/s are uncoupled. In that work, we had set the coupling
constant between the two plates to be equal, and that is the reason why our result was of order λ4. It is important
to notice that it does not mean that our result is to be compared with the g4 results appearing in literature, since a
factor λ2 is to be considered part of the dielectric permitivity of the material.

III. CTP ACTION OF INFLUENCE AND DECOHERENCE

A. The Schwinger-Keldysh or Close Time Path formalism

Up to this Section, we have considered the eﬀective action for the system (the particle), and the inﬂuence action
that mainly describes the dynamics of the particle after integration of the quantum ﬁelds. This in-out eﬀective action

00.20.40.60.81·10−102040vImΓ/T˜ω0=0.014˜ω0=0.012˜ω0=0.010˜ω0=0.008˜ω0=0.0067

(cid:90)

cannot be applied in a straightforward way to the derivation of the equations of motion, since they would become
neither real nor causal. As is well known, in order to get the correct eﬀective equations of motion, one should compute
the in-in, Schwinger-Keldysh or Closed Time Path Eﬀective Action (CTPEA) [18], which also has information on the
stochastic dynamics. The CTPEA is deﬁned as:

Dφ+Dφ−eiS[q+,φ+]−iS[q−,φ−] ≡

DφeiSC[q,φ]

e−iΓCTP [q+, q−] =

dt(cid:82)
where in the last step we have introduced the the CTP complex temporal path C, going from minus to plus inﬁnity C+
−, with a decreasing (inﬁnitesimal) imaginary part. Time integration over the contour C is deﬁned
and backwards C
±. The equation above is
C−
useful because it has the structure of the usual in-out or the Euclidean eﬀective action, and we are able to use the
results of the last section, but properly changing the contour of integration. This would lead to the appearance of the
CTP propagators Gαβ(x, t; x’, t(cid:48)), where α (β) = ± indicates that t (t(cid:48)) is on C
±. For the free scalar ﬁeld, the CTP
propagators are:

G−−(x, x(cid:48)) =∆D(x, x(cid:48)) = i(cid:104) ˆT φ(x)φ(x(cid:48))(cid:105)
G+−(x, x(cid:48)) =∆−(x, x(cid:48)) = −i(cid:104)φ(x(cid:48))φ(x)(cid:105)
G−+(x, x(cid:48)) =∆+(x, x(cid:48)) = +i(cid:104)φ(x)φ(x(cid:48))(cid:105)

These CTP propagators satisfy the following properties, that will prove to be useful below: (G++)∗ = G−−,
(G+−)∗ = G−+, and G++ − G−− = G+−
We are now in a position to write the actions describing the inﬂuence of the environment on the particle within
this formalism. We will do this in a general way, and later we will come back to our speciﬁc model. By performing
the change in the contour of integration, S1 results (see eq. (17)):

− G−+.

dxdy(cid:2)j+(x)G++(x, y)j+(y) − j−(x)G−−(x, y)j−(y) − j+(x)G+−(x, y)j−(y)

where j±(x) is evaluated over C

(29)

,

.

∆j(x) =

Σj(x) =

j+(x) − j−(x)

2

j+(x) + j−(x)

2

By writing Eq. (29) in terms of ∆j and Σj, one obtains four diﬀerent terms. However, by recalling the deﬁnition
and properties of the diﬀerent CTP propagators, it is easy to see that one of the terms vanishes, and two of the
remaining terms are identical, with the result:

1 [q+, q−] = − 1
SIF
2

dxdy {∆j(x) [G++(x, y) − G−−(x, y) − G−+(x, y) + G+−(x, y)] ∆j(y)

+ 2∆j(x) [G++(x, y) + G−−(x, y) + G−+(x, y) + G+−(x, y)] Σj(y)} ,

With some further considerations concerning the properties of the propagators mentioned above, it is possible to
deﬁne the noise (diﬀusion) kernel

associated with ﬂuctuations, source of decoherence eﬀects; and the dissipation kernel

N1(x, y) ≡ −i(G++(x, y) − G−−(x, y)) = 2 Im G++(x, y) ,

D1(x, y) ≡ 1
2

[G++(x, y) + G−−(x, y) + G+−(x, y) + G−+(x, y)] = 2Θ(x0 − y0)Re G++(x − y) .

Both kernels are real, and the dissipation kernel is explicitly causal. The inﬂuence action results, then

1 [q+, q−] = −
SIF

dxdy [i∆j(x)N1(x, y)∆j(y) + 2∆j(x)D1(x, y)Σj(y)] .

This action accounts for the interaction of the particle with the vacuum, and all the propagators involved in the
calculations correspond to free, scalar ﬁelds. Furthermore, in order to take the dielectric plate into consideration, we
have to look at the S2 term from Eq. (20), which contains the eﬀect of the plate over the particle up to ﬁrst order in
the coupling constant λ. By changing the contour of integration, we obtain an expression analogous to Eq. (29), but
changing the free CTP propagator Gαβ for an eﬀective CTP propagator ˜Gαβ, deﬁned by:

On general grounds, the real and imaginary parts of the inﬂuence action can be associated with the dissipation and
noise, respectively, and can be related by some integral equation known as the ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation. As we
shall see, the dissipation will be present in the generalized Langevin-like equation of motion for the internal degrees of
freedom of the particle, and the noise kernel will be relevant in deﬁning the correlation function for the noise source.

B. Our model

We will now consider, as we have done in Sec.

II C, an inﬁnitesimally thin plate occupying the plane x3 = 0,
formed by a set of uncoupled harmonic oscillators of frequency Ω, each of them interacting locally in position with
the vacuum ﬁeld with a coupling constant λ. We have already found the CTP expression for the eﬀective potential
in a previous work: [15]

The same kind of reasoning applies to the current j(x). We now want it to describe a particle moving in the
direction x1, describing a trajectory z(t), at a ﬁxed distance a from the plate. That is, its macroscopic coordinates are
given by xµ(t) = (z(t), 0, a, t), and are kept ﬁxed by an external source. On the other hand, we describe its internal
degree of freedom as an uni-dimensional harmonic oscillator q(t) of frequency ω0. This is the variable whose dynamics
we now wish to study. So we have:

j(x) = gq(t)δ(x1 − z(t))δ(x2)δ(x3 − a) ,

(38)

where g is the coupling constant between the vacuum and the internal degree of freedom of the particle. Now, as the
classic trajectory z(t) is macroscopic and externally ﬁxed, we might assume that it remains the same in the diﬀerent
branches of the CTP integral. That is, we will from now on assume that z+(t) = z−(t), where z±(t) is the classical
function z(t) integrated over the contour C

±. This means that:

∆j(x) = g∆q(t)δ(x1 − z(t))δ(x2)δ(x3)
Σj(x) = gΣq(t)δ(x1 − z(t))δ(x2)δ(x3).

With these speciﬁc considerations, we can deﬁne, for N ≡ N1 + N2:

(cid:90)

N (t − t(cid:48)) ≡ g2

dxdx(cid:48)δ(x1 − z(t))δ(x2)δ(x3 − a)N (x − x(cid:48))δ(x(cid:48)1 − z(t(cid:48)))δ(x(cid:48)2)δ(x(cid:48)3) ,

and an analogous expression is obtained for D ≡ D1 + D2.

Within this model, we can write explicit expressions for D1, D2, N1 and N2 as integrals in momentum space. If

the trajectory is z(t) = vt for constant v, then:

D1(t − t(cid:48)) = 2g2Θ(t − t(cid:48))Re

Therefore, the inﬂuence action for the moving particle in front of a dielectric plate is given, formally, by

C. Real and causal equations of motion

From Secs.

III and III B, it is easy to see that the (CTP) inﬂuence action has a real part, generated by the
dissipation kernels D1 and D2, and an imaginary part, generated by the noise kernels N1 and N2. In order to obtain
the real and causal equations of motion for q(t), we must functionally derive S[q+, q−] = S0[q+]− S[
0q−] + SIF[q+, q−]
with respect to q+, and set q+ = q− = q. However, this procedure would lead us to the equations for the mean value
of q(t), and the stochastic eﬀect of the noise would not appear.

In order to see the inﬂuence of the noise on the equations of motion, it is necessary to consider a realization of the
noise over the system, considering an stochastic source of noise ξ(t). Following the well-known procedure for open
quantum systems, we consider this stochastic force to have a Gaussian probability distribution given by:

(cid:90)

(cid:26)

− 1
2

(cid:27)

P [ξ(t)] = Nξ exp

dtdt(cid:48)ξ(t)N−1(t, t(cid:48))ξ(t(cid:48))

.

(45)

It is easy to see that the inclusion of this stochastic source can be performed by adding to the generating functional
the factor

DξP [ξ]e−i(cid:82) dt∆q(t)ξ(t) = ei(cid:82) dtdt(cid:48)∆q(t)N (t,t(cid:48))∆q(t(cid:48)) ,

which, as it is shown in the RHS of the last equation, leaves the generating functional unaltered. The modiﬁed
inﬂuence action is, then

ˆSIF[q+, q−, ξ] = 2

dtdt(cid:48)∆q(t)D(t, t(cid:48))Σq(t(cid:48)) −

dt∆q(t)ξ(t) .

(cid:90)

(cid:16)

(cid:90)

And the equation of motion will be given by:

S0[q+] − S0[q−] + ˆSIF[q+, q−, ξ]

δ

δq+

= 0 .

(cid:90)
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)q+=q−=q

(cid:17)

The result is:

(cid:90)

¨q(t) + ω2

0q(t) +

dt(cid:48)D(t, t(cid:48))q(t(cid:48)) = ξ(t) ,

10

(49)

where it is easy to see that the dissipation on the system comes from the kernel D(t, t(cid:48)), and the ﬂuctuations are
generated by the stochastic force ξ(t), that must fulﬁll, according to Eq. (45):

(cid:104)ξ(t)(cid:105) = 0

(cid:104)ξ(t)ξ(t(cid:48))(cid:105) = N (t, t(cid:48))

This is a generalized Langevin equation, with classical noise ξ and dissipation, that satisﬁes the ﬂuctuation-
dissipation theorem. Each part of the environment that we include leads to a further dissipative term on the left-hand
side of Eq.(49) (i.e. D1 and D2 as we named before) with a countervailing noise term on the right-hand side. Of
course it is very diﬃcult to solve this stochastic equation analytically. It is diﬃcult to imagine an ab initio derivation
of the dissipative and noise terms from the full quantum theory. In this sense, a reasonable alternative is to ana-
lyze phenomenological stochastic equations numerically and check the robustness of the predictions against diﬀerent
choices of the dissipative kernels and of the type of noise.

IV. DECOHERENCE OF THE PARTICLE’S INTERNAL DEGREES OF FREEDOM

The absence of quantum interference between the stationary phase solutions to the classical stochastic equations,
q(t), is manifested through the increasing decay of the non-diagonal terms of the reduced density matriz ρ[q+, q−, t].
This leads to the crucial notion of a decoherence time tD, after which ρ (or, more exactly, its real part) is eﬀectively
diagonal. Eq. (49) is the classical stochastic equation that we are looking for but, as it stands, is only guaranteed to
describe classical degrees of freedom qclass(t) after decoherence (see in another context Refs. [19, 20]).

The notion of consistent histories provides an alternative approach to classicality, opposed to trying to solve the
master equation, and it is normally used in open quantum systems. Quantum evolution can be considered as a
coherent superposition of ﬁne-grained histories. Since we need to be able to distinguish diﬀerent classical system
conﬁgurations evolving in time, we work in the basis of amplitudes q(t). If one deﬁnes the c-number q(t) as specifying
a ﬁne-grained history, the quantum amplitude for that history is Ψ ∼ eS[q] (we work in units in which  = 1) [21]. In
the quantum open system approach that we have adopted here, we are concerned with coarse-grained histories

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

Ψ[α] =

DqeS[q]α[q],

(50)

where α[q] is the ﬁlter function that deﬁnes the coarse-graining. In the ﬁrst instance this ﬁltering corresponds to
tracing over all the degrees of freedom of the composite environment. From this we deﬁne the decoherence functional
for two coarse-grained histories as

D[α+, α−] =

Dq+Dq−ei(S[q+]−S[q−])α+[q+]α−[q−].

(51)

D[α+, α?] does not factorize because the histories q± are not independent. Decoherence means physically that the
diﬀerent coarse-graining histories making up the full quantum evolution acquire individual reality, and may therefore
be assigned deﬁnite probabilities in the classical sense. A necessary and suﬃcient condition for the validity of the
sum rules of probability theory (i.e. no quantum interference terms) is [22]

ReD[α+, α−] ≈ 0,

(52)
when α+ (cid:54)= α−, (although in most cases the stronger condition D[α+, α−] ≈ 0 holds) [23]. Such histories are consistent
[24].

For our particular application, we wish to consider as a single coarse-grained history all those ﬁne-grained ones
where the solution q(t) remains close to a prescribed classical conﬁguration qcl. The ﬁlter function takes the form

αcl[q] =(cid:82) DJei(cid:82) J(q−qcl αcl[J].Using that Jq =(cid:82) dxJ(x)q[x], we may write the decoherence functional between two

classical histories in terms of the closed-path-time generating functional. In principle, we can examine adjacent general

classical solutions for their consistency but, in practice, it is simpler to restrict ourselves to particular solutions q±,
according to the nature of the decoherence that we are studying. All in all, the decoherence functional results in

11

D[q+

cl , q−cl ] ≈ F [q+

cl , q−cl ],

(53)

where F [q+
the inﬂuence action SIF[q+, q−] as F = exp[−iSIF]. As a result,

cl , q−cl ] is the Feynman-Vernon inﬂuence functional (IF) [25]. The inﬂuence functional is written in terms of

|D[q+

cl , q−cl ]| ∼ exp{iImSIF[q+

cl , q−cl ]},

(54)

where SIF is the contribution to the action due to the, in our case, composite environment. From this viewpoint,
once we have chosen the classical solutions of interest, adjacent histories become consistent at the time tD, for which
1 ≈ ImSIF|t=tD [21]. This decoherence time will become relevant in any Ramsey interferometry experiment [13]. For
times larger than tD, the Ramsey fringes will no longer be distinguishable, expressing the depolarization of the atom.

A.

Imaginary part of SIF

Let us recall the expression for N1(t, t(cid:48)) given by Eq. (30), and consider two classical trajectories qcl(t) with diﬀerent

amplitudes but the same frequency.

∆qcl(t) = ∆q0 cos(ω0t).

(55)

So we can write an expression for the imaginary part of the inﬂuence action for the particle in presence of the

vacuum ﬁeld (ignoring the plate), as:

(cid:27)

All the temporal integrations result in Dirac delta functions. The last two terms vanish because the resulting deltas
cannot be fulﬁlled simultaneously. From each non-vanishing term, an inﬁnite δ(0) is obtaining, accounting for the
total time of integration T (time of ﬂight of the particle). Thus the integrals over p0 can trivially be performed, and
the remaining terms are:

Here P (k) = (k − ω0)2v2 − k2 and A(k) = (k − ω0)2 − Ω2. We will begin by considering the ﬁrst term. If P (k) had
a deﬁnite sign, we could get rid of the i accompanying it. Since P (k) has two real roots, located at k+ = vω0

Now, within each region, P (k) has a deﬁnite sign, and the limit  → 0 can be taken on the terms involoving P (k).
On the other hand, the integrand will have two poles associated with the zeros of A(k), which are located at
k1 = ω0 + Ω and k2 = ω0 − Ω. It is easy to see that k1 is always located in region (III), and that k2 could be on any
region, depending on the values of the external parameters of the problem: v, ω0 and Ω. With a little algebra, we
ﬁnd that k2 is on region (II) if and only if:

This condition is important in order to explicitly calculate the integrals.

Let us start computing the integral over region (II). In order to do so, we will have in mind that, when  → 0:

and, when we take  → 0, the only contributions to the imaginary part will come from the −iπδ term. The only
remaining question is how many zeros does A(k) have on the integration region. As we already said, k1 is always on
region (III), so we will always have a contribution coming from k1, that is:

And, when the condition (68) is not fulﬁlled, then k2 is also on region (I) or on region (III), so we will have an extra
contribution of the form:

So far, we have computed the result of the ﬁrst term on Eq. (66). The procedure for computing the second term is
completely analogous, so we are now in a position to write the result for the imaginary part of the action of inﬂuence.

C. Estimation of the decoherence time

We are now in a position to estimate the decoherence time for the particle. The total imaginary part of the action

of inﬂuence (up to second order in λ) is:

Now, as we have detailed on the beginning of this Section, the decoherence time can be estimated by the time of

ﬂight of the particle when ImSIF ∼ 1, so that:

where S1 and S2 are deﬁned in Eq. (76) and (77) respectively. After numerically performing these integrals, we are
in a position to plot, in Fig. 3 (a), the estimation of the decoherence time as a function of the velocity of the particle,
for diﬀerent values of the coupling constant between the plate and the vacuum, λ. There is a global factor A = 2

that shows that the decoherence time is reduced for larger values of the coupling constant between the particle and
the vacuum ﬁeld, and for larger diﬀerence in the amplitudes of the classical trajectories under consideration.

Now, as can be seen in Fig. 3 (a), the presence of the plate reduces the decoherence time, but only for non-
vanishing relative velocity. For a particle that is at rest or moving at very small velocities with respect to the plate,
the decoherence time is not reduced, even for greater values of the coupling constant between the plate and the
vacuum ﬁeld (and hence stronger interaction between the particle and the plate, mediated by the vacuum ﬁeld). Now,
for non-vanishing velocities, the decoherence of the particle is greater the stronger the coupling between the plate and
the vacuum ﬁeld.

In Fig. 3 (b), tD is shown as a function of the plate’s characteristic dimensionless frequency ˜Ω, for diﬀerent values
of its macroscopic velocity v.
In the graphic, a clear minimum appears for every value of v, and it is located in
˜Ω = 0.03 = ˜ω0. This means that the decoherence is maximal in the resonant case, hence making the decoherece time
vanish. Far from the resonance, that is, for values of Ω >> ω0 (or the opposite limit when possible), the decoherence
time tends to the limiting value that corresponds to the case λ = 0 (the case with no plate).

From the results shown above, we can see that, in this simple model, the presence of the plate enhances the
decoherence over the particle. The decoherence eﬀects can be maximized by an appropiate choice of the atom’s

ﬁne-grained history (∆q0 the classical amplitud diﬀerence in our example) and the plate’s material (for a relation
between the λ(ω) function of the material and its dielectric permitivity (ω), see Ref. [26]). As it has already been
discussed [11], the decoherence eﬀects given solely by the vacuum ﬁeld are neglectable. The coupling between any
neutral atom and the vacuum ﬁeld is very weak, resulting in an almost inﬁnite decoherence time. However, from our
results it can be seen that, by carefully choosing the plate’s material (i.e., close to the resonance in Fig. 3 (b) ), the
decoherence time could be drastically reduced. We also show that the relative velocity contributes to the enhancing
of the decoherence eﬀects.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have used a functional approach to study the eﬀects of quantum vacuum ﬂuctuations on a particle
moving parallel to an imperfect mirror. We have presented a simple model in which the vacuum ﬁeld is a massless,
real, scalar ﬁeld coupled to the microscopic degrees of freedom of the mirror and the internal degree of freedom of the
particle. In our simple model, the plate is formed by uncoupled unidimensional harmonic oscillators, each of them
interacting locally in position with the vacuum ﬁeld. The macroscopic trajectory of the particle was externally ﬁxed,
and its internal degree of freedom was also an unidimensional harmonic oscillator, also coupled in position with the
scalar ﬁeld, resulting in a dipole-like interaction.

We ﬁrst studied the dissipative eﬀects over the system. In order to do that, we followed the same approach we
had used in our previous work [15]: we calculate the in-out eﬀective action for the whole system, which presented an
imaginary part that accounted for the non-vanishing probability of decay of the system’s initial state due to friction.
We found that these dissipative eﬀects depended on the relative velocity between the particle and the mirror, and on
the characteristic of the materials. We also found that, within our simple model, the imaginary part of the eﬀective
action for a particle moving in front of a mirror is the same as the imaginary part of the eﬀective action per unit of
area for two mirrors in parallel relative motion [15].

Then, we switched to the Schiwinger-Keldysh or CTP formalism in order to study the decoherence suﬀered by the
particle due to its interaction with the vacuum ﬁeld ﬂuctuations, and its eﬀective (mediated by the vacuum ﬁeld)
interaction with the mirror. We calculated the CTP eﬀective action describing the inﬂuence of the vacuum ﬁeld and
the microscopic degrees of freedom of the mirror over the internal degree of freedom of the particle. This action of
inﬂuence allowed us to estimate the decoherence time, in which two diﬀerent quantum states for the particle could
no longer be distinguished from one another. We found the decoherence time to decrease with the presence of the
mirror, and to be minimized when the characteristic frequencies of the mirror and the particle are the same (resonant
case). We also found that the relative velocity between the mirror and the plate increases the decoherence, as does the
increasing of any of the coupling constants. We expect that in a Ramsey-like interference experiment, the parameters
of our model could be chosen in a way that would maximize the decoherence eﬀects. As we have modeled the atom
as the lowest energy levels of a harmonic oscillator, it is possible to choose its characteristic frequency close to the
resonance with the plate. In addition, with a non-vanishing relative velocity, we expect decoherence eﬀects to be
observed by means of the attenuation of the contrast in the Ramsey fringes.
