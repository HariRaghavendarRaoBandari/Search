Adiabatic elimination for open quantum systems with

eﬀective Lindblad master equations ∗

Introduction

We consider an open quantum system described by a
Lindblad-type master equation with two times-scales.
The fast time-scale is strongly dissipative and drives the
system towards a low-dimensional decoherence-free
space. To perform the adiabatic elimination of this fast
relaxation, we propose a geometric asymptotic expan-
sion based on the small positive parameter describing
the time-scale separation. This expansion exploits geo-
metric singular perturbation theory and center-manifold
techniques. We conjecture that, at any order, it pro-
vides an eﬀective slow Lindblad master equation and
a completely positive parameterization of the slow in-
variant sub-manifold associated to the low-dimensional
decoherence-free space. By preserving complete posi-
tivity and trace, two important structural properties at-
tached to open quantum dynamics, we obtain a reduced-
order model that directly conveys a physical interpre-
tation since it relies on eﬀective Lindbladian descrip-
tions of the slow evolution. At the ﬁrst order, we derive
simple formulae for the eﬀective Lindblad master equa-
tion. For a speciﬁc type of fast dissipation, we show
how any Hamiltonian perturbation yields Lindbladian
second-order corrections to the ﬁrst-order slow evolu-
tion governed by the Zeno-Hamiltonian. These results
are illustrated on a composite system made of a strongly
dissipative harmonic oscillator, the ancilla, weakly cou-
pled to another quantum system.

Solving the equation of evolution for a open quantum
system - the Lindblad master equation [3] - is generally
tedious. To gain better physical insight and/or for nu-
merical simulations, it is of wide interest to compute
rigorous reduced models of quantum dynamical sys-
tems. In a typical case, a system of interest is coupled
to an ancillary system expressing a measurement device
or a perturbing environment [10]. The quantum dynam-
ics describes the joint evolution of both systems and in
order to focus only on the system of interest we want to
determine a dynamical equation for the system of inter-
est only, from which we have “eliminated” the ancillary
system.

A standard tool for model reduction is to use the dif-
ferent timescales of the complete system to separate
the quantum dynamics into fast and slow variables and
then eliminate the fast ones. This technique is known
as adiabatic elimination. In quantum Hamiltonian sys-
tems, regular perturbation theory can be easily applied
as the propagator remains unitary, and the construction
of the reduced model to various orders of approxima-
tion is standard [17].
In contrast, for open quantum
systems, described by a Lindblad master equation [3],
the case is much more complicated and involves sin-
gular perturbation theory. Several particular examples
have been treated separately. In [4] diﬀerent methods
are proposed to perform an adiabatic elimination up to
second-order on a lambda system. In [14] and [16] the
problem of excited states decaying towards n grounds
state is treated. A speciﬁc atom-optics dynamics is in-
vestigated in [1]. In the presence of continuous mea-
surement, [7] presents a method of adiabatic elimina-
tion for systems with Gaussian dynamics.

However, no general and systematic method has been
developed yet for adiabatic elimination in systems with
Lindblad dynamics. More precisely, treating the Lind-

blad master equation as a usual linear system, or apply-
ing the Schrieﬀer-Wolﬀ formalism which is generalized
in [11] to Lindblad dynamics, requires the inversion of
super-operators which can be troublesome both numer-
ically and towards physical interpretation.
In [2] we
made a ﬁrst attempt to circumvent this inversion, using
invariants of the dynamics. This provides a ﬁrst-order
expansion only, and in general linear form — i.e. not
necessarily with the structure of a Lindblad equation.

In the present paper, we propose a geometric method
to perform an adiabatic elimination for open quan-
tum systems, whose key feature is that the resulting
reduced model is explicitly described by an eﬀective
Lindblad equation. The reduced system is parameter-
ized by a reduced density operator and the mapping
from the reduced model to the initial system state space
is expressed in terms of Kraus operators, ensuring a
trace-preserving completely positive map. By preserv-
ing these structural properties of open quantum dynam-
ics, we obtain a reduced model that directly conveys
a physical interpretation. As far as we know, combin-
ing asymptotic expansion with completely positive map
and Lindbladian formulation has never been addressed
before. This work is a ﬁrst attempt to investigate the
interest of such combination with lemmas 1, 2 and 3
underlying the conjecture illustrated on ﬁgure 1.

Our method applies to general open quantum systems
with two timescales, described by two general Lindbla-
dian super-operators (1), and where the fast Lindbladian
makes the system converge to a decoherence-free sub-
space of the overall Hilbert space. We then use a ge-
ometric approach based on center manifold techniques
[6] and geometric singular perturbation theory [9] to ob-
tain an expansion of the eﬀect of the perturbation intro-
duced by the slow Lindbladian on this decoherence-free
subspace. For general Lindbladians satisfying this set-
ting, we get explicit formulas for the Lindblad operators
describing the ﬁrst-order expansion.
In the particular
case of a Hamiltonian perturbation, we retrieve the well
known Zeno eﬀect. Furthermore, for a fast Lindbladian
described by a single decoherence operator and subject
to a Hamiltonian perturbation, we derive explicit formu-
las for the ﬁrst-order eﬀect on the location of the cen-
ter manifold and for Lindblad operators describing the
second-order expansion of the dynamics. This allows
to highlight how a ﬁrst-order Zeno eﬀect is associated
to second-order decoherence.

We apply our method to a quantum system coupled
to a highly dissipative quantum harmonic oscillator (an-
cilla). Our general formulas directly provide an ef-

fective Lindblad master equation of the reduced model
where this ancilla is eliminated. The result for this ex-
ample is well known [5], which allows us to emphasize
how the correct results are obtained also on inﬁnite-
dimensional systems, and to appreciate the computa-
tional simplicity of our method in comparison with pre-
vious ones.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents
the structure of two-timescales master equation for open
quantum systems, as well as the assumptions and prop-
erties of the unperturbed system used for deriving our
results. In section 3 we present a geometric approach
for performing the adiabatic elimination and derive a
ﬁrst-order reduced model for arbitrary perturbations. In
section 4 we develop the second-order expansion for a
class of systems. In section 5 we illustrate the method
where the ancilla is a highly dissipative harmonic oscil-
lator.

Denote by H a Hilbert space of ﬁnite dimension, by D
the compact convex set of density operators ρ on H (ρ
is Hermitian, nonnegative and trace one). We consider
a two-time scale dynamics on D described by the fol-
lowing master diﬀerential equation

where  is a small positive parameter and the linear
super-operators L0 and L1 are of Lindbladian forms [3].
That is, there exist two ﬁnite families of operators on
H, denoted by (L0,ν) and (L1,ν), and two Hermitian op-
erators H0 and H1 (called Hamiltonians) such that, for
r = 0, 1, we have
Lr(ρ) = −i[Hr, ρ]+

It is well known that if the initial condition ρ(0) belongs
to D, then the solution ρ(t) of (1) remains in D and is
deﬁned for all t ≥ 0. It is also a known fact that the
ﬂow of (1) is a contraction for many distances, such as
the one derived from the nuclear norm (cid:107) · (cid:107)1: for any
trajectories ρ1 and ρ2 of (1), we have (cid:107)ρ1(t) − ρ2(t)(cid:107)1 ≤
(cid:107)ρ1(t(cid:48)) − ρ2(t(cid:48))(cid:107)1 for all t ≥ t(cid:48); see e.g. [15, Th.9.2].

a completely positive linear map [15, Chap.8], R is also
a completely positive map. By Choi’s theorem [8] there

We assume additionally that D0 coincides with the
set of density operators with support in H0, a subspace
of H. In other words the unperturbed master equation
features a decoherence-free space H0. Denote by P0 the
operator on H corresponding to orthogonal projection
onto H0. Consequently, for any Hermitian operator ρ,

R∗(P0) = I.

Moreover, for any vector |c(cid:105) in H0, R(|c(cid:105)(cid:104)c|) = |c(cid:105)(cid:104)c|.
This implies that, for the Kraus map (3), there exists a

We consider here the perturbed master equation (1)
whose unperturbed part d
dt ρ = L0(ρ) satisﬁes the as-
sumptions of Section 2: any trajectory converges to a
steady-state; the set of steady-states D0 coincides with
the set of density operators with support on a subspace
H0 of H. This section develops a ﬁrst-order expansion
versus  of (1) around D0.
Denote by Hs (subscript s for slow), an abstract
Hilbert space with the same dimension as H0. Denote
by Ds the set of density operators on Hs. Denote by
{|ν(cid:105)} (resp. {|cν(cid:105)}) a Hilbert basis of Hs (resp. H0). Con-
sider the Kraus map K0 deﬁned by

Illustrative example: low-Q cav-
ity coupled to another quantum
system

The developments above are rigorous in ﬁnite dimen-
sion, but they can be formally applied also on inﬁnite-
dimensional systems, as illsutrated in the following ex-
ample.

We consider a strongly dissipative driven harmonic
oscillator (low-Q cavity) coupled to another, undamped
quantum system with the same transition frequency
(“target” system). Denote HA (resp. HB) the inﬁnite-
dimensional Hilbert space of the strongly dissipative

harmonic oscillator (resp. the target system), spanned
by the Fock states {|nA(cid:105)}n∈N (resp. a possibly inﬁnite ba-
sis {|nB(cid:105)}nB); ρ is the density operator of the composite
system, on H = HA ⊗ HB.

In the frame rotating at the common frequency of the
two systems, their coupled evolution is described by the
standard master diﬀerential equation:

(18)
Here ˜a = a ⊗ IB and ˜b = IA ⊗ b are the annihilation
operators respectively for the harmonic oscillator A and
for the quantum system B (possibly generalized if B is
not a harmonic oscillator; e.g. if B is a qubit, we have
b = |g(cid:105)(cid:104)e| the transition operator from excited to ground
state). The ﬁrst line describes the driven and damped
evolution of harmonic oscillator A, while the second
line describes the exchange of energy quanta between
the two quantum systems. The constants (κ, g) ∈ R2
govern the speed of these dynamics. We here consider
κ (cid:29) g, with the goal to adiabatically eliminate the fast
dynamics of the low-Q cavity and compute its eﬀect on
the other quantum system. The dynamics (18) is then
equivalent to

. For this typical example, the results
of Ls,1 and Ls,2 are well known (see e.g. [5, chap.12]).
Our results allow to readily retrieve their expression and
thus completely circumvent the trouble of the usual cal-
culation.

, ρ

In the absence of coupling between the two subsys-
tems ( = 0), the overall system trivially converges to-
wards R(ρ0) = |α(cid:105)(cid:104)α|A ⊗ TrA(ρ(0)). Here TrA is the par-
tial trace over HA and |α(cid:105) denotes the coherent state of
amplitude α ∈ C, towards which a classically driven
and damped harmonic oscillator is known to converge.
Therefore we have H0 = |α(cid:105)(cid:104)α| ⊗ HB, P0 = |α(cid:105)(cid:104)α| ⊗ IB,
and Mµ = |α(cid:105)(cid:104)µA| ⊗ IB with µ spanning N. We will nat-
urally describe ρS on the Hilbert space Hs ≡ HB and

with basis {|ns(cid:105)}ns, so S 0 =(cid:80)

n |α(cid:105)|nB(cid:105)(cid:104)ns|.

For the ﬁrst-order perturbation, using the property

˜a|α(cid:105) = α|α(cid:105), Lemma 1 readily yields

Hs,1 = αb†

From Lemma 2, we see that a pure state |ψS(cid:105) ∈ Hs gets
mapped at order zero to |α(cid:105) ⊗ |ψB(cid:105) with |ψB(cid:105) ≡ |ψS(cid:105),

Thus the second-order correction vanishes and the Zeno

6 Conclusion

We have shown how to eliminate the fast dynamics
in an open quantum system (Lindblad equation) with
two timescales, and obtain the resulting reduced dy-
namics explicitly in Lindblad form. This is important
to guarantee that the approximate model preserves the
structure of quantum states (positivity and trace). The

slow system is hence parameterized explicitly with a
quantum state on a lower-dimensional Hilbert space,
and mapped to the complete Hilbert space by a com-
pletely positive trace preserving map (Kraus map). We
have illustrated on a benchmark system (highly dissi-
pating quantum oscillator resonantly coupled to another
quantum system) how our explicit formulae directly re-
trieve the results previously obtained with lengthy ad
hoc computations.

We have obtained explicit formulae for the second-
order corrections only in the particular case of a fast
Lindbladian with single-channel damping L0, and a
slow “perturbation” in Hamiltonian form. Conceptu-
ally there should be no obstacle to extending this theory
to any Lindbladians, the key point being an appropriate
way to generalize the pseudo-inversion (L†
0L0)−1. How-
ever, the special case completed here will already al-
low to answer currently open questions about the inﬂu-
ence of small Hamiltonian perturbations on stable open
quantum systems built e.g. with engineered reservoirs
[13, 12].
