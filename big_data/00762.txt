On self-dual double circulant codes

Adel Alahmadi∗, Funda ¨Ozdemir†, Patrick Sol´e‡

Abstract

Self-dual double circulant codes of odd dimension are shown to be dihedral in even
characteristic and consta-dihedral in odd characteristic. Exact counting formulae are
derived for them and used to show they contain families of codes with relative distance
satisfying a modiﬁed Gilbert-Varshamov bound.

Introduction

It has been known for forty years that quasi-cyclic codes are good [2] in the asymptotic
sense: the product of their rate by their relative distance does not vanish when the length
goes to inﬁnity. Thirteen years ago, it was shown that even the self-dual subclass was good
[8]. A decade ago, it was proved that binary dihedral codes of rate one half were good
[1], then that their self-dual doubly even subclass is also good [10]. The last two papers
used a non-constructive probabilistic argument, where the order of 2 modulo the length is
controlled but not determined. In the present article, we will consider so-called pure double
circulant codes, that is 2-quasi cyclic codes with a systematic generator matrix consisting
of two circulant matrices. These codes have been studied in a number of papers since the
1960’s [2, 6, 15]. In particular, it is known that binary extended square codes, which form
one of the oldest and most studied family of self-dual codes, are double circulant in many
lengths [5, 12]. We will show that double circulant self-dual codes over an arbitrary ﬁnite

ﬁeld of order q are either dihedral or consta-dihedral depending on the parity of q. (A special
case of the ﬁrst statement is anticipated in [12]). While the notion of dihedral codes has
been considered by several authors, the notion of constadihedral codes has been introduced
in [15] in terms of twisted group rings. We give an alternative deﬁnition in terms of group
representations. We believe, but do not prove here that the two deﬁnitions are related.

Further, building on the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) approach of [7], we will
give exact counting formulae for these codes. From there, we will give an alternative proof
that dihedral codes are good, with codes of lengths a prime number as in [2]. Our proof
depends on Artin conjecture [11], proved under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH)
in [3]. It is however, conceptually clearer, and valid for more general alphabets than that
of [1]. Also we give a new family of good long self-dual quasi-cyclic codes. They diﬀer from
that of [8] by the index, the power of the shift under which they are invariant.

The material is organized as follows. Section 2 collects together the deﬁnitions and
notation that we need thereafter. Section 3 studies the automorphism group of self-dual
double circulant codes, ﬁrst for even then for odd characteristic. A general notion of consta-
dihedral codes is introduced in the language of representation theory. Section 4 studies the
asymptotics of double circulant self-dual codes by combining enumerative formulae with the
expurgated random coding argument made familiar by the Gilbert-Varshamov bound.

2 Deﬁnitions and notation

Let GF (q) denote a ﬁnite ﬁeld of characteristic p. In the following, we will consider codes
over GF (q) of length 2n with n odd and coprime to q. Their generator matrix G will be of
the form G = (I, A) where I is the identity matrix of order n and A is a circulant matrix
of the same order. We will call these codes double circulant. These codes are sometimes
called pure double circulant to distinguish them from bordered double circulant which are
not quasi-cyclic [14].

By a dihedral group Dn, we will denote the group of order 2n with two generators r and
s of respective orders n and 2 and satisfying the relation srs = r−1. A code of length 2n is
called dihedral if it is invariant under Dn acting transitively on its coordinate places.

If C(n) is a family of codes of parameters [n, kn, dn], the rate R and relative distance δ

are deﬁned as

and

R = lim sup

n→∞

kn
n

,

δ = lim inf

.

Both limits are ﬁnite as limits of bounded quantities. Such a family of codes is said to be
good if Rδ 6= 0.

3 Symmetry

3.1 Even q

Let q be an even prime power. Let Mn(q) denotes the set of all n × n matrices over GF (q).

Lemma 1 If A is a circulant matrix in Mn(q), then there exists an (n × n)-permutation
matrix P such that P AP = At where At denotes the transpose of A.

2 , n+3

Proof. Assume, for simplicity, that n is odd. Denote by π the permutation (1, n)(2, n −
1) · · · ( n−1
2 ). Permuting the columns of A with respect to π yields a symmetric back-
circulant matrix. Let P be the permutation matrix attached to π. The preceding explanation
shows that AP = (AP )t = P tAt, or P AP = At.

(cid:3)

Theorem 2 For n ≥ 3 odd, and q even, every self-dual double circulant code over GF (q)
of length 2n is dihedral.

Proof. Let C be a self-dual double circulant code of length 2n with generator matrix
G = (I, A). The parity-check matrix H = (At, I) is also a generator matrix of C due to
self-duality. Let P be the (n × n) permutation matrix such that P AP = At. Since left
multiplication by P amounts to changing the positions of some rows, P H = (P At, P ) is also
a generator matrix for C.

On the other hand, right multiplication of P H by P is equivalent to multiplying P H
0 P ), yielding P HP = (A, I). This right multiplication

by the block diagonal matrix ( P 0
corresponds to applying the following permutation in S2n

π = (2, n)(3, n − 1) . . . (

n + 1

2

,

n + 3

2

)(n + 2, 2n)(n + 3, 2n − 1) . . . (

3n + 1

2

)(

3n + 3

2

).

i.e. P HP = P Hπ. Moreover, we can obtain the generator matrix (I, A) from (A, I) by
applying the permutation

σ = (1, n + 1)(2, n + 2)(3, n + 3) . . . (n, 2n).

Hence C is invariant under the following product

πσ = (1, n + 1)(2, 2n)(3, 2n − 1) . . . (n − 1, n + 3)(n, n + 2).

Furthermore, since I and A are circulant matrices, C is invariant under also the permutation

τ = (1, 2, . . . , n)(n + 1, n + 2, . . . , 2n).

3

Therefore, C is invariant under the subgroup hτ, πσi of S2n. Since τ is a product of n-cycles
and πσ is a product of transpositions, we have τ n = 1 and (πσ)2 = 1. Observe that

(πσ)τ = (1, n + 2)(2, n + 1)(3, 2n)(4, 2n − 1) . . . (n − 1, n + 4)(n, n + 3).

Then we can easily obtain the following equality

(πσ)τ (πσ) = (1, n, n − 1, n − 2, . . . , 2)(n + 1, 2n, 2n − 1, . . . , n + 2) = τ −1.

Therefore, hτ, πσi is isomorphic to the dihedral group Dn.

(cid:3)

3.2 Odd q

Recall that a monomial matrix over GF (q) of order g has exactly one nonzero element per
row and per column. The monomial matrices form a group M(g, q) of order g!(q − 1)g under
multiplication. This group is abstractly isomorphic to the wreath product Zq−1 ≀ Sg.

By a monomial representation of a group G over GF (q) we shall mean a group morphism
from G into M(g, q). A code of length 2n will be said to be consta-dihedral if it is held
invariant under right multiplication by a monomial representation of the dihedral group Dn.
An alternative, but related deﬁnition can be found in [13]. We can now state the main result
of this subsection.

Theorem 3 For n ≥ 3 odd, and q odd, every self-dual double circulant code C of length 2n
over GF (q) is consta-dihedral.

Proof. Keep the matrix notations of Theorem 2. Let the generator matrix of C be
G = (I, A) with A circulant and AAt = −I. Computing AtG = (At, −I) and conjugat-
ing by P of Lemma 1 we get P AtGP = (A, −I). Deﬁne the antiswap involution a by the
rule a(x, y) = a(y, −x), where x, y are vectors of length n over GF (q). Note that a2 = −1.
Clearly a ∈ M(2n, q). Thus πa ∈ M(2n, q) and it preserves C. A monomial representation
of Dn is then hτ, πai. Thus C is consta-dihedral.

4 Asymptotics

4.1 Enumeration

In this section we give enumerative results for self-dual double circulant codes. It is impor-
tant to notice that there are 2-quasi-cyclic codes that are not double circulant. An example
in length 168 is given in [5]. Thus, the formula of [7, Prop. 6.2] does not apply.

4

We will need the following counting formula. An alternative proof for q prime can be
found in [9, Th 1.3, Th 1.3’] where the number of orthogonal circulant matrices over GF (q)
for q prime is computed. Recall that −1 is a square in GF (q), a ﬁeld of characteristic p, if
one of the following conditions holds

1. q is even

2. p ≡ 1 (mod 4)

3. p ≡ 3 (mod 4) and q is a square.

Note that [7, Prop. 6.2] we know that 2-quasi-cyclic self-dual codes, hence a fortiori

self-dual double circulant codes over GF (q) exist only if −1 is a square in GF (q).

Lemma 4 Let n denote a positive odd integer. Assume that −1 is a square in GF (q). If
xn −1 factors as a product of two irreducible polynomials over GF (q), the number of self-dual
double circulant codes of length 2n is 2(q
Proof. By the CRT approach of [7] any 2-quasi-cyclic code of length 2n over GF (q)
decomposes as the ’CRT product’ of a self-dual code C1 of length 2 over GF (q) and of a
hermitian self-dual code Cn of length 2 over GF (qn−1). To obtain a double-circulant code
we must ensure that the leftmost entry of their generator matrix G is G1,1 = 1.

2 + 1) if q is odd and (q

n−1

n−1

2 + 1) if q is even.

If q is even the only possibility for C1 is the code spanned by [1, 1]. If q is odd there are

two codes [1, a] and [1, −a] where a2 = −1.

For Cn the generator matrix is [1, b] with b such that 1 + b1+r = 0, with qn−1 = r2. By
ﬁnite ﬁeld theory, this equation in b admits 1 + r roots in GF (r2). Note that if q is even, b
ranges over the elements of order dividing 1 + r = r2
r−1 , and that if q is odd, b2 ranges over
elements of order 2(1 + r). In both cases, we use the fact that the multiplicative group of
GF (r2) is cyclic of order r2 − 1.
(cid:3)

−1

The following, more general, result is an analogue for double circulant codes of the
Proposition [7, Prop.6.2] for 2-quasi-cyclic codes. It is of interest in its own right, but not
needed for the asymptotic bounds of this section.

Proposition 5 Let n be an odd integer, and q a prime power coprime with n. Suppose that
−1 is a square in GF (q). Assume that the factorization of xn −1 into irreducible polynomials
over GF (q) is of the form

xn − 1 = α(x − 1)

with α a scalar of GF (q), n = s + 2t and gj a self-reciprocal polynomial of degree 2dj, the
polynomial hj is of degree ej and ∗ denotes reciprocation. For convenience, let g1 = x − 1

5

and, in case of n even, let g2 = x + 1. The number of self-dual 2-quasi-cyclic codes over
GF (q) is then

if q is even and n is odd.
Proof. (sketch). The part of the proof dealing with self-reciprocal polynomials gj is anal-
ogous to the previous lemma. In the case of reciprocal pairs (hj, h∗
j ), note that the number
of linear codes of length 2 over some GF (Q) admitting, along with their duals, a systematic
form is Q − 1, all of dimension 1. Indeed their generator matrix is of the form [1, u] with u
nonzero. We conclude by letting Q = qej .
(cid:3)

4.2 Arithmetic

In number theory, Artin’s conjecture on primitive roots states that a given integer q which
is neither a perfect square nor −1 is a primitive root modulo inﬁnitely many primes ℓ [11].
It was proved conditionally under GRH by Hooley [3]. In this case, by the correspondence
between cyclotomic cosets and irreducible factors of xℓ − 1 [4], the factorization of xℓ − 1
into irreducible polynomials over GF (q) contains exactly two factors, one of which is x − 1
[2].

4.3 Distance bound

We will need a q-ary version of a classical lemma from [2]. Let a(x) denote a polynomial of
GF (q)[x] coprime with xn −1, and let Ca be the double circulant code with generator matrix
(1, a). Assume the factorization of xn −1 into irreducible polynomials is xn −1 = (x−1)h(x).
We call constant vectors the codewords of the cyclic code of length n generated by h.

Lemma 6 If u is not a constant vector then there are only at most (q − 1) polynomials a
such that u ∈ Ca.
Proof. Write u = (v, w) with v, w of length n. The condition u ∈ Ca is equivalent to the
equation w = av (mod xn − 1). If v is invertible (mod xn − 1), then v is uniquely deter-
mined by this equation. If not and if u is not a constant vector the only possibility is that

6

both w and v are multiples of (x − 1). Letting v = (x − 1)v ′, and w = (x − 1)w′, yields
w′ = av ′ (mod h(x)), which gives a (mod h(x)), since v ′ is invertible (mod h(x)). Now a
(mod (x − 1)) can take q − 1 nonzero values. The result follows by the CRT applied to a,
since a, being of degree at most n−1 is completely determined by its residue (mod xn−1). (cid:3)

Recall the q−ary entropy function deﬁned for 0 < x < q−1

q by

Hq(x) = x logq(q − 1 − x logq(x) − (1 − x) logq(1 − x).

We are now ready for the main result of this section.

Theorem 7 If q is not a square, then there are inﬁnite families of self-dual double circulant
codes of relative distance

δ ≥ H −1
q (

1
4

).

Proof. Let q be ﬁxed and n a prime going to inﬁnity that satisﬁes the Artin conjecture for
q . The double circulant codes containing a vector of weight d ∼ δn or less are by standard
entropic estimates of [4] and Lemma 6 of the order of (q − 1)q2nHq(δ), up to subexponential
terms. This number will be less than the total number of self-dual double circulant codes
which is by Lemma 4 of the order of qn/2, as soon as δ is of the order of the stated bound.
(cid:3)

5 Conclusion and Open problems

In this paper, we have studied the class of double circulant self-dual codes over ﬁnite ﬁelds,
under the aspects of symmetry, enumeration, and asymptotic performance. The self-dual
condition shows that these codes in odd dimension are held invariant by the dihedral group of
order the length of the code in the even characteristic case, and by a monomial representation
of that group in the odd characteristic case.
It is possible that a similar phenomenon
occurs for n even and, more generally, for quasi-cyclic codes of higher index than two.
Further, we have derived an exact enumeration formula for this family of codes. This
formula can be interpreted as an enumeration of circulant orthogonal matrices over ﬁnite
ﬁelds, thus generalizing a result of MacWilliams [9] in the prime ﬁeld case, to general ﬁnite
ﬁelds. Our approach to asymptotic bounds on the minimum distance relies on some deep
number-theoretic conjectures ( Artin or GRH). It would be a worthwhile task to remove
this dependency by looking at lengths where the factorization of xn − 1 into irreducible
polynomials contains more than two elements.
