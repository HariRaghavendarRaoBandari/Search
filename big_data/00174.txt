ABSTRACT

Beyond Earth-like planets, moons can be habitable, too. No exomoons have been securely detected, but they could be extremely
abundant. Young Jovian planets can be as hot as late M stars, with eﬀective temperatures of up to 2000 K. Transits of their moons
might be detectable in their infrared photometric light curves if the planets are suﬃciently separated (& 10 AU) from the stars to be
directly imaged. The moons will be heated by radiation from their young planets and potentially by tidal friction. Although stellar
illumination will be weak beyond 5 AU, these alternative energy sources could liquify surface water on exomoons for hundreds of
Myr. A Mars-mass H2O-rich moon around β Pic b would have a transit depth of 1.5 × 10−3, in reach of near-future technology.

1. Introduction

Since the discovery of a planet transiting its host star (Charbon-
neau et al. 2000), thousands of exoplanets and candidates have
been detected, mostly by NASA’s Kepler space telescope (Rowe
et al. 2014). Planets are natural places to look for extrasolar life,
but moons around exoplanets are now coming more and more
into focus as potential habitats (Reynolds et al. 1987; Williams
et al. 1997; Scharf 2006; Heller et al. 2014; Lammer et al. 2014).
Key challenges in determining whether an exomoon is habitable
or even inhabited are in the extreme observational accuracies
required for both a detection, e.g., via planetary transit timing
variations plus transit duration variations (Sartoretti & Schneider
1999; Kipping 2009), and follow-up characterization, e.g., by
transit spectroscopy (Kaltenegger 2010) or infrared (IR) spectral
analyses of resolved planet-moon systems (Heller & Albrecht
2014; Agol et al. 2015). New extremely large ground-based tele-
scopes with unprecedented IR capacities (GTM, 1st light 2021;
TMT, 1st light 2022; E-ELT, 1st light 2024) could achieve data
qualities required for exomoon detections (Quanz et al. 2015).

Here I investigate the possibility of detecting exomoons tran-
siting their young, luminous host planets. These planets need to
be suﬃciently far away from their stars (& 10 AU) to be directly
imaged. About two dozen of them have been discovered around
any stellar spectral type from A to M stars, most of them at
tens or hundreds of AU from their star. The young super-Jovian
planet β Pic b (11 ± 5 times as massive as Jupiter, Snellen et al.
2014) serves as a benchmark for these considerations. Its eﬀec-
tive temperature is about 1 700 K (Baudino et al. 2014), and con-
tamination from its host star is suﬃciently low to allow for direct
IR spectroscopy with CRIRES at the VLT (Snellen et al. 2014).
Exomoons as heavy as a few Mars masses have been predicted
to form around such super-Jovian planets (Canup & Ward 2006;
Heller et al. 2014), and they might be as large as 0.7 Earth radii
for wet/icy composition (Heller & Pudritz 2015b). The transit
depth of such a moon (10−3) would be more than an order of

magnitude larger than that of an Earth-sized planet around a Sun-
like star. Photometric accuracies down to 1 % have now been
achieved in the IR using HST (Zhou et al. 2015). Hence, transits
of large exomoons around young giant planets are a compelling
new possibility for detecting extrasolar moons.

2. Star-planet versus planet-moon transits

2.1. Effectsofplanetandmoonformationontransits

Planets and moons form on diﬀerent spatiotemporal scales. We
thus expect that geometric transit probabilities, transit frequen-
cies, and transit depths diﬀer between planets (transiting stars)
and moons (transiting planets). The H2O ice line, beyond which
runaway accretion triggers formation of giant planets in the pro-
toplanetary disk (Lissauer 1987; Kretke & Lin 2007), was at
about 2.7 AU from the Sun during the formation of the local gi-
ant planets (Hayashi 1981). In comparison, the circum-Jovian
H2O ice line, beyond which some of the most massive moons
in the solar system formed, was anywhere between the orbits
of rocky Europa and icy Ganymede (Pollack & Reynolds 1974)
at 10 and 15 Jupiter radii (RJ), respectively. The ice line radius
(rice), which is normalized to the physical radius of the host ob-
ject (R), was 2.7 AU/12.5 RJ ≈ 480 times larger in the solar ac-
cretion disk than in the Jovian disk. With rice depending on R and
the eﬀective temperature (Teﬀ) of the host object as per

eﬀ ,

rice ∝ qR2 T 4
we understand this relation by comparing the properties of a
young Sun-like star (R = R
[solar radius], Teﬀ = 5000 K) with
those of a young, Jupiter-like planet (R = RJ, Teﬀ = 1000 K).

This suggests a √102 × 54 = 250 times wider H2O ice line for

the star, neglecting the complex opacity variations in both cir-
cumstellar and circumplanetary disks (Bitsch et al. 2015).

The mean geometric transit probabilities ( ¯P) of the most
massive moons should thus be larger than ¯P of the most massive
planets. Because of their shorter orbital periods, planet-moon
transits of big moons should also occur more often than stel-
lar transits of giant planets. In other words, big moons should
exhibit higher transit frequencies ( ¯f ) around planets than giant
planets around stars, on average. However, Eq. (1) does not give
us a direct clue as to the mean relative transit depths ( ¯D).

2.2. Geometrictransitprobabilities,transitfrequencies,and

transitdepths

I exclude moons around the local terrestrial planets (most no-
tably the Earth’s moon) and focus on large moons around the so-
lar system giant planets to construct an empirical moon sample
representative of moons forming in the accretion disks around
giant planets. This family of natural satellites has been suggested
to follow a universal formation law (Canup & Ward 2006). We
need to keep in mind, though, that these planets orbit the outer re-
gions of the solar system, where stellar illumination is negligible
for moon formation (Heller & Pudritz 2015a). However, many
giant exoplanets are found in extremely short-period orbits (the
“hot Jupiters”); and stellar radial velocity (RV) measurements
suggest that giant planets around Sun-like stars can migrate to
1 AU, where we observe them today. Moreover, at least one large
moon, Triton, has probably been formed through a capture rather
than in-situ accretion (Agnor & Hamilton 2006).

For the planet sample, I ﬁrst use all RV planets conﬁrmed as
of the day of writing. I exclude transiting exoplanets from my
analysis as these objects are subject to detection biases. RV ob-
servations are also heavily biased (Cumming 2004), but we know
that they are most sensitive to close-in planets because of the de-
creasing RV amplitude and longer orbital periods in wider orbits.
Thus, planets in wide orbits are statistically underrepresented in
the RV planet sample, but these planets are not equally underrep-
resented as planets in transit surveys. Transit surveys also prefer
close-in planets, as the photometric signal-to-noise ratio scales
as ∝ ntr (ntr the number of transits, Howard et al. 2012).
Mean values of ¯P (similarly of ¯f and ¯D) are calculated as
Np
¯P = (P
i Pi)/Np, where Pi is the geometric transit probability of
each individual RV planet and Np is the total number of RV plan-
ets. Standard deviations are measured by identifying two bins
around ¯P: one in negative and one in positive direction, each of
which contains 1
2 68 % = 34 % of all the planets in the distribu-
tion. The widths of these two bins are equivalent to asymmetric
1 σ intervals of a skewed normal distribution.

The geometric transit probability P = R/a, with a as the or-
bital semimajor axis of the companion. For the RV planets, ¯P =
0.028 (+0.026, −0.019).1 The ¯P value of an unbiased exoplanet
population would be smaller as it would contain more long-
period planets. On the contrary, no additional detection of a large
solar system moon is expected, and ¯P = 0.114 (+0.080, −0.045),
for the 20 largest moons of the solar system giant planets, likely
reﬂects their formation scenarios.

The transit frequency f ≈ 1/(2π)p(GM)/a3, where G is
Newton’s gravitational constant and M the mass of the central
object, assuming that M is much larger than the mass of the com-
¯f = 0.040 (+0.052, −0.037)/day.2
panion. For the RV planets,
The value of ¯f , which would be corrected for detection biases,
would be smaller with long-period planets having lower frequen-

cies. For comparison, ¯f of the 20 largest moons of the solar sys-
tem giant planets is 0.170 (+0.111, −0.030)/day.
Stellar limb darkening, star spots, partial transits, etc. aside,
the maximum transit depth depends only on R and on the ra-
dius of the transiting object (r) as per D = (r/R)2. In my cal-
culations of D, I resort to the transiting exoplanet data because
r is not known for most RV planets. For the transiting plan-
ets, ¯D = 3.00 (+4.69, −2.40) × 10−3.3 It is not clear whether
a debiased ¯D value would be larger or smaller than that. This
depends on whether long-period planets usually have larger or
smaller radii than those used for this analysis. For comparison,
¯D of the 20 largest moons of the solar system giant planets is
6.319 (+3.416, −4.543)× 10−4.
The choice of the 20 largest local moons for comparison with
the exoplanet data is arbitrary and motivated by the number of
digiti manus. Figure 1(a)-(c) shows ¯P, ¯f , and ¯D as functions of
the number of natural satellites (Ns) taken into account. Solid
lines denote mean values, shaded ﬁelds standard deviations. The
ﬁrst moon is the largest moon, Ganymede, the second moon Ti-
tan, etc., and the 20th moon Hyperion. The trends toward higher
transit probabilities (a), higher transit frequencies (b) and lower
transit depths (c) are due to the increasing amount of smaller
moons in short-period orbits. The negative slope at moons 19
and 20 in (a) and (b) is due to Nereid and Hyperion, which are
in wide orbits around Neptune and Saturn, respectively.

The key message of this plot is that ¯P(Ns = 20), ¯f (Ns = 20),
and ¯D(Ns = 20) used above for comparison with the exoplanet
data serve as adequate approximations for any sample of solar
system moons that would have been smaller because variations
in those quantities are limited to a factor of a few.

2.3. Evolutionofexomoonhabitability

An exomoon hosting planet needs to be suﬃciently far from its
star to enable direct imaging and to reduce contamination from
IR stellar reﬂection. This planet needs to orbit the star beyond
several AU, where alternative energy sources are required on
its putative moons to keep their surfaces habitable, i.e., to pre-
vent freezing of H2O. This heat could be generated by (1) tides
(Reynolds et al. 1987; Scharf 2006; Cassidy et al. 2009; Heller
& Barnes 2013), (2) planetary illumination (Heller & Barnes
2015), (3) release of primordial heat from the moon’s accretion

3 Information for both r and R was given for 1202 transiting planets.

Fig. 2. Habitable zone (HZ) of a Mars-sized moon around a Jupiter-mass (light green) and a β Pic b-like 11 MJ-mass (dark green) planet at & 5 AU
from a Sun-like star. Inside the green areas, tidal heating plus planetary illumination can liquify water on the moon surface. Values of the Galilean
moons are denoted by their initials. Left: Both HZs refer to a planet at an age of 10 Myr, where planetary illumination is signiﬁcant. Right: Both
HZs refer to a planet at an age of 1 Gyr, where planetary illumination is weak and tidal heating is the dominant energy source on the moon.

(Kirk & Stevenson 1987), or (4) radiogenic decay in its mantle
and/or core (Mueller & McKinnon 1988). All of these sources
tend to subside on a Myr timescale, but (1) and (2) can compete
with stellar illumination over hundreds of Myr in extreme, yet
plausible, cases. (3) and (4) usually contribute ≪ 1 W m−2 at the
surface even in very early stages. Earth’s globally averaged in-
ternal heat ﬂux, for example, is 86 mW m−2 (Zahnle et al. 2007),
which is mostly fed by radiogenic decay in the Earth’s interior.
The globally averaged absorption of sunlight on Earth is
239 W m−2. If an Earth-like object (planet or moon) absorbs
more than 295 W m−2, it will enter a runaway greenhouse ef-
fect (Kasting 1988). In this state, the atmosphere is opaque in
the IR because of its high water vapor content and high IR opac-
ity. The surface of the object heats up beyond 1 000 K until the
globe starts to radiate in the visible. Water cannot be liquid un-
der these conditions and the object is uninhabitable by deﬁnition.
For a Mars-sized moon, which I consider as a reference case, the
runaway greenhouse limit is at 266 W m−2, following a semian-
alytic model (Eq. 4.94 in Pierrehumbert 2010). If the combined
illumination plus tidal heating (or any alternative energy source)
exceed this limit, then the moon is uninhabitable.

On the other hand, there is a minim energy ﬂux for a moon to
prevent a global snowball state that is estimated to be 0.35 times
the solar illumination absorbed by Earth (83 W m−2, Kopparapu
et al. 2013), which is only weakly dependent on the object’s
mass. I use the terms global snowball and runaway greenhouse
limits to identify orbits in which a Mars-sized moon would be
habitable, which is similar to an approach presented by Heller &
Armstrong (2014). A snowball moon might still have subsurface
oceans, but because of the challenges of even detecting life on
the surface of an exomoon, I here neglect subsurface habitabil-
ity. I calculate the total energy ﬂux by adding the stellar visual
illumination and the planetary thermal IR radiation absorbed by
the moon to the tidal heating within the moon. Illumination is
computed as by Heller & Barnes (2015), and I neglect both stel-
lar reﬂected light from the planet and the release of primordial
and radiogenic heat. Assuming an albedo of 0.3, similar to the
Martian and terrestrial values, the absorbed stellar illumination
by the moon at 5.2 AU from a Sun-like star is 9 W m−2. I con-
sider a Jupiter-mass planet and a β Pic b-like 11 MJ-mass planet,
both in two states of planetary evolution; one, in which the sys-
tem is 10 Myr old (similar to β Pic b) and the planet is still very

hot and inﬂated; and one, in which the system has evolved to an
age of 1 Gyr and the planet is hardly releasing any thermal heat.
Planetary luminosities are taken from evolution models
(Mordasini 2013), which suggest that the Jupiter-mass planet
evolves from R = 1.28 RJ and Teﬀ = 536 K to R = 1.03 RJ and
Teﬀ = 162 K over the said period. For the young 11 MJ-mass
planet, I take R = 1.65 RJ (Snellen et al. 2014) and Teﬀ = 1 700 K
(Baudino et al. 2014). For the 1 Gyr version, I resort to the Mor-
dasini (2013) tracks, predicting R = 1.09 RJ and Teﬀ = 480 K.
Tidal heating is computed as by Heller & Barnes (2013), follow-
ing an earlier work on tidal theory by Hut (1981).

Figure 2 shows the HZ for exomoons around a Jupiter-like
(dark green areas) and a β Pic b-like planet (light green areas)
at ages of 10 Myr (left) and 1 Gyr (right). Planet-moon orbital
eccentricities (e, abscissa) are plotted versus planet-moon dis-
tances (ordinate). In both panels, the HZ around the more mas-
sive planet is farther out for any given e, which is mostly due
to the strong dependence of tidal heating on Mp. Most notably,
the planetary luminosity evolution is almost negligible in the HZ
around the 1 MJ planet. In both panels, the corresponding dark
green strip has a width of just 1 RJ, details depending on e.

The HZ around the young β Pic b, on the other hand, spans
from 18 RJ to 33 RJ for e . 0.1 (left panel). This wide range
is due to the large amount of absorbed planetary thermal illu-
mination, which is the main heat source on the moon in these
early stages. Planetary radiation scales as ∝ a−2, causing a much
smoother transition from a runaway greenhouse (at 18 RJ) to a
snowball state (at 33 RJ) than on a moon that is fed by tidal heat-
ing alone, which scales as ∝ a−9. In the right panel, planetary il-
lumination has vanished and tides have become the principal en-
ergy source around an evolved β Pic b. However, the HZ around
the evolved β Pic b is still a few times wider (for any given e)
than that around a Jupiter-like planet; note the logarithmic scale.

3. Discussion

A major challenge for exomoon transit observations around lu-
minous giant planets is in the required photometric accuracy. Al-
though E-ELT will have a collecting area 1 600 times the size of
Kepler’s, it will have to deal with scintillation. The IR ﬂux of
an extrasolar Jupiter-sized planet is intrinsically low and comes
with substantial white and red noise components. Photometric

exomoon detections will thus depend on whether E-ELT can
achieve photometric accuracies of 10−3 with exposures of a few
minutes.4 Adaptive optics and the availability of a close-by ref-
erence object, e.g., a low-mass star with an apparent IR bright-
ness similar to the target, will be essential. Alternatively, sys-
tems with multiple directly imaged giant planets would provide
particularly advantageous opportunities, both in terms of reli-
able ﬂux calibrations and increased transit detection probabili-
ties. Systems akin to the HR 8799 four-planet system (Marois
et al. 2008, 2010) will be ideal targets.

Transiting moons could also impose RV anomalies on the
planetary IR spectrum, known as the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM)
eﬀect (McLaughlin 1924; Rossiter 1924). The RM reveals the
sky-projected angle between the orbital plane of transiting object
and the rotational axis of its host, which has now been measured
for 87 extrasolar transiting planets5. E-ELT might be capable of
RM measurements for large exomoons transiting giant exoplan-
ets that can be directly imaged (Heller & Albrecht 2014).

Even nontransiting exomoons might be detectable in the IR
RV data of young giant planets. The estimated RV 1σ conﬁ-
dence achievable on a β Pic b-like giant exoplanet with a high-
resolution (λ/∆λ ≈ 100 000, λ being the wavelength of the ob-
served light) near-IR spectrograph mounted to the E-ELT could
be as low as ≈ 70 m s−1 in reasonable cases (Heller & Al-
brecht 2014). The RV amplitude of an Earth-mass exomoon in
a Europa-wide (a ≈ 10 RJ) orbit around a Jupiter-mass planet
would be 43 m s−1 with a period of 3.7 d. RV detections of super-
massive moons, if they exist, would thus barely be possible even
with E-ELT IR spectroscopy. We should nevertheless recall that
“hot Jupiters” had not been predicted prior to their detection
(Mayor & Queloz 1995). In analogy, observational constraints
could still allow for detections of a so-far unpredicted class of
hot super-Ganymedes; they might indeed be hot due to enhanced
tidal heating (Peters & Turner 2013) and/or illumination from the
young planet (Heller & Barnes 2015).

Moon eccentricities tend to be tidally eroded to zero in a few
Myr. Perturbations from other moons or from the star can main-
tain e > 0 for hundreds of Myr. With e varying in time, exomoon
habitability could be episodical. Uncertainties in the tidal quality
factor (Q) and the 2nd order Love number (k2), which scale the
tidal heating as per ∝k2/Q, can be up to an order of magnitude.
However, because of the strong dependence on a, the HZ limits
in Fig. 2 would be aﬀected by < 1 RJ.

4. Conclusions

Large moons around the local giant planets transit their planets
much more likely from a randomly chosen geometrical perspec-
tive and signiﬁcantly more often than the RV exoplanets transit
their stars. This is likely a ﬁngerprint of planet and moon forma-
tion acting on diﬀerent spatiotemporal scales. If the occurrence
rate of planets per star is similar to the occurrence rate of large
moons around giant planets (1-10 per system), the probability of
observing a moon transiting a randomly chosen giant planet is at
least four times higher than the probability of observing a planet
transiting a randomly chosen star; planet-moon transits are at
least four times more frequent than star-planets transits; the av-
erage transit depth of the transiting exoplanets is ﬁve times larger
than the average transit depth of the twenty largest moons around

like planet (20 RJ, Heller & Pudritz 2015a) take about 1 hr:13 min.

the local giant planets. However, each solar system giant planet
has at least one moon with a transit depth of 10−3. Following the
gas-starved accretion disk model for moon formation (Canup &
Ward 2006; Heller & Pudritz 2015b), a super-Ganymede around
the young super-Jovian exoplanet β Pic b could have a transit
depth of ≈ 1.5 × 10−3, which is 18 times as deep as the tran-
sit of the Earth around the Sun.
Beyond the stellar HZ, more massive planets have wider
circumplanetary HZs. The HZ for a Mars-sized moon around
β Pic b is between 18 RJ and 33 RJ for moon eccentricities e .
0.1. As the planet ages, the HZ narrows and moves in. After a
few hundred Myr, tidal heating may become the moon’s major
energy source. Owing to the strong dependence of tidal heating
on the planet-moon distance, the HZ around β Pic b narrows to a
few RJ within 1 Gyr from now, details depending on e. An exo-
moon would have to reside in a very speciﬁc part of the e-a space
to be continuously habitable over a Gyr.

The high geometric transit probabilities of moons around gi-
ant planets, their higher transit frequencies, and the possibility of
transit signals that are one order of magnitude deeper than that
of the Earth around the Sun, make transit observations of moons
around young giant planets a compelling science case for the
upcoming GMT, TMT, and E-ELT extremely large telescopes.
Most intriguingly, these exomoons could orbit their young plan-
ets in the circumplanetary HZ and therefore be cradles of life.
