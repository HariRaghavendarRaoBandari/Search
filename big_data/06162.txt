IDEMPOTENT BONDING RELATIONS ARE NONTRIVIAL IF

AND ONLY IF THEY SATISFY CONDITION Γ

STEVEN CLONTZ AND SCOTT VARAGONA

Abstract. A relation f ⊆ X 2 satisﬁes condition Γ if there exist distinct
x, y ∈ X with hx, xi, hx, yi, hy, yi ∈ f . The authors improve a previous result by
characterizing nontrivial idempotent bonding relations on compact Hausdorﬀ
spaces as those satisfying condition Γ.

1. Preliminaries

Assume X is always a compact Hausdorﬀ space.

Let a relation f ⊆ X 2 be full if ∀x ∈ X∃y ∈ X(hx, yi ∈ f ). We deﬁne a
bonding relation f ⊆ X 2 on X to be a full relation which is a closed subset of X 2.
Such relations are often alternately characterized as upper-semicontinuous (u.s.c.)
maps, which are continuous functions from X to the space H(X) of nonempty
closed subsets of X. As such let f (x) = {y ∈ X : hx, yi ∈ f }, f [A] = {y ∈ X : ∃x ∈
A(hx, yi ∈ f )}, and f 2 = f ◦ f = {hx, zi ∈ X 2 : ∃y ∈ X(hx, yi, hy, zi ∈ f )}, that is,
f 2(x) = f [f (x)].

A relation is idempotent if f = f 2.

It is surjective if for each y ∈ X, there
exists x ∈ X where hx, yi ∈ f . For A ⊆ X, let f ↾ A = {hx, yi ∈ f : x ∈ A} be
the restriction of f to A. Note that if f is idempotent then f ↾ f (x) is surjective
(onto f (x)) for all x ∈ X. Let ι = {hx, xi : x ∈ X} be the identity relation. We
say a bonding relation f is nontrivial if for some x ∈ X, f ↾ f (x) 6= ι ↾ f (x). A
single-valued bonding relation satisﬁes |f (x)| = 1 for all x ∈ X.

It’s important to note that if f is an idempotent surjective single-valued bonding
relation, then f = ι and thus is trivial. Likewise, every trivial idempotent surjection
is the single-valued identity.

However there are trivial idempotent bonding relations besides the identity: take
for instance t ⊆ {0, 1, 2}2 deﬁned by t = {h0, 0i, h1, 1i, h2, 0i, h2, 1i}. Then t ↾ f (2) =
t ↾ {0, 1} = ι; of course, t fails to map to 2 and is not surjective. By connecting the
dots the reader may sketch a version of t deﬁned for the closed interval [0, 2] ⊆ R.

Say that f satisﬁes condition Γ if there exist distinct x, y ∈ X such that hx, xi,
hx, yi, hy, yi ∈ f . The authors will show that an idempotent bonding relation is
nontrivial if and only if it satisﬁes condition Γ. This note answers their question in
[1] by generalizing their result on interval-valued idempotent relations deﬁned on
the closed interval [0, 1] ⊆ R.

2. Main Result

Lemma 1. Every nontrivial idempotent bonding relation f contains two points
hx, xi and hy, xi for distinct x, y ∈ X.

Proof. Note ﬁrst that if ι ( f , then the lemma follows immediately. So let x0 ∈ X
be a point where hx0, x0i 6∈ f .

Suppose xi is deﬁned for i ≤ n such that hxi, xj i ∈ f if and only if i < j.
So we may choose xn+1 distinct from xi for i ≤ n such that hxn, xn+1i ∈ f . If
hxn+1, xn+1i ∈ f , then the lemma is satisﬁed by x = xn+1 and y = xn. Note that
by idempotence, hxn+1, xii 6∈ f for i ≤ n as otherwise xi ∈ f (xn+1) ⊆ f (f (xn)) =
f (xn) contradicting hxn, xii 6∈ f .

Since {xn : n < ω} is an inﬁnite set in a compact Hausdorﬀ space, it has a limit
point xω. Note then that for any open neighborhood U of xω, U contains inﬁnitely
many xn, so choose i < j such that xi, xj ∈ U . Then, it follows that the basic
open neighborhood U 2 of hxω, xωi contains hxi, xji. Thus hxω, xωi is a limit point
of {hxi, xj i : i < j < ω} ⊆ f , and as f is closed, hxω, xωi belongs to f . Then
since xω 6= x0 (as hx0, x0i 6∈ f ), we may similarly show hx0, xωi is a limit point
of {hx0, xni : 0 < n < ω} ⊆ f , and therefore hx0, xωi ∈ f . The lemma is now
witnessed by x = xω and y = x0.

Lemma 2. Suppose hx, xi, hx, yi ∈ f for distinct x, y ∈ X and an idempotent
bonding relation f . Then f satisﬁes condition Γ.

Proof. Let z0 = y. If hy, yi = hz0, z0i ∈ f , we are done.

Suppose zi is deﬁned for i ≤ n such that hzi, zji ∈ f if and only if i < j, and
hx, zii ∈ f for i ≤ n. So we may choose zn+1 distinct from zi for i ≤ n such
that hzn, zn+1i ∈ f . Note that hx, zn+1i ∈ f since hx, zni, hzn, zn+1i ∈ f and thus
zn+1 ∈ f (zn) ⊆ f (f (x)) = f (x).
If hzn+1, zn+1i ∈ f , then the condition Γ is
witnessed by hx, xi, hx, zn+1i, hzn+1, zn+1i. On the other hand, hzn+1, zii 6∈ f for
i ≤ n as otherwise by idempotence zi ∈ f (zn+1) ⊆ f (f (zn)) = f (zn) contradicting
hzn, zii 6∈ f . Similarly, hzn, xi 6∈ f as otherwise hzn, xi, hx, zni ∈ f ⇒ hzn, zni ∈ f .

Since {zn : n < ω} is an inﬁnite set in a compact Hausdorﬀ space, it has a limit
point z. Note then that for any open neighborhood U of z, U contains inﬁnitely
many zn, so choose i < j such that zi, zj ∈ U . Then, it follows that the basic
open neighborhood U 2 of hz, zi contains hzi, zji. Thus hz, zi is a limit point of
{hzi, zji : i < j < ω} ⊆ f , and as f is closed, hz, zi belongs to f . We may similarly
show hx, zi is a limit point of {hx, zni : 0 < n < ω} ⊆ f , and therefore hx, zi ∈ f .

We know x 6= z since otherwise {hz0, zn+1i : n < ω} ⊆ f would imply its limit
hz0, zi = hz0, xi ∈ f , which was disproved above. Therefore hx, xi, hx, zi, hz, zi ∈ f
witness condition Γ.

Lemma 3. The inverse of an idempotent relation is also an idempotent relation.

Proof. (f −1)2 = (f 2)−1 = f −1.

(cid:3)

Theorem 4. An idempotent bonding relation is nontrivial if and only if it satisﬁes
condition Γ if and only if it contains two points hx, xi, hx, yi.

IDEMPOTENT BONDING RELATIONS ARE NONTRIVIAL IFF THEY SATISFY GAMMA 3

Proof. Obviously, if a bonding relation f has condition Γ then it contains two points
hx, xi, hx, yi. It then follows from those two points that f ↾ f (x) is not the identity,
and therefore f is nontrivial.

If f is nontrivial idempotent, then apply Lemma 1 to obtain the points hx, xi, hy, xi ∈

f . Then hx, xi, hx, yi ∈ f −1, which is idempotent by Lemma 3. So Lemma 2 may
be applied to show that f −1 has condition Γ, and therefore so does f .
(cid:3)

3. An Application

The authors used f ’s condition Γ in [1] to show that for an ordinal α, the
inverse limit lim
{I, f, α} is metrizable if and only if α is countable. Using a few
←−
unpublished results of the ﬁrst author along with the main result of this note, this
in fact generalizes to the following theorem:

Theorem 5. Let f be a nontrivial bonding relation on a compact metrizable space
X, and let L be an arbitrary total order. Then the inverse limit lim
{X, f, L} is
←−
metrizable if and only if it is Corson compact if and only if L is countable.

{X, f, L} of the metrizable space
Proof. If L is countable then the subspace lim
←−
X L is of course metrizable. If L is uncountable, note that lim
{X, f, L} contains
←−
{2, γ, L} where γ = {h0, 0i, h0, 1i, h1, 1i}. It may be shown that
the subspace lim
←−
{2, γ, L} is homeomorphic to a compact linearly ordered topological space ˇL
lim
←−
which is metrizable if and only if it is Corson compact if and only if it is second-
countable. The result follows by showing that ˇL is second-countable if and only if
L is countable.
