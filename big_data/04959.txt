ON THE BRIGHT LOOP TOP EMISSION IN POST ERUPTION ARCADES
Rohit Sharma1, Durgesh Tripathi2, Hiroaki Isobe3 and Avyarthana Ghosh2,4

ABSTRACT

The observations of post eruption arcades (PEAs) in X-rays and EUV reveal strong localised bright-
enings at the loop top regions. The origin of these brightenings and their dynamics is not well under-
stood to date. Here, we study the dynamics of PEAs using one-dimensional hydrodynamic modelling
with the focus on the the understanding of the formation of localised brightening.Our ﬁndings suggest
that these brightenings are the result of collisions between the counter-streaming chromospheric evap-
oration from both the foot points. We further perform forward modelling of the emission observed
in simulated results in various spectral lines observed by the Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope
aboard Hinode. The forward modelled intensities in various spectral lines are in close agreement with
a ﬂare observed in December 17, 2006 by EIS.

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar ﬂares are possibly the brightest and most en-
ergetic bursts occurring in the atmosphere of the Sun.
They release the high content of radiation and energetic
particles into the interplanetary medium and play a key
role in determining space-weather. Our understanding
of the physics of solar ﬂares is in a level that there ex-
ists the ”standard model”, in which plasma ejection and
magnetic reconnection play key roles (Shibata & Magara
2011), though there still remain many physical processes
that are poorly understood. One such challenge is to ex-
plain the loop top emission observed in EUV and soft
X-ray observations of post ﬂare loops or post eruption
arcades (Priest & Forbes 2002), which are considered to
be one of the best proxies for Coronal Mass Ejections
(CMEs) source regions (Tripathi et al. 2004). However,
no one-to-one correlation exists (see e.g., Ma et al. 2010;
Howard & Harrison 2013; Chen et al. 2015; Sun et al.
2015).

One of the ﬁrst observations of loop top emission in
soft X-ray images was reported by Acton et al. (1992).
Using the data taken from Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT)
(Tsuneta et al. 1991) on board Yohkoh for 10 ﬂares,
Acton et al. (1992) found presence of compact X-ray
sources at the loop tops, which were underneath the cusp-
shape structures (Forbes & Acton 1996). Studying the
ﬂare that occurred on 13th January 1992, using the ob-
servations recorded by Yohkoh SXT and hard X-ray tele-
scope (HXT) (Kosugi et al. 1991; Tsuneta et al. 1991),
Masuda et al. (1994) discovered Hard X-ray sources at
the loop top as well as the two footpoints of post ﬂare
loops. The HXR loop top observed by Masuda et al.
(1994) was located at the top of the SXR cusp detected
in the SXT images. The presence of cusp, and co-spatial
HXR emission was attributed to magnetic reconnection
processes (Forbes & Acton 1996; Priest & Forbes 2002).
However, there is no consensus on the origin of the soft

X-ray and EUV brightening at the loop top.

With the launch of Hinode,

it became possible to
observe ﬂares across a range of temperatures using
the X-Ray Telescope (XRT)and the Extreme-ultraviolet
Imaging Spectrometer (EIS). Hara et al. (2008) reported
the XRT and EIS observations of a limb ﬂare on De-
cember 17, 2006 that show a clear cusp-structure and
the loop-top brightening. With the EIS instrument,
Hara et al. (2008) could investigate the ﬂare dynam-
ics across a range of temperature. Some iron and cal-
cium spectral lines having formation temperatures from
log T = 6.0 to 6.7 is shown in Table 1.
In Fig. 1,
the panel (a) to (g) shows intensity maps for 6 iron
lines Fe X to Fe XV and Ca XVII. In the same ﬁg-
ure, the panel (h) shows zoomed maps of loop top re-
gion and contours of Fe XV and Fe XII. As can be
depicted from the Fig. 1, panel (h) and Table 1, hot-
ter plasma is located at higher coronal heights (i.e., in
the outer loops) and cooler plasma is at lower coronal
heights (in the inner loops). This is the well-known
characteristics since the Yohkoh observations (Tsuneta
1996) that is consistent with the ”standard model” with
magnetic reconnection (Yokoyama & Shibata 2001). A
number of authors have shown that the loop top
brightening is not only seen in SXR, but also in
EUV observations using narrow band imager (see e.g.,
Golub et al. 1999; Warren et al. 1999; Warren 2000;
Warren & Reeves 2001; Warren & Doschek 2006) ob-
tained by the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer
(TRACE; Handy et al. 1999). However, Hara et al.
(2008), for the ﬁrst time made a clear distinction using
the spectroscopic observations by Hinode/EIS.

There have been numerous attempts

to explain
the above described phenomenon using various ap-
proaches such as hydrodynamic modelling of multi-
ple loops (Hori et al. 1997), 1-D hydrodynamic mod-
elling in soft X-ray and EUV for SXT and TRACE
respectively (Reeves et al. 2007) and retracting loops
forming gas-dynamic
shock (Longcope et al. 2009;
Longcope & Guidoni 2011). However, there is no consen-
sus on the reason behind the observed loop top bright-
enings in SXR and EUV.

The loop top brightening can be quantiﬁed by taking
the ratios of the intensities at the loop top region and
arm regions of the coronal loop shown in the green boxes

over two coronal arm regions (Fig. 1). Table 1 shows
the intensity values and βobs at the loop top for various
spectral lines. βobs varies in the range of 1.5 to 3.7. Note
that the Fe XV is the brightest spectral line.

In order to explain the bright knots observed in EUV
post ﬂares loops with various instruments (Cheng et al.
1980; Dere et al. 1997; Widing & Hiei 1984; Golub et al.
1999; Warren 2000), Patsourakos et al. (2004) performed
a 1D hydrodynamic modelling, similar to the calculations
performed by Antiochos (1980). It was found that the
formation of these bright knots can be explained by spa-
tially localised heating that may be occurring during the
decay phase of the ﬂares rather than spatially uniform
heating.

In this study, we take a similar approach to study the
evolution of the loop top emission in post ﬂare loops ob-
served in soft X-ray and EUV observations. We further
perform forward modelling and compare our simulation
results with observations provided by EIS for the ﬂare
that was studied by Hara et al. (2008). The rest of the
paper is structures as follows. The § 2 we provide the
details of the numerical model along with initial and
boundary conditions. The section § 3 summarises the
simulation results. The role of energetics and evolution
of density, temperature and velocity is discussed for var-
ious heating inputs. Next § 4, deals with the forward
modelling of the loop tops in EIS spectral wavebands.
Lastly § 5, discusses the results and conclusions.

2. NUMERICAL MODEL

We simplify the problem to one dimensional hydrody-
namics of a semi-circular loop with constant cross section
as shown in Figure 2. To make the simulation results ob-
servationally more viable, we have taken the parameters
such as length, approximate energy deposition based on
the parameters measured for the C-class ﬂare observed
on 17th December 2006, which was studied by Hara et al.

tion of localised ﬂare heating. The total length of the loop (L) is
180 Mm. The transition region location is kept at 2 Mm.

In this simulations we solve the standard hydrody-
namic equations, which are described in Equations 1, 2
& 3 with an equation of state of ideal gas in c.g.s units.

In equation 3, H is a heating function H(s, t) that
consists of a static heating Hs and an ﬂare heating term
Hf . The functional form of H is given as:

H(s, t) = Hs(s) + Hf (s, t)

(7)

The static heating is kept constant to maintain the
corona at 2 MK. The ﬂare heating term provides the
heating due to ﬂare to which the plasma responds and
produces the dynamics in the loop. The functional form
of the ﬂare heating is given by Equation 8. In this study
we have considered the ﬂare heating to have a Gaussian
shape with a width of σ ∼ 18 Mm. The mean of the
Gaussian is placed at the loop top stop ∼ 90 Mm.

plasma in ﬂare loops with varying heating strengths.

law functions in diﬀerent temperature bands in the for-
mat Q(T ) = χ T α (ergs s−1 cm−3) and taken directly
from Hori et al. (1997).

Figure 3 shows the initial conditions for our simulation.
We have started the simulations with realistic initial con-
ditions in terms of temperature and density proﬁle for the
solar atmosphere. The system is set up in such as way
that the loop is in hydrostatic equilibrium, i.e., static
heating fully compensate the radiative cooling energy.
The initial temperature is kept at 2 MK because we are
mostly interested in active region post ﬂare loops which
are best seen in Fe XII lines forming at 2 MK. The den-
sity is then computed along the loop using the equations
of hydrostatic equilibrium.

Fig. 4.— Comparison of the diﬀerent energies in the corona
with time. The gravitational(∆EGE ) and thermal energy(∆ET E )
shown is the variation from intial gravitational and thermal energy
of the loop respectively.

We have also considered the loop to be symmetric
across its length. Considering this geometry leads us
to solve the equations only for half of the loop (from one
footpoint to the loop top). The solution of the other part
will then become the mirror image. The boundary con-
ditions are set up so that there are no gradient in tem-
perature and density at the loop top. Mathematically
the boundary condition can be written as ( ∂n
∂s )top = 0,
( ∂T
∂s )top = 0 and vtop = 0.

3. RESULTS

3.1. Overview

We have performed simulations for six diﬀerent exter-
nal heating (Hf ) applied at the loop top. The heating
input to the loop will be 2 × 109, 2 × 1010, 4 × 1010,
8 × 1010, 1.2 × 1011, 2.0 × 1011 ergs cm−2 uniformly in
a time of 100 sec each. These energy values corresponds
to the energy of a C-class ﬂare (∼ 1029 ergs) distributed
over 18 Mm length. We note that the ﬂare observed by
Hara et al. (2008) is a C-class ﬂare. A few diﬀerent val-
ues of heating strengths are chosen so as to cover two
orders of magnitude centring at C-class ﬂares strengths.
One of the ﬁrst parameters which needs to be veriﬁed
is the principle of energy conservation throughout the
simulations. We note that before the deposition of any
external heat, the system is in hydrostatic equilibrium
i.e.
the static heating in the system balances out the
radiative cooling. After the heat deposition, we have
carefully looked at the diﬀerent form of energy available
in system and their evolution.

First we discuss the energetics and dynamics of
the loop evolution for the highest heating case i.e.
2.0 × 1011 ergs cm−2 in detail. We note that same line
of arguments will follow for the other heating scenarios.
We calculate total thermal (ET E), kinetic (EKE) and
gravitational energy (EGE) in the corona. The coro-
nal part of the loop is deﬁned as the portion of the
loop above than 2 Mm. Figure 4 shows the tempo-
ral evolution of the changes in the total thermal energy
(∆ET E), total kinetic energy (∆EKE) and total gravi-
tational energy (∆EGE) in the coronal part of the loop
with respect to that at t=0. For energy component E,
∆E = E(t) − E(t = 0). There is no total kinetic energy
in the loop at t=0 as v(s) = 0, so ∆EKE = EKE.

Sharma et al.

As can be seen from the Figure 4, the thermal energy
(∆ET E) starts to increase and attains a maximum at
time ∼100 sec. This is consistent with fact that the ex-
ternal heat was supplied only for the ﬁrst 100 sec. There-
after, the thermal energy (∆ET E) shows small ﬂuctua-
tions ∼ 10% and declines sharply after ∼ 4000 sec. Simi-
larly, kinetic energy(∆EKE) also increases and attains a
maximum at around ∼60 sec. It reaches minima at time
∼ 102 sec and rises sharply reaching second maxima at
time ∼ 300 sec. Thereafter kinetic energy ﬂuctuates and
the level of ﬂuctuation in the kinetic energy is ∼ 50%.
Also, ∆EGE is nil for ﬁrst 100 sec. It starts to increase
sharply at ∼105 sec and attains a maximum at 300 sec
and later ﬂuctuate at ∼ 10% level. Afterwards, it falls
sharply at around ∼ 3500 sec.
Figure 5 plots the time evolution of density (panel a),
temperature (panel b), velocity (panel c) and pres-
sure(panel d). Note that the plots display the above
said parameters only for the half of the loop. The initial
proﬁle for all parameters is plotted at t=0. At t=40 sec,
the temperature (Fig. 5, panel (b)) of the loop top rises
to 10 MK and temperature proﬁles develops a spatially
broader proﬁle. The velocity proﬁle (Fig. 5, panel (c)) is
roughly uniformly negative in higher corona from 25 Mm
to 80 Mm and shows small bump near length ∼ 8 Mm.
At t = 132 sec, the coronal temperature proﬁle ﬂattens
to ∼ 10 MK. The velocity proﬁle develops strong positive
proﬁle reaching speeds of 200 km sec−1. The density de-
velops a steep gradient near 20 Mm and pressure proﬁle
now shows a negative dip near the same location. Since
the ﬂare heating stops at t=100 s, the coronal tempera-
ture dips (t=306 s, panel(b)). At 306 sec, the density and
pressure proﬁles (Fig. 5, panel (a) & (d)) shows a sharp
increase at the loop top and velocity (panel(c)) shows
large positive proﬁle near loop top at length ∼88 Mm.
The sharp enhancement in density propagate towards
bottom of the loop (Fig. 5, panel (a) & (d), t=476 s)
with a velocity (panel(c), t=476 s) of 120 km/sec. At
very large times t = 2040 sec, the loop cools down to
few million K. However, the density and pressure pro-
ﬁles quietens and settles. The velocity proﬁle becomes
spatially ﬂatter and negative.

The evolution of energy shown in Figure 4 as well as the
other physical parameters shown in Figure 5 can be de-
scribed as follows. As can be seen in Figure 5 panel b, the
external heat input increases the temperature (broader
bump at t=40 s), that in turn increases the thermal en-
ergy that is reﬂected in Figure 4 (dashed line). The in-
crease in thermal energy(∆ET E) creates a pressure gra-
dient from the loop top to the loop bottom (see panel d,
t=40 s) that invokes a downward velocity ﬂow or conduc-
tion front (from loop top to loop footpoint) with a speed
of 42 km/sec uniformly throughout the corona as shown
in panel c (t=40 s). Here, we describe negative velocity
as the ﬂow from top to bottom. Due to the downﬂowing
plasma, the kinetic energy(∆EKE) in system increases,
which is also reﬂected in Figure 4 (thin solid line).

The downward conduction front (downﬂow) produced
due to the pressure gradient hits the chromosphere at
∼120-130 sec and produces fast upﬂows (see Fig. 5 panel
c t=132 sec), a phenomena known as ”chromospheric
evaporation”. Due to the chromospheric evaporation,
the thermal energy(∆ET E), kinetic energy(∆EKE), as
well as the gravitational (∆EGE) show an increase. The

velocity of the chromospheric evaporation reaches up to
∼220 km sec−1. Since the loop is considered to be sym-
metric and external heat input is at the center of the loop,
the evaporation ﬂow has the same speed from both the
foot points. The evaporation ﬂows from the two points
collide at the loop top. We refer to it as primary colli-
sion of the evaporation ﬂow and it leads to a sharp incre-
ment in density at loop top (see Fig. 5 (a) t=306 sec) as
well as thermal energy (see Figure 4 dashed line). After
the primary collision, the mean kinetic energy(∆EKE)
starts to decline and show oscillatory behaviour. This
is suggestive of the fact that there may be secondary,
tertiary multiple downﬂows and upﬂows. The gravita-
tional energy(∆EGE), however, remains rather constant
until t=3500 sec, suggesting no signiﬁcant movement of
matter. Therefore, it is plausible to conclude that the
secondary and other downﬂows/upﬂows replicated in ki-
netic energy curve in Fig. 4 are weak.

At later times (∼ 2000 sec and afterwards), the density
in the corona of the loop is uniformly higher compared to
initial density proﬁle by a factor of 3. The gravitational
energy (∆EGE) remains ﬂat till 2000 sec with very small
variation (see Fig. 4). Both the thermal energy (∆ET E)
as well as gravitational energy(∆EGE) show steep de-
cline afterwards. This is suggestive of strong cooling and
draining of plasma from the corona to the chromosphere.

3.2. Dynamics of the loop for various input heats

The time evolution of density and temperature along
the loop for diﬀerent heating strengths is shown in Fig-
ures 6 & 7. The time steps shown are chosen so as to
describe the collision of primary evaporation at the loop
top. The strength of externally supplied heat is given in
the ﬁgure. As can be clearly seen in the density plots of
Fig. 6 7, the primary ﬂow collision creates an enhance-
ment in density at the loop top. With the increasing
strength of external heat, the enhancement in density in-
creases and starts to appear at earlier times. The temper-
ature proﬁle of the corona increases uniformly for large
heating inputs. To make a quantitative assessment in the
changes in density and temperature with increasing heat
input, we have deﬁned a parameter ”density increment
factor” (δ) as the ratio of the loop top density after the
collision to the ambient coronal density. The variation
of δ and loop top temperature with increasing external
heat input is given in Table 2. The table clearly reveals
that density increment factor δ as well as the loop top
temperature increases with the increasing strength of ex-
ternal heat input. We also calculate the Mach number
very close to the loop top just after the collision. For all
heating strengths the primary collision remains subsonic.

with increasing external heat input can be explained as
following. The stronger heat input creates stronger con-
duction front from loop top towards the footpoint and
dumps larger matter and energy in the chromosphere.
This leads to a stronger evaporation ﬂow. In all the case,
the coronal temperature increases till the ﬁrst 100 sec-
onds corresponding to the heat input time and then drops
as the loop cools. Later on, the coronal part of the loop
near the loop top show an enhancement in the tempera-
ture which corresponds to the time of the primary colli-
sion of the evaporation ﬂow. This temperature enhance-
ment is strongly related to enhancement in the density
(see Figures. 6 & 7). After the collision of the primary
chromospheric evaporation ﬂow, the reverse ﬂow is cre-
ated that moves towards chromosphere and collides with
secondary and tertiary ﬂows coming from the chromo-
spheric regions to coronal region. These ﬂow collisions
occur at various places in the loop depending on the ﬂow
speeds. However, these collisions are weak and the tem-
perature and density increment is less compared to the
primary collision at the loop top. We expect subsequent
reverse ﬂow collisions to be strong for asymmetric heat-
ing cases. It may explain the observation of knots seen
in EUV observations and modelled by Patsourakos et al.
(2004).

perature is expected to get reﬂected in various coro-

in this study we are only forward modelling the spectral
lines (given in Table 3) which are not density sensitive.

The contribution functions for all the lines listed in Ta-
ble 3 are plotted in Figure 8.

We have forward modelled the loop intensities in all
the spectral lines listed in Table 3 using the density and
temperatures obtained at each point along the loop. We
note that the forward modelling was only performed to
the coronal part of the loop. This is essentially due to
the fact that the assumption of optically thin atmosphere
will breakdown near the footpoint of the loop in the chro-
mosphere.

heating was switched-on and decreases afterwards.

At initial times (t ∼ 3.4 sec), where the temperature

is T ∼ 6.48 MK, the intensity of Fe XV and Ca XVII
are almost the same. As we see from Figure 8, coin-
cidently, the contribution functions of these two lines
cross each other exactly at the temperature T = 6.48
MK that can explain the equal intensity. This tempera-
ture nearly corresponds to the peak of the contribution
function of Ca XVII and lies in the far right side of that
of Fe XV. With the increase of temperature, the intensi-
ties in both the spectral lines fall. The emission in Fe XV
completely disappears when the temperature reaches to
roughly 12 MK, as this line has contribution function, al-

beit very minimal, reaching to a maximum temperature
of 10 MK. The intensity in Ca XVII also decreases but
never disappears as the contribution function of this line
goes as large as ∼ 12 MK.
After 100 seconds, i.e., when the external heating is
switched-oﬀ, the loop top starts to cool and the intensity
in Ca XVII starts to increase, as we move towards the
peak of it’s contribution function. The emission from
Fe XV also reappears, albeit later (at t= 101 sec). At
t=300 sec, the temperature show a slight enhancement
due to the primary collision of the evaporation ﬂow (as
explained in 3.2 and shown Figure 7). Correspondingly,
the intensities in Fe XV and Ca XVII show a slight dip
followed by a very sharp increase, which is about two
orders of magnitude higher. This sharp enhancement in
the intensities coincide with the time of the collision of
the primary evaporation ﬂow collision as well as the en-
hancement in the density. Later on, the temperature falls
and shows many bumps before it dies out. The intensity
in Ca XVII remains similar with some ﬂuctuations till
t=1000 s and falls sharply afterwards. Whereas, the in-
tensity of Fe XV keeps increasing with oscillations all the
way till t=3000 s that corresponds to a temperature of
3 MK. The oscillations in the intensities of Ca XVII as
well as in Fe XV corresponds well to the times of bumps
see the temperature proﬁle. These oscillations are essen-
tially due to the collisions of the subsequent evaporation
ﬂows. The fall of intensities of these two lines corre-
sponds to the cool-ward fall of their contribution func-
tion. The spectral lines Fe XII, Fe XI and Fe X appears
at times t=1040, 1150, 1180 sec respectively and they
do not fade away till the end of simulation. As the loop
cools, the other spectral lines gain in the contribution
function and results in the enhancement in their intensi-
ties. Also note that the appearance of Fe XII preceded
that of Fe X appears, which can be attributed to their
corresponding contribution function.

After the primary collision (t=304 sec), the dips in the
temperature correlates with the peaks in the intensities
of Fe XV, Fe XII, Fe XI and Fe X. Whereas, reverse is
true for Ca XVII as temperature dips correlates with the
Ca XVII intensity dips. This is essentially due to the fact
that the temperature of the loop top is less than 5.6 MK

(peak formation temperature of Ca XVII) and it falls on
the positive slope of the contribution function of Ca XVII
and negative slope of that of Fe XV, Fe XII, Fe XI and
Fe X lines (see Figure 8). If temperature lies in negative
slope in G(T) curve, any increase in the temperature
should show decreases in the intensities of these lines and
vice versa. However, we can see in Figures 6 and 7 , the
collision of evaporation ﬂows also enhances the densities
that could in turn enhance the emission measure thereby
showing the increase in the intensities. The factor of
increment of densities δ for this largest heating case is
2.17 seen in Table 2.

Figure 10 displays the evolution of intensities at the
loop top for diﬀerent heating strengths.
In the ﬁgure,
the bold black solid line correspond to the temperature
of the top, dashed-dotted green line is intensity of Fe XV
lines, the dashed blue line is the intensity of Ca XVII
line, dotted red line is the intensity of Fe XII, thin solid
yellow line is the intensity of Fe XI and thick dashed ma-
genta line is the intensity of Fe X. While explaining the
evolution of loop top emission in various lines, similar
argument will follow as is given earlier for the highest
heating case. As we can see, the appearance and disap-
pearance of the emission in various spectral lines corre-
sponds well with their respective contribution functions.
For example, for the lowest heating case, the emission in
Ca XVII appears for a very short duration, only at the
time of peak temperature achieved during heating. Af-
terwards, the emission on Ca XVII dies down. Similarly,
the Fe X line appears strongly for the lower heating case
much earlier than it appears in the higher heating case
(see Figure 10).

We have provided the density increment factor (δ) due
to primary collision of the evaporation ﬂow in Table 2.
Corresponding increment in the forward modelled inten-
sities (βsim) in various spectral lines are given in Table 4.
Similar to the deﬁnition of density increment factor, the
intensity increment factor (βsim) is also deﬁned as the ra-
tio of intensities at the loop top followed by the primary
collision and to the ambient coronal intensity.

The intensity increment factor depends on the temper-
ature of the loop top and densities. As density increment
factor (δ) increases with input heat(Table 2), we obtain
larger βsim for all spectral lines (Table 4). So in all times,
the density become most important in increasing loop top

intensity at the time of primary collision. The tempera-
ture of the loop top also decides the intensity increment
or decrement as seen in Fig 10 depending on the position
on the contribution function (Fig 8).

As can be seen from the table, the loop top temper-
ature can reach up to ∼ 10 MK for Ca XVII for high-
est heating.
It created the maximum intensity incre-
ment of about a factor of 4.4 for Ca XVII. The typical
βsim is in the range ∼ 1.5 − 3.5, considering all heating
strengths and are close to brightness factor in observa-
tion βobs (Table 1). But among all heating inputs, the
8.0 × 1010 ergs cm−2 input heat case’s loop top incre-
ment βsim shows the closest resemblance with the βobs

for all spectral lines, except Fe XI. The case of 1.2 × 1011
ergs cm−2 is closest to Fe XI. Hotter lines produces larger
increments βsim than cooler lines and it increases as in-
put heat increases. In Table 1, this trend does show up
from Fe XIII to Ca XVII. In simulations the Fe XV line
(Fig. 10, dashed green curve) is dominant for all heat-
ing strengths in post-ﬂare times, which is in agreement
with the loop top intensity of the observation (Table 1).
We note here that there may not be any one-to-one cor-
relation between the observations and forward modelled
results. This could be due to the limitations of the sim-
ulations and forward modelling. In the simulations, the
dynamics corresponding to one loop strand is being stud-
ied, whereas in simulations there will be a collection of

5. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In this paper we have addressed the long standing
problem of localised loop top brightening in post ﬂare
loops observed in soft X-ray and EUV. We performed a
1D hydrodynamic simulation and forward modelled the
intensities in a few spectral lines (see Table 3) observed
by EIS. Our results show that the external heating ap-
plied at the loop top produces evaporations ﬂows form
chromosphere (Fig. 6 & 7). These ﬂows collide at the
loop top and enhance the density at the top. This can
be clearly seen as increase in the intensities in various
spectral lines (Fig. 10). This idea of density enhance-
ment in coronal loops due to chromospheric evaporation
is also supported in recent studies such as Takasao et al.
(2015) and reference therein. Moreover, once the heat-
ing is switched-oﬀ, the temperature of the loop top drops
sharply due to enhanced radiative cooling. The decline
in temperature is larger for stronger heating cases. This
is essentially due to the fact that evaporation ﬂows are
stronger bringing more mass in the loops thereby increas-
ing the density. We ﬁnd that temperature of the loop top
is important parameter which determines loop top inten-
sity in post ﬂare times. However, the density increments
δ (see Table 2) are also proportional to the strength of
loop top intensities (Table 4). The intensity increments
(βsim) at the time of primary collision are close to obser-
vations βobs (Table 1). Our forward modelling shows that

Fe XV to the strongest lines for all the heating strengths
in the post ﬂare loops. This is consistent with the ob-
servations provided by Hara et al. (2008) as shown in
Table 1.
In post ﬂare times, the cooler spectral lines
Fe XII,Fe XI and Fe X appears in the decreasing order of
their formation temperatures.

Finally, we conclude that larger external heating pro-
duces stronger the evaporation and therefore, creates
stronger the loop top brightening in hotter lines. There-
fore, the post ﬂare loops formed in higher energetic ﬂare
cases will appear brighter. We know that most of the
strong ﬂares are observed from complex magnetic re-
gions, for example active regions. However, the low en-
ergy ﬂares are often observed from quiescent part of sun’s
disk.
In these cases, a post ﬂare loop formed due to
ﬂare eruption of a subsequent CMEs may not be bright
enough to be observed. Further investigations regarding
eﬀects of various parameters such as heating locations,
geometry of the loops as well the length and cross sec-
tions are required and is under progress.
In addition,
more observational study are required to provide quanti-
tative constrains on the relative brightening in diﬀerent
spectral lines.
