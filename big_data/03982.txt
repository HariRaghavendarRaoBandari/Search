Abstract

Through the application of layer potential techniques and Gohberg-Sigal theory we derive
an original formula for the Minnaert resonance frequencies of arbitrarily shaped bubbles. We
also provide a mathematical justiﬁcation for the monopole approximation of scattering of
acoustic waves by bubbles at their Minnaert resonant frequency. Our results are comple-
mented by several numerical examples which serve to validate our formula in two dimensions.

The purpose of this work is to understand acoustic wave propagation through a liquid containing
bubbles. Our motivation is the use of bubbles in medical ultrasonic imaging as strong sound
scatterers at particular frequencies known as Minnaert resonances. Many interesting physical
works have been devoted to the acoustic bubble problem; see, for instance, [10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21].
Nevertheless, the characterization of the Minnaert resonances for arbitrary shaped bubbles has
been a longstanding problem.

In this paper we derive an original formula for the Minnaert resonances of bubbles of arbi-
trary shapes using layer potential techniques and Gohberg-Sigal theory [4]. Our formula can be
generalized to multiple bubbles. We provide a mathematical justiﬁcation for the monopole ap-
proximation and demonstrate the enhancement of the scattering in the far ﬁeld at the Minnaert
resonances. We show that there is a correspondence between bubbles in water and plasmonic
nanoparticles in that both raise similar fundamental questions [7]. However, the mathematical
formulation of Minnaert resonances is much more involved than the formulation of plasmonic
resonances.

The Minnaert resonance is a low frequency resonance in which the wavelength is much larger
than the size of the bubble [12]. Our results in this paper have important applications. They can

be used to show that at the Minnaert resonance it is possible to achieve superfocusing of acoustic
waves or imaging of passive sources with a resolution beyond the Rayleigh diﬀraction limit [5, 6].
Foldy’s approximation applies and yields to the conclusion that the medium surrounding the
source behaves like a high contrast dispersive medium [13]. As the dispersion is small, it has
little eﬀect on the superfocusing and superresolution phenomena. Eﬀective equations for wave
propagation in bubbly liquids have been derived in the low frequency regime where the frequency
is much smaller than the Minneart resonance frequency [8, 9, 16]. In this paper, however, we
are more concerned with wave propagation in the resonant regime.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we consider the scattering of acoustic waves in
three dimensions by a single bubble and derive its Minnaert resonances in terms of its capacity,
volume, and material parameters. In Section 3 we derive the point scatterer approximation of
the bubble in the far-ﬁeld. In Section 4 we perform numerical simulations in two dimensions to
illustrate the main ﬁndings of this paper. The paper ends with some concluding remarks. In
Appendix A, we collect some useful asymptotic formulas for layer potentials in two and three
dimensions. Derivations of the two-dimensional Minnaert resonances are given in Appendix B.

2 The Minnaert resonance

We consider the scattering of acoustic waves in a homogeneous media by a bubble embedded
inside. Assume that the bubble occupies a bounded and simply connected domain D with
∂D ∈ C1,s for some 0 < s < 1. We denote by ρb and κb the density and the bulk modulus of the
air inside the bubble, respectively. ρ and κ are the corresponding parameters for the background
media R3\D. The scattering problem can be modeled by the following equations:

By choosing proper physical units, we may assume that the size of the bubble is of order 1
and that the wave speeds outside and inside the bubble are both of order 1. Thus the contrast
between the wave speeds is not signiﬁcant. We assume, however, that there is a large contrast
in the bulk modulii. In summary, we assume that δ (cid:28) 1 and τ = O(1).
single layer potential S k

We use layer potentials to represent the solution to the scattering problem (2.1). Let the

D associated with D and wavenumber k be deﬁned by
S k
D[ψ](x) =

G(x, y, k)ψ(y)dσ(y),

x ∈ ∂D,

condition. We also deﬁne the boundary integral operator Kk,∗

D by

x ∈ ∂D.

Then the solution u can be written as

u(x) =

x ∈ D,

(2.4)

for some surface potentials ψ, ψb ∈ L2(∂D). Using the jump relations for the single layer
potentials, it is easy to derive that ψ and ψb satisfy the following system of boundary integral
equations:

(cid:32)

One can show that the scattering problem (2.1) is equivalent to the boundary integral equa-
tions (2.5).
Throughout the paper, we denote by H = L2(∂D)×L2(∂D) and by H1 = H 1(∂D)×L2(∂D),
and use (·,·) for the inner product in L2 spaces and || || for the norm in H. Here, H 1 is the
standard Sobolev space. It is clear that A(ω, δ) is a bounded linear operator from H to H1, i.e.
A(ω, δ) ∈ L(H,H1).

The resonance of the bubble in the scattering problem (2.1) can be deﬁned as all the complex
numbers ω with negative imaginary part such that there exists a nontrivial solution to the
following equation:

A(ω, δ)[Ψ] = 0.

(2.6)

These can be viewed as the characteristic values of the operator-valued analytic function (with
respect to ω) A(ω, δ). We are interested in the quasi-static resonance of the bubble, or the
resonance frequency at which the size of the bubble is much smaller than the wavelength of
the incident wave outside the bubble. In some physics literature, this resonance is called the

3

Minnaert resonance. Due to our assumptions on the bubble being of size order one, and the
wave speed outside of the bubble also being of order one, this resonance should lie in a small
neighborhood of the origin in the complex plane. In what follows, we apply the Gohberg-Sigal
theory to ﬁnd this resonance.

We ﬁrst look at the limiting case when δ = ω = 0. It is clear that

with φ0 = χ∂D and the constant β0 being chosen such that (cid:107)Φ0(cid:107) = 1.

The above lemma shows that ω = 0 is a characteristic value for the operator-valued analytic
function A(ω, δ). By the Gohberg-Sigal theory [4], we can conclude the following result about
the existence of the quasi-static resonance.

Lemma 2.2. For any δ, suﬃciently small, there exists a characteristic value ω0 = ω0(δ) to the
operator-valued analytic function A(ω, δ) such that ω0(0) = 0 and ω0 depends on δ continuously.
This characteristic value is also the quasi-static resonance (or Minnaert resonance).

We next perform asymptotic analysis on the operator A(ω, δ). Using the results in Appendix

A, we can derive the following result.
Lemma 2.3. In the space L(H,H1), we have
A(ω, δ) := A0 + B(ω, δ) = A0 + ωA1,0 + ω2A2,0 + ω3A3,0 + δA0,1 + δω2A2,1 + O(ω4) + O(δω3),

Our main result in this section is stated in the following theorem.

Theorem 2.1. In the quasi-static regime, there exists two resonances for a single bubble:

where V ol(D) is the volume of D and Cap(D) := −(ψ0, χ∂D) = −(S−1
of D. The ﬁrst resonance ω0,0 is called the Minnaert resonance.

D [χ∂D], χ∂D) is the capacity

Proof. Step 1. We ﬁnd the resonance by solving the following equation

A(ω, δ)[Ψδ] = 0.

Write Ψδ = Ψ0 + Ψ1 and assume the orthogonality condition

Step 2. Since ˜A0 = A0 + P0, (2.8) is equivalent to the following

(Ψ1, Ψ0) = 0.

( ˜A0 − P0 + B)[Ψ0 + Ψ1] = 0.

(2.8)

(2.9)

Observe that as the operator ˜A0 + B is invertible for suﬃciently small δ and ω, we can apply
( ˜A0 + B)−1 to both sides of the above equation to deduce that

Ψ1 = ( ˜A0 + B)−1P0[Ψ0] − Ψ0 = ( ˜A0 + B)−1[Φ0] − Ψ0.

Step 3. Using the orthogonality condition (2.9), we arrive at the following equation:

(cid:16)

A(ω, δ) :=

( ˜A0 + B)−1[Φ0], Ψ0

(cid:17) − 1 = 0

This complete the proof of the theorem.

A few remarks are in order.

Remark 2.1. Using the method developed above, we can derive the Minnaert resonance for a
single bubble in two dimensions. The main diﬀerences between the two-dimensional case and the
three-dimensional case are explained in Appendix B.

Remark 2.2. Using the method developed above, we can also obtain the full asymptotic expan-
sion for the resonance with respect to the small parameter δ.

Remark 2.3. In the case of a collection of N identical bubbles, with separation distance much
larger than their characteristic sizes, the Minnaert resonance for a single bubble will be split into
N resonances. The splitting will be related to the eigenvalues of a N-by-N matrix which encodes
information on the conﬁguration of the N bubbles. This can be proved by a similar argument as
in [5].

Remark 2.4. Taking into consideration the above theorem, we can deduce that if the bubble is
represented by D = tB for some small positive number t and a normalized domain B with size
of order one, then the Minnaert resonance for D is given by the following formula

3 The point scatterer approximation
We now solve the scattering problem (2.1) with uin = eikd·x. This models the case when the
bubble is excited by sources in the far ﬁeld (throughout the paper, a point x is said to be in the
far ﬁeld of the bubble D if the distance between x and D is much larger than the size of D).
The problem is equivalent to equation (2.5) with F being determined by

We need the following lemma.

point-wise behavior

Proof. Step 1. We write Ψ = αuin(y0)Ψ0 + Ψ1 with (Ψ1, Ψ0) = 0. Then,

( ˜A0 − P0 + B)[αuin(y0)Ψ0 + Ψ1] = F

implies that

which yields

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

[αuin(y0)Ψ0 + Ψ1] = ( ˜A0 + B)−1[F ],

αuin(y0)Ψ0 + Ψ1 − αuin(y0)( ˜A0 + B)−1Φ0 = ( ˜A0 + B)−1[F ].

10

As a result, we get

αuin(y0) =

Ψ1 = ( ˜A0 + B)−1[F ] + αuin(y0)( ˜A0 + B)−1[Φ0] − αuin(y0)Ψ0.

By Lemma 3.1, we have

Ψ1 = uin(y0)

+ O(ω) + O(δ).

4 Numerical illustrations

In this section we perform numerical simulations in two dimensions to analyze the resonant
frequencies for two scenarios. We ﬁrst analyze the single bubble case for which a formula was
derived in Theorem B.1. We then calculate the resonant frequencies for two bubbles and compare
our results with the single bubble case.

4.1 Resonant frequency of a single bubble in two dimensions

To validate the Minnaert resonance formula (B.6) in two dimensions we ﬁrst determine the
characteristic value ωc of A(ω, δ) in (2.6) numerically. We then calculate the complex root ωf
of (B.6) that has a positive real part. Comparing ωc and ωr over a range of appropriate values
of δ allows us to judge the accuracy of the formula.

In order to perform the analysis in the correct regime, which was described in Section 2, we
take ρ = κ = 1000 and ρb = κb = c, where c is chosen such that the wave speed in both air
and water is of order 1 and δ ∈ {10−i}, i ∈ {1, . . . , 5}. We use 29 points to discretize the unit
circle used in the calculation of the layer potentials that form A. Calculating ωc is equivalent
to determining the smallest ω such that A(ω, δ) has a zero eigenvalue. We have

ωc = min

ω∈C{ω| λ(ω) = 0} λ ∈ σ(A(ω, δ)),

and we approach λ(ω) = 0 as a complex root ﬁnding problem which can be calculated using
Muller’s method [4, 24]. Muller’s method is applied again in order to ﬁnd the root ωf satisfying
(B.6). The resonant frequencies ωc and ωf , along with the relative errors, for speciﬁc values of
δ are given in Table 1. In Figure 1 it can be seen that the relative error becomes very small
when δ (cid:28) 1, conﬁrming the excellent accuracy of the formula. In particular, we note that when
δ = 10−3, which is close to the usual contrast between water and air, the diﬀerence between ωc
and ωf is negligible with a relative error of only 0.0652%.

4.2 Resonant frequencies of two bubbles in two dimensions

In this subsection we numerically solve the two bubble case and analyze it with respect to our
results for the Minnaert resonance of a single bubble. In the case of two bubbles we have two
resonant frequencies, ωs and ωa, that correspond to the normal modes of the system [26]. These
frequencies are not in general equal to the one bubble resonant frequency ωc. The interaction
between the bubbles gives rise to a shift in the resonance frequencies. The symmetric mode ωs
typically shows a downward frequency shift and occurs when the bubbles oscillate (collapse and
expand) in phase, essentially opposing each other’s motion. The antisymmetric mode ωa shows
an upward frequency shift and occurs when the bubbles oscillate in antiphase, facilitating each
other’s motion.
To account for the interaction between the two bubbles the matrix A in (2.5) is replaced

with

The variation in the eigenvalues of A2 with respect to the input frequency, and hence the
shifting of the resonant frequencies, is highly sensitive to the ratio of δ = ρb/ρ to κb/κ, with
it being at a minimum when these quantities are equal.
In order to make the results more
clearly visible, while keeping the simulation in the correct regime, let us take ρb = 1.1 and
κb = 0.1. For reference, we note that the resonant frequency for a single bubble in this regime

Figure 2: When the bubbles are close together the resonance may be much more pronounced. Here we
have |λ| as the distance varies from d = 0.1 (blue dots) to d = 0.5 (orange dots) and (cid:61)(ω) = −0.0008i.
We have resonance at the symmetric mode ωs ≈ 0.0041 − 0.0008i when d = 0.1. The resonant frequency
of a single bubble is ωc = 0.01856427 − 0.00387243i.

We now identify three regimes in terms of bubble separation distance d. The ﬁrst occurs
due to strong interaction when d is less than the radius of the bubbles.
In this regime the
resonant frequency shift may be much more pronounced. For example, when d = 0.1 we have
ωs ≈ 0.0041 − 0.0008i, while ωa ≈ 0.7435 + 0.0032i. This regime is shown in Figure 2 for
(cid:61)(ω) = −0.008i.

When d is greater than the radius of the bubbles, yet not very large, we have a somewhat
It is natural to expect
stable regime featuring small to moderate resonant frequency shifts.
that as the distance between the bubbles increases, the eigenvalues of the two bubble system
approach those of the single bubble system. And indeed that is the case as can be seen in Figure
3 where ω has been restricted to R.
As with the three dimensional case, however, we require a complex ω with negative imaginary
part in order for A or A2 to become singular. This can be seen in Figure 4 for d = 10 and d = 100.
Table 2 shows that the normal modes are quite close to the single bubble resonant frequency in
this regime.

The ﬁnal regime occurs when the separation distance becomes very large compared to the
radius of the bubbles.
In this situation the sensitivity of the Hankel function in the layer
potentials to negative imaginary numbers becomes apparent, leading to a much wider variation
in the eigenvalues of A2. Similarly to when the bubbles are very close together, we observe
signiﬁcant resonant frequency shifts in this regime. When d varies from 100 to 1000 we obtain

5 Concluding remarks

In this paper we have investigated the acoustic wave propagation problem in bubbly media
and for the ﬁrst time rigorously derived the low frequency resonances. Furthermore, we have
provided a justiﬁcation for the monopole approximation. The techniques developed in this
paper open a door for a mathematical and numerical framework for investigating acoustic wave
propagation in bubbly media. In forthcoming papers we will investigate the superabsorption
eﬀect that can be achieved using bubble metascreens [20, 22]. We will also mathematically
justify Foldy’s approximation and quantify time-reversal and the superfocusing eﬀect in bubbly
media probed at their Minnaert resonant frequency [19]. Finally, we will develop accurate and
fast numerical schemes for solving acoustic wave propagation problems in the presence of closely
spaced bubbles.

A Some asymptotic expansions

increases as the dots change from blue to orange. Although the eigenvalues of A2 approach those of A as
the distance increases, they don’t go to zero when ω is real. Here, σ(A) and A2 are the spectra of A and
σ(A2), respectively.

Figure 4: The eigenvalues of A (black crosses) and A2 (blue and green dots) may go to zero in the

The frequency shift is less pronounced when d = 100 as opposed to d = 10 due to the decrease in the
interaction of the bubbles with each other.

B The Minnaert resonance in two dimensions

In this section, we derive the Minnaert resonance for a single bubble in two dimensions using
the same method we developed for the three-dimensional case. The main diﬀerences between
the two-dimensional case and the three-dimensional case are as follows: (1) the single layer
potential SD may not be invertible from L2(∂D) to H 1(∂D) in two dimensions, while this
property always holds in three dimensions. We refer to [4, 25] for more detail on this issue; (2)
there is a logarithmic singularity in the asymptotic expansion of the single layer potential S k
for small k. These create some diﬃculties which we address here.

where ˆS k

Note that the kernel space of the operator − 1

D has dimension one. We chose ψ0
to be the real-valued function in this kernel space which has unit norm in L2(∂D). We have
K∗
D[ψ0] = 1

2 ψ0. One can show that

2 Id + K∗

SD[ψ0] = γ0χ∂D

(B.2)

for some constant γ0 (see [4, 25]). Here and after, we also denote by φ0 = χ∂D. There are two
cases:

(i) Case I: γ0 = 0.
(ii) Case II: γ0 (cid:54)= 0.
In case I, it is clear that SD is not invertible from L2(∂D) to H 1(∂D). In case II, we can show
that SD is invertible from L2(∂D) to H 1(∂D).
We remark that (χ∂D, ψ0) (cid:54)= 0. Indeed, assume on the contrary that (χ∂D, ψ0) = 0. Then

(SD[ψ0], ψ0) = γ0(χ∂D, ψ0) = 0,

which further implies that ψ0 = 0. This contradiction proves our assertion.
Lemma B.1. In both cases, the operator ˆS k
Proof. We ﬁrst show that ˆS k

D is invertible in L(L2(∂D), H 1(∂D)).

D is injective. Assume that
ˆS k
D[y] = SD[y] + ηk(y, χ∂D)χ∂D = 0

for some y ∈ L2(∂D).

In Case I, we have SD[y] ⊥ ψ0 in L2(∂D), therefore, ηk(y, χ∂D)(χ∂D, ψ0) = 0. Since (χ∂D, ψ0) (cid:54)=
0, we obtain (y, χ∂D) = 0. It follows that SD[y] = 0. But this implies that y = cψ0 for some
constant c. Using the condition (y, χ∂D) = 0 again, we derive c = 0, which shows that y = 0.
In Case II, we have SD[ψ0] (cid:54)= 0. Since SD[y] = −ηk(y, χ∂D)χ∂D, we see that y = cψ0 for

some constant c. Therefore,

γ0c + ηkc(ψ0, χ∂D) = c(γ0 + ηk(ψ0, χ∂D)) = 0.

Note that γ0 + ηk(ψ0, χ∂D) (cid:54)= 0, which follows from the fact that both γ0 and (ψ0, χ∂D) are real
numbers while ηk is a complex number with nonzero imaginary part. Thus we have c = 0, and
y = 0 follows immediately.
The surjectivity of ˆS k

D follows from the fact that ˆS k

D is Fredholm with index zero. This

completes the proof of the lemma.

We have the following properties for the operator A0.

Lemma B.2. We have

23

(i) Ker(A0) = span{Ψ0} where

(cid:18) 0

(cid:19)

with φ0 = χ∂D and the constant β0 being chosen such that (cid:107)Φ0(cid:107) = 1.

Proof. We ﬁrst ﬁnd the kernel space of A0. Assume that

D)[yb] = 0.

Id + K∗

(− 1

(B.3)

(B.4)

From (B.4), we see that yb is a multiple of ψ0. We let yb = ψ0. We now ﬁnd the function y.

In Case I, we have SD[yb − y] ⊥ ψ0. Similarly to the proof in Lemma B.1, we can derive that

y = cψ0 for some constant c which satisﬁes

ηkb(ψ0, χ∂D) − ηkc(ψ0, χ∂D) = 0.

Thus, it follows that c = ηkb/ηk.

In Case II, SD is invertible. From (B.3), we can derive that ψ0 − y is a multiple of ψ0, which

further implies that y = cψ0 for some constant c. Plugging this back to (B.3), we obtain

(1 − c)γ0 + ηkb(ψ0, χ∂D) − ηkc(ψ0, χ∂D) = 0.

Therefore,

c =

γ0 + (ψ0, φ0)ηkb
γ0 + (ψ0, φ0)ηk

.

Note that γ0 + (ψ0, φ0)ηk (cid:54)= 0 because the ηk has nonzero imaginary part. This completes the
proof of the ﬁrst part of the Lemma.

The second part of the Lemma follows easily from the fact that the operator ˆS k

D is injective.

This complete the proof of the Lemma.

We next perform an asymptotic analysis in terms of δ and ω of the operator A(ω, δ).

We deﬁne a projection P0 by

˜A0 = A0 + P0.

With the help of Lemma B.1, we can establish the following results.

Lemma B.4. We have
(i) The operator ˜A0 is a bijective operator in L(H,H1). Moreover, ˜A0[Ψ0] = Φ0;
(ii) ˜A0

is a bijective operator in L(H,H1). Moreover, ˜A0

[Φ0] = Ψ0.

Our main results in two dimensions are summarized in the following theorem.

Theorem B.1. In the quasi-static regime, there exist resonances (or the Minnaert resonance)
for a single bubble. Their leading order terms are given by the roots of the following equation:

where the constants b1, c1 are deﬁned in Section A.2, γ0 in (B.2) and a in Lemma B.2.

Proof. As in Theorem 2.1, we can show that the resonances are the roots of the following
equations

(cid:16)

A(ω, δ) :=

( ˜A0 + B)−1[Φ0], Ψ0

(cid:17) − 1 = 0.

By a direct calculation, we further have

A(ω, δ) = −ω2 ln ω (A1,1,0[Ψ0], Φ0) − ω2 (A1,2,0[Ψ0], Φ0)
−δ (A0,1[Ψ0], Φ0) + O(ω4 ln ω) + O(δω2 ln ω).
