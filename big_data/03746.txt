Abstract.

It is shown, for the ﬁrst time, that negative refraction with positive phase velocity
refraction can be realized (and controlled) over a wide range of frequency on the ﬁrst
(lowest) pass band of simple photonic and phononic crystals.

First a uniﬁed approach is presented to accurately, eﬃciently, and uniquely produce
the homogenized eﬀective material properties of doubly periodic phononic crystals for
anti-plane shear (SH) and photonic crystals for transverse electric (TE) and transverse
magnetic (TM) electromagnetic Bloch-form waves in such a manner that they exactly
reproduce the band structure of the composite over any desired frequency band. Then
the correspondence between phononic and photonic ﬁeld equations is established and
their eﬀective homogenized material parameters are calculated. Finally illustrative
examples are worked out for each case, revealing a rich body of refractive characteristics
of these crystals, and showing by means of these examples that the homogenized
eﬀective parameters do yield the exact results, and that the resulting homogenized
medium does in fact embody exactly the actual band structure and dispersive properties
of the considered phononic/photonic crystal. As a consequence when the homogenized
medium is placed in contact with a normal homogeneous half-space,
it could display,
even on the ﬁrst pass band, positive, negative, or even no energy refraction depending
on the frequency and wave vector of plane waves incident from the normal homogeneous
solid to the interface.

The unit cell of the crystal may consist of anisotropic constituents of any constant or
variable properties that may also admit large discontinuities. The actual calculation
procedure is detailed in Appendix A, where, for elliptical and rectangular inclusion
geometries, analytical expressions are also given to assist the calculation of the key
quantities.

1. Introduction

2

A representative volume element (RVE) of any heterogeneous material may be viewed
as a unit cell of a periodic composite. But photonic and phononic crystals with their
periodic arrangement of identical unit cells of structured constituent geometry and
material properties, uniquely posses a wealth of special elastodynamic/electromagnetic
characteristics that are not shared by an arbitrary RVE. These crystals display band
structure and have dispersion responses that vary with frequency and wave vector,
(Yablonovitch et al. 1991), (Plihal & Maradudin 1991), (Kushwaha et al. 1993),
(Pendry 1994), (Sukhovich et al. 2008), (Nemat-Nasser 2015a), (Nemat-Nasser 2015b).
The overall response of these crystals is fully deﬁned by the geometry and material
properties of their typical unit cell. Therefore, their homogenized eﬀective properties
for Bloch-form waves (Bloch 1928) can be calculated by simple spatial volume averaging
of the ﬁeld variables over a typical unit cell in such a manner that both continuity and
periodicity are preserved. This approach was introduced in (Willis 2009), (Nemat-
Nasser et al. 2011) for one-dimensional phononic crystals, and it is the approach we
use in the present work. The resulting constitutive material parameters, obtained
by this averaging scheme, together with the corresponding averaged ﬁeld equations,
will then by necessity produce the exact band structure of the original heterogeneous
crystal. They are functions of the wave frequency and wave vector, are unique, and
fully embody the refractive characteristics of the original composite. They may take
on positive or negative values depending on the frequency and the wave vector. Hence
the homogenized material may behave either as a normal composite or it may behave
as a so-called metamaterial. We also show how this structure can be controlled and
modiﬁed using anisotropic matrix materials and simple unit-cell geometries. We believe
our results and the proposed method of analysis are new and should provide powerful
tools for designing novel photonic or phononic crystals. Indeed, exploiting this, we show
for the ﬁrst time, that negative refraction with positive phase velocity refraction can
be realized and controlled on a wide frequency-range of the ﬁrst (lowest) pass band of
simple photonic and phononic crystals.

Luo et al.

(2002) have demonstrated negative refraction in a photonic crystal
consisting of circular holes placed in a square-lattice pattern within a homogeneous
and isotropic dielectric matrix. By interfacing the crystal with air along its (11)-
direction, they observed that negative refraction for TE waves can occur in a narrow
frequency (about 6.1%) at the far edges of the ﬁrst pass band. In the present paper, we
demonstrate a rich body of refractive characteristics that can be realized in photonic
and phononic crystal over a wide region of the ﬁrst pass band by suitably combining
the square geometric anisotropy with material anisotropy, suggesting that this can be
further enhanced by using a rectangular lattice structure.

An alternative method of homogenization is to consider a uniform reference medium
with assumed constant properties and then introduce and calculate the necessary
polarization strain-momentum or stress-velocity ﬁelds in the phononic case and

Sia Nemat-Nasser

polarization electric and magnetic ﬁelds in the photonic case such as to produce point-
wise the actual ﬁeld variables. For elastodynamic and electromagnetic homogenization
using this approach, Willis has developed general variational principles (Willis 1981a),
(Willis 1981b), (Willis 1984) (Milton & Willis 2007). The polarization approach has
also been used by (Amirkhizi & Nemat-Nasser 2008) to homogenize the electromagnetic
properties of periodic media (photonic crystals), and by the present author and
Srivastava (Nemat-Nasser & Srivastava 2011), (Srivastava & Nemat-Nasser 2012) to
homogenize phononic crystals; see also (Srivastava 2015) for comments.

There are other methods for calculating the eﬀective properties; see for example,
(Joannopoulos et al. 2011), (Antonakakis et al. 2013a), (Antonakakis et al. 2013b), (Yang
et al. 2014), (Antonakakis et al. 2014), (Yang et al. 2014), (Zhang & Wu 2015), and
references cited therein. Here we use the direct ﬁeld averaging for calculation of the
eﬀective properties that requires expressions of the periodic part of the ﬁeld variables.
The accurate calculation of these periodic parts for two- and three-dimensional
phononic/photonic crystals is a formidable task for unit cells consisting of constituents
of diverse properties with discontinuities. Naturally, the accuracy of the ﬁnal results,
whether obtained by direct calculation or through the corresponding eﬀective properties,
will depend on the accuracy of the estimate of the periodic part of the ﬁeld variables,
though both methods will yield exactly the same results.

There are only limited computational tools that can be employed, each with its
own limitations, (Leung & Liu 1990), (Bell et al. 1995), (Tran 1995), (Pendry 1996),
(Birks et al. 2006), (Hussein 2009), (Nemat-Nasser 2015b). In the present work, we use
a mixed variational formulation to calculate the band structure and the periodic part
of the ﬁeld variables (Nemat-Nasser 1972a). In this approach, both the displacement
and stress ﬁelds in the phononic and the electric and magnetic ﬁelds in the photonic
crystals are varied independently. Hence they may be approximated by any continuously
diﬀerentiable set of complete base functions, even though in actuality the gradients of
some of the ﬁeld variables may suﬀer large discontinuities across interfaces of various
constituents of a typical unit cell. Being based on a variational principle, any set
of approximating functions can be used for the calculations, e.g., plane-wave Fourier
series or ﬁnite elements (Nemat-Nasser et al. 1975), (Minagawa & Nemat-Nasser 1976),
(Minagawa et al. 1981). The mix variational approach produces very accurate results
and the rate of convergence of the corresponding series solution is superior to alternative
methods (Babuˇska & Osborn 1978). The general approach has been used to develop
a fast and accurate computational platform for band structure calculations (Lu &
Srivastava 2016), where it is shown that this approach provides a greater convergence
rate than the usual Rayleigh quotient, especially in the presence of large material
discontinuities; see also (Nemat-Nasser 2015a) and (Nemat-Nasser 2015b).

2. Statement of the Problem and Field Equations

Consider a doubly periodic composite composed of rectangular unit cells of common
dimensions a1 and a2. A typical unit cell, Ω1, includes a nested set of concentric
rectangular or elliptical (or their combination) shaped inclusions, Ωl, l = 2, 3, ..., n,
Ω1 ⊃ Ω2 ⊃ Ω3 ... ⊃ Ωn. For simplicity let the principal axes of the inclusions, a1(j) and
a2(j), be parallel to the coordinate axes, x1 and x2, although this is not necessary. In
what follows, we set a1 = a1(1) and a2 = a2(1).

We ﬁrst consider

the basic ﬁeld equations and establish the one-to-one
correspondence between anti-plane shear (SH) waves in phononic crystals and transverse
electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) electromagnetic (EM) waves in the photonic
crystals. Then we present a general method to produce the homogenized constitutive
parameters for the SH Bloch-waves by averaging the periodic part of the ﬁeld variables
and, based on the correspondence among the ﬁeld variables, we summarize the results
for the TE and TM, EM-waves. The calculation details are given in section (Appendix
A). In section (4) we work out three numerical examples and also show that the
homogenized eﬀective medium does indeed embody the exact band structure of the
original heterogeneous periodic composite, which clearly distinguishes it from any
anisotropic normal material. We also show that negative refraction can occur on the
ﬁrst (acoustic) pass band.

2.1. Basic Field Equations: SH Waves

The Bloch-form SH waves of frequency ω involve two shear stresses, τj(x1, x2), j = 1, 2,
and a lateral displacement, w(x1, x2), satisfying the following ﬁeld equations:

τj,j + ω2ρw = 0,

γj = w,j,

τj = µjkγk,

γj = Djkτk,

j, k = 1, 2.

(1)

Here ρ is the mass density, µjk = µkj and Djk = Dkj are the components of the shear and
compliance moduli, respectively, repeated indices are summed, and a comma followed by
an index denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to the corresponding coordinate variable.
When the principal axes of the elasticity tensor, µjk, are in the x1, x2-directions, then
µ12 = µ21 = 0. In what follows we consider the most general case where µ12 = µ21 (cid:54)= 0
and µ11 (cid:54)= µ22, and show by means of illustrative examples how the resulting band
structure is aﬀected by these factors.

2.2. Basic Field Equations: TE/TM Waves

Consider now the basic equations for EM waves and denote by Ej, Hj, Bj, and Dj,
j = 1, 2, 3, the components of electric, magnetic, magnetic induction, and electric
displacement ﬁelds, respectively. Here we focus on TE and TM electromagnetic waves,
set E3 = H1 = H2 = 0 and H3 = H for TE waves, and H3 = E1 = E2 = 0 and E3 = E
for TM waves, reducing the general Maxwell equations,

∇ × E − iωB = 0, ∇ × H + iωD = 0,

(2)

Sia Nemat-Nasser

∇. B = ∇. D = 0, Dj = jkEk, Bj = µjkHk,

to the following set of scalar equations, for TE and TM waves, respectively:

E1,2 − E2,1 + iωµH = 0,
H,2 + iω(11E1 + 12E2) = 0,
H,1 − iω(21E1 + 22E2) = 0
−H1,2 + H2,1 + iωE = 0,
E,2 − iω(µ11H1 + µ12H2) = 0,
E,1 + iω(µ21H1 + µ22H2) = 0 .

,

(3)

(4)

(5)

In equations (4), µ = µ33 is the magnetic permeability and jk = kj are the components
of the electric permittivity, and in equations (5),  = 33 is the electric permittivity and
µjk = µkj are the components of the magnetic permeability, respectively. All the ﬁeld
variables are functions of x1, x2 only since the time variable is incorporated into the ﬁeld
equations. When the principal axes of the material parameters are, respectively, in the
x1, x2-directions, then 12 = 21 = 0 and µ12 = µ21 = 0. Here again we do not assume
this and consider the most general anisotropic case.

2.3. Correspondence between SH and TE/TM Waves

The ﬁeld equations (4) reduce to ﬁeld equations (1) if we set,

E1 = τ2,

E2 = −τ1, H = −iωw, µ = ρ,

jk = Djk.

Similarly, the ﬁeld equations (5) reduce to ﬁeld equations (1) if we set,

H1 = −τ2, H2 = τ1,

E = −iωw,

 = ρ, µjk = Djk.

(6)

(7)

Therefore, it is suﬃcient to outline the homogenization procedures for the SH stress
waves and then extract the corresponding homogenized results for TE and TM waves
by direct association based on equations (6) and (7).

To this end we average the periodic parts of the ﬁeld equations as well as the
periodic parts of the constitutive equations over a typical unit cell of the composite. In
this manner the eﬀective parameters are obtained independently of the conservation
equations.
Substitution of the resulting eﬀective parameters into the averaged
conservation relations should then yield the exact band structure in each case. The
method in universal and can be used in two- and three-dimensional cases with impunity.

3. Homogenization

We now seek to extract the overall dynamic eﬀective material parameters of the
composite such that they produce the exact frequency band structure of the composite.

3.1. Homogenized Eﬀective Parameters: SH Waves

For Bloch-form time-harmonic SH waves of frequency ω, traveling in a doubly periodic
phononic crystal, the time-dependence of the ﬁeld variables is incorporated into
equations(1). These ﬁeld variables have the following structure:

 w

(8)

where superimposed p denotes the periodic part, and k1 and k2 are the components of
the wave vector.

3.1.1. Average Eﬀective Constitutive Parameters: We directly average the periodic
parts of equations (8) over a typical unit cell and set,

where a typical averaged ﬁeld variable, say ¯G, is deﬁned as

(9)

¯G = ¯Gpei(k1x1+k2x2),

¯Gp =

Gp(x1, x2)dx1x2.

(10)

We now deﬁne the eﬀective compliance and stiﬀness tensors, Def f
eﬀective mass density, ρef f , by

jk and µef f

(Djkτ p

(ρwp) = ρef f ¯wp,

(11)

where the quantities (Djkτ p
k ) and ρwp are calculated by direct averaging over the unit
cell. Using the averaged ﬁeld quantities, (11), the ﬁeld equations (1) are now averaged
(see Appendix B for details) to obtain,

ik1¯τ1 + ik2¯τ2 + ω2ρef f ¯w = 0,
jk ¯τk = 0, ¯τj − µef f
¯γj − Def f

jk ¯γk = 0,

[µef f

ikj ¯w − ¯γj = 0,

(12)

The band structure is obtained from equations (12) by substituting (12)2,3,4 into (12)1,
arriving at,

ω2 =

ρef f kjµef f

jl kl,

j, l = 1, 2 f or SH, stress waves,

(13)

where the repeated indices are summed. Note that the eﬀective compliance tensor, Def f
jk ,
and hence the corresponding stiﬀness tensor, µef f
jk , as well as the eﬀective mass density,
ρef f , are calculated directly once the periodic parts of the stress and displacement
ﬁelds are known. Although these ﬁelds are calculated independently using a mixed
variational method, as discussed in Appendix A, they are the actual ﬁeld quantities

Sia Nemat-Nasser

that correspond to the exact associated frequency band. Therefore they should, by
necessity, produce the correct band structure.
It is however important to note that
the equation of motion, (12)1, is not, and should not be used to obtain the eﬀective
constitutive parameters. These eﬀective parameters should characterize the considered
particular material (here a linearly elastic one), independently of the conservation laws
(here the linear momentum). The author has used a similar direct averaging technique
to calculate the eﬀective properties of phononic crystals in plane strain and plane stress
cases where there are two coupled conservation equations. The procedure does indeed
yield the exact band structure and the resulting eﬀective compliance components do
automatically satisfy the stress compatibility equation.

3.2. Homogenized Eﬀective Parameters: TE/TM Waves

Now consider equations (4,5), and following similar steps as before, obtain the

following homogenized TE and TM wave equations, respectively:

To express the band structure of the photonic crystal in terms of the corresponding

(21)

For numerical examples, we ﬁrst calculate the ﬁeld variables associated with each
frequency band, and then, follow the procedure outlined above, appropriately average
over a unit cell to obtain the eﬀective parameters.

4. Illustrative Examples

We consider a simple two-phase photonic crystal that consists of a homogeneous
anisotropic dielectric matrix containing 1.5mm holes, periodically spaced 4mm apart
in both the x1- and x2-directions. Using thermoplastic co-extrusion fabrication or
other methods, low-loss dielectric composites of various degrees of anisotropy can be
fabricated; see, e.g., (Zhang et al. 2008), (Wing et al. 2006). Here, for illustration, we
use a matrix with dielectric constants of M
II = 90, where the superimposed
M denotes the matrix dielectric tensor.

I = 9.6 and M

To examine the eﬀect of the microstructure of the unit cell on the response of the
resulting medium, we consider two cases that diﬀer from one another only by a diﬀerent
arrangement of the principal axes of the matrix dielectric tensors relative to the x1, x2-
coordinate directions, i.e., in relation to the periodicity of the original composite. These
cases are:

Case A: The principal axes of M
Case B : The principal axes of M

jk coincide with the x1, x2-axes;
jk make a 15o angle with the x1, x2-axes.

We then show how the refractive behavior of the composite has been dramatically
changed by this simple rearrangement. Indeed, we show, for the ﬁrst time, that even
on the ﬁrst (lowest) pass band of the medium, one can realize negative refraction over a
broad range of frequencies and phase angles. In addition, we show that the frequencies at
which such response occurs can be lowered by surrounding the central hole with 0.5mm
thick high-dielectric material; such high dielectric solids can be produced by various
means, see, e.g., (Sengupta & Sengupta 1999), (Si et al. 2002).

In addition to the above two- and three-phase photonic composites, we also consider
a very simple phononic crystal to illustrate our general results and show that negative
energy refraction with positive phase-velocity refraction can be realized on the ﬁrst
(lowest) pass band. The constituent properties of the phononic crystal are chosen
to have large variations within the unit cell to also show the eﬀectiveness of the
variational approach. These examples show the rich body of physics that can be revealed
by the present approach as well as the versatility and eﬀectiveness of the proposed
computational tool; see also (Nemat-Nasser 2015b).

Figures (1) show the unit cells of the two photonic crystals that are examined below. The
arrows on the upper left corner of each unit cell indicate the directions of the principal

jk make a 15o angle
with the x1, x2-axes.

In Figure (1a) these principal
axes of the dielectric tensor of the matrix material.
axes coincide with the x1, x2-axes, whereas in Figure (1b) they are at a 15o angle with
respect to the x1, x2-axes. The normalized wave-vector components are Q1 = a1k1 and
Q2 = a2k2; note that a1 = a2 = 4mm in the present case.

The matrix electric constants in Figure (1a) are:

• M
11 = 9.6;
• M
22 = 90;
• M
12 = M
• µM = 1.

12 = 0;

The dielectric tensor for Figure (1b), with the same principal values as in Figure (1a),
has the following components with respect to the x1, x2-coordinates:

• M
• M
• M

11 = 15;
22 = 84.6;
12 = M
with µM = 1.

12 = 20.1,

The ﬁrst 10 pass bands corresponding to these unit cells are shown in Figures 2
for Q2 = 1.07. In these ﬁgures, the solid lines are obtained by direct band structure
calculation using equation (A.10)1 whereas the open circles are by using the eﬀective
parameters; equation (20). As can be seen, the eﬀective parameters yield the exact band
structure in each case. In what follows, the eﬀective parameters are used for all related
calculations.

(b): they are at about 15o angle with respect to the x1, x2-axes; two-phase photonic
crystal of unit cells shown in Figures (1a,b).

In Figures (3) we have shown the equi-frequency contours of the ﬁrst three pass
bands of these photonic crystals, calculated using the homogenized parameters. Identical
results are obtained from the direct calculations.

The graphs in the left column in Figures 3 are for the case when the principal axes
of the electric permittivity tensor of the matrix material coincide with the geometric
symmetry axes of the periodic composite, and those on the right are for the case when
the electric permittivity and the geometric principal axes are at about 15o angle relative
to one another.

The energy-ﬂux vectors are also shown for these pass bands in Figures 3. As is
well-known, the group velocity vector, vg
j , and the energy-ﬂux (Poynting) vector are
coincident for the present class of problems, both pointing in the direction of energy
ﬂow. On each frequency band, J, the phase, vp
Jj, velocities are given by,

here, J = 1, 2, ... denotes the frequency band and j = 1, 2. At each point on a frequency
contour in Figures (3), one can readily identify the direction of the energy ﬂow and the
corresponding direction of the phase velocity.

As is seen, when the principal axes of the matrix dielectric tensor coincide with the
x1, x2-axes, we see on the ﬁrst pass band the group velocity vectors pointing outwards
on the ﬁrst quadrant, indicating positive refraction for both the phase velocity and the
group velocity (energy ﬂux).

Here however, for the ﬁrst time, without introducing a loaded series of capacitance
and inductance (Siddiqui et al. 2003), we have realized negative energy refraction with
positive phase-velocity refraction on a wide region of the ﬁrst (lowest) frequency pass
band of a photonic crystal of very simple unit cell: an anisotropic matrix with a central
hole.
In the past, negative refraction has been reported on the second pass band of
periodic composites, similar to what is seen on the second band in the left column graphs
of Figures (3). Here, even the second pass band in the right column graphs of Figures (3)
embodies a rich variety of refractive characteristics, including positive refraction over a
broad range of frequencies. These new results are better seen in Figures (4) on the ﬁrst
(left) and second (right) pass bands of the unit cell in Figure (1b) for the normalized
wave vector in the range 0 < Q1, Q2 < π.

4.2. Three-phase Composite

The computational tool presented in this paper allows to eﬃciently and accurately design
unit cell for any desired refractive objectives. The available variables are the geometry
of the unit cell, its composition, and in the present case the orientation of the principal
axes of the matrix relative to the geometric symmetry of the unit cell. To illustrate this
possibility, we modifying the above-considered unit cell by encasing the central circular
hole with a 0.5mm material of high dielectric constant, say, 11 = 22 = 150, keeping all
other parameters the same. Dielectric solids with very high dielectric constant have been
fabricated; see, e.g., (Sengupta & Sengupta 1999), (Si et al. 2002). The corresponding
unit cell and a portion of the ﬁrst pass band are shown in Figures (5) for 0 < Q1, Q2 < π.
As is seen the frequencies are reduced by about 20%.

electric permittivity tensor of the matrix (Left, heavy arrows) are at about 15o angle
with respect to the x1, x2-coordinate axes.

4.3. Unit-cell Properties for Phononic Crystal; SH-waves

We consider a simple two-phase phononic crystal with the unit cell shown in Figure
(6a). It consists of a unidirectionally reinforced carbon ﬁber-epoxy composite matrix
containing 2mm-diameter circular aluminum-inclusions that are spaced 5mm center-to-
center in the x1 and x2-directions such that the principal directions of the matrix stiﬀness
tensor make a 30o angle with the x1, x2-axis, as shown by the arrows in Figure (6a). The
principal values of the shear modulus tensor are measured at 500kHz to be µM
I = 2.4GP a
and µM
II = 5.8GP a. The corresponding components in the x1, x2-coordinates, and the
properties of the aluminum inclusions are,

22 =28GPa; ρIn=2700kg/m3.

22=4.95GPa; µM

12=1.47GPa; ρM =1440kg/m3.

The ﬁrst ten pass bands of this crystal are shown in Figure (6b) for Q2 = 1.06, and
in Figure (7) we have shown the equi-frequency contours of the ﬁrst four pass bands.
The arrows in the contour maps are the corresponding energy-ﬂux vectors.

As is evident from the energy-ﬂux directions over the ﬁrst (lowest) frequency pass
band in Figure (7), negative refraction occurs with positive phase-velocity refraction
over a wide range of positive phase angles.
Indeed by simply suitably arranging the
axes of the matrix anisotropy relative to the x1, x2-axes, a remarkably rich body of
refraction characteristics of the composite is realized. We believe these results and our
proposed method of analysis are new, and should provide powerful tools for designing
novel phononic crystals. In Figures (8) we have captured the refraction response of this
simple phononic crystal for the indicated values of the wave-vector components over

the ﬁrst two (lowest two) pass bands where the phase velocity is positive. Positive or
negative energy refraction is captured at various frequencies.

5. Discussion and Conclusions

We have shown, for the ﬁrst time, that negative refraction with positive phase velocity
refraction can be realized over a broad range of frequencies on the ﬁrst (lowest) frequency
pass band of very simple photonic and phononic crystals, and that this can be controlled
by suitable unit-cell design.

First we have provided a uniﬁed methodology to accurately and eﬃciently produce
the homogenized eﬀective material properties of doubly periodic phononic crystals for
anti-plane shear (SH) and photonic crystals for transverse electric (TE) and transverse
magnetic (TM) electromagnetic Bloch-form waves over any desired range of frequencies.
We have shown the correspondence between phononic and photonic ﬁeld equations, and
have outlined in detail the actual calculation procedures. We have worked out illustrative
examples for each case and have unveiled a rich body of refractive characteristics of these
crystals that have thus far been hidden.

It turns out that both photonic and phononic crystals with even the simplest unit

Sia Nemat-Nasser

cells have a rich body of refractive responses that can be realized even on the ﬁrst
(lowest) frequency pass band. Indeed, on the ﬁrst and second frequency pass bands, one
can have: (a) negative refraction with negative phase-velocity refraction, (b) negative
refraction with positive phase-velocity refraction, (c) positive refraction with negative
phase-velocity refraction, (d) positive refraction with positive phase-velocity refraction,
or even (e) complete reﬂection with no energy transmission, depending on the frequency
and wave vector.

Our calculation method applies to any unit cell that may consist of anisotropic
constituents of any constant or variable properties that may also admit large
discontinuities. The homogenized (spatially constant) eﬀective material parameters
depend parametrically on the wave frequency and wave vector. They embody the
actual dispersive properties of the considered phononic/photonic crystal, and produce
their exact band structure. Using the same volume fraction of the same constituents,

(6a) for indicated values of the wave-vector components over the ﬁrst two (lowest two)
pass bands where the phase velocity is positive; arrows are the energy-ﬂux vectors.

one can design a (homogenized) material that would display negative energy refraction
with positive phase velocity refraction even on its ﬁrst (acoustic) pass band, providing
opportunity for a variety of applications where devices with low loss refractive properties
are required. The window of frequency and the range of wave-vector values at which
the negative energy refraction would occur can be controlled by judicious selection and
design of the unit cell’s constituent geometry and properties.

Appendix A. Band Structure Calculation

The calculation of the band structure and the associated ﬁeld variables for two-
and three-dimensional phononic/photonic crystals presents a formidable challenge
especially when their unit cells consist of constituents of diverse properties with large
discontinuities. There are limited computational tools that can be employed, each with
its own limitations, see for example the following and cited references therein: (Leung
& Liu 1990), (Plihal & Maradudin 1991), (Kushwaha et al. 1993), (Pendry 1994), (Bell
et al. 1995), (Tran 1995), (Pendry 1996), (Chou & Lin 2014), (Han & Chang 2014). In
the present work, we use a mixed variational formulation for band-structure calculations,
where both the displacement and stress ﬁelds in the phononic and the electric and
magnetic ﬁelds in the photonic crystals are varied independently. Hence they may
be approximated by any continuously diﬀerentiable set of complete base functions, even
though the gradients of some of the ﬁeld variables may suﬀer large discontinuities across

Sia Nemat-Nasser

17

interfaces of various constituents of a typical unit cell. Since the method is based on a
variational principle, any set of approximating functions can be used for calculations,
e.g., plane-wave Fourier series or ﬁnite elements (Nemat-Nasser et al. 1975), (Minagawa
& Nemat-Nasser 1976), (Minagawa et al. 1981). The mixed variational produces very
accurate results and the rate of convergence of the corresponding series solution is
superior to alternative methods (Babuˇska & Osborn 1978). The general approach has
been used to develop a fast and accurate computational platform for band structure
calculations (Lu & Srivastava 2016), where it is also shown that the mixed variational
approach provides greater convergence rate than the usual Rayleigh quotient, especially
in the presence of large material discontinuities. Other variational methods have also
been used for band structure calculation of periodic composites, see, e.g., (Goﬀaux &
S´anchez-Dehesa 2003).

In what follows, detailed calculations are given for the SH waves and then the

results for TE and TM waves are extracted using the corresponding equations.

Appendix A.1. SH Waves

We minimize the following functional, considering the displacement and stresses as
independent ﬁelds subject to variation:

The functional (A.1) was introduced by the present author in the early 1970’s
(Nemat-Nasser (1972b)) and was termed new quotient. It yields remarkably accurate
frequency bands of phononic crystals using only a few plane-wave approximations as
compared with the usual Rayleigh quotient (Nemat-Nasser 2015b). Here we use the
following approximating functions:

Appendix A.3. Expressions for Λf (x1,x2) in Special Cases

When a rectangular unit cell contains a nested sequence of either rectangular or elliptical
inclusions, matrix Λf (x1,x2) can be calculated explicitly for piecewise constant values of
f (x1, x2). Consider an a1 by a2 unit cell, Ω1, that contains a nested sequence of n − 1
concentric either elliptical or rectangular subregions, Ω1 ⊃ Ω2 ⊃ Ω3 ... ⊃ Ωn.
Denote the dimensions of the principal axes of a typical subregion Ωj by a1(j) and
a2(j). Then the area of the jth subregion is Ωj − Ωj−1, where for a rectangular subregion
Ωj = a1(j)a2(j), and for an elliptical subregion Ωj = π
4 a1(j)a2(j). Let f (j) stand for
either the mass-density or the shear modulus of the subregion Ωj − Ωj−1. From (A.4)
now obtain,

The periodic part of the ﬁeld variables is directly averaged to obtain the corresponding
eﬀective parameters according to equations (11) for SH waves and equations (18) and
(19) for TE and TM. Here we give the equations for the calculation of the eﬀective

Here we present the details of the averaging procedure. Consider the dynamic ﬁeld
equations (1) and, for notational simplicity,
introduce the two-dimensional vectors,
k, x, X,and y with the respective components, kj, xj, Xj, and yj. Now multiply (1)1,2,3
by e−ik.X and write the resulting equations as,

set y = x − X and obtain,

(cid:0)τ p
