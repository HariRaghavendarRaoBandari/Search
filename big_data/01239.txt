We use an su(2) version of the extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model to describe nucleonic matter
and the usual su(3) version of the NJL model with vector interaction to describe quark matter. We
calculate the nuclear pasta phases that appear in the inner crust of neutron stars within the su(2)
extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with diﬀerent parametrizations. We consider two methods
for the non-homogeneous phases: the coexistence-phases approximation and the compressible liquid
drop model, and we calculate the surface tension coeﬃcient using a geometrical approach at zero
temperature. The energy density and pressure are determined in the region of densities and proton
fractions where the pasta shapes are expected to appear. The equation of state of stellar matter is
calculated, and the mass-radius relation for several families of hadronic and hybrid stars determined.
The quark phase of hybrid stars is described within the su(3) NJL model including a vector term.
Masses above 2M⊙ have been obtained for hadronic stars.

INTRODUCTION

Neutron stars still remain today, despite several stud-
ies started many years ago, either from an observational
point of view, or from a theoretical point of view, a big
question mark, with respect to their constitution and
characteristics. Currently, many eﬀorts are being made
to try to unravel a bit further our knowledge on this
exotic objects, the remnants of core-collapse supernova
events (see e.g. the forthcoming volume of EPJA Topi-
cal Issue on “Exotic Matter in Neutron Stars” [1]).

In the inner crust of neutron stars, at sub-saturation
densities, a frustrated system, named nuclear pasta, ap-
pears due to the competition between the Coulomb and
the strong forces. These exotic structures have their ge-
ometry changing as the density increases. One of the
main interests on these nuclear shapes are the eﬀect that
they might have on the neutrino transport [2–5], and
subsequent cooling of the neutron star. Recent studies
[6] have shown evidence on the existence of the pasta
phases, where these structures limit the maximum spin
period of isolated X-ray pulsars.

The nuclear pasta phase has been studied under diﬀer-
ent assumptions, namely using semi-classical microscopic
treatments, like quantum molecular dynamic calculations
[3, 7], or using microscopic calculations, like 1D Hartree-
Fock [8, 9], or 3D Hartree-Fock using SLy4 Skyrme model
[10]. Relativistic mean-ﬁeld (RMF) calculations employ-
ing a model for the Lagrangian, which is based on micro-
scopic Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock calculations, using
realistic NN interactions [11], or using the Thomas-Fermi
calculations, based on phenomenological energy-density
functionals [12] are also widely used. RMF models do
not consider explicit chiral invariance.
In this article,
we use a diﬀerent set of models for the description of
the nucleonic homogeneous matter and the pasta phase:
the extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with diﬀerent

parametrizations [13–19], where the chiral symmetry is
included. An advantage of these models is the fact that,
since they satisfy chiral symmetry, the EoS is also valid
at higher densities, as the ones present in the center of
compact objects.

As discussed in [16], a link between QCD and the de-
scription of nuclear matter and nuclei through eﬀective
hadronic ﬁelds can be established including QCD sym-
metries in the Lagrangian density of the system. Us-
ing the extended NJL (eNJL) model developed in the
present study, we include chiral symmetry, together with
the mechanism of mass generation and binding of nuclear
matter, the chiral condensates being built from nucleonic
degrees of freedom.

The pasta phase calculation (see e.g.

[20] and refer-
ences therein) is done by considering two diﬀerent meth-
ods: the coexisting-phases (CP) approximation, where
the Gibbs equilibrium conditions are used to get the low-
est free-energy state, and the surface and Coulomb terms
are added “by hand”, and the compressible liquid drop
(CLD) model, where, unlike the CP approximation, both
the Coulomb and surface terms are taken into account in
the minimization of the total energy of the system.

In the present paper, our aim is the complete descrip-
tion of possible matters in the interior of neutron stars.
Once matter at subsaturation and suprasaturation densi-
ties are obtained and understood within the su(2) eNJL,
we consider also the su(3) version of the NJL model [21–
25] with a vector interaction [26–29] to describe a possi-
ble neutron star core in a hybrid star. We construct the
complete stellar EoS by considering the BPS EoS [30]
for the outer crust, the pasta EoS for the inner crust,
and investigate two diﬀerent scenarios at high densities:
i) nucleonic matter and ii) nucleonic and quark matter
via Maxwell construction. In the second case, we inves-
tigate the possibility of a hybrid star with a quark core.
Whenever stellar matter is considered, either in the pasta

phase or in its center, β−equilibrium and charge neutral-
ity are enforced. The procedure just described allows us
to obtain the inner crust and the core stellar matter EoS,
within the same framework.

The paper is organized as follows: the formalism is
brieﬂy reviewed in Sec. II that is divided in diﬀerent sub-
sections. We ﬁrst analyze homogeneous nucleonic mat-
ter and its saturation properties obtained with the su(2)
eNJL model and then brieﬂy outline the main aspects of
the construction of the pasta phase, including the surface
tension calculation. The su(3) NJLv model is then intro-
duced for the description of quark matter, and for the
calculation of the hybrid star mass and radius. Section
III is devoted to the presentation and discussion of the
results, while the main conclusions are given in Sec. IV.

A.

eNJL model

The nucleonic NJL model can be extended to yield
reasonable saturation properties of nuclear matter, the
ﬁeld ψ being the nucleon ﬁeld [13–15, 17–19]. An ef-
fective density dependent coupling constant is obtained
if the following extended NJL (eNJL) Lagrangian den-
sity, which actually pushes chiral symmetry restoration
to higher densities, is considered:

L = ¯ψ(iγµ∂µ − m)ψ + Gs[( ¯ψψ)2 + ( ¯ψiγ5~τ ψ)2]

− Gv( ¯ψγµψ)2 − Gsv[( ¯ψψ)2 + ( ¯ψiγ5~τ ψ)2]( ¯ψγµψ)2

(1)

− Gρ(cid:2)( ¯ψγµ~τ ψ)2 + ( ¯ψγ5γµ~τ ψ)2(cid:3)
− Gvρ( ¯ψγµψ)2(cid:2)( ¯ψγµ~τ ψ)2 + ( ¯ψγ5γµ~τ ψ)2(cid:3)
− Gsρ(cid:2)( ¯ψψ)2 + ( ¯ψiγ5~τ ψ)2(cid:3)(cid:2)( ¯ψγµ~τ ψ)2 + ( ¯ψγ5γµ~τ ψ)2(cid:3) .

For nuclear matter, the degeneracy is ν = 2Nf , and Λ is
such that M = 939 MeV is the nucleon mass in the vac-
uum, determined variationally. The term in Gv simulates
a chiral invariant short range repulsion between nucleons.
The term in Gsv accounts for the density dependence of
the scalar coupling. For nuclear matter, the NJL model
leads to binding, but the binding energy per particle does
not have a minimum except at a rather high density
where the nucleon mass is small or vanishing. The intro-
duction of the Gsv coupling term is required to correct
this. The isovector-vector term (the Gρ term) allows the
description of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter. A cur-
rent mass m term that breaks explicitly the chiral sym-
metry is introduced in some parametrizations to make
the restoration of the chiral symmetry less abrupt. The
terms Gωρ and Gsρ make the symmetry energy softer.

using in this study, eNJLx, eNJLxωρy and eNJLJxσρy
(without current mass), and eNJLxm and eNJLxmσρy

i.e., Gvρ 6= 0 (Gsρ 6= 0). We have ﬁxed the symmetry en-

JLx (eNJLxm), and we calculated the new Gρ constants,
by ﬁxing the Gvρ (Gsρ) coupling constant.

where f is the volume fraction of phase I.

of the system are derived from the minimization of the
total free energy [33], including the surface and Coulomb
terms. The equilibrium conditions for a ﬁxed proton frac-

B. The coexisting-phases approximation and the

compressible liquid drop model

In order to describe the nonuniform npe matter in-
side the Wigner-Seitz unit cell, which is taken to be a
sphere (bubble), a cylinder (tube), or a slab, in three,
two, and one dimensions, we use two diﬀerent methods:
the coexistence-phases (CP) approximation and the com-
pressible liquid drop (CLD) model. In the CP approx-
imation, matter is organized into separated regions of
higher and lower density; the higher ones being the pasta
phases, and the lower ones being a background nucleon
gas. The interface between these regions is sharp and
ﬁnite-size eﬀects are taken into account by surface and
Coulomb terms in the energy density [31]. The Gibbs
equilibrium conditions are imposed to get the lowest-
energy state and, for a temperature T = T I = T II and

C. The surface tension

We use a geometrical approach to obtain a numerical
value for the surface tension coeﬃcient. This method was

introduced and discussed in [36] for quark matter. The
surface tension coeﬃcient, σ, is given by

σ =

, εg = ε(ρ1)+ε(ρ2)

with ρg = ρ1+ρ2
, and ∆ε the diﬀer-
ence between the energy density of homogeneous matter
and the non-uniform matter, given by ∆ε = εhm − εnhm.
These energy densities were ﬁtted to a functional form
given by ε = b0 + b1ρ + b2ρ2. ρ1 and ρ2 are the two
coexistence points. In Figure 1, we show the energy per
baryon and the energy density as a function of the den-
sity for the homogeneous and non-homogeneous cases.
The surface tension, σ, which measures the energy per
unit area necessary to create a planar interface between
the two phases, is deﬁned in terms of the EoS, as in
[36]. The width of the interface region and magnitude
of σ are controlled by the adjustable parameter a. Here
a was chosen to be 0.1 so that it reproduces the sur-
face tension coeﬃcient for the NL3 model [37] within a
Thomas-Fermi calculation [38], for a ﬁxed proton fraction
of yp = 0.5. We also tested for a diﬀerent RMF model,
the TW model [39], and we obtained a similar result,
a = 0.13, for a ﬁxed proton fraction of 0.5. Since this
parameter a depends on the isospin, we calculated it for
several values of the proton fraction, and then we ﬁtted
it to a functional a = a1 + a2x2 + a3x4 + a4x6, in order to
calculate the pasta phase in β−equilibrium matter. We
have obtained a1 = −0.00391407, a2 = 0.251366, a3 =
5.5648, a4 = −18.5799, taking NL3 as reference.

D. NJL model

The su(3) NJL model [21–26] is given by the following

Lagrangian density

L = Lf + Ll + Lsym + Lvec + Ldet

(12)

with

Lf = ¯ψf (iγµ∂µ − mf )ψf , Ll = ¯ψl(iγµ∂µ − ml)ψl ,

Here ψf is the 3-ﬂavor quark ﬁeld. The eﬀective mass,

Mi, is given by

Mi = mi − 4Gsρsi − 2Gtρsj ρsk ,

with (i, j, k) being any permutation of (u, d, s), and the

We are using four diﬀerent parametrizations for the

MeV−2, the t’Hooft interaction constant, Gt = −9.4/Λ5
MeV−5, and the cut-oﬀ parameter, Λ = 631.4 MeV,
are equal for all the four parametrizations. The diﬀer-
ence is in the coupling for the vector interaction, Gv,
that is given as Gv = xGs, x = 0, 0.05, 0.2, 0.5. We
will be calling our set of models NJLi, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, for
x = 0, 0.05, 0.2, 0.5, respectively.

We consider diﬀerent EoS for the construction of a hy-
brid star: a hadronic EoS, where we use the parameter
sets presented in Tables I and II, and a quark EoS, where
we consider the NJLi models presented in the ﬁrst sec-
tion, and we perform a Maxwell construction. This con-
struction says that two phases are in equilibrium when
their chemical potentials, temperatures and pressures are

Finding the pressure at the transition, Pt, will then give
us a range of densities with a mixed phase.

With the complete EoS, we integrate the TOV [40, 41]
equations and ﬁnd the mass-radius relation for the fam-
ily of stars. This is a simpliﬁed approach to the descrip-
tion of the deconﬁnement phase transition, but it has
been shown that if the surface tension of a quark droplet
immersed in nuclear matter is high enough, the results
obtained are quite realistic [42].

III. RESULTS

In the present section we use the model presented in
the previous sections to describe stellar dense matter as
found in neutron stars. In particular, we present a uni-
ﬁed EoS, except for the outer crust, which is, however,
essentially constrained by observational data. We ﬁx the
parameters of the model constrained by the properties
of nuclear matter at saturation. Properties of symmet-
ric matter and pure neutron matter are discussed.
It
has been shown that in order to get consistently the ra-
dius of stars with masses M . 1.5M⊙, it is important

to describe the inner crust in an appropriate way. We,
therefore, calculate the inner crust EoS and discuss how
the properties of the EoS aﬀect the structure of the pasta
phases. Finally, we build the EoS of β-equilibrium mat-
ter and integrate the TOV equations in order to get the
mass versus radius curves. We consider both nucleonic
stars and hybrid stars. The EoS for hybrid stars takes
into account a possible deconﬁnement phase transition
to quark matter. Quark matter is described within the
su(3) NJLi, discussed above, taking into account the pos-
sibility of the strangeness onset.

A. Equation of state for symmetric matter

We consider the parametrizations eNJL1, eNJL2,
eNJL3 and eNJL1m and eNJL2m, as referred before,
with their parametrizations given in Table I and their
properties for symmetric nuclear matter in Table II. For
eNJL1, eNJL2, and eNJL3, the symmetry energy prop-
erties at saturation are very similar, but their isoscalar
properties diﬀer slightly, eNJL2 having a smaller incom-
pressibility. Their values are, however, all within the in-
terval proposed in [43], K = 230±40 MeV. Another prop-
erty that distinguishes these three models is the density
of chiral symmetry restoration, respectively, 0.35, 0.45,
and 0.998 fm−3, for eNJL1, eNJL2, and eNJL3, see Fig.
2, bottom right panel. As we see next, this allows the

construction of EoS for hadronic matter with diﬀerent
behaviors at intermediate and high densities.

In Fig. 2, the energy per particle, and pressure (left
panels), and the incompressibility and eﬀective mass
(right panels) of symmetric nuclear matter are plotted
as a function of density. The main feature of these EoS
is the change that occurs at the chiral symmetry restora-
tion density, ρχ: the EoS becomes much stiﬀer after the
transition, which, for eNJL3, only happens at ρ ∼ 7ρ0.
Just before the transition, there is a softening clearly seen
in the incompressibility, K, followed by a change of the
slope of the pressure, and a discontinuity of the incom-
pressibility. The models with current mass do not present
this feature. With a proper choice of the parameters, the
chiral symmetry restoration takes place at higher densi-
ties, and the EoS becomes much softer at intermediate
densities. As we will see later, the stiﬀening of the EoS
will allow for very massive stars.

eNJLx and eNJLxm have a quite large slope of the
symmetry energy at saturation density, larger than lab-
oratory constraints seem to impose [44]. We, there-
fore, built six other parametrizations with a smaller
slope, L, by including in the Lagrangian density a
mixed vector-isoscalar - vector-isovector (scalar-isoscalar
- vector-isovector) eight point term. These parametriza-
tions are designated by eNJLxωρy (eNJLx(m)σρy). The
symmetry energy and its slope at saturation density of
all these models are shown as a function of the density

in Fig.3. While below ρχ, the eNJL1, eNJL2, and eNJL3
models behave as relativistic mean ﬁeld (RMF) models,
see [45, 46], above this density, the symmetry energy be-
comes much softer and its slope may even become imme-
diately negative. This occurs for all models with the mix
vector-isoscalar - vector-isovector term. The symmetry
energy will eventually become negative at some density
above ρχ, indicating an instability and a tendency for
stellar matter to become pure neutron matter.
If the
restoration of chiral symmetry occurs at a density not
high enough, the model becomes inadequate to describe
stellar matter. In the last subsection, only models which
do not predict a neutron instability will be used to de-
scribe stellar matter.

The models with current mass (right panels) do not
show such an abrupt behavior as they have a softer
restoration of the chiral symmetry. For these models,
we also consider a term that couples the chiral conden-
sate and the isospin density, to make the symmetry en-
ergy less hard, allowing the parametrizations to satisfy
constraints from microscopic calculations based on chi-
ral NN and 3N interactions [47] and Quantum Monte
Carlo results [48]. At the same time, we avoid that the
symmetry energy becomes negative below a reasonably
high density. This behavior is possible by including a
coupling of the isovector-vector term to a isoscalar-scalar
term, and not to a isoscalar-vector term, because at high
densities the chiral condensate weakens.

FIG. 4. (Color online) Pressure as a function of the density for symmetric nuclear matter and for all the models considered
in this study. The red region represents the experimental results from Danielewicz et al and the green region from the Kaons
experiment. In the right panel, a Maxwell construction for the eNJL1 and eNJL2 models is also shown.

In Fig. 4, we compare the symmetric nuclear matter
pressure to experimental results obtained from collective
ﬂow data in heavy-ion collisions [49] and from the KaoS
experiment [50–53]. The left panel only contains nucle-
onic EoS. All EoS shown in this panel satisfy the con-
straints imposed by the KaoS experiment, which refer to
densities from above the saturation density to twice the
saturation density. The models eNJL2 and e NJL3 are
also compatible with constraints from HIC ﬂow experi-
ments. The eNJL1 model, however, becomes quite hard
above 2.5 ρ0, even considering that the constraints im-
posed in [49] are too stringent, since the data analysis
contains some model dependence.

We have allowed for a possible deconﬁnement phase
transition in models eNJL1 and eNJL2. The symmetric
matter EoS obtained within a Maxwell construction are
plotted in the right panel of Fig. 4. We observe that, for
both models, the deconﬁnement phase transition occurs
above the range of densities constrained by the ﬂow data,
and, therefore, the conclusions are similar to the ones
derived from the left panel. However, for densities above
4ρ0, deconﬁnement gives rise to a clear softening of the
EoS. For comparison, we replot in the right panel the
EoS of models eNJL1m, eNJL2m and eNJL3.

We next compare the behavior of neutron matter, cal-
culated with the models under study, with microscopic
calculations. In Fig. 5, we show the pressure as a func-
tion of the density for pure neutron matter obtained
with the eNJLx, eNJLxωρy and the eNJLxmσρ mod-
els. The two colored bands in the ﬁgure are the results
from microscopic calculations based on chiral NN and 3N
interactions (green) [47] and Quantum Monte Carlo re-
sults (gold) [48]. In general, almost all models are stiﬀer
than predicted by the microscopic calculations. Only
eNJL1ωρ2, eNJLxmσρ1, and eNJL3σρ1 models are in-
side the constrained region for a wide range of densities.

suprasaturation it fails, not only to satisfy heavy-ion ﬂow
constraints, but even worse, it predicts a transition to
pure neutron matter at a too low density and therefore,
is not appropriate to describe stellar matter.

B. Subsaturation EoS

At subsaturation densities, homogeneous nuclear mat-
ter is not stable and matter has the tendency to cluster-
ize. Applying the formalisms, CP and CLD, described in
section II B, we present in Fig. 6 the energy per parti-
cle and the pressure versus density obtained for homoge-
neous and clusterized matter, and three diﬀerent types
of matter, β-equilibrium matter and matter with a pro-
ton fraction equal to 0.5 and 0.3. As expected, cluster-
ized matter has a smaller energy per particle. The CLD
and CP methods give similar results, CP giving rise to a
slightly smaller energy per particle due to the fact that
the Coulomb ﬁeld and surface energy contributions are
included after the minimization of the free energy. For
yp = 0.3 and 0.5, there is a ﬁrst order phase transition be-
tween the clusterized phase and the homogeneous phase.
The diﬀerent geometries that are present in the non-
homogeneous phase depend on the proton fraction, model
and method. In Fig. 7, the distribution of the diﬀerent
types of shapes as a function of the density are given for
four models, eNJL1, eNJL1ωρ1, eNJL3 and eNJL3σρ1,
and the two methods, CP and CLD. In all models, β-

equilibrium matter does not contain exotic shapes, and
clusters are all spherical, independently of model and
method, except for a very small region where rods ap-
pear for eNJL3σρ1. This behavior has been obtained in
[54], for models with a large symmetry energy slope at
saturation density. In their analysis, L . 80 MeV was
the condition to obtain other shapes besides droplets.

Matter with yp = 0.3 and 0.5 have, besides droplets,
rods, slabs and tubes. Bubbles are never present. Gen-
erally, the CLD predicts an earlier transition to homo-
geneous matter and larger tube regions, but this is not
always the case.

C. Neutron star

We have built an EoS, appropriate to describe cold stel-
lar matter in β-equilibrium, as explained in the follow-
ing: a) for the outer crust, the Baym-Pethick-Sutherland
(BPS) [30] EoS was taken; b) the inner crust EoS was
obtained within the CP method, and, for reference, we
will also show results where the homogeneous matter EoS
was taken for densities above neutron drip c) the core
of nucleonic stars is described using all models, except
eNJL1ωρ2, none of which predicts the transition to neu-
tron matter at a density below the central density of the
most massive star; d) for the core of hybrid stars, eNJL1
is considered for the hadronic phase, and the quark phase
is described within the su(3) NJL model.

The M (R) curves of the nucleonic stars are plotted in
Figures 8 and 9, and some of their properties are given
in Table III. These properties are the maximum gravita-
tional and baryonic masses and corresponding radii, the
central and chiral symmetry restoration densities, the ra-
dius of a 1.4M⊙ star, and its respective central density.
It is seen that the maximum mass and central densities
do not depend on how the inner crusts are described, but
the radius is sensitive to the crust EoS, a larger radius
being obtained when the pasta is included, see Fig. 9.
This diﬀerence can be as high as 500m for a 1.4 M⊙ star,
and 1km for a 1.0 M⊙ star. The β−equilibrium EoS of
the inner crust, obtained both within the CLD and CP
approaches, are very similar, giving rise to almost iden-
tical radii, as seen in Fig. 9.

Maximum masses are all above two solar masses, satis-
fying the constraint imposed by pulsars PSR J0348+0432
[55] and PSR J1614-2230 [56]. All models predict a cen-
tral core of matter for the maximum mass star with
the chiral symmetry restored, except for eNJL3 and
eNJL3σρ1. However, the 1.4M⊙ stars are formed only of
matter in the broken phase. Conﬁrming previous results
of [57], 1.4 M⊙ stars have a smaller radius for smaller
slopes L. Their radii are quite large, and the smallest
one, obtained including the pasta in the inner crust, is
13.21 km, for a model without current mass in the EoS.
The two models with the same value of L have diﬀerent
incompressibilities, and the larger radius corresponds to
the larger K. Stars within eNJL1 models have larger
maximum masses because they have stiﬀer EoS, see Fig.
2. In the right panels of Fig.8, we show the M/R relation
and mass as a function of the density for the models with

current mass in the EoS. eNJL1mσρ1 is the only one not
to produce a maximum mass star of 2M⊙. All the other
models are within the observational constrains.

We have next built a hybrid star EoS, using the
Maxwell construction to match the hadronic and quark
EoS. Quark matter is described within su(3) NJL with
a vector interaction, and several strengths of this inter-
action are considered. Results are presented in Table IV
and Fig. 10. The following conclusions may be drawn:
a) the hadron-quark phase transition occurs at ρH−Q,
always above the chiral symmetry restoration density,
ρχ = 0.35 fm−3, within eNJL1. Between ρχ and ρH−Q,
there is a phase with the chiral symmetry already re-
stored and nucleon masses zero, but with matter still
hadronized, known as quarkyonic matter in the literature
[58, 59]; b) a core of quark matter is obtained with the
smaller values of the vector coupling considered. Two
of the models result in maximum masses below 2M⊙,
one within one σ mass uncertainty of PSR J1614-2230.
Larger maximum masses are possible if the vector in-
teraction is stronger, but, in this case, the onset of the
quark phase makes the star unstable. This means that
stable stars are purely hadronic, or, at most, contain in
the core a mixed quark-hadron phase. Since ﬁnite size
and Coulomb eﬀects were not taken into account, it is
expected that for these stars quarks may only exist in a
mixed quark-hadron phase and not as pure quark mat-
ter. There are other cases where NJL-type models were
used for the quark matter EoS, and where massive hy-
brid stars were found, see e.g. Ref.
[60] and references
therein.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In the present work, we have described nuclear and
stellar matter within a relativistic nuclear model with
chiral symmetry. At ﬁrst, three parametrizations with
diﬀerent isoscalar properties were considered, having dif-
ferent onset densities for the restoration of chiral sym-
metry. These models present a quite large symmetry en-
ergy slope at normal density and, therefore, four other
models have been proposed with a smaller slope. To
accomplish this new feature, a mixed vector-isovector -
vector-isoscalar term, or a mixed scalar-isoscalar - vector-
isovector term, were included in the Lagrangian density.
Above the restoration of chiral symmetry, the EoS of
symmetric nuclear matter for all models becomes much
stiﬀer. On the other hand, the symmetry energy soft-
ens above the chiral symmetry restoration density and,
at large enough densities, it may even become negative,
mainly if the modiﬁcation of the density dependence of
the symmetry energy is accomplished by including isovec-
tor vector-isoscalar vector mixed terms. A special case

10

is the eNJL3, in which the restoration of the chiral sym-
metry happens at a very high density, ρ ∼ 7ρ0. We have
also implemented two other models, where we consid-
ered a current mass in order to soften the restoration of
the chiral symmetry, making the EoS less stiﬀ. A mixed
scalar-isoscalar - vector-isovector term was added to the
models in order to decrease the slope of the symmetry
energy even further, allowing a softening in the EoS.

The EoS of non-homogeneous subsaturation matter
was built within the CP and the CLD methods, and
we found that within these models, β-equilibrium matter
does not present a non-spherical pasta phase, except for
eNJL3σρ1. Non-spherical shapes will, however, occur for
larger proton fractions, and could exist in core-collapse
supernova matter. However, to describe this kind of mat-
ter, a ﬁnite temperature calculation must be performed.
Having the subsaturation EoS of β-equilibrium matter,
we have built an almost uniﬁed hadronic stellar matter
EoS, with the outer crust described by the BPS EoS,
and the inner crust and core described within the eNJL
model. It was shown that an uncertainty of 0.5 and 1 km
in the radius, respectively, of a 1.4 and a 1.0 M⊙ star is
obtained when the homogeneous matter EoS is used to
describe the inner crust.

For the core, we have considered not only nucleonic
matter, but also a possible phase transition to quark mat-
ter, described within the su(3) NJL model. In the quark
model, we have included a vector term that allows to turn
the quark EoS stiﬀer. All nucleonic star families obtained
with the models that do not predict a neutron instabil-
ity for densities below the central density, the maximum
mass obtained is well above 2M⊙. Including a possible
deconﬁnement phase transition decreases the maximum
mass, to values below 2 M⊙, but within the interval al-
lowed by the PSR J1614-2230, for stars with a pure quark
core, or still above the 2 M⊙ with a core with a mixed
quark-hadron phase. Some of the hybrid stars contain
quarkyonic matter with hadronized matter in a chiral
symmetric phase. Star radii of 1.4 M⊙ are above 12.8
km, most out of the range predicted by [44] and [61], but
within the observations of the objects BNS 4U 1608-522
[62], BNS SAX J1748.9-2021 [63, 64], and RP-MSP PSR
J0437-4715 [65, 66] (see [67]).
