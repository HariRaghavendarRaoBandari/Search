We report detailed study of the transport properties of FeSe1−xSx (x = 0 and 0.14) single crystals
grown by vapor transport method. 14% S doping is found signiﬁcantly suppress the structural
transition from Ts ∼ 86 K in FeSe to ∼ 49 K, although the superconducting transition temperature,
Tc, is only slightly aﬀected. A pronounced linear magnetoresistance (MR) is observed in both
FeSe and FeSe0.86S0.14 single crystals, which is found to be triggered by the structural transition.
The linear MR and related discussion indicate the possible existence of Dirac-cone-like state, which
may come from the band shift induced by ferro-orbital order. The mobility of the Dirac-cone-like
band is found to decrease after S doping. Besides, the invalid Kohler’s scaling of MR is found
for temperature below Ts in both crystals, however the re-establishment of the Kohler’s scaling at
temperatures below 30 K is observed in FeSe, but not in FeSe0.86S0.14. All these observations above
support that the orbital ordering causes the band reconstruction in FeSe, and also that the orbital
ordering in FeSe is suppressed by the chemical pressure from S doping.

I.

INTRODUCTION

FeSe, composed of only Fe-Se layers [1], has the sim-
plest crystal structure in iron-based superconductors
(IBSs) and is also one of the most intriguing candidates
for both searching high-temperature superconductivity
and probing the superconducting mechanism. Although
the initial Tc in FeSe is below 10 K [1], it can be easily
increased to 37 K under pressure [2] and over 40 K by
intercalating space layers [3, 4]. Recently, the monolayer
of FeSe grown on SrTiO3 is reported to show a sign of
superconductivity over 100 K [5].

Diﬀerent from the iron pnictide, in which a tetragonal
to orthorhombic structural transition usually precedes or
coincides with stripe-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) or-
der in close proximity with pressure or chemical doping
[6], FeSe undergoes only the structural transition at Ts
∼ 87 K without long-range magnetic order at any tem-
perature [7]. Such a unique feature makes FeSe an ideal
material to study the nematic order, which is often re-
ferred as the origin of structural transition and is believed
to be related directly to the high-temperature supercon-
ductivity [6, 8, 9], without the inﬂuence of magnetic or-
der. Recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) study on FeSe reported a splitting of the other-
wise degenerate Fe 3dxz and 3dyz orbitals at the M point
of the Brillouin zone. Such splitting of bands is as large
as 50 meV at low temperatures and can persists up to
temperatures of ∼ 110 K above Ts, which indicates that
the electronic nematicity is caused by the ferro-orbital
ordering [10, 11]. It is also supported by the NMR mea-
surements that spin ﬂuctuations only exists below Ts,
which is against spin-driven nematicity [12, 13].

On the other hand, in the nematic state, FeSe also
manifests some special transport properties like the non-
linear Hall resistivity and a sudden sign reversal in the
temperature dependence of the Hall coeﬃcient, together
with an emergence of large magnetoresistance (MR) [14–
16]. Besides, the mobility spectrum analysis and the
three-carrier model ﬁtting all suggest a possible electron-
type carrier with ultrahigh mobility emerges below Ts
[15, 16]. However, until now the origin of the distin-
guished transport property and its relation with the
structural transition in FeSe is still not well studied,
which is crucial to the understanding of its band struc-
ture as well as the novel superconductivity. Initially, the
S-doping eﬀect in FeSe has been studied in polycryat-
slline samples [17]. Recently, high-quality single crystals
of S-doped FeSe have been successfully grown by vapor
transport method, and it is reported that their super-
conducting properties are aﬀected little by the S-doping
[18]. APRES studies found that the S doping reduces
the Ts possibly by the suppression of orbital ordering
[19]. Since the S is isovalent to FeSe, it will not intro-
duce extra charge carriers. And its nonmagnetic nature
will not also disturb the scattering too much. Thus, the
comparative study of transport properties in pure and
S-doped FeSe is helpful to the understanding of the ex-
traordinary transport properties and their relation with
structural transtion/nematic order.

Unfortunately, research about the transport proper-
ties on S-doped FeSe is still left blank.
In this paper,
we report the detailed study of transport properties of
FeSe1−xSx (x = 0, and 0.14) single crystals grown by va-
por transport method. The S doping is found to suppress
the structural transition from ∼ 86 K in FeSe to ∼ 49 K
(x = 0.14), with only slight enhancement of Tc. A lin-
ear magnetoresistance is observed in both crystals, and
is found to be triggered by the structural transition. The

linear MR and related discussion indicate the possible ex-
istence of Dirac-cone like band structure with ultrahigh
mobility, which may come from the ferro-orbital ordering
induced band shift. The mobility of the Dirac-cone-like
band is found to decrease with S doping. Besides, the in-
ﬂuence of S doping to the transport properties and band
structure of FeSe is also studied and discussed, and is at-
tributed to the suppression of orbital ordering from the
chemical pressure of S doping.

II. EXPERIMENT

Single crystals with nominal composition FeSe1−xSx
(x = 0, and 0.2) were grown by the vapor transport
method [20]. Fe and Se/S powers were thoroughly mixed
by grounding in glove box for more than 30 mins, and
sealed in an evacuated quartz tube together with mixture
of AlCl3 and KCl powders. The quartz tube with chem-
icals was loaded into a horizontal tube furnace with one
end heated up to 400◦C, while the other end was kept at
250◦C. After more than 35 days, single crystals with di-
mensitions in millimeter can be obtained in the cold end.
The actual composition of the single crystals was charac-
terized by energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX).
The actually S doping level, obtained by an average of
several diﬀerent points, is ∼ 0.14 for the nominal 20%
sulfur doped crystal.
Structure of the crystals was characterized by means
of X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) with Cu-Kα radiation. Mi-
crostructural and compositional
investigations of the
crystals were performed using a scanning electron micro-
scope (SEM) equipped with EDX. Magnetization mea-
surements were performed using a commercial SQUID
magnetometer (MPMS-XL5, Quantum Design). The
Hall resistivity ρyx and magnetoresistance ρxx were mea-
sured by using the six-lead method with the applied ﬁeld
parallel to c-axis and perpendicular to the applied cur-
rent. In order to decrease the contact resistance, we sput-
tered gold on the contact pads just after the cleavage,
then gold wires were attached on the pads with silver
paste, producing contacts with ultralow resistance (<100
µΩ).

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Fig. 1(a) shows the single crystal XRD patterns for
the FeSe and FeSe0.86S0.14 single crystals. Only the
(00l) peaks are observed, suggesting that the crystallo-
graphic c-axis is perfectly perpendicular to the plane of
the single crystals. With S doping, the positions of (00l)
peaks obviously shift to higher values of 2θ, which can
be seen more clearly in the enlarged part of (003) peaks
shown in Fig. 1(b). Fig. 1(d) shows the SEM photo
of the FeSe0.86S0.14 single crystal. From the correspond-
ing EDX spectra shown in Fig. 1(c), the spectrum peak
from S can be clearly identiﬁed, which together with the

obvious shift in XRD pattern prove that the S is success-
fully doped into the crystal. Compositional mappings in
the selected rectangular region of Fig. 1(d) are shown in
Figs. 1(e)-(g), which prove that Fe, Se and S are almost
homogeneously distributed in the crystal.

Fig. 1(h) shows the temperature dependence of mag-
netic susceptibility χ at 5 Oe for FeSe and FeSe0.86S0.14
single crystals. FeSe displays a superconducting transi-
tion temperature Tc ∼ 9.0 K, which is slightly enhanced
after S doping to ∼ 9.5 K in FeSe0.86S0.14. Such a slight
enhancement of Tc is similar to the previous report [18].
Taking the criteria of 10 and 90% of the magnetization
result at 2 K, the superconducting transition width, ∆Tc,
for both crystals is estimated ≤ 0.5 K, which manifests
the single superconducting phase of our single crystals.
More information about the magnetization properties of
the FeSe single crystal was reported in our previous pub-
lication [21].

Fig. 2(a) shows the temperature dependence of in-
plane resistivity for FeSe single crystal, which manifests
a metallic behavior until temperature decreasing to Tc.
The residual resistivity ratio RRR, deﬁned as R(300
K)/R(10 K), is of ∼ 33. Such a large value of RRR
is close to the recent report of a clean single crystal with
impurities less than one per 2000 Fe atoms [22], which
manifests that our single crystal contains few impuri-
ties/defects. An obvious kink-like behavior related to the
structural transition is also observed which is similar to
previous reports [22], and can be seen more clearly in the
derivative of temperature dependent resistivity, dρ/dT ,
plotted also in Fig. 2(a). The structural transition tem-
perature, Ts, deﬁned as the temperature at which dρ/dT

takes its minimum value as masked by the arrow, is ∼
86 K for FeSe. After S doping, Ts is considerably sup-
pressed to ∼ 49 K for FeSe0.86S0.14 as shown in Fig. 2(b),
although the value of Tc is aﬀected little. According to
the recent ARPES measurement, the suppression of Ts
may come from the suppression of orbital ordering by
chemical pressure either from physical pressure or from
S doping [19].

To get more information about the diﬀerence before
and after structural transition, we also performed tem-
perature dependent resistivity measurements under mag-
netic ﬁelds up to 9 T for FeSe and FeSe0.86S0.14, as shown
in the insets of Figs. 2(c) and (d), respectively. For both
crystals, resistivities are almost ﬁeld independent above
Ts, and can fall into one curve. Such behavior is com-
mon in compensated metal since the amounts of elec-
trons and holes are equal. Besides, the S is isovalent to
Se, which introduces no extra electrons or holes. Thus,
both crystals show ﬁeld-independent resistivity above Ts.
However, an obvious divergence for resistivity under dif-
ferent ﬁelds can be observed immediately below Ts for
both crystals. This behavior can be seen more clearly

3

from the diﬀerence between ρ(T ) measured under a ﬁeld
of 9 T and 0 T as shown in the main panels of Figs.
2(c) and (d). Obviously, (ρ9T - ρ0T ) increases drasti-
cally below Ts. For FeSe, such a divergence under Ts is
explained by the electron-hole inequality proposed based
on the asymmetry of dI/dV curves in scanning tunneling
spectroscopy (STS) [23]. Our results manifest that such
an asymmetry may be also present in FeSe0.86S0.14, and
happens immediately below Ts for both crystals, which
indicates that such behavior is triggered by the structural
transition.

In order to get more comprehensive understanding of
the transport properties, we also measured the Hall resis-
tivity, ρyx, for both crystals at temperatures above and
below Ts. Typical results of ﬁeld dependent ρyx at low
temperatures for FeSe and FeSe0.86S0.14 single crystals
are shown in the insets of Figs. 2(e) and (f), respectively.
Field dependence of ρyx for FeSe becomes obviously non-
linear below 80 K, and even changes to negative values
at low temperatures, which is similar to previous reports
[15, 16]. On the other hand, after S doping, ρyx keeps
positive and linearly increases with magnetic ﬁeld at all
temperatures for FeSe0.86S0.14. Hall coeﬃcients RH can
be simply obtained from RH = ρyx/µ0H, and are shown
in the main panels of Fig. 2(e) and (f). For the nonlinear
ρyx at low temperatures in FeSe, RH is simply calculated
from the linearly part at low ﬁelds. The values of RH
are small above 100 K, and show similar temperature de-
pendent behavior, changing sign twice, for both crystals.
Such temperature dependent behavior of RH for FeSe
is very similar to previous report [16]. The small abso-
lute value of RH can be easily understood by considering
a simply compensated two-band model containing equal
numbers of electron- and hole-type charge carriers with
similar mobility. And the sign change means that the
temperature dependence of the mobilities for electrons
and holes are not completely equal. RH of FeSe0.86S0.14
shows almost identical behavior as that of FeSe, conﬁrm-
ing the isovalent nature of S-doping. It ensures that the
eﬀect of S doping is mainly caused by the chemical pres-
sure rather than the charge carriers doping.

On the other hand, when temperature decreases be-
tween 100 K and Ts, RH for both crystals shows a pos-
itive value, and increases with decreasing temperatures.
Such behavior may come from the change of mobility,
which means that the hole-type carriers become more
dominant at this temperature region. When temperature
decreases below Ts, RH of FeSe shows a quick decrease,
and changes sign from positive to negative, forming a
hump-like structure in RH - T curve. Such a hump-like
structure is also observed in FeSe0.86S0.14, although the
value of RH keeps positive at all temperatures. The de-
crease of RH (even a sign change in FeSe) indicates that
the electron-type charge carriers contribute more (even
becomes dominant in FeSe) to the transport properties
before temperature decreasing to Tc. Here, we want to
point out that the peak position of the hump in RH -
T is slightly below Ts, which is reasonable because the

peak in RH should show up when the decreasing trend
conquers the increasing trend of RH although the con-
tribution of decreasing RH may begin from Ts. Such
noticeable temperature dependent RH reﬂects the multi-
band nature of both crystals. Besides, recent mobility
spectrum analysis and three-band model ﬁtting on FeSe
attributed the striking change in RH to the emergence
of a small electron band with ultrahigh mobility [15, 16].
We will discuss this point in detail below in the part of
MR.

To further investigate the inﬂuence of structural tran-
sition and S doping to the transport properties and band
structure of FeSe, we also studied the MR of both crys-
tals. Fig. 3(a) show the magnetic ﬁeld dependence of
magnetoresistance (MR=((ρ(H) − ρ(0))/ρ(0)) for FeSe
single crystal at diﬀerent temperatures. Obviously, MR
of FeSe at temperature higher than Ts shows a relative
smaller value, ≤ 1%, which is expected for conventional
compensated metal with modest mobilities. While, the
value of MR increases dramatically with temperature be-
low Ts, and reaches a large value over 200% at 12 K under
9 T. The large value of MR at low temperatures is similar
to previous reports [15, 16]. similar temperature depen-
dent behavior of MR is also observed in FeSe0.86S0.14 as
shown in Fig. 3(b) that MR shows a small value at tem-
peratures above 40 K, and increases quickly below Ts.
However, the value of MR for FeSe0.86S0.14 is more than
1 order smaller than that of FeSe.

More interestingly, the MR below Ts tends to increase
with magnetic ﬁeld in a more linear relation at high ﬁeld
region for both crystals, whereas a small parabolic-like
bend just remains at low ﬁelds. This is in sharp contrast

to the semiclassical quadratic ﬁeld dependence of MR, in
which MR generally develops in proportion to B2 over
the entire ﬁeld range. Such behavior can be witnessed
more evidently in the ﬁrst-order derivative d(M R)/dB
as shown in Figs. 3(c) and (d) for FeSe and FeSe0.86S0.14,
respectively. d(M R)/dB linearly increases with mag-
netic ﬁeld at small ﬁelds, which indicates a classic B2
dependence of MR. While, above a characteristic ﬁeld
B∗, d(M R)/dB saturates to a much reduced slope. Such
an abrupt reduction of slope in MR with increasing ﬁeld,
masked by the solid lines in Fig. 3(c), is usually under-
stood by the contribution of a linear ﬁeld dependent MR
plus a quadratic term. Therefore, the MR below and
above B∗ can be usually expressed as [24]

M R =(A2[µ0H]2

µ0H < B∗,
A1µ0H + O[µ0H]2 µ0H > B∗,

(1)

where A2 is the coeﬃcient for B2 terms when µ0H < B∗;
A1 and O are the coeﬃcients for B linear and B2 terms
when µ0H > B∗. By using the formula above, we ﬁtted
the magnetic ﬁeld dependent MR at diﬀerent tempera-
tures for both FeSe and FeSe0.86S0.14 single crystals. The
obtained parameters are compared and shown in Fig. 4.
It is obvious that all the parameters decrease with in-
creasing temperature. The values of O are smaller than
those of A1 for both crystals, which indicates that the
linear MR is more dominant in the transport proper-
ties for µ0H > B∗. Besides, the values of A1 and O

for FeSe0.86S0.14 are much smaller than those of FeSe,
which manifests that the observed suppression of MR by
S-doping has eﬀects on both linear and the quadratic
terms.

The linear MR observed in single crystal is usually
interpreted by considering a quantum limit where all
the carriers occupy only the lowest Laudau level (LL)
[25, 26]. This situation usually happens when the ﬁeld is
very large and the diﬀerence between the zeroth and ﬁrst
Landau levels ∆LL exceeds the Fermi energy EF and the
thermal ﬂuctuations kBT . In such a quantum limit, MR
can no longer be described in the framework of the con-
ventional Born scattering approximation, and is instead
expressed as:

where Ni is the density of scattering centers, n is the

In a con-
ventional parabolic band, the LL is proportional to B,
∆LL = eB/m∗, where m∗ is the eﬀective mass. To
satisfy the quantum limit,
i.e., ∆LL > kBT , a very
large value of magnetic ﬁeld is needed. Thus, the lin-
ear MR coming from the quantum limit is diﬃcult to
be observed in a moderate ﬁeld range. By contrast,
the linear MR was identiﬁed in low ﬁeld region in some
materials hosting Dirac fermions with linear energy dis-
persion, such as graphene [27], topological
insulators
[28], Ag2−δ(Te/Se) [29], α-(BEDT-TTF)2I3 [30], some
layered compounds with two-dimensional Fermi surface
(like SrMnBi2) [31, 32] and iron-based Ba(Sr)Fe2As2
[33–35], La(Pr)FeAsO [36, 37], and a related compound
FeTe0.6Se0.4 [38]. For the Dirac state, ∆LL is described as

∆LL = ±vF√2eB, leading to a much larger LL split-

ting compared with the parabolic band. Consequently,
the quantum limit can be achieved in low ﬁeld region
[25].

Now, we discuss a little more about the behavior of MR
above B∗ for materials holding Dirac fermions. For ma-
terials with single band, all the carriers occupy only the
lowest Laudau level when the ∆LL is opened under mag-
netic ﬁeld. In such a case, the high-ﬁeld MR will show
only linear behavior, and the d(M R)/dB is almost ﬁeld
independent. For materials with multiband, when the
carriers in one or several bands fall into Dirac cone state,
those carriers become Dirac fermions with very high mo-
bility. In this situation, if the mobility of other carriers
from normal bands is much smaller than the mobility of
Dirac fermions, the Dirac fermions will be dominant in
the transport, and the contribution of normal state carri-
ers becomes negligible. Thus, the high-ﬁeld MR will also
show only linear behavior, and the d(M R)/dB is again
ﬁeld independent. On the other hand, if the mobility
of carriers from normal bands is not much smaller than
that of the Dirac fermions, like the case of FeSe (Based
on the three-band model ﬁtting [16], the mobility of car-
riers from normal bands is ∼ 7,000 cm2/Vs at 20 K, and

acteristic ﬁeld B ∗ and the eﬀective MR mobility µM R for FeSe

tals, respectively. Red solid and dashed lines are the ﬁtting

that of the possible Dirac fermions is ∼ 25,000 cm2/Vs.),
the transport results will manifest combined properties of
both the normal carriers and Dirac fermions. Thus, the
high-ﬁeld MR shows a reduced slope, which is combined
with the linear and quadratic terms, rather than the sim-
ple linear behavior. Actually, such behavior of reduced
slope in MR is also observed before in other compounds
like Sr(Ca)MnBi2 [32, 39] and Ba(Sr)Fe2As2[24, 34, 35].
Here, we should point out that the contribution of lin-
ear MR is only observed at temperatures below Ts. As
shown in the insets of Figs. 3(c) and (d), the two slopes
behavior in d(M R)/dB is suppressed and replaced by
a unique slope when temperature increases to 70 K for
FeSe, and 40 K for FeSe0.86S0.14, respectively.
It indi-
cates that the emergence of Dirac fermions is triggered
by structural transition.

The temperature dependence of characteristic ﬁeld B∗
for FeSe is shown in Fig.
5, which is obviously vi-
olating the linear relation expected from conventional
parabolic bands, and can be well ﬁtted by B∗ =
(1/2ev2
F )(kBT +EF )2 for the Dirac fermions as shown
by the red solid curve in Fig. 5 [28]. The good agree-
ment of B∗ with the above equation supports the ex-
istence of possible Dirac fermions in FeSe. The ﬁtting
gives a large Fermi velocity vF ∼ 9.1 × 104 ms−1, which
is close to the previous reports in iron-based BaFe2As2
(vF ∼ 1.9 × 105 ms−1) [33], SrFe2As2 (vF ∼ 3.1 × 105
ms−1) [35], and the related compound FeTe0.6Se0.4 (vF ∼
1.1 × 105 ms−1) [38]. Actually, the emergence of an extra
band with ultrahigh mobility after structural transition
in FeSe is also supported by the mobility spectrum anal-
ysis and three-band model ﬁtting [15, 16]. On the other
hand, in a multiband system with both Dirac and coven-
tional parabolic band where Dirac carriers are dominant
in transport, the prefactor A2 for the B2 term is related

√σeσh
σe+σh

to the eﬀective MR mobility √A2 =
(µe+µh) =
µM R [24, 28]. The eﬀective MR is smaller than the aver-
age mobility of carriers µavg = (µe + µh)/2, and gives an
estimation of the lower bound. Temperature dependence
of µM R was calculated and shown by the solid square
in Fig. 5. The values of µM R mainly reside in the or-
der of 103 cm2/Vs similar to the estimation by mobility
spectrum and three-band model ﬁtting [15, 16]. µM R de-
creases with increasing temperature since thermal ﬂuc-
tuations smear out the LL splitting.

The temperature dependence of B∗ and µM R for
FeSe0.86S0.14 are plotted in open symbols, and compared
with those from FeSe shown in Fig. 5. Obvious, the
values of B∗ is largely enhanced after S doping, and the
ﬁtting gives a Fermi velocity vF ∼ 7.4 × 104 ms−1. The
similar temperature dependence of B∗ in FeSe0.86S0.14
indicates that the Dirac fermions may also exist in this
material. The reduced vF indicates that the Dirac-cone-
like band structure is suppressed by S doping. Besides,
µM R is also found to be reduced to a value smaller than
500 cm2/Vs.

The Dirac cone state is also observed in iron pnictide
BaFe2As2, and is found to be a consequence of the nodes
in the SDW gap by complex zone folding [40], and it can
coexist with superconductivity in Ru-doped BaFe2As2
until the complete suppression of SDW [41, 42]. Similar
results have also been reported in Ru-doped LaFeAsO
[36]. Such a mechanism is not suitable for FeSe since
no magnetic order occurs belows Ts [7]. The possible
Dirac-cone-like band structure found here may come from
the band shift, which is caused by ferro-orbital ordering.
In detail, the dyz band in the nematic state shifts up
around the Mx point, while, the dxz band shifts down-
wards around the My point and opens a hybridization
gap with the dxy band, which enlarges the electron pocket
at the My point [43]. In addition, the band structure cal-
culation in orbital ordered state considering the orbital-
spin interplay shows that the electron Fermi surface at
X-point will be deformed to two pockets with Dirac-cone
dispersions [44]. It can also explain the observed suppres-
sion of Dirac-cone-like band structure by S doping that
the band shift is reduced because of the suppression of
orbital ordering by the chemical pressure from S doping
[19].

In principle, the band reconstruction induced by the
orbital-ordering is the origin of dramatic change in
transport properties when decreasing temperature be-
low Ts. To get more comprehensive understanding of
the S-doping eﬀect, we replot the ﬁeld dependent MR
measured under diﬀerent temperatures in Kohler’s law
[45],
in which the MR can be successfully scaled by
∆ρ(H)/ρ(0) = F (ωcτ ) = F [(µ0H/ρ(0))2], where F is
a function of the cyclotron frequency ωc and scattering
time τ if the scattering rate for charge carriers are equal
at all points on the Fermi surface. The Kohler’s scaling of
the MR for FeSe and FeSe0.86S0.14 are shown in Figs. 6(a)
and (b), respectively. Since the existence of linear MR
from Dirac-cone-like band structure will dramatically en-

FIG. 6. (Color online) MR of (a) FeSe, and (b) FeSe0.86S0.14
single crystals plotted as a function of (µ0H/ρxx)2.
Inset
of (a) is the enlarged plot for the MR of FeSe measured at
temperature ranging from 90 K to 200 K.

hance the value of MR below Ts especially under large
ﬁelds, we mainly focus on the part below B∗. Obviously,
the MR for both crystals above Ts (T ≥ 90 K for FeSe,
T ≥ 50 K for FeSe0.86S0.14) can be well scaled into one
curve, which means that the scattering rate is isotropic.
For FeSe, the scale of MR by Kohler’s law above Ts can
be seen more clearly in the enlarged plot as shown in the
inset. Below Ts, the invalidity of Kohler’s law can be ob-
served for both crystals, indicating the anisotropic scat-
tering rates. Such behavior is also observed in cuprates
and iron pnicitides, and is usually attributed to the ex-
istence of hot and cold spots on the Fermi surface with
anisotropic scattering rate [46, 47]. The hot and cold
spots are usually caused by the scattering from spin ﬂuc-
tuations, which is only observed below Ts in FeSe [12, 13].
The invalidity of Kohler’s law in FeSe0.86S0.14 is also ob-
served below Ts, which seems to suggest that the emer-
gence of spin ﬂuctuations is triggered by or strongly re-
lated to the structural transition/orbital ordering as also
proposed by the NMR result in FeSe [13].

Surprisingly, however, the Kohler’s scaling becomes
valid again when temperature decreases below ∼ 30 K in
FeSe, and such behavior is absent in FeSe0.86S0.14. Pre-
vious report attributed the re-establishment of Kohler’s
law to the opening of a gap ∼ 8 meV above Tc presum-
ably at the hot spots of the Fermi surface based on their
STM spectroscopy results [23]. However, such large gap
is not observed by other measurements or the other STM
reports [48, 49]. The re-establishment of Kohler’s scal-
ing can be also explained by the orbital-ordering-driven
band reconstruction, in which the elliptical Fermi surface
emerged below Ts as explained above, will go on shrink-
ing with decreasing temperature and eventually turns
into two small circular ones as shown in Fig. 2(c) of
ref.
[43]. Because of that, the scattering rate may be-
come isotropic again because of the disappear of hot and
cold spots. Furthermore, the orbital ordering was found
to be suppressed after S doping based on the discussion

7

above, which may not be strong enough to totally split
the shrunk Fermi surface into two separated ones. Thus,
the anisotropic scattering rate persists and the Kohler’s
scaling remains invalid at low temperatures below Ts in
FeSe0.86S0.14. Future experiments such as the ARPES or
STM on S-doped FeSe are required to clarify this obser-
vation.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we investigated the transport properties
of FeSe1−xSx (x = 0, and 0.14) single crystals grown by
vapor transport method. The structural transition was
found suppressed from 86 K to 49 K after S doping, while
the Tc is only slightly enhanced from 9 K to 9.5 K. The
non-linear ﬁeld dependence of Hall resistivity observed
below Ts in FeSe was found to be replaced by linear
behavior at all temperatures in FeSe0.86S0.14. A linear
MR triggered by the structural transition is observed in
both FeSe and FeSe0.86S0.14 single crystals, indicating the

possible existence of Dirac-cone state, which may come
from the ferro-orbital ordering caused by band shift. The
mobility of the Dirac-cone-like band was obviously sup-
pressed by S doping. Besides, the invalid Kohler’s scal-
ing of MR was found at temperature below Ts in both
crystals. The Kohler’s scaling becomes valid again at
temperatures below 30 K in FeSe. However, such a re-
establishment is absent after S doping. The observation
and related discussion support that the orbital ordering
motivated the band reconstruction in FeSe, and also man-
ifest that the orbital ordering in FeSe can be suppressed
by chemical pressure, e.g. S doping or physical pressure,
which is promising for future understanding of the origin
of the nematic state in FeSe as well as its relation to the
novel superconductivity.
