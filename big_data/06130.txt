The data obtained by the LHC collaborations clearly show that supersymmetric

models are not realized in nature in a vanilla form and that in particular strongly

interacting supersymmetric particles are most likely heavier than expected. An ex-

ception are the partners of the third generation quarks, which also play a dominant

role in the breaking of the electroweak symmetry. We consider here an extended

class of so-called ‘natural supersymmetric models’ where we allow for a sneutrino as

the lightest supersymmetric particle as it appears for example in left-right symmet-

ric models and/or models where supersymmetry is explained via an inverse seesaw

mechanism. We evaluate how much existing ATLAS data constrain such scenarios

and obtain roughly a bound of 300 GeV on the charginos if the sneutrinos are lighter

than about 120 GeV. For the stop we ﬁnd that only masses up to 300 GeV are

excluded independent of the mixing angle. For larger values the exclusion depends

on the detail of the scenario and if the mass exceeds 800 GeV no bound is obtained.

INTRODUCTION

2

The search for supersymmetry (SUSY) is among the main priorities of the LHC collabora-

tions. Up to now no sign for supersymmetry or any signiﬁcant deviation from the Standard

Model (SM) prediction has been found. In contrast, the last particle predicted by the SM

has been found [1, 2] marking one of the most important milestones in particle physics. Its
mass is already known rather precisely: mh = 125.09 ± 0.21 (stat.) ±0.11 (syst.) GeV [3].
Moreover, the strengths of the various LHC-signals are also close to the SM predictions.

The combination of the Higgs discovery with the (yet) unsuccessful searches has led to the

introduction of a model class called ‘natural SUSY’ [4–15]. The basic idea of this class of

models is to take only those SUSY particles close the electroweak scale which do give a

sizeable contribution to the mass of the Higgs boson in order to avoid a too large tuning of

parameters and to take all other particles at the multi-TeV scale. In particular, the higgsinos

(the partners of the Higgs bosons), the light stop (the partner of the top-quark) and in case

that it is mainly a left-stop also the light sbottom are assigned masses of the order of a few

hundred GeV. In addition the gluino and the heavier stop should be close to the TeV scale.

In the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) the mass of the Higgs boson is

corrections close to 90% as m2

bounded to be below the mass of the Z-boson at tree level implying the need of huge radiative
Z + 862 GeV. Due to the large Yukawa couplings of the
top-quark such corrections can indeed be achieved by the requirement of either a large

h (cid:39) m2

geometric average of the stop masses and/or a large left-right mixing parameter At. In non-

minimal extensions, the tree-level bound can be pushed to larger values due to the extra

F -contributions as in the NMSSM [16–23] or due to extra D-term contributions in models

with an enlarged gauge group [24–29].

The searches for the stop in various channels have been carried out in the context of

the MSSM by the ATLAS collaboration, see e.g. [30–33] and the CMS collaboration, see

e.g. [34–37]. The reinterpretation of the corresponding data in terms of natural SUSY in

the MSSM context has been carried out in [38–41], of scenarios based on a compressed

spectrum between higgsino and gluino in [42], the natural NMSSM in [43] and in a scenario

with R-sneutrinos in [44].

In this paper we will focus on models which can emerge as a low energy limit from the

breaking of an extended gauge sector. If these models are left-right symmetric then one has

3

also to include right-handed neutrinos and their superpartners, the R-sneutrinos. Here it

might well be that actually the lightest R-sneutrino is the lightest supersymmetric particle

(LSP). In these models, the neutrino Yukawa couplings are rather small if neutrino physics

is explained via a low scale seesaw mechanism of type I [45–49]. Provided that this results

in rather long life-times of the next to lightest SUSY particle (NLSP), e.g. in case that the

stop is the NLSP one expects it to live so long that it can actually leave the detector [50]. In
such cases the searches for R-hadrons apply resulting in a mass bound of about (cid:39) 900 GeV
[51, 52]. Similarly also the case of a chargino NLSP would lead to a stable particle at the

relevant time scales of collider measurements. However, it might well be that an inverse

seesaw mechanism [53] is the correct explanation of the observed neutrino data. In this case

the neutrino Yukawa couplings are in general large enough that the NLSP decays inside the

collider. Here we will focus on such scenarios and study to which extent the bounds on

the stop masses are changed compared to the MSSM searches. Similar scenarios, motivated

by dark matter arguments, have been considered in [54, 55]. This work diﬀers in several

aspects: (i) in their case the resulting R-sneutrino is mainly of τ ﬂavour type whereas we

will investigate the case where all three lepton ﬂavours contribute signiﬁcantly. Also the

part of the parameter space considered diﬀers from ours. (ii) They use the package SModelS

[56] to obtain the constraints whereas we will use the CheckMATE [57]. While CheckMATE,

ATOM [58, 59], PGS [60] or MadAnalysis [61–63] deduce limits with a detector simulation

for generated events, SModelS or Fastlim [59] constrain models by comparing the cross-

section times branching ratio for certain topologies with the observed upper limits taking

the respective eﬃciencies into account. PGS has been used in [44] and there only the case
of a pure right-handed stop ˜tR has been considered in detail, whereas we will present here

results for various stop mixing angles.

In the next section we will introduce the model focussing on the parts relevant for this

investigation. In section III we summarize the relevant LHC analyses as implemented in the

package CheckMATE [57], as well as the generation of the underlying Monte-Carlo data. In

section IV we present our results and conclude ﬁnally in section V.

II. THE MODEL

4

The simpliﬁed model under consideration is based on the relevant Natural SUSY particle

content, where one adds to the SM the superpartners of the third generation squarks, the
two stops ˜t1,2 and the two sbottoms ˜b1,2, and the partners of the Higgs-bosons, the so-called

higgsinos consisting of two neutral states and a charged one. As usual we will assume that
the heavier sbottom ˜b2 is too heavy to contribute wherever possible but it will turn out that

in some case it has to be included for consistency. Moreover, we add three R-sneutrinos ˜νR,k

(k = e, µ, τ ) which take over the role of the lightest supersymmetric particle(s) (LSP) and,

thus, they can form the dark matter of the Universe as we assume conserved R-parity, see

e.g. [64–73]. To be more precise, we consider a scenario where neutrino-data are explained
via an inverse seesaw and, thus, one needs in addition three ﬁelds ˜Sk which carry lepton

number as well. However, for our purposes they are essentially decoupled apart from the

mixing with the R-sneutrinos. The same holds for the heavy neutrino-states. In principle

they could show up in the decays of the SUSY particles but the corresponding decay widths

(cid:17)

(cid:88)

(cid:16)

k

are kinematically suppressed. All other supersymmetric particles are assumed to be too

heavy to play any role here. The relevant part of the superpotential reads as

Yν,k ˆνR,k(cid:98)Hu ·(cid:98)Lk + Mk(cid:98)Sk ˆνR,k

Wef f = µ(cid:98)Hu · (cid:98)Hd + YtˆtR(cid:98)Hu · (cid:98)Q + Yb(cid:98)bR(cid:98)Q · (cid:98)Hd +
would have to add a term(cid:80)

where the · indicates the SU (2) invariant product. For the explanation of neutrino data one

jk µjk(cid:98)Sj(cid:98)Sk where max(|µjk|) has to be much smaller than any

of the masses discussed here. Therefore, we can safely neglect it here as its eﬀect would be

a tiny mass splitting between the real and imaginary parts of the sneutrinos, see e.g. [74],

which is not measurable at the LHC or even an ILC. The existence of the µjk allows us also

to take Yν as ﬂavour diagonal. The corresponding soft SUSY breaking terms are given by

It is well known that there can be a sizeable mixing between L- and R-states in case of

third generation squarks which is expressed by

Here we use the convention that m˜t1 ≤ m˜t2 and m˜b1 ≤ m˜b2. In the following we will take the
masses of the physical states as well as the mixing angles θ˜t and θ˜b as free parameters. Note
that only ﬁve out of the six parameters can be chosen freely as the parameter m2
in the mass matrices of both, ˜t and ˜b implying the following relation

at tree-level. Therefore we take as input m˜t1, m˜t2, m˜b1, θ˜t and θ˜b. In case of θ˜t = 0 it can
happen that the calculated m˜b2 is actually smaller than the input value for m˜b1. In such
cases we will relabel the corresponding states according to the correct mass ordering.

In the slepton sector we have a mixing between ˜νR and ˜S. Neglecting generation mixing

one ﬁnds the following mass matrix

(2.5)

For completeness we note that there are corrections proportional to the left-right mixing in

the sneutrino sector of the L-slepton masses squared which we neglect here as the L-sleptons
are assumed to be very heavy. Provided that the |Mk|2 has a similar size as BMk one ﬁnds
a rather light state with mass of order |Mk|2 − |BMk| and a rather heavy state with mass
of |Mk|2 + |BMk| and a nearly maximal mixing. Despite the nearly maximal mixing we still
call the light states ˜νR in an obvious abuse of language. We will neglect for simplicity in the

following generation mixing in this sector and assume that the three lightest states are mass-

degenerate to reduce the number of free parameters. In the same spirit we will assume that

Yν is diagonal and that all entries have the same size. This set-up is equivalent to assuming

only one light ˜νR-state which couples with equal strength to all charged leptons and the

charged Higgs boson. We will also comment on the expected changes when departing from

these assumptions.

The masses of the higgsino-like neutralinos ˜χ0

±
1 are given by |µ|
up to small corrections of order O(mZ/min(|M1|,|M2|)), see e.g. [75]. The resulting mass
diﬀerences are at most a few GeV and will be neglected in the following because the visible
products of the corresponding decays, e.g. ˜χ+
1 → ˜χ0
1π+, are very soft and cannot be detected
at the LHC. Thus we will set m ˜χ±
= |µ|. Last but not least we assume also the
gluino to be too heavy to be produced at the LHC with √s = 8 GeV at a sizeable rate.

Summarizing, we have thus the following set of eight free parameters: m˜t1, m˜t2, m˜b1, θ˜t, θ˜b,
m˜νR, Yν and µ.

We assume, as mentioned above, that the ˜νR is the LSP and, thus, we have essentially

two diﬀerent mass orderings depending on whether the squarks are lighter or heavier than

the higgsinos. In the second case the squarks decay according to

with i = 1, 2. If there is a suﬃcient large mass splitting, then there are in addition bosonic

ﬁnal states [76] which we take into account as well

˜t1 → W +˜bi ,
˜t2 → ˜t1h0

˜bi → W
˜t2 → ˜t1Z 0 ,

(2.8)

(2.9)

whose relative importance depends on the mixings in the stop- and sbottom sectors, respec-

tively. In case that only the fermionic decay modes are allowed at a sizable rate, then the

ﬁnal states of stops and sbottoms are practically the same in the standard Natural SUSY

scenarios as the decay products of of ˜χ0

±
2 and ˜χ
1 are too soft to be detected, e.g. all hig-

gsino like states lead to the same missing energy signatures as the LSP. In our scenario the

higgsinos will decay further to

i

1 → ˜νRi(cid:96)+
˜χ+
˜χ0
1/2 → ˜νRiνi

with (cid:96)i = e, µ, τ . This results in cascade decays with ﬁnal states like

˜t1 → bl+˜νRi
˜b1 → tl

˜t1 → tνi˜νRi

In case that the higgsinos are heavier than the squarks one has the same ﬁnal states which are

now mediated via oﬀ-shell higgsinos1 resulting in somewhat changed angular distributions

between the charged fermions, e.g. in the b l and the t l systems. A typical example for

1 In our calculation we take also the oﬀ-shell gauginos into account in this case whose contribution is however

suppressed as they are substantially heavier than the higgsinos.

m˜νR = 100 GeV, µ = 590 GeV, M1 = M2 = 1 TeV. The upper row shows sbottom decays, the

lower row stop decays. The left column displays the case tan β = 10 and right one tan β = 50.

The lines correspond to ˜q1 → qν ˜νR (blue line) and ˜q1 → q(cid:48)l˜νR (green line) summing over all lepton

ﬂavours. By construction each lepton ﬂavour has the same probability.

the branching ratios is shown in Fig. 1. An important observation is that for large tan β

the ﬁnal states containing a t-quark get reduced and correspondingly the ﬁnal states with

a b-quark are enhanced. The reason is that for smaller tan β the kinematical diﬀerences

are compensated to some extent by the diﬀerences in the corresponding Yukawa couplings.

The kink in the stop branching ratios close to cos θ˜t = 0.95 is due to a negative interference

between the higgsino component, which is suppressed by sin θ˜t, and the gaugino component
of the ˜t1-b- ˜χ+

III. SET-UP AND PARAMETER SPACE SCAN

For this investigation we have used a series of public programs: As a ﬁrst step we have used

SARAH [77–81] in the SUSY/BSM toolbox 1.2.9 [82, 83] to implement the aforementioned

model into the event generator WHIZARD 2.2.6 [84, 85]. We use the CTEQ6L1 PDF set

[86] in WHIZARD, which uses PYTHIA 6.427 [87] internally for showering and hadronization

with the ATLAS AUET2B-CT6L tune to generate events at tree-level. The parameter scan

has been automated using gnu-parallel [88]. As default we generate 25000 events for

every production process via strong interactions, e.g. for pp → ˜t1˜t∗

1. The generated events

are then fed in the HEPMC [89] format into CheckMATE 1.2.0 [57] that uses internally a

modiﬁed version of Delphes as detector simulation [90], FastJet [91, 92] to deﬁne jets

via the anti-kT algorithm [93]. These event samples are then re-weighted according to

the corresponding total cross-section which we compute with PROSPINO 2.1 [94, 95] to get a

more reliable result. CheckMATE compares the number of events passing each signal region of

every considered analysis with the observed S95 limit obtained by the ATLAS collaboration

via the parameter

rc
exp/obs =

S − 1.96 · ∆S

S95

exp/obs

(3.1)

with S being the number of the considered signal region, ∆S as the error from the Monte

Carlo and S95

exp/obs is the expected or experimentally observed 95% conﬁdence limit on the

signal [39, 57].

CheckMATE contains also CMS analyses which we did not exploit here for a practical

reason:

in the version used one can combine easily diﬀerent analyses carried out by one

collaboration in a single run but not those carried out by two diﬀerent collaborations. Thus

their inclusion would have nearly doubled our computation time. In view of the fact, that

both collaborations have obtained rather similar results, we do not expect any signiﬁcant

diﬀerences from the results obtained here compared to the combined analyses of both collab-

orations. The analyses used here are listed in table I together with their main characteristics.

The fact, that we consider a ˜νR LSP implies that we expect on average more charged

leptons in the ﬁnal state than in the conventional Natural SUSY scenarios. This implies

that the relative importance of the analyses gets changed on which we want to comment.

Obviously the realm of multilepton searches is of much bigger importance in our case, in

particular due to the better detectability of the leptons compared to jets. A prominent

chargino can be either on- or oﬀ-shell, and additional lepton(s) from the t decay(s). Another

example where this is important are those containing the decay ˜b1 → ˜χ±t → l˜νRt, where the
→ t(cid:96)˜νRW ± where the W decays
example are scenarios containing decays like ˜t1 → ˜bW ±

into leptons.

Dilepton searches retain their importance, especially in the derivation of limits for ˜t1 via

10

±
the process ˜t → ˜χ±b(cid:96) via an on- or oﬀ-shell ˜χ
1 in the 2(cid:96)2b /ET ﬁnal state. This has also been
observed in [44] where exclusion limits considering only ˜t via the process ˜t1 → ˜νRb(cid:96) have
been investigated in. Monolepton searches, mostly in combination with the requirement of

two tagged b-jets are also of signiﬁcance in cases where the above mentioned scenario either
competes with a ’standard’ decay ˜b1 → b ˜χ0
1/2 → bν ˜νR, or the process ˜t1 → tν ˜νR is the
dominant decay channel for the ˜t1, such one arrives at the well known t + /ET signal.

There are also scenarios where purely hadronic searches are important. From these
especially atlas 1308 2631, where a search for ˜t, ˜b via 2b + /ET is presented, is important as
it covers the case of ˜b → bν ˜νR and exploits the presence of tagable b-jets in the corresponding
ﬁnal states. Note, however, that this analysis relies on requirements of very hard jets, where

the leading jet is required to have pT > 150 GeV, and large missing energy. Here one has

potentially only a small acceptance in cases with moderate or small mass diﬀerences. This is

especially pronounced in its signal region B, that focusses on small mass diﬀerences between

third-generation squark and LSP with the trade-oﬀ to need hard ISR or FSR. As we only

simulate the tree-level process without hard initial state radiation (ISR) and/or ﬁnal state

radiation (FSR) we often do not meet the requirements of this signal region. However, we

take the resulting uncertainty into account in the interpretation of the CheckMATE result.

We follow ref. [39] in the categorization of the CheckMATE results: we deﬁne every point as

obs < 2

3, as ‘strictly excluded’ if rc

obs > 1.5 and ‘inconclusive’ or

either ‘strictly allowed’ if rc
‘ambiguous” in case of 2

3 < rc

obs < 1.5. This aids in keeping our statements less dependent

on statistical ﬂuctuations and thus more conservative. Moreover, we do not expect that

the inclusion of higher order corrections will change the r value such, that it switches from

‘strictly allowed’ to ‘strictly excluded’ or vice versa. Our procedure of labelling a parameter

space combination as ‘strictly excluded’ diﬀers slightly from the CheckMATE procedure: While

CheckMATE takes the rc

obs value of the largest rc

exp to ﬁnd its exclusion statement, we also

check all other analyses with rc

exp > 1.0 for rc

obs > 1.5. If there is at least one analysis that

excludes this parameter point, we take it as strictly excluded. If there is no such analysis,

we take the statement given by CheckMATE.

We have chosen a regular grid in the parameter space instead of performing a random

scan to get a better understanding of the diﬀerent features and potential pitfalls when

interpreting the results. The grid is given by combining the following parameters for the

values given:

11

• m˜t1 in GeV: 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000

• m˜b1 in GeV: 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000

• m˜νR in GeV : 60, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500

• µ in GeV: 110, 190, 290, 390, 490, 590 and require m˜νR < µ

• tan β: 10, 50
• θ˜t: 0◦, 45◦, 90◦
• θ˜b: 0◦, 45◦, 90◦
• M1 = M2 = 1 TeV
• everything else, including ˜t2,˜b2 and m˜g: 2 TeV

The exception is potentially m˜b2 when eq. (2.4) becomes eﬀective as mentioned above.

IV. RESULTS

probe the ﬁnal state resulting from the pair production of charginos and their decays:

dilepton channel. However the related process in eq. (2.11) is much more challenging, as

it would manifest itself only in a monojet signature [109]. It has been shown in [75] that

existing LHC data does not restrict the values for µ considered here from mono-jet searches

and, thus, our ﬁndings are not aﬀected by the fact that we do not take ISR into account

here.

From the relevant searches, atlas conf 2013 049 [101] and atlas 1403 5294 [31], the

latter is more important than the ﬁrst one as already noted in [54]. The reason is that
the decay kinematics of ˜(cid:96)±
1 is essentially the same as in our case whereas those of
˜χ+
1W + show a substantial diﬀerence. The impact of these analyses on the parameter

In such scenarios it can happen that the calculated mass for ˜b2 is actually smaller than the
input value for ˜b1. If this happens we ﬂip the resulting mass hierarchy as we want to keep

the default m˜b1 < m˜b2. We denote those as ‘ﬂipped’ point/case and treat them separately
at the end of this section.

We start by presenting our ﬁndings for various parameter combinations in the m˜t1-m˜b1
and refer for more details to the coming ref. [110]. A short summary explaining the entries

of the plots in Figs. 4–8 is given in Fig. 3. At every point in the m˜t1-m˜b1 we display all
considered combinations of mixing angles in the stop and sbottom sector by slightly shifting

the result depending on the respective mixing angle: The right column represents scenarios
with a right stop and a right sbottom, i.e. ˜t1 = ˜tR. The middle column belongs to a

i.e. θ˜t = 0. In the scenarios of this column we use the tree-level relation (2.4) as discussed

above. Note, that even if no ﬂipping of the sbottom masses takes place, one might have

additional signals coming from the production of the heavier sbottom. The diﬀerent rows

belong to diﬀerent mixing angles in the sbottom sector: The top one corresponds to θ˜b = 0,
the middle one to θ˜b = 45◦ and the lowest one to θ˜b = 90◦.

changed. We comment on the ﬂipped sbottom mass scenarios at the end of this section as

they hardly lead to new features. Figure 4 shows the case with a rather hierarchical mass

spectrum. As a result the ﬁnal states contain several hard leptons implying the stop and

sbottom masses below about 500 GeV can be excluded. For larger values the cross sections

get so much reduced that one would have to take higher order corrections into account.

Moreover, these cases would have required more detailed experimental investigations as the
experimental cuts are most likely not optimized for these cases. In case that both, ˜b1 and
˜t1, have masses above about 800 GeV, the production cross section gets too small and, thus,

these scenarios are strictly allowed. Comparing the two values of tan β we ﬁnd only a small

eﬀect: the bounds are somewhat softer for large tan β due to the smaller number of produced

top-quarks. Note, the composition of the lepton ﬂavours does not depend on tan β here as

we have a pure right-handed sneutrino. In case that also the left-handed sneutrino mass

parameter gets smaller, we would expect a further reduction of the bounds as the number of

τ -leptons would increase with a simultaneous reduction of electrons and muons in the ﬁnal

state.

In Figure 5 we show a scenario with a small mass diﬀerence m ˜χ± − m˜νR = 10 GeV
leading to softer leptons. As a consequence the bounds on the stop and sbottom masses

get weakened by at least 100 GeV. A further reduction happens if also the mass diﬀerence

between the squarks and the sneutrino gets small because then also the resulting b-quarks

are too soft to be detected. An example is show in Fig. 6 where we have set µ = 290 GeV

and m˜νR = 200 GeV. In particular the sbottom searches in the b /ET become less important

because of the requirement that the jet has to have a pT of at least 150 GeV in the analysis

atlas 1308 2631 [30] which is not met in case of light sbottoms with a mass of 300-400 GeV.
The situation is diﬀerent for stops with such a mass as there the decay into b ˜χ+
1 → bl˜νR is

present and thus the lepton searches are eﬀective.

An increase in µ leads to a merger of the allowed region created by the compressed mass

spectrum with the high-masses allowed region, as can be seen in the trend going from Fig. 6

to Fig. 7. However the size of this allowed region is still dependent on the mass of ˜νR as

can be observed in a comparison of Fig. 7 and Fig. 8. In particular in the later case only

three-body decays of the squarks are possible if their masses are below 600 GeV resulting in

hard b-jets and leptons and thus to a larger excluded region in the m˜t1–m˜b1 plane compared
to the previous case.

In Figure 9 we summarize the exclusion statements in a condensed way. We put the

set (right column) to get a rough idea of the underlying uncertainty. The upper row gives

the cases with an unﬂipped sbottom mass spectrum. We see in plot a) that only the case

of m˜t1 = 300 GeV is strictly excluded if the ambiguous points are counted as allowed. The
corner with m˜b1 ≥ 700GeV and m˜t1 ≥ 800 GeV is not constrained at all which was expected
due to the small production cross section. The exclusion statement for all other points

is strongly dependent on the underlying parameter combinations as can be seen from the

discussion of the individual cases before. A comparison with the right column shows that

the range of excluded stop masses for all other parameter combinations gets somewhat larger

if the ambiguous points are counted as excluded indicating that this region deserves further

investigations. This also correct for some parameter combinations in the the higher stop and

sbottom mass region close to 800 GeV. A particular case is m˜t1 = m˜b1 = 600 GeV which
seems now to be excluded for all parameter combinations. However, this has to be taken
with a grain of salt as we have restricted µ ≤ 590 GeV and, thus, having always two-body
decays. We have also checked that this point is not excluded, which means having rc
obs values

below 2/3, for some parameter combinations if only three body decays of the squarks are

allowed by setting µ = 610 GeV for this particular case.

The lower row gives the cases where the sbottom mass ordering is ﬂipped. Here we

exclude right from the start all points where the sbottom is lighter than the sneutrino. We

see that these cases are consistent with the ﬁndings in the upper row. However, in addition

we have here a couple of points where the lighter sbottom has a mass below 300 GeV. It

is intriguing that in the rather low mass region the exclusion depends on the parameter

combinations in the conservative case (left side). The reason for this lies in the particular
mass hierarchies: in cases, where the decay ˜t1 → W +˜b1 is the only viable one due to a large
µ, the value of the sneutrino mass determines the pT and visibility of the exiting b quark

which helps to pass the particular analysis’ jet requirements in addition to the jets coming
from the W . Moreover, the mass splitting between ˜t1 and ˜b1 is rather small leaving little

phase space for the W -boson which in turn implies that the resulting jet energies hardly

pass the required pT -cuts.

A comparison of our exclusion with those ref. [44] shows that due the fact, that we do
not only consider cos θ˜t = 0, implying ˜t1 = ˜tR, but consider three diﬀerent values, we do
not reach their strict exclusions of m˜t1 up to 900 GeV. However, if for a pure ˜tR we do
not reach this value which is due to the diﬀerences between CheckMATE and PGS. Similarly,

18

we get lower bounds on the mass bounds of the chargino and sneutrinos from the direct
chargino production: we get roughly a bound of m ˜χ± ∼ 300 GeV and m˜νR ∼ 120 GeV
whereas in [44] the bounds m ˜χ± ∼ 550 GeV and m˜νR ∼ 300 GeV. The main diﬀerence is the
more conservative rc
obs-measure of CheckMATE given in eq. (3.1) whereas in PGS the measure
R = NN P
Nlimit

is used with NN P and Nlimit being the number of events from the new physics

and the experimental upper bound, respectively.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have studied a variant of the natural supersymmetric models containing

a right-handed sneutrino LSP as it can emerge as eﬀective model from models with extended

gauge groups. We have considered diﬀerent scenarios taking also into account the case that

at least one of the sbottoms gets light. The latter can in particular occur if the lighter stop

is essentially left-handed. Provided that the mass diﬀerence is not too small we ﬁnd that

only stop masses of up to about 300 GeV can be excluded in this scenario independent of its

nature. Depending on the scenario, where the main parameters are the stop mixing angles

and the ratio of stop mass to µ to sneutrino mass, one can exclude larger masses of up to
700 GeV. Here we roughly conﬁrm the ﬁndings of [44] where the case of a pure ˜tR had been

considered. In addition we obtain similar results for the sbottoms. Last but not least we

ﬁnd that the bounds are somewhat weaker in case of large tan β as the number of produced

t-quarks from the squark decays is smaller which in turn reduces the average number of hard

leptons in the ﬁnal state.
