Abstract

The c-map of four dimensional non-linear theories of electromagnetism is considered both in
the rigid case and in its coupling to gravity. In this way theories with antisymmetric tensors
and scalars are obtained, and the three non-linear representations of N=2 supersymmetry
partially broken to N=1 related. The manifest Sp(2n) and U(n) covariance of these theories
in their multiﬁeld extensions is also exhibited.

Introduction

In this paper we formulate the c-map for Born-Infeld-like theories [1] (for a review, see [2]),
i.e. for non-linear theories which generalize the canonical Born-Infeld (BI) electromagnetism
to multi-vector, tensor and scalar ﬁelds. As for ordinary supersymmetric theories, the c-
map is deﬁned [3], [4] both in the rigid and gravitational cases, by the uplifting of a formal
dimensional reduction of the four-dimensional theory on a circle to three dimensions [5].
Starting with a multi-vector generalization of the BI theory, the resulting three-dimensional
model, obtained upon dimensional reduction and dualization of the vectors to scalar ﬁelds, is
a non-linear model describing scalar ﬁelds only. This model provides a consistent non-linear
theory for scalar ﬁelds in four dimensions, which in turn can be Legendre-transformed into
a non-linear theory of antisymmetric rank-2 tensor ﬁelds.

This is most easily accomplished using the linear description of BI theories, in which
the Lagrangian is made quadratic in the vector ﬁeld-strengths by adding suitable Lagrange
multipliers in the form of non-dynamical scalar ﬁelds [6, 8].
Integrating out these extra
ﬁelds through their equations of motion, one obtains the BI action (or one of its multiﬁeld
generalizations). One of the advantages of this formulation is that it makes the global
symmetries of the BI theory manifest. Moreover it is the most convenient formulation in
which to derive the BI-like theories from supersymmetric ones.

For the case of a single vector ﬁeld, the three alternative formulations displayed in this
paper, namely the scalar-scalar, scalar-tensor, tensor-tensor theories [9],[10] are in fact re-
lated to diﬀerent non-linear representations of the N = 2 superalgebra spontaneously broken
to N = 1. While in the Born-Infeld case the goldstino multiplet is a N = 1 vector multiplet
[11], in the scalar-tensor theory it is a N = 1 real linear multiplet [12] and in the scalar-
scalar case it is a N = 1 chiral multiplet [12]. The two latter theories correspond to D3
brane actions in ﬁve and six dimensions [12].

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we recall the basics of the c-map [3, 4]
relating special and quaternionic (Hyper-K¨ahler) geometries in N = 2 local (rigid) theories.
In section 3 we recall the main ingredients for the “linear realization” of BI-like theories,
as developed in [8]. In section 4 we derive the c-map of the Born-Infeld theory coupled to
gravity, which reproduces the bosonic part of the non-linear chiral multiplet action of [10, 12].
In section 5 it is shown how all non-linear theories discussed in [11, 12] are reproduced using
the c-map operation and Legendre transforms. In particular this implies that such theories
have a supersymmetric completion. The paper ends with some concluding remarks.

2 Local and rigid c-map

Let us recall, in this section, the formal steps to get the c-map of the Lagrangian describing
N = 2 vector multiplets both in the supergravity and rigid-supersymmetry cases.

Local c-map. Let us start from an N = 2 supergravity model of vector multiplets in four

where µ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3, the index Λ enumerates the vector ﬁelds and F Λ
µ . If the
theory is invariant under axial rotations, we can formally perform a dimensional reduction,
along the isometry direction, to three dimensions on a background with metric:

µν = ∂µAΛ

ν −∂νAΛ

ds2 = e−2U gˆµˆν dxˆµdxˆν − e2U (dx3 + A(3))2 ,

(2.2)

where ˆµ, ˆν = 0, 1, 2 and gˆµˆν = gˆµˆν(xˆρ), A(3) = A(3)
ˆµ (xˆν)dxˆµ are the D = 3 metric and
Kaluza-Klein vector [5]. The vectors in D = 4 reduce to three dimensional ones as follows:

AΛ = ˆAΛ

ˆµ (xˆν) dxˆµ + ζ Λ(xˆν) V 3 , V 3 = dx3 + ˆA(3) .

(2.3)

where V 3 is proportional to the vielbein in the isometry direction and we have set AΛ
The corresponding ﬁeld strengths read:

3 = ζ Λ.

F Λ = ˆF Λ + F Λ

3 V 3 , where ˆF Λ = d ˆAΛ + ζ Λ ˆF (3) ,

ˆF (3) = dA(3) .

(2.4)

Next we consider the D = 3 Lagrangian which is given by the four dimensional one written
in terms of three dimensional ﬁelds, plus a Chern-Simons term inducing the dualization of
the D = 3 vector ﬁelds A(3), ˆAΛ to scalar degrees of freedom a, ˜ζΛ:

sponding to U, a and, say, ζ 0, ˜ζ0) being the universal hypermultiplet containing the degrees

which close a characteristic Heisenberg algebra [4]. However, since hypermultiplets couple
in the same way both to D = 3 and to D = 4 supergravity, it can be promoted to a D = 4
Lagrangian describing the coupling of n + 1 hypermultiplets to D = 4 supergravity, by just
extending the range of indices to 0, . . . , 3. The related scalar geometry is of quaternionic
K¨ahler type [13, 14].

describes an Hyper-K¨ahler sigma-model of a restricted type [15, 3].

3 Linear description of Born-Infeld Theories

In this section we brieﬂy recall the linear description of BI theories in terms of auxiliary ﬁelds,
introduced in [6, 7, 8]. This description does not rely on supersymmetry although, for special
choices of the scalar sector and of the parameters, it can be embedded in a supersymmetric
theory. As extensively discussed in [8], the four-dimensional Lagrangian generalizing BI to
n vector ﬁelds can be put in the form (up to an additive constant):

L = −1

(3.1)
where N is a constant 2n × 2n symmetric matrix, g and θ are n × n symmetric matrices
function of a set of ns scalar ﬁelds φs, λ is a parameter which should be taken small to obtain
a well-deﬁned non-linear description.

The non-dynamical scalar sector can be integrated out through its algebraic equations of

motion can be cast in the following manifestly symplectic-covariant form:

The eﬀective symmetry preserved by the non-linear Lagrangian depends on both the sym-
metry of the scalar sector and the invariance of the matrix N . Suppose the scalar ﬁelds
span a homogeneous symmetric space of the form G/H, and that the matrix M(φ) deﬁnes
a mapping between this manifold and Sp(2n)/U(n):

{φs} ∈ G
H

−→ M(φ) ∈ Sp(2n)

Any isometry generator of G, described by a Killing vector kα, corresponds to a symplectic
matrix (tα)M

N , so that

δM = αks

The on-shell global invariance of the non-linear theory is described by the generators tα of
G further satisfying the following conditions:

These conditions deﬁne the group G(cid:84) Inv(N ) [8], where Inv(N ) ⊂ Sp(2n) is the invariance

follows, Inv(N ) = U(n) and the global symmetry of the non-linear theory is the maximal
compact subgroup H of G. Using the twisted self-duality condition, the ﬁrst of (3.6) can be
cast in the form:

µνtαC∗Fµν = 0 .
FT

(3.7)

These reproduce, in a symplectic invariant way, the conditions ﬁrst found in [1].

In the following we shall consider the case G = Sp(2n), H = U(n) and N M N = δM N . We
postpone to a future work the study of non-linear theories with a smaller on-shell symmetry
group, obtained by considering the non-dynamical scalar ﬁelds in a smaller coset G/H.

As discussed above, we can again consider the dimensional reduction from 4 to 3 dimensions
of the gauge ﬁeld strength (in the case ∂3Aµ = 0). When decomposing µ → ˆµ, 3, the kinetic
and topological terms of (5.1) reduce respectively to:

X → FˆµˆνF ˆµˆν − 2∂ˆµζ∂ ˆµζ

However, the same terms (5.4), (5.5) would be obtained in the dimensional reduction of the
four dimensional Lagrangian for a real scalar ζ plus an antisymmetric tensor ﬁeld Hµνρ =

5.2 The multi-scalar Born-Infeld Lagrangian

In the spirit of the procedure of [8], outlined in section 3, the problem of determining the
U(n)-duality invariant multi-scalar BI action is that of minimizing the linearized Lagrangian

Llin.−scalar =

Variational derivation. We try to retrieve the result (5.12) using the Lagrangian method
of minimization of a function in the presence of constraints among the variables.
In our case the variables are the matrix elements of M and the constraints it obeys are

the propriety to be a symmetric and symplectic matrix, namely

ϕ2 ≡ MT − M = 0 ,
ϕ1 ≡ MT CM − C = 0 .

(5.13)
(5.14)

The above mentioned method amounts to minimizing a linear combination of the Lagrangian
(5.10) together with the two constraints ϕ1 and ϕ2, namely

while λ1 and λ2 are two Lagrangian multipliers implementing the constraints (5.13),(5.14),
which are antisymmetric matrices since so are the left-hand-side of equations (5.13) and
(5.14). We obtain from (5.15) in matrix notation:

− P + CM λ1 + λ2 = 0.

(5.16)

Let us try to solve the constrained equation setting λ2 = 0; it follows

(5.17)
In order to ﬁnd the explicit expression of M, we have still to compute λ1. This is done setting
together the above result with the two constraint equations (5.13) and (5.14). Equation
(5.13) inserted in (5.17) gives

λi(B) denoting the eigenvalues of B. If we denote by BD the diagonalized B and ˜A the form
of A in the basis in which B is diagonal, we can write the following inequalities:

B2 = 12n ⇒ |λi(B)| = 1 ,

λi(B) ˜Aii| ≤(cid:88)
|Tr(AB)| = |Tr( ˜ABD)| = |(cid:88)

We therefore ﬁnd that (as above, the ﬁnal sign assignment is chosen such that M be positive

(cid:16)√−PCPC(cid:17) ⇒ Tr(AB) = Tr(PCM−1C) ≥ −Tr

5.3 Coupling to gravity

Just as we did in the two-scalar case, we can write the multiscalar non-linear Lagrangian
coupled to gravity. It is

ˆe−1L4 = − ˆR

(5.36)
where Ln.lin.−scalar is given by (5.34), with ηµν replaced by the space-time metric gµν. This
action describes the c-map of n-vector BI action.

5.4 Dualizing scalars into tensors

In the absence of gravity, the non-linear scalar Lagrangian (5.12) exhibits shift symmetries
associated with the 2n scalars Z M . This is also apparent in the linearized form of the
Lagrangian (5.10). This allows us to dualize all the scalars into tensor ﬁelds. To this end it
is convenient to work with (5.10) and to write:

L(cid:48) =

µMηµ − 1

− HT

µ (ηµ − ∂µZ) ,

(5.37)

where we have suppressed the symplectic indices and Hµ ≡ (HM µ), ηµ ≡ (ηM
µ ). Upon
variation of L(cid:48) with respect to Hµ we get back (5.10), while by varying L(cid:48) with respect to
Z M we ﬁnd the condition ∂µHM µ = 0 which implies that, locally,

HM µ ≡ 1
3!

µνρσ H νρσ

M , where HM µνρ = 3∂[µBM νρ] .

(5.38)

The equations obtained by varying L(cid:48) with respect to ηM

µ are:
Mηµ = Hµ ⇒ ηµ = M−1Hµ .

Replacing the solution to the above equation in L(cid:48), up to total derivatives we ﬁnd:

where now the 2n × 2n matrix ˆP M N is deﬁned as follows:

(5.39)

(5.40)

(5.41)
The non-linear theory is obtained by minimizing the action with respect to the matrix M.
This can be done along the same lines as in Sect. 5.2, thus obtaining:

which is manifestly U(n)-invariant. For n = 1 the above Lagrangian reduces to Eq. (5.9).

Conclusions

In this investigation we considered the c-map of non linear theories of vectors ﬁelds and
their c-map counterparts. In doing so multi-ﬁelds non linear scalar and tensor theories are
obtained of the type considered in [9, 10]. The c-map can be extended by coupling these non
linear theories to gravity then obtaining a deformation of Quaternionic-K¨ahler manifolds of
N=2 theories.
It would be interesting to discuss the supersymmetric extensions of these
theories, at least for the N = 1, 2 cases. In order to achieve this a non linear constraint
preserving the lower supersymmetry should be found.
