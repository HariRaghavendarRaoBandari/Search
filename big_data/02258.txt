Abstract

In this paper we propose the ﬁrst estimate of some elastic parameters of the relaxed micromorphic
model on the basis of real experiments of transmission of longitudinal plane waves across an interface sep-
arating a classical Cauchy material (steel plate) and a phononic crystal (steel plate with ﬂuid-ﬁlled holes).
A procedure is set up in order to identify the parameters of our model by superimposing the experimental
proﬁle of the reﬂection coeﬃcient (plotted as function of the frequency of the traveling waves) with the
analogous proﬁle obtained via simulations based upon the relaxed micromorphic model. We end up with
the determination of 5 out of 6 constitutive parameters which are featured by the relaxed micromorphic
model in the isotropic case, plus the determination of the micro-inertia parameter. The sixth elastic
parameter, namely the Cosserat couple modulus µc, still remains undetermined, since experimental data
concerning the transmission properties of the considered interface for transverse incident waves are not
yet available. A fundamental result of the present paper is the estimate of the non-locality intrinsically
associated to the underlying microstructure of the metamaterial. As a matter of fact, we appraise that
the characteristic length Lc measuring the non-locality of the considered phononic crystal is of the order
of 1/3 of the diameter of the considered ﬂuid-ﬁlled holes.

Introduction

1
Mechanical band-gap metamaterials are suitably engineered microstructured materials which are able to in-
hibit elastic wave propagation in speciﬁc frequency ranges due to the presence of their underlying microstruc-
ture. These frequency intervals at which wave inhibition takes place are known as frequency band-gaps and
their intrinsic characteristics (characteristic values of the gap frequency, extension of the band-gap, etc.)
strongly depend on the metamaterial microstructure. Such unorthodox dynamical behavior can be related
to two main physical phenomena occurring at the micro-level:

• local resonance phenomena (Mie resonance): the micro-structural components, excited at particular
frequencies, start oscillating independently of the matrix thus capturing the energy of the propagating
wave which remains conﬁned at the level of the microstructure. Macroscopic wave propagation thus
results to be inhibited,

• micro-diﬀusion phenomena (Bragg scattering): when the propagating wave has wavelengths which are
small enough to start interacting with the microstructure of the material, reﬂection and transmission
phenomena occur at the micro-level that globally result in an inhibited macroscopic wave propagation.

Such resonance and micro-diﬀusion mechanisms (usually a mix of the two) are at the basis of both electromag-
netic and elastic band-gaps (see e.g. [2, 11] and they are manifestly related to the particular microstructural
topologies of the considered metamaterials.
In fact, it is well known (see e.g. [2, 10, 16, 24, 26]) that the
characteristics of the microstructures strongly inﬂuence the macroscopic band-gap behavior.

In recent works [13, 14] we proposed a new generalized continuum model, which we called relaxed micro-
morphic which is able to account for the onset of microstructure-related frequency band-gaps [13, 14] while
remaining in the macroscopic framework of continuum mechanics. Well posedness results have already been
proved for this model [9,19]. On the basis of the results obtained in our previous works, we can claim that the
relaxed micromorphic model is the only macroscopic continuum model known to date which is simultaneously
able to account for

• prediction of complete band-gaps in mechanical metamaterials
• non-local eﬀects (via the introduction of higher order derivatives of the micro distortion tensor in the

strain energy density).

In [15] we presented a comprehensive study of jump conditions that can be imposed at surfaces of discontinuity
of the material properties in relaxed micromorphic media, so establishing a strong basis for the systematic
study of reﬂection and transmission phenomena in real band-gap metamaterials. In this paper, we will show
that the particular constraint introduced in [15] that we called “macro internal clamp with free microstructure”
is indeed able to reproduce real situations in which a Cauchy material (e.g. steel) is connected to a phononic
crystal (e.g. a steel plate with ﬂuid-ﬁlled holes). To give a more technologically oriented taste to our
investigations, we consider here the experimental investigations presented in [11] in which transmission of
longitudinal plane waves at an interface between a steel plate and a phononic crystal is studied. The two
main aims of the present paper can be identiﬁed as follows:

• determine, by inverse approach, the maximum possible number of constitutive elastic parameters fea-
tured by the relaxed micromorphic model in the isotropic case by direct comparison with the experi-
mental results proposed in [11],

• give a ﬁrst evidence of non-local eﬀects in band-gap metamaterials, by quantifying them through the
determination of the characteristic length Lc for the phononic crystal experimentally studied in [11].

The present paper is organized according to the following structure
• In section 2 we brieﬂy recall the bulk governing equations and the associated boundary conditions that
have to be used for modeling the mechanical behavior of Cauchy continua and of relaxed micromorphic
media [9, 13, 14, 19]. The hypothesis of plane wave is introduced and a short discussion concerning the
behavior of the dispersion relations obtained by means of our relaxed micromorphic model is performed.

3

No redundant details about the explicit derivation of such dispersion relations are given, for this the
reader is referred to [15]. It is nonetheless explicitly pointed out that the relaxed micromorphic model
simultaneously allows to describe the onset of band-gaps in mechanical metamaterials together with
the possibility of non-local eﬀects.

• In section 3 we recall some results rigorously derived in [15] concerning the conservation of total energy
in relaxed micromorphic media. The explicit form of the energy ﬂuxes is presented both in the general
case and using the plane wave ansatz. For completeness, the conservation of total energy is recalled
also for classical Cauchy continua.

• In section 4 a particular connection between a Cauchy medium and a relaxed micromorphic medium is
introduced on the basis of the results proposed in [15]. This connection has been called “macro internal
clamp with free microstructure” and allows continuity of macroscopic displacement at the considered
interface together with free motions of the microstructure on the side of the interface occupied by the
relaxed micromorphic medium. Plane wave solutions are presented for the displacement in the Cauchy
side and for the displacement and the micro-distortion in the relaxed micromorphic side. The unknown
amplitudes of the reﬂected and transmitted waves are calculated by imposing the constraint of “macro
internal clamp with free microstructure” at the Cauchy/relaxed micromorphic interface. The presented
general study is particularized to the case in which only longitudinal waves travel in the considered
materials.

• In section 5 reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients at a Cauchy/relaxed-micromorphic interface are
deﬁned: they measure the percentage of the energy initially carried by the incident wave which is
reﬂected or transmitted at the interface. The particular degenerate limit case of the relaxed micromor-
phic model which is obtained by setting Lc = 0 is then introduced and some characteristic frequencies
which allow to determine the bounds of the band-gaps for longitudinal waves are deﬁned as functions
of the constitutive elastic parameters of the model. Such degenerate limit case, often referred to as
internal variable model can be used as a ﬁrst rough ﬁtting of the relaxed micromorphic model on real
experimental data but it is not able to account for non-local eﬀects. Indeed, internal variable models
are able to catch the main macroscopic features of band-gap metamaterials [23, 25]. It is then argued
that the fact of switching on the parameter Lc would actually allow to perform a more reﬁned ﬁtting
on the experimental proﬁles of the reﬂection coeﬃcient.

• In section 6 the proﬁle of the reﬂection coeﬃcient as obtained by using our relaxed micromorphic model
with Lc = 0 is compared to the analogous experimental proﬁle presented in [11]. As a result of this
direct comparison with experimental results, four conditions on the elastic parameters are established
which allow for the determination of four constitutive parameters as function of the ﬁfth which remains
free and is calibrated in order to obtain the best ﬁtting with the experimental proﬁle of the reﬂection
coeﬃcient. Finally, the characteristic length Lc is switched on and it is tuned to perform a more reﬁned
ﬁtting until the theoretical proﬁle of the reﬂection coeﬃcient is more precisely superimposed to the
experimental one. The estimated value of non-local eﬀects is found to be Lc (cid:39) 0.5 mm, which means
that such characteristic length is almost 1/3 of the diameter of the holes embedded in the considered
metamaterial. Such non-local eﬀects, which are already non-negligible, would become more and more
important if considering higher contrasts of the mechanical properties at the microscopic level. This
situation could be e.g. achieved by ﬁlling adjacent holes with ﬂuids with highly contrasted properties.
Only one elastic parameter, namely the Cosserat couple modulus µc remains undetermined at the end
of the present work. In order to estimate its value (which we know to be non-vanishing for a material
showing complete band-gaps [12–14]) for the phononic crystal considered here, we would need to extend
our study for longitudinal waves to the case of transverse waves. A complete determination of the whole
set of constitutive coeﬃcients for the relaxed micromorphic model is left to a forthcoming contribution.

2 Dynamic formulation of the equilibrium problem
In the micromorphic model, the kinematics is enriched with respect to classical Cauchy continua by intro-
ducing an additional tensor ﬁeld of non-symmetric micro-distortions P : Ω ⊂ R3 → R3×3, beyond

4

the classical macroscopic displacement u : Ω ⊂ R3 → R3. Then, a non-symmetric elastic (relative)
distortion e = ∇u − P can be deﬁned and the modeling proceeds by obtaining the constitutive relations
linking elastic-distortions to stresses and by postulating a balance equation for the micro-distortion ﬁeld P .
All such steps can be preferably done in a variational framework such that only energy contributions need
to be deﬁned a priori. For the dynamic case, one adds in the kinetic energy density so-called micro-inertia
density contributions, acting on the time derivatives P,t of the micro-distortion terms.

2.1 The classical Cauchy medium
In this subsection we recall that the strain energy density W and the kinetic energy T for a classical Cauchy
medium in the isotropic setting take the form6

W = µ(cid:107) sym ∇u (cid:107)2 +

(tr (sym ∇u ))2 ,

T =

ρ(cid:107)u,t(cid:107)2 ,

where λ and µ are the classical Lamé parameters and u denotes the classical macroscopic displacement ﬁeld.
The associated bulk equations of motion in strong form, obtained by a classical least action principle,

take the usual form:

ρ u,tt = Div σ,

f : = σ · n = 0

or

u = u0,

∀x ∈ Ω,
∀x ∈ ∂Ω,

where n is the normal to the boundary ∂Ω, and σ is the symmetric elastic stress tensor deﬁned as:

σ (∇u ) = 2 µ sym ∇u + λ tr(∇u )1 .

(2)

(3)

Considering the case of plane waves, we suppose that the space dependence of all introduced kinematic
ﬁelds are limited to the component x1 of x which is the direction of propagation of the wave. With this
hypothesis, see [15], the equations of motion (2)1 become

Considering a wave traveling in an inﬁnite domain no conditions on the boundary are to be imposed and,
replacing the wave form expression (5) in the bulk equation (2), we can ﬁnd the standard dispersion relations

dispersion relations can be traced in the plane (ω, k), giving rise to the standard non-dispersive behavior for
a classical Cauchy continuum (see [1,6–8,15]). Indeed it is easily seen that for Cauchy continua the relations

2.2 The relaxed micromorphic model
Our novel relaxed micromorphic model endows Mindlin-Eringen’s representation with the second order dis-
location density tensor α = − CurlP instead of the full gradient ∇P .7 In the isotropic case the energy
reads

where the parameters and the elastic stress are analogous to the standard Mindlin-Eringen micromorphic
model. The model is well-posed in the statical and dynamical case including when µc = 0, see [9, 18].

In our relaxed model the complexity of the general micromorphic model has been decisively reduced
featuring basically only symmetric strain-like variables and the Curl of the micro-distortion P . However, the
relaxed model is still general enough to include the full micro-stretch as well as the full Cosserat micro-polar
model, see [19]. Furthermore, well-posedness results for the statical and dynamical cases have been provided
in [19] making decisive use of recently established new coercive inequalities, generalizing Korn’s inequality to
incompatible tensor ﬁelds [4, 5, 17, 20–22].

The relaxed micromorphic model counts 6 constitutive parameters in the isotropic case (µe, λe, µmicro,
λmicro, µc, Lc). The characteristic length Lc is intrinsically related to non-local eﬀects due to the fact that it
weights a suitable combination of ﬁrst order space derivatives in the strain energy density (9). For a general
presentation of the features of the relaxed micromorphic model in the anisotropic setting, we refer to [3].

As for the kinetic energy, we consider that it takes the following form

T =

ρ(cid:107)u,t(cid:107)2 +

1
2

η (cid:107)P,t(cid:107)2 ,

(10)

where ρ is the value of the averaged macroscopic mass density of the considered metamaterial, while η is the
micro-inertia density. In the following numerical simulations we will suppose that the macroscopic density
ρ is known, while we will deduce the micro-inertia parameter η by an inverse approach. In any case, we
have checked that the value of ρ does not inﬂuence the proﬁle of the reﬂection coeﬃcient, at least for the
considered range of frequencies.

Deﬁning the elastic stress(cid:101)σ, the hyper-stress tensor m, the micro-stress s as:

(cid:101)σ (∇u , P ) = 2 µe sym (∇u − P ) + 2 µc skew (∇u − P ) + λe tr (∇u − P ) 1 ,

(11)

m ( Curl P ) = µeL2

c Curl P,

s(P ) = [2µmicro sym P + λmicro tr(P )1] ,

the associated equations of motion in strong form, obtained by a classical least action principle take the form
(see [13–15, 18])

ρ u,tt = Div(cid:101)σ,
η P,tt =(cid:101)σ − s − Curl m,

∀x ∈ Ω,
∀x ∈ Ω,

(12)

(13)

while the associated natural and kinematical boundary condition are:

t : =(cid:101)σ · n = 0

τ : = m ·  · n = 0

or

or

u = u0,
P · ν1 = p1, P · ν2 = p2,

∀x ∈ ∂Ω,
∀x ∈ ∂Ω,

where n and νi (i = 1, 2) are the normal and tangent vectors to the boundary ∂Ω, while t and τ are the
resulting internal force and double force vectors.

7The dislocation tensor is deﬁned as αij = − ( CurlP )ij = −Pih,kjkh, where  is the Levi-Civita tensor.

6

Our approach consists always in projecting the found relations in the three orthogonal sub vector spaces
Sym (3) ∩ sl (3) , so (3) ,(cid:104) 1(cid:105). In this way the micro-distortion tensor P ∈ R3×3 is uniquely written by means
of its Cartan-Lie decomposition as P = dev sym (P ) + skew (P ) + 1

3 tr (P ) 1. Therefore, deﬁning

P[ij] := ( skewP )ij =

P(ij) := ( sym P )ij =

we have:

Furthermore, we deﬁne

Pij = P D

(ij) + P[ij] + P Sδij = P(ij) + P[ij].

P D := P D

(11) = P(11) − P S,

P V := P(22) − P(33) = P22 − P33.

Since it will be useful in the following, let us collect some of the new variables of our problem as

v1 :=(cid:0)u1, P D, P S(cid:1) ,

v2 :=(cid:0)u2, P(12), P[12]

(cid:1) ,

v3 :=(cid:0)u3, P(13), P[13]

(cid:1) ,

and, for having a homogeneous notation, let us set

v4 := P(23),

v5 := P[23],

v6 := P V .

with these new variables the equations of motion (12) can be written as (see also [15]):

As done for the Cauchy continuum, we consider the case of plane waves, by looking for solutions of the

dynamic problem in the form
v1 = β1 ei(kx1−ω t),
v4 = β4 ei(kx1−ω t),

v2 = β2 ei(kx1−ω t),
v5 = β5 ei(kx1−ω t),

v3 = β3 ei(kx1−ω t),
v6 = β6 ei(kx1−ω t).

where β1, β2, β3 ∈ R3 and β4, β5, β6 ∈ R. Replacing this wave-form in equations (19) the dispersion relations
for the relaxed micromorphic medium can be obtained (see [15] for details).

It is clear that the study of dispersion relations for the relaxed micromorphic continuum is intrinsically
more complicated than in the case of classical Cauchy continuum due to its enriched kinematics.
In the
papers [13–15] it was explicitly pointed out that the wave-numbers for uncoupled waves in the relaxed
micromorphic continua can be calculated as function of the frequency ω as:

These relationships can be eventually easily inversed to ﬁnd ω as function of k.

As far as longitudinal and transverse waves are concerned, the expressions for the wave-numbers k which
allow for non-trivial solutions are by far more complicated. We refer to [15] for the complete set-up of the
eigenvalue problems which must be solved to ﬁnd the explicit expressions for the wave-numbers, limiting
ourselves here to denote them by ±k1

The relaxed micromorphic model is the only generalized continuum model (see [12, 15]) which is able to

simultaneously account for:

• complete frequency band-gaps
• non-local eﬀects involving interactions between adjacent unit cells.

Non locality is an intrinsic feature of metamaterials with heterogeneous microstructure and it is sensible that
it plays a non-negligible role on the phenomena of wave propagation, reﬂection and transmission. We will
show in the remainder of this paper, based on real experiments, that the characteristic length associated to
such non-local eﬀects may be an order of magnitude comparable with the characteristic size of the underlying
microstructure, even if considering otherwise homogeneous metamaterials.

Indeed, when considering metamaterials with heterogeneous microstructures (e.g. metamaterials in which
two adjacent unitary cells have strongly contrasted mechanical properties) the non-local eﬀects may play a
more and more important role on the overall behavior of the considered metamaterial.

3 Conservation of the total energy
It is known that if one considers conservative mechanical systems, like in the present paper, then conservation
of total energy must be veriﬁed in the form

dE
dt

+ div H = 0,

(24)

where E = T + W is the total energy of the considered system and H is the energy ﬂux vector. It is clear
that the explicit expressions for the total energy and for the energy ﬂux are diﬀerent depending on whether
one considers a classical Cauchy model or a relaxed micromorphic one. If the expression of the total energy
E is straightforward for the two mentioned cases (it suﬃces to look at the given expressions of T and W ),
the explicit expression of the energy ﬂux H is more complicated to be obtained. The explicit expression of
the energy ﬂuxes for the Cauchy and relaxed micromorphic media have been deduced in [15], to which we
refer for additional details on this subject.

3.1 The classical Cauchy medium
In classical Cauchy continua the energy ﬂux vector H can be written as

H = −σ · u,t,

(25)

where the symmetric Cauchy stress tensor σ has been deﬁned in equation (3) in terms of the displacement
ﬁeld. The ﬁrst component of the energy ﬂux vector given in equation (25), simpliﬁes in the 1D case into

H1 = − ˙u1 [(λ + 2µ) u1,1] − ˙u2 [µ u2,1] − ˙u3 [µ u3,1] .

(26)

3.2 The relaxed micromorphic continuum
In relaxed micromorphic media, the energy ﬂux vector H is deﬁned as (see [15])

H = −(cid:101)σT · u,t − (mT · Pt) : ,

where the stress tensor (cid:101)σ and the hyper-stress tensor m have been deﬁned in equation (11) in terms of the

(27)

basic kinematical ﬁelds and  is the Levi-Civita tensor.

When considering conservation of total energy, it can be checked that the ﬁrst component of the energy

ﬂux (27) can be rewritten in terms of the new variables as

Interface jump conditions at a Cauchy/relaxed-micromorphic in-
terface

In this section we present a possible choice of boundary conditions to be imposed between a Cauchy medium
and a relaxed micromorphic medium. Such set of boundary conditions has been derived in [15] and allows to
describe free vibrations of the microstructure at the considered interface. We will show in the remainder of
this paper how this particular choice of the boundary conditions is capable to describe phenomena of wave
transmission in real mechanical metamaterials. For the full presentation of the complete sets of possible
connections that can be established at Cauchy/relaxed, relaxed/relaxed, Cauchy/Mindlin, Mindlin/Mindlin
interfaces we refer to [15].

When considering connections between a Cauchy and a relaxed micromorphic medium one can impose
more kinematical boundary conditions than in the case of connections between Cauchy continua. More
precisely, one can act on the displacement ﬁeld u (on both sides of the interface) and also on the tangential
micro-distortion P (on the side of the interface occupied by the relaxed micromorphic continuum). In what
follows, we consider the “-” region occupied by the Cauchy continuum and the “+” region occupied by the
micromorphic continuum, so that, accordingly, we use the following notations:

f = σ− · n−,

t =(cid:101)σ+ · n+,

τ = µeL2

c ( Curl P +) ·  · n+.

(30)

It is possible to check that considering the normal n = (1, 0, 0), the normal components τ11, τ21 and τ31 of
the double force are identically zero. Therefore, the number of independent conditions that one can impose
on the micro-distortions is 6 when considering a relaxed micromorphic model.

In this paper we focus our attention on one particular type of connection between a classical Cauchy
continuum and a relaxed micromorphic one, which is sensible to reproduce the real situation in which the
microstructure of the band-gap metamaterial is free to vibrate independently of the macroscopic matrix.
Such particular connection guarantees continuity of the macroscopic displacement and free motion of the
microstructure (which means vanishing double force) at the interface:

[[u]] = 0,

t − f = 0,

τ · ν1 = τ · ν2 = 0.

(31)

We explicitly remark that continuity of displacement implies continuity of the internal forces and that the
conditions on the arbitrariness of micro-motions is assured by imposing that the tangent part of the double
force is vanishing.

4.1 Reﬂection and transmission of plane waves at a Cauchy/relaxed-micromorphic

interface

When studying the reﬂection and transmission of a plane wave at a Cauchy/relaxed-micromorphic interface,
we are considering that an incident wave traveling in the Cauchy medium impacts the interface. Two waves
are than generated, namely one wave reﬂected in the Cauchy medium and one transmitted in the relaxed
micromorphic medium. We explicitly remark that the reﬂected wave contains the longitudinal and transverse
parts of the displacement ﬁeld, while the transmitted wave contains a longitudinal part on the ﬁeld v1, two
transverse parts on vα (α = 2, 3) and the three uncoupled ﬁelds v4, v5 and v6 (see also Figure 3).

4.2 Reﬂection and transmission of purely longitudinal waves at a Cauchy/relaxed-

micromorphic interface

In the remainder of this paper, we are interested in a ﬁrst calibration of the constitutive parameters of our
relaxed micromorphic model on a real experiment of wave transmission in a band gap metamaterial.

To do so, we focus on the experiment proposed in [11] in which only longitudinal waves are considered.
We hence consider here the solution of our relaxed problem only for what concerns the longitudinal part.
In other words we are only considering the longitudinal ﬁelds v1 and u1 together with the ﬁeld v6 which is
coupled to v1 through the boundary conditions (34).

In summary, the boundary value problem for longitudinal waves can be written as (see equations (4),

(19), (32), (33) and (34))

5 Reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients at a Cauchy/relaxed-

micromorphic interface. To this purpose we introduce the quantities

where Π is the period of the traveling plane wave and Hi , Hr and Ht are the energy ﬂuxes of the incident,
reﬂected and transmitted energies, respectively. The reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients can hence be
deﬁned as

R =

T =

Since the considered system is conservative, one must have R + T = 1.

In the particular case of reﬂection and transmission of longitudinal plane waves at a Cauchy/relaxed-
micromorphic interface, recalling equations (26) and (28) together with the solutions (40) for the unknown
ﬁelds we have:

1(λ + 2 µ) ui

Hi = ˙ui
1 = α1 ei(ω/cl x1−ω t) and ur

where we set ui

Hr = ˙ur

Ht = H 1

(42)

Since in this particular case we have shown that v+

1 does not contribute to the evaluation
of the transmitted energy. Once the solution for the energy ﬂuxes have been calculated for the considered
constraint (macro internal clamp with free microstructure), the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients can
be computed by using equations (41). We remark that R and T depend on the frequency ω of the traveling
waves and that we must always have R + T = 1.

5.1 Transmission coeﬃcient at a Cauchy/relaxed-micromorphic interface: the

+ 2µe(2µmicro(µe + µmicro) + λmicro(µe + 3µmicro))).

In Figure 5 we show a characteristic pattern of the transmission coeﬃcient at a Cauchy/relaxed-micromorphic

interface for a particular choice of the constitutive parameters and setting Lc = 0. The main characteristic
feature of the relaxed micromorphic model with Lc = 0 (internal variable model) is that two separate band
gaps can be determined and their bounds can be explicitly deﬁned as functions of the constitutive parameters
of the model according to equations (43).

Figure 5: Transmission coeﬃcient of the relaxed micromorphic model for λe = µe = λmicro = µmicro =
100 GP a and η = 1 kg/m.

Switching on and slowly increasing the parameter Lc produces small changes on the reﬂection proﬁle
of Figure 5 basically related to the smoothening of the sharp corners that can be seen corresponding to
the band-gap frequencies. We have shown in [15] that such situation in which two band gaps are precisely
identiﬁed with lower bounds ω1
l , respectively, is a degenerate limit case of the relaxed micromorphic
model obtained when setting the characteristic length Lc to be identically zero. Such model with Lc = 0
is also known as internal variable model and it has been shown to be able to catch the main features of
some particular classes of band-gap metamaterials (see [23,25]). Nevertheless, the fact of completely ignoring
non-local eﬀects in materials with heterogeneous microstructure may induce a certain amount of inaccuracy
in the modeling phase which could be hard to be controlled when necessary.

l and ω2

In the next section we will show that we can estimate the characteristic length Lc of the metamaterial
experimentally tested in [11] to be comparable to the order of magnitude of the diameters of the embedded
microstructure.

We will also show that, even if the estimated value of Lc is non- negligible with respect to the characteristic
size of the embedded microstructure, its eﬀect on the amount of energy which is transmitted in the considered
metamaterial is very small. This means that the error which is introduced if one uses an internal variable
model instead of a relaxed micromorphic one is energetically small. On the other hand, non-locality is a
fundamental feature of metamaterials with heterogeneous microstructure and as such it should always be
included in their modeling. As a matter of fact, non-local eﬀects are sensible to become more and more
important when the contrast in the mechanical properties between adjacent unitary cells at the microscopic
level becomes more pronounced.

As a general rule, we claim that the degenerate limit case Lc = 0 can be used for a ﬁrst rough ﬁtting of
the elastic parameters of the relaxed micromorphic model. After that, the characteristic length Lc must be
switched on in order to achieve a more accurate ﬁtting of the experimental results. This last operation will
allow for the estimate of non local eﬀects in real metamaterials.

The relaxed micromorphic model allows for the possibility of including non-local eﬀects in band-gap

metamaterials. In the next section we will have the twofold task of:

• ﬁtting at best our constitutive parameters on a real metamaterial,
• estimate the order of magnitude of non-localities in such metamaterial.

6 Modeling a two dimensional phononic crystal via the relaxed mi-

cromorphic model

In this section we are interested in the modeling of the mechanical behavior of a particular metamaterial
(phononic crystal) which has been seen to inhibit elastic wave propagation on an experimental basis (see [11]).
The structure presented, which is schematically shown in Figure 6(a) consists of a steel plate with liquid-
ﬁlled holes in square array. The lattice constant, denoted as a, is 3.0 mm, the thickness t of the plate is 15
mm, the diameter d of the hole is 1.8 mm and the width of the cavity, w, is 1.5 mm.

6.1 Experiments of wave transmission at a Cauchy/phononic-crystal interface
We show in Figure 7 the obtained experimental transmission spectrum of the considered phononic crystal,
i.e. with 8 rows of liquid-ﬁlled holes (see Figure 6(a)) as a function of the frequency of the traveling wave.
Given the geometry of the specimen shown in Figure 6, a longitudinal wave is sent in the Cauchy medium
left side and the transmission coeﬃcient is evaluated when the wave leaves the metamaterial on the opposite
side. With liquid ﬁlled holes the band gap edge crosses the −3 dB-level at ω1 = 586kHz. Transmission of
acoustic waves is suppressed until the upper edge at ω3 = 918 kHz but a single peak arises ω2 = 793 kHz,
which can be attributed to the resonance of the liquid-ﬁlled holes. The periodic variation of transmission at
lower frequencies is caused by Bragg resonances. The second transmission band extends to about ω4 (cid:39) 1
MHz.

Identiﬁcation of the parameters

6.2
In this subsection we present the procedure that we used in order to ﬁt in the best possible way the maximum
possible number of parameters of our relaxed micromorphic model on the available experimental data. To
start with, we ﬁx the macroscopic mass density to be known as the averaged density of steel with ﬂuid-ﬁlled
holes. In particular we choose ρ = 5000 kg/m3. Nevertheless, we verify a posteriori that the value of ρ indeed
does not sensibly aﬀect the proﬁle of the reﬂection coeﬃcient for frequencies between 0 and 1 M Hz. This
fact is sensible if, with reference to [14, 15] and to Figure 1, we notice that the parameter ρ only intervenes
in the deﬁnition of the oblique asymptote cp =
for longitudinal waves. Such asymptote governs
the slope of the optic wave LO1 which starts playing a signiﬁcant role for frequencies higher than ωp. In the
considered example ωp will be set to be equal to ω3 which is experimentally seen to be close to 1 M Hz. For
frequencies higher than 1 M Hz variations of ρ could eventually produce more tangible changes in the proﬁle
of the reﬂection coeﬃcient.

(cid:113) λe+2µe

ρ

To perform the ﬁtting of the remaining parameters, we started by imposing the following identities:

ω1
ω2

l (µe, µmicro, λe, λmicro, η) = ω1,
l (µe, µmicro, λe, λmicro, η) = ω2,

ωp(µe, µmicro, λe, λmicro, η) = ω3,

ωs(µe, µmicro, η) = ω2 − 8 kHz.

(45)

where we recall that the explicit expression of ω1
l , ωp as function of the elastic parameters of the
relaxed micromorphic model is given in equations (43). We hence have 4 conditions to determine the 5
elastic parameters µe, µmicro, λe, λmicro, η setting in a ﬁrst instance Lc = 0. If analogous experiments as the
one proposed in [11] for longitudinal waves would be reproduced on the same metamaterial but for transverse
waves, extra conditions on the parameters of the relaxed micromorphic model would be available that would
permit a more accurate ﬁtting.

l , ωs, ω2

We start by numerically solving the system of four equations (45) with respect to the parameters

17

λe, µmicro, λmicro and η leaving free the parameter µe. The obtained solution is8

λe = 4.58 µe,

µmicro = 7.21 µe,

λmicro = −2.57 µe,

η = 2.66 10−11 µe,

(46)

The free parameter µe is then varied in order to evaluate its inﬂuence on the reﬂection coeﬃcient. A para-
metric study on the free coeﬃcient µe is performed giving rise to the proﬁles of the transmission coeﬃcients
shown in Figure 8.

The corresponding proﬁle of the transmission coeﬃcients as compared to the experimental one is given

8We explicitly mention that, additionally to the solution (46) we obtain a second solution which, nevertheless must be
excluded since it violates the positive deﬁniteness of the strain energy density W . Solution (46) is then the only possible solution
which can be used to ﬁt the proﬁle of the transmission coeﬃcient. We checked that it is possible to leave free any other parameter
rather than µe to perform the desired ﬁtting of the transmission coeﬃcient and that it yields comparable results for the obtained
values of the constitutive parameters.

model with the values given in Table 1 and Lc = 0.

Figure 9 shows the comparison between the experimental proﬁle of the transmission coeﬃcient and the

one obtained with our relaxed micromorphic model when setting Lc = 0.

It can be seen that a very good ﬁtting can be obtained up to frequencies of the order of 1 M Hz.
In particular, the oscillatory behavior observed for lower frequencies and which, according to the authors

of [11], is due to Bragg scattering phenomena is catched by our model in an “averaged” sense.

The ﬁtting for higher frequencies is almost perfect up to reaching 1 M Hz, while for frequencies higher
than 1 M Hz the relaxed micromorphic model looses it predictivity due to the fact that the corresponding
wavelengths are so small that the continuum hypothesis is sensible to become inaccurate.

We need to explicitly remark that the peak of reﬂection, which is obtained around the frequency ω2 and
that is experimentally related to a resonant behavior of the ﬂuid inside the walls is slightly overestimated by
the simulation via the relaxed micromorphic model with respect to the experimentally observed one. This
peak magniﬁcation can be related to the fact that no dissipation is accounted for in our model, while the
ﬂuid viscosity may perhaps play here a non-negligible role.

We now come back to the point where we set Lc = 0 in order to start ﬁtting our constitutive parameters
(see subsection 5.1). This fact allowed us to obtain here the values of the elastic parameters of our model by
a ﬁrst ﬁtting with the experimental proﬁle of the transmission coeﬃcient (see Table 1).

On the other hand, as expected, switching on the characteristic length Lc allows an even better ﬁtting as

shown in Figure 10.

-

Figure 10: Fitting of the parameter Lc on the experimental proﬁle of the transmission coeﬃcients.

Indeed, we can notice from Figure 10 that the degenerate limit case Lc = 0 lets the calculated transmission
coeﬃcient slightly deviate from the experimental one (sharp corners). Small variations of the numerical proﬁle
can be perceived as far as Lc ∈ [0, 0.5 mm). On the other hand, as far as Lc = 0.5 mm an almost perfect
ﬁtting is achieved (dashed line in Figure 10 on the right)). This means that we have been able to estimate
the non-locality of the considered metamaterial to be of the order of 0.5 mm, i.e. ∼ 1/3 of the diameters of
the holes.

We need to explicitly say that the value of the macroscopic density ρ might slightly aﬀect the variation
of the transmission coeﬃcient as function of Lc. Nevertheless, we need to consider a density of 1 order of
magnitude higher (50 000 kg/m3) in order to appreciate a sensible deviation of the proﬁles shown in Figure
10. We leave to a subsequent work the aim of determining also the macroscopic mass density ρ by using
extra conditions provided by the fact of considering also measurements on transverse waves.

The determination of the parameter Lc completes the ﬁtting of the elastic parameters of our relaxed
micromorphic model on the band-gap metamaterial experimentally tested in [11] (see also Table 1). The
Cosserat couple modulus parameter µc cannot be measured as far as only longitudinal waves are considered
here and it thus remains to be determined. We have to explicitly remark that if an analogous ﬁtting procedure
would have been possible for transverse waves, we would have had more conditions than parameters to be
determined. The extra conditions could have been used as validation of the ﬁtted parameters.

It is out of the scope of this paper to envisage a general procedure for the optimal ﬁtting of the whole
set of parameters of the relaxed micromorphic model. We leave this fundamental objective to a forthcoming
paper where such general procedure will be deeply discussed based on experiments of real interest.

The main scope of the present paper that we think to have successfully achieved is threefold:
• we give the very ﬁrst estimation of the maximum possible number of constitutive parameters of the
relaxed micromorphic model based on a simple measurement of transmission of longitudinal waves at
a Cauchy/band-gap-metamaterial interface

• we give the very ﬁrst evidence of the non-locality in band-gap metamaterials based upon real experi-

ments

• we elucidate the physical meaning of the constraint which has been introduced in [15] and that we called
“internal clamp with free microstructure”: such constraint allows for the description of continuity of
displacement in the solid phase at the Cauchy/metamaterial interface, while the ﬂuid in the embedded
microstructure is free to vibrate. It is exactly the freedom which is left to the micro-motions that allows
for the description of the local resonant peak around the frequency ω2 which is indeed not possible for
other types of constraints (see [15]).

7 Conclusions
In the present paper we give the very ﬁrst estimate of the elastic coeﬃcients of the relaxed micromorphic model
based upon the experimental results presented in [11] which concern the measurement of the transmitted
energy as a function of the frequency of the traveling wave for a particular band-gap metamaterial. More
particularly, restricting our attention to the problem of studying reﬂection and transmission of longitudinal
waves at a Cauchy/relaxed-micromorphic interface, we are able to reproduce the main characteristic features
which are experimentally observed in [11] for a phononic crystal obtained by means of an aluminum plate
with small ﬂuid-ﬁlled holes (∼ 1.8 mm).

Suitably choosing the values of the parameters of our relaxed micromorphic model, we are able to ﬁt the

experimental proﬁle of the transmission coeﬃcient as function of the frequency of the traveling waves.

Two band-gaps which almost collapse to form a unique band-gap can be observed both experimentally

and as a result of the simulations based upon our relaxed micromorphic model.

The continuity of such extended band-gap is broken due to the presence of a resonant peak of transmitted

energy that is seen to be related to the internal resonance of the ﬂuid embedded in the microstructure.

We present a detailed procedure that we use to ﬁt almost all the parameters of our relaxed-micromorphic
model except the Cosserat couple modulus µc which remains undetermined. This indeterminacy is due
to the fact that experiments concerning reﬂection and transmission of transverse waves in the considered
metamaterial have not been performed yet.

We leave to a forthcoming contribution the problem of determining the whole set of parameters of the

relaxed micromorphic model for real band-gap metamaterials.

The results presented in this paper allow to give the ﬁrst physical interpretation of the boundary conditions

that can be imposed at a Cauchy/relaxed-micromorphic interface based upon a real experiment.

We conclude our paper with the ﬁnding that we believe to be the most important to be pointed out.
Indeed, we showed by direct comparison of our relaxed micromorphic model with available experimental
evidences that non-local eﬀects are an intrinsic feature of band-gap metamaterials.

A characteristic length Lc = 0.5 mm has been estimated for the phononic crystal experimentally studied

in [11] which is almost 1/3 of the diameter of the holes in the embedded microstructure.

Even if the energetic contribution associated to the underlying non-locality is very small (only small
changes in the transmission coeﬃcient can be appreciated when increasing Lc from 0 to 0.5 mm), such non-
locality is intrinsically present in any microstructured material and as such it should be always accounted for
when modeling their mechanical behavior.

The macroscopic eﬀects of non-localities are sensible to become more and more energetically signiﬁcant
when considering stronger contrasts in the mechanical properties at the microscopic level (e.g. unitary cells
with very diﬀerent stiﬀnesses). The relaxed micromorphic model should be always used when one wants to
model band-gap metamaterials in order to account for such non-localities.

In a subsequent work we will provide a more complete determination of the constitutive parameters of
the relaxed micromorphic model for real band-gap metamaterials and we will discuss further the importance
of non-local eﬀects in such microstructured materials.
