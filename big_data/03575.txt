Abstract

We are interested in a kinetic equation intended to describe the interaction of
particles with their environment. The environment is modeled by a collection of local
vibrational degrees of freedom. We establish the existence of weak solutions for a wide
class of initial data and external forces. We also identify a relevant regime which allows
us to derive, quite surprisingly, the attractive Vlasov–Poisson system from the coupled
Vlasov-Wave equations.

1 Introduction

In [8], L. Bruneau and S. De Bièvre introduced a mathematical model intended to
describe the interaction of a classical particle with its environment. The environment

is modeled by a vibrating scalar ﬁeld, and the dynamics is governed by energy exchanges
between the particle and the ﬁeld, embodied into a Hamiltonian structure. To be more
speciﬁc on the model in [8], let us denote by q(t) ∈ Rd the position occupied by the
particle at time t. The environment is represented by a ﬁeld (t, x, y) ∈ R × Rd × Rn 7→
Ψ(t, x, y) ∈ R: it can be thought of as an inﬁnite set of n-dimensional membranes, one
for each x ∈ Rd. The displacement of the membrane positioned at x ∈ Rd is given by
y ∈ Rn 7→ ψ(t, x, y) ∈ R. The coupling is realized by means of form factor functions
x 7→ σ1(x) and y 7→ σ2(y), which are supposed to be non-negative, inﬁnitely smooth,
radially symmetric and compactly supported. Therefore, the dynamic is described by
the following set of diﬀerential equations

¨q(t) = −∇V (q(t)) −ZRd×Rn
∂2
ttΨ(t, x, y) − c2∆yΨ(t, x, y) = −σ2(y)σ1(x − q(t)),

σ1(q(t) − z) σ2(y) ∇xΨ(t, z, y) dy dz,

x ∈ Rd, y ∈ Rn.



In (1), c > 0 stands for the wave speed in the transverse direction, while q ∈ Rd 7→
V (q) ∈ R is a time-independent external potential the particle is subjected to. In [8],
the well-posedness theory for (1) is investigated, but the main issue addressed there is
the large time behavior of the system. It is shown that the system exhibits dissipative
features: under certain circumstances (roughly speaking, n = 3 and c large enough)
and for a large class of ﬁnite energy initial conditions the particle energy is evacuated
in the membranes, and the environment acts with a friction force on the particle. Ac-
cordingly, the asymptotic behavior of the particle for large times can be characterized
depending on the external force: if V = 0, the particle stops exponentially fast, when
V is a conﬁning potential with a minimiser q0, then the particle stops at the location
q0, and for V (q) = −F · q, a limiting velocity VF can be identiﬁed.

Since then, a series of works has been devoted to further investigation of the asymp-
totic properties of a family of related models. We refer the reader to [1, 10, 11, 12, 25, 30]
for thorough numerical experiments and analytical studies, that use random walks ar-
guments in particular. The model can be seen as a variation on the Lorentz gas model
where one is interested in the free motion of a single point particle in a system of
obstacles distributed on a certain lattice. We refer the reader to [4, 9, 17, 19, 27]
for results and recent overviews on the Lorentz gas problem. Instead of dealing with
periodically or randomly distributed hard scatterers as in the Lorentz gas model, here
the particle interacts with a vibrational environment, that create the “soft” potential
Φ. The asymptotic analysis of the behavior of a particle subjected to an oscillating
potential is a further related problem that is also worth mentioning [16, 22, 24, 28].

We wish to revisit the model of [8] in the framework of kinetic equations. Instead
of considering a single particle described by its position t 7→ q(t), we work with the
particle distribution function in phase space f (t, x, v) ≥ 0, with x ∈ Rd, v ∈ Rd, the
position and velocity variables respectively. This quantity obeys the following Vlasov
equation

∂tf + v · ∇xf − ∇x(V + Φ) · ∇vf = 0,

t ≥ 0, x ∈ Rd, v ∈ Rd.

In (2), V stands for the external potential, while Φ is the self-consistent potential de-
scribing the interaction with the environment. It is deﬁned by the convolution formula

where the vibrating ﬁeld Ψ is driven by the following wave equation

The system is completed by initial data

f (0, x, v) = f0(x, v),

Ψ(0, x, y) = Ψ0(x, y),

∂tΨ(0, x, y) = Ψ1(x, y).

(5)

A possible interpretation of the kinetic equation (2) consists in considering the model
(1) for a set of N ≫ 1 particles. The deﬁnition of the self–consistent potential has to
be adapted since all the particles interact with the environment, namely we have, for
j ∈ {1, ..., N}

¨qj(t) = −∇V (qj(t)) −ZRd×Rn
∂2

Note that such a many-particle system is not considered in [8]. It is very likely that
its asymptotic behavior is much more complicated than with a single particle because,
even if the particles do not interact directly, they do so indirectly via their interaction
with the membranes. If we now adopt the mean–ﬁeld rescaling in which Φ → 1
N Φ,
then (2) can be obtained as the limit as N goes to ∞ for the empirical measure
fN (t, x, v) = 1
k=1 δ(x = qk(t), v = ˙qk(t)) of the N−particle system, assuming the
convergence of the initial state fN (0, x, v) → f0(x, v) in some suitable sense. Such a
statement can be rephrased in terms of the convergence of the joint distribution of the
N –particle system. This issue will be discussed elsewhere [31] and we refer the reader
to the lecture notes [18] and to [20] for further information on the mean–ﬁeld regimes
in statistical physics.

N PN

In this paper we wish to analyse several aspects of the Vlasov-Wave system (2)–(5).
We warn the reader that, despite the similarities in terminology, the model considered
here is very diﬀerent, both mathematically and physically, from the one dealt with in
[6], which is a simpliﬁed version of the Vlasov–Maxwell system. It is indeed crucial
to understand that the wave equation in this paper is set with variables transverse to
the physical space: the waves do not propagate at all in the space where the parti-
cles move. This leads to very diﬀerent physical eﬀects; we refer to [8] and references
therein for more details on this matter. We add that this paper is less ambitious than

3

[8], since we do not discuss here the large time behavior of the solutions, only their
global existence. As mentioned above, since we are dealing with many particles, it is
very likely that the question cannot be handled in the same terms as in [8], and that the
kinetic model inherits the same technical and conceptual diﬃculties already mentioned
for N > 1 particles. We only mention that a particular stationary solution (with f in-
tegrable) has been exhibited in [2], and that this solution is shown to be linearly stable.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains a preliminary and largely in-
formal discussion to set up notation and to establish some estimates on the interaction
potential needed in the bulk of the paper. Section 3 establishes the well–posedness of
the problem (2)–(5) (Theorem 3.3). We consider a large class of initial data and exter-
nal potentials with functional arguments which are reminiscient of Dobrushin’s analysis
of the Vlasov equation [15]. Section 4 is devoted to asymptotic issues which allow us
to connect (2)–(5) to Vlasov equations with an attractive self–consistent potential. In
particular, up to a suitable rescaling of the form function σ1, we can derive this way
the attractive Vlasov–Poisson system. This is quite surprising and unexpected in view
of the very diﬀerent physical motivation of the models.

2 Preliminary discussion

Throughout the paper, we make the following assumptions on the model parameters
and on the initial conditions. First, on the coupling functions σ1, σ2, we impose:

σ1 ∈ C∞c (Rd, R), σ2 ∈ C∞c (Rn, R),
σ1(x) ≥ 0, σ2(y) ≥ 0 for any x ∈ Rd, y ∈ Rn,
σ1, σ2 are radially symmetric.


( V ∈ W 2,∞loc (Rd),
and there exists C ≥ 0 such that V (x) ≥ −C(1 + |x|2) for any x ∈ Rd.

We require that the external potential fulﬁlls

(H1)

(H2)

This is a rather standard and natural assumption. Note that it ensures global existence
when σ1 = 0 = σ2: it then implies that the external potential cannot drive the particle
to inﬁnity in ﬁnite time. For the initial condition of the vibrating environment, we
shall assume

For the initial particle distribution function, we naturally assume

Ψ0, Ψ1 ∈ L2(Rd × Rn).

For energy considerations, it is also relevant to suppose

f0 ≥ 0,

f0 ∈ L1(Rd × Rd).

(H3)

(H4)

∇yΨ0 ∈ L2(Rd × Rn)
This means that the initial state has ﬁnite mass, potential and kinetic energy.

(cid:16)(x, v) 7→ (V (x) + |v|2)f0(x, v)(cid:17) ∈ L1(Rd × Rd). (H5)

and

Our goal in this section is to rewrite the equations of the coupled system (2)-(5) in
an equivalent manner, more suitable for our subsequent analysis. The discussion will
be informal, with all computations done for suﬃciently smooth solutions. The proper
functional framework will be provided in the next section. First, we note that it is
clear that (2) preserves the total mass of the particles

d

f (t, x, v) dv dx = 0.

In fact, since the ﬁeld (v,∇xV + ∇xΦ) is divergence–free (with respect to the phase
variables (x, v)), any Lp norm of the density f is conserved, 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞. Furthermore,
the PDEs system (2)–(4) inherits from the Hamiltonian nature of the original equations
of motion (1) the following easily checked energy conservation property:

+ V (x) + Φ(t, x)! dv dx) = 0.

As a matter of fact the energy remains ﬁnite when the full set of assumptions (H1)–
(H5) holds.

For the Vlasov–Poisson equation it is well known that the potential can be expressed
by means of a convolution formula. Similarly here, the self-consistent potential Φ
can be computed explicitly as the image of a certain linear operator acting on the

macroscopic density ρ(t, x) =RRd f (t, x, v) dv; this follows from the fact that the linear

wave equation (4) can be solved explicitly as the sum of the solution of the homogeneous
wave equation with the correct initial conditions plus the retarded solution of the
inhomogeneous wave equation. To see how this works, we introduce

where the symbol b· stands for the Fourier transform with respect to the variable

given initial conditions for Ψ. Finally, we deﬁne the operator L which associates to a
distribution function f : (0,∞) × Rd × Rd → R the quantity

f (0, x, v) = f0(x, v)

and Ψ is the unique solution of (4).

We sketch the computation, which is instructive. Let (f, Ψ) be a solution of (2)–(4).

Applying the Fourier transform with respect to the variable y we ﬁnd

The solution reads

Inserting this relation into (2), we arrive at (8). Conversely, let f be a solution of (8)
and let Ψ be the unique solution of (4). The same computation then shows that Φ
in (3) is given by Φ = Φ0 − L(f ). Therefore f satisﬁes (2).

The operator L in (7) plays a crucial role in our further analysis. Its precise deﬁ-
nition on an appropriate functional space and its basic continuity properties are given
in the following Lemma.
Lemma 2.1 (Estimates on the interaction potential) For any 0 < T < ∞, the
following properties hold:
i) L belongs to the space AT of continuous operators on C(cid:0)[0, T ];(cid:0)W 1,∞(Rd× Rd)(cid:1)′(cid:1)
with values in C(cid:0)[0, T ]; W 2,∞(Rd)(cid:1). Its norm is evaluated as follows:

with values in C 1(cid:0)[0, T ]; L∞(Rd)(cid:1). Its norm is evaluated as follows:

Proof. The last statement is a direct consequence of Hölder and Young inequalities;

hρf , χi(W 1,∞)′,W 1,∞(Rd) = hf, χ ⊗ 1vi(W 1,∞)′,W 1,∞(Rd×Rd) ,

for any 0 ≤ t ≤ T , and, moreover
kΦ0kC1([0,T ];L∞(Rd)) ≤ kσ1kL2(Rd)kσ2kW 1,2(Rn)(cid:16)2kΨ0kL2(Rn) + (1 + T )kΨ1kL2(Rn)(cid:17) .
let us detail the proof of items i) and ii). We associate to f ∈(cid:0)W 1,∞(Rd × Rd)(cid:1)′, the
macroscopic density ρ ∈(cid:0)W 1,∞(Rd)(cid:1)′ by the formula:
Clearly, we have kρfk(cid:0)W 1,∞(Rd)(cid:1)′ ≤ kfk(cid:0)W 1,∞(Rd×Rd)(cid:1)′.
For any χ ∈ C∞c (Rd), and i ∈ {0, 1, 2} , we can check the following estimates
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:10)ρ ∗ Σ,∇iχ(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:12) = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:10)ρ,(cid:0)∇iΣ(cid:1) ∗ χ(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ kρk(cid:0)W 1,∞(Rd)(cid:1)′k(cid:0)∇iΣ(cid:1) ∗ χkW 1,∞(Rd)

Since the dual space of L1 is L∞, for i = 0, we deduce that

L2(Rn).

Reasoning similarly for i = 1 and i = 2, we obtain

kρ ∗ ΣkW 2,∞(Rd) ≤ kσ1k2

We now estimate p. Plancherel’s inequality yields

|p′(t)| =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Since p(0) = 0, it follows that |p(t)| ≤ kσ2k2

This proves the estimate in i). That L(f )(t) is continuous as a function of t follows
easily from the previous argument. As a further by-product note that

3 Existence of solutions

The proof of existence of solutions to (8) relies on estimates satisﬁed by the character-
istics curves deﬁned by the following ODE system:

( ˙X(t) = ξ(t),
˙ξ(t) = −∇V (X(t)) − ∇Φ(t, X(t)).

(10)

From now on, we adopt the following notation. The potential Φ being given, we
α (x0, v0) ∈ Rd × Rd the solution of (10) which starts from (x0, v0) at time
denote by ϕΦ,t
t = α: the initial data is ϕΦ,α
α (x0, v0) = (x0, v0). We use the shorthand notation t 7→
(X(t), ξ(t)) for t 7→ ϕΦ,t
0 (x0, v0), the solution of (10) with X(0) = x0 and V (0) = v0.
Owing to the regularity of V, L and Φ0, see Lemma 2.1, the solution of the diﬀerential
system (10) is indeed well deﬁned for prescribed initial data; this also allows us to
establish the following estimates, where characteristics are evaluated both forward and
backward.

Lemma 3.1 (Estimates on the characteristic curves) Let V satisfy (H2) and
let Φ ∈ C 0([0,∞); W 2,∞(Rd)) ∩ C 1([0,∞); L∞(Rd)).
a) There exists a function (N , t, x, v) ∈ [0,∞)× [0,∞)× Rd × Rd 7→ R(N , t, x, v) ∈
[0,∞), non decreasing with respect to the ﬁrst two variables, such that the solution
t 7→ (X(t), ξ(t)) of (10) with initial data X(0) = x0, ξ(0) = v0 satisﬁes the
following estimate, for any t ∈ R,

(X(t), ξ(t)) ∈ B(cid:16)0, R(cid:16)kΦkC1([0,t];L∞(Rd)),|t|, x0, v0(cid:17)(cid:17) ⊂ Rd × Rd.

b) Taking two diﬀerent potentials Φ1 and Φ2, the following two estimates hold for

where we set Bτ (x, v) = B(cid:16)0, R(cid:16)maxi=1,2 kΦikC1([0,τ ];L∞(Rd)), τ, x, v(cid:17)(cid:17) and ˜Bt,τ =
B(cid:16)0, R(cid:16)maxi=1,2 kΦikC1([τ,t];L∞(Rd)), t − τ, x, v(cid:17)(cid:17).
The proof of the lemma is postponed the end of this section. Given 0 < R0 < ∞,

and Ψ0, Ψ1 satisfying (H3) (they enter into the deﬁnition of Φ0 in (6)), we set

r(t, x, v) = R(kΦ0kC1([0,t];L∞(Rd)) + |||L|||Bt R0, t, x, v).

(11)

Proving uniqueness statements for the wide class of external potentials considered
in(H2) requires to strengthen the hypothesis on the initial data.
Deﬁnition 3.2 Let 0 < T, R0 < ∞. We say that an integrable function f0 belongs to
the set ER0,T if f0 ≥ 0 satisﬁes kf0kL1(Rd×Rd) ≤ R0 and, furthermore,

Theorem 3.3 Assume (H1)–(H3). Let 0 < R0, T < ∞. Let f0 ∈ ER0,T . Then,
there exists a unique f ∈ C([0, T ]; L1(Rd × Rd)) weak solution of (8). The solution
is continuous with respect to the parameters L, Φ0 and f0, respectively in AT ∩ BT ,
C 1([0,∞); W 2,∞(Rd)) and ER0,T . If f0 ∈ L1(Rd× Rd) only, see (H4), then there exists
f ∈ C([0,∞); L1(Rd × Rd)), weak solution of (8).
The statement can be rephrased for the original problem (2)–(5). We also establish
the conservation of energy.

Corollary 3.4 Assume (H1)–(H3). Let 0 < R0, T < ∞. Let f0 ∈ ER0,T . Then, there
exists a unique weak solution (f, Ψ) to the system (2)–(5) with f ∈ C([0, T ]; L1(Rd ×
Rd)) and Ψ ∈ C([0, T ]; L2(Rd × Rn)). The solution is continuous with respect to the
parameters σ1, σ2, Ψ0, Ψ1 and f0 in the sets W 3,2(Rd), L2(Rn), L2(Rd × Rn), L2(Rd×
Rn) and ER0,T , respectively. If f0 satisﬁes (H4) only, then there exists a weak solution

is conserved.

Remark 3.5 Deﬁnition 3.2 restricts the set of initial data depending on the growth
of the Hessian of the external potential. Of course, any integrable data f0 with com-
pact support fulﬁls the criterion in Deﬁnition 3.2, and when the potential has at most
quadratic growth, any data satisfying (H4) is admissible. As will be clear in the proof,
the continuity with respect to the initial data does not involve the L1 norm only, but
the more intricate quantity KR0,T also arises in the analysis.

Remark 3.6 The present approach does not need a restriction on the transverse di-
mension (n ≥ 3 in [8]). The proof can be slightly modiﬁed to treat the case of
measure–valued initial data f0, thus including the results in [8] for a single parti-
cle (f0(x, v) = δ(x=x0,v=v0)), and we can consider a set of N > 1 particles as well.
The measure–valued solution is then continuous with respect to the initial data in
C([0, T ]; (W 1,∞(Rd × Rd))′). This viewpoint will be further detailed with the discus-
sion of mean–ﬁeld asymptotics [31].

The proof of Theorem 3.3 relies on a ﬁxed point strategy, the diﬃculty being to
set up the appropriate functional framework. It turns out that it will be convenient to

work with the C(cid:0)[0, T ]; (W 1,∞(Rd × Rd))′(cid:1) norm. We remind the reader that the dual
norm on (W 1,∞(Rd × Rd))′ is equivalent to the Kantorowich–Rubinstein distance

W1(f, g) = sup

π nZR2d×R2d |ζ − ζ′| dπ(ζ, ζ′)o

where the supremum is taken over measures π having f and g as marginals, see e. g. [32,
Remark 6.5]. This distance appears naturally in the analysis of Vlasov–like systems,
as pointed out in [15]. In order to deﬁne the ﬁxed point procedure, we introduce the
following mapping. For a non negative integrable function f0, we denote by Λf0 the
application which associates to Φ in C([0,∞); W 2,∞(Rd)) ∩ C 1([0,∞); L∞(Rd)) the
unique solution f of the Liouville equation

∂tf + v · ∇xf − ∇vf · ∇x (V + Φ) = 0,

with initial data f0. We shall make use of the following statement, which provides
useful estimates.
Lemma 3.7 For any f0 ∈ L1(Rd × Rd), the application Λf0 is continuous on the
set C([0,∞); W 2,∞(Rd)) ∩ C 1([0,∞); L∞(Rd)) with values in C([0,∞); L1(Rd × Rd)).
Furthermore, we have

kΛf0(Φ) − Λg0(Φ)kL∞(0,∞;L1(Rd×Rd)) = kf0 − g0kL1(Rd×Rd),

for any Φ ∈ C([0,∞); W 2,∞(Rd)) ∩ C 1([0,∞); L∞(Rd)).
Proof.
and compactly supported. For any 0 ≤ t ≤ T , we have
Λf0(Φ)(t) = f0 ◦ ϕΦ,0
,

t

Let 0 < T < ∞ be ﬁxed once for all. We begin by assuming that f0 is C 1

t

where we remind the reader that ϕΦ,0
(x, v) stands for the evaluation at time 0 of
the solution of (10) which starts at time t from the state (x, v). Accordingly any Lp
norm is preserved: kΛf0(Φ)(t)kLp(Rd×Rd) = kf0kLp(Rd×Rd) holds for any t ≥ 0 and any
1 ≤ p ≤ ∞. By linearity, this immediately proves the continuity estimate with respect
to the initial data.
To establish the continuity properties with respect to Φ, we ﬁrst observe, denot-
ing Λf0(Φ) = f , that (x, v) ∈ supp(f (t,·)) iﬀ ϕΦ,0
(x, v) ∈ supp(f0), that is (x, v) ∈
ϕΦ,t
0 (supp(f0)). Therefore, by Lemma 3.1, we can ﬁnd a compact set KT ⊂ Rd × Rd

10

such that supp(f (t,·)) ⊂ KT for any 0 ≤ t ≤ T . We are dealing with potentials Φ1
and Φ2 in C([0,∞); W 2,∞(Rd)) ∩ C 1([0,∞); L∞(Rd)). We can again ﬁnd a compact
set, still denoted by KT ⊂ Rd × Rd, such that the support of the associated solutions
Λf0(Φ1) and Λf0(Φ2) for any 0 ≤ t ≤ T is contained in KT . We infer that

(It is important to keep both the C 1([0, T ]; L∞(Rd)) and L∞(0, T ; W 2,∞(Rd)) norms
of the potentials bounded since these quantities appear in the deﬁnition of R and mT .)
This proves the asserted continuity of the solution with respect to the potential. By
uniform continuity of the ﬂow on the compact set [0, T ] × KT , we obtain the time
continuity. Hence the result is proved when the initial data f0 lies in C 1

We ﬁnally extend the result for initial data f0 in L1. Those can be approximated
by a sequence(cid:0)f k

Therefore, Λf0 is the uniform limit of maps which are continuous with respect to Φ

Existence–uniqueness for initial data in ER0.T .

We turn to the ﬁxed point reasoning. For f given in C(cid:0)[0, T ]; (W 1,∞(Rd × Rd))′(cid:1),

we set

Tf0(f ) = Λf0(Φ0 − L(f )).

11

It is clear that a ﬁxed point of Tf0 is a solution to (8). Note also that, as a conse-
quence of Lemma 2.1 and Lemma 3.7, Tf0(f )(t) ∈ L1(Rd × Rd). More precisely, we
know that f 7→ T (f ) is continuous with values in the space C([0, T ]; L1(Rd × Rd)) ⊂
C(cid:0)[0, T ]; (W 1,∞(Rd × Rd))′(cid:1). We shall prove that T admits an iteration which is a
contraction on the ball with centre 0 and radius R0.

This shows that an iteration of T is a contraction. Therefore, there exists a unique ﬁxed
point f in C(cid:0)[0, T ]; (W 1,∞(Rd × Rd))′(cid:1). Furthermore, f = T (f ) ∈ C([0, T ]; L1(Rd ×
Rd)), and the solution is continuous with respect to the parameters of the system. Note
that the continuity estimate involves the quantity in Deﬁnition 3.2 which restricts the
growth assumption of the initial data.

Step 2: Existence for an integrable data

We proceed by approximation. Let f0 be in L1(Rd × Rd), with kf0kL1 ≤ R0. Then,

(x, v) 7→ f k

0 (x, v) = f0(x, v)1√x2+v2≤k

(13)

and, on the other hand,

lies in ER0,T (with a constant KR0,T which can blow up as k → ∞). The previous
step deﬁnes f k, solution of (8) with this initial data. Of course we wish to conclude by
passing to the limit k → ∞. However, the necessary compactness arguments are not
direct and the proof splits into several steps.
We start by showing that the sequence (cid:0)f k(cid:1)k∈N is compact in C([0, T ];M1(Rd ×
Rd)− weak− ⋆). Pick χ ∈ C∞c (Rd × Rd). For any 0 ≤ t ≤ T , we have, on the one hand,

Lemma 2.1 then ensures that the set

is equibounded and equicontinuous; hence, by virtue of Arzela–Ascoli’s theorem it is
relatively compact in C([0, T ]). Going back to (13), a simple approximation argument
allows us to extend the conclusion to any trial function χ in C0(Rd × Rd), the space of
continuous functions that vanish at inﬁnity.

This space is separable; consequently, by a diagonal argument, we can extract a
subsequence and ﬁnd a measure valued function t 7→ df (t) ∈ M1(Rd × Rd) such that

lim

f k(t, x, v)χ(x, v) dv dx =ZRd×Rd

χ(x, v) df (t)

holds uniformly on [0, T ], for any χ ∈ C0(Rd × Rd). As a matter of fact, we note that
df is non negative and for any 0 ≤ t ≤ T it satisﬁes

ZRd×Rd

df (t) ≤ kf0kL1(Rd×Rd).

Next, we establish the tightness of the sequence of approximate solutions. Let ǫ > 0

be ﬁxed once for all. We can ﬁnd Mǫ > 0 such that

Zx2+v2≥M 2

f0(x, v) dv dx ≤ ǫ.

Let us set

Aǫ = sup{r(T, x, v), (x, v) ∈ B(0, Mǫ)}

where we remind the reader that r(T, x, v) has been deﬁned in (11): 0 < Aǫ < ∞ is
well deﬁned by Lemma 2.1. Let ϕk,t
α stand for the ﬂow associated to the characteristics
of the equation satisﬁed by f k. For any 0 ≤ t ≤ T , we have ϕk,t
0 (B(0, Mǫ)) ⊂ B(0, Aǫ)
so that ∁(cid:16)ϕk,0

t (cid:0)∁B(0, Aǫ)(cid:1) ⊂ ∁B(0, Mǫ). It follows that

By a standard approximation, we check that the same estimate is satisﬁed by the
limit f :

df (t) ≤ ǫ.

Finally, we justify that f k converges to f in C([0, T ]; (W 1,∞(Rd × Rd))′). Pick χ
in W 1,∞(Rd × Rd), with kχkW 1,∞(Rd×Rd) ≤ 1. We introduce a cut-oﬀ function θR as
follows:

Then, we split

θ ∈ C∞c (Rd × Rd),

θR(x, v) = θ(x/R, v/R),

θ(x, v) = 1 for √x2 + v2 ≤ 1, θ(x) = 0 for x2 + v2 ≥ 4,
0 ≤ θ(x) ≤ 1 for any x ∈ Rd.

(15)

By virtue of the Arzela-Ascoli theorem, W 1,∞(B(0, 2R)) embeds compactly in C(B(0, 2R)).
Thus, we can ﬁnd a family {χ1, ..., χmǫ} of functions in W 1,∞(Rd × Rd) such that, for
any χ ∈ W 1,∞(Rd × Rd), kχkW 1,∞(Rd×Rd) ≤ 1, there exists an index i ∈ {1, ..., mǫ}
with kθRχ − χikL∞(B(0,2R)) ≤ ǫ (since χθR lies in a bounded ball of W 1,∞(B(0, 2R))).
Therefore, let us write
ZRd×Rd

where the last two terms can both be dominated by kf0kL1(Rd×Rd)ǫ. We thus arrive at

smaller than ǫ by choosing k ≥ Nǫ large enough. In other words, we can ﬁnd Nǫ ∈ N
such that

holds for any 0 ≤ t ≤ T , and k ≥ Nǫ: f k converges to f in C(cid:0)[0, T ]; (W 1,∞(Rd× Rd))′(cid:1).
According to Lemma 3.7, together with Lemma 2.1, it implies that Tf0(f k) converges
to Tf0(f ) in C([0, T ]; L1(Rd × Rd)).

holds, where we have used Lemma 3.7 again. Letting k go to ∞, we realize that f k
also converges to Tf0(f ) in C([0, T ]; L1(Rd × Rd)).
It implies both f = Tf0(f ) and

that f is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure, which ends the
proof.

Proof of Lemma 3.1. Let (X, ξ) be the solution of (10) with (X(0), ξ(0)) = (x0, v0).
We have

The right hand side is dominated by k∂tΦkC([0,t];L∞(Rd)). With t ≥ 0, integrating this
relation yields

2 (cid:17) − (V (X(t)) + Φ(t, X(t))) + tk∂tΦkC([0,t];L∞(Rd)).
|ξ(t)|2
|ξ(t)|2 ≤ a(t) + 2C|X(t)|2

Owing to (H2) we deduce that

holds with

a(t) = 2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)V (x0) + Φ(0, x0) + |v0|2

Next, we simply write

2 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) + 2tk∂tΦkC([0,t];L∞(Rd)) + 2kΦ(t,·)kL∞ (Rd) + 2C.

Next, let (X1, ξ1) and (X2, ξ2) be two solutions of (10) with the same initial data
(x0, v0), but diﬀerent potentials Φ1, Φ2. We already know that the two characteristic

Proof of Corollary 3.4. Theorem 3.3 constructs solutions to (8) in C 0([0,∞); L1(Rd×
Rd)). We have now the functional framework necessary to justify the manipula-
tions made in Section 2. For Ψ0, Ψ1 verifying (H3), formula (9) deﬁnes a solution
Ψ ∈ C([0,∞); L2(Rn × Rd)) of the wave equation, and ﬁnally (f, Ψ) satisﬁes (2)–(5).
Conversely, if f ∈ C 0([0,∞); L1(Rd × Rd)) and Ψ ∈ C([0,∞); L2(Rn × Rd)) is a solu-
tion of the system (2)–(5), then we can rewrite Φ = Φ0 − L(f ) and f veriﬁes (8). This
equivalence justiﬁes the ﬁrst part of the statement in Corollary 3.4.
It only remains to justify the energy conservation. We consider an initial data with

ﬁnite energy:

For the solutions constructed in Theorem 3.3, we have seen that the self–consistent
potential remains smooth enough so that the characteristic curves t 7→ (X(t), ξ(t)) are
well–deﬁned. Therefore, we can write

Next, let Ψ be the unique solution of (4) associated to f . We ﬁrst assume that the
initial data Ψ0 et Ψ1 are smooth, say in L2(Rd, H 2(Rn)). Therefore, going back to (9),
we can check that Ψ lies in C([0,∞); L2(Rd, H 2(Rn))). Integrations by parts lead to

It proves the energy conservation for such smooth data.

We go back to general data with ﬁnite energy: Ψ0 ∈ L2(Rd, H 1(Rn)) and Ψ1 ∈
1 lying in L2(Rd, H 2(Rn)). Using
L2(Rd × Rn). We approximate the data by Ψk
(9), one sees the associated sequence (Ψk)k∈N of solutions to (4) converges to Ψ in
C([0,∞); L2(Rd, H 1(Rn))) and C 1([0,∞); L2(Rd × Rn)). This implies one can pass to
the limit in the energy conservation.

0 and Ψk

Remark 3.8 We point out that, whereas energy conservation is an important physical
property, it was not used here in the existence proof. In particular, one should notice
that it does not provide directly useful a priori estimates on the kinetic energy, since the
potential energy associated to the external potential V can be negative and unbounded
under our assumptions. In order to deduce a useful estimate the assumptions on the

18

initial data need to be strengthened: in addition to (H5) we suppose

M2 :=ZRd×Rd

f0(x, v)|x|2 dv dx < ∞.

We set V−(x) = max(−V (x), 0) ≥ 0. Then (H2) implies
ZRd×Rd

f (t, x, v)V−(x) dv dx ≤ZRd×Rd

f (t, x, v)C(1 + |x|2) dv dx

Therefore the potential energy associated to the external potential cannot be too negative
and all terms in the energy balance remain bounded on any ﬁnite time interval.

4 Large wave speed asymptotics

This section is devoted to the asymptotics of large wave speeds. Namely, we consider
the following rescaled version of the system:



Ψǫ(t, z, y)σ2(y)σ1(x − z) dz dy,

σ1(x − z)f (t, z, v) dv dz,

(16)

completed with suitable initial conditions. We are interested in the behavior of the
solutions as ǫ → 0. We shall discuss below the physical meaning of this regime. But,

19

let us ﬁrst explain on formal grounds what can be expected. As ǫ → 0 the wave
equation degenerates to

−∆yΨ(t, x, y) = −σ2(y) σ1 ∗x

ρ(t, x),

ρ(t, x) =ZRd

f (t, x, v) dv.

We obtain readily the solution by uncoupling the variables:

Ψ(t, x, y) = γ(y) σ1 ∗x

ρ(t, x)

where γ satisﬁes the mere Poisson equation ∆yγ = σ2. At leading order the potential
then becomes

Φ(t, x) = −κ Σ ∗x

ρ(t, x),

Σ = σ1 ∗ σ1,

κ = −ZRn

σ2γ dy.

Therefore, we guess that the limiting behavior is described by the following Vlasov
equation

∂tf + v · ∇xf − ∇x(V + Φ) · ∇vf = 0.

As long as the integration by parts makes sense (we shall see that diﬃculties in the
analysis precisely arise when n ≤ 2), we observe that
κ =ZRn |∇yγ|2 dy > 0.

It is then tempting to make the form function σ1 depend on ǫ too, so that Σ resembles
the kernel of (−∆x). We would arrive at the Vlasov–Poisson system, in the case of
attractive forces. We which to justify such asymptotic behavior.

4.1 Dimensional analysis

In (2), f is the density of particles in phase space: it gives a number of particles per unit
volume of phase space. Let T, L,V be units for time, space and velocity respectively,
and set

which deﬁne dimensionless quantities. Then, we set

t′ = t/T,

x′ = x/L,

v′ = v/V

f′(t′, x′, v′) L−d V−d = f (t, x, v)

(or maybe more conveniently f′(t′, x′, v′) dv′ dx′ = f (t, x, v) dv dx). The external and
interaction potential, V and Φ, have both the dimension of a velocity squared. We set

V (x) = V 2

ext V ′(x′),

Φ(t, x) = W 2 Φ′(t′, x′),

where Vext and W thus have the dimension of a velocity. We switch to the dimensionless
equation

∂t′f′ + VT

v′ · ∇x′f′ −

T

LV V 2∇x′(cid:16)V ′ +(cid:16)W
V (cid:17)2

Φ′(cid:17) · ∇v′f′ = 0.

20

The deﬁnition of the interaction potential Φ is driven by the product σ2(z)σ1(x) dx.
We scale it as follows

σ2(z)σ1(x) dx = Σ⋆Ldσ′2(z′)σ′1(x′) dx′.

It might help the intuition to think z as a length variable, and thus c has a velocity, but
there is not reason to assume such privileged units. Thus, we keep a general approach.
For the vibrating ﬁeld, we set

ψ(t, x, z) = Ψ⋆ ψ′(t′, x′, z′),

z′ = z/ℓ,

still with the convention that primed quantities are dimensionless. Accordingly, we
obtain

and the consistent expression of the dimensionless potential

W 2 = Σ⋆LdΨ⋆ℓn

Let us consider the energy balance where the following quantities, all having the

• the kinetic energy of the particles R v2f dv dx; it scales like V 2,
• the external potential energyR V f dv dx; it scales like V 2
• the coupling energyR Φf dv dx; it scales like W 2,
• the wave energy which splits into:

To recap, we have at hand 6 parameters imposed by the model (L, ℓ, c,Vext,W, Σ⋆)
and two parameters governed by the initial conditions V and Ψ⋆. They allow to deﬁne
the ﬁve energies described above.

21

We turn to the scaling assumptions. It is convenient to think of them by comparing

the diﬀerent time scales involved in the equations. We set

cT(cid:19)2
ǫ =(cid:18) ℓ

≪ 1.

If ℓ is the size of the support of the source σ2, then this regime means that the time a
typical particle needs to cross L (the support of σ1) is much longer than the time the
wave needs to cross ℓ (the support of σ2). Next we suppose that the kinetic energy of
the particle, the energy of the particle associated to the external potential, the elastic
energy of the wave as well as the interaction energy, all have the same strength, which
can expressed by setting

L
T

= V = Vext = W =qc2Ψ2

⋆Ldℓn−2.

As a consequence, it imposes the following scaling of the coupling constant

Ψ⋆
T 2Σ⋆

= ǫ.

It also means that the kinetic energy of the wave is small with respect to its elastic
energy. Inserting this in (17) yields (16).

4.2 Statements of the results

Throughout this Section, we assume (H1), and we shall strengthen the assumptions
(H2)–(H5) as follows (note that since we are dealing with sequences of initial data, it
is important to make the estimates uniform with respect to the scaling parameter):

the external potential V ∈ W 2,∞loc (Rd) is non negative,

f0,ǫ ∈ L1(Rd × Rd), with a uniformly bounded norm,
and Ψ0,ǫ, Ψ1,ǫ ∈ L2(Rd × Rn) are such that the rescaled initial energy
E0,ǫ =ZRd×Rd(cid:16) v2
is uniformly bounded: 0 ≤ supǫ>0 E0,ǫ = ¯E0 < ∞.

Next, we establish the tightness of (cid:0)fǫ(cid:1)ǫ>0 with respect to the velocity variable,
which will be necessary to show that the macroscopic density ρǫ passes to the limit.
Since Φ0,ǫ and 1

Let us denote by Iǫ(t, x), IIǫ(t, x), IIIǫ(t), the three terms of the right hand side. Firstly,
for any t > 0, IIIǫ(t) tends to 0 as ǫ → 0, and it is dominated by κkΣkW 1,∞(Rd)M0.
Secondly, for any 0 < T < ∞ and any compact set K ⊂ Rd, when (t, x) lies in [0, T ]×K,
we can estimate

|Iǫ(t, x)| ≤ k∇xΣ ∗ ρǫ − ∇xΣ ∗ ρkL∞([0,T ]×K)kqkL1([0,∞)

which also goes to 0 as ǫ → 0. Eventually, still considering (t, x) ∈ [0, T ]× K, we write

|IIǫ(t, x)| ≤Z t/√ǫ

sup

z∈K |∇xΣ ∗ ρ(t − s√ǫ, z) − ∇xΣ ∗ ρ(t, z)| |q(s)| ds.

27

By using the Lebesgue theorem, we justify that it tends to 0 as ǫ → 0 since (t, x) 7→
∇xΣ∗ ρ(t, x) is uniformly continuous over any compact set, the integrand is dominated
by 2kΣkW 1,∞(Rd)M0|q(s)|, and q ∈ L1([0,∞)). Therefore, for any 0 < t < T < ∞ and

and this quantity is bounded uniformly with respect to 0 ≤ t ≤ T < ∞ and ǫ > 0.
We go back to the weak formulation of (16). Let χ ∈ C∞c ([0,∞) × Rd × Rd). We
suppose that supp(χ) ⊂ [0, T ] × ¯B(0, M ) × ¯B(0, M ). We have

We conclude by a mere application of the Lebesgue Theorem.

If the initial data f0,ǫ converge strongly to f0 in Lp(Rd × Rd), the nature of the con-
vergence of fǫ to f can be improved by applying general stability results for transport
equations, see [13, Th. II.4 & Th. II.5], or [7, Th. VI.1.9].

Proof of Lemma 4.5 As a matter of fact, the variable x ∈ Rd just appears as a
parameter for the wave equation, and Υǫ(t, x, y) = (σ1 ∗eΨǫ(t,·, y))(x) solves the linear
wave equation

with the data

Υǫ(0, x, y) = σ1 ∗ Ψ0,ǫ(x, y),

∂tΥǫ(0, x, y) = σ1 ∗ Ψ1,ǫ(x, y).

28

The parameter x being ﬁxed, we appeal to the Strichartz estimate, see [23, Corollary
1.3] or [29, Theorem 4.2, for the case n = 3],

where we set

A similar reasoning applies to ∇xΥǫ with ∇xσ1 replacing σ1. Let χ ∈ C∞c ([0,∞) ×

4.4 Convergence to the Vlasov–Poisson system

The existence theory for the Vlasov–Poisson system dates back to [3]; an overview of
the features of both the repulsive or attractive cases can be found in the lecture notes
[5]. The following statements are classical tools of this analysis, that will be useful for
our purposes as well.
Lemma 4.6 (Interpolation estimates) Let f ∈ L1 ∩ L∞(Rd × Rd) be such that
|v|mf ∈ L1(Rd × Rd). Then ρ =RRd f dv lies in L(m+d)/d(Rd) with

kρkL(d+m)/d(Rd) ≤ C(m, d)kfkm/(d+m)(Rd )

L∞

(cid:18)Z |v|mf dv dx(cid:19)d/(d+m)

.

where C(m, d) = 2|B(0, 1)|m/(m+d).
Lemma 4.7 (Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality) Let 1 < p, r < ∞ and 0 <
λ < d. Assume 1/p + 1/r = 2 − λ/d. There exists a constant C > 0 such that for any
f ∈ Lp(Rd) and g ∈ Lr(Rd) we have
f (x)g(y)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ZRd×Rd

|x − y|λ dy dx(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ CkfkLp(Rd)kgkLr (Rd).

We refer the reader to [5, Lemma 3.4] and [26, Th. 4.3], respectively, for further

details. Next, we check the convergence of the approximate kernel deﬁned by σ1,ǫ.

Lemma 4.8 Let d ≥ 3. For any d/(d − 1) < q < ∞, we have:

Proof. We remind the reader that the convolution by |x|1−d is associated to the
Fourier transform of the operator with symbol 1/|ξ|, see [26, Th. 5.9]. The convolution
of radially symmetric functions is radially symmetric too. For d ≥ 3, we compute as

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ZRd

where C > 0 depends on p and d only. Finally we remark that 0 ≤ θǫ(x)+1
|x|d−1 .
By coming back to Lemma 4.7, we deduce that there exists a constant ˜C > 0 such that

|x|d−1 ≤ 2

holds for any g ∈ Lr(Rd), with 1/r = (d + 1)/d − 1/p > 1/d, r > 1. Therefore, by
duality, it means that Oǫ converges to 0 in Lq(Rd) for any d/(d − 1) < q < ∞.
Proof of Theorem 4.2. From now on, we restrict to the case of space dimension d =
3. Compared to the previous Section, additional diﬃculties come from the dependence
of the form function σ1 with respect to ǫ so that deducing uniform estimates from the
energy conservation is not direct.
Step 1. Establishing uniform estimates.

We start by observing that fǫ is bounded in L∞(0,∞; Lp(R3 × R3)) for any 1 ≤

p ≤ ∞, since

kfǫ(t,·)kLp(R3×R3) = kf0,ǫkLp(R3×R3).

Φ0,ǫ(t, x) =(cid:18)σ1,ǫ ∗ZRn eΨǫ(t,·, y)σ2(y) dy(cid:19) (x).
Like in the previous Section, eΨǫ stands for the solution of the free linear wave equation

with wave speed 1/ǫ and initial data Ψ0,ǫ and Ψ1,ǫ. Firstly, we establish a bound for

Tǫ(t) =ZR3

|Sǫ(t)| ≤ kqkL1([0,∞))kσ1,ǫ ∗ ρǫk2

Let us set

The Hölder inequality allows us to estimate kρǫkL6/5(R3) ≤ kρǫk7/12

kρǫkL5/3(R3) ≤ C(2, 3)kfǫk2/5

bining these inequalities, we arrive at

(28)

L5/3(R3). Com-

for a certain constant C > 0, which does not depend on ǫ. Therefore, we obtain

kσ1,ǫ ∗ ρǫkL2(R3) ≤ C(cid:0)E kin
(cid:1)1/4,
ǫ k1/2
|Sǫ(t)| ≤ C 2kqkL1([0,∞))kE kin

(29)

Secondly, we estimate the term involving Φ0,ǫ:

is dominated by

kσ1,ǫ ∗ ρǫkL∞(0,t;L2(R3))keΨǫkL∞(R+;L2(Rd;L2n/(n−2)(Rn)))kσ2kL2n/(n+2)(Rn).

Using (22) and (29), we get

|Tǫ(t)| ≤ C′(cid:0)E kin

ǫ

(t)(cid:1)1/4(cid:0)E vib
0,ǫ(cid:1)1/2

where the constant C′ > 0 does not depend on ǫ. It remains to discuss how (H7)–(H8)
implies a uniform estimate on the initial state. Note that Sǫ(0) = 0. Hence, by using
(H8), we are led to

Going back to the interpolation inequalities, it follows that ρǫ is bounded in L∞(0,∞; L1∩

ǫLǫ(fǫ)(cid:17) · ∇vfǫ = 0.

We start by establishing that ∇vfǫ · ∇xΦ0,ǫ = ∇v · (fǫ∇xΦ0,ǫ) converges to 0 at least
in the sense of distributions.

It is clear, with Lemma 4.4, thateρǫ inherits from ρǫ the uniform estimate L∞(0,∞; L1∩
L5/3(R3)). We also denote E(x) = 1

in R3. Note that ∇xE(x) = − x
4π|x|3 . Bearing in mind Lemma 4.8, the self–consistent

| · |2(cid:17) − ∇xEi ∗eρǫ(t, x) + ∇xE ∗eρǫ(t, x).

In the right hand side, the Lr norm of the ﬁrst term is dominated by keρǫkL∞([0,∞;L1(R3))(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:2)...(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:13)Lr(R3),

hence, owing to Lemma Lemma 4.8 it tends to 0 as ǫ → 0 in L∞(0,∞; Lr(R3)) for any
3/2 < r < ∞. Next, Lemma 4.7 tells us that

Therefore, adapting the reasoning made in the previous sections, we deduce that we can
extract a subsequence, such that, for any trial function χ ∈ Lp′
(R3×R3), 1/p′+1/p = 1,
1 < p < ∞,

∇xE ∗eρǫ is bounded in L∞(0,∞; L15/4(R3)).

Clearly, for any ζ ∈ C∞c (R3), δǫ ∗ δǫ ∗ ζ converges to ζ in Lq(R3), 5/2 ≤ q < ∞, and in

Let us denote by Iǫ(t), IIǫ(t) and IIIǫ(t) the three integrals in the right hand side. By
using Lemma 4.4 and the available estimates, we obtain, for any 0 ≤ t ≤ T < ∞

ρ(t − √ǫs, x)ζ(x) dx(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) |q(s)| ds

while a direct application of the Lebesgue theorem shows that, for any 0 < t ≤ T < ∞

Lemma 4.7 implies that ∇xE ∗ eρǫ is bounded in L∞(0, T ; L15/4(R3)). For µ > 0, we
introduce the cut–oﬀ function eθµ(x) = θ(x/µ). Then we split

deduce that (a suitable subsequence of) ∇xE ∗ eρǫ converges to ∇xE ∗ ρ a. e. and

is compactly supported and converges to RR3 fǫ∇vχ dv weakly in any Lq((0, T ) × R3).
(In fact this convergence, as well as ρǫ → ρ can be shown to hold strongly, by applying
