The complete characterisation of the charge transport in a mesoscopic device is provided by the
Full Counting Statistics (FCS) Pt(m), describing the amount of charge Q = me transmitted during
the time t. Although numerous systems have been theoretically characterized by their FCS, the
experimental measurement of the distribution function Pt(m) or its moments ⟨Qn⟩ are rare and
often plagued by strong back-action. Here, we present a strategy for the measurement of the FCS,
more speciﬁcally its characteristic function χ(λ) and moments ⟨Qn⟩, by a qubit with a set of diﬀerent
couplings λj , j = 1, . . . , k, . . . k+p, k = ⌈n~2⌉, p ≥ 0, to the mesoscopic conductor. The scheme involves
multiple readings of Ramsey sequences at the diﬀerent coupling strengths λj and we ﬁnd the optimal
distribution for these couplings λj as well as the optimal distribution Nj of N = ∑ Nj measurements
among the diﬀerent couplings λj . We determine the precision scaling for the moments ⟨Qn⟩ with
the number N of invested resources and show that the standard quantum limit can be approached
when many additional couplings p ≫ 1 are included in the measurement scheme.

INTRODUCTION

e.g.,

Traditionally, electronic transport through a device is
characterized by the current and its noise. Within meso-
scopic physics, Landauer’s scattering matrix approach1
provides a very physical and straightforward technique
for the calculation of the average current1–4 and noise5–9,
as well as higher moments. The quantity which fully
characterizes the random process of charge transport is
given by the so-called Full Counting Statistics (FCS),

device during a ﬁxed time t.10 The ﬁrst calculation11 of

telling what charge Q = me is transmitted through the
the probability distribution function Pt(m) for the FCS

goes back to 1992 and was quickly developed further12–14.
Various generalizations and applications have been pro-
posed,
the current noise in a normal-metal–
superconductor point contact15, the electron transfer be-
tween superconductors16, charge pumping17 and charge
transfer18 in the Coulomb blockade regime, the extension
to energy-dependent scatterers19, the statistical proper-
ties of the persistent current in nanostructures20, or the
ﬂuctuations in the heat current in a quantum conductor21
or between two superconductors22, to name just a few of
the numerous theoretical studies. At the same time, there
are only very few experiments measuring higher-order
correlators23–25 and one set of experiments measuring
directly the statistics26–29. Unfortunately, measurement
back-action is substantial in all of these experiments and
a non-invasive measurement of the Full Counting Statis-
tics remains to be done. An early suggestion, formulated
on the level of a Gedankenexperiment and involving a
spin14 has later given way to a more concrete proposal
based on charge- or ﬂux-qubits30. However, a speciﬁc
protocol how such a qubit is used in an optimal fashion
is missing and it is the purpose of the present paper to
close this gap.

cumulants can be obtained from the generating func-

The distribution function Pt(m) and its moments or
tion χt(λ), the Fourier transform of Pt(m), χt(λ) =
∑m Pt(m) exp(imλ). Here, λ not only represents a com-

pact variable in the Fourier transform—in its physical
role it appears as the coupling constant between the
transported charge and the qubit detector (here, we have
in mind any qubit that couples to the charge either in-
ductively or capacitively). The basic quantity we are

derivatives with respect to λ. The latter deﬁne the mo-

interested in then is the generating function χ(λ) and its
ments (or cumulants) of the distribution function P(m)
(here and below we drop the time-index t on Pt(m) and
χt(λ)). The issue is to ﬁnd the generating functions

from measured data. This involves a simple protocol on
the qubit with preparation, measurement, and a binary
readout—the probabilities P± for the binary outcomes

+ or − at ﬁxed λ then allow for a statistical estimate
˜χ(λ) of the generating function χ(λ). Evaluating ˜χ(λ)
for various values λ = λj then allows for the determina-
λ ˜χ(λ) via ﬁnite diﬀerence formulas,
from which estimates for the moments ⟨Qn⟩ or cumu-

lants can be obtained. The main question we want to
answer in this paper then is: given a total of N mea-
surements, what is the optimal way to carry out these
measurements? In particular, what number and distri-
bution of grid points λj shall be chosen, how should the
N measurements be distributed among the grid points,
what accuracy can be achieved, and how does the pre-
cision of the result scale with the number N of invested
resources or measurements?

tion of derivatives ∂n

In Sec. II below, we will ﬁrst describe the measurement
protocol providing estimates for the real and imaginary

parts of the characteristic function χ(λ) and analyze the

statistical distribution (or precision) of the measured re-
sults. The moments of transferred charge involve higher-

order derivatives of the characteristic function χ(λ) and

section III is devoted to their construction out of mea-
sured values of χ through ﬁnite-diﬀerence formulas. The
choice of grid-points in these ﬁnite-diﬀerence formulas in-
terferes with the statistical errors from the measurements
and one has to ﬁnd the optimal grid and measurement
strategy to minimize the total error for the charge mo-
ments; this task is discussed in Sec. III A for an equidis-
tant set of coupling strengths and in Sec. III B for a non-
equidistant set of grid points. The optimal measurement
strategy involves a non-equidistant set of points and we
ﬁnd the optimal distribution of the number of measure-
ments as well as the precision scaling with the total num-
ber N of measurements. Speciﬁc results in the form of
tables are given for the measurement of the third-order
In section IV we present a summary,
emphasize our main results, and add some concluding
remarks on the use of diﬀerent types of qubits and the
relation to quantum counting31,32.

The Full Counting Statistics of a conductor can be de-

m particles (electrons) in a given time t (in the following
we drop the index t). The discrete probability distribu-

scribed through the set of probabilities Pt(m) to transmit
tion P(m) can be characterised by a continuous generat-
ing function χ(λ)=∑m P(m)eimλ. Given the generating
function χ(λ), one can ﬁnd all moments of the transmit-

ted charge (with the charge Q measured in units of e),

In order to ﬁnd the above quantities in an experiment,
we consider a qubit locally interacting with the conductor

as described by the Hamiltonian ˆHint = (̵hλ~e)ˆσz ˆI(x, t),
where ˆI(x, t) is the electric current operator in the con-

ductor providing the transmitted charge at a position x
behind the scatterer, see Fig. 1 for an illustration. Such a
linear coupling is appropriate when the interaction point
x resides away from the scattering region in the conduc-
tor, see Bachmann et al.33. The qubit–current interac-
tion leads to a rotation of the qubit state around the

ted charge. Consider a standard Ramsey sequence of

z-axis by an angle ϕ = mλ, where m is the transmit-
qubit rotations ˆR(ϕ) = ˆUy(−π~2) ˆUz(ϕ) ˆUy(π~2), where
ˆU⃗n(α) = ˆ1 cos(α~2)− i⃗n ⋅ ˆ⃗σ sin(α~2), where the ﬁrst and
last rotations describe ±π~2 rotations around the y-axis
an initial qubit-state  ↑⟩ (with σz = 1), one arrives at the

and the intermediate rotation is due to the interaction
with the conductor. Applying this Ramsey sequence to

(4)

The exponential damping in Eq. (4) accounts for the ﬁ-
nite dephasing time τϕ of the qubit that we may model
through a stochastic Gaussian H-ﬁeld. Such a ﬁnite de-
phasing time τϕ ultimately limits the time t during which

the FCS Pt(m) can be measured. For a particular run
tribution P(m), hence, the probabilities for the two ﬁnal

of the Ramsey sequence, the random number m of trans-
mitted charges is unknown but governed by the FCS dis-

qubit states can be found by averaging over m,

These probabilities are conveniently expressed through
the real part of the FCS characteristic function,

Hence, repeating the Ramsey sequence N ≫ 1 times and
observing N± ﬁnal outcomes with σz = ±1, one can di-

for a given dimensionless interaction parameter λ,

where the tilde ˜χ(λ) refers to a statistical estimate of

sequence are not perfect, what modiﬁes the statistical
analysis of the data. Let us consider a non-perfect Ram-

tive Ramsey sequence ˆR′(ϕ) = ˆUx(−π~2) ˆUz(ϕ) ˆUx(π~2)
In a realistic situation, the π~2 pulses in the Ramsey
sey sequence ˆR(ϕ) = ˆUy(−π~2+ δ′) ˆUz(ϕ) ˆUy(π~2− δ) with
probabilities P±(λ) in Eq. (6) are modiﬁed,

P±(λ) =
The imperfect π~2 pulses aﬀect the result in two ways,

i) an eﬀective decrease of the visibility factor, e−t~τϕ →

Note that the uncertainty in the dephasing time shows
up in the ﬁnal results with a small power αn,p, see, e.g.,
Eq. (29). In the following, we will assume perfect pulses
with δ = 0 = δ′.

Next, we derive the statistical bounds for the estima-
tion of ˜χ. The experimental outcomes N± are distributed

according to a binomial distribution, P(N+, N−) =
N [P+(λ)]N+[P−(λ)]N− . As follows from Eq. (6) this
x = exp(−t~τϕ)Reχ(λ) or x = exp(−t~τϕ)Imχ(λ). Hence,
by virtue of Bayes theorem and observing a particular
set N± of results σz = ±1, one can obtain an estimate
of the posterior distribution function for the unknown

σz = −1 increases and the distribution (10) detaches from

tion. Rather, the distribution (10) approaches the stan-
dard Gaussian form when 1 − ˜x becomes larger than σ,
which is the case for N− ≫ 1 (using either of the above
estimates for ˜x and σ). In the following, we assume that
N is large enough, such that the Gaussian approxima-

tion for the random variable x = e−τ ~τϕReχ(λ) provides

a good description at any coupling strength λ > 0.

reduces the number of points where χ(λ) has to be mea-
sured. Indeed, using Eq. (15), one shows that wλ = w−λ
for even n and wλ = −w−λ when n is odd. In addition,
χ(0) = 1 and one needs to measure χ(λ) only at the k + p

characteristic function χ(λ), the even (odd) derivatives

of the characteristic function can be expressed through
its real (imaginary) parts, respectively,

Having established the statistical error in the estimates

a second type of error arising due to approximation given
by the ﬁnite diﬀerence formulas. E.g., choosing the grid
points λ ∈ Λ close to the origin λ = 0 decreases the er-
ror in the ﬁnite diﬀerence approximation (since the re-
mainder in the approximation (14) is of order λn+p+2),
however, the statistical error Eq. (19) grows due to the

In the following, we approximate v2k−1(λ) ≈ eτ ~τϕ and

Finding the n-th order moment of the transmitted

charge requires measuring Reχ(λ) or Imχ(λ) in at

least at k diﬀerent values of the coupling constant λ.
Analysing the scaling of the net error (23) with respect
to the number N of measurements, one notes that using
only a minimal number of points, i.e., p = 0, produces a

small scaling exponent αn,0 = 1~(n + 2) and hence reach-

ing a good precision implies a large number N of mea-
surements. In order to achieve a shorter overall duration
of the experiment one needs to add more measurement
points p > 0; this strategy then allows to reach the stan-

dard quantum limit δQn ∝ 1~√N at large p.

Next, let us estimate the optimal coupling parameter
¯λ0 as given by Eq. (25). Assuming a driven (or non-
equilibrium) charge transport, the higher moments scale

Optimizing the proposed measurement scheme then re-
quires a weak coupling λ between the conductor and the
qubit, implying that the qubit is typically rotated by an
angle ϕ ∼ ¯Q¯λ0 ∼ 1 in the xy-plane of the Bloch sphere
during one Ramsey sequence (given the smallness of the
exponent, we drop the factor N −αn,p~2(p+1)). This re-
sult is quite natural, since at large couplings λ the qubit
would perform multiple 2π-rotations which cannot be dis-
tinguished by the proposed measurement scheme.

third-order charge moment Q3 (n = 3, k = 2) for an
equidistant grid with a diﬀerent number of points 2 + p,
p = 0, 1, . . . . The corresponding weight factors in Eq.
(20), scaling exponent α3,p and scaling factors A3,p and
B3,p are presented in Table I for p = 0, 1, 2, 3. Note that
the numericals A3,p and B3,p are all of order unity.

The weights κj in the ﬁnite-diﬀerence approximation
assume higher absolute values near the origin (small j)
and are almost vanishing at large j. Therefore, most mea-
surements have to be done for the ﬁrst few grid points

near the origin λ = 0; the relative number rj = Nj~N of
ment as χ(0) = 1).

measurements [as they follow from Eq. (18)], are summa-
rized in Table II (the point λ0 = 0 requires no measure-

B. Non-equidistant grids

An equidistant set of grid points may not provide the

optimal result, i.e., the smallest error δQn. Hence, let

us parametrize a non-equidistant set of couplings Λ =

λ0{1, ν2, ν3, . . . , νk+p} by the minimal coupling λ0 and an
ordered set of k + p constants ν1 = 1 < ν2 < ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ < νk+p.
According to Eq. (15), the ﬁnite-diﬀerence weights wλj

Repeating the above analysis, one can minimize the sum
of statistical and approximation errors as a function of
the coupling strength parameter λ0. The results (23)
and (25) then hold true for the general grid Λ with the
replacement of the coeﬃcients νj = j in Eq. (22) by
the distance coeﬃcients νj. Dropping the requirement
of equidistant grid points, one may attempt to further
optimize the factor An,p in Eq. (23) for given n and p.
Although we have not been able to ﬁnd an analytic ex-
pression for the coeﬃcients νj, we have performed a nu-
merical optimization of An,p for n = 3 and p = 0, 1, 2, 3 as
a function of νj with the results shown in Table III (the
relative number rj of measurements remain those given
in Table II).

C. Coupling strength sensitivity

Another experimental limitation is due to imperfect
knowledge of the coupling strengths λj . Assuming an

Note that the measurement involving the optimal grid is
less sensitive to the errors in λj as compared with the
measurement based on the equidistant grid and requires
less measurements ¯N . For example, the measurement

with p = 3 provides a scaling exponent α3,3 = 4~11 and

D. Charge cumulants

In addition to the charge moments one might be inter-

ested in the charge cumulants Kn =⟪ ˆQn⟫; the latter can
Qm with m ≤ n, for example,

be expressed through a combination of charge moments

K3 =Q3 − 3Q2Q1 + 2Q3

1.

(39)

Given a grid Λn,p = {λ1, . . . , λk+p} of k + p measuring
points, one has to measure all charge moments Qm with
charge moment Qn, hence, this measurement has to be

m ≤ n. The most imprecise measurement in the above
combination is given by the measurement of the highest

fully optimized with respect to the number of measure-
ment proportions rj as well as optimal coupling strengths
λj. As follows from the Eq. (29), the optimal value of λ0

for each Qm measurement with m ≤ n is given by
∼ Bm,p+n−m  ¯Q −1 g(ǫ)vm√N 1~(2n+2p−m+2)
The precision scaling in N involves only small exponents
1~(2n + 2p − m + 2) and thus all couplings ¯λ(m)
are of
the same order as ¯λ(n)
. The lower charge moments with
m < n then can be measured using the same grid Λn,p and
hence the same data ˜χ(λj) with diﬀerent weights w(n)
.
Finally, as the main contribution to the measurement
error of Kn originates from the measurement error of the

largest charge moment, we have

IV. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have derived an optimized strategy

the Full Counting Statistics) in the random charge trans-
fer across a mesoscopic device. These moments appear

for measuring the charge moments Qn =⟨ ˆQn⟩ (and hence
as derivatives of the generating function χ(λ), which can
sey sequences at couplings λ. The derivatives of χ(λ)

be measured with the help of a qubit performing Ram-

can be determined with the help of ﬁnite-diﬀerence for-
mulas involving a set of measurements at diﬀerent cou-
plings λj, j = 1, . . . k + p, with a minimal number of cou-
plings k = ⌈n~2⌉ and p ≥ 0 additional grid-points. Given

a total number N of Ramsey sequences, we have found
the optimal distribution Nj of such measurements among
the diﬀerent couplings λj . For an equidistant grid, we
have found the optimal grid separation ¯λ0 and the expo-
nent α of the precision scaling, δQn ∝ N −α. The typi-
cal coupling ¯λ0 then generates a rotation ϕ ∼ 2π on the
passage of the average charge ¯Q during a Ramsey se-
quence, ¯Q¯λ0 ∼ ϕ~2π ∼ 1. The precision exponent αn,p

depends on the order n of the moment and the number

7

p of additional grid points. Higher moments come with

a poor scaling αn,0 = 1~(n + 2) for the minimal grid with
αsql = 1~2. The best set of couplings λj is not equidis-

p = 0. On the other hand, choosing a large p is beneﬁ-
cial and allows to approach the standard quantum limit

tant; unfortunately, ﬁnding this grid requires a numerical
optimization. Such an optimization, as well as the deter-
mination of all other relevant quantities and numericals,
has been done for the measurement of the third-order

moment Q3. Another requirement is the precise knowl-
ments to a value ¯N ∝ 1~ǫ2

edge of the couplings λj, as a relative imprecision ǫλ of
the couplings λj limits the number N of useful measure-
λ. An interesting observation is
that the non-equidistant optimized grid provides a bet-
ter precision with fewer measurements as compared with
the equidistant grid, although the diﬀerence is small, see
Eqs. (37) and (38).

Let us also discuss a few more subtle issues related to
the measurement of the full counting statistics. First,
we point out that the measured probability function or
correlators depends on the type of qubit. E.g., a ﬂux
qubit measures the passage of directed charge (plus for
right-moving, minus for left-moving) and hence quantiﬁes
the statistics of the net transferred charge. On the other
hand, a charge qubit accumulates the signal from passing
charge independent of its direction of motion and hence
provides a characterization of the total charge transferred
across the detector (in any direction); both quantities
are measured perfectly ﬁne with the above recipe.
It
is then the experimenter who has to decide about the
appropriate type of qubit that measures the quantity of
interest.

A second issue is the location of the qubit detector,
close or far away from the scattering region at x = 0.
This question relates to some fundamental concerns that
appeared very early on in the context of extending the
transport characteristic beyond the noise correlator. In
fact, diﬀerent results have been obtained for the 3-rd or-
der cumulant, once the quantum binomial expression11

or when placing the qubit near the scatterer35, while the

⟪Q3⟫q ∝ −2T 2(1−T) when no time-ordering was imposed
classical binomial result12,14 ⟪Q3⟫c ∝ T(1 − T)(1 − 2T)

has been found when time ordering was applied as pre-
scribed through the inclusion of a spin detector into the
description. The problem has been resolved recently33
with the demonstration that the classical binomial result
applies everywhere, far away as well as close to the scat-
terer, at least for the case of a spin or ﬂux qubit device.
Another remark concerns the relation of measuring the
FCS to the problem of quantum counting31,32, where
a qubit register of K qubits with coupling strengths

ted during a time t. Repeating the measurement many

λj = π~2j−1, j = 1, . . . , K can be used to ﬁnd the pre-
times and averaging then allows to ﬁnd the FCS Pt(m) as

well. However, in this case, the strongest coupling λ1 = π
rotates the qubit j = 1 by π on passage of a single elec-
tron, so much stronger couplings are required than in the

information than needed if the goal is the measurement
