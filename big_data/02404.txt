Abstract We analyse eight XMM-Newton observations of the bright Narrow-Line
Seyfert 1 galaxy Arakelian 564 (Ark 564). These observations, separated by ∼ 6 days,
allow us to look for correlations between the simultaneous UV emission (from the Optical
Monitor) with not only the X-ray ﬂux but also with the different X-ray spectral param-
eters. The X-ray spectra from all the observations are found to be adequately ﬁtted by a
double Comptonization model where the soft excess and the hard X-ray power law are
represented by thermal Comptonization in a low temperature plasma and hot corona, re-
spectively. Apart from the ﬂuxes of each component, the hard X-ray power law index is
found to be variable. These results suggest that the variability is associated with changes
in the geometry of the inner region. The UV emission is found to be variable and well
correlated with the high energy index while the correlations with the ﬂuxes of each com-
ponent are found to be weaker. Using viscous time-scale arguments we rule out the possi-
bility that the UV variation is due to ﬂuctuating accretion rate in the outer disc. If the UV
variation is driven by X-ray reprocessing, then our results indicate that the strength of the
X-ray reprocessing depends more on the geometry of the X-ray producing inner region
rather than on the X-ray luminosity alone.

1 INTRODUCTION

Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) emit over a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum and their spectra
show strong optical/UV emission lines which are not present in the spectrum of a normal galaxy. AGN
are believed to harbour a supermassive black hole (SMBH) of mass ∼ 106 − 109M⊙. The accretion
of matter on to the SMBH is the major source of radiation in AGN, and they can outshine the stellar
emission of the host galaxy (e.g. Peterson 1997; Beckmann & Shrader 2012). According to the standard
model of AGN, the matter accreted from the host galaxy forms an accretion disc surrounding the central
black hole and the spectrum emitted from the disc peaks in the optical/UV band. Furthermore, there
is a hot corona above the disc which inverse Compton scatters the disc photons resulting in X-ray
emission. The broadband X-ray emission is one of the fundamental characteristics deﬁning AGN (e.g.
Beckmann & Shrader (2012)).

A signiﬁcant property of AGN is their continuum variability over the entire electromagnetic spec-
trum. AGN, in general, show strong X-ray variability and a subset of AGN called Narrow Line Seyfert 1
(NLS1) shows extreme variability (e.g. Boller et al. (1996)). Relationship between emission in different

2

bands provides important insights into the nature of AGN. A number of previous studies have shown
that X-ray and optical/UV variations in AGN are well correlated (Nandra et al., 1998; Edelson et al.,
1996; Smith & Vaughan, 2007; McHardy et al., 2014). There are two basic models to explain the UV
variability in AGN: the UV variability could be due to accretion rate variation in the outer disc or it
could be due to X-ray reprocessing (e.g. McHardy et al. (2014)). In the ﬁrst case, the UV ﬂux variation
can provide information about accretion rate variation while in the second case, the correlation between
the soft/hard X-ray component and the UV emission can reveal which X-ray spectral component has the
greater affect on the outer disc.

A multiwavelength campaign undertaken by Edelson et al. (1996) observed a strong correlation be-
tween the X-ray, UV and optical variability in the Seyfert 1 (Sy 1) galaxy NGC 4151, with no detectable
lags. The UV observations were taken with a sampling interval of ∼0.05 d while the X-ray observa-
tions were taken twice per day. The obtained results suggest that UV emission in the source is produced
by the reprocessing of primary X-rays. A recent study by McHardy et al. (2014) investigates the rela-
tionship between the X-ray, UV and optical variability of the Sy 1 galaxy NGC 5548. They analysed
554 Swift (XRT & UVOT) observations of the source, typically taken every two days, over a period
of 750 d. The study strengthens the short time-scale correlations between X-ray and UV/optical bands
and the lag measurements of this object also lead to the conclusion that UV/optical variability is due to
the reprocessing of X-rays. Shemmer et al. (2003) studied the X-ray−optical correlation of the NLS1
galaxy NGC 4051 based on the data available from 2000 May-July observations. The optical data were
retrieved from Wise Observatory and X-ray data from RXTE. They obtained RXTE data from 251 obser-
vations with an interval of 6 h. They conclude that the observed X-ray−optical correlation in the source
can be explained as a combined effect of X-ray reprocessing and the propagation of perturbations from
the outer disc to the X-ray emitting region.

In this work, we study the source Arakelian 564 (Ark 564) which is an X-ray bright NLS 1
(Brandt et al., 1994; Vaughan et al., 1999) found in the nearby universe with redshift z = 0.0247. It
is a well studied source which is known to accrete at super-Eddington rate (Mullaney et al., 2009).
Earlier studies have shown that the high energy spectrum of Ark 564 is characterised by a steep power
law (Vignali et al., 2004; Matsumoto et al., 2004). Vignali et al. (2004) detected absorption correspond-
ing to the O VII K-edge (∼ 0.73 keV) in two different XMM-Newton observations (2000 & 2001) of
the source. They also obtained evidence for signiﬁcant X-ray variability of the object both at low and
high energies. The spectral variability analysis of Ark 564 was carried out by Brinkmann et al. (2007)
with the longest exposure observation available from XMM-Newton. They found that both the soft and
hard X-ray ﬂux are highly variable on short time-scales. The cross-correlation analysis of light curves
showed some delay in the observation of hard band photons with respect to soft band photons. The
high energy photon index Γ was also variable and it was found to be leading the variations in soft and
hard energy bands. A previous study using ASCA observations by Bian & Zhao (2003) determined the
relations between hard X-ray variability, photon index Γ and Eddington ratio ˙m of a sample of AGN,
including Ark 564. They found that the X-ray variability and central black hole mass MBH are strongly
anti-correlated while a weak correlation exists for the variability and ˙m. This means that small value of
MBH is responsible for the variability of NLS1s. The study also discovered a strong correlation between
Γ and ˙m.

Smith & Vaughan (2007) examined the X-ray and optical variability of Ark 564 and seven other
Sy 1 galaxies over a period of ∼1 d. The source was variable in X-rays, but not in the optical band. But
another study by Shemmer et al. (2001) investigated the optical−UV−X-ray connection of Ark 564
over a longer period of time of ∼50 d. It was a two year long multiwavelength monitoring program in
which the X-ray observations were covered with RXTE and ASCA while the UV observations with HST.
They observed a signiﬁcant correlation of the continua, where the X-ray continuum was followed by
UV with a time lag of 0.4 d which in turn was followed by the optical band by ∼2 d. The soft X-ray ﬂux
was also found to be well correlated with the hard band ﬂux with zero time lag. Rapid X-ray variations
of .1 d was observed in the source, but the mean ﬂux was constant on time-scales >30 d.

A study has been carried out by Dewangan et al. (2007) of the soft excess emission from the NLS1
galaxies Ark 564 and Mrk 1044. They argued that the soft excess emission from Ark 564 can be ex-

plained by considering a two-component corona in the source. According to their model, the geometry of
the corona is such that it consists two different physical regions, one being optically thick and cool while
the other a high-temperature, optically thin region. The hot corona extends above the low-temperature
corona while the latter is coupled to the inner part of the accretion disc. The optical/UV photons emit-
ted from the accretion disc are Comptonized by the optically thick corona leading to the soft X-ray
emission. The geometry suggests that a fraction of these scattered photons again get inverse Compton
scattered by the optically thin corona giving rise to the hard X-ray spectrum.

In this work, we examine the correlation between the X-ray and UV emission from Ark 564, by us-
ing eight XMM-Newton observations in 2011. The data from these observations have already been anal-
ysed to study the observed time lag between the soft and hard X-ray emissions (Legg et al., 2012) and
the frequency-dependent Fe K lags (Kara et al., 2013). Legg et al. (2012) detected a delayed (∼ 1000s)
hard X-ray emission in the 4−7.5 keV with respect to a ﬂaring in the soft X-ray band (0.4−1 keV). In
view of these results Giustini et al. (2015) reported on the X-ray spectral properties using XMM-Newton
and Suzaku observations of Ark 564 by analysing the time-averaged, ﬂux-selected and time-resolved
spectra. They interpreted the delayed hard excess component as the reprocessing of soft photon ﬂares
Compton up-scattered in a medium situated at 10−100 of gravitational radii. However these studies
have been limited to the variations in the X-ray band only. Moreover, most of the previous UV/X-ray
correlation studies of the source have concentrated on the variation of total X-ray counts or ﬂux with
that of the UV band. The high quality X-ray spectral data available by XMM-Newton provide us the op-
portunity to study the variation of different X-ray spectral components with the UV ﬂux. In the present
work, we ﬁt the spectra utilising some physical models to obtain the spectral parameters and then study
the correlation between these parameters and the UV ﬂux.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the observations and data reduction.
We discuss the variability of the source and spectral analysis in Section 3 and Section 4, respectively.
Then we present the correlations in Section 5. Finally, we summarize and discuss our results in Section
6.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

We used eight observations of Ark 564 taken by XMM-Newton between May and July 2011. The details
of these pointed observations are given in Table 1. XMM-Newton has simultaneous X-ray and UV expo-
sures for all these observations. X-ray data from the European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC) pn and
MOS and UV data from the Optical Monitor (OM) were retrieved from the HEASARC archive. The
EPIC-pn camera (Str¨uder et al., 2001) is positioned such that the incoming radiation from the source en-
ters the primary focus unobstructed, but the EPIC-MOS cameras (Turner et al., 2001) can receive only
half of the radiation. The EPIC-pn has large effective area at high energies as well as high quantum
efﬁciency. The pn CCDs are also less susceptible to pile-up during the observations of bright sources.
We therefore focus our analysis on the pn data, where the camera was operated in small window mode
using a thin ﬁlter. OM observations were performed with the UVW2 ﬁlter in the imaging mode. The data
reduction is done with SAS version 14.0 using the updated calibration ﬁles available in July 2015.

The event lists for EPIC-pn are ﬁltered for single and double (PATTERN=4) best quality (FLAG=0)
events in the energy range 0.2−10 keV. To examine the ﬂaring particle background, light-curves are ex-
tracted in the 10−12 keV band for single events. The intervals of ﬂaring background are then removed
from the event list using the threshold rate of 0.1 counts/s obtained from the light curve. The source
spectra were extracted from circular regions of radius 36′′around the centre of the source. The back-
ground spectra were also extracted from two circular regions of 30′′radii on the same chip, but devoid
of source photons. We checked whether any of the observations were affected by pile-up using the SAS
task epatplot. But no signiﬁcant deviation in the pattern distribution was observed in any of them. Then
we rebinned the data with the tool specgroup. While binning we ensured that each bin has a minimum
number of 20 counts. Also the oversampling factor was set to 5 such that there are no more than 5 bins
to cover the energy resolution.

All the Optical Monitor observations were made with UVW2 ﬁlter in the Imaging mode. The SAS
task ‘omichain’ is used to reprocess the OM data, which automatically produces the combined source
list of all the ﬁlters. But there is a chance that the detection algorithm (‘omdetect’) may misidentify the
source as an extended one, yielding incorrect values of count rate. In order to avoid this, omichain is
run with the option ‘omdetectdetectextended=no’ for the detection and photometry to be performed as
on a point source. Then the count rate of the source is obtained form the combined source list of each
observation.

3 UV − X-RAY VARIABILITY

We calculated the UV ﬂux FUV of the source from each observation by multiplying the count rate,
obtained from the combined source list, with the conversion factor 5.71× 10−15 erg cm−2 s−1 ˚A−1
for the UVW2 ﬁlter1. Both EPIC-pn and UVW2 count rates and UVW2 ﬂux values are given in Table 2.
We checked the variability of the source by χ2 analysis, which measures the deviation of the data points
from the best-ﬁt constant. The analysis yielded large χ2 values for FUV and pn count rate (0.3−10 keV),
proving that the source is highly variable in X-ray and UV bands. This is clear from Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.

In order to conﬁrm that the observed variability is not an artifact of the instrument we checked
the variability in FUV of other sources which happened to be in the same ﬁeld of view of all UVW2
observations. Among these 23 sources ﬁve were found to be varying in ﬂux while other sources didn’t

show any sign of variability. Some of the non-variable sources observed in the same ﬁeld of view are
NVSS J224244+293856, NVSS J224252+294533, 2MASX J22425351+2943125 etc.

We have also calculated the fractional rms variability amplitude of both FUV and pn count rate of
Ark 564 and the respective values are ∼0.039 and ∼0.245. This shows that the observed variance in
X-ray count rate is large compared to the UV ﬂux variance.

4 SPECTRAL ANALYSIS

The spectral analysis of EPIC-pn and UVW2 data was done with the XSPEC package (Version 12.8.2).
The χ2 statistic was applied for the spectral ﬁtting and the errors calculated for each parameter corre-
spond to the 90% conﬁdence range, unless otherwise stated.

The template spectral ﬁle and response ﬁles for the OM data were obtained from the XMM-Newton
website2. We used the template ﬁle and the measured count rate to create the spectral ﬁle for the analysis
of UVW2 data.

As an example of how we have systematically done the spectral analysis we report here the anal-
ysis of Observation Number 2 (Observation ID: 0670130301). The same analysis scheme was applied
to the other observations. We started the spectral analysis by ﬁtting the EPIC-pn data, in the energy
range 3 to 10 keV, using powerlaw together with TBabs, the Tuebingen-Boulder ISM absorption model
(Wilms et al., 2000). This model with photon index Γ ∼ 2.3 − 2.5 and the Galactic column density

Figure 2 The variation in X-ray count rate from EPIC-pn in the range 0.3−10 keV. Here, the
vertical error-bars (1σ) are very small. The horizontal solid line corresponds to the constant
best-ﬁt value obtained using χ2 analysis.

NH ﬁxed to 5.41 × 1020cm−2 (Kalberla et al., 2005) provides a reasonable ﬁt for all observations. It
gave a χ2 of 239.66 for 162 degrees of freedom (dof) for the second observation. Some excess emis-
sion features were detected in the range 6.4−7 keV which might be attributed to the ﬂuorescent Fe
emission line. An improvement in ﬁt, ∆χ2 = −24.29, was observed in the second observation, when a
red-shifted Gaussian proﬁle (zgauss) at ∼ 6.6 keV was included. The line appeared to be broad having
a width, σ=0.25+0.61
−0.11 keV. But this broad Gaussian did not ﬁt properly the spectrum of any of the other
observations. When we ﬁxed σ of the line to 0.5 keV, all observations could achieve a good ﬁt statistic.

The deviation of the observed data from the model.

Extrapolation of the model down to 0.3 keV provided a poor ﬁt indicating the presence of soft excess
in the spectrum. We attempted to describe this soft excess with the thermal Comptonization XSPEC
model Nthcomp. In this model, the temperature kTbb of seed photons from the accretion disc (blackbody
or disc blackbody) parameterizes the low energy cut-off, while the high energy roll over is given by the
electron temperature kTe (∼ 160 eV). We assume that the photons from this component are the seed
photons to the second thermal component giving rise to the high energy power law emission. Hence,
we re-analysed the data replacing the powerlaw by introducing the convolution XSPEC model (Simpl)
which transfers a fraction of the seed photons in the input spectrum into a power law (Steiner et al.,
2009). The model yielded an unacceptable ﬁt statistic of χ2/dof=547.48/253. Inspection of the residuals
revealed that the soft part of the spectrum was affected by an absorption feature around 0.7 keV. A better
χ2 = 385.74 for 251 dof was obtained for the same observation, when we ﬁtted the region with a red-
shifted absorption edge model, zedge. Another absorption feature was also found at ∼0.5 keV and it was
modelled using one more zedge. Correspondingly the χ2 was improved by ∆χ2 = −9.92 which clearly
shows the signiﬁcance of including the new absorption feature. We also tried to model these features
using more complex models such as zxipcf and grid22soft and obtained ﬁt statistics comparable to the
phenomenological two edge model. Moreover, the relevant spectral parameters such as the hard and soft
X-ray ﬂuxes and high energy spectral index are not sensitive to the absorption model used. Thus we
proceed with the simple phenomenological model of two edges in this work. For this model, we show
the unfolded spectrum and residuals in Fig. 3.

In order to study the relationship between X-ray and UV emission, we need to ﬁt the spectra si-
multaneously. For this we loaded the UVW2 data along with the pn data and then added the model
ezdiskbb which describes the accretion disc spectrum consisting of multiple blackbody components
(Zimmerman et al., 2005). The model is deﬁned by two parameters, the inner disc temperature kTin

and the norm Ndisk, where Ndisk is determined by the inner disc radius and the inclination of the disc.
Further the effect of interstellar extinction on the source spectrum was taken into account using the
model uvred, based on Seaton’s law (Seaton, 1979). This UV reddening model is valid only in the range
1000−3074 ˚A, and can be used in combination with photoelectric absorption models. The parameter
E(B-V) was determined from the reddening law RV = AV /E(B-V) (Fitzpatrick, 1999) and the AV mag-
nitude of 0.198 was obtained from original SFD98 values assuming RV = 3.1. So the value of E(B-V)
was ﬁxed to 0.064 for all observations. Then we ﬁtted the UVW2 data simultaneously with the EPIC-
pn data by tying the parameter kTin to the kTbb of Nthcomp. This left only the normalisation of the
ezdiskbb model as a free parameter to ﬁt the single UV data point. To ensure that only the outer disc
emission is used to ﬁt the UV data point, we ﬁxed the normalisation of the Comptonization component
at a negligible value for the UV part of the spectrum. The best ﬁt parameters for this model for all the
observations are given in Table 3.

We have also calculated the X-ray ﬂux for each model component in the range 0.3−10 keV using the
XSPEC convolution model cﬂux. The ﬂux corresponding to the model component Simpl was calculated
from the unabsorbed X-ray ﬂux and the Nthcomp ﬂux. It was obtained by subtracting (1 − fsc) times the
Nthcomp ﬂux from the unabsorbed ﬂux. Using the luminosity distance of D=98.5Mpc, by assuming the
cosmological parameters H0=73 km s−1 Mpc−1, Ωm=0.27 and ΩΛ=0.73, we obtained the luminosities
of each component.

The normalisation of the ezdiskbb model, Ndisc is related to the inner disc radius Rin by

where D10kpc is the luminosity distance to the source in units of 10 kpc. i is the inclination angle

accepted value of 1.7. The mass accretion rate can be obtained using (Zimmerman et al., 2005)

where T∗ = Tin/0.488. Several previous studies have estimated the black hole mass of Ark 564 to be
in the range (1.15 − 10)×106M⊙ (e.g. Pounds et al. (2001), Wang & Lu (2001), Bian & Zhao (2003),
Botte et al. (2004), Zhou & Wang (2005), Zhang & Wang (2006)). In this study, we adopt the value
2.61×106 M⊙ (Botte et al., 2004) obtained from stellar velocity dispersions. This allows us to express
the luminosities in terms of the Eddington Luminosity LEdd and the accretion rate in terms of the
Eddington accretion rate,
ηc2 , where η is the efﬁciency factor taken as 0.1. The normalised
luminosities for the different observations are listed in Table 3.

5 UV & X-RAY CORRELATIONS

We investigate the correlation between varying X-ray spectral parameters, luminosities and FUV . We
identify the variable parameters by ﬁtting a constant to the best-ﬁt values obtained from different obser-
vations using χ2 analysis. The reduced χ2 values are listed in Table 4, with the larger reduced χ2 values
corresponding to highly variable parameters. Apart from the luminosities of the X-ray components and
the UV ﬂux, the high energy photon index ΓSimpl is also found to be variable. Hence we restrict our
correlation analysis to these parameters.

Since the nature of the relations between the parameters are unknown we need a non-parametric
method to calculate the correlation. So we use Spearman’s rank-order correlation (Press et al., 1992) to
reveal any correlations. The rank and signiﬁcance of correlations for different parameters are listed in
Table 5. Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show the plots of different parameters for which we ﬁnd signiﬁcant correla-
tions.

In the X-ray domain, the soft excess luminosity LN thcomp is well correlated to the high energy
power law luminosity LSimpl. In fact it seems that Γsimpl is better correlated with LN thcomp than it

is with the high energy luminosity LSimpl, in the sense that the null hypothesis probability p is sig-
niﬁcantly smaller. As we discuss in the next section these correlations are consistent with the double
Comptonization model used for the spectral ﬁtting.

For the UV−X-ray correlations, we note that there is not much evidence for any correlation between
FUV and the X-ray luminosities in the two Comptonization component LN thcomp and LSimpl with
probabilities of p = 0.05 and 0.14. However a strong correlation is seen for FUV and Γsimpl with
p = 0.0009.

6 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

We have analysed the simultaneous X-ray (EPIC-pn) and UV (OM UVW2) data from eight XMM-
Newton observations of Ark 564 taken in 2011. We used the thermal Comptonization models favoured
by Dewangan et al. (2007) for the spectral ﬁtting of the X-ray data. The soft X-ray spectrum (0.3−3 keV)
was modelled by Nthcomp assuming that the UV photons emitted from the accretion disc are
Comptonized by the optically thick corona leading to the soft excess emission. The accretion disc emit-
ting the seed photons is described by the multicolour black body model ezdiskbb. Further, the hard X-ray
power law emission (3−10 keV) is taken into account by the second Comptonization model Simpl which
incorporates the physics of Compton upscattering of soft photons by hot coronal electrons. We report
that this double Comptonization model ﬁts all the eight spectra well.

Eddington luminosity. Left & Middle panels: The variation of hard X-ray luminosity and
hard X-ray photon index with soft X-ray luminosity. Right Panel: The dependence of hard
X-ray photon index on the hard X-ray luminosity.

In the X-ray band, we ﬁnd that the luminosity of the soft Comptonization component Lnthcomp
correlates well with the hard component LSimpl. While there is some evidence that the high energy
index ΓSimpl correlates well with both luminosities, there is a seemingly stronger correlation between
ΓSimpl and Lnthcomp in the sense that null hypothesis probability is smaller. There have been several
studies which have shown that the high energy index is correlated with the X-ray ﬂux (e.g.Dewangan
(2002), Vaughan & Edelson (2001), Perola et al. (1986)). Recently, Sarma et al. 2015 have studied the
index versus ﬂux variation for Mrk 335 and Ark 564 and have reported that while the correlation exists
for both sources, there is signiﬁcantly more scatter for Ark 564. Our results are broadly consistent with

12

Ezhikode et. al.

their ﬁnding and perhaps gives an explanation for the difference between the two sources. Also the
correlations obtained here are consistent with the double Comptonization model used.

There is little evidence for any correlation between the UV ﬂux and the hard component luminosity
with null hypothesis probability of p = 0.14. There is a hint of a correlation between the UV ﬂux and
the soft X-ray component luminosity with p = 0.05. However, the UV ﬂux is strongly correlated to the
photon index ΓSimpl.

We can interpret the correlation between UV and X-ray emissions in two different ways. One in-
terpretation is that the variation in UV emission could be due to the accretion rate ﬂuctuation. So as
the UV ﬂux varies, it provides a way to measure the accretion rate ˙m as a fraction of the Eddington
rate and it is found to vary from ∼3.7 to ∼4.4. However, one can estimate from the accretion rate that
the measured UV emission should mostly arise from the outer disc at a distance of ∼ 770Rg, where
Rg is the Schwarzschild radius. At this radius the viscous time-scale is tvisc ∼ 9 years, which is much
longer than the 6 day variability seen; more importantly, the variation in accretion rate could not have
propagated to the inner regions in such short time-scales. We can further estimate that less than 2% of
the UV ﬂux would arise from radii ∼30Rg. If the ﬂux variation at those radii is very large, it may give
rise to the ∼1% variation seen in the UV. However, even at ∼ 30Rg the viscous time-scale is too long at
∼ 61 days. Moreover, the accretion rate inferred from this interpretation is signiﬁcantly higher than the
Eddington rate and hence unlikely. Thus, it seems that the UV emission, or at least its variability cannot
arise due to accretion rate ﬂuctuations.

The second possibility is that the UV ﬂux variation is due to the reprocessing of X-rays. In such
a case our results indicate that the soft X-ray emitting region and ΓSimpl are more important in de-
termining the X-ray irradiation than the X-ray luminosity itself. We note that recently Pal et al. (2016)
have studied the UV-X-ray correlation on much shorter 20 ksec time-scales and have come to a similar
conclusion that the geometry of the inner X-ray producing region may be playing an important role in
determining the UV emission.

Though we have not used the blurred reﬂection model (e.g., Fabian et al. 2002) to describe the
soft X-ray excess and the broad iron line observed from Ark 564, the model can be tested against
the observed correlations. In the blurred reﬂection model, the soft excess and the broad iron line are
physically the same spectral component, and hence these two features must be strongly correlated. The
presence of the broad iron line strongly suggests some contribution of the blurred reﬂection to the soft
X-ray excess. Indeed, the observation of reverberation soft lags of ∼ 100 s in Ark 564 by Kara et al.
(2013) clearly demonstrate the presence of blurred reﬂection in the soft (0.3−1 keV) band. However, the
ﬁndings of soft leads in Ark 564 (Dewangan, 2002; Kara et al., 2013) suggest contribution of additional
spectral component in the soft band. In our analysis, the broad iron line does not appear to follow
the strongly variable soft X-ray excess emission. Illumination of the hard X-ray power law component
should not only result in the blurred reﬂection (the soft excess, broad iron line and the hump in the
∼ 20 − 40 keV) but also in the reprocessed emission in the UV band. The correlation between FUV
and LSimpl may result from the reprocessing of the coronal X-ray emission in the disc. However, the
similar variability amplitudes of the soft excess and the hard X-ray emission is difﬁcult to explain in the
reﬂection model in which a compact corona along the symmetrical axis illuminates the disc. In such a
model, due to the bending of light, the reﬂected emission that includes the soft excess and the iron line
is much less variable than the illuminating power law (Miniutti & Fabian, 2004). Thus, the observed
strong soft X-ray excess entirely is unlikely to be the reﬂected emission.

Our results are based on eight observations separated by ∼6 days and clearly there is a need for
a larger number of such observations to verify these interpretations. Further long term simultaneous
monitoring of UV and X-ray emissions over different time-scales can give us more insight into the
variability of the source. Also the results can be compared with correlations obtained for other AGN.
This may be possible with ASTROSAT which has the Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) for
monitoring the UV emission and the Soft X-ray imaging Telescope (SXT) and the Large Area X-ray
Proportional Counters (LAXPC) for X-ray studies.
