The magnetic, thermodynamic and electrical/thermal transport properties of the

caged-structure quasi-skutterudite Gd3Ir4Sn13 are re-investigated. The magnetiza-

tion M (T ), speciﬁc heat Cp(T ) and the resistivity ρ(T ) reveal a double-phase transi-
tion – at TN 1 ∼ 10 K and at TN 2 ∼ 8.8 K – which was not observed in the previous
report on this compound. The antiferromagnetic transition is also visible in the

thermal transport data, thereby suggesting a close connection between the electronic

and lattice degrees of freedom in this Sn-based quasi-skutterudite. The temperature

dependence of ρ(T ) is analyzed in terms of a power-law for resistivity pertinent to
Fermi liquid picture. Giant, positive magnetoresistance (MR) ≈ 80% is observed
in Gd3Ir4Sn13 at 2 K with the application of 9 T. The giant MR and the double

magnetic transition can be attributed to the quasi-cages and layered antiferromag-

netic structure of Gd3Ir4Sn13 vulnerable to structural distortions and/or dipolar or

spin-reorientation eﬀects. The giant value of MR observed in this class of 3:4:13 type

alloys, especially in a Gd-compound, is the highlight of this work.

INTRODUCTION

R3T4X13 are caged structure compounds in the class of strongly correlated electron inter-

metallics where, R is either a rare-earth element, an early d-block element such as Sc or Y,

or the alkali-earth metals Ca or Sr. T stands for a Group VIII d-electron element, and X is

either In, Ge, or Sn. The R3T4X13 compounds crystallize in the cubic space group P m3n.
Remeika et al.1 were the ﬁrst to report on R3T4X13 phases but, the literature refers to the
archetypal R3T4X13 phase as either the Pr3Rh4Sn13-structure type2, or the Yb3Rh4Sn13-
type3. This structure type allows a single crystallographic site for occupation by each of

the R and T atoms, and two distinct sites are available to the X atom. A schematic of the

crystal structure is presented in Fig 1 showing the cage-like structural network. R3T4X13

attracted attention mainly due to the discovery of superconductivity with superconducting

temperatures as high as Tsc = 8 K in Yb3Rh4Sn13 and Ca3Rh4Sn13

1 but this structure-type

has been of enduring interest due to its amenability to many diﬀerent elements and the wide

variety of physical properties.4,5 Remeika et al., reported the crystal structure of R3T4X13 in
a cubic primitive unit cell,1 however, also suggested face-centered and tetragonal structures

as possible unit cells. Hodeau et al., reported a body-centered unit cell for the same class of

compounds.6 Modiﬁcations to the cubic structure with changes in stoichiometry were sug-

gested in Ref.[7].7 The ﬁrst two reports on the crystal structure of the germanides are from

Segre et al.,8 and from Bruskov et al.,9 who proposed a disordered variant of the crystal

structure where Ge atoms partially occupy two diﬀerent 24k sites. A positional disorder

of the X atom or the formation of random mixture of R/T and X atoms are known.10,11

Doubling of the unit cell has been observed with a non-centrosymmetric I4132 space group
in some of the stannides (X = Sn) of R3T4X13.12,13

Stannides (X = Sn) in this class have been investigated in some detail, for example,

Ce3Ir4Sn13

14 and Ce3Rh4Sn13

15 are classiﬁed as heavy-fermion systems where high eﬀective

mass or larger density of states at the Fermi level have been observed. The stannide-R3T4X13

display superconductivity in the case of R3Rh4Sn13 (for R = La, Yb, Ca, Sr, Th) while an-

tiferromagnetism for Gd and Eu.6 A double-magnetic phase transition at 0.6 K and 2.1 K

is exhibited by the Ce-based stannide, Ce3Ir4Sn13.16 On the other hand, Eu3Ir4Sn13 where
Eu shows valence ﬂuctuation between non-magnetic Eu3+ (4f 6) and magnetic Eu2+ (4f 7),

shows an antiferromagnetic phase transition at 10 K.17 Nagoshi et al., studied single crystals

2

of Gd3Ir4Sn13 using magnetic susceptibility, resistivity, Hall eﬀect and epithermal neutron

scattering.12 They identiﬁed a structural distortion characterized by the propagation vector

(1/2, 1/2, 0). Only a single magnetic transition was identiﬁed at 10 K from macroscopic

measurements. The magnetic moment direction of Gd in the ordered state is suggested to

be perpendicular to the chain axis in each magnetic sublattice.12 Antiferromagnetic interac-

tions in one-dimensional chains together with ferromagnetic interaction between the nearest

chains in the same sublattice was assumed to be the reason behind the phase transition at

10 K. R3X4Sn13 compounds have been, in fact, reported to display multiple phase transitions

in close temperature intervals. For example, Eu3Ir4Sn13 is reported to show two transitions
in resistivity and speciﬁc heat occurring at T ∗ ∼ 57 K and at TN ≈ 10 K.17,18 The transition
at T ∗ was attributed to a structural distortion due to the displacement of Sn ions in the
Sn(1)Sn(2)12 cages while the transition at TN was attributed to antiferromagnetic ordering.

Interestingly, the structural distortion and the antiferromagnetic ordering were characterized

by the same propagation vector, qc = (1/2, 1/2, 0).19 Eventhough the structural transition
at T ∗ was observed to be suppressed by the application of external pressure up to 10.3 kbar,
the magnetic transition was not aﬀected.18 With the application of magnetic ﬁeld, a new

feature was observed to develop in the magnetically ordered state. Anomalous phase tran-

sitions were observed in Ce3Ir4Sn13 as well, where the anomalies occurred at 0.6 K and at

2 K.16 The transition at 0.6 K was identiﬁed as antiferromagnetic whereas the one at 2 K

was argued to be due to a change of band structure accompanied by a lattice expansion.

Interestingly, magnetic susceptibility did not present an anomaly at 2 K. It must be noted

here that an earlier report on Ce3Ir4Sn13 had shown that the 2 K-transition split into a

very sharp peak at 2.10 K and a shoulder-like one at 2.18 K.20 A closely related compound,

Eu3Rh4Sn13, showed only one anomaly at 11.2 K due to an antiferromagnetic transition21
but, in the magnetization measured for H (cid:107) [110] it showed two close-by transition when the
applied ﬁeld was 13 T. While the previous report17 speculated on the possibility of polaronic

eﬀects via electron-phonon coupling or Fermi surface induced changes in the conduction elec-
trons scattering to be the origin of the transition at T ∗, present understanding18 attributes
the origin of the high temperature transition to structural disorder within the cages.

In the present paper we endeavor to re-investigate Gd3Ir4Sn13 using magnetization, spe-

ciﬁc heat and electrical resistivity measurements on a polycrystalline sample. Even though

a polycrystalline sample was used for the study, two very close-by magnetic transitions in

3

Gd3Ir4Sn13 are identiﬁed through high resolution measurements. In addition, giant, positive
MR ≈ 80% is observed in this compound at 2 K which, to the best of our knowledge, is the
highest reported so far in this class of Gd-compounds.

II.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

Polycrystalline samples of Gd3Ir4Sn13 were prepared by arc melting the constituent ele-

ments Gd (99.99%), Ir (-22 mesh, Premion 99.99% Alfa Aesar) and Sn (99.99% Alfa Aesar)

together. The elements weighed according to stoichiometric ratio were melted in the water-

cooled Cu-hearth of Edmund Buehler arc melting furnace under static atmosphere of puriﬁed

argon gas. A Zr-getter trap was used for purifying the Ar gas. The once-melted sample was

ﬂipped over and re-melted 5 times in order to ensure a single homogeneous phase. The
melted samples were annealed for 2 weeks at 680 ◦C. Powder X ray diﬀractogram of pulver-
ized sample of Gd3Ir4Sn13 was obtained using a Philips X’pert diﬀractometer using Cu-Kα

radiation. Structural analysis of the x ray diﬀraction data was performed using Rietveld

method22 implemented in FullProf suite of programs.23 Magnetic measurements were per-

formed using a commercial Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS) and speciﬁc

heat was measured using a commercial Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS)

(both instruments from Quantum Design, San Diego). Electrical resistivity was measured
on a bar-shaped sample of dimension l × b × φ ≈ 5 mm × 3 mm × 0.8 mm using the ac
transport option of the PPMS. For magnetoresistance measurements, the magnetic ﬁeld B,
the current I, and sample length l were arranged such that B ⊥ I (cid:107) l. Thermal conduc-
tivity and Seebeck coeﬃcients were measured on a bar shaped sample using the Thermal

Transport Option (TTO) of the PPMS.

III. RESULTS

A. Crystal structure & distortions

The crystal structure of R3T4X13 compounds is generally described in cubic P m3n space

group (#223). Recent crystallography work on R3T4X13

24 compounds point towards the

existence of subtle structural distortions in this class of compounds and conﬁrms the ﬁndings

of earlier reports.1,2,6,25 Rietveld reﬁnement of the x ray data on Gd3Ir4Sn13 was performed

4

using the P m3n space group. The results of the reﬁnement are presented in Fig 2 where the

experimentally observed data are shown in circles and the calculated pattern as thick solid
line. The reﬁnement yielded a lattice parameter value of a (˚A) = 9.6539(3). Nagoshi et al.,12
pointed out the presence of several extra reﬂections mainly in the 2θ range of 25 to 55◦ in the
x ray diﬀraction pattern obtained on a single crystal of Gd3Ir4Sn13. A close inspection of the

x ray diﬀractogram of our sample also revealed additional superstructure peaks signifying

structural distortions in the present sample of Gd3Ir4Sn13. The (2θ, (h, k, l)) pairs of the
peaks are as following: (31.5◦, (1/2, 3/2, 3)), (37.9◦, (1/2, 7/2, 2)), (44.5◦, (5/2, 7/2, 2)) and
(50.5◦, (7/2, 7/2, 2)). One such peak is shown enlarged in the inset of Fig 2 where the
intensity is scaled down by a factor of 104. These peaks are indexed following the structural

distortion with a propagation vector qc = (1/2, 1/2, 0) (a minor impurity belonging to βSn
was observed at 43◦). The distorted structure of this type can be assigned to the space
group I4132, similar to the superlattice structure for Gd3Rh4Sn13 and La3Rh4Sn13.25

B. Speciﬁc heat

The experimentally measured speciﬁc heat, Cp(T ), of Gd3Ir4Sn13 is presented in the panel

(a) of Fig 3 along with that of the non-magnetic analogue La3Ir4Sn13 which is shown in the
ﬁgure using a solid line. The Dulong-Petit value of 3nR ≈ 166 J/mol.Gd-K is recovered
for Gd3Ir4Sn13 at 300 K (n is 1/3 of the number of atoms in the formula unit and R is

the universal gas constant). The Cp(T ) of Gd3Ir4Sn13 resembles that of other R3T4X13

compounds reported in the literature.26,27 However, the low-temperature region of speciﬁc
heat gives evidence of a double magnetic phase transition with two nearby peaks at TN 1 ≈
10 K and TN 2 ≈ 8.8 K. The inset of Fig 3 magniﬁes the temperature region between 1 K
and 14 K to highlight the double-peaks. Presented in the panel (b) are the speciﬁc heat

data under applied magnetic ﬁelds of 4 T and 9 T. It is observed that the application of
magnetic ﬁeld shifts the peak at TN 1 ≈ 10 K to low temperatures. Previous report on the
magnetic and transport properties of Gd3Ir4Sn13 did not identify the signature of double
magnetic phase transition in their data.12 The magnetic entropy, Sm(T ), was estimated by

subtracting the speciﬁc heat of non-magnetic analogous compound La3Ir4Sn13 from that of
Gd3Ir4Sn13. In this way, Sm ∼17.2 J/mol-K was obtained at TN 1 which is equal to Rln(8)
for the full multiplet of Gd3+ (Sm ≈16 J/mol-K, at TN 2 ).

5

C. Magnetization

The inverse magnetic susceptibility, 1/χ(T ), of Gd3Ir4Sn13 at 500 Oe is presented in the

panel (a) of Fig 4. A curve-ﬁt assuming Curie-Weiss law performed in the range 80–300 K

is shown as a straight line. The Curie-Weiss ﬁt leads to a value of eﬀective paramagnetic

moment µeﬀ = 7.2 µB/Gd-atom and Curie temperature θCW = -21 K. The θCW and µeﬀ
values are comparable to the theoretical free-ion value for Gd3+, ≈ 7.94 µB/ Gd-atom. The
observed deviation of the experimental value of magnetic moment from that of the free ion Gd

is interesting and might hint at the contributions from 5d electrons. The double-transition

in Gd3Ir4Sn13 is evident in magnetic response seen in the panel (b) of Fig 4, where M (T ) in

zero ﬁeld cooled cycle measured at 500 Oe is presented in enlarged scales. The panel (c) of

Fig 4 shows the magnetization isotherms, M (H) at 2.5 K and at 10 K plotted together. No

signature of ferromagnetism or metamagnetism is observed in the magnetization isotherms

while up to 9 T, the antiferromagnetic behaviour is retained.

D. Resistivity and magnetoresistance

The electrical resistivity, ρ(T ), of Gd3Ir4Sn13 in 0 T is presented in the main panel of Fig 5.
In general, a metal-like behaviour is observed with a prominent anomaly at ≈ 10 K. This
”kink” corresponds to TN 1. The residual resistance ratio (RRR) deﬁned as ρ(300 K)/ρ(2 K)

is approximately 50, which is higher than the value of RRR = 3 obtained on Gd3Ir4Sn13 single

crystals.12 This diﬀerence between our data and that of Nagoshi et al., is large only in the

magnetic state. Above the transition temperature the ratios are comparable. The deviation

from the RRR of a single crystal could possibly be due to a combination of grain boundary

eﬀects and electron-phonon scattering at high temperature. The Mott term also could be

relevant because the variation becomes non-linear at relatively low temperature which is

a signature of s-d interband scattering. Enhanced quality of the polycrystalline samples

reﬂected in RRR and visibility of low-temperature transition were observed in Ce3Pd20Si6

for example.28 A closer inspection of the temperature derivative dρ/dT plotted in the inset

(a) brings up both the anomalies TN 1 and TN 2 clearly.

It is observed that the electrical

6

resistivity of Gd3Ir4Sn13 below the transition at TN 1 can be faithfully described by the

expression;

ρ(T ) = ρ0 + AT n

(1)

In this expression, the ﬁrst term accounts for impurity scattering. A power-law of the form

AT n accounts for the normal Fermi-liquid quasiparticle excitation where 1 < n < 2. During
the ﬁt, the exponent n was left as a free parameter yielding a value of n ≈ 1.52(2) for 0 T
while it gradually increased to 1.63(2) for 9 T. The parameters derived from the ﬁt are

collected in Table I.

The magnetoresistance, deﬁned as MR% = ρ(H)−ρ(H=0)

ρ(H=0) × 100, of Gd3Ir4Sn13 is plotted in

the main panel of Fig 6. The MR is calculated for H = 1, 4 and 9 T. As can be seen from the
ﬁgure, with the application of 9 T giant, positive MR ≈ 80% is obtained at 2 K. A progressive
increase of MR with applied magnetic ﬁeld can be observed. What is evident is the sudden

increase of MR at TN 1 suggesting a close connection between the appearance of MR and the
antiferromagnetic transition. Above TN 1 ≈ 10 K, the magnetoresistance is nearly zero for
any value of applied ﬁeld. In the inset of Fig 6, the isothermal magnetoresistance is plotted

for 2 K and for 15 K. The positive MR is clearly reproduced for the isotherm at 2 K whereas

at 15 K, a linear behaviour is recovered.

E. Thermal transport

The experimentally measured thermal conductivity of Gd3Ir4Sn13 is presented in the

(cid:17)2

(cid:16) πk2

main panel of Fig 7 (a) denoted as κT. The electronic contribution to the total thermal
conductivity is estimated using the Wiedemann -Franz law as κe = L0T

ρ(T ). The Lorenz number
= 2.54 × 10−8 WΩK−2 and ρ(T ) is the electrical resistivity. The κe estimated
this way is subtracted from the total thermal conductivity to obtain the phonon contribution,

is L0 =

√
e

B
3

κph (κT (T) = κe(T ) + κph(T )). Both κe and κph are shown in Fig 7. It is interesting to note

that the magnetic transition at TN 1 is clearly reﬂected in the thermal conductivity data. The

thermal conductivity data bears a resemblance to the thermal transport data of other quasi-

skutterudite compounds like Y3Ir4Ge13.26 However, the thermopower of Gd3Ir4Sn13 exhibits
a behaviour slightly diﬀerent from that of the Ge-based compounds of this class.15,26,27 A

plateau-like region in the thermopower seen in the Ge-based compounds is not seen in the

present case, instead, a linear increase of thermopower is observed.

7

IV. DISCUSSION

The phase transitions T ∗ and TN reported to be observed in the stannides were not as
close-by in temperature as has been observed as TN 1 and TN 2 in Gd3Ir4Sn13 (i.e., at 8.8 K

and 10 K). The double-transition in the present compound is observed in M (T ), CP (T ),

ρ(T ) and in thermal conductivity and hence is a intrinsic bulk eﬀect. At lower applied ﬁelds

like 500 Oe, both the transitions TN 1 and TN 2 are clearly observed in the M (T ) curve (see

Fig 4). When the applied ﬁeld increases, the transition at TN 2 becomes less conspicuous in

M (T ), but is still clearly identiﬁed in dM (T )/dT. It is noted that with applied ﬁeld, the

TN 1 shifts to lower temperature while that at TN 2 remains unaﬀected. Such a feature is also

reﬂected in the speciﬁc heat. The earlier report on single crystals of Gd3Ir4Sn13 proposed a

chain-like magnetic structure for this compound with interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling

and weak ferromagnetism between the layers.12 In order to test whether any presence of

ferromagnetism can be detected, we performed ac susceptibility measurements (data not

shown here). Though signs of both TN 1 and TN 2 were clear in the data, there was no fre-

quency dispersion present. Also, the imaginary part of the ac susceptibility did not show

any temperature dependence ruling out any dissipative or ferromagnetic terms. The type of

antiferromagnetic order in Gd-alloys can be inferred from scrutinizing the speciﬁc heat.30,31

The peak value of magnetic speciﬁc heat at the transition temperature is estimated to be

20.15 J/mol K if the magnetic structure is any equal moment structure like simple antiferro-

, ferro- or heli-magnetic. Any amplitude modulation is expected to reduce this value. In

the present case of Gd3Ir4Sn13, a non-collinear magnetic structure may be expected follow-

ing this test. Amplitude modulated magnetic structures are very common among highly

anisotropic rare earth compounds with orbital magnetism. However, Gd is a S-state ion

with L = 0 and hence one could assume that dipolar interactions can become relevant as

has been reported in several Gd-compounds.32 It is interesting to note also that the J-J

coupling scheme becomes relevant in the case where Hund’s coupling is modest compared to

the spin-orbit coupling and it was shown by Niikura et al., that one of the seven 4f electrons

of Gd can result in carrying a quadrupole moment.33

The observation of positive giant magnetoresistance in Gd3Ir4Sn13, is an important ﬁnd-

ing of the present work. The R3X4Sn13 compounds are not reported to exhibit giant or

positive magnetoresistance. However, magnetoresistance anomalies in Gd-alloys have been

8

studied in detail and documented well.34–39 It is interesting to note that the temperature

dependence of electrical resistivity of Gd-alloys like GdCu2Si2 and GdNi2Si2 resemble that of
Gd3Ir4Sn13.34 The MR is observed to be positive for GdCu2Si2 above the N´eel temperature.34

This observation suggested that the contribution from the paramagnetic Gd ﬂuctuation is

small compared to that from the inﬂuence of magnetic ﬁeld on the Fermi surface. On the

other hand, for the Ni-based alloy, the MR is negative in the paramagnetic state. Though

this feature is reminiscent of Kondo spin ﬂuctuation phenomena, since Gd f electrons are

well-localized, this feature is attributed to the spin ﬂuctuations from the Ni d-band. In con-

trast to these two features, the MR of Gd3Ir4Sn13 is temperature independent at 15 K which

is above TN 1. From the analysis of eﬀective paramagnetic moment, it was seen that possible

contributions from the 5d electrons are present in Gd3Ir4Sn13. Gd2Ni3Si5 is another com-

pound that is reported to exhibit positive giant magnetoresistance.38 However, the MR was

not correlated to the rare earth moments but to the magnetic ordering of the lattice as the

magnitude of MR is found to be signiﬁcantly reduced in the paramagnetic state. Notably,

the MR was observed to be large in non-magnetic rare earths other than Gd in R2Ni3Si5
(Gd2Ni3Si5 showed ≈ 12% at 4.4 K for 45 kOe).38 In Gd3Ir4Sn13 also the enhancement of
MR is prominent below the magnetic ordering temperature which hints at the connection

between magnetic ordering and giant MR. Similar to Gd3Ir4Sn13, Gd2Ni3Si5 also has a lay-

ered magnetic structure and this structural feature also might play a role in the high value

of MR. On the other hand, giant magnetoresistance observed in Gd-based magnetocaloric

alloys like Gd5(Si1.8Ge2.2)36 is attributed to the presence of ﬁrst-order magnetostructural

transition. Note that in this compound a negative MR was observed. A similar feature was

observed in Ge-rich compound Gd5(Si0.1Ge0.9)4.37

Usually, positive MR can arise from Lorentz contribution to resistivity. In pure metals,

high cyclotron frequency and relaxation times can lead to positive MR. However, such a

scenario does not hold in the case of Gd3Ir4Sn13 which shows a higher low temperature re-

sistivity than pure metals. Another possibility is for positive MR in antiferromagnets to arise

due to enhancement of spin ﬂuctuations.40 However, MR in such case is not as high as been

observed in Gd3Ir4Sn13. Gd-ion being an S-state ion, crystalline electric ﬁeld eﬀects can be

ruled out as reasons for the observed giant MR. At this point it is interesting to mention

that the discovery of giant magnetoresistance was made on layered magnetic structures with

antiferromagnetic interlayer exchange.41 A highly plausible reason for the double-magnetic

9

transition and the positive giant magnetoresistance could be spin-reorientation eﬀects tak-

ing place in the layered magnetic structure of Gd3Ir4Sn13 with interlayer antiferromagnetic
exchange.12 However, it must be noted that spin-reorientation eﬀects in Tb2Ni3Si5 was ev-

ident in isothermal magnetization plots at 6 K and consequently was argued to have lead

to positive giant MR.38 The magnetization isotherms of Gd3Ir4Sn13 at 2.5 K (Fig 4 (b)) do

not present any deviation from linearity to support eﬀects of spin-reorientation.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The double-phase transition in the quasi-skutterudite Gd3Ir4Sn13 is unambiguously iden-

tiﬁed through magnetization, speciﬁc heat, electrical resistivity, and thermal conductivity
measurements. The two transitions occur very close to each other at TN 1 ≈ 10 K and at
TN 2 ≈ 8.8 K. The transition at TN 1 is seen to shift to lower temperature with application
of magnetic ﬁeld hence, revealing the antiferromagnetic nature whereas the transition at

8.8 K is very robust and does not change upon applied ﬁeld. The interesting result is

the observation of positive giant magnetoresiatance of about 80% below TN 1. The layered

quasi-1D magnetic structure of Gd3Ir4Sn13 and/or dipolar interactions commonly found in

Gd-based antiferromagnets could be the reason for the double-magnetic transition and the

positive giant magnetoresisatnce.
