ABSTRACT

The mechanism that accelerates particles to the energies required to produce the
observed high-energy impulsive emission in solar ﬂares is not well understood. Drake
et al. (2006) proposed a mechanism for accelerating electrons in contracting magnetic
islands formed by kinetic reconnection in multi-layered current sheets. We apply these
ideas to sunward-moving ﬂux ropes (2.5D magnetic islands) formed during fast recon-
nection in a simulated eruptive ﬂare. A simple analytic model is used to calculate the
energy gain of particles orbiting the ﬁeld lines of the contracting magnetic islands in our
ultrahigh-resolution 2.5D numerical simulation. We ﬁnd that the estimated energy gains
in a single island range up to a factor of ﬁve. This is higher than that found by Drake
et al. for islands in the terrestrial magnetosphere and at the heliopause, due to strong
plasma compression that occurs at the ﬂare current sheet. In order to increase their
energy by two orders of magnitude and plausibly account for the observed high-energy
ﬂare emission, the electrons must visit multiple contracting islands. This mechanism
should produce sporadic emission because island formation is intermittent. Moreover,
a large number of particles could be accelerated in each magnetohydrodynamic-scale
island, which may explain the inferred rates of energetic-electron production in ﬂares.
We conclude that island contraction in the ﬂare current sheet is a promising candidate
for electron acceleration in solar eruptions.

Introduction

The hard X-ray (HXR) and microwave radiation from solar ﬂares is generally accepted to be
emitted by nonthermal particles accelerated during the release of magnetic energy that powers the
ﬂare, when they interact with the ambient atmosphere. HXR emission is bremsstrahlung from
accelerated electrons that lose their energy through collisions (Holman et al. 2011) and microwave
emission is gyrosynchrotron from accelerated electrons that spiral the coronal magnetic ﬁeld (White
et al. 2011). On the other hand, extreme ultraviolet (EUV), coronal soft X-ray, and other secondary
emissions result from the thermalization of ﬂare energy in the ambient atmosphere (see reviews by
Benz 2008; Fletcher et al. 2011). Therefore HXR and microwave ﬂare observations, particularly
during the initial impulsive phase, oﬀer valuable clues about the physics of the particle-acceleration
process (e.g., Holman et al. 2011). Decades of study have established that these emissions often
are highly variable in time (e.g., Parks & Winckler 1969; Chiu 1970; Kane et al. 1983; Kiplinger
et al. 1983, 1984; Machado et al. 1993; Aschwanden et al. 1995) and originate at both the tops
and footpoints of coronal loops (Marsh & Hurford 1980; Hoyng et al. 1981; Masuda et al. 1994;
Reznikova et al. 2009; Caspi & Lin 2010; Ishikawa et al. 2011). More recently, a second coronal
source has been discovered above the loop-top coronal source (Sui & Holman 2003; Sui et al. 2004;
Pick et al. 2005; Liu et al. 2008; Su et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2013).

During ﬂares, HXR pulses lasting milliseconds to several seconds, superposed on more slowly
varying background emission, have been observed by NASA’s Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar
Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI; e.g., Holman et al. 2011; Inglis & Dennis 2012). These pulses are
most frequently seen during the early ﬂare impulsive phase, but occasionally are seen during the late
decay phase. Correlated temporal intermittencies of impulsive emissions in microwave and HXR
indicate a common, underlying, intermittent particle-acceleration mechanism (Aschwanden et al.
1995; Inglis & Nakariakov 2009; Nakariakov et al. 2010). Short trains of multiple pulses with varying
periods and amplitudes, denoted “quasi-periodic pulsations,” have been reported (Nakariakov &
Stepanov 2007; Inglis et al. 2008; Inglis & Nakariakov 2009; Nakariakov & Melnikov 2009; Inglis &
Dennis 2012; Inglis & Gilbert 2013), although whether they are truly periodic remains a matter of
debate (Vaughan 2010; Gruber et al. 2011; Inglis et al. 2015).

In the standard model for eruptive two-ribbon solar ﬂares (e.g., Carmichael 1964; Sturrock
1966; Hirayama 1974; Kopp & Pneuman 1976), the outward stretching of the magnetic structure
that ultimately comprises the coronal mass ejection (CME) forms a vertical electric current sheet
(CS) in the wake of the CME. Reconnection across this sheet (e.g., Sweet 1958; Parker 1963;
Petschek 1964) drives Alfv´enic outﬂows and shock waves, forms the ﬂare arcade loops and the
ejected CME ﬂux rope, and relaxes the stressed system toward a lower-energy state. Although
the original descriptions of the model posited a single reconnection site, numerous high-resolution
studies of both kinetic and magnetoﬂuid systems at high Lundquist number demonstrate that
CSs develop multiple reconnection sites with strong spatial (“patchy”) and temporal (“bursty”)
variability (e.g., Daughton et al. 2006, 2014; Drake et al. 2006b; Loureiro et al. 2007; Samtaney et al.
2009; Fermo et al. 2010; Uzdensky et al. 2010; Mei et al. 2012; Huang & Bhattacharjee 2012; Karpen

– 3 –

et al. 2012; Cassak & Drake 2013; Shen et al. 2013). The plasmoids (also called magnetic islands in
two dimensions) formed by reconnection can fragment, coalesce, or remain intact, as determined in
part by the boundary conditions, the initial condition (e.g., isolated sheets vs. multiple interacting
sheets), and whether the reconnection is driven or spontaneous. Several investigations relate solar
ﬂare pulsations to plasmoid formation by reconnection (see, for example, Kliem et al. 2000; Karlick´y
2004; Karlick´y & B´arta 2007; B´arta et al. 2008a). Dynamic plasmoid structures have been observed
in a few well-resolved, large-scale simulations of eruptive solar ﬂares (e.g., Karpen et al. 2012; Guo
et al. 2013). Spatial intermittencies, in the form of bright dynamic blobs, have been observed
in high-resolution EUV data from NASA’s Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), Solar
TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO), and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)(Ohyama
& Shibata 1998; Ko et al. 2003; Lin et al. 2005; Riley et al. 2007; Reeves et al. 2008; Lin et al.
2008; Ciaravella & Raymond 2008; Takasao et al. 2012; Kumar & Cho 2013; Liu et al. 2013). These
discrete features generally emanate from positions above the ﬂare loops, and often appear to be
spaced along a common line like beads on a wire.

Processes proposed to accelerate ﬂare electrons include the reconnection electric ﬁeld itself, in-
duced electric ﬁelds associated with the reconﬁguration of the reconnected magnetic ﬁeld, stochastic
scattering by turbulent magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves excited in the reconnection region,
and parallel electric ﬁelds associated with kinetic-scale Alfv´en-wave cascades downstream from the
ﬂare site (see the review by Zharkova et al. 2011). The second process includes the acceleration of
particles during magnetic-island contraction, discovered via kinetic simulations (Drake et al. 2005,
2006a,b, 2010, 2013; Fermo et al. 2010).
In essence, the particles gain energy by reﬂecting oﬀ
converging magnetic mirrors – in this case, the reconﬁgured ﬁeld lines of the contracting islands –
as proposed originally by Fermi (1949) in his model for cosmic-ray acceleration. Whereas a fully
self-consistent treatment of the problem requires calculating individual particle orbits and feedback
from the particles to the electromagnetic ﬁelds, Drake et al. (2010) derived some essential features
of the acceleration process using a kinetic approach based on adiabatic invariants of the particle
motion. Here, we use an analytic method extending the ideas presented in that paper.

Although the partitioning of ﬂare energy among kinetic energy, thermal energy, radiation, and
accelerated particles is not well established (Emslie et al. 2004, 2005; Raymond 2008), a signiﬁcant
fraction of the released magnetic free energy must be used in electron acceleration to explain the
observed X-ray intensities (Miller et al. 1997). A large number of particles are accelerated during
the brief discrete energy releases: for example, Kiplinger et al. (1983) estimated that more than
1034 electrons were accelerated to energies greater than 20 keV in one 400 ms spike. A major ﬂare
can accelerate more than 1036 electrons s−1 (Hoyng et al. 1976; Holman et al. 2003). Any proposed
acceleration mechanism must be highly eﬃcient to provide such a large number of accelerated
particles (known as the “number problem”; Brown & Melrose 1977). Given the low density of
the preﬂare corona and the required electron numbers, it is highly unlikely that most or all of
the electron acceleration can occur within the small diﬀusion region in reconnection sites. More
likely, the major acceleration occurs at the reconnection outﬂows along the reconnecting CS, as

– 4 –

observations of double coronal sources seem to indicate (Liu et al. 2008, 2013).

The objective of our paper is to apply the mechanism of charged-particle acceleration by
magnetic-island contraction to the results of a large-scale MHD simulation of a solar eruption, and
to assess the implications of the model for understanding observed high-energy ﬂare emissions.
For analytical simplicity, and in order to maximize the numerical resolution of our simulations
of eruptive ﬂares (EFs), we restrict our attention to an axisymmetric conﬁguration with two-
dimensional spatial variations but fully three-dimensional vector ﬁelds (a so-called 2.5D system).
Our analytic method of calculating the particle energy gain in contracting ﬂux ropes is presented
in detail in Appendices A-C; its key ﬁndings are summarized in §2. In §3, we describe the main
features of our simulated EF initiated by the magnetic breakout mechanism (Antiochos et al. 1999),
in which we extend previous work (Karpen et al. 2012, hereafter KAD12) to even ﬁner grids that
capture in greater detail the island evolution. Our analysis of island evolution and the associated
energy ampliﬁcation of particles in the ﬂare CS are presented in §4. The implications of our results
for the coronal origin of electrons accelerated in solar ﬂares and suggestions for further work are
discussed in §5.

2. Particle Acceleration via Island Contraction

The acceleration of particles to high energies in contracting magnetic islands has been studied
extensively by Drake and his collaborators (Drake et al. 2005, 2006a,b, 2010, 2013; Fermo et al.
2010) using particle-in-cell kinetic simulations (see also Zank et al. 2014). Drake et al. assumed
that many parallel CSs are present, as can occur if an initially extended single sheet bends and
folds upon itself. Under these conditions, particles undergo multiple episodes of acceleration as
they become energized within one contracting island, then drift or are scattered to another, where
the process begins anew. In solar EFs, on the other hand, the energization process is expected to
occur in islands within the single, dynamically evolving ﬂare sheet formed in the wake of the CME.

The time-varying geometry of such a contracting island is shown schematically in Figure 1,
from (a) an initial state with an elongated conﬁguration to (b) a ﬁnal state with a more circular
structure. The curves represent magnetic ﬂux surfaces; the red region is a narrow volume between
two such surfaces. After an island is formed during reconnection, the retraction of the ﬁeld lines
from the reconnection sites (represented by X symbols to the left and right of the island), due
to the Lorentz force, propels the ﬁeld lines toward the center, reshaping the island as shown. In
drawing this evolution, we have not assumed that the area between every pair of ﬂux surfaces is
preserved; that is, we do not assume that plasma is incompressible. This is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence
between the ﬂare environment and the kinetic applications: the plasma evolution in ﬂares is strongly
compressible, whereas the evolution simulated by Fermo et al. (2010) and analyzed by Drake et al.
(2010) is essentially incompressible.

We developed an analytic method to estimate the energy gained by particles in orbits around

2.5D magnetic ﬁeld lines in the general case where the island has an out-of-plane (toroidal) magnetic
ﬁeld component. The detailed calculations are presented in Appendix A, so in this section we
present the key results. We assumed that the ﬁeld lines are part of a ﬂux rope (Fig. 1 sketches their
projections in the plane perpendicular to the ﬂux rope axis) and the ﬂux rope is translationally
symmetric in the out-of-plane direction. We considered two-dimensional spatial variations, but
fully 3D particle velocities and magnetic ﬁelds. Our method is based on the conservation of the
magnetic moment and parallel action of particles whose orbits are completed much more quickly
than the magnetic ﬁeld changes in time.

Once a ﬂux surface of the ﬂux rope is created (after two reconnection episodes), particles
magnetically linked to that surface will orbit along it. We use subscript i to denote the initial
values of quantities at the time, ti, that a ﬂux surface is created. The orbiting particles have a
range of speeds V and pitch angles θ (angle between the particle velocity and the local magnetic
ﬁeld). The type of motion that a particle executes depends on the magnetic ﬁeld strength B along
the ﬁeld line and the particle’s pitch angle. For simplicity, we assume that the island is symmetric
left/right and up/down; therefore the ﬁeld strength of a ﬁeld line inside the island possesses two
equal minima B1 (left and right in Fig. 1, located near the magnetic X points) and two equal maxima
B2 (located near the arrow heads in Fig. 1). B is parameterized by the arc-length coordinate l

(2-1)
which is a reasonable representation for our simulated islands (see §4.2). The length of one turn
of the ﬂux rope is L. Note that B1, B2, and L may be time dependent and vary from one ﬂux
surface to another inside the ﬂux rope, and ti will be diﬀerent for each ﬂux surface of the island
(those closer to the axis of the ﬂux rope are created earlier than those farther away). The approach
used in Appendix A to derive the energy ampliﬁcation factors of particles orbiting these ﬁeld lines
is quite general, but this particular proﬁle for B allows the results to be expressed analytically in
closed form.

√

We identify two types of particle orbits: mirroring (Fig. 1c) and transiting (Fig. 1d); the
ever-present gyro-rotation about the magnetic ﬁeld is not shown in Figure 1. Which type of orbit a
particle executes is determined by the particle’s pitch angle, θ1, when the particle is at the minimum
of the ﬁeld, B = B1, and by the mirror ratio of the ﬁeld line, Rm = B2/B1 (see Appendix A).
If sin θ1 ≥ 1/
Rm, the particle mirrors at or before the maximum of the ﬁeld (Fig. 1c). On the
other hand, if sin θ1 < 1/
Rm, the particle traverses the entire island and its velocity parallel to
the ﬁeld never changes sign (Fig. 1d). Transiting particles move from one turn of the ﬂux rope to
the next, whereas mirroring particles are trapped in the original turn of the ﬂux rope where they
were injected. Fermi (1949) described the energy gain of particles reﬂected by moving magnetic
mirrors as being due to “type A” and “type B” acceleration for mirroring and transiting particles,
respectively.

√

Over a single turn of a particle’s orbit, the energy change is very small. We characterize
the initial energy of the particle by its energy when the particle is at the minimum of the ﬁeld,
E1i = mV 2
1 /2, will have
increased, as the magnetic ﬁeld slowly changed. In Appendix A, we show that the ratio of these
two energies can be expressed as follows:

1i/2. After many turns on its orbit, the particle’s ﬁnal energy, E1 = mV 2

θ1i is the pitch angle of the particle at ti, and E⊥ and E(cid:107) are the energy gains in the directionper-
pendicular and parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld, respectively:

Here V⊥ and V(cid:107) are the components of particle velocity perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic
ﬁeld, respectively. Therefore, the particle energy gain is a function of the ﬁeld strength and the
particle’s initial and ﬁnal pitch angles at the minimum of the ﬁeld, and it is independent of the

– 7 –

particle’s initial speed. In all cases, if the strength of the ﬁeld increases as the island evolves, the
perpendicular energy increases. The parallel energy gain depends upon the evolution of the pitch
angle relative to the ﬁeld strength. The energy multipliers E⊥ and E(cid:107) are diﬀerent, showing that
an initially isotropic energy becomes increasingly anisotropic as the islands evolve.

In Appendix A, we derive an analytic expression for the ﬁnal pitch angle θ1 as a function of
the initial angle θ1i. In practice, θ1 is calculated by numerically solving transcendental equations
that are functions of the ﬁeld line properties: the minimum ﬁeld strength, the mirror ratio, and
the length of one turn of the ﬁeld line. Because our simulations described in §3 provide us with
these ﬁeld line properties, we can compute the energy gain for particles at all initial pitch angles
as our simulated islands evolve (§4.3). The general results in Appendix A simplify to algebraic
expressions in the limiting case of uniform ﬁeld strength, B2 = B1, in which there are no mirroring
particles. For this case (Appendix B), we show that the toroidal (out of plane) ﬁeld has the net
eﬀect of moderating the impact of changes in the island perimeter on energy gain, and that plasma
compression is also relevant for particle energy change. In Appendix B, we also compare our results
with previous analytical results from Drake et al. (2010). In Appendix C, we estimate the range of
validity of our analysis: it is appropriate for a signiﬁcant fraction of the coronal electron population,
though only for protons and ions that already are strongly superthermal. Therefore, our approach
is adequate for a ﬁrst assessment of the contribution of magnetic-island contraction to electron
acceleration in solar ﬂares.

3. Simulated Breakout CME/EF

We investigate the generation and evolution of islands in a ﬂare CS by simulating a fast
CME/EF according to the well-studied breakout paradigm (Antiochos 1998; Antiochos et al. 1999;
MacNeice et al. 2004; DeVore & Antiochos 2005, 2008; Lynch et al. 2008, 2009; Karpen et al. 2012;
Masson et al. 2013). This model has been described thoroughly in previous papers, so we only
summarize the fundamental aspects here. Key structures and evolutionary stages in the model are
illustrated in Figure 2. A fast breakout CME/EF requires three essential ingredients: two or more
ﬂux systems in the corona, yielding at least one magnetic null point; slow accumulation of magnetic
free energy, through either ﬂux emergence or (as in our simulations) footpoint motions; and a small
but ﬁnite resistivity that allows reconnection to occur. Given these three elements, eruption is
inevitable once the critical amount of free energy has accumulated in the system (see KAD12).
Reconnection plays two key roles in this scenario: breakout reconnection at the preexisting coronal
null removes overlying ﬂux that restrains the stressed core ﬁeld from erupting, and ﬂare reconnection
partially detaches the erupting core, thus separating the ﬂux rope that comprises the CME from
the arcade of ﬂare loops below.

Our previous studies demonstrated the viability of this model in 2.5D and 3D, with and without
the presence of a solar wind. A recent investigation (KAD12) found that a resistive instability in the
ﬂare CS is responsible for triggering the explosive eruption, thus identifying a physical basis for the

temporal evolution is shown in the animation available in the online version (f2 movie.mpg).

strong observed connection between fast CMEs and two-ribbon ﬂares. This conclusion followed from
our analysis of an ultra-high-resolution, 2.5D MHD simulation of a breakout eruption performed
with the Adaptively Reﬁned MHD Solver (ARMS). ARMS employs a ﬁnite-volume representation
of the plasma and magnetic ﬁeld, high-ﬁdelity Flux-Corrected Transport techniques (DeVore 1991),
and adaptive mesh reﬁnement managed by the PARAMESH toolkit (MacNeice et al. 2000). As in all
ﬁnite-volume solutions to the MHD equations, numerical resistivity permits magnetic reconnection
to occur at electric CSs that thin down to the ﬁnite scale of the simulation grid. Adaptivity
criteria tailored to the developing CSs allowed us to achieve the highest overall spatial resolution
to date in a CME/EF simulation. Consequently, the high-cadence KAD12 simulation followed
the self-consistent formation of the breakout and ﬂare CSs, and tracked the dynamic life cycle
of numerous magnetic islands in both CSs. The null-ﬁnding capability implemented by KAD12
enables individual nulls to be identiﬁed and characterized as X- and O-types (Parnell et al. 1996).

We found that still higher resolution is required to analyze the changing shapes of the islands in
the ﬂare sheet, in order to estimate the resulting particle energization described in §4. Therefore,
in the present work, we use the same initial and boundary conditions as KAD12 but increase
the maximum resolution from 6 to 8 levels of reﬁnement. A detailed description of the reﬁnement
criteria is given in KAD12. The minimum distance between grid points dg achieved in our simulated
ﬂare CS is ≈ 0.001Rs = 700 km, comparable to the resolution of SDO’s Atmospheric Imaging Array.
The initial potential-ﬁeld conﬁguration of our simulation represents the Sun’s global dipole
ﬁeld plus a large equatorial active region (see Fig. 2a), the simplest conﬁguration that meets
the ﬁrst (multipolar) requirement for the breakout mechanism. As in KAD12, the maximum
initial ﬁeld strength at the solar poles is 10 G. ARMS solved the ideal 2.5D MHD equations in
spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ); see KAD12 for a full description of the equations. Figure 2 and
the accompanying animation (available in the online journal) illustrate the evolution of the system
from its initial potential state through eruption and ﬂaring. As in our previous breakout studies,
free energy was added slowly to the system by driving antiparallel footpoint motions in a narrow
band centered on the equatorial polarity inversion line (PIL). The ﬂow velocities are well below the
Alfv´en and sound speeds at the lower boundary. The resulting excess magnetic pressure compresses
the initial coronal null point (Fig. 2a) into a breakout CS (Fig. 2b) that eventually thins down to
the grid scale. Thereafter, reconnection steadily removes overlying ﬂux enabling the core to expand.
Behind the expanding core, the ﬂare CS forms, lengthens, and thins down to the grid scale (Fig. 2c);
it extends to the top of the ﬂare arcade and is roughly aligned with the equatorial radial direction.
When fast reconnection starts at the ﬂare CS, much of the magnetic free energy is released rapidly
as the ﬂux rope detaches and strongly accelerates outward. Islands formed by the ﬂare reconnection
move along this CS (Fig. 2d).

4. Analysis and Results

4.1. Flare Current Sheet Nulls

Reconnection in the ﬂare CS begins at time t ≈ 81760 s, when a single X-null forms at r =
1.4375 Rs. Note that our “nulls” are locations where the 2D poloidal magnetic ﬁeld (components
in the r − θ plane) is zero, although the toroidal ﬁeld (in the φ direction) is generally non-zero.
Only a few transient, slow-moving nulls form in the ﬂare sheet at ﬁrst, but the reconnection quickly
transitions at t ≈ 84000 s to produce fast Alfv´enic jets and a series of sunward- and outward-moving
islands. Each island is an O-null formed by reconnection at two X-nulls on either side of the O-null.
Figure 3 shows the radial locations of X- (black crosses) and O-nulls (red circles) as functions of
time for a small angular wedge within ±5◦ of the solar equator and radial heights in the range
r = 1.1 − 1.5Rs. This wedge encloses the lower part of the ﬂare CS and the central part of the top
of the ﬂare arcade.

Fig. 3.— Radial position of X- (black crosses) and O- (red circles) nulls as a function of time. The
evolution of Island 1 and Island 2 is discussed in §4.2.

Throughout the evolution, there is one main X-null (marked in Fig. 3) in the ﬂare CS from
which most of the reconnection outﬂows, including both sunward- (negative slope in Fig. 3) and
outward-moving (positive slope in Fig. 3) islands, are generated. The global evolution and the
radially expanding geometry of the system dictate its location. Throughout the ﬂare, the main
null undergoes a modest change in height, much less than the change in height of the core O-null
of the CME (also marked in Fig. 3; it quickly moves out beyond the height range in the ﬁgure).
Occasionally, an adjacent X-null becomes the new main X-null; one such transition occurs near
t = 90, 500s in Figure 3. According to B´arta et al. (2008b, 2011), a newly formed island moves in
the direction away from whichever of its delimiting X-nulls has the higher rate of reconnection, due
to an excess of magnetic tension. If a second X-null forms at a radial distance above/below the main
X-null, the island moves outward/sunward. Shen et al. (2011) also report that the reconnection
rate reaches a maximum at the main X-null in their MHD simulation of a ﬂare CS.

Sunward-moving islands merge with the ﬂare arcade, which grows in height as the reconnected
ﬂux piles up. Therefore, these O-nulls stop their sunward motion at progressively higher altitudes;
their last recorded positions trace approximately the instantaneous top of the arcade. The ﬁrst
outward-moving island forms the core of the ﬂux rope that becomes the CME (CME core O-null in
Fig. 3). Subsequent outﬂowing islands merge with the rising ﬂux rope above the maximum radial
range of Figure 3. We ﬁnd that our islands exhibit little coalescence between them as they move
along the ﬂare CS in either direction. Instead, each island remains discrete until it merges with the
ﬂare arcade below the sheet or the CME ﬂux rope above.

Due to the magnetic shear in the erupting central arcade, each of our islands is a twisted 2.5D
ﬂux rope rather than a closed planar loop. Two examples (yellow lines) are shown in Figure 4.
In our simulations, the ﬂux ropes are not rooted at the Sun due to the special symmetry of the
system; in 3D, they would be rooted on either side of the PIL, with ﬁnite displacements between
their footpoints. As we noted above, the islands form due to reconnections of the same ﬂux surfaces
at two X-nulls, one above and one below the island. Beyond the ends of each island are ﬂux surfaces
that have reconnected only once at an X-null, which therefore remain rooted at the Sun. Three
examples (red lines) are shown in Figure 4.

Island Evolution

For this initial investigation of particle acceleration by island contraction following ﬂare recon-
nection, we focus on the sunward-moving islands in the CS. In particular, “Island 1” and “Island
2” in Figure 3 are tracked carefully from their birth to their arrival at the top of the ﬂare arcade.
We selected them because they are long-lived, clear features, with diﬀerent physical characteristics.
Several snapshots of these islands in the φ = 0 plane (x = r sin θ, z = r cos θ) are shown in Figures
5 and 6, with the x-locations of their respective O-nulls marked by black arrows. Island 1 is smaller
and less resolved than Island 2.
In Figure 5, a chain of islands can be seen both leading and
trailing Island 1. The distortion of Island 2 during its interaction with the top of the arcade can

Fig. 4.— Islands are disconnected ﬂux ropes (yellow ﬁeld lines) formed from two reconnection
episodes at paired X-nulls. Over- and underlying sheared ﬂux surfaces (red ﬁeld lines) formed from

be seen in Figure 6d. Each island has ﬁnite length along the CS and contains ﬁnite ﬂux. As time
passes and the reconnection continues, the ﬂux entrained by the islands increases, so the islands
appear to expand. The individual ﬂux surfaces within each island contract with time, however, as
demonstrated below.

where Aφ(r, θ) is the φ component of the magnetic vector potential.
Isosurfaces of Ψ trace the
projection of ﬁeld lines onto the computational r − θ plane because the magnetic ﬁeld vector is
tangential to those surfaces. Therefore, contours of Ψ deﬁne individual ﬂux surfaces. One sample
ﬂux surface (black line) is tracked versus time in each of Figures 5 and 6.

To determine the characteristic properties of our islands over time, we chose a set of ﬁxed ﬂux
surfaces with selected values of Ψ inside each island. We tracked each surface from its creation at
time ti to its arrival at the ﬂare arcade. Figure 7 shows the set of chosen ﬂux surfaces (color-coded
and numbered) at a time well after their formation for Island 1 (7a, top panel) and Island 2 (7b,
bottom panel). The instantaneous locations of the island nulls are marked by black crosses (X-nulls)
and red circles (O-nulls). The X-null to the right of Island 1 is not shown because it is well outside
the range of the plot, at x = 1.3984. The number of ﬂux surfaces chosen for Island 1 is smaller
than for Island 2 because of the diﬀerence in size. The grid lines (white) show that the innermost
ﬂux surface (0) of Island 1 is only about three cells across, the minimum resolvable area, and the
enclosed areas of ﬂux surfaces 0 and 1 are not resolved after time t ≈ 84440 due to contraction.
Although our simulation uses the highest resolution to date, resolving the islands, particularly their
innermost ﬂux surfaces that form earliest, is a signiﬁcant computational challenge.

The ﬂux surfaces within each island are created sequentially, from innermost (closest to the
O-null) to outermost, so ti generally increases across our sample of ﬂux surfaces. These initial
times are listed in Tables 1 and 2 for Islands 1 and 2, respectively. The cadence of output from the
simulation run was 20 s, which is the uncertainty in ti.

The proﬁle of magnetic ﬁeld strength versus arc length along each ﬂux surface at time ti is
shown in Figure 8. Arc length l = 0 corresponds to the point of the ﬁeld line closest to the Sun’s
surface, and the end of each curve corresponds to one turn of the ﬁeld line at l = L. The minima of
B (B1) occur near the two X-nulls, and the two maxima (B2) occur between those points, consistent
with the analytical formula we adopted in Equation 2-1. The inhomogeneity is more pronounced
for Island 2, whose poloidal (in-plane) ﬁeld component Bp, is strongly dominant: the toroidal (out-
of-plane) ﬁeld component Bt weakens with time as less-sheared ﬂux reconnects across the ﬂare

averaged along the perimeter of the ﬂux surface.

direction. Thereafter, the changes in lengths are much smaller.

For Island 1, the maximum of ﬂux surfaces ratios L/Li ranges between 1.4 and 2.0, with the
exception of the outermost ﬂux surface (ﬂux surface 7, violet color), where of L/Li = 2.19. Flux
surface 7 is initially much longer than its neighbors because at ti it encloses an extra X-null from a
small, short-lived island that coalesces with Island 1 between 84300 and 84360 s. This ﬂux surface
initially has a large aspect ratio and then retracts, reducing its length quickly. This shows the
eﬀect of island coalescence in enhancing island contraction. Flux surfaces that were inside Island
1 before the merger experience a temporary increase in their length as they become part of the
reconnection upstream ﬂow along the direction of the CS, at the null between the islands. There is
another coalescence with a much smaller and short-lived island between 84400 and 84440 s, with
insigniﬁcant eﬀects on the chosen ﬂux surfaces.

Island 2 has similar behavior to Island 1, except that it does not merge with other islands;
it only interacts with the ﬂare arcade. The maximum ratio L/Li for Island 2 is between ≈ 1.05
(outermost ﬂux surface) and 2.26 (innermost ﬂux surface). All ﬂux surfaces are well-resolved at all
times except ﬂux surface “0”, whose enclosed area is not resolved after time t ≈ 90740 (see Fig.
7b for the shape of this ﬂux surface at this time). At t ≈ 90900s, the X-null closest to the Sun
starts to move quickly toward the Sun leaving the opposite X-null behind, which in turn becomes

– 18 –

the new main X-null of the ﬂare (see Fig. 3). This separation of the nulls slightly stretches the ﬂux
surfaces.

Island 1 has a much smaller poloidal area than Island 2, but the lengths of its ﬁeld lines are
in general much larger because its toroidal ﬁeld is so strong relative to its poloidal ﬁeld. This can
be seen, for example, in the listed values of Lp and L at time ti in Tables 1 and 2. The toroidal
component of the ﬁeld increases almost monotonically with time for the ﬂux surfaces of Island 1
as the total magnetic pressure increases. For Island 2, this component increases until the sunward
X-null starts moving rapidly toward the ﬂare arcade, then it decreases as the total thermal pressure
decreases. Tables 1 and 2 list the initial magnetic (separated by components) and thermal pressures
of each ﬂux surface. Island 1 is magnetically dominated, and its plasma-β decreases with time. In
contrast, Island 2 is thermally dominated, and its plasma-β increases with time.

A particle’s parallel and perpendicular energy gains directly depend on the evolution of B1
(Eqs. 2-3 and 2-4). The evolution of B1 is shown in Figs. 9b (Island 1) and 10b (Island 2). For
both islands, B1 increases rapidly at ﬁrst as the islands tend to a more uniform magnetic ﬁeld,
then much more slowly, with occasional ﬂuctuations. In general, the evolution of B1 is favorable
for both components of energy gain. The homogenization of the ﬁeld can be seen in Figs. 9c and
10c, where the mirror ratio of ﬂux surfaces is plotted. For each island, B2/B1 decreases rapidly as
B1 increases; later, the rate of decrease lessens until the mirror ratio ﬂuctuates mildly. For Island
1, its ﬂux surfaces are most uniform at about 84480 s. After this time, the magnetic ﬁeld proﬁle
no longer resembles the analytical form proposed in §2 (Eq. 2-1); energy gains are not calculated
after this time in §4.3. Island 2 exhibits similar behavior: the ﬁeld is most uniform at about 91080
s, after which our assumptions on the shape of the magnetic ﬁeld proﬁle are no longer applicable.
Island 2’s B1 temporarily decreases after its sunward X-null moves quickly toward the Sun.

The peak mirror ratio in Island 1 is ≈ 1.6, much smaller than in Island 2, which achieves a
value as large as ≈ 8. The diﬀerence in the maximum mirror ratios is due to the moderating eﬀect
of the toroidal ﬁeld and the aspect ratio of the ﬂux surfaces. Island 1 has a strong toroidal ﬁeld and
behaves closer to the uniform-ﬁeld case discussed in Appendix B. In contrast, Island 2 has a weak
toroidal ﬁeld, so it behaves like a strong magnetic trap initially and transitions to uniform-ﬁeld
behavior very late, relative to Island 1. For Island 2, the outermost ﬂux surfaces have the largest
mirror ratios because the ﬁeld strength minima always are very small near the X-nulls, whereas the
maxima are highest at the greatest cross-sheet distance from the O-null. Consequently, the mirror
ratio for newly formed ﬂux surfaces more than doubles over time for Island 2 (Fig. 10c), whereas
it declines slightly, but irregularly, for Island 1 (Fig. 9c). The initial values of the minimum and
maximum ﬁeld strengths on each ﬂux surface are listed in Tables 1 and 2.

Plasma compression occurs as the islands contract.

In the uniform-ﬁeld limit discussed in
Appendix B, we show that plasma compression contributes directly to the perpendicular energy
gain. Figures 9d and 10d show the electron density averaged over the ﬂux surfaces, < n >, as
functions of time. For all ﬂux surfaces in Island 1, the electron density increases monotonically and

has similar values for all ﬂux surfaces (due mainly to their proximity in this small island). The
electron density in Island 2 increases monotonically until t ≈ 91000 s (when expansion of the island
starts) and then decreases. The density ratio for both islands (cid:104)n(cid:105) /(cid:104)ni(cid:105) ranges from 1 to ≈ 2.8,
with the innermost surfaces having the highest compression ratios. The initial densities, (cid:104)ni(cid:105), are

We estimated the number of electrons per radian of angular extent out of the plane, N(cid:48),
enclosed by the outermost studied ﬂux surface of each island. We integrated the electron number
density across the area enclosed by that ﬂux surface, and then multiplied this integral by Rs to
account for the out-of-plane length. For the smaller Island 1, N(cid:48) ≈ 2 × 1035 electrons per radian;
for the larger Island 2, N(cid:48) ≈ 2.5 × 1036 electrons per radian. Thus, our results suggest that it is

4.3. Particle Energy Gain

We now calculate the energy gain of particles within our islands using the properties from
§4.2 and Equations (2-2)–(2-4). As discussed previously, the energy gain of a particle moving
adiabatically along a ﬂux surface is a function of the particle’s initial pitch angle and the properties
of the ﬂux surface; it is independent of the particle’s initial energy. Therefore, for each ﬂux surface in
Islands 1 and 2, we calculated the energy gain for particles with initial pitch angles θ1i in the range
5◦ to 85◦, at 5◦ intervals. At selected times after formation time ti, we used the instantaneous
properties of the ﬂux surfaces described in §4.2, solved the transcendental equations derived in
Appendix A, and calculated the new pitch angles and the energy ratios. The value of θ and the
mirror ratio of the ﬂux surface a particle is orbiting determine whether the particle is transiting or
mirroring. Conversions between these two populations occur as the ﬂux surface properties change
over time, as shown in the ﬁgures below and discussed in Appendix A.

Results for a representative ﬂux surface within Island 1 (black curves in Fig. 5 and ﬂux surface
labeled “5” in Fig. 7a) are shown in Figure 11, and those for a ﬂux surface within Island 2 (black
curves in Fig. 6 and ﬂux surface labeled “8” in Fig. 7b) are shown in Figure 12. The colors
represent the initial pitch angles, tabulated at the right of each ﬁgure. They range from violet
at 5◦ for particles with almost solely parallel motion, which execute transiting orbits, to red at

overplotted with a circle indicate transiting particles; those without a circle indicate mirroring
particles. In both ﬁgures, particles at certain initial pitch angles (e.g., 65◦, light green, in Fig. 11;
35◦, medium blue, in Fig. 12) convert from mirroring to transiting motion as the mirror ratio of
ﬁeld strengths along the ﬂux surface decreases over time.

The principal results of this study are illustrated by Figs. 11a and 12a, which show the total
energy ratios, E, from Equation (2-2). We ﬁnd that the maximum total energy ratio is Emax ≈ 4.7
for Island 1, on the outermost ﬂux surface, which is involved in the island coalescence (for the eﬀects
of energy gain by island coalescence in diﬀerent regimes see, for example, Fermo et al. (2010) and
Zank et al. (2014)). The last column of Table 1 lists Emax for each ﬂux surface. In general, the
values of Emax are larger for Island 2 (see Table 2), even though this island does not experience any
coalescence with other islands, achieving a maximum of ≈ 5.2. These values are somewhat larger
than the factor of ≈ 3 reported by Drake et al. (2010) for electrons orbiting a single contracting
island in particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of multiple, parallel CSs. Our values are greater due
mainly to compression of the ﬂux surfaces as our islands stream down the ﬂare CS toward the top
of the ﬂare arcade. Most of Drake’s islands in PIC simulations are incompressible, i.e. the area of
islands is conserved after island merging (see Fermo et al. 2010).

To understand the energy gains in greater detail, we display the parallel energy ratio, E(cid:107) in

Eq. (2-4), in panel b) of Figures 11 and 12. E⊥ (Eq. (2-3)) is shown with a black curve in panel
c) of the same ﬁgures. The increasing strength of the magnetic ﬁeld in the contracting islands
increases the perpendicular energy of all particles, in order to conserve their magnetic moment.
A steep rise in perpendicular energy gain occurs early, when B1 changes rapidly, then the growth
levels oﬀ while the islands contract slowly. The parallel energy of a particle will increase (decrease)
if the length of its orbit decreases (increases), in order to conserve parallel action. For transiting
particles, their parallel energy gain increases as long as the island contracts, independent of their
pitch angle, because the length of their orbits is the length of the turn of the ﬁeld line (L). The
maximum parallel energy gain occurs for particles with θ = 0, with E(cid:107)max = (Li/L)2. Depending
on how much B1 changes compared to the change in the square of the length, E⊥ may be smaller
(Island 1 case) or larger (Island 2 case) than E(cid:107)max. Li/L is similar for both islands, but the change
in B1 is larger for Island 2.

For mirroring particles, the length of their orbits may decrease (increase) if the separation
of the “mirrors” decreases (increases), even if the total length of the ﬂux surface decreases. This
depends on how fast the mirror ratio, the pitch angle, and the total length of the ﬁeld line change
(see Eqs. A.10 and A.11). For example, Figs. 13 and 14 show lo (a quarter of the orbit length,
see Appendix A for details) for all particles of ﬂux surfaces in Figs. 11 and 12, respectively. For
both islands, most of the mirroring particles experience a slight decrease in lo at early times, which
translates into an small increase in parallel energy. Later on, lo increases with time and the parallel
energy decreases. As particles transition from mirroring to transiting, lo converges to L/4.0 For
some initial pitch angles slightly larger than the loss-cone angle limit, the transition from mirroring
to transiting motion may occur at early times, while the ﬂux surface is still contracting. If lo was
increasing prior to the transition time, the parallel energy ratio switches from a loss to a gain (see,
for example θ1i = 60◦ in Fig. 13). If lo was decreasing prior to that time, the parallel energy ratio
is always larger than 1 (see, for example θ1i = 25◦ in Figure 14).

To better distinguish between mirroring and transiting behaviors, the evolution of particle
pitch angles on two ﬂux surfaces is shown in panels b) of Figs. 13 and 14. For ﬂux surface 5 of
Island 1, whose initial mirror ratio is ≈ 1.6, particles with initial pitch angles below ≈ 52◦ are
inside the loss cone (see Appendix A). For ﬂux surface 8 of Island 2, whose initial mirror ratio
is ≈ 6.15, particles with initial pitch angles below ≈ 24◦ are inside the loss cone. If pitch angles
were initially isotropically distributed among the particles inside these islands, many more particles
would experience mirroring in Island 2 than in Island 1. Pitch angles increase for those cases where
the perpendicular energy gain is larger than the parallel energy gain. Pitch angles decrease at ti
for Island 2 because there is a slight decrease in perpendicular energy as B1 decreases at that time.

The weighting coeﬃcients of the energy gain components (ﬁrst and second terms of Equation
2-2) depend on the particle’s initial pitch angle. Both factors contribute to the total energy am-
pliﬁcation occurring in the islands, but in diﬀerent proportions for the mirroring and transiting
particles. The larger the initial pitch angle, the stronger the perpendicular gain contribution to
the total energy gain. On the other hand, the smaller the initial pitch angle, the larger the parallel

– 25 –

contribution to the energy gain. The total perpendicular and parallel contributions to the energy
gain are shown in the bottom panels of Figures 11 and 12. The largest energy gains for Island 1 are
due mostly to energy gain in the parallel direction and mostly for transiting particles. The opposite
is true for Island 2: the largest energy gains are due mostly to energy gain in the perpendicular
direction, for mostly mirroring particles. Consequently, panels a) and d) most closely resemble each
other for Island 1, while panels a) and c) do so for Island 2.

5. Discussion

We calculated analytically the energy gains of particles that are conﬁned to large-scale in-
dividual 2.5D magnetic islands generated by spatially and temporally variable reconnection in a
single CS. Due to contraction of the islands as they move along the sheet after being formed, their
particles are subject to type A and type B Fermi (1949) acceleration. Our calculations extend an
analysis by Drake et al. (2006a) of particle motion and adiabatic invariants in kinetic systems. We
applied the method to an MHD-scale system including plasma compressibility and a ﬁnite guide
ﬁeld for consistency with the solar ﬂare environment. As derived in Appendix A, a particle’s energy

gain depends upon its initial pitch angle and on the changes in length, magnetic ﬁeld strength, and
mirror ratio of the ﬂux surface along which the particle moves. The energy gain is diﬀerent in the
directions parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld, so that an initially isotropic distribution
of particles becomes increasingly anisotropic over time.

To calculate the island formation and evolution leading to particle energy gains in ﬂares, we
performed a 2.5D simulation of a breakout CME/EF with the highest resolution to date (8 levels
of reﬁnement). Fast reconnection in our simulated ﬂare CS is intermittent and forms large-scale
magnetic islands. We analyzed in detail two sunward-moving islands formed by reconnection in the
ﬂare CS below the CME, from their birth to their arrival at the top of the ﬂare arcade. These islands
contract, their ﬁeld strengths increase, and they have relatively large magnetic mirror ratios. We
found that individual islands are candidates for only modest acceleration of particles intermittently
in ﬂares, yielding energy gain ratios of 1–5. This energy gain is higher than those shown in Figure 2
of Drake et al. (2006a) and Figure 5 of Drake et al. (2010) due to the compressibility of the plasma
in our simulations. The mechanism should produce sporadic emission because island formation
is intermittent. A large number of particles is accelerated while an island evolves, then streamed

toward the footpoints or released into the top of the arcade by reconnection. When a new island is
formed, a new set of particles is accelerated.

The modest energy ratios obtained on ﬂux surfaces within single islands cannot boost su-
perthermal electrons suﬃciently to account for the observed ﬂare HXR and microwave emissions.
However, we expect that a larger number of islands would be formed in simulations with ﬁner grids
at lower resistivity. Higher resolution simulations are needed to test this in our global simulation.
In this case, particles near the outermost ﬂux surfaces could “jump” between islands at the X-null
that separates one island from the next, as described by Drake et al. (2006a). In this way, a particle
needs to visit only a few islands to increase its energy by two orders of magnitude. It is currently
impossible to test this hypothesis with even state-of-the-art PIC simulations (e.g., Daughton et al.
2009, 2014), for the parameters of our simulation. To corroborate our analytical results, look for
evidence of particle transfer from island to island, and examine the particle acceleration that occurs
during fast island mergers at the top of the ﬂare arcade, we are currently developing a “test parti-
cle” method. In this approach, the individual guiding-center orbits of an ensemble of test particles
are calculated in the evolving electromagnetic ﬁeld of the MHD simulation.

Drake et al. (2006a) report that the back pressure from accelerated particles limits the con-
traction achieved. If many particles are accelerated, large amounts of energy will be transferred to
them, reducing the total available free magnetic energy. These nonlinear eﬀects are not included
in our, or any other, purely MHD simulation, because calculating the self-consistent simultaneous
evolution of the particles and the electromagnetic ﬁeld requires a fully kinetic approach. A kinetic
simulation also might reveal disruptive phenomena such as mirror and ﬁrehose instabilities, driven
by the anisotropic particle distribution functions that develop due to the island contraction (Drake
et al. 2010). Furthermore, MHD shocks form in our ﬂare current sheet (KAD12), and shock electric
ﬁelds at kinetic scales also could contribute to particle acceleration. The only potentially feasible
approach to solving the global problem of eruptive-ﬂare evolution together with the local problem
of self-consistent nonlinear feedback between particles and ﬁelds would seem to be an embedded
PIC method (e.g., Daldorﬀ et al. 2014).

As shown for Island 1, island coalescence may increase the energy gain. Coalescence is favored
in kinetic systems with many current layers, but there is no evidence (observational or numerical)
for a ﬂare CS to have multiple layers or to be folded upon itself. Reconnection in our ﬂare CS is
globally driven, as opposed to kinetic scenarios where reconnection is spontaneous or triggered by
a small perturbation. Higher resolution may increase the coalescence frequency in our simulations.
In more complicated 3D geometries, current ﬁlamentation may occur with plasmoids forming at
multiple reconnection sites and interacting and merging. High-resolution 3D simulations capable
of resolving a wide range of island sizes are needed to address these issues.

We show that our analysis is valid for a signiﬁcant fraction of the coronal electron population
over a reasonable range of preﬂare temperatures. The number of electrons in our simulated islands
is large, of order 1035–1036 per radian of angular extent along the PIL of the ﬂare arcade. Thus,

– 28 –

it is theoretically possible to accelerate a large number of electrons to higher energies by this
macroscopic process. Our simulated active region is about an order of magnitude larger than a
typical solar active region, however, which suggests that the sizes of the islands would be reduced
by a similar factor in an actual ﬂare. On the other hand, the electron density in our simulation is
signiﬁcantly lower than is typical of the ﬂaring corona. These eﬀects of length scale and plasma
density would compensate each other, at least partially, in a more realistic conﬁguration. These
promising results need to be tested in a conﬁguration with scales and densities characteristic of
actual observed ﬂares. As explained in KAD12, the timescale of our simulation is about 40 times
larger than that of a typical active-region ﬂare. The lifetime of our islands (hundreds of seconds)
corresponds to a few seconds of typical active-region ﬂare times, comparable to the duration of
some of the observed HXR spikes.

Most ﬂare HXRs are produced by bremsstrahlung emitted by energetic electrons colliding with
ambient charged particles. In principle, this process could be calculated from the results of our
simulation, but it is beyond the scope of the present paper. The energetic-electron spectrum must
be convolved with the cross sections for bremsstrahlung emission and the local plasma density to
generate the HXR photon intensity (e.g., Kontar et al. 2011). Within the conﬁnes of MHD, we
plan to use a test particle approach to track the evolving energetic-electron spectrum. However,
a comprehensive determination would require a self-consistent particle calculation including all
sources of acceleration, transport, and interaction with the background plasma (e.g., Liu et al.
2009).

Early islands, such as Island 1, are formed by reconnection of highly sheared ﬁeld lines (large
toroidal ﬁeld). Its mirror ratios are small and most of the particles orbiting this island are transiting
along the helical ﬁeld lines. Transiting particles have the highest energy gains, mostly in the parallel
direction. In 3D, particles on these ﬁeld lines would precipitate toward their footpoints near the
PIL. If these conditions are typical of islands formed in the early, impulsive phase of ﬂares, then
this could help explain the observed HXR footpoint sources observed in a ﬂare.

On the other hand, islands formed later in the ﬂare, such as Island 2, have less sheared ﬁeld.
The large mirror ratios yield a population of predominantly mirroring particles, which are trapped
above the top of the ﬂare arcade until the island collides with the top of the arcade. After the
collision with the arcade, these accelerated particles may ﬁnd a thick target and emit in HXR (Lee
et al. 2013), explaining the observed ﬂare loop-top sources. Note that a small fraction of particles
in Island 1 are also trapped above top of the arcade and some in Island 2 are transiting. Therefore
some emission might be seen at the footpoints and loop-top sources simultaneously. We have not
analyzed the merger of the islands with the top of arcade, which could be a subsequent acceleration
mechanism for those trapped particles (e.g., Sakai 1992; Ko(cid:32)loma´nski & Karlick´y 2007; Milligan
et al. 2010; Karlick´y & B´arta 2011; Nishizuka & Shibata 2013).

Appendix A Analytical Solutions for Mirroring and Transiting Particles

We calculate in detail the energy gained by a particle orbiting along a magnetic ﬂux surface in
a 3D ﬂux rope. A cross section of such a ﬂux rope is shown schematically as a 2D island in Figure
1. The two principal assumptions underlying our approach are: (1) adiabatic invariance, i.e., the
characteristic time over which the magnetic ﬁeld changes is much longer than the time required for
the particle to complete a periodic orbit; and (2) collisionless motion, i.e., the characteristic time
over which the particle suﬀers a signiﬁcant deﬂection of its motion by collisions is much longer than
the orbit time. The validity of these assumptions in the ﬂaring corona is tested in Appendix C
below.

The adiabatic invariants arise from conservation relations for the action A associated with
Hamiltonian coordinates of the motion, q, and their conjugate momenta, p, over a complete orbit
of periodic motion,

(cid:73)

A =

pdq

(A.1)

(e.g., Kruskal 1962; Kulsrud 2005). For a charged particle moving in a magnetic ﬁeld, the ﬁrst
invariant is µ, the magnetic moment, associated with the gyromotion of the particle perpendicular
to the ﬁeld direction. The second invariant is J, the parallel action, associated with the longitudinal
motion of the particle parallel to the ﬁeld direction. They are expressed by

where V⊥ and V(cid:107) are the particle velocity components perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic
ﬁeld, respectively, B is the ﬁeld strength, and l is the arc-length coordinate along the ﬁeld line.
The longitudinal motion is periodic if either (1) the particle is trapped along a ﬁnite length of
the ﬂux rope due to magnetic mirroring at both ends of its orbit, or (2) the ﬂux rope structure
is periodic along its length, as is true in our simple simulation setup with axial symmetry along
the out-of-plane direction in Figure 1. The invariance of µ follows simply from conservation of the
axial magnetic ﬂux passing through the particle’s gyro-orbit; the invariance of J is less intuitive,
and demonstrating it is rather intricate mathematically (Northrop & Teller 1960).

Conservation of the magnetic moment implies that the perpendicular speed |V⊥| varies with

well. To make progress, we adopt the following model proﬁle for the magnetic ﬁeld strength,

B1 and B2 are the minimum and maximum ﬁeld strengths, respectively, along the ﬂux surface, and
L is the length of one full turn of the ﬂux rope. The resulting island is symmetric both left/right
and up/down, as sketched in Figure 1, possessing two equal minima B = B1 at l = 0, L/2 and
two equal maxima B = B2 at l = L/4, 3L/4. All three of the ﬂux surface parameters are time
dependent, in general.

Introducing the total speed, V , and the pitch angle, θ, of the particle, we can write

V⊥ = V sin θ,
V(cid:107) = V cos θ.

If β < 1, i.e., if the particle’s pitch angle θ1 at B = B1 is suﬃciently small, then V(cid:107) in Equation
(A.9) is never zero; this particle is transiting and samples the entire ﬂux surface. On the other
hand, if β ≥ 1, i.e., the pitch angle θ1 is suﬃciently large, then V(cid:107) goes to zero at two positions
within a distance lr < L/4 of l = 0 or l = L/2 (the particle can be trapped on either side of
the island); this particle is mirroring and samples only a subset of the ﬂux surface. The following

This is a transcendental equation in tan θ1 that can be solved numerically. The new pitch angle θ1
of any particle is then a function of its initial pitch angle and of the initial and new properties of
the ﬂux surface: the ﬁeld strength, mirror ratio, and length of one turn of a ﬁeld line. Whether
the particle is transiting or mirroring is determined by the new values of θ1 and the mirror ratio
B2/B1.

The above energy factors show that initially isotropic energies become increasingly anisotropic
as islands evolve. In all cases, the perpendicular energy increases if the minimum ﬁeld strength
increases. The parallel energy changes in a complicated way depending upon the initial pitch angle
of the particle and the three parameters describing the magnetic ﬁeld proﬁle.

There are two useful limiting behaviors for the parallel energy gain: 1) Uniform ﬁeld (B1 = B2,
β → 0); and 2) Strong magnetic trap (B2 >> B1, β → ∞). For these cases, from Equation A.19
and considering the fact that F (a, b, c, 0) = 1, the parallel energy gain takes the following forms

 (Li/L)2 ,

E(cid:107) =

B1 = B2, B1i = B2i;

(A.23)

(Li/L) (B2/B2i)1/2 , B2 >> B1, B2i >> B1i.

For the uniform ﬁeld case, the parallel energy increases if the island contracts, but is not aﬀected
by a change in ﬁeld strength. For the strong magnetic trap, the parallel energy could also increase
if the island contracts, as long as the ﬁeld satisﬁes that B2/B2i > L2/L2
i .

– 33 –

If the initial θi of a particle is equal to zero, then µ = 0 and θ = 0 for all times. This purely
parallel motion has an increase in energy E = E(cid:107) = (Li/L)2. Another special case occurs when
θ1 = π/2, which corresponds to pure gyromotion at the minimum of the ﬁeld, with no parallel
displacement (diﬀerent from θ = π/2 at a mirroring point). In this case, E = E⊥ = B1/B1i.

Appendix B Algebraic Expressions for Uniform Magnetic Field Strength

We now specialize the calculations of Appendix A to derive algebraic expressions for the energy
gain of particles traversing a ﬂux surface with uniform ﬁeld strength.
In this special case, all
particles are transiting, because the mirror ratio is unity. The energy gain can be expressed simply
as functions of the macroscopic quantities: mass density, island length, and magnetic ﬁeld strength.

Consider a ﬂux region, such as those shaded red in Figure 1ab. We assume that its width w is
small and the magnetic ﬁeld is uniform inside the ﬂux surface. The ﬁeld components are poloidal
Bp (in-plane) and toroidal Bt (out-of-plane). Thus, B = B1 =
p. If the 2D projected
length of the ﬂux surface is Lp, the length of one turn of the ﬁeld lines on the ﬂux surface is

There are three macroscopic constraints for particles orbiting inside this ﬂux region: conservation

Ψt ≈ BtwLp = Bt,iwiLp,i,

where n is the plasma density. By combining Equations (B.2), (B.3), and (B.4) we ﬁnd that

The last expression was derived and discussed by Drake et al. (2010).

The energy multiplication factors above show that initially isotropic particle distributions
become increasingly anisotropic as the island perimeter shrinks. Indeed, in the zero guide ﬁeld,
incompressible limit of (B.11), the perpendicular energy (ﬁrst term) actually decreases, but the
parallel energy (second term) increases even faster, so that overall the particle accrues energy. The
decrease in perpendicular energy occurs because, as the island perimeter Lp shrinks, the width w
increases to preserve the enclosed volume, Bp decreases to conserve the enclosed poloidal ﬂux, and
V⊥ decreases to keep the magnetic moment invariant,

Lp

(B.12)

when n = ni, Bt = 0. The increase in parallel energy maintains the constancy of the parallel action
as the perimeter shrinks,

Lp
Lp,i

=

V(cid:107)i
V(cid:107)

,

(B.13)

and an increase in the total particle energy results, as described by Fermi (1949). Allowing for
plasma compression (n (cid:54)= ni), as in (B.10), changes the outcome qualitatively if the width w
decreases, rather than increases, as the perimeter Lp shrinks. This requires a suﬃciently large
density enhancement,

in which case

In this regime, both the perpendicular and parallel energies increase as the island contracts. At
smaller compressions, the perpendicular energy decreases as before, but more slowly than in the
incompressible limit, so that overall the particle energy gain is greater. A ﬁnite out-of-plane com-
ponent of the magnetic ﬁeld (Bt (cid:54)= 0) has the net eﬀect of moderating the impact of changes in

(B.14)

(B.15)

– 35 –

the island perimeter: the parallel energy increases less rapidly, and the perpendicular energy factor
that depends upon Lp decreases less rapidly. Because a ﬁnite Bt also is expected to reduce the
compression n/ni, however, the net eﬀect seems to be a smaller change in the perpendicular energy,
whether the latter increases or decreases.

Appendix C Conditions for Adiabatic Invariance

We now estimate the range of validity of our analytical analysis presented in Appendix A. A
major assumption of those calculations is the adiabatic invariance of the magnetic moment and
parallel action of the accelerated particle. This requires, ﬁrst, that the associated particle orbit
(gyromotion, mirroring, or transiting) be completed much more quickly than the magnetic ﬁeld
changes in time. The characteristic speed for magnetic ﬁeld changes in the islands is the Alfv´en
speed, VA. VA is large compared to the proton (or other ion) thermal speed in the CS of a ﬂare,
where the plasma β is small, so the analysis above is appropriate only for protons and ions that
already are strongly superthermal. This is not necessarily the case for electrons, however, whose
speed Ve at energy Ee is

2 ≈ 5000

where E6 is the thermal energy corresponding to a coronal electron temperature Te = 106 K. The
normalization speed, 5000 km s−1, is comparable to Alfv´en speeds estimated in the corona (e.g., at
ﬁeld strength B = 10 G and number density n = 109 cm−3). Thus, for moderately superthermal
electrons at 1× 106 K and for thermal electrons at 107 K – a typical range of preﬂare temperatures
– the adiabatic invariance of the parallel action is a reasonable approximation. A second condition
also applies, however: the particle must not suﬀer collisions while executing its trajectory. The
mean free path De is

km,

(C.2)

where λ is the Coulomb logarithm (Spitzer 1962). The normalization length, 100 km, is small
compared to the size of ﬂaring regions, but the islands are small structures within the ﬂare CS.
In addition, De varies quadratically with the particle energy, so the mean free path rises rapidly
for moderately superthermal electrons at ambient coronal temperatures, and it is very large for
thermal electrons at enhanced preﬂare temperatures. Thus, again we conclude that the adiabatic
invariance of the parallel action is a reasonable approximation. For at least a signiﬁcant fraction
of the coronal electron population, therefore, our analysis is adequate for a ﬁrst assessment of the
contribution of magnetic-island contraction to particle acceleration in solar ﬂares. In principle, all
particles are accelerated by the mechanisms described in this paper, but the energy gain of those
that do not satisfy the above restrictions cannot be estimated by our equations based on adiabatic
invariance.
