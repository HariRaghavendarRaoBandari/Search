On a class of formal power series and their summability

A. Lastra, J. Sanz and J. R. Sendra

March 3, 2016

Abstract

A family of formal power series, such that its coeﬃcients satisfy a recursion formula, is
characterized in terms of the summability, in the sense of J. P. Ramis, of its elements along
certain well chosen directions. We describe a set of ordinary diﬀerential equations which have,
as a formal solution, one of such formal power series, and also describe the actual solutions
which own such formal power series as Gevrey asymptotic expansion.

The main results are extended into the framework of q−Gevrey series and q−diﬀerence
equations, and also to the case of moment-diﬀerential equations, whose formal solutions have
their coeﬃcients’ growth governed by a so-called strongly regular sequence, appearing as a
generalization of the Gevrey-like sequences.

Key words: Gevrey asymptotic expansions, formal power series, Hankel matrices, summability,
strongly regular sequences, q−Gevrey asymptotics.

Introduction

In 1886, H. Poincar´e put forward the concept of asymptotic expansion at 0 for holomorphic
functions deﬁned in an open sector in C with vertex at the origin. He intended to give an
analytic meaning to formal power series solutions, which were not convergent in general, of
ordinary diﬀerential equations at irregular singular points.

In the late 1970’s, J. P. Ramis developed the theory of k−summability of formal power series
(see [28], [29]). In his work, he proves that every formal power series solution to a linear system
of meromorphic ordinary diﬀerential equation in the complex domain at an irregular singular
point can be decomposed into a ﬁnite product of formal power series, each of which turns out
to be k−summable, for some order k > 0 which depends on the series.

The previous result was only obtained in a theoretical way, and it was improved by J. Ecalle
through the introduction of multisummability (see [5], [6]). It turned out that any formal power
series solution of a (linear or not) meromorphic system of ordinary diﬀerential equations at an
irregular singularity is, indeed, multisummable (see [1], [4], [30]), and an algorithm is available
in order to compute actual (i.e. analytic) solutions departing from formal ones. Moreover,
B. Malgrange gave a method based on the Newton polygon in order to ﬁnd the exact orders
involved in the multisummability process.

In the present study, we provide a simple property of a formal power series in order to
be summable along certain well chosen directions, and also describe a family of (diﬀerential,
moment-diﬀerential or q−diﬀerence) equations for which such a formal power series may appear
as a solution. A closed form of the actual solution is determined, and it is constructed by means

of the elements provided by a recurrence relation satisﬁed by the coeﬃcients in the formal power
series from some index on. Some of our results rest on a characterization, in terms of Hankel
matrices, of the formal power series which locally represent a rational function (see [34]).

The layout of this work reads as follows.
Section 2 is mainly devoted to give a brief summary of the main deﬁnitions and results
concerning classical Gevrey asymptotic expansions of functions deﬁned in sectors of the complex
plane, including the related concept and technique of k−summability in a direction of formal
power series of some Gevrey order. Moreover, we recall some results relating Hankel matrices
and power series which locally represent rational functions. As our ﬁrst result, in Section 3
we give a suﬃcient condition for the 1−summability of a formal power series.
In Section 4,
we describe a set of polynomial diﬀerential equations which admit one of the previous formal
power series as solutions, and state the main result of the present work (Theorem 4.3). Next, in
Theorem 4.8 we extend our considerations to a particular type of formal power series of some
Gevrey order s ∈ N, thanks to the crucial fact, due to W. Balser, that the termwise product of
sequences of moments of some Gevrey order is again a sequence of moments.

In Sections 5 and 6 we indicate the main facts that allow us to consider new situations in
this same respect. The ﬁrst one of them is devoted to the study of some solutions for so-called
moment diﬀerential equations, in whose deﬁnition enters the sequence of moments of a kernel
function associated with a strongly regular sequence, a generalization of Gevrey sequences which
allows for an asymptotic theory where one can put forward a satisfactory concept of summability
(see the recent work by the second author [32] and by the ﬁrst two authors and S. Malek [16]),
similar to the one developed by J.P. Ramis. The second one of these new insights corresponds
to some formal power series solutions of a class of q−diﬀerence equations. Here, the q−Gevrey
asymptotics and q−summability theory, mainly studied by J. P. Ramis and Ch. Zhang (see [35]),
play a prominent role. Unlike in the previous approaches, there is no unique sum naturally
associated with a formal q−Gevrey series in a direction, what leads to the speciﬁcation of a
natural sum through a prescribed variation.

2 Preliminaries

2.1 Classical results on k−summability of formal power series

This section is devoted to a general overview of the classical notions of Gevrey asymptotics and
k−summability. We provide the results without proof, which can be found in standard works
on this topic, such as [2].

Let R denote the Riemann surface of the logarithm. Let θ > 0, d ∈ R and r > 0. We write

Sd(θ, r) for the bounded sector, with vertex at the origin and bisecting direction d, given by

Sd(θ, r) = {z ∈ R : |arg(z) − d| <

πθ
2

, 0 < |z| < r}.

We also consider unbounded sectors

Sd(θ) := {z ∈ R : |arg(z) − d| <

θπ
2

}.

Deﬁnition 2.1. A sectorial region Gd(α) with bisecting direction d ∈ R and opening α π will
be a domain in R such that Gd(α) ⊂ Sd(α), and for every β ∈ (0, α) there exists ρ = ρ(β) > 0
with Sd(β, ρ) ⊂ Gd(α). In particular, sectors are sectorial regions.
A sector T is a bounded proper subsector of a sectorial region G (denoted by T ≺ G) whenever
the radius of T is ﬁnite and T \ {0} ⊂ G.

We write N0 = {0, 1, 2, . . . } and N = {1, 2, . . . }. O(S) will stand for the set of holomorphic

functions in S.

3

Deﬁnition 2.2. Let G = Gd(θ) be a sectorial region. We say a function f ∈ O(G) admits a
p=0 fpzp ∈ C[[z]] as asymptotic expansion in G (as z tends to 0)

if for every T ≺ G and all N ∈ N0 there exists a constant c = c(N, T ) > 0 with

(formal) power series ˆf (z) = P∞

z ∈ T.

N −1

Xp=0

fpzp(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

One can prove that, if the formal power series ˆf in the previous deﬁnition exists, then it is
unique, so ˆf is known as the asymptotic expansion of f in G. Moreover, the set of functions
which admit asymptotic expansion in a sector turns out to be a diﬀerential algebra (i.e.
it
is closed for sums, products and diﬀerentiation), and the map f 7→ ˆf is a homomorphism of
diﬀerential algebras.

The theory of summability of formal solutions of diﬀerential equations is intimately related
to Gevrey sequences, deﬁned by (p!α)p≥0 for some α > 0. Gevrey asymptotics is characterized
by specifying the form of the constant c = c(N, T ) in (1) as follows.

Deﬁnition 2.3. Under the assumptions of Deﬁnition 2.2, we say f admits ˆf as its Gevrey
asymptotic expansion of order s > 0 if for every T ≺ G there exist positive constants C = C(T )
and A = A(T ) such that (1) is satisﬁed with c of the form

c = CAN N !s, N ∈ N.

The set of all functions which admit Gevrey asymptotic expansion of some order s > 0 is

again a diﬀerential algebra.

Deﬁnition 2.4. A formal power series ˆf (z) = Pp≥0 fpzp is of Gevrey order s ≥ 0 if |fp| ≤

CApp!s for some C, A > 0.

In case a function f admits ˆf as its Gevrey asymptotic expansion of positive order s in some

sectorial region, then ˆf is of Gevrey order s.

Watson’s Lemma (see [33]) states that, given ˆf (z) ∈ C[[z]] of Gevrey order s and a sectorial
region G with opening larger than sπ, there is at most one function f ∈ O(G) which admits ˆf
as its Gevrey asymptotic expansion of Gevrey order s in G. In case such function f exists, we
say that ˆf is 1/s−summable in direction d, having f as its 1/s−sum in such direction (or in G).
This procedure is known as 1/s−summability.

The set of 1/s−summable formal power series along a direction d turns out to be a diﬀerential

algebra, and summability behaves well with the operations.

Example 2.5. A classical example is given by the Euler series

ˆg(z) = Xp≥0

(−1)pp!zp+1,

which turns out to be a formal solution of the diﬀerential equation

(2)

z2y′ + y = z.

4

On the other hand, the function

g(z) = Z ∞

e−t/z
1 + t

is holomorphic in the sector S0(1), and it is not diﬃcult to check that g is a solution of (2).
Observe that

Indeed, by rotating the half-line of integration the deﬁnition of g can be analytically extended
to wider sectors in which g is the unique (by Watson’s Lemma) holomorphic function admitting
ˆg as its Gevrey asymptotic expansion of order 1.

The Borel-Laplace k−summability method, exhibited in the next result and which can be

found in [2], shows how one can recover g departing from ˆg.

Theorem 2.6. Let k > 0 and ˆf (z) = Pp≥0 fpzp be a formal power series of Gevrey order 1/k,

so that the series

ˆBk ˆf (z) = Xp≥0

Γ(1 + p/k)

fp

zp

(the formal Borel transform of ˆf of order k) has positive radius of convergence, and deﬁnes a
holomorphic function g deﬁned on some neighborhood of the origin. Then, the next statements
are equivalent:

1. There exist a sector S = Sd(θ, r), with θ > 1/k and r > 0, and f ∈ O(S) which admits ˆf

as its Gevrey asymptotic expansion of Gevrey order 1/k in S.

2. There exists ε > 0 such that g admits analytic continuation G into a sector of inﬁnite

radius Vd(ε), and there exist c1, c2 > 0 with

(3)

|G(z)| ≤ c1 exp(cid:16)c2|z|k(cid:17) ,

z ∈ Vd(ε).

If these statements hold, then

f (z) = z−kZ ∞(d)

0

G(u)e−(u/z)k

kuk−1du

whenever both sides of the equality are deﬁned, and we say that ˆf is k−summable in direction
d, and that f is the k−sum of ˆf in that direction.

The integral transform involved in the statement of the previous result has to be seen as the

line integral along the path parameterized by s ∈ (0, ∞) 7→ seid.

This last result provides an algorithm which departs from a formal power series ˆf of some
Gevrey order (maybe the formal solution of some ODE), and provides, under appropriate prop-
erties of the Borel transform of ˆf , a holomorphic function f deﬁned in a ﬁnite sector with vertex
at the origin which admits ˆf as its Gevrey asymptotic expansion of the corresponding Gevrey
order.

5

Remark 2.7. In the previous example, the procedure is applied to ˆf (z) = Pp≥0(−1)pp!zp, for

which (with the notation of the example) ˆg(z) = z ˆf (z) holds. Then the 1−sum of ˆf in direction
0, say f , is computed according to the previous result, and we have that g(z) = zf (z) for every
z ∈ S0(1).

It is worth mentioning that, for the sake of brevity, the results in Section 3 and Section 4 will
be considered in detail only for Gevrey order 1. We will indicate how to modify our arguments
in order to deal with any other Gevrey order s ∈ N.

2.2 Hankel matrices and formal power series

In this section, we recall the deﬁnition and general properties of Hankel matrices, and relate
them to formal power series. Although these are quite classical, we include them for the sake of
clarity. All these deﬁnitions and results can be found in Chapter XV, Section 10 in [7]; see also
Section 7.2 in [34], and the references therein.

Deﬁnition 2.8. Let D = (dp)p∈N be a sequence of complex numbers. The inﬁnite Hankel matrix
generated by D is H∞(D) = (hij )i,j∈N, where hij := di+j−1 for i, j ∈ N. Given n ∈ N, the ﬁnite
Hankel matrix of order n generated by D is deﬁned by

Hn(D) :=





We say a Hankel matrix is proper if it has ﬁnite rank.

The next result and its corollary provide a characterization of formal power series with

complex coeﬃcients in order to provide the Taylor series at 0 of some rational function.

Theorem 2.9. Let D = (dp)p∈N be a sequence of complex numbers, and H = H(D) its associated
inﬁnite Hankel matrix. The following statements are equivalent:

1. H is proper of rank r, for some r ∈ N.

2. There exist a1, . . . , ar ∈ C and r ∈ N such that

dj = a1dj−1 + a2dj−2 + · · · + ardj−r,

for every j > r, and r is the smallest integer for which such a recursion is available.

3. det(Hr(D)) 6= 0 and det(Hj(D)) = 0 for every j ∈ N, j > r.

4. There exists a rational function R(z) = g(z)

h(z) ∈ C(z), where g, h are relatively prime,

deg(g) ≥ deg(h) and with h(0) 6= 0 and g(0) = 0, such that R(z) has

as its Taylor expansion at 0. In addition to this, rank(H) = deg(g).

Corollary 2.10. Let R(z) = Pp≥1 dpzp be a formal power series with complex coeﬃcients. If

there exist r ∈ N and a1, a2, . . . , ar ∈ C such that

dj = a1dj−1 + · · · + ardj−r

for every j > r, and r is the smallest integer for which such a recursion is available, then
R(z) ∈ C(z) and (up to a constant factor) we have

R(z) =

d1z + (d2 − d1a1)z2 + · · · + (dr − dr−1a1 − · · · − d1ar−1)zr

1 − a1z − · · · − arzr

.

3 A suﬃcient condition for summability

The main aim in this section is to provide a suﬃcient condition for the summability of a formal
power series. The procedure heavily rests on Corollary 2.10.

Proposition 3.1. Let ˆf (z) = Pp≥1 fpzp be a complex formal power series such that there exist

r ∈ N and a1, . . . , ar ∈ C with

(4)

fj = a1jfj−1 + a2j(j − 1)fj−2 + · · · + arj(j − 1) . . . (j − r + 1)fj−r

or, equivalently,

(5)

fj
j!

=

j−1

Xk=j−r

aj−k

fk
k!

for every j > r (and r is the smallest integer for which such a recursion is available). Then,
ˆf is 1−summable along any direction d but those given by the arguments of the roots of the
polynomial

1 − a1z − · · · − arzr.

Proof. One can follow the steps indicated in Theorem 2.6 in order to prove 1−summability. We
consider the formal Borel operator of order 1 applied to ˆf . This yields

ˆB1 ˆf (z) = Xp≥1

fp
p!

zp.

So, if we put dp := fp/p! for every p ∈ N, from assumption (4) one has

dj = a1dj−1 + a2dj−2 + · · · + ardj−r,

for every j > r, and r is the smallest integer with this property. One can apply Corollary 2.10
to deduce that there exists a rational function R(z) ∈ C(z) which has ˆB1 ˆf (z) as its Taylor
expansion at 0 (and so this series converges around the origin). We now check 2. in Theorem 2.6
to complete the procedure. Since the denominator of R(z) is 1 − a1r − · · · − arzr, the function
R can be analytically continued into any sector of inﬁnite radius with small enough opening,
provided the bisecting direction d of this sector does not belong to the set of arguments (modulo
2π) of the roots of the polynomial 1 − a1z − · · · − arzr. Moreover, R is of exponential order 0 in
every such sector, so that it satisﬁes (3) there for every k > 0, and the conclusion follows.

Example 3.2. The classical formal power series considered in Example 2.5 is suitable for the
application of the previous result. Indeed, we write as before

7

(−1)pp!zp+1 = zXp≥1
If one deﬁnes fp = (−1)pp! for p ∈ N and a1 = −1, then

ˆg(z) = Xp≥0

(−1)pp!zp = z ˆf (z).

fj = ja1fj−1,

for every j > 1. Proposition 3.1 holds for r = 1 and one concludes that ˆf is 1−summable in
every direction d but the argument of the zeros of the equation 1− a1z = 0, which is the negative
real axis. The sum of ˆf in direction d is deﬁned by

f (z) =

1

z Z ∞(d)

0

1

1 + u

e−u/zdu,

which may be extended to a sector S := Sd(θ, M ), for some θ > 1 and M > 0, by suitably
rotating the half-line of integration. The algebraic properties of 1−summable functions in a
direction allow us to aﬃrm that ˆg is 1−summable in direction d, zf (z) being its sum in S.

We conclude with a generalization of the previous example.

Corollary 3.3. Let a ∈ C and h ∈ N. The formal power series

ˆf (z) = Xp≥0

(hp + 1)!apzhp+1

is 1−summable in any direction d which is not an argument for any of the h−th roots of 1/a.

Proof. Let us write fp for the coeﬃcient of zp in ˆf . One can easily prove that

fj = j(j − 1) . . . (j − h + 1)afj−h

for every j > h. So, one can take r = h, a1 = a2 = · · · = ah−1 = 0 and ah = a, and apply
Proposition 3.1. One obtains that ˆf is 1−summable in every direction but the ones given by the
arguments of the complex numbers which verify 1 − azh = 0, i.e. the h−th roots of 1/a.

4 Characterization of the summability of certain formal solu-

tions of ODEs

This section is devoted to the study of necessary and suﬃcient conditions for a formal power
series to be a solution of a family of ordinary diﬀerential equations. Moreover, this formal
solution turns out to be summable along appropriate directions which are determined.

For this purpose, we give some properties on formal Borel transform which can be found in

the literature (see Proposition 4 in [15], for instance). Its proof is direct, so we omit it.

Lemma 4.1. For every ˆf (z) ∈ C[[z]], the following formal equality holds:

τ ˆB1( ˆf )(τ ) = ˆB1((z2∂z + z) ˆf (z))(τ ).

We state the main result of our work. It is worth noting that the forthcoming implication

(2) ⇒ (3) is a generalization of Proposition 3.1.

(1) ˆf is the formal solution of P (z2∂z + z)y = g(z), for some polynomial P ∈ C[z] with

P (0) 6= 0 and some g ∈ C{z}.

(2) There exist r ∈ N, complex numbers a1, . . . , ar and positive constants C, M such that

(3) ˆf is 1−summable in any direction d but the arguments of the roots of a polynomial

h(z) = 1 − a1z − · · · − arzr,

and its sum, say f ∈ O(Sd) for some sector Sd of opening larger than π, is an actual
solution of the problem P (z2∂z + z)y = g(z), for some polynomial P ∈ C[z], with P (0) 6= 0,
and some g ∈ C{z} which do not depend on the choice of d.

Proof. (1) ⇒ (2) We assume that ˆf is a formal solution of P (z2∂z + z)y = g(z) for some poly-
nomial P ∈ C[z], with P (0) 6= 0, and some g ∈ C{z}. Up to multiplication by a constant factor,
we may assume without loss of generality that P (z) = 1 − Pr
p=0 bpzp.

(2) ⇒ (3) Let us consider the formal Borel transform of order 1 of ˆf , ˆB1 ˆf (z) = Pp≥1 fpzp/p!,

and deﬁne the polynomial h(z) = 1 − a1z − · · · − arzr. If we put f0 := 0,. . . ,f1−r := 0, we may

Observe that, by virtue of the estimates in (6), the series on the right-hand side, say b(z) =

Pj≥1 bjzj/j!, deﬁnes an entire function of exponential order less than or equal to 1. So, the

function b(z)/h(z) is holomorphic in C with the roots of h deleted (in particular, it is holomorphic
in a neighborhood of the origin), and it is of exponential order less than or equal to 1 in any
open unbounded sector with vertex at 0 and not containing any of these roots. This means that
ˆf is 1−summable in every direction d which is not an argument of any of the roots of h, as
desired. Let f be the 1-sum of ˆf in an appropriate direction d ∈ R, deﬁned in a sector Sd of
opening larger than π. According to previous computations, we see that the coeﬃcient of zj in
h(z2∂z + z) ˆf is given by

and this equals bj when we take into account that b(z) is the right-hand side in (7). Put

g(z) := Pj≥1 bjzj, which belongs to C{z}. At this point one has that h(z2∂z + z) ˆf (z) − g(z) is

the null formal power series. Since f admits ˆf as its Gevrey asymptotic expansion of order 1 in
Sd, the classical properties of Gevrey asymptotic expansions (see Theorem 19 and Theorem 20
in [2]) imply that h(z2∂z + z)f (z) − g(z) admits a null Gevrey asymptotic expansion of order 1
in a sector ˜Sd of opening larger than π and bisected by direction d. Watson’s Lemma allows us
to conclude that h(z2∂z + z)f (z) − g(z) is the null function, so f is a solution of the equation
h(z2∂z + z)y = g(z) in Sd.
(3) ⇒ (1) Since ˆf is the asymptotic expansion of f in a suitable sector, it is readily deduced
from the elementary properties of asymptotic expansions that, whenever f solves the diﬀerential
equation, ˆf also solves the corresponding formal one.

As a consequence of Proposition 3.1, one can easily deduce the following version of the

previous result.

ments are equivalent:

Theorem 4.3. Let ˆf (z) = Pp≥1 fpzp ∈ C[[z]] be a formal power series. The following state-
1.- ˆf is the formal solution of P (z2∂z + z)y = Q(z), for some polynomials P, Q ∈ C[z], with

P (0) 6= 0.

2.- There exist r ∈ N and a1, . . . , ar ∈ C such that ˆf veriﬁes the recursion formula (4) for

every j > r and r is the smallest integer for which this property holds.

3.- ˆf is 1−summable along any direction d but the ones of the complex numbers which are the

roots of the polynomial

1 − arz − · · · − z1zr,

for some r ∈ N and a1, . . . , ar ∈ C.
Its sum, say f ∈ O(Sd) for some sector Sd of
opening larger than π, is an actual solution of the problem P (z2∂z + z)y = Q(z), for some
polynomials P, Q ∈ C[z], with P (0) 6= 0, which do not depend on d.

p=1 apzp, with ar0 6= 0, and Q(z) =

which should equal 0 as long as j > s. So, in case s ≤ r0 we put r := r0, and (5) holds for every
j > r. Whenever s > r0 we deﬁne r := s and ar0+1 := 0, . . . , as := 0, in such a way that (5)
again holds for every j > r. In both cases, r is the smallest value for which this property holds.
(2) ⇒ (3) It suﬃces to apply Proposition 3.1.
(3) ⇒ (1) It is a direct consequence of the properties of Gevrey asymptotic expansions.

Remark 4.4. From the proof of Theorem 4.3, one also obtains the way one can construct the
ordinary diﬀerential equation from the recursion formula, and vice versa.

Remark 4.5. Regarding Example 2.5, under the deﬁnitions considered therein, the result is

valid when taking P (z) = 1 + z, Q(z) = 1 and the formal power series ˆh(z) = Pp≥0(−1)pp!zp.

If one tries to generalize the previous results for a general Gevrey order while still considering
only equations given by polynomial diﬀerential operators, it is natural to restrict attention to
values s = 1/k ∈ N, s ≥ 2, for the Gevrey order. In this case, by a straightforward computation
one can get the following analogue of Lemma 4.1.

Lemma 4.6. For every ˆf (z) ∈ C[[z]], consider the modiﬁed Borel transform of order k = 1/s,
where s ∈ N, s ≥ 2, given by

˜Bk ˆf (z) = Xp≥0

fp
p!s zp

(observe that ˜B1 = ˆB1). The following formal equality holds:

τ ˜Bk( ˆf )(τ ) = ˜Bk(cid:0)z(z∂z + 1)s ˆf (z)(cid:1)(τ ).

In the following we take into account that not only the sequences (Γ(1+sp))p∈N0 and (p!s)p∈N0
are equivalent (i.e. there exist B, C > 0 such that Bpp!s ≤ Γ(1 + sp) ≤ C pp!s for every p ∈ N0),
but the second one is also a sequence of moments for a kernel of summability, as deﬁned by W.
Balser [2, Section 5.5]. This last statement stems from the fact that (p!)p∈N0 is the sequence of
moments of the exponential,

p! := Z ∞

0

tp−1 exp(t)dt,

p ∈ N0,

and any other sequence which may be expressed as a ﬁnite term-by-term product of several
moment sequences is again a moment sequence (see [2, Theorem 31]). Moreover, in this case
one has the following equivalent rephrasing of summability in a direction.

Theorem 4.7. Let ˆf (z) = Pp≥0 fpzp be a formal power series of Gevrey order s = 1/k ∈ N,

so that the series

˜Bk ˆf (z) = Xp≥0

fp
p!s zp

has positive radius of convergence, and consequently deﬁnes a holomorphic function g in some
neighborhood of the origin. Then, the next statements are equivalent:

11

1. ˆf is k−summable in a direction d.

2. There exists ε > 0 such that g admits analytic continuation G into a sector of inﬁnite

radius Sd(ε), and there exist c1, c2 > 0 with

|G(z)| ≤ c1 exp(cid:16)c2|z|k(cid:17) ,

z ∈ Sd(ε).

Moreover, there exists a kernel of k−summability e(z), subject to standard properties (see W.
Balser [2, Chapter 5]), in particular

p!s := Z ∞

0

tp−1e(t)dt,

p ∈ N0,

is given by

as long as both sides of the equality are deﬁned.

(with f0 := 0,. . . ,f1−r := 0). By (8), the series on the right-hand side deﬁnes an entire function of

in every direction d which is not an argument of any of the roots of h. Moreover, the k−sum of
ˆf is a solution of the diﬀerential equation, again by Watson’s Lemma.

5 Ultraholomorphic Carleman classes

A general procedure of summability of formal power series has been developed recently in [32],
where bounds for the asymptotics are given in terms of a general sequence M = (Mp)p∈N0
satisfying certain conditions that resemble those veriﬁed by the powers of the factorials. The
aim of this section is to recall these facts and to obtain a result similar to the previous ones in
this context.

In what follows, M = (Mp)p∈N0 stands for a sequence of positive real numbers, with M0 = 1.

Deﬁnition 5.1. We say M is strongly regular if the following hold:

(i) M is logarithmically convex (for short, (lc)), that is,

M 2

p ≤ Mp−1Mp+1,

p ∈ N.

(ii) M is of moderate growth (brieﬂy, (mg)), i.e., there exists A > 0 such that

Mp+q ≤ Ap+qMpMq,

p, q ∈ N0.

(iii) M satisﬁes the strong non-quasianalyticity condition (for short, (snq)), that is, there exists

B > 0 such that

Mq

(q + 1)Mq+1

≤ B

Mp
Mp+1

,

Xq≥p

p ∈ N0.

The conditions in the previous deﬁnition are quite classical and they naturally appear in
the literature concerning the study of so-called Carleman ultradiﬀerentiable or ultraholomorphic
classes, consisting of C∞ (respectively, analytic) functions whose derivatives’ growth is controlled
mainly by the given sequence M.

Indeed, H.-J. Petzsche [25] proved that the Borel map, sending a C∞ function deﬁned in
a closed interval I ⊆ R to the sequence of its derivatives at some interior point in I, when
deﬁned between a Carleman ultradiﬀerentiable class and the corresponding space of sequences,
is surjective if, and only if, M veryﬁes (snq). Condition (mg) provides stability under ultradif-
ferentiable operators and separativity (see [11] and [20]), and condition (lc) is the condition for
an ultradiﬀerentiable class of functions to be an algebra or closed under composition. For more
details on these and other properties satisﬁed by M, we refer to [13, 26, 27].

Example 5.2. It is worth remarking that the Gevrey sequence of positive order s > 0, (p!s)p≥0,
turns out to be a strongly regular sequence. Indeed, for every α > 0 and β ∈ R, the sequence
m=0 logβ(e + p))p≥0 is strongly regular (in case β < 0, after some inessential changes like
)p≥0, which will

scaling or adjusting a ﬁnite number of terms). For q > 1 the sequence (q
be considered next, is not strongly regular for it does not satisfy (mg).

At this point, a more general concept of asymptotic expansions in a sector can be stated.

13

region with vertex at the origin and f ∈ O(G). We say f admits ˆf (z) = P∞

Deﬁnition 5.3. Let M = (Mp)p≥0 be a sequence of positive real numbers, let G be a sectorial
n=0 anzn ∈ C[[z]] as
its M−asymptotic expansion in G if for every proper and bounded subsector T of G there exist
A = A(T ) > 0 and C = C(T ) > 0 such that for every n ∈ N0 one has

n−1

Xp=0

(cid:12)(cid:12)f (z) −

apzp(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ CAnMn|z|n,

z ∈ T.

We will write f ∼M P∞

k=0 akzk in G. ˜AM(G) stands for the space of functions admitting
M−asymptotic expansion in G, and it is called a Carleman ultraholomorphic class (in the sense
of Roumieu).

Accordingly, we deﬁne the class of sequences

ΛM = n(µp)p∈N0 ∈ CN0 : there exist C, A > 0 with |µp| ≤ CApp!Mp, p ∈ N0o.

Then, it is easy to check that the map ˜B : ˜AM(G) −→ ΛM given by

˜B(f ) := (f (p)(0))p∈N0 ,

is well deﬁned, and it will be called the asymptotic Borel map.
Deﬁnition 5.4. A function f ∈ ˜AM(G) is said to be ﬂat if ˜B(f ) is the null sequence or, in other
words, f ∼M ˆ0, where ˆ0 denotes the null power series. We say that ˜AM(G) is quasianalytic if it
does not contain nontrivial ﬂat functions; in other words, the asymptotic Borel map is injective
in the class.

As a consequence of Taylor’s formula and Cauchy’s integral formula for the derivatives, we
have the following result (see [2] for a proof in the Gevrey case, which may be easily adapted to
this more general situation).

Proposition 5.5. Let G be a sectorial region and f : G → C a holomorphic function. The
following are equivalent:

(i) f ∈ ˜AM(G).

(ii) For every T ≺ G there exist CT , AT > 0 such that for every p ∈ N0 and z ∈ T , one has

|f (p)(z)| ≤ CT Ap

T p!Mp.

This allows one to consider a diﬀerent approach, introducing ultraholomorphic classes deﬁned
by imposing uniform bounds on the derivatives of its elements in the whole sector. The study
of quasianalyticity in this situation has been made by several authors, both in one [24, 19, 12]
or several variables [9, 17]. With the help of these results, the quantity

ω(M) := inf{γ > 0 : ˜AM(G0(γ)) is quasianalytic}

may be computed, see [32, 10].

Proposition 5.6. For a lorarithmically convex sequence M, we have

ω(M) = lim inf
p→∞

log(Mp+1/Mp)

log(p)

,

which turns out to be an element in [0, ∞]. Moreover, if M is a strongly regular sequence, then
ω(M) ∈ (0, ∞).

14

In the rest of this section we follow [32, 16, 10]. We need to introduce some auxiliary
functions, associated with the sequence M, in terms of which one may indicate suﬃcient (and
non-restrictive) conditions for an agreeable summability theory to be available in this context.

Deﬁnition 5.7. Let M = (Mp)p∈N0 be a strongly regular sequence. One can deﬁne the function
M : (0, ∞) → R by

(9)

M (t) = Z t

0

#{j : Mj+1 ≤ rMj}

r

dr = sup
p∈N0

tp

Mp(cid:1),

log(cid:0)

and put dM(t) =

log(M (t))

log(t)

(well deﬁned and with positive values for large enough t).

The concept of proximate order, relevant in the theory of growth of holomorphic functions

in sectors (see, for example,

[8]), plays a prominent role in the following result.

Corollary 5.8 (Watson’s Lemma, [32]). Suppose M is strongly regular and such that dM(r) is
a proximate order, and let γ > 0 be given. Then, ˜AM(G0(γ)) is quasianalytic if, and only if,
γ > ω(M).

So, it is important to know whether dM(r) is a proximate order or not.

Proposition 5.9 ([10]). Let M be a strongly regular sequence, and dM(r) its associated function.
The following are equivalent:

(i) dM(r) is a proximate order,

(ii) lim
p→∞

log(Mp+1/Mp)

log(p)

= ω(M).

Every example of strongly regular sequence appearing in the applications satisﬁes (ii), so the
condition imposed in the previous Watson’s Lemma does not seem to be restrictive (although,
indeed, there exist strongly regular sequences for which (ii) fails to hold). We are ready for the
deﬁnition of summability in a direction in this context.

Deﬁnition 5.10 ([16]). Let d ∈ R. We say ˆf = Pp≥0
zp is M−summable in direction d if
there exist a sectorial region G = Gd(γ), with γ > ω(M), and a function f ∈ ˜AM(G) such that
f ∼M ˆf .

fp
p!

In this case, we have (fp)p∈N0 ∈ ΛM, and according to Watson’s Lemma, f is unique with

the property stated and will be called the M−sum of ˆf in direction d.

As it may be found in [16], whenever dM is a proximate order one may construct pairs of

kernel functions e(z) and E(z), and the moment function associated to e(z), that is,

m(λ) := Z ∞

0

tλ−1e(t)dt, ℜ(λ) > 0,

in terms of which to deﬁne suitable Laplace- and Borel-like formal and analytic transforms
which allow for the reconstruction of the sum of a summable series in a direction. The so-called
sequence of moments m = (m(p))p∈N0 turns out to be equivalent to M (in the sense, as said
before, that there exist B, C > 0 such that BpMp ≤ m(p) ≤ C pMp for every p ∈ N0). Indeed,

the function f described in Deﬁnition 5.10 can be constructed as the M−analogue of Laplace
transform,

f (z) = Z ∞(d)

where the function g is the analytic continuation into an unbounded sector S bisected by d of
zp, a series which is convergent

the formal Borel transform of ˆf , namely ˜Bm( ˆf ) := Pp≥0

around the origin and whose continuation has suitable growth so that the previous integral is
well deﬁned. To be precise, for every unbounded proper subsector T of S there exist r, C1, C2 > 0
such that

(10)

|g(z)| ≤ C1 exp(cid:0)M (C2|z|)(cid:1),

for every z ∈ T with |z| ≥ r, where M is the function introduced in (9).

The forthcoming generalization of the derivative operator was ﬁrstly studied by W. Balser
and M. Yoshino [3]: Given a sequence of moments m = (m(p))p≥0 as before, one can deﬁne the
moment diﬀerential operator ∂m on formal power series with complex coeﬃcients by

∂m
Xp≥0

fp

m(p)

zp
 = Xp≥0

fp+1
m(p)

zp,

and this deﬁnition may be proved (see [21, 16]) to extend to functions holomorphic around the
origin. Observe that this operator coincides with the usual derivative when working with the
sequence m(p) := p!, moments of the function e(z) = e−z.

Moment partial diﬀerential equations, related to these operators, have already been studied
in [3] and by S. Michalik[22, 23], in the case that (m(p))p∈N0 is equivalent to a Gevrey sequence,
and in the general case in [16].

The next results provide new insight for some kind of ordinary moment diﬀerential equations.

Lemma 5.11. Let M be a strongly regular sequence such that dM is a proximate order, e be a
kernel function associated with M and m = (m(p))p∈N0 be the sequence of its moments. Then,
for every formal power series ˆf ∈ C[[z]] one has

τ ˆBm( ˆf )(τ ) = ˆBm(cid:0)z∂m(z ˆf (z)(cid:1)(τ ).

The proof follows straightforward from the deﬁnitions of ˆBm and ∂m. In the forthcoming

statement, for a monomial λn the expression (cid:0)z∂m(z · )(cid:1)n is to be understood as the operator

computing the n−th iteration of the operator z∂m(z · ) that multiplies by z, applies ∂m and again
multiplies by z.

those in (10). The same is true then for the function b(z)/h(z) (holomorphic in C except for
the roots of h) in any open unbounded sector with vertex at 0 and not containing any of these
roots. So, ˆf is M−summable in every direction d which is not an argument of any of the roots
of h, as desired. Let f be the M−sum of ˆf in an appropriate direction d ∈ R, deﬁned in a sector

and products guarantee that h(z∂m(z · ))f (z) − g(z) admits null M−asymptotic expansion in
˜Sd, and by Watson’s Lemma we conclude that f solves the equation h(z∂m(z · ))y = g(z) in Sd.

6 Some results for q−diﬀerence equations

Concerning summability, one can deal with formal power series whose coeﬃcients’ growth is not
governed by a strongly regular sequence. This is the case of the formal power series

Xp≥1

p(p−1)

which is a formal solution of the q−diﬀerence equation zy(qz) + y(z) = z, but whose coeﬃcients
have a too fast rate of growth. This behavior is quite natural when regarding q−diﬀerence
equations (see [18], [31] for example). The next deﬁnitions can be found in [35].

Deﬁnition 6.1. Let S = Sd(θ, r) be a sector and q ∈ R with q > 1. We say a function f ∈ O(S)
admits a q−Gevrey asymptotic expansion in S if there exist C, A > 0 such that the constant c
in (1) is of the form

CAN q

, N ∈ N0.

A formal power series with complex coeﬃcients, ˆf (z) = Pp≥0 fpzp, is said to be q-Gevrey

for every p ∈ N0 and suitable C, A > 0. In this case, its formal

Jacobi theta function naturally appears in the context of q−diﬀerence equations, for it satisﬁes
the functional equation zqy(z) = y(qz). Moreover, its growth at inﬁnity is stated in the following
Lemma (see [14] for the details).

Lemma 6.2. There exists C > 0 such that for every z ∈ C⋆ one has

|θ(z)| ≤ C(1 + |z|) exp(cid:0)

log2(|z|)
2 log(q) (cid:1).

Suppose a formal power series ˆf (z) = Pp≥0 fpzp is q-Gevrey, and its formal q−Borel trans-

form converges to a holomorphic function ϕ (deﬁned in a neighborhood of the origin) which
can be analytically continued to a function Φ in an unbounded sector S with bisecting direction
d ∈ R. In addition to this, we assume there exist C > 0, µ ∈ R verifying that

It is important to describe a q−analog of the properties of formal Borel transform.

Lemma 6.3. For every ˆf (z) ∈ C[[z]], the following formal equality holds:

τ ˆBq( ˆf )(τ ) = ˆBq((zσq) ˆf (z))(τ ),

where σq stands for the dilation operator z 7→ qz extended in the natural manner to formal power
series.

One can adapt the main result in the previous sections for this type of asymptotics.

Theorem 6.4. Let ˆf (z) = Pp≥1 fpzp ∈ C[[z]] be a formal power series.

and some g ∈ C{z} which do not depend on the choice of d, in the sense that P (zσq)f − g
admits ˆ0 as its q−Gevrey asymptotic expansion in Sd.

Proof. We omit the details, being analogous to those of the proof of Theorems 4.3 and 5.12.

(1) ⇒ (2) If ˆf is a formal solution of the equation with P (z) = 1 − Pr

(2) ⇒ (3) If we put h(z) = 1 − a1z − · · · − arzr and f0 := 0,. . . ,f1−r := 0, it is clear that

h(z) · ˆBq ˆf (z) = Xj≥1(cid:16)

By (14), the series on the right-hand side, say b(z) = Pj≥1 bjzj/qj(j−1)/2, deﬁnes an entire
function which, thanks to Lemma 6.2, is bounded above by CΘ(A|z|) for suitable A, C > 0.
The function b(z)/h(z) is similarly estimated in any open unbounded sector with vertex at 0
and not containing any of the roots of h. This entails ˆf is q−Gevrey summable in every direction
d which is not an argument of any of the roots of h.

Let f be the q−Gevrey sum of ˆf in an appropriate direction d ∈ R, deﬁned in a sector Sd of

opening larger than 2π. The coeﬃcient of zj in h(zσq) ˆf is

fj − qj(j−1)/2

j−1

Xk=j−r

aj−k

fk

qk(k−1)/2

= bj.

Put g(z) := Pj≥1 bjzj, which belongs to C{z}. Since h(zσq) ˆf (z) − g(z) is the null series, we see
that h(zσq)f (z) − g(z) admits null q−Gevrey asymptotic expansion in ˜Sd.
(3) ⇒ (1) Trivial.

Remark 6.5. In this remark we recall the concept of variation stated in [35]: Given a sector of
opening larger than 2π, say S, and a function f deﬁned in S, we deﬁne the variation of f at a
point z ∈ {w ∈ S : we2πi ∈ S} by var(f )(z) = f (ze2πi) − f (z).

Under the notation adopted in this work, Theorem 8 in [35] reads as follows: Suppose ˆf is
such that φ := ˆBq ˆf is holomorphic in a neighborhood of the origin and it can be analytically
continued to a function Φ deﬁned in a sector S with bisecting direction d ∈ R, in such a way
that (13) holds for some C > 0 and µ ∈ R. Then the function f (z) := Ld
q Φ(z) is the only one
admitting ˆf as its q−Gevrey asymptotic expansion and verifying that

var f (x) =

2πi

πq Xn∈Z

(−1)nq−n(n+1)/2φ(−qnx).

So, preserving the notations in the proof of the previous result, one can aﬃrm that in the

case that

n(n−1)

Xj=1


ajzjqj−1 b(−qn+jz)
h(−qn+j)


 ≡ 0,

then f is an actual solution of the problem h(zσq)f (z) = g(z).

Example 6.6. Concerning the series (12), which appears in [35], one can put r = 1 and
a1 = (−1), so that fj = a1qj−1fj−1 for every j ≥ 1, with fj = (−1)jq
is q−Gevrey summable in all directions d but d = −π.

. One has that (12)

j(j−1)

The equation (15) is satisﬁed in this example, as expected because the function f constructed
in Theorem 6.4 turns out to be a solution of the q−diﬀerence equation zy(qz) + y(z)) = z.
Condition (15) reads as follows in this particular example: h(z) = 1 + z, b(z) = −z, and then

h(−qn+1) (cid:21) ≡ 0

1 − qn+1 ≡ 0.

The previous fact is equivalent to

which is veriﬁed due to the fact that the n−th term in the summation is canceled by the term
in position −n − 1, for every n ∈ N0.
