Abstract We have observed a metal-insulator transition of a quasi-two di-
mensional electronic system in transition metal dichalcogenide 2H-TaSe2 caused
by doping iron. The sheet resistance of 2H-FexTaSe2 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.120) single
crystals rises about 106 times with the increasing of x at the lowest tempera-
ture. We investigated the temperature dependence of the resistance and found
a metal-insulator transition with a critical sheet resistance 11.7 ± 5.4 kΩ. The
critical exponent of the localization length ν is estimated 0.31 ± 0.18. The
values of the critical sheet resistance and ν are accordant to those of the chiral
unitary class (less than h/1.49e2 = 17.3 kΩ and 0.35 ± 0.03, respectively).
We suggest that 2H-FexTaSe2 is classiﬁed as the chiral unitary class, not as
standard unitary class.

1 Introduction

The concept of disorder-induced localization of electrons was ﬁrst proposed by
P. W. Anderson [1]. An electron scattered by a disordered potential interferes
with itself and consequently localizes in space. In this situation, tempera-
ture and magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the conductance and critical exponents
near metal-insulator transitions are universal: independent of the kind of ma-
terial [2]. They depend only on the dimensions and internal symmetries of
single-particle Hamiltonians describing the systems. The internal symmetries

are time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and spin-rotational symmetry (SRS) [3,4].
For instance, quantum Hall state is a good example of an Anderson localiza-
tion state with the breaking of TRS (classiﬁed in unitary class). Furthermore,
the ﬁeld of study of Anderson localization also involves that of topological
insulators [5,6]. The classiﬁcation of topological insulators in d dimensions
is constructed by studying the localization problem in a (d − 1)-dimensional
(surface of d dimensional systems) disordered system. Identifying the univer-
sality class is regarded as an important problem of modern condensed matter
physics.

The scaling theory of Anderson localization predicts that all electrons in a
disordered potential are localized in two-dimensional (2D) systems when both
TRS and SRS of the Hamiltonians are preserved [7]. However, when a homo-
geneous magnetic ﬁeld is applied, electrons are extended, not localized due
to broken TRS. In this situation, the Hamiltonians are classiﬁed as unitary
class. It is a stimulating question whether electrons localize or not in which
TRS is locally and randomly broken by a random magnetic ﬁeld (RMF). An
RMF means that localized magnetic moments take random positions in space.
The universality class of this system is non-trivial since TRS is locally bro-
ken but globally not. It has been suggested that the quantum states in RMF
systems are relevant to the physics of strongly correlated electron systems
such as fractional quantum Hall systems [8,9] or high Tc superconductors [10].
Nevertheless, the conduction of electrons in an RMF has been studied only
by theoretical methods [11,12]. Our purpose is to clarify the conduction of
electrons in RMF systems experimentally.

In this letter, we measured the resistance of single crystals with 2D elec-
tronic systems with an RMF and considered the universality class of their
systems. We formed an RMF in 2H-TaSe2 crystals by doping magnetic impu-
rities. The paramagnetism possessed by 2H-FexTaSe2 crystals indicates that
the magnetic moments are random in space, and so the crystals are ideal RMF
systems. We observed a metal-insulator transition by increasing of x from the
result of a resistance measurement. The resistance of insulator single crystals
became almost independent of temperature below ∼ 20 K. This behavior is
consistent with the unitary class of Anderson localization. However, the esti-
mated critical sheet resistance is accordant to that of the chiral unitary class
rather than that of the unitary class. The same result is provided from the
approximation of the critical exponent of the localization length ν. We propose
that 2H-FexTaSe2 is classiﬁed in chiral unitary class.

2 Experiments

We chose 2H-TaSe2 as the base system. 2H-TaSe2 is a typical quasi 2D con-
ductor. A layer of 2H-TaSe2 is constructed from two triangular sheets of Se
atoms separated by one sheet of Ta atoms [13,14]. The in-plane conductivity
of the crystal is thousands times greater than the out-of-plane value [15]. The
temperature dependent of resistance of 2H-TaSe2 single crystals is metallic

above the super-conductive transition temperature Tc = 0.2 K. This Tc is
lower value among transition metal dichalcogenides.

We tried to realize an RMF in 2H-TaSe2 crystals by doping them with
magnetic impurities. If doped crystals exhibit paramagnetism, the crystals
have an RMF since the magnetic moments are random. We doped the crystals
with iron as magnetic impurities. Doped Fe atoms substitute the Ta atoms or
intercalate between layers. If the locations and magnetic moments of Fe atoms
have no order, 2H-FexTaSe2 crystals form an RMF system.

All the samples were grown using the chemical vapor transport method. We
reacted FeTa alloys and selenium shots. The FeTa alloys were made from iron
wires (0.2 mm in diameter, 99.5 %) and tantalum wires (1.0 mm in diameter,
99.95 %). The wires were melted in an argon atmosphere with an electronic arc
furnace. Every alloy and shot were sealed in evacuated (∼ 10−6 Torr) quartz
tubes, and reacted at about 780 ◦C for a week before being ﬁnally quenched in
water. The Fe doping rates x of the grown crystals were measured using energy
dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). We obtained higher doping rate samples
than the previous study [16] To investigate the magnetic property of the crys-
tals, we measured the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility
and the magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the magnetic moments. The suscepti-
bility and moments of the crystals were measured using a Quantum Design
superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) ﬂuxmeter MPMS-XL.
Several crystals were wrapped in kapton foil and mounted in plastic straws.
Crystalline axis of measured crystals does not correspond to the direction of
a magnetic ﬁeld.

We measured the temperature dependence of the resistances of single crys-
tals using the four-terminal method. The current was parallel to the conduction
surface of the crystal. We performed measurements from room temperature to
0.5 or 0.3 K with cryostats. Furthermore, we measured the magnetoresistance
of the crystals. The applied magnetic ﬁeld was perpendicular to the conduction
surface of the crystals.

3 Results and Discussion

We conﬁrmed that an RMF system was realized in 2H-FexTaSe2 crystals mea-
suring the magnetic susceptibility. The temperature dependence of the mag-
netic susceptibility χ for the 2H-FexTaSe2 crystals (x = 0, 0.050 and 0.120)
at 1.0 T is shown Fig. 1 (a). The susceptibility of the pure sample (x = 0)
decreased at 120 K because the charge density wave (CDW) transition re-
duced Pauli susceptibility. This is a typical behavior of 2H-TaSe2 [17]. The
susceptibility of the doped samples (x = 0.050 and 0.120) was independent
of temperature above 40 K and increased greatly below 40 K. The suscep-
tibility above 40 K indicates that Pauli paramagnetism is dominant at high
temperature.

Figure 1 (b) shows the temperature dependence of the susceptibility χ −
χ0 normalized to zero at 40 K. χ0 includes Pauli paramagnetism and the

FexTaSe2 crystals where x = 0, 0.050 and 0.120. Error bars are within the range of the
plot points. (a) shows the susceptibility χ against T and (b) shows the susceptibility χ − χ0
at 1.0 T, where χ0 includes the Pauli paramagnetism and molecular diamagnetism of the
crystals. We ﬁt the susceptibilities χ − χ0 with 1/T , and show them as solid lines. (c) shows

molecular diamagnetism of the crystals. The solid lines in Fig. 1 (b) are ﬁtting
lines χ − χ0 by 1/T . χ − χ0 is proportional to 1/T between 40 K and 4 K (or
between 0.025 K−1 and 0.25 K−1). The gradients of χ − χ0 increased as the Fe
doping rate rises. χ − χ0 indicates that Curie paramagnetism is dominant at
low temperature and that the doped iron contributes to the paramagnetism
when x = 0.050 and 0.120. Since there may be a few unexpected magnetic
impurities in the sample or the holder, the χ − χ0 of x = 0 is also proportional
to 1/T in spite of the absence of iron.

Figure 1 (c) shows the magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the magnetic moments
m − m0 at 2.0 K. m0 includes the Pauli paramagnetism and the molecular
diamagnetism of the crystals. m − m0 was linear below ±3.0 T, but decreased
above ±3.0 T because of magnetic saturation. The m − m0 gradients increased
as the Fe doping rate rises. No magnetic hysteresis was observed. On the
other hand, results of Fig. 1 (a) and (b) indicate that magnetic moments of
doped iron atoms exhibits Curie paramagnetism. Considering the results of
the susceptibility, the iron atoms in 2H-FexTaSe2 have no magnetic order, in
other words, magnetic moments of iron locate at random. We conclude that
RMF systems are formed in the crystals.

Figure 2 (a) shows the temperature dependence of sheet resistances Rsheet
for 2H-FexTaSe2 single crystals. This result has been reported recently [18].
The x = 0, 0.009, 0.050, 0.054, 0.082 and 0.120 values were measured. The
Rsheet values were calculated from the resistances of the samples, the sample
size and the lattice constant of 2H-TaSe2; c = 6.2 ˚A. The sample size measured
with an optical microscope and a ﬁeld emission-scanning electron microscope
(FE-SEM). The values of Rsheet rose drastically by increasing x. The gradients
of temperature dependence changed from positive to negative between x =
0.050 and 0.054. This indicates that metal-insulator transition is induced by
doping iron. For metal samples (x = 0, 0.009 and 0.050), inﬂection points
which indicate the CDW transition were observed at 118 K, 70 K and 64.3 K,

respectively. This is typical behavior of 2H-TaSe2 [19]. There was no anomaly
such as the Kondo eﬀect in the metal samples. In contrast, the Rsheet of x =
0.054, 0.082 and 0.120 increased with cooling. This temperature dependence
is consistent with an insulator. However, the values of insulator Rsheet were
almost constant at low temperature as if they were metal. We suggest that
this behavior represents weak localization with magnetic scattering classiﬁed
in unitary class [20].

We measured the Hall coeﬃcients RH to investigate eﬀect of doped iron on
carrier density. Figure 2 (b) shows the correlation between estimated values of
|RH| and Rsheet. All values of the RH are negative. A blue rectangle indicates
a boundary between metal and insulator phase, corresponding to minimum
Rsheet of x = 0.050 and maximum Rsheet of x = 0.054. The values of the
|RH| are same order over the metal-insulator transition (inside of a green
rectangle in Fig. 2 (b)), except for the largest Rsheet . This indicates that

Six classes of single-particle Hamiltonians are classiﬁed in terms of the presence or absence of
time-reversal symmetry (TRS), spin-rotational symmetry (SRS) and chiral symmetry (ChS).
The critical values of the orthogonal class do not exist because all the electrons localize [7].
The critical resistance of the unitary class is at the zero-temperature transition between
quantum Hall liquids or between a quantum Hall liquid and an insulator [22]. (∗Critical
resistances of the chiral orthogonal class and the chiral unitary class are not critical values
of the phase transition, but the conductance of the Dirac fermion. In the chiral unitary class,
the critical resistance depends on the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld. The critical resistance
is maximum; h/1.49e2 = 17.3 kΩ for the strongest ﬁeld [27].)

change of carrier density does not induce metal-insulator transition in 2H-
FexTaSe2 crystals. From the results of Fig. 2 (a) and (b), it is considered that
doped iron brings decline of mobility of electrons rather than carrier doping.
Therefore, we propose that the disorder (random magnetic potential) formed
by doped iron induces Anderson localization and the metal-insulator transition
in the crystals.

The temperature dependence of the insulator samples was consistent with
that of unitary class, however, the critical sheet resistance (CSR) of this metal-
insulator transition was not. We discuss the universality class of 2H-FexTaSe2
based on predicted critical resistances and critical exponents in 2D systems
(Table 1). To estimate the CSR, we focused on the gradients α of the temper-
ature dependence after the CDW transition. α is given by

α =

d log Rsheet

d log T

.

Figure 2 (c) shows the correlation between the Rsheet and the α calculated from
Fig. 2 (a). We obtained Rsheet and α values between 100 and 20 K, below the
TCDW and above the temperature which Rsheet becomes independent of T .
When the α equals zero, the Rsheet is independent of temperature, hence it is
the critical value. We estimated that the CSR is 11.7±5.4 kΩ. From Table 1, the
CSR of the unitary class is 2h/e2 = 51.6 kΩ, namely larger than the estimated
value. Furthermore, we estimated a critical exponent of the localization length
ν. The ν is expressed in β function given by

except for the constant terms [28,29]. We calculated the value of ν using
ν = (gcβ ′(gc))−1, where gc is the critical g of the metal-insulator transition,
and obtained it as 0.31 ± 0.18. From Table 1, this is also inconsistent with that
of unitary class (2.616 ± 0.014). The estimated values both of the CSR and
the ν correspond to them of chiral unitary class (less than h/1.49e2 = 17.3 kΩ
and 0.35 ± 0.03, respectively) rather than standard unitary class.

We suggest that symmetric property of an RMF diﬀers from that of unitary
class, namely random scalar potential with a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld. To
provide an intuitive understanding, we propose a model focused on the spacial
variation of phase of electrons. This model is created based on a work by
J. Miller and J. Wang [30]. Figure 3 shows schematics of (a) random scalar
potentials with a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld, (b) an RMF, and correlation
between the phase and the location of an electron x. When electrons move in
the magnetic ﬁeld, the ﬁeld adds phase φm to wave functions of electrons. The
φm value is given by φm = −ı¯h−1 R eA(r) · dr, r is the electron location and
A(r) is the vector potential. We regard the spatial variation of the phase as
the ﬂuid of the phase.

ting lines obtained with R(B)/Rmin ∝ log B.. (b) shows the magnetoresistance R(B)/Rmin
plotted by B1/2. The lines are ﬁtting lines obtained with R(B)/Rmin ∝ B1/2.

In Fig. 3 (a), when an electron moves in the positive direction, φm turns
counter-clockwise on a complex plane as blue arrows on circles. The chirality
for a direction never changes for a long distance. That is to say, the helicity
of phase is ﬁnite in Fig. 3 (a). In this case, the symmetry of chirality of the
phase is broken because the chirality is distinguishable. On the other hand,
in Fig. 3 (b), when an electron moves in the positive direction, the φm turns
clockwise ﬁrst as red arrows on circles, and then switches to counter-clockwise
as the blue arrows. If the direction of the magnet ﬂuxes are random, this
switching must exist. This means that the helicity of the phase is zero for a
long distance in Fig. 3 (b). In this case, the clockwise chirality and the counter-
clockwise chirality cannot be identiﬁed from each other, namely symmetry of
the chirality is valid. Our model implies that the RMF is diﬀerent essentially
from random scalar potential with a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld. The TRS
is absent from both of them, but the symmetric property of the chirality is
diﬀerent from each other. Essence of Anderson localization is interference of
wave functions, hence we suggest that the diﬀerence of the symmetry aﬀects
the localization and the conduction of electron.

We observed that the magnetoresistance of the insulator 2H-FexTaSe2 is
inconsistent with the theory of weak localization. Figure 4 (a) shows the mag-
netic ﬁeld dependence of magnetoresistance R(B)/Rmin for x = 0.054 and
0.120 versus log B. The applied magnetic ﬁeld was perpendicular to the con-
duction surface of the crystals. The lines are ﬁtting lines obtained by using
R(B)/Rmin ∝ log B. Positive magnetoresistance is observed in both of insu-
lator samples. This is a distinctive feature of symplectic class in the weak
localization, not unitary class. Although the R(B)/Rmin values were not pro-
portional to log B, which is expected in 2D symplectic class [4].

On the other hand, we found that the magnetoresistance of 2H-FexTaSe2
can be ﬁtted by B1/2 rather than log B. Figure 4 (b) shows the magnetic
ﬁeld dependence of magnetoresistance R(B)/Rmin for x = 0.054 and 0.120.
Both R(B)/Rmin were proportional to B1/2 above 1.5 T1/2. This behavior is
similar to the magnetoresistance of dirty graphite [31]. Y. Koike et al. observed
that the resistivity of dirty graphite was also proportional to B1/2 in a strong
magnetic ﬁeld. They explained this behavior with the weak localization and a
Coulomb interaction between electrons, but the explanation was quantitatively
insuﬃcient.

4 Summary

In this paper, we reported the resistance measurement of iron-doped 2H-
TaSe2. We conﬁrmed that 2H-FexTaSe2 crystals exhibit paramagnetism by
measuring the magnetic susceptibility and moments. Based on the results,
we propose that 2H-FexTaSe2 oﬀers a good way to investigate a 2D elec-
tronic system with an RMF. We measured the temperature dependence of
the resistances of crystals and discovered a metal-insulator transition caused
by increasing x. This temperature dependence is inconsistent with the Kondo
eﬀect and the weak localization of the orthogonal class, but consistent with
the localization of the unitary class. However, the observed critical sheet re-
sistance and critical exponent ν are 11.7 ± 5.4 kΩ and 0.31 ± 0.18, which are
accordant to them of chiral unitary class (less than h/1.49e2 = 17.3 kΩ and
0.35 ± 0.03, respectively) rather than standard unitary class. We conclude that
2H-FexTaSe2 should be classiﬁed in the chiral unitary class. This paper is the
ﬁrst experimental report of an RMF system and the chiral unitary class.
