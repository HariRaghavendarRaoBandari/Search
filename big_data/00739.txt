ABSTRACT. Let k be a ﬁeld of characteristic not equal to 2, 3, O an octonion over k
and J the exceptional Jordan algebra deﬁned by O. We consider the prehomoge-
neous vector space (G, V) where G = GE6 × GL(2) and V = J ⊕ J . We prove that
generic rational orbits of this prehomogeneous vector space are in bijective corre-
spondence with k-isomorphism classes of pairs (M, n) where M’s are isotopes of
J and n’s are cubic ´etale subalgebras of M. Also we prove that if O is split, then
generic rational orbits are in bijective correspondence with isomorphism classes of
separable extensions of k of degrees up to 3.

1. INTRODUCTION

Part of the results in this paper is taken from the ﬁrst author’s master thesis.
Let k be a ﬁeld of characteristic not equal to 2, 3, k× = k \ {0}, ksep the separable
closure of k and k the algebraic closure of k. We use the notation ch(k) for the
characteristic of k. If X is a ﬁnite set, then let |X| denote its cardinality. We denote
the algebra of n × n matrices by M(n) and the group of n × n invertible matrices by
GL(n). Let SL(n) = {g ∈ GL(n) | det(g) = 1}. If V is a ﬁnite dimensional vector
space over k, then GL(V) is the group of invertible k-linear maps from V to V itself.
For g ∈ GL(V), det(g) is well-deﬁned. Let SL(V) = {g ∈ GL(V) | det(g) = 1}.
We denote the Lie algebras of GL(n), GL(V) by gl(n), gl(V) respectively.

the Cayley–Dickson process (see [4, pp.101–110]). If A = M(2) and the norm is the

Let eO be the split octonion over k. It is the normed algebra over k obtained by
determinant, then eO is A(+) with the notation of [4]. An octonion is, by deﬁnition,
a normed algebra which is a k-form ofeO. Let O be an octonion. We use the notation

kxk for the norm of x ∈ O. If a ∈ k, kaxk = a2kxk. For x, y ∈ O, let

Q(x, y) = 1

2 (kx + yk − kxk − kyk).

This is a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form such that Q(x, x) = kxk. Note
that 2Q(x, y) is denoted by hx, yi in [12, p.1]. Let W ⊂ O be the orthogonal com-
plement of k · 1 with respect to Q. If x = x1 + x2 where x1 ∈ k · 1, x2 ∈ W, then we

and call it the conjugate of x. Note that kxk = xx. The map O ∋ x 7→ ι(x) ∈ O is an
element of GL(O) where O is regarded as a k-vector space. For x ∈ O, we deﬁne
the trace tr(x) by tr(x) = x + x. Note that

tr(xy) = tr(yx) = 2Q(x, y), tr(xy) = tr(yx).

Also the following properties:

(1.2)

tr((xy)z) = tr(x(yz))

are satisﬁed for all x, y, z ∈ O (see [12, p.8, Lemma 1.3.2]). Therefore, we may write
tr(xyz) instead of tr((xy)z) or tr(x(yz)).

Let J be the exceptional Jordan algebra over k. Any element X ∈ J is of the

form:

(1.3)

X =

s1 x3 x2
s2 x1
x3
x2 x1
s3

 , si ∈ k, xi ∈ O (i = 1, 2, 3).

We sometimes denote this element by h(s1, s2, s3, x1, x2, x3). For elements of J , the
notion of the determinant is well-deﬁned and is given by

(1.4)

det(X) = s1s2s3 + tr(x1x2x3) − s1kx1k − s2kx2k − s3kx3k.

The multiplication of J is deﬁned as follows:

X ◦ Y =

1
2

(XY + YX),

where the multiplication used on the right-hand side is the multiplication of ma-
trices.

Let Sn be the symmetric group of {1, · · · , n}. We deﬁne the multiplication of

σ, τ ∈ Sn by
(1.5)

(στ)(i) = τ(σ(i))

for i ∈ {1, · · · , n}. Let (i j) denote the transposition of i 6= j ∈ {1, · · · , n}.

The algebraic groups SO(Q), E6 and GE6 are given by

SO(Q) = {α ∈ SL(O) | ∀x, y ∈ O, Q(α(x), α(y)) = Q(x, y)},

E6 = {L ∈ GL(J ) | ∀X ∈ J , det(LX) = det(X)},

GE6 = {L ∈ GL(J ) | ∀X ∈ J , det(LX) = c(L) det(X) for some c(L) ∈ GL(1)}
respectively. Then c : GE6 → GL(1) is a character and there exists an exact se-
quence

(1.6)

0 → E6 ֒→ GE6

c→ GL(1) → 0.

It is known that E6 is a smooth connected quasi-simple simply-connected alge-
braic group of type E6 (see [12, p.181, Theorem 7.3.2]). The terminology “quasi-
simple” means that its inner automorphism group is simple (see [11, p.136]). Since
the dimension of E6 as a variety and the dimension of the Lie algebra of E6 coincide
(see the proof of [12, p.181, Theorem 7.3.2]), the smoothness of the group follows.

Let H1 = E6, G1 = GE6 and H = H1 × GL(2) respectively. Let

(1.7)

G = G1 × GL(2), V = J ⊗ Aff2

RATIONAL ORBITS OF THE SPACE OF PAIRS OF EXCEPTIONAL JORDAN ALGEBRAS

where Aff2 is the 2-dimensional afﬁne space regarded as a vector space. Then V is
a representation of G.

We deﬁne a character c′ of G by the composition of homomorphisms

(1.8)

G = G1 × GL(2)

pr1−→ G1

c→ GL(1)

where “pr1” is the natural projection. The representation J of G1 is irreducible (see
the proof of [12, p.181, Theorem 7.3.2]) and so V is an irreducible representation of
G. The pair (G, V) is what we call a prehomogeneous vector space.

We review the deﬁnition of prehomogeneous vector spaces. In the following

deﬁnition, k is an arbitrary ﬁeld and G, V are not necessarily the above G, V.

Deﬁnition 1.9. Let G be a connected reductive group, V a representation and χ a
non-trivial primitive character of G, all deﬁned over k. Then, (G, V, χ) is called a
prehomogeneous vector space if it satisﬁes the following properties.

(i) There exists a Zariski open orbit.
(ii) There exists a non-constant polynomial ∆(x) ∈ k[V] such that ∆(gx) =

χ(g)a∆(x) for a positive integer a.

The polynomial ∆ is called a relative invariant polynomial.

If (G, V, χ) is an irreducible (as a representation) prehomogeneous vector space,
then the choices of χ, ∆ are essentially unique and we may write (G, V) instead of
(G, V, χ). We deﬁne Vss
k = {x ∈ Vk | ∆(x) 6= 0} and call it the set of semi-stable
points.

Now we assume that ch(k) 6= 2, 3 and that G, V are as in (1.7) again. We shall

show the existence of an open orbit in Proposition 3.2(2).

We identify Aff2 as the space of linear forms in two variables v = (v1, v2) and
regard elements of V as the set of x = x1v1 + x2v2 where x1, x2 ∈ J . The action of
g = (g1, g2) ∈ G where g2 = ( a b

c d(cid:1) on V is given by

(1.10)

g(x1v1 + x2v2) = g1(x1)(av1 + cv2) + g1(x2)(bv1 + dv2).

For x ∈ V, let

(1.11)

Fx(v) = Fx(v1, v2) = det(x1v1 + x2v2).

This is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3 of v = (v1, v2). We deﬁne an action
of G on Sym3Aff2 by

(1.12)

G × Sym3Aff2 ∋ ((g1, g2), f (v)) 7→ c(g1) f (vg2) ∈ Sym3Aff2,

where we are regarding v as a row vector. Then the map V ∋ x 7→ Fx ∈ Sym3Aff2
is G-equivariant.

For f ∈ Sym3Aff2, we denote the discriminant of f by ∆( f ). It is easy to see that

∆(Fx) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 12 in k[V], and that

∆(Fgx) = c(g1)4(det(g2))6∆(Fx).

So (G, V) is an irreducible prehomogeneous vector space and ∆(Fx) is a relative
invariant polynomial of degree 12 of x. We shall discuss the details in Section 3.

Let Gw denote the stabilizer of w in G and Hw = Gw ∩ H.

Suppose that (G, V) is an arbitrary irreducible prehomogeneous vector space
over k. If there exists w ∈ Vss
k such that Gw is reductive (we are assuming that
reductive groups are smooth over the ground ﬁeld), then (G, V) is said to be regu-
lar. If (G, V) is irreducible and regular, it is known that Vss
ksep is a single Gksep-orbit
(see [15]). Note that it is proved in [15] that Vksep \ Gksepw is a hypersurface. How-
ever, since the representation is irreducible, the k-algebra generated by relative
invariant polynomials has a single generator, say ∆(x). Then Vksep \ Gksepw must
coincide with {x ∈ Vksep | ∆(x) = 0}. Therefore, {x ∈ Vksep | ∆(x) 6= 0} = Gksepw
and so Vss

ksep is a single Gksep-orbit.

This implies that for any x ∈ Vss

ksep, there exists g ∈ Gksep such that x = gw. We

deﬁne a map cx by

(1.14)

cx : Gal(ksep/k) ∋ σ 7→ g−1gσ ∈ Gw ksep.

Then cx is a 1-cocycle and deﬁnes an element of the ﬁrst Galois cohomology set
H1(k, Gw). For the deﬁnition of the Galois action and the Galois cohomology
set, see Section 2. For arbitrary algebraic groups G, H deﬁned over k, a homo-
: H1(k, G) → H1(k, H)
morphism f
which is induced by f , we denote the inverse image of 1 ∈ H1(k, H) under h1
f by

: G → H deﬁned over k and a map h1
f

Ker(cid:0)H1(k, G) → H1(k, H)(cid:1). The following theorem is well-known (see [5, pp.268,269]

for example).

Theorem 1.15. If (G, V) is an irreducible prehomogeneous vector space, the orbit of w ∈
V is open in V and Gw is reductive, then the map

(1.16)

is well-deﬁned and bijective.

Gk\Vss

k ∋ x 7→ cx ∈ Ker(cid:16)H1(k, Gw) → H1(k, G)(cid:17)

Note that it is assumed in [5] that ch(k) = 0. The proof of the above theorem
ksep is a single Gksep-orbit. As we pointed out above, with the
ksep is a single Gksep-orbit even if the characteristic of

works as long as Vss
assumption of the theorem, Vss
k is positive. So the above theorem holds in all characteristics.

Now we go back to our situation and assume that G = G1 × GL(2), V = J ⊗
Aff2. When k is the ﬁeld of complex numbers, Sato and Kimura have shown in
[10, pp.138,139] that (G, V) is a prehomogeneous vector space having a relative
invariant polynomial of degree 12 and for a generic point w ∈ V, the Lie algebra of
Gw is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of SO(Q). However, the structure of Gw has not
been determined completely over an arbitrary ground ﬁeld and the interpretation
of Gk\Vss
k

is unknown.

In Section 3, we determine the structure of the stabilizer as an algebraic group

over k and obtain the following proposition.

RATIONAL ORBITS OF THE SPACE OF PAIRS OF EXCEPTIONAL JORDAN ALGEBRAS

Proposition 1.17. Gw is isomorphic to GL(1) × (Spin(Q) ⋊ S3). In particular, Gw is a
smooth reductive algebraic group.

Let JIC(k) be the set of equivalence classes of pairs (M, n) where M’s are iso-
topes of J and n’s are cubic ´etale subalgebras of M (see Section 4 or [12, pp.154–
158] for the deﬁnition of isotopes of J ). For the details of the equivalence relation,
see Section 4. In Section 4, we associate a pair (M, n) ∈ JIC(k) to each point in Vss
k .
Our main theorem concerns a correspondence between the set Gk\Vss
k of rational
orbits and the set of equivalence classes of pairs (M, n) as above. The following
theorem is our main theorem.

Theorem 1.18. The set Gk\Vss

k corresponds bijectively with the set JIC(k).

In Section 5, to each element of Vss

k , we associate an isotope of J and its cubic
´etale subalgebra explicitly by constructing an equivariant map from J ⊗ Aff2 to
J .

If α ∈ k and Fx(α, 1) = 0, we call α a root of Fx(v). In Section 6, we prove the

following theorem.

Theorem 1.19. If k is a ﬁnite ﬁeld or O is the split octonion, then there is a bijective corre-
spondence between Gk\Vss
k , then the corresponding
cohomology class in H1(k, S3) is the element determined by the action of the Galois group
on the set of roots of Fx(v).

k and H1(k, S3). Moreover, if x ∈ Vss

If n > 0, then it is well-known that Sn is the automorphism group of the k-
algebra kn. Therefore, the set H1(k, Sn) can be identiﬁed with k-isomorphism
classes of ´etale k-algebras of degree n. In the situation of Theorem 1.19, consid-
ering the case n = 3, rational orbits in Vss
k are in bijective correspondence with
separable extensions of k of degrees up to 3. Also if x ∈ Vss
k corresponds to a sepa-
rable cubic extension, then the identity component G◦
w is isomorphic to a k-form of
Spin(Q) which comes from the triality and so Gk\Vss
k parametrizes such objects.

The problem of ﬁnding arithmetic interpretations of rational orbits of prehomo-
geneous vector spaces is classical and goes back to the work of Gauss. Some cases
which are in some sense similar to our case have been considered. For example,
the prehomogeneous vector spaces considered in [14], [6], [13] have close relations
with ﬁeld extensions of the ground ﬁeld of degrees up to 5. Among the cases con-
sidered in these papers, consider the following prehomogenous vector spaces:

(a) G = GL(3) × GL(2), V = Sym2Aff3 ⊗ Aff2 (see [14]),
(b) G = Resk1/k GL(3) × GL(2), V = H3(k1) ⊗ Aff2 (see [6]),
(c) G = GL3(D) × GL(2), V = H3(D) ⊗ Aff2 (see [13])

where k1 is a quadratic extension of k, D is a quaternion algebra over k and H3(k1), H3(D)
are the spaces of 3 × 3 Hermitian matrices with entries in k1, D respectively. These
cases have the same set of weights with respect to their maximal split tori. If the
ground ﬁeld is R, these cases and our case correspond to R, C, H (the Hamilton-
ian), O. So our case is the last of these series.

The problem of ﬁnding arithmetic interpretations of rational orbits of our case

over rings is more difﬁcult. We may consider such problems in the future.

In Section 2, we deﬁne and review basic notions such as the Galois cohomology,
the Lie algebra of groups of type E6 and the triality concerning Spin(8). In Sec-
tion 3, we determine the structure of the stabilizer Gw. In Section 4, we give an
intrinsic arithmetic interpretation of the set of rational orbits Gk\Vss
k . In Section
5, we construct the isotopes corresponding to points in Vss
k explicitly by using an
equivariant map from V to J . In Section 6, we prove Theorem 1.19.

2. PRELIMINARIES

In this section, we deﬁne basic notations and prove fundamental facts used in

the subsequent sections.

We deﬁne an action of the Galois group on an algebraic group as follows. Sup-
pose that K is a Galois extension of k. Then we deﬁne the multiplication in the
Galois group Gal(K/k) by

(2.1)

(στ)(a) = τ (σ(a)) .

for σ, τ ∈ Gal(K/k) and a ∈ K. We denote the action of σ ∈ Gal(K/k) on x ∈ K by
xσ. This is a right action.

Let G be an arbitrary algebraic group over k. The Lie algebra of G is denoted by
Lie(G). We denote the identity component (the connected component containing
the unit element) by G◦. If G acts on a variety X and x ∈ X, then we denote the
stabilizer and the orbit of x by Gx, G(x) respectively.

If F is any extension ﬁeld of k, then G can be regarded as an algebraic group
over F. If R is a k-algebra, we denote the set of R-rational points by GR. If K/k is
a ﬁeld extension, then we denote the K-algebra of regular functions in the sense
of [2, p.15, 6.3] on GK by K[G]. Then, ksep[G] ∼= ksep ⊗k k[G]. We deﬁne a right
action of Gal(ksep/k) on ksep[G] by

ν(σ) : ksep ⊗k k[G] ∋ ∑ ai ⊗ vi 7→ ∑ aσ

i ⊗ vi ∈ ksep ⊗k k[G].

For any p ∈ Gksep, let p# be the associated ksep-algebra homomorphism from
ksep[G] to ksep. Then σ ◦ p# ◦ ν(σ)−1 is also a ksep-algebra homomorphism. We de-
note the element in Gksep corresponding to σ ◦ p# ◦ ν(σ)−1 by pσ. Then, pστ = (pσ)τ
for any σ, τ ∈ Gal(ksep/k). Therefore, we can deﬁne a right action of Gal(ksep/k)
on Gksep by

Gksep × Gal(ksep/k) ∋ (p, σ) 7→ pσ ∈ Gksep.
We next deﬁne notations regarding the Galois cohomology.

Deﬁnition 2.2. For an algebraic group G over k, we consider the discrete topol-
ogy on Gksep. A continuous function h : Gal(ksep/k) → Gksep is called a 1-cocycle if
h(στ) = h(τ)h(σ)τ for any σ, τ ∈ Gal(ksep/k). Two 1-cocycles h and h′ are equiva-
lent if there exists g ∈ Gksep such that

h(σ) = g−1h′(σ)gσ

for any σ ∈ Gal(ksep/k). The ﬁrst Galois cohomology set H1(k, G) is the set of equiv-
alent classes of 1-cocycles by the above equivalence relation.

We shall deﬁne several notions regarding the exceptional Jordan algebra J (see
(1.3)) and review its fundamental properties. For the rest of this paper G, G1, H, H1
are the groups deﬁned in Introduction.

Let In be the n × n unit matrix. We denote the diagonal matrix with diagonal

entries α1, . . . , αn by diag(α1, . . . , αn).

Let O be an octonion and J the exceptional Jordan algebra as in Introduction.
Let O× = {x ∈ O | kxk 6= 0}. This set is closed under multiplication, but may not
be a group since the multiplication is not associative. However, if x ∈ O×, then
x−1 exists in O. If X, Y ∈ J , then we denote the usual matrix multiplication by
XY. If X, Y, Z ∈ J and (XY)Z = X(YZ), we may write XYZ.
For X ∈ J , we deﬁne an endomorphism RX ∈ End(J ) by

RX(W) = W ◦ X =

1
2

(WX + XW)

for W ∈ J . We deﬁne a symmetric trilinear form D on J by

6D(X, Y, Z) = det(X + Y + Z) − det(X + Y) − det(Y + Z) − det(Z + X)

+ det(X) + det(Y) + det(Z).

We denote the trace (the sum of diagonal entries) on J by Tr. For X, Y ∈ J , we
deﬁne a symmetric bilinear form h , i on J by

hX, Yi = Tr(X ◦ Y).

One can verify by direct computation that the symmetric bilinear form h , i satisﬁes
the following equation:

hX ◦ Y, Zi = hX, Y ◦ Zi,

∀X, Y, Z ∈ J .

For X, Y ∈ J , X × Y is, by deﬁnition, the element satisfying the following equa-

tion:

hX × Y, Zi = 3D(X, Y, Z),

∀Z ∈ J .

Let e = I3. Then the following equations are satisﬁed (see [12, p.122, Lemma 5.2.1]).

We deﬁne an injective k-linear map ιi : O → J for i = 1, 2, 3 by

(2.6)

ιi(x) = (x)i,

∀x ∈ O.

We denote ιi(O) ⊂ J by Oi.

The algebraic group F4 is deﬁned as follows:

(2.7)

F4 = Aut(J ) = {L ∈ G1 | L(X) ◦ L(Y) = L(X ◦ Y),

∀X, Y ∈ J }.

It is known that

(2.8)

F4 = {L ∈ G1 | L(e) = e}

(see [12, p.159, Proposition 5.9.4]) and F4 is a connected simple algebraic group of
type F4 which is deﬁned over k (see [12, p.178, Theorem 7.2.1]). Note that if g ∈ G1
and g(e) = e, then by taking the determinant, c(g) = 1 and so g ∈ H1.

Let h1 and f be the Lie algebras of H1 and F4 respectively. Let k[ε]/(ε2 ) be the

ring of dual numbers. Since ch(k) 6= 3, it is easy to see that

h1 = {t ∈ gl(J ) | det ((1 + εt)(X)) = det(X),

∀X ∈ J }

(2.9)

= {t ∈ gl(J ) | D(t(X), X, X) = 0,

∀X ∈ J },

f = {t ∈ h1 | (1 + εt)(e) = e} = {t ∈ h1 | t(e) = 0}.

Moreover, it is known that dim h1 = 78 and dim f = 52 (see [12, p.181, Theorem
7.3.2] and [12, p.180,Corollary 7.2.2]).

Let Derk(J , J ) be the Lie algebra of k-derivations of J . The following fact is

known (see [12, p.180, Corollary 7.2.2]).

Lemma 2.10. f = Derk(J , J ) and dimkDerk(J , J ) = 52.

We deﬁne a vector subspace D0 ⊂ h1 by

D0 = {X ∈ Derk(J , J ) | X(Ei) = 0, i = 1, 2, 3}.

Let so(Q) denote the Lie algebra of SO(Q). Then

so(Q) = {t ∈ gl(O) | Q(t(x), y) + Q(x, t(y)) = 0,

∀x, y ∈ O}.

If L : O → O is a k-linear map, then we deﬁnebL = ι L ι (see (1.1)). Obviously, if
L ∈ SO(Q), so(Q), thenbL ∈ SO(Q), so(Q) respectively.

The following proposition is probably known (if k = C, it is proved in [10, pp.24–
27]). However, we could not ﬁnd a good reference over arbitrary ﬁelds of charac-
teristic not equal to 2, 3 and so we include the proof.

Proposition 2.11.

(1) h1 = Derk(J , J ) ⊕ {RY | Tr(Y) = 0}.

(2) Derk(J , J ) ∼= D0 ⊕ O ⊕ O ⊕ O.

Proof. We shall prove this proposition in the following order.

∼= so(Q).

(I) The proof of D0
(II) The proof of (2).
(III) The proof of (1).
(I) We use the following theorem (see [12, p.53, Theorem 3.5.5] and [12, p.56,

Lemma 3.5.9]).

Theorem 2.12. If ch(k) 6= 2, then for any t1 ∈ so(Q), there exist unique t2, t3 ∈ so(Q)
such that

(2.13)

t1(xy) = t2(x)y + xt3(y)

for any x, y ∈ O. If (t1, t2, t3) satisﬁes the equation (2.13), then (t2, t1,bt3) and (t3,bt2, t1)

also satisfy the equation (2.13).

It follows immediately that D(O1) ⊂ O1. Similarly, we have D(Oi) ⊂ Oi for
i = 2, 3. For α ∈ O, we deﬁne D1(α) to be the element of O such that D((α)1) =
(D1(α))1. We deﬁne D2, D3 similarly.

Since (α)2

1 = kαk(E2 + E3) and

D(cid:16)(α)2
D(cid:16)(α)2

1(cid:17) = kαkD(E2 + E3) = 0,
1(cid:17) = 2(D1 (α))1 ◦ (α)1 = 2Q(D1(α), α)(E2 + E3),

we have Q(D1(α), α) = 0. It follows that D1 ∈ so(Q). Similarly, we have D2, D3 ∈
so(Q). We deﬁne a k-linear map r by

We prove that r is bijective.

Suppose that t1 ∈ so(Q). We show that t1 is in the image of r. There exist unique

t2, t3 satisfying (2.13) by Theorem 2.12. We deﬁne a linear map Dt1 : J → J by

J by considering D((X + Y) ◦ (X + Y)). Thus, Dt1 ∈ D0 and so r(Dt1) = t1.
Therefore, r is surjective.

Suppose that D ∈ D0. Since(cid:0) αβ(cid:1)3 = 2(α)1 ◦ (β)2, we have
D(cid:0)(cid:0) αβ(cid:1)3(cid:1) = 2D((α)1 ◦ (β)2) = 2 ((D1(α))1 ◦ (β)2 + (α)1 ◦ (D2(β))2)

= (cid:16) D1(α)β + αD2(β)(cid:17)3

for any α, β ∈ O. So bD3(αβ) = D1(α)β + αD2(β). Therefore, (bD3, D1, D2) satisﬁes

the equation (2.13). So the uniqueness property of Theorem 2.12 implies that r is
injective. Therefore, we have D0

∼= so(Q) and dim D0 = 28.

For D ∈ Derk(J , J ), let Xi = D(Ei) = h(si1, si2, si3, xi1, xi2, xi3) ∈ J where

i = 1, 2, 3 (see (1.3)). Then,

D(Ei) = D(E2

from (i, j) = (1, 2),
from (i, j) = (1, 3),
from (i, j) = (2, 3).

Let

Then D0 ∈ D0 and

l((D0, 4x31, 4x12, 4x23)) = D.

Therefore, l is surjective. So we conclude that Derk(J , J ) ∼= D0 ⊕ O ⊕ O ⊕ O.

(III) Finally, we prove (1). For any RY where Tr(Y) = hY, ei = 0,

D(RY(X), X, X) =

for any X ∈ J . Thus, RY ∈ h1.

For t ∈ h1, let Y = t(e). Then, since D(t(e), e, e) = 0, by (2.3), we have

D(t(e), e, e) =

1
3

ht(e), e × ei =

hY, ei = 0,

It follows that Tr(Y) = 0. Since (t − RY)(e) = 0, by (2.9) , t − RY ∈ Derk(J , J ).
Thus,

h1 = Derk(J , J ) + {RY | Tr(Y) = 0}.

Since dim h1 = 78 = dim Derk(J , J ) + dim{RY | Tr(Y) = 0}, the above sum is a
direct sum. This completes the proof of (1).
(cid:3)

We deﬁne varieties M and RT(O) by

M = {(A, B, C) ∈ SO(Q) × SO(Q) × SO(Q) | A(x)B(y) = bC(xy), ∀x, y ∈ O},

RT(O) = {(A, B, C) ∈ SO(Q) × SO(Q) × SO(Q) | A(xy) = B(x)C(y), ∀ x, y ∈ O}

respectively. Then M and RT(O) are deﬁned over k.

The variety RT(O) is given in [12, p.59].

It is known that RT(O) is a closed
subgroup of the algebraic group SO(Q) × SO(Q) × SO(Q) (see [12, p.59]). We
show that M is also a subgroup of SO(Q) × SO(Q) × SO(Q) and is isomorphic to
RT(O) over k.

RATIONAL ORBITS OF THE SPACE OF PAIRS OF EXCEPTIONAL JORDAN ALGEBRAS

13

For any (A, B, C), (A′, B′, C′) ∈ M and x, y ∈ O, we have

(A′ A)(x)(B′ B)(y) = A′(A(x))B′(B(y)) = bC′(A(x)B(y))
= (bC′bC)(xy) = (dC′C)(xy),
(A−1)(x)(B−1)(y) = (bC−1bC)(A−1(x)B−1(y))
= bC−1(A(A−1(x))(B(B−1(y))))
= bC−1(xy) = dC−1(xy).

It follows that M is closed under multiplication and taking the inverse. Obviously,
the unit element (I8, I8, I8) of SO(Q) × SO(Q) × SO(Q) belongs to M. Therefore,
M is a subgroup of SO(Q) × SO(Q) × SO(Q).

We deﬁne a homomorphism f by

Then, f is obviously an isomorphism deﬁned over k. So M is isomorphic to RT(O)
over k. Since RT(O) is smooth over k (see [12, p.60]), M is also smooth over k.

f : M ∋ (A, B, C) 7→ (bC, A, B) ∈ RT(O).

It is known that the algebraic group RT(O) satisﬁes the following properties.

Note that we are assuming that ch(k) 6= 2.

Proposition 2.18.

(i) Let pri : RT(O) → SO(Q) be the projection pri((t1, t2, t3)) = ti (i = 1, 2, 3).
Then pr1 is a surjective homomorphism from RT(O) to SO(Q) with kernel of
order 2 and the representations pri on O are irreducible and pairwise inequivalent.

.

i = 1 (i = 1, 2, 3) and {η1, η2, η3} generates a group ˜S of outer automor-

Then η2

(iii) RT(O) is isomorphic to Spin(Q) as algebraic groups.

Proof. See [12, p.59, Proposition 3.6.1], [12, p.60, Proposition 3.6.3] and [12, p.64,
Proposition 3.6.6,].
(cid:3)

For the deﬁnition of the algebraic group Spin(Q), see [12, pp.38,39]. It is known
that Spin(Q) is connected (see [12, p.40]). Moreover, there exists a surjective ho-
momorphism from Spin(Q) to SO(Q) with kernel of order 2 if ch(k) 6= 2 (see [12,
p.40]). Since SO(Q) is semi-simple, by [2, p.192, 14.11 Corollary], Spin(Q) is semi-
simple. So RT(O) is also connected and semi-simple.

Since M is isomorphic to RT(O), we have the following proposition (we are still

assuming that ch(k) 6= 2).

Proposition 2.19.

(i) Let pri : M → SO(Q) be the projection pri((t1, t2, t3)) = ti (i = 1, 2, 3). Then
pr3 is a surjective homomorphism from M to SO(Q) with kernel of order 2 and
the representations pri on O are irreducible and pairwise inequivalent.

3. STABILIZER

In this section, we shall determine the structure of the stabilizer Gw as an alge-

braic group.

Theorem 3.1. Gw is isomorphic to GL(1) × (Spin(Q) ⋊ S3). In particular, Gw is a
smooth reductive algebraic group.
Proof. To prove this proposition, we ﬁrst determine the identity component G◦
w of
the stabilizer mainly by Lie algebra computations. Next, given an arbitrary ele-
ment g ∈ Gw, we replace g by the action of Spin(Q) ⋊ S3 so that it commutes with
all elements of Spin(Q). Then Schur’s lemma enables us to simplify the situation
enough to prove the proposition.

We ﬁrst prove the following proposition.

Proposition 3.2.

(1) G◦

w is isomorphic to GL(1) × Spin(Q) over k.

(2) (G, V) is an irreducible prehomogeneous vector space.

Proof. We shall prove this proposition in the following two steps.

(I) We show that dim Gw = 29 and Gw is smooth. In this process, we prove (2).
(II) We construct an injective homomorphism ξ : GL(1) × Spin(Q) → Gw which
is deﬁned over k and induces an isomorphism between Lie(GL(1) × Spin(Q)) and
Lie(Gw).

If (I) and (II) are proved, since the dimensions of both GL(1) × Spin(Q) and Gw
are equal to 29 and both algebraic groups are smooth, we have GL(1) × Spin(Q) ∼=
G◦

w by ξ.
(I) Let gw and hw denote the Lie algebras of Gw and Hw respectively. We shall
prove that hw = D0 and dim Hw = 28. Since obviously D0 ⊂ hw, it is enough to
show that hw ⊂ D0.

Proposition 2.11, there exists X0 ∈ D0, α, β, γ ∈ O and Y ∈ J such that

c d(cid:1)(cid:1) ∈ hw ⊂ h1 ⊕ gl(2), where X ∈ h1 and(cid:0) a b

Hence, we have

t1 = t2 = t3 = −a = −d,
y1 = y2 = y3 = α = β = γ = b = c = 0.
Since Tr(Y) = 0, 3t1 = 0 (ch(k) 6= 3). Therefore, Y = 0, ( a b
γ = 0. Thus, Z = X0, and so hw = D0. Then, we also have dim Hw ≤ dim hw =
dim D0 = 28.

c d(cid:1) = 0 and α = β =

Since dim Hw + dim H(w) = dim H (H(w) is the orbit), we have

dim Hw = dim H − dim H(w) ≥ dim H − dim V ≥ 82 − 54 = 28.

It follows that dim Hw = 28. Since dim H = 82 and Hw = 28, dim H(w) = 54.
Moreover, it is a dense subset of V.

We show that dim Gw = 29. Since dim H1 = dim h1 = 78, by the exact sequence
(1.6), we have dim G1 = 79. Thus, since the dimension of the G-orbit of w is also
54 and dim G = 83, we have dim Gw = 29. Since G(w) is a constructible subset
which is irreducible, it is locally closed. Moreover, since dim G(w) = 54 = dim V,
G(w) is open in V. It follows that the condition of Deﬁnition 1.9 (i) is satisﬁed. We
pointed out in Introduction that V is an irreducible representation and that there
exists a relative invariant polynomial. So we have (2) of the proposition.

We prove that Gw is smooth. For that purpose, it is enough to show that dim gw =
dim Gw = 29. Let g1 denote the Lie algebra of G1. We deﬁne dc and dc′ by
the Lie algebra homomorphisms induced by the characters c : G1 → GL(1) and
c′ : G → GL(1) respectively (see (1.8)). Then,

g1 =(cid:26)L ∈ gl(J )

∀X ∈ J , det ((1 + εL)(X)) = c(1 + εL) det(X)

= (1 + εdc(L)) det(X)(cid:27) .

For a ∈ k,

det((1 + aε)I27(X)) = (1 + aε)3 det(X) = (1 + 3aε) det(X).

So dc(aI27) = 3a. Since ch(k) 6= 3, dc : g1 → gl(1) is surjective. Hence, the
sequence

0 → h1 → g1 → gl(1) → 0

is exact. For L = (L1, L2) ∈ gw ⊂ g1 ⊕ gl(2), if dc′(L) = 0, then dc(L1) = 0.
It follows that L1 ∈ h1 and L ∈ hw. Since dc′ ((aI27, −aI2)) = 3a ∈ gl(1), the
restriction of dc′ on gw is also surjective. Hence, the following sequence

0 → hw → gw → gl(1) → 0

is exact. Therefore, dim gw = 29 and Gw is smooth.

(II) We shall construct an injective homomorphism ξ : GL(1)×Spin(Q) → Gw.

Let Z = (t, (A, B, C)) ∈ GL(1) × Spin(Q). Note that we are identifying Spin(Q)

with M. We prove that ξ0(Z) ∈ G1. For any X in the form (1.3), we have

ξ0(Z)X =

− ts1ktA(x1)k − ts2ktB(x2)k − ts3ktC(x3)k.

Since A, B, C ∈ SO(Q), they preserve the inner product. Thus, we have ktA(x1)k =
t2kx1k, ktB(x2)k = t2kx2k, ktC(x3)k = t2kx3k and

tr (tA(x1)tB(x2)tC(x3)) = t3tr(cid:16)C(x1x2)C(x3)(cid:17) = 2t3Q (x1x2, x3)

= t3tr(x1x2x3).

Therefore, det(ξ0(Z)X) = t3det(X), and so ξ0(Z) ∈ G1.

We deﬁne a homomorphism ξ by

ξ : GL(1) × Spin(Q) ∋ Z = (t, (A, B, C)) 7→ (ξ0(Z), t−1 I2) ∈ G1 × GL(2).

By (3.9), Im(ξ) ⊂ Gw. Since GL(1) × Spin(Q) is connected, we have Im(ξ) ⊂ G◦
w.
Moreover, ξ is obviously injective and deﬁned over k. Thus, since dim GL(1) ×
Spin(Q) = 29, we have dim ξ(GL(1) × Spin(Q)) = 29.

τ1, τ2 ∈ Gw. Let hτ1, τ2i denote the ﬁnite subgroup of Gw generated by τ1, τ2. It is
easy to see that |hτ1, τ2i| = 6.

1 = τ2

For g ∈ Gw, we deﬁne Ig ∈ Aut(Gw) by

Ig : Gw ∋ x 7→ gxg−1 ∈ Gw.

w is a normal subgroup of Gw, by restricting Ig to G◦
w, Ig induces an element
w). Moreover, since GL(1) is contained in the center of Gw, Ig also induces

Since G◦
of Aut(G◦
an element of Aut(Spin(Q)). So, we regard Ig ∈ Aut(Spin(Q)). Then, the map

Gw ∋ g 7→ Ig ∈ Aut(Spin(Q))

RATIONAL ORBITS OF THE SPACE OF PAIRS OF EXCEPTIONAL JORDAN ALGEBRAS

19

is a homomorphism. We denote this homomorphism by I.
We deﬁne a subgroup Inn(Spin(Q)) of Aut(Spin(Q)) by

Inn(Spin(Q)) = {Ih ∈ Aut(Spin(Q)) | h ∈ Spin(Q)}.

Since Spin(Q) is a group of type D4 and the automorphism group of the Dynkin di-
agram of D4 is S3, by Proposition 2.19(ii) and [2, p.190, Proposition], the following
sequence

(3.11)

0 → Inn(Spin(Q)) → Aut(Spin(Q)) → S3 → 0

is exact. We denote the above homomorphism from Aut(Spin(Q)) to S3 by f . The
deﬁnition of f is as follows. For Z = (Z1, Z2, Z3) ∈ Spin(Q), we deﬁne pri(Z) =
Zi (i = 1, 2, 3). For any x ∈ Aut(Spin(Q)) and i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, pri ◦ x is an irreducible
representation of Spin(Q) on O and equivalent to some prj where j ∈ {1, 2, 3}.
Then we deﬁne f (x)(i) = j.

We denote the composition of homomorphisms

Gw

I→ Aut(Spin(Q))

f
→ S3

by ϕ. It is easy to see that the representation Z = (Z1, Z2, Z3) 7→ bZi is equivalent to
pri for i = 1, 2, 3. Since Iτ1(Z) = (bZ2,bZ1,bZ3), Iτ2(Z) = (bZ1,bZ3,bZ2), we have

(3.12)
It follows that ϕ(hτ1, τ2i) = S3. Since |hτ1, τ2i| = 6, hτ1, τ2i ∼= S3 and ϕ : Gw → S3
is surjective.

ϕ(τ1) = (1 2), ϕ(τ2) = (2 3).

We deﬁne another natural homomorphism from Gw to S3 as follows. For x =

x1v1 + x2v2 ∈ V, let Fx be the cubic form deﬁned in (1.11). For x ∈ V, we deﬁne

(3.13)

Zero(x) = {q ∈ P1

k | Fx(q) = 0}.

We call Zero(x) the zero set of x. Note that this is well-deﬁned since Fx is homoge-
neous. We express elements of P1

k by row vectors as q = (q1, q2).

We shall deﬁne an action of Gx on Zero(x). For any g = (g1, g2) ∈ Gx,

Fx(v) = Fgx(v) = c(g1)Fx(vg2).

It follows that if q ∈ Zero(x), then qg2 also belongs to Zero(x). Hence, we can
deﬁne a right action of Gx on Zero(x) by

Gx × Zero(x) ∋ ((g1, g2), q) 7→ qg2 ∈ Zero(x).

Let Zero(x) = {qx,1, qx,2, qx,3}. For g = (g1, g2) ∈ Gx, let ηx(g) ∈ S3 be the element
such that qx,ig2 = qx,ηx(g)(i) for i = 1, 2, 3.

We deﬁne a map ηx by

(3.14)

ηx : Gx ∋ g 7→ ηx(g) ∈ S3.

For any qx,i ∈ Zero(x), g = (g1, g2) and h = (h1, h2) ∈ Gx,
(3.15)

qx,η(gh)(i) = qx,ig2h2 = qx,η(g)(i)h2 = qx,η(h)(η(g)(i)).

Thus,

ηx(gh)(i) = ηx(h)(ηx (g)(i)).

20

RYO KATO AND AKIHIKO YUKIE

Therefore, the map ηx : Gx → S3 is a homomorphism. The deﬁnition of ηx de-
pends on the order of {qx,1, qx,2, qx,3} but its conjugacy class depends only on x.

We remind the reader that w ∈ Vk is the element deﬁned in (1.13). By direct

computation, we have Fw(v1, v2) = v1v2(v1 − v2). It follows that

Zero(w) = {(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0)} ⊂ Pk
1.

By choosing qw,1 = (0, 1), qw,2 = (1, 1), qw,3 = (1, 0), we obtain a homomorphism
ηw : Gw → S3. We shall show at the end of this section that the following diagram
is commutative.

Next, we show that the following sequence

(3.17)

0 → G◦

w → Gw

ϕ
→ S3 → 0

is exact and split. We may assume that k is algebraically closed. Since ϕ is surjec-
tive, we only have to show that G◦
w ⊂ Ker(ϕ).
So we shall show that G◦

w = Ker(ϕ). Since G◦

w is connected, G◦

w ⊃ Ker(ϕ).

Let g = (g1, g2) ∈ Ker(ϕ) ⊂ G1 × GL(2). Since g ∈ Ker(ϕ), f (Ig) = 1. Hence,
by the exact sequence (3.11), Ig ∈ Inn(Spin(Q)). It follows that there exists h ∈
Spin(Q) such that Igh is trivial on Spin(Q) (since k = k). Thus, we may assume
that Ig is trivial on Spin(Q).

Since g commutes with all elements of Spin(Q), g1 preserves each irreducible

non-equivalent representation of Spin(Q) in J . Thus, g1 is in the block form:

where A0 ∈ GL(3), A1, A2, A3 ∈ GL(O). Moreover, since AiZi = Zi Ai for all
i ∈ {1, 2, 3} and Z = (Z1, Z2, Z3) ∈ Spin(Q), by Schur’s lemma [3, p.7] (k = k),
there exists ci ∈ k× for i = 1, 2, 3 such that Ai = ci I8. Thus,

Let A0 = (aij)i,j=1,2,3, where aij ∈ k. Since g1 ∈ G1, there exists c ∈ k× such that

det(g1X) = c det(X) for any X ∈ J . Let

τ ∈ hτ1, τ2i such that ϕ(g) = ϕ(τ). This implies that gτ−1 ∈ G◦
w. So the GL(2) part
of gτ−1 is a scalar matrix. Thus, ηw(gτ−1) is the unit element of S3. So we have
ηw(g) = ηw(τ) = ϕ(τ) = ϕ(g). Therefore, the diagram (3.16) is commutative.

4. RATIONAL ORBITS

In this section, we determine the arithmetic interpretation of the set of rational
orbits. We have determined the stabilizer in the previous section. This and Theo-
rem 1.15 enable us to reduce the consideration to that of Galois cohomology. Since
H1(k, GL(1)) = {1}, we have to interpret the set H1(k, Spin(Q) ⋊ S3). We ﬁrst
present an alternative description of Spin(Q) ⋊ S3.

We denote the cubic subalgebra ∑3

i=1 kEi of J by t. We deﬁne an algebraic group

Aut(J , t) by

Aut(J , t) = {L ∈ F4 | L(t) = t}

(see (2.7) for the deﬁnition of F4) and denote the Lie algebra of Aut(J , t) by a(J , t).
Then

a(J , t) = {L ∈ f | L(t) ⊂ t}.

Lemma 4.1. a(J , t) = D0.

if X ∈ a(J , t), then we have α = β = γ = 0. Hence, we have a(J , t) ⊂ D0. The

(cid:3)

Let pr1 be the natural projection from G to G1 as in Introduction. Let P =
∼= P. Since
pr1(S3). Then it is easy to see that pr1 induces an isomorphism S3
all elements in Spin(Q) preserve three octonions Oi where i = 1, 2, 3 (see (2.6)) in
J and such an element in P is only 1, Spin(Q) ∩ P = {1}. So pr1 induces an iso-
∼= Spin(Q) ⋊ P. The following lemma is an alternative
morphism Spin(Q) ⋊ S3
description of Spin(Q) ⋊ S3.

Lemma 4.2. Spin(Q) ⋊ P = Aut(J , t).

Proof. Since Spin(Q) acts trivially on t (elements of Spin(Q) are in the form (3.9)
where t = 1) and all elements in P preserve t (see (3.10)), we have (Spin(Q) ⋊ P) ⊂
Aut(J , t). It follows that

28 = dim Spin(Q) ⋊ P ≤ dim Aut(J , t) ≤ dim a(J , t) = 28.

In particular, dim Aut(J , t) = dim a(J , t) = 28 and Aut(J , t) is smooth. We
have shown in the step (I) of the proof of Proposition 2.11 that D0 = so(Q). So
by Lemma 4.1, Lie(Spin(Q) ⋊ P) = a(J , t). Since both Spin(Q) ⊂ Aut(J , t)
are smooth, the identity component of Aut(J , t) coincides with Spin(Q). There-
fore, we may assume that k = k and prove that Aut(J , t)k ⊂ (Spin(Q) ⋊ P)k
set-theoretically.

By the above consideration, Spin(Q) is a normal subgroup of Aut(J , t). Hence,

we can deﬁne a homomorphism from Aut(J , t) to Aut(Spin(Q)) by

I : Aut(J , t) → Aut(Spin(Q))

∈

g

∈

7→ Ig : X 7→ gXg−1

for X ∈ Spin(Q).

Since Spin(Q) ⋊ P ⊂ Aut(J , t) and the restriction of I to Spin(Q) ⋊ P is surjec-
tive, I is also surjective. Hence, for g ∈ Aut(J , t), by multiplying an element of
Spin(Q) ⋊ P, we may assume that Ig is trivial. Then, by the same argument as in
Section 3, we have

(4.3)

1 = a2c2

2 = a3c2

3 = c1c2c3

(see (3.18), (3.19)).

Since g ∈ Aut(J , t) ⊂ F4 = Aut(J ), we have g(e) = e. So a1 = a2 = a3 = 1. By

(4.3), we have c2

1 = c2

2 = c2

3 = c1c2c3. It follows that

(c1, c2, c3) = (1, 1, 1), (1, −1, −1), (−1, 1, −1) or (−1, −1, 1).

Thus, g ∈ Spin(Q). Therefore, Aut(J , t)k ⊂ (Spin(Q) ⋊ P)k.

(cid:3)

We shall consider the interpretation of H1(k, Gw). We have shown in Section 3
∼= GL(1) × (Spin(Q) ⋊ S3). Note that H1(k, GL(n)) = {1} for all n. So
that Gw
H1(k, Gw), H1(k, G) can be identiﬁed with H1(k, Spin(Q) ⋊ S3), H1(k, G1) respec-

tively. So by Lemma 4.2, we may consider Ker(cid:0)H1(k, Aut(J , t)) → H1(k, G1)(cid:1).

Let M be a Jordan algebra over k and n be a cubic ´etale subalgebra of M over
k. If there exists an isomorphism between M and J over ksep which induces an
isomorphism between n and t over ksep, we call (M, n) a k-form of (J , t). Two
k-forms (J1, t1), (J2, t2) are said to be equivalent if there exists an isomorphism
between J1 and J2 over k which induces an isomorphism between t1 and t2 over
k. Note that even if two cubic ´etale subalgebras t1 and t2 are isomorphic over k,
two k-forms (J , t1) and (J , t2) may not be equivalent.

We shall give a correspondence between H1(k, Aut(J , t)) and the set of k-forms

of (J , t).

Suppose that M is a k-form of J . For σ ∈ Gal(ksep/k), let vM(σ) be the semi-

linear homomorphism

vM(σ) : Mksep = ksep ⊗ M ∋ ∑ ai ⊗ mi 7→ ∑ aσ

i ⊗ mi ∈ ksep ⊗ M.

We deﬁne a map

(4.4)

A : H1(k, Aut(J , t)) → {equivalence classes of k-forms of (J , t)}

as follows.

Let c ∈ H1(k, Aut(J , t)) be the element determined by a 1-cocycle h with coefﬁ-

cients in Aut(J , t)ksep. We deﬁne

M(h) = {X ∈ Jksep | h1(σ)vJ (σ)(X) = X},

n(h) = {Y ∈ tksep | h1(σ)vJ (σ)(Y) = Y}.

Then, M(h), n(h) are closed under the addition and the multiplication of Jksep
since h(σ) ∈ F4 ksep and the action of the Galois group commutes with the addition
and the multiplication of Jksep. So (M(h), n(h)) is a k-form of (J , t). We deﬁne
A(h) = (M(h), n(h)). One can show by the standard argument that A(h) depends
only on the cohomology class c. By abuse of notation, we use the notation A(c)
also.

Next, we deﬁne a map

B : {equivalence classes of k-forms of (J , t)} → H1(k, Aut(J , t))

as follows.

RATIONAL ORBITS OF THE SPACE OF PAIRS OF EXCEPTIONAL JORDAN ALGEBRAS

25

Let (M, n) be a k-form of (J , t). Let φ : Mksep → Jksep be an isomorphism of
Jordan algebras which induces an isomorphism from nksep to tksep. Then we deﬁne
a map hM from Gal(ksep/k) to GL(J )ksep by

hM(σ) = φ vM(σ) φ−1vJ (σ)−1.

Then one can show by an easy computation, that hM is 1-cocycle with coefﬁcients
in Aut(J , t)ksep. Let B((M, n)) be the element of H1(k, Aut(J , t)) determined by
hM. This deﬁnition is also well-deﬁned.

The proof of the following proposition is standard and is left to the reader.

Proposition 4.5. The maps A, B are the inverses of each other and so

A : H1(k, Gw) → {equivalence classes of k-forms of (J , t)}

is bijective.

We next consider the interpretation of the set Ker(cid:0)H1(k, Gw) → H1(k, G1)(cid:1).

We ﬁrst deﬁne the notion of isotopes of J . For m ∈ J such that det(m) 6= 0, we
can associate a Jordan algebra Jm related to m as follows. The underlying vector
space of Jm is J . We deﬁne

hx, yim = −6 det(m)−1D(x, y, m) + 9 det(m)−2D(x, m, m)D(y, m, m),

for x, y ∈ J . It is known that Jm is a Jordan algebra with x ◦m y, hx, xim and m as
the product, the norm and the unit element. Moreover, there is an isomorphism of
Jordan algebras Jm ⊗ ksep → J ⊗ ksep. This construction is given in [12, p.155].

Note that if the octonion is split, then all isotopes of J are isomorphic to J over
k (it follows from the three facts [p. 155, Proposition 5.9.2], [p. 147, Proposition
5.6.2] and [p. 153, Proposition 5.8.2]).

For an arbitrary k-from M of J , the notion of the determinant on M is deﬁned
as follows. Let φ : Mksep → Jksep be an isomorphism. For any X ∈ M, we deﬁne
detM on M by detM(X) = det(φ(X)). Since automorphisms of J preserve the
determinant on J (see [12, p.133, Proposition 5.3.10]), detM is independent of the
choice of the isomorphism φ and is deﬁned over k.

It is also known that the determinant detm on Jm satisﬁes the following equation:

(4.6)

detm(x) = det(m)−1 det(x)

for x ∈ J (see [12, p.155, Proposition 5.9.2]).

Let JIC(k) be the set of equivalence classes of pairs (Jm, n) of isotopes of J and
their cubic ´etale subalgebras. We show that elements in JIC(k) correspond to ele-

ments in Ker(cid:0)H1(k, Gw) → H1(k, G)(cid:1) bijectively.

Let h be a 1-cocycle with coefﬁcients in Gw ksep which corresponds to (M, n).
We write h = (h1, h2) where h(σ) = (h1(σ), h2(σ)) and h1(σ) ∈ G1 ksep, h2(σ) ∈
GL(2)ksep .

Let c ∈ H1(k, Gw) be the cohomology class determined by h and A(c) = (M, n).

Suppose that c ∈ Ker(cid:0)H1(k, Gw) → H1(k, G)(cid:1). Since h is trivial in H1(k, G), there

26

RYO KATO AND AKIHIKO YUKIE

exists g = (g1, g2) ∈ Gksep such that

h(σ) = g−1gσ

for any σ ∈ Gal(ksep/k).

For g = (g1, g2) ∈ G, we deﬁne an element of G1 by
µg = c(g1) det(g2)2g1 ∈ G1.

(4.7)
Note that the map g → µg is a homomorphism. If g ∈ Gw ksep, then by Theorem 3.1
and its proof, there exist t ∈ k, u ∈ Spin(Q), τ ∈ hτ1, τ2i such that g = (tu, t−1 I2)τ.
So by computation,

µg = c(tupr1(τ))(t−4)tupr1(τ) = upr1(τ)

(4.8)
where pr1 is the natural projection from G to G1. It follows that µg ∈ (Spin(Q) ⋊
P)ksep = Aut(J , t)ksep.

For the above 1-cocycle h, since a = (cid:0)c(g1) det(g2)2 I27, (c(g1) det(g2)2)−1I2(cid:1) ∈

Gw ksep, we may substitute a−1h(σ)aσ for h(σ) for any σ ∈ Gal(ksep/k). Then
h1(σ) = µ−1

g = µg−1gσ.

g µσ

We show that there exists m ∈ J with det(m) 6= 0 such that M is isomorphic
to Jm. Let µg(e) = m. Since g−1gσ ∈ Gw ksep, µg−1gσ ∈ Aut(J , t)ksep ⊂ F4 ksep.
Therefore, we have µ−1

g(e) = e. So

g µσ

vJ (σ)(m) = vJ (σ)(µg(e)) = vJ (σ)(µg(vJ (σ)−1(vJ (σ)(e))))

= µσ

g(vJ (σ)(e)) = µσ

g(e) = µg(e) = m

for any σ ∈ Gal(ksep/k). Hence, we have m ∈ J .

It is known that all isotopes are isomorphic over ksep (it follows from [12, p.158,
Proposition 5.9.3] and the proof of [12, p.181, Theorem 7.3.2]). So there exists an
isomorphism φ : Jksep → Jm ksep. Since φ−1µg(e) = e, by (2.8), φ−1µg ∈ F4 ksep.
Thus, µg (= φφ−1µg) is an isomorphism from Jksep to Jm ksep. Since

(4.9)

M = {X ∈ Jksep | µσ

g(vJ (σ)(X)) = µg(X),
= {X ∈ Jksep | vJ (σ)(µg(X)) = µg(X),
= µ−1

g (J )

∀σ ∈ Gal(ksep/k)}
∀σ ∈ Gal(ksep/k)}

,

the k-linear map µg : M → Jm is a k-linear isomorphism. Therefore, M ∼= Jm as
Jordan algebras over k.

Conversely, suppose that m ∈ J , det(m) 6= 0 and n is a cubic ´etale subalgebra

of Jm. We show that B((Jm, n)) ∈ Ker(cid:0)H1(k, Gw) → H1(k, G)(cid:1).

If k = ksep, then all cubic ´etale algebras are isomorphic to (ksep)3. So there exist
three idempotents u1, u2, u3 such that ui’s are pairwise orthogonal and u1 + u2 +
u3 is the unit element. So for any cubic ´etale subalgebras n1, n2 of J , there exist
ui1, ui2, ui3 ∈ ni ksep for i = 1, 2 which satisfy the above conditions. Since O is split
if k = ksep, the map O×
ksep ∋ x 7→ kxk ∈ (ksep)× is surjective. In the situation where
k = ksep, by [1, p.413, THEOREM 9], there exists φ ∈ F4 ksep such that φ(u1j) = u2j for
j = 1, 2, 3. Then φ(n1 ksep) = n2 ksep.

For any (Jm, n), there exists an isomorphism φ1 : Jm ksep → Jksep. By the above
argument, there exists φ2 ∈ F4ksep such that φ2(φ1(nksep)) = tksep. Then φ2φ1 :

RATIONAL ORBITS OF THE SPACE OF PAIRS OF EXCEPTIONAL JORDAN ALGEBRAS

27

Jm ksep → Jksep is an isomorphism which induces an isomorphism from nksep to
tksep. So (Jm, n) is a k-form of (J , t). Moreover, the map σ 7→ φ vJm(σ) φ−1vJ (σ)−1
is a 1-cocycle which deﬁnes the cohomology class B((Jm, n)).

Since the determinant on Jm ksep satisﬁes (4.6) and det(φ(X)) = detm(X) for any

X ∈ Jm ksep , we have φ ∈ G1 ksep. It follows that B((Jm, n)) ∈ Ker(cid:0)H1(k, Gw) →
H1(k, G)(cid:1). Thus, elements in JIC(k) correspond to elements in Ker(cid:0)H1(k, Gw) →
H1(k, G1)(cid:1) bijectively.

Therefore, by the above argument and Theorem 1.15, we have the following

interpretation of the set of rational orbits.

Theorem 4.10. The following map
Gk\Vss

k ∋ x 7→ A(cx) ∈ JIC(k)

(see (1.15) for the deﬁnition of cx) is bijective.

5. EQUIVARIANT MAP

In Section 4, we have shown that elements of the set Ker(cid:0)H1(k, Gw) → H1(k, G)(cid:1)

are in bijective correspondence with equivalence classes of pairs (Jm, n) of isotopes
of J and their cubic subalgebras. In this section, for any x ∈ Vss
k , we construct
explicitly the isotope of J and its cubic subalgebra corresponding to x in Theorem
4.10 by an equivariant map from V to J .

Before deﬁning an equivariant map, we review some properties of the cross
product. The following formulas are proved in [12, p.154] and [12, pp.122-123,
Lemma 5.1.2].

Lemma 5.1. The following equations are satisﬁed for all x, y ∈ J .

(iii) (x × x) × (x × x) = det(x)x.
(iv) 4x × (y × (x × x)) = det(x)y + hx, yix × x.
(v) 4(x × x) × (x × y) = det(x)y + 3D(x, x, y)x.
(vi) 4(x × y) × (x × y) = −2(x × x) × (y × y) + 3D(x, y, y)x + 3D(x, x, y)y.

The following lemma is proved in [12, p.180, Proposition 7.3.1].

For any g ∈ GL(J ), we deﬁneeg ∈ GL(J ) by
hg(x),eg(y)i = hx, yi,
Lemma 5.2. The map g 7→ eg is an automorphism of H1 with order 2 and the following

∀x, y ∈ J .

∀x, y ∈ J

equations:

are satisﬁed.

g(x × y) =eg(x) ×eg(y), eg(x × y) = g(x) × g(y)

We deﬁne a map m : V = J ⊗ Aff2 → J by
m(x1v1 + x2v2) = 6(x1 × x1) × (x2 × x2) − 3D(x1, x2, x2)x1 − 3D(x1, x1, x2)x2.

28

RYO KATO AND AKIHIKO YUKIE

We deﬁne an action of G on J by

(5.3)

G × J ∋ ((g1, g2), x) 7→ c(g1)(det(g2))2g1(x) ∈ J .

Proposition 5.4. For any (g1, g2) ∈ G and x1v1 + x2v2 ∈ V,

m ((g1, g2)(x1v1 + x2v2)) = c(g1) det(g2)2g1(m (x1v1 + x2v2)) .

Proof. We ﬁrst prove that the map m is GL(2)-equivariant. Since GL(2) is generated
by upper triangular matrices and ( 0 1
1 0 ), it is enough to consider these two cases. We
denote m(x1v1 + x2v2) by m(x1, x2). For any upper triangular matrix g2 = ( a b

0 d(cid:1),

m(ax1 + bx2, dx2) = 6 ((ax1 + bx2) × (ax1 + bx2)) × (dx2 × dx2)

−3D(ax1 + bx2, dx2, dx2)(ax1 + bx2)
−3D(ax1 + bx2, ax1 + bx2, dx2)dx2

= a2d2{6(x1 × x1) × (x2 × x2)

−3D(x1, x2, x2)x1 − 3D(x1, x1, x2)x2}
+12abd2(x1 × x2) × (x2 × x2) + 6b2d2(x2 × x2) × (x2 × x2)

= a2d2m(x1, x2) (by (v))

For g2 = ( 0 1

1 0 ), by deﬁnition, m(g2(x1v1 + x2v2)) = m(x2, x1) = m(x1, x2). There-

We next prove that m is G1-equivariant. For any g ∈ H1, by Lemma 5.2,

g ((x × y) × (z × w)) = (eg(x × y)) × (eg(z × w))

= (g(x) × g(y)) × (g(z) × g(w))

for x, y, z, w ∈ J . For any g1 ∈ G1 ksep, since ch(k) 6= 3, there exists t ∈ ksep such
that t3 = c(g1). Then t−1g1 ∈ H1 ksep. So

g1 ((x × y) × (z × w)) = t(t−1g1) ((x × y) × (z × w))

= t(cid:16)t−1g1(x) × t−1g1(y)(cid:17) ×(cid:16)t−1g1(z) × t−1g1(w)(cid:17)

= c(g1)−1 (g1(x) × g1(y)) × (g1(z) × g1(w))

for x, y, z, w ∈ J . It follows that

g1 (m(x1, x2)) = 6g1((x1 × x1) × (x2 × x2))

−3D(x1, x2, x2)g1(x1) − 3D(x1, x1, x2)g1(x2)

= c(g)−1(m (g1(x1), g1(x2))) .

Therefore, for any (g1, g2) ∈ G, we have

(5.5)

m ((g1, g2)(x1v1 + x2v2)) = c(g1) det(g2)2g1(m (x1v1 + x2v2)) .

RATIONAL ORBITS OF THE SPACE OF PAIRS OF EXCEPTIONAL JORDAN ALGEBRAS

(cid:3)

For x ∈ Vss

k , to deﬁne the isotope Jm(x) of J , det(m(x)) must not be equal to 0.

So we need the following lemma.

Lemma 5.6. For w = w1v1 + w2v2 ∈ V in (1.13), m(w) = e. In particular, Jm(w) = J .

Proof. By direct computation, we have

w1 × w1 = −E3, w2 × w2 = −E1, (w1 × w1) × (w2 × w2) =

D(w1, w1, w2) =

1
3

, D(w1, w2, w2) = −

1
3

,

(see (2.4) for the deﬁnition of E1, E2, E3). So

1
2

E2,

m(w) = 6(w1 × w1) × (w2 × w2) − 3D(w1, w2, w2)w1 − 3D(w1, w1, w2)w2

= 3E2 + w1 − w2
= e.

It is known that the multiplication in Je is the same as that of J (see [12, p.158]).
(cid:3)

So Jm(w) = J .

By the above lemma and Proposition 5.4, the map x 7→ det(m(x)) is a non-trivial
relative invariant polynomial of degree 12. So x ∈ Vss if and only if det(m(x)) 6= 0.
Thus, for all x ∈ Vss

k , we can deﬁne the isotope Jm(x) of J .

We next deﬁne a subspace t(x) of J which is a cubic ´etale k-subalgebra with
respect to the multiplication in Jm(x) for x = x1v1 + x2v2 ∈ Vss
k . We shall show that
the pair (Jm(x), t(x)) is a k-form of (J , t) which is equivalent to A(cx) in Theorem
4.10.

Let t(x) be the vector space spanned by x1, x2 and m(x). Since m(w) = e, it is

easy to see that t(w) = t. For any g1 ∈ G1, by Proposition 5.4,

t((g1, I2)(x)) = g1 (t(x)) .

Moreover, it is easy to see that t(x) is GL(2)-invariant. Hence, for any g ∈ G, we
have

t(g(x)) = g1 (t(x)) .

We show that t(x) is a cubic ´etale subalgebra of Jm(x). For g = (g1, g2) ∈ Gksep,
let µg = c(g1) det(g2)2g1 ∈ G1 ksep (see (4.7) also). For any x = x1v1 + x2v2 ∈ Vss
k ,
there exists g = (g1, g2) ∈ Gksep such that gw = x. Then,

(5.7)

m(x) = m(gw) = c(g1) det(g2)2g1(m(w)) = µg(e).

By the same argument as the one just before (4.9), the equation (5.7) implies that
the linear map µg : Jksep → Jm(x) ksep is an isomorphism.

Moreover, since

t(x)ksep = t(gw)ksep = g1(t(w)ksep ) = g1(tksep) = µg(tksep),

t(x)ksep is a cubic ´etale subalgebra of Jm(x) ksep. Since the multiplication in Jm(x) ksep
is deﬁned over k, t(x) is a cubic ´etale subalgebra of Jm(x). Moreover, (Jm(x), t(x))
is a k-form of (J , t).

30

RYO KATO AND AKIHIKO YUKIE

By the argument above, the pair (Jm(x), t(x)) corresponds to the cohomology
class cx ∈ H1(k, Gw) (see (1.14) for the deﬁnition of cx). Therefore, we have the
following theorem.

Theorem 5.8. The following map is bijective.

Gk\Vss

k ∋ x 7→ (Jm(x), t(x)) ∈ JIC(k).

Since the product structure on Jm is deﬁned by homogeneous polynomials of
degree 11, the product structure on Jm(x) is deﬁned by homogeneous polynomials
of degree 44. However, it is possible to construct an equivariant map from V to
Homk(J ⊗ J , J ) deﬁned by homogeneous polynomials of degree 8. For this,
see [7].

6. THE SPLIT CASE

The purpose of this section is to prove Theorem 1.19. For that purpose we need

some preparation.

When we consider actions of Gal(ksep/k) on Sn (n is a positive integer) in this
section, we always consider the trivial action of the Galois group. So if {h(σ)}
is a 1-cocycle with coefﬁcients in Sn, then Gal(ksep/k) ∋ σ 7→ h(σ)−1 ∈ Sn is a
homomorphism by Deﬁnition 2.2. We identify H1(k, Sn) with conjugacy classes of
homomorphisms from Gal(ksep/k) to Sn in this manner.

We use the space of pairs of ternary quadratic forms in order to prove Theorem
1.19. The interpretation of rational orbits in this case was carried out in [14]. We
ﬁrst review this case and point out properties which will be needed in this section.
Let V1 be the space of ternary quadratic forms. Since ch(k) 6= 2, we may identify
V1 space of symmetric 3 × 3 matrices. Let G1 = GL(3). If g ∈ G1 and x ∈ V1,
then we deﬁne ρ1(g)x = gxtg. This deﬁnes a representation of G1 on V1. Let
G = GL(3) × GL(2). Regarding Aff2 as the standard representation of GL(2), V =
V1 ⊗ Aff2 is a representation of G. We use the notation ρ(g) for this representation.
The representations ρ1, ρ can be extended to representations on J , V respectively
by the same formulas. Note that elements of k commute with elements of O and
so the order of multiplication does not matter. We later show (Corollary 6.19) that
ρ1(g1) ∈ G1 (resp. ρ(g) ∈ G) for g1 ∈ GL(3) (resp. g ∈ G).

We express elements of V as x = (x1, x2) (x1, x2 ∈ V1) or x = x1v1 + x2v2 us-
ing variables v = (v1, v2). If x ∈ V1, the determinant deﬁned by (1.4) coincides
with the usual determinant. It is well-known that (G, V ) is a regular prehomoge-
neous vector space and if we express elements of V as x = x1v1 + x2v2, then the
discriminant of the cubic form Fx(v) (see (1.11)) is a relative invariant polynomial.
Therefore, x ∈ V is semi-stable with respect to the action of G if and only if it is
semi-stable as an element of V with respect to the action of G.

If x = (x1, x2) ∈ Vk, then x1, x2 deﬁne two conics in P2
k

. Let ZeroP2(x) ⊂ P2
k

be
the intersection of these two conics. This should not be confused with Zero(x) ⊂
P1
and x = gy, then it is easy to
k
see that ZeroP2(x) = ZeroP2(y)g−1
In particular, if g = (g1, g2) ∈ Gx k, then
1 .
ZeroP2(x) = ZeroP2(x)g−1

(see (3.13)). If g = (g1, g2) ∈ Gk, x, y ∈ V ss
k

1 and so ZeroP2(x) = ZeroP2(x)g1 also.

The following proposition is proved in [14, pp.290, Propositions 1.5, 1.6].

Proposition 6.1. Suppose that x ∈ Vk. Then x ∈ V ss
k
of four distinct points. Moreover, if x ∈ V ss

if and only if ZeroP2(x) consists

Note that the second statement is now a consequence of [15].
If x ∈ V ss

k , ZeroP2(x) = {px,1, . . . , px,4} and g ∈ Gx k, then let γx(g) ∈ S4 be the

element such that

(6.2)

px,jg = px,γx(g)(j)

for j = 1, . . . , 4. Then γx : Gx k ∋ g 7→ γx(g) ∈ S4 is a homomorphism.

The element w in Section 1 of [14] is not w in this paper, but is the following

element:

We denote τ1, τ2, τ3 in [14, p.289] by τ1, τ2, τ3 in this paper. It is easy to see that
τ1, τ2, τ3 generate a subgroup of Gw′ k which is isomorphic to S4 and maps isomor-

Therefore,

(6.4)

ρ(g−1τ1g) = τ1, ρ(g−1τ2g) = τ2, ρ(g−1τ3g) = τ1(−I8, −I8, I8),

where τ1, τ2 are the elements in (3.10) and (I8, −I8, −I8) ∈ Spin(Q) (with the un-
derstanding that elements of Spin(Q) act on diagonal entries of elements of J
trivially). Note that τ1, τ2, τ1(−I8, −I8, I8) correspond to (1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 2) ∈ S3
by the homomorphism ηw from Gw to S3 (see (3.14) and (3.22)). These elements

32

generate a subgroup of Gw k which is isomorphic to S4. We identify S4 with this
subgroup.

For x ∈ V ss

k , let ZeroP2(x) = {px,1, . . . , px,4}. We deﬁne a map φx : Gal(ksep/k) →

S4 by

Therefore, φx and ψx are conjugate. Hence, if we identify H1(k, S4) with conjugacy
classes of homomorphims from Gal(ksep/k) to S4, then the action of Gal(ksep/k)
on {1, 2, 3, 4} can be identiﬁed with the action of Gal(ksep/k) on ZeroP2(x) up to
conjugation.

Lemma (1.8)] also).

very easy to prove that (H, W ) is a regular prehomogeneous vector space, w′′ =

Let ZeroP1(x) = {qx,1, qx,2, qx,3}. For g = (g1, g2) ∈ H, let θx(g) ∈ S3 be the

element such that

for i = 1, 2, 3. We deﬁne a map θx by

qx,i g2 = qx,θx(g)(i)

θx : H ∋ g 7→ θx(g) ∈ S3.

λx(σ) = θw′′(g−1

(6.9)

x,i = qx,κx(σ)(i)

for σ ∈ Gal(ksep/k) and i = 1, 2, 3. Then κx is also a homomorphism and as in the
case of V, κx and λx are conjugate. So when we consider conjugacy classes, κx and
λx can be identiﬁed.

We now start the proof of Theorem 1.19.

Proof of Theorem 1.19. Let h1
ηw : H1(k, Gw) → H1(k, S3) be the map induced by
ηw. This of course induces a map from the subset Ker(H1(k, Gw) → H1(k, G))
of H1(k, Gw) to H1(k, S3). We ﬁrst prove that if this map from Ker(H1(k, Gw) →
H1(k, G)) to H1(k, S3) is a bijection, then the element of H1(k, S3) which corre-
sponds to the orbit of x ∈ Vss
is the one obtained by the action of Gal(ksep/k)
k
on the set Zero(x). Note that the set Ker(H1(k, Gw) → H1(k, G)) is in bijective
correspondence with Gk\Vss
k .

We consider the homomorphism G → H deﬁned as follows:

Φ : G ∋ (g1, g2) 7→ (c(g1), g2) ∈ H.

It is easy to see that for any x ∈ V and g ∈ G, Fgx = Φ(g)(Fx ). Since Fw =
w′′, Φ(Gw) ⊂ Hw′′. By choosing qw′′,1 = (0, 1), qw′′,2 = (1, 1), qw′′,3 = (1, 0), the
deﬁnitions of ηw, θw′′ imply that the following diagram

Let x = gxw ∈ Vss

element of H1(k, Gw) as in (1.14). Then Fx corresponds to the cohomology class in

exact sequence (3.17) can be replaced by ηw by the commutativity of the diagram
(3.16). By [16, p.120, Lemma (1.8)], h1
ηw is injective. Since the sequence (3.17) is
split, it is surjective. Hence, the map h1
ηw is bijective. This completes the proof of
Theorem 1.19 for the case where k is a ﬁnite ﬁeld.

Therefore, we assume for the rest of this section that k is an inﬁnite ﬁeld and

O is the split octonion eO. The reason why we can prove the theorem when the

octonion is split is that the norm map O× → k× is surjective. Note that O× contains
GL(2)k as a subset, the restriction of the norm of O× to GL(2)k coincides with the
determinant and the determinant induces a surjective homomorphism GL(2)k →
k× (GL(2)k is a group).

What we need for later consideration about the space V is the following. First,
the stabilizer of 4 in S4 is obviously isomorphic to S3. Since this obvious subgroup
plays an important role in the subsequent proof, we name this subgroup as follows.

Deﬁnition 6.11. S = S3 ⊂ S4.

As we pointed out after (6.4) that S is generated by g−1τ1g, g−1τ2g of (6.3). As
elements of S4, these elements are the transpositions (1 2), (2 3). The equation
(3.22) implies that (1 2), (2 3) ∈ S map to (1 2), (2 3) ∈ S3 by ηw. Therefore, ηw
induces an isomorphism S ∼= S3.

We shall prove the following proposition.

Proposition 6.12. Any orbit in Gk\Vss
k . Moreover, such a
representative can be chosen so that it corresponds to a cohomology class in H1(k, S4)
which comes from H1(k, S).

k has a representative in V ss

We show that Theorem 1.19 now follows from Proposition 6.12. Suppose that

Proposition 6.12 holds.

The natural maps S → S4 → Gw → Gw → Hw′′ → S3 induce maps:
H1(k, S) → H1(k, S4) → H1(k, Gw) → H1(k, Gw) → H1(k, Hw′′) → H1(k, S3).

Note that the homomorphism Gw → S3 can be regarded as ηw. Since the map
w) ∼= H1(k, S4) is bijective (∼= means bijection) and S4 →
H1(k, Gw) → H1(k, Gw/G ◦
Gw is a section, the map H1(k, S4) → H1(k, Gw) is bijective. The map H1(k, Gw) →
H1(k, Gw) induces a map

H1(k, Gw) ∼= Ker(H1(k, Gw) → H1(k, G)) → Ker(H1(k, Gw) → H1(k, G)).

RATIONAL ORBITS OF THE SPACE OF PAIRS OF EXCEPTIONAL JORDAN ALGEBRAS

By assumption, the map

(6.13)

H1(k, S) → Ker(H1(k, Gw) → H1(k, G)) ∼= Gk\Vss
k

is surjective. Since the composition

H1(k, S) → H1(k, Gw) → H1(k, S3)

is bijective, (6.13) is injective and so bijective. Since H1(k, S) → H1(k, S3) is bijec-
tive,

Ker(H1(k, Gw) → H1(k, G)) → H1(k, S3)

is bijective and this map is induced by ηw.

We now prove Proposition 6.12.
Proof of Proposition 6.12. If x ∈ V ss
k and ZeroP2(x) has a k-rational point, then the
element of H1(k, S4) which corresponds to x comes from H1(k, S). So what we
have to prove is that any orbit in Gk\Vss

ZeroP2(x) has a k-rational point.

Proof. The proof is easy for d(α1, α2, α3). We only consider d1(α) and n21(u) since
other cases are similar.

Let α ∈ O×. It is known that for any a, x, y ∈ O,

(6.18)

a(xy)a = (ax)(ya),

a(xa) = (ax)a

(see [12, p.9, Proposition 1.4.1], [12, p.10, Lemma 1.4.2]).

We ﬁrst consider d1(α) (α ∈ O×). Let X be as in (1.3). By (1.2) and (6.18),
tr ((αx1α)(αx2)(x3α)) = tr ((αx1α)(α(x2x3)α)) = tr (((αx1α)α) ((x2x3)α))

= tr ((((αx1)α)α) ((x2x3)α)) = kαktr ((αx1) ((x2x3)α))
= kαktr (α (αx1) (x2x3)) = kαk2tr (x1(x2x3)) .

So,

det(d1(α)(X)) = kαks1s2s3 +

= kαk det(X).

Therefore, d1(α) belongs to GE6. Moreover, d1(α) belongs to E6 if kαk = 1.

Next, we consider n21(u) (u ∈ O). Let X be as in (1.3). By taking the product of

the ﬁrst two matrices ﬁrst,

One can also verify that changing the order of multiplication does not change the

By deﬁnition,

det(n21(u)(X)) = s1(s2 + tr(ux3) + s1kuk)s3 + tr(((x1 + ux2)x2)(x3 + s1u))

1s3kuk − s1s3tr(x3u).

It is known that for any x, y ∈ O,

(xy)y = xkyk, y(yx) = xkyk.

RATIONAL ORBITS OF THE SPACE OF PAIRS OF EXCEPTIONAL JORDAN ALGEBRAS

37

(see [12, p.8, Lemma 1.3.3]). So, by this and the relations in (1.2),

tr((x1x2)u) = tr(x1(x2u)),
tr(((ux2)x2)x3) = kx2ktr(ux3) = kx2ktr(x3u),
tr(((ux2)x2)u)) = kx2ktr(uu) = 2kx2kkuk.

So all the terms except for det(X) cancel out and we obtain det(n21(u)(X)) =
det(X).
(cid:3)

Note that for X ∈ J and α ∈ O×, the determinant of

(diag(α, 1, 1)X) diag(α, 1, 1)

may not be kαk det(X).

Since GL(3) is generated by elements of the forms d(α1, α2, α3) (α1, α2, α3 ∈ k×),

nij(u) (i 6= j, u ∈ k), the following corollary follows.

Corollary 6.19. For any g1 ∈ GL(3) (resp. g ∈ G), ρ(g1) ∈ G1 (resp. ρ(g) ∈ G).

where si,j ∈ k, xi,j ∈ O for i = 1, 2, j = 1, 2, 3.

Proof. We ﬁrst show that there exists g ∈ G1 such that the (1, 1)-entry of gx1 is

Let W′ be the subgroup of GL(3)k consisting of permutation matrices. Then W′

is isomorphic to S3. Let W = ρ1(W′) ⊂ G1. We put

If there exists 1 ≤ j ≤ 3 such that s1,j

6= 0, then by applying an element of W,
we may assume that s1,1 6= 0. Suppose that all diagonal entries of x1 are 0. Since
x ∈ Vss
6= 0. By applying an element of
W, we may assume that x1,3 6= 0. If u ∈ O, then the (1, 1)-entry of n12(u)(x1) is
tr(ux1,3). Since x1,3 6= 0, there exists u ∈ O such that tr(ux1,3) 6= 0. Therefore, we
may assume that s1,1 6= 0.

38

RYO KATO AND AKIHIKO YUKIE

By applying elements of the forms n21(u), n31(u) (u ∈ O), we may assume that
x1,2 = x1,3 = 0. If s1,2 = s1,3 = x1,1 = 0, then the weights of all non-zero coordi-
nates of x with respect to the one parameter subgroup (which will be abbreviated
as 1PS from now on)

λ : GL(1) ∋ α 7→(cid:16)d(α2, α−1, α−1), diag(α−3, α3)(cid:17) ∈ Gk

is positive (this GL(1) is GL(1) over k). This contradicts to the assumption that
x ∈ Vss
k . This is well-known (see [9, p.49, Theorem 2.1]) but can be seen in this
situation as follows also. If ∆(x) is the relative invariant polynomial of degree 12
as in Introduction, since Im(λ) ⊂ E6 × SL(2), ∆(λ(α)x) = ∆(x). However, since
the weights of all non-zero coordinates with respect to λ are positive, there exists
a polynomial P(x, α) such that ∆(x) = ∆(λ(α)x) = αP(x, α). Since ∆(x) is a non-
zero polynomial which does not depend on α, this is a contradiction.

So (s1,2, s1,3, x1,1) 6= (0, 0, 0). By a similar argument as above, there exists g ∈ G1 k
such that gx1 is in the form diag(s1,1, s1,2, s1,3) where s1,1, s1,2 6= 0. Since det(x1) =
0, s1,3 = 0.

If s2,3 = 0 then the weights of all non-zero coordinates with respect to the 1PS

λ : GL(1) ∋ α 7→(cid:16)d(α2, α2, α−4), diag(α−3, α3)(cid:17)

is positive, which is a contradiction. Therefore, s2,3 6= 0.

Then by applying elements of the forms n31(u), n32(u), we may assume that
x2,1 = x2,2 = 0. Note that n31(u), n32(u) do not change x1. Therefore, x is in the
form:

s1,2

Since the norm map O× → k× is surjective, by applying elements of the forms
d1(α1), d2(α2), d3(α3) (α1, α2, α3 ∈ O×), we may assume that s1,1 = 1/2, s1,2 =

We ﬁrst show that there exists g ∈ Gk such that gx is still in the form (6.26) and

that s2,1 6= 0.

Suppose that s2,1 = 0. If s2,2 6= 0, then we only have to apply an element of
W. So we assume that s2,1 = s2,2 = 0. In this situation, if u ∈ O and tr(u) = 0,
then n12(u)x1 = x1 and the (1, 1)-entry of n12(u)x2 is tr(ux2,3) = tr(x2,3u). Let
x2,3 = a + b where a ∈ k and tr(b) = 0. Then tr(x2,3u) = tr(bu). The assumption
implies that b 6= 0. Suppose that tr(bu) = 0 for all u ∈ O such that tr(u) = 0. Since

RATIONAL ORBITS OF THE SPACE OF PAIRS OF EXCEPTIONAL JORDAN ALGEBRAS

39

tr(bc) = 0 if c ∈ k, tr(bu) = 0 for all u ∈ O. Since O2 ∋ (u1, u2) 7→ tr(u1u2) is
a non-degenerate bilinear form, b = 0, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there
exists u ∈ O such that tr(u) = 0 and that tr(x23u) 6= 0. So we may assume that
s2,1 6= 0.

We next show that there exists g ∈ Gk such that gx is still in the form (6.26) and

that x2,3 ∈ k.
Lemma 6.27. Suppose that s ∈ k× and x ∈ O. Then there exists u ∈ O such that
tr(u) = 0 and x + su ∈ k.

Proof. It is enough to take u = (1/2s)(x − x).

(cid:3)

If tr(u) = 0, then n12(u)x1 = x1 and the (1, 2)-entry of n12(u)x2 is x2,3 + s2,1u.
Since s2,1 6= 0, there exists u such that tr(u) = 0 and x2,3 + s2,1u ∈ k by Lemma

Suppose that Fx(v) has a rational factor. By applying an element of GL(2)k, we
may assume that Fx(1, 0) = 0. Then det(x1) = 0. By Lemma 6.21, we may assume
that x ∈ V ss
k and is in the form (6.22). Then (1, 0, 1), (−1, 0, 1) ∈ ZeroP2(x) are
rational points. Therefore, the element of H1(k, S4) which corresponds to x with
respect to the action of Gk comes from H1(k, S2) and so comes from H1(k, S).

Finally we consider the case where Fx is irreducible. We assume that x1, x2 are in
the form (6.20). By assumption, det(x1) 6= 0. By the same argument as in the proof
of Lemma 6.21, we may assume that x1 is a diagonal matrix. Since det(x1) 6= 0, all
diagonal entries are non-zero. Also since the norm map O× → k× is surjective, we
may assume that x1 = diag( 1

Therefore, A1,23 = A1,32. The conditions A1,12 = A1,21, A1,13 = A1,31 and A1,ii ∈ k
(i = 1, 2, 3) are obvious. Thus B1(u)(Y) ∈ J .

where the order of multiplication does not matter. One can verify by tedious com-
putations using (6.30) that B1(u) = n31(− 1

since O is not associative). Therefore, B1(u) belongs to G1 k.

We successively apply elements of Gk to modify x.
We eventually want to make s2,1 = 0 and kx2,3k 6= 0. However, for that purpose,
we ﬁrst make s2,1 non-zero to eliminate some entries of x2. If s2,1 = 0 and s2,3 6= 0,
then we only have to apply ν (see (6.23)). Note that νx1 = x1. Suppose that s2,1 =

s2,3 = 0. If further x2,3 = 0, then by applying(cid:16) 1

2 s2,2 1(cid:17) ∈ GL(2)k, s2,2 becomes

0. Then det(x2) = 0, which is a contradiction. Therefore, x2,3 6= 0. If we choose
u ∈ O such that kuk = 0, then by applying B2(u) to x2, s2,1 (which is 0 now)
becomes 1

2tr(x2,3u) and x1 does not change.

We can choose a basis of O as a k-vector space so that according to the coordinate
u = (u1, . . . , u8) of u with respect to this basis, kuk = u1u2 + u3u4 + u5u6 + u7u8
(O is split). Since 1
2tr(x2,3u) is a non-zero k-linear function, it is in the form c1u1 +
· · · + c8u8 (c1, . . . , c8 ∈ k). We may assume that c1 6= 0. We choose u2 = 1. Then
kuk = 0 if and only if u1 = −(u3u4 + u5u6 + u7u8) and so

0

1

2

tr(x2,3u) = −c1(u3u4 + u5u6 + u7u8) + c2 + c3u3 + · · · + c8u8.

This is a non-zero polynomial. Since k is an inﬁnite ﬁeld, there exists u ∈ O such
that kuk = 0 and that 1
2tr(x2,3u) 6= 0. Therefore, we may assume that s2,1 6= 0 for
the moment (we later change s2,1 to 0 after eliminating some entries of x2).

By applying an element of the form B1(u) (u ∈ O), x1 does not change and x2,3
changes to x2,3 + s2,1u. Since s2,1 6= 0, there exists u such that x2,3 + s2,1u = 0.
Therefore, we may assume that x2,3 = 0 for the moment (we later change x2,3 so
that kx2,3k 6= 0).

We want to make x2,1 ∈ k while preserving x1 = Λ (see (6.28)). So we prove the

following lemma.

Lemma 6.31. Let y = h(t1, t2, t3, y1, y2, y3) ∈ J where ti ∈ k, yi ∈ O (i = 1, 2, 3). If
ky1k 6= 0, then there exists g ∈ G1Λ k (G1Λ is the stabilizer of Λ in G1) such that the (2, 3)
entry of gy is 1 and g preserves subspaces kEi, Oi (see (2.4) and (2.6)) of J for i = 1, 2, 3.

Proof. We construct such an element g by combining the maps di(β) where β ∈
O×, i = 1, 2. For β ∈ O×,

d1(−kβk)d2(β)(Λ) =

2

2

−β

−2kβk

−β2

 .

If tr(β) = 0, then since β = −β, β2 = β
= −kβk and so d1(−kβk)d2(β)(Λ)
= kβkΛ. Hence, the element kβk−1 I27 d1(−kβk)d2(β) ∈ G1 k ﬁxes Λ for any β ∈
W ∩ O× where W is the the orthogonal complement of k · 1 in O. For β ∈ O×,
we denote the element kβk−1 I27 d1(−kβk)d2(β) ∈ G1 k by D(β). By the above
argument, if tr(β) = 0 (β ∈ W), then D(β) ∈ G1Λ k. Since dj(α) where α ∈ O×, j =
1, 2 preserves subspaces kEi, Oi of J for i = 1, 2, 3, D(β) also preserves these

(d1(−kβk) does not change y1) and so tr(y1) changes to kβk−1tr(y1β).

If there exists β ∈ W ∩ O× such that tr(βy1) = 0, then the (2, 3) entry of

subspaces. By applying D(cid:0) β(cid:1) where β ∈ W ∩ O× to y, y1 changes to kβk−1y1β
D(cid:0)kβk−1y1β(cid:1)(cid:0)D(cid:0)β(cid:1) (y)(cid:1) is
Note that by assumption,(cid:13)(cid:13)y1β(cid:13)(cid:13) 6= 0. Since D(cid:0)kβk−1y1β(cid:1) D(cid:0) β(cid:1) belongs to G1Λ k

and preserves subspaces kEi, Oi of J where i = 1, 2, 3, this element is what we
wanted. So it is enough to show that there exists β ∈ W ∩ O× such that tr(βy1) =
0.

k(kβk−1( y1β ))k−1(kβk−1(y1β))(kβk−1( y1β )) = 1.

For a ∈ O, we denote the linear map O ∋ x → tr(ax) ∈ k by tra and denote
the restriction of tra on W by tra|W. Then dim(Ker(try1|W)) ≥ 6. Since O is split,
the dimension of the maximal totally isotropic subspace, which is called the Witt
index, of O is 4 (= 1
2 dim O). Thus, there exists β ∈ Ker(try1|W) such that kβk 6= 0.
This completes the proof of the lemma.

If u ∈ O and tr(u) = 0, then n31(u) does not change x1 and x2,2 changes to

By applying B1(−2x2,2), we may assume that x2,2 = 0. By applying an element
of the form n31(u) where tr(u) = 0, Lemma 6.27 implies that we may assume that
x2,1 ∈ k. Therefore, x is in the form:

where s2,2, x2,1, s2,3 ∈ k. Then x ∈ V ss
k and ZeroP2(x) has a rational point (1, 0, 0).
Therefore, the element of H1(k, S4) which corresponds to x now comes from an
element of H1(k, S). This completes the proof of Proposition 6.12.

Since Proposition 6.12 is proved, the proof of Theorem 1.19 is ﬁnished now. (cid:3)
