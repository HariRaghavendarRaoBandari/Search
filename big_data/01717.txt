We report extremely large positive magnetoresistance of 1.72 million percent in single crystal
TaSb2 at moderate conditions of 1.5 K and 15 T. The quadratic growth of magnetoresistance (MR
∝ B1.96) is not saturating up to 15 T, a manifestation of nearly perfect compensation with < 0.1%
mismatch between electron and hole pockets in this semimetal. The compensation mechanism
is conﬁrmed by temperature-dependent MR, Hall and thermoelectric coeﬃcients of Nernst and
Seebeck, revealing two pronounced Fermi surface reconstruction processes without spontaneous
symmetry breaking, i.e. Lifshitz transitions, at around 20 K and 60 K, respectively. Using quantum
oscillations of magnetoresistance and magnetic susceptibility, supported by density-functional theory
calculations, we determined that the main hole Fermi surface of TaSb2 forms a unique shoulder
structure along the F − L line. The ﬂat band top of this shoulder pocket is just a few meV above
the Fermi level, leading to the observed topological phase transition at 20 K when the shoulder
pocket disappears. Further increase in temperature pushes the Fermi level to the band top of
the main hole pocket, induced the second Lifshitz transition at 60 K when hole pocket vanishes
completely.

INTRODUCTION

Topological classiﬁcations of materials beyond the con-
ventional band theory is one of the revolutionary ad-
vances in condensed-matter physics, as started by the
discovery of topological
Search-
ing for new archetype of topological materials has in-
trigued enormous research eﬀorts, and has witnessed the
birth of Dirac Semimetals (DSMs)4–6, Weyl semimetals

cal proposals for various topological phases11.

insulators (TIs)1–3.

Intriguingly, many topological semimetals are char-
acterized by extremely large magnetoresistance (XMR).
The linear XMR in DSM Cd3As2 has been attributed
to the lifting of protection mechanism by the external
magnetic ﬁeld6, however, Narayanan et al. argued that
such linear behavior is disorder related12. For the inver-
sion symmetry broken TaAs-family WSMs, XMR is also
non-saturating, but quasi-linear in ﬁeld dependence13–17,
which is explained by electron-hole (e-h) compensation
between the co-existing trivial and WSM pockets13,16,17.
In contrast, similar e-h compensation mechanism leads

is widely accepted to be responsible for the experimen-
tal observation, as supported by angle-resolved photoe-
mission spectroscopy (ARPES)19 and angle-dependent
quantum oscillations20. However, Jiang et al. proposed

that strong spin-orbital coupling plays a non negligi-
ble role in the quadratic XMR using circular polarized
ARPES21, and Rhodes et al.
showed that the Fermi
surface of WTe2 is signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by magnetic
ﬁeld due to the Zeeman coupling22. Very recently, XMR
is also reported in rocksalt structured LaSb23, which is
claimed to be a partially compensated semimetal with
dominant electron concentration of ∼ 1 × 1020 cm−3 at
low temperatures. The XMR of LaSb with high resid-
ual resistivity ratio (RRR > 800) is quadratic-like, but
becomes saturating for lower quality samples23.

Noticeably, Cd3As2, the TaAs series, and WTe2

24 all
have lattice symmetry protected topological nodes in the
bulk, while LaSb may host topological surface states as
a TI candidate with a band gap of 10 meV25.
In the
present study, we report exotic quadratic XMR in mono-
clinic TaSb2, which strictly follows the the B1.96 depen-
dence and reaches an extremely large MR of 1.72 million
percent at 1.5 K and 15 T. Using temperature-dependent
MR, Hall and thermoelectric coeﬃcient measurements,
we found that TaSb2 has perfectly compensated e-h pock-
ets at 1.5 K, with a mismatch between electron density
ne and hole density nh less than 0.1%, in contrast to 4%
in WTe2. By increasing temperatures, TaSb2 undergoes
two subsequent Lifshitz transitions around 20 K and 60
K, respectively. Using temperature-dependent quantum
oscillations and ﬁrst-principle density-functional theory
calculations, we determine the physical origin of these
two topological phase transitions, which are rooted in
the unique shoulder structure of the main hole pocket
along the L − I direction. Our study suggests that the
Fermi surface topology may play an important role in the
XMR phenomena of various topological semimetals.

II. EXPERIMENTAL

Single crystal TaSb2 was synthesized by two-step vapor
transport technique using iodine as the transport agent.
A stoichiometric mixture of high purity powders of Ta
(99.99%) and Sb (99.999%) was thoroughly ground and
pressed into pellets in an argon-ﬁlled glove box. The
pellets were then sealed in an evacuated quartz tube and
heated at 1023 K for 2 days. The resulting polycrystalline
TaSb2 pellets were ground into powder again, and mixed
with iodine (∼13 mg/ml in concentration) in a sealed
quartz tube. Then, the tube was placed in a two-zone
furnace with a temperature gradient of 50 K from 1273
K to 1223 K for 7 days. Shining single crystals with
typical dimensions of 3 mm × 1 mm × 0.5 mm were got
after the furnace was cooled down to room temperature
naturally.

The

crystal

characterized by X-
ray diﬀraction (XRD) using a PANalytical X’Pert

structure was

MRD diﬀractometer with Cu Kα radiation and a
graphite monochromator. The chemical compositions
of Ta:Sb=1:2 were determined by energy dispersion X-
ray spectroscopy (EDX), showing no iodine residual in
the single crystals. All electric transport measurements
were carried out in an Oxford-15T cryostat with a He4
probe in the standard four-point contact or Hall-bar con-
ﬁgurations, using Keithley 2400 source-measure meters
and 2182A nanovoltmeters. The thermoelectric proper-
ties were measured by the steady-state technique. The
magnetic ﬁeld was applied along the c axis while a tem-
perature gradient about 0.5 K/mm was applied along the
b axis. The temperature diﬀerences were determined by
the diﬀerential method using a pair of type E thermo-
couples.

The density-functional

theory (DFT) calculations
were carried out using the projector augmented wave
method26, as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simula-
tion package (VASP)27,28. The exchange-correlation po-

generalized gradient approximation (GGA) developed by
Perdew and Wang29. The plane-wave cutoﬀ energy was
set to be 400 eV and k-point sampling based on the
Monkhorst-Pack scheme30 was performed to ensure that
the total energy is converged within 0.002 eV per unit-
cell. The structures were optimized until the remanent
Hellmann-Feynman force on each ion is less than 0.01
eV/˚A.

III. RESULTS

Figure 1a shows the crystal structure of TaSb2, which
is monoclinic with the space group of C12/m1 (No. 12).
The upper panel of Fig. 1a highlights the mirror symme-
try, while the bottom panel clearly shows the inversion
symmetry of the lattice. The XRD patterns indicate the
high quality of our TaSb2 single crystals, which shows
the dominant [003] peak with very narrow full width at
half maximum, and no splitting of peaks. The lattice pa-
rameters extracted from powder XRD are a = 10.225(1)
˚A, b = 3.646(1) ˚A and c = 8.295(1) ˚A respectively. With
zero magnetic ﬁeld (B), the resistivity (ρxx) of TaSb2 is
metallic (the black line in Fig. 1c). Once B is applied
along the c axis, i.e. the [001] direction, TaSb2 changes
from metallic to insulating behavior at a temperature
turning point (T ∗), which is deﬁned as the resistivity
minimum. T ∗ grows linearly as a function of B setpoint
with a slope of 6.4 K/T, which is signiﬁcantly higher than
18. Like many other topologi-
4.4 K/T reported in WTe2
cal semimetals, the XMR growth in TaSb2 is very sensi-
tive to RRR. As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 1d, for
sample 1 (S1) with RRR=530, the quadratic growth is
nearly ideal with m=1.96 in the logarithmic plot of MR
vs Bm. For sample 2 (S2) with lower RRR=320, m is re-
duced to 1.9. Similar to WTe2, the XMR of TaSb2 shows
a characteristic “activation” ﬁeld of 0.1 T, below which m
is smaller than 1. Despite the diﬀerence in m, the XMR
growth in both samples does not show any tangible de-
viation from Bm. This is in contrast with WTe2, which
shows decreasing m when B exceeding 12 T, even for
the highest quality samples with RRR > 120018,20. The
faster growth in T∗ together with the non-saturating m
in TaSb2 produce an extraordinary XMR of 1.72 million
percent at 1.5 K and 15 T, among the highest records
in reported literatures16–18,23. As a direct comparison
of resonant compensated semimetals, WTe2 has 4% mis-
20, thus, the even higher XMR
match between ne and nh
with constant m imply an even higher degree of resonant
e-h compensation in TaSb2.

To get insight into the XMR mechanism, we have stud-
ied the temperature(T )-dependent ρxx(B) of TaSb2. As
summarized in Figure 2, below 60 K, the ¯µB1.96 behavior
of S2 is strictly reproduced at high B, although the XMR
coeﬃcient ¯µ decreases and the “activation” ﬁeld increases
when the sample is warmed up. The trend is more re-
vealing using the logarithmic plot of the ρxx(B) curves,

3

which clearly shows the deviation of ρxx(B) from B1.96
when T exceeds 60 K. Such a transition is also mani-
fested in Hall signals, but with a distinct transition T of
20 K. As shown in Fig. 2c, below 20 K, ρxy(B) shows
pronounced sign reversal from negative to positive. Us-
ing the two-band model31, we found that the “U”-shaped
ρxy(B) at 1.5 K is due to nearly perfect compensation of
ne = 4.627 × 1019 cm−3 and nh = 4.628 × 1019 cm−3
(< 0.1% mismatch), while the diﬀerence between µe
and µh (∼ 10%) only plays a minor role in determining
the curve shape [see the Supplemental Information (SI)].
Such high-precision resonant compensation persists up to
18.6 K. However, once T crosses the critical point of 20 K,
the Hall signals become linear with a negative coeﬃcient
over the whole ﬁeld range, which makes the two-band
analysis rather tricky and subjective.
It is noteworthy
that, below 2 T, the ρxy(B) curves are all linear with neg-
ative Hall coeﬃcients, indicating the dominance of elec-
tron carriers even in the compensation regime. Thus, by
assuming a single band conduction over the whole tem-
perature range, we can extract important informations
on the emergence of hole pockets and the resonant com-
pensation, both eﬀectively reducing the negative slope of
ρxy(B).
Indeed, we have observed two transition tem-
peratures of ∼ 60 K and ∼ 20 K, respectively in the
single-band Hall coeﬃcient RH (Fig. 2d).

To understand the discrepancy in transition temper-
atures as inferred diﬀerently by T -dependent ρxx(B)
and ρxy(B) respectively, we turn to thermoelectric co-
eﬃcients of Seebeck and Nernst eﬀect, which provide in-
dispensable information in understanding resonant com-
pensated systems20. For WTe2, Wu et al also shows that
the T driven deviation from resonant compensation is
essentially a continuous Lifshitz transition32. Such topo-
logical Fermi surface reconstruction induces an anomaly
in the Seebeck coeﬃcient, close to the transition point32.
In Figure 3a, we show the T -dependent Seebeck coef-
ﬁcient [Sxx(T )], which switches the sign from negative
to positive at around 205 K, an indication of the emer-
gence of hole pocket at low temperatures. By taking the
derivative of Sxx(T ), we can clearly see a local maxi-
mum at 20 K, agreeing with the Hall results. In Ref.32,
the Lifshitz transition is deﬁned as the turning point in
the slope of dSxx(T )/dT , representing the temperature
where the hole pocket disappear completely32. In TaSb2,
we can ﬁnd the same type of slope turning point at 60
K, consistent with the transition temperature suggested
by the resistivity curves. The existence of a second Lif-
shitz transition at 60 K implies that the topological phase
transition at 20 K does not lead to the vanish of the hole
populations. Indeed, above 20 K, the hole pocket is still
comparable to the electron one, as the linear dependence
of Nernst (Sxy) on magnetic ﬁeld20 is evident at 47.5 K.
Using T-dependent Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) and
magnetic susceptibility oscillations, combined with DFT
calculations, we found that the transition at 20 K is
rooted in the unique electronic structure of TaSb2, which
has a shallow shoulder pocket in the vicinity of the main

hole pocket. Temperature change ﬁrst drives the Fermi
energy across the band top of the shoulder pocket, lead-
ing to the ﬁrst Lifshitz transition at 20 K. Further tem-
perature increase gradually move the Fermi energy to the
band top of the main hole pocket, where the second Lif-
shitz transition occurs due to the vanishing of hole Fermi
surface.

As shown in Figure 4, the SdH oscillations of TaAs2 are
characterized by three prominent frequencies of α = 55
T, β = 234 T, and γ = 487 T, respectively. The re-
sults have been conﬁrmed by the magnetic susceptibility
oscillations, i.e. the de Haas-van Alphen eﬀect (see SI).
By ﬁtting the Lifshitz-Kosevich (LK) formula for 3D sys-
tems to T-dependent FFT amplitudes22, we can extract
the eﬀective mass m∗ for all three pockets, which are
m∗
α = 0.24me, m∗
γ = 0.29me, respec-
tively (Fig. 4b). By comparing the FFT peaks with the
DFT results, we assign β to the e pocket and γ to the
h pocket, respectively. At the ﬁrst glance, the large dif-
ference between β and γ is contradicting with the claim

β = 0.33me and m∗

of ideal e-h compensation in TaSb2. However, DFT indi-
cates the existence of two electron pockets along the I−L
lines, while there are only one large hole pocket enclosing
the symmetry points of F1, Y and F in the ﬁrst Brillouin
zone (Fig. 4c and Fig. 4d). Uniquely, each main hole
pocket has a much smaller shoulder pocket, which is lo-
cated along the F − L line and has its band top very
close to the Fermi surface (∼9 meV). DFT calculations
indicate such shallow shoulder pocket is created by the
SOC induced gap opening of the crossed bands of Ta-5dxy
and Ta-5dx2+y2. In the absence of SOC, there are two
band crossing points along the I − L direction (Inset of
Fig. 4c). Unlike the previously reported TIs3, these two
band crossing points in TaSb2 are inequivalent in energy,
which leads to the formation of the unconventional shoul-
der structure once SOC is turned on. As shown in the
right panel of the inset, signiﬁcant bandgap of 0.45 eV is
opened by SOC at both crossing points, making TaSb2
a topological semimetal with the topological invariant
Z2=[0;(111)]. Fig. 4d shows the three-dimensional (3D)

DISCUSSION

5

We now discuss the possible mechanisms for the un-
precedented XMR of TaSb2. First, by selecting diﬀerent
FFT windows of the SdH oscillations, we did not see
tangible frequency shift in all three peaks. Moreover, the
Bm growth in XMR starts at 0.1 T and retains the same
m up to 15 T. Thus, we may conclude that the Zeeman
eﬀect only contributes marginally to the XMR. Recently,
Tafti et al suggest that the XMR in LaSb is correlated
to the topological surface states and the breaking of time
reversal symmetry by the external ﬁeld23. TaSb2 indeed
shares some common features with LaSb in the existence
of a TI gap in the bulk and the coexistence of trivial e
and h pockets. However, considering the quite large triv-
ial pockets (ne, nh > 1019 cm−3) and the sensitivity of
XMR to RRR, it is unlikely that the topological surface
state is dominating the experimental observations.

Our results again testify the importance of resonant
e-h compensation in the extraordinary XMR phenom-
ena of emergent topological semimetals. Noteworthy, the
fast degradation of MR above 20 K is coincident with
the disappearance of the small shoulder pocket, despite
that TaSb2 remains well compensated as indicated by
the Nernst results. Considering that the shoulder pocket
contributes only 1% extra holes to the overall hole den-
sity (See SI), there may be new mechanism, such as
Fermi surface topology, playing a critical role in the XMR
phenomena of TaSb2. Indeed, the Fermi surface of the
hole pocket in TaSb2 is rather unconventional, showing
not only the shallow shoulder pocket but also a double-
saddleback structure near the F1 points (See SI). This
will require further experimental investigations and the-
oretical modelling.

In summary, the TaSb2 family represent a unique class
of topological semimetals, which have the Fermi level
well above the SOC-induced TI bandgap and the in-
verted bands become parts of the Fermi surface. It would
be interesting to investigate and compare the XMR and
topological phase transition phenomena in other TaSb2-
family compounds, such as TaAs2 and NbAs2. For such
resonant compensated semimetals, pressure may also
lead to the suppression of hole pockets and the emer-
gence of superconductivity, as reported in WTe2

33,34.
