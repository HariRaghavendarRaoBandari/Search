We investigate how conﬁning a transverse spatial dimension inﬂuences the few- and many-body
properties of non-relativistic bosons with pointlike interactions. Our main focus is on the dimensional
crossover from three to two dimensions, which is of relevance for ultracold atom experiments. Using
Functional Renormalization Group equations and T-matrix calculations we study how the phase
transition temperature changes as a function of the spatial extent of the transverse dimension and
relate the 3D and 2D s-wave scattering lengths. The analysis reveals how the properties of the
lower-dimensional system are inherited from the higher-dimensional one during the renormalization
group evolution. We limit the discussion to conﬁnements in a potential well with periodic boundary
conditions and argue why this qualitatively captures the physics of other compactiﬁcations such as
transverse harmonic conﬁnement as in cold atom experiments.

INTRODUCTION

Lower-dimensional systems play a prominent role in
statistical and condensed matter physics as they exhibit
several unusual features due to the pronounced inﬂuence
of ﬂuctuations. At the same time, many technologically
interesting materials such as high-temperature supercon-
ductors or graphene are based on layered or striped crys-
talline structures and thus inherit part of their proper-
ties from the reduced dimensionality. To disentangle the
inﬂuence of dimensionality eﬀects from other aspects of
the many-body system constitutes a key challenge in ad-
vancing our understanding of condensed matter and in
devising new promising materials.

With the recent progress in trapping ultracold quan-
tum gases it has become feasible to simulate lower-
dimensional Hamiltonians by means of atoms in strongly
anisotropic external potentials [1, 2]. For instance, in
2D, the algebraically correlated superﬂuid and the cor-
responding Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless phase tran-
sition have been observed for both bosons [3–8] and
fermion pairs [9, 10]. A characteristic of these types of
experiments is that the ﬁnal setup might, due to an in-
suﬃcient degree of anisotropy of the trap in comparison
to the density of the system, still feature aspects of the
3D system. This anisotropy may be quantiﬁed by the
relative spacing of energy levels for excitations related to
diﬀerent spatial directions, or by aspect ratios of trapping
frequencies in diﬀerent directions. For a ﬁnite anisotropy
ratio, the system is, in general, in a dimensional crossover
without a well-deﬁned dimensionality. Whereas this is
typically an unwanted eﬀect in the quantum simulation
of 2D and 1D Hamiltonians, it can also be seen as a pos-
sibility to implement new types of quantum matter with
interesting properties. The aim of this paper is to investi-
gate the few- and many-body properties of a particularly
simple system, the Bose gas with pointlike interactions,
in the dimensional crossover.

Consider for simplicity the crossover from 3D to 2D

by means of compactifying the “transverse” z-direction.
However, the following argumentation is not limited to
this particular case. As a particularly instructive trans-
verse conﬁnement, we delimit the z-direction by a poten-
tial well of length L. The boundary conditions at the
end points may be chosen periodic, in which case we also
say that the system is conﬁned to a torus in z-direction.
We may also restrict the system to a box potential with
inﬁnitely high walls given by

(cid:40)

Vbox(z) =

0 ≤ z ≤ L

0
∞ else

.

(1)

In both cases, the trapping potential inside the well van-
ishes, and thus the conﬁnement reduces to boundary con-
ditions on the bosonic ﬁeld φ(τ, (cid:126)x), or, equivalently, the
coordinates of the many-body wave function in a ﬁrst-
quantized formulation. These boundary conditions read

φ(τ, x, y, z = 0) = φ(τ, x, y, z = L)

(2)

for periodic boundary conditions (pbc) and

φ(τ, x, y, z = 0) = φ(τ, x, y, z = L) = 0

(3)

for the box. The boundary conditions lead to a quantiza-
tion of energies and thus a discrete excitation spectrum
in z-direction.

In a functional integral formulation of the many-body
quantum system, the boundary conditions appear as re-
strictions on the appropriate function space. This can
be related to energy levels of non-interacting excitations,
and eigenstates of the interacting system are not needed
for this purpose.
In our setting the eigenfunctions in
z-direction are superpositions of plane waves with mo-
mentum component qz and the boundary conditions (2)
and (3) lead to a quantization of energies Ez = 2q2
z /2M .
For the torus we have qz → kn with

Our formulation bears much resemblance to other sys-
tems where “dimensional reduction” occurs. This con-
cerns, for example, the transition from eﬀective quan-
tum statistics to classical statistics as the temperature T
drops below the relevant energy scales of the system. In
the Matsubara formalism, 1/T plays the same role as L
in our case. Another example is dimensional reduction of
higher-dimensional Kaluza–Klein theories compactiﬁed
on a torus. The main diﬀerence to systems in relativis-
tic quantum ﬁeld theory is the diﬀerent non-relativistic
dispersion relation in our setting.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we in-
troduce the Bose gas in the dimensional crossover.
In
Sec. III we study the superﬂuid phase transition in the
crossover from 3D to 2D by means of the Functional
Renormalization Group (FRG). The scattering proper-
ties in the 2D limit are studied with the FRG and T-
matrix calculations in Sec. IV. In Sec. V we discuss the
relevance of our calculations for more realistic conﬁne-
ments and give an outlook on extensions of our approach.
In Apps. A 1 and A 2 we study the behavior of the crit-
ical temperature in the 2D limit, and in Apps. B and
C we derive the FRG ﬂow equation in the dimensional
crossover in detail and relate T-matrix, scattering vertex,
and dimer propagator within the FRG framework.

II. MODEL

We study non-relativistic bosons with repulsive point-
like interactions. This provides an excellent description
for ultracold quantum gases of Alkali atoms, where the
precise form of interatomic interactions is irrelevant for
the macroscopic physics and can thus be replaced by a
pointlike s-wave coupling constant λΛ, which eventually
relates to an experimentally measurable scattering length
a. The model may, however, also be used as an eﬀective
description for non-relativistic bosonic degrees of freedom
in other condensed matter setups.

a torus of circumference β = (kBT )−1 with temperature

The few- and many-body properties of the system de-
scribed by the action (5) are captured by the partition
function of the system. Equivalently, this information is
encoded in the eﬀective action or free energy Γ[φ; µ, T, λ],
which is a functional of the mean ﬁeld φ(x) = (cid:104)ϕ(x)(cid:105) in

FIG. 1: Schematics of the energy spectrum in the dimen-
sional crossover from 3D to 2D. The ﬁrst two panels show
the discrete eigenenergies for a noninteracting system in a
3D box potential which conﬁnes the system to the cuboid
(x, y, z) ∈ [0, Lx]2 × [0, L].
In (a) we have set Lx/L = 2,
whereas (b) displays the case of Lx/L = 3. As we increase
the ratio Lx/L, an eﬀective 2D continuum of states (thin gray
lines) ﬁlls the region between the discrete spectrum of excita-
tions in the transverse z-direction (thick red lines). The lowest
excitations appear above the zero-point energy, which is gen-
erally not zero. In (c) we sketch the more realistic scenario of
a system which is interacting and conﬁned by a smooth trap-
ping potential. Although the concrete mode spectrum and
level spacing in (c) diﬀer from (a) and (b), we ﬁnd the same
qualitative behavior.

whereas in a box we have Ez → 2κ2
n/(2M ) with κn =
πn
L , n = 1, 2, . . . Importantly, the box features a nonva-
nishing zero-point energy, E0, whereas a trap with pbc
does not. Since realistic conﬁnements such as they ap-
pear in cold atom experiments are implemented by means
of smoothly varying trapping potentials and not poten-
tial wells, our analysis can only reveal qualitative state-
ments. For example, in case of a harmonic trap the func-
tion space consists of Hermite functions, again with a
discrete energy spectrum. For an increasing anisotropy
the level spacing in the x- and y-directions goes to zero
as compared to the one in the z-direction. We visualize
the previous statements in Fig. 1.

In our setting we need to compare L with the length
scales associated to the many-body physics such as den-
sity and temperature. The regime where L is much
smaller than all those length scales is called the 2D limit,
because the system will be in its ground state in the
z-direction and the low-energy excitations are limited
to the two-dimensional continuum (qx, qy) in momentum
space just above the zero-point energy E0. The 3D sys-
tem then macroscopically looks like a 2D system. In our
analysis below we also address the question how the pa-
rameters of the eﬀective 2D system are inherited from
the 3D system.

the following we employ the Functional Renormalization

Rk is a regulator function, which can be chosen freely
within some limitations [22].

[23–25]. Our main in-

terest is in the eﬀective potential Uk that we evaluate
here for a homogeneous ﬁeld φ. This is well suited for
periodic boundary conditions, while for the box a ﬁeld
φ(z) ∼ sin(πz/L) should improve the approximation. (In
principle, one could include diﬀerent potentials for sev-
eral of the low lying modes in the z-direction.) For the
present analysis it is suﬃcient to employ a φ4-expansion
for the eﬀective average potential Uk(ρ) according to

Uk(ρ) = m2

ρ2,

(8)

with U(1)-invariant ρ = φ∗φ. In Eq. (7) we use a renor-
malized ﬁeld φ chosen such that the prefactor of φ∗∇2φ
is unity. This explains why the expectation value of φ
can be nonzero even in the 2D-limit, where the Mermin–
Wagner theorem [26, 27] forbids long-range order (LRO).
We denote the k-dependent minimum of Uk(ρ) by ρ0,k.
The normal and superﬂuid phase of the system are dis-
tinguished by means of ρ0,k→0 being zero or nonzero,
respectively. The ansatz in Eq.
(8) has been success-
fully applied to describe the universal and non-universal
features of the non-relativistic Bose gas in both 3D and
2D. In particular, the thermodynamic equation of state
[28, 29], critical exponents [13, 30], and critical tempera-
ture Tc [25, 29] have been obtained in good quantitative
agreement with other theoretical approaches [31–34] and
with experiment [35–37]. Extension of the ansatz (8) for
Γk of the 2D Bose gas have been devised in Refs. [38–40]
to capture, for instance, the emergence of Popov’s hy-
drodynamic description at low energies and the essential
scaling at the BKT transition.

Given the success of the ansatz (8) to provide a quali-
tative and mostly quantitative correct description of the
3D and 2D non-relativistic Bose gas, it is natural to apply
it to the question of the dimensional crossover from 3D
to 2D. For spatial dimensions 2 < d ≤ 3, the system fea-
tures LRO below the critical temperature Tc. For d = 2,
a superﬂuid phase with power-law decay of correlations

3

and nonzero superﬂuid density ρ0,k→0 exists below a crit-
ical temperature Tc [41–44]. Investigating the location of
the minimum ρ0,k of the eﬀective average potential in the
limit k → 0 thus allows for a uniﬁed description of the
superﬂuid transition for all 2 ≤ d ≤ 3.

It is instructive to study the role of ρ0 in the dimen-
sional crossover in terms of the eﬀective action. For this
consider the 3D eﬀective action ansatz

The FRG approach has been applied to study the eﬀect
of compactiﬁed dimensions on many-body system both in
several relativistic and non-relativistic setups. Finite vol-
ume eﬀects, i.e., when all spatial directions are conﬁned
to a cube of size [0, L]d, have been studied for quark-
meson-models [45–48] and the 3D BCS-BEC crossover
[49]. In particular, Ref.
[48] highlights the diﬀerence in
periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions. The lat-
ter result in a nonvanishing zero-point energy similar to
the conﬁnement in a box potential discussed above. In
Section V we discuss the role of the zero-point energy
played in the FRG setup on the basis of our ﬁndings for
the dimensional crossover.

III. SUPERFLUID TRANSITION

The ﬂow of the eﬀective average action Γk is initialized
at some ultraviolet momentum scale k = Λ, where ΓΛ
coincides with the microscopic action (5) of a 3D Bose
gas. The compactiﬁcation in z-direction introduces a new
scale to the 3D system, which is deﬁned by the size L
of the potential well. In particular, note that if L−1 is
much larger than the many-body scales, the system is
eﬀectively two-dimensional. We examine this scenario in
Sec. IV. However, the UV scale Λ is always chosen in a
way that Λ (cid:29) (L−1, µ1/2, T 1/2), i.e., we start with a 3D
system with 3D coupling constants. The initial value for
the eﬀective potential is given by

UΛ(ρ) =

(ρ − ρ0,Λ)2

λΛ
2

(14)

√
with ρ0,Λ = µ/λΛ. In practice, we initialize the ﬂow at
µ = 103, and stop at the ﬁnal scale
the UV scale Λ/
kf = Λe−10, which is much smaller than the many body
scales.

The ﬂow equation of the eﬀective average potential Uk
factorizes into a universal L-independent part G1(T ) and
a crossover function F ( ˜L) according to

a derivative with respect to ρ. Further, η constitutes
the k-dependent anomalous dimension associated with
ﬁeld rescaling. For a detailed derivation of Eq. (15) see
Appendix B.

The inﬂuence of the trap is encoded in the crossover

FIG. 2: The crossover function F ( ˜L) modiﬁes the ﬂow equa-
tions of the 3D system. For small ˜L = Lk it diverges like
˜L−1 and the 2D ﬂow equations are recovered. For large
˜L it approaches a constant and the system behaves three-
dimensional. In the FRG approach we start at an ultraviolet
scale kΛ = Λ with LΛ (cid:29) 1, so that the description of the
microscopic theory is three-dimensional.

L to the 2D behavior for k < 2π

We plot the crossover function for pbc in Fig. 2. One
observes a rather sharp transition from the 3D behavior
for k > 2π
L . The oscilla-
tory behavior in the transition region is rapidly damped.
The ﬂow equation for the dashed lines corresponds pre-
cisely to the ﬂow in 3D or 2D with the same truncation.
Dimensional reduction is very eﬀectively realized by the
ﬂow with a reasonable approximation simply switching
from 3D to 2D as k decreases below 2π/L. A similar
sharp transition has been observed in the τ -direction for
the transition between quantum and classical statistics
[50, 51].
From Eq. (15), the ﬂow equations of U(cid:48)
k(ρ0) and λk =
U(cid:48)(cid:48)
k (ρ0) follow by simple diﬀerentiation with respect to ρ.
The ﬂow of the location of the minimum ρ0,k is obtained
by

By following the ﬂow of ρ0,k for k → 0 we deduce whether
ρ0,0 > 0 (superﬂuid phase) or ρ0,0 = 0 (disordered
phase). This allows us to extract the superﬂuid tran-
sition temperature Tc for all trap sizes L. We determine
the density by a suitable ﬂow equation, see Ref. [24].

We plot the superﬂuid fraction ρ0/n for diﬀerent values
of L in Fig. 3. Note that even for a 2D system the ratio
ρ0/n of the 3D quantities ρ0 and n gives the superﬂuid
0 |L→0 and n2D = Ln3D|L→0, so
fraction, since ρ2D
that L drops out. For vanishing temperature the whole
gas becomes superﬂuid irrespective of L, and develops a
small condensate depletion due to interactions [24].

0 = Lρ3D

In Fig. 4 we show the superﬂuid transition tempera-
ture Tc for the whole 2D–3D dimensional crossover. For
large L, Tc approaches the Bose–Einstein condensation

in units of the chemical potential µ, is higher in more 3D-like
systems. For all compactiﬁcation lengths L we recover the
correct limit ρ0/n|T→0 = 1, where the whole gas is super-
ﬂuid due to Galilean invariance. The curves correspond to a

FIG. 4: Dimensional crossover of the superﬂuid critical tem-
perature Tc from 2D to 3D. For large L the superﬂuid transi-
tion goes along with Bose–Einstein condensation. The tran-
sition temperature is substantially lower in a smaller system,
i.e., when L is smaller. For the crossover we ﬁx the 3D cou-
pling constant to the same value as in Fig. 3. In experiments
with ultracold atoms, g3D is usually controlled by a magnetic
Feshbach resonance.

see Eq. (42). Hence, as we decrease L in this regime, we
simulate a whole class of strongly-interacting 2D Bose
gases, each corresponding to a certain coupling λ2D(L)
and critical temperature Tc(L). Consequently, Tc does
not fully saturate for small L, as can be seen in Fig. 4,
although the dependence becomes weak.

In cold atom experiments, the 2D coupling strength
is commonly expressed by the coupling constant ˜g =
(M/2)g2D = g2D/2. Due to the logarithmic energy de-
pendence of the T-matrix in 2D, the coupling g2D needs
to be deﬁned with respect to a ﬁxed energy or momen-
tum scale (in contrast to a2D). On the other hand, as this
scale dependence is only logarithmic, ˜g appears to be ef-
fectively constant in experiments. One convenient choice
consists in deﬁning the coupling at the momentum scale
kn =
n2D related to the 2D density n2D = Ln3D. For
studying the phase transition, T > µ sets the appropriate
scale and thus for a true 2D system we deﬁne

√

g2D = 2˜g = λ2D,k=

√

T

(24)

in the FRG approach. Another convenient choice consists
in identifying the expression in Eq. (23) with g2D.

For a true 2D system with small ˜g, the critical phase
space density for the BKT transition is nλ2
T = log(ξ/˜g),
where λ2
T . Monte Carlo calculations yield
ξ = 380 [31, 32]. Hence the 2D critical temperature reads

T = 2π2

TBKT =

.

(25)

The interaction induced shift of the critical temperature
[52, 53] for suﬃciently small gas parameter a3Dn1/3 reads

∆Tc
Tc,id

= κ a3Dn1/3.

(21)

Within our calculation we have κ = 2.1 [24], which com-
pares well with the Monte Carlo result [54–56]. In our
setup we deﬁne g3D by

g3D = 8πa3D = λ3D,k→0.

(22)

√

In terms of the chemical potential we ﬁnd Tc/µ = 51 for
g3D
µ = 0.025, which corresponds to µc = 1.9g3Dn at
the transition. Note that Hartree–Fock theory predicts
µ = 2g3Dn above the transition temperature.

As L is lowered towards the 2D case, the critical tem-
perature decreases and is reduced by a substantial factor
as one goes through the crossover. Here we perform the
dimensional crossover for a ﬁxed value of a3D = g3D/(8π),
since this quantity is typically ﬁxed by the magnetic ﬁeld
in cold atom experiments. This, in turn, ﬁxes the initial
3D coupling λ3D
Λ through Eq. (35), and leads to a char-
acteristic behavior of Tc in the 2D limit of small L. For
this note that for L (cid:38) Λ−1 the ﬂow in Eq. (15) is solely
determined by F ( ˜L) (cid:39) ˜L−1(1 − η
4 ), and thus resembles
a truly 2D RG ﬂow.
In particular, this applies to the
initial value of the coupling which for L → 0 is given by

Here A = 1 and ξµ = 13.2 from Monte Carlo computa-

depend on the value of kf introduced in the beginning of
this section, see the discussion in Ref. [25] and Appendix
A 1. For the choice of kf applied here we ﬁnd A (cid:39) 1 and
ξµ (cid:39) 6.

For experiments with ultracold 2D gases it might be
relevant that a ﬁnite extension in the z-direction leads to
an enhanced superﬂuid transition temperature. Depend-
ing on the system this inﬂuence can be quite substantial.
For a related study in the context of BCS-superﬂuidity of
two-component fermions see Ref. [57], where an enhance-
ment of the critical temperature in a quasi-2D geometry
has been found. Furthermore, since in 3D we also have a
macroscopic occupation of the lowest energy state, that
is a condensate, there might still be some residual con-
densate for small yet ﬁnite L and nonvanishing temper-
atures.

To investigate the question whether the partial inﬂu-
ence of the third dimension inﬂuences the critical tem-
perature of a (supposed to be) 2D system, we perform
the dimensional crossover for a ﬁxed value of a2D. Note
that this is in contrast to the data shown in Figs. 3 and
4, where a3D is kept ﬁxed. In App. A 1 we provide a dis-
cussion of the dimensional crossover of Tc/µ for small L
and ﬁxed a2D. We ﬁnd that for suﬃciently small L/a2D,
the critical temperature coincides with that of the true
2D system, and is then enhanced for larger values of L.

IV. 2D LIMIT

A. Eﬀective 2D coupling constant

√

√

µ and

We have seen that the ﬂow of couplings can be de-
scribed by a 2D ﬂow whenever the scale k is below an
eﬀective cutoﬀ Λeﬀ (cid:28) L−1. In particular, if L−1 is much
larger than the many-body scales
T , the many-
body system can be described by an eﬀective 2D model
with UV-cutoﬀ Λeﬀ . We call this scenario the 2D limit.
The aim of this section is to relate λ2D(Λeﬀ ) of the eﬀec-
tive 2D action to the 3D scattering length. By integrating
the ﬂow equations between Λ and Λeﬀ in vacuum, we ob-
tain the relation between a2D and a3D, which depends on
the particular compactiﬁcation or trap potential. Once
the renormalized coupling λ2D(Λeﬀ ) is speciﬁed, it allows
to universally determine the many-body properties of the
eﬀective 2D system, and no further knowledge of the 3D
system is required.

In terms of the ﬂow equation (15), the 2D limit mani-
fests itself in the fact that the prefactor F ( ˜L) approaches
the regime ˜L = Lk (cid:28) 1 much earlier than any of the

6

many-body scales is resolved. We introduce the momen-
tum scale Λeﬀ via

µ,

T .

(27)

The scale Λeﬀ is arbitrary within these constraints and
serves as an UV-cutoﬀ of the eﬀective 2D theory.
In the following we consider the regime k ∈ [Λeﬀ , Λ] of
the RG ﬂow. It is characterized by Zk = 1, η = ρ0,k =
NB = 0, leading to a simple form of Eq.
(15), which
reads

where the dot denotes a derivative with respect to t =
log(k/Λ). The crossover function F|η=0 = F0 is evalu-
ated for η = 0, see Eq. (B33) for pbc. In particular, for
˜L (cid:28) 1 we are left with

and approaches these limits suﬃciently fast in the vari-

B. T-matrix

The scattering properties of bosons in the dimensional
crossover are naturally included in the FRG ﬂow equa-
tions in the limit of vanishing density and temperature.
Here we compare and benchmark our ﬁndings with the
quantum mechanical T-matrix approach to low-energy
scattering, where the particle-particle loop is integrated
directly without the use of a ﬂow equation. In App. C
we give a detailed discussion of the interrelation of both
approaches, and limit this presentation to the main re-
sults. The fact that the ﬂow equation for the T-matrix
in vacuum can be solved exactly is related to a decou-
pling property of the two-body sector in this particular
system; see Ref. [60] for an extensive analysis.

For computing the T-matrix we utilize a sharp momen-
tum cutoﬀ which equips the momentum integration with
a UV cutoﬀ scale Λ. This regularization diﬀers from the
use of the regulator Rk(Q) in Eq. (B7). We make this
explicit by a subscript (sh) to the microscopic coupling,
λ(sh)
Λ . One result of the analysis in App. C is to relate
λ(sh)
to λΛ, the latter being used in the FRG analysis in
Λ
Eqs. (35) and (36). Note at this point that it is diﬃcult
to obtain the additional term + 1
8π in Eq. (36) without
computing the energy-dependence of the T-matrix.

The low-energy T-matrix T (E) in d noncompact di-

mensions is deﬁned as

V. DISCUSSION

8

In this work we have studied the dimensional crossover
of non-relativistic bosons when conﬁning a transverse
spatial dimension. Although the derived set of ﬂow equa-
tions is applicable to crossovers from (d + 1) to d dimen-
sions, our main focus has been on the crossover from 3D
to 2D. The motivation for this is the intriguing nature
of the superﬂuid transition in this case and the consid-
erable number of recent cold atom experiments on this
topic. Especially, we wish to contribute to a few open
theoretical challenges in the interpretation of the data of
these as outlined below.

The present approach may, however, be extended
to describe further dimensional crossovers in condensed
matter systems. Compactiﬁcations from 2D to 1D, or
3D to 1D, are highly exciting from the point of view of
quantum phase transitions.
Indeed, phases with quasi
long range order may survive in 1D at zero temperature
and are conceptually close to the ﬁnite temperature su-
perﬂuid phase in the 2D Bose gas, see for instance Ref.
[23] for an FRG perspective on this aspect. Since the
conﬁnement only aﬀects spatial momenta, the character-
istic frequency dependence which governs quantum criti-
cal phenomena will be resolved correctly with the FRG in
the dimensional crossover if this is the case for the system
without compact dimensions. The nature of inhomoge-
neous phases of fermion pairs in the crossover from 3D
to 1D has been discussed in Ref. [62].

As an eﬀective description of bosonic degrees of free-
dom, the ﬁnite temperature 2D Bose gas and its BKT
transition may also be applied to the pseudogap phase of
underdoped cuprates [63]. The inherent non-relativistic
nature of complex bosonic degrees of freedom is also
found in open or non-equilibrium quantum systems such
as exciton-polariton condensates in semiconductor micro-
cavities [64, 65]. The Keldysh ﬁeld theory techniques re-
quired to describe such systems can be incorporated into
the FRG framework, see Ref. [66] for an introduction.

In our analysis of the superﬂuid phase transition we
have performed the dimensional crossover in two variants:
for ﬁxed a3D and for ﬁxed a2D. Each procedure addresses
a somewhat diﬀerent question. When ﬁxing a3D we fol-
low the typical cold atom experimental protocol of setting
the value of a3D by means of an external magnetic ﬁeld B
and then decreasing the length L to eventually arrive at
a 2D system. Importantly, the size of L is typically not
easily tunable in experiment but rather ﬁxed to a par-
ticular value. We can then reach a large class of values
for a2D by means of formula (39) by changing a3D(B).
√
In view of Fig. 4, where g3D
µ = 0.025, one experiment
corresponds to one certain point L
µ on the abscissa.
Through Eq. (23) this corresponds to a certain value of
g2D. If one were to perform the experiment with a diﬀer-
ent value of L, one would simulate a diﬀerent Bose gas
(with diﬀerent g2D) for the same value of a3D. In order
to plan and devise an experimental setup it is crucial to
know the eﬀective a2D and g2D which can be reached for

√

a given L, and the formulas (40) and (44) are abundantly
applied in the experimental cold atoms literature.
On the other hand, in view of attempting to quantum
simulate 2D systems, we may ask: Given L (cid:54)= 0, can we
be sure that we are measuring the critical temperature of
the 2D system and not that of its quasi-2D relatives? By
ﬁxing a2D (instead of a3D) for small L in the dimensional
crossover we conﬁrm with the study in App A 2 that the
critical temperature is enhanced by the residual inﬂuence
of the third dimension. This is not too surprising as we
expect the possibility of Bose condensation in d > 2 to
largely increase the critical temperature. Furthermore,
we found that the true 2D critical temperature is realized
for a considerable range of (L/a2D)-values.

Our discussion of the low-energy T-matrix to describe
the scattering properties of the Bose gas was mostly in-
spired by the aim to benchmark the relation (39) be-
tween the 3D and 2D scattering lengths obtained with the
FRG. However, given an exact or approximate expression
for the T-matrix of the conﬁned system, an obstacle of
analysing current cold atom experiments can be resolved:
At large densities – especially for fermionic system, which
do not diﬀer from the bosonic counterparts in their scat-
tering properties – the typical momenta of particles are
not necessarily small. Hence one needs to restrict the ex-
periment to low densities, or the scattering cross sections
and eﬀective coupling constants need to be evaluated at
a ﬁnite momentum [67–70]. This may eﬀectively be ac-
complished with the energy- and momentum-resolved T-
matrix of the conﬁned system with its particular discrete
mode spectrum such as in Eq. (54). To resolve this mode
spectrum, one may actually restrict to phenomenological
collective mode spectra such as in Refs. [71–73]. Comple-
mentary approaches to obtain the scattering properties
inside a medium from the vacuum T-matrix, however for
a true 2D system, have been successfully applied, for in-
stance, to the Fermi polaron problem [74].

Through conﬁning the gas by means of a potential
well with pbc, the challenging task of determining the
interacting ground state of the system became particu-
larly simple: The ground state is still homogeneous in
space and given by the minimum of the eﬀective poten-
tial Uk→0(φ2). However, as discussed at the end of Sec.
II, the situation becomes more complicated already for
a box potential with inﬁnite walls. Whereas in a Hamil-
tonian formulation the ground states of the interacting
system are required for computing expectation values of
observables, the interacting ground state enters the func-
tional integral formulation by the need to evaluate the ef-
fective action Γ[φ] at its minimum conﬁguration φ0(τ, (cid:126)x).
The latter, however, will not be constant in space for a
trapped system, i.e., we are dealing with an inhomoge-
neous ground state. Thus, strictly speaking, the ground
state can no longer be found by minimizing the eﬀective
potential Uk→0(φ2) evaluated for constant ﬁelds. Still
one might deﬁne a suitable modiﬁcation of the eﬀective
potential which captures the energy of the lowest lying
excitations, which might be modelled in a ﬁrst approx-

9

imation by the non-interacting states or deformations
thereof.

At last we discuss the relevance of our ﬁndings for trap-
ping potentials diﬀerent from a well with pbc. The main
diﬀerence when trapping the system in a box potential or
a harmonic trap consists (i) in the fact that the ground
states of the latter are inhomogeneous and (ii) that the
related ground state energies E0 are nonzero. We already
addressed the ﬁrst point in the previous paragraph. In
fact, it should constitute the main technical diﬃculty in
the computation of diﬀerent conﬁnement scenarios with
the FRG.

To understand the role of (ii) note that the emergent
2D scattering physics relied on a logarithmic singular-
ity of the eﬀective 2D-T-matrix as E → 0, see Eq. (55).
This divergence allows us to read oﬀ the eﬀective 2D scat-
tering length. For a system with nonvanishing E0, the
logarithmic divergence will appear for ∆E → 0 where
E = E0 + ∆E. This is true for harmonic conﬁnement
[58, 59], and a preliminary calculation for the T-matrix
in a box suggests that the same pattern appears, with
a formula relating a3D and a2D analogous to Eq. (39).
Consequently, the emergent 2D physics appear in the ef-
fective 2D continuum of states just above the zero point
energy, see Fig. 1. Subtracting the shift of energies due
to E0, e.g. by a chemical potential or by evaluating the
“eﬀective potential” at a nonzero frequency, the remain-
ing ﬁeld theory describing scattering and the superﬂuid
phase transition will be very similar to the one consid-
ered here with pbc.
In fact, we have shown that Eqs.
(39) and (43) are in one-to-one correspondence to the
results for harmonic conﬁnement with (cid:96)z once we iden-
tify (cid:96)eﬀ
z = L/
2π as the eﬀective oscillator length of the
potential well.

FIG. 6: Dimensional crossover of the superﬂuid critical tem-

parameters as described in this appendix. One observes three

increases. However, since we have chosen Λ/
this region corresponds to 1 ≤ LΛ ≤ 10 and thus violates
the criterion L (cid:29) Λ−1. Thus it is not of relevance for this

discussion. (ii) For intermediate L
µ, the critical tempera-
ture settles at Tc/µ = 1.32 (horizontal dashed line), which is
the transition temperature for the corresponding 2D gas with
the same value of a2D. In this region, which corresponds to
L/a2D = (1 − 3) × 103 in this particular case, the gas is truly

two-dimensional. (iii) For larger L, we ﬁnd an increase of the

critical temperature. Note that the crossover scale L
between the 2D and the quasi-2D regime is still much larger
than T −1/2 and µ−1/2. The slight dimple in Tc/µ before the
rising seems to root in the same oscillatory crossover behavior
as also found for small L, and we do not attribute any deep
physical meaning to it at this point.

First note that Eq.

(35) implies that a3D cannot
be arbitrary large within our model with pointlike in-
teractions.
Indeed, for ﬁxed Λ, the scattering length
is bounded from above according to a3D < amax =
3π )−1 = 2.36Λ−1 [24]. In particular, for Λ → ∞ we have
( 4Λ
a3D → 0, meaning that the pointlike approximation can-
not describe the interacting system up to arbitrarily high
energies. For ﬁxed L this implies a2D < Le− 1
2 (L/amax) due
to Eq. (39). Thus, in typical experiments with ﬁxed L,
the range of accessible a2D is also limited from above.

x − 2

Λ = log(x)

On the other hand, one may ﬁx a2D and Λ, and de-
termine the possible values of L which realize this par-
ticular a2D. This leads us to considering the function
f (x) = 4πa2D/λ3D
3π (Λa2D) with x = L/a2D.
A stable solution requires f (x) to be positive, leading to a
stability interval [Lmin, Lmax] of possible L-values. From
Eqs. (49) and (C16) we see that, disregarding some mod-
iﬁcations due to the regularization procedure, we have
Λa2D < 1. For instance, choosing Λa2D = 0.1 (0.01) we
arrive at xmin (cid:39) 1.02 (1.002) and xmax (cid:39) 260 (3900).
The corresponding value of Lmin, however, will typically
be too small as we also need to satisfy LΛ (cid:29) 1.

For our discussion of the dimensional crossover at ﬁxed

FIG. 5: Critical temperature Tc/µ in 2D as a function of
g2D over four orders of magnitude. For better comparability
with Eq. (A2) we have multiplied the function by g2D. The
blue points and solid line constitute the FRG result for tf =
−10 (as used in the main text), whereas the red dashed line
corresponds to the asymptotic form of Eq. (A2) for small g2D.
For the dashed line we use the ﬁt result from Tab. A 1.

For tf = −10, as employed in the main text, we ﬁnd
the g2D-dependence of Tc/µ to be in good agreement with
the asymptotic form of Eq. (26), i.e.,

when choosing A = 0.99 and ξµ = 6.0. We visualize
the coupling dependence of the critical temperature in

sistently ﬁnd scaling according to Eq.
(A2) with only
mild variations of the parameters A and ξµ, which we
collect in Tab. A 1. The corresponding values have been
obtained from a ﬁt of Tc/µ to Eq. (A2) in the interval
g2D ∈ [10−4, 0.01].

2. Dimensional crossover for ﬁxed a2D

In order to perform the dimensional crossover for ﬁxed
a2D we need to choose the initial conditions of the ﬂow
rather careful. Here we collect the technical details and
parameters which allow us to conclude that the critical
temperature of the 2D gas is enhanced by the inﬂuence
of a suﬃciently large third dimension.

and vary L within the boundaries allowed by these con-
straints. We choose Lmin = Λ−1 from LΛ > 1 and
Lmax = 3885a3D from the positivity of f (x). The critical
temperature of the pure 2D gas for this choice of parame-
ters is Tc/µ = 1.32. The resulting crossover of the critical
temperature is shown in Fig. 6.

In this appendix we clarify the roles played by the low-
energy T-matrix, the scattering vertex, and the dimer
propagator in the FRG approach to scattering of non-
relativistic bosons. A key result for the analysis of the
dimensional crossover is given by the translations formu-
las between the initial couplings λΛ of the RG ﬂow and
the scattering lengths a. In this section we denote the
2D and 3D scattering lengths by a3 and a2, respectively.
We further write

φ = iq0 + q2 − µ

perature is set to T = 0 for the scattering problem.

The additional term on the right hand side results from
the particular form of the regulator (C10) employed in
our FRG approach. As a consequence, the relationship
