Stable Ergodicity and Accessibility for certain

Partially Hyperbolic Diﬀeomorphisms with

Bidimensional Center Leaves

Vanderlei Horita and Martin Sambarino ∗

Abstract

We consider classes of partially hyperbolic diﬀeomorphism f :
M → M with splitting T M = Es ⊕ Ec ⊕ Eu and dim Ec = 2.
These classes include for instance (perturbations of) the product of
Anosov and conservative surface diﬀeomorphisms, skew products of
surface diﬀeomorphisms over Anosov, partially hyperbolic symplecto-
morphisms on manifolds of dimension four with bidimensional center
foliation whose center leaves are all compact. We prove that acces-
sibility holds in these classes for C 1 open and C r dense subsets and
moreover they are stably ergodic.

Introduction

Ergodicity plays a fundamental role in Dynamics (and in Probability and
Physics) since L. Boltzmann stated the “ergodic hypothesis” which says
(roughly speaking) that in an evolution law time average and space aver-
age are equal. More precisely, we say that a dynamical system f : M → M
preserving a ﬁnite measure m is ergodic (with respect to m) if any invariant
set has zero measure or its complement has zero measure.

E. Hopf [Hop39] proved the ergodicity of the geodesic ﬂow on surfaces
of negative curvature. This was extended by Anosov to the geodesic ﬂow
on compact manifolds with negative curvature in a cornerstone paper in
dynamics [Ano67]. He also proved that conservative (today called) Anosov
C 1+α diﬀeomorphisms are ergodic. And, since Anosov diﬀeomorphisms are
open, the above implies that conservative Anosov systems are stably ergodic.
We say that a C r diﬀeomorphism f : M → M preserving a measure m is C r
stably ergodic if any suﬃciently small C r perturbation of f preserving m is
ergodic.

In a seminal work, Grayson, Pugh, and Shub [GPS94] proved that the
time one map of the geodesic ﬂow of a hyperbolic surface is C 2 stably ergodic.

Afterwards, Ch. Pugh and M. Shub recovered (in some sense) Smale´s pro-
gram in the sixties about stability and genericity by restricting to partially
hyperbolic diﬀeomorphisms on manifolds preserving the Lebesgue measure
and replacing structural stability by stable ergodicity. They conjectured
that among C 2 partially hyperbolic diﬀeomorphism preserving the Lebesgue
measure m, stable ergodicity holds in an open and dense set. They proved
important results in this direction and they proposed a program as well (see
[PS96], [PS97], and [PS00]). The main conjecture is:

Conjecture 1 ([PS00]). On any compact manifold, ergodicity holds for an
open and dense set of C 2 volume preserving partially hyperbolic diﬀeomor-
phisms.

This conjecture splits into two conjectures where accessibility (see Deﬁ-

nition 1.3) plays a key role:

Conjecture 2 ([PS00]). Accessibility holds for an open and dense set of C 2
partially hyperbolic diﬀeomorphism, volume preserving or not.

Conjecture 3 ([PS00]). A partially hyperbolic C 2 volume preserving diﬀeo-
morphism with the essential accessibility property is ergodic.

They also proved [PS00] a result in the direction of the third conjec-
ture: A partially hyperbolic C 2 volume preserving diﬀeomorphism, dynami-
cally coherent, center bunched, and with the essential accessibility property
is ergodic. Since then, a lot of research on the ﬁeld has been done. See the
surveys [BPSW01], [RHRHU07], [Wil10], and [Cro14] for an account on this
progress during the last decades.

In [BW10], K. Burns and A. Wilkinson improved a lot Pugh-Shub result in
two directions: dynamically coherence is not needed and the center bunching
condition is much milder than originally stated.

The key fact thus to obtain ergodicity is accessibility.

In [DW03] it is
proved that accessibility holds for a C 1 open and dense subset of C r partially
hyperbolic diﬀeomorphism, volume preserving or not. When the center bun-
dle has dimension one, it is proved in [RHRHU08] that accessibility holds
for a C 1 open and C r dense subset of C r partially hyperbolic volume pre-
serving diﬀeomorphism (later extended to the non-volume preserving case in
[BHH+08]). This in particular implies the main conjecture in its full gener-
ality when the center dimension is one.

There has been in the last years a great advance to the main conjecture in
the C 1 topology. In fact in [RHRHTU07] it is proved that stably ergodicity
is C 1 dense when the center dimension is two. And recently, an outstand-
ing result has been obtained by A. Avila, S. Crovisier, and A. Wilkinson
[ACW15]: stable ergodicity is C 1 dense in any case (without any assumption
on the dimension of the center bundle).

These results depends heavily on perturbation techniques available in the
C 1 topology and not known on higher topologies. The C r denseness of stable

2

ergodicity, r ≥ 2, is a complete diﬀerent problem. Little is known in this case
when the center bundle has dimension greater than one. In [BW99], the au-
thors prove C r density of stable ergodicity for group extensions over Anosov
diﬀeomorphisms. A remarkable result has been obtained by F. Rodriguez-
Hertz [RH05] for certain automorphisms of the torus Td. Also, in [SW00] are
given two examples that can be C r, r ≥ 2, approximated by stable ergodic
ones. And very recently Z. Zhang [Zha15] obtained C r density of stable
ergodicity for volume preserving diﬀeomorphisms satisfying some pinching
condition and a certain type of dominated splitting on the center. A. Avila
and M. Viana have announced C 1 openness and C r density for certain skew
product of surfaces diﬀeomorphisms over Anosov and our work might have
some overlap with theirs although our methods are diﬀerent.

Our aim in this paper is to contribute to the C r denseness of stable ergod-
icity, in particular when the center dimension is two. We prove that for large
classes of C r partially hyperbolic volume preserving diﬀeomorphisms with
two dimensional center bundle, stable ergodicity holds in C r dense subsets.
Precise statements are given in Section 1.2. However, just to give a ﬂavor of
them let us state a particular case (see Theorem 4).

Theorem 1. Ergodicity holds in C 1 open and C r dense subset in the follow-
ing settings:

• Skew products of conservative surfaces diﬀeomorphisms over conserva-

tive Anosov diﬀeomorphisms

• Partially hyperbolic symplectomorphisms on (M, ω) where dimM = 4

having a bidimensional center foliation whose leaves are all compact.

The main tool we use to prove the ergodicity is accessibility. Thus, we
have to prove that accessibility holds in a C 1 open and C r dense subset in the
setting we are working with. The main idea is to use results on conservative
surface dynamics to show that generically one gets accessibility.
Indeed,
when the center dimension is two and we look to the accessibility class inside
a (periodic) compact center leaf we have three possibilities: it has zero, one or
two topological dimensions. We prove that generically (see Theorem 2) zero
dimensional accessibility classes do not exist. We will use to the full extent
results on conservative surface dynamics to prove that also generically one-
dimensional accessibility classes do not exist and therefore the accessibility
classes are open on the center leaf and so there is just one accessibility class.

1.1 Setting

Let f : M → M be a diﬀeomorphism where M is a compact riemannian
manifold without boundary. We say that f is partially hyperbolic if the
tangent bundle splits into three subbundles T M = Es ⊕ Ec ⊕ Eu invariant
under the tangent map Df and such that:

3

• There exists 0 < λ < 1 such that

kDf/E sk < λ

and

kDf −1

/E uk < λ.

• For every x ∈ M we have

kDf/E s
xk
x}
m{Df/E c

< 1

and

kDf/E c
xk
x }
m{Df/E u

< 1,

where m{A} is the co-norm of A, i.e., m{A} = kA−1k−1.

By continuity of Df and the compactness of M, there is a positive constant
η < 1 such that the inequalities in the last item hold for η instead of 1. In
other words, Es is uniformly contracted, Eu is uniformly expanded and the
behaviour of Ec is between both.

It is well known that the subbundles Es and Eu uniquely integrate to
two foliations F s = F s
f called the stable and unstable foliation
respectively. We denote by F σ(x) (σ = s, u) the leaf of the foliation through
the point x.

f and F u = F u

On the other hand it is not always true that the center subbundle Ec is
integrable. We say that the partially hyperbolic diﬀeomorphism f is dynam-
ically coherent if the bundles Es ⊕ Ec and Ec ⊕ Eu integrate to invariant
foliations F cs and F cu called the center stable and center unstable foliations
respectively. In particular Ec integrates to a (normally hyperbolic) invariant
foliation F c. Moreover, F c and F s subfoliates F cs and F c and F u subfoliates
F cu, see [BW08].

We say the center foliation is r-normally hyperbolic (r ≥ 1) if the following

holds:

xk
kDf/E s
x}r < 1
m{Df/E c

and

xkr
kDf/E c
m{Df/E u
x }

< 1.

If f is of class C r and the center foliation is r-normally hyperbolic then the
leaves of F c are of C r class (see [HPS77]).

Partially hyperbolic diﬀeomorphisms are C 1 open.

In order to assure
that dynamically coherence also holds for C 1 systems nearby we have to
require plaque expansiveness. This is technical and we will not deﬁne it
here, we refer to [HPS77] (however, if F c is a C 1 foliation or all leaves of
F c are compact then the center foliation is plaque expansive). The results
on [HPS77] (see Theorem 7.4) assure that a normally hyperbolic and plaque
expansive foliation F c
f of a diﬀeomorphism f is structurally stable, that is,
there exist a neighborhood of U(f ) and a homeomorphism h : M → M such
that for g ∈ U(f ) there exists a (normally hyperbolic) foliation F c
g such that
h(F c
g (g(h(x))). This result implies
that partially hyperbolic diﬀeomorphisms, dynamically coherent with center
foliation plaque expansive are C 1 open.

f (f (x))) = F c

< 1.

This bunching condition is as in [BW10] where they improve substantially
the one stated by Pugh-Shub originally. Notice that the bunching condition
is also C 1 open.

We say that a partially hyperbolic diﬀeomorphism f : M → M dynami-
cally coherent has Global Product Structure if there is a covering π : ˜M → M
and a lift ˜f : ˜M → ˜M of f such that when we lift the invariant foliations
(stable, unstable, center-stable, and center-unstable) to ˜M we have for any
˜x, ˜y in ˜M :

#{ ˜F cs(˜x) ∩ ˜F u(˜y)} = 1

and

#{ ˜F cu(˜x) ∩ ˜F s(˜y)} = 1.

Under the conditions where the center foliation is structurally stable we
have that Global Product Structure is also C 1 open. The above allow us to
deﬁne a global projection (in ˜M ) onto a given center stable manifold along
the holonomy of the unstable foliation.

Deﬁnition 1.1. Let M be a compact riemannian manifold without boundary
and let r ≥ 1. We denote by E r = E r(M) the set of C r diﬀeomorphisms
f : M → M (with the C r topology) such that

• f is partially hyperbolic;

• f is dynamically coherent;

• the center foliation is r-normally hyperbolic and plaque expansive;

• f is center bunched;

• f has Global Product Structure; and

• the set of center leaves that are compact and f -periodic are dense in

M.

We remark that E r is C 1 open (and hence C r open as well).

Examples. Here we give some examples of diﬀeomorphism in E r. We restrict
ourselves where the center dimension is two.

1. Perturbation of product of diﬀeomorphisms: Let g : S → S be a C r
diﬀeomorphism of a compact surface and let f : N → N be a transitive
Anosov diﬀeomorphism.
If the contraction and expansion of f are
strong enough we get that f × g ∈ E r(M) where M = N × S. Notice
that the center foliation consists of compact manifolds homeomorphic
to S. In case g = id then automatically f × g ∈ E r for any r ≥ 1.
Notice that if we denote by ˜N the universal covering of N then setting
˜M = ˜N × S and lifting f × g to ˜M we have Global Product Structure.

2. Let f : M → M be a volume preserving partially hyperbolic diﬀeo-
morphism dynamically coherent whose center leaves are all compact.
Results of Gogolev [Gog11] and Carrasco [Car11] state that the center
foliation is uniformly compact (that is, the leaves have ﬁnite holon-
omy). And also, Bohnet [Boh13] proved that if the center foliation is
uniformly compact and dim Eu is one, then there is a lift that ﬁbers
over an Anosov map on a torus. In particular we have that there is a lift
having Global Product Structure. Also, since f is volume preserving,
the periodic leaves are dense (see also [BB]). Thus, if f : M → M is
a volume preserving partially hyperbolic diﬀeomorphism, dynamically
coherent, r-normally hyperbolic, whose center leaves are all compact,
two dimensional, and dim M ≤ 5 (or dim Es = 1 or dim Eu = 1) then
f ∈ E r.

3. Skew Products over Anosov: Let f : N → N be a C r (transitive)
Anosov diﬀeomorphism and consider S a compact surface. Let U ⊂
Diﬀr(S) be the open set such that if h ∈ U then f × h is partially
hyperbolic with center ﬁber {x} × S, center bunched, and r-normally
hyperbolic. Let g : N → U be a continuous map. For x ∈ N lets denote
by gx the diﬀeomorphism g(x) : S → S. For such a map g consider the
skew product F = f ×sp g : N × S → N × S by

F (x, y) = (f (x), gx(y)).

We have that F ∈ E r(N × S). We may consider thus perturbations of
F in E r and also perturbations in the skew product setting. For this,
let G = {g : N → U : continuos}, where g, ˜g ∈ G are close if gx, ˜gx
are C r close for all x ∈ N. We denote by E r
sp the set of skew products
f ×sp g with g ∈ G.
If ω is an area (symplectic) form on S we denote by E r
skew products as above where gx preserves ω for all x ∈ N.

sp,ω the set of

4. (Perturbation of ) the product of the time t of an Anosov suspension and
a rotation: Consider f : N → N the time t map of the suspension of
a transitive Anosov diﬀeomorphism and let R : S1 → S1 be a rotation.
Let f × R : N × S1 → N × S1. It is not diﬃcult to see that belongs to
E r for any r as long as f is C r.

5. (Perturbation of ) the product of time maps of Anosov suspensions: Let
f, g be time maps of the suspensions of a transitive Anosov diﬀeomor-
phisms. Then f × g belongs to E r.

Remark 1.2. We considered time maps of Anosov suspensions so that
there is a lift with Global Product Structure. There are time-1 map of
Anosov ﬂows without Global Product Structure, for instance, time-1
map of the geodesic ﬂow in a surface of negative curvature.

1.2 Statements of Results

We denote by E r
ω the ones in E r preserving a symplectic form ω on

sp,ω(M) are the skew products over Anosov
diﬀeomorphism on M = N × S where S is a compact surface and ω is an
area form on S.

sp(M), E r

Our results mainly concerns accessibility, so let us introduce the concept.

Deﬁnition 1.3. Let f : M → M be a partially hyperbolic diﬀeomorphism
in E r. A su-path is a continuous curve α : [0, 1] → M such that there exists a
partition 0 = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn = 1 such that α([ti, ti+1]) is contained either
in a leaf of F s or in a leaf of F u. The relation x ∼ y if there exists a su-path
from x to y is an equivalence relation on M.

For a point x ∈ M the accessibility class AC(x) of x is:

AC(x) = {y ∈ M : there is a su-path from x to y}.

We say that f is accessible if AC(x) = M for some x (and hence for all
x ∈ M). On the other hand, we say the accessibility class AC(x) is trivial if
AC(x) ∩ F c(x) is totally disconnected.

Our ﬁrst result concerns trivial accessibility classes (with no restriction

on the dimension of the center leaves):

Theorem 2. Let r ≥ 2 and let E denote E r, E r
sp,ω. Then, the
set R0 of diﬀeomorphisms in E having no trivial accessibility classes is C 1
open and C r dense.

The next result gives a condition to assure accessibility when the center
leaves have dimension two. We say that f ∈ E r supports a Center Axiom-A if
there is a periodic compact center leave F c
is an Axiom-A dif-
feomorphism without having both periodic attractor and periodic repellers,
where k is the period of F c
1. We remark that the set f ∈ E r supporting a
Center Axiom-A is open in E r.

Theorem 3. Let r ≥ 2 and let EA (respectively EA,m) be the set of diﬀeo-
morphism in E r (respectively E r
m) supporting a Center Axiom-A. Assume that
dim Ec = 2. Then, the set of diﬀeomorphisms R1 in EA (or EA,m) that are
accessible are C 1 open and C r dense in EA (respectively EA,m). In particular
in EA,m they are stably ergodic.

Finally, our main result says that accessibility holds generically when, for

instance, a symplectic form is preserved (it implies Theorem 1):

Theorem 4. Let r ≥ 2 and let E denote E r
sp,ω. Then, there exists
R ⊂ E which is C 1 open and C r dense such that all diﬀeomorphism in R
are accessible.
ω they are stably ergodic
with respect to volume form induced by ω and in the skew product case E =
E r
sp,ω over a conservative Anosov diﬀeomorphism, they are stably ergodic with
respect to the volume form induced by volume form of the Anosov and ω.

In particular, in the case E = E r

Organization of the paper: In Section 2 we give general facts con-
cerning accessibility classes and some results regarding its structure when
the center has dimension two. In Section 3 we prove some perturbation re-
sults in order to obtain later some generic results on the accessibility classes.
Section 4 is devoted to prove Theorem 2. The accessibility classes of periodic
points are studied in Section 5, where it is proved that generically, when the
center subbundle has dimension two, the accessibility classes of hyperbolic
periodic points or elliptic (when we restrict to an invariant center leaf) are
open. Theorem 3 is proved in Section 6. Finally, in Section 7 we prove
Theorem 4.

2 Basic facts on accessibility

In this section we establish some basic results on accessibility. We assume
that f : M → M belongs to E r, r ≥ 2, although some remarks hold in
general.

When y ∈ F s(x) denote by Πs

f (F c(x), F c(y)) the (local) holonomy map
from a neighborhood of x in F c(x) to a neighborhood of y in F c(y) along
the stable leaves (inside F cs(x) = F cs(y)). This map is well deﬁned since
the leaves of F s are simple connected. By [PSW97] this holonomy map is
of class C 1, i.e., the holonomy map inside center stable leaves along stable
leaves is C 1. The same holds for center unstable leaves and holonomy along
unstable leaves and so, for Πu

f (F c(x), F c(y)).

Recall that a diﬀeomorphism f in E r has Global Product Structure, that
is, there exists a covering map π : ˜M → M such that denoting by ˜F ∗, ∗ =
s, u, cs, cu, c the lift of the stable, unstable, center stable, center unstable,
and center leaves respectively, then for every ˜x, ˜y ∈ ˜M we have:

#{ ˜F cs(˜x) ∩ ˜F u(˜y)} = 1 and #{ ˜F cu(˜x) ∩ ˜F s(˜y)} = 1.

This allows to deﬁne a continuous map

Πu

˜x : ˜M → ˜F cs(˜x),

(1)

deﬁned by the holonomy map along unstable leaves:

Πu

˜x(˜z) = ˜F u(˜z) ∩ ˜F cs(˜x).

If we restrict the map Πu

In an analogous way we deﬁne Πs
˜x : ˜M → ˜F c(˜x) by
also we deﬁne Πsu

˜x to ˜F cu(˜x), we have that Πu

˜x( ˜F cu(˜x)) = ˜F c(˜x).
˜x the holonomy along stable leaves. And

Πsu

˜x = Πs

˜x ◦ Πu
˜x.

Note that, in general, Πus

˜x 6= Πsu
˜x .

Recall that we have deﬁned the accessibility class of x ∈ M as

AC(x) = {y ∈ M : there is a su-path from x to y}.

We deﬁne the center accessibility class of x as C(x) = AC(x) ∩ F c(x).

The same deﬁnitions for ˜M : for ˜x ∈ ˜M its accessibility class isgAC(˜x) =
{˜y ∈ ˜M : there is a su-path from ˜x to ˜y} and eC(˜x) =gAC(˜x) ∩ eF c(˜x).

Let us observe that if

Lemma 2.1. Let ˜x ∈ ˜M and set x = π(˜x). Then

˜x, ˜z ∈ ˜M with ˜z ∈gAC(˜x) =⇒ Πsu

˜x (˜z) ∈ eC(˜x).

• π(gAC(˜x)) = AC(x).
• π(eC(˜x)) ⊂ C(x).
π(gAC(˜x)) ⊂ AC(x). Reciprocally, the lift of a su-path in M is a su-path in

Proof. Note that the projection of a su-path in ˜M is a su-path in M. Then,

˜M . The second part also follows easily:

π(eC(˜x)) = π(gAC(˜x) ∩ ˜F c(˜x)) ⊂ π(gAC(˜x)) ∩ π( ˜F c(˜x))

= AC(x) ∩ F c(x) = C(x).

The proof is complete.

Lemma 2.2. The following are equivalent:

a) AC(x) is an open subset.

b) AC(x) has non-empty interior.

c) C(x) is an open subset of F c(x)

d) C(x) has non-empty interior (in F c(x)).

Proof. Notice that, by continuity of F s, if U is an open set in M then the
saturation by stable leaves, i.e., ∪x∈U F s(x) is also open in M and the same for
the saturation by unstable leaves. Moreover, from the local product structure
due the partially hyperbolic structure, given an open set V in a center leaf,
its saturation by stable and unstable leaf is also an open set in M. From
these simple facts the lemma follows.

The same is true for the lift and also equivalent to the above:

Lemma 2.3. The following are equivalent:

a) gAC(˜x) is an open subset.

9

b) gAC(˜x) has non-empty interior.
c) eC(˜x) is an open subset of ˜F c(x).
d) eC(˜x) has non-empty interior (in ˜F c(x)).

e) C(x) is an open subset of F c(x).

Lemma 2.4. For any z ∈ M and any center leaf F c(x) we have that AC(z)∩
F c(x) 6= ∅. In particular, f is accessible if and only if for some x it holds
that C(x) = F c(x).

Proof. The Global Product Structure implies in particular that for any z and
x we have that:

F u(z) ∩ F cs(x) 6= ∅

and F cs(x) = [y∈F c(x)

F s(y)

which yields AC(z) ∩ F c(x) 6= ∅. The second part follows immediately.

Recall that for y ∈ F s(x) the (local) holonomy map Πs(F c(x), F c(y))
from a neighborhood U c
y of y in F c(y)
is a C 1 diﬀeomorphism. If γ : [0, 1] → F s(x) is a path joining x and y then
there exists a continuous map Γs : U c

x of x in F c(x) to a neighborhood U c

x × [0, 1] → F cs(x) such that:

• Γs(z, t) ∈ F s(z) ∀ t ∈ [0, 1]. In particular Γs(z, t) ∈ AC(z).

• Γs(z, 0) = z for all z ∈ U c
x.

• Γs(z, 1) = Πs(F c(x), F c(y))(z) ∈ U c
y .

• Γs

x → U c

0 : U c
diﬀeomorphism.

y deﬁned by Γs

0(z) = Γ(z, 1) = Πs(F c(x), F c(y))(z) is a C 1

The same holds when y ∈ F u(x) considering Πu(F c(x), F c(y)) and also
for the lift ˜f : ˜M → ˜M . In particular, if y ∈ AC(x) and γ is su-path joining
x to y, by ﬁnite composition of maps as above we get a map (see Figure 1)

Γ : U c

x × [0, 1] → M

(4)

such that

• Γ(z, t) ∈ AC(z) for all t ∈ [0, 1].

• Γ(z, 0) = z for all z ∈ U c
x.

• Γ(z, 1) ∈ U c
y .

• Γ0 : U c

x → U c

y deﬁned by Γ0(z) = Γ(z, 1) is a C 1 diﬀeomorphism.

with the properties above. The above has important consequences. First, we
recall the deﬁnition of a homogeneous subset.

Deﬁnition 2.5. Let X be a riemannian manifold. A subset Z ⊂ X is said
C r-homogeneous if for every pair of points x, y ∈ Z there are neighborhoods
Ux, Uy ⊂ X of x and y, respectively, and a C r-diﬀeomorphism φ : Ux → Uy
such that φ(Ux ∩ Z) = Uy ∩ Z and φ(x) = y.

Thus, it follows straightforward from the deﬁnitions of Γ and ˜Γ that:

Moreover, we have the following:

Lemma 2.6. C(x) and eC(˜x) are C 1-homogeneous.
Lemma 2.7. Let ˜x ∈ ˜M and ˜y ∈ eC(˜x). Then there are neighborhoods U c

Remark 2.8. Notice that projecting by π : ˜M → M we have a similar

result: given x in M and ˜x ∈ ˜M such that π(˜x) = x and y ∈ π(eC(˜x))

then there are neighborhoods U c

4. γ(z, t) ∈ C(z), for all z ∈ U c

x and t ∈ [0, 1].

Corollary 2.9. eC(x) is connected and arc-connected.

Recall that an accessibility class AC(x) is trivial if AC(x) ∩ F c(x) is
totally disconnected. Notice that by the map Γ deﬁned in (4) this does not
depend on x, just on the accessibility class.

{˜x} where π(˜x) = x.

Lemma 2.10. The accessibility class AC(x) is trivial if and only if eC(˜x) =
Proof. If eC(˜x) 6= {˜x} then, since it is connected and arc-connected we have
that π(eC(˜x)) ⊂ C(x) contains a non trivial connected set and so C(x) is not
totally disconnected. On the other hand, if eC(˜x) = {˜x} thengAC(˜x) ∩ ˜F c(˜y)

consists of a single point for any ˜y and in particular for those ˜y with π(˜y) = x.
Therefore C(x) is at most countable and so totally disconnected.

Corollary 2.11. The set {x ∈ M : AC(x) is nontrivial } is open in M.

Proof. Let x ∈ M be such that AC(x) is nontrivial and let ˜x such that

π(˜x) = x. Then eC(˜x) 6= {˜x}. Now, from Lemma 2.7 we get for any ˜z ∈ ˜F c(˜x)
close enough to ˜x that eC(˜z) 6= {˜z} and the lemma follows.

The above says that if we have a nontrivial accessibility class then nearby
the classes are nontrivial. Indeed, the same holds when we perturb also f :

Corollary 2.12. Let f ∈ E r and let x ∈ M be such that AC(x) is nontrivial.
Then, there exist a neighborhood Ux of x and a neighborhood U(f ) in E r
(which can be considered C 1 open as well) such that for any g ∈ U(f ) and
z ∈ Ux the accessibility class AC(z, g) is nontrivial.

Proof. Let ˜x be such that π(˜x) = x. Since AC(x) is nontrivial, then eC(˜x) 6=
{˜x}. Let ˜y ∈ eC(˜x), ˜y 6= ˜x. We have a su-path (in ˜M ) joining ˜x to ˜y. Now,

by continuity of stable and unstable manifolds on compact sets (with respect
to the point and to f ) there are disjoint open sets U˜x and U˜y of ˜x and ˜y
in ˜M and an open set U(f ) such that for any g in U(f ) we have that any
point in U˜x can be joined by su-path of ˜g with a point in U˜y. And moreover,
if we consider Πsu
˜g (U˜y) are open sets
(in F c(˜x, ˜g)) and disjoint. The result thus follows, since for any ˜z ∈ Πsu
˜g (U˜x)
there is point in Πsu

˜g : ˜M → F c(˜x, ˜g), then Πsu

˜g (U˜x) and Πsu

˜g (U˜y) that belongs to eC(˜z, g).

Lemma 2.13. Let x ∈ M and let ˜x ∈ ˜M with π(˜x) = x. Let ˜F c
be such that π( ˜F c

i , i = 1, 2. Then either

Proof. Assume that π( ˜C1) ∩ π( ˜C2) 6= ∅. Let z be in this intersection and let

˜zi ∈ ˜Ci be such that π(˜zi) = z. It follows that ˜Ci = eC(˜zi). Let β be a covering

map, β(˜z1) = ˜z2. Since β sends su-path in ˜M to su-path we conclude that
β( ˜C1) ⊂ ˜C2 and β−1( ˜C2) ⊂ ˜C1. Hence π( ˜C1) = π( ˜C2).

Corollary 2.14. Let x ∈ M and ˜x ∈ ˜M such that π(˜x) = x. If C(x) is open

then π(eC(˜x)) is the connected component of C(x) that contains x.

Proof. It is a direct consequence of Lemmas 2.1, 2.3, and 2.13.

We now investigate the structure of accessibility classes when the center
bundle has dimension two, that is f ∈ E r and dim Ec = 2. The following
important result is essentially contained in [RH05].

Theorem 2.15. Let f ∈ E r and assume that dim Ec = 2. Let ˜x ∈ ˜M . Then
one and only one of the following holds:

open, consists just of ˜x or it is a topological one dimensional manifold. Now,

1. eC(˜x) is open;
2. eC(˜x) = {˜x};
3. eC(˜x) is a C 1 one dimensional manifold without boundary.
Proof. The same proof in [RH05, Proposition 5.2] yields that eC(˜x) is either
in case eC(˜x) is a topological one dimensional manifold, by the C 1 homogene-
ity of eC(˜x) and the result in [RSˇS96] which says that a locally compact and
get that in fact eC(˜x) is of class C 1 (and without boundary).

Let us denote by C0(x) the arc-connected component of C(x) that con-
tains x. We remark that when C(x) is open, then C0(x) is just the connected
component of C(x) that contains x.

C 1 homogeneous subset of a riemannian manifold is a C 1 submanifold, one

Corollary 2.16. Let f ∈ E r and assume that dim Ec = 2. Let x ∈ M and

(without boundary).

˜x ∈ ˜M with π(˜x) = x. Then π(eC(˜x)) = C0(x).
Proof. When eC(x) is open or trivial then the result follows immediately.
Thus, we just have to check it when eC(x) is a one dimensional submanifold
From Lemma 2.1 and Corollary 2.9 we have π(eC(˜x)) ⊂ C0(x). On the
contained in π(eC(˜x)). Let t0 = sup{t : β([0, t]) ⊂ π(eC(˜x))}. Let y = β(t0)
(that belongs to π(eC(˜x))). Since eC(˜x) has no boundary, we have an arc α

other hand, let β be an arc in C0(x) starting at x and assume that it is not

inside π(eC(x)) having y in its interior, say joining x1 with x2. Now, applying

Lemma 2.7 (or Remark 2.8) we have a continuous map γ : U c
x1 ×[0, 1] → F c(x)
such that γ(x1, t) = α(t) and that γ(z, t) ∈ C(z) for any t and z ∈ Ux1. Then
we conclude that there is an open set U ⊂ Ux1 such that γ(U × [0, 1]) ∩ β 6= ∅
(see Figure 2). This implies that C(x) is open, a contradiction. Therefore,

C0(x) ⊂ π(eC(˜x)). The proof is ﬁnished.

Next, we want to show that the set of one dimensional accessibility classes
form a lamination. Lets recall the deﬁnition of a lamination (we stated for
the case of lamination of subsets of a surface for simplicity.

Deﬁnition 2.17. Let S be a surface and let K ⊂ S be closed. We say
that K admits a C 1-lamination if K has a partition into C 1 one dimensional
manifolds (called leaves of the lamination) such that every point in K has
a neighborhood U homeomorphic to (−1, 1) × (−1, 1) (called charts of the
lamination) such that K ∩ U correspond to F × (−1, 1), where F is a closed
set in (−1, 1) and every {f} × (−1, 1), for f ∈ F , is inside a leaf of K, and
tangent spaces of the leaves vary continuously.

Fix a center leaf ˜F c. Let ˜K be the set of accessibility classes in ˜F c
which are C 1 one-dimensional submanifolds. Then ˜K is partitioned by the
accessibility classes ˜C(˜x), ˜x ∈ ˜K. We want to prove that this partition form
a C 1-lamination.

First we prove that the accessibility classes vary continuously in the C 1-

topology:

Proposition 2.18. For ˜x ∈ ˜K, the curves ˜C(˜x) vary continuously in the C 1
topology.

Before proving the proposition we need an elementary lemma from cal-
culus. Let us introduce some notations. Let γ : [0, 1] → S be an C 1-arc of a

14

surface S and consider an ε-tubular neighborhood Nγ. This tubular neigh-
borhood is diﬀeomorphic to [0, 1] × [−ε, ε]. Given a point in Nγ we identify
with coordinates (t, s), t ∈ [0, 1] and s ∈ [−ε, ε].

We call the left side of Nγ the boundary {0} × [−ε, ε] and right side
the boundary {1} times[−ε, ε]. We denote by π : Nγ → γ the orthogonal
projection, i.e., in local coordinates π(t, s) = t.

Lemma 2.19. With the notations above, given δ > 0, there exists ε = ε(δ)
such that if β is a C 1-curve in Nγ from the left to the right side (and
do not intersect γ) then there is some (t, s) = β(˜t) such that the angle
∠( ˙β(˜t), ˙α(t)) < δ.

Now we are ready to give a proof of Proposition 2.18. Since we will be
working in a neighborhood of ˜F c we may assume that we are in trivialization
chart of the tangent bundle T ˜F c, and so we may compare angles and norms
of vectors in diﬀerent tangent spaces.

Proof of Proposition 2.18. We need to prove that if ˜x ∈ ˜K and ˜xn ∈ ˜K
˜C(˜xn) converges to T˜x ˜C(˜x). Assume that it is not
converges to ˜x then T˜xn
true. Then there exists some sequence ˜xn ∈ ˜K converging to some point
˜C(˜xn), T˜x ˜C(˜x)) > η, for all
˜x ∈ ˜K and some η > 0 such that the angle ∠(T˜xn
n.

Let ˜y ∈ ˜C(˜x), ˜y 6= ˜x and let Υsu a su-path joining ˜y to ˜x. We may
consider an arc of su-paths, i.e., for each t ∈ [0, 1] a su-path Υsu
that vary
t
continuously joining ˜x with some point Υsu
is the
trivial su-path and Υsu
t (1) is
the arc joining ˜x and ˜y in ˜C(˜x) denoted by [˜x, ˜y]. We will consider tubular
neighborhood N of the arc [˜x, ˜y].

t (1) ∈ ˜C(˜x) such that Υsu
1 = Υsu. We may assume that the path Υsu

0

The path Υsu

t allows us to consider (see the last item of properties of the
map Γ in (4) and equivalent for (5)) a map φt : B(˜x, rt) → ˜F c which is a C 1
diﬀeomorphism onto its image that contains Υsu
t (1). We may choose rt = r
independent of t. The family φt varies continuously in the C 1 topology due
to the local holonomy is C 1 inside center stable and center unstable leaves,
the center foliation is C 1 and the path Υsu

t varies continuously with t.

Given θ > 0 there exists δ0 > 0 and ρ0 > 0 such that for any t if

dist(˜z, ˜x) < ρ0 and ∠(T˜x ˜C(˜x), w) > θ then the angle

∠(d(φt)˜x(T˜x ˜C(˜x)), d(φt)˜z(w)) = ∠(Tφt(˜x) ˜C(˜x)), d(φt)˜z(w)) > δ0.

(6)

On the other hand, given δ1 > 0 there exists ε1 > 0 such that if

dist(π(φt(˜z)), φt(˜x)) < ε1 then ∠(Tπ(φt(˜z)) ˜C(˜x), Tφt(˜x) ˜C(˜x)) < δ1.

(7)

Notice also that there exists ρ > 0 such that for any t if

dist(˜x, ˜z) < ρ then dist(π(φt(˜z), φt(˜x)) < ε1.

(8)

15

Consider ˜x1 and ˜y1 in ˜C(˜x) between ˜x and ˜y. Denote by γ = [˜x1, ˜y1] the

arc in ˜C(˜x) joining ˜x1 and ˜y1.

Let θ = η and take δ0 = δ0(θ) from (6). Choose δ1 > 0 such that

δ0 − δ1 = δ > 0 and let ε1 from (7). Choose ρ < ρ0 such that (8) holds.

For this δ choose an ε tubular neighborhood N[˜x1,˜y1] as in Lemma 2.19

and such that N[˜x1,˜y1] ⊂ ∪t∈[0,1]φt(B(˜x, ρ)).

Now, if ˜xn is close enough to ˜x then βn(t) = φt(˜xn), t ∈ [0, 1] is a curve
that crosses the N[˜x1,˜y1] from the left to the right side. On the other hand, if
t is such that βn(t) ∈ N[˜x1,˜y1] then span( ˙βn) = d(φt(˜xn))(T˜xn

˜C(˜xn)) and so

∠( ˙βn(t), Tπ(βn(t)) ˜C(˜x)) = ∠(dφt(˜xn)T˜xn

˜C(˜xn), Tπ(φt(˜xn)) ˜C(˜xn))

> ∠(dφt(˜xn)T˜xn

˜C(˜xn), dφt(˜x)T˜x ˜C(˜x)−
− ∠(Tπ(φt(˜xn)) ˜C(˜xn), dφt(˜x)T˜x ˜C(˜x))

> δ0 − δ1 = δ,

which is a contradiction with Lemma 2.19.

Corollary 2.20. Let ˜F c be a center leaf in ˜M and assume that there is no
trivial accessibility classes. Then the set ˜K of non-open accessibility classes
admits a C 1-lamination whose leaves are accessibility classes. The same holds
for the set of non open accessibility classes K in F c whose leaves are con-
nected components of accessibility classes C0(x) for x ∈ K.
Proof. Since there is no trivial accessibility class the set ˜K is closed. From
Proposition 2.18 and using transversal sections it is not diﬃcult to construct
a chart for each ˜x ∈ ˜K.

3 Perturbation Lemmas

In this section we prove our main perturbation techniques that allow us to
prove our theorems. These are Lemmas 3.5 and 3.7. Before we state and
prove these lemmas we need some elementary results, the ﬁrst one says that
some perturbations of the identity can be thought as translations in terms of
local coordinates, no matter if we are in the conservative world, symplectic
world, etc.

Let M be a manifold of dimension d and let S ⊂ M be an embedded
submanifold of M of dimension k. Let z ∈ S and let U be a neighborhood of
z in M and let V be the connected component of U ∩ S containing z. We say
that we have local canonical coordinates in V if we have a coordinate chart
(or parametrization) ϕ : U → Rd and ϕ(V ) = V0 ⊂ Rk with ϕ(z) = 0.

It is a consequence of Darboux Theorem that if ω is a symplectic form
in M such that ω/S is symplectic and k = 2j, d = 2l and we write coordi-
nates in Rk as (x1, . . . , xj, y1, . . . , yj) and in Rd as (x1, . . . , xl, y1, . . . , yl) then
i=1 dxi ∧ dyi) = ω|U and

we may assume that the local chart veriﬁes ϕ∗(Pd
ϕ∗(Pj

i=1 dxi ∧ dyi) = ω|V , see e.g. [Mos65] and [Wei71].

16

And in case m is a volume form it is well known that we can choose local
coordinates in Rd as (x1, . . . , xd), we may assume also that ϕ∗(dx1 ∧ · · · ∧
dxd) = m, i.e., in local coordinates the volume form is the standard volume
form in Rd (see e.g. [Mos65]).

The next lemma says that we can glue an arbitrary small translation
near a point with the identity outside a neighborhood in the conservative
and symplectic setting. Sophisticated versions of this problem can be found
in [DM90] and [AM07] (pasting lemma).

Lemma 3.1. Let M be a C r manifold and let S ⊂ M be a C r submanifold
of M, r ≥ 1. Let z ∈ S and let U be a given neighborhood of z in M
such that V := S ∩ U has local canonical coordinates. Then, there exist V ′,
z ∈ V ′ ⊂ V ⊂ U and ε0 > 0 such that for any 0 ≤ ε ≤ ε0 there exists δ > 0
such that for any w ∈ Rk, kwk < δ there exists a diﬀeomorphism h : M → M
satisfying :

1. h is ε-C r close to identity;

2. h ≡ id on U c;

3. h preserves V , i.e. h(V ) = V ;

4. h|V ′ in local coordinates is given by

y 7→ h(y) = y + w.

If ω is a symplectic form in M and ω/S is symplectic then h can be taken
to be a symplectomorphism. If m is a volume form in M, we can take h to
preserves the volume form m.

Proof. In the general case (i.e neither conservative nor symplectic) the so-
lution is easy, just take the time t map (with t small enough) of the ﬂow
generated by a vector ﬁeld X (in the local coordinates) such that X(x) = v
for v ∈ Rk, kvk = 1 and it is identically zero outside a neighborhood of the
origin. The same idea works in the conservative setting taking X to be di-
vergence free vector ﬁeld and in the symplectic setting taking a Hamiltonian
vector ﬁeld.

Lets consider the conservative setting. Recall that we have local coor-
dinates, i.e., a chart ϕ : U → Rd and ϕ(V ) = V0 ⊂ Rk with ϕ(z) = 0 and
ϕ∗(dx1 ∧ · · · ∧ dxd) = m. Let ψ : Rd → R be a bump function such that it is
equal to 1 in a neighborhood of 0 and it is identically zero outside a neighbor-
hood of 0 as well (with closure contained in ϕ(U)). Let w ∈ Rk, kwk = 1. By
a linear change of coordinates (preserving Rk) we may assume that w = e1.
Consider the function χ : Rd → R given by

χ(x) = χ(x1, x2, . . . , xd) = ψ(x)x2.

17

Then, taking X(x) = ( ∂χ
, 0, . . . , 0) we have that X is divergence free.
∂x2
Now, taking the time t map of the ﬂow generated by X for t small we get
the lemma.

, − ∂χ
∂x1

Lets consider the symplectic case. We may assume without loss of gen-
erality that U is contained in a tubular neighborhood of S and U = U ′ × D,
D ﬁbers of the tubular neighborhood. Choose open balls V1 ⊂ V ′

U ′

and ψ|V1 ≡ 1.

For simplicity we will assume that S is bidimensional. Let u = (u1, u2) be
0 (x, y) = yu1 − xu2.

Let ˜H u

1 (y) =
0 (ϕ(π(y))), where π is the projection along the ﬁbers of the tubular neigh-

borhood, and let H u : M → R be such that

0 and let H u

0 = ψ · H u

· H u ≡ 0 in U c, and

· H u = ψ(y)H u

1 (y) if y ∈ U.

Notice that H u is C ∞ and the C r-norm is bounded by a constant K that
does not depend on u.

Let y ∈ S ∩ V1. We claim that XH u(y) = X S

H is the hamil-
tonian ﬁeld of H|S. Indeed, XH u(y) is deﬁned as ω(XH u(y), ·) = −dH u
y and
H u(y), ·) = −d(H u|S)y. For y ∈ V1 ∩ S, H u(y) = H u(π(y))
X S
y |(TyS)⊥ω = 0. Thus, for any
and so dH u = dH u|S ◦ dπ and hence dH u
v ∈ (TyS)⊥ω = 0, then XH u(y) ∈ TyS and so, since for any w ∈ TyS, we have

H u(y), where X S

H u(y) as ω0(X S

ω(XH u(y), w) = ω0(X S

H u(y), w).

We conclude that

XH u(y) = X S

H u(y).

This proves the claim. Finally, taking the time t map of the corresponding
hamiltonian ﬂow, for t small enough, we conclude the lemma.

Proof. Let B0, x ∈ B0 ⊂ B be a foliated chart of the center foliation :

ϕ : B0 → Dm−k × Dk,

where Dm−k is a disk in Rm−k and Dk is a disk in Rk, and the center foliation
in B0 through ϕ is {y} × Dk and ϕ(x) = (0, 0).

Let Px be the plaque of x in B0. We may assume that F c

1 ∩ B0 = Px. In
B0, we identify point in the same plaque, B0/∼ ∼= Dm−k. Let P : B0 → B0/∼
the projection map.

For z ∈ B0, denote by ˆz := P (z) the plaque of z and denote by W c∗

B0(z),
ε (F c(z)) ∩ B0 that contains z, and

∗ = s, u, the connected component of W ∗
by W ∗

B0(ˆz) := P (W c∗(z)) (B0 is small compared to ε).

In a neighborhood W of ˆx we have local product structure. Since periodic
compact center leaves are dense, we may choose ˆp1 ∈ W such that ˆp1 is
contained in a compact periodic center leaf. (This compact center leaf may
intersects B0 in other plaques than ˆp1, but if it does, intersects ﬁnitely many
plaques in B0).
Let ˆw1 = W s

Denote supp(f 6= g) = {y : f (y) 6= g(y)}. The next lemma says that we

can destroy trivial accessibility class.

Lemma 3.5. Let E be as in Theorem 2 and let f ∈ E and let F c(x) be a
periodic compact center leaf of f . Assume that C0(x) = {x}. Then, there
exists neighborhood Vx of x in F c(x) and ε0 > 0 such that for any 0 < ε ≤ ε0
there exists g ∈ E, with distC r (f, g) < ε such that:

1. supp(f 6= g) is disjoint from the f -orbit of F c(x),

2. for any y ∈ Vx we have C0(y, g)) 6= {y}.

Proof. Let x, w1, w2, p1, p2, z1, z2 and U1, U2 be as in Lemma 3.3. For simplic-
ity we write, ˆwi = F c(wi, f ), ˆzi = F c(zi, f ), and ˆpi = F c(pi, f ).

We may assume that Ui are small so that if Vi is the connected component

of Ui ∩ ˆwi that contains wi then Πs

f ( ˆwi, ˆx)(Vi) ⊂ W1.

Let ε > 0 be given (small) and let V ′
ˆwi corresponding to Vi and let Vx ⊂ Πs

Lets look l1 in the local canonical coordinates and let v in Rk, kvk < δ be
such that −v is a regular value of l1 − id. For this v, choose h1 : M → M

21

as in Lemma 3.1 (in the appropriate setting for E) and so h1 ◦ l1 has ﬁnitely
many ﬁxed points in V ′
1 of h1 ◦ l1 then
l1(q) − q = −v and since −v is a regular value of l1 − id it is an isolated ﬁxed
point.

1. Indeed, if q is a ﬁxed point in V ′

Let q1, . . . , qℓ be the projection of these ﬁxed points in V2, i.e, {q1, . . . , qℓ}
f ( ˆw1, ˆw2)(Fix(h1 ◦ l1|V 1)) ∩ V2. Choose h2 : M → M as in Lemma 3.1

= Πs
(corresponding to U2, V2) such that no qi is ﬁxed by h2 ◦ l2.

Let g : M → M be g = f ◦ h−1 where h : M → M is deﬁned by

h(z) =

It is not diﬃcult to see that (see Remark 3.4):

g(ˆzi, ˆpi) ◦ Πu

g (ˆx, ˆzi) = Πs

Now, the maps

g(ˆz1, ˆp1) ◦ Πu

g (ˆx, ˆz1)

and

Πs

g( ˆw2, ˆx) ◦ Πu

g (ˆp2, ˆw2) ◦ Πs

g(ˆz2, ˆp2) ◦ Πu

g (ˆx, ˆz2)

have no common ﬁxed point. Thus, for y ∈ Vx we have that either for i = 1
or 2 that

Πs

g( ˆwi, ˆx) ◦ Πu

g (ˆpi, ˆwi) ◦ Πs

g(ˆzi, ˆpi) ◦ Πu

g (ˆx, ˆzi)(y) 6= y.

This completes the proof.

We need the following elementary result. For completeness, we give a
proof in the appendix. It says roughly that two nondecreasing maps of the
interval with arbitrarily small translations have no ﬁxed points in common
(this is very simple when the maps are C 1 by transversality).

Proposition 3.6. Let ℓ1 : [−a, a] → R and ℓ2 : [−b, b] → R be two non-
decreasing maps and let φ : [−b, b] → [−a, a] be also a non-decreasing map.
Then for any ε > 0 there exist s, t, |s|, |t| ≤ ε, such that :

φ({x ∈ [−b, b] : ℓ2(x) + t = x}) ∩ {x ∈ [−a, a] : ℓ1(x) + s = x} = ∅.

Proof. See Appendix A.

We now present the last lemma of this section and it will play a key role

in the proof of our main result (Theorem 4).

1 be a periodic compact center leaf. Let x ∈ F c

Lemma 3.7. Let E be either E r
sp,ω (i.e. as in Theorem 4). Consider
f ∈ E and let F c
1 and assume
that C0(x) is a C 1-simple closed curve C. Let U be a neighborhood of C
homeomorphic to an annulus and assume that a family Γ of disjoint essential
simple closed curves contained in U is given, with C ∈ Γ. Then, there exist a
neighborhood V of C homeomorphic to an annulus and ε0 > 0 such that for
any 0 < ε ≤ ε0 there exist g ∈ E such that

1. distC r (f, g) < ε,

2. supp(f 6= g) is disjoint from the f -orbit of F c

1, and

3. no curve of Γ contained in V is the accessibility class of a point in V ,

i.e, for any y ∈ V, C0(y, g) 6= γ for any γ ∈ Γ.

Proof. Let x be as in statement of the lemma and let x, w1, w2, p1, p2, z1, z2
and U1, U2 be as in Lemma 3.3. Again, for simplicity we denote, ˆwi =
F c(wi, f ), ˆzi = F c(zi, f ), and ˆpi = F c(pi, f ). Let Vi be the connected com-
ponent of Ui ∩ ˆwi that contains wi and let V ′

In the local canonical coordinates in Vi,

phic to a closed annulus, such that both Ii crosses V and intersects C in just

that ˆJi crosses V . Notice that ˆJi are transversal to C. Let Ji be a connected
component of ˆJi ∩ V that crosses V (and we may assume that Ji intersects
C in just one point). We will deﬁne maps Pi : Ii → Ji, ϕ : I1 → I2, and
ψ : J1 → J2 as follows. We will just deﬁne P1 : I1 → J1, the others are
completely similar.

We order the arcs I1, I2, J1, J2 so that all of them crosses C in “positive”

direction.

Let γ ⊂ V be a curve in the family Γ. Let xγ be the closest point of γ ∩J1
(in the order of J1) to J1 ∩ C, and let yγ be the closest point of I1 ∩ γ (in the
order of I1 to x = I1 ∩ γ. See Figure 7.

Figure 7: The map P1 .

Deﬁne P1(yγ) := xγ. This is a map from {yγ : γ ∈ Γ} ⊂ I1 to {xγ : γ ∈
Γ} ⊂ J1. This map is non-decreasing since for γ, η ∈ Γ, γ 6= η, if yγ <I1 yη
then xγ <J1 xη (since each curve of Γ separates V in exactly two components
and the curves in Γ are disjoint).

Since the map is non-decreasing it may be extended to a non-decreasing
map P1 : I1 → J1. In the same say we deﬁne P2 : I2 → J2, ϕ : I1 → I2, and
ψ : J1 → J2.

Notice that for γ ∈ Γ and xγ as before we have

Let li : S′

from Ji to Ii preserves orientation (since it is a diﬀeomorphism). Set xi =
Ji ∩ C, we know that ˆli(xi) = x. If ˆli reverse orientation, then for y >Ji xi we
have that ˆli(y) <Ii x. Since C is essential in U we get that the accessibility
class of C0(y) must intersect C = C0(x) and hence C is not an accessibility
class, a contradiction.

Now, let ε > 0 be given and let δ be as in Lemma 3.1. For |s| < δ
and |t| < δ we choose h1 and h2 as in Lemma 3.1 so that in V ′
1 we have
h1(y) = y + v1, v1 in the direction of S1, kv1k = |s| and in V ′
2 we have
h2(y) = y + v2, v2 in the direction of S2, kv2k = |t|. So, S1 is invariant by h1
and S2 is invariant by h2, and parametrizing S1 and S2, these maps have the
form h1/S1(y) = y + s and h2/S2(y) = y + t.

Now deﬁne g = h ◦ f where

Notice that Πu

Now, by Proposition 3.6, we may choose s, t so that if q is a ﬁxed point

of

f (ˆx, ˆw1) ◦ ϕ ◦ Πs

then (cid:2)Πs

h2 ◦ l2.

Thus, by conjugacy with Πs

ˆl1 := Πs

g( ˆw1, ˆx) ◦ Πu

g (ˆp1, ˆw1) ◦ Πs

f ( ˆw2, ˆx)(cid:3)−1 (q) does not contain any ﬁxed point of

g(ˆx, ˆw1) we have that if q is a ﬁxed point of
g (ˆp1, ˆw1) ◦ Πs

g(ˆz1, ˆp1) ◦ Πu

g (ˆx, ˆz1) ◦ P1

then ϕ−1(q) does not contain any ﬁxed point of

ˆl2 := Πs

g( ˆw2, ˆx) ◦ Πu

g (ˆp2, ˆw2) ◦ Πs

g(ˆz2, ˆp2) ◦ Πu

g (ˆx, ˆz2) ◦ P2.

Now, let γ ∈ Γ, γ ⊂ V and let yγ, xγ as before. Then ˆl1(yγ) ∈ C0(xγ, g) =

C0(P1(yγ), g). So, if yγ is not ﬁxed by ˆl1, we have two possibilities: either

(1) ˆl1(yγ) <I1 yγ or
(2) ˆl1(yγ) >I1 yγ.

In case (1), ˆl1(yγ) cannot belong to γ by the deﬁnition of yγ and so C0(xγ, g)
is not contained in γ.

In case (2), we conclude that the point
g(ˆp1, ˆz1) ◦ Πu

g (ˆz1, ˆx) ◦ Πs

z := Πu

g ( ˆw1, ˆp1) ◦ Πs

g(ˆx, ˆw1)(yγ)

satisﬁes z <J1 xγ and so does not belong to γ which implies that C0(yγ, g) is
not contained in γ.

Finally, assume that yγ is ﬁxed by ˆl1 and let ¯xγ be the closest point of
γ ∩ I2 (in the order of I2) to x. Then we know that ¯yγ is not ﬁxed by ˆl2 and
we apply the previous argument. Thus, no curve γ ∈ Γ is an accessibility
class. The proof is ﬁnished.

4 Proof of Theorem 2

Let r ≥ 2 and let E be as in Theorem 2, i.e., E is E r, E r
sp,ω. We
have to prove the set R0 of diﬀeomorphisms in E having no trivial accessibility
classes is C 1 open and C r dense. This result is a consequence of Lemma 3.5,
as follows.

sp or E r

m, E r

ω, E r

Lets consider Γ0 : E → C(M) = {compact subsets of M} (endowed with

the Hausdorﬀ topology)

Γ0(f ) = {x ∈ M : AC(x) is trivial}.

(10)

We observe that Γ0(f ) is indeed a compact set, it follows from Corollary 2.11.

Lemma 4.1. The map Γ0 is upper semicontinuous, i.e., given f ∈ E and a
compact set K such that Γ0(f )∩K = ∅ then there exists a neighborhood U(f )
of f in E (which is also C 1 open) such that Γ0(g) ∩ K = ∅ for all g ∈ U(f ).

Proof. Let y /∈ Γ0(f ). From Corollary 2.12 there exist U(y) and Uy(f ) (which
is also C 1 open) such that for any g ∈ Uy(f ) and z ∈ U(y) we have that
AC(z, g) is non-trivial.

Now, consider the family of Uy with y ∈ K. We may cover K with ﬁnitely

many of them, say K ⊂Sn
Let U(f ) ⊂ Tn

If g ∈ U(f ) and z ∈ K then z ∈ Uyi and
g ∈ Uyi(f ) for some i and so AC(z, g) is non-trivial. The proof of the lemma
is complete.

i=1 Uyi(f ).

i=1 Uyi.

By taking K = M in the previous lemma, we get:

Corollary 4.2. If for some f ∈ E we have that Γ0(f ) = ∅ then there is a
neighborhood U(f ) ⊂ E (which is C 1 open) such that for any g ∈ U(f ) we
have Γ0(g) = ∅.

Now, we are ready to conclude:

Proof of Theorem 2. Let G0 be the set of continuity points of Γ0. This is a
residual set in E (since E with the C r topology is a Baire space). We claim
that if f ∈ G0 then Γ0(f ) = ∅. Otherwise, let x ∈ Γ0(f ) and we may assume
that x belongs to a periodic compact center leaf (see Lemma 2.4).

Indeed, by the continuity of Γ0 at f we have that for any neighborhood
V of x there exists U(f ) such that for any g ∈ U(f ) there is xg ∈ V such that
AC(xg, g) is trivial. A direct application of Lemma 3.5 yields a contradiction
and the claim is proved.

From this and Corollary 4.2 we get that the set

R0 = {f ∈ E : Γ0(f ) = ∅}

(11)

is C 1 open and C r dense in E. This set R0 is just the set of diﬀeomorphisms
where any accessibility class is nontrivial.

y ∈ F c

of p.

We say that a periodic point p as in the previous lemma satisﬁes the

Proof. Let Hn = {f ∈ E : all points in Fix(f n) are generic and every center-
hyperbolic periodic point p ∈ Fix(f n) of saddle type satisﬁes Property (L)}.
Claim: Hn is open and dense in E.
n = {f ∈
E : Fix(f n) generic} is open and dense in E. Thus, to prove the claim it
is enough to show that Hn is open and dense in H 0
n. It is immediate that Hn
is open in H 0
n. We know that
there are ﬁnitely many center-hyperbolic periodic points in Fix(f n). Choose

n. Let us show that Hn is dense. Let f ∈ H 0

In fact, notice that H 0

Lemma 3.5 it is not diﬃcult to get g ∈ Hn arbitrarily close to f satisfying
Property (L). Finally, set G1 = ∩n≥0Hn and the lemma is proved.

on a compact periodic center leaf F c

Theorem 5.2. There exists a residual subset R∗ in E such that if f ∈ R∗
and p is a periodic point which is neither a center-attractor nor a center-
repeller for f k
1 then C0(p, f ) is open.
Moreover, if p is center-hyperbolic of saddle type then there exist an open set
V in M (contained in a ball around p) and a neighborhood U(f ) (which is
also C 1 open) such that for any g ∈ U(f ), we have V ⊂ AC(pg, g) where pg
is the continuation of p for g ∈ U(f ).

/F c

1

Proof. Let R∗ = R0 ∩ G1 where R0 is as in Theorem 2 (see also (11)). Let
f ∈ R∗ and let p be a periodic point of f . Since f ∈ R∗, C0(p) := C0(p, f )
is either open or a one dimensional C 1-submanifold.

Assume ﬁrst that p is a center-elliptic periodic point of f k

of period
τ (p). Now, since C0(p) is invariant under f τ (p) and there is no invariant
direction of Df τ (p)

/F c(p) we easily conclude that C0(p) is open.

/F c

1

Assume now that p is a center-hyperbolic periodic point of f k

of saddle
type of period τ (p) and assume, by contradiction, that C0(p) is not open,
that is, C0(p) is a one dimensional C 1-submanifold. Then p satisﬁes Property
(L). This implies that there exist non trivial connected set C ⊂ C0(p, U, f ) ⊂
C0(p) and not contained in CW s

loc(p) ∪ CW u

loc(p).

/F c

On the other hand, TpC0(p) must be an invariant direction (by the in-
p . Assume that
p. Thus, C0(p) is locally a graph around p (via the exponential

and so TpC0(p) = CEs

variance of C0(p)) by Df τ (p)
TpC0(p) = CEs
map) of a map from CEs

p or CEu

p

p → CEu
p .

Now, this graph is not contained in CW s

loc(p) (since p satisﬁes Prop-
erty (L) and the connected set C ⊂ C0(p, U, f )). But notice that this graph
is locally invariant, by the invariance of C0(p). This is a contradiction since
there is a unique locally invariant graph, namely CW s
loc(p). Analogously, if
p we use the same argument for f −1. Thus, we have proved
TpC0(p) = CEu
that C0(p) is open.

As the accessibility class C0(p) of a center-hyperbolic periodic point of
loc(p) intersect C0(p) then,

saddle type p is open and that CW s
by invariance we get that CW s(p) and CW u(p) are contained in C0(p).

loc(p) and CW u

From Property (L), we know that there exists yf ∈ Uc \ CW s
loc(p) ∪
loc(p) so that yf ∈ C0(p, U, f ). Lets order the four connected component

CW u
clockwise beginning with the one that contains yf . See Figure 8.

Let Bc(yf ) be a ball centered in yf contained in Uc\(CW s

loc(p)∪CW u

that is, Bc(yf ) ⊂ (I).

We know (see Lemma 2.7) that there exists a continuous map γ : Bc(p) ×

loc(p)) ⊂ C0(p) and so

loc(p) ∪ CW u

we have for some t0 that γ(z, t0) ∈ (CW s
Vc ⊂ C0(p).

Finally, we saturate Vc by local (strong) stable and unstable manifolds
to obtain an open set V ⊂ M. This set V satisﬁes the requirement of the
theorem for U(f ) small enough by the continuation of center leaves, strong
stable and unstable leaves, the continuation of p, and the continuation of γ
and that Property (L) is open. The theorem is proved.

Let f ∈ R∗ and let p be a center-hyperbolic periodic point of saddle type
(belonging to a periodic compact center leaf). Let U(f ) corresponding to p

Notice that Γ1 is well deﬁned since AC(pg, g) is open for g ∈ U(f ).

Proposition 5.3. The map Γ1 is upper semicontinuous, i.e., given g ∈ U(f )
and a compact set K such that Γ1(g)∩K = ∅ then there exists a neighborhood
V(g) ⊂ U(f ) (which is also C 1 open) such that for any h ∈ V(g) we have
that Γ1(h) ∩ K = ∅.

29

Proof. Let V be the ﬁxed open set in M from Theorem 5.2, that is, V ⊂
AC(pg, g) for every g ∈ U(f ). Let g ∈ U(f ) and K compact with Γ1(g)∩K =
∅ be given. Let y ∈ K, then there exists Uy and Uy(g) such that for any
h ∈ Uy(g) and any z ∈ Uy we have that AC(z, h)∩V 6= ∅ (see Corollary 2.12),
in other words Uy ⊂ AC(ph, h) for any h ∈ Uy(g).

Now, cover K with ﬁnitely many of these open sets Uy, that is, K ⊂
i=1 Uyi(g). Then, for every h ∈ V(g) we have that

Sn
i=1 Uyi. Let V(g) = Tn

K ⊂ AC(ph, h). The proof of proposition in ﬁnished.

Corollary 5.4. Assume that for g ∈ U(f ) we have that Γ1(g) = ∅, then g
is accessible. Moreover, there exists V(g) (which is also C 1 open) such that
any h ∈ V(g) is accessible.

A or E r

A,m and with dim Ec = 2, that is, the set of E r
Let E be either E r
m where dim Ec = 2 and supporting a Center Axiom-A. Let R0 be as
or E r
in Theorem 2 and R∗ as in Theorem 5.2 (both restricted to E r
A,m).
Thus, R0 ∩ R∗ is residual in E. Let f ∈ R0 ∩ R∗ (although in the proof of
Theorem 5.2 we construct R∗ ⊂ R0). We will prove that f is accessible. Lets
see the properties we know for f :

A or E r

• Any accessibility class is nontrivial.

• The accessibility classes of center-hyperbolic periodic points of saddle

type of f are open.

• If p is a center-hyperbolic periodic point of saddle type, then it satisﬁes

Property (L).

• There exists a compact periodic center leaf F c

is an
Axiom-A diﬀeomorphism without having both periodic attractor and
periodic repellers, where k is the period of F c
1. We will assume for
simplicity that it has no attractors.

1 such that f k

/F c

• If p is center-hyperbolic periodic point of saddle type, then the stable
and unstable manifolds in the center leaf CW s(p) and CW u(p) are
contained in the accessibility class of p.

/F c

Lets denote by Λ a basic piece of f k

which is not a periodic center-
repeller. Recall that the stable and unstable manifolds CW s(O(p)) and
CW u(O(p)) are dense in Λ for any periodic point p ∈ Λ. Let x ∈ Λ be any
point. We know that C0(x) is open or a one dimensional C 1 manifold without
boundary containing x. In any case, we have that it intersects CW s(O(p))
or CW u(O(p)) and therefore C0(x) ∩ C0(f i(p)) 6= ∅ for some i. Therefore,
C0(x) = C0f i(p). This means that Λ is contained in ∪q∈O(p)C0(q) for p ∈ Λ
periodic. By the invariance of ∪q∈O(p)C0(q) we also have that CW s(Λ) and

30

CW u(Λ) are contained in ∪q∈O(p)C0(q). Let F0 be the set of periodic center-
repellers which is a ﬁnite set. Let F1 be the set of center-hyperbolic periodic
points of saddle type. Since there are no periodic center-attractor we have
that Per(f/F c

1 ) = F0 ∪ F1.

Since every point in F c

1 is contained in the stable manifold (inside the
center leaf) of the basic pieces, we conclude that F c
1 \ F0 ⊂ ∪p∈F1C0(p) and
that C0(p) is open for any periodic point in F1. By connectedness we conclude
that F c
1 \ F0 ⊂ C0(p) (for any periodic point p ∈ F1). Since the accessibility
classes are non trivial for every q ∈ F0, we have that C0(q) ∩ C0(p) 6= ∅ and
so C0(q) = C0(p). Thus F c
1 = C0(p) for any p ∈ F1. That is, the center leaf
F c
1 is just one center accessibility class and by Lemma 2.4 we have that f is
accessible, as we claimed.

Finally, since f ∈ R∗ and ﬁxing a center-hyperbolic periodic point of
saddle type p of f , in the setting of Section 5, we have a neighborhood
U(f ) and a map Γ1 deﬁned in U(f ). Due to what we just proved Γ1(f ) = ∅
holds and so by Corollary 5.4 there exists U0(f ) such that any g ∈ U0(f ) is
accessible. Thus,

R1 = [f ∈R0∩R∗

U0(f )

is C 1 open and C r dense in E and formed by accessible diﬀeomorphisms.
This completes the proof of Theorem 3.

6.1 Examples

We present here some examples where Theorem 3 applies.

Example 1. This example can be thought as a conservative version of the
well known Shub’s example on T4 ([Shu71]).

Consider the Lewowicz family (see [Lew80]) of conservative diﬀeomor-

phisms on T2 :

fc(x, y) =(cid:16)2x −

c
2π

sin 2πx + y, x −

c
2π

sin 2π + y(cid:17) , c ∈ R.

Notice that when c = 0 fc is Anosov and when 1 < c < 5 the ﬁxed point at
(0, 0) is an elliptic ﬁxed point. We just consider for instance c ∈ [0, 2]. From
this family it is not diﬃcult to construct a continuous map

g : T2 → Diﬀ∞(T2)

such that for two points p, q ∈ T2 given, we have g(p) = f0 and g(q) = f2.
Now, given r ≥ 2, consider a conservative Anosov diﬀeomorphism A : T2 →
T2 having p, q ∈ T2 as ﬁxed points and with enough strong expansion and
contraction so the map

F : T2 × T2 → T2 × T2 deﬁned as F (x, y) = (A(x), gx(y))

31

belongs to E r
A,m(T2 ×T2). The center foliation is thus {x}×T2 and at F c(p) =
{p} × T2 the map F supports an Anosov (and hence an Axiom-A without
having both periodic attractors and repellers). Our theorem implies that a
generic arbitrarily small C r perturbation (preserving the Lebesgue measure
on T2 × T2) is stably ergodic. The same example can be considered also just
in the skew-product setting.

Remark 6.1. Notice that due to the presence of an elliptic point on {q}× T2
the center bundle Ec does not admit any dominated splitting. By the result in
[BFP06] we may ﬁnd a perturbation of F (and stably ergodic) such that the
center Lyapunov exponent is nonzero. This implies that the center foliation
(which is two dimensional) is not absolutely continuous.

Theorem 3 admits some generalizations or diﬀerent versions. We just give

some examples and an idea of how to prove stable ergodicity.

Example 2. Consider f : T2 → T2 a conservative Anosov diﬀeomorphism
and let F0 : T2 × S1 → T2 × S1 as F0 = f × id. This is a conservative
partially hyperbolic diﬀeomorphism on T3 with one dimensional center and
the center foliation is by circles. Let p be a ﬁxed point of f. It is not dif-
ﬁcult to construct a (conservative) perturbation F of F0 such that on the
corresponding F c(p, F ) the dynamics is a north-south Morse-Smale dynam-
ics and F satisﬁes the same generic conditions as in Theorem 3. Then, the
map F × F : T6 → T6 belongs to E r
m(T6), the center foliation is by T2 and
F/F c(p,p) is an Axiom-A diﬀeomorphism (the product of the two Morse-Smale
on the circle). Theorem 3 does not apply in this case because F/F c(p,p) have
a center-attracting and a center-repelling periodic point. Nevertheless, by
the similar arguments as in the proof of Theorem 3 one gets that the union
of the accessibility classes of the two center-hyperbolic saddles in F c(p, p)
is open and if it is not the whole center leaf F c(p, p) then its complement
consist of a closed C 1 curve which is a connection between the attractor and
the repeller. Since this curve does not separate the leaf F c(p, p) we have that
the union of the accessibility classes of the two center-hyperbolic saddles is
just one accessibility class C0(q), for q any periodic saddle, which is open and
AC(q) has full measure in T6. This means that F is essentially accessible
and hence ergodic. Since the above situation is C r open we conclude that F
is C r stably ergodic.

The same argument also applies to next example.

Example 3. Consider f0 : M → M to be the time one map of the suspen-
sion of a conservative Anosov diﬀeomorphisms on T2. This is a conservative
partially hyperbolic diﬀeomorphism whose leaves of the center foliation are
the orbits of the suspension. Let p be a ﬁxed point of the Anosov and the
center leaf F c(p, f0) is a circle where f0 is the identity. We then ﬁnd a con-
servative and generic perturbation f of f0 such that f restricted to F c(p, f )
is a Morse-Smale system. The diﬀeomorphism f × f : M × M → M × M

32

belongs to E r
m(M × M) with two dimensional center leaves and in the leaf
F c((p, p), f × f ) is an Axiom-A on a two torus and in the same situation as
the previous example. The same argument yields that f ×f is stably ergodic.

7 Proof of Theorem 4

In this section we denote by E either E r
key fact about preserving a symplectic form ω in E r
result (see [XZ06, Lemma 2.5]):

ω or E r

sp,ω and with dim Ec = 2. The
ω is the following folklore

Lemma 7.1. Let f : M → M be a partially hyperbolic diﬀeomorphism
preserving a symplectic form ω. Then ω/E c is non degenerated (and so sym-
plectic). In particular if f is dynamically coherent and dim Ec = 2 then ω
is an area form in F c(x) for any x. Furthermore, if F c(x) is k-periodic then
f k
/F c(x) is a conservative diﬀeomorphism.

Throughout this section in order to simplify notation we omit the word
center when we refer to the classiﬁcation of periodic point in a center leaf in
Section 5.

The next lemma says that generically we have compact leaves with peri-

odic points.

Lemma 7.2. There exists a C 1 open and C r dense set G2 in E such that if
f ∈ G2 then there exists a periodic compact leaf having a hyperbolic periodic
point.

Proof. Notice that the set in E having a hyperbolic periodic point on some
compact periodic leaf is C 1 open.

Let f0 ∈ E and let F c

1 is not the two torus then f0/F c

1 be a compact periodic leaf. For simplicity we
assume it is ﬁxed. We may assume also that F c
1 is orientable (otherwise we
go to the double covering). If F c
1 has periodic
points. Let f ∈ E be a Kupka-Smale diﬀeomorphism and arbitrarily C r
close to f0. It follows that there is a hyperbolic periodic point in F c
1(f ) since
once we have elliptic periodic points we have hyperbolic periodic points (see
[Zeh73]).
If F c

1, then by
composing with a translation in the torus (and extending this perturbation
on F c
1 to M) we may change the mean rotation number (the mean rotation
number of the composition of two maps is the sum of the mean rotation
number of each one) to get a rational mean rotation number. Using a result
by Franks [Fra88] we get a periodic point, which by perturbation we may
assume that it is hyperbolic or elliptic. And then we argue as before.

1 is the two torus and f0 has no periodic points in F c

Remark 7.3. In this situation we are working with (E r
sp,ω), if p is a
hyperbolic periodic point of f then for the restriction to the center manifold
that contains p we have that p is a hyperbolic periodic point of saddle type
(since the restriction to the center manifold preserves area).

ω or E r

Let R0 from Theorem 2, and let KS be the set ok Kupka-Smale diﬀeo-
morphisms in E which is a residual set, and let R∗ as in Theorem 5.2. We
consider

f ∈ R0 ∩ R∗ ∩ G2 ∩ KS

(13)

and let F c
point p, F c

1 be a compact k-periodic leaf containing a hyperbolic periodic
1 = F c(p). Let Γ1 as in (12).

Let U(f ) be as in Theorem 5.2. Let ˜R ⊂ U(f ) be the residual subset of

continuity points of Γ1 (as deﬁned in (12)).

We will assume for simplicity that the compact leaf S = F c(p, f ) is ﬁxed
by f. When g varies on U(f ) the compact leaf F c(pg, g) varies continuously
(by a homeomorphism on M close to the identity), and thus there is a natural
identiﬁcation between F c(pg, g) with F c(p, f ) as the surface S. In order to
avoid unimportant technicalities we will assume that F c(pg, g) = S for any
g ∈ U(f ). Now consider the following maps Γ2, Γ3 : U(f ) → C(S), where
C(S) is the set of compact subset of S with the Hausdorﬀ topology:

Γ2(g) = S \ C0(pg, g)

and

Γ3(g) = C0(pg, g),

(14)

where C0(pg, g) is the connected component of C(pg, g) that contains pg.

Lemma 7.4. The map Γ2 is upper semicontinuous and the map Γ3 is lower
semicontinuous. That is, given g ∈ U(f ), a compact set K ⊂ S and an open
set U ⊂ S such that K ∩ Γ2(g) = ∅ and U ∩ Γ3(g) 6= ∅ then there exists U(g)
such that K ∩ Γ2(h) = ∅ and U ∩ Γ3(h) 6= ∅ for any h ∈ U(g).

Proof. The proof that Γ2 is upper semicontinuous is similar as the proof of
Proposition 5.3. Let V ′ = V ∩ S where V is as in Theorem 5.2 and let
K ⊂ S a compact set as in statement, that is K ⊂ C0(pg, g). Let y ∈ K.
There exists Uy ⊂ S and Uy(g) such that for any z ∈ Uy and h ∈ Uy(g)
we have that AC(z, h) ∩ V ′
6= ∅. On the other hand we can assume that
Uy ⊂ C0(pg, g) and this means that the su-path (of g) joining z ∈ Uy with V ′
when lifted to the covering ˜M is a path that starts and ends on a same center
leaf (which projects to S) and so the same happens for h near g. This implies
that Uy ⊂ C0(ph, h) for any h ∈ Uy(g). Then, covering K with ﬁnitely many
sets Uy and taking the corresponding intersection of the Uy(g) we conclude
the statement on Γ2.

Lets prove the semicontinuity of Γ3. Let U ⊂ S be an open set such that
U ∩ Γ3(g) 6= ∅. In particular U ∩ C0(pg, g) 6= ∅. Let y be in this intersection
and let Uy and Uy(g) as before. We may assume that Uy ⊂ U. Then, for any
h ∈ Uy(g) we have that Uy ⊂ C0(ph, h) and so U ∩ Γ3(h) 6= ∅.

Let R2(f ) and R3(f ) be the sets of continuity points of Γ2 and Γ3 respec-

tively. These are residual subsets of U(f ). We set

RU (f ) = R0 ∩ G2 ∩ R∗ ∩ ˜R ∩ R2(f ) ∩ R3(f ) ∩ KS ∩ U(f ),

(15)

which is a residual subset of U(f ). The next result implies our Theorem 4.

34

Theorem 7.5. Let g ∈ RU (f ). Then C0(pg, g) = F c(pg, g), i.e., g is accessi-
ble.

Indeed, for any f as in (13) we consider RU (f ) as in (15) and we set

R =

[f ∈R0∩R∗∩G2∩KS

RU (f ).

It follows that R is residual (and hence C r dense) in E and every g ∈ R is
accessible from Theorem 7.5. On the other hand, Corollary 5.4 implies that
the accessible ones are C 1 open.

The rest of the section is thus devoted to prove Theorem 7.5.

Lemma 7.6. Let g ∈ U(f ) and let K be a connected component of the
boundary ∂C0(pg, g). Then, for every x ∈ K we have that C0(x) ⊂ K.

Proof. Let x ∈ K and let y ∈ C0(x) and assume that y /∈ K. Since C0(x) is
connected, we may assume, without loss of generality, that y /∈ ∂C0(pg, g).
Therefore, since y cannot belong to C0(pg), we have that y /∈ C0(pg).

On the other hand we know (by Lemma 2.7 and Remark 2.8) there is a
continuous map γ : Bx → By, such that for any z ∈ Bx, γ(z) ∈ C0(z), where
Bx and By are small neighborhoods x and y, respectively, and we may take
By ⊂ F c(pg, g)\ C0(pg). Since x ∈ ∂C0(pg) then we may take z ∈ Bx ∩C0(pg)
and hence γ(z) ∈ C0(pg) ∩ By, a contradiction.

Remark 7.7. Let K be a connected component of ∂C0(pg, g). Then K has
no periodic point. This is because K has empty interior and we know that
for any periodic point q of g, C0(q, g) is open.

Lemma 7.8. Let g ∈ RU (f ) and let h ∈ U(f ) such that h = g in F c(pg, g).
Then there is no periodic point of h in ∂C0(ph, h).

Proof. Assume, by contradiction, that there exists a periodic point q ∈
∂C0(ph, h), q ∈ K a connected component of ∂C0(ph, h). Since h = g on
F c(pg, g) = F c(ph, h) we have that q is a periodic point of g and hence q
is either elliptic or hyperbolic (for g/F c(pg,g) and thus for h/F c(pg,g)). If q is
elliptic then we know that C0(q, h) is open and we get a contradiction.

Assume that q is hyperbolic. If C0(q, h) is open we are done. If not, we
know that CW s(q) ⊂ C0(q, h) or CW u(q) ⊂ C0(q, h). For instance, assume
that CW s(q) ⊂ C0(q, h). Since h = g on F c(pg, g) then every periodic point
of h in F c(pg, g) is elliptic nondegenerated or hyperbolic and there is no saddle
connections (since g is KS). A theorem of J. Mather in [Mat81, Theorem 5.2]
implies that CW u(q) ⊂ CW s(q) ⊂ C0(q, h) ⊂ K. We know that there exists
a continuous map γ : B(q)×[0, 1] → F c(pg, g) such that γ(q, ·) ⊂ CW s
loc(q, h),
γ(q, ·) is not constant and for every z ∈ B(q), γ(z, t) ∈ C0(z, h). Therefore,
for z belonging to an appropriate component of B(q) \ (CW s
loc(q))
we have that γ(z, tz) ∈ CW u
loc(q) for some tz and so z ∈ K.

This implies that K has nonempty interior, a contradiction.

Proposition 7.9. Let h ∈ U(f ) and let K be a connected component of
∂C0(ph, h). Then, the partition of K by connected component of accessibility
classes form a C 1 lamination.

Proof. It is a direct consequence of Corollary 2.20.

We need a general result about C 1 lamination of subsets of the plane.

Proposition 7.10. Let K ⊂ R2 be a compact and connected set with empty
interior and supporting a C 1 lamination. Then

1. R2 \ K has at least two connected components, and

2. if R2 \ K has exactly two connected component then K ∼= S1.

Proof. If K contains a leaf which is diﬀeomorphic to a circle then clearly K
separates R2. On the other hand, if K does not contains such a leaf then by
[FO96], R2 \ K has at least four connected components, this proves item 1.
Now, if R2 \ K has exactly two connected components, by the above it
follows that K contains a leaf W0 that is diﬀeomorphic to a circle, which is
unique otherwise the complement has at least three connected components.
Arguing by contradiction, assume that there are other leaves of the lamina-
tion than W0.

Let W (x) be the leaf of lamination through x ∈ K. Orientate the leaf
in an arbitrary way. It follows that the α and ω limit set of the leaf must
contain W0. Otherwise, the result of [FO96] applies and the complement of
K has at least four connected components.

Consider a transversal section J through W0. By the above, every point
in K \ J is in an arc of the lamination having both ends in J. The same ar-
guments in the paper of [FO96] yields that the lamination could be extended
to a foliation with singularities in the sphere having at most one singular-
ity of index 1 and the others have index less than 1/2. It follows that the
complement of K has at least 3 connected components, a contradiction.

We now state a theorem that will be useful in our context.

36

Theorem 7.11 (Xia [Xia06], Koropecki [Kor10]). Let S be a compact surface
without boundary and let f : S → S be a homeomorphism such that Ω(f ) = S.
Let K be a compact connected invariant set. Then, one of the following holds:

1. K has a periodic point;

2. K = S = T2;

3. K is an annular domain, i.e., there exists an open neighborhood U of
K homeomorphic to an annulus and U \ K has exactly two components
(each one homeomorphic to an annulus).

Proposition 7.12. Let g ∈ RU (f ) and let h ∈ U(f ) such that h = g on
F c(pg, g). Then, any connected component K of ∂C0(ph, h) is a simple closed
C 1-curve invariant for some power of h (and g).

Proof. Let K be a connected component of ∂C0(ph, h). By Proposition 7.9
we know that K admits a C 1 lamination. We have three possibilities:

(1) K ⊂ U where U is homeomorphic to a disk and K does not separate

U;

(2) K ⊂ U where U is homeomorphic to a disk and K does separate U;

(3) none of the above, i.e., in any neighborhood U of K we have non null-

homotopic closed curves (in F c(ph, h)).

Proposition 7.10 implies that (1) cannot happen. Lets consider situation
(2). We consider an open set U0 ⊂ U, where U0 is a connected component
of the complement of C0(ph, h) and ∂U0 ⊂ K. Since h|F c(ph, h) preserves
the form ω|F c(ph, h) we have for some integer m that hm(U0) = U0. This
implies that hm(K) ∩ K 6= ∅. From the fact that C0(ph, h) is invariant we get
hm(K) = K. Since K has no periodic point (from Lemma 7.8) and is not
the whole surface, we have from Theorem 7.11 that K is an annular domain
and by Proposition 7.10, we have that K is a simple closed curve.

Finally, lets consider situation (3). Notice that there are ﬁnitely many
components satisfying (3). On the other hand, h maps a connected compo-
nent K satisfying (3), to another one also satisfying (3). Therefore, for some
m we have that hm(K) = K, for any K in (3). Applying Theorem 7.11 and
Proposition 7.10, we get the result as before.

Lemma 7.13. Let g ∈ RU (f ). Then C0(pg, g) = F c(pg, g).

Proof. Assume that this is not the case, and so, there is a connected compo-
nent C of ∂C0(pg, g) (which is a simple closed curve) and an open annulus U
which is a neighborhood of C, such that one component of U \ C ⊂ C0(pg, g)
and the other one is contained in the complement of C0(pg, g). We know that
gm(C) = C for some m.

37

Consider the family Γ of gm invariant simple closed and essential C 1-
curve in U. Notice that curves in this family are disjoint or coincide. This is
because, since g is KS, these curves cannot have rational rotation number.
Now, if C1 ∩ C2 6= ∅, by invariance we have that they intersects along the non-
wandering set Ω(gm|C1) = Ω(gm|C2). But if one (and hence both) are Denjoy
maps there must exists a wandering open set U ⊂ F c(pg, g), a contradiction
since g preserves area on the compact leaf F c(pg, g).

Let V ⊂ V ⊂ U be an annulus neighborhood of C as in Lemma 3.7. Since
g ∈ RU (f ) and in particular g is a continuity point of the maps Γ2 and Γ3
(see (14)) it is not diﬃcult to see that there exists V(g) such that if h ∈ V(g)
and h = g on F c(pg, g) then ∂C0(ph, h) must have a connected component
in V which must be an hm-invariant (and so gm-invariant) essential simple
closed C 1-curve. By Lemma 3.7 we get a contradiction.

Now we are ready to ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 7.5 and hence Theorem 4.

End of proof of Theorem 7.5: Let g ∈ RU (f ) and we already know that
C0(pg, g) = F c(pg, g). We want to prove that C0(pg, g) = F c(pg, g). We
argue by contradiction and we assume that C0(pg, g) 6= F c(pg, g) and let
Ci = Ci(g), i = 1, . . . , ℓ be the connected components of ∂C0(pg, g). We know
that every Ci is a simple closed C 1-curve non null-homotopic invariant for
gmi, for some mi and let Ui be annulus neighborhoods of Ci.

Since g is a continuity point of Γ2 and Γ3 we get that there exists a

neighborhood V(g) such that if h ∈ V(g) then

• C0(ph, h) = F c(ph, h).

• F c(ph, h) \ C0(ph, h) ∩ Ui 6= ∅, i = 1, . . . , ℓ.

Consider the family of essential simple closed C 1-curves gm-invariant and
contained in Ui and let Vi be as in Lemma 3.7. Since g ∈ RU (f ) and for
V(g) as above we have for any h ∈ V(g) and such that h = g on F c(pg, g)
that ∂C0(ph, h) must have a connected components Ci(h) (which are simple
closed curves) contained in every Vi. By Lemma 3.7 this curves cannot
be essential in Vi . This implies that Ci(h) must be null-homotopic. And
therefore C0(ph, h) 6= F c(ph, h), a contradiction.
(cid:3)

A Proof of Proposition 3.6

A.1 Bounded Variation

Recall that f : [a, b] → R is of bounded variation if :

sup(n−1Xi=0

|f (xi+1) − f (xi)| : a = x0 < x1 < · · · < xn = b) < ∞,

and this supremum is denoted by V (f ; [a, b]).

38

Lemma A.1. Let f : [a, b] → R of bounded variation. We have the following:

1. if [a1, b1] ⊂ [a, b] then V (f ; [a1, b1]) ≤ V (f ; [a, b]),

2. if (a1, b1) and (a2, b2) are disjoint intervals contained in [a, b] then
V (f ; [a1, b1]) + V (f ; [a2, b2]) ≤ V (f ; [a, b]). The same holds for any
ﬁnite disjoint collection of intervals (ai, bi)’s,

3. if (a1, b1) and (a2, b2) are disjoint intervals in [a, b] and f ([a1, b1]) ∪
f ([a2, b2]) ⊃ [c, d] then V (f ; [a1, b1]) + V (f ; [a2, b2]) ≥ d − c. A similar
statement holds for any ﬁnite disjoint collection of (ai, bi)’s,

4. if f is the diﬀerence of two non-decreasing maps then f is of bounded

variation.

Proof. We just prove item 3, the others follows immediately from the deﬁni-
tion of bounded variation. Lets assume that c ∈ f ([a1, b1]). If d ∈ f ([a1, b1])
then we are done. So, assume that d /∈ f ([a1, b1]) and so d ∈ f ([a2, b2]).
Let c∗ = sup(f ([a1, b1])) and d∗ = inf(f ([a1, b1])) then c∗ ≥ d∗, c∗ ≥ c, and
d∗ ≤ d. Then V (f ; [a1, b1]) ≥ c∗ − c and V (f ; [a2, b2]) ≥ d − d∗. Then,

V (f ; [a1, b1]) + V (f ; [a2, b2]) ≥ (d − d∗) + (c∗ − c) ≥ d − c.

By induction, we prove the statement for ﬁnite collections of intervals.

A.2 Proof of Proposition 3.6

Lets state it again for simplicity:

Let ℓ1 : [−a, a] → R and ℓ2 : [−b, b] → R be two non-decreasing maps and
let φ : [−b, b] → [−a, a] be also a non-decreasing map. Then for any ε > 0
there exist s, t, |s|, |t| ≤ ε, such that :

φ({x ∈ [−b, b] : ℓ2(x) + t = x}) ∩ {x ∈ [−a, a] : ℓ1(x) + s = x} = ∅.

For a non-decreasing map f : [a, b] → R and y ∈ [a, b] we denote by
f−(y) = limxրy f (x) and f+(y) = limxցy f (x). We say that f : [a, b] → R
has a jump in z ∈ (a, b) if f−(z) 6= f+(z) (i.e., if z is a discontinuity point of
f ). Moreover, we say that f has a jump of size ε if f has a jump in some z
such that |f−(z) − f+(z)| ≥ ε.

Lemma A.2. Let f : [a, b] → R be non-decreasing. Then, for any ε > 0
there is δ > 0 such that if 0 < y − x < δ then either f (y) − f (x) < ε or there
exists a jump of size ε/2 between x and y.

Proof. By contradiction, suppose that there is ε0 > 0 such that for any δ > 0,
there exist xδ, yδ such that 0 < yδ − xδ < δ and f (yδ) − f (xδ) ≥ ε0, and there
is no jump of size ε0/2.

39

Let (xn) and (yn) be two sequences such that 0 < yn − xn < 1/n and
f (yn) − f (xn) ≥ ε0, and there is no jump of size ε0/2 between xn and yn, for
every n. Let x be an accumulation point of {xn}. Since f is non-decreasing,
we may assume that xn approaches x from the left (otherwise lim f (yn) −
f (xn) = f+(x) − f+(x) = 0). We may assume then that xn ր x. By the
same argument, we have that {yn} has to approach x from the right, and
we may assume that and so yn ց x. Thus, f+(x) − f−(x) ≥ ε0, which is a
contradiction, since xn ≤ x ≤ yn.

Let g1 : [−a, a] → R deﬁned by g1 = ℓ1(x) − x and g2 : [−b, b] → R deﬁned

by g2 = ℓ2(x) − x. Notice that, g1, g2 are of bounded variation and that

{x : ℓ1(x) + s = x} = g−1

1 (s)

and

{x : ℓ2(x) + t = x} = g−1

2 (s).

Lemma A.3. For any s1 < s2 the following hold:

1. φ−1(g−1

1 (s1)) ∩ φ−1(g−1

1 (s2)) contains at most ﬁnitely many points.

2. For any y in the above intersection there exists δ > 0 such that either

a) (y − δ, y) ∩ φ−1(g−1
b) (y − δ, y) ∩ φ−1(g−1

1 (s1)) = ∅ and (y, y + δ) ∩ φ−1(g−1
1 (s2)) = ∅ and (y, y + δ) ∩ φ−1(g−1

1 (s2)) = ∅ or
1 (s1)) = ∅.

1 (s1)) ∩ φ−1(g−1

1 (s2)). Observe that φ−1(g−1

Proof. Let y ∈ φ−1(g−1
1 (s1)) ∩
φ−1(g−1
1 (s2)) = ∅. We claim that y cannot be accumulated at one side
(either right or left) by both sets φ−1(g−1
1 (s2)). Otherwise,
assume this for the left, let xn ր y, xn ∈ φ−1(g−1
1 (s1)) and zn ր y, zn ∈
φ−1(g−1
1 (s2)). Then, φ(xn) ր φ−(y) and φ(zn) ր φ−(y). Hence, s1 =
g1(φ(xn)) = ℓ1(φ(xn))−φ(xn) and so s1 = (ℓ1)−(φ−(y))−φ−(y). Analogously,
s2 = g1(φ(zn)) = ℓ1(φ(zn)) − φ(zn) and so s2 = (ℓ1)−(φ−(y)) − φ−(y), a
contradiction since s1 6= s2. This proves item 2.

1 (s1)) and φ−1(g−1

To prove item 1, lets assume that for y in the intersection situation (a)
holds. Then s2 = (ℓ1)−(φ−(y)) − φ−(y) and s1 = (ℓ1)+(φ+(y)) − φ+(y). So,
(ℓ1)+(φ+(y)) = s1 + φ+(y) and (ℓ1)+(φ−(y)) = s2 + φ−(y). Since φ(y) ≤
φ+(y) and ℓ1 is non-decreasing then (ℓ1)+(φ−(y)) ≤ (ℓ1)+(φ+(y)). Then,
s1 + φ+(y) ≥ s2 + φ−(y). Therefore,

φ+(y) − φ−(y) ≥ s2 − s1.

This means that the jump of φ at y is at least of size s2 − s1 and there are
at most ﬁnitely many of them. The proof is complete in this case.

Now, assume that (b) holds and so s1 = (ℓ1)−(φ−(y)) − φ−(y) and s2 =
(ℓ1)+(φ+(y)) − φ+(y). Let ε = s2 − s1 and let δ (< ε) from Lemma A.2
applied to ℓ1. Notices that

(ℓ1)+(φ+(y))−(ℓ1)−(φ−(y)) = s2 + φ+(y) − s1 − φ−(y)
= (s2 − s1) + φ+(y)) − φ−(y) ≥ s2 − s1.

40

If y is a continuity point of φ then we have a ℓ1-jump of size s2 − s1 at
φ(y) = φ+(y) = φ−(y) and there can be just ﬁnitely many of them. On the
other hand, there can be ﬁnitely many y’s such that the φ-jump at y is at
least δ. So, we just consider the set of y’s such that φ+(y) − φ−(y) < δ. By
Lemma A.2 there exists a ℓ1-jump in [φ−(y), φ+(y)] of size at least ε/2. For
diﬀerent y’s the intervals [φ−(y), φ+(y)] are disjoint. Since there are ﬁnitely
many ℓ1-jumps of size at least ε/2, we conclude that there are ﬁnitely many
y’s in

φ−1(g−1

1 (s1)) ∩ φ−1(g−1

1 (s2))

and the lemma is proved.

Now we can prove Proposition 3.6.

Proof of Proposition 3.6. Recall that g1(x) = ℓ1(x)−x and g2(x) = ℓ2(x)−x.
Assume, by contradiction, that for some ε > 0 we have that for any s, t,
|s|, |t| ≤ ε we have

φ({x ∈ [−b, b] : ℓ2(x) + t = x}) ∩ {x ∈ [−a, a] : ℓ1(x) + s = x} 6= ∅.

We know that g2 is of bounded variation, set M = V (g2; [−b, b]) and let k
be an integer, k > M/(2ε). Consider a partition of [−ε, ε] −ε ≤ s1 < s2 <
· · · < sk ≤ ε, and let Si = φ−1(g−1
1 (si)). Notice that from our contradicting
assumption that g2(Si) ⊃ [−ε, ε]. From Lemma A.3 we have that Si ∩ Sj
contains at most ﬁnitely many points for i 6= j. And if i 6= j 6= l 6= i then
Si ∩ Sj ∩ Sl = ∅.

Let y1, . . . , ym be the set of points that belongs to more than one Si. For
each yi let δi from Lemma A.3 such that (yi − δi, yi) intersects just one of the
sets Sj, j = 1, . . . , k, and the same for (yi, yi + δi).

(yi − δi, yi + δi)#c
LetbSj = Sj∩" M[i=1
. The setsbSj, j = 1, . . . , k are compact
mj[l=1
and disjoints. For each j, choose bUj =
[al, bl] such that bSj ⊂ bUj and
bUj ∩bUi = ∅ if j 6= i.
Uj = bUj ∪ [i : Sj∩[yi−δ,yi]6=∅
[yi − δi, yi] ∪
[yi, yi + δi] .

[i : Sj∩[yi,yi+δ]6=∅

Let

We can write Uj as a union of ﬁnitely many compact and disjoint intervals
Ij(1), . . . , Ij(mj).

Now, we have :

· g2(Uj) ⊃ [−ε, ε] for any j = 1, . . . , k; and

· int(Uj) ∩ int(Ul) = ∅ if j 6= l.

41

Therefore, we have

V (g2; Ij(i)) ≥ 2ε,

mXi=1

and so, from Lemma A.1, we get

V (g2; [−b, b]) ≥

kXj=1

mXi=1

V (g2; Ij(i)) ≥ k2ε > M ≥ V (g2; [−b, b]),

a contradiction. This completes the proof.
