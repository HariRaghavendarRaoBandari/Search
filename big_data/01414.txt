polarized transversal electromagnetic waves. Here we present the formalism, provide some examples
and compare with standard measures of polarization and coherence of vectorial waves.

INTRODUCTION

II. SETTINGS: FIELD STATES AND

COHERENCE MEASURES

Coherence is a basic physical property that emerges
in very diﬀerent contexts, from classical optics to quan-
tum mechanics. Therefore the eﬀorts to ﬁnd a proper
measure of coherence seem justiﬁed, specially after its
identiﬁcation as a resource [1].

In this work we focus on the assessment of the co-
herence conveyed by pairs of partially polarized electro-
magnetic beams in classical optics. Coherence has two
extreme physical manifestations: interference, as coher-
ence when superimposing beams with the same vibra-
tional state, and polarization, as coherence when super-
imposing beams with orthogonal vibration states. This
makes specially attractive the analysis of coherence in
the superposition of partially polarized waves. The com-
plexity of the subject has motivated the introduction of
complementary approaches focusing on diﬀerent perspec-
tives [2–4]. Among them, it makes sense to address the
idea of global conference embracing both interference and
polarization at once [5, 6]. Parallels can also be drawn to
its quantum counterpart through the idea of state purity
[7–9].

Besides standard measures, entropies are in general
good candidates to asses statistical properties. Entropy
has already been used to measure polarization [8, 10],
being specially useful for situations beyond Gaussian or
second-order statistics. A rather attractive feature when
dealing with entropies is the emergence of majorization
as a kind of meta-measure that establishes a once-for-all
partial ordering of statistics [11]. This partial relation
is respected by the Schur-concave functions, that include
the Shannon and R´enyi entropies [12].

We will study the coherence conveyed by two transver-
sal waves, this is four electric ﬁeld components. This
may be the case of the interference of partially polarized
waves emerging from the pinholes of a Young interfer-
ometer. The statistics will be fully speciﬁed by their
second-order ﬁeld correlations in the space-frequency do-
main, this is a 4 × 4 positive cross-spectral density ten-
sor Γ. The entropies and majorization will be applied
to its normalized spectrum, this is to the eigenvalues of
Γ/trΓ. As a proper precedent we can mention the ap-
plication of majorization to the analysis of polarization
of three-dimensional ﬁelds [13]. The conclusions will be
contrasted to other accounts of coherence more focused
on the ideas of ﬁeld correlation or fringe visibility.

For deﬁniteness let us focus on two vectorial electric
ﬁelds E at two spatial points r1,2 with just two non van-
ishing components at each point, say Ex,y. This can
be the transverse electric ﬁeld at the two pinholes of
a Young interferometer. The complete system is made
of four scalar electric ﬁelds that we will consider in the
space-frequency domain E(cid:96) (rj, ω) with j = 1, 2, (cid:96) = x, y,
and the temporal frequency ω will be omitted from now
on. Their statistics will be completely accounted for by
the second-order ﬁeld correlations gathered by the cross-
spectral density tensor, that in our case is a 4 × 4 non-
negative matrix Γ, with

where Γj,k are 2×2 correlation matrices with Γj,k = Γ
k,j,

Ey (rj)

(2.2)
with † representing Hermitian conjugation. Moreover,
we can collect the four components into a single four-
dimensional vector E with components E1 = Ex (r1),
E2 = Ey (r1), E3 = Ex (r2), E4 = Ey (r2), so that Γj,k =
(cid:104)EjE∗
k(cid:105), for j, k = 1, . . . , 4. Under these conditions every
account of coherence and polarization must be a function
of these matrices Γ and Γj,k.

Scalar interferometric coherence.– For complete-
ness we recall the standard measure of coherence µ in the
simplest case of two scalar ﬁelds E1,2

(cid:112)(cid:104)|E1|2(cid:105)(cid:104)|E2|2(cid:105) .

µ =

We refer to this as interferometric coherence in the sense
of being the key factor controlling the visibility of the
interference fringes obtained when superimposing E1,2.

Polarization.– Polarization expresses the coherence
between two components, say Ex,y of a transverse ﬁeld
vector at a given spacial point as

coherency matrix Γ. The main idea is that coherence is
reﬂected in the dispersion of the eigenvalues of Γ/trΓ,
j=1 λj = 1.
We have two clear extremes. We have full coherence for
those Γp with only one eigenvalue diﬀerent from zero, say
λ1 = 1, λj(cid:54)=1 = 0. On the other extreme, there is com-
plete lack of coherence for those ΓI where all the eigen-
values are equal λj = 1/N , so that ΓI is proportional
to the identity. In between, the degree of coherence may
be assessed using many possible functions of λ. Most of
them are of entropic nature, such as the R´enyi entropies

where here Γ refers to the 2×2 coherency matrix with ma-
trix elements Γj,k = (cid:104)EjE∗
k(cid:105), j, k = x, y. It is wort noting
that this is the maximum interferometric coherence (2.3)
that can be reached between any two ﬁeld components
E1,2 obtained from Ex,y by a unitary 2 × 2 matrix U ∈
U(2), this is to say µ(U ) ≤ P . After computing P for
E (r1,2) the two degrees of polarization P1,2 can be be
combined to provide a single value, for example as in
Refs. [14].

Vectorial interferometric coherence.– The inter-
ferometric account of coherence µ becomes more complex
when the interfering ﬁelds are vectorial. Accordingly, dif-
ferent deﬁnitions have been proposed as diﬀerent gener-
alizations of Eq. (2.3), such as [2–4]:

Global coherence.– In this work we are mostly inter-
ested in regarding the four ﬁeld components as a whole,
asking for the global coherence conveyed by the complete
ﬁeld. This should comprise both the polarization and in-
terferometric contributions, and should be expressed by
the whole Γ instead of its sub-matrices Γj,k.

For another perspective, we may say that polarization
and interferometric coherence depends on a choice of ﬁeld
modes, which is the equivalent of the basis dependence
in quantum mechanics. Thus we can attempt a mode-
independent approach where coherence may be referred
to as intrinsic, per se, or global [1]. This would be analo-
gous to the role played by the degree of polarization (2.4)
versus the degree of coherence (2.3) regarding two scalar
electric ﬁelds.

A convenient generalization of the degree of polariza-

tion (2.4) to four-dimensional ﬁelds can be

where λ is a four-dimensional vector containing the eigen-
values of Γ/trΓ [6]. An alternative assessment along this
line can be found in Ref. [5]. In the next section we show
that µg is actually a case of R´enyi entropy.

III. MAJORIZATION AND GLOBAL DEGREE

OF COHERENCE

Next we recall the idea of majorization and its rela-
tion with coherence measures as functions of the N × N

Rq(λ) =

1
1 − q

ln

(3.1)

−(cid:80)N

where q > 0 is an index labeling diﬀerent entropies.
The limiting case q → 1 is the Shannon entropy R1 =
j=1 λj ln λj. For example, we have that µg in Eq.

(2.8) is essentially R2 as

µ2

g =

(3.2)

We say that Γ majorizes ˜Γ, which will be expressed as
˜Γ ≺ Γ, when the following relation between all the or-
dered partial sums Sn of their corresponding eigenvalues
holds,

(cid:16)˜Γ

same λj but arranged in decreasing order

1 ≥ λ

↓
↓
2 ≥ . . . ≥ λ
N .

λ

(3.4)

Throughout we will say that Γ and ˜Γ are comparable if
one majorizes the other.

Next, some interesting facts about majorization. Ma-
jorization holds if and only if ˜λ = M λ where M is a
doubly stochastic matrix, so that ˜Γ is more uniform or

0S  (   ) nnΓS   (   )nΓmore mixed than Γ. For all Γ we have ΓI ≺ Γ ≺ Γp [15].
Whenever two Γ are comparable, the result is respected
by all Schur-concave functions that includes the R´enyi
entropies: if ˜Γ ≺ Γ then Rq(˜Γ) > Rq(Γ) for all q.

After all these facts we may say if ˜Γ ≺ Γ then Γ is
more coherent than ˜Γ. Majorization is a partial ordering
relation, so that there are incomparable states: this is
neither ˜Γ ≺ Γ nor Γ ≺ ˜Γ. In such a case the ordered
sums in Fig. 1 will intersect and the entropies will pro-
vide contradictory conclusions, such that Rq(˜Γ) > Rq(Γ)
while Rp(˜Γ) < Rp(Γ) for diﬀerent entropies p (cid:54)= q.

The case of 2× 2 matrices Γ is rather trivial since after
normalization the spectrum λ depends on a single pa-
rameter. Thus any two Γ are comparable and there is
no room for ambiguities nor discrepancies between mea-
sures. The case of 3 × 3 matrices Γ has been completely
addressed in a recent work [13] regarding Γ as represent-
ing polarization in three dimensions. Thus in this work
we address 4 × 4 matrices Γ, that may be representing
the two transversal ﬁelds described above. In the next
sections we analyze some relevant and illustrative cases.

IV. UNPOLARIZED BEAMS OF THE SAME

the Γ matrix can arranged so that

After these expressions for Sn majorization is actually
determined just by the two ﬁrst conditions in Eq. (3.3)
so that ˜Γ ≺ Γ if and only if the following two conditions
are satisﬁed

µS ≥ ˜µS, µS + µI ≥ ˜µS + ˜µI .

(4.6)

Since the degree of polarization of E (rj) vanishes one
might ask whether the majorization conditions (4.6) are
equivalent to any of the above degrees of interferometric
coherence in Eq.
(4.2) or the global coherence in Eq.
(4.3). The result is negative. To show this the picture in
Fig. 2 may be useful. This is a µS,I plane where any Γ is
represented by a point in the region of the ﬁrst quadrant
below the bisecting line. This is to respect the condition
µS ≥ µI ≥ 0. The dotted line represents the condition
µS ≥ ˜µS, while the dashed line represents the condition
µS + µI ≥ ˜µS + ˜µI . Therefore relations (4.6) deﬁne three
regions:
α: Points ˜Γ with ˜Γ ≺ Γ are to the left of the dotted
β: Points ˜Γ with Γ ≺ ˜Γ are to the right of the dotted

line and below the dashed line.

line and above the dashed line.

γ: Points ˜Γ incomparable with Γ.
After this it is clear from Eqs.

(4.2) and (4.6) that
µKW ≥ ˜µKW is just a necessary but not suﬃcient con-
dition for ˜Γ ≺ Γ. On the other hand, both µT SF and
µg depend just on the distance of the point Γ to the ori-
gin. Some simple geometry shows that within the region
µS ≥ µI the circle passing through Γ lies always on the γ
sectors, so that µT SF and µg provide necessary but not
suﬃcient conditions regarding majorization.

A simple example of incomparable states is provided
by µS = 1, µI = 0 and 1 ≥ ˜µS = ˜µI ≥ 1/2.
In
this case we have always ˜µKW ≥ µKW .
In Fig. 3 we
have represented R2(˜Γ) − R2(Γ) and R1(˜Γ) − R1(Γ). It
can be appreciated that for 0.78 > ˜µS > 0.71 the two
R´enyi entropies provide contradictory conclusions: this
is R1(˜Γ) > R1(Γ) versus R2(˜Γ) < R2(Γ). We have
plotted as well ˜µ2
T SF around this same region
showing regions where this measure of interferometric
coherence contradicts the entropies. Moreover, in Fig.
4 we plot the ordered partial sums Sn(Γ) and Sn(˜Γ) for
˜µS = ˜µI = 0.75 showing the lack of majorization.

competition between polarization and interferometric co-
herence. From now on we will focus on the dependence
on δ for ﬁxed µS.

In this case, since there is always a vanishing eigenvalue
we have S3 = S4 = 1 and majorization is just determined
by the ﬁrst two partial sums in Eq. (3.3). Taking into

account that S1 = λ

Regarding the ordering of the eigenvalues λ, we can
distinguish three cases depending on the relation between

After Eqs. (5.5) and (5.6) for µS = ˜µS we readily get

˜Γ ≺ Γ ↔ ˜δ ≥ δ.

(5.7)

This is a quite expected result since for δ < 1 increas-
ing δ means both lesser degree of polarization and lesser
interferometric coherence.

The opposite situation holds for δ > 1+µS. In this case
we will have δ > 1 so we may expect that global coherence
should emerge of a suitable balance between the opposed
behaviors displayed by the degree of polarization and the
interferometric coherence. The ordering of eigenvalues is

(5.4)

The dependence on µS is the expected one:
larger µS
implies both larger interferometric coherence and larger
global coherence. On the other hand, the dependence
on δ is more complicated. The degree of polarization
has a minimum at δ = 1, while interferometric coherence
always decreases when increasing δ. Regarding global co-
herence we have that for ﬁxed µS it has a minimum at
δ = 1 + µ2
S. Thus this example provides an interesting

˜Γ ≺ Γ ↔ ˜δ ≤ δ.

(5.9)

Roughly speaking, when δ increases the purity of the
state provided by polarization overwhelms the decrease
of the interferometric coherence.

Finally, in the intermediate situation 1 + µS > δ >
1 − µS and µS = ˜µS the states are always incomparable
unless ˜δ = δ. This is because

ized transversal waves. This is because it can be regarded
as a kind of meta-measure of global coherence whose con-
clusions are respected by entropic measures of polariza-
tion and coherence. Moreover, majorization allows us to
draw many parallels with coherence in quantum physics.

We have illustrated the approach by means of some
simple but meaningful examples. The results are con-
trasted to other measures of polarization and interfero-
metric coherence for vectorial waves. The situation is
particularly interesting when polarization and interfer-
ence behave in opposite ways.
