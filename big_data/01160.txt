Long-range synchrony and emergence of reentry

in neural networks

Hanna Keren & Shimon Marom

Abstract

Synchronization across long neural distances is a functionally impor-
tant phenomenon.
In order to access the mechanistic basis of long-
range synchrony, we constructed an experimental model that enables
monitoring of spiking activities over centimeter scale distances in large
random networks of cortical neutrons. We show that the mode of syn-
chrony over these distances depends upon a length scale, λ, which is
the minimal path that activity should travel through before meeting its
point of origin ready for reactivation. When λ is experimentally made
larger than the physical dimension of the network, distant neuronal
populations operate synchronously, giving rise to irregularly occurring
network-wide events that last hundreds of milliseconds to couple of
seconds.
In contrast, when λ approaches the dimension of the net-
work, a continuous self-sustained reentry propagation emerges, a regu-
lar dynamical mode that is marked by precise spatiotemporal patterns
(‘synﬁre chains’) that may last many minutes. These results contribute
to discussions on the origin of diﬀerent modes of neural synchrony in
normal and pathological conditions.

1 Signiﬁcance Statement

The mode of synchrony a neural network resumes is a critical determinant
of its function. The number of microscopic mechanisms that impact on
the macroscopic mode of synchrony is immense. Here we extract a lumped
physical parameter (λ), which is the minimal path that activity should travel
through before meeting its point of origin ready for reactivation. We show
that the value of λ controls the mode of synchrony in a network of biological
neurons. As such it promotes the understanding of synchrony modes oth-
erwise masked by the richness of underlying microscopic complexity. The
hope is that the insights gained in this study will cater to manipulation of
the phenomena in pathological conditions.

Introduction

Spontaneous synchronization between remote neural networks is one of the
hallmarks of brain activity, considered signiﬁcant for multiple functions in
health and disease [1–9]. As such, the study of mechanisms underlying
long-range synchronized activity is of substantial interest.
In the cortex,
long range centimeter scale synchronization involves an interplay between
the statistics of synaptic connectivity amongst excitatory neurons, and the
global eﬀect of rapidly propagated activity through electrically coupled in-
hibitory neurons [10–15]. There are many diﬀerent microscopic parameters
at the cellular and synaptic levels that impact on the above interplay be-
tween excitation and inhibition [16–19]. But here we are interested in expos-
ing a global physical parameter that mediates the translation of the many
microscopic mechanisms to macroscopic modes of long-range synchrony. To
this aim, we take advantage of a reduced experimental model of large-scale
networks composed of randomly connected cortical neurons. We show that
the mode of synchrony is sensitive to a characteristic length scale, λ, which
is the product of two parameters – the time scale (τ ) of the individual syn-
chronous event (including its refractory period), multiplied by the speed
of activity propagation (ν). When this length scale exceeds the longest
propagation path oﬀered by the network, the system acts as a single com-
partment, being active simultaneously. In contrast, when the characteristic
length scale is in the range of propagation paths supported by the network,
self-sustained activities appear, similar to the familiar reentrant dynamics in
cardiac arrhythmia. We manipulate the relevant parameters (τ and ν) us-
ing pharmacological blockade of GABAA mediated inhibition and show that
their relations determine the global mode of synchrony: from network-wide
simultaneous activity that occurs irregularly, to regular ongoing reentry dy-
namics that may last many minutes and runs through temporally precise
synﬁre-chains.

3 Results and Discussion

3.1 Long-range synchronization

When allowed to develop for a couple of weeks outside the brain, a popula-
tion of cortical neurons (extracted from the rat newborn) tends to form a
large-scale network that exhibits complex spontaneous activity. This spon-
taneous activity is characteristically composed of synchronous events (a.k.a.
‘network spikes’) that occur irregularly at an average rate of ca. 0.1 Hz, in-
terspersed with some uncorrelated sporadic activities [20–26]. The temporal
envelope of each synchronous event is usually monitored by integrating the

2

spiking activities detected through many individual electrodes (in the order
of several tens) arranged in an array.
In most cases the millimeter scale
electrode array is positioned at the center of the large-scale network (Figure
1A, left panel). Monitored through such relatively dense array of electrodes
at the center, the time scale of a single synchronous event – a single network
spike – is in the order of one hundred milliseconds, as depicted in Figure 1A
(middle and right panels) and discussed elsewhere [25].

In order to adjust the above standard experimental design to the subject
matter of the present study that involves distances an order of magnitude
larger, we constructed an electrode array layout consisting of four clusters
that cover a signiﬁcantly wider area (Figure 1B, left panel; diﬀerent colors
depict the physical identity of each recording region). As can be appreciated
by the examples provided in the middle and right panels of Figure 1B,
when activity is integrated over such distances, the apparent time scale of
a single synchronous event is accordingly extended (1.02 ± 0.47 seconds;
n=1721, 8 networks), a value that is comparable to durations observed in-
vivo [10, 13, 27]. Also note that activity propagates in a wave-like manner
across regions, although termination is less ordered (colored arrows).

The region wherefrom synchronous activity is initiated varies between syn-
chronous events. Figure 2A shows that the path of propagation amongst
the four regions is uniquely determined by the region of activity initiation;
this is indicated by the recruitment proﬁles of several synchronous events,
color coded according to initiation region. The averaged delay between ac-
tivities recorded in diﬀerent regions is 80 msec and is fairly consistent in the
eight diﬀerent networks studied here (Figures 2B-C). The calculated speed
of propagation (ν) is 0.18 meter per second (SD=0.08, n=1721 synchronous
events), which is within the range of reported propagation speed in the pri-
mate cortex [28]. The interval (τ ) between two subsequent initiations of
network spikes is broadly distributed, spanning a range of several seconds
(τ = 10.3 seconds, SD=11, n=1721). The standard deviation of τ , which is
in the order of the mean, is mainly contributed by variations in the inter-
event-intervals rather than the actual network spike shape. The minimal
value of τ , composed of the synchronous event itself and the recovery period
that follows, is rarely (< 5%) shorter than 3–4 seconds [25, 26, 29].

Note that the complex nature of connectivity statistics may be appreciated
by observing that earlier spiking activity in a given region does not entail a
respective earlier peak of the synchronous event within that region. In 17%
of the 1721 network spikes examined, a synchronous event initiated in one
region reaches peak population activity in a downstream region earlier than
in its upstream originator (inset to Figure 2C). This observation reﬂects,
most likely, a complex graph of connectivity and the presence of hub neurons,
as discussed elsewhere [25, 30, 31].

dard centered array of 60 electrodes. Three examples of spiking activity monitored
through such an array are shown at the middle panel. Each point depicts a single
spike detected in one of the electrodes (indexed in the vertical axis). Two syn-
chronous events (boxed) are presented at higher temporal resolution on the right-
hand panel. A superposed gray line shows normalized summed activity (binned
to 25 msec). (B) Similar presentation of activity recorded using a layout of 112
electrodes arranged in four clusters of recording regions (color coded). Arrows
demonstrate the duration of activation in each of the regions in respective colors.

The product τ·ν yields a characteristic length scale (λ) that sets a constraint
on the possible mode of synchrony. It provides an estimate for the minimal
length of path through which activity should travel before meeting its point
of origin ready for reactivation. The networks studied here are randomly
spread on top of a circular plate having a perimeter of ≈ 6 centimeters.
Therefore, the numbers provided above (τ > 3 sec, ν ≈ 20 cm/sec) yield a
characteristic length that is more than an order of magnitude larger com-
pared to the dimensions of the system, entailing a single-compartment-like
behavior.

Consistent with the above, the results presented in Figure 2D-F demonstrate
simultaneous termination of synchronous activity at distant sites on a cen-
timeter scale. In Figure 2D, four traces of synchronous events – averaged
from 8 diﬀerent networks – are shown, classiﬁed according to the rank-order
of activation times: The leftmost trace (depicted by arrow 1) is the aver-
age activity (spikes per msec) recorded in the ﬁrst-to-synchronize region,

Figure 2A, diﬀerent regions contributed to the average of this leftmost trace,
as each global synchrony event could have originated in any one of four dif-
ferent physical regions. Likewise, the traces depicted by arrows 2–4 are the
average activities recorded in the second, third and fourth-to-synchronize
regions, respectively, regardless of their physical identities. On average, the
envelope of a global synchronous event is dictated by the ﬁrst-to-synchronize
region; synchronized activity in all downstream regions converge to that en-
velope. This is also manifested as decreased amplitudes and durations of
synchronized events in downstream regions (Figures 2E-F). Overall, in spite
of consistent oﬀset in the initiation of synchronized activity – fully accounted
for by propagation delays – on average there is no appreciable oﬀset in the
termination of remote activities; the process of synchrony cessation over
relatively long distances seems literally simultaneous.

The phenomenon of simultaneous termination, without which a large-scale
network can fall into modes of self-sustained waves, has been hitherto demon-
strated in several animals in-vivo, using single and multi-unit recordings, as
well as EEG, and suggested to occur due to the inhibitory cells being strongly
coupled via gap junctions [15, 32, 33].

3.2 Manipulating the characteristic length scale by disinhi-

bition

We found GABAA blockers (Bicuculline or Picrotoxin) very useful as means
to explore the eﬀects of the product τ · ν on modes of synchrony. This
is due to the fact of both blockers demonstrating a seemingly paradoxical
eﬀect of increasing τ · ν at low concentrations, while decreasing it at high
concentrations. As demonstrated in Figures 3A-B, partial GABAA blockade
using ca. 5 µM Bicuculline (IC50 = 3µM) signiﬁcantly prolongs the duration
of synchronized activity, from the range of hundreds of milliseconds to several
seconds (3.69 ± 1.41 seconds; n=1721, 8 networks). Recruitment toward
synchrony becomes faster and propagation speed ν is increased to 0.43 meter
per second (SD=0.19, n=1143 events from 8 networks). The values of τ
are also increased (average 28 sec, SD=16, n=1143, 8 networks) and, as a
consequence, the characteristic length scale becomes very large compared to
control condition. The resulting network-wide synchrony mode is marked
by extended (several seconds) relaxations. Termination across the network,
while less simultaneous in absolute terms, is not much diﬀerent from control
condition when variation is normalized to the mean duration of the network
spike. These observations are congruent with previous reports on the eﬀect
of GABAA disinhibition in similar concentrations [25, 32].

tion times of temporally adjacent regions is shown in panel C (eight networks, 1721

bution of delays between times of maximal activity of regions, sorted according to

the rank-order of initiation times. (E) Values of maximal activity for each region,

(F) Time delay from detection of initiation of activity in a given recording region,

for within-region recruitment rate. Circles depict time from maximal activity of a
given region to ﬁrst occurrence of no activity within that same region, indicating
within-region decay time. Shaded margins are standard deviation across all events.

Intriguingly, under diﬀerent settings, other (even opposite) impacts of dis-
inhibition on the duration of synchronization were reported [34, 35]. Maybe
related, Chen et al. [32] suggested, based on numeric simulations, that fur-
ther elimination of inhibition might give rise to an opposite eﬀect of reduced
duration of synchronous events, due to fast activation of hyperpolarizing
conductances. With this in mind, we attempted pushing the product τ · ν

Indeed, we observe a non-
monotonous eﬀect of Bicuculline as concentration of the blocker is further
increased. Stronger GABAA block by Bicuculline slows down the propaga-
tion speed (ν) to 0.042 meter per sec (SD=0.015, n=478, 8 networks); this
is reﬂected in longer delays between activities of adjacent regions (Figure
3B, left). In addition, at these higher concentrations, the blocker decreases
the average τ to 1.52 seconds (SD=0.44, n=478, 8 networks); this is due to
shortening of within-region synchronous event duration, as well as shorten-
ing of the inter synchronous intervals (Figure 3B, right). We note a marked
variability in the concentration of Bicuculline required to elicit these eﬀects
in the four networks tested here, the average being 100 µM. The mech-
anism underlying the above non-monotonous eﬀects of Bicuculine is not
clear, and published reports cast doubt on whether at all they are related
to inhibitory synaptic transmission. Speciﬁcally, Bicuculline (methiodide
derivative) has been shown to impact on membrane ionic conductances by
blocking calcium-activated potassium channels [36]. We therefore replicated
the main observations related to high Bicuculline concentration using Pi-
crotoxin – a diﬀerent class of GABAA block [36–38] – using a concentration
indicated to induce complete blockade of GABAA inhibition (200 µM [39]).
Insets of Figures 3B show that the eﬀect of Picrotoxin on both propagation
speed ν and reactivation delays τ is similar to that of high concentrations of
Bicuculline, suggestive of a possible mechanism that does involve inhibition.
Regardless of the machinery underlying the eﬀect of high Bicuculline or Pi-
crotoxin concentrations, from the perspective of the present report what
matters is that the synchronization mode under these conditions is char-
acterized by slowly propagated activity that runs through adjacent regions
(Figure 3C).
More speciﬁcally, complete GABAA block reduces the product τ · ν from
ca. 200 cm in control conditions to a value close to the physical perimeter
of the network (slightly larger than 6 cm). As a consequence, emergence of
reentrant – self sustained (reverberating) patterns – becomes probable, and
Figure 4 demonstrates several realizations of such a mode. Episodes of reen-
try may last many minutes (Figure 4A), and the direction of the reentrant ac-
tivity may ﬂip between clockwise to counter-clockwise (Figure 4B). The pre-
ciseness of the spatial and temporal patterns emerging under this condition
is demonstrated in Figure 4C using terms borrowed from Schrader et al. [40]
in their analyses aimed at identiﬁcation of synﬁre-chains [41, 42]. Intrigu-
ingly, comparison of activity patterns of clockwise and counter-clockwise
reverberations (in a given network) suggests that waves of activity travel
through (more-or-less) the same path, but in opposite directions (Figure 4C
right panel). This implies that under complete disinhibition, the spatial cor-
relation length is shorter than the ca. 1 mm that separates nearby electrodes
within a region.

And, ﬁnally, in a case where reentry waves run along the perimeter of a
circular network, activity at the center area is expected to be less stereo-
typic. Indeed, when reentry commences, the activity recorded from several
electrodes located at the center of the array is signiﬁcantly reduced, and
becomes less correlated with the activity picked by the peripheral electrodes
(Figure 5).

experimental design and manipulating GABAA mediated inhibitory activity,
we demonstrate that a characteristic length scale, λ – the product of the
time scale (τ ) of a single synchronous event (including refractoriness) and
the speed of activity propagation (ν) – determines the mode of synchrony
between distant network areas. When the longest propagation path in a
random network, dictated by the network dimensions, is in the range of λ,
the network tends to fall into a self-sustained reentrant mode of synchronous
activity. We further show that the length scale is sensitive, in a non-trivial
manner, to the level of inhibitory transmission. (2) Sampling at a relevant
spatial scale matters, as interpretation of underlying mechanism might be
biased when monitored through a one given region. For instance, we and
others insisted, for many years now, to record the activity of large-scale
random networks through a cluster of electrodes positioned in the center
of the network, thus avoiding boundary eﬀects. Given the results reported
here, focusing on activity at the center of a disinhibited network might mask
the coherent nature of ongoing well-structured reentry dynamics, that can
only be captured by spreading recording electrodes over the appropriate
scale. Likewise, when focusing on one peripheral region we might have
interpreted disinhibition-induced reentry as a focal source of short synchrony
events, matching commonly observed epileptic-form activity [13, 32, 43].
And, (3) The results of our experimental analyses are not conﬁned to the
actual physical structure used here (circular arrangement); what matters
is the ratio between the characteristic length and the longest propagation
path supported by the network. Therefore, the message conveyed might
be relevant to discussions on the origin of reverberating activity in normal
conditions [44–50], and forms of epileptic seizures, described both in-vivo as
well as in-vitro [8, 35, 51–55].

region. (B) Exemplar activities detected in the four peripheral regions (black) and
one electrode located in the center (purple), under complete Bicuculline block. Ac-
tivity was binned to 250 msec. In between reentry phases, the activity detected in
central electrodes is highly correlated with activity in peripheral electrodes; within
reentry, this correlation drops. This is shown in panel (C), summarizing results
from 11 central electrodes in 6 diﬀerent networks.

4 Material & Methods

4.1 Cell preparation

Cortical neurons were obtained from newborn rats (Sprague-Dawley) within
24 hours after birth using mechanical and enzymatic procedures described
in earlier studies [23]. Rats were anesthetized by CO2 inhalation according
to protocols approved by the Technion’s ethics committee. The neurons
were plated directly onto substrate-integrated multi electrode arrays and
allowed to develop into functionally and structurally mature networks over
a period of 2-3 weeks. The number of plated neurons was of the order
of 450,000, covering an area of 380 mm2. The preparations were bathed
in MEM supplemented with heat-inactivated horse serum (5%), glutamine
(0.5 mM), glucose (20 mM), and gentamycin (10 µg/ml), and maintained
in an atmosphere of 37◦C, 5% CO2 and 95% air in an incubator as well as
during the recording phases. Inhibitory synaptic transmission was blocked
by acute application to the bathing solution of either Bicuculline-Methiodide
or Picrotoxin (Sigma-Aldrich).

An array of 112 TiN extracellular electrodes of 30 µm in diameter, was
used (MultiChannelSystems, Reutlingen, Germany). In this array the near-
est electrodes are spaced 990 µm from each other. Recording of central
region activity was performed using two columns of 4 electrodes separated
by 800 µm, located in the center of the culture. The insulation layer (sil-
icon nitride) was pre-treated with polyethyleneimine (Sigma, 0.01% in 0.1
M Borate buﬀer solution). A commercial ampliﬁer (MEA2100, MCS, Reut-
lingen, Germany) was used, analog data was low-pass ﬁltered (9 KHz) and
pre-ampliﬁed with a ×11 gain. Analog to Digital converters with frequency
limits of 100-5,000 Hz and a sampling rate of 50 KHz were applied. For a
detailed description of the recording setup see [56]. Data is transfered to a
PC via USB2.0 connection using 16 bit format, in resolution of 27 nV and a
rate of 25 KHz and analyzed using Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA).

4.3 Analyses
Action potentials were detected on-line by threshold crossing (6 × stan-
dard deviation). The threshold value was deﬁned separately for each of the
recording channels at the beginning of an experiment, from a 2 sec long
recorded voltage trace. A minimum of 6 msec interval between spikes was
required, per electrode. Synchronous events were analyzed oﬀ-line by thresh-
old crossing of summed action potentials in 25 msec bins. Threshold value
was adjusted relatively to 25% of active electrodes in the relevant recording
area. The initiation time of activity in a given recording region was deter-
mined by the average time stamp of the ﬁrst three spikes in that region.
Synﬁre chains were detected as described by Schrader et al.
[40]. Brieﬂy,
a pair-wise similarity matrix was computed by comparing the set of active
electrodes in bins of 3 msec; values were scales between 0-1 by normalizing
to the minimal number of active electrodes in each bin. The normalized
matrix of similarity was then plotted, color coded such that black depicts
full identity between two time bins, and a value of zero is depicted white. In
the resulting image, a continuous 45 degree line is the signature of ongoing
regularity, while the time gap between such lines represents the period of
regularity.
