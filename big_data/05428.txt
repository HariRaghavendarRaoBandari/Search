Abstract. We derive relativistic corrections for one-way and two-way time and
frequency transfer over optical ﬁbres neglecting no terms that exceed 1 ps in
time and 10−18 in fractional frequency, and estimate their magnitude in typical
ﬁbre links. We also provide estimates of the uncertainties in the evaluation of
the relativistic corrections due to imperfect knowledge of parameters like the
coordinates of the ﬁbre and stations, Earth rotation, or thermal eﬀects of the
ﬁbre index and length. The links between Teddington(UK) and Paris(F) as well as
Braunschweig(D) and Paris(F), that are currently under construction, are studied
as speciﬁc examples.

Relativistic Corrections for Time and Frequency Transfer in Optical Fibres

1. Introduction

2. Deﬁnitions

Atomic clocks have been improving rapidly over
the past years and are now reaching stabilities and
accuracies of a few parts in 1018 in fractional frequency
[1, 2]. Applications of such clocks in fundamental
physics, geodesy, navigation etc...
require their
comparison over large distances without degrading
their performance. At present, no existing satellite
or other long (intercontinental) distance comparison
method reaches the required level of uncertainty.
However, over short to medium distances (103 km)
optical ﬁbre links have demonstrated performance
below 10−18
in frequency transfer [3, 4, 5] and
such ﬁbre networks are therefore one of the key
technologies being developed for the application of the
new generation of atomic clocks in many ﬁelds.

The increasing requirements on time/frequency
the evaluation of
accuracy and stability pushes
phenomena that aﬀect the signal propagation in ﬁbre
links, and the models for their correction, to new
levels of uncertainty. One ensemble of such corrections
are related to the evaluation of relativistic eﬀects for
a ﬁbre which is moving with given velocity due to
the Earth surface motions (rotation, tides) and which
is exposed to the Earth gravity ﬁeld.
Systematic
relativistic theory of time and frequency transfer has
been worked out e.g. for the case of satellite transfer
so far [6, 7, 8, 9].

In our work we present a systematic relativistic
description of signal propagation in optical ﬁbres and
we derive relativistic corrections with an uncertainty
that is suﬃcient for the new generation of atomic
clocks. We provide expressions for one-way and
two-way time and frequency transfer neglecting no
terms that can exceed 1 ps in time and 10−18 in
fractional frequency. We then estimate the magnitude
of these terms and their uncertainty from imperfect
knowledge of the required parameters (ﬁbre and station
coordinates, Earth rotation, ﬁbre index variations,...).
Finally, we evaluate the expressions for time and
frequency transfer examples in Europe, in particular
on the PTB-SYRTE and NPL-SYRTE links that are
under construction.

In the main part of the text the resulting formulas
for relativistic corrections are summarized and the
technical details of the derivation can be found in the
appendix.

In this section we deﬁne some concepts and quantities
which will be used for the formulation of relativistic
corrections for time and frequency transfer.

First we consider a signal propagating in an optical
ﬁbre and an observer who is not moving with respect
to the ﬁbre at a certain ﬁbre point. We suppose that a
coordinate velocity of the signal as measured in a local
coordinate system of this observer, or more precisely a
magnitude of the velocity component which is tangent
to the ﬁbre, is given as

v =

c
neﬀ

(1)

where neﬀ is an eﬀective refractive index.
The
formula (1) can be understood as deﬁnition of
the eﬀective refractive index.
Its value should be
determined experimentally for a particular ﬁbre. This
value can diﬀer from a value of refractive index for
free propagation in the medium due to interaction
of the light signal with the walls of the ﬁbre. The
value of eﬀective refractive index also depends on
temperature of the ﬁbre, stress in the ﬁbre, frequency
of the signal, polarisation of the signal, possibly on
ﬁbre bending, etc. For a waveguide, neﬀ = β/β0 where
β and β0 are respectively the propagation constants
of the wave along the waveguide direction and in
vacuum. We will consider in the following that we can
describe the signal by a light ray. Therefore we do not
describe wave eﬀects such as dispersion, polarisation or
interferences explicitly. Nevertheless, waveguide eﬀects
are accounted for by the fact that the eﬀective index
can change with time and along the ﬁber, and by the
fact that the light ray represent one (transverse) guided
mode of the ﬁbre with propagation constant β. In the
following text we drop the index eﬀ and we denote the
eﬀective refractive index just n.

Throughout this work we use the Geocentric
Celestial Reference System (GCRS). This coordinate
system is centered in the center of mass of the Earth
and is non-rotating with respect to distant stars. The
GCRS coordinates are denoted (x0, xi) where x0/c = t
is the Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG) and xi =
(x, y, z) are the spatial coordinates of the system. The
small Latin indices go from 1 to 3.

where w and wi are respectively a scalar and a vector
potential deﬁned in [10, eq.(20)] with convention w ≥ 0.
We can treat the spatial slices of our spacetime
given by t = const. as Euclidean spaces, similarly as
in Newtonian physics. The metric of these Euclidean
spaces can be deﬁned by components δij in the spatial
GCRS coordinates xi. The tangent vectors of these
spaces (analogs of vectors in Newtonian physics) we
denote in bold and their scalar product given by the
Euclidean metric by dot. We denote ei the coordinate
basis of the coordinates xi and thus we have ei·ej = δij.
The ﬁbre is considered to be a one dimensional
object.
Its trajectory in spacetime is therefore
parametrised by two parameters - the coordinate time
t and a parameter λ which has a unique value for a
given ﬁbre element and is growing from an initial point
of the ﬁbre which we denote I to the ﬁnal point of the
ﬁbre which we denote F . The ﬁbre trajectory is given
parametrically as
xi = xi(t, λ) .

(5)

For a ﬁxed value of λ this equation gives a trajectory
of a corresponding ﬁbre element. We can deﬁne a
velocity vector ﬁeld of the ﬁbre in the GCRS frame
and a tangent vector ﬁeld of the ﬁbre with parameter
λ as

3. Time transfer

We consider a signal emitted from observer I at
coordinate time t0 which corresponds to proper time
τI0 of clock I. The signal is then received by observer
F at coordinate time t1 which corresponds to proper
time τF 1 of clock F (see ﬁgure 1). The ”pseudo-time-
of-ﬂight” τF 1 − τI0 is obtained from measurements.
Then a signal is sent from observer F at coordinate
time t1 and received by observer I at coordinate time
t2 which corresponds to proper time τI2 of clock I.
This signal can be either the same signal reﬂected or
another signal which is synchronously sent when the
one-way signal is received by observer F . We call
this set-up the Λ-conﬁguration. The ”pseudo-time-of-
ﬂight” τI2 − τF 1 is also obtained from measurements.
Using the coordinate time synchronisation convention
we deﬁne τI1 = τI (t1).
We denote ∆t+ = t1 − t0 the coordinate time of
signal propagation from I to F and ∆t− = t2 − t1 the
coordinate time of signal propagation from F to I.

It will be convenient to introduce a special choice
of the ﬁbre parameter λ which is given by a rest length

Figure 1. The signal leaves observer I at coordinate time t0
corresponding to proper time τI0 of clock I, is reﬂected from
observer F at coordinate time t1 corresponding to proper time
τF 1 of clock F and τI1 of clock I, and ﬁnally is received by the
observer I at coordinate time t2 corresponding to proper time
τI2 of clock I.

of the ﬁbre from its initial point I at time t1. We denote
this parameter l (see Appendix A.2 and formula (A.11)
for a precise deﬁnition). The range of this parameter
is l ∈ [0, L] with L being the total rest length of the
ﬁbre at the time t1.
For the coordinate propagation times we obtain
the following formula up to c−3 order (see Appendix
A for derivation) which gives all the terms larger than
1 ps

where v2 = v · v and all quantities in this formula are
evaluated at t = t1.‡

For a particular case of a 1000 km long optical
ﬁbre with refractive index 1.5 we obtain the following
numerical estimates of the terms in (7). The leading
Newtonian term (the c−1 term) has a value of 5 ms.
If the ﬁbre is located along the equator the value of
c−2 term is ±5 ns. This term corresponds to the
Sagnac correction as we will see. The c−3 term gives
3 ps at surface of the Earth. This term is a part of
Shapiro correction. Another part appears if we use the
Euclidean length instead of the rest length as the ﬁbre
parameter (see Appendix A for further details). Higher
order terms in 1/c are negligible for the 1 ps accuracy
level. E.g. the c−4 term is of order of 10−23 s per one
meter of the ﬁbre length.
‡ If needed the integrals can be expressed in terms of Euclidean
length parameter lE instead of
l using the transformation
formula (A.16).

[7]). However,

Analogous corrections appear also for the satellite
in case of
time transfer (see e.g.
ﬁbres, where the signal propagation is not geodesic,
the state of the ﬁbre given by its position, velocity
and refractive index enters the formulas. This is the
diﬀerence compared to the satellite transfer where only
the state of the emitter and receiver appears.

The full formula (7) would be used in case of one-
way time transfer. However, in practise it is diﬃcult to
evaluate the leading term of this formula with suﬃcient
accuracy. Therefore the two-way time transfer is used
which compensates this term.

Using the coordinate synchronisation convention,
the desynchronisation of the clocks is deﬁned as
diﬀerence τF 1 − τI1.
In case of the two-way time
transfer it can be expressed as
(∆τ−−∆τ+)(8)
τF 1−τI1 =
where ∆τ+ = τI1 − τI0 and ∆τ− = τI2 − τI1. The
”pseudo-time-of-ﬂights” τF 1 − τI0 and τI2 − τF 1 in (8)
are measured and the diﬀerence ∆τ−−∆τ+ needs to be
computed. The computed term can be approximated
as
∆τ− − ∆τ+ ≈ ∆t− − ∆t+ .
Error of this approximation is several orders below the
required 1 ps level for a ﬁbre at the Earth surface.
Using (7) we obtain

The term sldl = dxiei does not depend on choice
of the ﬁbre parameter (l in this case) and therefore
the integral in (10) can be easily transformed if any
other parameter (e.g. the Euclidean length) is more
convenient.

The main part of the velocity in the formula (10)
and in the second term of formula (7) comes from the
Earth rotation. To interpret this term we introduce
a new coordinate frame which rotates rigidly with
respect to the Euclidean frame of the GCRS system
with angular velocity vector ω. We suppose that this
rotating frame follows the rotation of the Earth surface
such that the residual velocity of the ﬁbre in this
rotating frame is minimized. We refer to this frame as
to a co-rotating frame. We denote the position vector
of a ﬁbre point by x and the velocity vector of a ﬁbre
point in the co-rotating frame by vR. We have
v = ω × x + vR .
For the scalar product in (10) we get
v · sl = (ω × x) · sl + vR · sl
= ω · (x × sl) + vR · sl .

ﬁbre positions where the eﬀect is maximized (see the text for
details).

If we write ω = ωo where o · o = 1, i.e. o is a unit

This quantity is the Sagnac area of the ﬁbre which for
certain simple ﬁbre paths can be understood as area
of a surface which is lying in a plane perpendicular to
ω between a projection of the ﬁbre into this plane and
lines connecting endpoints of this projection with the
rotation axis. This area can be positive or negative
depending on whether the parameter of the ﬁbre (l in
this case) goes along or against the direction of Earth
rotation. Using the Sagnac area A we can write

v · sl dl = 2ωA +

vR · sl dl .

In this formula the ﬁrst term is usually much larger
than the second one. We can estimate the second
term if the velocity vR is caused by the Earth tides.
The Earth tides are oscillatory deformations of the
Earth body with period of 12 h and amplitude of
vertical Earth surface motion of approx. 30 cm leading
to maximal vertical velocity of the Earth surface of
approx. 0.05 mm/s. The eﬀect would be maximal for
a ﬁbre path following a meridian near 45◦ latitude.
The second term of (14) then gives 0.3 fs contribution
to the correction (10) per 1000 km of the ﬁbre in this
maximizing example.

The phenomena aﬀecting the time transfer are

summarized in table 1.

For one-way frequency transfer we consider that a
signal with proper frequency νe is emitted from one

the geopotential diﬀerence between two clocks, a
technique called chronometric leveling [14]. A large-

observer with proper frequency νr. We suppose that a
phase of the signal which is observed by the emitting
observer at its proper time τe is observed by the
receiving observer at its proper time τr. This is
illustrated on ﬁgure 2.

The time τr is uniquely given by the time τe so we
can deﬁne a function τr(τe). The ratio of the proper
frequencies is then given as

The derivatives dte/dτe and dtr/dτr do not

eﬀect corrections. The same terms appear also for
diﬀerent ways of frequency transfer such as the satellite
[7]). These terms are investigated
transfer (see e.g.
in detail
in [6] and it is not the purpose of this
paper to study them. For a relative accuracy of the
frequency transfer of 10−18, these terms contain the
Newtonian gravitational potential of the Earth and of
external masses, as well as a correction for the non-
geodesic barycentric motion of the Earth. Recently
these terms have been determined with accuracy of
10−17 [11]. At present, a combination of terrestrial
data sets with up-to-date satellite gravity ﬁeld models
allows the calculation of these terms with accuracies
of a few parts in 1018, provided that high-resolution
and high-quality terrestrial and satellite data are
utilised [12].
Related research is tackled in the
frame of the project ITOC (International Timescales
with Optical Clocks) [13]. On the other hand, the

In this paper we focus on how the frequency
transfer is aﬀected by processes in the ﬁbre itself.
These eﬀects are contained in the dtr/dte term of
(15). This term includes e.g.
inﬂuences of changing
refractive index, changing ﬁbre length due to thermal
expansion or changing Sagnac area due to ﬁbre motion.
We denote T (t, l) a temperature of the ﬁbre as a
function of time and location and α the linear thermal
expansion coeﬃcient of the ﬁbre. Again we consider a
signal sent from I at time t0, reﬂected in F at time t1
and received back by I at time t2. The dtr/dte term
is then given by the following formula up to c−2 order

where + sign relates to propagation from I (emitter)
to F (receiver) and − sign to propagation from F
(emitter) to I (receiver). All quantities in the formula
are evaluated at the time t = t1. The formula includes
all terms larger than 10−18. Order of the c−3 term
is estimated to be 10−28 per one meter of the ﬁbre
length due to thermal eﬀects. The c−1 term of (16)
corresponds to the ﬁrst order Doppler eﬀect and the
c−2 term is a time derivative of the Sagnac correction.
Analogous terms can be found also in the satellite
frequency transfer [7], however, some diﬀerences occur.
E.g. the Doppler shift for ﬁbres does not depend on
velocities of the emitter and receiver but on expansion
and change of the refractive index of the ﬁbre.
Now we look to the c−1 term of (16) in more detail
and we estimate its value. The change of the refractive
index with time can be caused by various phenomena.
For our estimation we consider a change of n due to
temperature variation, i.e. ∂n/∂t = (∂n/∂T ).(∂T /∂t).
The values of
linear thermal expansion coeﬃcient
and temperature derivative of refractive index, based
on [15], can be estimated as

If we consider a 1000 km long ﬁbre with n = 1.5 we
obtain a value of 2 × 10−13 for the c−1 term of (16).
In case of one-way frequency transfer the full

formula (16)
is diﬃcult
term with a
suﬃcient accuracy. Therefore it needs to be actively
compensated or suppressed by means of two-way
frequency transfer. The c−2 term of (16) appears also
in the two-way transfer and it is discussed in more
detail below.

During two-way frequency transfer the observer I
emits a signal with proper frequency νI0. The signal is
received at observer F and immediately transponded
back to the observer I where a proper frequency νI2 is
measured§. The goal is to express the frequency νF 1
which should be observed by F at the time of reception
with use of the measured frequencies νI0 and νI2 and
a computed correction. We express a ratio νI2/νF 1 as
νI2
νF 1
where the ﬁrst term on the right hand side contains
only the measured quantities and the correction ∆
needs to be computed. For this correction we obtain

where the index I1 or F 1 means the quantity is

potential and velocity at the end-points of the ﬁbre and

The largest contribution to the acceleration a is
given by a centrifugal acceleration due to the Earth
rotation. To see the centrifugal acceleration explicitly
we can express a in terms of quantities related to the
frame co-rotating together with Earth as follows
a = ω × (ω × x) + 2ω × vR + ε × x + aR
where ω is the angular velocity of the Earth surface,
vR is the velocity of the ﬁbre points in the co-rotating

To obtain the best accuracy for the endpoint
terms of (26) given by sum of the scalar gravitational
potential w and the centrifugal potential, the two
contributions should not be computed separately but
the procedure described in [6] should be followed.

Contributions to the integral term of (26) are given
e.g.
by Earth tides or by variations in the Earth
rotation. Considering the Earth tides with period of
12 h and amplitude of vertical Earth surface motion of
approx. 30 cm we obtain maximal vertical velocity
of the Earth surface of approx.
0.05 mm/s as we
already mentioned and maximal vertical acceleration
of approx. 6 × 10−9 ms−2. The maximal contribution
of the Earth tides is given by the Coriolis term in (26)

processes in the whole ﬁbre and they are calculated per 1000 km
of the ﬁbre length. Values for the last three corrections are
examples for speciﬁc ﬁbre positions where the eﬀect is maximized
(see the text for details).

for a ﬁbre path following the equator. Its value in this
maximizing example is 8 × 10−20 per 1000 km of the
ﬁbre. The maximal contribution of the aR term in (26)
due to the Earth tides is around 3× 10−20 per 1000 km
of a ﬁbre following a meridian near 45◦ latitude.

R therefore oscillate with one day

mostly due to the changing direction of ω. This value
was estimated based on known evolution of the Earth
angular velocity vector in Terrestrial Reference Frame.
The component εz
R is several orders below the x, y -
components corresponding to the fact that the eﬀect
of changing magnitude of ω is much smaller than the
eﬀect of changing direction. The largest contribution
of the Euler term in (26) would be observed for a
ﬁbre path following the meridian perpendicular to the
instant direction of ε (neglecting the εz
R component).
In this maximizing example we obtain the contribution
of 4 × 10−20 per 1000 km of the ﬁbre.

The phenomena contributing to the frequency

transfer corrections are summarized in table 2.

5. Required uncertainty of the input
parameters

In this section we discuss what is the required
uncertainty of the input parameters entering the
formulas for time and frequency transfer in order to
keep the uncertainty of the resulting corrections below
the 1 ps target for time transfer and 10−18 target for
frequency transfer.

The required uncertainty of the length of the ﬁbre
in case of one-way time transfer would be 0.2 mm
to achieve 1 ps uncertainty of the propagation time.
For 1000 km long ﬁbre the required uncertainty of the
eﬀective refractive index would be 3 × 10−10. Since
these uncertainties are diﬃcult to achieve in practice,
e.g. because of unknown temperature variations, the
two-way transfer is used. Therefore we focus to the
evaluation of the two-way time transfer formula (10)
only.

For evaluation of (10) we use its form given by
(14). First we investigate uncertainty of the Sagnac
term due to uncertain position of the ﬁbre and we
look for a requirement for the position uncertainty
leading to the Sagnac term within the 1 ps uncertainty
limit. We consider that the ﬁbre position at certain
coordinate time is shifted by a vector ξ(l), i.e.
the
new position vector is x(l) + ξ(l). The corresponding
change of the Sagnac term can be obtained by inserting
this new position vector to the formula (13) where
sl = dx/dl. Expanding this formula and integrating
by parts we obtain
2ω∆A = ω · (xF × ξF ) − ω · (xI × ξI )

where xI , ξI are the position vector and shift vector at
the initial end of the ﬁbre and similarly xF , ξF are the
quantities at the ﬁnal end. The change of the Sagnac
term in the time transfer correction (10) is given as
2ω∆A/c2.

First we look to the contribution of the endpoint
terms of the formula (27). These terms correspond to a
change of the Sagnac area given by a shift of the lines
connecting the endpoints of the ﬁbre with the Earth
center and they are maximized when the endpoints of
the ﬁbre lie at the equator and when the shift vectors
point along the equator.
In this case we have e.g.
ω·(xF ×ξF ) = ωREξF with RE being the Earth radius
and ξF = ||ξF|| is the Euclidean magnitude of ξF . We
get ωREξF /c2 = 1ps for ξF ≈ 200 m, i.e. a shift of an
endpoint of the ﬁbre by not more than approx. 200 m
can cause a shift in time transfer by not more than
1 ps.

Next we look to the contribution of the integral
term of (27). This term corresponds to the Sagnac
area in between the original and shifted ﬁbre paths. If
we assume that the shift ξ does not change the rest
length of the ﬁbre, we can derive the following upper
bound

The corresponding upper bound for change in the
correction (10) therefore is 2ω ¯ξL/c2. It equals to 1 ps
for ¯ξ ≈ 600 km2 × L−1. For an example of 1000 km
long ﬁbre it means that average uncertainty of ﬁbre
position better than approx. 600 m is suﬃcient for
1 ps uncertainty in time transfer.

Including a ﬁbre expansion into ξ(l) adds a minor
correction to the bound (28) for expectable ﬁbre length
uncertainties.

Next we check the eﬀect of changing ω for the
time transfer. The condition 2∆ωA/c2 = 1 ps for
an equatorial ﬁbre where A is maximized leads to
∆ω/ω ≈ 200 m × L−1. For a 1000 km long ﬁbre it
corresponds to a relative uncertainty of order of 10−4
in ω. The ﬂuctuations of Earth angular velocity are
much smaller than this so the Earth angular velocity
is not an issue from the uncertainty point of view.

L

The second term of (14) can be expressed as a
(cid:82) L
product L¯vRt where we deﬁned an average tangent
velocity of the ﬁbre in the co-rotating frame as
0 vR · sl dl. The 1 ps change in time
¯vRt ≡ 1
transfer correction due to a variation in ¯vRt occurs if
L∆¯vRt/c2 = 1 ps, i.e. the maximal allowed uncertainty
of ¯vRt for 1 ps time transfer is ∆¯vRt = 9 × 104 m2/s ×
L−1, which for 1000 km long ﬁbre gives 0.09 m/s. If
the ﬁbre is ﬁxed to the Earth surface the magnitude of
vR itself is usually much smaller than this. E.g. the
maximal velocity caused by the Earth tides is around
0.05 mm/s as already mentioned.

A variation of L in the product L¯vRt leads to the
1 ps shift in time transfer if ∆L¯vRt/c2 = 1 ps. For
expectable values of ¯vRt this leads to values of ∆L
which are much larger than the usual uncertainty of
length measurement. Therefore the uncertainty of the
ﬁbre length is not an issue in this term.

The input parameters for time transfer and their

required uncertainties are summarized in table 3.

The
time derivative of
temperature of the ﬁbre would be 3 × 10−11 K/s to
achieve the 10−18 uncertainty in one-way frequency
transfer for 1000 km long ﬁbre. Since this is diﬃcult
to achieve in practise the two-way transfer is used.
Therefore, also for the frequency transfer, we focus to
the analysis of the two-way correction which is given
by (26). The end-point terms given by sum of the
scalar gravitational potential and centrifugal potential
need to be known with uncertainty of 0.09 m2s−2

We deﬁne an average tangent acceleration of the

This quantity should be known with uncertainty better
than ∆¯aR = 0.09 m2s−2 × L−1 in order to achieve the
10−18 uncertainty in (26). For 1000 km long ﬁbre it
gives 9 × 10−8 ms−2. If we consider Earth tides as the
source of the ﬁbre acceleration in the co-rotating frame
then its maximal value would be around 6×10−9 ms−2.
Now we consider that the velocity of the ﬁbre in
the co-rotating frame is changed from a value vR to
a value vR + ∆vR. The corresponding change of the
Coriolis term in (26) is then given as

better than 0.6 mm/s is suﬃcient for 10−18 uncertainty
in frequency transfer. If we consider e.g. Earth tides
as a source of motion of the ﬁbre the maximal velocity

of the ﬁbre in co-rotating frame would be around
0.05 mm/s.

Uncertainty requirement for the Earth angular
velocity in the Coriolis term is not an issue since the
expected value of vR is very small.

For a change of the Euler term in (26) due to
a variation ∆ε in the angular acceleration vector we
obtain the following upper bound

(∆ε × x) · sl dl

(33)

where Rm is the maximal value of ||x|| approximately
given by the Earth radius and ∆ε = ||∆ε||. The
corresponding upper bound in the correction (26) then
is Rm∆εL/c2 and it equals to 10−18 for ∆ε = 1.4 ×
10−8 ms−2 × L−1. For example, an uncertainty of
1.4 × 10−14 s−2 in angular acceleration is suﬃcient for
10−18 uncertainty in frequency transfer for a 1000 km
long ﬁbre. But, the value of ε itself usually does not
exceed 5 × 10−16 s−2 as we already mentioned.

The input parameters for frequency transfer and
their required uncertainties are summarized in table 4.

6. Numerical calculation of corrections for the
NPL-SYRTE and PTB-SYRTE ﬁbre links

In this section we evaluate the relativistic corrections
for time and frequency transfer in real ﬁbre links con-
necting SYRTE (Paris, France) with NPL (Tedding-
ton, United Kingdom) and with PTB (Braunschweig,
Germany) (see Fig.3). These ﬁbres are part of the RE-
FIMEVE+ project(cid:107), which aims to build a metrologi-
cal ﬁbre network in Europe.

We focus on the two-way time and frequency
transfer since the uncertainty of the leading c−1 terms
in one-way transfer coming e.g.
from an uncertainty
of ﬁbre length would lead to an inaccuracy that would
completely surpass the relativistic corrections.

For the two-way time transfer we compute the
main contribution given by the Sagnac correction (10).
In the two-way frequency transfer formula (20) the
main contribution is given by the δ-terms containing
the scalar potentials and velocities at the endpoints
of the ﬁbre. As we already mentioned the evaluation
of this term requires a high accuracy knowledge of the
gravitational potentials and it is a subject of a separate
research.

Here we focus on the second term which comes
from the time derivative of the Sagnac term. This term
is the largest contribution coming from the processes
in the ﬁbre (not just from the state of the endpoints).

6.1. Discretized equations for the Sagnac correction

For the numerical computation we suppose that we
know positions of certain points of the ﬁbre and
in between these points we consider the ﬁbre to
be a straight line in Euclidean sense in the GCRS
coordinates. We suppose that we know N + 1 points of
the ﬁbre and we index the points by index in brackets,
i.e.
(i) = 1, . . . , N + 1. We have deﬁned an initial
point of the ﬁbre I and endpoint of the ﬁbre F and we
suppose that the index (i) is growing from I to F with
(i) = 1 at I and (i) = N + 1 at F . We need to express
the formulas for corrections in terms of coordinates
of the known points and their time derivatives. We
denote the spatial GCRS coordinates of the i-th ﬁbre
point by xa
(i)(t) = (x(i)(t), y(i)(t), z(i)(t)). Using (6) the
Sagnac correction term can be expressed as

We consider the motion of straight ﬁbre segments

endpoint of the segment to another.

If the eﬀect of ﬁbre velocity vR in the frame co-
rotating with Earth is negligible (this velocity can
appear e.g. due to the Earth tides) then we can use
the formula (14) to express the Sagnac correction in a
way which contains the Earth rotation explicitly. The
Sagnac area A can be expressed using the formula (13).

of the GCRS system with the i-th ﬁbre point the

The time derivative needed for frequency transfer
can be obtained directly by diﬀerentiating the formula
(36) with respect to time.

6.2. Fibre routing

The path of the ﬁbre between PTB and SYRTE, and
between NPL and SYRTE, is poorly known. However,
the ﬁbre is going through several shelters: the positions
of these shelters have been measured with GPS, and
the length of the ﬁbre between these shelters have been
measured with a laser going through the ﬁbre. There
are 23 known shelters along the PTB-SYRTE path,
and 15 along the NPL-SYRTE path. From these data
we build three diﬀerent ﬁbre paths:

it

(i) the direct path:

is obtained by directly
connecting the shelters with straight lines. This
path largely underestimate the total ﬁbre length.
(ii) the maximum path: for this path we ﬁx the ﬁbre
lengths between each shelters to the measured
values. An inﬁnite number of paths can be
followed by the ﬁbre between two given shelters,
giving diﬀerent values for the Sagnac eﬀect; we
choose one that approximates the maximum of the
Sagnac eﬀect.

(iii) the minimum path: as for the maximum path,
the ﬁbre lengths between each shelters are ﬁxed to
the measured values. Then we choose a path that
approximates the minimum of the Sagnac eﬀect.

These three paths are shown on a map in ﬁgure 3.

6.3. Evaluation of the relativistic corrections for
NPL-SYRTE and PTB-SYRTE ﬁbre links

6.3.1. Two-way time transfer The values obtained for
the two-way time transfer Sagnac eﬀect (10) can be
found in table 5. The model used is accurate to better
than 1 ps, however the uncertainty in the ﬁbre position
leads to an uncertainty in the computed correction
bigger than 1 ps. We estimate the uncertainty on
the Sagnac eﬀect due to the poorly known ﬁbre path
by calculating the Sagnac eﬀect for the three paths
described in the previous paragraph. The diﬀerences

of the Sagnac eﬀect between the maximum and the
minimum paths are:

• PTB-SYRTE paths: 53 ps
• NPL-SYRTE paths: 12 ps

There are also variations of the Sagnac term due to
Earth tides and due to changes in the angular velocity
vector of the Earth. All these variations, however, lead
to corrections of order or less than 5 fs. Tides also
imply a residual velocity with respect to the co-rotating
frame, which lead to a correction which is much less
than 1 ps.

6.3.2. Two-way frequency transfer
In time derivative
of the Sagnac correction in (20) there are contributions
coming from the Earth tides and from the variation
of the angular velocity vector of the Earth. All these
contributions are varying and have amplitudes of order
10−19 or less, which corresponds to a variation of
around 5 fs over 12 hours in the time transfer.

These terms are not studied in detail here as they
are below the accuracy goal. However it would be
interesting to model them accurately as they are just
one order of magnitude below the limit of the actual
clock stability. By integrating the clock frequency
comparison for a long time it could be detectable.

7. Conclusion

In this work we presented a systematic relativistic
description of propagation of a signal in optical ﬁbres.
We derived a general diﬀerential equation governing
the signal propagation and we investigated its solution
up to terms of order c−3. This is suﬃcient for accuracy
of 1 ps for time transfer formulas and for relative
accuracy of 10−18 for frequency transfer formulas. This
accuracy corresponds to the requirements of nowadays
and near future optical clocks applications.

Formulas for both one-way and two-way time
and frequency transfer were derived. The largest
relativistic correction for one-way and two-way time
transfer is the so called Sagnac eﬀect which strongly
depends on the ﬁbre positioning on Earth surface
and its magnitude usually does not exceed order of
nanoseconds. The next signiﬁcant correction for one-
way transfer takes gravitational ﬁeld into account and

depends on the gravity potential along the ﬁbre. This
correction usually does not exceed order of picoseconds.
For frequency transfer there is the well known
gravitational red shift which depends only on state
of the endpoints of the ﬁbre. Moreover there are
other eﬀects which depend on the processes in the ﬁbre
itself. For two-way transfer the largest eﬀects are due
to change of the ﬁbre position with time and due to
thermal variations. Contribution of these eﬀects was
estimated to be smaller than 10−18.

vector to a trajectory of the signal propagating in
the ﬁbre the condition (1) can be written in terms
of components of vector kα in the rest frame of the

It means that the signal propagates along null lines of
a modiﬁed metric γαβ. Besides exchanging a refractive
index for the eﬀective refractive index this is exactly
the metric introduced by Gordon in [17].

Now we are going to derive an equation for signal
propagation in optical ﬁbre based on the condition
(A.4).

We consider a spacetime with time coordinate t.
The ﬁbre is considered to be a one dimensional object,
i.e. its trajectory is 2D surface in spacetime. Fibre is
parametrised by two parameters - the coordinate time
t and a parameter λ which has a unique value for a
given ﬁbre element. The parameter λ has a range λ ∈
[λI , λF ] and is growing from an initial point of the ﬁbre
which we denote I to the ﬁnal point of the ﬁbre which
we denote F . If xα are coordinates on the spacetime
the ﬁbre worldsurface is given parametrically as
xα = xα(t, λ) .
For a ﬁxed value of λ this equation gives a trajectory
of a corresponding ﬁbre element. Therefore the four-
velocity of the ﬁbre U α is proportional to a partial
derivative of xα(t, λ) with respect to time. We have

(A.6)

U α = U β∂βt

where the proportionality factor can be expressed using

The parameters t, λ can be seen as coordinates on
the worldsurface of the ﬁbre. The signal trajectory can
be therefore described by functions t(σ), λ(σ) where σ
is some parametrisation of the signal trajectory.
In
coordinates xα the trajectory reads xα(t(σ), λ(σ)). It
will be convenient to choose the parameter σ = ±λ
where + is for propagation from I to F , i.e. with
increasing λ, and − is for propagation from F to I,
i.e. with decreasing λ. In this case the tangent to the
trajectory can be expressed as

The equation (A.10) is a diﬀerential equation for
the function t(λ) which describes the trajectory of the
signal in the ﬁbre in terms of coordinate time t at which
the signal reaches an element λ of the ﬁbre. The sign +
in the equation relates to the signal propagation from
I to F , i.e. along the orientation of the λ coordinate
and the sign − relates to propagation from F to I.

Appendix A.2. Propagation equation for optical ﬁbre
on Earth surface

Now we are going to express the right hand side of
the equation (A.10), for a particular case of a ﬁbre
located on Earth surface. We can do it using the
formulas (A.7) and (A.8) where xα are chosen to be the
GCRS coordinates (ct, x, y, z) with metric components
gαβ given by (2), (3) and (4). The derivatives ∂xα/∂t
and ∂xα/∂λ which occur in (A.7), (A.8) and (A.10)
can be expressed in terms of the velocity vector ﬁeld
and tangent vector ﬁeld of the ﬁbre deﬁned by (6).

Moreover an Euclidean vector corresponding to
the vector gravitational potential wi can be deﬁned as
w = wiδijej .

The ﬁrst term on the right hand side of (A.13)
corresponds to the Newtonian limit. The second
term corresponds to the Sagnac correction.
The
third term corresponds to a part of the Shapiro
correction. Another part would appear if we would
use an Euclidean length of the ﬁbre in the GCRS
coordinates as the parameter λ (see the discussion
below). The fourth term contains the geodetic and
Lense-Thirring eﬀect.

The parameter λ in (A.13)

is an arbitrary
parameter satisfying the condition that its value is
unique (not changing in time) for a given ﬁbre element.
However, some natural choices can be done which are
convenient for practical purposes. One possibility for
such a parameter is the rest length lt itself at a speciﬁc
time t1. The ﬁbre can expand e.g. due to temperature
changes and therefore lt must be ﬁxed at certain time
to fulﬁll the uniqueness condition. We denote this
parameter l, i.e.
If we consider the
thermal expansion we have

= 1 + α(T (t, l) − T (t1, l))

l(λ) = lt(t1, λ).

where T (t, l) is temperature of the ﬁbre at given time

Another choice of the parameter could be an
Euclidean length of the ﬁbre at a time t1. The

(∂lt/∂l).(∂l/∂lE) with the derivatives on the right

Appendix A.3. Solving the equation for signal
propagation

Now we are going to solve the diﬀerential equation
(A.13). We denote the right hand side of (A.13) by
Ω±(t, λ) with + sign referring to propagation from I
to F and − sign referring to propagation in opposite
direction. Then the equation (A.13) can be written as

dt±
dλ

= Ω±(t, λ) .

(A.17)

If Ω± does not depend on t we can integrate the
equation directly. However, Ω± depends on time t,
because of e.g.
thermal expansion, Earth tides or
variations of the instantaneous rotation vector of the
Earth. Nevertheless, these time dependencies are very
slow, and we will see that the value of Ω± does not
change signiﬁcantly during the propagation time of the
signal from one end to the other end of the ﬁbre, which
is around 5 ms for a 1000 km ﬁbre with index n = 1.5.
We consider a signal emitted from observer I at
time t0, reﬂected from observer F at time t1 and
received back by observer I at time t2 as depicted
in ﬁgure 1. We use l as the parameter of the ﬁbre
which was deﬁned as l(λ) = lt(t1, λ). The range of the
parameter is l ∈ [0, L] with L = l(λF ) being the total
rest length of the ﬁbre at time t1.

Formal solution of the equation (A.17) can be

written in a form

t±(l) = t1 +

The formula (A.18) can be further processed by

The order of deviation of the exact solution from the

t±(l) = t[2]± (l) + O
(A.21)
where δl = l− L and δt(l) is propagation time between
l and L. This deviation turns out to be negligible for
our level of accuracy, e.g. for 1000 km long ﬁbre and
for eﬀects caused by temperature variations it gives
10−28 s. Therefore we use the formula (A.20) for t±(l).
Now we expand Ω±(t, l) in (A.20) in time around

t1. We obtain

where we used (1−ε)−1 ≈ 1+ε for the + direction and
therefore we neglected terms of order ε2, i.e. of order
(∂Ω±/∂t)2L2 ∼ 10−38m−2 × L2 in a case of thermal
variations of Ω±.

In the formula (A.33) we also neglected the terms
coming from the higher order variations of Ω±.
In
particular, we have seen that the ﬁrst order term of
expansion (A.22) given by (A.27) leads to a correction
in the frequency transfer:
dt(1)
r±
∼ 9 × 10−16s−2 × n0

for a ﬁbre with L ∼ 1000 km and n0 ∼ 1.5.
Inserting the Ω± given by (A.13) into (A.33) up
to the c−2 order and with use of (A.26) we obtain the
formula (16).

c

The two-way frequency transfer is described by
the formula (19). This formula can be understood
as deﬁnition of the correction ∆ which needs to
be computed. The ∆ can be expressed from (19)
and further processed using the formula (15) for the
frequency ratios with dtr/dte given by (A.33) and
dt/dτ calculated from the metric.
We write dt/dτ = 1 + δ with δ (cid:28) 1 (on the Earth
surface δ ∼ 10−9). Therefore we neglect terms where δ
multiplies the integrals of ∂Ω±/∂t which, for the case
of thermal variations of Ω±, are of order L(∂Ω±/∂t)δ ∼
10−28m−1×L, far below the required accuracy. We also
neglect the δ2 terms since their contribution together
with c−4 terms of δ is of order below 10−24 for altitude
diﬀerence of the ﬁbre endpoints below 10 km at the
Earth surface. Using these approximations we obtain
the following formula for the computed correction
∆ = (δI0 + δI2)/2 − δF 1

where the indices I0, I2 mean that the quantity is
evaluated at the position of the observer I at the time
t0 or t2 respectively and similarly the index F 1 means
the quantity is evaluated at the position of the observer
F and time t1. In (A.35) we can approximate
(δI0 + δI2)/2 ≈ δI1
since the non-linearity of δI (t) causes deviations which
are far below the required accuracy.
Inserting (A.36) and the Ω± given by (A.13) up to
the c−3 order into (A.35) we obtain the formula (20).

For our estimation we consider a change of n due to
changing temperature, i.e. ∂n/∂t = (∂n/∂T ).(∂T /∂t).
Based on the values given by (17) and (18) we estimate:
t(1)± ∼ 2 × 10−11s−1 × n0

for a ﬁbre with L ∼ 1000 km and n0 ∼ 1.5.
Therefore, a maximum variation of 0.6 fs occurs in 12 h,
corresponding to a change in the relative frequency
comparison of ∼ 1.5 × 10−20, below the required
accuracy.
