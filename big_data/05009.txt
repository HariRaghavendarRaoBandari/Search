Any tripartite state which saturates the strong subadditivity relation for the quantum entropy is
deﬁned as the Markov state. A tripartite pure state describing an open system, its environment and
their purifying system is a pure Markov state iﬀ the bipartite marginal state of purifying system
and environment is a product state.
It has been shown that as long as the puriﬁcation of the
input system-environment state is a pure Markov state the reduced dynamics of the open system
can be described, on the support of initial system state, by a quantum channel for every joint
unitary evolution of the system-environment composite even in the presence of initial correlations.
Entanglement, discord and classical correlations of the initial system-environment states implied by
the pure Markov state are analyzed and it has been shown that all these correlations are entirely
speciﬁed by the entropy of the environment. Some implications concerning perfect quantum error
correction procedure and quantum Markovian dynamics are presented.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Each real world quantum system forms a closed com-
pound system with its surrounding environment and
evolves together with it under joint unitary evolutions.
Such systems are called open quantum systems (OQSs)
[1, 2]. Each OQS interacts and gets correlated to some ex-
tent with its environment and evolves according to quan-
tum rules individually, at least for a while, before com-
pletely loosing its quantum coherence property [2]. On
the other hand, the main goal in realizing many quan-
tum information and quantum computation tasks is to
maintain, as long as possible, the coherence properties
of information carriers which are constantly interacting
with ambient medium [3]. However, despite their im-
portance in our understanding the quantum aspects of
the nature around us and in the emerging ﬁelds of quan-
tum technologies we still lack a complete understanding
of evolutions of OQSs initially correlated with their en-
vironment.

Physically most appealing way to describe evolutions
of an OQS is by the so-called completely positive (CP)
maps [4, 5]. These are linear maps which transform every
positive operators in their deﬁnition domain to positive
operators and maintain this property in all tensorial ex-
tensions. Trace preserving CP maps are called quantum
channels and they are interchangeably referred to also
as CPTP maps: These map any quantum state (density
operator; positive operator with unit trace) to another
quantum state [6]. One of the physical intuitions behind

†Electronic address: vercin@science.ankara.edu.tr
‡Electronic address: soyilmaz@ankara.edu.tr

such maps is that, when the extension of a given CPTP
map is applied to any joint quantum state of the com-
pound system the result is certainly another admissible
joint state and when the eﬀects of additional system are
then averaged out what remains is the action of the same
map on the reduced state of the original OQS. This holds
irrespective of the correlations the initial joint state may
have and of the dimension of added system.

In real world and in the laboratory applications CP
maps are reduced from the joint unitary evolutions and
the essential problems arise in this context.
In such a
case the action of a joint unitary map on a joint state
may not give the action of a even positive map, let alone
CP map, on the reduced state of the OQS after discarding
the environment [7] (see also [8]). Certainly, uncorrelated
joint states, that is, product states are exceptions and
starting with such a state has become a basic assumption
in almost all approaches to the dynamics of OQSs.

In fact, as we are going to show, there is a whole set of
exceptions that provide a large family of initially corre-
lated joint states, not recognized in the literature before
the last couple of the years [9]. The main goal of this
study is to specify such a well deﬁned set of correlated ini-
tial system-environment states that permit CP reduced
dynamics for the observed OQS and to explore all clas-
sical and quantum correlations of this set. The family
that will be explored here is speciﬁed by the joint states
that can be reconstructed from their marginal states via
the actions of CP maps. Since averaging the eﬀect of a
subsystem is carried out by a partial trace, such a CP
map locally reverses the action of partial trace map on
the considered state. Evidently, a product joint state is
such a state since tensoring by an additional state is a
CPTP map on the other factor and therefore this family
contains uncorrelated initial states as special cases.

Reconstruction positive maps were also known in the

context of OQSs under the name of the assignment maps
but, unfortunately, they were not explored suﬃciently
enough. A detailed study of reconstruction CP maps
were made in another context; in characterising tripar-
tite states that saturate the strong subadditivity (SSA)
relation for the (von Neumann) quantum entropy [10–12]
(and the references therein). In this context such a map
is known as the Petz recovery map and related tripartite
states are called Markov states. Very recently, by includ-
ing an additional blind and dead reference system into
discussion F. Buscemi has shown in Ref. [9] that the re-
duced dynamics of an OQS can be described by CP maps
in the presence of initial correlations. Such a description
is possible for tripartite states of the reference system,
the OQS and the environment trio for which the quan-
tum mutual information between the reference system
and the environment, conditional on the system, is zero.
Positivity of this mutual information is better known as
the SSA relation [3, 10]. For a detailed exposition of the
matter and in order to be able to analyze the initial cor-
relations, in this study, we shall use a similar tripartite
framework in the case of pure Markov states.

II. FRAMEWORK OF THIS STUDY AND

SUMMARY

We shall denote the OQS and its environment, respec-
tively, by Q and E and suppose that the bipartite sys-
tem QE forms a closed system subject to time-dependent
joint unitary operator U QE. The purifying system of QE
states will be represented by R. Each system is supposed
to be endowed with a ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space HX
and with the space B(HX ); X = R, Q, E, of bounded op-
erators. Even when Y represents a compound system, its
quantum states will be denoted by density operators ρY .
The tensorial extension to B(HQ ⊗ HE) = B(HQE) of a
map Λ deﬁned on B(HQ) will be denoted by Λ⊗idE, idX
being the identity map on B(HX ). If Λ is a positive map
and if Λ ⊗ idE preserves the positivity of operators de-
ﬁned on B(HQE) for all dimensions of HE, Λ is a CP
map. Partial traces and adjoint actions of unitary oper-
ators are the standard examples of CPTP maps.

Throughout this study the initial and ﬁnal states will
be denoted by indexed |ψi, ρ and |φi, σ, respectively. Su-
perscripts over them will indicate which system they be-
long to. They should be thought of also as indexed by
an initial time τ and ﬁnal time τ ′ ≥ τ . Accordingly,
U QE and related channels should be thought of as in-
dexed by both times leading to state vectors and oper-
ators at the initial time to that of at the ﬁnal time. At
the beginning QE is supposed to be in the state ρQE
and we denote the initial tripartite pure state by |ψRQEi
with ρQE = T rR|ψRQEihψRQE|. Deﬁning the adjoint
action of an operator V on ρ by adV (ρ) = V ρV †, the
output state is σRQE = (idR ⊗ adU QE )ρRQE. Hence R
remains blind and dead during the evolution. Since the
overall evolution is unitary, when the input state is pure

2

ρRQE = |ψRQEihψRQE| then so is the output σRQE =
|φRQEihφRQE| where |φRQEi = (IR ⊗ U QE)|ψRQEi (IX
stands for the unit operator, or the unit matrix of HX ).
In any case, the reduced dynamics of Q is speciﬁed by
tracing out the environment and the purifying system:

σQ = E(ρQ) = T rRE(σRQE ).

(1)

Now the important question is that, for what kind of
initial correlations of ρQE is the map E a CPTP map?
As a non-exhaustive answer to the above question in
what follows we shall prove that as long as the puriﬁca-
tion of the input QE state is a pure Markov state the
evolution map E is a CPTP map for every joint unitary
evolution of the QE composite in the presence of initial
correlations implied by the pure Markov state. This is
shown in Sec. IV where the explicit form of the channel
and its Kraus operators as well as identiﬁcation some spe-
cial cases of channel are presented. In Sec. III the nec-
essary entropy relations, Markov states, Petz map and
pure Markov states are introduced. Canonical form of
the pure Markov states and their characteristic traits are
also exhibited in Sec. III. The correlations such as entan-
glement of formation, discord and classical correlations
that the initial QE states may have are analyzed in Sec.
V. There it is shown that the entropy of the environment
entirely speciﬁes all these correlations. Our main points
concerning the CPTP evolutions and characterizations of
initial correlations are summarized by two theorems. In
the ﬁnal section intimate connections of our results with
perfect quantum error correction procedure and quantum
Markovian dynamics are discussed.

III. SSA RELATION, MARKOV STATES, PETZ

MAP AND PURE MARKOV STATES

The von Neumann entropy of a state ρY is deﬁned
by S(ρY ) = −T rρY log ρY : This will be denoted sim-
ply by S(Y ) = S(ρY ). The quantum conditional entropy
S(X|Y ) = S(XY ) − S(Y ) and the quantum mutual in-
formation S(X; Y ) deﬁned by

S(X; Y ) = S(X) + S(Y ) − S(XY ),

(2)

will be distinguished with special punctuation inside
the parenthesis. S(X; Y ) is zero iﬀ ρXY is the prod-
uct state ρXY = ρX ⊗ ρY , where ρX = T rY ρXY and
ρY = T rXρXY are the marginal states of ρXY .
information
S(R; E|Q), conditioned on Q, for a state of our tripar-
tite system RQE is deﬁned as S(R; E|Q) = S(R|Q) +
S(E|Q) − S(RE|Q). In view of the deﬁnition of condi-
tional entropy this takes the form

conditional mutual

Accordingly,

the

S(R; E|Q) = S(RQ) + S(QE) − S(RQE) − S(Q), (3)
and the celebrated SSA relation which hosts several en-
tropy relations can be expressed by S(R; E|Q) ≥ 0.

A tripartite state is a Markov state iﬀ it satisﬁes
S(R; E|Q) = 0. A key property of Markov states we
shall use is that: ρRQE is a Markov state iﬀ there exists
a CPTP map R : Q → QE such that
ρRQE = (idR ⊗ R)ρRQ,

where ρRQ = T rEρRQE (Eq. (11) of Ref.
[10] see also
[11]). On the support of ρQ = T rREρRQE the action of
R on any X ∈ B(HQ) is given by (Eq. (15) of Ref. [13])
(4)

R(X) = ad(ρQE )1/2(cid:2)(cid:0)ad(ρQ)−1/2X(cid:1) ⊗ IE(cid:3).

Note that for X = ρQ we have R(ρQ) = ρQE. That is R
locally reverses the action of T rE on ρQE.
Henceforth R will be referred to as the Petz map.
As is apparent from Eq.
(4), R can be considered
to be a composition of two CP maps: The ﬁrst is
of the form B(HQ) → B(HQE) and is deﬁned by
X → (ad(ρQ)−1/2X(cid:1) ⊗ IE and the second is of the
form B(HQE) → B(HQE) and is deﬁned by Y →
ad(ρQE )1/2 (Y ) for any Y ∈ B(HQE). By virtue of the
general relation T rE[Y (X ⊗ IE)] = (T rEY )X one can
easily verify that

T rQE[R(X)] = T rQn(T rEρQE)[(ρQ)−1/2X(ρQ)−1/2]o.
Thus, the Petz map R is indeed a quantum channel on
the support of ρQ. As it depends on the initial ρQ state,
R should be indexed by ρQ, but for the sake of clarity
this dependence is suppressed. When extended to all of
B(HQ) the Petz map can be considered as a trace-non-
increasing CP map [14].

A. Pure Markov states

For any tripartite pure state S(RQE) vanishes and
according to Schmidt decomposition the bipartite splits
R|QE, RQ|E and Q|RE imply the following equalities;
S(R) = S(QE), S(E) = S(RQ), S(Q) = S(RE).

Substituting these relations into Eq.
proves the following statement.

(3) immediately

Lemma 1. For any tripartite pure state the equality

S(R; E|Q) = S(R; E) holds. (cid:3)
That is, the conditional mutual information of any tri-
partite pure state, given Q, is just the mutual information
of R and E. Since being a product state is the necessary
and suﬃcient conditions for quantum mutual informa-
tion of a given bipartite state to vanish, as a corollary of
Lemma 1 we have the following fact which is a general
trait of all pure Markov states.

Corollary 1. Any tripartite pure state ρRQE =
|ψRQEihψRQE| is a Markov state iﬀ the marginal state
ρRE = T rQρRQE is the product state ρRE = ρR ⊗ ρE. (cid:3)

3

B. Canonical form of the pure Markov states

Evidently, a large family of the tripartite pure Markov
states can be generated by puriﬁcations of product states
of RE. By the Corollary 1 such a procedure certainly
produces a pure Markov state. To say more, let us con-
sider the product state ρRE = ρR ⊗ ρE. Denoting the
spectra of ρR and ρE by {κj} and {µk}

ρR = X

j

κj|rjihrj|,

ρE = X

k

µk|εkihεk|,

(5)

with the corresponding orthonormal eigenstates {|rji}
and {|εki} we have [15]

|ψRQEi = X

j,k

√κjµk|rji ⊗ |qjki ⊗ |εki.

(6)

Here {|qjki;hqmn|qjki = δjmδkn} represents the set of
orthonormal eigenstates of the corresponding state of Q:

ρQ = X

j,k

κjµk|qjkihqjk|.

(7)

, V †V = IQ) transformations of Q, that is

In fact, any tripartite pure state |Φi whose marginal
ρRE = T rQ|ΦihΦ| is a product state is, by deﬁnition, a
puriﬁcation of ρRE. Moreover |Φi is unique up to local
unitary (or, more generally, local isomorphism V : HQ →
HQ′
ρRE = T rQ|ΦihΦ| = T rQ(cid:2)(idR ⊗ adV ⊗ idE)|ΦihΦ|(cid:3).
Thus Eq. (6) is a canonical form characterizing all pure
Markov states and from the explicit form of diagonal
marginal states, or directly from (6) we have the follow-
ing statement.

Lemma 2. For a given pure Markov state the ranks of

its one-partite marginal states satisﬁes the equality:

rank(ρQ) = rank(ρE)rank(ρR).

(cid:3)

(8)

Some of immediate corollaries of this Lemma can be
directly stated as follows. When both R and E are in
some respective pure states then so is Q and we have a
pure Markov state as a pure product state. When only
one of R and E is in a pure state then the pure Markov
state has, irrespective of the rank(ρQ), one of the follow-
ing form;

ρRQE = 


|ϕRQihϕRQ| ⊗ |ψEihψE|,
|ϕRihϕR| ⊗ |ψQEihψQE|.

(9)

When the rank(ρQ) is a prime number then the above
two forms exhaust all possible forms of pure Markov
states. In particular, Eqs. (9) exhibit all possible pure
Markov states for qubit and qutrit states of Q. Moreover,
for any tripartite pure state of RQE, ρQE is a pure state
iﬀ so is ρR. When ρR is pure the tripartite pure state is

automatically a Markov state. Hence the second relation
of (9) exhausts the set of pure Markov states in which R
is in a pure state.

In the most general case neither QE nor RQ needs to
be in a pure state. Indeed, in terms of orthonormal states

|ψQE

i = X

k

|ψRQ

k

i = X

√µk|qjki ⊗ |εki, hψQE

√κj|rji ⊗ |qjki, hψRQ

i = δnk,

from Eq. (6) we obtain

ρQE = X

κj|ψQE

ρRQ = X

Thus when neither R nor E is in pure state, both ρQE
and ρRQ are mixed.

IV. PURE MARKOV STATES AND CP

EVOLUTIONS

From now on we consider our pure tripartite input
state ρRQE to be a pure Markov state obeying Corol-
lary 1 ; ρRE = ρR ⊗ ρE. To determine the output state
we ﬁrst compute ρRQ and write ρRQE = (idR ⊗ R)ρRQ.
Then the tripartite output can be written as

σRQE = (idR ⊗ adU QE )ρRQE

= (cid:2)idR ⊗ (adU QE ◦ R)(cid:3)ρRQ.

(11)

Here ◦ denotes the composition of maps. By writing
ρRQ in the block form ρRQ = Σij eij ⊗ Qij, where eij are
the matrix units of HR and ρQ = ΣjQjj , Eq.(11) can be
rewritten as follows σRQE = Σijeij ⊗ [U QER(Qij)U QE†]:
Taking partial trace over R leads us to
σQE = (adU QE ◦ R)(ρQ).

(12)

Tracing out the environment and comparing the result
with Eq. (1) proves the following statement which is the
ﬁrst main point of our study.

Theorem 1.

If the puriﬁcation of an initial system-
environment state ρQE, is a pure Markov state then the
evolution of Q is described by

σQ = E(ρQ),

E = T rE ◦ adU QE ◦ R,

(13)

where R is the Petz map given by Eq. (4). E is a CPTP
map on the support of initial system state ρQ for every
unitary joint evolutions U QE. (cid:3)

Partial traces, adjoint actions by unitary operators
(also by isometry operators) and the Petz map are all
CPTP maps, that is quantum channels. Since concatena-
tion of the quantum channels, is again a quantum chan-
nel, the evolution map E is a quantum channel on the
support of ρQ.

A. Kraus Operators

In view of Eq. (4) the action E(X) = T rE(cid:2)adU QE ◦

R(X)(cid:3) of E on any X ∈ B(HQ) can be written as
E(X) = T rEnadU QE (ρQE )1/2(cid:2)(cid:0)ad(ρQ)−1/2X(cid:1) ⊗ IE(cid:3)o.
Now we consider the orthonormal basis {|εℓi;hεk|εℓi =
δkℓ} completing the set of initial eigenvectors of the envi-
ronment to a complete set. Then by writing Pℓ |εℓihεℓ| =
IE and evaluating the T rE via the same basis we get
Kraus representation [5]

E(X) = X

k,ℓ

adEkℓ(X),

(14)

where the Kraus operators are obtained as follows

Ekℓ = hεk|U QE(ρQE)1/2|εℓi(ρQ)−1/2.

(15)

It should be emphasized that the ﬁrst index of Ekℓ ranges
over the whole basis of E and second index takes values
in the set of initial eigenvectors of E.

The Kraus operators encapsulate the knowledge of the
initial system-environment state and of the joint unitary
evolution. It is well-established general fact that a linear
map is CP iﬀ it is a sum of adjoint actions generated by
a set of Kraus operators. Making use of

(ρQE)1/2 = X

(16)

When Eq. (16) is inserted into Eq. (14) we obtain

(18)

ij = δij from Eq.

Noting that T rQEP QE
(16) we get
T rQE(X) = Pi T rQ(XΠi), with Πi = Πii, which im-
plies that E is trace-preserving for the operator deﬁned
on the support of ρQ denoted by supp(Q). Thus, the
trace preserving condition is equivalent to Pk,ℓ E†
kℓEkℓ =
Isupp(Q). In what follows when E is referred to as a chan-
nel this support restriction must be understood.

E(X) = E H (X) + T (X).

i = |ψQE

|, Eq.

(21)

(17), or equivalently Eq.

Eq.
(21) provides the must
general form of the channel implied by the pure Markov
states. These are given in the basis of the initial states of
Q and E. In these basis all the operators taking part in
both E H (X) and T (X) are independent from X. While
each operator appearing in the former is a state, entirely
determined by the joint unitary evolution and initial pure
P QE
states, all of the operators appearing in the latter
are traceless. These forms have also some remarkable
special cases to be mentioned.

i

In particular; when pij(X) = T rQ(XΠij ) = 0 for all
i 6= j, or when T (X) = 0 the channel has the form
E = E H . For this reason we would like to call the chan-
nel of the form (20) the Holevo channel [16] which is
known also as the entanglement braking channel [17].
In that case the output states are convex mixture of
i = T rE(cid:0)U QEP QE
σQ
i U QE †(cid:1) such that mixture fractions
depends on the input state.
Let us now consider the examples implied by the pure
Markov states given by Eq.
(9). The ﬁrst relation
ρRQE = |ϕRQihϕRQ|⊗|ψEihψE| of Eq. (9) represents the
puriﬁcation of initial uncorrelated system-environment
state considered in the majority of the related literature
which provides CPTP evolution for all joint unitary evo-
lutions. This is a pure Markov state in which the envi-
ronment is in the pure state |ψEi.
On the other hand, in the product state |ψRQEi =
|ϕRi ⊗ |ΨQEi of Eq. (9) we can consider |ΨQEi to be a
maximally entangled initial state of QE. Obviously the
marginal ρRE = |ϕRihφR| ⊗ IE/d, where d denotes the
complex dimension of HE, is a product state and ρQ and
ρE are maximally mixed. Hence the associated CPTP
map is deﬁned on the whole B(HQ). Since in this case R
is in a pure state, the indices i and j take only one value
and therefore can be suppressed to obtain

E(X) = T rQ(X)T rE(cid:0)U QEP QEU QE †(cid:1),

where P QE = |ψQEihψQE|. Thus E is a completely de-
polarizing channel mapping all states to a ﬁxed state
σQ = T rE(cid:0)U QEP QEU QE †(cid:1). Note that this is a special
case of the Holevo channel.

5

The rest of this study is devoted to characterization
of the initial system-environment correlations. It turns
out that the entropy S(E) of the environment play a
vital role in this context such that whenever it is nonzero
initial states of QE are correlated.

V.

INITIAL SYSTEM-ENVIRONMENT

CORRELATIONS

Our main goal in this section is to specify both quanti-
tatively and qualitatively quantum correlations and clas-
sical correlations of the joint system QE when it is in a
marginal state of a pure Markov state. The emphasize
will be put on the entanglement of formation, discord and
classical correlations and we ﬁrstly recall their deﬁnitions
for a generic bipartite state ρAB. Then, relationships be-
tween these information theoretical quantities will be es-
tablished for general tripartite pure states and ﬁnally the
relationships for the pure Markov states will be deduced
from them.

A. Entanglement of formation (EOF)

When ρAB is a pure state we have S(AB) = 0 and
S(A) = S(B), hence the entropy of a marginal state is
a natural quantitative measure of the entanglement of
a bipartite pure state. A given bipartite pure state is
entangled iﬀ the entropy of one of its marginal state is
diﬀerent from zero and it is maximally entangled iﬀ the
entropy of its marginal states are maximum [3, 6]. For a
given mixed state ρAB there is not so easy way of even
deciding the existence of entanglement. Perhaps the most
eﬃcient way is to deﬁne, again by means of the entropy
of a marginal state, say ρA, the EOF of ρAB by [18, 19]

B. An equivalent form of the EOF

For our purpose in this study we should convert the
conventional deﬁnition of EOF to another equivalent
form such that it will be possible to deal with EOF and
other measures of correlations on equal footing. For this
purpose we shall ﬁrstly replace the range of inﬁmum of
Eq. (22) with an equivalent set and secondly the average
entropy of Eq. (22) will be replaced with a more suitable
conditional entropy. To accomplish the ﬁrst replacement,

we note that any pure-state decomposition of a given den-
sity matrix can be obtained as the non-selective rank-1
POVM measurements locally carried out on its purify-
ing system. A POVM M is a collection of a complete
set of the POVM elements Mi each of which is positive
operator and is associated with a single measurement.
Let P RAB = |ΦRABihΨRAB| be a puriﬁcation of a
given ρAB and let ρAB = Pi piP AB
be a pure state de-
composition of it. We shall denote the rank-1 POVM
that produces this decomposition via its nonselective ac-
tion on R by the set

i

M = {0 ≤ Mi ≤ IR;X

i

Mi = IR}.

Rank-1 POVM means that Mi = |αiihαi| for all i such
that |αii’s need to be neither normalized nor orthogo-
nal. The explicit form of the correspondence between
the pure state decomposition and complete local execu-
tion of the POVM on the purifying reference system R
can be written as

condition for all the POVM elements Mi’s is suﬃcient
(as well as necessary) for the purity of all conditional
states P AB
(see Appendix A where this statement and
its converse are proved).

For the second replacement in the deﬁnition of EOF,
we observe that in terms of an orthonormal basis {|ii} of
an auxiliary Hilbert space HX to any pure-state decom-
positions (in fact, for any convex mixture) of ρAB is as-
sociated a classical-quantum state ρXAB = Pi pi|iihi| ⊗
P AB
the average
entropy Pi piS(ρA
i ) appearing in the deﬁnition (22) is
nothing more than the conditional entropy S(A|X) of
the state ρXA = Pi pi|iihi| ⊗ ρA
i . Thus we can rewrite
EOF given by (22) as follows

. In such a case, since ρA

i = T rBP AB

i

Ef (AB) = inf

M (cid:8)S(A|X); ρXA = X

pi|iihi| ⊗ ρA

i

This is our promise for the new equivalent deﬁnition of
EOF and it should be emphasized that here the inﬁmum
must be taken over all rank-1 POVMs acting on R.

C. Discord and classical correlations

The classical correlation C(R → B) between R and B
in the bipartite state ρRB = T rAP RAB can be speciﬁed
by means of the so called Holevo quantity

χ({pi, ρB

i }) = S(X

i

piρB

i ) − X

i

piS(ρB

i ),

of the state ρB = T rRAP RAB = Pi piρB
i . The Holevo
quantity is a fundamental upper bound for the accessi-
ble information between the sender and a reciver com-
municating classical messages by quantum means (The-
orem 5.9 of the Ref.
is the carrier of
the classical message i send with probability pi and the
receiver tries to read the message by POVM measure-
ments. In terms of the associated classical-quantum state
ρXB = Pi pi|iihi| ⊗ ρB
i }) can be rewritten as

i , χ({pi, ρB

[6]). Here ρB
i

χ({pi, ρB

i }) = S(X; B) = S(B) − S(B|X).

Now, the classical correlations C(R → B) are deﬁned by
maximizing the Holevo quantity over all rank-1 POVMs
executed on X;

C(R → B) = S(B) − inf

M

S(B|X).

(24)

Since Ef (AB) = Ef (BA) the second term at the right
hand side is the EOF given by Eq. (23). Thus, we have
proved the following fact.

Lemma 3. For any puriﬁcation ρRAB of a given bipar-
tite state ρAB, the EOF Ef (AB) for ρAB and the clas-
sical correlations C(R → B) between R and B always
obey the following equality

C(R → B) + Ef (AB) = S(B).

(cid:3)

(25)

This relation is known in the literature as the Koashi-
Winter relation [20] for which we have provided an alter-
native and instructive proof.

For later convenience in adopting these relations for
the pure Markov states, we simply change the label of
systems A and B, respectively by Q and E and consider
an arbitrary pure state ρRQE which need not be a Markov
state yet. For this case we rewrite Eq. (25) as

C(R → E) + Ef (QE) = S(E).

(26)

Making use of Eq. (2) and the relations implied by the
bipartite splits of ρRQE we have

S(R) =

S(Q) =

S(E) =

1
2
1
2
1
2

[S(R; Q) + S(R; E)],

[S(R; Q) + S(Q; E)],

(27)

[S(R; E) + S(Q; E)].

These simply state that entropy of any individual part
of any tripartite pure state is the arithmetic mean of
mutual information of that part with remaining other
two partners. Recalling the deﬁnition of discord [21]

D(Q → E) = S(Q; E) − C(Q → E)

(28)

between Q and E we can write two important corollaries
of Lemma 3.

Corollary 2. For any puriﬁcation ρRQE of a given bi-

partite state ρQE, the following equalities hold:

C(Q → E) + Ef (RE) = S(E),
S(R; E) − Ef (RE) + D(Q → E) = S(E).

(29)
(30)

Proof. The ﬁrst relation is obtained from Eq. (26) by
the interchange R ↔ Q and the second relation is the
diﬀerence of third relation of Eq. (27) and Eq. (29). (cid:3)

D. EOF, discord and classical correlations implied

by the pure Markov states

Having speciﬁed the quantum mechanical as well as the
classical correlations of any pure tripartite state in terms
of information theoretical quantities we are ready to ap-
ply these results to any pure Markov state ρRQE. Since
ρRE is a product state in this case; the mutual informa-
tion, the classical correlations and the EOF between R
and E are zero:

S(R; E) = 0 = Ef (RE) = C(R → E).

Thus Eqs. given by (26), (29) and (30) reduce to the
following forms

Ef (QE) = C(Q → E) = D(Q → E) = S(E).

That is, numerical values of considered correlations be-
tween Q and E are equal to each other and their value is
simply given by the entropy of the environment. More-
over Eqs. (27) take the forms

S(R) =

1
2

S(R; Q), S(E) =

1
2

S(Q; E),

and S(Q) = [S(R; Q) + S(Q; E)]/2 for any pure Markov
state. These observations can be summarized by the fol-
lowing theorem which emphasizes another general trait
of the pure Markov states.

Theorem 2. For any pure Markov state ρRQE; the
EOF, discord and classical correlations between the sys-
tem Q and its environment E are all numerically equal
to each other and to the entropy of the environment E
which is one-half of the mutual information of Q and E.(cid:3)
Eqs. (26) and (29) represent a kind of conservation law
for the correlations of an environment with the related
OQS and their purifying system. For a given S(E) both
C(R → E) and Ef (QE) (or C(Q → E) and Ef (RQ)) can
change (without exceeding the value S(E)) but their sum
is always ﬁxed by S(E). In the case of a pure Markov
state both C(Q → E) and Ef (QE) are equal to S(E)
which means that as long as S(E) 6= 0, Q and E are
certainly correlated and even in such a case the reduced
dynamics of Q can be described by a CPTP map.

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS

Finally we would like to present our remarks concern-
ing two seemingly diﬀerent topics; (i) perfect quantum
error correction (QEC) in quantum information theory
[22] and (ii) quantum non-Markovian (or Markovian) dy-
namics in the theory of OQSs [1, 23].

7

(i) Main point of the perfect QEC procedure is to faith-
fully restore the output state of a system Q to its input
state by means of local transformations executed at the
receiver side after Q has been sent through a noisy trans-
mission channel. For the transfer of quantum informa-
tion the input is supposed to be a part of an entangled
pure state with a reference system R and the noisy chan-
nel is modelled to arise, as usually, from a joint unitary
evolution of Q and its environment E which is supposed
to be in a pure state [24]. During the transmission pro-
cess, Q evolves as an open system and R remains intact
throughout the process. Thus tripartite framework and
uncorrelated initial QE state are essential in the present
perfect QEC scheme. Moreover, the initial tripartite
state is a special pure Markov state corresponding to our
ﬁrst relation of Eq. (9). What is more, being another
pure Markov state for the tripartite output suﬃces for
the accomplishment of perfect QEC [22]. Hence perfect
QEC procedure can be formulated as preserving the pure
Markov structure of the tripartite input state and we do
naturally expect that the results of this study can pro-
vide a broader perspective on the perfect QEC and on
the approximate QEC procedures.

(ii) Quantum non-Markovianity (and Markovianity) is
another central topic in the theory of OQSs. This can be
deﬁned via divisibility property of evolution maps [23]. A
quantum system Q subject to a time evolution given by
some family of trace-preserving linear maps {Eτ ′,τ ; τ ′ ≥
τ ≥ τ0} is Markovian (or divisible) iﬀ, for every τ ′ and τ
, Eτ ′,τ is a CPTP map and fulﬁls the composition law

Eτ ′′,τ = Eτ ′′,τ ′ ◦ Eτ ′,τ ,

τ ′′ ≥ τ ′ ≥ τ.

(31)

To establish a concrete connection with our work we re-
store time labelling of initial and ﬁnal states respectively
by τ and τ ′ as mentioned in Section II. As we have shown,
even in the presence of initial correlations the existence
of CPTP evolution Eτ ′,τ is guaranteed as long as the tri-
partite initial state is a pure Markov state. Although
the tripartite output at time τ ′ is a pure state σRQE
=
|φRQE
τ ′,τ )|ψRQE
i, it
need not be a pure Markov state. Hence there may not
be a CP map Eτ ′′,τ ′ after the time τ ′. According to the
Theorem 1, a suﬃcient conditions for this to be case is
that the reduced output

i = (IR ⊗ U QE

| where |φRQE

σRE
τ ′ = T rQ(cid:2)idR ⊗ (adU QE

(32)

being a product state. Whenever this occurs the exis-
tence of CPTP map Eτ ′′,τ ′ will be guaranteed. Thus,
we can say that an evolution which preserves the pure
Markov structure, that is, transforming a pure Markov
state to another one for all τ ′ is a Markovian evolution
for the observed system.

To sum up, the problems such as the reduced quantum
dynamics in the presence of initial system-environment
correlations, the Markovian and non-Markovian dynam-
ical evolutions and the perfect QEC and approximate
QEC procedures are very intimately connected. Pure

Markov states, or in a broader context Markov states
play a central role in these seemingly diﬀerent topics.

Appendix A

Let |ΥARi be a puriﬁcation of a given state ρA such
that ρA = T rRP AR with P AR = |ΥARihΥAR| and let
M = {0 ≤ Mi ≤ IR;Pi Mi = IR}, be a POVM on the
purifying system R. The conditional state ρA
i , known also
as the post-measurement state, resulting from a single
local measurement is given by

piρA

i = T rR(cid:2)(IA ⊗ pMi)P AR(IA ⊗ pMi)(cid:3),

(A1)

where pi = T rR(MiρR) is nonzero and ρR = T rAP AR .
Lemma A. The conditional state ρA
i deﬁned by (A1) is a
pure state iﬀ the POVM element Mi is of rank-1 [25].
Proof. Writing P AR = Pmn |ψmihψn| ⊗ |mihn| where
|ψmi is an eigenvector of ρA multiplied by the square root
of the corresponding eigenvalue λm (below the eigenvec-
tors will be freed from these factors) and {|mi} is an

piρA

i = X

mn

|ψmihψn|T rR(cid:0)Mi|mihn|(cid:1).

(A2)

is of rank-1 we can write Mi = |αiihαi|
When Mi
where nonzero |αii need not be normalized. Then by
deﬁning cim = hαi|mi from (A2) we have piρA
i =
in|ψmihψn|, where ∗ denotes the complex con-
Pmn cimc∗
jugation, and in terms of |Φii = Pm cim|ψmi we obtain
piρA

i = |ΦiihΦi|. Since ρR = Pmnhψn|ψmi|mihn| and
pi = T rR(MiρR) = X
inhψn|ψmi = hΦi|Φii,
in terms of the normalized |ϕii = |Φii/√pi we have ρA
i =
|ϕiihϕi|. Conversely, if ρA
i = |βiihβi| with hβi|βii = 1
then from (A1) we have

cimc∗

pi|βiihβi| = X

pλmλn|ψmihψn|(Mi)nm.

(A3)

Here {|ψmi} is the set of the orthonormal eigenvectors
of ρA corresponding to nonzero eigenvalues {λm} and
(Mi)nm = hn|Mi|mi denotes the matrix element of Mi
in the orthonormal basis {|mi} of R. In terms of bik =
ppi/λkhψk|βii from (A3) we obtain (Mi)kℓ = b∗
iℓbik
which implies Mi = |biihbi|, such that hbi|mi = bim. (cid:3)
