Universal metrics are the metrics that solve generic gravity theories which deﬁned
by covariant ﬁeld equations built on the powers of the contractions and the covari-
ant derivatives of the Riemann tensor. Here, we show that the Kerr-Schild–Kundt
class metrics are universal extending the rather scarce family of universal metrics
in the literature. Besides being interesting on their own, these metrics can provide
consistent background for quantum ﬁeld theory at extremely high energies.

INTRODUCTION

The ﬁeld equations of Einstein’s gravity, even in vacuum, are highly nonlinear, but still
there is an impressive collection of exact solutions: some describing spacetimes outside
compact sources, some describing nonlinear waves in curved or ﬂat backgrounds, and some
providing idealized cosmological spacetimes. According to the lore in eﬀective ﬁeld theories,
Einstein-Hilbert action will be modiﬁed or one might say quantum-corrected after heavy

degrees of freedom in the microscopic theory are integrated out with higher powers curvature
and its derivatives at small distances/high energies. The ensuing theory at a given high
energy scale could be a very complicated one with an action of the form

I = ˆ dDx√−gf (g, R,∇R, . . . ) ,

(1)

where f is a smooth function of its arguments, that are the metric and the Riemann tensor
denoted simply as R. Of course, it is quite possible that there are additionally nonminimally
coupled ﬁelds such as scalar ﬁelds taking part in gravitation. But, in what follows we shall
assume that this is not the case and gravity is simply due to the pseudo-Riemannian metric.
This UV-corrected theory is much more complicated than Einstein’s gravity, and so one
might have a priori very little hope of ﬁnding exact solutions. Of course, what is even worse
is that beyond the ﬁrst few terms in perturbation theory, we do not really know the form
of this modiﬁed theory at a given high energy scale. Hence, apparently, in the absence of
the ﬁeld equations, one may refrain from looking for solutions, but it turns out that the
situation is not hopeless: there is an interesting line of research that started some time ago
with the works [1–7] and culminated into a highly fertile research avenue. The idea is to
ﬁnd metrics, so called universal metrics [8], that solve all the metric-based ﬁeld equations
of quantum-corrected gravity, with slight modiﬁcations in the parameters that reﬂect the
underlying theory. The notion of universal metrics, with reﬁnements such as strongly and
weakly universal were made in [8], we shall not go into that distinction here and we shall also
not go into the distinction of critical versus non-critical metrics, where the former extremize
an action while the latter solve a covariantly conserved ﬁeld equation not necessarily coming
from an action. These universal metrics, in addition to being valuable on their own, provide
potentially consistent backgrounds for quantum ﬁeld theory at extremely high energies where
the backreaction or gravity of the quantum ﬁelds cannot be neglected. Universal Einsteinian
(vacuum or Einstein space) metrics are studied in the works [9–11]

From the above discussion, it should be clear that ﬁnding such universal metrics is a
highly nontrivial task; hence, in the literature, there does not exist many examples save the
ones we quoted above. But, recently, we have provided new examples of universal metrics:
we have shown that the AdS-plane wave [12, 13] (see also [14]) and the AdS-spherical wave
[15] metrics built on the (anti)-de Sitter [(A)dS] backgrounds solve generic gravity theories
with an action of the form (1) [16–19]. These previously found examples are in the form of
the Kerr-Schild metrics

where ¯gµν represents the (A)dS spacetime and the λ vector satisﬁes

gµν = ¯gµν + 2V λµλν,

λµλµ = 0,

∇µλν = ξ(µλν),

ξµλµ = 0,

λµ∂µV = 0.

(2)

(3)

Observe that a second vector ξ appears whose deﬁnition is given by the second relation
where the symmetrization convention is ξ(µλν) ≡ 1
2 (ξµλν + λµξν). Note also that the λ
vector is not a recurrent vector in general and hence the spacetime does not have the special
holonomy group Sim(D − 2) as was considered in [8]. With the second and third relations,
the null λ vector becomes nonexpanding, shear-free, and nontwisting; making (2) a Kundt
spacetime; therefore, we shall call this class of metrics to be the Kerr-Schild–Kundt (KSK)
In this work, we will prove that any metric (2) in this class is a universal metric,
class.
solving generic covariant ﬁeld equations coming from the variation of (1). More speciﬁcally,

3

we will show that for such metrics the ﬁeld equations can be written as a product of wave
equations of the form

where the operator O is deﬁned as

O ≡ (cid:3) + 2ξµ∂µ +

(5)

Therefore, any solution of O V = 0, which represents the Einsteinian solution, and
(O + bn) V = 0, for n = 1, 2,· · · , N. For example, N = 1 representing quadratic grav-
ity solutions, solve the generic theory. Also, bn are parameters related to the couplings, or
coeﬃcients in the Lagrangian. Unless they take special values, they do not play a signiﬁcant
role existence of solutions. Of course if they are not generic and if they coincide Log type
solutions appear with asymptotically non AdS behavior. As we have dealt with such issues
in other works such as [12], here we shall not consider particular cases but give a detailed
proof of how KSK metrics are universal.

The layout of the paper is as follows: In Section II, we give the curvature properties
of KSK metrics as well as the relations satisﬁed by the two special vectors. Section III
constitutes the bulk of the paper where we show that KSK metrics are universal. In the
Appendix, we give an alternative recursive path to this proof. As our claim is strong we
were compelled to give two proofs which can be can be read independently. The one in the
bulk of the paper is shorter but the one in the appendix comes with various examples that
will help the reader appreciate the construction.

II. CURVATURE TENSORS AND PROPERTIES OF KERR-SCHILD–KUNDT

CLASS

The properties of the KSK type metrics were previously discussed in [15, 17]. Here, we
shall brieﬂy recapitulate some of these which will be crucial in the proof and we shall also
give some additional constructions in this section. The scalar curvature of KSK metrics
are constant and normalized as R = −D (D − 1) /ℓ2 and the traceless-Ricci tensor, Sµν ≡
Rµν − R

D gµν, can be shown to satisfy

where the scalar ρ is calculated as

which make it clear that the Weyl tensor is λµCµανβ = 0. Observe that just like the metric
function V , due to the Bianchi identity and the constancy of the scalar curvature, one has
∇µSµν = 0 yielding

(10)

λµ∇µρ = 0,

which also follow from an explicit calculation using the deﬁnition (7) andλµ∇µV = 0.

Let us now calculate the Riemann tensor: using the deﬁnition

respectively. All of these expressions are exact even though the metric function appears
linearly, which shows the remarkable property of the Kerr-Schild metrics in addition to the
properties we have listed, deﬁning the KSK class. We shall make use of this form of the
Riemann tensor in the next section.

Finally, for the KSK metrics, we need the following identities: Once-contracted Bianchi

identity

for constant R yields

which then leads to

∇νRµανβ = ∇µRαβ − ∇αRµβ,

∇νRµανβ = ∇µSαβ − ∇αSµβ,

∇µ∇νRµανβ = (cid:3)Sαβ −

respectively, with the use of (19). Then, using (25) in (26) yields the second identity (20)
and putting the second identity back into (25) yields the third identity (21).

The identities (19) and (21) play a crucial role in the proof below because they represent
the fact that all possible contractions of ∇µξν with a λ vector yields a free index λ vector
and a reduction in the order of derivative on the ξ vector by one.

2 A variation of the identity (20) appeared in the App. B of [15] such that it involves covariant derivative
of AdS spacetime, that is ¯∇µ. Thus, another way to obtain (20) is to show ¯∇µξµ = ∇µξµ. This result
immediately follows from the fact that the Christoﬀel connection of AdS spacetime is related to the
Christoﬀel connection of the full metric as (see, for example, App. B of [15])

and using the fact that Ωµ

µβ = 0, one has ¯Γµ

µβ = Γµ

µβ.

The vector ∂µV also satisﬁes similar properties like ξµ: for both of these vectors, contrac-

tion with λµ is zero and contractions of ∇µ∂νV with a λ vector satisfy

(27)

where again a free index λ vector appears and the order of derivative on ∂µV reduces by
one.

III. UNIVERSALITY OF KSK METRICS

Here, we are going to prove the following theorem:

Theorem: For the Kerr-Schild metrics

gµν = ¯gµν + 2V λµλν,

with the properties

λµλµ = 0,

∇µλν = ξ(µλν),

ξµλµ = 0,

λµ∂µV = 0,

where ¯gµν is the metric of a space of constant curvature (AdS or dS). Then any
second rank symmetric tensor constructed from the Riemann tensor and its co-
variant derivatives can be written as a linear combination of gµν, Sµν, and higher
derivatives of Sµν in the form (cid:3)n Sµν where (cid:3) represents the d’Alembertian.

The proof of this theorem relies on the observation that any contraction of the λ vector with
any other tensorial form always yields a free-index λ vector or zero. Thus, in constructing
two-tensors out of the contractions of any number of Riemann tensor and its derivatives,
one must keep track of the number of λ vectors.

Let us consider a generic two-tensor which is constructed by any number of Riemann

tensors and its covariant derivatives and represent this two-tensor symbolically as

Eµν ≡ [Rn0 (∇n1R) (∇n2R) . . . (∇nmR)]µν ,

(28)

where R represents the Riemann tensor, the superscripts represent the number of terms
In the above
involved, and n1 < n2 < · · · < nm is assumed without loss of generality.
expression, we omitted the metric tensors among the terms, and in principle, any contraction
pattern is possible. The presence of these metric tensors does not alter any of our discussions
ni=1 ni should be even. Considering
the metric compatibility condition and using the form of the Riemann tensor in (12), Eµν
reduces to

below. It is obvious that to have a two-tensor the sum Pi=m

Eµν ≡ hλ2n0Θn0(cid:16)∇n1 hλ2Θi(cid:17)(cid:16)∇n2hλ2Θi(cid:17) . . .(cid:16)∇nmhλ2Θi(cid:17)iµν

,

(29)

where we omitted the metrics coming out of the Riemann tensors Rn0 since considering
them just yields a sum of two-tensor forms updated with λ2nr Θnr instead of λ2n0Θn0 where
nr < n0 always, so these terms are genuinely covered in Eµν.
Now, let us consider the tensorial structures appearing in Eµν. First, note that Θ deﬁned
in (13) is composed of V and its ﬁrst and second order derivatives in addition to the ξ

7

(30)

vector. Secondly, let us consider the highest order derivative term (∇nm [λ2Θ]) which is a
(0, nm + 4) rank tensor. Note that with each application of the covariant derivative on λ,
one can use ∇µλν = ξ(µλν); and therefore, (∇nm [λ2Θ]) represents a sum of (0, nm + 4) rank
tensors that are built up with V and its up to (nm + 2)th-order derivatives in addition to
ni=1 ni(cid:17) rank
the ξ vector and its nth
tensor,

m-order derivatives. Therefore, the (cid:16)0, s ≡ 4n0 + 4m +Pi=m

Eµ1...µs ≡ hλ2n0Θn0(cid:16)∇n1hλ2Θi(cid:17)(cid:16)∇n2hλ2Θi(cid:17) . . .(cid:16)∇nmhλ2Θi(cid:17)i ,

represents a sum of (0, s) rank tensors which are built up with 2 (n0 + m) number of λ
vectors and the remaining (0, s − 2n0 − 2m) rank tensorial parts are built up with V and its
up to (nm + 2)th-order derivatives in addition to the ξ vector and its nth
m-order derivatives.
After discussing the tensorial structure of Eµ1...µs, now let us analyze the nature of the
(s/2 − 1) number of contractions yielding Eµν. First, note that the contractions of the λµ
vector with λµ, ξµ, and ∂µV yield zero. Secondly, the contractions of the λµ vector with the
ﬁrst order derivatives of ξµ and ∂µV yield (19) and (21), and (27), respectively. In these
contractions, the important points to observe are:

• the number of λ vectors is preserved since a free-index λ always appears in the results,
• contraction of λ vector with the ﬁrst order derivatives acting on ξµ and ∂µV are

removed.

Now, let us analyze the λµ contraction of the terms involving higher order covariant deriva-
tives acting on ξµ and ∂µV . Note that to get the stated proof, instead of explicit formulae,
the tensorial structure of the expressions after the λµ contractions is important. Since λµ
contractions of both ξµ and ∂µV yield the same structure, we studied with ξµ; however, the
conclusions we obtained also applicable to the ∂µV case. Thus, let us consider the (0, r + 1)
rank tensor in the form

(31)

(32)

(33)

The λµ contraction can be through one of the covariant derivatives as

∇µ1∇µ2 . . .∇µr ξµr+1,

or through the ξ vector as

λµ∇µ1∇µ2 . . .∇µ . . .∇µr−1ξµr ,

λµ∇µ1∇µ2 . . .∇µr ξµ.

For these two contraction patterns, the tensorial structure of the ﬁnal results are: They are
the sums of (0, r) rank tensors satisfying the properties;

• each term involves a free-index λ vector,
• for all the terms, the highest order of derivative acting on ξ can be r − 1.

To show these properties, we need to use the basic identities (19) and (21), and to make
such a use, ﬁrst one needs to change the orders of the derivatives in (32) such that one has

λµ∇µ1∇µ2 . . .∇µr−1∇µξµr ,

(34)

by using the Ricci identity yielding Riemann tensors for each change of order. After making
all the change of orders and applying simply the product rule for the covariant derivatives,
one arrives at

λµ∇µ1∇µ2 . . .∇µ . . .∇µr−1ξµr = λµ∇µ1∇µ2 . . .∇µr−1∇µξµr +Xp

λµ (∇pRµ)(cid:16)∇r−p−2ξ(cid:17) , (35)

8

where in the last sum, λµ (∇pRµ) term represents p number of covariant derivatives acting
on the Riemann tensor and one index of the Riemann tensor should be contracted with
λµ. Here, p can have various limits depending on the position of the contracted covariant
derivative in (32) and it can be as small as 0 and as large as (r − 2). Once we consider the
Riemann tensor R symbolically as λ2Θ, then

λµ (∇pRµ) = λµ(cid:18)∇phλ2Θiµ(cid:19) ,

(36)

represents a sum of terms involving two free-index λ vectors and the remaining (0, p + 1)-
rank tensor structure is built up with the ξ, ∂V vectors, and their covariant derivatives.
In each term in this summation, one higher order covariant derivative term involving ξ or
∂V must have a λµ contraction. The derivative order of this λµ contracted term is at most
(r − 1) for the ∂V vector and (r − 2) for the ξ vector. This is because Θ involves the ﬁrst
derivative of the ∂V vector and just the ξ vector itself, and p can take the maximum value
of (r − 2). To summarize, for the last sum in (35), the properties of the tensorial structure
of each term is:

• there are three λ vectors one of which is in contracted form and the others are free,
• the total number of derivatives in these terms is at most (r − 1) for ∂V and (r − 2)

for ξ, so the derivative order is reduced by 1,

so for these terms, we achieved to show the aimed two properties.

Now, let us focus on the ﬁrst term in (35) and (33). For these terms, we need to change

the order of covariant derivatives and the λµ vector such that in the end we obtain

∇µ1∇µ2 . . .∇µr−1 (λµ∇µξµr ) ,
∇µ1∇µ2 . . .∇µr−1 (λµ∇µr ξµ) ,

(37)

(38)

respectively, and we can apply the identities (21) and (19) in these terms, receptively. To
show how we carry out this simple change of orders, we consider the ﬁrst term in (35) and the
same steps apply for (33). In changing orders of the λµ vector and the covariant derivatives,
we simply have

λµ∇µ1∇µ2 . . .∇µr−1∇µξµr = ∇µ1 (cid:16)λµ∇µ2 . . .∇µr−1∇µξµr(cid:17) − (∇µ1λµ)∇µ2 . . .∇µr−1∇µξµr ,

(39)
where in the second term on the right-hand side, one can apply the deﬁning property of the
ξ vector ∇µλν = ξ(µλν) which reduces the derivative order and introduces a free λ vector.
Then, one has

λµ∇µ1∇µ2 . . .∇µr−1∇µξµr =∇µ1(cid:16)λµ∇µ2 . . .∇µr−1∇µξµr(cid:17)
ξµ1λµ∇µ2 . . .∇µr−1∇µξµr
λµ1ξµ∇µ2 . . .∇µr−1∇µξµr ,

(40)

where for the last term we achieved our aim that

• a free-index λ vector is introduced,

• the derivative order on ξµr is reduced by one.

On the other hand, the second term in (40) still involves a λµ contraction; but this time,
the order of the derivative acting on ξµr is (r − 1). For this term, one needs to repeat this
ongoing process for the generic rth-derivative term. For the next step of the change of orders,
we consider the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side (40) and change the order of λµ and ∇µ2
as

9

λµ∇µ1∇µ2 . . .∇µr−1∇µξµr =∇µ1∇µ2 (cid:16)λµ∇µ3 . . .∇µr−1∇µξµr(cid:17)

(41)

Here, again using ∇µλν = ξ(µλν) in the second and third terms yield either λµ contracted
terms having less number of derivatives than r acting on ξ or terms involving a free-index λ
vector. Again for the terms involving λµ contraction this ongoing procedure can be repeated.
Thus, one can continue changing the order of the λµ vector and the covariant derivatives in
the ﬁrst term until one arrives at

which reduces to

∇µ1∇µ2 . . .∇µr−1 (λµ∇µξµr ) ,

∇µ1∇µ2 . . .∇µr−1 "−λµr   1

(43)

after applying (21). This term after the use of ∇µλν = ξ(µλν) yields a sum of terms involving
a free-index λ vector, and for each term, the derivative order on the ξ vectors are always
less then r. With these considerations, (32) term turns to a sum in which each term either
involves a free-index λ vector or a λµ contraction but for these terms the order of covariant
derivatives acting on the ξ vector is always less than r. For the latter kind of terms, one
can repeat this ongoing procedure until to the point of totally having terms involving a
free-index λ vector, and so no λµ contractions. The procedure that we discussed for (32)
can be applicable to the (33) contraction pattern for which the only change will be the
application of (19) instead of (21). Similarly, the analysis of a generic term involving the rth
order covariant derivatives acting on ∂µV instead of ξµ is exactly the same.

As a result, the λµ contraction of a generic term involving the rth-order covariant deriva-

tive of either the ξ vector or the ∂V vector turns to a sum involving terms satisfying:

• each term involves a free-index λ vector,
• in each term, the derivative order acting on ξ or ∂V vectors are always less than r,

which are the aimed properties.

With this result, let us discuss contractions in Eµν or more explicitly,

Eµ1...µs(cid:21)µν

,

10

(44)

Eµν = (cid:20)(cid:16)g−1(cid:17)s−1

where g−1 represents the inverse metric. It is clear that any nonzero contraction of 2 (n0 + m)
number of λ vectors in (30) with the other tensorial parts involving derivatives of ξ and ∂V
vectors always produces a free-index λ vector and reduces the derivative order. Thus, after
every nonzero λ contraction, the number of λ free-index vectors is preserved as 2 (n0 + m),
and obviously, one cannot avoid having a nonzero contraction once one reduces the (0, s)-
rank tensor Eµ1...µs to a (0, 2n0 + 2m)-rank tensor, whose free indices are only on the λ
vectors, and Eµν takes the form

Eµν = (cid:20)(cid:16)g−1(cid:17)n0+m−1

λ2(n0+m)(cid:21)µν

,

(45)

which gives zero for n0 + m > 1. After this observation, the only remaining possibility of
having a nonzero two-tensor out of Eµ1...µs is having only two λ one-forms from the outset,
so either n0 = 1 or m = 1, implying the presence of only one Riemann tensor in Eµ1...µs.
Thus, the generic forms of a nonzero two-tensor are

[R]µν ,

[∇nR]µν ,

(46)

where n is even and [R]µν just represents the Ricci tensor while the second term represents
a two-tensor contraction of

∇µ1∇µ2 . . .∇µnRν1ν2ν3ν4.

In analyzing two-tensor contractions of (47), the important observation is that in the process
of obtaining a nonzero two-tensor, one can freely change the order of the covariant derivatives
by use of the Ricci identity since all the additional terms involving a second Riemann tensor
just yields a zero at the two-tensor level as we just proved.3 In obtaining a nonzero two-tensor
out of (47), one can have the contraction possibilities either

contraction or

∇µ1 . . .∇ν1 . . .∇ν3 . . .∇µnRν1ν2ν3ν4,

∇µ1∇µ2 . . .∇µnRν1ν2,

and for both, the following contractions of the covariant derivatives are between themselves.
Because ∇µ1∇µ2 . . .∇µnR is zero as R is constant and

∇µ1 . . .∇ν1 . . .∇µnRν1ν2,

(50)

yields a zero since one can change the orders of covariant derivatives till obtaining
In (48), one can change the order of derivatives by the Ricci identity
∇µ1 . . .∇µn∇ν2R.
to obtain

3 Note that for an order change involving the ﬁrst two derivatives, there is a possibility of having an

additional nonzero term in the form (cid:2)∇n−2R(cid:3)µν due to the metric part in the Riemann tensor (11).

where we used (17). Note also that (49) becomes

(52)
The remaining (n − 2) number of free-indices in the covariant derivatives of (51) and (52)
can be rearranged such that one has

it may seem that there are the possibilities of having additional nonzero terms due to the
metric part in (11). But, one never needs such a change since for a term in the form

∇µ1∇µ2 . . .∇µ1 . . .∇µnSν1ν2,

one may only move ∇µ1 to obtain

(cid:3)∇µ2 . . .∇µnSν1ν2.

(55)

As a result, a generic two-tensor Eµν which is constructed from any number of Riemann
tensors and its covariant derivatives can be written as a sum of Rµν and higher derivatives
of Sµν in the form (cid:3)n Sµν. This proves the theorem. In the Appendix, we give the main
steps towards another, mathematical induction based, proof of the theorem.

The ﬁeld equations of the generic gravity theory with the action (1) is a symmetric

two-tensor Eµν which can be written as

as an immediate consequence of the proved theorem. Taking the trace of this equation yields
a scalar equation

IV. CONCLUSION

We have shown that the Kerr-Schild–Kundt class of metrics, which is deﬁned by the
relations (2) and (3) are universal in the sense that they solve the most general quantum-
corrected gravity equations based on the metric tensor, the Riemann tensor and its arbitrary
number of covariant derivatives and their powers. Our proof here boils down to showing that
a generic two-tensor built out of the contractions of the Riemann tensor and its covariant
derivatives can be written as a symmetric, covariantly-conserved, two-tensor (Eµν) for the
KSK-class in the form

N

an(cid:3)n Sµν,

(62)

Eµν = egµν +

Xn=0

where e and an are parameters, constants, of the theory. One further reduction gives the
product of scalar wave type equations, generically one of them is massless and the rest are
massive. Of course, one must still solve these equations to actually ﬁnd explicit solutions:
namely, one must determine the metric function V . We have not done this in the current
work because, earlier, we already gave examples of these metrics such as the AdS-plane and
AdS-spherical waves as solutions to quadratic and generic gravity theories [12, 15, 18]. In
[19], we give a systematic way of constructing solutions, such universal metrics, from curves
living in one less dimension.

In this Appendix, for a second proof alternative to the one given in the bulk of the
paper, we give necessary recursion relations satisﬁed by the tensors in KSK spacetimes. A
generic two-tensor constructed out of the Riemann tensor and its covariant derivatives can
be represented as

We need understand the contractions of λ with these building blocks. For this purpose, we
need the following deﬁnitions:

where (r1, r2, . . . , rm−1) is an increasing sequence constructed with the elements of

Deﬁnition – λ-weight of a tensor: A tensor E of rank (0, m) has λ-weight n if it can
be written as a linear combination of (0, m) rank tensors which can be decomposed into n
number of λ vectors and rank (0, m − n) tensors F (s) which are not λ-reducible, that is

these n-element subsets, and (r1, r2, . . . , rm−n) is an increasing sequence constructed with

Deﬁnition – λ-conserving tensor: Let E be an λ-weight n tensor of rank (0, m). The E
tensor is λ-conserving if its λ-weight increases by one after each nonzero contraction with λ.

its λ-weight becomes 1 as

and again a further λ-contraction with any of the above contraction patterns of ∇µ1∇µ2ξµ3
yields zero.

Corollary: For a λ-conserving tensor of rank (0, m) and λ-weight n, the maximum num-
ber of nonzero λ contractions is (m − n) /2 for even (m − n) and (m − n − 1) /2 for odd
(m − n).
Proof: Under p number of λ contractions, a λ-conserving E tensor of λ-weight n and rank
(0, m) yields a λ-weight (n + p) tensor of rank (0, m − p) in the form

This result implies that the maximum number of λ contractions is (m − n) /2 for even
(m − n) and (m − n − 1) /2 for odd (m − n). Then, one gets the following results, respec-
tively;

for a λ-conserving tensor E, λµsFµs should be zero.

Corollary: For an λ-conserving tensor of rank (0, m) and λ-weight n, the contractions
between its indices do not change the λ-weight.

where (r1, r2, . . . , rm−n) is an increasing sequence constructed with the elements of

are λ-conserving
since E is λ-conserving. Then, contractions between the indices of E can be either λ-λ
contraction, or λ-F contraction, or a contraction between the indices of F tensor. The λ-λ
contraction is zero. A contraction between the indices of F tensor surely does not change
λ-weight. Finally, the result of each λ-F contraction increases λ-weight by one, so the total
λ-weight still remains as n.

Proposition-V.B.1-1: The rank (0, n) tensor ∇n−1ξ is λ-conserving.
Proof: Let us introduce the indices of ∇n−1ξ as

 n−1
Yi=1 ∇µi! ξµn ≡ ∇µ1∇µ2 . . .∇µn−1ξµn.
To show ∇n−1ξ being λ-conserving, ﬁrst let us prove that λµj (cid:16)Qn−1
i=1 ∇µi(cid:17) ξµn, where j takes
a value from {1, 2, . . . , n}, is λ-reducible by using mathematical induction. As the basis set
of identities, we know that ∇µλν = ξ(µλν) and ξ satisﬁes the identities

and

λµ1ξµ2ξµ2.

Then, moving to the mathematical induction proof:

1. For n = 3, λµj (cid:16)Q2

i=1 ∇µi(cid:17) ξµ3 involves the contraction patterns
λµ1∇µ1∇µ2ξµ3,

λµ2∇µ1∇µ2ξµ3,

λµ3∇µ1∇µ2ξµ3.

(A16)

(A17)

The ﬁrst contraction pattern reduces to the second one by interchanging the order of
derivatives as

λµ1∇µ1∇µ2ξµ3 = λµ1 [∇µ1,∇µ2] ξµ3 + λµ1∇µ2∇µ1ξµ3
= λµ1Rµ1µ2µ3µ4ξµ4 + λµ1∇µ2∇µ1ξµ3,

(A18)

16

and from (B27) of [15], one has

λµ1∇µ1∇µ2ξµ3 =

R

D (D − 1)

λµ3ξµ2 + λµ1∇µ2∇µ1ξµ3.

(A19)

Thus, if the second contraction pattern is λ-reducible, then so is the ﬁrst one. Moving
to the second contraction pattern which becomes

λµ2∇µ1∇µ2ξµ3 =∇µ1 (λµ2∇µ2ξµ3) − (∇µ1λµ2) ∇µ2ξµ3
ξµ1λµ2∇µ2ξµ3 −

and using the identity for λµ2∇µ2ξµ3, one gets
R
λµ2∇µ1∇µ2ξµ3 = −

λµ3ξµ2∇µ1ξµ2,
(A21)
which is λ-reducible. With this result, the ﬁrst contraction is also λ-reducible and it
takes the form

5 Note that in this form, we only updated the superscript of E(k,n−1,j) to E(k−1,n−1,j−1) during the change
in the range of i (and so in k). Because the ﬁrst and the third labels of E(k,n−1,j) correspond to the
position of the contracted index and the position of the index of λµk
between the indices on the left-hand
side. With this update, the labeling still corresponds to the correct terms in the lower order term. This
enabled us to relate E(k,n,j)’s to E(k,n−1,j)’s.

cursion relations. This is a trivial check since we use the same way to calculate
λµ1∇µ1∇µ2∇µ3ξµ4, but it is worth as it is the veriﬁcation of the recursion relations
at the ﬁrst nontrivial order. Thus, λµ1∇µ1∇µ2∇µ3ξµ4 can be calculated in terms of

(A92)

Note that contracting the (0, n) rank tensor ∇n−1ξ with λ reduces the derivative order
such that the highest derivative order term now becomes ∇n−2ξ.

Now, let us discuss the contractions of ∇n−1ξ with more than one λ. In this regard, the
important thing that should be noticed in the one-λ contraction result is that the building
blocks of the tensor structures produced by the one-λ contraction of ∇n−1ξ, which are
metric, ξ, and lower order derivatives of ξ, are all λ-reducible under one-λ contraction. For
a further λ contraction, when the λ tensor is contracted with the derivatives of ξ, again the
lower order derivatives of ξ will appear together with the metric and ξ as building blocks.
Due to continuous appearance of the same λ-reducible building blocks, ∇n−1ξ should be
λ-conserving.

28

To be more explicit, let us ﬁrst consider contraction of the (0, n) rank tensor ∇n−1ξ with

two λ vectors; that is

λµj1 λµj2  n−1

Yi=1 ∇µi! ξµn,

(A93)

where {j1, j2} is a subset of {1, 2, . . . n}. Using the one-λ contraction result (A29), one has

should be one order less than the highest derivative order for the

Further λ contractions of ∇n−1ξ also have the same pattern: contracting the rank (0, n)

As an example for the odd n case, one can simply consider ∇∇ξ for which one λ contractions
that we found in (A21, A22, A24) are the last nonzero terms. It can be veriﬁed immediately
that a further λ contraction with any of the one-λ contraction patterns of ∇∇ξ given in
(A21, A22, A24) yields zero. For even n case, let us consider ∇3ξ for which two λ contraction
is the last nonzero order. As an example, let us study a further λ contraction of the j1 = 1
contraction pattern of ∇3ξ given in (A78), so after a long calculation λµ1λµ2∇µ1∇µ2∇µ3ξµ4
reduces to

To conclude, the (0, n) rank tensor ∇n−1ξ is λ-conserving since with each λ contraction,

which is, as expected, the last nonzero order constructed from the building blocks ξµ and
∇µξν.
the λ-weight of the resulting tensor structure increase by one.
Proposition-V.B.1-2: The rank (0, n) tensor ∇nV is λ-conserving.
Proof: The proof is similar to the one given above; hence, we do not put it here.
