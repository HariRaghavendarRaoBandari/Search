GROUP DUALITIES, T-DUALITIES, AND TWISTED

K-THEORY

VARGHESE MATHAI AND JONATHAN ROSENBERG

Abstract. This paper explores further the connection between Langlands du-
ality and T-duality for compact simple Lie groups, which appeared in work of
Daenzer-Van Erp and Bunke-Nikolaus. We show that Langlands duality gives
rise to isomorphisms of twisted K-groups, but that these K-groups are trivial
except in the simplest case of SU(2) and SO(3). Along the way we compute
explicitly the map on H 3 induced by a covering of compact simple Lie groups,
which is either 1 or 2 depending in a complicated way on the type of the groups
involved. We also give a new method for computing twisted K-theory using the
Segal spectral sequence, which is better adapted to many problems involving
compact groups. Finally we study a duality for orientifolds based on complex
Lie groups with an involution.

1. Introduction

This paper was motivated by a number of rather diverse sources, especially the
very intriguing papers [20, 18], which point out an interesting connection between
Langlands duality (which appears in representation theory and number theory) and
T-duality (a relationship between string theories on diﬀerent spacetime manifolds,
especially when these are torus bundles over a common base). A second source
comes from the extensive literature on WZW (Wess-Zumino-Witten) models in
physics, which appear both as conformal ﬁeld theories and as string theories (sigma
models, to be precise) whose underlying spacetime manifold is a Lie group, usually
compact and simple. In string theories in general, D-brane charges are expected to
take their values in twisted K-theory of spacetime, so the study of WZW models
led to the study of twisted K-theory of compact Lie groups, ﬁrst by physicists (e.g.,
[53, 48, 26, 12, 14, 15, 32]) and later by mathematicians (Hopkins, unpublished, but
quoted in [48], and Douglas [23]). The third motivation comes from the problem of
trying to understand exactly what one should expect from a “duality theory” for

WZW models. All three of these topics come together in the problems discussed
in this paper.

Section 2 deals with the connection between Langlands duality and T-duality.
The papers [20, 18] show that on any compact simple Lie group G not of type Bn or
Cn (n ≥ 3)1, there is a class h ∈ H 3(G) for which the “T-dual” of the torus bundle
G → G/T is the Langlands dual G∨ with a dual class h∨ ∈ H 3(G∨). However,
these papers give a description of h which is rather indirect, and which doesn’t
make it completely clear how it relates to the generator of H 3(G). (The group
H 3(G) is inﬁnite cyclic except for the exceptional case of PSO(2n) for n divisible by
2; even in this case, H 3(G) has an inﬁnite cyclic summand which is almost unique.)
Secondly, we realized that there doesn’t seem to be an explicit description in the

literature of the pull-back map from H 3(G) to H 3(eG), eG the universal cover of G,

so we provide this in Section 2.1, Theorems 1 and 3. The results are surprisingly
intricate. The following Sections 2.2 and 2.3 deal with making the choice of h
and h∨ more precise, to the point where the twisted K-theory K •(G, h) 2 can be
computed explicitly in Theorem 11. Section 2.4 then revisits the topic of computing
twisted K-theory K •(G, h), for arbitrary choices of h. This has been the subject
of an extensive literature, most notably [48, 53, 14, 23], and the results are rather
complicated and hard to understand. However, this is an important problem
because of the connection, discovered by physicists, between these twisted K-
groups and fusion rings and representations of loop groups. We therefore present
in Section 2.4 an easier way of computing these twisted K-groups in some cases.
Theorems 14, 16, and 17 recover some of the results of [14, 23] via much more
elementary methods, and Theorems 18 and 20 illustrate how the same methods
can be used in the case of non-simply connected Lie groups, where the literature is
still very incomplete. Section 2.5 applies this to level-rank duality. Finally, Section
3 and Theorem 22 deal with a duality theory for orientifolds based on complex Lie
groups with a group involution (either holomorphic or anti-holomorphic).

2. Langlands duality and the twisted K-theory of simple compact

Lie groups

2.1. The canonical class in H 3. In this subsection, we consider what at ﬁrst
sight appears to be a rather trivial and also somewhat esoteric question. Suppose
G is a connected simple compact Lie group, not isomorphic to PSO(2n) with n

even, with universal cover eG. Since it is a classical fact that eG is 2-connected, with
π3(G) = π3(eG) ∼= Z, it follows that H 3(G) and H 3(eG) are both inﬁnite cyclic, i.e.,
isomorphic to Z.3 Let π : eG → G be the covering map; its degree d divides the

2This notation will always mean complex topological K-theory twisted by the class h ∈ H 3.
3Throughout the paper, homology and cohomology groups will be taken with integer coeﬃ-
cients unless speciﬁed otherwise. The statement about H 3(G) follows from considering the Serre

spectral sequence for the ﬁbration eG → G → K(π1(G), 1) and using the fact that π1(G) is cyclic,

the adjoint group for its Lie algebra. Thus if G is of adjoint type, d is n+1 for type

and 2 for type E7.

determinant of the Cartan matrix of G, and is equal to it in case G = eG/Z(eG) is
An (eG = SU(n + 1)), 2 for type Cn (eG = Sp(n)), 2 for type Bn (G = SO(2n + 1)),
The fact that H 3(G) and H 3(eG) are both inﬁnite cyclic means that π∗ : H 3(G) →
H 3(eG) sends a generator of H 3(G) to some positive multiple of a generator of
H 3(eG). What multiple is this? The following theorem largely answers this ques-

tion. Note incidentally that this question was taken up in [24, Appendix 1], where
it was pointed out that there is a natural exact sequence

However, this doesn’t completely settle things since there is an extension problem
— it is not clear when this exact sequence splits, or when it “partially splits.”

0 → H3(eG) π∗−→ H3(G) → π1(G) → 0.

Theorem 1. Let G be a connected simple compact Lie group of rank n, with

Z → Z.

universal cover eG, with G not isomorphic to PSO(2n) with n even, and let d be
the degree of the covering π : eG → G. Think of π∗ : H 3(G) → H 3(eG) as a map

(1) If G is of type An and if n + 1 = 2q with q odd, then π∗ is multiplication by
2 if d is even and the identity if d is odd. If n + 1 is either odd or divisible
by 4, then π∗ is the identity.

G = PSp(n), then π∗ is the identity if n is even and is multiplication by 2
if n is odd.

(2) If G is of type Cn and π is not an isomorphism, i.e., eG = Sp(n) and
(3) If G = SO(2n) and eG = Spin(2n) with n ≥ 3, or if G = SO(2n + 1) and
eG = Spin(2n + 1) with n ≥ 2, or if G = PSO(2n) and eG = Spin(2n) with

n ≥ 3 odd (so G is of type Dn or Bn, though we are excluding one other
possibility for G in type Dn when n is even), then π∗ is the identity.

(4) If G is the adjoint group of E6, then π∗ is the identity, but if G is the

adjoint group of E7, then π∗ is multiplication by d = 2.

Proof. First recall that (by [1, Ch.

4], for example) there is a transfer map

that means there are only two possibilities: either π∗ is multiplication by d or else
it is the identity.

π∗ : H 3(eG) → H 3(G) such that π∗ ◦ π∗ is multiplication by d. So if d is prime,
(1) One case is obvious — if G has rank 1, so that eG ∼= SU(2) ∼= Sp(1) ∼=

Spin(3), then the only nontrivial covering map is π : SU(2) → SO(3), and this
can be identiﬁed with the 2-to-1 covering map S3 → RP3. But a covering map of

so that we know its integral cohomology. There is one exceptional case: if G = PSO(2n) with n
even, then π1(G) ∼= (Z/2)×(Z/2) and the same spectral sequence shows that H 3(G) ∼= Z⊕(Z/2).
The torsion generator of H 3(G) is killed on passage to the double cover SO(2n).

connected compact oriented k-manifolds induces multiplication by the degree of
the covering on H k, so in this case π∗ sends the generator of H 3(RP3) to twice a
generator of H 3(S3).

For the remaining cases, observe that the (n+ 1)-fold covering map SU(n+ 1) →
PSU(n + 1) factors through G. So when π∗ = 1 for the adjoint group PSU(n + 1),
then the same will be true for G as well. Next suppose that n + 1 = 2q with
q odd and we know that π∗ = 2 when G = PSU(n + 1). Of the two coverings
SU(n + 1) → G and G → PSU(n + 1), exactly one is of even degree, and the π∗
maps for these two coverings must multiply together to give 2. Since π∗ for any
covering divides the order of the covering, the only possibility is that π∗ is 2 for
the even covering and 1 for the odd covering. So the result is reduced to the case
G = PSU(n + 1).

Now we apply a result of Baum and Browder [6, Corollary 4.4]: if f : U(n+1) →
PSU(n + 1) is the quotient map (recall that PSU(n + 1) = U(n + 1)/Z(U(n + 1))),
then f ∗, the induced map on cohomology with Fp coeﬃcients, for any prime p
dividing n + 1, has kernel equal to the ideal generated by the generator y of
H 2(PSU(n + 1), Fp). Also note that the diagram

SU(n + 1)

π

'❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖

f

commutes, and since ι∗ : H 3(U(n + 1)) → H 3(SU(n + 1)) is an isomorphism, this
identiﬁes the kernel of π∗ : H 3(PSU(n + 1), Fp) → H 3(SU(n + 1), Fp) as well.

We recall from [10, Th´eor`eme 11.4] and [6, Corollary 4.4] that if n + 1 = prm,

with p prime and gcd(m, p) = 1, then
(1) H •(PSU(n + 1), Fp) ∼= Fp[y]/(ypr

) ⊗V(x1, x3, · · · , \x2pr −1, · · · , x2n+1),

with βx1 = y (β the Bockstein) and with the xj’s except for x1 all reductions of
integral classes. If p = 2 and r = 1, one has the additional relation x2
1 = y. So, in
all cases,

H 3(PSU(n + 1), Fp) = Fp x1y + Fp x3 (if present).

We have β(x3) = 0 and β(x1y) = y2.

There are a few cases to consider. If p is odd, then pr ≥ 3 and 2pr − 1 > 3. So
x3 is not omitted, y2 6= 0, and x1y is not the reduction of an integral class. Hence
no integral class in H 3(PSU(n + 1)) reduces to something nonzero in the kernel of
f ∗ on mod p cohomology. Hence π∗ : H 3(PSU(n + 1)) → H 3(SU(n + 1)) is never
divisible by an odd prime.

Next, suppose n + 1 = 2q with q odd.

If we choose p = 2, then r = 1, so
x3 is missing in (1), and y2 = 0. So x1y is the reduction of the generator of
H 3(PSU(n + 1)) in this case, and it lies in the kernel of f ∗. Hence π∗ is divisible

by 2. Since we have already shown it is not divisible by any odd prime, it is exactly
2.

Finally, consider the case p = 2 when n + 1 is divisible by 4. In this case, pr ≥ 4
so, again, 2pr − 1 > 3. So x3 is present in (1), and y2 6= 0, so that x1y is not the
reduction of an integral class. Hence the kernel of f ∗ does not contain the nonzero
reduction of any integral cohomology class, and π∗ cannot be divisible by 2. Since
it is also not divisible by any odd prime, p∗ = 1 in this case.

G = PSO(6).

Note that since A3 = D3, PSU(4) = PSO(6). So π∗ = 1 in the case eG = Spin(6),
(2) The case G = PSp(n), eG = Sp(n), n ≥ 2, is handled using [10, Th´eor`eme

11.3], which gives

(2)

with a of degree 1 and s the largest power of 2 dividing n. Note that 4s = 4 if n is
odd and 4s ≥ 8 if n is even. The Bockstein β = Sq1 sends a to a2, and all torsion
is of order 2, so the integral cohomology is

H •(PSp(n), F2) ∼= F2[a]/(a4s) ⊗V(x3, · · · , [x4s−1, · · · , x4n−1),
H •(PSp(n), Z) ∼= Z[a2]/(2a2, a4s) ⊗V(x3, · · · , x4n−1),

(3)
with x4s−1 reducing mod 2 to a4s−1. Consider the commuting diagram of ﬁbrations

From (3), H 4(PSp(n)) vanishes if and only if s = 1, i.e., if and only if n is odd.
However, in the spectral sequence for the bottom row of (4), E4,0
2 = F2 a4. So
d4(x3) will be 0 if n is even and must equal a4 if n is odd. Comparing with the
spectral sequence for the top row of (4), we see that we get a diagram

for n even, whereas for n odd, the image under π∗ of H 3(PSp(n)) in H 3(Sp(n −
1)) ∼= H 3(Sp(n)) is of index two. This is consistent, incidentally, with what hap-
pened for Sp(1) = SU(2) and for PSp(1) = SO(3).

(3) Now consider the orthogonal and spinor groups. Here we proceed by induc-
tion on the dimension. Recall that Spin(4) is not simple and splits as a product
of two copies of SU(2), while Spin(3) = SU(2) was already dealt with above, so
we start the induction with Spin(5). This is the same as Sp(2) and SO(5) is the
same as PSp(2), so we’ve already handled this case. We could get the case of
Spin(6) by the induction below, but instructive to give a separate argument just

as a check. Indeed, Spin(6) = SU(4), and its cohomology is torsion-free, though
SO(6) is a double cover of PSU(4). But as in (4), we have a commutative diagram
of ﬁbrations

SU(3)

/ SU(4)

π

SU(3)

/ SO(6)

/ RP7.

(The action of SO(6) on RP7 is by dividing out the action of SU(4) on S7 by ±1.)
As before, we get a commuting diagram of Serre spectral sequences. Along the

vertical axis we have the cohomology ring of SU(3), which isV(x3, x5). Along the
horizontal axis we haveV(x7) in the case of SU(4) and H •(RP7), generated by a

torsion-free class x7 with x2
2 = 0, in the case
of SO(6). The spectral sequence for SU(4) collapses, while the one for SO(6) has
a potential diﬀerential d4 sending the generator x3 in E0,3
2. However, this
2
would kill oﬀ the torsion in H 4(SO(6)), and Borel proves in [10, Th´eor`eme 8.6]
that H •(SO(n)) has 2-torsion in degree 4 as long as n ≥ 5. So the diﬀerential d4
must vanish on x3 and we conclude that π∗ is an isomorphism via a diagram chase
as before.

7 = 0 and a 2-torsion class y2 with y4

to y2

Now we’re ready for the inductive step. Assume n ≥ 6 and we already know

π∗ : H 3(SO(n − 1)) → H 3(Spin(n − 1))

is an isomorphism, and consider the commutative diagram of ﬁbrations

Spin(n − 1)

Examination of the Serre spectral sequences shows that H 3 = E0,3
∞ , for both SO(n)
and Spin(n). By inductive hypothesis, π∗ is an isomorphism on E0,3
2 , and there is
no room for diﬀerentials aﬀecting the vertical axis until we get to H 4 (since the
non-zero columns are distance n − 1 ≥ 5 apart.) So E0,3
∞ in both spectral
sequences and we’re done.

2 = E0,3

To get the case of G = PSO(2n) with n odd, recall that we already did this
case when n = 3, since PSO(6) = PSU(4). However, by [43, Corollary 1.8], the
inclusion PSO(6) → PSO(2n) induces an isomorphism on cohomology in degree
≤ 3 for any n odd. Similarly for the inclusion Spin(6) → Spin(2n), by what we’ve
already done. So the case of PSO(2n) follows from the known case of PSO(6).

(4) To handle the case where G is the adjoint group of E6, since d = 3 in this

case, we need to study the cohomology of G and eG with F3 coeﬃcients. Fortunately

this is known. By [45] or by [31],

(One can also read oﬀ (5) and (6) from [46].) To understand what’s going on here,

the comments in [31] are useful. To a good degree of approximation, eG looks like

K(Z, 3), whose cohomology is known and agrees with (5) in low degree. Now G,
even though it is not simply connected, is a simple space and so has a Postnikov
tower, the bottom of which looks like a ﬁbration

K(Z, 3)

The k-invariant of (7) is identiﬁed with the diﬀerential d4 of the associated Serre
spectral sequence, taking the canonical class in H 3(K(Z, 3)) to the k-invariant
living in H 4(K(Z/3, 1)) = F3e2
2 6= 0 in
H 4(G, F3), the k-invariant must vanish, meaning that X ≃ K(Z, 3) × K(Z/3, 1).
Indeed, the low-dimensional cohomology of G indeed looks like that of K(Z, 3) ×

2, with notation consistent with (6). Since e2

K(Z/3, 1). So to compute π∗, we can replace eG by K(Z, 3) × E(Z/3) and G by

K(Z, 3) × B(Z/3) without changing the low-degree cohomology. Since H 3 lives on
the K(Z, 3) factor, we see that π∗ is the identity on cohomology with coeﬃcients
in F3 and thus on integral cohomology as well.

The case of the adjoint group G of E7 is handled similarly, even though the
eventual result is diﬀerent. This time π is a covering of degree 2 and so we have

to look at cohomology with coeﬃcients in F2. For eG this turns out to be ([40,

Proposition 5.1] or [31, Proposition 2.30]):

living in H 4(K(Z/2, 1)) = F2x4

this map must also coincide with the map π∗ : H 3(G, F2) → H 3(eG, F2) (since
K(Z, 3) is a good approximation to eG and X is a good approximation to G), so

we conclude that π∗ is not the identity on H 3 with coeﬃcients in F2, hence is not
an isomorphism on integral cohomology.

Remark 2. For G of types G2, F4, or E8, we automatically have d = 1 and there
is nothing to prove. So more work remains only in certain cases in type Dn (n
even). Just to ﬁll in a little more about the case of Dn (n even), we have the

Theorem 3. Let G = PSO(2n) with n even, n ≥ 4, and let π : eG = Spin(2n) → G
Then π∗ : H 3(G) → H 3(eG) kills the torsion and on the torsion-free part is an

isomorphism for n divisible by 4, multiplication by 2 for n ≡ 2 (mod 4).

Proof. Since we have already shown in Theorem 1(3) that the covering Spin(2n) →
SO(2n) induces an isomorphism on H 3, it suﬃces to study the behavior of the
covering map SO(2n) → PSO(2n) on the torsion-free part of H 3(PSO(2n)). For
this we use the ﬁbration

SO(2n − 1) → PSO(2n) → RP2n−1

together with Borel’s calculation of H •(PSO(2n), F2) in [10, Th´eor`eme 11.5]. In
low degrees, the E2 term for the Serre spectral sequence of (11) looks like Figure

H 3(G) is d4 : H 3(SO(2n − 1)) → H 4(RP2n−1). If this diﬀerential is 0, then the
torsion-free generator of H 3(G) will pull back to the generator of H 3(SO(2n − 1)),
and hence will also lift under π∗ to the generator of H 3(SO(2n)). However, if this
d4 is non-zero, then the map H 3(G) → H 3(SO(2n − 1)) will have image of index
2, and so π∗ will be multiplication by 2, as well. To ascertain whether or not d4 is
non-zero, we need only compare the rank of H 4(G) (which will be an elementary
abelian 2-group) with the rank of E2 in total degree 4, which is 3. If they are
equal, d4 must vanish; if they are unequal, d4 will be nontrivial.

By [10, Th´eor`eme 11.5],

H •(PSO(2n), F2) ∼= (F2(a)/(as)) ⊗ A, A = hx1, x2, · · · ,dxs−1, · · · , x2n−1i ,

where a is in degree 1, s ≥ 4 is the largest power of 2 dividing 2n, and in the algebra
A, x2
2 = x4, etc., and the monomials in the x’s with no xj repeated are a
basis for A over F2. If n ≡ 0 (mod 4), then s ≥ 8 and a4 6= 0, so we have three
independent classes in H 4(PSO(2n), F2) which are reductions of integral classes,
namely a4, a2x2 = (ax1)2, and x4 = x2
1. However, if n ≡ 2 (mod 4), then
s = 4 and a4 = 0, so there are only two independent classes in H 4(PSO(2n), F2)
which are reductions of integral classes, namely a2x2 = (ax1)2 and x4 = x2
2 = x4
1.
That concludes the proof.

2.2. T-dualities from Langlands duality. Now we return to the main subject
of Section 2, the connection between Langlands duality and T-duality. We make
no claims for originality here — we are just restating the results of [20] and [18]
in a form that will be convenient for later calculations. Let G be a connected
compact simple Lie group, and let T be a maximal torus in G. Associated to T
we have the weight lattice, the character group Hom(T, T) of T , which can also
be identiﬁed with H 1(T ), and the coweight lattice H1(T ), which can be identiﬁed
with the set of cocharacters Hom(T, T ). The weight lattice is also the set of
allowable weights for irreducible representations of G.
Inside the weight lattice
is the set of roots Φ(G, T ) (these are exactly the non-zero weights of the adjoint
representation), which span a sublattice, called the root lattice. The weight lattice
and the root lattice coincide exactly when G is an adjoint group. The triple
(H 1(T ), H1(T ), Φ(G, T )) determines G up to isomorphism. The Langlands dual G∨
of G is the connected compact simple Lie group obtained by interchanging H 1(T )
and H1(T ) and replacing the roots Φ(G, T ) by the coroots Φ(G, T )∨. Langlands
duality performed twice brings one back to the starting point, and the duality
interchanges simply connected groups and adjoint groups. The Langlands dual
G∨ is locally isomorphic to G if G is of type A, D, E, F, or G, while Langlands
duality interchanges types B and C. The group SO(2n) of type Dn is neither simply
connected nor an adjoint group, and is in fact self-dual. See [20, §2] for a very
clear explanation of all of this, as well as for additional references. The following
is the main theorem of [20] and [18] (though the case of type B2 = C2 is never
mentioned there explicitly).

10

VARGHESE MATHAI AND JONATHAN ROSENBERG

Theorem 4 (Daenzer-van Erp, Bunke-Nikolaus). Let G be a connected compact
simple Lie group of rank n with maximal torus T , and let G∨ be its Langlands dual.
Assume G is not of type Bn or Cn with n ≥ 3; this guarantees that G and G∨ are
locally isomorphic (i.e., have isomorphic Lie algebras). Then there are canonical
choices h ∈ H 3(G) and h∨ ∈ H 3(G∨) for which (G, h) and (G∨, h∨) are T-dual as
principal Tn-bundles over the ﬂag manifold G/T , in a sense which we will make
precise below.

Remark 5. Theorem 4 actually requires some further interpretation, because the
term “T-duality” has various meanings in the literature. For example the deﬁnition
used in [20] is much weaker than the one used in [18], which comes from [19]. One
could also work just as well with the deﬁnition in [51]. However, the deﬁnition
used in [20] is not strong enough for getting the results on twisted K-theory which
are our main interest here. Just to ﬁx terminology for what follows, we can phrase
the deﬁnition of T-duality as follows. A set of T-duality data over a a space X
begins with a pair (E, h) consisting of a principal Tn-bundle p : E → X and a
class h ∈ H 3(E). However, this by itself is not enough for a (classical) T-dual to
be deﬁned; one needs two additional things. First, the class h must pull back to 0
on each torus ﬁber. In the case where E = G is a connected compact simple Lie
group and X = G/T , this condition is automatic [18, Corollary 8.3].4 Then to get

a well-deﬁned T-dual, one needs a choice of a lifting X → eR of the classifying map
X → R of the pair (E, h) over X. The classifying spaces R and eR are discussed
in [51, §5]. The space eR is a two-stage Postnikov system

K(Z, 3)

(12)

/ eR

K(Zn, 2) × K(Zn, 2),

with k-invariant x1 y1 + · · ·+ xn yn (where xj and yj are the canonical classes in H 2
of the ﬁrst and second K(Zn, 2) factors, respectively), and R is a more complicated

space that has eR as its universal covering. In (12), the bundle projection projected

into the ﬁrst factor corresponds to the characteristic class c(p) of the torus bundle
p
E
−→ X, while the bundle projection projected into the second factor corresponds
(when dim T = 1 — this case is easier to explain) to the push-forward of the class
h under the Gysin map p! : H 3(E) → H 2(X). T-duality interchanges these. In
our situation, X = G/T will be simply connected, so existence of a lift from R to

eR is automatic, but we will see that there is a canonical lift.

4For another proof, note that it suﬃces to check this for cohomology with coeﬃcients in R.
But H 3(G, R) ∼= H 3
deR(G, R) is generated by the 3-form (X, Y, Z) 7→ hX, [Y, Z]i, X, Y, Z ∈ g (the
Lie algebra) and h , i the Killing form. Since the bracket vanishes on the Lie algebra of T , this
form restricts to 0 in H 3

deR(T, R).

Finally, there is one additional complication. In the case of Langlands duality,
G and G∨ are really torus bundles over two diﬀerent spaces, G/T and G∨/T ∨. If
G is of type B or C with rank n ≥ 3, then these spaces are not even homotopy
equivalent, although they are homotopy equivalent after inverting 2 [36]. However
in all cases except these, there is a diﬀeomorphism G/T → G∨/T ∨ coming from
an isomorphism of root systems Φ → Φ∨. (This diﬀeomorphism can be taken to
be the identity in types A, D, and E, but it can’t be the identity in types B2 = C2,
G2, or F4, since long roots have short coroots and vice versa.)

To ﬁnish making Theorem 4 precise, we need to make explicit the choice of h
and the choice of the lift X → R of the classifying map of (G, h) over X = G/T .
The following is a slight reformulation of the recipe given in [18, Theorem 8.5].

with only even-dimensional cells, indexed by elements of the Weyl group W =
NG(T )/T . Thus the cohomology of G/T is torsion-free and concentrated in even

Theorem 6 (Bunke-Nikolaus). Let G, T be as in Theorem 4, and let π : eG → G
be the universal cover of G, eT the inverse image of T in eG (a maximal torus in
eG). Let (G∨, T ∨) be the Langlands dual of (G, T ) and let π∨ : fG∨ → G∨ be its
universal cover, fT ∨ the inverse image of T ∨ in fG∨. Then Theorem 4 holds for
the following explicit choice of h and a lift. Recall that eG is 2-connected and that
G/T ∼= eG/eT is a complex projective algebraic variety with a cell decomposition
degrees, and the sum of the Betti numbers is |W |, while eG has no cohomology
in degrees 1 and 2 and H 3(eG) ∼= Z. The group G in general has torsion in its
for the ﬁbration eT → eG → eG/eT = G/T , the diﬀerential d2 gives a transgression
isomorphism ψ : H 1(eT )
with V2(H 1(T )), and similarly H 2(eT ) with V2(H 1(eT )), the diﬀerential d2 sends
H 2(T ), respectively H 2(eT ), to H 2(G/T ) ⊗ H 1(T ) (resp., H 2(G/T ) ⊗ H 1(eT )) via

∼=−→ H 2(G/T ). (Restricted to H 1(T ), its image has ﬁnite
index, with the quotient identiﬁed to H 2(G) ∼= π1(G), or more precisely its dual
group, via the universal coeﬃcient theorem.) Since H 2(T ) is naturally identiﬁed

cohomology in degree 2 but also has H 3(G) ∼= Z. (The relationship between H 3(G)
and H 3(G) was discussed above in Section 2.1.5) In the Serre spectral sequence

a ∧ b 7→ ψ(a) ⊗ b − ψ(b) ⊗ a.

The principal T -bundle p : G → G/T has a classifying map G/T → BT , deter-
mined up to homotopy by the induced map on cohomology H 2(BT ) → H 2(G/T ) 6,
and since H 2(BT ) is canonically isomorphic to H 1(T ), we can think of this as a
characteristic class c(p) ∈ Hom(H 1(T ), H 2(G/T )). (We use the letter c since this

is precisely the Chern class when n = 1.) Fix an isomorphism fG∨ → eG (possi-

ble since we are excluding types B and C with n ≥ 3) and let φ : H 2(G∨/T ∨) →

5As explained there, a slight adjustment is needed in case Dn for n even when G = PSO(2n),

since in this case H 3(G) ∼= Z ⊕ Z/2. The torsion summand is harmless here.

6This is because BT is a K(Zn, 2) space.

and φ ◦ c(p∨) = φ ◦ ψ∨ ◦ (π∨)∗ : H 1(T ∨) → H 2(G/T ). Let h ∈ H 3(G) be the image

in E2,1
in Hom(H1(T ), H 2(G/T )) ∼= H 2(G/T ) ⊗ H 1(T ), which makes sense since this el-
ement is easily seen to be killed by d2. Similarly for h∨ ∈ H 3(G∨). Then (G, h)

(the dashed arrow is a homotopy push-out) is a set of T-duality data, and the dual
data corresponds to (G∨, h∨) viewed also as a bundle over G/T via φ.

Proof. The one thing to check is that φ ◦ c(p∨) is killed by d2 and thus gives a
genuine class in H 3(G). This involves showing that the map is W -invariant. But
S2(H 1(T ) ⊗Z Q) contains a unique W -invariant element up to scale, namely the

multiple of this form, which is immediate from the formula.

Killing form, so we just need to check that ψ−1 ◦ φ ◦ c(p∨) : H1(T ) → H 1(eT ) is a

As explained in [18], it is then almost a tautology that the T-dual of this data is
the data for (G∨, h∨), since G and G∨ play completely symmetrical roles here. (cid:3)

Corollary 7. In the setting of Theorems 4 and 6, one gets an isomorphism of
twisted K-groups

K •(G, h) ∼= K •+n(G∨, h∨).

Proof. This follows immediately from [19] or [51], applied to the T-duality.

(cid:3)

2.3. Twisted K-theory for Langlands dual pairs. The results of Section 2.2,
especially Corollary 7, provide new examples of isomorphisms between twisted
K-groups on diﬀerent compact simple Lie groups. This provides additional moti-
vation for understanding the computation of such twisted K-groups and computing
exactly what one gets in the case of the T-duality pairs coming from Langlands
duality. We start with a few very explicit examples.

Example 8 (SU(2) and SO(3)). We begin with the simplest case of G = SU(2),
G∨ = SO(3), the only dual pair in rank 1 (though this pair has other aliases,
e.g., G = Sp(1) and G∨ = PSp(1), or G = Spin(3) and G∨ = SO(3)). In this
case G/T = S2, G is topologically S3, p is the Hopf bundle S3 → S2, and G∨ is
topologically RP3. It is easy to see that the Chern class c(p) = 1 (for the usual
identiﬁcation of H 2(S2) with Z) and c(p∨) = 2. Since T-duality for circle bundles
(see for example [13, 50, 60]) requires p!(h) = c(p∨) and (p∨)! = c(p), we easily
compute from the Gysin sequences that h = 2 and h∨ = 1, again for the usual
identiﬁcations of the H 3 groups with Z.

Let us now check Corollary 7 in this example. We can compute the twisted K-
theory via the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS) for twisted K-theory,
ﬁrst discussed in [58, 59] and further explained in [4, 5]. Since G and G∨ are
3-dimensional, the only diﬀerential is d3, and Sq3 = 0 for both G and G∨. So
(for any choice of h and h∨), the twisted K-groups are computed from the spectral
sequence shown in Figure 2. (By Bott periodicity, the diﬀerentials repeat vertically
with period 2.)

SO(3) (right). The symbol • denotes a copy of Z; × denotes a
copy of Z/2.

From the ﬁgure, it is apparent that (assuming h and h∨ are both non-zero) we get
K •(G, h) = Z/h in odd degree, 0 in even degree. Similarly, we get K •(G∨, h∨) =
Z/h∨ in odd degree, Z/2 in even degree. (This calculation also appears in [15,
§3.2].) So with the choice h = 2 and h∨ = 1, we get Z/2 in odd degree for G, Z/2
in even degree for G∨, as is consistent with Corollary 7. Note, incidentally, that
no other positive choices for h and h∨ would work here.
(cid:3)

Example 9 (SU(3) and PSU(3)). Now consider the case of the Langlands dual
pair G = SU(3) and G∨ = PSU(3). We want to compute the appropriate values
of h and h∨ for this case. Recall from Theorem 1 that if π : G → G∨ is the 3-to-1
covering map, then π∗ : H 3(G∨) → H 3(G) is an isomorphism in this case.

Since G and G∨ are bundles over G/T , we need the cohomology of the ﬂag

variety G/T . This is a classical calculation of Borel [9, Proposition 29.2]:

H •(G/T ) ∼= S •(H 1(T ))/S •(H 1(T ))W ,

Here x1, x2, and x3 represent a basis for the weight lattice of the maximal torus
of U(3): xj(diag(z1, z2, z3)) = zj, and the Weyl group invariants are generated by
the elementary symmetric functions. Imposing the relation x1 + x2 + x3 = 0 is
equivalent to restricting to SU(3). Inside the weight lattice H 1(T ) = Zx1 + Zx2
we have the root lattice H 1(T ∨), spanned by the simple roots α = x1 − x2 and
x2 − x3 = x1 + 2x2 = α + 3x2. So the index of H 1(T ∨) in H 1(T ) is

as it should be (since 3 is the degree of the covering G → G∨).

We would now like to compute h and h∨ explicitly, as multiples of the generators
of H 3(G) and H 3(G∨). For this we can split the torus bundles G → G/T and
G∨ → G/T into circle bundles and use [51, Theorem 5.6]. There are many ways
to do this, corresponding to diﬀerent choices of basis in the weight lattice H 1(T ),
but it is convenient to split the bundles as shown:

It remains to compute the twisted K-theory for (G, h) and for (G∨, h∨) and to
check the result of Corollary 7. For G this is easy — either we can appeal to [14]

or [23], or else we can compute directly from the AHSS, since H ∗(G) =V(x3, x5)

and h = x3, Sq3 xj = 0, so that d3 is multiplication by x3, which sends x3 to 0 and
x5 to x3x5. So ker d3 = Zx3 + Zx3x5 = image d3 and E4 = 0. Thus K •(G, h) = 0
(in both even and odd degree). In the case of G∨, the cohomology is a bit more
complicated because (via (1)) there is also a 3-torsion generator y in degree 2 with
y2 6= 0, y3 = 0. The 5-dimensional torsion-free generator x5 reduces mod 3 to
x1y2. Rationally, things are just as for G, so it suﬃces to see what happens mod
3. The class h∨ mod 3 is x3, in the notation of (1). A basis for H •(G∨, F3) is given
by 1, x1, y, x1y, x3, y2, x1x3, x3y, x1y2, x1x3y, x3y2, and x1x3y2. Multiplication
by x3 kills the 6 of these monomials containing an x3 factor, and sends the other 6
monomials to these 6. So once again we see that ker d3 = image d3 and the twisted
K-theory K •(G∨, h∨) = 0 (in both even and odd degree). This is consistent with
Corollary 7.

Example 10 (Sp(2) = Spin(5) and PSp(2) = SO(5)). We can do a similar cal-
culation for the Langlands dual pair G = Sp(2) and G∨ = PSp(2), and compute
the appropriate values of h and h∨ for this case. Recall from Theorem 1 that if
π : G → G∨ is the 2-to-1 covering map, then π∗ : H 3(G∨) → H 3(G) is an isomor-
phism in this case.

We can take the weight lattice H 1(T ) to be Zx1 ⊕ Zx2, with the root lattice
H 1(T ∨) spanned by the simple roots x1 − x2 and 2x2. The Weyl group W is the
dihedral group of order 8 generated by the reﬂection x1 7→ x1, x2 7→ −x2 and by
the rotation x1 7→ x2, x2 7→ −x1. The ring of W -invariants in Z[x1, x2] is generated
by x2

degree 2 in the cohomology ring.

As in the last example, one can check that the twisted K-theory vanishes on
both sides of the duality. (A quick way of proving this will be given in the following
Section 2.4.)

The phenomena that showed up in Examples 8, 9, and 10 can all be explained
by the following theorem, which also explains why we were interested in Theorem
1.

Theorem 11. Let G be a compact simply connected simple Lie group, not of type
Bn or Cn with n ≥ 3, so that G∨, the corresponding Langlands dual, is of adjoint
type, and there is a covering map π : G → G∨. Then for the Langlands dual pair
G and G∨, with h and h∨ the classes of Theorem 6, h∨ is the generator of H 3(G∨)
speciﬁed by the usual orientation of an embedded rank-1 subgroup, i.e., it is 1 when
we identify H 3(G∨) with Z, and h = π∗(h∨) as computed in Theorems 1 and 3.7
Furthermore, the twisted K-theory groups K •(G, h) and K •(G∨, h∨) vanish unless
G = SU(2) and G∨ = SO(3).

Proof. The key here is to observe that the bundle p : G → G/T and the bundle
p∨ : G∨ → G∨/T ∨ are related by the covering map π : G → G∨. Thus if E is the
Poincar´e bundle (the pull-back of p and p∨), we have a commuting diagram

.

First, look at the classes h and h∨. They both pull back to the same thing in
H 3(E), so

(p∗(p∨))∗h = ((p∨)∗(p))∗(h∨).

By commutativity of (15), (p∨)∗(p) = π ◦ p∗(p∨), so that means that

(p∗(p∨))∗ (h − π∗h∨) = 0,
or h − π∗h∨ = 0 modulo the kernel of (p∗(p∨))∗. But

c(p∗(p∨)) = p∗(c(p∨)) = p∗(c(p) ◦ π).

7In the exceptional case where G is of type Dn with n ≡ 0 (mod 4), h∨ is still the generator

of an inﬁnite cyclic summand in H 3(G∨).

However, from the Serre spectral sequence of the T -bundle p, p∗ kills the image
of c(p) : H 1(T ) → H 2(G/T ). So the Chern class of p∗(p∨) vanishes, i.e., this is
a trivial bundle, and hence the pull-back map on cohomology is faithful. Hence
h = π∗(h∨).

Next, we show that h∨ has to be primitive, i.e., has to be ±1 as a multiple of
the generator of H 3(G∨). (The multiple is positive because of the normalization in
Theorem 6, so it’s therefore exactly 1.) This follows from the simple connectivity
Indeed, suppose h∨ = kα with
of G together with the following Lemma 12.
α ∈ H 3(G∨), k > 1. Then by Lemma 12, the classifying map for the T-duality

data for (G∨ → G/T, h∨) factors as fk ◦ (something) : G/T → eR, and so by the

Lemma the classifying map c(p) : G/T → BT for the T-dual is divisible by k. But
this would imply that G has a k-fold covering, contradicting the assumption that
G is 1-connected.

Finally, putting what we have done so far together with Theorems 1 and 3, we
see that h = 1 or 2. By the results of [14, 23], that implies that K •(G, h) = 0
unless G = SU(2). (In all other cases, we get a direct sum of copies of Z/h′, where
h′ =
gcd(h,m) and m is divisible by 2, so that h′ = 1.) By Corollary 7, we also get
K •(G∨, h∨) = 0.

h

for T-duality data for Tn-bundles over simply connected spaces, as deﬁned in [51];

Lemma 12. Let k > 1 be a positive integer and let eR be the classifying space
recall that this is a ﬁbration as diagrammed in (12). Then, up to homotopy, eR has
a unique endomorphism fk which induces multiplication by k on π3(eR) ∼= Z and
which on π2(eR) ∼= Zn × Zn is the identity on the ﬁrst factor and multiplication by

p
k on the second factor. The eﬀect of fk on T-duality data (E
−→ Z, h) is to keep
the bundle p the same and to multiply the H-ﬂux h by k. On the T-dual data, fk
multiplies the characteristic class c(p∨) by k.

Proof. This is a simple exercise in obstruction theory, based on the observation
that the given maps on homotopy groups are compatible with the k-invariant of
the bundle (12).
(cid:3)

Theorem 11 in a sense is disappointing, in that we get no nontrivial isomorphisms
of twisted K-groups, but it completely settles the nature of the T-dualities coming
from Langlands duality.

2.4. Twisted K-theory of compact simple Lie groups. We now move on to
the question of how to compute the twisted K-groups K ∗(G, h) more generally,
where G is a connected compact simple Lie group and h ∈ H 3(G) ∼= Z. (Strictly
speaking, a twist for K-theory is not exactly the same as a class in H 3, but the
diﬀerence won’t matter for our purposes since we just want to compute the groups
as abstract groups.) Methods for computing K ∗(G, h) were discussed in [48, 53]
in a few cases, and the calculation for simply connected G was done completely

18

VARGHESE MATHAI AND JONATHAN ROSENBERG

in [14, 23]. However, the methods used there do not work when G is not simply
connected, at least not without a lot of additional work, so other techniques are
needed. We illustrate another method using the Segal spectral sequence (from [61,
Proposition 5.2]). We begin with an abstract result, which could be made even
more general, though the case given is suﬃcient for our purposes
Theorem 13. Let F ι−→ E → B be a ﬁber bundle, say of compact metrizable spaces
with ﬁnite homotopy type, and let h ∈ H 3(E). Then there is a spectral sequence
H p(B, K q(F, ι∗h)) ⇒ K •(E, h).

Proof. In the absence of the twist, this is precisely the spectral sequence of [61,
Proposition 5.2] in the case where the cohomology theory used is complex K-
theory, and if E = B and F = pt, it reduces to the usual AHSS. Similarly, if
E = B and F = pt, but h 6= 0, this is the AHSS for twisted K-theory. To get
the general case, we can assume (by homotopy invariance) that B is a ﬁnite CW-
complex, and ﬁlter B by its skeleta. This induces a ﬁltration of K •(E, h) for which
this is the induced spectral sequence (by Segal’s proof).

There is also another way to see this in terms of continuous-trace algebras.
K •(E, h) is the K-theory of a continuous-trace C ∗-algebra A with spectrum B
and Dixmier-Douady class h. Using the bundle projection, we can write A as
the algebra of sections of a bundle of C ∗-algebras over B, where the ﬁber algebra
∼= F and the
over a point b ∈ B is a continuous-trace algebra with spectrum Eb
Dixmier-Douady class is the pull-back of h to this ﬁber. Projections in the ﬁber
algebras locally extend to a neighborhood of the ﬁber, and the diﬀerentials of the
spectral sequence measure the obstructions to extending them over the inverse
images of bigger and bigger skeleta of B.
(cid:3)

Next let us try to explain the somewhat puzzling results of [14] and [23], which,
to pick just the simplest case, say that K •(SU(n + 1), h) is isomorphic to Z/h′
tensored with an exterior algebra on n − 1 generators, where

(16)

h′ =

h

gcd(h, lcm(1, 2, · · · , n))

.

The method of proof of this result was quite indirect — [14] used the Hodgkin
K¨unneth spectral sequence in equivariant K-theory together with the calculations
of Freed-Hopkins-Teleman [27, 28]8, while [23] used a Rothenberg-Steenrod spectral
sequence and K-theory of loop spaces.

Theorem 13 suggests a potentially much simpler method for doing the calcu-
lations inductively, which we will consider here for SU(n + 1) and PSU(n + 1),
though it could be extended to other classical groups as well. Let G = PSU(n + 1)

and eG = SU(n + 1). The transitive action of eG = SU(n + 1) on the unit sphere

S2n+1 in Cn+1 descends to a transitive action of G on L2n+1(n + 1), the lens space

8There is indirect physics input here since Freed-Hopkins-Teleman showed that the equivariant

twisted K-theory is the same as the Verlinde ring of the associated WZW model.

obtained by dividing S2n+1 by the action of µn+1, the (n + 1)-th roots of unity.
We thus get a commuting diagram of ﬁbrations

H p(L2n+1(n + 1), H q(SU(n)))

H p+q(PSU(n + 1)).

Here H •(SU(n)) is an exterior algebra on generators x3, x5, · · · , x2n−1 (with the
subscript indicating the degree), so the ﬁrst sequence collapses just for dimensional
reasons. The second sequence looks as if it could have a nontrivial diﬀerential
d4 : x3 7→ cy2, where y ∈ H 2(L2n+1(n + 1)) ∼= Z/(n + 1) is the usual generator.
However, the calculations of H •(PSU(n + 1), Fp) by Borel in [10, Th´eor`eme 11.4]
and by Baum and Browder in [6] (which already appeared in the proof of Theorem
1) show that in many cases (e.g., n + 1 odd), d4(x3) = 0 in the spectral sequence
for the lower ﬁbration in (17). Then the restriction maps H 3(G) → H 3(SU(n))

and H 3(eG) → H 3(SU(n)) are both isomorphisms.

Now apply Theorem 13 to the ﬁbrations of (17). We get spectral sequences

H p(S2n+1, K q(SU(n), h)) ⇒ K p+q(SU(n + 1), h)

and (say when n+1 is odd, so we can still identify H 3(PSU(n+1)) with H 3(SU(n)))

H p(L2n+1(n + 1), K q(SU(n), h)) ⇒ K p+q(PSU(n + 1), h).

Assuming we’ve inductively proved (16) for smaller values of n, this now gives
information about K •(SU(n+1), h)) or K •(PSU(n+1), h)). We will show how this
can be used to get information about these with relatively elementary methods,
not involving the techniques used by Braun and Douglas.

For example, while the following is weaker than the results of [53, 48] (for SU(3))
and of [14, 23] (for SU(n + 1) in general), it does give some highly nontrivial
information, and the proof is relatively elementary.
Theorem 14. Suppose h ∈ Z ∼= H 3(SU(n + 1)) is relatively prime to n!. Then
K •(SU(n + 1), h) is Z/h tensored with an exterior algebra on n − 1 odd generators.

Proof. We proceed by induction on n. The case n = 1 is covered by Example
8, where we computed that K •(SU(2), h) ∼= Z/h in odd degree. So assume that
n > 1 and that the result holds for smaller values of n, and use the Segal spectral
sequence (Theorem 13) associated to the ﬁbration

SU(n) → SU(n + 1) → S2n+1.

(18)
Since n > 1, it is clear from the ﬁbration that the restriction map H 3(SU(n+1)) →
H 3(SU(n)) is an isomorphism. Also, if h is relatively prime to n!, then it is certainly
relatively prime to (n − 1)!. So we get a Segal spectral sequence
H p(S2n+1, K q(SU(n), h)) ⇒ K p+q(SU(n + 1), h),

and by inductive hypothesis, K q(SU(n), h) ∼= (Z/h) ⊗V(y1, · · · , yn−2), with the

Z/h and the y’s all in odd degree. We just need to show that the spectral sequence
collapses. There is only one possible diﬀerential, d2n+1, related to the homotopical
nontriviality of the ﬁbration. However, the long exact homotopy sequence of the
ﬁbration includes the following:

π2n+1(SU(n + 1)) → π2n+1(S2n+1) → π2n(SU(n)) → π2n(SU(n + 1)).

(19)
By [11, §8, Theorem 5], π2n+1(SU(n+1)) ∼= Z, π2n(SU(n+1)) = 0, and π2n(SU(n)) ∼=
Z/n!. So substituting back into (19) we get

· · · → Z → Z → Z/n! → 0.

That means that after inverting n! (but not without doing this), the map

π2n+1(SU(n + 1)) → π2n+1(S2n+1)

splits, i.e., the ﬁbration (18) splits. (A splitting of the generator of π2n+1(S2n+1)
would be a map S2n+1 → SU(n + 1) splitting the ﬁbration.) Or equivalently, the
class of the bundle (18) is given by a class in

[S2n+1, B SU(n)] = π2n+1(B SU(n)) ∼= π2n(SU(n)) ∼= Z/n!.

So when gcd(h, n!) = 1, d2n+1 vanishes and the conclusion follows.

(cid:3)

Remark 15. Note that Theorem 14, and especially the appeal to Bott’s theorem
[11, §8, Theorem 5], “explains” the strange denominator in formula (16), at least
to some extent. We can also handle the symplectic groups the same way.
Theorem 16. Suppose h ∈ Z ∼= H 3(Sp(n)) is relatively prime to (2n + 1)!. Then
K •(Sp(n), h)) is Z/h tensored with an exterior algebra on n − 1 odd generators.

Proof. This proceeds exactly the same way as Theorem 14, using the homotopy
sequence of the ﬁbration

Sp(n − 1) → Sp(n) → S4n−1.

By Bott periodicity and stability, π4n−1(Sp(n)) ∼= Z and π4n−2(Sp(n)) = 0. The
group π4n−2(Sp(n − 1)) is not in the stable range since 4n − 2 = 4(n − 1) + 2, but
it is computed in [37] and [52], and turns out to be Z/(2n + 1)! or Z/(2(2n + 1)!),

GROUP DUALITIES, T-DUALITIES, AND TWISTED K-THEORY

21

depending on whether n is odd or even. Thus we get the long exact homotopy
sequence

(Z ∼= π4n−1(Sp(n))) → π4n−1(S4n−1) → (Z/(2n + 1)! or Z/(2(2n + 1)!)) → 0,

and so the ﬁbration splits after inverting primes ≤ 2n + 1. The rest of the proof
is as before.
(cid:3)

Results for other groups can be proved with similar methods. For example, we

have:
Theorem 17. Suppose h ∈ Z ∼= H 3(G2) is relatively prime to 2, 3, and 5. Then
K •(G2, h) is Z/h in both even and odd degree.

Proof. This proceeds similarly, using the homotopy sequence of the ﬁbration [10,
Lemme 17.1]

SU(2) → G2 → V7,2.

The Stiefel manifold V7,2 is 11-dimensional and has only one nontrivial homology
group below the top dimension, namely a Z/2 in dimension 5. The restriction
map H 3(G2) → H 3(SU(2)) is an isomorphism, so we can apply the Segal spectral
sequence and we get a spectral sequence

Ep,q

2 = H p(V7,2, K q(SU(2), h)) ⇒ K •(G2, h).

Here K q(SU(2), h) ∼= Z/h for q odd and is 0 for q even. If h is odd, Ep,q
is non-zero
2
only for p = 11 and q odd, and d11 is the only possible diﬀerential. However, we
have the long exact homotopy sequence

π11(G2) → π11(V7,2) → π10(SU(2)) → π10(G2),

and since π10(SU(2)) ∼= Z/15, the map π11(G2) → π11(V7,2) is surjective after
inverting 3 and 5. Furthermore, after inverting 2, V7,2 becomes homotopy equiva-
lent to S11 by the Hurewicz Theorem modulo the Serre class of 2-primary torsion
groups. So when h is prime to 2, 3, and 5, the spectral sequence is just as for
S3 × S11, must collapse, and gives the result.
(cid:3)

Similar techniques can also be used to compute twisted K-theory in some cases

for non-simply connected groups. Here is a representative example:

Theorem 18. Let h ∈ Z, identiﬁed with H 3(PSU(3)). Then if gcd(h, 3) = 1,

K •(PSU(3), h) ∼= K •(SU(3), h) ∼=(Z/h ⊗V(x1),

On the other hand, if h = 3, then both K even(PSU(3), h) and K odd(PSU(3), h) are
ﬁnite groups of order 27.

h odd,

Z/(h/2) ⊗V(x1), h even.

22

VARGHESE MATHAI AND JONATHAN ROSENBERG

Proof. Since we’ve seen that the restriction map H 3(PSU(3)) → H 3(SU(2)) (com-
ing from (17)) is an isomorphism, we get from (17) a Segal spectral sequence

(20)

H p(L5(3), K q(SU(2), h)) ⇒ K p+q(PSU(3), h).

Here we know that K q(SU(2), h) is Z/h, concentrated in odd degree. There are
now various cases. If h is prime to 3, then the lens space L5(3) looks like S5 mod
h, and the spectral sequence becomes the same as for K •(SU(3), h), for which we
know the answer by [53, 48, 14, 23].

So consider the case where h = 3. In this case, H •(L5(3), F3) ∼= F3[x1, y2]/(x2

1, y3
2)
with βx1 = y2. So the E2 stage of (20) gives groups of order 27 in both even and
odd degree. So it will suﬃce to show that the spectral sequence collapses at E2.
Since Ep,q
is only non-zero for q odd and for p ≤ 5, the only possible diﬀerentials
2
are d3 and d5. We consider them one at at time. Both diﬀerentials would vanish
if PSU(3) looked like S3 × L5(3), and have to do with nontriviality of the ﬁbra-
tion in (17). So how nontrivial is it? The homotopy groups of PSU(3) are given
by πj(PSU(3)) ∼= Z/3, j = 1; 0, j = 2; Z, j = 3; 0, j = 4; and Z, j = 5. Since
PSU(3) is a topological group, it is certainly simple and has a Postnikov system
even though it isn’t simply connected. The ﬁrst nontrivial stage of this Postnikov
system is a ﬁbration K(Z, 3) → X1 → K(Z/3, 1). The next stage is a ﬁbration
K(Z, 5) → X2 → X1. The k-invariant of X1 lies in H 4(K(Z/3, 1)) ∼= Z/3, and cor-
responds to the transgression d4 : H 3(K(Z, 3)) → H 4(K(Z/3, 1)) in the Serre spec-
tral sequence for the ﬁbration deﬁning X1. But H •(K(Z, 3), F3) ∼= F3[x1, y2]/(x2
1)
with βx1 = y2, which agrees with the cohomology of L5(3) up to degree 5, while by
2 is nonzero in H 4(PSU(3), F3). Thus d4 has to
(1), the element corresponding to y2
vanish and X1 ≃ K(Z, 3) × K(Z/3, 1). This means PSU(3) closely approximates
K(Z, 3) × K(Z/3, 1) through dimension 4. Hence as far as d3 in the Segal spectral
sequence is concerned, we might as well have PSU(3) ≃ S3 × L5(3), which causes
d3 to vanish. Vanishing of d5 then comes from comparison of spectral sequences;
the diagram (17) plus the fact that there are no diﬀerentials before d5 implies that
d5 for K •(PSU(3), h) must agree with d5 for K •(SU(3), h), which we know must
vanish if h is odd. So the result follows.
(cid:3)

Remark 19. Note that even when the Segal spectral sequence degenerates, there
is still an extension problem in going from E∞ to the actual twisted K-groups. In
the situation of Theorem 18, one can solve the extension problem by noting that
the method of proof really showed something stronger, namely that

K •(PSU(3), 3) ∼= K •(SU(2) × L5(3), 3) ∼= K •+1(L5(3), F3).

This turns out to be elementary abelian, for two reasons. First, the universal
coeﬃcient theorem for K-theory with Fp coeﬃcients splits, unlike what happens
for KO-theory with F2 coeﬃcients. (See [2, §2] for an explanation.) And secondly,

the complex K-theory eK 0(L5(3)) turns out to be elementary abelian, unlike what

GROUP DUALITIES, T-DUALITIES, AND TWISTED K-THEORY

23

happens for certain other lens spaces. For an explanation of this, see [41] and
especially the Mathematical Reviews review of this paper by Hirzebruch.

The ﬁnal result that the twisted K-groups in both even and odd degree are
(Z/3)3 was obtained previously in [32, (2.20)] from the physics perspective of D-
brane charges in WZW theories for PSU(3). More complicated calculations for
PSU(9), where the result is not so simple, appear in [33].

Note that exactly the same method proves:

Theorem 20. Let G = PSU(n + 1) or PSp(n), n ≥ 2, with universal cover

eG = SU(n + 1) or Sp(n). Suppose gcd(h, n + 1) = 1 (in the case of PSU(n + 1))
or h is odd (in the case of PSp(n)). Then π∗ : K •(G, h) → K •(eG, π∗h) is an

isomorphism of twisted K-theory groups.

Proof. We indicate the details for PSp(n); the other case is analogous. Consider the
commuting diagram of ﬁbrations (4), which gives a morphism of spectral sequences

H p(RP4n−1, K q(Sp(n − 1), ι∗h))

K p+q(PSp(n), h)

π∗

π∗

H p(S4n−1, K q(Sp(n − 1), ι∗π∗h))

3 K p+q(Sp(n), π∗h),

with ι∗ the pull-back to the ﬁber. Note that by Theorem 1, π∗h = h or 2h. But
in either event, by the results of [14, 23], since h is odd, K •(Sp(n − 1), π∗h) is

Z/h′ ⊗V(x1, · · · xn−2), with xj of odd degree, and with h′ odd. (Furthermore, the

value of h′ is independent of whether or not h is multiplied by 2.) So

π∗ : H p(RP4n−1, K q(Sp(n − 1), ι∗h)) → H p(S4n−1, K q(Sp(n − 1), ι∗π∗h))

is an isomorphism for all p and q. The result now follows by the comparison
theorem for spectral sequences. In the case of PSU(n + 1), we use the diagram
(17); note that π∗ = 1 if n is even and is 2 if n is odd. But in that case h,
being relatively prime to n + 1, is odd. In all cases, the order of the torsion in
K •(SU(n), ι∗h) is prime to the order of the torsion in the cohomology of the lens
space L2n+1 = S2n+1/µn+1. So everything works the same way.
(cid:3)

2.5. Level-rank dualities. To conclude this section, we ﬁnally mention level-
rank dualities, which are certain mysterious relations between WZW theories that
involve swapping a parameter for the group with one for the Virasoro level. (See,
e.g., [55, 54, 29, 30, 56, 57].) This is quite a deep subject and does seem to be
connected with twisted K-theory calculations, though not in a totally straightfor-
ward way. In [14, §6] Braun calls this “level-rank nonduality,” but this seems to
be too harsh, as even in Braun’s “nonduality” examples such as B2 at level 1 and
E8 at level 2 (with only a few exceptions, such as G2 at level 1 [14, §4], where
the twisted K-theory vanishes), the order of the torsion in the associated twisted

K-groups is the same, as it is this order that gives the dimension of the associated
fusion rings, which are equal for the dual theories.

A few examples will illustrate this point. The most basic case of level-rank
dualities is between WZW theories on SU(n) at level k and SU(k) at level n [54].
(This has evolved into the “strange duality” conjecture proved in [49, 7, 8].) While
these theories might at ﬁrst seem to have nothing to do with one another, there
is one immediate connection. The associated twisting class in both cases is n + k
(level plus dual Coxeter number), and if this is relatively prime to both (n − 1)!
and (k −1)! (for example, in the case of SU(3)4 and SU(4)3), it follows immediately
from Theorem 14 that the order of the torsion in the two twisted K-groups is the
same. Thus we have a very quick way of verifying this in certain cases. In some
cases the duality descends to the adjoint group (cf. [29, (9.3)]); the order of the
torsion is also the same for PSU(3)4 and PSU(4)3, since the twisting is by 3+4 = 7
in both cases and we can apply Theorem 20.

3. Orientifold dualities for Lie groups with involution

This section of the paper was motivated by the observation (see for example
[34, 21, 22]) that there are interesting examples of T-dualities between orientifold
string theories on Calabi-Yau manifolds with holomorphic and anti-holomorphic
involutions (in types IIB and IIA, respectively). Such dualities of orientifold theo-
ries are expected to result in isomorphisms of (possibly twisted) KR-groups, with
a degree shift that depends on the number of circles in which on dualizes. If we
interpret the term “Calabi-Yau manifold” in the broadest sense, as a complex
manifold, not necessarily compact or simply connected, with vanishing ﬁrst Chern
class, then complex Lie groups provide plenty of examples, since their holomor-
phic tangent bundles are parallelizable (and thus certainly have vanishing Chern
classes). Furthermore, semi-simple Lie groups are the natural setting for WZW
models in string theory and conformal ﬁeld theory, so they provide an obvious case
of interest. We further specialize to the case where the orientifold involution is a
group automorphism. While this is not the only possibility, and other literature
on WZW orientifolds (for example [39, 16, 38, 17, 35]) deals with the case of group
anti-automorphisms (or twists thereof), the automorphism case certainly seems
like a natural case to consider, and it could be that orientifold theories on a group
G with a group involution ι and Gι = H are related to “coset theories” on G/H.
The T-dualities we exhibit here are motivated by examples of “group duality”
(such as Matsuki duality) that occur in representation theory. We begin with a
proposition which is basically well-known.

Proposition 21. Let G be a connected semi-simple complex Lie group, and let G0
be a real form of G (so that G0 = Gι for some anti-holomorphic involution ι of G).
Let θ be the Cartan involution of G0, with ﬁxed-point subgroup K0 = Gθ
0. Then θ
can be chosen to commute with ι and to extend to a holomorphic involution of G
(which we will again denote by θ) commuting with ι.

GROUP DUALITIES, T-DUALITIES, AND TWISTED K-THEORY

Proof. As we mentioned, this is standard; see for example [25].

25

(cid:3)

Theorem 22. Let G, G0, K0, ι, and θ be as in Proposition 21. Then there is a
natural isomorphism KR•(G, ι) ∼= KR•+2(m−n)(G, θ), where m = dim G0−dim K0,
n = dim K0. The isomorphism can be viewed as coming from a T-duality of
orientifold theories for the two involutions.

Proof. Let g and g0 be the Lie algebras of G and G0, respectively, and let k0
be the Lie algebra of K0, k its complexiﬁcation (the Lie algebra of the complex
subgroup K of G given by K = Gθ). Let τ = θι; since θ and ι commute, this is
also an involution, and it’s anti-holomorphic since θ is holomorphic and ι is anti-
holomorphic. Thus U = Gτ is another real form of G. Let p be the −1-eigenspace
of θ; note that the the −1-eigenspace of ι is ig0. So we have the decomposition

(21)

g = g0 + ig0 = k0 + ik0 + p0 + ip0,

where p0 = p ∩ g0. The Cartan decomposition of G0 is G0 = K0 exp(p0). The
involution τ acts by +1 on k0 and on ip0, and by −1 on ik0 and on p0. The Killing
form is negative deﬁnite on k0 and positive deﬁnite on p0, hence is negative deﬁnite
on u = k0 + ip0, the Lie algebra of U. So U is compact; it is the compact real form
of G (which is unique up to inner automorphisms). So the Cartan decomposition
of G is G = U exp(ik0 + p0).

With all these preliminaries, we can now understand the involutions θ and ι.
Topologically, G = U × (ik0) × p0, where ik0 and p0 are real vector spaces of
dimensions dim K0 and dim G0 − dim K0, respectively. The involutions ι and θ
both send U to itself with ﬁxed-point subgroup K0. But ι is −1 on ik0 and +1 on
p0, whereas θ is +1 on ik0 and −1 on p0. So as Real spaces in the sense of Atiyah
[3], but with the opposite indexing convention as in [47], (G, θ) = (U, θ) × Rn,m,
where n = dim K0 and m = dim G0 − dim K0, while (G, ι) = (U, θ) × Rm,n. So

KR•(G, θ) ∼= KR•−m+n(U, θ), KR•(G, ι) ∼= KR•−n+m(U, θ).

The result follows.

(cid:3)

Remark 23. Theorem 22 may seem too weak since it does not incorporate the
twist in KR-theory given by the B-ﬁeld and H-ﬂux (explained in [21, §4 and §5]).
This may be remedied by observing that the twist is always almost trivial on
the Euclidean space factors k0 and p0, since they are contractible. (The Dixmier-
Douady class must be trivial, and so the only way of twisting is by changing the
signs of the O-planes, which simply shifts KR in degree by 4.) Then as long as
one uses the same twist on (U, θ) and (U, ι), Theorem 22 continues to hold even
in the presence of a topologically nontrivial B-ﬁeld.

Another comment is that it might seem surprising at ﬁrst that the degree shift in
Theorem 22 is always even, unlike the situation for torus orientifolds in [34, 21, 22],
where switching between type IIA and type IIB via a single T-duality involves a
shift of 1. This can be explained by the fact that here we are dealing with a

26

slightly diﬀerent notion of T-duality — it is still “target space” duality, but we
no longer have torus bundles. The simplest case of this new kind of T-duality is
the duality given by the Fourier transform, between R1,0 and R0,1. (The switch
in the involution comes from the fact that the Fourier transform of a real-valued
function satisﬁes f (x) = f (−x), not f (x) = f (x).) For such T-dualities of real or
complex vector spaces, the degree shift in KR-theory is always even.
