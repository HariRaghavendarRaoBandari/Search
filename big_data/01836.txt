LIPSCHITZ RETRACTIONS IN HADAMARD SPACES VIA GRADIENT FLOW

SEMIGROUPS

MIROSLAV BA ˇC ´AK AND LEONID V. KOVALEV

Abstract. Let X(n), for n ∈ N, be the set of all subsets of a metric space (X, d) of cardinality at
most n. The set X(n) equipped with the Hausdorﬀ metric is called a ﬁnite subset space. In this paper
we are concerned with the existence of Lipschitz retractions r : X(n) → X(n − 1) for n ≥ 2. It is known
that such retractions do not exist if X is the one-dimensional sphere. On the other hand L. Kovalev
has recently established their existence in case X is a Hilbert space and he also posed a question as to
whether or not such Lipschitz retractions exist for X being a Hadamard space. In the present paper we
answer this question in the positive.

1. Introduction

Let (X, d) be a metric space. For each n ∈ N, we denote the set of all subsets of X with cardinality at
most n by X(n). The set X(n) equipped with the Hausdorﬀ metric dH is called a ﬁnite subset space. Unlike
Cartesian powers X n or the space of unordered n-tuples X n/Sn, ﬁnite subset spaces admit canonical
isometric embeddings ι : X(n) → X(n + 1).

Following [6, 7, 9], we are interested in Lipschitz retractions r : X(n) → X(n − 1). L. Kovalev proved
their existence for X being a Euclidean space [6] and X being a Hilbert space [7]. On the other hand,
a result of J. Mostovoy [9] yields that in general there is no continuous mapping r : X(n) → X(n − 1)
with r ◦ ι = id if X is the one-dimensional sphere S1; here id stands for the identity operator on X(n). It
is therefore natural to ask whether Lipschitz retractions r : X(n) → X(n − 1) exist if X is a nonpositively
Indeed, this question appears explicitly in [7, Question 3.3]. Our main result
curved metric space.
(Theorem 3.2) provides the positive solution to this problem.

The solution for Hilbert spaces from [7] is based on the existence of gradient ﬂow trajectories in a
ﬁnite dimensional subspace, which is assured by the classical ODE theory. In the present paper, we also
deﬁne the desired retractions via gradient ﬂows of certain convex functionals on (the n-th power of) a
Hadamard space and make use of the Lie-Trotter-Kato formula proved recently in [3, 11].

Finally, note that, given a Hadamard space (H, d), we obtain Lipschitz retractions r : H(n) → H(n− 1)

2. Preliminaries

We ﬁrst recall some basic facts about Hadamard spaces as well as more recent results which shall be

used in our proof. For further details, we refer the reader to [2].

Let (H, d) be a Hadamard space, that is, a complete metric space with geodesics satisfying

(1)

d (z, xt)2 ≤ (1 − t)d (z, x0)2 + td (z, x1)2 − t(1 − t)d (x0, x1)2 ,

for each z, x0, x1 ∈ H and t ∈ [0, 1], where xt := (1 − t)x0 + tx1 is a unique point on the geodesic [x0, x1]
such that d (x0, xt) = td (x0, x1) . An equivalent (and more geometric) formulation of inequality (1) is the
following relation between a triangle with vertices p, q, r ∈ H and its comparison triangle with vertices
p, q, r ∈ R2, where d(p, q) = kp − qk , d(r, q) = kr − qk and d(p, r) = kp − rk . If x := (1 − t)p + tq and
y := (1 − s)p + sr for some s, t ∈ [0, 1], and we denote their comparison points by x := (1 − t)p + tq and
y := (1 − s)p + sr, respectively, inequality (1) implies that

(2)

d (x, y) ≤ kx − yk .

Here the symbol k · k stands for the Euclidean norm on R2.

Given two geodesics [x0, x1] and [y0, y1] , we have

(3)

d (xt, yt) ≤ (1 − t)d (x0, y0) + td (x1, y1) ,

for each t ∈ [0, 1]; see [2, (1.2.4)].

Given a function f : H → (−∞, ∞], denote its domain by dom f := {x ∈ H : f (x) < ∞} and the set of
its minimizers by Min f := {x ∈ H : f (x) = inf f } . We say that a function f : H → (−∞, ∞] is convex if
for each geodesic γ : [0, 1] → H, the function f ◦ γ is convex. Given a convex lower semicontinuous (lsc,
for short) function, its resolvent (with parameter λ > 0) is given by

is

(7)

d (Stx, Sty) ≤ d(x, y),

for each t ∈ [0, ∞) and x, y ∈ dom f. The above mentioned theory of gradient ﬂows in Hadamard spaces
was ﬁrst studied by J. Jost [5] and U. Mayer [8]. A more recent result from [1] established the asymptotic
behavior of a gradient ﬂow. It relies upon the notion of weak convergence in Hadamard spaces, which was
introduced by J. Jost in [4]. Let us recall that a bounded sequence (xk) ⊂ H converges weakly to a point
x ∈ H provided limk→∞ d (Pγ (xk) , x) = 0 for each geodesic γ : [0, 1] → H with x ∈ γ. Here Pγ stands
for the metric projection onto (the image of) γ. Now we are ready to state the theorem on asymptotic
behavior of a gradient ﬂow.

Theorem 2.1. Let f : H → (−∞, ∞] be a convex lsc function which attains its inﬁmum on H. Then,
given x ∈ dom f, the associated gradient ﬂow semigroup weakly converges to a point x∗ ∈ Min f.

Proof. See [1] or [2, Thm 5.1.16].

(cid:3)

The function values then converge to the inﬁmum of f.

Theorem 2.2. Let f : H → (−∞, ∞] be a convex lsc function which attains its inﬁmum on H. Then,
given x ∈ dom f, we have f (Stx) → inf f as t → ∞.

Proof. This can be seen from the proof of Theorem 2.1 in [1], or for instance like in [2, Prop. 5.1.12]. (cid:3)

The proof of our main theorem uses gradient ﬂows of convex functions to deﬁne a desired Lipschitz
retraction. These convex functions have a special form, namely they are given as a ﬁnite sum of some ele-
mentary convex functions, and their gradient ﬂow can be approximated by the Lie-Trotter-Kato formula.
We will now state the necessary facts precisely. Let N ∈ N and consider a function f : H → (−∞, ∞] of
the form

fj,

where fj : H → (−∞, ∞] are convex lsc functions for every j = 1, . . . , N. Let us denote the resolvent of
the function fj by J [j]

(cid:3)

In fact, the gradient ﬂow we are going to use in the proof of Theorem 3.2 is not on H, but on its n-th

power. The n-th power of H, denoted by Hn, is equipped with the metric

d(x, y) := (cid:18) n
Xj=1

x, y ∈ Hn,

and is then also a Hadamard space. Note that we use the same symbol d for the original metric on H as
well as for the metric on Hn. It is always clear from the arguments which one is meant. Given a point
x = (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ Hn, we shall denote {x} := {x1, . . . , xn} , a subset of H. However, given x, y ∈ Hn, we
shall denote the Hausdorﬀ distace between {x} and {y} by dH(x, y) instead of dH ({x}, {y}) .

3. The existence of Lipschitz retractions

The desired Lipschitz retractions r : H(n) → H(n − 1) will be deﬁned via a gradient ﬂow of a convex

functional on Hn. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne this functional as

(10)

F (x) := X1≤i<j≤n

d (xi, xj) ,

x = (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ Hn.

and show that it is indeed convex and Lipschitz.

Lemma 3.1. The function F : Hn → R is convex and n

3

2 -Lipschitz.

Proof. Convexity follows from (3). For the Lipschitz property, we estimate

|F (x) − F (y)| ≤ X1≤i<j≤n

|d (xi, xj) − d (yi, yj)| ≤ X1≤i<j≤n

d (xi, yi) + d (xj , yj) ≤ n

3

2 d(x, y),

where we twice used the triangle inequality and then the Cauchy-Scharz inequality.

(cid:3)

We are now ready to prove the main theorem.

Theorem 3.2. Let (H, d) be a Hadamard space. Then for each integer n ≥ 2 there exists a Lipschitz
retraction r : H(n) → H(n − 1) with Lipschitz constant max(4n

2 + 1, 2n2 + n

2 ).

Proof. We divide the proof into several steps.

Step 1. Let Jλ and St be the resolvent and gradient ﬂow semigroup, respectively, associated with the

function F from (10). Let us denote

D := {x = (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ Hn : xi = xj for some 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} .

Given x ∈ Hn, we deﬁne

(11)

δ(x) := min

1≤i<j≤n

d (xi, xj) .

and T (x) := inf {t > 0 : Stx ∈ D} . We will ﬁrst show that

(12)

T (x) ≤

with the function

x = (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ Hn,

where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n. Then (9) reads

Next we claim that for λ > 0 and i = 3, . . . , n, the following holds:

(i) if d (y1, y2) ≥ λ, then d (z1, z2) ≤ d (y1, y2) ,
(ii) if d (y1, y2) < λ, then d (z1, z2) ≤ d (y1, y2) + λ,
λ J [1,i]

for every y = (y1, . . . , yn) ∈ Hn and z := J [2,i]
y. We will now show both (i) and (ii) by using
λ
comparison triangles. To this end denote u := J [1,i]
y and consider the triangle with vertices y1, y2, ui in
H along with its comparison triangle with vertices y1, y2, ui ∈ R2. Then denote the comparison points of
z1 and z2 by z1 and z2, respectively. Next observe that (i) and (ii) hold true if we replace all the points
involved by their comparison points (and consider the Euclidean distance in R2 of course). This can be
seen by elementary geometry arguments in R2. Finally, applying (2) gives (i) and (ii).

d (xj , yj) .

Step 3. Given x ∈ H(n), we number its elements {x1, . . . , xn} and consider x′ := (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ Hn.

We may assume that d (x1, x2) = δ (x′) . Then we deﬁne r(x) := (cid:8)ST (x′)x′(cid:9) . However, we will write x

instead of x′ in the sequel. Let us now show that r : H(n) → H(n − 1) is a Lipschitz retraction. First
of all, observe that r is the identity on (the canonical embedding of) H(n − 1). To prove the Lipschitz
property, choose x, y ∈ H(n) and examine the following two alternatives. If δ(x) + δ(y) ≤ 4dH(x, y), then

dH (r(x), r(y)) ≤ dH (r(x), x) + dH (x, y) + dH (y, r(y)) ≤ n

3

2 δ(x) + dH(x, y) + n

3

2 δ(y) ≤ (cid:16)4n

3

2 + 1(cid:17) dH(x, y)

where we used (15) to obtain the second inequality.

If, on the other hand, δ(x) + δ(y) > 4dH(x, y), then we may assume δ(x) > 2dH(x, y) without loss of
generality. The fact δ(x) > 2dH(x, y) then implies that we can renumber the points {y1, . . . , yn} in such
a way that

(17)

d (xj, yj) ≤ dH(x, y)

for each j = 1, . . . , n. In the remainder of the proof, we will use (17) only, without referring to δ(x) >
2dH(x, y). We can hence without loss of generality assume T (x) ≤ T (y) on account that the roles of x
and y in (17) are interchangeable. Recall that r(x) = ST (x)x and put z := ST (x)y. Inequality (16) implies
that dH (r(x), z) ≤ n

2 dH(x, y). Consequently,

1

By (15) we have

Finally, one arrives at

δ(z) = δ(z) − δ (r(x)) ≤ 2dH (z, r(x)) ≤ 2n

1

2 dH(x, y).

dH (z, r(z)) ≤ n

3

2 δ(z) ≤ 2n2dH(x, y).

dH (r(x), r(y)) ≤ dH (r(x), z) + dH (z, r(z)) + dH (r(z), r(y)) ≤ n

1

2 dH(x, y) + 2n2dH(x, y) + 0,

where the zero on the right hand side is due to the semigroup property of the gradient ﬂow. The proof
is complete.
(cid:3)

Remark 3.3 (Asymptotic behavior of the ﬂow). Given x ∈ Hn, denote ∆(x) := max1≤i<j≤n d (xi, xj) .
Using the same arguments as in the previous proof, we can show that for τ := 1
2 ∆(x), one obtains
Sτ x ∈ Min F. Alternatively, we can obtain the asymptotic behavior of the ﬂow as follows. By Theorem
2.1, given x ∈ Hn, the ﬂow Stx weakly converges to a point x∗ = (x∗
n) ∈ Min F ; and obviously
x∗
1 = · · · = x∗

n. Next we show that this convergence is in fact strong. To this end, we ﬁrst observe that

1, . . . , x∗

x∗

1 ∈ \t∈[0,∞)

co {Stx} .

Indeed, by virtue of (6) and the semigroup property it is suﬃcient to show that {Jλx} ⊂ co{x}. This
inclusion however follows directly by a projection argument. Now use Theorem 2.2 to conclude F (Stx) →
0 and therefore diam co {Stx} → 0. We hence have Stx → x∗.

Remark 3.4 (Open questions). We end the paper by posing a few questions, many of which have
appeared already in [7]. The Lipschitz constant of r : H(n) → H(n − 1) guaranteed by Theorem 3.2 is
2 ). Can one improve upon this constant? Can one show that, for every n ∈ N
max(4n
with n ≥ 2, there exist Lipschitz retractions r : H(n) → H(n − 1) with Lipschitz constants independent
of n? Can one extend Theorem 3.2 into spaces of nonpositive curvature in the sense of Busemann? In
particular, does an analog of Theorem 3.2 hold in strictly convex or uniformly convex Banach spaces?

LIPSCHITZ RETRACTIONS

7

Can one extend Theorem 3.2 into p-uniformly convex spaces? Recall that a geodesic metric space (X, d)
is called p-uniformly convex (for p ≥ 2) if there exists K > 0 such that

d (z, xt)p ≤ (1 − t)d (z, x0)p + td (z, x1)p − Kt(1 − t)d (x0, x1)p ,

for each z, x0, x1 ∈ H and t ∈ [0, 1], where xt := (1 − t)x0 + tx1. This deﬁnition was introduced in [10,
Deﬁnition 3.2] as a generalization of p-uniform convexity in Banach spaces.
