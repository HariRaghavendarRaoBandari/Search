CONFORMAL GEOMETRY OF TIMELIKE CURVES

IN THE (1 + 2)-EINSTEIN UNIVERSE

AKHTAM DZHALILOV, EMILIO MUSSO, AND LORENZO NICOLODI

Abstract. We study the conformal geometry of timelike curves in the (1 + 2)-
Einstein universe, the conformal compactiﬁcation of Minkowski 3-space deﬁned as
the quotient of the null cone of R2,3 by the action by positive scalar multiplications.
The purpose is to describe local and global conformal invariants of timelike curves
and to address the question of existence and properties of closed trajectories for
the conformal strain functional. Some relations between the conformal geometry of
timelike curves and the geometry of knots and links in the 3-sphere are discussed.

1. Introduction

Conformal Lorentzian geometry has played an important role in general relativity since
the work of H. Weyl [52]. In the 1980s, it has been at the basis of the development of twistor
approach to gravity by Penrose and Rindler [42] and it is one of the main ingredients in the
recently proposed cyclic cosmological models in general relativity [40, 41, 50]. It also plays
a role in the regularization of the Kepler problem [21, 26, 27, 29], in conformal ﬁeld theory
[48], and in Lie sphere geometry [5, 7]. For what concerns in particular the geometry of
curves, while the subject of conformal Lorentzian invariants of null curves has received
some attention [5, 3, 51], that of timelike curves seems to have been little studied before.
In this paper we investigate the geometry of timelike curves in E 1,2, the conformal
compactiﬁcation of Minkowski 3-space deﬁned as the space of oriented null lines of R2,3
through the origin. This study is intended as a preliminary step to understand the 4-
dimensional case, which is that of physical interest. Despite some formal similarities,
there are substantial diﬀerences between the conformal Riemannian and Lorentzian case:
the Lorentzian space E 1,2 has the topology of S1 × S2, which is not simply connected; the
global Lorentzian metrics on E 1,2 are never maximally symmetric; the universal covering
of the conformal group of E 1,2 does not admit ﬁnite dimensional representations and has
a center which is discrete, but not ﬁnite [2, 45]. Following [3, 16], we call E 1,2 the (1 + 2)-
Einstein universe.1 A motivation for this terminology is that the universal covering of E 1,2,
R×S2, endowed with the product metric −dt2+gS2 , provides a static solution of Einstein’s
equation with a positive cosmological constant. This solution was proposed by Einstein
himself as a model of a closed static universe in [11]. In addition, the pseudo-Riemannian
geometries of the standard Friedmann–Lemaitre–Robertson–Walker cosmological models
can be realized as subgeometries of E 1,2 [22].

The purposes of this paper are threefold. The ﬁrst is to describe local and global
conformal diﬀerential invariants of a timelike curve. The second purpose is to address
the question of existence and properties of closed trajectories for the variational problem

deﬁned by the conformal strain functional, the Lorentzian analogue of the conformal
arclength functional in M¨obius geometry [25, 30, 31, 34]. The Lagrangian of the strain
functional depends on third-order jets and shares many similarities with the relativistic
models for massless or massive particles based on higher-order action functionals, a topic
which has been much studied over the past twenty years [15, 19, 23, 32, 33, 35, 36, 43].
The last purpose is to establish a connection between the conformal geometry of timelike
curves in the Einstein universe and the geometry of transversal knots in the unit 3-sphere.
From a physical point of view, the relevant objects are the lifts of timelike curves
to the universal covering of E 1,2 and their global conformal invariants. The compactiﬁed
model has the advantage of having a matrix group as its restricted conformal group, which
simpliﬁes the use of the geometric methods based on the transformation group and eases
the computational aspects.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we collect some background material
about conformal Lorentzian geometry. For the geometry of the Einstein universe, we
mainly follow [3].

In Section 3, we study the conformal geometry of timelike curves in the Einstein uni-
verse. We deﬁne the inﬁnitesimal conformal strain, which is the Lorentzian analogue of
the conformal arc element of a curve in S3 [24, 28, 30, 31, 34], and the notion of a con-
formal vertex. An explicit description of curves all of whose points are vertices is given in
Proposition 1. Next, we deﬁne the concept of osculating conformal cycle and give a geo-
metric characterization of conformal vertices in terms of the analytic contact between the
curve and its osculating cycle (Proposition 2). We then prove the existence of a canonical
conformal frame ﬁeld along a generic timelike curve (i.e., a timelike curve without vertices)
and deﬁne the two conformal curvatures, which are the main local conformal invariants of
a generic curve (Theorem 3). As a byproduct, some elementary consequences are derived
(Propositions 4, 5 and 6 and Corollary 7).

In Section 4, the canonical conformal frame is used to investigate generic timelike curves
with constant conformal curvatures. We exhibit explicit parameterizations of such curves
in terms of elementary functions (Theorems 8 and 9) and discuss their main geometric
properties. These are the Lorentzian counterparts of analogous results for curves with
constant conformal curvatures in S3 [47].

In Section 5, we use the canonical frame to compute the Euler-Lagrange equations of
the conformal strain functional (Theorem 10). Consequently we show that the conformal
curvatures of the extrema can be expressed in terms of Jacobi’s elliptic functions. As a
byproduct, we show that the conformal equivalence classes of critical curves depend on two
real constants and prove that there exist countably many distinct conformal equivalence
classes of closed trajectories for the strain functional (Theorem 11).

In Section 6, we establish a connection between the conformal geometry of timelike
curves and the geometry of transversal knots in the S3 via the directrices of a generic
timelike curve. These are immersed curves in S3, everywhere transverse to the canonical
contact distribution, which are built using the symplectic lift of the canonical conformal
frame. If the directrices of a generic closed timelike curve are simple, then their linking
and Bennequin numbers [17] provide three global conformal invariants, diﬀerent in general
from the Maslov index of the curve. These invariants are computed for the directrices of
a special class of closed timelike curves with constant conformal curvatures (Proposition
12). It is still an open question how the local symplectic invariants [1, 8] of the directrices
can be related to the strain and the conformal curvatures. A more diﬃcult problem is
to understand how the classical and non-classical invariants of transversal knots of S3
[12, 13, 14, 17] are related to the conformal geometry of closed timelike curves.

V3
+ = [P o
4 ]. Let (x0, . . . , x4) be the Cartesian coordinates of the standard Poincar´e
basis and denote by E 1,2 the 3-dimensional submanifold of R2,3 deﬁned by the equations
4 = 1. As a manifold, E 1,2 is the Cartesian product S1− × S2
x2
0 + x2
+
of the unit circle of V2− with the 2-dimensional unit sphere of V3
+. The scalar product on
R2,3 induces a Lorentzian pseudo-metric ge on E 1,2. The normal bundle of E 1,2 is spanned
by the restrictions of the vector ﬁelds n1 = x0∂x0 + x1∂x1 and n2 = x2∂x2 + x3∂x3 + x4∂x4 .
Thus, contracting dV with n1 and n2, we get a volume form on E 1,2 which in turn deﬁnes
an orientation on E 1,2. The vector ﬁeld −x1∂x0 + x0∂x1 is tangent to E 1,2 and induces a
nowhere vanishing timelike vector ﬁeld t on E 1,2. We time-orient E 1,2 by requiring that t
is future-oriented.
Deﬁnition 1. The Lorentzian manifold (E 1,2, ge), with the above speciﬁed orientation
and time-orientation, is called the (1 + 2)-Einstein universe. The Einstein universe is a
homogeneous Lorentzian manifold and its restricted isometry group is a 4-dimensional
maximal compact subgroup of A

+(2, 3), isomorphic to SO(2) × SO(3).

Φ : E 1,2 (cid:51) X (cid:55)→ [X] ∈ M1,2

For each non-zero vector X ∈ R2,3, we denote by [X] the oriented line spanned by X
(i.e., the ray of X). The set of all null rays, denoted by M1,2 is a manifold and the map
(2.2)
is a diﬀeomorphism. This allows us to identify E 1,2 with M1,2 and to transfer to M1,2 the
oriented, time-oriented conformal Lorentzian structure of E 1,2. We will make no distinction
between the two models and the context will make clear which of them is being used. Using
↑
the above identiﬁcation, the automorphism group A
+(2, 3) acts eﬀectively and transitively
on the left of E 1,2 ∼= M1,2 by F · X = [F (X)], for each F ∈ A
+(2, 3) and [X] ∈ M1,2. The

a classical result that every restricted conformal transformation of the Einstein universe

(restricted) conformal group of the Einstein universe. The map

τ : E 1,2 (cid:51) X (cid:55)→ (x0x2 − x1(x3 + 2), x1x2 + x0(x3 + 2), x4) ∈ R3

is a 2:1 branched covering onto the toroid T ⊂ R3 swept out by the rotation around the
z-axis of the unit disk in the xz-plane centered at (2, 0, 0). Thus, the Einstein universe can
be identiﬁed with the quotient space T(cid:116) T/ ∼ of the disjoint union T(cid:116) T = T×{−1, 1} of
two copies of the toroid T modulo the equivalence relation deﬁned by [(P, )]∼ = {(P, )},
if P ∈ Int(T), and [(P, )]∼ = {(P,±)}, if P ∈ ∂T.
In what follows we will use the
“toroidal” projection τ to visualize and clarify the geometrical content of the results.

2.3. Conformal embeddings of Lorentzian space forms. As a model for anti-de
Sitter 3-space, we consider the hyperquadric of R4

M(1,2)−1 = {(x, y) ∈ R4 : −(x1)2 − (x2)2 + (y1)2 + (y2)2 = −1}

equipped with the Lorentzian structure induced by the neutral scalar product

(x,(cid:101)x)(2,2) = −x1(cid:101)x1 − x1(cid:101)x1 + y1(cid:101)y1 + y2(cid:101)y2.

Sitter space inside E 1,2. The restriction of the branched covering τ to each of the two
adS-chambers is a smooth diﬀeomorhism onto the interior of T, while the restriction of τ
to the adS-wall is a diﬀeomorphism onto ∂T (see Figure 1).

+ =
2 ∧ P o
[P o
4 ] are smooth curves, referred to as the time- and space-component of γ,
In particular, γ is timelike if and only if −(cid:104)η(cid:48), η(cid:48)(cid:105) > (cid:104)β(cid:48), β(cid:48)(cid:105) ≥ 0 and is

j : V− → V− is the counterclockwise rotation of an angle π/2 in the oriented, negative
deﬁnite Euclidean plane V2−. Henceforth, we only consider future-directed timelike curves.
Deﬁnition 2. The Maslov index of a closed timelike curve is the degree is its time-
component.
Deﬁnition 3. If γ : I → E 1,2 is a timelike curve, then γ|t, γ(cid:48)|t, γ(cid:48)(cid:48)|t span an oriented
3-dimensional vector subspace of R2,3 of signature (−,−, +). Such a subspace, denoted by
T |t, is called the conformal osculating space of γ at γ(t). Its orthogonal complement N|t
is the normal conformal space of γ at γ(t). The orthogonal projection onto the normal
spaces is denoted by πN|t. The continuous function

|(cid:104)γ(cid:48), γ(cid:48)(cid:105)|

υγ = 4

is called the strain density of γ. The exterior diﬀerential form σγ := υγdt is the inﬁni-
tesimal strain. In the proof of Theorem 3 below, we will show that σγ is invariant under
the action of the conformal group and changes of parameter. The strain is a function
uγ : I → R, such that duγ = σγ. By construction, the strain is a non-decreasing function
of class C 1, uniquely deﬁned up to an additive constant. A point γ(t0) is called a confor-
mal vertex if the inﬁnitesimal strain vanishes at t0. A timelike curve without conformal
vertices is said generic. If υγ = 0, γ is said a conformal cycle.

Remark 1. The strain and the inﬁnitesimal strain are dimensionless quantities. The
inﬁnitesimal strain is the Lorentzian analogue of the conformal arc element of a curve in
the 3-dimensional round sphere [24, 30, 34].

Deﬁnition 4. Two timelike curves γ : I → E 1,2 and (cid:101)γ : (cid:101)I → E 1,2 are said to be con-
formally equivalent to each other if there exist a change of parameters f : I → (cid:101)I and a

restricted conformal transformation F ∈ A

Proof. It is quite easy to see that the normal and osculating spaces of a conformal cycle
are constants. By possibly applying a restricted conformal transformation, we may assume
that the osculating space coincides with [M o

Remark 2. A conformal cycle consists of the null rays belonging to the intersection of the
null cone of R2,3 with a 3-dimensional linear subspace of type (2, 1). Therefore, the totality
of conformal cycles can be identiﬁed with G2,1(R2,3), the 6-dimensional Grassmannian of
3-dimensional timelike subspaces of type (2, 1). This also shows that any conformal cycle is
invariant under a 3-dimensional group of restricted conformal transformations isomorphic

to O
+(2, 1).
Given a timelike curve γ : I → E 1,2, the totality of null rays belonging to T |t0 is the
osculating cycle of γ at γ(t0). We give two characterizations of conformal vertices using
osculating cycles. The proof of the results relies on simple computations and is omitted.

Proposition 2. Let γ be a timelike curve. Then:

• The osculating cycle of γ at γ(t0) has second order analytic contact with γ at
γ(t0). In addition, γ(t0) is a conformal vertex if and only if the order of analytic
contact is strictly bigger than 2.

imal distorsion of the curve from its osculating cycle.

A conformal frame along γ is of ﬁrst order if M0 ∧ M(cid:48)

The following are standard but relevant consequences of the existence of a canonical

frame.

Proposition 4. A generic timelike curve can be parametrized is such a way that σγ coin-
cides with the diﬀerential of the independent variable. In this case, we say that the curve
is parametrized by conformal parameter, which is usually denoted by u. The conformal
parameter is uniquely deﬁned up to a constant, u → u + c.

Remark 4. Let γ and(cid:101)γ be two generic timelike and future-directed curves, parametrized
a shift of the independent variable, so that γ(u) = F ·(cid:101)γ(u + c), where c is a real constant
k(u) =(cid:101)k(u + c) and h(u) =(cid:101)h(u + c), for each u ∈ I.

by conformal parameter. If they are equivalent to each other, the change of parameter is
and F ∈ A

↑
+(2, 3) is a conformal transformation. The conformal curvatures are related by

Remark 5. From now on, when considering a generic timelike curve parametrized by
conformal parameter, we suppose that its interval of deﬁnition I be maximal. In this case,
I is called the proper interval of γ.

Proposition 5. Two timelike curves γ,(cid:101)γ parametrized by conformal parameter are equiv-
alent to each other if and only if I = (cid:101)I + c, k(u) = (cid:101)k(u + c), and h(u) =(cid:101)h(u + c), for

2−M 4

some constant c.
Deﬁnition 5. Given two smooth functions k, h : I → R, let K(h, k) denote the m(2, 3)-
valued map deﬁned by K(h, k) := M 0
1 . The curvatures and the canonical
frame can be used to build the curvature operator of γ, i.e., the map Kγ : I → a(2, 3)
deﬁned by MK(h, k) M∗, where k, h are the conformal curvatures, M is the canonical
conformal frame and M∗|t = t(M 0|t, . . . , M 4|t) is the dual basis of M|t, for each t ∈ I.
Proposition 6. If k, h : I → R are two smooth functions, then there is a generic timelike
curve γ, parametrized by conformal parameter, whose canonical conformal frame M sat-
isﬁes the conformal Frenet equations M(cid:48) = MK(k, h). By construction, k and h are the
conformal curvatures of γ, which is unique, up to a restricted conformal transformation.

As a consequence of the previous results, we have the following.

Corollary 7. The ﬁrst conformal curvature k vanishes identically if and only if there
exists a restricted conformal transformation F ∈ A
+(2, 3), such that the trajectory of F ◦ γ
↑
belongs to the adS-wall of the Einstein universe.

Proof. The conformal curvature k is identically zero if and only if M3, the third vector of
the canonical moving frame, is constant. This is equivalent to the existence of a restricted
conformal transformation F ∈ A
+(2, 2), such that the null ray F ◦γ(u) is orthogonal to the
↑
third vector of the standard Poincar´e basis of R2,3, i.e., if and only if F ◦ γ(u) ∈ T∞. (cid:3)

4. Timelike curves with constant conformal curvatures

If we act on a generic timelike curve with a time-preserving and orientation-reversing
conformal transformation, the ﬁrst curvature changes sign. Therefore, without loss of
generality, we may assume k ≥ 0. Consequently, the conformal equivalence classes of
generic timelike curves with constant conformal curvatures can be parametrized in terms
+ = {(k, h) ∈ R2 : k ≥ 0}. In
of two real parameters (k, h) belonging to the half plane R2
principle, since any timelike curve with constant curvatures is an orbit of a 1-parameter
↑
+(2, 3) generated by the curvature operator Kγ, the explicit determination of
subgroup of A
timelike curves with constant curvatures can be reduced to compute Exp(tKγ). However,
the parametrizations obtained in this way lack in general a direct geometric interpretation
suitable for the description of curve trajectories. Some additional work is required. We
classify the generic homogeneous curves with k > 0 in terms of the stratiﬁcation of R2
determined by the orbit-type of K(k, h). There are nine classes, namely:

The curvature operators of homogeneous curves of the ﬁrst four classes are regular elements
of the Lie algebra a(2, 3).
In the other cases, the curvature operators are exceptional
elements of a(2, 3). For this reason, the homogeneous curves of the ﬁrst four classes are
said regular, while those belonging to the last ﬁve classes are said exceptional. We now
describe explicit parametrizations of homogeneous timelike curves in terms of elementary
functions. For the classes of regular curves, we have the following.

Figure 7. Curves with constant curvatures of the Classes C6 (on the

a(1 + b)) < 0} such that, after a change of the independent variable, the curve is
parametrized by R (cid:51) t (cid:55)→ [γ(a,b)(t)], where

γ(a,b)(t) = x0(t)L0 + x1(t)L1 −(cid:112)2(1 − a2)L2 + x3(t)L3 + x4(t)L4

(a, b) of Ω2.i = (0, 1) × (0, 1) such that, after a change of variable, the curve is

• If γ belongs to C3, there exists a unique Lie basis (L0, . . . , L4) and a unique
element (a, b) of the domain Ω3 = {(a, b) ∈ R2 : a > 1/4, b > 1, 4a(b2 − 1) −

It is now a computational matter to check that (cid:104)Mi, Mj(cid:105) = mij, i, j = 0, 1, 2, 4. Then, if we
let M3 be the unique spacelike vector ﬁeld along γ, such that M|t = (M0, M1, M2, M3, M4)|t
is a M¨obius basis, for each t ∈ R, we obtain a conformal moving frame satisfying M(cid:48) =

(cid:115)

This shows that M is the canonical conformal frame along γ and, in addition, that the
conformal curvatures of γ are the constants k and h in (4.8).

Let (a, b) be an element of Ω1 and let γ(a,b) be given as in (4.3). From (4.8), we compute

the following expressions for the conformal curvatures of γ(a,b),

k(a,b) =

(1 + b2)(1 − a2)

h(a,b) =

1 − 6b2 + b4 + 8ab(b2 − 1) − a2(b4 − 6b2 + 1)

4b(1 + a2)(1 + b2)

.

The map (a, b) (cid:55)→ (k(a,b), h(a,b)) is a diﬀeomorphism of Ω1 onto C1, and hence each homo-
geneous curve of the ﬁrst class is parametrized by γ(a,b), for a unique (a, b) ∈ Ω1.
Let (a, b) ∈ Ω2.i and γ(a,b) be given as in (4.4). Then, using (4.8), we obtain

Since the map (a, b) (cid:55)→ (k(a,b), h(a,b)) is a diﬀeomorphism of Ω2.i onto C2.i, we deduce that
each homogeneous curve of the ﬁrst type of the second class is parametrized by γ(a,b), for
a unique (a, b) ∈ Ω2.i.

The map (a, b) (cid:55)→ (k(a,b), h(a,b)) is a diﬀeomorphism of Ω4 onto C4, so that each homoge-
neous curve of the third class is parametrized by γ(a,b), for a unique (a, b) ∈ Ω4.
(cid:3)

Remark 6. The curves of the ﬁrst class can be trapped in an adS-chamber, but not in a
Minkowski or a dS-chamber. They have two distinct asymptotic closed null curves lying
in an adS-wall (see Figure 4). The curves of the second class may be trapped in an
adS-chamber. If b is a rational number m/n, the curves are closed torus knots of type
(n, m). Otherwise they are “irrational” lines of a homogeneous torus. They cannot be
trapped in a Minkowski or a dS-chamber. The integer m is the liking number of the
toroidal projection with the z-axis, while n is the linking number with the centerline of
the toroid (see Figure 5). The homogeneous curves of the third class can be trapped in the
intersection of three chambers of diﬀerent types, anti-de Sitter, de Sitter, or Minkowski.
They have two limit points lying on the intersection of the walls of the three chambers
trapping the curve (see Figure 4). Also the homogeneous curves of the fourth class are
trapped in the intersection of three chambers of diﬀerent types. They have two limit points
belonging to the adS-chamber. One of them lies in the intersection of the Minkowski-wall
with one of the dS-walls, while the other lies in the intersection of the Minkowski-wall
with the other dS-wall (see Figure 6).

Arguing as in the proof of Theorem 8, we can prove the following result for the classes

of exceptional curves.

Theorem 9. Let γ be an exceptional homogeneous curve. Then the following hold true:
• If γ ∈ C5, there is a unique M¨obius basis (M0, . . . , M4) and a unique b > 1 such
that, after a change of variable, the curve is parameterized by R (cid:51) t (cid:55)→ [γ(b)(t)],

Remark 7. The curves of the ﬁfth class are equivalent to timelike round helices of Minkowski
space (with a timelike axis). They are trapped in the intersection of a Minkowski-chamber
with an adS-chamber. They spiral toward one of the two vertices of the Minkowski-wall
and in the interior of the adS-chamber. Such curves cannot be trapped in any dS-chamber
(see Figure 6). The curves of the sixth class are equivalent to timelike “hyperbolic” helices
of Minkowski space (with a spacelike axis). They are trapped in the intersection of three
chamber of diﬀerent types and have two distinct limit points lying in the interior of the
adS-chamber and on the intersections of the Minokowski-wall with one of the dS-walls
(see Figure 7). The curves of the seventh class can be trapped in an adS-chamber but not

in a Minkowski or dS-chamber. They have one asymptotic closed null curve lying in the
adS-wall (see Figure 7). The curves of the eighth class can be trapped in the intersections
of an adS-chamber with a Minkowski-chamber but cannot be trapped in a dS-chamber.
They have two distinct limit points lying in the adS-wall (see Figure 8). One of the limit
points is the vertex of the Minkowski wall. The curves of the ninth class are all equiv-
alent to each other; they can be trapped in the intersections of an adS-chamber with a
Minkowski-chamber but cannot be trapped in a dS-chamber. They have a unique limit
point, one of the two vertices of the Minkowski wall. Such curves close up smoothly at
inﬁnity (see Figure 8).

5. The conformal strain functional

5.1. The Euler-Lagrange equations. A variation of a curve γ : I ⊂ R → E 1,2 is a map
Γ : I × (−, ) → E 1,2 such that Γ(u, 0) = γ(u), for every u ∈ I. Given t ∈ (−, ), we
write γ[t] to denote the curve I (cid:51) u (cid:55)→ Γ(u, t). If Γ(u, t) = γ(u), for every u outside a
closed subinterval K ⊂ I and for every t ∈ (−, ), we say that the variation is compactly
supported. The smallest of all such closed subintervals is the support of the variation. If
γ is generic and timelike and Γ is compactly supported then, up to choosing  suﬃciently
small, the curves γ[t] are generic and timelike, for every t. In the latter case we say that
the variation is admissible. Given a closed interval K ⊂ I, the total strain of the timelike
arc γ(K) is the integral

We say that γ is a critical curve of the conformal strain functional if

SK(γ) =

Theorem 10. A generic timelike curve parametrized by conformal parameter is a critical
curve of the conformal strain functional if and only if

(5.1)

¨k − k3 + 2kh = 0,

˙h − 3k ˙k = 0.

Proof. First, we prove that any timelike generic curve satisfying (5.1) is a critical point of
the conformal strain functional. So, assume that (5.1) is satisﬁed and let Γ be an admissible
variation. Let υ[t], k[t] and h[t] denote the strain density and the conformal curvatures
of γ[t] and set v(u, t) = υ[t](u), k(u, t) = k[t](u), h(u, t) = h[t](u). These functions satisfy
v(u, t) = 1, k(u, t) = k(u) and h(u, t) = h(u), for every (u, t) /∈ K × (−, ), where K
denotes the support of the variation. Note that since γ is parametrized by conformal
parameter, then v(u, 0) = 1, for every u ∈ I. Consider the map ˜M : I × (−, ) → M,
such that ˜M(u, t) = M[t](u), where M[t] is the canonical frame along γ[t], and let U,
V : I × (−, ) → m(2, 3) denote the maps such that ∂u ˜M = ˜MU and ∂t ˜M = ˜MV. From
the Maurer–Cartan equations, it follows that

From (5.6) and (5.7), it follows that γ is a critical curve if (5.1) is satisﬁed.

Conversely, it suﬃces to prove that for each u0 ∈ I there exists a closed interval K ⊂ I,
containing u0, such that, for every pair of smooth functions v, w : I → R whose supports
are contained in K, there exists a compactly supported variation satisfying v1
4 = v
and v3
4 = w. Since this property is local and invariant under the action of the conformal
group, we may assume that the trajectory of the curve is contained in jm(M(1,2)
). We can
then write

F[t](u). Then, for every t ∈ (−, ), there exists a unique map ˜X[t] : I → M
such that M[t] = F[t] · ˜X[t] is the canonical frame along γ[t] and that ˜X[0] = X.

where U (u) = X(u)−1 · ( ˜F−1∂t ˜F)|(u,0) · X(u) and W (u) = ( ˜X−1∂t ˜X)|(u,0). Let V0 =

Remark 8. A generic timelike curve with constant curvatures can be a critical point of
the strain functional if and only if k3 = 2kh. Thus, assuming k > 0, these curves belong
to the classes C1, C4 or C9.

Remark 9. Within the general scheme of Griﬃths’ formalism of the calculus of variations
[20], using the Euler–Lagrange equations and the existence of the canonical frame, one can
build a dynamical system deﬁned on an appropriate momentum space in such a way that
the projections of its trajectories on the Einstein universe are the critical curves of the
variational problem. More speciﬁcally, the momentum space Y is the Cartesian product
M × R3 with ﬁber coordinates (k, ˙k, h) equipped with the projection πY : (M, k, ˙k, h) ∈
Y → [M0] ∈ E 1,2. The exterior diﬀerential 1-forms µ0

• k, h are its conformal curvatures and ˙k is the derivative of k;

5.2. The conformal curvatures of the extrema. From now on we consider critical
curves with non-constant curvatures. Then (5.1) implies that γ is a critical curve if and

We say that e1, e2 are the parameters of the critical curve.

Deﬁnition 6. The phase portrait of a critical curve with parameters e1 and e2 is the real
algebraic curve Fe1,e2 ⊂ R2 deﬁned by the equation y2 + (x2 − e1)(x2 − e2) = 0.

Three possibilities may occur depending on whether 0 < e1 < e2, e1 < 0 < e2, or e1 =
0 < e2. Correspondingly, we have a partition of D into three regions: D1 = {(e1, e2) ∈ D :
0 < e1 < e2}, D2 = {(e1, e2) ∈ D : e1 < 0 < e2} and D3 = {(e1, e2) ∈ D : e1 = 0 < e2}.
Phase-Type 1. If (e1, e2) ∈ D1, the phase portrait Fe1,e2 is the real part of a smooth
elliptic curve. It consists of two ovaloids, one of them belongs to the half plane x > 0
while the other is the mirror image of the ﬁrst by the reﬂection about the y-axis (see
Figure 9). Thus, the ﬁrst conformal curvature is either strictly positive or else strictly

transformation, we may assume k > 0. We put

From (5.15) it follows that the conformal curvatures of a critical curve with parameters
(e1, e2) ∈ D1 are

h(u) = 1

where nd(·, m) is the Jacobi nd-function with parameter m. By possibly shifting the
independent variable, we can assume c = 0.
Phase-Type 2. If (e1, e2) ∈ D2, then Fe1,e2 is the real part of a smooth elliptic curve.
Unlike the previous case, Fe1,e2 is connected and symmetric with respect to the reﬂections
about the coordinate axes (see Figure 9). Given (e1, e2) ∈ D2, let
p2 = e2 − e1 > 0.

Again, by possibly shifting the independent variable, we take c = 0.

Phase-Type 3.
If e1 = 0 and e2 > 0, the phase portrait is a rational Lemniscate,
symmetric with respect to the reﬂections about the coordinate axes, with the double
point located at the origin (see Figure 9). By possibly acting by a time-preserving and
orientation-reversing conformal transformation, we may assume that k > 0. We then have

Remark 10. Let γ be a critical curve with conformal curvatures k, h as in (5.17), (5.19),
or (5.20). Let K(h, k) = M 0
1 , as in Section 3.1, and deﬁne H :=
−M 0
2 . A direct computation shows that H satisﬁes the
Lax equation H(cid:48) = [H,K]. Let M be the canonical frame ﬁeld along γ. Since M(cid:48) = MK,
it follows from the Lax equation that (MHM−1)(cid:48) = 0, which implies the existence of a
constant element mγ ∈ m(2, 3), the momentum of γ, such that mγ = MHM−1, along γ.
This is a consequence of the Noether conservation theorem and of the invariance of the
strain functional under the action of the conformal group.

Once the curvatures of the extrema are known, the determination of their trajectories
amounts to the integration of the 5 × 5 linear system X(cid:48) = K(h, k)X, where h, k are as
in (5.17), (5.19), or (5.20). Such systems can be integrated in terms of elliptic functions
and elliptic integrals. The integration of timelike trajectories is based on the study of
their phase types and of the orbit types of their momenta. The detailed analysis produces
ﬁfteen cases, to be treated one by one.

Theorem 11. There exist countably many distinct conformal equivalence classes of closed
critical curve of the the conformal strain functional.

Proof. Suppose (e1, e2) belongs to D∗ = {(a, b) ∈ D : b− a > 2, a + b < −(cid:112)(a − b)2 − 4}.

In this case, the phase portrait is of the second type, so the curvatures are as in (5.19)

6. Timelike curves and transversal knots in S3

In this section we establish and discuss a connection between the conformal Lorentzian
geometry of timelike curves and the geometry of transversal knots in the unit 3-sphere.
We begin by recalling some background material about knots and links, the symplectic
group, and the standard contact structure of the 3-sphere.

6.1. Preliminaries and notation. Let M be the unit sphere S3 or the Euclidean space
R3. On S3 ⊂ R4, we ﬁx the orientation deﬁned by the volume form Vol|p = −i∗
p(dy1 ∧
dy2 ∧ dy3 ∧ dy4), where (y1, . . . , y4) are the standard coordinates of R4 and i : S3 (cid:44)→ R4
is the standard inclusion. In R3 we choose the natural orientation deﬁned by the volume
form Vol = dx1 ∧ dx2 ∧ dx3.
A knot K ⊂ M is a simple, closed oriented curve. Let N(K) be the normal bundle of
the knot. For each  > 0, we put N(K) = {(p,
X(cid:107) < }. If  is suﬃciently
small, there exists a tubular neighborhood U ⊂ M of K and a diﬀeomorphism Φ of N(K)
onto U. The orientations of M and K determine an orientation on Np(K), for every p ∈ K.
−→
Fix p0 ∈ K, a positive-oriented orthogonal basis (
−→
V 2) of Np0 (K) and a positive number
η ∈ (0, ). Let Γp0 (η) ⊂ N(K) be the oriented circle {(p0, η(cos(θ)
V 2) : θ ∈
R}. Then, the homology class of Φ(Γp0 (η)) is a generator of the ﬁrst homology group
H1(M \ K, Z) that we use to identify H1(M \ K, Z) and Z.
Deﬁnition 7. A link of M is an ordered pair (K,(cid:98)K) of disjoint knots. Its linking number,
denoted by Lk(K,(cid:98)K), is the integer that corresponds to the homology class of (cid:98)K in H1(M \

the computation of the linking number of a spherical link can be reduced to that of the
linking number of a link in R3. The latter can be evaluated by means of its link diagram.

Denote by st : S3 \ {P} → R3 the composition of the stereographic projection from P
with the reﬂection of R3 with respect to the coordinate xy-plane. This is an orientation-

preserving conformal mapping such that Lk(K,(cid:98)K) = Lk(st(K), st((cid:98)K)). Thus, in principle,
More precisely, given a link (K,(cid:98)K) in R3, we ﬁx a plane and consider the orthogonal
projections Ko and (cid:98)Ko of the knots onto this plane. For a generic choice of the plane,
the curves Ko and (cid:98)Ko are immersed and intersect each other transversely in a ﬁnite
number of crossing points p1, . . . , pr. Let γ,(cid:98)γ : R → R3 be smooth parametrizations of
K and (cid:98)K, respectively, with the same minimal period ω > 0. Correspondingly, we have
smooth parametrizations γo and (cid:98)γo of Ko and (cid:98)Ko.
If tj,(cid:101)tj ∈ [0, ω) are chosen so that
γo(tj) =(cid:98)γo((cid:101)tj) = pj, the index of pj is deﬁned by
(pj) = sgn((γ(tj) −(cid:98)γ((cid:101)tj)) · (γ

Deﬁnition 10. The linking number LkK(
self-linking number of K and will be denoted by SL(K).

In the literature, the Bennequin number of a transverse knot of S3 is sometime referred
to as the self-linking number of the knot. To avoid confusion, we will not follow this
practice. The self-linking number is invariant only under regular isotopies, i.e., isotopies
through simple closed curves without inﬂection points. In this respect, it is a geometric
invariant, but not a topological one. Examples of torus knots in Euclidean space of the
same type but with diﬀerent self-linking numbers are given in [2].

Remark 13. In some cases, the self-linking number can be computed in terms of the

integral writhe of the knot relative to a ﬁxed nonzero vector −→v ∈ R3 in general position
with respect to K (i.e., the projection Ko of K onto a plane orthogonal to −→v is an immersed
curve with ordinary double points). We recall that the integral writhe of K with respect
to −→v , denoted by WrK(−→v ), is the sum of the indices of the double points of Ko. The
index of a double point p ∈ Ko can be deﬁned as in Remark 12. Namely, we take a
parametrization γo : R → [−→v ]⊥ ⊂ R3 of Ko, induced by a periodic parametrization
γ : R → R3 of K. By possibly replacing −→v with −−→v , we may assume that γo is compatible
with the counterclockwise orientation of Ko with respect to normal unit vector −→v . If p
is a double point of Ko, let t, t(cid:48) ∈ [0, ω) such that γo(t) = γo(t(cid:48)) = p and γ3(t) > γ3(t(cid:48))
(i.e., γ(t) − γ(t(cid:48)) is a positive multiple of the unit vector −→v ). Then, the index of p is
(p) = sgn(−→v · (γ(cid:48)|t × γ(cid:48)|t(cid:48) ) and the integral writhe of K with respect to −→v is deﬁned by

The proof of this assertion can be found in [44].

(6.3)

ˇΓp,q(t) =

4 cos(pt) − 5

(3 sin(qt), 4 sin(pt),−3 cos(qt)) .

It is a computational matter to check that ˇKp,q has no inﬂection points and that its
projection onto the xz-plane is locally convex and possesses pq − p double points, all of
them with index 1 (see Figure 12). From this we can conclude that SL( ˇKp,q) = pq − p.

are the 4 × 4 matrices of the form A(a, b, c) =

Such an action preserves the standard oriented contact structure on S3 deﬁned by the
1-form ζ. Next, consider the 6-dimensional vector space Λ2(R4) of skew-symmetric 2-
forms of R4. The linear symplectic group acts on the left on Λ2(R4) by X (cid:63) α(x, y) =
−1 · y), for every X ∈ Sp(R4, ω), α ∈ Λ2(R4) and x, y ∈ R4. The vector
α(X
space Λ2(R4) can be equipped with the Sp(R4, ω)-invariant neutral scalar product (α, β),
deﬁned by (α, β)ω2 = α ∧ β, ∀ α, β ∈ Λ2(R4). By construction, ω is a spacelike vector
so that its polar space [ω]⊥ is a 5-dimensional invariant subspace of signature (2, 3). Let

6.3. Directrices. Let γ : I → E 1,2 be a generic timelike curve parametrized by the
conformal parameter and let M : I → M be its canonical frame. Using the identiﬁcation
of M with A

+(2, 3), let (cid:102)M : R → Sp(4, R) be a lift of M to Sp(4, R). Then, it follows
that Γ = |(cid:102)M3|−1(cid:102)M3 and Γ∗ = |(cid:102)M4|−1(cid:102)M4 are smooth maps into the 3-sphere, which are
referred to as the directrices of γ. Using the isomorphism ∗, it is easily seen that (cid:102)M
satisﬁes (cid:102)M(cid:48) =(cid:102)M(cid:101)K(h, k), where k and h are the conformal curvatures of γ and (cid:101)K(h, k) is

This implies that the directrices are immersed curves of S3, everywhere transverse to the
contact distribution of S3. If γ is a simple closed curve, with minimal period (cid:96), then Γ

and Γ∗ are periodic, with minimal period (cid:101)(cid:96) = (cid:96)/σ∗, where σ∗ ∈ {1, 1/2} is the symplectic
timelike curves). Consequently, Γ and Γ∗ originate smooth immersions of the circle R/(cid:101)(cid:96)Z

spin of γ. Note that σ∗ is invariant by regular timelike homotopies (i.e., through generic

into the 3-sphere. If the trajectories of Γ and Γ∗ are simple and disjoint, one can compute
the linking number Lk(Γ, Γ∗) and the Bennequin numbers b(Γ) and b(Γ∗). These three
integers provide global conformal invariants of γ, diﬀerent in general from the Maslov
index of γ. The next Proposition explains how to compute these invariants for a closed
homogeneous timelike curve of the class C2.i considered in Section 4 (see Figure 13).

Proposition 12. Let γ be a closed homogeneous curve of the second class and of the ﬁrst
type, with parameters a ∈ (0, 1) and 0 < b = m/n < 1. Then, the following hold true:

(1) n is its Maslov index;
(2) the curve has symplectic spin 1/2;
(3) if p and q are the relatively prime positive integers deﬁned by p/q = (n− m)/(n +
m), then its directrices Γ and Γ∗ are transversal positive torus knots of type (q, p)
such that Lk(Γ, Γ∗) = pq and b(Γ) = b(Γ∗) = pq − (p + q).

Proof. (1) The assertion follows immediately from formula (4.5) of Theorem 8.

(2) Consider the parametrization of γ given by the natural parameter so that, up to

the action of the conformal group,

γ(u) = [Mo · Exp(uK(h, k)) · t(1, 0, 0, 0)],

where h and k are the constants deﬁned as in (4.9) and K(h, k) is the element of m(2, 3)
2 − M 4
deﬁned by K(h, k) := M 0
1 . This is a simple element of m(2, 3) with
eigenvalues 0, ±iλ1, ±iλ2, where

Since λ1/λ2 = b = m/n, the minimal period of γ (i.e., the total strain of the curve) is

(cid:112)1 + b2(a2 − 1)
(1 − a2)1/4(cid:112)b(1 − b2)

Let (cid:101)K(h, k)) ∈ sp(4, R) be given as in (6.5). Then, putting

the two directrices of γ are parameterized by

respectively. The matrix (cid:101)K(h, k) is a simple element and has four purely imaginary distinct
eigenvalues, ±i(cid:101)λ1, ±i(cid:101)λ2, where
Thus,(cid:101)λ1/(cid:101)λ2 = (n+m)/(n−m). This implies that the two directrices have minimal period
ω∗(a, m/n) = 2π(n + m)/(cid:101)λ2(n − m) = 2ω(a, m/n). This proves that the symplectic spin

Consequently, φ is homotopic to R/2πZ (cid:51) [u] (cid:55)→ t(cos(qu),− sin(qu)), and hence

This proves that b((cid:98)KA,p,q) = pq − p − q, as claimed.

Remark 15. The proposition above implies as a consequence that the conformal equiv-
alence class of a closed homogeneous timelike curve of type C2i is determined by a geo-
metrical invariant, the total strain, and two topological invariants of its directrices, the
Bennequin number and the linking number. In addition, the proposition shows that the
directrices of the homogeneous knots of the class C2i are representatives of the contact
isotopy classes of transversal torus knots of type (p, q) with maximal Bennequin number
