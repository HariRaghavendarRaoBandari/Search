We provide evidence that spin ferroquadrupolar (FQ) order is the likely ground state in the non-magnetic
nematic phase of stoichiometric FeSe. By studying the variational mean-ﬁeld phase diagram of a bilinear-
biquadratic Heisenberg model up to 2nd nearest neighbor, we ﬁnd FQ phase in close proximity to the columnar
antiferromagnet (CAFM) commonly realized in iron-based superconductors. The stability of FQ phase is further
veriﬁed by density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). The dynamical spin structure factor in the FQ state is
calculated with ﬂavor-wave theory, which yields qualitatively consistent result with inelastic neutron scattering
experiments (INS) on FeSe at both low and high energies. We verify that FQ can coexist with C4 breaking
environments in the mean-ﬁeld calculation, and further discuss the possibility that quantum ﬂuctuations in FQ
act as a source of nematicity.

Superconductivity in the iron-based superconductors [1, 2]
is widely recognized to have spin ﬂuctuations at its ori-
gin [3, 4], as it develops after the suppression of colum-
nar antiferromagnetism (CAFM) by doping or applied pres-
sure on the parent compounds [5–8]. The CAFM phase is
characterized by the magnetic Bragg peaks at wave-vectors
Q1,2
= (π, 0)/(0, π) in the one-iron Brillouin zone, seen ubiq-
uitously in different families of the iron pnictides and chalco-
genides [5, 9, 10]. The discovery of superconductivity in sto-
ichiometric FeSe thus came as a surprise, because the long-
range magnetic order is conspicuously absent in this ma-
terial [11–16]. Another important feature, universally ob-
served across different families of iron-based superconduc-
tors, is the appearance of an electronic nematic phase [17–20]
which spontaneously breaks the lattice C4 rotational symme-
try. Usually, nematicity appears in close proximity to mag-
netism above the N´eel temperature, however in FeSe, the ne-
matic phase appears without any accompanying magnetism
and coexists with superconductivity [12–15].
It is thus im-
portant to understand the origin of this non-magnetic nematic
phase, in particular to gain insight into its effect on supercon-
ductivity.

It turns out that magnetic order can be induced by applying
hydrostatic pressure to FeSe [12–14]. It has also been sug-
gested based on ab initio calculations that the non-magnetic
phase in FeSe lies in close proximity to the CAFM phase
[21–23]. Further evidence of proximity to long-range mag-
netic order comes from inelastic neutron scattering (INS) ex-
periments, which found large spectral weight at wavevectors
Q1,2 [24–27]. Two natural questions arise: In the theoreti-
cal phase diagram, is there a non-magnetic phase that neigh-
bors on the CAFM? And furthermore, how does such a non-
magnetic phase give rise to nematicity?

In an attempt to answer these questions, several theoretical
scenarios have been proposed for non-magnetic ground states
that may appear as a result of frustration: a nematic quantum
paramagnet [28], a spin quadrupolar state with wave-vectors
Q1,2 [29], or a staggered dimer state [30]. In all three cases, the
ground state wavefunction was designed to explicitly break
the C4 symmetry, thus resulting in nematicity. Alternatively,

instead of being the ground state property, nematicity can also
be induced as a result of anisotropic thermal [31, 32] or pos-
sibly quantum ﬂuctuations.

In this Letter, we investigate the frustrated bilinear-
biquadratic Heisenberg model used by many authors to model
iron pnictides and chalcogenides [28, 29, 33–35], and show
that the most likely non-magnetic state that agrees qualita-
tively with the INS data on FeSe is the spin ferroquadrupo-
lar (FQ) phase. By using variational mean-ﬁeld, ﬂavor-
wave expansion, and the density matrix renormalization group
(DMRG) calculations, we ﬁrmly establish that the FQ phase
is situated in close proximity to the CAFM state in the phase
diagram and is readily accessible in the realistic parameter
regime of the model. The experimentally observed onset of
magnetism in FeSe under applied pressure [12–14] is thus
interpreted as the transition between the proposed FQ phase
and CAFM. The calculated dynamical spin structure factors
agree qualitatively with the INS data [24–27], exhibiting pro-
nounced maxima of the scattering intensity at the gapped Q1,2
points. We note that this is in contrast with the antiferro-
quadrupolar (AFQ) scenario, which has negligible spectral
weight at these wavevectors [29]. Furthermore, we demon-
strate that FQ order is robust with respect to C4 symme-
try breaking environment, and can thus support nematicity,
regardless of its microscopic origin. Additionally, we ﬁnd
that the density-density interactions between Q1,2 modes are
highly repulsive within the FQ phase and diverge upon ap-
proaching the FQ/CAFM phase boundary, providing a sce-
nario in which quantum ﬂuctuations in FQ are the origin of
nematicity.

We use a bilinear-biquadratic Heisenberg model [28, 29,
33–35] to investigate the ground state properties and spin dy-
namics:

Given a spin state parametrized by director (cid:126)di, the energy of

level by decoupling (cid:104)Si·S j(cid:105) ≈ (cid:104)Si(cid:105)·(cid:104)S j(cid:105) and similarly for (cid:104)Qi·

where N stands for the total number of lattice sites.

We then perform a variational search by minimizing Eq. (4)
with respect to (cid:126)di, where the directors (cid:126)di are restricted on
2 × 2 and 4 × 4 unit cells with periodic boundary condi-
tion. The purely quadrupolar states are identiﬁed with van-
ishing magnetic moment: (cid:104)Si(cid:105) ≡ 2 Re[(cid:126)di] × Im[(cid:126)di] = 0,∀i.
Among the quadrupolar states, one distinguishes a FQ phase,
with all directors parallel, and more general AFQ phases with
non-collinear directors. The familiar magnetic phases corre-
sponds to dipolar moment |(cid:104)Si(cid:105)| = 1,∀i with a spin struc-
ture factor characterized by the Bragg peaks. In general, one
also encounters states that contain a mixture of magnetic and
quadrupolar moments with 0 < |(cid:104)Si(cid:105)| < 1 on all sites, or
states which have purely magnetic/quadrupolar moments only
on partial sites, or even so-called semi-ordered states with un-
determined |(cid:104)Si(cid:105)| [36].
The variational mean-ﬁeld phase diagram is given in Fig. 1,
obtained for antiferromagnetic J1 > 0 and J2/J1 = 0.8, which
were deduced by ﬁtting the INS spectra for BaFe2As2 [37] to
the J1 − J2 − K1 spin model [34, 35]. Due to the fact that FeSe
lies in proximity to CAFM, we do not expect its parameters
to deviate dramatically from those deduced in Refs. [34, 35],
and we have also veriﬁed that the magnetic and quadrupolar
phases in Fig. 1 are robust to small variations of J2/J1. Re-
markably, Fig. 1 shows that the only non-magnetic phase in
close proximity to CAFM is the FQ phase, with both phases
realized at negative biquadratic interaction K1. We note that

K1 < 0 is generically expected from the ﬁtting of the INS
spectra in the iron pnictides/chalcogenides [34, 35], with the
ratio |K1|/J1 of order 1. This is indeed consistent with the lo-
cation of CAFM region in Fig. 1. No other purely quadrupolar
phases were found; in particular the AFQ(π, 0)/(0, π) phase,
expected to be realized for positive K2 [29] turns out to be un-
stable to the admixture of the magnetic moment, resulting in
a mixed magnetic/quadrupolar state with 0 < |(cid:104)Si(cid:105)| < 1 (grey
region in Fig. 1) [38].
Since the variational mean-ﬁeld calculation only takes into
account minimally entangled mean-ﬁeld states, the results in
Fig. 1 may be energetically unfavorable upon quantum ﬂuc-
tuations. To verify the stability of the FQ phase, we have
performed the SU(2) DMRG calculations [39–42] on L×2L
rectangular cylinders with L = (4, 6, 8) [43] near the mean-
ﬁeld FQ/CAFM phase boundary. We keep up to 4000 SU(2)
states, leading to truncation errors less than 2× 10−5 in all
data points presented in this Letter. In Fig. 2, we show both

S (0, π) is suppressed from L = 4 to
8, and vanishes in the thermodynamic limit by extrapolation;
while m2
Q(0, 0) remains ﬁnite, conﬁrming FQ as the underly-
ing phase. For small negative K1, m2
S (0, π) remains ﬁnite in the
thermodynamic limit, conﬁrming the corresponding phase to
be CAFM. We note that the DMRG yields a larger FQ region

Having established FQ as a stable non-magnetic phase in
close proximity to CAFM, we turn to the analysis of its mag-
netic exictations. We use the ﬂavor-wave technique, which
represents the local spin and quadrupolar operators Oi in terms
of three ﬂavors of Schwinger bosons in the fundamental repre-

corresponds to the Bose-Einstein condensation of the appro-
priate boson (labeled bz), and the remaining two ﬂavors cap-
ture both spin and quadrupolar excitations [36, 47, 48]. Ex-
panding b†i,z

where dispersion ωq,a are degenerate in ﬂavor index a = {x, y},
shown in Fig. 3(a). Since FQ phase spontaneously breaks
the spin-rotational symmetry, there are two gapless Goldstone
modes at q = 0. However there is no Bragg peak as the dy-
namical spin structure factor S (q, ω) shown in Fig. 3(b) has
a vanishing spectral weight (∝ |q|) at q = 0, ω = 0 because
of the conservation of time reversal symmetry in quadrupo-
lar states [47, 48, 50, 51]. In Fig. 3(b), we see large spectral
weight at Q1,2 at low energy due to the proximity to the CAFM
phase. The spectral weight further shifts towards (π, π) when
increasing ω (see Fig. 3(c-f)), closely tracking the INS results
on FeSe [24–27]. We note that in the AFQ (π, 0)/(0, π) phase
proposed in Ref. 29, one would expect Goldstone modes with
zero spectral weight at Q1,2, which would contradict the large-
intensity dispersing feature near Q1,2 found in the INS data on

FeSe.

Having demonstrated that FQ phase is indeed consistent
with the INS results on FeSe [24–27], we now ask further
whether FQ phase can coexist with nematicity observed in
FeSe. We apply C4 breaking exchange anisotropy in Eq. (1),
using Jx,y
= (1 ± 0.2)J1 in the variational mean-ﬁeld calcula-
1
tion. This results in the shift of the phase boundaries (shown
with dashed lines in Fig. 1) and although the FQ phase shrinks
slightly, it clearly remains stable in a large portion of the
mean-ﬁeld phase diagram.

We now turn to the microscopic origin of nematicity in
FeSe – can FQ order be the reason for the discrete C4 sym-
metry breaking? Unlike other proposals starting with nematic
spin wavefunctions in the ground state [28–30], in the ﬂavor
wave theory up to bilinear terms in Eq. (5), the spin corre-
lations in FQ phase are C4 symmetric. This does not mean
that the FQ ground state cannot spontaneously break this sym-
metry and in fact, it turns out that higher order interactions
(mode-mode coupling) become increasingly important when
approaching the FQ/CAFM phase boundary. Collecting up to
the 4th order terms in the ﬂavor wave theory [38], we obtain

factor, which should exhibit Bragg peaks at the ordering wave-
vector, and in principle can be measured by resonant inelastic
X-ray scattering experiments [52].

In summary, we showed that FQ phase lies in close prox-
imity to CAFM in the phase diagram of a bilinear biquadratic
spin-1 model and that it is stable in a realistic range of the
model parameters, as veriﬁed by both the mean-ﬁeld and
DMRG methods. The dynamical spin structure factor S (q, ω)
inside the FQ phase is shown to be qualitatively consistent
with the recent INS results on FeSe. While at the quadratic
level the FQ ground state does not explicitly break the C4 lat-
tice symmetry, we demonstrate that the quantum ﬂuctuations
result in repulsive density-density interactions between Q1,2
magnon modes, whose strength diverges on approaching the
FQ/CAFM phase boundary. This suggests the existence of a
ﬁnite window inside the non-magnetic FQ phase where the
C4 symmetry is spontaneously broken. Further studies are
necessary to establish such nematic window unequivocally,
however, even if the nematicity is driven by other sources (for
example, local strains due to lattice imperfections; or orbital
ordering, as proposed in the light of recent nuclear magnetic
resonance [53, 54] and ARPES [55] experiments), the incipi-
ent nematic order will couple to the symmetry-breaking quan-
tum ﬂuctuations that we found in the FQ phase. Our calcula-
tions show that the FQ order is robust with respect to such C4
breaking environments and can coexist with nematicity.

at momentum q. If we stop at the quadratic level of ﬂavor
wave theory, then (cid:104)∆(cid:105)fw ≡ 0 due to the Bose-Einstein con-
densation at q = (0, 0). Once interactions are taken into ac-
count in H4th, the condensate will become depleted, resulting
in a ﬁnite boson density at the local minima Q1,2 of the spec-
trum in Fig. 3(a) and thus making it possible, in principle, that
(cid:104)∆(cid:105) (cid:44) 0. To see how this may occur, we consider the density-
density interactions between the Q1,2 modes, which can be
extracted from Eq. (6) as:

Hint = ˜V(nQ1,xnQ2,x + nQ1,ynQ2,y) + ˜V(cid:48)nQ1,xnQ2,y + . . . ,

are expressed [38] through Vcd

1 < K1 < Kc

The values of ˜V and ˜V(cid:48) are plotted in Fig. 4. Intriguingly,
they are repulsive in the region K1 > −3, and diverge when
approaching the FQ/CAFM phase boundary at Kc
= −1.6,
1
resulting in a C4 symmetry-breaking imbalance in boson oc-
(cid:44) nQ2. Since sufﬁciently strong (not necessarily
cupation nQ1
diverging) interactions can commonly trigger diverging sus-
ceptibilities, we expect the renormalized nematic susceptibil-
ity to diverge before reaching the FQ/CAFM phase boundary,
resulting in a ﬁnite nematic window KN
1 inside
the FQ phase. The existence of such a window should be
carefully veriﬁed by further analytical and numerical efforts,
which will be a subject of future work. We note that while
the present study is limited to second-neighbor interactions,
our mean-ﬁeld analysis shows that inclusion of third neighbor
K3(Si · S j)2 term with K3 < 0 will further favor FQ over mag-
netic phases [38], possibly leading to a wider nematic region.
Direct experimental measurements of quadrupolar orders
are typically difﬁcult, due to the negligible spectral weight
of the spin structure factor near the ordering wave-vector. A
possible way to visualize such “ghost” modes is by applying a
magnetic ﬁeld: the degeneracy of the two ﬂavors will be lifted,
and one of the Goldstone modes acquires a gap and a visible
spectral weight [50, 51], as we demonstrate in [38]. More

QUARTIC INTERACTIONS

In Eq. (7) in the main text, the density-density interactions

between Q1,2 are extracted from Eq. (6) as:

˜V = V xx
˜V(cid:48) = Vyx

xx (Q1, Q2, (0, 0)) + V xx
xy (Q1, Q2, (0, 0)),

xx (Q1, Q2, (π, π)),

(S13b)

where the intra-ﬂavor interactions are identical for x and y
ﬂavors.

For incoming momenta Q1, Q2 and exchange momenum
q = (0, 0) or q = (π, π), the interactions in Hint are shown in
Fig. S3. We note that all ﬁve types of the interactions are pos-
itively divergent at the FQ/CAFM phase boundary Kc
= −1.6.
