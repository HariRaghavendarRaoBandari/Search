Abstract
We investigate the nature of a Z2-invariant XY ring-exchange interaction with a frustrated Ising coupling on the triangular lattice.
In the limit of pure XY ring-exchange interaction, we show that the classical ground state is degenerate resulting from the Z2-
invariance of the Hamiltonian. Quantum ﬂuctuations lift these classical degenerate ground states and produce an unusual state
whose excitation spectrum exhibits a gapped maximum quadratic dispersion near k = 0 and vanishes at the midpoints of each side
of the Brillouin zone. This result is in contrast to a gapless quadratic dispersion near k = 0 in the U(1)-invariant counterpart. We
also study the eﬀects of frustration when competing with a classically frustrated Ising interaction. We provide a glimpse into the
possible quantum phases that could emerge. A comprehensive understanding of this Hamiltonian, however, cannot be elucidated
analytically and requires an explicit numerical simulation.

1. Introduction

The study of quantum spin ice (QSI) on three dimensional
(3D) pyrochlore lattice has attracted considerable attention [1–
13]. Huang-Chen-Hermele [1] have proposed an alternative
Hamiltonian for QSI in 3D pyrochlore lattice, applicable to cer-
tain class of d- and f -electron systems with dipolar-octupolar
Kramers doublets. Using dimensional reduction [10–12], Car-
rasquilla et al., [2] have recently mapped this model to 2D
kagome lattice with a [111] crystallographic ﬁeld. They have
identiﬁed the interaction that promotes a putative quantum spin
liquid (QSL) state and uncovered the low-temperature quantum
phase diagram using a non-perturbative, unbiased QMC simu-
lations on the kagome lattice [2]. In this system, competition
between the classical Ising frustration and a Z2-invariant fer-
romagnetic quantum ﬂuctuation lead to a putative QSL state.
Thus, there is a possibility to search for 2D QSL states within a
class of pyrochlore quantum spin ice materials. The distinctive
feature of the QSI Hamiltonian is the presence of Z2 symmetry.
We have recently studied the 2D quantum kagome ice Hamil-
tonian of Carrasquilla et al., [2] on the triangular lattice [14],
using spin wave theory. An explicit numerical simulation has
not been reported at the moment. However, spin wave theory
still captures the interesting properties of the system because
quantum ﬂuctuations are suppressed in this model. In principle,
there is a possibility of a ring exchange interaction that exhibits
a Z2 symmetry, as in the U(1)-invariant XY model (hard-core
bosons) with ring-exchange interactions [15–26]. The ring ex-
change quantum spin Hamiltonian is believed to be very impor-
tant in Wigner crystals near the melting density [27–29]. They
also promote interesting quantum properties with rich quantum
phase diagram.

In this communication, we consider the competing interac-
tions between a classically frustrated Ising interaction and a Z2-
invariant ring exchange interaction. The Hamiltonian can be
written as

where S ±

operators respectively. A special feature of this Hamiltonian
is that it exhibits only Z2-symmetry in the x-y plane, i.e., π-
µ → S z
rotation about the z-axis in spin space, S ±
µ;
µ = i, j, k, l. The Hamiltonian (Eq. (1)) can be studied in any
lattice geometry. However, for bipartite lattices, Eq. (1) is re-
lated to a U(1)-invariant model by a π-rotation about the x-
axis on two sublattices, i.e., S ±
i, j. We
restrict our analyses to the triangular lattice. Hence, the sum-
mation over the ring exchange term runs over the three possi-
ble four-spin plaquette orientations on a triangular lattice; see
Fig. (1). We will investigate the distinctive features of the pure
Z2-invariant XY ring-exchange Hamiltonian (Jz = 0) and its ef-
fects when competing with a classical Ising frustration (Jz < K,
with K < 0). The study of this Hamiltonian is partially moti-
vated by the quantum phases uncovered in 2D QSI Hamiltonian
[2] and the recent study of the 2D QSI Hamiltonian on the tri-
angular lattice [14].

2. Pure-K model

In order to get an insight into the eﬀects of Z2 symmetry of
Eq. (1), we consider the pure-K model in Eq. (1), which corre-
sponds to Jz = 0. In this limit, the resulting Hamiltonian has
a related U(1)-invariant counterpart [18, 19]. The important
feature of the U(1)-invariant pure-K model is that the energy
spectra has a gapless quadratic excitation near k = 0 [18–20].

However, the present model is devoid of continuous symme-
tries. The behaviour of the excitation spectra is not known in
literatures. It is interesting to investigate how the excitations
behave in the long wavelength limit. The Hamiltonian, Eq. (1),
in this limit (Jz = 0) can be written explicitly as

Classically, the ground state of Eq. (2) is highly degenerate
resulting from the Z2 symmetry of the Hamiltonian. The ground
state corresponds to all possible spin conﬁgurations along the
basis eα and eβ (see Fig. (1)), and it is independent of the sign
of K. There are several ways to investigate how quantum ﬂuctu-
ations select a particular classical ground state in this system. In
the U(1)-invariant model, this can be done by integrating out the
phase ﬂuctuations about the classical ground state in the path
integral for the partition function [18]. This method, however,
is eﬀectively the same as performing spin wave theory about
any classical ground state of Eq. (2). The collective excitation
spectrum is the same in both methods.

Since we have only x-y coupling in Eq. (2), one can show
that the excitation spectrum about any classical ground state is
the same, provided one rotates the axes properly. In the present
model there is no conserved quantity, it is expedient to use a
direct spin wave theory via the Holstein Primakoﬀ transform
[30]. We choose the easy-axis ferromagnetic state, and imple-
ment the linearized Holstein Primakoﬀ transformation, [30, 31]

In Fig. (2) we have shown the spin wave spectrum of the
U(1)-invariant model obtained in Ref. [18] using a diﬀerent ap-
proach.
In this case, there is one quadratic gapless mode at
k = 0. In contrast, Fig. (3) shows the spin wave spectrum for
the present model. We observe instabilities of the spin wave at
the midpoints of the adjacent sides of the Brillouin zone, that
is at the points A, B, and C in Fig. (4). At the center of the
Brillouin zone the spectrum exhibits a gapped maximum dis-
persion, which in the long wavelength limit behaves as

E(k) = a − b|k|2,

The distinguishing feature of the density of states is that the
largest peak correspond to the saddle point of the excitation en-
ergy. The maximum excitation energy, however, is at much
higher energy and leads to a step-like van Hove singularity.
The density of states also shows a discontinuity correspond-
ing to the vanishing of the excitation spectrum at the midpoints
of adjacent sides of the Brillouin zone in Fig. (3). Thus, the
Z2-invariant pure-K model describes an unusual liquid.

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

We now consider the full model in Eq. (1). In the regime
Jz (cid:28) K, the physics of this Hamiltonian is, in fact, the same
as in the previous section.
In the dominant Ising coupling,
Jz > K, the sign of K is very crucial and the system is frus-
trated as it is impossible to align the spins antiferromagnet-
ically on the vertices of the triangular lattice. This leads to
many classical degenerate ground states. The classical degen-
erate ground states of the pure-Jz term are known to be lifted
through order-by-disorder mechanism [14] by quantum ﬂuc-
tuations emanating from the pure XY easy-axis ferromagnetic
. In this case, quantum
ﬂuctuations select a particular state known as a ferrosolid state
[14]. This state diﬀers from the conventional supersolid state,
[25] as it breaks translational and Z2 symmetries.

We can imagine covering the triangular lattice with plaque-
ttes, then one of the degenerate classical ground states of Eq. (1)
obeys the ice-rules depicted in Fig. (6), in which the Ising term
represents the degenerate classical ice and the ring exchange
term denotes quantum ﬂuctuations. However, the lifting of the
classical degeneracy by the ring exchange term is a highly non-
trivial mathematical problem. In fact, it is infeasible to analyze

this problem analytically. For Jz > K and K < 0, there is a
possibility of a gapped QSL state with gapped excitations on
frustrated non-bipartite lattices. Although we cannot analyti-
cally conﬁrm this claim, numerical techniques such as QMC
should be tractable with K < 0. It would be interesting to inves-
tigate numerically if Eq. (1) promotes a two-dimensional QSL
state within a class of triangular lattice QSL materials, [32–34]
and other QSL materials on the kagome [35] and pyrochlore
lattices [1–10, 13]. A related U(1)-invariant easy-axis model
on the kagome lattice has been conjectured to possess a QSL
phase [36].

4. Conclusion

In this communication, we presented the distinctive features
of a Z2-invariant XY ring exchange interaction on the triangu-
lar lattice. We showed that the complete breaking of continu-
ous U(1) symmetry down to discrete Z2 symmetry has profound
eﬀects on the nature of the quantum properties that emerge
from this system. For the pure ring-exchange model with
Z2-invariance, we showed that the distinguishing factor is the
gapped k = 0 mode and soft modes at the midpoints of each
side of the Brillouin zone. As a result, the Z2-invariant ring
exchange model possesses some special features which are dif-
ferent from its U(1)-invariant counterpart. We also provided a
glimpse into the nature of the possible quantum phase that could
emerge when competing with a classically frustrated Ising in-
teraction. An explicit numerical simulation is required to un-
cover the nature of the proposed Hamiltonian and the possibil-
ity of any two-dimensional QSL states within a class of trian-
gular lattice QSL materials such as κ-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu2(CN)3
and EtMe3Sb[Pd(dmit)2]2 [32–35].
