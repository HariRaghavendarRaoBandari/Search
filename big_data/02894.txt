ABSTRACT

We report the discovery of two transiting extrasolar planets from the HATSouth survey. HATS-11,
a V=14.1 G0-star shows a periodic 12.9 mmag dip in its light curve every 3.6192 days and a radial
velocity variation consistent with a Keplerian orbit. HATS-11 has a mass of 1.000 ± 0.060 M⊙, a
radius of 1.444 ± 0.057 R⊙ and an eﬀective temperature of 6060 ± 150 K, while its companion is a
0.85 ± 0.12 MJ, 1.510 ± 0.078 RJ planet in a circular orbit. HATS-12 shows a periodic 5.1 mmag ﬂux
decrease every 3.1428 days and Keplerian RV variations around a V=12.8 F-star. HATS-12 has a
mass of 1.489 ± 0.071 M⊙, a radius of 2.21 ± 0.21 R⊙ and an eﬀective temperature of 6408 ± 75 K.
For HATS-12b, our measurements indicate that this is a 2.38 ± 0.11 MJ, 1.35 ± 0.17 RJ planet in a
circular orbit. Both host stars show sub-solar metallicity of −0.390±0.060 dex and −0.100±0.040 dex,
respectively and are (slightly) evolved stars. In fact, HATS-11 is amongst the most metal-poor and,
HATS-12 is amongst the most evolved stars hosting a hot Jupiter planet. Importantly, HATS-11 and
HATS-12 have been observed in long cadence by Kepler as part of K2 campaign 7 (EPIC216414930
and EPIC218131080 respectively).

1. INTRODUCTION

Transiting Extrasolar Planets, hereafter TEPs, allow
us to measure many of their physical properties that are
not accessible for non-transiting systems and thus occupy
a prominent place among the nearly two thousands of
exoplanets currently known.

One of the most important features of TEPs is that
their radii can be measured from the transit shape if the
radii of the stellar hosts are known. The radius, coupled

with the measurement of the planetary mass from radial
velocity (RV) observations, allows the computation of the
bulk density of the planet and the possibility of inferring
properties about its internal structure and composition.
The detection of close-in extrasolar giant planets has
led to several theoretical challenges regarding their struc-
ture, formation, and subsequent evolution. One of the
earliest realized challenges, and one which is yet to
be solved, is the fact that close-in giant exoplanets of-
ten show radii that are far larger than those predicted
by theories of giant planet evolution (e.g. HAT-P-32b
Hartman et al. 2011). Moving forward in understanding
the inﬂation mechanism will beneﬁt from having larger
samples of close-in, inﬂated gas giants, especially sys-
tems lying at some extreme of either planetary or stellar
properties.

One of the most basic properties one can mea-
sure of a star is its metallicity, and much atten-
tion in the past has been given to the dependence
of planet occurrence rate on the host star metallic-
ity.
Several studies have found that gas giants ap-
pear more frequently around metal-rich stars, both
from RV programs (Santos et al. 2004; Valenti & Fischer
2005; Johnson et al. 2010) and from Kepler data
(Schlaufman & Laughlin 2011; Buchhave et al. 2012;
Everett et al. 2013; Wang & Fischer 2015). Discoveries
of gas giants around metal-poor stars then add systems
to a region of parameter space that is intrinsically less
populated.

In this work we present two new inﬂated hot Jupiters
orbiting metal poor stars discovered by the HATSouth
survey: HATS-11b and HATS-12b. The structure of the
paper is as follows. In Section 2 we summarize the detec-
tion of the photometric transit signal and the subsequent

spectroscopic and photometric observations of each star
to conﬁrm the planets. In Section 3 we analyze the data
to rule out false positive scenarios and characterize the
star and planet. In Section 4 we put our new systems in
the context of the sample of the well characterized TEPs
known to date.

2. OBSERVATIONS

2.1. Photometric detection

The initial

images of HATS-11 and HATS-12 were
obtained with the HATSouth wide-ﬁeld telescope net-
work consisting of 24 Takahashi E180 astrographs with
an aperture of 18cm. The photons were detected
with Apogee 4k × 4k U16M ALTA CCDs. Details
on the time span and number of images are shown
in Table 1.
These images were processed follow-
ing Penev et al. (2013). The light curves were trend-
ﬁltered following Kov´acs et al. (2005) and searched
for periodic box-shaped signals using the Box Least-
Squares (Kov´acs et al. 2002) method. For HATS-11
(2MASS 19173618-2223236; α = 19h17m36.24s, δ =
−22◦23′23.7′′; J2000; V=14.018 ± 0.081) the discovery
light curve showed a photometric precision between 10
and 14 mmag per point and the BLS algorithm de-
tected a dip of 12.9 mmag every 3.6192 days. For the
brighter HATS-12 star (2MASS 19164857-1921212; α =
19h16m48.72s, δ = −19◦21′21.2′′; J2000; V=12.756 ±
0.021) the precision was between 6 and 7 mmag per
point and a periodic ﬂux decrease of 5.1 mmag with
P =3.1428 days was found, making this the third shal-
lowest ground-based discovery to date (after HAT-P-11
(Bakos et al. 2010) and WASP-73 (Delrez et al. 2014)).
Both light curves are shown in Figure 1 and the numer-
ical data is available in Table 3. These initial detections
triggered further spectroscopic and photometric follow-
up observations in order to conﬁrm the transit and the
planetary nature as explained in the following sections.

2.2. Spectroscopic Observations

We started observing both candidates spectroscopi-
cally, in a process which is split into two kinds of spectro-
scopic observations. A ﬁrst step of reconnaissance spec-
troscopy serves to reject possible astrophysical false posi-
tives, like e.g. binary stars, and to obtain a ﬁrst estimate
of stellar parameters. Afterwards, stable and high preci-
sion spectroscopic measurements allow us to obtain high
precision radial velocity (RV) and line bisector (BS) time
series for the stars. From this we can estimate the orbital
parameters as well as the presence and mass of the com-
panion for systems that are conﬁrmed as planets, and a
precise set of stellar parameters. The spectroscopic ob-
servations are summarized in Table 2.

HATS-11 was observed ﬁrst with the ANU 2.3m tele-
scope using the WiFES spectrograph and the duPont 2.5
m telescope using the echelle spectrograph. Details on
the observing strategy and data reduction for the ANU
2.3m can be found in Bayliss et al. (2013) and for the
duPont in Brahm et al. (2015). From these spectra we
detect no RV variations greater than ∼2 km s−1 and
could determine the host star’s spectral type. We ver-
iﬁed with the new information that the transit is still
consistent with a planetary companion. In light of this,
we continued to observe HATS-11 with spectrographs al-

lowing for simultaneous wavelength calibration for RV
precision, namely with CORALIE at the Euler 1.2m and
FEROS at the MPG 2.2m telescope. For both spec-
trographs we made use of the reduction procedures de-
scribed in Jord´an et al. (2014) which gave us the RV and
BS measurements of the spectrum. Similarly, HATS-12
was observed with the WiFES and the duPont echelle
spectrograph. RVs/BSs were obtained with FEROS and
additionally with the HDS spectrograph at the Subaru
telescope. Details on the data reduction with HDS can
be found in Sato et al. (2002, 2012). The phased high-
precision RV and BS measurements are shown for each
system in Figure 2; the data are presented in Table 6.
Spectra, RVs and BSs are used in Section 3 to reject
some possible systems mimicking a planetary system.

2.3. Photometric follow-up observations

We also photometrically followed-up both candidates
with larger aperture telescopes. This is necessary be-
cause the HATSouth survey telescopes have limited pho-
tometric precision whereas the light curves obtained with
these follow-up telescopes are of higher quality allowing
us to better characterize the system. The distant in time
photometric follow-up observations further help us to re-
ﬁne the transit ephemeris. Photometric follow-up obser-
vations are summarized in Table 1. The data are given
in Table 3. The light curves for HATS-11 are shown in
Figure 3 while for HATS-12 they are shown in Figure 4.
We obtained photometric time series of HATS-11
with the PEST 0.3 m, Swope 1 m, and the LCOGT
1 m networks. Data reduction followed the established
procedures described in previous HATSouth discover-
ies (Penev et al. (2013); Mohler-Fischer et al. (2013);
Bayliss et al. (2013); Jord´an et al. (2014); Zhou et al.
(2014b); Hartman et al. (2015); Brahm et al. (2015);
Mancini et al. (2015)).

Additionally, a partial transit of HATS-11b was ob-
served on 2014-09-07, in the Ks-band, using the IRIS2
infrared camera (Tinney et al. 2004) on the 3.9 m Anglo
Australian Telescope, at Siding Spring Observatory, Aus-
tralia. The instrument uses a Hawaii 1-RG detector, has
a ﬁeld of view of 7.7′ × 7.7′, pixel scale of 0.4486′′pixel−1.
Exposures were 15 s in duration, with a total of 931 ex-
posures taken, lasting a total of 4.6 hours. The target
remained above airmass 1.25, and drifted by less than
1 pixel throughout the observations. The telescope was
defocused to achieve a PSF FWHM of ∼2.2′′, in order
to minimize the eﬀect of inter- and intra-pixel variation,
and prevent saturation. The observing strategy, data re-
duction, and light curve analysis techniques are detailed
in Zhou et al. (2014a). Flat ﬁelding is performed using
a linear combination of two sets of dither frames taken
before and after the observation. Aperture photometry
is performed on each frame to extract the ﬂuxes of the
target and reference stars. The target light curve was
corrected against the ensemble of reference stars, with
weights to each reference star ﬁtted for to minimize the
out-of-transit root mean square (RMS) scatter of the
target star.

All observations of HATS-11b in diﬀerent ﬁlters re-
produced a similar ﬂux decrease of 12.9 mmag as seen
in the discovery light curve, but with a higher pre-
cision, between 1.6 and 5 mmag per point. We
note that mostly partial transits were observed. Each

b For the CORALIE and FEROS observations of HATS-11, and for the FEROS observations of HATS-12, this is the zero-point RV from the best-ﬁt
orbit. For the WiFeS and du Pont Echelle it is the mean of the observations. We do not provide this quantity for HDS for which only relative RVs
are measured, or for the lower resolution WiFeS observations which were only used to measure stellar atmospheric parameters.
c For High-precision RV observations included in the orbit determination this is the scatter in the RV residuals from the best-ﬁt orbit (which
may include astrophysical jitter), for other instruments this is either an estimate of the precision (not including jitter), or the measured standard
deviation. We do not provide this quantity for low-resolution observations from the ANU 2.3 m/WiFeS or for I2-free observations made with HDS,
as RVs are not measured from these data.

light curve allowed us to reﬁne and improve the
uncertainties of the ephemeris, which helped us to
schedule subsequent transit observations. The ﬁnal
ephemeris is determined through the global MCMC anal-
ysis, as explained in Section 3.3, founding them to be
Tc(BJD) = 2456574.9657 ± 0.0013 and P = 3.6191613 ±
0.0000099 days, as well as the parameters Rp/R⋆ =
0.1076 ± 0.0028 and b2 = 0.041+0.060
−0.029.

HATS-12 was observed with the PEST 0.3 m,
MPG 2.2 m, DK 1.54 m and the Swope 1 m telescopes.
Again, their light curves were consistent with the dis-
covery observations. For data analysis of the PEST,
Swope and MPG2.2m observations we repeated our
well established procedures as described in previous pa-
pers (Penev et al. (2013); Mohler-Fischer et al. (2013);
Bayliss et al. (2013); Jord´an et al. (2014); Zhou et al.
(2014b); Hartman et al. (2015); Brahm et al. (2015);
Mancini et al. (2015)). For the DK 1.54 m observation
on the night 2013-10-03, we defocused the telescope.
We used DFOSC, a focal reducer type camera with a

2048 × 4096 pixels E2V44-82 CCD. The CCD electron-
ics was improved with a 32-bit analog-digital-converter
(ADC), allowing for more levels than the usual 65536
available in 16-bit ADCs which are generally used for as-
tronomical CCDs. The saturation obtained with this in-
strument is up to around 700000 ADU s with higher read-
out speed (400 kpix/s) and higher gain of 0.24 [e−/ADU ],
and readout noise is 9.94 e−. However, only half of the
CCD is illuminated by the telescope and this part of the
CCD is readout and generally referred to as full frame,
while further windowing is generally possible. The ﬁeld-
of-view (FOV) of the illuminated part is 13.7′ × 13.7′.
This is suﬃciently large to ﬁnd adequate reference stars
for our diﬀerential photometry. We choose a reference
image and calculated the shift of all images with respect
to the reference image. From the reference image we ex-
tracted the position of the stars. Following Deeg & Doyle
(2013), the time series photometry was generated from
these observations using optimized aperture photometry
that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for each
star. For all images in one night we used three ﬁxed

apertures and choose these to be much larger than the
typical point spread function in order to minimize the
impact of the time-variable seeing. Depending on the
telescope, for this bright object we obtained a follow-
up precision between 0.7 and 3.4 mmag per point. The
subsequent reﬁnement of the transit ephemeris was es-
pecially important for HATS-12, as the ﬁrst photomet-
ric follow-up observation with the PEST 0.3 m, telescope
showed the ﬂat out-of-transit part. Despite that we did
not detect the transit with the our initial ephemeris,
this observation was still consistent with the transit hav-
ing occurred after the observation, see upper most light
curve in Figure 4. We updated the ephemeris so that
the following photometric observation with GROND ﬁ-
nally revealed the transit. Again, using the procedure
described in Section 3.3, the ﬁnal ephemeris was de-
termined to be Tc(BJD) = 2456798.9556 ± 0.0012 and
P = 3.142833 ± 0.000011 days, as well as the parameters

3. ANALYSIS

3.1. Properties of the parent star

In order to obtain the physical parameters of the newly
discovered planets, we have to characterize their stellar
hosts. We determined precise atmospheric parameters
for HATS-11 and HATS-12 from the median combined
FEROS spectra. The SNR of both combined spectra was
∼50 per resolution element. We applied the algorithm
ZASPE (Brahm et al. 2016, in prep) to both spectra
which determines Teﬀ , log g, [Fe/H] and v sin i via least
squares minimization against a grid of synthetic spectra
in the most sensitive regions of the wavelength cover-
age to changes in the atmospheric parameters. ZASPE
obtains reliable errors and correlations between the pa-
rameters that take into account the systematic mismatch
between the data and the optimal synthetic spectra.

The Teﬀ and [Fe/H] values from ZASPE were com-
bined with the stellar density (ρ⋆) which was obtained
through our joint light curve and RV curve analysis to
determine a ﬁrst estimation of the stellar physical param-
eters (Sozzetti et al. 2007). In particular we search for
the parameters of the Yonsei-Yale (Y2; Yi et al. 2001)
isochrones (stellar mass, radius and age) that produce
the best match with our estimated Teﬀ,
[Fe/H] and
ρ⋆values. Then we compute a new value for log g which is
held ﬁx in a second run of ZASPE and a subsequent com-
parison with the theoretical isochrones is made. The ﬁnal
adopted parameters for HATS-11 and HATS-12 are given
in Table 4. Figure 5 shows the locations of each star on
a Teﬀ⋆–ρ⋆ diagram. We found after performing the anal-
ysis just described that both stars are slightly evolved
metal poor stars. HATS-11 has a mass of 1.0±0.06 M⊙,
a radius of 1.444±0.057 R⊙ and an age of 7.7±2 Gyr,
while the parameters for HATS-12 are 1.489±0.071 M⊙,
2.21±0.21 R⊙ and an age of 2.36±0.3 Gyr. Distances are
determined by comparing the measured broad-band pho-
tometry listed in Table 4 to the predicted magnitudes in
each ﬁlter from the isochrones. We assume a RV = 3.1
extinction law from Cardelli et al. (1989) to determine
the extinction.

3.2. Excluding blend scenarios

In order to exclude blend scenarios we carried out an
analysis following Hartman et al. (2012). We attempt
to model the available photometric data (including light
curves and catalog broad-band photometric measure-
ments) for each object as a blend between an eclipsing
binary star system and a third star along the line of sight.
The physical properties of the stars are constrained us-
ing the Padova isochrones (Girardi et al. 2000), while we
also require that the brightest of the three stars in the
blend have atmospheric parameters consistent with those
measured with ZASPE.

For HATS-11 we ﬁnd that the best-ﬁt blend model
provides a poorer ﬁt to the data than the best-ﬁt
planet+star model, and can be rejected with 3σ conﬁ-
dence. Based on simulating composite spectra for the
blend models that we tested, we also ﬁnd that any
blended eclipsing binary system that can plausibly ﬁt
the photometric data (i.e. cannot be rejected with more
than 5σ conﬁdence) would show BS variations ranging
from 400 m s−1 for the model that provides the most
marginal ﬁt (i.e. at the 5σ rejection limit), to more than

1 km s−1 for the best-ﬁtting blend models, as well as hav-
ing RV variations with K > 200 m s−1. As the measured
BS variation is 80 m s−1 for FEROS and 140 m s−1 for
Coralie, and the RV semiamplitude is 112 ± 15 m s−1, we
conclude that HATS-11 is not a blended stellar eclipsing
binary system, and that the observations favor a transit-
ing planet system interpretation. Similarly, for HATS-12
we ﬁnd that the best-ﬁt blend model provides a poorer
ﬁt to the data than the best-ﬁt planet+star model, and
in this case can be rejected with 2σ conﬁdence. Those
blended eclipsing binary systems that cannot be rejected
with more than 5σ conﬁdence based solely on the pho-
tometry would have easily been detected as composite
systems based on the FEROS and HDS spectroscopy, and
would have BS variations exceeding 1 km s−1. For com-
parison, the BS RMS scatter is 34 m s−1 and 15 m s−1 for
the FEROS and HDS observations of HATS-12, respec-
tively. We conclude that HATS-12 is also not a blended
stellar eclipsing binary system, and is instead a tran-
siting planet system. However, both system could still
be diluted transiting planet systems, which cannot be
recognized by spectroscopic observations and only high
angular resolution imaging can solve. If a blended stellar
companion is present, diluting the light of the transiting
system, then the true companion radius could be up to
60% larger than inferred.

3.3. Global modeling of the data

We modeled the HATSouth photometry, the follow-
up photometry, and the high-precision RV measure-
ments following P´al et al. (2008), Bakos et al. (2010) and
Hartman et al. (2012). We ﬁt Mandel & Agol (2002)
transit models to the light curves, allowing for a dilu-
tion of the HATSouth transit depth as a result of blend-
ing from neighboring stars and over-correction by the
trend-ﬁltering method. For the follow-up light curves we
include a quadratic trend in time in our model for each
event to correct for remaining systematic errors in the
photometry. We ﬁt Keplerian orbits to the RV curves
allowing the zero-point for each instrument to vary inde-
pendently in the ﬁt, and allowing for RV jitter which we
also vary as a free parameter for each instrument. This
jitter may be astrophysical or instrumental in nature, and
simply represents excess scatter in the RV observations
beyond what is expected based on formal uncertainties.
We used a Diﬀerential Evolution Markov Chain Monte
Carlo procedure to explore the ﬁtness landscape and to
determine the posterior distribution of the parameters
(DEMCMC; ter Braak 2006). Note that we tried ﬁtting
both ﬁxed circular orbits and free-eccentricity models to
the data, and for both systems ﬁnd that the data are con-
sistent with a circular orbit. For both systems the ﬁxed
circular orbit model has a higher Bayesian evidence so we
adopt the parameters obtained assuming no eccentricity
for both objects. Furthermore, we see no structure or
drift within our uncertainties that could hint to any extra
component in the system. We also note that for HATS-11
the scatter in the CORALIE and FEROS RV residuals is
consistent with the uncertainties, so our modeling ﬁnds
jitter values of 0 for both instruments. Similarly, we ﬁnd
that a jitter value of 0 is preferred for the HDS observa-
tions of HATS-12. For these instruments we list the 95%
upper limit on the jitter in the Table 5. The resulting pa-
rameters for each system are listed in Table 5. HATS-11b

c The out-of-transit level has been subtracted. For observations made with the HATSouth instruments (identiﬁed by “HS” in the “Instrument”
column) these magnitudes have been corrected for trends using the EPD and TFA procedures applied prior to ﬁtting the transit model. This
procedure may lead to an artiﬁcial dilution in the transit depths. For HATS-11 the transit depth is 72% and 84% that of the true depth for the
G579.1 and G579.2 observations, respectively. For HATS-12 it is 100% and 78% that of the true depth for the G579.4 and G580.1 observations,
respectively. For observations made with follow-up instruments (anything other than “HS” in the “Instrument” column), the magnitudes have been
corrected for a quadratic trend in time ﬁt simultaneously with the transit.

for both systems.
a Times are in Barycentric Julian Date calculated directly from UTC without correction for leap seconds. Tc: Reference epoch of mid transit that
minimizes the correlation with the orbital period. T12: total transit duration, time between ﬁrst to last contact; T12 = T34: ingress/egress time,
time between ﬁrst and second, or third and fourth contact.
b Reciprocal of the half duration of the transit used as a jump parameter in our MCMC analysis in place of a/R⋆. It is related to a/R⋆ by the
expression ζ/R⋆ = a/R⋆(2π(1 + e sin ω))/(P√1 − b2√1 − e2) (Bakos et al. 2010).

see e.g. Rabus et al. (2009b), or transit timing varia-
tions (TTVs) (Rabus et al. 2009a), such as were mea-
sured in the hot Jupiter WASP-47b (Becker et al. 2015).
The discovery of HATS-11b and HATS-12b thus provides
a strong motivation for a combination of both ground-
based detection and subsequent space-based follow-up
characterization that can be fruitful and eﬃcient.

4. DISCUSSION

In this paper we have presented HATS-11b and HATS-
12b, two inﬂated gas giants orbiting a metal-poor and a
subsolar metallicity star with [Fe/H] of −0.390 ± 0.060
and −0.100 ± 0.040, respectively. Globally ﬁtting all
observations we estimated precise system parameters as
shown in Tables 4-5.

HATS-11b and HATS-12b are two regular hot Jupiters
that present inﬂated radii as compared to predictions
of standard theoretical models of planetary structure.
However, a distinction of these transiting systems is that
both of them have low metallicity stellar hosts which are
evolved.

Figure 6 shows a histogram of metallicity for known
hot Jupiter planet hosts. The systems’ parameters were
taken from the Transiting Extrasolar Planet Catalogue
(TEPCat)1. We limited the sample to systems compara-
ble to our discovered planets in this work by restricting
it to TEPs satisfying MP ≥ 0.47MJ, 0.015 ≤ a ≤ 0.5
AU and around stars with 5300 K ≤ Teﬀ ≤ 7200 K
(stellar spectral type G to F). The choice of 0.47 MJ
for the minimum mass is made based on the ﬁndings of
Weiss et al. (2013) who found a break in the radius-mass
relation at that mass. We also restrict the sample to have
uncertainties in [Fe/H] ≤ 0.15 dex. As is now well es-
tablished, giant planets are found less frequently around
metal-poor stars. We note that HATS-11 is amongst the
most metal poor stars detected to harbor a transiting gi-
ant planet and thus has the value of populating a sparse
region of parameter space necessary to understand and
validate planet formation theories. In particular, plan-
ets as massive as HATS-11b around stars with such a low
metallicity can help to empirically constrain limits on the
metallicity of the nebulae in the context of core-accretion
theory, which can give insights of the boundaries of the
formation process (Matsuo et al. 2007).

In Figure 7 we show stellar surface gravity as func-
tion of stellar radius for the same sample as in Fig-
ure 6. HATS-11 is a slightly evolved metal-poor star.
Only two other systems resemble similar stellar param-
eters, namely HATS-9 (Brahm et al. 2015) and WASP-
48 (Enoch et al. 2011), but none of them is metal-poor.
Amongst the most evolved hot Jupiter hosts only two
have a low metal content, namely HATS-12 and Kepler-
435 (Almenara et al. 2015). No subsolar metallicity stars
with similar stellar radius and surface gravity to HATS-
12 have been detected so far, see Figure 7. Hence, HATS-
11b and HATS-12b add new systems to the population
of low-metallicity evolved stars known to host a giant
planet.

Finally, we note that HATS-11 and HATS-12 were se-
lected as targets for Kepler two-wheeled mission (K2)
Campaign 7 (EPIC216414930 and EPIC218131080 re-
spectively) under programs GO7066 and GO7067 (PI:
Bakos). These targets have now been observed, and data
is expected to be released on 2016 April 30. The high-
precision K2 data will allow us to improve their tran-
sit parameters, especially important for HATS-12, as it
shows the third shallowest ground-based transit discov-
ery to date. Furthermore, we will have the possibility to
search intensively for additional companions through the

HATS-11 and HATS-12, occupy a region where only few planet hosts are known. The inset graph in the corner shows the region around
HATS-12, with planet hosting stars of similar stellar radius, we note that HATS-12 is the only low metallicity system amongst the planet

Note. — Note that for the HDS iodine-free template exposures we do not measure the RV but do measure the BS. Such template exposures
can be distinguished by the missing RV value. The HDS observation of HATS-12 without a BS measurement has too low S/N in the I2-free blue
spectral region to pass our quality threshold for calculating accurate BS values.
a

The zero-point of these velocities is arbitrary. An overall oﬀset γrel ﬁtted independently to the velocities from each instrument has been

subtracted.
b
c

Internal errors excluding the component of astrophysical jitter considered in Section 3.3.

For FEROS and Coralie we take the BS uncertainty to be twice the RV uncertainty. For HDS the BS uncertainty is taken to be the standard

error on the mean of the BS values calculated for each of the ´Echelle orders.
