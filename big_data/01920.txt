We study the evolution of full jet shower in quark-gluon plasma via solving a set of coupled differential
transport equations for the three-dimensional momentum distributions of quarks and gluons contained in the
full jets. In our jet evolution equations, we include all partonic splitting processes as well as the collisional
energy loss and transverse momentum broadening for both the leading and radiated partons of the full jets.
Combining with a realistic (2+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic simulation for the space-time proﬁles of
the hot and dense nuclear medium produced in heavy-ion collisions, we apply our formalism to calculate the
nuclear modiﬁcation of single inclusive full jet spectra, the momentum imbalance of photon-jet and dijet pairs,
and jet shape function (at partonic level) in Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 ATeV. The roles of various jet-medium
interaction mechanisms on the full jet modiﬁcation are studied. We ﬁnd that the nuclear modiﬁcation of jet
shape is sensitive to the interplay of different interaction mechanisms as well as the energies of the full jets.

INTRODUCTION

Jet quenching is one of the main tools to study the proper-
ties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in the experi-
ments of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, such as those at the
Relativistic Heavy-ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) [1–3]. In heavy-ion collisions, the hard par-
tons produced at very early time pass through the surrounding
hot and dense QGP formed in these energetic collisions before
hadonizing into hadrons. During the propagation, the partonic
jet shower may experience elastic and inelastic scatterings
with the constituents of the medium. The interaction between
the hard jets and the soft medium usually reduce the energy of
the propagating jet partons, which leads to the suppression of
ﬁnal observed hadron and full jet yield at high transverse mo-
mentum, as compared to the binary-collision-scaled proton-
proton collisions. Such phenomenon is usually denoted as jet
quenching. In the last decades, there have been tremendous
theoretical/phenomenological studies [4–13] and experimen-
tal measurements [14–17] on the suppression of single inclu-
sive hadron spectra at high transverse momentum regime. In
recent years, the experimental reconstruction of full jets with

a given cone size deﬁned as R = p(∆φ)2 + (∆η)2 from

large ﬂuctuating background became available in relativistic
heavy-ion experiments [18–24], which has stimulated inten-
sive theoretical interest in the study of full jets and their nu-
clear modiﬁcation in high-energy nuclear collisions [25–45].
The study of full jets and their nuclear modiﬁcation in
heavy-ion collisions is quite different from single hadron
production, and is also expected to provide more detailed
information about jet-medium interaction. For jet quench-
ing study using single inclusive hadrons, the main focus is
the interaction of the leading partons with the medium con-
stituents. In this case, the radiative inelastic interaction with
the medium constituents is usually regarded as the main mech-
anism responsible for parton energy loss and the suppression
of light parton/hadron production in heavy-ion collisions [46–
48], while elastic collisions usually provides complementary

contribution for light ﬂavor jet quenching (We note that for
heavy ﬂavors, the collisional process become much more im-
portant due to ﬁnite mass effect, especially at low transverse
momentum regime [49, 50]). Full jets contain the informa-
tion of both the leading and subleading hadrons. Therefore,
in order to achieve a full understanding of the nuclear modi-
ﬁcation of full jets, one has to take into account the effect of
the medium on the full jet shower, i.e., the leading parton as
well as subleading partons. On one hand, since some of the
radiated partons can be still in the jet cone, the energy loss for
the leading parton is not the energy loss of the full jet. On
the other hand, the radiated shower partons in full jets may
interact with the constituents of the medium, and contribute
to the energy lose of the full jet [26]. Also, the interaction
of full jets with the medium may change the distribution of
the energy and momentum inside the jet cone, the study of
which may provide stringent test on our modeling jet-medium
interaction in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

In this work, we formulate a set of coupled differential
transport equations to calculate the evolution of the three-
dimensional momentum distributions of the shower partons
contained in the full jet during the propagation through the hot
and dense medium. Our evolution equations take into account
all the partonic splitting channels occurring in the inelastic
collision processes, as well as the collisinal energy loss and
transverse momentum broadening experienced by the shower
partons via elastic collisions with the medium constituents.
By turning on or off the corresponding terms in the evolution
equations, we can study the effects of different jet-medium
interaction mechanisms on the propagation and moﬁcation of
full jet shower. We keep track of both the energies and the
transverse momenta of all shower partons in the full jet during
the evolution, thus the medium modiﬁcation of full jet energy
as well as jet internal structure due to jet-medium interaction
can be studied straightforwardly.

The article is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce
our framework for calculating the evolution of the shower par-
tons’ three-dimensional momentum distributions in the full

jets during the propagation through the hot and dense medium.
In Sec. III, we solve the coupled differential transport equa-
tions on the background QGP medium produced in Pb+Pb
collisions at 2.76 ATeV, and present our results for various full
jet observables, including the suppression of single inclusive
jet spectra, the momentum imbalance of photon-jet and dijet
pairs, and the modiﬁcation of jet shape function. In Sec. IV,
we investigate the effects of different jet-medium interaction
mechanisms on the energy loss of full jets and on the nuclear
modiﬁcation of jet shape function. The summary is given in
Sec. V.

II. FRAMEWORK FOR FULL JET SHOWER EVOLUTION

IN MEDIUM

i⊥) = dNi(ωi, k2

In our approach, we foucs on the energy and transverse mo-
mentum distributions of the shower partons inside the full jet,
i⊥, with ωi the parton i’s
fi(ωi, k2
energy and ki⊥ its transverse momentum with respect to the
jet axis. This three-dimensional momentum distribution con-
tain much information about how the energy and momentum
are distributed within the full jet. In particular, we calculate
the total energy of the full jet with a given cone size R as
follows:

Ejet(R) =Xi ZR

i⊥)dωidk2

i⊥,

(1)

where the subscript R means that the integral is taken with
the constraint, ki⊥ < ωiR. To study the medium effect on the
propagation and the modiﬁcation of the full jet shower, we
solve a set of coupled-differential transport equations for the
j⊥, t). The transport
three-dimensional distribution fj(ωj, k2
equations have the following generic form:

In the above equation, the ﬁrst and second terms on the
right hand side account for the contributions from the colli-
sional energy loss and transverse momentum broadening ex-
perienced by the shower partons during the interaction with
medium constituents via binary elastic collisions. The sizes
of these two contributions are controlled by two transport co-
efﬁcients, the longitudinal momentum loss rate ˆe = dhEi/dt,
and the exchange rate of transverse momentum squared ˆq =
⊥i/dt [51–53]. The remaining terms are the contribu-
dh∆p2
tions from various inelastic processes. The second line is the
gain term, accounting for the radiation of parton j with the
energy ωj and the transverse momentum kj⊥ from the parton
i with the energy ωi and the transverse momentum ki⊥. The
third line is the loss term, representing the contribution from

2

the radiation of parton i from parton j. We note that for the
radiation process i → j, it contributes not only to the gain
term for the distribution fj(ωj, k2
j⊥), but also to the loss term
for the distribution fi(ωi, k2
i⊥). Our current framework is an
extension of the approach used by one of the authors in Ref.
[26], but contains several improvements. For the contribution
from the inelastic processes, we include the gluon radiation
as well as g → q ¯q channel. Also in Ref. [26] the radiative
contribution is only considered for the leading parton in the
jet, while in the current work we take into account the effect
that the radiated partons can also experience inelastic colli-
sions with the medium consituents after they are formed. Our
transport equation is similar to that used in Ref. [47, 54], but
we now apply to the shower partons contained in the full jets
and keep track of their energies as well as their transverse mo-
menta during the evolution through the hot and dense nuclear
medium.

To solve the above differential equation, the splitting rates
must be supplied. In this work, we use results from higher-
twist energy loss formalisms[55, 56] in which the medium-
induced gluon radiation spectrum takes the following form:

In the above equation, P (x = ω/E) is the vacuum split-
ting function for a given process, with ω the energy of the
radiated parton and E the energy of the parent parton, and
ˆqg is the gluon transverse momentum broadening rate, τf =
⊥ denotes the formation time for the radiation,
2Ex(1 − x)/k2
with k⊥ the transverse momentum of the radiated parton with
respect to the propagation direction of the parent parton, and
ti is the production time of the parent parton. To apply the
above radiation spectrum to the jet evolution equation, one
has to calculate the relative transverse momenta in the radia-
tion process i → j, where the parton i carries energy ωi and
the transverse momentum ki⊥, and the parton j carries the
energy ωj and the transverse momentum kj⊥, i.e.,

geometry for a parton i (within a jet) radiating another parton
j. The angles of the parton i and the parton j with repect to
the jet axis (i.e., z direction in the ﬁgure) are denoted as θi and
θj, and the relative angle between the parton i and the parton
j is denoted as θij.

From Fig. 1, we can write down the following geometric

relation between different transvese momenta and angles:

In our current study, we consider the three-dimensional mo-

The transport coefﬁcients for quarks and gluons are related by
a color factor: ˆqg/ˆqq = CA/CF = ˆeq/ˆeq.

In order to solve the above coupled differential equations,
Eq. (8) and Eq. (9), the initial conditions, i.e., the three-
dimensional momentum distributions of the quarks (plus anti-
quarks) and gluons before entering the medium, must be pro-
vided. We generate the initial conditions using PYTHIA sim-
ulation [57]. The parameters in PYTHIA have been tuned
such that jet shape function in p+p collisions at 2.76 TeV at
the LHC [23] can be described, as shown in Fig. 2 (see Sec. III
for the deﬁnition of jet shape function and more discussions).
The effect of the medium on the transport of the full jet, in
terms of the three-dimensional momentum distributions of the
shower partons, can be investigated using the above coupled
evolution equations. As has been mentioned, we include the
efffect that the shower partons can also experienced inelastic
radiative processes after they are formed. This is implemented
in our calculation by a restriction that the medium-induced ra-
diation at time t is only allowed for the shower partons with
the formation time τf < t. We also impose a minimum cut-
off ωmin GeV for the radiation (set as 2 GeV in our current
calculation) to take into account the balance effect from the
medium-induced absorption. The same cutoff energy is used
for the shower partons during their evolution assuming that
the patrons with energy lower than ωmin are thermalized and
then treated as a part of the medium.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS FOR VARIOUS FULL JET

OBSERVABLES

In this section, we present our numerical results for the nu-
clear modiﬁcations of various full jet observables in Pb+Pb
collisions at 2.76 ATeV at the LHC, including the nuclear
modiﬁcation factor for single inclusive jet spectra, the mo-
mentum imbalance distributions for dijet and photon-jet pairs,
and the nuclear modiﬁcation of jet shape function (at par-
tonic level). The dynamical evolution and space-time pro-
ﬁles such as the local temperature and ﬂow velocity of the
hot and dense QGP medium created in Pb+Pb collisions are
simulated using the (2+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynam-
ics model (VISH2+1) developed by The Ohio State University

group [59–61]. The coupled differential transport equations,
Eq. (8) and Eq. (9), are solved numerically to study the evo-
lution and modiﬁcation of the full jet shower in the hot and
dense nuclear medium. One of the key quantities in determin-
ing the medium effect on the full jet evolution are the transport
coefﬁcients ˆe and ˆq, which not only control the effect of elastic
collisions on the shower partons, but also govern the amount
of medium-induced radiation. In this work, we relate ˆq to the
local temperature and ﬂow velocity of the QGP medium by
dimensional argument as follows:

ˆq(τ, ~r) = ˆq0 ·

T 3(τ,~r)
0 (τ0,~0)
T 3

·

p · u(τ, ~r)

p0

.

(10)

where pµ is the four-momentum of the propagating parton, uµ
is the local four-velocity of the medium ﬂow, and the multi-
plicative factor p · u/p0 is to account for the ﬂow effect on the
jet modiﬁcation, i.e., the effective value of ˆq with the presence
of the medium ﬂow is different from that in a static medium
[62]. In the above equation, ˆq0 denotes the value of the trans-
port parameter ˆq for a quark jet at the center of the QGP at
the initial time τ0 = 0.6 fm/c in most central (0-10%) col-
lisions. From the value of ˆq, we obtain the collision energy
loss rate ˆe via the relation ˆq = 4T ˆe, with the assumption
that the medium is close to local thermal equilibrium and the
ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem can be applied [63]. With the
above setup, there is only one parameter ˆq0 in our calcula-
tion, which we may tune to describe one set of jet quenching
observable.

We ﬁrst ﬁx our model parameter ˆq0 by comparing to the
experimental measurements of the nuclear modiﬁcation fac-
tor RAA for single inclusive jet spectra, which is deﬁned as
follows:

RAA =

1

hNcolli

d2NAA/dηdpT
d2Npp/dηdpT

,

(11)

where hNcolli is the event-averaged number of binary
nucleon-nucleon collisions at a given centrality class. In our
study, the number of the binary nucleon-nucleon collisions

4

as well as their spatial distribution in the transverse plane in
Pb+Pb collisions are calculated using the Glauber model [64];
the later is used to simulate the distribution of initial jet pro-
duction points. The full jet spectrum in p+p collisions is ob-
tained via PYTHIA simulation [57] combined with FASTJET
package for full jet reconstruction [58]. After ﬁxing the initial
production point and the propagation direction for a full jet,
its propagation and evolution in the hot and dense medium
in terms of the quarks’ and gluons’ three-dimensional mo-
mentum distribution is described according to Eq. (8) and
Eq. (9). Here we only include the interaction of jets and
medium in the partonic phase, and the medium effect on jets
in hadronic phase is usually small and neglected in the cur-
rent study. Thus, when the local medium temperature drops
below Tc = 160 MeV, we turn off the jet-medium interac-
tion. After the jet exits the partonic medium, we use the
three-dimensional momentum distribution of quarks and glu-
ons contained in the full jet to calculate various quantities for
the quenched full jet, and compare to initial unquenched jets.

[65, 66].

In Fig. 3, we show our numerical results for the nuclear
modiﬁcation factor RAA of single inclusive full jet spectra
in Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 ATeV at the LHC: the panel (a)
for most central 0-10% collisions, and the panel (b) for mid-
central 30-40% collisions, compared to the full jet RCP mea-
sured by the ATLAS and ALICE Collaborations [65, 66]. In
our calculation, we impose a Gaussian smearing for the jet
energies and jet spectra in both p+p and Pb+Pb collisions to
take into account the hadronization effect and the reconstruc-
tion efﬁciency in the expreiment measurements. As the recon-
struction efﬁciency varies in different experiments, we ﬁx the
smearing factor by comparing to full jet spectra measured in
the reference p+p collisions [67]. From the ﬁgure, we can see
that our model calculation can give a reasonable description
of the nuclear modiﬁcation factor RAA for single inclusive
full jets in both most central and mid-central Pb+Pb collisions
at 2.76 ATeV. We also note the deviation in the smaller pT
regime where there exist larger uncertainties in the experimen-
tal measurements as well. From ﬁtting to the single inclusive
full jet RAA, we obtain the value for our model parameter as
ˆq0 ≈ 1.7 GeV2/fm for a quark jet at the center of the medium
at the initial time τ0 in most central 0-10% Pb+Pb collisions
at 2.76 ATeV. This value is consistent with the value obtained
by JET Collaboration [13], in which the jet transport param-
eter was extracted by comparing ﬁve different jet energy loss
model calculations to the experimental measurements of sin-
gle inclusive hadron RAA in most central Au+Au collisions
at 200 AGeV at RHIC and in most central Pb+Pb collisions
at 2.76 ATeV at the LHC. The calculation of single inclusive
full jet RAA presented in Fig. 3 provides the baseline to study
other full jet observables and investigate in more details the
roles of different jet-medium interaction mechanisms for the
medium modiﬁcation of full jets.

We now present our numerical results for the nuclear mod-
iﬁcation of dijet momentum imbalance AJ distribution in
Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 ATeV at the LHC, where the mo-
mentum imbalance factor AJ is deﬁned as:

AJ =

pT,1 − pT,2
pT,1 + pT,2

,

(12)

with pT,1 and pT,2 the transverse momenta of the leading and
subleading jets. The nuclear modiﬁcation of dijet momen-
tum imbalance distribution was one of the ﬁrst measurements
of full jets in Pb+Pb collisions after the launch of the LHC
[18], which showed a signiﬁcant change of the dijet AJ dis-
tribution in central Pb+Pb collisions compared to that in the
reference p+p collisions. Various studies have shown that the
measured modiﬁcation results for dijet AJ distribution can be
explained quite well by the energy loss experienced by the
full jets when they propagate through and interact with the
hot and dense nuclear medium produced in relativistic heavy-
ion collisions [26–33, 35, 69]. In Fig. 4, we show our cal-
culation for dijet momentum imbalance AJ distribution in

most central 0-10% and mid-central (30-40%) Pb+Pb colli-
sions at 2.76 ATeV, compared with the measurements from
CMS Collaboration [68].
In this calculation, the smearing
factor for the jet energies is tuned such that the experimen-
tal ‘PYTHIA+HYDJET’ simulation results can be described.
As we can see, using the same values for the jet transport pa-
rameter ˆq0 as in the single inclusive full jet RAA calculation,
our model can give a good description of the nuclear modi-
ﬁcation of dijet momentum imbalance distribution in Pb+Pb
collisions at 2.76 ATeV at the LHC.

Photon-tagged jets have been proposed to be one of the
golden channels for studying jet energy loss and jet quench-
ing in relativisitic heavy-ion collisions [70, 71] due to the fact
that the photon transverse momentum is a good reference for
that of the away-side partonic jet at the initial production time
(We note that this is only true at the leading order). The mo-
mentum imbalance distribution of photon-jet pairs has also
been measured in Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 ATeV at the LHC
[20], and the result is quite similar to dijet pairs. Various phe-
nomenological calculations have also been performed for the
nuclear modiﬁcation of photon-jet momentum imbalance dis-
tribution [36–38]. In Fig. 5, we show our current calculation

in most central 0-10% and mid-central 30-40% Pb+Pb colli-
sions at 2.76 ATeV, compared with the measurements from
CMS Collaboration [20]. Both our calculation and the exper-
imental data show that the event distribution of xJγ moves
towards smaller value of xJγ due to the energy loss of the
away-side jet during the proagation through the hot and dense
medium produced in the collisions.

Up to now, we have presented the results for the nuclear
modiﬁcations of single inclusive jet spectra and the momen-
tum imbalance of dijet and photon-jet pairs in Pb+Pb colli-
sions at 2.76 ATeV. As is known, these observables are only
sensitive to the total energy (loss) of the full jets. One of the
advantages of full jets is that one can look at their internal
strucutres and study how the distribution of the energy and
momentum within the jet cone are modiﬁed due to the inter-
action with the medium. One popular quantity is jet shape
function which describes the energy distribution along the ra-

dial/transverse direction of the full jet. In the experiments, the
(differential) jet shape function is deﬁned as follows:

pi
T
pjet
T

θ[ri − (r − 1

2 δr)]θ[(r + 1

2 δr) − ri]

δr

, (13)

ρjet(r) =Xi
where ri = p(ηi − ηjet)2 + (φi − φjet)2, δr is the size of

the bin, and the sum over i runs over all constituents of the
full jets with a given cone size. In the real analysis, one also
performs the average over all the jets that satisfy the required
condition: ρ(r) = 1
above-deﬁned differential jet shape function is normalized to

Njet Pjet ρjet(r). It is easy to see that the

unity,R ρ(r)dr = 1.

In Fig. 6, we show the nuclear modiﬁcation factor
Rρ
AA(r) = ρAA(r)/ρpp(r) for the single inclusive jet shape
function ρ(r) in most central 0-10% (a) and mid-central 30-
40% (b) Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 ATeV at the LHC, com-
pared with the data from CMS Collaboration [23].
In this
ﬁgure, we put the same jet energy cut as CMS Collaboration:
pT > 100 GeV. One can see that our calculation shows the
same modiﬁcation pattern as the measurements from the CMS
Collaboration, i.e., an enhancement at larger values of r and

a depletion at intermediate values of r. The enhancement at
larger values of r can be understood as the combinational ef-
fect of medium-induced radiation and transverse momentum
broadening. Since the differential jet function ρ(r) is normal-
ized to unity, the enhancement at larger r must be compen-
sated by some depletion at smaller values of r. This also im-
plies that the nuclear modiﬁcation of ρ(r) at large values of
r is very sensitive to the modiﬁcation at smaller values of r,
since ρ(r) is a deep-falling function of r. We also note that the
modiﬁcation at the very small values of r is very small. This
is because for high energy jets, the inner hard core of the full
jets is very difﬁcult to be modiﬁed by the medium in contrast
to the outer soft part of the full jets. Below, we will investi-
gate in more details the jet energy and ﬂavor dependence for
the nuclear modiﬁcation of jet shape function.

FIG. 7: (Color online) The nuclear modiﬁcation factor Rρ
AA(r) =
ρAA(r)/ρpp(r) for the differential jet shape function of quark,
gluon and inclusive jets in most central 0-10% Pb+Pb collisions at

panel (b) for pT > 50GeV.

As has been shown in Fig. 2, gluon jets are broader than
quark jets in p+p collisions. It is interesting to see whether
the nuclear modiﬁcations of jet shape functions for gluon and
quark jets are very different, given that gluon jets interact with

the medium more strongly. Such effect can be investigated
experimentally by comparing the single inclusive jets and the

that the difference between quark and gluon jets can lead to
a very different nuclear modiﬁcation behavior for the photon-
tagged jet shape function compared to Fig. 6; it increases
monotonously from small values of r to large values r. To
check such effect, in Fig. 7 we show the nuclear modiﬁcation
factors of jet shape functions for quark and gluon jets. The
results for two jet energy cuts are compared: pT > 100 GeV
in the upper panel (a), and pT > 50 GeV in the lower panel
(b). We can see that the nuclear modiﬁcation effect for the
gluon jets is a little more than quark jets, but the difference
is quite moderate. One may notice that the nuclear modiﬁ-
cation factor for inclusive jet shape function does not lie be-
tween those for quark and gluon jets in many r bins. This is
because the fractions of quark jets are larger in Pb+Pb than
p+p collisions for jets with the same energies. In this case,
the nuclear modiﬁcation factor Rρ
AA(r) of jet shape function
for inclusive jets, as compared to those for quark and gluon
jets, becomes sensitive to the ratio ρg(r)/ρq(r) of quark’s
and gluon’s jet shape functions, and the change of such ra-
tio from p+p to Pb+Pb collisions; the latter is related to ratio
of the nuclear modiﬁcation factors of gluon’s and quark’s jet
shape functions Rρg
AA(r). Interestingly, we observe a
monotonic behavior for the nuclear modiﬁcation of jet shape
function for both quark and gluon jets when a lower jet energy
cut (pT > 50 GeV) is used. In particular, a signifcant depele-
tion of the energy in very small values of r is observed for
lower energy jets (pT > 50 GeV). This very different from the
case of higher energy jets (pT > 100 GeV), for which there is
much smaller modiﬁcation of jet shape function at very small
r. The above result tells that while jet-medium interaction
does not affect much the inner core of very high energy jets,
the medium can produce a sizable effect on the inner core of
lower energy jets. We have also checked the jet energy depen-
dence for the nuclear modiﬁcation of photon-tagged jet shape
function, and the result is quite similar to the case of single
inclusive jets when the same jet energy cuts are used for the
observed jets.

IV. ROLES OF DIFFERENT JET-MEDIUM INTERACTION

MECHANISMS

In the previous section, we have presented the numerical
results for different full jet observables, including the single
inclusive jet RAA, the dijet and photon-jet momentum imbal-
ance, and the nuclear modiﬁcation of jet shape function. The
modiﬁcation of full jets by the interaction with the medium is
calculated from solving the coupled differential equations in
Eq. (8) and Eq. (9) for the three-dimensional momentum dis-
tributon of the shower partons within the full jets. As has been
mentioned, we have included several contributions during the
full jet evolution, corresponding to various terms in the dif-
ferential equations: the collisional energy loss and transverse
momentum diffusion experienced by the shower partons, and
the medium-induced radiative (splitting) processes. By turn-

ing on and off the corresponding terms in the evolution equa-
tions, we can investigate the contributions from different jet-
medium interaction mechanisms on the propagation and mod-
iﬁcation of the full jets.

FIG. 8: (Color online) The relative contributions from different jet-
medium interaction mechanisms to the total full quark (a) and gluon
(b) jet energy loss. The jets are produced at the center of the medium
created in most central 0-10% Pb+Pb collisions and propagte along
φ = 0 direction.

In Fig. 8, we show the relative contributions to the total
energy loss of the full jets from different jet-medium interac-
tion mechanisms, namely the medium-induced radiation di-
rectly outside the jet cone, the transverse momentum broad-
ening caused by the kicks from the medium constituents, and
the collisional energy loss experienced by the shower partons.
The upper panel (a) is for quark jets, and the lower panel (b)
for gluon jets. In this ﬁgure, jets are initially produced at the
center of most central 0-10% Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 ATeV
and propagate along φ = 0 direction in the transverse plane.
Obviously, the gluon jets lose more energy than quark jets
when they pass through the same medium. Also full jets
with higher energies tend to lose more energy than lower en-
ergy jets when they pass through the same medium (note that
the fractional energy loss descreases with the increase of jet

8

energy). Comparing different jet-medium interaction mech-
anisms, we observe that the most important contribution to
the full jet energy loss is the collisional energy loss experi-
enced by the shower partons. This can be understood from the
fact that many soft partons at the periphery of the full jets are
easily thermalized and absorbed by the hot and dense nuclear
medium. Another observation is that the contribution from the
medium-induced radiation directly outside the jet cone is very
small, which is very different from the energy loss of leading
parton. This is because most of the radiations from the full jet
shower are collinear radiations which are inside the jet cone.
The transverse momentum broadening via binary collisions
with the medium constituents provide moderate contribution
to total energy loss of the full jets. In the ﬁgure, we also show
the combinational effects from the coupling of different inter-
action mechanisms. For example, although medium-induced
radiation provides a very small direct contribution to the full
jet energy loss, but it can greatly enhance the contribution
from other mechanisms due to the increasing of the number
of shower partons via the parton splitting process.

FIG. 9: (Color online) The relative contributions from different jet-
medium interaction mechanisms to the nuclear modiﬁcation of the
differential jet shape function. The jets are produced at the center
of the medium created in most central 0-10% pb+pb collisions and
propagte along φ = 0 direction. The upper panel (a) for inclusive
jets with pT > 100 GeV, and the lower panel (b) for pT > 50 GeV.

Now we analyze the effects from different jet-medium in-
teraction mechanisms on the modiﬁcation of jet shape func-
tion. As has been mentioned, the nuclear modiﬁcation of jet
shape function has a strong dependence on the jet energies.
Therefore, in Fig. 9 we show the modication of jet shape
function of single inclusive jet for two different jet energy
cuts: the upper panel (a) for pT > 100 GeV, and the lower
panel (b) for pT > 50 GeV. We ﬁrst look at the upper plot
(pT > 100 GeV). One can see that while the medium-induced
radiation provides very little direct contribution to full jet en-
ergy loss, it modiﬁes jet shape function dramatically: it trans-
ports the energy of jet from the center to the periphery, and
therefore leads to a suppression of jet shape function at the
center and an enhancement at at the periphery. The transverse
momentum broadening experienced by the shower partons has
a similar effect. The collisional energy loss, however, has the
inverse effect on the modiﬁcation of jet shape function, i.e., it
leads to a suppression at the periphery and an enhancement at
the center. This means that the energy ﬂowing to the medium
from the leading parton is relatively smaller than that from the
periphery of the full jets. The reason is that the soft partons at
the periphery of the full jets are easily to be absorbed by the
medium, while the leading parton and the hard core of the full
jets is much more difﬁcult to be affected by the medium. The
combination of the above three different effects leads to the
same modiﬁcation pattern as the results from the CMS Col-
laboration for pT > 100 GeV. Now we turn to the result for
pT > 50 GeV (the lower plot). We can see that since the
jet energy becomes smaller, the effects from all three differ-
ent jet-medium mechanisms on the modiﬁcation of jet shape
function become a larger, both at the center and the periphery
of the full jets. One of the most interesting result is that the
combination of three different mechanisms leads to a mono-
tonic increase of the nuclear modiﬁcation of the shape func-
tion for pT > 50 GeV, which is very different from the result
for pT > 100GeV (also see Fig. 7). This might be understood
from the combination of two effects: the broadening effect of
the jet shape increases and the change of the inner core of the
full jets becomes easier, as one decreases the jet energies.

Finally in Fig. 10, we show the sensitivity for the nuclear
modiﬁcation of jet shape function to the value of jet transport
parameter ˆq0. We can see that with the increase of ˆq0 value (as
a result, the medium induced radiation, the transverse momen-
tum broadening effect and the collisional energy loss all in-
creases), the effects from three jet-medium interaction mech-
anisms on the nuclear modiﬁcation of jet shape function in-
creases when they are turned on individually. However, the
ﬁnal observed modiﬁcation of jet shape function is a com-
binational effect from three different jet-medium interaction
mechanisms, in particular, the modiﬁcation from one interac-
tion mechanism may be diminished or canceled out by another
mechanism. Therefore, after turning on all three jet-medium
interaction mechanisms, the nuclear modiﬁcation effect of jet
shape function actually becomes a little smaller when increas-
ing the jet transport parameter ˆq0. This means that the nuclear

V. SUMMARY

We have forumlated a set of coupled differential transport
equations to study the evolution of full jet shower in quark-
gluon plasma. The equations describe the evolution of the
three-dimensional momentum distributions of quarks and glu-
ons contained in the full jets, and incoporate three different
jet-medium interaction mechanisms: medium-induced radia-
tion, transverse momentum broadening and collisional energy
loss, for both leading and radiated partons of the full jets. Dur-
ing the evolution, we keep track of both the energies and the
transverse momenta of all shower partons in the full jet, thus
the medium modiﬁcation of full jet energy as well as jet in-
ternal structure due to jet-medium interaction can be studied
straightforwardly. We apply our formalism to calculate the
nuclear modiﬁcation of single inclusive jet spectra, the mo-
mentum imbalance of photon-jet and dijet pairs, and the jet
shape (at partonic level) in Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 ATeV at
the LHC by combining a realistic (2+1)-dimensional viscous
hydrodynamic simulation to describe the space-time proﬁles
of the hot and dense nuclear medium produced in the colli-
sions.

By turning on and off different jet-medium interaction
mechanisms, we have studied the effects from different mech-
anisms on the full jet energy loss and on the nuclear modiﬁ-
cation of the differential jet shape function. We ﬁnd that the
medium-induced radiation contributes very little to the direct
full jet energy loss, but can increase the number of partons in
the full jets. It can also transports the energy of full jet from
the center to the periphery, which is similar to the transverse

10

momentum broadening. Therefore, the medium-induced ra-
diation and transverse momentum broadening both produce
a suppression of jet shape function at the center and an en-
hanceat at the periphery. The collisional energy loss plays an
important role in both full jet energy loss and the modiﬁcation
of the differential jet shower. Since the soft partons at the pe-
riphery of the full jets are easily thermalized by the medium
and then the energy ﬂows to the medium, thus it provides a
signiﬁcant contribution to total energy loss from the jet cone.
It also leads to the suppression of jet shape function at the
periphery and an enhancement at the center. Combing these
three jet-medium interaction mechanisms, we obtain similar
results as the CMS Collaboration for the nuclear modiﬁcation
of jet shape function. We have also found that the nuclear
modiﬁcation of jet shape function is quite sensitive to full jet
energies. For low energy jets, we observe a monotonically
increasing behavior for the nuclear modiﬁcation of jet shape
function due to the increasing of the broadening effect as well
as the easier modiﬁcation of the inner part of the full jets, as
compared to very high energy jets.

In summary, various full jet observables in relativistic
heavy-ion collisions can be explained by the interaction of

full jets with the hot and dense medium created in the ener-
getic collisions. The nuclear modiﬁcation of jet shape func-
tion is very sensitive to the interplay of different jet-medium
interaction mechanisms. Therefore it is important to include
all relavant jet-medium interaction mechnisms for a compre-
hensive understanding of the medium modiﬁcation of full jet
production and jet shape function in relativistic heavy-ion col-
lisions. In the future, we may improve our calculation in the
following directions. The inclusion of the energy dependence
of various transport coefﬁcients should be helpful to obtain
a better description of the energy dependence on the full jet
modiﬁcation. The response of the medium to the energy and
momentum deposition by the full jets may also affect the en-
ergy and internal structure of the reconstructed full jets [72].
These are left for future effort.
