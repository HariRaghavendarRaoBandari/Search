THE OPTIMAL TRILINEAR RESTRICTION ESTIMATE FOR A CLASS

OF HYPERSURFACES WITH CURVATURE

IOAN BEJENARU

Abstract. In [3] nearly optimal L1 trilinear restriction estimates in Rn+1 are established
under transversality assumptions only. In this paper we show that the curvature improves
the range of exponents, by establishing Lp estimates, for any p > 2(n+4)
3(n+2) in the case of
double-conic surfaces. The exponent 2(n+4)
3(n+2) is shown to be the universal threshold for the
trilinear estimate.

1. Introduction

For n ≥ 1, let U ⊂ Rn be an open, bounded and connected neighborhood of the origin and
let Σ : U → Rn+1 be a smooth parametrization of an n-dimensional submanifold of Rn+1
(hypersurface), which we denote by S = Σ(U). To this we associate the operator E deﬁned
by

Given k smooth, compact hypersurfaces Si ⊂ Rn+1, i = 1, .., k, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n + 1, the
k-linear restriction estimate is the following inequality

In a more compact format this estimate is abbreviated as follows:

R∗(2 × ... × 2 → p).

The fundamental question regarding the above estimate is the value of the optimal p for
which it holds true. Given that the estimate R∗(2 × ... × 2 → ∞) is trivial, the optimality
is translated into the smallest p for which the estimate holds true. In [3] Bennett, Carbery
and Tao clariﬁed the role of transversality between the surfaces involved and established
that under a transversality condition between S1, .., Sk the optimal exponent is p = 2
k−1; the
actual result in [3] is near-optimal, the optimal problem is currently open. The optimality
can be easily revealed by taking Si to be transversal hyperplanes, in which case the estimate
becomes the classical Loomis-Whitney inequality.

It is also known, in some cases (precisely when k ≤ 2), or expected, in most of the others,
that curvature assumptions improve the range of exponents in (1.1), except for the case
k = n + 1. In [3], the authors state that ”simple heuristics suggest that the optimal k-linear
restriction theory requires at least n + 1 − k non-vanishing principal curvatures, but that
further curvature assumptions have no further eﬀect”. However, this aspect of the theory is
left as an open problem in [3]. We detail below what is known for each k.

The case k = 1 has been understood for a very long time. Without any curvature assump-
tions, the optimal exponent is p = ∞; once the surface has some non-vanishing principal
curvatures, the exponent improves to p = 2(l+2)
, where l is the number of non-vanishing
principal curvatures. The case of non-zero Gaussian curvature, corresponding to l = n, is
the classical result due to Tomas-Stein, see [19].

The case k = 2 without any curvature assumptions corresponds to the classical L2 bilinear
estimate, where the optimal estimate has been established. The case k = 2 with curvature
assumptions brought a twist into the understanding of the role of curvature in this problem.
The best possible exponent in R∗(2 × 2 → p) is p = n+3
n+1 and it was conjectured in [11]; it
came as a surprise the fact that it was optimal not only for paraboloids (having n non-zero
principal curvatures), but also for cones (having n − 1 non-zero principal curvatures and
a vanishing principal curvature). This problem was intensely studied for most important
model surfaces, see [4, 25, 22, 23, 20, 16, 17]. In [2], we addressed the problem for general
surfaces and revealed a more subtle way in which the curvature comes into play by stating
conditions in terms of the shape operators of the surfaces involved.

The last case for which (1.1) is fairly well-understood is the case k = n + 1. We note
that in this case, additional curvature assumptions have no eﬀect on the optimality of p and
this is consistent with the expectation that the optimal k-linear restriction theory requires
at least n + 1 − k non-vanishing principal curvatures, which in this case translates into
no curvature. It is conjectured that if the hypersurfaces Si ⊂ Rn+1 are transversal, then
(1.1) holds true for p ≥ p0 = 2
If Si are transversal hyperplanes, (1.1) is the classical
n.
Loomis-Whitney inequality and its proof is elementary. Once the surfaces are allowed to
have non-zero principal curvatures, things become far more complicated and the problem
has been the subject of extensive research, see [3, 13] and references therein. In [3], Bennett,
Carbery and Tao establish a near-optimal version of (1.1): this is (1.1) with an additional
Rǫ factor when the estimate is made over balls of radius R in Rn+1. The optimal result for
(1.1), that is without the ǫ-loss, is an open problem; in some cases one can use ǫ-removal
techniques to derive the result without the ǫ-loss for p > 2
n , see [8] for the case of surfaces
with non-vanishing Gaussian curvature. The end-point for the multilinear Kakeya version
of (1.1) (a slightly weaker statement than (1.1)) has been established by Guth in [13] using
tools from algebraic topology.

In the remaining cases, n ≥ 3 and 3 ≤ k ≤ n, the k-linear restriction theory has been
k−1. The
2
k−1 is sharp for generic surfaces, but it is not expected to be the optimal exponent

addressed in [3] where the authors established the near-optimal result for p ≥ 2
exponent
once curvature assumptions are brought into the problem.

k(n+k−1); note that this is strictly smaller than the generic optimal value

In this paper make a ﬁrst step towards understanding the eﬀect of curvature in the cases
3 ≤ k ≤ n. We will argue that the correct conjectured best optimal exponent should be
p(k) = 2(n+1+k)
2
k−1. The
easy task is to show that one cannot obtain any estimates for p < p(k), regardless of the
amount of curvature involved; this is done by using the classical squashed-cap example. The
more diﬃcult task is to show that the conjecture is not vacuous by proving it for some class
of surfaces: the multi-conical surfaces.

In this paper we look at the trilinear estimate corresponding to k = 3 and prove the
conjecture for a particular class of surfaces: the double-conic ones. These surfaces have the
nice property that they have the exact ”amount” of curvature to obtain the estimate with

2

the optimal exponent p(3), and no more, in the sense that they are ”ﬂat” in the unnecessary
directions. This result is comparable to the one of Wolf [25] where he proves the bilinear
restriction estimate for conical surfaces (which would translate into 1-conical surfaces in our
context).

In a forthcoming paper we will provide the equivalent result for 4 ≤ k ≤ n for k −1-conical
surfaces. The reason to split the case k = 3 from k ≥ 4 is that the argument for the latter
case incurs not only additional technical diﬃculties, but also conceptual ones.

We now formalize the above introduction and start with the statement of the conjecture.

Conjecture. Under appropriate transversality and curvature conditions on the surfaces Si,
R∗(2 × ... × 2 → p) holds true for any p ≥ p(k) = 2(n+1+k)
k(n+k−1).

A complete resolution of this problem should have important consequences. The multi-
linear theory discussed above has had major impact in other problems. We mention a few
such examples: In Harmonic Analysis, the bilinear and n + 1 restriction theory was used to
improve results in the context of Schr¨odinger maximal function, see [5, 15, 21, 10], restric-
tion conjecture, see [23, 8, 12], the decoupling conjecture, see [7, 6]. In Partial Diﬀerential
Equations, the linear theory inspired the Strichartz estimates, see [24], while the bilinear
restriction theory is used in the context of more sophisticated techniques, such as the proﬁle
decomposition, see [18], and concentration compactness methods, see [14]. We expect that a
positive resolution of the Conjecture will have an impact in some of the problems mentioned
above.

We will make an attempt in shedding some light into the appropriate conditions required
above, but we believe that only a complete resolution of the Conjecture will clarify the role
of geometry into the problem.

The transversality condition is clear by now: for any choice ζi ∈ Si, i = 1, .., k, if Ni(ζi) is

the unit normal to Si, then the

vol(N1(ζ1), .., Nk(ζk)) ≥ ν > 0

where vol(N1(ζ1), .., Nk(ζk)) is the volume of the k-dimensional parallelepiped generated by
the normals Ni(ζi). This is natural to impose, given that it matches the condition required
in the generic case where no curvature is assumed, see [3].

The more delicate part is to list the curvature conditions on Si. For a hypersurface
S ⊂ Rn+1 and ζ ∈ S, we denote by N(ζ) the normal to S (assumed to be orientable) at ζ
and by SN (ζ) the shape operator at S at ζ ∈ S with respect to the normal N(ζ). For an
in-depth introduction to the shape operator, we refer the reader to any classical textbook in
diﬀerential geometry, see for instance [9]. For a quick introduction tailored towards the use
in the context of bilinear estimates, see [2]. Note that we use the same letter S both for the
hypersurface and the shape operator: the subscript N will indicate that we are referring to
the shape operator.

As for the role of curvature in the above Conjecture, we anticipate a condition of type

vol(N1(ζ1), .., Nk(ζk), SNj (ζj )vk+1, .., SNj(ζj )vn+1) ≥ ν > 0

for any choices ζi ∈ Si, i = 1, .., k, for any j ∈ {1, .., k}, for any choice ζj ∈ Sj and for any
choice vk+1, .., vn+1 is a orthonormal vector basis to speciﬁc n−k+1-dimensional submanifolds
S ⊂ Sj (it suﬃces to check this for one basis). Here SNi(ζi) is the shape operator at Si at

3

ζi ∈ Si with respect to the normal Ni(ζi). We expect these submanifolds to be exhausted by
the family

S(β1, .., βj−1, βj+1, .., βn+1) = Sj ∩l6=j (βl + Sl).

for any choices β1, .., βj−1, βj+1, .., βn+1 ∈ Rn+1. But we do not go as far as claiming this to
be the ultimate curvature condition.

In Section 7 we show, by a counterexample, that the range stated in the conjecture is sharp,
that is (1.1) fails for p < 2(n+1+k)
k(n+k−1) for conic surfaces, but also for quadratic surfaces. This
highlights that regardless of how much curvature is brought into the problem, the threshold
2(n+1+k)
k(n+k−1) is the best exponent that can occur in R∗(2 × ... × 2 → p).

As for positive results, in this paper we look at the case k = 3 and establish the almost
optimal conjectured result for a particular class of hypersurfaces which we introduce below.
We recall the deﬁnition of a foliation. A 2-dimensional foliation of the (n-dimensional)
hypersurface S is a decomposition of S into a union of connected disjoint sets {Sα}α∈A, called
the leaves of the foliation, with the following property: every point in S has a neighborhood
V and local system of coordinates x : V ⊂ S → Rn such that for each leaf Sα, the coordinates
of V ∩ Sα are ξ3 = constant, .., ξn = constant.

We are now ready to formalize the conditions we impose on our surfaces. As before,
Si, ∈ {1, 2, 3} are hypersurfaces with smooth parameterizations Σi : Ui ⊂ Rn → Rn+1, where
each Ui are open, bounded and connected neighborhood of the origin (note that diﬀerent Ui
may belong to diﬀerent hyperplanes identiﬁed with the same Rn). In addition, we assume
the following three hypothesis:

i) (foliation) for each i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, the hypersurface Si admits the foliation

where, for each α, the leaf Si,α is a ﬂat submanifold of dimension 2.

Si,α

Si =[α

ii) (the leaves are completely ﬂat) If SNi(ζi) is the shape operator of Si at ζi ∈ Si with
choice of normal Ni(ζi) we assume that for every v ∈ TζiSi,α (the tangent plane at Si,α at
the point ζi ∈ Si,α) the following holds

SNi(ζi)v = 0.

iii) (transversality and curvature) For any ζi ∈ Si, i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, for any l ∈ {1, 2, 3} and

for any orthonormal basis v4, .., vk+1 ∈ (TζlSl,α)⊥ ⊂ TζlSl,α the following holds true
(1.2)

vol(N1(ζ1), N2(ζ2), N3(ζ3), SNl(ζl)v4, ..., SNl(ζl)vn+1) ≥ ν.

In (1.2) the vol is the standard volume form of n + 1 vectors in Rn+1, thus the condition
quantiﬁes the linear independence of the vectors N1(ζ1), N2(ζ2), N3(ζ3), SNl(ζl)v4, ..., SNl(ζl)vn+1.
The condition ii) says that Si,α are, in some sense, completely ﬂat components of Si since,
besides being subsets of aﬃne planes of dimension 2, the normal N(ζ) to Si is constant as
we vary ζ along Si,α for ﬁxed α.

The ﬁrst things to read in condition iii) is the transversality condition between S1, S2 and
S3 due to the transversality between any choice on normals. The condition iii) also says that
the submanifolds transversal to the leafs carry the curvature assumptions, in the sense that
their tangent space does not contain any eigenvectors of the shape operator. In addition, for
each i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, we are guaranteed to have transversality between N1(ζ1), N2(ζ2), N3(ζ3)
and SNiTζi(Sl,α)⊥.

At this point we can state the main result of this paper.

Theorem 1.1. Assume that S1, S2, S3 satisfy the conditions i)-iii) above. Given any p with
p(3) = 2(n+4)

3(n+2) < p ≤ ∞, the following holds true

∀fi ∈ L2(Ui).

To our best knowledge this result is the ﬁrst instance when the trilinear restriction estimate
is shown to improve its range of exponents when curvature assumptions are made; this
statement has to be carefully explained, since given large enough n one can obtain trilinear
restriction estimates in Lp with p < 1 based on linear and bilinear restriction estimates,
for the latter one see [17]. We are not only going beyond the known L1 estimate, but also
provide the sharp result, except for the endpoint p = p(3), and this is truly a feature of
the trilinear estimate. In some instances, our result also improves the known results in the
range p ≥ 1, where the standard result is near-optimal, while ours is optimal. Given that the
estimate is trivial for p = ∞, it suﬃces to focus on the result above in the cases p(3) < p ≤ 1
and this is what we will do.

One aspect that is revealed by the above result is that the optimal trilinear restriction
estimate discards the eﬀect of 2 curvatures; indeed, each Si has precisely 2 vanishing principal
curvatures. In light of the similar results in the bilinear case, this result indicates that the
optimal k-linear restriction estimate discards the eﬀect of k − 1 curvatures and relies only
on n + 1 − k curvatures, although the actual statements have to be more rigorous.

Now we list some hypersurfaces that would ﬁt in our class and for each the above result

is applicable. One such model is given by the equation:

(1.4)

ζn+1 + ζn =qζ 2

1 + ... + ζ 2

n−1.

Away from the origin, this surface has 2 vanishing principal curvatures and n − 2 non-

vanishing principal curvatures. If one writes (ζ1, .., ζn−1) = r · ω with r = pζ 2

n−1
and ω ∈ Sn−2 the above equation becomes ζn+1 + ζn = r, thus revealing the source of the
vanishing curvatures as coming from the embedded planes of dimension 2; these are the
leaves of the foliation.

1 + ... + ζ 2

Another model is given by the cylinders:

ζ 2
1 + ... + ζ 2

n−1 = 1

where the freedom in choosing ζn and ζn+1 gives rise to the desired structure.

At this time we are not able to establish a similar result for more general surfaces, in
particular for hypersurfaces with non-zero Gaussian curvature, such as the paraboloid ζn+1 =
ζ 2
1 + ... + ζ 2
n. This may come as a surprise as one expects more curvature to be helpful. By
now there is enough body of evidence that additional curvature complicates these problems.
Probably the most clear piece of evidence lies in the n + 1-linear estimate in Rn+1 (where no
curvature is needed for optimal results): if the surfaces are transversal hyperplanes, the L
estimate follows easily from the classical Loomis-Whitney inequality, while if the surfaces
are assumed to have curvature, the estimate is considerably harder and open.

We now explain some of the key ideas in the proof of Theorem 1.1. Some of the starting
ideas originate in the prior work of the author on the bilinear restriction estimate in [2] and
the multilinear restriction estimate in [1].

5

The argument for the bilinear restriction estimate that we provided in [2] was inspired
by many previous works in the subject, and we chose to follow the less common approach
of Tao in [22]. One of the novelties of our argument is that it reveals in a clear way a key
feature of the argument: at some stage of it, the proof relies on replicating the argument
of the classical bilinear L2 estimate (on the Fourier side, thanks to the Plancherel fromula).
To be more speciﬁc, inside the body of the argument, we reproduce a proof of the bilinear
estimate

(1.5)

kE1f1 · E2f2kL2 . kf1kL2(U1)kf2kL2(U2),

where transversality assumptions are made on S1 = Σ1(U1) and S2 = Σ2(U2). This bilinear
estimate is used in a localized setup, meaning that one quantiﬁes the eﬀect of U1 or U2
having small support. We note that in the combinatorial strategy of proving the bilinear
restriction estimate, used for instance in [23], one replaces the bilinear L2 estimate with its
quadralinear version and the relevance of the bilinear L2 estimate (1.5) is less apparent.

Thus the natural idea is to follow the same route in the trilinear setup, that is to rely, at

some stage of the argument, on the trilinear estimate

(1.6)

kE1f1 · E2f2 · E3f3kL1 . kf1kL2(U1)kf2kL2(U2)kf3kL2(U3).

This is where one hits an immediate road-block. While the bilinear L2 estimate is well
understood and very malleable, with arguments that easily blend into those used in [2], we
found the trilinear L1 estimate to be very rigid. In particular, one needs to use the estimate in
a black-box fashion. Moreover, one needs to use a localized version of the trilinear estimate,
in the sense that one of the factors has small frequency support, or, equivalently, the surface
has small support in some directions. We have not found such a result in literature and
probably for a good reason: all the previous proofs for the multilinear restriction estimates
seem to go through the multilinear Kakeya and it is not clear how to translate the localized
multilinear estimate into a multilinear Kakeya estimate. This was part of the motivation for
our work in [1] where we provided a direct proof of the multilinear estimate, followed by a
reﬁnement in the context of small support. In Section 5 we adapt the result from [1] to our
current needs.

The next tool is to construct tables adapted to waves which are able to highlight the
dispersive eﬀects in outer regions. This is done by using a wave packet decomposition and
as in [2], we use of the reﬁned wave packet decomposition introduced by Tao in [22]. This
requires a bit more work than the classical wave packet construction, but it has the advantage
of providing a direct venue for closing the argument for p > p(3) without additional ǫ-removal
techniques, see [20] for example. This is important because the ǫ-removal results, see [20,
Lemma 2.4], work for Lp spaces with p > 1, hence they do not cover the ranges of Lp spaces
we are interested in.

We expect to be able to obtain a similar result to the one in Theorem 1.1 for the k-linear
restriction estimate with k ≥ 4. The argument provided here fails to work for k ≥ 4 and
we can easily point to such an instance: the key estimate (6.4) is an L1 estimate and the
triangle inequality holds in this space, but it fails in L
k−1 (and this is the space to be used
in the corresponding step for the k-linear restriction estimate). But, in fact, there are more
subtle points where the argument here simply fails to carry over to the case k ≥ 4.

1.1. Notation. We start by clarifying the role of various constants that appear in the ar-
gument. N is a large integer that depends only on the dimension. C is a large constant that
may change from line to line, may depend on N, but not on c and C0 introduced below. C
is used in the deﬁnition of: A.B, meaning A ≤ CB, A ≪ B, meaning A ≤ C −1B, and
A ≈ B, meaning A . B ∧ B . A. For a given number r ≥ 0, by A = O(r) we mean that
A ≈ r. C0 is a constant that is independent of any other constant and its role is to reduce
the size of cubes in the inductive argument. It can be set C0 = 4 throughout the argument,
but we keep it this way so that its role in the argument is not lost. c ≪ 1 is a very small
variable meant to make expressions ≪ 1 and most estimates will be stated to hold in a range
of c.

We use the standard notation (ξ1, .., ¯ξi, ..ξl) := (ξ1, .., ξi−1, ξi+1.., ξl) to mean that one com-

ponent is missing.

By powers of type Rα+ we mean Rα+ǫ for arbitrary ǫ > 0. Practically they should be
seen as Rα+ǫ for arbitrary 0 < ǫ.1. The estimates where such powers occur will obviously
depend on ǫ.

By B(x, R) we denote the ball centered at x with radius R in the underlying space (most

of the time it will be Rn or Rn+1).

Let η0 : Rn → [0, +∞) be a Schwartz function, normalized in L1, that is kη0kL1 = 1,
and with Fourier transform supported on the unit ball. Given some r > 0 we denote by
ηr(x) = r−nη0(r−1x) and note that ˆηr is supported in B(0, r).

A disk D ⊂ Rn+1 has the form

D = D(xD, tD; rD) = {(x, tD) ∈ Rn+1 : |x − xD| ≤ rD},

for some (xD, tD) ∈ Rn+1 and rD > 0. We deﬁne the associated smooth cut-oﬀ

˜χD(x, t) = (1 +

|x − xD|

rD

)−N .

A cube Q ⊂ Rn+1 of size R has the standard deﬁnition Q = {(x, t) ∈ Rn+1 : k(x −
xQ, t − tQ)kl∞ ≤ R
2 }, where cQ = (xQ, tQ) is the center of the cube. Given a constant α > 0
we deﬁne αQ to be the dilated by α of Q from its center, that is αQ = {(x, t) ∈ Rn+1 :
k(x − xQ, t − tQ)kl∞ ≤ α · R

Given a cube q ⊂ Rn+1 of size r we will use three functions that are highly concentrated
in q. The classic one is the characteristic function χc
q of q. We reserve the more standard
notation χq for the next object which is used more frequently. This is build with the help
of η0 (we abuse notation here as we should be using the corresponding η0 : Rn+1 → [0, +∞)
with similar properties):

2 }.

χq(x) = η0(

x − c(q)

r

).

This localization function has nice properties on the Fourier side. The other localization
function is

˜χq(x) = (1 + |

x − c(q)

r

|)−N ,

for some large N. This localization has better properties on the physical side.

2. Geometry of the surfaces and consequences

We start by simplifying the setup. The surfaces are bounded, therefore we can always break
them into smaller (and similar) pieces such as to accommodate the additional hypothesis
described bellow.

First we note that we can assume each Si to be of graph type: there is a smooth map
ϕi : Ui ⊂ Rn → R such that S = {Σi(ξ) = (ξ, ϕi(ξ)) : ξ ∈ Ui}. Here Ui are open, connected
with compact closure. It is less important that the graphs are of type ζn+1 = ϕi(ζ1, .., ζn) (we
can have as well ζk = ϕi(ζ1, .., ¯ζk, ..ζn+1)), although we can accommodate this by a rotation
of coordinates. Then each ﬂat leaf Si,α corresponds to a ﬂat leaf Ui,α, in the sense that
Σi(Ui,α) = Si,α; this is indeed the case since projections onto hyperplanes along a vector
transversal to Si takes 2-dimensional aﬃne planes to 2-dimensional aﬃne planes.

We can ﬁnd a system of coordinates xi : Rn → Rn that parametrizes each leaf Ui,α into a
new ﬂat leaf ˜Ui,α characterized by ξ3 = constant, .., ξn = constant. Finally, we assume that
each Ui has small enough diameter.

Next, we derive a key geometric consequence of our setup. Given a surface Si we deﬁne
Ni = {Ni(ζi) : ζi ∈ Si} be the set of normals at Si. By dspanNi we denote the following
subset of the classical span of Ni:

dspanNi = {αNα + βNβ : Nα, Nβ ∈ Ni, α, β ∈ R}.

dspanNi is the set of linear combinations of two vectors in Ni; it is not a linear subspace.
With these notation in place, we claim the following result.

Lemma 2.1. If S1, S2, S3 satisfy the conditions i)-iii), then for any N ∈ dspanN1 and any
N2 ∈ N2, N3 ∈ N3 the following holds true for all real numbers a, b, c:

(2.1)

|aN + bN2 + cN3| & max(|a||N|, |b|, |c|).

The statement is symmetric with respect to S1, S2, S3.

We note that the occurrence of |N| in max(|a||N|, |b|, |c|) is motivated by the fact that

vectors in dspanN1 are not normalized, but vectors in N2 and N3 are.

Proof. (2.1) is equivalent to a transversality condition between N, N2, N3:

vol(N, N2, N3) & |N|

We write N = αNα + βNβ for some Nα 6= Nβ and consider γ : [0, t0] → S1, a smooth curve
with the property that N1(γ(0)) = Nα and N1(γ(t0)) = Nβ. We also assume that |γ′(t)| = 1
on [0, t0] and that 0 ≤ t0 ≪ 1; this is possible because we assumed U1 of small diameter. In
addition, if α0 is such that γ(0) ∈ Si,α0, we can assume that γ′(0) ∈ (Tγ(0)S1,α0)⊥. Then we
have

N1(γ(t0)) = N1(γ(0)) +Z t0

0

SN1(γ(s))γ′(s)ds

= N1(γ(0)) + t0SN1(γ(0))γ′(0) + O(t2

0).

8

We then continue with

N = αN1(γ(0)) + β(N1 + t0SN1(γ(0))γ′(0) + O(t2
0)
= (α + β)N1(γ(0)) + βt0SN1(γ(0))γ′(0) + βO(t2
0)

The two vectors N1(γ(0)) and SN1(γ(0))γ′(0) are transversal, thus |N| ≈ |α+β|+t0|β||SN1(γ(0))γ′(0)|
(here we use that t0 ≪ 1), and also

vol(N, N2, N3) ≈ vol((α + β)N1(γ(0)) + βt0SN1(γ(0))γ′(0), N2, N3)

& |(α + β)N1(γ(0)) + βt0SN1(γ(0))γ′(0)| ≈ |N|

where we have used the following consequence of (1.2):

which holds true for any unit vector v ∈ (Tγ(0)S1,α0)⊥ ⊂ Tγ(0)S1.

(cid:3)

Using a similar argument as above, one can easily establish the following dispersive esti-

mate

(2.2)

|Ni(ζ1) − Ni(ζ2)| ≈ d(Si,α1, Si,α2)

where Si,α1, Si,α2 are the leafs to which ζ1, ζ2 belong to, respectively. Here the distance
between Si,α1 and Si,α2 can be deﬁned either by using geodesics inside the hypersurface
Si (using the induced metric from the ambient space Rn+1) or, equivalently, by using the
classical distance between sets in Rn+1.

3. Restating the problem

3.1. Rephrasing the problem in terms of free waves. We reformulate our problem
in terms of free waves, this being motivated by the use of wave packets in order to prove
Theorem 1.1. Once the wave packet decomposition is made and its properties of the packets
are clear, the formalization of the problem as an evolution equation can be forgotten.

Assume we are given a surface S with a graph type parametrization ζn+1 = ϕ(ξ) where
ξ = (ζ1, .., ζn). We rename the variable ζn+1 by τ , thus the equation of S becomes τ = ϕ(ξ).
We parametrize the physical space by (x, t) ∈ Rn × R. We make the choice that τ is the
Fourier variable corresponding to t, while ξ is the Fourier variable corresponding to x. In
what follows we use the convention that ˆf denotes the Fourier transform of f with respect
to the x variable.

We deﬁne the free wave φ = E f as follows

φ(x, t) = E f (x, t) =ZRn

ei(x·ξ+tϕ(ξ))f (ξ)dξ.

Note that φ(0) = ˇf and ˆφ(ξ, t) = eitϕ(ξ) ˆφ(ξ, 0). We deﬁne the mass of a free wave by
M(φ(t)) := kφ(t)k2

L2 and note that it is time independent:

M(φ(t)) := kφ(t)k2

L2 = k ˆφ(t)k2
L2 = k ˆφ(0)k2
The proof of (1.3) relies on estimating Π3
i=1Eifi on cubes on the physical side and see how
this behaves as the size of the cube goes to inﬁnity by using an inductive type argument
with respect to the size of the cube. Before we formalize this strategy, we note that at every
stage of the inductive argument we re-localize functions both on the physical and frequency

L2 = kφ(0)k2

L2 = M(φ(0)).

9

space, and, as a consequence, we need to quantify the new support on the frequency side.
This will be done by using the using the margin of a function.

We assume we are given a reference set V inside which we want to keep all functions

supported. If f is supported in U ⊂ V we deﬁne the margin of f relative to V by

margin(f ) := dist(supp(f ), V c).

In terms of free waves φ = E f , the margin is deﬁned by

margin(φ(t)) := dist(suppξ( ˆφ(t)), V c) = dist(supp(f ), V c),

where we have used that the Fourier support of ˆφ(t) is time independent and that ˆφ(0) = f .
In other words, the margin of a free wave is time independent.

In practice, we work with three diﬀerent types of free waves, φi = Eifi. They are assumed
to be graphs with diﬀerent phase functions ϕi and with potentially diﬀerent ambient domain,
that is Ui are subsets of diﬀerent subspaces isomorphic to Rn (for instance Ui can be subsets
of the hyperplanes ξi = 0). The above construction changes only in making the choice of τ
being the coordinate in the direction normal to the ambient hyperplane to which Ui belongs
to, while ξ are the coordinates in the ambient hyperplane. Obviously, the margin of each φi
is then deﬁned with respect to some Vi int the same ambient hyperplane. When choosing
the reference sets Vi we need to impose that the conditions i)-iii) hold true on Σi(Vi) as well.

Next, we prepare the elements that are needed for the induction on scale argument.

Deﬁnition 3.1. Let p(3) ≤ p ≤ 1. Given R ≥ C0 we deﬁne Ap(R) to be the best constant
for which the estimate

(3.1)

kΠk

i=1φikLp(QR) ≤ Ap(R)Πk

holds true for all cubes QR of size-length R, φi = Eifi and obeying the margin requirement

(3.2)

margini(φi) ≥ M − R− 1

4 , i = 1, .., k.

The goal is to obtain an uniform estimate on Ap(R) with respect to R. In the absence of
the margin requirement above, Ap(R) would be an increasing function. However, since the
argument needs to tolerate the margin relaxation, we also deﬁne

¯Ap(R) := sup
1≤r≤R

Ap(r)

and the new ¯Ap(R) is obviously increasing with respect to R.

Then (1.3), and as a consequence the main result of this paper, Theorem 1.1, follow from

the next result.
Proposition 3.2. Assume 0 < ǫ < 1. If R ≫ 22C0 and R− 1

3.2. Tables on cubes. Let Q ⊂ Rn+1 be a cube of radius R. Given j ∈ N we split Q into
2(n+1)j cubes of size 2−jR and denote this family by Qj(Q); thus we have Q = ∪q∈Qj(Q)q. If
j ∈ N and 0 ≤ c ≪ 1 we deﬁne the (c, j) interior I c,j(Q) of Q by

(3.4)

I c,j(Q) := [q∈Qj(Q)

(1 − c)q.

Given j ∈ N we deﬁne a table Φ on Q to be a vector Φ = (Φ(q))q∈Qj (Q) and deﬁne its mass
by

We deﬁne the margin of a table as the minimum margin of its components:

M(Φ) = Xq∈Qj(Q)

M(Φ(q)).

margin(Φ) = min

q∈Qj(Q)

margin(Φ(q)).

Inspired by the Lemma 6.1 in [22], we will make use of the following result.

Lemma 3.3. Assume 0 < p < ∞, R ≫ 1, 0 < c ≪ 1 and f smooth. Given a cube
QR ⊂ Rn+1 of size R, there exists a cube Q of size 2R contained in 4QR such that
(3.5)

kf kLp(QR) ≤ (1 + cC)kf kLp(I c,j(Q))

Proof. Using Fubini’s theorem, we have the following identity

ZQR

kf kp

Lp((QR∩I c,j(Q(x,t;2R)))dxdt =ZQR

From the deﬁnition of I c,j(Q(x, t; 2R)) it follows that

|f (x, t)|p|QR ∩ I c,j(Q(x, t; 2R))|dxdt.

|Q(x, t; 2R) \ I c,j(Q(x, t; 2R))| ≤ (n + 1)c|Q(x, t; 2R)| = (n + 1)2n+1c|QR|

11

and, as a consequence,

|QR| ≤ (1 + (n + 1)2n+1c)|QR ∩ I c,j(Q(x, t; 2R))|,

∀(x, t) ∈ QR.

In the above we have used that if (x, t) ∈ QR then QR ⊂ Q(x, t; 2R).

Combining this estimates with the above identity, leads to

kf kp

Lp ≤

(1 + (n + 1)2n+1c)kf kp

Lp((QR∩I c,j(Q(x,t;2R)))dxdt

1

|QR|ZQR

By the pigeonholing principle, it follows that there is (x, t) ∈ QR such that

kf kp

Lp ≤ (1 + (n + 1)2n+1c)kf kp

Lp((QR∩I c,j(Q(x,t;2R)))

and since (1 + (n + 1)2n+1c)
p aﬀects the choice of C.

p ≤ 1 + cC, the conclusion follows. Note that here the value of

4. Wave packets

The wave packet construction is standard by now. The key elements are: an interpre-
tation of the φ = E f as an evolution equation with initial data φ(0) = ˇf , a phase-spaces
decomposition of the initial data in a linear space and an analysis of the evolution of each
such component. The need of all these elements is the reason to require the more restrictive
hypothesis of graph-like foliation.

We now continue with the formalization of the wave packet construction for double-conical
surfaces. We assume that S is of double-conic type and it has the graph-type parametrization
Σ : U → S, where Σ(ξ) = (ξ, ϕ(ξ)) and with foliations U = ∪αUα, S = ∪αSα, Σ(Uα) = Sα.
For the foliation U = ∪αUα, we choose a system of coordinates x : U → ˜U such that for
each leaf Uα, the coordinates of Uα are ξ3 = constant, .., ξn = constant. Let ˜U ′ = π( ˜U ),
where π : Rn → Rn−2 is the projection π(ξ1, .., ξn) = (ξ3, .., ξn). Let ˜L be a maximal r−1-
separated subset of ˜U ′ ⊂ Rn−2. For each ˜ξ ∈ ˜L, x−1(·, ·, ˜ξ) is a leaf, that is x−1(·, ·, ˜ξ) = Uα
for some α. In each such leaf we pick ξT and call L to be the set obtained this way. It is
not important which ξT ∈ x−1(·, ·, ˜ξ) is chosen, since from condition ii) it follows that, for
ξ ∈ Uα, the normal N(Σ(ξ)) to S is constant as ξ varies inside the leaf Uα. We denote by
U(ξT ) the leaf Uα to which ξT belongs and by S(ξT ) = Σ(U(ξT )), the corresponding leaf on
S. We note that d(U(ξT1), U(ξT2)) ≈ d( ˜ξ1, ˜ξ2) which combined with (2.2) gives
(4.1)

|N(Σ(ξT1)) − N(Σ(ξT2))| ≈ d(U(ξT1), U(ξT2)) ≈ d( ˜ξ1, ˜ξ2).

Let L be the lattice L = c−2rZn. With xT ∈ L, ξT ∈ L we deﬁne the tube T = T (xT , ξT ) :=
{(x, t) ∈ Rn × R : |x − xT + t∇ϕ(ξT )| ≤ c−2r} and denote by T the set of such tubes. One
notices that T is the c−2r neighborhood of the line passing through (xT , 0) and direction
N(Σ(ξT )).

Associated to a tube T ∈ T , we deﬁne the cut-oﬀ ˜χT on Rn+1 by

˜χT (x, t) = ˜χD(xT −t∇ϕ(ξT ),t;c−2r)(x).

We are ready to state the main result of this Section.
Lemma 4.1. Let Q be a cube of radius R ≫ 1, let c be such that R− 1
J ∈ N be such that r = 2−J R ≈ R
each T ∈ T there is a free solution φT , that is localized in a neighborhood of size CR− 1

The above construction was provided for the case of conic surfaces (single-conic in our
context) in [22], and for more general surfaces in [2]. We sketch the main parts of the
argument. We start with the partition

Aξ

˜U ′ = [ξ∈ ˜L

where Aξ consists of the points in ˜U ′ that are closer to ξ than any other elements of ˜L.
Therefore Aξ belongs to the O(r−1) neighborhood of ξ.

Let G be the set of all translations in Rn−2 by vectors of size at most O(r−1); in particular
these translations diﬀer from identity by O(r−1). Let dΩ be a smooth compactly supported
probability measure on the interior of G. For each Ω ∈ G and ξ0 ∈ L, we deﬁne the Fourier
projectors by

For ﬁxed Ω ∈ G, this leads to the decomposition:

F (PΩ,ξ0g)(ξ) = χΩ(Aπ◦x(ξ0 ))(π ◦ x(ξ))ˆg(ξ).

(4.7)

PΩ,ξ0g.

g = Xξ0∈L

The terms above have good frequency support: PΩ,ξ0g is localized in frequency in a neigh-
borhood of size Cr−1 of U(ξ0); indeed, this follows from the deﬁnition of the sets Aξ, the
properties of Ω, the smoothness properties of x and the fact that π ◦ x(U(ξT )) = π ◦ x(ξT ).
We note the following: the sole reason for bringing in the additional coordinate map x
into the picture was to accommodate the simple group structure G used above; this is very
easy in the context of the ﬁbers x(Uα), or more precisely their projections π ◦ x(Uα) as one
simply uses the translations on Rn−2. At the original level of the ﬁbers Uα, this would be
more diﬃcult, but probably doable. For instance, for the classical conical model (1.4), one

13

assigns to each leaf Uα an angle ωα ∈ Sn−2 and can use the rotations in SO(n) that leave
the Sn−2 invariant to construct G. This is essentially the construction used in [22].

Now we proceed with the spatial localization. For each x0 ∈ L, deﬁne

ηx0(x) = η0(

c2
r

(x − x0))

and notice that, by the Poisson summation formula and properties of η0,

(4.8)

ηx0 = 1.

Xx0∈L

In Section 3.1 we interpreted φ = E f as an evolution with initial data φ(0) = ˇf . Based on
this, we deﬁne

and evolve this, at all other times, by the free ﬂow

φT (0) = ηxT (x)Z PΩ,ξT φ(0)dΩ

φT (t) = eitϕ(D)φT (0).

The statements (4.2)-(4.4) are standard in the wave packet theory, and they rely on the phase-
space localization properties of the initial data φT (0) and the properties of the ﬂow eitϕ(D);
the properties of the ﬂow eitϕ(D) are closely related to the geometry of the characteristic
surface S and in our particular case the key property is that in the support of ˆφT (0) we have
|N(Σ(ξ)) − N(Σ(ξ′))| . r−1 or, in terms of phase function, |∇ϕ(ξ) − ∇ϕ(ξ′)| . r−1. This
guarantees that the wave φT is highly localizes in the tube T . The details can be ﬁlled in
using similar arguments to those in [2, Lemma 4.1] or [22, Lemma 15.2].

Given that a statement of type (4.5) is less common in a wave packet decomposition, we
include a proof of it for convenience. This proof follows closely the one in [22, Lemma 15.2].
By using the unitarity of eitϕ(D) on L2, (4.5) is reduced to the corresponding statement at
time t = 0. We denote φ(0) = g and the left hand-side of (4.5) becomes

Given ξ1, ξ2 ∈ L, PΩ,ξ1PΩ( ˜Y )g and PΩ,ξ2PΩ( ˜Y )g have Fourier support in the sets x−1(Ω(Aπx(ξ1)\
˜Y )) and x−1(Ω(Aπx(ξ2) \ ˜Y )), respectively. The two sets Ω(Aπx(ξ1) \ ˜Y ) and Ω(Aπx(ξ2) \ ˜Y )
are at distance ≥ Cc2r−1 and the map x−1 may change this distance by a factor, that is the
distance between the sets x−1(Ω(Aπx(ξ1) \ ˜Y )) and x−1(Ω(Aπx(ξ2) \ ˜Y )) is ≥ Cc2r−1, after
redeﬁning C.

The functions ηx0 have Fourier support in the set |ξ| ≤ c2r−1, thus the Fourier supports of

ηx1PΩ,ξ1PΩ( ˜Y )g and ηx2PΩ,ξ2PΩ( ˜Y )g are also at distance ≥ Cc2r−1; recall that F (ηx1PΩ,ξ1PΩ( ˜Y )g) =
ˆηx1 ∗ F (PΩ,ξ1PΩ( ˜Y )g). The conclusion to draw from this is that if ξ1 6= ξ2, then ηx1PΩ,ξ1PΩ( ˜Y )g
and ηx2PΩ,ξ2PΩ( ˜Y )g have disjoint Fourier support. As a consequence, the term in (4.10) equals

5. Localization of the multilinear estimate

In [1] we established a reﬁnement of the generic trilinear restriction estimate under the
additional assumption of small support of one of the terms involved, see (5.3) below. In this
section we provide a slight modiﬁcation of this result which is needed for technical reasons.
We recall the setup from [1]. We are given 3 smooth hypersurfaces Si = Σi(Ui) with

smooth parameterizations Σi. We assume that there exists ν > 0 such that

(5.1)

vol(N1(ζ1), N2(ζ2), N3(ζ3)) ≥ ν,

for all choices ζi ∈ Σi(Ui). Here by vol(N1(ζ1), N2(ζ2), N3(ζ3)) we mean the volume of the
3-dimensional parallelepiped spanned by the vectors N1(ζ1), N2(ζ2), N3(ζ3).

Assume that Σ1(suppf1) ⊂ B(H, µ), where B(H, µ) is the neighborhood of size µ of the
3-dimensional aﬃne subspace H. Assume that |N1(ζ1) − πHN1(ζ1)| . µ, ∀ζ1 ∈ Σ1(suppf1),
where πH : Rn+1 → H is the projection onto H. In addition assume that if Ni, i = 4, .., n + 1
is a basis of the normal space H⊥ to H, then N1(ζ1), .., N3(ζ3), N4, .., Nn+1 are transversal in
the following sense:

(5.2)

|det(N1(ζ1), N2(ζ2), N3(ζ3), N4, .., Nn+1)| ≥ ν,

for all choices ζi ∈ Σi(Ui).

Under these hypothesis we proved that

There are few aspects in the above estimate that need to be highlighted. Switching from balls
of radius r to cubes of radius r makes no diﬀerence. The estimate says that inside q the main
contributions come from Eifi inside a dilate of q. This is simply a consequence of the ﬁnite
speed of propagation. The factor r− 3
2 exhibits an apparent improvement over (5.3). This is
explained by the fact that while in (5.3), the norms of Eifi are measured along hyperplanes, in
(5.4) the norms of Eifi are measured on cubes of size r and the additional dimension explains

16

the additional factors. Finally, the condition µ & r−1 is crucial in using the localization on
the physical side, without altering the localization at scale . µ of Σ1(suppf1).

i ∈ Σi(suppfi), Ni = Ni(ζ 0

To prove (5.4), we need to invoke the localization machinery developed in [1]. For each
i = 1, 2, 3 we ﬁx ζ 0
i ) and let Hi be the hyperplane on the physical
side passing through the origin with normal Ni. We denote by πNi the projection onto Hi
along Ni. Then, we choose a basis Ni, i = 4, .., n + 1 of the normal plane to H, let Hi be
the hyperplane on the physical side passing through the origin with normal Ni and denote
by πNi the projection onto Hi along Ni. The set {Ni}i=1,..,n+1 is a basis of Rn+1.

In each Hi, i = 1, 2, 3, we construct the set CHi(r) to be the set of n-dimensional cubes
of size r. For yi ∈ R, we deﬁne Hi + yiNi to be the translate of Hi by yiNi (in the normal
direction). Then CHi(r) + yiNi is the corresponding translate of CHi(r) by yiNi.

For i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, r > 0 and for a cube q ∈ Hi of radius r, we deﬁne χq : Hi → R by

χq(x) = η0(

x − c(q)

r

)

Notice that Fiχq has Fourier support in the ball of radius . r−1. This object is very similar
to the ones deﬁned in the Notation Section 1.1, the only diﬀerence is that they localize o
cubes living in diﬀerent linear spaces. By the Poisson summation formula and properties of
η0,

(5.5)

χq = 1.

Xq∈CHi(r)

Using the properties of χq, a direct exercise shows that for each N ∈ N, the following holds
true

for any g ∈ L2(Hi). Here, the variable x is the argument of g and belongs to Hi.

Now we can start the argument of for (5.4). Given any vector y ∈ Rn+1 with |yi − ci(q)| ≤

r, i = 1, 2, 3 and yi = ci(q), 4 ≤ i ≤ n + 1, we claim the following:

This gives the estimate (5.4). All that is left is the justiﬁcation of (5.7). We note that this
type of a posteriori improvement of the multilinear estimate was at the core of the arguments
in [1] and that, while (5.7) is not explicitly established there, its proof is essentially derived
along the same lines as (3.6) in that paper.

We ﬁrst note that, without restricting the generality of the argument we can assume that
c(q) = 0. Following the argument below, it will be clear that the proof for y = 0 extends to
the more general case when |yi| ≤ r, i = 1, 2, 3.

We ﬁx i = 1. In [1] we explained that the problem is reducible to the case when Σ1 : U1 ⊂
H1 → Rn+1 with Σ1(ξ′) = (ξ′, ϕ1(ξ′)) and suppf1 ⊂ B(H ∩ H1, µ), the µ neighborhood of
H ∩ H1 ⊂ H1. Then we have the representation

(5.8)

E1f (x1, x′) =ZU1

ei(x′ξ ′+x1ϕ1(ξ ′))f (ξ′)dξ′.

We highlight a commutator estimate which is needed due to the uncertainty principle. For
any ﬁxed x0 ∈ Rn+1, it holds true that

We have used the following: (5.9) in justifying the equality between the terms on the second
and fourth line, the induction hypothesis and the fact that inside Q we have |x1| . r to
justify the inequality in the sixth line (note that this part extends easily for more general y1

6. Table construction and the induction argument

This section contains the main argument for the proof of Theorem 1.1. In Proposition 6.1
we construct tables on cubes: this is a way of re-organizing the information on one term, say
φ1, at smaller scales based on information from one of the other interacting terms, φ2 or φ3.
This type of argument is inspired by the work on the conic surfaces of Tao in [22]. Based on
this table construction, we will prove the inductive bound claimed in Proposition 3.2.

Proposition 6.1. Let Q be a cube of size R ≫ 22C0. Assume φi = Eifi, i ∈ {1, 2, 3}
have positive margin. Then there is a table Φ1 = Φc(φ1, φ2, Q) with depth C0 such that the
following properties hold true:

(6.1)

(6.2)

φ1 = Xq∈QC0 (Q)

margin(Φ) ≥ margin(φ) − CR− 1

(6.3)
and for any q′, q′′ ∈ QC0(Q), q′ 6= q′′

2 (φi).

Remark 1. The above result is stated for scalar φ1, φ2, φ3, but it holds for vector versions
as well. Most important is that we can construct Φ1 = Φc(φ1, Φ2, Q) where Φ2 is a vector
free wave and all its scalar components satisfy similar properties to the φ2 above.

Remark 2. We note that Φ1 = Φc(φ1, φ2, Q) means that the table Φ1 is constructed from
φ1, which is natural in light of (6.1), and φ2. But it does not depend on φ3. Obviously, we
could have constructed it from φ1 and φ3, ending with a diﬀerent object.

Proof. There are several scales involved in this argument. The large scale is the size R of the
cube Q. The coarse scale is 2−C0R ≫ R
2 , this being the size of the smaller cubes in QC0(Q)
and the subject of the claims in the Proposition. Then there is the ﬁne scale r = 2−jR
chosen such that r ≈ R
2 . Notice that r is the proper scale for wave packets corresponding
to time scales R and also that their scale is c−2r ≪ 2−C0R, last one being the scale of cubes
in QC0(Q).

We use Lemma 4.1 with J = j to construct the wave packet decomposition for φ1,

For any q0 ∈ QC0(Q) and T1 ∈ T1 we deﬁne

φ1 = XT1∈T1

and

Based on this we deﬁne

By combing the deﬁnitions above with the decomposition property (4.2), we obtain

thus justifying (6.1).

The margin estimate (6.2) follows from the margin estimate on tubes provided by Lemma

4.1. The coeﬃcients mq0,T satisfy (4.6), thus the estimate (6.3) follows from (4.5).

All that is left to prove is (6.4), which is equivalent to

(6.6)

2 +ǫΠ3

i=1M(φi).

Xq∈Qj(Q):d(q,q0)&cR

Note that the cubes q are selected at the ﬁner scale dictated the size of cubes in Qj(Q).
From the deﬁnition of Φ(q0) in (6.5) we can discard the tubes q which do not intersect 4Q
based on (4.3), in the sense that their contribution to (6.6) will give a better estimate.

For the tubes intersecting 4Q, we make another simpliﬁcation motivated by (4.4) and

focus on the tubes which intersect q, that is we focus on the following term

Xq∈Qj(Q):d(q,q0)&cR

k XT1∩q6=∅

mq0,T1
mT1

φ1,T1φ2φ3kL1(q)

Essentially (4.4) says that the other tubes have oﬀ-diagonal type contribution, that is there
are enough gains in the case T1 ∩ q = ∅ to perform any summation. Note that in order to
keep the notation simple, we skipped writing T1 ∈ T1 and will do so throughout the rest of
this proof.

Using the localized form of the trilinear estimate (5.4), we obtain

Here we used that φ1,T1 is a free wave of type E1g1 (for some g1) that is localized in frequency
in the µ = r−1 neighborhood of the 2-dimensional aﬃne plane containing the leaf S1,α where
we choose the leaf such that Σ1(ξT ) ∈ S1,α.
If we add to the leaf the normal directions
N1(Σ(ξT )), we obtain a 3-dimensional aﬃne subspace H with the properties required to
invoke (5.4).

Using the obvious inequality mq0 ,T1

Next we claim the following estimate

(6.7)

mq0,T1 ˜χT1(xq, tq).k ˜χS(q)φ2k2

L2.

XT1∈T1

Using the deﬁnition of mq0,T1 we identify the function

˜χS(q) = (XT1∈T1

˜χ(xq, tq) ˜χT1)χq0

which makes (6.7) hold true. Then we note that ˜χS(q) has the following decay property:

˜χS(q)(x, t).c−4(cid:18)1 +

d((x, t), S(q))

c−2r

(cid:19)−N

.

Here the surface S(q) is the translate by c(q) of the neighborhood of size r of cone of normals
at S1, which we denote by CN 1 := {αN1(ζ), ζ ∈ S1, α ∈ R}. It is important to note that we
do not consider the whole cone but only the part with cR ≤ α.R. Then the estimate is a
consequence of the fact that the tubes T1 passing thorough q separate inside q0 and of the
separation between q and q0, which is quantiﬁed by d(q, q0) & cR. Quantitatively speaking,
given a point in q0 close to S(q), there are .c−4 tubes T1 passing through the point and q -
this follows from the dispersion estimate (4.1) and the geometry of the family of tubes T1.

Next we claim the following estimate:

Combing (6.8) with (6.7) gives (6.6) and this concludes the proofs of all claims of the Propo-
sition.

All that is left to prove is (6.8) and this can be broken down into the following two claims:

The proof of (6.10) is similar to the one we used in the bilinear theory, see the proof of the
corresponding theorem [2]. By rearranging the sum, it suﬃces to show

˜χq away from q, it suﬃces to show that

We deﬁne the following relation: q′ ∼ q if q′ ∩ S(q) 6= ∅ and note that this is equivalent
to saying that there is a tube T1 ∈ T1 intersecting both q and q′ and that d(q, q′) & cR. We

We are tacitly using again at this point the full dispersion property of the set of normals N1:
the tubes T1 passing through q separate inside q0; in the absence of this property, the above
inequality would fail, as we would encounter large number of tubes T1 ∈ T1 passing through
both q and q′.

At this point we use a wave packet decomposition for φ2 and φ3: we invoke again Propo-

sition 4.1, but this time with c ≈ 1. Using (4.4), we reduce (6.11) to the following

(6.12)

Xq Xq′∼q


 XT2∩q′6=∅

M(φT2)



 XT3∩q6=∅

22

M(φT3)

 .M(φ2)M(φ3).

Here we skip writing down that the sum run over T2 ∈ T2 and T3 ∈ T3 for keeping the
notation shorter and we will do so for the rest of the argument.

The key point in justifying (6.12) is that, as we vary (q, q′) with q′ ∼ q, the number
of occurrences of a pair of tubes (T2, T3) on the left hand-side is bounded by a universal
constant. Indeed, if that is the case we use (4.5) to obtain the bound

Xq Xq′∼q


 XT2∩q′6=∅

M(φT2)



 XT3∩q6=∅

M(φT3)

 . XT2∈T2 XT3∈T3

M(φT2)M(φT3).M(φ2)M(φ3).

We ﬁnish the argument by establishing an upper bound on the number of occurrences of
a pair of tubes (T2, T3) on the left-hand side of (6.12). Assume that a pair (T2, T3) shows
up multiple times. That means that there are (q, q′), (˜q, ˜q′) such that q ∼ q′, ˜q ∼ ˜q′ and
q′ ∩ T2 6= ∅, ˜q′ ∩ T2 6= ∅, q ∩ T3 6= ∅, ˜q ∩ T3 6= ∅. We tolerate repeated occurrences coming
from the setup d(q, ˜q) . r and d(q′, ˜q′) . r, which are bounded by a universal constant, but
rule out all the others.

Consider the case d(q, ˜q), d(q′, ˜q′) ≫ r. This implies the following:
c(q) − c(˜q) = α3N3 + O(r) for some N3 = N3(ζ3), ζ3 ∈ S3, |α3| ≫ r,
c(q′) − c(˜q′) = α2N2 + O(r) for some N2 = N2(ζ2), ζ2 ∈ S2, |α2| ≫ r,
c(q) − c(q′) = α1N1 + O(r), c(˜q) − c(˜q′) = ˜α1 ˜N1 + O(r), N1, ˜N1 ∈ CN |α1|, | ˜α1| ≫ r.
Since c(q) − c(q′) − (c(˜q) − c(˜q′)) = c(q) − c(˜q) − (c(q′) − c(˜q′)), this implies

α1N1 − ˜α1 ˜N1 = α3N3 − α2N2 + O(r)

Since α1N1 − ˜α1 ˜N1 ∈ dspanN1 we can invoke the result in Lemma 2.1 to obtain

|α1N1 − ˜α1 ˜N1 − α3N3 + α2N2| ≥ max(|α2|, |α3|) ≫ r

which is in contradiction with the previous statement.

The other two cases, d(q, ˜q) ≫ r, d(q′, ˜q′) . r and d(q, ˜q) . r, d(q′, ˜q′) ≫ r are ruled out in
a similar way: one notices that in the above proof we needed only one of coeﬃcients α2, α3
to have large absolute value.

(cid:3)

Proof of Proposition 3.2. Let φi = Eifi satisfying the margin requirements (3.2). Let QR be
an arbitrary cube of radius R. From Lemma 3.3 it follows that there is a cube Q ⊂ 4QR of

where we have used (6.3) in the last line. In using the induction-type bound on Π3
we are using the margin bounds on Φi from (6.2) to conclude with (3.2); this is easily seen
to be the case provided R is large enough to satisfy CR− 1

7. The optimality of p(k)

In this section we provide a generalization of the ”squashed-cap” construction from [11]
with the purpose of establishing the optimality of p(k). To keep things simple, we assume
that the surfaces are subsets of the Sn ⊂ Rn+1, the unit sphere in Rn+1, and moreover that

25

they are neighborhoods of the points ei; here ei = (0, .., 0, 1, 0, ..0) is the unit vector whose
coordinates are 1 on the i’th position and 0 elsewhere.

For each 1 ≤ i ≤ k, we construct the rectangular parallelepipeds
Di = {ζ ∈ Rn+1, |ζi − 1| < ǫ2, |ζj| < ǫ2, j = {1, .., k} \ {i}, |ζl| < ǫ, k + 1 ≤ l ≤ n + 1}.

We let Si = Sn ∩ Di and note that ei is transversal to Si. Thus Si can be easily parametrized
by Σi : Ui ⊂ {ζi = 0} → Si by

Σi(ζ1, .., ¯ζi, .., ζn+1) = (ζ1, .., ζi−1,q1 − ζ 2

1 − .. − ζ 2

i−1 − ζ 2

i+1 − .. − ζ 2

n+1, ζi+1, .., ζn+1).

Here, the set Ui is characterized by |ζj| < ǫ2, j = {1, .., k} \ {i}, ζi = 0, |ζl| < ǫ, k + 1 ≤ l ≤
n + 1. We pick fi = 1 on Ui, therefore

kfikL2(Ui) = |Ui|

2 ≈ (ǫ2(k−1)ǫn+1−k)

2 = ǫ

n+k−1

where |Ui| is the measure of Ui ⊂ Rn.

Next we consider the rectangular parallelepiped R ⊂ Rn+1 described by

Rc = {x ∈ Rn+1, |xi| ≤ cǫ−2, i = {1, .., k}, |xi| < cǫ−1, k + 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 1}.

Recall that

Eifi(x) =ZUi

eix·Σi(ξ)dξ.

By choosing c small enough so that |x · Σi(ξ) − xi| ≪ 1, for all ξ ∈ Ui, x ∈ Rc, it follows that

|Eifi(x)| & |Ui| ≈ ǫ2(k−1) · ǫn+1−k = ǫn+k−1, ∀x ∈ Rc.

Note that the smallness of c above is universal, and, most important, it is independent of ǫ.
Then we have

kΠk

i=1EifikLp & (ǫn+k−1)k|Rc|

p ≈ ǫk(n+k−1) · (ǫ−2kǫ−(n+1−k))

Then our results would imply

1

p = ǫk(n+k−1) · ǫ− n+1+k

p

which, by taking ǫ → 0, implies k(n+k−1)

ǫk(n+k−1) · ǫ− n+1+k
− n+k+1

p . ǫk· n+k−1
p ≥ 0, thus p ≥ 2(n+k+1)
k(n+k−1).

The above construction shows the optimality of p(k) in the case of subsets of the sphere
and it can be easily adapted to the case of the paraboloid. In fact, it seems to be relevant
for hypersurfaces with non-vanishing Gaussian curvature.

But this counterexample works the same way for multi-conical surfaces based on the
following simple observation: all that is needed is the consistency of scale ǫ in the ζk+1, .., ζn+1
directions with the ǫ2 scale in the normal direction at each piece; this is a consequence of
the quadratic character of the surfaces in the directions ζk+1, .., ζn+1. The details are left as
an exercise.
