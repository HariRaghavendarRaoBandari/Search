We consider dynamics of a ﬂat anisotropic Universe ﬁlled by a perfect ﬂuid near a cosmological
singularity in quadratic gravity. Two possible regimes are described – the Kasner anisotropic solution
and an isotropic “vacuum radiation” solution which has three sub cases depending on whether the
equation of state parameter w is bigger, smaller or equals to 1/3. Initial conditions for numerical
integrations have been chosen near General Relativity anisotropic solution with matter (Jacobs
solution). We have found that for such initial conditions there is a range of values of coupling
constants so that the resulting cosmological singularity is isotropic.

INTRODUCTION

Studies of quadratic gravity is an area of intense inves-
tigations during last several decades. Initial motivation
was to match gravity with quantum issues on semiclassi-
cal approach in a direct analogy with electromagnetism.
Today it’s well known that for suﬃciently strong ﬁelds,
electromagnetism, is accordingly modiﬁed, due to vac-
uum polarization of the fermion ﬁeld. The electromag-
netic ﬁeld is considered as a classical vector ﬁeld, and the
fermion ﬁeld is second quantized. This electromagnetism
was initially found by Heisenberg and Euler [1], and also
obtained by the method of Schwinger [2]. The result is a
non linear electromagnetic theory.

Subsequently it was developed by De Witt [3, 4] in the
context of a classically curved space time and a quantized
ﬁeld. The reason that it is known as the Schwinger - De
Witt technique, see for example [5, 6].

Much in the same way as in the electromagnetic theory,

GR is modiﬁed to a quadratic in curvature theory

which we will refer to as quadratic gravity (QG). A the-
ory without these counter terms is inconsistent from the
point of view of renormalization. Also the quadratic
terms in the curvature improve the degree of the superﬁ-
cial divergence of the theory. Anyway, as is well known,
the linearized degrees of freedom show a massless spin 2
ﬁeld, a massive spin 0 ﬁeld and a massive spin 2 ﬁeld that
has an energy with the wrong sign, see for example [7, 8].
The stability of the vacuum can be recovered at the ex-
pense of unitarity loss [9], which poses a major problem
on the quantized version of this gravitational theory.

† muller@ﬁs.unb.br

On the other hand, for a strictly classical theory, the
presence of a ghost is not so unacceptable. It only means
that there will be non linear instabilities, which we do
know that occur very often in nature. In this work, only
the classical version of the theory will be addressed, the
spirit is that it could well be an eﬀective theory valid for
some energy range.

Quadratic gravity was ﬁrst investigated by H. Weyl in
1918 [10], then it appeared again in the 60’s [11] through
Buchdahl’s seminal paper, followed by [12]. It was popu-
larized by Starobinsky in connection to inﬂation [13, 14].
For a good historical review see [15].

Since then it has been investigated by many authors
[16–28] It is worth to note that cubic and higher order
curvature corrections often lead to Big Rip singularity
even in the framework of f (R) theory [29–32] or at least
make important cosmological solutions unstable (for an
example beyond the f (R) theory see, for example [33]), so
our restriction with only quadratic curvature corrections
is justiﬁed from phenomenological reasons also.

In this work we are going to focus on the Kasner [34]
solution which is an exact solution for quadratic gravity.
The interest in this solution is that despite it is a vac-
uum solution, in GR it represent a past attractor for a
Bianchi I Universe ﬁlled by a perfect ﬂuid unless the stiﬀ
ﬂuid case (near a cosmological singularity “matter does
not matter”). Moreover, Kasner solutions are “building
blocks” for BKL chaotic approach to a singularity in more
general models like Bianchi IX mode [35]l. The study of
asymptotic solutions in quadratic gravity was previously
addressed, for example, by [36–39].

It was already known that the Kasner solution has a
zero eigenvalue [20] for quadratic gravity. The intention
of this work is to understand what happens with the so-
lution space near this zero eigenvector, and speciﬁcally at
the space time singularity. We assume that the Universe
is ﬁlled by a perfect ﬂuid and study how it approaches a
cosmological singularity. As the Kasner solution is not a
unique vacuum solution in quadratic gravity (see bellow)
the dynamics is not trivial.

The article is organized as follows. In section I a quick
review of expansion normalized variables is given. This
set of variables is used to write down the ﬁeld equations
in II. In III we discuss past attractors of this system. In
IV our initial conditions are speciﬁed. The section V con-
tains a detailed description of numerical results obtained.
The conclusions summarize our ﬁndings.

I. EXPANSION NORMALIZED VARIABLES

First of all, instead of the proper time s, ds = dt/H(t),
the dynamics is with respect to the dynamical time t,
which is dimensionless. This choice of lapse function,
and the meaning of H(t) will be made clear below.

An orthogonal non rigid base is used to deﬁne the vari-

ables

dt2
ds2 = −
H(t)2 + δijωi ⊗ ωj
δij = eµ
i eν
j gµν,

where the i, j indices refer to the spatial part and ωj is
the dual of ei, ωjei = δj
i. The metric gab is collectively
called

gab =

−H(t)−2 0 0 0
1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1

0

 .

For a timelike vector ua = (H, 0, 0, 0), uaua = −1, the
projection of the metric on the 3-space orthogonal to ua
is

hab = uaub + gab, hc

bgca = hab, hc

auc = 0,

as is very well known from standard textbooks. The co-
variant derivative can be written in its irreducible parts

∇aub = σab + ωab +
σab = u(a;b) −
ωab = u[a;b] + ˙u[aub]
˙ua = ub∇bua
θ = ∇cuc,

where as promised, the lapse function given in (2) is re-
lated to the expansion θ as

H =

(4)

For spatially homogeneous spacetimes, the timelike vec-
tor is geodesic ˙ua = 0 with zero vorticity ωab = 0, being
normal to the time slices. The temporal part of the con-
nection and the shear are related as

in this present work.

Metricity together with the condition for zero torsion
imply that the spatial part of the connection can be writ-
ten as

Γijk =

1
2 {γijk − γjik − γkij} ,

(8)

where γk
ijek = [ej, ei] is the commutator of the appropri-
ate base vectors for the group of motions under consid-
eration. The possible groups of motion are classiﬁed ac-
cording to the commutator, which give rise to all Bianchi
types [40].

In this present work, only strict zero spatial curvature
is going to be addressed, so that all commutators are
zero, which imply that all the purely spatial components
of the connection are null.

As usual, the Riemann tensor follows from the com-

mutator of the covariant derivatives

In this case the Jacobi identify is satisﬁed identically.

This is the anisotropic generalization of the ﬂat Fried-

mann model, for zero 3− curvature 3R = 0.

Let us emphasize that every Einstein space satisfying
Rab = gabΛ/2, with Tab = 0, is an exact solution of
(9). All vacuum solutions of Einstein’s ﬁeld equations
are also exact solutions of (1). In this present work, the
cosmological constant is set to zero.

Also, as a metric theory, the covariant divergence
∇cEca = 0. Any source that satisﬁes ∇cTca = 0 can

(2)

(3)

be consistently added in (9). The 00, E00 = 0 equation
is a constraint and is given in the Appendix B, while the
0i constraints E0i = 0 are identically satisﬁed. These
constraints are all dynamically preserved, and the E00
constraint is used to numerically check our result.

We will deﬁne the expansion normalized variables
(ENV) [40], ﬁrst in the context of Einstein’s GR for which
α = 0 and β = 0 in the ﬁeld equations (9). The shear σ±
and energy density T00 = ρ given respectively in (5) and
(9), are both divided by appropriate powers of H giving
the new variables Σ±, and Ωm
σ±
H
8πGρ
3H 2 .

Σ± =

Ωm =

(10)

In accordance to the tetrad chosen in (2) and the set of
variables, the source is

8πGTab = diag[3Ωm, 3wH 2Ωm, 3wH 2Ωm, 3wH 2Ωm].

(11)
The rest of the ENV are zero since we are restricting

to the Bianchi I case.

Thus for α = 0 and β = 0 the ﬁeld equations (9) reduce

to Einstein’s equations [41] with matter source

˙H = −(1 + q)H
˙Σ+ = −3Σ+ + (1 + q)Σ+
˙Σ− = −3Σ− + (1 + q)Σ−
1 = Σ2 + Ωm,

(12)

where Σ2 = σijσij/(6H 2) = Σ2

+ + Σ2

−, and

q =

1

2(cid:0)1 + 3Σ2 + 3wΩm(cid:1) .

The time evolution of the density parameter follow di-
rectly from the covariant divergence of (11) as [42]

˙H
H

˙Ωm = −2
Ωm − 3(w + 1)Ωm
˙Ωm = (2 + 2q − 3(w + 1))Ωm

(13)

Now we turn to the more general case for which α (cid:54)= 0
and β (cid:54)= 0. Besides the coordinates deﬁned in (10), there
will be higher derivatives, so that, following Barrow and
Hervik [20], these additional ENV are needed

According to their own deﬁnition, the following diﬀeren-

˙Σ±1 = Σ±2 − Σ±1Q1
˙B = −2Q1B
˙Q1 = Q2 − Q2

(15)

The dynamical system is deﬁned be equations (13), (15)
and the diﬀerential equations shown in the Appendix B.
We have redeﬁned the constant α in (1) as α = 3βχ.

so that B → 0 is a physical singularity.

III. PAST ATTRACTORS IN QUADRATIC

GRAVITY

In this section we describe possible past attractors. It
is useful to note that by inspection of the diﬀerential
equations in Appendix B it can be seen the presence
˙Q2 through the prod-
of Ωm only in the equation for
uct ΩmB. So that this product, could be irrelevant when
B → 0. In this regime the matter content decouples from
the evolution of the Universe, while its time evolution is
given by (13), as will become clear in section III A.

FIG. 1. In this orbit we choose χ = 3, β = 1.2, Ωm = 0.23,
φ = 2.43 and w = 0.7, the complete speciﬁcation of the initial
condition is given in Appendix A. The evolution of the system
is to the past and a) shows that the product ΩmB vanishes as
the singularity is approached while b) shows that Ωm diverges.
In the inset it is shown the product of the constraint by the
ENV B, E00B.

This means that all the results of Barrow and Hervik
[20] considering vacuum pure quadratic regime (B = 0)
hold also in the presence of matter and we can the use
results from this paper.

INITIAL CONDITIONS

4

Only backwards evolution is analyzed, in the sense that
the system evolves to a singularity, and as is known, there
are two solutions which are attractors to the past. As for
initial conditions, since the phase space of the system
under investigation is rather high dimensional, we need
some principle to ﬁx reasonable starting points of our
numerical integrations instead of trying to cover all pos-
sible initial conditions. That is why our initial condition
is chosen near a GR solution, in a sense that we will make
clear in the following. We stress that the initial value for
the density parameter Ωm is going to be related to the
amount of anisotropy, the closer Ωm is to 1 the smaller
the amount of anisotropy.

The general GR solution for Bianchi I and dust was dis-
covered independently by Robinson [43] and Heckmann
Shc¨ucking [44] and generalized to arbitrary equation of
state by Jacobs [45]. Strictly speaking, this is an exact
solution for GR, with equation of state p = wρ

H = (cid:0)α + m2τ 1−w(cid:1) w−1+w(cid:0)α τ w + 2 m2τ(cid:1)

3 τ (α τ w + m2τ )

α τ w + 2 m2τ
τ−1+wα sin(φ)τ
α τ w + 2 m2τ

Ωm = 4

Σ+ = −

Σ− = −

This is an exact solution of QG which was found by
Barrow and Hervik [20] and corresponds in the limit t →
−∞ to the ﬁxed point with the only non null variables

Q1 = −2
Q2 = 4.

It is a vacuum solution Tab = 0, that behaves as if it was
a strict GR universe ﬁlled with radiation p = ρ/3. The
eigenvalues together with the degeneracies are

22, 1 − 3w, 5, 4, 33, 12

So that it is an attractor to the past for w < 1/3.
In the opposite case this vacuum solution is a saddle.
Our numerical studies show that for the EOS parame-
ter w < 1/3, Ωm decreases towards the singularity, while
for w > 1/3, Ωm increases and ﬁnally diverges. FIG. 1,
shows a solution for which Ωm increases, although the
product ΩmB → 0. The latter fact explains why all
other variables have the same asymptotic as for vacuum
isotropic solution, since matter density enters equation
of motion only with this product. As these two asymp-
totics diﬀers only in the behavior of Ωm we will refer to
both of them as an isotropic solution in what follows.
Our numerics indicates also that for the particular case
of w = 1/3 the variable Ωm tends to some constant ﬁnite
value.

B. Kasner solution

where τ is related to the dynamical time t by,

This is also an exact solution of QG and in the ENV

coordinates it is is given by ΩΛ = 0,

B =

3e6t
β

Σ+ = cos φ
Σ− = sin φ,

where φ is a constant parameter. In this case the asymp-
totic t → −∞ it is also a ﬁxed point whose eigenvalues
and degeneracies are

9, 3 − 3w, 02, 66.

This solution is also an attractor to the past except for
these two zero eigenvalues. One zero eigenvalue appears
because we have in fact an one-dimensional set of equi-
librium points (the Kasner circle) marked by the param-
eter φ. The second zero eigenvalue indicates that the
ﬁxed points of this set are non-hyperbolic ﬁxed points
and their stability requires a special analysis. We will
see that in some situations they can be attractors.

t = − −2 w ln (τ ) + ln (τ ) + ln(cid:0)α τ w + m2τ(cid:1)

3(−1 + w),

the rest of the variables and the speciﬁcation of the initial
condition are presented in the Appendices.

As mentioned above, this solution is an exact solution
of GR with non zero source. Unless the EOS parame-
ter w = −1, it will not be a solution of quadratic grav-
ity. However, for suﬃciently big values of B the initial
condition is not so close to the singularity, the Universe
evolves according to GR and the quadratic terms behave
as a perturbation, locally in time. That is why we have
chose our initial conditions from which we integrate nu-
merically our system to be near Jacobs solution. Namely,
we choose all variable satisfying Jacobs solution except
for Q2 which is found from the constraint equation, E00,
shown Appendix B. The initial condition diferes from GR
only in higher time derivatives.

Remind that B → ∞ is a coordinate singularity, and
in order to correctly understand this regime, a diﬀerent
coordinate system should be chosen.

Stiﬀ matter, with equation of state w = 1, is also a GR

exact solution which is also a ﬁxed point

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS

A. Stiﬀ ﬂuid

In the case of stiﬀ ﬂuid the ENV of Jacobs solution
are constants, so we can formally start to integrate in
the pure quadratic regime with B = 0. This allows us
to use second order stability analysis of Kasner solution
made in [20]. Indeed, following this paper we can see that
the Kasner circle should be a saddle node ﬁxed point with
X → 0

˙X = X 2 + O(X 3)

where

X =(cid:18) 14 + χ

(Σ+2, Σ−2) = GΣ(cos φ, sin φ)
(Q1, Σ, F, G) = (−3 + x,−1 + y, 3 + z,−9 + ˜w).
Exact Kasner solution corresponds to x = y = z = ˜w =
0. Now we consider the initial condition speciﬁed in Ap-
pendix A. The limit in dynamical time t = −∞, corre-
sponds to τ = 0 for the GR solution shown in Appendix

which is zero, X = 0, for

χ = 4.

The initial condition is speciﬁed in the Appendix A, while
the value of B = 1/(3βH 2) is set up by equation (19) for
matching with the next subsection. We have checked that
the results are practically indistinguishable from those
with initial B = 0, so we do not present them separately.
In FIG. 2, we present a solution with the initial condition
for Ωm = 0.23. and coupling constant χ = 3. It can be
seen that this solution shown in FIG. 2 approaches the
isotropic singularity to the past.

FIG. 2. In this orbit we choose χ = 3, β = 1.2, Ωm = 0.23,
φ = 2.43 and w = 1, the complete speciﬁcation of the initial
condition is given in Appendix A, and in accordance to (19).
The evolution of the system is to the past and the solution
approaches the isotropic singularity to the past. In the inset it
is shown the product of the constraint by the ENV B, E00B.

In FIG. 3 we choose a diﬀerent value for the coupling
constant, χ = 6 while keeping all the other numerical val-
ues. In this case, it can be seen that the solution shown
in FIG. 3, approaches the Kasner solution to the past. In
FIG. 4 we show a grid of initial conditions, considering a
Universe initially ﬁlled with stiﬀ ﬂuid. It can be seen that
there’s a bifurcation at χ (cid:39) 4, for Ωm (cid:39) 0 which corre-

FIG. 3. In this orbit we choose χ = 6, β = 1.2, Ωm = 0.23,
φ = 2.43 and w = 1, the complete speciﬁcation of the initial
condition is given in Appendix A, and in accordance to (19).
The evolution of the system is to the past and the solution
approaches the Kasner singularity to the past. Again in the
inset it is shown the product of the constraint by the ENV B,
E00B.

FIG. 5. In this orbit we choose χ = 3, β = 1.2, Ωm = 0.23,
φ = 2.43 and w = −0.9. The evolution of the system is to the
past and the solution approaches the isotropic singularity, just
as FIG. 2

singularity.

FIG. 4. A grid of 100 × 100 for values of Ωm and χ with
β = 1.2, w = 1, φ = 2.43. The evolution of the system is to
the past and every black point corresponds to a solution that
approaches the isotropic singularity while the white points
approach Kasner solution. It can be seen that there’s a bifur-
cation at χ (cid:39) 4, for Ωm (cid:39) 0 which corresponds to an initial
condition near Kasner solution.

B. A general perfect ﬂuid

The intention of this subsection is to show that the
result is not much sensitive to the type of ﬂuid which we
initially choose to ﬁll the Universe. In FIG. 5 an initial
condition with a speciﬁc value of the coupling constant
χ = 3, while in FIG. 6 the value of χ = 0.9. Both
FIGS. 5 and 6 show that this universe has an isotropic
beginning after which anisotropies grow, and a solution
near Jacobs is obtained today.
It can be seen that in
FIGS. 5, 6 and 2 the asymptotic past of the Universe is
the isotropic singularity, so that the EOS parameter does
not inﬂuences much the behavior of the Universe near the

FIG. 6. In this orbit we choose χ = 3, β = 1.2, Ωm = 0.23,
φ = 2.43 and w = 0.9. The evolution of the system is to the
past and the solution approaches the isotropic singularity.

In FIG. 7 we show a bifurcation diagram for an initial
Universe near Jacobs solution with an EOS parameter
w = 0.5. Similar diagrams have been constructed for
other w in the range −1 < w < 1, they are all quali-
tatively the same. The value of the ENV B is initially
set to be very small, so FIG. 7 shows the behavior of the
universe very deep into the singularity. We have checked
also that the results do not change much for much bigger
initial B except for the case of extremly low matter den-
sity where some small changes have been detected. More
work will be needed to understand whether this is a real
efect of just a numerical instability.

Comparing to FIGS. 4 and 7, it can be seen that the
initial substance of which the Universe is made does not
inﬂuences the bifurcation value of χ.

becomes important is low enough, the Kasner circle is
still a future attractor. For bigger Ωm the solution tends
to the isotropic attractor. This value of matter density
which switches the nature of singularity from anisotropic
to isotropic one is a growing function of coupling constant
χ. We can also see that the boundary between these
two regimes in the initial condition space is sharp, so
apparently the dynamics has no chaotic properties.

Note also that the case of stiﬀ ﬂuid in quadratic gravity
is not exceptional in contrast to GR. In GR the relative
matter density of a stiﬀ ﬂuid does not disappear when
the Universe evolves towards singularity while Ωm → 0
for w < 1. In quadratic gravity the dynamics for w = 1
has no qualitative diﬀerence from the −1 < w < 1 case.

every black point corresponds to a solution that approaches

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In the present paper we considered cosmological dy-
namics towards a singularity in quadratic gravity for a
Bianchi I anisotropic Universe. Two important features
distinguishing quadratic gravity case from the GR analog
are:

• A new stable isotropic regime appears.
• Anisotropic Kasner solution looses a linear stability

becoming a saddle-node ﬁxed point.

For initial conditions which we use in the present pa-
per - those in the vicinity of Jacobs GR solution - the
dynamics near Kasner solution appears to be determined
by the value of coupling constant χ. Note, that assum-
ing that evolution of the Universe during preceding GR
era (on which quadratic terms can be considered as tiny
perturbations) is governed by Jacobs solution results into
a Universe which is very close to Kasner solution at the
beginning of a quadratic gravity epoch. For such initial
conditions and χ < 4 the Kasner circle appears to be un-
stable. Our numerical analysis shows that independently
of the relative amount of matter at the start of quadratic
gravity era, the solution tends to the isotropic attractor.
This also makes a chaotic attractor like BKL oscillations
for more general anisotropic models highly improbable
in quadratic gravity, though this issue requires further
investigations as we are restricted by Bianchi I model in
the present paper. Nevertheless, instability of Kasner so-
lution can be currently considered as a hint for instability
of BKL oscillations in quadratic gravity.

On the contrary, for χ > 4 for Jacobs initial conditions
the Kasner circle is locally stable. Numerical integrations
show that for such χ there are two types of dynamics. If
matter content at a period when quadratic contribution

The initial condition is chosen as follows. First, we ﬁx
a numerical value for the time τ = 1× 10−6. The closer τ
is to zero, the closer to the curvature singularity. Then,
as the parameter m can be chosen arbitrarily, we set it
as m = 1. The value of Ωm is used to set up the value of

the parameter α as

α = −2

m2τ
τ w +2

m2τ
Ωmτ w +2

m2(cid:113)−Ωmτ 2 (τ w)2 + τ 2 (τ w)2

Ωm (τ w)2

.

The numerical values of α, m, τ and w are substituted
back into (16) and the above equations (A1), except for
Q2 which is ﬁxed by the constraint E00 shown in Ap-
pendix B.
