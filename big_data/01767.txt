Abstract The proper motions of 15 nearby (d < 1 kpc) open clusters were recalculated
using data from the UCAC4 catalog. Only evolved or main sequence stars inside a certain
radius from the center of the cluster were used. The results differ signiﬁcantly from the
ones presented by Dias et al. (2014). This could be explained by the different approach to
taking the ﬁeld star contamination into account. The present work aims to emphasize the
importance of applying photometric criteria for the calculation of OC proper motions.

1 INTRODUCTION

Open clusters (OCs) are fundamental building blocks of spiral and irregular galaxies. Studies of galactic
OCs have produced a vast amount of important scientiﬁc results in areas such as stellar evolution and
star formation (Castellani et al. 2002; Phelps & Janes 1993). Furthermore, galactic OCs are crucial for
the understanding of the structure and dynamics of the Milky Way. Open clusters and OB associations
have been used to explore local structures (de Zeeuw et al. 1999; Torra et al. 2000) as well as the large-
scale structure of the galaxy (Bobylev & Bajkova 2014; Zhu 2008). They also help tracing the chemical
composition throughout the galactic thin disk (Magrini & Randich 2015).

Proper motion is a key parameter of open clusters. Proper motions, distances and radial velocities
are used to derive galactocentric velocities of OCs. The latter are of fundamental signiﬁcance in galactic
dynamics studies, e.g. determination of OC orbits (Wu et al. 2009) and rotation of the Galaxy (Dias
& L´epine 2005; Zhu 2007). Another important implication of OC proper motions is the calculation of
membership probabilities for individual stars (Sanders 1971; Cabrera-Cano & Alfaro 1985). It has been
shown that cluster parameters based on photometric membership probabilities are consistent with those
based on proper motion membership probabilities, see e.g. Wu et al. (2007).

The early history of open cluster proper motion determinations has been outlined by Vasilevskis
(1962). Up until the end of the 20th century proper motions of OCs were derived mainly on a case-
by-case basis. The ﬁrst large catalog was compiled by Glushkova et al. (1997), for 181 clusters with
log(age) < 8.3. Large OC proper motion catalogs were later released by Baumgardt et al. (2000) and
Dias et al. (2001, 2002) using Hipparcos and Tycho-2 data respectively. The results, obtained by Loktin

& Beshenov (2003) were also based on the Tycho-2 catalog, and are currently the ones cited in the
SIMBAD database.

The UCAC4 catalog (Zacharias et al. 2013) contains proper motion data for more than 105 mil-
lion objects (complete to R=16 mag). It compiles astrometric data from over 140 catalogs, including
Hipparcos and Tycho-2, for the derivation of mean positions and proper motions. The astrometry is
complemented by optical and NIR photometry from APASS and 2MASS. Dias et al. (2014) have used
UCAC4 to obtain proper motions for 1805 galactic OCs. We have recalculated the proper motions of 15
close (d < 1 kpc from the Sun) open clusters via a different method and obtained results, signiﬁcantly
different from the ones by Dias et al. (2014).

2 OBJECT SELECTION AND METHOD

The open clusters for this work were selected from the WEBDA list1 of close OCs (d < 1 kpc). Clusters
closer than 300 pc were not included as there should be systematic differences between the proper mo-
tions of their members, depending on location. We chose only prominent OCs, whose color-magnitude
diagrams (CMDs) present typical features for open clusters (main sequence, turnoff point). The selected
clusters are presented in Table 1.

Stars in the vicinity of each cluster were extracted by searching the UCAC4 catalog inside a given
radius from the cluster center. We used the same coordinates and radii of search as Dias et al. (2014).
A 2MASS (J − K) vs K diagram was built for each cluster. Out of all the N0 stars, N1 were selected
as very probable cluster members based on their location on the CMD. Only stars lying on the main
sequence (MS) or evolved ones, i.e. to the right from the MS and forming a feature along an isochrone,
were included in the N1 subselections (Fig.1). Data selection was carried out using Virtual Observatory
tools (Aladin2 and TOPCAT3).

Outlying points in the N1 subselections were removed using median absolute deviation (MAD),

deﬁned as:

M AD(x) = mediani(|xi − medianj(xj )|)
M AD(µ) = p(M AD(µαcosδ))2 + (M AD(µδ))2

The value of M AD(µ) was calculated for each cluster. Sources with proper motion differing by
more than 4M AD(µ) from the median proper motion were considered outliers and excluded from the
sample, thus producing even narrower subselections consisting of N2 stars. The proper motions of the
clusters were ﬁnally calculated by averaging the data in the N2 subselections.

3 RESULTS

Our results are presented in Table 2. The standard deviations of the proper motions in the N2 subselec-
tions are in the range of 0.8 mas/yr−4 mas/yr, which is comparable to the errors given by Dias et al.
(2014). However, the results differ signiﬁcantly from theirs (|∆µ| > 2 mas/yr for 9 of the 15 clusters).
Very large deviations are observed for NGC 7092, NGC 3532 and NGC 2422. Higher deviations from
Dias et al. (2014) are generally observed at higher absolute proper motion values (Fig. 2).

We suggest that Dias et al. (2014) may have used a large number of background stars, which could
have contaminated their selections. We attempted to estimate the percentage of those background stars.
For each cluster we examined 4 nearby ﬁelds, centered 40′ away (60′ away in the case of the larger
NGC 3532), and with radius rs, equal to the search radius for the cluster (Table 2). The median number
NF of UCAC4 sources in these 4 ﬁelds was then calculated. The portion of ﬁeld stars should be roughly
f = NF /N0. For all clusters f > 67%. The portion of ﬁeld stars among those used by Dias et al. (2014)
would be approximately fD = 1 − (1 − f )N0/ND. The minimum and median values of fD are 57%
and 75% respectively. Although this is just a rough estimate, it shows that a considerable portion of stars
used by Dias et al. (2014) are not physical members of the respective clusters.

Loktin & Beshenov (2003) have also applied photometric criteria for their selections. Our agreement
with the latter is slightly better in general (median |∆µ| of 1.6 mas/yr ) and much better in the case
of NGC 7092 (|∆µ| = 1.52 mas/yr and 17.08 mas/yr when comparing the data in Table 2 to Loktin &
Beshenov (2003) and Dias et al. (2014) respectively). The proper motion diagram for NGC 7092 (Fig. 1)
contains a considerable number of outlying points. The reason is that NGC 7092 is a very close cluster,
located near the galactic plane (Table 1). Most of the outliers are not in the N2 subselection and do not
affect the result as they lie farther than 4M AD(µ) from the median value.

4 SUMMARY

Proper motions are important parameters of open clusters, which help us improve our understanding
of galactic dynamics. We built NIR color-magnitude diagrams of 15 open clusters and we used them
to select stars that are very probable members. After excluding the ones with an uncommon proper

Fig. 2 Comparison of the calculated proper motions with the values by Dias et al. (2014)
(red circles) and Loktin & Beshenov (2003) (blue triangles). The x-axis represents absolute
proper motion values, calculated in this work, while the y-axis represents absolute values of
vector differences to the previous estimates. The Dias et al. (2014) data point for NGC 7092
lies outside the plot, at (|µ|, |∆µ|) = (18.18, 17.08).

motion, we used those subselections to calculate the proper motions of the clusters. Our results suggest
that Dias et al. (2014) may have used selections, contaminated by background stars. Our work shows
the advantage of utilizing CMDs for the calculation of open cluster proper motions.
