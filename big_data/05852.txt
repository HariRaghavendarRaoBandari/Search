A closer look at non-decoupling D-Terms

Theoretical Physics Department, CERN, Geneva, Switzerland

Florian Staub∗

Non-Decoupling D-Terms are an attractive possibility to enhance the tree-level mass of the stan-
dard model like Higgs boson in supersymmetric models. We discuss here for the case of a new
Abelian gauge group two eﬀects usually neglected in literature: (i) the size of the additional ra-
diative corrections to the Higgs mass due to the presence of the new gauge coupling, and (ii) the
impact of gauge kinetic mixing. It is shown that both eﬀects reduce to some extent the positive
eﬀect of the non-decoupling D-terms on the Higgs mass.

INTRODUCTION

The discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) [1, 2] completes not only the the stan-
dard model (SM) of particle physics, but gives also new
constraints to any extension of it. The most studied ex-
tension of the SM is still supersymmetry (SUSY), see
Ref. [3, 4] and references therein. However, the minimal-
supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) has become un-
der a lot of pressure in the last years. On of the reasons
is the measured Higgs mass of 125 GeV which is not triv-
ial to accommodate in the MSSM: for the tree-level mass
h ≤ MZ holds, and
of the Higgs the strict upper limit mT
one needs therefore large radiative corrections to push
the mass to the desired value. The two main possibilities
within the MSSM are either heavy stops, and/or a large
mixing among them. The ﬁrst option rises immediately
the question about naturalness[5], while the second one
might cause charge and colour breaking minima [6–8].
These issues have increased a lot the interest in non-
minimal SUSY models in the last years. A widely studied
approach to soften the need for large radiative corrections
to the Higgs mass is to increase it already at tree-level.
This is done for instance in diﬀerent singlet extensions
via F -terms [9–15]. The other option is to use D-terms
[16–18].
The simplest realisations of these ideas show the expected
decoupling behaviour: as soon as the new sector respon-
sible for the enhanced tree-level mass becomes heavy, the
positive eﬀect of the Higgs mass shrinks. However, it has
been shown that this decoupling can be circumvented
for the price of introducing large soft-breaking masses.
Indeed, valid models with non-decoupling F - [19–21] or
D-terms [22–26] were successfully constructed.
We will consider in this letter the case of non-decoupling
D-terms via a new Abelian gauge group U (1)X. So far,
only the leading order eﬀect on the Higgs mass was stud-
ied for this case: the impact of the non-decoupling D-
terms at tree-level in the case of vanishing gauge kinetic
mixing. We will show that (i) radiative corrections and

∗ ﬂorian.staub@cern.ch

(ii) the presence of gauge-kinetic mixing can give impor-
tant corrections to this approximation.
This letter is organised as follows:
in section II a short
excursion into gauge kinetic mixing in supersymmetric
models is given, before in section III the origin of both
eﬀects in a concrete model is described. The impact on
the Higgs mass is analysed numerically in section IV, be-
fore we summarise in section V.

II. GAUGE KINETIC MIXING IN

SUPERSYMMETRIC MODELS

If more than one Abelian gauge group is present, mix-
ing terms between the ﬁeld strength tensors of the groups
are allowed by gauge and Lorentz invariance [27]:

Here, F µν are the ﬁeld strength tensors of two diﬀerent
Abelian groups A, B and κ is in general an n×n matrix if
n Abelian groups are present. For practical applications
it is often useful to bring the propagators of the vector
bosons back into their canonical form by the redeﬁnition
[28]

V → κ1/2V .

(2)

The trade-oﬀ for this redeﬁnition is a change in the co-
variant derivative:
∂µ − iQT

˜GV → ∂µ − iQT

(3)

−1/2V ,

˜Gκ

where ˜G is the original diagonal matrix of n individual
gauge couplings associated to the n Abelian gauge fac-
tors, and Qi is the vector of the relevant U (1) charges.
Thus, the κ−1/2 factor can be translated into a new set of
2 n(n−1) “eﬀective” gauge couplings whose combinations

populate oﬀ-diagonal entries of a gauge-coupling matrix

G ≡ ˜Gκ

In supersymmetric models, gauge kinetic mixing appears
not only for the vector bosons, but also for the the D-
terms and in the gaugino soft-breaking terms. Of par-
ticular importance in the following are the new D-terms

while the non-Abelian D-terms keep the standard form.
For the special case of two Abelian gauge groups, the
most general form of G reads

(cid:19)

G =

(6)

In general, one has the freedom to perform a change
in basis to bring G into a particular form. The most
commonly considered cases are the symmetric basis with
gXY = gY X = ˜g and the triangle basis with ˜g = gXY ,
gY X = 0. The triangle basis has the advantage that
the new scalars do not contribute to the electroweak
VEV, and the entire impact of gauge kinetic mixing is
encoded in one new coupling ˜g. The relations between
gij (i, j = X, Y ) and the physical couplings called gY ,
gX, ˜g are given by [29]

For simplicity, we will neglect in the following λ, MS,

In addition, the
soft-breaking term of ξ can always be shifted away. The
relevant soft-breaking terms in the scalar sector are

with ϕ = {Hd, Hu, η, ¯η, S}.
Electroweak symmetry breaking and the breaking of

III. A MODEL FOR NON-DECOUPLING

D-TERMS

A. The Higgs mass at tree-level

In order to show the impact of loop corrections and
gauge kinetic mixing on the Higgs mass in the presence
of non-decoupling D-terms, we take a model inspired by
Ref. [26] as example1. In this model, the particle content
of the MSSM is extended by a gauge singlet superﬁeld
ˆS, a superﬁeld for the right-handed neutrino and two
ﬁelds ˆη,ˆ¯η responsible for the breaking of U (1)X, which
are uncharged under the SM gauge group.
It has also
been shown that this model, when extended in addition
by three generations of vector-like leptons and quarks,
provides an attractive explanation for the diphoton ex-
cess observed at 750 GeV by ATLAS and CMS [30]. The

Thus, we have the D-term enhancement for very large
soft-terms, which is, however, modiﬁed by the presence
of the oﬀ-diagonal gauge coupling ˜g.

B. The running of gauge kinetic mixing

Of course, as long as ˜g is small, the impact of gauge
kinetic mixing will be negligible. Thus, as long as ˜g is
treated as free parameter, it can be set to zero at a given
scale. However, via renormalisation group eﬀects (RGE)
it will be induced radiatively if the two Abelian gauge
groups are not orthogonal. Orthogonality in this respect
means that the anomalous dimension matrix deﬁned by

16π2γab = TrQaQb

(16)

is diagonal. Here, a and b run over all U (1) groups and
the trace runs over all superﬁelds charged under the cor-
responding group. In many commonly studied U (1) ex-
tension as GSM × U (1)B−L, γ is not diagonal [31]. Even
if the two Abelian groups can be embedded in a singlet
GUT group, gauge kinetic mixing might appear for the
remaining light decrease of freedom [32–34]. Calculat-
ing the anomalous dimension matrix for the model under
consideration, one ﬁnds large oﬀ-diagonal entries as well:

16π2γ = N

N

(17)

N is a vector containing the GUT normalisation. Since
we don’t assume any GUT embedding here, we use N =
(1, 1) in the following. At the one-loop level one can
calculate the value of ˜g at the SUSY scale as function
of (i) the scale Λ where ˜g is assumed to vanish and (ii)
the value for gX at this scale. The running of the gauge
coupling matrix G at one-loop is given by [35, 36]

β(1L)
G = GGT γG

(18)

(cid:32)

(cid:33)

One has to keep in mind to bring G to the particular
basis deﬁned in eq. (7) after the running. The result is
shown in ﬁg. 1 One ﬁnds that ˜g is in general negative, and

only for a very low cut-oﬀ Λ the new coupling ˜g is much
smaller than gX. For Λ = 106 GeV and large gX, |˜g| can
already be as large as 0.1, while for a GUT motivated
scenario with Λ (cid:39) 1016 and gX (Λ) = 0.72, ˜g can even be
as large as 0.4–0.5×gX

2.

C. Loop corrections

Because of the non-vanishing charge of the Higgs dou-
blets under the new gauge group, many additional ra-
diative contributions to the Higgs mass arise already at
one-loop. The Feynman diagrams with possible contribu-
tions proportional to gX are depicted in ﬁg. 2. Since the
right-sfermions carry also a U (1)x charge, they give also
non-vanishing diagrams at one-loop. However, it can be
shown that the tadpole and self-energy corrections cancel
exactly for them. The loop corrected scalar masses are
the eigenvalues of the radiatively corrected mass matrix
m2,(1L)

given by

2 Even if for small values of ˜g the impact on the Higgs mass might
be not important, gauge kinetic mixing can still have very impor-
tant, phenomenological consequences for instance for Z(cid:48) searches
[37, 38] or dark matter properties [39].

the new force changes the relation between the measured
SM parameters and the running DR values which enter
the loop calculations. The most important parameter in
this respect is the top Yukawa coupling Yt. As it can be
seen from ﬁg. 4, the change in the running coupling Y DR
is only very small when turning up gX. Thus, the change
in the loop corrections is only very tiny.

which have dimensions up to 8 × 8. Thus, most contri-
butions can only be calculated numerically. Only for the

timate for the impact on the SM-like Higgs mass which is
mainly given by the change in the (2,2)-element of ∆M 2:

Q2 is the renormalisation scale and we used the limit
p2 → 0. In order to give still an impression of the impor-
tance of all other loop corrections, we group all diagrams
in four sets: (i) diagrams involving only neutralinos ( ˜χ0),
(ii) diagrams involving only neutral CP-even scalars (h),
(iii) diagrams involving only charged Higgs scalars (H +),
(iv) diagrams with CP-odd scalars, the new gauge boson
and the corresponding ghost (A0, Z(cid:48), η(cid:48)). One has to
consider the ﬁelds in the last group together, to have a
gauge invariant set of diagrams. In ﬁg. 3 we show the val-
ues of the corrections to the (2,2)-element of the Higgs
mass matrix as function of gX for the case of vanishing
kinetic mixing, MZ(cid:48) = 3 TeV and m¯η = 2 TeV. One can
see that the corrections from neutralinos and the one Z(cid:48)
together with its Goldstone and ghost are comparable
small. The main loop corrections come from the charged
and CP-even scalar sector. Since both are negative, one
can expect that the new loop corrections reduce the SM-
like Higgs mass, i.e.
they might compensate to some
extent the positive eﬀect at tree-level.

There is also an indirect eﬀect of the extended gauge
sector on the MSSM-like corrections to the Higgs mass:

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

We turn now to the discussion of the impact on the SM-
like Higgs mass of the two eﬀects described in the last sec-
tion. For this purpose, we make use of the SPheno [40, 41]
output of SARAH [42–47]: the SARAH generated Fortran
code provides a full ﬂedged spectrum generator for the
model which enables a calculation of the entire mass spec-
trum at one-loop without any approximation: any loop

cluded. In principle, SPheno includes also new two-loop
corrections for the model under considerations [48, 49].
However, these are so far only available in the gaugeless
limit, i.e. the corrections we are mainly interested in are
not covered.
We show in ﬁg. 5 the shifts of the SM-like Higgs mass at
tree-level and at the one-loop level for M(cid:48)
Z = m¯η = 3 TeV
in the (gX , ˜g/gX )-plane compared to the case gX = ˜g =
0. One sees that the enhancement in the Higgs mass when

are shown as function of gX and for diﬀerent combina-
tions of MZ(cid:48) and m¯η. One ﬁnds, that the loop eﬀects
always reduce the overall enhancement of the Higgs mass
by 25–30%. The radiative corrections are usually more
important for small gX, but also depend to some extent
on the hierarchy between MZ(cid:48) and m¯η:
for larger m¯η,
what corresponds to a bigger enhancement at tree-level,
the relative importance of the loops drops faster with
increasing gX.

V. SUMMARY

We have revisited here the possibility to push the tree-
level mass of the SM-like Higgs by non-decoupling D-
terms.
It has been shown that a pure study at tree-
level can overestimate the positive eﬀect on the Higgs
mass signiﬁcantly: new radiative corrections triggered by
the extended gauge sector can reduce the Higgs mass by
several GeV. In addition, it has been shown that also
gauge kinetic mixing, which is a natural eﬀect if the new
Abelian gauge group is not orthogonal to U (1)Y , reduces
the positive shift of the Higgs mass at tree-level to some
extent depending on the assumed cut-oﬀ scale Λ.

including loop eﬀects and/or gauge-kinetic mixing is al-
ways smaller than the push at tree-level when neglecting
these eﬀects. Assuming a ﬁxed ration ˜g/gX, gauge ki-
netic mixing becomes more important for larger gX. In
contrast the (relative) impact of the loop corrections has
only a mild dependence on the considered value of gX.
