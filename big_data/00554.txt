Abstract

Photon modes have an important role in characterizing the quantum sources of

light. Proper coupling of various photon modes obtained in spontaneous para-

metric down conversion (SPDC) process in optical ﬁbers is essential to generate

an eﬀective source of entangled photons. The two main pre-detection factors

aﬀecting the biphoton mode coupling in SPDC are the pump beam focusing pa-

rameter and the crystal thickness. We present the numerical and experimental

results on the eﬀect of pump focusing on conditional down-converted photon

modes for a Type-I BBO crystal. We experimentally verify that biphoton cou-

pling eﬃciency decreases asymptotically with pump beam focusing parameter.

We attribute this behaviour to (a) the asymmetry in the spatial distribution of

down-converted photons with the pump beam focusing parameter and (b) the

ellipticity of biphoton modes introduced due to the focusing of the pump beam.

We also show experimentally the ellipticity as well as quantify the asymmetry

with the pump focusing parameter. These results may be useful in selecting op-

timum conditions in the down-conversion process for generating eﬃcient sources

of entangled photons for quantum information applications.

1. Introduction

Spontaneous parametric down conversion is one of the most popular methods

used to generate heralded single photons as well as entangled photon pairs [1].

In this second order non-linear optical process, a pump photon of higher energy,

when interacting in a non-linear medium, down-converts to two lower energy

photons.

It is governed by the conservation laws of energy and momentum.

The momentum conservation is apparently called as phase matching condition

[2]. Photon pairs that are entangled in diﬀerent degrees of freedom such as

polarization [3, 4, 5] and orbital angular momentum [6] are experimentally real-

ized using SPDC process. In recent years, multiple SPDC setups are extensively

used for generating multipartite entangled states [7, 8]. Due to applications in

quantum teleportation [9], quantum cryptography [10], quantum metrology [11]

and super dense coding [12], there is an increased demand of eﬃcient single

photon and entangled photon sources.

There have been many theoretical studies on eﬀective ﬁber coupling of SPDC

sources of photons [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. The main parameters that

control the collection eﬃciency of photon pairs are thickness of the crystal used

for down-conversion, spatial walk-oﬀ, and mode ﬁeld diameter of the optical

ﬁbers eﬀectively imaged onto the crystal plane [13]. Coupling of SPDC photons

with single-mode and multi-mode ﬁbers were investigated [14, 15] as a function

of pump beam diameter, crystal thickness and walk-oﬀ. Signiﬁcant changes

were observed in the coupling of SPDC photon pairs to the single-mode and

multi-mode ﬁbers while varying the pump beam diameter. It was analytically

shown that the coincidence spectrum becomes inseparable under strong pump

focusing conditions [16]. It has been claimed that the important parameters for

mode coupling in collinear parametric down conversion are the photon wave-

length, the focal length of lens and the ﬁber diameter [17]. Similar work has

been carried out for quasi-phase matched crystals, but coupling was investigated

by considering the down-converted output as a classical beam [18]. Dependence

of photon coupling ratio on focusing parameter of pump and collection modes,

2

and the crystal length in the case of periodically-poled crystals has been studied

[19] with an emphasis on grating defects. The theoretical framework of Ben-

nink [20] shows that the optimum focusing conditions for maximum eﬃciency of

collinear PDC are precisely same as that of sum frequency generation and para-

metric ampliﬁcation using Gaussian beams. On the contrary, Smirr et. al. have

shown that there is no signiﬁcant change in the coupling eﬃciency of conditional

biphoton modes with the focusing parameter, under collinear phase-matching

conditions [21, 22].

Here, we study the eﬀect of pump focusing on biphoton coupling eﬃciency

of photon pairs obtained in a non-collinear SPDC process experimentally. We

observe that the coupling eﬃciency decreases asymptotically with the focusing

parameter of the pump beam. We give theoretical explanation on how crystal

thickness inﬂuences the behaviour of biphoton modes in pump focusing. We also

give a physical reason for this decrease in coupling eﬃciency using the matching

of conditional optical modes of down-converted photons, which has not been

addressed earlier. We show that a loosely focused pump beam and a thin crystal

are the best pre-detection conditions for the eﬀective ﬁber coupling of entangled

photons, as the former reduces the eﬀect of SPDC ring asymmetry and the later

reduces the walk-oﬀ eﬀects inside the crystal. We also verify that the role of

collection mode diameter on mode coupling to the ﬁbers is more signiﬁcant in

tight pump focusing than in loose pump focusing.

2. Theory of SPDC: Semi-classical treatment

In the multi-mode perturbative treatment of SPDC, we consider the electric

ﬁeld of a pump beam as classical and the down-converted photons as quantum.

Their respective electric ﬁelds can be written as [23]

In general, each parametric down conversion process can be characterized by

a joint two-photon mode function of momentum and frequency, which is derived

from the quantum state of down-converted output as given in Eqn. 4 [25]. The

mode function gives the information about the process such as pump beam

characteristics and crystal phase matching conditions. Using mode function, we

can quantify spatial and spatio-temporal correlations among the down-converted

modes without actually doing the state tomography [25]. The mode function

has a one-to-one correspondence with the coincidence counts that we measure in

experiment. A typical two-photon mode function [26] in transverse momentum

3. Mode coupling techniques in SPDC

Better sources of single photons by parametric down-conversion require the

eﬃcient coupling of optical modes involved in the process, into the ﬁber. Be-

fore coupling, the down-converted photons are spatially and spectrally ﬁltered.

The functions that represent the spatial and frequency ﬁltering (ωc) of down-

converted photons are given by

mode coupling, ﬁrst we deﬁne a reference mode by imaging the single mode

ﬁber-coupled idler photons onto the crystal. i.e., we project them into a single

mode Gaussian.

The overlap of these two conditioned modes is what we call mode matching.

where the equality is achieved for perfect mode matching.

4. SPDC with focused pump

Here we study the eﬀect of pump focusing on mode coupling eﬃciency. A

focused Gaussian pump beam is characterized by a focusing parameter ξp [22],

given by

6

ξp =

L

kpw2
p

(13)

where kp is the magnitude of wave vector for the pump beam, L is the crystal

thickness and wp is the pump beam waist located inside the crystal. A ﬁeld-

based photon collection eﬃciency is given by

χsi =

Csi√
CsCi

(14)

where Csi is the measure of overlap of all the three modes - the correlated

biphoton mode with the signal mode and the idler mode. While Cs & Ci are the

measures of overlap between the correlated biphoton mode and a single mode. In

experiment, Csi turns out to be the coincidence counts and Cs, Ci are the singles

count of signal and idler respectively. In terms of focusing parameters of pump

and the diameter of the collection (signal & idler) modes, the coupling eﬃciency

for a degenerate parametric down conversion under thin crystal approximation

can be rewritten as [14]

χsi =

4L(kpξpw2
(kpξpw2

0 + L)
0 + 2L)2

(15)

where kp is the magnitude of wave vector of the pump mode and w0 is the

diameter of each target modes. The numerical plot of mode coupling eﬃciency

vs pump focusing for diﬀerent collection mode diameters (w0) is given in Fig.

1. For a ﬁxed value of focusing parameter, the coupling eﬃciency is more for

smaller collection mode diameter. This behaviour is more pronounced in the

loose focusing region (ξp ¡ 0.1).

A crude estimation of the eﬀective crystal length (Lef f ) along which down-

conversion takes place is given in [28]. This eﬀective crystal length depends

on the pump focusing parameter, the orientation of propagation vectors of the

down-converted photons with respect to the pump beam, and the collection

mode diameter (w0). This is used to distinguish the behaviour of biphoton

mode in diﬀerent crystal length regimes [29]. In short crystal regime (L ¡ Lef f ),

7

ent collection mode diameters.

the biphoton mode is completely determined by the pump properties, i.e. the

crystal length eﬀects can be neglected. In the long crystal regime (L ¿ Lef f ),

the biphoton mode depends on the pump as well as the crystal properties.

5. Experimental details

The experimental setup used to verify the above theoretical arguments is

given in Fig. 2. Here, we have used a UV diode laser (Toptica iBeam smart)

of wavelength 405 nm and power 300 mW with a spectral band width of 2 nm,

to pump the non-linear crystal, Type-I β-Barium Borate (BBO), of thickness
2 mm and transverse dimensions of 6 mm×6 mm with an optic axis oriented
at 29.97◦ to the normal incidence. The combination of a polarizer and a half
wave plate allows us to vary the pump beam polarization along the crystal

axis. A plano-convex lens is used to focus the pump beam inside the crystal

kept at the focal plane. For changing the focusing parameters, plano-convex

lenses of focal lengths 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 & 750 mm are used in our

experiment. The down-converted photons (signal & idler) of wavelength 810 nm

the SPDC ring. The images of the down converted ring for diﬀerent focusing

conditions were taken using an Electron Multiplying CCD (EMCCD) camera
(Andor iXon3) of 512×512 pixels with a pixel size of 16×16 µm2.

To measure the number of photon pairs generated, two diametrically oppo-

site portions of the SPDC ring at a given plane were selected using apertures

(A) and the photons coming out of each aperture were collected using the ﬁber

collimators FC1 & FC2 (CFC-5X-B, Thorlabs) of focal lengths 4.6 mm and a nu-

merical aperture of 0.53. The ﬁber collimators are attached to the single mode

ﬁbers (P1-780A-FC-2, Thorlabs) each having a numerical aperture of 0.13 and a
mode ﬁeld diameter of 5±0.5 µm, which inturn are connected to the single pho-
ton detectors D1 & D2 (SPCM-AQRH-16-FC, Excelitas). The detectors have a

timing resolution of 350 ps with 25 dark counts per second. Two interference
ﬁlters (IF) of passband 810±5 nm are kept very close to the ﬁber collimators
to make sure that other unwanted wavelengths are properly ﬁltered out. To

measure the number of correlated photon pairs, the two detectors are connected

to a coincidence counter (CC), IDQuantique-ID800, having a time resolution of

81 ps.

Results and Discussion

To study the eﬀect of pump focusing on biphoton modes, ﬁrst we study

the eﬀect of asymmetry present in the angular distribution of down-converted

photons obtained for diﬀerent focusing parameters. For this, we image the ring

of down-converted photons using an Electron Multiplying CCD camera. These

focusing parameters (ξp) corresponding to focal lengths f =100, 150, 200, 300, 600 & 750 mm

respectively.

images are shown in Fig. 3 corresponding to the diﬀerent pump focusing pa-

rameters obtained by focusing the pump beam on to the crystal using diﬀerent

plano-convex lenses of focal lengths 100, 150, 200, 300, 600 & 750 mm. The

inhomogeneity in the spatial distribution of the down-converted photons de-

creases with decrease in the pump focusing parameter, i.e. with the decrease in

the focal length of the lens used to focus the pump beam.

In order to quantify the asymmetry of a ring formed by the down-converted

photons, we introduce an asymmetry factor (AF ), which is deﬁned as

AF = 1 − b

down-converted ring (a ¿ b) as shown in the inset of Fig. 4. The asymmetry

factor is calculated for diﬀerent focusing parameters of the pump beam and

shown in Fig. 4. We found that the asymmetry increases with the increase in

focusing parameter i.e. when we move from loose focusing to tight focusing of

the pump beam. Also, we observed that the asymmetry is independent of the

propagation of down-converted photons from the crystal plane and depends on

the crystal tilt in a known fashion [29]. The variation of asymmetry factor is

linear with respect to the focusing parameter. To study the inﬂuence of the

crystal chosen (L=2 mm), we calculated the eﬀective crystal length (Lef f ) [28]

for each values of pump focusing parameter used in the experiment. Under
tight focusing condition (ξp > 0.1), Lef f is ∼12.3 mm and for loose focusing
condition (ξp < 0.1), it is ∼13.9 mm. So, the range of pump focusing parameters
we considered in the experiment were found to satisfy the condition L < Lef f

[29], i.e. the inﬂuence of crystal length on the asymmetry in the SPDC ring is

negligible when compared with that of the pump focusing parameter.

For coincidence detection, we choose two diametrically opposite portions of

11

Because of the asymmetry of SPDC ring, the photon number densities (number

of photons per unit area) of signal and idler in the selected areas are diﬀerent

due to which we are not able to select all the signal photons that correspond to

the selected idler photons. This accounts for the asymptotic decrease in mode

coupling eﬃciency of down-converted photon pairs with pump focusing.

Figure 5: (Colour online) EMCCD image of a ring of down-converted photons. For coincidence

counting setup, the two diametrically opposite points of the ring (shown in blue circles) are

selected.

Now, in order to see how the diﬀerence in photon number densities of signal

and idler aﬀect the conditional coincidence images of down-converted photons,

we recorded the conditional spatial distribution of signal photons under two

extreme pump focusing conditions, i.e. loose pump focusing (Fig. 6(a), (b)) and

tight pump focusing (Fig. 6(c), (d)). To image conditional biphoton modes, the

ﬁber collimators (FC1 & FC2) kept in signal and idler arms were mounted on XY

translational stages. The ﬁber collimator in the idler arm was adjusted to get

maximum individual counts and ﬁxed. Then the ﬁber collimator in the signal

arm was moved manually along X & Y directions with a step size of 1 mm. A

total of 400 and 900 spatial points were considered in the scanning in loose pump

focusing and tight pump focusing cases respectively. The individual as well as

the coincidence counts were recorded for each array point. Figures 6 (a), (b) and

any lens. (c) Numerical and (d) experimental plots of the conditional spatial distribution of

signal photons under tight focusing condition of the pump beam, here ξp=0.832 obtained

using a lens of focal length f =50 mm.

6 (c), (d) show the numerical and the corresponding experimental results for

the conditional coincidence imaging under both the conditions. The numerical

results are obtained by plotting the density plots of normalized conditional signal

mode function described by the Eqn. (9), for loose and tight pump focusing

conditions respectively. It is clear from the ﬁgure that the experimental results

are in good agreement with the numerical simulations. We also observe that

the overlap extent of conditional signal and idler modes decreases under tight

focusing condition as one of the conditional modes becomes elliptic for a given

idler coupled in a single mode ﬁber.

In observing the eﬀect of pump focusing on biphoton modes, we tried to

quantify the degree of overlap between conditional signal and idler modes in

down-conversion and its variation with pump focusing parameter. For this, we

calculated the biphoton mode coupling eﬃciency (χsi) for diﬀerent pump beam

to the mismatch of the numerical aperture of ﬁber collimator (FC) and single

mode ﬁber used for the experiment. To calculate the focusing parameter of

the pump beam, we calculated the beam diameter at the focus. The diameters

of two collection modes projected onto the crystal are calculated as w0=456

µm. We observed an asymptotic decrease in coupling eﬃciency with the pump

focusing parameter, which matches with the theory of single mode ﬁber coupling

of down-converted photons given in [14]. From the numerical plot given in Fig.

1, it is clear that the inﬂuence of collection mode diameter is nominal under

condition (ξp < 0.1). From the graphs, one can also observe that the coupling

eﬃciency is higher for the loose focusing than the tight focusing, which is also

clear from our experimental results given in Fig. 7. In our experiment, we used

the same crystal length and collection mode diameter in order to study the eﬀect

of focusing on the coupling eﬃciency. We observe that the coupling eﬃciency

mainly depends on the overlap of two conditional modes and the asymmetry

present in the ring of down-converted photons.

7. Conclusion

We have studied the eﬀect of pump beam focusing on photon pair coupling

eﬃciency of signal and idler in Type I non-collinear spontaneous parametric

down conversion. We have experimentally veriﬁed that the conditional coupling

eﬃciency of the down-converted modes into a single mode ﬁber varies asymp-

totically with the pump beam focusing parameter. This behaviour is attributed

to the the asymmetry in the spatial distribution of down-converted photons

with the pump beam focusing parameter, due to which the conditional modes

of down-converted photons become elliptic. From our observations, we conclude

that a loosely focused or almost collimated pump beam inside a thin crystal is

the best pre-detection scenario for an eﬃcient ﬁber coupled source of entangled

photon pairs. These mode coupling techniques will be very useful in gener-

ating better sources of entangled photons for diﬀerent quantum information

techniques [30].
