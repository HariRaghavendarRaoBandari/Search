ABSTRACT

It has been suggested that hot stellar wind gas in a bow shock around an exoplanet
is suﬃciently opaque to absorb stellar photons and give rise to an observable transit
depth at optical and UV wavelengths. In the ﬁrst part of this paper, we use the CLOUDY
plasma simulation code to model the absorption from X-ray to radio wavelengths by
1-D slabs of gas in coronal equilibrium with varying densities (104 − 108 cm−3) and
temperatures (2000 − 106 K) illuminated by a solar spectrum. For slabs at coronal
temperatures (106 K) and densities even orders of magnitude larger than expected for
the compressed stellar wind (104 − 105 cm−3), we ﬁnd optical depths orders of magni-
tude too small (> 3× 10−7) to explain the ∼ 3% UV transit depths seen with Hubble.
Using this result and our modeling of slabs with lower temperatures (2000 − 104K),
the conclusion is that the UV transits of WASP-12b and HD 189733b are likely due to
atoms originating in the planet, as the stellar wind is too highly ionized. A corollary
of this result is that transport of neutral atoms from the denser planetary atmosphere
outward must be a primary consideration when constructing physical models. In the
second part of this paper, additional calculations using CLOUDY are carried out to
model a slab of planetary gas in radiative and thermal equilibrium with the stellar
radiation ﬁeld. Promising sources of opacity from the X-ray to radio wavelengths are
discussed, some of which are not yet observed.

1 INTRODUCTION

Exoplanet transits observed at broadband optical wave-
lengths probe relatively dense gas in the planet’s atmosphere
(e.g. Charbonneau et al. 2002; Charbonneau et al. 2007).
By contrast, radiative transitions for abundant species and
with large cross sections may probe more rareﬁed regions
at much larger radii (e.g. Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003a). Ab-
sorption well before or after the broadband optical transit
implies optically thick absorbing gas at large distances from
the planet (e.g. Llama et al. 2011; Lai, Helling & van den
Heuvel 2010). Recent observations of asymmetry in transit
lightcurves (e.g. Fossati et al. 2010; Haswell et al. 2012; Ben-
Jaﬀel & Ballester 2013), speciﬁcally an early ingress, point
toward an enhanced density of absorbers on the leading side
of the planet.

There are several space-based observations of transit
light curves exhibiting an early UV ingress. An early UV
ingress on WASP-12b was observed based on 5 data points
from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS ) onboard the
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the NUVA (253.9–258.0

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS

nm) near-UV wavelength region (Fossati et al. 2010). Ad-
ditionally, Haswell et al. (2012) observed an early ingress
on WASP-12b in the NUVC (278.9 – 282.9 nm) near-UV
wavelength region caused by Mg II and the NUVA region
using an additional 5 data points from COS on HST. Se-
quential HST COS observations of WASP-12b by Nichols
et al. (2015) combined the data from the NUVA, NUVB
(265.5 – 271.1 nm), and NUVC wavelength regions and also
found an early ingress. The data from Haswell et al. (2012)
and Nichols et al. (2015), however, are noisy. They observed
absorption before the start of the optical transit but never
observed a pre-transit baseline. Interpretations of the ob-
servations become more diﬃcult if you include all the data
points and do not exclude certain data points (see ﬁg 5 in
Haswell et al. 2012). Follow-up observations of WASP-12b
using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph instrument
(wavelength range from 290.0–570.0 nm) on HST (Sing et al.
2013) resulted in a non-detection of a timing diﬀerence.
There was also a reported early ingress on HD 189733b in
the C II 133.5 nm line using COS on HST (Ben-Jaﬀel &

2

Turner et al.

Ballester 2013). However, these authors call for additional
observations and caution that the detection could have been
caused by unknown systematics.

There are two main models for explaining the origin
of an early ingress – magnetic (Vidotto, Jardine & Helling
2010, 2011a,b; Vidotto et al. 2011; Llama et al. 2011, 2013)
and non-magnetic (Lai, Helling & van den Heuvel 2010;
Bisikalo et al. 2013a; Bisikalo et al. 2013b) – which we
will now describe. A planet traveling supersonically through
the ambient coronal medium will form a bow shock. An
early ingress can result if the bow shock is leading the
planet and the compressed post-shock material in the mag-
netosheath becomes suﬃciently opaque, absorbing the back-
ground starlight. The transit depth will then become a func-
tion of the geometry of the post-shock layer and the chem-
istry therein (Llama et al. 2011, 2013). Ignoring thermal
and ram pressure, the approximate location of the magne-
topause1 is found assuming pressure balance between the
planetary magnetic ﬁeld and the stellar wind magnetic ﬁeld
(Vidotto, Jardine & Helling 2011a). This type of bow shock
will be referred as a magnetic bow shock in the rest of
the paper. Thus, assuming that the stellar magnetic ﬁeld
is known, that the thermal and ram pressures are negligi-
ble, and that the stellar wind gas is opaque enough to cause
detectable absorption, constraints on the planet’s magnetic
ﬁeld can in principle be made by observing diﬀerences be-
tween ingress times in diﬀerent wavelengths. The reason this
eﬀect is thought to occur in the UV is not entirely under-
stood and is one area of investigation for this paper. Vidotto,
Jardine & Helling (2011a, hereafter VJH11a) presented a
magnetic bow shock model that they applied to all transit-
ing exoplanets and predicted that UV ingress asymmetries
should be common in transiting exoplanets and tabulated a
list of the 92 targets that should exhibit this eﬀect.

A model ignoring magnetic ﬁelds has recently been pro-
posed to explain the WASP-12b HST observations (Bisikalo
et al. 2013a; Bisikalo et al. 2013b; see also Lai, Helling &
van den Heuvel 2010). These authors perform hydrodynamic
simulations in 3-D and looked at the interaction between the
stellar wind and the escaping planetary atmosphere. In or-
der to ﬁnd the stand oﬀ distance from the planet, the stellar
wind ram pressure was balanced by pressure from the plane-
tary gas assuming negligible contribution from the planetary
and the stellar wind magnetic ﬁeld (Bisikalo et al. 2013a).
This type of bow shock will be referred to as a non-magnetic
shock in the paper. Gas leaving the L1 point is bent forward
in the orbit by the Coriolis force, leading to a distribution of
gas leading the planet. As with the VJH11a model, the exact
absorbing species in the non-magnetic bow shock that can
cause an early ingress is unknown and is also investigated in
this paper.

While both the magnetic bow shock theory and initial

Rp is the radius of the planet, Bp is the planetary magnetic ﬁeld

netic ﬁeld strength at the surface of the star, a is the semi-major
axis of the planet, and R∗ is the radius of the star (Vidotto, Jar-
dine & Helling 2011a). Both the star and the planet magnetic

observations focused on the UV, a recent study by Cauley
et al. 2015 opens up the possibility of applying the VJH11a
magnetic bow shock model to other wavelengths. Cauley
et al. 2015 observe an asymmetric transit in HD 189733b
using HiRES on Keck I in the hydrogen Balmer lines. These
authors apply the magnetic bow shock model to their obser-
vations by balancing the planetary magnetic ﬁeld pressure
with the stellar wind pressure assuming negligible contribu-
tion from the stellar magnetic ﬁeld.

Furthermore, there are extensive near-UV observations
from the ground looking for asymmetries due to bow shocks.
Absorption is thought to be observable in ground-based
observations because the spectral region covered by the
ground-based near-UV observations and at least one of the
HST NUVA, NUVB, or NUVC ﬁlters include strong reso-
nance lines (e.g. Ne I, Na I, Mg I, Al I, Mn I, Fe I, Co I,
Ni I, Cu I; Morton 1991, 2000; Sansonetti 2005) and lots
of lines from ionised abundant elements (e.g. Ne III, Na II,
Cl II, Ca II, Ca III, Sc II, V II, Cr II, Mn II, Fe II, Co II,
Ni I, Cu II, Cu III; Morton 1991, 2000; Sansonetti 2005).
However, near-UV ground-based broad-band (303–415 nm)
photometry observations of 19 exoplanets (including WASP-
12b) have all resulted in non-detections (Southworth et al.
2012; Pearson, Turner & Sagan 2014; Turner et al. 2013;
Bento et al. 2014; Copperwheat et al. 2013; Zellem et al.
2015; Turner et al. in press) despite the prediction by Cop-
perwheat et al. (2013) that an early ingress could be seen in
these ﬁlters. The ground-based broad-band photometry non-
detections might imply that the coronal material does not
absorb suﬃciently strongly at the observed wavelengths, the
absorption of speciﬁc spectral lines being diluted by using
broad-band ﬁlters, or one of the requirements presented by
VJH11a for a stable bow shock detection not being satisﬁed
(Turner et al. 2013; Pearson, Turner & Sagan 2014; Vidotto
et al. 2015; Turner et al. in press). Our study will shed light
onto the correct interpretation of the ground-based observa-
tions.

In this study we investigate all known UV opacity
sources by performing a detailed radiative transfer, chem-
ical, and ionization analysis of the coronal plasma environ-
ment in the bow shocks around close-in exoplanets using the
plasma simulation code CLOUDY (Ferland et al. 2013). This
modeling will test the basic assumption of VJH11a that the
stellar wind is suﬃciently opaque to cause the early transit
ingress. We do not, however, consider the opacity from a
population of energetic atoms which arise due to charge ex-
change reactions between “cold” atoms from the planet and
“hot” stellar wind protons (Holmstr¨om et al. 2008; Trem-
blin & Chiang 2013). Additionally, we model with CLOUDY
the planetary gas in thermal and ionization equilibrium with
the stellar radiation ﬁeld to determine what species may be
observable. The overview of the CLOUDY modeling can be
found in § 2 and the results and discussion for the coronal
gas and planetary gas can be found in § 3 and § 4, respec-
tively.

2 OVERVIEW OF CLOUDY

CLOUDY is a widely-used plasma simulation code designed to
simulate the ionization, chemical, and thermal state of an
astronomical plasma exposed to an external radiation ﬁeld

and to predict its emission and absorption spectra (Ferland
et al. 2013; Ferland et al. 1998). It accounts for the entire
electromagnetic spectrum from hard X-rays to the radio and
includes the 30 lightest elements in its calculations. By de-
fault, the abundances of these elements are assumed to be
solar but this can be changed. CLOUDY self-consistently bal-
ances all ionization, excitation, and microphysical (e.g. in-
ner shell ionization and charge exchange) rates for all con-
stituents (Badnell et al. 2003; Bryans et al. 2006). For the
ionic and molecular emission data, CLOUDY uses the CHIANTI
database (version 7: Dere et al. 1997; Landi et al. 2012), the
LAMDA database (Sch¨oier et al. 2005), and its own Atomic
and Molecular Database (STOUT; Lykins et al. 2015). All
known spectral lines are taken into account from these three
databases and level energies are from NIST when available
(Kramida et al. 2014). A thorough description of STOUT can
be found in Lykins et al. (2015). The program has been thor-
oughly tested and can be used for number densities up to
1015 cm−3 and temperatures from 3 K to 1010 K (Ferland
et al. 2013). Additionally, all CLOUDY modeling performed in
this study is done in 1-D.

The two main choices for the equilibrium condition en-
forced by CLOUDY are thermal and coronal equilibrium. In
coronal equilibrium, the temperature is ﬁxed and the col-
lisional ionization rate is set by the gas temperature and
ionization potentials of all the constituents. Photoionization
also occurs in coronal equilibrium if an external radiation
ﬁeld is speciﬁed. Heating and cooling are not necessarily
in equilibrium for the coronal case. The level populations
are then determined by balancing all the relevant processes.
In thermal equilibrium, the temperature of the slab of gas
(cloud) is determined by the balance of cooling and heating
of the gas.

3 MODELING OF THE CORONAL GAS WITH

CLOUDY

For the CLOUDY modeling, we simulate the output spectrum
and transit depth in the conditions of the shocked stellar
coronal gas in the magnetosheath. The spectrum used is
the net transmitted spectrum by summing the attenuated
incident and diﬀuse continua and lines2.

A brief description of the geometry of the bow shock
(Figure 1) and the simpliﬁed geometry used for the CLOUDY
modeling (Figure 2) can be found below. A bow shock will
form if the relative velocity between the planetary and the
stellar coronal material is supersonic and will lead the exo-
planet if the star’s rotational period is greater than planet’s
orbital period (as is the case for most close-in exoplanets;
VJ11a). The upstream region is composed of three regions of
interest: the bow shock, the magnetosheath, and the magne-
topause. In this paper we adopt magnetospheric terminology
for the shock geometry; however, this geometry applies gen-
erally to any planet with a bow shock not just magnetic
ones. The magnetosheath is the area of compressed coro-
nal material and has a width of ∆rm. The magnetopause
is the boundary between the magnetosphere and surround-
ing plasma from the stellar wind. Inside the magnetopause,

to scale). The stand-oﬀ distance, rM , is determined by balancing
the planetary magnetic ﬁeld pressure with the ram pressure from
the stellar wind. ∆rM is the region of compressed stellar coronal
material. This geometry also applies to non-magnetic bow shocks.

the plasma is assumed to be composed predominantly of gas
from the planet (See §4.2). The stand-oﬀ distance, rM , is de-
termined by balancing the planetary magnetic ﬁeld pressure
with the ram pressure of the stellar wind. For the CLOUDY
modeling, we model the magnetosheath as a cloud with a
width of 2∆rm and a covering factor equal to Ω/4π (Figure
2). This approximation to the cloud width is chosen as a sim-
pliﬁcation of the 3-D structure of the bow shock since pho-
tons along the line of sight go through the magnetosheath
twice. The covering factor is the fraction of 4π sr covered
by the cloud, as viewed from the star (the central source of
radiation) and represents the fraction of the radiation ﬁeld
emitted by the star that actually strikes nebular gas. The
line luminosities and intensities are the main characteristics
that depend on the covering factor. The solid angle of the
cloud as viewed from the central star is

where rm is the magnetospheric radius. Using Equation 1,
we ﬁnd a covering factor of 0.0011 for rm = 4.4 Rp, assum-
ing a planetary magnetic ﬁeld (Bp) of 4 G, and 0.0034 for
rm = 8.0 Rp, assuming a Bp of 30 G (Lai, Helling & van den
Heuvel 2010). Since the strength of the planetary magnetic
ﬁelds are not known, we use a covering factor of 0.0034 in
order to be conservative in testing weather the total absorp-
tion is substantial enough to explain the observations.

We ran CLOUDY3 in an open geometry and in coronal

equilibrium assuming a constant temperature of 1 × 106 K
(see description below about why this is a good assump-
tion), a nominal magnetosheath width (∆rm) of 0.24 RJup
(Llama et al. 2011), an orbital distance (a) of 0.023 au (the
orbital distance of WASP-12b; Hebb et al. 2009), and a solar
metallicity ([F e/H]) for the cloud (Table 1). The external
radiation ﬁeld was a solar spectrum taken from stitching to-
gether data from the TIMED-SEE (Woods et al. 2000) and
SORCE (Anderson & Cahalan 2005) satellites (Figure 3).
We then varied the hydrogen density (nH ) in the cloud be-
tween 104 − 108 cm−3 and calculated the output spectrum.
In order to correctly interpret the CLOUDY results it is im-
portant to note that nH is the density of hydrogen nuclei,
irrespective of their form (protons, bound atoms, molecules).
All the elements are scaled relative to nH based on their so-
lar abundances.

We explain below our choice of the parameter range
explored for the hydrogen densities. The expected stellar
wind density at the planet may be estimated as nH (cid:39)
10 cm−3(1 AU/a)2 = 104 cm−3 (0.03 AU/a)2 by scaling
the density of the solar wind as measured near Earth as
1/a2 with separation a from the star (this proﬁle is an ap-
proximation to the actual stellar wind proﬁle measured for
the sun; McKenzie, Axford & Banaszkiewicz 1997). Hence
the lower limit of the density range explored is thought to be
the actual value around a solar-type star. The upper limit
nH (cid:39) 108 cm−3 is an estimate of the density at the base
of the solar corona (Withbroe 1988), the highest density
expected for coronal gas. Since the base of the corona is
at a ∼ 1.001R(cid:63), and the planets considered here orbit at
a ∼ 3 − 9 R(cid:63), the planets are expected to be orbiting in
an environment with density much smaller than the coronal
base density. These densities are consistent with those found
by Vidotto, Jardine & Helling (2010) and VJH11a for an
hydrostatic isothermal corona (see table 1 in VJH11a). The
actual stellar wind density at WASP-12b and HD189733b
are not known but should be within the limits explored in
this study. Assuming the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions for
a γ = 5/3 gas, we only expect a maximum increase of 4 in
the plasma density across the bow shock between the stellar
wind and magnetosheath.

The temperature of the shock is one of the most impor-
tant parameters in our modeling, therefore, we discuss our
choice of shock temperature and the assumptions we use in
greater detail below. A shock temperature is adopted that is

comparable to that of the solar coronal gas (T = 106K; As-
chwanden 2005) and subsequently we vary the speciﬁc choice
of temperature in a parameter study (Section 3.1). Previous
works have posited that the post-shock gas, while initially
hotter due to compression (increased by the square of the
Mach number), undergoes radiative cooling to reach tem-
peratures in the range of 104 to 105 K (Lai, Helling & van
den Heuvel 2010; Vidotto, Jardine & Helling 2010). No at-
tempts are made, however, to estimate whether this degree
of cooling is realistic. To determine whether our adopted
shock temperature is a reasonable assumption we compare
the cooling rate of the gas to the dynamical time. Suther-
land & Dopita (1993) ﬁnd that for gas with temperatures on
the order of 106 − 107 K, the cooling rate is approximately
10−22nen erg cm3 s−1 where n is the total density of nuclei
and ne is the number density of electrons. The characteris-
tic cooling time tcool for gas with energy density E and a

is applied since the output spectrum from CLOUDY does not
account for the size of the magnetosheath or the star4. In
models of the bow shock incorporating more geometric so-
phistication (e.g., Llama et al. 2011), the absorption due to
the bow shock occurs primarily in a thin sliver at the lead-
ing edge of the shock (see ﬁg. 2 in Llama et al. 2011). Our
assumption, that the occulting area is that of the entire half
circle, is an overestimation; however, this is preferable as
the resulting transit depths can be viewed as upper limits
with geometric constraints producing smaller values of δF .
In order to be compared to observations δF would need to
be convolved with the ﬁlter bandpass or spectral resolution.
The results of determining the transit depth due to the
bow shock are in Figure 5 for UV wavelengths. For the ex-
pected value nH (cid:39) 104 cm−3 of the coronal density, and
indeed even for nH larger than the expected value by a fac-
tor of 103, the transit depths are orders of magnitude too
small to be observable. At the unphysically large density
nH = 108 cm−3 expected at the base of the corona (10−3 R(cid:63))
above the photosphere, a hydrogen Lyman-alpha absorption
feature and a C VI emission feature are apparent. Both are
still a factor ∼ 103 too small to be measurable by HST.
Note that the emission feature from highly ionized C VI is
in emission as the slab is brighter than the background star
at such unphysically large columns for C VI in the slab.

In order to further interpret our results, we can estimate
the optical depth of spectral lines. The optical depth of a
spectral line would be

tical to each other for the entire UV.

The cooling time is thus much longer than the dynamical
time, and the post-shock gas leading the planet should not
be expected to cool signiﬁcantly. Therefore, post-shock tem-
peratures comparable to the coronal temperatures are rea-
sonable within the context of the model being examined.

The net transmitted spectrum of the shocked material is in

late the transit depth, δF , due to the magnetosheath being

the cloud is calculated to be between ∼ 2.664 × 10−11 and
2.663 × 10−8 for all UV and optical wavelengths for densi-
ties between 104 − 107cm−3, respectively. For a density of
108cm−3 the optical depths are calculated to be 2.663×10−7
across the UV and optical except for the Lyman-alpha and
C VI line. All of these optical depths are too small to cause
any detectable absorption (Figures 4 and 5).

Additionally, we perform a thorough parameter search
with CLOUDY to determine what conditions can cause ab-
sorption in the UV and to check the robustness and biases
of the nominal parameters (Table 1). The following cloud
parameters are explored:

(i) Temperature from 2,000 to 2 × 106 K
(ii) [F e/H] from 0 (solar) to +1
(iii) ∆rm from 0.24 RJup to 3 RJup
(iv) nH values from 104 cm−3 to 1012 cm−3
(v) Stellar luminosity from 1 to 5 L(cid:12)

The results are presented in Figure 6. The top panel shows
the result of scaling the coronal density up to levels a fac-
tor ∼ 108 above that expected at the orbital radius of the
planet, and a factor of 104 higher than that expected at
the base of the corona. Even at such high densities, transit
depths over the range 300 − 450nm are still at the < 0.1%
level. The middle panel of Figure 6 shows the result of using
an unphysically low value for the shock temperature (104 K)
of the coronal gas. In this case, absorption lines for H I, Si
II, and C II exhibit transit depths between ∼ 0.2 − 1.5%
at very high densities 107 − 108 cm−3. Lastly, the bottom
panel of Figure 6 again shows transit depths for a shock tem-
perature 104 K, now in the NUV (NUVA, NUVB, NUVC)
bands. Again at unphysically high densities there is now ab-
sorption by He II, Mn II, Mg I, and Mg II. The results of
the bottom panel are at odds with the detection of Mg I but
no Mg II absorption in HD 209458b, a typical hot Jupiter
(Vidal-Madjar et al. 2013). The mean ionization fraction av-
eraged over the width of the cloud (T=104 K) for Mg I =
10−13.092 and Mg II = 10−9.181. Therefore, this result sug-
gests that the temperature of the planetary gas producing
the Mg I absorption in HD 209458b is at a lower tempera-
ture, consistent with the temperature upper limits found by
Vidal-Madjar et al. (2013).

3.2 Discussion

We ﬁnd that using realistic parameters (Table 1) for the
shocked coronal plasma in the CLOUDY modeling clearly in-
dicates there is no species present that can absorb in the UV
with any detectable optical depth (Figures 4 and 5). This
is also true for all other wavelengths examined (including
optical). The mean ionization fractions of H, He, C, Ne, Na,
Mg, Al, Cl, Ca Sc, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Nu, and Cu found
using CLOUDY indicate that there aren’t any spectral lines
observed in the UV (e.g. Na I, Al I, Sc II, Mn II, Fe I, Co
I, Mg I, Mg II) because the atoms are highly ionized (Ta-
ble 2). The results from our CLOUDY models appear to be at
odds with the previous investigations of an early UV ingress

the nominal model (Table 1) at varying hydrogen densities
(nH ) for ground-based (Top) and Hubble Space Telescope
(Middle/Bottom) UV wavelengths. We do not detect any UV
absorbing species under realistic conditions for the shocked coro-
nal plasma that could cause an early UV ingress (Vidotto, Jardine
& Helling 2011a).

Note. — The values in this table were taken for the nominal
model presented in Table 1 with a hydrogen density of
108 cm−3. Every CLOUDY model produced very similar trends.
The ionization fractions presented are averaged over the width
of the cloud.

(Vidotto, Jardine & Helling 2010, 2011a,b; Vidotto et al.
2011; Llama et al. 2011, 2013). The models in these papers
suppose the source of opacity is Mg II; however, at tem-
peratures characteristic of the corona, magnesium is highly
ionized with very little Mg II remaining (see Table 2, also
Ben-Jaﬀel & Ballester 2014). While much of the literature
focuses on Mg II, this applies more broadly: coronal gas,
either pre- or post-shock, will consist primarily of highly-
ionized species with no expectation of opacity from neutral
or singly-ionized species. For example, there should be no
expectation of Lyman or Balmer absorption coming from
neutral hydrogen within the post-shock coronal gas or lines
from lower energy levels such as Mg I and Fe I (Haswell et al.
2012; Bourrier et al. 2013).

Interactions between the post-shock stellar wind gas
and the planetary gas can result in a hot population of neu-
tral hydrogen through charge-exchange reactions which is
potentially observable (e.g., Tremblin & Chiang 2013); how-
ever, this is not an observation of the shocked stellar wind
gas, as the hot population is generated downstream at the
interaction layer (contact discontinuity) between the post-
shocked gas and the planetary gas (e.g. Kislyakova et al.
2014). For a more detailed discussion, see §4.2.

From the parameter search, we determine the robust-
ness of our results and under what conditions UV absorption
can actually occur. We ﬁnd for reasonable shock temper-

atures between 8 × 105 – 2 × 106 K (consistent with the
coronal temperatures measured for F-, G-, K-, and M-stars:
Aschwanden 2005; Vaiana et al. 1981) that the absence of an
UV absorbing species did not change. Additionally, changing
the [F e/H], ∆rm, and the stellar luminosity for the nominal
model (Table 1) did not help with detectability. Therefore,
our result of not ﬁnding any UV absorbing species is robust.

Turner et al.

In order for the C II 133.5 nm line to appear (as in the Ben-
Jaﬀel & Ballester 2013 HD 189733b observations) we need
a plasma temperature between 2,000-100,000 K (Figure 6)
suggesting that this absorption is not coming from the stellar
corona but likely from a gas with a much lower temperature
such as an escaping planetary atmosphere. We ﬁnd that no
lines or continuum absorption sources appear in the NUV
(NUVA, NUVB, NUVC ﬁlters) space-based wavelengths un-
less the cloud temperatures are below 10,000 K (Figure
6). This suggests that whatever caused the early ingress in
WASP-12b (Fossati et al. 2010; Haswell et al. 2012; Nichols
et al. 2015) was not from shocked stellar wind gas but is
more likely planetary gas as has been previously suggested
(Lanza 2009; Lai, Helling & van den Heuvel 2010; Bisikalo
et al. 2013a; Bisikalo et al. 2013b; Cherenkov, Bisikalo &
Kaigorodov 2014; Lanza 2015). An escaping atmosphere of
WASP-12b would also explain the variability in the complete
set of near-UV observations (Fossati et al. 2010; Haswell
et al. 2012; Sing et al. 2013; Nichols et al. 2015). For the
case of a hot (T ∼ 106 K) gas, we ﬁnd that signiﬁcant opac-
ity (mainly metal lines) only appears for the ground-based
near-UV wavelengths under unrealistic conditions of a nH
above 1010 cm−3 for the nominal model (Figure 6). Also, our
modeling shows that for a density of 1012 cm−3 the cloud ac-
tually becomes brighter than the star at wavelengths lower
than 320 nm.

Due to our results, any interpretation of UV absorption
which relies on shocked coronal gas as the source of opacity
(Vidotto, Jardine & Helling 2010; Turner et al. 2013; Pear-
son, Turner & Sagan 2014; Turner et al. in press) may need
to be re-evaluated. This result also applies more broadly to
all wavelengths, including interpreting optical asymmetry
observations with magnetic bow shocks models. We believe
this result is robust due to the fact that we covered the likely
parameter space and found no eﬀect. Our conclusions add to
a body of theoretical work suggesting that UV asymmetry
observations are not suitable approach for exoplanet mag-
netic ﬁeld detection (Ben-Jaﬀel & Ballester 2014; Grießmeier
2015; Alexander et al. 2015). Additionally, our modeling of
lower temperature clouds suggests that the UV and opti-
cal observations are likely caused by gas from the planetary
atmosphere (Lai, Helling & van den Heuvel 2010; Bisikalo
et al. 2013a; Bisikalo et al. 2013b; Cherenkov, Bisikalo &
Kaigorodov 2014). Therefore, any future models attempting
to explain the early UV observation need to include plane-
tary gas in their simulations. The modeling described here
does not provide any additional constraints on whether a
bow shock exists around close-in exoplanets (see Saur et al.
2013 and VJH11a for conﬂicting arguments) but does show
that the bow shock does not produce any observable signa-
ture in the UV and optical.

We, however, acknowledge that improvements to our
modeling could be considered, such as using a more realis-
tic density structure in the magnetosheath and stellar wind
proﬁle, including (magneto-) hydrodynamics (e.g. TPCI; Salz
et al. 2015a), and 3-D simulations (using pyCloudy; Morisset
2013). Given the broad range of parameters tested here, we
do not expect such improvements to change our conclusions.

4 MODELING OF PLANETARY GAS WITH

CLOUDY

Next, we simulate planetary gas in thermal and ioniza-
tion equilibrium with the radiation ﬁeld. The CLOUDY model
transmission spectra presented in this paper for the plane-
tary gas allow for a comprehensive study of 30 atomic ele-
ments and many molecules in ionization and thermal equi-
librium with the stellar and diﬀuse radiation ﬁeld. Since
CLOUDY balances all the radiative and collisional rates self-
consistently, the present study is able to make predictions
for a number of transitions which have not yet been observed
for any exoplanet.
We ran CLOUDY with the same exact geometry setup as
in § 3 (Figures 2), a width of 1 RJup, a covering factor of
0.0041, geometric factor in Equation 5 of 0.401 (40.1%), an
orbital distance of 0.023 au, and a solar metallicity for the
cloud. The external radiation ﬁeld was the same as used in
§ 3 (Figure 3). The hydrogen density (nH ) in the cloud is
set to 107 and 109 cm−3. The former choice is representa-
tive of the planetary gas found a few planetary radii from
the planet (e.g. Koskinen et al. 2014). The latter choice is
where the gas becomes opaque to Lyman continuum photons
(Murray-Clay, Chiang & Murray 2009) and could be caused
by escaping gas in a thick column (e.g. Roche lobe over-
ﬂow; Lai, Helling & van den Heuvel 2010). The gas kinetic
temperature for this model is set by balancing the heating
and cooling in the gas and the temperatures calculated by
CLOUDY for the 107 and 109 cm−3 clouds are approximately
8725 and 12859 K, respectively.

A brief discussion on the the limitations of our model-
ing for the escaping planetary gas is as follows. We assume
solar metallicity for both models; however, this is a source
of uncertainty. Atomic species which reach the atomic layer
will be carried along with the EUV-driven wind; however,
the degree to which these atmospheres remain well mixed up
to 1 µbar pressures where the gas transitions from molecular
to atomic is unknown (Koskinen et al. 2014). Since the mix-
ing of the atmosphere is beyond the scope of this paper and
goal is only to ﬁnd potential sources of opacity, we view the
assumption of solar metallicity to be suﬃcient. The use of
the static slab geometry will introduce uncertainties in the
amount of absorption as it fails to capture the density and
velocity structures. The denser parts of the atmosphere are
likely not well characterized. This exercise does, however,
still oﬀer potential opacity sources to look for during future
transit observations.

4.1 Results and Discussion

The output transit depths of the planetary gas are in Figure
7 for X-ray, UV (space and ground), and optical and in Fig-
ure 8 for radio wavelengths. The mean ionization fractions
of H, He, C, N, Ni, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, P, Ca, Ti, Mn,
Fe, and Co found using CLOUDY are in Table 3. The most in-
teresting results found for the planetary gas (Figure 7) are
discussed below. The X-ray results (top-left) for a density
nH = 109 cm−3 are consistent with the 8% transit depth
observed on HD 189733b at X-ray wavelengths using Chan-
dra (Poppenhaeger, Schmitt & Wolk 2013). The main source
of opacity for the X-rays is bound-free from hydrogen and
helium and the spectral lines are blended metal lines. The

space-based UV wavelengths from 113-290 nm are shown
(top-right, middle-left, middle-right). The most interesting
lines that are potentially observable (this limit is anything
with a transit depth greater than 0.10%) in this wavelength
regime (113-290 nm) are H I, C I, C II, N I, Ni II, Mg I, Mg
II, Al II, Si II, S I, Mn II, Fe II, and Co II. We ﬁnd that
the Lyman-alpha line now has an optical depth of 124 (very
optically thick), as compared to the optically thin (0.0001)
case for the coronal equilibrium. In the ground-based near-
UV (bottom-left) the most promising observable lines are
Ca II, He I, and Ti II (all not yet observed). In the optical
regime (bottom-right), H-alpha, He I, and Ca II are the most
promising lines. The detection of H-alpha in our modeling
is consistent with the observations of H-alpha in the atmo-
spheres of HD 189733b (Jensen et al. 2012) and HD 209458b
(Astudillo-Defru & Rojo 2013). For the ALMA wavelength
range (Figure 7), binning bands 3-5 together results in a
transit depth of 0.27 %. While this transit depth is possibly
observable (see also Selhorst, Barbosa & V´alio 2013), the
problem with these bands are the fact that the hosts stars
are very faint. The main source of opacity for frequencies
lower than 200 GHz is free-free and between 200-400 GHz
overlapping molecular lines are the dominate source.

There are approximately 20 species (H I, C II, O I, Na
I, Mg I, Mg II, Al I, Al III, Si III, K I, Ca I, Sc II, V II,
Mn I, Mn II, Fe I, Fe II, Co I, Sn I, Eu III, Yb II) with
lines currently observed in exoplanet upper atmospheres
(e.g. Charbonneau et al. 2002; Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003b;
Vidal-Madjar et al. 2004; Sing et al. 2008; Fossati et al.
2010; Linsky et al. 2010, Sing et al. 2011; Haswell et al. 2012;
Jensen et al. 2012; Ben-Jaﬀel & Ballester 2013; Astudillo-
Defru & Rojo 2013; Vidal-Madjar et al. 2013; Bourrier et al.
2013). Many of these same species are found in the CLOUDY
modeling but we also ﬁnd species (e.g. He I, C I, Al II, Si
I/II, S II, Ca II, Ti II, Ni II, Mn II) and lines (e.g. Al III,
Fe II, Mn I) that have not been observed. A comprehensive
list of all the lines predicted can be found in Table 4. There-
fore, future observations are encouraged to search for these
lines but more detailed theoretical models are still needed
to shed light into opacity sources in escaping atmospheres
of exoplanets.

4.2 Planetary gas interacting with the stellar

wind

The gas modeled in § 4.1 is assumed to reside in the planet’s
upper atmosphere. While interaction with the stellar radi-
ation ﬁeld was included, collisions between particles in the
planetary gas and the stellar wind were ignored. However,
there are models for the hydrogen Lyman-alpha absorption
during transit for HD 209458b that invoke charge exchange
of atoms from the planet with solar wind protons to create
fast moving neutral atoms (Holmstr¨om et al. 2008; Tremblin
& Chiang 2013; Christie, Arras & Li 2016). In the limit of
short mean free paths for the atoms in the stellar wind gas,
the energetic atoms occupy a hydrodynamic mixing layer
created by eddies at the interface of the two gases (Trem-
blin & Chiang 2013). For ﬁnite mean free paths (Holmstr¨om
et al. 2008), as long as the mean free path of the atoms is not
much larger than the magenetosheath width, some atoms
can collide with the stellar wind protons and be entrained
with the magnetosheath ﬂow around the planet.

Note. — The values in this table were from the model with a

hydrogen density of 109 cm−3. The ionization fractions
presented are averaged over the width of the cloud. The gas
kinetic temperature calculated by CLOUDY was ∼12859 K (§4).

While we have argued that stellar wind gas near the
bow shock region cannot provide enough opacity to cause
observable transit depths, atoms originating from the planet,
and entrained with the stellar wind ﬂow through the mag-
netosheath could provide this source of opacity, as long as
they are not ionized too quickly by the hot stellar wind
gas. Hence the geometry assumed in the magnetic or non-
magnetic bow shock models may indeed be valid, although
a suﬃcient source of atoms from the planet must always be
considered. As movement of charged particles through the
planetary magnetosphere may only occur along ﬁeld lines,
movement of neutral particles across ﬁeld lines is subject to
strong ion-neutral drag forces (Yelle 2004; Trammell, Arras
& Li 2011). Open ﬁeld lines carrying an outﬂow from the
polar regions of the planet are another possible source of
neutrals (Trammell, Li & Arras 2014).

It is important to distinguish between absorbing atoms
originating in the planet, as is assumed here, and in the
stellar wind, as is assumed in VJH11a. The source matters
even if the geometry is the same. The key point is that the
distribution of planetary neutrals decreases with distance
from the planet and there would be a far greater number
of absorbing species toward the planet. Hence for planetary
neutrals one might expect absorption not only near the bow
shock, but also all along the line from the bow shock to the
planet. This would be a signiﬁcant change to the model used
to interpret the observations as compared to assuming the
absorption is solely from the stellar wind gas.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Using the plasma photoionization and microphysics code
CLOUDY (Ferland et al. 1998; Ferland et al. 2013) we explore
whether there is a UV absorbing species in the stellar wind
that can cause an early UV ingress in the transits of close-
in exoplanets due to the presence of a magnetic (Vidotto,
Jardine & Helling 2011a) or non-magnetic (Lai, Helling &
van den Heuvel 2010; Bisikalo et al. 2013a; Bisikalo et al.
2013b) bow shock compressing the coronal plasma. We ﬁnd
under realistic physical conditions for the corona (Table 1;
§ 3) that there aren’t any species that can cause an ab-
sorption with suﬃcient opacity for all UV wavelengths and
also for all other wavelengths between X-ray and radio (Fig-
ures 4 and 5). A thorough parameter search with CLOUDY is
performed to check the robustness and biases of the nomi-
nal parameters and we ﬁnd that our conclusions are robust
(§ 3.1). Therefore models cannot posit a distribution of neu-
trals only out in the stellar wind, but rather if absorbers are
mixed into the stellar wind, there must be an even larger
population toward the planet which may cause absorption
all the way between the planet and the bow shock. In other
words, the bow shock geometry model which has been used
to infer planetary magnetic ﬁelds is an incomplete model as
it does not confront the likely existence of absorbers between
the bow shock and the planet. Previous detections of an
early ingress in WASP-12b (Fossati et al. 2010; Haswell et al.
2012) and HD 189733b (Ben-Jaﬀel & Ballester 2013; Cauley
et al. 2015) are likely caused by the planetary upper atmo-
sphere or a mixture of planetary and stellar wind material
as suggested by our modeling of clouds with lower temper-
atures (§3.2; Figure 6). Our conclusions are consistent with
other studies suggesting that UV asymmetry observations
are not a suitable approach for detecting exoplanet mag-
netic ﬁelds (Ben-Jaﬀel & Ballester 2014; Grießmeier 2015;
Alexander et al. 2015) and that suggest an escaping atmo-
sphere (Lai, Helling & van den Heuvel 2010; Bisikalo et al.
2013a; Bisikalo et al. 2013b; Cherenkov, Bisikalo & Kaig-
orodov 2014) as the cause of the UV observations.

We also simulate escaping planetary gas in ionization
and thermal equilibrium with the stellar radiation ﬁeld with
CLOUDY (§ 4). From this modeling, we ﬁnd species with strong
absorption lines (Figure 7 and 8; Table 4) previously ob-
served in exoplanet upper atmospheres (e.g. Charbonneau
et al. 2002; Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003b; Vidal-Madjar et al.
2004; Sing et al. 2008; Fossati et al. 2010; Linsky et al. 2010,
Sing et al. 2011; Haswell et al. 2012; Jensen et al. 2012;
Ben-Jaﬀel & Ballester 2013; Astudillo-Defru & Rojo 2013;
Vidal-Madjar et al. 2013; Bourrier et al. 2013) but also make
predictions for many species and lines that have not been ob-
served (Table 4; He I, C I, Al II, Si I/II, S II, Ca II, Ti II, Ni
II, Mn II). Therefore, the CLOUDY modeling in this paper is
a motivation for more detailed studies of possible absorbing
species which may be observable in the transmission spectra
of close-in exoplanets (see also, Salz et al. 2015a,b).

Note. — The model used has a hydrogen density of 109 cm−3 and the gas kinetic temperature calculated by CLOUDY was ∼12859 K
(§4). Additionally, the default resolution model was not used to search for spectral lines due to many spectral lines overlapping each
other. We used the line labels command (creates a list of all emission lines transported in the code) in CLOUDY to determine the species
responsible for each spectral line in Figure 7.
