Abstract

In the probe limit, we investigate holographic paramagnetism - ferromagnetism phase transition in the

four-dimensional (4D) and ﬁve-dimensional(5D) Lifshitz black holes by means of numerical and semi-

analytical methods, which is realized by introducing a massive 2 - form ﬁeld coupled to the Maxwell ﬁeld. We

ﬁnd that the Lifshitz dynamical exponent z contributes evidently to magnetic moment and hysteresis loop of

single magnetic domain quantitatively not qualitatively. Concretely, in the case without external magnetic

ﬁeld, the spontaneous magnetization and ferromagnetic phase transition happen when the temperature gets

low enough, and the critical exponent for the magnetic moment is always 1/2, which is in agreement with

the result from mean ﬁeld theory. And the increasing z enhances the phase transition and increases the

DC resistivity which behaves as the colossal magnetic resistance eﬀect in some materials. Furthermore, in

the presence of the external magnetic ﬁeld, the magnetic susceptibility satisﬁes the Cure-Weiss law with a

general z. But the increase of z will result in shortening the period of the external magnetic ﬁeld.

INTRODUCTION

The AdS/CFT correspondence [1–4] provides a window into the dynamics of strongly coupled

systems by identifying the underlying ﬁeld theory with a weakly coupled gravity dual. Due to

the existence of scaling symmetry near critical point, over the past years the methods and scope

of the gauge/gravity have shifted from traditionally QCD-motivated problems to problems in the

area of condensed matter systems(see reviews [5–8] and references therein) involving the strong

interaction. And the duality also gives us a way to understand gravity and condensed matter

physics from other side.

One of interesting application of the duality is to study high temperature superconductors that

several models of holographic s-wave [9, 10] and p-wave superconductors [11, 12] have been con-

structed among the various paradigms in condensed matter physics. For example, the holographic

s-wave superconductor model was ﬁrst realized via an Einstein-Maxwell theory coupled to a com-

plex scalar ﬁeld in a Schwarzschild-AdS black hole background [9, 13–15]. The condensation of the

scalar breaks the U(1) symmetry of the system, mimicking the conductor/superconductor phase

transition. Sequentially, one analytically studied the superconductor phase transition near the crit-

ical point [16]. Moreover, by an SU(2) gauge ﬁeld in the bulk, a holographic p-wave superconductor

model was constructed [12], in which the condensed vector ﬁeld breaks the U(1) symmetry (one of

subgroup of SU(2)) as well as the spatial rotational symmetry spontaneously.

Recently, some eﬀorts have been made to generalize the correspondence to systems with less

symmetries (see Refs. [16–22], for example) and to the far-from thermal equilibrium problems (see

Refs. [23–27], for example).

The other application of duality is to study ferromagnetism where the electron spins align to

produce a magnetization, which breaks the time reversal symmetry spontaneously and happens

in the ferromagnets at the Curie temperature Tc (sometimes it is even higher than the indoor

temperature). As we know, magnetism plays a central role in quantum phase transitions and is

ubiquitous in many strongly correlated electronic systems, for example, heavy fermion metals. Yet

in holographic contexts, due to various technical challenges, models of magnetism are scarce and

not extensively explored (see e.g. [28]).

Ref. [29], a new example of the application of the AdS/CFT correspondence was proposed

on the ﬁrst to understand these challenging systems by realizing the holographic description of

the paramagnetism/ferromagnetism phase transition in a dyonic Reissner-Nordstr¨om-AdS black

brane. In that model, the magnetic moment is realized by condensation of a real antisymmetric

2

tensor ﬁeld which couples to the background gauge ﬁeld strength in the bulk. In the case without

external magnetic ﬁeld, the time reversal symmetry is spontaneously broken and the spontaneous

magnetization happens in low temperatures. The critical exponents are in agreement with the ones

from mean ﬁeld theory. In the case of nonzero magnetic ﬁeld, the model realizes the hysteresis loop

of single magnetic domain and the magnetic susceptibility satisﬁes the Curie-Weiss law. Obviously,

this model in Ref. [29] give a good starting to explore more complicated magnetic phenomena and

quantum phase transitions.

Although a real anti-symmetric tensor ﬁeld was introduced to realize a holographic magnetic

ordered phase in the above model, a more careful analysis shows there is a vector ghost in the

model. Hence in Ref. [30] a modiﬁed Lagrangian density was put forward, it comes from the

dimensional compactiﬁcation of p-form ﬁeld in String/M-theory for the anti-symmetric tensor,

which is ghost free and causality is well-deﬁned, and keeps all the signiﬁcant results in the original

model qualitatively.

On the basis of Ref. [29], the model was further extended to realize a holographic model of

paramagnetism/antiferromagnetism phase transition by introducing two real antisymmetric tensor

ﬁelds coupling to the background gauge ﬁeld strength and interacting with each other [31]. And

then one studied the coexistence and competition of ferromagnetism and p-wave superconductiv-

ity by combining a holographic p-wave superconductor model with a holographic ferromagnetism

model [32]. It was found that the results in Ref. [32] depend on the phase appearing ﬁrstly (super-

conductivity or ferromagnetism) besides the self-interaction of magnetic moment of the complex

vector ﬁeld.

On the other hand, for insulator/metal phase transition a gravity duality model was constructed

by introducing a massive 2-form ﬁeld and a dilaton ﬁeld coupled with U(1) gauge ﬁeld in asymptotic

AdS black brane background. This model shows the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) eﬀect found

in some manganese oxides materials [33]. Further studies based on this model can be discovered,

for example, the eﬀect of back reaction on the holographic paramagnetism/ferromagnetism. One

found that the phase transition is always second order, which is diﬀerent from holographic super-

conductor exhibiting rich phase structures, especially ”the retrograde condensate”. At present the

holographic duality has been applied to two-dimensional magnetic systems [28, 29, 34], where the

behaviors near the critical temperature were discussed. However, the setup in Ref. [35] deals with

three-dimensional magnetic systems and describes their behaviors in low temperatures where the

technology of spintronics is actively developed, besides near the critical temperature. This holo-

graphic model in principle can provide a means to analyze phenomena involving magnetization

3

and spin transport, and thus it can introduce new perspectives in the ﬁeld of spintronics. However,

all these holographic ferromagnetic models were constructed only in the relativistic spacetimes.

Thus, we wonder whether the above results still hold in nonrelativistic spacetimes, for example,

the Lifshitz spacetime, which is our motivation in this paper.

This paper is organized as follows.

In section 2, we build a holographic paramagnetism -

ferromagnetism phase transition model in the Lifshitz black hole with AdS2 geometry, which is

realized by introducing a massive 2 - form ﬁeld coupled to the Maxwell ﬁeld strength in the bulk.

In section 3 by the semi-analytic method we study the magnetic moment and static magnetic

susceptibility. The summary and some discussions are included in section 4.

II. HOLOGRAPHIC MODEL

A. Background

Recently, the phase transitions in many condensed matter systems are found to be governed
by the so-called Lifshitz ﬁxed points which exhibit the anisotropic scaling of spacetime t → bzt,
(cid:126)x → b(cid:126)x (z (cid:54)= 1), where z is the Lifshitz dynamical exponent representing the anisotropy of the
spacetime. The gravity description dual to this scaling in the D=d + 2 dimensional spacetime was

proposed in Ref. [36]

ds2 = L2(−r2zdt2 + r2d(cid:126)x2 +

1 + . . . + dx2

where d(cid:126)x2 = dx2

(1)
d, and r ∈ (0,∞). This geometry reduces to the AdS spacetime when
z = 1, while it is a gravity dual with the Lifshitz scaling as z > 1. The Lifshitz spacetime (1) can
(cid:90)

be realized by a massless scalar ﬁeld coupled to an Abelian gauge ﬁeld in the following action [37]

where Λ is the cosmological constant, ϕ is a massless scalar and Fµν is an abelian gauge ﬁeld

strength. The generalization of (1) to the case with ﬁnite temperature is [38]

Evidently, choosing the dynamical exponent z to be one reduces the Lifshitz black hole to the

where rh denotes the black hole horizon. As we know, some works have been carried out for the

inﬂuence of the dynamical critical exponent on the properties of holographic superconductors(for

details see Ref. [39–45]). For example, one studied the scalar condensation in a (3+1)-dimensional

Lifshitz black hole background with z = 3/2 and z = 2 in Refs. [39] and [40], respectively. The

s-wave and p-wave superconductor models were built in the (3+1)-dimensional Lifshitz black hole

with z = 2 [41]. Recently, Abdalla et al in Ref. [43] investigated the s-wave superconductor phase

transition in a three-dimensional Lifshitz black hole in new massive gravity with z = 3 and found

a series of peaks in the conductivity for certain values of the frequency. Based on the previous

investigation on the Lifshitz black hole solution, the eﬀects of the Lifshitz dynamical exponent z

on the holographic superconductor models were discussed in some detail via numerical and ana-

lytical methods, including s-wave and p-wave models with [47] or without magnetic ﬁeld [46] [47].

Therefore it is interesting to construct holographic ferromagnetic phase transition by using Lifshitz

black hole solutions and to study the inﬂuences of the dynamical exponent z on the properties of

holographic ferromagnetic phase transition and colossal magnetoresistance eﬀect.

B. Model and EoMs

Following Ref. [30], below we consider the Lagrangian density consisting of a U(1) ﬁeld Aµ and

a massive 2-form ﬁeld Mµν in (d + 2)-dimensional spacetime

Lm = −F µνFµν − λ2(

(dM )2 +

V (M )),

(7)

where dM is the exterior diﬀerential of 2-form ﬁeld Mµν, m2 is the squared mass of 2-form ﬁeld

Mµν being greater than zero (see Ref. [30] for detail), λ and J are two real model parameters

with J < 0 for producing the spontaneous magnetization, λ2 characterizes the back reaction of the

2-form ﬁeld Mµν to the background geometry and to the Maxwell ﬁeld strength, and V (M ) is a

nonlinear potential of the 2-form ﬁeld describing the self-interaction of the polarization tensor. For

simplicity, we take the form of V (M ) as follows,

V (M ) = (∗MµνM µν)2 = [∗(M ∧ M )]2,

(8)

5

where ∗ is the Hodge-star operator. As shown in Ref. [30], this potential shows a global minimum

at some nonzero value of ρ.

By varying action (7), we can get the equations of motion for the matter ﬁelds as

∇τ (dM )τ µν − m2Mµν − J(∗Mτ σM τ σ)(∗Mµν) = Fµν,

∇µ(Fµν +

λ2
4

Mµν) = 0.

(9)

In what follows, we start to study systematically the eﬀects of the Lifshitz dynamical exponent z

on the holographic ferromagnetic phase transition based on the Lifshitz spacetime (3) in the probe

limit(i.e., neglecting the back reactions of the massive 2-form ﬁeld to the background Lifshitz

geometry and Maxwell ﬁeld, also including the Maxwell ﬁeld to the background geometry).

In

this probe approximation, the interaction between the electromagnetic response and external ﬁeld

is taken into account so that we can study how spontaneous magnetization inﬂuences the electric

transport in the following, but they both have little inﬂuence on the structures of materials. We

take the following self - consistent ansatz with matter ﬁelds,

Mµν = −p(r)dt ∧ dr + ρ(r)dx ∧ dy,

Aµ = φ(r)dt + Bxdy,

(10)

where B is a constant magnetic ﬁeld viewed as the external magnetic ﬁeld in the boundary ﬁeld

theory. Thus nontrivial equations of motion in D=d + 2-dimensional Lifshitz spacetime read,

where a prime stands for the derivative with respect to r. In order to solve above equations, we
have to specify boundary conditions for the ﬁelds. At the horizon r → rh, we impose φ(rh) = 0
to satisfy the ﬁnite form Aµ, while ρ(rh) needs to be regular. Near the boundary r → ∞, the
linearized equations give the following asymptotic solution for matter ﬁelds,

gauge/gravity duality and the explanation for the source in Ref. [30], we treat ρ+ as the source of

, ρ±, µ, and σ are all constants. According to

2

the dual operator, namely, ρ+ = 0, and µ and σ are chemical potential and charge density of dual

ﬁeld theory, respectively.

The Breitenlohner-Freedmeltaan (BF) bound requires m2 ≥ −(d+z)(d+z−8)

− 4, and the mass
squared m2 of massive 2-form ﬁeld has the lower bound. In this case, there is a logarithmic term

4

in the asymptotical expansion (12). We treat the coeﬃcient of this logarithmic term as the source

which is set to be zero to avoid the instability induced by this term according to [13]. Within the

BF bound condition, there does not exist the AdS2 geometry, and the near horizon geometry of

an extremal black brane with vanishing temperature. To ﬁnd the restriction to the parameters,

let us consider Eqs. (11) in the high temperature region where ρ vanishes and we can read oﬀ the

eﬀective mass square of ρ at the horizon as,

(13)

Because of J < 0, the temperature term contributes a negative term into the eﬀective mass square,
which is divergent when T → 0. It follows that whether we choose the grand canonical ensemble
or the canonical ensemble, the instability always appears provided that the temperature is low

enough.

C. Spontaneous magnetization and susceptibility

In this paper, we consider the canonical ensemble where the charge density σ will be ﬁxed

when we discuss the Lifshitz black hole background. Concretely, we ﬁrstly consider the cases of

z = 1 and 2 in the 4D spacetime as examples by the numerical and analytic methods, and then

extend to the cases of z = 1, 2 and 3 in the 5D spacetime. Now we think about the spontaneous

magnetization in this probe approximation in the 4D spasetime. To begin with, we compute the

critical temperature Tc when B = 0. Similar to the case in the Ref. [30], the polarization ﬁeld ρ

is a small quantity near the critical temperature, we can neglect the nonlinear terms of ρ in the

equations of φ and p. Then we can get

φ(r) = µ(1 − 1

r2−z ), p(r) =

φ(r) = µ ln r, p(r) =

In the following calculations, we will consider these two cases of z (cid:54)= d and z = d. Then the
equations of ρ are as follows,

To ﬁnd the critical temperature, at the horizon, the initial conditions are,

ρ(cid:48) =

ρ(rh) = 1.

(z = d)

(15)

(16)

When we perform the numerical computation, we can ﬁrst ﬁx the horizon radius rh = 1, thus the

temperature is also ﬁxed. Without loss the generality, we take ρ(rh) = 1 and treat the chemical

potential µ as the shooting parameter to match the boundary condition ρ+ = 0. And then we can

use the scaling transformations to transform our results into the case in canonical ensemble where
the charge density is ﬁxed. As a typical example, we also choose parameters as m2 = −J = 1/8
and λ = 1/2. Thus the critical temperature Tc will be found which are listed in Tab. I. When the

temperature is lower than the critical temperature, we can plot the relationship between ρ+ and

shooting parameter µ, in order to examine whether ρ gets spontaneous condensation. We ﬁnd that

the solution of source free always appears, which results in the spontaneous magnetization of the

system, and breaks the time reversal symmetry in low temperatures. In addition, here it is worth

stressing that in the 5D spacetime, the spatial rotational symmetry is also broken spontaneously,

since a nonvanishing magnetic moment chooses a direction as a special. When the temperature is

lower than the critical one Tc, we have to solve Eq. (11) to get the solution of the order parameter

ρ, and then compute the value of magnetic moment N , which is deﬁned in the 4D spacetime by

(cid:90)

N = −λ2

ρ

2r3−z dr.

(17)

Fig. 1 shows the value of magnetic moment N as a function of temperature with various z in 4D

and 5D Lifshitz black holes backgrounds. Here to see clearly the eﬀect of the dynamical critical

exponent z when we ﬁx the mass squared m2 of the massive 2-form ﬁeld. We see that when the
temperature is lower than Tc, the non-trivial solution ρ (cid:54)= 0 and spontaneous magnetic moment
appears. The numerical results show that this phase transition is a second order one with the

behavior N ∝(cid:112)1 − T /Tc near the critical temperature for all cases calculated above. The result

is still consistent with one in the mean ﬁeld theory describing the paramagnetism/ferromagnetism

phase transition. Note that when taking z = 1 and 2 in the 4D and 5D cases, the magnetic moment

will decrease with the increasing z, especially, the corresponding value of the magnetic moment

z = 2 is smaller than ones to other z in 4D case. However, from the lower right corner of Fig. 1, it

easy to see that the magnetic moment increases faster when T < Tc than ones of other curves in

5D case. This might be due to the fact that for the cases of z = 2 in 4D spacetime and z = 3 in

5D spacetime, there is a logarithmic term in the expansion of the gauge ﬁeld φ near the boundary
r → ∞. In addition, at the suﬃcient low temperature, the backreaction eﬀect of the matter sector
on the background geometry becomes important, thus the probe approximation considered here

would be no longer valid.

For comparison, we list in Tab. I the critical temperature Tc and the condensation behavior near

Tc for the cases of z = 1, 2 and 3 with the ﬁxed squared mass. From the table, we can ﬁnd that

when we increase z, Tc increases for the ﬁxed D, which indicates that the increasing anisotropy

between space and time enhances the phase transition. This can be understood as follows. We can

see from Eqs. (11) that near the horizon, the eﬀective mass of the massive 2-form ﬁeld decreases

as the dynamical critical exponent z increases. This leads to a higher critical temperature as z

increases.

In the following we calculate the static magnetic susceptibility in this probe limit, deﬁned by

5D case. The inverse susceptibility density in paramagnetic is shown in Fig. 2.

D. DC conductivity in the ferromagnetic phase

As we know, the electric transport is also an important property in the materials involving

spontaneous magnetization. Now let us study how the DC conductivity is inﬂuenced by sponta-

This limit can give out

the main features near the critical temperature. However, in the case of near zero temperature, we

have to consider the model with full back reaction, which will be our work in the near future.

To compute the conductivity, we have to consider some perturbations for gauge ﬁeld with

harmonically time varying electric ﬁeld. Due to the planar symmetry at the boundary, the con-

ductivity is isotropic. Thus for simplicity, we just compute the conductivity along the x-direction.
According to the dictionary of AdS/CFT, we consider the perturbation δAx = ax(r)e−iωt. In the
probe limit, this perturbation will also lead to the perturbations of polarization ﬁeld in the ﬁrst

order of . As a result, we have to consider the perturbations for all the components of gauge ﬁeld

and polarization ﬁeld. However, if we only care the conductivity in the low frequency limit, i.e.,
T (cid:29) ω → 0, the problem can be simpliﬁed. In the low frequency limit, we only need turn on the
three perturbations,

δAx = ax(r)e−iωt,
Mrx = Crx(r)e−iωt,
Mty = Cty(r)e−iωt,

with p and ρ determined by Eqs. (11). Here O(ω) is the terms with order of ω which can be
neglected when ω → 0. In general, the term ω2/rz+1f (r) can not be neglected since f (r) is zero
at the horizon, which makes the limit of ω → 0 ambiguous. However, at the horizon, if we impose
the ingoing conditions for Crx, Cty and ax,

Cty = e−iωr∗[C(0)
Crx = e−iωr∗[C(0)
ax = e−iωr∗[a(0)

the DC conductivity is given by

(24)

As a holographic application of the membrane paradigm of black holes, we can directly obtain the

DC conductivity from Eq. (21) using the method proposed by Iqbal and Liu in [48]. In fact, the

transport coeﬃcients in the dual ﬁeld theory can be obtained from the horizon geometry of the

dual gravity in the low frequency limit. Applying this into U (1) gauge ﬁeld, this conclusion implies

that the DC conductivity is given by the coeﬃcient of the gauge ﬁeld kinetic term evaluated at the
horizon. To see this, we assume that T > 0 and ω → 0, then we can neglect all the terms of ω in
Eqs. (21). We ﬁrst note that,

x − λ2Crx/4) = rz+1z

Eqs. (21b) and (21c), we have,

Here p0 and ρ0 are the initial values of p(r) and ρ(r) at the horizon, which can be computed

With the appearance of ferromagnetism, DC resistivity decreases when the sample gets cooling,

which shows in many interesting phenomena in condensed matter physics, especially in a class

of manganese oxides which are widespread because of the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance

(CMR) [50, 51]. Note that this eﬀect has a complete diﬀerent physical origin from the “giant”

magnetoresistance observed in layered and clustered compounds.

In recent twenty years, CMR

is among the main topics of study within the area of strongly correlated electron systems and

its popularity is reaching the level comparable to that of the high-temperature superconducting

cuprates. Here the expression of (31) is just appropriate for the case of 4D spacetime. However, for

the 5D Lifshitz spacetime, we only need to replace the coeﬃcient 1/z in front of the bracket in (31)

with 1/(z + 1). It is no diﬃcult to ﬁnd that the dynamical exponent z has no eﬀect on the shape

14

of curve for the ﬁxed D from Fig. 3, But it aﬀects the value of DC resistivity when the sample gets

cooling, i.e., the bigger the value of z, the bigger the DC resistivity although it decreases with the

lower temperature. Moreover, the DC resistivity decreases faster near the critical temperature Tc in

the case of 5D than the one in the case of 4D. In the right panel of Fig. 3, we show the experimental

data from a typical CMR material La1−xSrxMnO3 as an example. We see that our model gives a
very similar behavior to the latter in a composition range of x ≥ 0.175. Meanwhile Fig. 3 shows
that the eﬀect of dynamical exponent z on DC resistivity is diﬀerent from the composition x, i.e.,

the increase of the composition x will result in the decrease of DC resistivity. Of course, we should

mention here that there still exist some diﬀerences between our model result and experimental

data on CMR. In general, when T > Tc, the material shows a semiconductor or insulator behavior

and the DC resistivity increases with cooling the sample which has been realized by introducing

a massive 2-form ﬁeld and a dilaton ﬁeld coupled with U(1) gauge ﬁeld in asymptotic AdS black

brane background [30]. In our model, however, the DC resistivity is a constant when T > Tc, which

is similar to the Ref. [34]. So this model only gives partial property of CMR when T < Tc. But

this is an exciting and enlightening result, because it implies that this model still can lead to a

possibility to build a holographic CMR model in Lifshitz black hole and to investigate this typical

and important strong correlated electrons system in the AdS/CFT setup.

III. SEMI-ANALYTIC CALCULATIONS NEAR THE CRITICAL TEMPERATURE

In this section, to complement the numerical calculations, we study magnetic moment and static

magnetic susceptibility by using the semi-analytic method, which is diﬀerent from the analytic

method in holographic superconductors but it seems more accurate. Now we focus on the case

It is convenient to make a coordinate transformation by
u = rh/r. As p can be solved directly, then we put it into the equation of ρ(r), and get when z (cid:54)= d

(32)
As we will care about the behavior of T → Tc, the value of ρ will be a small quantity near the
transition point. In this case, we can make a Taylor’s expansion on the nonlinear term of ρ in

However, comparing this result with the previous deﬁnition of the magnetic moment,

We ﬁnd the diﬀerence factor 1/2 between (39) and (40). It should be shown that the expression (39)

is not true. The reason has been explained in [34] according to the Euler homogenous function

theorem and the scaling transformation. Therefore we can get the deﬁnition (40) and still use it

16

in the following. The key step for computing the grand thermodynamic potential is to structure

the Sturm-Liouville problem,1 which is the following ODE:

(41)

with the boundary conditions: one is |ρn(uh)| is required to be ﬁnite at u = uh, f (uh) = 0, and the
other is ρn(0) = 0 at u → 0+. The weight function ω(u) can be an arbitrary positive continuous
function in the region of [0, uh]. From a practical point of view, we choose weight function such

that the values of λn will not inﬂuence the asymptotic solutions of equation (41). There are many

choices for weight function. Here we choose ω(r) = uk with an integer k > 2.
when r → ∞, we note that the asymptotic solution for equation (41) is,

(42)
One can ﬁnd that the second boundary condition corresponds to ρ+ = 0. Let L2([0, uh], ω(u), du)
be the Hilbert space of square integrable functions on [0, uh], i.e.,

ρn = ρ+u∆− + ρ−u∆+.

h(0) = 0, |h(uh)| < ∞} .

Then we can prove that (cid:98)P is the self-adjoint operator on D, i.e.,
∀h1, h2 ∈ D,(cid:104)h1,(cid:98)P h2(cid:105) = (cid:104)(cid:98)P h1, h2(cid:105).

According to the properties of SL problem, the solutions of (41) form a function basis on D with

which one can expand any functions belonging to D, i.e.,
(cid:104)ρn, ρk(cid:105) = δnk,

(47)

1 The method is similar to the one used in Ref. [52], but is completely diﬀerent from the Sturm-Liouville (SL)

eigenvalue method in Ref. [16], there the precision depends on the trial function one chooses.

Let us now turn our attention to the free energy (37). For convenience, we will use scaling

This just conﬁrms the critical behavior obtained in the numerical calculations and the critical

(57) and compare them with the numerical ones.

(62)

To clarify that the results are independent of the speciﬁc form of weight function, we choose k = 3, 4

as two examples. From Tab. I we see that diﬀerent weight functions give diﬀerent values for N1,

a1 and a0, but the same value for the magnetic moment N (up to a numerical error).

The value of a0 can also be obtained directly by solving ODE (41). In the region near the critical
temperature, we assume λ1 = a0(T /Tc − 1). Note that all quantities in (41) are the functions of
temperature, thus taking derivative with respect to T and evaluating at T = Tc, we get,

Here ρ1 is the eigenfunction of (58). Now treat ρT = dρ1

Here Cn are the modules of ρn. Using the fact λ1 = 0 at T = Tc and

This expression is valid in canonical ensemble with ﬁxed charge density σ = 1. It is very useful

to ﬁnd its equivalent form in the case with ﬁxed rh = 1, since it is convenient when we perform

numerical computation. If we ﬁx rh = 1, the shooting parameter is chemical potential µ. The

relation between temperature in canonical ensemble and charge density is given by,

In the case of m2 = −J = 1/8, for example, we have λ2χ−1/µc (cid:39) 2.996(T /Tc − 1), which is
very close to our numerical result λ2χ−1/µc (cid:39) 2.966(T /Tc − 1) given in the numerical calculation
when we take z = 1 in the case of 4D spacetime. But from Tab. I, it easy to see that the magnetic

moment and susceptibility have a great gap when we compare the analytical method with numerical

calculation, especially for the case of 5D Lifshitz spacetime.

Below let us move to the case with B (cid:54)= 0. In this case from (34) we have,

According to (49), we can rewrite it as

Using the expansion expression (49), we have,

For convenience, we assume that {ρn} is an unit base, i.e., Cn=1. Equation (81) is equivalent to

For a given temperature T → Tc, we can combine (82) with (83) to obtain a relation be-
tween external magnetic ﬁeld B and magnetic moment N . Figure 4 shows the results with

22

FIG. 4: The relation between magnetic moment density N and external magnetic ﬁeld B in the cases of

T = 1.05T c, T = 0.9Tc and T = Tc, respectively

T = 1.05Tc, T = 0.9Tc and T = Tc, respectively, in the case of m2 = −J = 1/8. We see that
it is very similar to what we have obtained in [29], particularly for the case of z = 1, d = 2. In
the case of T < Tc, when the external ﬁeld continuously changes between −Bmax and Bmax peri-
odically, the metastable states of magnetic moment can appear. Thus we see a hysteresis loop in

the single magnetic domain. Furthermore from Fig. 4, it is easy to see that the magnetic moment

is not single valued with a general z and D, and the Lifshitz dynamical exponent z has an eﬀect

on the hysteresis loop quantitatively. Particularly, for the cases of z = 2 in 4D and z = 3 in 5D

spacetime, the period of the external ﬁeld B is shorter and the value of the magnetic moment N

will become bigger than ones for the cases of other z in 4D and 5D spacetime.

IV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In summary, we have numerically and analytically investigated the holographic paramag-

netism/ferromagnetism phase transition model in the 4D and 5D Lifshitz black holes in the probe

the eﬀects of the dynamical exponent z on the holographic paramagnetism/ferromagnetism phase

transition. Our results are concluded as follows.

We have obtained the critical temperature Tc ﬁrstly if the model parameters are in some suitable

region and then typically plotted the magnetic moment and the inverse susceptibility density as

a function of the temperature. The results show that, in the case without external magnetic

ﬁeld, the improving of dynamical exponent z results in the increase of Tc, which implies that the

increasing anisotropy between space and time enhances the phase transition. Especially, for the

case of 5D Lifshitz spacetime, the value of magnetic moment changes obviously compared with the

4D spacetime. In the vicinity of the critical point, however, the behavior of the magnetic moment
is always as ∼ (1 − T /Tc)1/2, regardless of the values of z and D, which is in agreement with the
result from mean ﬁeld theory. And the DC resistivity is not relevant to the dynamical exponent z

qualitatively, though in this probe limit it is suppressed by spontaneous magnetization and shows

a metallic behavior. But the value of DC resistivity is inﬂuenced when the sample gets cooling, i.e.,

the bigger the value of z, the bigger the DC resistivity although it decreases with the temperature.

Moreover, in the presence of the external magnetic ﬁeld, the inverse magnetic susceptibility near
the critical point behaves as ∼ (T /Tc − 1) in all cases, which satisﬁes the Cure-Weiss law.

Furthermore, by semi-analytic method we have calculated the magnetic moment and static

magnetic susceptibility, and obtained the relation between external magnetic ﬁeld B and magnetic

moment N near the critical temperature. And we have observed the hysteresis loop in the single

magnetic domain when the external ﬁeld continuously changes between the maximum and minimum

values periodically with a general z or D. But for the ﬁxed value of D, the increase of the dynamical

exponent z could result in shortening the period of the external magnetic ﬁeld. In addition, the

transformation period is smaller in the 5D case than one in the 4D case.

Note that in this paper we only worked on the probe limit by neglecting the backreaction of

the matter ﬁelds. Although the probe limit can reveal some signiﬁcant properties of holographic

ferromagnetic phase transition, maybe the order of the phase transition could be changed once

the backreaction is taken into consideration, and some new phases could emerge. Therefore, it is

interesting to study the inﬂuence of the backreaction of matter ﬁeld to the Lifshitz background

and to see whether there are some new features beyond the probe limit, which will be our research

work in the near future.
