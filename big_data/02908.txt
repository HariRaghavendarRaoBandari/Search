ABSTRACT
We present a method that can be used to recover the spectrum of turbulence from
observations of optically thin emission lines formed in astrophysical disks. Within this
method we analyze how line intensity ﬂuctuations depend on the angular resolution of
the instrument, used for the observations. The method allows us to restore the slope of
the power spectrum of velocity turbulent pulsations and estimate the upper boundary
of the turbulence scale.

1 INTRODUCTION

Accretion disks – mainly protoplanetary disks and those of
binary stars – are of extreme interest, since they demonstrate
the great variety of observational manifestations and allow
studying a big number of physical processes. The main ques-
tion about the mechanism of the angular momentum trans-
fer in the disks has not been completely solved yet, though
the disks have been attracting the interest of many scien-
tists for several decades. From observations one can derive
the rate of accretion onto the central object, which enables
determining the rate of angular momentum loss in the disk.
If we suppose that the angular momentum transfer is driven
solely by the material viscosity in the disk, then we ﬁnd
that the viscosity coeﬃcient in the disks should be anoma-
lously high, by 9 − 11 orders of magnitude higher than the
coeﬃcient of molecular viscosity.

There have been a number of physical processes pro-
posed that could drive the angular momentum trans-
fer: tidal interaction (Papaloizou & Pringle 1977; Lin et al.
1990; Dgani et al. 1994);
(Michel
1984; Sawada et al. 1986; Spruit 1987; Syer & Narayan
1993);
convection (Bisnovatyi-Kogan & Blinnikov 1976;
Paczynski 1976; Shakura et al. 1978; Lin & Papaloizou
1980); accretion disk wind and jets (Blandford & Payne
1982; Lubow et al. 1994; Cao & Spruit 2002; Lynden-Bell
2003); angular momentum transfer by propagating waves
(Lin & Papaloizou 1979; Lubow 1981; Vishniac & Diamond
1989); and various instabilities that can result in the most
probable mechanism, well-developed turbulence. The com-

parison of probable mechanisms show that the high accre-
tion rate in the disks may be explained only by the tur-
bulent viscosity (Shakura 1972; Shakura & Sunyaev 1973;
Lynden-Bell & Pringle 1974) (see also a review by Shakura
(2014)).

To answer the question, whether the angular momen-
tum transfer is driven by developed turbulence in the disk,
and, if so, to understand the nature of the turbulent vis-
cosity, one should be able, if possible, to derive the param-
eters of turbulence from observational data. For the pro-
toplanetary disks,
it has been able to determine mostly
the rough parameters of the turbulence rather than the re-
ﬁned energy spectrum obtained for interstellar medium. In
part, it is done by considering the variations of accretion
rate and/or estimating speciﬁc lifetimes and sizes of pro-
toplanetary disks. In terms of α-parameter, proposed by
Shakura & Sunyaev (1973), the estimated value of the tur-
bulent viscosity varies in a wide range α = 10−3 . . . 10−1,
see e.g. Hartmann et al. (1998). Another possibility to study
turbulence in protoplanetary disk is to use observations of
molecular lines. A general method to derive the turbulent ve-
locity, averaged over the disk, by ﬁtting the multi-parametric
model to interferometric spectra maps was presented in
Guilloteau & Dutrey (1998). With the help of this model the
authors of Dartois et al. (2003) and Guilloteau et al. (2012)
estimated the turbulent line width using the observations
of diﬀerent molecular transitions in the DM Tau protoplan-
etary disk. Their results show that the turbulence in this
disk is sub-sonic with speciﬁc velocities of 0.1 . . . 0.5 of Mach
number.

Turbulent motions in gas can have diﬀerent values of ki-
netic energy on diﬀerent spatial scales. Due to the Doppler

2 D. V. Bisikalo et al.

eﬀect, the turbulent velocity pulsations result in the ﬂuctua-
tions of radiation intensity in the frequency space as well as
in the volume of the turbulent medium. In particular, within
the Kolmogorov approach the large-scale vortices carry the
major fraction of the energy of turbulent pulsations, while
the energy of small-scale vortices is less but they are more
numerous. Thus, the diﬀerent parts of the turbulent energy
spectrum causes the diﬀerent responses in the intensity ﬂuc-
tuations. This potentially enables us to restore the power
spectrum of the velocity pulsations in the turbulent medium
using analysis of the spectral and/or spatial distribution of
the radiation intensity.

(2004)

also Lazarian & Pogosyan

A possible method for extracting the power index of
the turbulence was proposed by Lazarian & Pogosyan
(2006)
and
Lazarian & Pogosyan (2000)). The method utilizes ﬂuctu-
ations of the intensity on diﬀerent frequencies in a single
emission line and in the diﬀerent lines of sight. The authors
showed a connection between the structure function of the
spectral intensity distribution and the statistical properties
of the turbulent velocity as well as the density pulsations.
Using the structure function and assuming Gaussian distri-
bution for turbulent velocity it becomes possible to extract
the power spectrum of the turbulence.

In the present paper we present an alternative approach
to the problem of the extraction of turbulent properties from
the spectral observations. As a basic quantity to express the
characteristics of the turbulence, we choose the variance of
the ﬂuctuations of the center of the observed emission line.
We show that this measure strongly depends on angular res-
olution of the telescope. The telescope’s aperture acts as a
ﬁlter for angular modes of the image, smoothing out the
small-scale angular ﬂuctuations. This ﬁltering reduces the
spatial scale of turbulent velocity pulsations which are re-
ﬂected in the emergent intensity ﬂuctuations. Hence, it is
possible to formulate a relation between the angular resolu-
tion of the telescope and the amount of the turbulent energy
at a corresponding spatial scale.

The paper’s structure is as follows. In Section 2 we
brieﬂy describe the model, explaining how turbulent ﬂuctu-
ations occur in an emission line, discuss the inﬂuence of the
telescope’s resolution on the observed properties of the ﬂuc-
tuations, and propose a method allowing us to recover the
parameters of the turbulent medium by analyzing the statis-
tical properties of the intensity ﬂuctuations. In Section 3 we
perform numerical analysis of the proposed method. Section
4 is focused on various features of the method and we discuss
a number of issues, concerned with the interpretation of the
parameters of the turbulent medium, in particular, a possi-
ble diﬀerence between the observed spectrum of turbulence
and ‘classic’ Kolmogorov spectrum. In the Conclusions we
summarize the results of our study. Appendixes contain the
detailed mathematics formalization of the model.

2 RECOVERY OF PARAMETERS OF

TURBULENT MEDIUM FROM INTENSITY
FLUCTUATIONS

In this section we analyze an optically thin emission line
that forms in a turbulent layer of ﬁnite height along vertical
direction. We assume that physical parameters are the same

in horizontal direction except temperature which can vary.
We discuss the application and modiﬁcation of this model
to real accretion disks in Discussion. One can state that the
proﬁle of an optically thin emission line is a sum of proﬁles,
forming in elementary emission events and shifted due to the
Doppler eﬀect. The reason of the Doppler shift is the thermal
and turbulent motions in the medium. The speciﬁc time,
required by a gas-dust disk to reach thermal equilibrium, is
usually smaller than it’s dynamic timescale (Vorobyov et al.
2014). Therefore, we can neglect temporal ﬂuctuations of
thermal line broadening which otherwise could appear due
to dynamical and radiative heating/cooling.

In real gas-dust disks there are radial and vertical tem-
perature and density gradients. These gradients may aﬀect
properties of the turbulence. However, for the sake of sim-
plicity, hereafter we assume the turbulence to be uniform
and isotropic in the medium. As the magnitude of the ve-
locity pulsations may vary over diﬀerent scales and diﬀerent
lines of sight, the turbulent contribution to the line proﬁle
should be treated as a random. Thus, the optically thin emis-
sion line in a macroscopic volume of the turbulent medium
is the sum of thermal proﬁles that are randomly Doppler-
shifted due to the turbulent motions of the gas. Further we
will assume the turbulence is subsonic, which will allow us
to neglect pulsations of the gas density.

It is known that large vortices usually contain the main
fraction of turbulent energy. These vortices produce high
velocity shifts that cause intensity ﬂuctuations in the line
wings. Velocity pulsations in the line core are driven by small
vortices. On the other hand, the number of small vortices is
much bigger than that of the large vortices. Thus, the eﬀect
of the line broadening by small vortices is averaged. This re-
sults in the smooth line core, but the line wings nonetheless
has strong ﬂuctuations. Hence, the structure of the intensity
ﬂuctuations in a line proﬁle gives us information about the
energy distribution over various spatial scales in the turbu-
lent medium.

Any telescope, including a radio-interferometer, acts as
a ﬁlter of spatial harmonics that eﬀectively averages the im-
age over small-scale components in accordance with its beam
pattern. Since the turbulence in astrophysical objects is, as
a rule, three-dimensional the spatial ﬁltering in the image
plane corresponds to the spatial ﬁltering along the line of
sight. This means that, by conducting spectral observations
at diﬀerent spatial resolutions, one obtains ﬂuctuation sam-
ples on diﬀerent velocity scales. The less angular resolution
of the telescope (wide beam pattern), the smaller the num-
ber of small-scale velocity pulsations in the spectral map.
Thus, when having a suﬃciently comprehensive sample of
emission lines observed at diﬀerent angular resolutions, one
can potentially study the statistical properties of velocity
pulsations on various spatial scales.

2.1 Formation of turbulent intensity ﬂuctuations

in an optically thin emission line

We mentioned above that the shape of an optically thin line
proﬁle is governed by both the thermal and turbulent mo-
tions in gas as well as the number density distribution in the
medium. We use the following expression for the intensity.
Let I(v, R) be the intensity at the radial velocity v, for the
line of sight R = (x, y) along vertical direction, where (x, y)

MNRAS 000, 1–14 (2016)

are the coordinates in the image plane.

I(v, R) = εZ dz n(z) φ[v − u(r), σth(r)] ,

where ε is the emissivity of a single particle; n is the number
density of particles, we allow it to vary in a z-direction only;
φ[v − u, σth] is the Gaussian proﬁle centered at v = u and
having the standard deviation equal to the thermal broad-
ening σth; u(r) is the radial velocity at a point with coordi-
nates r = (x, y, z). The integration performed along the line
of sight.

If one assumes the turbulence to be three-dimensional
and isotropic, the radial velocity distribution u(r) should
completely describe the ﬁeld of turbulent pulsations. Recov-
ering of the radial velocity ﬁeld from observed line proﬁles
is, strictly speaking, an ill-posed inverse problem. However,
certain properties of turbulent pulsations are encoded in the
moments of the spectral intensity distribution.

We consider the column density is constant hence the

total intensity does not depend on the direction:

Z dv I(v, R) = εN ≡ const ,

where the column number density N is

N (R) =Z dz n(z) .

The ﬁrst moment of the intensity distribution may not be
equal to zero as it depends on the turbulent velocity pulsa-
tions averaged along the line of sight:

v(R) =

1

εN Z dv v I(v, R) =Z dz

n(z)

N

u(r) .

(4)

The Doppler shift, caused by turbulent pulsations, adds to
the line broadening along with the thermal motions of the
particles. It is easy to show that the second moment of a
line proﬁle is determined by the thermal broadening and
the speciﬁc distribution of radial velocities:

v2(R) =

1

εN Z dv v2I(v, R)
=Z dz

n(z)

[σ2

N

th(r) + u2(r)] .

The centered second moment (calculated with respect to the
line center 4) is:

[v − v(R)]2 =

1

εN Z dv [v − v(R)]2I(v, R)

= v2(R) − [v(R)]2 .

(7)

(8)

Since the ﬁeld of radial velocities is random, the ﬁrst
moment of a line proﬁle is also a random quantity. Thus,
the shift of the emission line center (4) may have two com-
ponents: a systematic Doppler shift (caused by the motion
of the source as a whole) and a random shift, whose absolute
value and sign are determined by the ﬁeld of turbulent ve-
locity pulsations. The same eﬀect inﬂuences the line width
given by (5) and (7).

By analyzing a wide sample of observed line proﬁles
one can ﬁnd a dependence between the statistical properties
of line intensity ﬂuctuations and the statistical properties of
turbulent velocity pulsations. Let h·i denote the operation of
averaging over the ensemble of velocity pulsations. For the
sake of convenience we assume that the mean value of the

pulsations is zero. We also neglect pulsations of the number
density assuming the turbulence is sub-sonic. This results in
the zero value of the averaged radial velocity of line proﬁle:

(3)

(5)

(6)

hu(r)i ≡ 0 .

(9)

Let us ﬁnd the variance of the turbulent velocity as the en-
semble average given that the three-dimensional turbulence
is uniform and isotropic:

σ2
turb = hu2(r)i ≡ const .

(10)

The last assumption implies that the average contribution
of turbulence to the line broadening is solely determined by
the variance of the turbulent velocity and does not depend
on the line-of-sight direction. But the thermal contribution
may vary from point to point, hence the total line broadening
becomes

hv2(R)i =Z dz

n(z)

(11)

The ensemble average of the centered second moment (7) is
a diﬀerence between (11) and the variance of the line center
ﬂuctuations:

h[v − v(R)]2i = hv2(R)i − h[v(R)]2i ,

(12)

where the second term is determined by the spatial correla-
tion function of the radial velocity:

h[v(R)]2i =Z dz

n(z)

N Z dz′ n(z′)

N

hu(r) u(r′)i .

(13)

It is seen that this quantity does not depend on the spa-
tial temperature distribution but the density distribution
and the spatial statistics of the turbulence. It appears that
this value, when measured by the ﬁltered intensity distribu-
tion, is sensitive to the ﬁlter’s scale. From the observational
point of view such the ﬁltration is equivalent to the action of
aperture of the telescope. Below we will show how properties
of the ﬁltered line center ﬂuctuations are connected to the
properties of the turbulent medium.

2.2 The recovery of properties of turbulent

medium from intensity ﬂuctuations

Modern instruments, just put in operation, (e.g. ALMA)
enable us to conduct high-resolution radio-interferometric
observations of optically thin molecular transitions. By re-
ducing the resolution, we can ﬁlter out certain spatial scales
and, using the proposed technique, derive slices of the tur-
bulent characteristics on various spatial scales.

We can model the variations of the beam pattern by
ﬁltering the intensity ﬁeld in the image plane (see Appendix
B). Let us use the term IL(v, R) to denote an intensity dis-
tribution, observed by a telescope with a beam pattern that
corresponds to the ﬁlter BL(R) with the speciﬁc width L:

IL(v, R) =Z d2R′ BL(R′ − R) I(v, R′) ,
where the ﬁlter satisﬁes the normalizationR d2R BL(R) = 1.

By assuming the statistical uniformity, we can show that the
ensemble average of the line proﬁle depends neither on the
ﬁlter nor on the line-of-sight direction (strictly speaking this

(14)

4 D. V. Bisikalo et al.

statement is correct in the case of sub-sonic turbulence only,
when one can neglect density ﬂuctuations (see Discussion)),

Thus, we propose the following method to restore the power
spectrum:

hIL(v, R)i = hI(v, R)i .

(15)

Let us ﬁnd the expression for the center of a line (4), to
which we applied the spatial ﬁltering procedure (14) with a
ﬁlter’s width L:

(i) We calculate the variance UL of the line center’s radial
velocity for observations with various angular resolution L.
(ii) We approximate the dependence of UL on L by the

expression (21) and derive α.

(16)

(17)

We have shown above that the variance of ﬂuctuations
of the line center averaged over a suﬃciently comprehensive
sample, depend on the resolution of the telescope, Eq. (18).
We also may write out the ensemble-averaged line width:

h[v − v(R)]2i =Z d2R BL(R)Z dz

σ2
th(r)

n(z)
N
+ σ2

turb − UL .

(22)

One can see that the variance of the position of the line
center (18) decreases with the growing ﬁlter width L (lower
resolution), while the squared line width (22) increases. Both
these values can be used to estimate the power spectrum
according to (21), but to use expression (22) we ﬁrst should
estimate the full line width (11) measured regardless of the
ﬂuctuations of its center. On the other hand the estimate of
the full line width may be useful if one can, by some means,
ﬁnds the value of thermal broadening σth distribution. In
this case we can estimate the full turbulent line width σturb
and, by using (20) with L → 0, the largest scale of turbulence
hturb.

The idea to extract properties of the turbulence from
the intensity ﬂuctuations is not new. Lazarian & Pogosyan
(2006) proposed a technique for recovery the power spectrum
of the velocity or density ﬂuctuations using the spectrum of
the intensity ﬂuctuations measured along the velocity axis
in the position-position-velocity data cubes. The intensity
ﬂuctuations spectrum itself is determined via the variance of
diﬀerence of the intensity at diﬀerent frequencies or, equiva-
lently, velocities. This idea may be schematically represented
as

(23)

P (kv) ∝Z dv cos(kvv)Z dv+(cid:10)[I(v1) − I(v2)]2(cid:11) ,

where v+ = (v1 + v2)/2 and v = v1 − v2. The intensities
related to the same line of sight, in case of high resolution
limit, or averaged over a beam of a ﬁnite width. For opti-
cally thin emission line the intensity expressed similar to (1)
but the number density allowed to ﬂuctuate arbitrarily. To
perform the integration over v+ the Gaussian distribution of
the turbulent velocity pulsations was assumed. The authors
showed that the power spectrum P (kv) may be expressed via
the structure or correlation functions for the density and ve-
locity ﬂuctuations. Assuming e.g. the density structure func-
tion it is possible to extract the turbulent velocity power
spectrum from the observations via P (kv). Great advantage
of this method is that it allows for the density ﬂuctuations
and the ﬁnite absorption coeﬃcient.

The method described in the present paper utilizes a
completely diﬀerent idea. We ﬁnd that the variance of the
ﬁrst moment of the optically thin line proﬁle depends on
the angular resolution of the telescope. The variance can be
expressed via the spatial correlation function of the velocity
pulsations which is connected to the turbulent power spec-
trum. Thus, the ﬁltering eﬀect of the telescope’s aperture

MNRAS 000, 1–14 (2016)

vL(R) =

1

QN Z dv v IL(v, R)
=Z d2R′ BL(R′ − R) v(R) .

Note that this quantity, as well as (4), does not depend on
the temperature distribution in the medium, since it disap-
peared when integrating over the velocity in (16).

Denote the variance of the line’s center as UL. It is easy
to show that it does not depend on the line-of-sight direction,
since turbulence is spatially uniform:

UL =(cid:10)v2

L(cid:11) =Z d2R BL(R)Z d2R′ BL(R′)
N Z dz′ n(z′)

×Z dz

n(z)

N

hu(r) u(r′)i .

(18)

However, it is essential that UL depends on the ﬁlter width
L. It is determined by the spatial correlation function of
velocity pulsations hu(r) u(r′)i that may be expressed via
the power spectrum of turbulent pulsations P (k):

(19)

hu(r) u(r′)i =Z d3k e−ik(r−r′)P (k) .

We can assume that within the inertial interval the depen-
dence of the power spectrum on the wave number is a power
law: P (k) ∝ k−α−2, where α > 1. For instance, for the Kol-
mogorov turbulence α = 5/3. The ﬁnite angular resolution
ﬁlters out wave numbers in (19) that are greater than L−1
(or spatial scales smaller than L). The speciﬁc energy of
turbulent pulsations on the scale of wave numbers k is ap-
proximately k3P (k) ∝ k1−α, which means that pulsations on
larger spatial scales carry a larger amount of energy. Thus,
the main contribution to the line intensity ﬂuctuations ob-
viously comes from turbulent pulsations on the spatial scale
corresponding to the angular resolution of the telescope.

An approximate expression for UL can be as follows (see

Appendix B):

UL ≈

α − 1

hturb

2α

h

σ2

turb(cid:20)1 −(cid:18) L

hturb(cid:19)α(cid:21) ,

(20)

where hturb is the largest turbulent scale, and h is the char-
acteristic thickness of the turbulent layer (it depends on the
number density distribution). This function monotonically
decreases with the increasing ratio L/hturb. In particular,
given the Kolmogorov slope α = 5/3 and hturb = h/2, we
have the maximum value of UL at L = 0 (inﬁnitely high
resolution) that can be estimated as 0.1σ2
turb. At extremely
large L, the approach we use to derive (20) is incorrect, but
one can expect UL to monotonically decrease with growing
L and become close to zero at L & hturb.

We suppose that it is possible to estimate the power
α by measuring UL as a function of telescope’s resolution.
This value can be derived from the logarithmic slope of the
following function:

makes possible to extract parts of the power spectrum of tur-
bulence. As the advantage of this method can be noted that
the ﬁrst moment of the line proﬁle determined by the turbu-
lence, not the thermal distribution in the medium, hence it is
free from uncertainties caused by the temperature gradients.

3 NUMERICAL TESTS

To test the proposed method we have calculated two models.
In the ﬁrst model we represent the turbulence by a Gaussian
random ﬁeld of velocity ﬂuctuations. In the second model we
represent the turbulence by a set of vortices with rigid-body
rotation. In both cases the medium is assumed isothermal.
In the tests we calculated the power spectrum of turbulent
velocity pulsations directly (from the velocity distribution)
and using the proposed method.

3.1 Gaussian ﬁeld of velocity ﬂuctuations

Let us deﬁne the turbulent ﬁeld of radial velocities as a sum
of independent realizations of Fourier harmonics on a 2-D
discrete grid with the dimension of Nx × Nz. We look at
the system along the Z-axis. We derive the distribution of
radial velocity over the grid by applying the inverse Fourier
transform

(28)

where P is the power spectrum of turbulent velocity pulsa-
tions; multipliers 4 (left-hand side) and 2π (right-hand side)
are needed to take account of turbulence isotropy. We as-
sume that the harmonics’ phases are subject to a random
uniform distribution in the interval from 0 to 2π. The re-
sulting radial velocity ﬁeld is shown in ﬁg. 1.

For each line of sight l we calculate an intensity distri-

bution in the velocity space according to (1):

(the limits depend on the ﬁlter). For each proﬁle IL(v, l) we
calculate the position of the line center:

vL(l) =Z dv v IL(v, l) .

(31)

Using the sample of proﬁles we should calculated the

to be close to zero)

We have chosen the following parameters of our model.
The grid dimensions are Nx = 5000, Nz = 250. The thermal
and turbulent line widths are σth = 25 and σturb = 0.3σth =
7.5 respectively. The power spectrum in our 2D model is:

P (k) ∝( 0 ,

k > 2π/Nz .

We assumed the following normalization

(35)

The proﬁle examples free of the contribution of ther-
mal line broadening are shown in ﬁg. 2. One can see that
the position of the center of lines varies depending on the
resolution L. As we expect, when the ﬁlter width growth
the intensity distribution tends to a proﬁle averaged over all
lines of sight, which corresponds to L = Nx.

The power spectrum we use (34) implies the maximum
turbulent scale equal to hturb = h = Nz. Taking into account
the other parameters we can derive a theoretical dependence
of the line center variance on the ﬁlter width:

We have modeled the dependence of UL for two ﬁl-
ters, a Gaussian ﬁlter and a box ﬁlter with the width L,
and for various values of exponent of the power spectrum:
α = 1.3, 1.67, 2.0. The obtained results are shown in ﬁg. 3.
As one can see that the exponent, estimated from modeled
curves, is in a good agreement with the theoretical estimates
in the case of α = 1.3, and is slightly underestimated for
α = 1.67 and α = 2.0. The reason of this eﬀect is in the
fact that we used only the inertial interval of the power
spectrum (i.e. short-wavelength), when calculating the the-
oretical dependence (20), while the long-wavelength part of
the power spectrum was only approximated. As the power
index α growth, the contribution of the large scale velocity
pulsations to UL growth also. Since this contribution consid-
ered approximately the measured curve max(UL) − UL be-
comes shallower, hence converges more slowly to the power
ﬁt (21). We can state that the slope of the modeled function
UL asymptotically approaches the theoretical value in the
limit of small ﬁlter scales (or high resolution).

with a Kolmogorov power spectrum (α = 1.67).

3.2 Rigid-body vortices

Let us represent the turbulent medium as a random distri-
bution of vortices that ﬁll a 2-D computational domain of
Nx × Nz and do not intersect. Let all the vortices rotate as a
rigid-body with the same angular velocity. We assume that
the entire volume is ﬁlled with isothermal gas, and the radial
velocity is equal to zero out of any vortex. The spectrum of
vortex sizes is assumed to be power-law.

Let us ﬁrst solve the direct problem of the calculation
of power spectrum. We should obtain an auto-correlation
function of the velocity ﬁeld:

Vlm =

Nx−1

Nz −1

Xl′=0

Xm′=0

ul′m′ u(l′+l)(m′+m)

(37)

(we assume that radial velocity is equal to zero outside the
computational domain). The Fourier amplitudes of this func-
tion – when depending on a single wave number – are con-
nected with the power spectrum P (k) of interest via:

| ˜Vqp| ∝Z k

Xkqp <k

where

˜Vqp =

mp(cid:19) Vlm ,

(38)

(39)

and the wave number kqp depends on the wave indexes in
accordance with (26).

To solve the inverse problem one should transform the
radial velocity ﬁeld into the distributions of intensity, ﬁltered
intensity and variance of line center ﬂuctuations according
to (29)–(33).

We used the following parameters in our calculations:
Nx = 5000, Nz = 250, σth = 25. We have calculated two
models that diﬀer from each other by the variance of turbu-
lent velocity and the slope of power spectrum. In the ﬁrst
model σturb = 3.9. The vortices have spatial sizes from 1
to 100. The slope of the spectrum of vortex sizes has been
chosen to provide a Kolmogorov power spectrum of velocity
pulsations with α = 1.67. The radial velocity distribution

in the computation domain is shown if ﬁg. 4. In the second
model σturb = 9.8, α = 1.9. The resulting line proﬁles free of
thermal broadening are shown in ﬁg. 5. One can see a promi-
nent peak at v = 0 in the proﬁles. It occurs because of the
spatial distribution of vortices, namely because we required
no intersection of vortices to appear. The distribution of ve-
locity in rigid-body vortices explains the presence of peaks
far from the line center. As one can see, all the features in
the line proﬁles are smoothed with the growing ﬁlter width,
and the resulting proﬁles tends to its average shape.

In ﬁgures 6 and 7 we show the calculated energy spec-
tra for both the models. The model with the steep power
spectrum has resulted in an underestimated value of α as in
the case of the Gaussian ﬁeld of velocity pulsations.

In general, we can argue that the proposed model and
method allow us to estimate the slope of the spectrum of tur-
bulence using statistical properties of line proﬁle moments.

4 DISCUSSION

Above, we presented a method to estimate the slope of the
energy spectrum of turbulence in a uniform layer using op-
tically thin emission line proﬁles observed at diﬀerent angu-
lar resolutions. In fact, the model of a plane-parallel layer
is rather simplistic representation for any astrophysical ob-
jects of our interest. For instance, protoplanetary disks are
expected to have strong gradients of density and tempera-
ture, both in vertical and radial directions, see e.g. Armitage
(2015). For the inclined protoplanetary disks, there is also
a strong line-of-sight regular velocity gradient due to the
Keplerian rotation. We expect that parameters of line pro-
ﬁles will strongly depend on angular resolution due to these
systematic eﬀects. So the technique of extracting the turbu-
lent spectrum presented above cannot be implemented in its
original form since the inﬂuence of the systematic physical
gradients can be much higher than statistical eﬀects of tur-
bulent ﬂuctuations. However, there is a way to modify the
method taking into account the complex structure of the
object.

Suppose, that we have a ‘good’ theoretical model of the

object that can well prescribe its regular physical structure,
i.e. the distribution of density, temperature, regular veloc-
ity, concentration of emitting molecules, etc. The parame-
ters of such model can be found via ﬁtting the observed
spectra by model spectra. It is important, that the model
spectra are calculated taking all the physical eﬀects into ac-
count except turbulent ﬂuctuations. Given this model, we
can calculate the map of residual spectra i.e. the diﬀerence
between observed and theoretical spectra. The basic state-
ment of the modiﬁed method is that the diﬀerences between
the observed and model line proﬁles are supposed to be pro-
duced mainly by turbulent ﬂuctuations which are not in-
cluded in the model. We expect that these diﬀerences will

depend on the angular resolution of the observed map in the
similar way as for the case of uniform layer.

In practice, for the observed map with given angular res-
olution, we should calculate the variance UL of the observed
line center velocities in respect to the line center positions of
the model lines. Note, the line center positions of the model
lines will be diﬀerent over the map since the presence of reg-
ular velocity gradients. This procedure should be done for
a number of observed maps with diﬀerent angular resolu-
tions L. The dependence of UL on L will provide us with
the information of turbulent spectrum. Since we suggest to
calculate variance UL using all the spectra from the whole
map, the implicit assumption of this approach is that the

turbulent energy spectrum is the same over the whole ob-
ject. Of course, this assumption can be over-simpliﬁed but
we hope that it would give us, at least, the information about
the average turbulent spectrum in the object.

The key requirement of the method is to have a set of
observed maps with diﬀerent angular resolutions. These set
can be provided not only by diﬀerent individual observa-
tions. In fact, the set of maps can be naturally produced as
a result of a single interferometric observation. Indeed, dur-
ing the reconstruction of the observed spectra map from the
observed visibilities we can apply diﬀerent masks in uv-space
and select certain visibilities to be used. The diﬀerent sets
of visibilities will correspond to diﬀerent angular resolutions
of the reconstructed spectra maps.

Another important condition to the developed method
is the use of optically thin lines for which the intensity is
linearly proportional to the surface density of the layer. In
principle, one may try to include the eﬀects of self-absorption
and to generalize the method for optically thick lines as well.
However, the radiative transfer eﬀects are diﬃcult to tackle
and this will make the problem signiﬁcantly more complex.
To our excuse, it is likely possible to select optically thin lines
among a number of emission lines available for particular
object. For example, if the source is studied in CO lines,
its molecular isotopologues C18O or 13CO can be adopted if
the emission lines of main isotopologue CO turn out to be
optically thick.

The problem to extract turbulent spectrum becomes
even more complicated if one takes into account the com-
pressibility of the medium, which is absolutely necessary
when considering super-sonic turbulence. In this case the
ﬂuctuations of the column density contribute both to the
ﬂuctuations of the total line intensity and to the intensity
spectral distribution. We plan to address this problem in our
future studies.

Among all the astrophysical objects, the protoplanetary
disks are likely the most attractive sources to be studied with
the described method. There are two general arguments to
support this statement. The ﬁrst argument is that the inter-
ferometric observations of protoplanetary disks have become
very productive over the last years. For instance, ALMA’s
longest baseline is D = 16 km, which results in the angu-
lar resolution of 0.1′′ 1. If one observes a gas-dust disk from
the distance of 140 pc, this angular resolution corresponds
to the spatial resolution ∼ 10 AU. Taking into account the
fact that the speciﬁc sizes of these disks are up to several
hundred AUs, one can see that this spatial resolution is suf-
ﬁcient to study the spatial disk’s structure in detail. The
maximum spectral resolution of ALMA in terms of velocity
is 10 m/s, which is signiﬁcantly less than the speciﬁc val-
ues of the thermal (∼ 200 m/s), turbulent (∼ 100 m/s) and
Keplerian (∼ 1 km/s) velocities. This enables studying de-
tails of the kinematic structure of gas-dust disks including
turbulence. The high eﬃciency of ALMA has already bean
used to study turbulence in protoplanetary disks. For ex-
ample, most recent observations of a particular HD 163296
protoplanetary disk and following analysis by Flaherty et al.
(2015) allowed them to estimate the upper limits of the tur-

bulent motions to be about 3 per cent in respect to thermal
line width.

The second argument is based on the fact that va-
lidity of the method crucially depends on the assumption
that theoretical model successfully reproduce regular (non-
stochastic) features of the object and its observed spectra
maps. Between the objects where turbulence is important,
the protoplanetary disks seem to be most reliably theoreti-
cally described. The present models of protoplanetary disks
include many physical eﬀects and are able to explain the reg-
ular distributions of density, temperature and velocity inside
the disks (Armitage 2015). With the help of such models
it is possible to reconstruct the parameters of the observed
disks from the interferometric observations, see e.g. review of
Dutrey et al. (2014). Moreover, the parameter ﬁtting of the
disk structure based on interferometric observations have
become standard procedure. To our notion, the presented
model of deriving the turbulent spectrum can be included
as a part of this procedure. However, such implementation
of the method as well its application to real disks should be
the subject for separate paper. The goal of the current paper
was to check if the method could work in principle even for
the case of uniform layer.

Now, let us give some notes about energy spectrum
of turbulence regardless the method. In the model of the
Kolmogorov turbulence the properties of turbulent motion
are determined by a single speciﬁc parameter ǫ, which is a
speciﬁc ﬂux of the energy transmitted from large-scale pul-
sations to small-scale pulsations (Landau & Lifshitz 1959).
If we assume this quantity to be constant over the turbu-
lent cascade, then we should not have energy loss within
the inertial interval. The energy of pulsations is transmitted
from large scales to small scales without loss. The dissipa-
tion of energy takes place only on the smallest scale, which
is determined by molecular viscosity. Thus, from dimension
considerations one can obtain all the main relations for the
Kolmogorov turbulence. We should remind the reader that
in the frame of this model (Landau & Lifshitz 1959) the ex-
ponent of the spectrum of turbulence is α = 5/3 within the
inertial interval, and is α = 3 within the dissipative interval.

However, the model of turbulence may be self-similar if

MNRAS 000, 1–14 (2016)

one accepts a more general relation

ǫ = ǫ0λβ .

(40)

In this case the energy ﬂux ǫ is not constant over the en-
tire turbulent cascade. The exponent β characterizes energy
loss within the inertial interval during the transition from
large to small scales. This energy loss may be caused by, for
instance, radiation. β = 0 corresponds to the Kolmogorov
turbulence. If β > 0 the energy ﬂux decreases from large
to small scales, and, oppositely, at β < 0 it increases from
large to small scales. Within this approach from dimension
considerations we can easily derive the following relation:

α =

5
3

+

2
3

β.

(41)

Thus, the case with α = 3 corresponds to β = 2. This
means that the energy dissipation due to radiation should
take place mostly on large scales and should decrease toward
smaller scales.

5 CONCLUSIONS

In this work we propose a method allowing us to restore
the parameters of sub-sonic turbulence in astrophysical disks
from the proﬁles of optically thin emission lines observed at
diﬀerent angular resolutions. The method allows ﬁnding the
slope of the energy spectrum of turbulence and, in some
cases, it allows us to estimate the largest spatial scale of
turbulence and the height of the turbulent layer.

Within this method we analyze the ﬂuctuations of in-
tensity in the line proﬁle. The ﬂuctuations are caused by
turbulent velocity pulsations in the medium. We show that
the ﬁnite angular resolution of a telescope inﬂuences the
statistical properties of the ﬂuctuations in the observed line
proﬁle. The eﬀect of the ﬁnite resolution is in the fact that
the turbulent velocity pulsations on the scales that are be-
low the angular resolution of the telescope are ﬁltered out
and do not contribute to the intensity ﬂuctuations.

The eﬃciency of the method has been demonstrated on
numerical models of the turbulent medium. We have calcu-
lated two fundamentally diﬀerent models. In the ﬁrst model
we represented the turbulent medium by a Gaussian random

velocity ﬁeld. The second model was a set of rigidly rotating
vortices of various sizes. For both the models the method
gives the exponents of the energy spectrum that are in a
good agreement with the theoretical value.

The feature of the proposed method is in the fact that
in order to use it one needs to have only one sample of 3-D
spectroscopic observations, obtained with high angular reso-
lution. Then, by performing spatial ﬁltering in various spec-
tral ranges one can obtain ﬁltered proﬁles, from which it is
possible to recover the parameters of the turbulent medium.
The algorithm and applicability conditions of this method
may be taken into account as recommendations when plan-
ning radio-interferometric observations.

We tested the proposed method of the recovering the

turbulent power spectrum only for the idealized models. Its
application to real protoplanetary disks requires high-quality
observational data which became available with with the
start of ALMA observatory. In the following papers we plan
to adapt and implement this method to real protoplanetary
disks.

a convolution of an elementary proﬁle of particle emission
and the Maxwellian distribution of for the velocity:

jν =Z dv φ(v − u, σ) εn δDhν − ν0(cid:16)1 −
= εnφ(cid:2)ν − ν0(1 − u/c), ∆th(cid:3) ,

v

c(cid:17)i

(A3)

(A4)

where n is the number density of emitting particles; δD[. . . ]
is the Dirac delta function; ∆th = σthν0/c is the thermal
line width; c is the speed of light.

The number density and radial velocity depend on the
spatial coordinates and time, i.e. diﬀerent volumes in the
medium may have diﬀerent values of the bulk velocity and
number density. We assume that the temperature is constant
over the entire volume. The total intensity along a line of
sight, given by the radius-vector R = (x, y) in the image
plane is

I(ν, R) = εZ dz n(r) φ(cid:2)ν − ν0(1 − u(r)/c), ∆th(r)(cid:3) ,

where r = (x, y, z). Hereafter, for the sake of convenience
we express the intensity as a function of the radial velocity,
given that the frequency and radial velocity are connected
via the Doppler shift:

(A5)

ν = ν0(cid:16)1 −

v

c(cid:17) .

(A6)

(A7)

The same expression for a line proﬁle, associated with a line
of sight R, is

I(v, R) = εZ dz n(r) φ[v − u(r), σth(r)] .

In the expression above the line proﬁle is a weighted sum
of Gaussian proﬁles. The center and the thermal width of
each proﬁle may vary in the volume of the medium, and the
number density acting as the weight.

Total intensity integrated over all frequencies is:

I(R) =Z dv I(v, R) = εN (R) ,

The intensity at a given frequency is a random variable for
each line of sight. It depends both on the ﬂuctuations of the
radial velocity of particles and the ﬂuctuations of density.
If the spectrum of turbulence is of Kolmogorov type, the
density ﬂuctuations play insigniﬁcant role in the formation
of an emission line Lazarian & Pogosyan (2006), and one
can neglect them. This is also supported by the fact that,
strictly speaking, the Kolmogorov theory is correct only for
incompressible medium. Below we allow the number density
to change along the line of sight only, i.e. n = n(z).

We denote the averaging procedure over the ensemble of
realizations of a random velocity ﬁeld as h·i. Without loss of
generality we assume that the ensemble average of the radial
velocity is equal to zero everywhere hu(r)i ≡ 0. We also
assume that the ﬁeld of velocity pulsations is statistically
uniform and isotropic. Then we can argue that all the odd
moments of velocity are equal to zero h[u(r)]2n+1i ≡ 0 where
n is a positive integer. The second moment is the variance
of turbulent velocity:

σ2
turb = hu2(r)i .

Let us introduce a ﬁltered line proﬁle as2

IL(v) = εNZ d3r GL(r) φ[v − u(r), σth(r)] ,

(B1)

(B2)

where the column number density N is constant, due to the
assumption n = n(z); L is the spatial ﬁltering scale. In this
expression we simultaneously ﬁlter and integrate along the
line of sight by convolution the integrand with a kernel G(r):

GL(r) = BL(R)

n(z)

N

.

(B3)

The convolution kernel must

satisfy a normalization

R d3r GL(r) = 1.

(A8)

2 Hereafter we omit the explicit dependence on R, implying that
diﬀerent realizations of the line proﬁle I(v) correspond to diﬀerent
lines of sight.

MNRAS 000, 1–14 (2016)

The central velocity of the ﬁltered proﬁle can be found

in the same way as in (A10):

vL =

1

QN Z dv vIL(v) =Z d3r GL(r) u(r) .

(B4)

Its ensemble mean is equal to zero, and the variance is given
by the spatial pair correlation function of radial velocity:

L(cid:11) =Z d3r GL(r)Z d3r′ GL(r′) hu(r) u(r′)i . (B5)

In the Fourier3 space this expression is

UL =(cid:10)v2
UL = (2π)6Z d3k ˜GL(k)Z d3k′ ˜G∗

L(k′) h˜u(k) ˜u∗(k′)i . (B6)

Let us assume that the amplitude of the Fourier harmonics
are not mutually correlated and are isotropically distributed.
In this case the spatial correlation function is determined by
the power spectrum,
h˜u(k) ˜u∗(k′)i = δD(k − k′) P (k) ,

(B7)

and (B6) can be rewritten as

UL = (2π)6Z d3k | ˜GL(k)|2P (k) .

(B8)

Before we start calculating this value let us consider the
power spectrum of the turbulent velocity ﬁeld. Within our
approach we can pick out three speciﬁc spatial scales: the
characteristic disk height h which is determined by the dis-
tribution n(z), e.g. via it’s second momentum; the largest
turbulent scale hturb; and the scale at which turbulence dis-
sipates λ, here h & hturb ≫ λ. Let us assume the following
properties of the turbulence:

• in the inertial interval (h−1

turb ≪ k ≪ λ−1) the spectrum

decreases according to the power law,
P (k) ≡ σ2

turbAk−α−2 ,

where A, α > 0;

(B9)

• on scales larger than the maximal turbulent scale and
smaller than the disk height the spectrum decreases with
increasing k−1;

• on scales larger than the disk height the power spectrum

quickly approaches zero

The speciﬁc energy of turbulent pulsations on a certain scale
k−1 can be estimated as k3P (k) ∝ k1−α. Thus, for α >
1 the most energetic pulsations are those on larger scales.
Hereafter we assume that this is correct in our case.

The power spectrum is normalized by the velocity vari-

ance as follows

turb ≡Z d3k P (k) = 4πZ ∞

dk k2P (k) .

(B10)

Let us separate the integration over the inertial interval as-
suming λ = 0, since this limit does not contribute much to
the normalization:

(2π)−1 R dx eikx f (x), f (x) = R dk e−ikx ˜f (k).

Recovery of the spectrum of turbulence

where C is a positive constant determined by integrating
over the long-wavelength part of the spectrum. According
to our previous considerations we can argue that the second
term in the right-hand side of (B12) is the main contributor
into the turbulent velocity variance, while C is close to zero.
We can write the convolution kernel G(r) in the Fourier

space as

˜GL(k) = ˜BL(k⊥)

˜n(kk)

N

,

(B13)

where k⊥ and kk are the wave numbers in the image plane
and along the line of sight, respectively. For the ﬁltering we
can use either a Gaussian function with the speciﬁc width
L as,

BL(R) =

1

2πL2 exp(cid:18)−

R2

2L2(cid:19) ,

whose Fourier image is

(2π)2 ˜BL(k⊥) = exp(cid:18)−

1
2

k2

⊥L2(cid:19) ,

or a step-function of width L:

BL(R) =

1

πL2 θ(cid:18)1 −

|R|

L (cid:19) ,

whose Fourier image is given by the Bessel function

(2π)2 ˜BL(k⊥) = J0(k⊥L) .

(B14)

(B15)

(B16)

(B17)

In both the cases the ﬁltering in the image plane is, in a
sense, cuts of the power spectrum at the wave number ∼
L−1, i.e.

(2π)4Z d2k⊥ | ˜BL(k⊥)|2 ∼ 2πZ L−1

0

dk⊥ k⊥ .

(B18)

Similarly, the integration over the kk can be thought
as an equivalent to the power spectrum cut-oﬀ at the wave
number ∼ h−1:

(2π)2Z dkk(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

˜n(kk)

N (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2

∼Z h−1

0

dkk .

(B19)

In fact this assumption means that the characteristic width
of the disk must be a well deﬁned quantity, i.e. the disk
matter must be well localized in z-direction.

We are particularly interested in cases when the ﬁlter
scale L is less than the largest turbulent scale hturb. Then,
taking account of (B12), (B18) and (B19), we can rewrite
(B8) as

UL = Cσ2

turb + (2π)6Z k<L−1

As one can see, if we increase the ﬁlter width (i.e. direc-
tivity pattern), the intensity ﬂuctuations in the line pro-
ﬁle decrease. If the ﬁlter scale exceeds the largest turbu-
lent scale the level of ﬂuctuations takes its minimum value
