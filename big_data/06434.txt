ABSTRACT

This article is based on an invited talk given by V. P. Kulkarni at the 8th

Cosmic Dust meeting. Dust has a profound eﬀect on the physics and chemistry of

the interstellar gas in galaxies and on the appearance of galaxies. Understanding

the cosmic evolution of dust with time is therefore crucial for understanding the

evolution of galaxies. Despite the importance of interstellar dust, very little is

known about its nature and composition in distant galaxies. We summarize the

results of our ongoing programs using observations of distant quasars to obtain

better constraints on dust grains in foreground galaxies that happen to lie along

the quasar sightlines. These observations consist of a combination of mid-infrared

data obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope and optical/UV data obtained

with ground-based telescopes and/or the Hubble Space Telescope. The mid-IR

data target the 10 µm and 18 µm silicate absorption features, while the opti-

cal/UV data allow determinations of element depletions, extinction curves, 2175

˚A bumps, etc. Measurements of such properties in absorption-selected galaxies
with redshifts ranging from z ∼ 0 to z > 2 provide constraints on the evolution

of interstellar dust over the past > 10 Gyr. The optical depth of the 10 µm

silicate absorption feature (τ10) in these galaxies is correlated with the amount

of reddening along the sightline. But there are indications [e.g., based on the τ10
/E(B − V ) ratio and possible grain crystallinity] that the dust in these distant

galaxies diﬀers in structure and composition from the dust in the Milky Way and

the Magellanic Clouds. We brieﬂy discuss the implications of these results for

the evolution of galaxies and their star formation history.

Introduction

Only about 1% of the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM) is in the form of dust,

but dust impacts a number of key astrophysical processes, such as ISM heating, cooling,

molecule production and star formation. Moreover, dust grains act as seeds in the growth of

planets. Dust also aﬀects derived galaxy properties such as distances and structures, since

it attenuates and reddens starlight. Dust even aﬀects dark energy studies, since accurate

mapping of the cosmic expansion needs corrections for dust extinction. Unfortunately, not

much is known about the dust in distant galaxies, since it is diﬃcult to observe with direct

imaging. As a result, corrections for dust extinction in distant galaxies often assume that

the dust is similar to that in the Milky Way or the Magellanic Clouds.

So how can we study dust in distant galaxies? One way to investigate dust in the

distant universe is by using the absorption signatures of galaxies against bright background

sources such as quasars or gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Indeed, afterglows of distant GRBs

have been used for observations and modeling of high-redshift dust, including the 2175 ˚A

bump (e.g., Liang & Li 2009; Zafar et al. 2012). Here we focus on quasars, since they

can be observed over longer periods than the GRBs, thus allowing follow-up observations

with a variety of facilities (e.g., to investigate the carbonaceous and silicate dust as well

as the gas properties). The quasar light, on its journey spanning billions of light-years

toward the Earth, passes through multiple galaxies and intergalactic regions at distinct

redshifts along the sightline. These foreground objects produce absorption lines redshifted

by the corresponding amounts in the quasar spectrum. Measurements of these absorption

lines can be used to probe the objects producing them. This absorption-line technique

selects galaxies only by the gas (or dust) cross-section, independent of galaxy brightness or

distance. It thus oﬀers an excellent tool for studying the evolution of gas or dust in galaxies

over large fractions of the age of the universe.

– 4 –

Especially important probes of the interstellar and circumgalactic gas and dust

in galaxies are provided by the strongest of the quasar absorption systems, i.e. the

damped Lyman-α absorbers (DLAs) and the sub-damped Lyman-α absorbers (sub-DLAs).
The DLAs are deﬁned as the absorbers that have H I column density NHI ≥ 2 × 1020
cm−2. The sub-DLAs have somewhat lower, but still very large, H I column densities
1019 ≤ NHI < 2 × 1020 cm−2. The DLAs and sub-DLAs contain most of the neutral gas
available for star formation in the distant universe. The sub-DLAs, despite their lower H I

column densities, appear to be more metal-rich than DLAs (based on the observed gas-phase

abundances of typically undepleted or weakly depleted elements, e.g., Kulkarni et al. 2007a,

2010; Som et al. 2015). Given the large quantities of H I, and the presence of metals, the

DLAs and sub-DLAs are an ideal place to search for interstellar and circumgalactic dust

in the distant universe. We have been using multi-wavelength spectroscopic studies of the

strong quasar absorbers to study interstellar gas and dust in distant galaxies. Our data

are obtained with a combination of UV, visible, and IR facilities such as the Hubble Space

Telescope, the Magellan Clay telescope, the Very Large Telescope, and the Spitzer Space

Telescope, and are complemented by data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey for some

objects.

2. Signatures of Interstellar Dust

To probe the dust in distant galaxies, we focus on three main signatures of dust:

(1) Element depletions: Comparing the gas-phase abundances of refractory elements

relative to that of a volatile element, one can estimate fractions of elements locked up in

the solid phase.

(2) Reddening / extinction of light from background sources: Comparing the spectra

– 5 –

of reddened and unreddened quasars allows the determination of the extinction curve for

the foreground galaxy.

(3) Spectral features expected from dust grains: Observations of speciﬁc absorption

or emission features expected for dust grains gives a direct probe of the dust. The 2175 ˚A

feature is generally associated with carbonaceous dust and the 10 µm and 18 µm features

are associated with silicate dust.

2.1. Element Depletions

The Milky Way ISM shows an overall trend of decreasing gas-phase element abundances

with increasing condensation temperature (e.g., Savage & Sembach 1996; Jenkins 2009).

This anti-correlation is generally interpreted as resulting from the elements with higher

condensation temperature condensing out ﬁrst into the solid phase. [We note, however, that

some exceptions exist–e.g., some elements (such as Si and Fe) with similar condensation

temperatures have diﬀerent depletions, while some elements (such as O and P) have similar

depletion levels, despite showing signiﬁcantly diﬀerent condensation temperatures.] In

general, cool ISM regions show stronger depletion levels than warm ISM regions.

Fig. 1a shows the abundance pattern for a few key elements in the distant galaxies

traced by typical DLAs and sub-DLAs (Prochaska & Wolfe 2002; Meiring et al. 2009), and

comparison Milky Way and SMC ISM abundances (e.g., Welty et al. 1997). It is interesting

that both DLA and sub-DLA absorbers show depletion of the more refractory elements

relative to the volatile element Zn. Moreover, the abundance patterns are roughly similar

between DLAs and sub-DLAs, and are comparable to the pattern in the Galactic halo

ISM. (We note, however, that individual sightlines with large depletions may still exist;

such sightlines may be masked in averages across multiple sightlines. Severe depletions in

– 6 –

individual velocity components in a given sightline can also be masked by averaging over

the various components in that sightline.) Fig. 1b shows the abundance of Fe relative to

Zn (or S, if Zn is not present) in a more recent sample of DLAs (Kulkarni et al. 2015). A

trend of more severe depletion with increasing metallicity is seen (see also Ledoux et al.

2003, Meiring et al. 2006, Vladilo et al. 2011, who reported such a trend as well). A similar

trend is also seen in sub-DLAs (e.g., Meiring et al. 2009). These trends can be understood

in terms of an increasing dust-to-gas ratio with increasing metallicity. As the total number

of metal atoms in an absorbing region increases, more atoms of the refractory elements are

available to condense, which leads to stronger depletion of those elements.

2.2. Reddening and Extinction

Interstellar dust displays a range of reddening properties. The ratio RV = AV /E(B−V )
varies between ∼2 and ∼6 in the Milky Way, with a typical value of 3.1 (see, e.g., Draine

2003). Larger values of RV imply the presence of larger grains. The ratio of reddening to
gas column density E(B − V )/NH diﬀers in diﬀerent galaxies. For example, E(B − V )/NH
is observed to be ≈ 1.73 × 10−22 mag cm2/H for RV = 3.1 in the diﬀuse interstellar
regions in the Milky Way. In the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Small Magellanic
Cloud (SMC), these ratios are about 4.5 ×10−23 mag cm2/H and 2.2 ×10−23 mag cm2/H,

respectively (see, e.g., Draine 2003). More recently, using larger samples, Welty et al.
(2012) ﬁnd E(B − V )/NH ≈ 1.78 × 10−22 mag cm2/H for the Milky Way, 6.46 × 10−23
for the LMC, and 4.37 × 10−23 for the SMC. The average RV values for the SMC bar,
LMC, and LMC2 supershell regions are observed to be ≈ 2.74, 3.41, and 2.76, respectively

(Gordon et al. 2003).

Distant galaxies also redden spectra of background quasars (e.g., Pei, Fall, & Bechtold

1991; York et al. 2006a). Pei, Fall, & Bechtold (1991) reported the ﬁrst evidence for dust

– 7 –

in galaxies traced by DLAs by comparing the spectra of quasars with foreground DLAs,

and those with no foreground DLAs. York et al. (2006a) examined 809 Mg II absorbers
with 1.0 ≤ zabs < 1.9 detected in the quasar spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS). They found a clear evidence of a small but statistically signiﬁcant amount of

reddening, and showed that the amount of reddening correlates with the metal absorption

line strengths. This correlation indicates that the reddening is caused by dust in the

absorption systems along the sightlines, and also shows that there is more dust in the

absorbers with higher metal column densities. Fitting the extinction curve of the quasars

with the template of an unreddened quasar, they found that most of the cases could be

ﬁtted with an SMC-like extinction curve with no 2175 ˚A bump. However, a small fraction

of the distant galaxies do show the 2175 ˚A feature from carbonaceous dust. Khare et

al. (2012) conﬁrmed the existence of dust in the distant quasar absorber galaxies, using

a sample of 1084 absorbers at 2.1 < z < 5.2 with log NHI > 20.0 from the SDSS. They

found evidence for stronger reddening for the absorbers with stronger gas-phase Si lines
(EB−V = 0.0097 for absorbers with WSi II 1526 ≥ 1.0 ˚A vs. EB−V = 0.0039 for absorbers
with WSi II 1526 < 1.0 ˚A). Furthermore, the extinction of the background quasar shows a

strong correlation with the dust-phase column density of Fe in the absorber, and the mean

extinction AV per dust-phase Fe atom for the quasar absorbers appears to be quite similar

to that found in the Milky Way ISM (Vladilo et al. 2006).

2.3. Dust Spectral Features

Carbonaceous Absorption: The 2175 ˚A bump, believed to be produced by carbonaceous

dust, is seen commonly in the Milky Way ISM, although with varying degrees of strength.

The LMC ISM shows a weaker bump along some sightlines, while most SMC sight lines

do not show the bump (but see Lequex et al. 1982, Gordon et al. 2003, Welty et al. 2013

– 8 –

for an example of an unusual SMC sightline that does show the bump and has molecular

absorption and diﬀuse interstellar bands of similar strengths as in the Milky Way). Most

quasar absorbers do not show the 2175 ˚A bump (e.g. York et al. 2006a). The extinction

curves for most quasar absorbers appear to be well-ﬁtted by an SMC-like extinction

curve. On the other hand, a small fraction of absorbers do show the 2175 ˚A bump (e.g.,

Junkkarinen et al. 2004; Srianand et al. 2008; Noterdaeme et al. 2009; Jiang et al. 2010,

2011; Kulkarni et al. 2011; Ledoux et al. 2015; Ma et al. 2015). While most 2175 ˚A bumps

in these studies are relatively weak, similar to the bump toward the LMC, some cases of

stronger bumps more resembling the bump in the Milky Way ISM also exist. Ledoux et al.
(2015) report that ∼ 30% of the absorbers with detections of C I absorption show the 2175
˚A bump. These absorbers are evidently more rich in carbonaceous dust than most other

absorbers.

Silicate Absorption: Silicates consist of SiO4 tetrahedra, combined with Mg++ or Fe++

ions. If the silicates are crystalline, the SiO4 tetrahedra can share O atoms with other

tetrahedra. In amorphous silicates, the number of shared O atoms may be diﬀerent for

diﬀerent tetrahedra. The 10 µm feature originates in resonances due to Si-O stretching

mode in the tetrahedra while the 18 µm feature originates in resonances due to O-Si-O

bending mode. Alignment of the SiO4 tetrahedra in crystalline silicates gives rise to sharp

peaked resonances, causing sub-structure in the broad 10 µm and 18 µm features. On

the other hand, amorphous silicates show broad features without substructure (see, e.g.,

Molster & Kemper 2005). The silicate features at 10 µm and 18 µm are prominent in the

ISM of the Milky Way, and are observed to be broad and featureless, indicating that the

silicate dust is amorphous (see, e.g., Li & Draine 2001).

Silicates comprise ∼ 70% mass of the interstellar dust grains in the Milky Way (e.g.,

Greenberg & Li 1999). Despite this, the silicate dust was not probed in most past studies

– 9 –

of dust in quasar absorber galaxies, which focused primarily on the search for the 2175

˚A bump. In the past few years, our team made the ﬁrst detections of silicate dust in
absorption-selected galaxies at redshifts up to ∼ 1.4. We now discuss the results from these

studies in detail.

3. Silicate Dust in Quasar Absorber Galaxies

We have been carrying out a search for the silicate features in distant galaxies in the

spectra of background quasars. To do this search, we used the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS)

on the Spitzer Space Telescope, since it provided the necessary wavelength coverage with

adequate sensitivity and spectral resolution to search for the redshifted silicate features at

10 µm and 18 µm.

The Spitzer IRS spectra were obtained for quasars that are known to have foreground

absorber galaxies at redshifts 0.2 < z < 1.4. Each of these sightlines is dominated by a

single strong absorber. The redshifts of these absorbers are known accurately from the

measurements of their metal absorption lines in the optical/UV spectra of the background

quasars. These speciﬁc absorbers were selected because they have abundant gas and dust.

The speciﬁc dust signatures we looked for while selecting these targets were: detection of

2175 ˚A absorption, strong reddening or extinction (AV > 0.4) compared to typical quasar

absorbers, or strong element depletions. Some of our targeted absorbers also show detection

of molecules (which is, again, highly unusual compared to most other quasar absorbers,

since only a very small fraction of absorbers are known to have detections of molecules).

The IRS spectra covered the 10 µm feature in every galaxy studied and a part of the 18 µm

feature in 6 galaxies.

– 10 –

3.1. Detections of the 10 µm Feature

The ﬁrst detection of silicate absorption in a quasar absorber was made by Kulkarni

et al. (2007). They observed a zabs = 0.52 absorber along the sightline to the zem = 0.94

blazar AO 0235+164 (Fig. 2). This DLA absorber oﬀers an excellent place to search for

silicate dust because it has one of the highest H I column densities (log NHI = 21.7), shows

21-cm absorption, X-ray absorption, a 2175 ˚A bump, and detection of diﬀuse interstellar

bands (Roberts et al. 1976, Junkkarinen et al. 2004, York et al. 2006b). The background
blazar also shows substantial reddening [E(B − V ) = 0.23 in the absorber rest frame]. The
Spitzer IRS spectrum showed a broad, shallow 10 µm silicate feature at a ∼15 σ level.
Surprisingly, the peak optical depth of the feature (τ10 ≈ 0.08) is about twice that expected
based on an extrapolation of the τ10 vs. E(B − V ) relation for the diﬀuse interstellar clouds
in the Milky Way. The proﬁle of the 10 µm feature is ﬁtted reasonably well by a template

corresponding to the proﬁle for a diﬀuse Galactic ISM cloud or the proﬁle for laboratory

amorphous olivine.

This initial detection was followed up by Spitzer IRS observations of four more quasar

absorbers. The 10 µm silicate absorption feature was detected in all systems at > 4σ level

(Kulkarni et al. 2011). Several more absorbers have been observed since then, and show

the 10 µm absorption (Aller et al. 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016). In general, these absorbers

also show the peak optical depth of the 10 µm feature to be 2-3 times larger than expected
based on an extrapolation of the τ10 vs. E(B − V ) relation for the diﬀuse interstellar clouds
in the Milky Way. Thus the dust in these distant galaxies is likely to be more silicate-rich

than that in the diﬀuse clouds of the Milky Way ISM.

– 11 –

3.2. Crystalline Silicates

The sightline toward the blazar PKS 1830-211 is interesting because of the presence of

an intervening face-on spiral galaxy at redshift zabs = 0.89 with a strong molecular content.

A number of molecules, such as CO, CS, H2O, NH3, HCN, H13CN, CH3CHO, and CH3NH2,

have been detected in absorption in this galaxy (e.g., Wiklind & Combes 1996, 1998;

Menten et al. 2008; Muller et al. 2011 and references therein). This absorber was therefore

targeted for our Spitzer IRS search for silicate dust. Strong absorption is indeed detected

in the 10 µm feature (Aller et al. 2012). However, this feature is not ﬁt well by the smooth

template for amorphous olivine, since it exhibits more structure. We attempted to ﬁt the

observed 10 µm proﬁle with more than 100 templates from laboratory measurements and

Galactic as well as extragalactic astrophysical sources. The best-ﬁt to the observed proﬁle

is provided by a laboratory crystalline olivine (Hortonolite, i.e. Mg1.1Fe0.9SiO4; Fig. 3).
This source appears to show ≥ 95% crystallinity, even higher than the highest crystalline
mass fraction of ∼ 90% ever reported in silicate-producing evolved stars (Jiang et al. 2013).

Such high crystallinity in the interstellar/circumgalactic gas in the absorber galaxies
is very surprising. Highly crystalline silicate dust has been detected in comets (∼7-90%

crystallinity; e.g. Wooden et al. 1999; Bouwman et al. 2003; Molster & Kemper 2005) and
post-AGB stars (∼10-75% crystallinity; e.g., Molster et al. 2001; Molster & Kemper 2005).

However, the Milky Way ISM shows mostly a broad 10 µm feature indicative of amorphous
silicates. The crystallinity of the diﬀuse ISM is estimated to be ≤ 2 − 5% (Li & Draine

2001; Kemper et al. 2004; Li et al. 2007). Bowey & Adamson (2002) examined whether

the broad 10 µm feature could result from a superposition of a large number of crystalline

silicate features. However, this appears to be unlikely, given that the crystalline silicate

resonance features at longer wavelengths are not observed (Molster & Kemper 2005).

Crystalline silicate dust emission has been reported in active galaxies (e.g., Xie et

– 12 –

al. 2014). Some crystallinity has also been reported in ultra-luminous infrared galaxies

(ULIRGs, Spoon et al. 2006), but this is only of the order of 6-13%. Furthermore, the

crystalline features in ULIRGs are more noticeable at wavelengths longward of the 10 µm

feature. Spoon et al. attributed the 6-13% crystallinity (which is still higher than that seen

in the Milky Way ISM) to a short timescale for the injection of crystalline silicates into the

ISM in the merger-driven starbursts in the ULIRGs. But Kemper et al. (2011) suggest that

the crystallinity in these sources may be lower, or that it may be partly associated with

the active galactic nucleus. In any case, while at least some connection between silicate

crystallinity and the starburst activity seems plausible in ULIRGS, there is no sign of strong

star formation activity in the host galaxy of the absorber toward PKS1830-211. Thus,

the absorber toward PKS1830-211 appears to be unusually rich in crystalline silicates.

Examination of the 10 µm features in the other quasar absorbers analyzed so far suggests

that some of them may also have crystalline silicates, although at a lower level, typically
∼ 30% (Aller et al. 2013, 2015).

3.3. The 18 µm Feature

The 18 µm silicate feature arises in O-Si-O bending modes. The ratio of the strengths

of the 10 and 18 µm features varies with changes in dust grain properties such as the

distribution of grain shapes and sizes. In some of the quasar sightlines, the IRS data covered

the 18 µm feature as well as the 10 µm feature. Fig. 4 shows the 10 and 18 µm features in

the absorber at z = 0.68 toward TXS 0218+357 (Aller et al. 2014). The ratio of the peak
optical depths of these features in this sightline is τ10/τ18 = 1.31 ± 0.48. The best-ﬁtting
template for this object is that of amorphous olivine with porous, ellipsoidal particles

(Chiar & Tielens 2006, although we note that given the higher noise level in this spectrum,

we cannot rule out the existence of substructure expected for crystalline silicates). The

– 13 –

τ10/τ18 ratio for this best-ﬁtting template is 1.41, which matches the observed value better

than the ratio expected for an amorphous olivine template with solid, spherical particles

(which predicts τ10/τ18 = 1.62). Future observations covering wavelengths longward of the

18 µm feature are essential to obtain more accurate measurements of the 18 µm feature and

hence of the τ10/τ18 ratio. It is interesting to note, however, that a wide range of values are

observed for this ratio. For example, silicate absorption features in sightlines toward WR
stars with high extinction values show τ10/τ18 ∼ 1.4 − 2.0 (e.g., Chiar & Tielens 2006). On
the other hand, Hao et al. (2005), who detected 10 and 18 µm emission features in quasars,

measured the ratio τ10/τ18 to be in the range 0.30 to 0.93.

3.4. Silicate Strength Correlations with Other Absorber Properties

In the Milky Way ISM, the strength of the silicate absorption is well-correlated with

the reddening of background stars. In the diﬀuse ISM of the Milky Way, this trend is well-ﬁt
by the relation τ10 = 0.17E(B − V ) (Roche & Aitken 1984). Extrapolating this trend
to the low reddening values for the quasar absorbers, one can estimate the expected τ10

values in these sightlines. These estimates are much lower than the observed τ10 values for

these distant galaxies, as mentioned earlier (Kulkarni et al. 2011, Aller et al. 2014, 2015).

This suggests that these distant galaxies are more rich in silicate dust, possibly indicating

more O-rich environments. It is also possible that these sightlines probe inner regions of

the foreground galaxies, given that the silicate feature in the central region of the Milky

Way is also known to be stronger than in the diﬀuse ISM in the outer parts of the Milky

Way. Roche & Aitken (1985) suggested that the latter diﬀerence may be a result of the

Galactic Center region having fewer carbon stars. On the other hand, the 3.4 µm feature

(originating in the C–H stretch from aliphatic hydrocarbon dust) is also stronger in the

Galatic Center region, with the τ3.4/AV ratio being about twice as high toward the Galactic

– 14 –

Center as that in the local ISM (e.g., Pendleton et al. 1994, Sandford et al. 1995). Gao et

al. (2010) suggest that this diﬀerence between the Galactic Center and the local ISM arises

because the dense molecular clouds toward the Galactic Center contain porous composite

dust. Whatever the underlying reason for the diﬀerence between the Galactic Center and

the local ISM sightlines, it is possible that the sightlines covered in the studies of silicate

absorption in quasar absorbers so far probe regions that resemble the Galactic Center more

than the local ISM. Another possibility is that the grains in the quasar absorbers may be

larger in size resulting in lower UV extinction.

The silicate absorption strength appears to be correlated with the gas-phase metal line

strength. For example, τ10 seems to be generally correlated with the rest-frame equivalent

width of the Mg II λ2796 absorption line. This Mg II line is commonly observed in quasar

absorbers and is often highly saturated. Its equivalent width is thus more indicative of

the velocity dispersion of the absorbing gas rather than of the Mg II column density. A

higher velocity dispersion could reﬂect a higher mass for the absorbing galaxy. On the

other hand, recent studies indicate that strong Mg II absorbers may be associated with gas

outﬂows in star-forming galaxies (e.g., Bouch´e et al. 2012, Kacprzak et al. 2012, Bordoloi

et al. 2014). This suggests that the absorbers with stronger silicate 10 µm absorption may

be associated with more massive galaxies or with more vigorously star-forming galaxies

exhibiting stronger outﬂows. While the absorbing galaxy toward PKS1830-211 does not

display strong star formation, it is essential to measure the star formation rates (SFRs)

in the host galaxies of more silicate absorbers to establish whether or not the silicate

absorption strength correlates with the SFR.

There is a very tentative suggestion that the silicate dust absorption strength may be

anti-correlated with the carbonaceous dust absorption strength (Kulkarni et al. 2011). Such

an anti-correlation, if conﬁrmed, may indicate the dichotomy between C-rich environments

– 15 –

and O-rich environments for dust formation. Finally, there is also a tentative anti-correlation

between the silicate peak optical depth and the 21-cm optical depth (Aller et al. 2014).

Larger samples are needed to verify more deﬁnitively whether these trends really exist.

4. Conclusions and Discussion

Silicate dust appears to be common in Spitzer IRS observations of distant galaxies.

The silicate absorption is seen at 10 µm (and 18 µm) in every target where these features

are covered. There appears to be considerable variation in the shape, center, and breadth

of the silicate absorption features (see Fig. 5). Moreover, the data suggest the presence

of crystalline silicate grains in some quasar absorbers. The silicate absorption strength

appears to be correlated with reddening, with a steeper slope than in Milky Way ISM. A

correlation is also seen between the silicate dust absorption strength and the Mg II gas

absorption strength, suggesting that silicate-rich galaxies may be more massive or may have

stronger outﬂows. A correlation between stronger outﬂows and stronger silicate absorption

may seem surprising if outﬂows destroy dust grains. On the other hand, stronger outﬂows

may be associated with higher SFRs and more massive stars resulting in more type II

supernovae, leading to higher silicate dust production.

The presence of crystalline grains in some of these distant galaxies, if conﬁrmed, would

show striking diﬀerences from the dust in the Milky Way ISM, which has amorphous silicate

dust. Amorphous grains result from condensation at temperatures T < 1000 K followed by

rapid cooling. Crystalline grains result from condensation at higher temperatures followed

by slow cooling. After injection into the ISM, crystalline grains can change into amorphous

grains because of exposure to cosmic rays. If distant galaxies have more crystalline dust,

perhaps it arises in warmer regions with lower cosmic ray ﬂux (due to lower star formation

rates and supernova rates).

– 16 –

It thus appears that the dust in distant galaxies may diﬀer in signiﬁcant ways from

the dust in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds. To further establish the properties

of the dust grains in distant galaxies, it is essential to expand the samples and also to

explore the connections between the dust properties and the gas properties. For example,

it would be very useful to determine the depletions of Si, Fe, and Mg in absorbers with

detections of silicate dust. We are currently working on the dust-gas connections using

data archives from Spitzer, Herschel and ground-based telescopes. The archival data will

also be used to measure shapes of extinction curves in individual quasar absorbers and to

constrain relative abundances of silicate and carbonaceous dust grains. The overall aim of

this ongoing archival study [being carried out in collaboration with Dr. E. Dwek (NASA

GSFC)] is to constrain the cosmic evolution of carbonaceous and silicate dust. It would also

be interesting to test potential connections between higher silicate crystallinity and lower

cosmic ray ﬂux with measurements of the host galaxy SFRs and the gas kinematics for the

absorbers with crystalline silicate dust.

Several open questions still remain in the study of interstellar dust in both, the nearby

universe and the distant universe: e.g., where and how grains are formed, how they are

transported from formation sites to interstellar clouds, how they are processed (radiation,

shocks) along the way, how they are built up in denser clouds, and what their structure

is. To make progress on resolving these broad questions, it will help to tackle speciﬁc

issues such as the deviations from the mean depletion vs. condensation temperature trend,

the evolution of carbonaceous vs. silicate dust, the inﬂuence of dust formation vs. dust

processing on grain crystallinity, and the diﬀerences between the dust in quasar DLAs

and GRB DLAs (which are believed to represent environments diﬀering in star formation

rates and in distances from the galaxy centers). Ongoing and future multi-wavelength

observations of quasars and GRB afterglows promise to shed more light on these issues.

Characterizing the diﬀerences between the dust grains in these distant galaxies and those in

– 17 –

the Milky Way and nearby galaxies will be vital to better understand the chemical evolution

of galaxies and to more accurately measure the rate of cosmic expansion at earlier epochs.

Fig. 1.— Left panel: (a) Abundances of a few key elements in DLAs and sub-DLAs, based

on data from Meiring et al. (2009) and references therein. Also shown for comparison are

the abundance patterns observed for the Galactic halo ISM, warm Galactic ISM, and the

SMC ISM. The depletion patterns are similar for DLAs and sub-DLAs, except the pattern

for sub-DLAs is oﬀset to higher abundances. Both the DLA and sub-DLA depletion patterns

appear to be roughly similar to the Galactic halo ISM pattern. Right panel: (b) Depletion

of Fe relative to Zn or S (if Zn is not available) vs. the metallicity based on Zn or S, for the

sample of quasar DLAs analyzed in Kulkarni et al. (2015). A trend of increasing depletion

level with increasing metallicity is seen.

Fig. 3.— The silicate 10 µm absorption feature in a quasar absorber at z = 0.89 toward PKS
