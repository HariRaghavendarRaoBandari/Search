WHERE ARE MOST OF THE GLOBULAR CLUSTERS IN TODAY’S UNIVERSE?

ABSTRACT

The total number of globular clusters (GCs) in a galaxy rises continuously with the galaxy luminosity
L, while the relative number of galaxies decreases with L following the Schechter function. The product
of these two very nonlinear functions gives the relative number of GCs contained by all galaxies at a
given L. It is shown that GCs, in this universal sense, are most commonly found in galaxies within a
narrow range around L⋆. In addition, blue (metal-poor) GCs outnumber the red (metal-richer) ones
globally by 4 to 1 when all galaxies are added, pointing to the conclusion that the earliest stages of
galaxy formation were especially favorable to forming massive, dense star clusters.
Subject headings: galaxies: star clusters — globular clusters: general

1.

INTRODUCTION

Galaxies with luminosities higher than L ∼ 107L⊙ –
in essence, all but the very smallest dwarfs – have mea-
surable numbers of globular clusters (GCs), the mas-
sive compact star clusters that were preferentially formed
during the earliest stages of star formation during galaxy
evolution. The number of GCs present in a given galaxy
increases dramatically with host galaxy mass or lumi-
nosity, but not in a simple linear way (Harris et al. 2013,
hereafter HHA13). At the same time, the relative num-
ber of galaxies decreases continuously with L follow-
ing the empirically based Schechter function (Schechter
1976).

Combining these two opposing trends leads to a rather
simple question: which galaxies contribute the most to
the total number of globular clusters in the universe?
Dwarf galaxies have very few GCs individually, but there
are huge numbers of such galaxies. Contrarily, the
biggest GC populations are to be found in central super-
giant ellipticals like M87, but these are very rare galaxies.
Which ones are the most important when added up over
the entire galaxy population?

At the same time, we can address the question of the
two classic subpopulations of GCs, the blue (metal-poor)
and red (metal-rich) ones that are consistently seen to
form a bimodal distribution in GC luminosity versus
color (e.g. Brodie & Strader 2006). Color index increases
monotonically with GC metallicity and thus is a useful
proxy for [Fe/H], with the dividing line between blue and
red near [Fe/H] ≃ −1. Whereas the blue GCs are consis-
tently found in all galaxies from dwarfs to giants, the red
ones reside preferentially in massive galaxies; quantita-
tive discussions of this trend are given by, e.g., Peng et al.
(2006, 2008) and Harris et al. (2015) (hereafter HHH15).
Because the metal-poor blue GCs are found in all galax-
ies, it could therefore be expected that they would out-
number the metal-richer ones in total, but it is not im-
mediately clear by how much.

In this paper, some simple GC demographics are cal-
culated to gain a ﬁrst answer to these questions. As will
be seen below, the discussion draws heavily on recent

observational gains that establish the numbers of blue,
red, and all GCs within galaxies covering their entire lu-
minosity range (see HHA13, HHA15). In what follows I
have adopted a distance scale of H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1
wherever necessary.

2. ANALYSIS

In Figure 1, the total number of GCs (NGC) is plot-
ted versus host galaxy luminosity (L), from data for 418
galaxies of all types as listed in the recent catalog of
HHA13. Here, no discrimination is made by galaxy type
(spiral, S0, E), but as shown in HHA13 and HHH15, dif-
ferences by type appear to have only second-order eﬀects.
For about half the observed sample (n=216), the original
observations are of suﬃcient photometric precision and
depth to resolve the standard bimodal distribution in GC
colors and thus to obtain the red and blue fractions as
well.

For our purposes here, a useful interpolation curve giv-

ing the trend of NGC versus L(gal), is

logNGC = (cid:26)−3.71 + 0.548x

−0.30 + 0.66x − 0.1815x2 + 0.014x3

(x < 9.35),
(x ≥ 9.35)

(1)
where x = log (LV /L⊙). A marked change in the slope of
this relation happens near L ∼ 2 × 109L⊙; for the dwarfs
fainter than that transition we ﬁnd NGC ∼ L0.5, while
for large galaxies above it we ﬁnd roughly NGC ∼ L1.4.
The ratio of these two quantities is the classic speciﬁc fre-
quency SN = const(NGC/LV ) (Harris & van den Bergh
1981), which has a well known characteristic U-shaped
dependence on L.

In Figure 2, the same relation is shown but now divided
into the blue and red subpopulations. The approximate
interpolation curves shown in the Figure are, for the blue
GCs,

logNGC = (cid:26)−3.39 + 0.51x

15.418 − 3.84x + 0.25x2

(x < 9.35),
(x ≥ 9.35)

(2)

and for the red GCs,

logNGC = (cid:26)−3.75 + 0.48x

(x < 9.35),
−13.31 + 1.50x (x ≥ 9.35) .

The Schechter function giving the relative number of

galaxies per unit luminosity is

The parameters (α, L⋆) may empirically depend some-
what on environment, but in this case the goal is simply
to track the ﬁrst-order behavior of GC populations aver-
aged over all environments. The values adopted here are
α = −1.26 and L⋆ = 2.77 × 1010L⊙ from the SDSS DR6
database discussed by Montero-Dorta & Prada (2009);
many other versions close to this pair of values can be
found in the recent literature, but the precise numbers
do not aﬀect the results of the following discussion in any
signiﬁcant way.

Calculating the total number of GCs in all galaxies
at a given L is then a matter of multiplying Equation
(4) numerically with either (1), (2), or (3) depending on
which GC subpopulation we want to track. The results in
smoothed histogram form are shown in Figure 3, which
gives the total number of GCs in all galaxies within a
constant logarithmic bin size ∆logL = 0.01.
In rough
terms, this graph gives the relative probability that a
globular cluster anywhere in the universe will be sitting
in a host galaxy of luminosity (log L), or equivalently at
a given absolute magnitude.

The shapes of all three curves in Fig. 3 peak strongly
at intermediate luminosities very near L⋆, with a long
gradual ramp down towards the dwarf galaxies at lower
L. Dwarf galaxies are very common but they do not have
enough GCs per galaxy to dominate the totals; and con-
trarily, the highest−L supergiant ellipticals have tens of

thousands of GCs each but they are too rare to domi-
nate. What is perhaps surprising is the height and rel-
ative sharpness of the population peak. Speciﬁcally, we
ﬁnd the following features:

• For all GCs combined, the peak is at log (L/L⊙) ≃
10.53 and 50% of the population lies in the range
log (L/L⊙) = 9.86 − 10.95 (a factor of 12 in L).

• For the blue GCs, the peak is at log (L/L⊙) ≃
10.5 and 50% of the population lies between log
(L/L⊙) = 9.78 − 10.93 (a factor of 14).

• For the red GCs, the peak is at log (L/L⊙) ≃ 10.6
and 50% of them lie between log (L/L⊙) = 10.03 −
10.99 (a factor of 9).

The reason why these peaks are rather high and nar-
row can be seen from Figs. 1 and 2. NGC begins rising
steeply near log (L/L⊙) ∼ 9.5, which is still a decade
below L⋆. Thus the Schechter function is still on the ﬂat
part of its curve (L < L⋆) and the number of galaxies
at a given L is declining only slowly. Once L passes L⋆,
however, the number of host galaxies declines so steeply
that it forces all the curves in Fig. 3 rapidly downward.
In short, the galaxies near L⋆ provide the “best compro-
mise” situation for GC populations in a universal sense:
they have typically several hundred GCs per galaxy, and
are still numerous enough cosmologically to dominate the
GC totals.

The general appearance of Fig. 3 to some extent re-
sembles the Li & White (2009) model calculation of the
total amount of stellar mass contributed by galaxies of
a given luminosity or baryonic mass (see their Fig. 5).
In both cases the distribution is sharply peaked near  L⋆.

Figure 3. Relative number of globular clusters in all galaxies
at a given luminosity (log L). The numbers are for a constant
bin size ∆logL = 0.01 (∆MV = 0.025 magnitude). The values
are normalized so that the total integrated over all L equals 1.
Black curve: the distribution for all GCs combined, regardless of
metallicity; Blue curve: the distribution for only the metal-poor
(blue) GCs; and Red curve: the distribution for only the metal-rich
(red) GCs. The sum of the blue and red curves by deﬁnition equals
the upper curve. The vertical dashed line denotes the Schechter-
function L⋆.

However, the long tail towards low L for the GC numbers
is noticeably more prominent than for all stellar mass, re-
ﬂecting the empirical fact that dwarf galaxies have higher
average speciﬁc frequencies than L⋆-type ones.

For comparison, Figure 4 presents the cumulative dis-
tribution. Half the population of blue GCs resides in
galaxies with L < 1.3 × 1010L⊙, whereas half the red GC
population falls within galaxies with L < 2.8 × 1010L⊙,
a crossing point more than twice as high.

It is also noteworthy from Fig. 4 that the blue, metal-
poor GCs make up almost 80% of all globular clusters
in the universe. A major reason for this predominance
is that in the dwarf-galaxy regime (log (L/L⊙ . 9.5)
there are almost no metal-rich GCs present, and it is
only in the very luminous (and rare) supergiants that
they make up comparable numbers to the metal-poor
ones (see, e.g., Peng et al. 2006; Harris 2009; Harris et al.
2014, for recent examples).

In Figure 5, another version of the probability distribu-
tion is shown, but now plotted versus galaxy halo mass
Mh rather than luminosity; Mh is dominated by dark
matter. The Figure shows the total mass in GCs within
all galaxies at a given Mh rather than the total number,
but these are nearly equivalent given the very shallow
increase of mean GC mass with galaxy mass (HHA13).
This graph was generated through the combination of
(a) a double-Schechter-function form of the number of
galaxies per unit stellar mass M⋆, from (Kelvin et al.
2014), (b) conversion of M⋆ to Mh via the stellar-to-halo
mass ratio SHMR with the convenient parametrization of

points along each curve; i.e. half the clusters are found in galaxies

Guo et al. (2010), and ﬁnally (c) the total mass in GCs
within a galaxy of a given Mh, which has a simple linear
form (HHH15).

The graph indicates that GCs are most likely to be
found within galaxy halos near ∼ 1013M⊙, but the peak
is much broader than in Fig. 3, a result of the very non-
linear conversion of M⋆ (baryonic mass) to Mh. The
slight upturn of the curve for . 1011M⊙ is quite un-
certain (see HHH15 for a discussion of the data), but
is partly determined by the steeper slope of the double
Schechter function for the smallest dwarfs (Kelvin et al.
2014). However, this calculation is more or less arbi-
trarily cut oﬀ below Mh = 1010M⊙, since dwarfs below
this limit have < 1 GC each according to the empirical
evidence (see HHH15).

3. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In this paper some broad-brush demographics of glob-
ular cluster populations are discussed; for the ﬁrst time,
it is possible to estimate quantitatively (though admit-
tedly only to ﬁrst order) which galaxies are responsible
for contributing most of the GCs in the present-day uni-
verse. The combination of the nonlinear shapes of both
the NGC versus L function, and the Schechter function
for galaxy numbers, demonstrates that galaxies in a nar-
row range around the Schechter L⋆ contribute the most.

found within halos in the broad range ∼ 1012−14M⊙,
with the peak near 1013M⊙.

cosmic star formation rate (e.g. Madau & Dickinson
2014). At that later time, the remaining gas was much
more enriched, but it was not as successful at produc-
ing the extremely dense ∼ 105 − 107M⊙ protocluster
clouds within which GCs could form (Harris & Pudritz
1994; Kravtsov & Gnedin 2005; Elmegreen et al. 2012;
Li & Gnedin 2014; Kruijssen 2015).

In the discussion above, the term “globular cluster”
is taken implicitly to mean classically old, massive star
clusters. If we broaden that deﬁnition to include mas-
sive star clusters formed at any time, then it would be
appropriate to include YMCs (young massive star clus-
ters, also sometimes referred to as super star clusters in
the literature) formed in low-redshift mergers between
galaxies, as is seen in nearby active merger remnants
(e.g. Trancho et al. 2014, 2007; Whitmore et al. 2014;
Goudfrooij 2012; Zepf et al. 1999; Carlson et al. 1998,
among others). These young GCs will add to the metal-
rich GC population and to some extent increase their
fraction of the universal population. However, even in
the most prominent mergers (see the citations above for
examples) only some dozens of clusters are added that
are & 105M⊙ and thus likely to survive for many Gyr.
These will not add signiﬁcantly to the old clusters already
present when added up over all galaxies.
In essence,
the GC production in any merger old or young will de-
pend critically on the amount of cold gas available, so
most GC formation happened in the early universe (see
Li & Gnedin 2014, for discussion).

Lastly, the present discussion does not account for GCs
either in the Intergalactic Medium (IGM) or Intraclus-
ter Medium (ICM), i.e. ones not deﬁnitely associated
with any individual galaxy. True IGM clusters far from
any galaxy are extremely hard to ﬁnd and their num-
bers are generally presumed to be be very small, lacking
any evidence to the contrary. ICM populations of GCs
are also not well studied as yet, but are known to ex-
ist in a few rich clusters of galaxies such as Virgo or
Coma (Peng et al. 2011; Durrell et al. 2014; West et al.
2011; Alamo-Mart´ınez et al. 2013). The cases studied so
far indicate that these ICM GCs add up to roughly the
same numbers as are associated with the central Bright-
est Cluster Galaxy in their local environment, and would
therefore not change the totals estimated here signiﬁ-
cantly.

biggest galaxies grow by absorbing their small neighbors.
Thus over time, the peak in Fig. 3 will shift to higher L
and the tail at lower L will shrink. In the past at much
higher redshift, the galaxy population was much more
dominated by dwarfs and the GC population peak was
correspondingly at lower L.

The result that the metal-poor GCs outnumber the
metal-richer ones by a global ratio of roughly 4 to 1
is striking. The implication for galaxy evolution is
that the very earliest stages of hierarchical merging,
when baryonic matter was predominantly in quite low-
metallicity gas, was exceptionally favorable for the for-
mation of dense massive star clusters (see also Kruijssen
2015). The bulk of low-metallicity GC formation appears
to have happened near z ∼ 5 (e.g. VandenBerg et al.
2013; Forbes et al. 2015, and references cited there),
while the metal-richer “red” population predominated
later near z ∼ 2 − 3, much nearer the peak of the
