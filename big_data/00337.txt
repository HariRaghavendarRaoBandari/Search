Abstract. Basic theoretical and experimental aspects of neutrino magnetic moments are
reviewed, including the present best upper bounds from reactor experiments and astrophysics.
An interesting eﬀect of neutrino spin precession and oscillations induced by the background
matter transversal current or polarization is also discussed.

1. Introduction
The period of about last one and a half decade has been celebrated by distinguished discoveries
in particle physics that were honored by two Nobel Prizes. The Nobel Prize in 2013 was awarded
jointly to Francois Englert and Peter Higgs for the theoretical discovery of a mechanism that
contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic particles, and which recently
was conﬁrmed through the discovery of the Higgs boson at LHC. This provides the ﬁnal glorious
triumph of the Standard Model. The Nobel Prize of 2015 awarded to Arthur McDonald and
Takaaki Kajita for the discovery of neutrino oscillations, which shows that neutrinos have
mass. In the Standard Model neutrinos are massless particles. Thus, our present knowledge
on properties of neutrinos opens a window to new physics beyond the Standard Model.

In many extensions of the Standard Model, which account for neutrino masses and mixings,
neutrinos acquire nontrivial electromagnetic properties that hence allow direct electromagnetic
interactions of neutrinos with electromagnetic ﬁelds and other particles. The most well studied
and understood among the neutrino electromagnetic characteristics are the magnetic moments.
A complete recent review on the neutrino electromagnetic properties with a detailed list of
references to the corresponding literature can be found in [1].

In this note, after a short introduction devoted to neutrino electromagnetic vertex and to
neutrino magnetic moments in gauge models, the studies of neutrino magnetic moments in the
reactor neutrino experiments are discussed. After that we ﬂash up the neutrino electromagnetic
interactions in astrophysics and the astrophysical bounds on neutrino magnetic moments. Then
we discuss the most recent new studies and prospects in neutrino magnetic moments that have
appeared after publication of our review paper [1]. The ﬁnal section of the paper is devoted to an
interesting eﬀect of neutrino spin precession and oscillations induced by the background matter
transversal current or polarization. This eﬀect was proposed and pronouncedly discussed in our
papers [2, 3] and has been recently conﬁrmed and used in [4, 5, 6] for an analysis of neutrinos
propagation in anisotropic astrophysical environments.

2. Neutrino electromagnetic vertex
The neutrino electromagnetic properties are determined by the neutrino electromagnetic vertex
function Λµ(q) that is related to the matrix element of the electromagnetic current between the
neutrino initial ψ(p) and ﬁnal ψ(p′) mass states

< ψ(p′)|J EM

µ

|ψ(p) >= ¯u(p′)Λµ(q)u(p).

(1)

The Lorentz and electromagnetic gauge invariance imply [1, 7, 8, 9] that the electromagnetic
vertex function can be written in the form:

Λµ(q) = fQ(q2)γµ − fM (q2)iσµν qν + fE(q2)σµν qνγ5 + fA(q2)(q2γµ − qµq)γ5,

(2)

where fQ, fM , fE and fA are charge, dipole magnetic and electric and anapole neutrino
electromagnetic form factors, and σµν = i
2 (γµγν − γν γµ). The photon four-momentum q is
given by q = p − p′ and form factors depend on the Lorentz invariant dynamical quantity q2.
Note that the Dirac and Majorana neutrinos have quite diﬀerent electromagnetic properties.
This can be easily seen [1] if one accounts for constraints on form factors imposed by the the
hermiticity of the neutrino electromagnetic current and its invariance under discrete symmetries
transformations. In the case of Dirac neutrinos, the assumption of CP invariance combined with
the hermiticity of J EM
implies that fE(q2) = 0. In the case of Majorana neutrinos from the CP T
invariance, regardless of whether CP invariance is violated or not, fQ(q2) = fM (q2) = fE(q2) = 0
and only the anapole form factor fA(q2) can be nonvanishing.

µ

In general case the matrix element of the electromagnetic current (1) can be considered
j = p′2.
between neutrino initial ψ(p) and ﬁnal ψ(p′) states of diﬀerent masses p2 = m2
i
Then the vertex function and form factors are matrixes in the neutrino mass eigenstates space,

6= m2
Λµ(q)ij =(cid:16)fQ(q2)ij + fA(q2)ijγ5(cid:17)(q2γµ − qµ6 q) + fM (q2)ijiσµν qν + fE(q2)ijσµν qνγ5.

For two Dirac neutrinos in the oﬀ-diagonal case (i 6= j) the hermiticity by itself does not imply
restrictions on the form factors and all of them can be nonzero. Two massive Majorana neutrinos
can have either a transition electric form factor or a transition magnetic form factor, but not
both, and the transition electric form factor can exist only together with a transition anapole
form factor, whereas the transition magnetic form factor can exist only together with a transition
charge form factor.

(3)

From the demand that the form factors at zero momentum transfer, q2 = 0, are elements of
the scattering matrix, it follows that in any consistent theoretical model the form factors in the
matrix element (1) should be gauge independent and ﬁnite. Then, the form factors values at
q2 = 0 determine the static electromagnetic properties of the neutrino that can be probed or
measured in the direct interaction with external electromagnetic ﬁelds.

3. Magnetic dipole moment in gauge models
The most well studied and understood among the neutrino electromagnetic characteristics are
the dipole magnetic (diagonal, i = j, and transition, i 6= j) moments

µij = fM (0)ij ,

(4)

given by the corresponding form factors at q2 = 0.

The diagonal magnetic moment of a Dirac neutrino in the minimally-extended Standard

Model with right-handed neutrinos, derived for the ﬁrst time in [10], is respectively,

µD

3eGF mi

8√2π2 ≈ 3.2 × 10−19(cid:16) mi

(5)

where µB is the Borh magneton. Note that the estimation (5) of the obtained value for the
neutrino magnetic moment shows that it is very small.
It is indeed very small if compare,
for instance, with the similar characteristic of electromagnetic properties of charged leptons
(l = e, µ, τ ) that are the anomalous magnetic moments given by

µB ∼ 10−3µB.

(6)

There is also a reasonable gap between the prediction (5) of the minimally-extended Standard
Model with right-handed neutrinos and the present experimental and astrophysical upper bounds
on the neutrino eﬀective magnetic moments. However, in many other theoretical frameworks
beyond the minimally-extended Standard Model the neutrino magnetic moment can reach
values being of interest for the next generation terrestrial experiments and also accessible for
astrophysical observations.

The transition magnetic moment of a Dirac neutrino is given by [11, 12, 13]

The transition magnetic moment µD

The dependence of the diagonal magnetic moment of a massive Dirac neutrino on the
neutrino bi = m2
W mass parameters in the one-loop
approximation in the minimally-extended Standard Model with right-handed neutrinos was
studied in [15, 16, 17]. The calculations of the neutrino magnetic moment which take into
account exactly the dependence on the masses of all particles [16, 17] can be useful in the case
of existence of a heavy neutrino with a mass comparable or even exceeding the values of the
masses of other known particles.

l /m2

As it has been already mentioned, the linear dependence of the neutrino magnetic moment on
the neutrino mass makes its value in general very small. This feature is common for a vide class of
theoretical models and seems to be hardly avoidable. There is also indeed a general problem for
a theoretical model of how to get a large magnetic moment for a neutrino and simultaneously to
avoid an unacceptable large contribution to the neutrino mass. If a contribution to the neutrino
magnetic moment of order µν ∼ eG
Λ is generated by physics beyond the minimally-extended
Standard Model at an energy scale characterized by Λ, then the correspondent contribution to
the neutrino mass is [18, 19, 20]

Therefore, a particular ﬁne tuning is needed to get a large value for the neutrino magnetic
moment while keeping the neutrino mass within experimental bounds. Diﬀerent possibilities to
have a large magnetic moment for a neutrino were considered in the literature starting with
[21, 22], one of the possibilities have been considered recently [23].

4. Neutrino electromagnetic properties in reactor experiments
The most established and sensitive method for the experimental
investigation of neutrino
electromagnetic properties is provided by direct laboratory measurements of antineutrino-
electron scattering at low energies in solar, accelerator and reactor experiments. A detailed
description of diﬀerent experiments can be found in [1, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27]. Here below we focus
on the reactor antineutrino experiment since it provides the best nowadays terrestrial laboratory
upper limit on the eﬀective neutrino magnetic moment, as well a limit on the neutrino millicharge
[38] and probably with the expected improvement of sensitivity will be also sensitive in future
to the neutrino charge radius [28].

In general case the cross section for an antineutrino scattering on a free electron can be
written [29] as a sum of the Standard Model weak interaction and the electromagnetic interaction
contributions,

The best laboratory upper limit on a neutrino magnetic moment [30] has been obtained by
the GEMMA collaboration (Germanium Experiment for measurement of Magnetic Moment
of Antineutrino) that investigates the reactor antineutrino-electron scattering at the Kalinin
Nuclear Power Plant (Russia). Within the presently reached electron recoil energy threshold of
T ∼ 2.8 keV the neutrino magnetic moment is bounded from above by the value

µν < 2.9 × 10−11µB (90% C.L.).

(19)

This limit obtained from unobservant distortions in the recoil electron energy spectra is valid
for both Dirac and Majorana neutrinos and for both diagonal and transitional moments. The
next edition of the antineutrino scattering experiment at the Kalinin Nuclear Power Plant will
provide a reasonable improvement of upper bounds on neutrino magnetic moments (for the
corresponding estimations see in [30, 31]).

Stringent upper bounds on the neutrino magnetic moment have been also obtained in other
recently carried reactor experiments: µν ≤ 9.0 × 10−11µB (MUNU collaboration [32]) and
µν ≤ 7.4 × 10−11µB (TEXONO collaboration [33]). Stringent limits also obtained in the solar
neutrino scattering experiments: µν ≤ 1.1 × 10−10µB (Super-Kamiokande collaboration [34])
and µν ≤ 5.4 × 10−11µB (Borexino collaboration [35]). Quite recent new analysis [36] of the
Borexino data yields more stringent bound µν ≤ 3.1 × 10−11µB.
Interpretations and comparisons among various experiments should take into account the
diﬀerence in the ﬂavour compositions between them at the detectors. It should be mentioned
[37] that what is measured in scattering experiments is an eﬀective magnetic moment µexp
, that
depends on the ﬂavour composition of the neutrino beam at the detector located at a distance
L from the source, and which value is a rather complicated function of the magnetic (transition)
moments µij:

The dipole electric (transition) moments, if these quantities not vanish, can also contribute to
µexp
. For completeness we mention that the absence of distortions of the electron recoil energy
l
spectra in GEMMA experiment was used in [38] to bound from above the neutrino millicharge.
The possibility to constrain qν with germanium detectors at sub-keV sensitivities have been
recently considered also in [39]. The most stringent astrophysical constraint on qν has been
recently obtained in [40].

5. Recent studies and prospects in neutrino magnetic moments
It is planned 1 that a new experiment at the Kalinin Nuclear Power Plant, which is now in the
ﬁnal stage of preparation and is expected to get data within a period of one year, the eﬀective
electron threshold will be reduced to T = 350 eV and the sensitivity to the neutrino magnetic
moment will be at the level µν ∼ 9 × 10−12µB.
A new possibility to distinguish the Dirac and Majorana nature of neutrinos comparing
the values of eﬀective neutrino magnetic moments µνe, µνµ, µντ , if measured in corresponding
experiments, is proposed in [41]. It is shown that in the case of Majorana neutrinos triangle
inequalities, | µντ |2≤| µνe |2 + | µνµ |2 and cyclic permutations, have to fulﬁll, which do not
hold for Dirac neutrinos. Observing a violation of these inequalities would prove either at the
Dirac nature of neutrinos or at the presence of an extra light sterile neutrino mode.

6. Neutrino electromagnetic interactions in astrophysics
If a neutrino has the non-trivial electromagnetic properties discussed above, a direct neutrino
coupling to photons is possible and several processes important for applications in astrophysics
exist [42]. A set of most important neutrino electromagnetic processes is: 1) neutrino radiative
decay ν1 → ν2 + γ, neutrino Cherenkov radiation in an external environment (plasma and/or
electromagnetic ﬁelds), spin light of neutrino, SLν , in the presence of a medium [43, 44, 45, 46];
2) photon (plasmon) decay to a neutrino-antineutrino pair in plasma γ → ν ¯ν; 3) neutrino
scattering oﬀ electrons (or nuclei); 4) neutrino spin (spin-ﬂavor) precession in a magnetic ﬁeld
(see [47]) and resonant neutrino spin-ﬂavour oscillations in matter [48, 49].

The tightest astrophysical bound on a neutrino magnetic moment is provided by observed
properties of globular cluster stars. For a large enough neutrino magnetic moment the plasmon
decay rate can be enhanced so that a reasonable delay of helium ignition would appear. From
lack observation evidence of anomalous stellar cooling due to the plasmon decay the following
limit has been found [50]

(cid:16)Xi,j

| µij |2 (cid:17)1/2

≤ 3 × 10−12µB.

(20)

This is the most stringent astrophysical constraint on neutrino magnetic moments, applicable
to both the Dirac and Majorana neutrinos.

7. An eﬀect of neutrino spin precession due to matter motion
An approach based on the generalized Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation can be used for
derivation of an impact of matter motion and polarization on the neutrino spin (and spin-ﬂavour)
evolution. Consider, as an example, an electron neutrino spin procession in the case when
neutrinos with the Standard Model interaction are propagating through moving and polarized
matter composed of electrons (electron gas) in the presence of an electromagnetic ﬁeld given by
the electromagnetic-ﬁeld tensor Fµν = ( ~E, ~B). As discussed in [2, 3] (see also [51, 52, 53]) the
evolution of the three-dimensional neutrino spin vector ~S is given by

It follows that even without presence of an electromagnetic ﬁeld, ~B⊥ = ~B0k = 0, neutrino spin
oscillations can be induced in the presence of matter when the transverse matter term ~M0⊥ is not
zero. This possibility is realized in the case when the transverse component of the background
matter velocity or its transverse polarization is not zero. It is obvious that for neutrinos with
nonzero transition magnetic moments a similar eﬀect of spin-ﬂavour oscillations exists under the
same background conditions. A possibility of neutrino spin procession and oscillations induced
by the transversal matter current or polarization was ﬁrst discussed in [2, 3]. The existence of
this eﬀect has been recently conﬁrmed in [4, 5, 6] where neutrinos propagation in anisotropic
media is studied.
