Abstract

Time-series data in population health and epidemiology often involve non-Gaussian re-
sponses. In this note, we propose a semiparametric generalized linear models framework for
time-series data that does not require speciﬁcation of a working conditional response distri-
bution for the data. Instead, the underlying response distribution is treated as an inﬁnite-
dimensional parameter which is estimated simultaneously with the usual ﬁnite-dimensional
parameters via a maximum empirical likelihood approach. A general consistency result for
the resulting estimators is given. Simulations suggest that both estimation and inferences us-
ing the proposed method can perform as well as correctly-speciﬁed parametric models even
for moderate sample sizes, but can be more robust than parametric methods under model
misspeciﬁcation. The method is used to analyse the Polio dataset from Zeger (1988) and a
recent Kings Cross assault dataset from Men´endez et al. (2015).

series of counts.

1 Introduction

Datasets in population health and epidemiology often involve non-Gaussian responses, such
as incidence counts and time-to-event measurements, collected over time. Being outside the
familiar Gaussian autoregressive and moving average (ARMA ) framework makes modelling
inherently difﬁcult since it is not always apparent how to specify suitable conditional response
distributions for the data. Consider, for example, the Polio dataset from Zeger (1988), consist-
ing of monthly counts of poliomyelitis cases in the USA from year 1970 to 1983 as reported by
the Centre of Disease Control. Davis, Dunsmuir & Wang (2000) analysed this dataset using an
observation-driven Poisson ARMA model, but ﬁnd evidence of overdispersion in the counts. To
remedy this, Davis & Wu (2009) considered a negative-binomial model for the data. However,
probability integral transformation plots, which should resemble the histogram of a standard
uniform sample if the underlying distribution assumptions are appropriate, show noticeable de-
partures from uniformity for both the Poisson and negative-binomial models (see panels (a) and
(b) of Fig. 1 and Section 5.1). This suggests that neither distribution ﬁts the data adequately. A
ﬂexible yet parsimonious framework for modelling non-Gaussian time-series datasets is there-
fore warranted for such situations where speciﬁcation of the response distribution is difﬁcult.

This paper concerns the class of generalized linear models (GLMs) for time-series data. More

precisely, we consider models of the form

Yt|Ft−1 ∼ ExpFam{µ(Ft−1; β, γ)} ,

(1)
where Ft−1 is the state of the system up to time t, which may include previous observations
Y0, . . . , Yt−1 and previous and current covariates X0, . . . , Xt, µ(Ft−1; β, γ) = E(Yt|Ft−1) is a con-
ditional mean function that may depend on a ﬁnite vector of parameters (β T , γT ) ∈ Rq+r, and
ExpFam{µ} is some exponential family indexed by its mean µ. For clarity of exposition, we
have split the mean-model parameter into two vectors here, with β ∈ R q corresponding to the
systematic component and γ ∈ Rr for the dependence structure of the model. We may also write
µt ≡ µt(β, γ) interchangeably for µ(Ft−1; β, γ) whenever it is more convenient to do so. Some
speciﬁc models of the form (1) have been discussed in Kedem & Fokianos (2002).

The framework (1) is broad and encompasses, for example, Gaussian ARMA models for con-
tinuous data (e.g., Brockwell & Davis, 2009, Chapter 3), Poisson models for count data (e.g.,
Fokianos, Rahbek & Tjøstheim, 1993) and gamma and inverse-Gaussian models for time-to-
event data (e.g., Abraham & Balakrishna, 1999; Gourieroux & Jasiak, 2006). The following are
three explicit models covered by this framework, with the third and perhaps most interesting
example examined in more detail throughout this paper.
Example 1 (Gaussian ARMA models). A process {Yt} is said to follow a Gaussian ARMA(1,1) process
if it is stationary and satisﬁes

Yt = d + φYt−1 + Zt + ψZt−1

2

where {Zt} is a gaussian white noise process. Here, the exponential family in (1) is the normal and the
mean-model parameters are β = d for the systematic component and γT = (φ, ψ) for the autoregressive
and moving average parameters.

Example 2 (Poisson autoregression). Fokianos (2011) recently reviewed the autoregressive Poisson
model Yt|Ft−1 ∼ Poisson{µt} for count time-series data, where µt = d + aµt−1 + bYt−1 for a linear mean-
model, or log(µt) = d + a log(µt−1) + b log(Yt−1 + 1) for a log-linear mean-model. Here, the particular
exponential family in (1) is the Poisson and the mean-model parameters are β = d for the systematic
component and γT = (a, b) for the autoregressive component.

Example 3 (Observation-driven Poisson models). Davis, Dunsmuir & Streett (2003) introduced the
following observation-driven model for count data Yt with covariates xt,

Yt|Ft−1 ∼ Poisson(cid:8)µt = eWt(cid:9) .

It is further assumed that the state equation Wt follows the model

Wt = xT
et = (Yt − eWt)/var(Yt|Ft−1)λ = (Yt − eWt)/eλWt

t β + Zt, Zt = φ1(Zt−1 + et−1) + . . . + φs(Zt−s + et−s) + ψ1et−1 + . . . + ψqet−q,

for some ﬁxed λ ∈ (0, 1] .

Here, the particular exponential family in (1) is the Poisson, the mean-model parameters are β for the sys-
tematic regression component and γT = (φT , ψT ) for the autoregressive and moving average component.
This model is a special case of a generalized linear autoregressive and moving average (GLARMA) model.
Note that the entire GLARMA framework is covered by (1).

While the fully parametric models in Examples 1–3 have proven useful for analyzing par-
ticular datasets, the requirement of a particular exponential family for the conditional response
distribution may be too restrictive for general problems. Indeed, one only has to look at, for
example, the myriad of quasi-Poisson (Kedem & Fokianos, 2002, Chapter 4), zero-inﬂated Pois-
son (Yang, Zamba & Cavanaugh, 2013) and negative-binomial models (Davis & Wu, 2009) to
see that the basic Poisson model is often inadequate for modeling count data. Note also that
these alternative models generally do not form exponential families and are therefore outside
framework (1).

This paper introduces a parsimonious approach for modeling time-series data that is ﬂexible
and robust, yet remains completely within the exponential family framework (1). The proposed
approach is based on a novel exponential tilt representation of generalized linear models (GLMs),
introduced in Rathouz & Gao (2009), that allows the underlying exponential family in (1) to be
unspeciﬁed.
Instead, the particular distribution generating the exponential family is treated
as an inﬁnite-dimensional parameter, which is then estimated simultaneously from data along
with the usual model parameters (β, γ).

The semiparametric framework we propose is rather generic, and can be used to relax distri-
butional assumptions in essentially any parametric time-series model based on an exponential
family. The usefulness of the proposed approach in practice is demonstrated by ﬁtting it to the
polio dataset from Zeger (1988) as well as a more modern application to the Kings Cross assault
dataset from Men´endez et al. (2015).

2 Semiparametric GLMs for time-series data

Using the exponential tilt representation of Rathouz & Gao (2009), we can write model (1) as

Yt|Ft−1 ∼ exp(bt + θty)dF (y) ,

t = . . . , 0, 1, 2, . . . ,

(2)

3

where F is some response distribution, {bt} are normalization constants satisfying

bt = − log

exp(θty)dF (y) ,

t = . . . , 0, 1, 2 . . . ,

and the tilts {θt} are determined by the mean-model via

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

(3)

(4)

µt(β, γ) = E(Yt|Ft−1) =

y exp(bt + θty)dF (y) ,

t = . . . , 0, 1, 2, . . . .

This last equation can also be rearranged as

(cid:90)

0 =

[y − µt(β, γ)] exp(θty)dF (y) ,

t = . . . , 0, 1, 2 . . . ,

which avoids explicit dependence on bt.

Remark 1. Note that F is not the stationary distribution of the process. Rather, it is the underlying
distribution generating the exponential family.

Classical time-series models, such as those based on normal, Poisson or gamma distribu-
tions, can be recovered by setting F to be a normal, Poisson or gamma distribution, respectively.
The main advantage of the exponential tilt approach, however, is that the underlying distribu-
tion F can be left unspeciﬁed and instead treated as an inﬁnite-dimensional parameter along
with the usual mean-model parameters (β, γ) in the log-likelihood function,

n(cid:88)

l(β, γ, F ) =

{log dF (Yt) + bt + θtYt}

t=0

with bt given by (3) and θt given by (4), for t = 0, 1, . . . , n.

Treating F as a free parameter gives us much ﬂexibility in model speciﬁcation. For example,
overdispersed or underdispersed counts can be dealt with simply by F having heavier or lighter
tails than a nominal Poisson distribution. Similarly, zero-inﬂated data can be dealt with by
F having an additional probability mass at zero. Two examples of non-standard exponential
families covered by our framework are displayed in Fig. 1 in the Online Supplement. These
include a zero-inﬂated Poisson family and a normal-mixture family.

It is important to note that our framework is semiparametric as it contains inﬁnitely many
exponential families, one for each unique underlying distribution F . We are by no means re-
stricted to the handful of classical families, such as the normal, Poisson and gamma families.
Indeed, instead of specifying F a priori, the key innovation in this paper is to allow the underly-
ing distribution F to be estimated simultaneously along with β, thereby letting the data inform
us about which distribution ﬁts best. While there are conceivably many methods that can be
used to carry out this joint estimation, this paper proposes a maximum empirical likelihood ap-
proach. This is described in more detail in Section 3. Some other theoretical properties of the
model are given in the Appendix.

3 Estimation via maximum empirical likelihood

3.1 Methodology
To ﬁt model (2)–(4) to data, consider replacing the unknown dF with a probability mass function
j=0 pj = 1, so that the log-likelihood

{p0, . . . , pn} on the observed support Y0, . . . , Yn with (cid:80)n

4

becomes the following empirical log-likelihood:

l(β, γ, p) =

{log pt + bt + θtYt} ,

n(cid:88)

t=0

n(cid:88)

n(cid:88)

with bt = − log

and 0 =

exp(θtYj)pj ,

t = 0, 1, . . . , n ,

j=0

[Yj − µt(β, γ)] exp(θtYj)pj ,

t = 0, 1, . . . , n .

j=0

Note that equations (6) and (7) are the empirical versions of the normalization and mean con-
straints (3) and (4), respectively. A maximum empirical likelihood estimator (MELE) for (β, γ, p)
can then be deﬁned as

( ˆβ, ˆγ, ˆp) = argmaxβ,γ,pl(β, γ, p),

subject to constraints (6) and (7) and the corresponding MELE for F is given by the cumulative
sum

(5)

(6)

(7)

This also means that the MELE for the cdf of a particular response Yt is

ˆF (y) =

ˆpj1(Yj ≤ y) .

n(cid:88)

j=0

n(cid:88)

ˆFYt(y) =

ˆpj exp(bt + θtYj)1(Yj ≤ y).

j=0

Clearly the choice of regressors will have a big impact on the behaviour of µt(β, γ) and sub-
sequently the properties of the estimator. Davis, Dunsmuir & Wang (2000) and Davis & Wu
(2009) discuss a list of conditions such that a regressor can be incorporated. The conditions are
fairly general and hold for a wide range of covariates, including a trend function xnt = f (t/n)
where f (·) is a continuous function deﬁned on the unit interval [0, 1] and harmonics functions
that specify annual, seasonal or day-of-the-week effects.

The following theorem establishes a general consistency result for the proposed estimator.
In particular, it states that whenever consistency holds for the correctly-speciﬁed parametric
maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), then it also holds for the semiparametric MELE. The proof
of Theorem 1 is provided in the Supplementary Materials.

Theorem 1 (Consistency). Assume that the joint process (Yt, Wt) is stationary and uniformly ergodic,
and that conditions C1–C3 in Appendix A.2 hold. Then, whenever the (correctly-speciﬁed) parametric
MLE of (β, γ) is consistent, so is the semiparametric MELE ( ˆβ, ˆγ). Moreover, supy∈Y | ˆF (y)− F ∗(y)| → 0
in probability as n → ∞, where F ∗ is the true underlying distribution.

Establishing stationarity, ergodicity and consistency even in relatively simple parametric set-
tings is still ongoing research (e.g. Davis, Dunsmuir & Wang, 2000). Theorem 1 implies that
whenever advances are made about the consistency of particular parametric estimators, then
such results automatically apply to the semiparametric estimator also.

Note that our maximum empirical likelihood estimation scheme is generic for any mean-
model µt. Speciﬁc models for µt may require additional constraints and calculations, the com-
plexity of which depends on the complexity of the systematic and dependency structures of the
mean-model. To illustrate this, we make explicit below the optimization problem for computing
the semiparametric MELE for the GLARMA model from Example 3. A MATLAB program carry-
ing out these calculations can be found in spglarma3.m, which is obtainable by emailing the

5

authors. An alternative version, spglarma3par.m, utilizes the parallel computing toolbox for
faster computations. The corresponding calculations for the fully parametric Poisson model can
be found in Davis, Dunsmuir & Streett (2003, Section 3.1).

EXAMPLE 1.3 (continued). The constrained optimization problem for obtaining the MELE of
(β, φ, ψ, F ) in the GLARMA model of Davis, Dunsmuir & Streett (2003) with λ = 1/2 is:

The method of Creal, Koopman & Lucas (2008) can also be used.

3.2 Simulation Studies
To examine the practical performance of the proposed semiparametric MELE under both cor-
rect speciﬁcation and misspeciﬁcation, we simulate from different GLARMA models based on
Example 3 and compare the results with the MLE from parametric models.

The ﬁrst set of simulations is similar to those in Davis, Dunsmuir & Streett (2003) which is

based on a Poisson distribution with the log-link,

Yt|Ft−1 ∼ Poisson{µt = eWt},

under two settings, namely, one corresponding to a stationary trend,

Model 1: Wt = β0 + ψ(Yt−1 − eWt−1)e− 1

2 Wt−1 ,

and the other with a linear trend,

Model 2: Wt = β0 + β1t/n + ψ(Yt−1 − eWt−1)e− 1

2 Wt−1.

The sample sizes were n = 250 with N = 1000 replications for both settings. A burn-in period
of length 100 was used in the simulation of the realisations. For each simulated dataset, we

6

ﬁt both the correctly-speciﬁed Poisson model, via the glarma package in R of Dunsmuir, Li &
Scott (2014) with the default options (Pearson residuals and Fisher Scoring method), and the
semiparametric model, via the spglarma3par function in MATLAB.

The densities of the parameter estimates across the simulations for both methods are plot-
ted in Fig. 2 in the Online Supplement. As both models are correctly speciﬁed here, it is not
surprising to see they exhibit almost identical performance for estimating all model parameters.
It is perhaps more interesting to look at the performance of the estimators under model
misspeciﬁcation. To this end, a second set of simulations was carried out based on a negative-
binomial distribution with the log-link,

Yt|Ft−1 ∼ NegBin(µt = eWt, α),

such that the conditional density function of Yt is

P (Yt = yt|Ft−1) =

Γ(yt + α)
Γ(α)yt!

where

(cid:18) α

(cid:19)α(cid:18) µt

(cid:19)yt

,

for yt = 1, . . .,

Model 3: Wt = β0 + β1t/n + β2 cos(2πt/6) + β3 sin(2πt/6) + Zt,

Zt = φ(Zt−1 + et−1),

et−1 =

(cid:112)eWt−1 + e2Wt−1/α

Yt−1 − eWt−1

.

The linear predictor consists of a linear trend, two harmonic functions as well as an AR(1) com-
ponent. The sample size is n = 500 with N = 1000 replications. The parameter values are set
as (β0, β1, β2, β3, φ, α) =(0·1, 0·2, 0·3, 0·4, 0·25, 4). A burn-in period of length 100 was used in the
simulation of the realisations. Note that the negative-binomial distribution does not correspond
to a GLM unless the dispersion parameter α is known a priori.

For each simulated dataset, we ﬁt the correctly-speciﬁed negative-binomial model and the
misspeciﬁed Poisson model using the glarma package in R. We also ﬁt the proposed semipara-
metric model. The densities of the parameter estimates across the simulations for all three meth-
ods are plotted in Fig. 2. Although the misspeciﬁed Poisson model can give good estimates for
the regression coefﬁcients (β0, β1, β2, β3), it gives very different and severely biased estimates for
the autoregression coefﬁcient φ (see subpanel 5). Note that the autoregressive component of the
model here is intimately connected with the overall error structure, so it is perhaps not surpris-
ing that the misspeciﬁcation of the conditional error distribution has led to particularly poor
estimates of the autoregression parameter. In contrast, the proposed semiparametric method
gives almost identical estimates as the correctly-speciﬁed negative-binomial model for both the
regression and autoregressive coefﬁcients, demonstrating the robustness and ﬂexibility of the
proposed method under model misspeciﬁcation.

The semiparameteric approach is computationally more demanding than parametric ap-
proaches, for obvious reasons. Models 2 (n = 250) and 3 (n = 500) took, on average, 19 and
67 seconds (Macbook Pro, 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7, 16 GB 1600 RAM) to ﬁt, respectively, whereas
the glarma package took no more than a few seconds. The current software uses only the built-
in MATLAB optimizer fmincon, and we expect an improvement in computation times as we
implement our own algorithm.

binomial (dotted) models.

4 Inference via the likelihood ratio test

4.1 Methodology
For inferences on the model parameters (β, γ), Davis, Dunsmuir & Streett (2003, Section 3.1)
suggested inverting the numerical Hessian of the log-likelihood function at the MLE to estimate
its standard errors. Here, we propose a more direct method based on the likelihood ratio test.

Suppose we are interested in testing H0 : βk = 0 for some component of β. To do this, we
can ﬁt the semiparametric GLM with and without the constraint, obtaining the empirical log-
likelihood ratio test (LRT) statistic,

(cid:26)

(cid:27)

LRT = 2

l( ˆβ, ˆγ, ˆp) − sup

l(β, γ, p)

.

From this, we can compute an “equivalent standard error”, denoted by seeq, via

βk=0

(cid:32) ˆβk − 0

(cid:33)2

seeq

LRT =

and then construct 100(1 − α)% Wald-type conﬁdence intervals via the usual ˆβk ± zα/2seeq.
Note that the equivalent standard error is such that the corresponding z-test for testing βk = 0
achieves the same signiﬁcance level as the likelihood ratio test with a χ2
1 calibration. An identical
procedure can be applied for inferences on the components of the ARMA parameter γ.

In some scenarios, perhaps motivated by previous experience and/or theoretical arguments,
a null value other than 0 can be used to calculate an equivalent standard error, provided it does
not lie on the boundary of the parameter space. In the absence of any additional knowledge,
however, the choice of 0 seems a good default to use in practice, as supported by the simulation
results in Section 4.2.

4.2 Simulation Studies
To check the accuracy of the likelihood ratio test as the basis for inferences, the following two
expanded models were ﬁtted to the data generated by Model 1 in Section 3.2.1:

Model 1(cid:48): Wt = β0 + β1t/n + ψ(Yt−1 − eWt−1)e− 1

2 Wt−1,

and

Model 1(cid:48)(cid:48): Wt = β0 + ψ(Yt−1 − eWt−1)e− 1

2 Wt−1 + ψ2(Yt−2 − eWt−2)e− 1

2 Wt−2.

Note that the linear term β1t/n in Model 1(cid:48) and the second order MA component ψ2(Yt−2 −
eWt−2)e−Wt−2/2 in Model 1(cid:48)(cid:48) are redundant. This is equivalent to testing β1 = 0 and ψ2 = 0,
respectively.

If the proposed inferences based on the likelihood ratio test are to be useful, then the LRT
1 distributions. The Type I error rates for
statistic for both tests should have approximate χ2
testing β1 = 0 using the LRT at nominal 10%, 5% and 1% levels were 12.3%, 6.6% and 1.6%,
respectively, across 1000 simulations. The corresponding Type I errors for testing ψ2 = 0 were
10.0%, 6.0% and 1.2%, respectively. These results indicate that the asymptotic χ2 calibration is
quite accurate even for moderate sample sizes.

Next, we examine the performance of the proposed equivalent standard error approach for
constructing conﬁdence intervals for the parameters in the negative-binomial time-series gen-
erated by Model 3. The results from our simulation are reported in Table 1. We see that the
average equivalent standard errors are very close to their corresponding empirical standard de-
viations across the 1,000 parameter estimates. Table 1 also displays the coverage rates of 95%
Wald-type conﬁdence intervals using the equivalent standard error, with the results suggesting
that the proposed method performs as well as the correctly-speciﬁed negative-binomial model.
In contrast, the Poisson results are particularly poor and indicate that model misspeciﬁcation
can lead to severe biases for inferences on model parameters. This reiterates the value of ﬂexible

and robust modeling of the conditional error distribution. We can conclude that the semipara-
metric equivalent standard errors can be used in much the same way as (correctly-speciﬁed)
parametric standard errors for inferences on model parameters.

5 Data analysis examples

5.1 Polio dataset
To demonstrate the proposed method, we reanalyze the polio dataset studied by Zeger (1988),
which consists of monthly counts of poliomyelitis cases in the USA from year 1970 to 1983 as
reported by the Centres for Disease Control. Davis, Dunsmuir & Wang (2000) and Davis & Wu
(2009) modelled the counts using the Poisson and negative-binomial distributions, respectively.
Here, we specify the same set of covariates as in these earlier studies, with

xt = {1, t(cid:48)/1000, cos(2πt(cid:48)/12), sin(2πt(cid:48)/12), cos(2πt(cid:48)/6), sin(2πt(cid:48)/6)}T ,

where t(cid:48) = t− 73 is used to center the intercept term at January 1976. We specify a log-link and a
MA process with lags 1, 2 and 5, following the GLARMA approach of Davis, Dunsmuir & Wang
(2000).

The coefﬁcient estimates from the Poisson, negative-binomial and semiparametric ﬁt to the
data, along with their estimated standard errors, are reported in Table 2. Whilst the ﬁtted coef-
ﬁcients are quite similar for all three approaches, the estimated standard errors from the Pois-
son model are signiﬁcantly smaller than the other two. The larger standard errors from the
negative-binomial and semiparametric ﬁts reﬂect the overdispersion in the counts, as noted in
Davis, Dunsmuir & Wang (2000).

The estimated conditional response distributions for the 12th, 36th and 121st observations,
covering a range of conditional mean values, are displayed in panels (d)–(f) of Fig. 1. These plots
indicate that the semiparametric ﬁt to the data is distinctively different to both the Poisson and
negative-binomial ﬁts. We can also use histograms of the probability integral transformation
(PIT) to compare and assess the underlying distributional assumptions. The glarma package
uses the formulation in Czado, Gneiting & Held (2009) so that PIT can be applied to a discrete
distribution. If the distributional assumptions are correct, the histogram should resemble the
density function of a standard uniform distribution. As the estimated response distribution is

discrete under our semiparametric model, the implementation of PIT for our approach is also
straightforward. From the PITs of all three ﬁtted models, plotted in panels (a)–(c) of Fig. 1, we
see that the plot for the semiparametric model is closest to uniform, with the negative-binomial
and Poisson models being noticeably inferior. This suggest that neither parametric model is
adequate here. Subsequently, standard errors and inferences based on these parametric models
may well be biased and unreliable.

5.2 Kings Cross assault counts
Men´endez et al. (2015) recently studied the number of assaults in the Kings Cross area of Sydney.
A major practical question for which the data were originally collected was to determine the
effect of the January 2014 reforms to the NSW Liquor Act, designed to curb alcohol-related
violence, to the number of incidence of assault in Kings Cross, NSW, Australia. The data consists
of monthly counts of (police recorded non-domestic) assaults in the area from January 2009 to
September 2014. A state space Poisson model for count data of Durbin & Koopman (2012) was
used in the original study but we shall reexamine the data within the GLARMA framework.

We follow the original study by specifying a log-link and the same set of covariates which
includes an intercept, a step intervention term ( from January 2014 onwards), a cosine harmonic
term at a period of 12 months. Speciﬁcally,

xt = {1, I(t ≥ 60), cos(2πt/12)},

t = 0, 1, . . . 68,

where I(.) is an indicator function. A MA process with lags 1 and 2 was also included in the
model.

The data were ﬁt using a Poisson and the proposed semiparametric model. The coefﬁcient
estimates from the two models, along with their estimated standard errors, are reported in Table
3. Both models indicate that the step intervention term is highly signiﬁcant and the results
indicate that there has been substantial reduction in assault counts in the Kings Cross area.

We can again use histograms of the PIT to assess the Poisson distribution assumption. From
the PITs of the two models plotted in Fig. 3 we see that there is a distinct U-shape in the plot
for the Poisson model whereas the one for the semiparametric model appears closer to uniform.
This suggests that the Poisson error distribution model is inadequate here, so that corresponding
standard errors and subsequent inferences may well be biased.

Interestingly, a negative-binomial GLARMA model could not be ﬁtted to this dataset as the
Fisher Scoring algorithm failed to converge. We have yet to encounter any convergence or com-
patibility problems using our proposed method. Note that by leaving the underlying generating
distribution unspeciﬁed, our model ﬁtting algorithm is the same regardless of the distribution
of the data. We therefore do not run into such incompatibility issues.

6 Discussion

Misspecifying the conditional response distribution in GLARMA models can lead to biased esti-
mation of model parameters, especially parameters governing the dependence structure. This
problem of model misspeciﬁcation is particularly prevalent for responses that do not have con-
ditionally normal distributions, such as incidence counts. These types of time-series occur often
in population health and epidemiology.

The proposal in this paper is to use a semiparametric approach that maximizes over all pos-
sible exponential families of conditional distributions for the data in the GLARMA framework.
This allows for robust and ﬂexible models for non-Gaussian time-series data, as our simulations
and two data analysis examples demonstrate. The proposed approach is also a uniﬁed one,
covering the class of all GLARMA models that are based on an exponential family of conditional
distributions for the responses. Moreover, the same computational algorithm can be used to ﬁt
the model to data regardless of the underlying generating distribution of the data.

Appendix

A.1 Parameter space for F
As with any GLM, the underlying distribution F generating the exponential family is required to have
a Laplace transform in some neighborhood of the origin, so that the cumulant generating function (3) is
well-deﬁned. Note that F is not identiﬁable since any exponentially tilted version of F would generate
the same exponential family. To estimate F uniquely, we set b0 = θ0 = 0 in our MATLAB code.
The exponential tilt mechanism also implies that all observations Yt share a common support, Y – this
is another feature of GLMs . Binomial responses with varying number of trials may seem to violate this,
but they can be broken down into individual Bernoulli components each having common support {0, 1},
provided the number of trials at each time-point is given.

A.2 Regularity conditions
C1. The parameter space for (β, γ) is some compact subset of Rq+r.
C2. The response space Y is (contained in) some compact subset of R.
C3. The mean function µ(F; β, γ) maps into the interior of Y for all states F and all parameter values

(β, γ) in some neighbourhood of the true value (β∗, γ∗).

Remark 2. Condition C2 is for simplicity of proof and can be weakened to tightness on the collection of allowable
distributions. This then requires an additional step of approximating tight distributions by compactly-supported
ones, with the compact support being increasingly widened so that the approximation error becomes arbitrarily
small.

Remark 3. Condition C3 is required because we are not restricted to the canonical link for each exponential family.
For example, a linear mean model can be used with nonnegative responses, provided the mean µ(F; β, γ) is never
negative for any state F, at least for models (β, γ) sufﬁciently close to the underlying data-generating model
(β∗, γ∗).
