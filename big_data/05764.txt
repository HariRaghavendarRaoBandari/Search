Abstract

We propose that the contrasting low-temperature behaviors observed experimentally among
isostructural and isoelectronic materials, like non-superconducting and nonmagnetic MgFeGe, mag-
netically ordered NaFeAs, and superconducting LiFeAs, can be well understood from itinerant weak
coupling limit. We ﬁnd that stronger (π, π) instability appearing in the dx2−y2 orbital of NaFeAs is
responsible for the occurrence of weak magnetism while weaker but still prominent (π, π) instability
in LiFeAs leads to a superconducting state. In contrast, multiple competing instabilities coexist-
ing in orbital-resolved momentum-dependent susceptibilities, serving as magnetic frustrations from
itinerant electrons, may account for the nonmagnetic state in MgFeGe, while poorer Fermi surface
nesting leads to a non-superconducting state. Based on above ﬁndings, we predict a possible way
to make MgFeGe a new Fe-based superconductor.

INTRODUCTION

Intensive debates persist since the discovery of High-
Tc iron-based superconductors on how to understand the
origin of magnetism and superconductivity, either from
strong coupling localized limit or from weak coupling itin-
erant limit1–18. Among various successfully synthesized
iron-based compounds, several of them are presumed to
be the counterexamples against the itinerant scenario,
such as potassium doped iron selenides19,20 and iron tel-
lurides21,22. However, on one hand, it is still unresolved
experimentally which is the parent compound for super-
conductivity in potassium doped iron selenides due to
the coexistence of diﬀerent types of iron vacancy order
and superlattices23–28. Therefore it remains unknown if
the itinerant scenario is really inapplicable to the potas-
sium doped iron selenides. On the other hand, it has
been shown from a density functional theory (DFT) cal-
culation that the unique antiferromagnetism with double
stripe observed in iron tellurides can be well interpreted
from itinerant picture as long as excess interstitial irons
are properly taken into account29.

MgFeGe, a new candidate of 111 family of iron-based
superconductors in addition to LiFeAs and NaFeAs, now
becomes another possible counterexample against the
itinerant scenario. From experiments, it is found that
MgFeGe is nonmagnetic and non-superconducting down
to 2 K30, in contrast to LiFeAs which is a good supercon-
ductor with Tc = 18 K31 and to NaFeAs which shows a
magnetically driven structural phase transition above the
superconducting transition32. However, surprisingly, not
only the lattice structures but also the electronic struc-
tures like band dispersions and Fermi surfaces of MgFeGe
are all similiar to those of LiFeAs30. Furthermore, a
quantitative calculation on momentum dependent Pauli
susceptibility within constant matrix elements approxi-
mation showed that the (π, π) instability which is respon-
sible for stripe-type antiferromagnetic order or supercon-

ductivity is even stronger in MgFeGe than in LiFeAs33,
indicating that from itinerant point of view MgFeGe is
more likely a superconductor or an antiferromagnet. This
is inconsistent with the experimental ﬁndings. As a re-
sult, the applicability of weak coupling approach to the
origin of magnetism or superconductivity in iron-based
compounds is again questionable.

Recently, Jeschke, et al.34 emphasized the importance
of looking at magnetism in MgFeGe. Based on a DFT
calculation where spin polarized generalized gradient ap-
proximation (GGA) is used, it was pointed out that the
ground state of MgFeGe is ferromagnetically ordered if
the experimental lattice structure is used, indicating that
strong ferromagnetic ﬂuctuations might be the reason for
non-superconducting and nonmagnetic state. However,
the result is inconsistent with existing ones. First, it was
previously reported by applying similar calculations that
the ground state of MgFeGe is of stripe-type antiferro-
magnetic order if optimized lattice structure is used30.
Second, the calculated Pauli susceptibility doesn’t show
any instabilities at wave vector of (0, 0)33, indicating that
there is no strong ferromagnetic ﬂuctuation in the para-
magnetic state.

Furthermore, we apply both GGA and local density ap-
proximation (LDA) to the DFT calculations35 and ﬁnd
that the nature of the ground state is strongly dependent
on the functionals one chooses (see Table I and discus-
sion below). As is well known that, while GGA usually
underestimates the binding energy, LDA does in the op-
posite way. Thus, the contradiction between the results
from GGA and LDA, together with the above mentioned
conﬂicts, strongly imply that a new theory, which can
eliminate all the inconsistencies, has to be established
to understand the mechanism for the diﬀerent behaviors
among these isostructural and isoelectronic compounds.
In this paper, we will show that the diﬀerences among
MgFeGe, LiFeAs and NaFeAs can be well explained from
weak coupling limit irrespective of the functionals one

uses if intraorbital contributions to the particle-hole scat-
tering are individually considered. The presence or the
absence of (π, π) instability, which is widely accepted
to be responsible for appearance and disappearance of
the magnetism or superconductivity, in the dx2−y2 or-
bital plays a dominant role in determining the low-
temperature behaviors of these three compounds. While
NaFeAs and LiFeAs show stronger and weaker, but both
prominent, (π, π) instabilities in dx2−y2 orbital, respec-
tively, MgFeGe exhibits multiple competing instabilities
in the momentum space. As a consequence, NaFeAs is
magnetically ordered at low temperature while MgFeGe
is nonmagnetic. Moreover, the poorer Fermi surface nest-
ing in MgFeGe than in superconducting LiFeAs leads to
a non-superconducting state in MgFeGe. Finally, we pre-
dict that electron doping, such as substitution of Mg by
Al or La, will be an eﬃcient way to make MgFeGe a new
iron-based superconductor.

II. RESULTS

A. Energies of various spin conﬁgurations

First, we present comparisons of total energies among
diﬀerent types of magnetically ordered states, such as
1) N´eel state with intralayer N´eel antiferromagnetic
and interlayer ferromagnetic ordering, 2) double stripe
state with intralayer double-stripe-type antiferromag-
netic and interlayer ferromagnetic ordering, 3) stripe
state with intralayer stripe-type antiferromagnetic and
interlayer ferromagnetic ordering, 4) ferromagnetic state
with both interlayer and intralayer ferromagnetic order-
ing, and 5) N´eel(II) state with intralayer N´eel antifer-
romagnetic but interlayer antiferromagnetic ordering, 6)
double stripe(II) state with intralayer double-stripe-type
antiferromagnetic but interlayer antiferromagnetic order-
ing, 7) stripe(II) state with intralayer stripe-type anti-
ferromagnetic but interlayer antiferromagnetic ordering,
8) ferromagnetic(II) states with intralayer ferromagnetic

but interlayer antiferromagnetic ordering.

The results are summarized in Table I. The ﬁrst four
magnetic states are corresponding to those studied in
Ref. 34. It is found that the total energies of these four
states obtained within GGA are consistent with previ-
ous results although full potential linearized augmented
plane wave method as implemented in WIEN2k is used
here instead of full potential localized orbital method
used in Ref. 34.
Indeed, the ferromagnetic state gives
lowest total energy. However, if we compare the total
energies among these four states obtained within LDA,
the ground state is dramatically changed to stripe state,
indicating the strong dependence of the spin state on
the functionals. Furthermore, we investigate the eﬀect of

spin conﬁgurations from ferromagnetic to antiferromag-
netic arrangements. It is shown that the stripe(II) state
with intralayer stripe-type antiferromagnetic and inter-
layer antiferromagnetic ordering gives the lowest total
energy, regardless of the functionals one chooses. On the
other hand, we also calculate the total energies of stripe
state and ferromagneitc state based on optimized lat-
tice structures within both GGA and LDA. We ﬁnd the
stripe-type antiferromagnetic state always prevails over
the ferromagnetic one. In fact, this result is consistent
with the weak coupling theory within constant matrix
elements approximation where strong (π, π) instability
is observed in the momentum-dependent Pauli suscepti-
bility (See Fig. 1 (a)) which implies a strong tendency
toward stripe-type antiferromagnetic state in MgFeGe.
Then, the question remains, why neither magnetization
nor superconductivity is observed experimentally? Does
it really suggest that MgFeGe do serve as a true coun-
terexample against the itinerant scenario?

B. Theory from itinerant scenario

The above problems can be resolved after orbital con-
tributions to the Pauli susceptibility are properly taken
into account. The Pauli susceptibility37 is deﬁned as

where matrix elements as
bital and the band spaces and are the components of
the eigenvectors obtained from diagonalization of an ef-
fective tight-binding Hamiltonian derived from the DFT
band structure via construction of Wannier orbitals38,39.
Here f (E) is the Fermi distribution function, p, r, s, t are
the orbital indices and µ, ν the band indices.

The crude approximation of constant matrix elements
assumes that all the orbitals give the same contributions
to each band at every k point by taking all the matrix
elements to be 1, which results in the inconsistencies be-
tween the weak coupling theory and the experiments. As
can be seen in Fig. 1 (a), all three compounds exhibit
prominent instability at (π, π) and the instability is even
stronger in MgFeGe than in LiFeAs.

However, the situation is dramatically changed if the
approximation is removed. Since the magnetism and the
superconductivity are dominated by the intraorbital scat-
tering29,40,41, we only show in Fig. 2 the intraorbital con-
tributions to the Pauli susceptibility. Figs. 2 (a), (b),
and (c) present the orbital-resolved susceptibilities along
the path in the momentum space of (0, 0)-(π, 0)-(π, π)-
(0, 0) for NaFeAs, LiFeAs, and MgFeGe, respectively. It
is found that, on one hand, all three compounds possess
a common feature that the susceptibilities of dxy and dz2
orbitals are much smaller than those of dx2−y2 , dxz, and

3

dyz orbitals, indicating that the physical properties are
mainly controlled by the latter three orbitals. Here x,
y, z are along a, b, c directions of the original unit cell
with two iron atoms, respectively. On the other hand, re-
markable diﬀerences can be observed among these three
compounds. While dx2−y2 orbital exhibits strong insta-
bility at wave vector of (π, π) in NaFeAs (see also Fig. 2
(d)), implying a strong tendency toward the stripe-type
antiferromagnetic ordering, the instability of dx2−y2 or-
bital in LiFeAs is signiﬁcantly suppressed (see also Fig. 2
(e)). Since appearance of magnetism requires an instabil-
ity exactly at (π, π) stronger than a threshold, remaining
peaks around (π, π) in all three orbitals (dx2−y2, dxz, and
dyz) of LiFeAs (see Fig. 2 (b)) indicate a tendency to-
ward superconductivity at suﬃciently low temperature.
Nevertheless, the behavior of Pauli susceptibility within
constant matrix element approximation in NaFeAs and
LiFeAs as shown in Fig. 1 (a) still qualitatively reﬂects
the fact that the orbitally resolved susceptibilities tell as
presented in Figs. 2 (a) and (b).

In MgFeGe, drastic diﬀerences can be detected be-
tween the Pauli susceptibility within constant matrix el-
ement approximation and the orbitally resolved suscep-
tibility. While a strong and broadened peak is present
at (π, π) in the Pauli susceptibility within constant ma-
trix element approximation as shown in Fig. 1 (a), mul-
tiple competing humps appear in all the dominating in-
traorbital contributions to the susceptibility as shown in
Fig. 2 (c).
In other words, no prominent peak can be
found in the susceptibilities of dyz/xz and dx2−y2 orbitals,
compared to those in NaFeAs and LiFeAs (see Figs. 2
(a) and (b)).
If it would be acceptable that multiple
weak humps appearing at momentum vectors of (π, 0),
(0, π) and (π, π) in dx2−y2 and dxz/yz orbitals can still be
viewed as the evidence for the weak and competing ten-
dency towards various magnetic ordered states, it would
be still understandable why the total energies of double-
stripe-type and stripe-type antiferromagnetic states are
quite close in both spin polarized GGA and LSDA cal-
culations (see Table I) and why those states give second
lowest and lowest total energies, respectively, in LSDA
calculations. This is due to the fact that the dynamical
ﬂuctuations are completely ignored in the DFT calcula-
tions. If the dynamical ﬂuctuations among various quan-
tum states are switched on, any instabilities with compa-
rable strength at diﬀerent momentum vectors as present
in the orbitally resolved susceptibilities in MgFeGe can
not win the competition against the others at low tem-
perature, which should be the reason from weak coupling
itinerant limit why MgFeGe remains nonmagnetic at low
temperature.

In Fig 1 (b), we present the intra-orbital Pauli sus-
ceptibilities of dx2−y2 at (π, π) as a function of width of
the energy window chosen around Fermi level. It is found
that the susceptibility of MgFeGe calculated within large
energy window is larger than that of LiFeAs, while it
surprisingly becomes smaller as the energy window is
shrunk. Since the Pauli susceptibility within small energy

window chosen in the vicinity of the Fermi level reﬂects
the nesting properties of the Fermi surface, our results
strongly indicate that MgFeGe is not a superconductor
due to the poorer Fermi surface nesting than LiFeAs.
Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the Pauli susceptibilities of
dxz/yz orbitals at (π, π) remain almost the same between
LiFeAs and MgFeGe within small energy window, im-
plying that dx2−y2 orbital dominates the contrast low
temperature behaviors of MgFeGe, LiFeAs, and NaFeAs.

C. Predictions

From above comparisons between diﬀerent compounds
and the analyses on the orbitally resolved susceptibility,
we learn that a pronounce instability around (π, π) in
the orbitally resolved susceptibility is the precursor for
the superconducting state in MgFeGe. Therefore, in or-
der to make MgFeGe a possible new iron-based supercon-
ductor, we try diﬀerent ways to increase the instability
around (π, π) in MgFeGe, such as shift the Fermi level
up and down which can be viewed as electron and hole
doping, respectively, as well as move the Ge atom close
to or away from Fe plane which can be viewed as apply-
ing chemical or external pressure. We ﬁnd that lifting
the Fermi level up, served as electron doping, is an ef-
ﬁcient way to enhance the instability around (π, π) in
dx2−y2 orbital. As shown in Fig 3, we shift the Fermi
level up by 20, 40, 60, and 80 meV, which is correspond-
ing to dope 0.05, 0.11, 0.16, 0.21 electrons per Fe. It is
found that in both dx2−y2 and dyz orbitals, multiple-peak

structures with peaks of comparable strength appearing
in the undoped case (see the black line in Fig 3 (a) and
(b)) vanishes.
Instead, prominent peaks around (π, π)
and (π, 0) occur in dx2−y2 and dyz orbitals, respectively,
due to the suppression of other peaks as electron doping
increases. Nevertheless, the peak around (π, 0) in dyz is
weaker and more broadened than that around (π, π) in
dx2−y2, inferring that the instability around (π, π) may
play a dominating role in determining the low tempera-
ture physics and consequently lead to a possible super-
conducting state as the Fermi surface nesting becomes
better (See Fig 1 (b)).

III. DISCUSSIONS

In fact, preliminary eﬀort has been made in looking for
a superconducting state in MgFeGe. However, it is failed
after electron doping by cobalt and hole doping in the
form of Mg1−xFeGe30. In our calculations, hole doping
will signiﬁcantly enhance the ferromagnetic instability in
dxz/yz orbital but slightly enhance the stripe-type an-
tiferromagnetic instability in dx2−y2 orbital, resulting in
the failure of hole doping. On the other hand, it is known
from a ﬁrst principles investigation that Co substitution
of Fe will impose disorder eﬀect on the parent compound
and does not merely change the carrier density42. Thus,
we propose based on our above investigation that it would
be an eﬃcient way to do an electron doping by increas-
ing the content of Mg or in the form of Mg1−xAlxFeGe,
Mg1−xLaxFeGe, etc.

large U favors the ferromagnetic solution45,46. Third, it
is always a problem in determining precisely the Fermi
level or the ﬁlling in LDA+DMFT calculations. As we
know from our orbitally resolved susceptibility calcula-
tions, slightly shifting downward the Fermi level will en-
hance the ferromagnetic instability.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

1) We show that the contrasting low-temperature be-
haviors among MgFeGe, LiFeAs, and NaFeAs are domi-
nated by the distinct structures of the intraorbital con-
tributions to the particle-hole scattering from dx2−y2 or-
bital. This implies that an eﬀective single orbital model
may be suﬃcient to capture physics of the 111 family
of iron-based superconductors which possess complicated
band structures compared to those of high-Tc cuprates.
Moreover, competing instabilities coexisting in the same
orbitals which can be eﬀectively viewed as the magnetic
frustrations from itinerant electrons may also be applica-
ble to understand other iron-based superconductors with
nonmagnetic parent states. 2) Our results resolve the
existing confusions in 111 family of iron-based supercon-
ductors and indicate that the physics of iron-based super-
conductors can be understood from weak coupling itin-
erant limit where electronic correlations play subsidiary
roles. 3) We propose a possible way to synthesize a new
iron-based superconductor based on the calculations of
electron doping to MgFeGe. As our results are robust
irrespective of the functionals one chooses, in contrast to
the previous consensus that LDA and GGA give incon-
sistent answers47, we propose that investigating the in-
traorbital particle-hole scattering can capture the overall
trends in the same family of iron-based superconductors
and should be a promising way for understanding exist-
ing or predicting new iron-based superconductors.

X(π, 0)-M (π, π)-Γ(0, 0).

Recently, an LDA+DMFT method has been applied to
study the spin dynamics in MgFeGe43. It is found that
spin ﬂuctuations are ferromagnetic. However, ﬁrst, it is
hard to believe that a local and q-independent correction
due to the electronic interactions will generate dramat-
ically an instability at (0, 0) which doesn’t exist in zero
order susceptibility while suppress all the others. Sec-
ond, the Hubbard U interaction used in the LDA+DMFT
study is 5 eV which is too large compared to the U values
derived from a constrained random phase approximation
method for LiFeAs44. Moreover, our constrained LDA
calculations show that the local interaction U is slightly
smaller in MgFeGe than in LiFeAs. As is well-known
from the mean-ﬁeld phase diagram of Hubbard model,

35 We use experimental crystal structures of MgFeGe30,
LiFeAs31 and NaFeAs32. The full potential linearized aug-
mented plane wave method as implemented in wien2k36 is
employed to calculate the electronic structures. The tetra-
hedron method is used and a mesh with total 40000 k
points is sampled for Brillouin-zone integration in both the
nonmagnetic and diﬀerent spin conﬁguration calculations.
