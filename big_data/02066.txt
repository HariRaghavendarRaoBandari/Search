ON THE SYMMETRIC SQUARES OF

COMPLEX AND QUATERNIONIC PROJECTIVE SPACE

YUMI BOOTE AND NIGEL RAY

Abstract. The problem of computing the integral cohomology ring of the
symmetric square of a topological space has been of interest since the 1930s,
but limited progress has been made on the general case until recently. In
this work we oﬀer a solution for the complex and quaternionic projective
spaces KP n, by taking advantage of their rich geometrical structure. Our
description is in terms of generators and relations, and our methods entail
ideas that have appeared in the literature of quantum chemistry, theoret-
ical physics, and combinatorics. We deal ﬁrst with the case KP ∞, and
proceed by identifying the truncation required for passage to ﬁnite n. The
calculations rely upon a ladder of long exact cohomology sequences, which
arises by comparing coﬁbrations associated to the diagonals of the symmetric
square and the corresponding Borel construction. The coﬁbrations involve
classic conﬁguration spaces of unordered pairs of 1-dimensional subspaces
of Kn+1, and their one-point compactiﬁcations; the latter are identiﬁed as
Thom spaces by combining L¨owdin’s symmetric orthogonalisation process
(and its quaternionic extension) with a dash of Pin geometry. The ensuing
integral cohomology rings may be conveniently expressed using generalised
Fibonacci polynomials. By way of validation, we note that our conclusions
are compatible with mod 2 computations of Nakaoka and with homological
results of Milgram.

1. Introduction

The study of cyclic and symmetric powers has a long and varied history,
and has remained active throughout the extensive development of algebraic
topology since the 1930s. At ﬁrst, symmetric squares of smooth manifolds were
associated mainly with critical point theory [29], but by the 1950s cyclic powers
of simplicial complexes had come to underlie Steenrod’s construction of mod p
cohomology operations [36] and related work on the homology and cohomology
of the symmetric groups [32]. These interactions were extended to stable split-
tings of classifying spaces during the 1980s [28]. More recently [20], symmetric
powers of smooth manifolds M have been viewed as compactiﬁcations of con-
ﬁguration spaces of ﬁnite sets of distinct points on M , and also as important
examples of orbifolds [1]. Since 2000 or so, the latter perspective has gained
popularity within theoretical physics [7], where they are referred to as cyclic or
permutation orbifolds.

For any topological space X, its cyclic or symmetric square SP 2(X) is the
orbit space (X × X)/C2 under the action of the cyclic group C2, generated by
the involution ι that interchanges the factors X. Its elements are the unordered
pairs {x, y} for all x, y in X, and the ﬁxed points of ι determine the diagonal
subspace ∆ = ∆(X), which contains all pairs {x, x} and is homeomorphic to
X. If X is a CW complex of ﬁnite type, then so is SP 2(X), and this condition
holds for every space considered below. The quotient map q : X ×X → SP 2(X)
is a ramiﬁed covering in the sense of [35], and its oﬀ-diagonal restriction

(1.1)
is a genuine double covering. By deﬁnition, the codomain SP 2(X) \ ∆ is the
conﬁguration space C2(X) of unordered pairs of distinct points of X.

q : (X × X) \ ∆ −→ SP 2(X) \ ∆

In a small number of special cases, SP 2(X) may be identiﬁed with some

other familiar space. For example, there are homeomorphisms

(1.2)

SP 2(S1) ∼= M¨o, SP 2(RP 2) ∼= RP 4

and SP 2(S2) ∼= CP 2,

where M¨o is the closed M¨obius band. In these cases, the integral cohomology
ring H ∗(SP 2(X)) is well-known; but its evaluation presents a greater challenge
for arbitrary X, and few complete calculations appear in the literature.

Nevertheless, two advances have been made since this manuscript was be-
gun. Firstly, the torsion free quotient ring H ∗(SP 2(X))/ Tor was computed by
Gugnin [15] for any CW complex of ﬁnite type, using the transfer homomor-
phism [35] associated to q. Secondly, Milgram’s description [24] of the integral
homology groups H∗(SP 2(X)) was converted into dualisable form by Totaro
[37, Theorem 1.2], for any ﬁnite CW complex such that H∗(X) is torsion free
and concentrated in even dimensions. At these levels of generality, however,
the results are necessarily intricate, and reinforce our belief that, in favourable
cases, H ∗(SP 2(X)) may best be understood in terms of the geometry of X.

The most basic examples are spheres, which were studied by Morse in [29,
Chapter VI §11], and by Nakaoka in a sequence of papers including [31]. Spheres
apart, the complex and quaternionic projective spaces KP n are good candidates
for families of well-behaved CW complexes with rich unstable geometry. Our
main algebraic result is the following distillation of Theorem 8.18, which de-
scribes the unreduced integral cohomology ring H ∗(SP 2(KP n)+) by means of
generators and relations. The dimensions of the generators depend on the di-
mension d of K over R; thus d = 2 for K = C or 4 for K = H, and g, h, and ui,j
have dimensions d, 2d, and 2i + jd + 1 respectively.

Theorem 1.3. For any n ≥ 1, the ring H ∗(SP 2(KP n)+) is isomorphic to

Z[hp/2p−1, gqhs/2s, ui,j] / J ′
where p, q ≥ 1, s ≥ 0 and 0 < i < jd/2; the ideal J ′

n ,
n is given by

(2ui,j, ui,juk,l, ui,jhp/2p−1, ui,jgqhs/2s, rn+t, ui,j : t ≥ 1, j > n) ,

for certain homogeneous integral polynomials rk = rk(g, h) of dimension kd.

The torsion-free product structure is indicated by the form of the monomial
generators; for example, g · h = 2 · gh/2 in H 3d(SP 2(KP n)), for any n ≥ 2. This
structure is compatible with [15, Theorem 1].

A crucial supporting rˆole in these calculations is played by a homotopy the-
oretic analogue of SP 2(X), namely the Borel construction S∞ ×C2 (X × X),
where C2 acts antipodally on the contractible sphere S∞, and therefore freely.

It contains the diagonal subspace RP ∞ × X, sometimes written as b∆ = b∆(X).

There is a Borel bundle

k
−→ S∞ ×C2 (X × X)

X × X

(1.4)
in which π1(RP ∞) ∼= C2 acts on the ﬁbre by ι. The integral cohomology ring
H ∗(S∞ ×C2 (X × X)) may be computed via the Leray-Serre spectral sequence
of (1.4) in favourable cases, as for X = KP n in Theorem 8.8 below.

−→ RP ∞,

r

There is also a canonical projection map

(1.5)

π : S∞ ×C2 (X × X) −→ SP 2(X),

which identiﬁes b∆ with π−1(∆); its oﬀ-diagonal restriction
π′ : S∞ ×C2 (X × X) \ b∆ −→ SP 2(X) \ ∆

(1.6)

is a ﬁbration with contractible ﬁbres, and hence a homotopy equivalence. The
Vietoris-Begle theorem shows that (1.5) induces an isomorphism

(1.7)

π∗ : H ∗(SP 2(X); Z[1/2]) −→ H ∗(S∞ ×C2 (X × X); Z[1/2]),

so the main diﬃculties in proving Theorem 8.18 involve 2-torsion and 2-primary
product structure. The properties of (1.6) ensure that the induced map

(1.8)

π′′ : S∞ ×C2 (X × X)/ b∆ −→ SP 2(X)/∆

of quotient spaces is also a homotopy equivalence, allowing cohomological prop-
erties of the Borel construction to be related directly to those of SP 2(X), as in
Bredon [8, Chapter VII].

For X = KP n, this relationship makes use of Pin geometry. Because KP n
is closed, compact and admits a suitable metric, ∆ is a canonical deformation
retract of a certain singular open neighbourhood [21, Corollary 4.2]. It turns
out that SP 2(KP n) \ ∆ contains an analogous closed, compact submanifold Γn,
which is a deformation retract; it may be thought of as an anti-diagonal. The
retraction is canonical because SP 2(KP n)\∆ is diﬀeomorphic to the total space
of a Pin ‡(d) vector bundle θn over Γn, where ‡ stands for c when d = 2, or −
when d = 4 [16, §2]. In terms of (1.8), SP 2(KP n)/∆ is therefore the Thom space
of θn, whose cohomological structure helps to unlock the 2-primary information.
The relationship between Pin−(4) and Pin+(4) has been clariﬁed in the physics
literature [4, §5.3], but continues to cause confusion elsewhere.

Our plan of action is inspired by two sources. One is James, Thomas, Toda,
and Whitehead [19], who described SP 2(Sn)/∆ as a Thom space over RP n;
our methods apply equally well to their situation, and recover H ∗(SP 2(Sn))
for n ≥ 1. The other is Yasui [38], who introduced Stiefel manifolds into his
determination of H ∗(C2(CP n)), and built on Feder’s mod 2 calculations [13].
Recently, Dominguez, Gonzalez and Landweber [12] computed H ∗(C2(RP n)),
so the quaternionic case of Theorem 8.1 completes the trio.

The fact that H ∗(KP n) ∼= Z[z]/(zn+1) is the truncation of H ∗(KP ∞) sug-
gests that it should also be possible to calculate H ∗(SP 2(KP ∞)), and express

4

YUMI BOOTE AND NIGEL RAY

H ∗(SP 2(KP n) as an appropriate quotient. This is indeed the case, and occu-
pies the second half of Theorem 8.18. It is of interest to note that Γ := Γ∞ is
actually a model for the classifying space BPin ‡(d), which provides a convenient
point of departure for §2.

There are seven sections, and an Appendix of low dimensional tables.

7. Mod 2 truncation
8. Integral truncation,

Several of our mod 2 results could have been deduced directly from Nakaoka’s
classic work [30], [31], so it is reassuring to conﬁrm that our answers agree with
his. Similarly, the additive structure exhibited in Theorem 1.3 may readily be
reconciled with Milgram’s description [24] of H∗(SP 2(KP n)).

The results for HP n appear in the ﬁrst author’s PhD thesis [5], and were
presented in August 2014 as a contributed talk at the Seoul ICM. They were
originally intended for application to quaternionic cobordism; that work remains
in progress, along with extensions to other cohomology theories and higher
cyclic powers. The geometry associated to the case of the octonionic projective
plane is especially attractive, and will be described in a forthcoming note [6].

The authors wish to thank Andrew Baker for his ongoing interest and en-

couragement, and Larry Taylor for helpful comments on Pin±(k).

2. Classifying spaces and Pin†(d) bundles

This section establishes notation that allows the complex and quaternionic
cases to be treated simultaneously, and collates background information on cer-
tain low dimensional compact Lie groups. The aim is to contextualise Pinc(2)
and Pin±(4); the latter requires special care, having been the subject of several
ambiguities in the literature. Background sources include [33] for quaternionic
linear algebra, [3] for the accidental isomorphisms from a quaternionic view-
point, and [38] for aspects of the complex case.

Henceforth, K denotes the complex numbers C or the quaternions H, and d
stands for their respective dimensions 2 or 4, as real vector spaces. Scalars act
on the right of vector spaces over K, unless otherwise stated; thus GL(n, K)
act on the left of Kn, whose elements are column vectors. By deﬁnition, the
compact Lie group OK(n) < GL(n, K) consists of all matrices Q that preserve
the Hermitian inner product

hu, vi = ¯u1v1 + · · · + ¯unvn = u⋆v

on Kn, where ⋆ denotes conjugate transpose. Such matrices are characterised
by the property that Q−1 = Q⋆; in particular, OK(n) is the unitary group U (n)
or the symplectic group Sp(n), over C or H respectively.

When n = 2 there exist important accidental isomorphisms
Sp(2) ∼= Spin(5).

U (2) ∼= Spinc(3)

(2.1)

and

They may be understood in terms of the real (d + 1)-dimensional vector space

(2.2)

HK(2) = (cid:26)(cid:18)r

¯k −r(cid:19) : (r, k) ∈ R × K(cid:27)

k

of 2 × 2 Hermitian matrices with zero trace, on which OK(2) acts on the left by

(2.3)
for any Z in HK(2). This provides the action of Spinc(3) on R3 or Spin(5) on R5,
although the former is often given by the equivalent action on skew -Hermitian
matrices.

Q · Z = QZQ⋆

For any n ≥ 2, let Vn+1,2 denote the Stiefel manifold of orthonormal 2-frames
in Kn+1; it is a closed compact manifold of dimension (2n + 1)d − 2, whose
elements are speciﬁed by (n + 1) × 2 matrices (u v) over K, with orthonormal
columns. The group OK(2) acts freely on the right, and has orbit space the
Grassmannian Grn+1,2. For n = ∞, the colimit V2 : = V∞,2 is contractible, and
Gr2 : = Gr∞,2 serves as a classifying space BOK(2). In view of the accidental
isomorphism (2.1), BOK(2) is BSpinc(3) or BSpin(5), and the associated real
(d + 1)-plane bundle χ is induced by the action (2.3). Of course BOK(2) also
admits the standard universal K2 bundle ω2, which are written as ζ2 over BU (2)
or ξ2 over BSp(2) in §4.

Note that OK(1) is the unit sphere and multiplicative subgroup Sd−1 < K×,
and BOK(1) is the projective space KP ∞, with tautological line bundle ω = ω1;
the latter is written as ζ over CP ∞ or ξ over HP ∞. Thus Sd−1× Sd−1 < OK(2)
is the subgroup of diagonal matrices, and isomorphic to Spinc(2) or Spin(4).

Deﬁnitions 2.4. The subgroup P d < OK(2) consists of all matrices

the subgroups F d : = C2 × Sd−1 and Sd−1 × Sd−1 < P d consist of matrices

(cid:26)(cid:18)a 0
0 b(cid:19) ,(cid:18)0 a
b 0(cid:19) : a, b ∈ Sd−1(cid:27) ;
a 0(cid:19) : a ∈ Sd−1(cid:27) and (cid:26)(cid:18)a 0

(cid:26)(cid:18)a 0
0 a(cid:19) ,(cid:18)0 a

0 b(cid:19) : a, b ∈ Sd−1(cid:27)

respectively, where C2 is generated by τ : = ( 0 1

1 0 ).

Remarks 2.5. The group P d is the normalizer of Sd−1 × Sd−1 in OK(2), and
may be interpreted as the wreath product Sd−1 ≀ C2. As such, it is isomorphic
to the compact Lie group Pin ‡(d), where ‡ stands for c when d = 2, or − when
d = 4 [16, §2]. This description motivates our notation, and is valid because
Pin ‡(d) is the normalizer of Spin ‡(d) in Spin ‡(d + 1), and Spin − = Spin.

The left action (2.3) of P d on R × K is made explicit by

(2.6)

τ · (r, k) = (−r, ¯k)

and

This splits as the product of the actions on R by det, and on Rd ∼= K by

(2.7)

τ · k = ¯k

and

(cid:18)a 0
0 b(cid:19) · (r, k) = (r, ak¯b) .
(cid:18)a 0
0 b(cid:19) · k = ak¯b .

Proposition 2.8. There are homeomorphisms of left coset spaces

(1) OK(2)/(Sd−1 × Sd−1) ∼= Sd,
(3) P d/F d ∼= Sd−1 and

(2) OK(2)/P d ∼= RP d,
(4) P d/(Sd−1 × Sd−1) ∼= C2.

Proof. For (1), observe that the left action (2.3) of OK(2) on Sd ⊂ R × K is
transitive, and (1, 0) has isotropy subgroup Sd−1× Sd−1. The induced action of
OK(2) on RP d is also transitive, and (2) holds because τ · (1, 0) = (−1, 0) and
[1, 0] has isotropy group P d. For (3), note that the left action (2.7) of P d on
Sd−1 ⊂ K is transitive, and 1 has isotropy subgroup F d. Finally, Sd−1 × Sd−1
is normal in P d, and the quotient C2 is generated by the image of τ ; so (4) is
the induced isomorphism of topological groups.
(cid:3)

Any closed subgroup H of a compact Lie group G gives rise to a bundle

(2.9)

G/H i−→ BH

p

−→ BG,

in which p is modelled by the natural projection EG/H → EG/G; see [26,
Chapter II], for example. So Proposition 2.8 has the following consequences.

Corollary 2.10. There exist bundles

(1) Sd −→ B(Sd−1 × Sd−1)

p1−→ BOK(2), (2) RP d

i2−→ BP d p2−→ BOK(2),

(3) Sd−1 −→ BF d p3−→ BP d, (4) C2 −→ B(Sd−1 × Sd−1)

p4−→ BP d,

where (1) is the sphere bundle of χ, (2) is the projectivisation of χ, (3) is the
sphere bundle of the universal Pin ‡(d) vector d-plane bundle θ, and (4) is the
double covering associated to the determinant line bundle det(θ).

Proof. The homeomorphisms of Proposition 2.8 associate the left actions of
OK(2) on the coset spaces (1) and (2) to their left actions on Sd and RP d, as
given by (2.3); and the left actions of P d on the coset spaces (3) and (4) to
their left actions on Sd−1 and C2, as given by (2.7).
(cid:3)

Remarks 2.11. The proof of Corollary 2.10 uses the orbit space

(2.12)

Γ : = V2/P d = {[u], [v] : u, v ∈ S∞, u⋆v = 0}

as the model for BP d. Its elements are unordered pairs of orthogonal lines in
K∞, so Γ may be interpreted as a subspace of SP 2(KP ∞). The corresponding
models for B(Sd−1×Sd−1) and BF d are V2/(Sd−1×Sd−1) and V2/F d respectively.

Remarks 2.13. Applying [22, Lemma 1.7] conﬁrms that the universal Pin ‡(d)
structure on θ corresponds to a speciﬁc Spin ‡(d + 1) structure on det(θ) ⊕ θ.
The latter is given by the canonical isomorphism
2(χ) ∼= det(θ) ⊕ θ
p∗

(2.14)

associated to the splitting (2.7) of (2.6). Since the bundle of Corollary 2.10(2)
arises from the bundle (1) by factoring out the action of τ , the double covering
(4) is also the S0-bundle of the tautological real line bundle λ over RP (χ).
Hence (2.14) coincides with the standard splitting of p∗

2(χ) as λ ⊕ λ⊥.

SYMMETRIC SQUARES OF PROJECTIVE SPACE

In the quaternionic case, Pin−(4) and Pin+(4) are isomorphic by [4, §5.3].
So θ must not be confused with the universal Pin+(4) bundle over the same
base, which arises from modifying (2.7) by τ · k = −¯k, given any k in H [5].

The universal Pin ‡(d) unit disc bundle may be displayed as the diagram

(2.15)

S(θ)

⊂

−−→ D(θ)

⊃←−−−−−−→s

Γ,

where s is the projection and the zero-section its left inverse. By (2.7) this is
homeomorphic to the diagram

(2.16)

V2 ×P d Sd−1 ⊂−−→ V2 ×P d Dd

where P d acts on Dd ⊂ K by τ · q = ¯q and (cid:0) a 0

therefore identiﬁes S(θ) as a model for BF d.

V2/P d,

⊃←−−−−−−→s
0 b(cid:1) · q = aq¯b. Proposition 2.8(3)

The open disc bundle associated to θ has total space Do(θ) = V2 ×P d Dd

o , and

ﬁbre the open unit d-disc Dd
o .

Deﬁnitions 2.17. For any n ≥ 1, the smooth manifold Γn ⊂ Γ is the orbit
space Vn+1,2/P d, of dimension (2n − 1)d. Its elements are unordered pairs of
orthogonal lines in Kn+1, so Γn may be interpreted as a subspace of SP 2(KP n);
it also admits the Pin ‡(d) bundle θn, which is the restriction of θ.

By construction, the inclusion Γ ⊂ SP 2(KP ∞) is the colimit of the inclusions

Γn ⊂ SP 2(KP n), and (2.15) is the colimit of the disc bundle diagrams

(2.18)

S(θn) ⊂−−→ D(θn)

⊃←−−−−−−→sn

Γn .

Similarly, Do(θ) is the colimit of the total spaces Do(θn).

3. Orthogonalisation and cofibre sequences

Inspiration for this section is provided by [19], where the coﬁbre sequence

(3.1)

Sn i∆−−→ SP 2(Sn)

b∆−−→ Th(λ⊥

n ) −−→ . . .

is introduced; i∆ denotes the inclusion of the diagonal Sn, and Th(λ⊥
n ) is the
Thom space of the complement of the tautological line bundle λn over RP n, for
n ≥ 1. An analogue of (3.1) is developed for SP 2(KP n), and Th(θn) is identiﬁed
with the 1-point compactiﬁcation of the conﬁguration space C2(KP n).

Henceforth, it is convenient to denote SP 2(KP n) by SP 2

n . As above, KP n is
taken to be the quotient space S(n+1)d−1/Sd−1 of the unit sphere; so for any [y],
[z] in KP n, the real number |y⋆z| is well-deﬁned, and determines a continuous
function ǫ : SP 2
n → [0, 1]. By deﬁnition, ǫ takes value 1 on the diagonal KP n,
and 0 on the subspace Γn of Deﬁnition 2.17. The quantity (1 − |y⋆z|2)1/2 is
known as the chordal distance from [y] to [z] in KP n.

Following §1, the diagonal ∆n = KP n ⊂ SP 2

n has an open neighbourhood
associated to the tangent bundle τKP n. Its ﬁbre is the open cone on RP nd−1,
and it may be identiﬁed with ǫ−1(0, 1]. Our immediate aim is to ﬁnd a similar
link between ǫ−1[0, 1) and θn, for which a brief diversion is required.

Deﬁnitions 3.2. For any h in K with |h| < 1, the positive real number R and
the positive deﬁnite Hermitian matrix Mh are given by

R : = (1 + |h|)1/2 + (1 − |h|)1/2

and

h

Mh : = (cid:18)R2/2
R2/2(cid:19)R−1.
−¯h R2/2(cid:19)R−1(cid:0)1 − |h|2(cid:1)−1/2.

So R2 + 4R−2|h|2 = 4 and (1 − |h|2)1/2 = 1 − 2R−2|h|2, whence

(3.3)

h =(cid:18)1 h

¯h 1(cid:19) and M −1

h =(cid:18)R2/2 −h

M 2

The matrix (uh vh) : = (u v)Mh lies in the non-compact Stiefel manifold

Wn+1,2 : = {(w x) : kwk = kxk = 1, |w⋆x| < 1}

of normalised 2-frames over K, because u⋆

hvh = h for any (u v) in Vn+1,2.

The right action of P d on the subspace Vn+1,2 extends to Wn+1,2 by

(3.4)

(w x) · τ = (x w)

and

(w x) ·(cid:18)a 0

0 b(cid:19) = (wa xb),

and the orbit space Wn+1,2/P d may be identiﬁed with the subspace SP 2
of SP 2

n . As such, it is an open neighbourhood of Γn.

n \ ∆n

Theorem 3.5. For any n ≥ 1 (including ∞), there is a homeomorphism

m : (Do(θn), Γn) −→ (SP 2

n \ ∆n , Γn)

of pairs, which induces a deformation retraction of SP 2

n \ ∆n onto Γn.

Proof. The formula m′((w x), h) : = (wh xh) deﬁnes a function
(3.6)

m′ : Vn+1,2 × Dd

o −→ Wn+1,2,

which is continuous because Mh varies continuously with h. The equations

Mh τ = τ M¯h

and

Mh(cid:18)a 0

0 b(cid:19) = (cid:18)a 0

0 b(cid:19) M¯ahb

o and (3.4) on Wn+1,2. Moreover, m′′(w x) : = ((w x)M −1

hold for all a, b in Sd−1, so m′ is equivariant with respect to the free P d-actions of
(2.16) on Vn+1,2×Dd
k ; k)
deﬁnes an equivariant inverse, where k : = w⋆x satisﬁes |k| < 1. So m′ induces
n \ ∆n of P d-orbit spaces. It also acts as
a homeomorphism m : Do(θn) → SP 2
the identity on the subspace of elements ((w x), 0), which descends to the zero
section Γn of Do(θn).

Since |u⋆

hvh| = t if and only if |h| = t, the required retraction is deﬁned by
lt : = m ◦ t ◦ m−1, where t denotes ﬁbrewise multiplication by t in Do(θn) for
0 ≤ t ≤ 1; in particular, l0 = sn.

For both statements, the case n = ∞ is obtained by taking colimits.

(cid:3)

Remark 3.7. The homeomorphism m′′ illustrates L¨owdin’s symmetric orthog-
onalisation procedure [23], which originally arose in the literature of quantum
chemistry, albeit over C. There seem to be no explicit references over H, but
the proof remains valid because quaternionic matrices have polar forms [39].
For any normalised 2-frame (w x), where w⋆x = k and |k| < 1, the 2-frame

(3.8)

(wk xk) : = (w x)M −1

SYMMETRIC SQUARES OF PROJECTIVE SPACE

is orthonormal, and its construction is invariant with respect to interchanging
vectors in each frame. L¨owdin’s procedure works because Mk is the unique
positive deﬁnite square root of (w x)⋆(w x), as conﬁrmed by (3.3).

Corollary 3.9. For any n ≥ 1, the conﬁguration space C2(KP n) is homeomor-
phic to Do(θn), and homotopy equivalent to Γn.
(cid:3)

Since the quotient space SP 2

n /∆n is homeomorphic to the one-point com-
pactiﬁcation of C2(KP n), Corollary 3.9 shows that both may be identiﬁed with
the Thom space Th(θn), for any n ≥ 1.

Now recall the canonical projection π : Bn → SP 2

n of (1.5), where Bn denotes
the Borel construction S∞ ×C2 (KP n × KP n). Following (1.6), its restriction

to the diagonal b∆n is the projection π2 : RP ∞ × KP n → KP n onto the second

factor. For convenience, RP ∞ × KP n will usually be abbreviated to RK n.

Proposition 3.10. For every n ≥ 1, the map π induces a commutative ladder

Proof. Both in and i∆ are CW inclusions, and π is an oﬀ-diagonal homotopy
equivalence, as noted in (1.6). It therefore induces a map

where MP d denotes the Thom space of the Pin ‡(d) bundle θ (more commonly
written as MP in‡(d)). Ladder 3.14 also commutes, and its rows are coﬁbre
sequences; it is the primary input for the cohomology calculations of the re-
maining sections. If so preferred, the crucial properties of 3.12 may be deduced
directly from Bredon’s results [8, Chapter VII], using ˇCech cohomology.

where MP d is homeomorphic to the mapping cone of p3, and j denotes the

because there are homotopy equivalences h1 and h2 for which the square

arguments with h2 lead to a homotopy equivalence between ﬁbrations

p4−→ BP d −→ RP ∞ and KP ∞ × KP ∞ k−→ B −→ RP ∞ ;

the former is the Borel bundle (1.4) and the latter arises by classifying (2.10)(4).

4. Characteristic classes

In this section, characteristic classes are determined for various of the vector
bundles introduced above. The results are expressed in the notation of §2, and
play an important part in the ﬁnal calculations.

The integral cohomology rings

(4.1)

H ∗(BOK(1)) ∼= Z[z]

and

H ∗(BOK(2)) ∼= Z[l1, l2]

are standard, as are the properties of their generators.
In particular, z has
dimension d, and is the 1st Chern class c1(ζ) or the 1st symplectic Pontryagin
class p1(ξ); similarly, l1 and l2 have dimensions d and 2d, and are the 1st and
2nd Chern classes of ζ2 or the 1st and 2nd symplectic Pontryagin classes of
ξ2 respectively. Tensoring with Z/2 yields the corresponding rings with mod
2 coeﬃcients, so z, l1 and l2 may be confused with their mod 2 reductions by
allowing the context to distinguish between them. With this convention, the
non-zero Stiefel-Whitney classes of the stated bundles are given by

(4.2)

wd(ω) = z, wd(ω2) = l1, w2d(ω2) = l2

and wd(χ) = l1

in H ∗(BOK(1); Z/2) and H ∗(BOK(2); Z/2) respectively.

Our calculations also involve RP ∞, which admits the tautological real line

bundle η. Its integral and mod 2 cohomology rings are given by

(4.3)

H ∗(RP ∞) ∼= Z[c]/(2c)

and

H ∗(RP ∞; Z/2) ∼= Z/2[a],

where c = c1(ηC) has dimension 2 and a = w1(η) has dimension 1.
In this
case, reduction mod 2 satisﬁes ρ(c) = a2. Because H ∗(KP ∞) is torsion free,
it follows from the K¨unneth formula that the integral and mod 2 cohomology
rings of RK∞ are given by
(4.4) H ∗(RK∞) ∼= Z[c, z]/(2c)

H ∗(RK∞; Z/2) ∼= Z/2[a, z],

and

where a, c, and z are pullbacks of their namesakes along the projections.

The cohomology rings of KP n, Grn+1,2, RP n, and RP ∞× KP n are obtained

from (4.1), (4.3), and (4.4) by appropriate truncation.

The quotient epimorphism P d → C2 of Proposition 2.8(4) may be identiﬁed
with det, because τ acts on Rd with determinant (−1)d−1 = −1 by (2.7). So
Remarks 2.13 conﬁrm that the line bundle λ is classiﬁed by the induced map

(4.5)

B det : BP d −→ RP ∞,

in particular, w1(λ) is given by λ∗(a) in
which will also be denoted by λ;
H 1(BP d; Z/2), and c1(λC) by λ∗(c) in H 2(BP d). By deﬁnition, λ restricts to
the tautological line bundle η over the ﬁbre RP d of Proposition 2.10(2), so
2(w1(λ)) = a in H 1(RP d; Z/2) and i∗
2(c1(λC)) = c in H 2(RP d). Henceforth,
i∗
w1(λ) and c1(λC) are written as a and c respectively.

Remark 4.6. The epimorphism det restricts to the identity on the subgroup
C2 < P d, so H ∗(RP ∞; R) is a summand of H ∗(BP d; R) for coeﬃcients R = Z
or Z/2. All powers of the elements a and c are therefore non-zero.

Now consider the pull back of ω2 along the projection p2 : BP d → BOK(2)
2(l2).

of Theorem 2.10(2), and its characteristic classes x : = p∗
Equating the total Stiefel-Whitney classes of (2.14) gives

2(l1) and y : = p∗

(4.7)

1 + x = (1 + a) w(θ).

in H ∗(BP d; Z/2). Since wi(θ) = 0 for i > d, it follows that

(4.8)

w(θ) = 1 + a + · · · + ad + x,

and hence that ad+j = ajx in H d+j(BP d; Z/2) for every j ≥ 1.

Remarks 4.9. These formulae highlight the importance of the integral coho-
mology class m: =cd/2 +x, whose mod 2 reduction ad +x may also be written as
m. Then equation (4.8) conﬁrms that w2(θ) = m is the reduction of an integral
class when d = 2, and that w2(θ) = w2
1(θ) (because both are equal to a2) when
d = 4. These are the deﬁning properties for Pin ‡(d)-bundles [16, §2].

The map p2 imposes an H ∗(BOK(2); R)-algebra structure on H ∗(BP d; R).
For R = Z/2, the Leray-Hirsch theorem proves that p∗
2 injects Z/2[l1, l2] as a
direct summand [17], and that H ∗(BP d; Z/2) has basis 1, a, . . . , ad thereover.
Combined with (4.7), this identiﬁes H ∗(BP d; Z/2) as the Z/2 algebra

(4.10)

G∗ : = Z/2[a, m, y]/(am).

The integral characteristic classes of Pin ‡(d)-bundles are equally important.

Theorem 4.11. The integral cohomology ring H ∗(BP d

+) is isomorphic to

Z ∗ : = Z[c, m, y]/(2c, cm).

Proof. Consider the Leray-Serre spectral sequence

Ep,q
2

: = H p(BOK(2)+; H q(RP d

+)) =⇒ H p+q(BP d
+)

of the ﬁbration p2, noting that BOK(2) is simply-connected. Since H ∗(BOK(2))
is free abelian and even dimensional, there are isomorphisms
∼= H ∗(BOK(2)+) ⊗ H ∗(RP d

+);

E∗,∗
∞

∼= E∗,∗

12

thus p∗
of E∗,∗
E∗,∗

2 is monic, and i∗
∞ is represented by xiyjck in H ∗(BP d

2(c) = c in H 2(RP d

+). So any additive generator xiyj ⊗ck
+), and there is an isomorphism

+) of H ∗(BOK(2)+)+-modules, on generators 1, c, . . . , cd/2.

∞ ∼= H ∗(BP d
The multiplicative structure is described by the single relation cd/2+1 = cx,
(cid:3)

or cm = 0, which follows from Remark 4.6 and the fact that cx 6= 0.

Since ρ(cm) = a2m in H d+2(BP d; Z/2), the integral and mod 2 relations are

compatible.

Remarks 4.12. The homotopy commutative square (3.16) may be used to
transport the cohomology classes c, z, and a to H ∗(BF d), and c, a, x and y to
H ∗(B) (surpressing h∗
2 from the notation). The homotopy equivalence of
(3.17) ensures that x and y are then characterised by the fact that they satisfy

1 and h∗

k∗(x) = z1 + z2

and k∗(y) = z1z2

in H ∗(KP ∞ × KP ∞), and are pullbacks from H ∗(BOK(2)). These conventions
lead to isomorphisms H ∗(BF d

+) ∼= Z[c, z]/(2c) and H ∗(B+) ∼= Z ∗.

Similarly, bundles η and ω are deﬁned over BF d as pullbacks from RK∞.

Now recall Theorem 2.10 and consider the bundle

OK(2)/F d −→ BF d p5−→ BOK(2),

(4.13)
whose projection factorises as p5 = p2 ◦p3. The pullback γ : =p∗
5(ω2) is a complex
or quaternionic 2-plane bundle, and is induced by a representation of F d on K2,
given by Deﬁnitions 2.4. In terms of the basis {(1, ±1)t}, the representation is
equivalent to a sum α ⊕ β of 1-dimensionals, where

α(τ, a) = · a

and

β(τ, a) = · (−a)

respectively, for any a in Sd−1. In other words, there is an isomorphism

(4.14)

γ ∼= ω ⊕ (η ⊗R ω).

Lemma 4.15. The characteristic classes of γ are given by l1(γ) = cd/2 + 2z
and l2(γ) = (cd/2 + z)z in H ∗(BF d), and wd(γ) = ad and w2d(γ) = (ad + z)z
in H ∗(BF d; Z/2).

Proof. By (4.14), the total Chern or symplectic Pontryagin class is given by

(4.16)

l(γ) = (1 + z)(1 + cd/2 + z) = 1 + cd/2 + 2z + cd/2z + z2.

This makes l1 and l2 explicit, and determines wd and w2d by applying ρ.

(cid:3)

Also, consider the real line bundle p∗

3(λ) over BF d. By analogy with Remark
4.6, the composition C2 < F d < P d is the standard inclusion; so there is an
isomorphism p∗

3(λ) ∼= η, whence

(4.17)
in H 1(BF d; Z/2) and H 2(BF d) respectively.

3(λ)) = a and c1(p∗

w1(p∗

3(λC)) = c

Lemma 4.18. The homomorphism p∗

3 : Z ∗ → Z[c, z]/(2c) is determined by

p∗
3(m) = 2z,

3(y) = (cd/2 + z)z,
p∗

and

p∗
3(c) = c.

Proof. It suﬃces to combine Lemma 4.15 with (4.17).

(cid:3)

SYMMETRIC SQUARES OF PROJECTIVE SPACE

13

Over Z/2, the formulae become p∗
3(a) = a.
Finally, observe that the diagonal subgroup C2 < C2 × Sd−1 induces a map
e : BC2 → BF d. So there are isomorphisms e∗(ω) ∼= ηK and e∗(η) ∼= η of
pullback bundles, from which the equations

3(y) = (ad + z)z and p∗

3(m) = 0, p∗

e∗(z) = l1(ηK) = cd/2

(4.19)
hold in Z[c]/(2c); in other words, e∗ is evaluation at z = cd/2. Over Z/2, the
formulae become e∗(z) = ad and e∗(a) = a, giving evaluation at z = ad.

and e∗(c) = c1(ηC) = c

5. Mod 2 cohomology

In this section, the homotopy commutative ladder (3.14) is exploited to com-
pute the cohomology ring H ∗(SP 2; Z/2) in terms of H ∗(B; Z/2) and the Thom
isomorphism. Some of the results are speciﬁc cases of those of Nakaoka [30].

In order to facilitate the calculations, it is convenient to identify the upper

coﬁbre sequence with (3.15), and use Remarks 4.12. The long exact sequence

. . .

δ←− H ∗(RK∞; Z/2) i∗

δ←− . . .
becomes the Gysin sequence for the bundle θ, and may be rewritten as

b∗
←− H ∗(MP d; Z/2)

←− H ∗(B; Z/2)

δ

p∗
3←− G∗ ·m

←− B∗−d

δ

. . .

←− Z/2[a, z]

(5.1)
where .m denotes multiplication by the Euler class m = wd(θ). The Thom
isomorphism identiﬁes H ∗(MP d; Z/2) with the free G∗-module G∗hti on a single
d-dimensional generator t, which is otherwise known as the Thom class and
satisﬁes b∗(t) = m. The multiplicative structure of H ∗(MP d; Z/2) is determined
by the relation t2 = mt, and may be encoded as an isomorphism

←− . . . ,

H ∗(MP d; Z/2) ∼= tG∗[t]/(t2 + mt)

(5.2)
of algebras over Z/2, where tG∗[t] represents the ideal (t) ⊂ G∗[t]. The impli-
cation that p∗

3(m) = 0 is conﬁrmed by the mod 2 version of Lemma 4.18.

So the key to further calculation is held by δ, and its values on zk for k > 0.

For notational simplicity, it is convenient to let R = Z or Z/2, and write

(5.3)
in H kd+1(MP d; R). The Thom isomorphism is deﬁned by relative cup product,
and the following basic property [11, (8.13)] is required.
Lemma 5.4. For any u in H ∗(BP d; R) and v in H ∗(BF d; R), the equation

δk : = δ(zk)

δ(p∗

3(u)v) = uδ(v)

holds in H ∗(MP d; R).

(cid:3)

Lemma 4.18 and (5.2) then imply that δ(aj zk) = ajδk for any j ≥ 0 and

k ≥ 1, and that the second order recurrence relation

(5.5)
holds in H ∗(MP d; Z/2). So δ is completely determined by (5.5).

δk+2 = adδk+1 + yδk with δ0 = 0, δ1 = at.

With the stated initial conditions, (5.5) may be solved explicitly by standard
techniques. However, the following brief diversion interprets the solution in a
more general framework, which is applicable in later sections.

14

YUMI BOOTE AND NIGEL RAY

Deﬁnition 5.6. Over any commutative ring Q, the generalised Fibonacci poly-
nomials qk(x1, x2) [2] lie in Q[x1, x2], and are speciﬁed by the recurrence relation

qk+2 = x1qk+1 + x2qk with q0 = 0, q1 = 1 ;

if x2 = 1, they reduce to the Fibonacci polynomials [18].

Diﬀerent choices of q0 and q1 create new sequences of polynomials, which
may also be written as sums of monomials by adapting the methods of [2, §2].
This applies to (5.5) with Q = H ∗(MP d; Z/2), and leads to the following.

Proposition 5.7. For any k > 0, the equation

(5.8)

δk = X0≤i≤(k−1)/2

holds in H kd+1(MP d; Z/2).

(cid:18)k − 1 − i

i

(cid:19)a(k−1−2i)d+1yit

(cid:3)

The binomial coeﬃcients need only, of course, be evaluated mod 2; so, for
example, δ2 = ad+1 t and δ3 = a2d+1 t + ayt, in dimensions 2d + 1 and 3d + 1
respectively. Equation (5.8) may also be read oﬀ from [14, p252].

Remarks 5.9. An immediate consequences of Proposition 5.7 is that

δk ≡ a(k−1)d+1 t mod (y)

for all k > 0, and therefore that δk is non-zero. Generalisations require the fact

[36, Lemma 2.6] that (cid:0)a

b(cid:1) is odd precisely when the 1s in the dyadic expansion

of b form a subset of the 1s in the dyadic expansion of a; for example,

δ2n = a(2n−1)d+1 t

and δ2n+1 =

n−1Xi=0

a(2n−2i+1)d+1y2i

t,

for every n ≥ 0.

These results may be used to understand the long exact cohomology sequence

of the lower coﬁber sequence of (3.14), for which the commutative square

H ∗(MP d; Z/2)

←−−−− H ∗−1(RK∞; Z/2)

idx

δ

δ

2

xπ∗

H ∗(MP d; Z/2)
is crucial. The composition δ ◦ π∗
2 : Z/2[z] → Z/2[a, z] is
the natural inclusion and δk is never 0. The lower δ is therefore also monic, and
Nakaoka’s short exact sequence [30, p 668]

2 is monic, because π∗

←−−−− H ∗−1(KP ∞; Z/2)

b∗
∆←− H ∗(MP d; Z/2)

δ

←− H ∗−1(KP ∞; Z/2) ←− 0

emerges immediately. Of course, (5.10) splits as vector spaces over Z/2.

Theorem 5.11. There is an isomorphism

H ∗(SP 2; Z/2) ∼= tG∗[t]/(t2 + mt, δk : k > 0),

where t and m have dimension d, and δk has dimension kd + 1.

SYMMETRIC SQUARES OF PROJECTIVE SPACE

15

Proof. It follows from (5.10) that there is an isomorphism

(5.12)

H ∗(SP 2; Z/2) ∼= H ∗(MP d; Z/2)/δ(H ∗−1(KP ∞; Z/2))

of rings, and suﬃces to note that H ∗(KP ∞; Z/2) is generated by the zk.

(cid:3)

Remarks 5.13. Theorem 5.11 proves that only monomials of the form miyj t
multiply non-trivially in H ∗(SP 2; Z/2), subject to the relation t2 = mt. So
δk t = 0 for all k, and the ideal (δk) reduces to the summand Zhδki.

The isomorphism of Theorem 5.11 may be clariﬁed by importing the values
of δk from Proposition 5.7. Since δ3 = 0, for example, a5 t = ayt in the complex
case and a9t = ayt in the quaternionic case, in dimensions 7 and 13 respectively.

6. Integral cohomology

In this section, the commutative ladder (3.14) is exploited to compute the
integral cohomology rings H ∗(MP d) and H ∗(SP 2). Input is provided by the
geometric and mod 2 cohomology results of §§3, 4, and 5. As in earlier sec-
tions, integral cohomology classes and their mod 2 reductions may be written
identically when the context is suﬃcient to distinguish between them.

Following the mod 2 case, it is convenient to begin with the upper long exact

sequence of the cohomology ladder, which takes the form

(6.1)

. . .

δ←− H ∗(RK∞)

i∗
←− H ∗(B)

b∗
←− H ∗(MP d)

δ←− . . . .

The bundle θ is non-orientable, because w1(θ) = a by (4.8); so it has no integral
Euler class, and (5.1) cannot be reinterpreted over Z. Nevertheless, almost all
the required information can be deduced directly from (6.1), by separating the
cohomology groups into even and odd dimensional summands.

By Theorem 4.11 and Remarks (4.12), H od(B) and H od(RK∞) are zero. So
(6.1) reduces to a collection of exact sequences of length 4, which together imply
that b∗ and δ induce isomorphisms

(6.2)

H ev(MP d) ∼= Ker i∗

and

H od(MP d) ∼= Cok i∗

respectively. The relative cup product invests H ∗(MP d) with a natural module
structure over Z ∗, and the ﬁrst isomorphism is of Z ∗-algebras; it interacts with
δ as in Lemma 5.4. The second isomorphism is of graded abelian groups, and
shifts dimension by 1.

Lemma 6.3. The kernel of i∗ is the principal ideal (m2 − 4y) in Z ∗.

Proof. Lemma 4.18 implies that i∗(m2 − 4y) = 0, so (m2 − 4y) ⊆ Ker i∗.

On the other hand, let f (m, y) + g(c, y) denote an arbitrary element

nXi=0

fi m2(n−i)yi +

n−1Xj=0

gj c(n−j)dyj

of Z 2nd, and suppose that it is annihilated by i∗; then

(6.4)

f (2z, (cd/2 + z)z) + g(c, (cd/2 + z)z) = 0

16

YUMI BOOTE AND NIGEL RAY

in Z[c, z]/(2c). Equating coeﬃcients of cnd, c(n−1/2)dz, . . . , c(n−(n−1)/2)dzn−1
shows that g0, g1, . . . , gn−1 ≡ 0 mod 2, and hence that g(c, y) = 0. Equating

i=0 2ifi = 0, and hence that

coeﬃcients of z2n shows that f + : =Pn

f (m, y)|m2=4y = f +y2n = 0.

Thus m2 − 4y divides f (m, y). Similar arguments apply to elements of Z 2(nd+q)
for 1 ≤ q < d, and conﬁrm that Ker i∗ ⊆ (m2 − 4y) in Z ∗.
(cid:3)

Remark 6.5. To describe the image of i∗, it therefore suﬃces to work modulo
(m2 − 4y); moreover, every element of the ideal takes the form f (m, y)(m2 − 4y)
for some polynomial f in Z[m, y], because c(m2 − 4y) = 0 in Z 2d+2.

Lemma 6.6. The cokernel of i∗ is isomorphic to the Z/2-module on basis ele-
ments cizj for 0 ≤ i < jd/2.

Proof. With the notation of Lemma 6.3, consider the possibility that

f (2z, (cd/2 + z)z) + g(c, (cd/2 + z)z) = c(n−k/2)dzk

(6.7)
for some 0 < k ≤ 2n. Evaluating at z = cd/2 (or applying e∗, as in (4.19)) gives
g0 ≡ 1 mod 2, whereas evaluating at z = 0 gives g0 ≡ 0. This contradiction
conﬁrms that c(n−k/2)dzk lies in the image of i∗ if and only if k = 0.

However, i∗(2lk

2 ) = 2z2k+1 for any k ≥ 0. It follows that
every element of the cokernel has order 2, and that it is spanned by the cizj for
i ≥ 0 and j > 0. There are relations amongst these elements, because

2 ) = 2z2k and i∗(mlk

(6.8)
in Cok i∗, and (6.8) may be multiplied by any ci. The resulting expression

2) = (cd/2 + z)jzj = 0

i∗(lj

(6.9)

cjd/2zj = X0<i≤j

(cid:18)j
i(cid:19)c(j−i)d/2zj+i

describes cjd/2zj as a unique homogeneous linear combination of monomials
cazb for which 0 ≤ a < bd/2. By iteration, a similar description arises for any
ckzj; the iteration terminates, because every step reduces the powers of c that
occur. So the stated monomials form a basis over Z/2.
(cid:3)

To illustrate the iteration, note that (6.9) gives c3d/2z3 = cdz4 + cd/2z5 + z6

for j = 3; so c5d/2z3 = c2dz4 + c3d/2z5 + cdz6. Importing c2dz4 = z8 yields

which is of the required format.

c5d/2z3 = c3d/2z5 + cdz6 + z8,

Remark 6.10. Lemma 6.6 shows that the coeﬃcient homomorphism 2 : Z → Z
induces the zero homomorphism on H od(MP d), and the associated long exact
cohomology sequence proves that mod 2 reduction is monic.

The relations 6.8 also imply that every even power z2k may be expressed
as a homogeneous linear combination of lower powers, and therefore lower odd
powers, by iteration. Such an expression may be found by rewriting z2k as uk,
and considering the recurrence relation

(6.11)

uk+2 = cd uk+1 + (cd/2 + z)2z2uk with u0 = 0, u1 = cd/2z.

SYMMETRIC SQUARES OF PROJECTIVE SPACE

17

Then (6.11) ﬁts into the framework of Deﬁnition 5.6, which gives

(6.12)

uk = X0≤i<k

(cid:18)k
i(cid:19)c(k−i−1/2)dz2i+1

for k > 0. For example, if k = 3, then z6 = cd/2z5 + c3d/2z3 + c5d/2z.

Theorem 6.13. As a Z ∗-module, H ∗(MP d) is generated by a 2d-dimensional
element s of inﬁnite order, and the jd + 1-dimensional elements δj of order 2,
for j ≥ 0. The module structure is determined by cs = mδj = 0,

cjd/2 δj = X0<i≤j

(cid:18)j
i(cid:19)c(j−i)d/2δj+i,

and

y δj = cd/2δj+1 + δj+2;

the algebra structure is determined by

(6.14)

s2 = (m2 − 4y)s

and

δiδj = sδi = 0,

for every i ≥ 0.

Proof. Deﬁne s by b∗(s) = m2 − 4y, and δk by (5.3). Then the abelian group
structure follows from Lemmas 6.3 and 6.6, and Remark 6.5. The relation
cs = 0 holds because b∗(cs) = c(m2 − 4y) = 0 by Theorem 4.11, and b∗ is
monic; similarly, mδj = δ(2zj+1) = 0 for any j, by Lemma 5.4. The formula
for cjd/2 δj is given by applying δ to (6.9), and the formula for y δj arises from

y δ(zj ) = δ((cd/2 + z)zj+1) = cd/2δ(zj+1) + δ(zj+2)

for any j > 0.

The relation s2 = (m2 − 4y)s holds because b∗ is monic, and δiδj = 0 because
H ev(MP d) is torsion free. Finally, the mod 2 reduction ρ(sδi) = ρ(s)δi is zero
by Remarks 5.13, so sδi = 0, by Remark 6.10.

Remarks 6.17. Since π∗
2 : Z[z] → Z[c, z]/(2c) is the canonical inclusion, The-
orem 6.13 shows that the lower δ acts by δ(zj ) = δj in H kd+1(MP d) for every
j > 0. Since 2δj = 0, the kernel of δ is the principal ideal (2z), and is additively
generated by 2zj in each dimension jd.

These observations lead to additive descriptions of H od(SP 2) and H ev(SP 2).

YUMI BOOTE AND NIGEL RAY

Proposition 6.18. There are isomorphisms

H od(SP 2) ∼= Z/2hui,j : 0 < i < jd/2i

of graded abelian groups, where ui,j has dimension 2i + jd + 1; in particular,
H od(SP 2) = 0 only in dimensions 1, 3, 5 if K = C, or 1, 3, 5, 9 if K = H.

Proof. Remarks 6.17 imply that b∗

∆(δj) = 0 in H jd+1(SP 2), and that

(6.19)

ui,j : = b∗

∆(ciδj)

is nonzero and has order 2 in H 2i+jd+1(SP 2), for every 0 < i < jd/2. By
Corollary 6.15, these elements exhaust the image of b∗
∆, which is epic in odd
dimensions because H od(KP ∞) is zero.
(cid:3)

Note that ujd/2,j =P0<i≤j(cid:0)j

i(cid:1)u(j−i)d/2,j+i in H 2jd+1(SP 2), for any j > 0.

Remark 6.20. Proposition 6.18 shows that mod 2 reduction is monic on
H od(SP 2), by analogy with Remark 6.10.

Remarks 6.17 conﬁrm the existence of elements np in H pd(SP 2) such that

∆(np) = 2zp, for every p > 0; they are well-deﬁned up to the image of b∗
i∗
∆.
Proposition 6.21. The graded abelian group H ev(SP 2) is torsion-free, and
admits a canonical choice of generator np in each dimension pd.

Proof. By Lemma 6.3, i∗ injects H ev(MP d) into H ev(B) as the ideal (s). It
∆ injects H ev(MP d) as a subring J ∗ of H ev(SP 2), and that π∗
follows that b∗
maps J ∗ isomorphically onto (s). So there is a split short exact sequence

(6.22)

0 ←−− Zh2zpi

b∗
∆←−− Zhmqlr

2si ←−− 0

for each p ≥ 1, where q and r range over q, r ≥ 0 and q + 2r + 2 = p. As p
varies, (6.22) conﬁrms that H ev(SP 2) is torsion free.

Since π∗ is a Z[1/2] isomorphism, it must be monic on H ev(SP 2).

In di-
mension 2kd, therefore, n2k may be speciﬁed uniquely by π∗(n2k) = 2yk in
H 2kd(BP d). For, if no such element exists, then π∗(n2k) − 2yk = α for some
nonzero α in (s); but π∗(α′) = α for some α′ in J 2kd, so π∗(m2k − α′) = 2yk, a
contradiction. The same argument works in dimension (2k−1)d, after replacing
2yk by myk−1. In either dimension np is an additive generator.
(cid:3)

Henceforth, np is assumed to be chosen in this way, for any p. The cases

(6.23)
in H d(SP 2) and H 2d(SP 2) are suﬃciently important to merit special notation.

Theorem 6.24. There is an isomorphism

H ∗(SP 2) ∼= Z[hp/2p−1, gqhr/2r, ui,j] / I,

where p, q ≥ 1, r ≥ 0 and 0 < i < jd/2, and I denotes the ideal

(2ui,j, ui,juk,l, ui,jhp/2p−1, ui,jgqhr/2r) ;

the classes g, h, and ui,j are those of (6.23) and (6.19) respectively.

SYMMETRIC SQUARES OF PROJECTIVE SPACE

19

Proof. Since π∗ embeds H ev(SP 2) in H ev(BP d; Z[1/2]), the canonical additive
generators g and h may be identiﬁed with their images m and 2y respectively;
similarly, the generators n2k−1 and n2k may be identiﬁed with myk−1 and 2yk,
and therefore with ghk−1/2k−1 and hk/2k−1. In particular, b∗

∆(s) = g2 − 2h.

From this viewpoint, the short exact sequence (6.22) prescribes additive bases
hk/2k−1, hk−1(g2 − 2h)/2k−1, . . . , g2k−2r−2hr(g2 − 2h)/2r, . . . , g2k−2(g2 − 2h)

in dimensions 2kd, and
ghk/2k, ghk−1(g2 − 2h)/2k−1, . . . , g2k−2r−1hr(g2 − 2h)/2r, . . . , g2k−1(g2 − 2h)

in dimensions (2k + 1)d, where 0 ≤ r < k. These are equivalent to bases

hk/2k−1, . . . , g2k−2rhr/2r, . . . , g2k

and ghk/2k, g2k−2r+1hr, . . . , g2k+1
respectively, which exhibit the stated multiplicative structure on H ev(SP 2).

For the families of products in I, note that ui,juk,l = 0 because ciδjckδl = 0
in H ∗(MP d), by Theorem 6.13. To evaluate the ﬁnal two products, consider
their reductions mod 2, and the fact that ρ(ui,j) = a2iδj in H 2i+jd+1(SP 2; Z/2).
So ρ(ui,jnp) lies in (δj ), and is therefore 0 by Remarks 5.13; so ui,jnp = 0 by
Remark 6.20, for any p > 0.
(cid:3)

7. Mod 2 truncation

In the ﬁnal two sections, it remains to describe how the cohomology rings of
Γn, Bn, and SP 2
n are obtained from the calculations above, using the restriction
homomorphisms induced by inclusion. All the resulting truncations are valid
for any n ≥ 1, although the case n = 1 is degenerate. For notational simplicity,
cohomology classes and their restrictions are written identically in both sections.

This section focuses mainly on mod 2 cohomology.
The ﬁrst space to consider is Γn. As described in Deﬁnition 2.17, it is the
total space RP (χn) of the projectivisation of the restriction to Grn+1,2 of the
universal Spin(d+1) bundle over BOK(2). By Corollary 3.9, it is also homotopy
equivalent to the conﬁguration space C2(KP n), whose one-point compactiﬁca-
tion is the Thom space Th(θn).

The cohomology ring of the Grassmannian is given by the truncation

H ∗((Grn+1,2)+; R) ∼= R[l1, l2]/(σn, σn+1)
of H ∗(BOK(2); R), where R = Z or Z/2 and the σk satisfy
(7.1)

σk+2 = −l1σk+1 − l2σk with σ0 = 1, σ1 = −l1.

Thus (7.1) ﬁts into the framework of Deﬁnition 5.6, and leads to

(7.2)

σk = X0≤i≤k/2

(−1)k−i(cid:18)k − i

in R[l1, l2], for k ≥ 1; this agrees, for example, with Yasui [38, (4.7)].

So the reasoning of (4.10) identiﬁes H ∗((Γn)+; Z/2) with the Z/2-algebra

(7.3)
where νk = σk(ad + m, y) in H kd(Γ ; Z/2), for k ≥ 1.

YUMI BOOTE AND NIGEL RAY

Theorem 8.1 conﬁrms the existence of an isomorphism
n[t]/(t2 + mt)

H ∗(Th(θn); Z/2) ∼= tG∗

(7.4)

of algebras over Z/2, by analogy with (5.2). The Thom class t is the pullback
of the universal example in H d(MP d; Z/2), and the associated Euler class is m.

Remark 7.5. Applying the restriction homomorphism to H ∗(MP d; Z/2) re-
quires care. Its kernel is the ideal (νn, νn+1)t, so (7.4) may be rewritten as

H ∗(Th(θn); Z/2) ∼= H ∗(MP d; Z/2)/(νn, νn+1)t

for any n ≥ 1. For example, ν3 = x3 in G3d
H 4d+2(Th(θ3); Z/2); however, a2x3t does not lie in the ideal (ν3 t).

2 , so a2x3t lies in (ν3)t and is 0 in

In order to complete the calculation of H ∗(SP 2

n ; Z/2), it suﬃces to apply

restriction to (5.10), and consider the resulting exact sequence

(7.6)

. . . ←− H ∗(SP 2

n ; Z/2)

b∗
∆←− H ∗(Th(θn); Z/2) δ←− H ∗−1(KP n; Z/2) ←− . . . .

Of course, Nakaoka’s results show that (7.6) is also short exact. In the current
context, this follows from the fact that restriction truncates H ∗(KP ∞; Z/2) and
H ∗(MP d; Z/2) by the ideals (zn+1) and (νn, νn+1)t respectively (the latter from
Remark 7.5). So restriction acts isomorphically on H ∗(MP d; Z/2) in dimensions
≤ nd + 3, and maps δk to its non-zero namesake in H kd+1(Th(θn); Z/2) for each
1 ≤ k ≤ n. Hence δ in (7.6) is monic, as required.

Theorem 7.7. For any n ≥ 1, there are isomorphisms

H ∗(SP 2

n ; Z/2) ∼= tG∗

n[t]/(t2 + mt, δk : 0 < k ≤ n)

∼= H ∗(SP 2; Z/2)/((νn, νn+1)t/(aνn t, aνn+1t))

of graded Z/2-algebras.

Proof. The ﬁrst isomorphism arises by adapting the proof of Theorem 5.11 to
the short exact sequence (7.6). In particular, the restriction map acts epimor-
phically on H ∗(SP 2; Z/2).

Comparing (5.8) with (7.2), and incorporating the relation ax = ad+1 from
(4.8), shows that δr+1 = aνr t in H (r+1)d+1(MP d; Z/2) for any r ≥ 1; so δn+1 and
δn+2 lie in (νn, νn+1)t. The recurrence relation (5.5) then shows that δn+s lies
in (νn, νn+1)t for any s ≥ 1. The kernel of the restriction map is therefore the
quotient (νn, νn+1)t/(aνn t, aνn+1 t), and the second isomorphism is veriﬁed. (cid:3)
For example, the classes ν2t = (a2d + m2 + y)t and ν3t = (a3d + m3)t are
nonzero in (ν2, ν3)t/(aν2 t, aν3 t). However, the simplest way to apply Theorem
7.7 is to use the ﬁrst isomorphism.

8. Integral truncation

Our ﬁnal section completes the calculations, by focusing on the integral coho-
mology rings of Γn, Bn, and SP 2
n . An important intermediate step is the study
of H ∗(Th(θn)), whose global structure is best described in the spirit of [9], using
local coeﬃcients. That viewpoint will, however, be presented elsewhere, and
attention will be restricted here to the applications.

SYMMETRIC SQUARES OF PROJECTIVE SPACE

21

As in the mod 2 case, the ﬁrst space to consider is the conﬁguration space
Γn ≃ C2(KP n), whose integral cohomology follows from the Leray-Serre spec-
tral sequence for the ﬁbration RP d → Γn → Grn+1,2, by restricting the coho-
mology of the base in the proof of Theorem 5.11.

Theorem 8.1. For any n ≥ 1, there is an isomorphism

H ∗((Γn)+) ∼= Z[c, m, y]/(2c, cm, νn, νn+1) ∼= H ∗(Γ+)/(νn, νn+1)

of graded rings, where νk = σk(cd/2 + m, y) in H kd(Γ ), for k ≥ 1.

The next task is to study H ∗(Th(θn)). The crucial geometric input is the
commutative diagram (3.11), whose upper row no longer arises from a 3-sphere
bundle for any ﬁnite n. Applying H ∗(−) gives the commutative ladder

of their namesakes in H ∗(B), following Remarks 4.12; thus H ∗(RK n) is the
truncation Z[c, z]/(2c, zn+1), and H od(RK n) = 0. To describe H ∗(Bn) in full
detail, a brief diversion is required.

For any k ≥ 0, consider the power sum polynomial

(8.3)

rk(e1, e2) = zk

1 + zk
2 ,

where e1 = z1 + z2 and e2 = z1z2. The rk lie in Z[e1, e2], and satisfy

(8.4)

rk+2 = e1 rk+1 − e2 rk with r0 = 2, r1 = e1.

They ﬁt into the framework of Deﬁnition 5.6, and are given by

The polynomials rk help to extend unpublished work of Roush [34] on H ∗(B).

Theorem 8.8. The integral cohomology ring H ∗((Bn)+) is isomorphic to
n : = Z[c, m, l2]/(2c, cm, rn+1, rn+2, yn+1) ∼= Z ∗/(rn+1, rn+2, yn+1)
Z ∗

where rk = rk(m, y) has dimension kd for every k ≥ 0.

of the Borel bundle for Bn, where H∗( ) denotes cohomology twisted by the

) by interchanging z1 and z2,
the ring of invariants is isomorphic to Z[e1, e2]/ Ker µ, where µ is the projection
of Z[e1, e2] into Z[z1, z2]/(zn+1

Every diﬀerential is zero for dimensional reasons, so (8.9) actually describes
the E∞ term. Furthermore, m and y in H ∗(Bn) represent e1 and e2 in E0,∗
∞
respectively, and c in H 2(Bn) represents c in E2,0
∞ . Thus cif (m, y) in H 2i+jd(Bn)
represents ci ⊗ f (e1, e2) in E2i,jd
∞ for any homogeneous polynomial f (m, y); all
extension problems are therefore trivial and (8.9) is additively isomorphic to
H ∗(Bn). Since cm represents c ⊗ e1 and both are zero, the isomorphism is also
multiplicative, and the result follows.

n is the principal ideal (m2 − 4y),
Proposition 8.14. For n ≥ 2, the kernel of i∗
and for n = 1, it is (2y); in dimensions > nd the monomials miyj and 2yk
form an additive basis, where n < i + 2j < 2(i + j) ≤ 2n and n < 2k ≤ 2n.

Proof. Truncation has no eﬀect in dimensions < nd, so Lemma 6.3 continues
to hold; furthermore, (8.13) conﬁrms that i∗
Now consider an element α that satisﬁes i∗

n(m2 − 4y) = 0 for any n ≥ 1.
n(α) = 0 in H (n+s)d(RK n), for some
s ≥ 1. Restriction is epic, so α lifts to α′ in H (n+s)d(B), where i∗(α′) = zn+1f
for some homogeneous polynomial f = f (c, z) in H (s−1)d(RK∞). The proof of
Lemma 6.3 extends to show that f must be of the form 2λzs−1, for some integer
λ. However, i∗(λrn+s) = 2λzn+s in H (n+s)d(RK∞), by (8.3). So α′ − λrn+s lies
in Ker i∗, and therefore in (m2 − 4y) by Lemma 6.3. Applying restriction then
conﬁrms that α lies in (m2 − 4y), as required; and this argument also works for
n = 1, because the relation r2 = m2 − 2y implies that m2 = 2y in H 2d(B1).

Remarks 8.15. Remarks (8.5) show that the power sum polynomials satisfy

H kd(SP 2) without ambiguity. In this context, (8.7) conﬁrms that every element

n ) by Remarks 8.15, so f3yn+1 lies in Im(π∗)
as well. Thus f3yn+1 ≡ 2ykd/2 or 0 mod (m) for even or odd k respectively, and
therefore lies in π∗(Rkd
n ),
and r lies in Rkd
(cid:3)

n ), by Remarks 8.15(2) and (3). So π∗(r) lies in π∗(Rkd

n ; hence J ev

n , as sought.

n ⊆ Rev

In fact (8.5) and Remarks 8.15 conspire to show that r2k ≡ hk/2k−1 mod (g)
and r2k+1 ≡ (−1)kghk/2k−1 mod (g2), for k ≥ 0. Corollary 8.10 conﬁrms that
H ∗(SP 2

n ) is Zhhn/2n−1i in dimension 2nd, and 0 in higher dimensions.
