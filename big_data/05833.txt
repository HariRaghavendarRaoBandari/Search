ABSTRACT

Context. This paper presents the results obtained with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) for the core of the lensing
cluster Abell 1689, as part of MUSE’s commissioning at the ESO Very Large Telescope.
Aims. Integral-ﬁeld observations with MUSE provide a unique view of the central 1 × 1 arcmin2 region at intermediate spectral
resolution in the visible domain, allowing us to conduct a complete census of both cluster galaxies and lensed background sources.
Methods. We performed a spectroscopic analysis of all sources found in the MUSE data cube. Two hundred and eighty-two objects
were systematically extracted from the cube based on a guided-and-manual approach. We also tested three diﬀerent tools for the
automated detection and extraction of line emitters. Cluster galaxies and lensed sources were identiﬁed based on their spectral features.
We investigated the multiple-image conﬁguration for all known sources in the ﬁeld.
Results. Previous to our survey, 28 diﬀerent lensed galaxies displaying 46 multiple images were known in the MUSE ﬁeld of view,
most of them were detected through photometric redshifts and lensing considerations. Of these, we spectroscopically conﬁrm 12
images based on their emission lines, corresponding to 7 diﬀerent lensed galaxies between z = 0.95 and 5.0. In addition, 14 new
galaxies have been spectroscopically identiﬁed in this area thanks to MUSE data, with redshifts ranging between 0.8 and 6.2. All
background sources detected within the MUSE ﬁeld of view correspond to multiple-imaged systems lensed by A1689. Seventeen
sources in total are found at z ≥ 3 based on their Lyman-α emission, with Lyman-α luminosities ranging between 40.5(cid:47)log(Lyα)(cid:47)42.5
after correction for magniﬁcation. This sample is particularly sensitive to the slope of the luminosity function toward the faintest end.
The density of sources obtained in this survey is consistent with a steep value of α ≤ −1.5, although this result still needs further
investigation.
Conclusions. These results illustrate the eﬃciency of MUSE in characterizing lensing clusters on one hand and in studying faint and
distant populations of galaxies on the other hand. In particular, our current survey of lensing clusters is expected to provide a unique
census of sources responsible for the reionization in a representative volume at z∼4-7.

1. Introduction

Clusters of galaxies are recognized to be the most eﬃcient grav-
itational lenses in the Universe (see, e.g., Kneib & Natarajan
2011, and the references therein). For almost 30 years since their
discovery, they have allowed the astrophysical community to de-
tect extremely faint and distant sources that would otherwise be
inaccessible. Strong magniﬁcation in the core of lensing clus-
ters has opened a brand-new type of observational approach to

characterize the most distant or faint sources while reducing the
selection bias in luminosity. Many high-redshift sources have
been identiﬁed and studied using this approach during the last
years (see, e.g., Zheng et al. 2012; Coe et al. 2013; Laporte et al.
2015; Atek et al. 2015). Cluster lenses have also contributed to
constrain the luminosity function for galaxies at high-z down
to the faintest limits, often through dedicated surveys (Bradley
et al. 2014; Ishigaki et al. 2015; Atek et al. 2015). Using lensing

clusters as eﬃcient gravitational telescopes requires a detailed
knowledge of the mass distribution, which in turn depends on
the correct identiﬁcation of multiply imaged systems in the clus-
ter core (Zitrin et al. 2011; Richard et al. 2014).

This paper presents the results obtained with the Multi Unit
Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE Bacon et al. 2010) of the core
of the lensing cluster Abell 1689 (hereafter A1689), as part of
MUSE’s commissioning at the ESO Very Large Telescope. This
cluster has been extensively studied during the past 20 years be-
cause it is one of the most eﬃcient strong-lensing clusters cur-
rently known. Previous analysis of A1689 discovered a large
number of multiple images. Coe et al. (2010, hereafter C10) used
135 images of 42 galaxies identiﬁed within the central ∼400 kpc
diameter region to constrain their mass model. One of the most
spectacular cases of a strong-lensing conﬁguration are the Sex-
tet Arcs, discovered in this cluster by Frye et al. (2007), and
produced by a z = 3.038 Lyman-break galaxy (LBG). The large
number of multiple images identiﬁed in this ﬁeld has allowed a
reliable mass reconstruction for this cluster, making it one of the
best-known gravitational telescopes (see, e.g., Limousin et al.
2007; Tu et al. 2008; Coe et al. 2010). For this reason, A1689
has become a privileged line of sight along which to study the
properties of faint and distant samples of background galaxies
(Alavi et al. 2014).
Integral-ﬁeld observations of A1689 with MUSE provide a
unique view of the central 1 × 1 arcmin2 region at intermedi-
ate spectral resolution in the visible domain, allowing us to con-
duct a complete census of both cluster galaxies and lensed back-
ground sources, in particular in the z ∼ 2.7 − 6.5 domain. Our
performance assessment of MUSE in the ﬁeld of A1689 con-
ﬁrms the idea that this instrument is particularly well suited for
the study of faint and distant populations of galaxies (see also
Richard et al. 2015; Bacon et al. 2015).

The outline of this article is as follows. In Sect. 2 we describe
the observations carried out on the ﬁeld of A1689 and provide
a summary of the data reduction and analysis process. Section
3 addresses the properties of the cluster galaxy populations as
seen by MUSE. The identiﬁcation of background sources lensed
by A1689 is discussed in Sect. 4, in particular the spectroscopic
conﬁrmation of known multiply imaged sources as well as the
discovery of new multiple systems. Implications of these results
on the mass modeling of A1689 are also discussed in this sec-
tion. Conclusions and perspectives are given in Sect. 5. Through-
out this paper, we adopt a Λ-CDM cosmology with ΩΛ = 0.7,
Ωm = 0.3 and H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1. Magnitudes are given in
the AB system (Oke & Gunn 1983). All quoted redshift mea-
surements are based on vacuum rest-frame wavelengths unless
otherwise speciﬁed.

2. From MUSE data to source extraction
2.1. Observations and data reduction
The core of A1689 (z = 0.1847, Teague et al. 1990) was tar-
geted with MUSE during its ﬁrst commissioning run on Febru-
ary 9, 2014 (ESO program 60.A-9100(A)). We observed a single
ﬁeld of view, centered on α=13:11:30.5, δ=-01:20:41.5 (J2000)
and oriented at PA=0◦, covering a ﬁeld of view of about 1 ×
1 arcmin2 (∼185×185 kpc at the redshift of the cluster). The
total exposure time was ∼1.83 hours, divided into six individ-
ual exposures of 1100 seconds of integration time with a small
linear dither pattern of 0.2(cid:48)(cid:48)and no rotation between each expo-
sure. Observations were obtained in the nominal WFM-NOAO-
N mode of MUSE, in good seeing conditions ranging between

Article number, page 2 of 12

∼0.51(cid:48)(cid:48)and 0.87(cid:48)(cid:48), as measured by the DIMM seeing monitor,
and between ∼0.9(cid:48)(cid:48)and 1.1(cid:48)(cid:48)(FWHM) as measured from MUSE
data cubes in the reconstructed white-light images.

MUSE data were reduced using the MUSE Data Reduction
System V1.0 (Weilbacher et al. 2012, 2014), including bias,
dark, ﬂat-ﬁelding, and geometrical corrections, basic sky sub-
traction, wavelength and ﬂux calibrations, and astrometry. The
six individual exposures were reduced and combined into a ﬁnal
datacube. Sky subtraction and correction for sky residuals were
performed with the ZAP software (Zurich Atmoshere Purge Soto
et al. 2016). Several versions of the MUSE datacube were per-
formed, with diﬀerent choices for the combination parameters
and the correction for sky residuals. Flux calibration and telluric
correction was achieved based on observations of the standard
star HD49798 (O6 star). The ﬁnal datacubes extend between
4750 and 9351Å, that is, 3681 spectral pixels with a scaling of
1.25Å/pixel and a spatial scale of 0.2(cid:48)(cid:48)/pixel. The spectral resolv-
ing power varies between ∼2000 in the blue and 4000 in the red.
The seeing measured on the combined exposure is ∼0.6(cid:48)(cid:48)FWHM
at 7300Å.

In addition to MUSE data, we used archive observations
obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) with ACS in
the optical bands (F475W, F625W, F775W, F850LP; PID 9289,
PI: H. Ford). These deep images reach a limiting magnitude of
AB∼28.2 in the F775W ﬁlter (5σ in a 0.2(cid:48)(cid:48)radius aperture) (see
also Alavi et al. 2014). Sources were extracted using two dif-
ferent approaches: a guided extraction based on the detection on
HST images, and a blind detection of line-emitters using dif-
ferent automated tools. A color image of the HST ﬁeld of view
showing the footprint of the MUSE ﬁeld is displayed in Fig. 1,
together with the lensed sources that are spectroscopically iden-
tiﬁed or conﬁrmed in this work.

2.2. Extraction of HST-detected sources

Sources were extracted using two diﬀerent approaches. First, a
catalog of objects was built with SExtractor package version 2.8
(Bertin & Arnouts 1996) based on the detection on the F775W
image. Two hundred forty-ﬁve objects were detected in this
way within the MUSE ﬁeld of view, with Kron-like magnitudes
(SExtractor MAG_AUTO) ranging between 17.0 and 28.1. Be-
fore extracting background sources in the central region from
the MUSE cube, background residuals and continuum emission
from bright cluster galaxies (hereafter BCGs) were ﬁtted and re-
moved from the MUSE cube with median ﬁltering in both wave-
length and spatial directions. The BCG area hereafter refers to
the central region, which is strongly contaminated by the bright
galaxies and displayed in a pink color-scale in Fig. 1. When
building the catalog, ten bright sources in the cluster core that
were missed by SExtractor because of severe crowding, were
manually added. In addition, 23 multiple images from Coe et al.
(2010) were missing from the SExtractor catalog for various rea-
sons, mainly because they are located within or close to the cen-
tral halo. They were also added to the catalog, as well as the four
line emitters that were serendipitously discovered after manual
inspection of the cube. This process provided 282 objects within
the MUSE ﬁeld of view. 1D spectra for all these sources were
systematically extracted from the MUSE cube using a ﬁxed aper-
ture corresponding to 1.5(cid:48)(cid:48)diameter.

Based on this guided-and-manual approach, a secure red-
shift could be determined for all sources up to MAG_AUTO
m(775W) ∼ 21.5, most of them being cluster galaxies or stars
identiﬁed based on their continuum emission. Redshifts were

D. Bina et al.: MUSE observations of the lensing cluster Abell 1689

ﬁrst measured based on manual inspection, followed by tem-
plate ﬁtting. In total, the spectroscopic sample obtained in this
way over the entire photometric catalog yields 63 cluster galax-
ies (49 of them with m(775W) < 21.5), 5 stars, and 24 galaxies
behind the cluster, 17 of them corresponding to sources at z ≥ 3
detected by their Lyman-α emission. The majority of these z ≥ 3
identiﬁcations were veriﬁed manually and by lensing (see be-
low).

2.3. Blind extraction of line emitters
The second approach was the automated (blind) detection and
extraction of line emitters and continuum based on three main
tools that are developed within the MUSE consortium, namely
CubExtractor, LSDCat, and MUSELET. CubExtractor (Can-
talupo in prep.) detects and extracts sources as connected voxels
(pixels in the cube) above a given pixel-to-pixel signal-to-noise
ratio (S/N) threshold, after 3D Gaussian ﬁltering of the MUSE
datacube. LSDCat (Herenz in prep.) is optimized for the extrac-
tion of compact narrow emission-line objects using a matched-
ﬁltering approach. MUSELET (for MUSE line-emission tracker,
Richard in prep.) is a simple SExtractor-based tool that extracts
sources displaying line-emission, regardless of whether they are
linked with continuum emission. All these tools have been op-
timized for the extraction of line emitters in diﬀerent environ-
ments. Using them in this crowded ﬁeld was particularly chal-
lenging.

A systematic manual inspection was needed to exclude spu-
rious detections, most of them coming from sky-line residu-
als or imperfect correction for cosmic rays (sometimes show-
ing extended structure in the ﬁnal cube). During this phase, we
used three diﬀerent versions of the MUSE datacube, with diﬀer-
ent choices in the parameters used for background subtraction,
sky-line residuals and cosmic-ray corrections. Reliable emission
lines are expected to be detected in all the cubes. The percent-
age of spurious detections depends on the ﬂux level of the lines
and the parameters used for the automated detection, typically
ranging from a few percent for the brightest sources to as high
as ∼75% for the faintest ones (e.g., ﬂux ∼5×10−18 erg/s/cm2).

These tools used in various combinations allowed us to de-
tect 14 new emission-line objects, most of them lacking a clear
counterpart in the HST/ACS images. All line emitters extracted
based on the guided-and-manual approach and discussed in the
previous section were detected by one of the automated tools.
All sources retained in Sect. 4 were found in all diﬀerent ver-
sions of the MUSE data cubes (with and without background
residuals and continuum emission subtracted). All of them yield
multiple-image conﬁgurations in good agreement with lensing
expectations. Based on our experience, the automated procedure
was especially useful to ﬁnd faint emission-line objects, with a
typical ﬂux of a few 10−18 erg/s/cm2, in particular those lacking
a clear detection on HST/ACS images.

3. Cluster galaxies
The spectroscopic sample obtained in the MUSE ﬁeld includes
63 cluster galaxies with secure redshifts. All of them exhibit
early-type spectra, excepted for two emission-line galaxies.
Forty-nine of them are bright, that is, have m(775W) < 21.5.
They constitute the majority of the sample within the spectro-
scopic completeness. Redshifts were measured based on the ﬁt
of several absorption lines with high S/N (Balmer series, MgI,
Gband, etc.). The mean and the median redshifts for this sample
are z = 0.1891 and 0.1889, respectively (z = 0.1883 and 0.1875

and F850LP HST/ACS images using a logarithmic scale. The footprint
of the MUSE ﬁeld is displayed together with the sources spectroscopi-
cally identiﬁed in this ﬁeld: cluster galaxies (red), stars (magenta), back-
ground galaxies at z ≤ 3 (cyan), and z ≥ 3 (yellow). Cluster galaxies
that were manually extracted are labeled CG. Objects labeled LN corre-
spond to either line emitters or multiple images lacking a counterpart in
the reference catalog based on the F775W image (see text for details).
North is up, east is left. A tentative spectroscopic redshift was also ob-
tained for the long southeast arcs in this ﬁeld, namely 8a and 8b in C10
(see discussion in Sect. 4.1). At the redshift of the cluster, the MUSE
ﬁeld is equivalent to ∼185×185 kpc.

when the sample is limited to the completeness level at m(775W)
≤ 21.5). When adopting the mean redshift for the whole sample
as the heliocentric reference, the velocity dispersion is found to
be σ = 2214 ± 38 km/s, in good agreement with previous ﬁnd-
ings in the literature that used more galaxies and wider regions
(typically a few Mpc) (see, e.g., Teague et al. 1990; Struble &
Rood 1991) This value also agrees well with the largest spectro-
scopic survey conducted so far on this cluster by Czoske (2004),
which included 525 cluster members and displayed a velocity
dispersion proﬁle decreasing from ∼2100 km/s in the center to
1200 km/s at ∼3h−1Mpc from the core. Figure 2 displays the ve-
locity distribution found in the MUSE ﬁeld of view with respect
to the centroid of the whole distribution, and the best Gaussian
ﬁt. The velocity dispersion does not depend on the sample and
the reference used (i.e., when the center of mass is computed
based on either the whole sample or the bright sample alone), all
σ values are the same within a ±0.5% interval.

However, Fig. 2 displays a more complex distribution than
the smooth Gaussian distribution found for this cluster on larger
scales. Czoske (2004), found no evidence for any substructure
at ∼1h−1Mpc scales, but a group of bright galaxies lies at ∼350
kpc northeast of the cluster center, therefore outside the MUSE
ﬁeld of view, but is still visible in the velocity distribution. This
group is typically interpreted as evidence for a non-relaxed state
in the cluster center that is possibly due to an ongoing merger
(Limousin et al. 2007). This close group skews the redshift dis-
tribution toward slightly higher redshifts (z ≥ 0.195) and broad-

tween z = 0.95 and 5.0. These systems are described in Sect. 4.1.
Fourteen new galaxies have also been spectroscopically identi-
ﬁed in this area thanks to MUSE data, with redshifts ranging
between 0.8 and 6.2, as presented in Sect. 4.2. The majority of
the lensed galaxies has been identiﬁed based on their Lyman-α
emission.

The lensing model used to analyze these data is the one pre-
sented in L07, based on Lenstool (Jullo et al. 2007), with some
reﬁnements to include the latest spectroscopic constraints on
multiple images available in the literature for this cluster (see
also Richard et al. in prep.). Table 1 provides the updated ver-
sion of Table 3 in L07, summarizing the main parameters used
throughout this paper for the lensing model. Dark matter halos
are modeled by a truncated pseudo-isothermal elliptical mass
distribution scaled to their masses, from large-scales (clumps 1
and 2, as discussed in Sect. 3) to cluster-galaxy halos. The main
contributions are listed in Table 1 together with the basic scal-
ing parameters used to model the contribution of 192 additional
early-type cluster galaxies. All images detected in this small ﬁeld
are expected to be multiply imaged systems lensed by A1689.
Our results below are fully consistent with this expectation, as
discussed in Sect. 4.3.

Table 2 presents the catalog of lensed images or sources
identiﬁed in this ﬁeld of view. Objects labeled LN in this ta-
ble (Col. 1) correspond either to line emitters or multiple im-
ages lacking a counterpart in the reference catalog based on the
F775W image. When the image or source was known before, its
previous identiﬁcation is given in Col. 2. Line ﬂuxes were mea-
sured after subtracting the underlying continuum. Line proﬁles
were ﬁtted using MPDAF tools (Piqueras et al., in preparation).
A double-Gaussian proﬁle was adopted to ﬁt Lyman-α lines,
combining two half Gaussian to better mimic the asymmetric
proﬁles. For Lyman-α emitters, we adopted the maximum of the
line as reference for redshift determinations. Figures 3 and 4 dis-
play the extracted spectra for all images after subtracting under-
lying continuum, grouped by lensing systems. Figure 5 displays
the distribution of emission-line ﬂuxes versus redshift measured
for the brightest emission lines (usually Lyman-α) versus red-
shift for the 21 galaxies found behind A1689. We note that mul-
tiply imaged sources are counted only once in this diagram, and
only the brightest line is shown for a given source. The median
lens-corrected ﬂux is ∼1.4×10−18 erg/s/cm2. This illustrates the
eﬀective depth achieved in this survey based on a relatively mod-
est amount of exposure time.

4.1. Results on previously known systems
Our MUSE survey has produced some interesting results on pre-
viously known systems in this ﬁeld, in particular those exhibiting
emission lines. We summarize these below.

– System 1 (619(1c) and L1f): One of the most spectacular
sources in this ﬁeld is the Sextet Arc, corresponding to six
separate images of a strongly lensed LBGs at z = 3.038.
(Frye et al. 2007). Two images of the source are present in
the MUSE ﬁeld of view, namely 1c and 1f. As shown by Frye
et al. (2007), this galaxy exhibits a complex behavior that
is highlighted by magniﬁcation, providing an enhanced spa-
tial resolution. The spectrum is dominated by absorption in
image 1a, displaying a complex Lyman-α proﬁle across the
galaxy, whereas a strong Lyman-α emission is found in im-
age 1c. We here conﬁrm the redshift found for 1c and provide
an additional proof of the reality of this arc by conﬁrming
the Lyman-α emission of 1f. Before our survey, only a pho-

the whole distribution (z = 0.1891). Solid lines display the best Gaus-
sian ﬁt to the whole sample. Long and short dashed lines display the

ens the redshift distribution in the cluster core. Figure 2 also
displays the best ﬁt found when considering two independent
components, the main cluster component with σ = 1200 ± 51
km/s, and the group component with σ = 600 ± 68 km/s. The
velocity oﬀset between the two subclumps is 4030 km/s. As a
consequence of this eﬀect, the mean redshift is slightly biased
toward a higher value than in previous ﬁndings, that is, a value
close to z = 0.188 compared to z = 0.184 in the references given
above. The redshift of the main cluster component is fully con-
sistent with z = 0.184. There is no obvious trend in the spatial
distribution of galaxies belonging to the group across the MUSE
ﬁeld of view.

We have also checked the consistency between our redshifts
for galaxies in the center of the cluster with respect to existing
data, being aware that spectroscopic targets were more sparsely
sampled in previous surveys. Three galaxies of our sample are in
common with Teague et al. (1990) (708, 710, and 711 in Fig. 1),
and four galaxies with Czoske (2004, and private communica-
tion), (545, 713, 777, and 732 in Fig. 1). The average diﬀerence
is consistent with zero: < dz >=0.0001±0.001.

The results above show that MUSE is able to catch the small-
scale substructure in particularly dense environments, a diﬃcult
task for standard multi-slit specrographs. This result supports the
method adopted by Limousin et al. (2007, hereafter L07) to op-
timize the lensing mass-modeling in this cluster, based on obser-
vations by Czoske (2004) for the cluster dynamics and 32 mul-
tiply imaged systems known in this cluster at that epoch. They
used a parametric reconstruction of the mass-distribution based
on the superposition of two dominant dark-matter clumps, with
σ = 1200 and 540 km/s, respectively, to reproduce the large-
scale component. A reﬁned version of the L07 model is used in
this paper (see Sect. 4).

4. Lensed sources behind A1689
Previous to our survey, 28 diﬀerent lensed galaxies displaying 46
multiple images were known in the MUSE ﬁeld of view, most of
them based on photometric redshifts together with lensing con-
siderations (see, e.g., Limousin et al. 2007; Frye et al. 2007; Tu
et al. 2008; Coe et al. 2010). Of these, we have been able to con-
ﬁrm 12 images corresponding to 7 diﬀerent lensed galaxies be-

addition to this result, an extended emission is also observed
associated with 619(1c), with two main Lyman-α extensions
labeled LN23 and LN24 in Table 2, as shown in Fig. 6. Given
the location of 1f within the BCG region and its smaller mag-
niﬁcation, the counter images of LN23 and LN24 could not
be detected.

– System 4 (750(4a), 518(4b), and L4e): This ﬁve-image sys-
tem was described for the ﬁrst time by L07, who provided a

ﬁrst spectroscopic z = 1.1, in agreement with the photomet-
ric redshifts derived by C10. A precise spectroscopic red-
shift was used by Jullo et al. (2010), fully consistent with the
present value. We here spectroscopically conﬁrm the system
as being the multiple image of a source at z = 1.164, based
on the detection of the same identical emission-line doublet
of [OII]3727 in the three images included in the MUSE ﬁeld
of view.

emission in this source might be sampled diﬀerently in the
two images. In addition, we conﬁrm the spectroscopic red-
shift of a counter-image located within the BCG area, la-
beled LN16 in Table 2. Our results are fully consistent with
a three-image system, as suggested by previous authors.

– System 17 (L17a): We spectroscopically conﬁrm the red-
shift of the three-image system 17 in C10 as z = 2.661, based
on identifying the emission-line doublet of CIII]1909. This
value agrees well with the photometric and lensing redshifts
around z = 2.7±0.5 estimated by L07 and C10.

– System 26 (L26b): We spectroscopically conﬁrm the red-
shift of the three-image system 26 in C10 as z = 0.959, based
on identifying the emission-line doublet of [OII]3727. This
value agrees excellently well with the photometric and lens-
ing redshifts z = 0.9±0.2 estimated by C10. In addition, the
counter-image 26c in C10, which has a smaller magniﬁca-
tion factor of ∼3.2, is also detected as a faint emission seen
in the 3D MUSE cube, but it is too faint to be successfully
extracted. These results fully conﬁrm the lensing system.

– System 46 (944(46a) and LN22): This highly magniﬁed
double-image system was reported in C10 with uncertain
photometric redshifts for the two images. Here we measure
a redshift z = 3.483 based on an emission line identiﬁed
as Lyman-α. The two objects showing this emission on the
1.5(cid:48)(cid:48)diameter aperture are located side by side, but the emis-
sion line is clearly centered on LN22, lacking a clear coun-
terpart in the HST/ACS images, as shown in Fig. 8. Based on
these measurements, it is more likely a three-image system,
with two images located within the MUSE ﬁeld. The fainter
counter-images are expected to be located within the central
(noisy) region, with ﬂuxes (∼1×10−18 erg/s/cm2) that are too
faint to be detected with a signiﬁcant S/N in this area.

– System 50 (L50a, 588(50b) and L50c): MUSE spec-
troscopy has allowed us to conﬁrm this spectacular three-
image system based on the detection of a strong emission-
line identiﬁed as Lyman-α for a source at z = 4.274, and
seen in the three images available in this ﬁeld. Previous pho-
tometric redshifts reported by C10 were highly inaccurate
(between z = 2.2 and 3.2). Therefore, these observations al-
low us to conﬁrm the redshift and nature of this system.

cles have diameters of 0.60(cid:48)(cid:48), close to the FWHM seeing measured

emission, from 0.5 to 2×10−19 erg/s/cm2/pix2, with bins of 0.5×10−19

– System 7 (1379(7b), 1401, and LN16): The multiply im-
aged system 7 was previously identiﬁed by Frye et al. (2002)
and later discussed by L07 and C10, who provided a photo-
metric and lensing-motivated identiﬁcation for 7b. Frye et al.
(2002) and Richard et al. (2011) reported a redshift z = 4.860
for the 7a component, which is located outside the MUSE
ﬁeld, based on the detection of Lyman-α emission for the
former and the [OII]3727 in the near-IR for the latter. Here
we conﬁrm the nature of this system, with a spectroscopic
redshift z = 4.874 for 7b, based on a strong emission-line
identiﬁed as Lyman-α. The emission region seems to extend
beyond the image seen on HST data, toward the neighbor-
ing source 1401, as shown in Fig. 7. We note that there is a
diﬀerence in redshift of ∼0.011 (δv∼560 km/s) between the
7b component reported here and the 7a component (using air
wavelength reference for all measurements to be consistent),
which cannot be easily explained. The extended Lyman-α

brightest source seen in the HST image is likely to be a cluster galaxy,
but no spectroscopic redshift could be determined for it.

Unfortunately, only a tentative spectroscopic redshift could
be obtained for the long arcs located southeast in Fig. 1, namely
8a and 8b in C10, despite a strong magniﬁcation. These arcs
were identiﬁed by C10 as two images of the same source, with
photometric and lensing redshifts of 1.8±0.5 and 2.22, respec-
tively. Extracted spectra are very noisy, and strong spectral fea-
tures such as [OII]3727 and Lyman-α are not expected within
the MUSE wavelength domain. Here we propose a tentative red-
shift of z = 2.661, mainly based on several consistent absorption
features, such as CII 1334, SiIV 1393 + OIV 1402, FeII 1608,
and AlII 1670. A faint emission-line is also detected in one of
the portions of 8a, consistent with CIII]1909, but the S/N ratio
is very low compared to the other line emitters discussed here.
A longer exposure time and further investigation are needed to
fully conﬁrm this redshift.

4.2. New multiply imaged sources behind A1689
As a result of this survey, 14 new background sources were iden-
tiﬁed behind A1689, as reported in Table 2. All of them gener-
ate multiply imaged systems, identiﬁed from N= 51 to 64 (in
continuity with respect to C10). In two cases, we were able to
spectroscopically conﬁrm the identiﬁcation of (at least) two such
images:
– System 51 (1339 and LN20): 1339 is a highly magniﬁed
image of a source at z = 0.775, based on the identiﬁca-
tion of several emission-lines, mainly [OIII]5007,4959, Hβ,
Hγ, NeIII, the [OII]3727 doublet, and MgII. LN20 is an im-
age extracted within the BCG area and displays the same
(main) emission lines. These two images are consistent with
a new three-image system, with two images located within
the MUSE ﬁeld of view. In this case, magniﬁcations aﬀecting
1339 and LN20 are ∼13 and ∼2, respectively, which agrees
well with the relative line ﬂuxes. The third image is found
as expected in the ﬁeld that is covered by HST images, with
m(775W)=25.1 and magniﬁcation ∼5.
– System 52 (1028, 1045 and LN12): 1028 is a highly mag-
niﬁed image of a source at z = 3.112, based on the iden-

Article number, page 8 of 12

tiﬁcation of Lyman-α and CIV seen in emission. Lyman-
α in emission is also seen at the same redshift in a re-
gion associated with 1045 (in the close neighborhood of
1028), as shown in Fig. 9. The system is consistent with a
new three-image source, with two images located within the
MUSE ﬁeld of view, namely 1028 (and its Lyman-α exten-
sion 1045), and LN12, which were extracted within the BCG
area. The third image is identiﬁed in the ﬁeld covered by
HST images, with m(775W)=26.9 and magniﬁcation ∼4.
Some newly discovered sources in this ﬁeld deserve a special

mention.
– Systems 53, 54, and 55 (LN9, 1404, and 835): These three
images display a similar redshift z∼3.18. However, based on
the lensing model, they cannot be reconciled with a multiple-
image system. LN9 and 1404 are two independent systems
with three multiple images each, two of them within the
MUSE ﬁeld, namely the image detected and another counter-
image within the BCG region that is about ﬁve times fainter
for LN9 and de-magniﬁed (µ ∼0.03) for 1404. A candidate
third image could be extracted for system 54 at the expected
position in the ﬁeld covered by HST images, close to a bright
cluster galaxy, with m(775W)=27.4. In contrast, there is no
obvious counterpart for the faint continuum emission associ-
ated with LN9 despite a 1.2 times larger magniﬁcation, but
the image is expected in the close neighborhood of a particu-
larly crowded region. 835 is more likely a double-image sys-
tem, with a de-magniﬁed counter-image located within the
BCG region.
– System 56 (LN10): This image displays the largest magni-
ﬁcation of the sample (µ ∼75). It is most likely a new three-
image source at z∼3.419, with two images located within the
MUSE ﬁeld of view. The magniﬁcation of the counter-image
expected within the BCG area is µ ∼9, yielding a ﬂux below
∼2×10−18 erg/s/cm2, which is too faint to be detected in this
area. There is an extremely faint object in the ﬁeld covered
by HST images, with m(775W)∼28 and magniﬁcation ∼8,
which is a good candidate to the third image.
For all newly discovered galaxies, in addition to those dis-
cussed above, we checked the consistency of the lensing con-

ﬁguration by identifying possible counter-image candidates pre-
dicted in the ﬁeld covered by HST data. For images lacking a de-
tection in the continuum (systems 57, 58, 61, 63, and 64), there
is no obvious counter-image in HST data. The only exception is
system 62, for which a faint arclet is detected at the predicted
position, with m(775W)=27.6 and magniﬁcation ∼15.5, that is,
a larger magniﬁcation than in the image seen in the MUSE ﬁeld.
There is no obvious counter-part for the faint systems 59 and 60.
In the ﬁrst case, the magniﬁcation is expected to be 1.2 times
larger, but the image is predicted in the close neighborhood of
a bright cluster galaxy. In the second case, the counter-image is
expected to be ∼0.4 magnitudes fainter.

4.3. Discussion
All background sources detected within the MUSE ﬁeld of view
correspond to multiply imaged systems. The spectroscopic im-
ages described above are consistent with this fact. In most cases,
they correspond to three- or ﬁve-image systems with at least two
images located within the MUSE ﬁeld. The detection of coun-
terparts within the BCG area, with observed line ﬂuxes expected
to be around or below ∼2×10−18 erg/s/cm2, is simply unfeasible.
Therefore, in the majority of cases presented above, there is no
spectroscopic conﬁrmation of the multiple system, and this is a
very common situation in the literature (i.e., the spectroscopic
redshift being available for only one of the images in a multi-
ple system). However, for sources exhibiting a continuum (i.e.,
detected in HST images), we have identiﬁed possible counter-
parts outside the ﬁeld of MUSE. The mass-model used in this
analysis is accurate enough to permit a good determination of
magniﬁcation factors and related quantities and to identify mul-
tiple systems. A new revised mass-model, including all the new
multiple images discussed above, will be presented in a coming
paper (Richard et al., in preparation).
Compared to the sample of 26 bright well-behaved Lyman-α
emitters observed by MUSE in the HDFS at z ≥ 2.9 and display-
ing extended Lyman-α emission (i.e., isolated, non-AGN galax-
ies Bacon et al. 2015; Wisotzki et al. 2015), our sample is in-
trinsically fainter, with Lyman-α luminosities ranging between
40.5 <∼ log(L)[erg.s−1] <∼ 42.5 after correction for magniﬁcation.
As a result of the relatively short exposure time and because
these observations were performed close to the extended halo of
BCG in the cluster core, we do not discuss the extended Lyman-
α emission around individual sources here. However, such an
emission is clearly observed in at least four cases as described
above (systems 1c, 7b, 46a, and 52; see Figs. 6 to 9).

When we compare the distribution of lens-corrected Lyman-
α luminosities for the 17 galaxies found behind A1689 at 3 <∼ z <∼ 7
to a compilation of representative spectroscopic samples from
the literature (see Fig. 10), the complementarity between classi-
cal blank-ﬁeld and lensing studies is obvious. Lyman-α emitters
observed by MUSE in lensing clusters nicely extend the acces-
sible domain in luminosity between one and two orders of mag-
nitude beyond classical LAE surveys. The luminosities reached
here are comparable with those attained by Rauch et al. (2008)
in their ∼90h exposure with VLT/FORS2 (gray triangles in Fig.
10). The present sample also reaches fainter limits than the sur-
vey conducted on the HDFS by Bacon et al. (2015), in particular
at z(cid:39)4, which is due to the speciﬁc pointing covering the highest
magniﬁcation regime in this particularly eﬃcient cluster.

A high magniﬁcation value also translates into a small ef-
fective surface or volume covered by the survey on the corre-
sponding source planes. To evaluate this eﬀect, we computed
the eﬀective volume covered by the survey in the diﬀerent red-

galaxies found behind A1689 at 3 ≤ z ≤ 7 (red squares), as compared
to Bacon et al. (2015) (blue diamonds), and to a compilation of repre-
sentative samples of LAE from the literature (gray symbols): 2(cid:47)z(cid:47)3.8
(Blanc et al. 2011) (HETDEX Pilot Survey), 2.7(cid:47)z(cid:47)3.8 (gray triangles)
(Rauch et al. 2008), z∼4.9 (Shioya et al. 2009), z∼5.7 (Shimasaku et al.
2006; Ouchi et al. 2008; Henry et al. 2012; Hu et al. 2010), and z∼6.5
(Ouchi et al. 2010; Hu et al. 2010; Kashikawa et al. 2011).

shift bins from z∼3.5 to z∼6.5, with redshift slices of ∆z = 0.5.
A mask was used to remove the areas contaminated by the cen-
tral BCGs, where faint sources typically below a few ∼ ×10−18
erg/s/cm2 could not be detected. This mask accounts for ∼11%
of the total surface. We integrated the eﬀective volume outside
the mask using the same approach as in Richard et al. (2006),
that is, the surface of each pixel was reduced by the correspond-
ing magniﬁcation (depending on position and redshift). We used
Lenstool and the same lensing model as in Sect. 3 to derive the
magniﬁcation maps for each redshift slice. The total eﬀective
covolume obtained in this way in the ﬁeld of view of MUSE is
∼145 Mpc3 at 3 <∼ z <∼ 7, whereas it is ∼2300 Mpc3 in a blank ﬁeld.
Figure 11 displays the comparison between the density of
sources obtained in this way within the whole 3 <∼ z <∼ 7 interval,
and expectations based on the extrapolation of the luminosity
function (LF) toward the low-luminosity regime covered by the
present survey. Luminosity bins were deﬁned to keep at least
three sources per bin, and they are independent. Given the small
number of sources, we did not introduce any correction for in-
completeness at this stage, knowing that incompleteness is ex-
pected to aﬀect in particular the faintest bins in Fig. 11. Error
bars in this ﬁgure include Poisson noise statistics that aﬀect the
number of galaxies found in a given luminosity bin, as well as
an estimate of the ﬁeld-to-ﬁeld variance, added in quadrature.
Field-to-ﬁeld variance was estimated using the public cosmic
variance calculator by Trenti & Stiavelli (2008). The error bud-
get is clearly dominated by Poisson noise in this case.

Given the intrinsic low luminosities in our sample, we are
particularly sensitive to the value of the slope parameter α, for
which a constant value is assumed in other surveys presented in
Figs. 10 and 11, where the ﬁt is only sensitive to L∗ and the nor-
malization. Despite these caveats discussed above regarding the
small size of this sample, the density of intrinsically faint sources
observed in this ﬁeld is roughly consistent with the steepest val-
ues used by the diﬀerent authors to ﬁt their data, namely α ≤

emission. All background sources detected within the MUSE
ﬁeld of view correspond to multiply imaged systems, in most
cases three- or ﬁve-image systems with at least two images
located within the MUSE ﬁeld.
– In total, 17 sources are found at z ≥ 3 based on their
Lyman-α emission, with Lyman-α luminosities ranging be-
tween 40.5 <∼ log(Lyα) <∼ 42.5 after correction for magniﬁca-
tion. Four of these systems display extended Lyman-α emis-
sion. Our sample is intrinsically fainter than the usual sam-
ples available in the literature, in particular at z ≥ 4, and com-
parable to the faintest samples currently available at lower
redshifts (e.g., the sample Lyman-α emitters observed by
MUSE in the HDFS at z ≥ 2.9 Bacon et al. 2015; Wisotzki
et al. 2015). Given the intrinsically low luminosities, this
sample is particularly sensitive to the slope of the LF toward
the faintest-end. The density of sources obtained in this sur-
vey is roughly consistent with a steep value of α ≤ −1.5,
although this result still needs further investigation.

These results illustrate the eﬃciency of MUSE in character-
izing lensing clusters on one hand, and studying faint and distant
populations of galaxies on the other hand. In particular, our cur-
rent survey of lensing clusters is expected to provide a unique
census of sources responsible for the reionization in a limited
representative volume at z∼4-7.

for completeness in the faintest bins will exacerbate this trend.

ing larger samples of LAE in this low-luminosity domain. A full

clusters will be presented elsewhere in a forthcoming paper.

To summarize, these are the main results we obtained:

– Based on guided-and-manual and automated (blind) ap-
proaches, a census of sources was obtained in the ﬁeld of
MUSE, most of which are cluster galaxies. The spectro-
scopic census is complete out to m(775W) < 21.5. The spec-
troscopic sample includes 63 cluster galaxies with secure
redshifts (49 of them with m(775W) < 21.5). The veloc-
ity distribution of cluster galaxies is more complex than the
smooth Gaussian distribution found for this cluster on larger
scales, with a main cluster component with σ = 1200 km/s,
and the signature of the NE group component, with σ = 600
km/s. This demonstrates that MUSE data are able to catch the
small-scale substructure in particularly dense environments,
a diﬃcult exercise for usual multi-slit spectrographs. This
result supports the mass-model method adopted by L07 and
used throughout the paper to retrieve lens-corrected quanti-
ties.

– We are able to conﬁrm 12 images for background sources
that correspond to 7 diﬀerent lensed galaxies between z =
0.95 and 5.0 of the 28 diﬀerent lensed galaxies known or
suspected within the MUSE ﬁeld of view. In addition, 14
new galaxies were spectroscopically identiﬁed in this area
thanks to MUSE data, with redshifts ranging between 0.8 and
6.2, the majority of them identiﬁed based on their Lyman-α
