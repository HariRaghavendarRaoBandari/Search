We explore magnetic behavior of kagome francisites Cu3Bi(SeO3)2O2X (X = Cl and Br) using
ﬁrst-principles calculations. To this end, we propose an approach based on the Hubbard model
in the Wannier functions basis constructed on the level of local-density approximation (LDA). The
ground-state spin conﬁguration is determined by a Hartree-Fock solution of the Hubbard model both
in zero magnetic ﬁeld and in applied magnetic ﬁelds. Additionally, parameters of an eﬀective spin
Hamiltonian are obtained by taking into account the hybridization eﬀects and spin-orbit coupling.
We show that only the former approach, the Hartree-Fock solution of the Hubbard model, allows for
a complete description of the anisotropic magnetization process. While our calculations conﬁrm that
the canted zero-ﬁeld ground state arises from a competition between ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor
and antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor couplings in the kagome planes, weaker anisotropic
terms are crucial for ﬁxing spin directions and for the overall magnetization process. We thus show
that the Hartree-Fock solution of an electronic Hamiltonian is a viable alternative to the analysis of
eﬀective spin Hamiltonians when a magnetic ground state and eﬀects of external ﬁeld are considered.

INTRODUCTION

The interest in novel frustrated magnets is continu-
ously increasing because of the diversity of their crystal
structures and magnetic conﬁgurations leading in turn to
many interesting phenomena that may be relevant to ap-
plications, such as spintronics.1,2 For example, systems
composed of S = 1
2 spins on a two-dimensional kagome-
type lattice are usually strongly frustrated due to com-
peting exchange couplings that give rise to various exotic
ground-states and peculiar properties at ﬁnite tempera-
tures and in applied magnetic ﬁelds.3

Due to diﬃculties in synthesizing inorganic compounds
with a low-dimensional arrangement of transition-metal
cations, one usually resorts to special strategies for their
construction. For instance, inorganic polyanionic groups
can be used as a crystal structure spacer to form open
volumes excluding bonding along one or two directions of
the crystal structure. An ideal candidate for this purpose
are the stereochemically active lone-pair cations (Se+4 or
Bi+3), which are large enough to expand crystal struc-
ture and form bonds only with oxygen ions.4,5 Moreover,
halogens are also often used, as they typically have low
coordination numbers and additionally act as terminat-
ing species.6

Cu3Bi(SeO3)2O2X with X = Cl, Br and I, hereinafter
referred to as CBSOOX, are geometrically frustrated lay-
ered compounds with non-collinear magnetic ordering.7
They can be derived from the natural mineral francisite
and crystallize in the orthorhombic P mmn structure.
This structure can be described as formed by copper(II)-
oxygen layers with two nonequivalent copper sites. Cu1
and Cu2 of the site symmetries −1 and mm2, respec-
tively, that build up a hexagonal network of CuO4 square

plaquettes linked together by Se+4 and Bi3+ ions with
diﬀerent out-of-plane oxygen bonding. This geometry
can be regarded as a buckled kagome-type lattice.

Anisotropic magnetic properties of CBSOOX were
studied by bulk magnetization measurements7 and
single-crystal neutron diﬀraction8 that revealed the mag-
netic ordering transition at TN = 24.7 K. In zero ﬁeld,
CBSOOBr is ordered antiferromagnetically. Magnetic
moments on the Cu2 sites point along the c axis, whereas
those on the Cu1 sites are canted from c towards b, thus
producing the net magnetic moment within each layer in
the ab plane. These moments cancel out macroscopically
because of the weakly antiferromagnetic interlayer cou-
pling that can be overridden by a magnetic ﬁeld BC ≈ 0.8
T applied along the c axis. External ﬁeld triggers a meta-
magnetic transition, wherein magnetic moments in ev-
ery second layer ﬂip, and the net magnetic moment is
formed macroscopically.8,9 Qualitatively similar behavior
was observed for the Cl compound10, although no details
of its magnetic structure were reported.

Rousochatzakis et al.11 used density-functional cal-
culations to derive isotropic and anisotropic exchange
couplings in kagome francisites.
They have shown
that the canted spin order in the ab plane originates
from the competition between ferromagnetic nearest-
neighbor (J1 (cid:39) −70 K) and antiferromagnetic next-
nearest-neighbor (J2 (cid:39) 50 K) interactions. The leading
Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya component along the a direction
(d1a in the notation of Ref. 11) restricts spins to the bc
plane. However, the alignment of the net moment with
the c direction could not be reproduced, and details of
the anisotropic magnetization process were not described
quantitatively.

kagome francisites. For example, these compounds ex-
hibit ﬁeld- and temperature-dependent microwave ab-
sorption over a broad range of frequencies. This eﬀect
can be used for microwave ﬁltering12 and calls for a quan-
titative microscopic description of the magnetization pro-
cess. In the following, we will show how this description
can be achieved. The novelty of our approach lies in the
direct treatment of the electronic Hamiltonian, where all
isotropic and anisotropic exchange couplings are included
implicitly. We then use the same band structure to derive
parameters of the eﬀective spin Hamiltonian, and demon-
strate salient diﬀerences between these two approaches.

II. GROUND-STATE PROPERTIES

Electronic-structure calculations have been performed
in terms of the conventional local-density approxima-
tion (LDA)13 and projected augmented waves (PAW)
formalisms14, as implemented in the Vienna ab-initio
simulation package.15 Hopping parameters including
the spin-orbit interaction have been calculated in the
Quantum-ESPRESSO package.16 In our calculations, we
adopt the experimental crystallographic data obtained
from single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction studies (Fig. 1a).7

The LDA band structure of CBSOOX is presented
in Fig. 1b. One of the most important features of the
electronic structure is the presence of six bands located

near the Fermi level and well separated from the rest
of the spectrum. The main contribution to these bands
comes from copper 3dx2−y2
states, which are strongly hy-
bridized with oxygen 2p orbitals. There is also a small
contribution coming from selenium and bismuth ions. To
parametrize the LDA results, we have constructed the
maximally-localized Wannier functions centered on the
copper sites by projecting the Bloch states located near
the Fermi level onto dx2−y2
orbitals.17,18 As one can see
from Fig. 1c, every two Wannier functions overlap only on
one oxygen site (O1) giving rise to the so-called Coulomb
contribution to the total exchange.19 The resulting func-
tions have a noticeable contribution from both oxygen
and selenium atomic orbitals, so they can be roughly ex-
pressed as the following linear combinations:

W1 = α1φx2−y2

Cu1 + 2β1φp

O1 + 2β2φp

O2 + 2γφSe

and

W2 = α2φx2−y2

Cu2 + 2β1φp

for Cu1 and Cu2 types, respectively, where contributions
from bismuth and halogen orbitals are supposed to be
negligible. These expansion coeﬃcients for the Wannier
functions can be estimated by using magnetic moments
obtained from LSDA+U calculations.

To reproduce the insulating ground states of the CB-
SOOX compounds, we performed LSDA+U calculations.

In these calculations the value of the on-site Coulomb in-

sen to be 9 eV and 1 eV, respectively. We have obtained
the energy gap of 2.9 eV, which is close to the typical val-
ues for low-dimensional copper oxides. The calculated
atomic magnetic moments used to estimate the expan-
sion coeﬃcients for the Wannier functions are presented
in Table I and also indicate a strong metal-ligand hy-
bridization.

To describe electronic and magnetic properties of CB-
SOOX, we construct the following one-orbital Hubbard

is the element of the hopping matrix with spin-orbit cou-
pling. The transfer integrals are to be found from a Wan-
nier parametrization of the ﬁrst-principle band structure
(LDA+SO) including spin-orbit coupling.18 The results
are presented in Table III. One can see that the matrices
between nearest neighbors contain large imaginary and
non-diagonal elements that, as we will show below, are re-
sponsible for anisotropic exchange interactions. In turn,
parameters UR and J H
RR(cid:48) for the one-orbital model have
been estimated by using the on-site Coulomb interaction
for the 3d shell of the copper atom and intra-atomic ex-
change interaction of the ligand atoms as described in
Ref. 19.

The constructed model Eq. (3) can be solved in the
mean-ﬁeld Hartree-Fock approximation, which gives us
an opportunity to study ﬁeld dependence of the mag-
netic ground state. Alternatively, one can evaluate
both isotropic and anisotropic exchange interactions us-

the isotropic exchange interaction is expressed in the fol-

The ﬁrst term in Eq.(5) is the kinetic Anderson’s ex-
change interaction taking into account spin-orbit cou-
pling, while the second one is a ferromagnetic exchange
coming from the overlap of the Wannier functions.19 As
it is seen from Fig. 2, it has a non-zero value for the 1–4
and 1–5 pairs. Generally, J H
RR(cid:48) in Eq.5 can be estimated
directly from LDA+SO calculations by integrating the
corresponding combination of the Wannier functions. On
the other hand, its value can be approximated as follows:

intraplane FM coupling deﬁned by the nearest-neighbor
Cu1–Cu2 and Cu1–Cu1 interactions, J15 and J14, respec-
tively. The dominant intraplane AFM exchange interac-
tion J13 is found between the neighboring Cu1 sites, for
which the corresponding magnetic orbitals do not overlap
on the oxygen atoms. This coupling is about two times
smaller than the FM one. Our results are in good agree-
ment with the previous theoretical analysis11 that arrived
at the values of J13 = 4.74 (5.08) meV, J14 = −6.54
(−6.46) meV and J15 = −5.68 (−5.77) for X = Cl (Br).

However, they are rather diﬀerent from the experimen-
tally predicted ratio of ≈1.6, where the AFM interaction
dominates.8 The copper atoms in the adjacent layers are
coupled antiferromagnetically, and the interplane interac-
tion is essentially weak (about 10–20 times smaller than
the corresponding intraplane interactions). The isotropic
exchange parameters are very similar for X=Cl or Br,
that implies a small contribution of halogen’s p–states to
the localized bands near the Fermi level.

where σ is a vector of the Pauli matrices. The values of
anisotropic exchange parameters are presented in Table
III. The dominant anisotropic exchange coupling is found
between the nearest neighbors Cu1 and Cu2, and its com-
ponent along the a axis is by far the largest among the
DM couplings. The value of D15 is mostly determined
by the relatively large hopping parameters t15. Moreover,
the a component of D15 has diﬀerent orientations in two
adjacent hexagonal networks of the same ab layer, and
is responsible for the stabilization of the canted mag-
netic order.11 Our results for the exchange parameters
obtained within Moriya’s microscopic theory are in good
agreement with the ones estimated from LDA+U+SO
total energies.11

In the absence of external magnetic ﬁeld, we ﬁnd
a canted order in the ab planes and antiferromagnetic
stacking of such ferrimagnetic layers (Fig. 3a). Magnetic
moments at the Cu2 sites are strictly parallel to the c
axis, while magnetic moments at the Cu1 sites alternate
from this parallel direction towards the b axis and form a
canted magnetic texture with the bc angles θ = 50.1◦ and
53.8◦ for X = Cl and Br, respectively. This result is in
good agreement with the experimental8 and theoretical11
values of the canting angle θ for X=Br, 51.6◦ and 52.1◦,
respectively. The corresponding magnetic moments for
X = Cl and Br are mCu1 = (0.01, 0.77, 0.64) µB and
mCu2 = (0.0, 0.0, 1.0) µB, mCu1 = (0.0, 0.81, 0.59) µB
and mCu2 = (0.0, 0.0, 1.0) µB, respectively. These
directions are close to those obtained from the neu-
tron diﬀraction measurements8 for X=Br, mCu1 =
(0.0, 0.72, 0.57) µB and mCu2 = (0.0, 0.0, 0.90) µB. On
the other hand, quantum renormalization of the mag-
netic moments (reduction from 1.0 µB to ∼ 0.9 µB due
to quantum ﬂuctuations11) is not taken into account.

By applying symmetry operations of the P mmn space
group, it follows that the magnetic ground state corre-
sponds to the Γ3 representation for both Cu sites. This
representation allows for an additional canting out of the

be indeed present in kagome francisites, although it has
not been detected in the experiment so far. Indeed, our
zero-ﬁeld ground state derived from the Hartree-Fock so-
lution of the electronic Hamiltonian features a weak out-
of-plane canting γ = 0.8◦ and 0.4◦ for X = Cl and Br,
respectively. The out-of-plane canting involves only the

In the case of an external magnetic ﬁeld B (cid:107) c, the

and 0.74 T for X = Cl and Br, respectively (Fig. 3b), in

the AFM components are still present, we do not observe

netization up to ∼ 17.0 T and ∼ 16.0 T for X = Cl and

D15.

VI. ELECTRONIC VS. SPIN HAMILTONIANS

We are now in a position to compare our Hartree-
Fock solution of the electronic Hamiltonian to the eﬀec-
tive spin Hamiltonian obtained from the same LDA+SO
band structure. To this end, we use several characteris-
tic parameters derived in Ref. 11. The primary canting
angle θ and the out-of-plane canting angle γ are given
by:

J13 sin 2θ + J15 sin θ + Da

15 cos θ − Da

13 cos 2θ = 0, (13)

and

γ =

The slopes of the magnetization curves for B (cid:107) a and
B (cid:107) c are given by κa and κc, as follows:

In Table IV, we also list experimental values along with
the results of Ref. 11, where parameters of the spin
Hamiltonian are obtained from LDA+U+SO calcula-
tions.
The

spin Hamiltonian
parametrized via LDA+SO or LDA+U+SO calcu-
lations are qualitatively very similar, while minor
quantitative diﬀerences can be traced back to diﬀerent
band-structure codes. The most tangible discrepancy is
seen for the primary canting angle θ, where LDA+SO
underestimates the canting because of the overestimated
ferromagnetic couplings J14 and J15. This overestimate
is likely related to the approximate nature of Eq. (6) for
non-90◦ ferromagnetic superexchange.

The Hartree-Fock solution of the electronic Hamilto-
nian mitigates the problem of the ferromagnetic superex-
change and results in the realistic value of θ. Even more
importantly, this solution largely improves the descrip-
tion of the magnetization curves, where, for example,
LDA+SO and LDA+U+SO underestimate Wb by an or-
der of magnitude. The Hartree-Fock solution correctly
puts spins on the Cu2 atoms (and thus the net moment)
along the c axis, which is not expected from the spin
Hamiltonian, where both b- and c-components of D15
(d1b and d1c in the notation of Ref. 11) are clearly non-
negligible suggesting a tilted direction of the net moment
in the bc plane.

VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

process can be modeled.

We have shown that the spin Hamiltonian approach
has its limitations for description of the magnetic
anisotropy in kagome francisites. Deﬁciencies of the spin
Hamiltonian are related to the fact that only the lead-
ing isotropic and anisotropic exchange couplings were in-
cluded in the theoretical analysis of Ref. 11. For ex-
ample, symmetric components of the anisotropy, albeit
weak, can also aﬀect spin directions and peculiarities of
the magnetization process, but in a complex system like
francisite the inclusion of the symmetric anisotropy ren-
ders the spin Hamiltonian cumbersome and makes the
whole problem intractable for analytical or numerical so-
lution.
In this case, the Hartree-Fock solution of the
electronic Hamiltonian provides a viable alternative that
delivers ground-state magnetic conﬁguration both in zero
and applied magnetic ﬁelds, so that the magnetization

Our approach also has its limitations. Eﬀects of ther-
mal ﬂuctuations are not included, such that only zero-
temperature behavior is analyzed, while at zero tempera-
ture eﬀects of quantum ﬂuctuations are largely neglected.
On the other hand, both problems could be solved by a
numerical treatment of the spin Hamiltonian. Therefore,
the approaches based on spin and electronic Hamiltoni-
ans are complimentary. Together they can deliver com-
plete microscopic picture of a magnetic material that has
now been achieved for kagome francisites.
