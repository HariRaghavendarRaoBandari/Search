Extensions of the Standard Model Higgs sector with electroweak charged scalars can possess exotic
‘Higgs’ bosons with vanishing or suppressed couplings to Standard Model fermions. These ‘fermio-
phobic’ scalars, which cannot be produced via gluon fusion, are constrained by LHC measurements
of the 125 GeV Higgs boson to have a small vacuum expectation value. This implies that vector
boson fusion and associated vector boson production are in general suppressed rendering conven-
tional Higgs searches insensitive. However, Drell-Yan Higgs pair production, which is not present in
the SM, can be sizeable even in the limit of vanishing exotic Higgs vacuum expectation value. We
utilize this to show that diphoton searches at 8 TeV LHC already rule out a large class of neutral
fermiophobic Higgs bosons below ∼ 110 GeV. This includes fermiophobic scalars found in two Higgs
doublet as well as Higgs triplet and Georgi-Machacek type models. Our results extend the only
relevant limit on fermiophobic Higgs bosons obtained by a recent CDF analysis of 4γ + X Tevatron
data. Furthermore, diphoton limits are independent of the decay of the second Higgs boson and thus
apply even for degenerate masses in contrast to the CDF search. We also ﬁnd that if the fermiopho-
bic Higgs has very enhanced couplings to photons, masses as large as ∼ 150 GeV can be ruled out
while if these couplings are somehow highly suppressed, masses below ∼ 90 GeV can still be ruled
out. Finally, we show that W W and ZZ diboson searches may serve as complementary probes for
masses above the diphoton limit up to ∼ 250 GeV and discuss prospects at 13 TeV LHC.

INTRODUCTION

The discovery of the Higgs boson [1, 2] has provided
the ﬁrst direct window into the mechanism of electroweak
symmetry breaking (EWSB). Many models of EWSB
and extensions of the Standard Model (SM) predict en-
larged Higgs sectors, in which the spectrum includes ex-
tra electroweak charged scalars beyond the SM Higgs
doublet. In a number of models, neutral Higgs bosons
with suppressed or vanishing couplings to SM fermions
are present at the weak scale after EWSB. These ‘fermio-
phobic’ Higgs bosons have many generic phenomeno-
logical features which have been considered for some
time [3–15] and searched for previously at LEP [16–19],
Tevatron [20, 21], and LHC [22]. They can be found
in ‘Type I’ two Higgs doublet models [23] in the large
tan β limit [15, 24, 25] as well as Higgs triplet mod-
els [26–33] including the well known Georgi-Macachek
(GM) model [34] and its variations [35–42] or their su-
persymmetric incarnations [43–48]. They can also appear
in non-minimal composite Higgs models [49, 50].

Since these fermiophobic Higgs scalars do not couple to
quarks, production via gluon fusion is not available. Fur-
thermore, as pointed out in [13, 14], if the vacuum ex-
pectation value (vev) of the fermiophobic Higgs is small,
vector boson fusion (VBF) and associated Higgs vec-
tor boson production (VH) quickly become highly sup-
pressed. Since these are the dominant production mech-
anisms in the SM, they have been assumed as the pro-

duction mechanisms in almost all Higgs boson searches
regardless of if they are fermiophobic or not. On the other
hand since LHC measurements of the 125 GeV Higgs bo-
son couplings [51] seem to indicate a SM-like Higgs bo-
son [52], this implies a small vev for any additional exotic
Higgs boson. As these measurements increase in precision
without observing a deviation from the SM prediction,
previous collider searches for fermiophobic Higgs bosons,
which assumed SM-like production mechanisms, become
increasingly obsolete.

However, Drell-Yan (DY) Higgs pair production, which
is not present in the SM, can be sizable even in the limit of
small exotic Higgs vev [13, 14]. Furthermore, as pointed
out many times [10, 24, 53–55], since there is no b¯b de-
cay to compete with, neutral fermiophobic Higgs scalars
(which we refer to as H 0
F ) at low masses can have large
branching ratios to vector boson pairs and in particular
photons. This can be combined with DY pair produc-
tion to place stringent constraints on light fermiophobic
Higgs bosons using multiphoton ﬁnal states. In particu-
lar, the W boson mediated H±H 0
F production channel
(see Fig. 1), followed by H±
→ W ±H 0
F → γγ
decays, leads to a 4γ + X ﬁnal state, which has been pro-
posed as a probe [13, 14] of fermiophobic Higgs bosons
at high energy colliders. Clearly the H±
F de-
cay requires a mass splitting between the charged and
neutral Higgs and, in particular, MH± > MH 0

fermiophobic Higgs is a very recent CDF analysis of pre-
viously collected Tevatron data [56]. This was applied to
fermiophobic Higgs bosons found in Type I two Higgs
doublet models to put constraints for the ﬁrst time and,
in particular, rule out a neutral fermiophobic Higgs boson
below 100 GeV. Constraints in the two dimensional plane
of the charged and neutral Higgs boson masses were also
obtained. Of course in the limit where the mass splitting
goes to zero this multiphoton search can be evaded. In
models with custodial symmetry [57] in the Higgs sector,
which are motivated by electroweak precision data, de-
generate masses between the neutral and charged Higgs is
commonly found (at tree level). This makes CDF searches
in the 4γ + X channel insensitive to these fermiophobic
custodial Higgs scalars 1. Clearly these searches are also
insensitive when MH± < MH 0
In this paper we emphasize that the W mediated
H±H 0
F pair production can also be combined with con-
ventional diphoton searches to probe neutral fermiopho-
bic Higgs bosons. While the signal to background ratio
is worse than in 4γ + X [56], diphoton searches have the
advantage that, being more inclusive, are more model
independent and can probe neutral fermiophobic Higgs
bosons without any reference to the second Higgs bo-
son decay. In particular, they can be applied even in
the custodial limit of degenerate masses as well as when
MH± < MH 0 or if the charged Higgs decays in a way
that is diﬃcult to observe. We ﬁnd that while Tevatron
diphoton searches are not sensitive to fermiophobic Higgs
bosons, the larger production cross sections at 8 TeV
LHC allow a neutral fermiophobic Higgs boson below
90 − 150 GeV to be ruled out depending on particular
model assumptions. For similar assumptions, we ﬁnd that
stronger bounds than those obtained in 4γ+X searches at
Tevatron can be obtained with 8 TeV diphoton searches
at LHC. We also examine, combining the Higgs pair pro-
duction with W W and ZZ diboson searches as a com-
plementary probe to diphoton searches, for larger fermio-
phobic Higgs masses up to ∼ 250 GeV.
Finally, we pay particular attention to the speciﬁc case
of a fermiophobic custodial ﬁveplet scalar found in all in-
carnations of custodial Higgs triplet models [34, 41, 43]
in which the neutral and charged Higgs scalars are pre-
dicted to be degenerate. Thus the CDF 4γ +X search [56]
cannot be applied to this case. We show for the ﬁrst time
that when the W boson loop (see Fig. 3) dominates the
eﬀective couplings to photons, a custodial ﬁveplet scalar
below ∼ 110 GeV is ruled out by 8 TeV LHC diphoton
searches independently of the Higgs triplet vev. Larger
masses possibly up to ∼ 150 GeV can also be ruled out if
charged scalar loops produce large constructive contribu-
tions to the eﬀective photon couplings. We also ﬁnd that

1 Of course if there are additional Higgs scalars which are in dif-
ferent custodial representations than H 0
F , additional Higgs pair
production mechanisms with non-degenerate masses can become
available allowing for 4γ + X limits to again be applied.

diboson searches, and in particular ZZ searches, may be
useful for higher masses allowing us to potentially obtain
limits again for custodial ﬁveplet masses up to ∼ 250 GeV
independently of the Higgs triplet vev.
The paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II we review
the relevant aspects of fermiophobic production and de-
cay for LHC diboson searches. In Sec. III we examine
diphoton and diboson searches at 8 TeV LHC for generic
fermiophobic Higgs scenearios. Finally in Sec. IV we ex-
amine the particular case of a custodial ﬁveplet scalar
before summarizing our conclusions in Sec. V.

II. FERMIOPHOBIC HIGGS BOSON

PRODUCTION AND DECAY

Here we review production and decay of fermiopho-
bic Higgs bosons focusing on the aspects most relevant
for LHC diphoton and diboson searches. In particular
we focus on the limit of small exotic Higgs vev in which
the DY Higgs pair production mechanism is dominant. A
more detailed discussion of fermiophobic Higgs produc-
tion and decays can be found in [4–8, 10–14], and refer-
ences therein, to which we refer the reader for details.

A. Higgs Pair Production

Any extension of the SM Higgs sector by electroweak
charged scalars will possess the pair production chan-
nel mediated by a W boson shown in Fig. 1. Here we
take H 0
F to generically represent our neutral fermiopho-
bic Higgs boson and assume it to be CP even while H±
N
is in an arbitrary SU (2)L⊗ U (1)Y representation labeled
by N which may (or may not) be the same representa-
tion which H 0
F belongs to. The corresponding diagram
involving a Z boson can arise when H±
N is replaced by a
neutral CP odd scalar, but is subdominant to the W me-
diated channel [13]. In general the neutral and charged
components in Fig. 1 can have diﬀerent masses, but as
long as the mass splitting is not too large and both are
suﬃciently light to be produced on-shell, it will not qual-
itatively aﬀect our discussion since we will only be con-
cerned with the neutral fermiophobic Higgs decay.

FIG. 1. The dominant contribution to Higgs pair production
in extensions of the Standard Model Higgs sector.

We can write the W HH vertex schematically as,

VW HH ≡ igCN (p1 − p2)µ

(1)

W±H0FH±Nwhere CN is ﬁxed by the SU (2)L representation and
p1, p2 are the four momenta of the incoming and outgo-
ing scalar momenta. Once EWSB occurs there may (or
may not) be a dependence on the exotic Higgs vev and
mass mixing angles introduced into the vertex, depending
on if the gauge and mass eigenstates are ‘aligned’. The
key point is that, unlike the terms which generate the
W and Z masses or the single coupling of H to pairs of
electroweak vector bosons, VW HH does not necessarily
depend on the exotic Higgs vev and, more importantly,
does not go to zero in the limit of vanishing vev. A more
detailed discussion of how the vertex in Eq. (1) can de-
pend on these various mixing angles in the context of the
two Higgs doublet or Higgs triplet models can be found
in [11, 15, 34, 41, 43] and references therein.

F at the LHC with √s = 8 TeV in the mass range 45−

To see roughly how large these Higgs pair production
cross sections are, we show in Fig. 2 leading order cross
sections for various channels (thick solid curves) involving
H 0
250 GeV. In these curves we have factored out any group
theory factors or mass mixing angles which could enter
in the vertex in Eq. (1) so that the coeﬃcient is simply
given by the SU (2) gauge coupling g. The curves for any
particular model can be obtained by trivial rescaling with
(CN )2 and will not qualitatively change this discussion
which is largely for intuition purposes. Our results are
obtained from Madgraph [58] using a modiﬁed version
of the GM model implementation of [59] and rescaling
appropriately.

all the way up to ∼ 200 GeV at 8 TeV while at 13
TeV (black dotted) it will be increased by roughly a fac-
tor of ∼ 2. If there is a 100 GeV splitting between the
neutral and charged scalars (solid orange) and assuming
MH
the cross section is considerably reduced,
but still (cid:38) O(100) fb all the way up to ∼ 150 GeV. We
also show for comparison the Z mediated H 0
N channel
(blue solid curve) for the same mass splitting which we
see is signiﬁcantly smaller than the W mediated channels,
but again may be relevant for light masses. Note there

are also NLO contributions which may generate (cid:38) O(1)

K-factors for Higgs pair production [63–65], but we do
not explore this issue here as it does not qualitatively
aﬀect our discussion.

F H 0

We also show for comparison in the gray shaded re-
gion the VBF cross section for H 0
F , which depends on
the exotic Higgs vev. We can parametrize this depen-
dence generically through a SM doublet-exotic Higgs ‘vev
mixing angles’ (cθ ≡ cos θ, sθ ≡ sin θ),

cθ =

vh
v

, sθ =

vex
v

(v = 246 GeV),

(2)

where vh is the vev of the mostly SM Higgs doublet ob-
served at 125 GeV and vex represents schematically the
sum (in quadrature), which may also include group the-
ory factors, over all exotic Higgs vev contributions to
EWSB. So sθ essentially parametrizes the relative con-
tribution to the electroweak scale from the exotic Higgs
sector.

With the deﬁnition in Eq. (2) we can then obtain the
VBF cross section by simply rescaling the 8 TeV SM
prediction [60–62] by s2
θ for which we show various con-
tours. These curves implicitly assume that the ratios of
the H 0
F couplings to W W and ZZ pairs equal those of the
SM Higgs. This will not be true for all Higgs bosons found
in exotic Higgs sectors such as for example the custodial
ﬁveplet in custodial Higgs triplet models [34, 41, 43] to
be examined in more detail below. We see clearly that
once the measurements of the Higgs boson at 125 GeV
constrain sθ (cid:28) 1, the VBF production channel quickly
becomes highly suppressed relative to the DY Higgs pair
production channels. Similar behavior can be seen for the
V H production channels which are typically smaller than
the VBF cross sections except at very low masses [60–62].

To summarize, we see that (cid:38) O(100) fb cross sections
are obtained for the pp → H 0
N Higgs pair produc-
tion channel in the mass range 45 − 250 GeV. Crucially
this production mechanism is present even in the limit
of vanishing exotic Higgs vev unlike VBF and VH pro-
duction. As we will see, diphoton and diboson searches

at the 8 TeV are sensitive to (cid:46) O(100) fb cross section

times branching ratios. Thus if the branching ratios to di-
bosons are large, searches at the LHC for pairs of photons
or Z and W bosons should be able to probe fermiophobic
Higgs bosons in this mass range.

In addition to the W HH vertex in Eq. (1), H 0

F will
have couplings to W W and ZZ pairs which are gener-
ated during EWSB and which will be proportional to the
exotic Higgs vev [11, 15, 34, 41, 43]. We can parametrize

(cid:17)

where gZ and gW are ﬁxed by the SU (2)L⊗U (1)Y repre-
sentation to which H 0
F belongs. The factor of sθ deﬁned
in Eq. (2) ensures that as the exotic Higgs vev tends
to zero (i.e. sθ → 0) the H 0
F V V couplings vanish along
with the VBF and VH production mechanisms. Again we
assume we are in an ‘alignment’ limit so that no Higgs
mass mixing angles enter into Eq. (3). However, even in
the case where they do, this dependence largely cancels
when considering branching ratios since it enters as an
overall factor along with the ‘vev mixing angle’ sθ. The
ratio of the gZ and gW couplings,

λW Z = gW /gZ,

(4)

is an important quantity and is ﬁxed by custodial sym-
metry at tree level to be |λW Z| = 1 or |λW Z| = 1/2 for
a custodial singlet and ﬁveplet respectively [66]. Though
sizeable deviations from these two values are in principle
possible, they are diﬃcult to reconcile with electroweak
precision data in a natural way. Therefore, in what fol-
lows we will consider only these two cases. Note also that
a factor of sθ has been implicitly canceled in Eq. (4).

At one loop the gW couplings in Eq. (3) will also gen-
erate eﬀective couplings to γγ and Zγ pairs via the W
boson loops shown in Fig. 3. We can parametrize these
couplings with the eﬀective operators,

where Vµν = ∂µVν −∂νVµ. We again deﬁne similar ratios,
(6)

λV γ = cV γ/gZ,

where V = Z, γ and we have implicitly absorbed a fac-
tor of sθ into cV γ. There are also contributions to the
eﬀective couplings in Eq. (5) from the additional charged
Higgs bosons which are necessarily present. These con-
tributions can be large or small depending on the model
and parameter choice. This can in principle lead to large
enhancements [55] when there is constructive interfer-
ence with the W boson loop, or suppressions if there are
cancellations between the diﬀerent contributions [67, 68]
leading to small cV γ eﬀective couplings.

If there are no exotic states light enough to decay
into, and since there is no b¯b decay to compete with,
the neutral fermiophobic Higgs bosons will decay al-
most entirely into electroweak gauge boson pairs and in
particular photons at low masses [10, 24, 53–55]. Loop
mediated decays to light SM fermions can occur thus

violating the fermiophobic condition, but will be sup-
pressed by the fermion masses and furthermore must
be ﬁxed by renormalization [5, 6] in certain cases. Here
we will assume the fermiophobic condition is maintained
by either an appropriately chosen renormalization condi-
tion [8, 9] or via a symmetry [15] such as custodial sym-
metry [34, 41, 43]. Under these assumptions the branch-
ing ratios of H 0
F will only depend on the ratios in Eq. (4)
and Eq. (6), and in some cases only on λW Z if the W loop
(see Fig. 3) dominates the H 0
F V γ eﬀective couplings. In
this case any sθ dependence in λV γ cancels explicitly.

Since the qualitative behavior of the branching ra-
tios is largely dominated by phase space considerations,
they will share many features in any fermiophobic Higgs
model. At low masses, below ∼ 120 − 150 GeV, the
branching ratio into pairs of photons starts to become
signiﬁcant and quickly dominant below the W mass, or
at higher masses if the couplings to photons are en-
hanced. At larger masses the three and four body de-
cays involving W and Z bosons become relevant and
eventually completely dominant above the W W and ZZ
thresholds. At even higher masses, either the ZZ or W W
branching ratio can be the largest decay mode depending
on the value of the ratio of the couplings, λW Z.

We illustrate these features in Fig. 4 where we show
branching ratios for two diﬀerent fermiophobic Higgs sce-
narios in the mass range 45 − 150 GeV. In both cases we
take |λW Z| = 1, which is possible in all two Higgs doublet
as well as Higgs triplet models. To obtain the three and
four body decays we have integrated the analytic expres-
sions for the H 0
F → V V → 4(cid:96) fully
diﬀerential decay widths computed and validated in [69–
71]. For the explicit W loop functions which contribute
to the eﬀective couplings we use the parametrization and
implementation found in [72].

F → V γ → 2(cid:96)γ and H 0

The ﬁrst scenario (solid curves) assumes the fermio-
phobic Higgs interactions are dominated by the couplings
in Eq. (3). In this case the eﬀective couplings to Zγ and
γγ are generated only by the W loop shown in Fig. 3. This

H0FW±W±VγW±VγW±W±H0FH0FZ,W±Z,W∓5

cays dominate. The same holds true if the eﬀective cou-
plings to γγ and Zγ are highly suppressed due to cancel-
lations. Thus one can again obtain limits on fermiophobic
Higgs bosons which are independent of their vevs. How-
ever, it would be interesting to consider a detailed anal-
ysis of H 0
F masses above the Z mass and below the W W
threshold where all decays can in principle be sizeable si-
multaneously and where the vev dependence can be non-
negligible, but we leave this to an ongoing study.

In both cases considered in Fig. 4 we see the univer-
sal features of a fermiophobic Higgs boson. Namely, large
branching ratios into photons at lower masses and large
branching ratios to W W and ZZ at larger masses. As
we will demonstrate below, these diboson decays can be
combined along with the Higgs pair production mech-
anism to provide stringent constraints on a variety of
fermiophobic Higgs scenarios and, in some cases, these
constraints being independent of the exotic Higgs vev or
Higgs mixing eﬀects.

III. PROBING FERMIOPHOBIC HIGGS

BOSONS AT THE LHC

N H 0

→ H±
F H±

With this discussion of fermiophobic Higgs boson pro-
duction and decays in mind, we now examine the possi-
bility of using diphoton and diboson searches at the LHC
to search for fermiophobic Higgs bosons. In what follows
we will consider only the pp → W ±
F Higgs pair
production mechanism shown in Fig. 1, where H 0
F and
H±
N can be degenerate or have a large mass splitting. We
again consider the ‘normalized’ H 0
N Higgs pair pro-
duction channels discussed in Fig. 2 where any potential
Higgs mixing angle and group theory factor CN has been
factored out of the W HH vertex in Eq. (1). This can also
be considered as an assumption of ‘alignment’ between
the gauge and mass eigenstates and setting CN = 1,
or the large tan β plus fermiophobic limit [11] in two
Higgs doublet models. We assume the fermiophobic con-
dition is maintained at loop level by either an appro-
priate renormalization condition [8, 9] or global symme-
try [15, 34, 41, 43]. Furthermore, we assume that H 0
F can-
not decay to any exotic states and, for all results shown
in this section, we take |λW Z| = 1.
We emphasize that this pp → W ±
F pair
production mechanism had not been considered in Higgs
searches until a very recent CDF analysis [56] of Tevatron
data in the 4γ + X channel. Here we examine its utility
to search for fermiophobic Higgs bosons at the 8 TeV
LHC in the diphoton 2, ZZ, and W W channels. These
are the ﬁrst searches to constrain a fermiophobic Higgs

fermiophobic Higgs bosons.

FIG. 4. Branching ratios for H 0

where for all curves we have set |λW Z| = 1 (see Eq. (4)). For
the solid curves we have assumed the couplings to γγ and

dashed curves we have taken the eﬀective couplings to γγ and
Zγ as free paramaters and set λγγ = λZγ = 0.05 (see Eq. (6)).

case has been considered previously in [4, 5], but did
not explicitly include the virtual photon contribution in
F → V ∗γ → 2f γ (purple curves) which is dominated
H 0
by the γ∗γ component at low masses and can be as large
as O(20%). While the size of this contribution depends
on experimental phase space cuts, as emphasized in [69–
75], virtual diphoton eﬀects can provide valuable infor-
mation in scalar decays. Note there is also the two body
H 0
F → Zγ decay, but it is less than 1% over this mass
range. We also emphasize that in this case all of the
H → V V decay amplitudes depend linearly on the ex-
otic Higgs vev (or sθ) and thus the branching fractions
will be independent of the vev. As we will discuss below,
in some cases this vev independence of the branching ra-
tios can be utilized, along with the Higgs pair production
mechanism, to obtain constraints on fermiophobic scalars
which are independent of the vev.

In the second scenario (dashed curves) we consider
the possibility of constructive interference eﬀects gen-
erating large eﬀective coupling to γγ and Zγ by tak-
ing λV γ = λγγ = λZγ = 0.05. This is to be compared
to λV γ ∼ 0.005 − 0.01 from only the W loop contribu-
tion which depends on the mass of H 0
F . We see that in
this case of enhanced couplings to photons the diphoton
channel can be sizable all the way up to the W W thresh-
old. Furthermore we see the H 0
F → V γ → 2f γ three body
decay through an oﬀ-shell photon or Z can also be siz-
able for masses up to ∼ 130 GeV and may be interesting
to study further.
Depending on how these large eﬀective couplings are
generated, there may be a dependence on the exotic Higgs
vev introduced into the branching ratios. However, even
in this case the branching ratios are still largely indepen-
dent of the vev since over much of the mass range either
the γγ (and γ∗γ) decay dominates, or W W and ZZ de-

become highly suppressed.

A. Diphoton Probes for Light Masses

We ﬁrst consider the possibility of probing fermio-
phobic Higgs bosons with diphoton searches at 8 TeV
LHC. We show in Fig. 5 the production cross section
times branching ratio into diphotons (blue curves) as
a function of H 0

We ﬁrst note that for the case of H 0

N production,
assuming degenerate masses and dominant W boson loop
(solid thick blue curve), fermiophobic Higgs masses be-
low around ∼ 115 GeV can be ruled out. Again for
comparison we show the same production channel at 13
TeV (light blue solid curve) where we see masses up
to ∼ 125 GeV could be probed and perhaps ruled out
once 13 TeV diphoton data becomes available. For a
speciﬁc model this bound may be higher or lower de-
pending on the group theory factor CN entering the
coeﬃcient in Eq. (1) and assuming small Higgs mass
mixing eﬀects, but this generally will not drastically
change the bound as we will see below for custodial Higgs
triplet models. We emphasize that the recent CDF anal-
ysis [56] of multiphoton Tevatron data is insensitive to

6

this degenerate case. For the case of a 100 GeV split-
ting (blue dotted curve) between the neutral and charged
scalars (MH± > MH 0) the limit at 8 TeV is reduced to
∼ 100 GeV 3. While we have not shown a case where
MH± < MH 0, clearly diphoton searches can also be ap-
plied in this case.

Again we consider the possibility of constructive in-
terference eﬀects generating enhanced (by an order of
magnitude) eﬀective coupling to γγ and Zγ by taking
λV γ = 0.05 (blue dashed curve). We see that in this case
the diphoton channel can potentially rule out fermiopho-
bic Higgs boson masses all the way up to around the W W
threshold. We also consider the case where interference
eﬀects conspire to cancel giving small eﬀective V γ cou-
plings by taking λV γ = 10−3 (blue dot dashed curve). In
this case the limits are noticeably reduced, but neverthe-
less masses below ∼ 90 GeV can still be ruled out. We
also see for the VBF production mode that if values of
sθ ≈ 1 were still allowed by measurements of the 125 GeV
Higgs boson, they would be ruled out by this diphoton
search for masses below ∼ 140 GeV. Once sθ is con-
strained to be (cid:46) 0.4, the VBF production mode becomes
less sensitive than the Higgs pair production mode and
totally irrelevant for sθ (cid:46) 0.1.

We also emphasize the importance of extending dipho-
ton searches below 65 GeV since masses in this range
are not ruled out by Tevatron searches for small mass
splittings between the Higgs pair. There are in principle
limits on the charged Higgs boson from LEP which ap-
ply, but these can be evaded if the charge Higgs is also
fermiophobic. Depending on how the charged Higgs de-
cays there may still be relevant constraints, but a detailed
investigation is beyond the scope of this work.

Generally speaking there are a few ways to evade
the limits discussed here. The ﬁrst is to introduce large
amounts of Higgs mass mixing via multiple neutral CP
even scalars. Since mass mixing with the SM-like Higgs
at 125 GeV is constrained to be small [51], the mixing
must be among exotic scalars to give large eﬀects and
qualitatively aﬀect our results. In some models, this mass
mixing is forbidden by global symmetries as for example
in custodial Higgs triplet models to be discussed more be-
low. An additional way to evade these limits is to engineer
for even more precise cancellations among the contribu-
tions to the H 0
F γγ eﬀective coupling leading to even more
suppressed values than 10−3 for λV γ. Finally, if there is
no additional charged or neutral Higgs light enough to
be appreciably pair produced along with H 0
F then pro-
duction cross sections become highly suppressed making
H 0
F diﬃcult to observe. Possibilities to obtain very robust
bounds and test extreme regions of parameter space in
fermiophobic Higgs models at a 100 TeV collider would
also be interesting to consider.

We now consider the possibility of combining the p¯p →

H 0
N production mechanism with W W and ZZ de-
cays in order to study fermiophobic Higgs bosons at the
LHC. We show in Fig. 6 the production cross section
times branching ratio into W W (top) and ZZ (bottom)
as a function of the H 0
F mass for the various fermiopho-
bic Higgs scenarios discussed in Fig. 5. The 95% exclu-
sion limits (black dashed) from 7 + 8 TeV W W and ZZ
searches at CMS [77] are also shown for each channel. We
see that limits from 7 + 8 TeV W W and ZZ searches are
not quite sensitive to these fermiophobic Higgs scenar-
ios. However, if 13 TeV data can improve upon current
limits by roughly an order of magnitude these channels
should become promising probes of fermiophobic Higgs
bosons with masses above where diphoton searches are
sensitive and potentially up to ∼ 250 GeV.

FIG. 6. Same as Fig. 5, but for WW (top) and ZZ (bottom)
decay channels. The 95% exclusion limits (black dashed) from
7 + 8 TeV W W and ZZ searches at CMS [77] are also shown.

Furthermore, we emphasize that these W W and ZZ
searches should be extended to lower masses below
the V V threshold, where cross sections can be larger
and where there are currently no relevant W W or ZZ
searches for a fermiophobic Higgs with a small vev. In
particular, by extending these searches to lower masses,

7

we have an additional probe which may allow us to un-
cover light fermiophobic Higgs bosons with suppressed
couplings to photons (dot-dashed curves) where dipho-
ton searches lose sensitivity. On the other hand if the
couplings to photons are enhanced these W W and ZZ
searches become less sensitive. We also note that a dedi-
cated analysis of masses around the 125 GeV Higgs could
be particularly interesting as this region has been ne-
glected in terms of exotic Higgs searches since the dis-
covery of the SM-like Higgs boson. Furthermore, in this
region all decay channels are potentially sensitive.

IV. CLOSING THE ‘FIVEPLET WINDOW’

As an explicit example of a fermiophobic scalar sec-
tor which contributes to EWSB, we consider custo-
dial Higgs triplet models, which consist of the SM (or
MSSM) Higgs sector plus three custodial electroweak
triplet scalars. There are a number of variations of custo-
dial Higgs triplet models, both non-supersymmetric [34–
42] and supersymmetric [43–46], but their diﬀerences are
not relevant for our current study. The crucial feature
that all of them share, in addition to being easily made
to satisfy constraints from electroweak precision data, is
that after EWSB the Higgs triplets decompose into repre-
sentations of the custodial SU (2)C global symmetry. In
particular, all custodial Higgs triplet models contain a
fermiophobic scalar (H5) transforming as a ﬁveplet un-
der the custodial symmetry and which has a CP even
neutral (H 0
) charged
components with degenerate masses.

5 ), and doubly (H±±

5 ), singly (H±

5

5 H±

Custodial symmetry also prevents the neutral compo-
nent from mixing with other neutral scalars and in partic-
ular with the 125 GeV SM Higgs boson, allowing for the
fermiophobic condition to be maintained 4 without ﬁne
tuning [34, 41, 43], in contrast to two Higgs doublet mod-
els [15]. Thus no mixing angles enter in Eq. (1) for the
W ∓H 0
5 vertex while the group theory factor is ﬁxed in
all custodial Higgs triplet models to be CN = √3/2, as is
the ratio of W W and ZZ couplings [66] at |λW Z| = 1/2
(see Eq. (4)). We also emphasize that there is no de-
5 H±
pendence on the Higgs triplet vev [41] in the W ∓H 0
5
vertex [15, 34, 41, 43]. Combined with the largely vev
independent branching ratios, this allows us for the ﬁrst
time to use diphoton and diboson searches at the LHC to
put robust limits on custodial ﬁveplet scalars which are
independent of the Higgs triplet vev.

4 Due to hypercharge interactions, custodial breaking eﬀects are
introduced at one loop which can spoil the fermiophobic and
degenerate mass conditions for the custodial ﬁveplet. But these
eﬀects are naturally small [37, 44] allowing for these conditions
to be maintained to a good approximation.

5 H 0
5 production cross sections are calculated using the
Madgraph/GM model implementation from [58, 59]. The
branching ratios are obtained from the partial widths into
γγ, V ∗γ (V = Z, γ), W W , and ZZ which are computed
for the mass range 45 − 250 GeV. They have a similar
behavior as those in Fig. 4 except that at high mass ZZ
dominates due to the fact that λW Z = 1/2 [78]. The rele-
vant three and four body decays are obtained by integra-
tion of the analytic expressions for the H 0
5 → V γ → 2(cid:96)γ
and H 0
5 → V V → 4(cid:96) fully diﬀerential decay widths com-
puted in [69–71]. We note that these branching ratios
include the γ∗γ contribution which, as shown in Fig. 4,
can be sizeable at low masses.

We focus on the regime where the eﬀective couplings of
the ﬁveplet to γγ and Zγ are dominated by the W loop
contribution shown in Fig. 3. The eﬀects of the charged
scalar sector could in principle be large [55] leading to
enhanced or suppressed eﬀective couplings to photons. As
discussed above, and shown in Fig. 5, this can aﬀect the
upper limit of masses which can be ruled out and could
in principle allow for masses up to the W W threshold to
be ruled out by diphoton searches. Since these eﬀects are
more model dependent we do not consider them here.

We see in Fig. 7 that by exploiting the H 0

5 Higgs
pair production mechanism, custodial ﬁveplet scalars
with masses (cid:46) 107 GeV can be ruled out by 8 TeV dipho-
ton searches, independently of the Higgs triplet vev. We
ﬁnd similar limits as those found in Fig. 5 for the same

5 H±

8

values of suppressed and enhanced couplings to pho-
tons. These are the ﬁrst such limits on custodial ﬁveplet
scalars and in particular, since the charged and neutral
components are degenerate, limits from Tevatron 4γ + X
searches [56] do not apply. This is because for cases like
the custodial ﬁveplet where the masses are degenerate,
the H±
5 W ± decay is not available. In this case the
5 → H 0
one loop H±
5 → W ±γ decay can become dominant lead-
ing instead to a 3γ + W signal. Examining this decay as
well should improve the sensitivity relative to diphoton
searches.

To emphasize the utility of the DY pair production
mechanism, we also show (gray shaded region) the cross
section times branching ratio assuming the VBF pro-
duction mechanism. Since for a ﬁveplet we have instead
λW Z = 1/2 for the ratio of W W and ZZ couplings
(see Eq. (4)), one cannot simply rescale the SM cross
section for which λW Z = 1. We therefore have again
used [58, 59] to obtain these results for 8 TeV LHC. We
have ﬁxed sθ = 0.4 for the doublet-triplet vev mixing an-
gle as deﬁned in [59] and schematically in Eq. (2). The
value sθ = 0.4 is towards the upper limit of values still
allowed by electroweak precision and 125 GeV Higgs
data [79, 80], but we can see in Fig. 7 this already renders
diphoton searches for custodial ﬁveplet scalars based on
VBF (and similarly for VH) production irrelevant.

We also emphasize that ruling out a custodial ﬁveplet
below ∼ 110 GeV independently of the vev allows us to
unambiguously close the ﬁveplet ‘window’ at masses be-
low ∼ 100 GeV [42] which is still allowed by electroweak
precisions data [81] and essentially unconstrained by
other LEP, Tevatron, and LHC direct searches. Thus we
are able to rule out an interesting region of parameter
space of custodial Higgs triplet models which would oth-
erwise be diﬃcult to constrain directly. We estimate 13
TeV diphoton searches will be sensitive to scalar masses
up to ∼ 125 GeV in the regime of dominant W boson
loop, though NLO Higgs pair production eﬀects [65] may
allow this to be extended further. The diphoton search
discussed here may of course be useful for other scalars
which are found in custodial Higgs triplet models, but we
do not explore this here.

Finally, we also see in Fig. 7 that W W and ZZ searches
may be useful for probing custodial ﬁveplet scalars inde-
pendently of the Higgs triplet vev as well. Though 8 TeV
searches are not quite sensitive, larger Higgs pair produc-
tion cross sections at 13 TeV (see Fig. 1) should allow for
ﬁveplet masses well above diphoton limits to be probed
and possibly as high as ∼ 250 GeV. In particular, the ZZ
channel should become sensitive with early 13 TeV data
for masses around the ZZ threshold. These also serves as
a useful compliment to W +W + searches for the doubly
charged component of the custodial ﬁveplet [82].

In this study we have explored diphoton and diboson
searches at the LHC as probes of exotic fermiophobic
Higgs bosons which are pair produced with an additional
Higgs boson. We have focused on the pp → W ±
→
H±
N H 0
F production channel which is present in all exten-
sions of the SM Higgs sector and generally the dominant
DY Higgs pair production mechanism. We have empha-
sized that this production mechanism does not vanish in
the limit of small exotic Higgs vacuum expectation value,
unlike vector boson fusion and associated vector boson
production. Since measurements of the SM-like 125 GeV
Higgs boson imply small exotic Higgs vacuum expec-
tation values, previous searches for fermiophobic Higgs
bosons which assumed vector boson fusion and associ-
ated vector boson production are now obsolete.

We have shown that by combining the Higgs pair
production mechanism with diphoton searches, one can
put stringent and rather generic bounds on fermiopho-
bic Higgs bosons already with 8 TeV LHC diphoton
data. These limits are stronger and more general than
those obtained in a very recent CDF 4γ + X search [56]
which are currently the only other relevant direct con-
straints on a fermiophobic Higgs boson in the small vev
limit. In particular, we ﬁnd that while Tevatron diphoton
searches are not sensitive to fermiophobic Higgs bosons,
the larger Higgs pair production cross sections at 8 TeV
LHC allow us to already generically rule out a neutral
fermiophobic Higgs boson below ∼ 110 GeV for degen-
erate masses and under the assumption that the cou-
plings to photons are generated dominantly by a W bo-
son loop. We have also emphasized that this degenerate
mass scenario is not ruled out by Tevatron data.

If there is a mass splitting as large as ∼ 100 GeV,
we ﬁnd masses below ∼ 100 GeV can be excluded. Fur-
thermore, we ﬁnd that if the couplings to photons are
enhanced, masses up to ∼ 150 GeV can be ruled out,
while if cancellations conspire to give very small eﬀective
coupling to photons, fermiophobic Higgs scalars below
∼ 90 GeV can still be ruled out by diphoton searches at
8 TeV. This makes diphoton searches a robust and sen-
sitive probe of lighter fermiophobic scalars. Of course a
dedicated multiphoton search at the LHC including the
charged Higgs decay, as done at Tevatron, should im-
prove limits further and is an important complementary
probe. We have also combined the H±
F Higgs pair pro-
duction channel with W W and ZZ diboson searches to
probe fermiophobic Higgs masses up to ∼ 250 GeV. We
ﬁnd that while 8 TeV searches are not yet sensitive, the
prospects for 13 TeV LHC are very promising if current

limits can be improved by about an order of magnitude
with future data. The inclusion of NLO Higgs pair pro-
duction eﬀects may also further improve the limits dis-
cussed in this study.

Finally, we have examined the particular case of a cus-
todial ﬁveplet scalar found in all incarnations of custodial
Higgs triplet models [34, 41, 43] in which the neutral and
charged component are predicted to be degenerate. Thus
the CDF 4γ + X search [56] cannot be applied to this
case. We have shown for the ﬁrst time that a custodial
ﬁveplet scalar below ∼ 110 GeV is ruled out by 8 TeV
diphoton searches and possibly up to higher masses if
charged scalar loops produce large constructive contri-
butions to the eﬀective photon couplings. These limits
are also largely independent of the Higgs triplet vev and
so robustly close the ‘ﬁveplet window’ at masses below
∼ 110 GeV [42], still allowed by electroweak precision
and 125 GeV Higgs boson data. We also ﬁnd that diboson
searches, and in particular ZZ searches, may be useful for
larger ﬁveplet masses, allowing us to potentially obtain
limits again independently of the Higgs triplet vev.

→ H±

To summarize, by combining the pp → W ±

N H 0
F
Higgs pair production mechanism with H 0
F → V V dipho-
ton and diboson decays, one obtains a powerful probe at
the LHC of fermiophobic Higgs bosons for masses up to
∼ 250 GeV. These searches are sensitive even in the limit
of vanishing exotic Higgs vev and open a yet to be ex-
plored avenue to search for fermiophobic Higgs bosons at
the LHC in both current and future data.
