Introduction

Systems of massless higher spin ﬁelds which are transformed under a reducible representation of
the Lorentz group have attracted a great deal of attention (see e.g. [1–21]), since, as was shown
30 years ago [1,2], they arise in a tensionless limit of string theory in a ﬂat background and may,
therefore, shed light on a possible relation between string theory and higher spin gauge theory.
The simplest of these systems consists of three symmetric tensor ﬁelds of rank s, s− 1 and s− 2.
This motivated Francia and Sagnotti [5] to call them higher-spin triplets. The simplest massless
bosonic triplets form reducible multiplets of physical ﬁelds with even or odd spins (or helicities)
running, respectively, from 0 or 1 to s, while the fermionic triplets consist of physical ﬁelds with
half-integer spins running from 1/2 to s 1. More complicated systems involve tensor ﬁelds of
mixed symmetry. Since 1986 higher-spin triplets have been studied from diﬀerent perspectives
(see e.g. [1–25]). For a review and references on diﬀerence aspects of higher spin theory see
e.g. [11, 26–36]).

Fermionic triplets of tensor-spinor ﬁelds were introduced in [22] and independently in [5].
Their origin from a tensionless limit of a Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz string was studied in detail
in [6]. The Lagrangian formulations (i.e. the actions and equations of motion) for bosonic triplets
are known in ﬂat and anti de Sitter spaces, both in metric-like and frame-like formulations of the
higher spin ﬁelds. For the fermionic triples, however, the metric-like actions and equations of
motion have been constructed only in ﬂat space-time, while the generalization of this construction
to the anti-de Sitter spaces encountered obstacles [6, 9] and have not been fulﬁlled by now. On
the other hand, in the frame-like formalism the Lagrangian description of reducible fermionic
higher-spin systems in AdS was constructed in [12] and it was outlined therein that the metric-
like Lagrangian formulation of the fermionic triplets in AdS can be obtained from the frame-like
one by a certain redeﬁnition of ﬁelds.

The purpose of this note is to accomplish this goal and to derive an explicit form of the
metric-like action, equations of motion and local symmetries of the fermionic triplets in AdS
from their frame-like counterparts.
In passing we will clarify a subtlety regarding a physical
spin-1/2 ﬁeld one should deal with when relating the reducible fermionic frame-like higher-spin
system to the metric-like fermionic triplet. A motivation for presenting these results is that
having got the gauge invariant metric-like Lagrangian formulation of the fermionic (and bosonic)
higher-spin triplets in AdS one can perform its BRST analysis (already carried out in the bosonic
case in [6]) with the aim of understanding whether and how these systems may be obtained by
taking a tensionless limit of a String Theory in an AdS background.

Our main notation and conventions are given in the Appendix.

2 Fermionic triplets in ﬂat space-time

2.1 Metric-like formulation

In the metric-like formulation in D-dimensional space-time a fermionic higher-spin triplet consists
of three symmetric tensor-spinor ﬁelds Ψµ1...µr
, where µi = 0, 1, . . . , D−1
1The conventional notion of spin and helicity are associated with irreducible representations of the four-
dimensional Poincar´e group.
In what follows we will formally use this terminology also in higher-dimensional
theories associating the “spin” with the rank of symmetric tensor-spinors which transform under irreducible rep-
resentations of the SO(1, D − 1) Lorentz group.

with s denoting the highest spin in the spectrum of the triplet ﬁelds. In ﬂat space-time they
satisfy the following equations of motion [5]

✓∂Ψµ1...µr + i∂(µ1 χµ2...µr) = 0,
∂ν Ψνµ1...µr−1 − ∂(µ1 λµ2...µr−1) + i✓∂χµ1...µr−1 = 0,
✓∂λµ1...µr−2 + i∂ν χνµ1...µr−2 = 0 ,

which are invariant under the gauge transformations

δΨµ1...µr = ∂(µ1 Λµ2...µr),
δχµ1...µr−1 = i✓∂Λµ1...µr−1,
δλµ1...µr−2 = ∂ν Λνµ1...µr−2.

(2.1)

The ﬁeld equations (2.1) follow from the ﬂat-space action which we present in the form similar
to that given in [5]

where, for brevity, the collective index µ(k) stands for k symmetrized indices µ1 . . . µk.

The construction of the metric-like Lagrangian formulation of fermionic higher-spin triplets
in AdS spaces, however, encountered diﬃculties [6,9] and has not been accomplished by now. In
what follows we will show how this puzzle is resolved by deriving the metric-like action for the
fermionic higher-spin triplets in AdS from their frame-like Lagrangian formulation.

2.2 Frame-like formulation

In the frame-like formulation [12] the fermionic triplet is associated with a 1-form that takes
values in the space of symmetric tensor-spinors:

ψa1...ar−1

α

= dxµψa1...ar−1

α µ

.

This form is not subject to any gamma-trace conditions2.

In ﬂat space the gauge transformation of ψa1...ar−1 has the following form

δψa1...ar−1 = dξa1...ar−1 − dxbξa1...ar−1,b,

(2.4)

where the tensor-spinor gauge parameters ξa1...ar−1 and ξa1...ar−1,b are zero forms that remove
from ψa1...ar−1
the unphysical degrees of freedom. The second parameter is associated with a

group of a spin s = r + 1

. The connection ﬁeld is auxiliary and expressed (modulo the

via the torsion-like constraint

T a1...ar−1 = dψa1...ar−1 − dxc ∧ ψa1...ar−1,b = 0,

The torsion is invariant under the gauge transformations (2.4) and that of ψa1...ar−1,b

δψa1...ar−1,b = dξa1...ar−1,b − dxcξa1...ar−1,bc.

(2.5)

(2.6)

For the consistency of the construction (see Section 2.3), while the higher-spin vielbein is uncon-
strained, the connection ψa1...ar−1,b and the gauge parameters ξa1...ar−1,b and ξa1...ar−1,bc should
satisfy the following (gamma-)trace constraints

γbψa1...ar−1,b = 0,
γbξa1...ar−1,b = 0,
γbξa1...ar−1,bc = 0,

ηbcψa1...ar−2b,c = 0,
ηbcξa1...ar−2b,c = 0,
ηdbξa1...ar−2d,bc = 0.

(2.7)

The metric-like triplet ﬁelds Ψ, χ and λ introduced in Section 2.1 are related to ψa1...ar−1

(2.9)

where we introduced “hatted” quantities which diﬀer from Ψ, χ and λ by a total trace, as we
will explain now3.

The splitting (2.9) manifests the fact that the representation in which ψa1...ar−1 sits is not
irreducible, as it may have γa- and ηab-traces. As a result, this ﬁeld contains physical states
with spins going down from s = r + 1
2 to 3/2, while its spin 1/2 state is a pure gauge. This is
due to the fact that the three ﬁelds (2.9), being all derived from ψa1...ar−1
, are not completely
independent. Indeed, let us deﬁne the complete trace ˜T of a tensor-spinor Ta1...ar as

µ

˜T =(ηa1a2 · · · ηar−1ar

Ta1...ar
ηa1a2 · · · ηar−2ar−1iγar

if r is even
if r is odd.

Then, in the metric-like description, the equations of motion imply that for s = r + 1


✓∂(cid:16) ˜Ψ − r˜λ(cid:17) = 0
✓∂(cid:16) ˜Ψ − ˜χ − (r − 1)˜λ(cid:17) = 0 if r is odd .


Their form allows us to identify the spin 1

ρ ≡( ˜Ψ − r˜λ

˜Ψ − ˜χ − (r − 1)˜λ

if r is even
if r is odd.

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

In the frame-like formulation, by virtue of (2.9), we ﬁnd that ρ ≡ 0 .

3The imaginary unit factor i in the deﬁnition of ˆχ is introduced because in our conventions when D = 4 the

gamma-matrices are purely imaginary in the Majorana representation.

3

This analysis tells us that the triplet ﬁelds (2.9) obtained from ψa1...ar−1

are not quite the
same as those appearing in the equations (2.1): their complete traces do not match. Of course,
we can ﬁx this issue by simply adding a spin- 1
2 massless ﬁeld ρ to the frame-like action of the
theory, which we will introduce in the next section. Then the original metric-like triplet ﬁelds
Ψ, χ and λ are related to the ﬁelds (2.9) as follows

µ

and

Ψa1...ar ≡ ˆΨa1...ar + η(a1a2· · ·ηar−1ar)ρ ,
λa1...ar−2 ≡ ˆλa1...ar−2 + η(a1a2· · ·ηar−3ar−2)ρ

for r even

(2.13)

Ψa1...ar ≡ ˆΨa1...ar − iη(a1a2· · ·ηar−2ar−1γar)ρ
λa1...ar−2 ≡ ˆλa1...ar−2 − iη(a1 a2· · ·ηar−4ar−3γar−2)ρ ,
χa1...ar−1 ≡ ˆχa1...ar−1 + 2η(a1 a2· · ·ηar−2ar−1)ρ for r odd.

(2.14)

2.3 Frame-like action for fermionic triplets in ﬂat space

The frame-like action that reproduces, upon making the identiﬁcations (2.9), (2.13) and (2.14),
the equations (2.1) can be found by an ansatz motivated by some simple requirements. It should
be gauge-invariant under (2.6) and have a schematic form of a free fermion action i ¯ψγ∂ψ, where γ
stays for a product of gamma-matrices and ¯ψ is the Dirac conjugate of ψ. Therefore, to construct
the action we use the gauge invariant higher-spin torsion 2-form

T a1...ar−1 ≡ dψa1...ar−1 − dxb ∧ ψa1...ar−1,b,

(2.15)

which is considered to be non-zero oﬀ the mass shell (compare with (2.5)). Then, terms like
i ¯ψγ ∧ T are gauge invariant under the transformations of ψ but not ¯ψ. The most general
Lorentz-invariant action constructed using such 3-forms is [12]

ST = iZ dxa1 ∧ · · · ∧ dxaD−3 ∧ εa1...aD−3cdf(cid:16) ¯ψb1...br−1 ∧ γcdfTb1...br−1
+c ¯ψb1...br−2c ∧ γdT f

(2.16)

b1...br−2(cid:17) ,

where εa1...aD is the D-dimensional completely antisymmetric Levi-Civita tensor and c is an
arbitrary constat.

This action has three issues to tackle. It is not invariant under the gauge transformations of
¯ψ, it is not real and contains the auxiliary ﬁeld ψa1...ar−1,b, that should be completely determined
by ψa1...ar−1 through (2.5). These three issues are ﬁxed by choosing a proper c. Indeed, it is
possible to show that for c = −6(r − 1) and if ψa1...ar−1,b is constrained as in (2.7), all the terms
proportional to this auxiliary ﬁeld disappear. Then (2.16) becomes simply

S = iZ dxa1 ∧ · · · ∧ dxaD−3 ∧ εa1...aD−3cdf(cid:16) ¯ψb1...br−1 ∧ γcdf dψb1...br−1
−6(r − 1) ¯ψb1...br−2c ∧ γddψf

(2.17)

b1...br−2(cid:17) .

Integrating (2.17) by parts we can turn it (modulo total derivatives) into its complex conjugate,
so (2.17) satisﬁes the reality condition. Moreover, due to our choice of c, in the Hermitian

4

conjugate version of (2.17) we can restore the (vanishing) terms proportional to ¯ψa1...ar−1,b and
rewrite the action as

S ¯T = iZ dxa1 ∧ · · · ∧ dxaD−3 ∧ εa1...aD−3cdf(cid:16) ¯T b1...br−1 ∧ γcdf ψb1...br−1
−6(r − 1) ¯T b1...br−2c ∧ γdψf

b1...br−2(cid:17) ,

which is therefore equivalent to (2.16) up to total derivatives. The variation of (2.17) under
gauge transformations can be then schematically rewritten as

δS =

δST
δψ

δψ + δ ¯ψ

δS ¯T
δ ¯ψ

= 0.

It vanishes because of the manifest gauge invariance of T a1...ar−1 and ¯T a1...ar−1 and provided that
the gauge parameters ξa1...ar−1,b satisfy the constraints (2.8).
One can show [12] that the equations of motion derived from the frame-like action (2.17) are
equivalent to the metric-like ones (2.1) modulo the subtlety with the spin- 1
2 ﬁeld ρ, which can
be included into the frame-like formulation by simply adding to the action the massless Dirac
Lagrangian L 1

= i¯ργm∂mρ.

3 Fermionic higher-spin triplets in anti-de-Sitter spaces

3.1 The frame-like formalism in AdS

The frame-like description of the ﬁeld ψa1...ar−1 can be generalized to the anti-de-Sitter space by
employing a proper AdS covariant derivative in place of the ﬂat-space derivative and by using a
local basis for the AdS tangent space given by the vielbein ea = dxm ea
m(x). Actually, to construct
the covariant derivatives we will employ two kinds of connections. The one associated with the
invariance under SO(1, D − 1) local Lorentz transformations and containing the spin–connection
1–form ωab = −ωba will be denoted by

∇T a = dT a + ωa

b ∧ T b

(3.1)

and will act on the D-dimensional vectorial tangent-space indices. For the spinorial indices
one can also use the connection associated to the whole symmetry group of AdSD, namely
the isometry group SO(2, D − 1), which includes, in addition to the Lorentz transformations
generated by J ab, the non-commuting translations generated by P a:

where Λ is a negative cosmological constant which deﬁnes the AdS curvature

hP a, P bi = ΛJ ab,

Rab = dωab + ωac ∧ ωc

b = −Λea ∧ eb .

We denote this covariant derivative by

Dψα = dψα +

ωab (J ab) β

α ∧ ψβ + eb (Pb) β

α ∧ ψβ ,

where in the spinorial representation

J ab =

−Λγa.

Note that, in view of (3.2), when acting on the spinors the product of the two external diﬀerentials
D vanishes (3.3)

(3.4)
When dealing with tensor-spinors we will assume that D acts as a covariant diﬀerential on
vector indices and as (3.3) on spinorial ones. In particular, the matrices γa are annihilated by ∇
but not by D

In view of (3.2) and (3.4), the following identity holds for the symmetric tensor-spinors

D2ψa1...ar = ∇2ψa1...ar = −Λe(a1 ∧ eb ∧ ψa2...ar)b .

The AdS counterpart of the fermionic higher-spin torsion (2.15) is deﬁned as follows

T a1...ar−1 ≡ Dψa1...ar−1 − eb ∧ ψa1...ar−1,b.

(3.6)

(3.7)

In virtue of (3.6), it is gauge invariant under the following AdS-deformation of the gauge trans-
formations (2.6)

(3.5)

(3.8)

δψa1 ...ar−1 = Dξa1...ar−1 − ebξa1...ar−1,b ,
δψa1...ar−1,b = Dξa1...ar−1,b − ecξa1...ar−1,bc

+Λ(cid:16)e(ar−1 ξa1...ar−2)b − (r − 1)ebξa1...ar−1(cid:17) ,

which coincide with (2.6) in the ﬂat limit Λ → 0.
In ﬂat space, for consistency, we required the gauge parameters to satisfy the constraints
(2.8), which guarantee that the γ-trace of the higher-spin vielbein of rank r = s − 1
2 transforms
under the gauge transformations in the same way as a higher-spin vielbein of rank r = s − 3
2 . In
the AdS space, in view of (3.5), the same requirement leads to the following constraints on the
gauge parameters

where

δ(cid:16)γbψa1...ar−2b(cid:17) = DΞa1...ar−2 − ecΞa1...ar−2,c .

Ξa1...ar−2 ≡ γbξa1...ar−2b, Ξa1...ar−2,c ≡ −i√

−Λγc

bξa1...ar−2b + γbξa1...ar−2b,c.

The symmetrization properties of the parameter Ξa1...ar−2,c impose the following constraint on
ξa1...ar−1,b which is the AdS generalization of (2.8)

γbξa1...ar−1,b = −i√

Correspondingly, one imposes the analogous constraint on the auxiliary higher-spin connection

γbψa1...ar−1,b = −i√

−Λγ(a1

b ψa2...ar−2)b.

(3.9)

The relations involving contractions with the metric ηab in (2.7) and (2.8) do not change.

3.2 The frame-like action in AdS

We construct the frame-like action for the reducible higher-spin fermionic ﬁeld ψa1...ar−1 in the
anti-de Sitter space in the same way as in ﬂat space, i.e. with the use of the higher-spin torsion
(3.7) and ﬁx the coeﬃcient by requiring that the action reduces to (2.16) in the Λ → 0 limit. We
thus get

SAdS = iZ ea1 ∧ · · · ∧ eaD−3 ∧ εa1...aD−3cdf(cid:16) ¯ψb1...br−1 ∧ γcdfTb1...br−1

(3.10)

b1...br−2(cid:17) .

This time the terms in this action containing the independent components of the auxiliary ﬁeld
ψa1...ar−1,b cancel each other due to the deformed constraint (3.9). So, in comparison with (2.17)
the action (3.10) contains more terms than in the ﬂat space, namely

(3.11)

where to simplify the appearance of the above expression we have skipped the wedge products
of the diﬀerential forms. In the form (3.11) the AdS action was constructed in [12] by a “brute
force”, i.e. without the help of the gauge-invariant higher-spin torsion (3.7).

The total gauge invariance and reality of (3.10) (and therefore of (3.11)) is proven in the
same way as in Section 2.3 by showing that the action is equivalent (modulo total derivatives)
to the action constructed with the use of the Dirac conjugate torsion ¯T a1...ar−1.

counterpart by replacing in the former the higher-spin vielbein ψa1...ar−1
with the fermionic
higher-spin triplet ﬁelds deﬁned in (2.9), (2.13) and (2.14). This is achieved by ﬁrst passing from
the diﬀerential form expression for the action (3.11) to its component form in terms of ψa1...ar−1
and then regrouping various terms with γa and ηab contractions. Somewhat tedious but direct

By taking linear combinations of the equations (3.16) we get the disentangled conventional equa-
tions of motion for the gauge-invariant dynamical spin-1/2 ﬁeld ρ = χ−iγaΨa and the dynamical
spin-3/2 ﬁeld ψa = Ψa − i

These equations are also invariant under the gauge transformations (3.17) but, as one can see,
they diﬀer from (3.16). As was shown in [6], the consistency of (3.19) requires that

χ = iγaΨa,

which means that the system (3.19) does not contain the physical spin-1/2 ﬁeld, the issue which
is solved by the properly modiﬁed equations (3.16).

4 Conclusion and outlook

As was shown in [12], in the frame-like formulation, the triplet ﬁelds are endowed with a geo-
metrical meaning of higher-spin vielbeins and connections transforming under higher-spin local
symmetries. This allows one to determine in a conventional way gauge-invariant higher-spin
torsion and curvatures and use them for the construction of simply-looking frame-like actions for
these systems both in ﬂat and AdS spaces.

(3.18)

Starting from the frame-like action for the unconstrained fermionic higher-spin vielbein and
the spin-1/2 ﬁeld in AdS space, and using the splitting of this vielbein into the metric-like triplet
of fermionic ﬁelds, we have resolved a long-standing issue of the construction of the metric-like
Lagrangian description of the fermionic triplets in AdS spaces.

Having now at our disposal the metric-like Lagrangian formulation for bosonic and fermionic
triplets in AdS, one can analyze the BRST structure associated with their gauge transformations
and equations of motion, and use the obtained form of the BRST charge for studying whether
and how the triplets in AdS may arise from the quantization of strings in AdS in a tensionless
limit. Since in AdS one may play with two parameters, the string tension and the AdS radius,
the tensionless limit of AdS strings may avoid singularities of its ﬂat space counterpart. In this
respect it will be interesting to revise the procedure and results of taking a tensionless limit of a
bosonic AdS string considered in [40].

As another direction of research, one can proceed with studying interactions of higher-spin
triplet ﬁelds (cubic and quartic vertices, current exchanges, etc.) along lines put forward in
[11, 13, 25]. One of the advantages here is that reducibility of triplet systems can make things
simpler, since a single triplet vertex contains a number of vertices of irreducible higher-spin ﬁelds.
Finally, one may study whether the minimal Vasiliev theory [41], describing interacting ﬁelds
of the even spins from 0 to inﬁnity (which can be viewed as a single higher-spin “triplet” with
s = ∞), could be extended to an interacting theory of inﬁnite sets of “triplets”, as might happen
in string theory. To this end one will need to generalize the unfolded machinery to deal with
weak trace and gamma-trace conditions (like in (2.7) and (2.8)). First steps in this direction
were made in [12].

Appendix. Notation and conventions

The signature of the D-dimensional space-time metric is chosen to be almost minus (+,−, . . . ,−).
The Greek letters µ, ν, ... denote world indices associated with space-time coordinates xµ. The
Latin letters a, b, c... label the components of tangent-space tensors. The world indices are
converted into the tangent space ones by means of the vielbein ea
µ(x), which is just the unit
matrix δa

µ in ﬂat space-time.

Diﬀerent groups of symmetric indices are separated by commas. Each group corresponds to

a row in the Young tableau associated to the representation the tensor sits in. For example,

is a tensor whose symmetry properties are deﬁned by the Young tableau

ψa1a2...am,b1...bn,

(n ≤ m)

a1 a2 . . .am
b1 . . .bn

10

i.e. ψ(a1a2...am,b1)...bn = 0.

Symmetrizations of indices are not weighted and are denoted with round brackets, e.g.

A(a1 Ba2a3) ≡ Aa1Ba2a3 + Aa2Ba1a3 + Aa3 Ba2a1 .

We also use the short-hand notation for contractions involving γ matrices, e.g.

The gamma–matrices obey the Cliﬀord algebra

✓✓ψa1...an ≡ γan+1ψa1...anan+1, ✓∂ ≡ γµ∂µ .

γaγb + γbγa = 2ηab .

In D = 4 the gamma-matrices are purely imaginary in the Majorana representation.
