Abstract

Let G = (V, E) be a simple graph. For any integer k ≥ 1, a subset of V is called
a k-tuple total dominating set of G if every vertex in V has at least k neighbors in
the set. The minimum cardinality of a minimal k-tuple total dominating set of G
is called the k-tuple total domination number of G. In this paper, we introduce the
concept of upper k-tuple total domination number of G as the maximum cardinality
of a minimal k-tuple total dominating set of G, and study the problem of ﬁnding a
minimal k-tuple total dominating set of maximum cardinality on several classes of
graphs, as well as ﬁnding general bounds and characterizations. Also, we ﬁnd some
results on the upper k-tuple total domination number of the Cartesian and cross
products of two graphs.

Keywords: k-tuple total domination number; upper k-tuple total domination number;
cross product; Cartesian product; hypergraph; (upper) k-transversal number.

1 Introduction

Preliminary deﬁnitions.

All graphs considered here are ﬁnite, undirected and simple. For standard graph theory
terminology not given here we refer to [14]. Let G = (V, E) be a graph with the vertex
set V of order n(G) and the edge set E of size m(G). The open neighborhood of a vertex
v ∈ V is NG(v) = {u ∈ V | uv ∈ E}, while its cardinality is the degree of v and denoted

by degG(v). The closed neighborhood of a vertex v ∈ V is also N [v] = NG(v) ∪ {v}.
The minimum and maximum degree of G are denoted by δ = δ(G) and ∆ = ∆(G),
respectively. We write Kn, Cn and Pn for a complete graph, a cycle, and a path of order
n, respectively, while Kn1,...,np denotes a complete p-partite graph.

The Cartesian product G (cid:3) H of two graphs G and H is a graph with the vertex set
V (G) × V (H) and two vertices (g1, h1) and (g2, h2) are adjacent if and only if either
g1 = g2 and (h1, h2) ∈ E(H), or h1 = h2 and (g1, g2) ∈ E(G), while the cross product
(also known as the direct product, tensor product, categorical product, and conjunction
in the literature) G × H has V (G) × V (H) as vertex set and two vertices (g1, h1) and
(g2, h2) are adjacent if and only if (g1, g2) ∈ E(G) and (h1, h2) ∈ E(H).

Deﬁnition 1.1. Let k ≥ 1 be an integer and let v ∈ S ⊆ V . A vertex v′ is called a
k-open private neighbor of v with respect to S, or simply a (S, k)-opn of v, if v′ ∈ NG(v)
and |NG(v′) ∩ S| = k, in other words, there exists a k-subset Sv ⊆ S containing v
such that NG(v′) ∩ S = Sv. More exactly, v′ is called an external or inner k-open
private neighbor of v with respect to S if v′ ∈ V − S or v′ ∈ S, respectively. The set
opnk(v; S) = {v′ ∈ V |v′ is a (S, k)-opn of v} is called the k-open private neighborhood
set of v with respect to S.

For any positive integer k, the k-join G ◦k H of a graph G to a graph H of order at least
k is the graph obtained from the disjoint union of G and H by joining each vertex of G
to at least k vertices of H.

Hypergraphs.

Hypergraphs are systems of sets which are conceived as natural extensions of graphs. A
hypergraph H = (V, E) is a set V of elements, called vertices, together with a multiset
E of arbitrary subsets of V , called edges. For integer k ≥ 1, a k-uniform hypergraph is a
hypergraph in which every edge has size k. Every simple graph is a 2-uniform hypergraph.
For a graph G = (V, E), HG = (V, C) denotes the open neighborhood hypergraph of G
with the vertex set V and edge set C consisting of the open neighborhoods of vertices of
V in G.

A transversal in a hypergraph H = (V, E) is a subset S ⊆ V such that |S ∩ e| ≥ 1 for
every edge e ∈ E; that is, the set S meets every edge in H. The transversal number
τ (H) of H is the minimum size of a transversal in it. In the next deﬁnition, we deﬁne
two new concepts similar to the transversal number.

Deﬁnition 1.2. For any integer k ≥ 1, we deﬁne a k-transversal
in a hypergraph
H = (V, E) as a subset S ⊆ V such that |S ∩ e| ≥ k for every edge e ∈ E; that is,
every edge in H contains at least k vertices from the set S. Also we deﬁne the upper
k-transversal number Υk(H) of H as the maximum cardinality of a minimal k-transversal
in H, while the k-transversal number τk(H) of H is the minimum cardinality of a minimal
k-transversal in H.

Upper k-tuple total domination.

Domination in graphs is now well studied in graph theory and the literature on this
subject has been surveyed and detailed in the two books by Haynes, Hedetniemi, and
Slater [5, 6]. A set S ⊆ V is a dominating set (resp.
total dominating set ) of G if
each vertex in V \ S (resp. V ) is adjacent to at least one vertex of S. The domination
number γ(G) (resp. total domination number γt(G)) of G is the minimum cardinality of
a dominating set (resp. total dominating set) of G.

The concept of k-tuple total domination, which is an extension of total domination,
introduced in [7] by Henning and Kazemi, and studied more, for example, in [10, 11].

Deﬁnition 1.3. [8] Let k ≥ 1 be an integer and let G be a graph with δ ≥ k. A subset
S ⊆ V is called a k-tuple total dominating set, brieﬂy kTDS, in G if for each x ∈ V ,
|N (x)∩S| ≥ k. The minimum number of vertices of a kTDS in G is called the k-tuple total
domination number of G and denoted by γ×k,t(G). A kTDS with cardinality γ×k,t(G) is
called a γ×k,t(G)-set.

Now we deﬁne the concept of upper k-tuple total domination number of a graph as
follows.

Deﬁnition 1.4. The upper k-tuple total domination number Γ×k,t(G) of G is the max-
imum cardinality of a minimal kTDS of G, and a k-tuple total dominating set with
cardinality Γ×k,t(G) is a Γ×k,t(G)-set. Also, we say that a graph G is a Γ×k,t-external
graph if it has a Γ×k,t-set S such that every vertex in it has an external k-open private
neighbor with respect to S.

Obviously, for every graph G and every positive integer k, γ×k,t(G) ≤ Γ×k,t(G), and this
bound is sharp, because for every 1 ≤ k < n, γ×k,t(Kn) = Γ×k,t(Kn) = k + 1. We remark
that the upper 1-tuple total domination number Γ×1,t(G) is the well-studied upper total
domination number Γt(G), while the upper 2-tuple total domination number is known
as the upper double total domination number. The redundancy involved in upper k-tuple
total domination makes it useful in many applications.

In this paper, we initiate to study the problem of ﬁnding a minimal k-tuple total domi-
nating set of maximum cardinality on several classes of graphs, as well as ﬁnding general
bounds and characterizations. Also we present a conjecture on the upper k-tuple total
domination number, similar to the Vizing’s conjecture, and prove it for a family of graphs.
Proving Γ×kℓ,t(G × H) ≥ Γ×k,t(G)Γ×ℓ,t(H) is our next work, where k, ℓ ≥ 1 are integers.
Then we character a graph G satisfy Γ×k,t(G) = γ×k,t(G), and show that for any graph
G with minimum degree at least k, 1) Γ×k,t(G) = Υk(HG), and 2) Γ×k,t(G) = γ×k,t(G)
if and only if Υk(HG) = τk(HG).

We begin our discussion with the following observation. The proof follows readily from
the deﬁnitions and is omitted.

Observation 1.5. Let k ≥ 1 be an integer and let G be a graph of order n with δ(G) ≥ k.
Then

i. γ×k,t(G) ≤ Γ×k,t(G) ≤ n,

ii. every kTDS S in G is minimal if and only if opnk(v; S) 6= ∅ for every vertex v ∈ S,

iii. all neighbors of every vertex of degree k in G belong to every kTDS of G, and

iv. if H is a spanning subgraph of G which has a Γ×k,t-set that is also a minimal kTDS
of G, then Γ×k,t(H) ≤ Γ×k,t(G).

Observation 1.5 (iii) implies the next proposition.

Proposition 1.6. If G is a k-regular graph, then Γ×k,t(G) = n.

The converse of Proposition 1.6 does not hold. For example, if G is the graph obtained
by the union of two disjoint complete graphs of order k + 1 ≥ 3, with an edge between
them, then G is not regular but Γ×k,t(G) = 2k + 2.

The next two propositions from [3] and [7] are useful for our investigations.

Proposition 1.7. (Dorbec et al. [3] 2007) For any path Pn of order n ≥ 2,

Γt(Pn) = 2⌊

n + 1

3

⌋.

Proposition 1.8. (Henning, Kazemi [7] 2010) Let G be a graph with δ(G) ≥ k.
Then γ×k,t(G) = k + 1 if and only if G = Kk+1 or G = F ◦k Kk+1 for some graph F .

2 The upper k-tuple total domination number of some

graphs

In this section, we calculate the upper k-tuple total domination number of a path, a cycle
and a complete multipartite graph. Proposition 1.6 implies Γ×2,t(Cn) = n. The next
proposition calculates Γt(Cn).

Proposition 2.1. For any cycle Cn of order n ≥ 3,

Γt(Cn) = (cid:26) 2⌊ n
3 ⌋ + 1 if n ≡ 2
2⌊ n
3 ⌋

otherwise.

(mod 3),

Proof. Let V (Cn) = {1, 2, ..., n}, and let ij ∈ E(Cn) if and only if j ≡ i + 1 (mod n).
Let S be a Γt(Cn)-set. If at least one vertex of any two consecutive vertices belongs to S,

Upper k-tuple total domination in graphs

5

then n ≡ 0 (mod 3). Since, in otherwise, S will contain at least three consecutive vertices
of V (Cn), which contracts the minimality of S. Hence |S| = 2⌊ n
3 ⌋, when n ≡ 0 (mod 3).
Now, assume that there exist two consecutive vertices, say 1 and n, which do not belong to
S. Then S is also a minimal TDS in Pn = Cn − {e}, where e = 1n ∈ E(Cn). This implies
|S| = Γt(Cn) ≤ Γt(Pn) = 2⌊ n+1
3 ⌋ (the last equality is obtained by Proposition 1.7). Now
since {3i + 1, 3i + 2|0 ≤ i ≤ ⌊ n
3 ⌋ − 1} is a minimal TDS in Cn with cardinality Γt(Pn)
when n 6≡ 2 (mod 3), we obtain Γt(Cn) = 2⌊ n+1
3 ⌋. Now for n ≡ 2 (mod 3), let
S be a minimal TDS in Cn with cardinality Γt(Pn). Then there exist seven consecutive
vertices, say 1, 2, ..., 7, such that S ∩{1, 2, ..., 7} = {i}, where i = 2 or 4. Since S − {i + 1}
is a TDS in Cn with cardinality less than the cardinality of S, we deduce |S| < Γt(Pn).
Therefore, Γt(Cn) < Γt(Pn), and since {3i + 1, 3i + 2|0 ≤ i ≤ ⌊ n
3 ⌋ − 1} ∪ {n} is a minimal
TDS in Cn with cardinality Γt(Pn) − 1 = 2⌊ n

3 ⌋ + 1, we obtain Γt(Cn) = 2⌊ n

3 ⌋ = 2⌊ n

3 ⌋ + 1.

Now we study the upper k-tuple total domination number of a complete multipartite
graph.

Theorem 2.2. Let G = Kn1,n2,...,np be a complete p-partite graph with δ ≥ k ≥ 1. If
n1 ≤ n2 ≤ ... ≤ np, then

Γ×k,t(G) = k + max{x|(ℓ − 1)x = k and x ≤ min{k, np−ℓ+1, ..., np}}.

Proof. Let V = X1 ∪X2 ∪...∪Xp be the partition of the vertices of G to the p independent
sets X1, X2, ...,Xp, and let S be a minimal kTDS in G. Let I = {ij|j = 1, .., ℓ} be an
index subset of {1, 2, .., p} for some 2 ≤ ℓ ≤ p such that S ∩ Xi 6= ∅ if and only if i ∈ I.
Also assume that |S ∩Xij | = xij for any ij ∈ I, and xi1 ≤ xi2 ≤ ... ≤ xiℓ . The minimality
of S implies that xij ≤ k, for any ij ∈ I, and there exists a (ℓ − 1)-subset L ⊆ I such

that Pij ∈L xij = k. Since S is minimal, this implies that for every (ℓ − 1)-subset L ⊆ I,
we have Pij ∈L xij = k. Hence xi1 = xi2 = ... = xiℓ . Let x := xi1 = xi2 = ... = xiℓ .

Then xi1 + xi2 + ... + xiℓ = ℓx = k + x ≤ Γ×k,t(G), where x ≤ min{k, ni1 , ..., niℓ }. Thus

Γ×k,t(G) = k + max{x|(ℓ − 1)x = k and x ≤ min{k, ni1 , ..., niℓ }}

= k + max{x|(ℓ − 1)x = k and x ≤ min{k, np−ℓ+1, ..., np}}.

Corollary 2.3. Let G = Kn1,n2,...,np be a complete p-partite graph. If there exist two
distinct indices i and j such that ni ≥ nj ≥ k ≥ 1, then Γ×k,t(G) = 2k.

The next theorem can be proved with a proof similar to the proof of Theorem 2.2.

Theorem 2.4. Let G = Kn1,n2,...,np be a complete p-partite graph with δ ≥ k ≥ 1. If
n1 ≤ n2 ≤ ... ≤ np, then

γ×k,t(G) ≤ k + min{x|(ℓ − 1)x = k and x ≤ min{k, n1, ..., nℓ}}.

3 Two upper bounds

In this section, we present two upper bounds for the upper k-tuple total domination
number of a graph. The ﬁrst is in terms of k and the order and the minimum degree of
the graph, and the second is in terms of the upper ℓ-tuple total domination number of
the graph for some ℓ < k.

Theorem 3.1. If G is a graph of order n with δ ≥ k + 1 ≥ 2, then Γ×k,t(G) ≤ n − δ + k,
and this bound is sharp.

Proof. Let S be a Γ×k,t(G)-set. By Observation 1.5 (ii), for each vertex v ∈ S there exist
a k-subset Sv ⊆ S and a vertex v′ ∈ V (G) such that NG(v′) ∩ S = Sv. If v′ ∈ S, then
NG(v′) − Sv ⊆ V (G) − S. Hence δ − k ≤ deg(v′) − k ≤ n − |S| = n − Γ×k,t(G), which
implies that Γ×k,t(G) ≤ n − δ + k. If v′ 6∈ S, then v′ is not adjacent to at least |S| − k
vertices of S − Sv. Hence δ ≤ deg(v′) ≤ n − |S| + k − 1 = n − Γ×k,t(G) + k − 1, which
implies that Γ×k,t(G) < n − δ + k.

That the bound is sharp, may be seen as follows. Let δ ≥ k + 1 ≥ 2 be integers. Consider
b vertex-disjoint complete graphs Kk+1 where b ≥ ⌈ δ
k+1 ⌉, and let Hb = Kk+1 + ... + Kk+1
(the union of b vertex-disjoint complete graphs Kk+1). Also consider an empty graph T
with δ−k vertices. Let Gb = Hb◦T be the union of Hb and T such that every vertex of Hb
is adjacent to all vertices in T . Then Gb is a connected graph of order n = b(k + 1) + δ − k
with minimum degree δ. Since V (Hb) is a minimal k-tuple total dominating set of Gb,
we obtain Γ×k,t(G) ≥ n − δ + k. Consequently Γ×k,t(G) = n − δ + k.

Theorem 3.2. Let G be a graph with δ ≥ k ≥ 1. Let L = ∩v∈SSv, where S is a
Γ×k,t(G)-set and Sv is the set given in Deﬁnition 1.1. If |L| = ℓ < k, then

Γ×k,t(G) ≤ Γ×(k−ℓ),t(G) + ℓ.

Proof. Let S be a Γ×k,t(G)-set and let L = ∩v∈SSv which has cardinality ℓ. Since S − L
is a minimal (k − ℓ)TDS in G, we obtain

Γ×(k−ℓ),t(G) ≥ |S − L|
= |S| − |L|
= Γ×k,t(G) − ℓ.

4 A vizing-like conjecture

In 1968 Vizing made the following conjecture which he ﬁrst posed as a question in 1963.

Upper k-tuple total domination in graphs

7

Vizing’s Conjecture: [13] For any graphs G and H, γ(G)γ(H) ≤ γ(G (cid:3) H).

Vizing’s conjecture hasn’t been settled (although the conjecture has been proven true for
large classes of graphs) and is the most famous open problem involving domination in
graphs. The best general upper bound to date on the product of the domination numbers
of two graphs in terms of their Cartesian product is due to Clark and Suen who showed in
[2] that for any graphs G and H, γ(G)γ(H) ≤ 2γ(G (cid:3) H). Several variations of Vizing’s
conjecture have been studied. In 1996, Nowakowski and Rall in [12] made the following
Vizing-like conjecture for the upper domination of Cartesian products of graphs.

Nowakowski-Rall’s Conjecture: [12] For any graphs G and H, Γ(G)Γ(H) ≤ Γ(G (cid:3) H).

A beautiful proof of the Nowakowski-Rall’s Conjecture was recently found by Brear [1].
In [9], a version of Vizing’s conjecture for total domination is studied. For certain classes
of graphs G without isolated vertices (including the class of trees of order at least 2) and
for any graph H without isolated vertices, it is shown that γt(G)γt(H) ≤ 2γt(G (cid:3) H).
However it remains an open question (see [9]) to determine whether the product of the
total domination numbers of two general graphs without isolated vertices is at most twice
the total domination number of their Cartesian product. Paul Dorbec et al. also in [4]
proved that for any graphs G and H with no isolated vertices, Γt(G)Γt(H) ≤ Γt(G (cid:3) H),
that is, Γ×k,t(G)Γ×k,t(H) ≤ Γ×k,t(G (cid:3) H) for k = 1. We conjecture this is also true
when k ≥ 2.

Conjecture: For any integer k ≥ 2, and any graphs G and H with minimum degree
at least k, Γ×k,t(G)Γ×k,t(H) ≤ Γ×k,t(G (cid:3) H).

We show that the conjecture is true for the family of Γ×k,t-external graphs. We recall
that G is a Γ×k,t-external graph means that G has a Γ×k,t-set S such that every vertex
in S has an external (S, k)-opn.

Theorem 4.1. For any two Γ×k,t-external graphs G and H,

Γ×k,t(G (cid:3) H) ≥ max{Γ×k,t(G) · |V (H)|, Γ×k,t(H) · |V (G)|}.

Proof. Let max{Γ×k,t(G) · |V (H)|, Γ×k,t(H) · |V (G)|} = Γ×k,t(G) · |V (H)|, and let DG
be a Γ×k,t-set of G such that every vertex of it has an external (DG, k)-opn. Then it can
easily be seen that D = DG×V (H) is a kTDS in G (cid:3) H. Now we show that D is minimal.
For this aim, it suﬃces to prove that for any vertex (v, w) ∈ D, opnk((v, w); D) 6= ∅.
Let v′ ∈ opnk(v; DG) ∩ (V (G) − DG). Then NG(v′) ∩ DG = {v, v1, v2, ..., vk−1}, for some
vertices v1, v2, ..., vk−1 ∈ DG. Thus

NG (cid:3) H ((v′, w)) ∩ D = ((NG(v′) × {w}) ∪ ({v′} × NH(w)) ∩ D

= (NG(v′) ∩ DG) × {w} ∪ (∅ × NH (w)
= {(v, w), (v1, w), (v2, w), ..., (vk−1, w)},

Upper k-tuple total domination in graphs

8

and so opnk((v, w); D) 6= ∅, for every vertex (v, w) ∈ D. Hence

Γ×k,t(G (cid:3) H) ≥ |D|

≥ Γ×k,t(G) · |V (H)|
= max{Γ×k,t(G) · |V (H)|, Γ×k,t(H) · |V (G)|}.

The next theorem is immediately obtained by Proposition 1.6 and Theorems 3.1 and 4.1.

Theorem 4.2. Let G be a Γ×k,t-external graph, and let H be an arbitrary graph. Then
the following statements hold.

i. If δ(H) ≥ k + 1, then Γ×k,t(G (cid:3) H) ≥ Γ×k,t(G)(Γ×k,t(H) + δ(H) − k).

ii. If H is k-regular, then Γ×k,t(G (cid:3) H) ≥ Γ×k,t(G)Γ×k,t(H).

iii. If H is not k-regular and δ(H) = k, then Γ×k,t(G (cid:3) H) ≥ Γ×k,t(G)(Γ×k,t(H) + 1).

As a result of the previous theorems, we obtain the following theorem.

Theorem 4.3. Let G be a Γ×k,t-external graph with δ(G) ≥ k ≥ 2. Then for any graph
H with δ(H) ≥ k,

Γ×k,t(G (cid:3) H) ≥ Γ×k,t(G) · Γ×k,t(H).

5 The cross product of two graphs

In this section, we study the upper k-tuple total domination number of the cross product
of two graphs.

Theorem 5.1. If G and H are graphs satisfying δ(G) ≥ k ≥ 1 and δ(H) ≥ ℓ ≥ 1, then

Γ×kℓ,t(G × H) ≥ Γ×k,t(G) · Γ×ℓ,t(H).

Proof. Let DG be a Γ×k,t(G)-set and let DH be a Γ×ℓ,t(H)-set. We ﬁrst show that the
(set) cartesian product DG × DH of DG and DH is a kℓTDS in G × H. Let (u, v) be a
vertex in G × H. Let Du = DG ∩ NG(u), Dv = DH ∩ NH(v) and let Duv = Du × Dv.
Note that Duv ⊆ DG × DH . Since DG is a kTDS in G and DH is a ℓTDS in H, we have
|Du| ≥ k and |Dv| ≥ ℓ. Hence |Duv| ≥ kℓ. Since NG×H((u, v)) = NG(u) × NH (v), we
obtain Duv ⊆ NG×H((u, v)).

Now we show that DG × DH is minimal. Let (a, b) ∈ DG × DH . Then a ∈ DG and
b ∈ DH. The minimality of DG and DH imply that there exist vertices a′ ∈ V (G),

Upper k-tuple total domination in graphs

9

b′ ∈ V (H) and a k-subset Sa ⊆ DG and a ℓ-subset Sb ⊆ DH such that NG(a′) ∩ DG = Sa
and NH (b′) ∩ DH = Sb. Therefore, there exist the vertex (a′, b′) ∈ V (G × H) and the
kℓ-subset S(a,b) = Sa × Sb such that NG×H ((a′, b′)) ∩ (DG × DH ) = S(a,b). Because if
(x, y) ∈ NG×H((a′, b′)) ∩ (DG × DH ), then x ∈ NG(a′) ∩ DG and y ∈ NH (b′) ∩ DH, and
so (x, y) ∈ Sa × Sb = S(a,b). On the other hand, if (x, y) ∈ S(a,b), then x ∈ NG(a′) ∩ DG
and y ∈ NH (b′) ∩ DH, and so (x, y) ∈ NG×H((a′, b′)) ∩ (DG × DH). Therefore

Γ×kℓ,t(G × H) ≥ |DG × DH |
= |DG| · |DH |
= Γ×k,t(G) · Γ×ℓ,t(H).

Corollary 5.2. If G and H are graphs satisfying δ(G) ≥ δ(H) ≥ k ≥ 1, then

Γ×k,t(G × H) ≥ max{Γ×k,t(G) · Γt(H), Γ×k,t(H) · Γt(G)}.

The next proposition shows that the equality may be hold in Theorem 5.1.

Proposition 5.3. Let 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1. Then Γ×k,t(Kn × K2) = 2k + 2.

Proof. Corollary 5.2 implies that

Γ×k,t(Kn × K2) ≥ Γ×k,t(Kn) · Γt(K2) = 2k + 2.

Let S be a Γ×k,t(Kn × K2)-set. Let V (Kn × K2) = V1 ∪ V2, where Vi = {1, 2, ..., n} × {i}
for i = 1, 2. Let also Si = S ∩ Vi, for i = 1, 2, and |S1| ≥ |S2|. Clearly |Si| ≥ k for each
i, and the minimality of S implies that |S2| ≤ k + 1. Since S has maximum cardinality,
|S2| = k +1. If |S1| > k +1, then for every vertex v ∈ S1 −S ′
2, the set S −{v} is a kTDS in
Kn × K2, where S ′
2 = {(a, 1)|(a, 2) ∈ S2}, a contradiction. Therefore |S1| = |S2| = k + 1,
and so Γ×k,t(Kn × K2) = 2k + 2.

Now we present a lower bound for the upper k-tuple total domination number of the
cross product of two complete multipartite graphs.

Proposition 5.4. For any integers m ≥ n ≥ 2, let G = Kt1,t2,...,tm be a complete m-
partite graph, and let H = Ks1,s2,...,sn be a complete n-partite graph. Let δ(G × H) ≥ k.

If there exist either two distinct indices i and j such that P1≤ℓ≤n tisℓ ≥ P1≤ℓ≤n tjsℓ ≥
2k or two distinct indices ℓ and r such that P1≤i≤m sℓti ≥ P1≤i≤m srti ≥ 2k, then

Γ×k,t(G × H) ≥ 4k.

Proof. Let V (G) = X1 ∪ X2 ∪ ... ∪ Xm be the partition of the vertices of G to the m
disjoint independent sets X1, X2, ..., Xm, and let V (H) = Y1 ∪ Y2 ∪ ... ∪ Yn be the
partition of the vertices of H to the n disjoint independent sets Y1, Y2, ..., Yn such that

Upper k-tuple total domination in graphs

10

for each i and j, |Xi| = ti and |Yj | = sj. Then S1≤i≤m, 1≤j≤n(Xi × Yj) is a partition of

the vertices of G × H. Without loss of generality, we may assume that

X1≤ℓ≤n

t1sℓ ≥ X1≤ℓ≤n

t2sℓ ≥ 2k,

and also there exists the sum k = k1 + k2 + ... + kr to the positive integers k1, k2, ..., kr
such that ki ≤ min{t1si, t2si, t1si+r, t2si+r}, for each i. Let S be a subset of V (G × H)
such that |S ∩ (X1 × Yi)| = ki. Then S is a minimal kTDS in G × H, implying that
Γ×k,t(G × H) ≥ 4k.

6 Upper k-transversal in hypergraphs

In this section, we show that the problem of ﬁnding upper k-tuple total dominating sets
in graphs can be translated to the problem of ﬁnding upper k-transversal in hypergraphs.

Theorem 6.1. If G is a graph with δ(G) ≥ k ≥ 1, and HG is the open neighborhood
hypergraph of G, then Γ×k,t(G) = Υk(HG).

Proof. On the one hand, every kTDS in G contains at least k vertices from the open
neighborhood of each vertex in G, and is therefore a k-transversal in HG. On the other
hand, every k-transversal in HG contains at least k vertices from the open neighborhood
of each vertex of G, and is therefore a kTDS in G. Therefore a vertex subset S is a kTDS
in G if and only if it is a k-transversal in HG. Since also every subset S is a minimal
kTDS in G if and only if it is a minimal k-transversal in HG, our proof will be completed.
Hence Γ×k,t(G) = Υk(HG).

The authors in [7] proved that the problem of ﬁnding k-tuple total dominating sets in
graphs can be translated to the problem of ﬁnding k-transversal in hypergraphs, that is,
for every integer k ≥ 1 and every graph G with minimum degree k, γ×k,t(G) = τk(HG).
This fact and Theorem 6.1 imply the next theorem.

Theorem 6.2. Let G be a graph with δ(G) ≥ k ≥ 1, and HG is the open neighborhood
hypergraph of G. Then Γ×k,t(G) = γ×k,t(G) if and only if Υk(HG) = τk(HG).

To continue our discussion, we character graphs G satisfying γ×k,t(G) = m, for any
integer m ≥ k + 1 ≥ 2. Proposition 1.8 did this for m = k + 1. Here, we do it for
m ≥ k + 2.

Theorem 6.3. Let G be a graph with δ(G) ≥ k ≥ 1, and let m ≥ k + 2 be an integer.
Then γ×k,t(G) = m if and only if G = K ′
m, where m is the minimum

Proof. Let S be a γ×k,t-set of G = (V, E) with cardinality m ≥ k + 2. Then every vertex
has at least k neighbors in S. Then G[S] = K ′
m of Km
and δ(K ′
m. Otherwise, let F = G[V − S]. Since every
vertex in V − S has at least k neighbors in S, we conclude that G = F ◦k K ′

the deﬁnition of k-tuple total domination number, m is the minimum of the set T .

Conversely, let G = K ′

m) is a kTDS with cardinality m, γ×k,t(G) ≤ m. We
may conclude that γ×k,t(G) = m. Because if γ×k,t(G) = m′ for some m′ < m, then the
previous paragraph implies that for some graph F ′ and some spanning subgraph K ′
m′ of
Km′, G = F ′ ◦k K ′

m′, which contradicts the minimality of m.

The next theorem can be obtained, by Proposition 1.8 and Theorem 6.3.

Theorem 6.4. Let G be a graph with δ(G) ≥ k ≥ 1. Then Γ×k,t(G) = γ×k,t(G) if and
only if for some integer m ≥ k + 1, G = K ′
m, where m is the minimum
of the set

t, for a graph F ′ and a spanning subgraph K ′

and F = G − K ′

Now Theorems 6.2 and 6.4 imply the next result.

Theorem 6.5. Let k ≥ 1 be an integer. For any hypergraph H, Υk(H) = τk(H) if and
only if H = HG for some graph G such that G = K ′

subgraph K ′
