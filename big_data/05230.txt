Restricted rational Cherednik algebras

Ulrich Thiel∗

Abstract. We give an overview of the representation theory of restricted rational
Cherednik algebras. These are certain ﬁnite-dimensional quotients of rational Cherednik
algebras at t = 0. Their representation theory is connected to the geometry of the
Calogero–Moser space, and there is a lot of evidence that they contain certain information
about Hecke algebras even though the precise connection is so far unclear. We outline the
basic theory along with some open problems and conjectures, and give explicit results in
the cyclic and dihedral cases.

Introduction

In 2002 Etingof and Ginzburg [32] introduced the so-called rational Cherednik
algebras. These are (non-commutative) C-algebras Ht,c deforming the skew group
ring C[h ⊕ h∗] (cid:111) W attached to a ﬁnite reﬂection group W acting on a ﬁnite-
dimensional complex vector space h. They depend on the choice of two parameters
t and c, where t is just a complex number and c is a map Ref(W ) → C from the set
of reﬂections of W to the complex numbers which is invariant under W -conjugation
of reﬂections.
There is the following dichotomy in the behavior of rational Cherednik algebras
which separates them into two quite distinct worlds: if t (cid:54)= 0, then the center Z(Ht,c)
is as small as possible, i.e., Z(Ht,c) = C, and if t = 0, then Z(H0,c) is so large that the
inﬁnite-dimensional algebra H0,c becomes a ﬁnite module over Z(H0,c). Moreover,
if t (cid:54)= 0, which after rescaling is equivalent to t = 1, then H1,0 = D(h) (cid:111) W , where
D(h) is the ring of diﬀerential operators on h. So, the algebras H1,c deform the skew
diﬀerential operator ring and this signiﬁes for example that the theory of D-modules
plays a role for t (cid:54)= 0. The representation theory of Ht,c and the methods to study
it thus heavily depend on whether t = 0 or t (cid:54)= 0.
The case t (cid:54)= 0 has attracted a lot of interest. One of the many reasons for
this is the work of Ginzburg–Guay–Opdam–Rouquier [39]. They deﬁned a certain
subcategory Oc of the category H1,c-mod of ﬁnitely generated H1,c-modules and
showed that it is a highest weight category whose standard modules are naturally
indexed by Irr W , the set of irreducible complex representations of W . In particular,
the simple objects in Oc are naturally indexed by Irr W . Moreover, they constructed
an exact functor

KZ : Oc → Hq(c)-mod

to the module category of the cyclotomic Hecke algebra attached to W at a certain
parameter q(c) derived from c. This functor was used to prove properties of Oc

using properties of cyclotomic Hecke algebras. Astonishingly, it was also used the
other way around by Losev [56] to prove a weak version of the freeness conjecture
about cyclotomic Hecke algebras by Broué–Malle–Rouquier [20].
So, for t (cid:54)= 0 we have a strong connection between rational Cherednik algebras
and Hecke algebras. This is diﬀerent for t = 0 since the construction of the KZ-
functor does not work here anymore. It is not even clear what a correct analog
of the category Oc could be. Still, it seems that there is some information about
Hecke algebras contained in H0,c—as if the KZ-functor left some traces in the
limit process t → 0. There is a certain natural ﬁnite-dimensional quotient Hc
of H0,c, called the restricted rational Cherednik algebra, which controls a lot of
the representation theory of H0,c. This quotient was ﬁrst studied more closely by
Gordon [41] who showed that there is a natural bijection Irr W (cid:39) Irr Hc between
isomorphism classes of simple modules (recall the bijection Irr W (cid:39) Irr Oc for t (cid:54)= 0
from above!). This implies in particular that the block structure of Hc yields a
natural c-dependent partition CMc of Irr W , called the Calogero–Moser c-families.
Assuming Lusztig’s conjectures P1–P15, see [57], Gordon and Martino [45] showed
that for W of type Bn these families match up with the Kazhdan–Lusztig families
coming from the Hecke algebra (see [51] and [38]), and they conjecture that this
holds for all Weyl groups. The Kazhdan–Lusztig families play an important role in
the representation theory of the ﬁnite groups of Lie type, so it is astonishing that
such information seems to be encoded in Hc. When assuming Lusztig’s conjectures,
the Kazhdan–Lusztig families coincide with the so-called Lusztig families, also
coming from the Hecke algebra (see [57]), so it makes sense to conjecture equality
of the Calogero–Moser families and the Lusztig families for all Coxeter groups, see
[15]. This was in fact shown to be true for almost all Coxeter groups by the work of
Etingof–Ginzburg [32], Gordon [41], Gordon–Martino [45], Bellamy [2, 1], Martino
[60], by the author [71], and by Bonnafé and the author [16]. The conjecture is
only open for the four exceptional groups H4, E6, E7, and E8. This is a hint that
there is information about Hecke algebras contained in Hc. The problem is: we do
not really know why—the proofs are obtained “simply” by computing both sides
separately and comparing.

What is nice about the Calogero–Moser families is that they have a geometric
interpretation: the spectrum Xc of the center Zc of H0,c is an irreducible variety
with a natural C∗-action, called the Calogero–Moser space, and we have a natural
bijection CMc (cid:39) XC∗
c . Hence, due to the positive result about the Gordon–Martino
conjecture we also get a geometric description of Lusztig’s families. This gives
us new methods to study these families. The Calogero–Moser space Xc carries a
natural Poisson bracket deforming the one on (h ⊕ h∗)/W coming from the natural
symplectic form on h ⊕ h∗. We note that the Poisson bracket on Xc actually comes
from the commutator in the Cherednik algebra Ht,c for t (cid:54)= 0, so the worlds t = 0
and t (cid:54)= 0 are indeed not entirely separated. It was shown by Brown and Gordon
[23] that Xc admits a stratiﬁcation into so-called symplectic leaves. Using Poisson
geometry of Xc and the above bijection, Bellamy [3] sorted out special Calogero–
Moser families, namely those where the corresponding C∗-ﬁxed point of Xc lies on
a zero-dimensional symplectic leaf. These families are called cuspidal. Bellamy

and the author [8] conjecture that the cuspidal Calogero–Moser families coincide
with the cuspidal Lusztig families, thus extending the Gordon–Martino conjecture.
Here, a Lusztig family is cuspidal if it is (up to sign) minimal with respect to
Lusztig’s j-induction, see [57]. It was shown by Bellamy and the author [8], and
by Bonnafé and the author [16], that this conjecture is true for all Coxeter groups
except possibly H4, E6, E7, and E8. And again: we do not know the conceptual
reason for this.

The conjectural connection between Calogero–Moser spaces and Hecke algebras
was lifted to a new level by the work of Bonnafé and Rouquier [13, 14]. For an
arbitrary complex reﬂection group W they used a Galois covering of the Calogero–
Moser space to construct a c-dependent decomposition of W into so-called Calogero–
Moser c-cells and to construct so-called Calogero–Moser c-cellular characters. They
conjecture that for Coxeter groups these objects coincide with the Kazhdan–Lusztig
cells and cellular characters, respectively. This can be viewed as a deep reﬁnement
of the Gordon–Martino conjecture.

Motivated by Bonnafé and Rouquier we call the quest for connections between
the Calogero–Moser and the Kazhdan–Lusztig world the “CM vs. KL program”. In
Figure 1 we summarize the situation (we note that this picture may not yet be
complete).

There are at least two motivations for this program:

(1) We might obtain new tools to study the Kazhdan–Lusztig side.
(2) On the Calogero–Moser side everything is naturally deﬁned for complex re-
ﬂection groups. So, once both sides match up for Weyl groups (or, more
generally, Coxeter groups), we immediately have an extension to complex
reﬂection groups. We might thus get a new point of view of the spetses by
Broué–Malle–Michel [18, 19] and new tools for studying modular representa-
tion theory of ﬁnite groups of Lie type.

This should motivate studying Calogero–Moser spaces and rational Cherednik
algebras at t = 0 more closely. The restricted rational Cherednik algebras form

one important piece in this picture. Next to information related to the CM vs.
KL program the restricted rational Cherednik algebras contain further interesting
information and combinatorics, in particular the graded decomposition matrices of
baby Verma modules and the graded W -characters of simple modules. A further
motivating problem is to understand if any of this information gives a hint about
the limit process t → 0, in particular about an appropriate analog of category Oc
and the KZ-functor at t = 0.

Outline. We will exclusively concentrate on the CM side here, and, even more
exclusively, on the representation theory of restricted rational Cherednik algebras.
The main problems about restricted rational Cherednik algebras we want to highlight
here are presented in Section 2.6. In Chapter 1 we review the few bits about rational
Cherednik algebras at t = 0 we need to be able to introduce the restricted rational
Cherednik algebras in Chapter 2. Theorem 1.34 about the PI-degree and Theorem
1.36 about the restricted double centralizer property seem not be covered in the
literature so far. In Chapter 3 we discuss several genericity properties and Chapter
4 is a toolbox where we collect several results that help to solve speciﬁc problems.
In Chapter 5, and in particular in Table 1 on page 44, we give a summary of what
has been solved already. In Chapter 6 we list some conjectures and some further
open problems. In Chapters A and B we give explicit solutions for cyclic and
dihedral groups.

Literature. We cover material (in varying detail) from the following papers, listed
in chronological order:

• 2002: Etingof–Ginzburg [32].
• 2003: Gordon [41].
• 2006: Martino [58].
• 2008: Brown–Gordon–Stroppel [24] and Gordon [43].
• 2009: Bellamy [1], Gordon–Martino [45].
• 2010: Bellamy [2], Martino [59].
• 2011: Bellamy [3].
• 2012: Bellamy [4].
• 2013: Bonnafé–Rouquier [13].
• 2014: Bellamy [6], Martino [60], the author [71, 72].
• 2015: Bellamy and the author [8], Bonnafé [15], the author [73].
• There is furthermore work in progress by Bellamy and the author [9] and by

Bonnafé and the author [16].

The bigger context. We cannot go into details here about the broader context of
rational Cherednik algebras and the geometry of Calogero–Moser spaces. There are
several extremely useful sources about this and we warmly recommend them to the

reader: apart from the original paper by Etingof–Ginzburg [32], there are excellent
survey papers by Gordon [42, 44] and by Rouquier [65], and excellent lecture notes
by Bellamy [5], by Chlouveraki [27], and by Losev [55]. We furthermore highly
recommend the wonderful manuscript [13] by Bonnafé and Rouquier.
Assumptions. Throughout, if nothing else is mentioned, we denote by K ⊆ C a
ﬁeld and by h a ﬁnite-dimensional K-vector space. All rings are associative and
unital. Modules are left-modules if nothing else is mentioned. To shorten notations
we will use the unusual notation A(cid:92) := Spec(A) for the scheme associated to a
commutative ring A.1

1. Rational Cherednik algebras at t = 0

In this chapter we review the few bits about rational Cherednik algebras at t = 0 we
need to be able to introduce the restricted rational Cherednik algebras in the next
chapter. We will concentrate on ring-theoretic and representation-theoretic aspects
and only brieﬂy comment on connections to geometry. Our philosophy throughout
is to view the rational Cherednik algebra as a sheaf of algebras on the parameter
scheme and to take restrictions to closed subschemes and ﬁbers in not necessarily
closed points into account. To this end, we introduce the notion of a geometric
C-algebra, where C = K[C ] is the generic parameter ring for rational Cherednik
algebras at t = 0. By this we simply mean a ring of the form (C/p)q/p for prime

Restricted rational Cherednik algebras

ideals p, q ∈ C(cid:92) = Spec(C) with q ⊇ p. Essentially all of the basic properties still
hold when we take such a ring as base ring for the rational Cherednik algebra. The
reader may, however, simply assume throughout that K = C and that c ∈ C(cid:92) is a
closed point, thus corresponding to an ordinary complex parameter.
1.1. Reﬂection groups. Let W ⊆ GL(h) be a ﬁnite reﬂection group, i.e., W is
generated by its set

Ref(W ) := {s ∈ W | codim Ker(idh −s) = 1}

(1)

of reﬂections. We consider h as a (faithful) W -module and denote the action of
w ∈ W on y ∈ h by wy. When choosing an isomorphism h (cid:39) K n we get an
embedding W (cid:44)→ GLn(K) (cid:44)→ GLn(C) and we call the GLn(C)-conjugacy class of
the image of W in GLn(C) the type of W . This does not depend on the choice of
the isomorphism h (cid:39) K n. Shephard and Todd [67] classiﬁed the types of irreducible
(and thus of all) reﬂection groups. Standard representatives of the types are (without
overlap!):
(G1) The symmetric group Sn+1 for n ≥ 4 in the irreducible n-dimensional reﬂection
representation obtained by taking the quotient of the natural action of Sn+1
on Cn+1 by the line e1 + . . . + en+1, where (ei) is the standard basis of Cn.
(G2) The groups G(m, p, n) of monomial matrices with m, n > 1, p ≥ 1 a divisor of
m, such that (m, p, n) (cid:54)= (2, 2, 2), (4, 4, 2). See [67] for the deﬁnition of these
groups.

(G3) Cyclic groups Cm for m ≥ 2 acting by a primitive m-th root of unity on C.
The 34 groups denoted by G4, . . . , G37, called exceptional groups. See [67] for
(G4–
G37)
the deﬁnition of these groups.

We also refer to [53] for a very nice treatment of the Shephard–Todd classiﬁcation.
An abstract ﬁnite group can have several non-isomorphic reﬂection representations,
see [12] for more details. We would like to mention the following result proven
in [72, Theorem 15.54] using the Shephard–Todd classiﬁcation. It shows that the
a priori misleading term “reﬂection group” is justiﬁed in the end.
Theorem 1.1. Irreducible ﬁnite reﬂection groups have the same type if and only
if they are isomorphic as abstract groups.

We have a natural action of W on h∗ given by ( wx)(y) = x( w−1

y). This deﬁnes
a subgroup W ∗ ⊆ GL(h∗), which is clearly again a reﬂection group and isomorphic
to W as an abstract group. Theorem 1.1 implies:
Corollary 1.2. If W ⊆ GL(h) is an irreducible ﬁnite reﬂection group, then the
dual group W ∗ ⊆ GL(h∗) is of the same type as W .
Remark 1.3. Theorem 1.1 does not hold when dropping the assumption that W
is irreducible: a counter-example is given by the Weyl groups G2 and A2 × A1.2

2I would like to thank Cédric Bonnafé for pointing this out.

1.2. Rational Cherednik algebras at t = 0. We denote by (cid:104)·,·(cid:105) : h× h∗ → K,
(y, x) := x(y), the canonical pairing. Let s ∈ Ref(W ). We call a non-zero element
s ∈ Im(idh −s) a root of s and call a non-zero element αs ∈ Im(idh∗ −(s∗)−1) a
α∨
coroot of s. Note that roots and coroots are unique up to scalars since the image
spaces are one-dimensional. Also note that (cid:104)α∨
s , αs(cid:105) (cid:54)= 0 since s is diagonalizable.
If εs denotes the (unique) non-trivial eigenvalue of s, we have

s(y) = y − (1 − εs)

(cid:104)y, αs(cid:105)
s , αs(cid:105) α∨
(cid:104)α∨
for all y ∈ h. We deﬁne a form (·,·)s : h × h∗ → K by
s , x(cid:105)(cid:104)y, αs(cid:105)
(cid:104)α∨

(y, x)s :=

s , αs(cid:105)

,

(cid:104)α∨

s

(3)

where α∨
the deﬁnition is independent of the choice of the root and coroot.

s and αs are arbitrary roots and coroots, respectively. It is easy to see that

Let C be the K-vector space of maps c : Ref(W ) → K which are constant on
conjugacy classes of reﬂections. The dimension of this space is clearly equal to the
number of conjugacy classes of reﬂections of W . For s ∈ Ref(W ) let c(s) be the
linear form on C given by evaluation on s. Then

is a basis of C ∗ and so the coordinate ring of C is given by

c := (c(s))s∈Ref(W )/W

C := K[C ] = K[c] .

We can consider c also as a map

c : Ref(W ) → C, s (cid:55)→ c(s) ,

which is constant on conjugacy classes of reﬂections.

(6)

By C(cid:104)h⊕ h∗(cid:105) we denote the tensor algebra of h⊕ h∗ over C and by C(cid:104)h⊕ h∗(cid:105)(cid:111) W
we denote the semidirect product with W , i.e., C(cid:104)h ⊕ h∗(cid:105) (cid:111) W is as a C-module
isomorphic to C(cid:104)h ⊕ h∗(cid:105) ⊗C CW with the usual multiplications inside C(cid:104)h ⊕ h∗(cid:105)
and CW and intertwining action wy = wyw and wx = wxw for y ∈ h and x ∈ h∗.
Deﬁnition 1.4 (Etingof–Ginzburg). The generic rational Cherednik algebra at
t = 0 of W is the quotient H of the C-algebra C(cid:104)h⊕ h∗(cid:105) (cid:111) W by the ideal generated
by the relations

(7)

and

[y, x] =

We can consider H as a sheaf of algebras over C(cid:92) := Spec(C) and there are two

natural operations we can perform. For c ∈ C(cid:92) we can form the quotient

H/cH = C/c ⊗C H ,

(9)

which is naturally a C/c-algebra and corresponds to the restriction of H to the zero
locus of c in C(cid:92). As a next step we can extend to the residue ﬁeld kC(c) := Frac(C/c)
of c to obtain

(10)
which is naturally a kC(c)-algebra. This is called the ﬁber (or specialization) of H
in c. In principle, this might be confused with localization in c but we think it is
the most consistent notation. The set C(cid:92)(K) of K-points of C(cid:92) can be naturally
identiﬁed with C , and for such a point c the ﬁber Hc is simply the K-algebra with
presentation as in Deﬁnition 1.4 but with C replaced by K and c(s) replaced by c(s).

Hc := kC(c) ⊗C H ,

To cover both (9) and (10) in one setting, we introduce the following concept.

Deﬁnition 1.5. A geometric C-algebra is a localization of an integral quotient of
C, i.e., a ring of the form c = (C/p)q/p for prime ideals p, q of C with q ⊇ p. We
then deﬁne

Hc := c ⊗C H = (H/pH)q/p .

(11)

The c-algebra Hc has the same presentation as in Deﬁnition 1.4 but with C
replaced by c and c(s) replaced by its image in c. Note that HC = H and that Hc
for c ∈ C(cid:92) as deﬁned in (10) is equal to HkC(c).
1.3. Gradings. For any geometric C-algebra c we can equip c(cid:104)h ⊕ h∗(cid:105) (cid:111) W with
a Z-grading deﬁned by

deg(h∗) = 1, deg(h) = −1, deg(W ) = 0, .

(12)
It is clear that c[h ⊕ h∗] (cid:111) W is a graded quotient of c(cid:104)h ⊕ h∗(cid:105) (cid:111) W and by the
deﬁning relations of Hc it is also clear that Hc is a graded quotient of c(cid:104)h⊕ h∗(cid:105) (cid:111) W .
On the generic algebra H one can deﬁne a ﬁner grading, namely an (N × N)-
grading. We follow Bonnafé and Rouquier [13, §4.2]. An (N × N)-grading on
c(cid:104)h ⊕ h∗(cid:105) (cid:111) W is deﬁned by

deg(h∗) = (0, 1), deg(h) = (1, 0), deg(W ) = (0, 0), deg(C ∗) = (1, 1) .

(13)

The relations for H are clearly homogeneous with respect to this grading, so the
above deﬁnes an (N × N)-grading on H. This induces via N × N → Z, (i, j) (cid:55)→ j − i,
the Z-grading on H just deﬁned. Via the map N × N → N, (i, j) (cid:55)→ i + j, it also
induces an N-grading on H which is deﬁned by

deg(h∗) = 1, deg(h) = 1, deg(W ) = 0, deg(C ∗) = 2 .

1.4. PBW theorem. Let c be a geometric C-algebra. We consider c(cid:104)h⊕ h∗(cid:105) (cid:111) W
with its standard grading deﬁned by

deg(h∗) = 1, deg(h) = 1, deg(W ) = 0 .

(15)

With respect to this grading the quotient Hc is not graded anymore but the grading
induces a ﬁltration on Hc. Whereas the left hand side of the relation (8) is of
N-degree 2, the right hand side is of N-degree 0. Hence, relation (8) becomes trivial
in the associated graded gr(Hc) of Hc with respect to the ﬁltration. This, and
the fact that c[h ⊕ h∗] (cid:111) W is a graded quotient of c(cid:104)h ⊕ h∗(cid:105) (cid:111) W , implies that
the quotient morphism c(cid:104)h ⊕ h∗(cid:105) (cid:111) W (cid:16) Hc induces a surjective graded c-algebra
morphism

ξ : c[h ⊕ h∗] (cid:111) W (cid:16) gr(Hc) .

(16)
This morphism is called the PBW morphism. The following theorem is called the
PBW theorem and was proven by Etingof and Ginzburg [32].3
Theorem 1.6 (Etingof–Ginzburg). The PBW morphism ξ is an isomorphism.
Hence, there is a c-module isomorphism c[h⊕ h∗] (cid:111) W (cid:39) Hc respecting the ﬁltration
and all deﬁned gradings. In particular, Hc is a free c-module.

It is now a standard fact that several ring-theoretic properties of the associated

graded are reﬂected to the original ring.
Corollary 1.7. The ring Hc is prime, noetherian, its center is an integral domain,
and its (left/right) global dimension is bounded above by the global dimension of
c[h ⊕ h∗]. In particular, if c is of ﬁnite global dimension, so is Hc.

1.5. Spherical subalgebra. As before, c can be an arbitrary geometric C-algebra.
The averaging idempotent in KW is the idempotent
w ∈ KW .

(cid:88)

e :=

(17)

1
|W|

w∈W

It is not hard to see that e is indeed an idempotent. It is easy to see that we have

(c[h ⊕ h∗] (cid:111) W )e = c[h ⊕ h∗]e and e(c[h ⊕ h∗] (cid:111) W )e (cid:39) c[h ⊕ h∗]W ,

(18)

the latter being a c-algebra isomorphism given by right multiplication with e. Since
KW ⊆ Hc, we can consider e as an idempotent in Hc.
Lemma 1.8. There is a natural identiﬁcation e(Hc)e = (eHe)c.
Proof. Since c is a geometric C-algebra, it is of the form c = (C/p)q/p for some
p, q ∈ C(cid:92) with q ⊇ p. Let us ﬁrst consider the case c = C/p. Then Hc = H/pH. We
have an exact sequence

0 → pH → H → H/pH → 0 .

3In [32] a proof over C is given but one can prove this also in general, see [13, Théorème 4.1.4]

or [72, §16] for details.

Restricted rational Cherednik algebras

Since multiplication with e is an exact functor, see beginning of this section, we
get an induced exact sequence

0 → e(pH)e → eHe → e(H/pH)e → 0 .

Clearly, e(pH)e = p(eHe), so from the above exact sequence we get an isomorphism

(eHe)c = (eHe)/p(eHe) (cid:39) e(Hc)e .

Since localization is exact, we get the claimed isomorphism for general c.

We denote the algebra in Lemma 1.8 by Uc and called it the spherical subalgebra
of Hc. Note that it is not a subalgebra in the precise sense since the unit of Uc is
equal to e. We call U := UC the generic spherical subalgebra at t = 0. By Lemma
1.8 we have

Uc = c ⊗C U .

(19)
The ﬁltration on Hc induces a ﬁltration on the module Hce and a ﬁltration on the
spherical subalgebra Uc. Moreover, Uc inherits all gradings we deﬁned on Hc since
we always have deg(e) = 0.
Lemma 1.9. The PBW morphism ξ : c[h ⊕ h∗] (cid:111) W
c-algebra isomorphisms

∼−→ gr(Hc) induces graded

c[h ⊕ h∗] (cid:39) gr(Hce)
We thus have c-module isomorphsims
c[h ⊕ h∗] (cid:39) Hce

and c[h ⊕ h∗]W (cid:39) gr(Uc) .

and c[h ⊕ h∗]W (cid:39) Uc

(20)

(21)

respecting all deﬁned gradings. Hence, Uc is prime, noetherian, and a free c-module.
Moreover, if c is normal, so is Uc.
Proof. This is just a consequence of (18) and standard facts about reﬂections of
properties of the associated graded to the original ring. The normality in case
c is normal is seen as follows: since K[h ⊕ h∗]W is just a polynomial ring, it is
geometrically normal and so the extension c[h⊕ h∗]W = c⊗K K[h⊕ h∗] is normal by
[70, Tag 06DF] if c is normal. Since c[h⊕ h∗]W is a noetherian domain, it is already
completely integrally closed. This property is now easily seen to be reﬂected to
Uc (cid:39) gr(c[h ⊕ h∗]W ), implying that Uc is normal.

1.6. Double centralizer property. We use the notations about double central-
izer properties from the Appendix C. The following theorem was shown by Etingof
and Ginzburg [32, Theorem 1.5(iv)].
Theorem 1.10. The pair (c[h⊕ h∗] (cid:111) W, e) satisﬁes the double centralizer property,
i.e., the natural map
c[h ⊕ h∗] (cid:111) W → Ende(c[h⊕h∗](cid:111)W )e((c[h ⊕ h∗] (cid:111) W )e) = Endc[h⊕h∗]W (c[h ⊕ h∗])
is an isomorphism.

12

By passing from Hc to its associated graded c[h ⊕ h∗]W , one can transfer the
double centralizer property also to the deformations Hc. This is due to Etingof and
Ginzburg [32, Theorem 1.5(iv)].4

Theorem 1.11 (Etingof–Ginzburg). The pair (Hc, e) satisﬁes the double centralizer
property, i.e., the natural map

Hc → EndeHce(Hce) = EndUc(Hce)

is an isomorphism.

From Lemma C.2 we obtain:

Corollary 1.12. Multiplication by e induces an isomorphism Z(Hc) (cid:39) Z(Uc) of
c-algebras respecting the ﬁltration and all deﬁned gradings.

The following fact due to Etingof and Ginzburg [32, Theorem 1.6] is of funda-
mental importance for the representation theory of rational Cherednik algebras at
t = 0.5

Theorem 1.13 (Etingof–Ginzburg). The spherical subalgebra Uc is commutative.

From Lemma 1.9 and Corollary 1.12 we immediately obtain:

Corollary 1.14. We have a graded c-algebra isomorphism c[h⊕ h∗]W → gr(Z(Hc))
and a ﬁltered c-module isomorphism

c[h ⊕ h∗]W ∼−→ Z(Hc)

(22)

respecting all deﬁned gradings. In particular Z(Hc) is an integral domain, noetherian,
and a free c-module. Moreover, if c is normal, so is Z(Hc).

Let

(23)
be the generic center. Since the spherical subalgebra behaves well under specializa-
tion by Lemma 1.8, we get the same for the center.

Z := Z(H)

Corollary 1.15. We have a natural identiﬁcation
Z(Hc) = Zc = c ⊗C Z .

(24)

The following lemma is shown in [13, Corollaire 5.2.11] for H, and it then follows
for general Hc by scalar extension using the fact that the center behaves well under
specialization by the preceding corollary.

Lemma 1.16. The center Zc is a direct summand of Hc as a Zc-module.

4Again, it was proven over the complex numbers but it works also over c, see [13, Théorème

4.5.3] or [72, §16].

5We refer to [13, Théorème 5.2.8] for a proof for U, which clearly implies the general statement.

1.7. A central subring. We have W × W ∗ ⊆ GL(h ⊕ h∗). This is clearly a
reﬂection group and we consider its invariant ring
= K[h ⊕ h∗]W×W ∗

B := K[h ⊕ h∗]W×W ∗

(25)

= K[h]W ⊗K K[h∗]W ∗

,

the so-called bi-invariants of W . We also consider its generic version

P := C ⊗K B = C[h ⊕ h∗]W×W ∗
For any geometric C-algebra c the c-algebra

= C[h]W ⊗K C[h∗]W ∗

.

Pc := c ⊗C P

(26)

(27)

is simply given by replacing C by c in (26). The following lemma is straightforward.
Lemma 1.17. Let V be a ﬁnite-dimensional K-vector space and let G ⊆ GL(V )
be a ﬁnite subgroup such that K[V ]G is a polynomial ring. Then for any subgroup
H of G the extension K[V ]G ⊆ K[V ]H is free of rank [G : H].
Proof. It is a standard fact that the extension K[V ]G ⊆ K[V ] is ﬁnite. Hence,
K[V ]G ⊆ K[V ]H must be ﬁnite. Since K[V ]G is polynomial, we thus deduce that it
is a graded Noether normalization of K[V ]H. As K[V ]H is graded Cohen–Macaulay
by the Eagon–Hochster theorem [31], see also [64, Theorem 5.5.2], it now follows from
[68, Corollary 6.7.7] that the extension K[V ]G ⊆ K[V ]H is already free. If K(V )
denotes the fraction ﬁeld of K[V ], then K(V )G = Frac(K[V ]G) by [11, Proposition
1.1.1] and the ﬁeld extension K(V )G ⊆ K(V ) is Galois with Galois group G. It
follows that the degree of the extension K(V )G ⊆ K(V )H = Frac(K[V ]H ) is equal
to [G : H]. Since we know that K[V ]G ⊆ K[V ]H is free, it follows that its degree is
equal to [G : H].

Lemma 1.18. The following holds:
(1) The extensions c[h]W ⊆ c[h] and c[h∗]W ⊆ c[h∗] are free of degree |W|.
(2) The extension Pc ⊆ c[h ⊕ h∗] is free of degree |W|2.
(3) The extension Pc ⊆ c[h ⊕ h∗]W is free of degree |W|.
Proof. We just need to prove the assertions for c = K, the general result follows by
extension to c. The ﬁrst and second assertion simply follow from the Chevalley–
Shephard–Todd theorem since W ⊆ GL(h) and W × W ∗ ⊆ GL(h⊕ h∗) are reﬂection
groups. The third assertion follows immediately from Lemma 1.17.
Theorem 1.19 (Etingof–Ginzburg, Gordon). The c-module isomorphism c[h ⊕
h∗] (cid:111) W → Hc restricts to an injective c-algebra morphism Pc (cid:44)→ Hc. Moreover:
∼−→ Hc and c[h ⊕ h∗]W ∼−→ Zc
(1) The c-module isomorphisms c[h ⊕ h∗] (cid:111) W
are isomorphisms of Pc-modules. We thus have the following commutative

(2) Hc is a free Pc-module of rank |W|3,
(3) Zc is a free Pc-module of rank |W|,
(4) dim Zc = dim c + 2 dim h.

Proof. The fact that Pc is a central subalgebra of Hc was proven by Etingof and
Ginzburg [32] for K = c = C. The proof given by Gordon [41] works word for
word for arbitrary c. Assertion (1) follows directly from the deﬁnition of the
isomorphisms in Theorem 1.6 and Corollary 1.14. Assertions (2) and (3) now follow
immediately from Lemma 1.18. Since Pc ⊆ Zc and Pc ⊆ c[h ⊕ h∗] are ﬁnite, we
have dim Zc = dim Pc = dim c[h ⊕ h∗] = dim c + 2 dim h, using the fact that c is
noetherian.

Remark 1.20. The commutative diagram in Theorem 1.19 illustrates that the
extension C[h⊕ h∗]W×W ∗ ⊆ Z deforms the extension C[h⊕ h∗]W×W ∗ ⊆ C[h⊕ h∗]W
over C. This, in a sense, is the starting point of the Calogero–Moser cells by
Bonnafé and Rouquier [13, 14].
Corollary 1.21. If c is Cohen–Macaulay (resp. Gorenstein), so is Zc.
Proof. Assume that c is Cohen–Macaulay. A noetherian commutative ring is Cohen–
Macaulay if and only if all its localizations in maximal ideals are Cohen–Macaulay.
It thus suﬃces to show that the localization (Zc)M is Cohen–Macaulay for every
maximal ideal M of Zc. Since Pc ⊆ Zc is ﬁnite, M contracts to a maximal ideal m
of Pc. Since c is Cohen–Macaulay by assumption and Pc is a polynomial ring over
c, also Pc is Cohen–Macaulay by [70, Tag 00ND], hence (Pc)m is Cohen–Macaulay.
Since Pc ⊆ Zc is free, also (Pc)m ⊆ (Zc)M is free, in particular faithfully ﬂat, and
now [25, Exercise 2.1.23] implies that (Zc)M is also Cohen–Macaulay. A similar
proof shows that Zc is Gorenstein if c is Gorenstein.

The following general lemma is the so-called Artin–Tate lemma. A proof can be

found in [30, Theorem 11.4].
Lemma 1.22 (Artin–Tate). Let R ⊆ C ⊆ A be rings and suppose that C is central
in A, A is ﬁnitely generated as an R-algebra, A is ﬁnitely generated as a C-module,
and A is noetherian. Then C is a ﬁnitely generated R-algebra.

Restricted rational Cherednik algebras

Corollary 1.23. Zc is a ﬁnitely generated c-algebra.
Proof. We apply the Artin–Tate lemma to the extension c ⊆ Zc ⊆ Hc. Since
c(cid:104)h ⊗ h∗(cid:105) (cid:111) W is a ﬁnitely generated c-algebra and Hc is a quotient thereof, also
Hc is a ﬁnitely generated c-algebra. Since Pc ⊆ Hc is ﬁnite and Pc ⊆ Zc by
Theorem 1.19, also Zc ⊆ Hc is ﬁnite. Finally, we know from Corollary 1.7 that Hc
is noetherian.

1.8. Symmetrizing trace. The following theorem is essentially due to Brown,
Gordon, and Stroppel [24, §3].6

Theorem 1.24 (Brown–Gordon–Stroppel). For any geometric C-algebra c the
rational Cherednik algebra Hc is a free symmetric Frobenius Pc-algebra.

We will give some more details about this, beginning with some general remarks.
First, recall that a commutative ﬁnite-dimensional N-graded connected7 algebra A
is called a Poincaré duality algebra if there is some N ∈ N such that
(1) Ai = 0 for all i > N.
(2) dimK AN = 1
(3) The pairing Ai ⊗ AN−i → AN induced by multiplication is non-degenerate

for all 0 ≤ i ≤ n.

Any non-zero element of the top-degree component AN is called a fundamental
class of A. The following lemma is elementary, see [72, Lemma 17.32] for a proof.
Lemma 1.25. Let Ω ∈ AN be a fundamental class of a Poincaré duality algebra
A. Then:
(1) The map ΦΩ : A → K mapping a to the coeﬃcient of Ω in the N-th homoge-

neous part of a makes A into a symmetric Frobenius K-algebra.

(2) Let X := (xi)n

degree and such that xn = Ω. Let X k
X k

respect to X , i.e., xixj = (cid:80)n
is invertible and if we deﬁne Y n := (X n)−1 and yj :=(cid:80)n

i=1 be a homogeneous basis of A which is sorted increasingly by
i,j be the structure constants of A with
i,j) ∈ Matn(K)
i,jxk. Then X n := (X n
k,jxk, then
Y n
i=1 is also a homogeneous basis of A with ΦΩ(xiyj) = δi,j, i.e., Y
Y := (yi)n
is the dual basis of X with respect to ΦΩ and this basis is in particular again
homogeneous.

k=1

and fundamental class given by Ω :=(cid:81)

It is a standard fact that the coinvariant algebra K[h]co(W ) of a reﬂection group
W ⊆ GL(h) is a Poincaré duality algebra with top degree being equal to # Ref(W )
s∈Ref(W ) αs, see [50, §20]. By Lemma 1.25
we thus have a symmetrizing trace ΦΩ : K[h]co(W ) → K and we know that it has
6In [24] this is proven over C but one can also give a completely general proof, see [72, §17D]

and the argumentation below.

7This means that the homogeneous component of A of degree zero is just equal to K.

a pair of homogeneous dual bases. Let Ω ∈ K[h] be a homogeneous lift of Ω. We
can now deﬁne a unique K[h]W -linear map ΦΩ : K[h] → K[h]W as follows: choose
any homogeneous K[h]W -basis X of K[h] containing Ω and deﬁne ΦΩ(f ) = δf,Ω
for f ∈ X . With the arguments in the proof of [24, Lemma 3.5], see also [72,
Proposition 17.33], one can now show the following.
Theorem 1.26 (Brown–Gordon–Stroppel). The extension K[h]W ⊆ K[h] is a free
symmetric Frobenius extension. A symmetrizing trace is given by ΦΩ.
Remark 1.27. We do not know if an arbitrary homogeneous lift of a pair of dual
bases for ΦΩ yields a pair of dual bases for ΦΩ. The argumentation in [24] uses a
rather ingenious condition for Frobenius extensions, [24, Proposition 2.2], which,
however, has the drawback of not giving an explicit dual basis.

By scalar extension we see that c[h]W ⊆ c[h] is a free symmetric Frobenius
extension with symmetrizing trace ΦΩ,c := c ⊗K ΦΩ for any geometric C-algebra c.
Similar statements hold of course also for the dual representation of W , so K[h∗]co(W )
is a Poincaré duality algebra and a homogeneous lift Ω∗ of a fundamental class
Ω∗ of K[h∗]co(W ) yields a symmetrizing trace ΦΩ∗,c : c[h∗] → c[h∗]W for the free
symmetric Frobenius extension c[h∗]W ⊆ c[h].

As a last ingredient for Theorem 1.24 recall that the group algebra KW is a
symmetric Frobenius K-algebra with symmetrizing trace ΦW deﬁned by ΦW (w) :=
δw,1 for w ∈ W . By scalar extension we get a symmetrizing trace ΦW,c : cW → c.
We can now patch the three symmetrizing traces ΦΩ,c, ΦΩ∗,c, and ΦW,c into
one symmetrizing trace ΦΩ,Ω∗,c : Hc → Pc as follows: we choose a homogeneous
K[h]W -basis X of K[h] containing Ω and a homogeneous K[h∗]W -basis Y of K[h∗]
containing Ω∗, then by the PBW theorem (f gw)f∈X ,g∈Y ,w∈W is a Pc-basis of Hc
and we deﬁne

ΦΩ,Ω,c(f gw) := ΦΩ,c(f )ΦΩ∗,c(g)ΦW,c(w) = δf,Ωδg,Ω∗ δw,1 .

(28)

A more precise form of Theorem 1.24 is now:

Theorem 1.28 (Brown–Gordon–Stroppel). The map ΦΩ,Ω∗,c is a symmetrizing
trace for the Pc-algebra Hc. Moreover, if X ∨ is a dual basis of X with respect to
ΦΩ and Y ∨ is a dual basis of Y with respect to ΦΩ∗, then for f ∈ X , g ∈ Y , and
w ∈ W the dual element of f gw with respect to ΦΩ,Ω∗,c is given by

(f gw)∨ = w−1g∨f∨ .

(29)
Remark 1.29. Even though a dual basis is given in [24, Corollary 3.7]8, it seems
that the arguments given there do not prove this. The problem here is the use of
the condition in [24, Proposition 2.2] which does not give a dual basis. One can,
however, rearrange the arguments in the proof of [24, Proposition 3.5] as follows:
ﬁrst, one shows that ΦΩ,Ω∗,c is symmetric and then one can verify directly that (29)
is a dual basis. This is done in [72, Theorem 17.36]. We think that the approach
of ﬁrst proving symmetry may also yield to further simpliﬁcations in [24] for the
cases of symmetric Frobenius extensions.
8Note that there is a typo in the dual basis.

1.9. Geometry and representation theory. The ﬁniteness of Hc over its center
Zc has a lot of implications for the representation theory of Hc and connects it
to the geometry of the spectrum of Zc. For any geometric C-algebra c we call
Xc := Z(cid:92)
c = Spec(Zc) the Calogero–Moser space in c. By the results above this is
an integral c-scheme of ﬁnite type. The morphism Υc : Xc → P(cid:92)
c induced by the
embedding Pc (cid:44)→ Zc is ﬁnite, ﬂat, surjective, and closed. We call X := XC = Spec(Z)
the generic Calogero–Moser space and set Υ := ΥC.

First of all, the ﬁniteness of Hc over its center immediately implies:
Lemma 1.30. The ring Hc is a PI ring for any geometric C-algebra c.

A consequence is:

Lemma 1.31. Let c be a geometric C-algebra. Let S ∈ Irr Hc. Then

AnnHc (S) ∈ Max(Hc) , AnnZc (S) ∈ Max(Zc) , AnnPc(S) ∈ Max(Pc) .

Hence, there is a natural decomposition

Irr Hc =

Irr Hc/pHc =

(cid:97)

p∈Max(Pc)

(cid:97)

m∈Υ−1
c (p)
p∈Max(Pc)

Irr Hc/mHc ,

(30)

the second reﬁning the ﬁrst.
Proof. An annihilator P := AnnHc(S) of a simple module S ∈ Irr Hc is by deﬁnition
a left primitive ideal of Hc. The quotient Hc/P is a primitive PI ring (primitive
following from P being primitive and PI following from the fact that quotients of PI
rings are again PI). An application of Kaplansky’s theorem [61, 13.3.8] now implies
that Hc/P is a central simple algebra over its center, thus in particular simple and
so P has to be maximal. That AnnZc(S) and AnnPc(S) are also maximal follows
now from the fact that the extensions Zc ⊆ Hc and Pc ⊆ Zc are ﬁnite and thus
satisfy going up for prime ideals.

The decomposition (30) shows that to describe the simple Hc-modules, it is

suﬃcient to describe the simple modules for the restrictions

Hp

c := Hc/pHc

(31)

in maximal ideals p of Pc. Note that Hp
c is a ﬁnite-dimensional algebra over the
ﬁeld Pc/p, and it is even ﬁnite-dimensional over K if c is of ﬁnite type over K, e.g.
c = C or c = K. We want to give an interpretation of the set-theoretic ﬁber Υ−1
c (p).
Since Hp
c is a ﬁnite-dimensional algebra over a ﬁeld, it has a block decomposition.
We denote the set of its blocks by Bl(Hp

c ). Furthermore, we deﬁne

Zp

for p ∈ Max(Pc). We have a natural morphism Zp

and an application of this to the ﬁnite free extension Pc ⊆ Hc yields:
Theorem 1.32. Let c be a geometric C-algebra and let p ∈ Max(Pc). There is a

We can now state the following striking theorem.

Theorem 1.33 (Etingof–Ginzburg, Brown–Goodearl, Brown). Suppose that K
is algebraically closed and that c ∈ C , i.e., c is a closed point of C(cid:92). Then the
PI-degree of Hc is equal to |W|, so dimK S ≤ |W| for any S ∈ Irr Hc. Moreover,
setting mS := AnnZc(S) and pS := AnnPc(S), the following are equivalent:

(1) mS is a smooth point of Xc.
(2) dimK S = |W|.

Proof. The implication (1) ⇒ (2) follows from the result [32, Theorem 1.7(iv)] by
Etingof and Ginzburg. An application of a result by Brown and Goodearl [21,
Lemma 3.3] shows that the (dense) Azumaya locus is contained in the smooth
locus of Xc. The Azumaya locus is the locus over which simple Hc-modules have
maximal dimension, and this maximal dimension is equal to the PI-degree of Hc.
Hence, the maximal dimension, and thus the PI-degree, is equal to |W|. This
furthermore proves the implication (2) ⇒ (1). The implication (3) ⇒ (2) is obvious,
and the implication (1) ⇒ (3) was shown by Etingof and Ginzburg in [32, Theorem
1.7(iv)]. Suppose that dimK S = |W| and let M := AnnHc(S). We already know
that the PI-degree of Hc is equal to |W|, so it follows from [22, Theorem III.1.6]
that Hc/M (cid:39) Mat|W|(K) and that M = mSHc. Hence, there is only one simple
Hc-module lying over M and there is only one maximal ideal of Hc lying over mS.
Consequently, there is only one simple Hc-module lying over mS. Now, it follows
from Theorem 1.32 that in the block of HpS
containing S the is up to isomorphism
no other simple module. This proves the implication (2) ⇒ (4). The converse of
c
this implication is due to Brown and appeared in [41, Lemma 7.2] by Gordon.

We do not know to which extend Theorem 1.33 can be generalized to arbitrary
ﬁelds K and geometric C-algebras c. At least we can show that the result about
the PI-degree holds in general:
Theorem 1.34. The PI-degree of Hc is equal to |W| for any geometric C-algebra c.
Proof. Recall from Corollary 1.7 that Hc is prime and from Corollary 1.14 that Zc is
an integral domain. Let Ec be the fraction ﬁeld of Pc and let Fc be the fraction ﬁeld
of Zc. By Posner’s theorem, see [61, Theorem 13.6.5], the set of non-zero central
elements in Hc is an Ore set so that the localization Qc := (Zc\{0})−1Hc = Fc⊗ZcHc
exists. By [61, 13.3.6], Kaplansky’s theorem [61, Theorem 13.3.8], Posner’s theorem,
and [61, 13.6.7] we have

PI-deg(Hc) = PI-deg(Qc) =(cid:112)dimFc Qc .

(34)

Since Hc is a free Pc-module of rank |W|3 by Theorem 1.19, it follows that

dimEc(Ec ⊗Pc Hc) = |W|3 .

Similarly, since Zc is a free Pc-module of rank |W| by Theorem 1.19, it follows that

dimEc Fc = |W| .

Furthermore, we have

Ec ⊗Pc Hc = (Pc \ {0})−1Hc ⊆ (Zc \ {0})−1Hc = Fc ⊗Zc Hc = Qc .

Hence,

and therefore

|W|3 = dimEc(Ec ⊗Pc Hc) ≤ dimEc Qc = |W| · dimFc Qc

PI-deg(Hc) =(cid:112)dimFc Qc ≥(cid:112)|W|2 = |W| .

20

Now, let

Ulrich Thiel

PIGen(H) := {P ∈ Spec(H) | PI-deg(H/P) = PI-deg(H)} ⊆ Spec(H) .

This set contains the zero ideal (recall that H is prime) and therefore it is dense in
Spec(H). Let f : Spec(H) → Spec(P) be the morphism induced by the inclusion
P (cid:44)→ H. This morphism is ﬁnite, thus surjective by [61, Theorem 10.2.9]. Hence,
the image f (PIGen(H)) is dense in Spec(P). Since Spec(P) is just an aﬃne space,
the K-points are dense in Spec(P), see also [17, Corollary III.18.3], and so there
is a K-point m in f (PIGen(H)). Since P(K) = C × (h/W × h∗/W )(K), the point
m corresponds to a point (c, p). Since f is surjective, there is some P ∈ PIGen(H)
with f (P) = m. Now, H/P is a quotient of H/mH and H/mH is a quotient of Hc,
so it follows that
PI-deg(H) = PI-deg(H/P) ≤ PI-deg(H/mH) ≤ PI-deg(Hc) ≤ PI-deg(C ⊗K Hc) ,
the last inequality following from the fact that Hc ⊆ HC
c = C⊗K Hc. From Theorem
c ) ≤ |W|, so this shows us that PI-deg(H) ≤ |W|. If c
1.33 we know that PI-deg(HC
is any geometric C-algebra, then Hc is a (central) localization of a quotient of H, so

PI-deg(Hc) ≤ PI-deg(H) ≤ |W| .

by [22, Corollary I.13.3] which states that subrings of the fraction ﬁeld of a prime
PI ring have the same PI-degree as this ring. Combined with the inequality above,
we get PI-deg(Hc) = |W|.

Proof. The implication (2) ⇒ (3) is obvious by Lemma C.1. Let m1, . . . , mr be the
maximal ideals of Zc lying over p. We will make use of the general ring theoretic
fact that if e is an idempotent of a ring A, then A is Morita equivalent to eAe if
and only if A = AeA.

Suppose that (1) holds. Then for each i there is only one maximal ideal Mi of
Hc lying over mi. It thus follows from Müller’s theorem [49, Theorem A.2.2] that
each Mi is localizable and that the localization (Hc)Mi is equal to the localization
of Hc in the multiplicative set Zc \ mi, which is just the localization (Hc)mi of the
Zc-module Hc in mi. The proof of [41, Lemma 7.2]9 shows that (Hc)mi is Morita
equivalent to e(Hc)mie. This implies that (Hc)mi = (Hc)mie(Hc)mi = (HceHc)mi.
Reduction in p yields (Hp

Zc/pZc, this shows that Hp

the implication (1) ⇒ (2).

Now, suppose that (3) holds. Assume that (1) were not be true, i.e., the

∼→ eHce by Lemma C.2. Reduction
multiplication with e yields an isomorphism Zc
ce. This implies in particular that the dimension
in p gives an isomorphism Zp
c
of these two ﬁnite-dimensional (Pc/p)-vector spaces is equal. We know from
Theorem 1.19 that Zc is a free Pc-module. For any i we thus get a ﬂat morphism
(Pc)p → (Zc)mi of noetherian local rings. By Corollary 1.21 the center Zc is
Gorenstein, hence (Zc)mi is Gorenstein and now [25, 3.3.15] shows that (Zp
c )mi =
(Zc/pZc)mi is Gorenstein. This implies that Zp
c itself is Gorenstein. As this ring
is artinian and thus zero-dimensional, it must be self-injective. The canonical
morphism Zp

module by Lemma 1.16. By assumption, there is a block of Hp
c containing more
than one simple module and so [40, 2.8 and 2.9] shows that the injective morphism
c → Z(Hp

c is a symmetric

C-algebra c. In general, assume that p ∈ B(cid:92)(K) = (h/W )(K) × (h∗/W )(K) is a
K-point. Considered as a maximal ideal in B this generates for any geometric
C-algebra c a prime ideal in Pc = c ⊗K B with quotient Pc/pPc = c, so this is a
maximal ideal in Pc if and only if c is a ﬁeld. But even if p is not a maximal ideal
in Pc, we can still deﬁne the restrictions

Hp

c := Hc/pHc , Zp

c := Zc/pZc , Up

c := Uc/pUc

(37)

as before. These are all naturally c-algebras. In particular, for c = C we get generic
versions

Hp := H/pH , Zp := Z/pZ , Up := U/pU

(38)
of these restrictions. These are C-algebras, so we can consider their scalar extensions
to geometric C-algebras c. This is compatible with the former construction, i.e.,
(Hp)c = c ⊗C Hp = Hp
c ,

c . (39)
There seems to be only one particular point of h/W × h∗/W which is naturally
deﬁned for any complex reﬂection group W , namely the origin 0 := (0, 0). The
corresponding maximal ideal of B is given by

(Zp)c = c ⊗C Zp = Zp
c ,

(Up)c = c ⊗C Up = Up

+ K[h∗]W + K[h∗]W

K[h]W

(40)
where (−)+ denotes the ideal generated by the invariants with non-zero constant
term (the augmentation ideal with respect to the natural N-grading on the invariant
rings). It is generated by one (any) system of fundamental invariants of K[h]W and
of K[h∗]W . For a geometric C-algebra c we set:

+ K[h]W ,

Hc := H0

c , Zc := Z0

c , Uc := U0

c

(41)

and

H := H0 , Z := Z0 , U := U0

(42)
for their generic versions. We call Hc the restricted rational Cherednik algebra in c.
To make this clear: Hc is simply the c-algebra with presentation as in Deﬁnition
1.4 (with c(s) replaced by its image in c) where we additionally mod out a system
of fundamental invariants for K[h]W and for K[h∗]W .

2.1. Grading. The ideal in (40) is clearly a homogeneous ideal of B with respect
to the Z-grading. Hence, the quotient Hc is naturally Z-graded.

2.2. Triangular decomposition. Recall that the coinvariant algebra of W is
the quotient

K[h]co(W ) := K[h]/K[h]W

(43)
The action of W makes this into a graded W -module and it is a classical fact that
it is isomorphic to the regular W -module KW . We can extend the coinvariant
algebra to any geometric C-algebra c, this just amounts to replacing K by c in (43).
The same is of course true for the dual coinvariant algebra K[h∗]co(W ).

Corollary 2.1. The c-module isomorphism Hc (cid:39) c[h⊕h∗](cid:111)W (cid:39) c[h]⊗c cW ⊗c c[h∗]
from the PBW theorem (Theorem 1.6) induces a c-module isomorphism

Hc (cid:39) c[h]co(W ) ⊗c cW ⊗c c[h∗]co(W ) .

(44)

This isomorphism respects the ﬁltration and all deﬁned gradings. In particular, Hc
is a free c-module with

dimc Hc = |W|3 .

(45)

2.3. Automorphisms. The following point of view is due to Bonnafé and Rouquier
[13, §4.6]. Let AutK(H) be the group of K-algebra automorphisms of H. The
(N × N)-grading on H induces a natural group morphism
bigr : K× × K× → AutK(H)

(46)

given by

(47)
for (ξ, ξ(cid:48)) ∈ K× × K× and (N × N)-homogeneous h ∈ H of degree (i, j). Explicitly,
we have

bigrξ,ξ(cid:48)(h) = ξiξ(cid:48)jh

bigrξ,ξ(cid:48)(x) = ξ(cid:48)x,

bigrξ,ξ(cid:48)(f ) = ξξ(cid:48)f,

bigrξ,ξ(cid:48)(y) = ξy,

bigrξ,ξ(cid:48)(w) = w (48)
for y ∈ h, x ∈ h∗, f ∈ C ∗, and w ∈ W . The action of bigrξ,1 on C ∗ is just the
natural action of K× on the K-vector space C ∗. This naturally induces a K×-action
on C. If c is a geometric C-algebra and ξ ∈ K×, we denote by ξc the geometric
C-algebra obtained by twisting the C-action with the automorphism deﬁned by ξ on
C. The K-algebra automorphism bigrξ,1 of H then yields a K-algebra isomorphism

(49)
The automorphism bigrξ,1 stabilizes the origin 0 of h/W × h∗/W , so it induces a
K-algebra automorphism of H and a K-algebra isomorphism

2.4. Symmetrizing trace. As a special case of Corollary 1.35 we obtain:

Corollary 2.2. For any geometric C-algebra c the restricted rational Cherednik
algebra Hc is a free symmetric Frobenius c-algebra.

2.5. Baby Verma modules. The triangular decomposition in (44) implies a rich
combinatorial structure for the representation theory of Hc. This was discovered
by Gordon [41], using a general theory of Holmes and Nakano [48]. We will now go
through this theory applied to restricted rational Cherednik algebras and refer to
[48] for further aspects of the abstract setting. We note that there are some recent
developments by Bellamy and the author [9] in the abstract setting with applications

24

Ulrich Thiel

to restricted rational Cherednik algebras on which we can comment here only brieﬂy.

We assume throughout that c is a prime ideal of C. From the deﬁning relations of
Hc it is clear that the vector space isomorphism above embeds both kC(c)[h]co(W ) (cid:111)
W and kC(c)[h∗]co(W ) (cid:111) W into Hc as graded subalgebras. In particular, all three
algebras in the triangular decomposition are naturally graded subalgebras of Hc:

(cid:125)
Hc (cid:39) kC(c)[h]co(W ) ⊗kC(c) kC(c)W ⊗kC(c) kC(c)[h∗]co(W )

(cid:123)(cid:122)

(cid:124)

(cid:39)kC(c)[h∗]co(W )(cid:111)W

.

(51)

We will consider them with the induced Z-grading. By deﬁnition, kC(c)[h]co(W ) is
concentrated in non-negative degree, the group algebra kC(c)W is concentrated
in degree zero, and kC(c)[h∗]co(W ) is concentrated in non-positive degree. Let
kC(c)[h∗]co(W )
be the ideal of kC(c)[h∗]co(W ) formed by the elements of nega-
tive degree.10 The group algebra kC(c)W is clearly the (graded) quotient of
kC(c)[h∗]co(W ) (cid:111) W by kC(c)[h∗]co(W )
. Hence, we can consider any kC(c)W -module
naturally as a kC(c)[h∗]co(W ) (cid:111) W -module by inﬂation, i.e., kC(c)[h∗]co(W )
acts
trivially. We thus have a sequece of functors

Here, we used the classical fact that KW splits already over K due to a theorem
by Benard [10] and Bessis [12], so KW -mod (cid:39) kC(c)W -mod naturally via scalar
extension. We denote the composition of the functors above by ∆c. To summarize,
we have

∆c(M ) := Hc ⊗kC(c)[h∗]co(W )(cid:111)W M .

(53)
for a KW -module M. This is the so-called baby Verma module associated to M.11
Theorem 2.3 (Holmes–Nakano, Gordon). If λ ∈ Irr W , then ∆c(λ) has a simple
head, i.e.,

(54)
is a simple Hc-module. Furthermore, the map λ (cid:55)→ Lc(λ) induces a bijection between
the sets of isomorphism classes of simple modules.

Lc(λ) := ∆c(λ)/ Rad ∆c(λ)

In [48] an algebraically closed base ﬁeld is assumed but everything still works

over an arbitrary ﬁeld, see [9]. Particularly useful is the following result.

10If we consider kC(c)[h∗]co(W ) with the natural N-grading, this is the augmentation ideal
kC(c)[h∗]co(W )
11We note that Gordon [41] uses ∆c(M ) = Hc ⊗kC(c)[h]co(W )(cid:111)W M. The results one gets are
essentially the same “up to twist”. We follow [13, §9.2] here and refer to [9] for comments on the
two possible ways to deﬁne Verma modules.

. This is a bit confusing but consistent with the current context.

25

Proposition 2.4 (Bonnafé–Rouquier). Each Lc(λ) is absolutely simple, i.e., it
remains simple under any ﬁeld extension. In particular, the kC(c)-algebra Hc splits.
The parametrization of the simple Hc-modules by the simple W -modules allows
us to attach the following important invariant to W , which was introduced by
Gordon [41]. Namely, since the block structure of Hc partitions the set Irr Hc into
families we can pull back this partition along the map Irr W → Irr Hc, λ (cid:55)→ Lc(λ),
and in this way we get a c-dependent partition of Irr W into so-called Calogero–
Moser c-families. We denote this partition by CMc. Recall from Theorem 1.32 that
we have a canonical bijection

CMc (cid:39) Υ−1

c (0) .

(55)

Let us take a closer look at baby Verma modules. By construction, the baby
Verma module is naturally graded. The radical of ∆c(λ) is a graded submodule,
so Lc(λ) is naturally graded, too. It is a standard fact that the graded simple
modules, i.e., the simple objects in the graded module category Hc-grmod, are
simply the shifts Lc(λ)[n] for n ∈ Z. The graded module category Hc-grmod is
an abelian category of ﬁnite length. In particular, the graded Grothendieck group
0 (Hc) := K0(Hc-grmod) is deﬁned. By the aforementioned, Ggr
0 (Hc) is a free
Ggr
module of rank # Irr W over the Laurent polynomial ring Z[q, q−1], while the non-
graded Grothendieck group G0(Hc) := K0(Hc-mod) is a free Z-module of the same
rank. Directly from the deﬁnition we obtain:

Lemma 2.5. There is a canonical isomorphism

∆c(λ) (cid:39) kC(c)[h]co(W ) ⊗c λ

(56)

of graded kC(c)W -modules.

In particular, ∆c(λ) is concentrated in non-negative degree. Recall that the
coinvariant algebra is as a W -module just the regular module, so from Lemma 2.5
we get an isomorphism

(57)
of non-graded kC(c)W -modules. To give a further structural result, ﬁrst recall that
the fake degree fχ of an irreducible character χ ∈ Irr W is deﬁned as the graded
multiplicity of χ∗ in the coinvariant algebra K[h]co(W ), so:

∆c(λ) (cid:39) kC(c)W ⊗c λ

fχ := [K[h]co(W ) : χ∗]gr
W .

(58)

It follows from Molien’s formula that the fake degree is given by the following
explicit formula:

(1 − qdi)

1
|W|

χ∗(w)

det(1 − wq)

∈ N[q] ,

(59)

fχ(q) =

(cid:88)

w∈W

where d1, . . . , dn are the degrees of W , i.e., the degrees of one (any) system of
fundamental invariants of K[h]W . From this formula it is easy to see that fχ is

26

Ulrich Thiel

equal to the graded multiplicity of χ in the dual coinvariant algebra K[h∗]co(W ).
Note that the above formula can be simpliﬁed to a summation over the conjugacy
classes of W and is thus easy to compute.

Corollary 2.6. The graded W -module character of ∆c(λ) is given by

The next lemma is elementary (see [9] for a proof).

Lemma 2.7. The baby Verma module ∆c(λ) is generated by any non-zero element
in degree zero. Moreover, λ (cid:39) Lc(λ)0 (cid:39) ∆c(λ)0 as kC(c)W -modules.

The following result is proven in [9].

Proposition 2.8 (Bellamy–T.). The restriction map Ggr
by the embedding KW (cid:44)→ Hc is injective.

0 (Hc) → Ggr

0 (KW ) induced

The reader might want to take a look at [9] for several implications of Proposition

2.8. We note that it does not hold in the non-graded case.

12This formula is also given in [41]. But note that this looks slightly diﬀerent as the deﬁnition

of the baby Verma module in loc. cit. is dual to ours.

Restricted rational Cherednik algebras

Lemma 2.9. The matrix

A := ([Lc(µ) : η])gr

W )µ,η∈Irr W ∈ Mat# Irr W (Q(q))

is invertible. Moreover, if we deﬁne for λ ∈ Irr W the vector

(cid:88)

vλ := (

fµ(q)[µ∗ ⊗ λ : η])η∈Irr W ∈ Q(q)Irr W ,

then the unique wλ ∈ Q(q)Irr W with vλ = Awλ is given by

wλ = ([∆c(λ) : Lc(µ)]gr)µ∈Irr W ∈ Q(q)Irr W .

In other words, knowing the graded W -module structure of the simple Hc-modules is
equivalent to knowing the graded decomposition matrices of the baby Verma modules
of Hc by solving a system of linear equations over Q(q).
0 (Hc) is a free Z[q, q−1]-module with basis (Lc(η))η∈Irr W and
Proof. Recall that Ggr
0 (KW ) is a free Z[q, q−1]-module with basis (η)η∈Irr W . Due to the
that similarly Ggr
0 (KW ) by Proposition 2.8, it
injectivity of the restriction map χ : Ggr
0 (KW ).
follows that the image (χ(Lc(η)))η∈Irr W is a linearly independent subset of Ggr
Extending scalars to Q(q) we thus get two bases of Q(q) ⊗Z[q,q−1] Ggr
0 (KW ) and
the matrix A is simply the base change matrix, thus invertible. The vector vλ just
corresponds to the representation of [∆c(λ)] in the basis (η)η∈Irr W by Corollary 2.6,
and base change with A−1 gives the representation in the basis (Lc(η))η∈Irr W .
Remark 2.10. Corollary 2.9 can of course also be restricted to a single block B
of Hc resulting in a linear system over Q(q)|Irr B|.

0 (Hc) → Ggr

Recall the K-algebra isomorphism Hc → Hξc for ξ ∈ K× from (50). This

induces an equivalence of categories

ξ(−) : Hξc-(gr)mod

∼−→ Hc-(gr)mod .

(64)

By deﬁnition, see (48), the isomorphism induces the identity on the group algebras.
More precisely, the diagram

Proof. As explained above, the graded W -module structures of ξ∆ξc(λ) and ∆c(λ)
coincide. The graded W -modules structure of a baby Verma module is, inde-
pendently of c, always given by (60) in Lemma 2.6. Hence, ξ∆ξc(λ) is a graded
Hc-module which has the same graded W -module structure as ∆c(λ). The ﬁrst
assertion thus follows from Proposition 2.8. We have an exact sequence

0 → Rad(∆ξc(λ)) → ∆ξc(λ) → Lξc(λ) → 0

and since ξ(−) is exact, this induces an exact sequence

0 → ξ Rad(∆ξc(λ)) → ξ∆ξc(λ) → ξLξc(λ) → 0 .

Since ξLξc(λ) is simple, we must have ξLξc(λ) = Lc(µ) for some µ. The sequence
above induces an exact sequence

0 → ( ξ Rad(∆ξc(λ)))0 → ( ξ∆ξc(λ))0 → ( ξLξc(λ))0 → 0

of the degree zero components as W -modules. By Lemma 2.7 and the fact
that ξ∆ξc(λ) and ∆c(λ) are isomorphic as graded W -modules, we know that
( ξ∆ξc(λ))0 (cid:39) (∆c(λ))0 (cid:39) λ and ( ξLξc(λ))0 (cid:39) Lc(µ)0 (cid:39) µ. Hence, the above
sequence shows that there exists a surjective W -module morphism λ (cid:16) µ. This is
only possible if λ (cid:39) µ, i.e., ξLξc(λ) (cid:39) Lc(λ).

Bonnafé and Rouquier [13, Proposition 13.4.2] have proven an astonishing
property of the non-graded decomposition matrices of baby Verma modules. We
cannot go into details here about the proof but note that this is a consequence of
the Calogero–Moser cell theory developed in [13].
Theorem 2.12 (Bonnafé–Rouquier). For every ﬁxed Calogero–Moser c-family F
there is an Hc-module Lc(F) such that

[∆c(λ)] = dim λ · [Lc(F)]

(67)

in G0(Hc) for all λ ∈ F.

There are two immediate consequences:

Corollary 2.13. Let λ, µ ∈ Irr W . Then [∆c(λ) : Lc(µ)] is a multiple of dim λ.
Corollary 2.14. If λ, µ ∈ Irr W lie in the same Calogero–Moser c-family, then

dim µ [∆c(λ) : Lc(η)] = dim λ [∆c(µ) : Lc(η)]

(68)

Restricted rational Cherednik algebras

29

in G0(Hc) for all η ∈ Irr W . In particular the decomposition matrix of baby Verma
modules for a ﬁxed Calogero–Moser family is of rank 1 and

dim µ
dim λ

[∆c(λ) : Lc(λ)] = [∆c(µ) : Lc(λ)] ,

(69)

so once we know the diagonal of the decomposition matrix, we know the whole
decomposition matrix!

2.6. Main problem. The main problem about restricted rational Cherednik
algebras is now the following:
Problem 2.15. Determine for any c ∈ C and any λ ∈ Irr W the graded decompo-
sition of ∆c(λ) into the simple modules Lc(µ), µ ∈ Irr W .

We have seen in Lemma 2.9 that this is equivalent to the following problem:
Problem 2.16. Determine for any c ∈ C and any λ ∈ Irr W the graded W -module
character of Lc(λ).

It is a consequence of Corollary 2.14 that this problem already gives the solution

to the following:
Problem 2.17. Determine the Calogero–Moser c-families for any c ∈ C .

It is clear that our main problem furthermore gives the solutions to the following

sub-problems:
Problem 2.18. Determine for any c ∈ C and λ ∈ Irr W :
(1) The dimension of Lc(λ).
(2) The Poincaré series of Lc(λ).
(3) The W -module structure of Lc(λ).
(4) The decomposition of ∆c(λ) into the simple modules Lc(µ), µ ∈ Irr W .

3. Generic representation theory
The main problems in Section 2.6 are posed for arbitrary parameters c ∈ C . In this
chapter we want to show how one can reduce this to a ﬁnite problem by taking
non-closed points of C(cid:92) into account. This framework allows us to introduce the two
“genericity loci” DecGen(H) and BlGen(H), which should be considered as additional
invariants of W and play an important in understanding the representation theory
of Hc for arbitrary c.

3.1. Decomposition maps. Let c be a prime ideal of C. Let us deﬁne

H|c := H/cH .

(70)

This is a (C/c)-algebra which is free and ﬁnitely generated as a (C/c)-module.
We can identify the spectrum of C/c with the zero locus V(c) of c in C(cid:92) and the
specialization of H|c in a point c ∈ V(c) is precisely Hc. As an example, we can
take c = • to be the generic point deﬁned by the zero ideal in which case we have
H|• = H.
From now on, we assume that C/c is normal.13 The theory of decomposition
maps by Geck and Rouquier [35] (see also [36] and [74]) shows that for any c ∈ V(c)
there is a morphism

(71)

uniquely characterized by the equation

: G0(Hc) → G0(Hc)

dc
H|c

[V ] = [(cid:101)V /m(cid:101)V ]

dc
H|c

for any ﬁnite-dimensional Hc-module V and any O-free OH|c-form (cid:101)V of V for

any valuation ring O in C/c whose maximal ideal m lies above c. Here, we use
that Hc splits by Proposition 2.4 so that we can identify G0(Hc) (cid:39) G0(kO(m)Hc).
This morphism generalizes reduction of modules in c. In [74, Theorem 1.22] we
have shown that it is always possible to use a discrete valuation ring O for the
construction of dc

, where we use the fact that C/c is noetherian.

(72)

It is possible to reﬁne the decomposition map to work with graded modules.
This has been done in a general setting by Chlouveraki and Jacon [28]. We thus
have a morphism

H|c

which is similarly uniquely characterized as dc
By construction, this map is compatible with shifts, i.e.,

dc,gr
H|c

: Ggr

0 (Hc) → Ggr
H|c

0 (Hc)
, but this time for graded modules.

(73)

dc,gr
H|c

([V [m]]) = dc,gr
H|c

([V ])[m] ,

and it ﬁts into the commutative diagram

(74)

(75)

where the vertical morphisms are obtained by forgetting about the grading.

In the following we use the notation “(gr)” to signify that we can work with
graded or non-graded modules. Recall that G0(Hc) is a free Z-module and that
13This assumption is only needed to ensure uniquely characterized decomposition maps in the

following. We do not know if this assumption can actually be removed.

Restricted rational Cherednik algebras

31

0 (Hc) is a free Z[q, q−1]-module, both having the classes of the simple modules
Ggr
Lc(λ), λ ∈ Irr W , as basis. We call the matrix of dc,(gr)
in such a standard basis the
H|c
(graded) decomposition matrix of H|c in c and denote it by Dc,(gr)
. It is of course
H|c
only unique up to rearranging the bases. An interesting property we immediately
obtain from Theorem 2.3 is:
Lemma 3.1. For any c ∈ V(c) the decomposition matrix Dc,(gr)
H|c

is a square matrix.

For the deﬁnition of the baby Verma modules (53) we actually do not need to
work over a ﬁeld. We can equally well deﬁne the generic baby Verma module for
H|c as

(76)
attached to a KW -module M. This is easily seen to be a (C/c)-free H|c-form of
∆c(λ) and we get

H|c ⊗(C/c)[h∗]co(W )(cid:111)W M

dc,(gr)
H|c

([∆c(λ)]) = [∆c(λ)] .

(77)

An application of Lemma D.1 now shows:

Lemma 3.2. Let c ∈ V(c). Then for any λ ∈ Irr W the simple module Lc(λ) is a
constituent of dc,(gr)

([Lc(λ)]). In particular, dimkC(c) Lc(λ) ≤ dimkC(c) Lc(λ).

H|c

The group algebra kC(c)W is a (graded) subalgebra of Hc. In the same way as

above we also have a decomposition map

dc,(gr)
(C/c)W : G(gr)

0

(kC(c)W ) → G(gr)

0

(kC(c)W )

(78)

for both graded and nongraded modules over the group algebra of W over C/c.
It is clear that any O-free OH|c-form of a ﬁnite-dimensional Hc-module is at the
same time also an O-free OW -form, so the diagram

0 (Hc)

dc,(gr)
H|c

G(gr)

0

(kC(c)W )

dc,(gr)

(kC(c)W )

(79)

commutes. Now, remember that KW splits. This implies that any ﬁnite-dimensional
kC(c)W -module actually has a KW -form. The extension of a KW -form to
O is clearly an O-free OW -form and reduction in the maximal ideal m of O
does not change anything.
In other words, together with the isomorphisms
G(gr)
(kC(c)W ) given by scalar
extension, diagram (79) collapses to the commutative diagram

(kC(c)W ) and G(gr)

This simply means:

Lemma 3.3. The decomposition map dc,(gr)
structure.

H|c

preserves the (graded) W -module

Recall from Proposition 2.8 that the restriction maps to the graded Grothendieck

group of KW in diagram (80) are injective.
Lemma 3.4. For any c ∈ V(c) the following are equivalent:
(1) dc

([Lc(λ)]) = [Lc(λ)] for all λ ∈ Irr W .

H|c
(2) Dc

H|c

(3) dc,(gr)

H|c

is the identity matrix (up to row and column permutation).
([Lc(λ)]) = [Lc(λ)] for all λ ∈ Irr W .

H|c

is the identity matrix (up to row and column permutation).

(4) Dc,(gr)
Proof. The equivalences (1) ⇔ (2) and (3) ⇔ (4) are obvious. By Corollary 3.2,
properties (1) and (3) are equivalent to dimkC(c) Lc(λ) = dimkC(c) Lc(λ) for all λ.
These two assertions are thus clearly equivalent.

Deﬁnition 3.5. We say that dc
3.4. We deﬁne

H|c

is trivial if it satisﬁes the conditions in Lemma

DecGen(H|c) := {c ∈ V(c) | dc
H|c

is trivial}

and

DecEx(H|c) := V(c) \ DecGen(H|c) .

(81)

(82)

From Lemma 3.3 we immediately obtain:

Lemma 3.6. If c ∈ DecGen(H|c), then for all λ ∈ Irr(W ) we have:
(1) The graded W -module structures of Lc(λ) and Lc(λ) are identical for all

λ ∈ Irr W . In particular, their Poincaré series and dimensions coincide.

(2) The graded decomposition numbers of ∆c(λ) and ∆c(λ) into simple modules

are identical.

Theorem 3.7. The set DecGen(H|c) is a non-empty open subset of V(c). It is
K×-stable if V(c) is K×-stable, e.g., if c = •. Moreover,

c ∈ DecGen(H|c) if and only if dimkC(c) Rad Hc = dimkC(c) Rad Hc .

(83)
Proof. We can apply [74, Theorem 2.3] to H|c and this shows that DecGen(H|c) is
a non-empty open subset of V(c) = Spec(C/c). The stability under K× follows
from Lemma 2.11. The last assertion is [74, Theorem 2.2].

The following is a reﬁnement of Theorem 3.7 and follows from an application of

Proposition D.2.

Restricted rational Cherednik algebras

33

Proposition 3.8. For λ ∈ Irr W we have

{c ∈ V(c) | dc
H|c

([Lc(λ)]) is simple} = {c ∈ V(c) | dc
H|c

([Lc(λ)]) = [Lc(λ)]}

(84)

and this set is a neighborhood of the generic point in V(c). We denote it by
DecGen(H|c, Lc(λ)). If V(c) is K×-stable, so is DecGen(H|c, Lc(λ)).

(cid:92)

λ∈Irr W

It is an immediate consequence of Lemma 3.4 that

DecGen(H|c) =

DecGen(H|c, Lc(λ)) .

(85)

Using the preceding genericity results and the splitting of Hc from Proposition
2.4, it is now straightforward to see that the fundamental Theorem 1.33 for simple
Hc-modules supported in the origin of B actually holds for arbitrary c ∈ C(cid:92). We
continue this generalization in Theorem 3.21.
Lemma 3.9 (Etingof–Ginzburg). The following holds for any λ ∈ Irr W and any
c ∈ C(cid:92):
(1) dimkC(c) Lc(λ) ≤ |W|.
(2) If dimkC(c) Lc(λ) = |W|, then Lc(λ) (cid:39) kC(c)W as W -modules.
Deﬁnition 3.10. Let c ∈ C(cid:92) and let λ ∈ Irr W . We say that Lc(λ) is smooth if it
satisﬁes the conditions in Lemma 3.9, otherwise we call it singular. We say that
Hc is smooth, resp. singular, if all its simple modules are smooth, resp. singular.

3.2. Semisimplicity. An easy consequence of the splitting of Hc is the following,
see [8] for details.

Lemma 3.11 (Bellamy-T.). The kC(c)-algebra Hc is semisimple if and only if
∆c(λ) is already irreducible for all λ ∈ Irr W .

From this we obtain:

Lemma 3.12. If Hc is semisimple, then W must be abelian.
Proof. We know from Lemma 3.11 that ∆c(λ) is already irreducible for all λ ∈ Irr W .
Hence, dimkC(c) ∆c(λ) = dimkC(c) Lc(λ). We know from Lemma 3.9 dimkC(c) Lc(λ) ≤
|W|, hence dimkC(c) ∆c(λ) = |W| · dimK λ ≤ |W|, and this implies that dimK λ ≤ 1.
Hence, if Hc is semisimple, then all simple KW -modules are one-dimensional. This
implies that W is abelian.

In combination with the results about cyclic groups from Section A we now

obtain:

Corollary 3.13. The algebra Hc is semisimple if and only if W is abelian and
c ∈ BlGen(H).

3.3. Semi-continuity of Calogero–Moser families. The following semiconti-
nuity property is proven in [75, Theorem C] in a general context.
Theorem 3.14. Let c ∈ C(cid:92). The following holds:
(1) We have

#CMc ≤ #CMc

for all c ∈ V(c).

(86)

(87)

(88)

(2) Let c ∈ V(c). Then #CMc = #CMc if and only if CMc = CMc. If #CMc ≤

#CMc, then CMc is obtained by gluing some families of CMc.

(3) The function V(c) → N, c (cid:55)→ #CMc, is lower semicontinuous, so for each

n ∈ N the set

{c ∈ V(c) | #CMc ≤ n}

is closed in V(c).
For c ∈ C(cid:92) we deﬁne
BlGen(H|c) := {c ∈ V(c) | #CMc = #CMc} = {c ∈ V(c) | CMc = CMc} .

By Theorem 3.14 this is a closed subset of V(c). It plays a similar role for blocks as
the set DecGen(H|c) plays for the simple modules. Let us denote the complement
of BlGen(H|c) in V(c) by BlEx(H|c). The next theorem is a consequence of [75,
Theorem E].
Theorem 3.15. The set BlGen(H|c) is a reduced Weil divisor in V(c), i.e., it is
either empty or pure of codimension one with ﬁnitely many irreducible components.
We can in fact give a rather explicit description of BlGen(H|c). Let c ∈ C(cid:92) be
arbitrary. Since Hc splits, every z ∈ Z(Hc) acts on a simple Hc-module Lc(λ) by a
scalar Ωc

λ(z). The resulting map

λ : Z(Hc) −→ kC(c)
Ωc
λ(z)

(cid:55)−→ Ωc

z

(89)

is a morphism of kC(c)-algebras, the so-called central character of Lc(λ). It is a
standard fact that the central characters determine the families, so λ, µ ∈ Irr W lie
in the same Calogero–Moser c-family if and only if Ωc
Let us now concentrate on the generic point • of C(cid:92). Note that H ⊆ H• and
Z(H) ⊆ Z(H•) = Z(H)•. Since the base ring C of H is normal, it is a standard fact
λ to Z(H) is contained in C ⊆ kC(•), so by
that the image of the restriction of Ω•
restriction we get a C-algebra morphism

µ.
λ = Ωc

λ : Z(H) → C .
Ω(cid:48)

(90)

The following lemma is straightforward.

Restricted rational Cherednik algebras

35

Lemma 3.16. Suppose that Z is a C-subalgebra of Z(H) such that Z• = kC(•) ⊗C
Z ⊆ H• contains all block idempotents of H•. Then λ, µ ∈ Irr W lie in the same
Calogero–Moser •-family if and only if Ω(cid:48)

λ|Z = Ω(cid:48)
scalar (cid:101)Ωλ(z) on L•(λ). Of course, (cid:101)Ωλ(z) = Ω(cid:48)
(cid:101)Ωλ : Z → C

An obvious example is Z = Z(H). But from Theorem 1.32 we get a better
example, namely Z since we have Bl(H•) (cid:39) Bl(Z•). Every z ∈ H also acts as a
λ(z mod 0), where 0 corresponds to
the origin in B ⊆ Z. We thus have a C-algebra morphism

µ|Z.

(91)

and in total we obtain:
Corollary 3.17. Two simple modules λ, µ ∈ Irr W lie in the same Calogero–

Moser •-family if and only if (cid:101)Ωλ = (cid:101)Ωµ. For this, it is suﬃcient to check that
(cid:101)Ωλ(zi) = (cid:101)Ωµ(zi) for all zi in a C-algebra generating system {z1, . . . , zr} of Z.

This description of the Calogero–Moser •-families behaves well under specializa-
tion. The following theorem is proven in [75, Theorem G] in a general context.14
Theorem 3.18. Let {z1, . . . , zr} be a C-algebra generating system of Z. Let c ∈ C(cid:92).
Then λ, µ ∈ Irr W lie in the same Calogero–Moser c-family if and only if

for all i = 1, . . . , r. Hence, for any c ∈ C(cid:92) we have

(cid:101)Ωλ(zi) ≡ (cid:101)Ωµ(zi) mod c
(cid:91)

r(cid:92)

λ,µ∈Irr W

λ and µ lie in

i=1

(92)

(93)

BlEx(H|c) =

V((cid:101)Ωλ(zi) −(cid:101)Ωµ(zi)) ∩ V(c) .

It is possible to give explicit formulas for (cid:101)Ωλ(z) for z ∈ Z written in a PBW basis,

distinct CMc-families

see [13] and [16]. Theorem 3.18 is one ingredient in the approach of Bonnafé and the
author [16] to explicitly determine the Calogero–Moser families for many exceptional
complex reﬂection groups using a computer algebra system. We refer to [16] for
further details and the results. We note that one can choose (N × N)-homogeneous

generators of Z and then the elements (cid:101)Ωλ(zi) ∈ C are (N × N)-homogeneous, too.

From this we immediately deduce:
Lemma 3.19. If V(c) is K×-stable, so are the sets BlGen(H|c) and BlEx(H|c).

It is conjectured that BlEx(H) is in fact a union of hyperplanes, see Conjecture

6.3. This is true in all known cases.

14We use here the just established fact the •-families are already distinguished by the (cid:101)Ωλ.

36

3.4. Two genericity loci. The following is proven in [75, Theorem J] in a general
context.
Theorem 3.20. For any c ∈ C(cid:92) we have DecGen(H|c) ⊆ BlGen(H|c).

In Conjecture 6.1 below we conjecture that we have in fact equality in Theorem
3.20, at least for c being the generic point. There is one case where we can show
this, namely when the Calogero–Moser space is smooth for some c. To this end, we
ﬁrst continue to generalize Theorem 1.33 to non-closed points.
Lemma 3.21. For any λ ∈ Irr W and any c ∈ C(cid:92) the following are equivalent:
(1) dimkC(c) Lc(λ) = |W|.
(2) λ lies in a singleton Calogero–Moser c-family.

Proof. Theorem 1.33 shows the equivalence for closed points c assuming that K
is algebraically closed. Since Hc splits by Proposition 2.4, it also holds without
the assumption on K being algebraically closed. In [71, Proposition 1] we have
given a straightforward character-theoretic proof for (2) ⇒ (1) which works for
any c. We note that this relies on Theorem 3.9 for arbitrary c. Now, suppose that
dimkC(c) Lc(λ) = |W|. Even if C/c is not normal, there is still for any c(cid:48) ∈ V(c)
: G0(Hc) → G0(Hc(cid:48)), see [74]. It
a (possibly not unique) decomposition map dc(cid:48)
H|c
follows from [74, Theorem 2.3] that there is a non-empty open subset U of V(c)
for c(cid:48) ∈ U are trivial. Let c(cid:48) be a closed point
such that all decomposition maps dc(cid:48)
H|c
([Lc(λ)]) = [Lc(cid:48)(λ)], so dimkC(c(cid:48)) Lc(cid:48)(λ) = |W|. Now, it follows
in U. Then dc(cid:48)
H|c
from the implication (1) ⇒ (2) for closed points that Lc(cid:48)(λ) lies in a singleton
Calogero–Moser family. Since c(cid:48) ∈ V(c), the semicontinuity Theorem 3.14 implies
that also Lc(λ) must lie in a singleton Calogero–Moser family.
Corollary 3.22. If Xc is smooth for some c ∈ C(cid:92), then DecGen(H) = BlGen(H).
Proof. If one ﬁber in the Calogero–Moser ﬁbration X → C(cid:92) is smooth, it is also
smooth over some closed point, so we can assume that c is closed. It then follows
from Theorem 1.33 that the Calogero–Moser c-families are singletons and that
dimkC(c) Lc(λ) = |W| for all λ ∈ Irr W . By Lemma 3.4 and Lemma 3.9 the set
DecGen(H) must consist of all c(cid:48) ∈ C(cid:92) such that dimkC(c(cid:48)) Lc(cid:48)(λ) = |W|. Similarly,
by the semicontinuity Theorem 3.14 we know that BlGen(H) consists of all c(cid:48) such
that the Calogero–Moser c(cid:48)-families are singletons. Now, both sets are the same by
Lemma 3.21.

4. Toolbox

In this Chapter we collect several additional results about restricted rational
Cherednik algebras which turned out to be quite useful in applications.

Restricted rational Cherednik algebras

4.1. Euler families. Let c ∈ C(cid:92). The Euler element is the element of Hc deﬁned
as

eu :=

yixi +

s∈Ref(W )

1

εs − 1

c(s)s ,

(94)

i=1 is a basis of h with dual basis (xi)n

where (yi)n
i=1, and εs denotes the non-trivial
eigenvalue of s. Here, c(s) denotes the image of c(s) in c. It is not hard to see that
eu does not depend on the choice of the basis of h and that

n(cid:88)

n(cid:88)

i=1

(cid:88)

(cid:88)

eu =

xiyi +

s∈Ref(W )

εs
εs − 1

c(s)s .

(95)

Furthermore, it is straightforward to verify that eu commutes with all xi, yi, and
w ∈ W , so:
Lemma 4.1. The Euler element is central in Hc.

The Euler element has already played an important role at t (cid:54)= 0 in the work of
Ginzburg–Guay–Opdam–Rouquier [39]. At t = 0, it also plays a very important
role, see for example the work of Bonnafé and Rouquier [13] or the paper [71] by
the author. Its image in Hc is again a non-trivial central element we will again
denote by eu.
Deﬁnition 4.2. We say that λ, µ ∈ Irr W are in the same Euler c-family if
λ(eu) = Ωc
Ωc
The Calogero–Moser c-families reﬁne the Euler c-families since the former are
determined by values of the central characters Ωc
λ on all central elements. It follows
directly from the deﬁnition of the Euler element and the fact that h∗ acts trivially
on ∆c(λ) that eu acts by the following scalar on ∆c(λ), and thus on Lc(λ).
Lemma 4.3. Let c ∈ C(cid:92). For any λ ∈ Irr W we have

µ(eu). We denote the set of Euler c-families by Euc.

Ωc

λ(eu) =

1

χλ(1)

s∈Ref(W )

εs
εs − 1

c(s)χλ(s) ,

(96)

where χλ is the character of λ and c(s) is the image of c(s) in kC(c).
Corollary 4.4. Let c ∈ C(cid:92). Then λ, µ ∈ Irr W lie in the same Euler c-family if
and only if

(cid:88)

εs
εs − 1

c(s)

s∈Ref(W )

(cid:18) χλ(s)

χλ(1)

− χµ(s)
χµ(1)

(cid:19)

= 0 .

(97)

It is a natural question to ask how close the Euler families are to the Calogero–
Moser families. They would clearly coincide if Z = P[eu]. However, this is rarely
the case as the following result by Bonnafé and Rouquier [13, Proposition 5.5.9]
shows:

(cid:88)

38

Ulrich Thiel

Proposition 4.5 (Bonnafé–Rouquier). We have Z = P[eu] if and only if W is of
rank 1.

Nonetheless, the Euler families turn out to be a quite useful tool. If we take

indeterminates c(s) in (97) we obtain:
Corollary 4.6. Two simple modules λ, µ ∈ Irr W lie in the same Euler •-family if
and only if

for all s ∈ Ref(W ).

χµ(1)χλ(s) = χλ(1)χµ(s)

(98)

One can now prove the following result, see [71, Proposition 4].

Proposition 4.7. The linear characters of W lie in singleton Euler •-families,
thus in singleton Calogero–Moser •-families.
4.2. Rigid modules. Recall from Lemma 2.7 that Lc(λ)0 (cid:39) λ as W -modules.
Deﬁnition 4.8. We say that Lc(λ) is rigid if it is concentrated in degree zero, i.e.,
Lc(λ) (cid:39) λ as W -modules. We say that λ ∈ Irr W is c-rigid if Lc(λ) is rigid.

Rigid modules have been introduced and studied in [72]. Recently, they played
an important role in the classiﬁcation of the cuspidal Calogero–Moser families,
see [8]. Rigid modules are easily detected. Namely, both h and h∗ act trivially
on Lc(λ) if it is rigid. The question is thus when an irreducible representation
λ : W → GLr(kC(c)W ) deﬁnes a representation of Hc with h and h∗ acting trivially
and w acting via λ. This is the case if and only if it respects the commutator
relation (8). We thus obtain:
Lemma 4.9. An irreducible representation λ : W → GLr(kC(c)W ) is c-rigid if and
only if

c(s)(y, x)sλ(s) = 0

(99)

for all y ∈ h and x ∈ h∗, where (y, x)s is as deﬁned in (3).
Of course, it is suﬃcient to check (99) for a basis (yi)n
i=1 of h with dual basis
i=1. Note that (99) is a matrix equation in GLr(kC(c)W ). For each λ this
(xi)n
equation deﬁnes a closed K×-stable subscheme of C(cid:92). Once we have explicit
realizations of the irreducible W -representations, we can in principle explicitly
determine the c-rigid ones. Clearly, a necessary condition for λ being c-rigid is the
equation we get from taking traces in (99), i.e.,

(cid:88)

s∈Ref(W )

(cid:88)

s∈Ref(W )

c(s)(yi, xj)sχλ(s) = 0

(100)

for all i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n}, where χλ is the character of λ.
Deﬁnition 4.10. We say that λ ∈ Irr W is weakly c-rigid if it satisﬁes (100).

Bellamy and the author [8] classiﬁed the c-rigid irreducible representations for

all non-exceptional Coxeter groups and all parameters.

4.3. Poincaré series of smooth simple modules. Bellamy [1, Lemma 3.3] has
given a formula for the Poincaré series of smooth simple modules for the restricted
rational Cherednik algebra.1516
Lemma 4.11 (Bellamy). Suppose that Lc(λ) is smooth, i.e., dimkC(c) Lc(λ) = |W|.
Then

dimK(λ) · qbλ∗ · PK[h]co(W ) (q)

.

PLc(λ)(q) =

(101)
Here, fλ∗ (q) is the fake degree of λ∗ as deﬁned in (59) and bλ∗ is the trailing degree
of fλ∗.

fλ∗ (q)

This gives us an eﬀective method to ﬁnd singular simple modules.

Deﬁnition 4.12. We say that λ ∈ Irr W is supersingular if fλ∗ (q) does not divide
the numerator in (101).
Corollary 4.13. If λ is supersingular, then Lc(λ) is singular for all c ∈ C(cid:92), i.e.,
dimkC(c) Lc(λ) < |W|. In particular Xc is singular for all c ∈ C(cid:92).
In [71] we have introduced the notion of good Euler families.

Deﬁnition 4.14. An Euler c-family F is good if it is of one of the following types:
(1) |F| = 1.
(2) |F| = 2 and at least one character in F is supersingular.
(3) |F| = 3 and all characters in F are supersingular.
As an easy consequence of Theorem 3.21 we obtain:

Lemma 4.15. Every good Euler c-family is already a Calogero–Moser c-family.

4.4. The case c = 0. It immediately follows from Lemma 4.9 that all irreducible
W -representations are 0-rigid. We thus know the graded W -module characters of
the simple H0-modules, thus also the graded decomposition numbers of the baby
Verma modules. More explicitly, the restriction map Ggr
0 (KW ) maps
simple modules to simple modules, and as it is injective by Proposition 2.8, it
induces a bijection between the simple modules. Hence, the graded W -module
character of ∆0(λ) from (60) is in fact the graded decomposition of ∆0(λ) into the
simple H0-modules.
Lemma 4.16. In c = 0 there is just a single Calogero–Moser c-family.

0 (H0) → Ggr

Proof. This follows at once from Theorem 3.18 since, as noted after the theorem,

(cid:101)Ωλ is (N × N)-homogeneous.

15The proof works word for word for arbitrary c ∈ C(cid:92).
16In the [1, Lemma 3.3] there is a typo: C[h∗]co(W ) should be C[h]co(W ).

4.5. Further properties of the genericity loci.
Lemma 4.17. If W (cid:54)= 1, then DecGen(H) does not contain 0 ∈ C .
Proof. Let λ be a linear character of W . We know from Proposition 4.7 that λ
lies alone in its Calogero–Moser •-family. Hence, the only constituent of ∆•(λ) is
L•(λ). Suppose that dimkC(•) L•(λ) = 1, i.e., L•(λ) (cid:39) λkC(•) as kC(•)W -modules
by Lemma 2.7. Then

[∆•(λ) : L•(λ)]W = [∆•(λ) : λ]W = [K[h]co(W ) : λ]W = [KW : λ]W = 1 ,

so ∆•(λ) = λ and dimkC(•) ∆•(λ) = 1. But this is not possible since ∆•(λ) (cid:39) KW
and W (cid:54)= 1. Hence, we must have dimkC(•) L•(λ) > 1. But then we cannot have
0 ∈ DecGen(H) since λ is 0-rigid and therefore dimK L0(λ) = 1.

The K×-stability of DecGen(H) from Theorem 3.7 thus implies:

Corollary 4.18. Suppose that W (cid:54)= 1 has just one conjugacy class of reﬂections.
Then

DecGen(H) = C(cid:92) \ {0} .

(102)

Lemma 4.19. If W (cid:54)= 1, then BlGen(H) does not contain 0 ∈ C .
Proof. The group W has at least two linear characters, since the determinant
det : W → K× is nontrivial. Hence, there are at least two Calogero–Moser •-
families by Proposition 4.7, whereas there is just one Calogero–Moser 0-family by
Lemma 4.16.

The K×-stability of BlGen(H) from Lemma 3.19 thus implies:

Corollary 4.20. Suppose that W (cid:54)= 1 has just one conjugacy class of reﬂections.
Then

(103)
Corollary 4.21. We have DecGen(H) = BlGen(H) if W (cid:54)= 1 has just one conjugacy
class of reﬂections.

BlGen(H) = C(cid:92) \ {0} .

5. Explicit results

5.1. Extreme cases. We recall that for c = 0 we know the solutions to all
problems in Section 2.6 by Section 4.4, so we can ignore this case. On the other
extreme end, for a smooth simple module Lc(λ), i.e., dimkC(c) Lc(λ) = |W| we know
that it is in a singleton Calogero–Moser family by Theorem 3.21, we know its
Poincaré series by Lemma 4.11, we know that it is isomorphic to KW as W -module
by Theorem 3.9, and we know the (non-graded) multiplicity in its baby Verma
module. What we do not know, however, is its graded W -module character.

5.2. Smooth Calogero–Moser spaces. Assume that K is algebraically closed.
Etingof and Ginzburg [32, Theorem 1.13, Corollary 1.14] have shown that for sym-
metric groups, the groups G(m, 1, n), and the cyclic groups there is an isomorphism
between the Calogero–Moser space Xc and a certain Nakajima quiver variety Mc
for all closed points c in an open subset of C(cid:92). The latter variety was proven to
be smooth, see [32, Lemma 1.12], hence the Calogero–Moser space is smooth for
generic c for these groups. Bellamy [1] has proven that for the exceptional group
G4 all simple Hc-modules are of dimension equal to the order of G4 for all closed
points c in an open subset of C(cid:92). By Theorem 1.33 this implies that Xc is smooth
for all such c. Bellamy [1] has furthermore shown that for W diﬀerent from the
symmetric groups, the groups G(m, 1, n), the cyclic groups, and the group G4 there
always exists a supersingular character as deﬁned in Deﬁnition 4.13. Hence, for all
these groups Xc is singular for all c. From these results the complete classiﬁcation
of all W such that Xc is smooth for some c was obtained. To summarize:
Corollary 5.1 (Bellamy, Etingof–Ginzburg, Gordon, Martino). Assume that K is
algebraically closed and that W is irreducible. Then the Calogero–Moser space Xc
is smooth for some c ∈ C if and only if W is a symmetric group, a group of the
form G(m, 1, n), a cyclic group, or the exceptional group G4.

From the way the results have been obtained in the singular cases we obtain

the following surprising fact:

Corollary 5.2 (Bellamy, Etingof–Ginzburg, Gordon, Martino). Suppose that K is
algebraically closed and that W is irreducible. Let c ∈ C . Then the Calogero–Moser
space Xc is smooth if and only if Hc is smooth (equivalently, all closed points of
Υ−1
c (0) are smooth in Xc).
Due to the splitting of Hc for arbitrary c ∈ C(cid:92) by Proposition 2.4 and our results

in Section 3, we get for arbitrary K:

Corollary 5.3. Assume that W is irreducible. Then the algebra H• is smooth if
and only if W is a symmetric group, a group of the form G(m, 1, n), a cyclic group,
or the exceptional group G4.

5.3. Symmetric groups. As the symmetric group has just one conjugacy class of
reﬂections, we only have to consider an arbitrary 0 (cid:54)= c ∈ C due to the K×-stability
of all properties. Since Xc is smooth by 5.2 the only thing we do not already
know is the graded W -module character of the simple modules Lc(λ). This was
solved by Gordon [41, Theorem 6.4] who showed that it is given by certain Kostka
polynomials. Hence, all problems in Section 2.6 are answered for symmetric groups.

5.4. Dihedral groups. The classiﬁcation of rigid modules by Bellamy and the
author [8] shows that almost all simple modules are rigid. In Chapter B we consider
the non-rigid simple modules and solve in this way the case of dihedral groups
completely.

5.5. Calogero–Moser families for G(m, p, n). Martino [60] has given a com-
plete description of the Calogero–Moser families for the groups G(m, p, n) for all
parameters.

5.6. Cyclic groups. Recall from Proposition 4.5 that if W is cyclic, then Z =
P[eu]. Using the theory in Section 3.3 the Calogero–Moser c-families are thus simply
the Euler c-families for all c and these can be explicitly computed. In Section A we
explicitly compute the simple Hc-modules for all c, and from this one can derive
the solutions to the problems in Section 2.6.

5.7. Exceptional groups. In [73] the author has explicitly computed the solu-
tions to all Problems in Section 2.6 for G4 and for all parameters using computational
methods. In [71] we have shown that for precisely the groups

G4, G5, G6, G8, G10, G23 = H3, G24, G25, G26

there are only good Euler •-families as deﬁned in Deﬁnition 4.14, hence they are al-
ready equal to the Calogero–Moser •-families by Lemma 4.15. Because of Corollary
4.6 one only needs the character table to compute this. Since G23 = H3 and G24
have just one conjugacy class of reﬂections, we know the Calogero–Moser families
for all parameters by Corollary 4.20.

With much more computational eﬀort we have determined in [73] the complete

solutions to all problems in Section 2.6 for generic parameters for the groups

G4, G5, G6, G7, G8, G9, G10, G12, G13, G14, G15, G16, G20, G22, G23 = H3, G24 .

In recent work by Bonnafé and the author [16] we could compute the Calogero–
Moser families for all parameters for many exceptional complex reﬂection groups.
This includes in particular the Weyl group G28 = F4. We refer to [16] for the
details. All results computed so far are available on the author’s websites

http://www.mathematik.uni-stuttgart.de/~thiel/RRCA

and

http://thielul.github.io/CHAMP

On the latter website the Cherednik Algebra Magma Package CHAMP presented
by the author in [73] is freely available. This is a package based on the computer
algebra system Magma for performing basic computations in rational Cherednik
algebras at arbitrary parameters and in baby Verma modules for restricted rational
Cherednik algebras. Part of this package is a new Las Vegas algorithm for computing
the head and the constituents of a local module in characteristic zero which we used
to explicitly compute simple modules for restricted rational Cherednik algebras. It
contains a database with all the results computed so far. In the following example
we show how to access the dimensions of the simple H•-modules for the exceptional
complex reﬂection group G20.

The data available in CHAMP also allows to do a ﬁrst sanity check on conjectures.
For example, we can show that in all covered cases the Poincaré series of simple
Hc-modules is always palindromic for generic c.
for n in {4..37} do ;
W := ExceptionalComplexReflectionGroup (n );
try g := Gordon (W ); catch e; end try ;
if assigned g [1] ‘ SimplePSeries then ;
for f in g [1] ‘ SimplePSeries do ;
assert IsPalindromic (f );
end for ; end if ; end for ;
But we can also ﬁnd examples where this does not hold anymore for special c. The
following shows that for G4 on the hyperplane deﬁned by 2k1,1 − k1,2 there is a
simple module for the restricted rational Cherednik algebra with non-palindromic
Poincaré series.

for n in {4..37} do ;
W := ExceptionalComplexReflectionGroup (n );

6. Conjectures and further problems

We state the following conjecture:

Conjecture 6.1. We have DecGen(H) = BlGen(H).

We know from Corollary 4.18 and Corollary 4.20 that this holds whenever W
has just a single conjugacy class of reﬂections. From Corollary 3.22 we furthermore
know that Conjecture 6.1 holds whenever Xc is smooth for some c. Hence, in total,
Conjecture 6.1 holds at least for the following groups:

Sn, G(m, 1, n), G(m, m, n) with n > 2 or n = 2 and m even, Cm, G12,
G22, G23 = H3, G24, G27, G29, G30 = H4, G31, G33, G34, G35 = E6,
G36 = E7, G37 = E8, G4.

The following problem is due to Bonnafé–Rouquier [13] (see also [73]).

Problem 6.2. Is the set BlEx(H) a union of hyperplanes?

It follows from [75] that BlEx(H) is a reduced Weil divisor, so if the above
problem has a positive answer, then BlEx(H) is indeed a ﬁnite union of hyperplanes.
Recently, Bellamy [7] has shown that the above problem has a positive answer in
case the Calogero–Moser space is generically smooth. The proof relies on deeper
geometric properties of Calogero–Moser spaces. We would like to introduce the
following strengthening of the above problem.

Problem 6.3. Is the set BlEx(H) a union of hyperplanes with integral coeﬃcients?

Problem 6.4. Assuming that BlEx(H) is a union of hyperplanes, study properties
of the corresponding hyperplane arrangement.

Problem 6.5. Solve the problems in Section 2.6.

Problem 6.6. Is the Poincaré series of Lc(λ) palindromic for generic c? This
problem was raised in [73].

Problem 6.7. Find an abstract proof of Theorem 1.1 (i.e., a proof not using the
Shephard–Todd classiﬁcation).

Problem 6.8. Find an eﬀective condition for rigidity not relying on an explicit
realization of the irreducible representation. For example for G34 we cannot compute
the rigid representations simply since we do not have realizations of many of the
irreducible representations.17

Problem 6.9. Find a conceptual proof of Corollary 5.1.

Problem 6.10. Is Hc cellular in the sense of Graham–Lehrer [47]? Here one
might have to restrict to Coxeter groups W .

17They are so far not available in CHEVIE [26] or in the development version of the CHEVIE

package of GAP3 by Michel [62].

Problem 6.11. Let O be the character value ring of W , i.e., the ring of integers in
the character ﬁeld of W . Does Hc have an O-free O-form (for appropriate choices
of O-valued c)? See [73, §4.2] for further details.

Problem 6.12. The preceding problem is related to the following: Let W be a
complex reﬂection group and let O be the ring of integers in its character ﬁeld
K (i.e., the ﬁeld generated by the values of its irreducible characters). Does the
coinvariant algebra K[h]coW have an O-free O-form?
Problem 6.13. Are the conditions in Theorem 1.36 in fact equivalent to Z(Hc) (cid:39)
Zc by some algebra isomorphism?

A. Cyclic groups
Throughout, we assume that h := C and that W ⊆ GL(h) is a cyclic reﬂection
group of order m ≥ 2. We denote by w ∈ W a generator acting by a primitive m-th
root of unity ζ on h. By y := 1 we denote the standard basis vector of h and by
x ∈ h∗ = C we denote its dual. The conjugacy classes of reﬂections in W are (wr)
for 1 ≤ r ≤ m − 1, so we have parameters c := (cr)1≤r≤m−1 ∈ C for the rational
Cherednik algebra. We will use here instead the parameters k := (kr)1≤r≤m−1
introduced in [39] as the results will have a much nicer presentations with these
parameters. We furthermore set k0 := 0 and treat the indices of the parameters
modulo m. The group W has m irreducible representations ρ0, . . . , ρm−1 deﬁned
by ρr(w) = wr. For 0 ≤ r ≤ m − 1 we set ∆r,k := ∆k(ρr) and Lr,k := Lk(ρr).
We have C[h]coW = C[x]/(xm), so it has the C-basis xr for 0 ≤ r ≤ m − 1. In
particular, also ∆r,k has this C-basis.

A.1. Simple modules. We will give explicit formulas for the action of Hk on
∆r,k. For l ∈ Z we deﬁne

{0 < l ≤ m − 1 | γr,k(l) = 0}

if this set is not empty, and εr,k := m if it is empty.
Theorem A.3. The radical of ∆r,k is equal to (cid:104)xεr,k , . . . , xm−1(cid:105)C. In particular
we have

dim Lr,k = codim(Rad(∆r,k)) = εr,k

and ∆r,k is irreducible if and only if εr,k = m.

Proof. Let V := (cid:104)xεr,k , . . . , xm−1(cid:105)C. This subspace is obviously closed under the
operation of x and w. If εr,k = m, then V = 0 and this is an Hk-submodule. For
εr,k < m we obviously have y.xl ∈ V for l > εr,k and y.xεr,k = −γr,k(εr,k)xεr,k−1 =
0. Hence, V is an Hk-submodule. Moreover, V is a proper submodule of ∆r,k since
εr,k > 0. It remains to shows that V is maximal. So, let U be a submodule with
V < U ≤ ∆r,k. Then there exists u ∈ U with l ∈ Supp(u) for some 0 ≤ l < εr,k.
Let l := max{i ∈ Supp(u) | i < εr,k}. Then

If l = 0, then the coeﬃcient of x0 is equal to 1. Otherwise, the factors γr,k(l)
to γr,k(1) occur in the product and since l < εr,k, all these factors are non-zero.
So, in general we have yl.(αlxl) (cid:54)= 0. For i < l we have yl.xi = 0. For i > l we
have y.(αixi) ∈ V since either i < εr,k and therefore i /∈ Supp(u) because of the
maximality of l, or i ≥ εr,k and therefore αixi ∈ V by deﬁnition. Consequently,

lx0 ∈ U and therefore x0 ∈ U. This ﬁnally
for certain α(cid:48)
shows that xi = xi.x0 ∈ U for all i, i.e., U = ∆r,k. So, V is maximal and therefore
V = Rad(∆r,k).
Deﬁnition A.4. We call the tuple εk := (ε0,k, . . . , εm−1,k) the type of Hk.
Corollary A.5. The C-algebra Hk is semisimple if and only if εr,k = m for all
0 ≤ r ≤ m − 1, or, equivalently, Γr,k (cid:54)= 0 for all 0 ≤ r ≤ m − 1.
Proof. This follows from Theorem A.3 in conjunction with Lemma 3.11.

Proof. If i − j (cid:54)= 0, then it follows from the formula for the action of Hk on ∆r,k

A.2. The Schur elements. Recall from Corollary 1.35 and Proposition 2.4 that
Hk is a split symmetric Frobenius C-algebra with symmetrizing trace Φk. Hence,
by the theory in [36, §7] there is a Schur element Sr,k deﬁned for each simple
Hk-module Lr,k.
Theorem A.8. Suppose that Hk is semisimple, see Corollary A.5. The Schur
element Sr,k of Lr,k is equal to

Sr,k = (−1)m−1mΓr,k = (−1)m−1mm

(km+1−r − kt).

m−1(cid:89)

A.3. Character tables.
Theorem A.9. Suppose that Hk is semisimple. Then the dimension of Hk/[Hk, Hk]
is equal to |W| = m and has

(ΩΩ∗g)g∈W

as basis, where Ω := xm−1, resp. Ω∗ := ym−1, are the fundamental classes of
C[h]coW , resp. of C[h∗]coW .
Proof. Since Hk is split semisimple, we have dim Hk/[Hk, Hk] = # Irr Hk = |W|.
It thus remains to show that the given elements are linearly independent modulo
q=0 αqΩΩ∗wq ≡ 0 mod [Hk, Hk] for certain αq ∈ C,
q=0 αqΩΩ∗wq ∈ [Hk, Hk]. For every 0 ≤ r ≤ m − 1 we know that χr,k is a

has a non-trivial solution over C if and only if the determinant of the matrix
((ζ r)q)(r,q)∈[0,m−1]2 is zero. This is a Vandermonde matrix and as ζ r (cid:54)= ζ r(cid:48) for
0 ≤ r, r(cid:48) ≤ m − 1 and r (cid:54)= r(cid:48), this determinant is indeed non-zero and so there is
just the trivial solution, i.e., αq = 0 for all q.

B. Dihedral groups

In the following we will deal with dihedral groups. We repeat some bits of [8]
here to be able to use the same setup. Throughout, we assume that m ≥ 5 and
choose a primitive m-th root of unity ζ ∈ C. Let W be the Coxeter group of type
I2(m). This is the dihedral group of order 2m. It has two natural presentations,
namely the Coxeter presentation (cid:104)s, t | s2 = t2 = (st)m = 1(cid:105) and the geometric
presentation (cid:104)s, r | rm = 1, s2 = 1, s−1rs = r−1(cid:105) with a generating rotation r := st
for the symmetries of a regular m-gon. The representation theory of W depends
on the parity of m. If m is odd, the conjugacy classes of W are

{1}, {r±1}, {r±2}, . . . , {r±(m−1)/2}, {rls | 0 ≤ l ≤ m − 1} ,

and so the total number of conjugacy classes is (m + 3)/2. There are two irreducible
one-dimensional representations: the trivial one 1W and the sign representation
ε : W → C with

ε(s) = −1 ,

ε(t) = −1 ,

ε(r) = 1 .

The remaining (m + 3)/2 − 2 = (m − 1)/2 irreducible representations ϕi, 1 ≤ i ≤
(m − 1)/2, are all two-dimensional and are given by

We denote the character of ϕi by χi. If m is even, then the conjugacy classes of W
are

{1} , {r±1} , {r±2} , . . . ,{r±m/2} ,
{r2ks | 0 ≤ k ≤ (m/2) − 1} , {r2k+1s | 0 ≤ k ≤ (m/2) − 1} ,

Restricted rational Cherednik algebras

53

and so the total number of conjugacy classes is (m + 6)/2. There are four irreducible
one-dimensional representations: the trivial one 1W , the sign representation ε, and
two further representations ε1, ε2 with

ε(s) = −1 ,
ε1(s) = 1 ,
ε2(s) = −1 ,

ε(t) = −1 ,
ε1(t) = −1 ,
ε2(t) = 1 ,

ε(r) = 1 ,
ε1(r) = −1 ,
ε2(r) = −1 .

The remaining (m + 6)/2 − 4 = (m − 2)/2 irreducible representations ϕi, 1 ≤ i ≤
(m − 2)/2, are all two-dimensional and are deﬁned as in case m is odd. Again, we
denote the character of ϕi by χi.

B.1. Reﬂections and parameters. The two-dimensional faithful irreducible
representation ϕ1 of W is a reﬂection representation in which precisely the elements
sl := rls for 0 ≤ l ≤ m − 1 act as reﬂections. We will always ﬁx this representation
as the reﬂection representation of W . Let (y1, y2) be the standard basis of h := C2
and let (x1, x2) be the dual basis. Roots and coroots for the reﬂections sl are given
by

αsl = x1 − ζ−lx2

and α∨

sl

= y1 − ζy2 .

With this we see that the Cherednik coeﬃcients (yi, xj)sl = −(yi, αsl )(α∨

, xj) are:

sl

(y1, x1)sl = −1 ,

(y1, x2)sl = ζ−l ,

(y2, x1)sl = ζ l ,

(y2, x2)sl = −1 .

If m is odd, there is just one conjugacy class of reﬂections in W , namely the one of
s which is {sl | 0 ≤ l ≤ m − 1}. If m is even, there are two conjugacy classes of
reﬂections in W , namely the one of s which is {s2l | 0 ≤ l ≤ m
2 − 1} and the one of
t which is {s2l+1 | 0 ≤ l ≤ m

2 − 1}. Note that

(cid:18) 0

ϕi(sl) =

If c : Ref(W ) → C is a function which is constant on conjugacy classes, then we

deﬁne

a := c(t) .

b := c(s) ,

(111)
We ﬁx such a function from now on and assume that c (cid:54)= 0. Note that if m is odd,
we have a = b.
Remark B.1. In [8] we used a slightly diﬀerent relation for the rational Cherednik
algebra but this simply amounts to replacing our parameters a, b by −2a,−2b.
Since everything is C∗-stable, this does not change anything.

B.2. Rigid modules. Table 2 is a summary of the results obtained in [8]. To
simplify notations, we denote by F the set of two-dimensional irreducible characters
of W . To allow a presentation which is independent of the parity of m we set

(cid:26) {ϕi | 1 < i ≤ (m − 1)/2} = F \ {ϕ1}

{ϕi | 1 < i < (m − 2)/2} = F \ {ϕ1, ϕ(m−2)/2}

if m is odd
if m is even.

R :=

We make the convention that we ignore ε1 and ε2 whenever m is odd.

B.3. Basis of the coinvariant algebra. By [53, Chapter II, §8] a system fun-
damental invariants of C[h]W is formed by xm
Proposition B.3. Fix the lexicographical ordering on C[h] = C[x1, x2] with x1 >
x2. Then the elements

2 and x1x2.

2 , x1x2, and xm+1

(images of the) elements

1, xi

1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ m − 1, and xj

2 for 1 ≤ j ≤ m

form a monomial basis of the coinvariant algebra of W . Replacing x by y gives the
analogous statement for W ∗.
Proof. The Hilbert ideal is generated by f1 := xm
2 and f2 := x1x2. We will now
complete this generating system to a Gröbner basis by employing the Buchberger
algorithm, see [34, §21.5]. To this end, we ﬁrst have to compute the S-polynomial
of f1 and f2. In general, the S-polynomial of two polynomials p, q ∈ C[x1, x2] is
deﬁned as

1 +xm

S(p, q) :=

xγ(p,q)
LT(p)

p − xγ(p,q)
LT(q)

q ,

where x := {x1, x2} and LT denotes the leading terms and
γ(p, q) := (max{α1, β1}, max{α2, β2})

with α := mdeg(p) being the multi-degree of p and β := mdeg(q) being the multi-
degree of q. In our case we have mdeg(f1) = (m, 0) and mdeg(f2) = (1, 1). Hence,
γ(f1, f2) = (m, 1) and therefore

f3 := S(f1, f2) =

Now, we have to compute the remainder f3 rem (f1, f2) of f3 when dividing by
(f1, f2) using the multivariate division algorithm, see [34, 21.11]. The leading terms
of f1 and f2 do not divide f3 and therefore

f3 rem (f1, f2) = f3 .

According to the Buchberger algorithm this means that we have to add f3 to the
basis. In the next round of this algorithm the remainder of f3 = S(f1, f2) when
dividing by (f1, f2, f3) is of course zero. Furthermore, we have

S(f1, f3) =

the residue of f3 when dividing by (f1, f2, f3) is equal to zero. So, the residue of
the S-polynomial of any pair in (f1, f2, f3) when dividing by this triple is equal to
zero and so the Buchberger criterion implies that they form a Gröbner basis of the
Hilbert ideal. By [37, Theorem 1.2.8] a monomial basis of the coinvariant algebra
K[x1, x2]/(cid:104)f1, f2, f3(cid:105) of W is now formed by the images of the elements

The monomials given in the statement are precisely those satisfying this property.

B.4. Odd dihedral groups. Let c (cid:54)= 0. From Proposition 4.7 we know that the
Lc(λ) attached to one-dimensional λ lie in singleton Calogero–Moser •-families, so
from Theorem 3.21 we obtain:
Corollary B.4. Both Lc(1) and Lc(ε) are smooth.

Due to the classiﬁcation of rigid modules in Theorem B.2 only the simple module
Lc(ϕ1) is not yet understood. To simplify some formulas, we introduce the following
notation. Let 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 2. For any k ∈ N we set x2k+i := xi and y2k+j := yj,
i.e., we extend the indices 2-periodically. The following lemma is a straightforward
computation.

Theorem B.7. The radical of ∆c(ϕ1) has the following elements as basis:

2 ⊗ xq

for 2 < r ≤ m and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 .

Hence,

Moreover, as a graded W -module we have

dim Lc(ϕ1) = 6 .

Lc(ϕ1)W = (1 + t2) · ϕ1 + t · 1 + t · ε .

Proof. Using the formulas so far it is not hard to verify that the deﬁned subspace
J of ∆c(ϕ1) is invariant under the standard generators of Hc and is thus an Hc-
submodule of ∆c(ϕ1). It remains to verify that the quotient ∆c(ϕ1)/J is simple.
To compute the quotient ∆c(ϕ1)/J, we consider the C-vector space complement of
J in ∆c(ϕ1) spanned by

1 ⊗ x1, 1 ⊗ x2, x1 ⊗ x2, x2 ⊗ x1, x2

1 ⊗ x2, x2

2 ⊗ x1 .

The action of Hc on ∆c(ϕ1)/J is now determined by the following relations which
are not hard to verify using the formulas we discussed so far and the structure of

Restricted rational Cherednik algebras

the Gröbner basis of the coinvariant algebra given in B.3. First, we consider the
action of x1:

x1.(1 ⊗ x1) = x1 ⊗ x1 ≡ 0 mod J ,
x1.(1 ⊗ x2) = x1 ⊗ x2 ,
x1.(x1 ⊗ x2) = x2
1 ⊗ x2 ,
x1.(x2 ⊗ x1) = x1x2 ⊗ x1 = 0 ,
x1.(x2
x1.(x2

1 ⊗ x2) = x3
2 ⊗ x2) = x1x2

1 ⊗ x2 ≡ 0 mod J ,

2 ⊗ x2 = 0 .

The matrix of the actions of x1 and x2 on ∆c(ϕ1)/J are thus given by

For the actions of y1 and y2 on ∆c(ϕ1)/J we obtain

Finally, for the actions of s and rl on ∆c(ϕ1)/J we obtain

Due to the C∗-stability, we can assume that c = 2/m. Then c and m disappear in
the matrices above. The resulting 6-dimensional H2m-module is easily seen to be
irreducible (this can also easily be veriﬁed computationally by applying a modular
reduction and the MeatAxe to the above family of matrices over C, which do
not contain contain any parameter any more). Hence, ∆c(ϕ1)/J is irreducible.
Hence, this quotient is equal to Lc(ϕ1) which is therefore 6-dimensional. Using the
above matrices for the action of W on Lc(ϕ1), we can also immediately read oﬀ
the structure of Lc(ϕ1) as a graded W -module.

C. Double centralizer properties
Let A be a ring and let e ∈ A be an non-zero idempotent. Left multiplication by e
yields a functor

(129)
As in [33] we call it the Schur functor associated to e. Note that Ae is naturally
an (A, eAe)-bimodule and so HomA(Ae, M ) is naturally a left eAe-module for any
left A-module M. Mapping ϕ ∈ HomA(Ae, M ) to ϕ(e) yields an eAe-module
isomorphism

E : A-mod → eAe-mod .

(130)
The inverse maps m ∈ eM to the map Ae → M mapping ae to am, see [54,
Proposition 21.6]. By (130) we get a natural isomorphism

HomA(Ae, M )

∼−→ eM .

∼−→ HomA(Ae,−)

E

(131)

of functors. In particular, E is representable by a ﬁnitely generated projective
A-module and thus exact. For M = Ae the isomorphism in (130) is in fact a ring
isomorphism

EndAop (Ae)op ∼−→ eAe .

(132)

60

Ulrich Thiel

The inverse maps an element of eAe to right multiplication on Ae with this element.
By [66, §4.2] the functor E has right adjoint given by

G := HomeAe(E(A),−) = HomeAe(Ae,−) : eAe-mod → A-mod .

This functor is fully faithful and so the unit ε : EG → id of the adjunction E (cid:97) G
is an isomorphism. The counit η : id → GE evaluated at A is a left A-module
morphism

A → GE(A) = HomeAe(Ae, HomA(Ae, A)) = EndeAe(Ae) .

(133)

In fact, this morphism maps a to left multiplication by a. This map is in general
neither injective nor surjective.

The next lemma is well-known, see [66, Proposition 4.33].

Lemma C.1. The following are equivalent:
(1) A → EndeAe(Ae) is an isomorphism.
(2) The restriction of E to the category A-proj of ﬁnitely generated projective

A-modules is fully faithful.

(3) E induces an equivalence between A-proj and eAe-proj.

If this holds, we say that the (A, e) satisﬁes the double centralizer property and
say that E is a cover.

Because of the trivial isomorphism (132) the pair (A, e) satisﬁes the double
centralizer property if and only if the (A, eAe)-bimodule Ae satisﬁes the double
centralizer property as deﬁned in [69, II.5]. The following lemma is also well-known,
see [13, Lemme 5.2.9].
Lemma C.2. If (A, e) satisﬁes the double centralizer property, then multiplication
by e induces an isomorphism Z(A)

∼−→ Z(eAe).

The isomorphism in Lemma C.2 is called the Satake isomorphism.

D. Decomposition maps

In this section we assume that R is a noetherian normal ring with fraction ﬁeld K
and that A is an R-algebra which is free and ﬁnitely generated as an R-module. We
assume furthermore that for any p ∈ Spec(R) the k(p)-algebra A(p) := k(p) ⊗R A
A : G0(AK) → G0(A(p)) as
splits. We then have a unique decomposition map dp
deﬁned by Geck and Rouquier [35], see also [74]. We recall from [74] that dp
A can
be realized by a discrete valuation ring in K with maximal ideal lying above p.
be a discrete valuation ring with maximal ideal m lying above p, and let (cid:101)V be an
Lemma D.1. Let p ∈ Spec(R). Let V be a ﬁnite-dimensional AK-module, let O
O-free AO-form of V . If (cid:101)V /m(cid:101)V has simple head S, then [S] is a constituent of

A([V / Rad(V )]).
dp

Restricted rational Cherednik algebras

Proof. Let (cid:101)J := (cid:101)V ∩ Rad(V ). It follows from [29, Proposition 23.7] that (cid:101)J is a pure
submodule of the O-module (cid:101)V , i.e., the quotient (cid:101)Q := (cid:101)V /(cid:101)J is O-torsion free. Since
O is a discrete valuation ring, it follows that (cid:101)Q is already O-free. Clearly, (cid:101)Q is an
A([V / Rad(V )]) = [(cid:101)Q/m(cid:101)Q]. We have an exact sequence
0 → (cid:101)J → (cid:101)V → (cid:101)Q → 0

AO-form of V / Rad(V ), so dp

61

and tensoring with the residue ﬁeld k(m) yields an exact sequence

(cid:101)J/m(cid:101)J → (cid:101)V /m(cid:101)V → (cid:101)Q/m(cid:101)Q → 0 .

The image of the map (cid:101)J/m(cid:101)J → (cid:101)V /m(cid:101)V is equal to ((cid:101)J + m(cid:101)V )/m(cid:101)V , so
(cid:101)Q/m(cid:101)Q (cid:39) ((cid:101)V /m(cid:101)V )/(((cid:101)J + m(cid:101)V )/m(cid:101)V ) (cid:39) (cid:101)V /(J + m(cid:101)V ) .
If we can show that (cid:101)J + m(cid:101)V is a proper submodule of (cid:101)V , it follows that S is
a constituent of (cid:101)Q/m(cid:101)Q. Since m = Rad(O), we have m(AO) ⊆ Rad(AO) by [52,
Corollary 5.9]. By [29, Proposition 5.6(iii)] we have Rad(AO)(cid:101)V ⊆ Rad((cid:101)V ). Hence,
if (cid:101)J + m(cid:101)V = (cid:101)V , then (cid:101)J + Rad((cid:101)V )(cid:101)V = (cid:101)V . This implies that (cid:101)J = (cid:101)V by Nakayama’s
lemma [29, Corollary 5.3]. By [29, Proposition 23.7] this is not possible, since (cid:101)J is

a pure O-form of the proper submodule Rad(V ).

Proposition D.2. Let S be a simple AK-module. Then the set
A([S]) is simple}

DecGen(A, S) := {p ∈ Spec(R) | dp
is a neighborhood of the generic point in Spec(R).

(134)

Proof. Let

ρ : AK → Matr(K)

be a K-algebra morphism corresponding to the simple AK-module S. Since AK
splits, the morphism ρ is surjective. In [74, Proposition 4.3] we have shown that
the set

Gen(ρ) := {p ∈ Spec(R) | ρ(Ap) = Matr(Rp)}

is a neighborhood of the generic point in Spec(R). If p ∈ Gen(ρ), then ρ restricts
to a surjective Rp-algebra morphism

ρ|Ap : Ap (cid:16) Matr(Rp)

and reduction in p yields a surjective k(p)-algebra morphism

ρ|Ap : A(p) (cid:16) Matr(k(p)) .

The morphism ρ|Ap describes an A(p)-module S and since it is surjective, the
Ap-form (cid:101)S of S. We thus have dp
module S must be simple. Furthermore, the morphism ρ|Ap describes an Rp-free
A([S]) = [S], the class of a simple module. Hence,
Gen(ρ) ⊆ DecGen(A, S).
