Abstract:

The eﬀect of magnetic perturbations (MPs) on the helical self-organization of shaped tokamak
plasmas is discussed in the framework of the nonlinear 3D MHD model. Numerical simulations
performed in toroidal geometry with the pixie3d code [L. Chac´on, Phys. Plasmas 15, 056103 (2008)]
show that n = 1 MPs signiﬁcantly aﬀect the spontaneous quasi-periodic sawtoothing activity of such
plasmas. In particular, the mitigation of sawtooth oscillations is induced by m/n = 1/1 and 2/1
MPs. These numerical ﬁndings provide a conﬁrmation of previous circular tokamak simulations,
and are in agreement with tokamak experiments in the RFX-mod and DIII-D devices. Sawtooth
mitigation via MPs has also been observed in reversed-ﬁeld pinch simulations and experiments. The
eﬀect of MPs on the stochastization of the edge magnetic ﬁeld is also discussed.

Introduction

Three-dimensional (3D) eﬀects play an important role in the physics of nominally axisymmetric
toroidal conﬁgurations for the magnetic conﬁnement of fusion plasmas, such as the tokamak
and the reversed-ﬁeld pinch (RFP). 3D eﬀects can result from plasma self-organization, in par-
ticular when a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instability nonlinearly saturates and gives rise
to a long-lived helical state. This occurs in the RFP with the spontaneous emergence of the
single-helical-axis (SHAx) state with improved conﬁnement properties [1], and in the tokamak
with the so-called density snake [2] and the long-lived helical states in advanced regimes [3]. On
the other hand, 3D eﬀects can be induced by external magnetic perturbations (MPs) produced
with non-axisymmetric coils. Notable tokamak applications of non-axisymmetric coil systems,
traditionally used for error ﬁeld correction and feedback control of MHD instabilities [4], are
edge-localized modes (ELMs) suppression [5], drive of neoclassical toroidal rotation [6], and
Alfv´en modes mitigation [7]. In addition, spontaneous and externally applied 3D eﬀects can
couple. In fact, it is possible to stimulate and control the spontaneous helical self-organization
with the application of external 3D ﬁelds. This has been ﬁrst demonstrated in the RFP con-
ﬁguration.
In the RFX-mod experiment [8], the persistence of spontaneous SHAx states is
increased by applying MPs with the same helicity as the core helical structure [9]. It is also
possible to stimulate helical states under conditions where they do not form spontaneously, such
as at low current or high density [10]. Moreover, by applying MPs with helicities diﬀerent from
the spontaneous one, helical states with the chosen helicity can be induced [11, 12]. In all the
above cases, MPs are found to mitigate the spontaneous sawtooth activity of RFP plasmas [13].

2

This observation has triggered similar tokamak experiments in RFX-mod operated as a circular
Ohmic tokamak and then in DIII-D. In both devices, MPs with n = 1 toroidal periodicity have
been shown to mitigate the sawtooth activity associated with the internal kink mode [14, 15].
This evidence points to the common physics basis of RFP and tokamak plasmas.

The nonlinear visco-resistive 3D MHD model is successful in qualitatively reproducing the
above-mentioned experimental ﬁndings. In the RFP case, the experimental discovery of persis-
tent helical states [16] has been stimulated by the spontaneous helical self-organization occurring
in nonlinear 3D MHD simulations with ideal boundary conditions when the visco-resistive dis-
sipation is increased [17, 18, 19]. A closer agreement with respect to experimental observations
has been obtained after the modiﬁcation of the boundary conditions of numerical tools to allow
for MPs of the plasma boundary [20]. With the application of MPs, the parameter space of he-
lical RFP solutions is substantially enlarged towards small visco-resistive dissipation conditions.
Numerical RFP studies with MPs have reproduced both the increased sawtoothing frequency
and spontaneous helical state persistence [21, 22, 23] and the stimulation of helical states with
diﬀerent helicities [21]. Qualitative agreement with respect to experimental ﬁndings is obtained
in tokamak modelling as well, where sawtooth mitigation and helical self-organization triggered
by MPs are observed [14, 23]. In this report, we extend previous tokamak studies performed by
assuming a circular axisymmetric equilibrium, by investigating the eﬀect of MPs in D-shaped
diverted tokamak conﬁgurations. This is motivated on the one hand by a closer comparison with
sawtooth mitigation experiments in DIII-D, and on the other hand by a more general eﬀort of
numerical tools development towards realistic conditions.

The paper is organized as follows. After a description of the employed numerical model in Sec.
2, numerical results are reported in Sec. 3. Two shaped axisymmetric equilibria are described
in Sec. 3.1, one elongated and one D-shaped conﬁguration. In Sec. 3.2, axisymmetric MHD
simulations based on these equilibria are discussed. In particular, it is shown that the purely
elongated conﬁguration is unstable with respect to vertical displacements of the plasma, while the
D-shaped conﬁguration is vertically stable. 3D MHD simulations starting from the D-shaped
equilibrium are considered in the rest of the paper.
In Sec. 3.3, simulations without helical
MPs are reported. It is shown that with relatively small dissipation parameters a sawtoothing
dynamics is obtained, while the bifurcation to a stationary equilibrium with helical core occurs
at larger dissipation. In Sec. 3.4, the application of helical MPs in the case with spontaneous
sawtooth oscillations is considered. n = 1 MPs with varying poloidal periodicity m are applied,
and the eﬀect on the sawtoothing dynamics is analysed. Final remarks and future perspectives
are discussed in Sec. 4.

2 Numerical model

The numerical simulations reported in this paper are performed in toroidal geometry with the
nonlinear 3D MHD code pixie3d, which solves the compressible visco-resistive MHD equations
with ﬁnite β and heat transport [24, 25]. In this report, we run the code in the constant-density
and zero-β approximation, whose equations is dimensionless form are given by

Here, t is the time, ρ the uniform particle density, v the plasma velocity, B the magnetic ﬁeld,
E the electric ﬁeld, J the current density, η the resistivity, and ν the kinematic viscosity. The
magnetic ﬁeld is normalized to the on-axis toroidal magnetic ﬁeld B0, the density to the on-axis
√
ion mass density ρ0, lengths to the torus minor radius a, velocity and time to the on-axis Alfv´en
speed vA = B0/
µ0ρ0 and Alfv´en time tA = a/vA. In these units, the on-axis resistivity and
viscosity correspond to the inverse Lundquist number η0 = τA/τR ≡ S−1 and to the inverse
viscous Lundquist number ν0 = τA/τV ≡ M−1, τR and τV being the resistive and viscous time
scales. In this report, resistivity and viscosity are assigned as constant parameters. In particular,
ν is assumed to be uniform, while η is a prescribed function of the radius, to be discussed later.
No momentum source is included in Eq. 2 and all the perturbed harmonics have the same
angular phase, so that the net torque between MHD modes and the resulting mean plasma ﬂow
are zero. Eqs. 1-2 are actually the same equations solved by the specyl code in cylindrical
geometry [26, 19]. The nonlinear veriﬁcation benchmark between specyl and pixie3d in their
common limit of application has demonstrated that the two codes provide a highly accurate and
reliable solution of the 3D nonlinear visco-resistive MHD model [27].

pixie3d uses a ﬁnite-volume scheme for the spatial discretization of MHD equations and
fully-implicit temporal discretization schemes such as second-order Crank-Nicolson and backward-
diﬀerentiation-formula (BDF2) [24, 25]. A preconditioned Newton-Krylov method is employed
to solve the resulting set of nonlinear algebraic equations. The parallel version of the code
features excellent scalability properties [25]. pixie3d is written in a generalized curvilinear for-
mulation [24], which makes the code applicable to diﬀerent geometries, in particular cylindrical
and toroidal of interest for fusion plasmas simulations. The numerical simulations reported
in this paper are performed in toroidal geometry with circular cross-section and coordinates
(r, θ, φ), where r is the radius and θ and φ the poloidal and toroidal angles. R0 and a are the
major and minor radii of the torus, so that R = R0 + a cos θ and Z = a sin θ are the positions
with respect to the central axis and the equatorial plane. We are going to study shaped tokamak
plasmas with aspect ratio A (cid:39) 2.5, relevant to present-days diverted tokamaks such as DIII-D,
ASDEX-Upgrade and JT60-SA. To get this plasma aspect ratio, the aspect ratio of the circular
toroidal domain is set to R0/a = 1.65.

The imposed boundary conditions at r = a are such that Eθ(a) = 0, which implies that
the total toroidal magnetic ﬂux Φ0 is conserved in time. The edge toroidal electric ﬁeld is
Eφ(a) = E0/R, where E0 is the constant externally imposed toroidal electric ﬁeld. No-slip
boundary conditions are used for the edge tangential velocity, while the edge radial velocity is
vr(a) = E0(eφ×B)·er/B2 [28]. From the radial component of the Faraday equation ∂B
∂t = −∇×E
together with the boundary conditions on Eθ and Eφ, it follows that the edge radial magnetic
ﬁeld Br(a) is constant in time. The desired boundary condition on Br(a) is obtained with a
proper initial perturbation of the total magnetic ﬁeld, which must satisfy ∇ · B = 0 and whose
edge radial component will be conserved in time. The initial magnetic perturbation is prescribed
in terms of the toroidal periodicity m, poloidal periodicity n and amplitude of the corresponding
Fourier harmonics in the geometrical angles θ and φ. In this paper, static Br(a) perturbations
are applied with both n = 0 and n (cid:54)= 0 toroidal periodicities. In particular, large n = 0 MPs
provide the target axisymmetric plasma shaping, while smaller n (cid:54)= 0 perturbations mimic the
eﬀect of non-axisymmetric coils. We note that, from the physical point of view, the above
boundary conditions on the edge electric and magnetic ﬁelds can be regarded as a continuous
distribution of saddle coils located just inside a perfectly conducting wall.

The initial condition of pixie3d simulations is provided by the iterative solution of the Grad-

4

Shafranov equation J × B = 0 and the parallel Ohm’s law E · B = ηJ · B, with the assumption
of a circular magnetic boundary Br(a) = 0. The externally imposed toroidal electric ﬁeld E0
and the radial resistivity proﬁle are chosen in such a way that the initial safety factor proﬁle
takes a tokamak form, as also used for instance in Refs. [29, 30],

3 Shaped tokamak 3D MHD simulations

3.1 Shaped axisymmetric equilibria

In this paper, tokamak simulations are reported based on two diﬀerent shaped axisymmetric
equilibria, obtained by initial n = 0 magnetic ﬁeld perturbations whose edge radial component
will be conserved in time due to the above-mentioned boundary conditions. The ﬁrst is a purely
elongated equilibrium, with perturbation of the m/n = 2/0 Fourier harmonic of the magnetic
ﬁeld with edge amplitude (cid:61)b2/0
(a) = 8% of the on-axis toroidal ﬁeld B0. The second is a D-
shaped equilibrium which includes triangularity as well, and is obtained by the perturbation of
both the 2/0 harmonic with amplitude (cid:61)b2/0
(a) =
−8%. Only the imaginary parts of the Br harmonics are perturbed because in real space they
correspond to the sin(mθ) component, which is the one required to get up-down symmetric
magnetic conﬁgurations.

To compute the resulting axisymmetric equilibria, pixie3d simulations with the two diﬀerent
initial axisymmetric perturbations are performed. The simulations use a 2D mesh with 128
points in the radial direction and 64 points in the poloidal one, and dissipation parameters
S = 106 and M = 3.3 × 104. After around 100 Alfv´en times, a self-consistent equilibrium
conﬁguration is obtained in both cases. Such equilibrium conﬁgurations are shown in Fig. 1. In
both cases, the 1/0 Br harmonic (representing the Shafranov shift) is peaked in the core, while
the perturbed 2/0 and 3/0 harmonics increase towards the edge. The perturbed harmonics are
compared with the corresponding vacuum proﬁles, obtained from pixie3d simulations with the
same Br(a) perturbations but E0 = 0, S = 1 and M = 1, resulting in negligible J and v ﬁelds.
A signiﬁcant plasma ampliﬁcation with respect to the vacuum proﬁle is observed for the 2/0
harmonic. The amplitudes of the applied MPs are chosen so that a magnetic separatrix with two
X-points (i.e., a double-null diverted conﬁguration) is obtained in both cases. This is observed
by looking at the shape of the magnetic surfaces deﬁned by B · ∇Ψ = 0, where Ψ = 2πRAφ
is the poloidal magnetic ﬂux function and A is the vector potential in the Ar = 0 gauge. In
both cases, the O-point (i.e., the plasma magnetic axis) is outward shifted at r/a (cid:39) 0.05 and
the X-points are located around r/a = 0.8. The volume inside the magnetic separatrix is larger
in the D-shaped conﬁguration. The corresponding safety factor proﬁle q(Ψ) = dΦ
dΨ is also shown,
where Φ(Ψ) is the toroidal magnetic ﬂux within the magnetic surface labeled by Ψ. The safety
factor at the magnetic axis Ψ = 0 is quite close to 0.8, the on-axis value chosen for the circular

q(r) proﬁle in the absence of axisymmetric MPs. On the contrary, at the edge the eﬀect of the
axisymmetric MPs is signiﬁcant. In particular, the divergence of q is observed at the magnetic
separatrix Ψsep where dΨ = 0. The safety factor at 95% of the normalized poloidal ﬂux (q95),
is in the range between 4 and 6 as in typical experimental tokamak proﬁles.

3.2 Shaped axisymmetric simulations

The purely elongated conﬁguration turns out to be unstable with respect to the vertical insta-
bility, whose features are discussed in detail in Ref. [31]. The corresponding pixie3d simulation
with 2/0 MP is reported in Fig. 2. The real part of the 1/0 Br harmonic is negligible at the
beginning of the simulation, meaning that there is no cos(mθ) component of Br. However, such
component grows exponentially on an inertial time scale. After a few hundreds Alfv´en times,
the linear phase ends and the instability is nonlinearly saturated. When looking at the shape
of the magnetic surfaces, it is observed that around the end of the linear phase there is already
a signiﬁcant vertical displacement of the plasma but the lower X-point is still far from the wall.
At the beginning of the saturated phase the lower X-point is rather close to the wall, which is
eventually touched by the plasma with consequent loss of the diverted conﬁguration. No vertical

instability is observed in the case of the D-shaped conﬁguration. In fact, the pixie3d simulation
with both 2/0 and 3/0 MPs (whose temporal evolution is not shown here) predicts a stable 1/0
vertical mode.

The properties of the two considered axisymmetric conﬁgurations are in qualitative agree-
ment with the stability analysis for an elongated cylindrical plasma surrounded by an ideal wall
as reported in Ref. [31]. Such analysis predicts that the axisymmetric mode is stable provided
that the elongation is suﬃciently small and the plasma is close enough to the ideal wall. The
elongated conﬁguration considered in this report turns out to be marginally unstable according
to the stability condition given in terms of the vertical and horizontal plasma radii and the dis-
tance from the wall. The fact that the D-shaped conﬁguration is stable is also reasonable, since
the elongation is lower in that case and, in addition, the eﬀect of triangularity is stabilizing.

3.3 D-shaped 3D simulations without helical MPs

We now discuss fully 3D simulations based on the D-shaped equilibrium conﬁguration. These
simulations use a 3D mesh with 128 points in the radial direction, 64 points in the poloidal angle
and 64 points in the toroidal one. As discussed in Ref. [27], a mesh with 64 angular points is
adequate to support both m = 1 and higher-m harmonics. In this Section, simulations with no
further MPs in addition to the n = 0 required for axisymmetric plasma shaping are considered.
We ﬁrst describe a simulation with S = 106 and M = 3.3 × 104, as reported in Fig. 3. Quasi-
periodic sawtooth oscillations associated with the internal kink mode are observed in this case.
The dynamics is similar to the one previously observed in circular tokamak simulations with

quantities as in Fig. 3.

specyl and pixie3d codes [27, 14, 23]. The safety factor at the magnetic axis Ψ = 0 undergoes
sawtooth oscillations in the range from q(0) (cid:39) 0.9 to q(0) (cid:39) 1. These oscillations are ruled by
the nonlinear MHD dynamics of the internal kink mode, whose principal spectral component is
the 1/1 Fourier harmonic. The core amplitude of the 1/1 Br harmonic grows during slow phases
with decreasing q(0) < 1 until a sudden jump to q(0) (cid:39) 1 is triggered. Then, the amplitude of the
internal kink crashes and the cycle starts again. Only the imaginary part of the Br harmonics is
shown since the real part is zero throughout the simulation. This is because the initial velocity
perturbation that triggers the internal kink instability is applied in such a way to produce a
sin(mθ − nφ) component in Br and, due to the properties of the visco-resistive MHD equations,
this phase condition is conserved in time. The conﬁguration at a time of maximum internal
kink mode amplitude is characterized by a rather ﬂat q(Ψ) proﬁle inside the q = 1 rational
surface. The radial proﬁle of the 1/1 Br harmonic is peaked in the core and goes to zero outside
r/a (cid:39) 0.2. Other n = 1 Fourier harmonics are also present, which in this reference simulation
case are mainly due to the toroidal and geometric couplings with the principal 1/1 harmonic.
The corresponding Poincar´e plot at constant toroidal angle, computed with the ﬁeld-line tracing
code nemato [32], is characterized by the presence of a large magnetic island formed by the
internal kink mode. The island is close to completely reconnecting the magnetic ﬂux within the
q = 1 surface, after which nested magnetic surfaces would be recovered. Due to the phase of the
seed magnetic ﬂuctuation that would survive the crash, the island would grow on the opposite
side of the magnetic axis during the next sawtooth cycle. This π phase ﬂip spontaneously
occurs after each crash and is consistent with the sign reversal in the temporal evolution of the
imaginary component of the core 1/1 Br harmonic. Secondary islands with almost negligible
width are observed in the Poincar´e plot at major rational surfaces. They are transiently induced
by the internal kink mode at its largest amplitude via the toroidal and geometric couplings.

As already shown by specyl and pixie3d tokamak simulations in cylindrical geometry, if
the visco-resistive dissipation is increased a stationary conﬁguration is obtained with a saturated
island in the core [27]. The same feature is recovered here, as reported in Fig. 4 corresponding

resulting from the corresponding “vacuum” pixie3d simulations with E0 = 0, S = 1 and M = 1.

to a simulation with S = 105 and M = 104. In this case, the initial oscillations in q(0) and in the
core amplitude of the 1/1 Br harmonic are damped and a stationary conﬁguration with q(0) (cid:39)
0.95 and saturated internal kink mode is eventually obtained. The ﬁnal equilibrium conﬁguration
is characterized by the presence of a partially reconnected magnetic island associated with the
saturated internal kink mode.
In this D-shaped case, geometry-induced secondary magnetic
islands of small width are observed. This kind of stationary helical conﬁguration may be relevant
to experimental conditions where long-lived helical states are observed, such as the density snake
[2] or saturated ideal modes in advanced tokamak regimes [3]. However, a helical core without
a magnetic island is typically observed in such experimental conditions. As shown by ﬁnite-β
pixie3d simulations discussed in Ref. [23], these experimental regimes may be better described
by considering the pressure-driven branch of the internal kink mode.

3.4 D-shaped 3D simulations with helical MPs

We now focus on the simulation regime with small dissipation parameters and quasi-periodic
sawtooth oscillations, and discuss the eﬀect of applied MPs. In this report, MPs with n = 1
toroidal periodicity and diﬀerent poloidal periodicity from m = 1 to m = 4 are considered. This
choice is consistent with previous circular tokamak studies [14, 23]. We ﬁrst look at the case
with a 1/1 MP with amplitude (cid:61)b1/1
r = 0.1% of the on-axis toroidal ﬁeld B0, as reported in
Fig. 5. Similarly to what shown for the circular tokamak [14, 23], MPs with same periodicity
as the internal kink mode mitigate the sawtoothing activity. In fact, the average period and the
range of the q(0) sawtooth oscillations are signiﬁcantly reduced with respect to the reference
case. At a time of maximum internal kink amplitude, the radial proﬁle of the 1/1 Br harmonic
is characterized by the usual peak in the core. In this case, the Br proﬁle is not zero outside
the peak, but increases towards the edge to match the amplitude of the applied MP. The radial
proﬁle of the vacuum 1/1 Br harmonic is also shown. The vacuum harmonic is larger than

9

Figure 6: D-shaped 3D simulation with S = 106, M = 3.3 × 104 and 2/1 MPs. Same quantities
as in Fig. 5.

the plasma harmonic at the edge. This means that the plasma is partially screening the MP,
even in the absence of a mean plasma ﬂow.
It is also interesting to note that the external
perturbation clamps the phase of the internal kink. In fact, the core 1/1 Br amplitude reverses
after each crash as in the reference case, but now it reverses again shortly after and always
grows positive. The edge m = 1 perturbation exerts some eﬀect on other harmonics too. In
particular, the 2/1 Br harmonic is much larger than in the reference case, and it is ﬁnite not
only during the sawtooth crashes but throughout the entire simulation. This is probably due
to both a geometric coupling eﬀect and to a change in the linear stability of the 2/1 tearing
mode, which appears to be close to its stability threshold in this equilibrium conﬁguration. The
corresponding Poincar´e plot is characterized by quite large secondary islands at major resonant
surfaces, like in particular the 2/1 magnetic island. In addition, magnetic chaos appears in the
edge region as a result of the overlapping of edge islands. The last closed magnetic surface is
located between the island chains at q = 3 and q = 4 resonances. A complete mitigation of
the sawtoothing activity could be achieved by further increasing the MP amplitude as in the
circular tokamak case [14]. However, in this D-shaped case the resulting level of chaos would be
too high to be experimentally relevant.

A similar sawtooth mitigation eﬀect is obtained with a 2/1 MP of the same amplitude, as
shown in Fig. 6. In this case, the radial Br proﬁle of the perturbed 2/1 harmonic is close to
the vacuum solution near the wall, and it is largely ampliﬁed inside r/a = 0.5 by the clearly
unstable 2/1 tearing mode. The sawtooth mitigation eﬀect is not provided by the direct action
on the internal kink mode as in the previous case, but it comes from the action on the 2/1
tearing mode mediated by the toroidal coupling. In the circular tokamak study with qa (cid:39) 2
[14], the 1/1 MP was somehow more eﬀective than the 2/1 for the sawtooth mitigation. The
fact that in the present study the two perturbations are almost equivalent is reasonable since
here the edge q is larger and the q = 1 resonance is more internal, so that the direct 1/1 MP is
less eﬀective. As far as magnetic topology is concerned, the edge stochastization is stronger in
the 2/1 perturbation case. In fact, the last closed magnetic surface is now in between the island

10

chains at the q = 5/2 and q = 3 resonances.

A completely diﬀerent behaviour is observed in the case of 3/1 MP, as reported in Fig. 7.
In fact, the average period and the range of the q(0) sawtooth oscillations are larger than in
the reference case. The cause of this eﬀect is not clear at the moment.
Indeed, the plasma
ampliﬁcation of the perturbed 3/1 Br harmonic is relatively small, and the Br proﬁles inside
r/a = 0.5 are overall similar to the case with 1/1 MP. The level of edge chaos is also similar to
the 1/1 perturbation case. Finally, the case with 4/1 MP is shown in Fig. 8. The eﬀect of such
perturbation on the sawtooth oscillations turns out to be neglibigle in this case. In fact, the
MHD dynamics is quite similar to the reference case, including the spontaneous π phase ﬂips
after each crash. The radial Br proﬁle of the 4, 1 harmonic is rather close to the vacuum proﬁle,
meaning that the 4/1 mode is stable. The edge stochastization eﬀect is also rather limited. In
fact, a relatively narrow chaotic layer is oberved outside the island chain at the q = 5 resonance.

4 Final remarks and perspectives

In this paper, fully nonlinear 3D MHD simulations of shaped tokamak plasmas performed with
the pixie3d code in toroidal geometry have been reported. Plasma shaping is obtained by the
application of n = 0 perturbations of the circular magnetic boundary. If the amplitude of the
MP is large enough, shaped conﬁgurations with X-points can be obtained, of interest for diverted
tokamak studies. This approach makes possible to model the magnetic separatrix and even the
outside scrape-oﬀ layer with more ﬂexibility than MHD codes based on ﬂux coordinates. For
instance, an unrealistic truncation of the poloidal ﬂux close to the separatrix is required in the
mars code [33, 34]. A diverted, D-shaped equilibrium conﬁguration has been considered, and
the eﬀect of n = 1 MPs has been studied. Numerical results conﬁrm the sawtooth mitigation
eﬀect with 1/1 and 2/1 MPs found in previous circular tokamak simulations. A similar sawtooth
mitigation eﬀect with n = 1 MPs has been also observed in both RFX-mod [14] and DIII-D
tokamak plasmas [15]. Such investigations have been triggered by analogous experimental and

numerical ﬁndings in the RFP conﬁguration.

Although tokamak simulations in this report are performed in the zero-β regime and without
plasma rotation, these two approximations are going to be removed in the near future. Plasma
rotation is known to signiﬁcantly aﬀect the plasma response to resonant MPs, in particular by
suppressing the magnetic islands that would form at resonant surfaces [35]. The inclusion of
a source in the momentum balance equation has been recently implemented in pixie3d and
the eﬀect of the resulting mean toroidal ﬂow is going to be investigated. Finite β and the
heat transport equation are also going to be switched on, which are expected to aﬀect the
plasma equilibrium and the plasma response to MPs, and to possibly destabilize pressure-driven
modes. Two-ﬂuid [36] and kinetic [37] eﬀects on MHD modes are also increasingly important
when approaching realistic low-collisionality conditions. The coupling of pixie3d with a kinetic
module for fast particles, as in the hybrid hmgc code [38], will be considered in the future.
Overall, the above numerical advancements are expected to signiﬁcantly improve the predictive
capability of the numerical tool. Not only tokamak modelling, but also RFP and stellarator
studies [23] are going to greatly beneﬁt from such advancements.
