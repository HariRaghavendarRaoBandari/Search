space reduction, which can be applied to processes with asymptotically cou-
pled and uncoupled ﬁnite phase spaces.

1. Introduction

In this paper, we present new algorithms for construction asymptotic
expansions for stationary distributions of nonlinearly perturbed semi-Markov
processes with a ﬁnite phase space.

We consider models, where the phase space of embedded Markov chains
for pre-limiting perturbed semi-Markov processes is one class of communica-
tive states, while the phase space for the limiting embedded Markov chain can
consist of one or several closed classes of communicative states and, possibly,
a class of transient states.

The initial perturbation conditions are formulated in the forms of Taylor
asymptotic expansions for transition probabilities of the corresponding em-
bedded Markov chains and Laurent asymptotic expansions for expectations

of sojourn times for perturbed semi-Markov processes. Two forms of these
expansions are considered, with remainders given without or with explicit
upper bounds.

The algorithms are based on special time-space screening procedures for
sequential phase space reduction and algorithms for re-calculation of asymp-
totic expansions and upper bounds for remainders, which constitute pertur-
bation conditions for the semi-Markov processes with reduced phase spaces.
The ﬁnal asymptotic expansions for stationary distributions of nonlin-
early perturbed semi-Markov processes are given in the form of Taylor asymp-
totic expansions with remainders given without or with explicit upper bounds.
The model of perturbed Markov chains and semi-Markov processes, in
particular, in the most diﬃcult case of so-called singularly perturbed Markov
chains and semi-Markov processes with absorption and asymptotically un-
coupled phase spaces, attracted attention of researchers in the mid of the
20th century.

The ﬁrst works related to asymptotical problems for the above models are
Meshalkin (1958), Simon, and Ando (1961), Hanen (1963a, b, c, d), Seneta
(1967, 1968a, b), Schweitzer (1968), and Korolyuk (1969).

The methods used for construction of asymptotic expansions for station-
ary distributions and related functionals such as moments of hitting times
can be split in three groups.

The ﬁrst and the most widely used methods are based on analysis of gen-
eralized matrix and operator inverses of resolvent type for transition matrices
and operators for singularly perturbed Markov chains and semi-Markov pro-
cesses. Mainly models with linear, polynomial and analytic perturbations
have been objects of studies. We refer here to works by Schweitzer (1968),
Turbin (1972), Poliˇsˇcuk and Turbin (1973), Koroljuk, Brodi and Turbin
(1974), Pervozvanski˘ı and Smirnov (1974), Courtois and Louchard (1976),
Korolyuk and Turbin (1976, 1978), Courtois (1977), Latouche and Louchard
(1978), Kokotovi´c, Phillips and Javid (1980), Korolyuk, Penev and Turbin
(1981), Phillips and Kokotovi´c (1981), Delebecque (1983), Abadov (1984),
Silvestrov and Abadov (1984, 1991, 1993), Kartashov (1985d, 1988, 1996b),
Haviv (1986), Korolyuk (1989), Stewart and Sun (1990), Haviv, Ritov and
Rothblum (1992), Haviv and Ritov (1993), Schweitzer and Stewart (1993),
Stewart (1998, 2001), Yin and Zhang (1998, 2003, 2005, 2013), Avrachenkov
(1999, 2000), Avrachenkov and Lasserre (1999), Korolyuk, V.S. and Ko-
rolyuk, V.V. (1999), Yin, G., Zhang, Yang and Yin, K. (2001), Avrachenkov
and Haviv (2003, 2004), Craven (2003), Bini, Latouche and Meini (2005),

Korolyuk and Limnios (2005) and Avrachenkov, Filar and Howlett (2013).

Alternatively, the methods based on regenerative properties of Markov
chains and semi-Markov processes, in particular, relations which link sta-
tionary probabilities and expectations of return times have been used for
getting approximations for expectations of hitting times and stationary dis-
tributions in works by Grassman, Taksar and Heyman (1985), Hassin and
Haviv (1992) and Hunter (2005). Also, the above mentioned relations and
methods based on asymptotic expansions for nonlinearly perturbed regener-
ative processes developed in works by Silvestrov (1995, 2007, 2010), Englund
and Silvestrov (1997), Gyllenberg and Silvestrov (1998, 1999a, 2000a, 2008),
Englund (2000, 2001), Ni, Silvestrov and Malyarenko (2008), Ni (2010a, b,
2011, 2012, 2014), Silvestrov and Petersson (2013) and Petersson (2013a, b,
2014) have been used for getting asymptotic expansions for stationary and
quasi-stationary distributions for nonlinearly perturbed Markov chains and
semi-Markov processes with absorption.

Aggregation/disaggregation methods based on various modiﬁcation of
Gauss elimination method and space screening procedures for perturbed
Markov chains have been employed for approximation of stationary distribu-
tions for Markov chains in works by Coderch, Willsky, Sastry and Casta˜non
(1983), Delebecque (1983), Ga˘ıtsgori and Pervozvanski˘ı (1983), Chatelin and
Miranker (1984), Courtois and Semal (1984b), Seneta (1984), Cao and Stew-
art (1985), Vantilborgh (1985), Feinberg and Chiu (1987), Haviv (1987, 1992,
1999), Sumita and Reiders (1988), Meyer (1989), Schweitzer (1991), Stewart
and Zhang (1991), Stewart (1993a), Kim and Smith (1995) and Avrachenkov,
Filar and Howlett (2013), Silvestrov, D, and Silvestrov S. (2015).

We would like to mention that the present paper contains also a more
extended bibliography of works in the area supplemented by short biblio-
graphical remarks given in the last section of the paper.

In the present paper, we combine methods based on stochastic aggrega-
tion/disaggregation approach with methods based on asymptotic expansions
for perturbed regenerative processes applied to perturbed semi-Markov pro-
cesses.

In the above mentioned works based on stochastic aggregation/disaggrega-
tion approach, space screening procedures for discrete time Markov chains
are used. A Markov chain with a reduced phase space is constructed from
the initial one as the sequence of its states at sequential moment of hitting
into the reduced phase space. Times between sequential hitting of a reduced
phase space are ignored. Such screening procedure preserves ratios of hitting

3

frequencies for states from the reduced phase space and, thus, the ratios of
stationary probabilities are the same for the initial and the reduced Markov
chains. This implies that the stationary probabilities for the reduced Markov
chain coincide with the corresponding stationary probabilities for the initial
Markov chain up to the change of the corresponding normalizing factors.

We use another more complex type of time-space screening procedures for
semi-Markov processes. In this case, a semi-Markov process with a reduced
phase space is constructed from the initial one as the sequence of its states at
sequential moment of hitting into the reduced phase space and times between
sequential jumps of the reduced semi-Markov process are times between se-
quential hitting of the reduced space by the initial semi-Markov process.
Such screening procedure preserves transition times between states from the
reduced phase space, i.e., these times and, thus, their expectations are the
same for the initial and the reduced semi-Markov processes.

We also formulate perturbation conditions in terms of asymptotic expan-
sions for transition characteristics of perturbed semi-Markov processes. The
remainders in these expansions and, thus, the transition characteristics of
perturbed semi-Markov processes can be non-analytical functions of pertur-
bation parameters that makes diﬀerence with the results for models with
linear, polynomial and analytical perturbations.

We employ the methods of asymptotic analysis for nonlinearly perturbed
regenerative processes developed in works by Silvestrov (1995, 2007, 2010)
and Gyllenberg and Silvestrov (1998, 1999a, 2000a, 2008). However, we use
techniques of more general Laurent asymptotic expansions instead of Taylor
asymptotic expansions used in the above mentioned works and combine these
methods with the aggregation/disaggregation approach instead of using the
approach based on generalized matrix inverses. This permits us consider
perturbed semi-Markov processes with an arbitrary communication structure
of the phase space for the limiting semi-Markov process, including the general
case, where this phase space may consist from one or several closed classes
of communicative states and possibly a class of transient states.

Another new element is that we consider asymptotic expansions with
remainders given not only in the form o(·), but, also, with explicit upper
bounds.

It should be mentioned that the semi-Markov setting is an adequate and
necessary element of the method proposed in the paper. Even in the case,
where the initial process is a discrete or continuous time Markov chain, the
time-space screening procedure of phase space reduction results in a semi-

4

Markov process, since times between sequential hitting of the reduced space
by the initial process have distributions which can diﬀer of geometrical or
exponential ones.

Also, the use of Laurent asymptotic expansions for expectations of so-
journ times of perturbed semi-Markov processes is also a necessary element
of the method. Indeed, even in the case, where expectations of sojourn times
for all states of the initial semi-Markov process are asymptotically bounded
and represented by Taylor asymptotic expansions, the exclusion of an asymp-
totically absorbing state from the initial phase space can cause appearance
of states with asymptotically unbounded expectations of sojourn times rep-
resented by Laurent asymptotic expansions, for the reduced semi-Markov
processes.

The method proposed in the paper can be considered as a stochastic ana-
logue of the Gauss elimination method. It is based on the procedure of se-
quential exclusion of states from the phase space of a perturbed semi-Markov
process accompanied by re-calculation of asymptotic expansions penetrat-
ing perturbation conditions for semi-Markov processes with reduced phase
spaces. The corresponding algorithms are based on some kind of “opera-
tional calculus” for Laurent asymptotic expansions with remainders given in
two forms, without or with explicit upper bounds.

The corresponding computational algorithms have an universal character.
As was mentioned above, they can be applied to perturbed semi-Markov
processes with an arbitrary communicative structure and are computationally
eﬀective due to recurrent character of computational procedures.

In conclusion, we would like to point out that, by our opinion, the re-
sults presented in the paper have a good potential for continuation of studies
(asymptotic expansions for high order power and exponential moments for
hitting times, aggregated time-space screening procedures, asymptotic ex-
pansions for quasi-stationary distributions, etc.). We comment some prospec-
tive directions for future studies in the end of the paper.

The paper includes 8 sections. In Section 2, we present so-called opera-
tional rules for Laurent asymptotic expansions. In Section 3, we formulate
basic perturbation conditions for Markov chains and semi-Markov processes.
In Section 4, we give basic formulas for stationary distributions for semi-
Markov processes, in particular, formulas connecting stationary distributions
with expectations of return times. In Section 5, we present an one-step pro-
cedure of phase space reduction for semi-Markov processes.
In Section 6,
we present algorithms for re-calculation of asymptotic expansions for transi-

5

tion characteristics of perturbed semi-Markov processes with a reduced phase
space. In Section 7, we present algorithms of sequential reduction of phase
space for semi-Markov processes and construction of asymptotic expansions
for stationary distributions. In Section 8, we present some directions for fu-
ture studies and short bibliographical remarks concerned works in the area.
We would like to conclude the introduction with the remark that the
present paper is a slightly improved version of the research report Silvestrov,
D. and Silvestrov S. (2015).

2. Laurent asymptotic expansions

In this section, we present so-called operational rules for Laurent asymp-
totic expansions. We consider the corresponding results as possibly known,
except, some of explicit formulas for remainders, in particular, those related
to product, reciprocal and quotient rules.

2.1. Deﬁnition of Laurent asymptotic expansions. Let A(ε) be a
real-valued function deﬁned on an interval (0, ε0], for some 0 < ε0 ≤ 1, and
given on this interval by a Laurent asymptotic expansion,

A(ε) = ahAεhA + · · · + akAεkA + oA(εkA),

(1)

where (a) −∞ < hA ≤ kA < ∞ are integers, (b) the coeﬃcients ahA, . . . , akA
are real numbers, (c) function oA(εkA)/εkA → 0 as ε → 0.

We refer to such Laurent asymptotic expansion as a (hA, kA)-expansion.
We say that (hA, kA)-expansion A(ε) is pivotal if it is known that ahA 6= 0.
We also say that (hA, kA)-expansion A(ε) is a (hA, kA, δA, GA, εA)-expansi-
on if its remainder oA(εkA) satisﬁes the following inequalities (d) |oA(εkA)|
≤ GAεkA+δA, for 0 < ε ≤ εA, where (e) 0 < δA ≤ 1, 0 < GA < ∞ and
0 < εA ≤ ε0.

In what follows, [a] is the integer part of a real number a.
Also, the indicator of relation A = B is denoted as I(A = B). It equals

to 1, if A = B, or 0, if A 6= B.

It is useful to note that there is no sense to consider, it seems, a more
general case of upper bounds for the remainder oA(εkA), with parameter
δA > 1.
A =
δA − [δA] + I(δA = [δA]) ∈ (0, 1].

A = kA + [δA] − I(δA = [δA]) and δ′

Indeed, let us deﬁne k′

The (hA, kA, δA, GA, εA)-expansion (1) can be re-written in the equivalent

6

form of the (hA, k′

A, δ′

A, GA, εA)-expansion,

A(ε) = ahAεhA + · · · + akAεkA + 0εkA+1 + · · · + 0εk′

A, for 0 < ε ≤ εA.

A) = oA(εkA), which satisﬁes inequalities

Relation (2) implies that the asymptotic expansion A(ε) can be repre-
sented in diﬀerent forms. In such cases, we consider a more informative form
with larger parameters hA and kA. As far as parameters δA, GA and εA are
concerned, we consider as a more informative form, ﬁrst, with larger value of
parameter δA, second, with smaller values of parameter GA and, third, with
the larger values of parameter εA.

In what follows, a ∨ b = max(a, b) and a ∧ b = min(a, b), for real numbers

a and b.

2.2. Operational rules for Laurent asymptotic expansions. Let us
consider four Laurent asymptotic expansions, A(ε) = ahAεhA + · · · + akAεkA +
oA(εkA), B(ε) = bhB εhB + · · · + bkB εkB + oB(εkB), C(ε) = chC εhC + · · · +
ckC εkC + oC(εkC ), and D(ε) = dhDεhD + · · · + dkD εkD + oD(εkD) deﬁned for
0 < ε ≤ ε0, for some 0 < ε0 ≤ 1.

The following lemma presents “operational” rules for Laurent asymptotic

expansions.

Lemma 3. The above asymptotic expansions have the following opera-

tional rules for computing coeﬃcients:

(i) If A(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε0] is a (hA, kA)-expansion and c is a constant, then
C(ε) = cA(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε0] is a (hC, kC)-expansion with parameters hC =
hA, kC = kA and coeﬃcients,

chC +r = cahC +r, r = 0, . . . , kC − hC.

(7)

This expansion is pivotal if and only if chC = cahA 6= 0.

(ii) If A(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε0] is a (hA, kA)-expansion and B(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε0] is a
(hB, kB)-expansion, then C(ε) = A(ε) + B(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε0] is a (hC, kC)-
expansion with parameters hC = hA∧hB, kC = kA∧kB, and coeﬃcients,

chC +r = ahC +r + bhC +r, r = 0, . . . , kC − hC,

(8)

9

where ahC +r = 0 for 0 ≤ r < hA − hC and bhC +r = 0 for 0 ≤ r <
hB − hC .

This expansion is pivotal if and only if chC = ahC + bhC 6= 0.

(iii) If A(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε0] is a (hA, kA)-expansion and B(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε0] is a
(hB, kB)-expansion, then C(ε) = A(ε) · B(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε0] is a (hC, kC)-
expansion with parameters hC = hA + hB, kC = (hA + kB) ∧ (hB + kA),
and coeﬃcients,

chC +r = X0≤i≤r

ahA+ibhB +r−i, r = 0, . . . , kC − hC.

(9)

This expansion is pivotal if and only if chC = ahAbhB 6= 0.

(iv) If B(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε0] is a pivotal (hB, kB)-expansion, then there exists 0 <
ε′
0 ≤ ε0 such that B(ε) 6= 0, ε ∈ (0, ε′
0] is
a pivotal (hC, kC)-expansion with parameters hC = −hB, kC = kB−2hB

(v) If A(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε0] is a (hA, kA)-expansion B(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε0] is a pivotal
(hB, kB)-expansion, then, there exists 0 < ε′

In what follows, the following two lemmas, which present recurrent op-
erational rules for computing coeﬃcients and remainders for multiple sum-
mations and multiplications of Laurent asymptotic expansions, will also be
used. These lemmas are direct corollaries of Lemmas 3 and 4.

Let Am(ε) = ahAm ,mεhAm + · · · + akAm ,mεkAm + o(εkAm ), ε ∈ (0, ε0] be a
(hAm, kAm)-expansion, for m = 1, . . . , N, Bn(ε) = A1(ε) + · · · + An(ε), ε ∈
(0, ε0], and Cn(ε) = A1(ε) × · · · × An(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε0], for n = 1, . . . , N.

The following two lemmas follow, respectively, from Lemmas 3 and 4 and
recurrent relations Bn(ε) = Bn−1(ε) + An(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε0], n = 2, . . . , N and
Cn(ε) = Cn−1(ε) · An(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε0], n = 2, . . . , N, which hold for any N ≥ 2.
Lemma 5. The above asymptotic expansions have the following opera-

tional rules for computing coeﬃcients:

(i) If Am(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε0] is a (hAm, kAm)-expansion for m = 1, . . . , N where
N ≥ 2, then Bn(ε) = bhBn ,nεhBn + · · · + bkBn ,nεkBn + o(εkBn ), ε ∈ (0, ε0]
is a (hBn, kBn)-expansion, for n = 1, . . . , N , with hB1 = hA1, kB1 =
kA1 and hBn = min(hA1, . . ., hAn) = hBn−1 ∧ hAn, kBn = min(kA1,
. . . , kAn) = kBn−1 ∧ kAn, n = 2, . . . , N and the coeﬃcients given by
formulas bhB1 +l,1 = ahA1 +l,1, l = 0, . . . , kB1 − hB1 = kA1 − hA1 and, for
l = 0, . . . , kBn − hBn, n = 2, . . . , N , by formulas,

bhBn +l,n = ahBn +l,1 + · · · + ahBn +l,n,

(19)

or

bhBn +l,n = bhBn−1 +l,n−1 + ahBn +l,n,

(20)

where bhBn−1 +l,n−1 = 0, l = 0, . . ., hBn−1 − hBn and ahBn +l,m = 0, l =
0, . . . hAm − hBn, m = 1, . . . , n.
Expansions Bn(ε), n = 1, . . . , N are pivotal if and only if bhBn ,n =
ahA1 ,1 + · · · + ahAn ,n 6= 0, n = 1, . . . , N .

(ii) If Am(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε0] is a (hAm, kAm)-expansion for m = 1, . . . , N where
N ≥ 2, then Cn(ε) = chCn ,nεhCn + · · · + ckCn ,nεkCn + o(εkCn ), ε ∈ (0, ε0]
is a (hCn, kCn)-expansion, for n = 1, . . . , N , with hC1 = hA1, kC1 =

(iii) Asymptotic expansions for functions Bn(ε) = A1(ε) + · · · + An(ε), n =

invariant with respect to any permutation, respectively, of summation
and multiplication order in the above formulas (23) and (25).

It should be noted that formulas (23) and (25) give, in general, the values,
which are less or equal than the values for these constants given in alternative
formulas, respectively, (24) and (26).

2.3. Proofs of Lemmas 1–6. The formulas given in Lemmas 1 and 2
are quite obvious. The same relate to formulas and in propositions (i) – (ii)
(the multiplication by a constant and summation rules) of Lemmas 3 and
4. They can be obtained by simple accumulation of coeﬃcients for diﬀerent
powers of ε and terms accumulated in the corresponding remainders, as well
obvious upper bounds for absolute values of sums of terms accumulated in
the corresponding remainders. Lemmas 5 and 6 are corollaries of Lemmas 3
and 4.

Let us, therefore, give short proofs of propositions (iii) – (v) of Lemmas

3 and 4.

Multiplication of asymptotic expansions A(ε) and B(ε) penetrating propo-
sition (iii) of Lemmas 3 and accumulation of coeﬃcients for powers εl for
l = hC, . . . , kC yields the following relation,

C(ε) = A(ε)B(ε)

(29)

It should be noted that the accumulation of coeﬃcients for powers εl can
be made in (27) only up to the maximal value l = kC = (hA +kB)∧(hB +kA),
because of the presence in the expression for the remainder oC(εkC ) terms
bhB εhBoA(εkA) and ahAεhAoB(εkB).

Also, relation (28) readily implies relation (15), which determines param-

eters δC, GC, εC in proposition (iii) of Lemma 4.

The assumptions of proposition (iv) in Lemma 3 imply that the following

relation holds,

ε−hBB(ε) → bhB 6= 0 as 0 < ε → 0.

(30)

This relation implies that there exists 0 < ε′

0 ≤ ε0 such that B(ε) 6= 0 for

ε ∈ (0, ε′

0], and, thus, function C(ε) = 1

B(ε) is well deﬁned for ε ∈ (0, ε′
The assumptions of proposition (iv) of Lemmas 3 also imply that,

(31)

This relation means that function εhBC(ε) can be represented in the form
, or, equivalently, that the following

εhBC(ε) = chC + o(1), where chC = b−1
hB
representation holds,

where

C(ε) = chC ε−hB + C1(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε′

0],

C1(ε)
ε−hB

→ 0 as 0 < ε → 0.

(32)

(33)

Relations (32) and (33) prove proposition (iv) of Lemmas 3 for the case,
where hB = kB that is equivalent to the relation hC = −hB = kC = kB −2hB.

19

Note that, in the case hB = kB, the asymptotic expansion (32) for func-

tion C(ε) can not be extended. Indeed,

Let us now assume that hB + 1 = kB that is equivalent to the relation

hC = −hB = kC − 1 = kB − 2hB − 1.

In this case, the assumptions of proposition (iv) of Lemma 3 and relations

(32), (33) and (34) imply that

εhB−1C1(ε) = εhB−1(C(ε) − chC ε−hB)

(35)

This relation means that function εhB−1C1(ε) can be represented in the
bhB +1chC , or, equivalently,

form εhB−1C1(ε) = chC +1 + o(1), where chC +1 = b−1
hB
that the following representation holds,

C(ε) = chC ε−hB + chC +1ε−hB+1 + C2(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε′

0],

where

C2(ε)
ε−hB+1 → 0 as 0 < ε → 0.

(36)

(37)

Relations (36) and (37) yields proposition (iv) of Lemmas 3 for the case,

where hB + 1 = kB.

Note that, in the case hB + 1 = kB, the asymptotic expansion (36) for

function C(ε) can not be extended. Indeed,

εhB−2C2(ε) = εhB−2(C(ε) − chC ε−hB − chC +1ε−hB+1)

= −

Repeating the above arguments, we can prove that function C(ε) can be
represented in the form of (hC, kC)-expansion, with parameters hC, kC and
coeﬃcients chC , . . . , ckC given in proposition (iii) of Lemma 3, for the general
case, where hB +n = kB, or, equivalently, hC = −hB = kC −n = kB −2hB −n,
for any n = 0, 1, . . ..

The (hC, kC)-expansion for function C(ε) = 1

B(ε) can be rewritten in the

equivalent form of the following relation,

1 = (bhB ehB + · · · + bkB εkB + oB(εkB))(chC + · · · + chC εkC + oC(εkC )), (39)

Proposition (iii) of Lemma 3, applied to the product on the right hand
side in (39), permits to represent this product in the form of (h, k)-expansion
with parameters h = hB +hC = hB −hB = 0 and k = (hB +kC)∧(kB +hC) =
(kB − hB) ∧ (kB − 2hB + hB) = kB − hB.

By canceling coeﬃcient for εl on the left and right hand sides in (39),
for l = 0, . . . , kB − hB and then solving equation (39) with respect to the
remainder oC(εkC ) permits to ﬁnd the following formula for this remainder,

This inequality proofs the proposition (iv) of Lemma 4.
The ﬁrst statement of proposition (v) in Lemma 3 states that function
D(ε) can be represented as (hD, kD)-expansion with parameters hD, kD and
coeﬃcients dhd, . . . , dkD given in this proposition and relation (11). It is the
direct corollary of propositions (iii) and (iv) of Lemma 3, which, just, should
be applied to the product D(ε) = A(ε) ·

Note that, in this case, parameters hD = hA + hC = hA − hB and kD =

(kA + hC) ∧ (hA + kC) = (kA − hB) ∧ (hA + kB − 2hB).

Now, when it is already proved that D(ε) is (hD, kD)-expansion, its coef-
ﬁcients can be also computed by equalising coeﬃcients for for powers εl for
l = hD, . . . , kD on the left and right hand sides of relation,

This procedure yields the second statement of proposition (v) in Lemma

3 and the corresponding formulas given in relation (12).

The ﬁrst statement of proposition proposition (v) in Lemma 4 and re-

2.4. Algebraic and related properties of operational rules for
Laurent asymptotic expansions. Let us also introduce parameter wA =
kA −hA, which is a length of a Laurent asymptotic expansion A(ε) = ahεhA +
· · · + akεkA + oA(εkA).

The following useful lemma takes place.
Lemma 7. The following relations hold for Laurent asymptotic expan-

sions penetrating Lemma 3:

23

(i) If C(ε) = cA(ε), then wC = wA.

(ii) If C(ε) = A(ε) + B(ε), then wA ∧ wB ≤ wC ≤ wA ∨ wB.

(iii) If C(ε) = A(ε) · B(ε), then wC = wA ∧ wB.

(iv) If C(ε) = 1/B(ε), then wC = wB.

(v) If D(ε) = A(ε)/B(ε), then wD = wA ∧ wB.

(vi) If wA = wB = w then wC = wD = w for all Laurent asymptotic

expansions penetrating Lemma 3.

The proof of this simple lemma readily follows from formulas for param-

eters h and k penetrating propositions (i) – (v) of Lemma 3.

Let us again consider four Laurent asymptotic expansions, A(ε) = ahAεhA+
· · · + akAεkA + oA(εkA), B(ε) = bhB εhB + · · · + bkB εkB + oB(εkB), C(ε) =
chC εhC + · · · + ckC εkC + oC(εkC ), and D(ε) = dhDεhD + · · · + dkD εkD + oD(εkD)
deﬁned for 0 < ε ≤ ε0, for some 0 < ε0 ≤ 1.

Below, sums Pk

l=h dl are counted as 0 if k < h.

The following lemma is also a corollary of Lemma 3.
Lemma 8. The summation and multiplication operations for the Lau-
rent asymptotic expansions penetrating propositions (ii) and (iii) in Lemma
3 possess the following algebraic properties, which should be understood as
identities for the corresponding asymptotic expansions:

(i) The summation operation is commutative, i.e., C(ε) = A(ε) + B(ε) =
B(ε) + A(ε), where hC = hA+B = hB+A = hA ∧ hB, kC = kA+B =

(ii) The summation operation is associative, i.e., D(ε) = (A(ε) + B(ε)) +
C(ε) = A(ε) + (B(ε) + C(ε)) = A(ε) + B(ε) + C(ε), where hD =
h(A+B)+C = hA+(B+C) = hA+B+C = hA ∧ hB ∧ hC, kD = k(A+B)+C =

chD+l = 0 for 0 ≤ l < hC − hD.

(iii) The multiplication operation is commutative, i.e., C(ε) = A(ε) · B(ε) =
B(ε) · A(ε), where hC = hA·B = hB·A = hA + hB, kC = kA·B = kB·A =

C(ε) = A(ε) · (B(ε) · C(ε)) = A(ε) · B(ε) · C(ε), where hD = h(A·B)·C =

The summation and multiplication rules for computing of upper bounds
remainders penetrating propositions (ii) and (iii) in Lemma 4 possess the

25

communicative property. This follows from formulas (23) and (25) given in
Lemma 6.

However, the summation and multiplication rules for computing of upper
bounds for remainders presented in propositions (ii) and (iii) of Lemma 4
do not possess associative and distributional properties. The question about
the form of upper bounds for the corresponding remainders, which would
possess these properties, remains open.

As follows from Lemma 4, operational rules presented in this lemma pos-
sess special property that let one give an eﬀective low bounds for parameter
δA for any (hA, kA, δA, GA, εA)-expansion A(ε) obtained as the result of a ﬁnite
sequence of operations (multiplication by a constant, summation, multipli-
cation, and division) performed with with (hAi, kAi, δAi, GAi, εAi)-expansions
Ai(ε), i = 1, . . . , N from some ﬁnite set of such expansions.

The following lemma takes place.
Lemma 9. The operational rules for computing remainders of asymptotic
expansions with explicit upper bounds for remainders presented in proposi-
tions (ii) and (iii) of Lemma 4 possess the following properties:

(i) If C(ε) = A(ε) + B(ε) = B(ε) + A(ε) then δC = δA+B = δB+A, GC =
GA+B = GB+A and εC = εA+B = εB+A, where parameters δC, GC and
εC are given by formula (14) in proposition (ii) of Lemma 4.

(ii) If C(ε) = A(ε) · B(ε) = B(ε) · A(ε) then δC = δA·B = δB·A, GC =
GA·B = GB·A and εC = εA·B = εB·A, where parameters δC, GC and εC
are given by formula (15) in proposition (iii) of Lemma 4.

(iii) If A(ε) is (hA, kA, δA, GA, εA)-expansion obtained as the result of a ﬁnite
sequence of operations (multiplication by a constant, summation, multi-
plication, and quotient) performed with (hAi, kAi, δAi, GAi, εAi)-expansi-
ons Ai(ε), i = 1, . . . , N from some ﬁnite set of such expansions, then

3. Perturbed Markov chains and semi-Markov processes

In this section, we formulate basic perturbation conditions for Markov

chains and semi-Markov processes.

3.1. Perturbed Markov chains. Let X = {1, . . . , N} and η(ε)

n , n =
0, 1, . . . be, for every ε ∈ (0, ε0], a homogeneous Markov chain with a phase

26

space X, an initial distribution p(ε)
probabilities deﬁned for i, j ∈ X,

i = P{η(ε)

0 = i}, i ∈ X and transition

pij(ε) = P{η(ε)

n+1 = j/η(ε)

n = i}.

(51)

Let us assume that the following condition holds:

A: There exist sets Yi ⊆ X, i ∈ X and ε0 ∈ (0, 1] such that: (a) prob-
abilities pij(ε) > 0, j ∈ Yi, i ∈ X, for ε ∈ (0, ε0]; (b) probabilities
pij(ε) = 0, j ∈ Yi, i ∈ X, for ε ∈ (0, ε0];
(c) there exist nij ≥ 1
and a chain of states i = lij,0, lij,1, . . . , lij,nij = j such that lij,1 ∈
Ylij,0, . . . , lij,nij ∈ Ylij,nij −1, for every pair of states i, j ∈ X.

We refer to sets Yi, i ∈ X as transition sets.
Conditions A implies that all sets Yi 6= ∅, i ∈ X, since matrix kpij(ε)k is

stochastic, for every ε ∈ (0, ε0].

We now assume that the following perturbation condition holds:

B: pij(ε) = P

trating the asymptotic expansions condition B, in order this condition would

for every ε ∈ (0, ε0], and with condition A.

Condition B implies that there exits ε0 ∈ (0, 1] such that the following

(52)

Thus, condition B is consistent with condition A (a).
The model assumption that matrix kpij(ε)k is stochastic is, under condi-

tions A (a) and (b), equivalent to the following relation,

pij(ε) = 1, j ∈ Yi, i ∈ X, ε ∈ (0, ε0].

Condition B and proposition (i) (the multiple summation rule) of Lemma

represented in the form of the following asymptotic expansion,

(57)

In terms of asymptotic expansions, constant 1 can be represented, for

every n = 0, 1, . . ., in the form of the following pivotal (0, n)-expansion,

1 = 1 + 0ε + · · · 0εn + on(εn),

(58)

where remainders on(εn) ≡ 0, n = 0, 1, . . ..

Moreover, the above expansion is a (0, n, 1, G, ε0)-expansion for any 0 <

G < ∞ and n = 0, 1, . . ..

Relation (53) permits us apply Lemma 2 to the asymptotic expansions
given in relations (54) and (58). Not that, in this case, l−
i,Yi = 0, otherwise
the expression on the right hand side in (54) would converge to zero as ε → 0.
Let us take n = l+
in the
i,Yi
asymptotic expansion given in relation (58).

in relation (58). In this case h1 = 0 and k1 = l+
i,Yi

Lemma 2 and the model stochasticity assumption (53) imply that, in this
case, the following condition should hold for the coeﬃcients of asymptotic
expansions penetrating condition B:

C: (a) ai,Yi[l] =Pj∈Yi

0, for 0 ≤ l < l−

aij[l] = I(l = 0), 0 ≤ l ≤ l+

Remark 1. It is possible to prove that conditions A – C and the model
stochasticity assumption (53) imply that the asymptotic expansion in (54)
satisfy, for every Z ⊆ Yi and i ∈ X, one of the following additional conditions:
(a) l−
i,Z = 0, ai,Z[0] = 1 and there exists
0 < li,Z ≤ l+
i,Z such that ai,Z[l] = 0, 0 < l < li,Z, but ai,Z[li,Z] < 0; or (d)

i,Z = 0, ai,Z[0] < 1; (c) l−

i,Z > 0; (b) l−

ai,Z[l]εl + oi,Z(εl+

The above proposition implies that there exists ε0 ∈ (0, 1] such that
l+
i,Z
i,Z) ≤ 1, Z ⊆ Yi, i ∈ X, ε ∈ (0, ε0]. Thus, conditions A
l=ˇl−
i,Z

P
– C are also consistent with the relations Pj∈Z pij(ε) ≤ 1, Z ⊆ Yi, i ∈ X, ε ∈

(0, ε0], which follows from the model stochasticity assumption (53).

In the case, where the asymptotic expansions penetrating condition B
are supposed to be given in the form of asymptotic expansions with explicit
upper bounds for remainders, we replace it by the following condition:

3.2. Perturbed semi-Markov processes. Let X = {1, . . . , N} and
(η(ε)
n , κ(ε)

i.e., a homogeneous Markov chain with the phase space X × [0, ∞), an initial

ij (t) = P{η(ε)

n+1 = j, κ(ε)

n+1 ≤ t/η(ε)

n = i, κ(ε)

(59)

In this case, the random sequence η(ε)

n , n = 0, 1, . . . is also a homogeneous
(embedded) Markov chain with the phase space X and transition probabilities
deﬁned for i, j ∈ X,

pij(ε) = P{η(ε)

n+1 = j/η(ε)

n = i} = Q(ε)

ij (∞).

(60)

We assume that condition A holds. This implies that Markov chain η(ε)

n

has one class of communicative states, for every ε ∈ (0, ε0].

We also assume that the following condition excluding instant transitions

holds:

29

D: Q(ε)

ij (0) = 0, i, j ∈ X, for every ε ∈ (0, ε0].

Let us now introduce a semi-Markov process,

η(ε)(t) = η(ε)

ν(ε)(t), t ≥ 0.

where

ν(ε)(t) = max(n ≥ 0 : ζ (ε)

n ≤ t), t ≥ 0,

is a number of jumps in the time interval [0, t], and

n = κ(ε)
ζ (ε)

1 + · · · + κ(ε)

n , n = 0, 1, . . . ,

(61)

(62)

(63)

are sequential moments of jumps for the semi-Markov process η(ε)(t).

If Q(ε)

ij (t) = (1 − e−λi(ε)t)pij(ε), t ≥ 0, i, j ∈ X, then η(ε)(t), t ≥ 0 is a

continuous time homogeneous Markov chain.

If Q(ε)

ij (t) = I(t ≥ 1)pij(ε), t ≥ 0, i, j ∈ X, then η(ε)(t) = η(ε)

[t] , t ≥ 0 is a

discrete time homogeneous Markov chain embedded in continuous time.

Let us also introduce expectations of sojourn times,

eij(ε) = Eiκ(ε)

tQ(ε)

ij (dt), i, j ∈ X.

(64)

We also assume that the following condition holds:

E: eij(ε) < ∞, i, j ∈ X, for ε ∈ (0, ε0].

Here and henceforth, notations Pi and Ei are used for conditional proba-

bilities and expectations under condition η(ε)

0 = i.

In the case of continuous time Markov chain, eij(ε) = 1
In the case of discrete time Markov chain, eij(ε) = pij(ε), i, j ∈ X.
Conditions A and D imply that, for every ε ∈ (0, ε0], expectations

λi(ε)pij(ε), i, j ∈ X.

eij(ε) > 0, for j ∈ Yi, i ∈ X, and eij(ε) = 0, for j ∈ Yi, i ∈ X.

We now assume that the following perturbation condition holds:

bij[l]εl + ˙oij(εm+

ij ), where bij[m−

ij] > 0 and −∞ < m−

j ∈ Yi, i ∈ X.

30

In particular, in the case of discrete time Markov chain, condition B im-
plies condition F to hold, since, in this case, expectations eij(ε) = pij(ε), j ∈
Yi, i ∈ X.

Condition F implies that there exits ε0 ∈ (0, 1] such that the following

relation holds,

eij(ε) > 0, j ∈ Yi, i ∈ X, ε ∈ (0, ε0].

(65)

This is consistent with condition D.
In the case, where the asymptotic expansions penetration condition F are
given in the form of asymptotic expansions with explicit upper bounds for
remainders, we assumer that the following condition holds:

It is also worse to note that the perturbation conditions B and F are

independent.

To see this,

let us take arbitrary functions pij(ε), j ∈ Yi, i ∈ X and
eij(ε), j ∈ Yi, i ∈ X satisfying, respectively, conditions B and F, and, also,
relations (52), (53) and (65). Then, there exist semi-Markov transition prob-

4. Stationary distributions for semi-Markov processes

In this section, we give basic formulas for stationary distributions for semi-
Markov processes, in particular, formulas connecting stationary distributions
with expectations of return times.

4.1. Stationary distributions for semi-Markov processes. Con-
dition A guarantees that the phase space X is one class of communicative
states for Markov chain η(ε)
n , for every ε ∈ (0, ε0], i.e., the Markov chain η(ε)
n
is ergodic, and, thus, for every ε ∈ (0, ε0], there exist the unique stationary

relation,

I(η(ε)

k = i) a.s.−→ ρi(ε) as n → ∞, i ∈ X.

It is useful to note that the ergodic relation (66) holds for any initial
N i and the stationary distribution ¯ρ(ε) does

distribution ¯p(ε) = hp(ε)
not depend on the initial distribution.

1 , . . . p(ε)

As known, ρi(ε), i ∈ X is the unique positive solution for the system of

linear equations,

( ρj(ε) =Pi∈X ρi(ε)pij(ε), j ∈ X,
Pi∈X ρi = 1.

Conditions A, D and E imply that, for every ε ∈ (0, ε0], the semi-Markov
process η(ε)(t) is also ergodic and its stationary distribution ¯π(ε) = hπ1(ε), . . .,
πN (ε)i is given by the following ergodic relation, for i ∈ X,

¯µ(ε)
i (t) =

1

t Z t

0

I(η(ε)(s) = i)ds a.s.−→ πi(ε) as t → ∞.

(68)

As in (66), the ergodic relation (68) holds for any initial distribution ¯p(ε)
and the stationary distribution ¯π(ε) does not depend on the initial distribu-
tion.

The stationary distributions for the semi-Markov process η(ε)(t) and the

embedded Markov chain η(ε)

n are connected by the following relation,

Matrix kpij(ε)k is stochastic, for every ε ∈ (0, ε0] and, thus, matrix

kpij(0)k is also stochastic.

However, it is possible that matrix kpij(0)k has more zero elements than

matrices kpij(ε)k.

Therefore, a Markov chain η(0)

n , n = 0, 1, . . ., with the phase space X and
the matrix of transition probabilities kpij(0)k can be not ergodic, and its
phase space X can consist of one or several closed classes of communicative
states plus, possibly, a class of transient states.
Condition F implies that there exist limits,

Out goal is to design an eﬀective algorithm for constructing asymptotic
expansions for stationary probabilities πi(ε), i ∈ X, under assumption that
conditions A – F hold.

As we shall se, the proposed algorithm, based on a special techniques
of sequential phase space reduction, can be applied for models with asymp-
totically coupled and uncoupled phase spaces and all types of asymptotic
behavior of expected sojourn times.

The models of continuous and discrete Markov chains are particular cases.
In particular, asymptotic expansions for stationary probabilities ρi(ε), i ∈
X coincide with expansions for stationary probabilities πi(ε), i ∈ X, for the
discrete time Markov chain, where expectations eij(ε) = pij(ε), i, j ∈ X.

4.2. Expected hitting times and stationary probabilities for
semi-Markov processes. Let us deﬁne hitting times, which are random

(76)

Moreover, under the above conditions, the expectations Eij(ε), i ∈ X
are, for every j ∈ X, the unique solution for the following system of linear
equations,

In fact this formula is an alternative form of relation (69). Indeed, as is

known, Eii(ε) = Pj∈X ej(ε)fii,j(ε), where fii,j(ε) is the expected number of

visits by the Markov chain η(ε)

Formula (78) permits reduce the problem of constructing asymptotic ex-
pansions for semi-Markov stationary probabilities πi(ε) to the problem of
constructing Laurent asymptotic expansions for expectation of hitting times
Eii(ε).

5. Semi-Markov processes with reduced phase spaces

In this section, we present a procedure for one-step procedure of phase

space reduction for semi-Markov processes.

5.1. Reduction of a phase space for semi-Markov process. Let us
choose some state r and consider the reduced phase space rX = {i ∈ X, i 6=
r}, with the state r excluded from the phase space X.

Let us assume that p(ε)

0 = r} = 0 and deﬁne the sequential
moments of hitting the reduced space rX by the embedded Markov chain
η(ε)
n ,

r = P{η(ε)

rξ(ε)

n = min(k > rξ(ε)

n−1, η(ε)

k ∈ rX), n = 1, 2, . . . , rξ(ε)

0 = 0.

Now, let us deﬁne the random sequence,

for n = 1, 2, . . . ,

for n = 0.

34

This sequence is also a Markov renewal process with a phase space rX ×
r =

[0, ∞), the initial distribution p(ε)
0), and transition probabilities deﬁned for (i, s), (j, t) ∈ rX × [0, ∞),

i = P{η(ε)

0 = i}, i ∈ rX (remind that p(ε)

rQ(ε)

ij (t) = P{ rη(ε)

n+1 = j, rκ(ε)

n+1 ≤ t/ rη(ε)

n = i, rκ(ε)

n = s}.

(81)

Respectively, one can deﬁne the transformed semi-Markov process with

the reduced phase space rX,

rη(ε)(t) = rη(ε)

r ν(ε)(t), t ≥ 0.

where

rν(ε)(t) = max(n ≥ 0 : rζ (ε)

Indeed, let i ∈ rX. If j ∈ Y+

ir then pir(ε), prj(ε) > 0 and, again, rpij(ε) > 0. If j /∈ Y+

Thus, conditions A (a) and (b) assumed to hold for the Markov chain
n , with

η(ε)
n , imply that these conditions also hold for the Markov chain rη(ε)
sets rYi, i ∈ rX replacing sets Yi, i ∈ X.

Also, let i, j ∈ rX and i = l0, l1, . . . , lnij = j be a chain of states such
that l1 ∈ Yl0, . . . , ln ∈ Ylnij −1. As was remarked above, we can always to
assume that states l1, . . . , lnij −1 are diﬀerent and that l1, . . . , lnij−1 6= i, j.
This implies that either l1, . . . , lnij−1 6= r or there exist at most one 1 ≤ k ≤
nij − 1 such that ik = r. In the ﬁrst case, l1 ∈ rYl0, . . . , lnij ∈ rYlnij −1. In the
second case, l1 ∈ rYl0, . . . , lk−1 ∈ rYlk−2, lk−1 ∈ rYlk+1, . . . , lnij ∈ rYlnij −1.

Thus, condition A (c) assumed to hold for the Markov chain η(ε)

n , imply

that this condition also holds for the Markov chain rη(ε)

7. Sequential reduction of phase space and asymptotic expan-
sions for stationary distributions of perturbed semi-Markov pro-
cesses

In this section, we present algorithms of sequential reduction of phase
spaces for semi-Markov processes and construction of asymptotic expansions
for their stationary distributions.

7.1. Algorithms of sequential reduction of phase spaces for semi-
Markov processes. Let η(ε)(t) be a semi-Markov process with the phase
space X = {1, . . . , N}, which satisfy conditions A – F.

Let hr1, . . . , rN i is a permutation of the sequence h1, . . . , Ni, and ¯rn =
(r1, . . . , rn), n = 1, . . . , N is the corresponding sequence of growing chains of
states from space X.

Let us choose state i ∈ X, and a permutation hr1, . . . , rNi such that

rN = i.

Let us also assume that initial distribution ¯p(ε) is concentrated in the

state i, i.e., p(ε)

i = 1.

Algorithm 7. This is an algorithm for sequential reduction of the phase
space for the semi-Markov process η(ε)(t) and constructing asymptotic ex-
pansions for transition probabilities and expectation of sojourn times for
semi-Markov processes with reduced phase spaces.

7.1. Let ¯r1η(ε)(t) = r1η(ε)(t) be the reduced semi-Markov process which
is the result of reduction of state r1 for the semi-Markov process η(ε)(t). This
X = X \ {r1}, transition probabil-
semi-Markov process has the phase space ¯r1
ities of the embedded Markov chain ¯r1pi′j ′(ε), i′, j′ ∈ r1
X and expectations of
transition times ¯r1ei′j ′(ε), i′, j′ ∈ r1
X, which are determined by the transition
probabilities and the expectations of transition times for the process η(ε)(t)
via relations (87) and (96). According Theorem 1, the expectations of hitting
times Ei′j ′(ε), i′, j′ ∈ ¯r1
X coincide for the semi-Markov processes η(ε)(t) and
¯r1η(ε)(t). According Theorems 2 and 4, the semi-Markov process ¯r1η(ε)(t)
X are
satisfy conditions A – F. The transition sets ¯r1
determined for the process ¯r1η(ε)(t) by condition A and relation (90). There-
fore, the (¯r1l−

X and (¯r1m−

7.2. Let ¯r2η(ε)(t) be the reduced semi-Markov process which is the result
of reduction of state r2 for the semi-Markov process ¯r1η(ε)(t). This semi-
X = X \ {r1, r2}, the transition prob-
Markov process has the phase space ¯r2
abilities of the embedded Markov chain ¯r2pi′j ′(ε), i′, j′ ∈r1
X and the expec-

X, which are determined by
the transition probabilities and the expectations of transition times for the
process ¯r1η(ε)(t) via relations (87) and (96). According Theorem 1, the ex-
pectations of hitting times Ei′j ′(ε), i′, j′ ∈ ¯r2
X coincide for the semi-Markov
processes η(ε)(t), ¯r1η(ε)(t) and ¯r2η(ε)(t). According Theorems 2 and 4, the
transition probabilities of the embedded Markov chain ¯r2pi′j ′(ε), i′, j′ ∈ ¯r2
X
and the expectations of transition times ¯r2ei′j ′(ε), i′, j′ ∈ ¯r2
X satisfy condi-
X are determined for the process
tions A – F. The transition sets ¯r2
¯r2η(ε)(t) by condition A and relation (90) in the same way as the transition
X are determined by condition A and relation (90) for the
sets ¯r1
process ¯r1η(ε)(t). Therefore, the (¯r2l−
i′j ′)-expansions for transition prob-
abilities ¯r2pi′j ′(ε), j′ ∈ ¯r2
i′j ′)-expansions for ex-
pectations ¯r2ei′j ′(ε), j′ ∈ ¯r2
X can be constructed by applying Algo-
rithms 1, 3 and 5 to the (¯r1l−

¯r1pi′j ′(ε), j′ ∈ ¯r1

7.3. By continuing the above procedure of phase space reduction for
states r3, . . . , rN −1, we construct the semi-Markov process ¯rN −1η(ε)(t) with the
X = X \ {r1, r2, . . . , rN −1} = {i} (which is a one-point set),
phase space ¯rN −1
the transition probabilities of the embedded Markov chain ¯rN −1pii(ε) = 1,
and the expectations of transition times ¯rN −1eii(ε), which are determined by
the transition probabilities and the expectations of transition times of the
process ¯rN −2η(ε)(t) via relations (87) and (96). According Theorem 1, the
expectations of hitting times Eii(ε) for the semi-Markov processes η(ε)(t),
¯r1η(ε)(t), . . . , ¯rN −1η(ε)(t) coincide. According Theorems 2 and 4, the transi-
tion probabilities of the embedded Markov chain ¯rN −1pii(ε) = 1 and the ex-
pectations of transition times ¯rN −1eii(ε) satisfy conditions A – F.
In this
Yi = {i}, for every i ∈ X. Therefore, the
case, the transition set ¯rN −1

7.4. The semi-Markov process ¯rN −1η(ε)(t) has the one-point phase space
X = {i} and, thus, the transition probability ¯rN −1pii(ε) ≡ 1, while the
¯rN −1
expectation of transition time ¯rN −1eii(ε) = Eii(ε). The above algorithm of
sequential reduction of phase space should be repeated for every i ∈ X. In
this way, the Laurent asymptotic expansions for quantities Eii(ε), i ∈ X can
be written down. These asymptotic expansions have the following form,

Eii(ε) =

Yi′,

i′j ′)-expansions for expectations ¯rN −1ei′j ′(ε), j′ ∈ ¯rN −1

X. These expansions are pivotal.

It should be noted that, for every n = 1, . . . , N − 1, the reduced semi-
n =

Markov process ¯rnη(ε)(t) is invariant with respect to any permutation ¯r′
(r′

1, . . . , r′

n) of the the sequence ¯rn = (r1, . . . , rn).
n = (r′

1, . . . , r′

Indeed, for every such permutation ¯r′

n), the corresponding
nη(ε)(t) is constructed from the initial semi-
reduced semi-Markov process ¯r′
Markov process η(ε)(t), as the sequence of its states at sequential moment of
X =
hitting into the same reduced phase space ¯r′
X \ {r1, . . . , rn} and times between sequential jumps of the reduced semi-
nη(ε)(t) which are times between sequential hitting of the
Markov process ¯r′
above reduced space by the initial semi-Markov process η(ε)(t).

X = X \ {r′

1, . . . , r′

This implies that the expectation of transition time ¯rnei′j ′(ε) is, for every
X and n = 1, . . . , N − 1, invariant with respect to any permutation

1, . . . , r′

n) of the sequence ¯rn = (r1, . . . , rn).

i′, j′ ∈ ¯rn
¯r′
n = (r′

Moreover, as follows from the Algorithms 1 – 7, the expectation of tran-
sition time ¯rnei′j ′(ε) is a rational function of initial transition probabilities
pij(ε), j ∈ Yi, i ∈ X and expectations eij(ε), j ∈ Yi, i ∈ X (a quotient of two
sums of products of some of these probabilities and expectations), which,
according the above remarks, is invariant with respect to any permutation
¯r′
n = (r′

n) of the sequence ¯rn = (r1, . . . , rn).

By using identical arithmetical transformations (disclosure of brackets,
imposition of a common factor out of the brackets, bringing a fractional ex-
pression to a common denominator, permutation of summands or multipliers,
elimination of expression with equal absolute values and opposite signs in the
sums and elimination of equal expressions in the quotients, etc.) the rational
nei′j ′(ε) given by Algorithm 7 can be transformed in the rational
function ¯r′
function ¯rnei′j ′(ε) given by Algorithm 7 and wise versa.

By Lemma 8, these transformations do not aﬀect the corresponding asymp-
totic expansions for expectation ¯rnei′j ′(ε) given by Algorithm 7, and, thus,
these asymptotic expansions are invariant with respect to any permutation
¯r′
n = (r′

n) of the sequence ¯rn = (r1, . . . , rn).

1, . . . , r′

The above remarks can be summarized in the following theorem.
Theorem 6. Let conditions A – F hold for semi-Markov processes
η(ε)(t). Then, for every i ∈ X, the Laurent asymptotic expansion (104) for
the expectation of hitting times Eii(ε) given by Algorithm 7 can be written
down. This expansion is invariant with respect to the choice of permutation
hr1, . . . , rN −1, ii of sequence h1, . . . , Ni, in the above algorithm.

Let us now assume that conditions A, B′, C – E, F′ hold for the semi-

Markov process η(ε)(t).

Algorithm 8. This is an algorithm for computing upper bounds for

7.3. Laurent asymptotic expansions for expectations of hitting
times. Algorithms presented above yields the Laurent asymptotic expan-
sions for expectations of hitting times Eij(ε), i, j ∈ X. Indeed, let choose two
states i, j ∈ X and a chain of states ¯rN −2 = (r1, . . . , rN −2), r1, . . . , rN −2 6= i, j.
According the Theorem 1 and Algorithm 8 the expectations Eij(ε) coin-
cides for the initial semi-Markov process η(ε)(t) and the semi-Markov process
¯rN −2η(ε)(t). The semi-Markov process ¯rN −2η(ε)(t) has a two-points phase space
X = {i, j}. The expectations of hitting times Ei′j ′(ε), i′ ∈ {i, j} can be
¯rN −2
found by solving, for every j′ ∈ {i, j}, the system of (two, in this case) linear
equations (77) that yields the following formulas, for every j′ ∈ {i, j},

Ei′j ′(ε) = ¯rN −2ei′(ε) ·

¯rN −2 pi′j′ (ε),

Ej ′j ′(ε) = ¯rN −2ej ′(ε) + ¯rN −2ei′(ε) · ¯rN −2 pj′ i′ (ε)
¯rN −2 pi′j′ (ε) ,

(120)



where i′ 6= j′ in both equations in (120) and,

¯rN −2ei′(ε) = ¯rN −2ei′i(ε) + ¯rN −2ei′j(ε), i′ ∈ {i, j}.

(121)

The corresponding asymptotic expansions for Eij(ε) can be constructing
by using the asymptotic expansions for transition probabilities pj ′i′(ε) and
expectations ¯rN −2ei′(ε) given in Algorithms 7 and 8 and the operational rules
for Laurent asymptotic expansions presented in Lemmas 1 – 9.

8. Future studies and bibliographical remarks

In this section, we present some directions for future studies and short biblio-

graphical remarks concerned works in the area.

8.1. Directions for future studies. The method of sequential reduction of
a phase space presented in the paper can also be applied for getting asymptotic
expansions for high order power and exponential moments of hitting times, for
nonlinearly perturbed semi-Markov processes.

57

In the present paper, we consider the model, where the pre-limiting perturbed
semi-Markov processes have a phase space which is one class of communicative
states, while the limiting unperturbed semi-Markov process has a phase space
which consists of one or several classes of communicative states and possibly a
class of transient states. However, the method of sequential reduction of the phase
space can also be applied to nonlinearly perturbed semi-Markov processes with
absorption and, therefore, to the model, where the pre-limiting semi-Markov pro-
cesses also have a phase space, which consists of several classes of communicative
states and a class of transient states.

We are quite sure that combination of results in the above two directions
with the methods of asymptotic analysis for nonlinearly perturbed regenerative
processes developed in Silvestrov (1995, 2007, 2010) and Gyllenberg and Silve-
strov (1998, 1999a, 2000a, 2008) will make it possible to expand results concerned
asymptotic expansions for quasi-stationary distributions and other characteris-
tics for nonlinearly perturbed semi-Markov processes with absorption, where the
limiting semi-Markov process has a phase space which consists of one class of
communicative states and a class of transient states, to a general case, where the
limiting semi-Markov process has a phase space, which consists of several classes
of communicative states and a class of transient states.

The problems of aggregation of steps in the time-space screening procedures
for semi-Markov processes, tracing pivotal orders for diﬀerent groups of states as
well as getting explicit matrix formulas, for coeﬃcients and parameters of upper
bounds for remainders in the corresponding asymptotic expansions for stationary
distributions and moments of hitting times, do require additional studies. It can
be expected that such formulas can be obtained, for example, for birth-death type
semi-Markov processes, for which the proposed algorithms of reduction of a phase
space preserve the birth-death structure for reduced semi-Markov processes.

We are going to present results concerned Laurent asymptotic expansions for
power and exponential moments of hitting times, quasi-stationary distributions
and explicit formulas for coeﬃcients and parameters of upper bounds for remain-
ders for some speciﬁc classes of semi-Markov models, as well as applications to
some models of population genetics, information networks and queuing systems,
in future publications.

8.2. Bibliographical remarks. Note ﬁrst of all that the model of perturbed
discrete time Markov chains, at least, in the most diﬃcult case of so-called sin-
gularly perturbed Markov chains and semi-Markov processes with absorption and
asymptotically uncoupled phase spaces, attracted attention of researchers in the
mid of the 20th century.
