We explore in this paper the phenomenon of photofocusing: a coupling between ﬂow vorticity and
biased swimming of microalgae toward a light source that produces a focusing of the microswimmer
suspension. We combine experiments that investigate the stationary state of this phenomenon as well
as the transition regime with analytical and numerical modeling. We show that the experimentally
observed scalings on the width of the focalized region and the establishment length as a function of
the ﬂow velocity are well described by a simple theoretical model.

Microorganisms such as phytoplankton have been
shown very often to present some patchiness in their spa-
tial distribution [1, 2]. These spatial inhomogeneities oc-
cur either at large scales as in the ocean or at smaller
scales in lakes or ponds for instance. Although this patch-
iness might in some case be due to inhomogeneities of
the ecosystem – gradients in temperature or nutrients,
gravity, etc. – the coupling between ﬂow and plankton’s
ability to swim is suspected to play a major role in the
spatial localization of plankton. Indeed, patchiness has
been shown to be more important in the case of swim-
ming as compared to non-swimming plankton [3].

More generally, swimming plankton represents one
among many systems that form what is called active mat-
ter [4], i.e., systems composed of units able to self-propel
autonomously. These can be molecular motors, bacteria,
algae, ﬁsh to only mention some living systems. Active
matter attracts a lot of attention from scientists as it rep-
resents a new ”state of (non-equilibrium) matter” to be
investigated. In particular, an interesting feature to un-
derstand is how the coupling between ﬂow and motility
occurs [5, 6]. This question has been addressed for in-
stance in the case of gyrotactic algae in a ﬂow [7, 8]. Be-
cause of the eccentric location of their chloroplast, these
algae are subject to a torque induced by gravity and con-
sequently tend to swim upward. Gyrotactic algae have
been shown to concentrate in downwelling regions of tur-
bulent ﬂows [8]; this is a direct consequence of the mi-
gration of gyrotactic algae towards low vorticity regions
as shown by Kessler [7].

Here, we investigate an analogous phenomenon that
appears when ﬂow vorticity is coupled to phototaxis –
a biased swimming of algae toward a light source. We
propose a detailed quantitative description of the experi-
mental dynamics and stationary regimes of what we call
photofocusing [9] coupled to an analytical and numerical
treatment of the problem in a spirit similar to [10, 11].

A. Experimental part

The green microalga Chlamydomonas Reinhardtii is a
biﬂagellated photosynthetic cell of 10 micrometer diam-
eter [12]. Cells are grown under a 14h/10h light/dark
cycle at 22oC. Cells are harvested in the middle of the

of light source (ﬁlled symbols) and when a light is switched on
in the direction θ = π (open symbols); the cells are swimming
in a ﬂuid at rest. A truncated Lorentzian of width 1.2 is found
to adjust the experimental points.

exponential growth phase. This microalga propels itself
in a break-stroke type swimming using its two front ﬂag-
ella [13]. This way of swimming has been shown to be
well characterized by a persistent random walk [13, 14]
in absence of tropism. The typical time of persistence
is of the order of a few seconds. When subjected to a
light stimulus (green wavelength, i.e., around 510 nm),
cells tend to swim toward the light source and perform a
quasi ballistic motion.

Let us ﬁrst quantify the useful characteristics of the
phototaxism mechanism of the cells. Whereas in absence
of light bias, microalgae perform a persistent random
walk, they adopt a ballistic motion toward the direction
of a light source. Their response time is related to the
mean reorientation time in the random walk of the cells;
indeed, these reorientations allow the cells to scan the
space for the presence of a light source. This time can be
quantiﬁed by measuring the time correlation function of
direction over a whole population of cells as a function
of the time [14] and is found to be of the order of 3s.

FIG. 3. Examples of typical experiments. In absence of light
(a), microswimmers are dispersed uniformly along y direction;
in presence of light upstream (b), the cells are focalized in the
central region of the channel. Note that here only zoomed
pictured are shown for the sake of clarity but the experiments
have explored a much wider ﬁeld of view: 1.5 mm x 20 mm.

FIG. 2. Experimental setup and coordinates system.

Once microswimmers swim toward the light, trajecto-
ries still show a dispersion in their orientation. Figure 1
shows the probability distribution of angles ψ(θ − π) in
absence of light source and when a light is switched on
in the direction θ = π in a ﬂuid at rest.
The cells phototaxism is then coupled to a Poiseuille
ﬂow. A squared section channel is made of PDMS (1 ×
1× 50 mm3). A white led is used as a light source placed
upstream (ﬁg. 2). A syringe pump imposes a ﬂow with
ﬂow rates Q ranging from 0.5 to 3 mm3.s−1. Observation
is made with a macroscope (Leica APOZ16) coupled to
a CMOS camera. A low magniﬁcation objective is used
that provides a ﬁeld of view of size 1.5 mm ×20 mm; this
insures the observation of a stationary state (contrary to
our previous study [9]). The ﬂowing channel is enclosed
in an occulting box with two red ﬁltered windows for
visualization. This is to avoid any parasite light that
would trigger phototaxis.

In the stationary state,

images of the focused cells
(ﬁg. 3) are taken and analyzed to deduce the concen-
tration proﬁle along y direction. For this, Beer-Lambert
law is used to convert grey levels of intensity into con-
centration values. Volume fractions in the experiments
are below 0.4%. The cell density distribution along y di-
rection is then measured as a function of ﬂow rate and in
presence of light upstream. An example of distribution
is shown in ﬁg. 4 and compared to the analytical and nu-
merical distributions (the models are described in the fol-
lowing sections). We measure the exponential length Lx
over which a stationary density proﬁle is reached. This
length is plotted as a function of the ﬂow velocity in ﬁg. 5.
The square root d∞ of the variance of stationary experi-
mental distributions are then extracted and plotted as a
function of ﬂow mean velocity (ﬁg. 6); the experimental
results are shown to be well described by a continuum

model presented in the following.

B. Analytical modeling

1. Dynamics of individual particles

We consider a two-dimensional Poiseuille ﬂow, seeded
with point-like microswimmers which tend to reorient
their swimming direction towards the light source, sit-
uated up-stream, at randomly chosen times. We denote
as x the direction of the ﬂow, y the direction transverse to
the ﬂow, and 2L the width of the channel (−L ≤ y ≤ L).

The velocity proﬁle of the ﬂow is given by

u(y) = U0

and the strain rate is:

Each swimmer moves at a constant speed v0 in its own
swimming direction, characterized by an angle θ (ﬁg. 2)
which evolves in time due to two diﬀerent contributions.
First, due to the vorticity of the ﬂow, the swimmer ro-
tates at an angular velocity

where η is a partial drive coeﬃcient (0 < η ≤ 1) result-
ing from the fact that the microswimmers partially re-
sist against the vorticity of the ﬂow [15]. Secondly, each
swimmer reorients, at randomly chosen times, its direc-
tion of motion close to the direction of the light source
(ﬁg. 1). More precisely, a new angle θ is chosen from a
probability distribution ψ(θ − π), where ψ(θ(cid:48)) is a distri-
bution centered around θ(cid:48) = 0, and where θ = π corre-
sponds to the exact direction of the light source (ﬁg. 1).
Reorientation times occur randomly with rate α, mean-
ing that the time duration τ between two successive re-
orientations is exponentially distributed, p(τ ) = α e−ατ .

2. Statistical description

We assume that the concentration of swimmers is small
enough so that hydrodynamic interactions between swim-
mers can be neglected. The key quantity to describe the
statistics of swimmers is the probability f (r, θ, t) for a
swimmer to be at position r = (x, y), with a direction θ,
at time t. The evolution equation for f reads

∂tf +(cid:0)u(y)ex+v0e(θ)(cid:1)·∇f +
(cid:90) 2π

where ρ is the concentration of swimmers,

L2 ∂θf = −αf +αρ ψ(θ−π)

ρ(r, t) =

0

and ex is the unit vector along the x-direction (direction
of the ﬂow), while e(θ) is the unit vector in the direction
θ, with e(θ = 0) = ex. Eq. (4) contains three diﬀerent
contributions to the evolution of the probability f (r, θ, t).
The second term on the l.h.s. of Eq. (4) corresponds to
the advection of particles under the combined eﬀect of
self-propulsion and Poiseuille ﬂow. The third term on the
l.h.s. describes the rotation of the swimmers induced by
the shear ﬂow. Finally, the r.h.s. of Eq. (4) describes the
reorientation dynamics, through which the current angle

3

θ is instantaneously changed into a new angle drawn from
the distribution ψ(θ − π). It is convenient to deﬁne di-
mensionless variables by taking the channel half-width L
as the unit of length, and the inverse of the reorientation
rate α as the unit of time:

In the experiment, one has v0 ≈ 10−1mm.s−1, α ≈ 0.33
s−1, 2L = 1 mm and a shear rate of a few s−1. With
these values, one ﬁnds β ≈ 0.6 and the parameter b,
which measures the ratio between the shear rate and the
reorientation rate, is of the order of 5.

Considering the coeﬃcient b/η of the x-derivative in
Eq. (7) suggests that the density proﬁle relaxes, from the
entrance of the channel, to its x-independent shape over a
typical length scale Lx ≈ (b/η)L = U0/α. Figure 5 shows
the experimentally determined rescaled focusing length
in the x-direction and the numerical values as a function
of the rescaled ﬂow speed. Both are well described by a
linear law with a prefactor of 0.5 which is consistent with
the expected value of v0/αL = 0.6.

3. Analytical determination of the concentration proﬁle

We now wish to determine an analytical approxima-
tion of the stationary concentration proﬁle far from the
entrance of the channel, where the proﬁle becomes in-
variant along the direction of the channel. Starting from
Eq. (4), we expand the distribution f (r, θ) in angular
Fourier modes, yielding a hierarchy of coupled equations.
Using a simple closure relation, this hierarchy can be
truncated at second (nematic) order, allowing for a sim-
ple Gaussian solution of the density proﬁle given by

ρ(y) = ρmax e−y2/2σ2

where θ is, as previously, the angle between the swimmer
and the x−axis (if 0 < |θ| < π/2, the swimmer is oriented
downstream, while if π/2 < |θ| < π, the swimmer is
oriented upstream). The swimmer is constantly rotated
by the vorticity ˙γ (see Eq. 2) of the external ﬂow:

The light being situated upstream, the angle is set to π at
a frequency α, where α−1 is the persistence time which
corresponds to a ballistic motion of a cell in a ﬂuid at
rest. The parameter η corresponds to the fact that a cell
resists the ﬂow rotation as observed experimentally (i.e.
η < 1) [15]. Here, we ﬁnd η = 0.25 as a single adjustable
parameter when ﬁtting both d∞ and Lx. In our simu-
lations, we calculate the trajectories of 10 000 swimmers
0 v(t(cid:48))dt(cid:48) with diﬀerent
initial conditions: −L < y < L and x = 0. Then, we

calculate the distribution of swimmers accross the chan-
nel for diﬀerent x−values ρ(x, y) and evaluate the width
of this distribution: d(x)/L =

From d(x)/L, we evaluate the length Lx (ﬁg. 5) on which
the focusing reaches its stationnary values d∞ (ﬁg. 6).

D. Discussion and conclusion

In this paper, we show that the photofocusing experi-
mentally observed can be well described both by numer-
ical and analytical models which neglect hydrodynam-
ics interactions (a reasonable assumption for such dilute
suspensions). The experiments described in this paper
allowed us to investigate both the transition regime of
the photofocusing phenomenon as well as the stationary
distributions of cells in the channel. An analytical con-
tinuous model is shown to satisfactorily describe the ex-
perimental data and provides us with useful scaling laws.
Moreover, numerical simulations conﬁrm these ﬁndings.
Interestingly, the consistency between experimental data
and modeling backs up a hypothesis that we previously
emitted concerning the resistance of the cells to vortic-
ity and that is a key ingredient to understand the pecu-
liar rheological behaviour of Chlamydomonas Reinhardtii
suspensions [15].

We provide in this Appendix the technical aspects of
the analytical derivation of the velocity proﬁle given in
Eq. (9). Let us deﬁne, for integer k, the angular Fourier
mode as

fk(r, t) =

f (r, θ, t) eikθ dθ

(A1)

Note that f−k = f∗
k denotes the complex con-
jugate of fk, and that f0 = ρ. Expanding Eq. (4) in
Fourier modes then leads to

(note that the symmetry ψ(−θ) = ψ(θ) has been taken
into account). To shorten notations, we have introduced
in Eq. (A2) the complex diﬀerential operators

ˆ(cid:79) = ∂x + i∂y ,

ˆ(cid:79)∗ = ∂x − i∂y .

(A4)

For k = 0, Eq. (A2) reduces to the continuity equation

(cid:19)

∂tρ + U0

1 − y2
L2

∂xρ + v0Re( ˆ(cid:79)∗f1) = 0 .

(A5)

Note that v0f1 is the exact analog, using the natural
mapping between complex numbers and two-dimensional
vectors, of the usual mass ﬂux ρ¯v, where ¯v is the local
collective velocity of swimmers. Hence Eq. (A5) is equiv-
alent to a standard continuity equation of the form

5

with the mass current ρ¯v given by

ρ¯v =

U0

ρ+v0Re(f1)

ex+v0Im(f1) ey (A7)

where Re(z) is the real part of the complex number z,
and Im(z) its imaginary part.

We now search for the stationary density proﬁle ρ(y),
assumed to be invariant along the x-direction, that is
the direction of the ﬂow. Similarly, f1 depends only on
y. Under these assumptions, we ﬁnd that in the station-
ary state, f1 satisties ∂y Imf1(y) = 0. Hence Imf1(y) is
a constant, independent of y. Given that Imf1(y) is pro-
portional to the ﬂux of swimmers in the y-direction [see
Eq. (A7)], Imf1 has to be zero at the walls of the channel,
implying Imf1 = 0 for all y. The density proﬁle is thus
obtained by solving Imf1 = 0, which requires to be able
to express f1 as a function of ρ and its derivatives. This
can be done be taking into account the evolution equa-
tion of the mode f1, namely Eq. (A2) for k = 1, which
reads

(∂yρ − ∂yf2) − iηU0yf1 = −αf1 − αψ1 ρ .

(A8)

iv0

From this equation, one can express f1 as a function of
∂yρ and ∂yf2,

f1 =

1

α − iηU0y

−αψ1ρ − iv0
2

(∂yρ − ∂yf2)

.

(A9)

(cid:20)

(cid:21)

In order to close the equation, we need to express f2 as
a function of ρ and f1 (and possibly their derivatives).
Writing Eq. (A2) for k = 2, one ﬁnds

(∂yf1 − ∂yf3) − 2iηU0yf2 = −αf2 + αψ2 ρ .

(A10)

iv0
2

This equation also involves the higher order mode f3. To
obtain a simple expression for f2, we thus need to make
an approximation in order to close the set of equations.
We ﬁrst note that in the absence of ﬂow (U0 = 0) and self-
propulsion (v0 = 0), the distribution f (θ) simply relaxes
to ¯f (θ) = ρψ(θ), yielding for the Fourier modes ¯fk = ρψk.
The ﬂow and self-propulsion can then be considered as
driving mechanisms that perturb this distribution ¯f (θ).
A simple closure relation is then to neglect the eﬀect
of these perturbations on f2 (while, of course, keeping
them on f1). We thus simply assume in the following
that f2 = ρψ2. Under this approximation, the equation
Imf1 = 0 can be rewritten as, using Eq. (A9),

ηU0ψ1yρ +

(1 − ψ2)∂yρ = 0 .

After integration, we obtain for the density proﬁle
