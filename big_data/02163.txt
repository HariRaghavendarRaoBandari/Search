By means of Monte Carlo computer simulations in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble, we investigated the in-
teraction of a hydrophobic ligand with the hydrophobic surfaces of various curvatures (planar, convex and
concave). A simple two-dimensional model of water, hydrophobic ligand and surface was used. Hydration/de-
hidration phenomena concerning water molecules conned close to the molecular surface were investigated.
A notable dewetting of the hydrophobic surfaces was observed together with the reorientation of the water
molecules close to the surface. The hydrogen bonding network was formed to accommodate cavities next to
the surfaces as well as beyond the rst hydration shell. The effects were most strongly pronounced in the case
of concave surfaces having large curvature. This simplied model can be further used to evaluate the thermo-
dynamicngerprintofthedockingofhydrophobicligands.

1. Introduction
Due to the important inuence of the connement on the structural, thermodynamical, and phase
equilibrium properties of simple uids, these systems have been extensively studied recently [1–3]. The
topic is also of great interest in the studies of biological systems in which many unanswered questions
areconcernedwithhydrationanddehydrationofmoleculesofarbitraryshapeswherewaterasasolvent
ndsitselfconnedclosetothemolecularsurface.
One of the important issues that have begun to emerge is the effect of the shape, curvature, and
roughness of a surface on its interaction with a ligand [4–10]. In order to understand the phenomena
such as binding of the ligand to the receptor, or drugs to proteins, it is crucial to know the potential
of the mean force between two biomolecules in question. Virtually all the binding sites in biology have
a concave shape which imposes very particular geometrical constraints to the solvated water [11] and,
therefore,thendingsreferringtothepotentialofthemeanforcebetweentwosphericalsurfacescannot
begeneralizedtotheseproblems.
To summarize the recent molecular dynamics studies on model systems of purely hydrophobic cav-
ities [10, 12–14], it has been shown that water appears to be an active component in cavity-ligand asso-
ciation. An important impact of changes in water structure during the binding process has been noticed
[10, 14]. While the cavity hydration can be altered by changing its radius, in weakly hydrated cavity re-
gionsthereorganizationofwatermoleculesandsuppressionofthesolventuctuationsleadstoenthalpy

In this work we have focused on the investigation of the potential of the mean force between a hy-
drophobic ligand and a planar, concave, and convex purely hydrophobic surface with different curva-
tures. Our main interest was in the interpretation of the potential of the mean force through the water
microstructuralchangesduetotheconnement.Tobettervisualizetheseeffectswehavechosenasimple

The Mercedes-Benz model [16] was used to describe water molecules. In this model, the water mole-

The hydrophobic ligand was represented as a Lennard-Jones disk of the same size (σLJ = 0.7) as the
watermolecule.
To model a hydrophobic surface of a given curvature, a molecular wall was formed from Lennard-
Jones discs (see gure 1). One surface was planar, while the otherswere bent. The interaction of the test
water or hydrophobic ligand with the surfaces having positive curvatures (concave), and with negative
curvatures (convex) was tested. The two radii used for concave surfaces were R
∗ = 4.55 and 1.40, while
for the convex surfaces the radii were 2.80 and 5.95. The hydrophobic particle and the water molecules

To interpret these results in view of water microstructure, we analysed the hydration of the sur-
faces more in detail. Characteristic simulation snapshots are shown in gure 3. A dehydration of the
hydrophobic surface is noticed for all surfaces studied. The water molecules are pushed away and cavi-
tiesareformedatthesurfacecontactaswellasbeyondtherstlayerofwatermolecules.Thisisfurther
conrmed by the water-surface radial distribution functions shown in gure 4. All g (r ) show a layered
structure of water molecules away from the surface. There is no signicant qualitative difference in the
g (r ) between the planar surface case and convex bent surfaces. The value of the contact peak slightly
decreaseswithanincreasingcurvature[seepanel(a)ofgure4].
On the other hand, a qualitatively different behaviour is observed in the case of strongly concave
surface. Here, water is completely pushed away from the cavity, forming the rst hydration layer ap-
proximatelytwohydrogenbondsawayfromthesurface[gure4(b)].Thisisinagreementwiththepre-

Central particle of the surface closest to the test water was chosen to gather statistics. The angle φ is

particle [see the sketch in panel (a)]. Results for the convex shaped surfaces are shown in panel (a), and

Further, the orientation of the surface water molecules belonging to the rst hydration shell was
examined.Figure5(a)showstheresultsfortheconvexsurfaces,andpanel(b)fortheconcavesurfaces.
The case of planar wall is shown in both panels for comparison. As already noticed by Southall et al.
[20], a model water molecule close to the planar surface can no longer form all three hydrogen bonds
with neighbouring water molecules. To compensate for this loss, it “wastes” one of the hydrogen bonds
by pointing it towards the surface. This is seen from the angular distribution where the most probable
orientationofthewatermoleculeattheplanarsurfaceistheonepointingthehydrogenbondtowardsthe
surface(ϕ = 0°).Thetwohydrogenbondspointingawayfromthesurfaceparticipateintheformationof
cavitiesfacilitatingafavourableSSMinthePMFs.
As the surface adopts the convex shape, the angular preference of the water to the surface is much
less expressed. For the case in panel (a) of gure 5, we can conclude that angular preferences of water
haveanegligiblecontributiontotheshapeofthePMFs.
The situation gets reversed in the case of strongly concave surface [triangles in gure 5 (b)]. The
preferentialangleofwatermoleculeinthiscaseistheonewherethehydrogenbondingarmpointsatan
angle 60°withrespecttothecentre-centrecoordinate[seetheinsertinpanel(a)],suggestingthestrongly
obstructed hydrogen bond formation due to the lack of space in the cavity. This way a water molecule

4. Conclusions
Theresultsforthepotentialofthemeanforcebetweenhydrophobicsoluteandhydrophobicsurface
ofvariousshapesinthemodelwatersolutionswerepresented.Theresultswereanalysedinviewofhy-
dration water structure and orientation. All the hydrophobic surfaces studied showed dewetting which
was most pronounced for the bent concave surface. The angular orientation of the water molecules fa-
cilitated the formation of cavities which stabilized the non-covalent direct and water separated binding
ofthehydrophobicmoleculetothesurface.Inthefuturework,temperaturedependenceofthephenom-
ena will be investigated and the results will be used for the enthalpy-entropy decomposition of the free
energyofligand-surfaceinteraction.
