It is known that the Maximum relative Entropy (MrE) method can be used to both update and

approximate probability distributions functions in statistical inference problems. In this manuscript,

we apply the MrE method to infer magnetic properties of ferromagnetic materials.

In addition

to comparing our approach to more traditional methodologies based upon the Ising model and

Mean Field Theory, we also test the eﬀectiveness of the MrE method on conventionally unexplored

ferromagnetic materials with defects.

INTRODUCTION

In 1957, Jaynes [1, 2] showed that maximizing statistical mechanic entropy for the purpose of revealing how gas

molecules were distributed was simply the maximizing of the Shannon information entropy [3] with statistical mechan-

ical information. This idea lead to MaxEnt or his use of the Method of Maximum Entropy for assigning probabilities.

This method has recently evolved to a more general method, the method of Maximum relative Entropy (MrE) [4]

which has the advantage of not only assigning probabilities but updating them when new information is given in the

form of constraints on the family of allowed posteriors. One of the drawbacks of the MaxEnt method was the inability

to include data. When data was present, one used Bayesian methods. The methods were combined in such a way that

MaxEnt was used for assigning a prior for Bayesian methods, as Bayesian methods could not deal with information

in the form of constraints, such as expected values. Previously it has been shown that one can use the MrE method

to reproduce a mean ﬁeld solution for a simple ﬂuid [5]. The purpose of this was to illustrate that in addition to

updating probabilities, MrE can also be used for approximating probability distributions as an approximation tool.

the individual atoms are strong enough to aﬀect one and other, and give rise to the so called exchange interaction [6].

This eﬀect, however, is temperature dependent. When the temperature is below a certain point (the Curie or critical

temperature) the spins tend to all point in the same direction due to their inﬂuence on each other. This establishes

a permanent magnet as the individual atoms produce a net dipole eﬀect. Above this temperature, the atoms cease

to have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on each other and the material behaves more like a paramagnetic substance. Determining

this net dipole eﬀect can be diﬃcult. First, the interactions are due to complicated quantum eﬀects. Second, since a

given material has a very large number of atoms, computing the net dipole eﬀect can be diﬃcult in two dimensions

and completely intractable in three dimensions. Therefore, approximations such as using an Ising Model [7–9] and/or

the mean ﬁeld approximation [10–12] are made to facilitate computation.

Applications of the MrE (updating) method together with information geometric methods used to characterize

the complexity of dynamical systems described in terms of probabilistic tools are quite extensive [13–21]. In Ref.

[14, 15], using the MrE method together with diﬀerential geometric techniques, we proposed an information-geometric

characterization of chaotic energy level statistics of a quantum antiferromagnetic Ising spin chain in a tilted magnetic

ﬁeld.

In Ref.

[21], employing the very same aforementioned techniques, we were able to establish a connection

between the behavior of the information-geometric complexity of a trivariate Gaussian statistical model and the

geometric frustration phenomena that appears in triangular Ising models [22]. However, the purpose of our article

is to illustrate the use of the MrE (approximating) method as a tool for attaining approximations for ferromagnetic

materials that lie outside the ability of traditional methods. In doing so, we further the previous work done and show

the versatility of the method.

The layout of the remaining part of this manuscript is as follows. In Section II, we brieﬂy outline the essential steps

of the MrE method in updating and approximating probability distributions. In Section III, we describe the basics

of the Ising model and Mean Field Theory as approximate mathematical descriptions of ferromagnetic materials.

In Section IV, we compare magnetization properties of ferromagnets inferred by means of MrE with those obtained

via the Ising model together with Mean Field Theory. In Section V, we further test the eﬀectiveness of the MrE

methodology by considering ferromagnetic material in the presence of defects. Our ﬁnal remarks appear in Section

VI.

II. THE MAXIMUM RELATIVE ENTROPY METHOD

3

In this Section, we outline the essential elements of the MrE method as a technique for updating and/or approxi-

mating probability distributions.

A. Updating probability distributions

The MrE method is a technique for updating probabilities when new information is provided in the form of a

constraint on the family of the allowed posteriors. The main feature of the MrE method is the possibility of updating

probabilities in the presence of both data and expected value constraints. This feature was ﬁrst formally presented in

[4] where, in particular, it was shown that Bayes updating can be regarded as a special case of the MrE method. A

ﬁrst semi-quantitative analysis of the eﬀective advantages of this powerful feature of the MrE method appeared in [23].

Finally, the ﬁrst fully quantitative investigation of the advantages of the MrE method was carried out in [24] where

two toy problems were solved in detail. Following these lines of investigation, we present here a novel application of

the MrE method to a real-world ferromagnetic problem.

We use the MrE method to update from a prior to a posterior probability distribution. Speciﬁcally, we want to

make inferences on some quantity θ ∈ Θ given:

i) the prior information about θ (the prior);

ii) the known relationship between D ∈ D and θ ∈ Θ (the model);

iii) the observed values of the variables (data) D ∈ D.

The search space for the posterior probability distribution occurs in the product space D×Θ, and the joint distri-

bution is denoted as P (D, θ). The key idea is going from the old prior Pold (θ) to the updated prior Pnew (θ),

Pnew (θ) def=

dDPnew (D, θ) .

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

The joint probability Pnew (D, θ) maximizes the relative entropy functional S [P |Pold ],

S [P |Pold ] def= −

subject to the given information constraints. Note that Pold (D, θ),

Pold (D, θ) = Pold (D |θ ) Pold (θ) ,

(1)

(2)

(3)

4
is called here the joint prior, while Pold (θ) and Pold (D |θ ) denote the standard Bayesian prior and the likelihood,

respectively. We emphasize that both the joint prior and the standard Bayesian prior encode prior information about
θ ∈ Θ. Furthermore, despite the fact that the likelihood is not regarded as prior information in the conventional
sense, it will be considered here as prior information since it represents the a priori established relation between θ ∈ Θ
and D ∈ D. Let us specify now the relevant information constraints. First, we impose the standard normalization

constraint,

(cid:90)

dDdθP (D, θ) = 1.

Second, we consider an information constraint in the form of expected value of some smooth function g (θ),

(cid:90)

dDdθg (θ) P (D, θ) def= (cid:104)g (θ)(cid:105) ≡ G.

Finally, we consider the observed data D(cid:48). Within the MrE method, knowledge of this information leads to an inﬁnite

number of constraints,

(cid:90)

dθP (D, θ) ≡ P (D) = δ (D − D(cid:48)) ,

(6)

for any D ∈ D where δ denotes the Dirac delta function. Using the Lagrange multipliers technique, we maximize the

logarithmic relative entropy functional in Eq. (2) subject to the constraints in Eqs. (4), (5), and (6). We impose that
the variation with respect to P of the entropy functional S [P |Pold ] is equal to zero,

 = 0.

(4)

(5)

(7)

(8)

(9)

We note that Eq. (6) describes the information in the data and represents an inﬁnite number of constraints on the

family P (D, θ). For this reason, there exist one constraint and one Lagrange multiplier γ (D) for each value of D.

After some simple algebra of variations, Eq. (7) becomes

(cid:90)

dDdθ [− log P (D, θ) − 1 + log Pold (D, θ) + α + βg (θ) + γ (D)] δP (D, θ) = 0,

for any δP (D, θ). Therefore, from Eq. (8) we ﬁnd

Pnew (D, θ) = Pold (D, θ) e−1+α+βg(θ)+γ(D),

where the Lagrange multipliers α, β, and γ (D) can be formally determined by substituting Eq. (9) into Eqs. (4), (5)

and (6), respectively. After some algebra, we obtain

Pnew (D, θ) =

.

(10)

(cid:82) dθeβg(θ)Pold (D, θ)

5

Observe that the Lagrange multiplier β in Eq. (10) can only be implicitly determined and depends on the observed
data D(cid:48). Finally, marginalizing Pnew (D, θ) over the variable D, we obtain the updated prior probability distribution

(cid:90)

Finally, Eq. (11) becomes

eβg(θ)
ξ (D(cid:48), β)

.

.

(11)

(12)

(13)

Note that in the absence of constraints in the form of expected values, β = 0 and Eq. (13) reduces to the standard

Bayes updating relation

Pnew (θ) =

Pold (θ) Pold (D(cid:48) |θ )

Pold (D(cid:48))

.

For the sake of completeness, we point out that Eq. (14) can be obtained by combining Bayes theorem,

and Bayes rule,

Pold (θ |D ) =

Pold (θ) Pold (D |θ )

Pold (D)

,

Pnew (θ) = Pold (θ |D(cid:48) ) .

In what follows, we shall regard the MrE method as a tool for approximating probability distributions.

(14)

(15)

(16)

B. Approximating probability distributions

For the sake of reasoning, assume that the microstates of a system are labeled by coordinates x. Furthermore,

assume that the probability that the system is in a microstate within a given range dx is described by the canonical

distribution [25],

where the function Z is deﬁned as,

P (x) dx =

e−βH(x)

Z

dx,

(cid:90)

Z =

dxe−βH(x) def= e−βF .

(17)

(18)

6

In statistical mechanical terms, the quantity F in Eq. (18) denotes the Helmholtz free energy. In general, to describe

a system in terms of its observables, one needs to compute expected values in terms of integrals over P which, in
turn, depends on the Hamiltonian H (x). Calculating these integrals can be quite challenging especially when the

Hamiltonian exhibits nonlinear interaction terms. To make things more tractable, one can think of replacing the

exact expression of P with an approximate expression P0 provided that the latter preserves the relevant information

content essential for our speciﬁc inferences. More speciﬁcally, P0 can be identiﬁed in two steps. First, identify a
suitable family of trial distributions FPA = {PA} relevant for our speciﬁc problem at hand. Second, select P0 from
FPA. There is no recipe for the ﬁrst step. The second step is mechanical. The distribution to be selected is the one

that maximizes the entropy of PA relative to P ,

S [PA |P ] = −

(cid:90)

dxPA (x) log

(cid:20) PA (x)

(cid:21)

P (x)

.

(19)

A very convenient family of trial distributions is given by the canonical distributions with a modiﬁed Hamiltonian
H0 (x; ξ) where ξ are parameters that label each distribution within a family,

where the Z0 function is given by,

P0 (x; ξ) dx =

e−βH0(x; ξ)

Z0

dx,

(cid:90)

dxe−βH0(x; ξ).

Z0

def= e−βF0(ξ) =

(20)

(21)

We underline that in Sec. II, the symbol θ is used to denote one parameter or many parameters about which one

wishes to make inferences. Here, as mentioned earlier, the parameters ξ are used to label a family of trial distributions
that are canonical with the Hamiltonian H0 (x; ξ). Substituting Eqs. (17), (18), (20), and (21) into Eq. (19), we get

where,

S [P0 |P ] = β (F − F0) + β (cid:104)H0 − H(cid:105)0 ,

(cid:90)

(cid:104)H0 − H(cid:105)0

def=

dxP0 (x; ξ) (H0 − H) .

(22)

(23)

Note that the symbol (cid:104)·(cid:105)0 in Eq. (22) denotes the average over the trial distribution P0 (x; ξ) and the subscript 0 is
simply used to recall that P0 (x; ξ) is canonical with the modiﬁed Hamiltonian H0 (x; ξ). Since S [P0 |P ] ≤ 0, Eq.

(22) implies

F ≤ F0 + (cid:104)H0 − H(cid:105)0 .

(24)

7
Loosely speaking, maximizing S is equivalent to minimizing F0 + (cid:104)H0 − H(cid:105)0. This latter minimization procedure is

also known as the Bogoliubov Variational Principle [26] which, as shown here, can be regarded as a special case of

the MrE method.

III. FERROMAGNETIC MATERIALS

One of the most interesting phenomena in solid state physics is represented by ferromagnetism [10–12]. In spite

of the extensive oversimpliﬁcations required to construct a tractable mathematical model describing such a phenom-

ena, calculations concerning ferromagnetism are among the most impressive exhibition of brute force computation

achieved by theoretical physicists [27, 28]. In what follows, we shall outline the basics of the so-called Ising model of

ferromagnetic materials [29]. A few ferromagnetic materials together with their corresponding critical temperatures

are listed in Table I.

A. The Ising Model

One of the simplest systems that exhibits a transition from ordered to disordered states is that of a lattice composed

of two diﬀerent types of objects, A and B. Assume that the objects interact with only their nearest neighbors. If

one raises the temperature T of the system at some critical point Tc, the system will melt and become completely

disordered. A relatively simple mathematical model of such a system was developed by Ernst Ising to describe

ferromagnetism [29]. The general expression for the Ising Hamiltonian is given by [10],

H {si} def= −(cid:88)

(cid:104)ij(cid:105)

N(cid:88)

i=1

Jijsisj − B

si,

(25)

8
where si ∈ {+1, − 1} is the spin variable, N is the cardinality of the spin variables, {si} determines the spin
conﬁguration of the whole system, the symbol (cid:104)ij(cid:105) with (cid:104)ij(cid:105) = (cid:104)ji(cid:105) denotes a pair of next neighbor spins, Jij are

the exchange coupling constants, and B is the z-component of a uniform external magnetic ﬁeld. Ferromagnetic and

antiferromagnetic materials are characterized by exchange coupling coeﬃcients with Jij > 0 and Jij < 0, respectively,

for all pairs i, j. For instance, iron (Fe) and iron oxide (FeO) are examples of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic

materials, respectively. Their critical temperature is given by T (F e)

c

= 1043K and T (F eO)

c

= 198K [11], respectively.

For the sake of reasoning, we shall assume in what follows that B = 0 (zero external magnetic ﬁeld) and Jij = J > 0

for all pairs i, j (isotropic interaction strength). The Hamiltonian in Eq. (25) becomes,

H {si} def= −J

sisj.

(26)

(cid:88)

(cid:104)ij(cid:105)

The sum over (cid:104)ij(cid:105) in Eq. (26) contains γN/2 terms where γ is the number of next nearest neighbors of each lattice

site and depends on the speciﬁc type of lattice structure being considered. For instance, for a two-dimensional square
lattice, γ = 4. The partition function Z (T ) corresponding to the Hamiltonian in Eq. (26) is the sum of 2N terms

and is given by [10],

(27)

where β = β (kB, T ) def= (kBT )

−1, with kB ≈ 1.38 × 10−23JK−1 denoting the Boltzmann constant. As a side remark,

we recall that the thermodynamic functions (internal energy and thermal capacity, for instance) can be obtained in

the usual manner from the Helmholtz free energy F (T ) [10],

F (T ) def= −kBT log Z (T ) .

(28)

In the two-dimensional case with only nearest neighbor interactions and simple lattice conﬁgurations (square and

triangular, for instance), the exact free energy is known in the hypothesis of zero magnetic ﬁeld [27, 28]. For the one
dimensional case, the partition function Z (T ) can easily be calculated,

Z (T ) = 2N [cosh (βJ)]N−1 N(cid:29)1≈ [2 cosh (βJ)]N .

Furthermore, the resulting average energy ¯H for N (cid:29) 1 would then be,

¯H = − ∂ log Z
∂β

= −N J tanh (βJ) ,

(29)

(30)

where tanh (·) denotes the hyperbolic tangent function. For the sake of clarity, a rectangular two-dimensional Ising

model is depicted in FIG. 1.

9

FIG. 1: Schematic illustration of a rectangular two-dimensional Ising model.

B. The mean ﬁeld approximation

One of the most important starting points for more sophisticated calculations concerning ferromagnetic transitions

is furnished by the so-called mean ﬁeld theory (or, molecular ﬁeld theory [30]). The mean ﬁeld approximation for the

Ising model assumes that each and every spin is subject to a mean ﬁeld generated by its next nearest neighbors only

[10]. Such an approximation turns out to be especially important for three dimensional materials where each atom

may have 6, 8 or even 12 close neighbors depending on the crystal geometry [6, 12].

We start with the same energy function as given in Eq. (26) but now examine only one atom (sometimes called the

central atom),

Hi = −Jsi

n(cid:88)

j=1

sj ,

(31)

where Hi is the energy ascribed to one atom and n is the number of nearest neighbors (for instance, a face-centered

cubic lattice would have n = 12) with atoms at the edge of the material neglected. Assuming that each neighbor

contributes equally and averaging over the neighbor spins around this one atom, we obtain

where,

¯Hi = −Jsin¯sj,

n(cid:88)

j=1

with j ∈ {1,..., n}. The Boltzmann probability pi of ﬁnding this atom in the si state is given by,

FIG. 2: Contour plot exhibiting the numerical solution of the mean magnetization M vs. temperature T in case of the mean

with c ∈ {−0.8, − 0.6,..., 0, 0.2,..., 0.6} .

and the partition function Zi becomes,

Zi = 2 cosh (βJn¯sj) .

(35)

Taking the average of si for this one atom over its two possible states, using Eqs. (34) and (35), the mean magnetization

becomes

(36)

Furthermore, assuming that all atoms will behave like this one labeled with the i index and assuming that the average

spin ¯s for the entire ferromagnetic material is formally deﬁned as,

from Eqs. (36) and (37), we ﬁnd

¯s def= (cid:104)(cid:104)si(cid:105)(cid:105) = (cid:104)¯sj(cid:105) ,

¯s = tanh (βJn¯s) .

(37)

(38)

Observe that the inner and outer expectation values in the nested expectation value in Eq. (37) used to deﬁne the

average spin ¯s for the entire ferromagnetic material represent the averages over all possible states of an atom and over

0246810(cid:45)1.0(cid:45)0.50.00.51.0temperature,Tmeanmagnetization,Mall atoms of the material, respectively. If one considers Eq. (25) instead of Eq. (26), Eq. (38) can be generalized and

becomes [31],

11

¯s = tanh [β (nJ ¯s + B)] ,

(39)

where B denotes the intensity of the applied external magnetic ﬁeld. Eq. (39) can be solved numerically in order

to uncover the mean magnetization M def= ¯s as a function of the temperature T of the system. A contour plot of

where µ def= 
we also point out that if one were to write the full Hamiltonian with the external ﬁeld instead of H {si} as given in
Eq. (26), then one will not have as simple of a solution for Z as in Eq. (29), i.e. Zeﬀ (cid:54)= [2 cosh (β)]N .

IV. MAXIMUM RELATIVE ENTROPY METHOD AND FERROMAGNETIC MATERIALS

As we have seen in the previous Section, the Ising model and mean ﬁeld theory require various assumptions to be

fulﬁlled. Part of the strength of using the MrE is that one does not need to justify some of the assumptions. Stated

otherwise, one simply supplies the information constraints that one has available and then allow the method to turn

out the least biased solution based on the information given. This can be demonstrated by using the MrE method to

ﬁnd an appropriate approximate description of a ferromagnetic material.

Following the procedure outlined in Section II, we begin by determining the full posterior solution for a ferromagnetic

atomic system where we have both an expectation value constraint as well as observed data. For this example, the

data observed will be the eﬀect of the external magnetic ﬁeld, Bi on each atom. The appropriate entropy to consider

becomes,

S[p|pold] = −

(cid:90)

(cid:88)

{s}

dN B

(cid:21)

(cid:20) p{s, B}

pold {s, B}

p{s, B} log

(42)

12
where p{s, B} = p(s1, B1,. . . , sN , BN ), pold {s, B} will be a ﬂat prior (constant in s and uniform in B), N denotes

the number of atoms, and

(cid:90)

Second, we consider the energy constraint in the form of the expectation value of the Hamiltonian,

(cid:90)

(cid:88)

{s}

dN B

H {s} p{s, B} ≡ (cid:104)H {s}(cid:105) ,

(43)

(44)

where H {s} denotes some general Hamiltonian. For illustrative purposes, we adopt as our starting point the Ising

model so as to show how one can use the MrE to arrive at a similar approximation as the one produced by mean ﬁeld
theory. Let H {s} in Eq. (44) be deﬁned as,

H {s} def= Hint + Hext = −J

µBisi.

(45)

(cid:88)

(cid:104)ij(cid:105)

sisj − N(cid:88)

i=1

where Hint equals H in Eq.

(26) and Hext is the energy attributed to the observed external magnetic ﬁeld Bi

acting on the individual atoms. Next is to apply the data constraints. As mentioned in Section II, there are an

inﬁnite number of data constraints associated with a single data point. Therefore, here we have N sets of them, one

set for each data point. For illustrative purposes, we will assume that the ﬁeld is uniform and therefore the value
Bi = Bj = B for all i, j ∈ {1,..., N}. We can then simply write the data constraint as,

dB

p{s, B} ≡ p{B} = δ (B − B(cid:48)) .

(46)

(cid:90)

(cid:88)

{s}

Along with the normalization constraint, maximizing the logarithmic relative entropy with respect to the constraints

yields the canonical distribution,

p{s} =

1

Z(cid:48) e−βH(cid:48){s},

(47)

where p{s} = p(s1. . . sN ), Z(cid:48) is similar to the partition function from Eq. (27) with the exception of the data in the
Hamiltonian H(cid:48) {s} which is now,

H(cid:48) {s} def= Hint + H(cid:48)

ext = −J

µB(cid:48)si.

However, in order to determine the values of quantities such as the critical temperature, the total magnetic moment

and the magnetic susceptibility, we are faced with the same dilemma as above: we cannot compute the solutions

explicitly. Therefore, we must try to ﬁnd an approximation that is computationally tractable. We now wish to use

MrE to ﬁnd an approximation that is tractable. We accomplish this by ﬁrst writing down the appropriate entropy
functional S[pA|p],

,

(49)

where p is the canonical probability distribution as in Eq.
approximation that we seek. We proceed by rewriting the entropy functional S[pA|p] as,

(47) with H(cid:48) {s} as given in Eq.

S[pA|p] = −(cid:88)

{s}

pA log pA +

pA log p.

Using Eqs. (47) and (48), Eq. (50) becomes

When using the MrE method, we maximize the entropy functional in order to ﬁnd the best posterior given the

information provided. For this speciﬁc case, we have rewritten the entropy in terms of an inequality that compares

the free energy of the system F with the approximate values for the average energy EA and the entropy SA. The

free energy is minimized to determine the best approximation for pA. This minimization problem is also known as

the Bogoliubov Variational Principle [5]. Therefore, from our discussion, we conclude that this Variational Principle

is simply a special case of the MrE method. To be more general, we proceed with using the MrE method to ﬁnd

the best approximation. As stated earlier, when using the MrE method, the goal is to search the family of possible

posteriors in order to ﬁnd the one that maximizes the entropy given the constraints. In addition to this, we need a

solution that is tractable. Therefore, we seek a posterior pA that has a form

pA =

constant, the solution is independent of the index i. Next we maximize S[pA|p] in Eq. (49) or, in keeping with the

The critical temperature Tc is the temperature at which spontaneous magnetization in a lattice of magnetic material

begins to appear, and this is where a phase transition occurs [32]. Roughly speaking, a phase transition in a lattice is

a singularity in the limit of log Z(T )

D

as D, the size of the lattice, approaches inﬁnity. For the sake of completeness, we

remark here that while Onsager was the ﬁrst to obtain a closed-form solution to the Ising two-dimensional ferromag-

netic model in the absence of an external magnetic ﬁeld [27], Yang was the ﬁrst to publish the exact calculation of

the spontaneous magnetization for a two-dimensional Ising model [28]. Returning to FIG. 2, we note that for T > Tc,

there is only one approximating probability distribution that is uniform over all states. For T < Tc, there are two

minima that correspond to approximating distributions that are symmetry-broken, with all spins more likely to be
down, or all spins more likely to be up. Furthermore, notice that if B(cid:48) = 0 in Eq. (72), we recover our solution using

the mean ﬁeld approximation above. As a matter of fact, letting A = Jn¯s, we rewrite Eq. (72) as,

that is, we reattain Eq. (38),

Jn¯s = Jn tanh (βJn¯s) ,

¯s = tanh (βJn¯s) .

(74)

(75)

However, from Eq. (72) alone we can formally solve for the critical temperature, the total magnetic moment and the

magnetic susceptibility (that is, the ratio between the magnetization of the material and the strength of the magnetic

ﬁeld applied to the material) in the usual way [33]. This is true even though we still do not know the explicit form

for A. Using this MrE approach, we did not need to assume that all atoms behave like a central atom and we did

not need to know the explicit form of the eﬀective energy A, only that there was one. Following the MrE method

we simply processed all of the information that we had available. Notice that we also no longer need to assume Ising

conditions. We further explore such considerations in the next Section.

V. EXAMPLE TOY APPLICATIONS

In this Section, we employ MrE techniques to infer the numerical estimates of eﬀective energy levels of atoms in

two cases: i) atoms with three possible states; ii) defective atoms in a crystal lattice.

A. Atoms with three possible states

17

To illustrate the use of MrE in determining critical temperatures, we look at the Ising model with three possible
states: spin up, spin down, and no spin. In this example, we will let s ∈ {+1, 0,−1} where an atom in the 0-state

would contribute no energy. We follow the same line of reasoning outlined in the previous Section up until Eq. (57)
where the new expected value for the i-th spin variable (cid:104)si(cid:105)A is now given by,

(cid:104)si(cid:105)A

def=

as a function of A and T appears in FIG. 3. As stated earlier, this equation can then be used as above to solve for

FIG. 3: Contour plot exhibiting the numerical solution of the eﬀective energy A vs. temperature T . We set kB = 1 and assume

seems to support the idea that the introduction of additional (allowed) states in the atomic ferromagnetic structure is

consistent with both space shifts and nonhomogeneities of the critical temperature [34, 35]. A deeper understanding

of these speciﬁc aspects require a deeper analysis that we leave to future investigations.

As a side remark, although unnecessary and perhaps impractical, it should be noted that the spin state 0 could be

introduced as an observable quantity in a way that is analogous to how B in Eq. (46) was implemented.

B. Defects in a crystal lattice

In [36], Onsager’s method was used to study the physical properties of a two-dimensional square lattice containing

four kinds of atoms under the assumption that only the interaction of nearest neighbors was important and that only

two distinct energies of interaction were permitted. Here, following this line of investigation, we examine the case

where one of the atoms is actually a missing one. In real cases, it would be very diﬃcult to know how many atoms

there are of each type. Indeed, the point of the central atom idea is that we cannot know the states of all the atoms

in a lattice, so we must assume they are all the same. However, it can be that when a crystal is scanned, the scan can

indicate where there might be impurities or defects. In solid state physics, a point defect (or, vacancy) in a monatomic

Bravais lattice occurs whenever a lattice site that would usually be occupied by an ion in the perfect crystal has not

any ion associated with it. For the sake of clarity, a vacancy is illustrated in FIG. 4. In the previous application, we

examined a three state atom. In this next example, we shall examine a material that has a known defect or defects. In

this case, we need to use two eﬀective energy terms. One for the atoms that are surrounded by non-defective atoms,

ND and another for the ones aﬀected by the defect, D. For illustrative purposes, we will examine the case where
we only have one defective atom. This means that there are N − n − 1 atoms that are surrounded by non-defective

atoms, n atoms that have one defective atom next to it and 1 atom which is the defective atom. For our purposes, let
us think of the defect as an empty slot. Given these conditions, the actual Hamiltonian H {s} of the system is given

by,

where i labels the non-defective atoms, j labels the neighbors (n) for these atoms, k are the atoms aﬀected by the

looking at this defect as an empty slot, we let s0 = 0. Now we write our estimated Hamiltonian HA for this case as,

as a function of D and T appears in FIG. 5. These equations can then be used as above to solve for the critical

temperature, the total magnetic moment and the magnetic susceptibility for this ferromagnetic material as usual.

The diﬀerence here is that we will have two of each. For example, a critical temperature that applies to most of the

atoms, and one that is local to the defect. Therefore, the total magnetic moment will not simply be a result of just one

temperature but a combination of each magnetic moment determined by these equations. Notice that Eq. (81) still

holds in general. In the two energy case, we have for one energy the number of nearest neighbors, nG = n and for the
second energy, nG = n − 1. As a ﬁnal consideration, we point out that the outcomes of our entropic analysis in Eqs.

(96) and (97) together with the numerical representation in FIG. 5 are consistent with the fact that imperfections

in the lattice structure can be the cause of structural irregularities in the critical temperature Tc [34, 35]. However,

to obtain a deeper understanding of these aspects of ferromagnetic materials from an entropic viewpoint, a more

thorough analysis would be required.

Just as in the previous example, the defect could be introduced here as an observable by means of a constraint like

is a Kronecker delta function. This makes much more sense here as this information may be obtained by

common spectroscopic methods such as electron paramagnetic resonance, photoluminescence or cathodoluminescence.
In the particular case considered here, we observed s(cid:48)

VI. CONCLUSIVE REMARKS

In this article, we showed that not only can the MrE method be used for updating probability distributions with

both data and expectation values, but for determining eﬀective approximations of such probability distributions

equivalent to those provided by the Bogoliubov Variational Principle and/or Mean Field Theory. Speciﬁcally, after

describing the traditional Ising model of a ferromagnetic material and the mean ﬁeld approximation for a multidimen-

sional ferromagnet, we applied the MrE method to infer both magnetization and energetic features of ferromagnets

characterized by simple lattice conﬁgurations. Our main results can be summarized as follows:

1. The standard mean ﬁeld theory solution was recovered via MrE methods for the ferromagnetic Ising model.

These ﬁndings are reported in Eq. (39) and FIG. 2. The main advantage of our analysis is the fact that we

do not require the knowledge of the exact form of the eﬀective energy A and we allow for departures from the

centrality of the atom.

2. Moving past traditional methods and assumptions by using MrE, we examined ferromagnets characterized by

three state atoms. The outcomes of our entropic analysis are reported in Eq. (79) and FIG. 3. Based on these

results, we concluded that our analysis appears to support the idea that the introduction of additional states

in the atomic ferromagnetic structure is consistent with both space shifts and nonhomogeneities of the critical

temperature Tc [34, 35].

24

3. A ferromagnetic material was considered that had known defects, which is beyond the scope of the mean

ﬁeld methodology. These ﬁndings are presented in Eqs. (96), (97) and FIG. 5.

In each case we uncovered

results independent of the explicit form of the eﬀective energy in the Hamiltonian. Relying on these results, we

concluded that our research appears to be consistent with the fact that imperfections in the lattice structure

can be the cause of structural irregularities in the critical temperature Tc [34, 35].

4. Although it may seem trivial to introduce the observational data through an MrE constraint, as opposed to

simply putting it in as would be conventionally done, it should be noted that these toy examples are mostly

for pedagogical purposes in order to demonstrate how the mechanism works. The power of this methodology

enters when one does not know the expectation value of the Hamiltonian, but may know how it relates to some

observable, as done in [24]. For instance, a more interesting example might be a case in which the joint prior
equals pold {s, B} = pold {s} pold{B | s} where pold{B | s} is the Bayesian likelihood that represents a model
that relates some observable Bi with si, like pold{B | s} ∝ e−βHext with Hext described in Eq. (45). Care must

be taken when examining this scenario and such considerations will be explored in later works.

A function f = f (x) can fail to be diﬀerentiable at a point x = x0 in three scenarios: it has a vertical tangent line at

x = x0, it has a discontinuity at x = x0, it exhibits a kink (or, corner) at x = x0. Interestingly, we point out that Figs.

2, 3, and 5 show a vertical tangent, a jump discontinuity, and a kink, respectively. Speciﬁcally, the arbitrary function

f is represented by the mean magnetization of the ferromagnetic material in FIG. 2, by the eﬀective energy of an atom

in FIG. 3, and ﬁnally, by the eﬀective energy of a defective atom in FIG. 5. Although numerical methods are often

ineﬀective near points of discontinuity, our qualitative entropic analysis seems to suggest that departures from the

standard Ising model (with a vertical tangent type of singularity) can lead to alternative types of non-diﬀerentiable

singularities.

While the ﬁndings uncovered in this manuscript are not conclusive (about the nature of phase transitions in the

presence of imperfections) by any means, this work seems to suggest that using the MrE method can be useful in

inferring both thermal and electromagnetic properties of defective ferromagnetic materials in presence of available

data from the substance being considered. Of course, a more detailed investigation would be required to deepen our

understanding of these important phenomena in fundamental and applied science. Indeed, it is our intention to extend

our study to higher order spin conﬁgurations [37] (for example, XY spin chains, XX spin chains, Heisenberg models,

or, more generally, Potts models [38, 39]). Finally, we point out that MrE methods employed in this article can be

readily applied, in principle, to the investigation of more general dislocation, disclination, and dispiration defects in

solid state physics [40]. In particular, it would be very interesting to infer physical properties of materials exhibiting

a non-uniform distribution of defects of diﬀerent types. We leave these investigations to future eﬀorts.
