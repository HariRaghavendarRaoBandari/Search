ALGORITHMIC RANDOMNESS AND FOURIER ANALYSIS

JOHANNA N.Y. FRANKLIN, TIMOTHY H. MCNICHOLL, AND JASON RUTE

Abstract. Suppose 1 < p < ∞. Carleson’s Theorem states that the Fourier
series of any function in Lp[−π, π] converges almost everywhere. We show
that the Schnorr random points are precisely those that satisfy this theorem
for every f ∈ Lp[−π, π] given natural computability conditions on f and p.

1. Introduction

Recent discoveries have shown that algorithmic randomness has a very natural
connection with classical analysis. Many theorems in analysis have the form “For
almost every x, . . .”; the set of points for which the central claim of the theorem
fails for a given choice of parameters is called an exceptional set of the theorem. For
example, one of Lebesgue’s diﬀerentiation theorems states that if f is a monotone
function on [0, 1], then f is diﬀerentiable almost everywhere. In this case, for each
monotone function f on [0, 1], the set of points at which f is not diﬀerentiable
is an exceptional set. On the other hand, every natural randomness notion is
characterized by a conull class of points. This suggests it is possible to characterize
the points that satisfy a particular theorem in analysis in terms of a randomness
notion. Put another way, it may be the case that exceptional sets of a theorem can
be used to characterize a standard notion of randomness.

To date, results of this nature have been discovered in ergodic theory [4, 19, 20,
22, 26, 36, 50], diﬀerentiability [5, 6, 21, 27, 36, 40, 43], Brownian motion [1, 2, 18],
and other topics in analysis [3, 9, 45]. In this paper, we add Fourier series to this
list by considering Carleson’s Theorem. The original version of this theorem was
proven in 1966 by L. Carleson for L2 functions [10]; we will consider an extension
of this theorem to Lp functions for p > 1 that is due to Hunt but still generally
referred to as Carleson’s Theorem [28]. Throughout this paper we only consider
the complex version of Lp[−π, π]; that is, we work in the space of all measurable

f : [−π, π] → C so thatR π

−π |f (t)|p dt < ∞.

Carleson’s Theorem. Suppose 1 < p < ∞. If f is a function in Lp[−π, π], then
the Fourier series of f converges to f almost everywhere.

Suppose 1 < p < ∞. It is well known that the Fourier series of any f ∈ Lp[−π, π]
converges to f in the Lp-norm. It follows that if the Fourier series of f ∈ Lp[−π, π]
converges almost everywhere, then it converges to f almost everywhere.

We consider Carleson’s Theorem in the context of computable analysis and
demonstrate the points that satisfy this theorem are precisely the Schnorr random
points via the following two theorems.

Theorem 1.1. Suppose p > 1 is a computable real. If t0 ∈ [−π, π] is Schnorr
random and f is a computable vector in Lp[−π, π], then the Fourier series for f
converges at t0.

FRANKLIN, MCNICHOLL, AND RUTE

Theorem 1.2. If t0 ∈ [−π, π] is not Schnorr random, then there is a computable
function f : [−π, π] → C whose Fourier series diverges at t0.

It is well known that when p ≥ 1 is a computable real, there are incomputable
functions in Lp[−π, π] that are nevertheless computable as vectors, e.g., step func-
tions. Thus, Theorem 1.2 is considerably stronger than the converse of Theorem
1.1. To the best of our knowledge, Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 yield the ﬁrst characteri-
zation of a randomness notion via a theorem of Fourier analysis. The proofs reveal
some interesting and sometimes surprising connections between topics from algo-
rithmic randomness such as Schnorr integral tests and topics from classical analysis
such as analytic and harmonic function theory.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the necessary back-
ground. Sections 3 and 4 contain the proofs of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2, respectively.
In Sections 5 and 6 we give two variations of Theorem 1.1. The ﬁrst variation char-
acterizes the values to which the Fourier series converges. The second variation
addresses the Fej´er-Lebesgue Theorem which is similar to Carleson’s Theorem, but
also applies to the L1 case. Section 7 contains a broader analysis of our results.

2. Background and preliminaries

We begin with the necessary topics from analysis and then discuss computable
analysis and algorithmic randomness. We assume the reader is familiar with clas-
sical computability in discrete settings as expounded in [12, 41, 42, 46].

2.1. Fourier analysis. We begin with some notation. For all n ∈ Z and t ∈
[−π, π], let en(t) = eint. For all n ∈ Z and f ∈ L1[−π, π], let

For all f ∈ L1[−π, π] and all N ∈ N, let

cn(f ) =

SN (f ) =

cn(f )en.

That is, SN (f ) is the (N + 1)st partial sum of the Fourier series of f . We say that
f ∈ L1[−π, π] is analytic if cn(f ) = 0 whenever n < 0.

C. Feﬀerman showed that when 1 < p < ∞, there is a constant C so that

k sup
N

|SN (f )|k1 ≤ Ckf kp

for all f ∈ Lp[−π, π] [15, 16]. We can (and do) assume that C is a positive integer.
The operator f 7→ supN |SN (f )| is known as the Carleson operator.

Let E = {en : n ∈ Z}. A trigonometric polynomial is a function in the linear
span of E. If p is a trigonometric polynomial, then the degree of p is the smallest
d ∈ N so that Sd(p) = p.

2.2. Complex analysis. We now summarize the required information on analytic
and harmonic functions, in particular harmonic measure. This material will be used
exclusively in Section 4 (the proof of Theorem 1.2). More expansive treatments of
analytic and harmonic functions can be found in [11] and [38]; the material on
harmonic functions is drawn from [24].

Suppose U ⊆ C is open and connected. Recall that a function f : U → C is
analytic if it has a power series expansion at each point of U ; equivalently, if f is
diﬀerentiable at each z0 ∈ U in the sense that

lim
z→z0

f (z) − f (z0)

z − z0

exists.

Let D denote the unit disk, and let λ denote Lebesgue measure on the unit circle.
The points on the unit circle are called the unimodular points. When f is analytic
on D, let

an(f ) =

f (n)(0)

n!

for all n ∈ N. That is, an(f ) is the (n + 1)st coeﬃcient of the MacLaurin series of
f . Thus,

for all z ∈ D.

f (z) =

∞Xn=0

an(f )zn

Now we turn our attention to harmonic functions. Again, let U be a subset of
the plane that is open and connected. Recall that a function u : U → R is harmonic
if it is twice continuously diﬀerentiable and satisﬁes Laplace’s equation

∂2u
∂x2 +

∂2u
∂y2 = 0.

When u is harmonic on D, let ˜u denote the harmonic conjugate of u that maps 0
to 0. That is, ˜u is the harmonic function on D so that ˜u(0) = 0 and so that u and
˜u satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations:

∂u
∂x

=

∂ ˜u
∂y

∂u

= −

∂ ˜u

.

Let ˆu = u + i˜u. Thus, ˆu is analytic and is called the analytic extension of u.

When B is a Borel subset of the unit circle, there is a harmonic function u on
the unit disk so that for all unimodular ζ, limz→ζ u(z) = χB(ζ) (where χA denotes
the characteristic function of A); let ω(z, B, D) = u(z). The quantity ω(z, B, D) is
called the harmonic measure of B at z. For each z in the unit disk, ω(z, ·, D) is a
Borel probability measure on the unit circle. Moreover, ω(0, B, D) = (2π)−1λ(B)
[24].

An explicit formula for the harmonic measure of an open arc on the unit circle
can be obtained as follows. Let Log denote the principal branch of the complex
logarithm. That is,

Log(z) =Z z

2.3. Computable analysis. We now use the classical concepts of computability
in a discrete setting to deﬁne the concept of computability in a continuous setting.
A complex number z is computable if there is an algorithm that, given a non-
negative integer k as input, computes a rational point q so that |q − z| < 2−k.
A sequence {an}n∈Z of points in the plane is computable if there is an algorithm
that, given an n ∈ Z and a k ∈ N as input, computes a rational point q so that
|an − q| < 2−k.

Let us call a trigonometric polynomial τ rational if each of its coeﬃcients is a

rational point.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Suppose p ≥ 1 is a computable real and suppose f ∈ Lp[−π, π].
Then f is a computable vector of Lp[−π, π] if there is an algorithm that, given k ∈ N
as input, computes a rational polynomial τ so that kf − τ kp < 2−k.

In other words, a vector f ∈ Lp[−π, π] is computable if it is possible to compute

arbitrarily good approximations of f by rational trigonometric polynomials.

The next proposition states the fundamental computability results we shall need

about vectors in Lp[−π, π].

Proposition 2.2. Suppose p ≥ 1 is a computable real and f ∈ Lp[−π, π].

(1) If f is a computable vector, then kf kp and {cn(f )}n∈Z are computable.
(2) If p = 2, then f is computable if both kf k2 and {cn(f )}n∈Z are computable.

Proof. Suppose τ is a rational trigonometric polynomial. The Lp-norm of τ can be
computed directly from τ . Since |kf kp − kτ kp| ≤ kf − τ kp, it follows that kf kp is
computable. We also have

where the last step is by Jensen’s Inequality. It follows that {cn(f )}n∈Z is com-

Now suppose p = 2 and suppose {cn(f )}n∈Z and kf k2 are computable. Since

The following corollary shows that the computability of a vector in Lp[−π, π] is

distinct from the computability of its Fourier coeﬃcients.
Corollary 2.3. There is an incomputable vector f ∈ L2[−π, π] so that {cn(f ))}n∈Z
is computable.

We now discuss computability of planar sets and functions. A comprehensive
treatment of the computability of functions and sets in continuous settings can
be found in [51]; the reader may also see [49], [25], [32], [33], [7], [44], and [8]. To
begin, an interval is rational if its endpoints are rational numbers. An open (closed)
rational rectangle is a Cartesian product of open (closed) rational intervals.

An open subset of the plane U is computably open if it is open and the set of
all closed rational rectangles that are included in U is computably enumerable. On
the other hand, an open subset of the real line X is computably open if the set of
all closed rational intervals that are included in X is computably open. A sequence
of open sets of reals {Un}n∈N is computable if Un is computably open uniformly
in n; that is, if there is an algorithm that, given any n ∈ N as input, produces an
algorithm that enumerates the closed rational intervals included in Un.

Suppose X is a compact subset of the plane. A minimal cover of X is a ﬁnite

sequence of open rational rectangles (R0, . . . , Rm) so that X ⊆Sj Rj and so that

X ∩ Rj 6= ∅ for all j ≤ m. We say that X is computably compact if the set of all
minimal covers of X is computably enumerable.

Suppose f is a function that maps complex numbers to complex numbers. We
say that f is computable if there is an algorithm P that satisﬁes the following three
criteria.

• Approximation: Whenever P is given an open rational rectangle as input,
it either does not halt or produces an open rational rectangle as output.
(Here, the input rectangle is regarded as an approximation of some z ∈
dom(f ) and the output rectangle is regarded as an approximation of f (z).)
• Correctness: Whenever P halts on an open rational rectangle R, the rec-

tangle it outputs contains f (z) for each z ∈ R ∩ dom(f ).

• Convergence: Suppose U is a neighborhood of a point z ∈ dom(f ) and
that V is a neighborhood of f (z). Then, there is an open rational rectangle
R such that R contains z, R is included in U , and when R is put into P ,
P produces a rational rectangle that is included in V .

For example, sin, cos, and exp are computable as can be seen by considering their
power series expansions and the bounds on the convergence of these series that
can be obtained from Taylor’s Theorem. A consequence of this deﬁnition is that
computable functions on the complex plane must be continuous.

A sequence of functions {fn}n∈N of a complex variable is computable if it is
computable uniformly in n; that is, there is an algorithm that given any n ∈ N as
input produces an algorithm that computes fn.

It is well known that integration is a computable functional on C[0, 1]. It fol-
lows that when f is a computable analytic function on the unit disk, the sequence
{an(f )}n∈N is computable uniformly in f . It also follows that Log is computable.
A modulus of convergence for a sequence {an}n∈N of points in a complete metric
space (X, d) is a function g : N → N so that d(am, an) < 2−k whenever m, n ≥ g(k).
Thus, a sequence of points in a complete metric space converges if and only if it has a
modulus of convergence. Suppose p ≥ 1 is computable. If {fn}n∈N is a computable

6

and convergent sequence of vectors in Lp[−π, π], then limn fn is a computable vector
if and only if {fn}n∈N has a computable modulus of convergence.

Suppose f is a uniformly continuous computable function that maps complex
numbers to complex numbers. A modulus of uniform continuity for f is a function
m : N → N so that |f (z0) − f (z1)| < 2−k whenever z0, z1 ∈ dom(f ) and |z0 − z1| ≤
2−m(k).
If the domain of f is computably compact, then f has a computable
modulus of uniform continuity.

n=0 anzn converges

of uniform convergence for this series on G is a function m : N → N so that

We note that when p ≥ 1 is a computable real and f ∈ Lp[−π, π], there are two
senses in which f can be “computable”: as a vector and as a function. These fail
to coincide. By deﬁnition, a computable function is continuous. However, there
are discontinuous functions in L1[−π, π] that are computable as vectors; e.g., the
greatest integer function. Moreover, there are continuous functions in L1[−π, π]
that are computable as vectors but not as functions.

n=0 anzn has a

Lastly, a lower semicomputable function is a function T : [−π, π] → [0, ∞] that

is the sum of a computable sequence of nonnegative real-valued functions.

2.4. Algorithmic randomness. There are three diﬀerent approaches to deﬁning
the concept of randomness formally. The one we will ﬁnd useful for this paper is
the measure-theoretic one: A random point in a given probability space is said to
be random if it avoids all null classes generated in a certain way by computably
enumerable functions. Thus, for any reasonable randomness notion, the class of
random points is conull. For a general introduction to algorithmic randomness, see
[14] or [39].

While the most-studied randomness notion is Martin-L¨of randomness, a weaker
notion, Schnorr randomness, lies at the heart of our paper. Schnorr randomness,
like most other randomness notions, was originally deﬁned in the Cantor space
2ω with Lebesgue measure [47]; however, the deﬁnition is easily adaptable to any
computable measure space, in particular [−π, π] with the Lebesgue measure µ.

Deﬁnition 2.4. A Schnorr test is a computable sequence {Vn}n∈N of open sets
of reals so that µ(Vn) ≤ 2−n for all n and so that the sequence {µ(Vn)}n∈N is
computable. A real number x is said to be Schnorr random if for every Schnorr

test {Vn}n∈N, x 6∈Tn Vn.

There are many other characterizations of Schnorr randomness, such as a complexity-

based characterization [13] and a martingale characterization [47]. In this paper,
we will use an integral test characterization due to Miyabe [35] which is rooted in
computable analysis.

Deﬁnition 2.5. A Schnorr integral test is a lower semicomputable function T :

[−π, π] → [0, ∞] so thatR π

−π T dµ is a computable real.

Thus, if T is a Schnorr integral test, then T (x) is ﬁnite for almost every x ∈
[−π, π]. Miyabe’s characterization states that x ∈ [−π, π] is Schnorr random if and
only if T (x) < ∞ for every Schnorr integral test T .

3. Proof of Theorem 1.1

Our proof of Theorem 1.1 is based on the following deﬁnition and lemmas.

Deﬁnition 3.1. Suppose {fn}n∈N is a sequence of functions on [−π, π]. A function
η : N × N → N is a modulus of almost-everywhere convergence for {fn}n∈N if

µ({t ∈ [−π, π]

: ∃M, N ≥ η(k, m) |fN (t) − fM (t)| ≥ 2−k}) < 2−m

for all k and m.

Thus, every sequence of functions on [−π, π] that converges almost everywhere
has a modulus of almost-everywhere convergence. Our goal, as stated in the fol-
lowing lemma, is to show that the sequence of partial sums for the Fourier series of
a computable vector in Lp[−π, π] has a computable modulus of almost-everywhere
convergence.

Lemma 3.2. Suppose p is a computable real so that p > 1, and suppose f is a
computable vector in Lp[−π, π]. Then, {SN (f )}N ∈N has a computable modulus of
almost-everywhere convergence.

With this lemma in hand, Theorem 1.1 follows from the next lemma.

Lemma 3.3. Assume {fn}n∈N is a uniformly computable sequence of functions on
[−π, π] for which there is a computable modulus of almost-everywhere convergence.
Then, the sequence {fn}n∈N converges at every Schnorr random real.

Generalizations of Lemma 3.3 can be found in Galatolo, Hoyrup, and Rojas [23,
Thm. 1] and well as Rute [45, Lemma 3.19 on p. 41]. Our proof is new. Theorem
1.1 follows by applying Lemma 3.3 to the sequence of partial sums of f .

Proof of Lemma 3.2. We compute η : N2 → N as follows. Let k, m ∈ N be given
as input. Compute a rational trigonometric polynomial τk,m so that kf − τk,mkp ≤
2−(m+k+3)C−1 where C is as in Feﬀerman’s inequality. Then deﬁne η(k, m) to be
the degree of τk,m.

By deﬁnition, η is computable. We now show that it is a modulus of almost-

everywhere convergence. We begin with some notation. Let g ∈ Lp[−π, π]. Set

Ek,N0 (g) = {t ∈ [−π, π]

: ∃M, N ≥ N0 |SM (g)(t) − SN (g)(t)| ≥ 2−k}.

Thus, we aim to show that µ(Ek,η(k,m)(f )) < 2−m. For each k ∈ N, let

ˆEk(g) = {t ∈ [−π, π]

|SN (g)(t)| > 2−k}.

: sup
N

It follows that Ek,N0 (g) ⊆ ˆEk+2(g).

We claim that Ek,η(k,m)(f ) ⊆ Ek,η(k,m)(f −τk,m). We see that if M, N ≥ η(k, m),

then

|SM (f )(t) − SN (f )(t)| ≤ |SM (f − τk,m)(t) − SN (f − τk,m)(t)| + |SM (τk,m)(t) − SN (τk,m)(t)|

= |SM (f − τk,m)(t) − SN (f − τk,m)(t)|.

Thus, Ek,η(k,m)(f ) ⊆ Ek,η(k,m)(f − τk,m).

It now follows that Ek,η(k,m)(f ) ⊆ ˆEk+2(f − τk,m). We complete the proof
by showing that µ( ˆEk+2(f − τk,m)) < 2−m. By Feﬀerman’s Inequality and the
deﬁnition of τk,m,

|SN (f − τk,m)|k1 ≤ 2−(m+k+3).

k sup
N

8

FRANKLIN, MCNICHOLL, AND RUTE

Thus, by Chebyshev’s Inequality,

µ( ˆEk+2(f − τk,m)) ≤ 2−(m+k+3)2k+2 = 2−(m+1) < 2−m.

Hence, µ( ˆEk+2(f − τk,m)) < 2−m.

(cid:3)

Proof of Lemma 3.3. We apply Miyabe’s characterization of Schnorr randomness.
We begin by deﬁning a Schnorr integral test as follows. Let η be a computable
modulus of almost-everywhere convergence for {fn}n∈N, and abbreviate η(k, k) by
Nk. For each k ∈ N and each t ∈ [−π, π] deﬁne

gk(t) = min {1, max{|fM (t) − fN (t))| : Nk < M, N ≤ Nk+1}} .

k=0 gk.

We now show that T is a Schnorr integral test. By construction, T is lower
−π T dµ is a computable real.
To this end, let m ∈ N be given. Since gk is computable uniformly in k, it is possible
k=0 gk − q| < 2−(m+1). We claim that

The sequence {gk}k∈N is computable. Set T =P∞
semicomputable. Therefore, it suﬃces to show thatR π

Thus, R π
Hence,R π

Finally, we show that T (t0) = ∞ whenever {fn(t0)}n∈N diverges. This will
complete the proof of the lemma. Suppose {fn(t0)}n∈N diverges. Then there exists
k0 ∈ N so that lim supM,N |fM (t0) − fN (t0)| ≥ 2−k0 . It thus suﬃces to show that
gk(t0) ≥ 2−k0 for all k1 ∈ N. So, let k1 ∈ N. Without loss of generality,
suppose gk < 1 whenever k ≥ k1. By the choice of k0, there exist M and N so that
Nk1 ≤ M < N and |fM (t0) − fN (t0)| ≥ 2−k0. By forming a telescoping sum and
applying the triangle inequality we obtain

k=k1

|fM (t0) − fN (t0)| ≤

Thus T (t0) = ∞, and the proof is complete.

Our proof of Theorem 1.2 is based on a construction of Kahane and Katznelson

[29] and requires the following sequence of three lemmas.

λ(G) is computable and smaller than 2π. Then there is a computable function ψ
from D ∪ G into the horizontal strip R × (− π
2 ) that is analytic on D and has the
property that Re(ψ(ζ)) ≥ − 3
4 ln(λ(G)(2π)−1) for all ζ ∈ G. Furthermore, we may
choose ψ so that ψ(0) = 0.

Set F =Sj≤s Aj and set a′ = λ(F )/(2π). For each z ∈ D∪G, let φ(x) = ˆω(z, F, D).

Thus, φ is computable and φ is analytic in D. By Equation (2.2), φ(0) = a′. It
also follows that Re(φ(z)) > 0 for all z ∈ D ∪ G. So, for all z ∈ D ∪ G, set
ψ1(z) = Log(φ(z)). Thus, ψ1(0) = ln(a′). Set ψ(z) = ψ1(z)−ln(a′) for all z ∈ D∪G.
Hence, ψ1 and ψ are computable.

Since kpn,kk∞ < 2−(n+k+1), it follows that f is computable.

and M ≥ hn, ki ≥ hn, 0i. By the construction of pn,k, there exists N so that
M ≤ N ≤ N ′ and |SN (f )(t0) − SM (f )(t0)| > (8π)−1.

Thus, the Fourier series for f diverges at t0.

5. A strengthening of Theorem 1.1; convergence to f (t0)

Throughout this subsection, p denotes a computable real such that p ≥ 1.
In Theorem 1.1 we showed that SN (f )(t0) converges for Schnorr randoms t0
and computable vectors f ∈ Lp[−π, π]. However, one would like to also say that
{SN (f )(t0)}N ∈N converges to f (t0). The problem is that f is merely a vector in
Lp[−π, π], and so f (t0) is not well deﬁned. Recall that a vector in Lp[−π, π] is
actually an equivalence class of functions under the “equal almost everywhere” re-
lation, and so every complex number is a candidate for the value of f (t0). Thus, the
limit of {SN (f )(t0)}N ∈N may not be f (t0) even if t0 is Schnorr random.1 However,
this problem has a solution via Cauchy names, a standard device in computable
analysis.

Deﬁnition 5.1. A sequence of rational trigonometric polynomials {τn}n∈N is a
Cauchy name of a vector f ∈ Lp[−π, π] if limn→∞ kτn − f kp = 0 and if kτn −
τn+1kp < 2−(n+1) for all n ∈ N.

Thus, a Cauchy name of a vector in Lp[−π, π] is a name of exactly one such

vector (up to almost everywhere equality).

A Cauchy name {τn}n∈N of a vector is computable if {τn}n∈N is a uniformly
computable sequence of rational trigonometric polynomials in the sense that the

1For example, Pour-El and Richards [44, p. 114] remark, “Of course, pointwise evaluation
makes no sense for Lp-functions, since an Lp-function is only determined up to sets of measure zero.
This limitation already exists in classical analysis, without any notions of logical ‘eﬀectiveness’
being required. By its very nature, an Lp-function is known only on the average.”

12

FRANKLIN, MCNICHOLL, AND RUTE

degree and coeﬃcients of τn can be computed from n. It follows that a vector in
Lp[−π, π] is computable if and only if it has a computable Cauchy name.

We will show that there is a natural way to use a computable Cauchy name of
f ∈ Lp[−π, π] to assign a canonical value to f (t0) when t0 is Schnorr random. We
will then show that if f is a computable vector in Lp[−π, π], then limN→∞ SN (f )(t0)
is the canonical value of f (t0) whenever t0 is Schnorr random. Our approach is
based on the following theorem which eﬀectivizes a well-known result in measure
theory; namely, that a convergent sequence in Lp[−π, π] has a subsequence that
converges almost everywhere.

Theorem 5.2. Suppose fn ∈ Lp[−π, π] for all n ∈ N and suppose g is a computable
modulus of convergence for {fn}n∈N. Then, η(k, m) = ⌈ 1
p + k + 1)⌉ deﬁnes a
modulus of almost-everywhere convergence for {fg(2n)}n∈N.

2 ( m+1

Proof. Set

En,r = {t ∈ [−π, π]

:

|fg(2n+1)(t) − fg(2n)(t)| ≥ 2−r}.

Since g is a modulus of convergence for {fn}n∈N, kfg(2n+1) − fg(2n)kp
Thus, by Chebychev’s Inequality, µ(En,r) ≤ 2p(r−2n).

p < 2−2np.

Set N0 = η(k, m). Suppose M, N ≥ N0 and |fg(2M)(t) − fg(2N )(t)| ≥ 2−k. Then

2−k ≤

It follows that η is a modulus of almost-
(cid:3)

Corollary 5.3. If {τn}n∈N is a computable Cauchy name for a vector in Lp[−π, π]
and if t0 ∈ [−π, π] is Schnorr random, then {τ2n(t0)}n∈N converges.

Corollary 5.3 leads to the idea that a Cauchy name for f assigns a value to f (t)

for Schnorr random t.

Deﬁnition 5.4. If {τn}n∈N is a computable Cauchy name for a vector f ∈ Lp[−π, π],
and if {τ2n(t)}n∈N converges to α ∈ C, then we say {τn}n∈N assigns the value α to
f (t).

Thus, if f is a computable vector in Lp[−π, π] and if t0 is Schnorr random, then
a value is assigned to f (t0) by each computable Cauchy name of f . We now show
that the same value is assigned by all computable Cauchy names via the following
proposition.

Proposition 5.5. Suppose {fn}n∈N and {gn}n∈N are computable sequence of func-
tions on [−π, π] and that each has a computable modulus of almost-everywhere con-
vergence. Suppose also that limn→∞ fn(t) − gn(t) = 0 for almost every t ∈ [−π, π].
Then, limn→∞ fn(t0) = limn→∞ gn(t0) whenever t0 ∈ [−π, π] is Schnorr random.

ALGORITHMIC RANDOMNESS AND FOURIER ANALYSIS

13

Proof. Let η0 be a computable modulus of almost-everywhere convergence for
{fn}n∈N, and let η1 be a computable modulus of almost-everywhere convergence
for {gn}n∈N. Let h2n = fn, and let h2n+1 = gn. Set η(k, m) = η0(k + 1, m + 2) +
η1(k + 1, m + 2). It follows that η is a computable modulus of almost-everywhere
convergence for {hn}n∈N. So, if t0 is Schnorr random, then {hn(t0)}n∈N converges,
and so {fn(t0)}n∈N and {gn(t0)}n∈N converge to the same value.
(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 5.6. Suppose f is a computable vector in Lp[−π, π]. When t0 is Schnorr
random, the canonical value of f (t0) is the value assigned to f (t0) by a computable
Cauchy name of f .

By Proposition 5.5, the choice of computable Cauchy name does not matter.

Note that if f is continuous, then the canonical value of f (t0) is in fact f (t0).

Proposition 5.5 yields an extension of Theorem 1.1.

Corollary 5.7. Suppose p > 1 and suppose f is a computable vector in Lp[−π, π].
Then, {SN (f )(t0)}N ∈N converges to the canonical value of f (t0) whenever t0 is
Schnorr random.

It should also be remarked that these canonical values are similar to Miyabe’s

Schnorr layerwise computable functions from [35].

6. The p = 1 case; characterizing Schnorr randomness via the

Fej´er-Lebesgue Theorem

Carleson’s Theorem does not hold for vectors in L1[π, π]. Indeed, Kolmogorov
[31] constructed a complex-valued function f in L1[π, π] for which {SN (f )(t)}N ∈N
diverges almost everywhere (later improved to “diverges everywhere”). Moser [37]
further constructed a computable such f . Nonetheless, Fej´er and Lebesgue proved
that the Ces´aro means of {SN (f )}N ∈N converge to f almost everywhere. In this
section, we will show that the exceptional set of this theorem also characterizes
Schnorr randomness. We begin by reviewing the relevant components of the clas-
sical theory. We will then discuss their eﬀective renditions.

Recall that the (N + 1)st Ces´aro mean of a sequence {an}n∈N is

1

N + 1

an.

NXn=0

If {an}n∈N converges, then so does the sequence of its Ces´aro means and to the
same limit. Ces´aro means provide a widely-used method for “evaluating divergent

series;” e.g., the Ces´aro means of the partial sums ofP∞

Now ﬁx a vector f ∈ L1[−π, π]. Let σN (f ) denote the (N + 1)st Ces´aro mean of

{SN (f )}N ∈N. That is,

Recall that t0 ∈ [−π, π] is a Lebesgue point of f if

lim
ǫ→0+

t0−ǫ

|f (t) − f (t0)| dt = 0.

One of Lebesgue’s diﬀerentiation theorems states that almost every point in [−π, π]
is a Lebesgue point of f . Building on Fej´er’s work on Ces´aro means of Fourier series,
Lebesgue then showed that {σN (f )(t0)}N ∈N converges to f (t0) whenever t0 is a
Lebesgue point of f [34]. Fej´er also showed that {σN (f )}N ∈N converges uniformly
if f is continuous and periodic (in the sense that f (π) = f (−π)).

The result of this section can now be stated as follows.

Theorem 6.1. Suppose t0 ∈ [−π, π]. Then, t0 is Schnorr random if and only if
{σN (f )(t0)}N ∈N converges to the canonical value of f (t0) whenever f is a com-
putable vector in L1[−π, π].

Proof. Suppose t0 is Schnorr random, and let f be a computable vector in L1[−π, π].

dependently, Pathak, Rojas, and Simpson [43] and Rute [45] showed that every

Let ef denote the function so that ef (t) equals the canonical value of f (t) when t
is Schnorr random and is 0 otherwise. Call ef the canonical version of f .
Schnorr random t0 is a Lebesgue point of ef . Since ef (t) = f (t) almost everywhere,
σN (ef ) = σN (f ). Thus, by the Fej´er-Lebesgue Theorem, {σN (f )(t0)}N ∈N converges

Now, suppose t0 is not Schnorr random. Then there is a Schnorr integral test T
so that T (t0) = ∞. We claim that T is a computable vector in L1[−π, π]. Suppose
n=0 gn where {gn}n∈N is a computable sequence of nonnegative functions.
n=0 kgnk1. Let k ∈ N be given.
Since kT k1 is computable, from k we can compute a nonnegative integer m so

n=0 gnk1 < 2−(k+1). It

n=0 gk. Fix k ∈ N. Since
FN ≥ 0, it follows from Equation 6.1 that σN (T )(t0) ≥ σN (hk)(t0). Since hk is
continuous at t0, t0 is a Lebesgue point for hk and so limN→∞ σN (hk)(t0) = hk(t0).
Thus, limN σN (T )(t0) ≥ hk(t0). It follows that limN→∞ σN (f )(t0) = ∞.
(cid:3)

follows that kT − τ k1 < 2−k.

The forward direction of Theorem 6.1 ﬁrst appeared in Rute’s dissertation [45,
Cor. 4.22 on p. 49]. Note that if f : [−π, π] → C is continuous, then every number
in [−π, π] is a Lebesgue point of f . Thus, the converse of Theorem 6.1 cannot be
made as strong as Theorem 1.2.

The proof of the converse of Theorem 6.1 can easily be adapted to the case
where f ∈ Lp[−π, π] and p ≥ 1. In addition, the proof of this direction shows that
if T ≥ 0 is a lower semicontinuous and integrable function (possibly with inﬁnite
values) and if p ≥ 1, then there is a vector f ∈ Lp[−π, π] so that {σN (f )(t)}N ∈N
diverges whenever T (t) = ∞. If E is a measure zero subset of [−π, π], then there
is a lower semicontinuous and non-negative function T so that kT k1 < ∞ and so

ALGORITHMIC RANDOMNESS AND FOURIER ANALYSIS

that T (t) = ∞ whenever t ∈ E. We thus obtain the following extension of a result
of Katznelson by a simpler proof [30].

Theorem 6.2. Suppose p ≥ 1, and suppose E is a measure 0 subset of [−π, π].
Then there exists f ∈ Lp[−π, π] so that {σN (f )(t)}N ∈N diverges whenever t ∈ E.

7. Conclusion

We have used algorithmic randomness to study an almost-everywhere conver-
gence theorem in analysis. Many of these theorems have already been investigated,
including the ergodic theorem [20, 22, 27, 50], the martingale convergence theorem
[45], the Lebesgue Diﬀerentiation Theorem [43, 45], Rademacher’s Theorem [21],
and Lebesgue’s theorem concerning the diﬀerentiability of bounded variation func-
tions [6]. This list is not exhaustive and more work needs to be done. In some cases,
the resulting randomness notion is Schnorr randomness. In others, it is Martin-L¨of
randomness or computable randomness.

In this conclusion, we would like to share some intuition about why Carleson’s
Theorem characterizes Schnorr randomness and what clues one might look for when
investigating similar theorems. Namely, we are interested in almost-everywhere
convergence theorems stating that for a family F of sequences of functions, ev-
ery sequence {fn}n∈N in the family converges almost everywhere.
In Carleson’s
Theorem, F is the family of sequences {SN (f )}N ∈N for f ∈ Lp.

The main clue that {SN (f )}N ∈N converges on Schnorr randoms, is that the
pointwise limit of this sequence is computable from the parameter f (indeed the
limit is f ). In such cases where the limit is computable, one can usually (at least
from our experience) ﬁnd a computable modulus of almost-everywhere convergence.
This allows one to apply Lemma 3.3 or one of its generalizations to show that the
sequence {fn}n∈N converges for Schnorr randoms (e.g. Theorem 1.1).
In some
cases, this rate of convergence follows from well-known quantitative estimates—
Feﬀerman’s Inequality in our case. Moreover, in convergence theorems where the
limit is computable, these theorems are usually constructively provable. We conjec-
ture that Carleson’s Theorem is provable in the logical frameworks of Bishop style
constructivism and RCA0.

On the other hand, if we are working with a theorem, such as the ergodic the-
orem, where the limit of the theorem is not always computable, then it is unlikely
that the sequence {fn}n∈N converges for all Schnorr randoms. Instead, one should
look into weaker randomness notions, such as Martin-L¨of and computable ran-
domness. Nonetheless, convergence on Schnorr randoms can often be recovered by
restricting the theorem. For example, with the ergodic theorem, convergence hap-
pens on Schnorr randoms if the system is ergodic (or in any case where the limit is
computable).

Lastly, “reversals” similar to Theorem 1.2 are usually eﬀective proofs of a stronger
result. For example, Miyabe’s characterization of the Schnorr randoms yields proof
of the following principle: If E ⊆ [−π, π] is a null set, then there is a lower semicon-
tinuous and integrable function T : [−π, π] → [0, ∞] so that T (t0) = ∞ whenever
t0 ∈ E. If we relativize Theorem 1.2, then we get Kahane and Katznelson’s result
[29] that for every null set E, there is a continuous function f such that {SN (f )}N ∈N
diverges on E. However, the relativizations of the lemmas in Section 4 strengthen
the intermediate results in [29], and we have endeavored to carefully justify many

16

important details. Similarly, if an almost-everywhere convergence theorem charac-
terizes a standard randomness notion, then it usually satisﬁes the following prop-
erty: For every null set E there is a sequence {fn}n∈N for which the theorem says
{fn}n∈N converges almost everywhere, but {fn}n∈N diverges on E. Not all almost-
everywhere theorems satisfy this property. Nonetheless, this property does seem to
be satisﬁed by theorems where the parameters of the theorem are functions in Lp,
such as Carleson’s Theorem and the Lebesgue diﬀerentiation theorem.
