Powerful winds driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) are often invoked to play a fundamental role in the evolution
of both supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies, quenching star formation and explaining the tight
SMBH-galaxy relations. A strong support of this quasar mode feedback came from the recent X-ray observation of a mildly
relativistic accretion disk wind in a ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) and its connection with a large-scale molecular
outﬂow, providing a direct link between the SMBH and the gas out of which stars form. Spectroscopic observations,
especially in the X-ray band, show that such accretion disk winds may be common in local AGN and quasars. However,
their origin and characteristics are still not fully understood. Detailed theoretical models and simulations focused on
radiation, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) or a combination of these two processes to investigate the possible acceleration
mechanisms and the dynamics of these winds. Some of these models have been directly compared to X-ray spectra,
providing important insights into the wind physics. However, fundamental improvements on these studies will come only
from the unprecedented energy resolution and sensitivity of the upcoming X-ray observatories, namely ASTRO-H (launch
date early 2016) and Athena (2028).

1 Introduction

Most galaxies host a supermassive black hole (SMBH)
at their center, with masses ranging from a few million
(e.g., for the one in our Milky Way) up to several billion
times the one of the Sun. Surprisingly, the SMBH mass
is found to correlate with several properties of the host
galaxy. For instance, galaxies hosting more massive black
holes also possess more massive bulges that contain on av-
erage faster-moving stars (e.g., Magorrian et al. 1998; Fer-
rarese & Merritt 2000). This suggests some sort of feed-
back mechanism(s) between a galaxy’s black hole and the
star-formation process. Yet there is still no adequate expla-
nation for how a black hole’s activity, which in principle
may affect only a region of few times the size of our so-
lar system, could actually inﬂuence a whole galaxy, which
encompasses regions roughly a billion times larger.

During their active phases, accreting SMBHs can inject
signiﬁcant amounts of energy in their surroundings and they
are called active galactic nuclei (AGN). Therefore, observa-
tions of AGN provide the key to directly study the feedback
phenomenon in action. Radiation and jets from AGN can
indeed interact with the interstellar medium leading to ejec-
tion or heating of the gas. However, they alone are not able
to establish the intricate accretion/ejection feedback cycle
linking the central SMBH to its host galaxy (e.g., Fabian

2012; Pounds 2014; King & Pounds 2015; Combes 2015).
Increasing evidence point toward another promising player
in AGN feedback: accretion disk winds. Observations in the
X-ray band are particularly important because this radiation
is produced very close to the central SMBH and it is en-
ergetic enough to pass through dense layers of absorbing
material, therefore retaining a wealth of information about
the AGN and the host galaxy environment.

This brief review paper is organized as follows: in §2
we describe the X-ray observations of disk winds, in §3 we
compare the models that have been proposed for their char-
acterization, in §4 we discuss the AGN feedback from these
disk winds, and in §5 we show some of the fundamental im-
provements expected from upcoming X-ray observatories.

2 X-ray observations of disk winds

The ﬁrst evidence of ionized absorption in the X-ray spec-
trum of an AGN was reported by Halpern (1984) comparing
two spectra of the quasar MR 2251−178 taken in 1979 and
1980 with the Einstein satellite. The data showed a change
in the soft X-ray band, which was interpreted as an ionized
cloud crossing the continuum source.

The advent of the higher energy resolution grating spec-
trometers onboard Chandra and XMM-Newton provided a
revolution in these studies, showing that the absorption is
be composed of a number of lines and edges from differ-
ent elements at different ionization states (e.g., Kaspi et

c(cid:13) WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

2

F. Tombesi: Accretion disk winds in active galactic nuclei

al. 2002). Importantly, the energies of these lines are found
to be systematically blue-shifted compared to the expected
values, indicating that the material is likely a wind outﬂow-
ing from the central regions of these galaxies with veloci-
ties in the range of vout∼100–1,000 km s−1 (e.g., Kaastra
et al. 2000; McKernan etal 2007; Gofford et al. 2011; Lob-
ban et al. 2011; Detmers et al. 2011; Reeves et al. 2013;
Kaastra et al. 2014). Overall, such warm absorbers (WAs)
are detected in more than half of local Seyfert galaxies and
have ionization and column densities in the range logξ∼1–
3 erg s−1 cm and NH ∼1020–1022 cm−2, respectively (e.g.,
Crenshaw & Kraemer 2012).

A more extreme type of outﬂows, often referred to as ul-
trafast outﬂows (UFOs), are instead observed mostly in the
Fe K band through blue-shifted Fe XXV and Fe XXVI ab-
sorption lines (e.g. Chartas et al. 2002; Pounds et al. 2003;
Dadina et al. 2005; Reeves et al. 2009; Cappi et al. 2009;
Tombesi et al. 2010a, b; Giustini et al. 2011; Gofford et al.
2013; Tombesi et al. 2014; Nardini et al. 2015; Tombesi et
al. 2015; but see also Gupta et al 2013, 2015 for UFO detec-
tions in the soft X-rays). The UFOs are highly ionized, with
ionization parameter logξ∼4–6 erg s−1 cm. They can have
high column densities in the range NH ∼1022–1024 cm−2.
Most importantly, the implied outﬂow velocities are often
mildly relativistic, in the range vout∼0.03–0.3 c, where c is
the speed of light (e.g., Tombesi et al. 2011; Gofford et al.
2013).

The large dynamic range obtained when considering the
WAs and UFOs together, spanning several orders of mag-
nitude in ionization, column density, velocity and distance
suggests that the closer is the absorber to the central black
hole, the higher are the values of these parameters and con-
sequently the mechanical power. This suggests that these
absorbers could represent parts of a same large-scale out-
ﬂow observed at different locations from the black hole.
The UFOs are likely launched from the inner accretion disk
and the WAs at larger distances, of the order of pc-scales or
larger (e.g. Blustin et al. 2005; Tombesi et al. 2012a, 2013;
Gofford et al. 2015).

3 Models of disk winds

The detailed acceleration mechanisms of disk winds in
AGN are still matter of intense research. However, they
can be classiﬁed in thermal, radiation and magnetohydro-
dynamic (MHD), depending on their main driving force.

Thermal-driven winds are accelerated by the thermal
pressure of the gas and they can reach a maximum velocity
of ∼1,000 km s−1. They are ejected from the outer accre-
tion disk or obscuring torus at ∼pc scales from the central
SMBH. Some of the WA components in Seyferts may be as-
sociated with such winds (e.g., Chelouche & Netzer 2005).
Given the intense radiation ﬁeld in most AGN, radia-
tion pressure itself can be a very effective way to drive a
disk wind (e.g., Elvis 2000; Sim et al. 2008, 2010, 2012;
Ohsuga et al. 2009). The main source of opacity is due to

Fig. 1 Best-ﬁt radiation-driven wind model of one Suzaku
spectrum of PDS 456 observed in 2013, from Hagino et
al. (2015).

UV absorption lines (e.g., Proga, Stone & Kallman 2000;
Higginbottom et al. 2014). Compton scattering can also be
effective if the luminosity of the source is close to Edding-
ton (e.g., King & Pounds 2003). The wind is ejected from
different locations on the accretion disk and can be acceler-
ated to very high velocities, up to values of vout∼0.1c. This
provides a very promising explanation for the observations
of UFOs in luminous AGN.

For instance, a case study was recently reported for
PDS 456 by Hagino et al. (2015), see Fig. 1. Using the
MONACO radiation transfer code, they have been able to
model the blue-shifted Fe XXV–XXVI absorption lines due
to the disk wind in the Suzaku spectra of this source. They
estimanted fundamental parameters of the wind, such as an
inner launching radius of ∼10rs (rs = 2GMBH/c2), in-
clination angle of ∼48◦ and an outﬂow velocity of ∼0.3c.
The higher the inclination angle, the higher is the EW of
the line due to the inclrease in column density. Instead, the
inner radius mostly affects the velocity centroid and shape
of the line. Thus, the smaller is the radius, the higher is the
velocity and the broader is the high energy wing of the line
(e.g., Fukumura et al. 2015).

Another promising possibility to explain the origin of
disk winds in AGN (and possibly also X-ray binaries) is of-
fered by MHD models (e.g., Kazanas et al. 2012). Magnetic
ﬁelds are fundamental for the onset of accretion and the for-
mation of relativistic jets, therefore it is plausible that they
may have an effect in the production of disk winds as well.
In this case the wind is accelerated by the centrifugal force
of the magnetic ﬁeld lines anchored on the disk and the
magnetic pressure (e.g., Blandford & Payne 1982; Konigl
& Kartje 1994; Proga 2000; Everett & Ballantyne 2004;
Everett 2005; Fukumura et al. 2010a). The wind is ejected
from different regions of the disk. This causes a stratiﬁca-
tion, with increasing column density, ionization and veloc-
ity closer to the central SMBH. In particular, the resultant

et al. (2015). The green, blue, and red lines indicate the case
without wind model, with inner wind radius ﬁxed to the in-
nermost stable circular orbit, and the best-ﬁt model with an
inner wind radius of ≃30rs, respectively.

wind velocity is proportional to the disk rotational velocity
at each radius and it can reach up to relativistic values (e.g.,
Fukumura et al. 2010b, 2014). The wind possibly originates
from just a few rs from the SMBH up to the outer disk or
torus.

The ﬁrst MHD modeling of an AGN disk wind ob-
served in the X-rays was recently reported by Fukumura et
al. (2015) for the quasar PG 1211+143, see Fig. 2. Using
the mhdwind model in XSPEC the authors have been able
to successfully parameterize the blue-shifted Fe K absorp-
tion line in the 2001 XMM-Newton spectrum of this source.
They estimate an inner wind launching radius of ∼30rs, an
inclination angle of ∼50◦ and an outﬂow velocity of ≃0.1–
0.2c.

These models provide a very good starting point for the
study of disk winds in AGN. However, it is important to
note that the real situation can be much more complex. In
fact, accretion and ejection physics should be considered
together in a self-consistent way. Therefore, the accretion
disk, the wind and the jet should be studied simultaneously
(e.g., Ohsuga et al. 2009; Tchekhovskoy et al. 2011; Sad-
owski et al. 2013, 2014; McKinney et al. 2014; Yuan &
Narayan 2014). Moreover, the different acceleration mech-
anisms can also be present at the same time or some of them
may dominate for certain wind launching radii. Bright radio
galaxies are promising candidates for these studies, as they
simultaneously show the disk, the wind and the jet (e.g.,
Marscher et al. 2002; Tombesi et al. 2012b, 2014).

4 AGN wind feedback

There are several indications of relations between SMBHs
and their host galaxies. For instance, the MBH–σ relation

ﬁle from a disk wind with velocity ≃0.3c, from Nardini et
al. (2015).

shows that the bigger the mass of the SMBH, the higher is
the velocity dispersion of stars in the galaxy bulge (e.g., Ko-
rmendy & Ho 2013). Moreover, large-scale computer sim-
ulations of galaxy evolution show that the high mass end
of the galaxy stellar mass function is over-predicted and
some phenomena should be responsible for the quenching
of the star formation. One promising possibly being feed-
back from the central SMBH (e.g., Bower et al. 2012).

Therefore, a fundamental question is, how do SMBHs
affect galaxy evolution? The typical radius of a SMBH is
∼109 times smaller than that of a galaxy. Considering the
volume, the SMBH is ∼1027 times smaller! Moreover, the
typical mass of a SMBH is only ∼1% of the stellar bulge
mass (e.g., Magorrian et al. 1998). However, it is important
to note that there is an huge amount of gravitational energy
“released” by SMBHs, which in total can be comparable to
the binding energy of the entire galaxy bulge! Therefore, if
there is a way to tap into this energy, SMBHs may have a
strong impact on the host galaxy.

Indeed, the conversion of gravitational energy into radi-
ation or jets and winds can have a profound impact on the
AGN host galaxy. Here, we focus more on the winds, which
are thought to be responsible for the so-called “quasar-
mode feedback” (e.g., Silk & Rees 1998; Fabian 2012;
King Pounds 2015). In this regard, two recent papers re-
ported compelling evidence for the presence of powerful
disk winds in quasars.

Combining simultaneous X-ray spectra collected with
XMM-Newton and NuSTAR, Nardini et al. (2015) showed
the clear presence of a P-Cygni line proﬁle in the Fe K band
of the luminous quasar PDS 456, see Fig. 3. This is due to
a powerful, large opening angle disk wind with an outﬂow
velocity of vout∼0.3c. This X-ray wind is observed close to
the accretion disk, but it is very likely to have a strong effect
at much larger scales in the host galaxy.

F. Tombesi: Accretion disk winds in active galactic nuclei

Fig. 4 Ratio between the Suzaku XIS0 (black), XIS1 (red)
and XIS3 (blue) spectra of IRAS F11119+3257 in the Fe K
band showing a clear broad and blue-shifted absorption line
from a disk wind with velocity of ≃0.25c, from Tombesi et
al. (2015).

On the other hand, Tombesi et al. (2015) reported, for
the ﬁrst time, the connection between a powerful accretion
disk wind detected in the X-ray band with Suzaku and a
large-scale molecular outﬂow detected in the IR with Her-
schel in IRAS F11119+3257, see Fig. 4. This is a local
(z = 0.189) ULIRG hosting a quasar in the center with a
luminosity of L≃1046 erg s−1 (Veilleux et al. 2013). This
source, as most ULIRGs, is likely the result of a previous
merger between two galaxies. Therefore, the study of this
type of objects is very important for the connection with
galaxy evolution and whether the merger process is an ef-
fective way to feed the central SMBH to very high rates
(within the uncertainties, this source is accreting at ∼5 times
the Eddington limit).

The OH 119µm line proﬁle in IRAS F11119+3257
shows a prominent P-Cygni proﬁle, indicating a molecular
outﬂow with maximum velocity of 1,000 km s−1 at a scale
of >300 pc from the SMBH. This corresponds to a very
high mass outﬂow rate of ∼800 M⊙ yr−1. The X-ray spec-
trum shows a broad and blue-shifted absorption line at the
energy of ≃9 keV. The best-ﬁt XSTAR model (Kallman &
Bautista 2001) indicates a highly ionized wind with outﬂow
velocity vout≃0.255c, column density NH ≃6 × 1024 cm−2
and covering fraction >0.85. The mechanical energy of the
disk wind and the molecular outﬂow are log ˙EK = 45.4+0.4
−0.5
erg s−1 and log ˙EK= 44.4±0.5 erg s−1, respectively. These
corresponds to ≃15% and ≃3% of the AGN luminosity,
respectively. The two values are consistent considering an
efﬁciency f =0.22 ± 0.07 derived from the ratios of the
two convering fractions. This result is in agreement with
the ”quasar-mode feedback” model in which the mildly-
relativistic disk wind produces a strong shock in the inter-
stellar medium, which then expands adiabatically as a hot
bubble and drives the molecular outﬂow at galaxy-scales

from the UFO with velocity vout≃0.23c. Both Fe K and sev-
eral lower-Z element lines will likely be detected with high
signiﬁcance.

(e.g., Zubovas & King 2012; Faucher-Gigu`ere & Quataert
2012; Wagner et al. 2013; Zubovas & Nayakshin 2014).

5 Future missions

Currently, only the CCD instruments onboard XMM-
Newton, Suzaku and NuSTAR have provided enough sen-
sitivity to study the crucial Fe K band in detail. In particu-
lar, they allowed the detection of UFOs at E>7 keV in lo-
cal AGN and to estimante their parameters. However, there
are still uncertainties, mostly from the fact that the width
of the lines is often unconstrained and the limited sensitiv-
ity to higher order Fe K line features. The improved energy
resolution of the microcalorimeters onboard ASTRO-H and
Athena will allow to study such Fe K features with unprece-
dented detail.

The ASTRO-H X-ray observatory (Takahashi et
al. 2014), with a launch date planned for early 2016, will
have a microcalorimenter with a unprecedented combina-
tion of high energy resolution of ≃5 eV and high sensitivity
in the broad energy range between E=0.5–10 keV. More-
over, ASTRO-H will have three other instruments, which
will allow to simultaneously cover whole X-ray band, from
0.5 keV up to 500 keV.

As a case study we consider the simulated ASTRO-H
observation of PDS 456 (for more details, see the AGN
winds White Paper by Kaastra et al. 2014). This is one
of the quasars with the most powerful UFO detected in
the X-rays. The UFO in PDS 456 was observed having
a variable column density in the range NH ≃1 × 1023–
8 × 1023 cm−2. The column density appears to be higher

PDS 456. Three representative proﬁles are shown for differ-
ent values of the wind inclination angle (i) and launching
radius (rin). The microcalorimeter will allow to explore the
geometry and acceleration of the wind.

for lower ﬂux states. We assume two representative cases, a
high ﬂux ( 3.6 × 10−12 erg s−1 cm−2 in the 2–10 keV)
/ low column (NH = 1 × 1023 cm−2) and a low ﬂux
(1.5 × 10−12 erg s−1 cm−2 in the 2–10 keV) / high col-
umn (NH = 5 × 1023 cm−2), respectively. We assume the
baseline model of Gofford et al. (2014). The exposure time
required to detect the UFO at ≥6σ signiﬁcance in both low
and high ﬂux cases is 150 ks.

The microcalorimeter observation will allow to estimate
the UFO parameters with unprecedented accuracy (NH at 5-
15%, logξ at 1-5% and vout at 0.5-1%). This is fundamental
to decrease the uncertainties on the mass outﬂow rate and
mechanical power of these winds and therefore to quantify
the impact of the SMBH on the host galaxy through AGN
feedback. From Fig. 5 we see that several other absorption
lines due to lower-Z elements at E<6 keV (mainly H/He-
like Ar, Ca, S, Si, Ne, O, Mg) may likely be observed in
the spectrum. This will provide an additional strong support
for the existence of the UFO than the Fe XXV-XXVI lines
alone.

Moreover, for the ﬁrst time, the microcalorimeter will
allow to resolve the line width with an accuracy of less than
10%. This will allow to measure the turbulent velocity of the
plasma. Moreover, the two Fe XXV Heα and Fe XXVI Lyα
lines will be distinguishable. Thus, the ASTRO-H observa-
tion will allow to explore different line broadening mech-
anisms. It will also be possible to investigate a distinction
between radiation pressure and MHD acceleration mecha-
nisms (e.g., Sim et al. 2008; Fukumura et al. 2010). In fact,
the shape of the magnetic ﬁeld lines in MHD winds and the
more equatorial geometry of the radiation driven case will

strongly affect the absorption line proﬁle (e.g., Giustini &
Proga 2012). In Fig. 6 we show the representative case of
an MHD disk wind proﬁle using the model of Fukumura et
al. (2010). Three representative proﬁles are shown for dif-
ferent values of the wind inclination angle (i=45◦–60◦) and
launching radius (rin=100–300 rg).

Another case study is the ASTRO-H observation of the
radio galaxy 3C 120 (for more details, see the Broad-band
White Paper by Coppi et al. 2014). This is one of the most
relevant and promising targets for exploring disk winds in
the context of the disk-jet coupling. Previous X-ray obser-
vations, augmented by the high-resolution radio data, hinted
at a close link between the inner disk state transitions, the jet
formation processes and possibly also UFO ejections (e.g.,
Marscher et al. 2002; Chatterjee et al. 2009; Tombesi et
al. 2012b; Lohﬁnk et al. 2013).

We consider the combined disk-jet model of Lohﬁnk et
al. (2013), in which the jet X-ray emission is parameterized
with a steep power-law with the photon index of 2.5 − 4,
while the disk (disk corona) continuum is represented by a
power-law component with the photon index of 1.7 − 2.4
and the high energy cut-off at 150 keV. In the ﬁrst case, the
disk extends down to the ISCO. This is modeled in XSPEC
with a relativistically blurred ionized reﬂection component
with q ≃ 7, inclination i ≃ 15◦, and the ionization ξ ≃
200 erg s−1 cm. The neutral distant reﬂector (pexmon) is in-
cluded with a reﬂection fraction R ≃ 2. In the second case,
which is related to the launch of the jet knot, the inner disk
is disrupted and the inner radius recedes to rin ≃ 38 rg. The
relativistic blurred reﬂection has now a more standard value
of q ≃ 3.5 and the neutral reﬂection fraction is R ≃ 0.26.
In this latter case, a UFO with the velocity vout ≃ 0.16 c

was detected by Tombesi et al. (2014). This outﬂow is mod-
eled with an XSTAR table assuming a turbulent velocity of
3,000 km s−1, ionization log ξ ≃ 4.9 erg s−1 cm, and col-
umn density NH ≃ 5 × 1022 cm−2. If modeled with an
inverted Gaussian absorption line, this is equivalent to the
energy of E ≃ 8.23 keV, line width of σ ≃ 110 eV, and
EW ≃ −20 eV.

The simulated 100 ks ASTRO-H broad-band spectrum
of 3C 120 is shown in Fig. 7. The source will be detected
at high signiﬁcance with all the four instruments, from
0.5 keV up to 300 keV. This will allow to simultaneously
constrain the corona continuum, the jet emission, and the
neutral/ionized reﬂection. In addition, the inner disk radius
will be measured with 15% accuracy. Moreover, the pres-
ence of the disk wind will be determined by means of the
detection of the Fe K UFO. In combination with an multi-
wavelength monitoring, will allow for a direct comparison
between the activity level of the intermittent jet, the state of
the accretion disk, and the energetics of the disk wind.

The very high effective area (more than ∼10x of
ASTRO-H) of the microcalorimeter onboard the future
(launch date 2028) Athena X-ray observatory (Nandra et
al. 2013) will allow to extend the study of AGN wind feed-
back to higher redshifts (z ≃2–3), where the peak of the
AGN population is expected. Moreover, it will be possible
to study not only the kinematics but also the dynamics of
disk winds in local Seyfert galaxies, thereby directly com-
paring the data with detailed simulations (Cappi et al. 2013).

6 Conclusions

Powerful winds driven by active galactic nuclei can play
a fundamental role in the evolution of both supermassive
black holes and their host galaxies, quenching star forma-
tion and explaining the tight SMBH-galaxy relations. A
strong support of this quasar mode feedback comes from X-
ray observation of mildly relativistic accretion disk winds
in active galaxies.The unprecedented energy resolution and
sensitivity of the upcoming X-ray observatories, namely
ASTRO-H and Athena, are expected to provide revolution-
ary improvements in this ﬁeld.
