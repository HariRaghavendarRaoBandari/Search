We suggest that dark matter may be partially constituted by a dilute ’t Hooft-Polyakov monopoles
gas. We reach this conclusion by using the Georgi-Glashow model coupled to a dual kinetic mixing
term F ˜G where F is the electromagnetic ﬁeld and G the ’t Hooft tensor. We show that these
monopoles carry both (Maxwell) electric and (Georgi-Glashow) magnetic charges and the electric
charge quantization condition is modiﬁed in terms of a dimensionless real parameter. This parameter
could be determined from milli-charged particle experiments.

The detection of dark matter is one of the most important challenges on high energy physics in present days
because its discovery would explain a number of very important unsolved problems in astrophysics, astronomy
and particle physics [1]. Since the dark matter interacts very weakly with visible matter, it seems that the most
promissory way to detect it would be through indirect methods as, for example, the detection of the products of the
annihilation of pairs of dark matter/anti-dark matter which could produce overabundance of visible matter or en-
ergy [2]. Direct detection methods, on the other hand, has also been proposed and it is a very active ﬁeld of research [3].

The expected overabundance of visible matter could be explained via annihilation of dark matter (χ) processes of

the type

χ + ¯χ → visible matter

whose evaluation requires, of course, the precise knowledge of the production mechanism, so far unknown. The excess
of gamma rays at the galactic center is, for example, a possible signal of a dark matter annihilation process [4], and
other eﬀects [5] might be understood as a manifestation of some relevant nonperturbative mechanism presumably not
taken into account until now.

In this letter we would like to explore a model in which the dark sector contains a non-abelian ﬁeld theory ad-
mitting massive topologically stable classical solutions: monopoles which weakly interact with ordinary ﬁelds. These
conﬁgurations are characterized by a topological charge, an additive magnitude which can take both signs in such a
way that two such solutions can be smoothly merged into a single object with the sum of their topological charges.
We will assume that it is energetically favorable to have conﬁguration with the same topological charge sign separated
far away. Then, we can consider a dilute gas of monopoles of unit topological charge (of both signs), neutral in the
mean, created at a very energetic event in the past.

Under these conditions, the most relevant interaction for such objects would be the annihilation of a monopole
(charge +1) with an anti-monopole (charge -1), producing a non-topological object and emitting their energy in the
form of dark and ordinary particles. Being very massive, these objects could also be gravitationally attracted by
the galaxies, enhancing the probability of such annihilation process in their immediacies. If the result includes the
emission of normal photons, this scheme would ﬁt in the excess of luminosity of galaxies centers [4].

There is also a simple experimental example which provides an analogy of the aforementioned scenario. Indeed, in
a ripple tank with two vortices produced in the water with opposite sense of rotation, the collision between these two
topological defects produces a disturbance in water in the form of waves whose amplitude will depend on the vortex
energies [6, 7], in virtue of the energy and angular momentum conservation.

Our discussion is based on a simple application of the Georgi-Glashow model [8] for the dark sector with a suitable
gauge-invariant kinetic mixing term between the nonabelian (dark) ﬁelds and the usual electromagnetic ﬁeld. The
coupling between both sectors is realized by adding to the Lagrangian a term proportional to the electromagnetic
strength tensor times the gauge-invariant ’t Hooft tensor [9–11].

In order to establish our notation, let us start by describing the Lagrangian of the Georgi-Glashow model, an SU (2)

nonabelian gauge theory with a triplet of scalar ﬁelds in the adjoint representation,

LGG = −

(Dµ[X]φ)a(Dµ[X]φ)a − V (φaφa),

(1)

where an implicit summation over a, b, ... = 1, 2, 3 is understood each time an index is repeated in a term. Here, the
covariant derivative of the scalars in the adjoint representation is given by

where Xa,µ is the (nonabelian) gauge ﬁeld and the strength tensor is given by

(Dµφ)a = ∂µφa + q ǫabcXb,νφc.

Ga,µν (X) = ∂µXa,ν − ∂νXa,µ + q ǫabcXb,µXc,ν,

(2)

(3)

where ǫabc is completely antisymmetric with ǫ123 = 1.

Notice that both the strength tensor and the triplet of scalars can be represented as elements in the Lie algebra of

SU (2) as

Gµν = Ga,µν Ta , Φ = φaTa ,

where Ta = σa
gauge transformation U (x) ∈ SU (2) these elements transform as

spontaneously broken to U (1). We also adopt the temporal gauge, Xa,0 = 0.

We will assume that the potential V (φaφa) ≥ 0 has its absolute minima at φaφa = v2. Then, the symmetry is
We will be interested in background nontrivial static conﬁgurations of ﬁnite energy, condition which requires that
the scalar ﬁelds tend to a minimum of the potential suﬃciently fast for x2 = r2 → ∞. Since the potential minima
belong to a 2-sphere (of radius v), S 2
∞ = ∂R3 onto S 2
v ,
which is characterized by the winding number, the (integer) number of times the application involves the sphere of
minima S 2
’t Hooft [9] and Polyakov [10] have shown that
there exist such static and ﬁnite energy solutions with nontrivial winding number, which are stable as a consequence
of their topology.

v , the scalar ﬁeld at inﬁnity establishes an application of S 2

v , with a sign determined by the sense of this covering.

’t Hooft [9] has also constructed a gauge invariant tensor given by

Gµν = 2 tr(cid:26)Gµν ˆΦ +

q hDµ ˆΦ, Dν ˆΦi ˆΦ(cid:27) =

ǫabc ˆφa (Dµ ˆφ)b (Dν ˆφ)c,

(6)

where ˆΦ = ˆφaTa, with ˆφa = φa/√φbφb. Notice that Gµν has dimension of (mass)2. This tensor can be brought to
coincide with G3,µν, for example, in any bounded region of R3 through a suitable (smooth) gauge transformation,
without changing the winding number. These considerations justify the interpretation of Bi := 1
2 ǫijkGjk as the
magnetic ﬁeld associated with the unbroken U (1) symmetry [11], and

g :=

as the magnetic charge of the topological conﬁguration of this nonabelian ﬁeld.

So deﬁned, g is a topological invariant [9–11] which equals the winding number divided by the constant q [12],
g = n/q. Moreover, since it is a surface integral, g is an additive quantity for well separated topological conﬁgurations,
and its value remains invariant when these conﬁgurations are smoothly brought together. In this sense, these classical
conﬁgurations of the nonabelian theory are monopoles of magnetic charge quantized in units of q−1.

The static solution with n = ±1 is the ’t Hooft-Polyakov monopole [9, 10], a regular conﬁguration free of the Dirac
singularities present in the description of monopoles in an Abelian gauge theory. These are massive conﬁgurations
which minimize the energy functional given by

E[X, Φ] = ZR3 (cid:26) 1

The numerical solution of the variational problem for these minima [13] shows that there is a core of radius
−1 = 1/qv outside which the massive gauge bosons (of mass MX = qv) rapidly approach their asymptotic
Rc ≈ MX
−1 = 1/v√λ
value, while the scalar ﬁeld approaches its asymptotic value outside a region of dimension RH = MH
(where MH = v√λ is the scalar (Higgs) mass), less than Rc for suﬃciently large λ. The main contributions to the
energy come from the magnetic ﬁeld B outside the core and from the gradient of the scalar ﬁeld inside it. ’t Hooft
has shown [9, 13] that the monopole mass is

Mmon =

4πv

f (λ/q2) =

4π
q2 MX f (λ/q2) ,

(9)

where f (x) is an O(1) monotonically increasing function [13], 1 ≤ f (x) < 2 for x ∈ R+.

After this brief description of known results about one of the most relevant non-perturbative developments obtained
in the seventies, we proceed to employ this nonabelian gauge theory as a model for a dark matter sector, which we
put in interaction with the visible Maxwell electromagnetic ﬁeld Aµ by adding to the Lagrangian a (gauge invariant)
dual kinetic mixing term [14]

Here γ is a dimensionless constant, Fµν (A) is the strength tensor of the electromagnetic ﬁeld and the dual strength
tensor of the nonabelian ﬁeld is ˜Gµν (X) = 1

2 ǫµνρσGρσ(X), with Gµν (X) deﬁned in (6).

L1 = γ Fµν (A) ˜Gµν (X).

(10)

It would be noticed that this coupling between the dark sector and the electromagnetic ﬁeld breaks the CP-symmetry
but, as we will see, it also gives rise to the possibility of having massive milli-charged objects whose detection would
be an indication in favor of this model. In fact, an independent argument of indirect CP-violation in the dark sector
has been recently proposed in [15].

Our Lagrangian is then

(11)

where we will assume that the visible and dark sectors are weakly coupled (γ ≪ 1).
It is worth to remark that in [16] a similar model of dark monopoles in interaction with the visible sector has been
considered. In that article, the interaction does not break parity and, as a consequence, the monopoles are not a
source for the electromagnetic ﬁeld. In the following we will show that the coupling we propose in (10) makes the
monopoles to appear as massive charged objects, which eﬀectively are sources for the visible electromagnetic ﬁeld [17].

Indeed, the Euler-Lagrange equations for the electromagnetic ﬁeld derived from Ec. (11) are

∂µ

∂L

∂ (∂µAν)

= ∂µn−F µν + 2γ ˜Gµνo = 0 ,

which implies that the content of electric charge of the topological conﬁguration in Eq. (6) is

Qmon = ZR3

∂iF i0 d3x = γǫi0jkZR3

∂iGjk d3x = 2γI∂R3 Bi dSi = 16πγg =

16πγ

q

n .

(12)

(13)

Therefore, these monopoles also carry an electric charge proportional to the winding number, quantized in units of
16πγ/q.

The next step is to physically interpret the model, in which we are essentially assuming that the electromagnetic ﬁeld
is weakly coupled to the nonabelian sector (γ << 1) and the monopoles are very massive background conﬁgurations,
which requires that q < 1 (See Eq. (9)). On the other hand, the monopole electric charge in Eq. (13) must be small in
order they remain dark to the electromagnetic interaction; then, 0 < γ << q < 1. Taking into account the additivity
of the magnetic charge, we have also assumed that it is energetically favorable to have monopoles of winding number
±1.
These monopoles are topologically stable classical conﬁgurations which cannot individually decay through the
emission of dark or visible particles, since these processes do not change their winding number. Its decay can only
occurs when a pair monopole - antimonopole meet each other and, due to the additivity of the magnetic charge, they
merge into an electrically neutral conﬁguration with vanishing winding number. In this case, an energy equal to twice
the monopole mass can be emitted as visible and dark particles. This possibility presents as an interesting route to
explore in the context of the observed photon excess at the center of the galaxy [4].

The precise mechanism of annihilation of dark matter still remains unknown, but the possibility that it decays in
cascades until ﬁnally reaching a pair of particle-antiparticle of the standard model is an interesting prospect to explore
in order to get some numerical bounds. In this context, it would be worth to consider the model previously discussed.
As previously mentioned, the CP-breaking kinetic mixing approach in Eq. (10) for the interaction between the
Maxwell ﬁeld and a nonabelian SU (2) gauge theory for the dark sector leads to the appearance of ’t Hooft - Polyakov
monopoles in the dark sector which, additionally to their (nonabelian) mgnetic charge, present in the visible sector
as millicharged massive particles, whose detection would give support for this proposal [18].
