We investigate superconductivity in a two-band system with an electron- and hole-like band,
where one of the bands is away from the Fermi level (or “incipient”). We argue that the incipient
band contributes signiﬁcantly to spin-ﬂuctuation pairing in the strong coupling limit where the
system is close to a magnetic instability, and can lead to a large Tc. In this case, Tc is limited by
a competition between the frequency range of the coupling (set by an isolated paramagnon) and
the coupling strength itself, such that a dome-like Tc dependence on the incipient band position
is obtained. The coupling of electrons to phonons is found to further enhance Tc. The results are
discussed in the context of experiments on monolayers and intercalates of FeSe.

Introduction — Iron based superconductors (FeSC)
form the largest family of unconventional superconduc-
tors (SC) known to us. This includes the stoichiometric,
pressurized, doped and/or intercalated versions of quasi-
2D layered Fe-pnictogen or Fe-chalcogen compounds of
the 1111, 111, 122, and 11 families. These systems col-
lectively host a variety of superconducting phases and
exhibit a broad range Tc’s [1–4], which still lack a consis-
tent explanation. Among these, the FeSe systems present
a curious phenomenology: almost all members related to
this family –alkali/alkali-hydroxy intercalated FeSe [5–7],
ammonia intercalated FeSe [8–11]– exhibit Tc ∼ 35−45 K
and even reaching 60− 70 K in the case of single unit cell
(UC) thick FeSe grown on 001-SrTiO3 (STO) [12–15],
110-STO, and [16, 17] 001-BaTiO3 (BTO) [18]. Even
bulk FeSe, which has a Tc of only 8 K [19], exhibits a
maximum Tc of 36 K [20] under pressure.

Thus far, the relatively high Tc’s in these systems
have been correlated with an increase of the ab-plane
lattice constant in multi UC FeSe ﬁlms [21, 22] or an
increase in the c-axis lattice constant in the interca-
lates [22]. The evolution from single- to multi-UC ﬁlms
is not smooth [23], but the general trend is that Tc is
suppressed when more layers are added. Another corre-
lation, particular to the 1 UC FeSe on STO (and BTO),
is based on the observation of ‘replica’ bands ∼ 100 meV
below the electron and hole bands [15]. This is indicative
of a strong forward-focussed (q = 0) electron-phonon (e-
ph) coupling to a polar phonon mode of the doped STO
substrate, which was recently invoked to explain the high
Tc of the interfaces [15, 24–26].

This, however, does not explain the relatively high Tc
in the other FeSe systems without STO phonons, nor why
electron doping the FeSC and removing the hole Fermi
pockets seems generally to enhance Tc [2, 27]. This em-
pirical trend also appears to directly contradict the spin
ﬂuctuation pairing scenario for FeSC, where the pair scat-
tering by repulsive interactions between hole and electron
Fermi pockets (separated by Q) leads to strong pairing;

naively, removing the hole pocket should destroy this in-
teraction and suppress Tc rapidly.
Indeed, while a re-
cent work on incipient band pairing showed that if pair-
ing exists making use of electronic states at the Fermi
level, superconductivity can also be induced in incipi-
ent bands [28], the authors also found that moving the
hole band away from the Fermi level always suppresses
Tc within the weak coupling framework.

We address these issues in this Letter by noting that
an interesting, and often overlooked, clue lies in the
electronic structure of FeSe systems. Although all the
FeSe systems have electron-like Fermi pockets at the
M−points, another common aspect is that they have
an incipient hole band 50 − 100 meV below the Fermi
level [5, 12–15]. This incipient hole band, neglected in
nearly all analyses of SC pairing, is shown here to play a
crucial role in the strong coupling regime.

Since the FeSe systems are generally tetragonal and
quasi-2D, it suﬃces to consider a rather simple model
of their electronic structure. Here, we adopt a two
band system with a regular electron band and incipi-
ent hole band. We then solve Eliashberg-type equations
in which the pairing glue is provided by the interband
spin-ﬂuctuations (SF), considered in the strong coupling
regime close to a magnetic instability. We argue that
the FeSe systems are able to sustain stronger electronic
correlations without developing magnetic long range or-
der due to the suppression of interband scattering by the
incipient electronic states.

The proximity to magnetism is well established in these
systems. In fact, the interpretation of the data in Refs.
[21] and [27] suggests that FeSe ﬁlm thickness as low as
3 UC on STO results in a hole band crossing the fermi
level, which is accompanied by spectral features associ-
ated with a magnetic state, while a large Tc is recovered
in such thicker ﬁlms by electron doping [27]. Further, a
ﬁrst principles study [29] of 1 UC FeSe/STO found that
FeSe would have a very strong spin-density wave (SDW)
without the substrate induced electron doping, again sug-

Here, f is the Fermi function and U > 0 is a repulsive
point-contact interaction parameter that has the same
scale as those in Hubbard-Hund type models [31, 32].
Note that we are discarding the remaining charge and
spin susceptibilties that arise in the FLEX formalism.
We therefore expect to overestimate Tc in this approach.
In the weak coupling limit (u ≡ m∗
e +
h) (cid:28) 1), for the incipient case (Eh < 0), the propa-
m∗
gator V SF is nonsingular and can be treated as a con-
stant [28]. For u ∼ 1, however, the system hosts a sharp
paramagnon peak (a pole at Ω = Ωp in the retarded V SF
) controlled by Eh. (see Fig. 1). The position of this
peak determines not only the size of the electron-SF cou-
pling but also the ‘pairing bandwidth’ ΛSF over which the
pairing interaction acts.

An estimate for Tc — Before we analyze the solutions
to the Eliashberg equations we oﬀer a qualitative picture
of the interplay between the coupling and the pairing
bandwidth ΛSF. To proceed, we focus on q = Q; it will
be shown later that for the incipient case (Eh < 0), the q
dependence of V SF near Q is relatively weak. Then, for
Eh < 0, ΛB (cid:29) Eh,e and T = 0, we obtain

gesting strong correlations in the system.

Accounting for the close proximity to magnetic order
and strong correlations allowed for by the incipient band,
we ﬁnd that the pairing is dominated by a sharp param-
agnon peak in the SF propagator at an energy Ωp that
is induced near energies corresponding to the onset of
interband transitions. Due to the electronic origin of
the bosonic peak, its position controls both the pairing
bandwidth and the coupling strength (unlike a phonon
mechanism where the two are largely independent). As
the peak hardens, the interplay between the above two
quantities results in a non-monotonic behavior of Tc. In-
troducing an additional e-ph coupling further enhances
Tc, as was pointed out in Ref. [28]. We now present the
systematics of our result.

If the coupling constant diverges, it is tempting to con-
clude that Tc → ∞ within Eliashberg theory. However,
we have demonstrated that even within an Eliashberg
type theory, the Tc remains ﬁnite. This is a hallmark
of a strong coupling electronic mechanism for supercon-
ductivity. The schematic evolution of Tc with Eh based
on these considerations is presented in Fig. 2b. The
suppression of Tc near E∗
h is a consequence of the dy-
namics of the pairing interaction, which leads to a strong
mass renormalization of quasiparticles in the Fermi-liquid
state. This aspect is not present in conventional e-ph the-
ories because the coupling and the boson frequency are
usually decoupled.

Incipient Eliashberg equations — To accurately de-
scribe the region close to the instability E∗
h , we need to
turn to a description in terms of the Eliashberg equations.
These can be greatly simpliﬁed if the eﬀective interaction
V SF does not depend strongly on momentum transfer q.
In Fig. 3 we investigate this dependence around Q, deﬁn-
ing ˜q = Q + q. The Stoner-like enhancement leads to a

strong variation of V SF(q, iνn = 0) close to the instability,
as can be seen in Figs. 3a) - 3c). In Fig. 3d), 3e) and 3f)
we show V SF(q, 0) as a function of Eh and the momentum
deviation q for the interaction parameters U = 0.4, 0.45,
and 0.51 eV, respectively. The regions shown in green
are beyond the instability and correspond to a magnetic
ground state. Thus, in Fig. 3c), the magnetic instability
occurs at a ﬁnite q leading to an incommensurate SDW
ground state. As is evident in Fig. 3, the momentum de-
pendence is only important very close to the instability
and is rather featureless when the hole band goes deeper
below the Fermi level; we conclude that the momentum
dependence can be neglected in the Eliashberg equations
in this region of parameter space.

For the following numerical solution, we choose exper-

h = 1.6me, m∗
e = 2.6me, lattice constant a = 3.9 Å, and
Ee = −60 meV. In Fig. 4, we show the results from the
numerical solution to the Eliashberg equations. Figure
4a), shows the gap value ∆(iπT ) as a function of tem-
perature and electron doping (Eh). For the given band-
width ΛB = 900 meV, we observe a maximum Tc at about
h = −78
the experimental position of the hole band (E exp
meV [35]) if we assume a reasonable interaction parame-
ter of U = 0.7 eV.

In the panels 4d) and 4e), we show the temperature and
doping dependence of the two s± gaps, respectively. Note
that the interband nature of the interaction makes the in-
cipient hole gap larger than the electron band gap. This
explains the counterintuitive trend in Fig. 4d) whereby
the electron band gap is suppressed faster by continued
electron doping while the hole band gap reaches its max-
imum at lower Eh.

In Fig. 4f), we plot the gap/ critical temperature ra-
tio. For Eh far away from the instability, we ﬁnd the BCS
value of 3.5 for 2∆e/Tc, which increases as Eh moves to-
wards the Fermi level to much larger values of about 9,
reﬂecting the the strong coupling behavior near the mag-
netic instability. 2∆h/Tc has a similar enhanced behavior

close to the instability, but is also much larger than the
electron band ratio far from the instability, as discussed
in Ref. 28.

The overestimation of Tc — Our model produces pos-
sible Tc values well above 200 K. Note, however, that
we have neglected the intra-band component of the re-
spulsive interactions that will reduce this estimate. This
is typically captured by the standard µ∗ approximation;
however, while one can easily show that an analogous
RPA treatement leads to a Coulomb repulsion screened
by the electron-band charge suscepbility, the use of the
standard µ∗ approximation is questionable due to the
shallowness of the electron band. A more accurate calcu-
lation of this contribution requires momentum resolution,
which would increase the complexity of our model. Thus,
we leave this for future work. Finally, Tc is also likely to
be suppressed in the real system due to increased ﬂuc-
tations in 2D that are not captured by the Eliashberg
formalism.

Role of phonons — Since the momentum dependence
of the interactions is neglected here, we cannot account
for the forward scattering nature of the e-ph interaction
in the 1UC FeSe/STO. We note, however, that it will
lead to a purely intraband phonon coupling.
In this
spirit, we add in Fig. 4b) an intra-band phonon inter-
action of with total coupling λph = 0.6, Ωph = 100 meV,
δi,i(cid:48)δ(Ω − Ωph), which increases
and α2Fi,i(cid:48)(Ω) = λphΩph
to 250 K at the optimal Eh and makes superconduc-
T max
tivity persist to much lower Eh. We also note that the Tc

2

c

increase due to the phonons will likely be larger in a more
accurate treatment of the forward scattering and/or the
intraband replusion. In the latter case there will a can-
cellation of the replusive intraband interaction, that will
make the inﬂuence of the attractive phonon interaction
more prominent.

Conclusions — We have shown that when a magnetic
instability nearly coincides with a band moving below
the Fermi level, this so-called incipient band can play
an important role in pairing. Within a simple two-band
model, Tc in such a system was found to have a dome-
like behavior due to the competition between the cou-
pling strength and spin ﬂuctuation bandwidth. Both of
these are controlled by the paramagnon peak in the SF
spectrum, which is present for systems with strong corre-
lations (u ∼ 1). For weakly correlated systems (u (cid:28) 1),
there is no such peak and one recovers the results of Ref
[28]. With realistic values for the parameters, we ﬁnd sig-
niﬁcant optimal values of Tc, even in the absence of Fermi
surface-based interactions. In particular, for values rele-
vant for FeSe/STO (we expect those of the interaclates to
be similar), we ﬁnd that the maximum Tc is clearly capa-
ble of explaining the high critical temperatures observed
in these systems.
Including an additional phonon cou-
pling in the energy range of the suspected oxygen modes
of STO observed in Ref. [15] further enhances the critical
temperature.
