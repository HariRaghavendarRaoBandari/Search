A SELECTION THEOREM FOR BANACH BUNDLES AND

APPLICATIONS

ALDO J. LAZAR

Abstract. It is shown that certain lower semi-continuous maps from a para-
compact space to the family of closed subsets of the bundle space of a Banach
bundle admit continuous selections. This generalization of the the theorem of
Douady, dal Soglio-Herault, and Hofmann on the fullness of Banach bundles
has applications to establishing conditions under which the induced maps be-
tween the spaces of sections of Banach bundles are onto. Another application
is to a generalization of the theorem of Bartle and Graves [3] for Banach bundle
maps that are onto their images. Other applications of the selection theorem
are to the study of the M-ideals of the space of bounded sections begun in [8].
A class of Banach bundles that generalizes the class of trivial Banach bundles
is introduced and some properties of these Banach bundles are discussed.

1. Introduction and basic definitions and notations

The theory of Banach bundles, sometimes presented as continuous ﬁelds of Ba-

nach spaces, helped to advance the study of unitary representations of locally com-

pact groups and of C∗-algebras. An early example of its usefulness and interest in

these ﬁelds can be found in [6] and for later developments we mention [7]. Other

beneﬁcial connections of this theory are with the theory of Banach lattices. A short

exposition on this aspect is given in the comprehensive monograph of Gierz [8] and

more recent results appeared in [11]. The theory of Banach bundles provides an

association of topology, the geometry of Banach spaces and operator theory, as

exempliﬁed in [8, Chapters 15 and 16] and [12].

We prove in this paper a generalization of Michael’s well known selection theo-

rem, [16, Theorem 3.2”], in the context of Banach bundles. This result, Theorem

2.9, also generalizes the theorems of Douady, L. dal Soglio-Herault, and K. H. Hof-

mann, see [7, Appendix C], on the existence of suﬃciently many continuous cross-

sections in a Banach bundle. A particular case of Theorem 2.9 is [8, Proposition

15.13].

In Section 3 we consider Banach bundle maps (deﬁnition will follow) and the

induced maps between the spaces of sections. We apply the selection theorem to

establishing some conditions under which these later maps are onto their images.

This investigation led to examining when a map between two Banach bundles is

open. The section ends with the generalization of a theorem of Bartle and Graves

on the existence of continuous right inverses for maps between Banach spaces. Here

the context is of course maps between Banach bundles and we follow Michael [16]

in using the selection theorem for deriving the existence of such an inverse.

Alfsen and Eﬀros developed in [1] a structure theory for Banach spaces in which

certain subspaces named M-ideals play a crucial role. The M-ideals of the Banach

space of sections of a Banach bundle whose base space is compact Hausdorﬀ were

investigated in depth by Gierz [8]. In Section 4 we extend this investigation to the

case when the base space is locally compact Hausdorﬀ and the sections vanish at

inﬁnity.

A certain class of continuous Banach bundles is introduced in Section 5; the

bundles in this class are called locally uniform. Every locally trivial Banach bundle

A SELECTION THEOREM FOR BANACH BUNDLES AND APPLICATIONS

3

is locally uniform but the converse is false. The locally uniform Banach bundles

enjoy some nice properties. For instance we show in Proposition 5.7 that the quo-

tient of a locally uniform Banach bundle by a locally uniform Banach subbundle is

a continuous Banach bundle.

Some topological properties of the bundle space are treated in the Appendix.

Conditions which insure that the bundle space is a Baire space are given. Also its

paracompactness and its metrizability are discussed there.

Throughout of this paper the ﬁeld of scalars is denoted by K; it can be the ﬁeld

of the real numbers or the ﬁeld of the complex numbers. A paracompact space

is always considered to be Hausdorﬀ. A topological space is locally paracompact

if it has a cover with open subsets whose closures are paracompact. A map Φ

from a topological space T1 to the family of subsets of a topological space T2 is

called lower semi-continuous if for every open non-void subset O of T2 the set

{t ∈ T1 | O ∩ Φ(t) 6= ∅} is open in T1.

For a Banach space X, x ∈ X, and r a positive number we denote B(x, r) :=

{y ∈ X | ky − xk < r} and by Xr the closed ball of X whose center is at the

origin with radius r. A closed subspace Y of the Banach space X is called an

M-ideal of X if its polar Z1 in the dual of X has a closed complement Z2 such

that kz1 + z2k = kz1k + kz2k for every zi ∈ Zi, i = 1, 2. A closed subspace Y of

X is an M-ideal if and only if ithas the 3-ball property: if ∩3

i=1B(xi, ri) 6= ∅ and

B(xi, ri) ∩ Y 6= ∅, 1 ≤ i ≤ 3, then Y ∩ ∩3

i=1B(xi, ri) 6= ∅.

By a Banach bundle ξ := (E, p, T ) we shall mean what in [4, pp. 8,9] is called an

(H)Banach bundle. That is x → kxk is upper semi-continuous on the bundle space

E, see also [8, p.21]. We shall always suppose that the base space T is Hausdorﬀ.

The ﬁber p−1(t) over t ∈ T will be sometimes denoted E(t). The origin of the

Banach space E(t) is denoted 0t but if there can be no confusion just 0 will be

used. The bundle ξ is called a continuous Banach bundle if x → kxk is continuous

on E. The bundle space of a continuous Banach bundle is always Hausdorﬀ, see

[8, Proposition 16.4]. If E ′ is a subset of E such that p |E ′ is onto T and open and
each p−1(t) ∩ E ′ is a closed subspace of E(t) then ξ′ := (E ′, p |E ′ , T ) is a Banach

bundle called a Banach subbundle of ξ. One can deﬁne an equivalence relation

on E as follows: x1, x2 are equivalent if p(x1) = p(x2) and x1 − x2 belongs to

4

ALDO J. LAZAR

p−1(p(x1)). The quotient space, denoted E/E ′, is the union of all the quotient
Banach spaces E(t)/E ′(t), t ∈ T . If we denote by ˜p the obvious map of E/E ′ onto

T then η := (E/E ′, ˜p, T ) is a Banach bundle by [8, Chapter 9]. The quotient map

q : E → E/E ′ is open, see [8, 9.4].

Let ξ := (E, p, T ) be a Banach bundle. A continuous function f : T → E is called

a section of ξ if p(f (t)) = t for every t ∈ T . The linear space of all the sections of ξ

is denoted Γ(ξ); its subspace of all the bounded sections is denoted Γb(ξ). This is

a Banach space, the norm of f ∈ Γb(ξ) being kf k := supt∈T kf (t)k. If T is locally

compact Hausdorﬀ then the subspace Γ0(ξ) of Γb(ξ) consisting of all the sections

that vanish at inﬁnity is of interest.

A full Banach bundle is a bundle such that for each x ∈ E there exists a section

f ∈ Γ(ξ) satisfying f (p(x)) = x. In this deﬁnition one can replace Γ(ξ) by Γb(ξ) as

observed in [4, p. 14] and even by Γ0(ξ) if T is locally compact. For f ∈ Γ(ξ), V

an open subset of T , and a > 0 the open subset

U (f, V, a) := {x ∈ E | p(x) ∈ V, kx − f (p(x))k < a}

of E is called a tube. If ξ is a full Banach bundle then the family of all the tubes

forms a base for the topology of E by [4, p. 10].

A Banach bundle map from ξ1 := (E1, p1, T ) to ξ2 := (E2, p2, T ) is a continuous

map ϕ : E1 → E2 such that ϕ(p−1
of ϕ to each ﬁber p−1

2 (t) for every t ∈ T and the restriction
1 (t) is linear. The map ϕ is called an (isometric) isomorphism

1 (t)) ⊂ p−1

if ϕ(E1) = E2 and ϕ is an isometry on every ﬁber.

2. The selection theorem

In this section we shall state and prove the selection theorem for set valued

maps into a Banach bundle and we shall discuss some of its applications. The

proof mimics closely the proofs given in [7, Appendix C] and [16]. A sequence of

lemmas prepares the proof of the theorem itself.

From now on in this section ξ := (E, p, T ) is a ﬁxed Banach bundle. Following

[7, Appendix C] we shall say that a subset U of E is ε-thin, ε > 0, if kx − x′k < ε

whenever x, x′ ∈ E and p(x) = p(x′).

Lemma 2.1. Let t ∈ T , x1, x2 ∈ p−1(t) with kx1 − x2k < ε. There is an open

ε-thin set U that contains the segment [x1, x2].

A SELECTION THEOREM FOR BANACH BUNDLES AND APPLICATIONS

5

Proof. With D := {(x, y) ∈ E × E | p(x) = p(y)}, the set {(x, y) | kx − yk < ε} is

open since (x, y) → kx − yk is upper semi-continuous. There is an open subset O

of E × E such that

[x1, x2] × [x1, x2] ⊂ {(x, y) | kx − yk} = O ∩ D.

By [17, p. 171] there is an open set U ⊂ E such that

[x1, x2] × [x1, x2] ⊂ U × U ⊂ O.

Obviously U is ε-thin.

(cid:3)

We enlarge now our setting with a completely regular topological space S and

a continuous open map π of S onto T . A function f : S → E is called admissible

if p ◦ f = π. Let ε > 0. A function f : S → E is called ε-continuous at s ∈ S

if there are a neighbourhood V of s and an ε-thin neighbourhood U of f (s) such

that f (V ) ⊂ U . If f is ε-continuous at all the points of S then it is called shortly

ε-continuous.

Lemma 2.2. If an admissible function f is ε-continuous for all ε > 0 then it is

continuous.

Proof. Let s ∈ S and and suppose that Vn is a neighbourhood of s and Un is

an 1/n-thin neighbourhood of f (s), with f (Vn) ⊂ Un, n ∈ N. We have f (Vn ∩

Vn+1) ⊂ Un ∩ Un+1 so there is no loss of generality if we suppose that {Un} is

decreasing. Let now W be a neighbourhood of f (s). By [4, p. 10] there are a

natural number n and a neighbourhood V of π(s) such that Un ∩ p−1(V ) ⊂ W .
The neighbourhood V ∩ π(Vn) of p(f (s)) = π(s) satisﬁes Un ∩ p−1(V ∩ π(Vn)) ⊂ W .
The neighbourhood Vn ∩ π−1(V ) os s satisﬁes f (Vn ∩ π−1(V )) ⊂ W . Indeed, if
s′ ∈ Vn ∩ π−1(V ) ⊂ Vn then f (s′) ∈ Un. Moreover, p(f (s−1)) = π(s′) ∈ π(Vn) ∩ V ;
hence f (s′) ∈ p−1(π(Vn) ∩ V ) ⊂ p−1(V ). Thus f (s′) ∈ Un ∩ p−1(V ) ⊂ W and the

continuity of f at s is established.

(cid:3)

Lemma 2.3. Let G be an open subset of S and {Ui}n
that p(Ui) = π(G), 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Suppose that {ϕi}n

i=1 be open subsets of E such

i=1 are continuous scalar functions

6

ALDO J. LAZAR

on G with ϕ1(s) 6= 0 for each s ∈ G. Then the set

W := {X ϕi(s)xi | s ∈ G, xi ∈ Ui, p(xi) = π(s), 1 ≤ i ≤ n}

is open in E.

Proof. Consider the set

Z := {(s, x1 . . . , xn) | s ∈ G, xi ∈ E, p(xi) = π(s), 1 ≤ i ≤ n}

endowed with the relative topology inherited from G × p−1(π(G))n. A basis for

this topology consists of all the sets of the form O := (V × V1 × . . . Vn) ∩ Z where
V ⊂ G, Vi ⊂ p−1(π(G)), 1 ≤ i ≤ n, are open. Thus

(1)

O := {(s, x1, . . . xn) | s ∈ V, xi ∈ Vi, p(xi) = π(s), 1 ≤ i ≤ n}.

is a homeomorphism.

Indeed it is continuous and its inverse maps (s, y1, . . . yn)

The map α of Z onto itself given by α(s, x1, . . . xn) := (s,P ϕi(s)xi, x2, . . . xn)
to (s, 1/ϕ1(s)(y1 − Pn

i=2 ϕi(s)yi), y2, . . . yn). The map β of Z into E given by

β(s, x1, . . . xn) := x1 is open. Indeed, if O is as in (1) then

β(O) = V1 ∩ p−1(π(V ) ∩ ∩n

i=1p(Vi))

that is open. Now W = β(α((G × U1, . . . Un) ∩ Z)) is obviously open.

(cid:3)

Lemma 2.4. Suppose ϕi, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, are continuous functions from S to [0, 1] with

P ϕi = 1. Let ε > 0. If fi, 1 ≤ i ≤ n are admissible and ε-continuous at s0 ∈ S
then f :=P ϕifi is admissible and ε-continuous at s0.

Proof. We have to prove only that f is ε-continuous at s0. There is no loss of

generality if we suppose ϕ1(s0) 6= 0. There exist ε-thin open neighbourhoods Ui

of fi(s0) and open neighbourhoods Vi of s0 such that fi(Vi) ⊂ Ui, 1 ≤ i ≤ n. By

taking ∩n

i=1Vi and further reducing it if needed one gets an open neighbourhood V

of s0 such that fi(V ) ⊂ Ui, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and ϕ(s) > 0 if s ∈ V . From fi(V ) ⊂ Ui and
the admissibility of fi we get fi(V ) ⊂ p−1(π(V ))∩Ui and p(p−1(π(V ))∩Ui) = π(V ),
1 ≤ i ≤ n. The set p−1(π(V )) ∩ Ui is an open neighbourhood of fi(s0). The set

W := {X ϕi(s)xi | s ∈ V, xi ∈ p−1(π(V )) ∩ Ui, p(xi) = π(s), 1 ≤ i ≤ n}

is open in E by Lemma 2.3 and f (s0) ∈ W . By the above f (V ) ⊂ W and it remains

to show that W is ε-thin. To this end, let x′, x′′ ∈ W with p(x′) = p(x′′) = π(s) for

some s ∈ V . Then x′ =P ϕi(s)x′

i ∈ Ui, p(x′′

with x′′

i) = π(s) and x′′ =P ϕi(s)x′′

i ∈ Ui, p(x′

i with x′

conclude that W is ε-thin.

(cid:3)

Lemma 2.5. Let x0 ∈ E, s0 ∈ S with π(s0) = p(x0). There exists an ε-continuous

admissible function f : S → E such that f (s0) = x0.

Proof. Let U be an ε-thin open neighbourhood of x0 and set V := π−1(p(U )) which

is an open neighbourhood of s0. Deﬁne g : V → E so that g(s0) = x0 and g(s) ∈ U

with p(g(s)) = π(s) for s ∈ V . Let W be an open neighbourhood of s0 such

that W ⊂ V and ϕ : S → [0, 1] a continuous function such that ϕ(s0) = 1 and

ϕ |S\W ≡ 0. Set

(2)

f (s) :=(ϕ(s)g(s),

0,

if s ∈ V ,
if s /∈ V .

Then on V , f = ϕg + (1 − ϕ)0. Thus f is ε-continuous on V by Lemma 2.4 and

trivially ε-continuous on S \ W . Clearly f is an admissible function.

(cid:3)

From here on, until the end of the proof of Theorem 2.9, S is a paracompact

space and Φ is a lower semi-continuous map from S to the family of non-void closed

subsets of E such that Φ(s) is a convex subset of p−1(π(s)) for every s ∈ S.

Lemma 2.6. Given s0 ∈ S and ε > 0 there are an ε-continuous admissible function

f and a neighbourhood V of s0 such that B(f (s), ε) ∩ Φ(s) 6= ∅ for every s ∈ S.

Proof. Let x0 ∈ Φ(s0) and f be an ε-continuous admissible function such that

f (s0) = x0 as given by Lemma 2.5. There are an ε-thin neighbourhood U of x0 and

a neighbourhood V1 of s0 such that f (V1) ⊂ U . The set V2 := {s ∈ S | U ∩Φ(s) 6= ∅}

is an open neighbourhood of s0. Set V := V1 ∩ V2. Then, for each s ∈ V there is

x ∈ U ∩ Φ(s) and kf (s) − xk < ε since f (s) ∈ U and U is an ε-thin set.

(cid:3)

Now we have reached the main approximation lemma. Its statement consists of

two assertions with similar proofs.

Lemma 2.7. Let ε > 0.

8

ALDO J. LAZAR

(i) There

is

an

ε-continuous

admissible

function

g

such

that

B(g(s), ε) ∩ Φ(s) 6= ∅ for every s ∈ S.

(ii) Given an ε-continuous admissible function f such that B(f (s), ε)∩Φ(s) 6= ∅

for every s ∈ S there is an ε/2-continuous admissible function g such that

kf (s) − g(s)k < 2ε and B(g(s), ε/2) ∩ Φ(s) 6= ∅ for every s ∈ S.

Proof. We begin with the proof of (ii). Given f as above, the ﬁrst step of the

proof is to show that for every s ∈ S there are an open neighbourhood V and

an ε/2-continuous admissible function h such that B(h(s′), ε/2) ∩ Φ(s′) 6= ∅ and

kf (s′) − h(s′)k < 2ε for each s′ ∈ V . Let s ∈ S and choose x ∈ B(f (s), ε) ∩ Φ(s).

There is an ε-thin open neighbourhood U1 of f (s) and an open neighbourhood V1

of s such that f (V1) ⊂ U1. Let y = 3/4x + 1/4f (s). Lemma 2.5 yields an ε/4-

continuous admissible function h such that h(s) = y. We are going to show that h

satisﬁes our claim.

There are an ε/4-thin open neighbourhood U2 of y and an open neighbourhood

V2 of s such that h(V2) ⊂ U2. By using Lemma 2.1 we get an ε/4-thin open set

U3 that contains the segment [y, x] and an open 3ε/4-thin set U4 that contains the
segment [y, f (s)]. Denote V ′ := {s′ | U3 ∩ Φ(s′) 6= ∅}, an open neighbourhood of s

since x ∈ U3 ∩ Φ(s). Set now

V := π−1(p(U2 ∩ U3 ∩ U4)) ∩ π−1(p(U1 ∩ U4)) ∩ V1 ∩ V2 ∩ V ′.

We have s ∈ π−1(p(U2 ∩ U3 ∩ U4)) since y ∈ U2 ∩ U3 ∩ U4 and p(y) = p(f (s)) = π(s).
Moreover, f (s) ∈ U1 ∩ U4 hence s ∈ π−1(p(U1 ∩ U4)). We conclude that V is an
open neighbourhood of s. If s′ ∈ V ⊂ V1 then f (s′) ∈ U1 and π(s′) ∈ p(U1 ∩ U4).
Thus there is x1 ∈ U1 ∩ U4 with p(x1) = π(s′) and

(3)

kf (s′) − x1k < ε

since U1 is ε-thin. For s′ ∈ V we have π(s′) ∈ p(U2 ∩ U3 ∩ U4) hence there is
x2 ∈ U2 ∩ U3 ∩ U4 such that p(x2) = π(s′). From s′ ∈ V ⊂ V2 we get h(s′) ∈ U2

and

(4)

kh(s′) − x2k < ε/4.

The set U4 is 3/4ε-thin so

(5)

kx1 − x2k < 3/4ε.

A SELECTION THEOREM FOR BANACH BUNDLES AND APPLICATIONS

9

Finally, if s′ ∈ V ⊂ V ′ then there is x3 ∈ U3 ∩ Φ(s′) and we have

(6)

kx2 − x3k < ε/4

since U3 is ε/4-thin. From (4) and (6) we get

kh(s′) − x3k ≤ kh(s′) − x2k + kx2 − x3k < ε/2.

Therefore, if s′ ∈ V then B(h(s′), ε/2) ∩ Φ(s′) 6= ∅. Also, if s′ ∈ V we get from (4),

(5) and (3) that

kh(s′) − f (s′)k ≤ kh(s′) − x2k + kx2 − x1k + kx1 − f (s′)k < ε/4 + 3ε/4 + ε = 2ε

and the claim is established.

As mentioned above, what has been done up to this point is irrelevant for (i).

To obtain the proof of (i) from what follows one has to ignore every aﬃrmation

about the function f .

We know now that there exist an open covering {Vα}α∈A of S and admissible

ε/2-continuous functions hα : S → E such that B(hα(s), ε/2) ∩ Φ(s) 6= ∅ and

kf (s) − hαk < 2ε for every s ∈ Vα. For proving (i) one obtains this from Lemma

2.6. We may and shall suppose that the covering of S is locally ﬁnite. Let {ϕα}

be a partition of unity subordinated to {Vα}. and deﬁne g := Pα ϕαhα. Each

point s ∈ S has a neighbourhood Os such that there exists a ﬁnite set Fs ⊂ A with

the property that Os ∩ Vα = ∅ is α /∈ Fs. Thus g is well deﬁned, admissible and

ε/2-continuous by Lemma 2.4. We have B(g(s), ε/2) ∩ Φ(s) 6= ∅ for every s ∈ S.

Indeed, choose zα ∈ B(hα(s), ε/2) ∩ Φ(s) for α ∈ Fs. Then z :=Pα∈Fs zα ∈ Φ(s)

and

kg(s) − zk ≤ Xα∈Fs

ϕα(s)khα(s) − zαk < ε/2.

Furthermore,

kg(s)−f (s)k ≤ k Xα∈Fs

ϕα(s)hα(s)−Xα∈Fs

ϕα(s)f (s)k ≤ Xα∈Fs

and the proof is complete.

ϕα(s)khα(s)−f (s)k < 2ε

(cid:3)

Lemma 2.8. Let {fn} be a sequence of admissible ε-continuous (ε > 0) functions,

uniformly convergent on S. Then its limit f is admissible and 2ε-continuous.

10

ALDO J. LAZAR

Proof. Clearly f is admissible; we have only to prove that it is 2ε-continuous. Let

n be such that kf (s) − fn(s)k < ε/2 for every s ∈ S. For s0 ∈ S there are a
neighbouhood V of s0 and a neighbourhood U ′ of fn(s0) such that fn(V ) ⊂ U ′.
Now, fn is admissible so π(V ) ⊂ U ′. Put U := U ′ ∩ p−1(π(V )) and

W := {x + y | p(x) = p(y) ∈ π(V ), kxk < ε/2, y ∈ U }.

Then Lemma 2.3 yields that W is an open neighbourhoo of f (s0) and it is easily

seen that it is 2ε-thin.

If s ∈ V then f (s) = fn(s) + (f (s) − fn(s)) ∈ W . We

conclude that f is 2ε-continuous at s0.

(cid:3)

In all the applications but one of the theorem that follows the setup will be

somewhat simpler; we shall have S = T and π will be the identity map of T .

Theorem 2.9. Let ξ := (p, E, T ) be a Banach bundle, S a paracompact topological

space, π a continuous open map of S onto T and Φ a lower semi-continuous map

from S to the family of non-empty closed subsets of E such that Φ(s) is a convex

subset of the ﬁber p−1(π(s)) for every s ∈ S. Then there exists a continuous

admissible function f : S → E such that f (s) ∈ Φ(s) for every s ∈ S. Moreover, if

s0 ∈ S and x0 ∈ Φ(s0) then f can be chosen so that f (s0) = x0.

Proof. By Lemma 2.7 (i) there exists an 1/2-continuous admissible function f1

such that B(f1(s), 1/2) ∩ Φ(s) 6= ∅ for every s ∈ S. We proceed now by induction.
Suppose that admissible functions {fi}n
i=1 are given such that each fi is 1/2i-
continuous, satisﬁes B(fi(s), 1/2i) ∩ Φ(s) 6= ∅ and kfi(s) − fi+1(s)k < 1/2i−1 for
every s ∈ S and 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. By Lemma 2.7 (ii) there exists an i/2n+1-

continuous admissible function fn+1 such that B(fn+1(s), 1/2n+1) ∩ Φ(s) 6= ∅ and
kfn(s) − fn+1(s)k < 1/2n−1 for every s ∈ S. The sequence {fn} is uniformly
convergent on S. The limit f is admissible and 1/2n-continuous for n ≥ 1 by

Lemma 2.8. Thus f is continuous on S by Lemma 2.2. Obviously f (s) ∈ Φ(s) for

each s ∈ S.

The second assertion of the theorem follows from the ﬁrst by considering the

lower semi-continuous set valued map

(7)

Φ(s) :=(Φ(s), s 6= s0,

x0, s = s0.

A SELECTION THEOREM FOR BANACH BUNDLES AND APPLICATIONS

11

(cid:3)

Theorem 2.9 is a generalization of [8, Proposition 15.13] where the case S =

T , a compact Hausdorﬀ space, π being the identity map of T , is discussed. By

considering a trivial Banach bundle one can deduce from Theorem 2.9 the existence

of the selection part of Michael’s [16, Theorem 3.2”]. Another known result that

can be deduced from Theorem 2.9 is the observation on p. 15 of [4] that partial

section over closed subsets of the base space can be extended to sections over the

entire base space. We state below the precise result.

Corollary 2.10. Let ξ := (p, E, T ) be a Banach bundle with paracompact base

space, A a closed subset of T and ϕ : A → E a section of ξ | A. Then there exists a

section ˜ϕ : T → E of ξ that extends ϕ. Moreover, if ϕ is bounded then there exists

a bounded extension ˜ϕ. If ξ := (E, p, T ) is a Banach bundle with locally compact

Hausdorﬀ base space, A a compact subset of T and ϕ a section of ξ | A then there

is a section ˜ϕ ∈ Γ0(ξ) that extends ϕ.

Proof. The ﬁrst claim is obtained by applying Theorem 2.9 to the set valued map

(8)

Φ(t) :=({ϕ(t)}, t ∈ A,

p−1(t), t ∈ T \ A.

To get a bounded extension in case ϕ is bounded one multiplies a section that

extends ϕ by a bounded continuous scalar valued function that is constantly equal

to 1 on A. Finally, when T is locally compact Hausdorﬀ and A is compact one

extends ϕ to a section ϕ′ of ξ | V , V being an open neighbourhood of A with

compact closure. With f : T → [0, 1] a continuous function such that f | A ≡ 1

and f | T \ V ≡ 0 one deﬁnes

3. Banach bundle maps

We shall now discuss Banach bundle maps and the way they aﬀect various spaces

of sections. We shall end this chapter with an extension of a well known result of

Bartle and Graves [3] to Banach bundle maps.

Let ξ1 := (E1, p1, T ) and ξ2 := (E2, p2, T ) be Banach bundles. Recall that a

Banach bundle map from ξ1 to ξ2 is a continuous map ϕ : E1 → E2 such that

p2 ◦ ϕ = p1 and which acts linearly on each ﬁber of ξ1. The restriction of ϕ to
p−1
1 (t), t ∈ T , is a bounded linear operator into p−1
2 (t) which we shall denote by
ϕt. The Banach bundle map ϕ induces a linear map ˜ϕ : Γ(ξ1) → Γ(ξ2) as follows:

˜ϕ(f )(t) := ϕ(f (t)), f ∈ Γ(ξ1), t ∈ T.

This map ˜ϕ need not be onto Γ(ξ2) even if ϕ is onto E2. To illustrate this we shall

present an example inspired by one in [2]. In order to have ˜ϕ(Γ(ξ1) = Γ(ξ2) one

has to require ϕ to be open.

Example 3.1. Let

E1 := [0, 1] × (K × K), E2 := ({0} × ({0} × K)) ∪ ((0, 1] × (K × K))K))

and p be the projection of E1 onto [0, 1]. We give the linear space {t}×(K×K) ⊂ E1

the norm k(t, (x, y))k := max(|x|, |y|). Then ξ1 := (E1, p, [0, 1]) is a trivial Banach

bundle and ξ2 := (E2, p | E2, [0, 1]) a Banach subbundle of ξ1. Deﬁne the Banach

bundle map ϕ : E1 → E2 by ϕ(t, (x, y)) := (t, (tx, y)). Then ϕ(E1) = E2.
obvious that the section f (t) := (t, (t1/2, 1)) of Γ(ξ2) has no preimage in Γ(ξ1).

It is

Theorem 3.2. Let ξi := (Ei, p1, T ), i = 1, 2, be Banach bundles with T paracompact

and ϕ := E1 → E2 an open Banach bundle map onto E2. Then ˜ϕ(Γ(ξ1)) = Γ(ξ2).

Proof. Let f ∈ Γ(ξ2) and deﬁne Φ(t) := ϕ−1(f (t)), t ∈ T . We are going to show

that Φ is lower semi-continuous. To this end let U ⊂ E1 be open and suppose

U ∩ Φ(t0) 6= ∅. Thus there exists x0 ∈ U with p(x0) = t0 and ϕ(x0) = f (t0). The

set ϕ(U ) is open in E2 therefore there exists an open neighbourhood V of t0 such

that f (V ) ⊂ ϕ(U ). It follows that t0 ∈ V ⊂ {t ∈ T | U ∩ Φ(t) 6= ∅} and we conclude

that the latter set is open. By Theorem 2.9 Φ admits a continuous selection g. This

is a section of ξ1 that satisﬁes ˜ϕ(g) = f .

(cid:3)

Thus it seems to be of some interest to establish conditions for a Banach bundle

map which is onto the bundle space of the image to be open.

Proposition 3.3. Let ξ1 := (E1, p1, T ) be a full Banach bundle and ϕ a Banach

bundle map of ξ1 onto ξ2 := (E2, p2, T ). Then ϕ is open if and only if there exists

an open cover {Vα}α∈A of T and positive numbers {mα}α∈A such that for every
y ∈ p−1

2 (Vα) there is x ∈ E1 that satisﬁes ϕ(x) = y and kxk ≤ mαkyk, α ∈ A,

Proof. Suppose that ϕ satisﬁes the condition; we are going to show that ϕ is open
on p−1
U ⊂ p−1

1 (Vα), α ∈ A, and this will prove the ’if’ part of the statement. So let
1 (Vα) be an open set and y0 ∈ ϕ(U ). Denote t0 := p2(y0) ∈ Vα and let
x0 ∈ U be such that ϕ(x0) = y0 and f ∈ Γ(ξ1) with f (t0) = x0. There exist an

open neighbourhood V of t0 in Vα and ε > 0 such that

x0 ∈ {x ∈ p−1

1 (Vα) | p1(x) ∈ V, kx − f (p1(x))k < ε} ⊂ U.

If not then there would exist a net {xι} in p−1

1 (Vα) \ U such that {p1(xι)} converges
to t0 and kxι − f (p1(xι))k → 0. But that means xι → f (t0) = x0 ∈ U , a contradic-
tion. Hence V and ε > 0 as claimed indeed exist. Put ˜f := ˜ϕ(f ). We claim now

that the open neighbourhood

U ′; = {y ∈ p−1

2 (Vα) | p2(y) ∈ V, ky − ˜f (p2(y))k < ε/mα}

of y0 is contained in ϕ(U ). Indeed, let y ∈ U ′. By our assumption, there exists
x ∈ p−1

1 (p2(y)) such that ϕ(x) = y − ˜f (p2(y)) and

kxk ≤ mαky − ˜f (p2(y))k < ε.

Since

k(x + f (p2(y))) − f (p2(y))k = kxk < ε

we get x + f (p2(y)) ∈ U and y = ϕ(x + f (p2(y))) ∈ ϕ(U ) as needed.

Suppose now that ϕ is open. Let t ∈ T . The set ϕ({x ∈ E1 | kxk < 1}) is

an open neighbourhood of 0t. There exist an open neighbourhood Vt of t and a

positive number kt such that

{y ∈ E2 | p2(y) ∈ Vt, kyk < kt} ⊂ ϕ({x ∈ E1 | kxk < 1}).

If not then there would exist a net {yι} in E2 \ ϕ({x ∈ E1 | kxk}) such that {p2(yι)}

converges to t and kyιk → 0. But then yι → 0t, a contradiction. We are going to

show that Vt and kt have the property that for y ∈ p−1

2 (Vt) there exists x such that

ϕ(x) = y and

kxk ≤

kyk.

Now, for y ∈ p−1

2 (Vt), y 6= 0, there exists x′ ∈ p−1

1 (p2(y)) such that kx′k < 1 and

The openness of a map between two Banach bundles intervenes also when looking

at the preimage of a Banach subbundle. Returning to Example 3.1, one can see

that the preimage of the null subbundle {0t | t ∈ T } of ξ2 by the map ϕ is E ′ :=

{(0, (K × {0}))} ∪ {(0, 1] × {(0, 0)} which cannot be the space bundle of a subbundle
of ξ1. The subset {(0, ({Re(x) > 0 | x ∈ K} × {0})} is relatively open in E ′ but its

image by the projection p1 is {0}.

Proposition 3.4. Let ϕ be an open Banach bundle map of the Banach bundle ξ1 :=

(E1, p1, T )

We turn our attention now to the spaces of bounded sections. In order to have

˜ϕ(Γb(ξ1)) ⊂ Γb(ξ2) for a Banach bundle map between two Banach bundles it is quite

natural to require supt∈T kϕtk < ∞. However, even in the situation of Theorem
3.2 one does not necessarily have ˜ϕ(Γb(ξ1)) = Γb(ξ2). Indeed, let E1 = E2 := N × K,
p1 = p2 the projection on N, and ξi := (Ei, pi, N), i = 1, 2, ϕ(n, x) := (n, x/n2).

The bounded section of ξ2 given by n → (n, 1/n) is the image of only one section

of ξ1: the unbounded section n → (n, n).

A SELECTION THEOREM FOR BANACH BUNDLES AND APPLICATIONS

Theorem 3.5. Let T be a paracompact space and ξi := (Ei, pi, T ), i = 1, 2, Banach

bundles. Let ϕ be a Banach bundle map of ξ1 onto ξ2 such that supt∈T kϕtk < ∞.

Then ˜ϕ(Γb(ξ1)) = Γb(ξ2) if and only if there is a positive number m with the property

that for each y ∈ E2 there exists x ∈ E1 such that ϕ(x) = y and kxk ≤ mkyk.

Proof. Suppose a constant m > 0 as in the above statement exists. Then ϕ is

an open map by Proposition 3.3. Let f ∈ Γb(ξ2) and deﬁne the set valued map
Φ(t) := {x ∈ p−1
non-void convex subset of p−1

1 (t) | ϕ(x) = f (t), kxk < (m + 1)kf k}, t ∈ T . Then Φ(t) is a
1 (t) for every t ∈ T . We are going to show that Φ is
lower semi-continuous. Let U be an open subset of E1 and suppose U ∩ Φ(t0) 6= ∅.

Thus there exists x0 ∈ U ∩ {x ∈ E1 | kxk < (m + 1)kf k} ∩ Φ(t0). The subset

ϕ(U ∩ {x ∈ E1 | kxk < (m + 1)kf k} of E2 is an open neighbourhood of f (t0); hence

there exists a neighbourhood V of t0 in T such that

f (t) ∈ ϕ(U ∩ {x ∈ E1 | kxk < (m + 1)kf k}). t ∈ V.

Therefore, for each t ∈ T there exists xt ∈ U ∩ {x ∈ E1 | kxk < (m + 1)kf k} such

that ϕ(xt) = f (t). It follows that V is a neighbourhood of t0 such that U ∩ Φ(t) 6= ∅

for every t ∈ V and we obtained that Φ is lower semi-continuous. Now, it is easily
seen that t → Φ(t) is lower semi-continuous too. Moreover, from Φ(t) ⊂ p−1
and the fact that p−1

1 (t)
1 (t) is closed in E1 we gather that kxk ≤ (m + 1)kf k for each
x ∈ Φ(t). Thus, a continuous selection g of t → Φ(t) given by Theorem 2.9 is a

bounded section of ξ1 that satisﬁes ˜ϕ(g) = f and we are done with this half of the

proof.

Suppose now that ˜ϕ(Γb(ξ1) = Γb(ξ2).

It is a well known consequence of the

Banach open mapping theorem that there exists a constant k > 0 with the property

that for every f ∈ Γ(ξ2) there exists g ∈ Γb(ξ1) such that ˜ϕ(g) = f and kgk ≤ kkf k.

We claim that for every y ∈ E2 there exists x ∈ E1 such that ϕ(x) = y and kxk ≤
3k/2kyk. Indeed, for y ∈ E2, y 6= 0, denote t := p2(y) and let f ′ ∈ Γb(ξ2) satisfy
f ′(t) = y. There exists a neighbourhood V of t in T such that kf ′(t′)k < 3/2kf ′(t)k

whenever t′ ∈ V . Let h : T → [0, 1] be a continuous function such that h(t) = 1

and h | (T \ V ) ≡ 0. Then f ; = hf ′ satisﬁes f (t) = y and kf k ≤ 3/2kyk. Let now

g ∈ Γb(ξ1) be such that ˜ϕ(g) = f and kgk ≤ kkf k. Then ϕ(g(t)) = y and

kg(t)k ≤ kgk ≤ kkf k ≤ 3k/2kyk

16

and this establishes our claim.

(cid:3)

Remark 3.6. The ’if’ direction of the above theorem in the case of a quotient map

is part of [8, Theorem 9.14].

For a Banach bundle ξ whose base space is locally compact Hausdorﬀ the space

Γ0(ξ) is of interest and we shall look now at the behavior of such spaces under a

Banach bundle map.

Lemma 3.7. Let ξ := (E, p, T ) be a Banach bundle and h : T → (0, ∞) a contin-

uous function. Then F := {x ∈ E | p(x) = t, kxk < h(t)} is an open subset of

E.

Proof. Let x0 ∈ F and put t0 = p(x0). There exists an open neighbourhood V of

t0 such that h(t) > h(t0) − 1/2(h(t0) − kx0k) if t ∈ V . Now, it is easily checked
that p−1(V ) ∩ {x ∈ E | kxk < 1/2(kx0k + h(t0))} ⊂ F and we are done.

(cid:3)

Theorem 3.8. Let ξ1 := (E1, p1, T ) be a Banach bundle and ξ2 := (E2, p2, T ) be

a continuous Banach bundle with T locally compact Hausdorﬀ. Suppose that ϕ is

a Banach bundle map of E1 onto E2 such that supt∈T kϕtk < ∞. If there exists

a positive constant m with the property that for each y ∈ E2 there exists x ∈ E1

satisfying ϕ(x) = y and kxk < mkyk then ˜ϕ(Γ0(ξ1)) = Γ0(ξ2).

Proof. Let g ∈ Γ0(ξ1) and ε > 0. From

k ˜ϕ(g)(t)k = kϕ(g(t))k ≤ kg(t)k sup
t′∈T

kϕt′ k

we obtain that {t ∈ T | k ˜ϕ(g)(t)k ≥ ε} is a closed subset of the compact set

{t ∈ T | kg(t)k ≥ ε/ supt′ kϕt′k}. Thus ˜ϕ(g) ∈ Γ0(ξ2) and we got ˜ϕ(Γ0(ξ1)) ⊂

Γ0(ξ2).

Let now f ∈ Γ0(ξ2). Then T ′ := {t ∈ T | kf (t)k > 0} is an open σ-compact

subset of T ; it is paracompact by [5, Corollary 2, p. 211]. Deﬁne

Φ(t) := {x ∈ p−1

1 (t) | ϕ(x) = f (t), kxk < (m + 1)kf (t)k}

for t ∈ T ′. Then Φ(t) is a non-void convex subset of the Banach space p−1

1 (t). We
are going to show that t → Φ(t) is lower semi-continuous on T ′. With U an open

subset of p−1
(m + 1)kf (t0)k and x0 ∈ U ∩ {x ∈ p−1
The set U ′ := U ∩ {x ∈ p−1

1 (T ′) suppose U ∩ Φ(t0) 6= ∅, t0 ∈ T ′. Let x0 ∈ U ∩ Φ(t0). Then kx0k <
1 (T ′) | kxk < 1/2(kx0k + (m + 1)kf (t0)k)}.
1 (T ′) | kxk < 1/2(kx0k + (m + 1)kf (t0)k)} is an open
subset of E1 and ϕ is an open map by Proposition 3.3; hence ϕ(U ′) is an open

neighbourhood of ϕ(x0) = f (t0). There exists an open neighbourhood V of t0 in
T ′ such that f (t) ∈ ϕ(U ′) and kf (t)k > kf (to)k − 1/2(kf (t0)k − kx0k/(m + 1))
for t ∈ V . Thus, if t ∈ V there exists xt ∈ U ′ such that ϕ(xt) = f (t). Then

kxtk < 1/2(kxok + (m + 1)kf (t0)k) < (m + 1)kf (t)k and we have xt ∈ U ∩ Φ(t).

We got t0 ∈ V ⊂ U ∩ Φ(t) and we can conclude that t → Φ(t) is indeed lower

semi-continuous.

The set valued map t → Φ(t), t ∈ T ′, is lower semi-continuous too and each set

Φ(t) is a non-void closed subset of {x ∈ p−1

1 (t) | kxk ≤ (m+1)kf (t)k}. By Theorem
2.9 there exists a continuous selection g′ of Φ on T ′. We have ϕ(g′(t)) = f (t) and

kg′(t)k ≤ (m + 1)kf (t)k for each t ∈ T ′. Deﬁne now

g(t) =(g′(t),

0t,

if t ∈ T ′,
if t ∈ T \ T ′.

The function g : T → E is continuous. Indeed, let {tα} be a net in T ′ that converges
to t ∈ T \ T ′. then f (tα) → f (t) = 0t; from 0 ≤ kg(tα)k ≤ (m + 1)kf (tα)k we

derive kg(tα)k → 0. Hence g(tα) → 0t = g(t). If ε > 0 then {t ∈ T | kg(t)k ≥ ε} is

compact since it is a closed subset of the compact set {t ∈ T | kf (t)k ≥ ε/(m + 1)}.

We got g ∈ Γ0(ξ1) with ˜ϕ(g) = f and we conclude ˜ϕ(Γ0(ξ1)) = Γ0(ξ2).

(cid:3)

We shall now consider results suggested by [3] and [16] on the existence of right

inverses for some Banach bundle maps.

Proposition 3.9. Let ϕ be an open Banach bundle map of ξ1 := (E1, p1, T ) onto

ξ2 := (E2, p2, T ). Suppose that E2 is paracompact. Then there exists a continuous

map ψ : E2 → E1 such that ϕ(ψ(y)) = y for every y ∈ E2.

Proof. Deﬁne Φ(y) := ϕ−1(y), y ∈ E2. By using the fact that ϕ is open one easily

sees that Φ is lower semi-continuous. An application of Theorem 2.9 in the obvious

manner yields a continuous selection ψ : E2 → E1 of Φ that fulﬁlls what is needed.

(cid:3)

18

To obtain a homogeneous right inverse we shall suppose that the range of the

Banach bundle map is a continuous Banach bundle. But ﬁrst we have to state

two simple lemmas. We omit their elementary proofs; the ﬁrst can be proven by

the means of an obvious compactness argument and the second lemma is an easy

consequence of the ﬁrst. We let µ be the normalized Lebesgue measure on the unit
circle in C and [λ1λ2 will denote the arc of the unit circle from λ1 to λ2 in the
positive direction.

Lemma 3.10. Let ξi := (Ei, pi, T ), i = 1, 2 be two Banach bundles over the complex

ﬁeld, f : E2 → E1 a continuous function and {yα}α∈A a net in E2 that converges

to y ∈ E2. Given ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that |f (λ1yα) − f (λ2yα)| < ε and
|f (λ1y) − f (λ2y)| < ε whenever |λ1| = |λ2| = 1, µ([λ1λ2) < δ and for every α ∈ A.

Lemma 3.11. Let ξ1, ξ2, f , {yα}α∈A, and y be as in Lemma 3.10. Given ε > 0
there exists δ > 0 with the following property: if {λi}n

i=1, λ1 = λn, is a division of

the unit circle in the complex plane with mesh smaller than δ then

Proposition 3.12. Let ϕ be a Banach bundle map from the Banach bundle ξ1 :=

(E1, p1, T ) onto the continuous Banach bundle ξ2 := (E2, p2, T ). Suppose that E2 is

paracompact and there exists m > 0 with the propriety that for every y ∈ E2 there

exists x ∈ E1 such that ϕ(x) = y and kxk ≤ mkyk. Then there exists a continuous

map ψ := E2 → E1 such that ϕ(ψ(y)) = y and ψ(λy) = λψ(y) for every y ∈ E2 and

λ ∈ K.

Proof. The set S := {y ∈ E2 | kyk = 1} is closed in E2 thus paracompact. We

deﬁne Φ(y) := {x ∈ E1 | ϕ(x) = y, kxk < m + 1}, y ∈ S. Then Φ(y) is a
non-empty convex subset of p−1

1 (p2(y)) and we want to show that Φ is lower semi-

continuous. So let U be an open subset of E1 and suppose U ∩ Φ(y0) 6= ∅. Then

A SELECTION THEOREM FOR BANACH BUNDLES AND APPLICATIONS

19

U ′ := ϕ(U ∩ {x ∈ E1 | kxk < m + 1}) is an open subset of E2 since ϕ is an open map
by Proposition 3.3 and y0 ∈ U ′ ∩ F . If y ∈ U ′ ∩ F then there exists x ∈ U such that
kxk < m + 1 and ϕ(x) = y. Thus U ∩ Φ(y) 6= ∅ if y ∈ U ′ ∩ F and we have proved

that Φ is lower semi-continuous. The map y → Φ(y) is also lower semi-continuous

and Theorem 2.9 yields a continuous function g : F → E1 such that ϕ(g(y)) = y

and kg(y)k ≤ m + 1 for y ∈ F . By deﬁning

h(y) :=(kykg(y/kyk),

0,

if kyk 6= 0,
otherwise

for y ∈ E2 one gets a continuous function from E2 to E1 such that ϕ(h(y)) = y for

y ∈ E2.. If the scalars are real then one easily checks that ψ(y) := 1/2(h(y)−h(−y))

has the required properties. Suppose now that the scalars are complex. Then we

deﬁne

ψ(y) := Z|λ|=1

¯λh(λy)dµ(λ),

y ∈ E2.

The function ψ has all the needed properties. We shall prove only its continuity

all its other attributes being straightforward to check. So let y ∈ E2 and suppose

{yα}α∈A is a net that converges to y. We denote t := p2(y) and tα := p2(yα). Let U

be an open neighbourhood of ψ(y). Now T is paracompact being homeomorphic to

the closed subspace {0τ }τ ∈T of E2. So there exist a section σ of ξ1, a neighbourhood

V of t contained in p1(U ) and ε > 0 such that σ(t) = ψ(y) and

U ′ := {x ∈ E1 | p1(x) ∈ V,

kx − σ(p1(x))k < 2ε} ⊂ U.

Let now δ be the positive number given by Lemma 3.11 for our number ε and the

integrant appearing in the deﬁnition of ψ. Suppose {λi}n

of the unit circle of mesh less than δ. Then kψ(y) −Pn−1

We denote

¯λih(λiy)µ( \λiλi+1) belongs to the open set U ′′. There exists α0 ∈ A

¯λih(λiyα)µ( \λiλi+1) − σ(p2(yα))k < ε if α ≻ α0 and

Remark 3.13. It follows from the proof of Proposition 3.12 that the map ψ satisﬁes

kψ(y)k ≤ (m + 1)kyk for every y ∈ E2. Thus one can easily obtain a proof of

Theorem 3.8 by using Proposition 3.12 if in addition to the other hypotheses of

that theorem one supposes that E2 is paracompact.

4. M-ideals of Γ0(ξ)

For the present section ξ := (E, p, T ) will be a ﬁxed Banach bundle. We shall

mainly discuss the M-ideals of the Banach space Γ0(ξ) when the base space is locally

compact Hausdorﬀ; most of the results that follow are generalizations of results from

[8] where only the case of a compact Hausdorﬀ base space was considered. As in

[8], for a closed subset A of T the notation NA will stand for {σ ∈ Γb | σ(t) =

0t

for all

t ∈ A} or for {σ ∈ Γ0(ξ) | σ(t) = 0t

for all

t ∈ A} if T is locally

compact Hausdorﬀ; it will be clear from the context which is the case. If A is a

singleton, say {t}, then we shall use the notation Nt instead of N{t}.

In [8, Proposition 13.6] the base space is assumed to be compact Hausdorﬀ.

However the proof given there is valid with obvious modiﬁcations in the more

general situations detailed in the next Proposition. Of course, we omit its proof.

Proposition 4.1. The closed subspace NA is an M-ideal of Γb(ξ) if A is a closed

subset of the normal space T . For a locally compact Hausdorﬀ base space T NA is

an M-deal of Γ0(ξ) if A is a compact subset of T or if A is a closed subset of T

such that the complement of its interior is compact.

Proposition 4.2. Suppose T is paracompact (locally compact Hausdorﬀ ) and A

and B are closed (compact, respectively) subsets of T . Then NA∩B = NA + NB.

Proof. We must prove only NA∩B ⊂ NA + NB. Let σ ∈ NA∩B and deﬁne ρ :

A ∪ B → E by ρ(t) := σ(t) if t ∈ A and ρ(t) := 0t if t ∈ B. Then ρ is well deﬁned

and continuous on A ∪ B. Corollary 2.10 provides us with an extension of ̺ in

Γb(ξ) (Γ0(ξ), respectively); we shall call this extension ρB. We have ρB ∈ NB and

ρA := σ − ρB is in A.

An M-ideal L of a Banach space X is called primitive if there is an extreme point

ω of the closed unit ball of the dual space X ′ such that L is maximal among the

M-ideals contained in the null subspace of ω. If L is a primitive M-ideal and L1,

L2 are M-ideals such that L1 ∩ L2 ⊂ L then L1 ⊂ L or L2 ⊂ L. Every M-ideal is

the intersection of the primitive M-ideals containing it. For all these facts see [1,

Section 3].

In the remainder of this section the base space T will always be a locally compact

Hausdorﬀ space.

The case T compact Hausdorﬀ of the following proposition is part of [8, Propo-

sition 13.11].

Proposition 4.3. If L is a primitive M-ideal of Γ0(ξ) then there is a unique t0 ∈ T

such that Nt0 ⊂ L.

Proof. Let K be a non-void compact subset of T . Then NK and NT \K are M-
ideals of Γ0(ξ) by Proposition 4.1 and NK ∩ NT \K = {0} ⊂ L. We infer that NK
or NT ⊂K is included in L. If for every such K we have NT \K ⊂ L then L = Γ0(ξ)
since the sections with compact support are dense in Γ0(ξ). Thus there exists a

non-void compact set K such that NK ⊂ L. Let F be the non-void family of all

non-void compact subsets of T such that NK ⊂ L.

If K1 and K2 belong to F

then NK1∩K2 = NK1 + NK2 ⊂ L and it follows that F has the ﬁnite intersection

property. Hence K0 := ∩{K | K ∈ F} 6= ∅.

Denote

Λ := ∪

K∈F

NK.

We claim that NK0 = Λ. Obviously Λ ⊂ NK0. Let now σ ∈ NK0 and ε > 0. Set

V := {t ∈ T | kσ(t)k < ε}; then V is open and K0 ⊂ V . If it were true that for each

K ∈ F there would be tK ∈ K \ V then the net {tK}K∈F would have a convergent

subnet whose limit would be in K0. On the other hand, kσ(tk)k ≥ ε for all K ∈ F ,

a contradiction. Thus there exists K ∈ F such that K ⊂ V . Let f : T → [0, 1] be a

continuous function such that f | K ≡ 0 and f | (T \ V ) ≡ 1. Then with σ′ := f · σ

we have σ′ ∈ NK and kσ − σ′k < ε. We infer that σ ∈ Λ and the claim follows from

this. In particular, K0 ∈ F .

It remains only to show that K0 consists of only one point. If there are in K0

at least two distinct points then there exist compact subsets K1, K2 of K0 such

that K0 = K1 ∪ K2 and K1 6= K0 6= K2. These subsets will have to satisfy

NK1 ∩ NK2 = NK0 ⊂ L. Hence NK1 ⊂ L or NK2 ⊂ L. But Ki ∈ F , i = 1 or 2, and

Ki $ K0 is a contradiction. Therefore K0 = {t0} for some t0 ∈ T and we found

Nt0 ⊂ L.

The uniqueness of t0 with the property Nt0 ⊂ L follows from the deﬁnitions of

F and K0.

(cid:3)

Now we can apply the same proof as in the compact case of [8, Proposition 15.20]

to get

Proposition 4.4. Every M-ideal L of Γ0(ξ) is a Cb(T )-module.

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that L is a primitive M-ideal and let t0 ∈ T be the element

given by Proposition 4.3.

If f ∈ Cb(T ) and σ ∈ L then f · σ − f (t0)σ belongs

to Nt0 ⊂ L. Hence f · σ ∈ L and the case of a primitive M-ideal is settled. The

general case follows from this particular case and the fact mentioned above that

each M-ideal is the intersection of the primitive M-ideals containing it.

(cid:3)

We proceed now to give a characterization of those closed subspaces of Γ0(ξ) that

are Cb(T )-modules. The parallel result for paracompact base spaces and spaces of

bounded sections is [8, Theorem 8.6]. First we state and prove a simple lemma.

Lemma 4.5. Let L be an M-ideal of Γ0(ξ), σ ∈ L, and suppose that kσ(t0)k < θ
for some t0 ∈ T and θ > 0. Then there is σ′ ∈ L such that σ′(t0) = σ(t0) and
kσ′k < θ.

Proof. Denote θ′ := 1/2(θ + kσ(t0)k). Then V := {t ∈ T | kσ(t)k < θ′} is an open

neighbourhood of t0 and T \ V is compact. Let f : T → [0, 1] be a continuous
function such that f (t0) = 1 and f | (T \ V ) ≡ 0. Deﬁne σ′ := f · σ. It is easily
checked that σ′ has the required properties.

Theorem 4.6. A closed subspace of Γ0(ξ) is a Cb(T )-submodule if and only if there

exists a subbundle η of ξ such that L = Γ0(η).

Proof. Obviously Γ0(η) for η a subbundle of ξ is a Cb(T )-submodule of Γ0(ξ).

Suppose now that the closed subspace L of Γ0(ξ) is a Cb(T )-submodule. Denote

F (t) := {σ(t) | σ ∈ L}, t ∈ T . Clearly F (t) is a linear subspace of E(t) and we

are going to show that it is closed in E(t). Let {xn} be a sequence in F (t) that

converges to x ∈ E(t). By passing to a subsequence if necessary we may suppose

that kxn+1 − xnk < 2−n for each n ∈ N. There exist σn ∈ L such that σn(t) = xn,
n ∈ N. Put ̺1 := σ1; Lemma 4.5 yields ̺n ∈ L with ̺n(t) = σn+1(t) − σn(t) and

k̺nk < 2−n, n ≥ 2. The section ̺; =P∞

we deduce that x ∈ F (t).

n=1 ̺n is in L and ̺(t) = lim σn(t) = x and

Set F := ∪t∈T F (t); we are going to show that p | F is open. Let U be an open

subset of E and t0 ∈ p(U ∩ F ). There exists σ ∈ L such that σ(t0) ∈ U ∩ F . there

exists a neighbourhood V of t0 in T such that σ(t) ∈ U whenever t ∈ V . Then

V ⊂ p(U ∩ F ) and we obtained that p(U ∩ F ) is an open subset of T . We have

shown that η := (F , p | F , T ) is a subbundle of ξ.

We want to show now that L = Γ0(η). Clearly L ⊂ Γ0(η). Let σ ∈ Γ0(η)

and ε > 0. Then K := {t ∈ T | kσ(t)k ≥ ε} is a compact subset of T and, L

being a Cb(T ) module, for each t ∈ K there exists ̺t ∈ L such that ̺t(t) = σ(t)
and ̺t | (T \ K) ≡ 0. The set Vt := {t′ ∈ T | kσ(t′) − ̺t(t′)k < ε}, t ∈ K,

is open; for each t ∈ K we choose on open set Wt such that Wt is compact and
t ∈ Wt ⊂ Wt ⊂ Vt. There is a ﬁnite subcover {Wti }n

i=1 of the cover {Wt}t∈K
of K; let fi : T → [0, 1] be a continuous function such that fi | Wti ≡ 1 and
fi | (T \ Vti ) ≡ 0, 1 ≤ i ≤ n. On ∪n

and extend each gi to a continuous and bounded function on T . For simplicity, the

extension will be denoted also by gi. Deﬁne now ρ :=Pn

24

ALDO J. LAZAR

and kh(t)ρ(t) − σ(t)k < ε on K. If t ∈ T \ V then kh(t)ρ(t) − σ(t)k = kσ(t)k < ε

since K ⊂ V . Now, if t ∈ V \ K we have

(10) kh(t)ρ(t) − σ(t)k ≤ |h(t) − 1|kρ(t)k + kρ(t) − σ(t)k ≤

(1 − h(t))(kρ(t) − σ(t)k + kσ(t)k) + kρ(t) − σ(t)k < 3ε.

We have found h · ρ ∈ L such that kh · ρ − σ|| ≤ 3ε hence σ ∈ L and we conclude

that L = Γ0(η).

(cid:3)

The case of a compact base space of the following result is [8, Theorem 15.21]

for which only a brief indication of the proof was given.

Theorem 4.7. A closed subspace L of Γ0(ξ) is an M-ideal if and only if there exists

a subbundle η := (F , p | F , t) of ξ such that L = Γ0(η) and and each ﬁber F (t) is

an M-deal of the Banach space E(t).

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that L is an M-ideal of Γ(ξ). It follows from Proposition 4.4

and Theorem 4.6 that there exists a subbundle η := (F , p | F , T ) of ξ such that

L = Γ0(η). It remains to show that F (t) = {σ(t) | σ ∈ L} is an M-ideal of E(t).

For this purpose we proceed to show that F (t0) has the 3-ball-property in E(t0),
t0 ∈ T . Let {xi}3
exists x ∈ E(t0) with kxi − xk < ri, 1 ≤ i ≤ 3, and there exist {yi}3

i=1 be positive numbers such that there
i=1 in F (t0)
such that kxi − yik < ri, 1 ≤ i ≤ 3. There are sections σ, σi ∈ Γ0(ξ), such that

i=1 ⊂ E(t0) and let {ri}3

σ(t0) = x and σi(t0) = xi, 1 ≤ i ≤ 3, and sections ̺i ∈ Γ0(η) such that ̺i(t0) = yi,

1 ≤ i ≤ 3. The set

V ; = {t ∈ T | kσi(t) − σ(t)k < ri, kσi(t) − ̺i(t)k < ri, 1 ≤ i ≤ 3}

is an open neighbourhood of t0. Let f : T → [0, 1] be a continuous function such

that f (t0) = 1 and f | (T \ V ) ≡ 0. Then f · σ, f · σi ∈ Γ0(ξ) and f · ̺i ∈ Γ0(η),

1 ≤ i ≤ 3. We have kf · σi − f · σk < ri and kf · σi − f · ̺ik < ri, 1 ≤ i ≤ 3.

Since Γ0(η) is an M-ideal there is a section ̺ ∈ Γ0(η) such that kf · σi − ̺k < ri,

1 ≤ i ≤ 3. Then ̺(t0) ∈ F (t0) and kxi − ̺(t0)k = kf (t0)σi(t0) − ̺i(t0)k < ri,

1 ≤ i ≤ 3. Thus F (t0) has indeed the 3-ball-property in E(t0).

Now we suppose that η := (F , p | F , t) is a subbundle of ξ such that each F (t)

is an M-ideal of E(t). Since each subspace F (t) is closed in E(t) it is obvious that

A SELECTION THEOREM FOR BANACH BUNDLES AND APPLICATIONS

25

Γ0(η) is a closed subspace of Γ0(ξ). We are going to show that Γ0(η) has the 3-ball-
property in Γ0(ξ) and is thus an M-ideal of Γ0ξ). Let {ri}3

i=1 be positive numbers,

σi, σ ∈ Γ0(ξ), and ̺i ∈ Γ0(η), 1 ≤ i ≤ 3, so that kσi − σk < ri and kσi − ̺ik < ri,

1 ≤ i ≤ 3. Let r′

i be a number satisfying

max{kσi − σk, kσi − ̺ik} < r′

i < ri,

1 ≤ i ≤ 3 and set

C(t) := ∩3

i=1{y ∈ F (t) | kσi(t) − yk < r′

i}.

The subspace F (t) of E(t) has the 3-ball-property; hence C(t) is a non-void convex

subset of F (t), t ∈ T . We are going to show that the map t → C(t) is lower

semi-continuous. Let U be an open subset of E and suppose C(t0) ∩ U 6= ∅ for some

t0 ∈ T . Then there exists an element y0 ∈ C(t0) ∩ U and ̺0 ∈ Γ0(η) such that

̺0(t0) = y0. The open neighbourhood

V := (∩3

i=1{t ∈ T | kσi(t0) − ̺0(t0)k < r′

i}) ∩ {t ∈ T | ̺(t) ∈ U }

of t0 satisﬁes V ⊂ {t ∈ T | C(t) ∩ U 6= ∅} and the claim about t → C(t) is proved.

We infer that t → C(t), t ∈ T , is also lower semi-continuous. Remark that C(t) is a

non-void closed convex subset of F (t). Moreover, if y ∈ overlineC(t) then kyk ≤ r′
i

The set

K1 := ∪3

i=1{t ∈ T | kσi(t)k ≥ r′

i/2}

is compact and there exists an open subset U ⊃ K1 of T such that K2 : +U is
compact. Let ρ′ be a continuous selection of t → C(t) over K2 given by Theorem 2.9

and f : T → [0, 1] be a continuous function satisfying f | K1 ≡ 1 and f | (T \U ) ≡ 0.

Deﬁne

ρ(t) :=(f (t) · ρ′(t),

0t,

if t ∈ K2,
if t ∈ T \ U .

Then ρ is well deﬁned and ρıΓ0(η). We claim that kσi − ρk ≤ r′

i, 1 ≤ i ≤ 3 and
we shall conclude from this that Γ0(η) has the 3-ball-property in Γo(ξ). If t ∈ K1
then kσi(t) − ρ(t)k = kσi(t) − ρ′(t)k ≤ r′
i since ρ′(t) ∈ C(t). If t ∈ T \ U then
kσi(t) − ρ(t)k = kσi(t)k < r′

i/2. Finally, if t ∈ U \ K1 then

(11) kσi(t) − ρ(t)k ≤ kσi(t) − f (t) · σi(t)k + kf (t) · σi(t) − f (t) · ρ′(t)k

(1 − f (t))kσi(t)k + f (t)kσi(t) − ρ′(t)k ≤ (1 − f (t))r′

i/2 + f (t)r′

i ≤ r′
i,

and with this the claim is proved.

5. Uniform and locally uniform Banach bundles

In this section we shall describe a class of Banach bundles that is more general

than the class of locally trivial Banach bundles but it is still quite manageable. This

class was introduced in [14] under the guise of continuous ﬁelds of Banach spaces.

We remind the deﬁnition of the Hausdorﬀ distance between two bounded subsets

A, B of a metric space (M, ρ):

d(A, B) := max{sup
a∈A

ρ(a, B), sup
b∈B

ρ(b, A)}.

It is a metric in the family of all bounded closed subsets of M .

Recall that if X is a Banach space then X1 denotes its closed unit ball.

Lemma 5.1. Let X be a Banach space, M the family of its bounded closed subsets

endowed with the Hausdorﬀ metric, T a topological space, and t → X(t) a map Φ

from T to the collection of closed subspaces of X. If the map t → X(t)1 from T to

M is continuous then Φ is lower semi-continuous.

Proof. Let O be an open subset of X and suppose that O ∩ X(to) 6= ∅, t0 ∈ T .

Pick x0 ∈ O ∩ X(t0) and let r > 0 be so that B(x0, r) ⊂ O. From the continuity

of t → X(t)1 it follows that there exists a neighbouhood V of t0 in T such that for

each t ∈ V there exists yt ∈ X(t) satisfying kytk ≤ kx0k and kx0 − ytk < r. Thus,

if t ∈ V then O ∩ X(t) 6= ∅ and the proof is complete.

(cid:3)

We keep the setting and the notations of Lemma 5.1; to be consistent with our

blanket requirement we shall suppose that T is a Hausdorﬀ topological space. We

make {t} × X(t) into a Banach space by transfering onto it in the obvious way

the structure of X(t), t ∈ T . Put E; = ∪t∈T ({t} × X(t)) and deﬁne p : E → T

by p((t, x)) := t. For an open subset V of T and an open subset O of X let

U(V, O) := {(t, x) | t ∈ V, x ∈ O ∩ X(t)}.

Proposition 5.2. The family of all the sets U(V, O) when V runs through all the

open subsets of T and O runs through all the open subsets of X is a base of a

topology on E. When E is endowed with this topology ξ := (E, p, T ) is a continuous

Banach bundle.

A SELECTION THEOREM FOR BANACH BUNDLES AND APPLICATIONS

27

Proof. If (t, x) ∈ U(V1, O1) ∩ U(V2, O2) then

(t, x) ∈ U(V1 ∩ V2, O1 ∩ O2) ⊂ U(V1, O1) ∩ U(V2, O2);

hence the ﬁrst statement of the proposition.

If V ⊂ T is open then p−1(V ) =

U(V, X) so p is continuous. If V ⊂ T and O ⊂ X are open then p(U(V, O)) =

V ∩{t ∈ T | O∩X(t) 6= ∅} so Lemma 5.1 implies that this set is open in E. Thus ξ is

a Banach bundle. Let (t0, x0) ∈ E, r > 0 and set V := {t ∈ T | B(x0, r)∩X(t) 6= ∅}.

The continuity of the norm at (t0, x0) ∈ E follows from

(t0, x0) ∈ U(V, B(x0, r)) = {(t, x) | t ∈ V, x ∈ B(x0, r) ∩ X(t)} ⊂

{(t, x) ∈ E | k(t0, x0)k − r < k(t, x)k < k(t0, x0)k + r}.

(cid:3)

A continuous Banach bundle isomorphic to a Banach bundle as described in

Proposition 5.2 is called a uniform Banach bundle. A (continuous) Banach bundle

ξ := (E, p, T ) is called locally uniform if there exists a family of closed subsets

{Tα}α∈A of T such that {Int(Tα)}α∈A is an open cover of T and each restriction

ξ | Tα is a uniform Banach bundle. One should recall that if T is paracompact or

locally compact Hausdorﬀ then each subset Tα inherits the same property. If two

subspaces of a Banach space have diﬀerent dimensions then, by [9], the distance

between their closed unit balls is at least 1/2. Thus if ξ := (E, p, T ) is a locally

uniform Banach bundle and for some t ∈ T the ﬁber E(t) is n-dimensional, n < ∞,

then there exists a neighbourhood V of t in T such that for each s ∈ V the ﬁber

E(s) is n-dimensional. It follows that if all the ﬁbers of ξ are ﬁnite dimensional and

T is locally compact Hausdorﬀ then ξ is locally trivial by [8, Theorem 18.5]. On the

other hand there exist uniform Banach bundles with inﬁnite dimensional ﬁbers that

are not locally trivial. Indeed, Kadets [13] constructed a Banach space X having

subspaces {Xn}∞
n=1 and Y such that each subspace Xn is isometric to the space ℓpn
for a sequence {pn} that increases to 2 and Y is isometric to ℓ2}. Moreover, the

the sequence of the closed unit balls of the subspaces Xn converges to the closed
unit ball of Y 1. Thus we have here an example of a uniform Banach bundle whose

base space is N ∪ {∞} with the natural topology that is not isomorphic to a locally

28

trivial bundle since, as it is well known, the spaces ℓp′

and ℓp′′

are not isomorphic

if p′ 6= p′′.

We describe now a way to construct locally uniform Banach bundles. Let T be a

regular topological space, {Vα}α∈A a cover of T with open non-void subsets, {Xα}α

a family of Banach spaces such that whenever Vα ∩ Vβ 6= ∅, Xα ∩ Xβ is a non-trivial

closed subspace of Xα and of Xβ on which the norms k · kα and k · kβ coincide.

Denote by Mα the hyperspace of all bounded closed subsets of Xα endowed with

the Hausdorﬀ metric. Suppose that for each t ∈ Vα, α ∈ A, X(t) is a closed

subspace of Xα and t → X(t)1 is continuous as a map from Vα to Mα. Of course,

if t ∈ Vα ∩ Vβ then X(t) ⊂ Xα ∩ Xβ. Put

Eα := {(t, x) | t ∈ Vα, x ∈ X(t)}

and give Eα the topology speciﬁed in 5.2. That is, each pair of open subsets V ⊂ Vα

and O ⊂ Xα determines an open subset

U(V, O) := {(t, x) ∈ Eα | t ∈ V, x ∈ O ∩ X(t)}.

Observe that if Vα ∩ Vβ 6= ∅ then on Eα ∩ Eβ the two relative topologies coincide.

Set now E := ∪α∈AEα and deﬁne a topology in E as follows: U ⊂ E is open if U ∩ Eα

is open in Eα for every α ∈ A. Let p : E → T be the natural map.

Proposition 5.3. With the above notations ξ := (E, p, T ) is a locally uniform

Banach bundle.

Proof. For t ∈ Vα let At,α be a closed set such that t ∈ Int(At,α) ⊂ At,α ⊂ Vα.

Clearly the restriction of ξ to At,α is a uniform Banach bundle.

(cid:3)

Continuing with the above notations, if Y (t) is a closed subspace of X(t), t ∈ T ,

and t → Y (t)1 is continuous on T then, with F := {(t, x) | t ∈ T, x ∈ Y (t)},

ζ := (F , p | F , T ) is a (locally uniform) Banach subbundle of ξ. Indeed, if V is an

open subset of Vα and O is an open subset of Xα then

{(t, x) | t ∈ V, x ∈ O ∩ X(t)} ∩ {(t, x) | t ∈ Vα, x ∈ Y (t)} =

{(t, x) | t ∈ V, x ∈ O ∩ Y (t)}

is a typical open subset of F . Now it is clear that the Banach bundle constructed

in Proposition 5.2 is a Banach subbundle of a trivial Banach bundle. Indeed, with

A SELECTION THEOREM FOR BANACH BUNDLES AND APPLICATIONS

29

the notations used there, let E ′ := T × X and p′ the projection on T . Then ξ

is by the preceding remarks a Banach subbundle of ξ′ := (E ′, p′, T ). Note that E

is a closed subset of E ′. To see this, let {(tι, xι)}ι∈I be a net in E converging to

(t, x) ∈ T × X. There is no loss of generality if we suppose that xι ∈ BX (0X , 1),

ι ∈ I. For each ι there exists yι ∈ E(t) such that kxι − yιk ≤ d(E(tι)1, E(t)1), d

being the Hausdorﬀ metric. Now d(E(tι)1, E(t)1) → 0 so (t, x) ∈ E. On the other

hand, not every Banach subbundle of a trivial Banach bundle which has a closed

bundle space is a uniform Banach bundle.

Example 5.4. Let T := N ∪ {∞} with the usual topology, c0 the Banach space of all

null-convergent sequences of scalars, E := T × c0 and p the projection of E onto T .

We shall construct a Banach subbundle of the trivial Banach bundle ξ := (E, p, T ).

Denote by en ∈ c0 the sequence {δk

k=1 and let F (n) be the linear subspace of
{n} × c0 spanned by (n, e1) and (n, en). We let F (∞) be the one-dimensional space

n}∞

spanned by (∞, e1). With F := ∪t∈T F (t) the Banach subbundle ζ := (F , p | F , T )

of ξ has a closed bundle space. However, the bundle ζ is not locally uniform because

of the drop in dimension at ∞.

We have seen in Theorem 3.8 that for a bundle map it is of interest to have a

continuous norm in the image bundle. We discuss now conditions that insure that

the norm in a quotient bundle is continuous. It may happen that a quotient bundle

of a continuous Banach bundle has a discontinuous norm as the following example

shows.

Example 5.5. Let T := N ∪ {∞} with the usual topology, ξ := (T × K, p, T ) the

one-dimensional trivial bundle over T , and η its subbundle whose bundle space is

F := (N×K)∪({∞}×{0}). Then the quotient bundle space is (N×{0})∪({∞}×K)

with a non-Hausdorﬀ topology. Hence the quotient bundle is not a continuous

Banach bundle.

Question 5.6. Suppose η is a quotient bundle of a continuous Banach bundle and

the bundle space of η is Hausdorﬀ. Must η be a continuous Banach bundle?

Proposition 5.7. Let ξ := (E, p, T ) be a locally uniform Banach bundle and ξ′ :=

(E ′, p | E ′, T ) a locally uniform subbundle. Then the norm on the quotient bundle

η := (E/E ′, p′, T ) is continuous.

30

ALDO J. LAZAR

Proof. A moment’s reﬂection shows that it is enough to consider only the case when

ξ and ξ′ are uniform. Thus we shall suppose that ξ is a bundle as described in

Proposition 5.2 keeping the notation used there. We shall also suppose that Y (t) is

a closed subspace of X(t) and that the map t → Y (t)1, t ∈ T , is continuous into the

the space of all closed subsets of the ambient space X. Then E; + ∪t∈T ({t} × X(t))
and E ′; = ∪t∈T ({t} × Y (t)). Denote by q the quotient map from E to E/E ′ and
let α ≥ 0; we are going to show that O := {y ∈ E/E ′ | kyk > α} is open in E/E ′.

Suppose then that y0 ∈ O and choose numbers β and ε satisfying α < β < ky0k and

0 < ε < min{1/2, 1/3(ky0k−β)}. Let (t0, x0) ∈ E with q((t0, x0)) = y0 and put r :=

2kx0k+2. There exists a neighbourhood V of t0 in T such that d(Y (t)r, Y (t0)r) < ε

if t ∈ V . The set U(V, B(x0, ε)) := {(t, x) | t ∈ V, x ∈ B(x0, ε) ∩ X(t)} is an open

neighbourhood of (t0, x0) and q(U(V, B(x0, ε))) is an open neighbourhood of y0,

q being an open map. We shall show that q(U(V, B(x0, ε))) ⊂ O and this will

establish our claim about O thereby completing the proof.

Let (t, x) ∈ U(V, B(x0, ǫ)) and denote y := q(x). Our goal is to show that

kyk > α. There exists ˜x ∈ Y (t) such that kyk ≤ kx − ˜xk < kyk + ε. We have

k˜xk ≤ r. Indeed, if we assume by contradiction that k˜xk > r = 2kx0k + 2 then

k˜xk > 2kx − (x − x0)k + 2 > 2(kxk − ε) + 2 > 2kxk + 1. But then

kx − ˜xk ≥ k˜xk − kxk > kxk + 1 > kyk + ε,

a contradiction. Now, since t ∈ V and ˜x ∈ Y (t)r, there exists ˜x0 ∈ Y (t0)r such

that k˜x − ˜x0k < ε. We have

(12) kyk > kx − ˜xk − ε ≥ k(˜x − ˜x0) + (˜x0 − x0)k − kx0 − xk − ε ≥

k˜x0 − x0k − k˜x − ˜x0k − kx0 − xk − ε ≥ ky0k − 3ε > β > α

The quotient bundle of a uniform Banach bundle may have a continuous norm

even when the subbundle that produces it is not a locally uniform subbundle as the

following example shows.

Example 5.8. As before we denote by c0 the Banach space of all null converging
sequences of scalars and en := {δk
k=1, n ≥ 1. Let T := N ∪ {∞} with the usual

n}∞

topology, E := T × c0, and p be the projection onto T . We let Xn be the subspace
l=1, E ′(n) := {n} × Xn, and E ′(∞) := E(∞). We aﬃrm
of c0 spanned by {el}n
that ξ′ := (E ′, p | E ′, T ) is a subbundle of the trivial bundle ξ := (E, p, T ). Indeed,

suppose U ⊂ E is open and (∞, x) ∈ U ∩ E ′(∞). There are r > 0 and m ∈ N with
the property that if y ∈ c0, ky − xk < r, and n ≥ m then (n, y) ∈ U . Let k ∈ N be

such that ¯x; = (x1, . . . , xk, 0 . . . ) satisﬁes k¯x − xk < r. Then if n > max{m, k} one

has (n, ¯x) ∈ U ∩ E ′(n). Thus we found a neighbourhood of ∞ included in p(U ) and

the claim is proved.

Clearly ξ′ is not a locally uniform subbundle because of the disparity in the di-

mension of the ﬁber at ∞ with the dimensions of the other ﬁbers in any neighbour-

hood of ∞. It remains to show that the norm in the quotient bundle is continuous.

Only the continuity at the points of the ﬁber at ∞ must be proven; but since the

ﬁber at ∞ of the quotient bundle is trivial this fact is obvious.

Appendix A. Some topological properties of the bundle space

We shall now record several topological properties of the bundle space of a Ba-

nach bundle. In the following ξ := (E, p, T ) will denote a Banach bundle.

The ﬁrst result treats the complete regularity of the bundle space. A result with

the same conclusion but under diﬀerent hypotheses is [10, Lemma 2.1.6].

Proposition A.1. If ξ is a continuous Banach bundle and T is locally paracompact

then E is completely regular.

Proof. First remark that E is a Hausdorﬀ space since the norm is continuous on

it. Let A be a closed subset of E and x0 ∈ E with x0 /∈ A. There are an open

neighbourhood V of t0 := p(x0) in T such that V is paracompact and a continuous

function h : T → [0, 1] satisfying h(t0) = 1 and h | T \ V ≡ 0. Corollary 2.10

yields a section ϕ of ξ | V such that ϕ(t0) = x0; there exists α > 0 such that

{x ∈ E | p(x) ∈ V, kx − ϕ(p(x))k < α} ∩ A = ∅. Let µ : [0, ∞) → [0, 1] be given by

µ(s) :=(1 − s/α,

0,

if 0 ≤ s ≤ α,
if α < s.

The function f : E → [0, 1] deﬁned by

f (x) :=(µ(kx − ϕ(p(x))k)h(p(x)),

0,

if p(x) ∈ V ,
if p(x) /∈ V

satisﬁes f (x0) = 1 and f | A ≡ 0 as needed.

We proceed now to discuss a setting in which E is a Baire space. We begin with

some deﬁnitions and results from [18]. A family B of non-void open subsets of a

topological space is call ed a pseudo-base of the space if every open non-void subset

contains an element of B. A topological space Z is called quasi-regular if each non-

void open set of Z contains the closure of some non-void open set. A topological

space Z is called pseudo-complete if it is quasi-regular and there exists a sequence

{Bn} of pseudo-bases of Z with the property that if Un ∈ Bn and Un+1 ⊂ Un,

n = 1, 2, . . . then ∩nUn 6= ∅.

It is easily seen that complete metric spaces and

locally compact Hausdorﬀ spaces are pseudo-complete. The cartesian product of

any family of pseudo-complete spaces is pseudo-complete, see [18, Theorem 6]. Any

pseudo-complete-space is a Baire space, see [18, 5.1].

Proposition A.2. Suppose that the base space T is pseudo-complete and locally

paracompact. Then E is a Baire space.

Proof. Let {Bn} be sequence of pseudo-bases of T as in the deﬁnition of the pseudo-

completeness. Let {Gn} be a sequence of open dense subsets of E and G an open

subset of E. By the assumption of local paracompactness of T and [4, p. 10] there

are an open subset V1 of T , a section ϕ1 of ξ over V1, and a number ε1, 0 < ε1 < 2−1,

such that

U1 := {x ∈ E | p(x) ∈ V1, kx − ϕ1(p(x))k ≤ ε1} ⊂ G ∩ G1.

From the assumption of pseudo-completeness of T we infer that there exists W1 ∈ B1

such that W1 ⊂ W1 ⊂ V1. Now there are an open subset V2 ⊂ W1 of T , a section
ϕ2 of ξ over V2 ⊂ W1, and a number ε2, 0 < ε2 < 2−2, such that

U2 := {x ∈ E | p(x) ∈ V2, kx − ϕ2(p(x))k ≤ ε2} ⊂ U1 ∩ G2.

There exists W2 ∈ B2 such that W2 ⊂ W2 ⊂ V2. An obvious induction process

shows that for every natural number n ≥ 2 there exist an open subset Vn ⊂ Wn−1
of T , a section ϕn of ξ over Vn, and a number εn, 0 < εn < 2−n, such that

Un := {x ∈ E | p(x) ∈ Vn, kx − ϕn(p(x))k ≤ εn} ⊂ Un−1 ∩ Gn

and there exists Wn ∈ Bn such that Wn ⊂ Wn ⊂ Vn.

We have ∩∞

n=1Vn = ∩∞

n=1Wn 6= ∅. Pick t0 ∈ ∩nVn. From {ϕn(t0) − ϕn−1(t0)k ≤
εn−1 < 2n−1 we infer that {ϕn(t0)} is a Cauchy sequence in the Banach space
p−1(t0); it converges to a point x0 in this space. The inequality kx0 − ϕn(t0)k ≤ εn,
n = 1, 2, . . ., shows that x0 ∈ ∩∞

n=1 Gn and the proof is complete.

n=1Un ⊂ G ∩T∞

We have seen in Propositions 3.9 and 3.12 that it is of interest to know if a

given Banach bundle has a paracompact bundle space. We turn now to examining

some cases when E is paracompact or metrizable. Suppose ξ is a uniform Banach

bundle.Then, as remarked above in the paragraph preceding Example 5.4, there

exists a Banach space X such that E is a closed subset of T × X. If T is regular

and σ − compact or paracompact and perfectly normal then T × X is paracompact

by [15, Propositions 4 and 5]. Hence in these cases E is paracompact by [5, p.

218]. With some more work one can obtain the same conclusion when ξ is a locally

uniform Banach bundle. Indeed, let {Tα} be a family of closed subsets of T such

that {Int(Tα)} is an open cover of T with non-void subsets and the restriction of

ξ to each Tα is a uniform Banach bundle.

In both cases mentioned above T is

paracompact so we may suppose that the family of sets {Tα} is locally ﬁnite. Each
Tα inherits the properties of T we consider so each p−1(Tα) is paracompact. But
{p−1(Tα)} is a locally ﬁnite closed cover of E so E is paracompact.

Now if ξ is a uniform Banach bundle with a metrizable base space T then E is

metrizable by being a subset of a metrizable cartesian product. Again this remains

true for a locally uniform Banach bundle ξ. If {Tα} is a locally ﬁnite closed cover
of T as in the previous paragraph then {p−1(Tα)} is a locally ﬁnite closed cover of

E with metrizable subspaces. Then a result of Nagata, see [5, p. 204], implies that

E is metrizable.

Proposition A.3. Let ξ be a continuous Banach bundle with a regular base space

T that has a countable base. Moreover, suppose that the Banach space Γb(ξ) is

separable. Then E is regular and has a countable base.

Proof. Remark ﬁrst that T is a metrizable space therefore, by Proposition A.1, E

is completely regular. Now, say that {Vm} is a countable base of T and {ϕn} is a

34

sequence dense in Γb(ξ). For m, n, k ∈ N denote

U(m, n, k) := {x ∈ E | p(x) ∈ Vm, kx − ϕn(p(x))k < 1/k.

We shall show that {U(m, n, k)} is a base of E. Let U ⊂ E be open and x0 ∈ U .

The Banach bundle ξ is full so by [4, p. 10] there exist m ∈ N, ϕ ∈ Γb(ξ), and δ > 0

such that p(x0) ∈ Vm, ϕ(p(x0) = x0, and

U ′ := {x ∈ E | p(x) ∈ Vm, kx − ϕ(p(x))k < δ} ⊂ U.

Choose k ∈ N such that 1/k < δ/2 and ϕn such that kϕ − ϕnk < 1/k. It is now
routine to check that x0 ∈ U ′ ⊂ U(m, n, k).
