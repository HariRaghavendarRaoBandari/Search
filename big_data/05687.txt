Understanding how galaxies form in the early universe and their subsequent evolution through
cosmic time is a major goal of modern astrophysics. Panchromatic look-back sky surveys sig-
niﬁcantly advanced the ﬁeld in the past decades, and we are now entering an even more fruitful
period - a ’golden age’ of radio astronomy - with upgraded, and new facilities delivering an order
of magnitude increase in sensitivity. An overview of recent developments in radio continuum sky
surveys, focusing on the physical properties and cosmic evolution of radio AGN since z ∼ 5 is
presented here.

Radio AGN and their cosmic evolution

Vernesa Smolˇci´c

1. Introduction

Understanding how galaxies form in the early universe and their subsequent evolution through
cosmic time is a major goal of modern astrophysics. This ﬁeld has been signiﬁcantly advanced
in the past decade by panchromatic look-back sky surveys. The results of these, in synergy with
those based on theoretical and numerical studies led towards a picture of galaxy evolution in which
blue star forming galaxies with spiral morphology evolve over time towards quiescent red galaxies
with spheroidal morphologies and the highest stellar masses (e.g., Faber et al. 2007). A galaxy
evolves through interspersed episodes of intense mass accretion onto the stellar body, as well as
the central super-massive black hole (SMBH), creating a powerful active galactic nucleus (AGN;
Sanders & Mirabel 1996). In this context, understanding radio luminous AGN and their evolution
through cosmic time is highly important. The radio outﬂows of such AGN are by now regularly
taken in cosmological models as key to limit the growth of stellar mass in galaxies (so-called radio-
mode feedback; Granato et al. 2004; Bower et al. 2006; Croton et al. 2006). They are assumed
to heat the gas within the galaxy and thereby prevent further star formation (SF), and thus further
growth of the galaxy’s stellar body. This allows the models to reproduce the observational results at
the high-mass end, solving a long-standing problem in cosmological models of overpredicting the
volume densities of the most massive galaxies in the Universe (e.g., Somerville & Primack 1999).
However, to-date, it is still unclear whether such a process indeed occurs in nature with the assumed
impact, further motivating studies of the properties of radio AGN, their cosmic evolution, impact
on environment and role in galaxy formation and evolution (e.g., Hickox et al. 2009; Smolˇci´c et al.
2015; Godfrey & Shabala 2016).

Numerous past studies have revealed that radio AGN predominantly appear as two types.
However, various different classiﬁcation schemes of radio AGN, based on their observational prop-
erties have been suggested and applied onto radio AGN in the literature. These are based on e.g.
radio morphology and luminosity – FR I vs. FR II (Fanaroff & Riley 1974; Ledlow & Owen 1996),
radio loudness – radio-loud vs. radio-quiet AGN (e.g., Ivezi´c et al. 2002, Balokovi´c et al. 2011), ra-
dio spectrum – steep vs. ﬂat-spectrum sources (e.g., Dunlop & Peacock 1990), or optical emission
line properties – low-excitation vs. high-excitation radio AGN (Hine & Longair 1979; Laing et al.
1994) or, alternatively Seyferts, and quasars vs. LINERs and absorption line galaxies (e.g., Smolˇci´c
2009). In the last decade the community has converged towards the last classiﬁcation scheme due
to a rise of evidence supporting the idea that low- and high-excitation radio AGN (hereafter LER-
AGN and HERAGN, respectively) reﬂect fundamental physical differences, i.e., different modes
of SMBH accretion, as well as differences in physical properties of their host galaxies. Hence,
hereafter, the classiﬁcation, properties and cosmic evolution of radio AGN will be analyzed and
discussed in the context of LERAGN and HERAGN.

Signiﬁcant advancements have been made in understanding the properties of radio AGN in the
local (z < 0.3) Universe thanks to radio continuum surveys combined with surveys at other wave-
lengths. With the onset of upgraded facilities, these studies can be expanded to high redshift, al-
lowing for the ﬁrst determinations of the cosmic evolution of LERAGN- and HERAGN-dominated
samples, and setting the path for future projects planned with the upgraded and new facilities, such
as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and its precursors. This is summarized in Fig. 1 where past,
current, and future centimeter radio continuum surveys are put in context in terms of sensitivity

vs. area. While previous surveys ranged from shallow surveys of thousands of square degrees on
the sky (e.g., FIRST, NVSS, SUMMS; Becker et al. 1995; Condon et al. 1998; Bock et al. 1999)
to the deepest surveys, but of single pointings only (e.g., Deep-SWIRE, Owen & Morrison 2008),
for the same areas next generation surveys will push the limits in sensitivity by multiple orders of
magnitude (e.g., SKA1 Deep and All Sky surveys; Prandoni et al. 2015). The trend of increasing
sensitivity with new, intermediate- and wide-area surveys is also shown in Fig. 1 in the context of
radio luminosity vs. redshift. Various galaxy populations that can be identiﬁed in these surveys in
combination with multi-wavelength data are also shown. This illustrates that these surveys will be
able to generate statistically-signiﬁcant samples of the faintest radio sources, such as faint AGN
and SF galaxies, out to the highest redshifts. For example, an AGN with L1.4GHz ≈ 1024 W Hz−1 is
detectable in the large-area shallow surveys (SDSS/NVSS/SUMSS) out to z . 0.5. This limit was
pushed by e.g. the 2 square degree VLA-COSMOS 1.4GHz Large Project (Schinnerer et al. 2007)
to a limit of z . 2, while the current VLA-COSMOS 3GHz Large Project (Smolˇci´c et al., in prep)
extended this to z . 3.5.

In summary, in synergy with good multi-wavelength coverage current radio surveys are prob-
ing statistically signiﬁcant samples of fainter and higher-redshift radio sources than possible with
previous surveys linking past and future surveys in terms of sensitivity vs. area. This will allow for
new insights into the properties and cosmic evolution of LERAGN and HERAGN out to redshifts
of ∼ 5. Our current understanding of these is summarized below. In Sect. 2 various classiﬁcations
of radio AGN are presented. In Sect. 3 and Sect. 4 the properties of low- and high-redshift LE-
and HERAGN, and their cosmic evolution are described, respectively. A summary and outlook is
presented in Sect. 5.

2. Classiﬁcation of radio AGN

The classiﬁcation of radio AGN into HE- and LERAGN has been proposed by Hine & Longair
(1979). It is based on the existence of high-excitation (HE) emission lines in the optical spectra of
their host galaxies (Hine & Longair 1979; Laing et al. 1994). In this scheme, objects without high-
excitation emission lines are referred to as low-excitation radio galaxies. In the context of one of the
most commonly found separation of radio AGN in the literature, that into quasars, Seyfert, LINER,
and absorption line galaxies (see Fig. 2; Baldwin et al. 1981; Kauffmann et al. 2003; Kewley
et al. 2001, 2006), quasars and Seyferts would belong to the HERAGN category, while LINERs
and absorption line galaxies would occupy the LERAGN class. Compared to the morphological
classiﬁcation of radio AGN into FR I and II radio galaxies (Fanaroff & Riley 1974; Ledlow & Owen
1996), almost all FR I radio galaxies are LERAGN, while optical hosts of the most powerful radio
sources, i.e., FR IIs, usually have strong emission lines, and would, thus, be classiﬁed as HERAGN.
However, the correspondence between the FR class and the presence of emission lines is not one-to-
one as many FR II galaxies have been found to be LERAGN (e.g., Evans et al. 2006). Comparing
the HE-/LERAGN classiﬁcation scheme with radio AGN separated into radio-loud and radio-quiet
AGN is more complicated given the various deﬁnitions of radio loudness in the literature (see
Balokovi´c et al. 2011 for a summary and parametrization of the most common radio-loudness
deﬁnitions). If radio loudness is deﬁned solely based on radio luminosity then radio-loud (radio-
quiet) AGN samples would be dominated by HERAGN (LERAGN). However, for a deﬁnition of

redshift with various survey limits and galaxy populations indicated.

radio loudness taken as the ratio of radio to optical or (near-, mid-, far-, or monochromatic-) IR
luminosity, the reverse situation would occur. Radio-loud (radio-quiet) AGN would be roughly
consistent with the properties of LERAGN (HERAGN; see e.g., Bonzini et al. 2013 and Padovani
et al. 2015 for more details).

Using optical spectroscopic diagnostic tools to classify radio AGN into samples dominated by
LERAGN or HERAGN is possible out to z ∼ 1, beyond which one has to rely on multi-wavelength
proxies. This is due to a combination of i) the relevant emission lines dropping-out of the wave-
length range for a typically observed optical spectrum, and ii) the lack of complete spectroscopic
coverage of deep photometric surveys (such as e.g. COSMOS, Scoville et al. 2007) as they sam-
ple up to millions of galaxies down to AB magnitudes fainter than 26, rendering a spectroscopic
follow-up of all sources impossible. Such surveys, however, usually contain excellent (X-ray to
radio) multi-wavelength coverage which allows selecting radiatively efﬁcient AGN (i.e., HERG-
dominated samples) using X-ray and IR data (e.g. Brusa et al. 2007; Donley et al. 2013), and
radio-loud AGN (i.e. LERG dominated samples) as outliers in the IR-radio correlation (e.g. Con-
don 1992; Bonzini et al. 2013; Delvecchio et al., in prep.). Furthermore, ﬁtting the densely covered
optical to IR spectral energy distribution (SED) of sources using sophisticated spectral libraries al-
lows to approach the separation via i) rest-frame colors which have been shown to correlate with
the position of a galaxy in the spectroscopic diagnostics diagram (e.g. Baldwin et al. 1981; Smolˇci´c

et al. 2006, 2008), and/or ii) SED ﬁtting using both galaxy and AGN templates and, thereby, identi-
fying sources with substantial AGN contribution, as well as determining the fractional contribution
of the AGN to the galaxies’ bolometric luminosity (Delvecchio et al. 2014, in prep).

In summary, in the literature radio sources drawn from large-area, but shallow radio surveys
(e.g., NVSS, FIRST) are usually combined with large, and complete spectroscopic surveys (e.g.,
SDSS, 2dF, GAMA, see e.g., Smolˇci´c 2009; Sadler et al. 2003; Prescott et al. 2016) and, thus,
separated into star forming and AGN galaxies based on optical spectroscopic diagnostic tools (e.g.,
Best et al. 2005; Sadler et al. 2002; Donoso et al. 2009; Smolˇci´c 2009), reaching out to z ∼ 1. On the
other hand, radio sources drawn from intermediate- and small-area, but deeper radio surveys (e.g.,
COSMOS, E-CDFS; Schinnerer et al. 2007; Smolˇci´c et al., in prep.; Miller et al. 2008, 2013) are
usually separated using multi-wavelength data as proxies for SF- and AGN-related processes (e.g.,
Smolˇci´c et al. 2008, Bonzini et al. 2013, Padovani et al. 2015, Baran et al., in prep; Delvecchio et
al., in prep), and currently reach out to z ∼ 5.

3. Properties of radio AGN

3.1 Low redshift

To investigate the principal differences in physical properties of LERAGN and HERAGN
Smolˇci´c (2009) used a uniﬁed catalog of radio objects detected by NVSS, FIRST, WENSS, GB6,
and SDSS (Kimball & Ivezi´c 2008). They augmented this catalog with derivations of emission-line
ﬂuxes, 4000 Å breaks, stellar masses, and stellar velocity dispersions, drawn from the SDSS DR4
"main" spectroscopic sample (see Smolˇci´c 2009 and references therein), and further limited it to
unique objects that have been detected by both the FIRST and NVSS surveys at 20 cm and with
redshifts 0.04 < z < 0.1. Separating the objects into Seyfert, LINER, and absorption line systems

based on their spectroscopic emission line properties (see previous section, and Fig. 2), they found
a clear dichotomy between the properties of low-excitation (absorption line AGN and LINERs) and
high-excitation (Seyferts) radio AGN. This is summarized in Fig. 3 where the distributions of host
galaxy color, 4000 Å break strength, stellar mass, as well as proxies for the SMBH mass and accre-
tion rate are shown for the various AGN populations. In summary, they ﬁnd that hosts of LERAGN
have the highest stellar masses, reddest optical colors, and highest mass black holes but accrete ra-
diatively inefﬁciently, and at low accretion rates. On the other hand, the high-excitation radio AGN
have lower stellar masses, bluer optical colors (consistent with the "green valley"), and lower mass
black holes that accrete radiatively efﬁciently, and at high (∼ Eddington) accretion rates. Note
that Best & Heckman (2012) ﬁnd consistent results using a similar sample of FIRST-NVSS-SDSS
galaxies, separated into HERAGN and LERAGN. The dichotomy between the two AGN popu-
lations can be summarized in the galaxy color vs. stellar mass plane, as shown in Fig. 4. In the
local universe LERAGN occupy the red sequence of galaxies, while HERAGN populate the green
valley. This is also consistent with a systematic difference found for average gas masses within the
host galaxies of the two AGN populations. Smolˇci´c & Riechers (2011) performed CO(1→0) ob-
servations with the CARMA interferometer towards 11 z < 0.1 radio AGN drawn from the 3CRR
catalog (Laing et al. 1983; Ewans et al. 2006), and separated into LERAGN and HERAGN based
on their spectroscopic emission line properties (Buttiglione et al. 2009). Combining these results
with literature values they derived molecular gas masses (or upper limits) for a complete sample
of 21 z < 0.1 radio AGN, ﬁnding, on average, a factor of ∼ 7 higher gas masses within the host
galaxies of HERAGN, compared to LERAGN.

In the context of the blue-to-red galaxy evolution scenario the above described results imply
that HERAGN occur in an earlier stage of galaxy evolution relative to LERAGN. Furthermore,
HERAGN are hosted by galaxies with intrinsically higher SF rates (occupying the green valley)
than LERAGN (occupying the red sequence). Hence, as, in general, radio emission in the observed
(cm) band predominantly arises from synchrotron emission in galaxies caused either by SF- (super-
novae explosions) or AGN-related processes (see Condon 1992 for a review), this naturally leads
to the question about the real source of the observed radio emission in HERAGN and LERAGN.
Note that the selection of these two AGN types is based on their optical emission line properties
indicating either the existence or lack of a radiatively efﬁcient AGN powerful enough to excite the
given emission lines. However, even if a powerful AGN is identiﬁed this way its observed emis-
sion in the radio band may not necessarily fully arise from the AGN. If the host galaxy is forming
stars at a substantial rate this will, per-deﬁnition, contribute to the observed radio emission of the
source, rendering the radio emission a mix of SF- and AGN-induced radiation. Mori´c et al. (2010)
have inferred the statistical fractional contribution of SF- and AGN-related processes contributing
to the observed radio emission in HERAGN and LERAGN using a sample of SDSS-NVSS-IRAS
galaxies at 0.04 < z . 0.2, separated into Seyfert, LINERs, and absorption line galaxies based on
their spectroscopic line properties. They derived this quantity by assessing the average offset from
the IR-radio correlation (well-known to ﬁrmly hold for SF galaxies; e.g., Condon 1992) for a spe-
ciﬁc AGN/galaxy population (see Mori´c et al. 2010 for details). They ﬁnd that, statistically, about
60% of the radio emission in HERAGN arises from SF-, rather than AGN-related processes, while
for LERAGN only about 10% of the radio emission accounts for SF-related processes (see also
Gürkan et al. 2015, Hardcastle et al. 2013). Note that for the more powerful radiatively efﬁcient

6

AGN – quasars – the source of radio emission in radio-quiet quasars is still debated (see Kimball
et al 2011; Condon et al. 2013, White et al. 2015).

Lastly, the local radio luminosity functions derived separately for HERAGN and LERAGN
have been presented in e.g. Filho et al. (2006), Best & Heckman (2012), Gendre et al. (2013), Pracy
et al. (2015; in prep). While it is clear that HERAGN dominate the volume densities at high radio
luminosities (L1.4GHz > 1026 W Hz−1; Best & Heckman 2012), the slope of the low-luminosity
end of the HERAGN radio luminosity function is still unclear (e.g., Best & Heckman 2012 ﬁnd a
signiﬁcantly ﬂatter slope than Filho et al. 2006; see also Pracy et al., in prep; Padovani et al. 2015).
This is most likely due to the difﬁculty of disentangling the real contribution of AGN-related radio
emission in HERAGN.

In summary, in the local universe fundamental physical differences have been found between
LERAGN and HERAGN. LERAGN occupy the red sequence of galaxies, they are hosted by the
highest stellar mass galaxies, and contain the most massive SMBHs accreting at low, sub-Eddington
rates in a radiatively inefﬁcient manner (consistent with accretion dominated advection ﬂows –
ADAFs), and they are predominant at lower radio luminosities (L1.4GHz < 1026 W Hz−1). On
the other hand, HERAGN ccupy the green valley of galaxies, they are hosted by less massive
galaxies, and contain less massive SMBHs, but accrete at high, Eddington rates in an radiatively
efﬁcient manner (consistent with a thin-disk geometry), and they are predominant at higher radio
luminosities (L1.4GHz > 1026 W Hz−1).

3.2 High redshift

Investigating physical properties of HERAGN- and LERAGN-dominated samples in the high
redshift universe (z > 1) is the focus of current studies. Detailed studies of this kind were enabled
only recently with the advent of deep radio continuum surveys with excellent multi-wavelength
coverage allowing robust separations of radio AGN into various galaxy populations, but also cov-
ering enough area to allow construction of statistically signiﬁcant samples of distinct types of radio
AGN, divided in bins of various properties such as redshift, stellar mass, (speciﬁc) SF rate etc.

Bonzini et al. (2015) studied SF properties of ∼ 800 radio sources drawn from the E-CDFS
survey at 1.4GHz (0.3 deg.2, ﬂux density limit of 32.5 m Jy at the ﬁeld center; Miller et al. 2008,
2013), separated into SF, radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN (Bonzini et al. 2013). As discussed in
Bonzini et al. (2013) and Padovani et al. (2015) their sample of radio-quiet AGN is expected to be
dominated by HERAGN, while their radio-loud AGN sample is expected to predominantly contain
LERAGN. Bonzini et al. (2015) ﬁnd that the radio luminosity of their radio-quiet AGN (z ∼ 1.5 −2)
is consistent with the galaxies’ SF rates inferred using their FIR luminosites. The ﬁrst results based
on the VLA-COSMOS 3GHz Large Project (2.6 sq.degs.; rms = 2.3 m Jy/beam; ∼ 11,000 source
components, Smolˇci´c et al., in prep.) are consistent with this. These studies (Delhaize et al., in
prep; Delveccio et al., in prep.) rely on a sample of ∼ 1,500 radiatively efﬁcient AGN (z < 5;
drawn from the survey and cross-correlated with the COSMOS multi-wavelength data set; Baran
et al., in prep), which were identiﬁed using their X-ray emission (LX > 1042 erg/s; Civano et al.,
subm.), IR colors (using the criteria deﬁned by Donley et al. 2008), and SED ﬁtted properties
(using both galaxy and AGN templates; see Delvecchio et al. 2014 for details). Performing a
similar analysis as that presented in Mori´c et al. (2010; see previous Section), Delhaize et al. (in
prep.) infer that a substantial fraction of the radio emission in HERAGN (z < 5) may arise from

SF-related, rather than AGN-related processes. This is consistent with the SED properties of this
sample as inferred by Delvecchio et al. (in prep), who however also ﬁnd that about 35% of HERGs
show a > 3s
radio-excess compared to the IR-based SF rate. Delvecchio et al. (in prep.) further
investigate the physical properties of radiatively efﬁcient AGN (HERAGN-dominated), as well as
radiatively inefﬁcient AGN (LERAGN-dominated) deﬁned as those galaxies that have not been
selected using the X-ray, IR, and SED criteria (as deﬁned above), but exhibit an offset in radio
luminosity relative to that expected based on the SF rate inferred in the host galaxies via their
IR emission. They ﬁnd that, relative to those of HERAGN, the distributions of stellar mass and
speciﬁc SF rates of LERAGN are, respectively, skewed towards higher and lower, values out to
z ∼ 1. Beyond this redshift the distributions appear to become similar, suggesting a change in host
galaxy properties at these higher redshifts.

In summary, evidence has been found supporting that the radio emission in HERAGN dom-

inated samples (X-ray-, IR-, and SED-selected AGN) substantially arises from SF processes at
high (z > 1) redshift, consistent with the ﬁndings for low-redshift HERAGN (see previous Sec-
tion). Studies of the physical properties of the various radio AGN populations, and their potential
dichotomy across cosmic time are underway.

4. Evolution of radio AGN

Past studies have shown that radio luminous AGN evolve via a "down-sizing" effect, i.e. low-
luminosity sources evolve less strongly than high-luminosity sources (e.g., Willott et al. 2001;
Rigby et al. 2015). Studies of high-luminosity radio AGN (L1.4GHz & 2 × 1026 W Hz−1; Dunlop &
Peacock 1990; Willott et al. 2001) have found a strong positive density evolution at z . 2, beyond
which their comoving volume density declines. A substantially slower evolution of this population,
with a lower redshift (z ∼ 1 − 1.5) comoving volume density turnover, has been found for lower-
luminosity radio AGN (L1.4GHz > 2 × 1025 W Hz−1; Waddington et al. 2001). Studies of even
lower luminosity radio AGN (L1.4GHz . 1025 W Hz−1) ﬁnd a mild evolution out to z ∼ 1 (e.g.,
Smolˇci´c et al. 2009). Combining these results in context of the cosmic evolution of radio AGN
samples dominated by HERAGN and LERAGN suggests a much stronger cosmic evolution of the
ﬁrst compared to the latter, as illustrated in Fig. 5. Direct measurements of the cosmic evolution of
HERAGN and LERAGN, separated based on spectroscopic emission line properties out to z ∼ 1 are
in qualitative agreement with these results (Sadler et al. 2007; Donoso et al 2009; Best et al. 2014).
Expanding this to higher redshifts Padovani et al. (2015) have constrained the cosmic evolution of
their radio-loud (LERAGN-dominated) and radio-quiet (HERAGN-dominated) AGN identiﬁed in

the E-CDFS survey out to z ∼ 4 based on a sample of ∼ 300 radio AGN. While they ﬁnd a strong
evolution (similar to that for SF galaxies) of the ﬁrst sample throughout the redshift space probed,
they ﬁnd that the number density of the second peaks at z ∼ 0.5, and declines at higher redshifts.

5. Summary and outlook

A dichotomy reﬂecting fundamental physical differences between low- and high- excitation
radio AGN has been shown to exist in the local Universe. This is summarized in Fig. 6, and relates
to stellar, gas and SMBH mass, accretion rate and mode, cosmic evolution, as well as the source of
radio emission. Evidence has been found in support of the observed radio emission in HERAGN
substantially arising from star-formation, rather than AGN-related processes, both in the local and
high-redshift Universe. While numerous studies have focused, and converged on many properties
of low-redshift HE- and LERAGN, the physical properties of such sources at higher redshifts are
the focus of current studies. This is enabled by current radio continuum surveys probing to-date
the faintest levels, in conjunction with excellent multi-wavelength coverage. The results of these
will set the path for planned surveys, such as those with the SKA and its precursors.
