Chaotic dynamics of a bouncing coin

Ki Yeun Kim

Abstract

We study the dynamics of a bouncing coin whose motion is restricted to the two-dimensional
plane. Such coin model is equivalent to the system of two equal masses connected by a rigid rod,
making elastic collisions with a ﬂat boundary. We ﬁrst describe the coin system as a point billiard
with a scattering boundary. Then we analytically verify that the billiard map acting on the two
disjoint sets produces a Smale horseshoe structure. We also prove that any random sequence of
coin collisions can be realized by choosing an appropriate initial condition.

1 Introduction

A coin toss is often used as a method for choosing randomly between two options. It is also a familiar
model of a random outcome when learning probability and statistics. However, the motion of a tossed
coin is completely deterministic, meaning that given the set of initial conditions we can calculate the
exact outcome using the laws of physics. Various literature on the dynamics of a coin explore these
conﬂicting ideas.

In 1986, Keller studied an ideal two-dimensional coin: a thin disk whose rotation axis is parallel to
the ﬂoor. He proved that for a two-dimensional coin tossed and caught in hand before a collision, the
probability of getting either heads or tails approaches .5 in the limit of possible initial velocities [Ke].
Diaconis, Holmes, and Montgomery showed that a three-dimensional coin, a disk with no restriction
on its rotation axis, is slightly biased by .01 to land on the side it was held at the initial position [Di]. If
we allow the coin to bounce on the ﬂoor, the analysis of the qualitative behavior of the coin gets highly
nontrivial. Vulovic and Prange carried out computer simulation to prove that a small perturbation of
the initial velocities of a two-dimensional bouncing coin can lead to very different outcomes [Vu].
Strzalko et al. published a similar numerical result for a three-dimensional coin [Str].

Another motivation for studying a coin comes from the billiards theory. In the 1960s, the billiard
problem appeared in the context of statistical mechanics to study a system of spherical gas particles
in a box to verify the Boltzmann ergodic hypothesis [Si]. More recently, non-spherical particles,

1

which have rotational in addition to translational velocities, were studied to build a more realistic
gas model [Co]. In this direction, it became natural to consider the behavior of “a billiard ball with
two degrees of freedom” [Ba]. Before understanding the full dynamics of a two-dimensional billiard
object moving in some general planar domains, we study the object interacting with a simple ﬂat
boundary.

We consider an object consisting of two equal masses connected by a weightless rigid rod (Figure
3a). We assume the object moves under the inﬂuence of gravity and makes elastic collisions at the
ﬂat boundary. Note that this system can be viewed as an equivalent model to a system of a two-
dimensional bouncing coin. We use this coin model since it gives us relatively convenient constants
for our analysis. Using a different two-dimensional coin model such as an actual thin disk (the
aforementioned Keller model) or a rod will not change the main results in this paper. In that case, we
will only need to modify the moment of inertia of the system and a few other related constants.

In this paper, we analytically prove the existence of a chaotic behavior of this two-dimensional
coin model. Unlike a realistic situation where a coin eventually rests, our coin does not stop bouncing.
Therefore, we cannot discuss the randomness based on its ﬁnal position. Instead, we study the inﬁnite
sequence of coin bounces. We prove that the two-dimensional bouncing coin can produce any inﬁnite
sequence of collisions. In this sense, we may consider the two-dimensional coin with collisions a
good randomizer.

Theorem 1.1. Consider a two-dimensional coin consisting of two equal masses mL and mR con-
nected by a weightless rod in the XY plane (Figure 3a). Suppose the coin moves in Y > 0 under
the inﬂuence of gravity g, and makes elastic collisions at Y = 0. If a collision of mL or mR is
labeled by L or R, then any inﬁnite collision sequence of L’s and R’s can be realized by choosing an
appropriate initial condition.

In order to prove the theorem, we consider the coin system as a point billiard. On the conﬁguration
space of the coin, the coin reduces to a mass point moving in a domain with a scattering boundary
(Figure 3b). Then we show that a Smale horseshoe [Sm] is embedded in the billiard map ˜f. Once
we have a horseshoe, we will use the fact that the horseshoe map creates one-to-one correspondence
between an inﬁnitely long symbolic sequence to a phase point to complete the proof.

One way to verify that a certain map contains a horseshoe is by showing that the map satisﬁes
the Conley-Moser conditions [Mo], which are a combination of geometric and analytic criteria. If
met, these conditions conﬁrm that the stable manifolds and the unstable manifolds of the invariant
set transversally intersect, which directly implies the existence of a horseshoe. In Section 4, we use
the coin billiard map ˜f to construct the horizontal and vertical strips satisfying the Conley-Moser
conditions.

Although there are many naturally occuring systems in science and engineering that are proven to
contain a horseshoe [Le, Ho], to the best of our knowledge, all the studied horseshoe maps are deﬁned
on one connected domain. For our coin system, we iterate ˜f on the union of two disjoint rectangles

by Hs where s ∈ S = {L1, L2, L3, R1, R2, R3}. If we iterate ˜f backward, then ˜f−1(eD) ∩ eD are the

each point in Λ, we assign a unique bi-inﬁnite sequence s = (...s−2s−1s0.s1s2...) where si ∈ S,
with some forbidden patterns in si’s arising from the overlapping nature of the strips. For exam-
ple, ˜f (HL1), ˜f (HL2) or ˜f (HL3) has a nonempty intersection with HR1, HL2 or HR3, but not with
HL1, HR2 or HL3. We deﬁne Σ be the set of bi-inﬁnite sequences of six symbols L1, L2, L3, R1, R2, R3
with the following rules (Figure 2):

3

• L1, L2, or L3 can precede R1, L2, or R3.
• R1, R2, or R3 can precede L1, R2, or L3.

We remark that if we set the representatives [L] = {L1, L2, L3} and [R] = {R1, R2, R3} and rewrite
sequences in Σ using [L]’s and [R]’s, then Σ contains all possible inﬁnite sequences generated by [L]
and [R]. It is easy to see that this implies Theorem 1.1.
The formal horseshoe construction is expressed as:

σ : Σ → Σ, then the diagram below commutes.

The plan of the paper is the following. We will introduce the coin model, and study its collision
dynamics in the language of billiards in Section 2. In Section 3, we recall necessary deﬁnitions and
state the Conley-Moser conditions. In Section 4, we study the topological picture of the billiard map.
The main construction of the horseshoe and the proofs of the main theorems will be presented in
Section 5.

The two-dimensional coin model we consider consists of two equal point masses mL and mR
connected by a weightless rigid rod of length l in the XY plane (Figure 3a). The coordinates of mL,

4

mR, and the center of mass of the coin are denoted by (XL, YL), (XR, YR), and (X, Y ), respectively.
Let θ ∈ R be the angular position of the normal vector of the coin measured counterclockwise from
the positive Y -direction.

Remark 2.1. Although the coin looks physically the same when θ = θ + 2πZ, we measure θ ∈ R
for now, keeping track of the rotation number. We will identify θ and θ + 2πZ as the same in the later
section.

We assume the coin moves under the inﬂuence of gravity g in the half space Y > 0 and reﬂects
elastically at the boundary Y = 0. The velocity of the center of mass in the X-direction is constant
since there is no force acting on the system in that direction. Thus, we may assume that the center of
mass does not move in the X-direction. With this reduction, the conﬁguration space of the coin is R2
with the (θ, Y ) coordinates.

On the θY plane, the coin is a mass point in a transformed domain. Note that the coin hits the ﬂoor

when YL or YR becomes zero. Therefore, using the relations

YL = Y −

we ﬁnd the domain on the θY plane {(θ, Y ) : Y ≥ l

Now we examine the motion of the coin. Let m = mL + mR be total mass of the coin. The

since in this way we can use the standard mirror-like reﬂection law. By the Hamilton’s principle of
least action, we know that the motion of the coin between two collisions on the θy plane is governed
by

¨θ = 0

¨y = −gr m

I

.

(2)

That is, the coin moves along a parabola between two collisions. We rescale the billiard domain
accordingly and get

Q = {(θ, y) : y ≥ | sin θ| for θ ∈ R}.

(3)

To simplify calculations, we choose m = 1, l = 2, thus I = 1. The results in this paper stay
true with different choices of numbers. As we mentioned in the introduction, we may also use a
different two-dimensional coin model and perform the same analysis. Different models will change
the moment of inertia of the system and a few other constants only.

5

At the boundary ∂Q, there will be a mirror-like reﬂection. We use the subscript − to denote the
values right before a collision and + to denote the values right after a collision. Recall that given
vectors v− and n, the reﬂection of v− across n is given by

v+ = −2

n + v−.

v− · n
n · n

In our case, n is the normal vector to the boundary ∂Q when θ 6= nπ, and v− is the incoming velocity

(4)

Using (2)-(4), we build a billiard for the coin system on the θy plane. In the domain Q on the
θy plane, we represent the motion of the coin as the billiard ﬂow in Q. The ﬂow is deﬁned by the
trajectory of the coin moving in a parabola until it reaches the boundary ∂Q and making a mirror-like
reﬂection at ∂Q. As in classical billiards, it is sufﬁcient to examine the ﬂow only at the moment of
collision. We choose to observe the ﬂow right before a collision. Thus, when there is no ambiguity,
we drop the subscript − to simplify our notation.

we deﬁne the return map f : P → P, which takes the data of a collision to the data of the next
collision. A phase point on P can be identiﬁed with (q, v) where q is the footpoint on the boundary
∂Q and v is the incoming velocity vector v at q. If we restrict our attention to the ﬂow pointing
“downwards” at the moment of collision,

Pd =n(q, v) : (q, v) ∈ P, v · ˆy < 0o,

(ˆy is a vector in the positive y direction)

then we can use (θ, ˙θ) as the coordinates on Pd. Combining (1) and (3), we check that (q, v) on Pd
can be represented in terms of (θ, ˙θ),

q = (θ,| sin θ|)

v =(cid:18) ˙θ,−q2E − 2g| sin θ| − ˙θ2(cid:19) .

(5)

When a point and its image under f are both on Pd, we write f (θ, ˙θ) = (θ1, ˙θ1). In general, given
(θ, ˙θ), we cannot solve for (θ1, ˙θ1). However, (θ1, ˙θ1) can be implicitly found in the following way.
First, we use (4) to write (θ+, ˙θ+) in terms of (θ, ˙θ),

θ+ = θ

Given (θ+, ˙θ+), we may use the basic laws of physics to determine the formula for the parabolic
trajectory y = α(θ − β)2 + γ deﬁned by (θ+, ˙θ+). We may do the same with (θ1, ˙θ1). Since (θ+, ˙θ+)
and (θ1, ˙θ1) should deﬁne the same parabolic trajectory, we obtain

Combining (6) and (7) lets us implicitly deﬁne (θ1, ˙θ1).

3 The Conley-Moser conditions

In this section, we review the Conley-Moser conditions [Mo, Wi], which guarantee the existence of a
horseshoe. We ﬁrst need some deﬁnitions. Let D = [X0, X1] × [Y0, Y1] ⊂ R2.
Deﬁnition. In D, a µh-horizontal curve is the graph of a function Y = h(X) such that

(1) Y0 ≤ h(X) ≤ Y1, and
(2) for every pair Xi, Xj ∈ [X0, X1], we have |h(Xi) − h(Xj )| ≤ µh|Xi − Xj| for some 0 ≤ µh.
Deﬁnition. In D, a µv-vertical curve is the graph of a function X = v(Y ) such that

(1) X0 ≤ v(Y ) ≤ X1, and
(2) for every pair Yi, Yj ∈ [Y0, Y1], we have |v(Yi) − v(Yj)| ≤ µv|Yi − Yj| for some 0 ≤ µv.
Deﬁnition. Given two non-intersecting horizontal curves h1(X) < h2(X) in D, we deﬁne a µh-
horizontal strip as

H = {(X, Y ) : Y ∈ [h1(X), h2(X)] for X ∈ [X0, X1]} .

Given two non-intersecting vertical curves v1(Y ) < v2(Y ) in D, we deﬁne a µv-vertical strip as

V = {(X, Y ) : Y ∈ [v1(Y ), v2(Y )]

for Y ∈ [Y0, Y1]} .

Deﬁnition. The width of horizontal strips is deﬁned as d(H) = max |h2(X)− h1(X)|, and the width
of vertical strips is deﬁned as d(V ) = max |v2(Y ) − v1(Y )|.
Consider a diffeomorphism F : D → R2 and let S = {1, 2, . . . N} be an index set. LetSs∈S Hs
be a set of disjoint µh-horizontal strips, and letSs∈S Vs be a set of disjoint µv-vertical strips. The

Conley-Moser conditions on F are:

7

CM1 0 ≤ µhµv < 1
CM2 F maps Vs homeomorphically onto Hs. Also, the horizontal (vertical) boundaries of Vs get

mapped to the horizontal (vertical) boundaries of Hs.

CM3 Suppose H is a µh-horizontal strip contained inSs∈S Hs, then F (H) ∩ Hs is a µh-horizontal
strip and d(F (H) ∩ Hs) < d(H). Similarly, if V is a µv-vertical strip contained inSs∈S Vi,
then F −1(V ) ∩ Vs is a µv-vertical strip and d(F −1(V ) ∩ Vs) < d(V ).

Theorem 3.1 (Moser). Suppose F satisﬁes the Conley-Moser conditions. Then F has an invariant
Cantor set Λ on which it is topologically conjugate to a full shift on N symbols, i.e.
the diagram
below commutes, where φ : Λ → ΣN is a homeomorphism and σ : ΣN → ΣN is the shift map on the
space of sequences of N symbols.

4 The topological picture of f

We will study the topological picture of the return map f which will be fundamental to constructing
the horizontal and vertical strips satisfying the Conley-Moser conditions. We start by choosing an
appropriate domain for f .

4.1 Construction of the domain D

We naturally want to pick a domain which contains the phase points corresponding to collisions of
mL and also the phase points corresponding to collisions of mR to study how the two parts interact.
From the construction of P, we see that the phase points (θ, ˙θ) for mL satisfy 2nπ < θ < (2n+1)π,
and the phase points for mR satisfy (2n−1)π < θ < 2nπ. Also, note that (θ, ˙θ) ∈ Pd is not
deﬁned when θ = nπ, since such points are associated to the billiard trajectories hitting the corners
of ∂Q = | sin θ|. Thus, our domain should not include any points with θ = nπ. To embrace both
conditions, it is apparent we must choose two disjoint subsets as a domain.
Suppose we choose two rectangles of width 2θ∗<π and height 2 ˙θ∗ centered at(cid:0) π
2 , 0(cid:1) and(cid:0) 3π
2 , 0(cid:1)

as the domain. As a ﬁrst step toward understanding the image of the rectangles, let us attempt to

8

calculate the image of one of the corner points,(cid:0) π

how ˙θ∗ changes right after the reﬂection. By (6),

2 − θ∗, ˙θ∗(cid:1). To ﬁnd its image, we ﬁrst need to know

˙θ∗+ =

1

1 + sin2 θ∗(cid:18)(1 − sin2 θ∗) ˙θ∗ − 2 sin θ∗q2E − 2g cos θ∗ − ( ˙θ∗)2(cid:19) .

We can imagine that using the exact form of this equation in the next steps will cause complicated
calculations. However, if θ∗ is small and ( ˙θ∗)2 is small compared to 2E, then we can estimate the θ∗
and ˙θ∗, thus the equation as well, using asymptotics.

E(cid:1) and ˙θ∗ = O(cid:0) 1√E(cid:1). We note
We assume the energy of the system E is large and set θ∗ = O(cid:0) 1
E(cid:1), we only consider the pieces of the boundary ∂Q “near” the sine
that, with the bound θ∗ = O(cid:0) 1
peaks. The restriction in ˙θ∗ implies that the angle between the incoming billiard trajectory and −ˆy
E(cid:1), i.e. the trajectory is “close to vertical”. Therefore, this setting
at the moment of a collision is O(cid:0) 1

guarantees that we will always have the transversal Poincar`e section.

Let D be the union of

DL =n(θ, ˙θ) : (θ, ˙θ) ∈ Pd,(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)θ −

where k is a function of E satisfying the equation (8) in Lemma 4.2 below, and k is bounded by two
independent constants 0 < k1 < k < k2.

Remark 4.1. We explain why we choose k(E) in this speciﬁc way. We claim that the k can be treated
as a bifurcation point for topological pictures of f .

1. If we instead use a constant K slightly smaller than k when deﬁning the domain D = D(K),
then f (D(K)) intersects D(K)±(2πZ, 0) in two horizontal strips and four corners (Figure 4a).
2. As K approaches k, f (D(K)) becomes wider and ﬂatter. When we use the exact k, then
f (D) ∩ (D±(2πZ, 0)) results in six horizontal strips as in Figure 4b. These six horizontal
strips are the “minimal” number of strips such that, later when we identify the angle of the coin
θ = θ + 2πZ, the image of each rectangle intersects itself “and” the other rectangle in full
horizontal strips (Figure 1).

3. With K slightly bigger than k, f (D(K)) still intersects in (D(K)±(2πZ, 0)) in six horizontal

strips as in the case of k, but it is more tedious to compute the coordinates of f (D(K)).

4. As K gets bigger, the topological picture of f (D(K)) changes from Figure 4b to Figure 4c.

4.2 The image of D under the return map f

We will use a few reference points in D and the Jacobian approximation of f to show that f (D) are
long and thin strips overlapping D and D±(2π, 0) as in Figure 5. Due to the symmetry of the coin,
f (DR) will have the same topological picture as f (DL), shifted by π. Therefore, we may focus on
the topological behavior of f (DL). We start by analyzing the image of the top edge of DL under f .

Lemma 4.4. The image of the top edge of DL under f is a µh-horizontal curve with µh = O(cid:0) 1√E(cid:1).

Proof. We ﬁrst compute the Jacobian Jf for general (θ, ˙θ), then estimate the transformation of a
vector (1, 0)T in DL by Jf . From (6), we get the derivatives

We plot the images of the three reference points f (a), f (b), and f (c) (Figure 5). Then by Lemma

Similarly, using symmetries, we infer that the image of the bottom edge of DL also crosses DL, DR
and DR−(2π, 0) horizontally. Since f is continuous and the proof of Lemma 4.4 can be applied
to any vector (1, 0)T lying in DL, we deduce that the image of DL is µh-horizontal strip crossing
DL, DR and DR−(2π, 0) horizontally. The same argument works for DR, and we conclude that
f (D) on D±(2πZ, 0) are six horizontal strips.

5 Construction of the strips satisfying the Conley-Moser conditions

In this section, we ﬁnally construct the horizontal and vertical strips satisfying the Conley-Moser
conditions using the coin billiard map. Recall that we measured the angular position of the coin
θ ∈ R distinguishing θ from θ + 2πZ. We now impose the equivalence relation θ ∼ θ + 2πZ and

treat θ = θ + 2πZ as the same. We denote the resultant objects withe, i.e. eQ,fPd, eD, ˜f.

5.1 The Conley-Moser conditions for the coin billiard map ˜f.

4.5 and Figure 5 that

We denote the six horizontal strips Hs where s ∈ S = {L1, L2, L3, R1, R2, R3} as illustrated in

Under this setting where θ ∈ S1, eDL and eDR lie on a cylinder. It directly follows from Proposition
Corollary 5.1. ˜f (eD) ∩ eD are six µh-horizontal strips with µh = O(cid:0) 1√E(cid:1) (Figure 1a).
Proposition 5.2. The preimages of Hs are six disjoint µv-vertical strips Vs ∈ eD with µv = O(cid:0) 1√E(cid:1).
of the top and the bottom edges of eDL. To ﬁnd the inverse image of the vertical boundaries of HL2,

Proof. Without loss of generality, we choose HL2 to ﬁnd its preimage. From the construction of the
horizontal strips Hs, the inverse images of the upper and lower boundary curves of HL2 are segments

we compute J ˜f −1(0, 1)T . By the inverse function theorem, J ˜f −1 = (J ˜f )−1. Since f and ˜f are locally
the same, we may use (11) and the equations in the proof of Lemma 4.4 to compute J ˜f −1. First, by
direct computation, we ﬁnd the determinant of J ˜f

.

|J ˜f| =

˙y ˙y+(1 + cos2 θ)( ˙y1 ∓ ˙θ1 cos θ1)
Using (10), we ﬁnd |J ˜f| = O(1) for the points in eDL. Thus,

To summarize, the preimages of the boundaries of HL2 consist of two segments of the top and the

bottom edges of eDL and two µv-vertical curves in eDL. Since ˜f−1 is a diffeomorphism, the boundaries

get mapped to the boundaries and the interior gets mapped to the interior. Therefore the inverse image
of a horizontal strip HL2 is a vertical strip.

Proposition 5.3.

1. Consider a µh-horizontal strip Hs for s ∈ {L1, L2, L3}. If j ∈ {R1, L2, R3}, then ˜f (Hs)∩ Hj
h = O(cid:0) 1√E(cid:1) and d( ˜f (Hs)∩Hj) < d(Hs). If j ∈ {L1, R2, L3},

then ˜f (Hs) ∩ Hj = ∅.

2. Similary, consider a µv-vertical strip Vs for s ∈ {R1, L2, R3}.

If j ∈ {L1, L2, L3}, then

v = O(cid:0) 1√E(cid:1) and d( ˜f−1(Vs) ∩ Vj) < d(Vs). If j ∈

˜f−1(Vs) ∩ Vj is a µ1

{R1, R2, R3}, then ˜f−1(Vs) ∩ Vj = ∅.

3. The statements 1 and 2 with L and R switched are also true.

Proof. We only prove the statement 1, since the proofs for the statements 2 and 3 are similar. By

observing the topological pictures of ˜f (eD) (Figure 1a, Figure 5), we can easily see that when s ∈
{L1, L2, L3} and j ∈ {L1, R2, L3}, we have ˜f (Hs)∩ Hj = ∅. If j ∈ {L1, R2, L3}, then ˜f (Hs)∩ Hj
is nonempty and is contained in Hj. It is clear d( ˜f (Hs) ∩ Hj) ≤ d(Hs). It remains to estimate the
maximal slope of the horizontal boundary curves of ˜f (Hs)∩ Hj. From Proposition 4.5, we know that
the horizontal boundary curves of Hs has the maximal slope µh = O(cid:0) 1√E(cid:1). Using (11), we get

(J ˜f )|D  1

)  =  O(E)
O(√E)! .
Thus, the maximal slope of the horizontal boundary curves of f (Hs)∩ Hj is µ1

O(√E) + O( 1√E

µh! =

h = O(√E)

O(E) = O(cid:0) 1√E(cid:1).

5.2 The proofs of Theorem 1.1 and 1.2

Corollary 5.1, Proposition 5.2, and Proposition 5.3 together imply that ˜f satisﬁes the modiﬁed Conley-
Moser conditions. Then Theorem 1.2* below is merely a version of Theorem 3.1. To state Theorem
1.2*, we need a few deﬁnitions.

Deﬁnition. Let Σ be the set of bi-inﬁnite sequences of six symbols L1, L2, L3, R1, R2, R3 with the
following rules:

• L1, L2, or L3 can precede R1, L2, or R3.
• R1, R2, or R3 can precede L1, R2, or L3.

Theorem 1.2*. There is a homeomorphism φ : Λ → Σ such that if we denote the shift map on Σ as
σ : Σ → Σ, then the diagram below commutes.

We ﬁrst describe the invariant set Λ: the set of points which stay in eD after inﬁnitely many forward
iteration of ˜f , the invariant set ˜f (eD)∩ eD consists of the 2· 3 horizontal strips Hs where s ∈ S. From
h = O(cid:0) 1√E(cid:1) in each Hs. In other words,

˜f (Hs−n...s−2) ∩ Hs−1 = Hs−n...s−1.

Similarly, from Propositions 5.2 and 5.3, we obtain 2 · 3n µ∗v-vertical strips with µn
invariant set for ˜f−n. The nested vertical strips are deﬁned

v -vertical strips. When
We see that ΛN is the intersection of 2·3N µN
N → ∞, we see that Λ is a Cantor set, the intersection of inﬁnite number of µ∗h-horizontal curves and
µ∗v-vertical curves. The ﬁrst Conley-Moser condition 0 < µhµv = O( 1√E(cid:1)O(cid:0) 1√E(cid:1) < 1 guarantees
The next step is to assign a sequence s = (...s−2s−1s0s1...) ∈ Σ to each point p ∈ Λ based on
to which horizontal curve H...s−2s−1 and vertical curve Vs0s1... the point p belongs. It is clear from
the construction that this assignment φ : Σ → Λ is one-to-one. Also, from Proposition 5.3, we know
that only certain choices of s, j for f (Hs) ∩ Hj = Hsj are valid. Thus, the sequences s ∈ Σ must
combinatorially follow the two rules mentioned on the previous page. The proof can be completed
by showing that φ is a homeomorphism. See [Mo, Wi] for the full details.

Theorem 1.1*. For the two-dimensional coin model, if a collision of mL or mR is labeled by L or
R respectively, then any inﬁnite sequence of L’s and R’s can be realized by choosing an appropriate
initial condition.

Proof. The sequence set Σ contains all the inﬁnite sequences of L1, L2, L3, R1, R2, R3’s which do
not violate the rules. From the rules, we see that if we set the representatives [L] = {L1, L2, L3} and

17

[R] = {R1, R2, R3}, then either [L] or [R] may follow after [L] (see also Figure 2). Similarly, after
[R], either [L] or [R] may follow. In other words, Σ contains all possible sequences of [L]’s and [R]’s.
By Theorem 1.2*, having all sequences of [L]’s and [R]’s implies that for any collision sequence
of L’s and R’s, there exists a phase point of the coin billiard which makes collisions according to the
sequence.
