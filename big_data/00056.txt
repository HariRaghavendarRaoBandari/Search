Modiﬁed theories of gravity provide us with a unique opportunity to generate innovative tests of
gravity. In Chameleon f (R) gravity, the gravitational potential diﬀers from the weak-ﬁeld limit of
general relativity (GR) in a mass dependent way. We develop a probe of gravity which compares
high mass clusters, where Chameleon eﬀects are weak, to low mass clusters, where the eﬀects can
be strong. We utilize the escape velocity edges in the radius/velocity phase space to infer the
gravitational potential proﬁles on scales of 0.3 - 1 virial radii. We show that the escape edges of
low mass clusters are enhanced compared to GR, where the magnitude of the diﬀerence depends on
the background ﬁeld value |fR0|. We validate our probe using N-body simulations and simulated
light cone galaxy data. For a DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) Bright Galaxy Sample,
including observational systematics, projection eﬀects, and cosmic variance, our test can diﬀerentiate
between GR and Chameleon f (R) gravity models, |fR0| = 4 × 10−6 (2 × 10−6) at > 5σ (> 2σ), more
than an order of magnitude better than current cluster-scale constraints.

INTRODUCTION

A variety of high precision observations all seem to
indicate that our universe is currently undergoing accel-
erated expansion [1, 2]. The most popular model that
is consistent with these observations deploys the frame-
work of General Relativity (GR) with an additional cos-
mological constant (Λ) that induces cosmic acceleration
at late times. However, the key theoretical component of
this concordant cosmological model, GR, is still poorly
tested on megaparsec scales. This has given way for the
proliferation of both novel ways of testing GR as well
as gravitational theories that modify GR in cosmological
scales (see [3, 4] for thorough reviews).

The main theoretical thrust behind models of modiﬁed
gravity (MG) is that while we know GR and its weak-ﬁeld
limit (Newtonian gravity) work exquisitely well at the
scales of binary pulsars and the solar system, we should
be cautious when extrapolating out to much larger (i.e.
cosmological) scales. For this reason, models of MG that
successfully reproduce late time cosmic acceleration on
large scales must also recover the predictions made by
GR on small scales.

To accomplish this, modiﬁed theories of gravity imple-
ment screening mechanisms that attenuate the eﬀect of
additional forces in high density regions. One such mech-
anism is the Chameleon mechanism whereby the addi-
tional ﬁfth force active in low density regions is screened
in regions of high density by shortening the range of in-
teraction of the ﬁeld [5, 6]. A more general approach
utilizes Eﬀective Field Theory (EFT) of cosmic accelera-

tion [7, 8], where recent theoretical advances have shown
that there exists a large model space that recovers an
accelerated expansion on large scales, while reducing to
Newtonian gravity on the small scales in linear theory
[9]. Thus, there is a need for well-deﬁned observational
tests which can distinguish the many models, including
their possible covariant nature, as well as ΛCDM.

In this paper, we present a novel test of gravity on
galaxy cluster scales that exploits how the Chameleon
mechanism modiﬁes the gravitational potential of clus-
ters of diﬀerent masses. Speciﬁcally, MG deepens the
potential in the outskirts of low mass galaxy clusters with
respect to GR, but leaves the potential of high mass clus-
ters relatively unaﬀected. By taking the average ratio
between the gravitational potential of high mass and low
mass galaxy clusters, we show that one can unambigu-
ously discern between Chameleon-like modiﬁed gravity
theories and GR.

We note that our proposed test is complementary to
probes of gravity on larger scales (1-10 Mpc) [10–13] and
can also act as a powerful cross-check of tests in galaxy
cluster scales (0.1-1h−1Mpc) [14–21]. However, our test
distinguishes itself in that it directly probes the grav-
itational potential and allows for a simple and elegant
incorporation of theoretical predictions.

We carry out our proposed test of gravity using syn-
thetic dark matter halos of cosmological N-body simula-
tions and test its viability by comparing results with ana-
lytic theory. We then utilize simulated galaxy catalogs to
incorporate realistic observational systematics, including
projection eﬀects. After vetting our theoretical predic-

tions with simulations, we show that our probe has the
potential to deliver more competitive cluster-scale con-
straints on Chameleon f(R) MGs than at present.

The paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II we review
the Hu-Sawicki f (R) gravity model and derive the the-
oretical expectations of our observable in both MG and
GR. In Sec. III we describe how we obtain our observ-
able from the phase space of galaxy clusters, and detail
how we do this in N-body simulations. A brief descrip-
tion of the N-body simulations we used is also provided.
Sec.
IV is devoted to putting together both our theo-
retical expectations and observables. More speciﬁcally,
we describe how our test probes gravity in the scale of
galaxy clusters. In Sec. V we address both theoretical
and observational systematics, whether or not they are
signiﬁcant as well as how we fold them into our ﬁnal
analysis. Finally, in Sec. VI we discuss both how our
probe can set competitive constraints on MG and, more
generally, can also act as a powerful test of GR in the
scale of galaxy clusters. We conclude in Sec. VII with
some remarks on how our probe will leverage the obser-
vational capacities of future large-scale photometric and
spectroscopic surveys.

II. THEORETICAL EXPECTATIONS

A. Hu-Sawicki f (R) gravity

In what follows we focus on a particular model of MG:
Chameleon Hu-Sawicki f(R) gravity [22]. In f(R) gravity,
the Einstein-Hilbert action is augmented by a free func-
tion of the Ricci scalar (R+f(R)). This modiﬁcation in-
troduces an additional degree of freedom which can be re-
cast as a non-minimally coupled scalar ﬁeld, fR ≡ df (R)
dR ,
dubbed the scalaron. The functional form of f (R) in the
Hu-Sawicki model is as follows:

f (R) = − ¯m2

c1(R/ ¯m2)n

c2(R/ ¯m2)n + 1

.

(1)

The ¯m parameter sets the mass scale and is given by
¯m2 = 8πG
3 ρm0, where ρm0 is the average density today.
As such, this model is determined by three dimensionless
free parameters: c1, c2 and n. The speciﬁc values of these
free parameters can be narrowed down to those which
produce expansion histories that are consistent with cur-
rent cosmological constraints. In particular, these three
parameters are related to the background value of the
scalaron today, fR0. For example, with ΩM = 0.24 and
ΩΛ = 0.76, we have that fR0 ≈ nc1/c2
2/(41)n+1 [22].
From now on, we parametrize these free parameters in
terms of fR0 and consider models that are phenomeno-
logically viable. We refer the reader to Hu and Sawicki
(2007) for the particularities of the model and the de-
tails of the calculations shown above. We ﬁx n = 1 and
consider only models with background ﬁeld values in the

2

present epoch of |fR0| = 10−5 and 10−6, which will be
denoted from now on as FR5 and FR6 respectively. Note
that in our deﬁnition of |fR0| we have set the the speed
of light to unity.

B. Gravitational potential

Naturally, as a coupled scalar ﬁeld, the eﬀect of the
scalaron is to mediate an additional ﬁfth force between
massive bodies. Thus, the gravitational potential which
massive particles experience is no longer the usual Newto-
nian dynamical potential of the Poisson equation (φGR),
but rather [23]:

φ(r) = φGR(r) −

1
2

δfR(r).

(2)

Here the δ signiﬁes that the background has been sub-
tracted from the scalaron ﬁeld: δfR = fR − fR.

The additional

scalar ﬁeld can be

shielded in
Chameleon Hu-Sawicki f (R) gravity in order to recover
the predictions made by GR in high density regions.
In the high density “Chameleon regime,” the screening
mechanism ensures we recover GR by making fR → 0.
As such, in this regime the scalaron’s ﬁeld value is:

δf cham

R

= −fR0.

(3)

The scalar ﬁeld is constant in high density regions (e.g.
in the core of galaxy clusters) and can mediate no ad-
ditional forces. Outside of the high density core, the
ﬁeld can propagate and mediate a ﬁfth force. The
range of this ﬁfth force is determined by Compton wave-
length of the ﬁeld, or the inverse mass of the scalar ﬁeld
λc ≡ m−1, which at the background and for z = 0 is:
m−1 = 32qfR0/10−4 Mpc h−1
In this “linear

regime,” the scalaron ﬁeld is given by [23]:

are given by Γ(s, r) = R ∞

The upper incomplete gamma function Γ(s, r) and g(c)
ts−1e−tdt and g(c) = [ln(1 +
c) + c/(1 + c)]−1. We have also used the deﬁnition:
rs ≡ R200/c. Eq. 3 is speciﬁc to the case in which
the scalaron is propagating in an Navarro-Frenk-White
(NFW) density ﬁeld of a galaxy cluster with concentra-
tion c, mass M200, and radius R200. The subscript 200
implies that the mass and radii are deﬁned to be where
the density of the halo equals ∆200 = 200 times the crit-
ical density of the universe: M200 = 4π
200∆200ρcrit. In
practice, the concentration is an NFW ﬁtting parameter
attained by ﬁtting the cumulative mass proﬁle [24, 25]:

3 R3

M (< r) = g(c)M200(cid:20) ln(cid:18)1 +

r

rs(cid:19) −

r

r + rs(cid:21).

(5)

The transition from the Chameleon (Eq. 3) and Lin-
ear regimes (Eq. 4) is eﬃcient, so we model it as being
instantaneous and match them using,

δfR = min(δf lin

R , δf cham

R

).

(6)

As shown by [23], this approach agrees with the numer-
ical solution to the scalaron equation of motion in the
vicinity of an NFW density ﬁeld. Note that the theoret-
ical uncertainty is negligible when compared to observa-
tional uncertainties (thoroughly explained in the Sec. V
below).

The GR potential (φGR) is the usual gravitational po-
tential that satisﬁes the Poisson equation and therefore
determines the motion of massive particles. φGR can be
attained by solving the Poisson equation with the NFW
mass proﬁle of Eq. 4,

φGR(r) = −g(c) ln(cid:18) r

C. Escaping a galaxy cluster in

an expanding universe

However, our observable, as explained in the next sec-
tion, is the escape velocity proﬁle (vesc(r)) which is re-
lated to the potential set by both the gravity of the clus-
ter and the expanding universe (Φ(r)). This eﬀective
potential relates to the escape velocity proﬁle as usual:
−2Φ(r) = v2
esc(r). Following [26], we derive vesc(r) for
a cluster described by an NFW density in an expanding
universe with GR as its prescription for gravity,

− 2ΦGR(r) = v2

esc,GR(r),

(8)

= −2[φGR(r) − φGR(req)] − qH 2[r2 − r2

eq].

req is the “equivalence radius”, deﬁned to be the point at
which the acceleration due to the gravitational potential
of the cluster and the expanding universe are equivalent:
req ≡ ( GM200
−qH 2 )1/3. q is the deceleration parameter and H
is the Hubble parameter. Using Eq. 1, in an expanding
Chameleon f(R) gravity universe instead we have:

3

III. OBSERVABLES

We measure the escape velocity of galaxy clusters
through the technique (developed in [28]), in which the
Newtonian gravitational potential proﬁle is reconstructed
from the escape velocity “edge”, identiﬁed from the clus-
ter radius-velocity space (i.e. the “phase space”). This
is a well-developed and well-tested technique and it has
been used in numerous studies of the mass proﬁles of
galaxy clusters [29–34]. The escape edge for a given halo
is constructed by taking the maximum velocity in the
particle phase space for each r/R200 bin in 0.05 inter-
vals. In GR simulations, the observed escape edge has
been shown to recover the theoretical vesc to ∼ 5% accu-
racy, depending on the model used [35].

A. N-body simulations

To construct our potential proﬁles from the escape ve-
locity edge we utilize the particles in N-body simulations
developed in [36, 37] which have identical initial con-
ditions, but incorporate either GR or f(R) as their pre-
scriptions for gravity. The cosmological parameters used
for these simulations are as follows: Ωm = 0.24, ΩΛ =
0.76, h = 0.719, ns = 0.961 [37]. Here our focus is on the
simulated GR, FR6, and FR5 runs. Brieﬂy, the adaptive
mesh reﬁnement N-Body simulations take place in a 1.5
Gpc h−1 cube with 10243 resolution and a particle reso-
lution of 6.2 × 1010M⊙h−1. The large box size is required
to provide the number of high mass clusters required in
our analysis. The halos are deﬁned by the Amiga Halo
Finder or AHF [38].

IV. PROBING GRAVITY

To diﬀerentiate between GR and MG we probe the ra-
tio of the averaged gravitational proﬁle of high mass clus-
ters, to the averaged gravitational potential of low mass
clusters. We infer the ratio from N-body simulations
through the aforementioned technique and compare our
results to the aforementioned theoretical expectations for
each respective theory of gravity. More speciﬁcally, our
probe is encapsulated in the following equation:

− 2Φf (R)(r) = v2
= v2

esc,f (R)(r),

esc,GR(r) +(cid:2)δfR(r) − δfR(req)(cid:3).

(9)

Φhigh(r)
Φlow(r)

≡

hv2
hv2

esc,high(r)i
esc,low(r)i

.

(10)

Eqs. 7 and 8 use NFW parameters that have been mea-
sured from the cluster density proﬁles. In real data, these
would be measured using the observed weak lensing shear
proﬁle around clusters which is unaﬀected by the eﬀects
of f (R) gravity (see the appendix of [27]). Our test is
then built to compare the matter-inferred GR or f(R)
gravity potential proﬁles to the observed dynamical es-
cape velocity proﬁle.

Why separate clusters into two mass bins? The reasons
are twofold. First, as shown in [39] the Chameleon mech-
anism induces a mass dependent screening eﬀect which
leads to high mass clusters being screened and low mass
clusters being increasingly unscreened. Relative to their
high mass counterparts, less screened low mass clusters
will exhibit higher escape velocity edges, resulting in a
reduced potential ratio compared to expectations from

FIG. 1: The z = 0 gravitational potential ratio between high and low mass bins of synthetic galaxy clusters for the GR (black),
the FR5 (left) parametrization of f (R) gravity (green), and the FR6 (right) parametrization (red). The points are the average
of the square of the observed escape velocities for each bin in radius and mass. The errors are 1σ on the mean from boot-strap
re-sampling. The solid lines represent the theoretical predictions using the NFW density parameter (Eqns. 7-9). Note the & 5σ
level diﬀerence between the GR and FR5 ratios. The percentages denote how we separate the high and low mass bins. Note
that the separation between GR and f(R) potential ratios increases with increasing separation in the mass bins.

GR. The cluster potential ratio is a smoking gun test
of modiﬁed theories of gravity employing the Chameleon
screening mechanism. Secondly, the ratio allows us to
undercut both observational and theoretical systematics.
Precisely how this ratio allows us to do so is thoroughly
explained in the next section.

Now, to compare clusters in each of the three (GR,
FR6, and FR5) simulations we employ one-to-one match-
ing. We ﬁnd cluster-sized over-densities at the same
positions at z = 0 across all three simulations using a
halo’s center positions from an AHF-generated halo cat-
alog [38]. We begin with 100 halos uniformly sampled in
log mass between ∼ 1014 − 1015M⊙h−1. The 100 halos
per simulation are then binned into a low mass bin and
a high mass bin each of which corresponds to selecting a
percentile of the of least and most massive clusters. The
speciﬁc mass bin ranges are as follows. For GR, the low
mass bin is: 9.10 × 1013 − 1.96 × 1014M⊙h−1 and the high
mass bin is: 7.48 × 1014 − 1.58 × 1015M⊙h−1. For FR6,
the low mass bin is: 9.13 × 1013 − 1.97 × 1014M⊙h−1 and
high mass bin is: 7.34 × 1014 − 1.58 × 1015M⊙h−1. For
FR5, the low mass bin is: 1.16×1014−1.94×1014M⊙h−1
and the high mass bin is: 7.49×1014−1.58×1015M⊙h−1.
For each of the simulation halos, we attain both the
phase space escape velocity proﬁle through the aforemen-
tioned technique, as well as the potential proﬁle based on
matter density NFW ﬁt (Eq. 5). With the former we can
construct the “observed” dynamical gravitational poten-
tial proﬁle and with the latter the prediction from GR or
f(R) gravity. We then take the ratio between the aver-
aged high mass edge proﬁles and the averaged low mass
edge proﬁles (Eq. 10).

The resulting averaged proﬁle ratios are shown in Fig-
ure 1. The errors are 1σ on the mean from boot-strap
re-sampling with replacement. The solid lines represent

the theoretical predictions using the NFW density pa-
rameter (Eqns. 7-9). Note that we chose to present the
ratios as a function of r/R200 rather than r as a way to
remove the side eﬀects that arise when comparing clus-
ters of diﬀerent masses. When plotted as a function of
r the potential ratio of Figure 1 attains a positive slope
which arises as a result of diﬀerent underlying mass pro-
ﬁles. Thus, re-scaling by each cluster’s respective R200
ﬂattens the proﬁle and makes the potential ratios of Fig-
ure 1 a much cleaner and clearer observable: one that
depends on the amplitude of the potential and not the
shape of the potential proﬁle.

As Figure 1 also shows, our theoretical predictions
can successfully reproduce our (simulated) observable to
high precision. On that ﬁgure we also plot the aver-
aged potential ratio for diﬀerent mass bins. One im-
portant conclusion from this is that the closer we bring
the two mass bins, the more attenuated the diﬀerence
between GR and f (R) becomes. We would like to men-
tion that dynamical diﬀerences in Fig. 1 are solely due
to modiﬁcations to gravity and not to mass diﬀerences
in the simulation. Comparing the average mass ratios:
hM200,highi/hM200,lowi = 6.40, 6.39, 6.02 for GR, FR6
and FR5 respectively, we conclude that averaged mass ra-
tio diﬀerences are negligible when compared to the ∼ 25%
diﬀerence between the GR or FR6 and the FR5 potential
ratios shown in Fig. 1.

Given our ability to precisely predict our observable (as
demonstrated by Figure 1), we demonstrate the theoret-
ical lower limit on how well our new probe can constrain
Chameleon f (R) gravity. Cosmic variance is the largest
component of the uncertainty on the potential ratios for
the small samples we examine. We study a more realis-
tic synthetic data-set using the 2-dimensional projected
phase spaces in the following sections.

V. SYSTEMATICS

In order to assess the viability of our probe, we care-
fully consider relevant systematics. More speciﬁcally, we
focus on: the systematic error induced by cosmic vari-
ance, statistical errors that arise from projection eﬀects,
as well as additional systematics that arise from sampling
of galaxies in clusters.

One relevant systematic arises from the fact that we
are using a very small sample of the clusters in the Uni-
verse to generate Figures 1 and 2. We chose this sample
size as it reﬂects the scale of data we have today for mea-
suring both weak-lensing proﬁles and also with signiﬁcant
spectroscopic follow-up [40–42].

The dashed lines band as shown in Figure 2 incorpo-
rates the systematic uncertainty due to cosmic variance
on a sample of this size (20 clusters per mass bin) which
was measured to be 10% using a larger set of GR simula-
tions (the Millennium simulations [43]). In other words,
the observed ratio Φhigh(r)
Φlow (r) can vary as much as 10% when
measured for a sample size as small as ∼ 20 clusters per
mass bin. This is an important systematic which de-
creases as the sample size increases.

We also assess environmental screening, in which some
fraction of the lower mass clusters in the f (R) simula-
tions could be screened due to large-scale over-densities
[44]. If this were to happen, the observed FR5 and FR6
ratios would be higher (closer to GR) than predicted by
the theory. We control for random noise due to varia-
tions in the large-scale environments of the clusters by
using one-to-one matching for the halos across the GR,
FR5 and FR6 simulations. Also, we ensure that none of
the clusters lie within the virial radii of other clusters.
Finally, we can evaluate our dataset for possible eﬀects
from environmental screening using Figure 1, where the
FR5 and FR6 predictions match our measurements to
high precision. If screening were present, one would ﬁnd
the FR5 and FR6 measurements of the f (R) simulation
data to be closer to the GR simulation data. We note
that the absolute accuracy of the cluster sample used
in Figure 1 is limited by cosmic variance of order 10%.
We conclude that the eﬀects of screening on this test are
smaller than systematic and statistical uncertainties on
our measurements, so long as non-merging clusters are
chosen for the analysis.

We use the Millennium simulations with the light cone
data provided by [45] to investigate projection eﬀects,
which is likely the dominant component of the error on
the potential ratio. To carry out our proposed test with
physical (rather than synthetic) data, the escape velocity
proﬁle of a cluster would be inferred from the line-of-sight
velocities of galaxies in that given cluster, rather than the
radial component of the 3D velocity. Fortunately we can
transform, roughly, the line-of-sight velocities into 3D ve-
locities and vice versa. As shown in [46] the mapping
between the radial 3D escape velocity proﬁle considered
above (vesc(r)) and the line-of-sight escape velocity pro-

FIG. 2: The simulated and theoretical averaged GR and f (R)
gravity potential ratios for the same clusters of Figure 1 (top
20% and bottom 20% mass bins). We have added the the-
oretical prediction for |fR0| = 4 × 10−6 gravity (yellow) and
include not only the GR statistical error on the mean (black
error bars) but also the 10% systematic error due to cosmic
variance (black dashed lines). This ﬁgure demonstrates how
we would detect and/or constrain MG. Assuming GR as our
“observation,” the data is contained within the black dashed
bands. We can therefore ask the question: which of the three
plotted models best describes the data? We conclude our
probe can, including systematics, successfully discern between
GR and |fR0| = 4×10−6 at 1σ.Note that this result is attained
with only 40 clusters (20 in each mass bin) and the potential
is inferred from 3-dimensional phase space synthetic data. We
reproduce this plot for a projected DESI-like data-set in Fig.
4.

ﬁle inferred from data (vesc,los(r)) is as follows:

v2
esc,los(r) = g−1(β) × v2

esc(r)

(11)

Where g(β) is given by g(β) = 3 − 2β(r)/1 − β(r) and is
of O(1). β(r) is given by β(r) = 1 − hv2
r i [46].
As such, in projected space Eq. 10 is instead,

φi/2hv2

θ + v2

Φhigh,los(r)
Φlow,los(r)

≡

hg(βlow)i
hg(βhigh)i

hv2
hv2

esc,high(r)i
esc,low(r)i

.

(12)

However, the ratio of the averaged g(β) proﬁles for high
and low mass systems is hg(βhigh)i/hg(βlow)i ≈ 1 and
so the line-of-sight potential ratio is the same as the 3D
potential ratio:

Φhigh,los(r)
Φlow,los(r)

≈

Φhigh(r)
Φlow(r)

(13)

Therefore, our expectation is that by dividing out the
averaged cluster potential proﬁles we eliminate the ne-
cessity to estimate the anisotropy proﬁle. We note that
another observational challenge lies in eliminating line-
of-sight galaxies that may not be cluster members and
will therefore contaminate our phase space.

FIG. 3: The gravitational potential ratio of Fig. 1 (black dots
with statistical error) and the gravitational ratio as inferred
from an ensemble of clusters (gray line with statistical error)
from the light cone data of [45]. The high and low mass clus-
ter ensembles are made up of 5 diﬀerent ensembles each with
10 clusters that include 500 galaxies each. The error bars
are 1σ error on the mean from boot-strap re-sampling. This
nearly ﬂat transfer function incorporates numerous observa-
tional systematics when going from 3D to realistic observa-
tional data.

We recognize that there exist few observational sur-
veys containing clusters around the mean mass in our
low-mass subsample. However, with new imaging and
spectroscopic surveys, we expect future datasets to pro-
vide excellent weak lensing mass proﬁles as well as sig-
niﬁcant spectroscopic follow-up.

Therefore, we consider two cases of projection. The
ﬁrst uses an ensemble cluster dataset, where the weak-
lensing mass proﬁles and the spectroscopic potential pro-
ﬁles are inferred from averaged or stacked datasets as
would be measured using current facilities. The second
uses a much larger sample of clusters based on deeper
data, where the weak-lensing and spectroscopic potential
proﬁles could be measured individually for the clusters
and then averaged.

A. Stacked cluster ensembles

To build a cluster ensemble we superimpose the phase-
spaces of individual clusters. In particular, we use 500
galaxies per phase space with 10 high mass and 10 low
mass clusters to create a high and a low mass cluster en-
semble. The masses of the clusters are chosen to match
the average masses of the sample used in Figures 1 and
2. The galaxies used to populate the phase spaces are
all brighter than an r-band magnitude of 17.7 and the
clusters are within z=0.15 such that this is an SDSS-like
stacked ensemble of clusters. As before, we compute the
averaged potential ratios (Eq. 10) and the boot-strapped

6

error bars. The result is shown on Fig.3 (solid gray line).
The scatter dots with statistical error represent the 3D
inferred edge (as in Fig. 1 and 2). We ﬁnd that over the
range 0.4 ≤ r/R200 ≤ 0.9, the 2D projected and the 3D
ratios are statistically identical. At the same time, our
constraints on |fR0| are robust to small (5%) corrections
in the ratio as we go from 3D to 2D. This conﬁrms the ex-
pectation detailed above which speculated that the aver-
aged ratio of potential proﬁles allows us to undercut com-
plications that arise from working with projected data.
However, Fig. 3 also shows that the errors from projec-
tion are as large as cosmic variance for a small sample of
∼20 clusters.

B. DESI Bright Galaxy Sample forecast

In order to decrease the errors, we investigate a much
larger (by a factor of ∼ 10) sample of clusters. Within
the Henriques light cone [45] we generate a Dark Energy
Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Bright Galaxy Sample-
like selection function. While for the previous studies we
constrained the observed galaxy population to brighter
than the SDSS main sample, we now use galaxies to an
r-band magnitude limit of 19.1. We still focus on clusters
within z=0.15. The deeper magnitude limit increases
the number of clusters with greater than 50 galaxies in
the phase space to many hundreds per mass bin. This
sample is an approximation to what may be observed
with DESI and would allow us to probe both a wider
and deeper sample of the sky, thereby undercutting the
eﬀects of cosmic variance and increasing the total number
of galaxy clusters in our sample.

We re-create the mass bins chosen in the previous sam-
ple (see section IV) by choosing clusters with masses
between 1014/h < M200/M ⊙ < 2.1 × 1014/h for the
low mass sample, and M200/M ⊙ > 6 × 1014/h for the
high mass sample. The average mass for the low and
high mass sample respectively are: 1.4 × 1014M ⊙/h and
8.2 × 1014M ⊙/h. From those two mass bins we then
make a conservative cut by picking clusters that contain
at least 50 galaxies between |vlos| ≤ 2000 km/s within 3
Mpc from the cluster center.

To predict the potentials in this sample, we use
the halo masses of each cluster and derive concentra-
tions from the mass-concentration relation provided in
[47]: c200(M200, z) = A200(M200/Mpivot)B200 (1 + z)C200.
Where A200 = 5.71, B200 = −0.084, C200 = −0.47 and
Mpivot = 2 × 1012M⊙h−1. This sample assumes that
weak lensing masses are unbiased. The width of our mass
bins are larger than the one sigma mass scatter in the
weak lensing observable [48]. Because of the wide width
of our mass bins, we can ignore weak lensing mass uncer-
tainties when calculating the theoretical predictions.

In Figure 4, we show the averaged potential ratio be-
tween the two mass bins (Eq. 10) with both statistical
(boot-strapped as before) and systematic error (cosmic
variance) for the aforementioned DESI-like sample. As

before, we also show the theoretical predictions for both
GR and f (R) gravity. Several conclusions regarding sys-
tematics aﬀecting our probe may be drawn from Figure
4:

• Our GR 3D theory (solid black line) can accurately
predict the potential ratio generated with projected
synthetic data. This conﬁrms that we can success-
fully divide out projection eﬀects by taking the ra-
tio of averaged potentials (as implied by Eqns. 12
and 13).

• Projection eﬀects increase the statistical error rel-
ative to the unrealistic 3D ratio. This is expected
and discussed in [49].
In particular, compare the
few percent statistical error on the 3D ratio of Fig-
ures 1 and 2 with the ∼ 8% statistical error of Fig.
4. However, while projection increases the statis-
tical error on the ratio, the cosmic variance of a
larger sample goes down as the square root of the
fractional increase in the sample size, which for a
DESI-like sample is ∼10 times as many clusters as
used in our previous results (Figures 1, 2, and 3.)

• The phase spaces only need to be moderately pop-
ulated with 50 galaxies between |vlos| ≤ 2000 km/s
within 3 Mpc from the cluster center. This is nec-
essary in order to measure the escape velocity edge.
By selecting the 50 brightest galaxies to create the
phase spaces, the test is immune to color bias, at
least to the level probed by the simulated galaxy
catalog. We also ﬁnd that if we under-populate the
phase space, we can bias our low mass cluster po-
tential proﬁles. This is a known eﬀect and studied
in detail in [29].

We also investigate whether

the assumed mass-
concentration relation aﬀects our potential ratios. We
examine a range of uncertainties in the parameters which
describe the relation and ﬁnd that the potential ratio
proﬁles vary less than 1%. This is because all mass-
concentrations relations are quite ﬂat at the cluster
masses we study here and also because the mass diﬀer-
ence between the high and low mass sub-samples is quite
small.

Generally, we note that the utilization of the ratio of
potentials mitigates systematic eﬀects of the observables
and theory beyond the aforementioned projection eﬀects.
For instance, [35] found that NFW density proﬁles pre-
dict NFW potentials that are biased high by 10-20%.
Einasto proﬁles on the other hand show <5% biases.
However, they also showed that there is no diﬀerence
between the predicted and observed phase space escape
velocities as a function of halo mass. We tested that by
comparing the GR prediction from Eq. 10 using NFW
density ﬁts to the more accurate Einasto density proﬁle
ﬁts. We ﬁnd that the ratios agree to within a percent. In
other words, while the NFW mass proﬁle systematically
overestimates the cluster potential proﬁles, the ratio of

FIG. 4: The projected gravitational potential ratio for a
DESI-like galaxy cluster sample (black dots and bootstrap
error on the mean) as inferred from synthetic galaxy clus-
ters from the light cone provided by [45]. Compared to Fig.
2 (where the ratio is inferred from a 3D phase space) we
see that projection signiﬁcantly increases the statistical error.
However, the DESI sample of Fig. 4 is signiﬁcantly larger
as it contains 9.6 times many more clusters and so the sys-
tematic error is signiﬁcantly reduced (286 low mass clusters
and 96 high mass clusters). We can determine which gravi-
tational theory best matches the ”observation.” To visualize
this, we plot both the GR theoretical prediction (black line)
and two f (R) theoretical predictions (orange-red and yellow).
We conclude that our probe can diﬀerentiate between GR and
|fR0| = 4 × 10−6 (2 × 10−6) at > 5σ (> 2σ).

NFW potentials is unbiased. Similar arguments can be
made about other possible systematics, including line-of-
sight eﬀects, velocity bias, and velocity anisotropies as
mentioned in the bullet points above [29, 31, 50].

VI. STATISTICAL CONSTRAINTS ON f (R)

GRAVITY

Given our analysis of systematics detailed above, we
can provide a robust estimate of how well our probe will
be able to constrain MG on the two diﬀerent cluster sam-
ples we simulate. To diﬀerentiate between GR and f (R)
gravity, we assume that we live in a GR universe with a
ΛCDM cosmology (i.e. our “measurements” are the black
dots of Figure 1-4), and calculate the χ2 between the
measurement and the theoretical predictions. The statis-
tical GR error is calculated from boot-strap re-sampling
of the mean and the systematic GR error takes into ac-
count the cosmic variance. The uncertainty is taken to
be the combined statistical and systematic errors added
in quadrature.

We ﬁrst compare against a stacked ensemble of clus-
ters. We assume an SDSS-like cluster sample with 10
stacked clusters per ensemble and 5 cluster ensembles

per mass bin. Recall that individually, the clusters are
too poorly sampled in their spectroscopy. However, the
two ensemble clusters would have a high signal-to-noise
weak lensing mass proﬁle as well as a well-determined
escape velocity proﬁle. In this case, the cosmic variance
term dominates the error budget. The χ2 test indicates
that we can diﬀerentiate GR from |fR0| = 5.5 × 10−6 at
2σ.

By increasing the sample size we can improve these
constraints.
In particular, see Fig. 4, where we show
that with the DESI-like sample of galaxy clusters, we can
constrain |fR0| = 4 × 10−6 (2 × 10−6) at > 5σ (> 2σ).

These are competitive forecasts compared with the two
most recent galaxy cluster-scale constraints. For exam-
ple, [18] presents an analysis of 58 clusters in the XMM
sample that constrains |fR0| < 6 × 10−5 at 95% con-
ﬁdence. Similar to the potential ratio test presented
here, [18] focuses only on cluster scales, i.e., within the
virialized region of clusters. Using stacking on only 50
clusters per mass bin and after including both statisti-
cal and systematic uncertainties on the observable, our
potential ratio test can achieve an order-of-magnitude
improvement over observational constraints set by [18].
The most competitive cluster-scale constraint is set by
[16] with a cluster abundance analysis. They ﬁnd that
|fR0| < 1.62 × 10−5 at 95% CL. Our test should be able
to diﬀerentiate |fR0| = 1.62 × 10−5 and GR at >> 5σ.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

We propose a new test for gravity within galaxy clus-
ters that leverages the ways in which modiﬁcations to
gravity alter the dynamical potential while leaving the
weak-lensing inferred potential proﬁle unchanged. We
take the ratio of the squared escape velocity proﬁle for
high and low mass clusters as our observable. We do this
for two reasons: 1) it leverages the fact that Chameleon
screening leaves the dynamics of the high mass clusters
unaﬀected compared to the low mass clusters and 2) it
removes any systematic that is present in both samples,
such as velocity bias and velocity anisotropy. While this
test can be applied generally to any new model for grav-
ity which has this property, we test it against Chameleon
f (R) gravity.

We ﬁrst use simulations to show that particles, as trac-
ers of the dynamical gravitational potential within galaxy
clusters, do have enhanced escape velocity proﬁles com-

8

pared to expectations from their non-dynamical (i.e. par-
ticle) masses. We then use mock galaxy catalogs to un-
derstand the role of systematics in quantifying how well
we can rule out f (R) gravity. We study two cases. The
ﬁrst utilizes a realistic but rather small number of clusters
which we stack to create 2 cluster ensembles with diﬀer-
ent mass bins. We also study a second dataset which is
much larger and more representative of what we expect
from future surveys. In the former, cosmic variance dom-
inates the systematic error budget, while in the latter 2D
projection eﬀects dominate. In either case, we ﬁnd that
our probe is more sensitive, by an order of magnitude,
over current cluster-based tests for Chameleon f (R) grav-
ity. More speciﬁcally, we have quantiﬁed our prediction
for a DESI Bright Galaxy Sample-like set of clusters to
push down current constraints to |fR0| < 2 × 10−6 at
> 2σ.

The test of gravity that we propose here is designed to
leverage the next generation large-scale photometric and
spectroscopic surveys (e.g., the Dark Energy Survey [51]
and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument–DESI)
providing high quality weak-lensing mass proﬁles of clus-
ters and deep and plentiful spectroscopic follow-up of the
cluster phase spaces. While we focus on scales r < R200,
we note that the diﬀerence between the GR and f (R)
gravity ratio increases as we go out to larger radii. This
is due to the scalaron’s ﬁfth force being more eﬀective in
the outskirts of clusters where the density is lower. We
also note that the diﬀerence between the GR and f (R)
gravity decreases with increasing redshift. We have not
yet included these properties into our statistical quan-
tiﬁcation, but we expect that they will prove useful in
setting even tighter constraints. We will explore these in
a future eﬀort.
