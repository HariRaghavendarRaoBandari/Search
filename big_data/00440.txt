Abstract. We review recent progress in understanding the notion of locality in
integrable quantum lattice systems. The central concept are the so-called quasilocal
conserved quantities, which go beyond the standard perception of locality. Two
systematic procedures to rigorously construct families of quasilocal conserved operators
based on quantum transfer matrices are outlined, specializing on anisotropic Heisenberg
XXZ spin-1/2 chain. Quasilocal conserved operators stem from two distinct classes
of representations of the auxiliary space algebra, comprised of unitary (compact)
representations, which can be naturally linked to the fusion algebra and quasiparticle
content of the model, and non-unitary (non-compact) representations giving rise
to charges, manifestly orthogonal to the unitary ones. Various condensed matter
applications in which quasilocal conservation laws play an essential role are presented,
with special emphasis on their implications for anomalous transport properties (ﬁnite
Drude weight) and relaxation to non-thermal steady states in the quantum quench
scenario.

1. Introduction

Local conservation laws are amongst the most important fundamental concepts in
theoretical physics. In generic systems, these usually comprise of energy, momentum,
particle number, etc., and correspond to Noether charges connected to rather obvious
physical symmetries. On the other hand, in systems which are exactly solvable, or
integrable, the number of conservation laws and the corresponding conserved charges
can be much larger and the underlying symmetries sometimes quite hidden. According
to a widespread belief, integrability should provide us with a 1-to-1 correspondence
between conserved charges and physical degrees of freedom. However, such a deﬁnition
is only really applicable – or unambiguous – in classical deterministic (Hamiltonian)
systems with a ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom where it amounts to the historical,
Liouville–Arnold integrability.

Interacting quantum systems, where local degrees of freedom (quantum spins,
fermions, or bosons) are arranged along a regular 1D lattice, are typically considered
integrable in one of the following cases: Firstly,
there may exist a canonical
(Bogoliubov) transformation which maps the local degrees of freedom to non-interacting
quasiparticles. Such is, for example, the situation with quantum transverse ﬁeld Ising
model, or XY spin-1/2 chain [1]. These systems, which are reducible to a single particle
picture and are often referred to as quasi-free, shall not be of interest in this article, even
though they allow for an illustration of some non-trivial many-body phenomena, such
as area laws for entanglement [2]. Secondly, there exist systems exhibiting genuine
interparticle interaction whose dynamics is representable in terms of quasi-particles
which undergo non-diﬀractive scattering without particle production. A central feature
in such a case is factorizability of an arbitrary multi-particle scattering process in terms
of subsequent 2-particle scattering events, mathematically phrased in the form of the
celebrated Yang–Baxter (or star-triangle) equation. One of the most remarkable physical
consequences of that mechanism is the emergence of a macroscopic number of local
integrals of motion (conservation laws). One of these charges, usually the ﬁrst one
in the series, is considered as the Hamiltonian (with local interactions). Here locality
means that the densities of these charges act non-trivially only on a ﬁnite number of
adjacent lattice sites. Integrability in the sense of Yang and Baxter, which is universally
understood within the framework of algebraic structures known as quantum groups [3–6],
is perhaps the most general widely acceptable deﬁnition of integrability known to date.
Besides deﬁning and describing integrability in closed quantum many-body systems
in 1D [7], it also covers 2D equilibrium classical statistical systems [8], nonequilibrium
classical driven diﬀusive 1D systems [9], as well as classical Hamiltonian systems [10,11],
and since more recently, also integrable nonequilibrium steady states of open quantum
interacting systems [12].

Interacting integrable quantum systems are for quite some time no longer only of
pure mathematical or theoretical interest.
In the last decade a dramatic progress in
experimental techniques for manipulation of ultracold atoms enabled a few successful

Quasilocal charges in integrable lattice systems

experimental realizations [13–20]. The fact that certain integrable many-body systems
can already be routinely controlled in a concrete experimental setup also underlies
a remarkable degree of structural stability for some of their dynamical properties
with respect to model imperfections (perturbations), in spite of the fact that strict
integrability technically requires precise (or ﬁne-tuned) cancellations of most of
generically allowed processes. This may hint to an existence of a yet undisclosed
quantum analogy of KAM (Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser) scenario [21]. To our opinion
this is one of the potentially most exciting problems for future research [22, 23].

As discussed above, Yang–Baxter integrability for a lattice system with N sites,
guarantees a macroscopic number ∝ N of local conservation laws and the corresponding
local currents. By a local conservation law one understands an operator-valued
continuity equation, involving a charge and a current density being operators supported
on a ﬁnite number of, say n (cid:28) N , physical sites. The summation of the local charge
density over the whole volume of N sites then deﬁnes an extensive local conserved
charge of the integrable model. One might wonder whether such local conserved
charges represent a complete set, meaning that any extensive conserved operator
which scales linearly with N can be represented as a linear combination of these
local charges. There were even some formal completeness results for speciﬁc models
[24], and one might have been tempted to conclude that local charges (derived from
fundamental Yang-Baxter transfer matrix) are all the conserved operators needed to
understand local physics. However, certain unconventional phenomena discovered later
in studies of paradigmatic examples of interacting integrable systems gave, in spite of
a missing formal understanding, quite the opposite indications. Firstly, it has been
discovered [25, 26] that spin Drude weight in integrable anisotropic Heisenberg chains
(XXZ model) is ﬁnite at ﬁnite temperature, despite the fact that contribution of all
hitherto known local charges to spin current was zero. In more recent works it has been
found [27,28] that a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE) formed of the same standard set
of local conserved charges fails to describe thermalization after a quantum quench in the
gapped XXZ model. These results hinted at the existence of additional eﬀectively local
conserved charges linearly independent from the strictly local ones. One should note that
in studies of inﬁnite quantum (and even classical) lattice systems, extensive observables
form a vector space rather than the full algebra, so it is the linear independence and
not functional independence that matters.

The ﬁrst progress along the above lines came, unexpectedly, with the solution of
an open XXZ model [29] driven out of equilibrium with eﬀective magnetic (particle)
reservoirs at the boundary formulated in terms of Lindblad master equation. The
steady state solution in the perturbative (weak-coupling) regime turned out to be
tightly related to a novel eﬀectively local (or quasilocal) conservation law which in
turn explained the controversial problem of the ballistic conductivity by providing a
non-trivial rigorous lower bound on the spin Drude weight and conﬁrming previous
results of several numerical studies [30–33] and bosonization techniques [34, 35]. In a
subsequent study [36], a connection to certain non-standard solutions to Yang–Baxter

Quasilocal charges in integrable lattice systems

equation has been unveiled, allowing a systematic construction of the whole set of
quasilocal conservation laws directly from commuting transfer matrices pertaining to
complex-spin (non-unitarty) representations and yielding a further improved Mazur
bound on the Drude weight. Afterwards, generalizations of these results to periodic
boundary conditions appeared simultaneously in two independent works
[37, 38]. A
distinguished property of these so-called ‘non-unitary’ quasilocal charges is that they do
not exhibit the spin-reversal invariance of the XXZ Hamiltonian and hence may have a
nonvanishing overlap with observables which are odd with respect to spin reversal, such
as the spin current. Very recently, even more exotic non-unitary quasilocal charges have
been discovered where even the particle conservation (U (1)- symmetry) is broken [39].
Similar constructions of quasilocal charges and consequent Drude weight bounds can
be performed also in other gapless integrable quantum spin models, for example in
spin-1 Fatteev–Zamolodchikov chain [40]. We should remark, however, that it is the
compactness of q-deformation rather than masslessness of the elementary excitations
which facilitates constructions of quasilocal charges. This should allow the presented
concepts to be extended to massive integrable models like sine-Gordon theory.

In spite of all rather profound implications mentioned above, the family of non-
unitary quasilocal conserved operators has not been capable to oﬀer an answer to the
puzzle related to an apparent inapplicability of the concept of a Generalized Gibbs
Ensemble which has been vividly debated about the same time. In particular, it became
clear that in a generic situation an appropriate extension of the GGE requires quasilocal
conservation laws which are admissible for the whole range of anisotropies, invariant
under spin-reversal transformation, but still distinct from the canonical ones obtained
from expanding the fundamental transfer matrix. Such quasilocal charges have been
constructed (for the isotropic case) in Ref. [41], invoking transfer matrices built from
unitary but non-fundamental spin representations of the auxiliary spin. Soon after, a
study [42] conﬁrmed that those charges exactly explain the GGE conundrum.

Outline. The present review article aims at a coherent and pedagogical (i.e. non-
technical) introduction to the notion of quasilocal conserved charges and various physical
applications in which they take the center stage. As the focus is primarily to elucidate
the main ideas and their interrelations, a reader seeking for a more detailed and rigorous
exposition is referred to the quoted literature. Sec. 2 consists of a minimal technical
background for getting familiar with the main concepts presented in this article. Sec. 3
is devoted to the construction of what we call ‘unitary’ quasilocal charges, namely
conservation laws arising from the unitary representations of an underlying symmetry
group. In Sec. 4 a more intricate case of ‘non-unitary’ quasilocal charges which break
the spin-reversal (or, in general, some other Z2 parity) symmetry is presented. Sec. 5
is dedicated to exposition of several physical applications: Sec. 5.1 discusses rigorous
Mazur bounds on spin Drude weights. Sec. 5.2 makes a link to quantum quenches from
spin-reversal symmetric initial states and highlights the duality between the spectra
of quasilocal charges and density distributions which describe bound states, providing

Quasilocal charges in integrable lattice systems

a bridge to the language of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. Sec. 5.3 illustrates the
connection to integrable nonequilibrium steady states of boundary-driven quantum
master (Lindblad) equations. In this review, all the concepts are presented explicitly
on a concrete example of XXZ chain and the associated Uq(sl(2)) quantum symmetry.
We conclude in Sec. 6 where certain possible generalizations to other integrable models
and some questions which enter in the broader context are brieﬂy discussed.

2. Prerequisites

In this section we introduce a framework and technical tools that shall be used in
our paper.
In the Sec. 2.1 we introduce the concepts of quantum spin systems on
the lattice and the corresponding operator (C∗) algebra, and deﬁne the notions of
locality, extensivity, pseudolocality and quasilocality.
In Sec. 2.2 we deﬁne the main
concepts of Yang–Baxter integrability: R-matrices, Lax matrices, transfer matrices,
and fusion hierarchies which allow one to build unitary representations of these objects
from the fundamental one. These concepts enable us to reformulate Bethe’s original
‘coordinate ansatz’ [43] in an entirely algebraic language. This technique is nowadays
named the quantum inverse scattering method and also referred to as the algebraic Bethe
ansatz [7, 44, 45].

The point of our review is to show that one can develop a new perspective on non-
equilibrium quantum physics by combining the Yang–Baxter integrability objects with
the notions of pseudo- and quasilocality of extended quantum lattice systems.

2.1. Pseudolocal and quasilocal operators over quantum lattices

The main theme of this article are conserved charges of integrable lattice models
complying with a certain weaker version of locality. As such, they extend beyond the
orthodox concept of local charges, derived from logarithmic derivatives of fundamental
transfer matrix [7, 44–46], and exhibit physical relevance for computing time-averaged
values of dynamical response functions.

Since we are only concerned with integrable systems, we can limit our discussion to
a one-dimensional lattice Λ = Z, although the concepts of this subsection can be readily
extended to a D-dimensional lattice Λ = ZD. The total Hilbert space, consisting of
d−dimensional single-site Hilbert spaces, will be denoted by H. The Hilbert space of
a lattice subinterval between sites x and x(cid:48), x ≤ x(cid:48), will be denoted by H[x,x(cid:48)] ⊂ H
and the corresponding operator subalgebra by A[x,x(cid:48)]. One obtains the total quasilocal
C∗ operator algebra A as the limit of a sequence {A[−n,n]; n = 1, 2, 3 . . .}, closed in the
operator norm topology [47]. We shall refer to an observable represented by an operator
a ∈ A as local, if it acts nontrivially only on a ﬁnite subinterval [x, x(cid:48)],

a = a[x,x(cid:48)] ⊗ 1Λ\[x,x(cid:48)],

a[x,x(cid:48)] ∈ A[x,x(cid:48)].

(2.1)
The smallest such interval is referred to as the support of a, and its length r = x(cid:48)− x + 1,
as the order of locality. Denoting by Tr[x,x(cid:48)] the trace over H[x,x(cid:48)], one deﬁnes the tracial

Quasilocal charges in integrable lattice systems

state ω0 as

ω0(a) =

Tr[x,x(cid:48)]a[x,x(cid:48)]
Tr[x,x(cid:48)]1[x,x(cid:48)]

,

7

(2.2)

and extends it over an entire A by continuity (of ω0). The tracial state can be interpreted
as the inﬁnite temperature Gibbs state, satisfying ω0(ab) = ω0(ba) and having the
strongest clustering property, namely being separable: ω0(ab) = ω0(a)ω0(b) for any pair
of local observables a, b with disjoint supports.

We deﬁne the Hilbert–Schmidt (HS) inner product as
(a, b) = ω0(a†b) − ω0(a†)ω0(b),

and denote the corresponding HS norm‡ by (cid:107)a(cid:107)HS ≡(cid:112)(a, a). The latter satisﬁes the

(2.3)

standard Cauchy-Schwartz inequality and a mixed inequality in relation to the operator
norm (cid:107) • (cid:107),

|(a, b)| ≤ (cid:107)a(cid:107)HS(cid:107)b(cid:107)HS,

(cid:107)ab(cid:107)HS ≤ (cid:107)a(cid:107)HS(cid:107)b(cid:107).

(2.4)

Equipped with these structures we can deﬁne an orthonormal basis of local observables.
A choice of an on-site basis such that (σα
x ) = δα,α(cid:48), induces the HS orthonormal
basis of algebra A[x,x(cid:48)] consisting of elements of the form

x , σα(cid:48)

σα
[x,x(cid:48)] = σαx

x ⊗ σαx+1

x+1 ⊗ ··· ⊗ σαx(cid:48)
x(cid:48)

.

(2.5)

For example in case of 2-dimensional local Hilbert space, σα≥1
are Pauli matrices while
for 3-dimensional local space, they are Gell-Mann matrices, etc. In all cases we choose
σ0
x = 1x.
associate to each element a ∈ A a translationally invariant sum

We furthermore deﬁne a lattice shift automorphism by ˆS y(a[x,x(cid:48)]) = a[x+y,x(cid:48)+y] and

x

A =

ˆS x(a),

(2.6)

(cid:88)

x

which represents an extensive observable of a translationally invariant inﬁnite quantum
spin chain. Note that A is not an element of quasilocal algebra A, but the above
sum can still be attributed a precise mathematical meaning as a sequence of operators
{A(N )} acting on ﬁnite lattices of increasing lengths N . For example, the Hamiltonian of
locally interacting translational invariant models, as well as other strictly local charges,
are precisely of such form.
In this sense a local operator a is called a density of an
extensive local observable A.

The above sequences have the following properties: (i) volume scaling extensivity

(cid:0)A(N ), A(N )(cid:1) < ∞,

0 < lim
N→∞

1
N

(2.7)

‡ Note that, strictly speaking, (a, b) and (cid:107)a(cid:107)HS become a proper HS product and HS vector norm,
respectively, only after one takes out the identity operator 1 from the algebra A. Otherwise they yield
the HS product and HS norm of the corresponding ‘nearest’ traceless observables. In other words, any
operator of the form c1, c ∈ C, has ‘zero length’.

Quasilocal charges in integrable lattice systems

8
limN→∞(b, A(N )) (cid:54)= 0, with at least one local
and (ii) yielding a ﬁnite overlap, i.e.
operator b (say b = a). In what follows, the upper index N will be left out, since an
extensive operator A is always identiﬁed with the corresponding sequence.

By deﬁnition, any operator sequence A, satisfying extensivity (2.7) (i) and ﬁnite
overlap criteria (ii) shall be referred to as pseudolocal. This relaxes the constraint on
the strict locality of the densities and generalizes the concept in a physically meaningful
way. As we shall argue later, pseudolocality of conserved quantum charges is the decisive
property responsible for ballistic (or non- ergodic [48–50]) scaling of dynamical response
functions. Note that if the density a can be written as a sum of mutually orthogonal
terms a[1,r],

N(cid:88)

a =

a[1,r],

for which the stronger condition, known as quasilocality [36],

r=1

(cid:107)a[1,r](cid:107)HS < Ce−ξr,

ξ > 0

(2.8)

(2.9)

holds, A is automatically pseudolocal.

Here we have considered lattices with open boundaries. For systems with periodic
or twisted boundary conditions, the same concepts can be introduced by making the
shift operator ˆS periodic [37].

The deﬁnition of pseudolocality and quasilocality can be generalized (see Ref. [51])
to an arbitrary suﬃciently strongly clustering state ω (say a Gibbs, or generalized Gibbs
state, etc.) simply by replacing the HS inner product by
(a, b) = ω(a†b) − ω(a†)ω(b),

(2.10)

with the main conclusion that the set of all pseudolocal observables forms a Hilbert
space.

2.2. Yang–Baxter relation, quantum transfer matrices, and fusion hierarchies

A distinguished feature of integrable models is an existence of a macroscopic number of
conservation laws. They arise as a consequence of an exceptional amount of symmetry
which is governed by algebraic structures known as quantum groups [3–6]. The central
element in the story is the so-called quantum R-matrix, an operator acting on a tensor
product of a pair of vector spaces,

R(λ) : V1 ⊗ V2 → V1 ⊗ V2,

(2.11)
that can be considered as representations V1 and V2 of an underlying symmetry algebra,
which we here for simplicity assume to be su(2) or its quantum deformation. In addition,
R(λ) depends analytically on a spectral parameter λ ∈ C. The cornerstone equation of
quantum integrability is obtained by embedding R-matrices into a three-fold tensor

Quasilocal charges in integrable lattice systems

product space V1 ⊗ V2 ⊗ V3, e.g. putting R12(λ) = R(λ) ⊗ 1, and imposing the
requirement

R12(λ − µ)R13(λ)R23(µ) = R23(µ)R13(λ)R12(λ − µ),

∀λ, µ ∈ C,

(2.12)

where we have omitted the indices of vectors spaces on which the operators acts trivially.
This condition is the celebrated Yang–Baxter equation [8] (YBE). Physically speaking,
YBE expresses equivalence of two distinct sequences of two-particle collisions which
as a consequence give factorization property of the whole many-particle scattering
process [52, 53]. What is perhaps even more remarkable is, that such an equivalence
automatically generates an inﬁnite number of conserved quantities. The procedure is
outlined below.

The simplest solution to YBE (2.12) is obtained when the R-matrix acts in two

fundamental spin representations V1/2

∼= C2,
R(λ) : C2 ⊗ C2 → C2 ⊗ C2,

(2.13)
where P is a permutation operator, P|ψ1(cid:105) ⊗ |ψ2(cid:105) = |ψ2(cid:105) ⊗ |ψ1(cid:105). Furthermore, we
introduce the Lax operator L(λ) by interpreting one fundamental space of the R-matrix
as a local physical spin while the second fundamental space is referred to as an auxiliary
space, L12(λ) ≡ R12(λ) = λ + 2i(cid:126)s1 · (cid:126)s2, or

R(λ) = λ − i

(2.14)

The spin generators fulﬁl the su(2) algebraic relations, [s+, s−] = 2sz and [sz, s±] = ±s±,
2(σx ± iσy). For clarity
and in terms of Pauli matrices read sz = 1
of notation we shall here and below write with bold-roman fonts all operators which
act nontrivially in auxiliary (non-physical) spaces. From YBE (2.12) it follows that
the Lax operator Eq. (2.14) by construction obeys the local fundamental commutation
relation (also known as the RLL relation [4,44]) over the auxiliary vector space Ha⊗Ha,
Ha

2σz and s± = σ± = 1

∼= C2,

R12(λ − µ)L1(λ)L2(µ) = L2(µ)L1(λ)R12(λ − µ),

which can be extended to the entire physical Hilbert space Hp
lattice

(2.15)

∼= (C2)⊗N of the N -spin

R12(λ − µ)M1(λ)M2(µ) = M2(µ)M1(λ)R12(λ − µ),

(2.16)

by introducing the monodromy matrix M(λ) acting over Ha ⊗ Hp,

(2.17)
Here and subsequently we use a compact notation of ⊗N to denote a ‘partial’ tensor
product, i.e. an operation where the tensor product only applies to physical components,

M(λ) = L(λ)⊗N .

Quasilocal charges in integrable lattice systems

10

whereas auxiliary components undergo the ordinary matrix multiplication. Finally, by
tracing over the auxiliary space of Eq. (2.17) we produce the fundamental transfer matrix

T (λ) = Tra M(λ),

(2.18)

acting over the spin chain Hilbert space Hp.

An inﬁnite set of conservation laws is a consequence of commutativity property

[T (λ), T (µ)] = 0,

∀λ, µ ∈ C,

(2.19)

which follows directly from the deﬁnition Eq. (2.17) in combination with the YBE (2.12).
In fact, by considering higher-dimensional
irreducible unitary representations of
auxiliary spaces (s > 1/2), one sees that the entire construction also holds for higher-
spin transfer operators. These are constructed from Lax operators Ls(λ) associated
with (2s + 1)-dimensional auxiliary spaces Ha = Vs
Z+

∼= C2s+1 and satisfy
and λ, µ ∈ C.

where, unless otherwise stated, periodic boundary conditions are assumed. This requires
a one-parametric deformation of the symmetry algebra, Uq(sl(2)), implemented through
the deformation parameter q = exp(η) and Lax operator of the following form (see
e.g. [44])

(2.22)

Three regimes are to be distinguished with respect to the anisotropy parameter ∆:

• gapped phase, corresponding to anisotropy ∆ = cosh (η) > 1 with η ∈ R,
• gapless phase, corresponding to |∆| < 1, which we shall write as ∆ = cos(η) with
q-parameter lying on the unit circle q = exp (iη) for η ∈ (0, π).
In this regime,
replacement η → −iη and λ → −iλ is needed in (2.22) to restore the notation that
is most often used (equivalent to exchanging sin and sinh in Eq. (2.22)), that is
used below.

• isotropic point, ∆ = 1, is obtained from either of the phases by taking the scaling

limit, namely to write the spectral parameter as λ → λη and then take η → 0.
The Lax operator (2.22) is invariant under the q-deformed quantum algebra
Uq(sl(2)). Using the standard notation for q-deformed objects [x]q = (qx−q−x)/(q−q−1),
the q-deformed commutation relations read

[s+, s−] = [2sz]q,

q2sz s± = q±2s±q2sz .

In addition to ﬁnite-dimensional unitary representations of Uq(sl(2)) algebra,
YBE (2.12) in fact admits a much larger class of solutions which pertain to generic
s , s ∈ C (see e.g. Refs. [54–56]). These
complex-spin highest-weight representation V +
are of inﬁnite dimension for generic value of s, and turn out to be inappropriate for

Let us now switch the focus to the properties of higher-spin transfer matrices Ts
and their spectra, which play a vital part in the construction of quasilocal conserved
charges.

2.2.2. Quantum Hirota equation. The quantum Hirota equation [57–62], also known
as the T - system [63, 64], is a bilinear diﬀerence equation which takes the form

This relation can be formally understood as the quantized version of Weyl’s formula for
characters of classical representations, while physically it just represents fusion rules on
an underlying algebra in a compact fashion. Higher-spin transfer operators Ts represent
the canonical solution to the Hirota equation. In this case the scalar potentials have to be
identiﬁed as φ(λ) = T0(λ+ iη
2 ), where T0(λ) = (sin (λ)/ sinh (η))N .
Operators Ts are often represented alternatively in terms of objects known as Y -

where the boundary condition Y0 = 0 is assumed.

In this article, Hirota equation appears in two diﬀerent (but related) contexts:

(i) as the fusion relation among higher-spin transfer operators Ts and their spectra

and,

(ii) as analytic closed-form description for certain solutions of equilibrium steady states

which arise in the scope of quantum quench applications (cf. Sec. 5.2).

The Hirota equation (2.29), can be understood as a discrete integrable classical
system of its own. A central relation in this regard is the Baxter’s T Q-equation [65–68]

Q = T +

(2.32)

which represents a discrete second-order diﬀerence equation for the fundamental transfer
matrix T1/2. It linearizes the Hirota equation, Eq. (2.29), enabling us to express Ts(λ)
explicitly as a combination of Q-operators

solutions, Q and (cid:101)Q, whose independence requires the Wronksian determinant to be

Since T Q-equation (2.32) is of a second order, it admits two (linearly) independent

non-degenerate,

T0 = Q+(cid:101)Q− − Q−(cid:101)Q+.

By virtue of commutativity of Ts(λ) and Q(µ), for all s ∈ 1

(2.35)
Z+, λ, µ ∈ C, all
previously stated identities can be taken at the level of their eigenvalues. To distinguish
commuting operators from their eigenvalues, we write the latter with the calligraphic
font. Bethe roots λj are by deﬁnition zeros of eigenvalues of Q, i.e. solutions of Q(λ) = 0.

Bethe ansatz equations can be obtained algebraically by eliminating (cid:101)Q through the

2

combination of Eq. (2.32) and the Wronskian condition (2.35), yielding an equation for
the eigenvalues

T −

(2.36)

Similarly, Eq. (2.33) provides a useful decomposition formulae for the spectra of transfer
operators Ts. We shall exploit this fact in Sec. 5.2 to diagonalize them in the large-N
limit.

3. Quasilocal charges from unitary representations

Subsequently we will adopt Eq. (3.3) as a working deﬁnition for deriving quasilocality
of operators Xs(λ). Initially we shall not rely on the aparatus of integrablity but rather
employ an elementary auxiliary transfer matrix technique.

Figure 1. Schematic depiction of a quasilocal charge Xs(λ) for a spin chain composed
of N sites: Each vertex represents a copy of an irreducible spin-s Lax operator Ls. Each
row represents one copy of an auxiliary space Vs, carrying their own rapidity variables
(λ and µ). Horizontal stacking pertains to tensor multiplication with respect to physical
∼= C2, while vertical stacking should be understood as tensor multiplication
spaces V 1
with respect to auxiliary spin spaces (for physical components ordinary multiplication
applies). The dashed lines denote partial tracing with respect to auxiliary spaces Vs.
The upper row is acted upon by the derivative operation ∂µ (magenta), where Leibniz
rule should be assumed. In addition, reducible two-component Lax matrix Ls(λ, µ)
sits on every vertical rung (shown in blue only for 3rd site). Notice that to generate a
quasilocal charge Xs(λ) one has to ﬁnally set µ = λ.

Singlet vector |ψ0(cid:105) obeys ((cid:126)S1 +(cid:126)S2)|ψ0(cid:105) = 0 where (following Ref. [41]) we write auxiliary
spins (cid:126)S1 = ((cid:126)s ⊗ 1s) and (cid:126)S2 = 1s ⊗ (cid:126)s over Vs ⊗ Vs. For the remaining Pauli components
s (λ), α ∈ {x, y, z}, we have

s (λ)|ψ0(cid:105) = 0,
(cid:126)L−

(cid:104)ψ0| (cid:126)L+

s (λ) = 0.

(3.11)

These relations imply that the product state |Ψ0(cid:105) = |ψ0(cid:105) ⊗ |ψ0(cid:105) ∈ V⊗2
eigenvector of Ts,s(cid:48)(λ, λ, µ, µ) with a unit eigenvalue

s(cid:48)

is an

τs,s(cid:48)(λ, λ, µ, µ) = τ 0

s (λ)τ 0

s(cid:48)(µ) = 1.

(3.12)

The last step to perform in order to show that the expression (3.9) is ﬁnite, is to
rigorously show that τs,s(cid:48)(λ, λ, µ, µ) = 1 is indeed the leading eigenvalue. This statement
can be formulated by deﬁning

Fs,s(cid:48)(λ, µ) = 1 − Ts,s(cid:48)(λ, λ, µ, µ)

(3.13)

and proving that it is a positive-deﬁnite operator on the orthogonal complement of the
singlet state |Ψ0(cid:105).

Although the derivation until this point applies for the entire regime ∆ ≥ 1, we
proceed by treating the isotropic case where manifest SU (2) invariance of Fs,s(cid:48)(λ, µ)
makes the task of demonstrating that Eq. (3.13) is a contracting map a lot easier. By
virtue of the SU (2) symmetry of L+0
s (λ, µ) we readily express it by means of the Casimir

from where we conclude that the eigenvalues are

(3.15)
while the dominating vector is clearly the spin singlet state |Ψ0(cid:105). A complete proof and
further details on this part are presented in Ref. [41] and the Supplementary material
attached to it.

j = 0, 1, . . . 2s

Note that factorizability of the leading eigenvalue Eq. (3.12) indeed implies the
inversion identity Eq. (3.2). Similar inversion formulae have been discussed earlier in
the literature [8, 69, 70]. Quasilocality essentially follows as a corollary of Eq. (3.12).
To ﬁnalize the proof it remains to be shown that the kernels Ks,s(cid:48)(λ, µ) given by
Eq. (3.9) are well-deﬁned and can be evaluated directly by taking into account only the
contributions from the leading eigenvalues of auxiliary transfer matrices Ts,s(cid:48)(λ, λ(cid:48), µ, µ(cid:48))
and L±0
s (λ, µ). Applying the ﬁrst order perturbation theory and using factorizability of
the leading eigenvalue results in

Ks,s(cid:48)(λ, µ) =(cid:2)∂λ(cid:48)∂µ(cid:48)τs,s(cid:48)(λ, λ(cid:48), µ, µ(cid:48))(cid:3)

3.1.1. Local operator expansion. An important practical advantage of the present
formulation is that Xs(λ) can be readily expanded in terms of local operators. This
step is of main interest in applications where evaluation of local correlation functions
plays the primary role. To see how this works, we consider the resolution of operators
Xs(λ) with respect to local clusters of r adjacent spins (2.5), by summing over all
projections onto the ﬁnite sublattices of length Λ,

Xs(λ) = lim

(cid:125)

Of course the ‘limits’ have to be understood in the sense as discussed in Sec. 2.1. Here
operators dr(λ) represent projections of Xs(λ) onto local densities with support size
(order) r, where by virtue of Eq. (2.9) the HS norms (cid:107)dr(λ)(cid:107)HS decay exponentially
with r. We note that strictly local charges H (k) are – up to constant prefactors – just
the Taylor coeﬃcients generated by expanding X1/2(λ) around λ = 0.

Due to the factorizability of the leading eigenvalue and the corresponding
[1,k], Xj(λ)) can be eﬃciently computed by introducing

eigenvector, k-point amplitudes (σα
a set of auxiliary vertex operators,

one for each α ∈ J . This allows us to write a matrix product representation

This formula is exact in the thermodynamic limit (N → ∞, see Eq. (3.17)) while in ﬁnite
lattices there are corrections which vanish exponentially in N and can be estimated in
terms of subleading eigenvalues of Ts,s. The boundary vectors in Eq. (3.19) are set as

(3.20)

The reader should notice that, in order to produce a non-vanishing amplitude, the µ-
derivative which is included in the deﬁnition of Xs(λ) (cf. Eq. (3.3)) must necessary act
on the ﬁrst site in the matrix product representation of operators Xj(λ) (see Eq. (3.4))
due to Eq. (3.11).

3.1.2. Computation of Hilbert-Schmidt kernel. Quasilocal charges Xs(λ) are linearly
independent, but not orthogonal with respect to HS inner product. Below we show how
to obtain explicit expressions for kernels Ks,s(cid:48), and use them subsequently to perform
the ‘Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization’. For simplicity we restrict our discussion to the
isotropic point ∆ = 1. There we ﬁnd

(cid:104)ψ0| (cid:126)L−

s (λ) = 2Ns(λ)(cid:104)ψ0| (cid:126)S1,

s (λ)|ψ0(cid:105) = −2Ns(λ)(cid:126)S1 |ψ0(cid:105) ,
(cid:126)L+

(3.21)

while boundary vectors given in Eq. (3.20) can now be chosen symmetrically and take
the form

|ψα(cid:105) =

√
2NsSα

1 |ψ0(cid:105) .

(3.22)

A direct route to evaluate HSK Ks,s(cid:48)(λ, µ) as deﬁned in Eq. (3.16) is to employ
representation Eq. (3.9) and perform a resummation of the geometric series

(cid:104)Ψ| [Ts,s(cid:48)(λ, µ)]k |Ψ(cid:105) = (cid:104)Ψ| (1 − Ts,s(cid:48)(λ, µ))

where |Ψ(cid:105) = (cid:80)

α∈{x,y,z} |ψα(cid:105) ⊗ |ψα(cid:105). In the above sum each term (cid:104)Ψ| [Ts,s(cid:48)(λ, µ)]k |Ψ(cid:105)
actually corresponds to a contribution of density dk(λ) of order-k and is ﬁnite since it
obeys the quasilocality condition. A key point in this calculation is to recognize that the
leading eigenvalues reside in an invariant singlet subspace V0 ⊂ V⊗2
spanned by a
convenient basis V0 = lsp{|j(cid:105) ; j = 0, 1, 2, . . . , 2s}, where |0(cid:105) ≡ |Ψ0(cid:105), |1(cid:105) ≡ |Ψ(cid:105). Noticing
that Fs,s(cid:48) does not couple |Ψ0(cid:105) to the remaining states from V0 allows to cast Eq. (3.16)
expressed as (3.23) in terms of a solutution to a linear system of 2s equations,

3.2. Fusion hierarchy approach

Previously we have highlighted the meaning of the inversion identity Eq. (3.2) and
learned its central role in identifying quasilocal objects.
In this section we explore
a diﬀerent route and show how to consistently retrieve Eq. (3.2) from an algebraic
diagonalization of higher-spin operators Ts(λ).

In Sec. 2.2.2 we have explained how the entire set of canonical T -operators can
be simultaneously diagonalized by means of Baxter’s Q-operator. Assuming that the
large-N behaviour of Eq. (2.33) can be read from the N -dependent scalars ζ2s,k, the sum
is dominated by the term at the extremal index k = 2s,

T +
s (λ)

T [2s+1]

(λ)

N→∞−→ Q[−2s](λ)

Q[2s](λ)

.

(3.31)

This manifestly produces the inversion formula (3.2) on the level of operators. We
therefore expect that the formula (3.31) also makes sense on the level of expectation

values in generic eigenstates. Acknowledging the fact that the algebraic structure
of the T -system remains unaltered upon changing the deformation parameter q, we
immediately learn how to generalize the results of the previous section to the entire
gapped phase without repeating several tedious steps.

In view of Eq. (3.31) we can in addition conclude that the ‘quasilocality domain’
should be analytically continued from the real axis to the whole ‘physical strip’ in the
complex plane,

We note that the charges Xs(λ) are Hermitian for λ ∈ R, but they become non-
Hermitian for Im(λ) (cid:54)= 0.

2 }.
Pη = {λ ∈ C;|Im(λ)| < iη

As a consequence of Eq. (3.31), the anisotropic version of the quasilocal charges (3.1)

admit a useful compact representation in terms of the Q-operator

Xs(λ) = −i∂λ log

Q[−2s](λ)
Q[2s](λ)

,

λ ∈ Pη.

(3.33)

The charges Xs(λ) can now be eﬀectively diagonalized using the fact that eigenvalues
of the Baxter’s Q-operator (denoted by Q(λ)) are q-deformed polynomials with zeros
coinciding with the set of Bethe roots {λj} §,

M(cid:89)

Q(λ) = c

sin (λ − λj),

(3.34)

j=1

where c is an inessential scalar prefactor. At this point the identiﬁcation with the
spectrum of the model has been made, which shall play a central role in the subsequent
discussion on applications in the area of ‘quantum quenches’. Further details are
presented in Sec. 5.2.

3.3. Gapless regime

In this section we generalize the results for the isotropic and gapped cases derived in
the previous section to the gapless phase. Without loss of generality we restrict our
considerations to the positive side of the critical interval ∆ ∈ (0, 1). For technical
reasons we exclude the non-interacting point at ∆ = 0, which due to the exceptional
degeneracy requires a special treatment.

In the gapless regime we introduce a three-parametric family of conserved operators

X(s,u)(λ) = −i∂λ log

T +
(s,u)(λ)
T [j+1]
(0,u) (λ)

,

s = 1

2, 1, . . .

(3.35)

§ Here we ignore a subtle fact that Baxter’s Q-operator becomes singular in the presence of periodic
boundary condition and requires to be regularized in some way [66]. In our formulae Q always appear
in certain ratios which are always well-behaved. Apart from this, we do not rely on an operatorial
construction of Q-operator, but merely use its spectrum which pertains to Bethe string conﬁgurations.

Quasilocal charges in integrable lattice systems

20

An important diﬀerence with respect to the family of charges used in the gapped regime
is that T -operators now acquire another quantum label, the so-called (string) parity
number u ∈ {±1}. The latter merely represents a π/2 displacement of the spectral
parameter in the imaginary direction, namely

T [±k]
(s,u)(λ) = Ts

2 + (1 − u) iπ

4

for λ ∈ Pη.

(3.36)

(cid:0)λ ± k iη

(cid:1)

It is important to stress that operators from Eq. (3.35) do not automatically inherit
quasilocality from the gapped counterparts. While in the present case the structural
form of the solution (2.33) to the Hirota equation is unaﬀected, the scalar functions
should be modiﬁed to

ζ(s,u),k(λ) =

sinh (λ + (2(k − s) + 1) iη

sinh (λ + (2s + 1) iη

2 + (1 − u) iπ
4 )
2 + (1 − u) iπ
4 )

,

k = 0, 1, . . . 2s.

(3.37)

For the inversion identity to hold, the following condition should be satisﬁed

|ζ(s,u),k(λ)| < 1

for k = 0, 1, . . . 2s − 1.

(3.38)

In stark contrast to the gapped (and isotropic) case, given a root of unity
deformation q = exp (iπl/m), only a ﬁnite number of charges with quantum labels
(s, u) satisfy this condition. For instance, for the simple roots of the form η/π = 1/m,
there are precisely m − 1 charges with labels (s, +) for s = 1
2 . On the other
hand, at generic roots of unity identifying the complete set of charges becomes more
involved [71]. To give a ﬂavour, at η/π = 3/7, we have four independent families of
charges corresponding to the set
{X( 1

2 ,+), X(1,+), X(2,−), X(3,+)}.

2, 1, . . . m−1

(3.39)

While the total number of quasilocal charges at a given value of η and their associated
quantum labels might seem a bit arbitrary, at a ﬁrst glance, it is explained below in
Sec. 5.2, that the labels can be matched to the known and well-established quasi-particle
thermodynamic content of the model.

4. Quasilocal charges from non-unitary representations

4.1. Charges from highest-weight representations

Let us remain in the gapless regime and keep the root of unity parametrization of the
anisotropy given as ∆ = cos(η), or q = eiη, with η = πl/m, and l, m ∈ Z+ co-prime.
In what follows, the basic building block of our construction is a reparametrized Lax
operator Eq. (2.22), where for our convenience (and to comply with Refs. [36, 37]) we
perform a rescaling by a factor sinh (η)/ sin (λ) and subsequently make a substitution
η → −iη (but refraining from substituting λ → −iλ as in Sec. 2.2.1). This results in a
purely trigonometric form of the Lax operator:

Ls(λ) =

sin(λ + η sz

the commuting transfer operators are given in accordance with the standard prescription

We moreover owe a remark that in any ﬁnite-N lattice the expression for the conserved
operators Z(λ), as given by Eq. (4.5) without taking the limits and setting Λ = N , in
fact acquires a ﬁnite-size correction

Let us brieﬂy comment on the technical part of what steps have been made to arrive
at Eq. (4.5). Due to translational invariance, each term in the operator expansion of
Eq. (4.3) has been rearranged so that the right-most position in the product of Lax

operators always belongs to the diﬀerentiated Lax operator,(cid:101)L(λ). The trace in ∂sTs(λ)

is then split into two parts, a sum over states |n (cid:54)= 0(cid:105), producing the correction Eq. (4.7),

Quasilocal charges in integrable lattice systems

and the projection onto the ‘vacuum’ |0(cid:105) part which results in Eq. (4.5). Explicit form of

This matrix is contracting when parameters λ and µ lie inside the strip

Quasilocality of conserved operators from Eq. (4.5) is an immediate consequence of this
statement [37]. The reader has to be remainded that we have disregarded the correction
term (4.7). Using an equivalent procedure to the one described above, it can be shown
that the contribution of this term to HSK is exponentially small in the system size [37].
In particular, one must examine the action of T on subspaces of V (m)
, spanned by
elements |n(cid:105) ⊗ |n + k(cid:105), for diﬀerent ﬁxed k. Such decomposition reduces the auxiliary

transfer matrix into the block diagonal form. One can then prove that each block is
itself a contracting matrix.

To calculate (4.9), one needs to solve the linear equation

(1 − T(λ, µ))|ψ(cid:105) = |1(cid:105) ,
for the components ψj = (cid:104)j|ψ(cid:105) of |ψ(cid:105). The ﬁnal result is

The construction from above can also be applied to the case of twisted boundary
conditions. The Hamiltonian then consists of an open boundary part and a two-site
term, acting on the ﬁrst and the last site of the chain

2eiφσ− ⊗ 12N−2 ⊗ σ+ + 2e−iφσ− ⊗ 12N−2 ⊗ σ+ + ∆σz ⊗ 12N−2 ⊗ σz,

(4.14)

introducing a ﬂux parameter φ, such that the φ = 0 case corresponds to the Hamiltonian
with periodic boundary conditions. The transfer operator in case of twisted boundary
conditions takes the following form:

(cid:8)e−iφ sz

sLs(λ)⊗N(cid:9) ,

Ts(λ; φ) = Tra

(4.15)

while the conserved charges are generated similarly as in (4.5), with the prescription
(4.3) but modiﬁcation of the s-derivative: ∂s → ∂s + iφ. Hilbert–Schmidt products of
the type (4.9) remain independent of φ and quasilocality is retained. This concludes the
review of highest-weight conserved charges.

4.2. Charges from semi-cyclic representations

After having discussed how to obtain quasilocal charges from the highest-weight
auxiliary modules, we now turn our attention to another family of representations of
Uq(sl(2)) at roots of unity – the semi-cyclic representations. To this end we retain
s = lsp{|n(cid:105) ; k = 0, ..., m − 1}, but modify the
the m-dimensional auxiliary spaces, V (m)
algebra generators as deﬁned in Eq. (2.25) by addition of an extra coupling:

Here we have introduced a ‘coupling’ parameter α, linking the ﬁrst and the last basis
states.¶ Since the action of ladder operators is periodic only in one direction, such a

nevertheless bear this dependence in mind.

Figure 2. Schematic depiction of construction of a non-unitary quasilocal charge
Z(λ), for the highest-weight (a) and the semi-cyclic (b) case. Each term in the local
operator expansion Eq. (4.5) corresponds to a distinct N -step walk in the directed
graph, starting in red node and ending in blue node. The vertical level n of the node
corresponds to a state in auxiliary space |n(cid:105), while coloured arrows indicate physical
space operator (black σ0, green σz, red σ+, blue σ−) picked at x−th step of the walk,

is given by the product of matrix elements of the corresponding Lax operators between
appropriate auxiliary states (vertical levels of the nodes, indicated on the left).

representation is referred to as semi-cyclic. The algebraic relations Eq. (2.23) are still
satisﬁed.

There are other possible alterations of representations of algebra generators, all of
them resulting in a certain kind of periodicity [5]. In the following we will, for the sake of
simplicity, only consider the above example. Since all other semi-cyclic representations
generate the same quasilocal charges, up to trivial transformations, this means no loss
of generality [39].

As we will see, the coupling of the lowest and highest-weight vectors in V (m)

results
in a family of conserved charges which do not conserve the total magnetization M . Apart
from this, they only exist for odd dimensions m. Let us ﬁrst focus on the latter property,
while the former will become apparent once we provide an explicit parametrization for
these charges.

4.2.1. On the Yang–Baxter relation. The easiest way to observe the nonexistence of
conserved charges generated from semi-cyclic representations is to consider the YBE
over the triple V1/2 ⊗ V1/2 ⊗ Vs. From a direct calculation it follows (see e.g. [44])
that Lax operator Eq. (4.1), together with the corresponding trigonometric R-matrix,
satisﬁes Yang–Baxter equation if and only if the following set of relations holds:

s = q∓1 qsz

(4.17)

Quasilocal charges in integrable lattice systems
25
Here, the diﬀerence in the exponents of Eq. (4.17) and standard Uq(sl(2)) algebraic
relations, Eq. (2.23), is essential [39, 72]. In general, basis vectors |n(cid:105) are eigenvectors
of qsz
s. Let us denote the corresponding eigenvalue with f (n). Using Eq. (4.16) and
condition Eq. (4.17), one produces a recursion relation for the eigenvalue map f ,

f (n + 1) = q−1f (n),
f (m − 1) = qf (0)

(4.18)

which implies qm = 1. This restricts allowed anisotropies to odd m, or more speciﬁcally

2l

for k, l ∈ N, l < k.

π

η =

2k − 1

(4.19)
This set still densely covers the interval of anisotropies ∆ ∈ [−1, 1], but not
symmetrically with respect to ∆ = 0. For example, ∆ = −1/2 (η = 2π/3) is included
while ∆ = 1/2 (η = π/3) is not. This shortcoming can be cured, using a canonical
transformation U = (σz ⊗ 1)⊗N/2, for even N , which ﬂips the sign of the anisotropy
parameter U H(∆)U−1 = H(−∆). This means that if Z is a conserved charge for
anisotropy ∆, then U ZU−1 is conserved for −∆.

4.2.2. Constructing the semi-cyclic charges. We can in fact use the same transfer
matrix as in the case of highest-weight representations, but this time diﬀerentiating it
with respect to the coupling parameter α, at α = 0 and s = 0. We now put

(4.20)

(4.21)

with the only non-trivial component of (cid:101)L being

L(λ) = L0(λ)(cid:12)(cid:12)α=0,
(cid:101)L−(λ) =

(cid:101)L(λ) = ∂αL0(λ)(cid:12)(cid:12)α=0,

sin (η)
sin (λ)

|m − 1(cid:105)(cid:104)0| .

Conserved charges are this time deﬁned as

Z(λ) =

sin2 (λ)
sin2 (η)

s (λ)(cid:12)(cid:12)α=0,s=0,

∂αT sc

[2,r−1] ⊗ σ−, Z(λ)) = (cid:104)L| Lα2(λ)··· Lαr−1(λ)|R(cid:105) ,

Where T sc
s (λ) is the semi-cyclic transfer matrix deﬁned with auxiliary space generators
Eq. (4.16). Once again the formula (4.5) applies, thereby the amplitudes can be
expressed in a canonical way
(σ− ⊗ σα2,...,αr−1
sin η (cid:104)0| L−, |R(cid:105) ≡ sin λ

sin η(cid:101)L− |0(cid:105). The remaining string of Lax components in

with (cid:104)L| ≡ sin λ
the LHS of Eq. (4.22) must connect (cid:104)1| to |m − 1(cid:105) so the second sum in the expansion
Eq. (4.5) actually starts at r = m. Because each term of Z(λ) consists of a surplus of
exactly m operators σ− over operators σ+, these charges do not conserve magnetization
M . A diagrammatic presentation of semi-cyclic Z-charges is shown on Fig. 2 (panel
(b)).

(4.22)

Quasilocal charges in integrable lattice systems

4.2.3. Quasilocality. What remains to be done is to derive the quasilocality property.
The latter follows from a slightly modiﬁed calculation in comparison to the situation
which we had previously with the highest-weight charges. A careful inspection shows
that the same auxiliary transfer matrix as given by Eq. (4.10) for the case of highest
weight representation, can be used to express HSK as

K(λ, µ) = lim
N→∞

(Z(λ), Z(µ)) =

(cid:104)1| (1 − T(λ, µ))−1 |m − 1(cid:105) .

Again, a solution of a simple tridiagonal system (4.12) of equations yields an explicit
expression

K(λ, µ) =

(4.24)
To produce ψm−1 as deﬁned in the previous subsection, the states |1(cid:105) and |m − 1(cid:105) have to
be exchanged. To this end we conjugate Eq. (4.23) and recall that T(λ, µ) is symmetric.

ψm−1 =

sin (λ) sin (µ) sin (λ + µ)
2 sin2 (η) sin (m(λ + µ))

5. Applications

At this stage we ﬁnally arrive at the point where we can discuss various physical
applications of quasilocal conserved charges in the domain of non-equilibrium quantum
physics. Here both classes considered above, i.e. unitary and non-unitary charges, will
be examined. We shall begin with non-unitary Z-charges and show how they directly
relate to non-equilibrium states with currents. On the ﬂip side, unitary X-charges will
play instrumental role for understanding equilibration in quantum quenches. But before
heading on, we need to clarify an important role of spin-reversal parity symmetry and
its breaking.

Spin-reversal and CPT symmetry of generic transfer matrices. To begin with, we
wish to elaborate on an important Z2 symmetry of all ﬁnite-dimensional unitary
representations of the quantum group Uq(sl(2)), and consequently of the XXZ
Hamiltonian itself, which is manifestly broken for non-unitary representations. This
symmetry breaking has some remarkable physical implications which shall be presented
in the following.

The Z2 symmetry, we have in mind, is a parity generated by the spin reversal

transformation

sz → −sz

s± → s∓.

(5.1)

In fundamental representation the latter amounts to the application of the Pauli matrix
σx. Hence, for any observable A on the entire Hilbert space the transformation acts as
A → P AP −1, where

N(cid:89)

x=1

P =

x = P −1,
σx

(5.2)

Quasilocal charges in integrable lattice systems

It is easy to show that all transfer matrices belonging to ﬁnite-dimensional irreducible
unitary representations are manifestly P -invariant,

P Ts(λ)P −1 = Ts(λ),

s ∈ 1

2

Z+,

(5.3)

implying the same property also for the corresponding local and quasilocal charges,

[H (k), P ] = 0,

[Xs(λ), P ] = 0.

(5.4)

For root of unity deformations q = exp(iπl/m) there exists another class of
irreducible representations. These are non-unitary m-dimensional representations of
Uq(sl(2)) discussed previously in Sec. 4. They are distinguished by the property that no
basis exist in which s+ = (s−)T , where T denotes matrix transposition. In the case of
non-unitary representations, which are labelled by a complex-spin parameter s ∈ C, P -
invariance is broken. Transfer matrices generated from the Lax operator Eq. (4.1) and
the quasilocal charges they generate instead exhibit a weaker symmetry,

P T hw

s (λ)P −1 = (T hw

s (π − λ))T , P Z(λ)P −1 = (Z(π − λ))T ,

s ∈ C,

(5.5)

As transposition can be associated with time-reversal operation, while reﬂection of the
spectral parameter λ → π − λ can be thought of as the ‘charge conjugation’ (for
suitable rotated and shifted spectral parameter it would correspond to λ → ¯λ), the
relation Eq. (5.5) can in fact be interpreted as a CPT symmetry of a generic highest
weight quantum transfer matrix. The fact that complex-spin transfer matrices T hw
s (λ)
break spin-reversal symmetry can be fruitfully explored for the analysis of ballistic spin
transport in anisotropic Heisenberg chains as will be demonstrated in the following
Sec. 5.1.

5.1. Mazur bounds on Drude weights

5.1.1. Ballistic linear response. The original motivation for construction of pseudolocal
conservation laws came from considering the possibility of applying such objects to
obtain estimates for the ballistic contribution to transport coeﬃcients, such as Drude
weights or, more generally, zero frequency dynamical susceptibilities [49, 50].

By considering an extensive current J = (cid:80)

is the Kubo-Mori bracket with Zβ = Tr( e−βH) being the partition function. Note that,
in general, the order of limits, namely ﬁrstly the thermodynamic limit N → ∞ and then
t → ∞, in Eq. (5.6) is important. When either A or B is a conserved operator, Eq. (5.7)
simpliﬁes to a thermal state (A, B)β = ωβ(A†B), whereas at high temperatures β → 0,
the overlap (A, B)β ≡ (A, B) reduces to Hilbert–Schmidt inner product Eq. (2.3). The
real part of the spin conductivity is normally split as

(5.9)

Under certain mild assumptions on analyticity of local correlation functions, which
are discussed in Ref. [73], the order of the limits for DJ can in fact be reversed and
using time-invariance of the thermal state ωβ the expression for the Drude weight gets
expressed in terms of time-averaged current as

(5.11)

Nontrivial value of the Drude weight DJ > 0 signals the ballistic (ideal) DC transport
and is equivalent (cf. Eq. (2.7)) to the statement that time-averaged current is a
pseudolocal operator with respect to a Gibbs state ωβ (see also Ref. [51]). One can
thus connect pseudolocality of time-averaged observables to ballistic linear response.

5.1.2. Mazur bound. Computing time-averages of current operators seems a highly
nontrivial task in interacting models. One can instead estimate the Drude weight from
below using a bound due to Mazur [74] and Suzuki [75] in terms of some conserved
Hermitian operator Q, [H, Q] = 0. We start by writing out a nonnegative expectation
value of a positive operator ( ¯J − αQ)2, where α ∈ R is a free parameter,

ωβ( ¯J 2) − 2αωβ(JQ) + α2ωβ(Q2) ≥ 0.

(5.12)

We used the fact that ωβ( ¯JQ) = ωβ(JQ), which is due to the time-invariance of ωβ and
conservation of Q. After optimizing Eq. (5.12) with respect to α, we obtain

(5.13)
Dividing by 2N and taking the limit N → ∞, we produce the Mazur bound on the
Drude weight, which has ﬁrst been pointed out in Ref. [25],

.

ωβ( ¯J 2) ≥ (ωβ(JQ))2
ωβ(Q2)

DJ ≥ lim
N→∞

(ωβ(jQ))2
2N ωβ(Q2)

.

(5.14)

Quasilocal charges in integrable lattice systems
29
The rationale of this is that a conserved pseudolocal operator Q which satisﬁes ωβ(jQ) (cid:54)=
operator Q = (cid:80)
0 implies ballistic transport and consequently allows to put a strict lower bound on the
(cid:80)
Drude weight. For example, by taking a translationally invariant extensive conserved
x S x(q), with density q satisfying ωβ(q2) < ∞, one ﬁnds DJ > 0 if
x ωβ(j ˆS x(q)) (cid:54)= 0, where the last sum always converges due to exponential clustering

of Gibbs states in one dimension [76].

As a further consequence of an eﬀective causality on a locally interacting lattice (i.e.
Lieb-Robinson bounds [47]) one can show that the above Mazur bound holds even if Q
is not exactly conserved on any ﬁnite lattice with open boundaries but the commutator
[H, Q] contains terms localized near the boundary sites (see Ref. [73]).

When dealing with a larger set of pseudolocal conserved operators, say a countable
set {Qk, k = 1, 2 . . .}, the Mazur bound can be further improved. To see how this works,

we study the operator ( ¯J −(cid:80)

k αkQk)2, resulting in
ωβ(jQk)(K−1

DJ ≥ β

(cid:88)

k,l

β )k,lωβ(jQl),

(5.15)

where Kβ is a positive-deﬁnite overlap matrix (Kβ)k,l = limN→∞ 1
N ωβ(QkQl). In this
sense, if the above bound gets saturated for all local currents j, it would be meaningful
to regard the set of pseudolocal charges {Qk} as being complete.
It is presently not
known if such complete sets of pseudolocal conserved operators can be systematically
identiﬁed for interacting models.

In previous sections we have deﬁned and discussed certain continuous families
(rather than discrete sequences) of pseudolocal charges dubbed quasilocal. They
comprised charges Xs(λ) and Z(λ) which were analytic in λ and became quasilocal
when restricted to suitable domains D ⊂ C. Since all Xs(λ) are even under spin
reversal, while the spin current is odd,

P jP −1 = −j,

(5.16)

we immediately conclude that all the charges coming from unitary representations are
irrelevant for the Drude weight, namely ωβ(jXs(λ)) ≡ 0. For this reason we subsequently
consider only the set {Z(λ); λ ∈ D}. Similarly as in the discrete case, we start by
studying the following operator

(5.17)
where the integration is over the domain D. It is worth stressing that in general Z(λ)
are not Hermitian. Nevertheless, the expectation value of B†B is always nonnegative

5.1.3. Spin Drude weight in gapless XXZ chain. The recipe explained above can be
readily demonstrated on a paradigmatic example of the high-temperature spin Drude
weight for the spin current j = i(σ+ ⊗ σ− − σ− ⊗ σ+) in the gapless XXZ model at
roots of unity. There the expression for the kernel reads κ0(λ, λ(cid:48)) = K(¯λ, λ(cid:48)), with the
Hilbert–Schmidt kernel being given by Eq. (4.13). The expression for the spin current
and matrix product formula for the densities of Z(λ) Eqs. (4.5,4.6) yield a simple overlap
function ZJ (λ) = i/4 and the integral equation Eq. 5.23 can be solved, remarkably, by

It is noteworthy that the lower bound Eq. (5.26) agrees exactly with the Thermodynamic
Bethe Ansatz calculation [26,77] at the special – isolated – points of anisotropy η = π/m
corresponding to q−deformation at simple roots of unity (l = 1). Since Thermodynamic
Bethe Ansatz calculation for other values of l seems to be highly non- trivial and has not
yet been performed, we can only conjecture that the bound Eq. 5.26 is in fact saturating
the exact value of thermodynamic high temperature spin Drude weight for a dense set
of commensurate anisotropies ∆ = cos (πl/m). Such a conclusion can also be based on
comparison with Drude weight simulations with state-of-the-art DMRG methods [32,33]
which indicates no signiﬁcant deviations from the lower bound DK [78].

Figure 3. Lower bound on the spin Drude weight DK (black, cf. Eq. (5.26) as
computed in Ref. [36]. In comparison we show (in red) the bound optimized for a single
charge obtained initially in Ref. [29]. In either case the bound exhibits a pronounced
fractal-like (nowhere continuous) dependence on parameter ∆.

5.1.4. Operator time averaging. Observed saturation of spin Drude weight bound
suggests even a stronger conjecture, namely that the set of pseudolocal and quasilocal
conserved charges {Z(λ)} is complete for a class of local observables that are odd
under spin reversal for arbitrary root of unity anisotropy. This would imply that an
exact equality should be reached in (5.18) for the optimal function f (λ) satisfying the
Fredholm equation Eq. (5.23), namely limN→∞(1/N )ωβ(B†B) = 0, which is in a weak
sense – with respect to a thermal state ωβ – equivalent to

(cid:90)

¯J =

d2λf (λ)Z(λ).

(5.27)

Note that one can use the concept of operator time averaging to formally describe
the steady state of XXZ model pierced with a ﬂux φ and undergoing a small ﬂux quench

0.00.20.40.60.81.00.00.20.40.60.81.0(cid:68)DZ,DKQuasilocal charges in integrable lattice systems
32
φ → φ + δφ, namely starting from a thermal density matrix β, one may show [79] that
after-quench current carrying steady state is given by the density operator

¯ = β(1 − δφβ ¯J) + O(δ2
φ).

(5.28)

Furthermore, the concept of time-averaged extensive local operators has been used
to implement a useful numerical algorithm to search for unknown quasilocal charges
of an arbitrary locally-interacting lattice model [80]. One should simply recall that
for any operator O, which is an extensive translationally invariant sum of traceless
local operators, ¯O is by construction a pseudolocal conserved operator, or it vanishes
in a suitable norm if O is ergodic. Taking a maximal linearly independent set of
such local extensive operators {On} up to some maximal order of locality M (cid:28) N ,
enumerated with n = 1 . . .M, M ∼ (d2)M , one can deﬁne a nonnegative deﬁnite
kernel Kn,n(cid:48) = ( ¯On, ¯On(cid:48)) = (On, ¯On(cid:48)). The number of independent pseudolocal conserved
operators ¯On, with eﬀective support not larger than M , can thus be determined as an
eﬀective rank of the matrix K with eigenvectors yielding the quasilocal charges expanded
in {On}. Implementation of this method in the isotropic XXX model [80] gave the ﬁrst
constructive empirical evidence on existence of unitary quasilocal charges Xs [41].

5.2. Quantum quenches

Motivated by recent experimental progress in optical lattices [14–20] and a plethora of
numerical simulations of strongly correlated matter in low dimensions, a very popular
setup studied over the last decade is the problem of a ‘quantum quench’ [81–90]: at
initial time, an ideally isolated (closed) system is prepared in an initial state |Ψ(cid:105), and
subsequently, by a sudden change of interactions, let to evolve according to a unitary
evolution generated by post-quench Hamiltonian H. The situation which is particularly
appealing from the theoretical viewpoint is when H is integrable.

5.2.1.
Complete Generalized Gibbs Ensembles. Understanding the process of
equilibration from the microscopic perspective represented a pivotal topic in this
context [91,92]. While for quantum systems with generic interaction relaxation towards
canonical Gibbs Ensemble is typically explained in the framework of the eigenstate
thermalization hypothesis [93], stating that eigenstates which are close in energy give
approximately the same value of a local correlation function, the situation with
integrable interaction is clearly diﬀerent due to the existence of a large number of local
(and quasilocal) conserved quantities.

It has been conjectured in Ref. [94] that statistical properties of local quantities in
many-particle quantum systems which possess an ‘extensive number’ of conserved local
charges Qn should comply with predictions of a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble [86, 88, 90,
95–97], given by a formal expansion

can be reproduced by the GGE of the form Eq. (5.29), in which case ‘chemical potentials’
βm are to be determined from the value of local charges with respect to the initial
condition.

A great body of work has already been devoted to applicability of the GGE
in non-interacting models [86, 88, 89, 98, 99], and a closely related phenomenon of
prethermalization [17, 96, 100–102].

A validation for the GGE for a truly interacting quantum integrable models required
a bit more eﬀort though. First explicit results were obtained for the case of the Lieb–
Liniger model in Ref. [103], where authors tackle the problem with the so-called quench
action method developed in [104]. This approach invokes a generalized free energy
functional to incorporate restrictions imposed by a particular initial condition in the
form of an exact overlap coeﬃcient. In analogy to the standard Thermodynamic Bethe
Ansatz framework [105–108], the saddle-point solution which represents the sought for
steady-state limit yields a set of coupled integral equations for a set of variational
variables. The latter are, as we shall discuss subsequently, a set of analytic functions
representing Bethe string distributions ρk.

Luckily, for certain simple product states the overlap formulas which enter as an
input to quench action method can be evaluated explicitly in some simple (non-generic)
cases [109]. Two independent studies [27, 28] unambiguously demonstrated that GGEs
built only from hitherto known local charges fail to recover the exact results (see also
Refs. [110, 111]). The failure has been related to the fact that strictly local charges
Eq. (2.27) do not provide the information about distribution of the bound states in
an initial state [112]. These studies signalled the presence of novel (suﬃciently local)
conservation laws in the unitary (or spin-reversal symmetric) sector.

5.2.2. String-charge duality. Here we explain the connection between the spectra of
quasilocal charges Xs and distributions of Bethe strings, following Ref. [71]. This is
achieved by inspecting the large-N behavior of T -operators represented in terms of the
Baxter’s Q-operator [8, 65, 66] using the fact that the spectrum of the Q-operator is a
(deformed) polynomial with roots coinciding with Bethe rapidities. Below we present
the main steps by focusing on the gapped regime.

Bethe equations and string hypothesis. To set the stage we need to brieﬂy describe how
to characterize spectra of integrable lattice models in the thermodynamic regime. The
picture of factorized scattering which has already been highlighted in the introduction
has a central role here. The main object is the elementary S-matrix S1 which for the
XXZ model reads

S1(λ, µ) ≡ S1(λ − µ) =

sin (λ − µ − iη
2 )
sin (λ − µ + iη
2 )

.

(5.31)

Quasilocal charges in integrable lattice systems

34

Parameters λ and µ represent rapidities of the two quasi-particles involved in a scattering
process. For composite objects consisting of j excitations, commonly referred to as j-
strings, a set of fused scattering matrices Sj are introduced

Sj(λ) =

sin (λ − j iη
2 )
sin (λ + j iη
2 )

,

j = 1, 2, . . .

(5.32)

Scattering among two diﬀerent types of strings is governed by string-to-string scattering
matrices which take the form

Sj,k(λ) = S|j−k|(λ)Sj+k(λ)

S2|j−k|+2i(λ).

(5.33)

min(j,k)−1(cid:89)

i=1

With the aid of scattering matrices, the Bethe Ansatz equations, representing a
quantization condition for particle quasi-momenta (rapidities) λj (assuming periodic
boundary conditions), are cast in the form

eip(λj )N

S1,1(λj − λk) = −1,

j = 1, 2, . . . M.

(5.34)

M(cid:89)

k=1

Here M is the number of Bethe roots (related to the magnetization of the eigenstate),
the function p(λ) describes the momentum of an elementary excitation on top of a
ferromagnetic vacuum state,

eip(λ) =

sin (λ + iη
2 )
sin (λ − iη
2 )

.

(5.35)

The string hypothesis [106–108,113] states that in the large-N limit the Bethe roots,
i.e. solutions λj to Eq. (5.34) for a given eigenstate, become equidistantly displaced in
the imaginary direction of the complex rapidity plane,

{λk,j

α } ≡ {λk

α + (k + 1 − 2j) iη

2 |j = 1, 2, . . . k, λk

α ∈ R}.

(5.36)

Such string formations physically correspond to bound states. By partitioning the
Bethe roots in terms of string centre variables λk
α, taking the logarithmic form of Bethe
equations Eq. (5.34), and considering the thermodynamic limit when the string centers
become smoothly distributed along the real axis, the Bethe equations can be cast in the
form of non-linear coupled integral equations of the form [106, 108, 113]

known as the Bethe equations for the strings. The kernels entering the string Bethe

corresponding string-to-string phase shifts
aj(λ) = −i∂λ log Sj(λ),

aj,k(λ) = −i∂λ log Sj,k(λ).

(5.38)

Quasilocal charges in integrable lattice systems

35

in respective order. The main advantage of Eq. (5.37) is that, as opposed to the ﬁnite
volume when we have to deal with a large set of quantized momenta (encoded by Bethe
roots λj), the quasi-momenta take values in the continuum. This allows us to cast the
description in terms of analytic distributions ρj(λ), formally counting the number of
Bethe strings whose centres fall in the interval [λ, λ + ∆λ]. Similarly, ρj(λ) denote the
complementary variables which parametrize distributions of holes (positions of string
centres which are in principle available, but remain unoccupied).

Thermodynamic spectra. To obtain the spectra of charges Xs we make use of
representation Eq. (3.33),

(cid:104){λj}| Xs(λ)|{λj}(cid:105) = −i∂λ log

Q[−2s](λ)
Q[2s](λ)

.

(5.39)

where |{λj}(cid:105) denote a Bethe eigenstate parametrized by a set of roots {λj}. Working
under the ‘string hypothesis’ (cf. Sec. 5.2.2), the spectra of quasilocal charges Xs, deﬁned
as

Xs(λ) = lim
N→∞

1
N

(cid:104){λj}| Xs(λ)|{λj}(cid:105) ,

(5.40)

can be readily expressed in terms of densities of string centers ρj(λ). In particular, by

that

j = 2s ∈ N,

(5.44)

allowing us to interpret Gj,k as a discrete 2D Green’s function. Relation Eq. (5.41)
can be readily inverted, expressing the entire set of density functions ρj(λ) in terms of
spectra of quasilocal charges Xs(λ) as [71]

ρ2s(λ) = (cid:3)Xs(λ).

(5.45)

Quasilocal charges in integrable lattice systems

The distributions of holes ρ2s(λ) can be obtained in a similar fashion [42, 71],

ρ2s = a2s − X +

s − X −
s .

36

(5.46)

In the scope of quantum quench applications, a set of densities ρ2s provides a complete
description of local correlation functions (cf. [111, 114]).
Finally, let us make a brief account on the gapless regime as well. While for |∆| < 1
the string hypothesis still remains valid, having the deformation parameter q = eiη on
the unit circle makes rather cumbersome and technically involved. The string content
for any value of anisotropy in the gapless regime has been derived in Ref. [107]. Due
to limited space we do not attempt to review it here. It however suﬃces to point out
the three major diﬀerences in comparison to the situation in the gapped case: (i) string
conﬁgurations acquire (beside the string length) an additional parity label u ∈ {±1}
(see Sec. 3.3), (ii) the allowed string length depends strongly (and discontinuously) on η,
and (iii) at root of unity value of q the number of allowed distinct string types is ﬁnite.
Moreover, in the spirit of string-charge duality, the number of (dynamical) strings should
still be in a bijective correspondence with the number of quasilocal charges, as discussed
in Sec. 3.3. To complete our example for η = 3π/7, where the charge content is given
by a set Eq. (3.39), we provide the corresponding string content:

(1, +), (1,−), (3, +), (5,−).

Below we explain a computational scheme to determine densities of Bethe roots
from eigenvalues of Xs(λ). This can be done, remarkably, without ever resorting to the
variational approach based on a generalized free energy functional, which is otherwise a
common practice. As we shall see, due to manifest locality of quasilocal charges Xs(λ)
in the spin basis (cf. Eq. (3.3)) this task boils down to making use of rather standard
methodology.

5.2.3. Evaluation of charges.
In this section we address the problem of computing
expectation values of the quasilocal charges with respect to a generic+ pure state |Ψ(cid:105).
While performing this task in full generality remains out of reach at the moment, we
focus on an eﬃcient implementation for a class of matrix product states. In what follows
we essentially recast the results of Refs. [117, 118] in the present formulation.

In order to keep the level of technicality at a minimum, we restrict ourselves to

periodic product states

(5.47)
where |ψ(cid:105) is a state on the block of Np spins and Np ∈ N is the periodicity of the state.
Our aim is to compute

|Ψ(cid:105) = |ψ(cid:105)⊗N/Np ,

X Ψ
s (λ) = lim
N→∞

N

(cid:104)Ψ| Xs(λ)|Ψ(cid:105) .

(5.48)

+ Strictly speaking, we are implicitly assuming that our reference state is ‘local’, i.e. is compatible with
cluster decomposition principle [115,116]. In this case we are able to express |Ψ(cid:105) in the thermodynamic
limit as a single macrostate (string Bethe state).

Quasilocal charges in integrable lattice systems

X Ψ
s (λ) = −i∂µZ Ψ

s (λ, µ)|µ=λ.

We note that partition functions given by Eq. (5.49) are in essence contracted quantum
transfer operators Xs(λ, µ) from Eq. (3.4), depicted on Fig. 1, where in the vertical
direction we project onto components determined by the reference state |ψ(cid:105). The results
of such a vertical contraction over one period Np is the propagator Eq. (5.50).

The construction sketched above can be adapted for general translational invariant

matrix product states (see Refs. [71, 117, 118]).

5.2.4. Closed-form results.
In subsection 2.2.2 we already mentioned that higher-spin
T -operators constitute the canonical solution to Hirota diﬀerence equations (alias the T -
system). Nonetheless, Hirota diﬀerence equations admit other type of solutions as well.
Remarkably, there exist a class of initial conditions, say |Ψ(cid:105), such that the steady state
it relaxes to (parametrized by a collection of density functions ρΨ
j ) can be identiﬁed
with a particular solution to Hirota equations. Two particularly simple examples of
that, often considered in the literature, are given by equilibrium states which have
the following two representative (product) states: (i) a spin-singlet dimerized state
|D(cid:105) = 1√
(|↑↓(cid:105) + |↓↑(cid:105))⊗N/2 and (ii) N´eel state |N(cid:105) = |↑↓(cid:105)⊗N/2. Put diﬀerently, these two
states can be understood as elements of a basin of attraction for generalized equilibrium
states which assume parametrizations in terms of non-canonical solutions to the T -
system.

In what follows we shall use small font to explicitly distinguish non-canonical t- and
q-functions, ts(λ), q(λ), from the canonical objects, Ts(λ) and Q(λ), deﬁned in Sec. 2.2.2
as the fused transfer and Baxter Q−operators. By relaxing the constraint t0 = φ− the
linear auxiliary problem associated to the Hirota equation takes the form

q[2s] − t−

s q[2s+2] = ϕ[2s]q[−2s−2],

and can be explicitly solved in terms of auxiliary Q-functions as

(5.52)

(5.53)

In the present case, q-functions can be considered as auxiliary complex-valued functions
which contain the information about the equilibrium state at hand, closely related to

Quasilocal charges in integrable lattice systems

38

auxiliary functions which enter in non-linear integral equations in the scope of the
Quantum Transfer Matrix (QTM) method [119–121].

To keep things simple, we specialize below only to the isotropic point ∆ = 1. In the
particular case of the dimerized state |D(cid:105) the solution is remarkably simple and reads
qD(λ) = λ2. This results generate the entire tower of t-functions

(5.54)

(5.55)

As we have already explained (cf. Eqs.(5.45), (5.46)), the y-functions are directly

(5.56)

Let us remark that in an actual computation one should in fact work backwards,
namely by computing a few initial values of the charges and employing the string-charge
relationship one can explicitly verify if the y-functions fulﬁl the Y -system hierarchy. It
is not clear to us whether a general or systematic procedure exists to directly determine
which state admits a representation in the form of y-functions which obey canonical Y -
system relations. The analogous expressions for the N´eel state (including the expressions
for the gapped case) are provided in Ref. [71].

To conclude this section, let us stress that the set of charges Xs from the compact
sector are clearly insuﬃcient for characterizing non-equilibrium steady states, i.e. states
which exhibit particle currents. In this situation the quasilocal charges Z(λ) which break
the spin-reversal invariance, have to be accounted for [79,122]. To best of out knowledge,
it remains presently unknown how theses Z-charges act on Bethe eigenstates.

5.3. Steady states of boundary-driven chains

Aside from the linear response theory, quantum transport can also be alternatively
probed by adopting an open system perspective. A simple and eﬃcient framework for
that is to resort to non-unitary evolution equations which are commonly referred to as
quantum master equations. A central concept here is Markovian (time-local) evolution

(t) = e ˆLt(0),

(5.57)

which preserves the trace and positivity of density operators  at any time. The generator
ˆL is of Lindblad form and acts linearly on density matrices as

where H encompasses all interactions attributed to the unitary part of the process, and
the set Ak are the Lindblad ‘jump operators’ which model dissipative processes. For a
comprehensive introduction on the Lindblad equation formalism we refer the reader to
Refs. [123, 124].

In Refs.

[29, 125–130] Lindblad equation has been used to ‘drive’ a quantum
many-body system far from equilibrium. Standard scenarios involve situations where
Lindblad bath operators simulate (a) dephasing noise due to uncontrolled degrees
of freedom in the bulk, or (b) particle/magnetic reservoirs with diﬀerent chemical
potentials/magnetizations attached at system’s boundaries.

While in generic case an adaptation of a time-dependent DMRG technique is
applicable for the Liouville dynamics [131], certain interesting situations permit an
exact analytic description. Non-interacting particles experiencing Gaussian noise can
be treated in a uniﬁed manner within the formalism of ‘third quantization’ [132, 133].
While ﬁnding an exact solution for the full Liouvillian dynamics of an interacting
system remains an open challenge up to date, certain steady states, i.e. ﬁxed points of
Liouvillian dynamics, which allow an eﬃcient matrix product form have been found
and investigated [134, 135].
In some sense one can understand this as quantum
counterparts of their more popular cousins known as classical asymmetric exclusion
processes [136, 137].

For the Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain, a model under scrutiny in this review, driven
2 , the steady state in
by incoherent in/out boundary processes: A1 =
the weak-coupling limit has been constructed ﬁrst in Ref. [29], and later on extended to
the non-perturbative regime in Ref. [127]. What is remarkable, and perhaps somewhat
surprising as well, is that the density operator of the current carrying steady state found
in [29] is a fully mixed state perturbed with an operator of the non-unitary quasilocal
family, namely

(5.59)

The only distinction from conserved operators given by Eq. (4.3) is, that instead of
taking the trace over the auxiliary space, the adequate transfer matrix is now deﬁned
as expectation value in the highest-weight state (vacuum)

expansion of the open boundary charge Z vac is given with the same formula as before,
Eq. (4.5), where the shift ˆS x does no longer act periodically (meaning that the sum over
x runs only up to N − r). While vacuum transfer matrices and the derived quasilocal
s(cid:48) (λ(cid:48))] = 0, and [Z vac(λ), Z vac(λ(cid:48))] = 0,
charges still mutually commute, [T vac

where the Hamiltonian of the anisotropic Heisenberg chain is now taken with open
boundary conditions and b = σz sin(λ) sin(ηs)−σ0 cos(λ) cos(ηs) is a boundary operator.
The ﬁrst identity follows straightforwardly from the RLL relation (2.15), while the
second one follows from the ﬁrst one after taking the derivative ∂s|s=0,λ=π/2. Note that
(5.61) has a form of a conservation law, i.e. time-derivative of Z vac in a ﬁnite volume
equals net surface currents, where the spin density σz
x plays the role of the formal
‘current’.
In spite of ‘almost-conservation’ in a ﬁnite volume, it has been rigorously
shown in Ref. [73], resorting to quasilocality and Lieb–Robinson causality bounds, that
Eq. (5.61) yields a conserved quantity in the thermodynamic limit and in eﬀect provides
an equivalent set of quasilocal conservation laws as those introduced in Sec. 4.1.

Moreover, it can be shown (see [36,127,128], and [12,138] for a review) that vacuum
transfer matrix generates an exact, non-perturbative steady state density operator via
the puriﬁcation ansatz

∞ =

(5.62)

if one sets the spectral parameter and identiﬁes the noise strength Γ with a complex
auxiliary spin s, in either one of the following two ways

,

tan(ηs) =

iΓ

2 sin(η)

or

λ = 0,

cot(ηs) =

iΓ

2 sin(η)

.

(5.63)

These two assignments yield identical steady state density operator (5.62). In light of the
fact that in the canonical σz
x–basis the amplitude operator Ω becomes a strictly upper-
triangular matrix [127], the ansatz (5.62) can also be understood as many-body Cholesky
factorization. The ansatz Eq. (5.62) in fact exactly solves a much larger set of boundary-
driven Lindblad equations, namely taking arbitrary pair of asymmetric (left/right)
noise strengths ΓL,R and adding arbitrary boundary magnetic ﬁelds in z−direction hL,R
uniquely parametrizing two complex variables s, λ (see [12]). We note that notation of
this subsection was adapted for the gapless regime |∆| < 1 which is only relevant for
ballistic transport and quasilocal charges. To have correct expressions for the gapped
regime one has to make a substitution η → iη, or replace trigonometric functions with
the corresponding hyperbolic functions.

It is also perhaps instructive to stress that charges Z vac(λ) are manifestly
nondiagonalizable objects with nontrivial Jordan structure. For example, the spectrum
of Z vac(π/2) only consists of {0}, so it is nilpotent for any ﬁnite volume, but nevertheless
generates highly nontrivial steady state. The approach of generating quasilocal almost-
conserved charges as perturbative solutions to boundary-driven Lindblad equations may
be useful also in other integrable models and should perhaps be further explored in
future.

6. Discussion

6.1. Future prospectives

Spin chains. Even though application of quasilocal conservations laws discussed in this
review have been fully concentrated on the paradigmatic case of the Heisenberg XXZ
model, it is natural to expect that analogous quantities exist for a much broader class of
integrable models (see e.g. Ref. [40] for a recent extension to gapless spin-1 chains). The
simplest extensions should involve quantum lattice models associated with the so-called
fundamental solutions to Yang–Baxter equation, with underlying symmetry algebras
based on higher rank Lie algebras and their quantizations (deformations). Additionally,
supersymmetric cousins (e.g. t − J model, EKS model) shall be of interest in paving
the way towards the celebrated Hubbard model [139–141]. Note that a novel family of
particle-hole symmetry breaking transfer matrices correspondingto non-unitary auxliliay
representations has recently been proposed for the Hubbard model [142], but a posibility
of generating novel quasilocal charges remains to be explored.

In all the above cases it is well-known that the thermodynamic spectra can be
partitioned into Bethe root compounds (strings) describing the bound states. In order
to ensure that generic macrostates (say thermal states and their generalizations) are
mutually distinguishable, the number of distinct particle types needs to be matched
with the number of independent families of (quasi)local charges [60–62, 64, 143, 144].

Another example of an integrable theory which has recently drawn a great deal
of attention due to its experimental signiﬁcance is a Bose gas with δ-like repulsive
interactions, known better as the Lieb–Liniger model [145] (Nonlinear Schr¨odinger
equation in the language of second quantization). Yet, in spite of its wide popularity,
the second-quantized form of the entire tower of local charges have not been obtained so
far [146, 147]. Besides, there also exist certain apparent obstructions related to intrinsic
UV divergencies as discussed in Refs. [103,148], and in Ref. [149] where the authors tried
to overcome the diﬃculties by ‘mildly’ relaxing the conventional requirement of locality.
Alternatively, there is an option to employ a suitable integrable regularization (e.g. by
introducing a UV cutoﬀ) allowing to treat the lattice counterparts in the thermodynamic
limit ﬁrst, then construct/compute the observables, and take the continuum limit only
at the end (see e.g. Ref. [150]). The eﬀectively local, or quasilocal conserved charges
could then be derived using methods presented in this review.

Integrability in AdS/CFT correspondence. One of the hallmarks of theoretical physics
of the last two decades has been the discovery of gauge-gravity dualities [151, 152]. The
most prominent example of this is the celebrated N = 4 superconformal Yang–Mills
theory which is conjectured to be dual to superstring theory [153]. What is striking
is that the Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian arises in the scalar sector as the one-loop
approximation of the dilatation operator. The scattering matrix behind the scenes is
also intimately related to the famous Fermi–Hubbard model mentioned previously, and
some other related models dubbed Shastry–Hubbard models [154]. Constructions and

Quasilocal charges in integrable lattice systems

42

physical applications of quasilocal charges have not yet been envisioned in this context.

Correlation functions.
In this work not much attention has been devoted to the
problem of calculating generic dynamical (time-dependent) correlation functions of
local observables, a task which typically represents an ultimate goal of any successful
computational framework. A systematic procedure to encompass a wide range of
interacting integrable theories in an universal and robust toolbox still awaits to be
developed. A mapping between the string densities and local correlators for the gapped
regime of the XXZ model has been conjectured in Refs. [111, 114].

6.2. Beyond quasilocality

We have discussed at length how a key feature of pseudolocality of certain conserved
charges connects to observable physical properies, such as ballistic (ideal) high-
temperature transport and equilibration to non-thermal states. However, in certain
integrable systems, a normal, diﬀusive high-temperature spin or particle transport
has been observed by numerical simulations, for instance in the gapped Heisenberg
model [125, 126, 131, 155, 156], or half-ﬁlled Fermi-Hubbard model [157, 158].

Diﬀusive high-temperature transport in an integrable model can be considered as
indication of absence of relevant pseudolocal or quasilocal charges with non-vanishing
overlap with the underlying current operator. Namely, in the opposite case, the Mazur
bound would yield ballistic transport. However, one may obtain other interesting bounds
employing conserved operators with possibly diﬀerent volume scaling properties. For
example, if there exists a conservation law Q with quadratic volume scaling of the
Hilbert-Schmidt norm (cid:107)Q(cid:107)2
HS = qN 2 + O(N ), then a rigorous derivation [159], very
similar to a proof of Mazur bound for quantum spin lattice systems [73] but carefully
balancing the limits N → ∞, t → ∞, yields a rigorous lower bound on the diﬀusion
constant

Ddiﬀ ≥ |(j, Q)|2

.

(6.1)

Here j is the corresponding local current operator and v is the Lieb-Robinson velocity
[47, 160]. Simple examples of such bounds have been elaborated in Ref. [159] for the
gapped XXZ and Fermi-Hubbard models, where Q corresponds to level-1 generator
of Yangian symmetry. Systematic exploration of quadratically extensive conserved
charges in integrable systems and their applications to diﬀusive transport and quantum
relaxation has not yet been undertaken.

6.3. Conclusions

This review is devoted to certain types of eﬀective localities in the context of quantum
integrable lattice models termed pseudolocality and quasilocality. The notion of locality
indisputably plays a monumental role in the foundations of statistical mechanics, both
on classical and quantum level. We have presented and exempliﬁed the meaning

Quasilocal charges in integrable lattice systems

43

of quasilocal conserved quantities by discussing various applications to non-ergodic
phenomena in a paradigmatic interacting system, the anisotropic Heisenberg model.
Speciﬁcally, we have elaborated on the importance of quasilocal charges in the
description of generalized (non-thermal) equilibria on one end, and their vital role
for understanding certain anomalous transport characteristics such as inﬁnite high-
temprature spin conductivity on the other.

A key observation is that statistical ensembles given by reduced density matrices
which emerge in the steady-state limit after a relaxation process starting from any
‘physical’
initial state, are, due to eﬀective dephasing, only capable of retaining
that information about the initial condition which is engraved in local or quasilocal
conservation laws. Identiﬁcation of a complete set of such quasilocal charges provides
us with a complete description of local correlation functions in generalized equilibria.

This naturally brings us to an elusive question we posted at the beginning, namely
the controversy regarding the proper counting of degrees of freedom in an integrable
lattice model. We have seen that in the thermodynamic limit the spectrum organizes in
an astounding way and permits for a single quasi-particle description [53, 105, 106, 113],
be it a generalized equilibrium state or elementary quasi-particle excitations on top of
it [161]. These quasi-particles are labelled by a representation label (auxiliary spin in
our example) and a continuous rapidity variable (corresponding to quasi-momentum).
This on one hand nicely conforms with the fact that higher-spin transfer operators,
despite fulﬁlling a system of functional identities, are nonetheless linearly independent,
while on the other hand explains why the naive proposal of matching the number of
degrees of freedom with the number of local Hilbert spaces of the lattice system cannot
be correct.

We have furthermore discussed an interesting though somewhat atypical situation
when the above picture has to be appropriately extended. This happens when the
underlying symmetry algebra becomes enlarged and the spectrum of the model exhibits
extra degeneracies. This is known to occur in the gapless regime of the XXZ model,
governed by Uq(sl(2)) quantum symmetry at root of unity deformations. An enriched
symmetry led to the discovery of an extra family of quasilocal charges pertaining to
non-unitary representations of quantum group. In this review we exposed some of their
implications on non-decaying currents and associated anomalous transport properties
and presented a rigorous non-trivial bound on the singular contribution to the spin
conductivity (Drude weight).

The last application we have shortly outlined were integrable spin chains subjected
to Markovian dissipative boundaries. Time-evolution in such a case is governed by a
non-unitary process described by Lindblad master equation and generally leads to a
unique steady state far from canonical thermal equilibrium. We owe to stress however
that ‘integrable instances’ which emerge in such scenarios can be quite diﬀerent from
other conventional non-equilibrium settings, and thus the relevant class of symmetries
is expected to diﬀer as well: not only because unitarity of time-evolution is explicitly
broken and thus fundamentally diﬀerent, but also because the dissipation process is only

insights presented in this review,

In parallel to a few fresh theoretical

it is
worthwhile remarking that our formulation can also prove advantageous from a practical
computational standpoint. Here we have in mind explicit matrix product representations
of quasilocal charges Xs(λ) and Z(λ) which can be cast on an abstract level in a uniform
fashion and enable direct and eﬃcient computation using the standard statistical
mechanics toolbox. This in essence lifts the Bethe ansatz concepts to operator level
right away in the thermodynamic regime, circumventing a long-standing challenge of
achieving this by pursuing the programme of algebraic Bethe ansatz, see e.g. [162, 163].
Aside of several successful applications in the realm of quantum quenches and
quantum transport, much of the formal origin and group-theoretic interpretation is
still missing at the moment, wrapping the whole story in a pleasant misty atmosphere.
In particular, apart from a question on completeness of the family of Z-charges, it is
not even clear whether these can be reconciled with the quasi-particle picture. One may
hope that this will stimulate further eﬀorts to address and understand these perspectives
in a cohesive and uniﬁed way.
