We calculate the equation of state of strange quark matter and the interior structure of strange quark stars in
a Dyson-Schwinger quark model within rainbow or Ball-Chiu vertex approximation. We emphasize constraints
on the parameter space of the model due to stability conditions of ordinary nuclear matter. Respecting these
constraints, we ﬁnd that the maximum mass of strange quark stars is about 1.9 solar masses, and typical radii
are 9–11 km. We obtain an energy release as large as 3.6 ×1053 erg from conversion of neutron stars into strange
quark stars.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The hypothesis of stable strange quark matter (SQM) and
strange quark stars (SQSs) has been attracting wide interest
since the classical work by Witten [1]. It was demonstrated
that in a wide region of the MIT bag model parameter space,
SQM, but not nuclear matter, could form the ground state of
baryonic matter [2]. Since then the strange matter hypothe-
sis has been addressed in numerous articles, see [3–5] for an
overview.

The most probable way to observe SQM is in compact stars.
Compact stars built entirely of quark matter (QM) were ﬁrst
considered by Itoh [6], assuming an equation of state (EOS)
of a free degenerate Fermi gas of u,d,s quarks with equal
masses. After Itoh’s work, the structure of SQSs was stud-
ied in detail in MIT-bag-type models, taking into account the
strange quark mass, the lowest-order correction from the QCD
interaction, etc. [7, 8]. More work on the EOS of SQM, the
formation of SQSs, their neutrino emission, rotation, superﬂu-
idity, pulsations, electromagnetic radiation, and cooling were
also done, see the reviews [3, 4, 9, 10]. QM in the interior of
massive neutron stars (NSs) is one of the current main issues
in the physics of compact stars, due to the recent observations
of two NSs of about two solar masses [11, 12].

The EOS of QM is crucial for the study of SQM and SQSs.
Some work has been done to go beyond the MIT bag model,
e.g., using perturbative QCD [13], the Nambu-Jona-Lasino
model [14] or the quasi-particle model [15, 16]. However, the
EOS is still poorly known due to the nonperturbative charac-
ter of QCD. The Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSE) provide
a continuum approach to QCD that can simultaneously ad-
dress both conﬁnement and dynamical chiral symmetry break-
ing [17, 18]. They have been applied with success to hadron
physics in vacuum [19–22] and to QCD at nonzero chemical
potential and temperature [23–27].

In this paper, we use a Dyson-Schwinger model (DSM) for
QM based on our previous work [28, 29], in which the hadron-

∗ huanchen@cug.edu.cn

quark phase transition in compact stars and the structure of
hybrid stars were investigated, in combination with a nuclear
matter EOS within the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (BHF) many-
body approach [30–34]. However, there are still free parame-
ters due to uncertainties of the gluon propagator and vacuum
pressure in our model, and we will scan its parameter space to
investigate the possibility of SQM and SQSs.

The paper is organized as follows. In section II we brieﬂy
discuss the DSM for QM and the parameters in our model.
In section III A we analyze the allowed parameter space for
stable SQM, and the corresponding EOS. In section III B we
present results on the structure of SQSs, as well as the en-
ergy release from conversion of NSs into SQSs. Section IV
contains our conclusions.

II. FORMALISM: QUARK MATTER WITH THE

DYSON-SCHWINGER MODEL

For cold dense QM, we adopt a model based on the DSE of
the quark propagator, described in detail in our previous pa-
pers [28, 29]. In the following, we only give a brief introduc-
tion to the model. We start from the gap equation for the quark
propagator S(p; m ) at ﬁnite chemical potential m ≡ m q = m B/3,

S (p; m ) = Z d4q

where l a are the Gell-Mann matrices, g(m ) is the cou-

pling strength, Drs
s (q, p; m ) the dressed quark-gluon vertex at ﬁnite chemical
potential. To solve the equation, one requires an ansatz for
both Drs

and G

s .

For the quark-gluon vertex G

s , three forms were investi-
gated in our previous work [29]: (1) the bare vertex, also
called rainbow (RB) approximation. (2) the Ball-Chiu (BC)
vertex, which satisﬁes the Ward-Takahashi identity of QED
and is free of kinetic singularity. The form of the BC vertex in
vacuum was given in [35], and was extended to ﬁnite chemical

potential in [26]. (3) the 1BC vertex, which includes only part
of the BC vertex, but is numerically quite similar to the RB
approximation. Therefore, in this work we will only present
results with the RB and BC approximations.

For the gluon propagator, we employ the Landau-gauge
form with an infrared-dominant interaction modiﬁed by the
quark chemical potential [28, 36]

The parameters w
and d can be obtained by ﬁtting meson
properties and chiral condensate in vacuum [21, 37], and we
use w = 0.5 GeV, d = 1 GeV2 (with RB), d = 0.5 GeV2
(with BC). We choose the quark masses mu,d = 0 and ms =
115 MeV. The phenomenological parameter a
is of partic-
ular importance in our work, since it represents a reduction
rate of the effective interaction with increasing chemical po-
tential. However, it cannot yet be ﬁxed independently. Ob-
viously, a = ¥
corresponds to a noninteracting system at ﬁ-
nite chemical potential, i.e., a simple version of the MIT bag
model, but in previous and present work we investigate the
full parameter space 0 < a < ¥

.

All the relevant thermodynamical quantities of cold QM
can be computed from the quark propagator at ﬁnite chemical
potential, except a boundary value of the pressure P, which is
represented by a phenomenological bag constant BDS,

where the density distributions nq are obtained from the quark
propagator, see Refs. [26, 28, 38]. It is another parameter that
we introduce to study the dense system. In previous work, we
used a ﬁxed phenomenological value BDS = 90 MeVfm−3,
while in this paper we allow a free variation of BDS. (In the
following, BDS is always given in units of MeVfm−3 in the
text and ﬁgures.)

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Stability of strange quark matter

Since SQM would probably appear in the form of SQSs [1],
we investigate in the following NS matter, i.e., cold, neutrino-
free, charge-neutral, and beta-stable SQM [28], characterized
by two degrees of freedom, the baryon and charge chemical
potentials m B and m Q. The corresponding equations are

m i = bim B + qim Q ,

qir i = 0 ,

In Fig. 1 we ﬁrst illustrate the corresponding EOS P(m B)
in our DSM with the RB approximation (‘uds’, dashed red
curves) with various typical values of the parameters a and

BDS (different panels RBa -BDS), in comparison with the EOS
of two-ﬂavor QM (2QM) (‘ud’, dotted blue curves), as well
as that of hadronic nuclear matter from the Brueckner-Bethe-
Goldstone theory with the Bonn-B potential [34] (‘BOB’,
solid black curve). At given chemical potential m B, the physi-
cally realized phase is the one with the highest pressure P.
With a parameter a = 2 (upper panels), i.e., a moderate re-
duction rate of the interaction strength, strange quarks appear
only at very large chemical potential due to their large dy-
namical mass. In such cases, stable matter with zero pressure
can only be 2QM (upper left panel) for a small effective bag
constant BDS, or nuclear matter (upper right panel) for a large
BDS. An increasing value of BDS reduces the stability of QM.
With a large reduction rate of the interaction strength, a =
10 (lower panels), the dynamical mass of strange quarks de-
creases quickly and they can appear at small chemical poten-
tial. In such cases, if BDS is too small (lower left panel), nu-
clear matter at P = 0 would be instable against 2QM, which
is inconsistent with physical reality. When BDS is too large
(lower right panel), at P = 0 nuclear matter would be stable
against 2QM, but also against SQM. In all the above cases,
the hypothesis of SQM would not be valid.

However, the parameters a and BDS cannot be chosen arbi-
trarily, but are subject to severe constraints due to the fact that
ordinary stable baryonic matter in our world is non-strange
nuclear matter. We therefore have at least two quantitative
constraints on the 2QM,

obtained from the stability of symmetric nuclear matter (S)
and neutral nuclear (neutron) matter (N) [5]. These two con-
ditions enforce lower bounds on the parameter BDS for each
a . On the other hand, for the hypothesis of SQM to be valid,
SQM should be stable with respect to ordinary nuclear matter

which determines an upper bound on the parameter BDS for
each a .
These constraints on the parameters BDS and a are visu-
alized in Fig. 2, where the shaded area contains the param-
eters (a ,BDS) that produce SQM according to Eq. (6) (up-
per dashed red boundary curve), while respecting the stability
conditions Eqs. (5a,b) (lower dash-dotted green and dash-dot-
dotted yellow boundary curves). One can see that these two
lower boundary lines are quite close to each other. In fact,
even if we tighten the stability constraint and demand sym-
metric nuclear matter to remain in the nucleonic (BHF BOB)
phase up to 3 times saturation density (dotted blue curve) the
lower boundary does not change very much.

Comparing the RB (top panel) and BC (bottom panel) ap-
proximations, the allowed parameter space is a little larger in
the latter case: One notes the absolute parameter bounds for
possible SQM a > 3.6, 50 < BDS < 81 (RB) and a > 2.1,
53 < BDS < 81 (BC), established by the ﬁgure. In the MIT
limit (a −1 = 0) the bounds are 59 < BDS < 81, and assum-
ing massless strange quarks, one obtains 59 < BDS < 92 [5].
From the plot one may conclude that an increasing interaction
strength in the DSM effectively reduces the stability of QM,
such that only small values of BDS are permitted for increasing

a −1. In particular, the DSM without in-medium dampening
of the interaction (a = 0) does not allow SQM, as it does nei-
ther provide the possibility of hybrid NSs [28].

The lower boundaries in Fig. 2 represent universal stability
conditions of ordinary nuclear matter that have to be respected
by any quark model, whether modeling SQSs or ordinary (hy-
brid) quark NSs. In the latter case, there is a different upper
limit Bmax, beyond which a transition to QM does not occur
any more even for the heaviest NSs, i.e., hybrid NSs cannot
be formed at all with the given quark model. This upper limit
depends obviously on the chosen hadronic EOS and is much
larger than the upper limit for the SQM phase, because the rel-
evant phase transition might occur at very large pressure. In
fact, in the case of the BOB EOS for the hadronic phase, this
upper limit is beyond any reasonable range of the bag con-
stant. For the same reason, the lower limit on the parameter a
is much lower for ordinary hybrid stars than for SQSs, e.g., in
Ref. [28] an a min ≈ 0.5 was considered.

Having determined the possible parameter values a

and
BDS, we illustrate a typical result in Fig. 3, which shows the
low-density EOS of symmetric nuclear matter (BOB,S), sym-
metric SQM (uds,S), and symmetric (ud,S) and neutral (ud,N)
2QM. The RB approximation and the parameter values a = 8,
BDS = 60 (see the black square marker in Fig. 2) are used.

B. Structure of strange quark stars

The relevant EOS for SQSs is the one of beta-stable and
charge-neutral SQM, comprising a small electron fraction due
to the ﬁnite strange quark mass, and we present that EOS in
the form P(r B) in Fig. 4(top) for both the RB and BC mod-
els. In each case, we choose three sets of parameters (a ,BDS),
corresponding to the three extreme points of the allowed re-
gions in Fig. 2. Note that two of these point (MIT limit) co-
incide for RB and BC model. For comparison, the nuclear

relations of SQSs (M⊙ = 2 × 1033g). See text for details.

BHF EOS is also shown. Different from nuclear matter, SQM
approaches nonzero densities of about 0.25–0.4 fm−3 at zero
pressure. These are the surface densities of the corresponding
SQSs, which decrease with decreasing BDS, i.e., increasing
stability of QM. At higher densities, the pressure (and energy
density) of SQM is much lower than that of nuclear matter.

With these EOSs we calculate the structure of bare SQSs.
We treat a SQS as a spherically symmetric distribution of
mass in hydrostatic equilibrium and obtain the stellar radius
R and the gravitational mass M by the standard procedure of
solving the TOV equations [39]. We assume SQSs without
crust, whereas for NSs we employ the BOB high-density BHF
EOS joined with the ones by Negele and Vautherin [40] in the
medium-density regime, and by Feynman-Metropolis-Teller
[41] and Baym-Pethick-Sutherland [42] for the outer crust.

The results are shown in the lower panels of Fig. 4. The left
(right) panel shows the star’s gravitational mass dependent on
the central baryon density (radius). Two of the quark model
curves coincide with the MIT model, and in fact the conﬁgu-
ration with minimum BDS provides the largest maximum mass
and radius of all EOSs. Increasing the bag constant or main-
taining interacting quarks with ﬁnite a −1, reduces effectively
the binding of QM and thus the values of the above physical
quantities. In the lower right panel of Fig. 4, we ﬁnd that typ-
ical radii of SQSs heavier than one solar mass are 10–11 km,
a bit smaller than hadronic NS radii 11–13 km, but close to a
recent analysis on observed compact stars [43]. Compared to
other quark models [13, 15], we obtain a much smaller range

of possible radii and maximum masses of SQSs. This is due
to the lower bound on the parameter BDS from the constraint
Eq. (5). For lower values of BDS larger SQS masses can be
reached, but the stability condition of ordinary nuclear matter
is violated.

The single most relevant number characterizing a given NS
model is probably the maximum mass, in view of the recent
observation of heavy NSs [11, 12]. In order to address this is-
sue, we show in Fig. 5 the maximum mass of SQSs for the al-
lowed values of parameters (a ,BDS), as determined in Fig. 2.
In general for ﬁxed a
the maximum mass increases with de-
creasing value of the bag constant (increasing binding of QM),
and the globally largest value, Mmax ≈ 1.9 M⊙, is found in the
MIT limit (a −1 = 0) with the smallest possible bag constant
Bmin = 59. This value is smaller than the currently observed
largest mass of compact stars [11, 12].

In comparison with SQSs, the maximum mass of hybrid
NSs can be much larger at larger BDS and/or smaller a
[28, 29]. Due to the fact that a very stiff nuclear EOS (BOB)
was used for their construction, in this case large maximum
masses of about 2.5 M⊙ can be reached, which correspond
to conﬁgurations where QM is only present in the very core
of the star. However, this result cannot resolve the ‘hyperon
puzzle’ [33, 44], which would impede the existence of heavy
hadronic or hybrid NSs, where QM only appears at very large
density. We leave detailed discussions of different realisations

of hybrid NSs and their behavior in the whole parameter space
to future work.

C. Conversion of neutron stars into strange quark stars

As a last application, we consider the formation of a SQS
from a pure metastable NS, which might occur once and if an
initial seed of SQM has been formed in one of several hypo-
thetical ways [8, 45], for example in a two-step phase tran-
sition of nuclear matter to 2QM to SQM [46, 47], or in the
combustion of hot nuclear matter [48].

This transition is accompanied by a huge energy release,
which could be associated with the long gamma-ray bursts
[49, 50] or the two-neutrino-burst scenario supernovas [51].
Here we simply assume that the total baryon number is con-
served during the transition; then the energy release can be
obtained from the mass difference between the pure NS and
the SQS with the same total baryon number.

In Fig. 6 we show the relation between gravitational mass
M and baryonic mass MB of pure NSs and SQSs (upper panel)
and the energy release Er in the conversion of NSs into SQSs
with baryon number conservation (lower panel). The energy
release depends on the DSM parameters and for a typical NS

5

with M = 1.4 M⊙ can be (0.8–2.5)×1053erg, the maximum
value of which is obtained for the MIT case (a −1 = 0) with
minimum value of the bag constant, i.e., for the strongest
bound SQS, which also allows the largest maximum mass of
SQSs, see Fig. 4.

These results are quantitatively similar to others in the
literature, e.g., a range of (1–4)×1053 erg was obtained in
Ref. [50]. As the NS mass increases, the energy release in
the conversion also increases, up to 3.6 × 1053 erg for a NS
with M = 2.1 M⊙ and the SQS obtained from the MIT-B59
case. For NSs with even larger masses, M ≈ (2.1–2.5) M⊙,
there are no SQSs corresponding to the same baryon num-
ber. Therefore, it is impossible to convert such heavy NSs into
SQSs with baryon number conservation, and they can only be
converted into SQSs with a big loss of baryons, or into black
holes.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have investigated SQM and SQSs in our DSM for QM.
For the hypothesis of SQM to be valid, i.e., SQM being sta-
ble against nuclear matter, while the latter is stable against
2QM, we obtained the allowed parameter space of a and BDS
in our DSM with RB or BC vertex. We found that SQM ex-
ists only for a sufﬁciently strong damping of the in-medium
gluon propagator, expressed by a lower limit on the parameter
a . The strongest bound conﬁgurations correspond to the MIT
bag-model limit, i.e., a vanishing in-medium gluon propaga-
tor, with a minimal value of the bag constant.

Outside the SQM parameter limits, hybrid two- or three-
ﬂavor NSs may exist in a much larger domain of parameter
space, because in this case the upper limit on BDS is estab-
lished by a hadron-quark phase transition at high density in
the NS core. Metastable two-ﬂavor hybrid NSs may even co-
exist with SQSs. We will study these aspects in future work.
Then, in the allowed parameter space, we calculated the
EOS of SQM and the corresponding structure of SQSs. We
found that the maximum mass of SQSs is about 1.9 M⊙ and
typical radii are 9–11 km, while maximum masses of ordi-
nary (hybrid) NSs are 2.5 M⊙ and 11–13 km, depending on
the hadronic EOS, though. We ﬁnally discussed the formation
of SQSs due to the conversion from NSs and obtained energy
releases as large as 3.6 × 1053 erg.

For the future it will be important to establish direct esti-
mates of the model parameters in a more fundamental way
from QCD.
