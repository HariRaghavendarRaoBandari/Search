SPECTRALLY UNSTABLE DOMAINS

GERARDO A. MENDOZA

Abstract. Let H be a separable Hilbert space, Ac : Dc ⊂ H → H a densely
deﬁned unbounded operator, bounded from below, let Dmin be the domain
of the closure of Ac and Dmax that of the adjoint. Assume that Dmax with
the graph norm is compactly contained in H and that Dmin has ﬁnite positive
codimension in Dmax. Then the set of domains of selfadjoint extensions of Ac
has the structure of a ﬁnite-dimensional manifold SA and the spectrum of each
of its selfadjoint extensions is bounded from below. If ζ is strictly below the
spectrum of A with a given domain D0 ∈ SA, then ζ is not in the spectrum
of A with domain D ∈ SA near D0. But SA contains elements D0 with the
property that for every neighborhood U of D0 and every ζ ∈ R there is D ∈ U
such that spec(AD)∩(−∞, ζ) 6= ∅. We characterize these “spectrally unstable”
domains as being those satisfying a nontrivial relation with the domain of the
Friedrichs extension of Ac.

Throughout the paper, H is a separable Hilbert space,

is a densely deﬁned unbounded operator which is semibounded from below, and

Ac : Dc ⊂ H → H

(1.1)

A : Dmax ⊂ H → H

is the adjoint operator, automatically an extension of the symmetric operator (1.1).

The space Dmax is a Hilbert space with the inner product

(u, v)A = (Au, Av) + (u, v),

u, v ∈ Dmax

(1.2)

where the inner product on the right is that of H. It is further assumed that the
inclusion Dmax ֒→ H is compact and that Dmin, the domain of the closure of (1.1)
(the closure of Dc in Dmax) has ﬁnite positive codimension in Dmax.

With these assumptions, all closed extensions of (1.1) are Fredholm and the
set of domains of extensions with index 0 can be parametrized by the elements
of a compact manifold (a Grassmannian) in which the domains of the selfadjoint
extensions form a smooth compact submanifold SA.
It is a fact that all these
selfadjoint extensions have discrete spectrum bounded from below. (See Section 2
for details.) Write AD for the operator with domain D. The assertion that
every D0 ∈ SA has a neighborhood U0 for which there is C0 ∈ R such
that D ∈ U0 =⇒ spec(AD) ⊂ {λ : ℜλ > C0}

is false. Namely, if it were to hold, then SA, being compact, would admit a ﬁnite
cover by open sets Uj such that the spectrum of AD is bounded from below by the
same constant in each set Uj. Hence there would be an absolute lower bound for
the spectra of all selfadjoint extensions, which is not true (see Lemma 2.10 below).
So in fact there is D0 ∈ SA such that

for every neighborhood U of D0 and every ζ ∈ R there is D ∈ U such
that spec(AD) ∩ (−∞, ζ) 6= ∅.

(1.3)

Such domains will be called spectrally unstable. The main purpose of this paper
is to establish the following characterization of these domains (proof in Section 7):

Theorem 1.4. Let DF ∈ SA be the domain of the Friedrichs extension of (1.1).
The element D ∈ SA is spectrally unstable if and only if (D ∩ DF )/Dmin 6= 0.

Viewing the problem from the perspective of the von Neumann theory [8] (see
[9, Theorem X.2]), let K±i = ker(ADmax ∓ i). With the assumptions of the ﬁrst
two paragraphs above, these subspaces of H have the same ﬁnite dimension. Let
D0 ∈ SA. The spectrum of UD0 = (AD0 − i)(AD0 + i)−1, the Cayley transform
of AD0, consists of 1 and a discrete subset of the circle S1 ⊂ C. The part of the
spectrum of UD0 in ℑλ < 0 accumulates at 1, and so the fact that arbitrarily small
perturbations of D0 to D ∈ SA can lead to an apparently spontaneous generation
of spectrum of AD arbitrarily close to −∞ is not surprising. What Theorem 1.4
does, is characterize those domains D0 for which arbitrarily small perturbations
lead to spectrum of the Cayley transform spilling over from ℑλ ≤ 0 to ℑλ > 0
across 1.

Note in passing that for no D ∈ SA can the part of the spectrum of UD on the
semicircle in ℑλ > 0 accumulate at 1, since the spectrum of any AD is bounded
below by [1, Theorem 7, pg. 217], quoted here as Theorem 2.11.

The key technical results are a very simple “regularity” result, Proposition 4.1,
and Theorem 6.9, a statement concerning recovering the essential part of the domain
of the Friedrichs extension as a limit of spaces associated with ker(ADmax − λ).
To describe these more precisely let E be the orthogonal complement of Dmin in
Dmax and πmax the orthogonal projection on E, all with the inner product (1.2).
Domains of closed extensions of (1.1) correspond to the various subspaces D ⊂ E
via D = D + Dmin, with selfadjoint extensions corresponding to the points of a
submanifold SA of the Grassmannian of subspaces of E of a certain dimension (so
it is not DF that belongs to SA in Theorem 1.4, but a certain subspace DF ⊂ E).
Let Kλ = ker(ADmax − λ) and Kλ = πmaxKλ. Then λ 7→ Kλ is a smooth curve in
SA if λ is suﬃciently negative, and limλ→−∞ Kλ = DF . This is a consequence of
the following. For any domain D = D + Dmin with D ∈ SA and any s ≥ 0 we deﬁne
Hilbert spaces H s
D = D.

operators. The research leading to the papers [5, 6] was the motivation for looking
into the instability issue. Friedrichs deﬁned his extension in [3]. The nature of the
domain in the abstract context was elucidated by Freudenthal in [2].

The author is grateful to T. Krainer for suggestions that improved the manuscript

and for pointing out reference [1].

2. Domains, Selfadjointness

All closed extensions of (1.1) considered here will have as domain a subspace of
Dmax containing Dmin. Thus the domain of every closed extension of (1.1) is of the
form

D = D + Dmin

with D a subspace of the orthogonal complement, E, of Dmin in Dmax with respect
to the inner product (1.2); E is ﬁnite-dimensional by hypothesis. In particular, the
domain of the Friedrichs extension of (1.1) has the form DF = DF + Dmin for some
subspace DF ⊂ E.

The resolvent family of

A : DF ⊂ H → H

consists of compact operators BF (λ) : H → H, since they are also continuous as
operators H → DF and the inclusion DF ֒→ H is compact. It follows that A with
domain Dmin or Dmax is Fredholm, and from this and the ﬁniteness of dim E, that
every closed extension of (1.1) is Fredholm (with compact resolvent when it exists).
It is easily veriﬁed that the index of A with domain D = D + Dmin is

ind AD = ind ADmin + dim D.

(2.1)

Since ADmin − λI is injective for large negative λ, ind ADmin ≤ 0. And since ADmax −
λI is surjective for such λ, ind ADmax ≥ 0. From ind ADmax = ind ADmin + dim E
and ind ADmax = − ind ADmin (because ADmax and ADmin are adjoints of each other)
one derives that dim E = 2d with d = − ind ADmin; this is a positive number since
dim E > 0. One can then view the set of domains of selfadjoint extensions of (1.1)
as

SA = {D ⊂ E : A with domain D + Dmin is selfadjoint},

a subset of Grd(E), the Grassmannian of d-dimensional subspaces of E. As such,
SA is a compact real analytic submanifold of dimension d2 (see Proposition 2.9).

Let

[·, ··]A : Dmax × Dmax → C

denote the skew-Hermitian form

Then [u, v]A = 0 if either u or v belongs to Dmin, so

[u, v]A = (Au, v) − (u, Av).

where

[u, v]A = [πmaxu, πmaxv]A

πmax : Dmax → Dmax

is the orthogonal projection on E. The restriction of the Green form [·, ··]A to E is
non-degenerate because the Hilbert space adjoint of A with domain Dmax is A with
domain Dmin.

4

GERARDO A. MENDOZA

The facts collected in the following lemma can be veriﬁed directly, or following

the arguments in [6, Section 6].

Lemma 2.2. We have

E = {u ∈ Dmax : Au ∈ Dmax and A2u = −u}.

If u ∈ E, then Au ∈ E, and the map

A|E : E → E

is an isometry with inverse −A|E . If u, v ∈ E, then

[u, Av]A = (u, v)A.

Consequently, for any subspace D ⊂ E, the adjoint of

is

A : D + Dmin ⊂ H → H

A : A(D⊥) + Dmin ⊂ H → H

where D⊥ is the orthogonal complement of D in E. Consequently

D ∈ SA ⇐⇒ A(D⊥) = D ⇐⇒ A(D) = D⊥.

and in particular, D ∈ SA =⇒ D⊥ ∈ SA.

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

We discuss the claim about the adjoint. The combination of (2.3) and (2.4) gives

A2|E = −I, so (2.5) can also be written as

[u, v]A = −(u, Av)A.

Suppose D = D + Dmin with D ⊂ E. The domain of the adjoint of AD is D∗ =
D∗ + Dmin for some subspace D∗ ⊂ E. Since ADmin is symmetric, the condition
that v ∈ D∗ reduces to the statement that [u, v]A = 0 for all u ∈ D, equivalently,

v ∈ D∗ ⇐⇒ (u, Av)A = 0 for all u ∈ D.

Thus v ∈ D∗ ⇐⇒ Av ∈ D⊥, and so D∗ = (AD)⊥. Also D = (AD∗)⊥, so
D⊥ = AD∗, and using A2 = −I again we get D∗ = A(D⊥), which gives the
assertion in (2.6).

If D ∈ Grd(E) and T : D → D⊥ is a linear map, then

graph T = {u + T u : u ∈ D} ⊂ E

is again an element of Grd(E). The set UD of all such elements is a neighborhood
of D in Grd(E).

Lemma 2.8. Suppose D ∈ SA. Then

UD ∩ SA = {graph T : the map AT : D → D is selfadjoint}.

Here selfadjoint means with respect to the A-inner product.

Since A|E is unitary, if T : D → D⊥ is such that AT : D → D is selfadjoint,

then also T A : D⊥ → D⊥ is selfadjoint.

SPECTRALLY UNSTABLE DOMAINS

Proof. Let D ∈ SA, let T : D → D⊥ be a linear map.
condition that graph T ∈ SA is that

In view of (2.7), the

(u + T u, A(v + T v))A = 0 for all u, v ∈ D

For a general T : D → D⊥ and u, v ∈ D we have

(u + T u, A(v + T v))A = (u, Av)A + (u, AT v)A + (T u, Av)A + (T u, AT v)A.

Since D ∈ SA and u, v ∈ D, (u, Av)A = 0, and since T u, T v ∈ D⊥ and D⊥ ∈
SA, also (T u, AT v)A = 0. Further, since A is an isometry on E and A2 = −I,
(T u, Av)A = −(AT u, v). Thus

(u + T u, A(v + T v))A = (u, AT v)A − (AT u, v)A

so graph T ∈ SA iﬀ AT : D → D is selfadjoint with respect to the A-inner product.
(cid:3)

Thus SA, as a subset of Grd(E), is structurally simple:

Proposition 2.9 ([6] Proposition 6.3). The set SA is a smooth real-algebraic
subvariety of Grd(E).

The dimension of the vector space of selfadjoint operators D → D (a real vector

space) is d2, so SA is a real submanifold of Grd(E) of dimension d2.

Lemma 2.10 ([6] Proposition 6.4). Every λ ∈ R appears as eigenvalue of some
selfadjoint extension of A.

If ker(ADmin − λ) 6= 0, then λ ∈ spec(AD+Dmin) for every
Proof. Let λ ∈ R.
D ∈ SA, so the lemma holds in this case. Suppose now that ADmin − λ is injective
and let Kλ = ker(ADmax − λ). Then Kλ ∩ Dmin = 0, so Kλ = πmaxKλ has the same
dimension as Kλ. The injectivity of ADmin − λ implies the surjectivity of its adjoint,
ADmax − λ, so the index of the latter, namely d, is equal to the dimension of its
kernel. So Kλ ∈ Grd(E). Let D = Kλ +Dmin. To verify that Kλ ∈ SA let u, v ∈ Kλ
and u0, v0 ∈ Dmin (note that D = Kλ + Dmin). Then [u + u0, v + v0]A = [u, v]A using
that the Hilbert space adjoint of ADmin is ADmax and that ADmin is symmetric. So

[u + u0, v + v0]A = (u, Av) − (Au, v) = (u, λv) − (λu, v) = 0

since λ ∈ R. It follows that AD is symmetric, and from this and ind AD = 0, that
A is selfadjoint.
(cid:3)

We end with the following fundamental fact:

Theorem 2.11. Let m be a lower bound of Ac. Every selfadjoint extension of Ac
is semibounded from below and the part of its spectrum in (−∞, m) is discrete with
at most d eigenvalues counting multiplicity.

This is [1, Theorem 7, pg. 217]. Indeed, in view of the semiboundedness of (1.1),
all we need to verify is that the deﬁciency indices of Ac are ﬁnite and equal. Since Ac
is semibounded from below, ADmin − λ is injective if ℑλ 6= 0 or λ ∈ R is suﬃciently
negative. For such λ, Kλ = ker(ADmax − λ) has constant dimension d, because of
(2.1) and the deﬁnition of d as − ind ADmin. In particular, the spaces Ki and K−i
have the same dimension. But these spaces are the orthogonal complements in H
of the ranges of ADmin + i and ADmin − i. We note in passing that both Ki and K−i
are subspaces of E, with E = Ki ⊕ K−i. This is the decomposition of E into the
eigenspaces of the almost complex structure of E determined by A.

Proof. Let u ∈ D⊥. The functional δu is clearly linear. Its continuity as a map

δu = 0, then (Aψ, u) − (ψ, Au) = 0 for all ψ ∈ D, since D⊥ + Dmin is the domain
of the adjoint of AD. So u belongs to the domain of the adjoint of AD. But since
AD is selfadjoint, we must have u ∈ D, so u = 0. So the map

k=1 be the sequence of eigenvalues of AD repeated according to multiplicity and
in increasing order, and let {ψk} ⊂ D be an orthonormal basis of H corresponding
to these eigenvalues.

The ψk are also a complete A-orthogonal system for D. Therefore, an element

u ∈ Dmax belongs to D⊥ if and only if (u, ψk)A = 0 for all k:

u ∈ D⊥ ⇐⇒ λk(Au, ψk) + (u, ψk) = 0

for all k.

Let u ∈ D⊥. The relations

( λk(u, ψk) − (Au, ψk) = hδu, ψki

pact resolvent, the set bg-spec(A) is (if not empty) a discrete subset of the real line
with only +∞ as a possible point of accumulation, equal to

bg-spec(A) = {λ ∈ C : ADmin − λ is not injective}.

Indeed, if λ ∈ R then ker(ADmin − λ) = rg(ADmax − λ)⊥.

For λ ∈ bg-res(A) deﬁne

Kλ = ker(ADmax − λ).

Since Amin − λ is injective if λ ∈ bg-res(A), formula (2.1) with D = Dmax gives
dim Kλ = d. For these λ, Kλ ∩ Dmin = 0. It follows that Kλ = πmaxKλ also has
dimension d for each λ ∈ bg-spec(A). (These spaces are the ﬁbers of a holomor-
phic vector bundle over bg-res(A) that extends across bg-spec(A) as a holomorphic
vector bundle.)

The following lemma makes explicit the relevancy of these spaces.

Lemma 5.1. Let D ∈ Grd(E). The spectrum of A with domain D = D + Dmin is

{λ ∈ bg-spec(A) : Kλ ∩ D 6= 0} ∪ bg-spec(A).

Indeed, if λ ∈ spec(AD) and λ ∈ bg-res(A), then ker(AD − λ) = D ∩ Kλ 6= 0,

and u ∈ ker(AD − λ) if and only if πmaxu ∈ Kλ and πmaxu ∈ D.

Because of the property expressed in the lemma it is of interest to have a formula
for the spaces Kλ when λ /∈ bg-spec(A). We get one such formula with the aid of
the resolvent of an arbitrary selfadjoint extension AD of (1.1).

Let then D ∈ SA, write πD⊥ , πD : Dmax → Dmax for the A-orthogonal projec-
tions on D⊥ and D, respectively, and let πD : Dmax → Dmax be the orthogonal
projection on D (so πD = 1 − πD⊥). Let BD(λ) be the resolvent of AD. Suppose
λ ∈ res(AD) and φ ∈ Kλ. Then

φ = πD⊥ φ + πDφ

0 = (A − λ)πD⊥ φ + (A − λ)πDφ.

πDφ = −BD(λ)(A − λ)πD⊥ φ

gives

Applying BD(λ) get

since πDφ ∈ D. Thus

φ = πD⊥ φ − BD(λ)(A − λ)πD⊥ φ

Conversely, it is easily veriﬁed that if u ∈ D⊥, then

φu(λ) = u − BD(λ)(A − λ)u

is an element of Kλ for each λ ∈ res(AD). Evidently, the map D⊥ ∋ u 7→ φu(λ) ∈
Kλ is bijective and depends holomorphically on λ /∈ spec(AD).

Using the orthonormal basis {ψk} consisting of eigenfunctions of AD, the formula

BD(λ)f =Xk

the series converges absolutely and uniformly in H 1

Alternatively, again using (4.2) in the expansion of u in terms of the ψk, we have

6. Negativity and regularity

We continue our discussion with the selfadjoint operator AD of the previous
section; so D = D + Dmin with D ∈ SA. Let S : D⊥ → D⊥ be selfadjoint with
respect to the A-inner product, let T = AS : D⊥ → D, and let

graph T = {u + T u : u ∈ D⊥},

which by Lemma 2.8 is an element of SA. Let

DT = graph T + Dmin.

By Lemma 5.1, λ ∈ bg-res(A) belongs to spec(ADT ) if and only if graph T ∩Kλ 6= 0.
In particular, λ ∈ res(AD) belongs to spec(ADT ) if and only if there is u ∈ D⊥,
u 6= 0, such that

u − πmaxBD(λ)(A − λ)u = u + T u,
that is, if and only if −πmaxBD(λ)(A − λ)u = ASu. Setting

FD(λ) = −AπmaxBD(λ)(A − λ)|D⊥ ,

an operator D⊥ → D⊥ we thus have

λ ∈ spec(ADT ) ∩ res(AD) ⇐⇒ FD(λ) + S has nontrivial kernel.

(6.1)

Lemma 6.2. The map FD(λ) satisﬁes

FD(λ)∗ = FD(λ),

λ ∈ res(AD).

(6.3)

In addition, for any λ ∈ res(AD),

(FD(λ)u, u′)A =

Xk=0

hδu, ψkihδu′ , ψki

u, u′ ∈ D⊥.

(6.4)

Proof. Let u, u′ ∈ D⊥. Then

(FD(λ)u, u′)A = (−AπmaxBD(λ)(A − λ)u, u′)A

= (πmaxBD(λ)(A − λ)u, Au′)A = (BD(λ)(A − λ)u, Au′)A (6.5)

where the ﬁrst equality is the deﬁnition of FD(λ), the second because A|E is an
isometry, and the third because E ⊥ Dmin in the A-inner product. Using the
deﬁnition of the A inner product in the last term we thus have

(FD(λ)u, u′)A = (ABD(λ)(A − λ)u, −u′) + (BD(λ)(A − λ)u, Au′)

= ((A − λ)u + λBD(λ)(A − λ)u, −u′) + (BD(λ)(A − λ)u, Au′)
= −((A − λ)u, u′) + (BD(λ)(A − λ)u, (A − λ)u′)

Likewise,

(u, FD(λ)u′)A = −(u, (A − λ)u′) + ((A − λ)u, BD(λ)(A − λ)u′).

Then (6.3) follows from noting that ((A−λ)u, u′) = (u, (A−λ)u′) because D⊥+Dmin
is a selfadjoint domain and BD(λ)∗ = BD(λ). This proves the ﬁrst assertion of the
lemma.

For the second, we have

(FD(λ)u, u′)A = (BD(λ)(A − λ)u, Au′)A = −(u − BD(λ)(A − λ)u, Au′)A

= −(φu(λ), Au′)A = λ(φu(λ), u′) − (φu(λ), Au′)

1 ⊂ D⊥ be complementary to D⊥

let D⊥

there is ζ < 0 such that πD⊥

(FD(λ) + S)|D⊥

is negative if λ < ζ.

Proof. Suppose that the conclusion is false. Then there is a selfadjoint operator S :
D⊥ → D⊥ and a sequence {ζℓ}∞
(FD(ζℓ)+S)|D⊥
has a nonnegative eigenvalue for each ℓ. Let uℓ ∈ D⊥
1 be an eigenvector of FD(ζℓ)+S
for such an eigenvalue, with kuℓkA = 1. Thus

Since only ﬁnitely many λk can be negative, the estimate implies that

(cid:3)

In particular, if PD⊥ ∩ H −1/2

D† = 0, then for every c > 0 there is ζ < 0 such that

FD(λ) + cI is negative if λ < ζ. Thus:

Corollary 6.7. If PD⊥ ∩ H −1/2
negative λ, and kFD(λ)−1kL (D⊥) → 0 as λ → −∞.

D† = 0, then FD(λ) is invertible for every suﬃciently

The deﬁnition of FD(λ) gives

Kλ = {u − AFD(λ)u : u ∈ D⊥}.

Since FD(λ) is invertible for every suﬃciently negative λ, also

Kλ = {v + FD(λ)−1Av : v ∈ D}.

(6.8)

Thus, if PD⊥ ∩ H −1/2
D† = 0, Corollary 6.7 and (6.8) give that Kλ → D as λ → −∞.
Applied to D = DF and bearing in mind Proposition 4.1 and that the Friedrichs
extension of A is bounded below, we get:

Theorem 6.9. Consider the curve

R− ∋ λ 7→ Kλ ∈ Grd(E).

Then Kλ → DF as λ → −∞.

The limit limλ→−∞ Kλ is of course unique. Since Kλ is independent of its

representation, we have that if in (6.8) Kλ → D then D = DF . Consequently,

Theorem 6.10. The Friedrichs domain of A is the only selfadjoint domain such
that PD⊥ ∩ H −1/2

D† = 0.

Proposition 6.11. Suppose {Dℓ}∞
there is {ζℓ} ⊂ R with ζℓ → −∞ as ℓ → ∞ such that Dℓ ∩ Kζℓ
D ∩ DF 6= 0.

ℓ=1 ⊂ SA is a sequence converging to D and
6= 0. Then

Proof. For each ℓ pick vℓ ∈ Dℓ ∩ Kζℓ with kvℓkA = 1. Passing to a subsequence,
assume that vℓ → v as ℓ → ∞. Using E = DF ⊕ D⊥
F gives for each ℓ, a unique
wℓ ∈ DF such that vℓ = wℓ + FDF (ζℓ)−1Awℓ = vℓ. The continuity of projections
gives that wℓ converges. Now Corollary 6.7 applied to the Friedrichs domain gives
FDF (ζ)−1Awℓ → 0 as ζ → −∞. Thus wℓ → v. Since wℓ ∈ DF , v ∈ DF . Now,
Dℓ = graph Tℓ for a unique Tℓ : D → D⊥; the statement that Dℓ → D means that
Tℓ → 0. Thus wℓ = vℓ + Tℓvℓ for a unique vℓ ∈ D and as before vℓ converges, so wℓ
converges to an element of D which must be v. Since kvkA = 1, D ∩ DF 6= 0. (cid:3)

7. Spectrally unstable domains

The following, a restatement of Theorem 1.4, is our main result.

Theorem 7.1. Let DF = DF + Dmin be the domain of the Friedrichs extension of
A. The element D ∈ SA has the property (1.3) if and only if D ∈ VDF .

We have written VDF = {D ∈ SA : D ∩ DF 6= 0}. This is a real-algebraic

subvariety of SA of codimension 1.

Proof. If D ∈ SA, then either πD⊥
case, D ∈ UD⊥

, and in the second, D ∈ VDF . Thus

F

|D : D → D⊥

F is injective, or not. In the ﬁrst

F

SA = (SA ∩UD⊥

F

) ∪ VDF

as a disjoint union.

Proposition 6.11 gives that every element of SA ∩UD⊥

F

is spectrally stable, so we

only need to show that every element of VDF is spectrally unstable.

Suppose D ∈ VDF . We will show the existence of curves λ 7→ Dλ in SA such
that Dλ → D as λ → −∞ and Dλ ∩ Kλ 6= 0. With such a curve we have that if
U is a neighborhood of D and ζ < 0, then there is ζ ′ < ζ such that Dλ ∈ U for
every λ < ζ ′. Since Kλ ∩ Dλ 6= 0, λ belongs to the spectrum of A with domain
Dλ = Dλ + Dmin, which shows that D is spectrally unstable.

By Corollary 6.7 and Proposition 4.1, the operator FDF (λ) : D⊥

F → D⊥

F is

invertible for every suﬃciently negative λ, so

Kλ = {v + FDF (λ)−1Av : v ∈ DF },

see (6.8). Let V be a subspace of D ∩ DF , V 6= 0. As usual let πD and πD⊥ be the
orthogonal projections on D and D⊥. If v ∈ V , then

v + FDF (λ)−1Av = πD(v + FDF (λ)−1Av) + πD⊥ (v + FDF (λ)−1Av)

= (v + πDFDF (λ)−1Av) + πD⊥ FDF (λ)−1Av.

Let

Vλ = {v + πDFDF (λ)−1Av : v ∈ V },

a subspace of D. Let W be the orthogonal complement of V in D. The mapping
D → D given by

V ⊕ W ∋ (v ⊕ w) 7→ v + πDFDF (λ)−1Av + w ∈ D

is invertible for every suﬃciently negative λ because kFDF (λ)−1k → 0 as λ → −∞.
Its inverse tends to the identity as λ → −∞ and maps Vλ to V . Let Sλ : Vλ → V
be the restriction to Vλ of this inverse and deﬁne Tλ,0 : Vλ → D⊥ by

Tλ,0 = πD⊥ FDF (λ)−1ASλ.

Then

therefore

{v + Tλ,0v : v ∈ Vλ} = {v + FDF (λ)−1Av : v ∈ V } ⊂ Kλ,

(cid:0)v + Tλ,0v, A(v′ + Tλ,0v′)(cid:1)A = 0

(cf. the proof of Lemma 2.10). Let Wλ be the orthogonal complement of Vλ in D.
We now look for Tλ,1 : Wλ → D⊥ such that with Tλ : D → D⊥ deﬁned as Tλ,0 on

for every v, v′ ∈ V

(7.2)

SPECTRALLY UNSTABLE DOMAINS

15

Vλ and as Tλ,1 on Wλ we have that graph Tλ ∈ SA. Because of (2.7) this will be
the case iﬀ for arbitrary v, v′ ∈ Vλ and w, w′ ∈ Wλ the quantity

(cid:0)v + w + Tλ,0v + Tλ,1w, A(v′ + w′ + Tλ,0v′ + Tλ,1w′)(cid:1)A

vanishes. Using (7.2) ﬁrst and then several times that D and D⊥ are both in SA
(so we can take advantage of (2.7)) while keeping in mind that the ranges of Tλ,0
and Tλ,1 lie in D⊥, the above expression is equivalent to

(cid:0)v, ATλ,1w′(cid:1)A +(cid:0)Tλ,0v, Aw′(cid:1)A +(cid:0)w, ATλ,0v′(cid:1)A +(cid:0)Tλ,1w, Av′(cid:1)A

In order for this to vanish for all V, v′, w, w′ it is necessary and suﬃcient that

+(cid:0)w, ATλ,1w′(cid:1)A +(cid:0)Tλ,1w, Aw′(cid:1)A
(cid:0)v, ATλ,1w′(cid:1)A +(cid:0)Tλ,0v, Aw′(cid:1)A = 0 and (cid:0)w, ATλ,1w′(cid:1)A +(cid:0)Tλ,1w, Aw′(cid:1)As = 0

for all v ∈ Vλ and w, w′ ∈ Wλ. Letting T ∗
ﬁrst condition is equivalent to the requirement that ATλ,1 = −T ∗

λ,0 : D → Vλ,0 be the adjoint of Tλ,0, the

λ,0A, that is,

Tλ,1 = AT ∗

λ,0A.

With this deﬁnition of Tλ,1 both (cid:0)w, ATλ,1w′(cid:1)A and (cid:0)Tλ,1w, Aw′(cid:1)A vanish because

Wλ ⊥ Vλ and A is unitary. Thus ATλ : D → D is selfadjoint, and since Tλ → 0 as
λ → −∞,

Dλ = graph Tλ ∈ SA, Kλ ∩ Dλ 6= 0, and Dλ → D as λ → −∞.

We have shown that VDF consists of spectrally unstable domains.

(cid:3)

We end with an alternate argument to Proposition 6.11 that that all elements
F →

of SA ∩UD⊥
DF be such that D0 = graph T0, let S0 = AT0, and let M > kS0k. Then

are spectrally stable. Let D0 ∈ SA ∩UD⊥

be arbitrary, let T0 : D⊥

F

F

U = {graph T : T ∈ L (D⊥

F , DF ), S = AT selfadjoint, kSk < M }

is a neighborhood of D0 in SA. There is ζ < 0 such that
A ∀u ∈ D⊥
F → D⊥

Let D ∈ U , so D = graph T with S = AT : D⊥
Then

(FDF (λ)u, u)A ≤ −M kuk2

F , λ < ζ.
F selfadjoint and kSk < M .

((FDF (λ) − S)u, u)A ≤ (−M + kSk)kuk2

A ∀u ∈ D⊥

F , λ < ζ

hence ker(FDF (λ) − S) = 0 if λ < ζ. Therefore

by (6.1).
