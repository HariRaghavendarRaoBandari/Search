ABSTRACT

We present VLT/X-Shooter and MUSE spectroscopy of an intrinsically faint F814W=28.82 ± 0.33
(MU V = −16.8), low mass ( <∼ 107M(cid:12)) and compact (Ref f = 67pc) freshly star-forming galaxy at
z = 3.1169 magniﬁed (20×) by the Hubble Frontier Fields galaxy cluster Abell S1063. Gravitational
lensing allows for a signiﬁcant jump toward low-luminosity regimes, in moderately high resolution
spectroscopy (R = λ/dλ ∼ 3000 − 7400).
In particular, we measured Civλ1548, 1550, Heiiλ1640,
Oiii]λ1661, 1666, Ciii]λλ1907, 1909, Hβ, [O iii]λλ4959, 5007, emission lines with F W HM <∼ 50kms−1
and (de-lensed) ﬂuxes spanning the interval 1.0 × 10−19 − 2 × 10−18ergs−1cm−2 at S/N=4-30. The
double peaked Lyα emission with ∆v(red−blue) = 280(±7) km s−1 and de-lensed ﬂuxes 2(blue)|7(red)×
10−18ergs−1cm−2 (S/N=38(blue)|110(red)) indicates a low column density of neutral hydrogen gas
(NHI (cid:39) 1016−18.5cm−2), consistent with an highly ionized interstellar medium as also inferred from the
large [Oiii]λ5007/ [Oii]λ3727 > 10 ratio. We detect Civλ1548, 1550 resonant doublet in emission, each
component with F W HM <∼ 45 km s−1, and redshifted by +51(±10) km s−1 relative to the systemic
redshift. We interpret this as nebular emission tracing an expanding optically-thin interstellar medium.
Both Civλ1548, 1550 and Heiiλ1640 suggest the presence of hot and massive stars (with a possible
faint AGN). The ultraviolet slope is remarkably blue, β = −2.95 ± 0.20 (Fλ = λβ), consistent with
a dust-free and young <∼ 20 Myr galaxy. We are witnessing an early episode of star-formation in
which a relatively low NHI and negligible dust attenuation might favor a leakage of ionizing radiation.
This galaxy currently represents a unique low-luminosity reference object for future studies of the
reionization epoch with JWST and ELT.

ing when this occurred, the physical processes involved
and the sources of ionizing radiation represents one of
the major goals in observational cosmology. The pro-
duction of ionizing radiation is most probably driven by
star formation and/or nuclear activity, but their rela-
tive contribution to the ionizing background is still mat-
ter of debate (e.g., Fontanot et al. 2014).
Irrespective
of the nature of ionizing radiation, the general consen-
sus is that the faint sources are the main producers of
the ionizing background at high redshift (Wise et al.
2014; Kimm & Cen 2014; Madau & Haardt 2015, but
see Sharma et al. 2016). This implicitly assumes that
on average ionizing photons are not trapped in faint
sources and escape. It is therefore important to push ob-
servations toward low luminosity regimes (L < 0.1L(cid:63)),
to investigate the nature of ionizing radiation and the
opacity at the Lyman continuum (LyC, < 912˚A). Fur-
thermore, high-ionization and narrow atomic transitions
(like Civλ1548, 1550, Heiiλ1640, Ciii]λλ1907, 1909) re-
cently identiﬁed at z ∼ 2 − 3 and z > 6 raised in-
triguing questions about the presence of hot and mas-
sive stars and/or faint nuclear activity (e.g., Stark et al.
2014, 2015a) and/or possible extreme stellar populations
(Sobral et al. 2015). Also the large [Oiii]λ5007 signature
(with rest-frame equivalent width > 500 − 1000˚A) and
the large [Oiii]λ5007/ [Oii]λ3727 ratio (> 5) recently
observed in relatively bright (L (cid:39) L(cid:63)) LyC emitting

galaxies is opening promising prospects for the charac-
terization of reionizing sources at z > 6 (de Barros et
al. 2016; Vanzella et al. 2016; Nakajima & Ouchi 2014;
Jaskot & Oey 2013; Izotov et al. 2016).
In this pilot
study, we push these observations to unprecedented lu-
minosity limits (L (cid:39) 0.02L(cid:63), or F 814W (cid:39) 28.82) and ask
the questions, what is the nature of the ionizing radiation
at very faint luminosity/mass domain? Are faint sources
optically thin at the LyC as expected if they dominate
reionization? Here a detailed study of a faint galaxy
is presented, taking advantage of multi-wavelength pho-
tometry available from CLASH (Postman et al. 2012)
and Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) projects (Lotz et al.
2014; Koekemoer et al. 2014)15 and from low and medium
resolution spectroscopy we obtained at VLT (VIMOS,
MUSE and X-Shooter).

2. TARGET SELECTION, MAGNIFICATION AND

X-SHOOTER OBSERVATIONS

The source ID11 has been selected among a sam-
ple of Lyα emitters identiﬁed with MUSE behind the
HFF galaxy cluster AS1063 (or RXJ2248, see Karman
et al. (2015), K15 hereafter) and previously detected by
Balestra et al. (2013). Four hours MUSE observations
produced spectra with spectral resolution (cid:39) 1900− 3500
in the range 4800-9300˚A (K15).

ID11 is a z = 3.1169 compact galaxy lensed into three
images, A, B and C as shown in Figure 1. The A and B
images have very similar I814W magnitudes, 25.65±0.02
and 25.57 ± 0.02, respectively, while the third one (C) is
the faintest with I814W= 27.06 ± 0.04 magnitude. The
high S/N detection of the three images is achieved thanks
to the recent deep HST/ACS imaging as part of the HFF
program (Lotz et al. 2014; Koekemoer et al. 2014). Such
a geometric conﬁguration is well reproduced by the lens-
ing modeling. The galaxy is close to a caustic on the
source plane and the corresponding critical line lies ap-
proximately between the two images A and B on the lens
plane. Among the three images, the faintest one (C)
has the least uncertain magniﬁcation factor, that is esti-
mated to be µC = 5.0± 0.2 (Caminha et al. 2016a). The
magniﬁcation of the counter-images A and B have been
calculated from the observed ﬂux ratios between C and
images A,B, since the three images originate from the
same source (Figure 1). The resulting magniﬁcations are
µA = 18.5 and µB = 20.0 with errors smaller than 10%,
inferred from the photometry and the more accurate es-
timate of µC. The de-lensed magnitude of the source in
the F814W band (probing the (cid:39) 2000˚A rest-frame) is
28.82 ± 0.33.

The VLT/X-Shooter (Vernet et al. 2011) observations
of source ID11 have been performed by inserting compo-
nents A and B in the slit (Figure 1). Out of 4 hours re-
quested only 2 have been executed. However, combining
the two counter-images A and B, the equivalent of four
hours of integration have been achieved with a spectral
resolution R of 5000, 7350 and 5100 in the three UVB
((cid:39)3000-5600˚A), VIS ((cid:39)5500-10000˚A) and NIR ((cid:39)10000-
23700˚A) arms, respectively.

Particular care has been devoted to the data reduc-
tion of such a faint object. The data were ﬁrst reduced
using the latest release of the ESO X-Shooter pipeline

15 http://www.stsci.edu/hst/campaigns/frontier-ﬁelds/

(Modigliani et al. 2010). The ESO pipeline produces
rectiﬁed sky-subtracted spectra of the echelle orders that
are useful to determine the position of the two A and B
images along the slit. With this information a model of
the sky emission on the science exposure has been cal-
culated with the technique described in Kelson (2003).16
Wavelength calibration was performed by registering a
ﬁxed two-dimensional solution to reference arc lamp lines
(for the UVB arm) or to the sky emission lines (for
the VIS and NIR arms), the r.m.s. was typically 1/10
pixel. As a further check, the wavelength position of
the emission lines are fully consistent with what derived
from MUSE. The combined 1D spectrum was optimally
extracted from the wavelength- and ﬂux-calibrated 2D
spectra. A resolution-optimized velocity binning was
adopted for the three arms (20, 11, and 19 km s−1 for
the UVB, VIS, and NIR, respectively).

The reduced spectrum and the zoomed Lyα line are

shown in Figure 2 and 3, respectively.

3. RESULTS FROM SPECTROSCOPY AND MULTI-BAND

PHOTOMETRY

3.1. Spectral properties

The double peaked Lyα line was initially detected with
MUSE (K15). The two components of the doublet are
resolved at the X-Shooter resolution, in which the asym-
metric shape with a trough toward the systemic velocity
is evident (see Figure 3).

As already discussed in K15,

faint high ionization
emission lines have been detected (Civλ1548, 1550,
Heiiλ1640, Oiii]λ1661, 1666) but not resolved at the
MUSE spectral resolution, placing a limit of F W HM <
100 km s−1(instrumental corrected). As the Lyα line is
the brightest feature in the MUSE data, we used it to
create a mask to extract the spectra. Although this lead
to the highest S/N and ﬂux measurement of Lyα, the
high-ionization lines do not have enough S/N in the outer
parts of this mask, and are consequently reduced to lower
S/N. We therefore used the mask to extract the Lyα ﬂux,
but used a circular 1(cid:48)(cid:48) radius aperture to measure the
high-ionization lines, and veriﬁed that these ﬂuxes are in
agreement with the ﬂuxes in the full Lya-mask.
While MUSE reaches deeper ﬂux limits with a res-
olution element > 100 km s−1, the X-Shooter spectral
resolution allows us to investigate the width of the fea-
tures down to few tens km s−1 and better resolve emis-
sion lines close to the sky emission. We anchor the
ﬂux measurements in the VIS arm to the MUSE ones
(e.g. Civλ1548, 1550 doublet), therefore accounting for
slit losses and derive X-Shooter ﬂuxes for other lines oth-
erwise missed in MUSE due to sky perturbation. In par-
ticular, all the high-ionization lines identiﬁed in the X-
Shooter spectrum show a FWHM of <∼ 50 km s−1 (see
Table 1).
It is worth noting that an accurate identiﬁ-
cation of such narrow lines in high redshift star forming
galaxies is often compromised in low resolution spectra
(e.g., R < 1000, an example is shown in panel A.1 of Fig-
ure 2, blue line). The equivalent widths of the lines have
been estimated from the line ﬂuxes and the underlying
continuum derived from SED ﬁts (see below).

Furthermore, the near infrared coverage of X-Shooter

and ultraviolet Oiii]λ1661, 1666 and Ciii]λ1908 lines we
derived zsyst = 3.1169 ± 0.0002. Diﬀerently, both
Civλ1548, 1550 components show a clear velocity shift
of +51(±10) km s−1(Figure 3). Moreover, the observed
[Oiii]5007/[Oii]3727 ratio (O32 index) is large (> 10).
We discuss below the possible interpretation of such fea-
tures.
It is worth noting that at the given spectral resolution
R = 5000 − 7000 and S/N of line ﬂuxes, the X-Shooter
spectrum presented here resembles what a 40-meter class
telescope can achieve in few hours integration time for
an unlensed object of the same absolute magnitude and

redshift (Evans et al. 2015).

3.2. Modeling the Lyα proﬁle

The separation of the double peaked Lyα line ∆peaks =
280(±7) km s−1 is smaller than commonly found at this
redshift. Kulas et al. (2012) reported typical separations
from 400 up to 1000 kms−1 for brighter L∗ galaxies. It
is instead slightly lower than the case reported by Chris-
tensen et al. (2012) in a lensed galaxy at z = 1.83, in
which narrow Civλ1548, 1550 emission was also detected.
The observed small separation suggests the NHI is low.
Speciﬁcally, we modeled the Lyα structure with the ex-
panding shell model presented in Gronke et al. (2015) and
described in Karman et al. (in prep). We refer the reader
to those works for details. A relatively narrow range of
NHI is allowed, NHI (cid:39) 1016−18.5cm−2 (an example is

detail of the X-Shooter Civλ1548, 1550 doublet is shown in A.3, red line, superimposed to MUSE and VIMOS spectra. The individual
lines of the doublet are still unresolved (at R = 7350), implying an instrumental-corrected FWHM<45 km s−1. Bottom part: Two

frames. The circles indicate lines after summing the two sky-subtracted images A and B (4hr) and shifting the spectra properly along the
spatial direction. The emissions above and below the circles are the single exposures (2hr).

velocity (zsyst = 3.1169). The measured velocity shift
is consistent with the velocity expansion inferred from
the Lyα modeling reported above and can be ascribed to
thin nebular emission from a moving medium.

Optical rest-frame oxygen emission lines also trace
the status of the ISM. In particular, a large O32
([Oiii]5007/[Oii]3727> 10) index has been recently found
in a LyC emitter at z = 3.212 (de Barros et al. 2016),
for which escaping ionizing radiation has been conﬁrmed
with HST observations (Vanzella et al. 2016). The source
described in this work shows a large O32 index (> 10),
plausibly linked to a low NHI , similarly to what is in-
ferred from the Lyα and Civλ1548, 1550 features dis-
cussed above. Such a large O32 index would suggest
a density-bounded ISM, highly photo-ionized, in which
the [Oii]λ3727 emission is deﬁcient (e.g., Jaskot & Oey
2013; Nakajima & Ouchi 2014).

3.4. A newborn and compact galaxy

Fig. 4.— SED ﬁts with Bruzual & Charlot templates are shown.
The ﬁts have been performed by both including and excluding the
bands signiﬁcantly contaminated by the IGM and emission lines
(red points). The resulting physical quantities are reported with
their 68% uncertainty. The intrinsic (de-lensed) stellar mass and
star formation rate are reported. Observed and de-lensed magni-
tudes are reported in the Y-axis on the left and right side, respec-
tively.

it is worth noting that a leakage of ionizing radiation
is also possible (i.e., τLyC < 1 if NHI < 1017.2cm−2).
An outﬂow velocity of (cid:39) 55(±10) km s−1 is also derived
from the same modeling, fully consistent with the veloc-
ity oﬀset inferred from the Civλ1548, 1550 line doublet
(see below).
It is worth mentioning that fast outﬂows
(> 100 km s−1) can mimic low NHI when inferred from
the Lyα proﬁle (Verhamme et al. 2015; Schaerer et al.
2011). However, the low velocity expansion derived from
the Civλ1548, 1550 doublets support a low NHI for this
galaxy (< 1018.5cm−2).

3.3. The C ivλ1548, 1550 doublet and optical oxygen

lines

Another evidence supporting a transparent medium is
the presence of nebular Civλ1548, 1550 emission. The
Civλ1548, 1550 doublet is a resonant transition and
very rarely observed with such narrow components in
emission, possibly due to the low spectral resolution
and limited depth of the current spectroscopic sur-
veys. High redshift star forming galaxies typically show
Civλ1548, 1550 absorption features produced by the in-
terstellar medium. However, such a transition is a combi-
nation of stellar P-Cygni emission and broad absorption
(e.g., Kudritzki 2002), possible nebular emission, and in-
terstellar absorption superposed (Shapley et al. 2003).
In our case the very thin lines (σv ≤ 20 km s−1) sug-
gest that the interstellar medium is transparent, allowing
the Civλ1548, 1550 nebular emission to emerge. This re-
calls the low NHI inferred from Lyα modeling mentioned
above. Furthermore, the doublet is also redshifted by
(cid:39) 51± 10 km s−1 (z = 3.1176) compared to the systemic

Multi-band imaging from the CLASH survey (Postman
et al. 2012), recent deep HST/ACS observations part of
the HFF program (F435W, F606W and F814W) and ad-
ditional archival HST data have been collected and com-
bined to produce the photometric SED shown in Fig-
ure 4 (photometry has been extracted following Coe et al.
2015). We also retrieved and reduced the VLT/HAWKI
Ks-band images from the ESO archive (P095.A-0533, P.I.
Brammer) and added it to the SED (see Karman et al.
2016). The physical properties have been derived by per-
forming SED ﬁtting with Bruzual & Charlot (2003) mod-
els both on A and B images, and accounting for nebu-
lar emission by ﬁxing the emission line ratios to the ob-
served ones (Schaerer & de Barros 2009, 2010). The ﬁts
have been carried out by including/excluding the bands
aﬀected by IGM and strong emission lines (Lyα and
[O iii]λλ4959, 5007). The inferred physical quantities
agree well in both cases and for the two counter-images
(Figure 4). The K-band magnitudes are well recovered
even when the same band is excluded from the ﬁt, in
particular the [O iii]λλ4959, 5007 lines dominate the K-
band emission (Table 1). Remarkably, an extremely blue
ultraviolet slope is derived for the two images, from col-
ors directly (e.g., Castellano et al. 2012) and from the
best-ﬁt SED, β = −2.95 ± 0.12 and β = −2.7 ± 0.1,
respectively (see Figure 4). Such a blue shape is quite
extreme and is compatible with a dust-free and newborn
galaxy with an emergent stellar component of <∼ 20Myr.
The stellar mass turns out to be M(cid:63)

<∼ 107M(cid:12).

The ultraviolet emission arises from a spatially resolved
region. From the F814W image of C (S/N> 20), which
has better constrained magniﬁcation (µC = 5.0 ± 0.2),
the (de-lensed) isophotal area obtained with SExtractor
is 0.4kpc2 and the half light radius Ref f = 67(±15)pc.
The Ref f and the uncertainty have been derived with
Galﬁt (Peng et al. 2010) following the method described
in Vanzella et al. (2015, 2016). Figure 1 shows three
examples of observed–model residuals for three Ref f in
the F814W band: 30, 67 and 100 parsecs, corresponding
to 0.30 (unresolved), 0.65 and 1.00 pixel, 1pixel=0.03(cid:48)(cid:48)).
A similar solution is obtained from the F606W (C),
Ref f (cid:39) 60pc. Such a small size, coupled with the afore-
mentioned properties is reminescent of that observed in
a z ∼ 3.212 LyC emitter (Vanzella et al. 2016), though in
the present case the source is more than three magnitude

The

line
like
comparison
Civλ1550/Ciii]λ1908,
Civλ1550/Heiiλ1640,
Oiii]λ1666/Heiiλ1640,
with
models of Feltre et al. (2016) places the source among
the star-forming galaxies, though still close to the AGN
cloud, similarly to the blue galaxies of Stark et al.
(2014). Such models are not conclusive for our object,
however they do not consider a possible leakage of
ionizing radiation, that could alter the expected ratios
both for the UV and optical rest-frame lines, as for
example happens for the O32 index (Nakajima & Ouchi
2014). While the high ionization lines are compatible
with an AGN, other properties suggest that the stellar
emission is dominating: the source is spatially resolved
in all the HST/ACS images, the very narrow widths
of the involved emission lines (F W HM < 50 km s−1,
σv < 20 km s−1) and the extremely blue slope are not
typically observed in AGN-powered objects. Also the
redshifted Civλ1548, 1550 doublet seems to contrast
the ubiquitous blueshift observed in AGNs, though
at brighter luminosities (e.g., Richards et al. 2011).
Therefore it is not clear if there is a faint AGN in this
system or if the high ionization emission lines (like
Civλ1548, 1550 and Heiiλ1640) are tracing hot and
massive stars (T > 50000K, Raiter et al. 2010; Gr¨afener
& Vink 2015).

4.2. A young and naked galaxy: a candidate

low-luminosity LyC emitter

The observed spectroscopic and photometric proper-
ties in such intrinsically faint (mag = 28.82) galaxy can
be measured only as a result of the factor (cid:39) 20 mag-
niﬁcation. The object is a compact (Ref f = 67pc),
young ( <∼ 20Myr), low mass ( <∼ 107M(cid:12)) and dust-free
galaxy, with an ionizing source able to generate a density-
bounded condition in the interstellar medium as inferred
from the large O32 index. Such a transparent medium
would therefore enable the young stellar component to
dominate the emission and produce the steep ultraviolet
slope. The redshifted Civλ1548, 1550 nebular emission
would be also in line with an expanding optically-thin
medium.
In addition, the very narrow double peaked

Lyα proﬁle (∆v = 280 km s−1), the proximity of the red
Lyα peak to the systemic redshift ((cid:39) 100 km s−1) and the
low velocity outﬂow suggest a low NHI (1016−18.5cm−2).
Finally, as discussed by Raiter et al. (2010), the case of an
escaping ionizing radiation would generate a depression
of the nebular continuum that further favors a steepening
of the ultraviolet slope, enhancing the equivalent width
of the faint lines like Heiiλ1640 or Ciii]λ1908, otherwise
washed-out by the continuum.

The thinness of the medium is noteworthy in this ob-
ject and opens the possibility that it is a LyC emitter.
Irrespective of possible LyC leakage, the analysis address
for the ﬁrst time a still unexplored luminosity and mass
domain, and provide a unique reference lower redshift
analog to the higher redshift sources (z > 6) at similar
luminosities, believed to be the main actors during reion-
ization (Castellano et al. 2016; Bouwens et al. 2015; Atek
et al. 2015). It will be crucial to extend the analysis to
a statistically signiﬁcant sample and fainter luminosity
limits.
Even though these extremely blue galaxies could be
rare at z ∼ 3, it might not be the case at z > 6, as the
β-luminosity relations of Bouwens et al. (2014) seems
In particular, at z ∼ 7 an average β (cid:39)
to indicate.
−2.8 is expected at the luminosity probed here (MU V =
−16.8, see also Finkelstein et al. 2012). For example, the
comparison among the object presented here and and the
Civλ1548, 1550 emitter discovered at z = 7.04 (Stark et
al. 2015b) could be very useful in this respect.
Interestingly, within a region of ∼ 100kpc (proper)
from the source discussed here, four additional sources
and a multiply lensed Lyα blob have been discovered
(Caminha et al. 2016b).

Finally, we remark that the initial phases of star-
formation as observed here oﬀer the opportunity to test
models of galaxy formation and photoionization eﬀects
in low-mass objects for the ﬁrst time.
