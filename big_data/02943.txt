Abstract

We use a top-down holographic model for strongly interacting quark matter to study the properties of

neutron stars. When the corresponding Equation of State (EoS) is matched with state-of-the-art results for

dense nuclear matter, we consistently observe a ﬁrst order phase transition at densities between two and

seven times the nuclear saturation density. Solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations with the

resulting hybrid EoSs, we ﬁnd maximal stellar masses in the excess of two solar masses, albeit somewhat

smaller than those obtained with simple extrapolations of the nuclear matter EoSs.

1 Introduction

Quantitatively predicting the bulk thermodynamic

properties of dense nuclear and quark matter is one of

the major challenges of modern nuclear theory. The

complexity of the task originates from the need to

nonperturbatively solve the theory of strong interac-

tions, QCD, at ﬁnite baryon chemical potentials µB.
This combination of requirements is problematic, as

all the ﬁrst principles tools the theory is typically at-

tacked with fail: Lattice simulations suﬀer from the

infamous sign problem at ﬁnite baryon chemical po-

tentials [1], while perturbative QCD is invalidated by

the sizable value of the gauge coupling at moderate

densities [2]. At present, the Equation of State (EoS)

of cold strongly interacting matter is under quanti-

tative control at baryon densities below the nuclear

Clearly, there is a need for fundamentally new ap-

created in heavy ion collisions [13]. In this context,

energy can then be computed by evaluating the clas-

sical on-shell action of SUGRA together with the D-

brane action. Given the relative simplicity of the cal-

culations involved, the duality thus bestows us with a

powerful tool to explore strongly coupled quark mat-

The paper is organized as follows: our construction
is thoroughly explained in §2, while the resulting EoS
and its relation to that of nuclear matter is analyzed
in §3. The implications of the hybrid EoS for the
properties of neutron star are then displayed in §4,
while conclusions are drawn and an outlook presented

contributions of adjoint and ﬂavor ﬁelds

F = FN =4 + Fﬂavor,

(2.1)

where the ﬁrst term is independent of the charge den-

sity and does not play a very important role for us.

In the following, we work in the grand canonical

ensemble, so that the free energy is a function of the

temperature T as well as chemical potentials corre-

sponding to the conserved charges. Barring the pres-

ence of a mixture of two phases, possible in a ﬁrst

ﬁeld theory is then N = 2 Super Yang-Mills (SYM)
with the matter content of N = 4 SU (Nc) SYM in
the adjoint sector and Nf matter hypermultiplets in
the fundamental representation. This means that

inside neutron stars is typically taken to be locally

charge neutral and in beta equilibrium. This can be

realized by taking the chemical potentials and den-

sities of the u, d, and s quarks to agree [41], which

implies neglecting the diﬀerences in their bare masses

of which we identify as the baryon symmetry. For

thus four parameters: The number of colors Nc, the
number of ﬂavors Nf , the ’t Hooft coupling λY M ,
and the mass m. We choose them according to the

properties of deconﬁned QCD matter at the relevant

densities, which implies setting Nc = Nf = 3. In this
case, the contribution of the adjoint sector to the free
energy FN =4 ∼ N 2
c T 4 becomes the same order as the
O(T 4) corrections to the ﬂavor free energy, and can
thereby be neglected.

It should be noted that upon choosing the above

values for Nc and Nf , we are extrapolating our model
to a regime where ﬁnite Nc and Nf /Nc corrections are
expected to become important [46–50]. For practical

reasons, we however choose to neglect them in the

following, which implies that we treat the model as

phenomenologically motivated by the original string

theory construction. In this spirit, we also allow the

’t Hooft coupling and the mass to take values appro-

priate for the physical system under consideration,

expecting them to lie in a region where the holo-

graphic approach remains at least qualitatively valid

(for a recent discussion of the convergence of strong

coupling expansions, see [51]).

With the above reservations, we proceed to note

that in the limit of large chemical potentials, the free

energy density of our model approaches the value

value of the ’t Hooft coupling as

λY M =

3π2

γ3 (cid:39) 10.74.

(2.5)

With this choice, our model can be seen to match the

perturbative EoS of [7] already at moderate densities

(cf. the next section).

Finally, we discuss the choice of the mass parame-

ter m. We expect that in the strongly coupled region

the eﬀective masses of the quarks receive large non-

perturbative corrections, so relating this last remain-

ing parameter of our model to the (diﬀering) bare

masses of the u, d, and s quarks would be largely

nonsensical. Rather, we have chosen to ﬁx m through

the value of the quark chemical potential, where the

pressure of our model vanishes, requiring it to agree

with the value obtained from the EoS of low-density

nuclear matter [52]. This produces
m ≈ 308.55 MeV,

(2.6)

which is just below one third of the nucleon mass.

As argued above, at large densities and vanishing

temperature, the pressure p and the energy density

ε of our model can be determined from Eq. (2.2) as
p = −Fﬂavor, ε = µq
− p. The EoS thus takes the

3 Matching to nuclear matter

Having obtained a candidate EoS for strongly cou-

pled dense quark matter, the natural question arises,

how to best use it in applications within neutron star

physics. At low densities, we expect the matter to

reside in the conﬁned phase and, as the density is

sure with that of deconﬁned quark matter obtained

from our setup, thereby determining the dominant

phase at each quark chemical potential. Due to the

uncertainty related to the extrapolation of the low-

density result, the matching should not be done using

a single conﬁning EoS. To this end, we use the three

EoSs of Table 5 of [11], dubbed ‘soft’, ‘intermediate’,

and ‘stiﬀ’, to represent the diﬀerent possible behav-

iors of the nuclear matter EoS. Of the three, the soft

and stiﬀ EoSs are taken to represent extreme cases,

the D3-D7 model, because at nonzero baryon den-

sure vs. quark chemical potential. As can be seen

from the ﬁgure, there is a critical chemical poten-

tial µcrit for each of the three low-density EoSs, at
which a phase transition to deconﬁned quark matter

occurs. In all three cases, the transition is of ﬁrst or-

der, which can be veriﬁed from the right ﬁgure that

displays the hybrid EoSs on a logarithmic pressure

vs. energy density plane. Shown here are also the

CET result of [3, 4] (blue curve), the conformal limit

(brown curve), as well as the perturbative result of [7]

(light blue band, generated by varying the renormal-

ization scale). It is worth pointing out that the holo-

graphic quark matter EoS smoothly connects to the

perturbative one at high density.

It is interesting to note that the densities, at which

the ﬁrst order phase transitions occur, are consis-

tently in a phenomenologically viable region: For the

soft nuclear matter EoS we get ncrit = 6.92 ns, for the
intermediate one ncrit = 3.79 ns, and for the stiﬀ case
ncrit = 2.37 ns. This strengthens our conclusion that
the holographic description is consistent with the ex-

pected properties of strongly coupled quark matter

at least on a qualitative level.

4 Neutron star structure

where M = M (r) denotes the mass of the star re-

siding inside the radius r and GN is the Newton’s
constant. This relation governs hydrostatic equilib-

rium within the stars, and takes as input the relation

between the energy density ε and pressure P of the

matter, i.e. its EoS. The solution to the equations

gives in turn the radial proﬁles ε(r), P (r), and M (r),

while the the total radius of the star R is deﬁned as

the point, where the pressure vanishes, P (R) = 0,

and the mass of the star as the corresponding M (R).

A subtlety related to systems where a ﬁrst order

phase transition occurs is the possible existence of

mixed phases. This, however, strongly depends on

the value of the microscopic surface tension between

the nuclear and quark matter phases. As this param-

eter is beyond the validity of our description, and only

ballpark estimates for it exist even in QCD, we have

chosen to neglect this scenario and only consider stars

made out of pure phases.

Plugging the three EoSs of Fig. 1 into the TOV

equations, we straightforwardly obtain the three

Mass-Radius curves displayed in Fig. 2. They fol-

low the corresponding three curves of Ref. [11] until

they abruptly come to an end at a point that marks

the density of our ﬁrst order phase transition. At this

point, the solutions to the TOV equation take a sharp

turn towards smaller masses and radii, signaling an

conditions, it is possible to ﬁnd a simple analytical

expression for the EoS, but in order to obtain a phe-

nomenologically viable model, we need to extrapolate

the result to a regime where sizable corrections are to

be expected. An important caveat in this extrapola-

tion is that the phase diagram of the theory may be

altered by it; for instance, it was argued in [61] that at

low temperatures squarks will condense and the sys-

tem will be in a Higgsed phase. No other instabilities

have been found [50], but the appearance of spatially

modulated phases as ﬁrst discussed in [62–65] is not

ruled out.

There exist a number of directions,

in which

our current work can (and should) be generalized.

Within the present model, the most obvious exten-

sion would be to allow for the presence of a mixed

phase of nuclear and quark matter, assuming a given

value for the surface tension between the two phases

[66].

In addition to this, one may consider correc-

tions due to the diﬀerent bare masses of the quark ﬂa-

vors, as well as to nonzero temperature or background

magnetic ﬁelds. With moderate eﬀort, one may also

consider the eﬀects of ﬁnite Nc and λY M corrections
on the EoS, utilizing existing results at the Next-

to-Leading Order level. Finally, the real strength of

holography lies of course in its applicability to the

determination of quantities that are much more chal-

lenging for traditional ﬁeld theory techniques. These

include e.g. transport constants and emission rates,

which could both be considered within our present

model.
