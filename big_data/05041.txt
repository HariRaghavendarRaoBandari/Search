Abstract

We show how to get Krall polynomials from Krall discrete polynomials using a
procedure of passing to the limit in some of the parameters of the family. We
also show that this procedure has to be diﬀerent to the standard one used in
the Askey scheme to go from the classical discrete polynomials to the classical
polynomials.

Keywords: Krall polynomials, classical polynomials, classical discrete
polynomials, Askey scheme.

1. Introduction

The hypergeometric representation of classical and classical discrete orthog-
onal polynomials gives rise to the socalled Askey scheme or Askey tableau (see
[28], Ch. 9). Askey scheme is an organized hierarchy of hypergeometric or-
thogonal polynomials, namely, Hermite, Laguerre, Jacobi (the classical fam-
ilies), Charlier, Meixner, Krawtchouk, Hahn (the classical discrete families),
dual Hahn, Racah, Wilson, etc. One can navigate through the Askey scheme by
passing to the limits in the parameters. For instance, one can get the Laguerre
polynomials (Lα
n )n (normalized so that
the leading coeﬃcient of ma,c
n is 1/n!) by setting x → x/(1 − a) and c = α + 1
and taking limit as a → 1; more precisely

n)n, from the Meixner polynomials (ma,c

see [28], p. 243 (take into account that we are using for the Meixner polynomials
a diﬀerent normalization to that in [28]).

Krall or bispectral polynomials are one of the most interesting generalization
of classical and classical discrete polynomials. Krall polynomials are orthogonal
polynomials with respect to a positive measure which in addition are eigenfunc-
tions of a diﬀerential operator of order k bigger than 2. Krall discrete polyno-
mials appear by changing in that deﬁnition diﬀerential operator to diﬀerence
operator.

Krall polynomials were introduced by H.L. Krall.

In the late thirties, he
proved that orthogonal polynomials only can be eigenfunctions of a diﬀerential
operator of even order. He also classiﬁed all families of orthogonal polynomi-
als which in addition are eigenfunctions of a fourth order diﬀerential operator
(see [31, 32]). Besides the classical families, he found three other families of

polynomials orthogonal with respect to the positive measures e−x + uδ0, x ≥ 0,
(1 − x)α + uδ1, −1 < x < 1, and 1 + uδ−1 + uδ1, −1 ≤ x ≤ 1, respectively.

Since the eighties, a big amount of eﬀort has been devoted to this issue (with
contributions by L.L. Littlejohn [36, 37, 38], A. M. Krall [30], J. Koekoek and
R. Koekoek [25, 27, 26], F.A. Gr¨unbaum and L. Haine et al.
[20, 21, 22], A.
Zhedanov [43], K.H. Kwon et al. [33, 34], P. Iliev [23, 24], and the list is by no
means exhaustive).

If we consider positive measures, the recipe for constructing Krall polyno-
mials is to take the Laguerre and Jacobi weights, assume that one or two of
the parameters are nonnegative integers and add a Dirac delta at one or two
of the end points of the interval of orthogonality. For the Laguerre case, the
precise result is the following (see [25]; also [24],[7]). For κ a positive integer,
the orthogonal polynomials (Lκ;u

n )n with respect to the positive measure

xκ−1e−x + κ!uδ0,

(1.2)

are eigenfunctions of a diﬀerential operator of order 2κ + 2. Orthogonal polyno-
mials (Lκ;u
n )n with respect to (1.2) can be expanded in terms of two consecutive
Laguerre polynomials as follows (see Lemma A.3 in [7]; also [24]. For other
representations see [29])

Lκ;u

n (x) = Lκ

n(x) −

(κ − 1)! + u(n + 1)κ

(κ − 1)! + u(n)κ

n−1(x).

(1.3)

The story of Krall discrete polynomials is somehow diﬀerent. In fact, except
for the discrete classical families themselves, no examples satisfying diﬀerence
equations of ﬁnite order bigger than two were known until very recently. What
we knew for the continuous case (or for the q case) had seemed to be of little help
because adding Dirac deltas to the discrete classical families seems not to work.
Indeed, answering a question posed by R. Askey in 1991 (see page 418 of [4]),
H. Bavinck, H. van Haeringen and R. Koekoek studied orthogonal polynomials
with respect to Charlier and Meixner measures together with a Dirac delta at
0 and found that they satisfy certain type of diﬀerence equations of inﬁnite
order ([1, 2]). In 2012, this author introduced the ﬁrst examples of orthogonal
polynomials (pn)n which are common eigenfunctions of a diﬀerence operator
of order bigger than 2 and posed a number of conjectures about them ([6]).
The orthogonalizing measures for these families of polynomials are constructed
by multiplying the classical discrete weights by carefully chosen polynomials.
This kind of transformation which consists in multiplying a measure µ by a
polynomial q is called a Christoﬀel transform. It has a long tradition in the
context of orthogonal polynomials: it goes back a century and a half ago when
E.B. Christoﬀel (see [5] and also [42]) studied it for the particular case q(x) = x.
The conjectures posed in [6] have already been proved in a number of papers
([7, 12, 13], see also [9]). Here it is an example constructed from the Meixner
measure.

If the parameters do not satisfy the assumptions

implicitly assume that m1/a,2−c
(−n) 6= 0, n ∈ N, so that the polynomials (1.5)
are well-deﬁned.

The purpose of this paper is to show that one can get the Krall polynomials
from the Krall discrete polynomials, but taking limits in a diﬀerent way to the
procedure used in the Askey scheme. There one takes limit in only one param-
eter of the classical discrete family while the other parameters are ﬁxed and
independent of the parameter in which one takes limit. For Krall polynomials,
one has to carefully choose suitable functions and equal all those parameters
to such functions in the parameter in which one takes limit. As an example,
here it is a way to get the Krall Laguerre polynomials (Lκ;u
n )n (1.3) from the
Krall Meixner polynomials (ma,c;κ
)n (1.5): in this case we choose the function
φ(x) = κ + 1 + (1 − x)κ/u and write c = φ(a). More precisely

(1.7)

The limits from Krall Meixner to Krall Laguerre polynomials will be considered
in Section 2, while in Section 3, we study the limits from Krall Hahn to Krall
Jacobi polynomials.

We ﬁnish this introduction with a comment on exceptional polynomials.
Exceptional orthogonal polynomials pn, n ∈ X   N, are complete orthogo-
nal polynomial systems with respect to a positive measure which in addition

4

are eigenfunctions of a second order diﬀerential operator. Exceptional discrete
polynomials appear by changing in that deﬁnition diﬀerential operator to dif-
ference operator. Exceptional and exceptional discrete polynomials extend the
classical families of Hermite, Laguerre and Jacobi, and the classical discrete fam-
ilies of Charlier, Meixner, Krawtchouk and Hahn, respectively. In mathematical
physics, exceptional polynomials allow to write exact solutions to rational ex-
tensions of classical quantum potentials. The last few years have seen a great
deal of activity in the area of exceptional orthogonal polynomials, mainly by
theoretical physicists (see, for instance, [8, 10, 11, 16, 17] (where the adjective
exceptional for this topic was introduced), [18, 19, 39, 40, 41], and the references
therein).

The most apparent diﬀerence between classical polynomials and exceptional
polynomials is that the exceptional families have gaps in their degrees, in the
sense that not all degrees are present in the sequence of polynomials (as it
happens with the classical families). This means in particular that they are not
covered by the hypotheses of Bochner’s and Lancaster’s classiﬁcation theorems
for classical and classical discrete polynomials, respectively ([3],[35]).

Up to now no relationship has been found between Krall and exceptional
polynomials (what it is understandable because they are coming from very dif-
ferent problems). However, the situation is completely diﬀerent at the discrete
level, where an unexpected connection between Krall discrete and exceptional
discrete polynomials has been found ([8, 10, 11]). The key for this connection
is a well-known and fruitful concept regarding discrete orthogonal polynomials:
duality (between the variable x and the index n of the polynomial). It has been
shown that duality interchanges exceptional discrete polynomials with Krall
discrete polynomials. What it is relevant for this paper is that one can con-
struct exceptional polynomials from exceptional discrete polynomials by taking
limits in some of the parameters in the same way as one goes from classical
discrete polynomials to classical polynomials in the Askey tableau. However, as
we show here, despite exceptional discrete and Krall discrete polynomials are
dual, this procedure does not work when dealing with Krall and Krall discrete
polynomials, and it has to be changed as explained in this paper.

2. From Krall Meixner to Krall Laguerre polynomials

In this Section we study how to get the Krall Laguerre polynomials (Lκ;u

n )n
orthogonal with respect to the positive measure (1.2) from the Krall Meixner
polynomials (ma,c;κ
)n orthogonal with respect to the positive discrete measure
(1.4).

eralize the limit (1.1) as follows: if φ is a function of a with lima→1 φ(a) = α + 1

We ﬁrst prove the limits (1.6). The ﬁrst one is an easy consequence of (1.5),
(1.1), (2.7) and (2.6). The second one is straightforward from (1.5), (1.1), (2.8)
and (1.3).

We next prove the limit (1.7). For the beneﬁt of the reader we consider

ﬁrst the case κ = 1. The numerator in the coeﬃcient of ma,c

We see then that if we write c = φ(a) with φ(1) = 2, we have

lim

c − 2

= φ′(1),

and φ′(1) can be used as a free parameter. Hence, by setting c = 2 + (1 − a)/u,
we straightforwardly get using (1.5), (2.9) and (1.3):

In order to manage the case for an arbitrary positive integer κ, we need the

Proof. It follows from (2.2) after a careful computation.

The limit (1.7) follows now easily using the previous Lemma, (1.5), (2.9)

and (1.3).

For κ a positive integer and a and c real numbers with 0 < a < 1 and

(c > κ + 1,

polynomials.

We include here basic deﬁnitions and facts about dual Hahn, Hahn and

For a real number u and a positive integer j, we consider the polynomials

calculations.

by adding a Dirac delta at one or two of the end points of the interval of
orthogonality and assuming that the corresponding parameters are nonnegative
integers. We consider each case separately.

3.1. Adding a Dirac delta at −1

We start adding a Dirac delta at −1. For κ a positive integer, and α, u ∈ R
)n with respect to the

with α > −1, u > 0, the orthogonal polynomials (P α,κ;u
positive measure

n

(1 − x)α(1 + x)κ−1 + κ!uδ−1,

(3.18)

are eigenfunctions of a diﬀerential operator of order 2κ + 2 (see [43, 7]). Orthog-
onal polynomials (P α,κ;u
)n with respect to (3.18) can be expanded in terms of
two consecutive Jacobi polynomials as follows (see Lemma A.9 in [7]; also [23])

In order to get Krall Hahn polynomials, we have to apply a suitable Christof-
fel transform to the Hahn measure. Among the several possibilities described
in [6] (see also [13]), we consider here the following one. For κ and N positive
integers and a and b real numbers with −1 < a and κ < b, the orthogonal
polynomials ha,b,N ;κ

consecutive Hahn polynomials as follows (see Theorem 7.5 in [7])

As happens with Krall Meixner and Krall Laguerre polynomials, we cannot
get Krall Jacobi polynomials (3.19) from Krall Hahn polynomials (3.22) taking
limit as in the Askey scheme for getting Jacobi from Hahn polynomials (see
(3.16)).

Proof. Indeed, the ﬁrst limit in (3.23) can be easily deduced using (3.22), (3.16),
(3.5) and (3.12).

On the other hand, the second limit in (3.23) is an easy consequence of

(3.22), (3.16), (3.6), (3.4) and (3.19).

However, one can get Krall Jacobi polynomials (3.19) from Krall Hahn poly-
nomials (3.22) if in (3.23) we force b to be a suitable function of N . More
precisely, we have

The case of adding a Dirac delta at 1 can be worked on taking into account

3.2. Adding Dirac deltas at −1 and 1

We now add Dirac deltas at −1 and 1 to a Jacobi weight and assume that α
and β are positive integers. For κ, σ positive integers, and u, v ∈ R with u, v > 0,

As happens with the other cases considered in this paper, we cannot get Krall
Jacobi polynomials (3.25) from Krall Hahn polynomials (3.28) taking limit as
in the Askey scheme for getting Jacobi from Hahn polynomials (see (3.16)).

If the parameters do not satisfy the assumptions κ < a and σ < b, the

last three cases); we then implicitly assume that the polynomials (3.28) have
degree n.

(3.16), (3.5) and (3.14).

The second and third limits can be deduced from (3.28), (3.16), (3.5), (3.6),

(3.4) and (3.20).

Finally, the last limit is an easy consequence of (3.28), (3.16), (3.6), (3.4)

However, one can get Krall Jacobi polynomials (3.25) from Krall Hahn poly-
nomials (3.28) if we force a and b to be suitable functions of N . More precisely,
we have.
