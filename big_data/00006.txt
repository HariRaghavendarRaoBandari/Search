PARTITIONING HADAMARD VECTORS INTO

HADAMARD MATRICES

PETER G. CASAZZA AND JANET C. TREMAIN

Abstract. We will show that in a space of dimension m, any family of
2m−1 distinct Hadamard vectors (where you can choose x or -x but not
both) can be partitioned into Hadamard matrices if and only if m = 2n
for some n. We will solve this problem with a simple algorithm for
assigning the vectors to the Hadamard matrices.

Recall that

1. Introduction

Deﬁnition 1.1. In Rn, a vector of the form x = (±1, ±1, . . . , ±1) is called
a Hadamard vector. An orthogonal matrix made up of Hadamard vectors
is called a Hadamard matrix.

Note that there are 2n Hadamard vectors but they come as pairs x, −x
and so their are, up to sign, 2n−1 distinct Hadamard vectors. The
Hadamard Conjecture states:

Hadamard Conjecture 1.2. There exists a (4n) × (4n) Hadamard matrix
for every n.

These are the only possible cases since for n = 2m + 1, a maximal set of

orthogonal Hadamard vectors contains just two vectors.

In this paper we will prove the following theorem.

Theorem 1.3. In a space of dimension m = 2n, any maximal set of dis-
tinct Hadamard vectors can be partitioned into 22n−n−1 Hadamard matrices.
Moreover, this result fails for all other values of m.

2. Some Elemntary Observations

We make a few simple observations.

Observation 2.1. If we can prove that just one choice of a maximal set of
distinct Hadamard vectors can be partitioned into Hadamard matrices, then
this is also true for any choice of distinct Hadamard vectors.

This is clear since any second choice of distinct Hadamard vectors has
the property that for any vector x in this set, either x or -x is in the ﬁrst
set. And so the partition of the ﬁrst set is a partition of the second set with
perhaps sign changes of some rows of the Hadamard matrix - which is still
an orthogonal matrix.

Observation 2.2. The moreover part of the theorem is essentially obvious.

Given any m = 4n, if we can partition the 24n−1 distinct Hadamard
vectors into (4n) × (4n) Hadamard matrices, let k be the number of such
matrices. Then k · (4n) uses up all the distinct Hadamard vectors and so

k · (4n) = 24n−1, and so m divides 24n−1.

We will do the proof by induction on n with the case n=2 below:

A = 


+ − − +




B = 


+ + + −
+ + − +
+ − + +
+ − − −




3. Proof of the Theorem

We assume the theorem holds for m = 2n and we have partitioned a dis-
tinct set of Hadamard vectors into Hadamard matrices {Ai}22n
and let
i=1
j=1 be the row vectors of Ai. We will construct 22n+1−(n+1)−1 matrices
{xij}2n
of distinct Hadamard vectors of order 2n × 2n+1 so that cutting each of these
matrices vertically in half, each of the left halves and the right halves are
orthogonal matrices. For each of these, say [A B], we then take:

−n−1

(1)

(cid:20)A B
A −B(cid:21)

and have a partition of distinct Hadamard vectors into Hadamard matrices.
Since the total number of vectors here is equal to the total number of dis-
tinct Hadamard vectors for 22n+1
, we are done. It will be obvious from our
construction that the vectors we construct are unique.

For any n, we deﬁne the row shift of an n × n matrix A with row vectors

{xi}n

i=1 by:

Tn =

0 0 0 · · ·
1 0 0 · · ·
...
...
0 0 0 · · ·

...

...




0 1
0 0
...
...
1 0




so that Tn

x1
x2
x3
...
xn









=

xn
x1
x2
...
xn−1









For the construction, for each Ai, Aj above, we form the 22n × 22n+1

matrices:

(cid:2)Ai

T k

mAj(cid:3) for all k = 1, 2, . . . , 2n.

Since the rows of Ai are orthogonal, the above matrices are pairs of orthog-
onal matrices and so are orthogonal. Note that each of the 22n−n−1 A′
is is
paired with all the other 22n−n−1 A′
js and each is paired with 2n shifts of
the rows. So the total number of matrices above is:

22n−n−1 · 22n−n−1 · 2n == 22n+1−(n+1)−1.

I.e. We have used up all the distinct Hadamard vectors in a space of dimen-
sion 2n+1.
