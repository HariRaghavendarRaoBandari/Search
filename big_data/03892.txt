Abstract

The class of all locally quasi-convex (lqc) abelian groups contains all locally convex vector spaces (lcs) considered as topolog-
ical groups. Therefore it is natural to extend classical properties of locally convex spaces to this larger class of abelian topological
groups. In the present paper we consider the following well known property of lcs: ”A metrizable locally convex space carries
its Mackey topology ”. This claim cannot be extended to lqc-groups in the natural way, as we have recently proved with other
coauthors ([1], [15] ). We say that an abelian group G satisﬁes the Varopoulos paradigm (VP) if any metrizable locally quasi-
convex topology on G is the Mackey topology. Surprisingly VP - which is a topological property of the group - is characterizes an
algebraic feature, namely being of ﬁnite exponent. .

Keywords: Metrizable abelian groups, locally quasi-convex topologies, torsion groups, precompact topologies, locally convex
spaces, Mackey topology.

1 Introduction.

1.1 Historical background and some facts on the Mackey topology.

Locally convex topologies on linear spaces are a topic which has boosted a wide research in Functional Analysis. It was proved
by G. Mackey [22] that the family of compatible locally convex topologies on a locally convex space has a top element. That
is, for a (real or complex) locally convex space E with dual space E′, there exists a locally convex topology µ = µ(E, E′) with
(E, µ)′ = E′, such that any other locally convex topology ν on E the dual of which is E′, satisﬁes the inequality ν ≤ µ. The
topology µ satisfying these conditions is named the Mackey topology of E. The following result will be the inspiring source for
our reﬂections on abelian topological groups.

Theorem 1.1 [21, Corollary 22.3, page 210] Metrizable locally convex linear topological spaces carry their Mackey topology.

A parallelism between real topological vector spaces and abelian topological groups can be established if the dualizing object
in the framework of abelian topological groups is taken as the circle group T (or equivalently the quotient group R/Z). The role of
linear forms is played now by characters, and the dual group of a topological abelian group G is now G∧ := CHom(G, T). Another
group topology on a topological group G will be called compatible if it gives rise to the same dual group G∧. These basic concepts
permit to study duality in the class of abelian topological groups.

The notion of quasi-convex subsets of a topological abelian group (Vilenkin, [24]) paved the way to formulate the questions
underlying the Mackey theory from topological vector spaces to the class of abelian groups. A decade after the introduction of
locally quasi-convex groups, Varopoulos tried to extend the Mackey theory to abelian groups, seemingly unaware of the work of
Vilenkin. For this goal he focused on locally precompact groups, a subclass of the class of locally quasi-convex groups. He proved
that a metrizable locally precompact topological abelian group carries the ﬁnest compatible locally precompact group topology
[23]. That is, a metrizable locally precompact group is Mackey in the class of locally precompact groups (or Lpc-Mackey, in
terms of Deﬁnition 1.3).

In 1999 in [8] a framework was established to generalize the Mackey theory for locally convex spaces to the larger class of
locally quasi-convex groups. Although a topological vector space is locally convex if and only if it is locally quasi-convex as a
topological group [4, 2.4], there are some obstructions to extend the Mackey-Arens theorem to the class of locally quasi-convex
groups, so the Mackey problem is stated as follows in [8]:

Problem 1.2 [8] Let (G, τ) be a locally quasi-convex topological group. Let C(G, τ) denote the family of all locally quasi-convex
group topologies which are compatible with τ.

1. Does there exist a top element in the family C(G, τ)?

If it exists, we denote it by µ = µ(G, τ). Then (G, µ) will be called a Mackey group and µ the Mackey topology for (G, τ).

In the class Lqc there always exists a bottom element in C(G, τ), namely the weak topology on G induced by (G, τ)∧. So in

case a precompact topology is Mackey (cf. Theorem B (ii)), then it is the unique compatible topology.1

This problem is a specialization of a more general one. In order to formulate it we need the following:

Deﬁnition 1.3 Let G be a class of abelian topological groups and let (G, τ) be a topological group in G. Let CG(G, τ) denote the
family of all G-topologies ν on G compatible with τ. We say that µ ∈ CG(G, τ) is the G-Mackey topology for (G, G∧) (or the
Mackey topology for (G, τ) in G) if ν ≤ µ for all ν ∈ CG(G, τ).
If G is the class of locally quasi-convex groups Lqc, we will simply say that the topology is Mackey.

Remark 1.4 The Mackey topology exists in G if and only if the supremum of two compatible topologies in G is again compatible.2

Problem 1.5 Let G be a class of topological abelian groups. Does there exist a top element in the family CG(G, τ), i.e., does the
G-Mackey topology exist ?

3
The problem whether the Mackey topology exists, in the setting of Lqc-groups, is so far open. Under some constrains on the
starting topological group it does. For instance, in the following classes of topological groups, the Mackey topology exists and it
is precisely the original one:4

Theorem 1.6 [8] Let (G, τ) be a locally quasi-convex topological group satisfying one of the following conditions:

1. G is Baire and separable.

2. G is ˇCech-complete (in particular, if G is metrizable and complete).

3. G is pseudocompact.

Then τ is the Mackey topology for (G, τ).

The fact that every metrizable and complete locally quasi-convex group is Mackey, points out an analogy between topological

groups and linear topological spaces where the counterpart of this result is available (see Theorem 1.1).

There are metrizable locally quasi-convex groups which are not Mackey. Thus completeness seems to be an essential require-

ment.

Example 1.7 The following groups admit a metrizable non-discrete locally quasi-convex topology which is not Mackey. Since
they are countable they cannot be complete, for otherwise, by the Baire Category Theorem they would be discrete:

(a) The group of the integers Z endowed with any non-discrete linear topology is metrizable and locally quasi-convex but fails

to be Mackey ([1]).

(b) The Pr¨ufer groups Z(p∞) endowed with the topology inherited from T are metrizable locally-quasi-convex groups which

are not Mackey ([6]).

(c) The group of rationals Q endowed with the topology inherited from the real line is a non precompact metrizable locally

quasi-convex group which is not Mackey ([6, 12]).

Example 1.8 The following groups are metrizable locally quasi-convex and Mackey:

Let m ≥ 2 be a natural number and consider the direct sum of countable many copies of Zm, Gm :=Lω
topology inherited from the productQω Zm. Then Gm is a metrizable, locally quasi-convex non-complete Mackey group ([7]).

One can also ﬁnd examples with a stronger ﬂavor from Functional Analysis, namely connected, metrizable topological groups
which are not Mackey. Indeed, the group of all the null-sequences on T, endowed with the topology inherited from the product
TN is a metrizable connected precompact locally quasi-convex group topology which is not Mackey ([15]).

Zm endowed with the

1This statement was contained in the former Corollary B 2.
2Do we need a proof here?

Who is asking this ? As far as I remember, this is proved in [8], maybe not exactly in this form (dd)
L: I do not think that we have to give a proof.

3L: We could add the following Remark: According to Barr and Kleisli, the Mackey topology exists in the class of all nuclear groups. The latter class was

introduced by Banaszczyk in [4] and contains all locally compact abelian groups and all nuclear vector spaces.

4L I think the last sentence is somehow misleading, since we know almost nothing about the existence of the Mackey topology in LQC; I suggest to write:
Although almost nothing is known about the existence of the Mackey topology in Lqc, some particular topological properties are suﬃcient for a topology to be
the Mackey topology.

1.2 Main results.

Metrizability alone does not ensure that a locally quasi-convex topology on a group is Mackey, unless it is accompanied (or re-
placed) by an additional topological property (completeness, etc., see Theorem 1.6). This motivates to investigate which additional
properties of algebraic nature, that when imposed along with metrizability guarantees that a locally quasi-convex topology group
is Mackey.

Deﬁnition 1.9 We say that an abelian group G satisﬁes the Varopoulos Paradigm, if every metrizable locally quasi-convex topol-
ogy on G must be a Mackey topology. We brieﬂy denote this by G ∈ VP.

According to the main theorem of this paper, the groups satisfying the Varopoulos Paradigm are exactly the bounded ones:

Theorem A: Let G be an abelian group. Then, the following assertions are equivalent:

(i) G ∈ VP, i.e., every metrizable locally quasi-convex group topology on G is Mackey.

(ii) G is bounded.

For the proof of Theorem A, we will consider separately the cases of bounded and unbounded groups. In each case we will
get one of the implications of Theorem A. In fact, Theorem B is a stronger version of the implication (ii) ⇒ (i) in Theorem A,
while Theorem C is simply the implication (i) ⇒ (ii).
The main result in the case of bounded groups is:

Theorem B: Let G be a bounded abelian group and τ a locally quasi-convex topology on G.

(i) If τ is metrizable, then it is the Mackey topology for G.

(ii) If(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(G, τ)∧(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) < c then τ is precompact and the Mackey topology for G.

Then (G, τ) is Mackey.

In [11, Prop.8.57] Theorem B (ii) was proved by other methods.

Remark 1.10 In [7, Example 4] a weaker version of Theorem B (ii) was shown, namely: Every bounded precompact topological

group (G, τ) with(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(G, τ)∧(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) < c is Mackey.
Corollary 1.11 Let (G, τ) be a locally quasi-convex group topology on a bounded group which is not precompact. Then(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(G, τ)∧(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≥

Immediately from Theorem B (ii) we get:

c.5

Examples 1.12 The following examples shall show that none of the hypotheses of Theorem B can be omitted:

(a) The p-adic topology on Z is locally quasi–convex (even linear), metrizable, and precompact, but it is not Mackey ([1]). Its

dual group has cardinality c.

(b) Consider a D-sequence b = (bn) satisfying bn+1
bn

+ Zo ⊂ T. As proved in [1], τb is metrizable and locally quasi-convex and satisﬁes (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(Z, τb)∧(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) < c but it is not

→ ∞ as in [1]. Let τb be the topology on Z of uniform convergence on

the set n 1

precompact.

bn

(c) The Prfer group Z(p∞) endowed with the topology from T is a prcompact, metrizable torsion group with countable dual

group which is not Mackey according to [6]. This shows that we cannot replace ”bounded” by ”torsion groups”.

(d) The direct sum of c-many copies of Zm endowed with the topology inherited from the product ZR

m is precompact (and linear)
and bounded, but its dual group has cardinality c.6 This shows that the ﬁrst implication of Theorem B (ii) cannot be inverted.

(e) The group G = Lω Z4 endowed with the discrete topology is bounded, locally quasi-convex with(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)G∧(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = c, but it is not

precompact.

(f) Let G be an inﬁnite (bounded) group. Let δ+ denote the Bohr topology on G, i.e. the weak topology on G induced by all
homomorphisms G → T. Then (G, δ+) is (bounded,) precompact, |(G, δ+)| = 2|G| ≥ c and it is not Mackey, as the discrete
topology is Mackey topology for (G, (G, δ+)∧).

From Theorem B (and some extra results from [2]), we compute the cardinality of the family C(G, τ) for a metrizable bounded

group, as expressed next:

Corollary B1: Let (G, τ) be a metrizable, locally quasi-convex and bounded group. Then:

5In the previous version G was assumed to be metrizable, what is not necessary.
6L: Do we know whether this group is Mackey? If so, it would be good to give an argument here.

1. |C(G, τ)| = 1 if and only if τ is precompact. In this case, (G, τ) is precompact and Mackey.

2. Otherwise |C(G, τ)| ≥ 2c. In this case, τ is the only metrizable topology in C(G, τ).

Corollary B1 solves Conjecture 7.6 in [2] for bounded groups.
Let G be a countable7 group. Under Martin Axiom, there exist 2c precompact topologies of weight c on G. Indeed, there exist
22|G|
= 2c precompact -pairwise diﬀerent- topologies on G. We compute the cardinality of precompact topologies with weight < c.
Consider a cardinal8 κ < c. Since every precompact topology of weight κ is determined exactly by a subgroup of G∗ of cardinality
κ, there exist |G∗|κ precompact topologies of weight κ. Now, |G∗| = c, hence |G∗|κ = cκ = (2ω)κ = 2κ M.A.
= c . Consequently, there
exist 2c precompact topologies of weight c on G.

The following question arises:

Question 1.13 Let G be a countable group. How many of the precompact topologies of weight c on G are Mackey? How many
of them fail to be Mackey?

Although we don’t know the answer to this question, we give the following partial answer:

Corollary B 2: Let G be a bounded countably inﬁnite group. Then, there exist c precompact topologies of weight c which are not
Mackey.

all n ∈ N. Hence, we can write G = G1 × G2 where both G1 and G2 are inﬁnite. Since G1 is inﬁnite, there exists a family of c
precompact topologies {τi} on G1 whose weight is < c. 9 Consider the discrete topology d in G2 and in G the product topology,
namely Ti = τi × d. The topology Ti is metrizable (hence, by Theorem B, Mackey) but not precompact (for each i). In addition,
QED

Proof: Since G is bounded and countably inﬁnite, there exists a natural number L such that G = Ln<ω Zmn, where mn < L for
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(G, Ti)∧(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = c. Hence the topologies T +

i are precompact of weight c and not Mackey.

Question 1.14 Does there exist a precompact bounded group of weight c which is Mackey?10

In §2, we prove Theorem B and Corollary B1.

Remark 1.15 We shall show in another paper that in the class of linearly topologized groups the Mackey topology exists and that
every metrizable linear topology is the Mackey topology in this class.

For unbounded groups, the picture is completely diﬀerent.

In fact, on any unbounded topological group we can build a
metrizable locally quasi-convex group topology which is not Mackey. This is Theorem C, which is the main result in this direction:

Theorem C: If G is an unbounded group, then G < VP, i.e., there exists a metrizable locally quasi-convex topology on G which is
not Mackey.

The proof of Theorem C, given in §3, is based in the following facts:

• Z, Z(p∞) and Q have a metrizable locally quasi-convex non-Mackey topology (see Example 1.7).

• Every unbounded group G has a subgroup of the form Z, Z(p∞), Q orL∞

with lim mn = ∞ [19].

n=1 Zmn, where p is a prime and (mn) is a sequence

• Open subgroups of Mackey groups are Mackey (Lemma 3.2).

As a by-product, the construction in Proposition 3.5 (of a compatible locally quasi-convex topology ﬁner than the product
topology) can be used to provide c many pairwise non-isomorphic metrizable locally precompact linear group topologies on the
group Q/Z and all its subgroups of inﬁnite rank (compare with Example 1.7(c), where the single topology with similar properties
is not linear).

1.3 Notation and terminology.

The symbols N, Z, Q, C, Z(p∞), T will stand for the natural numbers, the integer numbers, the rational numbers, the complex
numbers, the Pr¨ufer groups and the unit circle of the complex plane respectively. Using the structure of C, in particular, the real
part function Re(z) for z ∈ C, we let T+ = T ∩ {z ∈ C : Re(z) ≥ 0} (although we frequently identify T with the quotient group R/Z,
if the additive notation is more convenient). The group Zm denotes the cyclic group of m elements. For an abelian group G, we

For a topological group (G, τ) its dual group is the group of continuous homomorphisms CHom(G, T), and will be denoted
by (G, τ)∧ or G∧ if the topology is clear. For an abelian group G, we say that τ and ν are compatible if (G, τ)∧ = (G, ν)∧. For a
topological group (G, τ), we denote by C(G, τ) the family of all locally quasi-convex topologies on G which are compatible with
τ. A subgroup H ≤ G of a topological group is dually closed if for any x < H, there exists φ ∈ G∧ satisfying that φ(H) = 0 and
φ(x) , 0.

direct sumLκ G of κ copies of G.

For an abelian group G and a subgroup H ≤ Hom(G, T) we shall denote by σ(G, H) the weak topology on G induced by the
elements of H. When the initial group is a topological group, then G∧ ≤ Hom(G, T) is a subgroup and we write τ+ instead of
σ(G, G∧). The topology τ+ is usually called the Bohr topology of (G, τ). Obviously, H is dually closed if it is τ+-closed. If G
carries the discrete topology, the corresponding Bohr topology has remarkable properties (see for example [17]).

A group G is said to be bounded if there exists m ∈ N satisfying that mG = 0. In this case, we will call the exponent of G
to the minimum positive integer satisfying this condition. For a prime number p, we say that a group G is a p-group if for every
x ∈ G there exists a natural number n satisfying that pnx = 0.

Deﬁnition 1.16 Let (G, τ) be a topological group. We say that τ is linear if it has a neighborhood basis consisting in subgroups.
In this case, we say that (G, τ) is linearly topologized.

Deﬁnition 1.17 Let (G, τ) be a topological group. We say that a subset M ⊂ G is quasi-convex if for every x ∈ G \ M, there exists
φ ∈ G∧ satisfying that φ(M) ⊂ T+ and φ(x) < T+. If τ has a neighborhood basis consisting in quasi-convex sets, we say that τ is
locally quasi-convex.

Further, we set for a subset M ⊆ G M⊲ = {χ ∈ G∧ : χ(M) ⊆ T+} and for a subset N ⊆ G∧ N⊳ = {x ∈ G : χ(x) ∈ T+ ∀χ ∈

N}.

For the reader’s convenience, we include a proof of the following result, which can be found also in [3, Proposition 2.1].

Proposition 1.18 Let (G, τ) be a locally quasi-convex bounded group. Then τ is linear.

Proof: Suppose that mG = 0. Let U be a quasi-convex neighborhood of 0 in G. It is well known that U ⊲ is an equicontinuous
subset of G∧. Hence there exists a neighborhood W of 0 in G such that χ(W) ⊆] − 1
m [+Z for all χ ∈ U ⊲. Since mχ ≡ 0, we
obtain χ(W) ⊆ χ(G) ⊆ { k
m + Z, k ∈ Z}. Combined with the above inclusion, this yields χ(W) = {0} for every χ ∈ U ⊲. This means
W ⊆ (U ⊲)⊥. In particular, the subgroup (U ⊲)⊥ ⊆ (U ⊲)⊳ = U is open.

QED

Corollary 1.19 The notions Lin-Mackey and Mackey are equivalent for bounded groups.

We will consider the following notation for some classes of topological groups:

• Lin (resp., Lin-Mackey) – for the class of linearly topologized Hausdorﬀ groups.

• Lpc (resp., Lpc-Mackey) – for the class of locally precompact groups.

• Lqc (resp., Lqc-Mackey) – for the class of locally quasi convex Hausdorﬀ groups.

Since locally quasi-convex groups generalize locally convex spaces, the most natural class G to study Mackey topologies is

the class of locally quasi-convex groups. Hence, we write simply Mackey for Lqc-Mackey.

2 The bounded case: proofs of Theorem B and Corollary B1

Proposition 2.1 Let G be an abelian group. If τ, τ′ are compatible topologies on G, they share the same dually closed subgroups.

Proof: The assertion trivially follows from these two facts:

(a) both topologies have the same weak topology σ(G, G∧);

(b) a subgroup H of G is dually closed (with respect to any of these two topologies) precisely when it is σ(G, G∧)-closed.

QED

Next, we want to show that a metrizable locally quasi-convex bounded group is Mackey. For the proof we need the following

Proposition which is interesting on its own:

Proposition 2.2 Let (G, τ) be a torsion, metrizable non-discrete abelian group. Then there exists a homomorphism f : G → T
which is not continuous.

Proof: Since G is metrizable and τ is not the discrete topology, we can choose a null-sequence (an)n∈N which satisﬁes an , am
whenever n , m and an , 0 for all n ∈ N. Since every ﬁnitely generated torsion group is ﬁnite we may additionally assume that
an+1 does not belong to the subgroup generated by a1, . . . , an for every n ∈ N.

We are constructing inductively a homomorphism fn : ha1, . . . , ani → T in the following way:
Let f1 : ha1i → T be a homomorphism which satisﬁes f1(a1) < T+. This is possible, since a1 , 0.
Suppose that fn : ha1, . . . , ani → T is a homomorphism, which satisﬁes fn(ak) < T+ for all 1 ≤ k ≤ n.

If han+1i ∩ ha1, . . . , ani = {0}, we can deﬁne a homomorphism fn+1 : ha1, . . . , an+1i → T which extends fn and satisﬁes fn+1(an+1) <
T+.
If han+1i∩ha1, . . . , ani , {0}, we choose the minimal natural number k ∈ N such that kan+1 = k1a1+. . .+knan for suitable k1, . . . , kn ∈
Z. By assumption, 2 ≤ k < ord(an+1). We deﬁne fn+1(an+1) such that fn+1(an+1) < T+ and fn+1(kan+1) = fn(k1a1 + . . . + knan) and
obtain a homomorphism fn+1 : ha1, . . . , an+1i → T which extends fn.

In this way, we obtain a homomorphism ef : h{an : n ∈ N}i → T which can be extended to a homomorphism f : G → T. By

construction, f satisﬁes:

∀n ∈ N f (an) < T+.

So f is not continuous.

QED

Remark 2.3 (a) Using that no non-trivial sequence can converge in the Bohr topology PG of the discrete group of G ([18]) one
can obtain a proof of a stronger version of the above proposition with “torsion” omitted. (Just take any non-trivial null sequence
(an) as in the above proof and note that it cannot converge in PG, hence there exists a character χ of G witnessing that, i.e., such
that χ(an) 6→ 0 in T; then χ cannot be τ-continuous, as an → 0 in (G, τ).)

(b) If we reinforce the hypothesis of the above proposition replacing “torsion” by “bounded”, the proof can be simpliﬁed in the
following way. Passing to a subsequence of (an) one can achieve to have han+1i ∩ ha1, . . . , ani = {0} to avoid the more complicated
second case (han+1i ∩ ha1, . . . , ani , {0}) in the above proof.

Proof of Theorem B: Let τ be a locally quasi-convex topology on a bounded group G. We have to prove that (G, τ) is a Mackey

group provided that: (i) τ is metrizable; or (ii)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(G, τ)∧(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) < c.

(i) Suppose that τ is metrizable. Let τ′ be another locally quasi-convex group topology on G compatible with τ. According to
1.18, τ and τ′ are linear topologies. We have to show that τ′ ⊆ τ. So ﬁx a τ′-open subgroup H of G and denote by q : G → G/H the
canonical projection. As H is open in (G, τ′), it is also dually closed in (G, τ′) and according to 2.1 also in (G, τ). Let f : G/H → T
be an arbitrary homomorphism. Then f ◦ q ∈ (G, τ′)∧ = (G, τ)∧. Let ˆτ denote the Hausdorﬀ quotient topology on G/H induced
by τ. Of course, (G/H, ˆτ) is a metrizable bounded group. Since every homomorphism f : (G/H, ˆτ) → T is continuous, we obtain
that G/H is discrete by the above Proposition. This implies that H is τ-open. Hence, τ′ ⊆ τ.

open subgroup U ≤ G satisfying that |G/U| ≥ ω. Since U is open, the quotient G/U is discrete. Hence (G/U)∧ is compact and

(ii) Now, suppose that(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(G, τ)∧(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) < c. By Proposition 1.18, τ is linear. Suppose that τ is not precompact. Then there exists an
inﬁnite, therefore(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(G/U)∧(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≥ c. Since (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)G∧(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≥ (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(G/U)∧(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) the inequality(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(G, τ)∧(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≥ c follows. This contradiction shows that τ is

Let τ′ be another locally quasi-convex group topology on G, which is compatible with τ. According to 1.18, τ′ is linear.
As (G, τ′)∧ = (G, τ)∧ is countable, the above argument applied to τ′ shows that τ′ is precompact as well. Since τ and τ′ are
compatible, they must coincide. Therefore, τ is Mackey.

precompact.

Proof of Corollary B1: We have to prove that if (G, τ) is a metrizable, locally quasi-convex and bounded group, then:

1. |C(G, τ)| = 1 if and only if τ is precompact.

2. otherwise |C(G, τ)| ≥ 2c; in this case, τ is the only metrizable topology in C(G, τ).

If |C(G, τ)| = 1 it is clear that τ is precompact (for any dual pair (G, G∧) there exists one precompact topology). Conversely, if

τ is precompact, Theorem B implies that τ is Mackey. Hence it is clear that |C(G, τ)| = 1.

The proof of 2. relies on the fact that τ is linear (Proposition 1.18). Assume that (G, τ) is not precompact. Then, there exists
a τ-open subgroup U such that G/U is inﬁnite. Since U is open, G/U is discrete. By Theorem 3.10 in [2], the family C((G/U)d)

can be embedded in C(G, τ). We denote by F ilG/U the set of all ﬁlters on G/U and we recall that(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)F ilG/U(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = 22|G/U| . By Theorem
4.5 in [2], we have that |C((G/U)d)| =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)F ilG/U(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12), since G/U has inﬁnite rank (being an inﬁnite bounded group). So

|C(G, τ)| ≥ |C((G/U)d)| = 22|G/U|

≥ 22ω

= 2c

holds. It is also clear from Theorem B, that τ is the only metrizable topology in C(G, τ).

3 The unbounded case: proof of Theorem C

In order to prove that unbounded groups do not ﬁt into Varopoulos paradigm, we need ﬁrst to prove that the Mackey topology is
”hereditary” for open subgroups. In other words, an open subgroup of a Mackey group is also a Mackey group in the induced
topology. To this end we recall next an standard extension of a topology from a subgroup to the whole group.

Deﬁnition 3.1 Let G be an abelian group and H a subgroup. Consider on H a group topology τ. We deﬁne the extension τ of τ
as the topology on G which has as a basis of neighborhoods at zero the neighborhoods of (H, τ).

If the topology τ on H is metrizable, the topology τ on G is metrizable. Analogously, if τ is locally quasi-convex, then τ is also
locally quasi-convex (indeed, a subset which is quasi-convex in H is quasi-convex in G, due to the fact that H is an open subgroup
in τ).

Lemma 3.2 Let H be an open subgroup of the topological group (G, τ). If τ is the Mackey topology, then the induced topology τ|H
is also Mackey. As a consequence, if ν is a metrizable, locally quasi-convex non-Mackey group topology on H, then there exists a
metrizable locally quasi-convex-group topology on G which is not Mackey, namely ν.

Proof: In order to prove that (H, τ|H) is also a Mackey group take a locally quasi-convex topology ν in H such that (H, ν)∧ =
(H, τ|H)∧. Let ν be the extension of ν to G.

Let us prove that (G, ν)∧ = (G, τ)∧. Take φ ∈ (G, ν)∧. Then φ|H is ν-continuous, and, since ν and τ|H are compatible, φ|H is also
a character of (H, τ|H). Since H is τ-open, φ is τ-continuous. Thus (G, ν)∧ ≤ (G, τ)∧. The same argument can be used to prove the
converse inequality, taking into account that H is an open subgroup in ν. So ν and τ are compatible topologies.

Since (G, τ) is Mackey, we obtain that ν ≤ τ and this inequality also holds for their restrictions to H, ν ≤ τ|H. Hence (H, τ|H)

is Mackey.

Let ν be a metrizable locally quasi-convex group topology on H which is not Mackey and ν its extension to G. Clearly, H
is ν-open, and ν is a metrizable locally quasi-convex topology on G. If ν were Mackey, by our previous arguments, ν should be
QED
Mackey as well, a contradiction.

We do not know if the converse of Lemma 3.2 holds in general:

Question 3.3 Let (G, τ) be a topological group and H ≤ G an open subgroup. If τ|H is the Mackey topology, is τ the Mackey
topology for G?

We prove it for the class of bounded groups.

Proposition 3.4 Let (G, τ) be a bounded topological abelian group and H ≤ G an open subgroup. If (H, τ|H) is Mackey, then
(G, τ) is Mackey.

Proof: Let τ′ be a locally quasi-convex group topology on G which is compatible with τ. Note ﬁrst that τ, τ′, τ|H and τ′
topologies (Proposition 1.18). We are going to prove that τ|H and τ′

|H are compatible.

Let χ : (H, τ) → T be a continuous character. Since H is an open subgroup of (G, τ), there exists a continuous character

|H are linear

Assume conversely, that χ ∈ (H, τ′|H)∧. Since χ is τ′-continuous, there exists an open subgroup U ∈ τ′ such that χ(H ∩ U) =
{0}. Hence the mapping χ′ : H + U → T, h + u 7→ χ(h) (h ∈ H and u ∈ U) is a well deﬁned homomorphism which extends χ.
As χ′(U) = {0}, we obtain that χ is τ′|H+U is continuous. Since H + U is an open subgroup of (G, τ′), χ′ can be extended to a

eχ ∈ (G, τ)∧ extending χ. Since τ′ is compatible with τ, we obtaineχ ∈ (G, τ′)∧ and hence χ|H ∈ (H, τ′|H)∧.
continuous homomorphismeχ ∈ (G, τ′)∧ = (G, τ)∧. As above, this shows that χ|H ∈ (H, τ|H)∧.

|H ≤ τ|H. Since H open in τ, it follows that τ′ ≤ τ′ ≤ τ = τ where τ and τ′ denote the
extensions to G. Since τ|H locally quasi-convex and H an τ-open subgroup, the topology τ is locally quasi-convex and consequently
QED
the Mackey topology on G.

Since τ|H is Mackey, we have that τ′

Proposition 3.5 Let (mn) be a sequence of natural numbers with mn → ∞ and G = L Zmn. Then the metrizable locally quasi-
convex topology τ on G inherited from the productQω Zmn is not Mackey.

Observe that G∗ =Q Z∧

τc the topology of uniform convergence on c, τc is non-precompact, and strictly ﬁner than τ, but still compatible. Hence, τ is not

Proof of Theorem C: We have to prove that for any unbounded abelian group G, there exists a metrizable locally quasi-convex
group topology which is not Mackey. We divide the proof in three cases, namely:

(a) G is non reduced.

(b) G is non torsion.

(c) G is reduced and torsion.

(a) If G is non reduced, write d(G) its maximal divisible subgroup. Then d(G) (cid:27)Lα Q ⊕L∞

i )(βi) [19, Theorem 21.1].
If α , 0, then we there exists H ≤ G, where H (cid:27) Q. Since, there exists a metrizable non-Mackey topology on Q ([6]), applying

i=1 Z(p∞

Lemma 3.2, G is not Mackey as well.

If α = 0, then there exists pi satisfying Z(p∞

i ) ≤ d(G) ≤ G. Since there exists a metrizable, non-Mackey topology on Z(p∞
i )

([6]), there exists (by Lemma 3.2) a metrizable topology on G which is not Mackey.

(b) If G is non torsion, there exists x ∈ G, such that hxi (cid:27) Z. Equip hZi with the b-adic topology, which is metrizable but not

Mackey ([1]). Applying Lemma 3.2, we get the result.

(c) We can write G as the direct sum of its primary components, that is G =Lp Gp. Consider two cases:
(c.1) Gp , 0 for inﬁnitely many prime numbers p. Then, for some inﬁnite set Π of prime numbers,we haveLp∈Π Zp ֒→ G. By
Lemma 3.5, there exists a metrizable locally quasi-convex group topology onLp∈Π Zp which is not Mackey. Hence, by Lemma

3.2, there exists a metrizable locally quasi-convex group topology which is not Mackey on G.

(c.2) Gp , 0 for ﬁnitely many p. Then, one of them is unbounded, say Gp. Let B := L∞

i.e., B is pure and Gp/B is divisible [19]. Let us recall the fact that purity of B means that pnB = pnG ∩ B for every n ∈ N.

(αn)
pn be a basic subgroup of Gp,

n=1 Z

We aim to prove that B is unbounded. Assume for contradiction that B is bounded, so pnB = 0 for some n ∈ N. Then
{0} = pnB = pnG ∩ B. One has (pnGp + B)/B (cid:27) pnGp/(pnGp ∩ B) = pnGp/pnB (cid:27) pn(Gp/B) = Gp/B; the last congruence holds,
since B is pure in Gp and the last equality is a consequence of the divisibility of Gp/B.12 This means that pnGp + B = Gp. Since
pnGp ∩ B = 0, this is equivalent to Gp = pnGp ⊕ B. Then pnGp (cid:27) Gp/B is a divisible subgroup of the reduced group Gp. Hence
pnGp (cid:27) Gp/B = 0 and Gp = B is bounded, a contradiction.

Since B is unbounded there exists a sequence (ni) ⊆ N with αni , 0 such that L∞
exists a metrizable locally quasi-convex group topology onL∞

metrizable locally quasi-convex group topology which is not Mackey on G.

i=1 Zpni ≤ B ≤ G. By Lemma 3.5, there
i=1 Zpni which is not Mackey. Hence, by Lemma 3.2, there exists a

Now we can prove the main theorem.

Proof of Theorem A: We have to prove that for an abelian group G the following assertions are equivalent:

(i) Every metrizable locally quasi-convex group topology on G is Mackey.

(ii) G is bounded.

(i) implies (ii) is Theorem C. (ii) implies (i) is Theorem B.
