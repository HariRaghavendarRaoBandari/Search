A Real-Space Cluster-Dynamical Mean Field Approach to the Falicov-Kimball Model:

An Alloy-Analogy Approach

(Dated: March 2, 2016)

It is long known that the best single-site coherent potential approximation (CPA) falls short of
describing Anderson localization (AL). Here, we study a binary alloy disorder (or equivalently, a
spinless Falicov-Kimball (FK)) model and construct a dominantly analytic cluster extension that
treats intra-cluster (1/d, d=spatial dimension) correlations exactly. We ﬁnd that, in general, the
irreducible two-particle vertex exhibits clear non-analyticities before the band-splitting transition
of the Hubbard type occurs, signaling onset of a novel type of localization at strong coupling.
Using time-dependent response to a sudden local quench as a diagnostic, we ﬁnd that the long-
time wave function overlap changes from a power-law to an anomalous form at strong coupling,
lending additional support to this idea. Our results also imply such novel “strong” localization in
the equivalent FK model, the simplest interacting fermion system.

PACS numbers: 71.30.+h 72.10.-d 72.15.Rn

Anderson’s seminal paper [1] spawned the fertile ﬁeld
of localization in disordered systems. While all states in
spatial dimension d = 1, 2 are long known to be local-
ized for any arbitrary disorder in the “weak” localiza-
tion sense, strong enough disorder is generally expected
to lead to exponential localization in all d. In a distinct
vein, the exact and otherwise successful mean-ﬁeld theory
of AL, the coherent potential approximation (CPA) can-
not, by construction, describe AL, since it cannot account
for coherent backscattering processes that underpin AL.
Nevertheless, CPA has been used in the Vollhardt-W¨olﬂe
(VW) theory to obtain a phase diagram with AL and
metallic phases [2]. Other schemes marry the CPA with
typical medium theory (TMT) to study AL [3]. However,
given the necessity of including non-local correlations,
several heavily numeric-based cluster approaches [4–6]
have also been devised with mixed success.
In addi-
tion, the simplest model of correlated fermions on a lat-
tice, the Falicov-Kimball model (FKM), is isomorphic to
the binary-alloy Anderson disorder model, and exhibits
a continuous metal-insulator transition of the Hubbard
band splitting type [7]. One might thus expect the above
issues to be relevant for the FKM as well. To our knowl-
edge, a dominantly analytic approach to cluster-based
techniques in such contexts remains to be attempted, and
is potentially of great interest.

Recent work on many-body localization [8] suggest
that at strong disorder, the localization length is of order
a lattice constant (ξ ≃ 1). In this limit, an exact treat-
ment of inter-site “disorder” (1/d) correlations beyond
DMFT may thus be adequate to describe “strong” local-
ization. Non-local response to a sudden local quench (a
suddenly switched-on localized hole) in this regime ex-
hibits a statistical orthogonality catastrophe (sOC), also
studied earlier in the context of correlated impurity po-
tentials in a fermi gas [9]. Thus, qualitative change in the
long-time response of a system to a sudden local quench,

wherein the explicit long-time wave function overlap un-
dergoes a qualitative change at strong disorder, can be a
novel diagnostic of strong localization. Can we study how
the long-time response to a sudden local quench evolves
across the MIT in the FKM, and can such an endeavor
provide deeper insight into “strong” localization at a con-
tinuous metal-insulator transition?

In this paper, we develop an analytic cluster-DMFT
for the non-interacting Anderson disorder or FK model

on a Bethe lattice. The vi are random variables with a bi-
nary alloy distribution: P (vi) = (1− x)δ(vi) + xδ(vi − v).
Relabeling vi = U nid where nid = d†
i di is the occupa-
tion number of a spinless non-dispersive fermion state
(nid = 0, 1 for all i). The mapping between the two
models implies that the ni,d are randomly distributed
according to the above binary alloy distribution. We ex-
tend earlier two-site cluster-DMFT [10] (we use the same
notations here as in Ref[10]), wherein a crucial advance is
to go beyond the DMFT-like site-local Weiss ﬁeld to one
that explicitly incorporates full intra-cluster disorder cor-
relations (see below for details) via a matrix Weiss ﬁeld.
This is a non-trivial step, and is necessary to obtain the
correct causal cluster propagators and self-energies. A
unique and very attractive aspect of our c-DMFT is that
we obtain explicit closed-form expressions for the clus-
ter propagators (thus self-energies and irreducible charge
vertices): while HAM is known to be analytically solv-
able in d = ∞ [11], a dominantly analytic cluster exten-
sion has remained elusive, though the problem has been
tackled numerically [4–6]. Remarkably, one just needs
to solve two coupled non-linear algebraic equations for a
two-site cluster (N equations for a N -site cluster) leading
to extreme computational simpliﬁcation, even with ﬁnite

Notice the appearance of a higher-order GF on the rhs
of Eq. (4). It is naturally interpreted as the probability

alloy short-range order (SRO). This makes it very at-
tractive for use for real correlated systems in conjunction
with multiband DMFT or cDMFT. We will be speciﬁ-
cally concerned with studying quantum critical aspects
at the the Hubbard type of a continuous MIT accom-
panied by band splitting. Extensions to study Anderson
localization within the formalism developed in this paper
are very interesting, but is deferred for the future.

MODEL AND SOLUTION

The ﬁrst step is the construction of a suitable clus-
ter model Hamiltonian incorporating diagonal disorder.
Motivated by the above discussion, we generalize the An-
derson disorder problem to ﬁnite dimensions by mapping
the full Anderson (or FKM in the alloy analogy approx-
imation) model,

H = −t X<i,j>,σ

to an eﬀective model of a cluster of Nc sites embedded in
an eﬀective (dynamical) bath with a complex self-energy
(matrix of size N 2
c ). Here, we assume a binary alloy
distribution for disorder, P (vi) = (1 − x)δ(vi − vA) +
xδ(vi − vB), and further, that < vivj > − < vi ><
vj >= fij ≡ C, a constant parameter. Strictly speaking,
the SRO encoded in fij is a function of x, temperature
and other variables depending on the speciﬁc physical
situation under consideration, and in real materials, this
dependence should be explicitly taken into account.

In contrast to CPA, the method described below is
tailor made to capture the dynamical eﬀects of repeated
scattering from a cluster of sites, which are correlated in
a manner described by fij over the cluster length scale.
To proceed, we start with the embedded cluster Hamil-
tonian,

and,

where 0, α denote a two-site cluster, and the third term
describes the hybridization of the boundary of the cho-
sen cluster with (the last term) an eﬀective medium (con-
duction electron bath function) that has to be self consis-
tently determined by a suitable imbedding procedure (for
a single- site, this is the well-known CPA). We describe
the details in course of the derivation below.

Deﬁning the diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal propagators on

where A0α = 1, x0, xα, x0xα for the various types of
Green functions which couple the bath back to the clus-
ter (see above), and < x0α >≡< x0xα > is the non-
local correlation function of the disorder potential over
the cluster length scale (scaling like 1/d in d dimensions).
It is this last equation which is the generalization of our
earlier work [10] which used a DMFT-like lattice self-
consistency. For a single site cluster, we recover the exact
CPA result using the EOM for G00σ, Gk0σ, < x0c0σ; c†

GENERAL FORMALISM FOR THE TWO-SITE

CLUSTER METHOD

We can also exactly estimate the cluster irreducible
vertex functions and (charge) susceptibility by generaliz-
ing the well-known procedure employed in DMFT stud-
ies [11].
It turns out that exploiting cluster symmetry
is particularly useful in this instance, and markedly sim-
pliﬁes the analysis. The solution of the two site cluster
impurity problem gives the following matrix Green func-
tion and the self energy,

ˆG = (cid:18) G00 G0α

G0α G00 (cid:19) , ˆΣ = (cid:18) Σ00 Σ0α

Σ0α Σ00 (cid:19) ,

To go over to a representation where these matrices are
diagonal in the cluster momenta, K points, KI = (0, 0, ..)
and KII = (π, π, ..). we divide the Brillouin zone into two
sub-zones as done in CDMFT studies for the Hubbard
model [12]. For brevity, we label Region I and II by S
and P respectively. Now, self energy and Green function
matrices take on the diagonalized forms,

ˆG = (cid:18) GS

where,

and,

with,

GS = G00 + G0α, GP = G00 − G0α

ΣS = Σ00 + Σ0α, ΣP = Σ00 − Σ0α

In this representation, it turns out to be easier to com-
pute the irreducible vertex functions. Speciﬁcally, the
only quantity relevant for the disorder problem is the ir-
reducible particle-hole (p-h) vertex function ˆΓ is given
as ˆΓ = δ ˆΣ
δ ˆG (the “spin ﬂuctuation” and “pairing” vertex
appear in the FKM, but are irrelevant for the disorder
problem). Since both self energy and Green function ma-
trices are diagonal in the S(P) basis, the vertex function
is separable with respect to the S or P channel as well:

than the K-dependent spectral functions, are given by,

(22)

CALCULATION OF CHARGE SUSCEPTIBILITY

With explicit knowledge of the p-h irreducible vertex
as above, the momentum-dependent susceptibility cor-
responding to the S(P) channels is evaluated using the
Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE),

χS(P )(q, iωm, iωn; iνl) = χ0

S(P )(q, iωm; iνl)δmn − T Xn′

χ0
S(P )(q, iωm; iνl) ×ΓS(P )(iωm, iωn′; iνl)χS(P )(q, iωn′, iωn; iνl)
(24)

To make progress, we proceed along lines similar to those
adopted in DMFT studies [11].

(i) The full susceptibility is found by summing over
the fermionic Mastubara frequencies, χS(P )(q, iνl) =

T Pmn χS(P )(q, iωm, iωn; iνl).

As, χS(P ) are diagonal in S or P channel, we keep only the

RESULTS

One-Particle Spectral Response

We now present our results. We work with a semi-
circular unperturbed density of states (DOS) as appro-
priate for a Bethe lattice in high-D, given by ρ0(ǫ) =

(2/πD)√D2 − ǫ2 where D = 2t is the c-fermion band
width. We begin with a “particle-hole symmetric” case
with hnici = 1/2 and a probability distribution, P (vi) =
1/2[δ(vi) + δ(vi − v)] or, in the FKM context with a half-
ﬁlled c-fermion band. In Fig. 1, we show the local DOS
(LDOS) as U/t is increased through a critical (U/t)c =
1.8, where a continuous metal-insulator transition (MIT)

(32)

of the Mott-Hubbard type occurs via the Hubbard-band
splitting. Comparing with the exact DMFT solution [11],
we see that incorporation of dynamical eﬀects of 1/D
correlations in our two-site CDMFT gives rise to addi-
tional features in the LDOS. These features arise from
repeated scattering of the electrons oﬀ spatially separated
scattering centers and are visible even for the totally
random case, deﬁned as f0α = hx0xαi − hx0ihxαi = 0.
In the lower panel, we show the LDOS for the asym-
metric FKM, with hni,di = hxii = 0.45, wherein loss
of particle-hole symmetry is faithfully reﬂected as an
asymmetric LDOS. It is clear that the MIT is associ-
ated with a genuine quantum critical point (QCP). The
advantage of CDMFT is that cluster spectral functions,
deﬁned as A(K, ω) with K = (0, 0), (π, π) can be explic-
itly read oﬀ. In Fig. 2, we exhibit A(K, ω) as a function
of U/t. It is obvious that ρS(ω) = A(K = (0, 0), ω) =
ρP (−ω) = A(K = (π, π),−ω) for the particle-hole sym-
metric case, as it must be. For the Bethe lattice, we
ﬁnd that the LDOS, ρ(ω) = C|ω|1/3 exactly at the QCP
((U/t)c = 1.8), a result similar to that found for the same
model in DMFT [13]. The spectral functions also exhibit
these singular features, albeit in a K-dependent fash-
ion. Notwithstanding these similarities, we stress that
our extension of DMFT faithfully captures the feedback
of the non-local (intracluster) correlations on the single-
particle DOS and the self-energies (see below) in contrast

FIG. 1: (Color online) The local density of states (LDOS)
of the binary-alloy disorder model for p-h symmetry (upper
panel) and p-h asymmetric case (lower panel). A clear con-
tinuous band-splitting transition of the Hubbard (or Falicov-
Kimball model-like) variety is seen in both cases. At (U/t)c =
1.8, the LDOS exhibits a critical |ω|1/3 singular behavior in
both cases.

to DMFT, where such 1/D feedback eﬀects are absent.
In Fig. 3, we exhibit the imaginary part of the cluster-
local self-energy, ImΣ00(ω) for the same parameter values
as above. For small U/t, ImΣ00 weakly depends on ω,
and is sizable only near ω = 0. However, it has the wrong
sign, i.e, a minimum, instead of a maximum characteris-
tic of a Landau Fermi liquid, at ω = 0. Thus, the metallic
state is incoherent and not a Landau Fermi liquid (LFL).
This is again a feature in common with DMFT studies.
In DMFT, it is well known that this feature becomes
more prominent as U/t increases, and diverges at the
MIT [11]. In CDMFT, however, ImΣ00 develops marked
structure already at (U/t) = 1.0: it develops a maximum
at ω = 0, which progressively sharpens up with increasing
U/t in the incoherent metallic regime. Interestingly, (i)
right at (U/t)c (blue curve), ImΣ00(ω) = c|ω|1/3, rem-
iniscent of what is expected in a power-law liquid,
in
strong contrast to what happens in DMFT, where it di-
verges. For (U/t) > (U/t)c, opening up of a “Mott” gap
in the LDOS goes hand-in-hand with vanishing ImΣ00(ω)
in the gap. In all cases, we also ﬁnd power-law fall-oﬀ in
self-energies at high energy and, more interestingly, clear
isosbestic points (where ImΣ00(ω) is independent of ω)
at Ω = ±0.2t. We also ﬁnd (see lower panel) that moving

For the p-h symmetric case, the symmetry relation ρS(ω) =
ρP (−ω) is clearly satisﬁed as it must be (upper panel).

away from p-h symmetry does not qualitatively change
the above features.

Finally, CDMFT allows a direct evaluation of the
K-dependent self-energies, which we exhibit in Fig. 4
and Fig. 5. As a cross-check, we ﬁnd that ImΣ(K =
(0, 0), ω) =ImΣ(K = (π, π),−ω), as required by particle-
hole (p-h) symmetry for hni,di = 0.5.
In Fig. 6, we exhibit the imaginary parts of the cluster-
momentum-resolved irreducible particle-hole vertex func-
tions as functions of U/t. It is clear that both, ImΓ(K, ω)
with K = (0, 0) (called “S”) and with K = (π, π)
(called “P”) show non-analyticities precisely at ω = 0
at (U/t)c = 1.8 (blue curves). Thus,
for the com-
pletely random case, we ﬁnd, as expected, that the
“Mott” QCP is signaled by a clear non-analyticity in the
momentum-dependent (irreducible) p-h vertices at the
Fermi energy (ω = 0). This non-analytic feature goes
hand-in-hand with a power-law variation of ImΣS(P )(ω)
in the vicinity of the Fermi energy (ω = 0). Along
with spectral functions and self-energies, the vertex func-
tions also satisfy the “symmetry” relation, ImΓ(K =
(0, 0), ω) = −ImΓ(K = (π, π),−ω) for the p-h symmet-
ric case. Clearly, the anomalous infra-red behavior of the
irreducible vertices is directly related to the clear non-
analytic structures in the cluster self-energies discussed
above.

FIG. 3: (Color online) ImΣ00(ω) vs U/t for the binary-ally
disorder problem for the same parameters as in Fig. 1. For
small U/t, our results agree with self-consistent Born approx-
imation (constant ImΣ00(ω)). As U/t increases, ImΣ00(ω)
develops marked low-energy structure, and at (U/t)c = 1.8,
ImΣ00(ω) ≃ |ω|1/3, reﬂecting the non-perturbative nature of
the “Hubbard III” quantum criticality.

fects captured by CDMFT become apparent upon re-
peating the above procedure for the case of ﬁnite “alloy”
short-range order (SRO), namely, when f0α = hx0xαi −
hx0ihxαi 6= 0.

In Fig. 7, Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, we exhibit the cluster self-
energies and p-h vertices for the case of f0α = −0.15,
which represents the physical situation with short-range
“antiferro” alloy correlations on the two-site cluster.
Now, the MIT occurs at a critical (U/t)c1 = 1.35, smaller
than for the completely random case. The reason is sim-
ple: on very general grounds, short-ranged “antiferro”
alloy correlations suppress the one-electron hopping by
a larger amount compared to the random case (this is
also reﬂected in the deeper pseudogap in the incoher-
ent metal for f0α < 0), simply because the probability
for an electron to hop onto its neighbor on the cluster
is reduced when there is more probability of having a
local potential U on the neighboring site. In this case,
ImΣ(K, ω) shows, on ﬁrst glance, a behavior similar to
the case with f0α = 0 described before. Upon closer
scrutiny of Fig. 8, however, we ﬁnd that ImΣ(K, ω) al-
ready diverges for (U/t) = 1.3, slightly before Hubbard
band-splitting occurs (black curve). Also, Fig. 8 also
clearly shows the power-law divergence of the self-energy

FIG. 4: (Color online) Same as Fig. 3, but now for the cluster-
momentum resolved self-energies. It is clear that the symme-
try relation ImΣS(ω) =ImΣP (−ω) holds in the p-h symmetric
case.

FIG. 6:
(Color online) Imaginary parts of the irreducible
particle-hole vertex functions in the S, P channels as a func-
tion of U/t for the binary-alloy disorder model. Clear non-
analyticities in ΓS,P (ω) at ω = 0 occur precisely at (U/t)c =
1.8, where the continuous Hubbard band-splitting transi-
tion occurs.
In addition, the results conﬁrm the symmetry

(black and blue curves), with ImΣ00(ω) ≃ |ω|−η, with
η = 1/3 at the MIT. This new feature is very diﬀer-
ent from the pole-divergence of the self-energy in the
Hubbard model within DMFT, but is indeed seen in the
DMFT solution for the FKM when the self-energy and
the vertex function are treated consistently at the lo-
cal level [19]. A related non-analyticity in ImΓ(K, ω)
also correspondingly occurs at precisely the same value
in Fig. 9. Thus, in this case, we ﬁnd that the irreducible
p-h vertex diverges before the actual MIT occurs. Such
features are also known for the D = 2 Hubbard model
within the dynamical vertex approximation [14]. How-
ever, this divergence of the vertex function is not as-
sociated with (∂Σ00(ω)/∂ω)ω=0 = ∞, where the actual
“Mott” transition occurs. Thus, it is neither connected
to any symmetry-breaking (which would require a diver-
gence in the momentum channel), nor does it lead to
non-analyticities in the one-particle response (the LDOS
remains smooth for all (U/t) < (U/t)c1 = 1.35).

Thus, at the level of spectral

functions and self-
energies, our CDMFT for the FKM ﬁnds universal fea-
tures at a quantum-critical “Mott” transition that are
qualitatively similar to those found by Janis et al. [19] We
ﬁnd that the infra-red non-analytic behavior in Γ(K, ω)

FIG. 7:

electron spectral functions as a function of U/t for the short-
range ordered binary alloy in the p-h symmetric case. As
expected, the continuous “Hubbard” transition now obtains
at a smaller (U/t)c = 1.35, due to enhanced suppression of
itinerance by the “anti-ferro” alloy short-range order (f0α =
−0.15 < 0). As for the totally random alloy, the symmetry re-
lation for the spectral functions still holds. The LDOS shows
very similar quantum-critical singular features at low energy
at (U/t)c.

precedes the MIT. This was probably to be expected,
since both approaches deal with quasi-local quantum crit-
icality suited to the Mott-Hubbard problem. The advan-
tages of our extension relate to (i) having a CDMFT that
always respects causality [10], and (ii) enables computa-
tion of momentum-resolved spectral responses, even for
the hitherto scantily considered cases of explicit “alloy”
short-range order. Importantly, having an almost ana-
lytic cluster extension of DMFT means that we have to
simply deal with N coupled non-linear algebraic equa-
tions to compute the full CDMFT propagators for a N -
site cluster, even with short-range order. This is an enor-
mous numerical simpliﬁcation when one envisages its use
for real disordered systems, with or without strong Hub-
bard correlations: these issues have long been extremely
well-studied using the coherent-potential approximation
(CPA) and DMFT [15]. We anticipate wide uses of such
a semi-analytic approach as ours in this context.

FIG. 8:
(Color online) Imaginary parts of the cluster-
momentum resolved one-particle self-energies as a function
of U/t for the short-range ordered binary alloy. The symme-
try relation for the cluster self-energies still holds, as does the
fact that both show critical power-law behavior at (U/t)c (see
text).

FIG. 9:
(Color online) Imaginary parts of the cluster-
momentum resolved irreducible p-h vertex functions for the
p-h symmetric short-range ordered binary alloy as a function
of U/t. Clear non-analyticities in both ΓS,P (ω) occur slightly
before the Hubbard-type band-splitting transition occurs, sig-
nifying the onset of a novel kind of localization (see text).

In addition to universal critical features found in the
last section within an exact-to-O(1/D) CDMFT for the
FKM, additional details regarding the nature of this
strong-coupling “Mott” transition can be gleaned from
examination of the two-particle response.
In particu-
lar, the dynamic charge susceptibility of the FKM can
also be precisely computed in our approach by using the
CDMFT propagators (GS(P )(k, ω)) and the irreducible
p-h vertices ΓS(P )(ω) (notice that the latter have depen-
dence on the cluster momenta K) in the Bethe-Salpeter
equation, as detailed in “Model and Solution” section.

In Fig. 10, we show the imaginary part of the full
cluster-local dynamical charge susceptibility as U/t in-
creases. On ﬁrst glance, our results are quite similar
to those in earlier DMFT work [11]. Beginning from
small U/t up to U/t ≃ 1.2, Imχch(ω) varies linearly
with ω in the infra-red, with a maximum at interme-
diate energy, followed by a high-energy fall-oﬀ. How-
ever, closer scrutiny of the strong-coupling (U/t ≥ 1.4)
regime reveals that this behavior undergoes a qualita-
tive change at low energies: now Imχch(ω) ≃ ω1−κ,
with 0 < κ(U/t) < 1.
It is important to notice that
the conﬁgurationally averaged DOS does not show any
non-analyticities in this regime, and the system is close
to, but not in the “Mott” insulating regime. A closer

look at the behavior of the cluster self-energies and irre-
ducible vertex functions in this regime shows that both
begin to acquire non-trivial energy dependence at low
energy when U/t is close to the criical value needed for
the “Mott” transition to occur.
In fact, as described
before, (see both Im ΓS(P )(ω) start exhibiting strong ω-
dependence, especially near ω = 0, when U/t ≥ 1.4, and
clear non-analyticities accompanied by anomalous power-
law variation near ω = 0 when one is very close to the
transition in the range 1.7 < (U/t) < 1.8. Thus, it is clear
that the anomalous low-energy behavior of the collective
charge ﬂuctuations is linked to the strong ω-dependence
and impending non-analytic behavior in the cluster irre-
ducible vertex as the MIT as approached from the metal-
lic side. Thus, while the fact that the vertex diverges
before the actual MIT does not lead to non-analyticity in
the one-electron spectral functions, it does qualitatively
modify the collective density ﬂuctuations, reﬂecting in
an anomalously overdamped critical form. We are un-
aware of such a connection existing within earlier DMFT
studies [11] and this qualitatively new feature has not
previously been noticed, to our best knowledge.

One interpretation of this unusual feature is the fol-
lowing. Close to the Hubbard band splitting (“Mott”)
transition, one generically expects formation of excitons.

FIG. 10: (Color online) The imaginary part of the local com-
ponent of the full dynamical charge susceptibility for the p-h
symmetric binary alloy disorder model in the totally random
case (f0α = 0). Up to (U/t)1 = 1.4, Imχloc
ch (ω) ≃ ω, similar to
its DMFT counterpart. However, for 1.5 ≤ (U/t) ≤ (U/t)c =
1.8, Imχloc
ch (ω) ≃ ω1−κ where 0 < κ(U/t) < 1 and κ reduces
with increasing U/t, reaching a value κ = 0.5 at (U/t)c. This
has very unusual consequences for the long-time response to
a “sudden” local quench at strong coupling (see text).

A simple way to understand this is in terms of the
“holon-doublon” mapping of the model, which is a par-
tial particle-hole transformation where c† → c†, d → d†.
Now U Pi ni,cni,d → −U Pi(ni,cni,d−ni,c), whereby the
c, d fermions experience an on-site attraction, leading to
formation of local “pair” bound states (these are excitons
i d†
in the original model) of the type hc†
ii. Quite generally,
in a Hubbard model, one expects these bosons to Bose-
condense. An upshot thereof is the well-known fact that
this is nothing else but antiferromagnetic magnetic order,
now interpreted as a Bose condensate of spin excitons. In
our simpliﬁed FKM or binary-alloy case, however, such
a BEC is explicitly forbidden by the fact that the lo-
cal Z2 gauge symmetry, associated with [ni,d, H] = 0
for all i, cannot be spontaneously be broken by Elitzur’s
theorem. This still leaves open the possibility of having
inter-site excitonic pairing of the c-fermions on the two-
site cluster. Without global broken symmetry, such a
state would be a dynamically ﬂuctuating excitonic liq-
uid. One would expect that a phase transition to a
“solid” of such excitonic pairs will eventually occur, per-
haps as a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transi-

10

tion [20], but this is out of scope of the present work.
However, having strong inter-site excitonic liquid ﬂuctu-
ations could cause the irreducible charge vertices to ex-
hibit precursor features, and it could be that our ﬁnding
above is a signal of such an impending instability. More
work is certainly needed to put this idea on a stronger
footing, but this requires a separate investigation.

Finally, one would expect emergence of anomalous fea-
tures in vertex functions and charge ﬂuctuations close to
the MIT to have deeper ramiﬁcations. Speciﬁcally, we
now address the question outlined in the Introduction:
“Can we study the long-time response of the FKM to
a sudden local quench, and can such an endeavor pro-
vides deeper insight into the “strong” localization aspect
inherent in a continuous “Mott” transition?” In other
words, if we introduce a local, suddenly switched-on po-
tential in the manner of a deep-core hole potential in
metals, how would the long-time response of the “core-
hole” spectrum evolve with U/t? In the famed instance
of a Landau Fermi liquid metal, the seminal work of An-
derson [16], Nozieres and de Dominicis [17] (AND) leads
to the result that at long times, the core-hole propaga-
tor, related to the wave function overlap between the
ground states without and with the suddenly switched
potential, goes like a power-law: ρh(t)|t→∞ ≃ t−α with
πα =tan−1(Vhρc(0)) being the (s-wave for a local scalar
potential) scattering phase shift. It has also long been
shown that [18] the deep reason for this feature is that
the particle-hole ﬂuctuation spectrum, ρph(ω) (related to
the collective charge ﬂuctuation response), in a Fermi gas
is linear in energy. Explicit evaluation of the core-hole
response when e − e interactions in the Landau Fermi
liquid sense are present is a much more involved and del-
icate matter [19]. It is clear that qualitative change(s) in
the low-energy density ﬂuctuation spectrum must quali-
tatively modify the long-time response to such a sudden
quench.

Answering this question in our case of the FKM is
a subtle matter, since the c-fermion spectral function
is not that of a Landau Fermi liquid, but describes an
incoherent non-Landau Fermi liquid state. As long as
Imχch(ω) ≃ ω holds, however, we expect that the long-
time response will be similar to that evaluated by Ja-
nis [19] using rather formal Wiener-Hopf techniques. Ul-
timately, the long-time response still behaves in a quali-
tatively similar way to that for the free Fermi gas, ex-
cept that the exponent in the power law is modiﬁed
by interactions (thus, Imχch(ω) ≃ ω still holds, but
with sizable renormalization). In our case, we thus ex-
pect that ρh(t)|t→∞ ≃ t−α still holds for U/t < 1.3,
since we do ﬁnd Imχch(ω) ≃ ω in this regime in the
infra-red. However, the qualitative change to the form
Imχch(ω) ≃ ω1−κ with 0 < κ < 1 in the infra-red for
(U/t) ≥ 1.4 must also qualitatively modify the long-time
overlap and the “core-hole” response.
Rather than resort to a direct computation of the long-

time response within CDMFT, we will ﬁnd it more in-
structive to consider this issue by using the low-energy re-
sults gleaned from CDMFT as inputs into an elegant ap-
proach ﬁrst used in the context of the seminal X-ray edge
problem by Schotte et al. [21] and by M¨uller-Hartmann
et al [18]. To this end, we have to identify the collec-
tive charge ﬂuctuations encoded in χch(ω) with a bath of
bosonic particle-hole excitations in the incoherent metal.
Generally, using the linked cluster expansion, the spec-
tral function of the localized “core-hole” is

Sh(ω) =

1

2π Z ∞

−∞

0

h Z ∞

dEImχph(E)

dteiωtexp[V 2

e−iEt − 1
E2
(33)
where Vh is the “suddenly switched” core-hole poten-
tial. As long as Imχph(E) ≃ E, we estimate, simi-
lar to the well-known result, that the core-hole spec-
function behaves like Sh(ω) ≃ ω−α with α =
tral
(1/π)tan−1(Vhρ00(0)), with ρ00(0) being the CDMFT
LDOS at the Fermi energy (in a full computation, this
exponent will change a bit because ρ00(ω) has sizable fre-
quency dependence close to ω = 0 at strong coupling in
the metal as found in Results, but the qualitative fea-
tures will survive). However, when U/t ≥ 1.4, having Im
χch(ω) ≃ ω1−κ must modify this well-known behavior.
In this regime we ﬁnd (see also Ref. [18]) the following
leading contribution to the core-hole spectral function

Sh(ω) ≃

V 2
h
EF

(34)

which is qualitatively distinct from the well-known form,
and corresponds to a long-time wave function overlap
having a very non-standard form: ρh(t)|t→∞ ≃ e−t1−κ
.
This qualitative modiﬁcation of the long-time wave func-
tion overlap is a strong manifestation of a novel type of
localization at work. It would be tempting to associate
this with a many-body localized regime, especially since
the Landau quasiparticle picture is also violated within
this strong-coupling regime, but more work is called for
to clinch this issue. The basic underlying reason for this
novel behavior is the same as the one leading to gen-
eration of the anomalous exponent κ in the p-h ﬂuctu-
ation spectrum, i.e, strong ω-dependence and incipient
non-analyticity in the irreducible p-h vertex close to the
MIT.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Using the disordered binary alloy analogy extended to
a two-site cluster, we have investigated 1/D eﬀects on
the continuous MIT in the ”simpliﬁed” FKM (by this, we
mean a FKM where the disorder is quenched, rather than
annealed, so quantities like hx0i and f0α are ﬁxed and

11

given from a binary distribution, rather than computed
self-consistently, as in the true FKM). In spite of this
simpliﬁcation, we ﬁnd that quantum critical features at
the level of one-electron Green functions and self-energies
are very similar to those obtained from an “Anderson-
Falicov-Kimball” [19] model. This is not so surprising,

since the eﬀect of the FK term, U Pi nidnic is precisely

to generate a band “splitting” for all U/t in the FKM as
well, and a binary alloy disorder indeed has exactly a sim-
ilar eﬀect on the DOS. Thus, within DMFT or cDMFT
approaches such as ours, one would expect quantitative
changes in the spectral functions, but no qualitative mod-
iﬁcation of critical exponents in the LDOS exactly at the
band-splitting Hubbard-like transition.

However,

in strong contrast to the one-electron re-
sponse, inclusion of non-local irreducible p-h vertex in
computation of the dynamic charge susceptibility does
lead to qualitatively new eﬀects at strong coupling. We
have shown that Imχch(ω) ≃ ω1−κ with 0 < κ < 1 to
occur precisely in the same regime where the non-local
vertex shows strong frequency dependence and signs of
an impending non-analyticity (the latter occurs either at
the MIT, or precedes it, see above). This feature is quite
anomalous, indicating that a novel collectively ﬂuctuat-
ing state of the electronic ﬂuid, characterized by infra-red
critical bosonic p-h modes, sets in before the MIT occurs.
Naturally, one expects that this feature will drastically
modify the charge responses in the strong coupling limit:
in fact, related eﬀects should reveal themselves in opti-
cal response of the disordered electron ﬂuid. We leave
detailed elucidation of such points for future work.

To summarize, we have analyzed the role of short-
ranged (spatially non-local) alloy correlations on the
Hubbard-like MIT in a binary disorder Anderson model
at strong coupling in detail. While quantum critical fea-
tures at one-electron level are exactly similar to recent
DMFT results [19] for the disordered FKM, non-local
vertex corrections show up rather dramatically as a qual-
itative change in character of collective p-h spectrum at
strong coupling.
In contrast to previous CPA studies,
this is a concrete manifestation of the relevance of dy-
namical eﬀects associated with 1/D alloy correlations
near the quantum critical point associated with a con-
tinuous MIT of the Hubbard band-splitting type. It is
obviously of interest to elucidate the nature and conse-
quences of this strong coupling QCP in various trans-
port responses. This aspect is under study, and will be
reported separately.
