ABSTRACT

The ﬁrst long-baseline ALMA campaign resolved the disk around the young
star HL Tau into a number of axisymmetric bright and dark rings. Despite
the very young age of HL Tau these structures have been interpreted as signa-
tures for the presence of (proto)planets. The ALMA images triggered numerous

theoretical studies based on disk-planet interactions, magnetically driven disk
structures, and grain evolution. Of special interest are the inner parts of disks,
where terrestrial planets are expected to form. However, the emission from these
regions in HL Tau turned out to be optically thick at all ALMA wavelengths,
preventing the derivation of surface density proﬁles and grain size distributions.
Here, we present the most sensitive images of HL Tau obtained to date with the
Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at 7.0 mm wavelength with a spatial resolution
comparable to the ALMA images. At this long wavelength the dust emission
from HL Tau is optically thin, allowing a comprehensive study of the inner disk.
We obtain a total disk dust mass of (1-3)×10−3 M(cid:12), depending on the assumed
opacity and disk temperature. Our optically thin data also indicate fast grain
growth, fragmentation, and formation of dense clumps in the inner densest parts
of the disk. Our results suggest that the HL Tau disk may be actually in a very
early stage of planetary formation, with planets not already formed in the gaps
but in the process of future formation in the bright rings.

1.

Introduction

HL Tau is a very young solar-type star surrounded by a dusty circumstellar disk and
a remnant envelope. The object is located at a distance of ∼140 pc (Loinard et al. 2007),
within the Taurus star-forming region. Showing all ingredients of a young system in the
earliest stages of planet formation, HL Tau has attracted a lot of attention over the years.
For a summary of the early observational data and the results of the ﬁrst comprehensive
radiative transfer modeling we refer to D’Alessio et al. (1997) and Men’shchikov, Henning
& Fischer (1999).

HL Tau drives an ionized jet indicating on-going accretion (e.g., Pyo et al. 2005, Anglada
et al. 2007). Early interferometric observations revealed that emission at cm wavelengths
traces the radio counterpart of this collimated jet, while the emission at wavelengths (cid:46) 1.3
cm predominantly traces dust emission from a disk (Rodr´ıguez et al. 1994, Wilner et al.
1996). This source attracted renewed interest after high angular resolution interferometric
observations indicated that the HL Tau disk, despite its youth, may already be forming
planets. Observations performed with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave
Astronomy (CARMA) at 1.3 and 2.7 mm (∼20-120 au resolution) suggested a gravitationally
unstable disk which might undergo fragmentation (Kwon et al. 2011). Very Large Array
(VLA) observations at 1.3 cm (∼12 au resolution) revealed a compact structure in the disk at
65 au radius, interpreted as a protoplanet candidate (Greaves et al. 2008). Subsequent high

– 3 –

sensitivity VLA observations at 7.0 mm (∼7 au resolution) could not conﬁrm this putative
proto-planet, but found evidence for a depression at radius ∼ 10 au in the radial density
proﬁle of the disk, which was interpreted as being related to the presence of an orbiting
protoplanet (Carrasco-Gonz´alez et al. 2009).

With the long baselines of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)
becoming available (ALMA Partnership et al. 2015a), this facility produced iconic images of
the dust emission at 2.9, 1.3, and 0.87 mm from the HL Tau disk (∼3.5 to 10 au resolution),
showing a number of axisymmetric bright and dark rings, most probably corresponding to
high and low density concentric dust structures in the disk (ALMA Partnership et al. 2015b).
The images immediately triggered numerous theoretical works in order to explain these
remarkable structures. Planet-related explanations range from the presence of embedded
sub-Jupiter mass planets (Picogna & Kley 2015, Dipierro et al. 2015, Dong et al. 2015) to
individual more massive planets (Gonzalez et al. 2015). Alternative explanations include
magnetized disks without planets (Flock et al. 2015), fast pebble growth near condensation
fronts (Zhang et al. 2015), and sintering-induced dust rings (Okuzumi et al. 2016).

The presence of massive planets (∼10-15 MJ) in two prominent dips in the dust distribu-
tion at ∼70 au was excluded utilizing deep direct L’ band imaging with the Large Binocular
Telescope (LBT) (Testi et al. 2015), but the presence of lower-mass planets in the disk is
not yet excluded and remains an interesting possibility.

Detailed radiative transfer analysis of the ALMA data shows that the emission from
the various bright rings is probably optically thick, even at the longest ALMA wavelength
of 2.9 mm (Pinte et al. 2016, Jin et al. 2016). The challenge of deriving density proﬁles and
grain size distributions can only be circumvented by observations at even longer wavelengths
where the disk will be optically thinner. In this Letter, we present new high-sensitivity Karl
G. Jansky VLA observations at 7.0 mm of the HL Tau disk. This data provide a deeper
view of the HL Tau disk, with an angular resolution comparable to the ALMA images.

2. Observations and image analysis

We observed HL Tau with the VLA of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory
(NRAO)1 using the Q band receivers in the C, B, and A conﬁgurations (see Table 1 for
details). We observed the frequency range 39-47 GHz (central wavelength (cid:39) 7.0 mm). Cal-

– 4 –

ibration of the data was performed with the data reduction package Common Astronomy
Software Applications (CASA; version 4.4.0), using a modiﬁed version of the NRAO calibra-
tion pipeline.

Images were made with the CASA task CLEAN using multi-scale multi-frequency synthe-
sis that ﬁts the emission with a Taylor series with nterms=2 during the deconvolution (Rau
& Cornwell 2011). Since our multi-conﬁguration observations are sensitive to emission at
very diﬀerent scales (from ∼16(cid:48)(cid:48) (cid:39)2240 au to 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)05(cid:39)7 au), we made images with diﬀerent an-
gular resolutions by adjusting the Briggs robust parameter (Briggs 1995) and the Gaussian
uv-taper in CLEAN. We also made images by splitting the 8 GHz band in two sub-bands of
4 GHz each (central wavelengths 6.7 and 7.3 mm). For comparison, images were aligned by
assigning to the position of the central peak of the ALMA images the same absolute coordi-
nates than in the VLA images, α(J2000)=04h31m38s426, δ(J2000)=18◦13(cid:48)57.(cid:48)(cid:48)23. In Figures
1 and 2 we present the VLA images with diﬀerent angular resolutions and comparisons with
the ALMA images.

We obtained radial proﬁles of the intensity of the ALMA images and our most sensitive
VLA image at 7.0 mm (natural weighting; beam size(cid:39)0.(cid:48)(cid:48)067). For a proper comparison,
we convolved all images to a common circular beam size of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)07 (the smallest beam size
obtained from the public 2.9 mm ALMA uv-data with a uniform weighting). From these
images, we obtained the average intensity within concentric elliptical rings of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)01 width at
diﬀerent radii, using the task IRING of the Astronomical Image Processing System (AIPS).
The dimension and orientation of the elliptical rings match those of the HL Tau disk derived
from the ALMA images (inclination angle, i (cid:39)46.72◦, and position angle, P.A.(cid:39)138.02◦;
ALMA Partnership et al. 2015b).

Some contamination from free-free emission from the HL Tau jet is expected at 7.0 mm.
From our 6.7 and 7.3 mm sub-band images we obtain a spectral index of ∼1 at the center
of the disk, consistent with comparable contributions from free-free and dust emission. To
correct for the free-free contamination, we calibrated VLA A conﬁguration archival data at 6
and 2 cm (project code: 12B-272) where emission is dominated by a partially optically thick
radio jet in the NE-SW direction. From these images, the frequency dependence of the jet’s
ﬂux density and angular size (major axis) can be expressed as Sν (cid:39) 280×[ν/10.5 GHz]0.4 µJy
and θmaj (cid:39) 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)10× [ν/10.5 GHz]−1, respectively, consistent with previous 7 mm observations
(e.g. Wilner & Lay 2000). Thus, an upper limit to the free-free contribution at 7.0 mm
is obtained by extrapolating the ﬂux density from cm wavelengths with a spectral index of
0.4, while a lower limit can be obtained by assuming free-free emission becomes optically
thin at 2 cm (i.e., spectral index of −0.1 from 2 cm to shorter wavelengths). Therefore, we
expect unresolved (<0.(cid:48)(cid:48)07) free-free emission with a ﬂux density in the range ∼200-400 µJy

– 5 –

corresponding to ∼35-65% of the 7.0 mm emission at the disk center. This correction implies
a larger uncertainty in the dust intensity at the center of the disk.

From the corrected intensity proﬁles, we derived brightness temperatures at each wave-
length using the Planck equation for blackbody radiation, and we computed spectral indices
between diﬀerent wavelengths. We also derived proﬁles of optical depth and column density
(assuming dust temperature power-laws and opacity, see §3.1). Radial proﬁles are shown in
Figure 3.

3. Results and discussion

The recent ALMA images of the HL Tau disk revealed several dark and bright rings
(named D1-D7 and B1-B7, respectively) (Fig. 1). Our new 7.0 mm VLA observations are
the most sensitive and highest angular resolution observations of the HL Tau disk performed
to date at such a long wavelength. The low-angular resolution 7.0 mm image shows an
elliptical source with similar size and orientation as the ALMA images (Fig. 1). At higher
angular resolution, the VLA is able to image with high signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio (>4-σ)
the 7.0 mm emission from the inner half of the disk ((cid:46)50 au; see Figs. 1 and 2). In our
7.0 mm images we clearly identify several of the features seen in the ALMA images: the
central disk and the ﬁrst pair of dark (D1) and bright (B1) rings (Figs. 1-3).

The importance of our sensitive 7.0 mm images is that, at such long wavelength, the
emission has lower optical depth than in the ALMA data. This is especially critical for the
study of the innermost part of the disk, where dust becomes opaque at all ALMA wavelengths
and, as a consequence, physical properties are poorly constrained even with detailed modeling
(e.g. Pinte et al. 2016, Jin et al. 2016). At the positions of the most opaque regions, the
center of the disk and the ﬁrst bright ring, the 7.0 mm brightness temperatures (∼45 and
15 K, resp.) are ∼4 times lower than those of the ALMA 0.87 mm image (∼130 and 60
K, resp.). Therefore, assuming that at 0.87 mm the emission from these two structures is
optically thick, we obtain optical depths (cid:46)0.4 at 7.0 mm. This imply that dust emission at
7.0 mm is well optically thin at all radii, even in the densest parts of the disk.

Our new high sensitivity 7.0 mm images of the HL Tau disk are an excellent basis for
future comprehensive radiative transfer modeling to accurately obtain the physical properties
of the disk. They are especially necessary in order to better constrain properties in the inner
disk regions, where terrestial planets are thought to form, in principle.

In the following, we analyze our VLA images of the HL Tau disk to obtain direct rough
estimates of the diﬀerent physical parameters (e.g., mass and grain size distributions). We

– 6 –

also analyze possible substructure in the disk and discuss our results in the context of planet
formation.

3.1. Mass distribution

An accurate determination of the mass distribution in the HL Tau disk requires de-
tailed radiative transfer modeling. For this paper, we obtain ﬁrst estimates by assuming
a simple power-law for the dust temperature in the form Tdust = T0(R/R0)−q. While the
exponent seems to be well constrained in the range q=0.5-0.6 by previous studies, there is
large uncertainty in the reference temperature, with diﬀerent proposed values in the range
T0 (cid:39)70-140 K at R0=10 au (e.g., Men’shchikov et al. 1999, Kwon et al. 2011, Pinte et al.
2016). For the dust opacity at 7.0 mm, we use a range of typical values for the disk-averaged
opacity, κ7mm =0.13-0.2 cm2 g−1 (e.g., Men’shchikov et al. 1999, P´erez et al. 2012). Thus,
at each radius, we calculate ranges for the optical depth and the dust column density taking
into account these uncertainties (see Fig. 3). Our calculations are consistent with the inner
features of the disk being optically thick at all ALMA wavelengths, while at 7.0 mm the
emission is optically thin at all radii (see Fig. 3b). We estimated values of the dust column
density around ∼1 g cm−2 at the center of the disk (see Fig. 3c). This suggest a denser
disk at inner radii (<50 au) than previously obtained by detailed modeling (e.g., Pinte et al.
2016 predict (cid:46)0.2 g cm−2 at the center of the disk).

We also estimated dust masses for the inner disk (ID) and the bright rings (B1 to B6;
see Table 2). For those features which are optically thin in the ALMA images, i.e. B2-B6,
we obtain dust masses consistent with previous estimations (Pinte et al. 2016). However,
our optically thin 7.0 mm data suggest large dust masses for the inner disk and the ﬁrst
bright ring (B1) for which only lower limits were obtained previously (see Table 2). Finally,
we estimate that the total dust mass of the disk is within the range (1-3)×10−3 M(cid:12), which
is also somewhat larger than previous estimates, ∼(0.3-1)×10−3 M(cid:12) (e.g., Men’shchikov et
al. 1999, D’Alessio et al. 1997, Kwon et al. 2008, Pinte et al. 2016).

3.2. Dust particle-size distribution

Grain growth and mixing lead to changes in particle-size distribution and dust composi-
tion throughout the disk (Henning & Meeus 2011). This has been recently studied in several
objects for which segregation by particle-size (e.g. Menu et al. 2014) and radial changes in
dust optical properties (e.g. Guilloteau et al. 2011, P´erez et al. 2012, 2015) are observed.

– 7 –

The fully resolved ALMA and VLA images of the HL Tau disk oﬀer now an excellent
opportunity for a detailed study of the properties of the particle-size distribution in a very
young disk. In particular, changes in the dust properties can be inferred from changes in
the spectral index of the emission, α, but only for optically thin emission in the Rayleigh-
Jeans regime (e.g. Beckwith et al. 2000). When derived from the short ALMA wavelengths,
the observed radial variations of α, from ∼2 to 2.5 (Figure 3d), reﬂect high optical depths
inwards of ∼50 au. Thus, these ALMA observations cannot be used to infer grain growth in
the densest, inner disk regions. In contrast, the observed radial variations of α derived from
the two most optically thin wavelengths, 7.0 and 2.9 mm, show a diﬀerent behavior: (1)
at all radii, except at the location of the dark gap D5, we obtain α7.0−2.9mm > α1.3−0.87mm,
consistent with the emission at shorter wavelengths being more optically thick and not in the
R-J regime, and (2) a clear gradient in α7.0−2.9mm is observed between ∼10-50 au, consistent
with a change in the dust optical properties and a diﬀerential grain-size distribution, with
larger grains at smaller radii. Similar results have been inferred for a number of more evolved
disks (e.g. P´erez et al. 2012, 2015; Tazzari et al. 2016, Menu et al. 2014).

3.3. Substructure in the ﬁrst bright ring

Some more evolved transitional disks, when observed at long wavelengths, show knotty
rings of dust emission (e.g., HD 169142; see Fig. 1c in Osorio et al. 2014). Our highest
angular resolution VLA images of the young HL Tau disk also reveal an interesting knotty
and not axisymmetric morphology of the ﬁrst bright ring (B1) (see Fig. 2b). Most of
the knots seem to be consistent with small (1-σ) ﬂuctuations of the brightness (due to the
rms noise of the map), suggesting a structure with a roughly uniform brightness. However,
to the NE, there is a compact knot (labeled as “clump candidate” in Figs. 2b-d) whose
morphology is very diﬀerent to the rest of the ring. We made several images with diﬀerent
angular resolutions and diﬀerent bandwidths (see §2), and noted that, while the knotty
emission changes signiﬁcantly in diﬀerent images (consistent with being small ﬂuctuations
in a uniform structure), the NE knot is clearly identiﬁable and the most compact knot in all
the images (see Figs. 2c and 2d). This knot also coincides with a local intensity maximum
in the 1.3 mm ALMA image (see Fig. 2b). All this suggests that the 7.0 mm NE knot traces
a real structure in the ﬁrst bright ring.

We note that the position of the NE knot is coincident with the direction of the jet,
and thus it could be related to a local increase in the ﬂux density because of the foreground
free-free emission. However, at 7.0 mm, the free-free emission from the jet is expected to be
conﬁned within the inner disk (see §2). Moreover, from our sub-band images we derive a

– 8 –

spectral index α6.7−7.3mm=2.5±0.4, suggesting that the emission from this knot is dominated
by thermal dust emission. We also noted that this spectral index is slightly smaller than
the average spectral index obtained for B1 from 7.0 and 2.9 mm (see Fig. 3), suggesting an
accumulation of larger dust grains in the clump. It is known that dense rings could undergo
vortex formation by the Rossby Wave Instability and eﬃciently concentrate large particles
(Meheut 2012), then, we speculate that the NE knot traces a dense dust clump formed within
the massive bright ring. In this case, we estimate a dust mass in the range 3-8 M⊕ for this
clump.

3.4. Planet formation in the HL Tau disk

The presence of dark and bright concentric rings has been commonly interpreted as
the result of planet formation already ongoing in the HL Tau disk. However, since HL Tau
is a very young T Tauri star, the presence of several (proto)planets suﬃciently massive
to carve holes in the disk at this early stage is somewhat surprising. On the other hand,
alternative formation mechanisms, not requiring the presence of protoplanets, seem also
possible. Moreover, sensitive searches for massive (proto)planets in the outer dark rings
have yielded negative results (see §1 and references therein).

We propose a scenario in which the HL Tau disk may have not formed planets yet, but
rather is in an initial stage of planet formation. Instead of being caused by (proto)planets,
the dense rings could have been formed by an alternative mechanism. Our 7.0 mm data
suggest that the inner rings are very dense and massive, and then, they can be gravitationally
unstable and fragment. It is then possible that the formation of these rings result in the
formation of dense clumps within them like the one possibly detected in our 7.0 mm image.
These clumps are very likely to grow in mass by accreting from their surroundings, and then
they possibly represent the earliest stages of protoplanets. In this scenario, the concentric
holes observed by ALMA and VLA would not be interpreted as a consequence of the presence
of massive (proto)planets. Instead, planets may be just starting to form in the bright dense
rings of the HL Tau disk.

Note. — The bandpass, ﬂux density
and phase calibrators were 3C84, 3C147 and
J0431+1731, respectively. The phase calibra-
tor was observed every 3 minutes for the C
conﬁguration observations, and every 2 min-
utes for the B and A conﬁgurations obser-
vations. We estimate a 10% uncertainty for
the absolute ﬂux calibration. Quoted ﬂux
errors in discussion are statistical uncertain-
ties.
Self-calibration was achieved. The
phase center was α(J2000)=04h31m38s429,
δ(J2000)=18◦13(cid:48)57.(cid:48)(cid:48)29.

aCalculated by integration of the column density proﬁle obtained

from the 7.0 mm data between adjacent dark rings.

bCalculated by radiative transfer modeling of the ALMA images by

Pinte et al. (2016).

Fig. 1.— Comparison between the ALMA and VLA observations of the HL Tau disk. Left: ALMA image
at 1.3 mm. Center: VLA image at 7.0 mm with an angular resolution of ∼20 au (0.(cid:48)(cid:48)15; tapered image).
Right: Close-up to the center of the disk. VLA image at 7.0 mm with an angular resolution of ∼10 au
(∼0.(cid:48)(cid:48)07; natural weighting). In all panels, the positions of the reported dark (D1-D7; dotted lines) and bright
rings (B1-B7; dashed lines) from the ALMA images (ALMA Partnership et al. 2015b) are shown. The inner
disk and the ﬁrst pair of dark (D1) and bright (B1) rings are clearly seen in the 7.0 mm images.

Fig. 3.— Radial proﬁles of several quantities in the HL Tau disk. In all panels, the width of the lines
represents the 1-σ uncertainty of each quantity. (a) Brightness temperature at diﬀerent wavelengths (2.9, 1.3
and 0.87 mm from ALMA; 7.0 mm from VLA). Obtained by averaging the intensity in concentric ellipses over
the ALMA and VLA images convolved to a common circular beam size of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)07. A dust temperature power-
law, also convolved to a beam size of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)07, is also shown (see §3.1). (b) Optical depth obtained by assuming
the dust temperature proﬁle in panel (a). The thick dashed horizontal line marks the threshold between
optically thin (<1) and optically thick (>1) emission. (c) Column density proﬁle obtained from the 7.0 mm
data and the dust temperature proﬁle. (d) Spectral index proﬁles between several wavelengths. Error bars
in bottom-right corner indicate uncertainties due to absolute ﬂux calibration (not aﬀecting spectral index
gradient).
