Abstract

ΛHe to 209

The spectral function of the Λ hyperon in ﬁnite nuclei is calculated from the corresponding Λ
self-energy, which is constructed within a perturbative many-body approach using some of the
realistic hyperon-nucleon interactions of the J¨ulich and Nijmegen groups. Binding energies,
wave functions and disoccupation numbers of different single-particle states are obtained for
various hypernuclei from 5
ΛPb. The agreement between the calculated binding energies
and experimental data is qualitatively good. The small spin-orbit splitting of the p−, d−, f−
and g−wave states is conﬁrmed. The discrete and the continuum contributions of the single-Λ
spectral function are computed. Their appearance is qualitatively similar to that of the nucleons.
The Z-factor, that measures the importance of correlations, is also calculated. Our results show
that its value is relatively large, indicating that the Λ hyperon is less correlated than nucleons.
This is in agreement with the results obtained by other authors for the correlations of the Λ
in inﬁnite nuclear matter. The disoccupation numbers are obtained by integrating the spectral
function over the energy. Our results show that the contribution of the discrete part of the Λ
self-energy is always much more smaller than the continuum one. This indicates that, in the
production reactions of hypernuclei, the Λ hyperon is mostly formed in a quasi-free state.

1. Introduction

The study of hypernuclei, bound systems composed of nucleons and one or more hyperons,
provides a unique tool to extent our present knowledge of conventional nuclear physics to the
SU(3)-ﬂavour sector.

Hypernuclei were discovered in 1952 with the observation of a hyperfragment in a ballon-
ﬂown emulsion stak by Danysz and Pnieski [1]. These initial cosmic-ray observations of hy-
penuclei were followed later by pion and proton beam production reactions in emulsions and 4He
bubble chambers. The weak decay of the Λ hyperon into a π− plus a proton was used to identify
different Λ-hypernuclei and to determine the binding energies, spins and lifetimes for hypernu-
clei up to A = 15 [2, 3]. Average properties of heavier systems were estimated from spallation
experiments, and two double-Λ hypernuclei were reported from Ξ− capture [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
More systematic investigations of hypernuclei began with the advent of separated K− beams,

which allowed to produce single Λ-hypernuclei through (K−, π−) strangeness exchange reac-
tions, where a neutron hit by a K− is changed into a Λ emitting a π−. The analysis of these
reactions, initially carried out at CERN and later at BNL, KEK and J-PARC, showed many of the
hypernuclear characteristics such as, for instance, the small spin-orbit strength of the hyperon-
nucleon (YN) interaction, or the fact that the Λ essentially retains its identity inside the nucleus.
The use of π+ beams at BNL, KEK and GSI has permitted to perform (π+, K +) associate pro-
duction reactions, where an s¯s pair is created from the vacuum, and a K + and a Λ are produced
in the ﬁnal state. The electro-production of hypernuclei at JLAB and MAMI-C by means of
the reaction (e, e′K +) provides a high precision tool for the study of hypernuclear spectroscopy
[11] due to the excellent spatial and energy resolution of the electron beams. The HypHI col-
laboration at FAIR/GSI has recently proposed a completely new and alternative way to produce
hypernuclei by using stable and unstable heavy ion beams [12]. A ﬁrst experiment has been
already performed using a 6Li beam on a 12C target at 2 A GeV, in which the Λ and the 3
ΛH and
ΛH hypernuclei have been observed [13].
4

Nowadays more than 40 single Λ-hypernuclei, and few double-Λ [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14]
and single-Ξ [15, 16] ones have been identiﬁed. On the contrary, it has not been possible to
prove without any ambiguity the existence of Σ-hypernuclei, which suggest that the Σ-nucleon
interaction is most probably repulsive.

A simple theoretical description of Λ-hypernuclei consist of an ordinary nuclei with the Λ
sitting in the single-particle states of an effective Λ-nucleus mean ﬁeld potential. Several ap-
proaches, based on this simple description, have been used to study the properties of the Λ in
ﬁnite nuclei. Woods-Saxon potentials, for instance, have been traditionally used to describe, in
a shell model picture, the single-particle properties of the Λ from medium to heavy hypernu-
clei [17, 18, 19, 20]. Density dependent effects and non-localities have been included in non-
relativistic Hartree–Fock calculations with Skyrme type YN interactions in order to improve the
overall ﬁt of the single-particle energies [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. Hypernuclear struc-
ture calculations have been also performed on the framework of relativistic mean ﬁeld theory
[30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39] and Dirac phenomenology [40, 41]. Several hypernu-
clear structure studies based on ab-initio approaches exist in the literature [42, 43, 44, 45, 46,
47, 48, 49, 50]. In these studies the single-particle properties of the Λ in the hypernucleus are
derived from an effective YN G-matrix built from a realistic bare YN interaction which describes
the scattering data in free space. Recently, a Quantum Monte Carlo calculation of single- and
double-Λ hypernuclei has also been done using two- and three-body forces between the Λ and
the nucleons [51, 52].

In most of these approaches, the quality of the description of hypernuclei relies on the va-
lidity of the mean ﬁeld picture. However, the correlations induced by the YN interaction can
substantially change this picture and, therefore, should not be ignored. Whereas the correlations
of nucleons in nuclear matter and ﬁnite nuclei have been extensively studied by many authors
(see e.g., Refs. [53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71] and
references therein), the correlations of hyperons have not received so much attention up to date.
To the best of our knowledge, the effect of the Λ correlations in nuclear matter, beyond the mean
ﬁeld description, have been only studied by Robertson and Dickhoff [72, 73]. These authors
used the Green’s function formalism [74] to study for the ﬁst time the propagation of a Λ in nu-

2

clear matter. They calculated the spectral function and quasi-particle parameters of the Λ ﬁnding
results qualitatively similar to those of the nucleons, and showed that the Λ is, in general, less
correlated than the nucleons.

The knowledge of the single-particle spectral function of the Λ in ﬁnite nuclei is fundamental
not only to determine up to which extent the mean ﬁeld description of hypernuclei is valid, but
also for a proper description of the cross section of the different production mechanism of hyper-
nuclei. Information on the single-Λ spectral function can be obtained from a combined analysis
of data provided by e.g., (e, e′K +) reactions or other experiments with theoretical calculations.
However, as far as we know, until now the single-Λ spectral function in ﬁnite nuclei has never
been calculated. The scope of this work is to determine it for a variety of hypernuclei. To such
end, we use a perturbative many-body approach with realistic YN interaction to determine ﬁrst
the Λ self-energy in ﬁnite nuclei from which we can then obtain the single-Λ spectral function
and the Λ single-particle bound states for the different hypernuclei.

The manuscript is organized in the following way. In Sec. 2 we describe in detail the method
employed to determine the Λ spectral function in ﬁnite nuclei. Results for the Λ self-energy,
single-particle bound states, spectral function and disoccupation numbers in several hypernuclei
from 5
ΛPb are presented and discussed in Sec. 3. Finally, our main conclusions are
summarized in Sec. 4.

2. Evaluation of the single-Λ spectral function in ﬁnite nuclei

In this section we describe the calculation of the single-Λ spectral function in a hypernucleus.
The starting point of this calculation is a nuclear matter YN G-matrix evaluated in momentum
space at ﬁxed nuclear matter density, center-of-mass momentum and starting energy. This nu-
clear matter G-matrix is then used to construct a ﬁnite nucleus YN G-matrix from which we can
obtain the self-energy of the Λ in the Brueckner–Hartree–Fock (BHF) approximation, and the
corresponding spectral function, for different single-particle bound and scattering states of an
effective hyperon-nucleus potential in several hypernuclei. The calculation is done using some
of the realistic YN interactions of the J¨ulich [75, 76] and the Nijmegen [77, 78, 79] groups. The
description of our calculation is presented in the following after some few general remarks on
the evaluation of spectral functions.

2.1. General remarks

It is well known in quantum many-body theory that the propagation of a particle or a hole
with incoming (outgoing) momentum ~k (~k′) and energy ω that is added to a given N−particle
system is described by the single-particle Green’s function (or propagator) g(~k, ~k′, ω), which can
obtained by solving the Dyson equation [74]

g(~k, ~k′, ω) = g(0)(~k, ~k′, ω) +Z d~k′′Z d~k′′′g(0)(~k, ~k′′, ω)Σ(~k′′, ~k′′′, ω)g(~k′′′, ~k′, ω) ,

(1)

where g(0)(~k, ~k′, ω) is the free single-particle propagator and Σ(~k, ~k′, ω) is the proper self-energy.
Using a compact matrix notation, the solution of the Dyson equation can be formally writen as

g = (cid:0)1 − g(0)Σ(cid:1)−1

g(0) .

The spectral function S(~k, ω) can be directly obtained from the Lehmann representation of

the diagonal part of the propagator

where η is an inﬁnitesimal quantity, µ is the chemical potential, and Sh(~k, ω) and Sp(~k, ω) are the
hole and particle parts of the spectral function which give, respectively, the probability density
of removing or adding a particle to the ground state of a N−particle system, and ﬁnding the
resulting (N − 1)− or (N + 1)−system in an excited state of energy µ− ω (with ω < µ) or ω− µ
x ∓ iπδ(x) in Eq. (3),
(with ω > µ). Using the well known Plemelj integral relation 1
one easily gets

Writing Σ(~k, ~k′, ω) = Re Σ(~k, ~k′, ω) + iIm Σ(~k, ~k′, ω) in the solution of the Dyson equation,
taking the imaginary part of the propagator, and replacing it in Eqs. (4) and (5) one can express
Sh(~k, ω) and Sp(~k, ω) in terms of the diagonal part of the self-energy simply as

Sh(~k, ω) =

Note that in Eqs. (6), (7) and (8) the energy ω of the added particle or hole is measured with
respect to its rest mass .

Being Sh(~k, ω) and Sp(~k, ω) probability densities, they are non-negative by deﬁnition and

fulﬁl, for any value of the mometum ~k , the following sum rule

(9)

where the ﬁrst integral determines the momentum distribution, n(~k), and the second one, the
so-called depletion or disoccupation, d(~k).

After these general considerations let us now focus on the case of the Λ hyperon. As it is
said in the introduction, its spectral function is crucial for the calculation of the production cross
section of single-Λ hypernuclei. It is clear that in any of the production mechanisms of single-Λ
hypenuclei the Λ can only be added to the system and, therefore, the hole part of its spectral
function is zero. The Lehmann representation of the single-Λ propagator is then simply

gΛ(~k, ~k, ω) = Z ∞

Similarly, the sum rule expressed by Eq. (9) is simplyﬁed, reading in this case

(12)

which reﬂects the fact that is always possible to add a Λ to the system because the disoccupation
of any Λ-state of momentum ~k is 1.

2.2. Λ self-energy in ﬁnite nuclei

Our calculation of the Λ self-energy is based on a method that was originally developed to
study the properties of the nucleon [80] and the ∆ isobar [81] in ﬁnite nuclei, and was later
extended to study those of the Λ and Σ hyperons [48, 49, 50]. In the following we present a
general description of this method and refer the interested reader to these works, in particular to
Refs. [48, 49, 50], for speciﬁc details of the calculation.

The evaluation of the Λ self-energy in ﬁnite nucleus stars with the construction of all the
YN G-matrices which describe the in-medium interaction between a hyperon (Y= Λ, Σ) and a
nucleon in inﬁnite nuclear matter. The G-matrices are obtained by solving the coupled-channel
Bethe–Goldstone equation which schematically reads

hY ′N′|G|Y Ni = hY ′N′|V |Y Ni + XY ′′N ′′=ΛN,ΣN

hY ′N′|V |Y ′′N′′i

×

QY ′′N ′′

Ω − εY ′′ − εN ′′ + iηhY ′′N′′|G|Y Ni ,

(13)

where V is the bare YN interaction, QY ”N ” is the Pauli operator, that prevents the nucleon in the
intermediate state Y′′N′′ to be scattered below its Fermi momentum kFN , and Ω is the so-called
starting energy which is the sum of the non-relativistic single-particle energies of the interact-
ing hyperon and nucleon. We note here that the Bethe–Goldstone equation has been solved in
momentum space in the partial wave basis |Y Ni ≡ |KLqLSJJ T MTi where K(q) and L(L)
are respectively the center-of-mass (relative) momentum and orbital angular momentum, S is

5

the total spin, T and MT are the total isospin and its third component, and ~J = ~L + ~S. We
note also that when solving it, the so-called discontinuous prescription has been adopted, i.e.,
the single-particle energy of the hyperon (εY ′′) and the nucleon (εN ′′) in the intermediate state
Y′′N′′ is taken simply as the sum of the non-relativistic kinetic energy plus the mass of the cor-
responding baryon. Finally, we should mention that our calculation has been done at nuclear
matter density ρ = 0.17 fm−3, zero center-of-mass momentum and Ω = mN + mΛ − 80 MeV,
where −80 MeV is an averaged value for the sum of the single-particle mean ﬁelds of the nu-
cleon (UN (k = kFN ) ≈ −50 MeV) and the Λ (UΛ(k = 0) ≈ −30 MeV) at this density. The
dependence of our results on the values of the nuclear matter density ρ and the starting energy Ω
is weak as it is shown e.g., in Refs. [49, 50].

The ﬁnite nucleus YN G-matrix, GF N, can be obtained, in principle, by solving the Bethe–
Goldstone equation directly in the ﬁnite nucleus (see e.g., Refs. [82, 83]) which is formally
identical to Eq. (13), being the only differences the Pauli operator and the energy denominator
which in this case are the ones corresponding to the ﬁnite nucleus case. Alternatively, one can
ﬁnd GF N by relating it to the nuclear matter G-matrix already obtained. Eliminating the bare
interaction V in both ﬁnite nucleus and nuclear matter Bethe–Goldstone equations, GF N can be
written in terms of G through the following integral equation, written in a simplyﬁed form as

GF N = G + G(cid:20)QF N
= G + G(cid:20)QF N

EF N −

EF N −

Q

E(cid:21) G(cid:20)QF N

EF N −

Q

E(cid:21) G + · · · ,

(14)

where the difference QF N /EF N − Q/E (being QF N, EF N, Q and E the corresponding ﬁnite
nucleus and nuclear matter Pauli operators and energy denominators) accounts for the relevant
intermediate particle-particle states. This difference has been shown to be quite small [48, 49, 50,
80, 81] and, therefore, in all practical calculations GF N can be well approximated by truncating
the expansion (14) up second order in the nuclear matter G-matrix. Therefore, we have

GF N ≃ G + G(cid:20)QF N

EF N −

Q

E(cid:21) G .

(15)

Using now GF N as an effective YN interaction, we can calculate the ﬁnite nucleus Λ self-
enegy in the BHF approximation (see diagram (a) of Fig. 1). According to Eq. (15) this approx-
imation can be split into the sum of two contributions: the one of diagram (b), which represents
the ﬁrst-order term on the right-hand side of Eq. (15), and that of diagram (c), which stands for
the so-called two-particle-one-hole (2p1h) correction. In the following we show the explicit ex-
pressions of both contributions without going into many details of their derivation which can be
found in Refs. [48, 49, 50].

where the incoming (outgoing) Λ and the nucleon hole are respectively taken as plane wave and
harmonic oscillator states with quantum numbers kΛ(k′Λ)lΛjΛ and nhlhjhtzh. The total angular
momentum of the Λ nucleon hole pair is ~J = ~jΛ + ~jh in the laboratory frame. Note that in the
above expression and in the following ones neither the z-component of the Λ isospin tzΛ = 0 nor
its total spin and that of the nucleons is shown explicitly.

The contribution of diagram (c) is the sum of two terms. The ﬁrst of them is the term
G (QF N /EF N ) G in Eq. (15) which gives rise to an imaginary part in the Λ self-energy which
depends explicitly on the energy of the hyperon and reads

where ω is the energy of the Λ measured with respect to its rest mass. The quantum numbers
K,L, q, L, S, J,J , T and MT have been deﬁned before, and the energies of the nucleon hole
states εh have been taken equal to the experimental single-particle ones of the nuclei studied.
One can see from the delta function that W2p1h is different from zero only for positive values of
ω. The contribution of this term to the real part of the Λ self-energy can be obtained through the

The second contribution of diagram (c) is that of the term G (Q/E) G in Eq. (15). This term
gives also a real and energy-independent contribution to the Λ self-energy, and avoids double
counting over intermediate Y′N states that are already contained in the nuclear matter G-matrix
of the contribution of diagram (b). It reads

Further details on the evaluation of the Λ self-energy, such as the transformation from the
basis |(kΛlΛjΛ)(nhlhjhtzh)J i to the partial wave one |KLqLSJJ T MTi used to solve Eq. (13),
or the orthogonalization procedure of the occupied nucleon states with the distorted plane wave
associated with the nucleon in the intermediate state of diagram (c), can be found in Refs. [48,
49, 50, 80, 81].

Summarizing, the BHF approximation of the self-energy of a Λ with incoming (outgoing)

momentum kΛ(k′Λ), orbital angular momentum lΛ, and total angular momentum jΛ is given by

ΣBHF (kΛ, k′Λ, lΛ, jΛ, ω) = V(kΛ, k′Λ, lΛ, jΛ, ω) + iW(kΛ, k′Λ, lΛ, jΛ, ω) ,

(20)

V(kΛ, k′Λ, lΛ, jΛ, ω) = V1(kΛ, k′Λ, lΛ, jΛ) + V (1)
and

2p1h(kΛ, k′Λ, lΛ, jΛ) (21)

W(kΛ, k′Λ, lΛ, jΛ, ω) = W2p1h(kΛ, k′Λ, lΛ, jΛ, ω) .

(22)

2.3. Λ spectral function

In any production mechanism of single-Λ hypernuclei, a Λ with quantum numbers kΛlΛjΛ
can be formed either in a scattering or in a bound state. Therefore, its spectral function is the
sum of a continuum and a discrete contribution

SpΛ(kΛ, lΛ, jΛ, ω) = Sc

pΛ(kΛ, lΛ, jΛ, ω) + Sd

pΛ(kΛ, lΛ, jΛ, ω) ,

(23)

8

which give, respectively, the probability density of adding the Λ in the scattering or the bound
state of the corresponding hyperon-nucleus potential.

The continuum contribution is different from zero only for ω ≥ 0 (see Eq. (17)) and it can be

obtained by using the self-energy of Eq. (20) in Eq. (7). It simply reads

(24)
The discrete contribution is a weighted delta function located at the energy corresponding to
the Λ bound state. To calculate it, we need ﬁrst to determine this state. This can be done by
using the real part of the Λ self-energy as an effective single-particle hyperon-nucleus potential
in the Schr¨odinger equation. Following the procedure outlined in Refs. [48, 49, 50, 80, 81], we
solve it by diagonalizing the corresponding single-particle Hamiltonian in a complete and or-
thonormal set of regular basis functions within a spherical box of radius Rbox given in coordinate
representation by

ΦnlΛjΛmjΛ (~r) = h~r|knlΛjΛmjΛi = NnlΛ jlΛ(knr)ψlΛjΛmjΛ (θ, φ) ,

To guarantee the independence of the results on Rbox, its value should be larger than the
radius of the nucleus considered. Typically Rbox is chosen around 20 fm or larger. The resulting
eigenvalue problem reads

and ΨnlΛjΛmjΛ ≡ hknlΛjΛmjΛ|Ψi denotes the projection of the state |Ψi on the basis |knlΛjΛmΛi.
Note that a self-consistent procedure is required for each eigenvalue, i.e., the Λ self-energy should
be evaluated at each step of the iterative process at the energy of the resulting eigenvalue until
convergence is achieved.

Once the solution of the Schr¨odinger equation is found we can ﬁnally obtain the contribution

3. Results

In this section we present our results for the self-energy, single-particle bound states and the
spectral function of a Λ in 5
ΛPb. The results have been obtained
using some of the realistic J¨ulich and Nijmegen YN interactions; namely, the models J¨ulich B
(JB) [75] and J¨ulich 04 (J04) [76], and the Nijmegen soft-core models NSC89 [77] and NSC97a-
f [78, 79]. Results for the disoccupation of Λ bound and scattering states are also presented and
discussed at the end of the section.

for 209

ΛPb obtained with the NSC89 model. The energy is measured with respect to the Λ rest mass.

3.1. Λ self-energy

We start by showing in Fig. 2 the energy dependence of the real V and imaginary W part (see
Eqs. (21) and (22)) of the self-enegy of a Λ with momentum 300 MeV/c, lΛ = 0 and jΛ = 1/2,
for the six hypernuclei considered. Results are presented for all the YN interactions mentioned
above. As it is seen in the ﬁgure, in general, W is, in absolute value, larger in the Nijmegen
models than in the J¨ulich ones. Consequently, the dispersion relation of Eq. (18) leads in the
case of the Nijmegen models to a stronger energy dependence of V. We observe that W is only
different from zero for ω > 0, as it was said before, and that it is always negative, even for
energies larger than those shown in the ﬁgure. Moreover, due to phase space restrictions, W
behaves almost quadratically for energies close to ω = 0 [84, 85]

W(kΛ, k′Λ, lΛ, jΛ, ω) ∼ c ω2,

ω −→ 0+ .

(32)

The energy dependence of V can be understood from the dispersion relation (18). Since W
is different from zero only for ω > 0 and it is negative, this dispersion relation implies that V
will be attractive for ω < 0. This attraction increases up to a given positive value of ω and then it

decreases, eventually turning into repulsion at large energies. Note that V is more attractive for
the heavier hypernuclei because their densities are larger.
All these features can be also observed in Fig. 3 where, for completeness, we show the
energy dependence of V and W of a Λ in the s, p, d, f and g partial waves for 209
ΛPb. The results
are shown for the NSC89 model and two momenta of the hyperon: 300 and 500 MeV/c. Note
that the dependence of both V and W on the orbital (lΛ) and total (jΛ) angular momentum of the
Λ is rather weak. Note also that, as expected, the attraction of V is clearly larger for the smaller
momentum.

a single-particle state. Since experimental data for those hypernuclei do not always exist, we
show for comparison the closest representative hypernuclei for which experimental information
is available. Experimental data have been taken from Refs. [86, 87, 88]. We note, however, that
the differences between the calculated and the experimental values should not be associated only
to this fact but mainly to the approximations used in the calculation or to the uncertainties of the
interactions employed.

In general the agreement with experimental data is qualitatively good for most of the models
except for the J04 one, which for all hypernuclei predicts an unrealistic overbinding of the Λ in all
the single-particle states. For this reason, in the following we will not present further results for
this model. Note that the results for 91
ΛPb appear clearly overbound also for the other
models, specially for the NSC97a-f ones. This overbinding is mainly due to two reasons. The ﬁrst
one is that the NSC97a-f models are too much attractive, predicting a Λ single-particle potential
in symmetric nuclear matter of about −40 MeV, in comparison with the value of around −30
MeV extrapolated from hypernuclear data [89]. The second one is the fact that the distortion of
the plane wave associated with the nucleon in the intermediate state of Fig. 1c, which is needed

to guarantee its orthogonalization with the nucleon hole state (see e.g., Ref. [80] for a detail
description), has been done in an approximate way. In addition, the orthogonalization procedure
has been optimized only for the case of 17
ΛO. Note ﬁnally that the splitting of the p−, d−, f−
and g−wave states is of the order of few tenths of MeV in all cases due to the small spin-orbit
strength of the YN interaction.
For completeness we plot in Figs. 4 and 5 the radial wave function of the Λ in the different
bound states of the six hypernuclei considered. The results are shown only for the JB, NSC89,
NSC97a and NSC97f YN interactions. Results for the NSC97b-e models are not shown because
their difference with respect to those of the NSC97a and NSC97f is smaller than ∼ 10%. There-
fore, from now on we will consider the NSC97a and NSC97f models together with the NSC89
one as representative of the Nijmegen Soft Core YN interaction.

The probability of ﬁnding the Λ at the center of the hypernucleus is given by |Ψs1/2(r = 0)|2.
As it can bee seen in Figs. 4 and 5, going from light to heavy hypernuclei the wave function of the
s1/2 state becomes more and more spread due to the larger extension of the nuclear density over
which the Λ hyperon wants to be distributed and, therefore, this probability decreases. Only the

ΛHe falls out of this pattern due to the fact that the energy of the bound state
light hypernucleus 5
s1/2 is very small in this case, therefore, resulting in a very extended wave function, specially
for the NSC89 model. Note now from Tab. 1 that, in fact, the NSC89 model predicts always
the larger single-particle energies which result in the larger radii for all the bound Λ states and,
therefore, in more extended wave functions than those predicted by the other models which are
more localized. This is illustrated in particular for the s1/2 state in Tab. 2, where we show its
root-mean-square radius for the different hypernuclei. Finally, we would like to conclude this
discussion by noticing that, due to the scale of the ﬁgures, the small spin-orbit splitting of the
p−, d−, f− and g−wave states cannot be resolved in the corresponding wave functions.
3.3. Λ spectral function

In Fig. 6 we show the energy dependence of the continuum (solid lines) and discrete (dashed
lines) contributions of the spectral function of a Λ with momentum 400 MeV/c, lΛ = 0 and
jΛ = 1/2 for all the hypernuclei considered. The results have been obtained with the JB, NSC89,
NSC97a and NSC97f YN interactions. The discrete contribution, as it was said at the end of Sec.
2, is a delta function with a strength given by Eq. (29), which is located at the energy of the
single-particle s1/2 bound state of the corresponding hypernuclei (see Tab. 1). On the other hand,
the strength of the continuum contribution is spread over all positive energies, and shows the well
known quasi-particle peak at the value of the quasi-particle energy εlΛjΛ
qp (kΛ), which is deﬁned
through the following transcendental equation

εlΛjΛ
qp (kΛ) =

2k2
Λ
2mΛ

+ V(kΛ, kΛ, lΛ, jΛ, εlΛjΛ

qp (kΛ)) .

(33)

The quasi-particle peak is a reminiscence of the delta function structure of the spectral func-
tion of a non-interacting Λ. Note that this delta function should not be confused with that of the
discrete contribution of the spectral function just described. The correlations between the Λ and
the nucleons transform the simple delta function structure of the non-interacting case into the
more complex one shown by the continuous lines of Fig. 6. They shift the position of the delta
from its location at the kinetic energy of the Λ towards the value of εlΛjΛ
qp (kΛ), give it a width,
and lower its strength which is distributed over all positive energies.

ΛHe to 209

An estimation of the role played by the Λ-nucleon correlations can be obtained from the
measurement of the spectral strength that is located below the quasi-particle peak. This is given
by the so-called Z−factor, which is deﬁned in a way similar to the spectroscopic one given in
Eq. (30)

The smaller the value of ZlΛjΛ(kΛ) is, the more important are the correlations of the system. We
show in Tab. 3 the value of ZlΛjΛ(kΛ) for three values of the momentum of a Λ with lΛ = 0
and jΛ = 1/2. The corresponding value of εlΛjΛ
qp (kΛ) is also given. The results are shown, as
before, for the JB, NSC89, NSC97a and NSC97f models. As it is seen, the value of ZlΛjΛ(kΛ)
decreases when one moves from light to heavier hypernuclei. This simply reﬂects the fact that
Λ-nucleon correlations becomes more and more important when the density of the nuclear core
increases (see Fig. 2). The momentum dependence of ZlΛjΛ(kΛ) can be easily understand from
the Λ self-energy. By looking at Fig. 3, it is clear that the energy dependence of the real part
of the Λ self-energy is stronger for the smaller values of the momentum. Since the derivative of

V is negative at the quasi-particle energy, and larger in absolute value for the smaller momenta,
the Z-factor decreases when decreasing the momentum of the Λ, as it is seem in the table. We
note, however, that the Z-factor is, in general, relatively large. This is in agreement with the fact,
already mentioned in the introduction, that the Λ keeps its identity inside the nucleus, and that is
less correlated than the nucleons for which the Z-factor is smaller. This was already observed in
nuclear matter by Robertson and Dickhoff in Refs. [72, 73].
We ﬁnish this part of the section by showing in Fig. 7 a weigthed sum of the Λ spectral

function deﬁned as

S(kΛ, ω) = XlΛjΛ

(2jΛ + 1)SpΛ(kΛ, lΛ, jΛ, ω) .

(35)

The results have been obtained with the NSC97f model, and are given for all the hypernuclei and
three momenta of the Λ. As in Fig. 6, solid and dashed lines show the continuum and discrete
contributions. The ﬁgure presents the same general features described before and, therefore,
there is no need to discuss them again. Note simply that the discrete contribution of S(kΛ, ω) is
a set of weigthed delta functions located at the energies of the corresponding bound states (see
Tab. 1), and that the quasi-particle peak of the continuum, as it is well known, moves towards
larger energies when the momentum of the Λ increases (see also the last column of Tab. 3).

3.4. Disoccupation number

To ﬁnish this section, we show in Figs. 8 and 9, respectively, the disocupation of the s1/2 state
in the different hypernuclei, and that of the s−, p−, d−, f− and g−wave ones in 209
ΛPb, predicted
by the JB and the NSC97f models. In both ﬁgures, the discrete (solid lines) and continuum
(dashed lines) contributions are shown separately. It is clear from Eqs. (12) and (23) that the sum
of both contributions is 1. In general, as it has been already said, a Λ with quantum numbers
kΛlΛjΛ can be always be added to the nucleus, either in a bound state with probability

dd(kΛ, lΛ, jΛ) = Z ∞

or in a scattering one with probability

(37)

Intuitively, one expects that if the momentum kΛ is large, then the Λ can easily escape and,
therefore, the probability of binding it in the nucleus should be quite small. This feature is

clearly shown in both ﬁgures, where we can observe that, in fact, the discrete contribution to the
disoccupation of a given lΛjΛ state is always much smaller than the continuum one being, in fact,
almost negligible for large values of the momentum of the Λ. This indicates that in hypernuclear
production reactions the Λ hyperon is formed mostly in a quasi-free state. We note ﬁnally that
the oscillation behaviour of dd(kΛ, lΛ, jΛ) is simply due to the zeros of the projection coefﬁcient
hkΛlΛjΛ|Ψi (see Eq. (29)), that in the logarithmic scale of the plot appear as singularities.
4. Summary and conclusions

In this work we have determined the single-particle spectral function of the Λ hyperon in
several hypernuclei. To such end, we have obtained ﬁrst the corresponding Λ self-energy using
a perturbative many-body approach with some of the realistic YN interactions of the J¨ulich [75,
76] and the Nijmegen [77, 78, 79] groups. The calculation started with the construction of a
nuclear matter YN G-matrix that was used to build a ﬁnite nucleus one through a perturbative
expansion that is truncated at second order. This ﬁnite nuclei YN G-matrix was then employed
to calculate the Λ self-energy. From it we obtained ﬁnally the Λ spectral function and the binding
energies, wave functions and disoccupation numbers of different single-particle states for various

ΛHe to 209

ΛPb.

We showed that the Nijmegen models predict an imaginary part of the Λ self-energy larger
than that obtained with the J¨ulich ones, which results in a stronger energy dependence of its real
part. The dependence of the Λ self-energy on the orbital (lΛ) and total (jΛ) angular momentum
of the Λ was found to be quite small.

Using the real part of the Λ self-energy as an effective hyperon-nucleus potential in the
Schr¨odinger equation, we obtained the Λ single-particle bound states in the several hypernu-
clei considered. Our results compared rather well with the experimental data for all the models
except for the J04, which predicted an unrealistic overbinding of all the Λ single-particle orbits.
The small spin-orbit splitting of the p−, d−, f− and g−wave states was conﬁrmed.
The discrete and the continuum contributions of the single-Λ spectral function were then ob-
tained from the Λ self-energy. Their appearance was found to be qualitatively similar to that of
the nucleons. We showed that the discrete contribution is a weigthed delta function located at the
energy of the corresponding single-Λ bound state, and that the strength of the continuum one is
spread over all positive energies showing the well known quasi-particle peak at the correspond-
ing energy. The so-called Z factor, that measures the importance of the correlations, was also
calculated for the s1/2 state. Our results showed that the value of Z was relatively large, indi-

20

cating that the Λ is less correlated than the nucleons, in agreement with the idea that it mantains
its identity inside the nucleus, and with the results of a previous study of the Λ correlations in
inﬁnite nuclear matter [72, 73].

Finally, by integrating the Λ spectral function over the energy, we obtained the disoccupa-
tion numbers of different single-particle states for the various hypernuclei. Our results showed
that the discrete contribution to the disoccupation numbers is always much more smaller than
the continuum one, indicating that in hypernuclear production reactions the Λ hyperon is formed
mostly in a quasi-free state. To ﬁnish, we would like to say that scattering reactions, such as
the high precision (e, e′K +) ones carried out at JLAB and MAMI-C, can provide valuable infor-
mation on the discoccupation of Λ single-particle bound states needed to have a more complete
description of the properties of the Λ hyperon in nuclear systems.
