All-Dielectric Nanophotonic Structures:
Exploring the Magnetic Component of Light

Ben Hopkins, Andrey E. Miroshnichenko, and Yuri S. Kivshar

Abstract. We discuss the physics of nanophotonic structures composed of high-
index dielectric nanoparticles that each support Mie-type electric and magnetic
dipole resonances. Several basic approaches are introduced for analytical and nu-
merical study of the collective optical response from such all-dielectric nanophotonic
structures. We also provide comparison on the optical properties of all-dielectric
structures with that of corresponding plasmonic structures, and review recent exper-
imental demonstrations of Fano resonances in all-dielectric nanoparticle oligomers.

9.1 Introduction

Recent progress in nanophotonics is often associated with the study of plas-
monic structures that have enabled enhanced near-ﬁeld eﬀects at the nanoscale
and control over far-ﬁeld scattering. However, a new branch of nanophotonics
has emerged through the manipulation of strong optically-induced Mie-type
electric and magnetic resonances in dielectric and semiconductor nanoparti-
cles with high refractive index. High-index resonant nanoparticles oﬀer many
advantages over their plasmonic counterparts in terms of reduced dissipative
losses, low heating, and the resonant enhancement of both electric and mag-
netic ﬁelds [1–3]. The coexistence of electric and magnetic resonances has
enabled eﬀective realization of Kerker’s conditions [4] for reﬂectionless scat-
tering by using individual dielectric nanoparticles [5–8]. This development
has subsequently led to various new phenomena for manipulation of direc-
tional light scattering [9–11] and optical nano-antenna applications [12–14].
This Chapter summarizes several basic numerical approaches applied to the
analysis of all-dielectric nanophotonic structures, while also comparing our
results with those of plasmonic structures, and their functionalities. Within
this scope, one particular area has garnered signiﬁcant attention and is explic-
itly considered here: the study of Fano resonances in nanoparticle oligomers

and cluster structures [15, 16]. While the aforementioned directionality of sin-
gle dielectric nanoparticles can be considered as an eﬀect of interference in
the scattering along particular directions, Fano resonances correspond to a
resonant interference in the total scattering of an object. Yet, these two phe-
nomena will become interdependent if an all-dielectric nanoparticle oligomer
were to exhibit Fano resonances; a situation that presents a whole new layer
to directional scattering phenomena at the nanoscale. In this regard, Fano in-
terference has been predominantly described for speciﬁc plasmonic oligomers,
where a directly-excited super-radiant mode interferes destructively with an
indirectly-excited “dark mode” (or trapped mode). Yet, it was predicted that
Fano resonances should also occur in all-dielectric symmetric oligomers [17]
despite the absence of plasmon hybridization between nanoparticles. As is de-
termined from the formal treatment presented herein, there exists a common
mechanism underlying the physics of Fano resonances in both plasmonic and
all-dielectric oligomers. The observed Fano lineshapes are attributed to the
fact that the eigenmodes of oligomers are not orthogonal and that, therefore,
they can interfere with each other. This also establishes why Fano resonances
can be realized in completely symmetric oligomers excited by normal incidence
plane waves, without involving additional complexity into the system.

9.2 Modeling All-Dielectric Nanostructures

9.2.1 Maxwell’s Equations for Nanophotonics

Physically, electromagnetic ﬁelds describe retarded forces between charges.
Electric and magnetic ﬁelds are deﬁned as heralds of linear and rotational force
on charges; a basis that has been historically necessary, or at least convenient,
because it corresponds to the way natural materials respond. Indeed, atoms
and other neutral compositions of charged matter dominantly behave as per
electric and magnetic dipoles; oscillating charges and circulating currents. Ma-
terial then arises when deﬁning regions of closely packed electric and magnetic
dipoles with homogenized volumes of electric and magnetic dipole densities,
two densities which we refer to as permittivity and permeability. Homogeniza-
tion, as such, inherently corresponds to material as found in nature. However,
this macroscopic description doesn’t align with the advent of metamaterials,
nanoantennas, and complex structured media generally. Macroscopic assem-
blies of subwavelength meta-atoms need not respond to ﬁelds as per linear or
rotational movement of charge; the constituent point sources in such a homog-
enized material are not necessarily electric or magnetic dipoles. Even compact
arrangements of coupled dipolar nanoparticles can collectively exhibit higher-
order optical behavior on a subwavelength scale [18]. Therefore, underlying the
rapid development of complex nanophotonic structures is a need to re-evaluate
how we understand the optical properties of complex structured objects and
media. The particular area of investigation that now demands a detailed un-
derstanding on the limits of complex optical materials is the development of

all-dielectric nanostructures. This is ultimately because simple nanostructures
made from a high-index dielectric material are able to exhibit both electric
and magnetic response [1,3], including magnetic resonances that are of similar
magnitude or even stronger than the electric dipole resonances of plasmonic
nanoparticles, as is seen in Figure 9.1. This ﬁgure also demonstrates how the
reduced material loss of silicon leads to less damping in the resonances of
silicon nanoparticles, thereby producing higher Q-factors when compared to
plasmonic counterparts.

Fig. 9.1. Comparison of the scattering cross-sections of gold, silver and silicon
nanoparticles of the same geometrical sizes: (a) diameter 50 nm, and (b) diameter
150 nm. These results demonstrate that in addition to a new type of resonances
dielectric particles scatter light more eﬃciently than plasmonic ones for larger sizes.
Reproduced after A. I. Kuznetsov [19].

The seemingly small change of having both electric and magnetic dipole
resonances can have dramatic eﬀects on the scattering behavior of single
nanostructures [4, 20, 21], but also that of collective nanoparticle clusters
[22, 23] and arrays [24–26]. Generalization of the electric and magnetic single
particle response for arbitrary, high refractive index, dielectric materials also
translates such behavior across a large spectrum, owing to the scaling proper-
ties of the resonances with refractive index and nanoparticle size, as discussed
in Ref. [3]. In this chapter, we address the challenge of understanding com-
plex dielectric nanostructures ﬁrstly in terms of free currents and polarization
currents because they are the underlying physical sources of ﬁelds within any
arbitrary system, and thereby encapsulate its complete optical characteris-
tics. Secondly, we present the dipole model as a practical simpliﬁcation that
allows direct investigation of the dominant resonances of compact nanoparti-
cle systems. This two-model approach is used for understanding the physics of
nanoparticle cluster geometries consisting high-index dielectric nanoparticles,
and reconciling the simultaneous interplay of electric and magnetic ﬁelds in
these scattering systems. In doing so, we aim to establish a platform on which
nanoscale designs can be reliably manipulated to capitalize on the interaction
between dielectric nanoparticles and the magnetic ﬁeld in light.

9.2.2 Radiation by Internal Current Distributions

We begin our scattering analysis of linear optical systems by acknowledging
that any arbitrary time-varying electric and magnetic ﬁelds can be described
as a distribution of harmonic ﬁelds in a Fourier series representation. Further-
more, for monochromatic response, there is no particular need to recognize
the distinction between free current and polarization current, given conduc-
tivity ¯σ and susceptibility ¯χ can be incorporated into an eﬀective permittivity
¯ that relates electric ﬁeld E to a total electric current J.

¯ ≡ ( ¯χ + 1)0 − ¯σ
iω

⇒ J(r)eiωt = −iω [¯(r) − 0] E(r)eiωt .

(9.1)

There is also the simpliﬁcation that most optical materials have a negligible
diﬀerence in permeability compared to their respective background medium,
allowing us to neglect the radiation from any magnetization current. As such,
the ﬁeld Es scattered from an arbitrary structure can be described by radiation
from a distribution of electric current, and can be expressed in terms of dyadic
Green’s functions [27].

where k is the wavenumber, ω is the angular frequency, 0 and µ0 are the

where R = |r − r(cid:48)|, the P.V. implies a principal value exclusion of r(cid:48) = r
when performing the integration in Equation 9.4, and ¯L is the source dyadic
necessary to account for the shape of this exclusion [27]. Notably, we can
then use this expression for the scattered ﬁeld to ﬁnd the current induced
by a external electric ﬁeld E0. In particular, using Equation 9.1, the current
can found from the total interal ﬁeld E = E0 + Es, producing the following
relation between the induced ﬁeld and the external ﬁeld:

−iω[¯(r) − 0] E0(r) =J(r) − k2

[¯(r) − 0]

¯G0(r, r(cid:48))J(r(cid:48)) dr(cid:48)3 .

(9.4)

As such, Equation 9.4 and Equation 9.2 will completely describe the cur-
rents induced and ﬁelds radiated, respectively, by any arbitrary ﬁnite struc-
ture in the absence of magnetization. This is a comprehensive description
of general scattering systems, and is therefore useful for ﬁnding broad ana-
lytical conclusions as a result of geometry. For instance, using this current

model, it has previously been shown that there is an unexpected degener-
acy between oppositely-handed resonances when discrete rotational symme-
try is imposed [28]. Below, we will use it to discuss the relation between
far-ﬁeld interference features and the nonorthogonality of eigenmodes. It is,
however, highly nontrivial to obtain a general, excitation-independent, solu-
tion for Equation 9.4 for even very simple geometries, plainly because the
model inherently describes the complete dynamics of a given object’s scat-
tering, encapsulating all resonances, irrespective of their magnitude. There is
at least one existing numerical approach for calculating the general scattering
properties of an object from the resonances of surface current distributions, be-
ing the method of Powell [29] implemented through the OpenModes software,
which deals with complexity by searching only for a subset of the complex
frequency resonances. Here, however, we will focus on arrangements of simple
nanoparticles, so-called oligomers, which utilize the coupling between simple
nanoparticles, rather than nanoparticle geometry, to produce complex optical
features such as Fano resonances [22, 30] and near-ﬁeld control [31, 32]. For
these nanoparticle oligomers, we are able to restrict our analysis to the optical
properties of the collective geometry by only considering the dominant opti-
cal response of the individual nanoparticles. In particular, the model that will
be used extensively throughout the remainder of this chapter is to consider
only the dipole-order responses of individual nanoparticles. As we will show,
this approach suﬀers from only minor limitations in accuracy while oﬀering
dramatic simpliﬁcations in modal analysis.

9.2.3 Dipole Models

The constituent nanoparticles of oligomers are, in general, of simple geome-
try and subwavelength in size, which implies that their individual optical re-
sponses can be entirely described in terms of resonant dipole moments [1, 33].
We will begin in the simpler case of plasmonic nanoparticles, where the in-
dividual nanoparticle response is dominantly an electric dipole, and we can
therefore use the dipole approximation [34] to describe the optical properties
of the oligomer. In particular, each nanoparticle’s electric dipole moment (pi)
is related to the externally-applied electric ﬁeld (E0) as:

pi = α(i)

E 0E0(ri) + α(i)

¯G0(ri, rj) · pj .

(9.5)

Here, αE,i is the electric dipole polarizability of the ith particle and we can
write the eﬀect of ¯G0 more explicitly as:

where n is the unit vector pointing from r to r(cid:48). The expression in Equation 9.5
forms a matrix equation of rank 3N , where N is the number of dipoles, and
it can be solved for an arbitrary excitation as per an ordinary matrix equa-
tion. In Figure 9.2a, we present the validity of this model for a symmetric
trimer arrangement of gold nanospheres, where the electric dipole polarizabil-
ities of the nanospheres are calculated through a1 scattering coeﬃcients from
Mie theory [35, 36], c.f. Equation 9.7. Even with very small gaps between
the spheres, the dipole model oﬀers an accurate prediction of the trimer’s
response, with the exception of that coming from the single particle electric
quadrupole response. However, the situation becomes notably diﬀerent when

we utilize high-index dielectric nanoparticles. Simple dielectric nanospheres
will also exhibit a magnetic dipole resonance in addition to an electric dipole
resonance. Indeed we can express the electric and magnetic dipole polarizabil-
ities in terms of the a1 and b1 scattering coeﬃcients, which are known from
Mie theory for the case of spheres [35, 36].

Notably, Equation 9.5 is the discrete equivalent to the continuous current dis-
tribution model in Equation 9.4, and in Equation 9.8 it is extended to account
for magnetization currents in addition to polarization currents. In other words,
the magnetic dipoles introduced into Equation 9.8 behave as per sources of
magnetization current. This description of circulating current in a nanoparti-
cle is, at least macroscopically, indistinguishable to a source of true magneti-
zation that derives from material permeability. Indeed, this can be understood
due to the fact that, regarding atoms in natural materials, permeability was
originally deﬁned to describe circulating currents. The latter being analogous
to circulating polarization current as per Equation 9.1, and a high-index di-
electric nanoparticle remains smaller than the resonant wavelength, even if
much larger than either atoms or molecules. As such, dielectric nanoparticles
allow a straightforward avenue to access eﬀective material properties with
both permittivity and permeability. However, we previously mentioned that
a key advantage of nanostructures is to go beyond conventional materials. In
this regard, we simply need to acknowledge that a single nanoparticle will
rarely act in isolation; it radiates and couples with other nearby nanoparticles
to form collective modes, and the individual nanoparticles no longer respond
proportionally to the applied electric and magnetic ﬁelds as per permittivity
and permeability. In the next section we investigate such collective optical
responses rigorously by presenting an eigenmode approach for describing the
optical responses of coupled nanoparticle scattering systems.

9.3 Eigenmodes of Nanoparticle Oligomers

9.3.1 Resonances, Polarizability, and Eigenmodes

One of the most important properties of nanoscale structures is their reso-
nant response. Thus, it is important to understand conditions of the reso-
nance in order to tailor it toward some given application, be it electric or
magnetic ﬁeld localization, directionality, chiral resonances, or any number
of other potential applications. In this regard, the majority of quantitative
approaches to characterize a resonance rely on a multipolar decomposition
of a given resonance. There are two approaches to get such a multipolar de-
composition: project the scattered ﬁeld onto spherical harmonics to obtain a
spherical multipole decompositions, or project the internal current and charge
distributions onto Cartesian multipoles (and their various correction factors)
to obtain a Cartesian multipole decomposition [37–39]. Such decompositions
can then be used to deﬁne polarizability, or impedances generally, for each
multipolar mode [40]. However, these polarizabilities, and the multipolar de-
compositions more generally, are inherently dependent on the choice of origin
when performing the decomposition. As such, they ultimately remain only a
non-unique basis for the scattering responses, where any given multipole is not
necessarily fully-representative of the given resonance. This can, for instance,
lead to a large number of multipoles being necessary to describe a single res-
onance. Furthermore, while there is an intuitive choice of origin for simple
nanostructures, it can be much less obvious for complex nanostructures or ar-
rangements of nanoparticles, including nanoparticle oligomers. Equivalently,
the multipole decomposition may simply not align well with the resonances of
a given object. These same issues can impact other existing analytical tools
in nanophotonics, such as the T -matrix method, because it relies on the same
spherical multipole decomposition of scattered ﬁelds. Indeed, to understand
the resonances of a system more fundamentally, and in a way that is indepen-
dent to the choice of origin, we can instead consider the eigenmodes of the
electric current system in the presence of a driving ﬁeld. Moreover, Eq. 9.4
has an associated eigenmode equation, where an eigenmode |v(cid:105) has a current
distribution Jv and eigenvalue λv that satisﬁes:

(cid:90)

0

¯G0(r, r(cid:48))Jv(r(cid:48)) dr

(cid:48)3 .

(9.10)

These eigenvalues and eigenmodes represent an origin-independent basis of
polarizabilities or impedances, and the associated stable current distributions,
respectively. Furthermore, at any single wavelength, the set of eigenmodes rep-
resents the only basis for the optical response where each basis vector repre-
sents a current distribution that is subject to energy conservation in isolation.
In a mathematical sense, the real component of the eigenvalue must be greater
than zero to satisfy passivity, or must be less than zero to be active (refer to
Equation 9.18), where active means inputting net energy into the system and

9 All-dielectric Nanophotonic Structures

9

passive simply refers to being not active. The ﬁnal characteristic to recognize
is that the complex frequency where an eigenvalue becomes zero corresponds
to a self-sustaining current distribution, otherwise known as a resonance of
the system. In fact, given the eigenmodes will almost always form a complete
and linearly-independent basis, every such self-sustaining resonance must be
associated with at least one zero eigenvalue. In summary, the eigenmode ap-
proach obtains both the complete set of underlying resonances at complex
frequencies, and the only complete set of passive basis vectors at real fre-
quencies, while further connecting these two physical attributes together in
a consistent and origin-independent modal framework. A basis of eigenmodes
thereby provides both mathematical and physical insight into the underlying
optical response of any ﬁnite scattering system. As we will address in the next
section, there is an added signiﬁcance that the current model here contains
loss and is thereby generally non-Hermitian, meaning eigenmodes need not be
orthogonal. However, the speciﬁc excitation of each eigenmode in the current
model can still be found through the impact of Lorentz Reciprocity on the
eigenmodes of any arbitrary system. Moreover, Lorentz Reciprocity requires
that the dyadic Green’s function and permittivity tensor be symmetric, albeit
complex and not necessarily Hermitian.

(9.11)

Due to this symmetry, it is possible to write the overall operator of the
eigenvalue equation (Eq. 9.10) as a matrix in the normal form shown by
Gantmacher [41]. As a result, nondegenerate eigenmodes are orthogonal under
unconjugated projections [42]

Jv(r) · Jw(r) dr3 = 0 , when λv (cid:54)= λw .

(9.12)

(cid:90)

V

This pseudo-orthogonality of eigenmodes makes the excitation of any eigen-
mode determined through unconjugated dot products between the eigenmode
and a driving ﬁeld, analogous to the more familiar use of true complex projec-
tions when ﬁnding the excitation of orthogonal eigenmodes. As such, despite
eigenmodes being nonorthogonal, any given eigenmode’s excitation is not de-
pendent on the excitations of other eigenmodes; it is determined entirely by
the given eigenmode’s current distribution and the driving ﬁeld. Turning now
to our consideration of nanoparticle oligomer, this conclusion carries over to
the eigenmodes of systems made from purely electric dipoles. An eigenmode
|v(cid:105) having electric dipoles pv will satisfy Eq. 9.5 as:

This relationship between this dipole model and the current distribution
model is not surprising given polarization and current are related as per Equa-
tion 9.1, where free currents are described in terms of polarization current.

10

B. Hopkins, A. E. Miroshnichenko, Y. S. Kivshar

Indeed, beyond accounting for the factor of iω and the source dyadic ¯L, the
dipole model is the same as the current model when the current distribution
is described by a countable set of Dirac delta functions.

However, when introducing magnetic dipoles, we are describing the mag-
netic response of dielectric nanoparticles as magnetization. Because of this,
eigenmodes will be simultaneously constructed of both polarization and mag-
netization, where each has diﬀerent units. To address this diﬀerence of units,
an initial approach was to separate the eigenmodes of electric and magnetic
dipoles by introducing a term that describes the driving of electric dipoles by
an applied magnetic ﬁeld, and the driving of magnetic dipoles by an applied
electric ﬁeld [18]. In eﬀect, this approach ﬁnds the eigenmodes of either the
electric or the magnetic dipole systems, and their polarizabilities (eigenval-
ues), irrespective to the eﬀect they have on the other dipole system. This de-
scription will necessarily have cross terms accounting for interaction between
the electric and magnetic eigenmodes and their polarizabilities, analogous to
tensor bianisotropic polarizabilities. However, while this is a full description
of the dipole system and it provides information on the resonances of elec-
tric and magnetic systems in the presence of each other, it does not describe
the simultaneous stable oscillations of both the electric and magnetic dipoles,
which are ultimately the resonances of the collective system. To consider the
eigenmodes and resonances of the collective system, we must consider both
electric and magnetic dipoles together. In this regard, it is necessary to intro-
duce relative scaling between the electric and magnetic dipoles to maintain
ﬁxed units of polarizability for the resulting eigenvalues, and to also main-
tain the passivity of eigenmodes at real frequencies. Moreover, the magnetic
−1, and the magnetic ﬁeld by a factor of
dipoles can be scaled by a factor of c0

(cid:112)µ0/0. An eigenmode |v(cid:105), having electric dipoles pv and magnetic dipoles

mv, will subsequently satisfy the coupled electric and magnetic dipole model
(Equation 9.8) as:

This expression describes a matrix equation for eigenmodes of the elec-
tric and magnetic dipole system describing N nanoparticles. The associated
6N × 6N matrix will, notably, not be symmetric when there is non-negligible
coupling between the electric and magnetic dipoles, and therefore the corre-
sponding eigenmodes will not maintain the pseudo-orthogonality analogous
to that in Equation 9.12 for currents. Nonetheless, it worth acknowledging
that this practice of replacing circulating current with magnetization remains

analogous to the practice used to deﬁne permeability for conventional mate-
rials. Therefore, the coupled electric and magnetic dipole model, including its
resonances and their associated eigenmodes, should maintain the appropriate
relationship to magnetic ﬁeld to be the base of our analysis of all-dielectric
nanoparticle oligomers.

9.3.2 Modal Interference and Fano Resonances

We begin by noting that both the current model and the dipole model de-
scribe open, radiative systems. As such, even in the absence of material loss,
the system does still exhibit radiation losses and is generally, therefore, non-
Hermitian. The immediate consequence of this non-Hermicity is that the
eigenmodes we have deﬁned in Equations 9.10, 9.13 and 9.14 are not nec-
essarily orthogonal. To recognize the eﬀect of this nonorthogonality, and its
relation to the Fano resonances, we can refer to the extinction cross-section,
which describes the total loss in a system. To not make any assumptions on
the excitation ﬁeld, we can construct extinction from the sum of the scattering
and absorption cross-sections. The scattering cross-section can be calculated
from the integral of the far-ﬁeld scattered power, such as derived by Merchiers
et al. [43] for the case of electric and magnetic dipoles.

We are then able to rewrite the total extinction (Equation 9.18) in terms
of eigenmodes and eigenvalues. Moreover, we can divide the extinction into
two contributions: direct terms that provide contributions to extinction from
individual eigenmodes, and also interference terms coming from the overlap
between diﬀerent eigenmodes.

direct terms

interference terms

(9.20)

The direct terms are always greater than zero due to the inscribed passivity
of eigenmodes, and interference terms would notably all be zero for orthog-
onal eigenmodes. Furthermore, the existence of nonzero interference terms,
and thereby the presence of nonorthogonal eigenmodes, is required for Fano
resonances to exist. This conclusion is because a given eigenmode’s excita-
tion, being the ai coeﬃcients of Equation (9.19), will be independent from
the excitations of other eigenmodes; a conclusion directly from the pseudo-
orthogonality in Equation 9.12. As such, the only way an interaction be-
tween two or more eigenmodes aﬀects the extinction cross-section through
interference terms, meaning that Fano resonances and other such phenom-
ena attributed to the interaction between modes can only be a result of the
nonorthogonality of eigenmodes. This is indeed the conclusion of earlier works
on the Fano resonances arising in nanoparticle oligomers [18,45], and is in good
accordance with Fano resonances that have been proposed and observed to
occur between modes that are directly driven by the incident ﬁeld [46, 47]. As
an example, we now consider heptamers made from gold nanospheres shown
in Figure 9.3a. By performing an eigenmode decomposition of this system, we
show the direct terms of extinction coming from the dominant eigenmodes,
in addition to the total extinction. This means the diﬀerence between total
extinction and the sum of direct terms are the interference terms is coming
from eigenmode overlap. For the case of the gold heptamer, we have a typical

9 All-dielectric Nanophotonic Structures

scenario of the Fano resonances: the overlap of a broad resonance and a sharp
resonance, and coupling that leads to destructive interference. This gold hep-
tamer thereby shows a classical example of a Fano resonance [15], where the
coupling between resonances is coming from eigenmode nonorthogonality.

Fig. 9.3. (Dashed lines) Extinction spectra of gold and silicon heptamers, simulated
using the dipole model Equation 9.8 and showing the role of eigenmode interference
in producing Fano resonances. (Solid lines) Overlaid direct terms to extinction, as
per Equation 9.20, for all three excited eigenmodes of the gold heptamers, and the six
most dominant eigenmodes for the silicon heptamers. The grey regions correspond
to wavelength bands near exceptional points. Both gold and silicon nanospheres are
150 nm in diameter.

However, as seen in Figure 9.3b, the situation becomes dramatically more
complicated for a silicon heptamer. The number of eigenmodes of this system

wavelength, nmextinction, μm2Goldwavelength, nmSilicong = 50nmg = 0nmsingle x 214

is much higher, because of both the additional magnetic dipoles and because
electric-magnetic dipole coupling (c.f. Equation 9.9) allows each dipole to be
polarized parallel to the propagation direction [48]. The ﬁrst consequence of
this increased eigenmode count is that there are many more signatures of in-
terference phenomena occurring across the extinction spectra. However, the
second consequence is that we have to accept the formation of exceptional
points. An exceptional point refers to a point degeneracy of two or more
eigenvalues when their eigenmodes simultaneously become linearly dependent,
subsequently corresponding to a reduction in the dimension of the span of
eigenmodes [49–51]. Exceptional points can exist even in simple plasmonic
and dielectric oligomer systems at complex frequencies [48], but will occur
more regularly when there are more interacting eigenmodes. A full discussion
on the properties of exceptional points will not be covered here. However, we
do need to recognize that, in the vicinity of one such exceptional point (e.g. at
real frequencies), we can observe diverging excitation magnitudes for eigen-
modes, to account for the component of the driving ﬁeld that is gradually
becoming orthogonal to the spanning eigenmodes. Notably, these diverging
ﬁelds have no signiﬁcant impact on the extinction produced by the spanning
eigenmodes because their eigenvalues are also approaching degenerate. We
have therefore attempted to divert attention away from the direct terms of
extinction from eigenmodes near exceptional points in Figure 9.3b. However,
the reason we must deal with such features is ultimately because the number
of eigenmodes that are excited by a normally-incident plane wave in a dielec-
tric oligomer can be more than double that for a plasmonic oligomer. Indeed,
for normally-incident plane wave, the number of excitable eigenmodes in such
rotationally-symmetric plasmonic oligomers is relatively contained: two degen-
erate pairs of eigenmodes for each ring of nanoparticles and one further pair
if there is central nanoparticle [18]. On the other hand, the coupling between
electric and magnetic dipoles in dielectric oligomers removes such eigenmode
restrictions, allowing many more excitable eigenmodes; which is now depen-
dent on the number of nanoparticles in each ring [48]. This means that even
simple arrangements of dielectric nanoparticles can be used to achieve behav-
ior of more complicated plasmonic oligomers, an example of which will be
investigated in the next section.

Finally, as an addendum, we should recognize that there is a degree of
freedom in how to attribute extinction to each given eigenmode. In particular,
rather than separating direct and interference terms as per Equation 9.20,
Frimmer et al. [46] attributed the extinction associated with a given eigenmode
to the projection of this eigenmode onto the complete incident ﬁeld.

In this approach, Fano resonances appear as negative extinction from an eigen-

terms. While not emphasizing the role of modal overlap in producing Fano
resonances, this approach still ultimately contains the same interactions and
nonorthogonality of eigenmodes. However, it is important to reiterate that
the eigenmodes themselves are still fundamentally passive; they are basis vec-
tors that produce only positive extinction; negative extinction arises from the
interaction between eigenmodes. The choice of deconstructing extinction us-
ing Equation 9.20 or 9.21, is eﬀectively a question of whether to separate
interference terms.

9.3.3 Hybridization for Nanoparticle Dimers

Up until now, the eigenmodes and eigenvalues we obtain have been calcu-
lated purely through numerics and we do not necessarily obtain information
on the importance of geometric or design parameters. Here we will show a
way to calculate the eigenmodes by subdividing the optical response of the
complete structure into a set of constituent responses. In eﬀect, what we will
present is a so-called hybridization approach, but one that has been simpli-
ﬁed and tailored for nanoparticle structures by using the electric and magnetic
dipole model in Equations 9.8 and 9.14. Moreover, when considering relatively
simple nanoparticle oligomer structures, it becomes possible to derive analyt-
ical expressions for the eigenmodes. This simpliﬁed approach of deriving the
eigenmodes in terms of the constituent parts was introduced and presented
for the case of a nanoparticle trimer [48]. Here, however, we will consider the
more typical case of a nanoparticle dimer. Indeed, there has been a recent
surging interest in silicon nanoparticle dimers, which have been observed to
exhibit behavior such as Fano resonances, directionality and magnetic near-
ﬁeld enhancement [52, 53]. There is also a growing interest in hybrid dimers
consisting both high-index dielectric nanoparticles and plasmonic nanoparti-
cles, including predictions of antiferromagnetic behavior [54]. In any case, the
complete solutions of the eigenmodes and eigenvalues in a symmetric dimer
has previously been calculated analytically by Merchiers et al [43], although
the scaling between electric and magnetic dipoles in Equation 9.14 was not
accounted for. We will instead go further and demonstrate the simpliﬁed hy-
bridization approach for the case of an asymmetric dimer. This will allow us
to encompass some of these recent works that utilize asymmetry, but also the
case of a particle on a substrate, as the substrate responds as a virtual image
of the particle. However, to limit complexity, we restrict our analysis to diag-
onal tensor dipole polarizabilities with three primary axes (x, y and z axes),
thereby neglecting both cross terms and bianisotropic terms.

(9.23)

The relative scaling of the electric and magnetic dipole moments, and of the
electric and magnetic applied ﬁelds, is again used to deﬁne eigenmodes with
consistent units and thereby ensure that the eigenvalues have units. Using
the state notation in Equation 9.23, the eigenmode equation (Equation 9.14)
can be compactly written in terms of both a polarizability operator ˆα and a
Green’s function operator ˆG.

(cid:16)

−1 − ˆG(cid:17)|v(cid:105) .

λ|v(cid:105) =

ˆα

(9.24)
This allows us to ﬁnd simpliﬁed matrix versions of the ˆα and ˆG operators for
subsets of eigenmodes that transform according to a single irreducible repre-
sentation of the dimer’s symmetry point group. In particular, when consid-
ering the general case of an asymmetric dimer with achiral nanoparticles, we
reduce the set of geometric symmetry operations to those of a C1h ⊗ ˆσv point
group. We can then deﬁne basis vectors of the dimer’s optical response to be
the eigenmodes of the ˆG operator in the absence of electric to magnetic dipole
coupling. These basis vectors are those shown in Fig. 9.4, which are named
according to their irreducible representations in the C1h point group, but
with an additional subscript x, y, z to distinguish the orientation of each such
basis vector and account for anisotropic nanoparticles as per Equation 9.22.
Notably these basis vectors are more commonly associated with the eigen-
modes of a symmetric dimer, but they are also practical for an asymmetric
dimer because they still form a complete basis for its optical response. More-
over, because they are eigenmodes of the Green’s function operator in the
absence of electric to magnetic coupling, we only need to consider coupling
−1 operator, and the channels
channels between basis vectors created by the ˆα
due to electric to magnetic coupling. In Fig. 9.4, we use the convention where a
dashed line represents an coupling channel from the dissimilarity of nanopar-
−1 polarizability operator and an unbroken line represents the
ticles in the ˆα
bianisotropic coupling channels in the ˆG Green’s function operator. The mag-
nitudes of these coupling channels can be determined from the polarizabilties
of each nanoparticle, and from the dipole model in Equation 9.8.

These three ratios are suﬃcient to produce expressions for each eigenmode
when normalized to bi, a dependence that is removed by simply normalizing
each eigenmode. In Figure 9.5a, we demonstrate that this analytical expres-
sion for the eigenmodes is able to accurately predict the optical extinction of
an asymmetric dimer made from silicon nanospheres. However, the dimer we
consider also doubles as an example of how electric to magnetic coupling can
be utilized, in this case for directional scattering. Moreover, referring to Fig-
ure 9.1, we see that the magnetic dipole resonance of a 150 nm silicon sphere
roughly coincides with the electric resonance of a 200 nm silicon sphere. If we,
therefore, arrange two such spheres as a dimer, we can utilize the coupling
to mix electric and magnetic resonances of the single particles into collective
modes. The 150 nm silicon sphere’s magnetic dipole resonance is stronger
than the 200 nm silicon sphere’s electric dipole resonance. So, with plane
wave excitation and magnetic ﬁeld polarization perpendicular to the axis of
the dimer, we can provide damping on the single particle magnetic resonance
as it couples into the electric dipoles parallel to propagation direction (c.f.
Figure 9.4). The coupling can then be controlled by simply adjusting the gap
between the two silicon nanospheres, allowing us to equalize the total electric
and magnetic dipole moments from this collective system to approach the
conditions for weak duality [55, 56]. Indeed, as seen in Figure 9.5b, this ap-
proach leads to strong directional scattering, which is a result of an equality
of the total electric and magnetic dipole moments in this system seen through
Figure9.5c. Notably, we maximize the scattering in this approach, which is
diﬀerent to recent realizations of silicon nanosphere dimers that produce di-
rectional scattering by utilizing Fano resonances, and, in doing so, minimize
scattering [52].

For our dimer system we can further provide analysis of this behavior from
the perspective of the collective eigenmodes. Indeed, in Figure 9.6, we see how
the previous description of coupling between magnetic dipoles and electric
dipoles parallel to the propagation direction can be related to three particular

eigenmodes. The ﬁrst two eigenmodes (i and ii) are dominated by the pure
electric and magnetic dipole of the 200 nm and 150 nm single particles, respec-
tively. A third eigenmode (iii) then facilitates coupling of the plane wave into
the electric dipoles polarized parallel to the propagation direction. The combi-
nation of these three eigenmodes then describes the directional scattering we
observed in Figure 9.5b, in a way that is related to the collective resonances
of the nanoparticle dimer. This thereby demonstrates one avenue by which
the eigenmode approach can be used to understand the optical properties of
dielectric nanoparticle oligomers.

9.3.4 Dimensionless Eigenvalues

The eigenmodes and the eigenvalues we presented until now have been to un-
derstand a polarizability relationship between either dipoles or currents and
the driving ﬁeld. However, in some situations it may also be informative to

know the eigenmodes of a geometry where there is no driving ﬁeld, such as for
pulsed excitation. These eigenmodes of the undriven system, having current
distributions J v, represent the underlying stable currents or dipole moments
of a given structure; what the structure would independently settle to and is
otherwise shifted or altered by a driving ﬁeld. Notably, the associated eigenval-
ues Λv of this situation are then not polarizabilities, but rather dimensionless
values for the self-feedback strength of the given current or dipole distribution.

Comparing this expression to Equation 9.10, we can see that there is no dis-
tinction between eigenmodes with or without a driving ﬁeld when the given
structure is made up of a homogeneous isotropic material. It is only when we
introduce additional materials in our scattering system that the stable reso-
nances are changed by the presence of a driving ﬁeld. However, if we consider
the analogous situation for the dipole model in Equation 9.5, the eigenmodes
are only unchanged when there is only a single isotropic polarizability for all
dipoles. Furthermore, there generally will be a distinction in dipole systems
that consist both electric and magnetic dipoles. Moreover, we can consider
eigenmodes {Pv, Mv} of the electric and magnetic dipole model in Equa-
tion 9.8 when there is no driving ﬁeld.

This expression will produce diﬀerent eigenmodes to that of Equation 9.14,
and it provides insight into a diﬀerent characteristic of the given scattering
system. Notably, we do not need to scale the electric and magnetic dipoles to
have correct units for the eigenvalue; it now remains unitless for any scaling
between electric and magnetic dipoles.

9.4 Observation of Fano Resonances in Nanoparticle
Oligomers

The study of Fano resonances in plasmonic nanoparticle structures has a long
history, whereas the theoretical predictions [17, 18] and experimental demon-
strations [13, 22, 23, 48, 52] of Fano resonances in all-dielectric nanoparticle
oligomers has been reported only recently. In comparison to the oligomers
composed of plasmonic nanoparticles, all-dielectric oligomer structures sup-
port both strong electric and magnetic resonances in the individual constituent
elements and open up a whole new dimension for mutual inter-element cou-
pling and, consequently, for the formation of collective modes. Indeed, it was
recently predicted in theory [17, 18] that light scattering by silicon oligomers
should exhibit well-pronounced Fano resonances originating from the predom-
inant excitation of optically-induced magnetic dipole modes in the individual
elements of the oligomer structure.

The Fano resonance is traditionally recognized as arising from the interfer-
ence of broad and narrow spectral lines, yet the concept can be also extended
to encompass the situation of interference between several electric or/and
magnetic modes of comparable spectral width [18]. Importantly, the resulting
asymmetric line-shape of the Fano resonance is still clearly observed in both
theory and experiment since the destructive and constructive interference take
place in a narrow spectral range exhibiting strongly resonant response. The
existence of such Fano resonances in silicon oligomers might oﬀer a range of
novel possibilities for applications, owing to their higher resistance to heat as
compared to optical metal nanostructures and to the possibility of free carrier
generation in the material. In this regard, Figure 9.7 presents the experimental
results for the observation of Fano resonances in heptamer oligomers composed
of Si nanodisks. In particular, Fig. 9.7(a) shows top view SEM images of sev-
eral heptamer structures arranged in two-dimensional arrays with a lattice
constant of 2840 nm. This value has been chosen in order to ensure that the
separation between neighboring structures is large enough for dominant cou-
pling to remain within each oligomer structure, while the in-plane density of
oligomer structures is still suﬃciently high to create pronounced resonances in
the far-ﬁeld spectra. The measurement results of linear-optical transmittance
spectra from four, silicon nanodisk heptamer arrays, with varying central nan-
odisk diameter and unpolarized incident light, are presented in Figure 9.7(b).
The experimental and theoretical extinction spectra show a good qualitative

structures with unpolarized incident light, and (c) theoretically calculated results

the heptamers (see gray-shaded region and colored arrows), and it moves across the

agreement. In both sets of results two distinct extinction peaks for each spec-
trum are observed. The peak at longer wavelengths is corresponds with the
magnetic resonance of the collective structure. The second peak, which is ob-
served at shorter wavelengths, is associated with the magnetic resonance of the
central particle. By analyzing the major collective modes of the oligomer struc-
tures corresponding with its dominant resonances, numerical calculations [22]
further unveil the main mechanism of eigenmode interference realized in the
heptamer structures. This conﬁrms that the observed Fano resonances indeed
originate from interference between the optically-induced magnetic resonances
of the central particles and those of the collective structures.

Later, Filonov et al. [57] demonstrated the existence of Fano resonances in
all-dielectric oligomer structures in a series of microwave experiments. They
conﬁrmed this result by both far- and near-ﬁeld measurements, including the
studies of the forward scattering and phase distribution across the structure.

26

The resonant suppression of the scattering was observed to be accompanied by
the π phase jump at the central particle, and this was conﬁrmed by the modal
analysis based on the coupled-dipole approximation, which allows to clearly
identify the particular supermodes contributing to the resonant interference
phenomena. In addition, the authors observed a unique type of Fano resonance
in hexamer oligomers without a central particle; this type of Fano resonance
originates from the interference of electric-type supermodes, and it exhibits an
asymmetric proﬁle due to the presence of both constructive and destructive
interference phenomena.

Fig. 9.8. Comparison between theoretical and experimental results for quadrumer
oligomers. (a) Numerical simulation results and (b) experimental measurements of
extinction for a quadrumer made of four MgOTiO2 ceramic spheres. Also shown
is the extinction from a single MgO-TiO2 sphere for reference. In both simulation
and experiment the existence of a sharp Fano resonance occurring at 5.4 GHz is
detected [23].

Because dielectric nanoparticles enable a diﬀerent coupling mechanism be-
tween electric and magnetic resonances, Fano resonances can be clearly ob-
served for smaller number of particles such as trimers [48] and quadrumers [23].
In particular, the magnetic ﬁeld polarized along quadrumers principle axis
can produce a resonant circulation of ﬁeld that can couple to the inherent
magnetic response of the individual nanoparticles. The interference between
magnetic responses can then be tailored to produce distinctive and sharp mag-
netic Fano resonances [23]. This form of optically induced magnetic–magnetic
coupling and interference is a unique characteristic of properly designed dielec-
tric nanoclusters. To verify the theoretical predictions experimentally, Hop-
kins et al. [23] studied scattering properties of MgOTiO2 ceramic spheres
characterized by dielectric constant of 16 measured at 9–12 GHz. These ce-
ramic spheres in the microwave range therefore have very similar properties

to silicon nanospheres in the optical range, and they were employed as a
useful macroscopic platform on which to prototype silicon nanostructures.
The MgO-TiO2 quadrumer consists of four dielectric spheres with diameter
15 mm, and the size of the gap between the particles is 5 mm. The experimen-
tally measured, and numerically calculated, total scattering of the quadrumer
structure is shown in Figure 9.8. It can clearly be seen that a magnetic Fano
resonance is produced at 5.4 GHz in both simulation and experiment. This
is the ﬁrst example of a magnetic–magnetic Fano resonance in a single sym-
metric metamolecule. Notably, this Fano resonance occurs in a spectral range
where the single particle is not at resonance, which demonstrates its collec-
tive nature. Indeed, it appears near the intersection of the single particle’s
electric and magnetic scattering contributions, reﬂecting that the overlap of
eigenmodes is dependent on both electric and magnetic dipole polarizabilities.
The role of individual electric and magnetic dipoles has also been considered
relating to Fano resonances arising from the interaction between broad and
narrow modes in dimers composed of two diﬀerent silicon nanospheres [52].
The silicon nanosphere dimer exhibits a strong internal magnetic response,
with an electric enhancement in the gap, providing an excellent structure to
support magnetic-based Fano scattering. The interactions between magnetic
and electric dipoles can then suppress backward scattering and enhance for-
ward scattering at Fano wavelengths. This directional scattering is much more
prominent than that from a single silicon sphere and shows promising applica-
tions in areas such as directional nanoantennas or optical switching, opening
up future avenues for developing all-dielectric nanophotonic devices.

9.5 Conclusions

The study of resonant dielectric and semiconductor nanoparticle structures
has become a new research direction in modern optics and nanophotonics. Due
to their unique optically-induced Mie-type electric and magnetic resonances,
such high-index dielectric photonic structures are expected to complement or
substitute some of the plasmonic components in a range of potential applica-
tions. The unique low-loss resonant behavior makes it possible to reproduce
many subwavelength resonant eﬀects demonstrated in nanophotonics without
much energy dissipation into heat. In addition, the co-existence of strong elec-
tric and magnetic resonances, their interference and resonant enhancement of
the magnetic response in dielectric nanoparticles bring new physics and en-
tirely novel functionalities to simple nanoparticle geometries; a direction that
has not much explored, especially in the nonlinear regime.
