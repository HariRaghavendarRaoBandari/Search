Abstract We extend the investigation of the Gener-
alized Parton Distribution for a charged pion within
a fully covariant constituent quark model, in two re-
spects: (i) calculating the tensor distribution and (ii)
adding the treatment of the evolution, needed for achiev-
ing a meaningful comparison with both the experimen-
tal parton distribution and the lattice evaluation of the
so-called generalized form factors. Distinct features of
our phenomenological covariant quark model are: (i)
a 4D Ansatz for the pion Bethe-Salpeter amplitude,
to be used in the Mandelstam formula for matrix ele-
ments of the relevant current operators, and (ii) only
two parameters, namely a quark mass assumed to hold
mq = 220 MeV and a free parameter ﬁxed through
the value of the pion decay constant. The possibility of
increasing the dynamical content of our covariant con-
stituent quark model is brieﬂy discussed in the context
of the Nakanishi integral representation of the Bethe-
Salpeter amplitude.

1 Introduction

The present theory of strong interaction, the Quantum
Chromodynamics (QCD), should in principle allow one
to achieve a complete 3D description of hadrons, in
terms of the Bjorken variable xB and the transverse

momenta of the constituents. As it is well-known, the
needed non perturbative description still represents a
challenge, that motivates a large amount of valuable ef-
forts, both on the experimental side (gathering new ac-
curate data, that in turn impose stringent constraints
on theoretical investigations) and the theoretical one
(performing more and more reﬁned lattice calculations
and elaborating more and more reliable phenomenolog-
ical models).

Heuristically, while the short-distance behavior of
the hadronic state has been well understood, given the
possibility of applying a perturbative approach, entailed
by the asymptotic freedom, the long-range part of the
hadronic state, that is governed by the conﬁnement, re-
quests non perturbative tools, suitable for a highly non
linear dynamics. Coping with the diﬃcult task to gain
information on the hadronic state, in the whole range of
its extension, has been the main motivation for elabo-
rating phenomenological models, that in general play a
helpful role in shedding light onto the non perturbative
regime.

Among the phenomenological approaches, covari-
ant constituent quark models (CCQMs) represent an
important step forward, since they exploit a quark-
hadron vertex fulﬁlling the fundamental property of co-
variance with respect to the Poincar´e group. Moreover,
CCQM’s based on the Light-front (LF) framework, in-
troduced by Dirac in 1949 [1], with variables deﬁned
by: a± = a0 ± a3 and a⊥ ≡ {ax, ay}, appear to be quite
suitable for describing relativistic, interacting systems,
like hadrons. Indeed, the LF framework has several ap-
pealing features (see, e.g., [2]), quite useful for exploring
nowadays issues in hadronic phenomenology. Beyond
the well-known fact that the dynamics onto the light-
cone is naturally described in terms of LF variables, one

2

should mention : (i) the straightforward separation of
the global motion from the intrinsic one (related to the
subgroup property of the LF boosts), (ii) the largest
number of kinematical (i.e. not aﬀected by the interac-
tion) Poincar´e generators, (iii) the large extent of triv-
iality of the vacuum, within a LF ﬁeld theory [2] (with
the caveat of the zero-mode contributions). In particu-
lar, for the pion, one can construct the following mean-
ingful Fock expansion onto the null-plane

|π(cid:105) = |q ¯q(cid:105) + |q ¯q q ¯q(cid:105) + |q ¯q g(cid:105).....

where |q ¯q(cid:105) is the valence component. It has to be re-
called that an appealing feature of our approach, based
on a covariant description of the quark-pion vertex (see
[3,4] and references quoted therein), is the possibility
of naturally taking into account contributions beyond
the valence term.

The experimental eﬀorts are very intense for sin-
gling out quantities that are sensitive to the dynamical
features of the hadronic states. In particular, in the last
decade, it has been recognized that a wealth of infor-
mation on the 3D partonic structure of hadrons is con-
tained in the Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs)
(see, e.g., Ref. [5] for a general presentation), as well
as in the Transverse-momentum Distributions (TMDs)
(see, e.g., Ref. [6] for a detailed discussion). GPDs can
be experimentally investigated through the Deeply Vir-
tual Compton Scattering (DVCS), while TMDs can be
studied through Semi-inclusive Deep Inelastic Scatter-
ing (SIDIS) processes, which notably involve polariza-
tion degrees of freedom.

Our aim, is to provide a phenomenological model,
that has the following main ingredients: (i) a 4D Ansatz
for the pion Bethe-Salpeter amplitude, and (ii) the gen-
eralization of the Mandelstam formula [7] for matrix
elements of the relevant current operators (notice that
the pion Bethe-Salpeter amplitude is needed in this for-
mula). Remarkably, we introduce only two parameters,
namely a constituent quark mass and a free parame-
ter ﬁxed through the value of the pion decay constant.
Through our model, we investigate the pion state by
thoroughly comparing the results with both experimen-
tal and lattice data relevant for the 3D description of
the pion. In this paper, we complete the evaluation of
the leading-twist pion GPDs, calculating the so-called
tensor GPD (see Ref. [3] for the vector GPD and Ref. [8,
9] for preliminary calculations of the tensor one). More-
over, in order to accomplish the previously mentioned
comparisons, we consider the evolution of quantities
that can be extracted from the GPDs, like the parton
distribution function (PDF) and the generalized form
factors (GFF). We anticipate that only the leading or-
der (LO) evolution has been implemented by using the

standard code of Ref. [10]. In particular, the compari-
son has been performed between our LO results and the
experimental pion PDF extracted in Ref. [11] (see Ref.
[12] for the NLO extraction) and the available lattice
calculations of GFFs as given in Refs. [13, 14, 15,16].

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, the gen-
eral formalism and the deﬁnitions are brieﬂy recalled. In
Sec. 3, our Covariant Constituent Quark Model is pre-
sented. In Sec. 4, the LO evolution of the quantities we
want to compare is thoroughly discussed, with a partic-
ular care to the determination of the initial scale of our
model. In Sec. 5, the comparison of our results with
both the experimental PDF and the available lattice
calculations is presented. Finally in Sec. 6, the Conclu-
sion are drawn.

2 Generalities

In this Section, the physical quantities, GPDs and TMDs,
that allow us to achieve a detailed 3D description of a
pion are shortly introduced, since they represent the
target of the investigation within our CCQM (for accu-
rate and extensive reviews on GPDs, see, e.g. [5] and on
TMDs, see, e.g. [6]). For the pion, given its null total
angular momentum, one has two GPDs and two TMDs,
at the leading twist.

2.1 Generalized Parton Distributions

As it is well known, GPDs are LF-boost invariant func-
tions, and allow one to parametrize matrix elements
(between hadronic states) involving quark and gluon
ﬁelds. In particular, GPDs are oﬀ-diagonal (respect to
the hadron four-momenta, i.e. pf (cid:54)= pi,) matrix ele-
ments of quark-quark (or gluon-gluon) correlator pro-
jected onto the Dirac basis (see, e.g., Ref. [17] for a
thorough investigation of the pion case). The appealing
feature of GPDs is given by the ability of summarizing
in a natural way information contained in several ob-
servables investigated in diﬀerent kinematical regimes,
like electromagnetic (em), form factors (FFs) or PDFs.

The pion has two leading-twist quark GPDs: i) the
vector, or no spin-ﬂip, GPD, H I
π(x, ξ, t), and ii) the ten-
sor, or spin-ﬂip, GPD, EI
π,T (x, ξ, t) (where I = IS, IV
labels isoscalar and isovector GPDs, respectively). In
order to avoid Wilson-line contributions, one can choose

comparing lattice calculations and phenomenological
results.

3

The relation between the non-spin ﬂip GPD and
the em FF given in Eq. (4) for a charged pion can be
in some sense generalized, if one considers Mellin mo-
ments of both vector and tensor GPDs. Then one ob-
tains the corresponding GFFs. For instance, one can
write the following Mellin moments of both vector and
tensor GPDs for the u-quark (see [5,18] for a review)

dx xnH u

π (x, ξ, t) =

(2ξ)2iAu

n+1,2i(t) ,

(6)

[(n+1)/2](cid:88)
[(n+1)/2](cid:88)

i=0

i=0

where the symbol [...] indicates the integer part of the
argument. In Eqs. (6) and (7), Au
n+1,2i(t) is a vector
GFF for a u-quark and Bu
n+1,2i(t) a tensor GFF, re-
spectively. It is worth noting that one can introduce a
diﬀerent decomposition in terms of isoscalar and isovec-
tor components instead of a ﬂavor decomposition. In
particular, if n + 1 is even (odd) one has an isoscalar
(isovector) GFF. A striking feature is shown by the rhs
of Eqs. (6) and (7), the so-called polinomiality, i..e. the
dependence upon ﬁnite powers of the variable ξ. This
polynomiality property follows from completely general
properties like covariance, parity and time-reversal in-
variance; for this reason it can be a good test for any
model.

At the present stage, only a few moments of the
pion GPDs have been evaluated within lattice QCD,
but they represent a valuable test ground for any phe-
nomenological model that aspires to yield meaningful
insights into the pion dynamics. In view of the nu-
merical results discussed below, we brieﬂy recall how

A physical interpretation of GFFs (see, e.g., [19,20,
21]) can be achieved by properly generalizing the stan-
dard interpretation of the non relativistic em FFs to a
relativistic framework. Non relativistically, the em FFs
are the 3D Fourier transforms of intrinsic (Galilean-
invariant) em distributions in the coordinate space (e.g.,
for the pion, one has the charge distribution, while, for

4

the nucleon, one has both charge and magnetic distri-
butions). In the relativistic case, one should consider
Fourier transforms of GPDs, that depend upon vari-
ables invariant under LF boosts. Indeed, only the trans-
verse part of ∆µ can be trivially conjugated to variables
in the coordinate space, while for x and ξ (proportional
to ∆+) this is not possible. Therefore, keeping the de-
scription invariant for proper boosts (i.e. LF boosts),
one can introduce 2D Fourier transforms with respect to
∆⊥. Such a Fourier transform allows one to investigate
the spatial distributions of the quarks in the so-called
impact-parameter space (IPS). In particular, from Eq.
(6) and (7), it straightforwardly follows that, for ξ = 0,
only Au
n+1,0(∆2) survive. Due to the
LF-invariance of ξ, one has an inﬁnite set of frames
(Drell-Yan frames) where ξ = 0. In these frames, where
∆+ = 0 and ∆2 = −∆2⊥, one can introduce the above
mentioned 2D Fourier transforms in a boost-invariant
way (recall that, for a given reaction, the ﬁnal state or
both ﬁnal and initial states have to be boosted). One
can write

n+1,0(∆2) and Bu

(2π)2 ei∆⊥·b⊥ Bq

n,0(∆2)

n(b⊥) =

˜Bq
(11)
where b⊥ = |b⊥|, is the impact parameter. In general,
the Fourier transform of GFFs, for ξ = 0, yield quark
densities in the IPS [19,20,21]. In particular, ˜An(b⊥)
represents the probability density of ﬁnding an unpo-
larized quark in the pion at a certain distance b⊥ from
the transverse center of momentum. In addition, if one
considers the polarization degrees of freedom, then one
introduces the probability density of ﬁnding a quark
with a given transverse polarization, s⊥ in a certain
Drell-Yan frame. In the IPS, such a probability distri-
bution is

(13)

It is worth noting that the quark longitudinal (or helic-
ity) distribution density is given only by the ﬁrst term
in Eq. (12), since the pion is a pseudoscalar meson and
the term γ5/sL in the quark density operator has a van-
ishing expectation, due to the parity invariance [16,22].
Equation (12) is quite rich of information and clearly
indicates the pivotal role of GPDs for accessing the
quark distribution in the IPS. Moreover, as a closing
remark, one could exploit Eq
πT to extract more elusive
information on the quasi-particle nature of the con-
stituent quarks, like their possible anomalous magnetic

moments, once the vector current that governs the quark-
photon coupling is suitably improved (see subsect. 5.4
and Ref. [23] for a discussion within the lattice frame-
work).

2.2 Transverse momentum distributions

TMDs are diagonal (in the pion four-momentum1) ma-
trix elements of the quark-quark (or gluon-gluon) cor-
relator with the proper Wilson-line contributions (see,
e.g., Ref. [17]) and suitable Dirac structures. Moreover,
TMDs depend upon x and the quark transverse momen-
tum, k⊥, that is not the conjugate of b⊥. It should be
pointed out that in general the Wilson-line eﬀects must
be carefully analyzed, due to the explicit dependence
upon k⊥ (recall that for GPDs such dependence is in-
tegrated out). At the leading-twist, one has two TMDs,
1 (x,|k⊥|2), that yields the
for the pion: the T-even f q
probability distribution to ﬁnd an unpolarized quark
with LF momentum {x, k⊥} in the pion, and the T-
odd hq⊥
1 (x,|k⊥|2, η), related to a transversely-polarized
quark and called Boer-Mulders distribution [24].

The two TMDs allow one to parametrize the distri-
bution of a quark with given LF momentum and trans-
verse polarization, i.e. (see, e.g., Ref. [15,17])

siijkj⊥

(14)

where the dependence upon the variable η in h⊥
1 is gen-
erated by the Wilson-line eﬀects, whose role is essential
for investigating a non vanishing h⊥

1 (see e.g. [24]).
At the lowest order, the unpolarized TMD f q

1 , is
given by the proper combination of the isoscalar and
isovector components, that are deﬁned by

that are equal to zero, due to the time-reversal invari-
ance. In order to get a non vanishing Boer-Mulders dis-
tribution, one has to evaluate at least a ﬁrst-order cor-
rection, involving Wilson lines (see, e.g., Refs. [25] and
[17]). Moreover, by adopting the light-cone gauge and
the advanced boundary condition for the gauge ﬁeld,
the eﬀect of the Wilson lines (ﬁnal state interaction ef-
fects) can be shifted into complex phases aﬀecting the
initial state (see, e.g., Ref. [26]).

3 The Covariant Constituent Quark Model

The main ingredients of our covariant constituent quark
model are two: i) the extension to the GPDs and TMDs
of the Mandelstam formalism [7], originally introduced
for calculating matrix elements of the em current op-
erator when a relativistic interacting system is inves-
tigated, and ii) a model of the 4D quark-hadron ver-
tex, or equivalently the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude, nec-
essary for applying the Mandelstam approach. In par-
ticular, we have assumed a pion Bethe-Salpeter ampli-
tude (BSA) with the following form
Ψ (t, p) = − m
fπ

S (t + p/2) Γ (t, p) S (t − p/2)

(18)
where p = pq+p¯q is the total momentum, t = (pq−p¯q)/2
the relative momentum of the q ¯q pair (by using the
four-momenta k, ∆ and P previously introduced, one
has t + p/2 = k − ∆/2, and t − p/2 = k − P ). In Eq.
(18), S(pq) = 1/(/pq−mq +ı) is the fermion propagator
and Γ (t, p) the quark-pion vertex. In the present work,
only the dominant Dirac structure has been assumed,
viz

Γ (t, p) = γ5 Λπ(t, p)

(19)

with Λ(t, p) a suitable momentum-dependent scalar func-
tion that contains the dynamical information (see the
following subsections for more details). Indeed, Dirac
structures contributing to Γ (t, p) beyond γ5 should be
taken into account, but they have a minor impact on
the pion BSA, as thoroughly discussed in Ref. [27].

For the sake of completeness, let us recall that the
quark-pion vertex fulﬁlls the homogeneous BS equation
that reads as follows

(cid:90) d4t(cid:48)
(2π)4 K(t, t(cid:48)) S (t(cid:48) + p/2) Γ (t(cid:48), p) S (t(cid:48) − p/2)

Γ (t, p) =

=

(20)

5

where K(t, t(cid:48)) is the kernel given by the inﬁnite sum of
irreducible diagrams (see, e.g., [28]).

Finally, it is important to emphasize that our inves-
tigation, based on a covariant description of the quark-
pion vertex, naturally goes beyond a purely valence de-
scription of the pion [3,4].

3.1 The Mandelstam Formula for the electromagnetic
current

The Mandelstam formula allows one to express the ma-
trix elements of the em current of a composite bound
system, within a ﬁeld theoretical approach [7]. It has
been applied for evaluating the FFs of both pion [29,
30,31] and nucleon [32], obtaining a nice description of
both space- and timelike FFs. Furthermore, it has been
exploited for calculating the vector GPD of the pion [3,
4] and for a preliminary evaluation of the tensor GPD
[8,9].

For instance, in the case of the em spacelike FF of
the pion, the Mandelstam formula, where the quark-
pion vertex given in Eq. (19) is adopted, reads (see,
e.g., Ref. [29,30, 31])
jµ = − ıe R

portional to an anomalous magnetic moment, namely a
term like

is the valence wave function. It should be recalled that
Φ, properly integrated on κ⊥, yields the pion distribu-
tion amplitude (DA) (see Eq. (61) and, e.g., Ref. [5] for
a general discussion on the DAs and their evolution).
The generalization of Eq. (21) to the case of GPDs, can
be found in Ref. [3,4] for the vector GPD, and in [8, 9]
for the tensor one, but for the sake of completeness, let
us give the expression of both vector and tensor GPDs

3.2 The four-momentum dependence of the
Bethe-Salpeter amplitude

As above mentioned, in our CCQM we focus on the
main contribution to the pion BSA, i.e. the term con-
taining the Dirac matrix γ5. This implies that we have
to consider only one scalar function for describing the
dependence upon the four-momenta present in the prob-
lem. Unfortunately, solutions of the homogeneous BSE
for hadrons are still lacking in Minkowski space given
the extraordinary complexity of QCD, nonetheless very
relevant investigations have been carried out in Eu-
clidean space, within the lattice framework [13, 14,15,
16] or combining BSE and Dyson-Schwinger equation
(DSE) (see, e.g., [38] and references quoted therein) or
by exploiting a 3D reduction of the BSE itself (see,
e.g., [39]). On the other hand, since we would carry on
a comparison with a wide set of data, from both exper-
iments and lattice, we resort to adopt a phenomenolog-
ical Ansatz, that depends remarkably upon only two
parameters. This allows us to explore the potential-
ity of the Mandelstam approach in capturing the main
features of the physical quantities under consideration,
while having a reasonable predictive power, given the
small set of free parameters.

The following analytic covariant Ansatz for the mo-

mentum dependence of the BSA has been adopted

where j = 1, 2. The δ function allows one to have the
correct support for the active quark, i.e. when |ξ| ≤ x ≤
1. This kinematical region corresponds to the so-called
Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) re-
gion [33,34,35], or valence region. Moreover, CCQM is
able to address also kinematical region beyond the va-
lence one, i.e. −ξ ≤ x ≤ ξ, given the covariance prop-
erty. This region is called the Efremov-Radyushkin-Brodsky-
Lepage (ERBL) region [36,37], or non valence region.
If one adopts a Breit frame with ∆+ = −∆− ≥ 0, then
the ERBL region can be investigated. As a matter of
fact, in such a frame one can access the whole range
of the variable ξ, i.e. −1 ≤ ξ ≤ 1, and analyze both
valence and non valence regions within the same ap-
proach. This allows one to shed light on the interesting
topic of the smooth transition from the DGLAP (va-
lence) regime to the ERBL (non valence) one.
1 (x,|k⊥|2)
The expression of the unpolarized TMD f q
[3] can be easily obtained from the integrand of the
vector GPD, Eq. (24), by recalling the relation in Eq.
(16).

where the parameter mR is adjusted to ﬁt fπ, while the
constants C is ﬁxed through the charge normalization,
Fπ(t = 0) = 1, that amounts to the standard normal-
ization of the BSA, but in impulse approximation.

It is worth noting that the expression in Eq. (26) can
be cast (see below) in a form suggested by the integral
representation of the 4D n-leg transition amplitudes
(we are actually interested to n = 3) elaborated by
Nakanishi in the 60’s [40], within a perturbation-theory
framework. To quickly illustrate the appealing features
of this integral representation, one should consider the
n-leg transition amplitude for a many-scalar interacting
system, and the inﬁnite set of Feynman diagrams con-
tributing to determine the amplitude itself. In this case,
it turns out that the amplitude is given by the folding of
a weight function (called the Nakanishi weight function)
and a denominator (with some exponent) that contains
all the independent scalar products obtained from the
n external four-momenta. It has to be pointed out that
the analytic behavior of the amplitude is fully deter-
mined by such a denominator, and this clearly makes

the Nakanishi integral representation a valuable tool
for investigating 4D transition amplitudes. For n = 3,
one can apply the integral representation to the vertex
function for a system composed by two constituents,
and explicitly discuss the analytic structure, i.e. the
core of the physical content. Another pivotal motivation
that increases the interest on the Nakanishi framework
is given by the following computational ﬁnding: even if
the Nakanishi integral representation has been formally
established by considering the whole inﬁnite set of the
Feynman diagrams contributing to an amplitude, i.e. a
perturbative regime, it has been numerically shown that
also in a non perturbative framework, like the homo-
geneous BSE (relevant for describing bound systems),
the Nakanishi representation plays an essential role for
obtaining actual solutions for the vertex function or,
equivalently, for the BSA. Applying the Nakanishi rep-
resentation as an Ansatz for the solution of the BSE one
can determine the unknown Nakanishi weight function
and achieve a genuine numerical solution of the BSE
in Minkowski space. This approach has been applied
to the ladder BSE for two-scalar and two-fermion sys-
tems (see, e.g.,Refs. [41,42,43,44,45] for the Nakanishi
approach in Minkowski space and, for the sake of com-
parison, Ref. [46,47] for two-fermion systems within the
Euclidean hyperspherical approach), opening a viable
path for phenomenological studies within a non pertur-
bative regime.

Within the Nakanishi approach, the vertex function

(or three-leg amplitude) can be written as follows

where κ2 = m2
weight function. If we take g(γ, z; κ2) = δ(γ−m2

q),
one obtains Eq. (26). It should be pointed out that while
waiting for numerical solutions of the two-fermion sys-
tem with more reﬁned phenomenological kernels (for
the ladder approximation see Ref. [42]), one could per-
form an intermediate step, still in the realm of Ansatzes,
substituting Eq. (26) with Eq. (27), but adopting a dif-
ferent choice of the Nakanishi weight function, e.g. by
substituting the simple delta-like form with more re-
alistic functions (see e.g. [44] for the Nakanishi weight
functions of a two-scalar system obtained by actually
solving the homogeneous BSE in the ladder approxi-
mation). In order to set the reference line for the next
steps in the elaboration of our CCQM (presented else-
where), we will adopt the very manageable form given
in Eq. (26), in the following comparisons with the ex-
perimental and lattice results (see below, Sec. 5).

4 Evolution of Mellin Moments and GFF’s

In order to compare our results for PDF and GFFs with
experimental data and lattice calculations, it is funda-
mental to suitably evolve the CCQM outcomes, from
the unknown scale µCCQ to the needed ones, namely
µexp and µLAT .

Our strategy for determining an acceptable µCCQ
is to study the evolution of the non singlet PDF Mellin
within a LO framework, considering ﬂavor numbers up
to Nf = 4. It should be pointed out that the choice to
adopt the LO framework, seems to be well motivated by
the phenomenological nature of the CCQM, and by the
present uncertainties still aﬀecting both experimental
and lattice GFFs.

Let us shortly summarize our procedure for assign-
ing a scale µ to our calculations. The main ingredient
to be considered are the Mellin moments of the non
singlet distribution fN S(x, µ), viz

(cid:90) 1

MN S(n, µ) =

(28)

where fN S is related to the unpolarized GPD, as follows

fN S(x, µCCQ) = 2H I=1(x, 0, 0)

(29)

Mellin moments evolve from a scale µ0 to the scale µ
through very simple expressions (see, e.g., [48]), that
for the non singlet, singlet and gluon moments read

N S (1, µ0) = M CCQM

Indeed, we are interested to actually evolve only the mo-
ment n = 1 of fN S, since for this moment we can ﬁnd
several lattice calculations (but using diﬀerent approxi-
mations; cf Sec. 5). Our procedure requests to backward-
evolve the lattice M LAT
N S (1, µLAT ), down to a scale µ0
where M LAT
(1) (notice the absence
of the unknown scale dependence in the CCQM ﬁrst
moment). This value of the scale is taken as µCCQ.
From Eq. (43), one recognizes the necessity to ﬁrst
determine αLO
(µLAT , Nf ). This can be accomplished
starting from a generally accepted value of αs(µi, 3),
like αs(µi = 1 GeV, 3) = 0.68183 given in Ref. [50] (see
also Sect. 5 for the quantitative elaboration). To per-
form this step we have used the well-known expression

It should be pointed out that, as explicitly shown in
Eqs. (38) and (46), αs(µ, Nf ) depends upon the number
of ﬂavors Nf , at a given scale. Indeed, one has to be
particularly careful about the energy scales involved,
when one moves from a relatively low µi = 1 GeV to
µLAT = 2 GeV, large enough to produce a new quark
ﬂavor, so that Nf increases from 3 to 4. In view of
that, a suitable formula for moving from αs(µ, Nf ) to
αs(µ, Nf + 1) has been considered, viz (see, e.g., [51])

4.1 QCD Evolution of GFFs

Similarly to the more familiar case of PDFs, where the
QCD interaction among partons lead to collinear di-
vergences which are factored out and absorbed into a
dependence upon the energy scale, also in the case of
GPDs one has to deal with the issue of ﬁnding and
solving evolution equations. As a matter of fact, GPDs
do not depend on three variables but on four, namely
H(x, ξ, t, µ) and E(x, ξ, t, µ). However, the evolution
kernel does not depend on t, so that the relevant vari-
ables for the evolution are x, ξ, and µ. One should keep

is the same 2 × 2 matrix deﬁned in (33)
where Γ (0)
that depends upon Nf through γ(0)
GG. In Eqs. (49) and
(51), Γ (k) is the usual Euler function. Notice that the
dependence upon t in the GFF is not involved in the
evolution. Some example of explicit evolution equations
are

An0(t, µ) = Ln An0(t, µ0)
A22(t, µ) = L2 A22(t, µ0)

(53)

where A22(t, µ) is a 2D vector, with quark and gluon
components, and L2 a 2 × 2 matrix. For An0(t, µ) the
evolution equations become exactly equal to Eqs. (43)
and (44) for the odd and even n’s respectively. More-
over, since γ(0)
qq (n = 0) = 0 then L1 = 1. This is ex-
pected since A10(t = 0) is the charge (A10(t) is the em
form factor), namely a measurable quantity and there-
fore it cannot evolve.

For the tensor GFF BI

ni(t, µ), analogous arguments
can be carried out, but with a great simpliﬁcation. In
fact, at LO the gluon-quark and quark-gluon transi-
tion amplitudes that lead to the corresponding splitting
functions are vanishing for the helicity conservation (re-
call that ET (x, ξ, t) is related to an expectation value
with a transversely polarized quark and describes helic-
ity ﬂip transitions), therefore the anomalous dimension
matrix Γ (0)
T (n) is diagonal. Consequently, at LO it is not
necessary to separate the case of even and odd n, since
there is no mixing between quark and gluon evolutions,
and one can eventually write the evolution equation in
a form analogous to Eq. (49). In particular, the quark
component of the transverse GFFs, Bq
n0(t, µ), evolves
multiplicatively (see, e.g., [49,60, 61, 62]), viz

in mind that the evolution of GPDs is produced by the
combination of two regimes: (i) the one pertaining to
the valence region (|x| > |ξ|) and (ii) the one pertaining
to the non valence region (|x| < |ξ|). One could roughly
say that the evolution of GPDs interpolates [5] between
the two regions and therefore the evolution kernel has
to take into account the suitable physical content. In
particular, in the valence region a kernel acts with a
structure like the one present in the DGLAP equations,
while in the non valence region a modiﬁed ERBL ker-
nel is involved (see Refs. [54] and [55] for details on the
evolution of vector and tensor GPDs, respectively).

In our actual comparison, we do not consider the
full GPDs, but rather their Mellin moments, since they
can be in principle addressed by the lattice calculations.
As a matter of fact, GFFs covariantly parametrize the
Mellin moments of GPD (see Eqs. (6) and (7)), and
evolve through a suitable generalization of the Eqs. (43)
and (44) (see Refs. [49,56,57,58,59,60,61]). Let us re-
call, however, that GFFs are the coeﬃcients of poly-
nomials in ξ that yield the Mellin moments of GPDs
and not the Mellin moments themselves: for this reason
in general the equations describing GFFs evolution are
more complicated than Eqs. (43) and (44). Indeed one
can ﬁnd some notable exceptions where the equations
have a simple multiplicative structure.

For the vector GFFs AI

ni(t, µ2), one should recall
that the evolution of the isoscalar (singlet) GPD, and
consequently the evolution of the corresponding Mellin
moments, is coupled with the evolution of the gluonic
component. This leads one to separate the evolution of
GFFs with even and odd n, since for symmetry reasons
the even GFFs come from the isoscalar GPDs, while the
odd ones come from the isovector GPDs. By repeating
the main steps given in Ref. [57] (see also [58,59] where
general discussions are presented) for obtaining the evo-
lution equation of both non singlet and singlet vector
GFFs, we can express the results in Ref. [57] also as

5 Numerical Results

The reliability of the quark-pion vertex (26), introduced
for obtaining the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude (18), has
been ﬁrst checked by comparing our results for a charged
pion with the most accurate experimental data not af-
fected by the evolution, i.e. the spacelike em form fac-
tor. Theoretically, the em form factor, Fπ(t), is given
by the GFF A10(t). In Fig. (1) the results obtained by
diﬀerent models for the em FF are shown as a function
of (−t), together with the experimental data. To avoid
the use of a log plot, that prevents a detailed analysis,
the FF has been divided by the monopole function

Fmon(t) =

1

1 + |t|/m2

ρ

(58)

where mρ = 0.770 GeV. Interestingly, in order to test
the dependence upon the CQ mass, the results of our
CCQM evaluated for quark masses mq = 0.200, 0.210,
0.220 GeV, have been also shown, together with (i) the
results from a LF CQM where mq = 0.265 GeV and a
dressed quark-photon vertex were adopted [30,31]; (ii)
a ﬁt to the lattice data obtained in [23]. It has to be
pointed out that the ﬁt to the lattice data was pre-
sented in [23] itself, and it has the following monopole
expression

F lat

π (t) =

1

1 − t/M 2(mphys

π

)

(59)

π

π

with M (mphys
) = 0.727 GeV. The lattice results were
actually obtained for a pion mass mπ = 0.600 GeV, and
then extrapolated to the physical pion mass mphys
=
0.140 GeV, up to t = −4 GeV2 (see [23]). In Fig.
(1), for the sake of presentation, the monopole ﬁt (59)
has been arbitrarily extended up to t = −10 GeV2.
Once the CQ mass is assigned, our CCQM model de-
pends upon only one free parameter, the regulator mass
mR in Eq. (26). The value of mR is ﬁxed by calcu-
lating the pion decay constant fπ (cf Eq. (22)), while
the constant C is determined through Fπ(0), as al-
ready mentioned in subsec. 3.2. The PDG experimen-
tal value f exp
π = 0.0922 GeV [51] has been adopted.

In particular, for mq = 0.200, 210, 220 GeV, we got
mR = 1.453, 1.320, 1.192 GeV, respectively.

The following comments are in order: (i) a nice agree-
ment between the CCQM results and the experimental
FF at low momentum transfer leads to reproduce the
experimental value of the charge radius, < r2
exp >=
0.67 ± 0.02 fm; (ii) beyond −t = 0.5 GeV2, CCQM re-
sults begin to reveal an interesting sensitivity upon the
CQ mass, since if one changes the CQ mass by a 5%
then the corresponding CCQM FF changes by 10-15%,
at high momentum transfer; (iii) the CCQM FFs seem
to have a similar curvature of the data at high momen-
tum transfer, but in order to draw reliable conclusions,
useful for extracting information (and then improving
the CCQM), it is necessary to have more accurate data,
for −t ≥ 1 GeV2.

stituent Quark Model with mq = 0.265 GeV [30, 31]. Dashed
line: monopole ﬁt to lattice data extrapolated to mπ = 0.140
GeV as obtained in [23], arbitrarily extended in this ﬁg-
ure from −4 to −10 GeV2. Dot-dashed line: CCQM, cf Eq.
(26), corresponding to a CQ mass mq = 0.220 GeV and
mR = 1.192 GeV in the vertex (26) (recall that mR is ob-
tained by ﬁtting f exp
π = 0.0922 GeV [51]). Dotted line: as the
dot-dashed one, but with mq = 0.210 GeV and mR = 1.320
GeV. Double-dot-dashed line: as the dot-dashed one, but with
mq = 0.200 GeV and mR = 1.453 GeV. Experimental data:

Another interesting data set to be compared with is
π (−t),
given by the photon-pion transition form factor, F ∗
measured in the process γγ∗ → π0 [63,64]. Within
CCQM, only the LO asymptotic value of such transition
FF can be evaluated without adding new ingredients
(see, e.g., Ref. [65] for a wide discussion and references
quoted therein). As a matter of fact, one gets for high

exploited the ones shown in Tab. 2. It is worth notic-
ing that the lattice results are not too far from a phe-
nomenological estimate, < x >phe (µ = 2 GeV), that
one can deduce by applying a LO backward-evolution to
the value given in Ref. [12], < x >phe (µ = 5.2 GeV) =
0.217(11), obtained after a NLO re-analysis of the Drell-
Yan data of Ref. [11]. In particular, the phenomenolog-
ical value at µ = 2 GeV is

(61)

For the sake of completeness, it is interesting to quote

where Φ(ξmπ, κ⊥) is deﬁned in Eq. (23). The normaliza-
tion of φπ follows from Eq. (22). It should be anticipated
that CCQM results, both non evolved and evolved, as
shown in the next Fig. 3, resemble the asymptotic pion
DA obtained within the pQCD framework, i.e. φasy
π (ξ) =
6ξ(1 − ξ), that in turn yields (−t) F ∗
π (−t) → 2fπ, see
Refs. [66,67].

In what follows, the values mq = 0.220 geV and

mR = 1.192 GeV will be adopted.

5.1 Looking for the CCQM energy scale

As it is well-known, the em FF is not aﬀected by the
issue of the evolution, while the other quantities we are
interested in, namely the PDF and the GFFs (as well
as the DA, see Eq. (61)), have to be properly evolved.
A necessary step for going forward is to assign a
resolution scale to CCQM. In order to perform this
step, we have taken lattice estimates of the ﬁrst Mellin
moment of fN S(x, µ), whose evolution is determined
only by the quark contribution, as normalization of our
CCQM (roughly speaking). The starting point is the
calculation of both the unpolarized GPD, fN S(x) =
2H I=1(x, 0, 0), and the corresponding Mellin moments,
within our CCQM. In particular, these quantities are
shown in Table 1 up to n = 3. To emphasize that there
is no direct way to gather information about the energy
scale µ0, a question mark is put in the Table. In the

Table 1 Mellin moments of fN S(x) up to n = 3, evaluated
within the CCQM with the quark pion vertex given in Eq.
(26), mq = 0.220 GeV, and mR = 1.192 GeV. The energy
scale, µ0 has to be determined (see text).

Table 2 Recent lattice results results for the ﬁrst Mellin mo-
ment of the non singlet fN S(x), at the energy scale µLAT = 2

from unquenched lattice QCD calculations [14, 68], while the
second result has been obtained in Quenched lattice QCD
[69].

Refs. [68,69] and (ii) a very recent lattice estimate, re-
markably at the physical pion mass, giving < x >LAT

After establishing the set of lattice data, we need the
value of αLO
at µ = 2 GeV where Nf = 4. This value
has been obtained starting from αLO
(µ = 1 GeV) =
0.68183 obtained in Ref. [50]. Notice that at the scale
µ = 1 GeV only three ﬂavors are active. Then, by us-
ing mc = 1.4 GeV [50] and Eqs. (46) and (47), one
determines αLO
(µ = 2 GeV, 4) = 0.413 (notice that
quite similar results can be obtained by using the ap-
proach of Refs. [52,53]). Finally, paying attention to
the ﬂavor threshold, the lattice evaluations of the ﬁrst
moment M LAT
N S (1, µLAT ) have to be backward-evolved
up to a scale µ0, where they match our CCQM value,
i.e. we look for µ0 such that M LAT
N S (1, µ0) = 0.471 =

The results for µCCQ obtained from the above pro-
cedure, applied to the three lattice data, are shown in
Tab. 3 for mq = 0.220 GeV and mR = 1.192 GeV. In
particular, the values in the third column of Tab. 3 are
used in the next sections as starting values for the evo-
lution of both the non singlet PDF and the GFFs. The
diﬀerence between the three values of µ0 in the Tab. 3
is assumed as a theoretical uncertainty of our results.
To complete this subsection, in Tab. 4, the comparison
with the lattice calculation of Ref. [14] for the second
and the third Mellin moments is presented.

µ = 4 GeV from µ0 = 0.549 GeV. Dot-dashed line: PDF LO-
evolved at µ = 4 GeV from µ0 = 0.496 GeV. For details on
the values of µ0 see text and Tab. 3. Full dots: experimental
data at the energy scale µ = 4 GeV, as given in Ref. [11]

5.2 The evolution of the non singlet PDF and the
comparison with the experimental data

The non singlet PDF, as already explained, is the sim-
plest to be evolved since one does not need information
on the gluon distribution. The evolution has been per-
formed using the FORTRAN code described in [10] that
adopts a brute force method to solve the LO DGLAP
equation for the distribution xfN S(x), and it requests
as input the values of (i) µ, the ﬁnal scale, and (ii) the
initial ΛNf
QCD and µ0, as given in Table 3. It should be
pointed out an important detail in our calculations. For
all the values of µ0, the evolution has been performed
in two steps: ﬁrst xf CCQM
(x) has been evolved from
µ0 up to mc = 1.4 GeV and then from mc up to µ = 4
GeV, the energy scale of the experimental data [11].
This is necessary for taking into account the variation

QCD (µ = 2 GeV ) is 0.322
GeV) and consequently αLO
(µ).

In Fig. 2, the dashed line is the non evolved CCQM
calculation with mq = 0.220 GeV and mR = 1.192
GeV, while the solid and the dot-dashed lines corre-
spond to our evolved CCQM starting from the initial
scales µ0 = 0.549 GeV and µ0 = 0.496 GeV, respec-
tively. The diﬀerences between the evolved calculations
can be interpreted as the theoretical uncertainty of our
calculations. However it is very interesting that our LO-
evolved calculations nicely agree with the experimen-
tal data of Ref. [11] for x > 0.5 (see also the same
agreement achieved within the chiral quark model of
Ref. [56]). On the other hand, it has to be pointed out
that reﬁned calculations, like (i) the ones of Refs. [72,
73] based on the Euclidean Dyson-Schwinger equation
for the self-energy and (ii) the NLO calculation of Ref.
[74] based on a soft-gluon resummation, underestimate
the PDF tail of the experimental data from Ref. [11],
while agree with the analysis of the same experimen-
tal data carried out in Ref. [12], within a NLO frame-
work. The reanalysis of the experimental data leads to
a tail for large x that has a rather diﬀerent derivative
with respect to the original data from Ref. [11]. For the

DA φπ(ξ) = 6 ξ (1− ξ) (see, e.g., [66,67]) as the energy
scale increases. Analogous results are obtained within
the chiral quark model of Ref. [75].

5.3 The tensor GPD

We have extended to the tensor GPD our CCQM model
already applied to the vector GPD in Refs. [3,4], and
in Fig. 4, our ﬁnal results are shown for some values
of the variable ξ and t, but for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 (preliminary
results were presented in Refs. [8,9]). The GPD for neg-
ative values of x can be obtained by exploiting the fact
πT (x, ξ, t) is antisymmetric if x → − x, while
that EIS
EIV
πT (x, ξ, t) is symmetric (see, e.g. Ref. [5] for details).
It has to be pointed out that for ξ → 0 the valence com-
ponent is dominant (DGLAP regime) while for ξ → 1
the non valence term is acting (ERBL regime). In view
of that, it is expected a peak around x ∼ 1 for ξ → 1,
as discussed in Refs. [3,4] for the vector GPD.

It is worth mentioning that both isoscalar and isovec-
tor tensor GPD calculated within the chiral quark model
of Ref. [61] qualitatively show the same pattern (see
also Ref. [8] and reference therein quoted for a compar-
ison with results obtained within the LF Hamiltonian
Dynamics framework).

with lattice data

22(t, µ), Bq

10(t, µ) and Bq

The ﬁrst vector GFF Aq
10, i.e. the em FF, is experimen-
tally known, while the other GFFs can be investigated
only from the theoretical side. In particular, Aq
20(t, µ),
Aq
20(t, µ) have been calculated
within the lattice framework at the scale µ = 2 GeV
[13,15,16]. In this subsection, the comparison between
our CCQM predictions and the above mentioned lat-
tice evaluations is presented. It is important to notice
that other model calculations of both vector and tensor
GFFs are available in the literature (see, e.g., [60,61,
62,75,76,77]).

sake of completeness, in Fig. 3, the CCQM pion DA is
presented together with the results at the energy scale
µ = 1 GeV and µ = 6 GeV. It is worth noticing that
our CCQM evolves toward the pQCD asymptotic pion

To proceed, we have calculated both vector and ten-
sor GPDs, and then we have extracted the relevant
GFFs, by exploiting the polynomiality shown in Eqs.
(6) and (7) (see also [3]). The main issue to be ad-
dressed in order to perform the mentioned compari-
son with the lattice data is the evolution of our In the
simpler case, represented by the tensor GFFs, the LO
evolution of the quark contribution is uncoupled from
the gluon one. In particular, the two-step procedure
µCCQ → mc → µLAT has been adopted for evolving the
two transverse GFFs, Bq

At the valence scale, the gluon contribution is van-
ishing, and therefore one has < x >q= 1/2. Indeed,
the CCQM result amounts to < x > (µCCQ) = 0.47,
namely the momentum sum rule is not completely sat-
urated by the valence component at the CCQM scale
µCCQ. This diﬀerence originates from the fact that we
have a covariant description of the pion vertex, and
therefore we have not only a contribution from the va-
lence LF wave function (i.e. the amplitude of the Fock
component with the lowest number of constituents), but
also from components of the Fock expansion of the pion
state beyond the constituent one, like |q ¯q; q ¯q(cid:105). Without

one), Aq

and, accordingly, to evolve our CCQM results. In par-
ticular, since we have a multiplicative evolution, it is
suﬃcient (i) to evolve only the value at t = 0, namely
the ones collected in Tab. 6, through Eqs. (66), (67),
(68), (69), (74) and (79) and then (ii) to use Eq. (81).
As in the case of the evolution of the PDF, we con-
sidered the three possible values of µ0 listed in Tab. 3.
The results are shown in Tab. 7, together with lattice
data [13,16,78] and model calculations, obtained from
a chiral quark model [60,76] and an instanton vacuum
model [62]. It should be pointed out that within the
chiral perturbation theory (see Ref. [79]) one should
have the following relation between the so-called grav-

It should be pointed out that the GFFs Aq

by the value of t), given the absence of the gluon con-
tribution at the valence scale, viz

2i(t, µ) = Aq

From Eq. (81), one realizes that the ratio

Aq

2i(t, µ)/Aq

2i(t = 0, µ)

(Aq
2i(t = 0, µ) is also called charge) can be compared
with the same ratio obtained at a diﬀerent scale, e.g.
at µCCQ. It is understood that the same holds for the
tensor GFF. In Figs. 5 and 6, the tensor GFFs Bq
10(t)
and Bq
20(t), normalized to their own charges, are shown
for both the CCQM model, with mq = 0.220 GeV

16]. In particular the lattice data are represented by a
shaded area, generated by the envelope of curves that
ﬁt the lattice data with their uncertainties. In Refs. [13,
16], the lattice data have been ﬁrst extrapolated to the
physical pion mass through a simple quadratic (in mπ)
expression, and then ﬁtted by the following pole form

tion is veriﬁed by the lattice results, while CCQM does

diﬀers from < x > at µLAT (see Tab. 2), that contains
both quark and gluon contributions.

To have a better understanding of the quality of the
comparison between our CCQM results and the lattice
data shown in Tab. 7, we have added our calculation,
at t = 0, in Fig. 9, where the lattice results from [13],
extrapolated at the physical pion mass, are presented
for Aq
2,2(t, µLAT ). In Fig. 9, the stars
at t = 0 represent the CCQM values evolved at the
lattice scale (the size of the symbols is roughly pro-
portional to the uncertainties of the initial µCCQ (cf
subsec. 5.1), while the shaded area is the uncertain-

ties produced by the ﬁts to the lattice data, as elab-
orated in Ref. [13]. It is clear that in order to have a
conclusive comparison a more wide lattice data set is
necessary, but on the other hand it is impressive that
a small quantity, like Aq
2,2(t, µLAT ), can be extracted
with a quite reasonable extent of reliability. In Figs. 10
and 11, analogous comparisons for Bq
1,0(t = 0, µLAT )
and Bq
2,0(t = 0, µLAT ) are shown. In particular, Fig. 10
contains both B1,0(t = 0, µLAT ) and Bq

From the CCQM values evolved at µLAT , shown in Tab.
7, one can construct the shifts for n = 1, 2, and then
compare with the corresponding lattice results, as given
in Ref. [16]. In Tab. 8, the comparison is shown (recall
that Aq
1,0(t = 0) = 1). Obviously, the same observa-
tions relevant for Tab. 7 can be also repeated for Tab.
8, since it contains the same information but presented
in a diﬀerent context. The values shown in Tab. 8 in-
dicate that even the simple version of a CCQM is able
to reproduce a distortion of the transverse density in a
direction perpendicular to the quark polarization, and
in turn demonstrate the presence of a non trivial cor-
relation between the orbital angular momenta and the
spin of the constituents inside a pseudoscalar hadron,
that attracts a great interest from both experimental
and theoretical side (see, e.g., [20]).

6 Conclusions

A simple, but fully covariant constituent quark model
has been exploited for investigating the phenomenol-
ogy of the leading-order Generalized Parton Distribu-
tions of the pion. The main ingredients of the approach

comparison between values at t = 0 and physical pion
mass appears non trivial. In Fig. 11, a recent lattice
calculation of Bq
1,0(t = 0, µLAT ) [78] is compared with
our CCQM (triangles). In general, one has an overall
agreement, a little bit better for Bq

2,0(0).

The knowledge of GFFs allows one to investigate
the probability density ρn(b⊥, s⊥) for a transversely-
polarized u-quark (cf Eq. (12)). In particular, one can
address the 3D structure of the pion in the impact pa-
rameter space. For instance, one can calculate the aver-
age transverse shifts when the quark is polarized along
the x-axis, i.e. s⊥ ≡ {1, 0}. The shift for a given n is

Table 8 Mean shifts along the direction perpendicular to the u-quark transverse polarization, s⊥ ≡ {1, 0}, for n = 1, 2 (cf
Eq. (83)). The CCQM results have been constructed from the values in Tab. 7 (notice that the uncertainties are originated by
the three values listed there).

free parameter (the mass mq of the constituent quark,
since mR is constrained by fπ). It is worth noting that
the CCQM is elaborated in Minkowski space, and the
overall agreement we have shown with the lattice data,
obtained in Euclidean space, could be an interesting
source of information on the interplay of calculations
performed in the two spaces, with a particular attention
to the issue of the analytic behavior. In the future the
present model could be substantially improved by en-
riching the analytic structure of the pion BS amplitude
through a dynamical approach based on the solution of
the BSE via the Nakanishi integral representation [40]
(cf subsect 3.2), supplemented with a phenomenologi-
cal kernel. In perspective, given the simplicity and the
eﬀectiveness of the approach, one could aim at apply-
ing the same model to more complex hadrons than the
pion, e.g. to the nucleon within a quark-diquark frame-
work.

are (i) the generalization of the Mandelstam formula,
applied in the seminal work of Ref. [7] to matrix ele-
ments of the em current operator between states of a
relativistic composite system, and (ii) an Ansatz of the
Bethe-Salpeter amplitude for describing the quark-pion
vertex. Their combination produces a very eﬀective tool
that allows a careful phenomenological investigation of
the pion, as shown in detail through the evaluation of
both vector and tensor pion GPDs. We have also taken
into account, at the leading order, the evolution for ob-
taining a meaningful comparison with both experimen-
tal data (see Fig. 2 for the comparison with the PDF
extracted from the Drell-Yan data in Ref. [11]) and lat-
tice calculations of generalized form factors.

Summarizing, the CCQM proves to be quite sat-
isfactory in describing the pion phenomenology, espe-
cially considering that the model involves relatively sim-
