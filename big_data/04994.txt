ABSTRACT
We introduce a HST/STIS stellar census of R136a, the central ionizing star cluster of
30 Doradus. We present low resolution far-ultraviolet STIS/MAMA spectroscopy of
R136 using 17 contiguous 52×0.2 arcsec slits which together provide complete coverage
of the central 0.85 parsec (3.4 arcsec). We provide spectral types of 90% of the 57
sources brighter than mF555W = 16.0 mag within a radius of 0.5 parsec of R136a1,
plus 8 additional nearby sources including R136b (O4 If/WN8). We measure wind
velocities for 52 early-type stars from C iv λλ1548–51, including 16 O2–3 stars. For
the ﬁrst time we spectroscopically classify all Weigelt & Baier members of R136a,
which comprise three WN5 stars (a1-a3), two O supergiants (a5-a6) and three early
O dwarfs (a4, a7, a8). A complete Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the most massive
O stars in R136 is provided, from which we obtain a cluster age of 1.5+0.3
−0.7 Myr. In
addition, we discuss the integrated ultraviolet spectrum of R136, and highlight the
central role played by the most luminous stars in producing the prominent He ii λ1640
emission line. This emission is totally dominated by very massive stars with initial
masses above ∼ 100M⊙. The presence of strong He ii λ1640 emission in the integrated
light of very young star clusters (e.g A1 in NGC 3125) favours an initial mass function
extending well beyond a conventional upper limit of 100 M⊙. We include montages
of ultraviolet spectroscopy for LMC O stars in the Appendix. Future studies in this
series will focus on optical STIS/CCD medium resolution observations.

1 INTRODUCTION

The formation of massive stars remains an unsolved prob-
lem in astrophysics. This is especially challenging since very
massive stars (VMS, ≥ 100M⊙) are usually located within
young massive star clusters (≥ 104M⊙) with small core radii
(rc ∼ 0.1–0.2 pc, Portegies Zwart et al. 2010). The short
lifetime of such stars (2–3 Myr, Yusof et al. 2013) restricts
suitable Milky Way star clusters to only a handful, including
the Arches (Martins et al. 2008) and NGC 3603 (Schnurr et
al. 2008), both of which are highly reddened. Therefore, ob-
servations of young star clusters at ultraviolet wavelengths
– corresponding to the peak output of hot, luminous stars –
are largely restricted to extragalactic cases.

R136 was included in the census of optically bright Mag-
ellanic Cloud stars by Feast et al. (1960), and subsequently
resolved into three components, a, b and c (Feitzinger et al.
1980), with component a subsequently shown to be multi-
ple (Weigelt & Baier 1985). R136a is the closest example
of an extragalactic young massive star cluster (Hunter et
al. 1995). It is the central cluster of the NGC 2070 com-
plex within the 30 Doradus star forming region in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC, Massey & Hunter 1998; Doran et
al. 2013), and is relatively lightly reddened, facilitating study
at ultraviolet wavelengths (de Marchi et al. 1993). However,
the 0.1 pc core radius of R136a (Portegies Zwart et al. 2010;
Selman & Melnick 2013) subtends only 0.41′′ at the 50 kpc
distance to the LMC (Pietrzynski et al. 2013), which led to
the cluster at one time being mistaken for a ≥1000 M⊙ star
(Cassinelli et al. 1981, Feitzinger et al. 1983), although Wal-
born (1973) had earlier predicted that R136a would have a
structure analogous to the core of NGC 3603. Consequently,
observations at high spatial resolution are required to re-
solve individual stars within the core of R136a, requiring
either Hubble Space Telescope or large ground-based tele-
scopes with adaptive optics (VLT/MAD: Campbell et al.
2010).

The star-formation history of NGC 2070 has recently
been investigated by Cignoni et al. (2015) using Hubble
Tarantula Treasury Project (HTTP) imaging, revealing an
upturn in star formation ∼7 Myr ago, peaking 2–3 Myr ago,
and a total stellar mass of 9×104M⊙ assembled within 20
pc of R136. The mass function for intermediate- and low-
mass stars in R136 have been obtained from HST imaging
(Hunter et al. 1995; de Marchi et al. 2011). However, the
colour/reddening degeneracy of hot massive stars at ultra-
violet and optical wavelenths necessitates spectroscopy for
robust physical properties, and in turn, masses, measuring
present-day mass functions (though see Ma´ız Apell´aniz et
al. 2014). To date, Koornneef & Mathis (1981) and Vacca et
al. (1995) have presented UV scans across NGC 2070 with
the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE), while UV spec-
troscopy of individual stars of R136a has been limited to the
brightest members with HST/GHRS (de Koter et al. 1997,
1998).

Meanwhile, Massey & Hunter (1998) have obtained op-
tical spectroscopy for dozens of stars within NGC 2070 us-
ing HST/FOS, which revealed large numbers of very early
O stars, indicating a young cluster age (<1–2 Myr). More
recently Schnurr et al. (2009) used VLT/SINFONI to ob-
tain spatially resolved K-band spectroscopy of the bright-
est sources, namely R136a1, a2, a3 and c, which are WN-

type emission-line stars. Analysis of the VLT and HST spec-
troscopy plus VLT/MAD imaging led Crowther et al. (2010)
to conclude that such stars possess very high (initial) stellar
masses of 160–320 M⊙, results largely supported by Besten-
lehner et al. (2011) and Hainich et al. (2014).

The existence of such high-mass stars in R136 chal-
lenges the previously accepted ∼ 150M⊙ upper stellar mass
limit (Figer 2005), unless they are products of stellar merg-
ers (Banerjee et al. 2012; Schneider et al. 2014a). If such
stars are indeed merger remnants one would expect younger
apparent ages for this with respect to lower mass stars, and
diﬀerences in the present day mass function with respect to a
Salpeter slope (Schneider et al. 2014a; Schneider et al. 2015).
Massey & Hunter (1998) suggested that the mass function of
R136 is normal, although their study only included a subset
of the brightest stars in the vicinity of R136a.

A census of the hot, luminous stars in R136a with STIS
is the focus of the present series of papers. We discuss the
suitability of ultraviolet spectroscopy for spectral classiﬁca-
tion of O stars, based in part upon spectroscopic datasets
in the usual blue visual wavelength range. Wind velocities
for O stars can uniquely be obtained from P Cygni proﬁles
in the far-UV (e.g. Groenewegen et al. 1989, Prinja et al.
1990). Comparisons of empirical (reduced) wind momenta1
with theoretical predictions usually rely on approximate v∞
calibrations (e.g. Lamers et al. 1995). Indeed, high quality
far-UV spectroscopy has been restricted to relatively few
LMC O stars to date (Prinja & Crowther 1998; Walborn et
al. 1995; Massey et al. 2005). One byproduct of the present
study is a calibration of wind velocities for (mostly) early O
dwarfs at the ∼ 0.5Z⊙ metallicity of the LMC.

In the ﬁrst study in this series, we introduce our new
STIS observations of R136a in Sect. 2. We present and
analyse ultraviolet STIS/MAMA spectroscopy of individual
stars in Sect. 3, including approximate spectral types and es-
timates of terminal wind velocities. An ultraviolet spectral
atlas of LMC O stars is compiled using literature spectra,
in a few instances complemented with new STIS/CCD spec-
troscopic datasets to provide templates of missing spectral
types. The current dataset also allows the contributions from
individual stars to its integrated ultraviolet spectrum to be
quantiﬁed. This is discussed in Sect. 4, of relevance for other
young massive star clusters in the local universe (e.g. Chan-
dar et al. 2004; Leitherer et al. 2011) and the integrated
rest-frame ultraviolet spectrum of high redshift star forming
galaxies (e.g. Shapley et al. 2003). Finally, brief conclusions
are drawn in Sect. 5.

2.1 Ultraviolet spectroscopy

We have obtained ultraviolet STIS/G140L spectroscopy us-
ing the far-UV Multi-Anode Microchannel Array (MAMA)
detector and a 52×0.2 arcsec slit at 17 contiguous point-
ings in R136, identiﬁed by their position within the cluster,
namely SE9, SE8, . . . SE1, NW1, . . . NW7, NW8 (Fig 1). The
spectral coverage of the G140L grating is λλ1150–1700˚A,
with a pixel scale of 0.6˚A/pixel, and notional point source
resolving power of 1250 at λ=1500˚A. Since the MAMA plate
scale is 0.024 arcsec/pix, a slit length of ∼25 arcsec is sam-
pled in all cases. All MAMA exposures were obtained in two
visits, 4 and 5 from GO 12465, totalling 6 orbits, as set out
in Table 1. All observations were obtained at a ﬁxed posi-

tion angle 64◦ (E of N), to ensure that R136a1 and R136a2
lie within the same slit position (NW1) as shown in Fig-
ure 1. For each visit the nearby isolated star Melnick 34 was
acquired using the CCD and F28X50LP aperture, followed
by a peakup with the CCD and 52′′×0.′′1 aperture, followed
by an oﬀset to individual pointings, with two exposures ac-
quired per pointing, the second spatially oﬀset along the slit
by 11 pix (0.27 arcsec), with integration times shown in Ta-
ble 1.

MAMA exposures were combined and extracted us-
ing the specialised stistools package (Bostroem & Prof-
ﬁtt 2011). No automated wavelength correction was made
for sources not centred in individual slits while standard

axis runs from top to bottom (horizontal line near top is geocoronal Lyα emission, occulting bar lies to the right of each image) and the

calstis slit loss corrections were applied. Therefore, abso-
lute wavelength scales may be incorrect by up to ±2 pix
(0.56˚A/pix) while absolute far-UV ﬂuxes will be underesti-
mated by up to a factor of two in extreme cases.

Extractions were also independently made using mul-
tispec (Ma´ız Apell´aniz 2005; Knigge et al. 2008) which is
particularly suited to the crowded region at the geomet-
ric centre of the cluster. Figure 2 shows two dimensional
spectral datasets for particularly crowded slits NW1 (a1, a2
and a5) and NW3 (a4 and a8), including collapsed spectral
images between λλ1475–1525. multispec extractions relied
upon empirical point spread functions for G140L/MAMA
spectroscopy employing the position of individual sources in
slits from short exposure HST WFC3/UVIS F336W imag-
ing of R136 from Oct 2009 (for details see de Marchi et al.

2011). The latter provided wavelength corrections if sources
were not centred in individual slits, but a standard slit loss
correction is again adopted.

For relatively isolated sources, calstis and multispec
extractions agree extremely well, while the latter approach
usually performed better in situations where sources were
closely spaced within individual slits. For consistency, spec-
troscopic datasets presented here were extracted with mul-
tispec, except for R136 H70, 141, 149 for which multispec
extractions were problematic.

0.′′2 slit at identical positions and position angle (or PA +
180◦) to the UV spectroscopy, although the coarser plate
scale of 0.05 arcsec/pix provided complete spatial coverage
of the slit length. In total, two exposures at four grating po-
sitions with the G430M grating provided complete blue cov-
erage λλ3793-4849˚A, with a pixel scale of 0.28˚A/pixel, and
point source resolving power of 7700 at λ=4400˚A. A single
grating position with the G750M grating provided λλ6482–
7054˚A spectroscopy, with a pixel scale of 0.56˚A/pixel, and
point source resolving power of 6000 at Hα. For all CCD
observations, the second exposure was oﬀset spatially along
the slit by 7 pix (0.35 arcec). Three of the four G430M ob-
servations were taken over the course of a few days, with
the fourth (G430M/4194) obtained approximately 6 months
later to enable to search for low period binaries. All G750M
exposures were taken at a single epoch.

In total CCD exposures were split between 7 visits dur-
ing Cycle 19 (GO 12465, 26 orbits), plus 2 visits during Cycle
20 (GO 13052, 7 orbits), also set out in Table 1. multispec
and calstis extractions of CCD observations will be the fo-
cus of the next paper in this series (Caballero-Nieves et al.
2016, in prep).

LMC stars that have been observed in the UV and for
which reliable optical classiﬁcations are available are fairly
scarce. Our sample allows 10 stars with robust optical classi-
ﬁcations spanning the full O2–O9.5 subtype sequence, which
are included here as LMC templates (see Sect.3).

2.3 Stellar census of R136

Hunter et al. (1995) have used HST/WFPC2 to identify the
visually brightest sources in R136, while deeper HST/WFC3
images have been analysed by de Marchi et al. (2011) to
derive multicolour photometry. We compare WFPC2 and
WFC3/UVIS photometry in F336W, F555W and F814W
ﬁlters for all sources in common within 10 arcsec (2.4 pc)
of R136a1 in Fig. 3. Overall, the earlier WFPC2 results are
conﬁrmed by WFC3, albeit with modest systematic oﬀsets of
mF336W(WFPC2) – mF336W(WFC3) = +0.15 ± 0.20 mag,
mF555W(WFPC2) – mF555W(WFC3) = +0.17 ± 0.21 mag,
mF814W(WFPC2) – mF814W(WFC3) = +0.18 ± 0.22 mag.

In sources for which de Marchi et al. (2011) photometry is
unavailable, we have substituted Hunter et al. (1995) results
to which these oﬀsets have been applied. Overall, agreement
between early WFPC2 and new WFC3 photometry is gener-
ally very good, with a few notable exceptions – WFC3 pho-
tometry from de Marchi et al. (2011) is signiﬁcantly brighter
for R136a1, a2 and a6.

In Table 2 we provide a catalogue of all 55 sources within
2.05 arcsec (0.5 pc) of R136a1 brighter than mF555W =
16.0 mag, while a further 8 bright sources observed with
STIS/MAMA are presented in Table 3. Additional sources
brighter than mF555W = 17.0 mag within 4.1 arcsec (1 pc)
are listed in Appendix D (Table D1). There is evidence for a
non-standard extinction law in 30 Doradus, and signiﬁcant
variation thereof (Ma´ız Apell´aniz et al. 2014). Speciﬁcally for
R136, Doran et al. (2013) favoured RV ∼ 4.2 mag for individ-
ual stars based on a combination of optical (WFC3/UVIS)
and near-IR (VLT/MAD, Campbell et al. 2010) photome-
try. We have applied chorizos to 41 O stars with WFC3
photometry and approximate spectral types, and obtained
good ﬁts in 34 cases, from which average values of R5495
= 4.1±0.5 and AF555W = 1.72±0.25 mag is obtained, in
good agreement with the Tatton et al. (2013) near-IR study,
for which AV = 1.75 mag was inferred for R136. Here, we
adopt tailored extinctions of WN5 stars from Crowther et
al. (2010), while for the O stars we adopt a reddening law
of R5495 = 4.1 and individual extinctions based upon tem-
perature dependent F336W – F555W intrinsic colours from
multicolour chorizos (Ma´ız Apell´aniz 2004):

(mF336W − mF555W)0 = −1.475 − 0.155(Teﬀ /10000K)mag,

plus AF555W = R5495EF336W−F555W/2.28 from the Seaton
(1979)/Howarth (1983) LMC extinction law, plus an LMC
distance modulus of 18.49 mag (Pietrzynski et al. 2013). For
stars without UV derived spectral types, we adopt O6 V (Teﬀ
= 39,900 K) for stars brighter than mF555W = 16.0 mag, and
O9.5 V (Teﬀ = 32,900 K) for fainter stars. We adopt AF555W
= 1.72 mag for all sources without WFC3 photometry.

Severe crowding results in signiﬁcant diﬀerences in pho-
tometry between Hunter et al. (1995) and de Marchi et al.
(2011) for some of the brightest sources in the core of R136a.

HST/WFC3 photometry implies F336W/F555W/F814W
ﬂux ratios of 0.88/0.95/0.84 for a2/a1, while K-band
VLT/SINFONI observations favour a signiﬁcantly lower ra-
tio of 0.76 (Crowther et al. 2010). From our STIS/MAMA
spectroscopy, the 1500˚A ﬂux ratio inferred from the mul-
tispec extraction is lower still (0.56), while Gaussian ﬁts
to spatial proﬁles in our 2D ultraviolet NW1 dataset (lower
left panel in Fig. 2) favour 0.62. We adopt this ﬂux ratio, so
ma1
F555W = 0.52 under the reasonable assumption
that their interstellar extinctions are equivalent. From com-
parison between the UV ﬂuxes of a1 and a2 and relatively
isolated sources in the NW1 slit, we support WFC3/F555W
photometry of a1, resulting in a revised a2 apparent mag-
nitude of mF555W = 12.80 mag in Table 2. This leads to
a downward revision of 0.18 dex in stellar luminosity, and
corresponding 20% lower mass estimate.

F555W − ma2

F555W − ma6

In addition, WFC3 photometry of a6 from de Marchi
et al. (2011) is signiﬁcantly brighter than Hunter et al.
(1995). From our MAMA SE1 dataset, we obtain a 1500˚A
ﬂux ratio of 0.70 for a6/a3,
in perfect agreement with
ma3
F555W = –0.38 from WFC3, so adopt photom-
etry from de Marchi et al. Finally, de Marchi et al. (2011)
provide a single photometric measurement for a4+a8, which
agrees satisfactorily with the combination of these sources
in Hunter et al. (1995). Again, we utilise UV datasets (lower
right panel in Fig. 2) to verify their relative ﬂuxes. From
our multispec extraction we obtain a 1500˚A ﬂux ratio of
0.66 for a8/a4, in good agreement with 0.65 from Gaus-
sian ﬁts to their spatial proﬁles in the NW3 slit. We obtain
ma4
F555W = 0.46, again assuming identical inter-
stellar extinctions for these stars. From the combined WFC3
photometry of ma4+a8
F555W = 13.41±0.01, we obtain revised a4
and a8 apparent magnitudes of mF555W = 13.91 and 14.42
mag (Table 2).

3 SPATIALLY RESOLVED

FAR-ULTRAVIOLET SPECTROSCOPY

We have classiﬁed individual R136 stars, based upon a com-
parison between their ultraviolet morphology and LMC tem-
plate stars with reliable optical classiﬁcations. As noted
above, we have incorporated 10 reference O2–O9.5 stars
based on optical classiﬁcations provided in Caballero-Nieves
et al. (2016, in prep) which are indicated in Table 2–3. Our
approach therefore complements the UV clasiﬁcation system
of LMC OB stars by Smith Neubig & Bruhweiler (1999) us-
ing IUE SWP/LORES spectroscopy. We adopt existing (op-
tical) subtypes for the three WN5 stars in R136a (Crowther
& Dessart 1998).

In addition to the point sources, a signiﬁcant fraction
of the far-UV spectrum of the central parsec of R136 arises
from the intra-cluster background, on the basis of the multi-
spec ﬁts to the 100 brightest cluster members. This is illus-
trated in Fig. 4, and represents a combination of unresolved
cluster members plus extended emission from bright clus-
ter stars originating in adjacent slits. In Fig. 5, we present
the far-UV spectra from the sum of selected background re-
gions of SE3 (1′′ E of R136a1) and SE4 (0.7′′ SE of R136a1),
reminiscent of R136 H70 (O5 Vz), except for extended He ii
emission originating from either R136a1 or a2. ∼20% of the
integrated far-UV continuum arises from the diﬀuse back-

Figure 3. Comparison between WFPC2 (Hunter et al. 1995) and
WFC3/UVIS photometry (de Marchi et al. 2011) for all sources
in common within 10 arcsec of R136a1 (O stars: triangles, WN
stars: squares) for F336W (top), F555W (middle) and F814W
(bottom). Agreement is generally excellent aside from R136a1,
a2 and a6 (see Sect. 2.3).

mF555W = 16.0 mag). References to optical (literature) spectral types are provided in Table 3. F1500 ﬂuxes are averages for the range
1500±25˚A. Aside from the WN5 stars (Crowther et al. 2010), temperatures and luminosities are from spectral type calibrations (Doran et
al. 2013), while inferred current masses M and ages τ for O stars are from bonnsai (Schneider et al. 2014b) using the Bonn evolutionary
models (Brott et al. 2011; K¨ohler et al. 2014). Velocities include vedge, vblack and v∞ (colons indicate less secure values).

3.1 UV morphology of O stars in the LMC

Walborn et al. (1985) have previously presented an atlas
of O stars based on IUE/HIRES spectroscopy. The over-
whelming majority of these stars are located in the Milky
Way. More recently, Walborn et al. (1995, 2002a, 2004) have
presented HST and FUSE ultraviolet spectroscopy of Mag-
ellanic Cloud O stars, although subtypes and luminosity
classes are poorly sampled. Since then, a number of HST pro-
grammes have obtained ultraviolet spectroscopy for a range
of LMC O stars (e.g. Massey et al. 2004, 2005, 2009). In Ap-
pendix A we present a montage of ultraviolet spectroscopic
sequences for dwarfs, giants and supergiants (Figs. A1-A4),
with luminosity sequences shown in Figs. A5–A11. A log of
observations of these datasets is presented in Table A1.

MNRAS 000, 1–39 (2015)

Figure 5. Intra-cluster far-UV spectra of selected inner regions
from SE3 and SE4 slits, in close proximity (0.7–1′′, solid) to
R136a1 together with R136 H70 (O5 Vz, dotted) for reference.
Extended He ii λ1640 emission from R136a1 is apparent in the
extracted background spectra.

There is a clear variation in UV morphology amongst
O stars from early to late subtypes and from dwarf to
supergiant, although we wish to highlight wind line pro-
ﬁle variation at an individual subtype/luminosity class. By
way of example, we present C iv λλ1548–51 P Cygni line
proﬁles amongst six O4–5.5 dwarfs in the LMC in Fig. 6.
Both LH81/W28-5 and R136 H78 possess saturated P Cygni
(black) absorption troughs, whereas other stars possess shal-
low extended absorption troughs which may be ﬂat (e.g. Sk–
70◦ 60, LH 58–496, Sk–70◦ 69) or deeper at high velocities
(R136 H70). Within this sample, P Cygni emission compo-
nents are relatively weak, with the exception of Sk–70◦ 69
for which C iv emission is very prominent.

This variation indicates (at least) a third parameter af-
fecting the wind proﬁles beyond ionization and luminosity
class. While further investigation is required, it may well be
age, i.e. evolutionary distance from the ZAMS, since some of
these stars are in very young regions. While LH 81/W28–5
does have a strong He ii λ4686 absorption line (Massey et
al. 2004, their Fig 17), it is substantially weaker than He ii
λ4541, indicating a higher luminosity and/or stronger wind

than for typical class V. It is well known that mass-loss rates
of O stars at a given temperature and luminosity span a wide
range of values (Hillier et al. 2003). Binaries and/or binary
evolution may also be relevant contributors to this diversity.

3.2 UV morphology of stars in R136

In Appendix B we present a series of montages of ultraviolet
spectroscopy of stars in R136 (Figs. B1-B9), together with
UV templates where appropriate.

In Figure B1 we present HST/STIS spectroscopy of the
three luminous WN stars R136a1, a2 and a3 (Crowther et
al. 2010). These stars have previously been observed in the
ultraviolet with HST/GHRS (de Koter et al. 1997), although
a1 and a2 were blended in the GHRS SSA 0.22′′ entrance
aperture. Our long-slit STIS spectroscopy was obtained at a
position angle of 64◦ and extracted with multispec to disen-
tangle a1 from a2. Nevertheless, the ultraviolet morphologies
of all WN stars are extremely similar to one another, as is
the case optically (HST/FOS, de Koter et al. 1997) and in
the near-IR (VLT/SINFONI, Schnurr et al. 2008). We in-
clude an IUE/LORES spectrum of R146 (Brey 88, WN5)
for comparison.

In Figure B2 we present HST/STIS spectroscopy of two
Of/WN stars, Melnick 37 and Sk–67◦ 22, together with a5
and b. R136a5 has previously been observed in the ultravi-
olet by HST/GHRS and classiﬁed as O3f/WN (de Koter et

al. 1994). From optical HST/FOS spectroscopy R136a5 has
been assigned O3 If/WN (Massey & Hunter 1998) or O2 If*
(Crowther & Walborn 2011). The closest LMC analogue to
R136a5 in the ultraviolet is Sk–67◦ 22 (O2 If/WN5). R136b
has also previously been observed with HST/GHRS (GO
6018/Heap) while Massey & Hunter (1998) assigned O4 If+
from HST/FOS spectroscopy (see also Crowther & Wal-
born 2011). From STIS/CCD spectroscopy the ratio of N iv
λ4058/N iii λλ4634-41 is characteristic of O4 and WN8 sub-
types (rather than O3.5 and WN7) so O4 If/WN8 is newly
inferred here. He ii λ1640 and Si iv λλ1394-1402 P Cygni
proﬁles are much stronger in R136b than for conventional
LMC O4 supergiants (e.g. Sk−65◦ 47, Fig. A8).

HST/STIS spectroscopy of O2–3 (super)giants in R136
is presented in Fig. B3, including the LMC O2–3 III and
O2 If reference stars R136 H48 and H36, from our new
STIS/CCD dataset. Massey & Hunter (1998) previously as-
signed O3 III for H48 while Walborn et al. (2002b) assigned
O2–3 If for H36. The O2 supergiant classiﬁcation of R136a6
is new here, with R136 H46 and H47 assigned O2 III-If, ow-
ing to their morphological similarity to the candidate run-
away star VFTS 16 (Evans et al. 2010). Another example of
a O2–3 III star is observed beyond the central parsec, namely
R136 H102 located 4.8 arcsec to the NE.

Figure B4 presents STIS/MAMA spectroscopy of 8
O2–3 V stars in R136 together with the templates BI 237
(O2 V) and R136 H35 (O3 V) based on our new STIS/CCD
datasets. All stars exhibit prominent O v λ1371 absorp-
tion, P Cygni C iv λλ1548–51, N v λλ1238–42 and negligi-
ble/weak absorption at He ii λ1640. Of these, six stars have
previously been spectroscopically observed with HST/FOS
by Massey & Hunter (1998), who assigned O3 V or O3 III
classiﬁcations. R136a4, a8, H31, H50 and H62 are newly
classiﬁed as O2–3 V in this study.

HST/STIS spectroscopy of 7 UV-classiﬁed O3–4 dwarfs
in R136 is presented in Fig. B5 together with the reference
stars R136 H35 (O3 V) and H78 (O4 V) from our STIS/CCD
spectroscopy. All O3–4 dwarfs possess weak O v λ1371 ab-
sorption, plus prominent, albeit unsaturated C iv λλ1548–
51 P Cygni proﬁles (Fig. A6). Of these, four have previously
been spectroscopically observed by Massey & Hunter (1998),
who assigned O3 V, except for R136a7 for which O3 III
was proposed from HST/FOS spectroscopy. R136 H86 and
H149 are newly classiﬁed here as O3–4 V from STIS/MAMA
datasets, although the latter, centrally located in the SE2
slit, suﬀers from signiﬁcant He ii λ1640 contamination by
R136a3 (SE1).

Figure B6 presents STIS/MAMA spectroscopy for
dwarf O4–5 stars in R136 together with new templates R136
H78 (O4 V) and H70 (O5 V) from new STIS/CCD observa-
tions. We favour O4 V for R136 H65, H71, H75, H89 and
H90 from their morphological similarity to H78, while O4–
5 V is preferred for H45, H49, H94 and H119. Classiﬁcations
are in good agreement with Massey & Hunter (1998) who
proposed O3 V for H45, H49 and H94, O5 V for H90 and
O3–6 V for H71. Figure B7 extends this sequence to O5 V
and O6 V subtypes, exploiting a STIS/CCD subtype of H123
(O6 V). We propose O5 V subtypes for H64 and H69, O6 V
subtypes for H30, H77 and H92, and O5–6 V for H141, again
in reasonable agreement with Massey & Hunter (1998) who
adopted O7 V for H30 and H64, O3–6 V for H69, O3 V for
H92. Massey et al. (2002) obtained O5.5 V+O5.5 V for H77.

The UV morphology of R136 H68, located 4.6′′ from R136a1,
is also consistent with O6 V.

Figure B8 presents STIS spectroscopy for O7–8 dwarfs
in R136, exploiting new optical subtypes of O7 V and O8 V
for R136 H134 and H80, respectively. All stars are newly
classiﬁed except for H112, for which Massey & Hunter
(1998) proposed O8.5 III. A very weak wind signature of C iv
λλ1548–51 is observed, via either very shallow P Cygni ab-
sorption or a clear blueshifted absorption. We assign O9+ V
subtypes for the ﬁnal group of stars, presented in Figure B9,
for which solely photospheric C iv λλ1548–51 absorption is
observed, in common with H121 for which O9.5 V is ob-
tained from our STIS/CCD spectroscopy. Low S/N becomes
increasingly problematic for these stars, whose far-UV ﬂuxes
are typically F1500 ∼ 10−14 erg s−1 cm−2 ˚A−1 or lower.

Of the remaining stars within 2.05 arcsec of R136a1
that are listed in Table 4 two lie beyond our HST/STIS
slit spectroscopy, namely R136 H39 and H137, of which H39
has been observed previously by Massey et al. (2002) and
classiﬁed O3 V+O5.5 V. Finally, H186 lies close to a much
brighter source (H86), within its slit, so we are unable to
isolate its UV spectrum.

3.3 Wind velocities for R136 stars

The presence of strong, saturated P Cygni proﬁles amongst
the O stars of R136a allows us to measure their wind veloc-
ities. To date, wind velocities for large numbers of Galactic
OB stars have been obtained from IUE SWP/HIRES spec-
troscopy (Prinja et al. 1990; Howarth et al. 1997), whereas
wind velocities for O stars in the Magellanic Clouds have
been relatively scarce (e.g. Prinja & Crowther 1998; Massey
et al. 2004, 2005).

Here we measure the maximum blueward extend of sat-
urated P Cygni absorption lines (usually C iv λλ1548–51),
vblack, and use it as a probe of terminal wind velocity, i.e.
v∞ = vblack (Prinja et al. 1990). The velocity at which the
violet absorption meets the continuum, the edge velocity
vedge, is usually larger than vblack as a result of turbulent mo-
tions in the outﬂow. Such stochastic motions cause some of

stars with saturated P Cygni proﬁles (top), unsaturated P Cygni
proﬁles (centre) and non-P Cygni proﬁles (bottom). Proﬁles are

the material to move at speeds beyond the local ﬂow speed,
hence will cause absorption beyond the terminal speed if the
line is fully saturated. If P Cygni proﬁles are not fully sat-
urated v∞ can be approximated as a function of vedge (see
below). In such cases the terminal velocity could be under-
estimated because the ion may no longer be present in the
outer wind.

We measure vblack and/or vedge with respect to (LMC)
interstellar absorption lines C iv λλ1548–51 and/or Si ii
λ1527 (e.g. Howarth & Phillips 1986). The systemic ra-
dial velocity of R136 is ∼268 km s−1 (H´enault-Brunet et al.
2012). Individual measurements should be reliable to ±100
km s−1, so v∞ should be accurate to ±200 km s−1.

For the present sample, C iv λλ1548–51 exhibits one
of three spectral morphologies. A signiﬁcant subset, typi-
cally O2–4 stars and supergiants, exhibit saturated P Cygni
proﬁles, from which vblack (and vedge) can be measured, as
shown for R136 H36 in the top panel of Figure 7. A fur-
ther subset possess strong P Cygni proﬁles, albeit without
saturated absorption features, from which vedge can be mea-

sured, typical of O5–6 dwarfs, as shown for R136 H70 in
the central panel of Fig. 7. O7–8 dwarfs tend not to exhibit
prominent P Cygni proﬁles, but some show blue absorption
that are suﬃciently distinct from interstellar C iv, as shown
in the lower panel of Fig. 7 for H80.

Individual results are presented in Table 4. The highest
terminal wind velocities are v∞ ∼ 3500 km s−1 for the O2
(super)giants H36 and H46, while late O dwarfs often pos-
sess vedge ≤ 1500 km s−1, or no wind measurements are pos-
sible. Figure 8 shows edge and black velocities for 28 R136
stars, from which we obtain vblack/vedge = 0.8 ± 0.05, which
is adopted to estimate wind velocities for stars in which
solely edge velocities are measured. For reference, Prinja &
Crowther (1998) obtained vblack/vedge ∼ 0.7 for LMC stars
and vblack/vedge ∼ 0.9 for 6 R136 stars (in common with the
present sample).

In Table 6 average values of wind velocities in R136 are
provided for O2–3, O3–4, O4–5, O5–6, O7–8 dwarfs, plus
early O giants and supergiants, including cases for which
wind velocities are based upon v∞ = (0.8 ± 0.05)vedge.
Amongst dwarfs, the trend towards lower wind velocities
for later subtypes is apparent. The standard deviation at
O5–6 is unusually large since individual estimates span a
wide range from 1510 km s−1 (H77, O6 V from UV mor-
phology) to 2580 km s−1 (H69, O5 V from UV morphology).
Statistics of wind velocities for ’ﬁeld’ O stars elsewhere in
the LMC are included, drawn from Walborn et al. (1995),
de Koter et al. (1998), Prinja & Crowther (1998), Massa
et al. (2003), Massey et al. (2004, 2005, 2009), Evans et al.
(2010) and Bestenlehner et al. (2014), with individual mea-
surements from the literature and comparisons with present
results provided in Table C1 in Appendix C.
1400 km s−1

for R136b
(O4 If/WN8) is extremely low, even with respect to O2–
3.5 If/WN stars in the LMC (Table C1). In contrast, O2–3
supergiants within R136 possess higher wind velocities than
dwarfs, which is the reverse of O2–3 stars elsewhere in the
LMC, albeit based on low number statistics. For complete-
ness, we obtain an average wind terminal velocity of 2475 ±
110 km s−1 for the three WN5 stars within R136a. Crowther
et al. (2010) obtained v∞ = 2200 − 2600 km s−1 for these
stars from their UV to near-IR spectroscopic analysis.

The wind velocity of

Our new dataset eﬀectively double the sample of LMC
early O stars with measured wind velocities. It is important
to note that a range of wind velocities have been obtained
for individual stars. In part this arises from the methodol-
ogy, either direct measurement as applied here or line ﬁt-
ting based on the Sobolev with Exact Integration method
(SEI, Groenewegen & Lamers 1989). Still, diﬀerent authors
applying the same approach to the same dataset have ob-
tained signiﬁcantly diﬀerent wind velocities. By way of ex-
ample, de Koter et al. (1998) obtained v∞ = 3000 km s−1
from HST GHRS spectroscopy of R136a5, while Massey et
al. (2004) obtained 3400 km s−1 from the same dataset; we
ﬁnd 3045 ± 200 km s−1 from STIS spectroscopy. Mindful
of concerns about systematic diﬀerences between alterna-
tive approaches, an SEI analysis of H36 was carried out
(R.K. Prinja, priv. comm.) revealing v∞ = 3500 km s−1,
vturb/v∞ = 0.15 for a β=1 velocity law, in agreement with
the vblack result. This does not imply that all such measure-
ments will be entirely consistent, although it does suggest
that there is no inherent systematic oﬀset.

Figure 8. Comparison between edge and black velocities (in
Mm s−1) for R136 WN (stars), Of/WN (squares), (super)giants
(triangles) and dwarfs (circles), together with the best ﬁtting
vblack = (0.8 ± 0.05)vedge relationship for those stars without
saturated black absorption troughs (solid line).

Despite the low number statistics, wind velocities of O2–
4 dwarfs in R136 are somewhat lower than elsewhere in the
LMC. By way of example, the average wind velocity of 8
R136 O3–4 dwarfs is 2525 km s−1, versus 2900 km s−1 for
5 counterparts elsewhere in the LMC (and 3040 km s−1 for
Galactic O3–4 dwarfs). The reason for this is not clear, if not
simply due to small sample sizes. If physical, it is likely not
the result of a lower metallicity in 30 Doradus (v∞ ∝ Z 0.13:
Leitherer et al. 1992) relative to the rest of the LMC, al-
though youth may be a factor, recalling the discussion linked
to Figure 6.

Wind velocities for individual R136 stars are presented
as a function of stellar temperature in Fig. 9, based on UV-
derived subtypes and the temperature calibration of LMC
O stars of Doran et al. (2013), in which results from vblack
(ﬁlled symbols) and vedge (open symbols) are distinguished.
We have included average UV-derived wind velocities for
Galactic O stars from Prinja et al. (1990) – based on the
same methodology as used here – updated for O2–4 stars
following Walborn et al. (2002b), and adopting the Martins
et al. (2005) Galactic observational temperature calibration
adapted for LMC O stars by Doran et al. (2013).

To date, comparisons of empirical (reduced) wind mo-
menta of O stars with theoretical predictions either adopt
wind velocities or are based on calibrations. Pre-empting our
stellar mass estimates from Section 3.4, we are able to com-
pare terminal wind velocities with escape velocities. Lamers
et al. (1995) obtained v∞/vesc = 2.65 ± 0.2 for 16 Galac-
tic O stars earlier than O7. From 35 O2–6 stars in R136,
we ﬁnd v∞/vesc = 2.5 ± 0.4, in agreement with the Galac-
tic sample. Therefore, although R136 early O stars possess
∼15% lower wind velocities than Galactic counterparts, the
ratio v∞/vesc is unchanged. Still, considerable variation is

al. 2014).

3.4 Physical parameters for R136 stars

De Koter et al. (1998) provided UV-derived parameters of
the brightest dozen or so members in R136, while Massey
& Hunter (1998) provided a more complete Hertzsprung-
Russell diagram from HST/FOS spectroscopy. Since then,
Doran et al. (2013) have provided updated physical param-
eters for stars within R136 using contemporary calibrations
for O stars in the LMC, based on the Galactic scale from
Martins et al. (2005).

We defer more robust R136 O-type classiﬁcations un-
til future papers in this series, but already our UV mor-
phological classiﬁcation allows us to present a preliminary,
near complete Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for luminous
stars within a radius of 2.5 arcsec (0.6 parsec) of R136a1.
Temperatures and bolometric corrections of O stars are
adopted from Tables 5–7 of Doran et al. (2013), while prop-
erties of Of/WN stars are adopted from their Appendix A.
HST/WFC3 photometry (de Marchi et al. 2011), except in
particularly crowded regions (recall a1/a2, a4/a8), and in-
terstellar extinctions provide absolute magnitudes as set out
in Sect. 2.3.

In Figure 10 we present the ﬁrst spectroscopically-
derived Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for stars brighter than
mF555W = 16.0 mag within 0.6 pc from R136a1. A dotted
line corresponding to mF555W = 16.0 mag for an adopted
AF555W = 1.72 mag is indicated, highlighting the region

ther optically-derived (ﬁlled) or UV-derived (open) spectral types
using the temperature calibrations from Doran et al. (2013). LMC
isochrones for slowly rotating stars (veq = 100 km s−1) at ages of
0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 Myr are overlaid (solid), together with individ-
ual tracks for 25, 40, 60, 100 and 200 M⊙ stars (dashed), from
Brott et al. (2011) and K¨ohler et al. (2015). Representative un-
certainties are indicated in the lower left. A dotted line marking
mF555W = 16.0 mag for an adopted AF555W = 1.72 mag is in-
dicated, emphasising that our census is sensitive to all luminous
stars in R136a.

where our sample is complete. A total of 25 stars (26 in-
cluding R136c), mostly early O dwarfs, are more massive
than ∼50 M⊙. The remaining stars are mid to late O dwarfs
with initial masses above ∼20 M⊙.

3.5 Ages and masses of individual stars in R136

LMC isochrones for rotating stars with veq = 100 km s−1
from Brott et al. (2011) and K¨ohler et al. (2015) are in-
cluded, together with tracks for non-rotating 25, 40, 60, 100
and 200 M⊙. These tracks were selected as respresentative
since they closely match the average rotation rate of O stars
in 30 Doradus (Ram´ırez-Agudelo et al. 2013), though do not
diﬀer signiﬁcantly from non-rotating models. It is apparent
that, R136b aside, all stars with initial masses above 100
M⊙ lie between the 0–1 Myr isochrones, whereas stars with
masses between 40–100 M⊙ span 0–2.5 Myr, and those be-
low 40 M⊙ typically span 0–4 Myr, although uncertainties
in physical parameters do not exclude ages below ∼2 Myr,
with the exception of R136 H73 (O9+ V) for which an age
of ∼5 Myr is favoured.

For quantitative mass and age determinations we have

exploited bonnsai

from comparison between UV-estimated temperatures and
luminosities and evolutionary models, involving two key pri-
ors: a Salpeter mass function and an adopted rotation dis-
tribution of O stars from VFTS (Ram´ırez-Agudelo et al.
2013). Individual age and mass estimates are presented in
Table 4, and include results for the WN5h stars solely based
upon their positions in the HR diagram, i.e. for consistency
initially neglecting their He-abundances.

As suggested by Fig. 10, application of the Bonn evo-
lutionary models (via bonnsai) to the three WN5h stars
implies very young ages of ≤0.3 Myr in all cases. Low initial
rotation rates – favoured by observations of O stars in 30 Dor
(Ram´ırez-Agudelo et al. 2013) – will lead to a redward evolu-
tion on the main sequence in evolutionary models, so young
ages are required to explain the blue location of the WN5h
stars. The next most luminous stars are extreme O super-
giants, R136a5 (O2 If/WN5), a6 (O2 If) and b (O4 If/WN8),
each with current masses of 100–150 M⊙, plus O2–3 V stars
R136a4 and a8. Once again, young ages of 0.6±0.3 Myr are
inferred for these stars, with the exception of R136b whose
lower temperature suggests an age of ∼1.5 Myr. Schnurr et
al. (2009) have previously argued that R136b, oﬀset by a
projected distance of 0.5 pc is more evolved than other core
members of R136 (though see Appendix of Hainich et al.
2014).

Consequently, the HR diagram positions of the WN5h
stars and the most luminous O stars in R136a favours very
young ages. However, it should be emphasised that envelope
inﬂation is implemented in the Bonn models, which is most
pronounced for the most massive models (≥ 50M⊙), since
these lie closest to the Eddington limit (Sanyal et al. 2015).
Inﬂation moves isochrones to lower temperatures, such that
younger ages are inferred for stars with models accounting
for inﬂation, compared with those that do not.

Turning to the lower mass stars, all O2–6 stars lie be-
tween the 0–3 Myr isochrones in Fig. 10, although all stars
do not lie along a single isochrone. This is unsurprising given
the approximate physical parameters of individual stars, ini-
tial rotation rate distributions, and uncertain binarity. For
an extreme mass ratio system, the primary would completely
dominate the spectrum of the system, so its location in the
HR diagram would not be signiﬁcantly displaced. In con-
trast, for a mass ratio of unity, individual stars would lie 0.3

dex lower in the HR diagram than the composite system, so
the age would be overestimated. The eﬀect would be mod-
est for the highest mass systems at very young ages, but
would become more signiﬁcant for lower mass systems. In-
deed, later O stars possess higher age estimates (3–6 Myr),
although the inferred properties for such stars are least se-
cure of the entire sample.

Our STIS/CCD datasets will help identify close binaries
in R136 (Caballero-Nieves et al. 2016, in prep), while new
HST Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS) observations – currently
being analysed (GO 13477, PI, S.E. de Mink) – seek to reveal
binaries with separations down to 0.02′′ (1000 AU), following
on from Cycle 3 FGS observations of R136 (Lattanzi et al.
1994).

Individual age estimates follow solely from the posi-
tion of stars in the HR diagram. We are in the process
of analysing STIS/CCD datasets of R136a members, from
which rotational velocities and helium abundances can be
obtained. For the moment, He abundances for the WN5h
stars are available (Crowther et al. 2010). From their lu-
minosities and He-rich atmospheres, we can infer minimum
ages since the surface helium mass fraction sets a lower limit
to the core helium mass fraction. The minimum ages of
R136a1–3 are 1–1.3 Myr, in reasonable agreement with re-
sults for the O stars. In order to simultaneously reproduce
the high surface temperatures of the WN5hs stars, Bonn evo-
lutionary models favour rapid initial rotation (∼400 km s−1),
and ages of 1.1–1.6 Myr, as shown in Table 7. These re-
sults compare favourably with Crowther et al. (2010) who
applied Geneva evolutionary models for very massive stars
(Yusof et al. 2013), also requiring rapid rotation (vrot/vcrit
= 0.4 or vrot ∼ 400 km s−1) and ages of ∼1.5 Myr (see Ta-
ble 7). Details of the Bonn and Geneva codes diﬀer signiﬁ-
cantly regarding the consideration of mixing, core overshoot-
ing and the treatment of envelope inﬂation. Both employ
the metallicity-dependent Vink et al. (2001) prescription for
mass-loss on the main-sequence, so estimates of Minit from
current luminosities ought to be consistent, even if there
are uncertainties in their validity for very massive stars (see
Crowther et al. 2010; Gr¨afener & Vink 2013).

Figure 11. Probability density distribution of the apparent ages
of UV-derived spectral types of individual O stars (excluding
R136a1, a2, a3) based on bonnsai (Schneider et al. 2014b) and
main-sequence evolutionary models (Brott et al. 2011; K¨ohler et
al. 2015), favouring an age of 1.5+0.3
−0.7 Myr. The shaded area is a
bootstrapped ±1σ estimate of the age distribution.

3.6 R136 cluster age and mass

Early estimates of the age of R136 were 3–4 Myr on the basis
that the WN stars were classical He-burning stars. Subse-
quently, a lower age of <1–2 Myr was obtained once it was
recognised that the WN stars are core H-burning stars, sup-
ported by a rich early O-type population (de Koter et al.
1998, Crowther & Dessart 1998). The most extensive study
of massive stars to date has been by Massey & Hunter (1998)
who inferred a very young age of ≤1 Myr using the Vacca
et al. (1996) O star temperature scale, or ≤2 Myr from the
Chlebowski & Garmany (1991) scale, although the majority
of their sample was drawn from the R136 region, rather than
R136a itself.

Here, we have combined the age estimates of 52 O stars
in R136a (excluding WN5h stars) from bonnsai to produce
a probability density distribution, presented in Fig. 11, from
which an age of 1.5+0.3
−0.7 Myr is obtained. The ±1σ estimate
represents the standard deviation in each bin of the age dis-
tribution computed with a bootstrapping method. As dis-
cussed above, lower ages are obtained for the highest lumi-
nosity stars, although the treatment of envelope inﬂation for
the most massive stars (≫ 50M⊙) remains uncertain.

Discrepant age estimates for massive stars in other
young massive star clusters (e.g. Arches and Quintuplet in
Galactic Centre) have been obtained from their Wolf-Rayet
and O star contents, in the sense that the luminous WR stars
possess apparent ages which are younger than O stars by 1–2
Myr (Martins et al. 2008; Liermann et al. 2012). Schneider et
al. (2014a) have interpreted this as rejuvenation of the most
massive stars through stellar mergers. Banerjee et al. (2012)
have suggested the very luminous WN5h stars in R136 are
post-merger systems. If this were the case, one might antici-
pate younger (apparent) age estimates for these rejuvenated
stars with respect to the massive O star population.

R136 diﬀers from the Quintuplet and Arches clusters in
the sense that the luminous O stars also appear young, yet
the He-enrichment of WN5h stars favours ages of ∼1.5 Myr

MNRAS 000, 1–39 (2015)

and unusually rapid rotation, the latter predicted by stellar
mergers (de Mink et al. 2013). According to Schneider et
al. (2014a), the probability that the most massive star in a
5×104M⊙ star cluster is a binary product rises from 50% at
1 Myr to 100% at 3 Myr. However, only the most massive
system is anticipated to have merged after 1.5 Myr (4 are
anticipated after 3 Myr) for a Salpeter-type mass function
in the core. Therefore, the youth of R136a does not support
a scenario in which all the very massive stars are merger
products. Indeed, as we discuss below, the mass within the
central parsec is signiﬁcantly lower than 5×104M⊙ further
strengthening this conclusion. A more deﬁnitive answer to
this question is deferred until the analysis of STIS/CCD
datasets, but the apparent youth of the most luminous stars
likely arises from the treatment of inﬂation in single star
models than the physics of binary mergers.

A variety of mass estimates of R136 have been obtained.
Hunter et al. (1995) infer a mass of 2.2 × 104M⊙ for stars
with > 2.8M⊙ out to a radius of 5 pc from HST/WFPC2,
suggesting a total mass of ∼ 5 × 104M⊙, while Andersen et
al. (2009) derived a mass of 5 × 104M⊙ down to 2.1 M⊙ out
to a radius of 7 pc from HST/NICMOS. The actual mass of
the R136 cluster may be somewhat lower, as it may suﬀer
contamination from the surrounding halo of NGC 2070, for
which Cignoni et al. (2015) infer a global mass of 9×104M⊙.
Indeed, the two components contribute equally to the sur-
face brightness at a radius of ∼5 pc from R136a1 according
to Mackey & Gilmore (2003).

For a total cluster mass of 5 × 104M⊙, an Initial Mass
Function following Kroupa (2001) with an upper mass limit
of 300 M⊙, we would anticipate 104/1250 = 40 stars with
initial masses in excess of 50 M⊙. Since only 25 stars with
such high masses are observed within the central 0.5 pc
radius, the actual R136a cluster mass may be somewhat
lower. Of course, some massive stars may have been ejected
from the cluster (e.g. VFTS 16, Evans et al. 2010). Fujii &
Portegies Zwart (2011) suggest a few percent of stars with
∼ 50M⊙ would be dynamically ejected from dense clusters
of this mass. If we were to consider a radius of 5 pc, analo-
gous to the region surveyed by Hunter et al. (1995), there are
another ∼30 stars with masses in excess of 50 M⊙ (from the
census of Doran et al. 2013), supporting their high enclosed
mass for the R136 ‘region’.

Sabbi et al. (2012) have proposed that R136 forms
part of an ongoing merging binary cluster system within
NGC 2070, on the basis of a clump of older stars located ∼5
pc to its NE (see also Cignoni et al. 2015). If this clump were
to reﬂect stars in the process of dynamically accreting, one
might expect older stars to have already merged with R136
itself (see Gieles 2013). Indeed, some of the apparently older
O stars in R136 (e.g. R136 H73) may arise from this clump,
although the determination of physical parameters for these
late-type O stars awaits detailed spectroscopic analysis of
our optical STIS/CCD datasets. The evolutionary status of
some stars in the NE clump (e.g. Mk 33Sb, WC5) implies an
apparent age of 3–4 Myr, providing these are coeval (Mel-
nick 1985; Walborn & Blades 1997). The age of this region
may be higher, should the highest luminosity stars be reju-
venated binary products.

3.7 Census of very luminous stars in 30 Doradus

Doran et al. (2013) have undertaken a study of the massive-
star content of 30 Doradus, together with the contribution of
R136 to the ionizing and mechanical feedback of the entire
star forming region, albeit reliant upon an incomplete census
of R136 itself. We are now able to reassess the total number
of very luminous stars in 30 Doradus, updated to include
tailored parameters of massive stars from Bestenlehner et
al. (2014) based on VFTS observations (Evans et al. 2011).
Table 8 lists 29 stars within 30 Doradus which are more
luminous than log(L/L⊙) ≈ 6.2, corresponding to initial
masses of ∼ 100M⊙ or more for zero age main-sequence
stars. Only 9 (31%) of the most luminous stars in 30 Doradus
lie within R136 itself!

A similar number (10) of very luminous stars are located
in the halo around R136, at projected distances of 1.5–5 pc3
The other (11) high luminosity stars in 30 Doradus lie ≥10
pc away from R136a1, approximately half within NGC 2070
and the remainder elsewhere. The majority of these are lu-

3 We have excluded VFTS 512 (O2 V) from the Doran et al.
(2013) statistics since the luminosity obtained by Bestenlehner et
al. (2014) is log(L/L⊙) = 6.0. Source 1222 from Parker (1993)
has also been excluded owing to its O9 V spectral type from
Walborn et al. (2002c), as has VFTS 1014 (Parker 863) despite
Bestenhehner et al. obtaining log(L/L⊙) = 6.2 since this ARGUS
spectrum is likely composite (O3 V + mid/late O). Similarly, we
favour the lower luminosities (log L/L⊙) = 6.0 – 6.1) inferred by
Doran et al. (2013) for R140a2 (WN5+O), Mk 49 (WN6) and
BAT99-96 (WN8) over those by Hainich et al. (2014), who ob-
tained signiﬁcantly higher values by assuming the WR dominated
the continuum ﬂux (R140a2) or on the basis of high interstellar
extinctions (Mk 49, BAT99-96).

minous WN-type stars (see also Hainich et al. 2014; Besten-
lehner et al. 2014).

The overwhelming majority of the very massive stars
in 30 Doradus are early O supergiants, transition Of/WN
stars or luminous WN stars. Crowther et al. (2010) proposed
that very massive stars may possess O-supergiant spectral
appearances on the main sequence, owing to their proximity
to the (classical) Eddington limit. However, R136 a4, a8 and
Mk 25 indicate that very luminous O2–3 dwarf stars do exist
despite having classical Eddington parameters of Γe ∼0.5,
based upon bonnsai-derived masses.

4 INTEGRATED FAR-ULTRAVIOLET

SPECTROSCOPY

Ultraviolet spectroscopy of the central region of NGC 2070
was ﬁrst obtained with IUE (e.g. Koornneef & Mathis 1981;
Vacca et al. 1995), while the advent of HST/GHRS permit-
ted high resolution spectroscopy (Walborn et al. 1992). The
integrated R136 spectrum revealed prominent He ii λ1640
emission, together with strong N v λλ1238–42 and C iv
λλ1548–51 P Cygni features, with stellar Si iv λλ1393–1402
absent.

Figure 12 presents the integrated far-UV spectrum of
R136 considering all sources up to 0.5 pc from R136a1.
Its appearance closely reﬂects earlier descriptions, He ii
λ1640 emission is relatively strong (Wλ ∼ 4.5˚A) and broad
(FWHM∼10˚A or 1800 km s−1), so the integrated spectral
morphology is closer to an Of/WN supergiant than a gen-
uine WN star - recall Figure 4 of Walborn et al. (1992)
which compares R136a to Melnick 42 (O2 If). A comparison
between the 2×2 arcsec aperture GHRS/G140L observation
of R136a from April 1991 (GO 1188, PI D.C. Ebbetts) and

an equivalent region of our STIS dataset reveals excellent
agreement, and is morphologically identical to the integrated
spectrum shown in Fig. 12 aside from a 30% lower contin-
uum ﬂux.

Fig. 12 includes the co-added spectrum of all 70 stars for
which F1500 ≥ 5 × 10−15 erg s−1 cm2 ˚A−1, which collectively
contribute ∼77% of the integrated continuum ﬂux, with the
diﬀerence resulting from UV faint late O-type stars, plus the
unresolved early B population. The cumulative spectrum of
the 7 most luminous members of R136a – each with inferred
initial masses in excess of 100 M⊙ – comprising three WN
stars (a1–a3), one Of/WN star (a5), an O2 supergiant (a6)
plus two O2–3 dwarfs (a4, a8) – is also included in Fig. 12.
Collectively, these most closely resemble a weak lined mid-
WN integrated star. It is apparent that the He ii λ1640 emis-
sion line ﬂux, and one third of the continuum ﬂux originates
from these few stars, the former dominated by R136a1–a3.

MNRAS 000, 1–39 (2015)

Figure 13. Cumulative F1500 ﬂux for the brightest 70 far-UV
sources within 2.05 arcsec (0.5 pc) of R136a1, including esti-
mates for stars beyond our slit spectroscopy. The three WN stars
R136a1–a3 contribute 20% of the total, while collectively the 18
brightest far-UV sources provide 50% of the integrated continuum
ﬂux.

The remaining 63 far-UV bright stars cumulatively resemble
an early non-supergiant O star, with prominent O v λ1371,
and P Cygni N v λλ1238–42, C iv λλ1548–51.

It is apparent that prominent He ii λ1640 emission
in R136 arises from the presence of VMS (initial masses
≥ 100M⊙). Usually, the upper mass limit assumed in pop-
ulation synthesis models is 100 M⊙ so a synthetic model
for R136 would fail to reproduce its He ii λ1640 emission.
Indeed, if this feature is observed in the integrated light of
suﬃciently young (unresolved) high mass star clusters, one
might legitimately conclude that the stellar mass function
extends well beyond 100 M⊙.

At very young ages, early O stars will dominate the
UV appearance of massive clusters, so strong O v λ1371
absorption will be present. The absence of mid to late O
supergiants will ensure that P Cygni Si iv λλ1393–1402 is
absent. At later ages (3–5 Myr) O v will weaken while Si iv
will strengthen, plus He ii λ1640 from classic WR stars will
appear. Therefore, the simultaneous presence of O v absorp-
tion, He ii emission together with the absence of P Cygni
Si iv would suggest both a very young age and the presence
of very massive stars. To date, the most promising example
of such a star cluster is A1 within NGC 3125 (Chandar et
al. 2004; Hadﬁeld & Crowther 2006; Woﬀord et al. 2014).

In addition, since our datasets enable spatially resolved
spectroscopy of the constituents of R136, we are able to
quantify the contribution of individual stars to the inte-
grated UV continuum. 5 stars brighter than mF555W = 17.0
mag located within 2.05 arcsec of R136a1 lie beyond our
STIS slit spectroscopy, so we have estimated their ﬂuxes by
adopting an average F1500/FF555W ratio from cluster mem-
bers; they are presented in parentheses in Tables 4 and B1.
We estimate ∼2% of the integrated UV ﬂux originates from

18

these stars, primarily R136 H39 (O3 V+O5.5 V, Massey et
al. 2002).

Figure 13 presents the cumulative 1500˚A ﬂux of R136a
to a radius of 0.5 pc, versus a ranked list of the 70 far-UV
brightest stars in this region. The three brightest sources
alone (R136a1-a3) contribute 20% of the far-UV continuum
ﬂux, while the 18 brightest far-UV sources provide 50%
of the integrated far-UV ﬂux. Walborn et al. (1992) cite
an higher (pre-COSTAR) estimate of 40% for R136a1-a3
from GHRS acquisition images, according to D. Ebbets and
E. Malumuth.

5 SUMMARY

We have introduced a census of the visually brightest
members of the R136 star cluster based on new long-slit
HST/STIS spectroscopy. We have obtained ultraviolet, blue
visual and Hα spectroscopic datasets using 17 contiguous
52×0.2′′ slits sampling the core of R136. In the present study
we reveal the following:

(i) We classify 51 of the 57 stars brighter than mF555W =
16.0 mag within a radius of 0.5 pc of R136a1 based on their
ultraviolet spectroscopic morphology. We conﬁrm previous
results of Massey & Hunter (1998) that the bulk of the vi-
sually brightest members of R136 are O2–3 stars. For the
ﬁrst time we classify all Weigelt & Baier (1985) stars within
R136a, which comprise three WN5 stars (a1-a3), two O su-
pergiants (a5-a6) and three early O dwarfs (a4, a7–a8). Eight
additional sources are spectrally classiﬁed within the central
∼pc, including R136b (O4 If/WN8).

(ii) We obtain wind terminal velocities from measure-
ments of vblack (or vedge) from P Cygni C iv λλ1548–51 pro-
ﬁles, from which we obtain average O2–3 wind velocities of
2750 and 3120 km s−1 for dwarfs and (super)giants, respec-
tively. Comparisons with early O dwarfs elsewhere in the
LMC and Milky Way indicate somewhat lower wind veloci-
ties in R136.

(iii) We estimate physical parameters for the visually
brightest members of R136 based on the temperture cali-
bration of LMC O-type stars from Doran et al. (2013) and
exploit bonnsai (Schneider et al. 2014b) to estimate masses
and ages based on rotating evolutionary models appropri-
ate for the LMC (Brott et al. 2011, K¨ohler et al. 2015).
Three WN stars (R136a1-a3), two Of/WN stars (R136a5
and R136b), newly identiﬁed O2 If R136a6 and O2–3 V stars
R136a4 and a8 possess initial masses ≥100 M⊙.

(iv) We obtain a cluster age of 1.5+0.3

−0.7 Myr from the O
star content, which is consistent with that estimated for
the luminous WN5h stars by Crowther et al. (2010), al-
though apparent ages of these and other luminous O stars
is 0.6±0.3 Myr, likely to arise from the treatment of en-
velope inﬂation in evolutionary models (Sanyal et al. 2015),
rather than rejuvenation following binary mergers. The mass
and youth of R136a indicate that no more than the most
massive system is potentially a binary product (Schneider
et al. 2014a). More deﬁnitive conclusions await analysis of
STIS/CCD spectroscopy, permitting rotation rates and He
abundances of O stars to be obtained. We identify 25 stars
more massive than 50 M⊙ within 0.5 pc of R136a1 indicat-
ing a lower enclosed mass than previous estimates, although
reasonable consistency is achieved with respect to Hunter

et al. (1995) and Andersen et al. (2009) in the R136 ‘re-
gion’ from the total number of high mass stars within a 5
pc radius.

(v) Incorporating results from our earlier VFTS-based
census (Doran et al. 2013; Bestenlehner et al. 2014) we es-
timate a total of 29 stars more luminous than log(L/L⊙)
= 6.2 in the entire 30 Doradus nebula, of which 26 possess
O2–4 If, Of/WN or WN subtypes. Only 9 stars are located
within R136 itself, with an additional 9 stars within the ex-
tended halo, 1.5–5 pc away from R136a1 (Melnick 1985) and
another 11 stars at much greater distance (10–120 pc).

(vi) We have also considered the integrated ultraviolet
spectrum of R136a in the context of its constituent members.
The prominent He ii λ1640 emission feature arises primarily
from the most massive stars. Speciﬁcally, close to 100% of
the He ii λ1640 ﬂux and 32% of the far-UV continuum orig-
inates in the 7 stars for which we estimate (initial) masses
above 100 M⊙, the former dominated by from R136a1–a3.
Usually, such stars are neglected in conventional population
synthesis models. Prominent He ii λ1640 emission in the in-
tegrated spectrum of suitably young star clusters – promi-
nent O v λ1371 absorption without strong Si iv λλ1393-
1402 P Cygni emission – would favour a mass function
that extends well above this value. Indeed, extremely strong
λ1640 emission in cluster A1 within NGC 3125 favours ex-
tremely massive stars therein (Chandar et al. 2004; Hadﬁeld
& Crowther 2006; Woﬀord et al. 2014).

In future papers in this series we will present the cor-
responding blue, visual and Hα STIS/CCD spectroscopic
datasets. These will be used to reﬁne spectral classiﬁca-
tions, obtain more robust physical and wind properties, and
search for close binary systems. These will enable a re-
ﬁned Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for R136a. The multi-
epoch nature of the CCD datasets will enable an attempt
at identifying close binaries (see Cottaar & H´enault-Brunet
2014), together new HST FGS observations of R136a (S.E.
de Mink, P.I.).

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

APPENDIX A: ULTRAVIOLET ATLAS OF LMC
O STARS

In this appendix we present an ultraviolet atlas of LMC O
stars, primarily obtained with the FOS or STIS instruments
of Hubble Space Telescope. A log of observations is presented
in Table A1, with morphological sequences for O dwarfs, gi-
ants and supergiants presented in Figs. A1–A4. Luminosity
sequences for O2 – O9+ stars are presented in Figs A5-A11.
More extensive IUE SWP/LORES atlases for LMC OB stars
are presented by Smith Neubig & Bruhweiler (1999).

Table D1. HST/WFC3 photometry (de Marchi et al. 2011) for additional R136 sources brighter than mF555W = 17.0 mag within a
projected distance of 4.1 arcsec (1 parsec) from R136a1. Identiﬁcations are from Weigelt & Baier (1985, WB85) or Hunter et al. (1995,
HSH95). AF555W is calculated from observed colours for an adopted reddening law of R5495 = 4.1, and DM = 18.49 (Pietrzynski et al.
2013). F555W-band photometry shown in italics is from Hunter et al. (1995) oﬀset by –0.17 mag (see Sect. 2.3). R136 H351 is included
since it is one of the 70 far-UV brightest sources in R136a1.
