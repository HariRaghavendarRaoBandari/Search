Abstract

Since the time of the original Greenwood & Williamson paper, it was
noticed that abrasion and wear lead to possibly bimodal distribution of
asperity height distribution, with the upper tail of asperities following
from the characteristics of the process. Using a limit case solution due to
Borucki for the wear of an originally Gaussian distribution, it is shown
here that the tail is indeed always Gaussian, but with diﬀerent equiva-
lent parameters. Therefore, if the wear process is light, one obtains a
bimodal distribution and both may aﬀect the resulting contact mechanics
behaviour. In this short note, we illustrate just the main features of the
problem. We conclude that it is an oversimpliﬁcation to consider surfaces
Gaussian.

1 Introduction

From the times of the celebrated Greenwood and Williamson (1966) paper,
we know that surfaces that have been worn or abraded show a non-unique
Gaussian distribution.
Indeed, Fig.6 of GW (adapted here as Fig.1) shows
in a Gaussian paper the distribution of summit heights in a surface of mild
steel which had been abraded and then slid against copper, which resembles a
”bimodal Gaussian”. More precisely, Greenwood & Wu 2001 returned to that
very surface and commented that Fig.6 of GW paper ”shows an abraded surface
which is largely ﬂat but where the heights of the upper 80% may be regarded
as Gaussian. (We may note that ‘proper’ statistical tests would not reveal this
fact)”.

Fig.1 - Height distribution of an abraded surface (adapted from Greenwood

and Williamson 1966).

On more careful consideration therefore, the surface had been largely worn
out, but this may not be always the case. Today, we can gather a lot more
insights into the process of wear or abrasion from the models developed, using
GW description of roughness, in the context of Chemical Mechanical Polishing
used for planarization of integrated circuits (Borucki, 2002, Borucki et al. 2004,
Shi & Ring 2010). Indeed, polishing causes high asperities wearing faster than
low asperities. Assume an original distribution of asperities, φ0 (z) which is
taken to be Gaussian (but we postpone the term √2π into the integrals for easy
of notation)

φ0 =

z 2

, φ0 = exp(cid:20)−

where σ is the rms amplitude of the summit heights.

Using Archard law for wear and the GW model, an equation similar to
a diﬀerential Hamilton-Jacobi equation was obtained for the distribution of
asperity heights which tends to develop very high peaks in the tail and indeed
in the case when the separation between the polishing pad and the surface is
kept constant at z = c, an analytical solution is developed with the method of

, with ca = kV and k is the wear constant, while V is sliding

speed. Further, E∗ is elastic modulus of materials, and R the radius of asperity
summits. As Borucki et al (2004) clearly state:- ”this solution develops an inte-
grable singularity at z = d representing the portion of the pad-surface that has
been worn smooth by the wafer. After a suﬃciently long but ﬁnite time, this
singularity converges to a δ−distribution with its amplitude approaching a lim-
iting value given by the fraction of the pad-surface originally protruding above
the wafer height”. We need to take this carefully in consideration when develop-
ing a contact mechanics model. Before we do that, let us move to dimensionless
form,

This function is plotted in Fig.2 for representative dimensionless time t =

We can integrate analytically the diﬀerence between the Borucki distribu-
tion, and the original Gaussian one, to ﬁnd the fraction of asperities worn out

which we shall assume, in the absence of a better hypothesis, all lye on the
z = c, and, perhaps an even stronger assumption, maintain the same radius.
Obviously if special experimental setups will permit to have reasonably simple
alternative assumptions, they could be readily incorporated.

Therefore, the so-modiﬁed Borucki distribution is

and load, integrating for the distribution of asperity heights, we obtain for the

3 Results

The results are quite as expected. Fig.3 plots the integrals I B

for the same case of Fig.2. Starting with the integral giving the number of
asperities in contact, it is clear that, at the ”jump” c = 1.5, we recover the
number of asperities in the unworn proﬁle, by construction. Upon increasing
the wear time, the tail is worn out increasingly. Looking now at Fig.3b, this
integral is proportional to the contact area, and, as in Fig.3c, a change of slope
results in moving across the jump, but not an actual jump as in the number of
asperities in Fig.3a.

which for the unworn given Gaussian system, would be relatively constant with
separation. Fig.4 shows that the pressure is indeed more or less constant for
any system, despite the constant changes with time, decreasing as long as the
process continues – this is mainly due to the fact that the ”eﬀective” roughness is
reduced in the tail of the distribution, because of wear. On the other hand, if the
contact moves to separations lower than c = 1.5, then the mean pressure tends to
restore rather quickly its original Gaussian value — it doesn’t do immediately
so because the asperities have now moved to a lower height, and therefore,
with respect to the unworn case, they are compressed of a much lesser amount,
resulting in less pressure. Obviously this suggests that for the procedure to
really work at constant separation c, the total load would need to decrease
according to the model prediction.

4 Conclusions

We have shown in a simple case, that wear or abrasion leads to continuous
change of roughness parameters, which aﬀect the response of the rough contact.
In cases when the process is selectively acting on part of the asperity distri-
bution, the eﬀects are clearer, and a bimodal distribution results. It may be
therefore be an oversimpliﬁcation to consider surfaces Gaussian, as if coming
simply from a single distribution.
