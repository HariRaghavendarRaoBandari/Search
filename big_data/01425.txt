Abstract

In the present paper the representation of the virtual braid group V Bn into the auto-
morphism group of free product of the free group and free abelian group is constructed.
This representation generalizes the previously constructed ones. The fact that these al-
ready known representations are not faithful for n ≥ 4 is veriﬁed. Using representations of
V Bn, the virtual link group is deﬁned. Also representations of welded braid group W Bn
are constructed and the welded link group is deﬁned.

Introduction

The Artin representation [5, Corollary 1.8.3] of the braid group by automorphisms of the
free group allows to solve the word problem in the braid group, to construct the linear repre-
sentations of the braid group (the Burau representation) as well as the linear representation of
pure braid group (the Gassner representation) etc. The virtual braid group (see [23], [11]) is
one of generalizations of the classical braid group. A natural question about the representation
of the virtual braid group by automorphisms of some group arises.

For each virtual braid the virtual link could be constructed. Contrary to the classical link
case there is no natural deﬁnition of a virtual link group. The following question arises: to
deﬁne the virtual link group.

There exist several approaches to determine the group of virtual knots and links. The
ﬁrst deﬁnition was given by L. Kauﬀman [11] in 1996. Next there was the deﬁnition by V.
Manturov [16] (see also [4], where the same groups were deﬁned using the virtual braid group
representation by automorphisms of a free group). Further there was the deﬁnition by D. Silver
and S. Williams [21]-[22] and lately another version by H. Boden, E. Dies, A. Gaudreau, A.
Gerlings, E. Harper, A. Nicas [6].

The fact that all representations known before are not faithful for n ≥ 4 will be shown in
the present work. A new representation which generalizes all previous ones will be suggested.

Moreover the fact that the new representation is equivalent to the extension of the Artin
representation of the braid group will be shown. Using the new representation the virtual link
group is deﬁned and the fact that it is the virtual link invariant is proved. There will be shown
the fact that for the classical link the constructed group is isomorphic to the free product of
the fundamental group of the link complement in the tree dimensional sphere and some free
abelian group.

The principally new way to the deﬁnition of the virtual link group was suggested in the
paper of J. Carter, D. Silver and S. Williams [7] where the virtual link group was deﬁned as
the fundamental group of the complement of some classical link in a thickened surface. In the
present work there will be shown that the group of virtual trefoil deﬁned in [7] is not isomorphic
to the group of virtual trefoil deﬁned using the representation of virtual braid group .

Authors are grateful to Oleg Chterental who pointed out an element in the kernel of the

Artin representation of the virtual braid group (see [8]).

§ 1. The braid group, the virtual braid group and the welded braid group

In the paper the following notations are used. If a and b are elements of some group G, then

ab = b−1ab is conjugacy of a by b; [a, b] = a−1b−1ab is the commutator of elements a and b.

The braid group. Recall that the braid group Bn on n strands, where n ≥ 2, is deﬁned

by generators σ1, σ2, . . . , σn−1 and deﬁning relations

σiσi+1σi = σi+1σiσi+1

σiσj = σjσi

for i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 2,
for |i − j| ≥ 2.

(1)
(2)

There exists a homomorphism of the group Bn on the permutation group Sn that maps the
generator σi into the transposition (i, i + 1), i = 1, 2, . . . , n−1. The kernel of this homomorphism
is the pure braid group and is denoted by the symbol Pn. The group Pn is generated by elements
aij, 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n, which can be expressed through the generators of Bn in the following way

ai,i+1 = σ2
i ,

j σ−1
j−1.
The group Pn composes in the semi direct product of free groups

aij = σj−1σj−2 . . . σi+1σ2

i σ−1

i+1 . . . σ−1

Pn = Un ⋋ (Un−1 ⋋ (. . . ⋋ (U3 ⋋ U2)) . . .),

where Ui = ha1i, a2i, . . . , ai−1,ii ≃ Fi−1 is the free group of the rank n − 1, i = 2, 3, . . . , n (see
[5, Section 1.4], [17]).

The virtual braid group and the welded braid group. The virtual braid group V Bn is
presented in the paper [11], where a system of its generators and deﬁning relations is written. In

2

the paper [23] the more compact system of deﬁning relations is constructed (see relations below).
The virtual braid group V Bn is generated by the classical braid group Bn = hσ1, . . . , σn−1i and
the permutation group Sn = hρ1, . . . , ρn−1i. Generators σi, i = 1, . . . , n − 1 satisfy the relations
(1), (2) and generators ρi, i = 1, . . . , n − 1, satisfy the following relations (relations in the
permutation group Sn):

ρ2
i = 1

ρiρj = ρjρi

ρiρi+1ρi = ρi+1ρiρi+1

for i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1,
for |i − j| ≥ 2,
for i = 1, 2 . . . , n − 2.

Other deﬁning relations of the group V Bn are mixed and they are as follows

σiρj = ρjσi

ρiρi+1σi = σi+1ρiρi+1

for |i − j| ≥ 2,
for i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 2.

Note that the last relation is equivalent to:

ρi+1ρiσi+1 = σiρi+1ρi

for i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 2.

(3)
(4)
(5)

(6)
(7)

(8)

As it was pointed out in the paper [11], in the group V Bn the following relations do not hold

ρiσi+1σi = σi+1σiρi+1,

F1 :
F2 : ρi+1σiσi+1 = σiσi+1ρi,

for i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 2,
for i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 2,

which look like relations (8). These relations are referred to as forbidden relations.

In the work [9] the welded braid group denoted by W Bn is presented. This group is generated
by elements σi and αi, i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1. The group generated by elements σi is the classical
braid group Bn, the group generated by elements αi is the permutation group Sn also the mixed
relations hold

αiσj = σjαi

αiαi+1σi = σi+1αiαi+1
σiσi+1αi = αi+1σiσi+1

for |i − j| ≥ 2,
for i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 2,
for i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 2.

(9)
(10)
(11)

Comparing the relations of groups V Bn and W Bn it is clear that W Bn is obtained from V Bn
by adding the additional relation (11) which coincide with F2. Therefore, there exists the
homomorphism

ϕV W : V Bn → W Bn,

putting σi into σi and ρi into αi for all i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1. Hence W Bn is the homomorphic
image of the group V Bn.

3

Note that W Bn is isomorphic to the group of conjugating automorphisms Cn, which is a

subgroup of Aut(Fn) and is studied in [1, 2, 19, 20].

§ 2. Representations of virtual braids by automorphisms

The present section we begin by listing some known representations of the virtual braid
group V Bn by automorphisms of the free group. Next we deﬁne the representation that gener-
alizes all previous ones and in the conclusion we show that all previously written representations
are not faithful for n ≥ 4.

The extension of the Artin representation. The representation V Bn −→ Aut(Fn+1)
(see [3], [16]) into the automorphism group of the free group Fn+1 = hx1, x2, . . . , xn, yi of the
rank n + 1:

ϕA(σi) :(cid:26) xi 7−→ xixi+1x−1

xi+1 7−→ xi,

i

,

ϕA(ρi) :(cid:26) xi 7−→ xy−1

i+1,
xi+1 7−→ xy
i ,

(here and hereafter we write only non-trivial actions on the generators, assume that all other
generators are ﬁxed) is an extension of the Artin representation ϕA : Bn −→ Aut(Fn) (see [5]).
Hence we will hereafter denote it with the same symbol ϕA.

The Silver-Williams representation. For the pair of natural numbers n and k we deﬁne
the group Fn,k+1 = Fn ∗ Zk+1 as the free product of the free group of the rank n and the free
abelian group of the rank k+1. We assume that Fn is freely generated by elements x1, x2, . . . , xn
and Zk+1 is freely generated by elements v, u1, u2, . . . , uk. Note that Fn,1 = Fn+1.

Using the deﬁnition of the generalized Alexander group for virtual links given by D. Silver
and S. Williams [21], we construct the representation ϕSW : V Bn −→ Aut(Fn,n+1) of the virtual
braid group V Bn into the automorphism group of the group Fn,n+1 deﬁned by the action on
the generators

ϕSW (σi) :(cid:26) ui 7−→ ui+1,

ui+1 7−→ ui,

ϕSW (ρi) :(cid:26) ui 7−→ ui+1,

ui+1 7−→ ui,

It is easy to verify that the following automorphism corresponds to the element σ−1

i

We shall prove that this representation generalizes the representation ϕA : V Bn −→
Aut(Fn+1). More precisely the following proposition is true (The idea of this proposition was
suggested by D. Silver).

Proposition 1. If we put

u1 = u2 = . . . = un = y, v = y−1,

and instead of generators x1, x2, . . . , xn we put new generators

z1 = x1, z2 = xy

2, z3 = xy2

3 , . . . , zn = xyn−1

,

n

then the obtained group is isomorphic to Fn+1 and the representation ϕSW is coincide with the
representation ϕA on this group.

Proof. The Silver-Williams representation acts on generators z1, z2, . . . , zn by the rule

ϕSW (σi) :(cid:26) zi 7−→ zizi+1z−1

zi+1 7−→ zi,

i

ϕSW (ρi) :(cid:26) zi 7−→ zy−1

zi+1 7−→ zy
i ,

but it is the representation ϕA.

The Boden - Dies - Gaudreau - Gerlings - Harper - Nicas representation [6]. For
brevity sake we denote this representation by the symbol ϕBD. Let Fn,2 = Fn ∗ Z2, where Fn
is freely generated by elements x1, x2, . . . , xn and Z2 is freely generated by elements v, u. The
representation ϕBD : V Bn −→ Aut(Fn,2) of the virtual braid group V Bn into the automorphism
group of the group Fn,2 is deﬁned by the action on the generators:

ϕBD(σi) :(cid:26) xi 7−→ xixi+1x−u

xi+1 7−→ xu
i ,

ϕBD(ρi) :(cid:26) xi 7−→ xv−1

A new representation of the virtual braid group. Now we deﬁne a new representa-
tion of V Bn which generalizes the representations listed above. We consider the free product
Fn,2n+1 = Fn ∗ Z2n+1, where Fn is a free group of the rank n generated by elements x1, x2, . . . , xn
and Z2n+1 is a free abelian group of the rank 2n + 1 freely generated by elements u1, u2, . . . , un,
v0, v1, v2, . . . , vn. The following statement is true

Theorem 1. The following mapping ϕM : V Bn −→ Aut(Fn,2n+1) deﬁned by the action on

the generators:

is provided a representation of V Bn into Aut(Fn,2n+1).

ϕM (ρi) :(cid:26) vi 7−→ vi+1,

vi+1 7−→ vi,

Proof. It is need to verify that the relations of the group V Bn go to the relations of V Bn.
It is easy to check that it is so for the commutativity relations since the representation ϕM is
the local representation.

Let us verify the correctness of the relation

ϕM (σi)ϕM (σi+1)ϕM (σi) = ϕM (σi+1)ϕM (σi)ϕM (σi+1).

For that purpose we ﬁnd the action of ϕM (σi)ϕM (σi+1)ϕM (σi) on the generators x1, . . ., xn.
We have

Comparing the obtained automorphisms it can be seen that the long relation of the braid group
holds when it acts on the generators of Fn. The fact that the relation holds with the action
on subgroups generated by elements uj and vj follows from the fact that the automorphisms
ϕM (σi) act as permutations.

We verify the correctness of the mixed relation

ϕM (ρi)ϕM (ρi+1)ϕM (σi) = ϕM (σi+1)ϕM (ρi)ϕM (ρi+1).

For that purpose we ﬁnd the action of ϕM (ρi)ϕM (ρi+1)ϕM (σi) on the generators x1, . . ., xn.
We have

Analogously we ﬁnd the action of ϕM (σi+1)ϕM (ρi)ϕM (ρi+1). We obtain

ϕM (ρi)ϕM (ρi+1)ϕM (σi) :

Comparing the obtained automorphisms it is clear that the mixed relation of the braid group
holds on the generators of Fn. The fact that the relation holds with the action on subgroups
generated by elements uj and vj follows because the automorphisms ϕM (σi) and ϕM (ρi) act as
permutations.

The remaining relations are veriﬁed analogously. The theorem is proved.

It is easy to check that the element ϕM (σ−1

We show that this representation generalizes the representations ϕSW and ϕBD. It is true

Proposition 2. 1) If we put

in the group Fn,2n+1 and insert new generators z1, . . . zn such that

v1 = v2 = . . . = vn = v

z1 = x1, z2 = xv

2, z3 = xv2

3 , . . . , zn = xvn−1

n

, wi = vui,

i = 1, 2, . . . , n,

then we obtain the group Fn,n+1 on which the representation ϕM induces the representation
ϕSW .

2) If we put

u1 = u2 = . . . = un = 1, v0 = u, v1 = v2 = . . . = vn = v

in the group Fn,2n+1, then we obtain the group Fn,2 on which the representation ϕM induces the
representation ϕBD.

Proof. 1) Note that on the new generators z1, . . . , zn the automorphisms ϕM (σi) and ϕM (ρi)

act by the rule

Assuming wi = vui for i = 1, 2, . . . , n, we obtain the Silver-Williams representation.

The second part of the proposition is veriﬁed analogously. The proposition is proved.

The representation of the virtual pure braid group. The virtual pure braid group

V Pn is the kernel of the homomorphism V Bn −→ Sn which acts on the generators:

σi 7−→ ρi, ρi 7−→ ρi,

i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1.

It was found out in [1] that the group V Pn is generated by elements

λi,i+1 = ρi σ−1

1 ≤ i < j − 1 ≤ n − 1.

We ﬁnd the images of the generators λij, λji under the representation ϕM . It is true

The representation of the welded braid group. We consider Fn,n+1 which equals to
the free product Fn ∗ Zn+1, where Zn+1 is a free abelian group of the rank n + 1 freely generated
by elements v, u1, u2, . . . , un. The following statement is true

determines the representation of the group W Bn into the group Aut(Fn,n+1).

It could be seen that the representation of the group W Bn is obtained from the one of the

group V Bn providing all generators vi are sent to 1, where 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

Proof. It is suﬃcient to check that the relation F1 holds

ψM (ρi)ψM (σi+1)ψM (σi) = ψM (σi+1)ψM (σi)ψM (ρi+1)

which is the forbidden relation in V Bn. We ﬁnd the action of the automorphism ψM (ρi)ψM (σi+1)ψM (σi)
on the generators of Fn. We obtain

ψM (ρi)ψM (σi+1)ψM (σi) :

Comparing the obtained automorphisms we see that the required relation holds.

The proposition is proved.

As it is known the relation F1 holds in W Bn but at the same time the relation F2 does not
hold. It would be interesting to construct representations of other factor-groups of the group
V Bn. For example, the representation of the group UV Bn in which both forbidden relations
hold. We verify the conditions for the second forbidden relation F2 to hold:

ψM (ρi+1)ψM (σi)ψM (σi+1) = ψM (σi)ψM (σi+1)ψM (ρi).

We ﬁnd the action of the automorphism ψM (ρi+1)ψM (σi)ψM (σi+1) on the generators of Fn. We
obtain

Analogously we ﬁnd the action of the automorphism ψM (σi)ψM (σi+1)ψM (ρi). We have

Comparing the obtained automorphisms it can be seen that the required relation holds providing
the following restriction

§ 3. Representation that is equivalent to the representation ϕM

The constructed representation ϕM is not an extension of the Artin representation which is
known to be faithful on the subgroup Bn. We show that the representation ϕM is equivalent
to the simpler one which is an extension of the Artin representation. Let Fn,n = Fn ∗ Zn where
Fn = hy1, y2, . . . , yni is the free group and Zn = hv1, v2, . . . , vni is the free abelian group of the
rank n. It is true

The lemma is proved.

phisms ui ⇆ wi where i = 1, . . . , n.

Hence the most general representation eϕM is in fact the extension of the Artin representation

Using the result of O. Chterental [8] who proved that the representation ϕA of the group
V Bn is not faithful for n ≥ 4, it could be shown that the representations ϕSW and ϕBD are not
faithful for n ≥ 4 as well. It is true

§ 4. The link groups

To ﬁnd a presentation of the link group two approaches could be used. The ﬁrst one is
the Wirtinger approach when the link diagram on the plane is used to ﬁnd the generators and
deﬁning relations of the link group. The second one is to consider the link as a closed braid and
use the braid group representation into the automorphism group of some group. Both these
approaches are described in the book [5] for classical links and in the paper [4] for virtual ones.
In particular, for each virtual braid β the groups GA(β), GSW (β), GBD(β) and GM (β) could be
deﬁned using the representations ϕA, ϕSW , ϕBD and ϕM correspondingly. In addition it should

be proved that the corresponding group depends only on the link bβ (the link bβ is the closure

The classical link group. Recall that for a classical link L in S3 its group G(L) is the
fundamental group π1(S3 \ L) of the complement of L in S3. To ﬁnd generators and relations
of the group G(L) either the link diagram or the consideration of the link as the closed braid
and the Artin representation could be used. In the case we use the link diagram the generator
is assigned to each connected component and the following relation is assigned to each classical
crossing: ab = bc or its equivalent c = b−1ab for the positive crossing (see Fig. 1 on the left)
and ab = ca or its equivalent c = aba−1 for the negative crossing (see Fig. 1 on the right).

the free abelian group Πd = hu1, u2, . . . , ud, vi of the rank d + 1 was used. In particular provided
L a knot, the free abelian group Π1 = hu, vi of the rank 2 is used.

The particular generator is assigned to each arc of the diagram L from one classical crossing
to another one. Two relations are assigned to each positive crossing: abui = cduj , b = cv (see
Fig. 2 on the left) which could be written in the form

Two relations are assigned to each negative crossing: abui = cduj , d = av (see Fig. 2 on the

No relation is assigned to the virtual crossing.

The welded braid group. For the welded d component link L the generalized Alexander
group AL is constructed (see [21]) which is obtained from the corresponding virtual link by
putting v = 1, i. e. the following relations correspond to each classical crossing

abui = cduj , b = c

for the positive case and the relations

abui = cduj , d = a

for the negative one.

The generalized Alexander group of the trivial d component link Ud is a free product Fd ∗ Zd

of the free group of the rank d and the free abelian group of the same rank.

§ 5. The virtual link groups

In the present section the new deﬁnition of the virtual link group is given. For this two
approaches are used: the group will be deﬁned at ﬁrst with the help of the representation ϕM
(the braid approach) then through the virtual diagram. Next the equivalence of these two
deﬁnitions is shown.

The braid approach. We describe the general way which allows to construct the link
invariants through the representation of the virtual braid group by automorphisms of some
group. Assume that we have a representation ϕ : V Bn −→ Aut(H) of the virtual braid group
into the automorphism group of some group H = hh1, h2, . . . , hm k Ri, where R is the set of
deﬁning relations. The following group is assigned to the virtual braid β ∈ V Bn:

Gϕ(β) = hh1, h2, . . . , hm k R, hi = ϕ(β)(hi),

i = 1, 2, . . . , mi.

The group Gϕ is the invariant of the virtual link providing the veriﬁcation that the group Gϕ(β)

is isomorphic to Gϕ(β ′) for each braid β ′ such that the links bβ and bβ ′ are equivalent.

This approach is used for the previously deﬁned representation ϕM . Given β ∈ V Bn, the

group of the braid β is the following group

GM (β) = hx1, x2, . . . , xn, u1, u2, . . . , un, v0, v1, . . . , vn || [ui, uj] = [vk, vl] = [ui, vk] = 1,
i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n, k, l = 0, 1, . . . , ni.

xi = ϕM (β)(xi), ui = ϕM (β)(ui), vi = ϕM (β)(vi),

Let show that the group deﬁned in this manner is indeed the link invariant. More precisely

it is true

Theorem 3. Given β ∈ V Bn and β ′ ∈ V Bm the two virtual braids such that theirs closures
deﬁne the same link L, then GM (β) ∼= GM (β ′), i. e. the group GM (β) is the link L invariant

and it could be denoted by the symbol GM (bβ) = GM (L).

The next paragraph is dedicated to the proof of the theorem.

The diagram approach. Now we show the way of how to ﬁnd the virtual link group using
its diagram. Let DL be a diagram of a virtual d-component link L. This diagram is divided
into arcs from one crossing (classical or virtual) to other and for every obtained arc a generator
is assigned. Thus we have some set of generators a, b, c, . . .. We numerate all components of
DL by numbers from 1 to d and assign to the i th component two generators: ui and vi.

A group of the diagram DL is the group generated by elements a, b, c, . . ., ui, v0, vi, i =
1, . . . , d, and deﬁned by the following system of relations: two relations correspond to each
crossing(see Fig. 3, 4).
e.
hu1, . . . , ud, v0, v1, . . . , vdi is a free abelian group of the rank 2d + 1.

Furthermore, all elements ui and vj commute pairwise , i.

This group is denoted by GD(DL). If D′

L is another diagram of L, then DL can be trans-
L with the help of a ﬁnite number of generalized Reidemeister moves and a ﬂat

formed to D′
isotopy. Analogously to the case of classical link diagrams it is not diﬃcult to prove

Proposition 6. If DL and D′

L are two diagrams of a virtual link L, then groups GD(DL) and

GD(D′

L) are isomorphic. Hence GD(DL) is an invariant of L and we denote it by GD(L).

Now we show that the group of a virtual link L constructed by the braid is isomorphic to

the group constructed by the diagram. More precisely, it is true

Proposition 7. Let L be a virtual link, DL be its diagram, β be a braid such that its closure

bβ is equivalent to L, then GD(DL) is isomorphic to GM (β).

Proof. Let β be a virtual braid from the group V Bn for some n. We consider the braid β
as a word in the alphabet {σ±1
and ρi
has a geometric interpretation and can be presented by its diagram. Hence the braid β can
be presented by a diagram which is divided in the layers so that each layer contains only one
crossing: classical or virtual. The generators σi or σ−1
correspond to the classical crossing and
the generator ρi corresponds to the virtual one. If the braid β is a word of the length m in the

group V Bn, then its diagram contains m layers. We consider the ﬁrst layer. It contains n arcs.
The middle line of the ﬁrst layer divides these arcs in half. We assign to starting parts of these
arcs the symbols x1,j, u1,j, v1,j, j = 1, 2, . . . , n. To the next parts of the arcs which end at the
middle of the second layer we assign the symbols x2,j, u2,j, v2,j, j = 1, 2, . . . , n. By continuing
this process we divide the diagram β into n(m + 1) arcs.

We are moving alongside the braid diagram from the bottom upwards, i.e. we are reading
the word β from right to left. Let the k-th layer contain the classical crossing, which corresponds
to the elementary braid σi. In this layer we have two sets of arcs with the corresponding sets
of symbols xkj, ukj, vkj and xk+1,j, uk+1,j, vk+1,j, j = 1, . . . , n.

Using these relations, we move alongside the braid β from the bottom upwards and we

um,j, vm,j, j = 1, 2, . . . , n. Next we consider the m − 1-th layer and expressing the generators
xm+1,j, um+1,j, vm+1,j through the generators xm−1,j, um−1,j, vm−1,j, j = 1, 2, . . . , n, and so on.

It follows from relations 1), 2), 4) that the generators uk,l, vk,l that correspond to one
component of the link are equal. This corresponds to the fact that under the homomorphism
of V Bn onto Sn the image β in Sn is a product of d independent cycles. Hence among the
generators ui,l (also as among the generators vi,l) there are only d diﬀerent ones.

Excluding transitional letters xk,l, uk,l, vk,l, k ≥ 2, we obtain relations

ϕM (β)(x1) = x1, . . . , ϕM (β)(xn) = xn,

ϕM (β)(u1) = u1, . . . , ϕM (β)(un) = un,

. . ., u1,n = un, v1,1 = v1, . . ., v1,n = vn. Hence we get the representation of the group GM (β).
The proposition is proved.

Welded link group. A welded ling group could be deﬁned analogously using the repre-
sentation ψM . Let a welded link Lw be equivalent to a closure of the braid βw ∈ W Bn for some
n. The group of the braid βw is the following group

G(βw) = hx1, x2, . . . , xn, u1, u2, . . . , un || [ui, uj] = 1,

xi = ψM (βw)(xi), ui = ψM (βw)(ui),

i, j = 1, 2, . . . , ni.

Taking into account the fact that the group W Bn is a homomorphic image of the group V Bn,
it could be concluded from Theorem 3 that the group G(βw) is an invariant of the link Lw.

§ 6. Proof of Theorem 3

The proof of this theorem is divided into several steps. At ﬁrst it will be shown that the

Theorem 4. Let β ∈ V Bn and β ′ ∈ V Bm be two virtual braids such that theirs closures
deﬁne the same link L, then G fM (β) ∼= G fM (β ′), i. e. the group G fM (β) is the invariant of the

group G fM (β) which is constructed using the representation fϕM is the invariant of closed braid
bβ. It is true
link L = bβ and it will be denoted by the symbol G fM (L).

Proof. Kamada proved the analogue of Markov’s theorem in the case of virtual braids
[10]. This theorem formulated in the algebraic terms by Kauﬀman and Lambropoulou [12] is
more convenient for the veriﬁcation. According to this theorem two oriented virtual links are
equivalent if and only if two corresponding virtual braids diﬀer by braid relations in V Bn and
a ﬁnite sequence of the following moves or their inverses:

1) Virtual and real conjugation:

β → ρkβρk,

β → σkβσ−1

2) Right virtual and real stabilization:

where β, ρk, σk ∈ V Bn, k = 1, . . . , n − 1 and ρn, σn ∈ V Bn+1.

It is needed to verify that groups obtained by moves 1) – 4) are isomorphic to the group

G fM (β).

right of the arguments. We denote by symbol G1 the group constructed using the braid β:

To simplify notations we will write β instead of eϕM (β) and write automorphisms to the

G1 = G fM (β) = hy1, y2, . . . , yn, v1, v2, . . . , vn k yi = yiβ, vi = viβ, i = 1, 2, . . . , ni.

From now on we will not write commutativity relations of the elements vi.

1) We consider the conjugacy of the braid β in the group V Bn. Conjugating by the generator
the following group is obtained

σ−1
k

k ) = hy1, . . . , yn, v1, . . . , vn k yi = yi(σkβσ−1

G2 = G fM (σkβσ−1
k ), i = 1, 2, . . . , ni,
where k ∈ 1, 2, . . . , n − 1. To prove that G2 ∼= G1 deﬁning relations of G2 are rewritten in the
form

k ), vi = vi(σkβσ−1

If i 6= k, k + 1, due to the equality yiσk = yi, this relation is equivalent consequently

yiσk = yi(σkβ), i = 1, 2, . . . , n.

which is the relation in G1. Thus only four relations are needed to consider:

yi = yiβ

ykσk = yk(σkβ),
vkσk = vk(σkβ),

yk+1σk = yk+1(σkβ),
vk+1σk = vk+1(σkβ).

(12)

By deﬁnition of eϕM relations (12) are equivalent to

k = (ykyk+1y−1

ykyk+1y−1

k )β,

vk+1 = vk+1β,

yk = ykβ,
vk = vkβ.

It is clear that the second, the third and the fourth relations are relations in G1. We rewrite
the ﬁrst relation:

ykyk+1y−1

k = (ykβ)(yk+1β)(y−1

k β)

Using the second relation we obtain

yk+1 = yk+1β,

i. e. it is a relation in G1. Hence it has been proved that it is possible to go from the group G2
to the group G1 using the Tietze transformations.

19

We are considering the conjugation by the element ρk. In that case we have

G2 = G fM (ρkβρk) = hy1, . . . , yn, v1, . . . , vn k yi = yi(ρkβρk), vi = vi(ρkβρk), i = 1, 2, . . . , ni.

We rewrite deﬁning relations of G2 in the form

yiρk = yi(ρkβ), i = 1, 2, . . . , n.

If i 6= k, k + 1, then we obtain

yi = yiβ,

due to yiρk = yi. But it is the relation in G1. Hence only four relations have to be considered:

ykρk = yk(ρkβ),
vkρk = vk(ρkβ),

yk+1ρk = yk+1(ρkβ),
vk+1ρk = vk+1(ρkβ).

These relations are equivalent to the following ones

yv−1
k+1 = yv−1
k+1β,
vk+1 = vk+1β,

k = yvk+1

It is easy to see that the relation of G1 is obtained. Thus the fact has been proved that the set
of relations in G2 is equivalent to the set of relations in G1.

2) We are considering the move of the braid β ∈ V Bn into the braid βσ−1

n ∈ V Bn+1. We

are dealing with two groups G1 and

G2 = G fM (βσ−1

n ) = hy1, . . . , yn, yn+1, v1, . . . , vn, vn+1 k yi = yi(βσ−1

n ), vi = vi(βσ−1

n ), i = 1, 2, . . . , n+1i

and it is needed to prove that they are isomorphic.

We rewrite relations of G2 in the form

Using the same reasoning as in 1) we have to consider only four relations:

yiσn = yiβ, i = 1, 2, . . . , n + 1.

ynσn = ynβ,
vnσn = vnβ,

yn+1σn = yn+1β
vn+1σn = vn+1β.

(13)

By deﬁnition ϕ fM relations (13) are equivalent to

ynyn+1y−1

n = ynβ,
vn+1 = vnβ,

yn = yn+1,
vn = vn+1.

Using the second relation the ﬁrst one is rewritten in the form

yn = ynβ

20

which is the relation in G1. Using relations yn+1 = yn and vn+1 = vn we can exclude yn+1 and
vn+1 from the generator set of the group G2. Thus it has been proved that the group G2 is
isomorphic to the group G1.

The move of the braid β ∈ V Bn into the braid βσn ∈ V Bn+1 are considered analogously.
Now we consider the move of the braid β ∈ V Bn into the braid βρn ∈ V Bn+1. Two groups

are obtained, G1 and

G2 = G cM (βρn) = hy1, . . . , yn, yn+1, v1, . . . , vn, vn+1 k yi = yi(βρn), vi = vi(βρn), i = 1, 2, . . . , n+1i.

For i = n and i = n + 1 we have the following relations in G2:

ynρn = ynβ,
vnρn = vnβ,

yn+1ρn = yn+1β
vn+1ρn = vn+1β

which are equivalent to relations

n

yv−1
n+1 = ynβ,
vn+1 = vnβ,

yvn+1
n = yn+1β = yn+1,
vn = vn+1.

Substituting yn+1 from the second equation into the ﬁrst relation, we obtain

yn = ynβ

and that is the relation in G1. Using the second and the fourth relations variables yn+1 and
vn+1 could be excluded from the set of generators of the group G2. Hence we have proved that
the group G2 is isomorphic to the group G1.

3) We are considering the algebraic right over threading, i. e. the move of the braid β ∈ V Bn

into the braid βσnρn−1σ−1

n ∈ V Bn+1. In this case we have G1 and

G2 = G fM (βσnρn−1σ−1

n ) =hy1, y2, . . . , yn, yn+1, v1, . . . , vn, vn+1 k

yi = yi(βσnρn−1σ−1

n ), vi = vi(βσnρn−1σ−1

n ),

i = 1, 2, . . . , n + 1i.

To prove that G1 ∼= G2 we rewrite relations of G2 in the form

yiσnρn−1σ−1

n = yiβ, viσnρn−1σ−1

n = viβ, i = 1, 2, . . . , n + 1.

If i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 2 then we have

yi = yiβ, vi = viβ.

These are relations in G1. Hence we have to consider only six relations:

yn−1(σnρn−1σ−1
vn−1(σnρn−1σ−1

n ) = yn−1β, yn(σnρn−1σ−1
n ) = vn−1β, vn(σnρn−1σ−1

n ) = ynβ, yn+1(σnρn−1σ−1
n ) = vnβ, vn+1(σnρn−1σ−1

n ) = yn+1β,
n ) = vn+1β.

The braid β acts on generators yn+1 and vn+1 trivially since β ∈ V Bn,
yn+1, vn+1β = vn+1. Consequently, the third and the sixth relations are equivalent to

e.

i.

yn+1β =

n−1 = yn+1, vn−1 = vn+1,

correspondingly. Substituting the third relation into the ﬁrst one and taking into account the
sixth relation, we obtain

yn−1 = yn−1β,

which is the relation in G1. Using the third relation we obtain that the second relation is
equivalent to

yn = ynβ,

which is the relation in G1. Besides yn+1 and vn+1 could be excluded from the generator set
of G2. Therefore, it has been proved that the set of relations of G2 is equivalent to the set of
relations of G1.

4) We are considering the algebraic left over threading, i. e. the move of the braid β ∈ V Bn

into the braid βρnρn−1σ−1

n−1ρnσn−1ρn−1ρn ∈ V Bn+1. In this case

G2 = G(βσnρn−1σ−1

yi = yi(βρnρn−1σ−1

n−1ρnσn−1ρn−1ρn), i = 1, 2, . . . , n + 1i.

To prove that G1 ∼= G2 we rewrite relations of G2 in the form

yiρnρn−1σ−1

n−1ρnσn−1ρn−1ρn = yiβ, i = 1, 2, . . . , n + 1.

22

If i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 2 we have

yi = yiβ

which is the relation in G1. Hence it has to be considered only six relations:

yn−1(ρnρn−1σ−1
yn(ρnρn−1σ−1
yn+1(ρnρn−1σ−1
vn−1(ρnρn−1σ−1
vn(ρnρn−1σ−1
vn+1(ρnρn−1σ−1

n−1ρnσn−1ρn−1ρn) = yn−1β,
n−1ρnσn−1ρn−1ρn) = ynβ,
n−1ρnσn−1ρn−1ρn) = yn+1β,
n−1ρnσn−1ρn−1ρn) = vn−1β,
n−1ρnσn−1ρn−1ρn) = vnβ,
n−1ρnσn−1ρn−1ρn) = vn+1β.

(15)

Denote the braid ρnρn−1σ−1

n−1ρnσn−1ρn−1ρn by b. It is easy to see that b acts on generators

yn−1, yn, yn+1, vn−1, vn, vn+1 in the following way:

equivalent to

yvn+1vn−1
n

vn = vn+1.

Obtained equations are substituted in the ﬁrst and the second relations and it results in

yn−1 = yn−1β, yn = ynβ,

which are the relations in G1. The generator yn+1 and vn+1 could be excluded from the gener-
ating set of G2. Therefore, the fact has been proved that the set of relations of G2 is equivalent
to the set of relations of G1.

The theorem is proved.

that the group GM (β) is isomorphic to the group G cM (β). According to the proved theorem,

We proved that the representation ϕM is equivalent to the representation eϕM . Now we show
the group GM (β) is an invariant of the link bβ and this fact leads to the proof of Theorem 3.
{y1, . . . , ym} is chosen, then the group G has the presentation G = hY k eRi which connected

with the initial presentation by the sequence of Tietze transformations. From now on we assume
the generating sets X, Y and their corresponding sets of deﬁning relations are ﬁxed.

Let a group G have the presentation G = hX k Ri, where X = {x1, . . . , xn} is the generating
If in the group G another generating set Y =

set and R is the set of deﬁning relations.

If ϕ is some automorphism of the group G, then a group could be deﬁned using the generating

set X

G(X, ϕ) = hX k R, ϕ(xi) = xi, i = 1, . . . , ni.

Analogously using the generating set Y and the automorphism ϕ, a group could be deﬁned

It is true

G(Y, ϕ) = hY k eR, ϕ(yj) = yj, j = 1, . . . , mi.

Theorem 5. Groups G(X, ϕ) and G(Y, ϕ) are isomorphic.
Proof. Let the automorphism ϕ act on generating sets X and Y in the following way

ϕ(xi) = wi(X), ϕ(yj) = uj(Y ),

where wi(X) and uj(Y ) are words in the terms of generators X and Y as well as their inverses
consequently for i = 1, . . . , n, j = 1, . . . , m. We ﬁx expressions

xi = bi(Y ),

yj = aj(X)

to express generators of X through Y and, visa versa, generators Y through X. To simplify
the notation indices i and j are dropped out so there are obtained systems of equations

ϕ(X) = W (X), ϕ(Y ) = U(Y ), X = B(Y ),

Y = A(X).

Since the automorphism ϕ of the group G that acts on generators of X and Y is the same, the
following systems of equations

A(W (B(Y ))) = U(Y ) ⇔ A(W (X)) = U(A(X)) ⇔ W (B(Y )) = B(U(Y ))

are equivalent in the group G.

The proof of the theorem statement is to apply sequentially the Tietze transformations to
the presentation of the group G(X, ϕ). Thus we consider the group G(X, ϕ). By deﬁnition we
have

G(X, ϕ) = hX k R, X = W (X)i.

24

We add elements Y into the generating set and the equations Y = A(X) into the set of relations

G(X, ϕ) = hX, Y k R, X = W (X), Y = A(X)i.

Relations Y = A(X) are equivalent to X = B(Y ) with the module of relations R. Thus

hX, Y k R, X = W (X), Y = A(X)i ≃ hX, Y k R, X = W (X), X = B(Y )i.

Excluding generators X and relations X = B(Y ) we obtain

hX, Y k R, X = W (X), X = B(Y )i ≃ hY k eR, B(Y ) = W (B(Y ))i.

Since W (B(Y )) = B(U(Y )) we have

Taking into account that in the group G the equations A(B(Y )) = Y and B(A(X)) = X hold,
it could be seen that systems of relations B(Y ) = B(Z) and Y = Z are equivalent in the group

hY k eR, B(Y ) = W (B(Y ))i ≃ hY k eR, B(Y ) = B(U(Y ))i.
G (i. e. they are equivalent with the module of relations eR). Consequently
hY k eR, B(Y ) = B(U(Y ))i ≃ hY k eR, Y = U(Y )i = G(Y, ϕ).

Therefore,

G(X, ϕ) ≃ G(Y, ϕ).

The theorem is proved.

As a corollary the fact is obtained that groups GM (L) and G fM (L) are isomorphic. Conse-

quently Theorem 3 is proved.

§ 7. Properties of link groups

Directly from the deﬁnition of the group GM it could be derived
Proposition 6. If L is d-component link which is presented by a closure of a n-strand braid,
then in the group GM (L) there are d diﬀerent generators among u1, u2, . . . , un. In particular,
provided L a knot, u1 = u2 = . . . = un.

corollary one can prove

As shown earlier the representation eϕM is an extension of the Artin representation. As a

Proposition 7. Given a classical d-component link L, there is the following isomorphism

of groups

G fM (L) = G(L) ∗ Zd, where G(L) = π1(S3 \ L).

and in the second crossing the relations

Excluding generators x3 and x4, we obtain the presentation

If a generator x2 replaced by a new one b which equals to x2u−1, then the presentation is of the

On the other hand, the virtual trefoil could be presented as a classical knot in the thickened
torus. The fundamental group of the knot complement in the thickened torus was found in [7]
and it has the following presentation

26

question is given by

A natural question arises about the isomorphism of groups eATv and G. The answer on this
Proposition 8. Groups eATv and G are not isomorphic.
Proof. For brevity we denote H = eATv . We show that the factor-groups H/γ3H and G/γ3G

of these groups by the third term of lower central series are not isomorphic to each other. We
obtain

bbv−1
bv−1

bv = b2[b, v−1]b[b, v] ≡ b3 (mod γ3H),

bvb = b[b, v−1]b[b, v]b ≡ b3 (mod γ3H).

Hence

H/γ3H = hb, u, v || [u, v] = 1, γ3H = 1i.

In particular, γ2H/γ3H ∼= Z × Z (it is generated by images of the commutators [b, u], [b, v]).

On the other hand

axayaxy = a[a, x]a[a, y]a[a, xy] ≡ a3[a, xy]2 (mod γ3G),

aaxay = a2[a, x]a[a, y] ≡ a3[a, xy] (mod γ3G).

Therefore,

G/γ3G = ha, x, y || [x, y] = 1,

[a, xy] = 1, γ3G = 1i.

In particular, γ2G/γ3G ∼= Z (it is generated by images of the commutator [a, x]).

As factor-groups γ2H/γ3H and γ2G/γ3G are not isomorphic so the correspondent groups

H and G are not isomorphic. The proposition is proved.

We show that the group eATv is a HNN-extension of the one-relator group.

Proposition 9. The group

bbv−1

bv = bv−1

bvbi

is a HNN-extension.

Proof. Using Tietze transformations for the presentation of eATv, we obtain

bv = bv−1

bvbi =

eATv = hb, u, v || [u, v] = 1,
eATv = hb, u, v || [u, v] = 1, bbv−1

= hb, u, v || uv = u,

[bv−1

bv, b] = 1i =

= hb, u, v, z, t || uv = u, z = bv−1

,

t = bv,

[zt, b] = 1i =

= hb, u, v, z, t || uv = u, zv = b, bv = t,

[zt, b] = 1i.

We consider the group

and its subgroups

G = hb, u, z, t || [zt, b] = 1i

A = hb, u, zi, B = hb, u, ti.

27

It is suﬃcient to show that the mapping

u 7→ u,

z 7→ b,

b 7→ t

is an isomorphism of the subgroup A onto the subgroup B. For that purpose it is suﬃcient
to show that A and B are free subgroups of the rank 3 with free generators u, b, z and u, b, t
respectively. Taking into account that

G = hb, u, z, t || [zt, b] = 1i = hui ∗ eG,

where

it is suﬃcient to show that subgroups

eG = hb, z, t || [zt, b] = 1i,
eB = hb, ti
eA = hb, zi,
are free groups of the rank 2 in the group eG. We consider the homomorphic image of the group
eG which is obtained by adding relations t = z−1:

hb, z, t || [zt, b] = 1,

t = z−1i.

Excluding the generator t, the free group hb, zi is obtained which is covered by the image of the

subgroup eA. And excluding the generator z, the free group ht, zi is obtained which is covered
by the image of the subgroup eB. Therefore, eA and eB are free subgroups of the rank 2 with

free generators b, z and b, t respectively. It leads to the fact that A and B are free subgroups
of the rank 3 with free generators u, b, z and u, b, t respectively.

Hence

is a HNN-extension of the group

eATv = hb, u, v, z, t || uv = u, zv = b, bv = t,

[zt, b] = 1i

with the stable letter v and associated subgroups

G = hb, u, z, t || [zt, b] = 1i

A = hb, u, zi, B = hb, u, ti.

The proposition is proved.
