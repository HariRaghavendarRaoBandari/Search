On Spinor Transformations

Abstract

We begin observing that, if a vector space V is even dimensional,
all automorphisms of its Cliﬀord algebra are inner. So all orthogonal
transformations of V can be seen as restrictions to V of inner automor-
phisms of the algebra. Thus under orthogonal transformations P and
T - space and time reversal - all algebra elements, including vectors
v and spinors ϕ, transform as v → xvx−1 and ϕ → xϕx−1 for some
algebra element x. We show that while under combined P T spinor
ϕ → xϕx−1 remain in its spinor space, under P or T separately ϕ
goes to a diﬀerent spinor space and may have opposite chirality. We
conclude with a preliminary characterization of inner automorphisms
with respect to their property to change, or not, spinor spaces.

1 Introduction

In 1913 Élie Cartan introduced spinors [5, 6] and, after more than a century,
this mother lode is always valuable. Spinors were later thoroughly investi-
gated by Claude Chevalley [8] in the mathematical frame of Cliﬀord algebra
where they were identiﬁed as elements of Minimal Left Ideals (MLI) of the
algebra. More than 40 years later Ian Porteous wrote a book with many of
these results easier to be assimilated by physicists [13].

In this paper we address the transformation properties of spinors under
certain inner automorphisms of Cliﬀord algebra exploiting the Extended
Fock Basis (EFB) of Cliﬀord algebra [1, 2] recalled in section 2. As a sam-
ple application of this formalism we show how to write vectors as linear
superposition of simple spinors (13), thus supporting the well-known Pen-
rose twistor program [11] that spinor structure is the underlying - more
fundamental - structure of Minkowski spacetime.

In the subsequent section 3 we review some quite general properties of
Cliﬀord algebra and in particular the fact that it contains many diﬀerent
MLI, namely many diﬀerent spinor spaces, that are completely equivalent in

1

the sense that each of them can carry an equivalent representation; moreover
the algebra, as a vector space, can be seen as the direct sum of these spinor
spaces. These properties are well known and recently it has been suggested
that multiple spinor spaces play a role in physics [10].

One of the most important properties of Cliﬀord algebra is that it estab-
lishes a deep connection between the orthogonal transformations of vector
space V with scalar product g (more precisely: its image in the algebra) and
the automorphisms of Cliﬀord algebra Cℓ(g). In section 4 we show that if
the vector space is even dimensional then all Cℓ(g) automorphisms are in-
ner automorphisms and thus that all orthogonal transformations on V lift
to inner automorphisms of Cℓ(g). We then examine in detail the so called
discrete orthogonal transformations of V , namely 1V , P, T and P T (identity,
space and time reversal and their composition) and we focus on the inner
algebra automorphism they induce. This study takes advantage from the
properties of the EFB that allow to remain within the algebra without using
representations. At the same time we exhibit the elements of the algebra
that generate these inner automorphisms.
It follows that we can look at
1V , P, T and P T as to restrictions of full ﬂedged algebra automorphisms to
V , thus unifying the treatment of the discrete transformations of V with
those of the continuous ones of the Pin (g) group.

A similar approach was followed also by Varlamov [14, 15] to study
the hierarchies of Pin (g) and O (g) groups and he succesfully classiﬁed the
automorphisms of Cℓ(g) showing that the eight double coverings of O (g), the
Dabrowski groups [9], correspond to the eight types of real Cliﬀord algebras:
the so called “spinorial clock” [3].

Here we exploit the same uniﬁcation to investigate a diﬀerent subject:

given an inner automorphism

α : Cℓ(g) → Cℓ(g); α(µ) = xµx−1

x ∈ Cℓ(g)

it is natural to assume that all algebra elements must transform accordingly
and in particular that the typical physics equations vϕ = 0, where v ∈ V
and ϕ is a spinor, must go to α(vϕ) = 0. We remark that ϕ is both a
carrier of the regular representation and an element of Cℓ(g) so the equation
α(vϕ) = 0 is justiﬁed. Since the automorphism is inner it follows that also
the spinor ϕ must transform as α(ϕ) = xϕx−1 thus adding an “extra” x−1
to the “traditional rule” stating that vectors transforms as v → xvx−1 while
spinors as ϕ → xϕ.

We examine in detail the eﬀect of the transformation α(ϕ) = xϕx−1
proving that if on one side it can not alter in any way the solutions of
vϕ = 0, on the other hand, in some cases, it “moves” ϕ to a diﬀerent spinor
space, one of the many equivalent ones in Cℓ(g). In particular we show that
while the automorphisms corresponding to 1V and P T do not move spinors,
those corresponding to P and T move them, thus populating other spinor
spaces.

2

In penultimate section 5 we begin the characterization of these auto-
morphisms: those that keep the spinor space constant, like 1V and P T , and
those that do not, like P and T , and we show that the latter transformations
can also invert spinor chiralities. This is just the beginning of the study of
these transformations that will be completed in a companion paper where
also continuous transformations will be examined.

For the convenience of the reader we tried to make this paper as elemen-

tary and self-contained as possible.

2 Cliﬀord algebra and its ’Extended Fock Basis’

We summarize the essential properties of the EFB introduced in 2009 [1, 2];
we consider Cliﬀord algebras Cℓ(g) [8, 13, 3] over the ﬁelds F = R or C and
an even dimensional vector space V equipped with a non degenerate scalar
product g; any base e1, e2, . . . , en with n = 2m generates the algebra that
results: simple, central and of dimension 22m.

EFB formalism is fully developed for the so called neutral spaces, V =
C2m or Rm,m, spaces that can be seen as the direct sum of two totally null
planes of (maximal) dimension m, and so most of the time we stick to these
spaces indicating the corresponding Cliﬀord algebra Cℓ(m, m). At the same
time this choice allows to treat a simpler case, avoiding the many intricacies
brought in by other signatures; the extension of the formalism to arbitrary R
signatures and to odd dimensional spaces is the subject of ongoing research.
In neutral spaces the ei’s form an orthonormal basis of V with

2g(ei, ej) = eiej + ejei := {ei, ej} := gij = 2δij(−1)i+1

while (cid:8)ei, ej(cid:9) = 2δi

j and

( e2

2i−1 = 1
e2
2i

= −1

i = 1, . . . , m .

(1)

The Witt, or null, basis of the vector space V is deﬁned, for both ﬁelds:

( pi = 1

qi = 1

2 (e2i−1 − e2i) ⇒ ( e2i−1 = pi + qi
2 (e2i−1 + e2i)

= pi − qi

e2i

i = 1, 2, . . . , m (2)

that, with eiej = −ejei, easily gives

{pi, pj} = {qi, qj} = 0

{pi, qj} = δij

(3)

i = q2

showing that all pi, qi are mutually orthogonal, also to themselves, that
implies p2
i = 0, at the origin of the name “null” given to these vectors.
Following Chevalley we deﬁne spinors as elements of a Minimal Left
Ideal S; simple spinors are those elements of S that are annihilated by a
null subspace of V of maximal dimension m.

3

The EFB of Cℓ(m, m) is given by the 22m diﬀerent sequences

ψ1ψ2 · · · ψm := Ψ

ψi ∈ {qipi, piqi, pi, qi}

i = 1, . . . , m

(4)

in which each ψi can take four diﬀerent values and we reserve Ψ for EFB
elements and ψi for its components. The main characteristics of EFB is that
all its 22m elements Ψ are simple spinors [4].

The EFB essentially extends to the entire algebra the Fock basis of its
m
spinor spaces and, making explicit the relation Cℓ(m, m) ∼=
⊗Cℓ(1, 1), allows
one to trace back in Cℓ(1, 1) many properties of Cℓ(m, m). We stress that
this constitutes a base of the algebra itself and not of its representations and
the matrix formalism, with row and column indexes, emerges right from the
algebra.

2.1 h and g signatures

We start observing that e2i−1e2i = qipi − piqi := [qi, pi] and that for i 6= j
[qi, pi] ψj = ψj [qi, pi]. With (3) and (4) it is easy to calculate

[qi, pi] ψi = hiψi

hi = ( +1

−1

iﬀ ψi = qipi or qi
iﬀ ψi = piqi or pi

(5)

and the value of hi depends on the ﬁrst null vector appearing in ψi. We
have thus proved that [qi, pi] Ψ = hiΨ and each EFB element Ψ deﬁnes thus
a vector (h1, h2, . . . , hm) ∈ {±1}m that we name “h signature”. In EFB the
identity 1 and the volume element ω (scalar and pseudoscalar) have similar
expressions:

1 := {q1, p1} {q2, p2} · · · {qm, pm}
ω := e1e2 · · · e2m = [q1, p1] [q2, p2] · · · [qm, pm]

with which and deﬁning a function ǫ : {±1}m → {±1}, ǫ(h) = Qm

η := ǫ(h) = ±1 .

ωΨ = η Ψ

i=1 hi

(6)

Each EFB element Ψ has thus an eigenvalue η: the chirality. Similarly the “g
signature” of an EFB element is the vector (g1, g2, . . . , gm) ∈ {±1}m where
gi is the parity of ψi under the main algebra automorphism α(ei) = −ei
(17). With this deﬁnition and with (5) we easily derive

ψi [qi, pi] = gi [qi, pi] ψi = higiψi

(7)

and thus

ηθ = ±1

Ψ ω = ηθ Ψ

(8)
where the eigenvalue ηθ is the product of chirality times θ, the global parity
of the EFB element Ψ under the main algebra automorphism. We can
resume saying that all EFB elements are not only Weyl eigenvectors, i.e.
right eigenvectors of ω (6), but also its left eigenvectors (8) with respective
eigenvalues η and ηθ, a property we will use in what follows.

θ := ǫ(g)

4

2.2 EFB formalism

h and g signatures play a crucial role in this description of Cℓ(m, m): ﬁrst
of all one easily sees that any EFB element Ψ = ψ1ψ2 · · · ψm is uniquely
identiﬁed by its h and g signatures: hi determines the ﬁrst null vector (qi
or pi) appearing in ψi and gi determines if ψi is even or odd, see (4).

It can be shown [2] that Cℓ(m, m), as a vector space, is the direct sum

of its 2m subspaces of:

• diﬀerent h signatures or:

• diﬀerent g signatures or:

• diﬀerent h◦g signatures, where h◦g ∈ {±1}m is the Hadamard (entry-
wise) product of h and g signature vectors; h ◦ g = (h1g1, . . . , hmgm).

We can thus uniquely identify each of the 22m EFB elements with any
two of these three “indices”. For reasons that will be clear in a moment we
choose the h and the h ◦ g signatures i.e.

Ψab( a ∈ {±1}m is the h signature

b ∈ {±1}m is the h ◦ g signature

(9)

so that the generic element of µ ∈ Cℓ(m, m) can be written as µ = Pab ξabΨab

with ξab ∈ F. With this choice of the indices one can prove [2] that:

ΨabΨcd = s(a, b, d) δbcΨad

s(a, b, d) = ±1

(10)

where δbc is 1 if and only if the two signatures b and c are equal and the
sign s(a, b, d), slightly tedious to calculate, depends on the indices; in [2] it
is shown how it can be calculated via matrix isomorphism. This formula
explains the choice of h ◦ g signature since it is clear that diﬀerent h ◦ g
signatures identify diﬀerent MLI and thus diﬀerent spinor spaces, denoted
Shg for short. One can thus calculate the most general Cliﬀord product

µν =  Xab
= Xad

ξabΨab! Xcd
ΨadXb

ζcdΨcd! = Xabcd
s(a, b, d)ξabζbd := Xad

ξabζcdΨabΨcd =

ρadΨad

having deﬁned ρad = Pb s(a, b, d)ξabζbd.

So EFB elements naturally display a matrix structure, mirrored in the
isomorphic full matrix algebra F(2m), where a and b are respectively the row
and column indices of Ψab when interpreted as binary numbers substituting:
1 → 0 and −1 → 1. Let

f := (−1, −1, −1, . . . , −1) ∈ {±1}m

5

then, with the proposed substitutions, −f gives the binary expression of 0
and f that of 2m − 1, see [2]; moreover by (6), (8) and (9)

η(Ψab) = ǫ(a)
θ(Ψab) = ǫ(a)ǫ(b) .

(11)

As an example we give the EFB for Cℓ(2, 2) ∼= Cℓ(3, 1) ∼= R(4) with h

(rows) and h ◦ g (columns) signatures (taken from [2]):

(12)

where the signs in the matrix elements come from (10); with (2) and (4) we
can write the standard ei base in EFB as a sum of 2m = 4 EFB terms

e1 = (p1 + q1) = (p1 + q1) {p2, q2}
e2 = (p1 − q1) = (p1 − q1) {p2, q2}
e3 = (p2 + q2) = {p1, q1} (p2 + q2)
e4 = (p2 − q2) = {p1, q1} (p2 − q2)

and we can easily write

and with EFB we can interpret the nonzero terms of these matrices as the
simple spinors building up vectors ei’s; moreover it’s simple to identify the
two null vectors pi and qi in each of them.

We can exploit these expressions further to prove some fairly general

properties of ei’s; writing

ei = (cid:16)pi + (−1)i+1qi(cid:17)

{pj, qj}

Yj=1

j6=i

(13)

we notice that it expands in a sum of exactly 2m simple spinors, all with
identical g signature g = (1, . . . , 1, −1, 1, . . . , 1) with the unique −1 at the

6

i-th place. It is clear that EFB terms of the sum cover all 2m possible h
signatures and all possible h ◦ g signatures, each “column” and each “row”
being ﬁlled exactly once in a pattern similar to that of a permutation matrix.
To show the power of this formulation we prove that e.g. Tr (ei) = 0: one
sees immediately that all diagonal terms, those with identical h and h ◦ g
signatures, are forbidden since g 6= −f. One can continue proving, within
the algebra, other familiar properties of gamma matrices.

As a side remark we observe that this formulation provides the faster
algorithm for actual Cliﬀord product evaluations [1] resulting a factor 2m
faster than algorithms based on gamma matrices.

We have shown that for neutral spaces matrix multiplication rules are
integral part of Cliﬀord algebra without the need to resort to representations.

3 Multiple spinor spaces

We already mentioned that Cℓ(m, m), as a vector space, is the direct sum
of subspaces of diﬀerent h ◦ g signatures [2]. Given the Cliﬀord product
properties (10) these subspaces are also MLI of Cℓ(m, m) and thus coincide
with 2m diﬀerent spinor spaces Shg that in turn correspond to diﬀerent
columns of the isomorphic matrix algebra F(2m). Each of the 2m spinor
spaces supports a regular faithful and irreducible representation of Cℓ(m, m)
and since the algebra is simple there exist isomorphisms intertwining the
representations. This subject certainly deserves deeper investigations also in
view that multiple spinor spaces Shg have been proposed for mirror particles
[10]. We follow this track and show how, under certain transformations,
spinors can move between diﬀerent spinor spaces.

Let us choose a particular spinor space, e.g. h ◦ g = f, the rightmost
column in example (12), so that when we speak of a generic spinor we will
refer to spinor space Sf (used to build the Fock basis in [4]). Its generic
element ϕ ∈ Sf can thus be expanded in the Fock basis

ξaf Ψaf

ϕ = Xa

(14)

and, since the second index f is constant, it could also be omitted.

One is frequently interested in solving equations like vϕ = 0 where v ∈ V
and ϕ ∈ S as are for example the solutions of the Weyl’s equation. We
remark that if a particular ϕ ∈ Sf solves the equation then the equation
is solved also by all ϕ′ corresponding to ϕ moved in all possible spinor
spaces Sf ′

6= Sf . Namely if vϕ = vPa ξaΨaf = 0 then, by (10), also
0 = vPa ξaΨaf ′ = vϕ′ for all f ′; we will return to this point in paragraph 5.

3.1 Representations of Cliﬀord algebra Cℓ(g)

We resume some quite general properties we need in the sequel:
let γ :
Cℓ(g) → EndS be a faithful irreducible representation of Cℓ(g) and let β be
the so called main antiautomorphism

β(µν) = νµ
β(v)
= v
β(1) = 1

∀ µ, ν ∈ Cℓ(g)
∀ v ∈ V

(15)




that reverses the order of multiplication and that is involutive. With β it
is possible to deﬁne the contragredient representation in S∗, the dual of S,
ˇγ : Cℓ(g) → EndS∗ given by ˇγ(µ) = γ (β(µ))∗ and, since in our case V
is even dimensional, Cℓ(g) is simple and central and thus there exists an
isomorphism B : S → S∗ intertwining the two representations: ˇγB = Bγ
which is either symmetric B = B∗ or antisymmetric B = −B∗ [4, 7] and
that also deﬁnes on S the structure of an inner product space (h·, ·i represents
the bilinear product or contraction)

S × S → F

B(ϕ, φ) := hBϕ, φi ∈ F .

This structure extends to EndS: there is a symmetric isomorphism B⊗B−1 :
EndS → (EndS)∗ = EndS∗ given, for every γ ∈ EndS, by (B ⊗ B−1)(γ) =
BγB−1.

4 Automorphisms of Cliﬀord algebra Cℓ(g)

We begin with a general proposition and thus in this section there are no
restrictions on the dimensions of the vector space V .

Proposition 1. For a Cliﬀord algebra over ﬁelds R and C all its automor-
phisms are inner if and only if the dimension of the vector space is even.

Proof. In a nutshell for any non degenerate vector space V over R or C its
universal Cliﬀord algebra exists and is either a full matrix algebra M or the
direct sum of two such algebras that are isomorphic, i.e. either Cℓ(g) ∼= M or
Cℓ(g) ∼= M ⊕ M ′ with M ∼= M ′ [3].
If the vector space is even dimensional
Cℓ(g) ∼= M and the algebra is always central simple [3] and, by Skolem –
Noether theorem, all its automorphisms are inner. To prove the converse,
that for all odd dimensional vector spaces there are always non inner au-
tomorphism, we start by the complex ﬁeld C, in this case for V = C2m−1
then Cℓ(g) ∼= C(2m−1) ⊕ C(2m−1) and it’s easy to see that the automorphism
that swaps the two parts α(z1, z2) = (z2, z1) (hyperbolic involution) can not
be inner (while it results inner for the “successive” Cliﬀord algebra over
V = C2m and Cℓ(g) ∼= C(2m)).

8

In the real case V = Rp,q the same argument applies to p − q ≡ 1, 5
(mod 8) when, respectively, Cℓ(g) ∼= R(r) ⊕ R(r) and Cℓ(g) ∼= H(r) ⊕ H(r),
It remains only the case p − q ≡ 3, 7 (mod 8) then Cℓ(g) ∼=
for some r.
C(r) and the algebra is simple but not central since the center is C. Any
automorphism α must map the center onto itself, so the restriction of α to
C is necessarily an R-linear automorphism of C and it is therefore either the
identity or complex conjugation; if the restriction is the identity then α is a
C-linear automorphism and for Skolem – Noether theorem it is inner. But
if the restriction is complex conjugation, then composing α with complex
conjugation yields a C-linear automorphism, which must be inner. But our
algebra is real and the complex ﬁeld, considered as a real algebra, has no
inner automorphism providing complex conjugation, so in all these cases α
alone is not inner. ✷

An example of non inner automorphism is CℓR(0, 1) ∼= C where the main
automorphism α(v) = −v coincides with complex conjugation and is thus
not inner.

A corollary that follows from the universality of Cliﬀord algebras is that
all orthogonal transformations on an even dimensional V lift to inner auto-
morphisms of Cℓ(g). This corollary proves in a diﬀerent fashion, and only
for even dimensional spaces, the result quoted in [14] that all “fundamental
automorphisms”, even discrete ones like P and T , are inner automorphisms
(and without using representations).

So in even dimensional spaces

Aut (Cℓ(g)) = {x ∈ Cℓ(g) : ∃x−1} := C ⋆
g

(16)

g : xvx−1 ∈ V ∀v ∈ V },
and its subgroup that stabilise vectors, Cg = {x ∈ C ⋆
is the Cliﬀord group that, restricted on vector space V , is the orthogonal
group O (g) since it preserves scalar product.

There are in general four fundamental automorphisms corresponding to
the involutions and antinvolutions induced by vector space V orthogonal
transformations 1V and −1V [13, Theorem 15.32] and they form a ﬁnite
group, isomorphic to the Gauss – Klein group Z2 ⊗ Z2 [14]. We review
them brieﬂy to show how they appear in EFB formalism and to exhibit the
elements of C ⋆

g realizing the inner automorphisms.

From here we restrict again to even dimensional, neutral, spaces since

EFB formalism is fully developed in this case.

4.1 Main automorphism of Cℓ(g)

The main automorphism α of Cℓ(g) (main involution in Porteous [13]) is
induced by V orthogonal transformation −1V , namely

α(v) = −v ∀ v ∈ V

(17)

9

it is involutive and deﬁnes the basic Z2 grading of Cℓ(g).

It’s easy to show that given the volume element ω = e1 · · · en one obtains
ωei = (−1)(n−1)eiω and so that for even dimensional spaces one has ωvω−1 =
−v for any v ∈ V , where ω−1 = ω3 = ±ω, and thus in this case the main
automorphism on the entire algebra may be written as:

α(µ) = ωµω−1 .

For the EFB expansion µ = Pab ξabΨab one ﬁnds with (6), (8) and (11)

α(Ψab) = ωΨabω−1 = θabΨab = ǫ(a)ǫ(b)Ψab

(18)

where θab = ±1 is the global parity of the EFB element Ψab deﬁned in (8).
One can double check this formula verifying that vectors, when written
in EFB formalism, satisfy (17): let us take e.g. the vector ei, by (13) it can
be written in EFB as a sum of 2m EFB terms
m

ωeiω−1 = ω(cid:16)pi + (−1)i+1qi(cid:17)

{pj, qj} ω−1

Yj=1

j6=i

and since for any i {qi, pi} ω = ω {qi, pi} and ω−1 = ±ω

ωeiω−1 = ω(cid:16)pi + (−1)i+1qi(cid:17) ω−1

m

Yj=1

j6=i

{pj, qj} = −ei

that easily generalizes to any vector.

4.2 Reversion automorphism of Cℓ(g)

The main antiautomorphism β (15) is the antiautomorphism induced by V
orthogonal transformation 1V (reversion in Porteous [13]) and it becomes
an automorphism when transposed to the dual space and coincides with the
contragredient representation ˇγ(µ).
If S is a MLI of Cℓ(g), the space of
spinors, and γ the regular representation γ(µ) = µ, then ˇγ(µ) = β(µ)∗; its
main property is:

ˇγ(ei1 · · · eik) = e∗

i1 · · · e∗
ik

.

Since it is an automorphism it must be inner, thus there exists τ ∈ Cℓ(g)
such that ˇγ(µ) = τ µτ −1 and τ is fully deﬁned by its action on the generators
j it easily follows that
ˇγ(ei) = e∗
i = e−1
It is a simple exercise to get the explicit form of τ that
e∗
depends on the parity of m

i = τ eiτ −1 and since {e∗

i , ej } = gi

i = e3
i .

j = 2δi

τ = ( e2e4 · · · e2m

for m even
for m odd

= (p1 + s q1) (p2 + s q2) · · · (pm + s qm)

s = (−1)m+1 .

10

To evaluate the reversion automorphism on EFB elements we easily get

ˇγ(Ψab) = β(Ψab)∗ = β(ψ1ψ2 · · · ψm)∗ = ψ′

ψ′

(19)

i = e−1

i. By (15) β(pi) = pi, β(qi) = qi so that β(piqi) = qipi
where β(ψi) := ψ′
by (2) one obtains that (pi)∗ = qi,
and β(qipi) = piqi. Since e∗
(piqi)∗ = piqi and (qipi)∗ = qipi. We can resume saying that the gi and
∗ are respectively equal to gi and −hi of that of ψi so
hi signatures of ψ′
i
that the eﬀect of reversion automorphism is to change sign to both h and
h ◦ g signatures. We can thus conclude that for the reversion (inner)
automorphism we have

i

β(Ψab)∗ = τΨabτ −1 = Ψ−a−b

(20)

and we remark that while Ψab belongs to spinor space Sb, β(Ψab)∗ belongs
to S−b, always a diﬀerent spinor space, the main result of this paper.

With similar exercises one obtains:

β(Ψab) = s′(a, b)Ψ−b−a

s′(a, b) = ±1

(21)

where the sign s′(a, b), straightforward, if slightly tedious to calculate, de-
pends on the indices; one can easily double check that it satisﬁes main
antiautomorphism properties (15). One also obtains

Ψ∗

ab = s′(a, b)Ψba

s′(a, b) = ±1

(22)

that could also be deduced directly from the natural matrix structure of the
EFB with (10); combining both these formulas one reobtains (20). Since
both (21) and (22) are involutive one has

s′(a, b) = s′(b, a) = s′(−b, −a) = s′(−a, −b) .

4.3 Conjugation automorphism of Cℓ(g)

The composition of the main and reversion automorphisms is called conju-
gation and with (18) and (20)

α (β(Ψab)∗) = ωτΨab(ωτ)−1 = θabΨ−a−b

(23)

since θ−a−b = θab given that also this automorphism is involutive.

4.4 A simple example in Cℓ(1, 1)

We conclude with a simple example in Cℓ(1, 1) where the EFB is formed by 4
elements: {qp++, pq−−, p−+, q+−} where the subscripts indicate respectively
h and h ◦ g signatures; its EFB matrix is

+ −
q

pq!

+ qp
− p

 

11

and the generic element µ ∈ Cℓ(1, 1) can be written as

µ = ξ++qp++ + ξ−−pq−− + ξ−+p−+ + ξ+−q+−

ξ ∈ F

and the application of the three inner automorphisms gives

ωµω−1
= ξ++qp++ + ξ−−pq−− − ξ−+p−+ − ξ+−q+−
τ µτ −1
= ξ−−qp++ + ξ++pq−− + ξ+−p−+ + ξ−+q+−
ωτ µ(ωτ)−1 = ξ−−qp++ + ξ++pq−− − ξ+−p−+ − ξ−+q+−

and ω = e1e2 = [q, p], τ = e1 = p + q, ωτ = −e2 = q − p and 1 = e2
1 =
{q, p}. For comparison, the same automorphisms applied to the standard ei
formulation gives the ordinary results

µ
ωµω−1
τ µτ −1
ωτ µ(ωτ)−1 = ξ01 − ξ1e1 + ξ2e2 − ξ12e1e2 .

= ξ01 + ξ1e1 + ξ2e2 + ξ12e1e2
= ξ01 − ξ1e1 − ξ2e2 + ξ12e1e2
= ξ01 + ξ1e1 − ξ2e2 − ξ12e1e2

ξ ∈ F

5 Spinor transformations

We begin observing that if also complex conjugation is taken into account
things get a little bit more complex since the ﬁnite group of fundamental
automorphism doubles its size and have been examined in detail in [15] but
we leave aside for the moment this further level of complexity and examine
what’s going on in our simpler case since it is enough for our purpose of
studying general properties of spinor transformations.

The inner automorphisms of section 4 are fully general and their restric-
tions to V correspond to the V transformations: 1V , P , T and P T . It is
simple to see that the restriction of the identity to V is 1V and that of the
main automorphism (17), (18) is P T . On the other hand reversion (20)
and conjugation (23) restricted to V correspond to P and T but the exact
identiﬁcation is a little tricky depending on V signature and on the corre-
sponding Cℓ(g). But we can postpone the exact identiﬁcation since both
these automorphisms change also the spinorial space supporting the regular
representation of Cℓ(g) both sending Ψab to Ψ−a−b and in any case b 6= −b.

It is evocative to write the general form of these elements in EFB

1 = {q1, p1} {q2, p2} · · · {qm, pm}
ω = [q1, p1] [q2, p2] · · · [qm, pm]
τ = (p1 + s q1) (p2 + s q2) · · · (pm + s qm)

s = (−1)m+1

ωτ = (−1)m (p1 − s q1) (p2 − s q2) · · · (pm − s qm)

and the ﬁrst two result: even under the main automorphism, do not move
spinor spaces and form a group isomorphic to Z2 that gives Cℓ(g) grading.

12

The last two, have parity (−1)m under the main automorphism, move spinor
spaces and form, together with the ﬁrst two, the group of discrete automor-
phisms isomorphic to the Gauss – Klein group Z2 ⊗ Z2. Moreover with (11)
and observing that ǫ(−x) = (−1)mǫ(x) one ﬁnds

η(Ψ−a−b) = (−1)mη(Ψab)
θ(Ψ−a−b) = θ(Ψab)

showing that, when m is odd, the chirality is reversed by automorphisms
that move spinor spaces; a subtler study is needed to generalize this result
from neutral spaces to spaces of diﬀerent signature.

To investigate how these inner automorphisms behave on generic spinors

(14) and not only on EFB elements we give a simple result:

Proposition 2. for any inner automorphism α ∈ C ⋆
is a MLI, moreover xShgx−1 = Shg if and only if Shgx−1 = Shg.

g the image of a MLI

Proof. The ﬁrst part descend immediately from the fact that a MLI must
have rank 1; for the second part let xShgx−1 = Shg, then since Shg is a MLI
we have also Shgx−1 = Shg; viceversa let Shgx−1 = Shg, since Shg is a MLI
xShg = Shg and thus xShgx−1 = Shg. ✷

Thus since for any spinor ϕ = ϕ1 the identity do not change spinor space.
Going to P T by (14), (8) and (11) and remembering that ω−1 = ω3

ϕω−1 = ω2Xa

ξaf Ψaf ω = ω2Xa

ξaf ǫ(f)Ψaf = ω2ǫ(f)ϕ = ±ϕ

and so both 1V and P T behave as expected also on generic spinors of Sf .
The eﬀect of reversion automorphism (20) on a generic spinor is

τ ϕτ −1 = Xa

ξaf Ψ−a−f

and if ϕ has a deﬁned chirality, ωϕ = η ϕ, then with (6) and (11)

ωτ ϕτ −1 =Xa

ǫ(−a)ξaf Ψ−a−f = (−1)mητ ϕτ −1 .

We consider now the solutions of equations like vϕ = 0, where v ∈ V and
ϕ ∈ S. We observe that they must remain the same under any injective map
and thus xvϕx−1 = 0 if and only if vϕ = 0 and thus ϕx−1 = 0 only if ϕ = 0.
As it was intuitive, inner automorphisms do not change solutions of vϕ = 0;
in particular the solutions of xvϕ = 0 are equal to those of xvϕx−1 = 0.

We conclude with a ﬁrst characterization of the transformations that do

not move a given spinor space:

Proposition 3. The automorphims such that xSf x−1 = Sf form a group
that is a normal subgroup of C ⋆

g (16).

13

g : xSf x−1 = Sf } and let x ∈ Cf , by previous
Proof. Let Cf := {x ∈ C ⋆
proposition we know that Sf x−1 = Sf and right multiplying by x we get
Sf = Sf x with which we prove that also x−1Sf x = Sf i.e. that also x−1 ∈
Cf . Let x, y ∈ Cf then xySf y−1x−1 = Sf thus also xy ∈ Cf .

It is obvious that Cf ≤ C ⋆

g and that it is a normal subgroup since any
element yx of the left coset yCf can be seen as an element xy′ of the right
coset Cf y choosing y′ = x−1yx and xy′ = yx. ✷

We remark that in general if x leaves invariant spinor space Sf nothing
can be said on its properties on a diﬀerent Sf ′. The study of this group will
be the subject of a forthcoming companion paper.

6 Conclusions

We have seen that all orthogonal transformations of an even dimensional
vector space V can be seen as the restrictions of inner automorphisms of
Cℓ(g). We are thus allowed to assume that also a spinor ϕ must transform
as xϕx−1 and that, in some cases like e.g. P and T , this has the eﬀect of
moving spinor ϕ from spinor space Sf to spinor space S−f . This has no
eﬀect at all on the solutions of equations like vϕ = 0 but the moved spinor
xϕx−1 may have opposite chirality.

The perspectives appear promising but many things remain to be done
to complete this study, one for all the classiﬁcation of continuous transfor-
mations of V since it is a simple exercise to verify that whereas all auto-
morphisms generated by an odd number of generators, like e.g. ϕ → eiϕe−1
,
move the spinor space of ϕ, automorphisms where the generators appear in
couples, like e.g. ϕ → (e2i−1e2i)ϕ(e2i−1e2i)−1, do not move the spinor space
of ϕ. This and other issues will be tackled in a successive paper.
