A CLASS OF FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS ON MONOIDS

BOUIKHALENE BELAID AND ELQORACHI ELHOUCIEN

Abstract. In [8] B. Ebanks and H. Stetkær obtained the solutions of the
functional equation f (xy) − f (σ(y)x) = g(x)h(y) where σ is an involutive
automorphism and f, g, h are complex-valued functions, in the setting of a
group G and a monoid M . Our main goal is to determine the complex-valued
solutions of the following more general version of this equation, viz f (xy) −
µ(y)f (σ(y)x) = g(x)h(y) where µ : G −→ C is a multiplicative function such
that µ(xσ(x)) = 1 for all x ∈ G. As an application we ﬁnd the complex-valued
solutions (f, g, h) on groups of the equation f (xy) + µ(y)g(σ(y)x) = h(x)h(y).

1. Introduction

We recall that a semigroup S is a set equipped with an associative operation.
We write the operation multiplicatively. A monoid is a semigroup M with identity
element that we denote e. A function χ : S −→ C is said to be multiplicative if
χ(xy) = χ(x)χ(y) for all x, y ∈ S.
Let S be a semigroup and σ : G −→ G an involutive homomorphism, that is
σ(xy) = σ(x)σ(y) and σ(σ(x)) = x for all x, y ∈ G.
The complex-valued solutions of the following variant of d’Alembert’s functional
equation

(1.1)

f (xy) + f (σ(y)x) = 2f (x)f (y), x, y ∈ S.

was determined by Stetkær [14]. They are the functions of the form

f (x) =

χ + χ ◦ σ

2

,

where χ : G −→ C is multiplictive.
In the same year, Ebanks and Stetkær [8] obtained on monoids the complex-valued
solutions of the following d’Alembert’s other functional equation

(1.2)

f (xy) − f (σ(y)x) = g(x)h(y), x, y ∈ S.

This functional equation contains, among others, an equation of d’Alembert [2, 3, 4]

(1.3)

f (x + y) − f (x − y) = g(x)h(y), x, y ∈ R

the solutions of which are known on abelian groups, and a functional equation

(1.4)

f (x + y) − f (x + σ(y)) = g(x)h(y), x, y ∈ G

studied by Stetkær [12, Corollary III.5] on abelian groups G.
There are various ways of extending functional equations from abelian groups to
non-abelian groups. The µ-d’Alembert functional equation

(1.5)

f (xy) + µ(y)f (xτ (y)) = 2f (x)f (y), x, y ∈ G

which is an extension of d’Alembert functional equation

(1.6)

f (xy) + f (xτ (y)) = 2f (x)f (y), x, y ∈ G,

where τ is an involutive of G, is closely related to pre-d’Alembert functions.
It
occurs in the literature. See Parnami, Singh and Vasudeva [10], Davison [5, Propo-
sition 2.11], Ebanks and Stetkær [6], Stetkær [15, Lemma IV.4] and Yang [16,
Proposition 4.2]. The functional equation (1.5) has been treated systematically by
Stetkær [15]. The non-zero solutions of (1.5) are the normalized traces of certain
representations of G on C2. Davison proved this via his work [5] on the pre-
d’Alembert functional equation on monoids.
The variant of Wilson’s functional equation

(1.7)

(1.8)

f (xy) + µ(y)f (τ (y)x) = 2f (x)g(y), x, y ∈ G;

f (xy) + µ(y)f (σ(y)x) = 2f (x)g(y), x, y ∈ G

with µ 6= 1 was recently studied on groups by Elqorachi and Redouani [9].
The complex-valued solutions of equation (1.7) with τ (x) = x−1 and µ(x) = 1 for
all x ∈ G are obtained on groups by Ebanks and Stetkær [6].
The present paper complements and contains the existing results about (1.2) by
ﬁnding the solutions f, g, h of the extension

(1.9)

f (xy) − µ(y)f (σ(y)x) = g(x)h(y), x, y ∈ S

of it to monoids that need not be abelian, because on non-abelian monoids the
order of factors matters and involutions and involutive automorphisms diﬀer.
As in [8] one of the main ideas is to relate the functional equation (1.2) to a sine
substraction law on monoids. In our case we need the solutions of the following
version of the sine subtraction law

(1.10)

µ(y)f (xσ(y)) = f (x)g(y) − f (y)g(x), x, y ∈ S.

These results are obtained in Theorem 2.1. We need also the solutions of equation
(1.8) on monoids. There are not in the literature, but we derived them in Theorem
3.2. In section 4 we obtain on of the main results about (1.9). Furthermore, as an
application we ﬁnd the complex-valued solutions (f, g, h) of the functional equation

(1.11)

f (xy) + µ(y)g(σ(y)x) = h(x)h(y), x, y ∈ G

on groups and monoids in terms of multiplicative and additive functions.

1.1. Notation and preliminary matters. Throughout this paper G denotes a
group and S a semigroup. A monoid is a semigroup M with an identity element
that we denote e. The map σ : S −→ S denotes an involutive automorphism. That
it is involutive means that σ(σ(x)) = x for all x ∈ S. The mapping µ : S −→ C is
a multiplicative function such that µ(xσ(x)) = 1 for all x ∈ S. If χ : S −→ C is
a multiplicative function such that χ 6= 0, then Iχ = {x ∈ S | χ(x) = 0} is either
empty or a proper subset of S. Furthermore, Iχ is a two-sided ideal in S if not
empty and S\Iχ is a subsemigroup of S. If S is a topological space, then we let
C(S) denote the algebra of continuous functions from S into C.
For later use we need the following results. The next proposition corresponds to
Lemma 3.4 in [8].

Proposition 1.1. Let S be a semigroup, and suppose f, g : S −→ C satisfy the
sine addition law

(1.12)

f (xy) = f (x)g(y) + f (y)g(x), x, y ∈ S

FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS ON MONOIDS

with f 6= 0. Then there exist multiplicative functions χ1, χ2 : G −→ C such that

g =

χ1 + χ2

2

.

Additionally we have the following
i) If χ1 6= χ2 , then f = c(χ1 − χ2) for some constant c ∈ C \ {0}.
ii) If χ1 = χ2, then letting χ := χ1 we have g = χ. If S is a semigroup such that
S = {xy ∈: x, y ∈ S} (for instance a monoid), then χ 6= 0.
If S is a group, then there is an additive function A : S −→ C, A 6= 0, such that
f = χA.
If S is a semigroup which is generated by its squares, then there exists an additive
function A : S \ Iχ −→ C for which

f (x) = (cid:26) χ(x)A(x) f or x ∈ S \ Iχ

f or x ∈ Iχ.

0

Furthermore, if S is a topological group, or if S is a topological semigroup generated
by its squares, and f, g ∈ C(S), then χ1, χ2, χ ∈ C(S). In the group case A ∈ C(S)
and in the second case A ∈ C(S \ Iχ).

2. µ-sine subtraction law on a group and on a monoid

In this section we deal with a new version of the sine subtraction law

(2.1)

µ(y)k(xσ(y)) = k(x)l(y) − k(y)l(x), x, y ∈ S,

where k, l are complex valued functions and µ is a multiplicative function. The
new feature is the introduction of the function µ. We shall say that k satisﬁes the
µ-sine subtraction law with companion function l. If S is a topological semigroup
and k, l satisfy (2.1) such that k 6= 0 and k is a continuous function then l is also
a continuous function. In the case where µ = 1 and G is a topological group, the
functional equation (2.1) was solved in [8].
Here we focus exclusively on (2.1), and we include nothing about other extensions
of the cosine, sine addition and subtraction laws. The next theorem is the analogue
of Theorem 3.2 in [8].

Theorem 2.1. Let G be a group and let σ : G −→ C be a involutive automorphism.
Let µ : G −→ C be a multiplicative function such that µ(xσ(x)) = 1 for all x ∈ G.
The solution k, l : G −→ C of the µ-sine subtraction law (2.1) with k 6= 0 are
the following pairs of functions, where χ : G −→ C \ {0} denotes a character and
c1 ∈ C, c2 ∈ C \ {0} are constants.
i) If χ 6= µ χ ◦ σ, then

k = c2

χ − µ χ ◦ σ

2

, l =

χ + µ χ ◦ σ

2

+ c1

χ − µ χ ◦ σ

2

.

ii) If χ = µ χ ◦ σ, then

k = χA,

l = χ(1 + c1A)

where A : G −→ C is an additive function such that A ◦ σ = −A 6= 0.
Furthermore, if G is a topological group and k ∈ C(G), then l, χ, µ χ ◦ σ, A ∈ C(G).

Proof. By interchanging x and y in (2.1) we get that µ(x)k(yσ(x)) = −µ(y)k(xσ(y))
for all x, y ∈ G. By setting y = e we get that k(x) = −µ(x)k(σ(x)) for all x ∈ G.

4

B. BOUIKHALENE AND E. ELQORACHI

Using this, equation (2.1) and the fact that µ(xσ(x)) = 1 we get for all x, y ∈ G
that

k(x)[l(y) − µ(y)l(σ(y))] − k(y)[l(x) − µ(x)l(σ(x))]
= k(x)l(y) − µ(y)k(x)l(σ(y)) − k(y)l(x) + µ(x)k(y)l(σ(y))
= µ(y)k(xσ(y) + µ(xy)k(σ(x))l(σ(y)) − µ(xy)k(σ(y))l(σ(x))

= µ(y)k(xσ(y)) + µ(xy)[k(σ(x))l(σ(y)) − k(σ(y))l(σ(x))]

= µ(y)k(xσ(y)) + µ(xy)µ(σ(y))k(σ(x)y)

= µ(y)k(xσ(y)) + µ(x)k(σ(x)y)
= mu(y)k(xσ(y)) − µ(x)µ(σ(x)y)k(xσ(y))
= µ(y)k(xσ(y)) − µ(y)k(xσ(y))
= 0.

So that we get for all x, y ∈ G that

(2.2)

k(x)[l(y) − µ(y)l(σ(y))] = k(y)[l(x) − µ(x)l(σ(x))].

By using some ideas from [8] we let l+(x) = l(x)+µ(x)l(σ(x))
for all x ∈ G. We have l = l+ + l−, l+(σ(x)) = µ(σ(x))l+(x) and l−(σ(x)) =
−µ(σ(x))l−(x) for all x ∈ G. From (2.2) we have for all x, y ∈ G that k(x)l−(y) =
k(y)l−(x). Since k 6= 0 there exists an x0 ∈ G such that k(x0) 6= 0. Thus we have
l−(y) = l−(x0)
k(x0) k(y) = ck(y) for all y ∈ G. Then l− = ck. On the other hand by
replacing l by l+ + l− in (2.1) and by using k(x)l−(y) = k(y)l−(x) we get that

and l−(x) = l(x)−µ(x)l(σ(x))

2

2

(2.3)

µ(y)k(xσ(y)) = k(x)l+(y) − k(y)l+(x), x, y ∈ G

Replacing y by σ(y) in (2.3) we get that

(2.4)

k(xy) = k(x)l+(y) + k(y)l+(x), x, y ∈ G.

2

According to Proposition 1.1 we have
either i) or ii) k = c1(χ1 − χ2) and l+ = χ1+χ2
where c1 ∈ C \ {0}. Since k(x) =
−µ(x)k(σ(x)) and l+(x) = µ(x)l+(σ(x)) for all x ∈ G we get that c1(χ1 − χ2) =
−c1µ(χ1 ◦ σ − χ2 ◦ σ) and µ(χ1 ◦ σ + χ2 ◦ σ) = χ1 + χ2. Then χ2 = µχ1 ◦ σ,
l+ = χ1+µχ1 ◦σ
χ1−µχ1 ◦σ
where c2 ∈ C \ {0}. By using the fact l = l− + l+ we get (i).
ii) we have l+ = χ and k = χA. Since l+(σ(x)) = µ(σ(x))l+(x) for all x ∈ G we get
that χ = µχ ◦ σ. From k(x) = −µ(x)k(σ(x)) for all x ∈ G we get that A = −A ◦ σ.
By using the fact l = l− + l+ = cχA + χ = χ(cA + 1). This completes the proof. (cid:3)

and k = c1

In the next proposition we extend Theorem 2.1 to monoids.

Proposition 2.2. Let M be a monoid and let σ : M −→ M be a involutive
automorphism. Let µ : M −→ C be a multiplicative function such that µ(xσ(x)) = 1
for all x ∈ M . The solution k, l : M −→ C of the µ-sine subtraction law (2.1) with
k 6= 0 are the following pairs of functions, where χ : M −→ C \ {0} denotes a
multiplicative function and χ(e) = 1 and c1 ∈ C, c2 ∈ C \ {0} are constants :
i) If χ 6= µ χ ◦ σ, then

k = c1

χ − µ χ ◦ σ

χ + µ χ ◦ σ

ii) If χ = µ χ ◦ σ and S is generated by its squares, then

k(x) = χ(x)A(x),

l(x) = χ(x)(1 + c1A(x)) ∀x ∈ M \Iχ

l(x) = k(x) = 0,

∀x ∈ Iχ

where A : M −→ C \ {0} is an additive function such that A ◦ σ = −A 6= 0.
Furthermore, if M is a topological monoid, and k ∈ C(M ), then l, χ, µχ ◦ σ ∈ C(M )
and A ∈ C(M \Iχ).

Proof. By the same way in Proposition 3.6 in [8] and by using Theorem 2.1 and
the Proposition 1.1 we get the proof.
(cid:3)

3. A variant of Wilson’s functional equation on monoids

The solutions of the functional equation (1.8) on groups are obtained in [9]. More

precisely, we have the following theorem.

Theorem 3.1. Let G be a group, let σ : G −→ G a homomorphism such that
σ ◦ σ = I, where I denotes the identity map, and µ : G −→ C be a multiplicative
function such that µ(xσ(x)) = 1 for all x ∈ G. The solutions f, g of the functional
equation (1.8) are the following pairs of functions, where χ : G −→ C denotes a
multiplicative function and c, α ∈ C∗
(i) f = 0 and g arbitrary.
(ii) g = χ+µχ◦σ
and f = αg.
(iii) g = χ+µχ◦σ
and f = (c + α/2)χ − (c − α/2)χ ◦ σ with (µ − 1)χ = (µ − 1)χ ◦ σ.
(iv) g = χ and f = χ(a + α), where where χ = µ χ ◦ σ and a is an additive map
which satisﬁes a ◦ σ + a = 0.

2

2

We shall now extend this result to monoids.

Theorem 3.2. Let M be a monoid, let σ : M −→ M a homomorphism such that
σ ◦ σ = I, where I denotes the identity map, and µ : M −→ C be a multiplicative
function such that µ(xσ(x)) = 1 for all x ∈ M . The solutions f, g of the functional
equation (1.8) are the following pairs of functions, where χ : M −→ C denotes a
multiplicative function and c, α ∈ C∗
(i) f = 0 and g arbitrary.
(ii) g = χ+µχ◦σ
and f = αg.
(iii) g = χ+µχ◦σ
and f = (c + α/2)χ − (c − α/2)χ ◦ σ with (µ − 1)χ = (µ − 1)χ ◦ σ.
(iv) g = χ, fe(xy) = fe(x)χ(y)+ fe(y)χ(x) for all x, y ∈ S and with f = fe + f (e)χ.
Furthermore, if M is a monoid which is generated by its squares, then χ = µ χ ◦ σ,
there exists an additive function a : M \Iχ −→ C for which a ◦ σ + a = 0,

2

2

f (x) = (cid:26) χ(x)(a(x) + α) f or x ∈ M \ Iχ

f or x ∈ Iχ

0

Indeed, If M is a topological group, or M is a topological monoid generated by its
squares, f, g, µ ∈ C(M ), and σ : M −→ M is continuous, then χ ∈ C(M ). In the
group case a ∈ C(M ) and in the second case a ∈ C(M \Iχ).

Proof. Verifying that the stated pairs of functions constitute solutions consists of
simple computations. To see the converse, i.e., that any solution f, g of (1.8) is
contained in one of the cases below, we will use [8, Lemma 3.4] and [9, Theorem
3.1]. All, except the last paragraphs of part (iv) and the continuity statements,
is in Theorem 3.1 in [9]. Now, we assume that M is a monoid generated by its

6

B. BOUIKHALENE AND E. ELQORACHI

squares. We use the notation used in the proof of Theorem 3.1 in [9], in particular
for the last paragraphs of part (iv) we have

(3.1)

fe(xy) = fe(x)χ(y) + fe(y)χ(x)

for all x, y ∈ S and with f = fe + f (e)χ. So, from [9, Lemma 3.4] we get f (x) =
0 + f (e)χ(x) = 0 + f (e)0 = 0 if x ∈ Iχ and f (x) = χ(x)(a(x) + f (e)) if x ∈ S\Iχ
and where a is an additive function of S\Iχ.
Now, we will verify that χ = µ χ ◦ σ and a ◦ σ = −a. Since f, g are solution of
equation (1.8) we have

(3.2)

f (xy) + µ(y)f (σ(y)x) = 2f (x)χ(y)

for all x, y ∈ M. By using the new expression of f and the fact that Iχ is an ideal,
we get after an elementary computation that f (xy) = f (yx) for all x, y ∈ M . So,
equation (3.2) can be written as follows

(3.3)

f (xy) + µ(y)f (xσ(y)) = 2f (x)χ(y), x, y ∈ M.

By replacing y by σ(y) in (3.3) and multiplying the result obtained by µ(y) we get

(3.4)

f (xy) + µ(y)f (xσ(y)) = 2f (x)µ(y)χ(σ(y)), x, y ∈ M.

Finally, by comparing (3.3), (3.4) and using f 6= 0 we get χ(y) = µ(y)χ(σ(y)) for
all y ∈ M.
By Substituting the expression of f into (3.3) and using χ(y) = µ(y)χ(σ(y)) and
µ(yσ(y)) = 1 for all y ∈ M , we ﬁnd after reduction that χ(x)χ(y)[a(y)+a(σ(y))] = 0
for all x, y ∈ M \Iχ. Since χ 6= 0 we get a(y) + a(σ(y)) = 0 for all y ∈ M \Iχ.
For the topological statement we use [13, Theorem 3.18(d)]. This completes the
proof.
(cid:3)

4. Solutions of (1.9) on groups and monoids

In this section we solve the functional equation (1.9) on monoids. In the next
proposition we show that if (f, g, h) is a complex-valued solution of equation (1.9),
then h satisﬁes the µ-sine subtraction law.

Proposition 4.1. Let M be a monoid, let σ be a involutive automorphism on S,
let µ be a multiplicative function on M such that µ(xσ(x)) = 1 for all x ∈ M.
Suppose that f, g, h : M −→ C satisfy the functional equation (1.9). Suppose also
that g 6= 0 and h 6= 0. Then
i) h(σ(x)) = −µ(σ(x))h(x)) for all x ∈ M .
ii) h(xy) = h(yx) for all x, y ∈ M .
3i) h satisﬁes the µ-sine subtraction law (2.1).
4i) If g(e) = 0, then g = bh for some b ∈ C \ {0}.
5i) If g(e) 6= 0, then h satisﬁes the µ-sine subtraction law with companion function
g
g(e) .
Moreover, if M is a topological monoid, and h 6= 0 is continuous, then the compan-
ion function is also continuous.

Proof. We follow the path of the proof of Proposition 3.1 in [8].
By substituent (x, yz), (σ(y), σ(z)x) and (z, σ(xy)) and (z, σ(xy)) in (1.9) we obtain

(4.1)

(4.2)

f (xyz) − µ(yz)f (σ(yz)x) = g(x)h(yz),

f (σ(yz)x) − µ(σ(z)x)f (zσ(xy)) = g(σ(y))h(σ(z)x),

FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS ON MONOIDS

7

(4.3)

f (zσ(xy)) − µ(σ(xy))f (xyz) = g(z)h(σ(xy)).

By multiplying (4.1) by µ(σ(xy)) we obtain that

(4.4)

µ(σ(xy))f (xyz) − µ(σ(x)z)f (σ(yz)x) = µ(σ(xy))g(x)h(yz).

By adding (4.3) and (4.4) we obtain

(4.5)

f (zσ(xy)) − µ(σ(x)z)f (σ(yz)x) = g(z)h(σ(xy)) + µ(σ(xy))g(x)h(yz).

By multiplying (4.5) by µ(σ(z)x) we obtain
(4.6)

µ(σ(z)x)f (zσ(xy)) − f (σ(yz)x) = µ(σ(z)x)g(z)h(σ(xy)) + µ(σ(zy))g(x)h(yz).

By adding (4.6) and (4.2) we obtain

(4.7)

0 = g(σ(y))h(σ(z)x) + µ(σ(z)x)g(z)h(σ(xy)) + µ(σ(zy))g(x)h(yz).

Setting x0 such that g(x0) 6= 0 and the fact that µ(xσ(x)) = µ(x)µ(σ(x)) = 1 for
all x ∈ M , we get that

(4.8)

h(yz) = µ(y)g(σ(y))l(z) + g(z)l1(y), y, z ∈ M

where l, l1 are complex valued functions on M . Using (4.8) in (4.7) we obtain for
all x, y, z ∈ M
(4.9)
g(x)g(σ(y)){l1(σ(z)) + µ(σ(z))l(z)} + g(x)g(z){µ(σ(z))l(σ(y)) + µ(σ(zy))l1(y)}+

g(z)g(σ(y)){µ(σ(z))l(x) + µ(σ(z)x)l1(σ(x))} = 0.

Putting x = x0, y = σ(x0), the equation (4.9) becomes

(4.10)

l1(σ(z)) + µ(σ(z))l(z) = cµ(σ(z))g(z), z ∈ M,

where c ∈ C is a constant. By putting (4.10) in (4.9) we obtain 3µ(σ(z))cg(x)g(σ(y))g(z) =
0 for all x, y, z ∈ S. Since g 6= 0 and µ(σ(z)) 6= 0 it follows that c = 0 and then
l1(σ(z)) = −µ(σ(z))l(z) for all z ∈ S. So that equation (4.8) becomes

(4.11)

h(yz) = µ(y)g(σ(y))l(z) − µ(y)g(z)l(σ(y)), x, y, z ∈ S

Replacing (y, z) by (σ(z), σ(y)) in (4.11) we obtain
(4.12)

h(σ(zy)) = µ(σ(zy))(µ(y)g(z)l(σ(y)) − µ(y)g(σ(y))l(z)) = −µ(σ(zy))h(yz).

From which we obtain by putting y = e that

(4.13)

h(σ(z)) = −µ(σ(z))h(z), z ∈ M.

From (4.12) and (4.13) we get that h a central function i.e. h(yz) = h(zy) for all
y, z ∈ M .
Next we consider two cases :
First case : Suppose g(e) = 0. Let z = e and x = x0 in (4.7) give that

(4.14)

h(y) = −cµ(y)g(σ(y)), y ∈ M

for some c ∈ C \ {0}. By replacing y by σ(y) in (4.14) we obtain that h(σ(y)) =
c h = bh where b = 1
−cµ(σ(y))g(y) for all y ∈ M . By using (4.14) we get that g = 1
and that

c

(4.15)

g(σ(z)) = −µ(σ(z))g(z), z ∈ S.

8

B. BOUIKHALENE AND E. ELQORACHI

Using (4.15) in (4.11) and setting m = −bl we get

h(yz) = µ(y)g(σ(y))l(z) − µ(y)g(z)l(σ(y))

= −µ(y)µ(σ(y))g(y)l(z) − µ(y)g(z)l(σ(y))
= −g(y)l(z) − µ(y)g(z)l(σ(y))
= −bh(y)l(z) − µ(y)bh(z)l(σ(y))
= h(y)m(z) + µ(y)h(z)m(σ(y)).

By replacing z by σ(z) we obtain

(4.16)

h(yσ(z)) = h(y)(m ◦ σ)(z) + µ(y)h(σ(z))m(σ(y)), y, z ∈ M.

By multiplying (4.16) by µ(z) and by setting n(z) = (m ◦ σ)(z)µ(z) we obtain the
µ-sine subtraction law with the companion function n

(4.17)

µ(z)h(yσ(z)) = h(y)n(z) − h(z)n(y).

This ends the ﬁrst case.
Second case : Suppose g(e) 6= 0. Then we obtain from (4.7) with x = e that

(4.18)

h(yz) = [µ(y)g(σ(y))h(z) + g(z)h(y)]/g(e).

Interchanging y and z in (4.18) we get

(4.19)

h(zy) = [µ(z)g(σ(z))h(y) + g(y)h(z)]/g(e).

By replacing z by σ(z) (4.19) and multiplying (4.19) by µ(z) we get

(4.20)

µ(z)h(σ(z)y) = h(y)

In the next two theorems we obtain the solutions of equation (1.9) by using our

results for the µ-sine subtraction law. We will follow the method used in [8].
Let Nµ(σ, S) be the nullspace given by

Nµ(σ, S) = {θ : S −→ C : θ(xy) − µ(y)θ(σ(y)x) = 0, x, y ∈ G}.

In the next theorem we consider the group case

Theorem 4.2. Let G be a group, let σ be a involutive automorphism on G, let
µ : G −→ C be a multiplicative function such that µ(xσ(x)) = 1 for all x ∈ G.
Suppose that f, g, h : G −→ C satisfy functional equation (1.9). Suppose also that
g 6= 0 and h 6= 0. Then there exists a character χ of G, constants c, c1, c2 ∈ C,
and a function θ ∈ Nµ(σ, S) such that one of the following holds

where A : G −→ C \ {0} is an additive function such that A ◦ σ = −A 6= 0.
Conversely, the formulas of (i) and (ii) deﬁne solutions of (1.9).
Moreover, if G is a topological group, and and f, g, h ∈ C(G), then χ, µ χ ◦ σ, A, θ ∈
C(G), while A ∈ C(G).

The proof of the theorem 4.2 will be integrated into that of theorem 4.3 in which

we consider the monoid case

Theorem 4.3. Let M be a monoid which is generated by its squares, let σ be
an involutive automorphism on M , let µ : M −→ C be a multiplicative function
such that µ(xσ(x)) = 1 for all x ∈ M. Suppose that f, g, h : M −→ C satisfy
functional equation (1.9). Suppose also that g 6= 0 and h 6= 0. Then there exists a
multiplicative function χ : M −→ C χ 6= 0, constants c, c1, c2 ∈ C, and a function
θ ∈ Nµ(σ, S) such that one of the following holds

Furthermore, if M is a topological monoid and k ∈ C(M ), then l, χ, µχ ◦ σ,
A ∈ C(M ). Conversely, the formulas of (i) and (ii) deﬁne solutions of (1.9).
Moreover, if M is a topological monoid, and f, g, h ∈ C(M ), then χ, µ χ ◦ σ, A, θ ∈
C(M ), while A ∈ C(M \ Iχ).

Proof. According to Proposition 4.1 we have two following cases:
First case : Suppose that g(e) = 0, then h satisﬁes the µ-sine subtraction law and
g = bh where b ∈ C \ {0}. According to Theorem 2.1 and Proposition 2.2 we get
(for M is a group or a monoid) that if χ 6= µχ ◦ σ, then h = c1
where
c1 ∈ C. Since g = bh, then g = c2
where c2 ∈ C. Subsisting g and h in

5. Applications: Solutions of equation (1.11) on groups and monoids

In this section, we use the results obtained in the previous paragraph to solve
the functional equation (1.11) on groups and monoids. We proceed as follows to
reduce the equation to the functional equation (1.8) and (1.9) so that we can apply
Theorem 3.1, Theorem 3.2, Theorem 4.2. and Theorem 4.3.

Theorem 5.1. Let G be a group, and σ an homomorphism involutive of G. Let
µ : G −→ C be a multiplicative function such that µ(xσ(x)) = 1 for all x ∈ G.
Suppose that the functions f, g, h : G −→ C satisfy the functional equation (1.11).
Suppose also that f +g 6= 0. Then there exists a character χ of G, constants α ∈ C∗,
c1, c2 ∈ C, and a function θ ∈ Nµ(σ, S) such that one of the following holds

Proof. Let f, g, h : G −→ C satisfy the functional equation (1.11). The case g = −f
was treated in Theorem 3.1 and Theorem 3.2. From now, on we assume that
f + g 6= 0. Let ho := h−µh◦σ
denote the odd, respectively
even, part of h with respect to µ and σ.
Setting x = e in (1.11) gives us

respectively he := h+µh◦σ

(5.1)

f (y) + µ(y)g(σ(y)) = h(e)h(y)

for all y ∈ G. Taking y = e in (1.11) and using µ(e) = 1 we ﬁnd

(5.2)

f (x) + g(x) = h(e)h(x)

for all x ∈ G. So, by comparing (5.1) with (5.2) we get

(5.3)

g(x) = µ(x)g(σ(x)), x ∈ G.

We note that (f + g)(xy) + µ(y)(f + g)(σ(y)x) = f (xy) + µ(y)g(σ(y)x) + g(xy) +
µ(y)f (σ(y)x) = h(x)h(y) + g(xy) + µ(y)f (σ(y)x). By using (5.3) we have g(xy) =

FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS ON MONOIDS

µ(xy)g(σ(x)σ(y)), then we get g(xy)+µ(y)f (σ(y)x) = µ(y)f (σ(y)x)+µ(xy)g(σ(x)σ(y)) =
µ(y)[f (σ(y)x) + µ(x)g(σ(x)σ(y))] = µ(y)h(x)h(σ(y)). Which implies that

(5.4)

(f + g)(xy) + µ(y)(f + g)(σ(y)x) = 2h(x)he(y)

for all x, y ∈ G. From (5.2) and the assumption that f + g 6= 0 we get h(e) 6= 0. So,
equation (5.4) can be written as follows

(5.5)

(f + g)(xy) + µ(y)(f + g)(σ(y)x) = 2(f + g)(x)

he(y)
h(e)

for all x, y ∈ G.
On the other hand by using similar computation used above, we obtain

(5.6)

(f − g)(xy) − µ(y)(f − g)(σ(y)x) = 2h(x)ho(y) = (f + g)(x)

for all x, y ∈ G. We can now apply Theorem 3.1, Theorem 3.2, Theorem 4.2 and
Theorem 4.3.
If ho = 0, then f − g ∈ N (σ, G), so there exists θ ∈ Nµ(σ, G) such that f − g = θ.
Since f, g satisfy (5.5) then from Theorem 3.1 we get the only possibility f + g =
α2 χ+µ χ◦σ
for some character χ : G −→ C and a constant α ∈ C
and we deduce that f = 1
)]. We deal
with case (i).
So during the rest of the proof we will assume that ho 6= 0. the function f + g, ho
are solution of equation (5.6) with f + g 6= 0 and ho 6= 0, so we know from Theorem
4.2 that there are only the following 2 possibilities:
(i) f − g = θ + c1
for some
character χ on G such that χ 6= µ χ◦σ, θ ∈ Nµ(σ, G) and constants c, c1, c2 ∈ C. So,
we have g = 1

We deal with case (a).
(ii) f − g = θ + χA( c

that χ = µ χ◦σ, A is an additive map on G such that A◦σ = −A, θ ∈ Nµ(σ, G) and
c, c2 ∈ C. So, we get g = χ(c+c2A)−θ−χA( c
. Since g = µg ◦ σ so, we have c =
