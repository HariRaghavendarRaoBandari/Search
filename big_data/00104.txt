Abstract—This paper proposes a dynamic Stackelberg repeated
game for decentralized Device-to-Device (D2D) communications
overlaying cellular communications. The proposed game aims
to jointly optimize D2D user behavior via a user-in-the-loop
(UIL) approach; and minimize transmit power, while maximizing
packet delivery ratio (PDR) for all D2D users. The Stackelberg
game architecture consists of a single leader (base station - BS)
and multiple followers (D2D users), where the leader selects
its satisfaction with the social welfare of the D2D users by
considering the reaction of the followers from the charged price
it assigns. The followers on the other hand select transmit power
so as to guarantee a certain level of quality-of-experience (QoE)
for all players. We express D2D user behavior as: (i) low data
requirement; (ii) medium data requirement; and (iii) high data
requirement. Therefore, each type of data requirement is assigned
different utility functions due to the performance demands of
D2D users. Both the leader and followers aim to maximize their
utility function within the Stackelberg game. We prove that there
exists an overall Stackelberg Equilibrium for our proposed game
for all players, which is a sub-game perfect equilibrium, as
the equilibrium achieved at each stage is independent of the
game history. Our simulation results illustrate that once the
leader rapidly converges to an optimal outcome with respect
to satisfaction, the followers then rapidly converge to a Pareto-
efﬁcient outcome with respect to transmit power and PDR.

INTRODUCTION

Device-to-Device (D2D) communications have been intro-
duced to cellular communications to help take the load off
the cellular network, by reducing the demand on the central
network operator, i.e., the base station (BS) [1]–[5]. Opti-
mization of D2D communications is important for optimal
mode selection, resource utilization, interference management,
power control, and spectral efﬁciency. Recently D2D user
behavior has been considered for ﬁfth generation (5G) cellular
networks, using the user-in-the-loop (UIL) approach. UIL is
a closed loop system with feedback, which allows D2D users
to choose what their requirements are and whether they will
allow their behavior to be controlled/inﬂuenced [6]–[10], i.e.,
smart communications.

Communications and the Australian Research Council through the ICT Centre
of Excellence Program.

Game theory is a decision making process, and allows
rational players (e.g., cellular and D2D users) to select their
action from an action set [11]. During the game, each player
aims to maximize their utility with respect to their action, to
ﬁnd an optimal solution and/or equilibrium in the game [11],
[12]. Here we will focus on a non-cooperative game, with no
communication between players. There are several types of
games which can be used to optimize D2D communications,
such as non-cooperative power control games, Stackelberg
games, and auction-based games [11].

In this paper, we propose a dynamic Stackelberg game
for resource allocation in distributed D2D communications,
with D2D overlay to cellular users. The BS is the Stack-
elberg leader, where it determines a price to charge the
followers, such that it can optimally select its satisfaction of
the communication cell. The D2D users are the competing
Stackelberg followers accessing the same spectrum, who try
to optimally select transmit power while guaranteeing quality-
of-service (QoS) and quality-of-experience (QoE), with respect
to the satisfaction price set by the BS. Hence, the following
contributions are made:

1) Our dynamic Stackelberg repeated non-cooperative
game jointly optimizes user behavior at the application
layer and transmit power at the physical (PHY) layer,
to increase overall system capacity, QoS, and QoE for
each D2D user, as well as guaranteeing social welfare
across all D2D users.

2) We investigate D2D user behavior with respect to three
types of data requirements: (i) low; (ii) medium; (iii)
high. Each behavior group is assigned a different utility
function which suits the particular behavior and its
properties.

3) The performance metric packet delivery ratio (PDR) is
used to measure communication priority and reliability
for each D2D user. We show the effects of PDR on
our proposed game by setting different minimum PDR
targets for each level of data requirements, e.g., low
data requirement has a minimum target PDR of 0.90,
medium data requirement has a minimum target PDR of
0.94, and high data requirement has a minimum target
PDR of 0.98.

4) We show that our proposed game overall has a unique
Stackelberg Equilibrium, and it is a sub-game perfect
equilibrium at each stage in the game which is in-
dependent of the game history. The leader, i.e., the
BS, and followers, i.e., the D2D users, converge to
optimal outcomes. The leader’s satisfaction ﬁrst rapidly
converges to an optimal outcome, then the followers

UNDER REVIEW FOR IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY

rapidly converge to a Pareto-efﬁcient transmit power
and PDR outcome. The optimal outcome for the leader
in terms of satisfaction helps guarantee social welfare
across all D2D users.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section II,
we investigate related work to our proposed game. Section
III outlines the system model of our proposed game. In
Section IV we deﬁne our dynamic Stackelberg repeated game,
describe the leader’s utility function plus the three types of
utility functions for the followers, and investigate the cost
function assigned to the followers utility function. We prove
that there exists a unique Nash Equilibrium for the leader
and followers, resulting in a Stackelberg Equilibrium for our
proposed game. Simulation results for our proposed game are
outlined in Section V, where we compare our game results to
three different non-cooperative power control games. Finally,
concluding remarks are made in Section VI.

II. RELATED WORK

D2D communications can be implemented in licensed or
unlicensed spectrum. We study D2D communications in li-
censed spectrum (in-band), i.e. the cellular spectrum [1], [5],
[13], [14]. Depending on how D2D and cellular users share
the spectrum, D2D communications could introduce two-types
of interference within the network; inter-cell interference and
intra-cell interference. Inter-cell interference is the interference
generated between D2D and cellular users from other cells [1],
[11], [13], [15], where intra-cell interference is the interference
generated between cellular and D2D users within each cell
[1], [11], [13], [15]. Non-cooperative power control games
and other power control methods have been implemented in
D2D communications to help minimize transmit power and
mitigate interference, while guaranteeing QoS for all users, as
in [11], [16]–[18]. Stackelberg games have been implemented
for resource utilization, such as power control, interference
management, mode selection, and scheduling, as in [11], [19]–
[23].

Ofﬂoading trafﬁc from the BS provides the following advan-
tages to the network: (i) the BS can accommodate more users
within the cell and increase system capacity and throughput
[5], [11], [24], [25]; (ii) increasing spectral efﬁciency of the
network [5], [11], [24], [25]; (iii) reduced latency for both
cellular and D2D users [5]; (iv) reducing the required power
consumption of the BS, cellular users, and D2D users [11],
[16]–[18], [24]. As a result, the BS will have more resources
to allocate to determining the cell layout, user locations within
the cell, priority, and type of communications.

The BS can also measure each D2D user’s satisfaction
within the cell [24], [26], in order to satisfy cell requirements.
Satisfaction of a D2D user can be measured by guaranteeing
either QoS [27], or QoE [6]. In [24], a user satisfaction based
resource allocation algorithm for D2D communications was
established, using an artiﬁcial ﬁsh swarm approach. From
[24] the proposed approach provides improved average system
satisfaction and increased system throughput, as the number
of D2D pairs is increased. The BS can determine the social
welfare of the cell by summing all the D2D users satisfaction

[25], [28], where social welfare is a socially optimal outcome
for particular network users-of-interest [29], [30].

User-in-the-loop (UIL) is an approach which can be used
to enable, and measure, D2D user satisfaction. UIL aims to
aid user’s experience by reducing trafﬁc and delay within
the network. Within UIL users can choose what their behav-
ior/requirements are, and depending on their chosen behavior
incentives or penalties may be charged to users, while ensuring
users maintain a certain level of QoE [8], [9]. Depending on
the D2D user’s chosen behavior, the incentives provided to
the user may consist of postponing their non-urgent message to
another time when there is less trafﬁc, or moving to a different
location where there is less trafﬁc [7], [8]. On the other hand,
the penalties provided to the user may consist of charging the
user a cost, if they did not wish to postpone their message
or move to a different location [7], [8]. Considering user be-
havior within the network, overall network spectral efﬁciency
can be increased, along with QoE for each D2D user [6].
Jointly optimizing user behavior and resource utilization is an
important research problem that needs to be addressed for D2D
communications, as outlined in [31]. Such joint optimization,
as will be outlined in this paper, can lead to signiﬁcantly
improved user experience and require less user input, while
optimizing communication parameters that increase network
efﬁciency.

III. SYSTEM MODEL

We implement our proposed game in a single cell for a
future ﬁfth generation (5G) cellular network, where D2D com-
munications overlay the cellular network. Future 5G cellular
networks will supersede Long Term Evolution - Advanced
(LTE-A) cellular networks where some forms of D2D com-
munications can already be deployed. Within the cell there
exists one base station (BS), one channel, one cellular user,
and N D2D users, {d1,d2,. . . ,dN}, as illustrated in Fig. 1.
This simpliﬁed scenario can be applied to a more general case
with many cellular and D2D users. For two D2D users to

communicate to one another, both users must be within the
maximum transmission range, creating a D2D (transmitter-
receiver) pair. Within the cell
2 D2D pairs.
As D2D communications is implemented as an overlay to
cellular communications, cellular and D2D users transmit in
orthogonal spectrum, hence eliminating interference between
the particular cellular user and D2D users, as D2D users
operate on dedicated spectrum [11], [13]–[15]. (Importantly,
the D2D users can still cause signiﬁcant radio interference
to each other, i.e. non-paired D2D transmitters act as hidden
terminals to D2D pairs within the cell). Additionally, here we
consider a single cell scenario, so inter-cell interference is not
considered.

The cell has been allocated one channel, which is divided
into K orthogonal subchannels as in [13], [14] [18], [20],
[23], where the BS allocates part of the uplink spectrum
from cellular users to D2D users, and the left-over spectrum
can be utilized by the cellular user. The D2D users will
compete against one another for the spectrum without causing
interference to the cellular user due to the overlay scenario.
Due to the spectrum allocation by the BS, both users within a
D2D pair cannot transmit at the same time, as this would result
in large self-interference [32]. To determine which D2D user
transmits within the D2D pair, we have assigned D2D users
with an odd index to transmit in odd time slots, and D2D users
with an even index to transmit in even time slots.

Depending on spectrum allocation by the BS, interference
between D2D pairs may be large. The interference received at
a D2D receiver, is the sum of the non-paired D2D transmitters
sharing the same subchannel. To guarantee QoS to D2D and
cellular users, we place a threshold on Signal-to-Interference-
plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), to help ensure signal quality. The
SINR at the receiver for the i-th D2D pair using part of the
k-th subchannel at time slot t is given by,

are, 13.75 dB for QPSK, 15.75 dB for 16-QAM, and 17 dB
for 64-QAM. Fig. 2 compares simulated PDR results to an

the constants ac and bc by taking the minimum error margin
between the simulated PDR and approximated PDR. We see
that this approximation result is very close to the simulation.

IV. DYNAMIC STACKELBERG USER-IN-THE-LOOP GAME

We propose a dynamic Stackelberg user-in-the-loop (S-
UIL) repeated game, which is ﬁnitely repeated for T times,
0 ≤ t ≤ T , where T < ∞. The S-UIL game consists of a
single leader and multiple followers. Where the leader of the
game is the BS and the D2D users are the followers, as outlined
in Fig. 3. The BS aims to gain optimal satisfaction within the
cell, with respect to the D2D users. Initially, the BS has little
satisfaction and knowledge about the cell and the D2D users.
Thus, the BS assigns a satisfaction price to the D2D users to
gain more information. The satisfaction price assigned to the
D2D users, must be reasonable, such that appropriate levels of
interference and transmit power are maintained by D2D users.
D2D users on the other hand behave selﬁshly with respect to
each other and the BS. The followers of the proposed game
have imperfect information, which means that all followers
select their action simultaneously. The followers individual
strategy is to minimize their transmit power within the transmit
power range, pmin ≤ pi ≤ pmax. When a follower selects it’s
action, there are two factors which must be considered: the
satisfaction price set by the BS; and the aim to maximize their
own utility function. Our proposed game is a sequential game,
which is evident in Fig. 3, thus the leader ﬁrst solves its utility
function and assigns a price to the followers, the followers
then solve their utility functions and share their measured
performance to the BS, such that it can update its satisfaction,
for the next iteration in the game.

D2D users must also guarantee QoE by providing users with
three types of behavior to choose from, which are outlined as
follows,

(i)
(ii)
(iii)

Low Data Requirement;
Medium Data Requirement;
High Data Requirement.

These three levels of behavior are quite broad and thus
address all types of practical applications for D2D users, which
include: local voice calls; SMS (Short Message Service); local

security and safety; MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service);
video calls; video sharing; gaming; uploading and download-
ing. Each kind of data requirement has its own utility function,
due to the different demands/conditions required for each
behavior with respect to transmit power and PDR. Initially,
D2D users sort themselves into one of the behavior groups
(as in Fig. 3), according to the type of data requirement and
practical applications the user requires. Once D2D users have
assigned themselves to a behavior group, they cannot change
behaviors during the ﬁnite stages of the repeated game, as
their actions are deterministic and thus the D2D users have
pure strategies. For a fair comparison between the different
behaviors, we ensure that there is an even number of D2D
transmitters (from the D2D pairs) in each of the behavior
groups. Since we consider only one of the D2D users within
the pair transmitting, hence the receiver from the D2D pair
can either lie within the same behavior group or another.

A. Leader Utility Function Analysis

The leader aims to obtain optimal satisfaction within the
cell with respect to the D2D users, by maximizing its utility
function with respect to satisfaction. The action set of the
leader is a ﬁnite set, where it measures its satisfaction as a
percentage, i.e. x ∈ (0, 1]. Satisfaction of 0% means that the
BS has no satisfaction within the cell, and satisfaction of 100%
means that the BS has total satisfaction within the cell. We
have disregarded the case where the BS has no satisfaction,
i.e. 0%, as in a real world scenario the BS would have some
general information about the cell.

The utility function for the leader of the dynamic Stack-
elberg UIL repeated game is an arbitrary quadratic function,
chosen for its particular and simple properties. The leader’s
utility function is a function of satisfaction (x) and average
measured performance of the followers (i.e. average transmit
power, ¯p), UBS(x, ¯p). The leader reacts to the average mea-
sured performance of the followers by updating its satisfaction
with the cell accordingly. The utility function for the leader
(BS) is as follows,

UBS(x, ¯p) = −αx2 + βx + κ,

the proposed game, t ∈ [0, T ]; κc is a positive scalar, κc > 0;
x is the satisfaction of the leader. At the end of each iteration
in the proposed game the leader maximizes its utility function
(7), with respect to the leader’s satisfaction, to ﬁnd the best
satisfaction for the BS, as given by,

B. Followers Utility Function Analysis

The followers play a non-cooperative power control game
taking into account the leader’s satisfaction price. The fol-
lowers aim to minimize their transmit power while reducing
interference, resulting in a power efﬁcient network. The action
set implemented for the followers is a ﬁnite set and is bounded
by a minimum transmit power and maximum transmit power,
pmin ≤ pi ≤ pmax. The followers further consider QoE
and initially select a behavior which best suits their data
requirements and practical applications. The three types of data
requirements considered in our proposed game, are assigned
different utility functions. Sections IV-B1, IV-B2, and IV-B3,
introduce the three types of data requirements, by explaining
their practical applications and corresponding utility functions.
1) Low Data Requirement Utility Function: D2D users who
select low data requirement as their behavior, may perform one
of the following practical applications: local voice call1; SMS;
local security and safety communications2 [5], [31]. The utility
function for D2D users with low data requirement behavior,
has been taken from [36], UF L,i(x, pi). This utility function
is an SINR-balancing function and is modiﬁed to include the
cost function charged to the followers. This type of utility
function was selected for this behavior as it gives improved
emphasis on transmit power and less emphasis on PDR,
while still maintaining minimum target PDR. The practical
application for this behavior requires low transmit power and
quality compared to the other two types of behaviors, as the
information being transmitted is much simpler. Hence, the
utility function for low data requirement is deﬁned as follows,

UF L,i(x, pi) =

at time t; C(x, pi) is the cost function which is analyzed in
Section IV-C. At the end of each iteration in the proposed
game, the follower’s utility function (8) is maximized, to ﬁnd
optimal transmit power and PDR for all users with this type
of behavior,

2) Medium Data Requirement Utility Function: D2D users
whose behavior type is medium data requirement, may be
performing one of the following practical applications: MMS;
video calling; video sharing; gaming [5], [31]. The utility func-
tion for medium data requirement is taken from [36], where the

networks, voice calls will be sent via packets instead of bits, and possibly
referred to as VoLTE (Voice-over-LTE) [35].

where local coordination and communication between neighboring police
ofﬁcers, ﬁreman, and ambulance ofﬁcers would be necessary.

utility function was originally a cost function. By taking the
negative of the cost function from [36], we transform it into a
utility function, UF M,i(x, pi), and include the cost function
charged to the followers. We have assigned the following
utility function to this behavior, as it gives approximately
equal emphasis to transmit power and PDR. The practical
application for this behavior requires complex communication,
which means a slightly higher demand for transmit power, as
opposed to the low data requirement behavior, to ensure good
signal quality at the receiver without larger latency periods.
The utility function for medium data requirement for any
player, is given by,

function (9) is maximized, to ﬁnd optimal transmit power and
PDR for all users with medium data requirement behavior,

3) High Data Requirement Utility Function: High data
requirement behavior for D2D users, may be performing one of
the following practical applications: uploading; downloading
[5], [31]. The utility function for high data requirement is taken
from [29], where the utility function is a function of transmit
power and PDR, UF H,i(x, pi). We modify the utility function
from [29] to include cost function. This utility function has
been assigned to this behavior as it gives larger emphasis on
PDR and less emphasis on transmit power. Users implementing
this behavior would require signiﬁcantly higher transmit power
than the other two behaviors, due to, e.g., uploading and
downloading of large content, and general higher throughput
requirements. Due to the greater emphasis on higher PDR, this
means that signal quality is ensured, communication reliability
is guaranteed, and content is fully uploaded/downloaded in a
reasonable timeframe without any signiﬁcant latency concerns.
The utility function for the high data requirement behavior, is
given by,

C. Followers Cost Function

The three utility functions for the followers, (8), (9), (10),
are assigned a cost function. The aim of the cost function is
to charge the followers for using the dedicated spectrum. The
cost function we have created for the followers considers both
the leader’s satisfaction and the individual follower’s transmit
power. The cost function is given by,

(cid:19)(cid:18)

C(x, pi) =

ln(q − x)

1

ln(y − pi
z )

(11)

(cid:19)

.

Equation (11) logarithmically combines the leader’s satisfac-
tion x and the follower’s individual transmit power pi. As
a result,
the followers utility functions will decrease with
increasing cost.
Deﬁnition 1. The pair of strategies for the leader and follow-
ers A∗ = [x, pi] = [(x(cid:63), p(cid:63)
N/2)] for the
BS and every D2D pair i ∈ N
2 , is a Stackelberg Equilibrium
in the proposed repeated game, if the following is satisﬁed:
1) The leader ﬁrst achieves a unique Nash Equilibrium:

2), . . . , (x(cid:63), p(cid:63)

1), (x(cid:63), p(cid:63)

UBS([x(cid:63), ¯p]) ≥ UBS([x, ¯p])
for all x.

2) The followers then achieve a unique Nash Equilibrium

thereafter:

i ], [x(cid:63), p(cid:63)−i]) ≥ UF,i([x, pi], [x(cid:63), p(cid:63)−i])

UF,i([x(cid:63), p(cid:63)
for all pi ∈ p, for all x and for all i ∈ N

2

Remark 1. Once the leader achieves a unique Nash Equilib-
rium, the followers will then achieve a unique Nash Equilib-
rium thereafter, resulting in a Stackelberg Equilibrium.
Proposition 1. The Stackelberg Equilibrium,
the best
response for the leader and all the followers, exists over all
stages of the game. Furthermore it is sub-game perfect as it
is independent of the game history (previous stages).

i.e.,

From Deﬁnition 1 we prove that there exists a Stackelberg
Equilibrium for the proposed game, across all players, in the
following two proofs.

Proof: To prove that

the leader has a unique Nash
Equilibrium, we have to test if its utility function (7), is strictly
continuous and concave. To show strict continuity, this can be
∂x = 0,
done by solving the ﬁrst order derivative condition, ∂UBS

∂x

∂x

= −2αx + β,

= 0,

∴ x(cid:63) =

.

(12)

(13)

From (12) we can see that (7) is a continuous function within
(xmin, xmax]. We are also able to solve for a unique solution
for the leader’s satisfaction (13), which is always maximum.
We input x(cid:63) into the follower’s utility functions, which is a
unique solution for x. Next, to show that the utility function
(7) is strictly concave, we solve the second order derivative
condition, ∂2UBS

∂x2 < 0,

∂2UBS(·)
∂2UBS(·)

∂x2

∂x2

= −2α,

< 0.

(14)

Equation (14) proves that the leader’s utility function (7) is
strictly concave, due to α > 0.

Proof: More particularly we prove that the three utility
functions for the followers (8), (9), (10) have a unique Nash
Equilibrium. To determine if the functions are strictly con-
tinuous, we must solve the ﬁrst order derivative condition,

(17)

From (15), (16) and (17) we can see that
the follower’s
utility functions are continuous within the range [pmin, pmax].
If we substitute x(cid:63) for x from (13), each follower’s utility
function will have a unique solution for transmit power, p(cid:63)
i ,
which maximizes their utility function. We take an average
of all
the player’s unique solutions producing an average
unique solution, ¯p, which is in equilibrium and input to the
leader’s utility function (7). Therefore, the Nash Equilibrium
is a hierarchial equilibrium, as the leader ﬁrst achieves a
Nash Equilibrium and the followers achieve Nash Equilibrium
thereafter. Next, to show that the followers utility functions
are strictly concave, we solve the second order derivative

We can split (20) into three sections, the ﬁrst and third sections
will always be negative, if the constants satisfy the following
conditions; wi ≥ 1, ∆ > 0, q > 0, y > 0, and z > 0. We know
that x, pi, γi, and pdri are always positive, hence, in order
for the second part of (20) to satisfy the overall second order
derivative condition of concavity, the constants must satisfy
the following conditions; a < 0, b < 0, di > 0, and vi > 0. In
appendix A, we also prove that the follower’s utility functions
(8), (9), (10) are strictly concave and continuous with respect
to the leader’s satisfaction.
Remark 2. For the game to have a Pareto-efﬁcient outcome,
the leader must ﬁrst converge to an optimal outcome, then
the followers will converge to an Pareto-optimal outcome
thereafter.
Remark 3. When the leader has maximized satisfaction, which
includes knowledge of an efﬁcient outcome from the followers,
it is an optimal outcome for the leader that guarantees social
welfare across all the followers.
Proposition 2. The game is Pareto-efﬁcient as the leader’s
satisfaction is maximized and then all
followers transmit
powers are minimized, while achieving desired packet delivery
ratio (PDR), in our dynamic Stackelberg repeated game.

Proof: A Pareto-efﬁcient outcome is fully deﬁned over the
entire game, according to Algorithm 1. The leader ﬁrst obtains
an efﬁcient outcome with respect
then the
followers converge to a Pareto-efﬁcient outcome with respect
to transmit power and PDR, such that the game achieves an
overall Pareto-optimal outcome. When the BS’s satisfaction,
x, is maximized the desired outcome in terms of satisfaction
is achieved. Hence, each D2D transmitter, i, will minimize its
transmit power with respect to all other transmitters, −i, until

V. SIMULATION RESULTS

In this section, we outline the simulation results of our
proposed game from Algorithm 1. We compare the three levels
of data quality with respect to transmit power and PDR. We
also look at the effect of the leader’s satisfaction price and
the cost function, on D2D users. The results of our dynamic
Stackelberg user-in-the-loop game are compared to three non-

rate turbo code. In Fig. 4, we look at the leader’s satisfaction
within the cell, with respect to whether the D2D users consider

UIL) game maximizes the BS’s measured performance and
obtains optimum satisfaction. As the game evolves over the
number of stages in the game, so does the satisfaction of the
BS, which grows from 0.001 to 1 during 6 stages. The BS’s
satisfaction is evolving due to the average measured followers
performance fed back to the leader after each iteration of the
game. Fig. 4 shows that if the D2D users consider priority
for each level of behavior, there is no effect on the leader’s
satisfaction, if D2D users were not to consider priority. Fig. 4
also shows fast convergence to an optimal satisfaction for the
leader in our proposed game for both cases , i.e., 1.

Fig. 5a, plots the average transmit power for the three
types of behavior for all the followers in our dynamic S-
UIL repeated game, without priority. The distances between
D2D pairs are random and do not exceed the maximum D2D
transmission range. It
the proposed S-UIL
game reduces transmit power on average more than the non-
cooperative power control (NPC) games. Table III outlines
the average outcome of transmit power for the three levels
of D2D user behavior for both the NPC games and S-UIL
game. Also in Table III we include the average outcome of
transmit power before and after the BS converges to an optimal
outcome, for our proposed S-UIL game. As a result, once
the BS converges to an optimal satisfaction, as in Fig. 4,
the followers then further reduce their transmit power to a
Pareto-efﬁcient outcome, while maintaining their PDR, and
as a result guaranteeing social welfare across all D2D users.
Due to the D2D users in our S-UIL game reducing their
transmit power more than the NPC games, this means that the
interference generated by D2D users is reduced signiﬁcantly.
Another beneﬁt for reducing transmit power for D2D users
allows for an increase in battery lifetime, hence creating a
power efﬁcient network.

priority. Table IV outlines the average outcome of PDR for
the NPC games and our proposed game. In Fig. 5b, we
observe that our S-UIL game has different effects on PDR,
depending on user behavior. High data requirement from the
S-UIL game maximizes PDR more than the NPC games,
where medium data requirement has little change in PDR when
comparing the S-UIL game and the NPC game with medium
data requirement. Low data requirement on the other hand has
the lowest PDR out of all simulation results, however it is
still above minimum target PDR. The different PDR outcomes
for the three behaviors, illustrates the range of communication
reliability and quality (above a minimum PDR target). High
data requirement behavior maximizes PDR on average more
than all other results, hence by maximizing reliability this
allows uploading and downloading of content to be done in
an efﬁcient manner at high quality with little latency.

Fig. 5c and Fig. 5d plot average transmit power and PDR for
D2D users respectively, by taking into account different levels
of priority for each behavior, i.e. low data requirement has

a minimum target PDR of 0.9, medium data requirement has
a minimum target PDR of 0.94, and high data requirement
has a minimum target PDR of 0.98. Fig. 5c exhibits the
same characteristics as Fig. 5a, with a slight decrease in
average transmit power as the leader converges to an optimal
satisfaction. Fig. 5d on the other hand shows the effects of PDR
when different levels of priority is considered for each behavior
group. In Fig. 5d, the high data requirement for the S-UIL
game achieves its minimum target PDR of 0.98, except this is
not the case for the NPC game with high data requirement. For
all other behaviors, our proposed game and the NPC games
also achieve their minimum target PDRs. Hence, our dynamic
S-UIL repeated game achieves better communication reliability
for all levels of behavior than the NPC games.

As the leader becomes more satisﬁed within the game and
converges to its optimal satisfaction outcome, the D2D users
also further reduce their transmit power, as in both Fig. 5a and
Fig. 5c, while maintaining their PDR, as in Fig. 5b and Fig. 5d.
Therefore, once the leader converges to optimal satisfaction,

as in Fig. 4, the social welfare is guaranteed across all D2D
users.

VI. CONCLUSION

The number of users within cellular communications net-
works is ever increasing. Introducing D2D communications as
an overlay to cellular networks can help reduce the load on
the cellular network, while increasing network efﬁciency. In
this paper, we proposed a dynamic Stackelberg repeated game
with input from D2D users via a user-in-the-loop approach .
We designed a dynamic Stackelberg-UIL repeated game, which
jointly optimizes D2D user behavior and transmit power. The
BS was assigned as the leader of the dynamic Stackelberg
game whose strategy was to measure satisfaction with the D2D
users within the cell, and the D2D users are the followers
of the proposed game whose strategy is to minimize transmit
power. The utility function for the leader and followers all have
a unique Nash Equilibrium, and we proved that these utility
functions are also strictly concave and continuous. Hence, the
proposed game achieved a Stackelberg Equilibrium, which is
sub-game perfect due to being independent of the game history.
Simulation results have shown that as the BS converges to a
an optimal satisfaction, the followers then converge to Pareto-
efﬁcient transmit power and PDR. We compared our game to
three NPC games which reﬂect the three different behaviors.
Finally, we considered prioritized behavior, by setting different
minimum PDR targets to different behaviors. From simulation
results it
that our proposed game has a much
better outcome than traditional NPC games, as players transmit
power are further minimized, and PDR is also achieved and
maximized.

We prove that the follower’s utility functions (8), (9), (10)
are also strictly concave and continuous with respect to the
leader’s satisfaction. To show strict continuality, this is done by
solving the ﬁrst order derivative condition, ∂UF (cid:63)
∂x = 0, where
(cid:63) represents all three utility functions for the followers. The
cost charged to the followers is the same for all the follower
utility functions.
