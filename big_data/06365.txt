The electrical, in-plane resistance as a function of temperature R(T ) of bulk and mesoscopic thin
graphite ﬂakes obtained from the same batch was investigated. Samples thicker than ∼ 30 nm show
metalliclike contribution in a temperature range that increases with the sample thickness. Whereas
a semiconductinglike behavior was observed for thinner samples. The temperature dependence
of all samples can be very well explained assuming three contributions in parallel: a metalliclike
conducting path at the interfaces between crystalline regions, composed of two semiconducting
phases, i.e. Bernal and rhombohedral stacking. From the ﬁts of R(T ) we obtain a semiconducting
energy gap of 106 ± 10 meV for the rhombohedral and 38 ± 5 meV for the Bernal phase. The
presence of these crystalline phases was conﬁrmed by X-ray diﬀraction measurements.

Graphite, a layered material built by weakly coupled
graphene sheets, is a material being studied experimen-
tally and theoretically for more than ﬁfty years. Usu-
ally, the graphene layers adopt an hexagonal ABAB . . .
(2H) stacking sequence called the Bernal
[1] struc-
ture. However, another stable phase in graphite has an
ABCABC . . . stacking order called rhombohedral (3R)
graphite [2]. According to early literature [2, 3], high
quality graphite samples can be composed of up to ∼ 30%
rhombohedral and the rest Bernal phase. Recent stud-
ies on exfoliated few-layer graphene (FLG) using Raman
spectroscopy, show domains of diﬀerent stacking order
with ∼ 15 % of the total area displaying 3R stacking [4].
The domains exhibiting 3R stacking in FLG are stable
to 800 ◦C [4] and to 1000 ◦C in bulk graphite [5, 6].

Wallace calculated the band structure of graphite
within tight-binding approximation with the result that
graphite behaves like a semiconductor with a vanishing
small energy gap [7, 8]. The existence of a ﬁnite energy
gap in graphite was proposed by Mrozowsky based on
the analysis of electrical resistivity and diamagnetism of
polycrystalline graphite [9, 10]. Recent theoretical work
on 3R graphite suggests the formation of an energy gap
that should become smaller increasing the number of
graphene layers of the 3R phase [11–13]. By means of
angle-resolved photoemission [14] the existence of an en-
ergy gap of the order of 100 meV in trilayer 3R graphite
was obtained. The study of the electrical transport prop-
erties of bulk graphite dates back to Dutta for single crys-
tals [15] and to Reynolds for natural and polycrystalline
samples [16]. Since then, none of the large number of

published studies on the transport properties of graphite
considered the inﬂuence of the 3R phase, even though
there is no doubt about its existence in usual graphite
samples.

The presence of the 3R phase in graphite samples can
have a further, drastic inﬂuence on their transport prop-
erties. Recent theoretical work predicts a topological pro-
tected ﬂat band at the surface of 3R graphite [17], which
was recently conﬁrmed experimentally [18]. Moreover,
assuming a ﬁnite Cooper-pair coupling, this ﬂat band
might trigger high-temperature superconductivity [19–
21], which should exist also at the embedded interfaces
between Bernal and 3R crystalline phases [22, 23]. There-
fore, the presence of both stacking orders in a graphite
sample can have clear competitive contributions to the
conductivity of real samples.

In this work, the inﬂuence of 3R stacking on the
in-plane resistance of 11 samples, bulk and mesoscopic
graphite ﬂakes, was studied. The presence of both stack-
ing orders was conﬁrmed by X-rays diﬀraction (XRD).
Assuming the contributions of the two crystalline stack-
ing plus a metalliclike contribution from the interfaces in
parallel, we are able to ﬁt the temperature dependence
of the resistance of all samples in a broad temperature
range. From the ﬁts we obtain an energy gap for the
3R stacking regions in our samples in agreement with
results from literature [14]. We also conclude that the
metalliclike is due to interfaces between Bernal and 3R
stacking and/or to twisted single Bernal phases [24]. Fol-
lowing theoretical results, we note that these interfaces
might be the reason for the superconductinglike behavior

at very high temperatures observed in the magnetization
of bulk and treated graphite powders [25–27] as well as
in the transport properties of TEM graphite lamellae [28]
and stapled graphite ﬂakes [29].

The graphite samples used for experiments were ob-
tained from highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG)
bulk material from Advanced Ceramic with a rocking
curve width of 0.4o and metallic impurities in the ppm
range [30]. Investigated mesoscopic ﬂakes were produced
on top of silicon substrates caped with a 150 nm thick in-
sulating silicon nitride (Si3Nx). For this work, the ﬂakes
were produced by a rubbing method already described
in previous publications [31]. After selecting suitable
samples, electron beam lithography was used to print
the structures for the electrodes, which were sputtered
with a bilayer of Cr/Au with a thickness of ≈ 5 nm and
≈ 30 nm, respectively. The temperature dependent resis-
tance of the samples was measured in a commercial 4He
cryostat, within the temperature range of 2 K to 310 K.
Low noise resistance measurements were performed using
an AC Bridge (Linear Research LR-700), with a constant
current . 5 µA.

The structural quality of all samples was investigated
by Raman and XRD measurements. For this purpose, a
confocal micro-Raman microscope was used (alpha 300+,
WITec) with an incident laser light with λ = 532 nm

2

and a maximal power of 3 mW. The Raman results of
some selected samples are shown in Fig. 1(a). The most
intense peaks in the Raman spectra of graphene and
graphite are expected at ≃ 1580 cm−1 (the G-peak) and
at ≃ 2700 cm−1 (the G′ peak) [32]. The so-called D-
peak at ≃ 1350 cm−1 is related to the disorder present
in the material [33, 34]. The Raman results indicate, see
Fig. 1(a), that all samples have the same structural or-
der as the initial bulk material (sample GB1) without
evidence of disorder within experimental resolution. Due
to the relative small amount of the 3R phase in com-
parison with the Bernal one and the fact that this 3R
phase is in general embedded within the Bernal matrix,
our Raman measurements do not have enough resolution
to discriminate clearly the existence of the 3R phase, as
has been shown recently in few layers graphite using the
same technique [35].

The XRD measurements were done using a Bruker D8
Discover (Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA) with
a GADDS-detector system (V˚ANTEC-500). Note that
there are several peaks not suitable for distinguishing
both stacking modiﬁcations of graphite. Both the (00l)
and (hh0) of the 2H and 3R stacking are superposed.
Therefore, the 2Θ range 40 − 47◦ was selected to de-
termine and approximately quantify the rhombohedral
phase in the samples, see Fig. 1(b), because the reﬂexes
are not superposed in this particular range. Note, how-
ever, the reﬂexes intensities are . 1% of the maximum
relative intensity. The Rietveld reﬁnement using TOPAS
4.2 results in 86 ± 3 wt.% for the 2H and 14 ± 3 wt.% for
the 3R phase. We conclude that the presence of 3R stack-
ing in our samples is conﬁrmed. Scanning transmission
electron microscopy (STEM) measurements for similar
samples show that they are composed of many crystalline
regions with aligned c-axis but with diﬀerent a − b-axes
orientations, i.e. twisted Bernal crystalline regions [31].
As XRD results indicate, some of the crystalline regions
have 3R stacking. Between both regions, Bernal and 3R
as well as between twisted Bernal regions, interfaces are
formed. The crystalline regions have a lateral size of the
order of tenths of micrometer and a thickness varying
from a few nanometers to ∼ 400 nm [31]. We expect
that the thinnest crystalline regions in our samples have
the 3R phase.

The results of the temperature dependence of the nor-
malized resistance of all investigated samples are pre-
sented in Fig. 2. Although all samples were obtained
from the same initial material, diﬀerent temperature de-
pendence can be observed. Some samples show a metalli-
clike behavior in all temperature range, such as the GB1
(bulk), or for the multilayer graphene (MLG) ﬂakes GF2
and GF3. Some samples exhibit a combination of metal-
lic and semiconductinglike behavior (e.g. GF4 and GF5).
The samples GF9 and GF10 show only semiconducting-
like behavior with a saturation at low temperatures. The
overall results are in agreement with those published ear-
lier [31]. At ﬁrst, considering that the samples were pro-
duced using the same initial material and that the struc-

FIG. 2: Normalized resistance results of all investigated sam-
ples. The lines are ﬁts of the data to Eq. 5 with the parameters
of Table I (supplementary data). The inset shows the calcu-
lated resistivity as a function of the thickness. The dashed
line is a guide to the eye.

tural quality between samples does not appear to dif-
fer, the results shown in Fig. 2 are not obvious. Taking
into account, however, the internal structure of the ini-
tial bulk sample revealed by STEM [31], it is clear that
the signiﬁcant diﬀerence is given by the sample thickness.
A dependence of the calculated resistivity on the sample
thickness is shown in the inset of Fig. 2. The resistivity
increases with decreasing thickness, indicating that the
resistivity in relatively thick graphite samples is not con-
stant and that these samples should not be considered as
a homogeneous material.

The usual thickness dependence of the resistivity in
metalliclike systems, such as Cu [36] or Ag [37], can be
described using the theory of Fuchs-Sondheimer [38, 39],
which considers the inﬂuence of scattering processes at
the sample surface. However, this is hardly the case for
a material consisting of weakly coupled stacked layers
of 2D graphene sheets, where each single sheet is al-
ready conducting. The decrease of the resistivity with
increasing thickness was interpreted as a consequence of
the increasing metalliclike contribution of the interfaces
between crystalline regions [31, 40]. We note that the for-
mation of metalliclike regions at interfaces is not a new
concept and was already observed in many oxide ma-
terials where even superconductivity was found at very

3

low temperatures [41, 42]. Garc´ıa et al. [43] proposed a
simple model to understand the R(T ), which consists of
two main contributions in parallel, one is originated from
the interfaces (Ri(T )) and the other from the crystalline
regions (Rs(T )). The total resistance was formulated as:

R(T )−1 = R−1

i

(T ) + R−1

s (T ),

(1)

To obtain a good ﬁt at low temperatures, where the
metalliclike behavior overwhelms, it was necessary to as-
sume an interface contribution to the total resistance of
the form:

Ri(T ) = R0 + R1T + R2 exp(cid:18) −Ea

kBT (cid:19) ,

(2)

where the coeﬃcients R0, R1, R2 as well as the ac-
tivation energy Ea are free parameters. The temper-
ature independent term R0 represents the residual re-
sistance at low temperatures. The linear term contri-
bution (usually much weaker than the exponential one,
i.e. R1 ≪ R0,2) is expected to come from the lon-
gitudinal acoustic (LA) phonon scattering [45–47], for
example. This contribution was already observed in
graphene samples produced on SiO2 [48] and in sus-
pended graphene [49]. A similar, exponential third term
of Eq. (2) was already used to describe the tempera-
ture dependence of two dimensional electron-hole sys-
tems formed at the interfaces of non-conducting ma-
terials, e.g. GaAs/AlAs heterostructures [50] or p-type
SiGe [51]. This thermally activated contribution was
ﬁrst used by Kopelevich et al. [52] and later by Taku-
moto et al. [53] to ﬁt the metalliclike increase in the re-
sistance with temperature observed in bulk graphite sam-
ples. The origin of this contribution, however, remains
still controversial. For example, it could be explained
using a percolation of electron-hole liquid [54], disorder
and electron-electron interactions [55], or through the en-
hanced spin-orbit interaction by broken inversion symme-
try [56]. However, the probable origin of this thermally
activated term could be related to the superconductiv-
ity localized at the interfaces between Bernal and 3R
stacking. We note that a similar exponential dependence
has been observed in granular Al-Ge [57] for a particular
Al concentration. This thermally activated behavior can
be understood on the basis of the Langer-Ambegaokar-
McCumber-Halperin (LAMH) model [58, 59] that applies
to narrow superconducting channels in which thermal
ﬂuctuations can cause phase slips. The value of the acti-
vation energy Ea ∼ 4 meV obtained from the ﬁts remains
similar for all measured samples, see Table I (supplemen-
tary data).

The second term in Eq. (1) is related to the crystalline
parts, which we assume to behave as intrinsic semicon-
ductors, given by:

Rs(T ) = a(T ) · exp(cid:18) +Eg

FIG. 3: R(T ) of sample GF11. The ﬁts are shown as con-
tinuous lines. In (a) the data were ﬁtted using Eqs. (1,2,3)
with a(T )/R(350) =1.46, a semiconducting energy gap Eg =
26 meV, an activation energy Ea = 3.8 meV, and the param-
eters R0,1,2/R(350) = 0.53, 0.002, 0.57, respectively. (b) The
same data and a ﬁt to similar equations as in (a) but with
a(T ) = a0T 3/2. The parameters of the best ﬁt (red curve)
are: a0/R(350) = 1.7 × 10−4, Eg = 89 meV, Ea = 2.95 meV,
R0,1,2/R(350) = 0.53, 6.5 × 10−4, 0.54. The other curves are
obtained ﬁxing the Eg value 10% above and below the best
ﬁt value and leaving all other parameters free. In (c) and (d)
the data were ﬁtted using Eq. (5) (red curve) with the pa-
rameters given in Table I (supplementary data). The insets
in (a-c) expands the data and ﬁts at high temperatures. The
other ﬁt curves were obtained as in (b) changing the value
of Eg1 by ±10%. In (d) each in-parallel contribution to the
resistance is shown separately. A similar ﬁtting procedure is
obtained for all samples. See as further example the one for
sample GF3 [44].

where a(T ) is a mobility-dependent prefactor, Eg is the
semiconducting energy gap and kB is the Boltzmann con-
stant. The temperature dependent parameter a(T ) can
be written as:

a(T ) =

1

N (µh + µe)T 3/2

,

(4)

4

where N is a temperature independent constant and µe
and µh are the electron and hole mobilities. In the work
of Garc´ıa et al. [40], a(T ) was assumed to be constant,
which results of assuming µh,e ∝ T −3/2, and it is a good
approximation for typical semiconductors [60, 61].

As example, we show the ﬁtting procedure to Eq. (1)
for sample GF11, see Fig. 3(a). The parameters obtained
from the ﬁttings have a maximum standard deviation of
∼ 10% and low correlation eﬀects. Therefore, we re-
strict ourselves to show the best ﬁts obtained after a
careful test of the correlation eﬀects between the free pa-
rameters. The assumed metalliclike contribution given
by Eq. (2) ﬁts well at low temperatures. However, in
the inset we can clearly see that at higher temperatures,
the ﬁt considerably diﬀers from the experimental data.
We assume that this deviation at high temperatures is
partially a consequence of the approximation that a(T )
is constant. Therefore, we improve the model assum-
ing that µe,h ∝ T −3 following experimental studies in
graphite ﬂakes [62, 63]. Taking this into account, we ob-
tain a(T ) = a0 · T 3/2 and include it in Eq. (3). Using
this in Eq. (1) we can ﬁt the experimental data at high
temperatures better than before (see Fig. 3(b) and its
inset). In the inset we show the change of the best possi-
ble ﬁts changing manually 10% Eg and leaving all other
parameters free.

Similar or even worse results for the other investigated
samples are obtained assuming a single semiconducting
contribution. From our XRD data we know that graphite
is composed of two phases, Bernal and 3R stacking, and
therefore we now consider these two independent and in-
parallel contributions in our model to describe the tem-
perature dependence of the resistance. For this purpose,
Eq. (1) is modiﬁed by adding a new semiconducting con-
tribution in parallel:

Rt(T )−1 = R−1

i

(T ) + R−1

s1 (T ) + R−1

s2 (T ),

(5)

where Rs1 and Rs2 correspond to 3R and Bernal stack-
ing. Using this new assumption, we can very well ﬁt the
experimental data over all temperature range for all sam-
ples, see Fig. 3(c) and Fig. 2. The contributions of each
component of Eq. (5) are plotted in Fig. 3(d) as lines to-
gether with the data of sample GF11. Further example
of these ﬁts can be seen for sample GF3 in [44].

Both, bulk and thin MLG samples, can be very well
ﬁtted to Eq. (5) with the parameters listed in Table I
[44]. The values obtained for the activation energy are in
agreement with those from the literature [43, 52, 53] and
are, compared to 2DEG systems, one order of magnitude
larger.
In the work of Garc´ıa et al. [43] the samples
were investigated to T ≈ 275 K and the obtained semi-
conducting energy gap ∼ 40 meV was attributed to the
main phase of the sample, the Bernal stacking. Simi-
lar small band gaps have been observed in rhombohedral
Bi [64] and Bi0.88Sb0.12 alloy [65]. The values of Eg1 ob-
tained from the ﬁts to R(T ) for all samples are in good
agreement with that of ARPES [14]. Therefore, the en-
ergy gaps obtained from the ﬁtting process can be related

to the two semiconducting phases.

Concluding, we have investigated the longitudinal re-
sistance of a bulk and a series of mesoscopic graphite sam-
ples obtained from the same initial material with similar
structural quality. Our results show that the transport
properties of bulk graphite are not unique, as they de-
pend strongly upon the amount of interfaces present in
the material. By ﬁtting the temperature dependence of
the resistance R(T ), we found indications for the contri-
bution of the semiconducting rhombohedral phase with

an energy gap similar to the one reported in literature.
XRD measurements reveal the presence of the rhombo-
hedral and Bernal phases in the graphite material used
in our experiments. The interfaces between these two
stacking orders may be the ones that provide the high-
temperature superconducting properties measured in dif-
ferent graphite samples in the last years.

FIG. 4: R(T ) of sample GF3. The ﬁts are shown as continuous lines.
In (a) the data were ﬁtted using Eqs. (1,2,3) with
a(T )/R(310) = 1.38, a semiconducting energy gap Eg = 29.5 meV and an activation energy Ea = 3.85 meV, and the
parameters R0,1,2/R(310) = 0.59, 0.0018, 0.58, respectively. (b) The same data and a ﬁt to similar equations as in (a) but
with a(T ) = a0T 3/2. The parameters of the best ﬁt (red curve) are: a0/R(310) = 1.92 × 10−4, Eg = 87 meV, Ea = 3.2 meV,
R0,1,2/R(310) = 0.60, 2.9 × 10−4, 0.59. In (c) and (d) the data were ﬁtted using Eq. (5) (red curve) with the parameters given in
Table I. The inset in (a-c) expands the data and ﬁts at high temperatures. In (d) each in-parallel contribution to the resistance
is shown separately.
