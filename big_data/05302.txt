Connecting inﬂation with late cosmic acceleration by particle production

A continuous process of creation of particles is investigated as a possible connection between the
inﬂationary stage with late cosmic acceleration. In this model, the inﬂationary era occurs due to
a continuous and fast process of creation of relativistic particles, and the recent accelerating phase
is driven by the non-relativistic matter creation from the gravitational ﬁeld acting on the quantum
vacuum, which ﬁnally results in an eﬀective equation of state less than −1. Thus, explaining
recent results in favor of a phantom dynamics without the need of any modiﬁcations in the gravity
theory has been proposed. Finally, we confront the model with recent observational data of type Ia
Supernova, history of the Hubble parameter, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the cosmic microwave
background.

INTRODUCTION

Recently, Planck Collaboration [1] has presented us
with the most complete image of the early Universe. This
provides strong constraints on the inﬂationary phase. In
particular, the spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar
ratio have been measured to be, ns = 0.9603 ± 0.0073
(68 % CL), and r < 0.10 at a 95% C.L. respectively

particularly, many inﬂationary models may be ruled out
by these bounds.

In the last few years, a large amount of observational
data coming from Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) [2, 3],
Cosmic Microwave Radiation Background (CMB) [4, 5]
and Large Scale Structure (LSS) [6, 7] reveal that the
universe is currently undergoing through an accelerated
expansion. A crucial quantity in the models based on
Einstein gravity aimed at accounting for this expansion
is the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy (DE), i.e.,
wde = pde/ρde, the ratio of the pressure to the energy
density of the dark energy. In the case of the Lambda
cold dark matter, ΛCDM model, this agent can be iden-
tiﬁed with the energy of the quantum vacuum whence
the corresponding EoS parameter is just wΛ = −1. In
spite of the observational success of this model, recent
model-independent measurements of wde seem to favor
[8–11]),
a slightly more negative EoS (see, e.g., Refs.

general relativity, is assume that the DE has your origin
at a phantom ﬁeld [12]. Despite being compatible
with observational data, such a possibility has serious
theoretical problems [13–17]. Other stringent constraints
on the EoS have been analyzed in several contexts, such
as, considering a variable EoS for both dark components
[18], using cosmographic methods to investigate various
dynamic EoS models [19], and a reconstruction of the
dark energy EoS via node-based reconstruction [20].

In a recent work [21], the authors investigated an
alternative to this possibility, namely, that the measured
equation of state, wde, is in reality an eﬀective one, the
equation of state of the quantum vacuum, wΛ = −1,
plus the negative equation of state, wc, associated to
the production of particles by the gravitational ﬁeld
acting on the vacuum. From a joint analysis of data
Supernova type Ia, gamma ray bursts, baryon acoustic
oscillations, and the Hubble rate, it was obtained that
wef f (z = 0) = −1.155+0.076

−0.080 at 1σ.

In this context, one may wonder that the primeval
accelerated expansion of the universe (i.e., the inﬂation-
ary era) could result in a very fast rate of relativistic
particle productions due to action of the gravitational
ﬁeld on the quantum vacuum.
for a suﬃciently
long period of time, this rate was high enough to
compensate, or nearly compensate,
for the dilution
of particles due to the universe expansion, then the
energy density of the particles ﬂuid wound remain nearly
constant giving rise to an inﬂationary expansion. To the
best of our knowledge, this idea was ﬁrst proposed in [22].

If

It is important to mention that inﬂation driven by
the particle production is not a new subject. Particle
creation as a source of inﬂation in the early Universe,
was ﬁrst investigated in [23], using the expressions for
the energy-momentum of the created particles and the
rate of their creation (∝ R2 for non-conformal particles
in a FLRW universe) derived earlier in [24]. However, it
appeared that such model presents some problems, such

[25]

as, they can not produce a suﬃciently low curvature
during inﬂation, and a graceful exit from it. Thus,
success in constructing viable inﬂationary models was
achieved in the Starobinsky model
in which the
dissipation and the creation of matter occurred already
after the end of inﬂation. However, the idea of particle
creation driving inﬂation was revived after that under
the name of warm inﬂation [26]. The aim of this
paper is to explore a possible connection between the
inﬂationary stage with late cosmic acceleration through
of a continuous process of creation of particles by the
gravitational ﬁeld acting on the quantum vacuum [27].

This paper is organized as follows. The next section
brieﬂy sums up the phenomenological basis of particle
creation in an expanding homogeneous and isotropic,
spatially ﬂat, universe. In section 3, we describe the inﬂa-
tionary era as a result of a continuous and fast process of
creation of relativistic particles. In section 3, we present
the dynamics of the universe in the post inﬂationary era
in presence of a continuous matter creation associated
with the production of particles by the gravitational ﬁeld
acting on the vacuum. Section 5 speciﬁes the various sets
of data and the statistical analysis employed to constrain
the model. The concluding section summarizes and gives
comments on our ﬁndings. As usual, the scale factor of
the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric is nor-
malized so that a0 = 1, the naught subscript indicates
the present time.

leads to the appearance of a negative pressure, the
creation pressure pc, which adds to the other pressures
(i.e.,
radiation, baryons, dark matter, and vacuum
pressure) in the stress-energy tensor. These results were
subsequently discussed and generalized in [31], [32], and
[33] by means of a covariant formalism, and were further
conﬁrmed by using relativistic kinetic theory [34, 35].

Since the entropy ﬂux vector of matter, nσuα, where σ
denotes the entropy per particle, must fulﬁll the second
law of thermodynamics (nσuα);α ≥ 0, the constraint Γ ≥
0 readily follows.
For a homogeneous and isotropic universe, with scale
factor a, in which there is an adiabatic process of par-
ticle production 1 from the quantum vacuum, a direct
relationship between the creation pressure and the par-
ticle production rate exists as [31, 33]

Therefore, being pc negative,
it may have produced
the accelerated expansion in the early Universe (i.e.,
inﬂationary era), as well as, it may also drive the present
accelerated cosmic expansion. Here, ρ, p, respectively,
denote the energy density and the pressure of the
corresponding ﬂuid, H = ˙a/a is the Hubble factor, and
as usual, an overdot denotes the diﬀerentiation with
respect to cosmic time.

PARTICLE CREATION

As investigated by Parker and collaborators [28], the
material content of the Universe may have had its origin
in the continuous creation of radiation and matter from
the gravitational ﬁeld of the expanding cosmos acting
on the quantum vacuum, regardless of the relativistic
theory of gravity assumed. In this picture, the produced
particles draw their mass, momentum and energy from
the time-evolving gravitational background which acts
as a “pump” converting curvature into particles.

Prigogine [29] studied how to insert the creation of mat-
ter consistently in Einstein’s ﬁeld equations. This was
achieved by introducing in the usual balance equation for
the number density of particles, (n uα);α = 0, a source
term on the right hand side to account for the production
of particles, namely,

(n uα);α = nΓ ,

(1)

where uα is the particle ﬂuid four-velocity normalized so
that uα uα = 1, and Γ denotes the particle production
rate. According to Parker’s theorem, the production
of relativistic particles is strongly suppressed in the
radiation era [30]. The above equation, when combined
with the second law of thermodynamics, naturally

wc = −(1 + w)

where w = 0 for non-relativistic matter, and w = 1/3 for
relativistic matter.

3. THE INFLATIONARY EPOCH

We consider a spatially-ﬂat Friedmann-Robertson-
Walker (FRW) universe, with Hubble factor H(t) =
˙a(t)/a(t). We assume a universe undergoing a contin-
uous process of particle creation thanks to the action of
the gravitational ﬁeld on the quantum vacuum. The ﬁrst
Friedmann equation reads

1 Originally introduced by I. Prigogine et al., [29] and after in-
vestigated by several authors, the process is adiabatic because
constrains the formulation in which the speciﬁc entropy (per par-
ticle) is constant. Thus, if the speciﬁc entropy is a constant σ, its
variation with respect to the cosmic time is null, i.e., dσ/dt = 0.
This adiabatic matter creation process corresponds to an irre-
versible energy ﬂow from the gravitational ﬁeld to the created
matter constituents.

where Mpl = (8πG)−1/2 is the reduced Planck mass.

Let us consider the possibility that the early inﬂation-
ary phase was the result of a continuous and fast process
of creation of particles, so fast that the energy density ρ
stays practically constant by about 55 e-folds, to decline
quickly afterwards around the GUT era.

To go ahead, an expression for the rate Γ is needed.
We ﬁrst assume that the total rate split into two terms

α =10
α = 15

Γ = Γr + Γdm,

(5)

with Γr referring to the particle creation rate in the early
universe, and Γdm, the particle creation rate of dark mat-
ter particles. Then we adopt the following phenomeno-
logical expressions

Γr = 3Hξ exp[−(αan)],

and

Γdm = 3Hβ[1 − tanh(10 − 12a)],

(6)

(7)

where, ξ, α, n, and β are positive constant parameters.
The parameter n is associated with the decay rate of
the particle production. The higher n, the faster Γr
goes down. Thus,
in order to obtain an inﬂationary
expansion for a suﬃciently long period of time, n must
lie in an interval 0.10 ≤ n ≤ 0.12. Here, we adopt
n = 0.10. For other values within the above range, the
dynamics generated by Γr is practically the same. Let
us consider ξ = 3/4, to eliminate the possibility of an
EoS less than −1 in the inﬂationary era. The constants
α, β are free parameters of the model to be constrained
by the observational data. When a → 0, Γdm gets close
to zero regardless the value of β.
In fact, as we will
see later, Γdm practically does not inﬂuence the cosmic
dynamics for a ≥ 0.6, since in the very early universe,
the production of non relativistic matter is negligible.
Figure 1 shows the ratio Γr/3H in terms of the scale
factor for diﬀerent values of α. From Eqs. (5) – (7), it is
seen that at early times (a ≪ 1) Γ ≃ Γr, and Γ ≃ Γdm,
otherwise.

Let us assume that the dynamics of the very early uni-
verse was dominated by a production of particles given
by Eq. (6). At the end of this phase, the scale factor
will have grown enormously, the production of particles
will have declined sharply, and the transition to the ra-
diation dominated phase occurs. According to Parker’s
theorem, in the latter phase massless particles cannot be
quantum-mechanically produced [30].

FIG. 1: Evolution of wc for diﬀerent values of the parameter
α.

The dynamics of the early inﬂationary era is usu-
ally described by a self-interacting scalar ﬁeld, φ, that
slowly rolls down its potential, V (φ),
in such a way
that the latter dominates the total energy density (i.e.,

˙φ2/2 ≪ V (φ)) during the inﬂationary expansion. It is
therefore illustrative to relate wc to a scalar ﬁeld that
would generate the same amount of inﬂation as the par-
ticle production scenario.

Since ρφ + pφ = ˙φ2, and it must be equal to ρr + pr,
it follows that ˙φ2 = ρr(1 + wc), where ρr represents the
energy density of the relativistic matter.

Hence,

Accordingly,

As a consequence, the total variation of the scalar ﬁeld

during inﬂation is

produced during inﬂation. Generically, total number of
e-folds should be about 60 in order to solve the ﬂatness
and horizon problem of the standard big bang theory.
In fact, the spectrum of ﬂuctuations observed in the
CMB corresponds to the values of N in the interval
50 ≤ N ≤ 60 [1].

Figure 2 shows N as a function of wc for diﬀerent values
of ∆φ. Note that, to produce a suitable number of e-
folds, we must have wc ≃ −1. This is possible provided,

(12)

An obvious condition for the slow-roll is that ¨φ <<

A further important parameter related to the inﬂation-
ary behavior is the tensor-to-scalar ratio r, which quan-
tiﬁes the ratio between the scalar and tensor spectra of
the ﬂuctuations produced in the inﬂationary era. Dur-
ing the slow-roll, r does not evolve much and one may
recover Lyth bound [36] which relates r to the total ﬁeld

From Eq. (10), we have

Considering N = 55 (see Figure 2), we obtain r

for
∆φ = 4Mpl, ∆φ = 3Mpl, ∆φ = 2.5Mpl, and ∆φ = 2Mpl.
In the slow-roll approximation, keeping in mind that
ǫ = η for the model presented in this work, we have
r ≃ 8(1 − ns). Thus, we get ns ≃ 0.959, 0.977, 0.984,
and 0.988, for ∆φ = 4Mpl, ∆φ = 3Mpl, ∆φ = 2.5Mpl,
and ∆φ = 2Mpl, respectively. The Planck collaboration
obtained r < 0.11 (95 % CL), and ns = 0.968+0.006
−0.006 (68
% CL).

The model presented in this section for the particle
creation rate in the very early universe given by Eq. (6)
is in good agreement with the observational data recently
released by the Planck collaboration [1]. The dynamical
consequences of the second term in Eq.(5), Γdm, that
gives the production rate of density matter particles, will
be considered in section 4.

4. THE POST INFLATIONARY ERA

Let us now consider a spatially ﬂat FRW universe dom-
inated by pressureless matter (baryonic plus dark mat-
ter) and the energy of the quantum vacuum (the latter
with EoS pΛ = −ρΛ) in which a process of dark matter
creation from the gravitational ﬁeld, governed by

˙ρdm + 3Hρdm = ρdm Γdm,

(17)

is taking place. Since the production of ordinary particles
is much limited by the tight constraints imposed by local
gravity measurements [37–39], and radiation has practi-
cally negligible impact on the recent cosmic dynamics,
hence, for the sake of simplicity, we assume that the pro-
duced particles are just dark matter particles. In writing
the last equation, we used Eq. (1) specialized to dark
matter particles and the fact ρdm = ndm m, where m
stands for the rest mass of a typical dark matter par-
ticle. Figure 3 shows the evolution of Γdm/3H deﬁned
in Eq. (7) up to present moment (a0 = 1) for diﬀerent
values of β. In particular, for β = 0.1 (shown in the dot-
dashed line), we ﬁnd that, at a = 0.1, Γdm/3H ≃ 10−9;
a = 0.4, Γdm/3H ≃ 10−5; a = 0.7, Γdm/3H ≃ 10−2; and
ﬁnally, at a0 = 1, Γdm/3H ≃ 0.1951.
Since baryons are neither created nor destroyed, their
corresponding energy density obeys ˙ρb + 3Hρb = 0. On
the other hand, as the energy of the vacuum does not
vary with expansion, so ρΛ = constant.

In this scenario the total pressure is pΛ + pc, thereby
the eﬀective EoS is just the sum of the EoS of vacuum
plus that due to the creation pressure,

wef f = −1 −

Γ
3H

.

(18)

Since, by the second law of thermodynamics, Γ is
positive-semideﬁnite, we have that the eﬀective EoS can
be less than −1 without the need of invoking any scalar
ﬁeld with wrong sign in the kinetic term. Therefore,
due to the combined eﬀects of the vacuum and creation
pressures, one can hope for a global EoS less that −1
without the need of any phantom ﬁelds. We mention
that, an equation of state wde < −1, without any
introduction of phantom ﬁelds was ﬁrst realized in the
context of modiﬁed gravity models [40], more speciﬁcally
in the scalar-tensor theory of gravity. However, it is
worth to recall that, we obtain this phantom behavior
without any modiﬁcations in the gravitational theories,
rather by the mechanism of gravitational particle pro-
ductions in an adiabatic manner. We note that, particle
creation in an expanding universe has been discussed
to understand several aspects of modern cosmology.
Recently, the authors in Refs.
[41–43] investigated the
particle production rate in the context of f (R) gravity.
On the other hand, the possible eﬀects of this mechanism
have also been analyzed in case of a ﬂat and negative
curved FRW universes as well [44].

Friedmann’s equation for this scenario is,

5. DATA SETS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES

We ﬁrst describe the set of data used in the statis-
tical analysis. To constrain the free parameters θi =
{β, Ωdm0} of the particle creation model, we use the fol-
lowing sets of data: a) The most recent Type Ia Super-
novae (SNe Ia) data sets from the joint light-curve anal-
ysis (JLA) [45]; b) Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO)
data from the SDSS Luminous Red Galaxy sample [46],
the WiggleZ Survey [7] and 6dF Galaxy Survey [47];
c) Measurements of the Hubble function H(z) com-
piled in [48], plus data by the BOSS collaboration [49],
H(z = 2.34) = 222 ± 7 km s−1 Mpc. Their best ﬁt
values, with their corresponding 1σ uncertainties are
presented in subsection 5.4. These follow from mini-

SNe Ia are very bright standard candles, useful for
measuring cosmological distances. Here, we use the JLA
compilation consisting of 740 well-calibrated SNe Ia in
the redshift range z ∈ [0.01, 1.30] [45]. This collection
of SNe Ia includes about 100 low-redshift SNe from a
combination of various subsamples, ∼ 350 from SDSS at
low to intermediate redshifts, ∼ 250 from SNLS at in-
termediate to high redshifts, and ∼ 10 high-redshift SNe
from the Hubble Space Telescope. All of the SNe Ia have
light curves of high quality, so their distance moduli can
be obtained accurately. These data points are the most
recent SNe Ia present in the literature.

The distance modulus predicted for a given supernova

trix for the observed distance moduli. The latter can be

and the measurement of the ratio of the sound hori-

6. CONCLUSIONS

5.3. History of the Hubble parameter

The diﬀerential evolution of early-type passive galaxies
provides direct measurements of the Hubble parameter,
H(z). An updated compilation of such data was pre-
sented in [48]. We adopt 28 data points in the redshift
range 0.09 < z < 1.75 reported in [48], plus data from the
BOSS colaboration [49], H(z = 2.34) = 222 ± 7 km s−1

As shown by Parker and collaborators, the particle
creation is something expected in expanding spacetime
[28]. In spite of the diﬃculty in deriving the production
rate, this phenomenon may in principle be related with
inﬂation and the present cosmic acceleration [52].

However, the particle creation processes, during the
very rapid early expansion of the universe, are believed

to give rise to temperature anisotropies in the cosmic
microwave background. Within of the context of a
continuous matter creation process in an expanding
universe, the eﬀects on the CMB TT and EE power
spectra were ﬁrst investigated recently in [53].
In the
cosmological context, CMB can be a powerful source
to investigate the properties of an adiabatic matter
creation process to strengthen the cosmological models
driven by the adiabatic particle productions both for
early and late universe.

We have shown here that in the limit of high energies,
the production of relativistic particles from the vacuum
leads to a viable inﬂationary solution, and this dynamics
is in good agreement with the observational data recently

released by the Planck collaboration [1]. Further, we
present an alternative to the recently reported values
of the dark energy equation of state beyond −1, may
arise from the joint eﬀect of the quantum vacuum and
the process of particle production. This oﬀers a viable
alternative to the embarrassing possibility of the scalar
ﬁelds which violate the dominant energy condition,
and give rise to classical and quantum instabilities, and
further do not respect the second law of thermodynamics.

Summarizing, by proper choice of the particle creation
rate, the cosmic scenario presented in this work shows
the evolution of the universe starting from the early
inﬂationary era to the present accelerating phase,
considering a continuous matter creation process by
the gravitational ﬁeld. Obviously, phenomenological
models of particle production diﬀerent from the ones
essayed here are also worth exploring. However, the
most important thing,
from which the cosmological
scenarios could be viewed more clearly, is to determine
the production rate Γ using quantum ﬁeld theory in
curved spacetimes.
