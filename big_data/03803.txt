MANY INTERMINGLED BASINS IN DIMENSION 3

CHRISTIAN BONATTI AND RAFAEL POTRIE

Abstract. We construct a diﬀeomorphism of T3 admitting any
ﬁnite or countable number of physical measures with intermingled
basins. The examples are partially hyperbolic with splitting T T3 =
E cs ⊕ E u and can be made volume hyperbolic and topologically
mixing.

Keywords: Physical measures, partially hyperbolic, intermingled
basins.

1. Introduction

In [K] an example of disjoint attractors with intermingled basins of
attraction was presented. The example posses two invariant measures,
which are generic for positive Lebesgue measure subsets of the mani-
fold while these sets are intermingled in the sense that their Lebesgue
density points are dense in one another (and in the whole manifold).
This seems to be a rare phenomena in the space of all diﬀeomorphisms
(see for example [UV, DVY]) yet it posses some sort of robustness (Kan
example is robust on manifolds with boundary).

The example of [K] admits only two such measures with intermingled
basins, and it was recently proved in [UV] that this is essentially the
only way to present measures with intermingled basins for strongly par-
tially hyperbolic diﬀeomorphisms of 3-manifolds (see below for precise
deﬁnitions).

One may wonder if it is possible to construct examples where more
than 2 disjoint attractors have intermingled basins, and it turns out
to be possible. In [MW, DVY] examples in dimensions ≥ 4 were pre-
sented.
In this paper we give examples in dimension 3, which are
partially hyperbolic (but not strongly partially hyperbolic), and have
an arbitrarily large number of intermingled measures. This answers a
problem posed in [MW, Remark 1.4].

R.P. was partially supported by CSIC group 618.

2. Precise statement of results

2.1. Deﬁnitions. Before we state the main result precisely, we intro-
duce some deﬁnitions.

2.1.1. Partial hyperbolicity. Let f : M → M be a C 1-diﬀeomorphism
and Λ ⊂ M a compact f -invariant subset.

Given a Df -invariant bundle E ⊂ TΛM we say it is uniformly con-
tracted if there exists N > 0 such that for every x ∈ Λ one has
that kDf N |E(x)k < 1
2. A bundle is uniformly expanded if it is uni-
formly contracted for f −1. Given two Df -invariant subbundles E, F ⊂
TΛM we say that F dominates E if there exists N > 0 such that
kDf N|E(x)kkDf −N|F (f N (x))k < 1

2 for every x ∈ Λ.

We say that Λ is:

– a partially hyperbolic set of f if TΛM = E ⊕ F is a Df -invariant
splitting such that F dominates E and either E is uniformly
contracted or F is uniformly expanded.

– a volume hyperbolic set of f if it admits a Df -invariant splitting
TΛM = E ⊕ F such that F dominates E, the jacobian1 of Df
along E is uniformly contracted and the jacobian of Df along
F is uniformly expanded.

– a strongly partially hyperbolic set of f if TΛM = Es ⊕ Ec ⊕ Eu is
a Df -invariant splitting where the bundles Es and Eu are non
trivial, Es is uniformly contracted, Eu is uniformly expanded,
Eu dominates Es ⊕ Ec and Ec ⊕ Eu dominates Es.

See [BDV, Appendix B] for more detailed introduction and relevant
properties. We will use the fact that in a partially hyperbolic set the
strong bundles (the ones which are either uniformly contracted or ex-
panded) integrate uniquely into an f -invariant lamination which will be
called stable lamination or unstable lamination depending on whether
it integrates Es or Eu.

2.1.2. Ergodic attractors and intermingled basins. Given an f -invariant
ergodic measure µ we deﬁne its basin of attraction B(µ) as the set of
points x ∈ M such that for every ϕ ∈ C 0(M) one has that

Xi=0

ϕ(f i(x)) → Z ϕdµ.

1Given a Riemannian metric one can measure the k-dimensional volume along a
k-dimensional subbundle of T M ; the jacobian along a subspace measures how this
volume changes.

INTERMINGLED BASINS

We say that µ is an SRB measure if the Lebesgue measure of B(µ) is
positive. If µ1, . . . , µk are SRB measures2, we say that their basins are
intermingled if for every U open set such that B(µi) ∩ U has positive
Lebesgue measure for some i then B(µj) ∩ U has positive Lebesgue
measure for every j.

If Λ is a partially hyperbolic set saturated by unstable manifolds we
say that a f -invariant measure is a Gibbs-u-state if the disintegration
along unstable manifolds is absolutely continuous (see [BDV, Chapter
11]). In some cases, one can ensure that Λ has a unique Gibbs-u-state
which is also an SRB measure, one paradigmatic such example is when
f is C 2 and the set is mostly contracting (see Section 3 or [BV, DVY]).
We say that a compact f -invariant set Λ is a minimal attractor (in
the sense of Milnor [M]) if the Lebesgue measure of the set of points
x such that ω(x) ⊂ Λ is positive and for every compact f -invariant
proper subset Λ′ ⊂ Λ the set of points x such that ω(x) ⊂ Λ′ has zero
Lebesgue measure. When an SRB measure µ is also a Gibbs-u-state
and it is mostly contracting, it is possible to show that the support of
µ is a minimal Milnor attractor.

2.2. Statements. The main result of this note can be stated as fol-
lows:

Theorem 2.1. For every k ≥ 2, there exists a partially hyperbolic C ∞
diﬀeomorphism f : T3 → T3 with splitting T T3 = Ecs ⊕ Eu admitting
exactly k SRB measures µ1, . . . , µk such that:

– The union of the basins of µi has full Lebesgue measure in T3.
– All their basins are intermingled.
– Their supports are disjoint and if Λi denotes the support of µi
then Λi is strongly partially hyperbolic and mostly contracting
(in particular, the measures µi are Gibbs-u-states and their sup-
port is a minimal Milnor attractor).

Remark 2.2. In fact, it is possible to construct examples with countably
inﬁnitely many intermingled basins by adapting the construction. We
indicate the main steps in this generalisation in section 8.

Remark 2.3. Kan’s example has only two intermingled basins and is
transitive on T2 × [0, 1].
It can be made transitive in T3 by gluing
two copies of the example and interchanging the dynamics; however,
this forbids the example to be topologically mixing (f 2 ceases to be
transitive). Our example can be done topologically mixing by using

2Sometimes, these measures are called physical measures, but in this paper it

will not make a diﬀerence.

4

the liberties we have in the construction, in particular, we use the fact
that the construction can be made volume hyperbolic (this is done in
section 9 ). The construction for having a topologically mixing example
is explained in section 10.

Remark 2.4. In dimension 2 there are results in the direction of the non-
existence of disjoint attractors with intermingled basins. In particular,
in [HHTU] it is shown that a transitive surface C 1+α-diﬀeomorphism
cannot have more than one hyperbolic SRB-measure.

As already said above, [UV] shows that, among strongly partially
hyperbolic diﬀeomorphisms of T3, no more than two basins can be
intermingled. Theorem 2.1 was motivated by a question that arose
in the conference “International Conference on Dynamical Systems”
held at IMPA in November of 2013 during a talk where R. Ures was
presenting the results of [UV]. We thank S. Crovisier, L.Diaz, R. Ures,
M. Viana and J. Yang for useful comments and remarks.

3. Used results and outline of the construction

The main result we will use has to do with the study of the basins of
u-Gibbs measures with negative Lyapunov exponents along the center-
stable direction. The following result from [DVY] generalises the cri-
teria in [K] and depends on the analysis made in [BV] (see also [BDV,
Chapter 11]). Let us ﬁrst introduce some notions.

A partially hyperbolic diﬀeomorphism f : M → M with splitting
T M = Ecs ⊕ Eu is said to be mostly contracting if for every unstable
disk D (i.e. tangent to Eu) there exists a subset D0 ⊂ D with positive
Lebesgue measure (for the induced metric on the disk) such that for
every x ∈ D0 one has that:

(1)

lim sup

n→∞

1
n

log kDf n|E cs(x)k < 0 .

This property is equivalent to having that all u-Gibbs measures have
negative Lyapunov exponents along Ecs.
Indeed, for a C 2-partially
hyperbolic diﬀeomorphism, and D an unstable disk, almost every point
in D converges to some u-Gibbs state (see [BDV, Section 11.2.1]). If
the Lyapunov exponents along Ecs are all negative, then it follows that
condition (1) is veriﬁed.

For a mostly contracting partially hyperbolic diﬀeomorphism, one
deﬁnes a skeleton (c.f. [DVY]) to be a ﬁnite set of hyperbolic periodic
points q1, . . . , qk such that their stable dimension equals dim Ecs and
such that the following conditions hold:

INTERMINGLED BASINS

(S1) for every x ∈ M it follows that the unstable manifold of x

intersects the stable manifold of the orbit of qi for some i,

(S2) if i 6= j it follows that the stable manifold of the orbit of qi and

the unstable manifold of the orbit of qj are disjoint.

The following is a direct consequence of [DVY, Theorem A].

Theorem 3.1. Let f : M → M be a C 2 partially hyperbolic diﬀeo-
morphism with splitting T M = Ecs ⊕ Eu which is mostly contracting.
Assume that S = {q1, . . . , qk} is a skeleton for f and such that, for
every i, the stable manifolds of the orbit of qi is dense, then:

• f has exactly k SRB measures µ1, . . . , µk with disjoint supports
and such that the unstable manifold of the orbit of qi is dense
in the support of µi.

• the union of the basins of the µi cover Lebesgue almost every

point in M and their basins are all intermingled.

Remark 3.2. Under assumption (S1), every u-Gibbs state contains ex-
actly one of the qi. Therefore, one can show that f is mostly contracting
by showing that each qi is contained in the support of a u-Gibbs state
whose Lyapunov exponent is negative. See [BV, DVY].

Using this result let us give a brief outline on how to construct the

examples announced by Theorem 2.1.

We consider a ﬁbered dynamics f0 over a linear Anosov diﬀeomor-
phism A : T2 → T2 of the form (x, t) 7→ (Ax, gx(t)) where we choose A
conveniently so that it has many periodic points and gx : S1 → S1 are
circle diﬀeomorphisms varying smoothly with respect to x ∈ T2.

We choose also a ﬁnite number of points in S1 that we declare to
be ﬁxed by gx for every x ∈ T2. This way, we force the existence of
several minimal W u-saturated subsets of T3 for f0 which is partially
hyperbolic with splitting T T3 = Es ⊕ Ec ⊕ Eu. We also require the gx
to be such that:

• in every one of these minimal sets there will be at least one
periodic point for which the center direction is contracting and
its stable manifold accumulates in the consecutive minimal sets,

• the diﬀeomorphism f0 is mostly contracting.

This can be thought of as a ﬁnite number of Kan examples glued to-
gether. We also require the existence of a circle on which the dynamics
moves in one direction (like saddle nodes in each ﬁxed point, see ﬁgure
1). This is done in Section 4.

Then we perform a modiﬁcation of f0 that can be though of as done

in two steps:

6

C. BONATTI AND R. POTRIE

• First one creates f1, a DA-like deformation along each invariant
tori, in the ﬁxed points associated with the saddle-node circle.
(This is done in Section 5.)

• Then, one pushes the dynamics along the ”hole” created by the
DA-deformation so that the points traverse from one region to
the one which is above. (This is done in Section 6.)

One can then check (see Section 7) that the conditions of Theorem
3.1 are satisﬁed and this is enough to complete the the proof of Theorem
2.1.

Finally, in Section 8 we explain how to extend the construction to
obtain countably inﬁnitely many intermingled basins, in Section 9 we
show how to obtain a volume hyperbolic example and in Section 10 we
study some recurrence properties of the examples.

4. Many Kan’s examples

Let us ﬁx k ≥ 2 an integer, and for simplicity of our presentation,
we will assume that k is divisible by 6 (see Remark 4.1 which expalins
how to adapt the argument in the other cases). We ﬁrst construct a
smooth diﬀeomorphism f0 ∈ Diﬀ ∞(T3) which concatenates k “Kan’s
examples” together.

Let A ∈ SL(2, Z) be a matrix which deﬁnes a linear Anosov dif-
feomorphism gA : T2 → T2. For simplicity, we shall assume that gA
has at least ﬁve ﬁxed points. One can assume moreover that one has
that vectors in Eu
A are
contracted by a factor of λ−1 < 1
A the
gA-invariant stable and unstable foliations which are projections to T2
of the bundles Es

A are expanded by a factor of λ > 5 and in Es

A respectively.

A and Eu

Consider T3 = T2 × S1 with coordinates (x, t) where x ∈ T2 and
t ∈ S1. Take k-points t1, . . . , tk ∈ S1 which are circularly ordered in
S1 (in particular, for the subindices of the ti we shall assume i ∈ Z/kZ
that is k + 1 = 1).

We shall consider f0 : T3 → T3 a C ∞-diﬀeomorphism of the form

f0(x, t) = (gA(x), ϕx(t)) satisfying the following properties:

(P1) ϕx(ti) = ti for every x ∈ T2 and every ti; in other words, the

torus T2 × {ti} is invariant by f0;
2 < |(ϕx)′(t)| < 3

These ﬁxed points will satisfy that (see ﬁgure 1):

(P4) the following connections occur (see ﬁgure 1):

is contained both in the unstable set of pi and the stable
set of qi+1,

(b) every point in the interval

ˆqi × (ti, ti+1) = ˆpi+1 × (ti, ti+1)

is contained both in the stable set of qi and the unstable
set of pi+1,

0 = ˆri+2
. It is for this to make sense in the complete order
that we need that k is divisible by 6. If k were not divisible by 6, simple
modiﬁcations can be made to have a similar picture: For example, one
can start with more ﬁxed points and make more connections between
the tori. This will be evident in the proof.

We have the following property which we will not use but shows why

we say that these are many Kan’s examples glued together.

Proposition 4.2. The diﬀeomorphism f0 is strongly partially hyper-
bolic with splitting T T3 = Es⊕Ec⊕Eu where Ec is the direction tangent
to {x} × S1 and has exactly k SRB measures µ1, . . . , µk such that µi
is supported in T2 × {ti}. The union of their basins has full Lebesgue

measure and the basin of µi has positive measure in every open subset
of T2 × [ti−1, ti+1].

Proof. The fact that f0 is strongly partially hyperbolic follows di-
rectly from condition (P2) and the fact that gA is strongly Anosov in
the directions transverse to the circle ﬁbers. For the claim about the
SRB measures, the proof is exactly the same as in Proposition 11.1 of
[BDV] by using properties (P1)-(P5). See [K, BV] or [DVY] for more
details.

5. The first modification

We will consider a ﬁrst modiﬁcation f1 : T3 → T3 obtained by
0 of DA

making modiﬁcations in each T2 × {ti} around the points ri
type (see for example [BV]).

We continue with the notation of the previous section.
Let ε > 0 be much smaller than the distance between any pair of
tori T2 × {ti} and much smaller than the distance between any of the
points ˆpi, ˆqi, ˆri

0, ˆri

1, ˆri

−1.

We will consider a smooth diﬀeomorphism f1 : T3 → T3 which coin-
0) and such that it has the following

i=1 Bε(ri

cides with f0 outside of Sk

properties:

(M1) the foliation W cs is preserved by f1;
(M2) the tori T2 × {ti} are preserved by f1 and the dynamics along

{ri

0} × S1 remains unchanged for all i,

(M3) there exists a Df1-invariant cone-ﬁeld transverse to W cs and
vectors in this cone-ﬁeld are expanded by a factor of at least 3
by Df1. The cone-ﬁeld is narrow enough so that:
(a) there exists L > 0 such that for every x ∈ T2 and γ a
curve tangent to the cone-ﬁeld of length ≥ L one has that
(W s

A(x, 2ε) × S1) ∩ γ 6= ∅,

(b) there is no curve tangent to the cone-ﬁeld of length smaller
than L joining tori T2 × {ti + ε} with T2 × {ti+1 − ε} for
any i;

(M4) the maximal invariant set in Bε(ri

0) ∩ T2 × {ti} is the point ri
0
which is a hyperbolic source restricted to T2 × {ti} and two
segments connecting ri
0 to two other ﬁxed points which are hy-
perbolic saddles restricted to T2 × {ti}. These two hyperbolic
saddles and not contained in Bε/2(ri

0).

The DA-attractors contained in T2 × {ti} will be called Λi and are
0),

characterised as the maximal invariant sets of f1 in T2 × {ti} \ Bε/2(ri
i.e. the complement of the basin of repulsion of ri

0 in T2 × {ti}.

The fact that such modiﬁcations can be made is quite classical (see

[BDV, Chapter 7] or [BV, Section 6] for similar constructions).

One important feature is the following:

Proposition 5.1. For f1, there exists a unique Gibbs-u-state µi sup-
ported on Λi which is a SRB measure and has negative center Lyapunov
exponents.

Proof. The dynamics of f1 in restriction to each torus T2 × {ti} is
Axiom A plus strong transversality, and admits a unique hyperbolic

10

C. BONATTI AND R. POTRIE

attractor. Therefore, the torus T2 × {ti} supports a unique Gibbs-
u-state supported on Λi, which is indeed the unique SRB measure of
the restriction.
It remains to see that this Gibbs-u-state is an SRB
measure in the ambient manifold T3. For that, it is enough to see that
its transverse Lyapunov exponent is negative.

Using property (P5) one can see that for every x ∈ Λi one has that
there is a positive Lebesgue measure subset of any unstable disk around
x such that the central Lyapunov exponent is negative (the argument is
the same as in [BV], done for Ma˜ne’s example, each unstable manifold
has a full Lebesgue measure subset of points whose orbit spend most
of the time out of the regions where the function ϕ′
x(ti) is ≥ 1 so
the average is negative). This concludes the proof, exactly as in [BV,
Theorem B].

(cid:3)

It is also rather simple to obtain that {q1, . . . , qk} is a skeleton. We

will use the following result which will be important later too:
Lemma 5.2. The stable manifold of qi contains W s

A(ˆqi, 3ε)×(ti−1, ti+1).

Proof. For f0, the stable manifold of qi is exactly W s
Moreover, the set W s
j=1 Bε(rj

A(ˆqi)×(ti−1, ti+1).
A(ˆqi, 3ε) × (ti−1, ti+1) is forward invariant and dis-
0), so, as f1 coincides with f0 outside Sk
j=1 Bε(rj
0)

joint from Sk

one obtains the statement.

(cid:3)

We then obtain:

Proposition 5.3. The diﬀeomorphism f1 is mostly contracting and
the set {q1, . . . , qk} is a skeleton.

Proof. To show that property (S1) is veriﬁed, it is enough to show
that every unstable manifold intersects the stable manifold of one of
the qi. Indeed, if x ∈ T2 × {ti} it is immediate that W u(x) intersects
the stable manifold of qi as Λi is the unique attractor inside T2 × {ti}
and it is hyperbolic.

If a point x belongs to T2 ×(ti, ti+1) then it follows immediately from
(M2) and Lemma 5.2 that W u(x) intersects both the stable manifold
of qi and the stable manifold of qi+1. This establishes (S1).

Using Remark 3.2 and Proposition 5.1 we get that f1 is mostly con-

tracting.

It remains to show that {q1, . . . , qk} verify property (S2), but this
is immediate from the fact that the unstable manifold of qi is entirely
contained in T2 × {ti}.

(cid:3)

INTERMINGLED BASINS

Remark 5.4. It is easy to show that the stable manifold of qi is dense
in T2 × (ti−1, ti+1). Indeed, given an open set U ⊂ T2 × (ti−1, ti+1),
one can take an unstable arc I ⊂ U and after forward iteration, using
property (M3) and the fact that the set T2 × (ti−1, ti+1) is f1-invariant
one obtains that f n
A(ˆqi, 3ε) × (ti−1, ti+1) which is con-
tained in W s(qi) by Lemma 5.2. Due to invariance, it holds that the
closure of the stable manifold of qi is therefore exactly T2 × [ti−1, ti+1]
and this is why we need to make a further perturbation to obtain the
desired example.

6. Second modification, a small smooth perturbation

We will now make a very small smooth perturbation of f1 in order
to break the invariance of the tori T2 × {ti} so that having all basins
intermingled becomes possible.

The perturbation is made as follows. We consider f : T3 → T3
which is C r-close to f1 and is obtained by composing f1 with a diﬀeo-
morphisms ρj supported on Bε/2(rj

0).

The diﬀeomorphisms ρj are the time 1 maps of the ﬂow of a vector
∂t where ηj : M → [0, 1] is a smooth bump function
0). Notice that ρj is

ﬁeld3 X = δηj ∂
which equals zero outside Bε/2(rj
arbitrarily C r close to the identity as δ → 0.

0) and 1 in Bε/4(rj

Let us make some remarks about the properties of f if δ is small

enough:

(R1) conditions (M1) and (M3) of f1 still hold for f as the pertur-

bation preserves the leafs of W cs and it is C 1-small;

(R2) f is mostly contracting and {q1, . . . , qk} is a skeleton. This
holds because the sets Λi are disjoint from the support of the
perturbation and therefore their u-Gibbs states remain with
negative Lyapunov exponents, property (S1) is C 1-open and
property (S2) still holds as the sets Λi, which coincide with
the closure of the unstable manifold of qi remain unchanged.
Indeed, Lemma 5.2 still holds and the proof of Proposition 5.3
works exactly the same;

(R3) no point remains in Bε/2(ri
The diﬀeomorphism f is the diﬀeomorphism announced in Theorem
2.1. By property (R2) it is enough to show that the stable manifolds of
qi are dense in T3 for all i in order to be in the conditions of Theorem
3.1, this is done in Section 7.

reason for which f cannot be strongly partially hyperbolic can be found
in [UV].

7. Density of the stable manifold

To conclude the proof of the main theorem, we need to show that the
stable manifold of each qi is dense which is the content of Proposition
7.5 below. For this, we need ﬁrst a deﬁnition and some preliminary
lemmas.

If a hyperbolic saddle periodic point of f has two contracting eigen-
values of diﬀerent moduli, then on deﬁne both stable manifold W s(x)
and strong stable manifold W ss(x) corresponding respectively to the
eigenvalues of moduli smaller than one and of smallest modulus. The
strong stable manifold of x cuts the stable manifold in two components,
called stable separatrices of x.

If x belongs to one of the Λi ⊂ T2 × {ti}, then its local stable and
strong stable manifolds for f coincide with the ones for f1. Thus the
local strong stable manifold of x is contained in the torus T2 × {ti},
when the local stable manifold is a 2-disc transverse to T2 × {ti}. Thus
the transverse orientation of the tori T2 ×{ti} ⊂ T2 ×SS1 (given by the
orientation of the circle SS1) allows us to denote naturally by W s
+(x)
and W s

−(x) the two stable separatrices of x ∈ Λi.

Notice that the boundary of the stable manifold W s(qi) in the center
stable leaf W cs(qi) (in the intrinsic topology of W cs(qi)) contains the

stable manifolds of pi−1 and pi+1 (which are one-dimensional). With
our convention, the upper W s
−(qi)) separatrix of qi
accumulates (in the topology of W cs(qi)) on W s(pi+1) (resp. W s(pi−1)).

+(qi) (resp. lower W s

We now state some lemmas that will be needed.
Lemma 7.1. For all i ∈ {1, . . . , k} one has that4

(2)

±(qi) = [n
W s

f −n(W s

A(ˆqi, 3ε) × [ti, ti±1)) .

Proof. One notices that the set ˆW = W s
A(ˆqi, 3ε) × (ti−1, ti+1) is con-
tained in W s(qi) for f0 and inside there, W s
A(ˆqi, 3ε) × {ti} corresponds
to the intersection with the strong stable manifold for f0. Since the
forward iterates of the points in ˆW by f0 remain in ˆW and ˆW is disjoint
from the perturbation region to obtain f1 and f , one deduces that ˆW is
contained in the stable manifold of qi for f and that W s
A(ˆqi, 3ε) × {ti}
contains a fundamental domain of the strong stable manifold. Now
it is clear that iterating backwards one obtains the complete invariant
manifolds and since orientation is preserved one concludes that the half
spaces also have the desired property.

(cid:3)

The following is a restatement of the classical λ-Lemma for manifolds

with boundary in our context (see ﬁgure 3).

Lemma 7.2. Let x be a hyperbolic ﬁxed point of f with two eigenvalues
of diﬀerent modulus and both smaller than one. Let D be a half disk5
so that

• there exists z ∈ ∂D ∩ W u(x) such that TzD ⊕ W u(x) = Tz T3 ,
• the limit of Df −n(Tz∂D) converges as n → ∞ to the eigenspace

of the smallest modulus of Dxf .

Then one has that f −n(D) converges in compact parts to either W s
or W s

−(x) depending on the orientation of D with respect to z ∈ ∂D.

+(x)

Proof. This is a very standard result. We refer the reader to e.g
[BCGP, Page 4860] for a very similar statement with proof.

(cid:3)

Remark 7.3. The classical λ-Lemma implies that if z is in the interior
of D then f −n(D) converges in compact parts to the whole W s(x).
Lemma 7.4. The closure of W s
W s

−(qi) in T3 contains W s

Proof. Since W ss(qi) ∩ W u(ri

lower disk of the stable manifold W s(qi) and the backward iterates of
its tangent space converges to the eigenspace of smallest eigenvalue
f since the set Λi is strongly partially hyperbolic. As the set

the closures of all stable manifolds of qi all coincide and therefore are
dense (e.g. as {q1, . . . , qk} is a skeleton).

This implies that all basins are intermingled by Theorem 3.1 and

8. Countably many SRB measures with intermingled

basins

In this section we will explain how some modiﬁcations to the con-
struction above allow to construct an example with countably many
intermingled basins.

For this to be possible, one will start with countably many tori
accumulating in a given one from one side. We denote, as before
f0 : T3 → T3 to such a diﬀeomorphism and we assume the tori are
Tn = T2 × {1/n} and T∞ = T2 × {0} the limit torus where we are
considering S1 = [0, 1]/0∼1 and n ≥ 2.

For the initial dynamics, every tori Tn will support an SRB measure
µn (mostly contracting) except the limit one. Notice that one is forced
to make the Lyapunov exponents in each such measure to go to 0 as

16

C. BONATTI AND R. POTRIE

the limit measure µ∞ in T∞ cannot have negative nor positive center
Lyapunov exponents. As we will not be able to ”cross” the torus T∞
we will be forced to make connections going ”up” and ”down”. This
means that conditions (P1)-(P5) will have to be addapted accordingly
to have at least 7 ﬁxed points and construct in each torus a ﬁxed point
which in the center:

• is attracting (qi)
• one which is repelling (pi)
• one saddle node going up (as the ri

0) but also one going down

(call them si

0) which have corresponding si+1

1

and si−1
−1 .

Now, the construction of the DA deformation to obtain f1 has to be
done in two steps, ﬁrst, one has to slow down the stable exponents of
all the ﬁxed points in T∞ which will be limits of ri
0 and si
0 so that the
modiﬁcations can be done without loosing the regularity.

Now, as the DA-diﬀeomorphisms are C ∞ close to diﬀeomorphisms
of tori having points with zero stable exponents in the ﬁxed points,
one can construct f1 by opening in each ri
0 but of course the
amount one opens goes to zero as i → ∞. The same statements we
have obtained in Section adapted accordingly hold for this f1, there are
two points to be careful:

0 and si

• The limit torus T∞ admits a Gibbs-u-state which is not an SRB
measure. In particular, the sequence {q2, . . . , qn, . . .} is not a
skeleton. However, their stable manifolds intersect the unstable
manifold of every point which does not intersect T∞.

• Not being a skeleton, the property is no longer robust, but it is

if one makes a C 1 perturbation which is the identity in T∞.

Finally, one makes a small C ∞-perturbation f of f1 which pushes up
0. This is the desired example

in the middle of the ri
and properties of Section 6 hold accordingly.

0 and down in the si

To see that all basins are intermingled, again, one has to use an
adaptation of Theorem 3.1 as the set of points {qn}n is not really a
skeleton. But the proofs adapt directly (as one shows that the basins
are pairwise intermingled). Showing the density of the stable manifolds
of the points qi requires a bit more work as one has points moving up
and down, but a more careful use of Lemmas 7.1 and 7.2 give that:

Lemma 8.1. The closure of W s
and the closure of W s

−(qi) of qi contains W s
−(qi+2) and W s

+(qi) contains W s

+(qi−2) and W s
+(qi+1).

−(qi−1);

Putting all this together, one obtains an example with countably

many intermingled basins.

9. Volume hyperbolicity

In this section we will show how one can ensure that the splitting
T T3 = Ecs⊕Eu of f is volume hyperbolic by making some of the choices
in the construction of f1 and f more precise. This will help proving
the topological mixing of a speciﬁc example in the next section.

One must add a new property to the modiﬁcation made for f1 which
involves some constants that we will choose appropriately when con-
structing f .

(M5) There are constants ξ, ζ > 0 such that outside the ζ-neighborhood

of the points ri
0 the volume along Ecs is contracted by Df1 by a
factor 1/2 and the maximum dilatation of volume of Df1 along
Ecs in all of T3 is of 1 + ξ.

Notice that for f0 one has volume contraction along Ecs of a factor
at least 1/3 as the contraction along Es is smaller than 1/5 and the
expansion along Ec smaller than 3/2 and these are orthogonal. As in
a neighborhood of ri
0 for f1 there is some half disc which is mapped
outside itself, one needs some amount of expansion, which we are con-
trolling with condition (M5) to be not so large and concentrated in a
small neighborhood of ri
0. The fact that the area expansion can be
bounded follows from the fact that for f0 the derivative of ri
0 along Ec
equals one as it is a saddle node point.

An important remark is that, if one ﬁxes ζ ≪ ε, the size of a per-
turbation of f1 which will verify conditions (R1)-(R3) can be chosen
independent of the constant ξ. Using this remark, one can choose δ
(for the perturbation of f1 giving rise to f ) in order that the number
of iterates that a point remains in Bζ(ri
0) is uniformly bounded by a
constant N0 which is independent of ξ. Now, let N1 > 0 be such that
f k(Bζ(ri
0) = ∅ if i 6= j and 1 ≤ k ≤ N1, notice that as ζ ≪ ε
such an N1 ≥ 2 exists and it is independent of ξ too. The perturbation
made to create f from f1 can be chosen to be a translation in each
Bζ(ri
0) for every i and therefore does not change the rate of contraction
of area along Ecs.

0)) ∩ Bζ(rj

It follows that if one chooses ξ small enough so that (1+ξ)N0( 1

2)N1 < 1
one obtains that Df |E cs contracts the area uniformly and therefore f
is volume hyperbolic.

10. Topologically mixing examples

In this section we will indicate some variants on the construction
that allow to obtain an example which is topologically mixing. We
will use some classical results on robust heterodimensional cycles and

18

C. BONATTI AND R. POTRIE

blenders to which we refer the reader to [BDV, Chapters 6 and 7] for
a broad introduction. To obtain this property, we need to introduce
some additional properties to the ones presented in Section 4 to f0 in
order to guarantee those properties.

These are:
(P6) The diﬀeomorphism gA has two additional ﬁxed points, ˆa and

ˆb.

(P7) In a small neighborhood of ˆa the map ϕx : S1 → S1 restricted
to [t1, t2] has exactly three hyperbolic ﬁxed points, t1, t2 which
are attracting and a point ta ∈ (t1, t2) which is repelling . We
call the ﬁxed point a = (ˆa, ta) of f0.

(P8) In a small neighborhood of ˆb the map ϕx : S1 → S1 restricted
to [t1, t2] has exactly three hyperbolic ﬁxed points, t1, t2 which
are repelling6 and a point tb ∈ (t1, t2) which is attracting . We
call the ﬁxed point b = (ˆb, tb) of f0.

(P9) The points A and B are connected by a robust cycle and the
closure of their stable and unstable manifolds coincide robustly.
There are many ways to construct examples with this properties.
We refer the reader to [BD, BDK] for similar constructions. The key
feature is the use of blenders which we avoid to deﬁne here. We will
also choose the construction of f so that it is volume hyperbolic as
explained in Section 9.

With this additional properties, one can show:

Proposition 10.1. The diﬀeomorphism f is topologically mixing.

Proof. As a direct consequence of the λ-Lemma we know that if there
is a hyperbolic ﬁxed point P for which both the stable and unstable
manifold are dense, then f is topologically mixing.

We need to show that the stable and unstable manifold of, say, a are
dense. Using property (P9) (which persists after the modiﬁcations) it
is enough to show that the stable manifold of b as well as the unstable
manifold of a are dense.

The fact that the stable manifold of b is dense follows exactly as for

the points qi (see Proposition 7.5).

The density of the unstable manifold of a is more involved and uses

the volume hyperbolicity of f .

First, we show that the union of the unstable manifolds of the points
pi is dense in T3. Notice that this union contains the unstable man-
ifold of the circle {ˆpi} × S1 which is normally hyperbolic, denote as

6This means that one has to adapt (P5) to take this into account.

loc = W u

A(ˆpi, 3ε) × S1 its local unstable manifold (as there are no per-
W u
turbations in this region, see Lemma 7.1 for an identical argument). As
W cs remains unchanged and is minimal, it follows that for each point
x ∈ T3 the center stable leaf W cs(x) is intersected by W u
loc in two circles
leaving a bounded cylinder containing x and with uniformly bounded
area. Using volume hyperbolicity, this implies that the forward iterates
of W u

loc become dense proving our claim.

Now, we show that all the pi are homoclinically related, therefore,
their unstable manifolds are all dense. Indeed, each pi is homoclinically
1 and the stable manifold of pi+1 intersects the unstable
related with ri
manifold of ri
1 transversally, therefore the stable manifold of pi+1 inter-
sects the unstable manifold of pi transversally. Inductively, one obtains
that all pi are homoclinically related. As a byproduct of this argument,
using remark 7.3 one obtains that the positive unstable separatrix of
ri
1 is dense in T3 for every i as the stable manifold of pi intersects its
interior transversally and its unstable manifold is dense. Notice that
the positive unstable separatrix is well deﬁned in analogy to the ones
deﬁned in Section 7.

To conclude, it is therefore enough to show that the stable manifold
of some ri
1 intersects the unstable manifold of a with a conﬁguration
as in Lemma 7.2. Recall that that the unstable manifold of a consists
of the backward iterates of W u
A(ˆa, 3ε) × (t1, t2). Therefore, one gets
that the strong stable manifold of r1
0 intersects the boundary of W u(a)
(relative to the unstable manifold of the normally hyperbolic circle
{ˆa} × S1) and one can apply Lemma 7.2 to get density of the unstable
manifold of a as it will become dense in the positive half unstable
manifold of r1

0. This concludes the proof of the proposition.
