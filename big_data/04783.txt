Myosin motor proteins drive vigorous steady-state ﬂuctuations in the actin cytoskeleton of cells.
Endogenous embedded semiﬂexible ﬁlaments such as microtubules, or added ﬁlaments such as
single-walled carbon nanotubes are used as novel tools to non-invasively track equilibrium and
non-equilibrium ﬂuctuations in such biopolymer networks. Here we analytically calculate shape
ﬂuctuations of semiﬂexible probe ﬁlaments in a viscoelastic environment, driven out of equilib-
rium by motor activity. Transverse bending ﬂuctuations of the probe ﬁlaments can be decomposed
into dynamic normal modes. We ﬁnd that these modes no longer evolve independently under
non-equilibrium driving. This eﬀective mode coupling results in non-zero circulatory currents in
a conformational phase space, reﬂecting a violation of detailed balance. We present predictions
for the characteristic frequencies associated with these currents and investigate how the temporal
signatures of motor activity determine mode correlations, which we ﬁnd to be consistent with recent
experiments on microtubules embedded in cytoskeletal networks.

Living cells are a prime example of active matter, typ-
ically driven out of thermodynamic equilibrium by in-
ternal molecular force generators [1–4].
In cytoskeletal
networks, myosin motors are the dominant actors driv-
ing non-equilibrium dynamics [5–10], which can be cap-
tured in simpliﬁed reconstituted systems [11–16]. Myosin
motors generate mechanical force by coupling the hydrol-
ysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to conformational
changes in a mechano-chemical cycle [5]. Energy dissipa-
tion drives unidirectional transitions between molecular
states in this cycle and breaks detailed balance. Recently,
it was demonstrated that such molecular breaking of de-
tailed balance can give rise to circulating probability cur-
rents in a phase space of collective degrees of freedom in
cellular systems [10]. However, for active biological net-
works it is unclear if and how broken detailed balance
propagates from molecular-scale dynamics to large-scale
collective dynamics. An elegant way of non-invasively in-
vestigating the dynamics of cytoskeletal networks across
a range of length scales is to track embedded probe ﬁla-
ments such as microtubules [12] or single-walled carbon
nanotubes [8]. A careful analysis of the shape ﬂuctua-
tions of such a probe ﬁlament can reveal the active na-
ture of its environment including potential violations of
detailed balance, but a theory for the stochastic dynam-
ics of these systems is still lacking.

Here, we develop an analytical theory describing the
non-equilibrium dynamics of a large probe ﬁlament em-
bedded in an active viscoelastic gel as a model for a
cytoskeletal network with spatially distributed motors
(Fig. 1). We derive a Fokker-Planck description of the
statistical properties in a conﬁgurational phase space
spanned by the bending modes of the probe ﬁlament. Un-

der steady-state conditions, we ﬁnd rotational currents
in this mode space, demonstrating a breaking of detailed
balance. Conceptually, the breakdown of detailed bal-
ance in mode space is found to arise from a nonuniform
spatial distribution of the active forces acting on the ﬁla-
ments, where sites that experience higher motor activity
dissipate mechanical energy along the probe ﬁlament. We
consider the appropriate dynamic normal modes of the
probe ﬁlaments. These modes evolve independently in
thermodynamic equilibrium. We ﬁnd that motor activity
selectively enhances bending ﬂuctuations on a character-
istic length scale that stems from the balance between
ﬁlament bending elasticity and network shear elasticity,
as observed in experiments [12]. Motor activity further-
more induces correlations between the dynamic normal
modes. It can be seen in our model that such correlations
between the bending modes arise from motor force events
exciting several modes simultaneously which then decay
at diﬀerent rates. This results in current loops with char-
acteristic frequencies in the conﬁgurational phase space
spanned by the bending modes. These currents are a
telltale signature of non-equilibrium dynamics and can
in principle be inferred directly from experiments [10],
providing a noninvasive method to identify and quantify
nonequilibrium dynamics in active systems.

Building on previous work [6, 17], we propose a model
describing the ﬂuctuations of a semiﬂexible probe ﬁla-
ment of length L embedded in a homogeneous viscoelas-
tic network at temperature T . Randomly distributed
motors are added to this gel and exert forces on the
ﬁlaments (e.g.
actin ﬁlaments) forming the network.
Stresses then propagate through the gel and act on the
probe ﬁlament at entanglement points between this ﬁl-

ament and the network, as sketched in Fig. 1. We as-
sume that both thermal forces and motor forces that
are propagated through the network induce small trans-
verse ﬂuctuations of the probe ﬁlament. To capture these
ﬂuctuations, we parameterize the shape of the weakly
undulating ﬁlament at time t by the transverse deﬂec-
tion r⊥(s, t) along its arc length s.
Such transverse
deﬂections result in a restoring force per unit length
fbend = −κ∂4r⊥/∂s4 (s, t), assuming the ﬁlament can be
described as an inextensible worm-like chain [18–20] with
a bending rigidity κ. When the probe ﬁlament bends, the
resulting network deformations also exert forces on the

ﬁlament, fnetwork =(cid:82) t

−∞ dt(cid:48)α(t − t(cid:48))r⊥(s, t(cid:48)), where the

memory kernel α(t) represents the response function to a
transverse force, capturing the viscoelastic properties of
the embedding medium.

FIG. 1. (color online) Schematic of the model: A semiﬂexi-
ble probe ﬁlament (blue) is embedded in a crosslinked actin-
myosin network (light grey). Actin ﬁlaments in the network
are contracted by engaged myosin motors (red). This active
network interacts with the probe ﬁlament through entangle-
ment points (black dots) spaced at a length scale (cid:96)M, inducing
non-equilibrium bending ﬂuctuations in the ﬁlament.

The probe ﬁlament is entangled with the network at
crossing points that are separated by a length, (cid:96)M, of
the order of the mesh-size. Thus, we will assume that
active forces act on the probe ﬁlament at sites si, with
a typical separation (cid:96)M along the ﬁlament. These active
forces are due to nearby motors scattered in the network
and are taken to have an average amplitude fi. Under
these assumptions, the total motor-induced forces on the
probe ﬁlament can be approximated as

t(cid:90)

fM(s, t) ≈(cid:88)

fiTi(t)δ (s − si) .

We model the dynamics of active forces, fiTi(t), at the
point where they act on the probe ﬁlament as indepen-
dent random step-like processes with a constant ampli-
tude |fi|. For simplicity, we ignore ﬂuctuations in the
active force amplitude. In other words, the temporal be-
havior of a single motor is assumed to be a telegraph
process: T (t) switches randomly from zero (motor not
engaged) to one (motor engaged) at a rate τ−1
oﬀ , and back
to zero at a rate τ−1
on . The autocorrelation of the motor
forces is then [21]

where τ−1

and C2 = τonτoﬀ / (τon + τoﬀ )2 are dimensionless con-
stants. Although this is a simple model for the dynam-
ics of motor-generated forces, the corresponding power
spectrum S(ω) with frequency ω is Lorentzian. Such
a Lorentzian spectrum captures the essential features
observed in experiments [6–9] of becoming white-noise-
like, S(ω) ∼ const, for low frequencies, while following a
power-law S(ω) ∝ ω−2, for high frequencies.

ﬁlament r⊥(s, t) = L(cid:80)

It is convenient to expand the deﬂections of the probe
k ak(t)yq(s) into a sum of orthog-
onal eigenmodes yq(s) of the beam equation γ∂r⊥/∂t =
−κ∂4r⊥/∂s4 with free boundary conditions at the ends
[19]. In the space of these yq(s)-modes with wave vector

q, the equation of motion of the probe ﬁlament becomes

dt(cid:48) α(t − t(cid:48))aq(t(cid:48)) = −κq4aq(t) + fM,q(t) + ξq(t). (3)

jected motor-induced force fM,q(t) =(cid:80)

This equation describes the force balance fnetwork =
fbend + fM + ξ, with thermal forces ξ. Indexed quantities
in Eq. (3) denote projected variables, such as the pro-
i fi/L yq(si)Ti(t).
In reconstituted actin networks and live cells, myosin
activity has been found to lead to enhanced ﬂuctuations
of the bending modes of embedded microtubules [8, 12].
Motivated by these experiments, we derived analytical
predictions of mode ﬂuctuations using realistic values for
the time scales of myosin activity. The Fourier trans-
form of the memory kernel ˆα(ω) (Eq. (3)) is related to
the bulk shear modulus G(ω) of the medium through
ˆα(ω) = A G(ω), with a constant A, which depends on
the geometry of the probe [22, 23]. Here we use A ≈ 4π,
with corrections depending logarithmically on the dimen-
sions of the probe ﬁlament [5]. For low enough frequen-
cies, the viscoelastic properties of crosslinked networks
of semiﬂexible polymers can be approximated as a sim-
ple elastic solid in a solvent with G(ω) ≈ G0 − iηω,
where η is the viscosity experienced by the ﬁlament. In
general, the rheology of crosslinked actin networks can
be characterized by two frequency regimes [26]: a low-
frequency plateau regime with modulus G0 [24, 25], and a
high-frequency regime where the complex shear modulus
scales as G(ω) ∼ (−iω)3/4 [25]. However, the latter typ-
ically sets in at frequencies of order 100 Hz [26], beyond
the regime where motor-generated ﬂuctuations typically
dominate, and therefore will not be considered.

Evenly spaced interaction sites sn were placed along the probe

implies that relaxation times inferred from mode ﬂuc-
tuations will converge to the motor time scale for high
enough mode number, consistent with our Brownian dy-
namics simulations of ﬁlaments in active viscoelastic me-
dia, as shown in Fig. 2(c). To compare our theoret-
ical predictions (Eqs. (S4) and (S5)) with experimen-
tally recorded ﬂuctuations, it is convenient to consider
the backbone angle θ(s, t) ≈ ∂r⊥(s, t)/∂s instead of the
lateral deﬂection r⊥(s, t) [28]; θ-mode amplitudes bq are
related to the r⊥-modes through bq(t) = Lq aq(t). The

predicted θ-mode ﬂuctuations, (cid:104)∆b2
2(cid:104)bq(t+∆t)bq(t)(cid:105), exhibit enhanced ﬂuctuations near the
characteristic wave vector q∗ ∼ (G0/κ)1/4, as shown in
Figs. 2a,b. This scaling law was derived for an inﬁnite
rod in a purely elastic medium [31] and is both discussed
and experimentally observed by Brangwynne et al. [12].
Here we recover this characteristic length scale as the
scale where active ﬂuctuations calculated in our analytic
model reach a maximum.

q(∆t)(cid:105) = 2(cid:104)b2

We now consider the low-frequency dynamics of the
probe ﬁlament, i.e. ﬂuctuations at frequencies small com-
pared to the rate of motor-driven events ω < 2π/τM.
At such low frequencies, motor correlation times become
negligible, allowing us to approximate the telegraph pro-
cess Tn(t) (see Eq. (2)) as white noise. Thus, the low-
frequency limit enables us to describe the noise terms in
Eq. (3) by simple statistical processes, such that both
thermal ξq(t) and motor-induced processes fM,q(t) can
be combined in a single stochastic term ψq(t), with a
correlator (cid:104)ψq(t)ψw(t(cid:48))(cid:105) = 2γ2Dq,wδ (t − t(cid:48)), where the

An example of the matrix of coupling coeﬃcients Fq,w
(see also Eq. (S5)) is shown in the inset of Fig. 3 with pa-
rameters typical for a probe ﬁlament in an actin-myosin
network and with a regular distribution of motor interac-
tion points si. In this case, modes of diﬀerent parity do
not couple due to symmetry, while, for instance, modes
located on the 7 − 7 oﬀ-diagonal couple strongly in this
example.
It is important to note that an uneven local
distribution of active forces along the probe ﬁlament in
a disordered network will in general lead to coupling be-
tween even and odd modes. We also ﬁnd that the cou-
pling strength decreases with increasing density of motor
interaction points 1/(cid:96)M (Fig. 3). The coupling coeﬃ-
cients must indeed vanish for high motor density, since
in this limit the coupling coeﬃcients are given by the
inner product of two orthogonal modes. Furthermore,
when performing an ensemble average over all possible
locations of the probe ﬁlament in the network, the distri-
bution of active forces along the ﬁlament will converge to
a uniform distribution, resembling the high motor density
limit, again with no eﬀective coupling between modes.

The nondiagonal structure of the diﬀusion matrix
(Eq. (7)) has important implications for the non-
equilibrium dynamics of the system. We explore these
implications by developing a Fokker-Planck description
of the dynamics of the probability density, ρ((cid:126)a, t), where
(cid:126)a is the bending mode amplitude vector. This probabil-
ity density satisﬁes the continuity equation ∂ρ
where the current density (cid:126)j is given by

∂t = −(cid:126)∇ · (cid:126)j,

Kj,k = −(cid:0)κq4

(cid:126)j((cid:126)a, t) = K(cid:126)aρ ((cid:126)a, t) − D(cid:126)∇ρ ((cid:126)a, t) .

(8)

Here, K and D denote the deterministic matrix

(Eq. (7)). In general, broken detailed balance, i.e. ﬁnite
(cid:126)j((cid:126)a, t), is ensured when (KD)q,w (cid:54)= (KD)w,q, indepen-
dent of the choice of the coordinate system [1, 30].

To investigate the behavior of our model, we plotted
the steady-state probability and current distributions in
the a1×a3 plane (Fig. 4 (a)), integrating out all other de-
grees of freedom. The currents exhibit a clockwise circu-
lation in this plane of mode space as shown by the white
arrows.
Importantly, the breaking of detailed balance
in this mode space does not arise from energy exchange
between bending modes, but rather from how stochastic
motor forces induce mode correlations. In the absence of
motor forces, these modes would evolve independently,
such that the system could be described by a series of
uncoupled 1D systems. Perhaps counter-intuitively, we
expect the coupling and therewith the currents also to
vanish in the limit of high motor density (Fig. 3).

freedom were integrated out. Colors indicate the value of the
non-equilibrium probability density ρ((cid:126)a) and white arrows in-
dicate the magnitude of probability ﬂux (cid:126)j((cid:126)a). Parameters
were set to model a microtubule in an actin network with pa-
rameters as in Fig. 2, τM = 0.3 s, (cid:96)M = 1.6 µm and f = 10 pN.
(b) Non-equilibrium probability (a1 × a3 plane) and current
distributions for modes 1, 3 and 5 where the full current pro-
ﬁle was retained. Parameters were chosen as in (a).

It is illuminating to study the projections of the prob-
ability currents onto diﬀerent mode space planes. We
calculated the joint probability and current distribution
in the a1×a3×a5 subspace, as shown in Fig. 4(b). A slow
circulation around the a3 axis is accompanied by a faster
circulation around the a1 axis, reﬂecting the decrease of
the relaxation time τj with increasing mode number j.
The precise structure of the currents is determined by
the geometrical details of the interaction of motors with
the probe ﬁlament, as described by the coupling coeﬃ-
cients Fq,w (see Fig. 3).

A circulating current implies a preferred sense of rota-
tion in conﬁgurational space of the underlying stochastic
dynamics, with an associated cycling frequency ωq,w that
scales with the magnitude of the current. To obtain an
estimate for this frequency ωq,w, we focus on the ori-
gin of the probability current, the active force term fM.
From the active mode correlators (Eq. (S5)) we obtain
the mode-correlation matrix C in the limit τM/τq (cid:28) 1,
which we use to solve the Fokker-Planck equation with

white-noise. This yields a closed-form of the probability
ﬂux (cid:126)j((cid:126)a) = Ω(cid:126)aρ((cid:126)a), where Ω = (K + DC−1) (see SI).
Under steady-state conditions, (cid:126)j((cid:126)a) is purely rotational
because (cid:126)∇·(cid:126)j = 0, implying purely imaginary eigenvalues
of Ω, which constitute the cycling frequencies associated
with the circular probability currents [1]. It is useful to
consider the leading-order term in an expansion of this
cycling frequency into a power series of the coupling co-
eﬃcient Fq,w,

The sign of this frequency indicates the direction of the
current circulation in mode space (Fig. 4). This under-
lines that detailed balance in a space of normal mode
amplitudes of the ﬁlament is broken if and only if mo-
tor activity drives several modes with diﬀerent relaxation
times at once such that Fq,w (cid:54)= 0. Motor activity impacts
the ﬁlament on the scale (cid:96)M, inducing a coupling between
the bending modes of the ﬁlament. In contrast, thermal
forces impact the ﬁlament homogeneously, and thus do
not introduce coupling between diﬀerent bending modes.
Interestingly,
if we consider an ensemble of ﬁlaments
dispersed throughout a random network, each ﬁlament
will sample a diﬀerent local interaction proﬁle fM(s, t).
Therefore, we expect that non-equilibrium mode coupling
will vanish when averaging over an ensemble of ﬁlaments,
such that detailed balance will be recovered, even in an
active system.

The cross-correlations and currents predicted by our

model could, in principle, be tested experimentally.
is not a priori obvious which projections of mode space
will reveal the largest currents, but highly correlated
mode pairs constitute likely candidates. Probing detailed
balance in the conﬁgurational space of probe ﬁlaments
and measuring cycling frequencies will be an ideal, non-
invasive tool to, for example, detect and quantify mo-
tor activity in biological networks, living cells and tis-
sues [8, 9, 12].

APPENDIX - DERIVATION OF THE NET

CYCLING FREQUENCY ωq,w IN THE

WHITE-NOISE REGIME

Consider a stochastic trajectory of the vector of mode
amplitudes (cid:126)a, as deﬁned in the main text (Eq. (8)).
In equilibrium, the system transitions stochastically be-
tween microstates (cid:126)a , obeying detailed balance. In other
words, transitions between any two states (cid:126)a1 (cid:10) (cid:126)a2 oc-
cur at equal rates in both directions. Out of equilib-
rium, however, there may be transitions that occur more
frequently in one , (cid:126)a1 → (cid:126)a2, than in the reverse di-
rection. This imbalance of transitions is quantiﬁed by
the probability current (cid:126)j. In a non-equilibrium steady-
state (NESS), a ﬁnite probability current (cid:126)j (cid:54)= 0 must be
solenoidal, as any other form of the current would vio-
late the steady-state Fokker-Planck equation (cid:126)∇ · (cid:126)j = 0
(Eq. (8) in the main text).

Such a solenoidal probability current thus deﬁnes a
sense of rotation. As an example, consider a two-
dimensional conﬁgurational phase space in polar co-
ordinates (r, θ) in a NESS. Here, angular transitions
∆θ will occur more frequently in, say, the positive
(anti-clockwise) than in the negative (clockwise) direc-
tion Prob(∆θ > 0) > Prob(∆θ < 0). Over time, tra-
jectories will therefore, on average, cycle around the ori-
gin in an anti-clockwise sense at a net cycling frequency
ω = (cid:104) ˙θ(cid:105).

In the following, we derive an expression for ωq,w in a
reduced two-dimensional space of two modes aq and aw,
where all other mode dynamics are integrated out.

We begin by calculating the closed-form solution of the
probability current (cid:126)j((cid:126)a) from the Fokker-Planck equation

((cid:126)a, t) = −(cid:126)∇ · (cid:126)j((cid:126)a, t)

(cid:126)j((cid:126)a, t) = K(cid:126)aρ ((cid:126)a, t) − D(cid:126)∇ρ ((cid:126)a, t) .

Since we are interested in the steady-state, we assume
∂ρ((cid:126)a, t)/∂t = 0 and (cid:126)j((cid:126)a, t) = (cid:126)j((cid:126)a) in Eqs. (S1) and (S2)
respectively. For white noise, the steady state solution of
(cid:126)j((cid:126)a) can be written as [1]

(cid:126)j((cid:126)a) =(cid:0)K + DC−1(cid:1) (cid:126)aρ ((cid:126)a) ≡ Ω(cid:126)aρ ((cid:126)a)

We here concentrate on the origin of the probability cur-
rent, which is the active force term fM(s, t) and therefore
neglect the thermal equilibrium contribution in Eq. (S4)
(a more comprehensive analysis can be found in [2]). Fur-
thermore, we take the white-noise limit of Eq. (S5) for
t = t(cid:48) to obtain the corresponding correlation matrix
C in this limit. To this end, we consider the white-
noise limit of the telegraph process (cid:104)Tn(t)Tm(t(cid:48))(cid:105) → C1 +
C2δn,mτMδ(t−t(cid:48)), where the proportionality constant τM
ensures proper scaling of the active force variance. The
corresponding limit of the coloured-noise mode correla-
tor Eq. (S5) can be obtained by expanding Cq,w(t, t) up
to linear order in τM, which results in

The ﬁrst eigenvalue λ+ gives the net cycling frequency,
which we wish to derive: ωq,w = Im(λ+). We note, that
the second eigenvalue Im(λ−) = −ωq,w would be the cor-
rect frequency, if one exchanged the aq- and aw-axis.

From the deﬁnition of Fq,w = (cid:80)

nyw(sn)yq(sn) it
follows that Fq(cid:54)=w < Fq,q. We expand the frequency
into a power series of the small parameter, the coupling
coeﬃcient Fq,w around 0 and obtain

This frequency can be obtained experimentally, in prin-
ciple, from steady-state data {aq(t), aw(t)}. The average
frequency can be obtained from ωq,w = (cid:104) ˙ϕq,w(cid:105), where
ϕq,w(t) = tan−1 (aw(t)/aq(t)) is the polar angle of aq(t)

and aw(t), such that ωq,w = (cid:104)( ˙awaq − ˙aqaw) /(cid:0)a2
