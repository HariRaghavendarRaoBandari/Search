A hidden variables model for non-relativistic

quantum mechanics in terms of probabilities of

particle paths.

Abstract

Ii is proved that in non-relativistic quantum mechanics (without
spin) the transition probability may be described in terms of parti-
cle paths, every path having a (positive) probability. This leads to
a stochastic hidden variables theory providing an intuitive picture of
particle motion. The change of velocity at every time has a probabil-
ity that depends on the potential over a large region, at a diﬀerence
with the local action of classical dynamics. Thus the hidden vari-
ables theory is non-local. The theory solves some of the diﬃculties of
Bohm’s.

1 Bohm hidden variables

In quantum mechanics the state of a physical system is determined by the
wavefunction (more generally the statevector). However the wavefunction
only allows predicting the probabilities of the possible results of the mea-
surements, which suggests that it does not deﬁne completely the state. Thus
since the early days of quantum mechanics the possibility was considered of
introducing additional parameters in order to deﬁne the state in more detail.
Those parameters have been known as “hidden variables”. The mainstream
of the scientiﬁc community did not support hidden variables, viewed as use-
less or even impossible. The belief was reinforced by the von Neumann

1

theorem of 1932 against hidden variables. However 20 years later David
Bohm[1] proposed a speciﬁc hidden variables model, recovering old ideas of
de Broglie (the particle is guided by a wave) and Madelung (the hydrody-
namical interpretation of Schr¨odinger’s equation). Bohm´s model proved
that hidden variables are indeed possible, which showed that von Neumann
theorem rested upon too restrictive assumptions. The subject was clariﬁed
in two celebrated papers by John Bell[2],[3].

In Bohm’s model every particle has an actual path which is completely
determined by a guiding complex ﬁeld ψ (r, t) once the initial position is
ﬁxed. The ﬁeld ψ may be separated in two real ﬁelds R (r, t) and S (r, t),
that is

ψ = R exp (iS/h) .

(1)

The evolution of the ﬁeld ψ is governed Schr¨odinger´s equation which, taking
eq.(1) into account, becomes two coupled equations that is

(3)

where V (r) is the potential acting on the particle. Born´s postulate is in-
cluded in the model, so that R2 is taken as the probability density of particles
in a statistical ensemble. Hence eq.(2) is a continuity equation of the sta-
tistical ﬂuid, provided we interpret m−1∇S as its local mean velocity, which
leads to the Madelung hydrodynamical analogy of the Schr¨odinger equation.
A hidden variables model is obtained by introducing Bohm’s assumption that
the path, x (t) , of the actual particle is determined by the “guiding” relation

dx (t)

∇S (r,t) |r=x .

(4)

Several authors have developped Bohm´s model in diﬀerent directions[4].
Asides from applications (e. g. description of chemical reactions in terms
of molecular paths) some authors consider that the model provides a good
picture of the quantum behaviour. However there are diﬃculties for that
interpretation, mainly the following:

1) The model is deterministic, that might be a good feature for some
people, but it is unable to explain the probabilistic character of quantum

2

mechanics. Thus one is compelled to introduce Born’s rule as an additional
assumption. The postulate is consistent with eq.(2) , but there is no reason
to use a statistical ensemble when there is a single particle and the motion is
deterministic. Also there is no clue as to why the real part of the ﬁeld should
be the (square root of) the probability density in the ensemble.

2) The particle´s law of motion appears as a modiﬁcation of classical
mechanics by the addition of a kind of force deriving from a “quantum po-
tential” (second term on the right side of eq.(3)). That potential has the
strange feature that the force depends on the gradient of the logaritm of the
ﬁeld R (r, t) , whence it may be large even in regions where the ﬁeld intensity
R is very small.

3) In any stationary state, where the wavefunction ψ may be taken as real
and therefore S = 0, the particle is at rest according to eq.(4). Nevertheless it
is assumed that the position is random with a probability density determined
by the ﬁeld R (r). This looks somewhat inconsistent.

In my opinion these diﬃculties prevent us to consider Bohm´s model as
an appropriate picture for the quantum behaviour. In this paper I propose
a diﬀerent hidden variables model that eliminates the diﬃculties, I hope. It
rests on Feynman’s path integral formulation of quantum mechanics.

2 Transition amplitude in Feynman’s formu-

lation

Feynman´s paths integrals have been very important both from the funda-
mental and from the practical points of view[5]. But obviously the formalism
is not a hidden variables model. Indeed if it is applied to the motion of par-
ticles like atoms it is rather counterintuitive.
Indeed it oﬀers an intuitive
picture for the propagation of ﬁelds, similar to the old Huygens theory of
light, but not for particles. However in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics
of particles without spin (QM in the following) it is possible to get from
Feynman’s formalism an actual path integral approach where every particle
follows a path and there is a positive probability for every possible path.
Presenting that formalism is the purpose of this paper.

QM rests upon Schr¨odinger equation that is, for a single particle,

i

∂ψ
∂t

= ˆHψ ≡(cid:20)−

2

∇2 + V (r)(cid:21) ψ,

(5)

3

∇2 being the Laplacian operator, V (r) the potential and I use units h =
m = 1, a choice that will be made throughout the paper, escept in a few
places for the sake of clarity. The fundamental solution of eq.(5) is obtained
solving it with the initial condition

ψ (r,t0) = δ3 (r − r0) ,

(6)

where δ3 (r − r0) is a three-dimensional Dirac delta. The solution provides a
kernel K (r0,t0 → r,t) , such that the solution at time t with a general initial
condition ψ0(x,t0) may be obtained via

ψ (r,t) =Z dxψ0(x,t0)A (x,t0 → r,t) ,

(7)

where the integral is understood to be 3-dimensional, that is

Z dx ≡Z ∞

−∞

dxZ ∞

−∞

dyZ ∞

dz.

The linear character of eq.(5) allows writing the kernel (or transition ampli-
tude) A for a long time interval, t, as a product of kernels for shorter times
involving integrals at the intermediate points, that is

K (x0,t0 → xn,tn) =Z dxn−1...Z dx1

n

Yj=1

K (xj−1,tj−1 → xj,tj) .

(8)

As the construction is possible for any linear partial diﬀerential equation ﬁrst
order in the time derivative the fundamental solution of any equation of this
type might be writen as a “path integral”.

Feynman[5] showed that an appropriate Kernel (or transition amplitude,

AF ) for Schr¨odinger eq.(5) is the following

AF (xa, ta → xb, tb) = lim

n

2πiε(cid:19)3n/2Z dxn−1...Z dx1
ε→0(cid:18) 1
exp(cid:26) i

where ε ≡ tj − tj−1, is independent of j and x0 ≡ xa, xn ≡ xb. The limit
ε → 0 should be understood with n → ∞ fulﬁlling

nε = tb − ta.

4

(10)

Actually other kernels diﬀerent from AF eq.(9) may be used. They would
diﬀer from Feynman’s by terms of order O (ε) . In this paper I will start using,
instead of eq.(9) , the following one

A = lim

ε→0(cid:18) 1

I omit the proof that is almost identical to the one for KF [5]. Actually
the calculation involves introducing appropriate regularization in the (not
convergent) integrals.

3 Transition probability in terms of particle

paths

In QM the transition probability is the square modulus of the transition
amplitude, that in the path integral formalism becomes,

P (ra, ta → rb, tb) = |A(ra, ta → rb, tb)|2

= Z D(pathpairs) exp(cid:20)iZ tb

(13)

where x0 = y0 = ra, xn = yn = rb, and R D represents a functional integral.

Taking eq.(12) into account the symbolic eq.(13) may be written explicitly

[V (xj) − V (yj)](cid:27) ,

(14)

where R dxj , R dyj are (triple) integrals over the whole space and I have

included the parameters m and h following Feynman[5]. With that choice
the quantity P (a → b) has dimensions of probability per square volume and
it should be interpreted as a relative probability.

Now I want to obtain, from eqs.(14) , a formulation for the motion of a
particle in terms of probabilities (rather than amplitudes!) of paths. If we
take the (continuous) set of paths as discrete, for the sake of clarity, the aim
is to get the transition probability as a sum of probabilities of paths, that is

P (ra, ta → rb, tb) =Xk

Wk(ra, ta → rb, tb),

(15)

where every value of the index k corresponds to a possible path of the particle
with end points (ra, ta) and (rb, tb). Our problem is to ﬁnd positive “weights”
Wk in order to be able to interpret them as probabilities. This would provide
an intuitive picture of the quantum evolution as a motion of particles.

In this section I will study a simple method to get “weights” Wk such
that eq.(15) is fulﬁlled, ignoring for the moment the positivity requirement
of the quantities Wk. I start from eq.(14) and make a change of variables,
that is

rj =

(xj + yj) , uj= (xj−yj)/h, 0 ≤ j ≤ n.

(16)

Hence eq.(14) becomes, reordering the exponentials,

(20)

The quantity sj has the physical meaning of the velocity change at time tj, so
that sj/ε might be interpreted as an acceleration. However the limit of that
quantity for ε → 0 may not exist, that is the instantaneous acceleration is
not well deﬁned. The weight Wk of the path corresponding to the spacetime
points k ≡ {r0, t0; ...rj, tj; ...rn, tn} may be written

Wk(ra, ta → rb, tb) ≡

Yj=1

j (rj, sj) .

(21)

A suﬃcient (although not necessary) condition for the positivity of Wk is that
all quantities Qk
j are positive. However this is not the case in general. In the
next section I will show that some plausible constrains make nonnegative the
weight of every path. If Qj ≥ 0 it has the physical meaning of the probability
that the velocity change is sj at time tj.

For the proof of positivity it is necessary a change leading to a diﬀerent
description of the transition probability, equivalent however to eq.(17) in the
limit ε → 0. I will write

The relevant result is that only the term of order ε in eq.(23) contributes to
eq.(22) in the limit ε → 0. In fact we have

limit when ε → 0 (remember that we assume nε = tb − ta, ﬁnite in the limit).

As the sum Pj Bj consists of n − 1 terms, the quantity εPj Bj has a ﬁnite
Similarly there are n(n − 1)/2 terms in the double sum PlPj>l BlBj so

that its product times ε2 has also a ﬁnite limit. The same happens for every
term in the right side of eq.(24) . In sharp contrast the terms containing Bs
j
in eq.(23) with s > 1 have extra factors ε whence they do not contribute in
the limit ε → 0. For instance there will be n (n − 1) terms of order ε3 not
included in the sum eq.(24) , namely those of the form

The sum of these terms contributes a quantity of order n2ε3 that will go to

The integrals in uj of eq.(22) are not well deﬁned and I will include a

where ˜V (2s) is the Fourier transform of the potential, here deﬁned by

˜V (2s) ≡Z V (x) exp (−2mix · s/h) dx.

It may be realized that Qj has dimensions of probability density in the
velocity space (or momentum space, modulo a factor m−3). Consequently it
is more convenient to write he transition probability eq.(25) in terms of inte-
grals with respect to the “velocity change” variables {sj} deﬁned in eqs.(20).
Getting sj in terms of the variables {rk} is trivial, and obtaining rj in terms
of {sk} plus the end points r0 and rn is straightforward although lengthy.
In the change of variables it is necessary to introduce the Jacobian of the
transformation, that may be got from eqs.(20) giving

3.1 Quantum evolution in terms of positive path prob-

abilities

The transition probability P (a → b), eq.(31) , is positive it being equivalent to
the modulus square of the Feynman amplitude eq.(9). However the functions
Qj are not deﬁnite positive in general. Therefore it is not obvious that the
product

n−1

W ({sj}) ≡

Qj

(32)

is positive, which would be necessary to allow interpreting it as the (rela-
tive) probability of the path consisting of the positions {rj} (or the velocity
changes {sj} related to the positions via eqs.(20)). However a suﬃcient con-
dition for the positivity of Qj may be derived from the following plausible
bounds on the Fourier transform of the potential ˜V , eq.(29) ,

Yj=1

≤ KΘ (S − |sj|) ,

(33)

˜V (rj, sj)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where K is a positive parameter and the Heavside function Θ (x) = 1 if
x ≥ 0, Θ (x) = 0 otherwise. The bounds eq.(33) imply that the potential
V (x) cannot be too big and it cannot have too rapid spatial variations. This
excludes strong “classical forces” (i. e. large gradients of the potential), that
is a plausible physical requirement in a nonrelativistic treatment. Eq.(33)
implies a bound on the function F (rj, sj; γ) , namely

|F (rj, sj; γ)| ≤ (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
Z du exp (−iu · sj)(cid:20)V (rj −
˜V(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where eqs.(27) to (29) have been taken into account. Hence it is possible to
prove the positivity of every Qj as follows. With reference to eq.(26) we have

Qj = (πγ)−3/2 exp −
Qj ≥ (πγ)−3/2 exp −
≥ (πγ)−3/2 exp(cid:18)−

4γ ! − 2π−3εK
4γ(cid:19) − 2π−3εK if |sj| < S.

The latter quantity is positive for given γ provided ε is small enough. There-
fore the weights W ({sj}) , eq.(32) , are nonnegative deﬁnite for any ﬁxed
value of γ > 0, if Qj is deﬁned by eq.(26) and the time interval ε is suﬃ-
ciently small (that is n large enough). Nevertheless we may take the limit
γ → 0 provided this is made after the limit ε → 0. As a conclusion I will
deﬁne the probability of a path by the functional

n−1

W [r(t)] = lim
γ→0

(34)

that is nonnegative for any path. With this deﬁnition the relative probability
W [r(t)] becomes a functional, and the transition probability, eq.(18) , is a
functional integral. This completes the positivity proof.

4 The hidden variables theory

The formalism developped in this paper provides a description of (non-
relativistic) quantum motion more detailed than the standard quantum de-
scription, but in agreement with it when appropriate averages are made. In
particular, sums of probabilities of paths in order to get transition probabil-
ities, see eqs.(31) and (32) . Thus the formalism is a hidden variables theory
(HVT) of quantum mechanics. The HVT is stochastic in the sense that
it does not provide a deterministic law of motion (as for instance Bohm’s
HVT does) but the probability of the diﬀerent possible paths of a quantum
particle. The HVT may be useful for some calculations where we want to
emphasize the particle aspect of (nonrelativistic) quantum systems. Some
care is needed in the comparison of diﬀerent path (relative) probabilities due
to the fact that the normalization must be consistent for all paths.

Calculations from eq.(34) are quite involved, because we should work with
a ﬁnite value of the parameter γ, take the limit ε → 0 for that value, and
only after that we could get the limit γ → 0. In practice we might work in
the limit γ → 0 even before taking the limit ε → 0, that is using for the path
probability W one of the following expressions, either

(36)

In this case there is no guarantee that the quantity W is positive. However
positivity is not excluded because the suﬃcient conditions stated in the pre-
vious section, eq.(33) , are not necessary. The procedure may be also useful
if the ﬁnal result of interest is positive, even if for some paths the weights
are negative.

In particular we may make approximations in powers of the parameter
ε, but being aware that the results at some orders of ε may be negative
(only the exact result needs to be positive). In any case we must be carefull
with the physical interpretation at the intermediate stages of the calculation.
For instance a tentative physical interpretation ot the ﬁrst few terms of an
expansion in the parameter ε is as follows. The term of zeroth order is a
product of Dirac’s deltas which implies that sj = 0 for all j, meaning that
there is some (positive) probability that the velocity never changes, i. e. the
particle travels in a straight line with constant velocity. The ﬁrst order term
is

(37)

that might be interpreted saying that the particle travels with uniform motion
from the initial time ta until time ta + jε, at that time there is a random
change of the velocity, induced by the potential, and the particle travels again
with uniform motion until the ﬁnal time tb.The sum in j takes into account
that the velocity change may be produced at any intermediate time and we
should add the corresponding probabilities. Similarly the term of second

and the interpretation might be that there are two velocity changes in the
time interval (ta, tb) . However those interpretations are misleading because
eqs.(37) and (38) may not be positive and therefore they cannot be inter-
preted as probabilities. The same is true for terms of higher order in ε. Only
the sum of all the terms, W eq.(36) , is positive and this is only guaranteed
if the limit γ → 0 is taken after the limit ε → 0, as shown above.

Asides from the possibility of getting the probabilities of the possible
paths of a quantum particle, there are two possible types of problem that
may be solved with our HVT. We may compare either diﬀerent paths all of
them having the same end points (ra, ta; rb, tb) or diﬀerent paths all of them
with the same initial positions and velocities (ra, va, ta). The initial velocity
may be got from the two initial positions, that is va = (r1 − ra)/ε. The two
mentioned possibilities correspond to the two standard problems of classical
dynamics, namely solving the diﬀerential equations of motion either ﬁxing the
boundary conditions or ﬁxing the initial conditions. In quantum mechanics
the former problem is closer to Feynman’s path integral approach and the
latter to the Schr¨odinger approach. In summary our HVT allows calculating
the probabilities of all possible particle paths, deﬁned by the space-time
points {rj, tj} , j = 0, 1, ...n. Previously we should get the ‘velocity changes’
{sj} using eqs.(20) .

From the HVT we may also calculate relevant quantities that result from
the sum of probabilities of pahts. One of them is the transition probability,
that is the probability that the initial and ﬁnal positions are ra and rb,
respectively, via eq.(31). Indeed this was the starting point for our HVT. It
is also possible to ﬁnd the probability, P (vb) , that the ﬁnal velocity is vb,
at time tb, for a particle that started with a given position, ra, and given

13

velocity, va, at time ta. It may be calculated as follows

P (ra, va; vb) =Z dvn−2Z dvn−3...Z dv1W {sj} .

Here it is understood that the n − 1 velocity changes {sj} are obtained from
the n velocities {vj} via eqs.(20) , where v0 = va, vn−1 = vb. There are also
n + 1 position vectors, but one of them, r0 = ra, appears as arguments of
the desired probability, eq.(39) , another one, rn = rb is not required and the
remaining n − 1 may be got from ra plus the velocities via the eqs.(??) . An
application of eq.(39) will be the derivation of Born approximation for scat-
tering to be made in the next section. There are other possible applications
like calculation the probability of a ﬁnal position when we know the initial
position and velocity of the particle, or the ﬁnal velocity when we know the
initial and ﬁnal positions. I shall not discuss these possibilities here.

5 A few illustrative examples

5.1 Classical limit

In this case there is no problem of positivity and we may start with γ = 0.
Thus it is more convenient to use eq.(35). In the limit h → 0 we get

W =

δ(cid:18) rj−1−2rj+rj+1

ε

+

ε
m

▽ · V (rj)(cid:19) ,

(40)

n−1

Xj=1

where the argument of the three-dimensional Dirac’s deltas leads to Newton’s
second law in the limit ε → 0. In particular if the potential is a constant
eq.(40) shows that the motion is inertial, i. e. with constant velocity.

5.2 Quadratic potentials

When the potential is quadratic our HVT gives a single path with probability
one, that is the classical path. For instance, let us assume the potential

V = A · r + Br2.

14

Then the latter exponential in eq.(35) becomes

exp(cid:26)iε

h (cid:20)V (rj −

= exp {−iε (A · uj+2Brj·uj)} ,

h
2

uj) − V (rj +

h
2

uj)(cid:21)(cid:27)

whence eq.(35) gives, after performing the uj integrals, again the classical
eq.(40) . This might provide an explanation as to why the quantum harmonic
oscillator has a behaviour sometimes resembling the classical motion (e.g. in
the coherent states).

5.3 Born approximation for scattering

The Born approximation for scattering is one of the most useful applications
of non-relativistic quantum mechanics. In the following I will rederive Born´s
formula from the HVT above proposed. Obvioulsy the purpose is not to
make a new derivation of the formula, but to ilustrate our HVT. Thus I shall
carefully discuss the approximations involved.

We consider a scattering experiment described as follows. There are three
regions, namely the source, the target and the detector, separated by macro-
scopic distances from each other. A particle moves freely (see eq.(40)) ex-
cept in the target region where the potential, V (r), is diﬀerent from zero.
We assume that the particle leaves the source with a velocity, va, say in the
direction of the Z axis, that is va = (0, 0, va). In the travel to the target
it does not change velocity (the potential is zero there), but I will assume
the existence of small uncertainties in the velocity making that the position
becomes uncertain by an amount large in comparison with the size of the
target. This is plausible taking into account that the macroscopic distance
source-target is extremely large in comparison with the dimensions of the
target. Thus it is plausible that the position at the arrival just before the
target region, say at time ta = 0, is uncertain, a fact that I will represent
by an uniform probability per unit volume, ρ, within a slab with surfaces
parallel to the XY plane. An alternative picture is to consider an ensem-
ble of particles, every particle having a well deﬁned velocity va, ρ being the
density of particles in the ensemble before the arrival at the target. In prac-
tice both assumptions are equivalent, but as an illustration of our HVT the
former is better. Once in the target region the particle suﬀers accelerations
by the action of the potential, ﬁnally leaving the region and arriving at the

15

detector with velocity vb at time tb. The particle may follow diﬀerent paths,
the probability of every one given by the quantity W of eq.(36) . Actually
W is a probability density in the space of 3n − 3 dimensions of the variables
{sj} , but we are interested in the probability density, P (vb) , eq.(39) ,within
the ﬁnal velocity space of 3 dimensions.

The quantity of interest is the diﬀerential cross section, σ (θ, φ), deﬁned

by

σ (θ, φ) =

R (θ, φ)

Φin

=

R (θ, φ)

ρva

,

(41)

where Φin = ρva is the incoming probability ﬂux in our model. R (θ, φ) is the
probability per unit time that the particle leaves the target with a velocity
vector pointing in a given solid angle. It may be got from P (vb) as follows

R (θ, φ) =Z v2

b dvbZ ∞

−∞

dxZ ∞

−∞

dyρvaP (vb) ,

(42)

where ρva is the incoming probability ﬂux in the target. The integral of
that ﬂux times P (vb) gives the total probability per unit time that the
particle leaves the target region with velocity vb. The integral in dvb takes
into account that only the direction of the ﬁnal velocity matters for our
calculation.

I will perform the calculation up to second order in the parameter ε. To
zeroth order W is a product of Dirac’s deltas (see eq.(40)) whence eq.(39)
leads to

P0 (vb) = δ(vb − va).

(43)

The relevant consequence is that the probability P0 does not contribute to
the quantity of interest for us, that is the cross section for θ 6= 0.

The ﬁrst order contribution should be calculated using eqs.(39) and (37) .
There are n − 2 Dirac deltas, so that after integrating with respect to all
n − 2 velocities {vj} , see eq.(39) , we get

P1 (vb) = 2π−3ε

n−1

Xk=1

Imn ˜V (2vb − 2va) exp [−2irk· (vb − va)]o .

The motion until time εk is uniform with va, whence the position vector rk
is given by

rk = ra + vaεk ≡ ra + vat.

16

The sum in k may be calculated in the continuous time limit that corresponds
to the limit ε → 0. We shall write ε → dt, and substitute and integral in t
for the sum in j. We get

P1 (vb) = 2π−3 Im(cid:26) ˜V (0)Z tb

ta

dt(cid:27)

= 2π−3 (tb − ta) Im ˜V (0) = 0,

the latter equality coming from the fact that ˜V (0) is real (see eq.(29) . There-
fore the term of ﬁrst order in ε does not contribute.

To get the second order term we shall use eqs.(39) and (38) . In this case
there are n − 3 Dirac deltas and n − 2 integrals with respect to the velocities
{vj} . Taking into account the deltas, we realize that the particle moves with
velocity va from time ta to time εk = t′, where it changes to velocity v, then
that velocity until time εj = t, where it changes to velocity vb and with this
velocity until time tb. Therefore we have

rj = rk + vt, rk = ra+vat′, sk = v − va, sj = vb−v.

(44)

After integrating the deltas it remains the integral with respect to a single
velocity v. There are two terms in P2 (vb) that may be written taking into
account the following equality (with aj complex and bj real)

Im [a1 exp (ib1))] Im [a2 exp (ib2))]

2 exp [i (b1 − b2)]}

Re {a1a∗

Re {a1a2 exp [i (b1 + b2)]} .

(45)

I will label P21 and P22 these terms. The former may be written, in the
continuous time limit,

P21 = 2π−6Z tb

dtZ t

dt′Z dv Re I,

I ≡ ˜V ∗ (2vb − 2v) ˜V (2v − 2va) exp {2i [(ra + vat′)· (v − va)]} (46)

× exp {−2i [(ra + vat′+v(t − t′)) · (vb − v)]} .

Hence, taking eq.(42) into account we get

The times ta and tb may be assumed to correspond to the particle being
near the source and near the detector, respectively, therefore we may take
ta → −∞, tb → ∞. Then the integrals with respect to dt′ and dt lead to

dt′ exp {2it′ [va· (v − va) − (va − v) · (vb − v)]}

after integrating with respect to dv we have

that is Born’s formula. I stress that in our calculation the conservation of
energy, that is |vb| = |va| , appears explicitly in eq.(48) .

The calculation of the term P22(vb) is similar to the one of P21(vb) eq.(46) ,
but I skip the details. The main diﬀerence being that δ3 (vb − va) is substi-
tuted for δ3 (2v − va − vb) , eq.(??) . This implies that the velocity does not
change in the scattering process and therefore the term does not contribute
to the desired cross section.

In conclusion the result of our HVT calculation is the same as the stan-
dard one of quantum mechanics, as should be expected. But in the HVT cal-
culation we deal only with particles rather than waves as the QM derivation
of the Born formula suggests. The picture that emerges from the calculation
is as follows. Every single particle, that travels from source to the detector
crossing the target region, may have many diﬀerent paths. We calculate the
weight for every possible path and we select those paths that ﬁnish with a
desired velocity. We sum the weights of all those paths and interpret the
sum as a probability, whence the calculation of the scattering cross section is
straightforward. As shwown in section 3 the weight of every path is positive
and it may be interpreted as a probability. However we make an approxima-
tion for the calculation of the total probability, that still appears as a sum of
weights of paths, but in the approximate calculation the weight of every path
may no longer be positive, and therefore it could not be interpreted as a path
probability. Furthermore the approximation method selects a small fraction
of the possible paths, namely those that suﬀer 0, 1 or 2 changes of velocity
(corresponding to the calculations to order 1, ε or ε2, respectively). The ap-
proximation involves the action of the potential only 0, 1 or 2 times only and
therefore it is valid for weak potentials. (The validity of Born approximation
in the QM calculation is discussed in most textbooks). In summary, we start
with a clear physical picture and devise a mathematical procedure for the
calculation within that picture. Then we make approximations in the math-
ematical procedure, but the price is that the physical picture is lost at the
intermediate steps. Finally we arrive at a sensible result involving positive
probabilities.

5.4 “Interference” experiment

Born’s approximation, eq.(49) allows a simple calculation of the result of
interference experiments. For instance let us consider the potential

V (r) = C(cid:8)exp(cid:2)−λ (r + a)2(cid:3) + exp(cid:2)−λ (r − a)2(cid:3)(cid:9) , a ≡ (a, 0, 0) ,

and a particle with initial velocity v0 = (0, 0, v0) , that is moving in the Z
direction. Obtaining the cross section via Born’s approximation is a trivial
exercize in quantum mechanics. We get

(50)

σ = C 2 π

λ3 exp(cid:20)−

v2 + v2

0 − 2v0vz
2λ

(cid:21) cos2 (avx) ,

where v = (vx, vy, vz) is the ﬁnal velocity. Hence the cross section becomes,
taking the conservation of energy, eq.(??) , into account,

σ = C 2 π

λ3 exp(cid:20)−

2v2

0 sin2 θ

λ

(cid:21) cos2 (av0 sin θ cos φ) .

(51)

Assuming that the particles are detected by the spots produced in a screen
parallel to the XY plane we would observe typical interference fringes with
a decreasing intensity in both directions X and Y with a maximum at x =
y = 0.

The point of this calculation is that no waves are involved, only particles.
Therefore in our HVT the interference picture is an eﬀect of the non-local
action of the potential. Of course we might assume that the action is mediated
by some “hidden” waves that do interfere, but this hypothesis is not an
essential part of our HVT.

6 Conclusions

I have proved that in non-relativistic quantum mechanics (without spin) it is
possible to picture the transition probability in terms of particle paths, every
path having a (positive) probability. A path may be deﬁned by the positions
{ra ≡ r0, ...rj, ...rb ≡ rn} at times ta,...tj ≡ ta + jε, ...tb or, what is equivalent,
the end positions plus the velocity changes {sj} at times tj. Eventually we
should consider the limit n → ∞ with nε = tb −ta. This provides a stochastic
(non-local) hidden variables theory where particles travel along continuous
paths.

20

The quantity W, eq.(37) , has been deﬁned for the calculation of the prob-
abilities of the possible paths that start at the space-time point (ra, ta) and
ﬁnish at (rb, tb) . However our HVT may be used for another relevant prob-
lem, namely the calculation of the probability of the diﬀerent paths starting
at a given point with a given velocity, that is (ra, va, ta) . Hence we might
study a kind of “evolution in phase space”, something that quantum me-
chanics does not provide. But I shall point out that such evolution is quite
diﬀerent from a classical evolution because here the acceleration is not well
deﬁned (the paths are represented by functions r (t) that are not diﬀeren-
tiable in general). Our hidden variables theory provides information going
beyond quantum mechanics. Whether some of the possible additional pre-
dictions may be tested empirically will not be discussed in this paper. In any
case no contradiction with quantum mechanics is expected.

Is summary our stochastic hidden variables model gives an intuitive pic-
ture of non-relativistic quantum mechanics (without spin) in terms of prob-
abilities of the possible paths of particles. The particle´s motion is repre-
sented by a stochastic process such that there is a random change of velocity
at every time tj, with a probability depending on the potential over a large
region around the position of the particle (indeed it derives from the Fourier
transform of the potential, see eq.(29)). In this sense our HVT is non-local.
The wave behaviour, e. g.
in experiments of atom interference, may be
interpreted assuming that the motion of the particles is governed by a law
(diﬀerent from Newton´s) where the “acceleration” depends on the potential
on a whole spatial region, at a diﬀerence with the local action of classical dy-
namics. With this interpretation the interference experiments with particles,
e. g. atoms, may be explained without assuming that those particles possess
any wave nature or that they may cross two distant slits at the same time.
But I stress again that we remain at the level of non-relativistic quantum
mechanics. I do not claim that a similar interpretation may be extended to
relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory, e. g. photons, electrons when spin plays a
role, or even atoms or molecules when (Bose or Fermi) statistics is relevant.
We have dealt with a single particle, but the generalization to N inter-
acting particles is straightforward, except for the possible eﬀects of quantum
statistics.
