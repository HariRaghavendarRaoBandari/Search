In the Comment to my paper [1], von Neumann-Cosel
suggests that the low-energy contribution to σ−2 caused
by the pygmy dipole resonance (PDR) should provide
a systematic upward correction of the order of 5-10%.
The author additionally performs a free ﬁt to σ−2 data
from polarizability (120Sn [2] and 208Pb [3]), photoneu-
tron cross section (68Ni [4, 5]), and total nuclear photoab-
sorption (12C, 16O, 27Al and 40Ca [6]) studies. Diﬀerent
volume, Sv, and surface-to-volume, Ss/Sv, coeﬃcients of
the symmetry energy to the ones given by Tian and col-
laborators [7] are extracted. According to von Neumann-
Cosel, the coeﬃcients from the free ﬁt “may be better
suited”.

I agree with the author that, because of the low-energy
PDR contribution, a systematic upward correction to σ−2
can be expected in nuclei with neutron excess considering
the E−2
γ weighting of σ−2 . However, it is premature to
claim a general PDR contribution to σ−2 based on four
measurements only (inelastic proton scattering at rela-
tivistic energies of 120Sn [2], 208Pb [3] and 90Zr [8], and
a selected photon scattering measurement in 138Ba [9]).
Moreover, the author provides estimates for only two
measurements (120Sn and 208Pb). Additional measure-
ments of the PDR contribution for a broader range of
nuclei with neutron excess are clearly needed to deduce
a systematic eﬀect.

Furthermore, I see several arguments against the sym-
metry energy parameters extracted by von Neumann-
Cosel.

1) The author uses the nuclear photoabsorption data
from ﬁve nuclei (12C, 16O, 27Al, 40Ca [6, 10] and
68Ni [4, 5]) to perform a free ﬁt to the Sv and Ss/Sv
variables in Eq.[12] of my paper [1]. He claims that
his resulting parameters “may be better suited” to the
σ−2 trend partly because four data points (12C, 16O,
27Al, 40Ca [6, 10]) include both photoproton and pho-
toneutron cross sections above 10 MeV. These four data
points are derived from a single total nuclear photoab-
sorption study by Ahrens and co-workers in 1975, which
used bremsstrahlung photon beams. As pointed out by
Bergere [11], care must be taken concerning this method,
because it has the drawback of large non-nuclear contri-
butions (e.g., Compton scattering, pair production, dead

times) which are several tens of times larger than the
total nuclear photoabsorption cross section [11]. Monte-
Carlo simulations should be conducted to calculate the
error for each non-nuclear contribution. Such simulations
are not evident in Ref. [6]. Therefore, the less than 0.1%
error from non-nuclear eﬀects claimed by Ahrens and col-
laborators is questionable. Moreover, if these measure-
ments were as powerful and precise, one can only wonder
why they were not veriﬁed and applied for the photon
energy range of interest to σ−2 since.

In addition, the 68Ni data point [4, 5] in Fig. 1 of the
Comment only includes (γ, n) and (γ, 2n) photoneutron
cross sections and does not account for other neutron de-
cay channels and photoproton contributions. More rele-
vantly, most of the existing information on photoabsorp-
tion cross sections arise from stable nuclei, i.e., we know
very little on how unbound nuclei polarize. Hence, the
68Ni data point should not be included in the free ﬁt.

2) In Ref. [1], I used two independent methods to de-
rive σ−2 : 1) from a ﬁt to the extensive photoneutron
compilation published in 1988 [12], which includes data
from the preferred method of monochromatic photon
beams generated by in-ﬂight annihilation of positrons1,
and shows overall agreement and consistency between
measurements done at Livermore, Giessen, Saclay and
other laboratories, and 2) from the mass dependence of
the symmetry energy extracted from a global ﬁt to the
binding energies of isobaric nuclei with A ≥ 10 [7] given
by the 2012 mass evaluation [13]. These two predicted
trends smoothly converge with the σ−2 data [12] above
A & 70, in agreement with the dominant photoneutron
cross sections for heavy nuclei. No consistency in the pho-
toneutron data is observed for lighter nuclei, which high-
lights the necessity for systematic studies of photoproton
cross sections for A . 70 nuclei. This should, prefer-
ably, be done in direct and simultaneous measurements
of the partial photoneutron and photoproton cross sec-
tions, crucial to obtain reliable total photonuclear cross
sections, as described in Ref. [14].

symmetry energy parameters discussed in this work. Von

1One main advantage of this technique over bremsstrahlung photon
beams is the direct and simultaneous measurements of the partial
photoneutron cross sections which are in competition in the GDR
region.

FIG. 1. (Color online) σ−2 plots for diﬀerent sets of (Sv, Ss/Sv) symmetry-energy parameters discussed in this work. The σ−2
data vs A on a log-log scale from the 1988 photo-neutron cross-section evaluation (circles) [12] and from data provided in the
Comment (squares) are shown for comparison. From the data presented in Fig. [1] of the Comment, the 68Ni data point has
been removed (see text for explanation) and the 40Ca data point has not been lowered from Ref. [6].

Neumann-Cosel shows that, when omitting the 12C data
point, his analysis provides a better ﬁt to the available
data with symmetry-energy parameters (Sv = 25.6(8)
MeV, Ss/Sv = 1.66(5)) similar to those calculated in
Ref. [15] (Sv = 27.3 MeV, Ss/Sv = 1.68). One should at
least mention the drawback of these theoretical param-
eters which include the Coulomb interaction of protons
but do not imply a neutron skin, later precisely mea-
sured in 208Pb by Tamii and collaborators [3]. Consid-
ering a neutron skin has a dramatic eﬀect on the calcu-
lated surface-to-volume ratio (Sv = 24.1 MeV, Ss/Sv =
0.545) [15]. It is true that the latter parameters fail to de-
scribe the σ−2 data for light nuclei, but it seems to work
where it is intended to, i.e., for heavy nuclei, where the
excess neutrons can form a skin against a N ≈ Z core.
In fact, the calculated σ−2 trend implying a neutron skin
(Sv = 24.1 MeV, Ss/Sv = 0.545) also converges with the
photoneutron data [12] and with Eq.
[14] (Sv = 28.32
MeV, Ss/Sv = 1.27) in Ref. [1] for A & 70, as clearly
shown in the inset of Fig. 1.

In conclusion, I agree with the relevance of the PDR
contribution at low energies [12], a contribution that
remains to be quantiﬁed for many heavy nuclei with
neutron excess, but disagree with the statement that
the diﬀerent volume and surface-to-volume coeﬃcients
of the symmetry energy extracted from a free ﬁt in von
Neunman-Cosel’s Comment are better suited than the
ones chosen in my paper [7]. The fact of the matter is

that additional data are vital to pin down the mass de-
pendence of σ−2 and the symmetry energy, especially for
nuclei below A ≈ 70. The author acknowledges funding
