ABSTRACT

We present the ﬁrst observations of quiescent active regions (ARs) using NuSTAR, a focusing hard X-
ray telescope capable of studying faint solar emission from high temperature and non-thermal sources.
We analyze the ﬁrst directly imaged and spectrally resolved X-rays above 2 keV from non-ﬂaring ARs,
observed near the west limb on 2014 November 1. The NuSTAR X-ray images match bright features
seen in extreme ultraviolet and soft X-rays. The NuSTAR imaging spectroscopy is consistent with
isothermal emission of temperatures 3.1 − 4.4 MK and emission measures 1 − 8 × 1046 cm−3. We do
not observe emission above 5 MK but our short eﬀective exposure times restrict the spectral dynamic
range. With few counts above 6 keV, we can place constraints on the presence of an additional hotter
component between 5 and 12 MK of ∼ 1046cm−3 and ∼ 1043 cm−3, respectively, at least an order
of magnitude stricter than previous limits. With longer duration observations and a weakening solar
cycle (resulting in an increased livetime), future NuSTAR observations will have sensitivity to a wider
range of temperatures as well as possible non-thermal emission.

INTRODUCTION

The detailed process by which energy is released in the
Sun’s atmosphere remains poorly understood. In active
regions (ARs), the heating of material and acceleration
of particles occur impulsively in ﬂares, but even when
there appear to be no ﬂares, ARs still contain loops of
material heated to several million Kelvin. One proposed
solution is to have episodic heating, with events frequent
enough to smooth out the time series (e.g. Glencross
1975). Parker (1988) described this explanation in mag-
netohydrodynamic terms as the natural development of

small current sheets in magnetic ﬂux tubes that appear
as coronal loops, and coined the term “nanoﬂare” to rep-
resent the idea, estimating that an individual event might
contain ∼ 10−9 the energy of a major ﬂare. This coronal
energy release would be driven by the movement of the
magnetic loops’ footpoints. These need to be suﬃciently
slow (longer than the Alfv´en time for wave propagation)
otherwise waves would dominate and be an alternative
heating mechanism (e.g. Klimchuk 2006; Reale 2014).

The nanoﬂare conjecture implies that the plasma tem-
perature temporarily, and locally, will exceed the mean
(Sturrock et al. 1990; Cargill 1994, 2014; Reale 2014).
Individual nanoﬂares are likely to be so small that they
will be diﬃcult to detect, but their presence should be
observable through the impact of an unresolved ensem-
ble. The spectrum would contain a range of temperatures
reﬂecting an assortment of nanoﬂares at diﬀerent ener-
gies and stages of their energy redistribution. Extreme
ultraviolet (EUV) observations with SDO/AIA and Hin-
ode/EIS of non-ﬂaring ARs typically show a Diﬀerential
Emission Measure (DEM) peaked about 3 MK, steeply
falling oﬀ to higher and lower temperatures (e.g. War-
ren et al. 2011, 2012; Del Zanna et al. 2015). The slope
of the DEM is well studied over 1 − 3 MK due to the
number of EUV lines observable from quiescent regions,
giving scalings of EM ≈ T 3−5. This is consistent with
high-frequency events, where the time between impulsive
heatings is shorter than the cooling timescale (Cargill &
Klimchuk 2004; Reale 2014). The higher temperature
(>5 MK) slope has considerably larger uncertainties, due
to weaker EUV diagnostics.
It appears to be steeper,
with EM ≈ T −(6−10) (Warren et al. 2012). Observed
lines include Fe XVIII (SUMER; Teriaca et al. 2012) and
Fe XIX (EUNIS; Brosius et al. 2014), with peak forma-
tion temperatures of 7.1 MK and 8.9 MK respectively.

and the GOES 1-8 ˚A ﬂux (bottom). (Right) NuSTAR image 2 − 78 keV of the four limb pointings combined together, relative to Sun
center. The ‘x’ indicates the 22:18UT microﬂare.
SDO/AIA 94˚A can also be used to access Fe XVIII (Reale
et al. 2011; Warren et al. 2011; Testa & Reale 2012; War-
ren et al. 2012; Del Zanna 2013).

The hottest material would produce X-ray emission
but is diﬃcult to detect given the expected weak sig-
nal and instruments designed for brighter ﬂares. Hin-
ode/XRT has been used with Hinode/EIS (Testa et al.
2011) and RHESSI (Schmelz et al. 2009; Reale et al.
2009) to constrain the high temperature component. X-
ray spectrometers are required to robustly diagnose this
hottest emission but there have been few instruments ca-
pable of quiescent AR observations: a Bragg crystal on
a Skylark sounding rocket (Parkinson 1975) and SMM’s
Flat Crystal Spectrometer (FCS) (Schmelz et al. 1996;
Del Zanna & Mason 2014). These show weak emis-
sion from lines with peak formation temperatures up
to 10 MK but emission mainly over 3-5 MK, with very
steeply falling DEMs above 5 MK (Del Zanna & Mason
2014). Observations above 2 keV typically have poorer
spectral resolution but the bremsstrahlung continuum
dominates. Temperature diagnostics from the contin-
uum have the advantage of being insensitive to non-
equilibrium ionization that can aﬀect line measurements
(e.g. Bradshaw & Mason 2003). Full-disc observations
of various “non-ﬂaring” ARs have found higher tempera-
tures of up to 11 MK with a SDO/EVE sounding rocket’s
X123 (Caspi et al. 2015), 6.6 MK with CORONAS-
Photon/SphinX (Miceli et al. 2012) and 6-8 MK with
RHESSI (McTiernan 2009).

If nanoﬂares are just energetically smaller versions of
ﬂares/microﬂares then they should also release stored
magnetic energy in the form of accelerated electrons, as
even the smallest microﬂares (GOES A,B-Class ﬂares)
show hard X-ray (HXR) emission (Lin et al. 1984;
Hannah et al. 2008). Similar physics seems possible
given that ﬂare energies appear to behave as a power-
law frequency distribution (e.g. Hannah et al. 2011),
with the occurrence increasing with decreasing magni-

tude. Accelerated electrons are detectable in ﬂares via
their bremsstrahlung emission at higher X-ray energies
(>10 keV) but for quiescent periods these signatures have
remained elusive. RHESSI has been proliﬁc at observ-
ing ﬂare/microﬂare HXRs but struggles with quiescent
emission due to its indirect imaging and high non-solar
background. Only high-temperature emission was found
for quiescent ARs using RHESSI (McTiernan 2009) and
3-200 keV upper limits for the quiet Sun (Hannah et al.
2007, 2010). The FOXSI sounding rocket has higher X-
ray sensitivity and direct imaging and has brieﬂy ob-
served the Sun twice.
It was able to constrain the
high temperature emission from a non-ﬂaring AR but
has not detected anything non-thermal (Krucker et al.
2014; Ishikawa et al. 2014). The presence of accelerated
electrons has been suggested from IRIS ultraviolet ob-
servation (Testa et al. 2014), as the rapid variability of
intensities and velocities at hot coronal loop footpoints
are consistent with simulations of heating by accelerated
electron beams. However X-ray observations are needed
to deﬁnitively detect non-thermal emission.

In this paper we present the ﬁrst directly imaged and
spectrally resolved X-rays above 2 keV from quiescent
ARs using the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array
(NuSTAR; Harrison et al. 2013). NuSTAR is the ﬁrst
focusing optics telescope that covers the HXR bandpass
(2.5-78 keV) and has a higher sensitivity than RHESSI
(Lin et al. 2002), with an eﬀective area 20× larger at
10 keV and lower background. NuSTAR provides a
unique X-ray view of the Sun but is not an optimized so-
lar telescope. The solar pointings therefore present chal-
lenges, especially to use NuSTAR’s full sensitivity. We
brieﬂy discuss this in §2 and a full discussion is available
in Grefenstette et al. (2016). In §3 we present NuSTAR
X-ray images and spectroscopy of several ARs observed
on 2014 November 1, showing detection of emission at
3.1 − 4.4 MK. We determine constraints to the emission
above 5 MK, which are an order of magnitude more re-

strictive than previous observations, in §4.

2. NUSTAR SOLAR OBSERVATIONS

NuSTAR carries two identical co-aligned mirror mod-
ules that focus onto two focal-plane modules (FPMA,
FPMB). Each has a 12(cid:48) × 12(cid:48) ﬁeld of view (FoV) and
FWHM of ∼18(cid:48)(cid:48) (Madsen et al. 2015). The focal-plane
modules are 2 × 2 arrays of CdZnTe detectors each with
32×32 pixels operated in a photon-counting mode. It has
a useable energy-range of 2.5-78 keV with a resolution of
∼ 0.4 keV FWHM below 20 keV. The eﬀective area is
well calibrated down to 3 keV, with only small deviations
to 2.5 keV, becoming substantial at lower energies due
to trigger threshold uncertainty (see Grefenstette et al.
2016). The readout time per event of 2.5 ms gives a
maximum throughput of 400 counts sec−1 per module.
The data are processed using the NuSTAR Data Analysis
software v1.5.1 and NuSTAR CALDB 2015041415, gen-
erating an event list from which images/spectra are cre-
ated. To reduce the eﬀects of pile-up – multiple low en-
ergy photons being recorded as a single high energy count
(e.g. Datlowe 1975) – we restrict our analysis to single-
pixel (“Grade 0”) events (Grefenstette et al. 2016). NuS-
TAR’s optics are such that objects outside the FoV can
add to the detected background via photons that reﬂect
only once, instead of twice for properly focused photons,
allowing them to reach the focal plane as “ghost rays”
(Madsen et al. 2015). These have a well-characterised
shape and behaviour. Without detailed knowledge of
the brightness and variability of the ghost ray sources, no

corrections are possible. Optimal NuSTAR solar obser-
vations therefore require weak sources outside the target
region.

The data in this paper are from the ﬁrst solar science
campaign on 2014 November 1 (Grefenstette et al. 2016),
consisting of four orbits of observations (each about an
hour). We present the analysis of the fourth orbit as it
provides the most stable view of ARs near the west limb
and has the highest livetime, with eﬀective exposures of
about 3 and 11 seconds.

3. NUSTAR QUIESCENT ARS

3.1. Time Proﬁle and Image Mosaic

Figure 1 shows the fourth orbit observations starting
21:34 UT 2014 November 1, which consists of four point-
ings (P1, P2, P3, and P4) going from solar W to N. For
the majority of this orbit the solar position was found by
a single combination of star trackers, or Camera Head
Units (CHUs; Walton et al. 2016). A given CHU com-
bination is accurate to <1.5(cid:48) (Grefenstette et al. 2016)
and varies with the pointing. The NuSTAR images from
P1 and P2 are individually shifted to match the AR lo-
cations from the EUV/SXR images (see Figure 2). As
there are no clear features in P3, the P2 shift was used.
For P4 there are no sources and it is a diﬀerent CHU
combination, so data from the previous orbit during the
same combination, while observing the ARs, were used
for co-alignment.

The time series in Figure 1 compares the NuSTAR
livetime percentage (averaged over FPMA and FPMB,
individually similar) with the RHESSI and GOES obser-
vations. The NuSTAR livetime is very low (about 0.4%)

and near constant during P1, which is due to the quies-
cent ARs. These regions can be seen in the 2 − 78 keV
image in Figure 1, from FPMA and FPMB combined.
In P2, the livetime increases due to fewer ARs in the
FoV and increases further in P3 and P4 once there are
no ARs in the FoV. In these pointings the background
(blue-green in Figure 1) is ghost rays from ARs on the
disk (the imaged limb ones and those elsewhere on the
disk). The cross shape, most evident in P4, is from the
gap between the detector quadrants. During P4 a small
microﬂare occured outside NuSTAR’s FoV, detected by
GOES and RHESSI, appearing as a dip in the NuSTAR
livetime due to the increase in ghost rays. During the
times when NuSTAR was directly imaging the limb ARs,
the full disc GOES ﬂux was ∼ 4 × 10−7 Wm−2, mostly
coming from ARs outside NuSTAR’s FoV. These ghost
rays are about 100× weaker than the directly imaged
ARs (see Grefenstette et al. 2016) and so will have a
negligible contribution.

3.2. X-ray and EUV Image Comparison

Combining the P1 and P2 data we produce 2-4 keV and
4-6 keV livetime-corrected images (with ∼7(cid:48)(cid:48) Gaussian
smoothing), and compare these to SDO/AIA EUV and
GOES/SXI soft X-ray (SXR) images (Figure 2). The
regions in EUV/SXR show little variability during the
NuSTAR observation time, and those shown are averaged
over that period.

In the NuSTAR 2-4 keV image there are ﬁve distinct
regions which match features in the EUV/SXR images.
They correspond to (and we label as) NOAA AR12195
(D1), AR12196 (D2), and above-the-limb sources (L1),
highly occulted AR12192 (L2) and AR12194 (L3). The
major region AR12192 produced several X-class ﬂares
when on the disk and contained expansive coronal loops,
still visible above the limb in EUV/SXR. SDO/AIA
94˚A’s temperature response contains cooler (0.5-1 MK)
and hotter (3-10 MK) components (Testa et al. 2012;
Boerner et al. 2014). So for comparison to the NuS-

TAR images we isolate the emission above 3 MK, from
Fe XVIII (Warren et al. 2011; Del Zanna 2013) (bot-
tom right Figure 2). These show that the hottest emis-
sion is from more compact regions, the brightest from
L2 and L3. This agrees with the NuSTAR 4-6 keV im-
age, which only shows discernible emission from these
locations. We also show the diﬀerential hardness ratio
(I46 − I24)/(I46 + I24) of the 4-6 keV (I46) to 2-4 keV
(I24) emission, ﬁnding the highest spectral hardness in
L2 and L3.

3.3. X-ray Imaging Spectroscopy

For each AR we accumulate the NuSTAR spectrum
over a 120(cid:48)(cid:48) × 120(cid:48)(cid:48) region (Figures 3 and 4). This is
done separately for P1, P2 and FPMA, FPMB as the
instrument response is diﬀerent for each. These spec-
tra are binned with 0.2 keV resolution and only include
Grade 0 (single-pixel hit, minimizing pile-up) events, in
the dominant CHU combination. To forward-ﬁt a model
to this data using SolarSoft/OSPEX16 we need a spectral
response matrix (SRM) for each region, generated from
the Redistribution Matrix and Ancillary Response Files
(RMF, ARF) produced by the NuSTAR Data Analysis
Software17.

Figure 3 and 4 shows forward-ﬁts of CHIANTI 7.1
(Dere et al. 1997; Landi et al. 2013) isothermal models to
each NuSTAR spectrum. We ﬁt from 2.5 keV (the min-
imum useable energy) to the highest energy with ∼ 10
counts per bin, so that the uncertainties are Gaussian
(as OSPEX uses the chi-square test). These isothermal
models ﬁt the data well, with the few excess counts at
higher energies consistent within Poisson statistics. Sim-
ilar temperatures and emission measures are achieved for
each region in FPMA and FPMB except for D2 (top right
Figure 3). Here the FPMB spectrum is from the detec-
tor edge, where the ARF is poorly calibrated (Madsen
et al. 2015) and there might be missing counts. The re-
gions observed in both P1 and P2 show similar values
for each ﬁt, within the relative calibration (Grefenstette
et al. 2016). The P2 values are more robust as the re-
gions are closer to the imaging axis and observed with a
higher eﬀective exposure (about 11 s instead of 3 s).

We can compare the NuSTAR isothermal ﬁts to the
SDO/AIA observations of the regions by folding them
through the 94˚A temperature response (Boerner et al.
2014). We ﬁnd that the NuSTAR ﬁts reproduces
3-17% of the observed 94˚A ﬂux and 10-82% of the
94˚A Fe XVIII ﬂux, consistent with NuSTAR only observ-
ing part of the multi-thermal emission seen by SDO/AIA.
This is due to the weak response of NuSTAR to cooler
temperatures and the short eﬀective exposure times (lim-
iting the dynamic range of the spectra at higher en-
ergies). To improve our sensitivity to a faint high-
temperature (or non-thermal) component we could in-
crease our exposure by observing for longer (more than
790s) and/or during times of weaker solar activity (and
hence achieve livetimes larger than 0.4% and 1.6%).

perature (>5 MK) or non-thermal emission, but we can

on the possible high temperature constraints as we know
that hot plasma could be present (from EUV/SXR ob-
servations) and would have to be accounted for before
non-thermal constraints are attempted.

We determine the upper limits on the emission of an
additional hotter component for all regions using FPMA
(which has a slightly higher livetime) and P1 for D2, L2
and L3 and P2 for D1 and L1. A Monte Carlo approach
is used with the livetime and SRM of each region to gen-
erate a synthetic NuSTAR spectrum of a two-component
thermal model (one using the ﬁtted thermal parameters,
the other a chosen temperature between 5−12 MK). The
emission measure of the second component starts with a
large value (that of the lower temperature ﬁt) and is iter-
atively reduced until there are fewer than 4 counts above
6 keV, consistent within 2σ of a null detection (Gehrels
1986). This is repeated for each temperature and region.
The resulting upper limits (Figure 5) range from about
1046cm−3 at 5 MK to 1043cm−3 at 12 MK, with the low-
est limits coming from the observations with the largest
eﬀective exposure, P2.

Compared to the observations from EUNIS (Brosius
et al. 2014) and SMM/FCS (Del Zanna & Mason 2014)
the NuSTAR limits are at least an order of magnitude
lower (Figure 5, middle panel). This might be due
to these previous studies observing ARs with brighter
hot emission. Even within the NuSTAR limits there is
about an order of magnitude spread from the diﬀerent
regions. The high temperature values from EUNIS and
SMM/FCS are calculated using the maximum of the con-
tribution functions G(T ), an isothermal approach using
the peak formation temperature. If the emission is due
to a wider range of temperatures, and the DEM is ex-
pected to be sharply falling with temperature, then the
actual emission is from lower temperatures. This “eﬀec-
tive temperature” was calculated for SMM/FCS Fe XVIII
(Del Zanna & Mason 2014) giving emission at 5 MK, in-
stead of the 8 MK using the peak formation tempera-
ture (red upper limit versus square in Figure 5, middle
panel). The DEMs of quiescent ARs from X-ray spec-
troscopy (Parkinson 1975; Del Zanna & Mason 2014)
show emission over 2-4 MK. The NuSTAR isothermal
ﬁts are consistent with the Skylark results but higher
than the SMM/FCS. This again could be indicative of
quiescent ARs producing a wide range of emission.

We scale the NuSTAR limits by the fraction of the
SDO/AIA 94˚A Fe XVIII emission in each region to com-
pare to other full-disk X-ray spectroscopy of quiescent
ARs. About 0.5% of the full-disk emission comes from
D1, 1.1% for D2, 1.4% for L1, 4.4% for L2 and 3.5%

for L3. These NuSTAR full disk limits (Figure 5, bot-
tom panel) match the range of emission observed with
RHESSI (McTiernan 2009) and the DEM from X123
(Caspi et al. 2015). The SphinX two-thermal ﬁt gives
emission considerably lower than the scaled NuSTAR val-
ues, which is still consistent as they are upper limits. The
SphinX values are small as they are from a period of very
low solar activity and averaged over a month of observa-
tions.

5. CONCLUSIONS

NuSTAR is a uniquely sensitive telescope, capable of
observing faint X-ray emission from the non-ﬂaring Sun.
This paper shows for the ﬁrst time X-ray emission above
2 keV directly imaged from quiescent ARs. The spectra
of these regions are well ﬁtted by 3.1-4.4 MK isothermal
emission. We have not detected a higher temperature or
non-thermal contribution to the HXR spectra for these
ARs. We place strict constraints on hotter sources, re-
quiring them to decrease with at least T −8, which is con-
sistent with impulsive heating models (e.g. Cargill 1994;
Klimchuk et al. 2008). To increase NuSTAR‘s spectral
dynamic range, improving our ability to detect or fur-
ther constrain high temperature and non-thermal contri-
butions, we need observations with larger eﬀective expo-
sure times. This can be achieved by longer duration ob-
servations and/or diminishing solar activity (producing
lower deadtime). Accessing NuSTAR‘s full sensitivity,
combined with other new data from the FOXSI (Krucker
et al. 2014) and MAGIXS (Kobayashi et al. 2011) sound-
ing rockets, will provide crucial steps towards improved
X-ray observations of the Sun and understanding the na-
ture of its quiescent energy release.
