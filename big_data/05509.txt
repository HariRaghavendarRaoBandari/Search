ABSTRACT
Popular models of fast radio bursts (FRBs) involve the gravitational collapse of
neutron star progenitors to black holes. It has been proposed that the shedding of
the strong neutron star magnetic ﬁeld (B) during the collapse is the power source
for the radio emission. Previously, these models have utilized the simplicity of the
Schwarzschild metric which has the restriction that the magnetic ﬂux is magnetic
“hair” that must be shed before ﬁnal collapse. But, neutron stars have angular mo-
mentum and charge and a fully relativistic Kerr Newman solution exists in which B
has its source inside of the event horizon. In this letter, we consider the magnetic ﬂux
to be shed as a consequence of the electric discharge of a metastable collapsed state
of a Kerr Newman black hole. It has also been argued that the shedding model will
not operate due to pair creation. By considering the pulsar death line, we ﬁnd that
for a neutron star with B = 1011
− 1013 G and a long rotation period, > 1 s this is
not a concern. We also discuss the observational evidence supporting the plausibility
of magnetic ﬂux shedding models of FRBs that are spawned from rapidly rotating
progenitors.

INTRODUCTION

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a new kind of astrophysi-
cal transient that is of unknown origin. First discovered
in Lorimer et al. (2007), it was later found that the distri-
bution lies primarily well above the Galactic plane. Com-
bined with a large dispersion measure indicates a celes-
tial origin and large distances corresponding to redshifts,
0.5 < z < 1 (Thorton et al. 2013). The radio bursts dura-
tions are on the order of milliseconds with a radio luminosity
of 1038 − 1040 ergs (Zhang 2014). The space density is large,
10−3 gal−1 yr−1 compared to gamma ray bursts (GRBs), a
factor of 1000 larger (Zhang 2014). Light travel time argu-
ments based on 1 msec imply that the emission region is very
compact, less than 20 times a neutron star (NS) radius or 30
times the diameter of a black hole (BH) of a few solar masses.
This inspired the “blitzar” model of FRBs that is based on
NS collapse to a BH, Falcke and Rezzolla (2014), that was
later adapted to the work of Zhang (2014). The models be-
gin with a supramassive NS that is marginally supported by
centrifugal force. During the collapse, the magnetic “hair” is
released, the so-called “no hair theorem.” This is the mag-

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS

netic energy source for the FRB in the model. It has been
largely forgotten, but the model of shedding magnetic hair
was originally proposed to explain GRBs (Hanami 1997).

This letter is concerned with the two fundamental phys-
ical points of concern for the model. Firstly, previous FRB
models have considered a Schwarzschild metric. With this
restriction, the magnetic ﬁeld cannot have its source within
the black hole and the ﬁeld is considered magnetic hair that
needs to shed during the collapse. In reality, there is angu-
lar momentum and charge and the Kerr-Newmann solution
(a charged rotating black hole, KNBH hereafter) allows for
a magnetic ﬁeld that has its source inside the event hori-
zon. The neutron star is charged and rotating, so is the
black hole. The second issue is the notion that the magnetic
ﬂux might not be released since pair creation in the mag-
netosphere might self-sustain the ﬁeld even after collapse
(Lyutikov and McKinney 2011). We ﬁnd an interpretation
involving a progenitor NS beyond the “pulsar death line”
and electric discharge of a meta-stable KNBH intermedi-
ate state that allows the magnetic ﬁeld shedding model of
FRBs to proceed regardless of these concerns. Heavy dead

pulsars may require centrifugal force to be supported against
gravitational collapse. We argue that that the torque down
of dead pulsars could initiate collapse with a space density
consistent with the FRB space density. We also comment on
whether a supramssive rapidly rotating NS can collapse to
form a meta-stable KNBH.

2 THE KERR-NEWMAN FIELD ENERGY

The magnetic ﬁeld energy responsible for the FRB was
calculated outside a NS in the Newtonian approximation
(Zhang 2014). In this section, we calculate the magnetic
ﬁeld energy and the electric ﬁeld energy in the Kerr-Newman
spacetime that represents a rotating charged black hole with
a net magnetic ﬂux through each hemisphere. The axisym-
metric, time stationary spacetime metric is uniquely deter-
mined by three quantities, M , a and Q, the mass, angular
momentum per unit mass, and the charge of the hole re-
spectively. In Boyer–Lindquist coordinates the metric, gµν,
is given by the line element in geometrized units

where Σ = r2 + a2 cos2 θ and
∆ = r2 − 2M r + a2 + Q2 ≡ (r − r+)(r − r−) .

There are two event horizons given by the roots of the
equation ∆ = 0. The outer horizon at r+ is of physical
interest

r+ = M +pM 2 − Q2 − a2 .

We choose to simplify our calculations by computing quan-
tities in a hypersurface orthogonal, orthonormal frame. A
natural orthonormal frame associated with Zero Angular
Momentum Observers (ZAMO) (who are also locally non-
rotating) can be used to express, locally, the electromagnetic
ﬁeld in terms of electric and magnetic (observer-dependent)
ﬁelds. Being hypersurface orthogonal (i.e., vorticity-free),
the ZAMO frame gives an unambiguous deﬁnition of the
ﬁeld that is integrable (Punsly 2008). The basis covectors
are

ˆ0 = 1/p−gttdt , ω ˆr = √grrdr ,
ˆθ = √gθθdθ , ω
ˆφ = √gφφdφ .

Due to the long expressions to follow, it is worthwhile to
abbreviate the notation for (sin θ, cos θ) as (s, c), i.e. Σ =

3 COLLAPSE OF THE NEUTRON STAR

In this section, we discuss the assumptions used in our study
of neutron star collapse in the ﬁeld shedding model.

(i) The initial B ﬁeld is approximately dipolar at the NS

surface.

(ii) The ﬂux stays frozen into the superconducting ﬂuid

of subatomic particles as it collapses through the horizon.

(iii) The mass and angular momentum are approximately

conserved during the collapse.

One problem with analyzing these assumptions with
numerical simulations is that the fundamental physics is
not well understood. The ﬁnal result is driven by assump-
tions of the numerical code and imposed expediences used
to avoid complicated physics. Thus, there are a variety of
disparate outcomes. As mentioned in the introduction, the
ﬂux shedding model of FRBs and GRBs in Hanami (1997);
Falcke and Rezzolla (2014); Zhang (2014) take place in a
Schwarzschild background and the authors identify the mag-
netic ﬂux as “hair”. However, if the progenitor NS has a
magnetic ﬂux, ΦNS, through the northern hemisphere, by
Equation (9) and assumptions (2) and (3), above, the NS
with angular momentum per unit mass, aNS, and mass,
MNS, can, in principle, collapse to a KNBH deﬁned by

Qa =

ΦNS
2πr+

,

a = aNS , M = MNS ,

(14)

without violating any principles of relativity. Thus, there is
no “hair” to shed.

It was proposed in Lyutikov and McKinney (2011), that
pair creation similar to that in the standard pulsar model
will continue to seed the magnetosphere during collapse and
source the poloidal ﬁeld eternally after the black hole forms.
Thereby transferring the ﬁeld source form the NS matter to
an external magnetospheric pair plasma. The steady state
is a “boot-strapping” model in which the pairs create the
electromagnetic ﬁeld which in turn create the pairs. How-
ever, force-free simulations of the collapse of a rotating NS
found that the magnetic ﬂux is shed during collapse due
to reconnection (Lehner et al. 2012). Also, using a variety
assumptions both Hanami (1997) and Dionysopoulou et al.
(2013) showed an electromagnetic pulse that accompanies
the shedding of the magnetic ﬂux before the current source
penetrates the event horizon. However, the background met-
ric is not altered by the charge and angular momentum of
the collapsing matter, so it does not represent the allowed
KN solution in which magnetic ﬂux shedding need not occur.

There is simply not enough known about the physics
to resolve this issue at present. However, we seek a sub-
set of solution space that circumvents the objection posed
by Lyutikov and McKinney (2011). We consider the no-
tion of a death-line for pulsars (Chen and Ruderman 1993).
The idea is that the energy available to produce electron-
positron pairs is the voltage drop across magnetic ﬁeld lines,
∆V , which scales like ∆V ∼ B/PNS as a consequence of
the frozen-in condition in a rotating magnetosphere (where

Log of Period of Neutron Star (sec)

Figure 1. The stored electric and magnetic energy of the
metastable Kerr-Newman black hole as a function of the progen-
itor neutron star, BNS and P . The pulsar death-lines are super-
imposed based on a dipolar NS magnetic ﬁeld. The stored energy
increases for supramassive progenitors with larger radii.

PNS is the pulsar rotational period). So for any pair cre-
ation mechanism, as B decreases or PNS increases, there
will be insuﬃcient energy to initiate the pair creation that
seeds the magnetosphere with plasma. There will be no ob-
servable pulsar. Particle-in-cell simulations of rotating ﬁeld
aligned dead pulsars indicate that the magnetic ﬁeld is not
in the force-free conﬁguration, as assumed in the simula-
tions of Lehner et al. (2012), but is in a dipolar conﬁguration
(Chen and Beloborodov 2014). This agrees with our ﬁrst as-
sumption in this section. It is proposed that even though
B/PNS increases during the collapse, by assumptions (2)
and (3), the fact that there is no pre-existing plasma-ﬁlled
magnetosphere will not allow the change in ∆V to eﬀectu-
ate plasma ﬁlling of the magnetosphere before the subatomic
ﬂuid passes out of causal contact. Thus, a KNBH might be
able to form, but likely for only a brief instant as we discuss
below.

4 THE KERR-NEWMAN METASTABLE

STATE

As the superconducting ﬂuid pulls its magnetic ﬂux inward
during the collapse, a charge separation occurs. The faster
rotation and larger B implied by assumptions (2) and (3)
create a cross ﬁeld potential, ∆V , the same eﬀect described
above in the pair creation discussion above. The diﬀerence is
that within the dense subatomic material there are numer-
ous collisions that allows charge to separate instantaneously
across the B ﬁeld in order to keep the plasma frozen-in
(the unipolar inductor aﬀect) (Punsly 2008). This process
proceeds promptly regardless of the tenuous pair plasma in
the magnetosphere (which is unable to cross the ﬁeld lines).
Thus, the dense subatomic ﬂuid is likely to pass within the
event horizon with its magnetic ﬂux frozen-in, unimpeded
by the physics of the tenuous magnetospheric plasma. The
increase of the intrinsic charge density of the collapsed mat-
ter implies that charge is ejected outward by the unipolar

4

inductor (i.e., the unipolar driven current). The net result
is that the local physical process will increase the magni-
tude of the total charge of the collapsed object. The same
physics causes a neutron star to have a net charge in a pul-
sar (Ruderman and Sutherland 1975). The charge that is
added to the subatomic ﬂuid as a consequence of the charge
separation driven by unipolar induction during the collapse
increases the charge from the NS value to that of the KNBH
in Equation (14), QBH ∼ [(M RNS)/(a2)]QNS.
The increase in the charge of the subatomic ﬂuid de-
scribed above results in a major diﬀerence between the NS
electromagnetic ﬁeld and the KNBH electromagnetic ﬁeld.
The NS electromagnetic ﬁeld is magnetic (E2 − B2 < 0),
meaning that there exist local physical observers that can
see the ﬁeld as purely magnetic, but there is no observer
that can see a purely electric ﬁeld. Conversely, by Equation
(6), the KNBH electromagnetic ﬁeld is electric everywhere
(Punsly 1998). Since there is an unscreened mono-polar elec-
tric ﬁeld, the KNBH is subject to electric discharge. It is the
electric discharge that sheds the magnetic ﬁeld by Equation
(14). Note that in the case of exactly zero angular momen-
tum, the Schwarzschild black hole, there is no solution for
a magnetic ﬂux source inside of the event horizon that is
allowed in general relativity and the no hair theorem is the
appropriate interpretation of the ﬂux shedding. In spite of
the argument in the previous section, with our current level
of understanding of the relevant microphysics, one can not
say if it is possible for the discharge to take place before
the black hole forms. However, based on the discussion of
unipolar induction above, we consider this unlikely.

In this letter, we consider a prompt discharge of the
KNBH, i.e., it is a metastable conﬁguration that occurs as
part of the collapse. We plot the stored electric and mag-
netic energy in Figure 1 using Equation (13). We assume
a low centrifugal force conﬁguration of the progenitor NS
with collapse to a BH occurring once the Chandrasekhar
limit is exceeded by unspeciﬁed interactive processes with
the surrounding medium, M = 1.5M⊙. A supramassive NS
progenitor as in Falcke and Rezzolla (2014); Zhang (2014)
would have a larger mass M >
∼2.5M⊙ and a lerger progeni-
tor radius. The stored energy is plotted as a function of the
NS magnetic ﬁeld strength at the pole, BNS, in the dipo-
lar approximation. The assumed radius of the NS is 12 km.
Note that the magnetic energy is independent of the rota-
tional period for small a/M . The electric energy increases
for smaller a, if BNS at the neutron star pole is held ﬁxed,
as a consequence of Equation (13). The relevant death-line
from Chen and Ruderman (1993) is the one for a dipolar
magnetic ﬁeld that is assumed here. They noted that other
magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations can move the death-line to the
right, however that would be inconsistent with the assump-
tions of the previous calculations in this letter. For slow
rotating NS progenitors there is an allowed collapsed state
KNBH solution for parameters to the right of the death-
line where pair production is suppressed. The power of the
FRBs can be explained for BNS
than 1 second. The rapidly rotating (such as as supramas-
sive) progenitors require a large centrifugal force to support
them and lie to the left of the death-line. It is also evident
that the stored electric energy exceeds the magnetic energy.
We estimate E (magn) and E (elec) in Equation (13) in terms
of the progenitor NS values in order to make contact with

∼1012 G and periods longer

The magnetic ﬁeld energy computed in Zhang (2014) is cap-
tured in the last term in square brackets.

The logical question is whether this stored energy can
be extracted. Ostensibly, since the energy is electromagnetic
it can be radiated near the speed of light and can avoid being
swallowed by the black hole. We explore if there is a funda-
mental general relativistic reason that the energy cannot be
radiated by considering the irreducible mass. The mass of
the black hole decomposes into its rest mass, reducible mass
and irreducible mass (Christodoulou and Ruﬃni 1971):

The irreducible mass cannot be extracted from the black

can be extracted in principle. From Equations (13) and (16),

The electromagnetic stored energy is extractable. The last

5 CONCLUSION

In this paper, it was proposed that the magnetic ﬁeld shed-
ding model of FRBs can be understood self-consistently if
one includes a metastable KNBH state after the collapse
from a progenitor NS. The magnetic ﬂux is shed by elec-
tric discharge and not because of a no hair requirement.
The analysis of the last section resolves some issues and
raises more questions. For NS progenitors with PNS > 1
sec, the pulsar death-line indicates that collapse to a KNBH
should occur without any inﬂuence from pair creation in
the magnetosphere. This state can discharge electrically
thereby reproducing the magnetic ﬁeld shedding in the FRB
and GRB models (Hanami 1997; Falcke and Rezzolla 2014;
Zhang 2014). The argument has a range of applicability for
1011G < BNS < 1013G.

The vast majority of pulsars are likely dead and are
generally of low luminosity and not detected. However, it
is believed that spin up accretion in a binary system can
recycle dead pulsars at a rate ≈ 1.5 − 3.0 × 10−3yr−1
(Deshpande et al. 1995). However, it is known that accre-
tion can also spin down pulsars (Chakrabarty et al. 1997).
This spin-down will increase the mass of the NS and de-
crease centrifugal force. For a heavier NS, centrifugal force

might be required to prevent gravitational collapse and spin
down accretion might initiate catastrophic collapse to a BH.
The catastrophic collapse rate of dead pulsars would likely
be the same order of magnitude as the recycle rate of dead
pulsars, ≈ 1.5 − 3.0× 10−3yr−1, which agrees with the FRB
birth rate, 10−3 gal−1 yr−1. The reducible mass associated
with the magnetic ﬁeld in Equation (17) would be mani-
fest as an electromagnetic pulse that has been proposed to
power the FRB either from high energy pair plasma in a
shock wave or by coherent emission from particle bunch-
ing in the strong electromagnetic wave (Falcke and Rezzolla
2014; Zhang 2014). From Figure 1, the metastable KNBH
low spin state has a stored electric energy that far exceeds
the stored magnetic energy. Being longitudinally polarized,
the release of this energy is not directly into electromag-
netic waves. It has been proposed (and extensively modeled)
that the reducible mass in Equation (17) is extracted by a
ﬁreball of pair plasma in models of GRBs with afterglow
(Ruﬃni et al. 2001). The energy of FRB 150418 and its af-
terglow is ∼ 1049 − 1050ergs, consistent with the stored elec-
tric energy in Figure 1 (Keane et al 2016; Zhang 2016). It
may also be that FRB 150418 represents a diﬀerent class of
FRB and this is a numerical coincidence (Keane et al 2016).
For the supramassive NS invoked in Falcke and Rezzolla
(2014); Zhang (2014) the death-line argument cannot be
used to validate this scenario since they require PNS < 0.1
s in order to provide adequate centrifugal support. Force-
free simulations indicate that the ﬂux will be shed by
prompt reconnection and no KNBH meatastable states form
(Lehner et al. 2012). Although the “electric ﬁeld pruning”
that was implemented might render such a simulation in-
capable of ﬁnding KNBHs and their “electric” magneto-
spheres. In any event, these results raise the question of
whether there is any observational evidence of highly mag-
netized black hole magnetospheres associated with stellar
mass black holes. There is a major prediction of such a
scenario, the magnetosphere will produce a tenuous out-
ﬂow of electron-positron plasma at a highly relativistic ve-
locity in the form of a jet or wind (Blandford and Znajek
1977; Lyutikov and McKinney 2011). We ﬁnd no direct ob-
servations of highly relativistic winds from black holes, yet
there are numerous observations indicating non-relativistic
or mildly relativistic jets and ejections. The two most pub-
licized examples of highly superluminal motion have not
stood the test of time and better data. The direct obser-
vations of component motion in Galactic BHs show sublu-
minal or slightly superluminal motion, not the highly su-
perluminal motion expected from black hole driven mag-
netically dominated outﬂows. For example, the discrete
ejecta in GRO J1655-40 are no longer considered to be
highly superluminal and are now believed to move ∼ 037c
(Foellmi et al 2006). The parallax determined distance mea-
surement to GRS 1915+105 is 8.6+2.0
−1.6 kpc (Reid et al. 2014).
This changes the intrinsic velocity of the discrete ejections
to 0.65c - 0.81c. The parallax measurements and the jet
asymmetry arguments in Ribo et al. (2004) indicate that
the compact jet in GRS 1915+105 propagates with 0.07c
< v < 0.37c. The best case for moderately relativistic ejec-
tion in a Galactic BH is a Lorentz factor of 2 in one of
the ﬂares of XTE J1550-564, the other ﬂares are consider-
ably slower (Orosz et al. 2011). This result, even though it
is not the highly relativistic speed expected from an event

horizon magnetospheric outﬂow, still depends on a distance
estimate that has not been veriﬁed by a parallax obser-
vation. One could argue that the slow outﬂow velocities
are the manifestation of mass loading from the enveloping
medium (Murguia-Berthier et al. 2014). But, interferomet-
ric observations of ejecta in Galactic BHs agree with radio
light curves - the speed ≈constant with no abrupt luminos-
ity change near the time of ejection (Dhawan et al 2000;
Punsly & Rodriguez 2013). Baryon loading (if it occurs)
seems to occur at the source. Yet, the putative event horizon
magnetosphere is baryon poor. The observations seem to in-
dicate that the event horizons of Galactic black holes are ei-
ther weakly magnetized or non-magnetized. Apparently, any
signiﬁcant magnetization that they had was a brief transient
or was shed during formation.
