ABSTRACT
Two-body interactions play a major role in shaping the structural and dynamical prop-
erties of globular clusters (GCs) over their long-term evolution. In particular, GCs
evolve toward a state of partial energy equipartition that induces a mass-dependence
in their kinematics. By using a set of Monte Carlo cluster simulations evolved in quasi-
isolation, we show that the stellar mass dependence of the velocity dispersion σ(m)
can be described by an exponential function σ2 ∝ exp(−m/meq), with the param-
eter meq quantifying the degree of partial energy equipartition of the systems. This
simple parametrization successfully captures the behaviour of the velocity dispersion
at lower as well as higher stellar masses, that is, the regime where the system is ex-
pected to approach full equipartition. We ﬁnd a tight correlation between the degree
of equipartition reached by a GC and its dynamical state, indicating that clusters that
are more than about 20 core relaxation times old, have reached a maximum degree
of equipartition. This equipartition−dynamical state relation can be used as a tool
to characterize the relaxation condition of a cluster with a kinematic measure of the
meq parameter. Vice versa, the mass-dependence of the kinematics can be predicted
knowing the relaxation time solely on the basis of photometric measurements. More-
over, any deviations from this tight relation could be used as a probe of a peculiar
dynamical history of a cluster. Finally, our novel approach is important for the in-
terpretation of state-of-the-art Hubble Space Telescope proper motion data, for which
the mass dependence of kinematics can now be measured, and for the application of
modeling techniques which take into consideration multi-mass components and mass
segregation.

1 INTRODUCTION

The apparent simplicity of galactic globular clusters (GCs)
is the result of their >10 Gyr evolution driven by the com-
plex interplay of gravitational encounters (dynamical two-
body interactions between stars), interactions with the host
galaxy and internal stellar astrophysical processes. The deep
understanding of these evolutionary ingredients is the key to
interpret their current internal properties and to reveal their
formation during the earliest epochs of galaxy formation.

In particular, gravitational encounters, over the two-
body relaxation time-scale, are crucial in shaping the in-
ternal structural and dynamical properties of GCs. One of
the eﬀects of two-body interactions is to bring a system to-

ward a state of thermalization, where stars with diﬀerent
masses approach the same energy (Spitzer 1987). This is
known as energy equipartition: massive stars lose kinematic
energy sinking towards the center of the cluster, whilst, vice
versa, low-mass stars gain kinetic energy and move toward
the outer parts. This produces a mass-dependence of the
kinematics with massive stars displaying a lower velocity dis-
persion than low-mass stars, and furthermore induces mass
segregation.

Starting from the early work of Spitzer (1969), studies
have been devoted to the understanding of how the process
of energy equipartition takes place in GCs, pointing out that
in a simple two-mass component system, energy equiparti-
tion is not always reached. Depending on the mass ratio of
the particles of diﬀerent species (m1/m2), as well as their
contribution to the total mass of the system (M1/M2), the
self-gravity of the heavier stars can dominate the potential
in the core, and create a sub-system which is dynamically
separated from the lighter components. Such a sub-system

will no longer be in energy equipartition with the rest of
the system, and it may even undergo gravothermal collapse,
while the light stars will not (“Spitzer instability”). This re-
sult was later generalized by Vishniac (1978) for the case of
a continuous mass spectrum.

Even in the Spitzer-stable case, many additional ele-
ments should be taken into account, in particular the fact
that the distribution of the velocities of the stars in the sys-
tem is aﬀected also by the change of the potential itself,
due to the change of the spatial distribution of the stars.
Calculations have been performed with various models for
the density-potential pairs, usually for the simple case of a
two-component system (e.g., see Lightman & Fall 1978 the
case of homogeneous spheres, or Inagaki & Wiyanto 1984 for
Fokker-Planck models). Relatively fewer studies have con-
sidered the evolution of multi-mass systems, but the lack of
energy equipartition emerged very emphatically especially
in the Fokker-Plank study by Inagaki & Saslaw (1985).

This issue has been explored also by means of multi-
mass N-body simulations, which have oﬀered convincing ev-
idence that collisional systems reach a state of only partial
energy equipartition, especially in the outer regions (e.g., see
Baumgardt & Makino 2003, Sect. 3.5; Khalisi et al. 2007).
More recently, Trenti & van der Marel (2013) performed a
systematic N-body study to characterize the dependence of
the velocity dispersion on mass σ(m), in terms of the scaling
σ ∝ m−η (where η = 0.5 corresponds to full equipartition).
They ﬁnd that η < 0.5, i.e. corresponding to only partial
energy equipartition. Moreover, the lack of energy equipar-
tition has also been tested with direct N-body simulations
in the regime of open clusters (Spera et al. sub). Finally, an
additional conﬁrmation of the lack of energy equipartition
in globular clusters comes also from the side of distribution
function-based models, especially lowered isothermal multi-
mass equilibria (see Appendix).

Even though GCs are not in full energy equipartition,
the mass dependence of kinematics represents an additional
complication to take into consideration for a complete un-
derstanding of the current internal dynamics of GCs. In
fact, traditional modeling techniques that do not take into
consideration this mass dependence present limitations that
in general should be fully explored (Shanahan & Gieles
2015; Sollima et al. 2015). Secondly, the evidence of mass-
dependent kinematics should motivate the development and
the application of multi-mass models, which could provide
a more comprehensive and realistic description of the inter-
nal dynamics of GCs (e.g., the multi-mass generalization of
the classic King models, proposed by Da Costa & Freeman
1976 or the recently developed family of multi-mass lowered
isothermal models by Gieles & Zocchi 2015).

Mass-dependent kinematics is now within reach of our
observational capabilities, thanks to the combination of tra-
ditional spectroscopic-based line-of-sight velocities and high-
precision Hubble Space Telescope (HST ) proper motions
studies. In particular, the latter provide samples up to 100×
larger than the traditional line-of-sight velocity data sets,
and allow us to measure the velocities for both giant stars
and less-massive main sequence stars (see HSTPROMO data
sets for 22 GCs, Bellini et al. 2014; Watkins et al. 2015a,b;
Baldwin et al. sub; Bianchini et al. sub; and references
therein for other proper motion samples for speciﬁc GCs).
We therefore wish to introduce a novel approach for the

analysis of energy equipartition in GCs suitable for appli-
cations to both simulations and observations. Traditionally,
the mass-dependent kinematics have been analyzed using
the simple power-law dependence of the velocity dispersion
on mass, σ ∝ m−η, that strictly is only valid for restricted
stellar mass ranges (Trenti & van der Marel 2013). Fitting
this function to simulations showed that the η parameter
is higher at the higher mass end (stellar remnants) than for
the lower mass stars, indicating that a mass dependence of η
is, in fact, needed. Moreover, the analysis of the simulations
has been limited to studies of clusters with ﬁxed relaxation
conditions (Trenti & van der Marel 2013), not allowing a
direct comparison with real GC systems, characterized by a
variety of relaxation conditions.

For this reason our work will be based on two premises.
(1) The analysis of energy equipartition will be performed
on a set of simulations all observed at a ﬁxed time-snapshot.
This gives us the advantage of creating a similarity to what
we can actually observe, that is the Milky Way (MW) GCs
that can be considered roughly coeval (Meylan & Heggie
1997) and characterized by systems with a variety of relax-
ation states. (2) Extend the simple power-law σ ∝ m−η,
introducing a more ﬂexible function that can provide a ﬁt
to the mass-dependent velocity dispersion σ(m) in the entire
stellar mass range with a mass-dependent slope η = η(m).
Additionally, the function should provide a quantitative
measure of the degree of energy equipartition reached by a
system. The combination of the two points above will allow
us to study the variety of mass-dependence of kinematics
that we could expect for the MW GC system and to ﬁnd
possible correlations of the degree of partial equipartition
with cluster properties.

In Sect. 2 we introduce the set of Monte Carlo cluster
simulations used in this work and describe the construction
of the σ(m) proﬁles. In Sect. 3 the new ﬁtting function is
introduced and applied to the simulations. Section. 4 is de-
voted to the analysis of the results of the ﬁts to the simula-
tions and the study of how the degree of partial equiparti-
tion relates to cluster properties. In Sect. 5, we discuss the
implication of our ﬁndings and, ﬁnally we summarize our
conclusions in Sect. 6.

2 SIMULATIONS
We consider a set of Monte Carlo cluster simulations, devel-
oped by Downing et al. (2010) with the Monte Carlo code
of Giersz (1998) (see also Hypki & Giersz 2013). The sim-
ulations include an initial mass function, stellar evolution,
primordial binaries, and a relatively high number of parti-
cles, providing a realistic description of the long-term evo-
lution of GCs with a single stellar population.1 No internal
rotation is considered.

All simulations have their initial conditions drawn from
a Plummer (1911) model, a Kroupa (2001) initial mass func-
tion, a metallicity of [Fe/H]=−1.3, and an initial tidal cut-
oﬀ at 150 pc (making the simulations relatively isolated,
comparable to halo clusters at 9 − 10 kpc from the cen-
ter of the MW). We consider a total of 6 simulations with
500 000 initial particles, characterized by 3 values of initial
concentrations and 2 values for the initial binary fraction
(either 10% or 50%). We also consider an additional simula-
tion with 2 000 000 particles and 10% initial binary fraction.
All the snapshots that we will consider here are pre-core col-
lapse2 and are indicative of typical metal poor GC spanning
a large range of initial concentrations, binary fractions, and
relatively high number of particles. The details of the initial
conditions of the simulations are summarised in Table 1 and
described in Downing et al. (2010), expect sim 7 (10low75-
2M), not present in the original work. The quantities used
to characterized the initial conditions of the simulations are
all intrinsic 3-dimensional quantities. The simulations were
kindly shared by J. M. B. Downing.

We report in Table 2 the properties of the simulations
typically assessed by observations, speciﬁcally for the time-
snapshots at 4, 7, 11 Gyr. We report the concentration c
deﬁned as c = log(Rt/Rc), with Rt the projected tidal ra-
dius3 and Rc the projected core radius; the projected core
radius Rc, deﬁned as the radius where the surface density is

1 Note that Monte Carlo simulations provide a high degree of
realism achievable at low computational costs; moreover, they are
consistent with direct N-body simulations (Wang et al. 2016).
2 We restrict our investigations to pre-core collapsed systems
since the interplay between mass segregation and core collapse
is highly non-trivial; moreover, the majority of MW GCs are ex-
pected to be in a pre-core collapsed phase (Harris 2010).

radius Rh, containing half of the luminosity of the cluster;
the logarithm of the half-mass relaxation time Trh and the
logarithm of the core relaxation time Trc. For the relaxation
times, we follow the approach of the Harris (2010) catalog,
that is Eq. (10) of Djorgovski (1993) for the core relaxation
time:

2.1 Construction of velocity dispersion-mass

proﬁles

In order to quantify the mass dependence of the kinemat-
ics of our simulations, we construct the projected velocity
dispersion proﬁle as a function of stellar mass, σ(m). We
restrict the analysis to stars within the projected half-light
radius 6 Rh (considering a cylinder of radius Rh around the
z-axis as the line-of-sight direction) and include all the stars
of our simulations within the mass range 0.1 − 1.8 M(cid:12) (the
eﬀect of diﬀerent stellar objects such as binary stars and
stellar remnants is separately discussed in Sect. 2.2)7. For
every 0.1 M(cid:12) mass interval, we calculate the projected one-
dimensional velocity dispersion and the associated errors,
averaging the velocity dispersions of the three spatial coor-
dinates. We point out that we consider projected quantities
in order to enable a direct comparison with observations.

4 Calculated from number count surface density proﬁles.
5 We deﬁne the central mass density of the cluster as the density
enclosed within Rh/10.
6 GCs kinematics are typically observed within the half-light ra-
dius.
7 The upper limit of 1.8 M(cid:12) is chosen to guarantee a high enough
number of stars per bin, since only a few stars have masses greater
than that.

Figure 2. Velocity dispersion as a function of stellar mass for the 4, 7, 11 Gyr snapshots of Simulation 5, for all stars within the half-light
radius (orange circles), only white dwarf (green circles), and excluding white dwarfs (open black circles). The lowest-mass white dwarfs
(≈ 0.6 M(cid:12)) show a lower velocity dispersion than the other stars with similar mass, biasing the velocity dispersion of the sample with
all stars towards lower values. The lower velocity dispersion of low-mass white dwarfs can be explained by the fact that they have not
reached the same equipartition level as they recently underwent severe mass loss. The large error bars in the ﬁrst and last panels are due
to low number statistics.

Figure 3. Fit to the projected velocity dispersion as a function of the stellar mass σ(m) using the exponential ﬁtting function introduced
with Eq. 3. The free parameter meq indicates the degree of equipartition reached by the system. The ﬁt is shown for Simulation 1 in
both a log-log scale (left panel) and in a linear-log scale (right panel) and it is performed on all stars within the half-mass radius. The
proﬁles are normalized at m=0, using the best ﬁt parameter σ0 (see Eq. 3). The dotted line shows the power-law function σ ∝ m−1/2
indicating full energy equipartition. The horizontal line intersects the ﬁtting function at m = meq; beyond this mass the slope of the
ﬁtting function is kept constant at σ ∝ m−1/2 (solid line). The exponential ﬁtting function provides an excellent ﬁt on all the sampled
mass range.

2.2 Role of binary stars and stellar remnants

In order to understand the role of diﬀerent stellar objects
in shaping the mass dependence of the velocity dispersion,
we analyze separately the σ(m) proﬁle for binary stars and
for stellar remnants. When considering binaries, we use the
kinematics of their centre-of-mass.

Fig. 1 shows the result of our analysis: in the left pan-
els the comparison between all stars and binary stars is re-
ported, while in the right panels the comparison between
the proﬁles with all stars, excluding dark remnants and ex-
cluding all remnants. From this we conclude that, for all the

time-snapshots analyzed, binary stars and stellar remnants
follow the same σ(m) relation of single stars. However it is
worth noting that around 0.6 M(cid:12) the shape of σ(m) shows
a systematic dip. The right panels of Fig. 1 indicate that
white dwarfs could be responsible for this feature, since the
σ(m) proﬁle excluding all remnants does not show this dip
around 0.6 M(cid:12).

We investigate the eﬀect of white dwarfs, by plotting
in Fig. 2 separately all stars with and without white dwarfs
and white dwarfs alone. White dwarfs that have recently
formed and with masses around 0.6 M(cid:12) underwent a severe
mass loss. Their kinematics are not consistent with the one

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

6

P. Bianchini et al.

of other stellar objects with comparable mass, since they
did not have time to dynamically relax. Therefore they are
characterized by a lower velocity dispersion, in agreement
with their original higher mass (see also Heyl et al. 2015).
As the cluster evolves, two-body interactions slowly reduce
this diﬀerence, as observed for the more evolved snapshots
at 7 and 11 Gyr.

In the following analysis we will construct σ(m) proﬁles

excluding white dwarfs, in order to avoid any bias.

3 FITTING THE VELOCITY DISPERSION −

MASS PROFILE

We wish to ﬁnd a parametrization for the σ(m) proﬁle that
describes the mass dependence of kinematics in the entire
stellar mass range sampled and quantiﬁes how close/far from
energy equipartition the systems are. Traditionally a power-
law σ ∝ m−η has been used for limited ranges of masses,
showing that the best ﬁt parameter η is higher for the higher
mass end (stellar remnants) than for the lower mass stars
(Trenti & van der Marel 2013). This indicates the diﬀerential
behaviour of equipartition that is reached more eﬃciently in
the higher-stellar mass regime ( >∼ 1 M(cid:12)) than in the lower-
stellar mass regime, where the σ(m) proﬁle ﬂattens ( <∼ 0.3
M(cid:12)). It is therefore evident that a single η value is not able
to describe the entire trend of the σ(m) proﬁle and a ﬁtting
function with η = η(m) is needed.

3.1 Exponential ﬁtting function
We propose a simple exponential function, suitable for the
entire stellar mass range sampled, and able to reproduce
both the ﬂat behaviour in the limit of low stellar masses and
the steepening towards higher masses. A physical justiﬁca-
tion of the asymptotic limits is described in the Appendix.
The function is characterized by a velocity scale parameter
σ0 and one mass scale parameter meq:

if m ≤ meq,
if m > meq.

Here, σ0 indicates the value of velocity dispersion at m = 0,
while σeq corresponds to the value of velocity dispersion at

(cid:1). The parameter meq quan-

tiﬁes the level of partial energy equipartition reached by the
systems. For m > meq the system is characterized by con-
stant full energy equipartition (σ ∝ m−1/2).
In accordance with the used power-law assumption
(σ ∝ m−η; Trenti & van der Marel 2013), the slope of
our function is
η(m) = − d ln σ
d ln m

if m ≤ meq,
if m > meq.

The truncation of the exponential function for m > meq
was introduced in Eq. 3 in order to avoid values of the slope
η > 1/2 that would unphysically exceed energy equipar-
tition as well as to match the asymptotic limits described
in the Appedix, based on analytical multi-mass distribution
function-based models (Gieles & Zocchi 2015).

The mass parameter meq will be used to quantify the

degree of equipartition throughout our work: a system has
reached equipartition in the stellar mass regime m >∼ meq.
Systems characterized by lower values of meq are thus closer
to full energy equipartition.

3.2 Application to the simulations
We apply Eq. (3) to our set of simulations and quantify,
through the parameter meq, the degree of partial equiparti-
tion reached by the systems. We perform two ﬁts: one using
all stars in the mass range 0.1 − 1.8 M(cid:12) (excluding white
dwarfs, as explained in Sect. 2.2) and one restricting to only
observable stars in the mass range 0.4 − 1.0 M(cid:12) (i.e., we
exclude all stellar remnants) in order to match the typical
observations.8

The ﬁt to all the stars is performed to the binned pro-
ﬁles (described in Sect. 2.1) and will be used to demonstrate
the performance of our ﬁtting function. In the case restricted
to observable stars only, we use a discrete ﬁtting approach,
which is particularly convenient and ﬂexible for an appli-
cation to real data, where errors or additional sources of
contamination need to be included in the ﬁt to the data. In
this latter case, we deﬁne a likelihood function as

where σ(mi) is given by Eq. (3), mi and vi are the stellar
mass and the velocity of the observed stars, and the free pa-
rameters are σ0 and meq. Note that here we assume a Gaus-
sian velocity distribution with zero mean velocity. The pa-
rameter space is explored using EMCEE, an aﬃne-invariant
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler (Foreman-
Mackey et al. 2013) and the mean and associated 1−sigma
errors are returned.

The horizontal line intersects the σ(m) proﬁle at m = meq,

provides an excellent description of the mass dependence of
the kinematics in all cases. Minor deviations are observed
exclusively in the high stellar mass regime of the most con-
centrated cluster model, which is likely about to reach the
condition of core collapse (see bottom panel, dark orange
line).

In particular, traditional spectroscopic line-of-sight measurements
observe giant stars with masses 0.8 − 0.9 M(cid:12) (for ∼ 10 Gyr clus-

formation for less massive main sequence stars, down to ∼ 0.4
M(cid:12) (Bellini et al. 2014; Watkins et al. 2015a,b); these could be
complemented by the state-of-the-art line-of-sight velocities ob-
servations by MUSE@VLT, able to sample stars down to ∼ 0.5

as also visualized in Fig. 5. This indicates that using only
a stellar mass range restricted to the current observations,
it is still possible to obtain a good global description of the
entire σ(m) proﬁle. In turn, this implies that we can also
predict the mass dependence of the kinematics for both low-
mass and high-mass stars for which the kinematics are not
measurable (including non-observable dark remnants).

The values of meq obtained from the ﬁts indicate that
the systems are, as expected, only in partial energy equipar-
tition, since the typical value of meq
>∼ 1.5 M(cid:12) indicates that
all the stars sampled below this mass are characterized by
a σ(m) proﬁle with a local slope η < 1/2 (see Eq. 4). In
the following section we investigate in detail the relation be-
tween the degree of partial energy equipartition reached by
a system and its global properties.

4 DEGREE OF EQUIPARTITION VERSUS

CLUSTER PROPERTIES

The ﬁtting function introduced in the previous section allows
us to characterize the degree of partial equipartition reached
by a cluster through the parameter meq. We now analyze
how this parameter correlates with structural properties of
the GC simulations.

The ﬁrst panel of Fig. 6 shows the relation between meq
and the cluster concentration c, for the three time snap-
shots of 4, 7, 11 Gyr indicated by the diﬀerent colours and
symbols. More concentrated clusters are characterized by a
lower value of meq, corresponding to a steeper slope of the
σ(m) proﬁle and, hence, are closer to energy equipartition
(the increase of slope with concentration was already evi-
dent in Fig. 4). The plot also shows that the equipartition-
concentration relation depends on the age of the cluster:
older clusters have reached a state closer to energy equipar-

of stellar mass for the 4, 7, 11 Gyr snapshots of all our simula-
tions. See Fig. 3 for details on the ﬁt. The simulations are color
coded according to their concentration (orange scale) with the
exception of simulation 7 (blue dots), the only simulation with
an initial number of particles of 2,000,000. The horizontal line
intersects the ﬁtting function at m = meq. The simple exponen-
tial function ﬁts well all our simulations in the entire mass range
sampled. Minor deviations are observed exclusively in the high-
mass regime of the most concentrated cluster model, which is
likely about to reach the condition of core collapse (see bottom
panel, c=2.06). Given a time snapshot, more concentrated clus-
ters display a steeper velocity dispersion − mass proﬁle. Older
snapshots have also steeper relation than younger ones, reﬂecting
the dynamical evolution of the clusters.

tition than younger clusters. This explains the three distinct
relations, one for each time snapshot in the plot. Note, how-
ever, that in view of an application to MW GCs, any age
dependence would only be marginally relevant, since all GCs
can be safely considered as coeval.

In order to explain this relation between a purely pho-
tometric quantity (concentration) and a purely kinematic
quantity (the degree of equipartition), we further investigate
the role of the relaxation condition of the systems. For this
reason, in the second panel of Fig. 6, we plot meq against
the current core relaxation time Trc calculated from Eq. 1,
for the particular time snapshot considered.9 Clusters with

Figure 6. Correlation between diﬀerent cluster properties and
the parameter meq obtained from the ﬁts to the simulations.
From top to bottom: the cluster concentration c = log(Rt/Rc)
(panel A), the logarithm of the current core relaxation time Trc
(panel B), and the numbers of relaxation times experienced by a
cluster nrel = Tage/Trc, with Tage the age of the cluster (panel
C). These plots demonstrate that the level of energy equiparti-
tion reached by a cluster depends on its relaxation condition. Well
relaxed clusters (characterized by nrel > 20) reach a maximum
value for the degree of energy equipartition. The solid line in panel
C is the best ﬁt for the meq − nrel correlation, see Sect. 5.

shorter relaxation times show lower values of meq, indicating
that two-body interactions have been more eﬀective in estab-
lishing a higher degree of partial energy equipartition, since
they have been acting for more relaxation times. However,
a small dependence on the cluster age is still noticeable.

In the bottom panel of Fig. 6, we introduce the quantity

9 We use the core relaxation time since it provides a better de-
scription of the relaxation conditions for the central regions, in

contrast with the half-light relaxation time that represents an
average quantity suitable to describe the system globally.

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

nrel = Tage/Trc, with Tage the age of the cluster. This quan-
tity indicates the numbers of relaxation times that a clus-
ter has experienced, with higher nrel corresponding to more
relaxed stellar systems. A tight correlation is obtained for
meq−nrel, indicating clearly that the establishment of energy
equipartition depends on the units of relaxation time expe-
rienced by a cluster. Interestingly, clusters with nrel > 20
seem to reach an asymptotic maximum value of degree of
equipartition, characterized by meq (cid:39) 1.5 M(cid:12). These clus-
ters have log Trc < 8.5, and are usually referred to as relaxed
globular clusters, according to the classiﬁcation of Zocchi
et al. (2012). A further discussion of the implications of the
meq − nrel is presented in Sect. 5.

5 THE DYNAMICAL STATE OF A CLUSTER

We have shown that the degree of partial equipartition pri-
marily correlates with the relaxation condition of the clus-
ters (number of relaxation times that a cluster has expe-
rienced). Additionally, a dependence on concentration and
age is also visible.

The cluster simulations used in this work are all ini-
tialized with the same tidal cut-oﬀ that sets them into a
relatively isolated initial condition, suitable for halo clusters
at 9-10 kpc from the Galactic Center (see Downing et al.
2010 for details). Moreover, note that the simulations did
not undergo core collapse. Our work therefore does not take
into consideration such a particularly complex phase of star
clusters dynamical evolution. However, the homogeneity of
our set of simulations still allows us to investigate the fun-
damental eﬀects that are solely connected to the internal
dynamical processes.

Here, we focus primarily on the implications of the cor-
relation between the relaxation condition of the cluster and
the degree of energy equipartition. In fact, this is a more
sound relation between two well connected internal dynam-
ical properties of the clusters. It provides also a straightfor-
ward interpretation: more relaxed clusters have reached a
higher degree of partial energy equipartition.

This relation can provide a fundamental tool to mea-
sure the relaxation condition of a cluster. Relaxation time,
as used in this work, is a quantity accessible observationally
from solely photometric quantities and it is already avail-
able for MW GCs (Harris 2010). The degree of partial energy
equipartition can be eﬃciently determined using the param-
eter meq of the ﬁtting function deﬁned in Eq. 3, applied to
a combination of line-of-sight velocities and state-of-the-art
HST proper motion data sets.
We ﬁt a power-law to the meq − nrel relation in the

rel
and the corresponding inverse function
nrel = 5.28 ± 1.35 (meq − 1.55 ± 0.23)

(7)
Given the meq − nrel relation, with a measure of neq =
Tage/Trc is possible to predict the meq parameter, hence the
mass dependence of the kinematics for a given globular clus-
ter. In this way, the meq − nrel relation can be used to pre-
dict the dynamics of dark stellar remnants or of other stars

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

for which the kinematics are not easily available (see Bald-
win et al. sub for an application to blue straggler stars, and
Bianchini et al. sub for binary stars). This is fundamental
since it can allow to carry out a complete dynamical analysis
without neglecting the eﬀect of partial energy equipartition
and mass dependent kinematics. In addition, it oﬀers a ref-
erence framework for a direct comparison with multi-mass
modeling techniques (e.g., Gieles & Zocchi 2015). Interest-
ingly, Gieles & Zocchi (2015) also ﬁnd a correlation between
the degree of energy equipartition and concentration (de-
ﬁned as the central depth of the potential) for their recently
developed multi-mass distribution function models (see ﬁrst
panel Fig.6 and Appendix).

Inversely, with a kinematic measure of meq, one can
predict the nrel for a given cluster and therefore character-
ize its relaxation condition and provide a dynamical age,
indicating at which stage of evolution the system is. There-
fore, the correlation between energy equipartition and re-
laxation time found here oﬀers an additional dynamical age
estimator to be added to those introduced in the literature.
In particular, Ferraro et al. (2012) introduced a dynamical
clock calibrated on the radial distribution of blue stragglers
stars. This is based on the fact that the radial distribution
of blue stragglers stars is determined by mass segregation
(as a consequence of two-body relaxation leading to partial
energy equipartition) and therefore it depends on the dy-
namical age of the cluster. Our approach, purely based on
kinematics, allows one to look at the same problem from an
independent and complimentary perspective.

Finally, the relations shown in this work can potentially
be used as a tool to highlight the complexity of the evolu-
tionary path of a cluster. In fact, any deviations from the
tight meq−nrel relation determined here for the non-rotating
quasi-isolated clusters, could be used to infer a complex dy-
namical evolution of a particular cluster, highlighting for ex-
ample post-core collapse clusters, presence of intermediate-
mass black holes, clusters with a peculiar orbit around the
MW, accretion vs. in-situ formation, or other peculiar for-
mation environments (e.g., nucleus of dwarf galaxies). In
parallel, also the relation between degree of equipartition
and concentration (ﬁrst panel Fig. 6) can be used to single
out complex evolutionary paths.

6 CONCLUSIONS
Two-body interactions shape the internal structure and dy-
namics of globular clusters over their long-term evolution,
bringing the systems in a state of partial energy equipar-
tition characterized by mass-dependent kinematics. In this
work, we introduced a novel approach to characterize the de-
gree of partial energy equipartition reached by GCs suitable
for both simulations and observations, and we investigated
its correlation with GCs properties.

We analyzed a set of Monte Carlo cluster simulations
spanning a large range of concentrations and binary frac-
tions, and considered them at the same time-snapshots (in
line with the MW GC system which is characterized by co-
eval clusters). For these simulations, we constructed the pro-
jected σ(m) proﬁle, describing the mass-dependence of the
velocity dispersion, in the region within the half-light radius.
We summarize our ﬁndings here.

P. Bianchini et al.

• Diﬀerent stellar objects (single stars, binary stars, stel-
lar remnants) follow the same σ(m) proﬁle, with the excep-
tion of recently formed white dwarfs that underwent rapid
severe mass loss. These white dwarfs are characterized by
lower velocity dispersion than the one expected for their
current mass.
• Fitting function for mass-dependent kinematics. We in-
troduce a simple exponential ﬁtting function able to match
the mass dependence of the velocity dispersion in the entire
stellar mass range sampled. This function is able to repro-
duce the ﬂattening of the slope of the σ(m) proﬁle towards
low stellar masses and the steepening at the higher-mass
regime. The ﬁtted parameter is the mass parameter meq
that is physically well motivated as it indicates the degree
of partial equipartition reached by the cluster. For m ≥ meq
the slope of the function corresponds to that of full energy
equipartition; while for m < meq only partial equipartition is
achieved. The exponential ﬁtting function provides excellent
ﬁts to the mass-dependent kinematics of our simulations,
showing that the systems are only in partial energy equipar-
tition. Note that our function can be considered an extension
of the commonly used power-law function σ ∝ m−η that is
instead only valid for restricted mass ranges.
• Applicability to observations. We tested our ﬁtting func-
tion on diﬀerent mass ranges. Using a discrete ﬁtting tech-
nique, we showed that, even for the restricted mass range
0.4 − 1.0 M(cid:12) accessible from state-of-the-art observations
from combination of HST proper motions and line-of-sight
velocities, it is still possible to reliably characterize the de-
gree of partial equipartition with the parameter meq. This
indicates that, once the σ(m) proﬁle is characterized, it can
be used to predict the mass dependence of kinematics also
for the non-observable low-mass regime and stellar remnant
mass regime (see Baldwin et al. sub for an application to
blue straggler stars). This will be particularly useful to carry
out comprehensive dynamical modeling for those clusters for
which the kinematics is restricted to only a limited stellar
mass range.
• Measuring the dynamical state of a cluster. We looked
for correlations of the degree of energy equipartition given
by the parameter meq with diﬀerent cluster properties. In
particular, we ﬁnd that more concentrated clusters are closer
to energy equipartition than less concentrated ones and that
younger clusters are further away from energy equipartition
than older ones. We showed that these relations are due to
the correlation of the degree of energy equipartition with
the relaxation state of the cluster, which we quantiﬁed by
neq = Tage/Trc with Tage the age of the cluster and Trc the
current core relaxation time. The tight relation obtained for
meq − nrel can serve as a tool to investigate the dynami-
cal condition of a GC. In fact, given a relaxation state of
a cluster (easily accessible from photometric quantities), it
is possible to predict the meq parameter, and therefore the
mass-dependence of the kinematics. Vice versa, measuring
the equipartition parameter meq from kinematics, it is pos-
sible to retrieve the internal dynamical state of a cluster.
Finally, the validity of this relation is restricted to quasi-
isolated clusters, so that any deviations from it could poten-
tially be used as a simple tool to unveil a peculiar dynamical
history of a given cluster (e.g., post-core collapse, presence
of intermediate-mass black hole, disk shocking, in situ vs.
accreted formation, peculiar formation environments). We

plan to undertake a speciﬁc analysis in order to quantify
these eﬀects in a follow up work.

A natural consequence of energy equipartition is the
sinking of massive stars into the central regions of a clus-
ters (mass segregation). This causes a radial variation of the
mass-to-light ratio, M/L, in a cluster. We therefore antici-
pate a dependence of M/L on the dynamical state of a clus-
ter and hence on its degree of energy equipartition. We will
address this point further in a forthcoming paper. Finally,
we point out that the approach introduced in this work to
describe energy equipartition in GCs can serve as an optimal
tool not only to characterize simulations and state-of-the-art
kinematic observations, but also for testing dynamical mod-
els in which multi-mass components (i.e., a realistic mass
function) are taken into consideration (e.g. Gieles & Zocchi
2015).

is the dimensionless mass of component j, and its normal-
ization is given by the central density weighted mean-mass

wise deﬁnition of the modiﬁed lowered incomplete Gamma
function, introduced by Gomez-Leyton & Velazquez (2014)
(see also Eq. (2) and App. D1 of GZ15). The parameter g
sets the continuity properties of the truncation prescription
of the distribution function (see Eq. (1) of GZ15), in such a
way that, in the isotropic limit, g = 0, 1, 2 correspond to the
usual Woolley (1954), King (1966), and non-rotating Wilson
(1975) multi-mass models, respectively. Finally, the param-

By considering the regime µj (cid:28) 1 (i.e., mj (cid:28) ¯m), the
asymptotic behavior of the function indicated in Eq. (A1)
can be easily calculated up to the order O(µ4δ

the limit µj → 0, the central velocity dispersion (for a

which is the ﬁrst terms of a Taylor expansion of σ =
σ0 exp(−1/2 m/meq)
Similarly, by considering the regime µj (cid:29) 1 (i.e.,
mj (cid:29) ¯m), the asymptotic behavior of the function indi-
cated in Eq. (A1) is simply given by ˆσ1d j 0 ∼ 1/µδ
j. For the
typical value δ = 1/2, this corresponds to the traditional
scaling ˆσ1d j 0 ∼ m
(see also Sect. 3.2.1 of GZ15), with
a coeﬃcient, ¯m1/2, which is, once again, a function of the
central concentration alone (for a chosen value of the param-
eter g). Such a behavior motivates the piecewise deﬁnition
of our ﬁtting function in the regime of higher masses (i.e.,
m (cid:29) meq).

APPENDIX

The exponential ﬁtting function proposed in Sect. 3.1 is
physically motivated by two asymptotic behaviours of the
central value of the velocity dispersion proﬁle σ(m),
in
the limit of low and high mass, respectively. Such behav-
iors can be studied in detail by taking advantage of the
analytical framework provided by appropriate distribution
function-based equilibria. Previous dynamical studies have
indeed showed that multi-mass, lowered isothermal models
(e.g., Woolley 1954; King 1966; Wilson 1975, and more re-
cently Gomez-Leyton & Velazquez 2014; Gieles & Zocchi
2015, hereafter GZ15) oﬀer a successful description of Galac-
tic globular clusters, even in diﬀerent relaxation conditions
(e.g., see Da Costa & Freeman 1976; Gunn & Griﬃn 1979;
Meylan 1987; Sollima et al. 2012). These equilibria are char-
acterized by multiple mass components, which are tradition-
ally deﬁned in terms of a set of relations between the veloc-
ity scales sj and the masses mj of the diﬀerent components,
such that mj s2
i . As previously noted (Merritt 1981;
Miocchi 2006, GZ15), we emphasize that such a prescription
does not enforce a condition of full energy equipartition in
the resulting conﬁgurations, neither locally nor globally.

j = mi s2

This class of models allow us to derive the velocity dis-
persion proﬁle in closed analytical form (i.e., as a function
of the potential), which may be expressed in terms of appro-
priate special functions. For the reader’s convenience, here
we will adopt the same notation used by Gieles & Zocchi
(2015), in which the central value of the dimensionless ve-
locity dispersion of the component j is given by:
