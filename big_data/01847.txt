Abstract

Using ﬁrst-principle calculations, we demonstrate several approaches to manipulate the

Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI) in ultrathin magnetic ﬁlms. First, we ﬁnd that DMI

is signiﬁcantly enhanced when the ferromagnetic (FM) layer is between nonmagnetic (NM)

layers inducing additive DMI in NM/FM/NM structures. For instance, as Pt and Ir below Co

induce DMI of opposite chirality, inserting Co between Pt below and Ir above in Pt/Co/Ir tri-

layers enhances the DMI of Pt/Co bilayers by 15%. Furthermore, in case of Pt/Co/Pb trilayers

(Pt/Co/Fe/Ir multilayers), the DMI can be enhanced by 50% (almost doubled) compared to

Pt/Co bilayers reaching a very large DMI amplitude of 3.2 meV/atom. Our second approach

for enhancing the DMI is to use oxide capping layer. We show that the DMI is enhanced by

60% in Pt/Co/Oxide structures as compared to Pt/Co bilayers. Finally, we demonstrate that

the DMI amplitude can be modulated using an electric ﬁeld and that its efﬁciency factor is

comparable to that of the electric ﬁeld control of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in transi-

tion metal/oxide interfaces. These approaches of DMI tuning pave the way for skyrmion and

domain wall motion-based spintronic applications.

The possibility to manipulate magnetization at nanoscale using the coupling between elec-

tron’s spin and its orbital angular momentum has led to the emergence of a new research ﬁeld

named "spin-orbitronics". A fascinating example of the impact of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC)

on the magnetization proﬁle is the chiral spiral or skyrmion magnetic orders observed at the surface

of ultrathin magnetic ﬁlms.1–10 Such spin conﬁgurations are governed by an additional exchange

interaction mechanism called Dzyaloshinskii-Moryia interaction (DMI)11–21 induced by SOC in

magnetic materials lacking inversion symmetry including interfaces between ferromagnetic (FM)

and heavy nonmagnetic (NM) metals.21,22 Furthermore, novel out-of-equilibrium spin transport

phenomena arise in such structures, notably spin-orbit torques (SOT) exerted on the magnetization

when injecting a current, leading to fast current-induced domain wall motion and magnetization

reversal.9,23–27 This has led to a new concept of magnetic storage devices, i.e. skyrmions-based

memory, where the information is coded by nanometer scale magnetic skyrmions in nanotracks

and manipulated using current pulses.22,28,29 However, in order to obtain higher information stor-

age density for applications it is critical to reduce skyrmions radius, which requires large DMI.

Furthermore, the velocity of domain wall motion is also shown to be strongly dependent on DMI

strength. Thus, ﬁnding efﬁcient material combinations giving rise to a large DMI is the key to

realize skyrmions and fast domain wall motion based spin-orbitronic devices.

In this Letter, we propose several approaches to enhance DMI in ultrathin magnetic ﬁlms.

First, it is shown that the DMI can be magniﬁed via multilayer stacking of FM and NM metals,

an approach proven to be a powerful tool in spintronics to engineer device transport and mag-

netic properties.16,30–32 The key ingredient for DMI enhancement is to chose FM and NM material

2

combinations possessing the required DMI chiralities for additive effects at successive FM/NM

interfaces. Our ﬁrst approach to enhance the DMI amplitude is thus to consider asymmetric tri-

layers such as Pt/Co/Ir trilayers, where the DMI at both Pt/Co and Ir/Co interfaces add up due to

the opposite sign of the DMI (Fig. 1) resulting in an overall enhanced anticlockwise DMI. Next

approach we propose is based on adding an oxidized capping layer, such as MgO, on top of a Pt/Co

bilayer, which is shown to efﬁciently enhance the DMI. Finally, we demonstrate that similarly to

the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), the DMI can be altered using an electric ﬁeld (EF).

This suggests a possibility of simultaneous control both the DMI and PMA via the electric ﬁeld

which opens an efﬁcient route towards EF-manipulation of magnetic skyrmions.

To calculate DMI, we employ the same approach as in our previous work33 based on the Vienna

ab initio simulation package (VASP),34,35 which represent an adaptation to the case of layered

structures of the method used for DMI calculations in bulk frustrated systems and insulating chiral-

lattice magnets.36,37 The electron-core interactions are described by the projected augmented wave

(PAW) method for the pseudopotentials with exchange correlation energy calculated within the

generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) form.38 The

cutoff energies for the plane wave basis set used to expand the Kohn-Sham orbitals were chosen to

be 320 eV and 500 eV for structures comprising only metals and those with oxygen, respectively.
The Monkhorst-Pack scheme was used for the Γ-centered 4×16×1 k-point sampling.

Our DMI strength parameter d is derived from the energy difference between clockwise and

anticlockwise magnetic spiral conﬁgurations by identifying this difference with what can be ex-

pected from an analytical expression of pair DMIs for the atoms in a single Co atomic layer.33 This

d given in eV per atom can be seen as the coefﬁcient of pair DMIs concentrated in a single atomic

layer and producing an equivalent effect.33 The calculation of d has been performed in three steps.

First, structural relaxations were performed until the forces become smaller than 0.001 eV/Å for

determining the most stable interfacial geometries. Next, the Kohn-Sham equations were solved,

with no SOC, to ﬁnd out the charge distribution of the system’s ground state. Finally, SOC was

included and the self-consistent total energy of the system was determined as a function of the

In order to design metallic trilayers with efﬁciently enhanced DMI, we ﬁrst systematically

investigated DMI in FM/NM bilayers. The calculated results are summarized in the upper panel

of Fig. 2. One can see that DMI chirality is anticlockwise (ACW) for Pt/Co bilayers while for Co

on Au, Ir, Pb and Al substrates, DMI shows a clockwise (CW) chirality. We note that the DMI

magnitude is much larger for Fe on top of Ir compared to Co on Ir case. Let us now combine two

interfaces of opposite DMI chiralities, e.g. Co/Pt and Co/Ir shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b), with reverse

possess ACW chirality. As summarized in the bottom panel of Fig. 2, the resulting DMI strength

for Pt/Co/NM trilayers is approximately equal to the sum of DMI amplitudes of two interfaces, i.e.

Pt/Co and Co/NM, constituting the trilayer structure. Here, again it demonstrates again that DMI

is very localized at interface.33

Due to small DMI amplitude at NM/Co interfaces in cases of NM=Al,Au,Ir, the DMI strength

in Pt/Co/NM trilayers is moderately enhanced (<15 %) compared to that of Pt/Co bilayer, 1.76

meV/atom. However, in the case of Pt/Co/Pb trilayer, the DMI enhancement can reach up to 2.65

meV/atom. This large enhancement is due to the high DMI value at the Pb/Co interface (0.493

meV/atom with CW chirality), as compared to that of Au/Co and Ir/Co interfaces. It is interesting

to note that the total DMI of Pt/Co/Pb structure, 2.65 meV/atom, is larger than the sum of the

DMI contributions from Pt/Co and Co/Pb bilayers, i.e. 1.76 meV/atom + 0.49 meV/atom = 2.25

meV/atom. This discrepancy is due to the DMI from 2nd and 3rd interface layer ,33 and the

inﬂuence of the electronic structure, especially the shifting of Fermi level in trilayers compared to

the corresponding bilayers. This deviation is also observed in other trilayers [Fig. 2].

Next, we consider a four layer Pt/Co/Fe/Ir structure which can be seen as replacing one mono-

layer of Co in Pt/Co/Ir trilayer by Fe. This is particularly interesting since a single layer of Fe on

Ir(111) possess very large DMI compared to that of Co on Ir [Fig. 2]. The calculated DMI for this

structure is shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 2. One can see that there is a signiﬁcant enhancement

for DMI in Pt/Co/Fe/Ir compared to that in Pt/Co/Ir with amplitude up to 3.23 meV/atom which is

1.8 times larger compared to that of Pt/Co.

In order to elucidate microscopic mechanisms of Fe induced DMI enhancement in this struc-
ture, we calculated the chirality-dependent SOC energy difference, (cid:52)ESOC, for both Pt3/Co3/Ir3
and Pt3/Co2/Fe/Ir3 as shown in Fig. 3. For the FM layer containing only three ML of Co (blue
bars), the dominant SOC energy source (cid:52)ESOC is located at the ﬁrst interfacial Pt layer, indicat-
ing large DMI in adjacent ferromagnetic Co1 layer.33 Whiles, the (cid:52)ESOC at the Co/Ir interface is
much smaller compared to that at the Pt/Co interface. However, when the adjacent Co to Ir layer

ing a large DMI at Fe layer. Thus, Pt/Co/Fe/Ir structure is much more efﬁcient than Pt/Co/Ir for

providing high DMI values.

tion of electric ﬁeld applied along normal orientation of the surface. Positive electric ﬁeld means
the electric ﬁeld is applied from metal to the insulator. The slope β indicated is for micromagetic
DMI.

Another approach to enhance DMI is to add an insulator (I) capping layer on top of FM/NM

to form FM/NM/I structure. These structures, notably Pt/Co/AlOx, Pt/Co/MgO or Ta/CoFe/MgO,

are of major interest for the manipulation of magnetization10,15,23–26,39 in domain walls, skyrmions

or nanomagnets via spin-orbit torques, where DMI is known to play an essential role in the magne-

tization reversal.27,40–42 In particular, DMI is expected to lead to a large decrease of the switching

prises 3 ML of Pt, 3 (to 5) ML of Co, and 2 ML of MgO with surface passivated by hydrogen as

shown in Fig. 4(a). The results show that DMI in Pt/Co/MgO is much larger, about 1.6 times, com-

pared to that in Pt/Co bilayers for the Co thicknesses considered from 3-5 MLs. It is shown that

when vary the thickness of Co layer from 3-5 MLs in both Pt/Co and Pt/Co/MgO structures, mi-

croscopic DMI d is not affected much suggesting that the Co/MgO interface affects almost equally

to the electronic structure of the Co layer up to at least 5 atomic layers [shown in Fig. 4(b)]. As for

the micromagnetic DMI constant D deﬁned according to Eq. 4 in Ref.33 is expected to decrease

with increasing Co thickness [Fig. 4]. The strong enhancement of DMI in Pt/Co/MgO has been

observed in experiments for 5 ML Co thickness case in ref.10, where the micromagnetic DMI from

experiment and ab initio are 2.0 and 2.3 mJ/m2, respectively.

Finally, we explore electric ﬁeld control of DMI in FM/NM/Oxide structures. Electric ﬁeld

control of interfacial magnetism, in particularly of PMA has been an intense interest.43–45 How-

ever there is no ﬁrst-principles study of electric ﬁeld control of DMI even though it has been

experimentally reported recently for the very small DMI case in Au/Fe/MgO multilayer.46 Here

we study the effect of an electric ﬁeld on the DMI in Pt/Co/MgO trilayers. We used 3 ML of Co

structure to calculate DMI as a function of external electric ﬁeld E (see Fig. 5). The electric ﬁeld

is applied perpendicularly to the plane of interface with positive voltage pointing from insulator

to metal. It is shown that for both microscopic DMI d and micromagnetic D, are approximately

linear-increasing as a function of E [Fig. 5]. Similarly to the electric ﬁeld control of the PMA,

the efﬁciency of the EF control of the DMI can be characterized by the the slope of the curve β

deﬁned as a ratio of the DMI change to E, which is found to be equal to 15.02 fJ/(Vm). Interest-

ingly, this parameter is comparable to the slope in electric ﬁeld control of PMA for Fe(Co)/MgO

structures,46–48 which unveils the possibility of simultaneous tuning of both PMA and DMI within

the same range suggesting a route towards an efﬁcient way for controlling skyrmions since they

depend on both the DMI and PMA.

In conclusion, we proposed three approaches for the efﬁcient tuning of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya

10

interaction (DMI). The ﬁrst one is to use Pt/FM/NM trilayers with inverse stacking of Pt/FM and

NM/FM structures with opposite DMI chiralities. This allows the enhancement of DMI up to 50%

as compared to the corresponding Pt/FM bilayers. Moreover, we demonstrated that in case of

Pt/Co/Fe/Ir multilayers a giant DMI values up to 3.2 meV/atom can be achieved, which is almost

twice of that for Pt/Co bilayers. The second approach is to cap Pt/Co structure with an oxidized

layer, which can cause a dramatic DMI enhancement. Finally, we demonstrated that DMI can

be controlled by the application of an electric ﬁeld in Pt/Co/MgO structure and showed that its

efﬁciency is comparable to E-ﬁeld control for PMA. These three very efﬁcient approaches pave

the way for engineering giant DMI for spintronic applications.
