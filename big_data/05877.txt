We present angle-dependent measurements of the eﬀective g-factor g(cid:63) in a Ge-Si core-shell
nanowire quantum dot. g(cid:63) is found to be maximum when the magnetic ﬁeld is pointing perpendic-
ular to both the nanowire and the electric ﬁeld induced by local gates. Alignment of the magnetic
ﬁeld with the electric ﬁeld reduces g(cid:63) signiﬁcantly. g(cid:63) is almost completely quenched when the
magnetic ﬁeld is aligned with the nanowire axis. These ﬁndings conﬁrm recent calculations, where
the obtained anisotropy is attributed to a Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction induced by heavy-
hole light-hole mixing. In principle, this facilitates manipulation of spin-orbit qubits by means of a
continuous high-frequency electric ﬁeld.

INTRODUCTION

GATE-DEFINED QUANTUM DOTS

Quantum computation [1–3] has made an enormous
leap from a far-fetched promise [4] to a realistic near-
future technology [5–7] during the past three decades.
Among others, spin systems in the solid state [8, 9] have
been developed into a mature but still very fast-evolving
research ﬁeld. In recent years increased research eﬀorts
have focused on C, Si, and Ge [10–12], which can be
puriﬁed to only consist of isotopes with zero nuclear spin
[13, 14] and thus exhibit exceptionally long spin lifetimes
[15, 16].

The one-dimensional character of electrostatically
deﬁned quantum dots in Ge-Si core-shell nanowires leads
to unique electronic properties in the valence band, where
heavy and light hole states are mixed [17–19]. The
band mixing gives rise to an enhanced Rashba-type spin-
orbit interaction [19], leading to strongly anisotropic and
electric-ﬁeld dependent g-factors [20]. This makes quan-
tum dots in Ge-Si core-shell nanowires promising candi-
dates for robust spin-orbit qubits that can be electrically
controlled via circuit quantum electrodynamics [21].

Despite these profound theoretical contributions,
only few experiments in Ge-Si core-shell nanowires have
been reported including Josephson junctions [22], spin-
ﬁlling [23], spin relaxation [24], spin coherence [25],
charge sensing [26] in the many-hole regime, and signa-
tures of weak antilocalization [27].

In this work we experimentally explore the an-iso-
tro-py of the g-factor in Ge-Si core-shell nanowires. We
electrostatically deﬁne a highly-tunable, elongated hole
quantum dot in the nanowire by means of local gates. We
measure the Zeeman splitting of a single-particle state in
the quantum dot while rotating the magnetic ﬁeld around
the high-symmetry axes of the system and ﬁnd a strong
anisotropy with respect to the nanowire as well as to the
electric ﬁeld, in line with theoretical predictions [20].

Our device in Fig. 1(a) consists of a p++-doped Si sub-
strate covered with 200 nm SiO2, on which six bottom
gates with 100 nm pitch are patterned with electron-
beam lithography (EBL). The gates are buried by 10 nm
Al2O3 grown with atomic layer deposition at 100◦C. A
single nanowire with a Si shell thickness of ∼2.5 nm and
a defect-free Ge core with a radius of ∼8 nm [28] is de-
terministically placed on top of the gate structure with
a micromanipulator and then contacted with ohmic con-
tacts made of 0.5/50 nm Ti/Pd. A source-drain bias
voltage VSD is applied to the source, the current I is
measured between the drain and ground. All measure-
ments are performed using dc electronic equipment in a
dilution refrigerator with a base temperature of 8 mK
and an eﬀective hole temperature of Thole ≈ 30 mK de-
termined by measuring the temperature dependence of
the Coulomb peak width [29, 30].

We use this gate design [31] to electrostatically de-
ﬁne a single quantum dot [31, 32]. The two barrier gates
g3 and g5 control the tunnel barriers, and a third plunger
gate g4 the electrochemical potential of the quantum dot.
In Fig. 1(c) we plot I versus the voltage on g4 Vg4. When
applying a high VSD = 50 mV we observe a strong sup-
pression of I for Vg4 > 2.5 V, indicating depletion of
the nanowire at Vg4 ≈ 2.5 V. At low VSD = 1 mV we
observe Coulomb peaks [32] with a regular spacing of
∆Vg4 ≈ 30 mV over a range of 2 V, i.e. we are able to
change the hole occupation of the quantum dot by more
than 60 holes. Above Vg4 ≈ 2 V no regular Coulomb
peaks are observed, but the high-bias gate sweep sug-
gests that the quantum dot is not completely emptied,
i.e. in this device we are unable to identify the last hole
on the quantum dot. If we assume the plunger gate cou-
pling to stay constant and the quantum dot to be empty
at Vg4 = 2.5 V, we can estimate the number of remaining
holes to be N ≈ 17 at Vg4 = 2 V. Reaching the single-hole

regime was not possible in our device.

A non-linear transport measurement is displayed in
Fig. 1(d). In this bias spectroscopy we plot the numer-
ical diﬀerential conductance dI/dV ≡ dI/dVSD vs. VSD
and Vg4, as will be in all the following bias spectroscopy
plots. Formation of a single quantum dot is indicated by
regularly shaped, closing Coulomb diamonds [32]. The
height of the Coulomb diamonds indicates an addition
energy of Eadd ≈ 8 − 10 meV. The variations in Eadd
cannot be explained by an interacting second quantum
dot, which would lead to non-closing diamonds. Orbital
shell ﬁlling can cause the variations in Eadd [33, 34]. The
low number of residing holes (∼ 25-30) supports this rea-
soning.

The results in Fig. 1 show a highly tunable nanowire
device in which we intentionally deﬁne a very stable
quantum dot. We can control the number of holes in
the quantum dot over a wide range from approximately
85 down to approximately 17.

ZEEMAN SPLITTING OF THE ORBITAL

GROUND STATE

We now investigate the Zeeman splitting ∆EZ of the
spin-degenerate quantum dot states [35]. To determine
the g-factor with high accuracy, we choose a charge tran-
sition where the onset of conductance is suﬃciently sep-
arated from other lines of increased conductance corre-
sponding to, e.g., (orbital) excited states of the quantum
dot, or resonances due to the low dimensionality of the
leads [36]. In Fig. 2(a) we show a bias spectroscopy of
such a charge transition together with the two Coulomb
diamonds adjacent to it. The number of residing holes
here is approximately 35, again estimated by comparing
the current plunger gate voltage (Vg4 ≈ 1450 mV) to the
depletion voltage at high bias (Vg4 ≈ 2.5 − 2.7 V).

We keep the plunger-gate voltage at Vg4 =
1454.0 mV and sweep VSD along the green line in Fig. 2(a)

rent [Fig. 2(b)]. The magnetic ﬁeld here is applied in
the plane of the chip perpendicular to the nanowire axis.
At B = 0, one very pronounced peak marks the onset
of conductance, which splits up into a spin-ground and
spin-excited state at ﬁnite magnetic ﬁelds. Note that the
shifts of the two states are symmetric and linear up to at
least 2 T, indicating that for magnetic ﬁelds B < 2 T
the linear Zeeman splitting is the only relevant term,
and other eﬀects, such as a diamagnetic shift [37, 38],
are negligible. The spin splitting of the orbital ground
state is further conﬁrmed by the two bias spectroscopies
in Fig. 2(d) at B = 0 and B = 1 T. The spin-degenerate
orbital ground state of the charge transition at B = 0
[indicated by a single green arrow Fig. 2(d)] is clearly
split into two lines at B = 1 T (indicated by two green
arrows).
We extract the Zeeman splitting ∆EZ by converting
the VSD scale into energy. The lever arm α ≡ Ctot-S/Ctot
with Ctot-S = Ctot − CS, where Ctot is the total ca-
pacitance of the dot, and CS is the source capacitance)
for this conversion is graphically extracted: the slopes
of the Coulomb diamond edges from Fig. 2(a) are a ≡
| − CG/(C − CS)| = 2.94 and b ≡ CG/CS = 0.44, where
CG is the gate capacitance [35]. By using α = 1/(1+b/a)
we ﬁnd a lever arm of α = 0.87. The linear increase of
∆EZ with increasing B is shown in Fig. 2(c). We ﬁt the
slope of ∆EZ according to ∆EZ = g(cid:63)µBB, where g(cid:63) is
the eﬀective g-factor, and µB is the Bohr magneton [see
Fig. 2(c)]. This yields an eﬀective g-factor for this tran-
sition of g(cid:63) = 2.7± 0.1. We point out that the spin states
are mixtures of heavy and light hole states and therefore
ms (cid:54)= 1/2, which is accounted for by the introduction of
g(cid:63) as an eﬀective g-factor. Note that g(cid:63) may diﬀer signif-
icantly from transition to transition due to the varying
heavy-hole light-hole mixing of subbands and quantum
dot states [19] at the valence band edge of the nanowire
[21, 23].
In summary, in Fig. 2 we determine the eﬀective g-
factor g(cid:63) to be g(cid:63) = 2.7 ± 0.1 for an in-plane magnetic
ﬁeld perpendicular to the nanowire. The corresponding
Zeeman splitting is symmetric and linear up to at least
2 T.

G-FACTOR ANISOTROPY

To investigate the anisotropy of the g-factor, we mea-
sure the Zeeman splitting of the ground state at a ﬁxed
magnetic ﬁeld magnitude of B ≡ | (cid:126)B| = 1 T while chang-
ing the direction of (cid:126)B. We choose the coordinate system
in accordance with Maier et al. [20], i.e. the z-axis points
along the nanowire axis, the x-axis points out of the chip
plane parallel to the electric ﬁeld produced by the bot-
tom gates, and the y-axis is in plane with the chip and
perpendicular to the nanowire [see Fig 3(a)]. We will

3

show measurements in three orthogonal rotation planes.
Within each plane, a full 2π-rotation of (cid:126)B is performed
in steps of π/36. For each step, I is measured vs. VSD
along the blue line in Fig. 2(d). The values for ∆EZ
along the diﬀerent directions are obtained by ﬁtting the
line cuts with two peaks for the spin-ground and spin-
excited states and calculating the distance between the
two peak centers.

First we rotate the magnetic ﬁeld from the y-axis to
the z-axis [Fig. 3(a)]. At φ1 = 0, the Zeeman splitting
of ∆EZ,y = 155 ± 5 µeV corresponds to a g-factor of
y = 2.7 ± 0.1 [in agreement with Fig. 2(c)]. The Zee-
g(cid:63)
man splitting decreases when the magnetic ﬁeld is rotated
towards the nanowire axis, until it is almost completely
quenched at φ1 = π/2 with ∆EZ,z = (13±10) µeV, corre-
z = 0.2 ± 0.2. For the magnetic ﬁeld along
sponding to g(cid:63)
the z-axis φ1 = −π/2 the peak is approximately twice
as high and also signiﬁcantly broadened compared to the
φ1 = −π peak. This indicates that here the Zeeman split-
ting is too small for the two peaks of the spin-excited and
spin-ground state to be resolved. However, the broad-
ened peak can be ﬁtted very well with two peaks that
have approximately the height and width of the peak for
the spin-ground state measured along the y-axis. This
provides further conﬁrmation that the broadened peak is
indeed a superposition of two separate peaks.

For the second measurement (cid:126)B always points in a
direction perpendicular to the nanowire and is rotated
from the y axis at φ2 = 0 (the same ﬁeld direction as for
φ1 = 0 in Fig 3(a) to the x axis at φ2 = π/2. Along the y
axis, the Zeeman splitting is again ∆EZ,y = 154± 5 µeV.
The Zeeman splitting decreases until it reaches ∆EZ,x =
120 ± 10 µeV along the x-axis, which corresponds to a
x = 2.1± 0.2. In Fig. 3(e) two line cuts from
g-factor of g(cid:63)
Fig. 3(b) along the y-axis (red curve) and the x-axis (blue
curve) are presented along with the ﬁtted curves that
were used to calculate ∆EZ.

The third rotation plane is the x-z plane, with φ3 =
0 pointing along the x-axis, and φ3 = π/2 along the z-
axis [see Fig. 3(c)]. At φ3 = 0 we measure a spin splitting
of ∆EZ,x = 117 ± 10 µeV, corresponding to a g-factor of
x = 2.0 ± 0.2. Rotation of (cid:126)B towards the z axis again
g(cid:63)
results in a Zeeman splitting of ∆EZ,z = 17 ± 10 µeV,
corresponding to g(cid:63)

z = 0.3 ± 0.2.

Combining the three rotation experiments, the Zee-
man splitting along each of the x, y, and z axes is mea-
sured twice with consistent values across experiments for
the eﬀective g-factor. Thus we can summarize our ﬁnd-
ings in Fig. 3(f).

Let us now compare our ﬁndings with experimental
and theoretical results from the literature. An anisotropy
of the eﬀective g-factor has been measured in other sys-
tems like Si nanowire metal-oxide-semiconductor ﬁeld-

the one-dimensional conﬁnement as well as the pro-
nounced strain of our nanowires. None of the reported
anisotropies has been attributed to tunable electric ﬁelds,
min ≈ 1.4 for rotation with respect
where we ﬁnd g(cid:63)
to the E-ﬁeld axis. For Ge/Si core-shell nanowires, Hu et
al. [24] reported an eﬀective g-factor of g(cid:63) ≈ 1.02 mea-
sured with the B-ﬁeld aligned along the nanowire axis
0 ± 30◦. Roddaro et al.
[23] have measured g(cid:63) for dif-
ferent transitions ranging from 1.6 to 2.2, (cid:126)B was here
aligned perpendicular to the nanowire. Both values are
consistent with our measurements.

max/g(cid:63)

A g-factor anisotropy can in principle be related
to the crystal direction [43].
In our probably <110>-
oriented device, we have observed a diﬀerent anisotropy
for holes states most probably originating from higher

subbands, while we have observed qualitatively the same
anisotropy in a second device tuned to the few-hole
regime. Therefore we have strong evidence that the
g-factor anisotropy observed here is rather related to
an electric-ﬁeld induced mixing between the lowest-lying
subbands as discussed in the following paragraph.

Maier et al.

[20] theoretically investigated the g-
factor in Ge-Si core-shell nanowires. They assumed elon-
rcore (cid:28) ldot, which is very
gated quantum dots, i.e.
well fulﬁlled in our device, where rcore ≈ 8 nm and
ldot ≈ 150 nm. They predicted the g-factor to be highly
anisotropic, with g indeed being quenched along the
nanowire axis, and a maximum g-factor perpendicular
to the nanowire. This is in excellent agreement with our
measurements. Moreover, they predicted a lower g-factor
at ﬁnite electric ﬁelds. In particular, their calculations
showed a more eﬀective diminishment for (cid:126)B (cid:107) (cid:126)E than for
(cid:126)B ⊥ (cid:126)E. Also this agrees well with our ﬁndings. Maier
et al. show that this tunability of the g-factor with elec-
tric ﬁelds is caused by the eﬀective coupling of diﬀer-

heavy-hole light-hole nature of the individual subbands.
The combination leads to a very pronounced spin-orbit
interaction (SOI) introduced as the ‘direct Rashba spin-
orbit interaction’ [19] because of its resemblance of the
standard Rashba SOI and the fact that it is a leading-
order process not suppressed by the band gap and thus
expected to be 10-100 times stronger than the standard
Rashba SOI for geometries similar to our device.

Also quantitatively our measurements agree very
well with the predictions regarding the g-factor quench-
ing along the nanowire axis. The g-factor suppression
by the electric ﬁeld is less pronounced than the calcula-
tions. This can be explained by diﬀerences in the exact
geometry of the wires, the quantum dot not being in the
single-hole regime, and the fact that our device is oper-
ated at signiﬁcantly higher electric ﬁelds than assumed
by Maier et al.

Let us now brieﬂy discuss the implications of these
results for quantum computation applications. A main
obstacle for spin-based qubits is the fast coherent manip-
ulation of the spin state. In principle this can be done
with a pulsed high-frequency (HF) magnetic ﬁeld, but
this is technologically very challenging. Our results im-
ply that it is not only possible to use pulsed HF electric
ﬁelds as also used in other systems with signiﬁcant SOI
[44, 45], but with continuous HF electric ﬁelds while tun-
ing the qubit in and out of resonance by changing the
static electric ﬁeld, e. g., through a combination of top
and bottom gates.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have demonstrated control over the
hole occupancy in a Ge-Si core-shell nanowire quantum
dot over 60 charge transitions. The eﬀective g-factor has
been found to be highly anisotropic with respect not only
to the nanowire axis but also the electric-ﬁeld direction.
In particular we have found excellent qualitative agree-
ment between our measurements and theoretical calcula-
tions [20]. This opens the way to controlled manipulation
of the spin-state with a continuous high-frequency elec-
tric ﬁeld, a major technological advancement.
