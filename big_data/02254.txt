Abstract

It is shown that large chemical potential leads to the signiﬁcant increase of multiplicity ﬂuctuations

for bosons, and makes the ﬂuctuations inﬁnite in the case of Bose-Einstein condensation. It allows to

distinguish between the models that explain the anomalous proton to pion ratio and the low transverse

momentum enhancement of pion spectra in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC within chemical equilibrium

or non-equilibrium models. The eﬀects of resonance decays, ﬁnite size of the system, requirements to

the event statistics, diﬀerent momentum cuts, and limited detector acceptance are considered. The

obtained results show the possibility to observe a substantial increase of the normalized kurtosis for

positively or negatively charged pions in the case of non-equilibrium or partial pion condensation using

currently measured data.

INTRODUCTION

During last decades thermal model [1–10] (TM) became a standard tool for the analysis

of nucleus-nucleus collisions.

It is implemented in free online codes [11–13], and obtained

temperatures are discussed as a basic property of a created system in the papers reporting

experimental results, see e.g. [14, 15]. The temperatures follow a smooth freeze-out line in a

wide energy range of colliding nuclei [16, 17]. The initial energy of the collision is 10 times larger

at the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) than at RHIC (Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider) and 100

times larger than at SPS (Super Proton Synchrotron). The temperature grows with increasing
energy of the collision, and was expected to saturate around T (cid:39) 165 MeV. Therefore, the LHC
data [14, 18] came as a big surprise, because their description requires that the temperature

falls down from the freeze-out line by 10 MeV [15, 19], being smaller than at RHIC and close

to that at the SPS1. This diﬀerence in temperature is very large for a TM, because all particles
except for pions have the mass m (cid:29) 165 MeV, and their mean multiplicities in TM depend
exponentially on temperature (cid:104)N(cid:105) ∼ exp[−m/T ].

Besides the lower temperature at the LHC, there are substantial diﬃculties in simultaneous

description of pions and protons. Proton to pion ratios are suppressed at the LHC compared to

RHIC [14]. Experimentally measured pion spectra at the LHC rise steeper for low transverse

momentum pT than in the models [22–24], while the same models work perfectly at RHIC.

There are many ways to explain the proton to pion ratio [25–29], but the low pT enhancement

of the pion spectrum at the LHC, is still the open problem.

Both, proton to pion ratio and the low pT pion spectrum can be explained in the non-

equilibrium TM [30, 31]. It allows for a non-equilibrium chemical potential2 for each particle,

due to partial equilibration of the constituent quarks in the fast expanding ﬁreball [32, 33].

This model has two more parameters compared to the standard TM - one for light and one

for strange quarks. The numerical calculations in the non-equilibrium TM give even smaller
temperature T (cid:39) 140 MeV, and the large positive chemical potential for pions close to it’s mass
µπ (cid:39) mπ [30], see also [34]. This may imply the Bose-Einstein condensation of pions [35–37].
The pion chemical potential was introduced to explain the early data at the SPS [38], and

1 The recent analysis of the new SPS data gives a diﬀerent freeze-out line, which points to the low LHC

temperature [20]. The same TM used for the LHC conﬁrms this ﬁnding [21].

2 The non-equilibrium can describe proton spectra as good as the rescattering [23], but only a non-equilibrium

chemical potential can give the low pT enhancement of pions seen in the data [31].

was similarly justiﬁed by partial thermalization [39], and also by pion condensation [40–42].

However the update of the resonance list gave the same eﬀect [5], and pion condensation was

abandoned. It seems not to be the case at the LHC, because the properties of the resonances

with m < 2.5 GeV are known very well now. They are already included in TM, and are not

enough to explain the proton-pion puzzle. The resonances with m > 2.5 will, probably, not

change the description due to their exponential suppression, as discussed above. The only

possible light meson candidate was the famous sigma f0(500) meson, but it should not be

included in TM at all [43–45].

There are good reasons for chemical non-equilibrium with µπ > 0 at the LHC. It was pre-

dicted in the super(over) cooling scenario [46, 47]. The extra pions at low pT may appear due

to fast hadronization of the gluon condensate [48, 49], glueballs [50], or Color Glass Conden-

sate [51, 52], forming transient Bose-Einstein condensate of pions [53]. The time needed to form
such a condensate at the LHC is lower than at RHIC, and is just t ∼ 0.1 − 0.2 fm/c [54, 55].
The analysis of two-, three- and four-particle correlations by ALICE Collaboration [56, 57] gives
large values for the amount of pions from a coherent source - 20 − 30%. They do not specify
the nature of the coherent emission, but pion condensate is a good candidate.

A large positive chemical potential substantially increases multiplicity ﬂuctuations of bosons

and makes the ﬂuctuations inﬁnite for the case of pion condensation in an inﬁnite system [58,
59]. At the LHC the radius of the system at freeze-out is r ∼ 10 fm [60], and the amount of
pions on the zero momentum (condensate) level is ∼ 5% [36]. However, it can be enough to
observe a detectable signal in pion multiplicity ﬂuctuations3, using currently measured events

by ALICE. If the ﬂuctuations will be found small, then it will be a strong argument against

non-equilibrium at the LHC. However, if the ﬂuctuations will be found large, then one could

use them as a tool to study the non-equilibrium.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section II the phase diagram of the pion gas is obtained

in order to determine the centrality where the largest amount of the condensate is possible at the

LHC. In Section II the ﬂuctuations of primary pions are calculated, and further suggestions how

to search for the condensate are formulated. In Section IV the resonance decay contribution,

requirements to event statistics, and the eﬀects of limited detector acceptance are considered.

A speciﬁc pT cut is proposed to enhance the eﬀect of possible pion condensation. Section V

3 The high order net-charge ﬂuctuations received a lot of attention recently, see e.g. [61–67], however, it seems
that pion ﬂuctuations with µπ (cid:29) 0 were not studied yet.

p. The critical density is deﬁned in TM as ρC(T ) = ρ(T, µ = m), that gives a continuous
condensation line in the T − ρ plane [59, 68]. Therefore, one can also ﬁnd the condensation
temperature TC for each density TC(ρ).

Multiplicity ﬂuctuations rise to inﬁnity at the condensation line in the inﬁnite volume

limit [59], and increase fast in it’s vicinity for a ﬁnite volume of the system [68]. Therefore

it is important to know how far the system is from the condensation line. The ﬁnite volume

corrections were implemented in [35] to SHARE model [13]. The corresponding ﬁt of the mid-

rapidity yields dNi

dy ||y|<0.5 at the LHC conﬁrms that chemical potential is relevant only for pions,

giving a smaller value than in [30]. In this model chemical potential is the same for charged

and neutral pions, so neutral pions could ’feel’ the condensation eﬀects at smaller µπ, due to

lower mass. However, their multiplicity is not measured yet, and the spectrum is available only

for pT > 700 MeV [69], while any eﬀect of the condensate on spectra can be seen for much

smaller momenta pT < 200 MeV [36]. Moreover, in order to address ﬂuctuations, the number

of particles should be measured event-by-event, which is even more complicated. The number

of positively and negatively charged pions is the same within the error bars [14], therefore
µπ+ (cid:39) µπ− ≡ µ and there is no diﬀerence which one to use. However, charge identiﬁcation is
important, because π+ and π− are diﬀerent particles that condense separately.

The densities and chemical potentials for positively or negatively charged pions are calculated

for diﬀerent centralities of the collision at the LHC, using the parameters obtained in [35], and

are shown in Fig. 1. One can see that ρ < ρC and T > TC at the LHC, so the condensate line

is not reached, but central and semi-central collisions with centrality c < 40% are the closest to
the condensation line. Note a small temperature for the most central collisions T (cid:39) 140 MeV
as in [30, 70], which increases for peripheral collisions and reaches the equilibrium TM result
of T (cid:39) 156 MeV [19, 20] for very peripheral collisions. The chemical potential decreases for

peripheral collisions in contrast to [30], because of the ﬁnite size of the system at freeze-out.

Therefore, the condensation is more probable in the most central collisions, where the system

is also spatially larger and lives longer.

The error bars are obtained using the standard methods for propagation of uncertainty. The

necessary correlations of the parameters are calculated for the 10% deviation of the χ2/Ndof from

the best ﬁt [36]. The correlation between all pairs of thermodynamic parameters is negative at

all centralities, except for the correlation between volume and temperature, which has a small
positive value at c = 60 − 80%. Therefore, the error bars are the largest at this centrality.

decrease this ambiguity.

III. FLUCTUATIONS OF PRIMARY PIONS

Multiplicity ﬂuctuations of any order can be calculated for primary pions analytically, using
the deﬁnition of susceptibilities χn. They are given by the derivatives of pressure P by chemical

For µ = 0 and m/T → ∞ one recovers the result for Boltzmann statistics with ω = S · σ =
κ · σ2 = 1. The µ = 0 and m/T → 0 is never realized in TM, because the temperatures
are usually of the order of the pion mass or lower. However, one can see that for this case
the scaled variance is ﬁnite, ω (cid:39) 1.368 [58], but S · σ and κ · σ2 diverge on the lower bound
of the momentum integral, that usually replaces the sum over the momentum levels in (6)-

p → V /(2π2)(cid:82) p2dp. For µ → m even ω diverges, as well as all (cid:82) p2dp(cid:104)np(cid:105)k with

k ≥ 2. This is the consequence of the fact that Bose-Einstein condensation is the 3rd order
phase transition5. However, there are no divergences in ﬁnite volume, because the maximal

ﬂuctuations are bounded by the number of particles in the system. One can take the ﬁnite

volume into account keeping the zero momentum state in the sum(cid:80)

term on the right hand side of Eq. (11) is larger for µ → m, because the largest contribution
to the integral comes from the lower bound p → 0, which diverges as (cid:104)n0(cid:105)k in this limit, but
the p2dp → 0 weakens the divergency. Therefore, at µ → m one can estimate the ﬂuctuations
assuming that there is only the condensate level p = 0. Keeping also only the highest k in

us also assume for simplicity that the condensation line is already reached, because it excludes
the ρ − ρC dependance. Then, δ = (aV )−2/3, where a = (mT )3/2/(

(13)

Therefore, the higher is the order of ﬂuctuations, the faster they grow.

Equations (11,12) suggest that the ﬂuctuations at µ → m should increase, if one ﬁnds a
way to increase the relative amount of registered particles on the p = 0 level. It can be done
by applying the pT cut that selects more pions from the condensate (cid:104)n0(cid:105). The pion spectra

at the LHC are measured starting from pT > 100 MeV. Pions on the p = 0 level can receive
a momentum pT (cid:46) 200 MeV, because of the collective motion with the hypersurface [36].
Therefore, three distinct cases can be considered:

- the easiest to calculate, but hard to measure,

• all pT
• pT > 100 MeV
• pT = 100 − 200 MeV - contais the highest percentage of pions from the p = 0 level.

- currently measured data,

Fluctuations of primary pions, both normal and those from the condensate, can be calculated

in Cracow single freeze-out model [73–76]. It can be done taking numerically the integral over

the hypersurface, and for the corresponding pT intervals ∆pnorm

per unit rapidity V = πr2

maxτf [60]. The integral over rapidity dy is absent in the right hand side
of Eq. (14), because the ﬁt of thermodynamic parameters was done for the rapidity densities

dNi

dy ||y|<0.5 [35, 36].
Another possibility to enhance the ﬂuctuations is the increase of volume6, as seen from

Eq. (13).

It can be done by increasing the rapidity interval where pions are measured.

It

should be noted that the same assumption as in [36] is made so far, that the coherence length

6 The rapidity distributions are ﬂat in the wide range of rapidities at the LHC. Thus, temperature and chemical

potentials should not change, while total volume increases with increasing the rapidity interval.

8

of the condensate in rapidity, ∆ycond, is the same as the rapidity interval of the measurements.

If ∆ycond is much larger, then one could use the approximate formula (19) from the next section.

If ∆ycond is smaller and ﬂuctuations of the condensate come from the uncorrelated parts of the

freeze-out hypersurface, or just from a small part of it, then the ﬂuctuations will be smaller
and scale diﬀerently from (13). In any case, the κ · σ2 observable seems to be sensitive enough
to study these eﬀects.

IV. RESONANCE DECAY CONTRIBUTION

The question about ﬂuctuations in a real system can be addressed semi-analytically under

the assumption that the system consists of two parts that do not correlate.

It seems to be

a reasonable approximation, because the corresponding ﬂuctuations are very diﬀerent. As we

will see, the ﬂuctuations of pions from resonance decays in small acceptance window in rapidity
are ∼ 1, as for Poisson distribution. At the same time, pion ﬂuctuations rapidly increase at
µ → m, see Eqs. (12)-(13).

For two uncorrelated multiplicity distributions P1(N1) and P2(N2) one has:

(cid:104)N(cid:105) = (cid:104)N1(cid:105) + (cid:104)N2(cid:105) ,

Therefore, one can calculate primary ﬂuctuations using Eqs. (6)-(9), (14) and then mix them

with the ﬂuctuations of pions from resonance decays using Eqs. (15)-(18).

The limited detector acceptance can be taken into account similar to Ref. [77]. In the limit

of a very small acceptance window one can neglect all correlations, use binomial distribution
for the probability q for a particle to be accepted, 0 (cid:54) q (cid:54) 1, q → 0, and obtain

ω = 1 + q (ωall − 1) ,

S · σ (cid:39) 1 + 2q (ωall − 1) ,

κ · σ2 (cid:39) 1 + 6q (ωall − 1) ,

(19)

where ωall is the scaled variance for the case when all particles are accepted. One can see

from Eq. (19) that for ωall > 1 the ﬂuctuations of the accepted particles are always larger

than unity and approach to it from above in the small acceptance limit7. Equation (19) is

7 Global conservation of charges, energy and momentum signiﬁcantly suppress ﬂuctuations making ωall < 1,

9

an approximation that should be valid for pions from resonance decays, but it is not valid if

there is some dependance on pT . For example, the relative amount of primary pions from the

condensate at p = 0 increases after the application of the cut with pT < 200 MeV, because

they are situated only there [36]. However, Eq. (19) is still useful, because it shows that the

increase of acceptance leads, ﬁrst of all, to the change of higher order ﬂuctuations.

The THERMINATOR model [76] is used for the account of resonances in this paper. Primary

particles are sampled with Poisson distribution there, i.e. ωprim = Sprim·σprim = κprim·σ2
It is not correct for primary pions, because their number should be sampled according to Bose-

Einstein distribution following Eqs. (6)-(9). However, it gives a good estimate of pion ﬂuc-

tuations due to resonance decays, because resonances are heavy, and one can use Boltzmann

statistic for them, see the discussion after Eq. (10). Resonance decays can only increase ﬂuc-

tuations in this case. The eﬀects of resonance decays are stronger for higher temperatures,

because of the exponential suppression of heavy particles in TM. The temperature is the high-
est at c = 60 − 80% centrality, see Fig. (1). Therefore, resonance decays at this centrality give
the upper bound on the ﬂuctuations from resonances at all centralities

Sres · σres (cid:46) 1.1,

(20)

Looking at the numerical values in Eq. (20) one can conclude that the scaling (19) holds even

quantitatively. Any pT cut further decreases the ﬂuctuations for resonances. Therefore, the
approximation ωres = Sres · σres = κres · σ2

res = 1 is used from here on.

Statistical errors increase extremely fast for normalized skewness and kurtosis when mean

multiplicity increases. Using the deﬁnitions for the absolute and relative errors of the unknown

variable X

one obtains for the mean multiplicity, scaled variance, normalized skewness and kurtosis [82]:

order to have a relative error for the normalized kurtosis on the level of εκ·σ2 = 10%, one has

see [77–80]. Therefore, in the case when global conservations start to play a role the ﬂuctuations approach
to unity from below [81].

to generate Nev = 24 ∗ 102 ∗ (cid:104)N(cid:105)2 events. For pions in the most central collisions at the LHC
it gives the number Nev ∼ 109. For smaller statistics one can obtain huge and even negative
values for S · σ and κ · σ2 which ﬂuctuate with Nev just because of small statistics.

The results of the calculations using Eq. (14) are substituted to Eqs. (6)-(9), then to

Eqs. (15)-(18), and are presented in Figs. 2-4. The scaled variances increase to some mild

values, which can be easily overridden by, e.g. volume (participant number) ﬂuctuations inside
of a given centrality [83, 84]. It seems that volume ﬂuctuations should inﬂuence S · σ and κ· σ2
much less than ω, because they depend mainly on (m − µ)/T . However, a precise answer to
this question requires a separate study, which is beyond the scope of this paper.

The normalized skewness is more sensitive variable that increases much more than the scaled
variance. The pT cut to ∆pT = 100−200 MeV gives a factor of 2 increase for the S·σ compared
to other cases. The normalized kurtosis reaches the values ∼ 100 even for the measured pT
range, while the ∆pT = 100 − 200 MeV further increases it three times to ∼ 300. The error
bars are not shown, because they depend mainly on the diﬀerence (m − µ)/T which is highly
uncertain, see Fig. 1. The scaling between the ﬂuctuations according to Eq. (13) holds for the
pT cut ∆pT = 100 − 200 MeV.

The eﬀect of cutting the pT range to ∆pT = 100 − 200 MeV gives much larger eﬀect than
measuring pions with all pT . It is an important advantage, because decreasing the pT requires

lower magnetic ﬁeld and re-calibration of the detectors [47], while a pT cut can be implied in

the currently used software for the analysis of the events.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The normalized kurtosis is the most sensitive to chemical non-equilibrium, pion condensa-

tion, and any other considered eﬀects. It requires the largest number of measured events, and

12

the knowledge of the tails of the multiplicity distribution. However, it rapidly grows if detector

acceptance, size of the system, or relative amount of particles in the condensate increases.

A similar increase of the normalized kurtosis can be produced by any other physical process

that leads to the appearance of a positive pion chemical potential. It may allow to distinguish

between equilibrium and non-equilibrium models at the LHC.

The cut of the transverse momentum pT = 100−200 MeV for positively (negatively) charged
pions allows to increase the relative amount of the condensate in the considered events, using

already measured data. The possible increase of the normalized kurtosis is so large, that one

can check the intriguing possibility of high temperature Bose-Einstein condensation of pions at

the LHC experimentally.
