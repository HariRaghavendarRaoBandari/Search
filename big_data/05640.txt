(Dated: March 18, 2016)

We have measured weak antilocalization eﬀects, universal conductance ﬂuctuations, and
Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in the two-dimensional electron gas formed in InGaAs/AlInAs het-
erostructures. This system possesses strong spin-orbit coupling and a high Land´e factor. Phase-
coherence lengths of 2−4 µm at 1.5−4.2 K are extracted from the magnetoconductance measure-
ments. The analysis of the coherence-sensitive data reveals that the temperature dependence of the
decoherence rate complies with the dephasing mechanism originating from electron-electron inter-
actions in all three experiments. Distinct beating patterns superimposed on the Aharonov-Bohm
oscillations are observed over a wide range of magnetic ﬁelds, up to 0.7 Tesla at the relatively
high temperature of 1.5 K. The possibility that these beats are due to the interplay between the
Aharonov-Bohm phase and the Berry one, diﬀerent for electrons of opposite spins in the presence
of strong spin-orbit and Zeeman interactions in ring geometries, is carefully investigated. It appears
that our data are not explained by this mechanism; rather, a few geometrically-diﬀerent electronic
paths within the ring’s width can account for the oscillations’ modulations.

INTRODUCTION

The electronic characteristic scale on which quantum
interference can occur in a mesoscopic sample is the
phase-coherence length Lφ. The study of decoherence
in quantum-mechanical systems has gained much inter-
est recently, because Lφ is relevant to spintronics, i.e.,
to spin-sensitive devices1–4 comprising materials with
strong spin-orbit interactions. The variation of Lφ with
the temperature T serves to indicate the main scattering
mechanism which limits phase coherence, be it electron-
electron, electron-phonon, or spin-dependent, scatter-
ing processes. At low temperatures, though, electron-
electron scattering is the dominant mechanism respon-
sible for dephasing. Theoretically, the dephasing rate,
1/τφ, due to this scattering vanishes linearly with T
as the temperature decreases towards zero,
in agree-
ment with the prediction of Altshuler et al.5 To de-
termine experimentally the relevant dephasing mecha-
nism and to estimate the coherence length, quantum-
interference properties, such as weak localization and
antilocalization,6,7 universal conductance ﬂuctuations,8
and Aharonov-Bohm oscillations,9–11 are measured and
analyzed. These quantum eﬀects have diﬀerent depen-
dencies on the coherence length; their combined study
provides a comprehensive picture of the processes lead-
ing to decoherence in weakly-disordered nanostructures.
Here we focus on nanostructures in which the elec-
trons are subjected to signiﬁcant spin-orbit coupling,
and report on studies of weak antilocalization (WAL)
eﬀects, universal conductance ﬂuctuations (UCF), and
Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations in the magnetoresis-
tance data of mesoscopic samples of InGaAs/AlInAs.
This material is well-known for its strong Rashba-type

spin-orbit interaction,12,13 characterized by the coupling
strength αso of about of 10−11eV m.14,15 This value cor-
responds to a spin-orbit energy16 ωso = (m∗vF/)αso ≈
1.6 meV (the Fermi wave vector of our samples is ≈
1.58 × 106 cm−1). The Land´e factor of our material is
about 15, and hence the Zeeman energy is ωZ ≈ 0.87×B
meV, where the magnetic ﬁeld B is measured in Tesla.

The spin-orbit interaction, coupling the momentum
of the electron to its spin, in conjunction with a Zee-
man ﬁeld gives rise to Berry phases.17 The simplest il-
lustration of a Berry phase occurs when a spin 1/2 fol-
lows adiabatically a magnetic ﬁeld whose direction varies
in space.18,19 When that direction returns to its initial
orientation the spin wave function acquires a geometri-
cal phase factor. A spatially-inhomogeneous magnetic
ﬁeld can be produced by the joint operation of spin-
orbit coupling and a Zeeman ﬁeld.16 Because the Berry
phase may modify periodicities related to the Aharonov-
Bohm eﬀect, it has been proposed that it can be detected
in persistent currents, magnetoconductance, and univer-
sal conductance ﬂuctuations of strongly spin-orbit cou-
pled mesoscopic systems.16,19–21 Speciﬁcally, the Berry
phase is expected to manifest itself in additional oscilla-
tions superimposed on the conventional Aharonov-Bohm
ones, leading to peak-splitting in the power spectrum
of those oscillations,18 i.e., to a beating pattern. Beat-
ing magnetoconductance oscillations have been indeed
reported22–27 for AB rings fabricated in materials with
strong spin-orbit interactions at temperatures below 500
mK. In comparison, our samples show beating patterns
at much more elevated temperatures.

However, one should exercise caution when adopting
the interpretation based on the eﬀect of Berry phases for
beating patterns superimposed on Aharonov-Bohm oscil-

lations. First, the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations appear at
arbitrarily small magnetic ﬁelds, while the eﬀect of the
Berry phase reaches its full extent only in the adiabatic
limit, realized when both ωZ and ωso are larger16,18,19
than the frequency of the electron rotation around the
ring. Second, the Berry geometrical phase is restricted to
the range {0, 2π}, limiting the corresponding geometrical
ﬂux to the order of one ﬂux quantum,19 which may make
it negligible as compared with the Aharonov-Bohm ﬂux.
Third, there can be other causes for the appearance of
beating patterns: a recent experimental study28 carried
on InGaAs/InAlAs mesoscopic rings reports on beating
patterns in the magnetoresistance as a function of the
magnetic ﬁeld, measured at temperatures up to 3 K. The
authors attribute these patterns to the interplay of a few,
geometrically-diﬀerent, closed paths that are created in
a ﬁnite-width ring.29 We carry out below a thorough at-
tempt to ﬁt our AB oscillations’ data to the theoretical
expressions predicting the beating patterns, in particular
the expressions given in Ref. 16. We ﬁnd that the theo-
retical expression for the transmission of a strongly spin-
orbit coupled Aharonov-Bohm ring does show a beating
pattern. However, it seems to be due to the Zeeman in-
teraction alone; the reason being the conﬁnement of the
Berry phase to the range {0, 2π} mentioned above. Our
conclusion is that, given the physical parameters of our
rings, the beating patterns we observe probably cannot
be attributed to the eﬀects of the Berry phase.

The remaining part of the paper is organized as fol-
lows. Section II describes the samples’ preparation and
the measurements techniques. Section III includes the
results of the measurements of the antilocalization ef-
fects (Sec. III A), the universal conductance ﬂuctuations
(Sec. III B), and the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations (Sec.
III C). In each subsection we list the values of the co-
herence length extracted from the data. In the last sub-
section there we combine the results of all measurements
to produce the dependence of the dephasing rate in our
samples on the temperature (Sec. III D), from which we
draw the conclusion that it is electron-electron scatter-
ing that dephases the interference in our InGaAs/AlInAs
heterostructures. Section IV presents our attempts to ex-
plain the beating pattern of the AB oscillations displayed
in Sec. III C. Our conclusions are summarized in Sec. V.

II. SAMPLES’ PREPARATION AND

MEASUREMENTS

Three types of samples were prepared, all compris-
ing a single basic material. The schematic drawing of
the layers in the InGaAs/AlInAs heterostructures used
in our studies is given in Fig. 1. This material was
grown by molecular-beam epitaxy, as described in detail
elsewhere.30,31 The geometrical shape of above-micron
devices was patterned by a conventional photolithogra-
phy, while that of the nanoscale ones were patterned
using e-beam lithography. About 1 micron deep mesa

was etched with phosphoric acid (of concentration 1:8) to
prevent as much as possible parasitic conduction in the
structure below the quantum well. Vacuum deposition
of a Au-Ge conventional alloy was used to form Ohmic
contacts. Electron density of 4.55 ×1011 cm−2 and elec-
tron mobility of 1.8 ×105 cm2/(V sec) were deduced from
resistivity and Hall-eﬀect measurements taken at 4.2 K.
Measuring each of the coherence eﬀects requires sam-
ples of diﬀerent geometry. We have used a 110 µm long
(i.e., the distance between the voltage probes) and 10 µm
wide Hall bar for the weak-localization studies, a shorter
Hall bar of length 8 µm and width 0.2 µm for the UCF
measurements, and two identically-prepared rings (de-
noted below by “A” and “B”), of average radius 0.75
µm, and average width 0.2 µm for the AB measure-
ments, see Fig. 2. The resistance was measured by the
four-terminal method, exploiting a low-noise analog lock-
in ampliﬁer (EG&GPR-124A) in perpendicularly-applied
magnetic ﬁelds up to 5 Tesla. The measurements were
performed in a 4He cryostat at temperatures in the range
of 1.4−4.2 K.

curves calculated from the theoretical expression derived
in Refs. 6 and 7. As found there, the magnetoconduc-
tivity of a two-dimensional electron gas, in the presence
of a perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld, is

III. RESULTS

A. Weak antilocalization

Weak-localization corrections to the average conduc-
tivity arise from interference between pairs of time-
reversed paths that return to their origin. Application
of a magnetic ﬁeld that destroys time-reversal symmetry
suppresses the interference and thus increases the con-
ductivity. Antilocalization appears in systems in which
the electrons are subjected to (rather strong) spin-orbit
coupling. Then, the interference-induced correction to
the conductivity is reduced, because the contribution of
time-reversed paths corresponding to wave functions of
opposite spins’ projections is negative, while that of the
equal spin-direction time-reversed paths remains posi-
tive. The reason is that upon following a certain closed
path, the electron’s spin is rotated by π, while for the
time-reversed path with the opposite spin projection it
is rotated by −π. These two phases add up to give a
total rotation of 2π, leading to a Berry’s phase factor
of −1. This results in a higher net conductivity, and
the positive magnetoconductivity caused by localization
is turned into a negative one at low magnetic ﬁelds.

Measuring the magnetoconductivity as a function of
the magnetic ﬁeld allows for an accurate estimate of the
phase-breaking length Lφ. The dotted curves in Fig. 3
are the magnetoconductivity ∆σ(B) of the longer Hall
bar as a function of a magnetic ﬁeld B directed nor-
mal to the sample. Upon increasing the magnetic-ﬁeld
strength from zero, one observes a decreasing conductiv-
ity originating from the suppression of antilocalization,
followed by an increase due to the destruction of local-
ization. Indeed, the line shapes at small magnetic ﬁelds

These parameters comprise Bφ = /(4eL2

coherence” magnetic ﬁeld, roughly the ﬁeld required to
destroy phase coherence, Bso = /(4eL2
so) that represents
the spin-orbit coupling, with Lso ≈ vF/ωso, and B0 =
/(4e(cid:96)2), where (cid:96) is the mean-free path.
The comparison of the data with Eq. (1) has yielded
Lso = 0.66 ± 0.09 µm for the spin-orbit characteristic
length, Lφ = 3.87 ± 1.03 µm at 1.6 K, and Lφ = 1.7 ±
0.3 µm at 4.2 K for the phase-coherence length. As seen
in Fig. 3, the curves of the data-points deviate from
the theoretical ones for magnetic ﬁelds exceeding B =
0.01 Tesla. We believe that at these ﬁelds there appear
other quantum corrections, e.g., interaction eﬀects, and
contributions arising from the parasitic conductances of
the layers below the quantum well.

B. Universal conductance ﬂuctuations

Like weak localization and weak antilocalization ef-
fects, the universal conductance ﬂuctuations of a meso-
scopic system result from interference of the electronic
wave functions corresponding to pairs of time-reversed
paths. As such, these ﬂuctuations are dominated by the
phase-coherence length Lφ. The UCF are expressed by
the ensemble-average autocorrelation function of the di-
mensionless conductance, g = G/(e2/h),8

F (∆B) = (cid:104)δg(B)δg(B + ∆B)(cid:105) ,

(4)
where δg(B) = g(B) − (cid:104)g(B)(cid:105). The angular brackets de-
note the ensemble average. Theoretically, the average is
over an ensemble of mesoscopic systems of various im-
purity conﬁgurations; the experiment is carried out on a
single sample and the average is accomplished by ramp-
ing a magnetic ﬁeld over the range ∆B (∆B was in the
range 10−3− 1 Tesla). This can generate sample-speciﬁc,
random-looking but reproducible ﬂuctuations in the con-
ductance.

4

C. The frequency and the amplitude of the

Aharonov-Bohm oscillations

Perhaps the most conspicuous manifestation of the
Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect9 in condensed matter are the pe-
riodic oscillations of the magnetoconductance of a meso-
scopic ring as a function of the magnetic ﬂux penetrat-
ing it, whose periodicity is the ﬂux quantum Φ0 = h/e.
These oscillations are utilized to probe the sensitivity of
the electronic wave functions to magnetic ﬂuxes. Their
amplitudes, i.e., their “visibility” is the hallmark of quan-
tum coherence.

The average area of the two rings we measured (see
Sec. II and Fig. 2) is ≈ 1.8 µm2; the periodicity of the
AB oscillations with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld is thus
expected to be ≈ 400 Tesla−1. The magnetoresistance of
our ring A as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld measured
at 1.5 K is portrayed in Fig. 5. Panel (a) there depicts
the raw data, and panel (b) magniﬁes the low-ﬁeld part of
the data. Once the low-frequency data points are ﬁltered
out [see panels (a) and (b) in Fig. 6], one can indeed
observe fast oscillations with a frequency of about 400
Tesla−1, consistent with the estimated periodicity for the
AB oscillations. On top of these, one sees beats, with a
frequency of about 40 Tesla−1. These observations are
consistent with the Fourier transform of the resistance,
shown in Fig. 7. Panel (a) there, (at magnetic ﬁelds in
the range 0.1−0.15 Tesla) is peaked around the expected
AB frequency ≈ 390 Tesla−1. Panel (b), based on data
points from the range 0.65−0.7 Tesla, has two peaks, at
≈ 390 Tesla−1 and at ≈ 330 Tesla−1. Analysis of data
between these ranges shows a gradual decrease of the
(average) AB frequency and a gradual increase of the
splitting between the two peaks. Although the coherence
length of our rings is of the order of the ring circumference
(see below), Fig. 7(b) also shows small peaks around
≈ 700 Tesla−1, probably corresponding to the second
harmonic of the AB oscillations.

The splitting of the main peak in the power spectrum
is the hallmark of the beating pattern,18 expected to re-
sult from the joint eﬀect of the strong spin-orbit coupling
and the Zeeman interaction.16,24 The appearance of the
beating patterns, and their comparison with theoretical
expectations, are discussed in Sec. IV.

The Fourier transforms of the magnetoresistance of our
sample B are similar to those shown in Fig. 7 for sample
A. The amplitude of the AB oscillations (the “visibil-
ity”), and therefore also the heights of the leading peak
in the Fourier transforms of the magnetoresistance, de-
crease with increasing temperature, because of the de-
crease of the coherence length. To deduce this length, we
used measurements on our sample B, at magnetic ﬁelds
below 0.05 Tesla, taken at 1.54 K, 1.78 K and 2.3 K. The
narrow range of magnetic ﬁelds has been chosen because
it contains mainly an amplitude of only a “single” har-
monic. According to Ref. 11, the amplitude of the h/e

The phase-coherence length is derived from the mag-
netic correlation ﬁeld Bc, i.e., the ﬁeld corresponding to
the half width at half height of F . This magnetic corre-
lation ﬁeld is found from the correlation function using
the condition

The resistance of the shorter Hall bar, measured at 1.52
K and at 4.2 K, is shown in Fig. 4(a). The reproducible
conductance ﬂuctuations are displayed in Fig. 4(b); the
curve there is obtained by subtracting the slowly-varying
background of the average conductance from the mea-
sured one. Taking β = 2 (corresponding to strong spin-
orbit coupling32,33) in Eq. (6) yields that the coherence
length of our short Hall bar is Lφ = 3.03± 0.8 µm at 1.52
K and is 1.56±0.8 µm at 4.2 K; Eq. (7) yields the values
Lφ = 2.3± 1.2 µm at 1.52 K and 1.65±0.25 µm at 4.2 K.

Using for the diﬀusion coeﬃcient and the sheet resistance
the values D = 0.13 m2/sec and R(cid:3) = 220 Ω for the
long Hall bar exploited in the WAL measurements, and
D = 0.06 m2/sec and R(cid:3) = 450 Ω for the samples on
which the UCF and the AB oscillations are measured, the
symbols in Fig. 8 mark the values of the “normalized de-
phasing rate”, h/(τφe2R(cid:3)){ln[h/e2R(cid:3))]}−1 as extracted
from our experiments. Ideally, these should fall on the
straight line kBT /, and indeed, within the experimental
error bars, they mostly do, regardless of the coherence
phenomenon from which they are deduced. In particu-
lar, at T =1.5 K, where the experimental data are most
reliable, all data points coincide with the theoretically-
predicted value.

IV. THE BEATING PATTERNS IN THE

MAGNETOCONDUCTANCE OF THE RINGS

The combined eﬀect of strong spin-orbit and Zeeman
interactions, in the adiabatic limit, is expected to induce
a Berry phase on the spin part of the electronic wave
function. The possibility that this geometrical phase can
be detected in power spectra of the magnetoconductance
oscillations of mesoscopic rings has been pursued quite
actively, both theoretically and experimentally (see Sec.
I for a brief survey). An interesting (theoretical) observa-
tion has been made in Ref. 18. Carrying out numerically
a rather complicate calculation of the AB oscillations and
the corresponding power spectrum (computed by zero-
padding the data before applying the Fourier transform
code), the authors found that the peak splitting in dif-
fusive rings depends strongly on the diﬀerent dephasing
sources, and that for small dephasing the splitting is to-
tally masked.

Our data are not suﬃcient to examine this observation.
We have therefore analyzed the simpler expression given
in Ref. 16 for the transmission T of a clean Aharonov-
Bohm ring35 subjected to strong spin-orbit and Zeeman
interactions,

(11)

This expression is valid in the adiabatic limit, pertaining
to the case where, as mentioned in Sec. I, both ωso and
ωZ are larger than the rotation frequency around the ring,
Ω.16 This condition is fulﬁlled by our rings, whether the
rotation frequency is calculated in the clean limit, Ω =
vF/(2πr), leading to Ω ≈ 0.33 meV, or in the diﬀusive
limit, Ω = D/[(2πr)2], in which case Ω ≈ 0.001 meV.
The transmission T is given in terms of two phases, each
of which is diﬀerent for the two spin orientations. The

For our samples’ parameters EF ≈ 12.3 × ωso, while ωZ
becomes comparable to ωso at about B = 2 Tesla. The
transmission as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld as derived
from Eq. (11) is illustrated in Figs. 9 (the parameters
use are those quoted in Sec. I and above).

The two panels in Fig. 9 display the transmission for
two diﬀerent ranges of the magnetic ﬁeld. Both show
an envelope of the AB oscillations, which varies slowly.
Figure 9(a) clearly exhibits beats, superimposed on fast
AB oscillations. From Eq. (12), the Berry phase is of
order π, and the AB phase is of order 2π × 400× B (B in
Tesla). Therefore, the Berry phase aﬀects the results only
for B < 0.002 Tesla, and it is practically irrelevant for
the interpretation of our data. Equation (11) shows that
the modulations of the AB oscillations, which result from

the factors tan2(Φ±
the prefactors sin2(Φ±

should exhibit beats at a very small frequency of order 2.7

two functions Φ±
S are approximately parabolic in B (for
small B), with slopes that increase with B. Speciﬁcally,

V. SUMMARY

We have measured weak antilocalization eﬀects, uni-
versal conductance ﬂuctuations, and Aharonov-Bohm os-
cillations in the two-dimensional electron gas formed
in InGaAs/AlInAs heterostructures. This system pos-
sesses strong spin-orbit coupling and a high Land´e fac-
tor. Phase-coherence lengths of 2−4 µm at 1.5−4.2 K
were extracted from the magnetoconductance measure-
ments. The analysis of the coherence-sensitive data re-
veals that the temperature dependence of the decoher-
ence rate complies with the dephasing mechanism origi-
nating from electron-electron interactions in all three ex-
periments.

Distinct beating patterns

superimposed on the
Aharonov-Bohm oscillations are observed over a wide
range of magnetic ﬁelds, up to 0.7 Tesla at the rela-
tively high temperature of 1.5 K. The Berry phase is
much smaller than the AB phase, and therefore cannot
be responsible for these beats. Qualitatively, the theory
of Aronov and Lyanda-Geller16 does exhibit beats due
to the interplay between the Zeeman and the spin-orbit
interactions. However, the beating frequencies found in
this theory are much smaller than those observed exper-
imentally. It thus seems that the source of the beating
pattern in the magnetoconductance of our rings are the
diﬀerent electronic paths through the ring, each pene-
trated by a slightly diﬀerent magnetic ﬂux.29 For exam-
ple, since the AB frequencies are proportional to the area
encompassed by the electronic paths, the measured ratio
of the two frequencies in Fig. 7(b), i.e., 390/330 ≈ 1.2,
implies a radii ratio of about 1.1. The width of our rings
(see Fig. 2) can easily accommodate two paths with such
a radii ratio, and hence may explain the beating pattern.

near B = 0.7 Tesla. The corresponding beats have even
smaller frequencies, of order 0.14 Tesla−1 and 1 Tesla−1,
respectively. These frequencies seem consistent with the
envelopes of the fast oscillations in Fig. 9. Although the
theory exhibits a slow decrease of the average frequency,
and a gradual increase of the beating frequencies, similar
to the experimental observations, all of these theoreti-
cal beat frequencies are much smaller than those seen
in the experiments. Fourier transforms of the data in
Fig. 9 (with or without zero-padding) indeed yield single
peaks at the ﬁrst harmonic of the AB oscillations, some-
what broadened by the Zeeman contributions. Higher
