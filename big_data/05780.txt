Abstract

We use density functional theory based ﬁrst-principles method to investigate the bandstructure and phase

stability in the laterally grown hexagonal Cx(BN)1−x, two-dimensional Graphene and h-BN hybrid nanoma-

terials, which were synthesized by experimental groups recently (Liu et al, Nature Nanotech, 8, 119 (2013)).

Our detail electronic structure calculations on such materials, with both armchair and zigzag interfaces be-

tween the Graphene and h-BN domains, indicate that the band-gap decreases non-monotonically with the

concentration of Carbon. The calculated bandstructure shows the onset of Dirac cone like features near
the band-gap at high Carbon concentration (x ∼ 0.8). From the calculated energy of formation, the phase
stability of Cx(BN)1−x was studied using a regular solution model and the system was found to be in the

ordered phase below a few thousand Kelvin. Furthermore, using the Boltzmann transport theory we calcu-

late the electrical resistivity from the bandstrcture of Cx(BN)1−x at diﬀerent temperature (T ), which shows
a linear behaviour when plotted in the logarithmic scale against T −1, as observed experimentally..

Method of Calculation

We carried out the ab-initio DFT calculations on
the 5 × 5 h-CBN unit-cell with armchair and zigzag
(Fig. 1) interfaces using the Quantum Espresso code

[29]. A hexagonal unit cell was chosen for both the

armchair and zigzag case. The plane wave calcula-

tions assume periodicity and hence to avoid interac-
tions between the sheets, a vacuum spacing of 13˚A

The bandstructure in Fig.

of Cx(BN)1−x decreases with increasing concentration of C.

Since the band gap of undoped h-BN is calculated to be 4.76-

like to add that our calculations were performed for the spin

polarized case. The spin up and spin down components of

the DOS happen to be exactly the same unlike reported by

[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. The reason for this is that those calcu-

lations are performed on nanoribbons. The spin polarization

on each atom diminishes as we move into the nanoribbon [38].

In this paper all our calculations are studied on an inﬁnite

sheet and hence there are no spin polarization on any atom.

(c) Resistivity from the Transport theory

Now we turn to our results of the resistivity ρ(T ) of
Cx(BN)1−x from the transport calculations. The resistivity

of CBN nanomaterials was measured earlier [7, 18].
It was
reported that ln(ρ) varies linearly with T −1 for diﬀerent con-
centration of B and N, indicating that CBN is semiconduct-

ing. The band gap Eg of CBN was estimated from Eq. (7)
[27]. In Fig. (4) we show the results of ln(ρ) against T −1, as-
suming τ = 10−14s, for the zigzag interface of Cx(BN)1−x at
x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, in the temperature range of 200K to

800K. The calculated data can be ﬁtted very well to straight

lines as shown in Fig 4 and the band gap Eg at each concen-

slope as shown in Fig. 4.
In Table 2, the band gap Eg of
Cx(BN)1−x calculated from the transport theory and those

calculated directly using DFT are compared. We ﬁnd an over-

all good agreement. It should be mentioned that the numerical

value of the relaxation time τ does not aﬀect the the band gap
estimation from the slope of Fig 4, since the constant ρ∞ in Eq

(7) will only shift the origin of the lines in Fig 4 and not aﬀect

their slopes. Any discrepancy of the calculated Eg should thus

come from inadequate k-point mesh. To our knowledge, this is

apparently the ﬁrst calculation of ρ(T ) for the semiconducting
nanomaterial Cx(BN)1−x from Boltzmann transport theory.

(d) Charge density and the PDOS

Finally,

in Fig.

charge density on all in-equivalent atoms across the armchair

(Figs. 4a and 4b) and the zigzag (Figs 4c and 4d) interfaces
of Cx(BN)1−x at x = 0.6. The calculated PDOS give a idea

about the contributions coming from each in-equivalent C, B

and N atoms towards the total DOS shown in Fig. 2. The

that covalent sp-bonding nature is preserved in Cx(BN)1−x.

The band structure and the DOS of Cx(BN)1−x are some-

what diﬀerent for the zigzag interface than armchair interface.

The bands immediately above and below the energy gap are

more ﬂat, as evidenced by a strong peaks in the DOS. It should

be noted that unlike in the armchair interface, in zigzag inter-

face the C atoms are terminated by either all B-atoms or by

all N-atoms (Fig. 1). This leads to diﬀerent type of excess

charge at the interfacial C-atoms. We have calculated this

excess charge from the diﬀerence of the L¨owdin charges be-
tween the similar atoms in Cx(BN)1−x and that of undoped

Graphene and h-BN [38].

We found, a C-atom terminated by a B (N) atom at the

zigzag interface would have more negative (positive) charge

than that in undoped Graphene; whereas on the zigzag inter-

face on the other side of the same domain the excess charge

on the interfacial C atom would be reversed. This leads to

strong peaks in the DOS above or below EF , which alternates

as one goes onto atoms lying deeper in the domain. This eﬀect

is illustrated in Fig. 4c where we show the calculated PDOS

on C-atoms going from one end of the zigzag interface to the

other end. Comparing the excess charges on the interfacial

C atoms, for both armchair and zigzag interfaces, we found

higher is this excess charge, larger is the band gap Eg.

Present calculations may be extended to include higher or-

der corrections to the exchange-correlation energy using HSE

[43] or GW [44] methods to check the validity of our re-

sults. However, the GGA exchange-correlation kernel used in

present calculations yields the groundstate physical properties

of Graphene and h-BN, in good agreement with experimental

results.
