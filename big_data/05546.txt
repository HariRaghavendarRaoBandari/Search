The nature of the bottomonium-like states Zb(10610) and Zb(10650) is studied by calculating
the B(∗)B
compositeness (X) in those resonances. We ﬁrst consider uncoupled isovector S-wave
scattering of B(∗)B
within the framework of eﬀective-range expansion (ERE). Expressions for the
scattering length (a) and eﬀective range (r) are derived exclusively in terms of the masses and
widths of the two Zb states. We then develop compositeness within ERE for the resonance case and
deduce the expression X = 1/p2r/a − 1, which is then applied to the systems of interest. Finally,
the actual compositeness parameters are calculated in terms of resonance pole positions and their
experimental branching ratios into B(∗)B
by using the method of Ref. [1]. We ﬁnd the values
X = 0.66 ± 0.11 and 0.51 ± 0.10 for the Zb(10610) and Zb(10650), respectively. We also compare
the ERE with Breit-Wigner and Flatt´e parameterizations to discuss the applicability of the last two
ones for near-threshold resonances with explicit examples.

INTRODUCTION

The discovery of exotic XY Z mesons, specially those
with hidden charm or bottom quarks, opens a new
era in hadron physics spectroscopy. Since the obser-
vation of X(3872) [2], more than twenty XY Z mesons
are observed by several experimental collaborations in
last decade [3], for recent reviews see Refs. [4–6]. The
conventional quark potential model, which is success-
ful in describing the heavy quarkonium below the open
heavy-ﬂavor threshold, typically cannot well accommo-
date these XY Z states. Interestingly many of these ex-
otic states share the common feature of lying nearby the
thresholds of pairs of open charm/bottom mesons. In this
respect, the eﬀective range expansion (ERE) approach
could provide a proper framework to study the physics
in the vicinity of thresholds [7, 8].

Amongst the many observed XY Z mesons, we focus
on the two bottomonium-like states Zb(10610)(Zb) and
Zb(10650)(Z ′
b) in the present work. They were mea-
sured by Belle Collaboration in the invariant mass spec-
tra of π±Υ(nS) (n = 1, 2, 3) and π±hb(mP ) (m = 1, 2),
through the Υ(5S) decays with an additional charged
pion [9]. All these ﬁve channels yield consistent values
for the mass and width of the resonances [9], which are
(in units of MeV)

b = 11.5 ± 2.2 .

to the noticeable feature that Zb and Z ′
b are charged
bottomonium-like states, they can not be conventional
heavy quarkonium. The neutral state Z 0
b (10610) was
also observed in Υ(5S) → Υ(nS)π0π0 [11] with mass and
width compatible with Eq. (1). The observed Z (′)
b have
quantum numbers I G(J P ) = 1+(1+) [9, 12], so that their
electrically neutral isotopic states (I3 = 0) should have
J P C = 1+−. Regarding this observation, the shorthand
notation BB
actually indicates the G = +1 combination
− BB∗.
BB

have
strongly intrigued theorists [4–6], and the properties of
the Z (′)
have been investigated in various theoretical
b
approaches with the main aim of unveiling their nature.
There are also proposals that the two Zb resonances
represent kinematical eﬀects at thresholds, e.g. Refs.
[13, 14] and [15]. The former two references interpret
them as cusp eﬀects, while the latter one advocates
the energetic initial-single-pion emission mechanism
to explain the experimental peak structures. How-
ever, Ref.
[16] argues that such interpretations are
not consistent. This reference shows that in order to
produce peaks as pronounced and narrow as observed
in experiment, nonperturbative interactions among the
heavy mesons are necessary, which also give rise to
the emergence of a nearby pole. Reference [16] also
stresses the importance of measuring the transition of
the near-threshold structure to the associated continuum
channel (this is measured for the Z (′)
in Ref. [10]) to
b
properly check the assumption about a purely kinematic
origin of near-threshold enhancements.

Several dynamical explanations have been proposed
to study these resonances, including mesonic molecular
states [17–28], compact tetraquark [29, 30], quark-gluon
hybrid [30], hadro-quarkonium [31, 32], etc (see Refs. [4–
6] for a more complete account of theoretical methods
and related works). Typically the diﬀerent models are

b

characterized by assuming diﬀerent constituents inside
b resonances. In the molecular picture the Z (′)
Zb and Z ′
contain pairs of heavy-light mesons (color-singlet clus-
ters) that largely do not overlap within the molecule and
keep basically their identities with small virtual three-
momenta involved in the making up of the state [17–
28]. On the contrary, more tightly packed states where
the heavy and light quarks overlap would be generic
multiquark states. For instance, two colored diquark-
antidiquark clusters are assumed to be the dominant
components in Ref. [29]. The quark-gluon hybrid ap-
proach advocates that the heavy quark-antiquark pair is
embedded in the gluon and light-quark ﬁelds [30]. In the
hadro-quarkonium model, the Zb states are described as
systems with a compact color-singlet heavy-quarkonium
core surrounded by light hadronic ﬁelds extending over
larger distances [31]. Tetraquark and open-heavy meson
molecule pictures were also examined within QCD sum
rules [33–37] and chiral quark models [22, 38]. Of course,
it is possible that the observed Z (′)
states could be an
b
admixture of several proposed mechanisms.

and B∗B

In the present work we do not study any of the pre-
vious models in further detail, but focus on the energy
regions in the vicinity of the BB
thresholds.
We proceed in terms of general considerations from scat-
tering theory, and no speciﬁc dynamics will be assumed.
First we employ the ERE and later the method derived
in Ref. [1]. Due to the fact that the central values of
the masses of Zb and Z ′
b are only around 2–3 MeV above
the BB
thresholds, respectively, we study
the elastic isovector S-wave B(∗)B
scattering that has
the same quantum numbers as the resonances. We em-
ploy the uncoupled ERE for such aim up to the res-
∗
onance pole positions. However, the nominal B(∗)B
three-momentum at the pole position is around mπ (with
mπ the pion mass), which is beyond the strict radius of
convergence of the ERE, that cannot exceed the one-pion
exchange branch point at momentum k = imπ/2. Never-
theless, there are serious indications that pion exchanges
are perturbative for the I G(J P ) = 1+(1+) B(∗)B
scat-
tering in the low-energy region near threshold.
In this
respect, we have the estimates of Ref. [39], based on
power counting in eﬀective ﬁeld theory, which establish
that the iteration of pion exchanges is suppressed by a
large expansion scale Λ, with Λ ≫ mπ. This strong sup-
pression conﬁrms the observation of Ref. [26] that the
exchange of light q ¯q is Okubo-Zweig-Izuka (OZI) sup-
pressed for the isovector B(∗)B
scattering, a suppression
that is seen in speciﬁc calculations too [15, 26, 40]. The
same power counting study of Ref. [39] establishes that
coupled-channel eﬀects should be suppressed as well, at
least a next-to-leading eﬀect. This is further reinforced
by the experimental measurement of the large branching
ratios (Br) of Z (′)
b

into B(∗)B

[10].

As a result, the ERE study of the uncoupled isovec-
scattering seems to be a realistic ﬁrst

values for scattering length (a) and eﬀective range (r) are
then required and we ﬁx them by reproducing the cor-
responding pole positions, with the masses and widths
given in Eq. (1).1 Negative values for a and r are found
between −1 and −2 fm. These natural values for the
ERE parameters indicate that the generation of the Z (′)
b
resonances does not require of any ﬁne tuning, contrar-
ily to e.g. S-wave nucleon-nucleon scattering and the
deuteron or πΣc scattering and the Λc(2595)+ resonance
[42, 43]. We also derive a general interpretation of com-
positeness (X) for resonances in ERE that is applicable
as long as the resonance mass is above the correspond-
ing threshold. If this condition is satisﬁed we ﬁnd that

X = 1/p2r/a − 1, plus contributions that would stem

from higher orders in the ERE expansion. Based on this
discussion we derive the scaling with the heavy-quark
mass for the mass and width of a resonance whose compo-
sition is saturated by the two-heavy-particle component.
This occurs when the resonance width is much larger
than the diﬀerence between the resonance mass and the
nearest threshold, a pattern that is approximately real-
ized in many XY Z resonances (including the Z (′)
reso-
b
nances). Two simple potentials that can reproduce the
values for a and r are discussed too. One of them con-
tains only purely local interactions and the other is an
attractive square-well potential. Through the compos-
iteness analysis, one can infer the inner structures of the
two Zb states and we ﬁnd that in the ERE case both res-
onances are dominated by the B(∗)B
component, 76%
(Zb) and 68% (Z ′

b), with an error of around 10%.

In the last part of the work, we make use of the method
of Ref. [1] that is based on the expressions for the com-
positeness of a resonance (with mass higher than the
lightest threshold) and its width (including eﬀects from
the mass distribution of the resonance due to its ﬁnite
width). Its applicability does not depend on the strength
of nearby branch points from crossed-channel dynamics
nor on the presence of other channels.2 Under the as-
sumption that the partial decay widths of the Z (′)
res-
b
onances into B(∗)B
saturate the total widths we then
reproduce the results of the ERE study. However, we
can use this other method to derive the actual compos-
iteness coeﬃcients by taking into account the experimen-

decay channels by the Belle Collaboration [10]. We then
ﬁnd X = 66% (Zb) and 51% (Z ′

weights, respectively.

theory from where they analyze the B(∗)B
composite-
ness of Z (′)

Finally, taking into account that the applicability of
the ERE is not aﬀected by the B(∗)B
threshold, while
this is the case for both Breit-Wigner and Flatt´e parame-
terizations, we then compare the amplitude squared from
ERE with these other functions. In this way, we can gain
some insight into the appropriateness of Breit-Wigner pa-
rameterizations to study the Z (′)
b , as done by the Belle
Collaboration [9–11]. We obtain that there is a marked
cusp eﬀect below threshold that can be well reproduced
by a Flatt´e parameterization, but the Breit-Wigner func-
tion accurately reproduces |t(E)|2 for E > Mth (includ-
ing the maximum of the amplitude squared which ﬁxes
the resonance mass). As a result, we conclude that to
apply Breit-Wigner functions to study the Z (′)
is not un-
b
realistic, at least as a ﬁrst approach. Of course, sounder
parameterizations are clearly required to improve accu-
racy. We also oﬀer a variant of the Flatt´e parameter-
ization that exactly reproduces the amplitude squared
calculated from the ERE.

The article is organized as follows. After this Intro-
duction we develop the ERE study of uncoupled isovec-
tor S-wave B(∗)B
scattering around threshold in Sec. II,
where the resulting values for a, r and the residues of the
partial-wave amplitudes at the resonance pole positions
are calculated. There we also adapt to nonrelativistic
kinematics the calculation of compositeness X in Ref. [45]
and derive an algebraic expression in terms of resonance
mass and widths, Sec. II A. These results are then ap-
plied to the Z (′)
resonances. In Sec. II B we consider the
b
limit X → 1 and the evolution of the pole position with
the heavy quark mass. Section II C discusses two poten-
tials that reproduce the values of a and r found for the
1+(1+) S-wave B(∗)B
scattering. In Sec. III we apply
the method of Ref. [1] and calculate the ﬁnal composite-
ness coeﬃcients in B(∗)B
b by taking into account
their experimental branching ratios. Section IV contains
a discussion about the question of applicability of Breit-
Wigner and Flatt´e parameterizations to ﬁt data in the
study of these resonances. A summary of the results and
conclusions are given in Sec. V .

cles in the pole positions corresponding to the resonances
have a modulus of around mπ, so that a closer look is
needed to justify the use of the ERE for the study of
the resonances Z (′)
Indeed the one-pion branch point
b .
is located at k = imπ/2 and then, strictly, the radius
of convergence of the ERE is smaller than the distance
to the resonance pole positions. At this stage, we make
use of advances in the literature where it is shown that
pion exchanges in the isovector B(∗)B
scattering are ex-
pected to be clearly perturbative, since their iteration is
suppressed by a large scale Λ ≫ mπ [39]. This outcome
is based on derivations from power counting in chiral
eﬀective ﬁeld theory [39, 46, 47]. This power counting
establishes that coupled-channel eﬀects are suppressed
too, at least up to next-to-leading order. On the other
hand, we also have the interesting observation of Ref. [26]
which found that one light q ¯q-meson exchanges violate
the OZI rule and are suppressed, while stressing the role
of heavy-vector exchanges (that would correspond to con-
tact interactions at low energy). Similar results were also
obtained in previous studies in the charmonium sector
[20, 48]. Then, we consider that for studying the Z (′)

II. EFFECTIVE RANGE STUDY

As explained in the Introduction we consider ﬁrst the
study of the uncoupled isovector S-wave B(∗)B
scatter-
ing around threshold, that has the same quantum number
as the Z (′)
resonances. At ﬁrst glance, the interest in this

partial wave seems justiﬁed since the masses of Z (′)
res-

onances are almost on top of the thresholds of B(∗)B
.
Nonetheless, the nominal three-momenta of these parti-

(3)

Regarding the kinematical variables used in this equa-
tion, E is the center-of-mass (CM) energy of the system
and k is the CM on-shell three-momentum. The nonrel-
ativistic relation between E and k is valid for the present
case and it reads

k =p2µ(E − Mth) ,

(4)

where µ = m1m2/(m1 + m2) is the reduced mass for the
system with masses m1 and m2 and Mth = m1 + m2
stands for the threshold.

The dynamical content of Eq. (3) is driven by the
sum over the so-called Castillejo-Dalitz-Dyson (CDD)
poles (each of them corresponds to a zero of t(E) at
E = Mi,CDD), so that the ith CDD pole is given in terms
of its residue gi and mass Mi,CDD. The expansion in pow-
ers of k2 of the CDD poles around k = 0 is equivalent to
the ERE, but notice that this expansion would be valid
until the position of the nearest CDD pole to threshold.
Up to including O(k2) in the expansion of k cot δ0 (with
δ0 the isovector S-wave B(∗)B
phase shifts) the ERE of
the S-wave amplitude can be written as

∗

t(E) =

(5)

Here we have employed the same normalization as in
Eq. (3), such that along the physical axis one has the
unitarity condition

Im t(E)−1 = −k ≤ 0 .

(6)

However, the convergent range of the ERE would be
severely restricted if any of the CDD poles in Eq. (3) had
a mass very close to Mth. This could be the case if the
∗
Z (′)
b had important components other than the B(∗)B
ones, e.g. other heavier channels or corresponding to
more elementary QCD degrees of freedom in terms of
compact quark-gluon states
[29–31, 37]. A distinctive
feature of this situation can be recognized by considering
the contribution of this CDD pole to a and r, which reads

δa = −
δr = −

Mth − Mi,CDD

,

µ(Mth − Mi,CDD)2 .

(7)

(8)

As a result one should expect that if Mi,CDD ≃ Mth a
large absolute value of r would arise, because the de-
nominator in Eq. (8) would involve the square of a small
quantity (of the order of a kinetic energy, which also
compensates for the appearance of the factor µ in this
denominator). In this case the eﬀective range r would be
much larger than a standard value from potential scat-
tering [7, 8], which typically would be similar to the nat-
ural range of strong interactions, m−1
QCD ∼ 1 fm,
with ΛQCD the typical QCD non-perturbative scale [3].
Then, the new small energy scale |Mi,CDD − Mth| could
totally spoil the application of the ERE analysis to the
Z (′)
thresholds. We refer to

Taking into account the previous warning, we apply
ﬁrst the ERE for t(E) at the pole position E = ER of

the resonance, with ER given by

(9)

where MR and ΓR are its mass and width, in order.3 We
denote by tII (E) the partial-wave amplitude t(E) in the
2nd Riemann sheet (RS), where the resonance pole lies.
Its explicit form reads

tII (E) =

Notice the change of sign in front of k, compared to
Eq. (5), with k given by Eq. (4) and calculated such that
Imk > 0 (1st RS). We denote by kR the momentum at
the resonance pole position,

and write it as

kR =p2µ(ER − Mth) ,

kR = kr + i ki , ki > 0 .

(11)

Let us derive a more explicit expression for kR. For that
we introduce the angle φ (0 ≤ φ ≤ π/4) deﬁned as

and in terms of it kR reads

The parameters a and r in the partial-wave amplitude
t(E) are ﬁxed so as to reproduce the mass and width
of the resonance, and from these values we can further
discern whether there is an indication of a nearby CDD
pole or just the opposite, i.e., a situation corresponding
to a pure S-wave potential scattering problem. We ﬁnd a

consistent here.

Notice that given kr and ki one always ﬁnds a and r from
Eqs. (17) and (18), respectively. For the opposite case,
that is, once a and r are known, there is a resonance
only if a < 0, r < 0 and a/2 > r, as it is clear from
Eqs. (17,18). The case kr = 0 corresponds to a virtual
state, MR < Mth and ΓR = 0, and only one equation
results then, 1/a + rk2

i /2 + ki = 0.

Around the pole position we expand the denominator
of tII (E) up to ﬁrst order in k − kR and, by taking into
account the resonance pole condition, cf. Eq. (16), the
expression for tII (E) becomes

As it is clearly seen from Table I, the values for r corre-
spond to the typical range of strong interactions, as they
are of the order of 1/ΛQCD. Because of this r behaves
as expected for potential scattering [7, 8]. In particular,
it excludes the possibility of having a nearby CDD pole
around threshold because, as discussed above, it would
give rise to large contributions in absolute value to r [42].
This fact, is also an indication that the Z (′)

r, cf. Eqs. (17,18), and the central values are given by
the respective mean values and the errors by the square
root of the variances. The procedure is of course stable
by increasing the number of points in the grid and, e.g.,
convergence is already found when nine points in equal
step for the mass and width are taken. The calculation of

In order to further quantify the statement on the na-

We can follow analogous steps for the derivation of the
criterion of applicability for the compositeness relation
as done in Ref. [45] but now in the variable E instead of
s. This change of variable is motivated by the fact that
we are considering a nonrelativistic system. The Laurent
series for tII (E) around E = ER in powers of E − ER
has |ER − Mth| as radius of convergence because of the
branch point at threshold, cf. Eq. (4). As a result, as
long as MR > Mth this Laurent series always embraces a
portion of the physical real axis and the probabilistic in-
terpretation of X as the weight in the composition of the
resonance then follows [45]. Notice that within the rela-
tivistic formalism of the latter reference the criterion for
the applicability of this result is more restrictive because
R > Mth then MR > Mth is fulﬁlled and
no contradiction arises between our present criterion and
that in Ref. [45]. At the practical level in our present
application to the Z (′)
resonances there is no diﬀerence

It need not be reiterated that G(E) in the 1st RS is
calculated with Im k ≥ 0, while in the 2nd RS Im k ≤
0.
In this latter case we denote the function G(E) as
GII (E). To avoid possible confusion with respect to the
RS in which k is calculated we write our formulas such
that k is calculated always in the 1st RS. In this from,
GII (E) reads

GII (E) =ik + G(Mth) , Imk > 0 .

(26)

From this equation we also obtain

Then, for MR ≥ Mth we have, according to procedure

nance mass from the narrow resonance case to the inner complex
plane.

because φ ∈ [0, π/4], cf. Eq. (13). According to Eqs. (14)
and (15), the upper bound in the previous equation holds
for MR ≥ Mth, which shows the importance of fulﬁll-
ing the criterion for compositeness so as to ascribe this
meaning to X. Furthermore, the condition MR ≥ Mth
deduced in the nonrelativistic discussion also provides a
concrete example of the method of Ref. [45]. The ele-
mentariness Z is deﬁned as

Z =1 − X ,

(30)

and 0 ≤ Z ≤ 1 because of Eq. (29). We can also express
X directly in terms of the observable quantities a and r
since

The saturation of the equality X = 1 occurs only for

when a = r, according to Eq. (31). In our present study
this limit situation would correspond to Z (′)

composed purely of two heavy mesons.

B. Scaling of the width in heavy-meson composite

For the Z (′)

resonances one has that the (small) width
is signiﬁcantly larger than the diﬀerence between the res-
onance mass and the close B(∗)B
heavy-meson thresh-
old, cf. Eqs. (1) and (33). This is also a typical situation
for many of the reported XY Z resonances. If this is the
case and the ERE can be applied, as argued above this
is expected to be a good (ﬁrst) approximation for the
Z (′)
b , one can derive a simple way a scaling law for the
width of the resonance. Let us recall that according to
the discussion in Sec. II A the limit 2(MR−Mth)/ΓR → 0
correspond to a resonance made purely by the two heavy-
mesons (X → 1).
|MR − Mth| becomes in good approximation,

The resonant momentum kR in the limit ΓR/2 ≫

We further require that r has a natural size for strong
interactions, so that a CDD pole near threshold, which
would give rise to a large contribution to r for MCDD →

we ﬁnd from Eq. (36) an order of magnitude estimate for

Since we assume that ΓR/2 ≫ |MR − Mth| one has the

µ ≫ |MR − Mth|.

(38)

Eqs. (37) and (38) imply that as the heavy-quark mass
increases the resonances composed mainly by the heavy-
ﬂavor mesons should become narrower and basically sit
on top of threshold in the energy plane. However, let us
notice that kR is stable because of the product of µ and
ΓR,

(39)

kR ≈p−iµΓR ∼ −e−i π

The estimate of the width for the B(∗)B

systems from
Eq. (37) gives ΓR ∼ 30 MeV. Here we have taken ΛQCD ≃
200 MeV, because the momentum transfer is small and

∗

7

this corresponds to the ﬁrst few low-mass quark ﬂavors.
The estimated value for ΓR agrees with the experimental
widths of the Z (′)
b , Eq. (1), within a factor of around 2.
The consistency check of Eq. (38) is well fulﬁlled because
the diﬀerences between resonance masses and thresholds,
cf. Eq. (33), are considerably smaller than Λ2
QCD/µ ∼
15 MeV.

C. Two simple models as examples

Here we present two potentials that reproduce exactly
the values of a and r deduced above from the ERE ap-
plication to the study of the pole positions of the Z (′)
b
resonances.

As a ﬁrst example, we consider a pure contact theory

with an S-wave potential of the form

v(p, k) = C0 + C2(p2 + k2) ,

(40)

with p and k three-momenta.
In terms of this poten-
tial one can reproduce any negative values for a and r.
This can be explicitly shown by solving the corresponding
Lippmann-Schwinger equation

t(p, k; E) =v(p, k) +

2

π Z ∞

0

dq

q2v(p, q)t(q, k; E)
q2 − k2 − i0+

, (41)

such that E = k2/2µ and the on-shell T -matrix element,
t(k, k; k2/2µ) corresponds to t(E), already introduced.
One can easily solve Eq. (41) by proposing a solution of
the form

t(p, k; k2/2µ) =t0(k) + t2(k)(k2 + p2) .

(42)

The integrations in the variable q2 can be done with a
three-momentum cut-oﬀ Λ. For a given Λ one then solves
C0 and C2 such that the values for a and r are repro-
duced. This makes that both C0 and C2 become func-
tion of Λ. Real solutions C0(Λ) and C2(Λ) exist whenever
r < 0, e.g. we have for C2(Λ),

C2Λ3 = −

3π

2 (1 ±

√3(π − 2α)

p3(2α − π)2 + 4α2 − α2ρπ) ,

(43)

where α = aΛ and ρ = rΛ. The crucial property to end
with real counterterms (as required for the potential in
Eq. (40) to be Hermitian) is to demand that the radicand
in the previous equation be positive,

3(2α − π)2 + 4α2 − α2ρπ ≥ 0 ,

(44)

which is always the case if r < 0 (ρ < 0). In the limit
Λ → ∞ one obtains exactly the ERE approximation for
t(E) of Eq. (5),

t(E) =

1
2 rk2 − ik

− 1
a + 1

+ O(Λ−1) .

(45)

Ref. [57] ﬁnds that a renormalized eﬀective ﬁeld theory
with only contact interactions gives rise to an ERE (al-
though the reverse is not always true [58], cf. restriction
in Eq. (44)). Thus, a contact interaction theory with
two couplings can exactly reproduce the results obtained
before in the ERE study, for which a and r are negative.
The second example corresponds to a simple attractive

square-well potential of radius R ,

v(r) = −V0θ(R − r) ,

(46)

with V0 > 0. The S-wave amplitude can be easily found,
e.g. by solving the corresponding Schr¨odinger equation

(cid:26) d2
dr2 + 2µV0θ(R − r) + k2(cid:27) u(r) = 0 ,

(47)

with u(r) the reduced wave function. This is explicitly
solved e.g. in Ref. [59]. The resulting S matrix is

S(E) =e2iδ0(E)

=e−2ikR eik′R(k + k′) + e−ik′R(k′ − k)
e−ik′R(k + k′) + eik′R(k′ − k)

,

where

(48)

(49)

k′ =pk2 + 2µV0 .

The ERE is obtained from the expansion in powers of k2
of

k cot δ0 =k cot(cid:20)−kR + arctan(cid:26) k

k′ tan (k′R)(cid:27)(cid:21) .

(50)

The corresponding expressions for a and r are

(51)

(52)

(53)

∗

If we consider the application of this toy model to the
isovector S-wave B(∗)B
scattering one expects that the
value of γ2 ≫ 1 by taking the simple dimensional es-
timates R ≃ 1/ΛQCD and V0 ≃ ΛQCD, together with
µ ≃ MB/2 ≃ 2.6 GeV, where MB is the mass of the B
meson.5 Then

γ2 ∼

MB
ΛQCD ∼ 30 .

(54)

5 The departure of the estimate r ∼ R (used in Sec. II B) from
Eq. (52) with large γ would require x → 0, which is far from our
case since we have x ∼ −1, cf. Table I. Indeed for x = 0 the
ERE breaks down because then k cot δ(0) = ∞.

8

As a result, in order to end with a negative value for a
from Eq. (51) (so that tan γ/γ > 1), it is necessary that

γ → (n +

)π ,

(55)

with n ∼ 1, 2 to match the estimate in Eq. (54).
The parameter x has a well-deﬁned limit for γ2 → ∞.
To obtain this conclusion we ﬁrst notice that x can be
ﬁxed by the ratio r/a, since it results from Eqs. (51,52)
that

However, kR corresponding to the resonance poles of
S(E) does not run with µ. This is clear if we consider
the equation satisﬁed by kR,

R + γ2 cos2(k′

RR) = 0

(61)

that results from Eq. (48) by requiring that S(ER)−1 = 0.
For large γ2, with γ2
0 = [(n + 1/2)π]2, Eq. (61) can be
expressed as

R + R−2O(1) = 0 ,

Let us also mention that the limit γ → (n + 1/2)π− 0+
implies a = −∞ (for ﬁxed n), which is a virtual state at
threshold. This is the ending (never reached) point that
continuously connects with the resonance case that we
are discussing by extrapolating the resonance mass be-
low threshold. The fact that kR does not scale with µ

is an exempliﬁcation of the considerations that we al-
ready explored within the ERE and heavy quark limit in
Sec. II B (for X → 1), cf. Eq. (39).6

III. COMPOSITENESS AND WIDTH

∗

It is clear that in the uncoupled ERE with real values
of a and r the full widths of the Z (′)
should correspond to
b
the partial decay widths into the channels B(∗)B
. This
is a bonus of the ERE approach employed here since in
this way one does not need to apply a (heuristic) formula
to reproduce the width of a resonance in terms of its cou-
pling. This was e.g. the case in Ref. [1] to account for
the χc1p width of Pc(4450) (note the two-channel prob-
lem there, namely J/ψp and χc1p). However, the method
of Ref. [1] allows one to drop several assumptions in-
herent to the ERE study of the uncoupled isovector S-
wave B(∗)B
scattering performed in the previous sec-
tion. This is convenient because then one does not need
to assume the particle content for the involved states nor
scattering in just one partial wave (several partial waves
per channel could be possible). In addition, this method
is rather insensitive to the issue of the strength of nearby
branch points from crossed-particle exchanges.7

∗

We start by extending the brief discussion given in
Ref. [1], which establishes a rather clear picture for the
width of the resonance in terms of |γ|2 and the mass
distribution induced by the ﬁnite width itself. On the
one hand, we have the standard two-body decay formula
[3] of a resonance into one channel in terms of its cou-
pling squared. The corresponding equation in our nor-
malization, Eq. (6), can be easily deduced by consider-
ing that t(E) is saturated by the resonance contribution,
t(E) → −γ2/(s − sR), and then requiring the fulﬁllment
of the unitarity condition Eq. (6). This implies

k = MRΓR(E)/γ2 .

(63)

We then deduce the expression,

9

resonances.)

We take the modulus of the residue in Eq. (64) because
it is generally a complex number, cf. Eq. (22). The de-
cay width formula Eq. (64) should be valid for a narrow
resonance when the distances between MR and decay-
channel thresholds are large in comparison with the res-
onance width (this latter condition is not satisﬁed by the
Z (′)
b
Another point worth stressing with respect to Eq. (64)
is that this equation applies to the width of a resonance
independently of its angular momentum because the uni-
tarity requirement Eq. (6) is valid for any partial wave
(not only for S-wave). The same can be said for the com-
positeness X of Eq. (28), that applies to any angular-
momentum resonance, as it is clear from the analysis
undergone in Ref. [45]. As a result, if a two-body par-
ticle decay channel appears in several partial waves for
a given resonance (due to the mixing of orbital angular
momentum and spin quantum numbers) the total decay
width and compositeness of the resonance in such decay
channel are given by Eqs. (64) and (28), but with |γ2|
corresponding to the sum of the residues of all partial
waves involved, |γ2| =Pi |γ2
i |.

k follows from
Eq. (64) by taking into account the relationship between
γ2 and γ2

Γ(1) =

k(MR)|kR| .

(65)

The more standard form of Γ(1), e.g. the one appearing
in Ref. [3], implies to use the resonance coupling squared
g2, which in terms of the residue γ2 corresponds to

g2 =(cid:12)(cid:12)γ28πER(cid:12)(cid:12) ≃ |γ2|8πMR .

In the last step we have used that MR ≫ ΓR/2 for the
Z (′)
b . In terms of g2 Eq. (64) becomes

6 Nevertheless, one has not to pursue too far the analogy with the
spectroscopy of the square-well potential because this depends on
higher-order shape parameters in the ERE, and then it is more
sensitive to the ﬁner details of the toy model. In this respect we
notice that for |kR| < 1/R all the poles of S(E) lie along the
imaginary axis [57, 60], while the ERE for this potential is valid
up to |k| . 1.3/R (r/a = 1), as follows from the position of the
closest zero of t(E) at threshold. However, a and r parameterize
the low-energy limit of the T -matrix and are sensitive to the
global aspects of the potential, characterized by its strength and
range.

7 Nevertheless, it is assumed that a Lorentzian mass distribution
with a constant coupling holds for the resonance, which could be
aﬀected by the presence of nearby and strong crossed-particle-
exchange branch points.

where k(W ) is the three-momentum as a function of
the total energy W , cf. Eq. (4). The latter variable is
distributed around the resonance mass according to the
Lorentzian mass distribution of mass MR and width ΓR.
The last Eq. (69) results from Eq. (68) by taking into ac-
count the relationship between g2 and γ2
k, cf. Eqs. (22),
(28) and (66).

We oﬀer here a brief derivation of Eq. (68). For that
we allow to vary the invariant mass W of the two-body

decay channel according to a mass distribution F (W )
around the nominal resonance mass MR and denote by
M the corresponding resonance coupling/residue (which
could also depend on W ). In this way, instead of Eq. (67)
we have now the more general expression

Γ =Z +∞

Mth

dW k(W )

8πW 2

|M|2F (M ) ,

(70)

where the lower limit of integration results because the
two particles in the decay channels are the asymptotic
ones.

For a narrow resonance one typically takes

F (M ) =δ(W − MR) ,

(71)

which, after being inserted in Eq. (70), leads to Eq. (67).
When ﬁnite-width eﬀects are considered a standard and
simple option is to use for F (W ) a Lorentzian mass dis-
tribution,

F (W ) =

Im

W − MR − iΓR/2

ΓR

(W − MR)2 + ΓR

2/4

(72)

and then Eq. (68) results if additionally |M|2 → g2, so
that any possible energy dependence is neglected.
In-
deed, Eq. (67) stems also from Eq. (68) in the limit of
zero width, being the later much more adequate to take
into account ﬁnite-width eﬀects. For example, the mass
of the Pc(4450) [62] at its lower range within error bars
lies indeed below the χc1p mass so that one cannot ap-
ply Eq. (67), since then k would become complex. This
caveat is solved with the use of Eq. (68), and the er-
ror estimate of the calculated width can be performed
rather straightforwardly from the experimental errors of
the mass and width of Pc(4450).

For the practical use of Eq. (68) we distinguish between
integrating up to ∞ or up to MR+nΓR, with n ﬁxed such
that Γ(2) coincides with the experimental value. Proceed-
ing in this way is justiﬁed because the Lorentzian mass
distribution has a long tail which gives rise to a slow
convergence of the integration in Eq. (68). The resulting

>

width from the integration up to ∞ is denoted by Γ(2)
and the one up to MR + nΓR by Γ(2)
< .
We ﬁrst consider the value for g2 corresponding to the
ERE results (last row of Table I). In this case, consistency
between ERE and the present method requires that the
calculated width in terms of the coupling be the same
as the experimental one (the one imposed in the ERE
analysis of Sec. II). The numerical values of Γ(1), Γ(2)
>
and Γ(2)
< are summarized in Table II. From the table, we
see that these widths are compatible with the measured
ΓR in Eq. (1) within errors. The width Γ(2)
< reproduces
exactly the experimental width with n ≃ 8, that will
be used in the following whenever we employ Eq. (68)
with a ﬁnite upper integration limit. Of course, Γ(2)
> is

larger than Γ(2)
< , as indicated by the subscripts, due to
the larger integration region for a positive integrand in
Eq. (68).

Now, we follow the method of analysis of Ref. [1], that
heavily relies in the expressions for the width, Eq. (68),
and compositeness X, Eq. (28). As indicated at the be-
ginning of this Section, we do not need to assume in this
way that the Z (′)
resonances stem from uncoupled isovec-

scattering, nor the applicability itself
of the ERE up to the resonance pole positions, as done
in the ERE study of Sec. II.

Firstly, we perform two consistency checks between the
previous ERE study in Sec. II and the new one based on
the approach of Ref. [1]. On the one hand, we take the
same basic assumption as in the ERE, so that the only
relevant open channel around the resonance energy re-

As a result, we assume that B(∗)B

imental total decay widths of Z (′)

From this requirement we can calculate the value of X

For the second consistency check, we assume that the

i.e., X → 1. This assumption also implies that the res-
onance should fully decay into B(∗)B
because the cou-
pling to any other open channel should tend to zero (oth-
erwise X would depart from 1). In this case γ2
k takes its
maximum possible value, γ2
k = 1. One can then deduce
the value for the width of the resonance to B(∗)B
un-
der such circumstances by making use of Eq. (69) with
X = 1 and ΓR in the right-hand side replaced by Γ(2).

obtains that Γ(2) becomes huge (in practical terms ∞)
around several hundreds of MeV. This is in agreement
with Eq. (29) for X in the ERE, such that the limit
X → 1 with MR− Mth 6= 0 strictly requires that Γ → ∞.
Importantly, the branching ratios for the partial decay
widths of Z (′)
have been measured by Belle

Collaboration in Ref. [10], cf. Eq. (2). Although these
ﬁgures are large, the Br’s are clearly less than 1, so that
). In order to take care of this
experimental fact and provide a more accurate determi-
nation of X one has to depart from the ERE study and
use the method of Ref. [1]. The latter allows us to ﬁnd
the actual compositeness coeﬃcient X (denoted by Xex)
by making use of Eq. (69) with Γ(2) = ΓRBr. One then

The results obtained with W+ = Mth + 8ΓR are shown
in the last row of Table III, being almost identical to
those that would result if we had used instead Γ(1) from
Eq. (65) (as we have checked). The BB
weight calcu-
lated within the Zb is (66 ± 11)%, and the B∗B
one for

the Z ′

weight is dominant for the Zb, while the B∗B
compo-
nent is around one half of the total composition of the
Z ′
components play a
more important role for the latter, being appreciable for
both resonances. This is also clear by comparing Xex
in Table III with the compositeness coeﬃcient deduced
in the ERE study, cf. 3rd row of Table I. For the Zb
state both calculations have similar central values while
for the Z ′
b they are more diﬀerent, though still compat-
ible within error bars. This latter fact also reﬂects the

b. As a result, other non B(∗)B

mention that our results for Xex are similar to those in
Ref. [44], where X for each resonance is estimated to be
around 60%.

IV. ERE VS. BREIT-WIGNER AND FLATT ´E

PARAMETERIZATIONS

∗

We now address the question about the applicability
of Breit-Wigner functions in the experimental analyses
of Refs. [9–11] for the Z (′)
b due to the closeness of the
thresholds of the B(∗)B
states, an issue stressed e.g. in
Refs. [18, 63, 64]. The ERE is adequate to check whether
a Breit-Wigner (or Flatt´e) function is appropriate since
the applicability of ERE is not aﬀected by the threshold
singularity associated with the B(∗)B
. For deﬁniteness
let us take the central values of a and r in Table I for
the Zb (analogous conclusions would equally apply to the
b). We are going to compare |t(E)|2 calculated within
Z ′
the ERE, cf. Eq. (5), with i) a Breit-Wigner function of
constant width, bw(E),

In addition, M ′
R is ﬁxed such that the real part of the

at the pole position E = ER (in the 2nd RS). This implies
the equation

(79)

The normalization factors |t(MR)|2 in Eq. (76) and f0
in Eq. (77) are ﬁxed such that the maximum value of
the Breit-Wigner and Flatt´e parameterizations coincides
with the maximum of |t(E)|2.
We perform this comparison in the top panel of Fig. 1
where the solid line corresponds to |t(E)|2, the dashed
curve to bw(E) and the dash-dotted one to f t(E). On
the one hand, we see that bw(E) lies on top of |t(E)|2
above threshold, while below it they do not follow each
other due to the cusp eﬀect in |t(E)|2. This simply re-
ﬂects the fact that the pole position of the Zb lies on

threshold.8 Be-
physical energy axis only above the BB
low this threshold the form of the rise is a typical cusp
eﬀect which is enhanced because the pole of the Zb ﬁxes
the size of t(E) at the threshold point. On the other
hand, we observe that the Flatt´e parameterization f t(E)
can reproduce accurately the cusp eﬀect for E < Mth,
while it agrees worse with |t(E)|2 than the Breit-Wigner
function for E > Mth. The Flatt´e parameterization as
a function of energy shows above threshold a diﬀerent
qualitative form compared with |t(E)|2, although they
are not very diﬀerent quantitatively.
The reason for this disagreement above threshold lies
in the fact that ΓR is signiﬁcantly larger than MR − Mth
and this softens the energy dependence of |t(E)|2 around
the BB
threshold compared with the abrupter eﬀects

implied by Eq. (78) when implemented in Eq. (77).9 Ac-
cording to the previous discussion, in order to end with a
situation in which the Flatt´e parameterization matches
|t(E)|2 above threshold, we decrease the width of the
pole obtained from the ERE approximation by decreas-
ing r and keeping a ﬁxed (so that X decreases). If we take
r = −5.5 fm the pole position is now (10606.2−i3.0) MeV
(with X = 0.32); the width is six times smaller, while
the resonance mass changes very little. Since now the
imaginary part of the pole position has a size compara-
ble with MR − Mth ≃ 2 MeV we should then expect a
better agreement with the Flatt´e distribution. This is
indeed what happens as plotted in the bottom panel of
Fig. 1, where the Flatt´e distribution is able to reproduce
faithfully |t(E)|2 in the whole energy range shown. Once
more, the Breit-Wigner parameterization with constant
width perfectly matches |t(E)|2 above threshold.
We can indeed rewrite Eq. (5) by taking into account
the presence of the resonance, so that Eq. (16) is fulﬁlled.
Equation (5) then becomes

The diﬀerence with respect to the Flatt´e parameteriza-
tion in Eq. (77) stems from the fact that now one has

γ(E) = −

2γ2
kkkr
µ

(82)

R with Mth+ |kR|2

instead of ΓR(E), with |kR| substituted by −kr. Again
in the limit of small width both expressions agree but
for ΓR ≫ |MR − Mth| they are markedly diﬀerent, be-
cause in such a case |kR| ≃ −kr√2, cf. Eq. (35), and
then ΓR(E) ≃ γ(E)√2. Due also to this reason, if we di-
rectly identify M ′
2µ in f t(E), as read from
Eq. (81), we obtain diﬀerent results, corresponding to the
dotted line in the top panel of Fig. 1. The disagreement
between f t(E) and |t(E)|2 in this case is quite worse than
the one between the solid and dash-dotted lines in the top
panel of Fig. 1. The adjusting process for M ′
R, Eq. (79),
reduces the diﬀerences. In conclusion, for the case of the
Z (′)
resonances the use of Breit-Wigner functions to ﬁt
b
data [9–11] seems to be a reasonable approach, as long as
the resonance mass is clearly above threshold. This con-
clusion is reﬂected by similarity between the solid and
dashed lines in Fig. 1.
Indeed, the peak position ﬁxes
the Breit-Wigner mass in bw(E) in a precise way (in
agreement with MR), while one could certainly obtain

8 The overlapping between diﬀerent RS’s is discussed in detail in

Ref. [66].

9 Notice that in the Laurent series around the pole position of the
resonance the function t(E) and its derivatives are evaluated at
ER = MR −iΓR/2. This is why for ΓR ≫ |MR −Mth| the eﬀects
of the branch point for MR ≃ Mth are softened.

a reasonable estimate for the width by comparing |t(E)|2
and the approximate bw(E) curve. Nonetheless, sounder
theoretical parameterizations of data should be pursued
so as to pin down resonance parameters more accurately.
In this respect, the modiﬁed version of the Flatt´e param-
eterization corresponding to Eq. (81), exactly reproduces
|t(E)|2 from the ERE.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

∗

∗

∗

and B∗B

In this work we study the resonances Zb(10610) (Zb)
and Zb(10650) (Z ′
b) based on analyticity and unitarity
as basic principles of scattering theory. The dynamics is
encoded in the pole positions of the resonances, which
allows us to determine from unitarity the couplings of
these resonances to BB
, in order. These
basic principles also determine the compositeness coeﬃ-
cient (X) of a resonance into an open two-body channel,
as shown in Ref. [45]. We adapt these results to nonrela-
tivistic scattering and obtain that X can be calculated for
resonances whose mass is larger than threshold. By em-
ploying the uncoupled eﬀective range expansion (ERE),
up to including O(k2) terms, X can be directly expressed
in terms of the measurable scattering length (a) and eﬀec-
tive range (r) as X = 1/p2r/a − 1. With kR = kr + iki
(ki > 0, kr < 0), the two-body three-momentum at the
resonance pole position, one can also express X in terms
of the resonance mass MR and width ΓR as X = −ki/kr.
For a small ratio 2|MR− Mth|/ΓR this expression simpli-
ﬁes to X = 1− 2|MR− Mth|/ΓR +O((|MR− Mth|/ΓR)2),
being Mth the threshold energy.
We ﬁrst perform an ERE study of uncoupled isovec-
tor S-wave B(∗)B
scattering, because it has the same
quantum numbers as Z (′)
[9] and these resonances lie
b
in the vicinity of the open-bottom meson thresholds. It
is then worth ﬁrst focusing just on S-wave. Neverthe-
less, the associated three-momentum at the resonance
pole position (kR) has a modulus around mπ, with mπ
the pion mass. In connection with this, we argue that
although the branch point due to one pion exchange
(at k = imπ/2) could severely restrict the applicability
of ERE to B(∗)B
scattering up to the resonance pole
positions, this seems not ﬁnally be the case because of
the perturbative nature of pions in the present systems.
Namely, we consider estimates based on power counting
in eﬀective ﬁeld theory [39] which shows that the itera-
tion of pion exchanges is suppressed by a large expansion
scale Λ for the isovector B(∗)B
systems (Λ ≫ mπ). This
suppression is in line with the observation of Ref. [26],
also reﬂected in speciﬁc calculations [15, 26, 40], that the
exchanges of light q ¯q mesons are OZI suppressed for the
isovector B(∗)B
scattering. The very same power count-
ing study of Ref. [39] also establishes that coupling eﬀects
between diﬀerent channels should be suppressed, at least
a next-to-leading eﬀect. This also matches with the ex-
∗
perimental large branching ratios of the Z (′)
,

into B(∗)B

measured in Ref. [10]. As a result, the ERE study of the
uncoupled isovector S-wave B(∗)B
scattering seems an
adequate ﬁrst approximation to the problem.

∗

13

∗

Within this working assumption, we apply the ERE
up to including O(k2) and the real parameters involved,
a and r, are ﬁxed so as to reproduce the pole posi-
tions of the Z (′)
resonances according to their masses and
b
widths. The resulting values of a and r ∼ −(1 − 2) fm
for both resonances have a size of around the standard
range of strong interactions. This in turn indicates that
the B(∗)B
scattering near threshold would rather corre-
spond to a potential scattering problem, which also im-
plies that other compact components in the Z (′)
states
b
would play a relatively minor role. This is based on the
observation that otherwise the nearby presence of a CDD
pole would imply large contributions to |r|, cf. Eq. (8).
Note that a priori, within an uncoupled S-wave ERE for
B(∗)B
scattering, the magnitude of the eﬀective range
r could be very diﬀerent compared to the standard po-
tential scattering problem. See Ref. [42] for a concrete
example of a physical system with a resonance on top
of thresholds that requires large values for |r| and small
ones of X.
This conclusion on the inner structure of the Z (′)
b
states is further supported through the quantitative cal-
culation of the compositeness X within ERE. We ﬁnd

∗

that X = 1/p2r/a − 1 and obtain the numerical values
X = 0.75 ± 0.15 and 0.67 ± 0.16 for the Zb and Z ′
b, in
order. These numbers are rather close to 1, which oc-
curs whenever ΓR ≫ MR − Mth (MR ≥ Mth). This is
a qualitative feature realized in many XY Z resonances
and that indicates that the corresponding states would
have an important two-heavy-particle component in their
compositeness (as long as the application of uncoupled
ERE is justiﬁed). We also derive a scaling law for the
width of purely composite two-heavy-particle resonances
in S-wave such that Γ ∼ 2Λ2
QCD/µ ≫ MR − Mth, where
ΛQCD ≃ 200 MeV, µ is the reduced mass of the two-heavy
particles.
In the last part of the paper, we apply the method of
Ref. [1] that only relies on the expressions for compos-
iteness and the partial decay width of a resonance (tak-
ing into account its mass distribution). In particular, its
applicability is not directly aﬀected neither by nearby
branch points from crossed-particle exchanges nor by the
presence of other channels. Although, in connection with
this, the validity of the Lorentzian mass distribution for
the resonance is assumed to hold. In this way we can take
into account the fact that the branching ratios of Z (′)
to
b
B(∗)B
, although rather large, are less than 1. After
showing that consistent results with the ERE study are
obtained under the same basic assumption (that the total
width of the resonance is saturated by its partial decay
width into B(∗)B
), we apply the method of Ref. [1] to
ﬁnd the actual value of compositeness (Xex). We ﬁnally
obtain that Xex = 0.66 ± 0.11 and Xex = 0.51 ± 0.10
for the Zb and Z ′
b, respectively, in accordance with the

∗

∗

experimentally measured branching ratios. The B(∗)B
components found indicate that the BB
is dominant
among the components of the Zb, but around half of the
composition for the Z ′
b. Other contributions then also
play an important role in the inner composition of these
resonances (particularly for the latter).

∗

∗

∗

∗

We also perform a comparison between the ERE ap-
proximation for the isovector S-wave B(∗)B
scattering
amplitude squared, |t(E)|2, and the Breit-Wigner and
Flatt´e parameterizations. This comparison could shed
light on the issue of whether it is appropriate to apply
Breit-Wigner functions to ﬁt data in the experimental
study of the Z (′)
resonances. The reason is because the
b
applicability of the ERE is not aﬀected by the nearby
B(∗)B
threshold, while this is the case for both Breit-
Wigner and Flatt´e parameterizations. We obtain that
there is a marked cusp eﬀect for energies below thresh-
old that can be well reproduced by a Flatt´e parameter-
ization. However, the use of the Breit-Wigner function
with constant width for resonance peaks above thresh-
old accurately reproduces |t(E)|2 for E > Mth (includ-
ing the maximum of the amplitude squared which ﬁxes
the resonance mass). We have also derived a variant of
Flatt´e parameterization that exactly reproduces |t(E)|2
from ERE. All in all, we conclude that it seems plau-
sible to use Breit-Wigner functions to study the Z (′)
b ,
though sounder parameterizations are clearly required to

14

improve accuracy.

Needless to say that the method developed in Refs. [1,
42] and in this work, employed here to study the Z (′)
b
resonances, could be also applied to other near-threshold
resonances, and work along this direction is ongoing.
