ABSTRACT

Large scale tidal ﬁeld estimated directly from the distribution of dark matter halos
is used to investigate how halo shapes and spin vectors are aligned with the cosmic web.
The major, intermediate and minor axes of halos are aligned with the corresponding
tidal axes, and halo spin axes tend to be parallel with the intermediate axes and per-
pendicular to the major axes of tidal ﬁeld. The strengths of these alignments generally
increase with halo mass and redshift, but the dependencies are only through the peak
height, ν ≡ δc
σ(Mh,z) . The scaling relations of the alignment strengths with the value of
ν indicate that the alignment strengths remain roughly constant when the structures
within which the halos reside are still in quasi-linear regime, but decreases as nonlinear
evolution becomes more important. We also calculate the alignments in projection so
that our results can be compared directly with observations. Finally, we investigate the
alignments of tidal tensors on large scales, and use the results to understand alignments
of halo pairs separated at various distances. Our results suggest coherent structure of
the tidal ﬁeld is the underlying reason for the alignments of halos and galaxies seen in
numerical simulations and in observations.

Introduction

It has been known for a while that galaxies and galaxy systems have preferred orientations in
the cosmic web. For galaxies, their major axes are found to have a tendency to align with the large
scale structure and with other galaxies (Brown et al. 2002; Okumura et al. 2009; Faltenbacher et

al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2013). The spin axes of disk galaxies tend to lie in sheet-like structures
(Navarro et al. 2004; Trujillo et al. 2006; Tempel et al. 2013) and to align with the intermediate
axis of the large scale tidal ﬁeld (Lee & Erdogdu 2007; Zhang et al. 2015). For galaxy systems,
the major axes of galaxy clusters tend to point to neighboring clusters, based on both optical and
X-ray observations (Binggeli 1982; McMillan et al. 1989; Plionis et al. 1994). These alignments are
important not only for understanding the formation and assembly of galaxies and galaxy systems
in the cosmic density ﬁeld, but also for interpreting weak gravitational lensing results, because
they may contaminate lensing signals based on shear-shear correlations of background sources (e.g.
Croft & Metzler 2000).

Most of the theoretical investigations so far have attempted to understand the observed align-
ments through the links between galaxies and dark matter halos extracted from cosmological N -
body simulations. In earlier analysis, a common practice is to assume that the spin axes of disk
galaxies and the principal axes of elliptical galaxies are directly aligned with those of their host
halos (e.g. Heavens et al. 2000; Jing 2002). The resultant alignments are, however, much stronger
than in observations, indicating that galaxies may not be perfectly aligned with their host halos
(e.g. Heymans et al. 2004; Okumura et al. 2009). More recently, galaxies identiﬁed in hydrody-
namical simulations have been used to study galaxy alignments (e.g. Codis et al. 2015; Velliscig
et al. 2015), and the results obtained are similar to those in observations, indicating that baryonic
processes may play an important role in producing the observed alignments. Using cosmological
simulations, these investigations automatically take into account the coherent nature of the cosmic
web within which halos are embedded, and so galaxy alignments on large scales may be produced
by the alignments of halos with their local environments together with the coherent structures on
large scales (e.g. Dekel et al. 1984; Splinter et al. 1997; Hopkins et al. 2005; Schneider et al.
2012). For instance, Lee et al. (2008) measured halo eigenvector-direction correlation function to
quantify halo alignments on large scales, and found a signiﬁcant signals up to scales of ∼ 50 Mpc.
Using the eigenvectors of the tidal tensor to represent the direction of large scale structures, Hahn
et al. (2007a,b) found that halos have major axes preferentially parallel with the directions of the
ﬁlaments in which the halos are embedded and perpendicular to the normals of the sheets (see also
Forero-Romero et al. 2014). The spin vectors of halos tend to be perpendicular to (parallel with)
the ﬁlament and sheet for massive (low-mass) halos (e.g. Aragon-Calvo et al. 2007; Hahn et al.
2007a,b; Zhang et al. 2009).

In order to understand these alignment results, Wang et al. (2011) studied the alignments
of halo spin and orientation with large scale tidal ﬁeld, which is thought to be the driving force
for structure formation (Bond et al. 1996). They found that the major and minor axes of halos
are strongly aligned with the stretching and compressing directions of the tidal ﬁeld, respectively,
regardless of the morphology of the structure. Similar results were found by Libeskind et al. (2013a)
using velocity tensors. In addition, Wang et al. (2011) found that halo spin vectors tend to be
aligned with the intermediate axis and perpendicular to the stretching direction of the tidal ﬁeld
(see also Forero-Romero et al. 2014), as expected from the tidal torque theory that works in the

– 3 –

quasi-linear regime (e.g. Lee & Pen 2000; Porciani et al. 2002).

It is important to note that, in addition to halo spin and orientation, tidal ﬁeld also aﬀects
various other halo properties, such as assembly history, substructure abundance, shape, dynamical
properties and the accretion ﬂow pattern (e.g. Wang et al. 2011; Shi et al. 2015; Kang & Wang
2015). Thus, for a given mass, halo clustering in space is expected to depend on halo properties,
a phenomenon known as halo assembly bias (e.g. Gao et al. 2005; Wechsler et al. 2006; Wang
et al. 2007; Jing et al. 2007; Bett et al. 2007; Faltenbacher & White 2010; Sunayama et al.
2015). Clearly, the alignments of halos in the cosmic web provide another avenue to investigate
how environmental processes aﬀect the formation and structure of dark matter halos in the cosmic
density ﬁeld.

In this paper, we present detailed analyses of the alignments of halo orientations and spins
with the large scale tidal ﬁeld, using directly the tidal tensors that can be reconstructed from the
distribution of dark halos. We focus on how the mass and redshift dependencies of the alignments
may reﬂect the importance of nonlinear evolution of the cosmic density ﬁeld in aﬀecting various
alignments, and on how alignments on large and small scales are connected to each other. The
paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we describe the simulations used here, and the methods
we adopt for estimating halo principal axes, halo spins and the large scale tidal ﬁeld. In section
3 we present our results for halo alignments in three dimensional space, and the dependence of
alignments on redshift and halo mass. In section 4 we show results for the alignments in projection
so that they can be compared directly with observations. Section 5 shows how tidal tensors are
aligned on large scales, and how such alignments induce alignments of halos at large separations.
Finally, our results are summarized in section 6.

2. Dark matter halos and tidal ﬁelds

2.1. N -body simulations and Dark matter halos

Our halo catalog is obtained from four independent cosmological N -body simulations carried
out with Gadget-2 (Springel 2005). The cosmological parameters used in these simulations are
ΩΛ,0 = 0.742 for the cosmological constant, Ωdm,0 = 0.214 and Ωb,0 = 0.044 for cold dark matter
(CDM) and baryons, respectively, h = 0.72 for the dimensionless Hubble constant, σ8 = 0.8 for
the rms linear mass ﬂuctuation in a sphere of radius 8 h−1Mpc extrapolated to z = 0, and n = 1
for the slope of the primordial ﬂuctuation spectrum. The CDM density ﬁeld of each simulation
set is traced by 10243 particles in a cubic box of 200 h−1Mpc on each side, with particle mass
mp ≈ 5.3× 108h−1M⊙. The gravitational force is softened isotropically on a co-moving length scale
of 4 h−1kpc (Plummer equivalent). Each simulation produces 80 snapshots from z = 17 to z = 0,
with the expansion factor evenly spaced in logarithmic space.

Dark matter halos are selected from each snapshot with the use of the standard FoF algorithm

– 4 –

(Davis et al. 1985) with a link length equal to 0.2 times the average inter-particle separation. We
exclude halos dominated by ’fuzzy’ particles, i.e. halos whose most massive sub-halo identiﬁed by
the SUBFIND algorithm (Springel et al. 2001) contains less than half of the mass of the parent FoF
halo. These halos are usually small and thought to be gravitationally unbound.

2.2. Halo principal axes and spin vector

We use the inertia momentum tensor I of a halo to characterize its orientation. The compo-

nents of I are computed using

Ijk = mp

N

X

n=1

xn,jxn,k,

(1)

where xn,j (j = 1, 2, 3) are the components of the position vector of the nth particle relative to
the center of the mass of the halo in question, and N is the total number of particles contained in
the FoF halo. We use the normalized (unit) eigenvectors i1, i2, i3 to denote the directions of the
major, intermediate and minor axes, respectively. The spin vector of the halo is estimated though
the deﬁnition

j = PN
|PN

n=1 xn × vn
n=1 xn × vn|

(2)

where xn and vn are the position and velocity vectors of the nth particle relative to the center
of mass, and the ‘×’ denotes cross-product. The estimations for both the principal axes and spin
vector are aﬀected by the mass resolution (see Schneider et al. 2012). To reduce such eﬀects
as much as possible, we only calculate the orientation and spin vectors for halos with masses
Mh ≥ 1012 h−1M⊙, i.e. halos containing at least 1,880 particles.

2.3. Large-scale tidal ﬁeld

Following Wang et al. (2011), we estimate the tidal ﬁeld tensor on a halo by summing up the
tidal ﬁeld tensors exerted by other halos above a mass threshold Mth. Thus the tidal ﬁeld tensor
on a halo can be written as

Nh

T =

X

n=1

R3
n
r3
n

rnrn .

(3)

Here rn (rn) is the co-moving distance (unit vector) from the nth halos to the halo in question, Rn is
the virial radius of the nth halo, and Nh is the number of halos with masses above Mth and rn < rp,
with rp being a distance limit to be speciﬁed below. The tidal ﬁeld tensor is then diagonalized to
obtain the three eigenvalues, t1, t2 and t3 (by deﬁnition satisfy t1 > t2 > t3 and t1 +t2 +t3 = 0), and
the corresponding eigenvectors, t1, t2 and t3 (major, intermediate and minor axes). Deﬁned in this
way, t1 corresponds to the direction of stretching of the external tidal force, while t3 corresponds to
the direction of compression. We refer the readers to Wang et al. (2011) for the details of the tidal

– 5 –

ﬁeld and comparisons with other environmental indicators of dark matter halos. In the literature,
another way to calculate the local tidal ﬁeld is to use the total mass density ﬁeld (e.g. Hahn et al.
2007a). In those investigations, e3 (or t3) is usually used to denote the stretching direction, while
e1 (or t1) is used to denote the compressing direction.

In this paper we adopt rp = 70 h−1Mpc. Our tests suggests that choosing an even larger rp
changes the results very little. In our previous studies, Mth = 1012 h−1M⊙ is adopted to estimate
the tidal ﬁeld at redshift z = 0. The co-moving number density of halos of Mh ≥ 1012 h−1M⊙ is
about 2× 10−3h3 Mpc−3 at z = 0, and so the tidal ﬁeld is relatively densely sampled by these halos.
However, the number density of such halos decreases with increasing redshift, reaching to ∼ 10−5
at z ∼ 5, so that only ∼ 100 such halos are available in the simulation box. Clearly, if we want to
extend the analysis to redshift z ∼ 5, adopting Mth = 1012 h−1M⊙ is not appropriate.

To make a reasonable choice for Mth, we calculate the tidal tensors at the location of a given
halo using four diﬀerent values of Mth: 1012, 1011.5, 1011 and 1010.5 h−1M⊙, and estimate the
diﬀerence in the orientations of the tidal tensors obtained from these values of Mth, namely we
estimate cos αa,k = |tk(1012) · tk(1011.5)|, cos αb,k = |tk(1011.5) · tk(1011)| and cos αc,k = |tk(1011) ·
tk(1010.5)| (k = 1, 2, 3). The mean values of cos α as functions of redshift are presented in Fig. 1.
One can see that cos αc,k is the largest, followed by cos αb,k and cos αa,k. At z = 0, all the three
axes have cos αa,k > 0.90, suggesting that adopting Mth = 1012 h−1M⊙ is suﬃcient for a reliable
estimate of the orientations of the local tidal ﬁelds. However at z ∼ 5, the mean cos αa,k decreases
to about 0.63 for t1, 0.54 for t2, and 0.60 for t3, suggesting that using Mth = 1012 h−1M⊙ is no long
suﬃcient. On the other hand, the mean cos αc,k decreases only slowly with redshift and reaches
to 0.9, 0.81 and 0.86 at z ∼ 5 for the three principal axes, respectively.
It thus suggests that
adopting Mth = 1011 h−1M⊙ and 1010.5 h−1M⊙ do not yield signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the estimated
tidal tensor orientations even at z <
∼ 5, and that it is unnecessary to go down to smaller Mth. In
the following presentation, all tidal ﬁelds are estimated using Mth = 1010.5 h−1M⊙.

3. Alignments in three-dimensional space

The alignment of halo principal axes and spin vector with the large scale structure, character-
ized either by the tidal ﬁeld or velocity shear tensors, has been investigated extensively in the past
(e.g. Hahn et al. 2007b; Aragon-Calvo et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2011; Libeskind
et al. 2013a;2013b; Forero-Romero et al. 2014). However, most of these investigations have been
focused on z = 0, although some attempts have been made to extend the analysis to moderately
high redshift (e.g. Hahn et al. 2007b). In this paper, we extend the analysis to z ∼ 5 and study
how the alignments evolve with redshift so as to understand their origins. We ﬁrst investigate the
alignments between halo principal axes and the large scale tidal ﬁeld (§3.1) and then the alignments
of halo spins (§3.2).

– 6 –

3.1. Alignments of halo principal axes with local tidal ﬁeld

Wang et al. (2011) found that the major (i1) and minor (i3) axes of halos tend to align with
the stretching (t1) and compressing (t3) directions of the large scale tidal ﬁeld, respectively (see
also Libeskind et al. 2013a for similar result based on velocity tensor). In Fig. 2, we show the
distributions of the cosine of the angles between i1 and t1 for halos in four redshift bins, as indicated
in the ﬁgure. The corresponding results for i3 · t3 are presented in Fig. 3. Results are shown only
for log(1 + z) ≤ 0.8, as the tidal ﬁeld estimated with Mth = 1010.5 h−1M⊙ becomes unreliable at
higher z (see §2.3).

The top three panels of Fig. 2 show the results for halos in three diﬀerent mass bins, as indicated
in the ﬁgure. The choices of the three mass bins are the compromise of two considerations: ﬁrst,
we want to show results covering a wide mass range; second, in each mass bin we can have at least
two relatively smooth curves to compare. All the distributions are peaked at one, indicating that
i1 tends to align with t1. At a given redshift, the alignment tends to be stronger for more massive
halos, consistent with previous results obtained for z = 0 (e.g. Hahn et al. 2007a). For halos of
the same mass, the alignment is stronger for halos at higher z. However, the redshift dependence
can be almost completely eliminated if halo mass Mh is expressed in terms of the peak height ν,
deﬁned by ν ≡ δc
σ(Mh,z) , where δc ≈ 1.686 is the critical linear over-density for collapse, and σ(Mh, z)
is the rms linear mass ﬂuctuation on the halo mass scale extrapolated to redshift z. The bottom
three panels show the distributions for halos in three ν bins selected so that for each ν bin at least
two results are reliable for comparison. Note that halos of small masses at high redshift have ν
comparable to that of the most massive halos at z = 0. For the highest ν, the distribution functions
at the two low redshift bins are quite noisy, because the corresponding samples contain only a small
number of massive halos. Overall our results demonstrate that the redshift dependence shown in
the top panels is produced by the evolution of the characteristic mass scale, and that the alignment
between i1 and t1 depends on redshift and halo mass only through a single parameter ν.

The behavior in the alignment between i3 and t3 is very similar, as shown in Fig. 3. Here
the dependence on redshift and halo mass individually is even stronger than that in the i1 - t1
alignment, but again the dependence is almost entirely through the peak height ν. Given that the
redshift dependence is only though ν, we use halos in the whole redshift range (log(1 + z) ≤ 0.8) to
obtain an overall distribution function. The two overall functions for i1 · t1 and i3 · t3 are plotted as
the black diamonds in Fig. 2 and 3, respectively. There is also a notable diﬀerence in the results
between the major and minor axes. For major axis, the alignment in the intermediate ν bin is
considerably stronger than that in the smallest ν bin, while no such diﬀerence is seen between the
two higher ν bins. For minor axis, on the other hand, the alignment continues to strengthen with
increasing ν across all the three bins. We will come back to this diﬀerence between minor and
major axes later.

To see the dependence on redshift, halo mass and ν in more detail, Fig. 4 shows the mean
cosine of the alignment angles between the three halo principal axes and the corresponding tidal

– 7 –

directions as functions of halos mass and ν. The four colored lines represent the results in four
diﬀerent redshift bins. Bins in halo mass or in ν are equally spaced in logarithm scale, except at
the highest mass or ν end, where wider bins are used so that the number of halos in each bin is not
too small. The error bars (and all other error bars shown in this paper) are 1σ conﬁdence intervals
derived from the standard deviation of the values of our four independent simulations.

The top three panels show the alignments as functions of halo mass. The result for z = 0
is consistent with that obtained by Wang et al. (2011). Overall, the strengths of the alignments
increase with mass and redshift, suggesting that the role of large scale structure in aﬀecting halo
orientation is more important for massive halo and at high redshift. Furthermore, the alignments
of major and minor axes have similar strength while that of intermediate axis is weakest among
the three. For the intermediate and minor axes, the curves for the four redshift bins share a similar
positive slope. In contrast, the trends for the major axis appear to be diﬀerent: the dependence on
halo mass becomes weaker as redshift increases, and is almost absent for the highest redshift bin.

When ν is used instead of halo mass, the redshift dependence is eliminated almost entirely
for all the three axes, as demonstrated in the bottom panels. For reference, we plot the mean
values averaged over all halos (log(1 + z) ≤ 0.8) as black diamonds. For the major axis, the
alignment strength ﬁrst increases rapidly with ν and then is almost saturated above a transition
scale, ν1 ≃ 2.0. The strength of the alignment for the minor axis increases with ν over almost the
entire range of ν that we can probe. A ﬂat plateau also appears, but at much higher values of ν,
ν > ν3 ≃ 3.3. Since the maximum values of the average cosine for both the major and minor axes
are about 0.75, the fact that ν1 < ν3 implies that the alignment for the major axis is stronger than
that for the minor axis at ν < ν3. The alignment strength for the intermediate axis is overall much
weaker, with a maximum value of ∼ 0.6 and a transition occurring at ν2 ≃ 0.27, a value between
ν3 and ν1.

The results obtained here may give us some important insights into the origin of the align-
ments of halos with large-scale structure. Since ν ∼ 1.686/σ(M, z), and σ(M, z) characterizes the
typical ﬂuctuation amplitude of perturbations of mass scale M at redshift z, the value of ν basi-
cally describes the importance of non-linear environmental eﬀects on the formation and structure
of dark matter halos, with lower ν values indicating more important non-linear environmental ef-
fects. The fact that the strengths of alignments increase with ν, therefore, suggests that non-linear
environments tend to weaken the alignments.

According to our deﬁnition of tidal ﬁeld, the major and minor axes correspond to the stretching
and compressing directions of the local gravitational ﬁeld. Thus, gravitational collapse to form a
halo is expected to proceed from being along the minor axis ﬁrst, then along the intermediate axis,
and lastly along the major axis of the local tidal ﬁeld. As such, non-linear evolution is expected
to be the most important along the minor axis and the least along the major axis. Consequently,
for a given M , non-linear eﬀects, which tend to suppress alignment, start to operate earlier along
the minor axis, i.e. when σ(M, z) is smaller or ν is larger, than along the other two axes. This

– 8 –

explains why ν1 < ν2 < ν3. According to this interpretation, νk(k = 1, 2, 3) may be used to indicate
the transition of the environmental eﬀects from the linear to nonlinear regimes. While nonlinear
eﬀects become important to aﬀect the alignments at ν < νk, the results at ν > νk mainly reﬂect
the alignments between halos with the linear tidal ﬁeld. Our results, therefore, show that, in the
linear regime, the alignments between halos and tidal tensor are quite independent of ν. Similar
behavior is also found in the alignments of halo spins with tidal tensor, as we will see in the next
subsection.

Another possibility is that non-linear processes do not play any important role in aﬀecting
the alignments of halos with tidal tensor, and the dependence on ν is completely due to the initial
alignments in the linear density ﬁeld. The dependence of the alignment strength on ν may then
be explained by the fact that halos of diﬀerent ν reside in diﬀerent local tidal ﬁelds. However, it is
unclear how this scenario explains the diﬀerence in the transition scales for the three diﬀerent axes.

Using the tidal ﬁeld estimated from the mass density ﬁeld, Hahn et al. (2007b) found that
the major axes of halos embedded in ﬁlamentary structures tend to be parallel with the ﬁlament,
while the major axes of halos in sheets are preferentially parallel to the sheet plane. In particular,
they found that these alignments are independent of redshift once the halo mass is scaled with
the typical halo mass, M∗, deﬁned through δc/σ(M∗, z) = 1. Our ﬁndings are consistent with
theirs, but there are several important diﬀerences. In the investigation of Hahn et al. (2007b), only
halos with z ≤ 1 are considered, while our analyses extend to much higher redshift, z ∼ 5. As we
have demonstrated, including halos at high redshifts is crucial in revealing the regime where the
dependence on ν becomes unimportant. When presenting their results, Hahn et al. adopted 2M∗
as the smoothing scale to calculate the tidal tensor. Since M∗ decreases rapidly with increasing
redshift, the smoothing scale will become too small at high redshift to be deﬁned properly in
simulations. For instance, at z = 5, log M∗ ≃ 6.3 for the WMAP5 cosmology, and so the smoothing
mass scale of 2M∗ corresponds to a length scale of 0.015 h−1Mpc, which is usually much smaller
than the grid size used in calculating the tidal tensor. This might be the reason why Hahn et al.
did not go beyond z = 1. In our analysis, the tidal ﬁeld is estimated from the halo population,
and our tests have shown that the method provides a reliable estimate of the tidal tensor at z = 5
when halos with masses down to Mth = 1010.5 h−1M⊙ are used. In addition, instead of using the
large-scale structures, such as ﬁlaments and sheets to represent the large scale environments of
halos, as was done in Hahn et al., we use directly the local tidal tensor that is more closely related
to accretion patterns around dark matter halos (see Shi et al. 2015). Finally, the tidal ﬁeld derived
from the mass density ﬁeld includes the contribution of halo’s self-gravity. This led Hahn et al. to
suggest that the dependence of the alignment strength on halo mass is due to the fact that their
tidal tensor estimate may be aﬀected by halo shapes, which are more elongated for more massive
halos. Our estimate of the tidal ﬁeld does not include the self gravity of halos, and so our results
are not aﬀected by the mass-dependence of halo shape.

3.2. Halo spins

The tidal torque theory predicts that the halo spin axis tends to be parallel with the interme-
diate axis of the tidal ﬁeld, i.e. with t2 (e.g Lee & Pen 2000; Porciani et al. 2002; Lee & Erdogdu
2007). To test this with our simulations, we show in Fig. 5 the distributions of cos θ = |j · t2| for
the same three mass bins and four redshift bins as used above for the halo principal axes. As one
can see, the halo spin axis tend to align with t2, but the trend is not strong, with the alignment
strength increasing with halo mass. These results are in good agreement with previous ﬁndings,
and provide support to the tidal torque theory. In addition, our results also reveal that, for a given
halo mass, the alignment of the spin axis with t2 tends to be stronger at higher redshift.

Here again, the dependence on redshift and halo mass is through the peak height, ν, and the
redshift dependence is almost entirely eliminated when ν is used instead of halo mass, as shown in
the lower panels. Note that for the highest ν bin, the two high redshift curves match each other
very well; the discrepancy seen for the two lower redshift curves is mainly caused by small number
statistics, as halos with high ν are rare at low z. The black diamonds in the lower panels show the
results obtained by averaging over halos in the entire redshift range.

Fig. 6 shows the mean values of the cosine of the alignment angles between j and tk(k = 1, 2, 3)
as functions of halo mass (top panels). In contrast to t2, t1 tends to be perpendicular to j (see e.g.
Wang et al. 2011; Forero-Romero et al. 2014). The strengths of both the alignment with t2 and the
anti-alignment with t1 increase with increasing redshift and halo mass. The j-t3 alignment appears
more complicated. First, the dependence of the alignment strength on halo mass and redshift is
weaker than those for the other two axes, t1 and t2. Second, massive halos tend to have their spin
direction weakly aligned with t3, while the ones with log Mh/h−1M⊙ < 13.5 exhibit a weak but
signiﬁcant anti-alignment that is almost independent of z at z < 3.

The bottom three panels of Fig. 6 show the mean alignment angles as functions of ν (instead
of halo mass).
It is remarkable that the redshift dependence seen in the upper panel for the
intermediate axis is almost entirely eliminated. The overall mean values together with the ﬁtting
results for the spin alignment with intermediate axis are also plotted in the lower middle panel for
reference. One sees that the strength of the alignment ﬁrst increases with increasing ν, and then
remains roughly at a constant value of ∼ 0.57 at ν > νj ≃ 2.5. This behavior is very similar to that
seen in the alignments of halo principal axes with the tidal tensor. In particular, the transition
scale, νj, for the spin alignment is very close to ν2 in the i2-t2 alignment, indicating that the two
alignments may have a similar origin.

Based on the tidal torque theory, Porciani et al. (2002) showed that the mean cosine of the
alignment angle between j and t2 is 0.59 for halos more massive than 1012 h−1M⊙. They also
calculated such alignment for proto-halos and obtained a value of 0.56. These results are in good
agreement with ours (0.57) for high ν. At lower ν, our simulations give lower alignment strengths
than the theoretical predictions. This may not be surprising, because a lower value of ν implies that
non-linear eﬀects are more important (see §3.1) and because the tidal torque theory is expected to

– 10 –

work well only in the quasi-linear regime. Thus, our results suggest that the strength of the spin-t2
alignment in the linear regime is, on average, a constant over a large mass range, and non-linear
eﬀects tend to reduce the alignment.

The situations for the other two axes are more complicated. For halos of a given mass, redshift
dependence in the strengths of the j-t1 and j-t3 alignments is clearly present, and particularly
strong in the former, as shown in the upper panels of Fig. 6. The use of ν to replace halo mass
shifts the results for the high redshift bins to the right, but the shift is so much that a reversed
redshift trend is produced. Compared to the results shown in the top panels, the four lines for
j-t1 are now closer, particularly at small ν, although still not on top of each other. Since halos
acquire their angular momenta through accretion, the correlation of spin vector with the major
and minor axes of tidal ﬁeld may be understood in terms of accretion ﬂow. In Shi et al. (2015)
it was found that the position and velocity vectors of the accreted sub-halos relative to the hosts
tend to be parallel with, and perpendicular to, the major axis of the tidal ﬁeld, respectively. Thus,
the accreted angular momentum is expected to be preferentially perpendicular to the major axis,
as we see in the results for the j-t1 alignment. They also found that the position vector tends to be
perpendicular to the minor axis, but the alignment between velocity vectors and the minor axis is
weak. This is consistent with the weak j-t3 alignment we see here. However, it is still unclear why
the j-t1 and j-t3 alignments do not have as tight a scaling relation with ν as the j-t2 alignment
does.

3.3. Fitting to the scaling relations

Our results above show that the alignments between i1 and t1, i2 and t2, i3 and t3, and j and
t2 all obey some scaling relations with the peak height ν. In this subsection, we present the ﬁtting
results for these relations. As shown above, these relations all seem to contain two phases, and we
adopt the following form to ﬁt the mean alignments as functions of ν,

A(ν) = a1 + a2arctan(a3(ν − 0.85)) .

(4)

The ﬁtting results are shown in Figure 4 and 6 as dashed lines. Given the uncertainties, the
ﬁtting results describe the simulation data well. The best ﬁtting parameters are (a1, a2, a3) =
(0.57, 0.13, 2.06) for i1-t1, (0.51, 0.09, 0.61) for i2-t2, (0.58, 0.16, 0.73) for i3-t3 and (0.58, 0.16,
0.73) for j-t2.

For each ν bin, we ﬁnd that the overall distribution of cos θ (shown as diamonds in Figure 2,

3 and 5) can be well described by the following form

d n

d cos θ

=

(5)

1 − 2β(eb − 1) nA(ν) − β (cid:16)eb − 1(cid:17) + β [1 − 2A(ν)] beb cos2 θo ,

where b is the only free parameter, β = [√πberﬁ(√b)]−1 and erﬁ is the imaginary error function.
The form of this equation makes sure that the integral from cos θ = 0 to 1 is equal to one (i.e.

– 11 –

the distribution function is normalized) and the mean cos θ of the distribution gives A(ν). The
Levenberg-Marquardt method is used to ﬁnd the best ﬁtting parameter b, and the results for
diﬀerent ν bins are given in Table 1. The corresponding curves are plotted in Figures 2, 3 and 5
as the dashed lines for the three ν bins we have chosen to plot. Note that the i2-t2 alignment have
properties similar to the other two axes. The ﬁtting parameters for this axis are also given in the
table for completeness, although the alignment results are not shown in ﬁgures.

4. Alignments in projection

In observation, three-dimensional tidal ﬁeld can be reconstructed from the distribution of
galaxy groups (e.g. Wang et al. 2012) or from galaxy distribution (e.g. Lee & Erdogdu 2007).
However, halo orientations in 3-d space are diﬃcult to obtain observationally. One common practice
is to study the alignments between large scale structure and the following two projected orientations:
(i) the projected distribution of satellite galaxies; (ii) the orientation of the image of the central
galaxy in a group. In this subsection we present alignment results in two-dimensional space, which
may be more closely related to observation.

We choose the x-y plane in a simulation to represent the sky, namely the z-axis to be along the
line of sight. For a halo, the projected principal axes are then represented by the following vectors
in the x-y plane:

Ik =

(ik,1, ik,2) (k = 1, 2, 3) ,

(6)

1

qi2

k,1 + i2
k,2

where ik,1 and ik,2 are the x and y components of the three dimensional principal axis, ik. Similarly,
the projected tidal directions are given by

Tk =

1

qt2

k,1 + t2
k,2

(tk,1, tk,2) (k = 1, 2, 3) ,

(7)

where tk,1 and tk,2 are the x and y components of tk.

The mean alignment angles between Ik and Tk as functions of halo mass and ν are plotted

in Fig. 7. Here we show the alignment angles instead of the their cosines.
space, the angle between two random vectors has a uniform distribution in the alignment angle,
while for two random vectors in the three-dimensional space it is the cosine of the angle between
the two vectors that has a uniform distribution. As is clear, there is a strong tendency for Ik to
be aligned with Tk, as the average angles are all smaller than the expected value of 45◦. The
alignment is stronger for halos of higher masses and and at higher redshift. The dependence on
mass and redshift is largely through ν, as shown in the lower panels. The diamonds in the lower
panels show the mean angles obtained from the entire redshift range, log(1 + z) < 0.8, and the
dashed curves are derived from the ﬁtting results in the three-dimensional case.

– 12 –

Our simulation results agree qualitatively with the observational results based on the orien-
tations of central galaxies (see e.g. Zhang et al. 2013). However, the alignments obtained here
are much stronger than that based on central galaxies, as is expected because central galaxies are
not perfectly aligned with their host halos. Indeed, as shown in Kang et al. (2007), in order to
reproduce the alignment between the satellite distribution and the central galaxy orientation, cen-
tral galaxies have to have certain misalignment with their host halos (see also Wang et al. 2008).
Moreover, as shown in Shi et al. (2015), the inner part of a halo, which may be more relevant to
the properties of central galaxy (e.g. Wang et al. 2014b), is less strongly correlated with tidal ﬁeld
than the outer part.

In observations, the spin axis of a spiral galaxy is usually obtained from the axis ratio of its
image, assuming that the disk is intrinsically round and that the spin axis is perpendicular to
the disk. Since it is usually unknown which side of the disk is closer, namely the sign of the z
component of the spin vector is not determined, a given axis ratio corresponds to two vectors with
opposite signs for the z-component (e.g. Tempel et al. 2013). To account for such uncertainty,
we deﬁne two spin directions for each halo, j+ ≡ j = (j1, j2, +j3) and j− ≡ (j1, j2,−j3), where jl
(l = 1, 2, 3) are the three components of the halo spin vector. The observed alignment should be
the mean values averaged over the alignments of the two vectors.

Fig. 8 shows the mean values between h|j− · tk|i and h|j+ · tk|i as functions of halo mass and
ν. The spin vectors deﬁned in this way still tend to be parallel with t2 and perpendicular to t1,
but the strengths of the alignments are reduced in comparison to the full three dimensional cases,
as is expected. As in the full three-dimensional case, for a given halo mass, the alignment of the
projected spin with t2 depends strongly on redshift, but the dependence can be eliminated if ν is
used instead of halo mass.

Recently, Zhang et al. (2015) performed similar analyses and found h|j±·tk=1,2,3|i = 0.500, 0.508, 0.488

for halos of masses ∼ 1012 h−1M⊙ and 0.477, 0.519, 0.497 for halos of masses ∼ 1013 h−1M⊙, in good
agreement with our results. 1 As shown in Zhang et al. (2015), the predicted halo spin - tidal tensor
alignments are stronger than the observed results derived from disk galaxies, but the disagreement
can be mitigated if spins of the inner parts of halos are used in the model predictions.

5. Alignments on large scales

Alignments of halo orientations on large scales (e.g. Hopkins et al. 2005; Lee et al. 2007)
are important to understand, because such alignments may produce galaxy-galaxy alignments on
large scale, thereby aﬀecting the interpretations of gravitational lensing results (e.g. Heavens et al.
2000; Jing 2002; Heymans et al. 2004). As described above, halos show strong alignments with
their local tidal tensors (halo-tidal tensor alignments). If the tidal tensors at locations separated

1Note that they used t3 to denote the stretching direction and t1 to denote the compressing direction.

– 13 –

by large distances are aligned too (tide - tide alignments), then halo-halo alignments on large scales
may be understood as a result of these two kinds of alignments. In this section we investigate these
large-scale alignments, ﬁrst (in §5.1) focusing on the tide-tide alignments, and then (in §5.2) on
halo-halo alignments on large scales.

5.1. Alignments of tidal tensors on large scales

We ﬁrst investigate the tide-tide alignments at the locations of halo pairs as a function of the
pair separation (in co-moving scale). Fig. 9 shows the results at four diﬀerent redshifts, which are,
respectively, the lowest redshift snapshot in each of the four redshift bins used above, and for two
halo mass bins, 12 ≤ log Mh/h−1M⊙ < 13 and 13 ≤ log Mh/h−1M⊙ < 14. In the larger mass bin,
the number of halos at z = 3.1 is too small to give reliable results, and so the corresponding results
are not shown.

There are several interesting trends. (i) The alignment signal decreases with increasing separa-
tion and become marginally important at distances of 20 - 30 h−1Mpc. (ii) The signal is stronger for
massive halos, which may reﬂect the fact that more massive halos are more likely associated with
larger structures. (iii) The signal strengthens with decreasing redshift. This may be due to the fact
that large-scale structures become more prominent as the universe evolves. (iv) The minor axes of
the tidal ﬁeld are the most strongly aligned, followed by the major axes and then the intermediate
axes. If the two halos are located within the same large-scale ﬁlament, the major axes of the tidal
ﬁelds around these halo are expected to be aligned because both of the tidal tensors tend to align
with the ﬁlaments, as is consistent with our results. However, in this case it is unclear why the
minor axes of the tidal tensors have the strongest alignment. It may be that most halo pairs on
large scales are not located within the same ﬁlamentary structure, but in two ﬁlaments that are
embedded in the same sheet-like structure. Since the minor axes of the tidal ﬁelds are perpendicular
to the sheet plane, strong alignments in the minor axes can be produced. For the same reason, the
alignments of the major axes may be weakened by cross pairs between two ﬁlaments. Thus, our
results may reﬂect the consequence of the dynamic nature of the cosmic web, in which halos are
embedded in ﬁlaments which, in turn, are embedded in sheets.

To make connections to observations, we show in Fig. 10 the alignments of Tk, the projections
of tidal tensors at the locations of halo pairs. Here we see again that the alignments can extend to
very large scales. Using the group catalog of Yang et al. (2007), Lim et al. (2016, in preparation)
have estimated the two-dimensional tide-tide alignments as a function of separations between galaxy
groups, and found results that are very similar to what we ﬁnd here. For example, the mean
alignment angle of T1 (T3) for groups of log Mh/h−1M⊙ ≥ 12.5 is about 35◦ (30◦) at a separation
of 3 h−1Mpc, and approaches ∼ 45◦ at > 20 h−1Mpc, in good agreement with our results. The
details of the comparison between our model predictions and observational results are presented in
Lim et al. (2016).

– 14 –

5.2. Halo-halo alignments on large scales

Fig. 11 shows the halo-halo alignment as a function of halo pair separation. Signiﬁcant
alignments are seen only for i1 and i3. The alignments are stronger on smaller scales, vanishing at
separations of 10 - 20 h−1Mpc. The alignments are also stronger at higher redshift and for more
massive halos. Lee et al. (2008) measured the ellipticity correlation function and found the same
dependence on redshift and halo mass as we ﬁnd here (see also Hopkins et al. 2005).

In order to facilitate comparison with observation, we also present the two dimensional results
in Fig. 12. For massive halos at z = 0, the mean angles at ∼ 3 h−1Mpc are 44◦ ± 0.4 for I1 and
43◦±0.8 for I3. At higher redshift, the results are much noisier because of the much smaller number
of halos that can be used. For low mass halos, the mean angle at ∼ 3 h−1Mpc is about 44.5◦, with
high signiﬁcance for both I1 and I3. Signiﬁcant alignments can be seen at least to ∼ 10 h−1Mpc.
At z ∼ 3, the mean angles at the smallest scale can reach 43◦.

It is interesting to compare the halo-halo alignments with the tide-tide alignments and the
halo-tide alignments obtained above. First, the dependence of the halo-halo alignment on halo
mass and separation is very similar to that of the tide-tide alignment, but the strength of halo-
halo alignment is much weaker than the corresponding tide-tide alignment. Second, the alignments
of the major and minor axes of halos have similar strength. This is in contrast to the tide-tide
alignment, which is the strongest for minor axis, but similar to the halo-tide alignment. Third,
the halo-halo alignment for the intermediate is absent, which is diﬀerent from both the tide-tide
and halo-tide alignments. This may be due to the rather weak alignment between the intermediate
axes of halo and tidal ﬁeld. Finally, the halo-halo alignment increases with increasing redshift, in
contrary to the tide-tide alignment. However, this is in agreement with the halo-tide alignment,
which strengthens with increasing redshift for a given halo mass. All these together suggest that
the halo-halo alignments on large scales are produced by the alignments of halos with local tidal
ﬁelds combined with tide-tide alignments on large scales.

6. Summary

The spin and orientation of galaxies and dark matter halos are found to be aligned with the
cosmic web. Such alignments are important for the interpretations of gravitational weak lensing
observations, as well as for understanding the formation of galaxies in the cosmic density ﬁeld. In
this paper, we investigate in detail how various alignments of dark matter halos depend on redshift
and halo mass, using simulated halos with masses above 1012 h−1M⊙ in the redshift range of log(1+
z) ≤ 0.8. We use the large-scale tidal ﬁeld, estimated from the halo population, to characterize the
cosmic web. The tidal ﬁeld tensors at halo locations are diagonalized to obtain the corresponding
eigenvectors, t1, t2 and t3 (major, intermediate and minor axes), with t1 corresponding to the
stretching direction of the tidal force, and t3 the compressing direction.

– 15 –

We ﬁnd that the major, intermediate and minor axes (i1, i2 and i3) of halos are aligned with t1,
t2 and t3, respectively. In particular, all the three alignments generally strengthen with increasing
halo mass and redshift. There are also signiﬁcant diﬀerences among the three alignments. The halo
mass dependence for major axis is stronger at lower redshift but absent at high redshift, while the
results for the other two axes are almost independent of redshift.

We also investigate the alignment of halo spin (j) with the local tidal ﬁeld, and ﬁnd that the
spin axis tends to be parallel with t2 and perpendicular to t1, but the alignment with minor axis is
weak. The strengths of the alignment with t2 and anti-alignment with t1 both increase with halo
mass and redshift.

We ﬁnd that once alignments are analyzed for halos of diﬀerent peak heights, ν ≡ δc

σ(Mh,z) , the
dependence on redshift in both the ik-tk(k = 1, 2, 3) and j-t2 alignments disappear, suggesting that
the dependence on halo mass and redshift is only through ν. We provide accurate ﬁtting formulae
to describe the distributions of the cosine of the alignment angles as functions of ν. The scaling
relations with ν for the four alignments, i1-t1; i2-t2; i3-t3 and j-t2, exhibit a similar two-phase
behavior, in that the alignment ﬁrst strengthens with increasing ν and then remains roughly at
a constant strength above a transition scale of ν. We suggest that this is due to the fact that
halo formation preserves the alignment between halo propers and the large scale tidal ﬁeld in the
linear ﬁeld, as long as the the large-scale structures remain in the quasi-linear regime, and that
non-linear evolution tends to suppress the alignment. This scenario also explains why the transition
scales for the three axes are diﬀerent, being the largest for minor axis, along which nonlinear eﬀects
start to operate earlier, and the smallest for major axis, along which nonlinear eﬀects are the least
important.

In order to facilitate comparisons with observations, we also investigate the alignments taking
into account projection eﬀect. The overall trends are similar to those in the three dimensional
results, except that the strengths of the alignments are reduced by projection.

Finally, we investigate the origin of the halo-halo alignments on large scales. We ﬁnd that the
orientations of the tidal tensors are correlated on scales up to about 30 h−1Mpc. This, together
with the alignments of halos with local tidal tensors, implies that halo-halo alignments should also
extend to large scales. Our direct measurements of the halo-halo alignments conﬁrm this, and
the halo mass and redshift dependencies of the halo-halo alignments can be explained by similar
dependencies in the tide-tide alignment and/or in the halo-tide alignment.

Our results demonstrate that the large-scale tidal ﬁeld produced by the large-scale mass distri-
bution in the universe plays a key role in generating the various alignments observed in numerical
simulations. Since the large-scale tidal ﬁeld can now be reconstructed from large redshift surveys
of galaxies (e.g. Wang et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2014a). Our results can, therefore, be used to
understand and model the alignments of galaxies and galaxy systems in the cosmic web. We will
come back to this in a future paper.
