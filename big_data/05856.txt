ABSTRACT
This paper explores the possibility of determining the spin of the supermassive black
hole (SMBH) in Sgr A*, by using secondary images of stars orbiting the SMBH. The
photons propagate close to the SMBH and their trajectories probe the space time in a
region where the spin of the SMBH is important. We ﬁnd the appearance of spikes in
the secondary image, which depends on the angular momentum and spin axis of the
SMBH and study the speciﬁc case of the star S2 in detail. The spikes has a magnitude
of ∼ 29 in the K-band and the required angular resolution is of order 15-20 µas. The
combination of these two requirements poses an extreme observational challenge, but
might be possible with interferometric observations in the sub-mm regime. The next
possible time frame for observing this eﬀect on the star S2 is in the late 2017 and then
it repeats with the period of the star.

1 INTRODUCTION

The possible rotation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs)
have been a subject of much interest lately (Reynolds (2013);
Ang´elil & Saha (2014); Jiang et al. (2015); Christian & Loeb
(2015); Brink et al. (2015)). The SMBH in Sgr A* in the
center of the Milky Way galaxy is no exception but observa-
tional diﬃculties within the galaxy complicates the process.
In this paper we suggest a new approach to observe the pos-
sible rotation of the SMBH in the galactic centre.

Black holes in general are described by the Kerr metric
which describes a space time around a rotating spherically
symmetric mass-distribution. In the Kerr metric, a black
hole is fully described by its mass M and angular momen-
tum a. The masses of black holes are often straightforwardly
determined from the dynamics of stars and other objects in
the vicinity of the black hole - see e.g. Ghez et al. (2008);
Gillessen et al. (2009); Zuo et al. (2015), the rotation of
black holes, however, is harder to determine since it only af-
fects the metric close to the black hole event horizon (Melia
et al. (2001)). Previous works have determined the rotation
of SMBHs (Broderick et al. (2009); Reynolds (2013)) by ob-
serving the perturbing eﬀect of rotation on accretion ﬂow
or accretion discs around black holes (see also (Li & Bambi

(2014)) for an example of a rotating stellar-sized black hole)
and have indicated that SMBHs with masses in the region of
106 M(cid:12) have typical angular momenta near their maximally
allowed values by the Kerr metric (see however Broderick
et al. (2011) for a diﬀerent conclusion).

In the Milky Way there is overwhelming evidence that a
SMBH is associated with the object Sgr A* (see e.g. (Maoz
(1998)) for constrains on alternatives to a black hole in the
center of the galaxy). While the mass of the SMBH has been
determined accurately by observing orbits of stars around
the SMBH (Gillessen et al. (2009); Meyer et al. (2012);
Boehle et al. (2014)), the rotation has not yet been measured
precisely. Determining the rotation of the SMBH would give
clues of its origin (Moderski & Sikora (1996); Volonteri et al.
(2005)).

In this paper we investigate the use of secondary images,
deﬁned as images where light has traveled behind the black
hole, to probe the region of the spacetime around the SMBH
in the galactic centre. We focus on the secondary image of
the star S2 and determine its dependence on the angular
momentum and spin direction of the SMBH. The trajectory
of photons associated with this image propagate very near
to the SMBH and will thus be aﬀected by the metric close
to the black hole. Present day technology is insuﬃcient to
observe the secondary image of S2, however, future obser-
vational projects such as The Event Horizon Telescope may
have a suﬃciently large aperture to observe the secondary
image.

2 SIMULATION

The objective is to ﬁnd the temporal evolution of the loca-
tion and magnitude of secondary images of stars in the S-star
cluster orbiting the SMBH in the center of our galaxy. The
parameters for stellar orbits in the S cluster as well as mass
of and distance to the central SMBH will be taken from
(Gillessen et al. (2009))

MSMBH = (4.31 ± 0.06|stat ± 0.36|R0) · 106M(cid:12),
dSMBH = (8.33 ± 0.35)kpc,

where the largest uncertainty on the mass comes from the
uncertainty on the distance to the SMBH.

In the simulation, photons are propagated from the ob-
server through the lens (SMBH) to a grid where the data
are collected. This grid is designed such that the trajectory
of S2 lays on the grid.

To describe a rotating black hole we use the Kerr metric

which is given as,

ds2 = −(cid:16)

Σ

In this notation the following has been introduced,

Σ = r2 + a2 cos2 χ
∆ = r2 − rsr + a2

rs =

2GM

c2

.

In the metric we have three coordinates r, χ and ξ. The
metric is thus fully described by the mass M of the black hole
and the angular momentum per unit mass a = J
M . In this
notation rs is the Schwarzschild radius of the corresponding
non-rotating black hole. The cosmic censorship hypothesis
sets an upper limit to the rotation of a black hole to a <
rs
2 (Penrose (1969); Wald (1984)). The coordinate system
is constructed such that the angular momentum vector is
pointing towards χ = 0.

Photons are tracked back from the Sun to the SMBH
and stopped on an elliptic cylindrical grid. The grid is placed
such that the Sun and SMBH are on the central axis inside
the elliptical cylinder and the stellar orbit is on the surface
of the elliptical cylinder, shown on Fig. 1. We propagate the
photons backwards through the metric by use of the geodesic
equation,

where the Cristoﬀel symbols Γα

The Kerr metric and the non-zero Cristoﬀel symbols in the
Kerr metric can be found in e.g. Muller & Grave (2009).

As a technical detail, the angular momentum parameter
a has to change sign in the code, since the photons are being
propagated backwards in time.

We have two coordinate systems the one belonging to
the metric where the angular momentum is at χ = 0, and
one belonging to the galactic plane where the galactic plane
is at θ = π/2, see Fig.1. In Fig. 1 the direction of the angular

Figure 1. The direction of the angular momentum vector of the
SMBH is determined by the two angles φA and θA. In this ﬁgure
the galactic plane is the xy-plane and the solar system is ﬁxed
on the x axis at (r0, 0, 0). The cylindrical grid is shown in blue
and lies parallel to the axis between the SMBH and earth. The
cross section of the grid is made such that the stars orbit lies on
surface of the cylinder.

momentum is deﬁned by the angles φA and θA. In the sim-
ulation we always start from the sun (φ = 0 and θ = π/2).
This can be transformed into the coordinate system of ξ and
χ by using the angles θA and φA.

Magniﬁcation

By propagating one photon the position of the secondary
image can be determined. To ﬁnd the magniﬁcation of the
secondary image we propagate three photons. The magni-
ﬁcation is determined as the relation between the solid an-
gle of the image with and without the gravitational lensing,
so µ = Ω
. To ﬁnd this we propagate three photons back
Ω0
through the metric. The ﬁrst photon is propagated with an
initial direction of (bx, by), where (0, 0) is directly at the
black hole. The other two photons have initial directions of
(bx + δb, by) and (bx, by + δb), respectively, where δb (cid:28) bi.
After the ﬁrst photon is stopped at the cylindrical grid it
deﬁnes a new plane perpendicular to the vector between the
point and the black hole. The remaining two photons are
then stopped on that plane and we deﬁne the positions of
the two photons as (d1x, d1y) and (d2x, d2y), in a coordinate
system with the ﬁrst photon at (0, 0). We can then ﬁnd the
magniﬁcation by ﬁnding the eigenvalues of the matrix.

Figure 2. Four identical images displaying the position of the secondary and tertiary images in terms of declination and right ascension
for a black hole with a = 0 and a = 0.99, where the angular momentum vector is perpendicular to the galactic plane. The solid grey
line indicates the orbit of the secondary image for a = 0 and the black dots represent positions for the secondary and tertiary image
for a black hole with a = 0.99. The black dots form a line at the regions where the secondary image is at its peak. The position of the
secondary and tertiary images are overplotted with large red dots for four diﬀerent epochs in 2017. In image A the epoch is 2017.1 and
the secondary image sits at (1) and the tertiary image at (2). In B the epoch is 2017.3 and the secondary image sits at (1), the tertiary
image at (2) and an image at (3/4) appears with high luminosity, corresponding to the spike (3/4) in Fig 3. In C the epoch is 2017.5
and the secondary image sits at (1), the tertiary image at (2) and the image at (3/4) has split into two images at (3) and (4). Finally in
D the epoch is 2017.9 and the two images (1) and (2) have merged into a single image with high luminosity, corresponding to the spike
(1/2) in Fig 3, which disappears immediately thereafter. Image (3) is now the new secondary image, which subsequently follows in solid
line and becomes image (1) in image A. Image (4) is the new tertiary image and ends up as image (2) in image A. The magnitude of the
images can be seen in Fig 3 at the diﬀerent times.

3 RESULTS

Our numerical work simulates the eﬀects of a nonzero black
hole angular momentum on the secondary images. We look
for two such eﬀects, namely its eﬀect on the position of
the secondary image and its eﬀect on the magniﬁcation of
the secondary image. The behaviour of the secondary (and
higher order) images is, in general, very complicated, so as
a ﬁrst step we investigate the behaviour of the secondary
image when the angular momentum is perpendicular to the
galactic plane and a = 0.99. Fig. 2 shows the position of the
secondary (and tertiary) image at four diﬀerent epochs in
2017, and Fig. 3 shows the magniﬁcation of these images as
a function of time, when the angular momentum is perpen-
dicular to the galactic plane.

Initially in Fig. 2.A a secondary and tertiary image are
visible at point 1 and 2, respectively. In Fig. 2.B an image
appears at point (3/4). This image corresponds to the spike
(3/4) at 2017.3 in Fig. 3. Subsequently, this image splits
up into two images, resulting in a total of four images in
Fig. 2.C. These four images are visible as four separate lines
at the 2017.5 epoch in Fig. 3. The two original images (1)
and (2) then merge into a single image in Fig. 2.D and a
spike in Fig. 3 and then disappears. The new images (3)
and (4) subsequently become the new secondary and ter-
tiary image and with time becomes image (1) and (2) in
Fig. 2.A. Also visible in Fig. 3 is a large peak in the sec-
ondary image in 2018 and two smaller spikes in the tertiary
image in 2018-2019. These spikes will be important when we
test the dependence of the spin axis.

The most interesting signature is the appearance of the
two spikes in 2017, because they outshine possible secondary
images of a non-rotating black hole and reach a magnitude of
29. Another interesting eﬀect is the position of the secondary
image seen in Fig. 2, which turns away from the path of
image in the non-rotating case. We will test how these eﬀects
depends on the angular momentum parameter a and the
orientation of the angular momentum vector.

Figure 3. The magniﬁcation of the secondary images of S2. The
thin solid line shows the magniﬁcation of the secondary image of a
non-rotating black hole. The dots represents the images when a =
0.99. The numbers next to the lines corresponds to the numbers
in Fig 2: The spikes (1/2) and (3/4) correspond to the images at
the point (1/2) and(3/4) in Fig 2. The spike at (3/4) should be
understood as an image that suddenly appears and then splits up
into two separate images (3) and (4). While at the spike (1/2) the
images (1) and (2) meets and then disappears. The two spikes at
2019 are spikes in the magnitude of the tertiary image.

Figure 4. The time of the two peaks in the secondary image as
a function of the angular momentum paramater a of the SMBH.
The angular momentum vector is in this case perpendicular to the
galactic plane, and rotating in the same direction as the galaxy.

Figure 5. Here the time the secondary position diﬀers from that
of a non-rotating black hole is shown as a function of the angular
momentum parameter a. The spin direction is perpendicular to
the galactic plane and rotates the same way as the galaxy.

3.1 The spikes dependency on the the angular

momentum

The timing of the appearance of the two spikes can be seen
as a function of a in Fig 4. The spikes are very faint and
typically have a magnitude below 30 in the K-band as long
as they appear. However, when the spin is close to maximal
the magnitude can reach m ∼ 29, as demonstrated in Fig. 3.
It is possible to identify three qualitatively diﬀerent

cases for the spike structure:

tertiary image.

belonging to the tertiary image.

• Below a = 0.63 there are no spikes, just a peak of the
• In the region 0.63 < a < 0.90 there are two spikes both
• When a > 0.90 the secondary and tertiary images mix
at the two spikes, as demonstrated in Fig 3. The mixing of
the secondary and tertiary images happens when the time
interval between the two spikes starts to decrease (see Fig 4).

The spikes have proven to be robust to a variety of
changes in the spin direction. We ﬁnally note that the peak
magnitudes of the two spikes are hard to determine precisely
because of the steep gradient around the appearance of the
spike.

3.2 Change of position

Another eﬀect is the change of position of the secondary
image in Fig 2. There is a clear change of the path of the
secondary image when it bends inwards. To determine the
duration of this shift in position we deﬁne an angle between
the secondary image and compare to the secondary image for
a non-rotating black hole. We then deﬁne the duration of the
shift, Tgap, as the time interval where the diﬀerence between
the positions of the two images is larger than 45 degrees.

For the case of a = 0.99 and the angular momentum
perpendicular to the galactic plane Tgap = 4.7 years. In
Fig 5 Tgap can be seen as a function of a. It can be seen
that the time where the image is shifted increases with a
and below 0.85 the image is never shifted with more than
45 degrees.

The characteristic movement of the secondary image in
Fig 2 where the image moves away from the circular move-
ment of the a = 0 case happens when a > 0.90. This is
consistent with the threshold value for when the secondary
and tertiary image mix at the two spikes (1/2) and (3/4) in
Fig 3. And as shown in Fig 4 the value for when the time
between the two peaks starts to decrease. So the movement
of the secondary and tertiary image starts to deviate from
the a = 0 case when a > 0.90 and the two images starts to
mix. For 0.85 < a < 0.90 the image is shifted but remains
on the same track. It is also shifted for a < 0.85 but that
shift is below the chosen limit of 45 degrees.

Dependence of spin axis

To study the angular dependence of the gap more closely
we have ﬁxed the angular momentum parameter to a =
0.99 rs/2. The orientation of the spin axis was varied with
angles φA and θA over the entire parameter space, (0 ≤
φA ≤ 2π) and (0 ≤ φA ≤ π), see Fig 1. Where φA = 0 and
θA = 0 corresponds to a rotation axis perpendicular to the
galactic plane and rotating with the the galaxy, and φA = 0
and θA = π/2 corresponds to the angular momentum vector
pointing towards the solar system.

There is a large region around θA = 0 and φA = 0 where
there is a gap like the one in Fig 2, but there is another region
around θA = π/2 and φA = 2.0 where the gap is positioned
as in Fig 6. The images in Fig 6 also represent spikes in the
points (1/2) and (3/4). These two spikes are related to the
two small spikes around year 2019 in Fig 3. When the spin
axis is changed the secondary image starts to interact with
these two spikes instead of the two spikes in year 2017.

In Fig 7 the duration of the gaps is shown for all spin
orientations. For positive values the gap is positioned as in
Fig 2 and for negative values it is positioned as in Fig 6.
The magnitude of the secondary image is typically around
m ∼ 32− 35, except at the spikes, and thus requires extreme
sensitivity to observe. The maximal gap size is at φA = 1.00
and θA = 0.39, where the image is relocated for over 10
years.

positioned inside the diﬀuse region. They conclude that the
resolution should be below 0.1 µas. To observe the spikes a
similar resolution will be required.

Even if the required angular resolution can be reached
the telescopes also need a very high sensitivity. Of current
and planned telescopes GRAVITY and The Event Horizon
Telescope (EHT) have the highest resolution. GRAVITY can
observe in the K-band and can reach an angular resolution
of ∼ 10 µas (Eisenhauer et al. 2011).

EHT observe at sub-millimetre wavelengths and cur-
rently has an angular resolution of 15 µas. At sub-millimetre
wavelength it is, however, not possible to reach the angular
resolution of ∼ 0.1 µas with earth based telescopes because
the baseline is limited to the diameter of the Earth. If ob-
servations of these spikes become possible, spectroscopy of
the secondary image will still be necessary for conﬁrmation.
The exact times for the appearance the spikes from S2
depend on the angular momentum direction of the SMBH.
θA = 0 the spikes will occur in 2017 Fig 4. After that they
will occur every 16th year as the star orbits the SMBH.

5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The secondary images of S2 and other S stars directly probe
the space-time close to Sgr A*, which is necessary to inves-
tigate the spin of the SMBH.

Both the location and the magnitude of the secondary
image of the star S2 depends on the spin and spin axis of the
SMBH in SgrA*. The spikes can be used to put non-trivial
constraints on the angular momentum and spin direction of
the SMBH.

To further constrain the parameters of the SMBH other
S-stars could be used. They would likely be able to test
other regions of the parameter space of Fig 7. The variation
in the trajectories of the other stars mean that some will
have spikes with a brighter magnitude, thus being easier
to observe. We expect that the optimal trajectories have a
stellar plane that has a small angle with the line sight to the
solar system and optimally has the pericenter on the same
side of the black hole as the sun.

Figure 7. Here is shown the length of the gaps dependent of the
spin direction. If it is positive (red color scale) the gap is in the
place of Fig 2. If it is negative the gap is in the position of Fig 6.

4 OBSERVATIONS

Observations of the S-stars is usually done in the K-band
because of the large amounts of dust. To complicate the
observations of secondary images the Sgr A* has a diﬀuse
source of radiation (spanning the K-band). This, combined
with the faint magnitude of the secondary images, puts high
demands on both sensitivity and angular resolution of tele-
scopes in order to observe these images. Bozza and Mancini
(Bozza & Mancini 2005) discuss the requirements to observe
the tertiary image of S14 with a magnitude of K = 32.1, and

However, we stress that observing the spikes for any of

these stars will require a huge step forward in technology.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated how secondary im-
ages from stars in orbit of the SMBH in the Milky Way can
be used to examine the spin of the SMBH. Both the spin
parameter a and the spin axis of the SMBH in Sgr A* can
inﬂuence the secondary images. This paper focuses on the
secondary images of the star S2 as a worked example and
we have demonstrated the appearance of spikes in the sec-
ondary image when the SMBH rotates. The spikes have a
magnitude of ∼ 29 in the K-band. When the SMBH ro-
tates with the rest of the galaxy the spikes appear when the
spin parameter is large (a > 0.63). The spikes are robust to
changes to the spin direction. Another interesting eﬀect is
the change of the secondary images position.

Both features provide a very demanding observational
challenge, but they also provide a very direct probe of the
space time structure close to the central black hole of the
Milky Way.
