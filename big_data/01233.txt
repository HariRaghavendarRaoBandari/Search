We prove that if H is a ﬁrst order holomorphic Besov Hilbert space
on the unit ball of Cd, then the multiplier algebras of H and of
H ⊙ H coincide.

1. Introduction

Let d be a positive integer and let R =Pd

denote the radial
derivative operator. For s ∈ R the holomorphic Besov space Bs is
deﬁned to be the space of holomorphic functions f on the unit ball Bd
of Cd such that for some nonnegative integer k > s

|(I + R)kf (z)|2(1 − |z|2)2(k−s)−1dV (z) < ∞.

Here dV denotes Lebesgue measure on Bd. It is well-known that for
any f ∈ Hol(Bd) and any s ∈ R the quantity kf kk,s is ﬁnite for some
nonnegative integer k > s if and only if it is ﬁnite for all nonnegative
integers k > s, and that for each k > s k·kk,s deﬁnes a norm on Bs, and
that all these norms are equivalent to one another, see [2]. For s < 0
one can take k = 0 and these spaces are weighted Bergman spaces.
In particular, B−1/2 = L2
a(Bd) is the unweighted Bergman space. For
s = 0 one obtains the Hardy space of Bd and one has that for each k ≥ 1

probability measure on ∂Bd. We also note that for s = (d − 1)/2 we

d , the Drury-Arveson space. If d = 1 and s = 1/2, then

Let H ⊆ Hol(Bd) be a reproducing kernel Hilbert space such that
1 ∈ H. The weak product of H is denoted by H ⊙ H and it is deﬁned
to be the collection of all functions h ∈ Hol(Bd) such that there are
i=1 kfikHkgikH < ∞ and for all

i=1 fi(z)gi(z).

We deﬁne a norm on H ⊙ H by

sequences {fi}i≥1, {gi}i≥1 ⊆ H with P∞

fi(z)gi(z) for all z ∈ Bd) .

In what appears below we will frequently take H = Bs, and will use
the same notation for this weak product.

Weak products have their origin in the work of Coifman, Rochberg,
and Weiss [5].
In the frame work of the Hilbert space H one may
consider the weak product to be an analogue of the Hardy H 1-space.
For example, one has H 2(∂Bd) ⊙ H 2(∂Bd) = H 1(∂Bd) and L2
a(Bd) ⊙
L2
a(Bd), see [5]. For the Dirichlet space D the weak product
D ⊙ D has recently been considered in [1], [4], [9], [6], and [7]. The
space H 2
d was used in [10]. For further motivation and general
background on weak products we refer the reader to [1] and [9].

a(Bd) = L1

d ⊙ H 2

Let B be a Banach space of analytic functions on Bd such that point
evaluations are continuous and such that 1 ∈ B. We use M(B) to
denote the multiplier algebra of B,

M(B) = {ϕ : ϕf ∈ B for all f ∈ B} .

The multiplier norm kϕkM is deﬁned to be the norm of the associated
multiplication operator Mϕ : B → B. It is easy to check and is well-
known that M(B) ⊆ H ∞(Bd), and that for s ≤ 0 we have M(Bs) =
H ∞(Bd). For s > d/2 the space Bs is an algebra [2], hence Bs = M(Bs),
but for 0 < s ≤ d/2 one has M(Bs) ( Bs ∩ H ∞(∂Bd). For those cases
M(Bs) has been described by a certain Carleson measure condition,
see [3, 8].

It is easy to see that M(H) ⊆ M(H ⊙ H) ⊆ H ∞ (see Proposition
3.1). Thus, if s ≤ 0, then M(Bs) = M(Bs ⊙ Bs) = H ∞. Furthermore,
if s > d/2, then Bs = Bs ⊙ Bs = M(Bs) since Bs is an algebra. This
raises the question whether M(Bs) and M(Bs ⊙ Bs) always agree. We
prove the following:

Theorem 1.1. Let s ∈ R and d ∈ N.
M(Bs) = M(Bs ⊙ Bs).

If s ≤ 1 or d ≤ 2, then

Note that when d ≤ 2, then Bs is an algebra for all s > 1. Thus
for each d ∈ N the nontrivial range of the Theorem is 0 < s ≤ 1. If
d = 1 then the theorem applies to the classical Dirichlet space of the
unit disc and for d ≤ 3 it applies to the Drury-Arveson space.

2. Preliminaries

For z = (z1, ..., zd) ∈ Cd and t ∈ R we write eitz = (eitz1, ..., eitzd)
and we write hz, wi for the inner product in Cd. Furthermore, if h is a
function on Bd, then we deﬁne Ttf by (Ttf )(z) = f (eitz). We say that
a space H ⊆ Hol(Bd) is radially symmetric, if each Tt acts isometrically
on H and if for all t0 ∈ R, Tt → Tt0 in the strong operator topology as
t → t0, i.e.
if kTtf kH = kf kH and kTtf − Tt0f kH → 0 for all f ∈ H.
For example, for each s ∈ R the holomorphic Besov space Bs is radially
symmetric when equipped with any of the norms k · kk,s, k > s.

It is elementary to verify the following lemma.

Lemma 2.1. If H ⊆ Hol(Bd) is radially symmetric, then so is H ⊙ H.

Note that if h and ϕ are functions on Bd, then for every t ∈ R we
have (Ttϕ)h = Tt(ϕT−th), hence if a space is radially symmetric, then
Tt acts isometrically on the multiplier algebra. For 0 < r < 1 we write
fr(z) = f (rz).

Lemma 2.2. If H ⊆ Hol(Bd) is radially symmetric, and if ϕ ∈ M(H⊙
H), then for all 0 < r < 1 we have kϕrkM (H⊙H) ≤ kϕkM (H⊙H).

Proof. Let ϕ ∈ M(H ⊙ H) and h ∈ H ⊙ H, then for 0 < r < 1 we have

ϕrh =Z π

Thus, kϕrkM (H⊙H) ≤ kϕkM (H⊙H).

3. Multipliers

The following Proposition is elementary.

Proposition 3.1. We have M(H) ⊆ M(H ⊙ H) ⊆ H ∞ and if ϕ ∈
M(H), kϕkM (H⊙H) ≤ kϕkM (H).

As explained in the Introduction, the following will establish Theo-

rem 1.1.

Theorem 3.2. Let 0 < s ≤ 1. Then M(Bs) = M(Bs ⊙ Bs) and there
is a Cs > 0 such that

kϕkM (Bs⊙Bs) ≤ kϕkM (Bs) ≤ CskϕkM (Bs⊙Bs)

for all ϕ ∈ M(Bs).

Here for each s we have the norm on Bs to be k · kk,s, where k is the

smallest natural number > s.

Proof. We ﬁrst do the case 0 < s < 1. Then k = 1, and kf k2

Bs =
|(I + R)f (z)|2dVs(z), where dVs(z) = (1 − |z|2)1−2sdV (z). For later

Since kϕf k2

|ϕ(z)(I + R)f (z) + f (z)Rϕ(z)|2dVs(z) it is clear
that kϕkM (Bs) is equivalent to kϕk∞ + kRϕkCa(Bs). Thus, it suﬃces to
show that there is a c > 0 such that kRϕkCa(Bs) ≤ ckϕkM (Bs⊙Bs) for all
ϕ ∈ M(Bs ⊙ Bs).

Let ϕ ∈ M(Bs ⊙ Bs) and let 0 < r < 1. Then for all f ∈ Bs we have

f 2, ϕrf 2 ∈ Bs ⊙ Bs, hence

|f |2|Rϕr|2dVs =ZBd

≤ 4kϕkM (Bs⊙Bs)kf k2

BskRϕrkCa(Bs).

Next we take the sup of the left hand side of this expression over all f
with kf kBs = 1 and we obtain kRϕrk2
Ca(Bs) ≤ 4kϕkM (Bs⊙Bs)kRϕrkCa(Bs)
which implies that kRϕrkCa(Bs) ≤ 4kϕkM (Bs⊙Bs) holds for all 0 < r < 1.
Thus, for 0 < s < 1 the result follows from Fatou’s lemma as r → 1.

If s = 1, then kf k2

proceeds as above.
