Abstract—In this paper, a novel approach for joint power
control and user scheduling is proposed for optimizing energy ef-
ﬁciency (EE), in terms of bits per unit energy, in ultra dense small
cell networks (UDNs). Due to severe coupling in interference,
this problem is formulated as a dynamic stochastic game (DSG)
between small cell base stations (SBSs). This game enables to
capture the dynamics of both the queues and channel states of the
system. To solve this game, assuming a large homogeneous UDN
deployment, the problem is cast as a mean-ﬁeld game (MFG)
in which the MFG equilibrium is analyzed with the aid of low-
complexity tractable partial differential equations. Exploiting the
stochastic nature of the problem, user scheduling is formulated
as a stochastic optimization problem and solved using the drift
plus penalty (DPP) approach in the framework of Lyapunov
optimization. Remarkably, it is shown that by weaving notions
from Lyapunov optimization and mean-ﬁeld theory, the proposed
solution yields an equilibrium control policy per SBS which
maximizes the network utility while ensuring users’ quality-
of-service. Simulation results show that the proposed approach
achieves up to 70.7% gains in EE and 99.5% reductions in the
network’s outage probabilities compared to a baseline model
which focuses on improving EE while attempting to satisfy the
users’ instantaneous quality-of-service requirements.

I. INTRODUCTION

Wireless network densiﬁcation is viewed as a promising
approach to enable a 1000x improvement in wireless cellular
network capacity [1]–[4]. Indeed, 5G systems are expected to
be ultra-dense in terms of transmitters and receivers rendering
network optimization highly complex [2] and [5]. In such ultra
dense network (UDN) environments, resource management
problems, such as power control and user equipment (UE)
scheduling, become signiﬁcantly more challenging due to the
scale of the network [2], [6]. In addition, the spatio-temporal
trafﬁc demand ﬂuctuations in the network, the dynamics in
channel conditions, and the increasing overhead due to the

need for coordination will further exacerbate the challenges of
resource management in UDNs. For instance, the uncertainties
in terms of queue state information (QSI) and channel state
information (CSI) as well as their evolution over time will
play a pivotal role in resource optimization.

Due to the involvement of large number of devices and
the severe coupling of their control parameters with one an-
other, the current state-of-the-art approaches used in classical,
small scale network deployments are inadequate to study
the resource optimization in UDNs. Thus, power control,
UE scheduling, interference mitigation, and base station (BS)
deployment strategies for energy-efﬁcient UDN have been
recently investigated in a number of works such as [1] and
[5]–[11]. The work in [6] investigates the potential gains
and limitations of energy efﬁciency (EE) for outdoor UDNs
considering small cells idle mode capabilities and BS/UE
densiﬁcation. In [7], an analytical framework was proposed for
designing UDNs that maximizes EE by modeling the network
using stochastic geometry and obtaining new lower bound on
the average spectral efﬁciency. The authors in [8] investigate
how different BS and antenna deployment strategies, for both
indoor and outdoor UDNs, can impact EE. In [9], a power
control and UE scheduling mechanism is proposed for UDN
of clustered small cells which have access to a database
consisting signal-to-noise ratio values of each BS-UE link.
The work in [10] proposes an optimization framework which
allows ﬂexible UE association among densely deployed BSs
by minimizing the signaling overhead. The authors in [11]
study how to improve EE of an UDN by jointly optimizing
the resource utilization and the temporal variances in the
trafﬁc load. These studies provide valuable insights of both
performance gains and limitations of UDNs. However, most
of these works [6]–[10], ignore uncertainties in QSI, do not
properly model network dynamics, and typically focus on
the problems of UE scheduling and resource allocation in
isolation. Instead, in practice, there is a need to treat those
problems jointly while accounting for the QSI dynamics and
uncertainty. Moreover, none of these existing works study the
behavior of the ultra dense system setting in which the number
of BSs and UEs grows inﬁnitely large.

Recently, mean-ﬁeld games (MFGs) received signiﬁcant
attention in the context of cellular networks with large number
of players [12]–[16]. In MFGs, a large population consists
of small
interacting individual players and their decision
making strategies are studied [12], [13]. Due to the size of
the population, the impacts of individual states and decisions
are negligible while the abstract behavior of the population is

modeled by a mean-ﬁeld (MF). As a result, the MF regime
allows to cast the multi-player problem into a more tractable
single player problem which depends on the state distribution
of the population. In [14], concurrent packet transmissions
among large number of transmitter-receiver pairs with the
objective of minimizing transmit power under the uncertainties
of QSI and CSI are investigated using MFGs. The authors
in [15] study an energy efﬁcient power control problem in mul-
tiple access channels whereas transmitters strategies depend
on their receivers, battery levels and the strategies of others.
In [16], a competition of wireless resource sharing among
large number of agents is investigated as an MFG. Despite
their interesting analytical perspective, these existing works
remain limited to traditional macrocellular networks and do
not address the challenges of small cell networks. Moreover,
for simplicity, these works consider models with a single UE
per BS or they address multi-user scenarios with conventional
UE scheduling schemes (proportional-fair, round-robin, ﬁrst-
in-ﬁrst-out). Thus, the opportunity to improve the proposed
solutions for multi-user cases by smart UE scheduling has not
been treated yet.

The main contribution of this paper is to propose a novel
joint power control and user scheduling mechanism for ultra-
dense small cell networks with large number of small cell base
stations (SBSs). In the studied model, the objective of SBSs
is to maximize their own time average energy efﬁciency (EE)
in terms of the amount of bits transmitted per joule of energy
consumption. Due to the ultra-dense deployment, severe mu-
tual interference is experienced by all SBSs and thus, must be

When considering multiple UEs associated with SBS, UE
scheduling directly affects the performance of each SBS. Due
to the dynamic nature of channels and arbitrary arrivals, the
UE scheduling process becomes a stochastic optimization
problem [17]–[20]. To solve such stochastic optimization
problems while ensuring queue stability, the dual-plus-penalty
(DPP) theorem from the Lyapunov optimization framework
can be used [17]–[22]. Lyapunov DPP approach simpliﬁes
the stochastic optimization problem into multiple subproblems
which can be solved at each time instance. Remarkably, this
simpliﬁcation ensures the convergence to the optimal solution
of the original stochastic optimization problem [17]–[20]. The
work in [19] presents a utility optimal scheduling algorithm
for processing networks based on Lyapunov DPP approach.
In [21], Lyapunov DPP method is used to solve stochastic
optimization problem with non-convex objective functions.
In [22], a Lyapunov DPP framework is used to dynamically
select service nodes for multiple video streaming UEs in a
wireless network. It can be noted that the Lyapunov DPP
approach is a powerful tool for solving stochastic optimization
problems. However,
the above technique in
decentralized control mechanisms, i) the objective function
should be chosen such that it can be decoupled among the
control nodes as in [19] or ii) necessary bounds need to be
identiﬁed for the coupling term as the authors in [22] evaluate
a lower bound for the capacity in order to mitigate coupling
due to interference. Therefore, a suitable method to make
an accurate evaluation on the coupled term (interference in
wireless UDNs) needs to be investigated.

properly managed. To this end, SBSs have to compete with
one another in order to maximize their EEs while ensuring
UEs’ quality-of-service (QoS). This competition is cast as a
dynamic stochastic game (DSG) in which players are the SBSs
and their actions are their control vectors which determine the
transmit power and user scheduling policy. Due to the non-
tractability of the DSG, we study the problem in the mean-ﬁeld
regime which enables us to capture a very dense small cell
deployment. Thus, employing a homogeneous control policy
among all the SBSs in the network, the solution of the DSG
is obtained by solving a set of coupled partial differential
equations (PDEs) known as Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB)
and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equations [12]. The
resulting equilibrium is known as the mean-ﬁeld equilibrium
(MFE). We analyze the sufﬁcient conditions for the existence
of an MFE in our problem and we prove that all SBSs
converge to this MFE. Exploiting the stochastic nature of the
objective with respect to QSI and CSI, the UE scheduling
procedure is modeled as a stochastic optimization problem.
To ensure the queue stability and thus, UE’s QoS, the UE
scheduling problem is solved within a DPP-based Lyapunov
optimization framework [17], [22]. An algorithm is proposed
in which each SBS schedules its UEs as a function of CSI,
QSI and the mean-ﬁeld of interferers. Remarkably, it is shown
that combining the power allocation policy obtained from the
MFG and the DPP-based scheduling policy enables SBSs to
autonomously determine their optimal transmission parameters
without coordination with other neighboring cells. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work combining MFG and
Lyapunov frameworks within the scope of UDNs. Simulation
results show that the proposed approach achieves up to 70.7%
gains in EE and 99.5% reductions in the network’s outage
probabilities compared to a baseline model which improves
EE while satisfying users’ instantaneous quality-of-service
requirements.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
presents the system model, formulates the DSG with ﬁnite
number of players and discusses the sufﬁcient conditions to
obtain an equilibrium for the DSG. In Section III, using the
assumptions of large number of players the DSG is cast as
a MFG and solved. The solution for UE scheduling at each
SBS based on DPP framework is examined in Section IV. The
results are discussed in Section V and ﬁnally, conclusions are
drawn in Section VI.

II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM DEFINITION

Consider a downlink of an ultra dense wireless small cell
network that consists of a set of B SBSs B using a common
spectrum with bandwidth ω. These SBSs serve a set M of
M UEs. Here, M = M1 ∪ ··· ∪ MB where Mb is the set
of UEs served by SBS b ∈ B. For UE scheduling, we use a
scheduling vector λb(t) =(cid:2)λbm(t)(cid:3)∀m∈Mb
for SBS b where
λbm(t) = 1 indicates that UE m ∈ Mb is served by SBS b at
time t and λbm(t) = 0 otherwise. The channel gain between
UE m ∈ Mb and SBS b at time t is denoted by hbm(t) and an
additive white Gaussian noise with zero mean and σ2 variance

is assumed. The instantaneous data rate of UE m is given by:

rbm(t) = ωλbm(t) log2(cid:18)1 +

Ibm(t) + σ2 (cid:19),
pb(t)|hbm(t)|2

(1)

b

(3)

where pb(t) ∈ [0, pmax
] is the transmission power of SBS
b, |hbm(t)|2 is the channel gain between SBS b and UE m,
Ibm(t) =(cid:80)∀b(cid:48)∈B\{b} pb(cid:48)(t)|hb(cid:48)m(t)|2 is the interference term.
We assume that SBS b sends qbm(t) bits to UE m ∈ Mb.
Thus, the time evolution of the b-th SBS queue, is given by:
(2)
where ab(t) and rb(·) are the vectors of arrivals and transmis-
sion rates at SBS b and is the vector of channel gains. More-
over, a vector of control variables Y (t) = (cid:2)yb(t), y−b(t)(cid:3)
is deﬁned such that yb(t) = (cid:2)λb(t), pb(t)(cid:3) is the SBS local

dqb(t) = ab(t) − rb(cid:0)t, Y (t), h(t)(cid:1)dt,

control vector and y−b(t) is the control vector of interfering
SBSs. The evolution of the channels are assumed to vary
according to the following known stochastic model [23]:

dhb(t) = G(cid:0)t, hb(t)(cid:1)dt + ζdzb(t),

where the deterministic part hb(t)(cid:1) = [G(cid:0)t, hbm(t)(cid:1)]m∈M

considers path loss and shadowing while the random part
zb(t) = [zbm(t)]m∈M with positive constant ζ includes fast
fading and channel uncertainties. The evolution of the entire
system can be described by the QSI and the CSI as per (2) and

(3), respectively. Thus, we deﬁne x(t) =(cid:2)xb(t)(cid:3)b∈B ∈ X as
the state of the system at time t with xb(t) =(cid:2)qb(t), hb(t)(cid:3)
over the state space X = (X1 ∪ ··· ∪ XB). The feasibility set
of SBS b’s control at state x(t) is deﬁned as Yb(cid:0)t, x(t)(cid:1) =
{λbm(cid:0)t, x(t)(cid:1) ∈ {0, 1}, 0 ≤ pb(cid:0)t, x(t)(cid:1) ≤ p
}. Note that
we will frequently use Y (t) instead Y(cid:0)t, x(t)(cid:1) for notational
simplicity. As the system evolves, UEs need to be scheduled
at each time slot based on QSI and CSI. The service quality
of UE is ensured such that the average queue of packets
intended for UE m ∈ Mb at its serving SBS b is ﬁnite, i.e.
¯qbm = limt→∞ 1
τ =0 qbm(τ ) ≤ ∞.

Furthermore, we assume that SBSs serve their scheduled
UEs for a time period of T . Therefore, we use the notion
of time scale separation between transmit power allocation
and UE scheduling processes, hereinafter. For SBS b ∈ B,
the transmit power allocation pb(t) is determined for each
transmission and thus, is a fast process. However, UE schedul-
ing λb(t) is ﬁxed for a duration of T to ensure a stable

than power allocation.

A. Resource management as a dynamic stochastic game

We focus on ﬁnding a control policy which solves (4) over a
time period [0, T ] for a given set of scheduled UEs considering
the state transitions x(0) → x(T ). Therefore, we deﬁne the
following time-and-state-based utility for SBS b:

Γb(cid:0)0, x(0)(cid:1) = Γb(cid:0)0, x(0), Y (0)(cid:1)

= E(cid:2)(cid:90) T

fb(cid:0)τ, x(τ ), Y (τ )(cid:1)dτ(cid:3).

(5)

The goal of each SBS is to maximize this utility over yb(τ ) =

(cid:2)λ(cid:63)
b (τ ), pb(τ )(cid:3) for a given UE scheduling λ(cid:63)(τ ) subject to
the system state dynamics dx(t) = X tdt + X zdz(t), ∀b ∈
B,∀m ∈ M where:
X t =(cid:104)abm(t) − rbm(cid:0)t, Y (t), h(t)(cid:1), G(cid:0)t, hbm(t)(cid:1)(cid:105)m∈M,b∈B,

and X z = diag(0|M|, ζ1).

As the network state evolves as a function of QSI and
CSI, the strategies of the SBSs must adapt accordingly. Thus,

maximizing the utility Γb(cid:0)0, x(0)(cid:1) for b ∈ B under the

evolution of the network states can be modeled as a dynamic
stochastic game (DSG) as follows:

Deﬁnition 1: For a given UE scheduling mechanism, the
power control problem can be formulated as a dynamic
stochastic game G = (B,{Yb}b∈B,{Xb}b∈B,{Γb}b∈B) where:
• B is the set of players which are the SBSs.
• Yb is the set of actions of player b ∈ B which encompass
the choices of transmit power pb for given scheduled UEs
λb.
• Xb is the state space of player b ∈ B consisting QSI qb
and CSI hb.
• Γb is the average utility of player b ∈ B that depends on
the state transition x(t) → x(T ) as follows:

Γb(cid:0)t, x(t)(cid:1) = E(cid:2)(cid:82) T

t fb(cid:0)τ, x(τ ), Y (τ )(cid:1)dτ(cid:3).

One suitable solution for the deﬁned DSG is the closed-loop
Nash equilibrium (CLNE) deﬁned as follows:

as a CLNE. We denote by Γ(cid:63)(cid:0)t, x(t)(cid:1) =(cid:2)Γ(cid:63)

To satisfy (7), each SBS must have the knowledge of its own
state xb(t) and a feedback on the optimal strategy y(cid:63)−b(t) of
the rest of SBSs and thus, the achieved equilibrium is known

trajectories of the utilities induced by the NE. The existence
of the NE is ensured by the existence of a joint solution

Solving |B| mutually coupled HJB equations is complex
when |B| > 2. Furthermore, it requires gathering QSI and
CSI from all the SBSs throughout the network which incurs

4

a tremendous amount of information exchange. Hence,
it
is impractical for UDNs with large |B|. However, as |B|
grows extremely large, it can be observed that the set of
all players transform into a continuum and their individuality
becomes indistinguishable. In such a scenario, we can solve
the dynamic stochastic game using the tools of mean-ﬁeld
theory, as explained next.

III. OPTIMAL POWER CONTROL: A MEAN-FIELD

APPROACH

As the number of SBSs becomes large (|B| → ∞), we
assume that the interference tends to be bounded in order
to have non-zero rates as observed in [14], [15] and [27].
Moreover, each SBS implements a transmission policy based
on the knowledge of its own state. SBSs in such an environ-
ment are indistinguishable from one another thus, resulting
in a continuum of players. This is a reasonable assumption
in UDNs because the impact of an individual SBS’s decision
on the system is negligible from the macroscopic view unless
such a decision is adopted by a considerable large portion of
the population. As an example, the choice of a SBS to increase
its energy consumption by 1 Watt in a system consisting
of thousands of SBSs consuming couple of megawatts is
insigniﬁcant. However, it is a signiﬁcant increment of energy
consumption if the same decision is made by 10% of the
population together. Remarkably, increasing the number of
SBSs inﬁnitely large and allow them to become a continuum
allows us to simplify the solution of all |B| HJB equations by
reducing them to two equations as discussed below.
At a given time and state(cid:0)t, x(t)(cid:1) and for a scheduled UE
m, the impact of other SBSs on the choice of a given SBS
b ∈ B appears in the interference term:
Ibm(cid:0)t, x(t)(cid:1) =(cid:80)∀b(cid:48)∈B\{b} pb(cid:48)(cid:0)t, x(t)(cid:1)|hb(cid:48)m(t)|2.

As the number of SBSs grows large, we consider that the in-
terference is bounded as shown in [27]–[29] and [30] since the
path loss is modeled according to the inverse-square law. Thus,
the interference term can be rewritten by using a normalization
factor for the channels [27]. Let η/|B| be the normalization
factor where η is SBS density and thus, the channel gain
√
η˜hbm(t)√|B| with E [|˜hbm(t)|2] = 1. Thus,
becomes hbm(t) =
the interference can be rewritten as (12) with a SBS state

distribution ρ|B|(t) = [ρ|B|(cid:0)t, x(cid:48))]x(cid:48)∈X where
δ(cid:0)xb(t) = x(cid:48)(cid:1).
Here, δ(·) is the Dirac delta function and x(cid:48)
∈ X .
Now, we assume that each SBS has only the knowledge
of its own state and, thus, it will implement a homogeneous
transmission policy, i.e. pb(cid:0)t, x(t)(cid:1) = p(cid:0)t, xb(t)(cid:1) for all b ∈
B, based the knowledge that it has available. Furthermore,
0 p2(cid:0)t, xb(t)(cid:1)dt] < ∞.
the transmission policy satisﬁes E [(cid:82) T
With the above assumptions, the SBS states x1(t), . . . , x|B|(t)
for all t become exchangeable under the transmission policy
p [31], [32], i.e.,
L(cid:0)x1(t), . . . , x|B|(t)(cid:1) = L(cid:0)xπ(1), . . . , xπ(|B|)(cid:1)

converges to a ﬁnite value which depends on ρ|B|(t). With
the convergence of the interference along the indistinguishable
transmission policy and SBS states, the DSG G converges to
an MFG [33]. A simpliﬁed illustration of the system is shown
in Fig. 1.

Thus, the utility maximization problem and the evolution of

the states are reformulated for a generic SBS as follows:

maximize

(cid:0)p(t)|λ(cid:63)(t)(cid:1),∀t∈[0,T ]

subject to

(18a)

Γ(cid:0)0, x(0)(cid:1),

dx(t) = Xtdt + Xzdz(t), (18b)
(18c)

In the MF framework,

Γ(y(cid:63), ρ(cid:63)) ≥ Γ(y, ρ(cid:63)).

for all t ∈ [0, T ] where Xt =(cid:2)D(cid:0)t, y(t)(cid:1), G(cid:0)t, ˜h(t)(cid:1)(cid:3) and a
diagonal matrix Xz = diag(0, ζ1). Here, D(cid:0)t, y(t)(cid:1) = a(t)−
r(t, y(t), ˜h(t), ρ(t)(cid:1). Similarly, the utility of a generic SBS
Γ(cid:0)t, ˘x(t)(cid:1) follows (6) with the necessary modiﬁcations. The
formal deﬁnition of the MF equilibrium is as follows:
Deﬁnition 3: The control vector y(cid:63) = (λ(cid:63), p(cid:63)) ∈
Y(cid:0)t, x(t)(cid:1) constitutes a mean-ﬁeld equilibrium if, for all
y ∈ Y(cid:0)t, x(t)(cid:1) with the MF distribution ρ(cid:63), it holds that,
solution(cid:2)Γ(cid:63)(cid:0)t, ˘x(t)(cid:1), ρ(cid:63)(cid:0)t, ˘x(t)(cid:1)(cid:3) of (18) is equivalent to the
NE of the |B|-players DSG [12]. Moreover, the optimal tra-
jectory Γ(cid:63)(cid:0)t, ˘x(t)(cid:1) is found by applying backward induction
to a single HJB equation and the MF (limiting distribution)
ρ(cid:63)(cid:0)t, ˘x(t)(cid:1) is obtained by forward solving the FPK equation
p(t,˘x(t)) (cid:20)Xt
p(cid:63)(cid:0)t, ˘x(t)(cid:1) = arg max

Solving (19)-(20) yields the behavior of a generic SBS in terms
of transmission power, utility and state distribution.

The main motivation behind this mean-ﬁeld analysis is to
reduce the complexity of the B-player DSG. To solve the orig-
inal DSG with B SBSs/players presented in Section II-A, one
must solve B HJB PDEs given by (8). However, the solution of
the MFG with large B can be found by simply solving the two
coupled HJB-FPK PDEs rather solving B coupled HJB PDEs
as in the original problem. Clearly, this reduces complexity
considerably and can scale well with the number of players.

Fig. 1. Mean-ﬁeld interference from the perspective of an SBS. As the
number of interfering SBSs grows large, the interference observed at a generic
UE becomes independent of individual states and transmission policies of
SBSs and only depends on the time t and the limiting distribution ρ(t).

where L(·) is any joint rule of the SBS states and π(·)
produces any permutation over {1, . . . ,|B|}. Due to this
exchangeability, the game G now consists of a set of generic
players including a generic SBS with the state ˘x(t) at time
t. Thus, the interference under the homogeneous transmission
policy p with respect to the state distribution ρ|B|(t) will be
given by:

As |B| → ∞, the set of players becomes a continuum. Since
the transmission policy p(cid:0)t, ˘x(t)(cid:1) preserves the indistinguish-
able property (exchangeability in SBS states), there exists a
limiting distribution ρ(t) such that [15], [33],

This limiting distribution of the states is deﬁned as the MF.
Furthermore, when E [|˜hbm(t)|2] = 1, the channel gain

i.e.

for UE scheduling are proportional fair (PF) scheduling in
terms of rates, best-CSI based UE scheduling, and scheduling
based on highest QSI [18], [19], [34] and [35]. PF scheduling
ensures the fairness among UEs in terms of their average rates
(history) while the latter methods exploit the instantaneous
CSI or QSI. Using such conventional schedulers for solving
(4) within a UDN context will not properly account for the
inherent CSI and QSI dynamics over space and time, thus
yielding poor performance. Therefore, we solve the original
utility maximization problem of SBS b ∈ B with respect to
the scheduling variables as follows;

of SBSs in the system. The plot consists of a set of results for different number
of SBSs over a ﬁxed area of 0.5625 km2

could be challenging to solve the HJB-FPK coupled PDEs
for small number of SBSs and thus, the proposed method
is not applicable for highly sparse networks. As the number
of SBSs increases, the solution of the DSG tends towards
the solution of the MFG. Therefore, for dense to ultra dense
networks, the complexity of the proposed method is much
lower compared to solving the original B-player DSG. In fact,
the complexity of the proposed method remains constant for
all large B. Fig. 2 illustrate the complexity of the proposed
method by the number of iterations needed to solve the HJB-
FPK coupled PDEs for different number of SBSs. Here, it can
be observe that for systems with large number of SBSs, the
MFE is achieved by a small number of iterations and thus, the
complexity remains ﬁxed.

IV. UE SCHEDULING VIA LYAPUNOV FRAMEWORK
By using time scale separation, the scheduling variables
are decoupled from the mean-ﬁeld game and thus, can be
optimized separately. Some of the existing baseline approaches

(4b), (4c),

λb(t) ∈ L(cid:0)t, x(t)(cid:1)

Here, the feasible set L(cid:0)t, x(t)(cid:1) consists of all the vectors
with λbm(t) ∈ [0, 1] and 1†λb(t) = 1. Note that the scheduling
variables are relaxed from integers to real numbers for the
ease of analysis. Furthermore, we consider UE m ∈ Mb is
expected to be served by SBS b with a data rate of ˆrbm(t) =
λbm(t)˜rbm(t).

Proposition 2: Given that

the transmit power proﬁle

p(cid:63)(cid:0)t, ˘x(t)(cid:1) and the state distribution ρ(cid:63)(t), the expected data
rate of UE m ∈ Mb at time t is calculated as follows:

assuming that UE m is scheduled by SBS b.

p(cid:63)(cid:0)t, xb(t)(cid:1)|˜hbm(t)|2
I(cid:0)t, ρ(cid:63)(t)(cid:1) + σ2 (cid:19),

˜rbm(t) = ω log2(cid:18)1 +
Proof: As discussed in Section III, as |B| → ∞, all
SBSs will follow the optimal transmission policy given in
(20). Moreover, solving (19) yields the MF ρ(cid:63)(t) and thus, the
expected interference becomes I(cid:0)t, ρ(cid:63)(t)(cid:1). For any given time

t, since all the SBSs aware of their own states, the knowledge
of qb(t) and hbm(t) is available at SBS b. Therefore, as UE
m is scheduled by SBS b, the data rate given in (1) becomes
(22).

(22)

In order to solve the stochastic optimization problem (21)
per SBS b, the drift plus penalty (DPP) approach in Lyapunov
optimization framework can be applied [17], [20]. The Lya-
punov DPP approach decomposes the stochastic optimization
problem into sub-policies that can be implemented in a dis-
tributed way. Therefore, |B| copies of problem (21) are locally
solved at each SBS and, thus, the proposed solution can apply
for a large number of SBSs i.e., as |B| → ∞.
First, a vector of auxiliary variables υb(t) =(cid:2)υbm(t)(cid:3)m∈Mb
is deﬁned to satisfy the constraints (21c). These additional
variables are chosen from a set V = {υ|υ†1 = 1 and 0 (cid:22)
υ (cid:22) 1} independent from both time and state. Thus, (21) is

To satisfy the constraint

virtual queues Υbm(t) for each associated UE m ∈ Mb. The
evolution of virtual queues will follow [17];

Υbm(t + 1) = Υbm(t) + υbm(t) − λbm(t).

Modifying (2) considering a chunk of time, the evolution
of the queue of UE m ∈ Mb can be reformulated as

It can be noted that the feasible set is a convex hull. Due to

optimality of the scheduling.

The Lyapunov DPP method ensures that the gap between
the time average penalty and the optimal solution is bounded
by the term K|V | [18], [20], and [22]. Thus, the optimality of the
solution is ensured by the choice of a sufﬁciently large |V |.
The interrelation between the MFG and the Lyapunov opti-
mization is illustrated in Fig. 3 and UE scheduling algorithm
which solves (23) is given in Algorithm 1.

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS

For simulations,

the dimensions of

the problem must
be simpliﬁed in order to solve the coupled PDEs using
a ﬁnite element method. We used the MATLAB PDEPE
time t
solver for this purpose. The utility of an SBS at
is to
maximize the average expected energy efﬁciency deﬁned as

entire simulation and p0 is the ﬁxed circuit power consumption
at an SBS [24]. We assume that channels are not
time-
varying and thus, the state is solely deﬁned by the QSI1.

Γ(cid:0)T, x(T )(cid:1) = −4 exp(cid:0)x(T )(cid:1) is to encourage the scheduled

follow a Gaussian distributions with means 0.5 and variance
0.1. The choice of the ﬁnal utility, the boundary condition,

UE to obtain an almost empty queue by the end of its
scheduled period T . The arrival rate A(t) for a UE is modeled
as a Poisson process with a mean of ¯A = 200 kbps. For
simulations, the QSI is normalized by the queuing capacity
of an SBS which is assumed to be Qmax = 10 ¯A kb. More-
over, for simulations we assume that the transmit power is
p ∈ [0, 1] Watts, the circuit power consumption is p0 = 1 Watt,
and the variance of Gaussian noise is σ2 = −70 dBm. The
system parameters and channel models are based on [37].
The proposed method is compared to a baseline method
which uses a proportional fair UE scheduler and an adaptive
transmission policy. Similar to the proposed method, SBSs
in the baseline method seek to maximize EE by optimizing
the transmit powers. However,
in the baseline, SBSs are
not able to optimize their control parameters over the states
due to the fact that they are oblivious to the states of the
rest of the network. Thus, the SBSs in the baseline method
adopt a myopic approach in which they seek to maximize

the instantaneous EE 1†r(t)/(cid:0)p(t) + p0) by optimizing p(t)

for each t subject to UEs’ instantaneous QoS requirement.
Moreover, each SBS needs to estimate the interference in order
to solve its optimization problem. Here, we assume that SBSs
use the time average interference from their past experience
and consider it as a valid estimation for the interference. The
SBS density of the system is deﬁned by the average inter-
site-distance (ISD) normalized by half of the minimum ISD,
i.e. 1 unit of ISD implies an average distance of 20 m. The
B while during the discussion
average load per SBS is k = M

the theoretical contribution. Furthermore, even under non-fading channels, the
provided results can model the ergodic behavior of the system.

load for k = 5 UEs per SBS. Once a UE is scheduled, 100
transmissions will take place within the time period of T = 1.

A. Mean-ﬁeld equilibrium of the proposed model

Fig. 4 shows the MF distribution ρ(cid:63)(t, q), which represents
the evolution of the QSI distribution of scheduled UEs over
time at the MF equilibrium. During the period of T = 1,
SBSs transmit to their scheduled UEs and expect to achieve
a QSI close to zero by t = T as shown in Fig. 4a. Noted
that, by the end of the transmission phase, the number of
scheduled UEs with high QSI decreases thus, allowing the
SBSs to schedule a new set of UEs by the next UE scheduling
phase. Here, the queues for all UEs will buildup whether
they are scheduled or not due to the continuous arrivals with
mean ¯A at their respective serving SBSs. As the queue grows
beyond an SBS’s capacity Qmax (i.e. QSI > 1), the arrivals
are dropped and thus, the associated UE will suffers from an
outage. Therefore, achieving a QSI almost close to zero for a
scheduled UE provides the opportunity to build up its queue
over a large period thus contributing to a reduction in the
outage probability. In Fig. 4b, we can see that the fraction
of queues with q(t) = {0.2, 0.4, 0.8} vanishes before the

Comparison of the behavior of EE and outage probabilities for

transmission duration ends. As time evolves, the queues get
empty based on the rates prior to new arrivals and thus, an
oscillation is observed for the queue fractions with q(t) = 0.4
while q(t) = 0 exhibits a monotonic increase.

The transmit power policy at the MF equilibrium is shown
in Fig. 5. It can be observed that a higher transmit power is
needed when the QSI is high and this power can be reduced at
low QSI, showing the overall EE of the proposed approach. At
t = 0, a moderate transmit power is used even for UEs with
high QSI. Thus, SBSs prevent unnecessary interference within
the system. As the scheduling period arrives to an end, we

recall that the choice of Γ(cid:0)T, x(T )(cid:1) = −4 exp(cid:0)x(T )(cid:1) forces

SBSs to obtain smaller QSI at t = T . For UEs with low QSI,
SBSs use moderate transmit power to maximize EE. However,
for UEs with high QSI, SBSs use higher transmit power to
provide high data rates in order to empty their respective
queues as well as preventing outages. Thus, as time evolves,
SBSs increase their transmit power for UEs with high QSI as
illustrated in Fig. 5b thereby improving the ﬁnal utility.

B. Energy efﬁciency and outage comparisons

In Fig. 6a, we show the EE of the system in terms of the
number of bits transmitted per joule of energy consumed as

a function of ISD. Here, the load represents the number of
UEs served by an SBS. For a dense network (ISD = 3.5), the
proposed method will improve EE of about 5% compared to
the baseline model with k = 2. However, as the load increases
to k = 5, this EE improvement will reach up to 48.8%. These
improved EE for the dense scenario shown in the proposed
approach is due to its ability to adapt to the dynamics of
the network, as enabled by the stochastic game formulation
and its MF approximation. Naturally, as the network becomes
less dense,
the advantages of the proposed approach will
be smaller. For instance, for a non-dense network with an
ISD = 6.5 and k = 5 UEs per SBS, performance advantages
of the MF approach decreases to 4.8% as shown in Fig. 6a. For
a very lightly loaded and non-dense network, such as when
ISD = 6.5 and k = 2 UEs per SBS, the use of the baseline
method will be slightly more advantageous when compared to
the proposed approach. This advantage is of about 14.1% of
improvement in the EE.

Fig. 6b illustrates the outage probability as a function of
ISD. Here, the outage probability is deﬁned as the fraction of
unsatisﬁed UEs whose arrivals are dropped due to limitations
the proposed
of the queue capacity. It can be noted that

to the adaptive nature of transmit power and the QSI aware
optimal UE scheduler. As the load per SBS decreases, UEs are
scheduled more often and it increases the average rate per UE.
Therefore, an improvement in EE is observed in both methods
as illustrated in Fig. 7a. Furthermore, as the rates increase, the
myopic approach of the baseline method becomes efﬁcient and
thus, for the dense network ISD = 3.5 with k = 2, EE gain
of the proposed method over the baseline method decreases to
4.8%. Moreover, for the sparse scenario with ISD = 5.75 and
k = 2, the EE of the baseline method exceeds the proposed
method in which an EE loss of 12.6% is observed in the
proposed method.

In Fig. 7b, we compare the outage probabilities for different
loads. In this ﬁgure, we can see that the outages increase for
both proposed and baseline methods as the load increases. Due
to the increased number of UEs, each UE has to wait longer
before it is scheduled. Thus, there is a higher chance that the
arrivals are dropped as the SBS queue capacity is exceeded
thus yielding further outages. These outages are low for sparse
networks but they become signiﬁcantly large for UDNs due
to the increased interference and low rates. Moreover, for a
low load scenario k = 2, Fig. 7b shows that the proposed
method reduces the outages by 91.8% and 92.2% compared
to the baseline model for ultra dense and sparse networks,
respectively. As the load increases to k = 6, although both
models experience high outages, the proposed model results in
33.7% and 87.6% outage reductions compared to the baseline
model for ultra dense (ISD = 3.5) and sparse (ISD = 5.75)
scenarios, respectively.

Based on the above discussion, it can be noted that higher
energy efﬁciency gains of the proposed method over the
baseline model are seen as the network become dense in both
SBSs and UEs. According to the network speciﬁcations given
in [38], a sparse network consists of about 10 SBSs/km2
(ISD = 12) each SBS serving 5 ∼ 10 UEs (K = {5, 10})
while a dense network has about 95 SBSs/km2 (ISD = 4) and
K = {5, 10}. This paper analyzes networks consisting of 60
SBSs/km2 (ISD = 6.5) with K = 1 UEs per SBS (close to
sparse as per [38]), 60 SBSs/km2 (ISD = 6.5) with K ≥ 3
UEs per SSBS (neither sparse nor dense networks), and 250
SBSs/km2 (ISD = 3.5) with K = 6 UEs per SBS (ultra-dense
compared to [38]). The results show that the proposed method
is applicable for networks with average densities to ultra-dense
networks.

C. Transmit power and UE rate comparisons

Fig. 8 presents the cumulative density functions (CDFs) of
SBS transmit powers and UE rates for a sparse scenario with
ISD = 5.75. Fig. 8a shows that the baseline method uses low
transmit power compared to the proposed method for a low
load with k = 2. The low load and the low interference in a
sparse scenario allows all SBSs in the baseline method to make
accurate estimations of the interferences. Thus, SBSs in the
baseline method can efﬁciently solve their instantaneous EE
maximization problem thus resulting in higher EE compared to
the proposed method. This advantage of the baseline method
reaches up to 43%. As the load increases, the baseline method

different loads.

Comparison of the behavior of EE and outage probabilities for

method uses smart UE scheduling and transmit power policy
based on QSI which ensures a higher UE QoS. Although the
baseline model optimizes the transmit power with the goal
of improving EE, it is unable to track the QSI dynamics and
adapt the UE scheduling accordingly. Thus, higher number
of UEs suffer from outages. As the network becomes highly
loaded and more dense (i.e., as the number of SBSs and UEs
increase), the number of UEs in outage will naturally increase
for both approaches. This is due to the increased interference
and the high average waiting time due to increased number
of UEs. From Fig. 6b, we observe that the proposed method
yields 91.8% and 41.8% reductions in outages compared to the
baseline model for both low and high loads, respectively, in
UDNs. For a sparse network, the outage reductions are 92.2%
and 99.5% for low and high loads, respectively.

Fig. 7a shows how EE varies with the number of UEs per
SBS (i.e., load). We can observe that the proposed method
shows higher EE gains for dense networks. For k = 6 UEs
per SBS and ISD = 3.5, the proposed method yields an EE
gain of 70.7% compared to the baseline model while reaching
20.3% as the network becomes sparse with ISD = 5.75. The
gains in the proposed method for dense scenarios are due

will begin to consume a higher amount of transmit power to
satisfy the QoS of UEs while the proposed method manges
to achieve its EE maximization goal with a small increase
in the transmit power. Thus, for highly loaded networks, the
proposed method exhibits a 20.5% reduction of the transmit
power over the baseline model. In Fig. 8b, we can also see
that the proposed method yields an improvement in the overall
UE rates, when compared to the baseline. This performance
advantage, in terms of rate, reaches up to 43.6% and 12.3%
for k = 2 and k = 5 UEs per SBS, respectively. Clearly, when
jointly considering EE and rates, the proposed approach pro-
vides a signiﬁcant overall improvement of UDN performance,
when compared to the baseline.

Fig. 9 presents the CDFs of SBS transmit powers and UE
rates for a dense scenario with ISD = 3.5. From Fig. 9a, it
can be observed that the proposed method uses low transmit
power and provides higher UE rates on the average compared
to the baseline model. For the low load k = 2, the average
transmit powers are 0.381 W and 0.397 W for the proposed
and baseline methods, respectively. To handle the excess load,
the respective average transmit powers increase to 0.49 W and
0.78 W as the load is increased to k = 5. Therefore, we can

see that the proposed method reduces the power consumption
by about 4% for low loads and 37.1% for high loads compared
to the baseline model, respectively. The average UE rates of
proposed and baseline methods are 0.41 bits/s/Hz and 0.33
bits/s/Hz for low loads while 0.18 bits/s/Hz and 0.17 bits/s/Hz
for high loads, respectively as shown in Fig. 9b. Thus, the
gains in proposed method over the baseline method are 24.4%
and 2.4% for low and high loads, respectively. These gains
validates the suitability of the proposed method on the dense
networks.

Based on the above comparisons, it can be observed that the
proposed method which adapts to the dynamics in the network
is able to reduce energy consumption while maintaining a
desirable balance between EE and data rate. Moreover, the
proposed approach is able to reduce the number of UEs that
are in outage due to the limitation on the SBS queue capacity.
For UDNs, the performance improvements become much more
signiﬁcant, reaching up to a 70.7% improvement in EE and up
to 33.7% reduction of outages. These results demonstrate that
the proposed solution can clearly turn the density of UDNs
into gains in terms of energy efﬁciency.

D. Impact of the boundary conditions

To derive a solution for the MF framework one must deal
with solving HBJ-FPK PDEs in which the ﬁnal solution will
depend on predeﬁned boundary conditions [12]. In this work,

At the end of the scheduling period, t = T , depending on
the QSI, a cost is introduced based on the above bound-
ary condition. The cost is minimum if the queue is empty

the choice of boundary condition is Γ(cid:0)T, ˘x(cid:1) = −4 exp(cid:0)˘x(cid:1).
(cid:0)x(T ) = 0(cid:1), and grows exponentially as QSI at T increases.

Thus, the choice of this boundary condition forces the SBSs
to obtain smaller QSI at t = T . To illustrate the impact
of the boundary condition, we compare a selected set of
i)
results for three different boundary conditions, namely,
exponential bound: the boundary condition used in the former

uniform bound: a boundary condition where the utility is

discussion, i.e. Γ(cid:0)T, ˘x(cid:1) = −4 exp(cid:0)˘x(cid:1) for ˘x ∈ [0, 1], ii)
uniform disregarding the ﬁnal QSI, i.e. Γ(cid:0)T, ˘x(cid:1) = −4 for
all ˘x ∈ [0, 1], and iii) linear bound: a boundary condition
where the utility forces QSI at t = T to be zero in a linear
manner, i.e. Γ(cid:0)T, ˘x(cid:1) = −4(e − 1)˘x − 4 for ˘x ∈ [0, 1].

These boundary conditions are illustrated in Fig. 10. Here, the
uniform bound is a relaxed boundary condition compared to
the original exponential boundary condition as it grants ﬁxed
utility disregarding the QSI at t = T . On the contrary, the
linear bound forces QSI at t = T to be even closer to zero
compared to the exponential bound and thus, can be considered
as a tighter boundary condition.

(b) With the uniform boundary.

The MF distributions for the above boundary conditions are
given in Fig. 11. It can be noted that with the uniform bound,
that a larger fraction of users with non-zero queues can be
seen compared to the exponential boundary. The main reason
is that the ﬁxed utility introduced by the boundary condition
does not force QSI to be zero by the end of the scheduling
period. On the contrary, the linear bound encourages to obtain
almost empty queues by t = T and thus, a large fraction of
UEs with zero queues can be observed.

Finally,

the comparison of EE and outage probabilities
for the above boundary conditions are illustrated in Fig. 12.
Here, compared to the exponential bound, the uniform bound

provides higher EE at the price of higher outage probabilities.
Relaxing the QSI at t = T allows SBSs to use low transmit
power and increase the EE. However, the accumulated queues
prevent further arrivals and thus, higher outage probabilities
can be observed. With the linear bound, all the data in the
queues are transferred to UEs by the end of the scheduling

However, to ensure the empty queues by t = T , SBSs use
higher energy to increase the data rates and thus, the EE is
reduced compared to the exponential bound.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have formulated the problem of joint
power control and user scheduling for ultra-dense small cell
deployment as a MFG under the uncertainties of QSI and
CSI. The goal is to maximize a time-average utility (energy
efﬁciency in terms of bits per unit power) while ensuring
users’ QoS concerning outages due to queue capacity. Under
appropriate assumptions, we have analyzed the equilibrium of
the MFG with the aid of low-complex tractable two partial
differential equations (PDEs). In conjunction the with mean-
ﬁeld approach, we have introduced a Lyapunov-based QSI and
CSI aware user scheduler. Using simulations, we have shown
that the proposed method provides considerable gains in EE
and massive reductions in outages compared to a baseline
model and thus, becomes a suitable candidate for future UDNs.
One key future extension for this work is to account explicitly
for SBS sleep mode optimization and adaptive cell association.
