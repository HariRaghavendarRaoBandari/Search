TAUBERIAN PROPERTIES FOR MONOMIAL SUMMABILITY WITH

APPLICATIONS TO PFAFFIAN SYSTEMS

SERGIO A. CARRILLO AND JORGE MOZO-FERN ´ANDEZ

Abstract. In this paper we will show that monomial summability processes with respect to
diﬀerent monomials are not compatible, except in the (trivial) case of a convergent series. We
will apply this fact to the study of solutions of Pfaﬃan systems with normal crossings, focusing
in the implications of the complete integrability condition on these systems.

1. Introduction

1xq

Monomial summability was introduced in [2] and used in order to study summability properties
of solutions of a class of singularly perturbed diﬀerential systems (doubly singular diﬀerential
systems), that are in some sense a generalization of the singularly perturbed diﬀerential equations
studied by Canalis-Durand, Ramis, Sch¨afke and Sibuya in [3]. It is a notion that needs further
development in order to treat other problems. For instance, monomial summability depends on
a particular monomial xp
2, and on the order of summability. Recall that in the classical, one
variable case, it is well known that if a formal power series is both k1− and k2− summable, then
it is convergent.

“m´elanger” divers processus de k-sommation (avec des k diﬀ´erents) est `a priori ´evidente pour des
raisons alg´ebriques ´el´ementaires [· · · ]. The result is shown, for instance in [6], and it is the starting
point of the fruitful theory of multisummability in one variable, and the key for establishing many
results concerning solutions of systems of diﬀerential equations with irregular singularities. So, it
turns out that a study of the relationship between monomial summability with respect to diﬀerent
monomials will be useful to treat new problems.

In fact, J.-P. Ramis, in the seminal paper [7] says that [...]

We will explore this situation in the present paper. One of the main results will be the following

one:
Theorem 3.9. Let xpj
series, for j = 1, ..., n. Then ˆf0 = ˆf1 + · · · + ˆfn is k0−summable in xp0
qj/q0 = k0/kj for all j = 1, ..., n.

Note that some conditions on the monomials have to be imposed in order to avoid trivial
situations. The technique of proof will be induction and blowing up the series, arriving at a
situation easier to work with. In some sense, this result is a ﬁrst step to motivate the introduction
of a theory of monomial multisummability, an issue that will be treated in a future work of the
authors.

This result is going to be applied in this paper to analyze Pfaﬃan systems with normal crossings,

i.e., systems as

= f1(x1, x2, y),

These systems were studied by H. Majima [5] under complete integrability condition, from the
point of view of strong asymptotic expansions. G´erard and Sibuya [4] studied a similar system,
when q = p′ = 0. Their main result is that, under complete integrability hypothesis, and assuming
the invertibility of the linear parts of the system, the only formal solution is in fact convergent
(Theorem 4.1 below). This result can be stated as a theorem on summability in the sense that a
series ˆf (x1, x2) k1−summable in x1 and k2−summable in x2, is in fact convergent.

Complete integrability condition is a very restrictive hypothesis in our situation. In fact, we will
show that for a great number of values of (p, q, p′, q′), complete integrability condition forbids the
linear parts of the system from being invertible. Moreover, we conjecture that this is always the
case, i.e., you can’t assume that any of the linear parts are invertible if (p, q) 6= (p′, q′). Apparently,
this fact hadn’t been noticed before by the diﬀerent authors that studied these systems. So, we
are forced to explore summability properties assuming that a formal solution exists, but without
assuming complete integrability condition.

The plan of the paper is as follows:

in Section 2, the main notions of summability, both in
one complex variable, and in the monomial case, are recalled. Tauberian Theorems about the
relationship among summability with respect to diﬀerent monomials, are shown in Section 3.
Finally, Section 4 will be devoted to the application of the previous results to the study of Pfaﬃan
systems, and to a precise analysis of the implications of assuming complete integrability condition
in these systems.

2. Summability

We recall brieﬂy the basic notions of asymptotic expansions, Gevrey asymptotic expansions and
summability in the case of one variable and their extensions to the monomial case in two variables,
as introduced in the paper [2].

Let (E, k · k) be a complex Banach space and ˆf =P anxn ∈ E[[x]]. We will denote by O(U, E)

(resp. Ob(U, E)) the space of holomorphic E−valued maps (resp. holomorphic and bounded
E−valued maps) deﬁned on an open set U ⊂ Cl. If E = C we will simply write O(U ). We also
denote by N the set of natural numbers including 0, by N>0 = N \ {0} and by Dr ⊂ C the disk
centered at the origin with radius r. Consider f ∈ O(V, E), where V = V (a, b, r) = {x ∈ C|0 <
|x| < r, a < arg(x) < b} is an open sector in C. The map f is said to have ˆf as asymptotic expansion
at the origin on V (denoted by f ∼ ˆf on V ) if for each of its proper subsectors V ′ = V (a′, b′, r′)
(a < a′ < b′ < b, 0 < r′ < r) and each N ∈ N, there exists CN (V ′) > 0 such that

(1)

f (x) −

≤ CN (V ′)|x|N ,

on V ′.

N −1Xn=0

anxn(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

If we can take CN (V ′) = C(V ′)A(V ′)N N !s, C(V ′), A(V ′) independent of N , the asymptotic
expansion is said to be of s−Gevrey type (denoted by f ∼s ˆf on V ). In this case ˆf ∈ E[[x]]s, where
E[[x]]s denotes the space of s−Gevrey series, i.e. there exist C, A > 0 such that kank ≤ CAnn!s,
for all n ∈ N.

TAUBERIAN PROPERTIES FOR MONOMIAL SUMMABILITY

Remark 2.1. For further use, we note that f ∼ ˆf (or f ∼s ˆf ) on V is equivalent to have
inequalities (1) only for N = M L, where M ∈ N∗ is ﬁxed and L ∈ N is arbitrary.
Remark 2.2. We also note that f ∼ ˆf on V if and only if there is R > 0 and a sequence
(fN )N ∈N ⊂ Ob(DR, E) satisfying that for every subsector W of V and N ∈ N there is CN (W ) > 0
such that

kf (x) − fN (x)k ≤ CN (W )|x|N ,

on W ∩ DR.

In the same manner, f ∼s ˆf on V if and only if the previous condition is satisﬁed with CN (W ) =
C(W )A(W )N N !s, for some C(W ), A(W ) independent of N , and there are constants B, D with
sup|x|≤R kfN (x)k ≤ DBN N !s, for all N ∈ N. In any case, ˆf is given by the limit of the Taylor
series at the origin of fN , in the m−topology of E[[x]].

Asymptotic expansions are unique, and respect algebraic operations and diﬀerentiation. Besides
f ∼s 0 on V if and only if for each proper subsector V ′ of V we can ﬁnd positive constants
C(V ′), A(V ′) such that

kf (x)k ≤ C(V ′) exp(cid:16)−A(V ′)/|x|1/s(cid:17) ,

on V ′.

From this inequality can be deduced Watson’s lemma that states that if f ∼s 0 on V (a, b, r)

and b − a > sπ then f ≡ 0. This is the key point to deﬁne k−summability, as is stated below.
Deﬁnition 2.1. Let ˆf ∈ E[[x]] be a formal power series, let k > 0 and let d be a direction.

(1) The formal series ˆf is called k−summable on V = V (a, b, r) if b − a > π/k and there exists
ˆf on V . If d is the bisecting direction of V then ˆf is
a map f ∈ O(V, E) such that f ∼1/k
called k−summable in the direction d and f is called the k−sum of ˆf in direction d (or on
V ).

(2) The formal series ˆf is called k−summable, if it is k−summable in every direction with

ﬁnitely many exceptions mod. 2π (the singular directions).

The algebra of k−summable series in the direction d will be denoted by E{x}1/k,d and the

algebra of k−summable series will be denoted by E{x}1/k.

The previous notions can be adapted to series in a monomial in several variables (two in our
case). The main idea is to let the monomial play the role of principal variable. Let p, q ∈ N>0
be ﬁxed and consider the monomial xp
2. For formal power series we may use the ﬁltration of
E[[x1, x2]] given by the sequence of ideals (xp

To ensure that each fn gives rise to an holomorphic map deﬁned in a common polydisc at

Ob(Dr, E)[[x2]].

In the analytic setting we use sectors in the monomial xp

1xq

2, i.e. sets of the form

Πp,q = Πp,q(a, b, r) =(cid:8)(x1, x2) ∈ C2 | 0 < |x1|p, |x2|q < r, a < arg(xp

1xq

2) < b(cid:9) .

Here any convenient branch of arg may be used. The number r denotes the radius, b − a the
opening and (b + a)/2 the bisecting direction of the sector.

We can construct an operator related to ˆTp,q for holomorphic maps deﬁned on monomial sectors.
To recall that construction we will focus ﬁrst in the case p = q = 1. We shall consider the
maps π1, π2 : C2 → C2 given by π1(x1, x2) = (x1x2, x2), π2(x1, x2) = (x1, x1x2), respectively,
corresponding to the point blow-up of the origin in C2. Note it is suﬃcient to work with π1. For
a sector Π1,1(a, b, r) is clear that

π1(Π1,1(a, b, r)) = {(t, x2) ∈ Dr2 × C | |t|/r < |x2| < r, a < arg(t) < b} .

Any f ∈ O(Π1,1, E), Π1,1 = Π1,1(a, b, r), induces a holomorphic map on π1(Π1,1) given by
(t, x2) 7→ f (t/x2, x2). For ﬁxed t with 0 < |t| < r2 the map x2 7→ f (t/x2, x2) is holomorphic in the
annulus |t|/r < |x2| < r and thus it has a convergent Laurent series expansion on x2:

More generally, if f satisﬁes |f (x1, x2)| ≤ K(|x1x2|) on Πp,q, for some function K : (0, r2) → R
then using Cauchy’s estimates we see that:

Note that f is determined by T1,1(f )ρ since T1,1(f )ρ(x1x2)(x1, x2) = f (x1, x2).

For the general case note that any f ∈ O(Πp,q, E), Πp,q = Πp,q(a, b, r), can be decomposed

uniquely as

f (x1, x2) = Xi<p and j<q

where fij ∈ O(Π1,1, E) for every i < p, j < q. For f bounded we can deﬁne Tp,q(f )ρ : V (a, b, ρ2) →

At this point we have the adequate frame to recall the notion of asymptotic expansion in a

SERGIO A. CARRILLO AND JORGE MOZO-FERN ´ANDEZ

There are diﬀerent characterizations of asymptotic expansions in a monomial, useful in certain
situations. For instance, f ∼(p,q) ˆf on Πp,q(a, b, r) if and only if Tp,q(f )ρ ∼ ˆTp,q( ˆf ) on V (a, b, ρ2),
for every 0 < ρ < r′. Here ˆTp,q ˆf ∈ E (p,q)
[[t]] and 0 < r′ < r. The result is also valid for asymptotic
expansions of s−Gevrey type. Indeed, if f ∼(p,q) ˆf on Πp,q(a, b, r) then applying (10) to (12) with
K(u) = uN +1 we obtain

Proposition 2.4. Let f ∈ O(Πp,q, E), Πp,q = Πp,q(a, b, r), be an holomorphic map. The following
assertions are equivalent:

(1) f ∼(p,q) ˆf on Πp,q,

if ˆTp,q( ˆf )ρ is k−summable (resp. k−summable in direction d) for all ρ small enough. With this
characterization it is possible to carry on known theorems of summability in our context.

For a ﬁxed (x1, x2) with |x1|, |x2| < 1, the radius of convergence of the above series is the
minimum between dist(u, 2πiZ) and dist(v, 2πiZ), where x1 = eu, x2 = ev and Re(u), Re(v) < 0.
The domain of deﬁnition of its analytic continuation ϕ is the set conformed by all the triples
(x1, x2, ξ) in C3 such that eξ 6= x1 and eξ 6= x2.

If we ﬁx 0 < ρ < r < 1 it follows that |ϕ(x1, x2, ξ)| ≤

ˆF is 1−summable in the space E (1,1)
only in directions d included in (−π/2, π/2). To calculate its
1−sum, for instance in direction d = 0, we calculate its Laplace transform given by

Thus the 1−sum f in x1x2 of ˆf in direction d = 0 is obtained by replacing t = x1x2 in the above
expression, and has domain of deﬁnition {(x1, x2) ∈ C2 | |x1|, |x2| < 1 and x1x2 6= −1/n, n ∈ N>0}.

In the example, ﬁnding the k−sum in xp

2 was possible studying the k−sum of the corresponding
series under the operator ˆTp,q. In general such computations are not so simple but fortunately the
sum can also be computed as the pk−sum (resp. qk−sum) of ˆf as a formal power series in x1 (resp.
x2) with coeﬃcients holomorphic maps on a sector in x2 (resp. x1) with small enough opening.

3. Tauberian properties for Summability

The goal of this section is to describe some tauberian theorems for monomial summability, for

instance, relate diﬀerent levels of summability for diﬀerent monomials.

In the context of one variable we have the following two statements that provide tauberian

properties for k−summability and that we will recover in the monomial case.

Proposition 3.1. Let ˆf ∈ E{x}1/k have no singular directions. Then ˆf is convergent.

Proposition 3.2 (Ramis). Let 0 < k < l be positive numbers. Then E[[x]]1/l ∩ E{x}1/k =
E{x}1/l ∩ E{x}1/k = E{x}.

As for a ﬁxed monomial, summability in the monomial is equivalent to summability in the

classical sense, we obtain immediately the following statements.

Proposition 3.3. If ˆf ∈ E{x1, x2}(p,q)

1/k has no singular directions then ˆf is convergent.
Proposition 3.4. Let 0 < k < l be positive real numbers. Then for any monomial xp

1/l = E{x1, x2}.

2 we have

We can extend the last proposition when the monomials involved are not necessarily the same.
Thereby we start by relating summability in a monomial with summability in some power of this
monomial.

Proposition 3.5. Let k > 0, let p, q, M ∈ N>0 and let d be a direction. Then E{x1, x2}(p,q)

The last element we need to generalize Proposition 3.4 is the behavior of monomial asymptotic
expansions under point blow-ups, i.e. with the composition with the maps π1, π2. Both the formal
and the analytic behavior are described in the next statements.

Lemma 3.6. Let ˆf ∈ E[[x1, x2]] be a formal power series. Then the following assertions are true:

(1) ˆf ∈ E{x1, x2} if and only if ˆf ◦ π1 ∈ E{x1, x2} if and only if ˆf ◦ π2 ∈ E{x1, x2}.
(2) ˆf ∈ E[[x1, x2]](p,q)

and have k−sums f ◦ π1, f ◦ π2 in direction d, respectively.

Proof. The result follows from Proposition 2.4. Indeed, if (fN ) is a family of bounded analytic
functions that provide the monomial asymptotic expansion to f then (fN ◦ πj ) will provide the
asymptotic expansion to f ◦ πj, j = 1, 2.

At this point we are ready to enounce and prove the main result so far, comparing summable

series in diﬀerent monomials.
Theorem 3.8. Let xp

and therefore ˆf are convergent.

then by Corollary 2.3, ˆTp,q( ˆf ) is a max{p/p′, q/q′}/l-

2. Take any ˆf ∈ E{x1, x2}(p,q)

1/k ∩ E{x1, x2}(p′,q′)

sitions 3.4 and 3.5. The cases max{p/p′, q/q′} < l/k and l/k < min{p/p′, q/q′} follow from (1).

Finally the case min{p/p′, q/q′} ≤ l/k ≤ max{p/p′, q/q′} can be reduced to the previous one

using point blow-ups. For instance, if p/p′ < l/k ≤ q/q′ take N ∈ N>0 such that

qk − q′l
p′l − pk

< N.

By Proposition 3.7 we see that ˆf ◦ πN
monomials satisfy max{p/p′, N p + q/N p′ + q′} < l/k and thus ˆf ◦ πN
3.6 ˆf is convergent as we wanted to prove.

but the new
1 is convergent. By Lemma
(cid:3)

The previous theorem can be generalized to any number of monomials to provide examples of

series non-k−summable in any monomial for any positive real number k.

Theorem 3.9. Let xpj
series, for j = 1, ..., n. Then ˆf0 = ˆf1 + · · · + ˆfn is k0−summable in xp0
qj/q0 = k0/kj for all j = 1, ..., n.

Proof. By induction on n. If n = 1 the statement is just Theorem 3.8, (2). Suppose the statement
is true for n − 1 and let us prove it for n. If pj/p0 = qj/q0 = k0/kj hold for all j = 1, ..., n then ˆf0
is k0−summable in xp0
and k0p0 ≤ ... ≤ knpn
(reindexing if necessary). The following situations cover all the possible cases:

2 . Conversely, assume that ˆf0 ∈ E{x1, x2}(p0,q0)

1/k0

I. Suppose the strict inequalities k0p0 < k1p1 < · · · < knpn and k0q0 < k1q1 < · · · < knqn
hold. Then ˆTp0,q0 ( ˆf0) is max{p0/p1, q0/q1}/k1−Gevrey and k0−summable in some E (p0,q0)
and thus ˆf0 is convergent by Theorem 3.2. Using the induction hypothesis on the series
ˆg0 = ˆf0 − ˆf1 and ˆgj = ˆfj+1, j = 1, ..., n − 1, we obtain a contradiction.

II. If k0p0 = · · · = knpn, we compare the numbers kjqj. When all kj qj are diﬀerent from
each other we can assume k0q0 < · · · < knqn, the series ˆfj ◦ π2 satisfy the hypothesis in
(I) and arguing as in that case we see that ˆf0 ◦ π2 and thus ˆf0 are convergent. Using
the induction hypothesis we obtain a contradiction. Otherwise kiqi = klql for some i 6= l,
E{x1, x2}(pi,qi)
and we can use the induction hypothesis to conclude
that k0q0 = kjqj for all j = 1, ..., n, as we wanted to show.

III. Suppose k0p0 < knpn and let i0 < i1 < · · · < im be the places where we have a strict
inequality, i.e. kil pil < kil+1pil+1 and if il + 1 ≤ j ≤ il+1 then kjpj = kil+1 pil+1 , for

il+1 are the same as the ones between kil+1qil+1, ..., kil+1 qil+1.

and consider the series ˆfj ◦ πN
j = N pj + qj. By the
election of N we have kil q′
il+1 for all l = 0, ..., m and the order relations between
kil+1q′
If for
some l two numbers among kil+1q′
il+1 are equal, the corresponding spaces
coincide and we can use the induction hypothesis to get a contradiction. If not, all the
numbers kil+1q′
il+1 are diﬀerent, for all l = 0, 1, ..., m and we can assume that
kil+1q′
il+1 , for all l = 0, 1, ..., m, where all the inequalities are strict. In
other words, we have arrive to the situation k0q′
n, where all the inequalities
are strict. Therefore the series ˆfj ◦ πN
1 ◦ π2 satisfy the hypothesis in (I) and arguing as
1 ◦ π2 and thus ˆf0 are convergent. Using the induction
in that case we see that ˆf0 ◦ πN
hypothesis we obtain a contradiction.

il+1 < · · · < kil+1q′

il+1,..., kil+1 q′

il+1, ..., kil+1 q′

0 < · · · < knq′

Since the only non-contradictory case occurs when pj/p0 = qj/q0 = k0/kj for all j = 1, ..., n the
(cid:3)

statement is true for n and the result follows from the principle of induction.

Given ˆf ∈ C, we can also consider the situation when ˆf is summable as a series in x1 or x2,
with coeﬃcients in Ob(DR, E) for some R > 0 and compare the summability phenomena we have
at our disposal. It turns out again that all the methods are incompatible and the proofs can be
reduced to Theorem 3.8 using blow-ups. The key statement is the following.

Proposition 3.10. If ˆf ∈ Ob(DR, E){x1}1/k,d has k−sum f in direction d then ˆf ◦π1 ∈ E{x1, x2}(1,1)
1/k,d,
ˆf ◦ π2 ∈ Ob(DR, E){x1}1/k,d and have k−sums f ◦ π1, f ◦ π2 in direction d, respectively.

for every subsector V ′ of V and every N ∈ N we can ﬁnd positive C, A such that

k−summable in x1x2 in direction d. For π2, if we consider the sector V (a, b, r′′), r′′ = r/R, and a

ˆf ◦ π2 on V (a, b, r′′) follows from Remark 2.2 and the proposition as
(cid:3)

Theorem 3.11. Let xp

2 be a monomial and let k, l > 0. The following statements hold:

(1) Ob(Dr, E){x1}1/k ∩ Ob(Dr, E){x2}1/l = E{x1, x2}.
(2) Ob(Dr, E){xj}1/k ∩ E{x1, x2}(p,q)

1/l = E{x1, x2}, for j = 1, 2.

Proof. For (1) take ˆf ∈ Ob(Dr, E){x1}1/k ∩ Ob(Dr, E){x2}1/l. Then by Propositions 3.7, 3.10 and
3.8, (2). we conclude that ˆf ◦ π1 ◦ π2 ∈ E{x1, x2}(2,1)
1/l = E{x1, x2} and clearly ˆf
is convergent. The proof for (2) is analogous.

Remark 3.12. The fact that a series in E[[x1, x2]], k−summable in x1 and l−summable in x2 is
convergent can be also deduced directly from the deﬁnitions, arguing as in [11]. As a matter of
fact, Y. Sibuya considered only series, solution of certain Pfaﬃan systems that we will recall in the
next section.

following integrability condition on their domains of deﬁnition:

with q = p′ = 0. If ∂f1
(0, 0, 0) are invertible then the Pfaﬃan system admits a
∂y
unique analytic solution y at the origin such that y(0, 0) = 0.

(0, 0, 0) and ∂f2
∂y

Sketch of proof. The ﬁrst proof of Theorem 4.2 can be found in [4]. Due to the nature of the result
Y. Sibuya reproved it with diﬀerent methods, see [11] for a proof using summability theory and
see [10], [12] for a proof in the linear case using algebraic tools. For a more recent proof the reader
may also consult [8]. Let us sketch a proof here for completeness, Let ˆy be the unique formal power
solution of equation (15a). Using the integrability condition it follows that ˆy is also solution of
equation (15b). By the general theory of summability, ˆy is p−summable in the variable x1 and
q′−summable in the variable x2. Then by Theorem 3.11 ˆy is convergent.
(cid:3)

In our context, the main result obtained by the authors in [2] is the following statement on

summability of formal solutions of doubly singular equations.

Theorem 4.3. Consider the singularly perturbed diﬀerential equation

εqxp+1 dy
dx

= f (x, ε, y),

If
(0, 0, 0) is invertible then the previous equation has a unique formal solution ˆy. Furthermore it

where y ∈ Cl, p, q ∈ N>0, f analytic in a neighborhood of (0, 0, 0) and f (0, 0, 0) = 0.
∂f
∂y
is 1−summable in xpεq.

We shall expect that this result joint with Theorem 3.8 lead to a direct generalization of Theorem
4.2. Unfortunately the hypothesis of complete integrability imposes serious restrictions on f1 and
f2, in particular in their linear parts, and the conditions imposed to generalize the theorem are
not satisﬁed. Indeed, a closer look to equation (16) leads us to the following result.

Theorem 4.4. Consider the Pfaﬃan system (15a), (15b). If it is completely integrable then the
following assertions hold:

(1) If p′ < p or q′ < q then A(0, 0) is nilpotent.
(2) If p < p′ or q < q′ then B(0, 0) is nilpotent.
(3) If p = p′ and q = q′, for every eigenvalue µ of B(0, 0) there is an eigenvalue λ of A(0, 0)
such that qλ = pµ. The number λ is an eigenvalue of A(0, 0), when restricted to its
invariant subspace {v ∈ Cl|(B(0, 0)) − µI)kv = 0 for some k ∈ N}.

Proof. We consider ﬁrst the particular case p = p′ and then we reduce the rest of them to this one
using for instance point blow-ups. Let us write

Multiplying by P (x2) to the left and by P (x2)−1 to the right, the equation obtained in the position
(1, 1) according to the previous block decomposition is

write y(x1, x2) = y0(xp

then eA, eB ∈ Mat(pl × pl, C{z1, x2}) are obtained from the system (15a), (15b) as follows:
then eA and eB correspond to the linear parts of the Pfaﬃan system satisﬁed by Y. It turns out

So we are in a similar situation as the initial equation (17) and we can apply the case p = p′ = 1.
If q < q′ then B0,0 is nilpotent and if and q = q′ then for each eigenvalue µ of B0,0 there is an
eigenvalue λ of A0,0 such that qλ = pµ, and the case (3) of the theorem has been proved.

The previous reasonings can be reproduced by starting with an arbitrary eigenvalue of λ0 and

also by changing the symmetric role of x1 and x2 in equation (16). Thus we have proved that:

16

SERGIO A. CARRILLO AND JORGE MOZO-FERN ´ANDEZ

a. If p = p′ and q < q′, or q = q′ and p < p′ then B0,0 is nilpotent,
b. If p = p′ and q′ < q, or q = q′ and p′ < p then A0,0 is nilpotent.

To ﬁnish the proof we treat the remaining cases as follows:

• Assume p < p′ and q < q′. We multiply equation (15a) by xq′−q

• Assume p < p′ and q′ < q. We take N ∈ N such that N > q−q′

in both sides to get a
completely integrable system where we can apply (a) to conclude that B0,0 is nilpotent.
The same argument works in the case p′ < p and q′ < q to conclude that A0,0 is nilpotent.
p′−p and consider the completely
integrable system given by (18a), (18b). By the previous item we conclude that B0,0 is
nilpotent. Now we take M ∈ N such that M > p′−p
q−q′ and consider the completely integrable
system given by (19a), (19b). By the previous item we conclude that A0,0 is nilpotent.
The case p′ < p and q < q′ follows in the same way. Note that in this case, both matrices
A0,0 and B0,0 are nilpotent.

(cid:3)

Remark 4.5. As a consequence of the previous result, if (p, q) 6= (p′, q′), at least one of the
matrices A0,0, B0,0 is nilpotent, and in many cases, both are. In fact, we conjecture that, in this
situation, always both matrices of the linear parts are nilpotent. It is worth to remark that H.
Majima in [5] using his theory of strongly asymptotic expansions has studied systems (15a), (15b)
and their generalization to more independent variables in the completely integrable case. We point
out that Theorem 4.4 reduces certain parts of these studies in the case of two variables exclusively
to trivial cases or highly degenerate ones. This fact apparently had not been noticed by H. Majima
or by other authors.

Using the tools we have developed here we can provide information on the solutions of systems
in the case of non-integrability . Indeed, we can prove easily the convergence of solutions under
generic conditions, when they exist. More speciﬁcally we have the following theorem.

Theorem 4.6. Consider the Pﬀaﬁan system (15a), (15b). The following assertions hold:

(1) Suppose the system has a formal solution ˆy. If ∂f1
∂y

(0, 0, 0) and ∂f2

and xp

(3) If the system is completely integrable and ∂f2

(0, 0, 0) is invertible then the system has a

unique formal solution ˆy. Moreover ˆy is 1-summable in xp′

1 xq′
2 .

Proof. To prove (1) note that if we consider equation (15a) as a singularly perturbed ordinary
diﬀerential equation and ∂f1
(0, 0, 0) is invertible then by Theorem 4.3 it has a unique formal
∂y
solution ˆy1, 1−summable in xp
1xq
unique formal solution ˆy2, 1−summable in xp′
conclude from Theorem 3.8 that ˆy converges.

2 . Since we are assuming that ˆy = ˆy1 = ˆy2 we

(0, 0, 0) is invertible then (15b) has a

2. In the same way, if ∂f2

1 xq′

∂y

The proofs of (2) and (3) are analogous so we only prove (2). If ∂f1
∂y

has a unique solution ˆy, 1-summable in xp
ˆw = xp′
check that ˆw is a solution of the linear diﬀerential equation with formal coeﬃcients:

(0, 0, 0) is invertible then (15a)
2. To see that ˆy is also a solution of (15b) we consider
− f2(x1, x2, ˆy). Then using the integrability condition it is straightforward to

Remark 4.7. If the conjecture stated in Remark 4.5 is true, the hypothesis of items (2) and (3)
of Theorem 4.6 cannot be satisﬁed if (p, q) 6= (p′, q′).

On the other side the following trivial example exhibits a simple situation of a non-completely

integrable system where the hypotheses of the previous theorem hold.

Example 4.1. Consider a constant vector c ∈ Cl, arbitrary p, q, p′, q′ ∈ N>0 and the Pfaﬃan
system

It has a unique formal solution given by ˆy = c and it is convergent. Also the system is not

completely integrable except by the case p = p′ = q = q′.
