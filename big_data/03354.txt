Hard gap in a normal layer coupled to a superconductor

The ability to induce a sizable gap in the excitation spectrum of a normal layer placed in contact
with a conventional superconductor has become increasingly important in recent years in the context
of engineering a topological superconductor. The quasiclassical theory of the proximity eﬀect shows
that Andreev reﬂection at the superconductor/normal interface induces a nonzero pairing amplitude
in the metal but does not endow it with a gap. Conversely, when the normal layer is atomically thin,
the tunneling of Cooper pairs induces an excitation gap that can be as large as the bulk gap of the
superconductor. We study how these two seemingly diﬀerent views of the proximity eﬀect evolve
into one another as the thickness of the normal layer is changed. We show that a fully quantum-
mechanical treatment of the problem predicts that the induced gap is always ﬁnite but falls oﬀ with
the thickness of the normal layer, d. If d is less than a certain crossover scale, which is much larger
than the Fermi wavelength, the induced gap is comparable to the bulk gap. As a result, a sizable
excitation gap can be induced in normal layers that are much thicker than the Fermi wavelength.

Introduction. There are

two seemingly distinct
paradigms for understanding the superconducting prox-
imity eﬀect. In a more traditional approach based on the
quasiclassical theory [1, 2] (which we dub “mesoscopic”),
Andreev reﬂection gives rise to a nonzero pairing am-
plitude but does not induce a superconducting gap in
a clean normal layer [3] [see Fig. 1(a)]. This seems to
stand in stark contrast to the approach adopted in more
recent studies of the proximity eﬀect in materials that
are a single atom thick. In this approach (which we dub
“nanoscale”), the tunneling of Cooper pairs opens a gap
in the excitation spectrum of the layer, and this gap can
be as large as the bulk gap of the superconductor (∆)
[4–8] [see Fig. 1(b)]. The latter approach has become
increasingly important in recent years, owing to the in-
tense push to realize Majorana fermions in condensed
matter systems [8–10]. As topological superconductivity
requires the presence of a sizable proximity-induced gap
to protect the zero-energy Majorana modes, this aspect
of the proximity eﬀect is crucial to the success of any
proposal to engineer the topological phase [11–18].

In this paper, we attempt to bridge the gap between
these two views of proximity-induced superconductivity
by studying the evolution of the induced superconducting
gap as the thickness of the normal layer (d) is changed
(see Fig. 2).
In order to treat both mesoscopic and
nanoscale systems, we formulate our approach in a fully
quantum-mechanical way. We ﬁrst show that the gap-
less state of the mesoscopic approach is an artifact of the
quasiclassical approximation. Within the same model as
in Ref. [3], we show that there are two competing en-
ergy scales, ∆ and 1/md2, that determine the size of the
proximity-induced gap (m is the eﬀective mass in the
normal layer, and we set  = 1). The quasiclassical ap-
proach misses the latter scale, and we show that a ﬁnite
gap is induced for any ﬁnite d. For a suﬃciently thin
junction with d (cid:46) dc, the induced gap constitutes a siz-
able fraction of the bulk superconducting gap. For an

where ξS is the superconducting coherence length and
λF is the Fermi wavelength. If the layer is metallic, then
we always have ξS (cid:29) λF , and it is possible to induce a
sizable gap in a normal layer that is many atomic layers
thick. If the layer is semiconducting but still ξS (cid:29) λF ,
a sizable gap can be induced in a layer that is not in the
2D limit. Finally, we address the eﬀects of Fermi sur-
face mismatch and an interfacial barrier, both of which
weaken the proximity eﬀect.

Before continuing with our analysis, we must address
some overlap between this work and the existing litera-
ture. First, we note that Ref. [19] obtained a gapped state
within the quasiclassical theory. However, this result is in
contradiction with that of Ref. [3], which predicts only a

indeed missed by the quasiclassical approximation. Sec-
ond, we note that Refs. [20–22] studied the proximity
eﬀect in a quasi-2D quantum well, where only the lowest
transverse subband is occupied and where the quantum
well and superconductor are only weakly coupled. Our
model allows us to treat both arbitrary thickness and ar-
bitrary coupling between normal layer and superconduc-
tor, and our results coincide with those of Refs. [20–22]
in the appropriate limits.

Model. We consider an SN junction as shown in
Fig. 2, where the normal layer has a ﬁnite thickness d.
We allow the mass m(x), the Fermi energy EF (x), and
the pairing potential ∆(x) to vary in a stepwise man-
ner across the SN interface. Speciﬁcally, we take m(x) =
mN θ(x)+mSθ(−x), EF (x) = EF N θ(x)+EF Sθ(−x), and
∆(x) = ∆θ(−x). We also allow for an interfacial barrier
of the form U (x) = U δ(x). Our model is described by
the standard BdG equation:

[H0 ˆτ3 + ∆(x)ˆτ1] ψ(k(cid:107), x) = Eψ(k(cid:107), x),

(cid:2)∂x/2m(x)(cid:3) + k2(cid:107)/2m(x) −

where k(cid:107) is the (conserved) momentum in the plane of
the SN interface, H0 = −∂x
EF (x) + U (x), and ˆτi are the Pauli matrices. Because
we are interested in studying the induced gap in the nor-
mal layer, which should not exceed the bulk gap of the
superconductor, we consider only energies E < ∆.

On the superconducting side, we must ensure that the
solution to Eq. (2) decays into the bulk. On the normal
side, we account for the outer boundary by requiring the
wave function to vanish at x = d. The wave function in
the two regions can then be expressed as

this paper, where a normal layer of ﬁnite thickness d is placed
in contact with a semi-inﬁnite superconductor (both materi-
als are inﬁnite in the yz-plane). A sharp potential barrier is
included at the SN interface, which is located at x = 0.

The boundary conditions form a set of four coupled equa-
tions that must be solved simultaneously. The condition
for the solvability of this system of equations determines
the excitation spectrum of the SN junction; i.e., a given
energy E belongs to the spectrum only if there exists a
choice of k(cid:107) for which the solvability condition is satis-
ﬁed. By determining which energies are absent from the
spectrum, we can determine the size of the gap that is
induced in the normal layer.

Breakdown of the quasiclassical approximation. As
ﬁrst shown in Ref. [3] [and as displayed in Fig. 1(a)],
the quasiclassical theory gives a normal layer density of
states that vanishes linearly at the Fermi energy. To re-
produce the quasiclassical results of Ref. [3], we neglect
the eﬀects of a sharp interface by setting U = 0 and by as-
suming that there is no Fermi surface mismatch between
the superconductor and normal layer. The quasiclassical
approximation corresponds to expanding the momenta of
Eq. (4) in the limit

which means grazing trajectories with k|| ≈ kF are ex-
cluded. This gives

where vF = kF /m is the Fermi velocity. Given the

validity of this solution to a narrow interval near the bulk
gap: ∆ − E (cid:28) ∆2md2 (cid:28) ∆. Thus, for both thin and
thick junctions, the quasiclassical approximation breaks
down below a certain energy. As will be shown in the rest
of the paper, the spectrum is gapped below this energy
scale.

Quantum-mechanical treatment. The starting point
for our fully quantum-mechanical treatment of the prox-
imity eﬀect is the exact solvability condition of Eq. (5),
which can be expressed as

with the dimensionless function f (k(cid:107)) given by [23]

In Eq. (12), we introduce the dimensionless barrier
strength w = 2U/vF N and the Fermi velocity mismatch
parameter s = vF S/vF N . We also deﬁne the dimension-
less momenta ¯p± = p±/kF S and ¯k± = k±/kF N . The
proximity-induced gap Eg is deﬁned as the minimum en-
ergy for which a solution to Eq. (S2) exists. While it
is straightforward to determine Eg numerically, we also
examine several diﬀerent limits analytically.

No mismatch, no barrier. We ﬁrst revisit the case
discussed previously in the context of the quasiclassical
approximation, when there is neither Fermi surface mis-
match (EF N = EF S, mN = mS) nor an interfacial bar-
rier (w = 0). To show that a gap is induced for any
value of d, we put E = 0 directly in Eq. (12). With f0 ≡
(kF d)2f , θ ≡ kF dϕ, and θ0 ≡

If no solution to f0(θ) = 0 exists (aside from the trivial
solution θ = 0, which corresponds to the wave function
being identically zero in the normal layer), then E = 0
is absent from the excitation spectrum and the system
is gapped. Since f0(θ) is an oscillatory function with
f0(0) = 0 and f(cid:48)
0(0) > 0, a solution to f0(θ) = 0 ex-
ists only if there is a local minimum of f0 that is neg-
ative. For a thin junction (θ0 (cid:28) 1), f0(θ) ≈ θ2 is a
monotonically increasing function, and the spectrum is
gapped. For a thick junction (θ0 (cid:29) 1), the function

trum is gapped for any choice of θ0. The magnitude of
the gap (Eg) is determined as the minimum energy at
which Eq. (S2) has a solution.
It is natural to assume that Eg (cid:28) 1/md2 for a thick
junction. In this limit, the form of k± in Eq. (7b) still
remains valid, while p± must be expanded in the limit op-

While Eq. (14) predicts that the gap is ﬁnite as long as

induced gap Eg as a function of thickness with strong
Fermi surface mismatch, plotted for various values of bar-
rier strength w. To enable a comparison with Fig. 4, we
keep EF N /∆ = 103 and s = 1; we also choose EF S/EF N =
mS/mN = 10.

Strong mismatch, no barrier. We now consider the
limit of strong Fermi surface mismatch. Having in mind
a quasi-2D semiconductor quantum well coupled to a su-
perconductor, we consider the case when kF N (cid:28) kF S
and EF N (cid:28) EF S.
Focusing on thin junctions where ∆mN d2 (cid:28) 1, we ﬁnd
that the induced gap is comparable to ∆ provided that
the Fermi velocity mismatch, which acts as an eﬀective
potential barrier at the interface, is suﬃciently weak [23],

∆mN d2 (cid:28) s(kF N d) (cid:28) 1/∆mN d2.

(17)
Accounting for the fact that s (cid:38) 1 in typical semiconduc-
tor/superconductor junctions, we ﬁnd that a large (∼ ∆)
proximity gap is induced provided that

d (cid:46) dc

(18)

where dc is given by Eq. (1) with λF replaced by λF N .

Strong mismatch, strong barrier Finally, we consider
the case when both strong Fermi surface mismatch and
a strong barrier (w (cid:29) 1/kF N d) are present. Similarly
to the case of no Fermi surface mismatch, the size of
the induced gap is again determined by the competition
between two large parameters [23]. When 1/∆mN d2 (cid:29)

normal layer; in the opposite limit, the induced gap is
small,

[24–26]; in the diﬀusive limit, Emg ∼ v2
F τ /d2 [25–29],
where τ is the scattering time. With even a small amount
of disorder, the minigap is likely to be larger than the
asymptotic limit given by Eq. (14).

For a thin junction, the forms of p± and k± given in
Eq. (7) remain valid. Expanding to leading order, we
obtain ∆f0(θ) ≈ Ωθ2. Since f0(θ) is a monotonically
increasing function in this limit, a solution to Eq. (S2)
exists only in the limit Ω → 0. Therefore, the full bulk
gap, Eg ≈ ∆, is induced in a thin junction.
The crossover between the two regimes occurs at d ∼

dc, with dc deﬁned in Eq. (1).

No mismatch, strong barrier. We now consider the
eﬀect of an interfacial barrier on the induced gap. Antic-
ipating that the barrier will decrease the gap, we focus
only on the limit of a thin normal layer (∆md2 (cid:28) 1). The
limit of a strong barrier can be treated analytically; the
“strong” barrier regime is deﬁned by w (cid:29) 1/kF d, so that
the w2 term in Eq. (12) gives the leading contribution to
f (k(cid:107)) for ϕ ∼ 1/kF d. In this regime, the gap is deter-
mined by the competition between two large parameters:
wkF d and 1/md2∆ [23]. In the limit wkF d (cid:28) 1/∆md2,
the full bulk gap of the superconductor is again induced
in the normal layer. In the opposite limit, only a small
fraction of the bulk gap is induced,

While it is still possible to induce a sizable gap in the

TABLE I. Crossover thickness of the normal layer in units
of dc deﬁned by Eq. (1). If d is less than the corresponding
thickness, an induced gap is comparable to the bulk gap in
the superconductor.

One interesting diﬀerence compared to the limit of
no mismatch is that the combination of length scales

(cid:2)dc(λF N /ξS)1/6(cid:3) does not change in the presence of a

barrier. As a result, the eﬀect of a moderate barrier is
actually weaker when there is strong mismatch; this can
be seen clearly in Fig. 5, which plots a numerical solution
of Eg(d) for various values of w in the strong mismatch
limit.

Conclusion. We have shown that a hard supercon-
ducting gap is proximity-induced in a normal layer of
any ﬁnite thickness and have studied the dependence of
this gap on the thickness of the normal layer. It is pos-
sible to induce a sizable fraction of the full bulk gap of
the superconductor in layers that are much thicker than
the Fermi wavelength, a result that is relatively robust to
moderate interfacial barrier strengths and strong Fermi
surface mismatch. The analytic results for the crossover
thickness, below which the induced gap is comparable to
the bulk gap of the superconductor, are summarized in
Table I.

The ability to induce a superconducting gap via the
proximity eﬀect has been well demonstrated experimen-
tally. Gaps observed in tunneling experiments on meso-
scopic junctions [30–32] can be attributed to the diﬀu-
sive nature of the normal layer and correspond to the
disorder-induced minigap. Conversely, in nanoscale junc-
tions involving either InAs or InSb nanowires, gaps ob-
served in transport experiments probing topological su-
perconductivity [33–36] can be attributed to the ﬁnite-
size eﬀects discussed in this paper.
In many materials
the observed gap appears “soft”; i.e., there remains a
ﬁnite density of states at the Fermi energy. However,
there have been recent observations of a hard supercon-
ducting gap [17, 18], an important step toward develop-
ing Majorana-based quantum devices. As a sizable gap
is needed to stabilize topological superconductivity, the
results of this paper signiﬁcantly lessen the experimen-
tal restrictions on the thickness of the proximity-coupled
layer in order to induce such a gap.

(S3)
Note that f (ϕN ) is a function of only a single variable parameterized by the in-plane momentum k(cid:107), as we can relate
S = 1 − (kF N /kF S)2(1 − ϕ2
ϕ2
N ). If at a given energy E there does not exist a value of ϕN that solves Eq. (S2), then
this energy is absent from the excitation spectrum of the normal layer and lies within the proximity-induced gap. The
magnitude of the gap Eg is deﬁned to be the minimum energy for which a solution to Eq. (S2) exists.

While the form given in Eq. (S3) is indeed very complicated, our plan of attack for determining the size of the gap
analytically is informed by the general behavior of f (ϕN ), which is displayed in Fig. S1. Two important properties of
f (ϕN ) are immediately apparent upon examining these plots. First, ϕ2
N = E/EF N always solves Eq. (S2); however,
this choice corresponds to k− = 0 and represents a trivial solution. We therefore search for solutions that satisfy
ϕ2
N > E/EF N . Second, it is clear that Eg can be identiﬁed as the energy at which the ﬁrst minimum in f (ϕN ) goes
to zero. Accordingly, our analytical strategy for determining the size of the gap will be to ﬁrst determine the value
ϕmin corresponding to this minimum before solving for the energy at which f (ϕmin) = 0.

No mismatch, no barrier

The ﬁrst case we will consider is that of no Fermi surface mismatch (mN = mS, EF N = EF S, ϕN = ϕS, s = 1) and
no interfacial barrier (w = 0). Given that the arguments of the oscillatory factors present in Eq. (S3) are of the form

(S4)
the function f (ϕ) oscillates on a scale ϕ ∼ 1/kF d when ϕ2 (cid:29) E/EF . Therefore, probing the ﬁrst minimum ϕmin ∼
1/kF d allows an expansion of Eq. (S4) in two diﬀerent limits: ∆md2 (cid:28) 1 (equivalently, k2
F d2 (cid:28) EF /∆) and ∆md2 (cid:29) 1
(equivalently, k2

F d2 (cid:29) EF /∆). We will now examine these two limits separately.

In the limit ∆md2 (cid:28) 1, we can expand Eq. (S3) for ϕ2 (cid:29) ∆/EF . Expanding Eq. (S3) to leading order, we ﬁnd

k±d = kF d

(cid:112)

ϕ2 ± E/EF ,

∆f (ϕ ∼ 1/kF d) = Ωϕ2.

Because this is a monotonically increasing function, the only way to satisfy Eq. (S2) is to have Ω = 0, or

Eg = ∆.

Therefore, the full bulk gap of the superconductor is induced in the normal layer.
We now consider the opposite limit, where ∆md2 (cid:29) 1. Anticipating that a small gap will be induced in the normal
layer, we consider energies that satisfy E (cid:28) 1/md2. This assumption allows us to expand for E/EF (cid:28) ϕ2 (cid:28) ∆/EF .
Expanding Eq. (S3), and replacing Ω → ∆, gives

(S7)

While the ﬁrst term in Eq. (S7) represents the leading term in the expansion, all given terms are comparable in
magnitude in the vicinity of ϕmin. The leading contribution to ϕmin is determined by the vanishing of the ﬁrst term
in Eq. (S7), ϕmin ≈ π/kF d. To calculate the ﬁrst-order correction to this value, we take ϕmin = π(1 − δϕ)/kF d, with
δϕ (cid:28) 1, and expand in the vicinity of ϕmin to obtain (any subleading terms are neglected here)

In this section, we calculate the gap in the presence of a strong barrier. Focusing on the limit ∆md2 (cid:28) 1, we

As we did previously, we keep all terms that are relevant for determining either ϕmin or f (ϕmin). In order for the
term proportional to w2 to form the leading contribution to f (ϕ), the barrier must be strong enough to satisfy
w (cid:29) 1/kF d. In this case, the leading contribution to ϕmin is again given by ϕmin ≈ π/kF d. To ﬁnd the ﬁrst-order
correction, we write ϕmin = π(1 − δϕ1)/kF d and expand for δϕ1 (cid:28) 1, giving

(ϕmin) = Ω(cid:2)(−2πw2kF d)δϕ1 + 2πw(cid:3).

Solving for the minimum gives δϕ1 = 1/w(kF d). However, when expanding Eq. (S12) in the vicinity of ϕmin to order
O(1/k2
F d2), we ﬁnd that all terms independent of E cancel. We therefore must go beyond ﬁrst order in determining
ϕmin. Writing ϕmin = π(1 − 1/wkF d + δϕ2)/kF d and expanding for δϕ2 (cid:28) 1/wkF d, we obtain

we write ϕmin = π(1 − 1/wkF d + 1/w2k2

The dominant E2 term in Eq. (S16) is determined by the strength of the barrier.

In the limit w2(kF d)2 (cid:29)
1/∆md2 (cid:29) 1, the second E2 term can be neglected compared to the ﬁrst. It is then very straightforward to solve for
the gap:

In the opposite limit, where 1/∆md2 (cid:29) w2(kF d)2 (cid:29) 1, the ﬁrst E2 term can be neglected and we have

If Ω ∼ ∆, then the ﬁrst term in Eq. (S18) is always much larger in magnitude than the second. The two terms

can express Eg = ∆ − δE and replace Ω = (2∆δE)1/2 in Eq. (S18). Solving f (ϕmin) = 0 for δE, we ﬁnd that the

In this section, we consider the limit of strong Fermi surface mismatch, so that kF N (cid:28) kF S and EF N (cid:28) EF S.
Because the in-plane momentum k(cid:107) has an upper limit of kF N , we can approximate ϕS = 1. In the limit ∆mN d2 (cid:28) 1,
S ≥ ϕ2

As long as ∆/EF S (cid:28) s(kF N d) (cid:28) EF S/∆, the third term in Eq. (S20) can be neglected compared to the ﬁrst two
terms. When s(kF N d) ∼ 1, the ﬁrst two terms in Eq. (S20) are comparable in magnitude and f (ϕN ) is a positive-
deﬁnite function; i.e., f (ϕN ) cannot be driven to zero at any ϕN by corrections to Eq. (S20). Therefore, the only
solution satisfying f (ϕN ) = 0 is Eg = ∆.
This argument breaks down, however, if the Fermi velocity mismatch is suﬃciently strong. Let us consider the case
where ∆/EF S (cid:28) s(kF N d) (cid:28) 1; in this limit, we can expand Eq. (S3) beyond what is given in Eq. (S20) to include
relevant corrections,

holds, then the only solution to f (ϕN ) = 0 must again be Eg = ∆.
If we instead consider the case where 1 (cid:28) s(kF N d) (cid:28) EF S/∆, expanding Eq. (S3) beyond what is given in Eq. (S20)
