ABSTRACT

We present a deep centimeter-wavelength catalog of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), based
on a 30 h single-pointing observation with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in its high-
resolution A-conﬁguration using two 1 GHz bands centered at 4.7 GHz and 7.3 GHz. A total of
556 compact sources were detected in a map with a nominal rms noise of 3 µJy bm−1, limited
by complex source structure and the primary beam response. Compared to previous catalogs,
our detections increase the sample of known compact radio sources in the ONC by more than a
factor of seven. The new data show complex emission on a wide range of spatial scales. Following
a preliminary correction for the wideband primary-beam response, we determine radio spectral
indices for 170 sources whose index uncertainties are less than ±0.5. We compare the radio to
the X-ray and near-infrared point-source populations, noting similarities and diﬀerences.

Introduction

The Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) has long been
a benchmark for centimeter wavelength studies
of young stars.
It is here that the ﬁrst com-
pact centimeter radio counterparts of young stars
were discovered using radio interferometry with
the National Radio Astronomy Observatory’s Very
Large Array (Moran et al. 1982, 1983), prior to
its recent upgrade to the Karl G. Jansky Very
Large Array (VLA). Subsequent studies uncovered
an entire ‘zoo’ of compact radio sources in the
ONC (Garay et al. 1987; Churchwell et al. 1987;
Felli et al. 1993b; Henney et al. 2001). Prior to
the VLA upgrade, centimeter radio studies of the
ONC culminated in the deep high-resolution con-
tinuum survey by Zapata et al. (2004). They de-
tected 77 radio sources in an image with an rms
noise level of 30 µJy bm−1 (1σ), many of them
variable. The ﬁrst observations using contin-
uum Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)
toward sources in this region were carried out
by Felli et al. (1989), targeting θ1 Ori A. Subse-
quently, Menten et al. (2007) obtained astromet-
ric continuum VLBI observations of four ONC
stars to obtain a parallax distance of d = 414±7 pc
(see also Kim et al. 2008). Kounkel et al. (2014)
used the upgraded VLA to obtain a wide-area cen-
sus of radio sources in the Orion region down to
an rms noise level of 60 µJy bm−1 (1σ). More re-
cently, we presented a new assessment of Q and Ka
band radio variability in the Orion BN/KL region
(Rivilla et al. 2015).

Regarding radio emission surveys of the ONC,
several
issues are important. Firstly, the en-
tire Orion Nebula is a very bright and extended
source of about 400 Jy at centimeter wavelengths.
Embedded within this nebula, the ONC contains
compact sources with ﬂux densities of less than
0.1 mJy, which corresponds to a dynamic range of
up to 106. It is here that interferometric imaging
with its spatial ﬁltering is an advantage, because
it reduces the imaging dynamic range requirement
(the entire radio ﬂux, of course, still causes ele-
vated system temperatures).

Secondly, there is a wide, continuous range
of source size scales, from very extended emis-
sion to very compact sources, and it can be un-

clear how to categorize sources. Thermal free-
free emission from ionized material is observed on
many scales (as is dust emission), while nonther-
mal emission from stellar coronal activity (e.g.,
Dulk 1985; G¨udel 2002) is very compact. Mildly
or highly relativistic electrons gyrate in magnetic
ﬁelds, emitting gyrosynchrotron or synchrotron
emission. Observational means of distinguishing
non-thermal from thermal emission involve, in ap-
proximate order of reliability, polarization (circu-
lar for gyrosynchrotron emission, linear for syn-
chrotron emission), spectral indices (Sν ∝ ν α with
spectra rising or ﬂat for thermal and falling for
non-thermal sources), and the rapid variability
usually associated with non-thermal sources. All
of these criteria require high signal to noise ratios
(SNRs), and thus for weak sources it may be im-
possible to determine the emission mechanism in
practice.

Thirdly, while centimeter radio emission is in-
sensitive to interstellar extinction, in contrast to
infrared and X-ray emission, plasma can easily
become optically thick, rendering sources behind
it unobservable.
Such foreground plasma may
not even emit radiation at the observed frequency
(e.g., G¨udel 2002), or its emission may be largely
ﬁltered out by an interferometer if occurring on
larger spatial scales. A radio non-detection thus
does not necessarily mean that a star is not emit-
ting at radio wavelengths at levels that would oth-
erwise be detectable.

Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) show both non-
thermal radio and X-ray emission. The two emis-
sion processes are thought to be due to coronal ac-
tivity in these sources (e.g., Feigelson & Montmerle
1999); they may also show thermal radio emission.
Based on deep observations of YSOs, most notably
in the Chandra Orion Ultra-deep Project (COUP),
the ONC has become one of the best-characterized
young clusters in X-rays (Getman et al. 2005b and
references therein). In 2013, we investigated the
relation between X-ray and radio emission in the
ONC, based on the most sensitive radio data prior
to the VLA upgrade and non-simultaneous X-ray
data (Forbrich & Wolk 2013). A review of simul-
taneous X-ray and radio observations of YSOs has
been published by Forbrich et al. (2011a,b).

We here present a deep radio census of point-
like sources in the ONC, using a single deep point-
ing of about 30 hours with the upgraded VLA,

Spectral index (MFS)

rived by MFS and in a manual 2-band calculation

densities in two bands. All points would lie on the

obtained in ﬁve epochs spanning six days. The
nominal sensitivity of the concatenated data is
3 µJy bm−1 (1σ) at the center of the primary
beam, elevated by contributions from complex
emission structure and the primary beam response
(see below). This is up to 10 times better than the
most sensitive previous study (Zapata et al. 2004).
Our observations were obtained with largely si-
multaneous X-ray coverage, using the Chandra X-
ray Observatory, the main driver being the study
of simultaneous X-ray and radio variability.

This paper discusses the nature of X-ray and
near-infrared counterparts to the radio sources.
In Section 2 we describe the VLA observations,
followed by a discussion of the data reduction in
Section 3. This includes the deﬁnition of the com-
pact source catalog and its interpretation in the
context of X-ray and near-infrared studies. Af-
ter discussing notable individual sources, we close
with a summary in Section 4.

In follow-up papers, we will address the fol-
lowing issues. Since the increase in radio con-
tinuum bandwidth means that the assumption
of monochromaticity has to be abandoned, new
imaging techniques are required (Bhatnagar et al.
2013), with implications for all of the above-

mentioned means of distinguishing thermal and
nonthermal emission. Note,
for example, that
in our experiment the size of the primary beam
changes by a factor of two over the sampled fre-
quency range. In a follow-up paper we will thus
assess the eﬀect of wideband imaging on polariza-
tion measurements and its implications for emis-
sion mechanisms. We will also discuss simultane-
ous radio and X-ray variability at high time res-
olution in more detail later. Finally, even though
the characterization of radio counterparts of YSOs
was the main motivation for this experiment, the
data also reveal exquisite details of extended emis-
sion, ranging from proplyds and Herbig-Haro ob-
jects to even more extended emission from the
Orion Nebula itself.

2. Observations

The observations were carried out with the Karl
G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) of the Na-
tional Radio Astronomy Observatory1 on 2012
September 30, October 2, 3, 4, and 5 under project
code SD630. The phase center was at (RA,Dec)
= 05h35m14.479s, −5◦22′30.57′′ (J2000); the du-
rations of these individual epochs were generally
7.5 h, except for epoch 3 with about 3 h, and
epoch 4, with about 5 h, resulting in a total of
about 30 h. During the ﬁrst two epochs, the ar-
ray was being re-conﬁgured to its high-resolution
A-conﬁguration from the BnA-conﬁguration. For
the other three epochs, the array was in its A-
conﬁguration. This conﬁguration was chosen to
maximize spatial ﬁltering and optimize the detec-
tion of point-like sources.

Data were taken using the VLA’s C-band (4-8
GHz) receivers in full polarization mode, with two
1 GHz basebands centered at 4.736 and 7.336 GHz
to provide a good baseline for source spectral index
determination. Each baseband was split into eight
subbands of 128 MHz each, which were in turn di-
vided into 64×2 MHz spectral channels. 3C 48
served as the primary ﬂux density calibrator and
J0541-0541 was observed in order to monitor the
complex gains. Generally, after ﬁve minutes on-
target (ONC), we switched to the gain calibrator,
ensuring very stable amplitude and phase calibra-

tion.

Apart from the ﬁrst epoch, the ﬁeld was si-
multaneously observed with the Chandra X-ray
Observatory. Mostly of interest for variability in-
formation, these data will be presented as part of
a follow-up paper. Generally, the COUP survey –
based on signiﬁcantly longer and thus more sensi-
tive observations – has resulted in the benchmark
X-ray catalog of this region.
In order to iden-
tify X-ray counterparts to radio sources, we thus
primarily use the COUP catalog (Getman et al.
2005b).
To identify infrared counterparts to
the radio sources, we make use of a new near-
infrared (JHKS) point-source catalog of Orion A
(Meingast et al. 2016).

3. Data reduction and analysis

The data were reduced using the VLA pipeline
2, which involves manual interaction for ‘ﬂagging’
(i.e., the identiﬁcation of faulty data not to be
used further), particularly of radio frequency in-
terference. The pipeline uses the Common Astron-
omy Software Applications (CASA) environment,
speciﬁcally the CASA 4.2.2 release. Imaging was
carried out within CASA and some parts of the
subsequent analysis were run in the Astronomical
Image Processing System (AIPS).

The ﬁve epochs were reduced separately. Ini-
tially, to better cope with the amount of data, we
conducted a series of tests as to how much time
and spectral averaging could be done with accept-
able losses across the wide-ﬁeld we imaged. We
decided to apply no additional temporal averaging
(beyond the 1-second correlator integrations), but
we averaged the 64 spectral channels down to 4
channels, leading to a loss in peak ﬂux density for
a source in the outer beam of < 6% by bandwidth
smearing (chromatic aberration). The test source
in this case was KM Ori (source 2) at a distance
of 4.′7 from the phase center where the wideband
primary beam attenuation amounts to a factor of
3.1 relative to the phase center. Due to the rapid
switching to the phase calibrator, phase-only self-
calibration on the data did not further improve
the quality of the phase calibration.

After calibration, all (u,v)-data were imaged
jointly using the ‘clean’ task in CASA. A multi-

frequency synthesis (MFS) approach, which mod-
els the frequency dependence of the source emis-
sion as a Taylor series during the deconvolution of
the point spread function (Rau & Cornwell 2011)
enabled maximum continuum sensitivity. A Tay-
lor series with nterms=2 in ’clean’ was used. The
output of this algorithm are coeﬃcients of the Tay-
lor expansion and their residual images following
the deconvolution, which can subsequently be used
to compute the total intensity image at the refer-
ence frequency (in this case, 6.1 GHz), and the
spectral index of the equivalent power law of the
emission. The errors for the spectral index map
are estimated by propagating appropriately the er-
ror terms derived from the residual images.

We generated a Stokes-I image of 8192×8192
pixels of 0.′′1, covering a ﬁeld of view of 13.′6 on a
side. This setup was mainly chosen to cover the
half-power beamwidth at the low-frequency end of
the bandwidth at 4.3 GHz (∼ 10.′5 HPBW), and
the image thus covers more than the half-power
beam for the high-frequency end of the bandwidth
at 7.8 GHz (∼ 5.′8 HPBW). Briggs weighting of the
(u, v) data with a ‘robust’ parameter of zero was
used, as an optimal balance between resolution
and sensitivity. Images with both the full (u, v)-
data and with additional spatial ﬁltering, with a
(u, v) range set to > 100 kλ, were produced. We
found that this low spatial-frequency cutoﬀ con-
stitutes a good compromise between point source
sensitivity and spatial ﬁltering. To assess the spec-
tral indices in the ﬁeld, we used the CASA task
‘widebandpbcor’ (in CASA 4.4) to obtain images
corrected to zero order for the wideband primary
beam response. With this task, a correction factor
was calculated for every spectral window. Using
‘nterms=2’, this task also produces a map of cor-
rected spectral indices.

In Figure 1, we show VLA images of the in-
nermost region of the cluster in the vicinity of
the Trapezium. The right panel shows the image
based on the entire (u, v)-data, while the left panel
shows the image created with the limited (u, v)
range, which ﬁlters structures larger than about
∼2′′. This is still larger than the synthesized beam
size of 0.′′30 × 0.′′19 (FWHM) at PA 30◦. A visual
inspection of these VLA images of the inner ONC
with optical images (e.g., from the Hubble Space
Telescope), we concur with Felli et al. (1993a) who
observed a good correspondence of radio struc-

7

tures with Hα emission on all scale sizes.

3.1. Assessment of spectral indices

Our assessment of the spectral indices is based
on the spectral index map produced by the tasks
‘clean’ and ‘widebandpbcor’. For resolved struc-
ture, such as for closely spaced sources, the MFS
approach is able to extract spectral index informa-
tion at the resolution of the MFS map, which is
usually sharper than just the low frequency map.
Also, complicated structure beneﬁts from using
all the data simultaneously during image recon-
struction to constrain both structure and spec-
trum at the same time. With the traditional sep-
arate approach, due to the non-uniqueness of de-
convolution results, one could end up with two
separate reconstructions that look ﬁne on their
own but which are inconsistent when the spectrum
is computed (for a more detailed discussion, see
Rau & Cornwell 2011).

For comparison, we have also imaged the two
1 GHz bands separately, to then obtain spectral
indices for unresolved and isolated sources that are
detected in both bands, after convolving the two
images to the same beam size (given by the low-
frequency band) and applying individual primary
beam corrections from ‘widebandpbcor’. We then
used the AIPS task JMFIT to obtain background-
subtracted ﬂux densities in both bands to calcu-
late the corresponding spectral indices. We com-
pared this to simply integrating the ﬂux densi-
ties in small boxes around each source position,
but this method fails when there are diﬀerent lev-
els of extended emission. Also, using JMFIT for
this comparison fails when a source cannot be de-
scribed by a Gaussian function, for example when
it is resolved with a complex shape.

As shown in Figure 2, we found good general
agreement between the two sets of spectral in-
dices for 157 sources where the spectral index er-
ror determined from the MFS images is ≤ 0.5
and JMFIT peak ﬂux densities could be deter-
mined. A few clear outliers highlight diﬃculties
with resolved sources in this simple test. Over-
all, when using the MFS spectral indices instead
of the traditional approach, a larger number of
spectral index measurements is available below a
given cutoﬀ in the nominal spectral index errors
(Rau & Cornwell 2011).

3.2. Point source detection

It is obvious from Figure 1 that, even with
the spatial ﬁltering aﬀorded by a (u, v) cutoﬀ at
> 100 kλ when imaging, bona-ﬁde point sources
that are seen in projection against extended struc-
ture will be distorted. Additional complications
can arise from imaging artifacts due to temporal
variability, eﬀectively limiting the sensitivity and
dynamic range in portions of the image. An exam-
ple for such artifacts can be seen in the vicinity of
θ1 Ori A, the westernmost Trapezium star in the
top right corner of Figure 1. Also, some appar-
ent point sources, most likely representing ionized
envelopes of young stars, can appear marginally
resolved. Since our primary objective here is the
detection of radio counterparts of stars, we focus
on the detection of pointlike compact sources.

Due to the spatial complexity of the data, we
found that no automated point-source detection
scheme resulted in a reliable list of detections. Up
to 50% of the sources meeting formal selection cri-
teria based on signal-to-noise turned out to be spu-
rious because of artifacts and sidelobes. With a
high degree of manual intervention required, we
decided to perform visual source detection ﬁrst,
carried out in several independent runs on all indi-
vidual epochs, and then in the concatenated data.
A combined total of almost 700 candidate sources
was identiﬁed and visually checked in the deep im-
age obtained from the concatenated (u, v)-data.
As preliminary indicators to assess these candi-
dates, we also considered the local SNR on scales
of ∼2′′ and ∼4′′ (9×9 and 19×19 pixels). Given
the spatial complexity of the radio emission, there
is, however, no generally useful cutoﬀ criterion
in the local SNR, but 98% of our sources have
a local SNR>3.
In a second step, we used the
AIPS task JMFIT to obtain a Gaussian ﬁt to each
source, which was then used to enforce a consis-
tent signal-to-noise cutoﬀ of SNR>5 in the con-
catenated data, where the task mainly uses the
global rms to calculate SNR. We report the peak
ﬂux density and its error, both corrected for the
primary beam response.

Our catalog of detections above SNR>5 con-
tains 556 sources and is listed in Table 1, their
locations are shown in Figure 3. The 556 sources
have median position errors, as estimated by JM-
FIT, of 6 mas in RA and 7 mas in Dec, with max-

imum errors of 0.′′1. These errors simply reﬂect
the S/N ratio, and since not all of our sources are
true point sources, this error reﬂects both the ﬁt
and potentially also source structure. We can esti-
mate the absolute astrometric accuracy of our ob-
servations by assessing the position of our source
8, which is bright and which has been identiﬁed
as likely extragalactic (Getman et al. 2005a). The
source is at a distance of 2.′45 from the phase cen-
ter, and it has a peak ﬂux density of 3.6 mJy bm−1.
Among the ﬁve individual epochs, the position
varies with a 1σ rms of 25 mas, consisting of
an rms of 24 mas in RA and 7 mas in Declina-
tion, which is reﬂecting the asymmetric synthe-
sized beam size and systematic errors. Based on
these considerations, we thus estimate an overall
absolute astrometric accuracy of 20 to 30 mas.

The presence of emission on many diﬀerent spa-
tial scales in the inner cluster means that it is dif-
ﬁcult to assess the completeness of our catalog.
The main challenge comes from the fact that the
nominal sensitivity is only reached in the outer
regions of the cluster, but not in the innermost
regions, due to the presence of artifacts and ex-
tended structure. As a consequence, we have a
consistent completeness limit in the outer regions
that are only aﬀected by the shape of the wideband
primary beam, but not in the innermost regions of
the cluster.

In order to attempt to quantify the variation
in catalog completeness due to complex emission
in the inner cluster, as well as the decrease in
sensitivity in the outer beam due to the primary
beam response, we have calculated annular aver-
ages of the noise in the residual maps that were
corrected for the primary beam response. In Fig-
ure 4, the resulting rms noise as a function of dis-
tance from the phase center is shown, both with
and without a correction for the primary beam
response. It becomes clear that the rms noise in
the inner cluster is roughly 2–3 times as high in
the area surrounding the phase center than fur-
ther out, reaching ∼ 12µJy bm−1. The lowest rms
noise of ∼ 5µJy bm−1 is then reached at about the
radius of the HPBW of the highest-frequency pri-
mary beam, and it then rises steadily with increas-
ing radius because of the correction for the wide-
band primary beam response. Nominally, how-
ever, without the primary beam correction, the
rms noise level should be as low as 3 µJy bm−1 in

8

the entire map. Note that the rms noise estimated
in Figure 4 does not necessarily correspond to the
rms noise reported by JMFIT for an individual
source.

3.3. Previously known sources

A diﬀerent way of assessing the completeness
is to compare the radio sample against previous
radio catalogs as well as against the X-ray and
near-infrared point source populations. To mini-
mize confusion of closely spaced sources, we have
opted for a consistent search radius of 0.′′5 in these
searches for known counterparts in catalogs with
well-matched spatial resolution. Only a few addi-
tional sources are found with larger search radii.
Our catalog of 556 point-like radio sources
constitutes the largest catalog of radio sources
in the inner ONC. Emission is detected from
all 77 positions reported in the VLA study by
Zapata et al. (2004), targeting the same area with
the pre-upgrade VLA. Additionally, most of the
sources reported in the wide-area JVLA survey of
Kounkel et al. (2014) were also detected in our
experiment. They reported 55 sources within
6′ of our phase center at a quoted sensitivity
of 60 µJy (1σ).
In this area, only four bright
sources reported by Kounkel et al. (2014) remain
undetected in our experiment, possibly indicating
some highly variable sources. The brightest source
is J053515.53–052248.3, listed by Kounkel et al.
(2014) with a peak ﬂux density at 4.5 GHz of
2.81 mJy. At this position, our local 5σ up-
per limit is 80 µJy at a reference frequency of
6.1 GHz, which indicates variability by a factor of
∼ 30. Similarly, for J053504.55–052013.9, listed
at 0.75 mJy by Kounkel et al. (2014), we ﬁnd
an upper limit of 25 µJy, and for J053521.66-
052526.5, listed at 1.34 mJy, our upper limit is
30 µJy. These cases indicate variability by a fac-
tor of at least ∼ 30 and ∼ 40, respectively, and
are the only ones among these four with X-ray
or infrared counterparts (within 0.′′5 of the pub-
lished position), the same criterion that we apply
to our data (see below; but note that the afore-
mentioned brightest source J053515.53–052248.3
has counterparts within 1.′′0). The fourth exam-
ple, J053517.32–052234.9, is less clear because it
is 1.′′1 (i.e., several synthesized beam sizes) away
from a bright proplyd corresponding to our source
347 which itself does not seem to appear in the

9

catalog of Kounkel et al. (2014).

Two most obvious complementary datasets
at other wavebands come from X-ray and near-
infrared surveys. Here, we use the X-ray catalog
of the Chandra Orion Ultra-deep Project (COUP),
as reported by Getman et al. (2005b), as well as
the near-infrared data (JHKS) from a new VISTA
survey of Orion A, called VISION, reported by
Meingast et al. (2016). All of these datasets are
expected to trace ONC members very well, miss-
ing only the most deeply embedded sources.
In
the near-infrared, additional complications include
confusion due to the bright extended nebula, a
problem that does not occur in the X-ray obser-
vations, and the presence of unrelated foreground
stars.

All but four of our compact radio sources lie
within a distance of 5.′2 of the phase center, span-
ning an area that corresponds approximately to
the largest half-power primary beam in our VLA
observations.
In the same area, where we ﬁnd
552 compact radio sources, the COUP catalog
lists 1067 X-ray sources, and VISION 1354 near-
infrared sources.

3.4. Source distribution

To study the radio source distribution in more
detail, and to compare it with the distribution of
X-ray and near-infrared sources, we plot the cumu-
lative radial source counts in these three bands, as
well as the distributions of sources with detections
in all three of these bands in Figure 5. Interest-
ingly, the three distributions rise almost in unison
with increasing distance from the phase center, up
to a radius of about 1.′6. At this point, the ra-
dio source distribution starts to level oﬀ, at least
partly due to the decreasing sensitivity caused by
radially increasing attenuation due to the primary
beam response. The X-ray and infrared distribu-
tions continue to rise, with the X-ray distribution
slowly leveling oﬀ at a radial distance of ∼ 2′. This
leveling oﬀ is partly attributable to a drop in sen-
sitivity away form the center of the ﬁeld of view,
and it partly seems to reﬂect actual structure of
the cluster.

Quite surprisingly, however, the almost identi-
cal rise in the three distributions does not mean
that the three source populations are identical. A
plot of the inner cluster, with the three diﬀerent

source populations indicated, is shown in Figure 6.
While there clearly are similarities, there are also
signiﬁcant diﬀerences. The region within the ra-
dius of 1.′6 contains 329 radio, 330 X-ray, and 334
near-infrared sources. Only about half of the ra-
dio sources have X-ray or infrared counterparts,
both of these about equally likely. Most of the ra-
dio sources with a counterpart in one of these two
bands have counterparts in both bands.

To better visualize these distinctions, we show
a Venn diagram of the radio, X-ray, and near-
infrared source populations in the inner r=1.′6
in Figure 7. Clearly, there are distinct popula-
tions in all three wavebands. It may be no sur-
prise to ﬁnd that there are radio sources with-
out counterparts at other wavelengths, because
of the method of source detection. We include
all compact-looking sources, certainly including
cases of thermal emission in shocks with no embed-
ded sources that would generate infrared or X-ray
emission. Sources with detections in at least two
bands are most likely cluster members, particu-
larly in this innermost area of the cluster, but a
few of the weaker ones could be extragalactic back-
ground sources. X-ray and near-infrared sources
are more likely to have multi-wavelength counter-
parts in the other bands than radio sources, possi-
bly because they are more likely to be associated
with young stars.
In particular, the probability
of an X-ray source having a near-infrared counter-
part and vice versa is very high, at ∼ 75%.

After assessing the radial properties of the
source distributions, we now study these in more
detail in two dimensions. Figure 8 shows the re-
sults of a Gaussian kernel density estimation, run
on all three samples with the same bandwidth of
15′′ to set the smoothing size scale. The similarity
of the spatial source distributions at X-ray and
near-infrared wavelengths are evident, while the
radio source distribution is noticeably diﬀerent.
In the radio, the BN/KL complex to the North-
west of the Trapezium clearly stands out, but
is less obvious at X-ray and near-infrared wave-
lengths (see also Rivilla et al. 2013a; Kuhn et al.
2015). Overall, the radio source distribution is
more elongated in the North-South direction than
the other bands. Generally, however, even the
2D distributions are similar enough to such a de-
gree that the corresponding 1D proﬁles are almost
identical.
Interestingly, we did not detect many

sources toward another peak in the stellar den-
sity, OMC1-S. This dense region in OMC harbors
very extincted COUP X-ray sources that power
several molecular outﬂows (Rivilla et al. 2013b).
These sources remain largely undetected in the
VISION near-infrared data, as might be expected
for deeply embedded sources, and they are also
barely detected in our radio data (see Figure 8).
Either these sources have intrinsically lower radio
emission, or their emission is absorbed by fore-
ground ionized material.

Since intracloud extinction will aﬀect the three
observing bands diﬀerently, it is of interest to con-
sider the three source populations and their loca-
tions with respect to the molecular cloud. As a
proxy, we show the contours of the submillimeter
dust emission, as observed with SCUBA at 850 µm
and reported by Di Francesco et al. (2008). The
area to the west of the cluster that is clearly de-
void of sources in all bands (see Figures 6 and 8)
is indeed in an area where more dust emission oc-
curs when compared to the area east of the cluster.
Since, however, centimeter wavelength sources are
barely aﬀected by extinction, contrary to near-
infrared and X-ray sources, this suggests that the
lower number count of radio sources is intrinsic to
the cluster.

3.5. Source properties

In a signiﬁcant change when compared to
quasi-monochromatic observations with the pre-
upgrade VLA, the primary beam correction for
wide-band data has become more complicated
(Bhatnagar et al. 2013). For our observation, the
observing frequency, and thus the size of the pri-
mary beam, changes by a factor of ∼2. To approx-
imately correct ﬂux densities for the decrease of
sensitivity with increasing distance from the phase
center, we have used the preliminary CASA task
‘widebandpbcor.’ As noted above, this task also
computes approximate spectral indices. Particu-
larly if there is an interest in sources with negative
spectral indices, like here, where we use this as a
criterion for nonthermal emission, the correction
for the wideband primary beam response is very
important. In uncorrected data, the smaller pri-
mary beam size at higher frequencies would bias
results toward negative spectral indices.

The radial distribution of peak ﬂux densities is
shown in Figure 9. A close-up view of the distri-

Fig.
7.— Venn diagram of the source popula-
tions within 1.′6 of the phase center, with area-
proportional overlap. This area contains 329 ra-
dio, 330 X-ray, and 334 near-infrared sources.
Note that this area does not contain the entire
radio compact source catalog but is largely un-
aﬀected by the sensitivity drop toward the outer
primary beam.

bution of the peak ﬂux densities in the inner clus-
ter is shown in Figure 10. The brightest source
detected is θ1 Ori A with a peak ﬂux density of
23.2 mJy bm−1 (source 254). Without a primary-
beam correction, this source is about 1800 times
brighter than the weakest source reported as part
of this list. The ﬁgure also shows that the bright-
est sources are clustered in the neighbourhood of
the Trapezium.

Among the sources presented in this sample,
170 have spectral indices with errors ≤ 0.5, and
these are marked in color in Figure 9. Given the
preliminary correction for the primary beam, we
restrict the discussion of spectral indices to these
sources. The errors in these wideband spectral
indices are calculated from the imaging residu-
als and are thus more realistic than errors based
on the overall image noise alone. The brightest
sources have positive spectral indices, while the
sources with negative spectral indices are signif-
icantly weaker. This is plausible in a scenario
where the sources with negative spectral indices
are nonthermal coronal sources and the bright
sources show thermal emission. Since the observed
nonthermal radio emission is tied to the surface
area of stellar coronae, the emitting volume is
much more restricted than in the case of thermal
emission from arbitrarily large amounts of ionized
material (e.g., G¨udel 2002). The distribution of
the spectral indices in Figure 11 shows that the
peak is close to zero, and with uncertainties of up
to 0.5, at this point we cannot disentangle signif-
icantly positive and negative spectral indices for
many of them.

For the inner area of the cluster, we show the
spatial distribution of the spectral index measure-
ments in Figure 12. We again only plot sources
where the uncertainty in spectral index is less than
0.5. There is a cluster of sources with positive
spectral indices, interpreted as thermal emission,
close to the Trapezium. This corresponds to the
main population of proplyds also shown in Fig-
ure 1. However, there are also several sources with
negative spectral indices in this inner area of the
cluster, and there is thus no clear correlation be-
tween spectral indices and clustering.

A set of radio spectral indices for Orion sources
was previously reported by Kounkel et al. (2014).
However, due to the lower sensitivity by more than
a factor of 10, their spectral indices have larger

errors with the ‘typical uncertainty’ of 0.6, above
our cutoﬀ. While there is considerable disagree-
ment in the reported spectral indices for individ-
ual sources, the numbers are mostly compatible
within twice the reported errors, and as such the
disagreements are not highly signiﬁcant. A more
detailed comparison would have to take into ac-
count diﬀerences in the calculation method of the
spectral indices and may indicate signiﬁcant vari-
ability in the spectral index for some sources.

3.6. Background sources

While we expect the source counts toward the
center of the ONC to be dominated by sources re-
lated to the cluster, the presence of many sources
with just a single-band detection in the inner
r = 1.′6 poses the question of contamination by ex-
tragalactic sources. We only have limited means to
assess membership with the data presented here,
but single-band detections are a priori candidate
extragalactic sources. A simple way to derive an
upper limit to any population that may be unre-
lated to the cluster is to extrapolate the source
counts in the outer beam to the inner area. Here,
we use the annulus deﬁned by the half-power beam
widths in the two bands, as depicted in Figure 3,
where we neglect the South-Eastern quarter since
it seems to contain a population of sources re-
lated to the ONC. Extrapolating the 21 sources
contained in the remaining three quarters of this
annulus and multiplying by the average primary
beam correction factor for this annulus yields an
estimate of 9 sources contained in an area with a
radius of 1.′6, i.e., the area depicted in the Venn
diagram in Figure 7. This estimate indicates that
97% of the compact radio sources, including the
single-band detections, are related to the clus-
ter. This conclusion is supported by the fact that
the single-band radio detections follow the same
North-South elongation also seen in the full radio
population and mentioned above.

Similarly, we note that Getman et al. (2005a)
have studied membership in the ONC based on
the COUP X-ray data. In the inner area covered
by the Venn diagram, they found only two can-
didate extragalactic sources among the full sam-
ple, indicating a contamination of the X-ray sam-
ple of only ∼ 1%. We would expect a similar
situation in the near-infrared given the excellent
near-infrared–X-ray correspondence, and indeed

Meingast et al. (2016) ﬁnd that the extinction lev-
els in the area discussed here correspond to a neg-
ligible background contamination.

In summary, all three bands yield valuable in-
formation on the cluster, with only limited con-
tamination from background sources. While X-ray
and near-infrared sources are very good tracers of
the stellar cluster populations, the radio sources
additionally trace features like jet shocks that are
related to the cluster but not with a one-to-one
correspondence with stellar sources. Overall, the
picture drawn for the inner cluster is the same,
regardless of which wavelength we choose, but at
the same time radio, X-ray, and near-infrared ob-
servations turn out to be highly complementary.

3.7. The radio–X-ray connection

The comparison of X-ray and radio emission
provides insight into the origin of the radio emis-
sion. If there is an underlying connection between
the X-ray emission and at least some of the ra-
dio emission (e.g., coronal activity that generates
nonthermal radio and thermal X-ray emission),
we would expect to see a correlation in the ra-
dio and X-ray luminosities. A total of 254 radio
sources from our catalog have X-ray counterparts
in the COUP survey. Compared to the entire set,
the subset of X-ray sources with radio counter-
parts has no peculiar X-ray spectral properties
(mainly, plasma temperature and foreground ab-
sorption). However, this subset generally selects
X-ray sources with high luminosities. In Figure 13,
we show histograms of the absorption-corrected
X-ray luminosities (where available from COUP)
of sources in the ﬁeld of view and, highlighted in
green, the subset of sources with radio counter-
parts. It becomes clear that all of the most lumi-
nous X-ray sources have radio counterparts, but
the detection fraction rapidly drops toward lower
X-ray luminosities.

This eﬀect has been discussed before (e.g.,
Forbrich & Wolk 2013; Rivilla et al. 2015), but
it can be better quantiﬁed with the new sample.
A plot of the corresponding detection fractions
is shown in Figure 14. This correlation suggests
that the fact that not all X-ray sources have ra-
dio counterparts is primarily a sensitivity eﬀect.
In our deep radio image, the detection rate drops
to about 50% for an absorption-corrected X-ray
luminosity of log(LX)=31 erg s−1.

Additionally, it is of particular interest to in-
vestigate the X-ray properties of candidate non-
thermal radio sources. We here focus on the 17
radio sources with clear negative spectral indices
(i.e. > 3σ), ranging from −0.21 ± 0.02 (source 27)
to −1.15 ± 0.38 (source 333).
Interestingly, not
all of these sources have X-ray counterparts: only
10 out of these 17 sources have counterparts in
the COUP survey. Out of 45 sources with clear
positive spectral indices (and presumably thermal
radio emission), 37 have X-ray counterparts.

This ﬁnally leads us to consider a direct cor-
relation of X-ray and radio luminosities, as ob-
served in the G¨udel-Benz (GB) relation for ac-
tive stars (G¨udel & Benz 1993; Benz & G¨udel
1994). For this purpose, we have converted the
primary-beam–corrected radio ﬂux densities to lu-
minosities, assuming a common distance of 414 pc
Menten et al. (2007). The resulting plot is dis-
played in Figure 15. This plot looks very similar to
the version prepared by Forbrich & Wolk (2013)
based on the archival VLA data of Zapata et al.
(2004) and COUP data. With 254 sources, how-
ever, this plot contains more than ﬁve times as
many points as the previous version. Nevertheless,
this plot still contains both thermal and nonther-
mal radio emitters, and the GB relation is only
expected to apply to nonthermal radio emission.
In terms of spectral types, this plot contains the
full range from M to O stars. Some of the sources
with the lowest X-ray and radio luminosities have
been identiﬁed as M stars (Getman et al. 2005b),
and both the most X-ray-luminous source as well
as the most radio-luminous source in this plot
are O stars. Other than that, there is no clear
correlation with spectral type.

Figure 15 shows that the X-ray and radio lumi-
nosities are not strongly correlated; there is a lot
of scatter. The nominal GB relation serves as an
approximate upper limit for the data. A priori,
the problem is still that for a more reliable analy-
sis, the nonthermal subset of the radio population
would have to be identiﬁed. As a ﬁrst step in this
direction, we plot the 114 sources with a known
X-ray luminosity where the radio spectral indices
could be determined to an error of 0.5 or better
(indicated in the color scale). The radio and X-ray
luminosities remain essentially uncorrelated, and
there is also no apparent correlation with spectral
indices. The sources with negative spectral indices

3.8. The radio–infrared connection

Another interesting aspect in the characteriza-
tion of the radio sources is the correspondence
with infrared sources. Near-infrared observations
provide a diﬀerent census of the cluster, ham-
pered only in some places by extinction and the
presence of bright nebulosity, where the eﬀective
sensitivity is signiﬁcantly reduced, as well as by
the presence of foreground stars. In total, across
the entire ﬁeld, 258 radio sources in our catalog
have near-infrared (JHKS) counterparts in the
VISION catalog (Meingast et al. 2016). As men-
tioned above, these 258 sources constitute a pop-
ulation that is diﬀerent from the 254 radio sources
that have X-ray counterparts: a combined total
of 214 radio sources have both X-ray and near-
infrared counterparts. A closer look at the prop-
erties of radio sources with near-infrared counter-
parts reveals that these sources have brighter near-
infrared emission than the full VISION sample in
the same ﬁeld of view. This means that the radio
detection fraction of infrared sources is at least
partly a sensitivity eﬀect. In Figure 16, we show
a histogram visualizing this eﬀect. The available
near-infrared color information from the VISION
catalog does not show that these colors are signiﬁ-
cantly diﬀerent when comparing the near-infrared
sources with and without radio counterparts.

3.9. Remarks on individual sources

Trapezium stars Like Kounkel et al. (2014),
we detect radio emission from three of the four
Trapezium stars, except θ1 Ori D. Like before,
signiﬁcantly variable radio emission is detected
in the vicinity of θ1 Ori A, even if this radio
source (GMR 12) is in fact a companion of θ1 Ori
A (Petr et al. 1998; Petr-Gotzens & Massi 2007).
Additionally, radio emission is detected toward
one of the two X-ray–emitting components of θ1
Ori B. Interestingly, Kounkel et al. (2014) report
a detection very close to the position of θ1 Ori C,
with a ﬂux density of 1.64±0.39 mJy (at 4.5 GHz),
while we only detect the source at a peak ﬂux den-
sity (full band) of 0.16 ± 0.03 mJy, possibly a sign
of signiﬁcant variability.

I as a very luminous radio source, powering the
Kleinmann-Low infrared nebula. As shown in Fig-
ure 17, in the immediate surroundings of sources
I and n several new faint sources were detected.
We detect source I as catalog number 185 with
a spectral index of 1.86±0.26, indicating thermal
emission. The position is 43 mas away from the
position reported by G´omez et al. (2008). Within
the errors, the derived proper motion in RA and
Dec is compatible with the values obtained by
G´omez et al. (2008). Note that source I is an ex-
ample of a source that is likely associated with
the cluster, yet does not have an X-ray or a near-
infrared counterpart, presumably due to high ex-
tinction.

Flare sources The spectacular ﬂare source
ORBS, reported by Forbrich et al. (2008), is de-
tected in our survey, but it does not show vari-
ability anywhere near the levels reported earlier.
This is only the second reported detection of this
source outside of a ﬂare. It is clearly part of an
apparent binary with two components that are 0.′′5
apart, with both components listed in our cata-
log (sources 198 and 201, see Figure 17). Source
198 is the counterpart of ORBS, and it is listed
with a peak ﬂux density of 43.6 ± 2.7 µJy bm−1.
It is thus brighter than the second component,
source 201, listed at 13.3 ± 2.7 µJy bm−1. We also
detect GMR A, one of the longest-known radio
sources in the ONC. A radio ﬂare toward GMR A
was reported by Bower et al. (2003). The vari-
able source OHC-E, reported for the ﬁrst time by
Rivilla et al. (2015) is detected in all epochs.

Proplyds To ﬁnd radio counterparts to known
proplyds, we compare our deep radio source list
with the catalog of Ricci et al. (2008). This cata-
log contains 197 circumstellar disks within 6.′7 of
the phase center in our data. Finding counterparts
of resolved sources is not entirely obvious from cat-
alog correlation, but we ﬁnd 124 matches with a
search radius of 1′′ and 130 matches with a search
radius of 5′′. About two thirds of the catalogued
proplyds thus have compact radio counterparts.
A more detailed look at some nondetections re-
veals that indeed no radio emission, not even from
extended structures, is detected. As shown in Fig-
ure 1, the radio emission of some of the proplyds

17

is resolved in these observations, revealing the full
proplyd geometry in great detail.

Brown dwarfs The fact that there is essentially
no population of faint near-infrared sources with
radio counterparts suggests in particular that the
number of radio-detected brown dwarfs is very
limited. In our deep radio observations, one could
have expected to detect radio emission of brown
dwarfs (e.g., Berger et al. 2001). However, we
have checked several catalogs of substellar ob-
jects (deﬁned here as >M6.5) in the ONC, and
we here report the detection of radio counterparts
for three such objects. We detect the M7.25 star
0990-3386, as reported by Ingraham et al. (2014).
It shows weak radio emission of (28±3) µJy bm−1
(source 24). This star is also a known weak X-
ray source. The ratio of the radio and X-ray
luminosities, using the absorption-corrected X-
ray luminosity from COUP thus is log(LR/LX)
= –13.2 Hz−1, which falls onto the relation re-
ported by Williams et al. (2014). We also re-
port the detection of a radio counterpart to
[HC2000] 114, an M7 dwarf (Slesnick et al. 2004).
This is source 535 in our catalog, with a ﬂux
density of (54±5) µJy bm−1, and here we ﬁnd
log(LR/LX) = –12.3 Hz−1. The X-ray detec-
tion of this brown dwarf was also discussed by
Preibisch et al. (2005). Finally, we report the de-
tection of a radio counterpart to [HC2000] 764, an
M7.5 dwarf. This infrared spectral classiﬁcation is
listed as less certain than ±1.5 spectral type sub-
classes, and the visible-light classiﬁcation is listed
as K8–M3 (Slesnick et al. 2004), so this may not
be a substellar object. It is the brightest radio de-
tection among the (candidate) brown dwarfs dis-
cussed here, at (155±3) µJy bm−1 (source 379),
and it does not have an X-ray counterpart.

4. Summary and conclusions

We present a deep centimeter radio census of
the Orion Nebula Cluster, based on a single 30 h
pointing with the upgraded VLA in its high-
resolution A-conﬁguration and largely simultane-
ously with Chandra X-ray observations. With the
increase in sensitivity, the VLA is tracing a vari-
ety of complex structures, and we here focus on
providing a catalog of 556 compact radio sources
in the innermost area of the ONC. The most ex-

tensive catalog of previously known sources, based
on VLA observations prior to the VLA upgrade,
listed 77 sources for the same area. We do not
detect four bright radio sources from a survey by
Kounkel et al. (2014), possibly indicating strong
variability for these sources.

In a ﬁrst step toward identifying radio emission
mechanisms, we report centimeter radio spectral
indices for 170 sources where the spectral index
uncertainty is ≤ 0.5. Both positive and negative
spectral indices are found for ONC sources, tracing
both thermal and nonthermal emission. Our spec-
tral indices generally diﬀer from those reported
by Kounkel et al. (2014), but at low signiﬁcance.
This may, however, be a signature of spectral in-
dex variability. Diﬀerences in the procedures used
to calculate spectral indices may also play a role,
and we compare our results based on MFS with
manually calculated spectral indices, ﬁnding good
general agreement for a subset of sources where a
comparison is possible.

When comparing this new radio compact source
catalog to the COUP deep X-ray census as well as
to a new near-infrared survey of Orion A we ﬁnd
that their cumulative radial distributions are al-
most identical, in absolute terms even, which could
be interpreted to mean that these three bands
seem to eﬀectively trace the cluster about equally
well in the innermost region of ∼ 1.′6. However,
while these distributions trace each other exceed-
ingly well, the radio, X-ray, and infrared source
populations are quite distinct, with only a limited
overlap. Yet, the spatial distributions of X-ray
and near-infrared sources appear very similar also
in 2D, but the radio source population is more
concentrated toward both the Trapezium and the
BN/KL region. Looking at individual sources,
there is a clearer correlation between X-ray and
near-infrared emission than between radio and ei-
ther X-ray or near-infrared emission. In summary,
while the radio sources appear to be overwhelm-
ingly related to the cluster, not all of them are
stellar but instead also include compact emission
from ionized material (e.g., from jet shocks).

A comparison of the radio catalog with the X-
ray and near-infrared catalogs shows that in spite
of the considerable increase in sensitivity, the ra-
dio observations are still sensitivity-limited when
compared to the other two bands. Among the X-
ray sources with radio counterparts and known

18

absorption-corrected X-ray luminosities, the ra-
dio detection fraction approaches 100% only for
the most X-ray–luminous objects, before falling
quickly toward lower luminosities, reaching 50%
at an absorption-corrected X-ray luminosity of
log(LX)=31 erg s−1. This completeness analysis
can be used to plan radio observations of other
young clusters of X-ray–emitting YSOs. Similar
to previous studies, preliminary results addition-
ally show that there is no clear correlation of X-
ray and radio luminosities, but a conclusive anal-
ysis will require carefully disentangling nonther-
mal and thermal emission ﬁrst. Also for the near-
infrared sources with radio counterparts, the ra-
dio detection fraction is highest for the brightest
near-infrared sources, again underlining the rela-
tive sensitivity limitations.

This radio source catalog provides a target list
for our ongoing study of correlated X-ray and ra-
dio variability at unprecedented time resolution
and sensitivity. Additionally, we are working on a
detailed study of thermal and nonthermal sources
in the area, involving more detailed wideband pri-
mary beam correction. Furthermore, we have ob-
tained astrometric follow-up observations with the
Very Long Baseline Array. Finally, this ONC ra-
dio dataset of unprecedented sensitivity also oﬀers
an excellent starting point not only for studies of
compact sources, but also for studies of extended
features like proplyds, bow shocks and ﬁlamentary
structures in the Orion Nebula, particularly when
it comes to astrometric studies.
