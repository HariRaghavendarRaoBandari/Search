HYPERGRAPHS WITH HIGH PROJECTIVE DIMENSION AND

1-DIMENSIONAL HYPERGRAPHS

K.-N. LIN AND P. MANTERO

ABSTRACT. We prove a sufﬁcient and a necessary condition for a square-free monomial ideal J
associated to a (dual) hypergraph to have projective dimension equal to the minimal number of gen-
erators of J minus 2. We also provide an effective explicit procedure to compute the projective
dimension of 1-dimensional hypergraphs H when each connected component contains at most one
cycle. An algorithm to compute the projective dimension is also included. Applications of these
results are given; they include, for instance, computing the projective dimension of monomial ideals
whose associated hypergraph has a spanning Ferrers graph.

1. INTRODUCTION

Let k be a ﬁeld, R = k[x1, · · · , xn] a polynomial ring with indeterminates x1, . . . , xn and let I
be a homogeneous ideal of R. Over the last decades there has been great interest in determining (or
bounding) two fundamental invariants of I, the projective dimension pd(R/I) and the Castelnuovo-
Mumford regularity reg(J). These two invariants play an important role in algebraic geometry,
commutative algebra and combinatorial algebra. To compute these two invariants, it is natural to
determine the minimal graded free resolution of I which, however, is often difﬁcult and computa-
tionally expensive to ﬁnd. A slightly different approach consists in ﬁnding upper bounds for these
two invariants for I, by computing the projective dimension and the regularity of one of its initial
ideals J = inτ (I). The projective dimension and the regularity of a monomial ideal are preserved
by polarization, thus it is sufﬁcient to consider square-free monomial ideals. In general, computing
the regularity reg(J) can be hard and computationally very expensive; for square-free monomo-
mial ideals, however, one can take advantage of the equality reg(J) = pd(R/J ∨), where J ∨ is the
Alexander dual of J, and reduce the problem to computing the projective dimension of a square-free
monomial ideal, which is then an active area of research.

In general, given a square-free monomial ideal J, several combinatorial structures can be as-
sociated to it (e.g. simplicial complexes, graphs, hypergraphs or dual hypergraphs). They have
been consistently used to establish combinatorial characterizations for the projective dimension
or regularity of J under additional assumptions, see – among the many papers on the subject –
[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7],[9],[14],[16],[18]. In the present paper, we employ the combinatorial struc-
tures of “dual hypergraphs” in the sense of [1] (which we call for simplicity hypergraphs) to de-
termine pd(R/J) for classes of monomial ideals J whose associated (dual) hypergraphs satisfy

certain combinatorial assumptions. We recall that the association of a dual hypergraph to a mono-
mial ideal J was ﬁrst introduced by Kimura, Terai and Yoshida, who employed it to compute the
arithmetical rank of certain square-free monomial ideals [11]. In the last few years, various work
has been done to determine invariants or detect properties of J using this combinatorial association,
see for example [8],[13],[10], [12],[15],[16].

One of the main results of this paper is motivated and, in some sense, is the continuation of work
of Kimura, Rinaldo and Terai, who found necessary and sufﬁcient combinatorial conditions on the
hypergraph of J to have pd(R/J) = µ(J)−1, i.e. projective dimension equal to its minimal number
of generators of J minus 1. In this paper we provide a sufﬁcient condition for pd(R/J) = µ(J)−2;
if, in addition, the hypergraph associated to J is a bipartite graph, then a necessary condition is also
given (Theorem 3.4). As an application, we compute the projective dimension of any J whose
1-dimensional subhypergraph has a spanning Ferrers graph (Corollary 3.10).

The second main result of this paper is the continuation of authors’ previous work [15], where
a combinatorial formula for pd(R/J) was found when the hypergraph associated to J is a string
or a cycle.
In the present paper, we ﬁnd the projective dimension of pd(R/J) when its (dual)
hypergraph is a disjoint union of trees or graphs containing at most one cycle (Theorem 4.7). In
the special case of a disjoint union of trees, also results of Morey and Villarreal, and Faridi apply
[18] [6] (because our tree hypergraphs are simplicial trees and then J is, in these cases, sequentially
Cohen-Macaulay); their results state that pd(R/J) equals the big height of J, i.e. the largest height
of an associated prime of J. In this scenario our combinatorial result provides an alternative way
to the above-mentioned algebraic formula for pd(R/J). When an explicit irredundant primary
decomposition of J is given, the big height of J is easily computed; on the other hand, when the
combinatorial structure is given, our formula usually provides a faster way to compute pd(R/J),
especially useful when J involves a large number of variables (because the big height is computed
as the maximum of all possible vertex covers of the corresponding simplicial structure).

The key idea for this result is to develop a process for breaking a “large” ideal into “smaller”
ideals having disjoint combinatorial structures, thus reducing the computational cost of ﬁnding
pd(R/J) (Propositions 4.4 and 4.6). Another consequence of Theorem 4.7 is a combinatorial for-
mula for pd(R/J) when the associated combinatorial structure can be described in terms of “small”
stars; in these cases the formula has a ﬂavor similar to the main result of [15] (Propositions 4.15 and
4.17).

The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we set the ground work for the paper, establish
notations, review properties and prove a few additional tools employed in the later sections. Section
3 is developed around the ﬁrst main theorem, featuring the necessary and the sufﬁcient condition
to have pd(R/J) = µ(J) − 2; it also contains an application to hypergraphs with a spanning
Ferrers graph.
In Section 4 we introduce an argument which essentially allows us to replace a
large 1-dimensional hypergraph with the disjoint union of smaller hypergraphs; we employ it to
prove Theorem 4.7 and provide a few applications. In Section 5 we have included an algorithm to

compute the projective dimension of the connected hypergraphs to which one can apply Theorem
4.7.

2. BACKGROUND AND A FEW LEMMAS

We recall that the deﬁnition of (dual) hypergraph on the vertex set V = [µ] = {1, 2, . . . , µ}, see

[1].

Deﬁnition 2.1. A (dual) hypergraph on V = [µ] is a subset H of the power set P(V ) such that
F = V . H is separated if, moreover, for every 1 ≤ j1 < j2 ≤ µ, there exist faces F1, F2 ∈ H

SF ∈H

with j1 ∈ F1 ∩ (V \ F2) and j2 ∈ F2 ∩ (V \ F1).

Let R = k[x1, ..., xn] be a polynomial ring over a ﬁeld k. If I is a square-free monomial ideal
in R, then one can associate a separated hypergraph H(I) to it: let m1, . . . , mµ be the minimal
monomial generating set for I, the hypergraph H(I) is deﬁned as

H(I) := {{j ∈ V : xi | mj} : i = 1, 2, · · · , n}.

The hypergraph H(I) deﬁned above is sometimes called the dual hypergraph of I and should
not be confused with the hypergraph constructed from I by setting as vertices the variables of the
polynomial ring, and having the faces correspond to the generators of the ideal. Also, following
[8],[10],[11],[15],[16] we assume all the hypergraphs are separated, unless otherwise stated.

Deﬁnition 2.2. Let I be a square-free monomial ideal with minimal monomial generating set
{m1, · · · , mµ}. We set pd(H) for pd(R/I), where H = H(I) is the hypergraph associated to
the square-free monomial ideal I, and call it the projective dimension of H.

Conversely, given a separated hypergraph H with vertex set V = [µ], one can associate to it
multiple monomial ideals, see for instance, [10] or [16]. In our proofs we will always associate
to H a (standard) square-free monomial I(H) minimally generated by monomials m1, ...mµ with
the additional property that for every face F in H, there is a unique variable xF such that xF |ml if
and only if l is in F . This can be done without loss of generality, since in [15, Proposition 2.2 and
Corollary 2.4], the authors showed that any two square-free monomial ideals associated to the same
separated hypergraph H have the same Betti numbers and projective dimension.

We now summarize a few combinatorial operations and their algebraic counterparts.

Deﬁnition 2.3. Let H be a hypergraph, I = I(H) ⊆ R be the (standard) square-free monomial
ideal associated to it, let F be a face in H and xF ∈ R be the variable associated to F ; also, let v
be a vertex in H and mv ∈ I be the monomial generator associated to it. We deﬁne the following
operations on H.

(i) The hypergraph Hv obtained by remotion of v from H is deﬁned as follows: let A be
the set obtained by removing mv from the set of minimal monomial generators of I, set
Iv = (m | m ∈ A) , then Hv = H(Iv); iterating this operation, one writes Hv1,...,vr for the
hypergraph obtained by removing multiple vertices v1, . . . , vr;

4

K.-N. LIN, AND P. MANTERO

(ii) the hypergraph Hv : v = Qv is the hyergraph H(Iv : mv) where Iv and Hv are as in (i).
(iii) the hypergraph H : F obtained by cancellation of F in H is the hypergraph associated to

I : xF ;

(iv) the hypergraph HF obtained from H by cutting F = {vi1, . . . , vir } is deﬁned as follows:
assume mij is the monomial in I = I(H) ⊆ R = k[y, xF ] corresponding to the vertex
vij ; now set R′ = k[y, xF1, . . . , xFr ] where xF1, . . . , xFr are new variables, and consider
the monomial ideal I F ⊆ R′ obtained from I = I(H) by changing only the monomial
mij . The hypergraph HF is H(I F ).
generators mij as follows: replace mij by m′
ij

Example 2.4. In Figure 1 we ﬁx the hypergraph H, a vertex v, and faces F and E. The hypergraphs
Hv, Hv : v = Qv, H : F , and HE are represented in Figure 2.

Discussion 2.5. We now discuss and explain brieﬂy the operations deﬁned in Deﬁnition 2.3.

(i) the “remotion” of v corresponds, in the realm of simplicial complexes, to taking the sub-
simplicial complex obtained by removing the face associated to v. Here we call it remotion
because from the point of view of (dual) hypergraphs it corresponds to removing v from H
and contracting the faces containing v.

HYPERGRAPHS WITH HIGH PROJECTIVE DIMENSION AND 1-DIMENSIONAL HYPERGRAPHS

5

(ii) the operation of “cancelling” F corresponds, in the realm of simplicial complexes, to the
operation of contraction of the vertex associated to xF . Here we call it cancelling because
from the point of view of (dual) hypergraphs it corresponds to cancelling F from H.

(iii) The operation of “cutting” derives its name from its combinatorial meaning, because HF
can be interpreted as the hypergraph obtained by cutting the face F into r parts (one for
each vertex of F ) and retracting each of them back to the corresponding vertex vij . This is
different from the cancellation of F as long as one the vertices vij is open in H, because
after this operation vij will become closed.

We now relate pd(H) with the projective dimension of the hypergraphs deﬁned in Deﬁnition 2.3.

Lemma 2.6. [15, Lemma 2.6] Let H be a hypergraph. If {v} ∈ H, then

pd(H) = max{pd(Hv), pd(Qv) + 1}.

Lemma 2.7. [15, Lemma 2.11] Let H be a hypergraph. If {v} ∈ H and all its neighbors are closed
vertices, then pd(H) = pd(Hv) + 1.

Lemma 2.8. [15, Lemma 2.8] If H′ ⊆ H are hypergraphs with µ(H′) = µ(H), then pd(H′) ≤
pd(H).

Proposition 2.9. [15, Proposition 2.10] Let H′, H be hypergraphs with H = H′ ∪ F where F =
{i1, . . . , ir}. If {ij} ∈ H′ for all j, then pd(H′) = pd(H : F ) = pd(H).

We recall the following folklore fact that can be proved, for instance, by means of Taylor’s

resolution [19].

Remark 2.10. Let H be a hypergraph then pd(Hv) ≤ pd(H) ≤ pd(Hv) + 1.

In the following, we will need to know how can the projective dimension of a hypergraph vary if

we make an open vertex become closed. This is studied in the following results.

Lemma 2.11. Let H be a hypergraph and let H0 be the hypergraph obtained by making one closed
vertex v in H become open. Then pd(H0) ≤ pd(H) ≤ pd(H0) + 1.

Proof. The inequality on the left follows by Lemma 2.8. Notice that H = H0 ∪ {v} and Hv = H0
v.
Then, by Remark 2.10, we have pd(H) ≤ pd(Hv) + 1 = pd(H0
v) + 1. The desired inequality now
follows because pd(H0

v) ≤ pd(H0), by Remark 2.10.

We note that the hypergraph H : F obtained by cancelling F can also be obtained by localization.

Lemma 2.12. Let F be a face of a hypergraph H, let I = I(H) ⊆ R, let p be the ideal of all

variables in R except xF , let eR = RxF , eI = IeR, S = grp
forms of eI in S.

If H1 = H(I1), then H : F = H1. In particular pd(H : F ) ≤ pd(H).

eR(eR), and let I1 be the ideal of initial

6

K.-N. LIN, AND P. MANTERO

Proof. Let R = k[y1, . . . , yn, xF ]. Since I is square-free, we can write I = xF J + K for some
square-free monomial ideals J, K of the form J = J ′T and K = K ′T with T = k[y1, . . . , yn]. In
particular, xF is regular on R/K. Then, it is easily checked that the ideal associated to H : F is

I : xF = (xF J + K) : xF = J + K.

With the same notation as above, we have eI = (J + K)eR, therefore I1 = (J + K)S, hence the

hypergraph associated to I1 is the same as the hypergraph associated to J + K.
In particular, we obtain pd(R/I) ≥ pd(Rp/Ip) = pd(S/I1) = pd(R/I : xF ).

Lemma 2.13. Let H be a hypergraph and F be a face of H then pd(H) ≤ pd(HF ).

Proof. Let H′ = HF ∪ F then pd(H′) = pd(HF ) by the deﬁnition of HF and Proposition 2.9.
The conclusion now follows by Lemma 2.8 since µ(H) = µ(H′), and H ⊆ H′.

Also, we obtain a possibly useful criterion to compute pd(H) when one more piece of informa-

tion is known.

Corollary 2.14. Let H be a hypergraph and let H0 be the hypergraph obtained by making one
closed vertex v become open. If pd(H0) 6= pd(Hv), then

pd(H) = max{pd(H0), pd(Hv)} = min{pd(H0), pd(Hv)} + 1.

Proof. If pd(H0) < pd(Hv), then by Remark 2.10 and Lemma 2.11 we have

pd(H0) + 1 ≤ pd(Hv) ≤ pd(H) ≤ pd(H0) + 1

which yields pd(H) = pd(Hv) = pd(H0) + 1. The case where pd(H0) > pd(Hv) is proved
symmetrically.

3. LARGE PROJECTIVE DIMENSION AND GENERALIZED FERRER GRAPHS

Let us recall that two vertices v 6= w in H are neighbors if there is a face of H containing
both of them. Let nb(v) denote the set of all neighbors of the vertex v, its cardinality deg(v) is
called the degree of v. If deg(v) = 0, i.e. v has no neighbors, then v is called isolated; in this
case one has pd(H) = pd(H′) + 1, where H′ = H \ {v}. Thus, each isolated vertex contributes
to the projective dimension with one unit. Since our focus is on the projective dimension of the
hypergraphs, and the projective dimension of a hypergraph with two disconnected subhypergraphs
is the sum of the projective dimensions of the subhypergraphs, we may assume all hypergraphs have
no isolated vertices.

Notation 3.1. Let H be a hypergraph with vertex set V (H), following [10] we write

• W (H) = {i ∈ V |{i} /∈ H} for the open vertex set of H,
• HU = {F ∈ H : F ⊆ U } for the restriction to a subset U ⊆ V (H) of the vertex set;
• Hi = {F ∈ H : dim F ≤ i} for the i-th dimensional subhypergraph of H.

HYPERGRAPHS WITH HIGH PROJECTIVE DIMENSION AND 1-DIMENSIONAL HYPERGRAPHS

7

Moreover, for a subset U ⊆ V (H) we deﬁne HU = H ∪ {{i} : i /∈ U } for the hypergraph obtained
by making all vertices of H not in U become closed.

It is well-known that if W (H) = ∅, then pd(H) = |V (H)|. The following theorem by Kimura,

Rinaldo and Terai characterizes when pd(H) = |V (H)| − 1.

Theorem 3.2. [10, Theorem 4.3] Let H be a hypergraph, then pd(H) = |V (H)| − 1 if and only if
H satisﬁes the following condition
(⋆) W (H) 6= ∅ and either the 1-dimensional part H1

W (H) of HW (H) contains a spanning complete

bipartite graph, or there is a vertex v such that {{v, w} ∈ H | for every w ∈ W (H)}.

One then has the following corollary.

Corollary 3.3. Let H be a hypergraph. Then pd(R/H) ≤ |V (H)| − 2 if and only if H satisﬁes the
following condition

(⋆⋆) W (H) 6= ∅, H1

W (H) does not contain a spanning complete bipartite graph, and

there is no vertex v such that {{v, w} ∈ H | for every w ∈ W (H)}.

Then, the next step is trying to determine the hypergraphs with pd(H) = |V (H)| − 2. We deﬁne

the following assumption:

(♯) H satisﬁes (⋆⋆) and there is a partition {V1, V2} of the vertex set V (H) such that both

HV1

and HV2

satisfy (⋆).

We now prove that (♯) gives, in general, a sufﬁcient condition for pd(H) = |V (H)| − 2. For
1-dimensional bipartite hypergraphs H we prove a necessary condition for pd(H) = |V (H)| − 2,
which is very similar to (♯).

Theorem 3.4. Let H be a hypergraph.
(i) If H satisﬁes (♯), then pd(H) = |V (H)| − 2.
(ii) If, furthermore, H is a 1-dimensional bipartite graph. Then pd(H) = V (H) − 2 implies there is
a partition {V1, V2} of the vertex set V (H) such that if G1 and G2 are obtained by cutting all edges
of H between V1 and V2, then both G1 and G2 satisfy (⋆).

Proof. (i) The inequality pd(H) ≤ |V (H)| − 2 follows by assumption (♯). To prove the other
inequality, we observe that, after cancelling all the faces containing vertices both from V1 and V2,
we are left with two disconnected subgraphs G1 = HV1 and G2 = HV2. Then, by Lemma 2.12 we
have

pd(H) ≥ pd(G1) + pd(G2)

We now show that, regardless of whether G1 and G2 are separated, one has pd(Gi) = |Vi| − 1 for
i = 1, 2. By symmetry, we only prove that pd(G1) = |V1| − 1. Since HV1
satisﬁes property (⋆)
is separated, then also G1 satisﬁes (⋆) and by
and all open vertices of HV1
Theorem 3.2 one has pd(G1) = |V1| − 1.

are in V1, if G1 ⊆ HV1

8

K.-N. LIN, AND P. MANTERO

We may then assume that G1 = HV1 is not separated. If H1

W (HV1 ) contains a spanning complete
bipartite graph where each bipartite set has more than one vertex, then G1 = HV1 is separated, which
has one vertex w connected to all of its open
contradicts our assumption. We may then assume HV1
vertices. Also, since G1 = HV1 is not separated, there are open vertices v1, ..., vt in V1 which are
vertices of faces containing vertices of both G1 and G2, and have the property that in H each vi has
only one neighbor in the vertex set V1. By the above, this neighbor is w for every i = 1, . . . , t, i.e.
they all have w as a common neighbor.

Then, when we cancel the faces connecting vertices of V1 with vertices of V2, the hypergraph
G1 just consists of |V1| − 1 closed vertices, because w degenerates after the cancellation and all its
neighbors, which include all open vertices of HV1, become closed. Then G1 is saturated and thus
pd(G1) = |V1| − 1, whence the conclusion follows.

(ii) Let W1 and W2 be the two vertex sets of the bipartite graph H. Since H satisﬁes (⋆⋆), then
by Corollary 3.3, there are two open vertices, v ∈ W1 and w ∈ W2, which are not neighbors.
Let V1 = {v, W2\w} and V2 = {w, W1\v}, then we have V1 ∪ V2 = V (H), and V1 ∩ V2 = ∅.
Since nb(w) ∩ V1 = ∅ and nb(v) ∩ V2 = ∅, then v and w are open after cutting all edges of
H between V1 and V2. Therefore pd(G1) ≤ |V1| − 1 and pd(G2) ≤ |V2| − 1. By Lemma 2.13,
pd(G1) + pd(G2) ≥ pd(H) = |V (H)| − 2 = |V1| + |V2| − 2. We conclude that pd(G1) = |V1| − 1
and pd(G2) = |V2| − 1, and both G1 and G2 satisﬁes (⋆) by Theorem 3.2.

Remark 3.5. It is easily seen that Theorem 3.4.(i) is also true (and has a much shorter proof) if
one replaces (♯) by the assumption that the restrictions H|V1 and H|V2 both satisfy (⋆) and are both
separated. However, the requirement that H|V1 and H|V2 are separated is somewhat restrictive and,
as we have proved above, unnecessary.

Also, the assumption that HV1

have property (⋆) is much weaker than requiring that
H|V1 and H|V2 are separated sub-hypergraphs of H satisfying (⋆) as can be seen in a number of
(even simple) examples. Consider, for instance, the 6-cycle graph

and HV2

H = {{1}, {1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {4}, {4, 5}, {5, 6}, {6, 1}}.

Then the vertex subsets V1 = {1, 2, 3} and V2 = {4, 5, 6} satisfy the assumptions of (♯), thus
pd(H) = |V (H)| − 2 = 4 by Theorem 3.4.(i); however, for every partition {U1, U2} of V (H)
neither H|U1 nor H|U2 is separated.

We suspect that the converse of Theorem 3.4 (i) holds true provided H is 1-dimensional bipar-
tite, although it does not follow by part (ii), because it is relatively easy to construct 1-dimensional
hypergraphs H where a partition of V (H) constructed as in (ii) does not satisfy the assumption (♯).
However, in all the examples considered by the authors, we could always ﬁnd another partition of
V (H) satisfying (♯). We then ask whether the following potential combinatorial characterization of
1-dimensional bipartite hypergraphs of projective dimension |V (H)| − 2 actually holds true:

HYPERGRAPHS WITH HIGH PROJECTIVE DIMENSION AND 1-DIMENSIONAL HYPERGRAPHS

Conjecture 3.6. Let H be a 1-dimensional bipartite hypergraph with pd(H) ≤ |V (H)| − 2; then
pd(H) = |V (H)| = 2 if and only if H satisﬁes (♯).

We have posed Conjecture 3.6 under the additional assumption that H is a bipartite graph for two
reasons: ﬁrst, for the converse of Theorem 3.4.(i) one needs additional assumptions, as we show in
Example 3.7; and, secondly, because Theorem 3.4.(ii) shows that for bipartite graphs a condition
very similar to (♯) is indeed necessary.

Example 3.7. The converse of Theorem 3.4.(i) does not hold in general, not even for graphs (i.e.
1-dimensional hypergraphs). For instance, let H be a 7-cycle graph whose vertices are all open.
Then by the main result of [15], the projective dimension of H is 5 = |V (H)| − 2. However, one
cannot ﬁnd a partition {V1, V2} of V (H) such that both HV1

satisfy (⋆).

and HV1

As an application of Theorem 3.4, we show that pd(H) = |V (H)| − 2 for a hypergraph H
W (H) has a spanning generalized Ferrers graph. First,

(not necessarily 1-dimensional) provided H1
however, we recall the deﬁnition of generalized Ferrers graph.

Deﬁnition 3.8. A 1-dimensional bipartite graph {v1, . . . , vs, w1, . . . , wλ1 }, is a generalized Ferrers
graph if, after a permutation of vertices, there are two sequences of integers λ = (λ1, . . . , λs) and
τ = (τ1, ..., τt) such that

• λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λs > 0,
• 0 = τ1 ≤ τ2 ≤ · · · ≤ τs < λs,
• λi ≤ τi for every i,
• and for every i, the vertex vi is connected to wτi+1, wτi+2, . . . , wλi (in particular, λi − τi is

the degree of vi).

We give an example illustrating this deﬁnition.

Example 3.9. Let H be a hypergraph with all open vertices whose 1-skeleton is described in Figure
3. Then, λ = (7, 7, 6, 5, 4), τ = (0, 0, 1, 1, 2).

If H1

W (H) has a spanning generalized

Proof. After possibly a vertex permutation we may assume τ1 = τ2 = · · · = τs = 0. Write
V (H) = {f1, . . . , fs, g1, ..., gλ1 , z1, . . . , zt} where {f1, .., fs} and {g1, ..., gλ1 } are the vertices cor-
responding to the two sets of generators of the bipartite graph spanning H1
W (H), and let {z1, . . . , zt}
are all the closed vertices of H. Take V1 = {{g1} ∪ {fi, | 2 ≤ i ≤ s}} ∪ {zk | 1 ≤ k ≤ t}, and
satisfy (⋆), thus the conclusion follows by
V2 = {{f1} ∪ {gj | 2 ≤ j ≤ λ1}}. Then HV1

and HV2

Example 3.11. G1 is the green subgraph and G2 is the red subgraph in Figures 4. Notice that
H1
W (H) only needs to have a spanning generalized Ferrers subgraph, so H could also contain higher
dimensional faces and closed vertices; however, they do not impact the difference |V (H)| − pd(H).
In fact, by Corollary 3.10, pd(H) = |V (H)| − 2.

4. PROJECTIVE DIMENSION OF 1-DIMENSIONAL HYPERGRAPHS

A vertex v in a 1-dimensional hypergraph H is called a joint if deg(v) ≥ 3. Let v be a vertex in a
hypergraph H, and let H1, . . . , Hr be the connected components of Hv; if one of them, say H1, is
a string hypergraph, we call H1 a branch of H (from v). This suggests the setting for the next result
where we prove that if a hypergraph has a branch, then we can remove a few extremal vertices and
keep track of the projective dimension.

Lemma 4.1. Let H be a hyerpgraph and B be a branch of H it with at least 2 vertices. Let v1 be
the endpoint of B, v2 its neighbor, v3 the neighbor of v2( if there is one). Then

(a) pd(H) = pd(Hv1) + 1 if v2 is closed;
(b) pd(H) = pd(Hv1,v2,v3) + 2 if v2 is open.

HYPERGRAPHS WITH HIGH PROJECTIVE DIMENSION AND 1-DIMENSIONAL HYPERGRAPHS

11

Assertion (b) generalizes [15, Proposition 2.15] to arbitrary hypergraphs.

Proof. Part (a) follows by Lemma 2.7. To prove (b) we apply Lemma 2.6 to v1. Since v2 is
open, we have Qv1 = Hv1,v2,v3 ∪ {w} where w is an isolated closed vertex (corresponding to the
edge connecting v2 and v3), hence pd(Qv1) + 1 = pd(Hv1,v2,v3) + 2. Now, Remark 2.10 yields
pd(Hv1) ≤ pd(Hv1,v2,v3) + 2, therefore, by Lemma 2.6, we have pd(H) = pd(Qv1) + 1 =
pd(Hv1,v2,v3) + 2.

To study branches of hypergraphs, we need to recall that an open string is a string hypergraph H
where every vertex is open except the two endpoints of H (which must be closed by separatedness).
Every string consists of open strings which are (possibly) separated by closed vertices; more details
on string hypergraphs and open strings can be found in [15].

Next, we deﬁne a more reﬁned invariants of a string, which also keep track of the orientation. In

fact, orientation appears to be crucial for branches inside general hypergraphs.

Deﬁnition 4.2. Let S be a string and let w = v1 and v = vn be its endpoints. Let n1, ..., ns be the
number of opens in each open string in S starting from w, thus ns is the number of opens in the
open string in S attached to v = vn.

(a) We say S is a 1-1 special conﬁguration if S does not contain two adjacent closed vertices and
n1 ≡ ns ≡ 1 mod 3 and ni ≡ 2 mod 3 for 1 < i < s. The modularity from v of a string S is the
number M (S; v) of pairwise disjoint 1-1 special conﬁgurations, counted starting from v.

(b) We say S is a 1-0 special conﬁguration from v if S does not contain two adjacent closed

vertices and ns ≡ 1 mod 3, n1 ≡ 0 mod 3 and ni ≡ 2 mod 3 for 1 < i < s.

(c) With O(S; v) we denote the number of 1-0 special conﬁgurations with respect to v which are

disjoint both 1-1 special conﬁgurations and other 1-0 special conﬁgurations from v.

(d) We let W (S; v) = |{i|ni ≡ 0 mod 3}| − O(S; v) be the number of open strings which have
3t open vertices for some t ∈ Z+ and are not part of a 1-0 special conﬁguration with respect to v.
(e) The quotient of the division of n − M (S; v) − W (S; v) by 3 is denoted by q(S; v); the

remainder of this division is denoted nr(S; v).

In the next results we show that the number nr(S; v) essentially detects the point on a string (or
branch) where we can cut the hypergraph without changing the projective dimension. In turn, this is
the key point to ﬁnd a simple way to compute the projective dimension of a number of 1-dimensional
hypergraphs (see Theorem 4.7).

Remark 4.3. The notions deﬁned in Deﬁnition 4.2.(b)-(e) are clearly sensitive to the choice of the
orientation. For instance, if v and w are the two endpoints of S, one may have W (S; v) 6= W (S; w).
For example, if S is a string of length 7 with vertices v1, . . . , v7 and v1, v5, v7 are the only closed
vertices of S, then W (S; v1) = 1 whereas W (S; v7) = 0.

If a 1-dimensional hypergraph H contains two adjacent closed vertices, then pd(H) = pd(H′)
where H′ is obtained by cancelling the edge connecting the two vertices (Proposition 2.9). Thus,

12

after replacing H by H′,without loss of generality, we may assume in all the following statements
that the 1-dimensional hypergraphs do not contain adjacent closed vertices.

We can now prove the main technical result of this section. It gives a precise formula allowing

us to detach all the strings from an arbitrary hypergraph.

Proposition 4.4. Let H be a hypergraph, w a joint, and let S be a branch of H from w = v0 having

vertices v1, ..., vn and containing no adjacent closed vertices. Let en = nr(S; vn) and q(S; vn) be

the numbers deﬁned in Deﬁnition 4.2.(e). Let E be the edge of S

(i) between the vertices ven+1 and ven+2, if v1 is open, the string of opens in S ending in w has
m ≡ 0 (mod 3) open vertices, and v1 is not part of 1-0 special conﬁguration with respect to
vn;

(ii) between the vertices ven and ven+1, in all other cases.
Then

pd(H) = pd(HE) = pd(eH) + pd(S ′)
where HE = eH ∪ S ′ is obtained by cutting the edge E of H. Moreover,

pd(S ′) = M (S; vn) + W (S; vn) + 2q(S; vn).

Remark 4.5. The proof of Proposition 4.4 has a subtle point, highlighted by the need to distinguish
case (i) from all other cases. The following example illustrates it. Set

H = {{6}, {6, 0}, {0, 5}, {5}, {0, 1}, {1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {4}}

The hypergraph H contains the branch S = {{0, 1}, {1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {4}}. One may use [17]
to verify that pd(H) = 5.

we obtain two disjoint hypergraphs: a string with three closed vertices and an open string with four

We have W (S; v4) = 1 anden = 4 − 1 − 3 = 0. If we cut the edge between the vertices v0 and v1,
vertices. Then pd(HE) = 3+3 = 6. On the other hand, we have pd(H) = 5 = pd(eH)+pd(S ′) =
3 + 2 where eH and S ′ are obtained by cutting the edge between vertices v1 and v2 as in assumption
Proof of Proposition 4.4. Let en = nr(S; vn) and eq = q(S; vn). We prove it by induction on the

number of open strings of S. We may assume n > 2. The inductive step is the same for both (i) and
(ii), thus we ﬁrst prove the inductive step and the base case later.

(i) of Proposition 4.4.

In the induction step, we may assume S has at least two open strings. Let Ss be the open string
in S, having vn as an endpoint; let us denote by vs1 the other endpoint of Ss and by qs the quotient
obtained when we divide the number ns of opens in Ss by 3. If ns = 3qs then qs iterations of
Lemma 4.1.(b) and one iteration of Lemma 4.1.(a) yield pd(H) = pd(H′) + 1 + 2qs, where H′
is the hypergraph obtained by removing from H the last 3qs + 1 vertices of S. We denote by S ′′
the string in H′ obtained after this procedure has removed Ss from S; also, let v1, . . . , vn′′ be the

vertices in S ′′ let q′′ = q(S ′′; vn′′) (note that n′′ = n − 3qs − 1 and q′′ = eq − qs) and fn′′ =

HYPERGRAPHS WITH HIGH PROJECTIVE DIMENSION AND 1-DIMENSIONAL HYPERGRAPHS

13

nr(S ′′; vn′′). Clearly S ′′ has one less open string than S; moreover, W (S ′′; vs1) = W (S; vn) − 1
and M (S ′′; vs1) = M (S; vn). Then, applying the induction hypothesis to H′ (and the string S ′′ in
it), we obtain

pd(H′) = pd(fH′) + pd(S ′′′)

and

pd(S ′′′) = M (S ′′; vs1) + W (S ′′; vs1) + 2q′′,

where fH′ and S ′′′ are the disjoint components of (H′)E ′. Notice that en = n − M (S; vn) −
W (S; vn) − 3eq = n′′ − M (S ′′; vs1) − W (S ′′; vs1) − 3q′′ = en′′. Since en = en′′, then E = E′
and eH = fH′. Since pd(H) = 2qs + 1 + pd(H′), we obtain
Therefore pd(H) = pd(eH) + M (S; vn) + W (S; vn) + 2eq. The case where Ss has ns = 3qs + 2

pd(H) = 2qs + 1 + pd(eH) + M (S ′′; vs1) + W (S ′′; vs1) + 2q′′

open vertices follows similarly, after qs + 1 applications of Lemma 4.1.

If ns = 3qs+1 we have three scenarios to consider: when Ss is part of a 1-1 special conﬁguration;
when Ss is part of a 1-0 special conﬁguration; when Ss is neither part of a 1-1 special conﬁguration
nor of a 1-0 special conﬁguration. In this latter case, S is a string with ni ≡ 2 mod 3 for i =

3(cid:5) = 2eq.

1, ..., s − 1, and ns ≡ 1, and 0 = W (S; vn) = M (S; vn). When v1 is closed, we haveen = 0, and
when v1 is part of the open vertex of the n1, we have en = 2. Repeated applications of Lemma 4.1
yield pd(S ′) = 2(cid:4) n

When Ss is part of a 1-1 special conﬁguration M ⊆ S, we remark that, by deﬁnition, M has
3l+2 vertices (for some integer l) and endpoints vn and, say, v′. Applying Lemma 4.1.(b) for l times,
and Lemma 4.1.(a) once, one obtains pd(H) = pd(H′) + 2l + 1. Then we can apply induction on
H′, and a proof similar to the above (with W (S ′; v′) = W (S; vn) and M (S ′; v′) = M (S; vn) − 1)
gives the conclusion.

When Ss is part of 1-0 special conﬁguration O, we observe that by deﬁnition the string O has
3l + 1 vertices (for some l), and endpoints vn and, say, v′. We can then apply Lemma 4.1.(b)
for l times to obtain pd(H) = pd(H′) + 2l. Then, the induction hypothesis applied to H′ and a
proof similar to the above (with W (S ′; v′) = W (S; vn) and M (S ′; v′) = M (S; vn)) yield the ﬁnal
statement.

Observe that the inductive step does not change the structure of the ﬁrst open string of S. We may
now prove the base case, where S is a string of opens. There are three cases to consider: n = 3q,
n = 3q + 1, and n = 3q + 2 for some integer q. In the ﬁrst case we apply Lemma 4.1.(b) q times

Assume n = 3q + 1. If v1 is open then we are under assumption (i), and W (S; vn) = 1 and

to obtain the conclusion. Notice that in this case, W (S; vn) = 0, M (S; vn) = 0, en = 0, and
eq = q(S; vn) = q.
en = 0. We apply Lemma 4.1.(b) q times and obtain
where eH is as in the assumptions, because we cut the edge between ven+1 and ven+2 when we apply
Lemma 4.1.(b) q times. On the other hand, if v1 is closed, then W (S; vn) = 0 anden = 1, because

pd(H) = pdeH + 2q,

14

K.-N. LIN, AND P. MANTERO

S has 3q − 1 open vertices and v1 and vn are closed. This time q applications of Lemma 4.1.(b)
give the conclusion.

We may then assume n = 3q + 2. If v1 is open, then W (S; vn) = 0 and en = 2. By applying

Lemma 4.1.(b) q times, we obtain

pd(H) = pdeH + 2q,

as before. Instead, when v1 is closed, then S has 3q open vertices and W (S; vn) = 1 and en = 1.

After applying Lemma 4.1.(b) q times, we apply Lemma 4.1.(a) once. We obtain

and we cut the edge between v1 and v2 when we apply Lemma 4.1.(a). This ﬁnishes the proof.

pd(H) = pdeH + 2q + 1,

the vertex connected to the joint w must be open. The next step consists in ﬁnding the projective

Notice that the branch eS of S in eH has at most two vertices. Moreover, if it has two vertices,
dimension of eH when each branch of the hypergraph has length at most 2. The following proposition

gives a reduction that detach the branches of the hypergraph in a controlled way.

Proposition 4.6. Let H be a 1-dimensional hypergraph, w a joint in H, S a branch departing from
w with n vertices and containing no adjacent closed vertices, and let E be the edge connecting w
to S. Then

pd(H) = pd(H′)

where H′ is the following hypergraph:

(a) if n = 1, then H′ = H : E, i.e. H′ is obtained by cancelling E;
(b) if n = 2, then H′ = Hw, i.e. H′ is obtained by removing w.

Proof. For assertion (a), let v1 be the vertex in S, we apply Lemma 2.6 to obtain

pd(H) = max{pd(Hv1 ), pd(Qv1 ) + 1}

Observe that Qv1 = (H : E) \{v1} = H′\{v1} and Hv1 = H′\{v1} ∪ {w} (if {w} ∈ H, i.e. if
w is already closed in H, then Hv1 = H′\{v1}). Then, by Lemma 2.11, pd(Hv1) ≤ pd(Qv1) + 1,
thus pd(H) = pd(Qv1 ) + 1 = pd(H′).

For part (b), let v1 and v2 be the two vertices of S and assume v1 is the neighbor of w. By Lemma

2.6 we have

pd(H) = max{pd(Hv2 ), pd(Qv2 ) + 1}

Notice that S becomes a branch of length 1 in Hv2 and then, by (a), pd(Hv2) = pd(Hv2 : E).
Since v1 is open (as remarked before Proposition 4.6), then Hv2 : E = H : E; on the other hand,
one has Qv2 = Hv2 : v2 = Hw\{v2}. Thus pd(Qv2) + 1 = pd(Hw) = pd(H′) and it sufﬁces
to show that pd(H : E) ≤ pd(H′). Finally, since the branch S in H′ is a string of length 2, then
pd((H : E)w) + 1 = pd(H′). Now, Remark 2.10 gives pd(H : E) ≤ pd((H : E)w) + 1, from
which the conclusion follows.

HYPERGRAPHS WITH HIGH PROJECTIVE DIMENSION AND 1-DIMENSIONAL HYPERGRAPHS

15

We can now prove the main result of this section, stating that we have a simple procedure to

compute the projective dimension of many 1-dimensional hypergraphs.

Theorem 4.7. Let H be a 1-dimensional hypergraph. If each of its connected components contains
at most one cycle, then by using the reduction process of Proposition 4.4 and 4.6, one can obtain
pd(H).

Proof. It is enough to prove the statement when H is a connected hypergraph having at most one
cycle. We may further assume that no closed vertices of H are adjacent, because otherwise we can
cancel the edge connecting them without changing the projective dimension – by Proposition 2.9.
Now, if H is a cycle, then the statement follows by [15, Theorem 3.4]. If H contains no cycles, then
iterated applications of Propositions 4.4 and 4.6 allow us to replace H by a disjoint union of strings.
If H strictly contains a cycle, then by assumption H is a cycle with one or more trees attached to its
vertices, and by repeated applications of Propositions 4.4 and 4.6 we may replace H by a disjoint
union of strings and, possibly, one cycle. In each of these scenarios, the main theorems in [15]
now allow us to compute the projective dimension of each component, and, therefore, the projective
dimension of the original hypergraph H.

In the Appendix we implemented explicitly two algorithmic procedures that can be employed to

compute pd(H) (in particular, see Algorithm 5.2).

Remark 4.8. (a) Theorem 4.7 may also be applied in certain cases where the connected compo-
nents of H contain more than one cycle, provided that all cycles except, possibly, one per connected
component, at the end of the reduction process of Proposition 4.6 become either strings, or are pair-
wise disjoint, or a combination of these two possibilities. This situation appears fairly frequently,

because if a joint has a branch S withen = 2 (in the statement of Proposition 4.4), then by Proposi-

tions 4.4 and 4.6.(b) we can remove the joint; the removal unfolds the cycle and makes it become a
string whenever the joint is one of the vertices of the cycle.
(b) Any 1-dimensional hypergraph is obtained by attaching together any number of trees and cy-
cles. Since Theorem 4.7 applies to all 1-dimensional hypergraphs H having an arbitrary number
of trees and at most one cycle and to some cases where H has multiple cycles cases (see (a)), then
Theorem 4.7 provides an effective method to determine the projective dimension of a wide class of
1-dimensional hypergraphs.

The next example illustrates Remark 4.8 in a concrete situation where H contains 3 different

cycles.

Example 4.9. The hypergraph H′ in Figure 6 is obtained by applying Propositions 4.4 and 4.6
repeatedly from the hypergraph H in Figure 5: we cut the blue faces, cancel the green faces and
remove the red vertices. Our procedure gives pd(H) = pd(H′) = 28.

We now deﬁne stars and use them to introduce a more complicated class of hypergraph, obtained
by connecting together stars via their centers. We will provide explicit combinatorial formulas for
their projective dimensions.

Deﬁnition 4.10. A connected hypergraph H is called a star if either |V (H)| = 1 (and we call the
only vertex of H its center) or H does not contain any cycle, no adjacent closed vertices, and it
contains precisely one joint (called the center of the star). H is called a d-star if H is a star and
every branch in H has length at most d.

An open star (closed star, resp.) is a star whose center is an open (closed, resp.) vertex.

Note that H is a 0-star if and only if |V (H)| = 1. Also, any (d − 1)-star is also a d-star when
d > 1; thus we say that H is a proper d-star if H is a d-star and H is not a (d − 1)-star (i.e. if
H contains at least one branch of length d). We now give a few more deﬁnitions, which can be
interpreted as natural generalizations of strings and cycle hypergraphs to stars. The only exception
is that for string hypergraphs the assumption of separatedness forces the endpoints of the string to
be closed vertices, whereas for strings of stars this need not be the case:

HYPERGRAPHS WITH HIGH PROJECTIVE DIMENSION AND 1-DIMENSIONAL HYPERGRAPHS

17

Deﬁnition 4.11. A string (cycle, tree, resp.) of stars is a hypergraph H consisting of a (ﬁnite)
collection of stars where each star is only connected to other stars via its center and the centers of
the stars form a string (cycle, tree, resp.).

Strings, cycles or trees of d-stars can also be thought as being obtained by taking a string (cycle,

tree, resp.) hypergraph and attaching to some (or all) of its vertices strings of length at most d.

Example 4.12. The hypergraph depicted in Figure 7 illustrates an example of a cycle of 2-stars.

First, we prove a simple formula for the projective dimension of open strings of “small” stars (i.e.

d-stars with d ≤ 2).

Proposition 4.13. If H is a disjoint union of trees and cycles of proper 2-stars, then pd(H) =
|V (H)| − T (H) where T (H) is the number of proper 2-stars in H.

Proof. By Proposition 2.9 we may assume there are no adjacent closed vertices. Also, by assump-
tion, every star has at least a branch of length two, thus we can apply Proposition 4.6.(b) to each star
and obtain

pd(H) = pd(H′)

where H′ is obtained from H by removing the center of each star. Since every star in H is a two
star, then any open vertex in H is adjacent to the center of a 2-star, thus it becomes closed after
removing the center. Therefore, all vertices in H′ are now closed, i.e. H′ is a saturated hypergraph
with |V (H)| − T (H) vertices. Therefore, pd(H) = |V (H)| − T (H).

In the study of string and cycle hypergraphs H, it was introduced a purely combinatorial invariant,
called modularity [15, Deﬁnition 3.1], employed in the formulas for pd(H). Here we naturally
generalize this concept to strings and cycles of stars.

Deﬁnition 4.14. We say that a string of stars H is a 1-1 special star conﬁguration if H does not
contain two adjacent closed stars and n1 ≡ ns ≡ 1 mod 3 and ni ≡ 2 mod 3 for 1 < i < s, where
ni is the number of open stars in the i-th open string of star in H. The star modularity M ∗(H)
of a string or cycle of stars of H is the maximal number of pairwise of disjoint 1-1 special star
conﬁgurations contained in H. Similarly, the star modularity of a disjoint union of strings or cycles
of stars is the sum of the star modularity of each connected component.

The following proposition has a similar ﬂavour as [15, Theorems 3.4, 4.3] and it provides an
effective combinatorial formula to compute the projective dimension of strings and cycles of 2-
stars.

Proposition 4.15. Let H be a string or cycle of 2-stars. Let T (H) be the number of proper 2-stars,
let H∗ be obtained from H by removing the centers of the proper 2-stars, and let s∗(H∗) be the
number of open strings of stars in H∗.

Proof. Applying Proposition 4.6.(b) to all proper 2-stars we obtain pd(H) = pd(H∗), and observe
that H∗ is the disjoint union of strings or cycles of 1-stars. Let H∗∗ be the hypergraph obtained
after applying Proposition 4.6.(a) to each proper 1-star. By deﬁnition of cancellation (Deﬁnition
2.3.(iii)), H∗∗ has the same modularity and number of open strings as H∗, and each open string
has the same number of vertices as H∗, because H∗∗ is obtained by cancelling the edges of the
branches of 1-stars. Then H∗∗ is a disjoint union of closed vertices and string or cycle hypergraphs,
with s∗(H∗) open strings and M ∗(H∗∗) = M ∗(H∗). Now the conclusion follows by applying [15,
Theorems 3.4, 4.3] to each connected component.

Example 4.16. Figure 7 below depicts a cycle of 2-stars H; Figure 8 shows the hypergraph H∗
as deﬁned in Proposition 4.15 (obtained by removing the red-labelled vertices). Then pd(H) =
37 − 4 − 3 + 1 = 31.

We now prove an analogous formula for the projective dimension of H when the 1-dimensional
part, H1, of H is a string or cycle of 1-stars. Notice that the hypergraph needs not be 1-dimensional

itself, it sufﬁces that its 1-skeleton satisﬁes certain properties and the higher dimensional faces are
“well behaved”.

Proposition 4.17. Let H be a hypergraph with V (H) = V (H1); assume its 1-skeleton H1 is a
separated string or cycle of 1-stars, and distinct stars do not share any higher dimensional face.

3 (cid:5);
(1) If the 1-skeleton of H is an open cycle of n1 1-stars, then pd(H) = |V (H)| − 1 −(cid:4) n1−2

(2) in all other cases pd(H) = |V (H)| − s∗ −Ps∗

of strings of open stars in H1, ni is the number of open stars in each string of open stars.

i=1(cid:4) ni−1

Proof. By Proposition 2.9, we may assume that there are no adjacent closed vertices. Moreover, by
deﬁnition, all 1-stars are open stars. We induct on the number of 1-stars and number of vertices. If
there is no 1-stars, then H1 is either a string or a cycle hypergraph; the assumption on the higher
dimensional faces implies that H = H1 (the distinct vertices of H are 0-stars); also, since H1 is
separated, the formula follows by [15, Theorem 3.4, 4.3].

We may then assume there is at least one proper 1-star; let w be its open center and v an endpoint
of one of its branches. Let F1, . . . , Ft be all higher dimensional faces containing v, we apply

Lemma 2.6 to v and observe that Hv = Qv ∪ {w} ∪ (Si{Fi|Hv }), because w is a joint and by the

assumption on the higher dimensional faces. Then all the other vertices of each Fi|Hv are closed in
Hv, hence by Proposition 2.9, we have pd(Hv) = pd(Qv ∪ {w}). Since w is open in Qv, then by
Lemma 2.11, we have pd(Hv) ≤ pd(Qv) + 1. This inequality combined with Lemma 2.6 yields
pd(H) = pd(Qv) + 1. Then by induction (and since Qv has |V (H)| − 1 vertices)

pd(H) = pd(Qv) + 1 = (|V (H)| − 1) − s∗ −

yielding the desired formula.

5. APPENDIX: ALGORITHMIC PROCEDURES AND MORE EXAMPLES

In order to apply Propositions 4.4 and 4.6 to compute the projective dimension of a hypergraph,
we ﬁrst need to algorithmically recognize if a vertex i in H is a joint or an endpoint, thus we need to
determine its degree d(i). Actually, for Algorithm 5.2 it sufﬁces to know if d(i) = 0, 1, 2 or if it is
greater than 2; so, for reasons of efﬁciency (e.g. if i has a large number of neighbors), in Algorithm
5.1 we only consider these possible outputs; of course, it can be easily modiﬁed to actually compute
d(i). The auxiliary variable j runs through the elements of the vertex set to identify neighbors of i.

Algorithm 5.1. Let H be a hypergraph, V (H) = {1, 2, · · · , µ}. The input is: i ∈ V (H), i.e. a
vertex in a hypergraph H. The output is: n = d(i), if this number is 0, 1, 2, or “n > 2” otherwise.

Step 0: Set n = 0, V = V (H) and j = 1.
Step 1: If n = 3, then stop and give “n > 2” as output.

If |V | = 1 then stop and give n as output;

20

K.-N. LIN, AND P. MANTERO

If j = µ, then stop and give n as output.
Otherwise, go to Step 2.

Step 2: If j = i, set j = j + 1 and go to Step 1.

If j 6= i then set V = V \{j} and do the following: if {i, j} ∈ H, then set n = n + 1 and
go to Step 1. If {i, j} /∈ H go to Step 1.

The following result provides an effective algorithmic way to compute the projective dimension
of each connected component in Theorem 4.7. In the following algorithm we use the variable i to
detect the vertices with degree one (if any); the variable j runs through the other vertices looking
for neighbors of i, and k looks for the other neighbor of j (if any). The variable v is used to count
|V (H)| (as the algorithm runs H changes and so does |V (H)|), and c is used to isolate the scenario
where H is a v-cycle.

Algorithm 5.2. Input: A connected 1-dimensional hypergraph H with at most one cycle. Let the
vertex set be V (H) = {1, 2, · · · , µ}. The output is: P = pd(H).

Step 0: Set P = 0, v = µ and i = 1.
Step 1: If H = ∅, stop the process and give P as output.

If H 6= ∅ set j = k = 1, c = 0 and do the following: if i ≤ µ, and go to Step 2, if i = µ + 1,
then set i = 1 and go to Step 2.

Step 2: If i /∈ V (H), then set i = i + 1 and start Step 2 again.

If i ∈ V (H), compute d(i) using Algorithm 5.1.

if d(i) = 0, set H = Hi, P = P + 1, v = v − 1 and i = i + 1, then go to Step 1;
if d(i) = 1 then go to Step 3;
if d(i) > 1 set c = c + 1 and do the following:

if c = v, then H is a v-cycle and we go to Step 7;
if c < v then do the following:

if i 6= µ, set i = i + 1 and start Step 2 again;
if d(i) > 1 and i = µ, set i = 1 and start Step 2 again.

Step 3: If j = i or if {i, j} /∈ H then set j = j + 1 and start again Step 3. If {i, j} ∈ H then go to

Step 4.

Step 4: Check if {j} ∈ H. If so, set H = Hi and P = P + 1, v = v − 1, i = i + 1 then go to Step

1. if If {j} /∈ H go to Step 5. (notice that since {j} /∈ H, then d(j) ≥ 2.)

Step 5: Use Algorithm 5.1 to compute d(j). If d(j) = 2, then go to Step 6; otherwise set H =

H\{{i, j}, {i}}, P = P + 1, v = v − 1, i = i + 1 and go to Step 1.

Step 6: If k = i, or if k = j, or if {j, k} /∈ H, then set k = k + 1 and start again Step 6. If
{j, k} ∈ H then set H = Hi,j,k, P = P + 2, v = v − 3, i = i + 1 and go to Step 1. (this
procedure stops because d(j) = 2)

Step 7: Use Algorithm 5.6 in [15] to compute pd(H) = Pc. Output P = P + Pc.

Remark 5.3. (1) The variable c counts the number of times that Step 2 runs consecutively without
ﬁnding a vertex with degree ≤ 1. If c = |V (H)|, then every vertex of H has degree ≥ 2, so H is a
cycle.
(2) Step 3 always starts with j = 1, and since d(i) = 1 then there is precisely one j with {i, j} ∈ H;
therefore Step 3 does not need a line for the case where j becomes larger than µ, because it stops
before then. A similar comment holds for the variable k in Step 6.
(3) In Step 4 of Algorithm 5.2, we set H = Hi because i has only one neighbor (so i is closed in
H), which is also closed. Thus, by Lemma 2.7, we can remove the vertex i and add one to P .

The following example illustrates the use of Algorithm 5.2.

Example 5.4. : In Figure 9 we provide a hypergraph H and all the steps of Algorithm 5.2 to
compute pd(H).
