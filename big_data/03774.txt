ABSTRACT
We present a comprehensive picture of the Cl 0218.3−0510 protocluster at z = 1.623 across
10 co-moving Mpc. Using ﬁlters that tightly bracket the Balmer and 4000 ˚A breaks of the
protocluster galaxies we obtain precise photometric redshifts resulting in a protocluster galaxy
sample that is 89 ± 5% complete and has a contamination of only 12 ± 5%. Both star forming
and quiescent protocluster galaxies are located allowing us to map the structure of the forming
cluster for the ﬁrst time. The protocluster contains 6 galaxy groups, the largest of which is the
nascent cluster. Only a small minority of the protocluster galaxies are in the nascent cluster
(11%) or in the other galaxy groups (22%), as most protocluster galaxies reside between the
groups. Unobscured star forming galaxies predominantly reside between the protocluster’s
groups, whereas red galaxies make up a large fraction of the groups’ galactic content, so
observing the protocluster through only one of these types of galaxies results in a biased view
of the protocluster’s structure. The structure of the protocluster reveals how much mass is
available for the future growth of the cluster and we use the Millennium Simulation, scaled
to a Planck cosmology, to predict that Cl 0218.3−0510 will evolve into a 2.7+3.9
−1.7 × 1014 M⊙
cluster by the present day.

Key words: galaxies: high-redshift

1 INTRODUCTION

Galaxy clusters are unique laboratories to study galaxy formation.
Distant clusters are the statistical ancestors of present-day clusters,
so we can study the processes that drive galaxy evolution by com-
paring the galaxies within clusters at low and high redshifts. Distant
clusters contain more blue, spiral galaxies with higher star forma-
tion rates than cluster members today (Poggianti et al. 2009b), as
well as a large fraction of post-starburst galaxies (Poggianti et al.
2009a; Muzzin et al. 2012) and a lack of low-mass red galaxies
(e.g., De Lucia et al. 2004; Rudnick et al. 2012), all of which im-
plies strong galaxy evolution.

The progenitors of present-day clusters are called ‘protoclus-
ters’. These are agglomerations of galaxies and groups that will
merge to form a cluster by the present day. These bound structures
are very extended, stretching up to 50 co-moving Mpc in diame-
ter (Muldrew, Hatch & Cooke 2015). Following the deﬁnition of
a cluster as a virialized structure, we therefore refer to the most
massive halo of the protocluster as the high-redshift cluster. These
nascent clusters are relatively compact objects, typically R500 ∼
0.5 Mpc or less (e.g. Fassbender et al. 2014), and contain only a
small fraction of the galaxies that will eventually form the present-
day cluster. Cosmological simulations reveal that the majority of

galaxies in clusters at z = 0 did not reside in the main halo at z > 1,
but rather in the extended protocluster (Muldrew, Hatch & Cooke
2015). It is therefore essential to study the protocluster, and not
simply the main halo, to trace the evolution of cluster galaxies to
the highest redshifts.

By tracing the evolution of all protocluster galaxies, we take
into account the variety of environments that a galaxy experiences
as the cluster collapses. Galaxies that end up in clusters start in
low density ﬁlaments and migrate to dense groups due to gravity.
Each environment imprints itself on the properties of the galaxies,
so the ﬁnal result is the sum of all the environments in which the
galaxy has ever lived. To trace the evolution of galaxies that end up
in the cluster core, we must identify all of their ancestors – those
that reside in dense environments at high redshift, and those that
migrate there at later times.

Tens of protoclusters and z > 1.5 clusters have been
spectroscopically conﬁrmed to date and hundreds of pro-
tocluster candidates are known (e.g. Wylezalek et al. 2013;
Planck Collaboration et al. 2015). The handful of z > 1.5 proto-
clusters that have been studied in detail reveal a strongly star-
forming galaxy population, and accelerated mass growth com-
pared to ﬁeld galaxies (Steidel et al. 2005; Hatch et al. 2011b;
Cooke et al. 2014), which supports a picture of accelerated galaxy
formation before the cluster has assembled. But in comparison
to lower-redshift clusters, our understanding of z > 1.5 clusters

and protoclusters is woefully poor. The intrinsic variety of galaxy
protoclusters means that full census has not been reached on
many issues. For example, it is not clear whether star forma-
tion is enhanced in protoclusters (Tran et al. 2010) or suppressed
(Quadri et al. 2012); whether galaxies are larger in size within pro-
toclusters or not (Papovich et al. 2012 versus Newman et al. 2014);
or whether the member galaxies are metal deﬁcient (Valentino et al.
2015), metal enriched (Shimakawa et al. 2015), or no different to
the ﬁeld (Kacprzak et al. 2015; Tran et al. 2015).

The primary challenge to studying protoclusters is obtaining
a sample of protocluster galaxies that is clean from ﬁeld galaxy
contaminants and yet complete enough that all types of protoclus-
ter galaxies are detected to sufﬁciently low masses. Clean samples
of protocluster galaxies are essential to isolate weak environmen-
tal trends and robustly compare properties of galaxies at different
redshifts. A complete sample is required to trace galaxies as they
evolve from star forming to quiescent objects.

The drive to ensure clean samples have led to the rise of
narrow-band imaging surveys that isolate protocluster Ha
emit-
ters (e.g. MAHALO; Hayashi et al. 2012) and near-infrared spec-
troscopic surveys (e.g. ZFIRE; Yuan et al. 2014). These surveys are
remarkably clean, but they miss galaxies without AGN and those
with low star formation rates. By contrast, photometric redshifts
are able to identify all types of protocluster galaxies, but redshifts
from broadband photometry are imprecise, with a typical accuracy
no better than D z/(1 + z) ∼ 0.03 at z > 1, so the contamination
by ﬁeld galaxies is high. For example, the broadband photometric
redshift catalogue of the XMM–LSS J02182-05102 protocluster at
z = 1.6233 by Papovich et al. (2012) has a 32% contamination rate
when compared with the spectroscopic survey of Tran et al. (2015).
In addition to the problem of identifying protocluster mem-
bers, is the challenge of interpreting observations of protoclus-
ters. To use protoclusters to study galaxy evolution we must place
them into evolutionary sequences of statistical ancestors and de-
scendants. But we currently lack the tools to convert observations
of protoclusters into meaningful parameters that characterise their
present evolutionary state and predict their future growth and z = 0
mass. We must therefore derive tools that enable us to accurately
estimate a protocluster’s z = 0 mass and rate of growth from an
observation at a single snapshot in time.

Recently progress

towards

(2013) who demonstrate

this has been made by
Chiang, Overzier & Gebhardt
there
is a strong correlation between the descendant z = 0 cluster mass
and the mass overdensity of a protocluster over large volumes
(15-25 comoving Mpc [cMpc] diameter). The uncertainty of
the descendant z = 0 cluster mass for each protocluster is very
large, due to both intrinsic scatter in the relation and the inherent
problems in converting the observed projected galaxy overdensity
into the true 3D mass overdensity (Shattow et al. 2013), but such
methods can be successful in estimating the statistically likely
mass of a large sample of protoclusters.

Here we present a study on the XMM–LSS J02182-05102 pro-
tocluster at z = 1.6233 (referred to as Cl 0218.3−0510 from now
on) that demonstrates how we can solve these issues and use proto-
clusters as laboratories to study galaxies evolve over cosmological
times.

The redshift of Cl 0218.3−0510 is known, so we use spe-
cial ﬁlters that span the Balmer and 4000 ˚A breaks to obtain high
precision photometric redshifts. Using this precision we select a
‘Goldilocks’ sample of protocluster galaxies: a sample that is both
clean enough and complete enough that we can robustly study
the properties of the protocluster galaxies and trace the wide-ﬁeld

structure of the protocluster. Using cosmological simulations to
identify protoclusters with the same wide-ﬁeld structure we demon-
strate that we can accurately determine its ultimate mass, and its
likely growth rate across time. As such we demonstrate that we
can place the protocluster in cosmological context, and with similar
data on (proto)clusters at other redshifts we can locate its statistical
progenitor protocluster and descendant cluster.

In this paper we present the method for selecting a clean and
complete sample of protocluster galaxies (Section 2). We estimate
the completeness and contamination of this method, map the struc-
ture of the protocluster and investigate how observing only one
type of galaxy can bias our view of the protocluster (Section 3).
Finally we explore what the structure of the protocluster can reveal
about its future growth (Section 4). In the accompanying paper we
present properties of the protocluster galaxies as a function of their
environment (Hatch et al. in prep). We use AB magnitudes through-
out and a L CDM ﬂat cosmology with W M = 0.315, W
L = 0.685
and H0 = 67.3 km s−1 Mpc−1 (Planck Collaboration XVI 2014).
In this cosmology, Cl 0218.3−0510 at z = 1.6233 has a scale of
8.71 kpc arcsec−1.

2 METHOD

2.1 Data

2.1.1 Broad-band Photometry

Cl 0218.3−0510 is covered by several deep optical and infrared
surveys: the near-infrared UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey (UDS; Al-
maini et al., in prep.), the optical Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Sur-
vey (SXDS; Furusawa 2008) and the Spitzer Ultra Deep Sur-
vey data (SpUDS; PID 40021, P.I. J. Dunlop). We use photom-
etry from these surveys compiled by Simpson et al. (2012) and
Hartley et al. (2013) (hereafter referred to as H13), who com-
bined U–band data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope with
BV Ri′z′ optical photometry from the SXDS, JHK photometry from
the eighth data release of the UDS, and SpUDS to create a K–
selected UBV Ri′z′JHK[3.6][4.5] catalogue (see Table 1 for details
of each image). Photometry was measured in 2 arcsec diameter
apertures because the protocluster galaxies are often very close to
one another. Aperture corrections were applied to the U, [3.6] and
[4.5] data to account for the large difference in the point spread
function (PSF) between these images and the rest of the optical and
infrared data.

Additional deep broad-band Y , J, and Ks images were ob-
tained as part of ESO programme 386.A-0514 (P.I. Tran) us-
ing HAWK-I (Kissler-Patig et al. 2008) on the ESO Very Large
Telescope (VLT). HAWK-I is a near-IR camera comprising four
Hawaii-2 2048 × 2048 pixel detectors separated by a gap of ∼
15 arcsec. The camera spans 7.5 × 7.5 arcmin with a pixel scale
of 0.106 arcsec pixel−1. The data were reduced using standard
near-infrared reduction techniques with the ESO MVM software
(Vandame 2004). Flux calibration was achieved using the UDS
and WFCAM to HAWK-I conversions derived for VIRCAM1,
which has almost identical ﬁlters to HAWK-I. The K−selected
catalogue of H13 was used for the basis of the astrometry, so
the resulting images are matched to the H13 catalogue to within

sure time, seeing and image depth.

2.1.2 Narrow-band images bracketing the Balmer and 4000 ˚A

breaks

The strongest spectral features for most of the protocluster galax-
ies are the Balmer (3686 ˚A) and 4000 ˚A breaks. The Balmer break
is strongest for galaxies which are still forming some stars, whilst
the 4000 ˚A break is most prominent in passively evolving galaxies
(see Fig. 1). High precision photometric redshifts can be achieved
if these features are well-sampled. We therefore obtained narrow-
band images of the protocluster at 9530 ˚A and 10600 ˚A using the
ESO/VLT FORS [SIII]+65 and HAWK-I 1.06µm (NB1.06) ﬁlters,
which cover rest-frame 3630 ˚A and 4040 ˚A, respectively, for galax-
ies in the protocluster at z ∼ 1.623. The Balmer break is tightly
bracketed by the FORS [SIII]+65 and Y ﬁlters, whilst the 4000 ˚A
break is sampled by the Y , NB1.06 and J ﬁlters (see Fig 1). The
images were reduced using the publicly available THELI software
(Erben et al. 2005; Schirmer 2013). Flux calibration was achieved
by linearly interpolating the photometry of the H13 catalogue, and
this catalogue was again used as the basis for the astrometric cali-
bration. See Table 1 for details regarding the exposure time, seeing
and image depth.

2.1.3 Photometric catalogue

The higher resolution HAWK-I Y, J, Ks images were convolved to
match the 0.81′′ PSF of the HAWK-I NB1.06 and FORS [SIII]+65
images. To do this we identiﬁed 12 bright, unsaturated and isolated
stars in the images and created growth curves in each of the bands
with apertures between 0.2′′ and 8′′. The HAWK-I Y, J, Ks images
were then convolved with a series of 16 Gaussians of s
ranging
from 1.5 to 3 pixels, and the growth curves remeasured in each
of these smoothed images. For each band the Gaussian-smoothed
image which resulted in the minimum-c 2 when compared to the
HAWK-I NB1.06 growth curves was identiﬁed as the best PSF-
matched image. We tested the PSF-matching algorithm by compar-
ing the growth curves of stars in the convolved images. We found
that the growth curves of the PSF-matched images for all bands are
within 1.5% for apertures of 2′′-diameter or larger.

c(cid:13) RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

Fluxes were then measured in the HAWK-I and FORS im-
ages within 2′′ diameter circular apertures on each position of the
K−selected catalogue of H13 using the IDL function APER. Uncer-
tainties were taken to be the square root of the photon counts in
the apertures plus the standard deviation of the total photon counts
within 2′′-diameter apertures placed in regions with no object de-
tections. Objects that fell within regions of the narrow-band images
for which the exposure time was less than 30% of maximum expo-
sure were removed from the catalogues to obtain data of approxi-
mately the same quality across the ﬁeld of view.

To concatenate the new photometry with the H13 catalogue
we ﬁrst applied aperture corrections to the new photometry to ac-
count for the different PSFs. Fluxes were measured in 2′′-diameter
apertures in the new J−band HAWK-I image (smoothed to a PSF
of 0.81′′) and compared to the J−band ﬂuxes from 2′′-diameter
apertures in the H13 catalogue. The J−band ﬁlters of the HAWK-I
and WFCAM instruments have very similar response curves (see
Fig. 1), so the ﬂux of an object in both images should be the same.
A linear ﬁt to the J−band ﬂuxes showed that the new photometry
was a factor of 1.06 times brighter than the J−band of the H13 cat-
alogue due to the sharper PSF, hence an aperture correction of 0.94
was applied to the new photometry before it was concatenated with
the H13 catalogue to form a complete photometric catalogue. All
photometry was corrected for Galactic extinction using the maps of
Schlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis (1998), and we rejected bright stars.
The ﬁnal catalogue consists of 3019 galaxies.

2.1.4 Spectroscopic redshifts

At the time the protocluster catalogue was created spectroscopic
redshifts had been obtained for 62 galaxies in the 50 arcmin2 area
that is covered by the above images. These redshifts were taken
from Papovich et al. (2010), Tanaka, Finoguenov & Ueda (2010),
and Santos et al. (2014). In addition to these published redshifts,
there exists a collection of unpublished redshifts from the UDSz
(Almaini et al. in prep) and others ( Simpson et al. 2012; Akiyama
et al. in prep and Smail et al. 2008), which are collated and avail-
able through the UDS website2. Sixteen of the 62 galaxies have

spectroscopic redshifts that indicate they are part of the protoclus-
ter.

After the protocluster galaxies were selected, two new cat-
alogues of this region were published. Tran et al. (2015) provide
spectra for 69 galaxies in the overlapping area, some of which had
previous spectroscopic redshifts. 3D-HST is a slit-less grism spec-
troscopic survey which covers a ninth of the protocluster region
that we imaged (Momcheva et al. 2015). We did not use these cat-
alogues to select the protocluster members, instead we use them to
estimate the completeness and contamination of the derived proto-
cluster sample in Section 3.1.

2.2 Identifying protocluster and ﬁeld galaxies

2.2.1 Photometric redshifts

Photometric redshift probability distribution functions, P(z), were
determined for each source by ﬁtting spectral energy distribu-
tion (SED) templates to the photometric data points using EAZY
(Brammer, van Dokkum & Coppi 2008). We applied the apparent
K-band magnitude prior that is distributed with the EAZY pack-
age. In addition to the six templates supplied with the EAZY pack-
age, we also add the seventh template created by H13 by applying
a small amount of Small Magellanic Cloud-like extinction to the
bluest template from the EAZY set. Given the broader PSF and the
effects of confusion the IRAC photometry is very uncertain, so pho-
tometric redshifts were determined both with and without the IRAC
data points, and no signiﬁcant difference was seen in the redshift
probability distribution functions.

Using the 62 spectroscopic redshifts as guides we made minor
adjustments to the photometric zeropoints to ensure we obtained
the most accurate photometric redshifts. We show a comparison of
zphot versus zspec for all 62 spectroscopically conﬁrmed galaxies in
Fig. 2. The biggest outlier at zspec = 1.75 is an X-ray source, hence
it is likely that AGN emission is responsible for the poor template
ﬁt.

The accuracy of the photometric redshifts at z ∼ 1.6 is twice
as good compared to galaxies at other redshifts. The dispersion
of zphot − zspec for the 16 galaxies in the protocluster is D z/(1 +
z) = 0.013, which is half that of the full sample. This is because
the FORS [SIII]+65, HAWK-I 1.06µm and Y −band images sam-

targeted survey of Tran et al. (2015). Photometric redshifts are the mean af-
ter prior redshifts (parameter z m2 outputted from the EAZY photometric
redshift ﬁtting code).

ple the Balmer and 4000 ˚A breaks at multiple points for galaxies
at the protocluster’s redshift (see Fig. 1). This precision is sim-
ilar to that achieved by the NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey
(NMBS; Whitaker et al. 2011) which augmented the optical and
near-infrared photometry on the COSMOS and AEGIS ﬁelds with
ﬁve medium band images that ranged across the wavelength range
typically spanned by Y , J and H. Here we show that a similar pre-
cision can be achieved for the galaxies in the protocluster with a
smaller number of images because the ﬁlters were optimally cho-
sen to span across the important Balmer and 4000 ˚A breaks.

2.2.2 Selecting potential protocluster galaxies

We use the full redshift probability distribution function to deter-
mine the likelihood of a particular galaxy being at the redshift
of the protocluster. We determine the probability, P, of an ob-
ject lying within a redshift range of z ± d z by integrating the red-
shift probability distribution functions, R P(z)dz, over the interval
zpc + d z to zpc − d z. We ﬁrst deﬁne two probabilities: (i) P2s
is
the probability of the galaxy lying within zpc ± 0.068 (i.e. within
the 95% conﬁdence interval on the photometric redshifts), and (ii)
P5s = zpc ±0.17. Then we use the spectroscopic redshifts to iden-
tify the best combination of these probabilities to select the poten-
tial protocluster members.

Selecting the best sample of protocluster galaxies depends on
the purpose of the sample. For example, a clean sample of proto-
cluster galaxies with few contaminants will likely miss many of the
protocluster galaxies, but a complete sample of protocluster galax-
ies will likely contain a large number of contaminants.

The compromise between a clean and complete protocluster
galaxy catalogue is the ‘Goldilocks’ sample, comprising of 143
galaxies that match the criterion P5s > 90% and P2s > 50%.
This Goldilocks sample was chosen to maximise the number of
spectroscopically conﬁrmed cluster members and minimise the
number of interlopers. Fifteen out of sixteen of the spectroscopi-
cally conﬁrmed cluster members are selected by this criterion, and
only two spectroscopic interlopers (at z = 1.536 and z = 1.703)
are included in the sample. We explore how the contamination and
completeness of the selected protocluster candidates vary as a func-
tion of P5s and P2s
in Section 3.1. Additionally, not all of the
Goldilocks sample will fall into the cluster by z = 0, so this sam-
ple contains some non-protocluster members. The identiﬁcation of
these outliers is explored in Section 4.5.

Selecting protocluster members by integrating P(z) means that
our galaxy sample will be biased against objects that have a broad
P(z). Due to the multiple sampling of the Balmer and 4000 ˚A breaks
the broadness of P(z) is approximately the same for both blue
and red galaxies of a given magnitude. However, the broadness of
P(z) is correlated with the signal to noise of the photometry. Since
passive galaxies have lower mass-to-light ratios than star forming
galaxies, this biases our protocluster galaxy selection against low-
mass passive galaxies because they are faint.

2.2.3 Selecting control ﬁeld galaxies

The protocluster extends across the entire ﬁeld of view covered by
the narrowband data, therefore we cannot select a sample of ﬁeld
galaxies at the same redshift as the protocluster using the sample
criteria as deﬁned above. Instead we deﬁne a ﬁeld sample which
contains galaxies at redshifts slightly below and above the proto-
cluster’s redshift.

The ﬁeld sample is selected following the same criterion as the
Goldilocks cluster sample, except that galaxies are selected around
the redshifts z f ield = 1.45 and 1.81, rather than centred on the clus-
ter redshift. These redshifts are chosen as they are as close to the
protocluster but avoid contamination by the protocluster galaxies
themselves. The narrow and Y bands lie nearby to the Balmer and
4000 ˚A breaks at these redshifts, and so help constrain the P(z) dis-
tribution, but the dispersion is approximately twice the dispersion
of galaxies at z = 1.62.

The effect of having a greater dispersion is that fewer control
ﬁeld galaxies are selected by the strict R P(z)dz criteria in com-
parison to the protocluster galaxies. Therefore the control ﬁeld is

likely to have a lower completeness than the protocluster ﬁeld. The
contamination level is likely to be similar as the interlopers in both
samples have a similar P(z) dispersion.

The ideal control sample is selected from the same volume as
the protocluster sample, and has similar levels of completeness and
contamination, i.e. 89% and 12%, respectively (see Section 3.1).
We use 9 spectroscopic redshifts in the redshift range of the con-
trol ﬁeld (1.4 < z < 1.5 and 1.76 < z < 1.86) to estimate the com-
pleteness and contamination. Control ﬁeld galaxies selected with
P5s > 90% and P2s > 50% have a completeness of 67 ± 27%
with no contamination. However, it is highly likely the contamina-
tion is at least the same as in the protocluster sample, but we do not
have sufﬁcient spectroscopic redshifts to measure this accurately.
Thus within uncertainties this criteria selects a control sample that
has similar levels of completeness and contamination as the proto-
cluster sample. It is therefore appropriate to use the same R P(z)dz
criteria to select the control sample.

To obtain a high completeness of 88% we must relax the selec-
tion criteria to P5s > 70% and P2s > 50%. The contamination
of this sample is 43%, which is far too high to robustly identify
group structure, and even some spectroscopically conﬁrmed proto-
cluster members are selected in the ‘control ﬁeld’ sample. For these
reasons it is not appropriate to select a control sample using such
relaxed parameters.

We therefore use the same R P(z)dz criteria, which select a
control sample with a similar level of contamination, and only
slightly lower completeness. Comparing the different completeness
rates we estimate that approximately 22% of the galaxies are miss-
ing in the control ﬁeld in comparison to the protocluster ﬁeld. This
missing fraction is highly speculative because we have so few spec-
tra in the control ﬁeld. However, we have examined each of our re-
sults in Sections 3 and 4 taking this into account and ﬁnd that none
of our conclusions are compromised if the completeness is reduced
by 22%.

The control ﬁeld sample contains 88 galaxies in total, 78 of
which lie at z ∼ 1.45 and 10 lie at z ∼ 1.81. The difference between
the number of galaxies at the lower and higher redshift intervals is
due to both cosmic variance, and cosmic dimming, which results in
a D m = 0.6 mag difference between galaxies at z ∼ 1.45 and 1.81.
This ﬁeld sample lies within a volume that is approximately twice
the size of the Goldilocks protocluster sample.

The control ﬁeld is selected from a comparatively small area
and thus is subject to cosmic variance. At z ∼ 1.45 and ∼ 1.81 the
control ﬁeld is 17% denser than the UDS as a whole. All of the
enhanced density is due to a larger density of galaxies at z ∼ 1.81
in the small ﬁeld of view. In the entire UDS there is an underdensity
of galaxies at z ∼ 1.8 (H13), so the larger density in the small ﬁeld
of view used in this work may be more typical of the Universe.

2.3 Galaxy properties

We derived stellar masses of the galaxies by ﬁtting the U to
4.5µm photometry with stellar population models using the spec-
tral energy distribution (SED) ﬁtting code FAST (Kriek et al. 2009).
The photometric catalogue was ﬁrst scaled by the K−band ra-
tio of ﬂux measured using the SEXTRACTOR BEST aperture
to that measured in a 2′′ aperture. The BEST ﬂux is taken as
the SEXTRACTOR AUTO ﬂux when no neighbour biases the
results by more than 10%, otherwise it is taken as the ISO-
COR ﬂux (Bertin & Arnouts 1996). To ﬁt the photometry we use
Bruzual & Charlot (2003) stellar population templates with solar
metallicity, exponentially declining star formation histories (SFR =

exp(−t/t )), the Kriek & Conroy (2013) average dust law (with
Eb = 1 and d = 0.1) and we assume stars are formed with the initial
mass function of Chabrier (2003). Throughout the ﬁtting process
the redshifts of the protocluster members were ﬁxed to z = 1.6233
whilst the redshifts of the ﬁeld galaxies were ﬁxed to the mean after
prior redshifts output from EAZY.

The observed star formation rates (SFRs) were measured from
rest-frame UV luminosities using the Kennicutt (1998) conver-
sion from 2800 ˚A (assuming a Chabrier IMF): SFR( M⊙yr−1) =
8.24 × 10−29L2800( erg s−1 Hz−1 ). To measure L2800 we use the
mean after prior redshifts (for ﬁeld galaxies) or ﬁxed z = 1.6233
(for cluster members) to determine the ﬁlter that has the closest
central wavelength to 2800 ˚A then add a k−correction based on lin-
ear interpolation taking into account the UV slope. In this work
we are only interested in the distribution of galaxies of a certain
observed SFR, so we make no correction for dust extinction.

2.4 Identifying substructure

2.4.1 Measuring local environment

Muldrew et al. (2012) showed that the best measures of internal
halo properties were nearest neighbour and Voronoi tessellation
methods. Although the protocluster studied here does not consist
of only one halo, the same principle applies as we wish to identify
groups within a large high-density region.

We calculated the local environment of each location in the
ﬁeld of view using several methods: projected Voronoi tessella-
tion; third, ﬁfth and eighth projected nearest neighbour; cumula-
tive distance from the ﬁrst to ﬁfth and tenth nearest neighbours. We
adapted the original deﬁnition of the cumulative distance to the nth
nearest neighbour (Cowan & Ivezi´c 2008) to be a measure of the
projected environment:

f nth =

1
r S n
i=0r2
i

,

(1)

where ri is the projected distance to neighbour i and r
is the total
number of galaxies divided by the total area of the ﬁeld-of-view.
All of these methods are affected by edge effects, which means
galaxies close to masked regions and the edge of the detector have
unreliable environment measurements. We found there were strong
correlations between all of these environmental measurements.

The best measure was the cumulative projected 5th neighbour
distance, f 5th, since this method improves the robustness of the
nearest neighbour measures by minimising distortions by interlop-
ers. Appendix B of Ivezi´c et al. (2005) describes in detail the im-
provement gained from using the distances to all n nearest neigh-
bours compared to only the distance to the nth neighbour. The
choice of 5th nearest neighbour was regulated by survey depth; n
was chosen to be the largest possible number that is small enough
so we can still identify structure on the scale of a few hundred kpc.

2.4.2 Maps of galaxy and stellar mass density

Maps of the projected galaxy density of the protocluster and control
ﬁeld were created by measuring f 5th for each 0.25′′ pixel of 7.5′ ×
7.5′ ﬁeld of view. Maps of the projected stellar mass density were
created by measuring the stellar mass density within 30′′ of each
0.25′′ pixel centre, and then smoothed with a boxcar average of
100 pixels (25′′) width. Stellar mass density maps were scaled to
display the stellar mass per Mpc2 (Figs.3, 5 and 6).

The galaxy formation models of Henriques et al. (2015) show

us that stellar mass is a good tracer of the underlying dark mat-
ter, so the stellar mass maps give the most accurate representation
of the distribution of dark matter in the protocluster. However, the
resolution of the maps we can create is poor (∼ 20′′ ∼ 0.17 Mpc)
and only very massive groups can be identiﬁed in these maps. The
ﬁlaments that surround the groups of a protocluster may be narrow
and will be missed in our stellar mass density maps. The galaxy
density maps are more useful for locating the lower mass groups
and to visualise the relatively low density ﬁlaments. In addition
to this complication, we must remember that the stellar mass of a
halo does not linearly correlate with dark matter mass. At z = 1.62,
models predict that the stellar mass of a central galaxy increases
approximately linearly with halo mass until the mass of the galaxy
reaches 1010.5 M⊙ (e.g Wang et al. 2013). Galaxies with higher
stellar masses have a higher total-to-stellar mass ratio. Thus a small
group of low mass galaxies may trace a lower dark matter halo mass
than a single massive galaxy of the same total stellar mass.

In Fig. 3 we show the projected galaxy and stellar mass den-
sity maps of the control ﬁeld to provide a comparison for the pro-
tocluster distribution shown in the following section. The control
ﬁeld comprises a region with twice the volume of the protocluster
(a redshift interval both in front and behind the protocluster), so we
have halved the projected stellar mass density to allow for a direct
comparison with the protocluster.

The control ﬁeld galaxy density map reveals two dense galaxy
groups (see Fig. 3 and Table 2). One of the groups lies very close
to the edge of the ﬁeld of view, which illustrates that using the f 5th
allows us to identify galaxy groups up to 13′′ from the edge of the
7.5′ ﬁeld of view. The projected stellar mass density map shows a
very different picture: the map is smooth which implies there is no
signiﬁcant structure in the projected dark matter distribution. The
dense groups in the ﬁeld therefore trace relatively low dark matter
mass halos, or are line of sight projections of galaxies masquerad-
ing as groups. The regions of highest stellar mass density are not
co-spatial with the location of the galaxy groups, but rather near
regions that host the most massive galaxies that are not obviously
in groups.

2.4.3 Deﬁning groups

Since the environmental parameter we deﬁne is a relative measure-
ment that depends on the redshift and survey depth, we use the con-
trol ﬁeld sample to deﬁne the value of f 5th that best deﬁnes which
galaxies belong to groups and which lie in between the groups. We
visually inspect the f 5th maps and deﬁne separate groups as regions
where the galaxy density peaks. Through trial-and-error we ﬁnd the
best divide of ﬁeld and group galaxies for the control ﬁeld sample
occurs at f 5th = 13. This boundary selects groups on the scale of
a few hundred kpc, which is the scale of small collapsed galaxy
groups expected at this redshift.

Approximately 90% of the ﬁeld galaxies have f 5th < 13. The
ten control ﬁeld galaxies with f 5th > 13 lie within two highly con-
centrated groups of four and six galaxies within 30 arcsec diameter
apertures. We then apply the same f 5th > 13 cut to deﬁne group
galaxies within the protocluster sample. The difference in luminos-
ity completeness due to the different redshifts does not matter be-
cause f 5th is deﬁned as the relative density within a particular sam-
ple. The dividing line of overlapping groups is taken to be where
f 5th is a minimum between the groups.

The selection of galaxies deﬁned as group members does not
strongly depend on the choice of density estimator, or the choice of
the number of nearest neighbours. This is because the relative den-

sity of each galaxy is very similar for n between 3 and 10. Since
the boundary between group and intergroup galaxies is not abso-
lute, but rather is deﬁned as the density that selects the two groups
in the control ﬁeld, we select approximately the same galaxies as
group galaxies regardless of the choice of n. We tested our results
for n ranging between 3 and 8 and found no signiﬁcant difference
in the number, size or total stellar masses of the groups identiﬁed
in the protocluster. Therefore our results and conclusions are robust
against changes in the choice of n. However, for n > 10 the spatial
resolution of the density map is not sufﬁcient to pick out groups
on the scale of a few hundred kpc in either the control ﬁeld or the
protocluster.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Completeness and contamination level of the protocluster

galaxy sample

We use the spectroscopic cluster sample of Tran et al. (2015),
and the grism sample of Momcheva et al. (2015) to determine the
completeness and contamination level of the protocluster sample.
Tran et al. (2015) presents data on 109 good quality spectra of
galaxies in and near Cl 0218.3−0510. The targeted galaxies were
bright and priority was given to galaxies with photometric red-
shifts that lay close to the cluster’s redshift. The images presented
in this work only cover part of the region from which the spectra
of Tran et al. (2015) were obtained, so only 69 spectroscopically
observed galaxies are covered by our images. All redshifts are de-
termined through line emission so all spectroscopically measured
objects host an active galactic nucleus or signiﬁcant star formation.
Tran et al. (2015) deﬁnes cluster members as those which
have a redshift within 1.612 < z < 1.635. The cluster is deﬁned
as the main halo of the protocluster, whereas protocluster galax-

c(cid:13) RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

ies may lie tens of cMpc beyond the main protocluster halo and
can have relative velocities up to 2000 km s−1 (Contini et al. 2015).
We therefore deﬁne protocluster galaxies as those with redshifts in
the interval 1.59 < z < 1.67. There are 35 spectroscopically con-
ﬁrmed galaxies in this redshift interval and in the area we survey.
We identify 31 of these 35 galaxies as protocluster candidates us-
ing our photometric redshift method, resulting in a completeness of
89 ± 5%.

We selected 35 out of 69 spectroscopic galaxies in the
Tran et al. (2015) sample as protocluster candidates using our
method. One of these has an ambiguous spectroscopic red-
shift as it is deﬁned as a cluster member with z = 1.634 by
Tanaka, Finoguenov & Ueda (2010), but deﬁned as an interloper
by Tran et al. (2015) (although no redshift is published). From the
rest of the 34 galaxies, four have spectroscopic redshifts outside
1.59 < z < 1.67 and are therefore contaminants. Therefore the con-
tamination rate of our protocluster catalogue is only 12 ± 5%.

The galaxies with spectra span a similar range of stellar mass
and i′ magnitude as the bulk of the photometric-redshift selected
protocluster sample (9.2 < log M/ M⊙ < 10.7 and 23 < i′ < 25.5)
so the contamination rate of 12% is likely to be correct for most
mass and luminosity bins in our protocluster catalogue. The com-
pleteness, however, is a strong function of galaxy luminosity and
type (Hatch et al. in prep.). The spectroscopic success rate is
strongly biased toward emission line sources, so the completion
rate of 89 ± 5% should be considered the percentage of star form-
ing or active galaxies with logM/ M⊙ > 9.7 that can be detected.
There is a bias in comparing our catalogue to the Tran et al.
(2015) sample because their sample was selected for spectroscopic
followup based on photometric redshifts. Neither our sample nor
the Tran et al. (2015) sample would locate galaxies whose SEDs re-
sult in erroneous photometric redshifts. So our completeness may
be overestimated. We therefore compare our sample to the grism
survey of 3D-HST (Momcheva et al. 2015), who make no prese-

galaxy sample for various P5s and P2s selection parameters. The optimal
values for identifying protocluster structure occurs when contamination is
∼< 15% and completeness is
∼> 80%. This occurs when 0.8 <P5s < 0.9 and

lection based on photometric redshifts. Forty of our protocluster
galaxy candidates have redshifts derived from a ﬁt to both the pho-
tometric and grism data, of which only ﬁve do not have 68% con-
ﬁdence intervals that span z = 1.6233 and are thus interlopers. So
the contamination rate is 13 ± 5%.

We can select protocluster candidates from the 3D-HST cat-
alogues using the the maximum likelihood redshift parameter as
those which satisfy 1.59 < z max grism < 1.67. Using this method
we ﬁnd 24 protocluster candidates which are bright enough to be
selected by our photometric redshift method and data. Twenty-one
of these are selected as protocluster members. So the completeness
is 88 ±7%. It is reassuring that the completeness and contamination
rates derived from two different data sets are in perfect agreement.
In Fig. 4 we use all spectroscopically conﬁrmed galaxies to
show how the completeness and contamination changes as the pro-
tocluster galaxy selection parameters (P5s and P2s ) are varied.
Neither the completeness or contamination vary greatly when the
parameters range from P5s > 0.8 and P2s > 0.5 to P5s > 0.9
and P2s > 0.6. Within this range, the number of protocluster
galaxies selected varies only by ±25, and all of the following re-
sults and conclusions are robust to this small change in the proto-
cluster galaxy sample.

By choosing stricter or more relaxed selection criteria one
can select either a cleaner sample or more complete sample of
protocluster galaxies. Both of these samples are not appropriate
for mapping the protocluster structure. A large number of inter-
lopers smooth out the protocluster structure, so the groups are no
long obvious when the selection parameters are less stringent than
P5s > 0.8 and P2s >0.4. On the other hand, there are too few
galaxies to identify groups when the parameters are more stringent
than P5s > 0.9 and P2s > 0.7. The optimal values for identi-
fying protocluster structure occurs when the interloper fraction is
less than approximately 15% and the completeness (for bright star
forming galaxies) is more than 80%. For our data this occurs when
0.8 <P5s < 0.9 and 0.5 <P2s < 0.6.

ways. First, the protocluster contains a greater number of galaxy
groups, which generally contain much more stellar mass than the
control ﬁeld groups. Second, the galaxy density between the groups
is much higher. Both of these structural features signify the pres-
ence of the protocluster.

3.2.1 Protocluster galaxy groups

A key feature of the structure of this protocluster is the presence of
several galaxy groups that are signiﬁcantly more massive than those
found in the control ﬁeld. The galaxy density of each of the groups
is not much greater than the control groups, but the stellar mass
density is signiﬁcantly larger, and they appear prominent in maps
of projected stellar mass density. The galaxies in the protocluster
groups are, on average, more massive than those in control ﬁeld
groups.

The largest and most massive group (group 1) lies at the loca-
tion of the tentative 4.5s detection of X-ray emission reported by
Tanaka, Finoguenov & Ueda (2010). The total mass of this group
is estimated from the X-ray luminosity to be 5.7[±1.4] × 1013 M⊙,
which is consistent with the mass estimated from the velocity
dispersion of s group 1 = 254 ± 50 km s−1 (Tran et al. 2015). This
dense core is surrounded by ﬁve additional galaxy groups, which
are listed in Table 2. The separate groups can be more easily iden-
tiﬁed in Fig. 6. Group 2 also has a weak 1.5s X-ray detection re-
ported by Tanaka, Finoguenov & Ueda (2010).

Groups 5 and 6 are compact groups with very high galaxy
densities, but they contain relatively little stellar mass and are sim-
ilar to groups A and B found in the control ﬁeld. As this type of
low mass group is found in both environments it is unlikely that
these structures are unique signatures of the protocluster. By con-
trast, groups 1 − 4 are very different types of structures to the low
mass groups in the control ﬁeld. These groups contain more stellar
mass than is found in either of the control ﬁeld groups, and they are
prominent features in the stellar mass density maps. Since the ratio
of stellar to dark matter mass is expected to change once galaxies
exceed 1010.5 M⊙, it is likely that the dark matter mass distribution
in this protocluster is even more skewed towards these four groups
than the stellar mass density map suggests.

Many algorithms for ﬁnding protoclusters concentrate on lo-
cating large galaxy overdensities. Such overdensities are prone to
detrimental line of sight projection effects and so protocluster can-
didate catalogues are plagued with contaminants. The maps pre-

sented here suggest that protoclusters may be more prominent as
stellar mass overdensities rather than galaxy overdensities.

3.2.2 Protocluster intergroup galaxies

A distinct feature of the protocluster is the high galaxy and stel-
lar mass density in between the groups. We refer to these galaxies
as the ‘intergroup’ galaxies. The projected density of intergroup
galaxies is 2.5 times greater than in the control ﬁeld3. Unlike the
overdensity in the groups, there is no enhancement of the stellar
mass density over the galaxy density: the projected stellar mass
density of the protocluster as a whole is only a factor of two greater
than the control ﬁeld. These results are robust against changes to the
choice of the density estimator, or the value of nth nearest neigh-
bours. The enhancement in galaxy density does not lie immediately
outside the groups, but rather is evenly spread across all of the in-
tergroup region.

Most of the protocluster galaxies lie between the groups.
Within the limited ﬁeld-of-view 11% of the protocluster galaxies
are in the most massive group, 22% in the additional groups and the
remaining 67% reside between the groups. The fraction of galaxies
in the most massive group is an upper limit as there are likely to be
additional protocluster galaxies beyond the observed window. Pro-
toclusters extend over several Mpc so the observations presented
here are not likely to encompass the entire protocluster structure
(Muldrew, Hatch & Cooke 2015).

3.3 Biased views of protoclusters from observing only galaxy

subsets

Protoclusters are commonly observed by selecting only one type
of member galaxy such as line-emitting galaxies (Hayashi et al.
2012; Koyama et al. 2013) or red galaxies (Kajisawa et al. 2006;
Hatch et al. 2011a). In Fig. 6 we explore what the structure of
Cl 0218.3−0510 looks like when we limit our observations to only
red protocluster members (z − J > 1.3), or star-forming members
with an observed SFR > 5 M⊙ yr−1 . The red population includes
passive galaxies and star forming galaxies with signiﬁcant amounts
of dust obscuration (AV > 1 mag). The star forming population is
akin to unobscured populations such as Lyman break galaxies, and
Lya , [OII] or Ha emitters. The structures of the protocluster re-
vealed by the two types of galaxies are disparate.

The most massive group appears in both maps, and both types
of galaxies identify some of the other galaxy groups. The red galax-
ies locate the massive groups (1, 2 and 3), but do not ﬁnd the lower-
mass groups 4, 5 and 6. The converse is true for the star forming
galaxies, which locate groups 1, 4, 5 and 6 but do not identify the
massive groups 2 and 3. It is therefore possible that emission line
maps of protoclusters are unable to locate some of the most mas-
sive groups in the protocluster. Red galaxies do a poor job of trac-
ing the intergroup galaxies, whereas the structure of the intergroup
ﬁlaments is well-traced by star forming protocluster galaxies.

Comparing the maps of Fig. 5 to Fig. 6 illustrates that study-
ing the protocluster with only one type of galaxy can severely bias
our view of the protocluster. It is likely that galaxy groups would
be entirely missed by studying the protocluster in either red or star
forming galaxies, and the red galaxies do a poor job at locating the

enhanced density of intergroup galaxies. Protoclusters are there-
fore far more complex structures than their lower-redshift cluster
descendants, whose structure can be traced well by galaxies that
lie on a red sequence in colour-magnitude space. Galaxies are still
rapidly forming in protoclusters and galaxy formation appears to
be unevenly distributed. To view the complete structure and see the
full complexity of the protocluster we must identify all types of
protocluster galaxies.

4 DISCUSSION

Comparing observations of protoclusters and clusters at different
redshifts can reveal how clusters form and galaxies evolve, but only
if we can statistically link protocluster ancestors and cluster descen-
dants that follow the same evolutionary paths. Clusters in the local
Universe come in a variety of sizes, so to trace cluster formation
it is imperative that we are able to distinguish the progenitors of
different types of clusters in their protocluster state.

The crux of the problem is determining what the end product
of a protocluster will be and how it will evolve to get there. Clusters
form by the accumulation of galaxies from the ﬁeld and by merging
with smaller groups. This process is stochastic so the most massive
clusters at any observed redshift will not necessarily become the
most massive clusters by the present day (although they are statis-
tically more likely to do so). By observing a large fraction of the
Cl 0218.3−0510 protocluster we have determined what material is
available to grow the cluster, and where that material is located.
The structure of the protocluster gives us additional information to
constrain the future evolution of the forming cluster. In this section
we show how large N-body cosmological simulations can be used
to determine a protocluster’s evolution and present-day mass from
observations of the protocluster structure.

4.1 Millennium Simulation counterparts to Cl 0218.3−0510

We construct a sample of simulated galaxy protoclusters that
have similar structural properties to Cl 0218.3−0510 using the
Henriques et al. (2015) semi-analytic model applied to the Millen-
nium Simulation (Springel et al. 2005) scaled to the Planck Cos-
mology (Planck Collaboration XVI 2014). The simulated box is
periodic of side length 480 Mpc h−1 where h = 0.673. The clos-
est snapshot to the observations of Cl 0218.3−0510 was z = 1.613.
We ﬁrst select main halos with the same mass as the X-ray-derived
mass of the main halo of Cl 0218.3−0510 by identiﬁng 652 dark
matter halos, in this snapshot, with masses in the range 4.3 <
M/1013 M⊙ < 7.1 that were the main halos of their cluster forma-
tion tree. We then selected a 10.2 × 10.2 × 34.0 cMpc box around
these halos and identiﬁed 40 Cl 0218.3−0510–like protoclusters as
the subset whose dark matter halos within this box have mass ratios
similar to the stellar mass ratio of the groups in Cl 0218.3−0510,
i.e. 1 : 0.40 : 0.29 : 0.12 : 0.11: 0.04, with a range of ±0.1 in each
of these ratios. We chose the 10.2 × 10.2 × 34.0 cMpc box size
because the observed ﬁeld of view is 10.2 cMpc at the protoclus-
ter’s redshift, and we chose a 34 cMpc depth because the simulated
galaxy overdensity in this volume is similar to the observed galaxy
overdensity of Cl 0218.3−0510. It is reasonable to use the ratio of
the stellar masses as a proxy for the total mass ratios since the total
stellar mass of galaxy groups is proportional to the viral mass in the
model of Henriques et al. (2015).

protoclusters with a similar structure to Cl 0218.3−0510. Similar

galaxies are pink whilst intergroup galaxies are black. Filled circles are galaxies that will merge to form the cluster by z = 0 and the open circles are those that
do not fall in by the present day and are therefore contaminants to the protocluster sample at z ∼ 1.6.

to the real 2D distribution of Cl 0218.3−0510, the protocluster con-
sists of a small number of groups enveloped by intergroup galaxies
which appear to have a random distribution across the whole ﬁeld.
Viewing the intergroup galaxies in the Z-Y plane allows us to see
the wider structure. Large numbers of galaxies surround the groups
and the protocluster core is characterised by a high density of these
galaxies.

Protoclusters in simulations are large structures, with the most
massive having galaxies spread across 50 cMpc (∼ 32′) at z ∼ 2.
However, the groups are very centrally concentrated with 77% of
groups residing within ±5 cMpc of the most massive halo. The in-
tergroup galaxies are still centrally concentrated, but less so than
the groups, with 52% of intergroup galaxies residing within the
central 10 cMpc. To determine the structure of the protocluster it is
important to observe all of the galaxy groups that make up the pro-
tocluster, whereas the intergroup galaxies are of less importance. So
to measure the protocluster structure it is sufﬁcient to obtain precise
photometric redshifts over a small ﬁeld of view of approximately
5 − 10′ radius centred on the most massive protocluster group.

In section 2.2.3 we discussed the possibility that the con-
trol ﬁeld sample may be less complete than the protocluster by
∼ 22% due to the higher photometric redshift errors at redshifts
away from z = 1.62. If the control ﬁeld has an additional incom-
pleteness to this level the depth of the protocluster increases from
34 cMpc to 41 cMpc. This does not affect the following analysis
since our selection of Cl 0218.3−0510-like protoclusters depends
only on the galaxy groups, and most of the groups lie within the
central ±5cMpc of the protocluster. We obtain almost identical re-
sults in the following discussion whether the protocluster depth is
41.0 cMpc or 34.0 cMpc.

Observations only provide estimates of galaxy properties,
such as stellar mass. Therefore in any observational survey the ob-
served stellar mass distribution may be systematically biased, or
have a wider distribution than the simulated stellar mass distribu-
tion. Our method for identifying Cl 0218.3−0510-like protoclus-
ters removes much of this bias by using the ratio of total stellar
masses of the groups to determine the ratio of dark matter halo

c(cid:13) RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

masses. Our method therefore crucially relies on the assumption
that stellar mass directly traces dark matter, and that the total mass
of group 1 is well constrained, but our method is not affected by
the bias between observed and simulated galaxy properties.

4.2 The z = 0 mass of Cl 0218.3−0510

By mapping the structure of the protocluster we have constrained
the allowed growth rate of the cluster and therefore limited the
allowed range of present-day cluster mass (Mz=0). In Fig. 8 we
show the distribution of Mz=0 for all 652 dark matter main halos
in the Millennium Simulation at z = 1.61 with masses in the range
4.3 < M/1013 M⊙ < 7.1 in blue, and those 40 protoclusters with
the same structure as Cl 0218.3−0510 in orange. Without taking
into account the protocluster structure Mz=0 is poorly constrained
and the present-day cluster mass may be anything in the range of
1013.9−15.5 M⊙.

The 40 simulated Cl 0218.3−0510-like protoclusters have a
narrower range of Mz=0. All of the Cl 0218.3−0510-like protoclus-
ters become clusters with masses in the range 1.0 < M/1014 M⊙ <
6.6. The median present day mass of Cl 0218.3−0510-like descen-
dants is 2.7 × 1014 M⊙, therefore it is likely that Cl 0218.3−0510
will become a cluster with a slightly lower mass than the Virgo
(4.4 < M/1014 M⊙ < 7.4; Hoffman, Olson & Salpeter
cluster
1980) by the present day.

This result relies on a number of assumptions: (i) that the
initial mass of Cl 0218.3−0510 is 4.3 < M/1013 M⊙ < 7.1; (ii)
that our method unambiguously locates galaxy groups; and (iii)
that stellar mass exactly traces dark matter mass in the groups. Of
these three assumptions, the present day mass of Cl 0218.3−0510
most critically depends on whether we know the mass of the main
halo at z = 1.62. Independent analyses of X-ray data from both
Chandra and XMM-Newton (Tanaka, Finoguenov & Ueda 2010;
Finoguenov et al. 2010; Pierre et al. 2012) and dynamical velocity
dispersion estimates (Tran et al. 2015) are all consistent with our
assumed initial mass, however we caution that estimates for group
and cluster masses at this redshift are highly uncertain.

4.3 Tracing ancestor protoclusters and descendant clusters

Mapping the structure of the protocluster at z ∼ 1.6 allows us to
estimate its state at all redshifts. In Fig. 9 we show the evolution of

the 652 main dark matter halos in the Millennium Simulation with
4.3 < M/1013 M⊙ < 7.1 in blue, and for the Cl 0218.3−0510-like
simulated protoclusters in orange. Based on this, the most rapid
period of growth for Cl 0218.3−0510 occurs at z > 2. In 2.5 bil-
lion years the main halo of the protocluster grows by a factor of
20 − 100. Its growth from the observed epoch of z = 1.6 to the
present is more muted, with only a factor of 2 − 8 increase in mass.
The clusters that grow more at z < 1 than Cl 0218.3−0510 are ei-
ther surrounded by more massive halos or have a larger number
of nearby halos. Approximately 60% of the faster growing clusters
have more massive second-ranked halos, and 50% have more mass
in their six most massive halos compared to Cl 0218.3−0510.

The structure of Cl 0218.3−0510 allows us to improve our
estimates for its descendant mass at all redshifts, in particular it
strongly constrains the upper limit of its mass at all redshifts. How-
ever very little improvement is made in constraining the mass of
its ancestor protoclusters. The future growth of Cl 0218.3−0510 is
constrained because we are able to estimate how much material is
available for future consumption. But the wide-ﬁeld protocluster
structure does not relay any information about its main halo mass
prior to the epoch of observation, so we are unable to constrain the
ancestor protoclusters that will form Cl 0218.3−0510.

These results demonstrate that the structure of a protocluster
can help constrain its evolutionary path. By mapping the structures
of a large sample of protoclusters and clusters across 5 > z > 0
we can place the (proto)clusters in evolutionary sequences that de-
scribe how clusters form. If we can reliably determine which galax-
ies in each observation will become cluster members, then the se-
quences of evolving clusters also provide samples of galaxy an-
cestors and descendants for a closed system of galaxies. Such se-
quences are powerful tools for studying the evolution of galaxies.

4.4 Is Cl 0218.3−0510 a typical ancestor of Virgo-mass

clusters?

In Section 4.2 we found that Cl 0218.3−0510 is likely to become a
cluster of similar mass to Virgo by the present day. We can therefore
ask the question, ‘do the progenitors of Virgo-like clusters all look
like Cl 0218.3−0510?’ To answer this question we extracted from
the Planck-scaled Millennium catalogue all dark matter haloes at
z = 0 with virial masses in the range 1 < M/1014 M⊙ < 6. We
selected from this a subsample that matched the z = 0 mass distri-

evolutionary paths, which we display in Fig. 10.

The evolutionary growth of Cl 0218.3−0510 is not atypical of
Virgo-like clusters: its most likely evolutionary path is consistent
with many clusters that end up with similar z = 0 masses. However,
the main group at z = 1.62 is larger than average, with 77% of clus-
ters having lower masses at this redshift. This means that a larger
fraction of the galaxies in Cl 0218.3−0510 will spend a longer time
in the dense group environment than is typical for such clusters,
and environmental quenching of star formation would have started
early for a larger fraction of its members. A signature of this early
assembly may be visible in the stellar populations of its descendant
clusters as we would expect the mean stellar age of its member
galaxies to be older than most clusters of similar mass.

4.5 Which of the Cl 0218.3−0510 galaxies will become

cluster galaxies

A major issue in photometric redshift surveys of galaxy clusters
or protoclusters is the contamination level by line-of-sight inter-
lopers. By sampling the Balmer and 4000 ˚A breaks of the proto-
cluster galaxies, we were able to obtain precise photometric red-
shifts, and the contamination level due to photometric redshift
uncertainty is only 12%. However some galaxies within the vol-
ume of the protocluster do not fall into the cluster by z = 0
(Muldrew, Hatch & Cooke 2015; Contini et al. 2015). Therefore
not all galaxies that have similar redshifts as the main halo will fall
into the cluster, and some of the ‘protocluster galaxies’ selected in
Section 2.2.3 will not be true cluster progenitors.

We use the Planck-scaled Millennium Simulation with the
semi-analytic model of Henriques et al. (2015) to determine which
of Cl 0218.3−0510’s galaxies will become cluster members by

z = 0. Using the 40 Cl 0218.3−0510-like protoclusters at z = 1.61
in the Millennium Simulation we select all galaxies within boxes
of 10.2 × 10.2 × 34 cMpc volume around the main haloes, and then
follow their evolution to determine if they become cluster members.
In Fig. 11 we show the probability a galaxy will become a
cluster member if it lies at a certain projected radius from the main
halo. Although there is a large dispersion between radius and pro-
jected radius, there is still a strong correlation between projected
radius and the probability a galaxy will fall into the cluster. Galax-
ies within 2 cMpc of the main halo have more than 80% chance of
becoming cluster galaxies, whereas those that lie more than 6 cMpc
away have only a 60% chance of making it into the cluster. 4

80, 70 and 60% of the galaxies are likely to become cluster members by
z = 0. White circles mark galaxies, and background colour scale indicates
the relative galaxy density determined as the cumulative distance to the 5th
nearest neighbour.

The chance of becoming a cluster member also depends on
whether the galaxy lies within a group or between the groups. In
Fig. 11 we divide the galaxies into those which lie in groups more
massive than the smallest group of Cl 0218.3−0510, and those
which lie in smaller groups or between the groups (labelled as inter-
group galaxies). At all radii group galaxies are approximately 10%
more likely to become cluster galaxies than intergroup galaxies,
but for both subsets the probability of becoming a cluster member
diminishes with increasing projected distance.

In Fig. 12 we mark the probability that the Cl 0218.3−0510
galaxies will become cluster members by z = 0. Galaxies in group
1 are already cluster members. Galaxies in groups 3, 4 and 5 have
more than 85% chance of becoming cluster members, whilst mem-
bers of the massive group 2 have an 80% probability, and even
members of group 6, which lies 5.7 cMpc from the main halo have
a high (> 70%) chance of falling into the cluster.

A large fraction of the observed intergroup galaxies are also
likely to fall into the cluster. Although most potential cluster mem-
bers of Cl 0218.3−0510 are intergroup galaxies at z ∼ 1.6, Fig. 12
shows that the intergroup sample contains a higher level of con-
tamination than the groups. The cleanest sample of true protoclus-
ter galaxies consists of those that reside in the groups surrounding
a protocluster, but this sample is highly incomplete, and possibly
biased due to environmental galaxy evolution processes occurring
in the dense groups.

of 41cMpc rather than 34cMpc. This results in the probabilities of Figs. 11

5 CONCLUSIONS

We use ∼ 1% precision photometric redshifts of Cl 0218.3−0510 to
select a sample of protocluster galaxies that is both clean and com-
plete enough to trace the wide-ﬁeld structure of the protocluster. We
obtain these high precision redshifts by observing the protoclus-
ter with narrow bands that tightly bracket the Balmer and 4000 ˚A
breaks of the protocluster galaxies.

We ﬁnd that two structural features signify the presence of
the protocluster: a large number of massive galaxy groups, and a
high density of galaxies that lie between the groups. The groups
are prominent features in maps of stellar mass density. We con-
clude that protoclusters may be more reliably identiﬁed as stel-
lar mass overdensities rather than galaxy overdensities, which are
more prone to line-of-sight contamination.

We show that future studies of protoclusters should avoid ex-
amining the protocluster using only one type of galaxy as this can
severely bias our view of the protocluster. We have shown that some
galaxy groups are entirely missed when studying the protocluster
through only red or star forming galaxies, and the red galaxies do
not locate the majority of the intergroup galaxies. Protoclusters are
cradles of forming galaxies, but the formation of these galaxies is
unevenly distributed. To view the whole structure and see the full
complexity of the protocluster we must identify all the different
types of protocluster galaxies.

By observing a large fraction of the Cl 0218.3−0510 proto-
cluster we have determined how much material is available to grow
the cluster. Using cosmological simulations to identify protoclus-
ters with the same structure as Cl 0218.3−0510 we estimate that
it will grow into a 2.7+3.9
−1.7 × 1014 M⊙ cluster by the present day.
We mapped the evolutionary growth of Cl 0218.3−0510 and found
that while its evolution is not atypical, the mass of the main halo
of Cl 0218.3−0510 at z = 1.62 is larger than 77% of galaxy groups
that end up with the same ﬁnal mass. In comparison to other clus-
ters with the same ﬁnal mass, environmental quenching started ear-
lier for a larger fraction of Cl 0218.3−0510 members.

We further use the simulations to assign a probability to each
galaxy in the protocluster map of becoming a cluster member by
z = 0. The probability of becoming a cluster member rapidly dimin-
ishes with increasing projected distance. At the same radii, group
galaxies are more likely to become cluster galaxies than the in-
tergroup galaxies, and there is a very high probability that all 6
galaxy groups in Cl 0218.3−0510 will coalesce to form a clus-
ter. The cleanest sample of cluster galaxy progenitors consists of
those that reside in the groups within a couple of Mpc of the largest
group, but this sample will be highly incomplete, and possibly bi-
ased due to environmental galaxy evolution processes occurring in
the dense groups.

We have demonstrated that the future evolutionary growth of
a protocluster can be estimated from its structure. By mapping the
architectures of a large sample of protoclusters and clusters across
5 > z > 0 we can place them in evolutionary sequences that describe
how clusters form. Such sequences are powerful tools for studying
how galaxies form and evolve in a dynamic environment.
