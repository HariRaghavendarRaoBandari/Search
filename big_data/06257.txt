Abstract

We investigate Frobenius algebras and symmetric algebras in the monoidal category of
right comodules over a Hopf algebra H; for the symmetric property H is assumed to be
cosovereign. If H is ﬁnite dimensional and A is an H-comodule algebra, we uncover the
connection between A and the smash product A#H ∗ with respect to the Frobenius and
symmetric properties.

Introduction and preliminaries

We work over a basic ﬁeld k. A ﬁnite dimensional algebra A is called Frobenius if A and its
dual A∗ are isomorphic as left (or equivalently, as right) A-modules. Frobenius algebras arise in
representation theory, Hopf algebra theory, quantum groups, cohomology of compact oriented
manifolds, topological quantum ﬁeld theory, the theory of subfactors and of extensions of C ∗-
algebras, the quantum Yang-Baxter equation, etc., see [13]. A rich representation theory has
been uncovered for such algebras, see [14], [19]. It was showed in [1], [2] that A is Frobenius
if and only if it also has a coalgebra structure whose comultiplication is a morphism of A, A-
bimodules. This equivalent deﬁnition of the Frobenius property has the advantage that it makes
sense in any monoidal category. The study of Frobenius algebras in monoidal categories was
initiated in [15], [20], [21], and such objects have occurred in several contexts, for example in
the theory of Morita equivalences of tensor categories, in conformal quantum ﬁeld theory, in
reconstruction theorems for modular tensor categories, see more details and references in [11],
[12], [16]; recent developments can be also found in [5].

The representation theory of Frobenius algebras uncovers several symmetry features, for
example there is a duality between the categories of left and right ﬁnitely generated modules,
and the lattices of left and right ideals are anti-isomorphic. Among Frobenius algebras there
is a class of objects having even more symmetry. These are the symmetric algebras A, for
which A and A∗ are isomorphic as A, A-bimodules. The category of commutative symmetric
algebras is equivalent to the category of 2-dimensional topological quantum ﬁeld theories, see
[1]. Symmetric algebras appear in block theory of group algebras in positive characteristic, see
[19, Chapter IV].

It is not clear how one could deﬁne symmetric algebras in an arbitrary monoidal category.
Symmetric algebras in monoidal categories with certain properties were ﬁrst considered in [10], as

structures related to correlation functions in conformal ﬁeld theories. In [11] symmetric algebras
are discussed in sovereign monoidal categories. In this paper we consider the monoidal category
MH of right comodules (or corepresentations) over a Hopf algebra H. If A is an algebra in this
category, i.e. a right H-comodule algebra, then A ∈ AMH
A , i.e. A is a left (A, H)-Doi-Hopf
module and a right (A, H)-Doi-Hopf module. On the other hand, A∗ is a right (A, H)-Doi-Hopf
module, but not necessarily a left (A, H)-Doi-Hopf module; however A∗ has a natural structure
of a left (A(S2), H)-Doi-Hopf module, where A(S2) is the algebra A with the coaction shifted
by S2, where S is the antipode of H. If H is cosovereign, i.e. there exists a character u on H
such that S2(h) = P u−1(h1)u(h3)h2 for any h ∈ H, then A ≃ A(S2) as comodule algebras, and
this induces a structure of A∗ as an object in AMH
A , where the left A-action is a deformation
of the usual one by u. Then it makes sense to consider when A and A∗ are isomorphic in this
category; in this case we say that A is symmetric in MH with respect to u, or shortly that A
is (H, u)-symmetric. As MH is a sovereign monoidal category for such H, this is a special case
of the general concept of symmetric algebra considered in [11]. In Section 2 we give explicit
characterizations of this property in MH. We show that the deﬁnition of symmetry depends
on the character (i.e. on the associated sovereign structure of MH). Also, we use a modiﬁed
version of the trivial extension construction to give examples of (H, u)-symmetric algebras of
In the case where H is involutory, i.e. S2 = Id, H is cosovereign if we
corepresentations.
take u = ε, the counit of H, and in this case it is clear that an (H, ε)-symmetric algebra is
also symmetric as a k-algebra. However, we show that in general H may be (H, u)-symmetric,
without being symmetric as a k-algebra.

Given a ﬁnite dimensional algebra A in the category MH , where H is a ﬁnite dimensional
Hopf algebra, one can construct the smash product A#H ∗. Smash products are also called
semidirect products, since the group algebra of a semidirect product of groups is just a smash
product. Smash product constructions are of great relevance since they describe the algebra
structure in a process of bosonization, which associates for instance a Hopf algebra to a Hopf
superalgebra. It is proved in [4] that A is Frobenius if and only if so is A#H ∗. On the other hand,
we show in an example that such a good connection does not hold for the symmetric property. In
Section 3 we show that if A is a Frobenius algebra in MH , then A#H ∗ is a Frobenius algebra in
MH ∗, but the converse does not hold. In Section 4 we uncover a good transfer of the symmetry
property between A and A#H ∗, more precisely we show that A is (H, α)-symmetric if and
only if A#H ∗ is (H ∗, g)-symmetric, where g and α are the distinguished grouplike (or modular)
elements of H and H ∗, provided that H is cosovereign by α, and H ∗ is cosovereign by g.

For basic concepts and notation on Hopf algebras we refer to [8], [18].

2 Frobenius algebras and symmetric algebras of corepresenta-

tions

Let H be a Hopf algebra, and let A be a ﬁnite dimensional right H-comodule algebra, with
H-coaction a 7→ P a0 ⊗ a1. Then there exists an element Pi ai ⊗ hi ⊗ a∗
i ∈ A ⊗ H ⊗ A∗ such
that P a0 ⊗ a1 = Pi a∗
i (a)ai ⊗ hi for any a ∈ A; this element corresponds to the H-comodule
structure map of A through the natural isomorphism A ⊗ H ⊗ A∗ ≃ Hom(A, A ⊗ H). A right
H-comodule structure is induced on A∗ by

a∗ 7→ X

a∗(ai)a∗

i ⊗ S(hi),

for any a∗ ∈ A∗.

If we consider the left H ∗-actions on A and A∗ associated with these right H-comodule structures,
denoted by h∗ · a and h∗ · a∗ for h∗ ∈ H ∗, a ∈ A, a∗ ∈ A∗, we have

(h∗ · a∗)(a) = X

h∗(S(hi))a∗(ai)a∗

i (a)

i

= a∗(X

h∗(S(hi))a∗

i (a)ai)

i

= a∗((h∗S) · a)

so

(h∗ · a∗)(a) = a∗((h∗S) · a)

(1)

Moreover, A∗ ∈ MH
A , with the usual right A-action; this means that the A-module structure
of A∗ is right H-colinear. It is known (see [6, Theorem 2.4]) that the following are equivalent:
(1) A ≃ A∗ in MH
A ; (2) There exists a nondegenerate associative bilinear form B : A × A → k
such that B(h∗ · a, b) = B(a, (h∗S) · b) for any a, b ∈ A, h∗ ∈ H ∗; (3) There exists a linear map
λ : A → k such that λ(h∗ · a) = h∗(1)λ(a) for any a ∈ A, h∗ ∈ H ∗, and Ker λ does not contain a
non-zero right ideal of A; (4) There exists a linear map λ : A → k such that λ(h∗ ·a) = h∗(1)λ(a)
for any a ∈ A, h∗ ∈ H ∗, and Ker λ does not contain a non-zero subobject of A in MH
A ; (5) A is a
Frobenius algebra in the category MH. The connections between an isomorphism θ : A → A∗ as
in (1), a bilinear map B as in (2) and a linear map λ as in (3), (4) are given by θ(a)(b) = B(a, b),
λ(a) = B(1, a), B(a, b) = λ(ab).

On the other hand, A∗ is also a left A-module in a natural way, but in general A∗ is not
an object of AMH (with a similar compatibility condition for the A-action and H-coaction).
However, A∗ is an object in A(S2)MH , where A(S2) is just the algebra A, with the H-coaction
shifted by S2, i.e. a 7→ P a0 ⊗ S2(a1).

Assume now that H is a cosovereign Hopf algebra in the sense of [3], i.e. there exists a
character u on H (in other words, u is a grouplike element of the dual Hopf algebra H ∗, or
equivalently, an algebra morphism from H to k) such that S2(h) = P u−1(h1)u(h3)h2 for any
h ∈ H; this is the same with (S2)∗ being an inner algebra automorphism of H ∗ via u. Following
[3], we say that u is a sovereign character of H. Then f : A → A(S2), f (a) = u−1 · a =
P u−1(a1)a0, is an isomorphism of right H-comodule algebras, and it induces an isomorphism
of categories

F : A(S2)MH → AMH

where for M ∈ A(S2)MH, F (M ) is just M , with the same H-coaction, and A-action ∗ given
by a ∗ m = f (a)m, for any a ∈ A and m ∈ M . By restriction, this induces an isomorphism of
categories (and we denote it by F , too)

Now A∗ ∈ A(S2)MH

F : A(S2)MH
A , so then F (A∗) ∈ AMH
A .

A → AMH

Deﬁnition 2.1 Let H be a cosovereign Hopf algebra with u as a sovereign character. A ﬁnite
dimensional right H-comodule algebra A is a symmetric algebra in the category MH with respect
to u if F (A∗) ≃ A in the category AMH
A . In this case we simply say that A is (H, u)-symmetric.

Now we give equivalent characterizations of this property. The next result can be derived
from [11, Proposition 4.6], using the structure of duals in a category of corepresentations. In our
sketch of proof, explicit description is given for several ways to describe symmetry of algebras
of corepresentations.

Proposition 2.2 Let A be a right H-comodule algebra, where H is a cosovereign Hopf algebra.
Keeping the above notation, the following are equivalent.
(1) A is (H, u)-symmetric.
(2) There exists a nondegenerate bilinear form B : A × A → k such that B(b, ca) = B(bf (c), a),
B(b, a) = B(f (a), b), and B(b, h∗ · a) = B((h∗S) · b, a) for any a, b, c ∈ A, h∗ ∈ H ∗.
(3) There exists a linear map λ : A → k such that λ(ba) = λ(af (b)) and λ(h∗ · a) = h∗(1)λ(a)
for any a, b ∈ A, h∗ ∈ H ∗, and also Ker λ does not contain a non-zero right ideal of A.
(4) There exists a linear map λ : A → k such that λ(ba) = λ(af (b)) and λ(h∗ · a) = h∗(1)λ(a)
for any a, b ∈ A, h∗ ∈ H ∗, and also Ker λ does not contain a non-zero subobject of A in MH
A .
More equivalent conditions can be added if we change right ideal with left ideal in (3), and MH
A
with AMH in (4).

Proof We combine the proof of the equivalent characterizations of a symmetric algebra in the
category of vector spaces, see [14, Theorem 16.54], and [6, Theorem 2.4], recalled above. Thus
for (1) ⇔ (2), if θ : A → F (A∗) is a linear map, then let B : A × A → k be the bilinear map
deﬁned by B(a, b) = θ(b)(a). Then it is straightforward to check that θ is left A-linear if and
only if

and θ is right A-linear if and only if

B(b, ca) = B(bf (c), a)

for any a, b, c ∈ A,

B(b, ac) = B(cb, a)

for any a, b, c ∈ A.

We see that if (2) and (3) hold, then B(b, a) = B(b, a1) = B(bf (a), 1) = B(f (a), b), thus

B(b, a) = B(f (a), b)

for any a, b ∈ A,

(2)

(3)

(4)

Moreover, if (2) and (4) hold, then B(b, ac) = B(f (ac), b) = B(f (a)f (c), b) = B(f (a), cb) =
B(cb, a), so (3) holds.
We have that θ is H-colinear if and only if B(b, h∗ · a) = B((h∗S) · b, a) for any a, b ∈ A, h∗ ∈ H ∗,
and θ is bijective if and only if B is non-degenerate, thus (1) ⇔ (2) is clear.

For (1) ⇔ (3), λ and B determine each other by the relations λ(a) = B(1, a) for any a ∈ A,
⊓⊔

respectively B(a, b) = λ(ba) for any a, b ∈ A.

Example 2.3 1) If H = kG, the group Hopf algebra of a group G, then S2 = Id, so H is
cosovereign with ε as a sovereign character. A right H-comodule algebra is just a G-graded
algebra A, and A is (H, ε)-symmetric if and only if A is graded symmetric in the sense of [6,
Section 5].
2) More generally, if H is an involutory Hopf algebra, i.e. S2 = Id, then H is obviously
cosovereign with ε as a sovereign character. In this case, if A is a ﬁnite dimensional algebra in
MH, then A∗ ∈ AMH
A , so F (A∗) is just A∗, with the usual left and right A-actions. Thus A is
(H, ε)-symmetric if and only if A∗ ≃ A in AMH
A .

Remark 2.4 The deﬁnition of symmetry depends on the cosovereign character. Thus it is
possible that a cosovereign Hopf algebra H has two sovereign characters u and v, and a right
H-comodule algebra A is (H, u)-symmetric, but not (H, v)-symmetric. Indeed, let H = kC2,
where C2 = {e, g} is a group of order 2 (e is the neutral element), and the characteristic of k
is 6= 2. Let A be a commutative C2-graded division algebra with support C2; for example one
can take A = kC2. Then H is involutory, so it is a cosovereign Hopf algebra with two possible
sovereign characters ε = pe + pg and u = pe − pg, where {pe, pg} is the basis of H ∗ dual to the
basis {e, g} of H. We have u2 = ε, so u−1 = u.

4

It is easy to see that A is (H, ε)-symmetric, i.e. graded symmetric in the terminology of [6], for
example by using the results of [7], where the question whether any graded division algebra is
graded symmetric is addressed.
On the other hand, A is not (H, u)-symmetric. Indeed, let λ : A → k be a linear map such
that λ(ab) = λ(b(u · a)) for any a, b ∈ A. We have u · a = a for any a ∈ Ae (the homogeneous
component of degree e of A), and u · a = −a for any a ∈ Ag. Then for b = 1 and a ∈ Ag we get
λ(a) = 0, thus λ(Ag) = 0. Also, for a, b ∈ Ag we obtain λ(ab) = 0, and since AgAg = Ae, this
shows that λ(Ae) = 0. Thus λ must be zero.

Remark 2.5 It is obvious that a graded symmetric algebra is symmetric as a k-algebra. More
general, if H is involutory, then a (H, ε)-symmetric algebra is symmetric as a k-algebra. How-
ever, for an arbitrary cosovereign Hopf algebra H with sovereign character u, if A is (H, u)-
symmetric, then A is not necessarily symmetric as a k-algebra, as we show in the following
example.

Let H = H4, the 4-dimensional Sweedler’s Hopf algebra. It is presented by algebra generators

c and x, subject to relations

c2 = 1, x2 = 0, xc = −cx

The coalgebra structure is deﬁned by

∆(c) = c ⊗ c, ∆(x) = c ⊗ x + x ⊗ 1, ε(c) = 1, ε(x) = 0.

The antipode S satisﬁes S(c) = c, S(x) = −cx, thus S2(x) = −x. Apart from ε, H has just

one more character α, given by α(c) = −1, α(x) = 0; it acts on the basis elements of H by

α · 1 = 1, α · c = −c, α · x = x, α · (cx) = −cx

(5)

H is cosovereign, and the only sovereign character is α. We show that the linear map
λ : H → k, λ(1) = λ(c) = λ(cx) = 0, λ(x) = 1 makes H an (H, α)-symmetric algebra. Indeed,
we ﬁrst see by a straightforward checking that λ is right H-colinear (or equivalently, left H ∗-
linear). Next, an easy computation using (5) shows that any element of the form ba − a(α · b)
lies in the span of 1, c and cx, thus λ(ba) = λ(a(α · b)) for any a, b ∈ H.

Finally, let I be a left ideal of H contained in Kerλ. Let z = δ1 + βc + γcx ∈ I, where
δ, β, γ ∈ k. Then cz = δc + β1 + γx ∈ I ⊆< 1, c, cx >, so γ = 0. Then xz = δx − βcx ∈ I ⊆<
1, c, cx >, so δ = 0. Now cxz = −βx ∈ I ⊆< 1, c, cx >, so β must be zero, too. Thus z = 0,
and H is (H, α)-symmetric. This will also follow from Proposition 4.4.

On the other hand, H is not symmetric as a k-algebra. Indeed, if λ : H → k is a linear
map such that λ(ab) = λ(ba) for any a, b ∈ H, then λ(cx) = λ(xc) = −λ(cx), so λ(cx) = 0,
and λ(x) = λ(ccx) = λ(cxc) = −λ(x), so λ(x) = 0. Thus the two-sided ideal < x, cx > of H
is contained in Kerλ, showing that H is not symmetric. This can also be seen from a general
result saying that a Hopf algebra is symmetric as an algebra if and only if it is unimodular (i.e.
the spaces of left integrals and right integrals in H coincide) and S2 is inner, see [17]; for H4
the square of the antipode is inner, but the unimodularity condition fails.

Now we explain how examples of (H, u)-symmetric algebras in the category MH can be
constructed, where H is a cosovereign Hopf algebra with sovereign character u. We recall that
for any algebra A (in the category of vector spaces), and any left A, right A-bimodule M ,
one can construct an algebra structure on the space A ⊕ M with the multiplication deﬁned by
(a, m)(a′, m′) = (aa′, am′ + ma′); this is called the trivial extension of A and M . The unit of
this algebra is (1, 0). If M = A∗ with the usual A, A-bimodule structure, the trivial extension
of A and A∗ is simply called the trivial extension of A, and it is a symmetric algebra, see [14,
Example 16.60].

5

Proposition 2.6 Let A be a right H-comodule algebra, where H is cosovereign with sovereign
character u. Then E(A) = A ⊕ F (A∗), with the direct sum structure of a right H-comodule, and
the algebra structure obtained by the trivial extension of A and the A, A-bimodule F (A∗), is a
right H-comodule algebra which is (H, u)-symmetric.

Proof The multiplication of E(A) is given by

(a, a∗)(b, b∗) = (ab, a ∗ b∗ + a∗b) = (ab, (u−1 · a)b∗ + a∗b)

for any a, b ∈ A and any a∗, b∗ ∈ A∗.

We ﬁrst see that E(A) is a right H-comodule algebra. Indeed, the H-coaction on E(A) is

ρ : E(A) → E(A) ⊗ H, given by

ρ(a, a∗) = X(a0, 0) ⊗ a1 + X(0, a∗

0) ⊗ a∗
1

Then

ρ((a, a∗)(b, b∗)) = ρ(ab, a ∗ b∗ + a∗b)

= X((ab)0, 0) ⊗ (ab)1 + X(0, (a ∗ b∗)0) ⊗ (a ∗ b∗)1 + X(0, (a∗b)0) ⊗ (a∗b)1
= X(a0b0, 0) ⊗ a1b1 + X(0, a0 ∗ b∗
0) ⊗ a∗
= (X(a0, 0) ⊗ a1 + X(0, a∗
= ρ(a, a∗)ρ(b, b∗)

0) ⊗ a1b∗
1)(X(b0, 0) ⊗ b1 + X(0, b∗

0) ⊗ b∗
1)

1 + X(0, a∗

0b0) ⊗ a∗

1b1

Let λ : E(A) → k be the linear map deﬁned by λ(a, a∗) = a∗(1) for any a ∈ A, a∗ ∈ A∗.

Then

Now

λ(h∗ · (a, a∗)) = (h∗ · a∗)(1)

(by (1))

= a∗((h∗S) · 1)
= a∗((h∗S)(1)1)
= h∗(1)a∗(1)
= h∗(1)λ(a, a∗)

λ((a, a∗)(u−1 · (b, b∗))) = λ((a, a∗)(u−1 · b, u−1 · b∗))

= λ(a(u−1 · b), (u−1 · a)(u−1 · b∗) + a∗(u−1 · b))
= (u−1 · b∗)(u−1 · a) + a∗(u−1 · b)
= b∗((u−1S) · (u−1 · a)) + a∗(u−1 · b)
= b∗(u · (u−1 · a)) + a∗(u−1 · b)
= b∗(a) + a∗(u−1 · b)
= λ(ba, (u−1 · b)a∗ + b∗a)
= λ((b, b∗)(a, a∗))

(by (1))

Finally, we see that Kerλ does not contain non-zero right ideals. Indeed, if λ((a, a∗)E(A)) =
0, then b∗(u−1 · a) + a∗(b) = 0 for any b ∈ A, b∗ ∈ A∗. If we take b∗ = 0, we get that a∗(b) = 0
for any b, so a∗ = 0. Then b∗(u−1 · a) = 0 for any b∗, so u−1 · a = 0, showing that a = 0.

We conclude that λ makes E(A) an (H, u)-symmetric algebra.

⊓⊔

We note that the previous result shows that any ﬁnite dimensional algebra in the category
MH, where H is cosovereign via u, is a subalgebra of an (H, u)-symmetric algebra, and also a
quotient of an (H, u)-symmetric algebra. The construction in Proposition 2.6 helps us to provide
more examples of algebras that are symmetric in categories of corepresentations with respect to
certain characters, but which are not symmetric as k-algebras.

Example 2.7 Assume that k has characteristic 6= 2, and let H = H4 be Sweedler’s Hopf algebra.
Let A = k[X]/(X 2), a 2-dimensional algebra, with basis {1, X}, and relation X 2 = 0. Let c and
x be the endomorphisms of the space A such that c(1) = 1, c(X) = −X, x(1) = 0, x(X) = 1.
Then c2 = Id, x2 = 0 and xc = −cx. Moreover, c is an algebra automorphism of A, and it is
easy to check that x(ab) = c(a)x(b) + x(a)b for any a, b ∈ A, thus A is a left H-module algebra
with the actions of c and x given by the endomorphisms above, i.e.

c · 1 = 1, c · X = −X, x · 1 = 0, x · X = 1.

The dual space A∗ has a left H-action given by (h · a∗)(a) = a∗(S(h) · a) for any h ∈ H, a∗ ∈ A∗
and a ∈ A. If we consider the basis {p1, pX } of A∗ dual to the basis {1, X}, this action explicitly
writes

c · p1 = p1, c · pX = −pX, x · p1 = −pX, x · pX = 0.

On the other hand, A∗ has usual left A-module structure given by

1p1 = p1, 1pX = pX, Xp1 = 0, XpX = p1,

and usual right A-module structure given by

p11 = p1, pX1 = pX, p1X = 0, pXX = p1.

A is also a right comodule algebra over the dual Hopf algebra H ∗. Since H ∗ is cosovereign with
sovereign character c (via the isomorphism H ≃ H ∗∗), the associated left A-module structure on
F (A∗) is given by a ∗ a∗ = (c · a)a∗ for any a ∈ A, a∗ ∈ A∗. Thus

1 ∗ p1 = p1, 1 ∗ pX = pX, X ∗ p1 = 0, X ∗ pX = −p1

The we can consider the algebra E(A) = A ⊕ F (A∗), whose basis is {1, X, p1, pX}, and multipli-
cation induced by

X 2 = p2

1 = p2

X = p1pX = pXp1 = 0

X ∗ p1 = 0, X ∗ pX = −p1, p1X = 0, pXX = p1

If we denote u = X and v = pX , we can present E(A) by generators u, v, subject to relations
u2 = v2 = 0, vu = −uv. The left H-module structure of E(A) is given by c · u = −u, c · v =
−v, x · u = 1, x · v = 0. If we denote by {P1, Pc, Px, Pcx} the basis of H ∗ dual to the standard
basis {1, c, x, cx} of H, the right H ∗-comodule structure of E(A) is given by

u 7→ u ⊗ P1 + c · u ⊗ Pc + x · u ⊗ Px + (cx) · u ⊗ Pcx

= u ⊗ (P1 − Pc) + 1 ⊗ (Px + Pcx)

v 7→ v ⊗ (P1 − Pc)

Since the Hopf algebra H is selfdual, a Hopf algebra isomorphism being given by 1 7→ P1 + Pc,
c 7→ P1 − Pc, x 7→ Px − Pcx, cx 7→ −Px − Pcx, we can regard A as a right H-comodule algebra.
Summarizing, E(A) is the algebra with generators u, v, relations

u2 = v2 = 0, vu = −uv

7

and H-comodule structure given by

u 7→ u ⊗ c − 1 ⊗ cx, v 7→ v ⊗ c

By Proposition 2.6, E(A) is (H, α)-symmetric, where α = P1 − Pc is the distinguished grouplike
element of H ∗.
On the other hand, E(A) is not symmetric as a k-algebra. Indeed, if λ : E(A) → k is a linear map
such that λ(zz′) = λ(z′z) for any z, z′ ∈ E(A), then λ(uv) = λ(vu) = −λ(uv), thus λ(uv) = 0.
But the 1-dimensional space spanned by uv is a two-sided ideal of E(A), so Kerλ contains a
non-zero ideal.

3 Frobenius smash products

Let A be an algebra in MH, where H is a ﬁnite dimensional Hopf algebra. Then A is a left
H ∗-module algebra and we can consider the smash product A#H ∗, which is an algebra with
multiplication given by

(a#h∗)(b#g∗) = X a(h∗

1 · b)#h∗

2g∗

It is known that A is a Frobenius algebra if and only if so is A#H ∗, see [4].

On the other hand, A#H ∗ is an algebra in the category MH ∗ , with the H ∗-coaction induced
by the comultiplication of H ∗, i.e. a#h∗ 7→ P a#h∗
2. The aim of this section is to discuss
the connection between A being a Frobenius algebra in MH , and A#H ∗ being a Frobenius
algebra in MH ∗ .

1 ⊗ h∗

We consider the usual left and right actions of H ∗ on H, h∗ ⇀ h = P h∗(h2)h1 and h ↼
h∗ = P h∗(h1)h2, and the usual left and right actions of H on H ∗, denoted by h ⇀ h∗ and
h∗ ↼ h, where h ∈ H and h∗ ∈ H ∗. H also acts on A#H ∗ by h ⇀ (a#h∗) = a#(h ⇀ h∗).

We recall that a right (respectively left) integral in H is an element t ∈ H such that th = ε(h)t
(respectively ht = ε(h)t) for any h ∈ H, and a left integral on H is an element T ∈ H ∗ such
that h∗T = h∗(1)T for any h∗ ∈ H ∗.

Theorem 3.1 Let H be a ﬁnite dimensional Hopf algebra, and let A be a ﬁnite dimensional
right H-comodule algebra which is a Frobenius algebra in the category MH. Then the smash
product A#H ∗ is a Frobenius algebra in the category MH ∗.

Proof Let λ : A → k be a linear map whose kernel does not contain non-zero right ideals of
A, and such that λ(h∗ · a) = h∗(1)λ(a) for any h∗ ∈ H ∗ and a ∈ A. Let t be a non-zero right
integral in H. Deﬁne a linear map λ : A#H ∗ → k such that

λ(a#h∗) = λ(a)h∗(t) for any a ∈ A, h∗ ∈ H ∗

We have that λ(h · z) = ε(h)λ(z) for any h ∈ H and z ∈ A#H ∗. Indeed

λ(h · (a#h∗)) = X λ(a#h∗

= λ(a)h∗(th)
= λ(a)ε(h)h∗(t)
= ε(h)λ(a#h∗)

We show that Ker(λ) does not contain non-zero subobjects of A#H ∗ in the category
A#H ∗. Let I be a right ideal of A#H ∗ which is also a right H ∗-subcomodule (or equiva-
MH ∗
lently, invariant with respect to the induced left H-action on A#H ∗) such that I ⊂ Ker(λ).

J ⊗A (A#H ∗) → I, m ⊗ z 7→ mz

is an isomorphism in the category MH ∗
J#H ∗. Since λ(I) = 0, we see that λ(J) = 0, so J = 0. We conclude that I must be zero.

A#H ∗, see [8, Theorem 6.4.4]. In particular I = (J#1)(A#H ∗) =

⊓⊔

Corollary 3.2 A ﬁnite dimensional Hopf algebra H is Frobenius in the category MH.

Proof k is a right H ∗-comodule algebra in a trivial way, and it is clear that k is Frobenius in
. Since H ∗∗ ≃ H as Hopf
MH ∗
algebras, we see that H is Frobenius in MH.
⊓⊔

. By Theorem 3.1 we get that k#H ∗∗ is Frobenius in MH ∗∗

The following example shows that the converse of Theorem 3.1 is not true.

Example 3.3 Let A = A0 ⊕ A1 be a superalgebra, i.e. a C2-graded algebra, which is Frobenius
as an algebra, but not graded Frobenius (i.e. it is not a Frobenius algebra in the category MkC2
of supervector spaces). In this example we use the additive notation for the operation of C2.
Examples of such A are given in [6, Section 6]; the trivial extension associated to a ﬁnite
dimensional algebra is one such example. Let µ : A → k be a linear map whose kernel does not
contain non-zero left ideals of A. We deﬁne

λ : A#(kC2)∗ → k, λ(a#px) = µ(a)

for any a ∈ A, x ∈ C2

Then λ(y ⇀ (a#px)) = λ(a#px−y) = µ(a) = ε(y)λ(a#px).

On the other hand, Kerλ does not contain non-zero left ideals of A#(kC2)∗. Indeed, assume
that λ((A#(kC2)∗)z) = 0, where z = a#p0 + b#p1. Since (c#p0)z = ca0#p0 + cb1#p1, we
have 0 = µ(ca0) + µ(cb1) = µ(c(a0 + b1)) for any c ∈ A. Thus µ(A(a0 + b1)) = 0, showing that
a0 + b1 = 0, and then a0 = b1 = 0. Similarly, since (c#p1)z = ca1#p0 + cb0#p1, we obtain
a1 = b0 = 0. Thus z = 0. We conclude that λ makes A#(kC2)∗ a Frobenius algebra in the
category M(kC2)∗ .

4 Symmetric smash products

The following shows that the good connection between a ﬁnite dimensional right H-comodule
algebra A and the smash product A#H ∗ being Frobenius does not work anymore for the sym-
metric property.

Example 4.1 Let C2 =< c >= {e, g} be the cyclic group of order 2, and let A be a C2-graded
algebra which is symmetric and such that the homogeneous component Ae is not symmetric. For
example one can take the trivial extension A = R ⊕ R∗ of a non-symmetric algebra R, with the
grading Ae = R, Ag = R∗. Then A is a right kC2-comodule algebra, so we can consider the
smash product A#(kC2)∗. Denote by {pe, pg} the basis of (kC2)∗ dual to the basis {e, g} of kC2.
Then 1#pe is an idempotent in A#(kC2)∗ and it is easy to check that

(1#pe)(A#(kC2)∗)(1#pe) = Ae#pe ≃ Ae = R

Then (1#pe)(A#(kC2)∗)(1#pe) is not a symmetric algebra, so neither is A#(kC2)∗ by [14,
Exercise 16.25].

In this section we discuss the connection between A being a symmetric algebra in MH with
with respect to

respect to some character of H, and A#H ∗ being a symmetric algebra in MH ∗
some character of H ∗ (i.e. a grouplike element of H).

Let H be a ﬁnite dimensional Hopf algebra. Then there exists a character α ∈ H ∗ such that
th = α(h)t for any left integral t in H and any h ∈ H; α is called the distinguished grouplike
element of H ∗, and it also satisﬁes ht′ = α−1(h)t′ for any right integral t′ in H and any h ∈ H,
see [18, Section 10.5] or [8, Section 5.5].

Similarly, there exists a distinguished grouplike element g of H, such that T h∗ = h∗(g)T for
any left integral T on H and any h∗ ∈ H ∗. We note that in [18], g−1 is called the distinguished
grouplike element of H; we prefer the way we deﬁned because g will play the same role for H
as α does for H ∗. It is showed in [18, Theorem 10.5.4] that for any left integral t in H

Applying this for H ∗ we see that for any left integral T on H one has

∆(t) = X S2(t2)g−1 ⊗ t1

∆(T ) = X(T2S2)α−1 ⊗ T1

and then for any h ∈ H

T ↼ h = X T1(h)T2

= ((T2S2)α−1)(h)T1
= X T2(S2(h1))α−1(h2)T1
= X α−1(h2)(S2(h1) ⇀ T )

Thus for any left integral T on H and any h ∈ H

T ↼ h = X α−1(h2)(S2(h1) ⇀ T )

Now if t is a left integral in H, then S(t) is a right integral in H and

∆(S(t)) = X S(t2) ⊗ S(t1)

= X S(t1) ⊗ S(S2(t2)g−1)
= X S(t1) ⊗ gS2(S(t2))
= S(t)2 ⊗ gS2(S(t)1)

( by (6))

We conclude that for any right integral t in H

∆(t) = X t2 ⊗ gS2(t1)

We also see that for a right integral t in H and h ∈ H

X t1 ⊗ ht2 = X ε(h1)t1 ⊗ h2t2

= X S(h1)h2t1 ⊗ h3t2
= X S(h1)(h2t)1 ⊗ (h2t)2
= X α−1(h2)S(h1)t1 ⊗ t2

Thus we showed that

Theorem 4.2 Let H be a ﬁnite dimensional Hopf algebra, and let g and α be the distinguished
grouplike elements of H and H ∗. We assume that S2(h) = g−1hg = P α−1(h1)α(h3)h2 for
any h ∈ H. Then a right H-comodule algebra A is (H, α)-symmetric if and only if A#H ∗ is
(H ∗, g)-symmetric.

Proof We note that

for any h ∈ H.

S−2(h) = X α(h1)α−1(h3)h2

(11)

Assume that A is (H, α)-symmetric, and let λ : A → k such that λ(ba) = λ(a(α−1 · b)) =
λ(aα−1(b1)b0), λ(h∗ · a) = h∗(1)λ(a) for any a, b ∈ A, h∗ ∈ H ∗, and also Ker λ does not contain
a non-zero right ideal of A. Let t be a non-zero right integral in H and deﬁne

λ : A#H ∗ → k, λ(a#h∗) = λ(a)h∗(t)

as in the proof of Theorem 3.1. This makes A#H ∗ a Frobenius algebra in the category MH ∗. In
order to see that A#H ∗ is symmetric in MH ∗
, it remains to show that λ(zz′) = λ(z′(g−1 ⇀ z))
for any z, z′ ∈ A#H ∗, where g−1 ⇀ (a#h∗) = a#(g−1 ⇀ h∗). Indeed, we see that

Conversely, assume that A#H ∗ is (H ∗, g)-symmetric, and let µ : A#H ∗ → k be a linear map
whose kernel does not contain non-zero right ideals of A#H ∗, and such that µ(h ⇀ z) = ε(h)µ(z)

11

and µ(zz′) = µ(z′(g−1 ⇀ z)) for any h ∈ H and any z, z′ ∈ A#H ∗. Let T be a left integral on
H and deﬁne

˜µ : A → k, ˜µ(a) = µ(a#T ).

Let a ∈ A and h∗ ∈ H ∗. We note that g ⇀ T is a right integral on H, see [8, Proposition

5.5.4]. Let z = a#(g ⇀ T ) and z′ = 1#h∗. Then

zz′ − z′(g−1 ⇀ z) = (a#(g ⇀ T ))(1#h∗) − (1#h∗)(a#T )

= a#(g ⇀ T )h∗ − X(h∗
= a#h∗(1)(g ⇀ T ) − X(h∗
= h∗(1)a#(g ⇀ T ) − (h∗ · a)#T

1 · a)#h∗
2T
1 · a)#h∗

2(1)T

Since µ(zz′) = µ(z′(g−1 ⇀ z)), we get

˜µ(h∗ · a) = µ((h∗ · a)#T )

= h∗(1)µ(a#(g ⇀ T ))
= h∗(1)ε(g)µ(a#T )
= h∗(1)˜µ(a)

If I is a subobject of A in AMH contained in Ker˜µ, then µ(I#T ) = 0. But I#T is a left

ideal of A#H ∗, so it must be zero. Then I must be zero, too.

To show that A is symmetric in MH it only remains to check that ˜µ(ba) = ˜µ(a(α−1 · b)) for

any a, b ∈ A. This holds true since

˜µ(ba) = µ(ba#T )

= µ((b#ε)(a#T ))
= µ((a#T )(g−1 ⇀ (b#ε)))
= µ((a#T )(b#(g−1 ⇀ ε)))

Remark 4.3 (1) The conditions on H in Theorem 4.2 are satisﬁed if H is involutory and
unimodular, and H ∗ is unimodular. Indeed, in this case the distinguished grouplike elements are
trivial, i.e. α = ε and g = 1.
For example, this happens if H = kG, where G is a ﬁnite group. Thus a ﬁnite dimensional

⊓⊔

with respect to 1.

G-graded algebra is graded symmetric if and only if the smash product A#(kG)∗ is symmetric
in M(kG)∗
(2) In the case where the characteristic of k is 0, it is known that H is involutory if and only if H
is semisimple, if and only if H is cosemisimple, see [18, Theorem 16.1.2], and in this situation
H and H ∗ are always unimodular. Thus Theorem 4.2 applies to any semisimple Hopf algebra
in characteristic 0.
(3) If k has positive characteristic, Theorem 4.2 applies to any semisimple cosemisimple Hopf
algebra H. Indeed, it is known that any such H is involutory, see [9, Theorem 3.1].
(4) A Hopf algebra satisfying the conditions of Theorem 4.2 is not necessarily involutory, and it
may be not unimodular; take for example Sweedler’s 4-dimensional Hopf algebra.

As a consequence of Theorem 4.2 we obtain that if a Hopf algebra H is cosovereign by
In fact, we can prove that H is

α and H ∗ is cosovereign by g, then H is (H, α)-symmetric.
(H, α)-symmetric with less assumptions.

Proposition 4.4 Let H be a ﬁnite dimensional Hopf algebra which is cosovereign with sovereign
element α, the distinguished grouplike element of H ∗. Then H is (H, α)-symmetric.

Proof In order to use the notation we have already developed, it is more convenient to show
that if H ∗ is cosovereign by g, then H ∗ is (H ∗, g)-symmetric. If t is a right integral in H, by the
proof of Theorem 3.1 (when we take A = k and identify A#H ∗ with H ∗) we have that the linear
map λ : H ∗ → k, λ(h∗) = h∗(t) is H-linear, and its kernel does not contain nonzero subobjects
of H ∗ in MH ∗

H ∗ . On the other hand, for any h∗, g∗ ∈ H ∗

λ(g∗(g−1 ⇀ h∗)) = X g∗(t1)h∗(t2g−1)

by (9)

= g∗(t2)h∗(gS2(t1)g−1)
= X h∗(t1)g∗(t2)
= (h∗g∗)(t)
= λ(h∗g∗)

so λ makes H ∗ an (H ∗, g)-symmetric algebra.

⊓⊔

5 Passing to coinvariants

If A is a right H-comodule algebra which is Frobenius (respectively symmetric) as an algebra, it is
a natural question to ask whether this property transfers to the subalgebra of coinvariants AcoH.
It is easy to see that such a transfer does not hold. Indeed, let A be the algebra from Example
4.1, which is symmetric. A is a kC2-comodule algebra, and its subalgebra of coinvariants is
just Ae, which is not even Frobenius. The following shows that a good transfer occurs if A is
Frobenius in the category MH, provided H is cosemisimple.

Proposition 5.1 Let H be a cosemisimple Hopf algebra. If A is a right H-comodule algebra
which is Frobenius in the category MH, then AcoH is a Frobenius algebra. If moreover, H is
involutory and A is (H, ε)-symmetric, then AcoH is symmetric.

Proof Let i : AcoH → A be the inclusion map, and let i∗ : A∗ → (AcoH )∗ be its dual. Since i is
a morphism of AcoH, AcoH- bimodules, then so is i∗. If A is Frobenius in MH, let θ : A → A∗ be
A . We show that i∗θi : AcoH → (AcoH )∗ is an isomorphism
an isomorphism in the category MH

13

of right AcoH-modules, i.e. AcoH is Frobenius. In fact it is enough to show that i∗θi is injective;
since Im θi = (A∗)coH, this is the same with showing that i∗

|(A∗)coH is injective.

The left H ∗-action on A∗ induced by the right H-coaction is (h∗ · a∗)(a) = P h∗S(a1)a∗(a0),
for any A ∈ A. Then a∗ ∈ (A∗)coH if and only if h∗ · a∗ = h∗(1)a∗ for any h∗ ∈ H ∗, and this
means that a∗(P h∗S(a1)a0 − h∗(1)a) = 0 for any a ∈ A and any h∗ ∈ H ∗. Since S is bijective
(H is cosemisimple), we get that a∗ ∈ (A∗)coH if and only if a∗ vanishes on the subspace

V =< h∗(a1)a0 − h∗(1)a | h∗ ∈ H ∗, a ∈ A >

Since

Ker i∗

|(A∗)coH = {a∗ ∈ (A∗)coH | a∗(AcoH) = 0 }

we see that i∗
|(A∗)coH is injective if and only if V + AcoH = A. But this is indeed true, since for a
left integral T on H such that T (1) = 1, one has a = T ·a−(T ·a−T (1)a). Moreover, T ·a ∈ AcoH,
since h∗ · (T · a) = (h∗T ) · a = h∗(1)T a for any h∗ ∈ H ∗, and obviously T · a − T (1)a ∈ V .

For the second part we just have to note that i∗θi is a morphism of AcoH, AcoH-bimodules
since θ is an isomorphism of A, A-bimodules; now the proof of the ﬁrst part works also in this
⊓⊔
case.
