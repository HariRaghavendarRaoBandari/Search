ABSTRACT

2H-TaSe2 has been one of unique transition metal dichalcogenides exhibiting several phase transitions due to a delicate
balance among competing electronic ground states. An unusual metallic state at high-T is sequentially followed by an
incommensurate charge density wave (ICDW) state at ≈ 122 K and a commensurate charge density wave (CCDW) state
at ≈ 90 K, and superconductivity at TC ∼0.14 K. Upon systematic intercalation of Pd ions into TaSe2, we ﬁnd that CCDW
order is destabilized more rapidly than ICDW to indicate a hidden quantum phase transition point at x∼0.09-0.10. Moreover,
TC shows a dramatic enhancement up to 3.3 K at x = 0.08, ∼24 times of TC in 2H-TaSe2, in proportional to the density of
states N(EF ). Investigations of upper critical ﬁelds Hc2 in single crystals reveal evidences of multiband superconductivity as
temperature-dependent anisotropy factor γH = Hab
c2(T ), and an upward, positive-curvature in
Hab
c2 (T ) near TC. Furthermore, analysis of temperature-dependent electronic speciﬁc heat corroborates the presence of multiple
superconducting gaps. Based on above ﬁndings and electronic phase diagram vs x, we propose that the increase of N(EF ) and
effective electron-phonon coupling in the vicinity of CDW quantum phase transition should be a key to the large enhancement
of TC in PdxTaSe2.

Introduction
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have been extensively studied for decades due to their rich electronic properties
resulting from their low dimensionality. These systems have the layered structure and share the formula MX2, where M is a
transition metal atom (M = Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Mo, W and Re), and X is a chalcogen atom (X = S, Se, and Te).1–3 Each
layer consists of a hexagonal transition metal sheet sandwiched by two similar chalcogen sheets and the layers are coupled to
each other by weak van der Waals force. Within the layers, they form strongly bonded, two dimensional X-X layers while
M has either trigonal prismatic or octahedral coordination with X. Many of these compounds exhibit charge-density wave
(CDW) and some of them manifest the competition/coexistence between CDW and superconductivity.1–3 It is common in
many of these compounds that superconductivity emerges in the vicinity of the CDW quantum phase transition induced by
intercalation of variety of elements into the van der Waal gaps4–9 and by the application of pressure10, 11 or gate voltage
to the pristine compound.12 The overall electronic phase diagram as a function of doping, gate voltage or pressure are
thus analogous to those of high-TC cuprates, iron based superconductors and heavy fermion materials, suggesting possible
role of the CDW quantum critical point on the creation of superconductivity. However, exact physical origin for stabiliz-
ing the superconductivity over the CDW state has not been well understood and should be further clariﬁed in each TMDC system.

The 2H-polymorph of tantalum diselenide (TaSe2) is yet another renowned CDW system, in which an unusual metallic
state at high temperatures enters into an incommensurate-charge-density wave (ICDW) phase at TICDW ≈122 K, followed by a
ﬁrst order “lock-in” transition to a commensurate charge density-wave (CCDW) phase at TCCDW ≈ 90 K.13–15 Angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and optical spectroscopy measurements have suggested the presence of pseudogaps
for T > TICDW similar to that observed in high-TC cuprates.16–18 Interestingly, in the temperature region, resistivity is known
to change quite linearly with temperature.17, 18 Upon entering the ICDW phase, these pseudogaps become larger and ﬁnally
evolves into real band-gaps in the CCDW phase. At the same time, two hole-like circular pockets around Γ and K points and
one electron-like ‘dogbone’ centered on M point of the Brillouin zone (BZ)3, 16 show drastic reconstruction at T = TCCDW,
resulting in three times smaller BZ, characterized by doubly degenerate circular pockets and small rounded triangles in the K
and M points of the new BZ, respectively.16 While the origin of the CDW instability in 2H-TMDCs has been a topic of debate
for many years, most recent studies indicate that the CDW formation in 2H-TMDCs is driven by periodic lattice distortion
induced by strong momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling rather than by the Peierls-type mechanism.19–23

Inside the CCDW state, the 2H-TaSe2 exhibits yet another phase transition into a superconductor at TC ∼ 0.14 K. This
superconductivity arises by the conventional electron-phonon coupling. It has been known that chemical substitution of Te for
Se and doping of Mo or W for Ta changed the 2H-TaSe2 into 3R polytypes.24, 25 In this case, an optimal TC is found to be 2.4 K,
of which origin has been attributed to the three-layer stacking sequence of 3R-TaSe2 compared to two-layer stacking sequence
in 2H-TaSe2. Meanwhile, the superconductivity can be further modulated by a speciﬁc doping of Fe or Ni into 2H-TaSe2
within the same 2H-structure.26–28 In this case, only intercalation of Ni was found to show enhancement of TC up to 2.7 K,26
suggesting that not only structural motif but also carrier modulation might be important for superconductivity. Therefore, to
clarify the exact roles of structure and carriers on the delicate balance between the CDW and superconductivity, systematic
doping/intercalation studies in each structural unit become necessary.

In this report, we show that intercalation of Pd ion into 2H-TaSe2 in a broad doping ranges without altering the 2H structure
enhances TC up to 3.3 K, the highest observable TC among the TaSe2 polytypes. With intercalation of Pd, the CCDW phase of
2H-TaSe2 is suppressed more rapidly than the ICDW transition while the TC increases continuously to form a dome-shape
phase diagram and an optimal TC ∼ 3.3 K for x = 0.08-0.09. We ﬁnd that TC(x) increases in proportional to the density of
states estimated from the Sommerfeld coefﬁcient. Measurements of upper critical ﬁelds and speciﬁc heat below TC(x) show
clear evidences of multiple superconducting energy gaps. These observations and comparison with other TMDCs uncover
that the increase of density of states and thus electron-phonon coupling constant, regardless how it is driven by, e.g., structural
modiﬁcation or by carrier doping, could be important for the creation of multiband BCS superconductivity in the vicinity of the
quantum phase transition of the CCDW state.

parameters with Pd content (x). Standard deviations of the cell parameters are smaller than the points.

Powder x-ray diffraction patterns of the PdxTaSe2 samples in Fig.1 indicate that all the peaks can be indexed with the
structure of 2H-TaSe2. Hence, the process of Pd intercalation does not change the structure of the mother compound. The
reﬁnement of the diffraction pattern was used to extract lattice parameters (a and c) at room temperature, as summarized in
Fig.1(b, c). Intercalation of atoms into the van der Waal gaps usually leads to expansion of a unit cell. With increasing Pd
content, both a- and c-values increase systematically with x. The observed trend is similar to that observed in 1T -CuxTiSe2,4
1T -PdxTiSe2,6 and 2H-CuxTaS2.5 The a- (c-) value of PdSe2 is larger (smaller) than that of 2H-TaSe2.29 Hence, if Pd ions are
partly substituting Ta ions, TaSe2 would have exhibited the increase of a and decrease of c, which is in contrast to our results.
Thus, the substitution of Pd for Ta doesn’t seem to happen, presumably due to a smaller ion size of Pd (rPd+1 = 59 pm) than Ta
(rTa+4 = 68 pm). All this information supports that Pd ions are mostly intercalated into the layers with the van-der-Waals bonding.

a PdxTaSe2 single crystal up to 460 K, with Tc ∼ 3.2 K. Bottom: The dρab/dT curve exhibiting almost constant behavior
demonstrates the T -linear dependence of resistivity at high temperatures at least up to 460 K.

In general, near the CDW transition temperature, resistivity and magnetic susceptibility curves exhibit an anomaly due
to the opening of a partial or full gap at the Fermi energy (EF), which is often accompanied by the simultaneous decrease of
the Fermi surface area and the variation of density of states N(EF). Hence, the evolution of CDW states with x, can be traced
from the temperature-dependent resistivity and susceptibility measurements. Figure 2(a) presents the resistivity normalized
by the value at 300 K (ρ/ρ300K). The undoped 2H-TaSe2, ρ(T ) shows the metallic behavior near room temperature to low
temperatures till it exhibits a hump near 115 K due to the formation of ICDW-state, being consistent with the former studies.1, 17
Below this transition, resistivity steeply decreases further to exhibit more metallic behavior. The two CDW transitions can be
indeed identiﬁed from the dρ/dT curve, developing a minima near TICCDW ≈ 120 K and a maxima near TICCDW ≈ 90 K. The
transition temperatures thus estimated are in good agreement with those obtained from neutron diffraction studies.13–15

With increase of Pd content, the residual resistivity ratio (RRR) of PdxTaSe2 compounds decreases systematically compared
to the undoped compound, indicating that the compounds thus evolve into a bad metal. Meanwhile, ρ300K of all the samples
was located around 0.2-0.6 mΩ cm without showing systematic trend, due to the polycrystalline nature of the samples. With
increase of x, the anomalies in dρ/dT (Fig.2(b)) becomes broadened. Yet, the minima of dρ/dT curve could be identiﬁed up
to x=0.10 and the maxima of dρ/dT curve up to x=0.07, allowing the determination of TICCDW and TCCDW. It is also clear from
the dρ/dT curve in Fig.2(b) that the maximum points indicating TCCDW decreases more rapidly with x while the minima points
for TICDW decreases slightly. These behavior is summarized later in the electronic phase diagram. For all x, ρ(T ) below 30 K
follows a power law behavior (T α) with α ≈ 2, being consistent with the Fermi liquid behavior. On the other hand, roughly
above 140 K (i,e at T > TICDW), where a pseudogap behavior was found in the mother compound,17, 18 it is interesting to note
that ρ increases quite linearly with temperature as evidenced from the almost constant behavior in the dρ/dT curve (Fig.2(b)).
To further corroborates the intrinsic nature of this phenomenon, we have measured the in-plane resistivity, ρab, of a PdxTaSe2
single crystals (TC ∼ 3.2 K) up to 460 K as shown in Fig.2(c). The ρab curve indeed shows the linear T -dependence at least up
to 460 K as evidenced by almost constant behavior of the dρab/dT curve. Note that the measurement was performed under Ar
atmosphere to avoid the oxidation of sample while the transport data became unstable above 460 K, possibly due to unknown
changes in the sample. The broad T -range of observing linear T -dependence (from ≈140 K to ≈460 K) is reminiscent of that
observed in high TC cuprates. Moreover, the phenomenon itself that 2H-TaSe2 develops the pseudo-gap above TICCDW seems
also similar to those observed in the high TC cuprates.17, 18 In conventional metals, the linear increase of ρ(T ) can be realized
in a temperature window above the Debye temperature due to the electron-phonon scattering, according to the Bloch-Gr¨uneisen
theory.30 However, once the mean free path l at high temperatures reaches the interatomic spacing a, the resistivity should
start to show saturation. This crossover resistivity is known as the Ioffe-Regel (IR) limit.31–33 In a quasi 2D materials with
cylindrical Fermi surface, ρ should saturate at ρ2D
IR = 2π ¯hd/e2kFl, where d is interlayer spacing, kF is Fermi wave vector.33
Taking d = 6.73 ˚A, half of the c-value, and l (cid:39) a for the PdxTaSe2 crystal, ρ2D
IR = 699 µΩ cm. It is obvious from Fig.2(c) that

transition temperatures have been determined. The arrows mark the TICDW for the undoped and x = 0.09 (inset) samples.

ρab continues to increase linearly at least up to 460 K clearly above 390 K where it should have saturated according to the
IR limit. Thus, the linear increase of ρab curve cannot be simply understood by the conventional electron-phonon scattering
scenario. Even in high TC cuprates, the IR criterion is also violated and ρab continues to increases linearly as high as 1100 K as
a result of strong electronic correlation effect.33 Therefore, the origin of the linear resistivity in the PdxTaSe2 single crystal
could be worth being further explored, related with the similar conundrum existing in high TC cuprates.

Figure 3 shows dc magnetic susceptibility (χ) of PdxTaSe2 samples in the normal-state for different x. A drop in the (χ)
curve of pure 2H-TaSe2 is seen at TICCDW ≈ 120 K, in agreement with the resistivity data. TICDW could be also determined
from the onset of the susceptibility drops as shown in the ﬁg. 3. A Curie-Weiss-like tail also appears in the low temperature,
possibly due to a small local moment induced by Pd intercalation. Appearance of a similar Curie-Weiss-like tail has also been
observed in the Cu and Pd intercalated system.4, 6 The sharpness of the drop decreases with increasing amount of Pd, and TICDW
transition decreases to 107 K for x = 0.10. Due to the Curie-Weiss increase at low temperatures, the ICDW transition could not
be identiﬁed in the χ(T ) for x >0.10.

We found that as the CCDW state is suppressed with increasing Pd content, the superconducting transition temperature
increases continuously. This behavior is illustrated in the low-temperature ρ(T ) and zero ﬁeld cooled χ(T ) data as shown
in Fig.4. For all x, the superconducting transition are clearly observed in resistivity while the onset of diamagnetic behavior
is also observed in χ(T ). With a small amount of Pd (x = 0.03), TC is enhanced more than 17 times than that of the pure
compound. With further increase of Pd content, TC increases systematically and attains a maximum of about 3.3 K for x =
0.09 and then decreases to 2.83 K for x = 0.14. For x ≤0.05, the width of superconducting transition in ρ becomes broadened
compared to the higher doping samples, possibly because the superconducting volume fraction (-4πχ) is less than 10% at 1.8
K (Fig.4(a,b)). For x ≥ 0.06, the value of -4πχ at 1.8 K increases signiﬁcantly and reaches to 120%, indicating the presence
of bulk superconductivity. The shielding fraction larger than 100% is likely to come from the demagnetization factor of the
specimen. For x > 0.09, -4πχ decreases again with increase of x to reach 77% for x =0.14.

Upper critical ﬁelds
For better understanding of the superconducting states, we have measured the temperature-dependence and anisotropy of the
upper critical ﬁelds, Hc2, of a PdxTaSe2 single crystal in a dilution refrigerator. Figure 5(a) and (b) show the T -dependence
of the zero-ﬁeld ρ and dc magnetization at H = 10 Oe of the same PdxTaSe2 single crystal used for Hc2 measurements. In
Fig. 5(c) and (d), we have plotted the magnetic ﬁeld dependence of ρab with H applied parallel and perpendicular to the

ab-plane. It is clear that for H (cid:107) ab, the resistive curve shifts parallel down towards the low temperature with increase of H. For
H (cid:107) c, the resistive transition broadens signiﬁcantly and superconductivity is completely suppressed below 4 T. Figure 5(e)
summarizes the temperature-dependence of estimated Hc2 for both ﬁeld directions, i.e. Hab
c2, determined by the criterion
of the 50% of normal state resistivity. It is noteworthy that Hc
c2 increases linearly down to the lowest measured temperature
without any sign of saturation. This is in sharp contrast to what is seen in isotropic, single-band BCS superconductors in which
Hc2(T ) follows a linear dependence for temperatures close to TC, followed by a saturation, or a concave downward curvature at
low temperature. Such linear temperature-dependence has been observed in the Fe-based superconductors34 and quasi-one
dimensional superconductors,35, 36 indicating the multi-band effects.

factor γH = Hab
c2 (T ) curve exhibits a positive curvature close to TC and then increases linearly with decreasing
temperature. A positive curvature in the Hc2(T ) curve has been often observed in numerous multi-gap superconductors such as
37–40 when their various FSs have different electron-phonon coupling parameters and Fermi
YNi2B2C, MgB2, NbSe2 and NbS2
velocities. The γH (T ), shown in Fig 5(f), also supports the multiband effects. For T close to TC, γH ∼ 1.96, and it increases
with decreasing temperature down to 2 K before it becomes saturated. This is quite similar to that observed in MgB2,41 which
could be understood as an interplay between two major gaps with temperature; the gap in a cylindrical σ band dominates
low-T behavior of Hc2, leading to a large anisotropy, while at T (cid:39) Tc, the gap in the π bands play more important role, strongly
reducing the anisotropy.

In order to have more quantitative understanding, we have analyzed the data using the two-band model for Hc2, which takes
into account the orbital and Zeeman pair breaking effect in the dirty limit.41 Assuming negligible interband scattering, the
equation of Hc2(T ) can be written as

a0[lnt +U(h/t)][lnt +U(ηh/t)] + a2[lnt +U(ηh/t)] + a1[lnt +U(h/t)] = 0,

(1)
where a0 = 2(λ11λ22−λ12λ21), a1 = 1+(λ11−λ22)/λ0, a2 = 1-(λ11−λ22)/λ0, λ0 = [(λ11−λ22)2 +4λ12λ21]1/2, h = Hc2D1/2φ0T
, t = T /Tc, η = D2/D1, and U(x) = Ψ(x + 1/2)− Ψ(x). Ψ(x) is the digamma function, λ11 and λ22 are the intraband BCS
coupling constants, while λ12 and λ21 are the interband BCS coupling constants, and D1 and D2 are the in-plane diffusivity of
each band.

As shown in Fig. 5(e), the experimental data can be well described within the framework of the two-band model. For
Hab
c2 (T ), the best ﬁt parameters are λ11 = λ22 = 0.8, λ12 = λ21 = 0.11, D1 = 0.29 and η = 5, and for the Hc
c2(T ), λ11 = λ22 = 0.5,
λ12 = λ21 = 0.45, D1 = 2.97 and η = 0.142. The obtained ﬁtting parameters suggests that the intraband coupling is much

Heat capacity
To obtain further information on the electronic and superconducting properties, we have measured the speciﬁc heat Cp. Figure
6(a) displays Cp/T vs T 2 curves for selected samples of x = 0.0, 0.03, 0.09, and 0.14. The data for x = 0.09 and 0.14 exhibit
clear peaks near TC, supporting the bulk nature of superconductivity. The normal state speciﬁc heat at temperatures between TC
and 10 K are well described by the relation Cp = γnT + β T 3, where γnT and β T 3 term describes the Sommerfeld coefﬁcient
and phononic contribution, respectively. The electronic contribution for x = 0.09 was obtained by subtracting the phonon and
Schottky contributions from the measured Cp data. In order to extract the Schottky contribution below 0.4 K, we employed a
two level energy scheme. Inset of Fig. 6(a) shows the resultant, normalized electronic speciﬁc heat Cel/γnT as function of
reduced temperature t = T /Tc for x = 0.09. It is found that Cel/γnT displays a hump-like feature around t = 0.2, which supports
the presence of multiple superconducting gaps.

We thus analyzed the Cp data using the BCS α-model, which was originally proposed to explain thermodynamic properties
of a strongly coupled, single-gap superconductor under a semi-empirical approach.42 However, later this model had been
generalized to explain the multigap superconductors such as MgB2.43 In case of the two gaps, speciﬁc heat is determined from
the two contributions, i.e. α1 [=∆1(0)/kBTc] and α2 [=∆2(0)/kBTc] with their relative weight γ1/γn and γ2/γn where γ1 +γ2 = γn
and ∆(0) is the gap value at zero temperature. As evident from the inset of Fig. 6(a), the calculation for one-band α-model with
α = 1.76 deviates signiﬁcantly from the experimental data below t ≈0.5. We then calculated Cel/γnT , introducing two gaps and
their appropriate weights. Values α1 = 1.9 (γ1/γn = 0.7) and α2 = 0.65 (γ2/γn = 0.3), produced the closest matching with our
experimental data. The inset of Fig.6(a) also shows the Cel/γnT vs t plot for an individual α with its weights. The estimated
gap values also support the analysis of upper critical ﬁelds, thereby conﬁrming the existence of at least two gaps with different
magnitudes.

By ﬁtting the data at the normal state between TC and 10 K, we have evaluated the Sommerfeld coefﬁcient γn and the
phonon speciﬁc heat coefﬁcient β , of which variations with x are summarized in the Fig.6(b) and (c). It is surprising to ﬁnd
that γn systematically increases by more than 80 % until it reaches a maximum at x = 0.09, and then decreases with further
increase of x. Note that the evolution of γn with x is qualitatively similar to that of TC with x. On the other hand, β increases
initially, stays almost constant up to x = 0.09, and decreases again about 15 %. From the β value, we can estimate the Debye
temperatures by the relation ΘD = (12π4nR/5β )1/3, where n is the number of atoms per formula unit (n = 3), and R is the gas
constant. For phonon-mediated, one-band superconductors, the electron-phonon coupling constant (λep) can be also estimated

Assuming the Coulomb pseudopotential µ∗ to be 0.15 empirically, we have determined the variation of λep with x as shown in
the Fig.6(d). Note that the estimated value of λep = 0.39 for the undoped compound is consistent with the reported value in
literature.3 In case of a multiband superconductor, application of the above equation that has been developed for one band
superconductor should have its own limit. However, the obtained λep could qualitatively reﬂect the average of the eigenvalues
in the electron-phonon interaction matrix.45

We found that λep shows qualitatively similar variation with TC but changes within 10 % except the initial steep increase
from 0.39 for x = 0 to 0.60 for x = 0.03. With the value of γn and λep, the density of states at the Fermi level N(EF) can
γn. Figure 6(d) shows the evaluated N(EF) with x. Similar to γn, N(EF)
be calculated from the equation N(EF) =
increases systematically with x from 1.64 states/eV f.u. for x = 0 to 2.16 states/eV f.u. for x = 0.09, and decreases again
at higher doping above 0.09. Therefore, it is concluded that the Pd intercalation into the 2H-TaSe2 indeed resulted in the
maximum values of γn and N(EF) near the optimal doping level of x=0.09, similar to the evolution of TC. The increase
of N(EF) as doping is increased toward an optimal doping has been previously found in TaSe2−xTex too. However, the
structure of TaSe2−xTex has changed from the 2H to 3R structure with Te doping24 so that it was difﬁcult to judge whether the
structural change was essential or not to increase of N(EF) (or λep) and thus TC of BCS superconductivity in a broad class of
TMDCs. The observation of qualitative proportionality between N(EF) and TC in PdxTaSe2 with the same structure indicates that
the increase of N(EF) (or λep) becomes more fundamental to increase TC, regardless of the structural evolution in many TMDCs.

Phase diagram and Discussion
We have summarized the electronic phase diagram in the 2H-PdxTaSe2 system as shown in Fig.7. With Pd intercalation, the
CCDW phase is suppressed dramatically compared to the ICDW phase. As the TCCDW is progressively suppressed, Tc(x)
increases systematically. The phase diagram reveals a classic dome shape with an optimal TC for x = 0.08-0.09. Most

determined from the normal state susceptibility data, the green squares represent TCCDW determined from the maximum of the
dρ/dT curve in Fig.2 and the red circles represent TC determined from the onset of diamagnetic susceptibility in Fig.4. For
clarity the TC value have been multiplied by 5 times.

importantly, the collapse of CCDW phase is almost coincident with the doping levels of showing an optimal TC, supporting
clearly the competition between CCDW phase and superconductivity. On the other hand, TICDW slowly decreases from 122 to
106 K regardless of the superconducting dome, suggesting that there is no direct association with each other.

Related to this, it is worthwhile to discuss the distinct features of the phase diagram of 2H-PdxTaSe2 system with other
systems with the same 2H structure. The presence of two CDW transitions is indeed unique in the 2H-TaSe2 because all other
2H compounds have shown only one incommensurate CDW transition. For example, both 2H-NbSe2 and 2H-TaS2 showed
only the ICDW phase.1, 2, 13 Furthermore, although either pressure or intercalation of Cu ions suppressed the ICDW phase
46 and 2H-TaS2,5 respectively, the collapse of the ICDW did not occur at the
and enhanced superconductivity in 2H-NbSe2
optimal TC in both cases. For 2H-NbSe2, the collapse point is located well below optimal TC while for 2H-TaS2, it is well
above. Therefore, direct competition between ICDW and superconductivity doesn’t seem to happen in those other compounds
with the 2H structure. Consistent with this, it has been recently claimed by theoretical calculations and inelastic x-ray scattering
that the electron-phonon coupling of the soft acoustic mode could be mainly responsible for ICDW formation in 2H-NbSe2,
while the optical phonon mode is coupled to the creation of superconductivity.46 Our observation of very weak dependence of
ICDW phase with superconductivity clearly supports that superconductivity is not related to the ICDW phase in 2H-PdxTaSe2
too, being similar to the case in 2H-NbSe2.46 This also implies in 2H-TaSe2 that a speciﬁc type of electron-phonon coupling
required to stabilize the ICDW phase might be also different from that for inducing superconductivity. Furthermore, the strong
competition of the CCDW with the superconductivity in turn suggests that a same type of phonon mode might be responsible
for stabilizing both the superconductivity and CCDW in 2H-TaSe2.

One interesting question to check is whether the increase of TC via the increase of N(EF) and λep as observed here could be
generally applied to other TMDCs even with different structures and dopants. For this, we have compared previous experimental
results of TC, γn, and θD, and calculated N(EF) and λep in various known TMDCs in the literature as summarized in Table 1. To
our surprise, we ﬁnd that although signiﬁcant variation exists in N(EF) but not in λep within the doped 2H-TaSe2 and 2H-TaS2,
N(EF) is almost proportional to TC in each system, regardless of their structural forms. Therefore, N(EF) seems to be the key
factor rather the structural motif for determining TC magnitude. At the same time, when N(EF) is almost same, the variation of
λep, albeit small, is still helpful in increasing Tc. Moreover, between the materials with a different parent compound such as
1T -CuxTiS2 and 2H-TaS2, the magnitude of λep was also important to determine the TC magnitude. Based on all these results,
we conclude that TC is strongly dependent on N(EF) while it is also affected by λep.

At present, what is a generic origin for the variation of N(EF) in the PdxTaSe2 system remains as an open question. One
scenario is that N(EF) increases due to the proximity of the system to the quantum critical point of the CCDW state. If this

cause the increase of N(EF). Another scenario is that the Pd intercalation has provided the increase of partial Pd density of state
by direct hybridization with the TaSe2 states near the Fermi level or by indirect lattice modulation. It might be worthwhile to
check the feasibility of both scenarios in future studies.

In conclusion, we have investigated the effect of Pd intercalation into the 2H-TaSe2 compound. Pd ion can be used
a suitable tuning parameter to explore the intricate balance between CDW and superconductivity in 2H-TaSe2. A dome
shape TC(x) curve is observed with an optimal TC ∼ 3.3 K for x = 0.08-0.09, constituting enhancement of TC of 2H-TaSe2
by a factor of 24. Pd intercalation drastically suppresses the CCDW phase and but does not have any strong effect on the
ICDW transition in 2H-TaSe2. Analysis of speciﬁc heat data shows an evidence that Pd intercalation increase the effective
electron-phonon coupling and density of states at the Fermi energy. Observation of qualitative proportionality between N(EF)
and TC in PdxTaSe2 with the same structure suggests that the increase of N(EF) (or λep) becomes more necessary to increase TC.
The temperature-dependence of Hc2, Cel and γH all conﬁrm the presence of multi-gap superconductivity in the 2H-PdxTaSe2
compound.

Methods
Polycrystalline samples of PdxTaSe2 for different values of x were synthesized via solid state reaction method. Stoichiometric
amounts of Pd (99.98%), Ta (99.9%) and Se (99.999%) powder were mixed, grounded well and pelletized. The pellets were
sealed in an evacuated quartz tube and then kept at 900 ◦C for 4 days. The obtained pellets were crushed, regrounded, pelletized
again and resealed in an evacuated quartz tube. The pellets were reannealed for another 5 days at 900 ◦C. Single crystal of the
PdxTaSe2 were grown by the chemical vapor transport method using SeCl4 as a transport agent. Millimeter-sized hexagonal
shaped crystals were collected from the cold end of the quartz tube. The phase purity of the samples were determined by the
powder x-ray diffraction using Cu Kα radiation at room temperature. Rietveld analyses of the powder diffraction pattern were
performed using the fullprof suits. Resistivity was measured by the conventional four probe method using silver paste (Dupont
4929NTM) in a PPMSTM (Quantum Design) and a dilution refrigerator. Dc magnetic susceptibility was measured in a MPMSTM
(Quantum design). Speciﬁc heat data were measured with PPMSTM and a dilution refrigerator by using a custom-made program
employing the relaxation method with two relaxation times. To determine the actual composition of Pd in the samples, electron
probe micro analysis (EPMA) was performed on the polycrystalline samples by considering the Pd metal as standard specimens.
