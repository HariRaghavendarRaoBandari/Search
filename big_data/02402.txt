INVERSE SCATTERING FOR THE MAGNETIC

SCHR ¨ODINGER OPERATOR ON SURFACES WITH

EUCLIDEAN ENDS

VALTER POHJOLA AND LEO TZOU

Abstract. We prove a ﬁxed frequency inverse scattering result for the
magnetic Schr¨odinger operator (or connection Laplacian) on surfaces
with Euclidean ends. We show that, under suitable decaying conditions,
the scattering matrix for the operator determines both the gauge class
of the connection and the zeroth order potential.

1. Introduction

The purpose of this paper is to show that the scattering matrix SX,V (λ)
of the magnetic Schr¨odinger operator (d + iX)∗(d + iX) + V determines V
and the gauge class of the 1-form X on Riemann surfaces with Euclidean
ends.

When X = 0 this was done by in [11] and we refer the reader to the article

for all the relevant references and results in this case.

In dimensions n ≥ 3 the problem of scattering by the magnetic Schr¨odinger
operator was ﬁrst considered in the simply connected setting by [6] in the
smooth case and later by [25] for less regular coeﬃcients. As the setting is
Euclidean, determining the gauge of X is equivalent to determining its exte-
rior derivative. Some cohomological aspects of this problem was considered
in [2, 3] which described the Aharanov-Bohm eﬀect using inverse scattering.
These works still take place in the Euclidean setting and the topology is
obtained by removing open balls from Rn. Observe that when one assumes
the coeﬃcients are compactly supported, the inverse scattering problem is
equivalent to the Calder´on problem on the domain of support and this was
done in [21] for n ≥ 3 and [13, 10] for n = 2.
In the present work we focus on the more geometric aspect of the problem
where the ambient manifold is a general Riemann surface with Euclidean
ends. We prove the following theorem

Theorem 1.1. Let (M0, g0) be a non-compact Riemann surface with genus
G and N ends isometric to R2 \ {|z| ≤ 1} with metric |dz|2. Let V1, V2 ∈
C 1,β(M0) be two potentials with β > 0 and X1, X2 ∈ H 3+ǫ0(M0) for some
ǫ0 > 0 be two 1-forms such that SX1,V1(λ) = SX2,V2(λ) for some λ ∈ R\{0}.
Let d(z, z0) denote the distance between z and a ﬁxed point z0 ∈ M0.
If N ≥ max(2G +1, 2), Vj ∈ e−γd(·,z0)L∞(M0), and Xj ∈ e−γd(·,z0)H 3+ǫ0(M0)
for all γ > 0, then there exists a unitary function Θ ∈ 1+e−γd(·,z0)W 1,∞(M0)

for all γ > 0 such that X1 − X2 = dΘ/Θ and V1 = V2.

The approach we take in dealing with the non-trivial magnetic term Xj is
by viewing d + iXj as a unitary connection acting on the trivial line bundle
over M0. Composition with the projection π0,1 : T ∗M0 → T ∗
0,1M0 yields a
Cauchy-Riemann operator ( ¯∂ + iAj) := π0,1(d + iX) which, by [17], yields a
unique complex structure that can be trivialized by choosing a non-vanishing
holomorphic section FAj .

The advantage of such trivializations is that it acts as a bridge between
the two Cauchy-Riemann operators ( ¯∂ + iA1) and ( ¯∂ + iA2).
Intuitively,
this would eﬀectively reduce the problem to the simpler case where X1 =
X2 = 0 and one can then apply the techniques of [11]. Unfortunately, it is
not always true that this conjugation between complex structures preserves
the scattering information at inﬁnity. We will see, in fact, that one can
judiciously choose the trivializations to preserve this information precisely
when the scattering matrices agree. It will become apparent that this is a
global result about the trivialization rather than a local one of determining
the asymptotic expansions of certain coeﬃcients at inﬁnity. In this sense
the ”boundary determination” performed here is quite diﬀerent from those
in [39, 16, 15].

This approach to treating Cauchy-Riemann operators was explored in
[34], [1], and [10] for studying inverse boundary value problems. The set-
ting of this article, however, is on a non-compact surface and therefore the
previously used techniques for Calder´on problems do not immediately apply.
The technique used here is the machinery of the b-calculus developed
by Melrose in [19]. We will show that the condition SX1,V2(λ) = SX2,V2(λ)
induces an orthogonality relation between the diﬀerence of the trivializations
and antiholomorphic 1-forms which belong to certain weighted L2 spaces.
Due to the results of b-calculus we can invoke Fredholm theory to show
the existence of a holomorphic function which has the same expansion near
inﬁnity as the diﬀerence of the trivializations.

In addition to this complication, the presence of a ﬁrst-order term requires
the construction of a diﬀerent type of CGO and a diﬀerent integral idenitity
than those used in [11]. Particularly, in order to recover the gauge class
of X we will construct a class of CGOs which is compatible with the new
boundary integral identity

ZM0h(|FA1|−2 − |FA2|−2) ¯∂˜v, ¯∂ ˜wi +
relating the size of the two trivializations |FAj|. The modulus of the trivial-
izations turns out to carry all the information we need to recover the gauge
class (see Proof of Proposition 8.1).

2h(Q1|FA1|2 − Q2|FA2|2)˜v, ˜wi = 0,

The organization of this article is as follows. In Section 2 we prove general
facts about holomorphic functions and Fredholm properties of the Cauchy-
Riemann operators on weighted spaces. Section 3 will be devoted to Car-
leman estimates on weighted spaces which can produce higher regularity
solvability results than those in [11]. In Section 4 we develop the scattering

INVERSE SCATTERING FOR THE MAGNETIC SCHR ¨ODINGER OPERATOR

theory for the magnetic Schr¨odinger operator and construct the scattering
matrix. We will show in Section 5 that the scattering matrix determines the
asymptotic behaviour of the trivialization of the Cauchy-Riemann operator.
This asymptotic behaviour will be exploited in Section 7 when we derive a
new integral identity which is more suitable for recovering the gauge class.
In Section 6 we will construct CGOs which we will then use in Sections 8
and 9 to recover the desired information.

2. Holomorphic Morse functions on a surface with Euclidean

ends

2.1. Riemann surfaces with Euclidean ends. The contents of this sec-
tion are similar to that in [11]. We include it here only for the convenience
of the reader.

Let (M0, g0) be a non-compact connected smooth Riemannian surface
with N ends E1, . . . , EN which are Euclidean, i.e. isometric to C\{|z| ≤ 1}
with metric |dz|2. By using a complex inversion z → 1/z, each end is also
isometric to a pointed disk

Ei ≃ {|z| ≤ 1, z 6= 0} with metric |dz|2
|z|4

thus conformal to the Euclidean metric on the pointed disk. The surface
M0 can then be compactiﬁed by adding the points corresponding to z = 0
in each pointed disk corresponding to an end Ei, we obtain a closed Rie-
mann surface M with a natural complex structure induced by that of M0, or
equivalently a smooth conformal class on M induced by that of M0. Another
way of thinking is to say that M0 is the closed Riemann surface M with N
points e1, . . . , eN removed. The Riemann surface M has holomorphic charts
zβ : Uβ → C and we will denote by z1, . . . zN the complex coordinates cor-
responding to the ends of M0, or equivalently to the neighbourhoods of the
points ei. The Hodge star operator ⋆ acts on the cotangent bundle T ∗M ,
its eigenvalues are ±i and the respective eigenspaces T ∗
1,0M := ker(⋆ + iId)
and T ∗
0,1M := ker(⋆ − iId) are sub-bundles of the complexiﬁed cotangent
bundle CT ∗M and the splitting CT ∗M = T ∗
0,1M holds as complex
vector spaces. Since ⋆ is conformally invariant on 1-forms on M , the com-
plex structure depends only on the conformal class of g.
In holomorphic
coordinates z = x + iy in a chart Uβ, one has ⋆(udx + vdy) = −vdx + udy
and

where dz = dx + idy and d¯z = dx − idy. We deﬁne the natural projections
induced by the splitting of CT ∗M

π0,1 : CT ∗M → T ∗

The exterior derivative d deﬁnes the de Rham complex 0 → Λ0 → Λ1 →
Λ2 → 0 where Λk := ΛkT ∗M denotes the real bundle of k-forms on M . Let
us denote CΛk the complexiﬁcation of Λk, then the ∂ and ¯∂ operators can
be deﬁned as diﬀerential operators ∂ : CΛ0 → T ∗

they satisfy d = ∂ + ¯∂ and are expressed in holomorphic coordinates by

∂f = ∂zf dz,
2 (∂x − i∂y) and ∂¯z := 1

with ∂z := 1
∂ and ¯∂ operators from CΛ1 to CΛ2 by setting

¯∂f = ∂¯zf d¯z,

2 (∂x + i∂y). Similarly, one can deﬁne the

∂(ω1,0 + ω0,1) := dω0,1,

¯∂(ω1,0 + ω0,1) := dω1,0

if ω0,1 ∈ T ∗

0,1M and ω1,0 ∈ T ∗
∂(udz + vd¯z) = ∂v ∧ d¯z,

1,0M . In coordinates this is simply
¯∂(udz + vd¯z) = ¯∂u ∧ dz.

If g is a metric on M whose conformal class induces the complex structure
T ∗
1,0M , there is a natural operator, the Laplacian acting on functions and
deﬁned by

where d∗ is the adjoint of d through the metric g and ⋆ is the Hodge star
operator mapping Λ2 to Λ0 and induced by g as well.

∆f := −2i ⋆ ¯∂∂f = d∗d

2.2. Holomorphic functions. We are going to construct Carleman weights
given by holomorphic functions on M0 which grow at most linearly or
quadratically in the ends. We will use the Riemann-Roch theorem, follow-
ing ideas of [9], however, the diﬀerence in the present case is that we have
very little freedom to construct these holomorphic functions, simply because
there is just a ﬁnite dimensional space of such functions by Riemann-Roch.
For the convenience of the reader, and to ﬁx notations, we recall the usual
Riemann-Roch index theorem (see Farkas-Kra [7] for more details). A divi-
sor D on M is an element

i=1 pni

D =(cid:0)(p1, n1), . . . , (pk, nk)(cid:1) ∈ (M × Z)k, where k ∈ N

0 for all p except β(pi) = ni. The inverse divisor of D is deﬁned to be

which will also be denoted D =Qk
i or D =Qp∈M pβ(p) where β(p) =
D−1 :=Qp∈M p−β(p) and the degree of the divisor D is deﬁned by deg(D) :=
Pk
i=1 ni = Pp∈M β(p). A non-zero meromorphic function on M is said to
have divisor D if (f ) := Qp∈M pord(p) is equal to D, where ord(p) denotes
Notice that in this case we have deg(f ) = 0. For divisors D′ =Qp∈M pβ′(p)
and D =Qp∈M pβ(p), we say that D′ ≥ D if β′(p) ≥ β(p) for all p ∈ M . The

same exact notions apply for meromorphic 1-forms on M . Then we deﬁne
for a divisor D

the order of p as a pole or zero of f (with positive sign convention for zeros).

r(D) := dim({f meromorphic function on M ; (f ) ≥ D} ∪ {0}),
i(D) := dim({u meromorphic 1 form on M ; (u) ≥ D} ∪ {0}).

The Riemann-Roch theorem states the following identity: for any divisor D
on the closed Riemann surface M of genus G,

r(D−1) = i(D) + deg(D) − G + 1.

(1)

Notice also that for any divisor D with deg(D) > 0, one has r(D) = 0 since
deg(f ) = 0 for all f meromorphic. By [7, Th. p70], let D be a divisor, then

INVERSE SCATTERING FOR THE MAGNETIC SCHR ¨ODINGER OPERATOR

5

for any non-zero meromorphic 1-form ω on M , one has

i(D) = r(D(ω)−1)

(2)

which is thus independent of ω. For instance, if D = 1, we know that the only
holomorphic function on M is 1 and one has 1 = r(1) = r((ω)−1)−G +1 and
thus r((ω)−1) = G if ω is a non-zero meromorphic 1 form. Now if D = (ω),
we obtain again from (1)

G = r((ω)−1) = 2 − G + deg((ω))

which gives deg((ω)) = 2(G − 1) for any non-zero meromorphic 1-form ω.
In particular, if D is a divisor such that deg(D) > 2(G − 1), then we get
deg(D(ω)−1) = deg(D) − 2(G − 1) > 0 and thus i(D) = r(D(ω)−1) = 0,
which implies by (1)

deg(D) > 2(G − 1) =⇒ r(D−1) = deg(D) − G + 1 ≥ G.

(3)

Now we deduce the

Lemma 2.1. Let e1, . . . , eN be distinct points on a closed Riemann surface
M with genus G, and let z0 be another point of M \ {e1, . . . , eN}. If N ≥
max(2G + 1, 2), the following hold true:
(i) there exists a meromorphic function f on M with at most simple poles,
all contained in {e1, . . . , eN}, such that ∂f (z0) 6= 0,
(ii) there exists a meromorphic function f on M with at most simple poles,
all contained in {e1, . . . , eN}, such that z0 is a zero of order at least 2 of f .
(iii) there exists a meromorphic function f whose (non-removable) poles are
all simple and form precisely the set {e1, . . . , eN}.
Proof. Let ﬁrst G ≥ 1, so that N ≥ 2G + 1. By the discussion before the
Lemma, we know that there are at least G + 2 linearly independent (over
C) meromorphic functions f0, . . . , fG+1 on M with at most simple poles, all
contained in {e1, . . . , e2G+1}. Without loss of generality, one can set f0 = 1
and by linear combinations we can assume that f1(z0) = ··· = fG+1(z0) = 0.
Now for (ii) consider the divisor Dj = e1 . . . e2G+1z−j
for j = 1, 2, with
0
degree deg(Dj) = 2G + 1 − j, then by the Riemann-Roch formula (more
precisely (3))

1 ) > r(D−1

j ) = G + 2 − j.

r(D−1
Thus, since r(D−1
2 ) = G and using the assumption that G ≥ 1, we
deduce that there is a function in span(f1, . . . , fG+1) which has a zero of order
2 at z0 and a function which has a zero of order exactly 1 at z0. To show (iii)
observe that if N ≥ 2G+1 then r((e1 . . . eN )−1) = N−G+1. Suppose none of
the meromorphic functions with divisor greater than or equal to (e1 . . . eN )−1
has a pole at eN then one would have that r((e1 . . . eN −1)−1) = N − G + 1.
But deg(e1 . . . eN −1) = N − 1 ≥ 2G − 1 so r((e1 . . . eN −1)−1) = N − G by
(3). This is a contradiction and therefore every point of {e1, . . . , eN} is a
pole for some meromorphic function with divisor greater than or equal to
(e1 . . . eN )−1. Taking suitable linear combination of these functions yields a
meromorphic function with simple poles precisely at the points {e1, . . . , eN}.

The same method clearly works if G = 0 by taking N ≥ 2.

2.3. Morse holomorphic functions with prescribed critical points.
We follow in this section the arguments used in [9] to construct holomorphic
functions with non-degenerate critical points (i.e. Morse holomorphic func-
tions) on the surface M0 with genus G and N ends, such that these functions
have at most linear growth in the ends if N ≥ max(2G + 1, 2). We let H
be the complex vector space spanned by the meromorphic functions on M
with divisors larger or equal to e−1
N where e1, . . . eN ∈ M are points
1
corresponding to the ends of M0 as explained in the previous section. Note
that H is a complex vector space of complex dimension greater or equal to
N − G + 1 for the e−1
N divisor. We will also consider the real vector
space H spanned by the real parts and imaginary parts of functions in H,
this is a real vector space which admits a Lebesgue measure. We now prove
the following

Lemma 2.2. The set of functions u ∈ H which are not Morse in M0 has
measure 0 in H, in particular its complement is dense in H.

0 M0) = Tmu(p)(T ∗M0),

Proof. We use an argument very similar to that used by Uhlenbeck [35].
We start by deﬁning m : M0 × H → T ∗M0 by (p, u) 7→ (p, du(p)) ∈ T ∗
p M0.
This is clearly a smooth map, linear in the second variable, moreover mu :=
m(., u) = (·, du(·)) is smooth on M0. The map u is a Morse function if and
0 M0, of T ∗M0, i.e. if
only if mu is transverse to the zero section, denoted T ∗
Image(Dpmu) + Tmu(p)(T ∗
∀p ∈ M0 such that mu(p) = (p, 0).
This is equivalent to the fact that the Hessian of u at critical points is
non-degenerate (see for instance Lemma 2.8 of [35]). We recall the following
transversality result, the proof of which is contained in [35, Th.2] by replac-
ing Sard-Smale theorem by the usual ﬁnite dimensional Sard theorem:
Theorem 2.1. Let m : X × H → W be a C k map and X, W be smooth
manifolds and H a ﬁnite dimensional vector space, if W ′ ⊂ W is a subman-
ifold such that k > max(1, dim X − dim W + dim W ′), then the transver-
sality of the map m to W ′ implies that the complement of the set {u ∈
H; mu is transverse to W ′} in H has Lebesgue measure 0.

We want to apply this result with X := M0, W := T ∗M0 and W ′ :=
T ∗
0 M0, and with the map m as deﬁned above. We have thus proved our
Lemma if one can show that m is transverse to W ′. Let (p, u) such that
m(p, u) = (p, 0) ∈ W ′. Then identifying T(p,0)(T ∗M0) with TpM0 ⊕ T ∗
p M0,
one has

Dm(p,u)(z, v) = (z, dv(p) + Hessp(u)z)

where Hessp(u) is the Hessian of u at the point p, viewed as a linear map
from TpM0 to T ∗
p M0 (note that this is diﬀerent from the covariant Hessian
deﬁned by the Levi-Civita connection). To prove that m is transverse to W ′
we need to show that (z, v) → (z, dv(p) + Hessp(u)z) is onto from TpM0 ⊕ H
to TpM0 ⊕ T ∗
p M0
is onto. But from Lemma 2.1, we know that there exists a meromorphic
function f with real part v = Re(f ) ∈ H such that v(p) = 0 and dv(p) 6= 0
as an element of T ∗
p M0. We can then take v1 := v and v2 := Im(f ), which
are functions of H such that dv1(p) and dv2(p) are linearly independent in

p M0, which is realized if the map v → dv(p) from H to T ∗

p M0 by the Cauchy-Riemann equation ¯∂f = 0. This shows our claim and
T ∗
ends the proof by using Theorem 2.1.

(cid:3)

In particular, by the Cauchy-Riemann equation, Lemma 2.2 implies
Corollary 2.1. The subset of functions in H which are Morse is dense.

This shows, in conjunction with part (iii) of Lemma 2.1 that

Lemma 2.3. Let e1, . . . , eN be distinct points on a closed Riemann surface
M with genus G. If N ≥ max(2G + 1, 2), then there exists a morse mero-
morphic function f whose (non-removable) poles are all simple and form
precisely the set {e1, . . . , eN}.

This discussion allows us to conclude that

Proposition 2.1. There exists a dense set of points p in M0 such that there
exists a Morse holomorphic function f ∈ H on M0 whose (non-removable)
poles are all simple and form precisely the set {e1, . . . , eN} which has a
critical point at p.

Proof. Let p be a point of M0 and let u be a holomorphic function with
a zero of order at least 2 at p, the existence is ensured by Lemma 2.1.
Let B(p, η) be a any small ball of radius η > 0 near p, then by Lemma
2.2, for any ǫ > 0, we can approach u by a holomorphic Morse function
uǫ ∈ Hǫ whose (non-removable) poles are all simple and form precisely the
set {e1, . . . , eN} and which is at distance less than ǫ of u in a ﬁxed norm on
the ﬁnite dimensional space H. Rouch´e’s theorem for ∂zuǫ and ∂zu (which
are viewed as functions locally near p) implies that ∂zuǫ has at least one
zero of order exactly 1 in B(p, η) if ǫ is chosen small enough. Thus there is
a Morse function in H with a critical point arbitrarily close to p.
(cid:3)
Remark 2.1. In the case where the surface M has genus 0 and N ends,
we have an explicit formula for the function in Proposition 2.1:
indeed
M0 is conformal to C \ {e1, . . . , eN −1} for some ei ∈ C - i.e. the Riemann
sphere minus N points - then the function f (z) = (z − z0)2/(z − e1) with
z0 6∈ {e1, . . . , eN −1} has z0 for unique critical point in C\{e1, . . . , eN −1} and
it is non-degenerate.

We end this section by the following Lemmas which will be used for the
amplitude of the complex geometric optics solutions but not for the phase.
Lemma 2.4. For any p0, p1, . . . pn ∈ M0 some points of M0 and L ∈ N, then
there exists a function a(z) holomorphic on M0 which vanishes to order L
at all pj for j = 1, . . . , n and such that a(p0) 6= 0. Moreover a(z) can be
|a(z)| ≤ C|z|J
chosen to have at most polynomial growth in the ends, i.e.
for some J ∈ N. The analogous statement can be made about holomorphic
1-forms.

It suﬃces to ﬁnd on M some meromorphic function with divisor

Lemma 2.5. Let {p0, p1, .., pn} ⊂ M0 be a set of n + 1 disjoint points. Let
c0, c1, . . . , cK ∈ C, L ∈ N, and let z be a complex coordinate near p0 such
that p0 = {z = 0}. Then there exists a holomorphic function f on M0 with
zeros of order at least L at each pj, such that f (z) = c0 + c1z + ... + cKzK +
O(|z|K+1) in the coordinate z. Moreover f can be chosen so that there is

As in the proof of Lemma 2.4, if J is taken large enough, there exists a
function with divisor greater or equal to D := e−J

not greater or equal to Dp0. Then it suﬃces to multiply this function by cK
times the inverse of the coeﬃcient of zK in its Taylor expansion at z = 0. (cid:3)

2.4. Laplacian on weighted spaces. Let x be a smooth positive function
on M0, which is equal to |z|−1 for |z| > r0 in the ends Ei ≃ {z ∈ C;|z| > 1},
where r0 is a large ﬁxed number. We now show that the Laplacian ∆g0 on
a surface with Euclidean ends has a right inverse on the weighted spaces
x−J L2(M0) for J /∈ N positive.
Lemma 2.6. For any J > −1 which is not an integer, there exists a continu-
ous operator G mapping x−J L2(M0) to x−J−2L2(M0) such that ∆g0G = Id.

Proof. Let gb := x2g0 be a metric conformal to g0. The metric gb in the
ends can be written gb = dx2/x2 + dθ2
S1 by using radial coordinates x =
|z|−1, θ = z/|z| ∈ S1, this is thus a b-metric in the sense of Melrose [19],
giving the surface a geometry of surface with cylindrical ends. Let us deﬁne
for m ∈ N0
H m
θ u ∈ L2(M0; dvolgb ) for all j + k ≤ m}.
b (M0) := {u ∈ L2(M0; dvolgb ); (x∂x)j∂k
The Laplacian has the form ∆gb = −(x∂x)2 + ∆S1 in the ends, and the
indicial roots of ∆gb in the sense of Section 5.2 of [19] are given by the
complex numbers λ such that x−iλ∆gbxiλ is not invertible as an operator
acting on the circle S1
θ . Thus the indicial roots are the solutions of λ2+k2 = 0
where k2 runs over the eigenvalues of ∆S1, that is, k ∈ Z. The roots are
simple at ±ik ∈ iZ \ {0} and 0 is a double root. In Theorem 5.60 of [19],
Melrose proves that ∆gb is Fredholm on xaH 2
b (M0) if and only if −a is not
the imaginary part of some indicial root, that is here a 6∈ Z. For J > 0, the
kernel of ∆gb on the space xJ H 2
b (M0) is clearly trivial by an energy estimate.
Thus ∆gb : x−J H 0
(M0) is surjective for J > 0 and J 6∈ Z,
and the same then holds for ∆gb : x−J H 2
b (M0) by elliptic
regularity.

b (M0) → x−J H −2

b (M0) → x−J H 0

Now we can use Proposition 5.64 of [19], which asserts, for all positive J 6∈

2.5. Cauchy-Riemann Operator on Weighted Space. We begin this
section with a discussion about the Fredholm properties of the operator ¯∂ on
non-compact manifolds by using the results of b-calculus. If M0 is a surface
with N Euclidean ends, then one may take the N point compactiﬁcation to
obtain a closed surface M = M0∪{e1, . . . , eN}. In a holomorphic coordinate
neighbourhood Ej of ej the metric can be written in polar coordinates as
g0 = dx2
x2 . By extending x to be a smooth positive function on M0 one
obtains a b-metric deﬁned by gb := x2g0. In this setting M0 is a bordered
manifold with x as its boundary deﬁning function.

x4 + dθ2

Let Vb denote the sections of T M0 which are tangential to ∂M0 at the
boundary and bT M0 be the bundle so that Vb = C ∞(M0,b T M0). Denoting
its dual bundle by bT ∗M0 one sees that near x = 0 the b-tangent and b-
cotangent bundles are spanned by unitary (co)vectors {x∂x, ∂θ} and { dx
x , dθ}
respectively. The complexiﬁed b-cotangent bundle CbT ∗M0 has a splitting
into bT ∗
1,0M0 given by the complex structure induced by gb.

The Cauchy-Riemann operator is invariant within a conformal class of
metric. However, for all u ∈ C ∞(M0) it is convenient to express ¯∂u locally
near x = 0 as a section of bT ∗

0,1M0 ⊕b T ∗

0,1M0:

¯∂u = (∂xu +

i
x

∂θu)(dx + ixdθ) = (x∂xu + i∂θu)(

dx
x

+ idθ).

Written in this way one sees that ¯∂ ∈ Diﬀ 1
with indicial family

b (M0; C,b T ∗

0,1M0). It is also elliptic

Ix( ¯∂, s)u =

i

(−su + ∂θu)(

+ idθ)

b

which has simple roots whenever s ∈ iZ by taking u(0, θ) = e−sθ. We
can therefore conclude by Theorem 5.60 [19] that ¯∂ : xJ H m
b (M0, C) →
xJ H m−1

0,1M0) is Fredholm whenever J /∈ Z where

(M0,b T ∗

xJ H m

b (M0) := {u ∈ L2(M0; dvolgb ); (x∂x)j∂k

θ u ∈ xJ L2(M0; dvolgb )∀j + k ≤ m}.
We are now in a position to characterize the range of the ¯∂ operator in
these weighted Sobolev spaces. Indeed, if we denote by b ¯∂∗ the adjoint of ¯∂
under the metric gb we see that for J /∈ Z and m ≥ 1,
0,1M0);ZM0hω, ηigb dvolgb = 0, ∀η ∈ N−J,−m+1(b ¯∂∗)}.
RJ,m( ¯∂) = {ω ∈ xJ H m−1
Here, for all J, m ∈ R, RJ,m( ¯∂) and NJ,m(b ¯∂∗) denote respectively the range
and kernel of the operators ¯∂ and b ¯∂∗ acting on their respective sections in
xJ H m
b . By elliptic regularity (Theorem 5.61 and (5.165) in [19]) this becomes

0,1M0);ZM0hω, ηigb dvolgb = 0, ∀η ∈ N−J,m(b ¯∂∗)}

We look at the relationship between NJ,m(b ¯∂∗) and the null space of ¯∂∗
acting on T ∗
0,1M0) then it is a
weighted H m section of the bundle bT ∗
0,1M0 which is a subspace of the dual
space of the bundle whose smooth sections are the vector ﬁelds tangent to the
boundary. Therefore, locally in the interior η has coordinate expression η =
ud¯z with u ∈ H m and thus η is a H m
0,1M0. Near the boundary

where x = 0, η has the coordinate expression η = u d¯z
x + idθ) where
b (M0). Therefore, if η ∈ NJ,m(b ¯∂∗) then u is an antiholomorphic
u ∈ xJ H m
function satisfying R|x|<1 |x−J u|2 1
x dxdθ < ∞. Taking the Laurent series
expression for u we have that u must have a zero of at least order ⌈J⌉ at
each end which implies that η = u d¯z
¯z has a zero of order at least ⌊J⌋. This
means that

¯z = u( dx

η ∈ NJ,m(b ¯∂∗) ⇒ ¯∂∗η = 0 and η ∈ xJ L2(M0, dvolg0).

(5)

Furthermore, combining this discussion with standard argument about re-
movability of singularities gives the the following Lemma and its Corollaries:
Lemma 2.7. If η ∈ NJ,m(bT ∗
0,1M0) for J > 0 then η extends antiholomor-
phically to M = M0 ∪ {e1, . . . , eN} with zeroes of order at least ⌊J⌋ at each
of the ends ej, j = 1, . . . , N .

Corollary 2.2. Let M0 be a surface with N ≥ 2G + 1 ends. If J ∈ R\Z
satisﬁes J > 1 then NJ,m(b ¯∂∗) is trivial.

Proof. Lemma 2.7 implies that η can be extended antiholomorphically to a
section of T ∗
0,1M by taking its value to be zero at ej for j = 1, . . . , N . If
N ≥ 2G + 1 this would force its degree (η) to be greater than or equal to
2G + 1 and thus forcing it to be the trivial section.

(cid:3)

Corollary 2.3. Let M0 be a surface with N ≥ 2G + 1 ends. If J ∈ R\Z
satisﬁes 2 > J > 1 then R−J,m( ¯∂) = x−J H m−1
0,1M0). Furthermore,
there exists a bounded operator

is the orthogonal projection on x−J L2

(M0;b T ∗

In the case when η is compactly supported we can easily work out the
expression for the kernel of ¯∂−1
J by using the existing machinery. Indeed, if
K = supp(η) is contained in the interior of M0 then let {χj}l
j=1 be a partition
of unity by C ∞
0 (M0) functions for some open cover of K by holomorphic
coordinate neighbourhoods {Uj}l
j=1 with Uj ⊂⊂ M0. Let χ′

supported smooth function in Uj which is equal to 1 in a neighbourhood of
the support of χj. Deﬁne

κj(z′, z)fj(z′)dz′ ∧ d¯z′(cid:1)

where κj are smooth compactly supported functions in Uj × Uj and ωj are

with ¯∂−1

for 2 > J > 1 we get from Corollary 2.3

κj(z′, z)fj(z′)dz′ ∧ d¯z′

(7)

The expression (7) combined with the explicit formula for the T operator
given by (6) allows us to prove the following

Lemma 2.8. If ψ is a Morse function on M0 and η is a compactly supported
smooth section of T ∗

0,1M0 then for 2 > J > 1 we have
kxJ ¯∂−1

J (e2iψ/hη)kL2

b (M0) ≤ Ch

2 +ǫ.

Here the constant depends on η and the size of its support.

b

J

Proof. Using the expression (7) and replacing η by ei2ψ/hη we see that
J e−2iψ/hη can be bounded by two separate terms. The operator ¯∂−1
¯∂−1
is
bounded from x−J H m−1
b (M0) and the last term is
the composition of this operator with a ﬁnite sum of integrals agains smooth
compactly supported kernels. Therefore, the last term can be treated with
stationary phase to show that its x−J L2

0,1M0) to x−J H m

(M0;b T ∗

b norm is of order h.

b ≤ C(supp(η))h

The ﬁrst term can be estimated by using the explicit expression of the ker-
nel given in (6) and the fact that (Id + Π) is bounded on x−J L2
b (M0). Since
each of χ′
j are compactly supported and we are summing over ﬁnitely many
terms in (6), repeating the same argument as Lemma 2.2 of [10] would yield
2 +ǫkηkW 1,p and the proof is complete
that kxJ T e2iψ/hηkL2
by the boundedness of (Id − Π).
2.6. Construction of Conjugation Factor. If A is a section of T ∗
0,1M0
then the operator ¯∂ + iA is a Cauchy-Riemann operator acting on the trivial
complex line bundle over M0. By [17] there exists a unique holomorphic
structure which is compatible with this Cauchy-Riemann operator and it is
trivialized by a non-vanishing section of the bundle. It is useful to construct

(cid:3)

1

INVERSE SCATTERING FOR THE MAGNETIC SCHR ¨ODINGER OPERATOR

12

an explicit form of this trivialization. In particular, if α is a diﬀerentiable
function satisfying ¯∂α = A, then one has ¯∂ + iA = e−iα ¯∂eiα. It is important
in this article to understand the asymptotic of the trivialization near the
ends. This motivates us to consider the following construction:
Lemma 2.9. Let η ∈ e−γ|z|H 3+ǫ0(C) for all γ > 0. We have the following
expansion for the parametrix of the Cauchy-Riemann operator

1

2π ZC

¯∂−1η(z) :=

dζ ∧ d¯ζ =

so using the fact that η decays super-exponentially we can iterate this rela-
tion get the expansion (8).

2

ζ

η(z − ζ)

dζ ∧ d¯ζ +Z|ζ|≥ |z|

To get the estimate on the remainder we observe again that since η decays
super-exponentially it suﬃces to do this for k = 0. This can be done for
j = 0, by ﬁrst observing that η ∈ e−γ|z|L∞(C), by the Sobolev embedding
Theorem, if η ∈ e−γ|ζ|H 1+ǫ0 and then spliting the integral and estimating
as follows
Z|ζ|≤ |z|

dζ ∧ d¯ζ ≤ C(|z|e−γ|z| + |z|−1).
For j = 1 the estimate can be done by observing that [∂z, ¯∂−1]η is an en-
tire function and furthermore ∂z ¯∂−1η ∈ L2 by Calder´on-Zygmund while
¯∂−1∂zη = O(|z|−1) by the j = 0 case. We conclude then that [∂z, ¯∂−1]η is an
entire function which is in h|z|iǫL2(C) for all ǫ > 0. This forces [∂z, ¯∂−1]η = 0
which means ∂z ¯∂−1η = ¯∂−1∂zη = O(|z|−1) by the fact that η ∈ e−γ|z|H l(C)
and using the j = 0 estimate. This argument can be made as well for for
j = 2 (in fact as many times as the diﬀerentiability of η allows) and the
proof is complete.

Lemma 2.10. Let η ∈ H 1(M0; T ∗

that α ∈ x−J H 2

b (M0; C) with 2 > J > 1 this forces cj = 0 for j ≥ 2.

(cid:3)

Combining Lemmas 2.9 and 2.10 we obtain the following

0,1M0) for all γ > 0. There exists
a function α ∈ x−J H l+1(M0; C), 2 > J > 1 solving ¯∂α = η which for any k

near the ends when |z| → ∞ for j = 0, 1, 2.

3. Carleman Estimates and Solvability

In this section, we prove a Carleman estimate using harmonic weights
with non-degenerate critical points. Our starting point is the estimates
in [11], which are used to obtain an estimate for negative order Sobolev
spaces. Duality will then allows us to prove a H 1
scl solvability result for the
magnetic operator, that will later needed in constructing complex geometric
optics solutions. We remind the reader that we use ∆g to denote the positive
Laplacian.
We ﬁrst consider a Morse holomorphic function Φ ∈ H obtained from Propo-
sition 2.1 with the condition that Φ has linear growth in the ends. We will
write

Φ := ϕ + iψ,

where ϕ := Re(Φ), ψ := Im(Φ).

(9)

The Carleman weight will consist of the harmonic function ϕ = Re(Φ). We
let x be a positive smooth function on M0 such that x = |z|−1 in the complex
charts {z ∈ C;|z| > 1} ≃ Ej covering the end Ej. We will assume without
loss of generality that Φ (and therefore ϕ) does not have critical points in Ej.

We modify our weight using a function ϕ0. Let δ ∈ (0, 1) be small and
let us take ϕ0 ∈ x−βL2(M0) a solution of ∆g0ϕ0 = x2−δ, a solution exists
by Proposition 2.6 if β > 1 + δ. Actually, by using Proposition 5.61 of [19],
if we choose β < 2, then it is easy to see that ϕ0 is smooth on M0 and has
polyhomogeneous expansion as |z| → ∞, with leading asymptotic in the end
Ei given by ϕ0 = −x−δ/δ2 + ci log(x) + di + O(x) for some ci, di which are
smooth functions in S1.
We will modify our weight function one step further to allow more general-
ity. We assume that α is as in Proposition 2.2, with ¯∂α = η ∈ e−γ/xH 3+ǫ0(M0).
In particular that α has a leading asymptotics in the end Ej given by

z(cid:0)α − (c1z + c0 + ··· + c−kz−k)(cid:1)| ≤ Cj,k|z|−(k+1)
|∂j

near the ends when |z| → ∞ for j = 0, 1, 2. For ǫ > 0 small, we deﬁne the
convexiﬁed weight

ϕǫ := ϕ + hRe(iα) −

ϕ0.

(10)

INVERSE SCATTERING FOR THE MAGNETIC SCHR ¨ODINGER OPERATOR

It follows that ϕǫ has an expansion at inﬁnity of the form

dϕǫ = γ1dz1 + γ2dz2 + O(r−1+δ),
¯z ϕǫ(z) = O(r−2+δ) for all κ + µ ≥ 2.

z ∂µ

(11)

The following estimate was proved in [34] with γ′
2 = 0 but as they are
lower order terms in the phase and the domain one considers is compact,
the same proof holds in the slightly more general case of ϕǫ. See Proposition
3.1 in [34] for details.

1 = γ′

Proposition 3.1. Let K ⊂ M0 be compact and the ϕǫ the previously
deﬁned weight. Then for u ∈ C ∞

0 (K), we have

where C depends on K but not on h and ǫ.

We will use semiclassical pseudodiﬀerential calculus in the following proofs.
A function a ∈ C ∞(R2 × R2) is in the semiclassical symbol class S k(hξim),
if
(12)

x ∂β
|∂α

ξ a(y, ξ; h)| ≤ Cαβh−khξim,

where Cαβ is independent of the parameter h, see [28] and [40]. We will use
the abbreviation S m := S 0(hξim).

We will need to prove an analogue of Proposition 3.1 for the ends. Com-
bining these will give us a global estimate in the semiclassical H −1-norm. We
begin by proving the following weighted L2-estimate, which is essentially the
same as Proposition 3.1 in [11], apart from the more general weight function
used here. We give the proof here as a convenience to the reader.

Proposition 3.2. Let δ ∈ (0, 1), and ϕǫ as above, then there exists C > 0
such that for all ǫ ≫ h > 0 small enough, and all u ∈ C ∞

Proof. The metric g0 can be extended to R2 to be the Euclidean metric
and we shall denote by ∆ the ﬂat positive Laplacian on R2. Let us write
P := ∆g0 − λ2, then the operator Ph := h2eϕǫ/hP e−ϕǫ/h is given by

Ph = h2∆ − |dϕǫ|2 + 2h∇ϕǫ.∇ − h∆ϕǫ − h2λ2,

is a semiclassical operator with a semiclassical full Weyl symbol

σw(Ph) := |ξ|2 − |dϕǫ|2 − h2λ2 + 2ihdϕǫ, ξi = a + ib ∈ S 2.

h )/2 = h2∆ − |dϕǫ|2 − h2λ2 and B := (Ph −
We can deﬁne A := (Ph + P ∗
P ∗
h )/2i = −2ih∇ϕǫ.∇ + ih∆ϕǫ which have respective semiclassical full sym-
bols a and b, i.e. A = Opw(a) and B = Opw(b) for the Weyl quantization.

INVERSE SCATTERING FOR THE MAGNETIC SCHR ¨ODINGER OPERATOR

15

Notice that A, B are symmetric operators, thus for all u ∈ C ∞

0 (Ei)

||(A + iB)u||2 = h(A2 + B2 + i[A, B])u, ui.

It is easy to check that the operator ih−1[A, B] is a semiclassical diﬀerential
operator in S 2 with full semiclassical symbol

{a, b}(ξ) = 4(D2ϕǫ(dϕǫ, dϕǫ) + D2ϕǫ(ξ, ξ))

(13)

(14)

Let us now decompose the Hessian of ϕǫ in the basis (dϕǫ, θ) where θ
is a covector orthogonal to dϕǫ and of norm |dϕǫ|. This yields coordinates
ξ = ξ0dϕǫ + ξ1θ and there exist smooth functions M, N, K so that

D2ϕǫ(ξ, ξ) = |dϕǫ|2(M ξ2

0 + N ξ2

1 + 2Kξ0ξ1).

The asymptotics in (11) imply that M, N, K ∈ r−2+δL∞(Ei). Then one can
write

{a, b} =4|dϕǫ|2(M + M ξ2

0 + N ξ2

1 + 2Kξ0ξ1)

=4(N (a + h2λ2) + ((M − N )ξ0 + 2Kξ1)b/2 + (N + M )|dϕǫ|2)

and since
M + N = Tr(D2ϕǫ) = −∆ϕǫ = h∆Re(iα) + h∆ϕ0/ǫ =
with ∆α = ¯∂∗η ∈ e−γ|z|H 2+ǫ0(R2) ⊂ e−γ|z|W 1,∞(R2) we obtain

Now, we take a smooth extension of |dϕǫ|2, a(z, ξ), ℓ(z, ξ), α(z) and r to
z ∈ R2, this can done for instance by extending r as a smooth positive
function on R2 and then extending dϕ and dϕ0 to smooth non vanishing
1-forms on R2 (not necessarily exact) so that |dϕǫ|2 is smooth positive (for
small h) and polynomial in h and a, ℓ are of the same form as in {|z| > 1}.
Let us deﬁne the symbol and quantized diﬀerential operator on R2

e := 4|dϕǫ|2(c(z)(a + h2λ2) + ℓ(z, ξ)b), E := Opw(e)

In the following proofs we need some additional facts about the semiclas-
sical calculus. Firstly recall that a symbol a ∈ S m corresponds in the so
called classical quantization to an operator Oph(a) = a(y, hD) deﬁned by

Oph(a)f (y) = (2π)−2ZR2

eiy·ξa(y, hξ; h) ˆf (ξ) dξ.

We use σ(A) to denote the symbol corresponding to to a semiclassical op-
erator A.

Moreover we need a formula for the commutator of two semiclassical oper-
. We have that σ([Oph(a), Oph(b)]) ∈

ators with symbols a ∈ S m and b ∈ S m′
S m+m′

and

σ([Oph(a), Oph(b)]) =

(∇ξa · ∇yb − ∇ya · ∇ξb) + h2S m+m′

See [28]. We shall moreover utilize the following Proposition from [28]. It is
convenient to formulate this using the weighted semiclassical spaces H s
δ,scl,
deﬁned by the norm kfkH s
Proposition 3.3. Let a ∈ S 0 and δ0 ≥ 0. Then Oph(a) is bounded
δ,scl(Rn) for any s, δ ∈ R, and there is a constant C with

We now prove a weighted version of Proposition 3.1 that holds in the

ends. This is done by shifting the estimate of Proposition 3.2.

Proposition 3.4. Let δ ∈ (0, 1), and ϕǫ as above, then there exists C > 0
such that for all ǫ ≫ h > 0 small enough, and all u ∈ C ∞

In particular r = x−1 and Ph := eϕǫ/hh2(∆ − λ2)e−ϕǫ/h.
Let χ ∈ C ∞(R2), be such that χ(y) = 1, in R2 \ D1 and χ(y) = 0, near
1/2. Now consider the function χhhDi−1u, where u ∈ C ∞
0 (R2 \ D1). It is

straight forward to see, using a density argument that Proposition 3.2 applies
to functions in the Schwartz class, so that we may apply it to χhhDi−1u and
get that

We can absorb the commutator term by the ﬁrst term on the left hand side,
when h is small, since [d, rθ] = θrθ−1. It is hence enough to estimate the
term containing the weighted Sobolev norm from below. We have that

kχhhDi−1ukH 1

θ,scl − k[χ,hhDi−1]ukH 1
By expression (19) for the symbol of a commutator we have that

σ([χ,hhDi−1]) = −

It follows then from Proposition 3.3 that

The commutator can be estimated by Lemma 3.2

We can hence absorb the commutator by the ﬁrst term, when h is small and

when h is small. We can thus estimate the left hand side of (20) from below
as follows

2 −1ukL2 ≤ kPh(χhhDi−1u)kL2 .

(23)

Splitting the right hand side of (23) using the basic properties of commuta-
tors, gives that

kPh(χhhDi−1u)kL2 ≤ kχhhDi−1PhukL2
+ kχ[Ph,hhDi−1]ukL2
+ h2keϕǫ/h[∆ − λ2, χ](e−ϕǫ/hhhDi−1u)kL2.

(24)

To obtain the estimate in the statement of the Proposition, we need to show
that the second and third term can be absorbed by the left hand side of
(23), when ǫ is chosen small enough. This can be done if we can bound
these terms in the weighted L2-norm.

INVERSE SCATTERING FOR THE MAGNETIC SCHR ¨ODINGER OPERATOR

19

Writing out the commutator in the third term yields

h2keϕǫ/h[∆, χ](e−ϕǫ/hhhDi−1u)kL2 ≤ Ch2(cid:0)k∆χhhDi−1ukL2
+ keϕǫ/h∇χ · ∇e−ϕǫ/hhhDi−1ukL2
+ k∇χ∇(hhDi−1u)kL2(cid:1).

We now ﬁnd bounds for the terms on the right hand side in the weighted L2-
norm. For the last term we note that σ(h∇hhDi−1) ∈ S 0. By Proposition
3.3 we know that h∇hhDi−1 : L2

θ is continuous and hence that

θ → L2

h2k∇χ∇(hhDi−1u)kL2 ≤ Chkh∇(hhDi−1u)kL2

θ ≤ ChkukL2

θ

.

For the two remaining terms, we have that σ(hhDi−1) ∈ S −1. By Proposi-
tion 3.3 we know that hhDi−1 : L2
θ is continuous and thus we have in
the same way that

θ → L2

h2(k∆χhhDi−1ukL2 + keϕǫ/h∇χ · ∇e−ϕǫ/hhhDi−1ukL2) ≤ ChkukL2

θ

.

Combining the two previous estimates, gives an estimate for the second
commutator term in (24), i.e.

h2keϕǫ/h[∆, χ](e−ϕǫ/hhhDi−1u)kL2 ≤ ChkukL2

θ

.

It remains to estimate the ﬁrst commutator term in (24). I.e. we want to

show that

kχ[Ph,hhDi−1]ukL2 ≤ CkukL2

θ

.

Parts of Ph commute with hhDi−1, so that we are left with

[Ph, hhDi−1] = [−|dϕǫ|2, hhDi−1] + 2h[∇ϕǫ · ∇, hhDi−1]

− h[∆ϕǫ, hhDi−1].

(25)

(26)

As in the proof of Proposition 3.2, we utilize the asymptotics given by (11)
according to which |dϕǫ|2 = c + O(rθ+δ/2), where c is a constant and ∆ϕǫ =
O(r−1+θ+δ/2). This enables us to apply Lemma 3.2 to the ﬁrst and third
commutator in (26), by which we get an improvement in decay, which is
crucial. We get that

k[|dϕǫ|2, hhDi−1]ukL2 + kh[∆ϕǫ, hhDi−1]kL2 ≤ Chkhriθ+δ/2−1ukL2

,

≤ ChkukL2

θ

where C independent of ǫ. The second commutator term in (26) is

2h[∇ϕǫ · ∇, hhDi−1] = 2∇ϕǫ · [h∇, hhDi−1] + 2[∇ϕǫ·, hhDi−1]h∇

= [∇ϕǫ·, hhDi−1]h∇.

The asymptotics in (11) give that ∇ϕǫ = (γ1, γ2) + (b1, b2), where γj are
constants and bj = O(rθ+δ/2). The above commutator can be estimated by,

INVERSE SCATTERING FOR THE MAGNETIC SCHR ¨ODINGER OPERATOR

for small h and where C does not depend on ǫ. We thus see that (25) holds.
(cid:3)

To complete the proof of the previous Proposition we need to prove the

following Lemma.
Lemma 3.2. Let κ ≥ 0 and b(y) ∈ C ∞(R2) satisﬁes the estimate

Then we have the estimate

for u ∈ C ∞
Proof. Let a(ξ) := σ(hhDi−1) = hξi−1. The composition Oph(a) Oph(b) can
be written as follows

Oph(c)u = Oph(a) Oph(b)u = (2π)−2ZR2

eiy·ξc(y, hξ; h)ˆu(ξ) dξ,

where the symbol c can in turn be written in terms of oscillatory integrals,
as

K(z; h) :=ZR2

eiz·ξ/hK(z; h)b(y + z) dz,

e−iz·η/ha(η) dη.

We can split c by the Taylor Theorem as follows

c(y, ξ; h) = (2πh)−2ZR2

Here ∂jb(y) denotes the partial derivative of b with respect to the j-th vari-

One sees easily using the fact that1 ˆ1(η) = δ(η), that

c(y, ξ; h) = ab + (2πh)−2ZR2

eiz·ξ/hK(z; h)R1(y, z) dz.

1here δ is the Dirac delta function

INVERSE SCATTERING FOR THE MAGNETIC SCHR ¨ODINGER OPERATOR

A direct consequence of this is that

σ([Oph(a), Oph(b)]) = (2π)−2ZR2

eiz·ξK(hz; h)R1(y, hz) dz.

(27)

Deﬁne µ := h−1hyi1+κσ([Oph(a), Oph(b)]). We will now show that µ ∈
S −2. For this we need to check that condition (12) holds, with m = −2, i.e.
we need to show that

where Cβγ is independent of h. By the assumption on b and the form of K
it suﬃces show this for the case β = γ = 0.

Splitting the integral in (27) by the triangle inequality into two compo-
nents with the index j = 1, 2 and by integrating by parts, we see that we

(cid:3)

We can combine Proposition 3.4 and 3.1 to obtain a global estimate. To
handle the perturbed operator LX,V , we need to assume that potentials have
decay at least as fast as the weights on the L2-norms.
Lemma 3.3. Let ϕǫ be given by (10). Then for all V ∈ x1− δ
X ∈ x1− δ
for all 0 < h < h0, h ≪ ǫ < ǫ0 and u ∈ e−γ/xC ∞(M0), we have
√hkeϕǫ/h(LX,V − λ2)e−ϕǫ/hukH −1

2 W 1,∞(M0, T ∗M0) there exists an h0 > 0, ǫ0 and C > 0 such that

Ch

Proof. We ﬁrst consider only the case when X = 0 and V = 0. Let u ∈
e−γ/xC ∞(M0) and pick χ ∈ C ∞
0 (M0) such that χ = 1 on the compact set
containing all the critical points of ϕ and supp(1 − χ) is contained in the
ends. By Propositions 3.1 we have the following estimate for χu
ǫ (cid:0)√hkχukL2 + kdϕǫχukL2 + khd(χu)kH−1
scl(cid:1) ≤ keϕǫ/hh2(∆ − λ2)e−ϕǫ/hχukH−1
+ keϕǫ/h[h2∆, χ]e−ϕǫ/hukH−1
A limiting argument shows that Proposition 3.4 can be applied to smooth
function with exponential decay. Therefore, we have the following estimates
for (1 − χ)u
Ch
ǫ kx1−δ/2(1 − χ)ukL2 ≤ keϕǫ/hh2(∆ − λ2)e−ϕǫ/h(1 − χ)ukH−1

Adding these two inequalities together we obtain

keϕǫ/hh2(∆ − λ2)e−ϕǫ/hukH−1

scl(cid:1) ≤ (29)

.

The next step is to absorb the commutator term on the right-side. To this
end we ﬁrst observe that on the left-side

kx1−δ/2udϕǫkL2 ≤ kχudϕǫkL2 + kx1−δ/2(1 − χ)ukL2

while on the right-side

keϕǫ/h[h2∆, χ]e−ϕǫ/hukH −1

scl ≤ hk ˜χukL2

for some smooth cut-oﬀ ˜χ ∈ C ∞
0 (M0) which is equal to 1 on supp(dχ) but
supported away from the critical points of ϕ. These two inequalities allows

INVERSE SCATTERING FOR THE MAGNETIC SCHR ¨ODINGER OPERATOR

23

one to absorb the commutator term on the right-side of (29), when taking
ǫ > 0 small enough, to obtain

Ch

ǫ (cid:0)√hkx1−δ/2ukL2 + kx1−δ/2udϕǫkL2 + khd(χu)kH−1
scl(cid:1) ≤ keϕǫ/hh2(∆ − λ2)e−ϕǫ/hukH−1
We now replace the Laplacian by the more general operator LX,V . Observe
that LX,V − ∆ = 2hX, d·i + Q for some Q ∈ e−γ/xL∞ and the zeroth order
term can be absorbed to the left-side. Therefore
ǫ (cid:0)√hkx1−δ/2ukL2 + kx1−δ/2udϕǫkL2 + khd(χu)kH −1

Again we need to absorb the last term on the right-side. This is done by
ﬁrst observing that

scl

scl

scl

One sees then that the extra term can indeed be absorbed into the left-side
by taking ǫ > 0 small enough.
(cid:3)

We can utilize the above estimates to obtain an existence result, which is

needed when constructing the CGO solutions.

Lemma 3.4. Let δ ∈ (0, 1), V ∈ x1− δ
2 W 1,∞(M0, T ∗M0)
and ϕǫ as in (10). For all f ∈ L2(M0) and all h > 0 small enough, there
exists a solution u ∈ L2(M0) to the equation

2 L∞(M0), X ∈ x1− δ

(30)

satisfying

eϕǫ/h(LX,V − λ2)e−ϕǫ/hu = x1− δ
kukL2 + hkdukL2 ≤ C√hkfkL2.

2 f

Proof. Let L := eϕǫ/h(LX,V − λ2)e−ϕǫ/h and consider the linear space
Deﬁne a linear operator T : H → C by T (L∗v) := (cid:0)x1−δ/2v, f(cid:1)L2. Lemma

3.3 applies also to L∗, which shows that T is well deﬁned. Observe that
Dom(T ) is a linear subspace of H −1
scl (M0). By Lemma 3.3 again, one has
that

H := {L∗v | v ∈ C ∞

0 (M0)}.

|T (L∗v)| =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:0)x1−δ/2v, f(cid:1)L2(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ kx1−δ/2vkL2kfkL2 ≤ Cǫ√hkL∗vkH−1
The map T is hence bounded on the subspace H in the H −1
scl (M0) norm. By
the Hahn-Banach Theorem this map extends to a bounded linear functional
on H 1
scl with the same norm, which we still denote by T . By duality there
exists a u ∈ H 1
scl (M0) where
h·,·i denotes the duality between H 1
scl . Furthermore u satisﬁes the

scl(M0), such that T (w) = hu, wi for all w ∈ H −1

and this is precisely the statement that u is a weak solution of Lu = x1−δ/2f .
(cid:3)

Later we conjugate LX,V with an additional function FA, of the form
speciﬁed at the end of Section 5. The functions FA are in particular smooth
non-vanishing functions on M0, which has the expression FA = eiα(1 + t)
with α given by Proposition 2.2, t bounded uniformly away from −1 and in
the space e−γ/xW 1,∞(M0) for all γ > 0. The following Proposition gives a
solvability result in terms the additional conjugation.

Proposition 3.5. Let V ∈ x1− δ
let f ∈ xJ L2 for some J ∈ R. There exists solutions w ∈ H 1

keϕ0/ǫwkL2 + hkeϕ0/ǫdwkL2 ≤ C√hkx−J fkL2,

where ϕ0 is as required in deﬁnition (10).

Proof. By the assumption on the form of FA it suﬃces to show this for
FA = eiα. Let f ∈ xJ L2. Since FAe− Re(iα) is bounded and that eϕ0/ǫ
decays faster than any polynomial in x, we have that

e(ϕ−ϕǫ)/hFAf = FAe− Re(iα)eϕ0/ǫf ∈ x1− δ

2 L2(M0).

By Lemma 3.4 there is a solution u to the equation

e−ϕǫ/h(LX,V − λ2)eϕǫ/hu = e(ϕ−ϕǫ)/hFAeiψ/hf.

Deﬁne v := e(ϕǫ−ϕ)/hF −1

A u = eRe(iα)F −1

A e−ϕ0/ǫu. It follows that v solves

A (LX,V − λ2)eϕ/hFAv = eiψ/hf.
The norm estimate of Lemma 3.4 gives furthermore that

e−ϕ/hF −1

kukL2 + hkdukL2 ≤ C√hke(ϕ−ϕǫ)/hFAfkL2 ≤ C√hkx−J fkL2,

(33)

where the second inequality is obtained from the fact that multiplication
by e(ϕ−ϕǫ)/hFAxJ = FAe− Re(iα)eϕ0/ǫxJ ∈ L∞(M0) is L2-continuous on M0.
Next we estimate the right hand side of (33) from below. Firstly

kukL2 = kFAe− Re(iα)eϕ0/ǫvkL2 ≥ Ckeϕ0/ǫvkL2,

(34)
since eRe(iα)/FA ∈ L∞(M0). Expanding the derivative and use the assump-
tion that FA = eiα gives that

Since F −1

du = FAe− Re(iα)eϕ0/ǫ(cid:0)(dϕ0/ǫ − i Re(dα))v + dv(cid:1).

A eRe(iα) ∈ L∞(M0), we have that
kdukL2 ≥ C(cid:0)keϕ0/ǫdvkL2 − keϕ0/ǫ(cid:0)dϕ0/ǫ − i Re(dα)(cid:1)vkL2(cid:1)

≥ C(cid:0)keϕ0/ǫdvkL2 − keϕ0/ǫvkL2(cid:1),

25

where in the second step, we used that dϕ0/ǫ − i Re(dα) ∈ L∞(M0), which
holds because of (11) and because of the expression of α given in Proposition
2.2. This together with (34), gives

h−1keϕ0/ǫvkL2 + keϕ0/ǫdvkL2 ≤ C(h−1kukL2 + kdukL2 ),

(35)

when h is small. From (33) we get that

keϕ0/ǫvkL2 + hkeϕ0/ǫdvk2 ≤ C√hkx−J fkL2.

Finally setting w := e−iψ/hv, we see that w solves

e−Φ/hF −1

A (LX,V − λ2)eΦ/hFAw = f,

and that we have the estimate of the claim.

4. Scattering by LX,V on Surfaces with Euclidean Ends

In this section we construct the scattering matrix through the use of the
Poisson operator for the operator LX,V on surfaces with Euclidean ends.
Furthermore we will show that the range of the Poisson operator is dense in
some suitably deﬁned exponentially weighted solution spaces:
Proposition 4.1. There exists an operator PX,V (λ) : C ∞(∂M0) → x−τ H 1(M0)
satisfying for all f+ ∈ C ∞(∂M0) there exists a unique f− ∈ C ∞(∂M0) such
that
PX,V (λ)f+ − (x1/2eλ/xf+ + x1/2e−λ/xf−) ∈ L2(M0),
(LX,V − λ2)PX,V (λ)f+ = 0. (36)
We deﬁne the scattering matrix SX,V (λ) by SX,V (λ)f+ := f−.

Proposition 4.2. Let 0 < γ < γ′ < γ0.
e−γ0/xL∞ the set

If X ∈ e−γ0/xL∞ and V ∈

{PX,V (λ)f | f ∈ C ∞(∂M0)}

is dense in the null space of LX,V − λ2 in eγ/xL2 with respect to the eγ′/xL2
topology.

We ﬁrst deﬁne the free resolvent R0(λ) : L2 → H 2 on R2 for λ on the
lower half of the complex plane. If A > 0 then for all γ > A this resolvent
extends as a holomorphic family of operators R0(λ) : e−γ/xL2 → eγ/xH 2 as
λ vary over the set {λ | Im(λ) < A, λ /∈ iR+ ∪ 0}. Direct computation also
yields that for all τ > 1/2 one has R0(λ) : xτ L2 → x−τ H 2 when λ lies on
the positive real axis. This fact is usually stated in weighted L2 spaces but
the Sobolev estimate can be obtained by writing

(d∗d + 1)R0(λ) = Id + (λ2 + 1)R0(λ).

We generalize this statement for the operator LX,V on the surface M0:
Lemma 4.1. If A > 0 then for all γ > A the resolvent RX,V (λ) := (LX,V −
λ2)−1 is deﬁned as a meromorphic family of operators mapping e−γ/xL2 →
eγ/xL2 over the set {λ | Im(λ) < A, λ /∈ iR+ ∪ 0}. Furthermore, if λ ∈ R+
is not a pole of RX,V (λ) then it is a bounded map from xτ L2 → x−τ H 1 for
any τ > 1/2.

Proof. We let χ ∈ C ∞
0 (M0) be a smooth function such that 1−χ is supported
near Ej. We let χ0, χ1 ∈ C ∞
0 (M0) be smooth functions such that χ0 = 1
on the support of χ and 1 − χ1 = 1 on the support of 1 − χ. We observe
that if we chose λ0 to have a large negative imaginary part, then for the
parametrix

E(λ) := (1 − χ1)R0(λ)(1 − χ) + χ0R0(λ0)χ

we have (LX,V − λ2)E(λ) = I + K(λ) where K(λ) : xτ L2(M0) → xτ H 1(M0)
is given by
0)χ1)R0(λ0)χ−[∆g0 , χ0]R0(λ)(1−χ)+(X ♯+⋆dX+|X|2+V )E(λ)
K(λ) = ([∆g0 , χ1]−(λ2−λ2
and X ♯ denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to the vector ﬁeld obtained by
raising the index on the 1-form X. By the mapping properties of

R0(λ) : xτ L2(R2) → x−τ H 2(R2), R0(λ0) : L2(M0) → H 2(M0),

and the super-exponential rates of decay of X and V , we have that K(λ) is
a holomorphic family of compact operators from e−γ/xL2 to itself. If λ = λ0
has a large negative imaginary part, then I + K(λ) is invertible by Neumann
series. Therefore, by the analytic Fredholm theorem (I + K(λ))−1 is a
meromorphic family of operators from e−γ/xL2 to itself as λ varies over the
region {λ | Im(λ) < A, λ /∈ iR+ ∪ 0}. Setting RX,V (λ) := E(λ)(1 + K(λ))−1
proves the portion of the Lemma for the exponentially weighted L2 spaces.
For the resolvent acting on xτ L2, we need to show that 1 + K(λ) is
invertible on xτ L2 for τ > 1/2. Similar argument as before shows that K(λ)
is compact on xτ L2 and therefore the invertibility of 1 + K(λ) at a given
λ ∈ R+ can be deduced from the triviality of its null-space. Indeed, if λ
is not a pole of the resolvent RX,V (λ) acting on e−γ/xL2, then 1 + K(λ) is
invertible on e−γ/xL2. Suppose u ∈ xτ L2 is in the null-space of 1 + K(λ)
then it is actually an element of e−γ/xL2 by the decay properties of the
coeﬃcients in K(λ). As 1 + K(λ) is invertible on e−γ/xL2, we have that
u = 0. Therefore, RX,V (λ) = E(λ)(1 + K(λ))−1 is a resolvent mapping
xτ L2 → x−τ H 1 when λ ∈ R+ is not a pole.
(cid:3)

It is well-known ([20]) that for all f ∈ e−γ/xL2(R2) the free resolvent has

asymptotic given by

R0(λ)f − x1/2e−iλ/xv ∈ L2(R2)

for some smooth function v ∈ C ∞(S1). By the construction of E(λ) and
RX,V (λ) this gives the expansion
E(λ)f − x1/2e−iλ/xv ∈ L2(M0), RX,V (λ)f − x1/2e−iλ/xv′ ∈ L2(M0) (37)
for some v, v′ ∈ C ∞(∂M0).
the exposition of [20] we ﬁrst prove that

We would like to prove that the resolvent has no poles on R+. Following

Lemma 4.2. The poles of resolvent RX,V (λ), are precisely the values λ
for which there exists a nontrivial solution u ∈ x−τ H 1(M0) of the equation
(LX,V − λ2)u = 0 satisfying u − x1/2e−iλ/xv ∈ L2(M0) for some smooth
function v ∈ C ∞(∂M0).

INVERSE SCATTERING FOR THE MAGNETIC SCHR ¨ODINGER OPERATOR

27

Proof. If λ′ is a pole of RX,V (λ) then it must be a pole of (1 + K(λ))−1 as
the parametrix E(λ) is holomorphic. Therefore, there exists f ∈ e−γ/xL2
for which (1 + K(λ))−1f has a pole at λ′ with residue u′ ∈ e−γ/xL2. Using
the fact that (1 + K(λ))(1 + K(λ))−1f = f we have that u′ = −K(λ′)u′.
Therefore, if we set u := E(λ′)u′ then (LX,V − λ′2)u = (1 + K(λ′))u′ = 0
and the asymptotic of u can be derived from (37).

(cid:3)

We now show that the embedded eigenvalue obtained in Lemma 4.2 must

be trivial. To this end we ﬁrst derive the boundary pairing identity
Lemma 4.3. For λ > 0 and X, V ∈ e−γ/xL∞(M0), if u± ∈ x−τ H 1(M0) for
some τ > 1

2 and (LX,V − λ2)u± ∈ xτ L2(M0) with

u± − x1/2eiλ/xf±+ − x1/2e−iλ/xf±− ∈ L2(M0)

then we have the integral identity

h(LX,V − λ2)u+, u−i − hu+, (LX,V − λ2)u−i = 2iλZ∂M0
where the volume form on ∂M0 is induced by the metric x2g0 |T ∂M .
Proof. It suﬃces to prove this for ∆g0 in place of LX,V and use the fact
that LX,V − ∆g0 is a symmetric ﬁrst order diﬀerential operator with super-
exponential decaying coeﬃcients.

(f++ ¯f−+ − f+− ¯f−−)

If u± ∈ x−τ H 1 with (∆g0 − λ2)u± ∈ xτ L2 and

r± := u± − x1/2eiλ/xf±+ − x1/2e−iλ/xf±− ∈ L2(M0)

then one can deduce that r± ∈ H 2(M0). Therefore, if for ǫ > 0 small we
denote hf, gix>ǫ :=R{x>ǫ} f ¯gdvolg0, we have

h(∆g0 − λ2)u+, u−ix>ǫ − hu+, (∆g0 − λ2)u−ix>ǫ

Iǫ = 2iλR∂M0
(f++ ¯f−+ − f+− ¯f−−) with the volume form induced
where lim
ǫ→0
by the metric x2g0 |T ∂M0 and a± are L∞(M0) functions. As r± ∈ H 2(M0)
we can deduce that there exists a sequence of ǫj → 0 such that
Z{x=ǫ} |(a+(r+ + ∂νr+) + a−(r− + ∂ν r−))| ≤ ǫj.

Taking this sequence ǫj → 0 and use the fact that (u±)(∆g0 − λ2)u∓ ∈
L1(M0) by assumption allows us to arrive at the desired integral identity. (cid:3)

We are now in a position to show that the embedded function u =
x1/2eiλ/xv + L2(M0) constructed in Lemma 4.2 is trivial when λ ∈ R+ by
repeating an argument in [25]. Indeed, by setting u+ = u− = u in Lemma
4.3, we see that v = 0 and therefore u ∈ H 2(M0). Let χ ∈ C ∞
0 (M0) be
a smooth compactly supported function such that 1 − χ is only supported
in the Euclidean ends and deﬁne uχ := (1 − χ)u to be the H 2 function

deﬁned on the disjoint union of ﬁnitely many copies of R2. From the super-
exponential decay of the coeﬃcients of LX,V , we can use Paley-Weiner to
conclude that (|ξ|2 − λ2)ˆuχ extends to a holomorphic function g(ξ + iη) on
C2 which satisﬁes the bound

|η|≤γ kg(· + iη)kL2 ≤ Cγ,
sup

∀γ > 0.

The fact that ˆuχ ∈ L2 forces g to vanish on the real variety {ξ ∈ R2 |
ξ · ξ − λ2 = 0} and therefore vanish on the complex codimension one variety
{ζ ∈ C2 | ζ·ζ−λ2 = 0} (see proof of Lemma 2.5 [25]). One sees then that for
all multi-indices β with |β| ≤ 2 the function ξβ ˆuχ extends to a holomorphic
function on C2 which satisﬁes the bound

sup

|η|≤γ k(· + iη)β ˆuχ(· + iη)kL2 ≤ Cγ,

∀γ > 0.

Paley-Weiner then shows that u ∈ e−γ/xH 2(M0) for all γ > 0. Applying the
Carleman estimate in Proposition 3.3 shows that u = 0.
A direct consequence of this discussion in conjunction with Lemma 4.2

yields the following

Corollary 4.1. There does not exist nontrivial solutions to

(LX,V − λ2)u± = 0

of the form u± = x1/2e±iλ/xv± + L2(M0) for some v± ∈ C ∞(∂M0). Further-
more, the poles of the resolvent RX,V (λ) does not lie on the positive real
axis.

Proof of Proposition 4.1 We set

PX,V (λ) := (1 − χ)P0(λ) − RX,V (λ)(LX,V − λ2)(1 − χ)P0(λ)

where P0(λ) is the free Poisson kernel on R2. The asymptotic expansion
of the operator PX,V (λ) is then given by (37) and the expansion for P0(λ).
The uniqueness of the expansion in (36) comes from Corollary 4.1.
(cid:3)

We are now in a position to show that the range of the Poisson operator is
dense in the solution space of exponentially growing solutions.
Proof of Proposition 4.2 Let w ∈ e−γ′/xL2 be orthogonal to the range
of PX,V (λ) so that hw, PX,V (λ)f+i = 0 for all f+ ∈ C ∞(∂M0). We need to
show that hu, wi = 0 for all u ∈ eγ/xL2 such that (LX,V − λ2)u = 0.
To this end consider the function v := RX,V (λ)w = x1/2eiλ/xf + L2(M0)
for some f ∈ C ∞(∂M0). Applying integral identity in Lemma 4.3 with u+ =
PX,V (λ)f+ and u− = v we see that R∂M0
f+ ¯f = 0 for all f+ ∈ C ∞(∂M0).
This means that v is an L2 solution to (∆g0 − λ2)v ∈ e−γ′/xL2. If we choose
smooth cutoﬀ χ ∈ C ∞
0 (M0) such that 1−χ is only supported in the Euclidean
ends, this would mean that vχ := (1−χ)v ∈ L2 solves (∆−λ2)vχ ∈ e−γ′/xL2
in R2. Repeating the argument made in proving Corollary 4.1 we see that
vχ (and therefore v) is an element of e−γ′/xH 2.

Now let u ∈ eγ/xL2 such that (LX,V − λ2)u = 0. We may write
hw, ui = h(LX,V − λ2)RX,V (λ)w, ui = h(LX,V − λ2)v, ui = hv, (LX,V − λ2)ui = 0

where the integration-by-parts performed in the last step is permitted since
v ∈ e−γ′/xH 2 for some γ′ > γ > 0.

5. Boundary Identifiability at Infinity

Proposition 5.1. Let αj ∈ x−J H 4+ǫ0, 2 > J > 1, be solutions to ¯∂αj =
Aj := π0,1Xj ∈ e−γ/xH 3+ǫ0(M0) constructed in Proposition 2.2. Assum-
ing that SX1,V1(λ) = SX2,V2(λ), there exists a non-vanishing holomorphic
function Ψ satisfying

for all γ > 0.

Ψ − ei(α1−α2) ∈ e−γ/xH 3+ǫ0(M0)

(38)

We will split this into several Lemmas. In all of them we assume without

stating that SX1,V1(λ) = SX2,V2(λ).
Lemma 5.1. Let f ∈ H m

b (M0) be a function satisfying
¯∂f ∈ e−γ/xH m

b (M0;b T ∗

0,1M0)

J ∈ R,

for all γ > 0. Suppose f ∈ xJ H m
for all γ > 0.

b (M0) for all J ∈ R, then f ∈ e−γ/xH m

b (M0)

Proof By localizing f with cutoﬀ functions near the Euclidean ends Ej
and arguing each individual ends separately, we may assume without loss of
generality that M0 = C on which we use the standard variable z. Denote
by

u := ¯∂f ∈ e−γ|z|H m(C), ∀γ > 0.

(39)
It suﬃces to prove that f ∈ e−γ|z|L2(C) as the general Sobolev space
:= ∂xj f which satisﬁes ¯∂fj = ∂xj u ∈
result follows by considering fj
e−γ|z|H m−1(C).
Taking Fourier Transform of (39) we have that since f ∈ |z|−J H m for all

(ξ1 + iξ2) ˆf (ξ) = ˆu(ξ),

ˆf ∈ C ∞(R2)

(40)

which gives us a condition at the origin that will be useful later. By Paley-
Weiner ˆu(ξ) = ˆu(ξ1, ξ2) extends to be a holomorphic function on C2 of two
complex variables ˆu(ζ1, ζ2) with ζj = ξj + iηj ∈ C with ξj = Re(ζj) and
ηj = Im(ζj) (sometimes we write ˆu(ζ1, ζ2) = ˆu(ξ + iη)). Furthermore, it
satisﬁes, by (39) and Paley-Wiener,

sup

|η|≤γ kˆu(· + iη)k2

L2 < ∞ ∀γ ≥ 0.

(41)

We will prove that ˆu(ζ1, ζ2) has power series expansion around the origin

of the form

ˆu(ζ1, ζ2) =

∞Xj=1,k=0

cj,k(cid:0)ζ1 + iζ2(cid:1)j(ζ1 − iζ2(cid:1)k.

(42)

Notice that the index j starts at 1 rather than 0. If (42) holds then ˆf (ξ1, ξ2)
would by the removable singularities theorem have a holomorphic extension
onto C2 given by ˆu(ζ1,ζ2)
ζ1+iζ2

. (See e.g. Theorem 7.3.3 in [18]).

INVERSE SCATTERING FOR THE MAGNETIC SCHR ¨ODINGER OPERATOR

30

We proceed to show (42). By the fact that ˆu(ζ1, ζ2) is entire on C2 it has
a convergent power series expansion in powers of ζ1 and ζ2 which we can
write as

ˆu(ζ1, ζ2) =

cj,k(ζ1 + iζ2)j(ζ1 − iζ2)k.

∞Xj,k=0

Setting η1 = η2 = 0 so that ζj = ξj we have that, by denoting ξ = ξ1 + iξ2,

ˆu(ξ1, ξ2) =

∞Xj,k=0

cj,kξj ¯ξk.

We observe that (42) is equivalent to the fact that the above expansion has
c0,n = 0 for all n. To this end, (40) reads

ξ ˆf (ξ1, ξ2) =

∞Xj,k=0

cj,kξj ¯ξk

for ˆf smooth near the origin which immediately gives c0,0 = 0. Observe that
since ˆf is smooth, one can also divide by ξ to get the smooth function

ˆf (ξ1, ξ2) =

1
ξ

∞Xj,k=0

cj,kξj ¯ξk.

The right hand side is a-priori deﬁned only on the punctured plane but
extends smoothly to C due to the smoothness of ˆf . We will now hit both
sides with the operator ξ( ∂
∂ ¯ξ )n and take ξ → 0 to get 0 = c0,n for all n ≥ 1
and (42) is established.
It remains to apply Paley-Wiener to conclude the super-exponetially de-

cay of f . To do so, one needs to check

sup

|η|≤γ k ˆf (· + iη)k2

L2 < ∞,

∀γ ≥ 0.

On the strip |η| ≤ γ the vanishing set of ζ1 + iζ2 is contained in a compact
rectangle. On this rectangle ˆf (ζ1, ζ2) is of course bounded. Outside of this
rectangle the estimate comes from the fact that ˆf = ˆu
and the estimate
(41).

Lemma 5.2. Let f be a smooth function on M0 satisfying

¯∂f ∈ e−γ/xH m

b (M0;b T ∗

0,1M0) ∀γ > 0.

Suppose for all J ∈ R,

ZM0h ¯∂f, ηig0dvolg0 = 0,∀η ∈ x−J L2(M0; T ∗M0), ¯∂∗η = 0

(43)

(44)

then there exists a holomorphic function Ψ such that Ψ− f ∈ e−γ/xH m
for all γ > 0.

b (M0)

Proof We ﬁrst ﬁnd a solution U to the equation

¯∂U = − ¯∂f,

U ∈ xJ H m

b (M0) ∀J ∈ R.

Once such a solution is constructed, the proof is complete by evoking Lemma
5.1 to conclude that U belongs to e−γ/xH m
b (M0) for all γ > 0. To this end,

INVERSE SCATTERING FOR THE MAGNETIC SCHR ¨ODINGER OPERATOR

31

as ¯∂f decays super-exponentially, we may consider ¯∂f to be a xJ H m
b section
of bT ∗M0 for all J ∈ R and observe that by (4) it is an element of RJ,m( ¯∂)
if and only if

ZM0h ¯∂f, ηigbdvolgb = 0,∀η ∈ N−J,m(b ¯∂∗).

Using the relation (5) combined with the fact that

h ¯∂f, ηig0dvolg0 = h ¯∂f, ηigbdvolgb

Therefore for each J ∈ R\Z one can ﬁnd a solution UJ ∈ xJ H m

one sees that the condition given by (43) does indeed imply the above or-
thogonality condition for all J ∈ R.
b (M0) solv-
ing ¯∂UJ = − ¯∂f . Since the diﬀerence of two such solutions are holomorphic,
uniqueness follows for J /∈ Z large by standard arguments for holomorphic
for J ≥ J ′, there exists a unique
functions. Therefore, as xJ H m
solution U ∈ TJ∈R
xJ L2 of ¯∂U = − ¯∂f . This shows that (44) has a unique

solution and the proof is complete.

(cid:3)

By Lemma 5.2 we see that to prove Proposition 5.1 it suﬃces to show
that ei(α1−α2) satisﬁes the orthogonal condition (43). To this end we ﬁrst
derive the following identity:
Lemma 5.3. Let uj ∈ eγ/xH 1(M0) be solutions to LXj,Vj uj = 0 then the
integral identity holds

0 =ZM0

¯u1(A1 − A2) ∧ ∂u2 + ¯u1( ¯A1 − ¯A2) ∧ ¯∂u2 + ¯u1(Q1 − Q2)u2

Proof. By Lemma 4.3 and the fact that SX1,V1(λ) = SX2,V2(λ) we have that
the above identity holds for uj ∈ x−τ H 1(M0) in the range of PXj ,Vj (λ). We
ﬁrst ﬁx u2 and use the eγ/xL2 density result of Proposition 4.2 to take the
limit in u1 to conclude that the above identity holds for u2 in the range of
PX2,V2(λ) and solutions u1 ∈ eγ/xH 1(M0). Since now u1 has eγ/xH 1(M0)
regularity we can take the limit in u2 in the eγ/xL2 topology to obtain the
result.
(cid:3)

Proof of Proposition 5.1:
We begin by choosing Φ a holomorphic morse function which grows linearly
at each end; this function exists by Lemma 2.3. Let Crit(Φ) := {p0, . . . , pn}
be the critical points of Φ and, for some J ∈ R, let b ∈ xJ L2(M0) be an
antiholomorphic 1-form on M0 which vanishes to third order on points in
Crit(Φ). Consider the ansatz u0 = he ¯Φ/he−i ¯α2 b

¯∂ ¯Φ . By writing

for Q = |X|2 + V + dX ∈ e−γ/xL∞ for all γ ∈ R, we see that u0 solves

LX,V = e−i ¯α ¯∂∗|e−iα|2 ¯∂eiα + Q

(LX2,V2 − λ2)u0 = he

L2(M0) for some J ′ ∈ R. We now apply Proposition 3.5 to

with f ∈ xJ ′
obtain a solution to (LX2,V2 − λ2)u2 = 0 of the form
with r2 satisfying the estimate keϕ0/ǫr2k + hkeϕ0/ǫdr2k ≤ h√hCkx−J ′
fk
where ϕ0 is as required in deﬁnition (10). For the solution (LX1,V1 − λ2)u1 =
0 we use the ansatz

¯Φ/he−i ¯α2r2

u2 = u0 + e

(LX1,V1 − λ2)eΦ/he−iα1 = eΦ/he−iα1 f

with f ∈ xJ L2 for some J ∈ R. Proposition 3.5 again applies to obtain a
solution to (LX1,V1 − λ2)u1 = 0 of the form
with r1 satisfying the estimate keϕ0/ǫr1k+hkeϕ0/ǫdr1k ≤ √hCkx−J fk where

u1 = eΦ/he−iα1 + eΦ/he−iα1r1.

ϕ0 is as required in deﬁnition (10).

We now substitute these solutions into the identity in Lemma 5.3 to ob-

tain, after taking h → 0,

0 =ZM0h ¯∂ei(α1−α2), bidvolg0

for all anti-holomoprhic 1-forms b vanishing to third order at Crit(Φ) =
{p0, . . . , pn} which are in the space xJ L2(M0) for some J ∈ R.
We do not have the orthogonal condition (43) for all anti-holomorphic
1-forms yet because of the restricted vanishing condition. We will get rid of
the vanishing condition one point at a time starting with p0. To this end, we
use Lemma 2.1 and Corollary 2.1 to construct a holomorphic Morse function
˜Φ for which p0 /∈ Crit( ˜Φ) := {˜p0, . . . , ˜pm}. Repeating the above argument
for ˜Φ we have that

0 =ZM0h ¯∂ei(α1−α2), ˜bidvolg0

for all anti-holomoprhic 1-forms ˜b vanishing to third order at

Let b ∈ xJ L2(M0) for some J ∈ R be an antiholomorphic 1-form which
vanishes at {p1, . . . , pn}. By Lemma 2.4, it can be written as the sum
(b − ˜b) + ˜b where (b − ˜b) ∈ x ˜J L2(M0) vanishes to third order at {p0, . . . , pn}
and ˜b ∈ x ˜J L2(M0) vanishes to third order at {˜p0, . . . , ˜pm}. Linearity then

implies that

0 =ZM0h ¯∂ei(α1−α2), bidvolg0

for all antiholomorphic 1-forms b ∈ xJ L2(M0) vanishing to third order at
{p1, . . . , pn}. Proceeding as such for the points p1, . . . , pn we can remove
all the vanishing conditions placed upon b and the orthogonality condition
(43) holds for all antiholomorphic 1-forms. The existence of Ψ satisfying
the asymptotic condition (38) is thus proven by evoking Lemma 5.2 and
b (M0) for all γ > 0 iﬀ U ∈ e−γ/xH m(M0) for all
observing that U ∈ e−γ/xH m
γ > 0.

To see that the holomorphic function Ψ is non-vanishing, we interchange
the indices to deduce that there exists holomorphic functions Ψ1,2 and Ψ2,1
on M0 which satisﬁes condition (38) for ei(α1−α2) and ei(α2−α1) respectively.
Considering the product Ψ1,2Ψ2,1 and using condition (38) we see that the
product is actually the constant function 1.
(cid:3)

If αj are the functions constructed in Proposition 2.2, it is convenient
make the deﬁnition FA1 := eiα1 and FA2 := Ψeiα2 where Ψ is the holomor-
phic function constructed in Proposition 5.1. Following the construction of
Ψ and using the fact that H 3+ǫ0(M0) ⊂ W 2,∞(M0) one has the following
useful expression for FA2
Lemma 5.4. We have that FA2 = eiα1 (1 + t) with t bounded uniformly
away from −1 and belongs to the space e−γ/xW 2,∞(M0) for all γ > 0.

6. Construction of CGO Solutions

We construct special solutions to (LX,V − λ2)u = 0. To this end it is con-
venient to write the diﬀerential operator in terms ¯∂ and its adjoint. Namely,
if α is a function such that ¯∂α = A then one can write
LX,V = e−i ¯α ¯∂∗|e−iα|2 ¯∂eiα + Q

for Q = |X|2 + V + dX ∈ e−γ/xL∞ for all γ ∈ R. We would like to study
the existence of such functions α with suitable behaviour near the ends.
If M0 is a surface with N Euclidean ends, consider its N point compact-
iﬁcation M by adding the points {e1, . . . , eN} at the ends. Around each ej
introduce holomorphic coordinate z and write z = xeiθ.

6.1. Constructing CGO of Type I. We are now in a position to construct
a family CGO which will be useful for recovering interior information. Let b
0,1M belonging to Ker( ¯∂∗) with poles contained in the set
be a section of T ∗
{e1, . . . , eN} and Φ = φ + iψ be a morse holomorphic function on M0 with
poles of the form Cj
z near ej, Cj 6= 0. Let FA be a smooth function on M0
which satisﬁes FA − eiα ∈ e−γ/xW 2,∞(M0) for all γ > 0. If χ ∈ C ∞
0 (M0)
is a cutoﬀ function which is 1 near all the critical points of Φ, consider the
ansatz

u0 = eΦ/hF −1
A

¯∂−1
J (e−2iψ/hχ|FA|2b) − h(1 − χ)e
for 2 > J > 1. Here we use the notation (1 − χ) b
satisfying ¯∂ψ(1 − χ) b
points on the support of (1 − χ).

¯∂ψ to denote the function
¯∂ψ = (1 − χ)b. It is well-deﬁned since ψ has no critical

for some J ′ > 0 and 2 > J > 1. By Proposition 3.5 we can solve for
the remainder r so that (LX,V − λ2)(u0 + eϕ/hr) = 0 with r satisfying the
estimate ke−γ0/xrk + hke−γ0/xdrk ≤ Ch1+ǫ for some γ0 > 0. We summarize
this discussion in the following Proposition.
Proposition 6.1. There exists solutions to (LX,V − λ2)u = 0 of the form
u = u0 + eφ/hr where u0 is given by (45) and r satisﬁes the estimate

for some γ0 > 0.

ke−γ0/xrk + hke−γ0/xdrk ≤ Ch1+ǫ

6.2. Constructing CGO of Type II. Let Φ = φ + iψ be a holomorphic

Morse function which has critical points {p0, . . . , pn} and expansion Φ = Cj
for Cj 6= 0 near the ends ej for j = 1, . . . , N . Let a be a holomorphic function
in x−J L2(M0) for some J ∈ R+\Z and which vanishes at {p1, . . . , pn} but
does not vanish at p0. We see then that

z

(LX,V − λ2)eΦ/he−iαa = (Q − λ2)eΦ/he−iαa

and this motivates us to seek r1 solving

(LX,V − λ2)eΦ/hr1 = −(Q − λ2)eΦ/he−iαa + eΦ/he−iαOx−J L2(h|logh|).

To this end, let G be the operator of Lemma 2.6, mapping continuously
x−J+1L2(M0) to x−J−1L2(M0). Then clearly ∂∗∂G = Id when acting on
x−J+1L2.

First, we will search for r1 satisfying
e−2iψ/h|eiα|2∂ei ¯αe2iψ/hr1 = −∂G(a(Q − λ2)) + ω + Ox−J H 1(h| log h|) (47)
with ω ∈ x−J L2(M0) a holomorphic 1-form on M0 and kr1kx−J L2 = O(h).
Indeed, using the fact that Φ is holomorphic we have

e−Φ/h(LX,V − λ2)eΦ/h = e−iα∂∗e−2iψ/h|eiα|2∂ei ¯αe2iψ/h + ¯Q − λ2

for some smooth superexponentially decaying function Q and applying e−iα∂∗
to (47), this gives

e−Φ/h(LX,V − λ2)eΦ/hr1 = −ae−iα(Q − λ2) + e−iαOx−J L2(h| log h|).

Writing −∂G(a(Q − λ2)) =: c(z)dz in local complex coordinates, c(z) is
C 2,γ by elliptic regularity and we have 2i∂¯zc(z) = a(Q − λ2), therefore
¯z c(p′) = 0 at each critical point p′ 6= p0 by construction of the
∂z∂¯zc(p′) = ∂2
function a. Therefore, we deduce that at each critical point p′ 6= p0, c(z) has
Taylor series expansion P2
j=0 cjzj + O(|z|2+γ ). That is, all the lower order
terms of the Taylor expansion of c(z)
around p′ are polynomials of z only. By Lemma 2.5, and possibly by
taking J larger, there exists a holomorphic function f ∈ x−J L2 such that
ω := ∂f has Taylor expansion equal to that of ∂G(a(Q − λ2)) at all critical
points p′ 6= p0 of Φ. We deduce that, if β := −∂G(a(Q − λ2)) + ω = β(z)dz,
we have
|∂m
for ℓ + m ≤ 2, at critical points p′ 6= p0
¯z ∂ℓ

zβ(z)| = O(|z|2+γ−ℓ−m),
|β(z)| = O(|z|),

if p′ = p0.

(48)

INVERSE SCATTERING FOR THE MAGNETIC SCHR ¨ODINGER OPERATOR

35

Now, we let χ1 ∈ C ∞
0 (M0) be a cutoﬀ function supported in a small neigh-
bourhood Up0 of the critical point p0 and identically 1 near p0, and χ ∈
C ∞
0 (M0) is deﬁned similarly with χ = 1 on the support of χ1. We will
construct r1 to be a sum r1 = r11 + hr12 where r11 is a compactly supported
approximate solution of (47) near the critical point p0 of Φ and r12 is correc-
tion term supported away from p0. We deﬁne locally in complex coordinates
centered at p0 and containing the support of χ

r11 := χe−2iψ/he−i ¯αR(|eiα|−2|e2iψ/hχ1β)

where Rf (z) := −(2πi)−1RR2

(49)
¯z− ¯ξ f d¯ξ ∧ dξ for f ∈ L∞ compactly supported
is the classical Cauchy operator inverting locally ∂z (r11 is extended by 0
outside the neighbourhood of p). The function r11 is in C 3,γ(M0) and we
have

1

e−2iψ/h|eiα|2∂(e2iψ/hei ¯αr11) = χ1(−∂G(a(Q − λ2)) + ω) + η

with η := e−2iψ/he−i ¯αR(|eiα|−2e2iψ/hχ1β)∂χ.

(50)

We then construct r12 by observing that b vanishes to order 2 + γ at critical
points of Φ other than p0 (from (48)), and ∂χ = 0 in a neighbourhood of
any critical point of ψ, so we can ﬁnd r12 satisfying
2ieiαr12∂ψ = (1 − χ1)β.

(51)

This is possible since both ∂ψ and the right hand side are valued in T ∗
1,0M0
and ∂ψ has ﬁnitely many isolated zeroes on M0: r12 is then a function which
is in C 2,γ(M0 \ P ) where P := {p1, . . . , pn} is the set of critical points other
than p0, it extends to a function in C 1,γ(M0) and it satisﬁes in local complex
coordinates z at each pj, j = 1, . . . , n

|∂j
¯z ∂k

z r12(z)| ≤ C|z|1+γ−j−k,

j + k ≤ 2

by using also the fact that ∂ψ can be locally be considered as a smooth
function with a zero of order 1 at each pj. Moreover β ∈ x−J H 2(M0) thus
r1 ∈ x−J H 2(M0) and we have
e−2iψ/h|eiα|2∂(ei ¯αe2iψ/hr1) = −∂G(a(Q − λ2)) + ω + h|eiα|2∂ei ¯αr12 + η.
Lemma 6.1. The following estimates hold true
||η||H 2(M0) = O(| log h|), kηkH 1(M0) ≤ O(h| log h|), ||xJ ∂r12||H 1(M0) = O(1),

||xJ eiαr1||L2 = O(h), ||xJ eiα(r1 − her12)||L2 = o(h)

where er12 solves 2ieiαer12∂ψ = β.

Proof. The proof is exactly the same as the proof of Lemma 4.2 in [10],
except that one needs to add the weight xJ to have bounded integrals. (cid:3)

As a direct consequence, we have

Corollary 6.1. With r1 = r11 + hr12, there exists J > 0 such that
||eiαe−Φ/h(LX,V − λ2)eΦ/h(a + r1)||x−J L2(M0) = O(h| log h|).

INVERSE SCATTERING FOR THE MAGNETIC SCHR ¨ODINGER OPERATOR

Now we can apply Proposition 3.5 to obtain solutions to (LX,V −λ2)u = 0

of the form

u = eΦ/h(a + r1) + eϕ/hr2

(52)

with r2 satisfying the estimates

ke−γ0/xr2k + hke−γ0/xdr2k ≤ Ch1+ 1

2| log h|

for some γ0 > 0.

7. Conjugation Factors and an Integral Identity

We begin by deﬁning the functions FA1 and FA2 as

FA1 := eiα1

and

FA2 := Ψeiα2,

(53)

where αj are the soultions to ¯∂αj = Aj, given by Proposition 2.2 and where
Ψ is the holomorphic function given by Proposition 5.1 so that FA2 has the
expression given by Lemma 5.4

We proceed by ﬁrst deriving an apropriate system and from this an inte-

gral identity. Consider the equation

(LXj ,Vj − λ2)uj = 0,

on M0,

(54)

j = 1, 2. This equation can rewritten by means of the above deﬁntions in
the form

where Qj := ⋆dXj + Vj. Using this and by deﬁning the function and 1-form

on sees that equation (54) is then equvivalent to the system

(D + Aj)Uj = 0,

on M0.

In order to derive the integral identity we deﬁne an exhaustion of M0,
given by the sets MR := ˜M ∪ ˜E1,R ∪ ··· ∪ ˜EN,R, where ˜M \ ∪jEj and
˜Ej,R ≃ B(0, R)\B(0, 1), R > 1. Consider the solutions Uj of (D+Aj)Uj = 0,
j = 1, 2. Letting W := U1 − U2, we have that

ZMR(cid:10)(D + A1)W, U1(cid:11) =ZMR(cid:10)(A2 − A1)U2, U1(cid:11),

where hU1, U2i := h˜u1, ˜u2i + h˜ω1, ˜ω2i where inner products on the right side
are the ones induced by the metric. By integrating by parts the left hand
side and using the fact that (D − A1)U1 = 0, we have that

ZMR(cid:10)(A2 − A1)U2, U1(cid:11) =Z∂MR

ι∗(cid:0)(˜u1 − ˜u2) ⋆ ˜ω1 − ⋆(˜ω1 − ˜ω2)˜u1(cid:1),

(55)

INVERSE SCATTERING FOR THE MAGNETIC SCHR ¨ODINGER OPERATOR

37

We now let uj ∈ x−τ L2, τ > 1

where ι : ∂MR → M0 is the inclusion map. The boundary ∂MR can be
decomposed into components that are contained in the ends Ej. The in-
tegration set ∂MR can moreover be considered to consist of the set {z ∈
C : |z| = R} in each end.
2 be the scattering solutions given by means
of the Poisson operator, i.e. uj = Pj(λ)g, where g ∈ C ∞(∂M0) and consider
how the boundary integral in (55) behaves, when R → ∞. By Proposition
4.1 we have the following asymptotics for the scattering solutions,
2 [eiλr(SXj,Vj (λ)g)(θ)) + ie−iλrg(θ)] + R,

uj = Pj(λ)g = cλr− 1

where z = reiθ and |R| + |∇R| ≤ Cr− 3

2 .

To see that the boundary integral in (55) vanishes in the limit, we ﬁrstly

note that

(˜u1 − ˜u2)˜ω1 = (FA1 u1 − FA2u2)˜ω1 = (FA1 (u1 − u2) + (FA1 − FA2)u2)˜ω1

The term containing FA1 − FA2 decays super exponentially thanks to Propo-
sition 5.1 and will therefore not contribute to the integral in (55) in the limit.
We have moreover that

FA1(u1 − u2)˜ω1 = FA1(u1 − u2)|FA1|−2(FA1 ∂u1 + u1∂FA1 )

= (u1 − u2)∂u1 + O(e−r).

The scattering matricies are equal for the potentials,
i.e. SX1,V1(λ)g =
SX2,V,2(λ)g. This together with the above asymptotics for uj imply that the
above expression is O(r−3/2). It follows the last term in the integral in (55)
vanishes in the limit R → ∞.
the derivative has the expansion

To handle the ˜ω1 − ˜ω2 term in (55), we argue similarly. First note that

¯∂uj = cλr− 1

2 [iλeiλrSXj ,Vj (λ)g(θ)) + λe−iλrg(θ)] + O(r− 3

2 ).

Secondly we have that

¯∂u2 −

It follows that

FA1
|FA1|2

¯∂uj + O(e−r),

˜ωj = |FAj|−2 ¯∂FAj uj − |FAj|−2FAj
(˜ω1 − ˜ω2)˜u1 =(cid:16) FA2

¯∂uj = −|FAj|−2FAj

=(cid:0)(F A1 − F A2) ¯∂u2 + F A2( ¯∂u2 − ¯∂u1)(cid:1) FA2

|FA2|2 u1 + O(e−r),
the ﬁrst term decays super exponentially by Proposition 5.1. In the second
term the FA2:s cancel, and we can thus use the asymptotics of ¯∂uj together
with the fact that SX1,V1(λ)g = SX2,V,2(λ)g to see that it is O(r−3/2). This
implies that the integral containing the ˜ω1 − ˜ω2 term in (55), will vanish,
when R → ∞.

By taking the limit R → ∞ in (55) we obtain hence that

ZM0(cid:10)(A2 − A1)U2, U1(cid:11) = 0,

(56)

when U1 and U2 are made up of scattering solutions. As a consequence of
the density result of Proposition 4.2 we can extend this to all exponentially
growing solutions of (54), which is the content of the following Lemma.
Lemma 7.1. Assume that SX1,V1(λ)g = SX2,V,2(λ)g. Let v, w ∈ eγ/xH 1(M0)
for some γ > 0, be solutions of (LX1,V1 − λ2)v = 0 and (LX2,V2 − λ2)w = 0,
on M0, then
ZM0(cid:10)(|FA1|−2 − |FA2|−2) ¯∂˜v, ¯∂ ˜w(cid:11) +
2(cid:10)(Q1|FA1|2 − Q2|FA2|2)˜v, ˜w(cid:11) = 0,
Proof. Proposition 4.2 implies that we can pick two sequences of scattering
solutions (vk) and (wk), s.t. vk → v, and wk → w in the eγ′/xL2-norm. It
follows that ˜vk → ˜v, and ˜wk → ˜w in the eγ′/xL2-norm and moreover that
¯∂˜vk → ¯∂˜v, and ¯∂ ˜wk → ¯∂ ˜w in the eγ′/xH −1-norm.
Use the abbreviations µF := |FA1|−2 − |FA2|−2 ∈ e−γ/xW 1,∞(M0) and
µQ := 1
2 (Q1|FA1|2 − Q2|FA2|2) ∈ e−γ/xW 1,∞(M0). Now suppose ﬁrst that
u is a scattering solution to (LX2,V2 − λ2)u = 0. Since the claim holds for
scattering solutions, because of (56) we have that
ZM0(cid:10)µF ¯∂˜v, ¯∂ ˜u(cid:11) +(cid:10)MQ˜v, ˜u(cid:11) =ZM0(cid:10)µF ¯∂(˜v − ˜vk), ¯∂ ˜u(cid:11) +(cid:10)µQ(˜v − ˜vk), ˜u(cid:11)
ZM0(cid:10)µQ(˜v − ˜vk), ˜u(cid:11) ≤ keγ′/xµQkL∞ke−γ′/x(˜v − ˜vk)kL2k˜ukL2 → 0,

We can estimate the term involving µQ by

(58)

(57)

as k → ∞. To handle the other term in (57) we write
(cid:10)µF ¯∂(˜v − ˜vk), ¯∂ ˜u(cid:11) = (|FA1|−2 − |FA2|−2)FA1 F A2

(iA1(v − vk) − ¯∂(v − vk))(−iA2 ¯u − ∂ ¯u).

Furthermore we have that

Proposition 5.1 implies that µ is super exponentially decaying. To estimate
the ﬁrst term on the right hand side of (57) we write

µ := (|FA1|−2 − |FA2|−2)FA1 F A2 =(cid:0)(FA2 − FA1 )F A2 + FA1 (F A2 − F A1)(cid:1)/FA2 F A1.
ZM0(cid:10)µF ¯∂(˜v − ˜vk), ¯∂ ˜u(cid:11) =ZM0

µ(iA1(v − vk) − ¯∂(v − vk))(−iA2 ¯u − ∂ ¯u)

+ kµ ¯∂(v − vk)kH −1kA2 ¯ukH 1

→ 0,

as k → ∞, where we used the fact that u ∈ x−αH 2(M0), α > 0 by elliptic
regularity. It follows

ZM0(cid:10)µF ¯∂˜v, ¯∂ ˜u(cid:11) +(cid:10)µQ˜v, ˜u(cid:11) = 0.

(59)

We can now repeat this form of argument to obtain the above equation with
the scattering solution u replaced by w, thus proving the claim.

8. Gauge equivalence

The goal of this section is to prove the gauge equivalence statement of

Theorem 1.1:
Proposition 8.1. If SX1,V1(λ) = SX2,V,2(λ) for a ﬁxed λ ∈ R\{0} then
there exists a unitary function Θ such that X1 − X2 = dΘ/Θ.

Let Φ = ϕ + iψ be a Morse holomorphic function given by Lemma 2.1
and Corollary 2.1, and let {p0, . . . , pn} be its critical points. Let b be an
antiholomorphic 1-form chosen so that

b(p1) = ··· = b(pn) = 0,

b(p0) 6= 0.

(60)

Such antiholomrphic 1-forms are given by Lemma 2.4. Proposition 6.1 gives
uj, j = 1, 2 solving (LXj,Vj − λ2)uj = 0, and are of the form
u2 := u0,2 + e−ϕ/hr2

u1 := u0,1 + eϕ/hr1,

where u0,j is given by (45) where u0,1 is constructed with phase Φ while u0,2
is constructed with phase −Φ.

Let ˜uj := FAj uj and direct computation shows that
¯∂ ˜uj = ¯∂(FAj uj ) = e(−1)j−1 ¯Φ/h|FAj|2b + he(−1)j−1 ¯Φ/h|FAj|2R0,j + ¯∂(FAj e(−1)j−1ϕ/hr)

(61)

(62)

where R0,j ∈ eγ0/xW 1,∞(M0) for some γ0 > 0.
Plugging in the expression (61) into the identity given by Lemma 7.1 we
obtain

Note that Lemma 5.4 ensures (|FA1|2 − |FA2|2) ∈ e−γ/xW 1,∞(M0) for all γ > 0.

We need to show that everything on the right-side of (62) is o(h) except the
(|FA1|2 − |FA2|2)e−2iψ/h|b|2. This comes by direct computation
using stationary phase for terms not involving ¯∂(FAj e±ϕ/hrj). For terms which has
the same form as

¯Φ/hb,|FA2|−2 ¯∂(FA2 e−ϕ/hr2)i

(|FA1|2 − |FA2|2)he

we can take advantage of the super-exponential decay of (|FA1|2 − |FA2|2) and
integrate-by-parts

This can now be estimated using the bound for the remainder r2 stated in Propo-
sition 6.1 and is of order o(h).

For the term

we can again integrate-by-parts to move all the derivatives to terms involving r2:

+ ke−φ/h(LX2,V2 − λ2)u0,2keγ0 /xL2 )
≤ o(1)

and we see therefore that (63) is o(h). We can conclude then that (62) indeed
becomes

ZM0

(|FA1|2 − |FA2|2)e2iψ/h|b|2 = o(h).

(64)

We are now in a position to prove
Lemma 8.1. If SX1,V1(λ) = SX2,V,2(λ) for a ﬁxed λ ∈ R\{0} then for FA1 and
FA2 chosen as in (53) one has |FA1| = |FA2|.
Proof. Let p0 ∈ M0 the critical point of a Morse meromorphic function Φ = ϕ + iψ
on M0∪{e1, . . . , eN} whose (non-removable) poles are all simple and form precisely
the set {e1, . . . , eN}. From Proposition 2.1 we know that such points form a dense
subset of M0. If {p0, . . . , pn} are the critical points of Φ, choose antiholomorphic
1-form b satisfying condition (60) and apply stationary phase expansion to (64) we
see that |FA1 (p0)| = |FA2 (p0)|. Since p0 can be chosen over an dense subset of M0,
the continuity of FAj completes the proof.

This Lemma leads immediate to the

Proof of Proposition 8.1 By Lemma 8.1 we can deﬁne the unitary function
Θ := FA1
. Note that due to Lemma 5.4, Θ ∈ 1 + e−γ/xW 1,∞(M0) for all
FA2
γ > 0. We see that ¯∂Θ = iπ0,1(X1 − X2)/Θ while ∂Θ = iπ1,0(X1 − X2)/Θ. Adding
the two identities together we obtain Proposition 8.1.

9. Determining the Zeroth order term

In this section we complete the proof of Theorem 1.1 by proving

Proposition 9.1. If SX1,V1(λ) = SX2,V,2(λ) for a ﬁxed λ ∈ R\{0} then V1 = V2.
This will be accomplished with CGO of type II given by (65). To this end, let

u1 and u2 be solutions of the from (65) with phase Φ and −Φ respectively:

u1 = eΦ/h(a + r1) + eϕ/hr2,

u2 = e−Φ/h(a + s1) + e−ϕ/hs2

with r2 and s2 satisfying the estimates

ke−γ0/xr2k + hke−γ0/xdr2k + ke−γ0/xs2k + hke−γ0/xds2k ≤ Ch1+ 1

2| log h|

for some γ0 > 0.

Note that since we have already shown in Proposition 8.1 that X1 and X2 are
gauge equivalent, we may assume without loss of generality that they are actually

identical. Therefore, for the CGO u1 and u2, the identity in Lemma 7.1 holds with
FA1 = FA2 = FA = eiα to become

0 =ZM0(cid:12)(cid:12)FA|2h(Q1 − Q2)˜u1, ˜u2(cid:11) =ZM0(cid:12)(cid:12)FA|4h(Q1 − Q2)u1, u2(cid:11)

where ˜uj = FAuj and Qj = ∗dXj + Vj. We now plug in the expression for u1 and
u2 into this identity. Using Lemma 6.1 and elementary estimates we obtain

o(h) =ZM0

e2iψ/h(Q1 − Q2)|a|2

Repeating the same argument as in proof of Lemma 8.1 we have that Q1 = Q2 on
M0 which implies that V1 = V2 and Proposition 9.1 is veriﬁed.
