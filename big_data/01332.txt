We explore a model of gravity that arises from the consideration of the Chern-Simons form in
2+1 dimensions for a spin connection with a contorsion described by a scalar and a vector ﬁeld.
The eﬀective Lagrangian presents a local Weyl symmetry allowing us to gauge the scalar ﬁeld to a
constant value. From a gauge ﬁeld theory perspective, it is shown that the vector part of the torsion
(related to its trace) is a gauge ﬁeld for the Weyl group, which allows the interpretation of the torsion
as an electromagnetic ﬁeld. In the gauge of constant scalar ﬁeld we obtain Chiral Gravity coupled to
a Chern-Simons-Proca theory for the vector ﬁeld, that at the level of equations of motion is equivalent
to Topologically Massive Electrodynamics minimally coupled to Chiral Gravity. Electrodynamics
and gravity appear here uniﬁed as geometrical features of a Riemann-Cartan manifold.

INTRODUCTION

Ordinary Einstein gravity is trivial in 2+1 dimensions
on the grounds that it does not present propagating de-
grees of freedom. However, in the case of negative cosmo-
logical constant there are asymptotically AdS3 black hole
solutions [1], that resemble all the characteristic features
of real black hole solutions for four dimensional theories.
Even though the theory from which originally these solu-
tions arose is still considered too simple, they have been
proven to provide a good tool to understand the physics
of these entities in a very simple model, since they follow
the known thermodynamic laws of black holes, having an
entropy of a fourth of the horizon area. The question of
how to interpret the microscopic origin of this entropy
in such a trivial theory led to consider further theoret-
ical gravity frameworks in which these solutions exist.
In the case of topologically massive gauge theories [2],
the usual gauge invariant Lagrangian is augmented by a
term of topological origin related to the Chern-Simons
(CS) secondary characteristic classes [3]. This term adds
a propagating massive degree of freedom in the case of
second-rank tensor ﬁelds describing gravity, whereas that
for an Abelian vector ﬁeld the model posses a single mas-
sive spin 1 mode in contrast to the single massless spin 0
mode of the original Maxwell theory in 2+1 dimensions.
The former is referred to as Topologically Massive Grav-
ity (TMG) whereas the latter as Topologically Massive
Electrodynamics (TME). Large literature has been writ-
ten about these models, see for instance [2, 4].
TMG accepts the factorization as a Chern-Simons La-
grangian for the SL(2, R)L×SL(2, R)R group for a pair of
1-form connections, reminiscent of the famous Ach´ucaro-
Townsend-Witten formulation of Einstein gravity [5].
The coeﬃcients of the TMG action (1) are the central
charges of the dual CFT of the left and right components

cL/R. For a particular election of coupling constants,
namely when the graviton mass, µ, equals the inverse
of the curvature radius of AdS3, µl = 1, the left central
charge of the boundary CFT dual become zero and seems
to be dual to a holomorphic (chiral) CFT2. This was
proposed in [6] by Li, Song and Strominger who argued
inconsistency of TMG for generic coupling constants ex-
cept for this particular (chiral) point of the parameters
space, known as Chiral Gravity (CG). Provided bound-
ary conditions, CG may represent a consistent quantum
theory of gravity for AdS3 spacetimes [7], although some
question are still open, among others, how to generalize
CG to couple matter ﬁelds and local degrees of freedom.
It was shown in [8] that CG can be thought as a La-
grangian for a spin connection of a Riemann-Cartan (RC)
manifold of constant antisymmetric torsion. The inverse
of AdS3 radius, l−1, in this work was promoted to a scalar
ﬁeld, adding a degree of freedom to the theory, that when
acquires a constant value reproduces the gauge connec-
tion A ab upon which CG is constructed (see section II).
This allows the theory to develop dynamics for the scalar
ﬁeld, that couples non minimally to geometry. The mini-
mal extension to that model motivates this investigation.
The question of how to incorporate more torsional de-
grees of freedom in the picture, in order to understand
more fundamentally the properties of its behaviour and
what kind of matter will arise in this procedure is here ad-
dressed. We include the next irreducible part in the usual
torsional decomposition, namely its trace A ∼ ιaT a1. Is
tempting to interpret this components of torsion as an ef-
fective kind of matter. Models in the literature propose
the same idea [9–11]. One of the goals of this investiga-
tion is to explore this notion about torsion.
The paper is organized as follows: Section II motivates
our model by explaining the Chern-Simons decomposi-
tion of TMG and how we add torsional degrees of free-
dom from it. It also shows the eﬀective theory we will

try present in the model, and explains how the trace of
torsion can be understood as a gauge ﬁeld for this sym-
metry. The details of the equations of motion and the
relation of our model with TME is explained in section
IV. Conclusions and remarks are given next, in section

degrees of freedom in the model. Indeed it is also related
to the Riemannian one by simply

ωab = ˜ωab + κab,

(3)

where κab is the contorsion 1-form, which carries the tor-
sional degrees of freedom. In fact we see from here that,
since ˜ω still satisﬁes (2),

II. CHIRAL GRAVITY AND

LORENTZ-CHERN-SIMONS THEORY

Let ˜ωab be a Riemannian spin connection 1-form that
describes the aﬃne structure of a three dimensional man-
ifold. Let ea = ea
µdxµ be the dreibein 1-form that de-
ﬁnes the metric structure of the same manifold by the
relation gµν = ea
ν ηab. The dreibein is the mapping
that relates Greek characters (coordinate indices) with
the Latin ones (Lorentz indices). In our convention the
ﬂat Lorentzian metric will be ηab = diag (−, +, +). The
cosmological TMG action accepts the following factoriza-
tion for the gauge connections A ab

Note that in action (1) the dreibein (or equivalently the
metric gµν) is the only independent ﬁeld, since ea and
˜ωab are related through the second Cartan’s structure
equation that states the vanishing of the torsion made
out of ˜ω,

˜T a = ˜Dea = dea + ˜ωa

ﬁxing completely the components of ˜ω in terms of the
dreibein and its ﬁrst derivatives [12]. The particular
choice of parameters,

deﬁnes the so called chiral point of TMG (CG) which
makes one of the CS copies in (1) to vanish, making the
model to be a single CS Lagranian for a gauge connec-
tion A ab
cec that describes the dynamics of
a three dimensional Riemannian manifold.
A RC geometry allows the presence of torsion in the man-
ifold, and hence it does not relate the spin connection and
the dreibein through a relation such as (2). Here we want
to generalize the action of CG to a RC geometry. To de-
scribe a manifold with torsion it is necessary to allow its
aﬃne structure to enter as a dynamical ﬁeld in the same
footing as the dreibein does for its metric description. We
call this spin connection ωab and incorporates torsional

T a = Dea = κa
b

∧ eb,

which is non zero in general. There is an irreducible
decomposition to write the contorsion in terms of its trace
and axial parts as

κab = −φǫab

cec − A[aeb] + M ab,

n! (Xa1a2...an

where φ is a scalar ﬁeld for the antisymmetric, or axial
part, Aa the vector part, related to the trace of the tor-
cec is the mixed part of vanishing
sion, and M ab = M ab
trace and antisymmetric part (M[abc] = 0, M ab
b = 0).
Here X[a1a2...an] = 1
± permutations) denotes
normalized antisymmetrization. It is clear that the spin
connection ωab becomes A ab
− when it has an axial contor-
sion 1-form of constant value parametrized by l−1. Hence
CG can be interpreted as a CS theory for a connection
with constant antisymmetric torsion.
Consider now the three-dimensional CS Lagrangian for a

eﬀective theory that couples the scalar ﬁeld non mini-
mally to geometry,

It is important to keep in mind that an overall tilde (˜ )
denotes quantities built with the Riemannian connection

constraint is implemented by adding to (6) a Lagrange

Here we address the next extension of the model by in-
cluding the vector part of the contorsion,

This incorporates four out of the nine independent com-
ponents of κab. In (5) it yields an action for ea, φ and

III. LOCAL WEYL SYMMETRY

A. Weyl Symmetry of a CS Lagrangian

3

B. The Weyl-Gauged CG Theory

From a gauge theory point of view, transformation (12)
suggests A as a gauge connection for a Weyl symmetry.
In fact we will demonstrate here that Lagrangian (9) is
the gauge invariant version of (6) under Weyl rescalings,
to which A is its compensating ﬁeld. A general procedure
for Weyl-gauging TMG was made in [14].
Take action (6) as a particular version of TMG non min-
imally coupled to a scalar ﬁeld at the chiral point, in-
variant under global Weyl transformations φ → e−Ωφ,
ea → eΩea, where Ω is a constant. Perform now the
usual procedure of localization of a symmetry, when the
transformation parameter is promoted to a local func-
tion Ω → Ω(x), and a gauge ﬁeld A is introduced. This
ﬁeld deﬁnes a covariant exterior derivative for the Weyl
group, symbolically D = d − 1
2 A, in such a way that
it makes the derivatives to transform covariantly under
Weyl rescalings,

D ′φ′ = e−ΩDφ

D ′ea′ = eΩDea

Dφ = dφ −

Aφ,

A ∧ ea,

enforcing A to transform as in (12). Next we will write
action (6) in terms of covariant derivatives instead of par-
tial ones,

Lagrangian (4) is purely topological and it does not
depend explicitly on the dreibein. Due to this fact it
posses a hidden symmetry through its transformation.
A Weyl rescaling such as

L (e, ∂e; φ, ∂φ) −→ L (e, De; φ, Dφ; A).

To do this let us write the Weyl-covariant version of the
second Cartan’s structure equation (2),

ea → eΩea,
ωab → ωab,

(10)
(11)

where Ω = Ω(x) is a point dependent function, leaves the
action (4) invariant. A contorsion with antisymmetric
part only, does not posses the amount of ﬁelds required
to compensate the transformation induced in ˜ω due to
(10), in order to preserve the sum ω = ˜ω + κ invariant.
That is the reason why this symmetry was not present
in [8]. Here, on the contrary, the symmetry remains af-
ter the decomposition (8) that led us to (9). Indeed, a
transformation such as (10) will change ˜ω by imposing
that (2) to hold in the new frame, according to

˜ωab → ˜ωab − 2∂[aΩeb],

thus κ must change as

κab → κab + 2∂[aΩeb],

in order for (11) to hold, regarding (3). We ﬁnd that the
eﬀective transformation at the level of scalar and vector
ﬁeld that deﬁnes this contorsion are

A → A − 2dΩ ,

φ → e−Ωφ.

(12)

Lagrangian (9) is invariant under (10) and (12).

∧ eb = 0,

where ˜wab is invariant. From this connection we con-
struct a Weyl-invariant curvature,
˜Rab = d ˜wab + ˜wa
c

∧ ˜wcb.

Thus, the local Weyl-invariant version of action (6) is
made out of these new curvature and connection,

where A2 = AaAa. Finally, replacing (14,15) in (13)
yields to (9) that concludes the demonstration.
Thus the inclusion of the trace of torsion in (4) is equiva-
lent to the localization procedure used in gauge theories
to give rise to interactions. This makes our interpretation
of φ and A as matter ﬁelds more conﬁdent.

IV. DYNAMICS

Extremizing the action with respect to φ, A and e gives
the equations of motion that determine our dynamics. In
order to achieve that, we have to incorporate the con-
straint (7) to (9) and then vary also with respect to ˜ω
and ζ. The action is given by

The Lagrange multiplier will naturally appear in the
equations of motion, so the procedure ends when ζa has
been taken out of the system. Due to the Weyl symme-
try, the scalar ﬁeld can be gauged to a constant l−1. In
that case (9) is a Chern-Simons-Proca (CSP) theory for
A, minimally coupled to CG.

Here ιa is the contraction operator, deﬁned to act on a p-

(p−1)! paa1···ap−1ea1 ∧· · · ∧eap−1 . Something
rather remarkable is found in this model, namely Eq.

Moreover, we recognize the r.h.s of (17) to be propor-
tional to the energy momentum 2-form of TME τa[A],

This means that any solution of CG coupled to TME
can be gauged, by a U (1) transformation, to a solution
of the system (16,17) whenever the photon mass has the
particular value (18), see for instance [15]. The 1-form
A, in this model, gravitates as a Maxwell ﬁeld,

τc[A],

resembling the physics of a well known theory of elec-
trodynamics, namely TME, without further requirement
more than the scalar ﬁeld to acquire a constant value.
This enforces the interpretation of A as an electromag-
netic ﬁeld. However we must recall that A is not a gauge
ﬁeld for U (1) but for Weyl. This can be seen in the
fact that φ is a real scalar ﬁeld that carries a current
J = δLφ/δA, where Lφ are the terms of the Lagrangian
which depend on φ,

J = ∗Dφ,

which is not an electric current, but a Weyl one. We call
the attention to this point on the fact that the equiv-
alence between (9) and TME is manifest in particular
gauge ﬁxings of both theories.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We set here that there is a Chern-Simons interpreta-
tion for Chiral Gravity coupled to a Chern-Simons-Proca
electrodynamics. We found that the model, at the level of
equations of motion, is a gauged version of Chiral Gravity
coupled to Topologically Massive Electrodynamics with a
particular value of the coupling constant; namely, when
the photon mass equals twice the AdS radius. The 1-
form A coming from the trace of the torsion tensor was
fairly interpreted as a gauged ﬁeld for the Weyl group.
Here torsion responds as a matter ﬁeld, which resembles
an electromagnetic interaction.
