Abstract. We investigate cofree coalgebras, and limits and colimits of coalgebras in some abelian
monoidal categories of interest, such as bimodules over a ring, and modules and comodules over
a bialgebra or Hopf algebra. We ﬁnd concrete generators for the categories of coalgebras in these
monoidal categories, and explicitly construct cofree coalgebras, products and limits of coalgebras in
each case. This answers an open question in [1] on the existence of a cofree coring, and constructs
the cofree (co)module coalgebra on a B-(co)module, for a bialgebra B.

1. Introduction

The free algebra on a set or vector space, i.e. non-commutative polynomial algebras, as well as
the free group or monoid, represent fundamental constructions in algebra, and their importance is
already well established. Moreover, the construction of the free algebra - the tensor algebra - is
suitable for use in monoidal categories. We refer to [2], [10] for basics on monoidal categories. A
monoid in the monoidal category (C, ⊗, I) (or algebra when C is abelian) is a triple (A, m, u), where
m : A ⊗ A → A and u : I → A are the multiplication and unit respectively, satisfying appropriate
associativity and unital conditions which are the categorical analogue of the usual monoid/algebra
axioms; morphisms of monoids are deﬁned by analogy too. Let M on(C) denote the category of
monoids in C, and U : M on(C) → C be the forgetful functor. By a basic observation (see [10,
Chapter 7]), if (C, ⊗, I) has denumerable coproducts and ⊗ commutes with these coproducts, then
the tensor algebra T (V ) = L
n≥0
A comonoid in C is simply a monoid in the opposite category C0. Denote CoM on(C) = M on(C0).
Both monoids and comonoids are important objects; hence, ﬁnding a universal “comonoid” is a
basic question of interest. Speciﬁcally, the problem formulates as follows: given a monoidal category
C, does the forgetful functor M on(C0) → C0 have a left adjoint, or equivalently, does the forgetful
CoM on(C) → C have a right adjoint, the “cofree” comonoid? This is often of interest for the same
types of categories in which one considers monoids and to which Mac Lane’s construction of the
free monoid applies. However, to use it to obtain cofree comonoids in C, equivalently, for monoids
in C0, one needs that ⊗ commutes with denumerable products in C, and this is almost never the
case for any monoidal category of interest; this fails, for example, even in the case of vector spaces.

V ⊗n gives a left adjoint to U (the free algebra).

Hence, one needs diﬀerent considerations to construct cofree comonoids, and, of course, the nat-
ural method is to use Freyd’s adjoint functor theorem. We will consider this question for several
categories that present interest, namely, the category AMA of bimodules over a ring A, and the
categories of modules BM or comodules MB over a bialgebra (or Hopf algebra) B. We will de-
note Alg(C) = M on(C) and CoAlg(C) = CoM on(C) when C is abelian, i.e algebras=monoids and
coalgebras=comonoids as it is the usual terminology in this case. We recall that a coalgebra in
the category of bimodules over a ring A is called an A-coring. Corings have been extensively stud-
ied over the past 15 years, especially due to the fact that they are very common in algebra and

representation theory. Many important categories can be realized as comodules over suitable cor-
ings: modules, categories of actions and co-actions of bialgebras, modules over algebras in certain
monoidal categories, chain complexes, (diﬀerentially) graded modules, quasi-coherent sheaves, gen-
eralized quiver representations, etc.; we refer the reader to [5] and references therein. The existence
of cofree coalgebras over ﬁelds has been known for a long time [4], [7]; it was obtained for coalgebras
over arbitrary commutative rings in [3], and some constructions for the non-coassociative case are
given in [8]. The cofree coring over An is constructed in [9], and the problem is answered for von
Neumann regular rings in [13] (see also [12]). The main diﬃculty in generalizing to arbitrary bi-
modules ([8], [13]) is to deal with the pathological behavior of the tensor product over an arbitrary
ring A. The question of whether a cofree coring always exists is proposed as an open problem in
[1]. A closely related question turns out to be whether the category of comonoids in a monoidal
category is complete, and in particular, if limits of A-corings exist (see [1]).

A natural setting for the study of such questions is, of course, the general categorical framework of
the Special Adjoint Functor Theorem [SAFT]; (see also [13]). We investigate cofree coalgebras and
completeness for the category of coalgebras CoAlg(C) for the case when C = AMA, or C = BM
or C = MB, which are of particular interest among monoidal categories. In general, it is easy to
note that, when C is co-wellpowered and cocomplete, then CoAlg(C) is cocomplete, co-wellpowered
and the forgetful preserves colimits. Although existence of the adjoints can be obtained in greater
generality, our emphasis is on ﬁnding concrete constructions of these universal objects, which can
be written out in terms of generators of the respective category of coalgebras. Hence, our main
goal is to give explicit sets of generators for each of the above categories, and obtain these adjoints
explicitly. These results can also be regarded as counterparts of the fundamental (local) ﬁniteness
theorem of coalgebras over ﬁelds. First, in Section 2 we recall the construction of the adjoint in
SAFT, and give a simple construction using the same idea as the proof of SAFT, that explicitly
describes the products and limits in the category of comonoids CoM on(C) in a suitable monoidal
category C. In Section 3 we note that A-corings are generated by corings of inﬁnite cardinality less
or equal to that of A and ℵ0; over von-Neumann regular rings, or countably generated algebras,
countably generated or countable dimensional corings generate the category. In Section 4 we show
that if B is a bialgebra, B-module coalgebras which are ﬁnitely generated over B form a set of
generators for the category of all B-module coalgebras; we also show that ﬁnite dimensional B-
comodule coalgebras generate the category CoAlg(MB). When B is a Hopf algebra, comatrix
coalgebras in MB can be deﬁned and they generate CoAlg(MB). We then apply the formulas
obtained in Section 2 to concretely describe cofree coalgebras and limits in each case. Our emphasis
is on the constructive direct approach, which yields working formulas for these universal objects;
these can useful to the general reader working with concrete monoidal categories.

2. Preliminaries

In this section, we recall the construction used in the Special Adjoint Functor Theorem (or SAFT)
due to P. Freyd, and use it to provide formulas that will be applied in several situations. A functor
U that has a right adjoint commutes with limits, and the SAFT says that under additional natural
hypothesis, this is enough to ﬁnd such an adjoint. Recall that a category C is called co-wellpowered
if for every object C in C, the equivalence classes of epimorphisms with source C form set. The
(dual) SAFT asserts that if C is a cocomplete (has small colimits), co-wellpowered category and
with a generating set, then every co-continuous functor U (i.e. U commutes with colimits) from C
to a locally small category M has a right adjoint.
We also brieﬂy recall the construction of the adjoint, since it will be of importance in our examples.
It can be formulated in the following way. Let G be a set of generators of C, and for each M in
M, let E be the category whose objects are pairs (C, f ) with C in C, and f : U (C) → M is a

morphism in M. Morphisms in this category are (ϕ, ∗) : (C, f ) → (C ′, f ′) such that ϕ : C → C ′
is a morphism in C, and ∗ means simply that the condition f ′U (φ) = f is satisﬁed. Consider also
E the full subcategory of E of objects of the type (G, f ) for G ∈ G. Let F : E → C be deﬁned by
F (G, f ) = G and F (ϕ, ∗) = ϕ on morphisms. Then F is a functor, and since the class of objects
of E is a set (since C is co-wellpowered), it has a colimit. Let (R(M ), fM ) = lim
F .

F (G) = lim

(G,f )∈E

Then (R(M ), fM ) is a ﬁnal object in E, which in turn helps proving that it is a ﬁnal object in
E. We need to recall this argument, as it will be used later. Given C in C together with a
morphism f : U (C) → M in M, use the generators G to write C =
G and (C, f ) =

p:G→C
two inductive systems induced by the correspondence (G, p) 7−→ (G, f U (p)),we get a canonical
morphism ψC : C → R(M ) in C which turns out unique with fM ψC = f .
We will need the following short hand formulas to explicitly compute several functors.

We will also need the following observation, which is similar to the above discussion. Let M, C be
categories, U : C → M be a faithful functor. For convenience, we will interpret U as a “forgetful”
functor and slightly abuse notation sometimes to write U (C) = C; similarly, if f : U (C) → U (C ′)
is a morphism in M, we say f is a morphism in C if f = U (g) for some (unique) g ∈ HomC(C, C ′).
Fix an object N in M and objects (Ci)i∈I in C and a family of morphisms fi : N → U (Ci) in M;
the set I can be empty. Assume C and M each have an initial object denoted 0 and U (0) = 0.
Let H be the comma category whose objects are (E, p), E ∈ C, p ∈ HomM(U (E), N ) and such that
fip is a morphism in C for all i; the morphisms (E, p) → (E′, p′) of this category are given by
h ∈ HomC(E, E′) with p′h = p (i.e. p′U (h) = p). We show that this category H has a ﬁnal object
under the same conditions as in SAFT; when I = ∅, this is exactly the construction in SAFT.

Proposition 2.1. If C is cocomplete, co-wellpowered and has a set G of generators, and M, C
have the same initial object 0. Then the category H has a ﬁnal object, which we denote by
(H0(N, (fi)i), p0).

Proof. Let H0 be the full subcategory of H whose objects (G, p) are such that G ∈ G. Note
that H0 has at least one object 0 ∈ C, since 0 is also the initial object in M, so the compositions
0 → N

fi→ Ci are morphisms in C. Let

morphisms (in C) of the colimit, so p0σ(G,p) = p (more precisely, p0U (σ(G,p)) = p).

We show that p0 is a morphism in H. Fix i, and consider the morphisms fip : G → Ci which
are morphisms in C (since (G, p) is in H; that is, fip = U (hi)); there is a unique morphism in
θ : E0 → Ci in C such that θσ(G,p) = fip for all (G, p). But fip0 (a morphism in M) already
satisﬁes this equation, and since the colimit in 2.3 is also a colimit in M by hypothesis, we obtain
that θ = fip0 (obviously, here we implicitly use that U is faithful). Hence, fip0 is a morphism in
C. This shows that p0 is in M or(H). The fact that (E0, p0) is the ﬁnal object in the category H
follows as in the proof of SAFT, along the lines noted in the comments preceding this proposition.
(cid:3)

Remark 2.2. We will use the above notation (H0(N ; (fi)i), p0) and proposition to construct limits.
Let M, C be a cocomplete categories, U : C → M a faithful functor preserving colimits. Assume
M is also complete, C is co-wellpowered, has a set of generators G and C and M have initial objects
0 with U (0) = 0. Then C is complete (i.e. has all small limits), which can be computed as follows.
Let F : A → C be a functor from a small category to C, and let P = lim
U F be the limit (in M)
←−
of U F , with canonical morphisms qa : P → U F (a) in M, a ∈ A, i.e. we may write qa : P → F (a)
are morphisms in M. Let (E0, p0) = (H0(P, (qa)a), p0), p0 : E0 → P in M (more precisely
p0 : U (E0) → P ). We note that (E0, (πa)a) with πa = qap0 is the limit of F . Of course, πa are
also morphisms in C by construction. To see E0 is this limit, consider ha : C → F (a) a family of
morphisms in C which is a cone on F (so if x : a → b then hbF (x) = ha).

Then U (ha) ∈ M or(M) and U (ha) is a cone on U F , and by applying the limit property we get a
unique morphism h in M with qah = ha. Since qah = ha are in fact morphism in C (images of U ),
there is a unique s in C with p0s = h, so πas = qah = ha. The uniqueness of s with this property
follows again easily by backward chase using the universal properties of E0 and P .
We note that a similar process is used in [1] for describing products of coalgebras over a ﬁeld, but
with an extra-intermediate step: the canonical map p0 : E0 → P is obtained using the right adjoint
R of U and the canonical map cP : R(P ) → P ; of course, our p0 factors through R(P ), but this
intermediate step is not necessary in general. We can also recall the following easy observation.

Proposition 2.3. Let C be a monoidal category, CoM on(C) be the category of comonoids of C and
U : CoM on(C) → C be the forgetful functor.
(i) If C is cocomplete, then CoM on(C) is cocomplete and U preserves colimits.
(ii) If furthermore C is co-wellpowered, then so is CoM on(C).

Proof. (i) is well known and follows similar to the case of bimodules C = AMA [5].
(ii) It is enough to show that if µ : C → D and ν : C → E are in Epi(CoM on(C)) and equivalent as
epimorphisms in C, then they are equivalent in Epi(CoM on(C)) (as epimorphisms). Let h : D → E
be an isomorphism in M for which hµ = ν and we show that h is in fact an isomorphism in C.

in C, ∆E h = (h ⊗ h)∆D . Similarly, we have ǫE hµ = ǫE ν = ǫC = ǫD µ, and it follows that ǫE h = ǫD .
Hence, h is a morphism in CoM on(C), and so is its C inverse.
(cid:3)

3. Cofree corings and limits

Let A be a ring and AMA the category of A-bimodules. Recall that an A-coring is a comonoid
(or coalgebra) in the monoidal category AMA (see [5]). Let CrgA be the category of A-corings,
and U : CrgA → AMA the forgetful functor. A subcoring D of a coring C is deﬁned to be an
A-sub-bimodule D of C such that the inclusion map D ֒→ C is a morphism of corings. Using the
observations in the previous section and Proposition 2.3, we have

Proposition 3.1. CrgA is cocomplete, co-wellpowered and U : CrgA → AMA preserves colimits.

To explicitly ﬁnd products of and co-free corings, we focus on constructing generators. We start
with a simple motivational observation, which explains the main idea and recovers the result of
[13]. A submodule N of a left A-module M is called a pure submodule provided that for any
right A-module P , the induced map P ⊗A N → P ⊗A M is mono. Assume A is von Neumann
regular, so all A-modules are ﬂat, and all monomorphisms are pure. If C is an A-coring, and S
is an A-submodule of C, let S′ ⊇ S be the sub-bimodule generated by all m, m1, m2 for m ∈ S
m1 ⊗ m2. Note that since S′ ⊆ C is pure as left and right A-module, we can
and ∆(m) = P
regard S′ ⊗ S′ as a sub-bimodule of C, and so ∆(S) ⊆ S′ ⊗ S′. Moreover, if S is ﬁnitely generated
as an A-bimodule, then S′ can be chosen ﬁnitely generated too, since ∆ is A-bilinear:
let S′ be
generated by the m1, m2’s for m in a system of generators of S. We then iterate this construction
to get S(n+1) = (S(n))′, and S = S
S(n). Regard S ⊗ S ⊆ C ⊗ C, and ∆(S) ⊆ S ⊗ S, since
∆(S(n)) ⊆ S(n+1) ⊗ S(n+1). Using this, Remark 2.2 and Proposition 3.1, we get the following
version of fundamental theorem for corings.

m

n

Proposition 3.2. Let A be a von Neumann regular ring, and C ∈ CrgA. Then every ﬁnite subset
of C is contained in a subcoring D of C which is a pure left and right A-submodule and countably
generated as an A-bimodule. Hence, U has a right adjoint, and the category CrgA is complete.

By Remark 2.2, the cofree coring on an A-bimodule V is C(V ) =

C.

[f :C→V ]∈AMA|ACA is ℵ0− generated

Therefore, to ﬁnd generators of CrgA, we look for a type of fundamental theorem of corings, in
which we deal with non-ﬂatness in general. Naturally, the idea is to close up a sub-bimodule S of
C ∈ CrgA not only under ∆ but also under “purity”. This is the essential idea of [3], which we brieﬂy
recall and note that it adapts straightforward to the most general case. The following theorem is
well-known as Cohn’s criterion for pure left A-modules, which we recall here for convenience [6].
Theorem 3.3. (P.M. Cohn) Let M be a left A-module, and ¯M ⊆ M be a submodule. Then ¯M is
a pure submodule of M if and only if every ﬁnite system of linear equations

with ¯mj ∈ ¯M , λij ∈ A has a solution in ¯M whenever it has one in M .

Remark 3.4. The following is a well known procedure. Let N be an A-sub-bimodule of M . Consider
all ﬁnite systems (3.1) for the left A-module N , and also for the right A-module N , and let N ′ be
the sub-bimodule of M generated by all these solutions. Iterate this to get a chain N ⊆ N ′ ⊆ N ′′ ⊆
N (n). By Cohn’s test N ∗ is a pure left and right sub-bimodule
. . . N (n) ⊆ . . . , with union N ∗ = S
of M containing N ; moreover |N ∗| ≤ max{|A|, |N |, ℵ0} (| − | denotes cardinality).

Given A-bimodules M, N with sub-bimodules M ′, N ′ denote M ′ · N ′ the image of the canonical
map M ′ ⊗ N ′ → M ⊗ N .
If (C, ∆, ε) is a coring, we call a sub-bimodule M of C invariant if
∆(M ) ⊆ M · M . As before, we note that every sub-bimodule M of C is contained in an invariant
m1 ⊗ m2 for each m ∈ M , and let M ′ be the sub-bimodule generated by
one: write ∆(m) = P
all m1’s and m2’s; it contains M by the counit property: m = P
ε(m1)m2. Iterate this to get
a sequence M ⊆ M ′ ⊆ M ′′ ⊆ . . . ; if M ∼ is the union, it is clear that M ∼ is invariant, and its
cardinality again does not exceed max{|A|, |M |, ℵ0}.
Finally, let S be a sub-bimodule of C, and iterate alternatively so that S0 = S, S2n+1 = S∼

A-submodule of C. Also, by purity, the canonical map D ⊗ D → D · D ⊂ C ⊗ C is injective, which
means ∆ : C → C ⊗ C factors to ∆|D : D → D ⊗ D, and D becomes a subcoring of C. Hence, we
can conclude the main result of this section:

Theorem 3.5. (i) Let C be an A-coring. Then every A-sub-bimodule S of C is contained in a sub-
coring D of C which is pure as left and as right A-submodule, and such that |D| ≤ max{|S|, |A|, ℵ0}.
(ii) CrgA is generated by all corings of cardinality ≤ max{|A|, ℵ0}.
(iii) There is a cofree coring C(V ) on every A-bimodule V ; moreover, using equations 2.1 and 2.2

with canonical maps (qaf p0)a, where (C(P )0, p0) = (H0(P, (qaf )a), p0) is the construction of 2.2.

We note that (iv) is also the main result of [12], and (iii) was raised in [1]; our emphasis is to
answer these questions in a constructive way, and to explicitly produce the cofree coring and limit
of corings. We also note that the system of generators for CrgA can be chosen better in some
situations, as it was the case for von Neumann regular rings.

Proposition 3.6. Let A be a countably generated K-algebra over a ﬁeld K. If C is an A-coring,
then for every at most countable dimensional A-sub-bimodule M of C, there is a subcoring D of C
such that D is a pure left and right A-submodule of C, M ⊆ D and dim(D) ≤ ℵ0. In particular,
the A-corings of at most countable dimension generate CrgA.

Proof. Under the current hypotheses and previous notations, note that if N ⊂ C with dim(N ) ≤
ℵ0, we may choose the submodule N ∗ such that dim(N ∗) ≤ ℵ0. Indeed, one needs to recursively
add all solutions to the system of equations 3.1; but at each step, it is enough to consider all
such systems with mij-coeﬃcients in a ﬁxed basis of N (k), and with coeﬃcients λij ∈ A coming
from from a ﬁxed basis of A. Iterating this countably many times, each N (k) has dim(N (k)) ≤
ℵ0 and so dim(N ∗) ≤ ℵ0. Similarly, given M with dim(M ) ≤ ℵ0, for a basis (mi)i≥1 choose
mij ⊗ nij and let ¯M be the A-sub-bimodule generated
representations as ﬁnite tensors ∆(mi) = P
by all the mi, mij, nij; it will be at most countable dimensional since dim(A) ≤ ℵ0. Hence, the M ∼
constructed before can be chosen with dim(M ∼) ≤ ℵ0, and countable iteration combining the two
processes yields a countable dimensional pure subcoring.

{D→V }

Corollary 3.7. If A is a K algebra with dim(A) = γ and C is an A-coring, then every subset F
of C with |F | ≤ γ is contained in a subcoring D of C which is a pure left and right A-submodule
of C and such that dim(D) ≤ max{γ, ℵ0}.

In the case of CoAlgK = coalgebras over a ﬁeld K, we note that the generators are much more
precise. Of course, the ﬁnite dimensional coalgebras generate CoAlgK. This explains one of the
classical constructions of the cofree coalgebra C(V ) over a vector space V (see [7, Chapter 1]) in
a new perspective. For example, if V is ﬁnite dimensional, C(V ) = T (V ∗)0, where A0 denotes the
ﬁnite dual coalgebra of the algebra A; one has A0 =
(A/I)∗. But for a ﬁnite dimensional
algebra B, HomAlg(T (V ∗), B) = HomK(V ∗, B) = HomK(B∗, V ). So, the colimit building T (V ∗)0
is thus the colimit of D over linear maps D → V for ﬁnite dimensional coalgebras D. Recall that
if n ≥ 1, the coalgebra M c

n(K) = (Mn(K))∗ is called the comatrix coalgebra over K.

4. Cofree coalgebras in monoidal categories of modules and comodules over

bialgebras and Hopf algebras

As an application of the above ideas, we also look at the case of coalgebras in the category MH
of right H-comodules and HM of left H-modules, where H is a bialgebra (or a Hopf algebra). We
refer the reader to [7] and [14] for basic Hopf algebra deﬁnitions and notations. Let CoAlg(MH )
and CoAlg(HM) be the category of coalgebras in MH and HM, respectively. Recall that MH
and HM are monoidal categories; moreover, the objects of the category CoAlg(MH ) are precisely
the H-comodule coalgebras, and the objects of CoAlg(HM) are the H-module coalgebras (see [7,
Chapter 6]). Using again Remark 2.2 and Proposition 2.3 and the remarks in section 2 we obtain:
Proposition 4.1. The categories of coalgebras CoAlg(MH ) and CoAlg(HM) are cocomplete, co-
wellpowered, and the forgetful functors F H : CoAlg(MH ) −→ MH and FH : CoAlg(HM) −→ HM
preserve colimits.

We explicitly write generators for these two categories. We will have somewhat diﬀerent situations.

Module coalgebras.

Proposition 4.2. Let C be a left H-module coalgebra, and F a ﬁnite subset of C. Then F is
contained in a submodule subcoalgebra D of C (i.e. D is a H-submodule and subcoalgebra of C)
which is ﬁnitely generated as a left H-module .

Proof. Let E ⊆ C be the subcoalgebra generated by F ; it is ﬁnite dimensional by the fundamental
theorem of coalgebras. Let D = HE be the left H-submodule of C generated by E. Write
∆H(h) = P h1 ⊗ h2 and ∆C(c) = P c(1) ⊗ c(2). If c ∈ E, h ∈ H, then P(h · c)(1) ⊗ (h · c)(2) =
h1c(1) ⊗ h2c(2) ∈ H · E ⊗ H · E, so H · E is a H-submodule subcoalgebra of C.

Corollary 4.3. The left H-module coalgebras f.g.CoAlg(HM) which are ﬁnitely generated as
left H-modules form a system of generators for CoAlg(HM). Consequently, the functor FH :
CoAlg(HM) → HM has a right adjoint GH given by

Comodule coalgebras. We can prove a stronger statement for this case. Recall that for an
algebra A, the ﬁnite dual (or representative) coalgebra of A is A0 = {f ∈ A∗|∃ n, gi, hi ∈ A∗, i =

n

1, . . . , n such that f (ab) =

gi(a)hi(b), ∀ a, b ∈ A}. We refer to [7] for equivalent characterizations.

We note that while in general A0 6= A∗ unless dim(A) < ∞, in fact every f ∈ A∗ is “locally
representative” in the sense of the following Lemma, which is standard linear algebra.

The following ﬁniteness theorem may be known, but we were unable to locate a reference.
proof is straightforward, and we sketch it for completeness. We recall that if C is a coalgebra and
(M, ρ : M → M ⊗ C) is a ﬁnite dimensional right C-comodule, then there is a ﬁnite dimensional
subcoalgebra D of C such that ρ(M ) ⊆ M ⊗ D. The smallest such coalgebra cfC(M ) is unique
and is called the coalgebra of coeﬃcients of M (see [7, Chapter 1]).

Theorem 4.5 (Finiteness theorem for comodule coalgebras). Let H be a bialgebra and C be a
right H-comodule coalgebra. Then every ﬁnite subset F of C is contained in a ﬁnite dimensional
subcomodule subcoalgebra D of C.

Proof. This can be proved by applying the ﬁniteness theorem of comodules over coalgebras, using
the crossed coproduct coalgebra H ⊲< C (see [11]) and regarding an H-subcomodule subcoalgebra
D of C as a subcomodule of C over the coalgebra (H ⊲< C) ⊗ C cop. However, a direct proof can
be done as well. Let E be a ﬁnite dimensional subcoalgebra of C with F ⊆ E. Then D = H ∗ · E is
the right H-subcomodule of C generated by E and dim(D) < ∞. It is enough to show that D is a
subcoalgebra of C. Let V = cfH(D) ⊆ H (H-coeﬃcients of D), so dim(V ) < ∞ as dim(D) < ∞.
For α ∈ H ∗, let βi, γi, i = 1, . . . , n ∈ H ∗ be such that α(ab) = βi(a)γi(b) for a, b ∈ V . Denote
ρC(c) = c0 ⊗ c1 the H-comodule structure of C and ∆H(h) = h1 ⊗ h2, ∆C(c) = c(1) ⊗ c(2) as before
with omitted summation symbol. Then for d ∈ E

If H is a Hopf algebra with antipode S, the category CoAlg(MH ) has special systems of matrix-like
generators. Recall that if M is a ﬁnite dimensional H-comodule, then the dual space M ∗ has a
structure of a right H-comodule, and MH has right dual objects (we refer to [2, Chapter 2] for
right and left duals in monoidal categories). If (vi)i; (v∗
i )i are ﬁnite dual bases of M , then the maps
i , and evM : M ∗ ⊗ M → K, evM (v∗ ⊗ v) = v∗(v) are
coM : K → M ⊗ M ∗, coM (1) = P
called co-evaluation and evaluation respectively. Recall also that the right H-comodule V ⊗ V ∗
becomes an algebra in MH with multiplication given by the canonical map 1V ⊗ evV ⊗ 1V ∗ :
V ⊗ (V ∗ ⊗ V ) ⊗ V ∗ ∼= (V ⊗ V ∗) ⊗ (V ⊗ V ∗) −→ V ⊗ K ⊗ V ∗ ∼= (V ⊗ V ∗) and unit coV : K → V ⊗ V ∗.
Similarly, the right H-comodule V ∗ ⊗ V becomes a coalgebra in MH via the analogous dual maps.
We recall a few well known facts to prove the following theorem on generators in CoAlg(MH ). If
U, V, W ∈ MH, then HomH(U ⊗ V, W ) = HomH(U, W ⊗ V ∗), i.e. V ⊗ W ∗ is the internal Hom
In particular, if (A, m, u) is an algebra in MH, HomH(A ⊗ A, A) =

HomH(A, A ⊗ A∗).

m : A⊗A → A to ϕ(m) = (a 7−→ P
to Mn(K); hence, if we forget the H-comodule structures, if m : A ⊗ A → A is the multiplication
of A, then ϕ(m) : A → A ⊗ A∗ is a morphism of algebras corresponding to the left regular
representation of A. By the canonical isomorphism HomH(U ⊗ V, W ) = HomH(U, W ⊗ V ∗), ϕ(m)
is a morphism in MH if m is so, and therefore, for a H-comodule algebra A, ϕ(m) : A → A ⊗ A∗
is a morphism of H-comodule algebras. Also, ϕ(m) is obviously injective, so it is a monomorphism
in Alg(MH ). Hence, we have

Theorem 4.7. The ﬁnite dimensional algebras of the form V ⊗ V ∗ for ﬁnite dimensional H-
comodules V , form a system of cogenerators in the category f dAlg(MH ) of ﬁnite dimensional
algebras in MH (and also in Alg(MH )). The coalgebras V ∗ ⊗ V form a system of generators of
CoAlg(MH ) (= the category of H-comodule coalgebras).

We end by noting that besides using the above generators, a construction for cofree coalgebras in
MH similar to that over vector spaces can be done. Namely, for an algebra A in MH one can
deﬁne a right ﬁnite dual A0 of A in a natural way. If the antipode of H is bijective, one can also
deﬁne a left ﬁnite dual 0A using left duals. If V is a ﬁnite dimensional right H-comodule, then the
tensor algebra T (∗V ) in the category MH has a right ﬁnite dual T (∗V )0 which is a coalgebra in
MH, and it is the cofree coalgebra on V . This can be extended to arbitrary V ’s as in the case of
coalgebras over ﬁelds. We leave the details of this construction to the reader. In particular, these
considerations apply to the category Y D(H) of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over H as well.
