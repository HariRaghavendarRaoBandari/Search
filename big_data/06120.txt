We provide uniﬁed phenomenological description of magnetooptic eﬀects being linear and
quadratic in magnetization. The description is based on few principal spectra, describing elements
of permittivity tensor up to the second order in magnetization. Each permittivity tensor element for
any magnetization direction and any sample surface orientation is simply determined by weighted
summation of the principal spectra, where weights are given by crystallographic and magnetization
orientations. The number of principal spectra depends on the symmetry of the crystal. In cubic
crystals owning point symmetry we need only four principal spectra. Here, the principal spectra
are expressed by ab-initio calculations for bcc Fe, fcc Co and fcc Ni in optical range as well as in
hard and soft x-ray energy range, i.e. at the 2p- and 3p-edges. We also express principal spectra
analytically using modiﬁed Kubo formula.

There is a vast number of physical phenomena proportional to quadratic form of magnetization.

In case of dc
transport phenomena, the most well-known examples are anisotropy magnetoresistance (AMR) [1, 2] or longitudinal
Hall eﬀect [3]. Within the magnetooptic community, the ﬁeld of magnetooptic eﬀects quadratic in magnetization
is complicated by incredible number of nomenclature, being called Cotton-Mouton eﬀect, Voigt eﬀect, quadratic
magnetooptic Kerr eﬀect (QMOKE) [4], magnetic linear birefringence, X-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD)
[5, 6], magnetic double refraction, magnetooptic orientation eﬀect, magnetooptic anisotropy, Hubert-Sch¨afer eﬀect or
magnetorefractive eﬀect [7, 8]. The nomenclature is not strictly deﬁned, however it refers either to type of samples
(liquid, gas, solid state) or it refers to experimental conﬁgurations of the setup (namely detecting change of light
intensity or detecting change of polarization state upon variation of magnetization direction). Although those eﬀects
are usually not considered as single phenomena, they originate from equal parts of permittivity tensors (i.e. from
equal symmetry breaking). Notice, that recently new types of quadratic-in-magnetization eﬀects arose, for example
anisotropic magneto-thermopower [9, 10] in spin-caloritronics. Within some generalization, one can expect that any
magneto-transport linear in magnetization will have its quadratic-in-magnetization counterpart.

The ﬁrst observation of magnetooptic eﬀects quadratic in magnetization dates back more than century ago in works
of Kerr [11], Majorana [12] and Cotton and Moutton [13], where magnetic birefringence was observed in liquids and
colloids. Later, those quadratic magnetooptic response was observed in gases, solid state materials and obviously
also in ferromagnetic materials. See large reviews of Smolenskii et al [14] and Ferr´e, Gehring [15] from 80’s. The
anisotropy of magnetooptic eﬀects (i.e. dependence of QMOKE on crystal and ﬁeld orientations) was investigated
for various systems. However, the investigation were mostly done for a single photon energy, for example Fe [16] or
antiferromagnetic RbMnF3 [17]. Buchmaier et al have even determined values of principal spectra (namely values of
2G44 and ∆G), however also only for a single photon energy [18]. The spectral investigations were rare, for example
spectroscopy of QMOKE for diﬀerent orientations of Ni surfaces by Krinchik [19] and Parker [20].

The evolution of quadratic magnetooptic eﬀects in X-ray photon energy range was rather independent on those in
extended visible range. The x-ray magnetic linear dichroism were theoretically predicted by Thole and van der Laan
[21, 22]. Due to experimental restrictions, the quadratic-in-magnetization eﬀects in X-ray range were measured in
absorption, i.e. dichroic eﬀects [23, 24] and later in polarization, Voigt eﬀect [5]. The XMLD was analytically
predicted for [100] and [111] magnetization axis by Kunes et al [25]. They showed that for the correct shape of the
XMLD spectra at L2,3 edges the exchange splitting of the core levels is necessary [26]. Later, with direct comparison
with the experiment the angular dependence of the XMLD of bcc Fe shown that the role of the valence spin-orbit
interaction is much weaker [27]. The simple model of Kunes et al that accounts for the diﬀerence of the XMLD
spectra for the high symmetry crystal directions, et. al with magnetization along [001] and [111] axis showed that
the origin is expressed as diﬀerent weighted spin densities of eg and t2g orbitals [28]. Shortly after, Arenholz et. al
[29, 30] have shown that in case of cubic crystals having point symmetry, XMLD along any quantization axis can be
expressed as weighted sum of two fundamental spectra.

This approach was extended to tetragonal crystal ﬁeld by Laan et al, extending number of fundamental spectra to
four, demonstrated on CoFe2O4 [31]. Krug et al [32] have generalize this approach from XMLD fundamental spectra
to fundamental spectra of scattering form-factor F, where imaginary part of F corresponds to light absorption. Later,
Havekort et al have expressed symmetry arguments also for other crystal symmetries [33]. Recently, the quadratic
eﬀects in magnetization like Voigt in reﬂection or XMLD were detected and theoretically explained also in the soft

x-ray energy range, i. e. at the 3p edges of transition metals [6, 34, 35].

From phenomenological point of view, all magnetooptic eﬀects are described by conductivity σij, permittivity εij
or scattering Fij tensors, being simply convertible between each other. In following, we use tensor of permittivity,
being mostly employed in optical community. From quantum-mechanical point of view, the fundamental part of
the permittivity tensor is optical absorption, related to optical dispersion by Kramers-Kronig relations [36]. The
relations of magnetooptic response (or in general to any magneto-transport) to crystallographic orientation is given
by symmetry arguments, predicting dependence of the permittivity tensor elements on magnetization direction for
eﬀects being independent, linear, quadratic, cubic etc in magnetization. In case of magnetooptic eﬀects quadratic-
in-magnetization, the form of such tensors can be found in works of Birss [37], Nye [38] and Bhagavantam [39] and
Visnovsky [40], whose notation is used in this article. Symmetry arguments predict, that the permittivity tensor
is given by a weighted sum of constituent single dielectric tensor elements, where their weights are given solely by
direction of magnetization.

In this article, we express principal spectra, i.e. the non-magnetic, linear and quadratic contributions in magne-
tization for permittivity tensors, from which the complete spectra of permittivity tensor can be obtained for any
magnetization direction. Then, we express principal spectra calculated from ﬁrst principles of cubic material bcc Fe,
fcc Co and fcc Ni for three spectral ranges, extended visible range, soft and hard x-rays (at the 2p-edges and 3p-edges,
respectively). Finally, we express principal spectra directly using modiﬁed Kubo formula.

I. PERMITTIVITY TENSOR IN CUBIC CRYSTALS

The optical or conductivity properties of generally anisotropic material are described by (generally complex) per-
mittivity εij or conductivity σij tensor, being mutually related by (in SI units) εij = iσij/ω + δij, where δij being
Kronecker delta and ω light frequency (i.e. ω = 0 corresponds to d.c. current). Onsager relations require antisymmetry
in magnetization direction, εij(M ) = εji(−M ). As various magnetization direction causes small perturbation to the
crystal optical properties, εij, they can be expressed as Taylor series of permittivity tensor in direction of M [40]

In order to express G-elements for crystals with cubic symmetry, the elements can be rearranged deﬁning Gs =
G11−(G12 +G21)/2 and ∆Γ = (G12−G21)/2. Note that alternative way used to express anisotropy of the permittivity
is ∆G = G11 − 2G44 − (G12 + G21)/2 [16, 41]. In case of cubic crystals owning point Oh symmetry, G12 = G21 and
hence Gs = G11 − G12, ∆Γ = 0 [39]. In case of isotropic medium, then both ∆G = 0, ∆Γ = 0. Furthermore, notice,
that spectra of G11 element can not be determined (only value of Gs) as for the ferromagnetic materials, the magnitude
of magnetization vector |M| is constant for any magnetization direction and hence G11 becomes inseparable part of
ε(0) .

Hence, spectra of any permittivity element εij (up to second order in magnetization) can be expressed as weighted
sum of principal spectra, where the weights are determined by crystallographic and magnetization directions. Table I
demonstrates those weights for ˆx (cid:107) [100], ˆy (cid:107) [010] and ˆz (cid:107) [001] oriented crystal for two magnetization scans, used
later in ab-initio calculations. Namely, the angular dependence of εij permittivity elements is expressed for two

II. DETERMINATION OF PRINCIPAL SPECTRA

To determine all principal spectra we ﬁrst separate linear and quadratic contributions, by extracting oﬀ-diagonal
linear in magnetization ((εij −εji)/2, i (cid:54)= j), oﬀ-diagonal quadratic in magnetization ((εij +εji)/2, i (cid:54)= j) and diagonal
quadratic in magnetization ((εii − εjj)/2, i (cid:54)= j) contributions from which the principal spectra are determined. The
examples of angular dependencies of those contributions are demonstrated in Fig. 1 for Fe at photon energies 1.3 eV
and 56 eV. In Figs. 2–4 we show principal spectra of ε(0), K, Gs, 2G44 for bcc Fe, fcc Co and fcc Ni. As those materials
own point Oh symmetry ∆Γ = 0. The parts of the spectra related with light absorption are shown in ﬁrst four lines,
whereas last four lines are related to light dispersion (determined by Kramers-Kronig relations [36]).

Two approaches to determine principal spectra are used. (i) We determine principal spectra from ab-initio calculated
εij for in-plane and out-of-plane magnetization scans. For both scans, the angular dependences as predicted by
symmetry arguments for cubic crystals are presented in Tab. I. Knowing those dependences we can extract all principal
spectra. Two pairs of spectra of Gs and 2G44 are determined, each pair from one scan. For computational details, see
Appendix A. (ii) We determine principal spectra solely from εij calculated for magnetization pointing in fundamental
symmetry directions such as [100], [110] or [111] being suﬃcient to determine all principal spectra. Tab. II summarizes
analytical expressions of principal spectra from known permittivity elements with magnetization at fundamental
magnetization directions. Two pairs of spectra are determined, spectra of Gs from [100] and [110] magnetization
directions, and spectra of 2G44 from [110] and [111] magnetization directions.

Obviously, when calculated angular dependences follow relations predicted by symmetry arguments, and when we
neglect contributions of higher order eﬀects, both approaches providing four pairs of spectra should be identical. All
those principal spectra are shown in Figures 2-4 for Gs and 2G44. One can see that although all elements and spectral
ranges were calculated from equal electronic structure, there is very good agreement between all approaches in case
of 2p- and 3p-edges spectral range. On the other hand, agreement between G-spectra in visible range is much smaller
(particularly visible for Gs in Fe). This can be also seen on Fig. 1, where demonstrated example (Fe at 1.3 eV)
where, in case of both in-plane scan and out-of-plane scans, the values of e.g. εyy − εzz or εzz − εxx are shifted. The
discrepancy stems from the numerical precision of the Brillouin zone integration technique used to calculate optical
properties for photon energies below about 1–2 eV. For more details see the Appendix A.

Finally, recall, for isotropic materials Gs = 2G44. However, in 2p-edge and 3p-edge spectra, the peaks of 2G44
and Gs corresponding to L2,3 and M edges have roughly opposite signs, demonstrating very strong (dominating)
anisotropy of quadratic eﬀects in cubic bcc Fe, fcc Co and fcc Ni in their respective spectral ranges. Very strong

4

anisotropy signal in XMLD is demonstrated and analysed by both experimental and theoretical calculations at both
2p-edge and 3p-edge in case fo the bcc Fe [6, 27, 35]. Furthermore, Fig. 2 demonstrates (visible particularly for 3p-
edges) that light absorption (cid:61)(ε(0)) has form of sum of Lorentzian peaks. Then the absorption of linear element K is
roughly proportional to the ﬁrst derivation of ε(0): (cid:60)(K) ∼ ∂(cid:61)(ε(0))/∂E, and quadratic elements are approximately
proportional to second derivative of ε(0): (cid:61)(2G44), (cid:61)(Gs) ∼ ∂2(cid:61)(ε(0))/∂E2 [28]. Notice also diﬀerent spectral features
in both G-spectra, e.g., in case of Fe at 4.7 eV (or Ni at 1.9 eV), there is a strong peak in Gs spectra, but no such a
feature in 2G44 spectra. Similar can be told about feature for Ni at 0.4 eV, presented only in 2G44 spectra and absent
in Gs spectra.
Finally notice that for (001) oriented crystals, (a) the real/imaginary part of Gs is proportional to magnetic linear
birefringence/dichroism (MLB/MLD), respectively, with M (cid:107) [100]. Namely, it corresponds to diﬀerence of light
speed/absorption for E (cid:107) [100] and E (cid:107) [010]. Similarly, 2G44 is proportional to MLD/MLB with M (cid:107) [110], i.e.
E (cid:107) [110] and E (cid:107) [1 − 10]. This can be seen also seen on expressions of Gs and 2G44 using Kubo formula (5–6)
below. (b) In case of both M and E vectors laying in (001)-plane (i.e.
in-plane magnetization and normal light
incidence), the isotropic part of MLB/MLD, is proportional to the term (Gs + 2G44)/2, whereas the anisotropic part
of MLB/MLD (i.e. varying with crystallographic orientation) is given by ∆G = Gs − 2G44 [42].

III. ANALYTICAL QUANTUM-MECHANICAL DESCRIPTION

We express analytically all principal spectra (ε(0), K, Gs, 2G44) by quantum mechanical description (i.e. by modiﬁed
Kubo formula) within the electric dipole approximation. In Cartesian system deﬁned ˆx (cid:107) [100], ˆy (cid:107) [010], ˆz (cid:107) [001]
and for magnetization along M (cid:107) [001] direction, the absorption (dissipative) part is the well-known non-magnetic
(isotropic) term ε(0) = εzz is [43–45]

p, vector potential of the magnetic ﬁeld A and spin-orbit coupling between electron potential U and its spin σ, f (Ei),
f (Ef ) are occupation functions. The dispersive part of the dielectric functions are determined by Kramers-Kronig
relations [36]. Note that according to Tab. I, Eq. (3) calculates imaginary part of εzz = ε(0) +G11, not solely εzz = ε(0).
However, G11 can not be determined, as length of magnetization vector is constant for ferromagnetic materials. Hence,
G11 is inseparable part of ε(0) and we neglect it compared to ε(0).
When both magnetization and light propagation is along ˆz axis, M (cid:107) [001], then eigenmodes of light propagation
are circularly left and circularly right polarizations. Therefore, the linear term K is given as a diﬀerence of light
absorption for circularly-left and circularly-right polarizations as determined by Bruno et al [45]

In case magnetization is along M (cid:107) [100] direction (i.e. along ˆx), the symmetry arguments predict Gs = εxx − εyy

(Tab. I). By employing Eq. (3), Gs can be expressed as

(cid:88)
[f (Ef ) − f (Ei)](cid:0)|(cid:104)i|π · ˆx|f(cid:105)|2 − |(cid:104)i|π · ˆy|f(cid:105)|2(cid:1) δ(ω − ωf i) .

This equation corresponds to the case when light propagation is along ˆz axis and M (cid:107) ˆx, then eigenmodes of light
propagation are linearly polarized waves parallel and perpendicular to magnetization direction. Hence, the quadratic
term Gs is given by diﬀerence of absorptions for those two light polarizations.
Similarly, in Cartesian system deﬁned ˆx(cid:48) (cid:107) [110], ˆy(cid:48) (cid:107) [−110], ˆz(cid:48) (cid:107) [001] and for magnetization M (cid:107) [110], the
element 2G44 = εx(cid:48)x(cid:48) − εy(cid:48)y(cid:48) is expressed formally in the same way as Gs [41]. Transforming back to Cartesian system
ˆx (cid:107) [100], ˆy (cid:107) [010], ˆz (cid:107) [001], quadratic term 2G44 is expressed by diﬀerence of absorption of linear light polarization
along [110] and [1-10] directions when magnetization is along [110] (cid:107) ˆx + ˆy

Finally note, that here expressed Gs and 2G44 corresponds to principal spectra calculated from [100] and [110]
magnetization directions, as denoted in Tab. II and Figs. 2–4

IV. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we provide principal spectra, i.e. decomposition of isotropic, linear and quadratic contributions
in magnetization of magnetooptic eﬀects up to the second order in magnetization. The values of magnetooptic
permittivity elements are determined as weighted sum of principal spectra, where weights are determined solely by
magnetization direction. Although in X-ray range, this spectroscopy is already established, it was not introduced for
visible range. In case of ferromagnetic cubic crystals owning point symmetry, all magneto-transport up to second-
order eﬀects are described by spectra of four complex principal spectra, denoted ε0, K, Gs and 2G44, as predicted
by symmetry arguments. This approach expresses second-order magnetooptic properties as bulk material property,
independent on sample crystallographic orientation, layer thickness, structure details etc. The principal spectra were
expressed from ab-initio calculations for bcc Fe, fcc Co and fcc Ni. To extract principal spectra from ab-initio,
we have used two methods (i) by comparing ab-initio calculated angular dependence of the permittivity tensor,
with dependences predicted by symmetry arguments and (ii) using permittivity elements calculated for fundamental
symmetry magnetization directions. We also express principal spectra analytically using modiﬁed Kubo formula.
Although the spectroscopy presented here is for cubic crystals owning Oh point symmetry, it can also be simply
modiﬁed for materials with diﬀerent crystal symmetries, higher orders in magnetizations or even diﬀerent magneto-
transport eﬀects. We expect that experimental and theoretical determination of principal spectra will be routinely
used in magnetooptic spectroscopy of ferromagnetic materials.

Appendix A: Computational details

The angular dependence of εij on magnetization direction with respect to the crystal axes is determined by ab-
initio calculations. The electronic structure is determined by full potential linearised augmented plane wave method
(WIEN2k code [46]), where the exchange energy is based on local spin density approximation [47]. The spin-orbit
coupling was included in a second-variation scheme [48]. The following parameters were employed: the energy cutoﬀ,
given as the product of the muﬃn-tin radius and the maximum reciprocal space vector was RMTKmax = 8.5, the
largest reciprocal vector in the charge Fourier expansion, Gmax, was set to 14 Ry1/2, and the maximum value of
partial waves inside the muﬃn-tin spheres, lmax = 10. The Brillouin zone sampling was done on grid of 27×27×27
k-points, whereas for the optical transition matrix elements [49] a ﬁner grid of 81×81×81 was used. The optical
calculations are based on Kubo formula [44], with omitted Drude term, hence we do not present dc transport. At
present, also core-hole eﬀects are omitted. The lattice constants of studied materials are ﬁxed being a = 2.870˚A(bcc
Fe), a = 3.425˚A(fcc Co) and a = 3.420˚A(fcc Ni) [50].

The numerical precision shows to be limited for the beginning of the optical energy range below about 1–2 eV,i.e.
the states in vicinity of the Fermi level. There may be two reasons for it: (1) the calculated transition probabilities
are calculated for each pair of energy levels and for each k-point of the mesh of the reciprocal space. The integration
of the Kubo formula is implemented by Bl¨ochl-enhanced tetrahedron integration [51], which determines mean value of
a given property (e.g. transition probability) inside each tetrahedron. This mean value is calculated by weighted sum
of a given property at each corner of the tetrahedron, where the weights for each stationary state (i.e. for each energy
level) are calculated from eigenenergy of each k-point and value of the Fermi energy. This works well, when either
initial or ﬁnal tetrahedron are fully above or below Fermi level. However, in case when both initial and ﬁnal states are
within tetrahedrons cutting Fermi level, this approach may not work properly. This may explain, why dependence of
permittivity elements on magnetization direction for photon energy below 1–2 eV are rather diﬀerent from expected
symmetry dependence compared to those calculated for higher photon energies. (2) In Bl¨ochl-enhanced tetrahedron

diﬀerences of permittivity tensor elements on magnetization direction for (top line) in-plane scans and (bottom line) out-of-
plane scans. Line is ﬁt to dependence as predicted by symmetry arguments (Tab. I). Diagonal elements (blue) corresponds to
diﬀerence of diagonal permittivity elements εii − εjj, i (cid:54)= j, being proportional to Gs = G11 − G12. Lower triangle (green)
(εij + εji)/2 is proportional to linear magnetooptic K element. Upper triangle (red) (εij − εji)/2 is proportional to 2G44
element.

integration, the irreducible k-points are selected to fulﬁl that the symmetry operation copies those irreducible k-points
to all k points inside the unit cell of the reciprocal space. Obviously, in the case of high symmetry structure, such as
cubic crystal, the position of k-points in the unit cell follows most of symmetry operations. However, the integration
employs tetrahedrons, which does not follow so many symmetry operations. For example, in case of cubic crystal,
the rotation by 90◦ copy k-points to themselves, but the tetrahedrons are not copied to themselves. Therefore, the
numerical error of the integration from diﬀerent parts of the unit cell does not follow structural symmetry, which may
increase error described in the previous paragraph.

FIG. 2: Principal spectra of permittivity elements up to the second order in magnetization (ε(0), K, Gs = G11 − G12, 2G44)
for bcc Fe. Three spectral ranges are presented, extended visible range, 3p-edges and 2p-edges range. Spectra of second-order
elements Gs and 2G44 are determined by several ways, by (a) ﬁt to dependence of εij on magnetization direction and (b) from
permittivity tensor calculated for magnetization in fundamental directions [001], [011] and [111]. The principal spectra are
complex functions, top four lines show spectra parts (real or imaginary) related to the light absorption, bottom four lines show
spectra parts related with light dispersion.
