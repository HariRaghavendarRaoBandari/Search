Abstract

We consider the coupling of a free scalar to a single-trace operator of a large N CFT

in d dimensions. This is equivalent to a double-trace deformation coupling two primary

operators of the CFT, in the limit when one of the two saturates the unitarity bound.

At leading order, the RG-ﬂow has a non-trivial ﬁxed point where multiplets recombine.

We show this phenomenon in ﬁeld theory, and provide the holographic dual description.

Free scalars correspond to singleton representations of the AdS algebra. The double-trace

interaction is mapped to a boundary condition mixing the singleton with the bulk ﬁeld

dual to the single-trace operator.

In the IR, the singleton and the bulk scalar merge,

providing just one long representation of the AdS algebra.

Introduction and Summary

Renormalization Group (RG) ﬂow in Quantum Field Theory usually falls outside the

regime of validity of perturbation theory. However, if an expansion parameter is available,

like in the small- or the large-N expansion, it may become possible to follow operators

from the UV to the IR ﬁxed point, and have direct access to interesting phenomena

induced by the RG-ﬂow. One such example is multiplet recombination: a primary operator

that saturates the unitarity bound at the UV ﬁxed point recombines with another primary

operator, i.e. the latter ﬂows to a descendant of the ﬁrst at the IR ﬁxed point, and the

two distinct conformal families get mapped into a single one.

Recently, multiplet recombination was used to reproduce, via simple CFT arguments,

perturbative calculations of anomalous dimensions in the -expansion. This was ﬁrst done
for O(N ) scalar models in 4 −  dimensions [1], and later extended to the Gross-Neveu
model in 2 +  dimensions [2,3]. In these examples, the short operator is a boson/fermion

saturating the unitarity bound, which becomes long at the interacting ﬁxed point due to

its equations of motion.

In this paper we will consider multiplet recombination in large-N theories having a

gravity dual description. Intuitively, holography should map multiplet recombination to a

Higgs mechanism in the bulk. Indeed, when the protected operator is a conserved current

that recombines due to a deformation that breaks the symmetry, the dual bulk gauge ﬁeld

is Higgsed and gets a mass. Here we will discuss the case in which the protected operator

is a free scalar φ, and couple it to a single-trace operator O of the large-N CFT via the

interaction(cid:82) ddx φ O. We will see that also in this case there is a Higgs-like mechanism

at work, albeit of a diﬀerent kind, which exists only in AdS.

In order to study this problem, we ﬁnd it useful to start considering two CFT single-

trace operators (O1, O2) of dimension (∆1, ∆2) with ∆1 + ∆2 < d, and thereafter take the
decoupling limit ∆1 → d

2 − 1. The relevant double-trace deformation

(cid:90)

ddx f O1O2 ,

(1.1)

leads to an IR ﬁxed point where (O1, O2) are replaced by two operators ( ˜O1, ˜O2) of di-
mension (d − ∆1, d − ∆2), respectively. In the limit ∆1 → d
2 − 1, many terms in the low
energy limit of the correlators become analytical in the momentum, and can be removed

by appropriate counterterms. Focusing on the physical part of the correlators, we will
ﬁnd that in this case multiplets recombine. In particular, ˜O1 ∝ (cid:3) ˜O2, the IR dimensions

1

being related as

with ∆IR

2 = d − ∆2.

∆IR

1 = ∆IR

2 + 2 ,

(1.2)

In the bulk the interaction (1.1) gets mapped into a non scale-invariant boundary

condition for the scalar ﬁelds (Φ1, Φ2) dual to (O1, O2) [4, 5] (see also [6–10]). These bulk
scalars are free at leading order in 1/N expansion. The presence of the coupling f implies

that the boundary modes of Φ1 and Φ2 get mixed. For O1 and O2 above the unitarity
bound, the holographic analysis is standard, and the results agree with the ﬁeld theory
analysis. The limit ∆1 → d
2 − 1 should instead be treated with some care. One needs to
rescale the ﬁeld Φ1, otherwise the normalization of the two-point correlator of O1 would
vanish. Doing so, one sees that the on-shell action for Φ1 reduces to the action of a free
scalar ﬁeld living on the boundary of AdS, i.e. a singleton [11–15]. In the IR limit of

the holographic RG-ﬂow triggered by (1.1), the singleton gets identiﬁed with a boundary

mode of Φ2 corresponding to the VEV of the dual operator, i.e. the singleton becomes a
long multiplet by eating-up the degrees of freedom of the bulk scalar.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we perform the large-N ﬁeld

theory analysis, and show that recombination takes place in the limit ∆1 → d
section 3 we review the singleton limit in the bulk, and derive the holographic dual of the

2 − 1. In

multiplet recombination ﬂow. We conclude with some comments on relations to previous

work and possible future directions. The appendix contains the calculation of the variation
of the quantity ˜F [16] induced by the ﬂow (1.1), which shows that δ ˜F = ˜FU V − ˜FIR > 0,
in agreement with the generalized F-theorem advocated in [16, 17].

2 Large-N Multiplet Recombination: Field Theory

Consider a free scalar φ coupled to a large-N CFT through the interaction

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

ddxf φ O ,

(2.1)

where O is a single-trace primary operator of dimension ∆ < d

2 +1, so that the deformation

(2.1) is relevant and triggers an RG-ﬂow.

At leading order in the large-N expansion, one can integrate out the CFT sector and

get the following non-local kinetic term for the scalar φ

ddx f 2φ(−(cid:3))∆− d

2 φ .

(2.2)

2

This term is dominant in the IR, indicating that φ ﬂows to an operator of dimension
φ = d − ∆.
In fact, the equation of motion for φ tells that in the IR O = f−1(cid:3)φ
∆IR
O = d − ∆ + 2. Therefore, in the IR O
becomes a descendant of φ with dimension ∆IR
disappears from the spectrum of primary operators, multiplets recombine, and the short

multiplet of φ becomes long.

As we will see, in order to understand the holographic dual phenomenon, it is useful

to consider this ﬂow as the limit of a double-trace ﬂow induced by f O1O2 when the
dimension of O1 saturates the unitarity bound. In the following subsections we review
this double-trace ﬂow and show that multiplet recombination emerges in the limit.

2.1 Double-trace ﬂow

Let us consider a large-N CFT deformed by the double-trace interaction

ddx f O1O2 ,

(2.3)

2 − 1 <
2 . Without loss of generality we will take ∆1 < ∆2 in what follows. One can

where (O1, O2) are single-trace primary operators of dimensions (∆1, ∆2), with d
∆1,2 < d
conveniently analyze the perturbed CFT

S = SCF T +

ddx f O1O2 ,

(2.4)

by introducing two Hubbard-Stratonovich auxiliary ﬁelds σ1 and σ2, and rewrite S as

(cid:90)

ddx(cid:0)−f−1 σ1σ2 + σ1O1 + σ2O2

(cid:1) .

S = SCF T +

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

(2.5)

(2.6)

Integrating σ1 and σ2 out gives the following relations

σ1 = f O2 ,

σ2 = f O1 ,

which, once substituted back into (2.5), give the original action (2.4).

By performing the path integral in the CFT, one can derive an eﬀective action for σ1
and σ2. To leading order at large N all correlators of O1 and O2 factorize in a product of
two-point functions. The resulting non-local eﬀective action for the auxiliary ﬁelds is

(cid:90)

(cid:18)

S[σ1, σ2] =

(cid:19)

(2.7)

(x − y)2∆2

σ2(y)

.

Given that ∆1 and ∆2 are smaller than d
2 , the latter two terms dominate over the ﬁrst,
in the infrared. When only these terms are retained, σ1 and σ2 have IR correlators
corresponding to operators with scaling dimension d − ∆1 and d − ∆2, respectively.
Substituting (2.6), we hence obtain the following operators at the IR ﬁxed point

˜O1 = f O2, ∆IR
˜O2 = f O1, ∆IR

1 = d − ∆1 ,
2 = d − ∆2 .

(2.8a)

(2.8b)

The above result shows that the IR ﬁxed point is the same as the one reached via the
double-trace deformation g1O2
2 [4]. This will be conﬁrmed by the computation of
the quantity ˜F [16] we do in the Appendix, where we show that the diﬀerence between
the UV and IR values of ˜F induced by the ﬂow (2.3) coincides with the one induced by
the double-trace deformation g1O2

1 + g2O2

1 + g2O2
2.

2.2 Multiplet recombination

2 − 1, which means that O1 decouples and becomes a free scalar, and

We now take ∆1 = d
consider again the perturbation (2.3) and the corresponding eﬀective action (2.7). The
(x−y)d−2 , which is the inverse of the

1

kernel of the non-local quadratic action for σ1 is now
Laplace operator. By the local change of variable
1 = σ1 − f−1(cid:3)σ2 ,
σ(cid:48)

σ(cid:48)
2 = σ2 ,

(2.9)

one can cancel the mixing term in the action (2.7), getting for the two-point function of
1 just the contact term (cid:3)δd(x − y). Therefore, the following operator equation holds
σ(cid:48)

1 = 0 ⇒ σ1 = f−1(cid:3)σ2 .
σ(cid:48)

(2.10)

Using (2.6), (2.8a) and (2.8b), we obtain the following operator relation at the IR ﬁxed

point

˜O1 = f−1(cid:3) ˜O2 ,

(2.11)

signaling that multiplets recombine, i.e. ˜O1 becomes a descendant of ˜O2. Recall from
eq. (2.8b) that ˜O2 = f O1 has dimension d − ∆2 and, by (2.11), ˜O1 = f O2 has now
dimension d − ∆2 + 2.

1 − g1σ2

2

(cid:1) + σ1O1 + σ2O2

(cid:21)

.

(2.13)

Following the same steps as those of section 2.1, one ends-up with the following primary

operators in the IR

˜O1 = g1O1 + f O2, ∆IR
˜O2 = g2O2 + f O1, ∆IR

1 = d − ∆1 ,
2 = d − ∆2 .

(2.14a)

(2.14b)

This shows that the IR ﬁxed point is the same one reaches via the simpler deformation

(2.3), just the UV/IR operator dictionary is modiﬁed. So nothing qualitatively changes

with respect to the previous analysis.

Here again, one can safely take the decoupling limit ∆1 → d

2 − 1, getting a relation

similar to (2.11), the proportionality coeﬃcient being now a function of f, g1 and g2

˜O1 =

f

(f 2 − g1g2)

2 ˜O2 .

(2.15)

So multiplets recombine also for this more general deformation. Notice that here the free

operator is a massive one, its mass being proportional to g1. Not suprisingly, for f = 0
the deformation (2.12) does not trigger any multiplet recombination, as it is also clear

from eq. (2.15). The (massive) free operator simply gets integrated out, while O2 still
ﬂows to an operator of dimension d − ∆2.
Let us note that had we have chosen d

2 would have been an irrelevant
deformation. This would not change much the story. Since one can always connect a
CFT with ∆2 > d
2 via an RG-ﬂow with only g2 turned on, there is no
loss of generality in taking g2 to be a relevant coupling, as we did from the outset.

2 to one with ∆2 < d

2 < ∆2 < d, O2

1A similar quadratic interaction involving several single-trace operators was studied recently in the

context of large-N ﬁeld theory in presence of disorder [18].

5

As it is clear from eq.(2.13), the hypersurface in the parameter space described by
the equation f 2 − g1g2 = 0 needs a separate treatment. It is not diﬃcult to see that in
this case only one linear combination of the operators renormalizes, the IR dimensions of
˜O1 and ˜O2 being d − ∆1 and ∆2, respectively (the symmetry in the exchange g1 ↔ g2 is
broken by the fact that we have chosen ∆1 < ∆2). This is a diﬀerent IR ﬁxed point with
respect to previous cases. Actually, the same ﬁxed point one reaches by deforming the
CFT by g1 only. Also in this special case one can take the decoupling limit, ∆1 → d
2 − 1.
Proceeding the same way as before, one can see that the dimensions of ˜O1 and ˜O2 are now
∆2 + 2 and ∆2, respectively, indicating that multiplet recombination again holds. The IR
ﬁxed point is the same one reaches with a g1 deformation only, which makes the free ﬁeld
disappearing from the IR spectrum, leaving only one primary of dimension ∆2.

3 Large-N Multiplet Recombination: Holography

In this section we will analyze the large-N ﬂows considered previously from a dual holo-

graphic perspective. Free operators of the QFT are dual to singleton representations of

the AdS isometry group [13, 14] and some care is needed in dealing with them in the con-

text of AdS/CFT. In particular, singletons do not enjoy any dynamics in the bulk. They

correspond to propagating degrees of freedom only at the AdS boundary, and therefore

the usual ﬁeld/operator map should be properly interpreted. In what follows, we will ﬁrst

review how singletons can actually arise as a speciﬁc limit of ordinary bulk ﬁelds and how

QFT correlators involving operators saturating the unitarity bound can then be consis-

tently computed holographically using ordinary AdS/CFT techniques. This will enable us

to provide a holographic realization of QFT RG-ﬂows enjoying multiplet recombination

at large N .

3.1 Singleton Limit
Consider a scalar Φ in AdSd+1 with mass m2 = ∆(∆− d), and ∆ = d
2 − 1 + η. Eventually,
we will be interested in the limit η → 0. To leading order at large N the scalar is free,
and solving the Klein-Gordon equation we have the leading modes at the boundary

Φ(z, x) ∼
z→0

(Φ−(x)z∆ + Φ+(x)zd−∆)(1 + O(z2)) ,

(3.1)

where z is the radial coordinate that vanishes at the boundary and x ∈ Rd. Since ∆ < d
2 ,
the correct boundary condition is that (d− 2∆)Φ+(x) is ﬁxed to coincide with the source
of the operator of the boundary theory: J(x) ≡ (d − 2∆)Φ+(x). This implies, in turn,
that one needs to include an additional boundary term to ensure that the bulk action

is stationary [19]. After this is done, the renormalized on-shell action consists of the

following boundary term in momentum space

3.2 Holographic Recombination Flow

We have now all ingredients to provide the holographic description of the large-N ﬂows

discussed in section 2. We start considering two primary operators of the CFT with
dimensions ∆1,2 < d
2 . The CFT operators are dual to two scalar bulk ﬁelds Φ1, Φ2 having
the following near boundary expansions

needs to add the following local term to the above generating functional

gets precisely the Fourier transform of (2.7), provided we identify the ﬁeld theory coupling

and pick the negative root for fhol (it is generic in AdS/CFT that ﬁeld theory couplings
diﬀer from holographic ones by such overall normalizations). After these identiﬁcations,

one can repeat the analysis of section 2.1 and obtain eqs. (2.8).

In order to describe the phenomenon of multiplet recombination holographically, one

has just to repeat the above analysis taking the singleton limit on the ﬁeld Φ1, ﬁrst. One
ˆJ1, rescale also the
should hence set ∆1 = d
ˆf , and eventually take the limit η → 0, with the hatted quantities
coupling as f = 1√
kept ﬁxed. Doing so, and repeating previous steps one gets, eventually, equation (2.11).

2 − 1 + η, rescale the source of O1 as J1 = 1√

Below, we ﬁnd it instructive to adopt yet another (but equivalent) point of view. Instead

of working with the eﬀective action for (σ1, σ2) we will work with the generating functional
(3.14) itself. After the singleton limit the on-shell action, analogous to (3.14), reads

(3.19)

This equation shows that, as a result of the interaction f , the VEV mode of the bulk
scalar gets identiﬁed with the singleton ˆΦ−
1 , and its original VEV mode is now obtained
by applying (cid:3) to ˆΦ−
1 . This is the hallmark signature of multiplet recombination. Notice,
ﬁnally, that in the IR the behavior of the two-point function of the leftover primary
operator is (cid:104) ˜O2
˜O2(cid:105) ∝ kd−2∆2, implying that at the IR ﬁxed point we have a primary of
dimension ∆IR = d − ∆2, in agreement with ﬁeld theory analysis.

Summarizing, when f = 0 there are two independent modes, i.e. the singleton ˆΦ−
1 ,
which is just a boundary degree of freedom, and an ordinary bulk scalar, Φ2. They are
associated to two independent sources, ˆJ1(k) and J2(k). In contrast, at the IR AdS point,
there exists only one independent source, ˆJ1(k) − 1
2J2(k) and in turn only one scalar.
Φ2 and the singleton merge into one bulk scalar whose VEV mode is ˆΦ−
1 .

In this paper we have described multiplet recombination induced by coupling a large-

N CFT in d dimensions to a free sector. Working at leading order in 1/N we obtain

two equivalent descriptions of the phenomenon, the ﬁeld theoretic and the holographic

one. Let us comment on the relation with previous work on multiplet recombination in

holography, and indicate some possible future directions.

Multiplet recombination in AdS5/CFT4 was studied in [20–23]. In that case the re-
combination is not due to an RG-ﬂow, rather it occurs as one moves away from the free
point gY M = 0 of N = 4 SYM on the line of the marginal coupling, and the higher-spin
currents of the free theory are broken. Another instance of higher-spin multiplet recom-

bination is the case of O(N ) vector models in AdS4/CFT3 [24, 25]. The holographic dual
description consists in a Higgs mechanism for the higher-spin gauge ﬁelds dual to the

higher-spin currents of the free theory. The Higgs mechanism happens at tree-level in the
example of N = 4 SYM, while it is a 1/N eﬀect for the O(N ) vector models.

The crucial diﬀerence between these examples and our setting is that in these examples
one starts with N (cid:29) 1 free ﬁelds with a singlet condition, while we are considering only

10

one free ﬁeld. For this reason, in our setting there are no higher-spin gauge ﬁelds in the

bulk. We only have higher spin currents associated to the singleton and supported on the

boundary, and those are broken by the boundary condition.

A natural follow-up of our work would be to consider fermionic operators, along the

lines of [26, 27], and study the analogous singleton limit and recombination in the bulk

due to the boundary condition.

The idea of multiplet recombination has been applied extensively in the literature in

various contexts, to compute anomalous dimensions [1–3, 28–32], to constrain the form of

three-point functions [33], or to ﬁnd exactly marginal deformations [34]. In these examples

one works perturbatively in a small parameter that controls the breaking of the shortening

condition. In the case we consider, instead, the recombination happens at leading order

in 1/N , so we cannot apply these methods to obtain more information about the IR ﬁxed

point. It would be interesting to consider a set-up in which the shortening is violated by

a multi-trace operator with a suppressed coupling at large N , as would follow for instance

from an interaction (cid:82) ddxφ O2, and see if similar techniques could instead be used in

that case. Another open problem is to try to use multiplet recombination to compute
anomalous dimensions in the IR ﬁxed point of QED in d = 4 − 2 [35, 36].

We hope to report on some of these issues in the future.

A Calculation of δ ˜F for the double-trace ﬂow f O1O2

In the following, we compute the leading large-N variation of ˜F induced by the ﬂow
(1.1). The quantity ˜F can be deﬁned in a CFT where the dimension d is promoted to a
continuous parameter, and interpolates between the sphere free energy in odd dimensions

and the a anomaly in even dimensions [16]. In [16] several examples were provided for
which ˜F decreases towards the IR, suggesting a generalization of the a- and F-theorems
to continuous dimensions. In particular, it was proven that the generalized F-theorem

The quantity of interest is deﬁned as ˜F = sin(cid:0) πd

Comparing (A.5) with eq. (3.4) in [16], we see that this coincides with the variation of
˜F induced by the deformation g1O2
2. This agrees with the fact that the deforma-
tions f O1O2 and g1O2
2 connect the same UV and IR ﬁxed points. In [16, 37] the
logarithm of the functional determinant was evaluated via an appropriate regularization

(A.6)

which is again a positive quantity if d

2 , since ˜Fscalar > 0 [16]. This equation
reﬂects the fact that along the ﬂow the free scalar and the primary single-trace operator of

dimension ∆2 recombine, giving in the IR one primary single-trace operator of dimension
d − ∆2.

The upshot is then that the generalized F-theorem holds for the double-trace defor-

mation (2.3), and it does so also when multiplets recombine.
