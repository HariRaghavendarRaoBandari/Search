SPINNING DUST EMISSION FROM ULTRASMALL SILICATES: EMISSIVITY AND POLARIZATION

Thiem Hoang1, Nguyen Anh Vinh2, and Nguyen Quynh Lan2

SPECTRUM

Draft version March 18, 2016

ABSTRACT

Anomalous microwave emission (AME) is an important Galactic foreground of Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) radiation. It is believed that the AME arises from rotational emission by spinning
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the interstellar medium (ISM). In this paper, we assume
that a population of ultrasmall silicate grains may exist in the ISM, and quantify rotational emissivity
from these tiny particles and its polarization spectrum. We found that spinning silicate nanoparticles
can produce strong rotational emission when those small grains follow a log-normal size distribution.
The polarization fraction of spinning dust emission from tiny silicates increases with decreasing the
dipole moment per atom (β) and can reach P ∼ 20% for β ∼ 0.1D at grain temperature of 60 K.
We identify a parameter space (β, YSi) for silicate nanoparticles in which its rotational emission can
adequately reproduce both the observed AME and the polarization of the AME, without violating
the observational constraints by the ultraviolet extinction and polarization of starlight. Our results
reveal that rotational emission from spinning silicate may be an important source of the AME.

1. INTRODUCTION

Anomalous microwave emission (AME) in the ∼ 10–
60 GHz frequency range is a new,
important Galac-
tic foreground component, which was discovered about
20 years ago (Kogut et al. 1996; Leitch et al. 1997).
Two new emission processes have been proposed to
explain the AME,
including spinning dust emission
(Draine & Lazarian 1998, hereafter DL98) from rapidly
spinning ultrasmall grains and magnetic dipole emis-
sion (hereafter MDE)
from magnetic nanoparticles
(Draine & Lazarian 1999, hereafter DL99).3

In the spinning dust emission paradigm, the emissiv-
ity is determined mostly by three principal parameters,
including permanent dipole moment, rotation rate, and
the abundance of spinning ultrasmall grains (Erickson
1957; DL98; Ali-Ha¨ımoud et al. 2009; Hoang et al. 2010,
hereafter HDL10). In that sense, any nanoparticles hav-
ing permanent dipole moment would produce rotational
emission because the nanoparticles of any kind naturally
rotate due to gas-grain collisions and absorption of ul-
traviolet (UV) photons.

Since the introduction of spinning dust emission,
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (hereafter PAHs) are
taken to be the unique carrier of rotational emis-
sion, because their existence in the interstellar medium
was well established (Leger & Puget 1984; see review
by Tielens 2008).
Theoretical models with spin-
ning PAHs have proved to be successfully in re-
producing the observational data from both ground-
based experiments (Finkbeiner et al. 2004) and satel-

3 In this paper, tiny particles, ultrasmall particles, and nanopar-
ticles are interchangeable, which refers to dust grains of size below
10nm (100˚A).

(Hoang et al. 2011; Planck Collaboration et al.
lites
2011; Planck Collaboration et al. 2013).
In particular,
Tibbs et al. (2016) recently show that the 1 cm CARMA
data from dense cores do not follow the extrapolation of
thermal dust radiation and can be ﬁtted with spinning
dust emission.

Aiming to test the hypothesis of rotation emission from
spinning PAHs as a source of the AME, Hensley et al.
(2015) have carried out an analysis using full-sky AME
data from Planck and the all-sky WISE data.
Sur-
prisingly, they found no correlation between the PAH
abundance and the AME, casting doubt on PAHs as
the underlying carrier.
It is suggested that the AME
may be produced by spinning non-PAH nanoparticles
(Hensley et al. 2015), or that the physics of interstellar
PAHs is diﬀerent from the one adopted in spinning dust
model (Hoang & Lazarian 2015). This encourages us to
search for unexplored possibilities that may be important
for the AME.

Recently, Hoang & Lazarian (2015) have quantiﬁed ro-
tational emission from spinning iron particles that have
intrinsic magnetic dipole moments due to spontaneous
magnetization. They found that the rotational emissiv-
ity is one order of magnitude lower than that produced
by spinning PAHs even when all iron abundance is con-
centrated within free-ﬂying nanoparticles. Interestingly,
their detailed calculations show that the polarization of
magnetic dipole emission from free-ﬂiers is low, which
suggests a more important role of free-ﬂying nanoparti-
cles as the AME than previously thought.

The study of this present paper is based on the assump-
tion that there may exist a new population of nanopar-
ticles in the the interstellar medium (ISM), namely sil-
icate nanoparticles, in addition to PAHs and potential
iron nanoparticles. Since nano silicates can have per-
manent electric dipole moments (see Section 2), we ex-
pect those spinning nanoparticles will produce consider-
able rotational emission if their abundance is suﬃciently

2

large.

Hoang, Vinh, & Lan

The presence of ultrasmall silicate grains in the ISM re-
mains a hypothesis, in contrast to PAHs where their exis-
tence is demonstrated by the 2175˚A extinction bump and
mid-infrared (IR) emission features (see Draine 2011).
The ﬁrst estimate by D´esert et al. (1986) shows that the
fraction of total Si abundance (Si/H= 3.6 × 10−5) con-
tained in ultrasmall grains, denoted by YSi, is less than
1%. However, a later analysis by Li & Draine (2001)
shows that YSi can reach ∼ 10% without violating the
observational constraints of the UV starlight extinction
and mid-IR emission.
If silicate nanoparticles are in-
deed present in the ISM, their rotational emission will
certainly contribute to the AME. The goal of this pa-
per is to employ our advanced spinning model (HDL10;
Hoang et al. 2011, hereafter HLD11) to quantify the ro-
tational emissivity from silicate nanoparticles and to con-
strain its physical parameters required to reproduce the
observed AME in the ISM.

Our paper is structured as follows.

In Section 2 we
brieﬂy describe grain properties including electric dipole
moments of silicate material.
Section 3 presents an
overview of spinning dust emission mechanism. Section 4
is devoted to description of rotational damping and exci-
tation of silicate grains, and numerical methods. Results
for spinning silicate emission and polarization spectra are
presented in Section 5. An extended discussion on impli-
cations of rotational emission from spinning silicate for
the AME, the AME polarization, and UV polarization of
starlight are presented in Section 6. The principal results
are then summarized in Section 7.

2. GRAIN PROPERTIES OF ULTRASMALL SILICATES

2.1. Grain shape and size

We consider oblate spheroidal grains with moments of
inertia I1 > I2 = I3 along the grain principal axes de-
noted by ˆa1, ˆa2 and ˆa3. Let Ik = I1 and I⊥ = I2 = I3.
They take the following forms:

Ik =

8π
15

ρa1a4

2, I⊥ =

4π
15

ρa2

2a1(cid:0)a2

where a1 and a2 = a3 are the lengths of the semiminor
and semimajor axes of the oblate spheroid with axial
ratio s = a1/a2 < 1, and ρ is the grain material density.
The eﬀective grain size a is deﬁned as the radius of an
equivalent sphere of the same volume, which is given by

(1)

a =(cid:18) 3

4π

(4π/3)a1a2

2(cid:19)1/3

= a2s1/3.

(2)

Assuming that all Si, Mg, and Fe abundance is
present in dust grains to form the typical structure
M g1.1F e0.9SiO4, the grain material density corresponds
to ρ ≈ 4 g cm−3. The number of Si atoms is related to
the grain size a as NSi = 59.67a3
−7, and the total number
of atoms is N = 7NSi = 417.74a3
−7.

2.2. Electric dipole moment

The rotational emission mechanism is built upon the
fact that nanoparticles have non-zero dipole moments.
Since the speciﬁc composition of ultrasmall silicate is
uncertain, its electric dipole moment is rather arbitrary.
For instance, a SiO molecule can have a large electric

dipole moment of µ = 3.098D, which corresponds to a
dipole moment per atom β = 1.098D. A SiC has a larger
dipole moment of µ = 5.6D. Moreover, the dipole mo-
ments of pyroxene structures, enstatite (MgSiO3) and
ferrosilite (FeSiO3), are µ = 12.2D and 9.5D, respec-
tively (see Saunders & Plane 2011). Thus, we expect sil-
icate nanoparticles can have quite large dipole moment.
Table 1 lists the electric dipole moment (µ) of selected
bonds and molecules and the dipole per atom (β).

Let assume that N atoms in the grain have random dis-
tribution, then the intrinsic dipole moment of the grain
can be estimated using the random walk for the orienta-
tion of individual dipoles:

µ2
i = N β2 = 66.84(β/0.4D)2a3

−7D2.

(3)

Also, when ultrasmall silicate grains exhibit some
asymmetric charge distribution in which the grain charge
centroid is displaced from its center of mass, the net
dipole moment is non-zero. Thus, the total electric dipole
moment of the grain can be written as (DL98):

µ2 = µ2

where hZ 2i1/2 is the rms value of the grain charge, and
ǫ is a parameter taken to be 0.1 as in DL98.

3. OVERVIEW OF SPINNING DUST EMISSION

MECHANISM FROM WOBBLING GRAINS

Consider a grain with dipole moment µ ﬁxed in the
grain body rotating with angular momentum J. If the
grain only spins around its symmetry axis ˆa1 (ˆa1kJ),
then the spinning dipole moment emits radiation at a
unique frequency ν equal to the rotational frequency, i.e.,
ν = ω/2π (DL98). The power emission by the spinning
grain at frequency ν is

⊥ω4

Ped =(cid:18) 2µ2

3c3 (cid:19) ,

(5)

where µ⊥ is the component of µ perpendicular to the
rotation axis.

For more realistic rotation with ˆa1 misaligned from J
(HDL10; HLD11), an isolated grain of conserved J essen-
tially emits radiation at four frequency modes, which are
a function of J and the angle θ between ˆa1 and J. Fol-
lowing HLD11, the four frequency modes are described
by

ωmi = Ω(1 + i(h − 1) cos θ),

(6)

(7)

ωn1 = Ω(1 − h) cos θ,
with i = 0,±1, h = Ik/I⊥, and Ω = J/Ik.
Due to thermal ﬂuctuations within the grain, the an-
gle θ changes rapidly, which results in the wobbling of
the grain with respect to J (see the next section). For
the case of eﬃcient internal relaxation (see HLD11 for
details), the thermal ﬂuctuations of θ can be described
by a distribution function:

fLTE(θ, J) ∝ exp(cid:18) J 2

2IkkTd (cid:2)1 + (h − 1) sin θ2(cid:3)(cid:19) sin θ,(8)

where Td is the dust grain temperature, and fLTE(θ, J)dθ
describes the probability of ﬁnding θ between θ, θ + dθ
for given J.

The grain angular momentum changes randomly due
to a variety of interaction processes (see DL98) and is
described by a distribution function fJ (J), for which
fJ (J)dJ indicates the probability of ﬁnding the grain
angular momentum between J, J + dJ.

The rotational emissivity at observation frequency ν
(ω/(2π)) from a grain of size a is obtained by integrating
the power emission over the angular momentum distri-
bution and summing over all emission modes:

where µk = µ cos θ, µ⊥ = µ cos θ, the lower and upper
limits of J are determined by cos θ = −1 and 1 from
setting ωk equal to the observed frequency ω, cos θm+1 =
(−ω/Ω + h)/(h− 1), cos θm−1 = (ω/Ω− h)/(h− 1) (using
Eqs. 6), and pdfk(ω|J) is the probability of ﬁnding the
emission at frequency ω by mode ωk.
It is straightforward to obtain Jl = Ikω/(2h − 1) and
Ju = Ikω for m+1 mode, Ju = Ikω/(2h− 1) and Jl = Ikω
for m−1 mode, and Jl = Ikω/(h − 1) and Ju = ∞ for n1
mode.

The probability pdfk(ω|J) is given by (HLD11):

pdfm±1 = fLTE(θ, J) ±1

pdfn1 = fLTE(θ, J)

(11)

where fLTE is given by Equation (8). It is easy to see
that the second and third term in Equation 9 is the same
because (1 + cos θm+1)2 = (1 − cos θm−1)2.
The rotational emissivity from all spinning ultrasmall
grains is calculated by integrating over the grain size dis-
tribution dn/da:

3

where amin = 0.35nm and amax = 10nm are assumed, as
in previous works (DL98; HDL10).

Therefore, the calculations of rotational emissivity de-
pend essentially on the dipole moment µ, the distribution
function fJ , and dn/da. In the following, we will discuss
a bit more detail for spinning silicate grains.

4. ROTATIONAL DYNAMICS AND NUMERICAL METHOD

The discussion on rotational dynamics of silicate
nanoparticles in this section is in analogy to that of spin-
ning PAHs, which is presented in detail in DL98 and
HDL10. Below, we provide a brief description for refer-
ence.

4.1. Rotational Damping and Excitation Coeﬃcients

Rotational damping and excitation for dust grains, in
general, arise from collisions between grains and gaseous
atoms followed by the evaporation of atoms/molecules
from the grain surface, absorption of starlight and IR
emission (DL98; HDL10).
If the grain possesses elec-
tric dipole moment, the distant interaction of the grain
electric dipole with passing ions results in an additional
eﬀect, namely plasma drag. The rotational damping and
excitation for these processes are described by the dimen-
sionless damping coeﬃcient F and excitation coeﬃcient
G, respectively (see HDL10 for more detail).

For calculations of the F and G coeﬃcients, one needs
to know the charge distribution fZ of nano silicates. As
in Hoang & Lazarian (2012), we ﬁnd fZ by solving the
ionization equilibrium equations that takes into account
collisional charging (Draine & Sutin 1987) by sticking
collisions with electrons and ions and charging by photoe-
mission (Weingartner & Draine 2001). Dielectric func-
tion of astronomical silicate is adopted for nano silicates.
Moreover, rotational emission by electric dipole mo-
ment results in the rotational damping. The character-
istic damping time due to dipole emission τed depends
on the dipole moment β2 (see Appendix A). We assume
that the electric dipole is assumed to be in the plane per-
pendicular to the grain symmetry axis. It is noted that,
as found in HDL10, the diﬀerence with the result from
the case of isotropic orientation is small, within 10%, be-
cause strong internal ﬂuctuations average out the dipole
orientation with J.

Figure 1 shows the obtained values of F and G for
various processes for silicate grains in the cold neu-
tral medium (CNM; gas density nH = 30 cm−3, ioniza-
tion fraction xH = 10−3 cm−3, and temperature Tgas =
100 K) computed for an oblate spheroidal grain rotat-
ing along its symmetry axis. As shown, IR emission is
dominant for rotational damping of small grains (a <
0.05 µm), and neutral collisions are dominant for rota-
tional damping/excitation for larger grains. Ion collisions
dominate rotational excitation for ultrasmall grains be-
cause such grains are negatively charged due to sticking
collisions with electrons that outperform photoelectric
emission.

with zero mean and unit variance and g(ξn, ηn) = ξn/2 +

For silicate nanoparticles and PAHs with eﬃcient
rotational emission, the timestep h is determined es-
sentially by the two timescales, the shortest one τed
and the long one τgas, which is chosen as h =
0.01 min[1/Ftot,k, 1/Gtot,k, τed,k/τH,k, 1/δm]. A ﬁxed in-
tegration time T = 103τgas is chosen, which ensures that
T is much larger than the longest dynamical timescale
to provide good statistical calculations of the degrees of
grain alignment. As usual, the initial grain angular mo-
mentum is assumed to have random orientation in the
space and magnitude J = IkωT (i.e., j = 1). The so-
lutions Jx, Jy, Jz at each timestep are tabulated to ﬁnd
the grain angular momentum distribution function fJ
and degree of alignment (see the next section).

J and B (see Figure 9). The angle brackets denote the
average over the ensemble of grains. The net degree of

factor, is deﬁned as R = hGX GJi.
The angular momentum J and the angle ζ between
J and B obtained from the Langevin equations are em-
ployed to compute the degrees of alignment, QJ and R.
For instance, the Raleigh reduction factor R is calculated

. Here
we take Y max
Si = 20, 20, 30% for σ = 0.3, 0.6 and 0.6 es-
timated from Li & Draine (2001). A range of the dipole
moment β from 0.1 to 1D is considered. As β increases,
the peak emissivity increases while the peak frequency
decreases as a result of the stronger rotational damp-
ing by electric dipole emission. In addition, for a ﬁxed
a0 = 0.3nm, the peak emissivity decreases as σ increases
from 0.3 to 0.6 due to the increase in the peak size of
nanoparticles ap. The peak emissivity is slightly larger
for the case Td = 60K due to the additional excitation
arising from magnetic ﬂuctuations (see Appendix B).

Figure 4 shows the polarization fraction of the rota-
tional emission (p(ν) = qν/jν) for similar realizations in
Figure 3. The magnetic ﬁeld direction is assumed in the
plane of the sky (γB = 0). Colder spinning silicates tend
to generate stronger polarized emission due to weaker
internal thermal ﬂuctuations. Interestingly, we can see
that the larger dipole β results in a small polarization
fraction. This is because the larger dipole induces faster
electric dipole damping. This lowers substantially the
rms angular momentum of grains and reduces the de-
gree of grain alignment, according to the magnetic align-
ment mechanism. For considerable values of β ≥ 0.4D,
the peak polarization fraction is essentially below 10%.
However, for β < 0.4D, the peak polarization can reach
5 − 15% for ν = 20 − 60GHZ.

6. DISCUSSION

6.1. Can rotational emission from spinning silicate

reproduce the AME?

Spinning dust emission is a new mechanism to pro-
duce microwave rotational emission, which essentially de-
pends on the permanent dipole moment, rotation rate,
and the abundance of ultrasmall grains (DL98; HDL10).
In that sense, any nanoparticles owning a permanent
dipole moment will produce rotational emission, because
nanoparticles of any kind always spin due to gas-grain
collisions and UV photon absorption. Previous works
have quantiﬁed rotational emission by spinning PAHs
(DL98; HDL10; HLD11) and spinning iron nanoparti-
cles (Hoang & Lazarian 2015).
In this paper, we have
quantiﬁed rotational emission from a potential dust pop-
ulation, so-called silicate nanoparticles.

Si

Assuming a log-normal size distribution for silicate
nanoparticles with maximum Si abundance contained
in ultrasmall grains Y max
= 20%, we ﬁnd that the
spinning dust emissivity can span jν /nH ∼ 10−18 −
10−16Jy cm2/ sr/H, which can even exceed the AME
level of jobs ∼ 10−17Jycm2/ sr/H from the ISM.
To see what value of YSi the spinning nano silicate can
reproduce the AME, in Figure 5 we plot jν calculated
for YSi = 1, 5, 10, 20%, and selected β = 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1D.
Since nanoparticles are hotter than big grains, we take
Td = 60K as in previous works (HLD10; HLD11). The
observational data from various instruments extracted

SILLICATES AND POLARIZATION

5.1. Grain size distribution

Following Li & Draine (2001), we assume that ultra-
small silicate grains follow a log-normal size distribu-
tion:

nH

dn
da

=

B
a

exp −0.5(cid:20) log(a/a0)

σ

(cid:21)2! ,

(26)

where a0 and σ are the model parameters, and B is a
constant determined by YSi.

The peak of the mass distribution a3dn/d ln a occurs
at ap = a0e3σ2
. For diﬀerent models shown in Table 1 of
Li & Draine (2001) with a0 = 3 − 6˚A and σ = 0.3 − 0.6,
the upper limits for YSi for amorphous ultrasmall silicate
grains is Y max

Si = 20, 20, 20, 30% (Li & Draine 2001).

Figure 2 shows the size distribution for diﬀerent model
parameters with YSi = 1 − 20%, where we have added
the power law term AMRNa−3.5 (Mathis et al. 1977) with
AMRN = 10−25.11 cm−2.5 for silicate grains larger than
20nm, although the latter, slowly rotating grains, mostly
do not contribute to rotational emission.

5.2. Rotational Emissivity and Polarization

Using the angular momentum distribution obtained
from Langevin equation and dn/da from Equation (26),
we can compute rotational emissivity by spinning sili-
cate using Equation (12). We consider oblate spheroidal
grains with axial ratio r = 2 for a typical model. To ex-
plore the importance of spinning silicate, we consider a
model of the ISM with typical physical parameters char-
acterized by the CNM and adopt a typical magnetic ﬁeld
strength B = 10µG.

In addition to the rotational emissivity computed by
Equation (12), we are also interested in the polarized

the solid lines are the total spinning dust plus ther-

ν = j94 GHz(ν/94.)−1.7 with j94 GHz = 0.8MJy/sr.
It
can be seen that spinning nanosilicate with YSi < 10%
and β > 0.2D (Figure 5(b), (c), (d)) can successfully re-
produce the observed AME, in terms of both peak emis-
sivity and frequency. Nano silicate with larger value β
requires lower abundance YSi to reproduce the AME.

It is noted that both Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
Probe (WMAP) and Planck all-sky ﬁtting to the AME
requires two spinning dust components, one with a low
peak frequency and the other with a higher peak fre-

quency (Collaboration et al. 2015). In HLD11, it is suc-
cessfully reproduced by rotational emission from spin-
ning PAHs from the CNM and warn ionized medium
(see also Collaboration et al. 2015). In the light of this
study, two components may arise from spinning dust
in the same phase but with two separate populations,
namely spinning PAHs and spinning ultrasmall silicate.
In a future paper, we will explore the ﬁtting rotational
emission from spinning PAH and spinning silicate to the
AME obtained from Planck data to explain two spinning
dust components.

We have found that the polarization fraction of rota-
tional emission by ultrasmall silicate grains varies sig-
niﬁcantly with electric dipole moment β, and increases
with decreasing β. Thus, the AME polarization can be
used to constrain the value of β because the polarization
fraction is independent on YSi.

Figure 6 shows the polarization fraction for the diﬀer-
ent β overplotted with the AME polarization data ob-
served by various experiments. As shown, the predicted
polarization for spinning silicate with β < 0.2D exceeds
most of the observed data, whereas spinning silicate with
β ≥ 0.2D can adequately reproduce the level of the ob-
served AME polarization.
It is also cautious that the polarization of magnetic
dipole emission from free-ﬂying iron nanoparticles is
found to be within the AME polarization, therefore, the
constraint by the AME polarization is not so restrictive.

6.3. Constraints from the UV polarization of starlight

Interstellar polarization of starlight was discovered
more than 60 years ago (Hall 1949; Hiltner 1949). It now
becomes established that the interstellar polarization is
produced by aspherical grains aligned with the magnetic
ﬁeld (see Lazarian et al. 2015 for a review). For sub-
micron grains, the leading mechanism of grain alignment
is radiative torque alignment, which was ﬁrst introduced
by Dolginov & Mitrofanov (1976), numerically demon-
strated in Draine & Weingartner (1996), and analytically
modeled by Lazarian & Hoang (2007). For nanoparti-
cles, paramagnetic relaxation (Davis & Greenstein 1951;
Jones & Spitzer 1967; Roberge & Lazarian 1999) can in-
duce weak alignment (Hoang et al. 2014). It is quantiﬁed
in Hoang et al. (2014) that small grains dominate the UV
starlight polarization. Therefore, the presence of inter-
stellar silicate nanoparticles will obviously aﬀect the UV
polarization.

Fig. 7.— Polarization of starlight computed for diﬀerent values of
YSi and β. Symbols show the observed polarization curve described
by the Serkowski law with λmax = 0.55 µm. The cases with β ≥
0.4D and YSi < 10 do not violet the UV polarization of λ−1 ≥
6 µm−1.

To see for what values of YSi and β, the predicted
polarization by silicate nanoparticles do not violate the
observed UV polarization, we compute the polarization
curves of starlight for diﬀerent values of YSi and β.
To this end, we ﬁrst adopt the best-ﬁt model for the
ISM from Hoang et al. (2014) that reproduces the ”ob-
served” polarization curve described by the Serkowski
law (Serkowski et al. 1975) with λmax = 0.55 µm and ex-
tinction curve. Then, we introduce a population of sil-
icate nanoparticles with the size distribution (Eq. 26)
and the alignment degree computed in Section 4. The ﬁ-
nal polarization curve is then computed using Equation
(14) in Hoang et al. (2013) (see also Hoang et al. 2014).
The obtained results are shown in Figure 7, where the
symbols show the Serkowski law. The UV polarization
tends to increase with increasing YSi, as expected. The
case with β < 0.2D easily exceeds the UV polarization
for abundance YSi ≥ 5%, which can be ruled out. More-
over, the case of larger β ( β ≥ 0.4D) and YSi ≤ 10% have
small impact on the increase in the UV polarization.
Parameter space for spinning silicate that does not
violate current observational constraints is sketched in
Figure 8.
It is worth mentioning that the constraint
YSi < 10% is consistent with with the estimate based on
the UV extinction and mid-IR emission by Li & Draine
(2001).

Previous

(DL98;
Ali-Ha¨ımoud et al. 2009; Silsbee et al. 2011; HDL10;
HLD11) dealt with spinning PAHs, because it is a
well-established dust population in the ISM (see Tielens
2008). Since physics of spinning silicate (iron) is essen-
tially analogous to that of spinning PAHs, it is natural
to take our advanced spinning dust model for modeling
emission from spinning non-PAHs.

It is noted that the last model (HDL10; HLD11) treats
all known important physical eﬀects,
including grain
wobbling due to thermal ﬂuctuations within the grain,
transient spin-up by single-ion collisions. In particular,
the model can be applied to spinning dust grains of ar-
bitrary shape and arbitrary temperature (HLD11).

Fig. 8.— Schematic of allowable parameters β, YSi for silicate
nanoparticles for which its rotational emission and polarization
do not violate observational constraints (white area). The orange
shaded region represents the parameter space where the polariza-
tion violate the observed AME polarization, and the blue shaded
area depicts the space where rotational emission violates the AME,
and the polarization by nano silicate violates the UV polarization
of starlight for the ISM.

Finally, the spinning dust model (HDL10; HLD11)
is the unique model that can predict self-consistently
the polarization level of spinning dust emission (see also
Hoang et al. 2013, 2014); the spinning model from other
groups only provides rotational emissivity. It turns out
that our model can be used to constrain the dipole mo-
ment and magnetic properties of nanoparticles using the
AME polarization data.

7. SUMMARY

In summary, in this paper, we have obtained the prin-

cipal results as follows:

1 We have quantiﬁed rotational emission from spin-
ning ultrasmall silicate grains for diﬀerent grain
size distribution parameters, various fraction of to-
tal Si abundance contained in ultrasmall grains YSi,
and a wide range of the dipole moment per atoms
β.

2 The polarization fraction of spinning silicate emis-
sion is found to increase with decreasing the value
of β. The polarization fraction is below 5% for the
dipole moments β > 0.4D, but it can reach ∼ 20%
for β ∼ 0.1D.

3 We identiﬁed that the presence of silicate nanopar-
ticles with YSi ≤ 10% and the dipole moment
β ≥ 0.4D does not violate the UV polarization of
starlight and the observed polarization of AME.
With this realization (YSi ≤ 10%, β ≥ 0.4D), ro-
tational emission from spinning nano silicate can
adequately reproduce the AME from the ISM.

4 Our quantitative results suggest that rotational
emission from spinning silicate nanoparticles may
be an additional source of the AME. Future ob-
servations are needed to search for silicate emis-
sion features of nano silicate from the regions with
prominent AME.

There are several remaining questions on the problem
of spinning nano silicates, including the dipole moment

unlike PAHs that have been identiﬁed through mid-IR
emission features, the signature of silicate nanoparticles
is not yet clear. Further studies looking for signatures
of silicate nanoparticles are necessary for better under-
standing of the AME. Lastly, since this paper is intended
to explore the importance of rotational emission from
spinning silicate, we have presented calculations only for
a standard model of the ISM with typical physical pa-
rameters characterized by the CNM. More calculations
for the diﬀerent phases of the ISM and ﬁtting to obser-
vational data will be presented in our future paper.

where ˆρ = ρ/3 g cm−3, and ˆTgas = Tgas/100 K.

The characteristic damping times of an oblate spheroidal grain for rotation along the directions parallel and perpen-

dicular to the grain symmetry axis ˆa1 are respectively given by (Lazarian 1997)

where τH,k ≡ τH,z, τH,⊥ ≡ τH,y = τH,x with z the grain symmetry axis, and x and y being the axes perpendicular to
the symmetry axis. In the above equation, nH is the gas density, mH is the hydrogen mass, vth = (2kBTgas/mH)1/2 is
the thermal speed of hydrogen. Above, Γk and Γ⊥ are geometrical factors, which are given by (Roberge et al. 1993):

The limiting values are Γk = Γ⊥ = 1 for e = 0 (i.e., spherical grains), and Γk = Γ⊥ = 3/8 for e = 1.

where µk and µ⊥ are the components of the dipole moment µ parallel and perpendicular to the grain symmetry axis.

B. MAGNETIC ALIGNMENT OF THERMALLY ROTATING GRAINS

Since we are interested also in polarization of spinning dust emission, it is worth to brieﬂy summarize the magnetic

property of silicate material and magnetic alignment.

Silicate material is an ordinary paramagnetic material. The zero-frequency susceptibility is given by

χ(0) = 0.042fp(cid:18) 15K
Td (cid:19) ,

(B1)

where Td is the grain temperature and fp is the fraction of paramagnetic atoms (i.e., atoms with partially ﬁlled shells)
in the grain (see Draine 1996 and references therein). For presented calculations, a typical value fp = 0.1 is assumed
for the ordinary paramagnetic material of silicate.

The frequency-dependence imaginary part of susceptibility χ2(ω) is given by the critically-damped solution:

χ2(ω) =

χ(0)ωτ

[1 + (ωτ /2)2]2 ,

(B2)

where τ = τ2 ∼ 2.9 × 10−12/fp s is the spin-spin relaxation time (see Hoang et al. 2014).
Davis & Greenstein (1951) (henceforth DG51) suggested that a paramagnetic grain rotating with angular velocity
ω in an external magnetic ﬁeld experiences paramagnetic relaxation, which dissipates the grain rotational energy into
heat. This results in the gradual alignment of ω and J with the magnetic ﬁeld at which the rotational energy is
minimum.

The characteristic timescale for the magnetic alignment of J with B is given by

τm =

Ik

K(ω)V B2 =

2ρa2s−2/3
5K(ω)B2 ,

(B3)

where K(ω) = χ2(ω)/ω, and Ik from Equation (1) has been used.

11

To describe the eﬀect of grain alignment by magnetic relaxation against the randomization by gas atoms, a dimen-

sionless parameter δm is usually used:

δm =

τH,k
τm ≃ 0.28

−5s4/3 ˆB2(K(ω)/10−13 s−1)
a−1

ˆngas ˆTgasΓk

,

(B4)

where τH,k is the gaseous damping for the rotation around the grain symmetry axis, ˆngas = nH/30 cm−3, ˆTgas =
Tgas/100 K, ˆB = B/10µG, and Γk < 1 is a geometrical factor (see Appendix A).

The ﬂuctuation terms associated with the magnetic dissipation are

Bm,xx = Bm,yy =

and Bm,zz = 0.
