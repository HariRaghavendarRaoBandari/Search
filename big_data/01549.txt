(Dated: March 7, 2016)

Evaluation of the angular distribution function of particles scattered in an amorphous medium is
improved by deforming the integration path in the Fourier integral representation into the complex
plane. That allows us to present the distribution function as a sum of two positive components, soft
and hard, the soft component being close to a Gaussian, and the hard component vanishing in the
forward direction, while including the Rutherford asymptotics and all the power corrections to it at
large scattering angles. Detailed properties of those components, and their interplay at intermediate
deﬂection angles are discussed. Comparison with the Moli`ere theory is given.

INTRODUCTION

At passage of ultrarelativistic

charged particles
through amorphous matter, they undergo multiple, es-
sentially uncorrelated scattering on atoms, typically
through small angles. If the target is not too thick, the
longitudinal momentum of a high-energy particle may
be regarded as conserved. Then, the transport equa-
tion depends only on the particle deﬂection angles, and
is exactly solvable by means of Fourier transformation
[1]. However, conditions of multiple Coulomb scattering
on screened atomic nuclei may require one to separately
treat hard and soft contributions to the distribution func-
tion, as was ﬁrst pointed out by Williams [2]. That sepa-
ration was cast in the form of a large-thickness expansion
by Moli`ere [3, 4], subsequently reviewed by Bethe [5],
and nowadays is recognized as a standard procedure (see
[6–8]). In modern practice, yet a simpliﬁed approach is
applied at times, retaining only the Gaussian component
with the root mean square angle inferred from Gaussian
ﬁts [10], or derived analytically from the Mol`ere theory
[11]. But in high-statistics experiments, non-Gaussian
“wings” are noticeable even for rather thick targets.

Although Moli`ere’s expansion provides a formal back-
ground for the theory, from the physical point of view
it is not completely satisfactory.
It is known that, in
principle, it does not converge (see, e.g., [12]), and yet,
is comprised of oscillatory functions of deﬂection angles,
which do not admit independent probabilistic interpreta-
tion. At the same time, there were recent phenomenolog-
ical indications that beyond the central Gaussian region,
the distribution function does not immediately switch to
the asymptotic power law corresponding to single scatter-
ing, but exhibits some transient behavior over a sizable
range of angles [13, 14].

In case such a transition region does exist, the best
option to compute within it the distribution function
would be to resum all the non-Gaussian (at least, power-
law) contributions through all orders, as is done in other

physical problems (see, e.g., [9]). That typically leads to
integral representations for resummed quantities. But in
the present case, one can employ to this end a method
[5, 6], in which the original Fourier integral representation
for the distribution function is extended into the complex
plane, and two principally diﬀerent (vertical and horizon-
tal) parts of the integration path are distinguished. That
method so far has never developed to a procedure supe-
rior to Moli`ere’s expansion; nonetheless, with some im-
provements, it can be raised to that status, and provide
a diﬀerent view on behavior of the angular distribution
beyond the central region. The key notion here is that
integrals over the mentioned parts of the path appear
to be positive, and therefore may be interpreted as hard
and soft scattering components, coexisting at any scat-
tering angle. Comparison of those components will allow
us to determine the width of the transition region be-
tween Gaussian and Rutherford regions in the aggregate
distribution, and assess the signiﬁcance of resummation
of all the plural hard-scattering contributions.

II. PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS

A. Fourier-Bessel solution of the transport

equation

The probability distribution of

fast particles scat-
tered through small angles θ in an amorphous medium,
f (θ, l) = dw

d2θ , is governed by the transport equation

∂f
∂l

= nZ dσ(χ) [f (θ − χ, l) − f (θ, l)] ,

(1)

where dσ(χ) = d2χ dσ
d2χ is the diﬀerential cross-section of
particle scattering on one atom through angle χ, n is the
density of atoms in the medium, and l the traversed tar-
get thickness. Equation (1) conserves the normalization:

Z d2θf (θ, l) = 1,

(2)

Solution of Eq. (1) satisfying the initial condition
f (θ, 0) = δ(θ) is obtained by means of Fourier-Bessel

transformation:

f (θ, l) = Z

We shall denote distribution functions (3) and (4) by the
same letter f , distinguishing them just by notation of
their angle arguments.

B. Thick targets: Moli`ere’s theory

At signiﬁcant target thickness, the random walk in
the plane of deﬂection angles (which may be viewed as
transverse vectors) must reduce to diﬀusion. In generic
integral representations (3) and (4), that comes about
as follows: at large nl, the exponential in their inte-
grands is rapidly decreasing, therefore the contributing
ρ or ξ are small, permitting one to expand the exponent
to leading order in their values. However, naive expan-
sion 1 − J0(ρχ) ≃ ρ2χ2/4 in the integrand gives a loga-
rithmically diverging variance R dσ(χ)χ2, given that the
physical diﬀerential cross-section of fast charged particle
scattering on one atom through large angles obeys the
Rutherford asymptotics

with p being the particle momentum, Z the nucleus

curate calculation [5] shows that the small-ρ asymptotics
of the exponent in (3), (4) involves a factor logarithmi-
cally depending on ρ:

and thereby spoiling the Gaussianity of the Fourier-

c(l) = 4πnlZ 2α2/p2, and the
screening angle χ′
a ∼ 1/Rap, with Ra being the atomic
radius, characterizes the scale of angles at which the sin-
gularity in (5) is tamed.1 Thus, the diﬀusion here is

plies that the distribution function does not approach a

ther.

well [see, e.g., [11], Eq. (42)]. For instance, ratio χc/χ′
a =
102 corresponds to targets of solid materials of a few
millimeter thickness.
In what follows, we will measure
the target thickness in Z-independent fashion, merely in
units of χ2

c /χ′2
a .

Approximation (6) appreciably simpliﬁes the structure
of integrals (3), (4), but their evaluation still involves
non-trivial aspects. Intuitively, it is clear that the diﬀu-
sion, at least at typical angles, must be close to Gaussian,
although with possible logarithmic deviations. To tackle
those, Moli`ere [4] assumed that the typical deﬂection an-
gle is χc√B, with B such that the diﬀerence of logarith-
mically large parameters B− ln B− ln χ2
is a constant of
the order of unity (conventionally set to be zero). There-
with, B(χ2
a ) is a Lambert (or product logarithm)
function, asymptotically equal B ≃χc≫χ′
and the rhs of (6) rewrites as

where γE is the Euler’s constant. This deﬁnition [5] diﬀers from
the more conventional χa [4] by terms γE − 1/2 = 0.077, but nu-
merically, the diﬀerence is small. With deﬁnition (7), the right-
hand side (rhs) of Eq. (6) is the shortest, facilitating the following
calculations. Note, too, that while Eq. (6) was written for pure
elastic scattering, inelastic contributions can also be incorporated
there [17], just by redeﬁning χ′

a and χc.

Note that the expansion parameter B−1 here is only log-
arithmically small, but for B ≥ 4.5, i.e., χc ≫ 10χ′
a,
expansion (8) is reported to work reasonably well [4, 5].
An important consequence of (9) is that for all k ≥ 1,

Z d2θf (k)(θ) ≡ 0.

Analyzing integrals (9), one ﬁnds that at large Θ, com-
ponents of (8) behave as f (0)(Θ) = 2e−Θ2
, which cor-
responds to a perfect Gaussian, and f (1)(Θ) ∼ Θ−4,
which reﬂects the Rutherford asymptotics f (θ) ≃ nl
dσ
dθ .
For k ≥ 2, f (k)(Θ) ∼ Θ−2−2k times logarithmic fac-
tors (which will be determined below). Further analy-
sis reveals that, in fact, functions f (k) for k ≥ 1 make
several oscillations,2 which are much stronger than the
asymptotic power-law “tails”. At moderate χc/χ′
a, they
may cause a spurious warp in between the Gaussian and
Rutherford regions. Yet, despite the factor k! in the de-
nominator in the rhs of (9), functions f (k) grow with k
faster than exponentially [see Eq. (11)]. Therefore, in
principle, series (8) diverges, though it may still serve as
an asymptotic expansion in the limit nl → ∞.

but it is exactly canceled by the second term of (14).
Therefore, to determine the asymptotics of f2, one has
to expand the slowly varying factors in the integrand to

Even though at typical angles the number of scatter-

overshoots the latter constant at some intermediate θx.
That salient feature of the multiple Coulomb scattering
angular distribution was conﬁrmed experimentally (see
[5, 15]).

Similarly, it can be proven that higher-order terms in

Note that the coeﬃcients at logarithms in Eqs. (17),
(21) turn out to be sizable already at k = 1, and grow
with k factorially. Thus, at moderately large θ, it would
be advantageous to sum such contributions through all
orders. Resummations of that kind are usually carried
out via Borel transformation [16]. But in our case, con-
struction of a new integral representation is unnecessary,
as long as the original integral representation (3) or (4)
is already well suited for that purpose. Below we will de-
rive corresponding resumming expressions directly from
integrals (3) and (4).

III. ANALYSIS IN THE COMPLEX PLANE

Since we are interested in the case when the number of
collisions is high, the exponent in integrals (3), (4) will
generally assume large values. The modern approach to
deriving asymptotics of such integrals consists in extend-
ing the integral into a complex plane. With an appro-
priate choice of the integration path, the integrand can
be made non-oscillatory, which substantially alleviates
derivation of the asymptotics of the integral. In applica-
tion to multiple Coulomb scattering distributions, such a
deformation procedure was ﬁrst suggested by Bethe (see
Appendix A in [5], and also [6]), but served mainly for the
purpose of deriving the coeﬃcients of large-angle power
asymptotic terms [6], or combining just a few such terms
to an expression, which still worked only in a limited do-
main of θ (at large θ) [5]. Here we are going to handle the
entire sequence of asymptotic terms simultaneously, but
in order to make it applicable everywhere, the deﬁnition
of the integration path must be improved. The path ex-
tension problem appears to be technically simpler for the
projected angle distribution, which was not considered in
[5] at all, and which we consider here ﬁrst.

As long as Eq. (23) is transcendental, only its approxi-
mate solution can be expressed explicitly, which, though,
will suit us at the present stage. We can choose an
approximation to the solution of (23), which is strictly

tice). To illustrate the accuracy of approximation (24),

that approximation (24) begins to fail for χc/χ′
a ∼ 10.
The logarithmic factor in the exponent in (22) induces
a singularity of the integrand at the origin, coinciding
with the lower endpoint of the integration interval. The
steepest descent path must then start at the origin, and
go toward the saddle point. For simplicity of the resulting
integral, though, we direct it strictly along the imaginary
axis, rewriting the integration variable as κ = iν. After
reaching a point κ0 deﬁned by Eq. (25), the path must
turn to the right and proceed along the steepest descent
path, but again, for simplicity, we just direct it parallel
to the real axis (see Fig. 2). Ultimately, the distribution
function splits to a sum of two real-variable integrals:

f (θx, l) = fh(θx, l) + fs(θx, l),

itive everywhere, even for an approximate solution of the

thermore, almost everywhere it is tolerable to replace in
(27) sin πν 2

of either large or small θx/χc: If θx/χc ≪ 1, that be-

The fact that the component fh(θx) vanishes in both
extremes θx/χc → 0 and θx/χc → ∞ implies that it
must peak somewhere in between [see Fig. 3]. From the
analysis of integral (27), one generally concludes that the
summit of fh(θx) must be reached when ν0 ∼ χc/θx,
i.e., θx ∼ χcpB(χ2
a ), which is nothing but Moli`ere’s
typical angle. More precisely, that corresponds to the
rising slope of the peak, while the maximum is located at
a somewhat greater θx (see Fig. 3). The end of the region
where resummation eﬀects are strong may be assessed
from equating the Rutherford asymptotic term to the
doubled next-to-leading-order power correction in (30):

Besides that, it is noteworthy that fh(θx) does not lie
between its asymptotes (in particular, it goes well above
the Rutherford asymptote). This (or rather the corre-
sponding feature for fh(θ) proven in the next subsection)
may be responsible for the empirical controversies men-
tioned in the Introduction.

asymptotics (13).

b. Soft component Next, we inspect the soft compo-
nent, which is deﬁned by integral (28). This integral is
close to Gaussian form, so its fastest dependence on θx
stems from the value of the exponential at the endpoint:

where we used the saddle point equation (23) within the

might be to replace in the relation

tainly worth taking into account also the slope of g(θx, l)
in the origin. That can be implemented to the structure

f (0)(θ/χc√B) of Moli`ere’s
expansion (applied to
the projected angle distribution), but has a more precise
normalization (32), and yet involves θx under the
logarithm in the denominator of the exponent. Due to
the latter dependence, (34) is narrower than Moli`ere’s
f (0) at θx > χc, i.e., in fact, at typical angles (see Fig. 4).
A narrowing of that kind was empirically found in [15].
Besides that, the integral of (34) over θx, in contrast
to the integral of the zeroth component of Moli`ere’s
expansion, is somewhat less than unity, leaving a part of
the probability for fh.

c. Aggregate distribution The circumstance that
components (27), (28) in decomposition (26) peak at
diﬀerent θx might potentially lead to appearance of a
secondary bump in the aggregate distribution. To check
whether this happens in reality, let us ﬁrst assess the scale
at which fs(θx) and fh(θx) become commensurable. For
large χc/χ′
a, that occurs at relatively large θx, allowing
one, oversimplistically, to employ the Rutherford asymp-
totics for fh, and equate it to the Gaussian approxima-
tion for fs. Solving the equation in the leading logarith-
mic approximation yields θx ∼ χcq2 ln 2χc
, which is of
the order of the scale χc√B at which fh(θx) reaches its
maximum. Therefore, around its maximum, fh(θx) is
commensurable with fs(θx), and consequently, the sum
(26) needs not develop a secondary peak or bump. That
is what actually happens in practice, and is physically
natural, because a diﬀusion process tends to smear out
all the features of the probability distribution. (But for
the rescaled distribution θ3
xf (θx), as was mentioned in
Sec. II C, such a bump does exist [5, 15].)

sum of soft and pure Rutherford components (dot-dashed
and dotted curves, correspondingly). To account for this
excess, one has to employ the resummed hard component
(dashed curve) instead of a single-scattering contribution.
So, the issue of resummation of plural hard scattering
contributions is quite essential in practice. Eﬀectively, it
slows down the transition from a Gaussian to Rutherford
regime, so that over a substantial angular interval it may
mimic a law intermediate between Gaussian and Ruther-
ford decrease, such as a simple exponential law (cf. [13]),
or a power law with an index greater than that for the
lowest Born approximation, as is the case, e.g., for hard
scattering of hadrons (which are themselves composite
objects) [14].

d. Probabilistic interpretation Granted the positiv-
in conjunc-
−∞ dθxfs +
−∞ dθxfh = 1,
it is tempting further to interpret
them independently as partial probability distributions.
Speciﬁcally, since fh(θx) incorporates all the power-law
contributions, it might be regarded as the probability dis-
tribution of hard-scattered particles, and fs(θx), since it
is nearly Gaussian, should be interpreted as the proba-
bility distribution of soft-scattered particles. That, in-
evitably, involves an element of arbitrariness, as long as
there is no sharp physical boundary between soft- and
hard-scattered particles. Besides that, there are regions
at suﬃciently large θx, where fs(θx) as evaluated by
Eq. (28) becomes slightly negative [though that is imma-
terial for practice, because there it is already overtaken
by fh(θx)]. For those reasons, it is more appropriate to
term the encountered functions pseudo-probability dis-
tributions. The mentioned arbitrariness then manifests
itself as the residual slight freedom in the choice of the
location of the integration path corner.

Accepting the partial (pseudo-)probability interpreta-
tion, let us assess the corresponding total probability for

That means that essentially, wh-x ≃ 1/B. Formula (36b)
shows that the fraction of hard-scattered particles de-
creases with the increase of the target thickness, as an
inverse of its logarithm. The physical reason for this
is that the boundary beginning from which the particles
must be regarded as hard-scattered moves outwards with
the increase of the target thickness, due to the expand-
ing Gaussian component.
In contrast, identity (10) in
the Moli`ere expansion does not grant direct access to the
number of particles in the non-Gaussian component.

ted in Fig. 6 by the solid curve, along with approximation

eﬀectively replacing ν under the logarithm by χc/θ rather than
θ/χc, as is suggested by Eq. (40). That still works when dealing
with large-angle asymptotics of the angular distribution, but not
when one aims to ﬁnd a uniform approximation for all deﬂection
angles. In the latter case, the saddle point must be sought for
the entire integrand, and the path corner point be chosen as near
as possible to it, as is done in the present paper. Moreover, even
Eq. (40) may be not the perfect approximation for the entire
range of θ (as we will see below), so, generally, it seems best to
solve the corner point equation numerically.

Again, we interpret them as partial pseudoprobability
distributions for a particle to belong to hard or to soft
scattering probability. Let us now analyze the behavior
of those components, and compare them with the corre-
sponding projected angle distributions.

First of all, similarly to the previous subsection, func-
tion fh(θ, l) proves to be everywhere positive, because
typical ν for any θ are less than unity, and then the sine
in the integrand is positive, so we eﬀectively have an in-
tegral of a positive deﬁnite function. Using the unlimited
growth of ν0 with θ, it is straightforward to derive the
Rutherford asymptotics for integral (44), along with its
next-to-leading order power correction:

The coeﬃcient of the correction term here is in agreement
with the leading log calculation (20).
In the opposite
limit θ/χc → 0, using (42), function fh(θ) can be shown

but tends to zero, anyway. Hence, it must reach a max-
imum at some ﬁnite, nonzero θ. Figure 8 plots function
(44) with ν0 evaluated numerically from Eq. (39).

In contrast to the case of projected angle distribution,
it appears now that the use of Eq. (40) does not give a
good approximation for fh(θ) simultaneously for all typ-
ical θ – because (40) is a much poorer approximation
for solution of Eq. (39) itself. That is demonstrated by
Fig. 8, where the red curve corresponding to approxima-
tion (40) falls much below the calculation with the exact
solution of Eq. (39). It signals that for the polar angle
distribution, it is much more reliable to solve the corner
point equation numerically.

Similarly to the previous subsection, we can ﬁnd that
the support region for function fh(θ) is concentrated at

where B2 = 8B(8e2γE−3χ2

tions. Numerically, of course, that presents no diﬃ-
culty, and is illustrated in Fig. 9. Qualitatively, func-

wh-x(χc/χ′

so that it cannot be even regarded as small. A satis-

IV. SUMMARY

The main conclusions of our paper can be summarized
as follows. A continuation into the complex plane al-
lows presenting the angular distribution of probability
of particles scattered in amorphous matter as a sum of
hard- and soft-scattering components, with no restriction
on the number of scatterings. At that, the hard com-
ponent incorporates all the plural-scattering power-law
corrections to the Rutherford single-scattering contribu-
tion, while the soft component is nearly Gaussian, but is
narrower than Moli`ere’s f (0). Due to their positivity al-
most everywhere, those components admit independent
(pseudo)probabilistic interpretation. The corresponding
total percentage of hard-scattered particles (not appear-
ing naturally in the Moli`ere theory) amounts typically
wh-x ∼ 10% for the projected angle distribution, and
wh ∼ 25% in case of the polar angle distribution), and
sets the accuracy limit for Gauss-like approximations for
the soft component.

The second conclusion is that in the aggregate distribu-
tion of scattered particles, there is a signiﬁcant transition
region between multiple soft and single hard scattering,
in which scattering is multiple but hard. Physically, it
is chained to the fact that at signiﬁcant target thickness,
there always exists a range of angles, where the probabil-
ity of several hard rescatterings is non-negligible. The re-
summed hard-scattering component peaks at a non-zero
deﬂection angle, and around its maximum (in the so-
called semihard region), it exceeds the single hard scat-
tering (Rutherford) contribution by a signiﬁcant factor.
Nonetheless, no bump emerges in the aggregate distri-
bution around this angle, inasmuch as in the semihard
region, the hard component is comparable with the soft
one.

From the practical point of view, it must be noted that
if it is desired to use a single approximation within the
central region of scattering angles only, it may be rea-
sonable to employ Moli`ere’s f (0); but if the hard “tail”
needs description, as well, it is advantageous to use the

separation fh + fs introduced herein. Even after approx-
imating fs by a quasi-Gaussian, the sum fh + fs is still
numerically more accurate than a few ﬁrst terms of the
Moli`ere expansion.

Besides that, it should be remembered that the sepa-
ration of fh and fs somewhat depends on the choice of
the corner point for the integration path (which does not
coincide with the saddle point of the integrand exactly),
and thus may involve slight ambiguity. Analytic solutions

of the corner point equation provide insight into qualita-
tive dependencies of the particle distribution function on
the total deﬂection angle and the target thickness, but
may sometimes be insuﬃciently accurate, so, if better
precision is required, the saddle point equation is to be
solved numerically. Thus, depending on the needs of the
study, the proposed construction may be used either for
analytic, or for numerical purposes.
