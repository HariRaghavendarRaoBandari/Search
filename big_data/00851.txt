Introduction

Various four dimensional superconformal ﬁeld theories have been extensively studied for
decades, except one with just twelve supercharges. This is because the N = 3 vector mul-
tiplet is the only free multiplet of N = 3 supersymmetry. It has the same ﬁeld contents
as those of the N = 4 vector multiplet, and thus an N = 3 theory is necessarily enhanced
to the N = 4 one in the absence of strong interaction. From the viewpoint of AdS/CFT
correspondence [1], such non-trivial N = 3 superconformal ﬁeld theory has been expected
to exist from analysis of type IIB supergravity solution [2]. They have shown that there
exists AdS5 solution with such superconformal symmetry by appropriate truncation from
maximally supersymmetric solution, and also implied that some non-perturbative sym-
metry is mandatory to realize genuine N = 3 theory. (See [3] for recent study of such
supergravity solution.)
A detailed realization of such pure N = 3 theories has recently been done in [4]. They
started with the D3-brane realization of the N = 4 U(N) supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory (SYM), and reduced its supersymmetry by a simple orbifold projection at special
points of the marginal coupling τ . For a generic value of τ a Z2 subgroup of SL(2, Z)
Montonen-Olive duality of the N = 4 theory is a non-perturbative symmetry, and it leads
to usual orientifold. However, at some special values, the symmetry is enhanced and we can
deﬁne new orbifold, which we refer to as Zk orientifold with k = 3, 4, 6. In the F-theoretic
description, the Zk symmetry can be interpreted as the rotation of the internal torus.

A general analysis of genuine N = 3 theories that does not rely on explicit construction
of the theory was performed in [5] by using N = 3 superconformal symmetry and its
representations. They proved that a genuine N = 3 theory does not have exactly marginal
deformations. This is consistent with the fact that they can be deﬁned only at special values
of τ . This was also conﬁrmed in [6], in which a comprehensive analysis of supersymmetric
deformations in superconformal theories was given. Another important property is that
the dimension of Coulomb branch operators must be integer greater than 2. This was
conﬁrmed in rank-1 N = 3 theories in [7, 8].
A purpose of this paper is to analyze the Zk orientifold theories deﬁned in [4] from their
holographic dual. Namely, type IIB theory in AdS5 × S5/Zk with k = 3, 4, 6. We ﬁrst
derive the superconformal index of such orientifold theories in the large N limit by means
of Kaluza-Klein analysis. Fortunately, the SL(2, Z) symmetry is realized as a classical
symmetry in type IIB supergravity, which facilitates speciﬁcation of the orientifold. Since
the Kaluza-Kline modes in AdS5 × S5 was already studied in [9], it is straightforward
to calculate the index of those on the orientifold by a simple projection. We check that
the index determined by the truncation precisely reproduces that of the corresponding
gauge theory when k = 2, in which case the gauge theory is known as N = 4 SYM with
orthogonal or symplectic gauge group [10], and its large N index is computable.
In the perturbative
cases with k = 1 and 2 the leading correction to the superconformal index in the ﬁnite N
theory comes from wrapped D3-branes. If they wrap topologically trivial cycles they are
called (dual-)giant gravitons, and give negative contribution to the index. If the cycle is

topologically non-trivial they contribute positively to the index. We assume this relation
persists in other cases and determine which type of wrapped branes gives the leading
correction to the index by analyzing discrete torsion and three-cycle homologies.

Note added

After completion of this work, we have noticed a paper by Aharony and Tachikawa [11],
which also analyze N = 3 theories from a holographic point of view and has some overlap
with this work.

2 Zk orientifolds

The orientifold construction of N = 3 theories in [4] starts from the type IIB realization
of the N = 4 supersymmetric U(N) Yang-Mills theory. We realize it as the theory on
It possesses the
a stack of N D3-branes placed in the ﬂat ten-dimensional space-time.
superconformal symmetry P SU(2, 2|4), whose bosonic subgroup is

SU(2, 2) × SU(4)R ⊂ P SU(2, 2|4).

(2.1)

The R-symmetry, SU(4)R, is the rotation of R6 transverse to the D3-branes. The four
left handed supercharges QI (I = 1, 2, 3, 4) belong to the fundamental representation. We
present SU(4)R irreducible representations by using integral Dynkin labels (r1, r2, r3). The
labels ra are eigenvalues of Cartan generators Ra, whose action on QI are

R1 = (1,−1, 0, 0), R2 = (0, 1,−1, 0), R3 = (0, 0, 1,−1).

(2.2)

The labels of the fundamental and the anti-fundamental representations are (1, 0, 0) and
(0, 0, 1), respectively. Unlike the N ≤ 3 case the R-symmetry group is not U(N )R but
SU(4)R.
For the conformal group, we use the Cartan generators of the compact subgroup U(1)×
SU(2)1 × SU(2)2 ⊂ SU(2, 2): the conformal energy E, the SU(2)1 Cartan J1, and the
SU(2)2 Cartan J2.
Let us consider an abelian orientifold group generated by g that acts on the supercharges

as

g : (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) → (eiθ1Q1, eiθ2Q2, eiθ3Q3, eiθ4Q4).

(2.3)

To preserve three supercharges QI (I = 1, 2, 3), we need to set θ1 = θ2 = θ3 = 0. When
g is an element of SU(4)R it is impossible to obtain a genuine N = 3 theory because the
speciality of the R-symmetry group requires the fourth angle θ4 to be also zero, and then
the whole N = 4 supersymmetry is preserved. To realize genuine N = 3 supersymmetry,
we need to combine SU(4)R with the duality symmetry, which rotates all QI by the same
angle.

The SL(2, R) symmetry of type IIB supergravity can be linearly realized by introducing
auxiliary scalar ﬁelds [12, 13]. In the formalism the theory has SL(2, R) global and U(1)
local symmetries, and the scalar ﬁelds V +
(a = 1, 2) are transformed as 2+1 under the
a
symmetry. The moduli space SL(2, R)/U(1) is parameterized by the axio-dilaton τ =
χ + ie−φ = V +

form SL(2, R) doublets. Two charges are combined into the complex charge

a qa.

(2.5)

(2.6)

The quantized values of qC form the charge lattice with the modulus τ on the complex
plane. The associated torus is the internal torus of the F-theory description of type IIB
theory. Because the U(1)Y symmetry rotates the lattice the symmetry is broken to a
discrete subgroup Γ ⊂ U(1). For a generic value of τ this is Γ = Z2, while at special values
of τ larger symmetry is realized; Γ = Zk with k = 3, 4, 6 for τ = e2πi/k up to SL(2, Z). The
orientifold construction of genuine N = 3 theories works only for these special values of τ .
To describe U(1)Y transformation, it is convenient to combine two three-form ﬁelds
into a complex ﬁeld H C
3 . We also express the spin 3/2 and spin
1/2 fermion ﬁelds as complex ﬁelds ψC
µ and λC, respectively. If we normalize Y so that
Y (V +

a ) = +1 the complex ﬁelds carry the following charges:

Y (δτ ) = +2,

(2.7)

where δτ denotes the ﬂuctuation around the expectation value of τ . The non-trivial U(1)Y
charge of the gravitino implies that the supercharge is also rotated by U(1)Y .
In the
context of the boundary N = 4 theory all the four supercharges QI (I = 1, 2, 3, 4) carries
Y = +1/2.
Let zi (i = 1, 2, 3) be complex coordinates of the transverse space R6 = C3. We consider

the abelian orbifold group that is generated by the combination of the spacial rotation

(z1, z2, z3) → (eiϕ1z1, eiϕ2z2, eiϕ3z3)

(2.8)

and the U(1)Y rotation eiϕ4Y . This acts on the supercharges as the rotation (2.3) with the

(−ϕ1 + ϕ2 − ϕ3 + ϕ4),
(−ϕ1 − ϕ2 + ϕ3 + ϕ4),
(ϕ1 + ϕ2 + ϕ3 + ϕ4).

(2.9)

We set the same value to ϕi

and denote the corresponding rotation by g = eiϕA, where the generator A acts on QI as

ϕ1 = ϕ2 = ϕ3 = ϕ4 = ϕ

(2.10)

A = (0, 0, 0, +2).

(2.11)

As we mentioned the U(1)Y symmetry is broken to its discrete subgroup, and only

restricted values of ϕ is allowed:

ϕ =

2π
k

k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6.

The fourth supercharge Q4 is rotated by g as
Q4 → e

4πi

k Q4,

(2.12)

(2.13)

which is trivial when k = 2 and non-trivial for k = 3, 4, 6. Accordingly while the orbifold
projection for the former value of k gives another N = 4 theory, that for the latter values
gives a genuine N = 3 one.
It is natural to ask what kind of gauge theory is realized on the D3-branes sitting at
the orientifold singularity of these geometries. Although this question is rather diﬃcult to
answer for N = 3 theories due to the fact that the theory is deﬁned in a non-perturbative
fashion (see [5] for recent analysis), it is easy for k = 2, in which case the projection
is nothing but the ordinary orientifold associated with the reversal of string orientation.
Leaving string modes invariant under the orientifold action leads to orthogonal gauge group
or symplectic one depending on the intrinsic parity of open strings. When the number of
D3-branes before the projection is even the gauge group is SO(2N) or Sp(N), while if it
is odd SO(2N + 1) gauge theory is realized.

Before ending this section, let us explicitly deﬁne the superconformal index, which will
be analyzed in the following sections. To deﬁne the index, we should choose one of the
supercharges. We use the one with the following quantum numbers.

E(Q) =

1

,

J1(Q) = −1,

J2(Q) = 0,

R1(Q) = 1, R2(Q) = R3(Q) = 0.

(2.14)

The choice of the supercharge breaks SU(4)R symmetry into SU(3) × U(1). Furthermore,
the orientifold projection with g ≥ 3 further breaks the SU(3) into SU(2) × U(1). Thus it
is convenient to deﬁne the following additional SU(4)R Cartan generators.

X = 3R1 + 2R2 + R1 = (+3,−1,−1,−1),
T8 = R2 + 2R2 = (0, +1, +1,−2).

X appears in the algebra

∆ := {Q, Q†} = E − J1 −

X,

(2.15)

(2.16)

and the SU(3) × U(1) subgroup respected by the index is speciﬁed as the commuting
subalgebra of X. We can use T8 together with R2 as Cartan generators of SU(3), and we
deﬁne the N = 4 superconformal index [14] by

I(t, y, p, q) = tr(cid:2)(−1)F e−β∆t2E+J1yJ2pR2qT8(cid:3) .

(2.17)

3 Large N limit

A Zk orientifold theory is speciﬁed by k, the order of the orientifold group, and N, the size of
the gauge group. Precisely speaking, the latter does not make sense for k = 3, 4, 6 because
of the absence of perturbative description. Even so we can deﬁne N as the dimension of
the Coulomb branch divided by 6. This is often referred to as the rank of the theory. From
the viewpoint of the brane system the rank is the number of mobile D3-branes. In this
section we analyze the superconformal index in the large N limit by using the AdS/CFT
correspondence.

The Kaluza-Klein spectrum of type IIB supergravity in AdS5 × S5 was determined in

[9]. They belong to the reducible representation

irreducible representation is decomposed into 36 irreducible representations of the bosonic
subgroup SU(2, 2) × SU(4) for generic n, which are listed in the table in [9].

We denote the SU(2, 2) × SU(4)4 × U(1)Y irreducible representations by C[j1; j2](r1,r2,r3)
.
Only nine of them in the decomposition saturating the BPS bound ∆ ≥ 0 are shown
explicitly in (3.2), and · · · denotes the other terms that do not contribute to the index.
By using this decomposition it is easy to calculate the superconformal index. Let Sn be
the contribution of an N = 4 superconformal multiplet S[0; 0](0,n,0)
Sn(t, y, p, q) =X(−1)F t2E+j1χj2(y)χ(r2,r3)(p, q)

An explicit expression is obtained by setting z = 1 and q′ = q in (3.10) below.

In the large N limit, the index of the N = 3 theory is obtained by simple Zk projection
that eliminate Zk non-invariant modes. For this purpose it is convenient to extend the
index by introducing the fugacity for U(1)Y . To preserve Q used for the deﬁnition of the
index (2.17), we combine Y and X, and insert the factor zY − X
6 . In addition, we rewrite
the fugacity q by q = q′z−2/3. Then, by using the relation

we can rewrite the factor qT8zY −

I KK(t, y, p, q′, z) = tr(cid:2)(−1)F t2E+J1yJ2pR2q′T8zA(cid:3) .

(3.7)

The U(1)Y charge of each Kaluza-Klein mode is also given in [9], and are shown in the
decomposition (3.2). It is straightforward to repeat the calculation with the extra fugacity.
The contribution of each superconformal multiplet is

Sn(t, y, p, q′, z) =X(−1)F t2E+j1χj2(y)χ(r2,r3)(p, q′z−2/3)zY −x/6

where the summation is again taken over the nine components explicitly shown in (3.2).
Although fractional powers of z appear in the expression (3.8) we can easily check that
powers of z are actually always n mod 2. Namely, Sn satisﬁes

Sn(t, y, p, q′,−z) = (−1)nSn(t, y, p, q′, z).
By summing up all the contributions for n = 1, 2, . . . we obtain

due to the relation (3.9). The projection does not divide Sn into two or more parts. This
fact is consistent with the fact that Z2 projection is usual orientifold projection and it does
not break the N = 4 supersymmetry. This index precisely agrees with the large N limit
of the index of N = 4 SO(N) and Sp(N) gauge theories, which is shown in Appendix B.
Diﬀerence of the supersymmetry between k = 1, 2 and k = 3, 4, 6 is also seen by looking
at S2, which corresponds to the energy-momentum multiplet of N = 4 theory. In [5] the
branching of the N = 4 energy momentum multiplet into N = 3 multiplets are examined.
The bottom components belonging to 20 of SU(4)R is decomposed into 80 + 6−4 + 6+4 of
SU(3) × U(1). This can be seen in the z-expansion of S2

(We set y = p = q′ = 1.) The z0 term, which is never projected out, corresponds to the
N = 3 energy-momentum multiplet, while the terms containing z±2 correspond to the
multiplets that include exactly marginal deformation and fourth supersymmetry current.
The latter is projected out when k ≥ 3, and genuine N = 3 theories are realized.
For rank 1 case a Zk orientifold theory has a Coulomb branch operator with dimension k
[8]. This is expected to be true for large N limit, too, because the Zk invariant coordinates
of C3/Zk are given as order k monomials of the coordinates zi that have dimension 1.
The corresponding contribution is found in the index. For Zk orientifold I KK
±k survive the
projection and when k ≥ 2 the leading terms in I KK

±k are given by

−k = t2kχk(p)q′k + O(t2k+1),

4 Finite N corrections

Now let us turn to ﬁnite N corrections. It is instructive to start from the k = 1 and k = 2
cases where we can calculate the index on the gauge theory side.

For k = 1 the theory is the N = 4 U(N) SYM. The index of the ﬁnite N theory is

related to I KK = IU (∞) by

IU (N ) = I KK − χ(N +1,0)t2(N +1) + O(t2N +3).

(4.1)

(See (A.5).) The leading correction is of order t2N +2 and its coeﬃcient is negative. On the
gauge theory side this comes from the fact that the gauge invariant operators of the form

trΦm

(4.2)

are independent only for m = 1, 2, . . . , N, and ones with m ≥ N + 1 can be decomposed
into the independent ones.
On the gravity side, they correspond to objects with angular momentum ℓ ∼ m. When
ℓ . N There are three states that have the same quantum numbers with the operator
(4.2).

• point-like graviton
• Giant graviton[15] (spherical D3-brane expanding in the S5)
• Dual giant graviton[16, 17] (spherical D3-brane expanding in the AdS5)

Although these three states are perturbatively all BPS, two of them can form a long
multiplet and only the remaining state contributes to the index [16]. If ℓ & N, however,
only point-like gravitons and giant gravitons exist. Their contributions to the index cancel
each other, and we eﬀectively have negative corrections compared to the large N limit.

The bound ℓ ∼ N comes from the ﬁnite radius of S5. It is the same as the AdS radius

L and is given by

L4 = 4πNgstrl4
s.

The mass MD3 of a D3-brane wrapped around a large S3 ⊂ S5 in the unit 1/L is

MD3L = 2π2L4TD3 = N.

(4.3)

(4.4)

At the second equality we used TD3 = 1/((2π)3l4
sgstr). There are no giant gravitons whose
energy exceeds this bound. This is easily generalized to the Zk orientifold. Because a
giant graviton wraps a topologically trivial cycle we can always use covering space S5 in
the calculation of the bound, and the only diﬀerence is that the number of the ﬂux N is
replaced by kN.

The k = 2 case is investigated in [10] in detail. An important feature of k ≥ 2 case is

that we have diﬀerent choices of discrete torsion classiﬁed by

tor = H 3(S5/Zk, ^Z + Z).
Γ(k)

(4.5)

9

^Z + Z represents pair of integers corresponding to two three-form ﬁeld strength H RR
and
3 , which has the Zk monodromy around the non-trivial cycle in S5/Zk. When k = 2
H NS
the internal space is RP5 = S5/Z2 and the monodromy around the non-trivial cycle is
(p, q) → (−p,−q). Because this monodromy does not mix the R-R and NS-NS ﬂuxes the
torsion in the k = 2 case is factorized into the direct sum

3

Γ(k=2)

tor = H 3(RP5,eZ) + H 3(RP5,eZ) = Z2 + Z2.

(4.6)

There are four cases, which we denote by (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0) and (1, 1) where the ﬁrst and
the second components represent the discrete torsion of H RR
3 , respectively. They
correspond to the following gauge groups [10].

and H NS

3

(0, 0) : SO(2N),

(1, 0) : SO(2N + 1),

(0, 1) : Sp(N),

(1, 1) : Sp(N).

(4.7)

The latter three are transformed among them by the SL(2, Z) Montonen-Olive duality,
while the SO(2N) theory corresponding to the trivial discrete torsion is self-dual.

Let us ﬁrst consider the SO(2N) theory corresponding to the trivial discrete torsion.

The index is 1

ISO(2N ) = I KK

Z2 + χ(N,0)t2N + O(t2N +1).

(4.8)

(See (A.7).) We have the leading correction of order t2N with the positive coeﬃcient. On
the gauge theory side, this is identiﬁed with the contribution of baryonic operators of the
form

B = Puﬀ Φ

(4.9)

with dimension E = N. On the gravity side, these correspond to D3-branes wrapped on
the topologically non-trivial cycle. Let H (k) be the 3-cycle homology of the internal space
S5/Zk. When k = 2 it is

H (k=2) = H3(RP5, Z) = Z2.

(4.10)

The non-trivial element of this homology group is RP3 ⊂ RP5. As we have shown above
the mass of a D3-brane wrapped on a large S3 is the same as the number of ﬂux passing
through S5 in the unit of 1/L, and it is 2N in the k = 2 case. By taking account of
Vol(RP3) = Vol(S3)/2, we obtain the dimension E ∼ N consistent with the correction in
(4.8).
When the discrete torsion is non-trivial, the corresponding SO(2N + 1) theory (or

Sp(N) theory) has the index

ISO(2N +1) = ISp(N ) = I KK

Z2 − (χ(2N +2,0) + · · · )t4N +4 + O(t4N +5).

(4.11)

1The gauge group of the theory is actually O(2N ) rather than SO(2N ). We treat Z2 = O(2N )/SO(2N )

as a global symmetry and we assume the trivial holonomy in the index calculation.

10

(See (A.8).) This time we have the leading correction of order t4N +4 with the negative
coeﬃcient, which corresponds to operators with dimension E ∼ 2N. (We are interested
in the O(N) behavior of the dimension, and do not pay attention to O(1) shift.) This is
explained in the same way as the k = 1 case by the bound for the giant graviton.
What is important here is that the positive contribution of baryonic operator of di-
mension E ∼ N, which gives the leading correction in the SO(2N) case, is absent.
In
the context of the gauge theory this is simply because we cannot deﬁne operators in the
form (4.9). On the gravity side this is explained by the topological obstruction to wrapped
D3-branes due to the non-vanishing discrete torsion [10].

Let K (k) be the charge lattice of the electric and magnetic charges on a D3-brane
wrapped on the cycle corresponding to the generating element of H (k), which has the
topology S3/Zk.

When k = 2 it is given by

K (k) ≡ H0(S3/Zk, ^Z + Z).

(4.12)

(4.13)

K (k=2) = H0(RP3, ^Z + Z) = H0(RP3,eZ) + H0(RP3,eZ) = Z2 + Z2.

The three form ﬂuxes, which are classiﬁed by Γ(k)
a wrapped D3-brane. This is described by the natural pairing

tor induce electric and magnetic charges on

f : H (k) × Γ(k)

tor → K (k).

(4.14)

The ﬂux conservation and the compactness of the wrapped D3-brane require the pairing
to vanish. For the discrete torsion (1, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 1), wrapped D3-branes gives non-
trivial element of K (k=2) and such wrappings are prohibited.

In the following we generalize the argument above to k ≥ 3 cases. For a general k the
3-cycle homology classifying wrapped D3-branes is determined by using the Gysin exact
sequence as

H (k) ≡ H3(S5/Zk, Z) = Zk.

(4.15)

We can obtain K (k) from the lattice Z + Z of electric and magnetic charges by taking
account of the non-trivial monodromy around the non-trivial cycle in S3/Zk. We identify
points in Z + Z related by the Zk rotation. As the result we obtain the following reduced
charge lattice

K (3) = Z3, K (4) = Z2, K (6) = 0.

(4.16)

To analyze the discrete torsion (4.5), it may be convenient to visualize the elements of

Γ(k)
tor as their Poincar´e duals, which are classiﬁed by the two-cycle homology group

tor = H2(S5/Zk, ^Z + Z).
Γ(k)

(4.17)

11

For k ≥ 3 the orientifold group mixes the NS-NS and R-R three-form ﬂuxes, and the
torsion does not factorize. An element of this group is regarded as a string worldsheet
Σ. To visualize Σ it is convenient to describe S5/Zk as a Hopf ﬁbration over CP2. The
Chern class of the ﬁber is k ∈ H 2(CP2, Z) = Z. Let B ∼ CP1 be a non-trivial two-cycle in
CP2. The restriction of the Hopf ﬁbration also has the Chern class k, and has the topology
S3/Zk. By using the Mayer-Vietoris exact sequence we can show the isomorphism

tor = H2(S5/Zk, ^Z + Z) ∼ H2(S3/Zk, ^Z + Z),
Γ(k)

(4.18)

and we can focus on the subspace S3/Zk ⊂ S5/Zk.
Roughly speaking, a non-trivial element of Γ(k)
tor can be represented as a worldsheet Σ
wrapped on a section over B. Of course, due to the non-vanishing Chern class, there is no
global section over B. Let B′ be the punctured sphere obtained by removing a point p from
B, and Cp the ﬁber over p. We can deﬁne a section Σ′ over B′, which has the topology of
a punctured sphere as B′. The reason why we cannot ﬁll in the puncture of Σ′ to obtain
a global section over B is that the boundary of Σ′ is not just a point-like puncture but S1
winding around Cp.

In fact, we can remove this puncture to obtain Σ for k ≥ 2. Let us ﬁrst consider k = 2
case. The boundary of Σ′ winds Cp twice. This means that two parts of the boundary
of Σ′ meet along Cp. Due to the non-trivial monodromy of the string charges around
Cp, the two worldsheets have opposite string charge to each other, and the boundary can
be consistently covered by a M¨obius strip wrapped around Cp. As the result we obtain
Σ = RP2, which wraps the non-trivial cycle in RP5.

A generalization to k ≥ 3 is straightforward. The Chern class of the ﬁbration over
B is now k, and the boundary of the worldsheet Σ′ winds k times around Cp. Namely, k
worldsheets, which are diﬀerent parts of Σ′, meet along Cp. We can stitch them consistently
into a k-valent junction because their (p, q) string charges are related by the Zk monodromy
and sum up to zero.

Once we ﬁx Σ for k ≥ 2, an element of the discrete torsion is speciﬁed by the (p, q) string
charge of the worldsheet. Charges transformed to each other by the Zk monodromy must
be identiﬁed, and after this identiﬁcation, we obtain the same groups as K (k) in (4.16).
This is also directly shown from the isomorphism H (tor)
n−i−1 for an n-dimensional
manifold.

∼ H (tor)

i

By using the worldsheet representation of the discrete torsion, we can easily determine
the pairing f : H × Γtor → K as the intersection of the worldsheet and the D3-brane
worldvolume. Let us consider case by case.

• k = 1

The 3-cycle homology is trivial and there exist no baryonic operators. The leading
term of the ﬁnite N correction is due to the bound of giant gravitons at E ∼ N.

• k = 2

12

The 3-cycle homology is H (k=2) = Z2 and the discrete torsion group and the charge
lattice is Γ(k=2)

tor = K (k=2) = Z2 + Z2. The pairing is

f : Z3 ⊗ (Z2 + Z2) → (Z2 + Z2).

(4.19)

This vanishes for a wrapped D3-brane only when the discrete torsion is trivial. Then
we have positive correction at E ∼ N. Otherwise, the leading correction is negative
one at E ∼ 2N.

• k = 3

H (k=3) = Γ(k=3)

tor = K (k=3) = Z3. The pairing is

f : Z3 ⊗ Z3 → Z3,

(4.20)

and this vanishes for non-trivial 3-cycle only when the discrete torsion vanishes.
Then we have the positive correction at E ∼ N. Otherwise, we have the negative
contribution at E ∼ 3N.

• k = 4

H (k=4) = Z4 and Γ(k=4)

tor = K (k=4) = Z2. The pairing is

f : Z4 ⊗ Z2 → Z2.

(4.21)

When the discrete torsion is trivial any winding number of a D3-brane is allowed,
and the leading correction is positive one at E ∼ N. Even when the discrete torsion
is non-trivial, we still have wrapped D3-branes with even wrapping number, and we
have positive correction at E ∼ 2N.

• k = 6

H (k=6) = Z6 and Γ(k=6)
tor = K (k=6) = 0. Because of the absence of the non-trivial dis-
crete torsion, any winding of D3-branes are allowed, and we have positive correction
at E ∼ N.

We summarize these results in Table 2.

5 Conclusions and Discussion

In this paper we have investigated the superconformal index of N = 3 Zk orientifold
superconformal theories by using AdS/CFT correspondence. The result in the large N
limit has been obtained by a simple Zk projection of the Kaluza-Klein modes. We have
checked that the result is consistent with some known properties of genuine N = 3 theories.
We have also discussed ﬁnite N corrections based on the assumption that corrections with
positive and negative coeﬃcients originate from D3-branes wrapped on non-trivial and
trivial cycles, respectively. We have determined the signature and large N behavior of the

exponent of the leading term in the t-expansion by examining the discrete torsion of the
three-form ﬂuxes.

It would be interesting to investigate more on BPS operators of N = 3 theories pre-
dicted from the index determined in this paper. When k = 2, the microscopic origin of
such BPS operators lies in BPS strings ending on D3-branes at the orbifold singularity.
Thus it may be natural to expect that BPS operators in N = 3 theory originate junctions
connecting D3-branes.
In this paper we treated the wrapped branes classically, and obtained only the coeﬃ-
cients of O(N 1) term in the exponent. To determine the exponent including O(1) part and
SU(3)R representation we need to perform quantum mechanical analysis of the collective
motion of the wrapped branes. It would be interesting to determine the conﬁguration of
such wrapped branes.

We represent the discrete torsion as two-cycles that are Poincar´e dual to the three-form
ﬂux, and study how the wrapped branes are aﬀected by the discrete torsion. The same
two-cycles can be used to realize domain walls. We can wrap (p, q) ﬁve branes on the
cycles. They divide the four-dimensional spacetime into two parts. On the two sides of a
domain wall the discrete torsions are diﬀerent by the amount depending on the homology
class of the wrapped ﬁvebrane. It may be interesting to study properties of such domain
walls by using the brane realization mentioned above.

We studied the discrete torsion in type IIB picture. In [4] discrete torsion in the M-
theory dual was investigated, and more variety than those of type IIB picture were found.
It may be interesting to study the relation between discrete torsions in type IIB theory and
M-theory. It may play important role when we discuss S1 compactiﬁcation of the N = 3
theory to three-dimensional theories.
As another example of wrapped branes on torsion-cycles in the dual internal geome-
try, one can consider a wrapped D1-brane on H1(S5/Zk). This object will correspond to
a monopole with fractional charge in the ﬁeld theory side. It would be intersting to in-

14

vestigate the properties of monopole with fractional charge from a purely ﬁeld-theoretical
viewpoint, as done for BPS states in unitary gauge group [18, 19].

We hope to come back to these issues in near future.

A The indices for small N

In this appendix we summarize the indices of N = 4 theories with small N, which are used

(A.1)

where f is the index for the letters of the N = 4 U(1) gauge theory, which are the
elementary BPS operators of the theory, given by

f (t, y, p, q) =

t2χ(1,0) − t3χ1 − t4χ(0,1) + 2t6

(1 − t3y)(1 − t3
y )

(A.2)

where χ(m,n) ≡ χ(m,n)(p, q) and χs ≡ χs(y) are the SU(3) and the SU(2) characters,
[dU] is the Haar measure of the gauge group and χadj(U m) is the character
respectively.
for the adjoint representation thereof, which describe the contributions of holonomy. The
letter index (A.2) contains both contributions from a N = 1 vector multiplet and three
N = 1 chiral ones, whose zero point contributions to the index cancel. Note also that
the holonomy contribution is already factored out from the letter index (A.2) since all the
ﬁelds belong to the adjoint representation. See also [20, 21].

For U(N) gauge group, χadj andR [dU] are given by

in the form of t-expansion by direct calculation. For U(N) gauge groups with N = 1, 2, 3, 4
we obtain

IU (1) =I KK − χ2,0t4 + χ1χ1,0t5 + (−χ3,0 + χ1,1 + 1)t6 − χ1χ0,1t7 + O(t8),

IU (4) =I KK − χ5,0t10 + O(t11).

These results show the pattern in (4.1).

For SO(2N) gauge group the adjoint character and the Haar measure are given by

We see the pattern of (4.8).

B Large N limit of SO(N ) index

In this appendix we give a brief derivation of large N limit of an index for N = 4 SYM
with orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups. For this purpose it is suﬃcient to consider
the case when the gauge group is SO(2N), since the large N index of SO(2N) matches
those of SO(2N + 1) and Sp(N). In this appendix we use the same convention as used in
[14].

For this end we ﬁrst restrict the range of holonomy from 0 to π by using the symmetry
of the index under ﬂip of sign of each holonomy for convenience. Then under the large N
limit the holonomy distributes densely between 0 and π, whose density function we denote
by ρ:

NXm=1

δ(α − αm),

ρ(α) = 1.

(B.1)

(B.2)

ρ(α) =

Since the range of α is restricted from 0 to π, the density function can be expanded by
cosine functions so that

Plugging these into the gauge index (A.1) and performing the integrations by Gaussian
