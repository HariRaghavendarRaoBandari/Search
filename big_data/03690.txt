MODELING SNR CASSIOPEIA A FROM THE SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION TO ITS CURRENT AGE:

THE ROLE OF POST-EXPLOSION ANISOTROPIES OF EJECTA

S. Orlando1, M. Miceli2,1, M.L. Pumo1, F. Bocchino1

ABSTRACT

The remnants of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) have complex morphologies that may reﬂect asym-
metries and structures developed during the progenitor SN explosion. Here we investigate how the
morphology of the SNR Cassiopeia A (Cas A) reﬂects the characteristics of the progenitor SN with
the aim to derive the energies and masses of the post-explosion anisotropies responsible for the ob-
served spatial distribution of Fe and Si/S. We model the evolution of Cas A from the immediate
aftermath of the progenitor SN to the three-dimensional interaction of the remnant with the sur-
rounding medium. The post-explosion structure of the ejecta is described by small-scale clumping of
material and larger-scale anisotropies. The hydrodynamic multi-species simulations consider an ap-
propriate post-explosion isotopic composition of the ejecta. The observed average expansion rate and
shock velocities can be well reproduced by models with ejecta mass Mej ≈ 4M⊙ and explosion energy
ESN ≈ 2.3 × 1051 erg. The post-explosion anisotropies (pistons) reproduce the observed distributions
of Fe and Si/S if they had a total mass of ≈ 0.25 M⊙ and a total kinetic energy of ≈ 1.5 × 1050 erg.
The pistons produce a spatial inversion of ejecta layers at the epoch of Cas A, leading to the Si/S-rich
ejecta physically interior to the Fe-rich ejecta. The pistons are also responsible for the development
of bright rings of Si/S-rich material which form at the intersection between the reverse shock and the
material accumulated around the pistons during their propagation. Our result supports the idea that
the bulk of asymmetries observed in Cas A are intrinsic to the explosion.

1. INTRODUCTION

It is generally accepted that the highly non-uniform
distribution of ejecta observed in core-collapse supernova
remnants (SNRs) might reﬂect pristine structures and
features of the progenitor supernova (SN) explosion (e.g.
Lopez et al. 2011). Thus the analysis of inhomogeneities
observed in the morphology of SNRs might help to trace
back the characteristics of the asymmetries that may
have occurred during the SN explosion, providing a phys-
ical insight into the processes governing the SN engines.
On the other hand, the morphology of SNRs is expected
to reﬂect also the interaction of the SN blasts with the in-
homogeneous ambient medium. Disentangling the eﬀect
of this interaction from the eﬀects of the SN explosion
is one of the major problems in linking the present day
morphology of SNRs to their SN progenitors.

The SNe-SNRs connection can be best studied in
young SNRs, for which the imprint of SN explosion on
their morphology might be identiﬁed more easily, be-
fore the remnants start to interact with the inhomoge-
neous interstellar medium (ISM). Cassiopeia A (in the
following Cas A) is an attractive laboratory for study-
ing the early evolutionary phase of a SNR. In fact the
observations suggest that its morphology and expansion
rate are consistent with the model of a remnant expand-
ing through the wind of the progenitor red supergiant
(RSG) (e.g. Chevalier & Oishi 2003; Laming & Hwang
2003; Hwang & Laming 2009; Lee et al. 2014).

Also Cas A is one of the best studied remnant and
its three-dimensional (3D) structure has been char-
acterized in good details (e.g. DeLaney et al. 2010;
Milisavljevic & Fesen 2013, 2015). One of the out-
standing characteristics of its morphology is the overall
clumpiness, most likely due to pristine ejecta clumpiness
resulting from instabilities and mixing throughout the
remnant evolution. The masses of X-ray-emitting ejecta
and the mass distribution of various elements over the
remnant have been derived accurately from the observa-
tions (e.g. Hwang & Laming 2012).

From the 3D reconstruction of the spatial distribu-
tion of ejecta, DeLaney et al. (2010) suggested that the
structure of Cas A consists of a spherical component
(roughly coincident with the forward shock), a tilted
thick disk, and several ejecta jets/protrusions, the most
prominent of which are the southeast (SE) and north-
west (NW) Fe-rich regions and the high velocity north-
east (NE) and southwest (SW) streams of Si-rich debris
(often referred to as “jets”). The jet/protrusion fea-
tures have been interpreted as the result of “pistons” of
faster than average ejecta emerging from the SN explo-
sion (DeLaney et al. 2010). According to this scenario,
the bright rings of ejecta clearly visible in Cas A and cir-
cling the jets/pistons represent the intersection of these
pistons with the reverse shock.

An alternative explanation of the rings has been pro-
posed by Blondin et al. (2001) who suggested that they
represent cross-sections of large cavities in the expand-
ing ejecta created by expanding plumes of radioactive
56Ni-rich ejecta (see also Li et al. 1993). This scenario is
supported by the analysis of near-infrared observations of
Cas A that revealed a bubble-like morphology of the rem-

nant’s interior that may originate from the compression
of surrounding non-radioactive material by the expand-
ing radioactive 56Ni-rich ejecta (Milisavljevic & Fesen
2015). Against this idea there is however the advanced
ionization age relative to other elements of X-ray emit-
ting shocked Fe (e.g. Hwang & Laming 2012).
In fact
Fe-rich ejecta associated with the Ni bubble eﬀect are
expected to have low ionization ages, at odds with ob-
servations.

A better understanding of the present day structure
and chemical stratiﬁcation of ejecta in Cas A requires
therefore to study the evolution of chemically homoge-
neous ejecta layers since the SN event, in order to map
the layers at the explosion to the resulting abundance
pattern observed at the current age. Some eﬀort in this
direction has been done for other SNRs mostly by using
a one-dimensional (1D) approach to overcome the diﬃ-
culty of the very diﬀerent time and space scales of SNe
and SNRs (e.g. Badenes et al. 2008; Yamaguchi et al.
2014; Patnaude et al. 2015). However these models miss
all the complex spatial structures (requiring 3D simula-
tions) observed in SNRs and so diﬃcult to interpret. Re-
cently a 3D model describing the evolution of SN 1987A
since the SN event has been used to identify the imprint
of the SN on the remnant emission (Orlando et al. 2015).
In the attempt to link the ejecta structure of Cas A
to the properties of its progenitor SN, we developed a
hydrodynamic model describing the evolution of Cas A
from the immediate aftermath of the progenitor SN ex-
plosion, to the interaction of the remnant with the RSG
wind. The model considers complete and realistic condi-
tions of the early post-explosion ejecta structure, includ-
ing the isotopic composition of the ejecta appropriate for
the expected progenitor star.

(2010).

In this paper we challenge the scenario of high ve-
locity pistons of ejecta emerging from the SN ex-
plosion proposed by DeLaney et al.
We
describe the post-explosion structure of
the ejecta
through small-scale clumping of material and larger-scale
anisotropies (possibly due to hydrodynamic instabili-
ties; e.g. Kifonidis et al. 2006; Wang & Wheeler 2008;
Gawryszczak et al. 2010). We investigate the eﬀects of
the initial ejecta structure on the ﬁnal remnant morphol-
ogy with the aim to determine the energies and masses of
the post-explosion anisotropies responsible for the spatial
distribution of Fe and Si/S observed today in Cas A.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we de-
scribe the hydrodynamic model and the numerical setup,
in Section 3 we discuss the results and, ﬁnally, we draw
our conclusions in Section 4.

2. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION AND NUMERICAL SETUP
Our simulations assume a pre-SN environment and ini-
tial conditions for the SN explosion that are appropriate
for a progenitor RSG (see Sect. 2.1). Our approach fol-
lows that described by Orlando et al. (2015): ﬁrst, we
simulate the post-explosion evolution of the SN soon af-
ter the core-collapse (see Sect. 2.2); then the output of
these simulations are used to start 3D hydrodynamic sim-
ulations describing the expansion of ejecta through the
pre-SN environment (see Sect. 2.3).

2.1. The adopted progenitor star

The optical spectrum of the progenitor SN of Cas A
(derived from its scattered light echo; Krause et al. 2008)
is remarkably similar to that of the prototypical type
IIb SN 1993J (Nomoto et al. 1993). Thus, as for SN
1993J, Cas A might have originated from the collapse of
a RSG with a main sequence (MS) mass of 13 to 20 M⊙
that had lost most of its hydrogen envelope before ex-
ploding (Nomoto et al. 1993; Aldering et al. 1994). This
scenario is also supported by several observational con-
straints that indicate that the total ejecta mass of Cas A
was only of 2 to 4 M⊙ (Young et al. 2006 and references
therein) with about 1 − 2 M⊙ of oxygen (Willingale et al.
2003). Considering the presence of the neutron star, this
ejecta mass is consistent with a core mass at the end of
the RSG phase of about 6 M⊙ (as that inferred for SN
1993J; Nomoto et al. 1993); the presence of a signiﬁcant
fraction of oxygen-rich ejecta suggests a MS mass for the
progenitor close to 20 M⊙ (Thielemann et al. 1996).

The scenario of a progenitor with a MS mass of 20
M⊙ poses the problem if it evolved also through a Wolf-
Rayet (WR) phase3 or not. Several studies suggest that
the current morphology and expansion rate of Cas A are
consistent with a remnant interacting with the wind of
a RSG (e.g. Chevalier & Oishi 2003; Laming & Hwang
2003; Hwang & Laming 2009; Lee et al. 2014). The pres-
ence of slow-moving shocked circumstellar clumps in the
remnant (the so-called quasi-stationary ﬂocculi) has been
interpreted as signature of a WR phase of the progeni-
tor: the ﬂocculi are fragments of the RSG shell swept-up
by a later WR wind (e.g. Garcia-Segura et al. 1996).
However, more recent studies have shown that these
ﬂocculi can be explained as dense clumps in the RSG
wind (Chevalier & Oishi 2003; van Veelen et al. 2009)
and that the morphology of Cas A is consistent with an
evolution of the progenitor without (or with a short -
a few thousand years) WR phase (Schure et al. 2008;
van Veelen et al. 2009).

On the other hand, we note that the analysis of op-
tical observations suggests that stars with a MS mass
above4 ≈ 17 M⊙ should not appear to explode as RSGs
leading to standard type II Plateau SNe (Smartt 2009).
A similar result has been obtained from the analysis of
X-ray observations which put as upper limit to the mass
of a RSG star exploding as SN M = 19 M⊙ (Dwarkadas
2014). In the light of these considerations, and following
van Veelen et al. (2009), we assume for our simulations
that the progenitor of Cas A was a star with an initial
mass between 15 and 20 M⊙ (according to the values sug-
gested, e.g. by Aldering et al. 1994; Lee et al. 2014) that
evolved through a RSG phase and did not have a WR
phase. Thus the pre-SN environment immediately close
to the SN was determined by the dense slow wind from
the RSG.

X-ray observations show that currently the remnant is
still interacting with this wind with a post-shock density

3 The lower limit of the mass of a MS star that can evolve
through a WR phase depends on the initial metallicity of the
star (e.g. Crowther 2007) and is considered to be > 20M⊙
(Meynet & Maeder 2005).

4 However it should be noted that this value is still questioned
from both the theoretical and the observational point of view (e.g.
Kochanek et al. 2012, and references therein).

ranging between 3 and 5 cm−3 at the current outer radius
of the remnant, rfs ≈ 2.5 pc (asuming a distance of ≈
3.4 kpc; Lee et al. 2014). Neglecting the back-reaction
of accelerated cosmic rays (CRs) at the shock front, the
upper limit to the wind density at rfs ≈ 2.5 pc is nw ≈
0.9±0.3 cm−3. Assuming that the gas density in the wind
is proportional to r−2 (where r is the radial distance from
the progenitor), the amount of mass of the wind within
the radius of the forward shock rfs is (Lee et al. 2014)

Mw,sh = R ρ(r) 4πr2dr = R ρw(r2

fs/r2) 4πr2dr

≈ 4πρwr3

fs ≈ 6M⊙

(1)

where ρw = µmHnw is the mass density of the wind
at r = rfs, µ = 1.3 is the mean atomic mass (assuming
cosmic abundances), and mH is the mass of the hydrogen
atom. Since the total mass lost during the RSG phase is
expected to be5 between 9 and 14 M⊙, we expect that the
RSG wind shell has a radius larger than rfs. Therefore,
we can safely assume that Cas A is still evolving through
the RSG wind with an initial r−2 density proﬁle.

2.2. Modeling the post-explosion evolution of the

supernova

We modeled the post-explosion evolution of the SN
by adopting a 1D Lagrangian code in spherical ge-
ometry. The code solves the equations of relativistic
radiation hydrodynamics, for a self-gravitating matter
ﬂuid interacting with radiation, as described in detail in
Pumo & Zampieri (2011). The code is fully general rel-
ativistic and provides an accurate treatment of radiative
transfer at all regimes, thus allowing us to deal with op-
tically thick and optically thin ejecta. The code includes
the coupling of the radiation moment equations with the
equations of relativistic hydrodynamics (during all the
post-explosive phases) and the heating eﬀects associated
with the decays of the radioactive yields of the explosive
nuclesynthesis process. Also, the gravitational eﬀects of
the central compact object on the evolution of the ejecta
are taken into account.

We followed the evolution of the stellar ejecta from
the shock breakout at the stellar surface up to when the
envelope has recombined and the radioactive decays of
the explosive nucleosynthesis products dominates the en-
ergy budget (the so-called nebular stage). Also the code
computes the fallback of material on the central com-
pact object and consequently determines the amount of
56Ni in the ejected envelope at late times. The code
has been widely used to model the observations of core-
collapse SNe (e.g. Spiro et al. 2014; Tak´ats et al. 2014;
Dall’Ora et al. 2014; Pastorello et al. 2012), having also
the capability of simulating the bolometric lightcurve and
the time evolution of the photospheric velocity and tem-
perature.

We set the initial conditions of our simulations to
mimic the physical properties of the ejected mate-
rial after shock passage following the core-collapse (see
Pumo & Zampieri 2011 for details). The parameters of
our model setups are: the progenitor radius R0, the total

ejecta energy ESN, the envelope mass at shock breakout
Menv, and the total amount of 56Ni initially present in the
ejected envelope MNi. Note that the value Menv indicates
the initial mass of the material surrounding the compact
object (which has a mass Mcut = 1.6 M⊙ at the onset of
our simulations). In all the simulations presented here,
most of this mass is ejected in the post-explosive phases,
and only a minor part (of the order of a few hundredths
of a solar mass) falls back to the central object. We can
then conclude that the mass of the ejecta Mej ≈ Menv.

We explored diﬀerent values of R0, and ESN, ﬁxing the
envelope mass Menv = 4M⊙ (according to Young et al.
2006 and van Veelen et al. 2009), and the initial amount
of 56Ni MNi = 0.1M⊙ (consistent with the range of values
derived by Eriksen et al. 2009 for Cas A6). In particular,
we considered models with ESN ranging between 1 and
3 × 1051 erg, and R0 ranging between 100 and 1000 R⊙
(namely the range of values expected for a RSG; e.g.
Levesque et al. 2005). In the set of models explored, the
maximum velocity of the ejecta immediately after the
shock breakout is in the range 8000 − 15000 km s−1. For
a given density of the RSG wind, models with diﬀerent
values of ESN and R0 produce remnants at t = 340 yr
characterized by diﬀerent radii and velocities of the for-
ward and reverse shocks. As explained in more details in
Sect. 3.1, we searched for the values of ESN and R0 best
reproducing altogether the density of the shocked RSG
wind inferred from observations (Lee et al. 2014) and the
radii and velocities of the forward and reverse shocks as
observed at the current time (t ≈ 340 yr; see Table 1).

2.3. Modeling the evolution of the supernova remnant

After we have simulated in 1D the post-explosion
evolution of the SN soon after the core-collapse (see
Sect. 2.2), we mapped the output of these simulations
in 3D and, then, started 3D hydrodynamic simulations
which describe the interaction of the remnant with the
wind of the progenitor RSG. We modeled the evolution of
the blast wave by numerically solving the time-dependent
ﬂuid equations of mass, momentum, and energy conser-
vation in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system (x, y, z); the
hydrodynamic equations were extended to include the ef-
fects of the radiative losses from an optically thin plasma:

5 This is the diﬀerence between the stellar mass at the end of
the MS phase, in the range between 15 and 20 M⊙, and the core
mass at the end of the RSG phase, 6 M⊙.

6 The adopted value is also consistent with the amount of Ni
synthesized during the explosion of a RSG star with a MS mass
between 15 and 20 M⊙ (Thielemann et al. 1996).

the equations
for compressible gas dynamics with
the FLASH implementation of the piecewise-parabolic
method (Colella & Woodward 1984).
The radiative
losses Λ in Eq. 2 are calculated through a table
lookup/interpolation method. Also we extended the
code by additional computational modules to calcu-
late the deviations from electron-proton temperature-
equilibration and the deviations from equilibrium of ion-
ization of the most abundant ions. For the former, we
calculated the ion and electron temperatures in each
cell of the post-shock medium, taking into account the
eﬀects of Coulomb collisions (see Orlando et al. 2015
for the details of the implementation). According to
Ghavamian et al. (2007), ﬁrst the electrons are assumed
to be heated at the shock front almost istantaneously
up to kT ∼ 0.3 keV by lower hybrid waves. This is-
tantaneous heating does not depend on the shock Mach
number and is expected for fast shocks (i.e. > 103 km
s−1) as those simulated here. Then we considered the
eﬀects of the Coulomb collisions to calculate the evolu-
tion of ion and electron temperatures in each cell of the

post-shock medium in the time ∆tj = t − tshj, where
tshj is the time when the plasma in the j-th domain cell
was shocked and t is the current time. The time tshj is
stored in an additional passive tracer added to the model
equations. To estimate the deviations from equilibrium
of ionization of the most abundant ions, we adopted the
approach suggested by Dwarkadas et al. (2010). In fact,
this approach ensures high eﬃciency in the calculation
(expecially in the case of 3D simulations as in our case)
together with a reasonable accuracy in the evaluation of
non-equilibrium of ionization eﬀects. The approach con-
sists in the computation of the maximum ionization age
in each cell of the spatial domain τj = nej∆tj, where
nej is the electron density in the j-th cell and ∆tj is the
time since when the plasma in the cell was shocked (see
above).

The non-thermal emission detected in Cas A indicates
that eﬀective acceleration of CRs to energies exceeding
100 TeV occurs at the shock fronts (e.g. Abdo et al.
2010; Yuan et al. 2013). Thus we included in the model
also the modiﬁcations of the shock dynamics due to the
back-reaction of accelerated CRs by following the ap-
proach of Ferrand et al. (2010) (see also Orlando et al.
2012). More in details, we included an eﬀective adiabatic
index γeﬀ which depends on the injection rate of particles
η (i.e. the fraction of ISM particles entering the shock
front) and on the time. At each time-step of integration,
γeﬀ is calculated at the shock front through linear inter-
polation from a lookup table derived by Ferrand et al.
(2010) on the basis of the semi-analytical model of Blasi
(2002, 2004). Then γeﬀ is advected within the remnant,
remaining constant in each ﬂuid element. Fig. 2 shows
the eﬀective adiabatic index γeﬀ at the shock front versus
time for constant values of the injection rate η (derived
from Ferrand et al. 2010).

We started the 3D simulations once almost all (> 98%)
the explosion energy is kinetic (in most of our simulations
this happens few days after the SN explosion). Then we
followed the expansion of the remnant through the RSG
wind during the ﬁrst 340 years of evolution. The initial
remnant radius varies between 20 and 200 AU (namely
between 10−4 and 10−3 pc), depending on the initial ra-
dius of the progenitor star. The output of the SN simu-
lations provides the initial radial structure of the ejecta

for the SNR simulations.

Several theoretical studies predict that the remnants
of core-collapse SNe are characterized by small-scale
clumping of material and larger-scale anisotropies (e.g.
Li et al. 1993; Wang et al. 2002; Kifonidis et al. 2006;
Wang & Wheeler 2008; Gawryszczak et al. 2010, and
references therein). Since these structures cannot be
described by our 1D SN simulations, we account for
them by prescribing an initial clumpy structure of the
ejecta and large-scale anisotropies (as suggested by
Kifonidis et al. 2006), after the 1D radial density distri-
bution of ejecta (calculated with the SN simulations) is
mapped into 3D.

The small-scale ejecta clumps are modeled as per-cell
random density perturbations7. Following Orlando et al.
(2012), we derived these perturbations by adopting a
power-law probability distribution with index ξ = −1.
The parameter characterizing the distribution is the
maximum density perturbation that is possible to reach
in the simulation. For the purposes of this paper, we as-
sumed that the small-scale clumps have initial size about
2% of the initial remnant radius and a maximum den-
sity contrast (namely a density perturbation) νmax = 5.
These values are in agreement with those suggested by
spectropolarimetric studies of SNe (e.g. Wang et al.
2003, 2004; Wang & Wheeler 2008; Hole et al. 2010).

The post-explosion large-scale anisotropies in the
ejecta distribution are modeled as overdense spherical
knots (hereafter called “shrapnels”) in pressure equilib-
rium with the surrounding ejecta8. Our primary goal
is to derive the mass and energy of the anisotropies re-
sponsible for the inhomogeneous distribution of Fe and
Si/S observed today in Cas A. To this end, we explored
the space of parameters characterizing the initial shrap-
nels to ﬁnd those best reproducing the observations. In
particular, we considered shrapnels initially located ei-
ther within or outside the iron core, at distance Dknot
from the center, with radius rknot ranging between 3%
and 10% of the initial remnant radius, with density be-
tween 10 and 100 times larger than those of the sur-
rounding ejecta at distance Dknot (density contrast χn),
and with radial velocity between 1 and 3.5 times larger
than that of the surrounding ejecta (velocity contrast
χv). These ranges of values are consistent with those de-
rived from multi-dimensional simulations of core-collapse
SNe which show that Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities are
seeded by the ﬂow-structures resulting from neutrino-
driven convection and are eﬀective at creating metal-rich
knots at the terminal ends of Rayleigh-Taylor ﬁngers
(e.g. Kifonidis et al. 2003; Ellinger et al. 2012). These
knots present dimensions ranging between 2% and 16%
of the remnant radius at the time of knot formation and
are more than one order of magnitude denser than the
surrounding ejecta (e.g. Ellinger et al. 2012). Also the
simulations show that the metal ﬁngers and clumps are
much faster than the surrounding medium (with veloc-
ities up to 5000 km s−1) and are correlated with the

not change signiﬁcantly if the initial temperature of the shrapnel
was the same as that of the surrounding ejecta.

ter (e.g. Wongwathanarat et al. 2015).

As initial

isotopic composition of the ejecta, we
adopted that derived by Thielemann et al. (1996) for a
core-collapse SN either from a 15 M⊙ or from a 20 M⊙
MS star, namely the extremes of the range of masses
suggested in the literature (e.g. Aldering et al. 1994;
Lee et al. 2014). Fig. 3 shows the dominant abun-
dances of elements that we follow in details during
the evolution. These elements are those that can al-
low us to compare the distribution of chemical ho-
mogeneous regions of ejecta derived from the simula-
tions with those derived from the analysis of observa-
tions (e.g. DeLaney et al. 2010; Hwang & Laming 2012;
Milisavljevic & Fesen 2013, 2015). The mean atomic
mass µ for the ejecta considers their isotopic composi-
tion (Thielemann et al. 1996), whereas µ = 1.3 for the
RSG wind, assuming cosmic abundances.

As discussed in Sect. 2.1, we assume that the blast
wave from the SN explosion propagates through the
wind of the progenitor RSG during the whole evolu-
tion. The wind is assumed to be spherically symmet-
ric with gas density proportional to r−2 (where r is the
radial distance from the progenitor). The wind density
at r = 2.5 pc is constrained by X-ray observations of the

shocked wind (Lee et al. 2014). Since the shock compres-
sion ratio varies with the injection rate, the wind density
is diﬀerent for models with diﬀerent η (see Table 2) in
order to obtain the same post-shock density as inferred
from the observations.

We studied the chemical evolution of the ejecta by
adopting the multiple ﬂuids approach present in FLASH
(Fryxell et al. 2000). Each ﬂuid is associated to one of
the heavy elements shown in Fig. 3 and initialized with
the corresponding abundances of elements reported in
the ﬁgure. In such a way, we followed the evolution of the
isotopic composition of the ejecta and mapped the spa-
tial distribution of heavy elements at the present epoch.
During the remnant evolution, the diﬀerent ﬂuids mix
together. At any time t the density of a speciﬁc element
in a ﬂuid cell is given by ρel = ρCel, where Cel is the
mass fractions of each element and the index “el” refers
to a diﬀerent element.

The SN explosion is assumed to sit at the origin of the
3D Cartesian coordinate system (x0, y0, z0) = (0, 0, 0).
The computational domain extends 6 pc in the x, y, and
z directions (the current outer radius of the remnant is
≈ 2.5 pc, assuming a distance of ≈ 3.4 kpc; Reed et al.
1995). We assume zero-gradient (outﬂow) conditions at
all boundaries.

The SN explosion and subsequent evolution of Cas A
involve very diﬀerent length and time scales, from the rel-
atively small size of the very fast evolving system in the
immediate aftermath of the SN explosion (the remnant
radius at the beginning of the 3D hydrodynamic simula-
tions is between 10−4 and 10−3 pc) to the larger exten-
sion of the slowly expanding remnant (the ﬁnal remnant
radius is ≈ 2.5 pc). This makes rather challenging the 3D
modeling of Cas A and we were able to capture the very
diﬀerent scales involved, by exploiting the adaptive mesh
reﬁnement capabilities of FLASH. More speciﬁcally, we
employed 20 nested levels of reﬁnement, with resolution
increasing twice at each reﬁnement level. The reﬁne-
ment/dereﬁnement of the mesh is guided by the changes
in mass density and temperature and follows the crite-
rion of L¨ohner (1987). In addition we kept the computa-
tional cost approximately constant during the evolution,
by adopting an automatic mesh dereﬁnement scheme in
the whole spatial domain (Orlando & Drake 2012): we
gradually decreased the maximum number of reﬁnement
levels from 20 (at the beginning of the simulations) to 6
(at the end) following the expansion of the remnant. The
eﬀective spatial resolution reached at the ﬁnest level was

≈ 10−6 pc (≈ 10−2 pc) at the beginning (at the end)
of the simulations, corresponding to an eﬀective mesh
size of [5 × 106]3 ([512]3).
In such a way, the number
of grid zones per radius of the remnant Npt was > 100
during the whole evolution, with Npt ≈ 100 at t = 0 and
Npt > 250 at t = 340 yr.

3. RESULTS

3.1. The case of a spherically symmetric explosion

As a ﬁrst step, we explored the parameter space of the
SN-SNR model, assuming a 3D spherically symmetric SN
explosion. The simulations considered, therefore, include
the small-scale clumpy structure of the ejecta but do not
consider any large-scale anisotropy (i.e. the shrapnels;
see Sect. 2.3). The aim was to derive the best-ﬁt basic
parameters of the model (ejecta mass, explosion energy,
RSG wind density, and eﬃciency of CR acceleration) by
comparing model results with observations, in view of the
study concerning the eﬀects of large-scale anisotropies on
the remnant morphology.

Our observing constraints are the radii and velocities
of the forward and reverse shocks as observed at cur-
rent time (reported in Table 1; see also van Veelen et al.
2009). Another constraint is the density of the shocked
RSG wind that is inferred to range between 3 and 5 cm−3
from the analysis of Chandra observations (Lee et al.
2014). Thus we searched for the parameters (R0, ESN,
and Menv) of the SN model which reproduce altogether
the observed density of the shocked wind and the ob-
served radii and velocities of the forward and reverse
shocks.
Since the non-thermal emission detected in
Cas A indicates that eﬀective acceleration of CRs occurs
at the shock fronts (e.g. Abdo et al. 2010), we explored
also diﬀerent values of the injection rate η (see Sect. 2.3)
to account the feedback of CR acceleration on the rem-
nant expansion. Considering that the shock compression
ratio increases with η (due to a faster decrease of the ef-
fective adiabatic index; see Fig. 2), we varied accordingly
the pre-shock wind density nw at r = 2.5 pc (namely the
current outer radius of Cas A).

In all the cases explored, the SN-SNR simulations con-
sist of two main phases: the post-explosion evolution of
the supernova (lasting few hundreds days since the out-
burst) and the transition from SN to SNR. The ﬁrst
phase starts when the shock wave following the core-
collapse reaches the stellar surface. Then the evolution
follows the general trend described by Pumo & Zampieri
(2011) and it is brieﬂy summarized below. Initially the
envelope is completely ionized and optically thick. Most
of the internal energy is gradually released, contributing
to the gross emission of the SN. Few days after, the ejecta
start to recombine and the shock front recedes through
the envelope. In this phase, the resulting sudden release
of energy dominates the SN emission. After the envelope
is fully recombined and optically thin to optical photons,
the SN emission originates from the thermalization of the
energy deposited by γ-ray photons.

The second phase starts few hundreds days after the
SN event. We followed the transition from SN to SNR
for 340 years. During this time a forward and a reverse
shocks are formed, the former propagating into the RSG
wind and the latter driven back into the ejecta. The
ejecta clumps interact with each other and enhance the

development of hydrodynamic instabilities that enhance
the mixing of layers with diﬀerent isotopic composition.
At t = 340 yr we compared the angle-averaged radii
and velocities of the forward and reverse shocks resulting
from our models with those observed. Fig. 4 shows these
quantities for the models best reproducing the observa-
tions together with the observed values at the current
epoch. The models in the ﬁgure diﬀer from each other
for the injection rate η and, consequently, for the wind
density nw at r = 2.5 pc (see Table 2). We found that
the observations are best reproduced by models charac-
terized by a total ejecta energy ESN = 2.3 × 1051 erg, an
envelope mass Menv = 4 M⊙ (which has been ﬁxed in our
simulations), and a progenitor radius R0 = 350 R⊙. Our
best-ﬁt explosion energy is in good agreement with the
value inferred from the observations, ESN ≈ 2 × 1051 erg
(e.g. Laming & Hwang 2003; Hwang & Laming 2003);
the ejecta mass is within the range of values discussed in
the literature, Mej = 2 − 4M⊙ (e.g. Laming & Hwang
2003; Hwang & Laming 2003; Young et al. 2006). We
note that our model predicts a total energy which is
smaller than that found by Chevalier & Oishi (2003),
ESN ≈ 4 × 1051 erg, on the basis of a 1D hydrodynamic
model. Apart from the eﬀects of ejecta clumping that
are not included in their model, these authors consider
a mass of ejecta, Mej = 3.2 M⊙, which is signiﬁcantly
smaller than that adopted here. As a consequence, in

their case, a larger total explosion energy is required to ﬁt
the observed radius of Cas A. Table 2 summarizes the ba-
sic parameters characterizing the SN-SNR models which
best-ﬁt our observing constraints: injection rate η, wind
density nw at r = 2.5 pc, and the fraction of explosion en-
ergy converted to CRs Ecr at t = 340 yr; all these models
have the same ejecta mass Menv, explosion energy ESN,
and progenitor pre-SN radius R0.

As expected, the back-reaction of accelerated CRs
mainly aﬀects the density structure of the region between
the forward and reverse shocks. There the plasma is
characterized by an eﬀective adiabatic index γeﬀ which
depends on η and varies between ≈ 4/3 and 5/3 (see
Fig. 2). As a result, the density jump at the shock
σ = (γeﬀ + 1)/(γeﬀ − 1) varies between 7 and 4. The
ejecta clumping enhances the growth of Rayleigh-Taylor
instabilities at the contact discontinuity (Orlando et al.
2012). The CR acceleration enhances even further these
instabilities. This is shown in Fig. 5 that presents 2D
sections in the (x, z) plane of the spatial distribution of
plasma density at t = 340 yr for models with diﬀerent
η (runs SN-4M-2.3E-1ETA, SN-4M-2.3E-4ETA, SN-4M-
2.3E-6ETA, and SN-4M-2.3E-10ETA). As a consequence
of the enhanced intershock Rayleigh-Taylor mixing, the
shell of shocked wind is thinner at the forward shock for
higher values of η and, consequently, the separation be-
tween the forward shock and the contact discontinuity
is smaller. Panel (c) and, especially, panel (d) of Fig. 5
also show that the enhanced mixing can easily spread the
ejecta material close to, or even beyond, the average ra-
dius of the forward shock, depending on the size and den-
sity contrast of the initial clumps (see also Orlando et al.
2012; Miceli et al. 2013 for more details).

tion of the isotopic composition of ejecta, focusing on the
ﬂuids tracing the isotopes of Fe, Si, and S (see Fig. 6),
namely those characterizing most of the anisotropies (e.g.
jets, pistons) identiﬁed in the morphology of Cas A (e.g.
DeLaney et al. 2010). We investigated their spatial dis-
tribution at t = 340 yr in the case of a progenitor MS
star of either 15M⊙ or 20M⊙ and estimated the frac-
tion of their mass which is expected to be shocked. We
found that, in average, the stratiﬁcation of chemical lay-
ers at the present age reﬂects the radial distribution of
ejecta in the immediate aftermath of the progenitor SN.
It is interesting to note that, from observations, there
is evidence that the onion-skin nucleosynthetic layering
of the SN has been preserved in some regions of Cas A
(Fesen et al. 2006; DeLaney et al. 2010).

On the other hand, in all models of spherically symmet-
ric explosion, the masses of shocked Si and S are signiﬁ-
cantly lower (by more than 40%) than inferred from ob-
servations. More important, we found that no signiﬁcant
amount (< 10−3M⊙) of shocked Fe is predicted at odds
with the results of observations (Hwang & Laming 2012).
At ﬁrst sight, this result may appear to be not surprising,
given that the Fe lies deeply in the remnant interior in all
our models and the bulk of it has not been reached by the
reverse shock at the age of Cas A. However, the ejecta are
known to be characterized by a clumpy structure. This
may lead to the mixing of initially chemically homoge-
neous layers and to some overturning of the ejecta due
to hydrodynamic instabilities developing during clumps
interaction. Our 3D hydrodynamic model shows that the
small-scale clumping of ejecta cannot account for the ob-
served redistribution of elements in chemically distinct
layers of ejecta in Cas A.

3.2. Eﬀect of a post-explosion anisotropy of ejecta

The results of Sect. 3.1 strongly support the idea that
violent dynamical processes have characterized the SN
explosion and led to a redistribution of heavy elements in
the outer chemical layers. Possible examples of these pro-
cesses are uneven neutrino heating, axisymmetric mag-
netorotational eﬀects, hydrodynamic instabilities (e.g.
Kifonidis et al. 2003; Wheeler et al. 2002).

Here we investigate how the parameters (size, density,
and velocity) of a post-explosion anisotropy formed few
hours after the SN event may determine the redistri-
bution of Fe, Si, and S in the outer chemical layers of
the remnant. As discussed in Sect. 2.3, the anisotropy
is included in the simulations by modeling a large-scale
spherical knot (a shrapnel) with given size, density, and
velocity. To reduce the computational cost, we per-
formed 3D simulations by considering only one octant
of the whole spatial domain (namely the domain extends
between 0 and 3 pc in the x, y, and z directions; see
Sect 2.3) and limiting the study to the case of a pro-
genitor MS star of 20 M⊙. Reﬂecting boundary condi-
tions were used at x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0, consistent
with the adopted symmetry. Note that analogous simu-
lations have been performed by Miceli et al. (2013) and
Tsebrenko & Soker (2015) but in two-dimensions (2D).
A major diﬀerence with those simulations is that our 3D
model describes the post-explosion evolution of the SN
and traces the evolution of the isotopic composition of
ejecta since few hours after the SN event.

shock within the observational uncertainty so that, from
the comparison of model results with observations, it is
not possible to constrain the value of η. Nevertheless we
note that models with low values of η tend to underes-
timate the radius of the reverse shock and overestimate
the velocity of the forward shock. In general our models
predict a velocity of the reverse shock which is slightly
lower than observed.

For each of the models ﬁtting our observing con-
straints, we derived the fraction of explosion energy con-
verted to CRs, Ecr, and compared the simulated values
(see Table 2) with those inferred from observations. From
the analysis of Fermi data, Abdo et al. (2010) estimated
the total content of accelerated CRs as ≈ (1 − 4) × 1049
erg. A similar result has been found by Yuan et al.
(2013) who suggest that the total energy lost amounts
to ≈ 4 × 1049 erg9. In our model, Ecr increases for higher
values of η and ranges between 9 × 1049 erg (η = 10−4)
and 2.3 × 1050 erg (η = 10−3), higher than those in-
ferred from the observations. We conclude therefore that
the injection rate in Cas A should be slightly lower than
η = 10−4.

During the remnant expansion, we followed the evolu-

9 It is worth noting that Zirakashvili et al. (2014) suggest an
energy lost closer to ≈ 3 × 1050 erg in Cas A, on the base of the
results of a model describing the diﬀusive shock acceleration of
particles in the non-linear regime.

of ejecta, energy of explosion, injection rate, density of
the RSG wind, etc.), we considered those of run SN-
4M-2.3E-1ETA (see Table 2) which is one of the models
reproducing the main observing constraints10 of Cas A.
We preferred this model to the others because it predicts
a fraction of explosion energy converted to CRs that is
closer to the values inferred from observations (a factor
of ≈ 2 larger than that suggested by Abdo et al. 2010
and Yuan et al. 2013)

We explored the case of a shrapnel initially located
either within the iron core at the distance Dknot =
0.15 RSNR from the center (where RSNR ≈ 10 AU is the
initial radius of the remnant 1 day after the SN event)
or just outside the iron core at Dknot = 0.35 RSNR. In all
the cases, the shrapnel is placed at an angle of 45o with
respect to the x, y, and z-axis. The initial radius of the
shrapnel is rknot, its density and velocity are χn and χv
times larger, respectively, than those of the surrounding
ejecta at distance Dknot from the center. A summary of
the cases explored is given in Table 3.

The evolution of the shrapnel is analogous to that de-
scribed by Miceli et al. (2013), except for the interac-
tion with the surrounding small-scale clumps of ejecta
which are present in our simulations. Initially the shrap-
nel pushes out through less dense and chemically distinct
layers above, favoring the development of hydrodynamic
instabilities at its boundary which contribute to its frag-
mentation. Then the shrapnel enters in the intershock re-
gion where it is compressed, heated, and ionized. Also it
interacts with Rayleigh-Taylor and Richtmyer-Meshkov
instabilities developed at the contact discontinuity. As
a result, the shrapnel is partially eroded by the insta-
bilities and evolves towards a core-plume structure. At
this stage, its core can be signiﬁcantly denser than the
surrounding shocked ejecta, depending on the initial size
and density contrast of the knot.

Fig. 7 shows the spatial distributions of shocked Fe
(blue) and Si/S (green) at the age of Cas A, for diﬀerent
parameters of a shrapnel initially located within the iron
core (Dknot = 0.15 RSNR; see Table 3). Depending on its
initial density and velocity contrasts, the shrapnel can
produce a spatial inversion of ejecta layers, leading to the

10 Namely the observed density of the shocked wind and the

shocks.

Si/S-rich ejecta physically interior to the Fe-rich ejecta.
A similar eﬀect is observed in Cas A as, for example,
in the so-called SE Fe piston: X-ray observations show
that Fe-rich ejecta are at a greater radius than Si/S-rich
ejecta, and this has been interpreted as an overturning of
ejecta layers during the SN explosion (e.g. Hughes et al.
2000).
In our simulations, the spatial inversion occurs
because the piston is subject to hydrodynamic instabili-
ties which lead to some overturning of the layers in a way
analogous that that described by Kifonidis et al. (2006)
for the instabilities developed during a SN explosion.
The inversion is evident at t = 340 yr if the initial den-
sity contrast of the shrapnel was χn > 10 and its velocity
contrast was χv > 2.5 (see upper and middle panels of
Fig. 7). Also we found that the presence of the inversion
does not depend on the shrapnel size rknot, at least in
the range of values explored (see lower panel of Fig. 7).
This result puts a lower limit to both the density and ve-
locity contrasts of an overdense knot formed in the iron
core few hours after the SN explosion in order to produce
the spatial inversion of Fe-rich ejecta with Si-rich ejecta
observed in Cas A.

The ﬁnal distribution of shocked Si/S in the case of a
knot initially located just outside the iron core is shown
in Fig. 8.
In this case, the simulations showed that
knots with χv = 1 do not reach the remnant outline
at t = 340 yr even if their density contrast χn is up to
10 (upper left panel in Fig. 8); knots with χn = 1 can
perturb the remnant outline at t = 340 yr if χv = 10 but
without producing a collimated Si/S-rich protrusion (see
lower right panel in Fig. 8). Indeed a Si/S-rich shrapnel
can reach the remnant outline and protrude it, if the ini-
tial knot was both denser and faster than the surround-
ing medium. Knots with initial density and velocity con-
trasts larger than 1 produce Si-rich jet-like features (see
upper right and lower left panels in Fig. 8) which are
similar to the NE and SW Si-rich jets observed in Cas A.
From the simulations, we derived the amount of
shocked Fe and Si/S for the diﬀerent parameters of the
shrapnel (see Figs. 9-10). We found that the amount
of shocked Si/S at t = 340 yr is poorly aﬀected by the
initial shrapnel parameters (within the ranges explored)
and even by the initial location of the knot (either inside
or outside the iron core). The ﬁnal amount of shocked
Si/S ranges between 0.008 and 0.016M⊙. This is mainly
due to the fact that a signiﬁcant part of the Si/S shell
interacts with the reverse shock even without any initial
shrapnel, so that the contribution of the latter to the
amount of shocked Si/S is poorly relevant. On the other
hand, the mass of shocked Fe at t = 340 yr strongly de-
pends on the initial parameters of the shrapnel. In fact,
in the absence of initial anisotropies, the iron core is not
reached by the reverse shock during the ﬁrst 340 yr of
evolution (see Sect. 3.1). The shocked Fe observed in
the simulations therefore is entirely due to the shrap-
nel. We found that knots with χn > 10, χv > 2.5, and
rknot > 0.03RSNR lead up to ≈ 0.1M⊙ of shocked Fe
(see lower panel in Fig. 9). Finally it is worth noting
that signiﬁcant shocked Fe is produced only if the initial
anisotropy was located within the iron core.

3.3. Spatial distribution and chemical composition of

the Cas A ejecta

Based on the results obtained in Sect. 3.2, we searched
for the initial anisotropies that best reproduce the spa-

tial distribution of Fe and Si/S observed today in
Cas A (e.g. DeLaney et al. 2010; Hwang & Laming 2012;
Milisavljevic & Fesen 2013). As reference model, we con-
sidered the case of a progenitor MS star with 15 M⊙ and
injection rate η = 10−4 (run CAS-15MS-1ETA). The

mass of ejecta, energy of explosion, radius of progeni-
tor star, and density of the RSG wind are those of run
SN-4M-2.3E-1ETA (see Table 2). Then we explored the
space of parameters characterizing the anisotropies, by
adopting an iterative process of trial and error to con-
verge on parameters that reproduce the spatial distribu-
tion and mass of shocked Fe and Si/S inferred from ob-
servations (Hwang & Laming 2012). Table 4 reports our
best-ﬁt parameters describing the initial anisotropies.

Three of them are located within the iron core at
Dknot = 0.15 RSNR, roughly lying in a plane oriented
with an ≈ −30o rotation about the x-axis (namely the
eastwest axis in the plane of the sky) and an ≈ 25o rota-

tion about the z-axis (the northsouth axis in the plane
of the sky; see Fig. 11). The other two are located just
outside the iron core at Dknot = 0.35 RSNR on a line ori-
ented with an ≈ −67o rotation about the x-axis and an
≈ 67o rotation about the z-axis (see Fig. 11). The ﬁrst
three knots reproduce the Fe-rich regions and the others
the Si-rich NE jet and SW counterjet observed today in
Cas A. Table 4 reports also the masses and energies of
the pistons responsible for the observed distribution of
Fe and Si/S. We note that the total kinetic energy of all
the pistons is about 1.5 × 1050 erg. Thus the pistons/jets
represent a relatively small fraction (≈ 7%) of the rem-
nant’s energy budget, at odds with previous estimates
(e.g. Willingale et al. 2003; Laming et al. 2006).

We performed additional simulations to explore also
the case of a progenitor MS star with 20 M⊙ (run CAS-
20MS-1ETA) and the case in which there is no feedback
of accelerated CRs (η = 0; run CAS-15MS-0ETA). How-
ever, from the analysis of the distribution of Si, S, and Fe,
we did not ﬁnd any appreciable diﬀerence of these cases
with our reference model (run CAS-15MS-1ETA). In the
following, therefore, we discuss in detail only the results
of run CAS-15MS-1ETA, mentioning the diﬀerences (if
any) with the other two cases.

3.3.1. Shocked ejecta

In our favored model, the initial ejecta distribution (at
day ≈ 1 since the SN event) is characterized by ﬁve large-
scale spherical knots (in addition to the smaller-scale
clumpy structure). From our model, we derived the total
mass of shocked ejecta at t = 340 yr, Mej,sh ≈ 3.66 M⊙
(see Table 5). This value is larger than that inferred by
Hwang & Laming (2012) from the analysis of Chandra
observations of Cas A, namely Mej,sh ≈ 2.84 M⊙. The
latter estimate, however, has been derived by matching

the Cas A observations with 1D hydrodynamic models of
SNR evolution. We note that their best-ﬁt model con-
siders a total ejecta mass, Mej ≈ 3.14M⊙, lower than
that adopted in our simulations (Mej ≈ 4M⊙). Indeed,
considering the fraction of the total ejecta mass that is
shocked at t = 340 yr, Mej,sh/Mej, we found that the
value predicted with our model (≈ 92 %) is in agreement
with that derived by Hwang & Laming (2012) (≈ 90 %).
Fig. 11 shows the 3D spatial distribution of shocked Fe
and Si/S derived from run CAS-15MS-1ETA, considering
diﬀerent points of view. An on-line animation has been
provided that shows the 3D distribution rotated com-
pletely about the northsouth axis (Movie 1). The ejecta
morphology is dominated by the three Fe-rich regions
caused by the initial anisotropies located in the iron core
(see Table 4). We note that the SE Fe-rich region has
more a jet-like structure if compared with the other re-
gions in agreement with the observations (DeLaney et al.
2010). This is due to the higher density contrast of the
corresponding initial anisotropy (see Table 4). As ex-
pected on the base of the results of Sect. 3.2, the initial
anisotropies produce a spatial inversion of ejecta layers at
the age of Cas A, leading locally to Fe-rich ejecta placed
at a greater radius than Si/S-rich ejecta.

A striking aspect is that the Fe-rich regions are circled
by rings of Si/S-rich ejecta. In particular we can iden-
tify clearly two complete rings around the NW and SE
Fe-rich regions (see Movie 1). These features resemble
the cellular structure of [Ar II], [Ne II], and Si XIII ob-
served in Cas A that appears as rings on the surface of
a sphere (e.g. DeLaney et al. 2010). The Si/S-rich rings
form as a result of the high velocity Fe-rich ejecta pis-
tons (the shrapnels) in a way similar to that suggested
by DeLaney et al. (2010). Each piston pushes out the
chemically distinct layers above and, at some point, it
breaks through some of them, leading to the spatial in-
version of ejecta layers (see Sect. 3.2). Then the material
of the outer layers (in particular the Si/S) is swept out by
the piston and progressively accumulates at its sides. As

a result, when the piston encounters the reverse shock,
a region of shock-heated Fe forms which is enclosed by a
ring of shock-heated Si/S.

The post-explosion anisotropies located just outside

the iron core are responsible for the Si/S-rich jets (see
Fig. 11 and Movie 1). In this case the shrapnels (given
the initial values of their density and velocity contrasts)
break through the outer ejecta layers, thus not preserving

average emission-measure-weighted velocity of shocked
Fe and Si/S along the line of sight derived from our
model. The shocked Si/S is mostly concentrated in the
redshifted jet to the NE and a large redshifted ring-like
feature to the NW. The latter is the result of the piston
which breaks through the Si/S layer and is responsible
for the large Fe-rich region to the NW. These two fea-
tures are those with the highest absolute values of veloc-
ity along the line of sight, ≈ 4000 km s−1. In the case
of the NE jet (inclined with an angle of 23o with respect
to the plane of the sky), this corresponds to the high ve-
locity values of the streams of ≈ 10000 km s−1 derived
from the simulation. The SW jet and the SE piston are
visible as blueshifted material. The shocked Fe is con-
centrated in the most prominent redshifted area to the
NW and the blueshifted area to the SE. We note that
the velocity pattern of shocked Fe is remarkably simi-
lar to the Doppler images derived from observations of
Cas A (e.g. Willingale et al. 2002; DeLaney et al. 2010).
In particular it matches the approximate velocity range
inferred from observations, namely ±4000 km s−1.

From the models we calculated the masses of Fe and
Si/S in shocked ejecta at t = 340 yr (see Table 5) and
compared them with the values inferred from the anal-
ysis of Chandra observations (Hwang & Laming 2012).
We found that the models adopting the parameters of
the anisotropies summarized in Table 4 reproduce quite
well the mass of shocked Fe11. On the other hand, all
our models slightly underestimate the fraction of mass
of shocked Si/S, MSi/S,sh/Mej, by ≈ 30% (see Table 4).
This was somehow expected on the basis of the results
of Sect. 3.2. In fact, the eﬀect of the initial asymmetries
is only to slightly increase the mass of shocked Si/S with
respect to the case of a spherically symmetric explosion.
Thus a way to increase signiﬁcantly the mass of shocked
Si/S might be to change the initial isotopic composition
adopted for the ejecta. However, we found that our result
does not change either if we adopt a progenitor MS star
with 20 M⊙ (run CAS-20MS-1ETA in Table 5) or if we
neglect the eﬀects of CRs acceleration (run CAS-15MS-
0ETA). Nevertheless we note that our models as well as
the values inferred from the observations are subject to
some uncertainties, so that a discrepancy of the order of
30% may be considered satisfactory.

Fig. 13 shows the emission measure distribution as a
function of electron temperature, kTe, and ionization age,
net, for the shocked plasma at the age of Cas A. The X-
ray emitting plasma is largely out of equilibrium of ion-
ization with the emission measure distribution peaking
at kTe ≈ 2 keV and net ≈ 1011 cm−3 s in a region domi-
nated by shocked ISM (see upper panel in Fig. 13). These
values are in excellent agreement with the best-ﬁt param-
eters derived by Lee et al. (2014) from the analysis of
X-ray spectra extracted from several regions around the
outermost boundary dominated by thermal emission of
shocked ambient gas (see lower panel in Fig. 13). A more
complete comparison of our model results with observa-
tions is obtained by considering the analysis of Chandra
observations of Hwang & Laming (2012). These authors
provided a consistent spectral characterization of the en-

but this depends on the ﬁne tuning of the parameters of the asym-
metries.

locally the original onion-skin nucleosynthetic layering.
Then the shrapnels are able to protrude the remnant out-
line, thus forming wide-angle (≈ 40o) opposing streams
of Si/S-rich ejecta in the NE and SW quadrants. This is
consistent with the scenario proposed to explain the ori-
gin of the Si/S-rich NE jet and SW counterjet observed
in Cas A (e.g. Fesen et al. 2006). The streams travel
at velocities up to ≈ 10000 km s−1 in agreement with
the values inferred from the observations (Fesen 2001;
Hwang et al. 2004; Fesen & Milisavljevic 2015).

tire remnant of Cas A by deﬁning a grid of macropixels
across the remnant and analyzing every spectrum in the
grid. In such a way, they were able to derive the distri-
butions of ionization ages and electron temperatures of
the entire remnant. We found that our simulation pre-
dicts kTe and net values in the observed ranges. The
distributions of kTe and net derived from the simula-
tion are highly peaked in agreement with the ﬁndings of

Hwang & Laming (2012) who suggested that the peaked
distributions result from the multiple secondary shocks
following reverse shock interaction with ejecta inhomo-
geneities. Fig. 13 shows also that the shocked Fe is at an
advanced ionization age (net ≈ 1012 cm−3 s) relative to
the other elements. This is also in nice agreement with
the observations (e.g. Hwang & Laming 2003, 2012).

3.3.2. Unshocked ejecta

In our model, the total mass of unshocked ejecta
at the age of Cas A is ≈ 0.34 M⊙. This value is
in good agreement with that inferred from the analy-
sis of low frequency (< 100 MHz) radio observations
(≈ 0.39 M⊙; DeLaney et al. 2014) and that derived by
Hwang & Laming (2012) by interpreting the Chandra ob-
servations with hydrodynamic models (≈ 0.30 M⊙).

The 3D spatial distributions of unshocked Fe and Si/S
are reported in Fig. 14. An on-line animation shows the
3D distribution rotated completely about the northsouth
axis (Movie 2). The majority of the unshocked Si/S
follows roughly the original onion-skin nucleosynthetic
layering. However, the original Si/S layer is character-
ized by ﬁve large cavities corresponding to the direc-
tions of propagation of the post-explosion anisotropies
(pistons/jets). The regions of shocked Fe observed in
the main-shell and the NE and SW jets are located ex-
actly above the cavities. We also found that the cav-
ities are physically connected to some of the rings of
shocked Si/S in the main-shell as, for instance, in the
case of the NW and SE cavities (compare Figs. 11 and
14, and Movies 1 and 2). The average structure of the
unshocked Si/S is somehow reminiscent of the bubble-
like morphology characterizing the remnant interior of
Cas A, inferred from the analysis of near-infrared spec-
tra of the remnant including the [S III] 906.9 and 953.1
nm (Milisavljevic & Fesen 2015).

The Fe-rich NW and SE pistons are responsible for the
largest cavities in our simulations, with the NW cavity
with a radius of ≈ 0.88 pc and the SE cavity with a radius
of ≈ 0.54 pc. These values are also in good agreement
with those estimated from the analysis of observations
(Milisavljevic & Fesen 2015). On the other hand, the
distribution of unshocked S derived from the analysis of
near-infrared spectra appears much more structured than
in our simulations. This may suggest that a number of
smaller-scale pistons with lower velocity and/or density
contrast (not considered in our simulations) might be
present in Cas A.

The structure of Si/S is ﬁlled by unshocked Fe (see
Fig. 14 and Movie 2) with a density below 0.1 cm−3.
Most of the Fe is concentrated in the remnant core and
shows a clumpy structure in agreement with the expec-
tation of strong instabilities associated with the explo-
sion reverse shock during the ﬁrst few hours after the SN
explosion. The distribution of Fe is roughly spherically
symmetric, although large cavities are evident which cor-
respond to the regions of the initial pistons. The to-
tal mass of unshocked Fe derived from the model
is
≈ 0.1 M⊙.

Our model predicts a low-density and low-temperature
environment in the unshocked ejecta. The average
density derived from the simulation is ρ ≈ 2 ×
10−24 g cm−3. From the analysis of radio observa-
tions of Cas A, DeLaney et al. (2014) derive a density

ρ ≈ 5.5 × 10−24 g cm−3, assuming a uniform density
ejecta distribution throughout the remnant interior with
no clumping. The hydrodynamic models considered by
Hwang & Laming (2012) to interpret the Chandra obser-
vations of Cas A predict a density ρ ≈ 1 × 10−24 g cm−3
at an age of 330 yr. The temperature of the unshocked
ejecta is rather low due to the rapid expansion of the SNR
and ranges between ≈ 10 K (close to the origin of the SN
explosion) and ≈ 103 K (immediately before the reverse
shock). These temperatures are consistent with the anal-
ysis of the Spitzer infrared data (e.g. Eriksen et al. 2009)
and with the evidence that unshocked dust temperatures
of about 35 K are observed in the infrared band (e.g.
Nozawa et al. 2010).

wind of the progenitor RSG, thus covering the evolution
of the system from few seconds after the SN event till
the current age of the remnant (t = 340 yr). The model
includes the eﬀects on shock dynamics due to back-
reaction of accelerated cosmic rays and describes the ini-
tial structure of the ejecta through small-scale clump-
ing of material and larger-scale anisotropies, according to
indications from theoretical studies (e.g. Li et al. 1993;
Wang et al. 2002; Kifonidis et al. 2006; Wang & Wheeler
2008; Gawryszczak et al. 2010, and references therein).
The model follows the evolution of the post-explosion
isotopic composition of the ejecta in order to trace the
distribution of Si, S, and Fe, namely the elements charac-
terizing most of the anisotropies (e.g. jets, pistons) iden-
tiﬁed in the morphology of Cas A (e.g. DeLaney et al.
2010; Milisavljevic & Fesen 2013).

4. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We studied the evolution of ejecta in the SNR Cas A
with the aim to investigate the origin of the asymme-
tries observed today in its morphology.
In particular,
we investigated the scenario of high velocity pistons
of ejecta emerging from the SN explosion proposed by
DeLaney et al. (2010) to explain the distribution of Fe-
rich regions and Si-rich jets observed today in Cas A. To
this end, we developed a hydrodynamic model describing
the evolution of Cas A from the immediate aftermath of
the SN explosion to the remnant expansion through the

We explored the parameter space of the model search-
ing for the values of ejecta mass, Mej, and explosion
energy, ESN, best reproducing the radii and velocities
of the forward and reverse shocks as observed at the
current time (t = 340 yr), and the density of the
shocked RSG wind inferred from observations. The best
match was found for models with Mej ≈ 4M⊙ and
ESN ≈ 2.3 × 1051 erg. These values are in good agree-
ment with those estimated from the analysis of observa-
tions (Laming & Hwang 2003; Hwang & Laming 2003;

Young et al. 2006). It is worth noting that, in our simu-
lations, the envelope mass, Mej, was ﬁxed equal to 4M⊙
(according to Young et al. 2006 and van Veelen et al.
2009) in order to reduce the computational cost in the
exploration of the parameter space. On the other hand,
an envelope mass of ≈ 3 − 5 M⊙ would not considerably
deviate from the observations. We expect that, adopt-
ing lower values of Mej, the explosion energy ESN re-
quired to ﬁt our observational constraints would be larger
than that found here12. The opposite is expected for
higher values of Mej. On the other hand, the explo-
sion energy that we found for Mej ≈ 4M⊙ is very close
to that inferred from the observations (≈ 2 × 1051 erg;
Laming & Hwang 2003; Hwang & Laming 2003), so that
we are conﬁdent that the envelope mass adopted here is
not far away from the true value. Our best-ﬁt models
also predict that the radius of the progenitor RSG at the
explosion was R0 ≈ 300 − 400 R⊙.
It is interesting to
note that this value is compatible with a RSG that has
lost a signiﬁcant fraction of its H-rich envelope before the
SN event (e.g. Bersten et al. 2012).

The evidence of non-thermal emission in Cas A sug-
gests that eﬀective acceleration of CRs occurs at the
shock fronts. Thus we investigated the eﬀects of back-
reaction of accelerated CRs on the shock dynamics for
diﬀerent injection rates η. We found that the fraction of
explosion energy converted to CRs at the current epoch
increases with η and ranges between ≈ 9 × 1049 erg
(η = 10−4) and ≈ 2.3 × 1050 erg (η = 10−3). These val-
ues are larger than those inferred from the observations
(namely ≈ 4 × 1049 erg; Abdo et al. 2010; Yuan et al.
2013), suggesting that the injection rate in Cas A is
η < 10−4. Since the plasma compressibility increases in
the presence of CR acceleration, a less dense RSG wind
is needed to ﬁt the observed radii and velocities of the
forward and reverse shocks. In the case of a very eﬃcient
CR acceleration (η = 10−3), our model predicts a wind
density nw ∼ 0.4 cm−3 at r ≈ 2.5 pc, suggesting that
the swept-up mass of the RSG wind is Mw,sh ≈ 3M⊙
(see Eq. 1). Note that the value Mw,sh ≈ 6M⊙ derived
in Sect. 2.1 for negligible CR acceleration is an upper
limit to the shocked mass of the wind.

It is interesting to note that models with diﬀerent η
required the same explosion energy to ﬁt our observa-
tional constraints, despite the amount of energy lost in
CRs acceleration is larger for higher values of η. This
is explained because a lower density of the RSG wind
was required to ﬁt the observed density of the shocked
wind. In fact, on one hand, the energy lost produces a
slowdown and, on the other hand, the lower wind density
produces a speedup of the forward shock. We found that
the two eﬀects cancel out each other in our simulations,
so that the same explosion energy is required for diﬀerent
values of η.

We investigated the eﬀects that high-velocity pistons
emerging from the SN explosion have on the ﬁnal rem-
nant morphology. In particular, we explored the param-
eter space of the initial pistons with the aim to reproduce
the spatial distribution and the masses of shocked Fe and
Si/S inferred from the observations of Cas A. For this ex-

12 For instance, Chevalier & Oishi (2003) found an explosion
energy ESN ≈ 4 × 1051 erg with an ejecta mass of Mej = 3.2 M⊙.

ploration, we considered the initial size of the shrapnels
and their contrasts of density and velocity with respect
to the surrounding ejecta. Since the physical quantities
characterizing the shrapnels are set relatively to the sur-
rounding medium, we do not expect signiﬁcant changes
in our results if diﬀerent total mass of ejecta (which af-
fects their density) and/or explosion energy (aﬀecting the
density and velocity of ejecta) were adopted in the simu-
lations. In all the cases explored we found that the initial
shrapnels are gradually fragmented into smaller clumps
as the remnant evolves. In particular this happens when
the shrapnels are compressed and heated by the reverse
shock arising from the interaction of the remnant with
the RSG wind.

The model best matching the observations predicts
that, at least, ﬁve large-scale anisotropies have developed
in the immediate aftermath of the SN explosion. Three of
them were located within the iron core and reproduce the
Fe-rich regions observed today in Cas A. The other two
were located just outside the iron core and reproduce the
Si-rich NE jet and SW counterjet. The parameters char-
acterizing these anisotropies (namely their initial size,
and the velocity and density contrasts) are consistent
with those found through multi-dimensional modeling of
SN explosions for the dense knots produced by Rayleigh-
Taylor instabilities seeded by ﬂow structures resulting
from neutrino-driven convection (e.g. Kifonidis et al.
2003; Ellinger et al. 2012). We determined the energies
and masses of the initial anisotropies and found that they
had a total mass of ≈ 0.25 M⊙ and a total kinetic energy
of ≈ 1.5 × 1050 erg, thus representing a small fraction of
the total ejecta mass (≈ 5%) and of the remnant’s energy
budget (≈ 7%).

We note that our simulations predict that the initial
pistons were faster than the surrounding ejecta. Interest-
ingly, Wongwathanarat et al. (2015), through 3D model-
ing of core-collapse SNe, have found that SN explosions
from RSG progenitors with 15 M⊙ (at variance with SNe
from blue supergiant progenitors) present a large devel-
opment of fast plumes of Ni-rich ejecta which grow into
extended ﬁngers from which fast metal-rich clumps de-
tach. This leads to a global metal asymmetry character-
ized by pronounced clumpiness, and a deep penetration
of Ni ﬁngers into the overlying layers of ejecta.

In regions not aﬀected by large-scale anisotropies, the
average chemical stratiﬁcation of the ejecta few days af-
ter the SN event is roughly maintained in the subsequent
evolution until the current age of Cas A. Thus, although
the rapid ejecta expansion is certainly not homologous
because clumps and instabilities may easily develop (e.g.
Wang & Chevalier 2001; Orlando et al. 2012), our model
suggests that the abundance pattern observed in young
SNRs keeps memory of the radial distribution of heavy
elements in the aftermath of the explosion in regions not
aﬀected by the large-scale anisotropies developed during
the SN event. This result explains the evidence that, ap-
parently, the onion-skin nucleosynthetic layering of the
SN has been preserved in some regions of Cas A (e.g.
Fesen et al. 2006; DeLaney et al. 2010), namely those
not aﬀected by the initial pistons.

On the other hand, the chemical stratiﬁcation is not
preserved in regions strongly aﬀected by the pistons/jets
propagation. The pistons responsible for Si/S-rich jets
break through the outer ejecta layers, protruding the

18

remnant outline and forming opposing streams of Si/S-
rich ejecta in the NE and SW quadrants. The Fe-rich
pistons produce a spatial inversion of ejecta layers, lead-
ing to the Si/S-rich ejecta physically interior to the Fe-
rich ejecta. In fact, each piston is subject to hydrody-
namic instabilities during its propagation and this lead to
some overturning of the chemical layers. Again, this re-
sult matches nicely with the evidence that Fe-rich ejecta
are at a greater radius than Si/S-rich ejecta in the Fe-
rich regions of shocked ejecta observed in Cas A (e.g.
Hughes et al. 2000).

A striking feature is that the regions of Fe-rich shocked
ejecta are circled by rings of Si/S-rich shocked ejecta.
These rings are the result of the dynamics of high-
velocity pistons emerging from the SN explosion. As a
snowplow, each piston pushes the layers above to the
side, causing a progressive accumulation of chemically
distinct material (in particular Si/S) around the piston
itself. As a result, when the piston encounters the re-
verse shock, a central region of shocked Fe circled by a
ring enriched of shocked Si/S forms. An example is the
region of Fe-rich shocked ejecta to the NW (see Fig. 11
and Movie 1).

The modeled rings are consistent with the bright
rings of [Ar II], [Ne II], and Si XIII around the Fe-
rich regions observed in Cas A (e.g. Morse et al. 2004;
Patnaude & Fesen 2007; DeLaney et al. 2010). Thus
our model provides evidence that high-velocity pistons
emerging from the SN explosion may explain the ori-
gin of the bright rings observed in Cas A, supporting the
original scenario proposed by DeLaney et al. (2010). We
note however that the observed rings are much more pro-
nounced than those in our simulations. A role might be
played by the magnetic ﬁeld which is neglected in our
model. If the ejecta are magnetized, the clumps are ex-
pected to be preserved and longer-living because the ﬁeld
would envelope the ejecta clumps, limiting the growth of
hydrodynamic instabilities contributing to their fragmen-
tation (e.g. Orlando et al. 2012). As a result, the clumps
of chemically distinct material pushed to the side of the
pistons might survive for a longer time, producing more
evident and brighter rings.

A further support to the scenario of high-velocity pis-
tons comes from the analysis of the deviations from equi-
librium of ionization of shocked plasma. Our simulations
predict that the shocked Fe is at an advanced ioniza-
tion age (net ≈ 1012 cm−3 s) relative to the other ele-
ments, in excellent agreement with Chandra observations
of Cas A (e.g. Hwang & Laming 2012).
It is interest-
ing to note that the evidence of an advanced ionization
age of shocked Fe is considered as an argument against
the origin of Fe-rich regions from expanding plumes of
radioactive 56Ni-rich ejecta which predicts much lower
ionization ages (e.g. Li et al. 1993; Blondin et al. 2001;
Milisavljevic & Fesen 2015).

Finally we analyzed also the distribution of unshocked
ejecta and found that our model reproduces the main
features observed in the radio and near-infrared bands.
The distribution of unshocked Si/S is characterized by
large cavities corresponding to the directions of propa-
gation of the pistons/jets. This explains why the cav-
ities observed in near-infrared observations are physi-
cally connected to the bright rings in the main-shell (e.g.
Milisavljevic & Fesen 2015). Our model predicts that the
structure of Si/S is ﬁlled by low-density unshocked Fe.
We estimated a total mass of unshocked Fe of ≈ 0.1 M⊙.
