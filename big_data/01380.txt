Abstract

It is by now established that neutrino oscillations occur due to non-zero masses and pa-
rameters in the leptonic mixing matrix. The extraction of oscillation parameters may be
complicated due to subleading eﬀects such as non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI)
and one needs to have a fresh look how a particular parameter value is inferred from ex-
perimental data. In the present work, we focus on an important parameter entering the
oscillation framework - the leptonic CP violating phase δ, about which we know very little.
We demonstrate that the sensitivity to CP violation gets signiﬁcantly impacted due to NSI
eﬀects for the upcoming long baseline experiment, Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment
(DUNE). We also draw a comparison with the sensitivities of other ongoing neutrino beam
experiments such as NOvA and T2K as well as a future generation experiment, T2HK.

1 Introduction

The discovery of neutrino oscillations implies that neutrinos have masses and mix among
three active ﬂavours. If neutrinos have masses then the leptonic charged current interactions
exhibit mixing and CP violation in much the same way as in the quark sector [1,2]. Within
the Standard Model (SM), CP violation arises naturally via the Dirac phase, δ in the three
ﬂavour case as concocted by Kobayashi and Maskawa [3]. It was suggested [4, 5], that a
measurement of δ was possible through neutrino oscillations. The value of δ could very
well be zero, maximal (δ ∼ ±π/2) or non-maximal (δ (cid:54)= ±π/2) [6]. The extraction of the
value of CP phase is plagued with the matter-induced fake CP violating eﬀects which makes
its measurement very challenging even in the case of SM [7, 8]. Additionally, we need to
know the ordering of the neutrino masses and also the octant of θ23 in order to have a clear
understanding of the mixing phenomena.
Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is one of the most promising upcoming
long baseline experiments that is planned to oﬀer maximal sensitivity to uncover the value of
δ [9–13]. The baseline of 1300 km is expected to deliver optimal sensitivity to CP violation
and is well-suited to address the question of neutrino mass hierarchy [14]. Sensitivity studies
leading to optimal conﬁgurations have been carried out for DUNE stand alone as well as
in conjunction with other long baseline experiments and atmospheric neutrinos and it was
shown that the CP violation can be established for ∼ 80% of the CP phase values [15, 16]
under favourable conditions. Of course, all these studies assume the SM where the only
source of CP violation is the Dirac CP phase. Other interesting proposals to look for leptonic
CP violation include the proposed Tokai to HyperKamiokande (T2HK) experiment [17]
and MuOn-decay MEdium baseline NeuTrino beam (MOMENT) experiment which exploits
neutrinos from muon decay [18].

Since there are clear hints of existence of new physics beyond the SM, it is likely that the
SM does not provide a complete description of CP violation in nature. A particular new
physics scenario would introduce additional sources of CP violating eﬀects in addition to
the lone CP violating source (δ) of the SM (see [19, 20] for models giving rise to NSI) and
this could change the relationship of measured quantities to the CP violating parameter
of the SM [21]. In presence of new physics, we need to reassess the conclusions drawn in
connection to CP violation. This was discussed in the context of Neutrino Factory in [22]
(see also [23] in context of atmospheric neutrinos) which led to the conclusion that a new
physics eﬀect might be mis-interpreted as the canonical Dirac CP violation or vice-versa.
Concerning the value of the CP phase δ, there was a mild hint of its value from the global
analyses of neutrino data [24] and in recent years, the T2K [25], NOvA [26] as well as
SK atmospheric events [27] indicate nearly maximal value (δ ∼ −π/2) for the CP phase
although presently the signiﬁcance of this result is below 3σ. If the signiﬁcance improves
in future, it is very important to rule out alternative mechanisms such as NSI [28] (also see
Ref. [29] for a review and references therein) or CPT violation [30, 31] or additional sterile
neutrinos (see [32, 33]) that could very well be consistent with data.

In a recent work [34] (see also [28, 35–39]), we studied the impact of non-standard inter-
actions (NSI) during propagation on CP measurements at long baselines using DUNE as
an example. We discussed the role of individual and collective NSI parameters on the CP
measurements. We restricted ourselves to a discussion of CP asymmetries using solely the

1

probability for the electron appearance channel Pµe and showed how NSI eﬀects translate
at the level of event rates. Since then there has been a lot of activity [28, 35–39] in this
direction exploring eﬀects due to propagation NSI at long baselines. In [35], the goal was to
discuss possible improvement of bounds on the NSI parameters using diﬀerent channels at
long baseline experiments. In [36] the correlation between diﬀerent SI and NSI parameters
and ways to distinguish scenarios of new physics (sterile neutrinos versus NSI) compared to
the standard case was discussed. In [37], it was shown that new degeneracies in presence
of NSI at long baselines can arise which complicate the determination of mass hierarchy,
CP violation and octant of θ23. Ref. [38] deals with constraining NSI parameters using long
baseline experiments. Very recently, it has been suggested that the proposed MOMENT
experiment due to its much smaller baseline may prove helpful in solving the degeneracies
due to NSI leading to unambiguous determination of CP violation [39].
While sensitivity studies have been carried out in presence of NSI in the context of DUNE,
we would like to stress that none of them deal with the precise impact of NSI on the sensi-
tivity to CP violation at long baseline experiments. We consider NSI terms whose strengths
lie in the presently allowed limits (along with the phases associated with these terms which
are presently unconstrained) and study the impact of individual and collective NSI terms
on the the CP violation sensitivity using diﬀerent channels. We assess in a comprehensive
manner the sensitivity to CP violation oﬀered by present and future generation long baseline
experiments : T2K , NOvA , DUNE and T2HK when the NSI eﬀects are turned on.

The paper is organised as follows. Sec. 2 gives the framework for the present work. Sec 2.1
comprises of a brief introduction to NSI in propagation and how the genuine and fake CP
violating eﬀects can arise due to NC NSI terms which are constrained. We then discuss
the CP dependence of the probabilities Pµe and Pµµ in Sec. 2.2. In Sec. 2.3, we give our
analysis procedure using the CP dependence of probabilities in Sec. 2.2. We then go on to
describe our results in Sec. 3 where we show how CP sensitivity at DUNE gets aﬀected
due to individual and collective NSI terms (Sec. 3.1). We also show dependence on true
values of standard oscillation parameters in Sec. 3.2 and compare the results obtained at
DUNE with other long baseline experiments in Sec. 3.3. The impact of NSI on the CP
fraction is shown as a function of exposure and baseline in Sec. 3.4 and 3.5. We conclude
with a discussion in Sec. 4.

2 Framework

2.1 Genuine and fake CP violation due to Earth matter eﬀects - SI and NSI

It is well-known that the three neutrino ﬂavor states can be mapped to a three-level quantum
system with distinct energy eigenvalues, Ei = p + m2
i /2p in the ultrarelativistic limit in
vacuum along with the assumption of equal ﬁxed momenta (or energy). In the presence of
matter, the relativistic dispersion relation Ei = f (p, mi) gets modiﬁed due to the neutrino
matter interactions during propagation. In presence of NSI, the propagation of neutrinos
is governed by an eﬀective Schr¨odinger equation where the eﬀective Hamiltonian in ﬂavour
basis as

Hf = Hv + HSI + HNSI

If neutrinos are Majorana particles, there can be two
additional Majorana-type phases in the three ﬂavour case but they are of no consequence
in neutrino oscillations. For the SI case, we note that there is only one parameter, the
Dirac CP phase δ that is responsible for genuine CP violation while SI with Earth matter
introduces additional fake CP eﬀects due to the fact that matter is CP asymmetric. This
makes it challenging to isolate the value of genuine CP violating phase δ in SI case from the
fake eﬀects and there are several suggestions to tackle the problem [7, 8].
For the NSI case, the εαβ (≡ |εαβ| eiφαβ ) are complex NSI parameters which appear in HN SI.
The diagonal NSI parameters are real due to the hermiticity of the Hamiltonian. In total,
there are four phases appearing in the Hf - one is δ and the other three are ϕeµ, ϕeτ , ϕµτ .
The total number of phases is four due to the fact that once we have redeﬁned the phases
of the lepton and neutrino wavefunctions to get U in form Eq. 4 the basis of neutrino ﬂavor
states in deﬁned fully. The matrix that diagonalizes the NSI part of the Hamiltonian then
would require three angles and six phases out of which three are Majorana type and appear
as diagonal matrix. So, we are left with three additional phases that are relevant for us. It
may be further possible to reduce the number of phases in the limiting cases such as when
21 → 0 or θ12 → 0 as a consequence of the phase reduction theorem of Kikuchi et al. [41].

We note that E = 1.5 GeV, L = 810 km for NOvA and E = 0.6 GeV, L = 295 km for
T2K (and also T2HK) also lead to λL ∼ π. Also, rAL ∼ O(1) for the range of the E and
L values considered here.

It is interesting to note that matter (or propagation) NSI obey unitarity (while source and
detector NSI do not) so eﬀectively we still have an overall unitary matrix that diagonalises
the eﬀective Hamiltonian in presence of matter NSI and obeys

2.2 CP phase dependence in Pµe and Pµµ
We consider appearance (νµ → νe) and disappearance (νµ → νµ) channels that are relevant
in the context of accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiments considered in the present
work. Rather than delving into the detailed expressions, we note that [8, 42, 43] that the
oscillation probabilities for diﬀerent channels can be expressed in terms of the CP-even and
CP-odd terms both in case of vacuum and matter with SI 2 as

1. νµ → νe and ¯νµ → ¯νe :

Pµe = aµe + bµe sin δ + cµe cos δ
P¯µ¯e = ¯aµe − ¯bµe sin δ + ¯cµe cos δ

(9)
δ → −δ for antineutrinos and the coeﬃcients can be found in Ref. [43]. Thus, Pµe
contains linear polynomials of sin δ and cos δ.

2. νµ → νµ and ¯νµ → ¯νµ :

Pµµ (cid:39) aµµ + cµµ cos δ
P¯µ¯µ (cid:39) ¯aµµ + ¯cµµ cos δ

of oﬀ-diagonal (diagonal) NSI parameters. The NSI phases φeµ and φeτ are set to zero.

where the sin δ term is absent in this case. In addition to the linear polynomials of
cos δ in this case, there are quadratic terms such as cos 2δ (and sin 2δ) in Pµµ for the
case of constant or symmetric (asymmetric) matter density proﬁle, but the coeﬃcient
of such terms are small in comparison to aµµ and cµµ which is why we do not explicitly
mention those here. For antineutrinos, δ → −δ and the coeﬃcients in vacuum and
normal matter can be found in Ref. [43].

It is interesting to note that in presence of matter with SI, the form of Eqs. 9-10 remain
intact with the coeﬃcients suitably redeﬁned to account for their dependence on density of
Earth matter. The CP odd and even terms in Eq. 9 and 10 serve as useful guide to measure
eﬀects due to CP violation.

Let us now discuss the case of NSI which is diﬀerent from SI in the sense that it not only
introduces SI matter-like fake CP violating eﬀects arising from the moduli of the NSI terms
but also additional genuine CP phases over and above SI phase (δ). Of course, the genuine
and fake CP violating eﬀects are inter-related. The argument of Kimura et al. [42, 43] was
generalised to the case of NSI [44, 45]. In [44] (for non-zero values of εeτ , εee, ετ τ ), it was
shown that the CP dependence of probability given by Eq. 9 and 10 remains intact even in
presence of NSI as long as we make appropriate replacement for the eﬀective CP violating
phase, δ → ˆδ.
In Fig. 1, the impact of individual NSI terms on Pµe and Pµµ is shown for the baseline
corresponding to DUNE (L = 1300 km) at a ﬁxed value of energy E = 2.5 GeV. A striking
feature can be clearly seen if we compare the nature of plots on left side versus the right
side. We can simplify Eq. 9 to

Pµe = aµe − x(cid:48)
= aµe + x(cid:48)

µe sin λL/2 sin δ + x(cid:48)
µe cos(λL/2 + δ)

µe can be found in Ref. [46] for SI. We note that the (ﬁrst) peak condition for Pµe
is given by λL/2 (cid:39) π/2 and therefore for a given δ, the peak (dip) of Pµe is shifted by
an amount π/2 w.r.t. Pµµ (see Eq. 10 and 11). For SI, Eq. 9 leads to Pµe(0) = aµe + cµe
and Pµe(±π) = aµe − cµe. From the plot, we see that Pµe(0) ∼ Pµe(±π) and this implies
that cµe (cid:39) 0. Note also that the maxima/minima will be at δ = ±π/2 from Eq. 9.
If
we keep the relevant NSI phases to zero, the dashed (dotted) curves corresponding to NSI
can go on either side of the solid curve for SI. For SI, Eq. 10 leads to Pµµ(0) = aµµ + cµµ
and Pµµ(±π) = aµµ − cµµ. Note also that the maxima/minima will be at δ = 0 or π from
Eq. 10. For the diagonal parameter εee, for both Pµe and Pµµ, the eﬀect is like a uniform
enhancement (reduction) of the probability values from the SI case depending upon the sign
of εee.
In Fig. 2, the collective impact of NSI terms is shown for three diﬀerent experiments at
diﬀerent ﬁxed energies relevant to those experiments. The largest eﬀect of NSI terms can
be seen for Pµe and for DUNE and it diminishes as we go to T2K. For Pµµ, the eﬀect is
similar for all the three experiments so the baseline does not seem to play much role here.

2.3 Analysis procedure

In order to obtain the sensitivity to CP violation we need to ask the following question - what
is the sensitivity with which a particular experiment can discriminate between CP conserving
(0, π) and CP violating values ((cid:54)= 0, π) of the Dirac CP phase δ. In the standard scenario,
there is only one CP phase in the neutrino oscillation formalism. However when we consider
NSI, naturally more parameters in the form of moduli and phases of NSI parameters enter
the oscillation formalism which lead to genuine and fake CP violating eﬀects as described
above.

The NSI parameters are expressed in terms of moduli, |ε| ≡ {|εαβ|; α, β = e, µ, τ} and
phases, ϕ ≡ {ϕαβ; α, β = e, µ, τ}. The marginalisation range of NSI parameters (|ε| range
and ϕ) and SI parameters (δ) is given in Table 1. To determine the χ2 that represents a
particular experiment’s sensitivity to the presence of CP violating eﬀects, the test value
of phases (δ, ϕeµ, ϕeτ ) is assumed to be 0 or π and the χ2 for any true value of phase
(δ, ϕeµ, ϕeτ ) in the full range of [−π, π] is computed4. While the variation corresponding to
the true value of δ is depicted along the x−axis, the variation of the true values of ϕeµ, ϕeτ
(with in the allowed range) lead to the vertical width of the grey bands which show the
maximum variation in the χ2 for each value of δ (true)5.

We do not marginalise over the standard oscillation parameters except δ whose true value
is unknown. As we are investigating the role of NSI in the present study, we marginalize
over the allowed range of moduli and phases of the relevant NSI parameters. Our choice of
range of NSI parameters is consistent with the existing constraints (Eq. 8).
The indices i, j correspond to energy bins (i = 1 → x, the number of bins depends upon

4δ, ϕeµ, ϕeτ can take 0, π and there there are eight possibilities for CP conservation in NSI case as opposed

to two in SI case.

GeV, for T2K and T2HK, there are x = 20 bins of width 40 MeV in 0.4 − 1.2 GeV, for
NOvA, there are x = 28 bins of width 125 MeV in 0.5 − 4 GeV) and the type of neutrinos
i.e. neutrino or antineutrino (j = 1 → 2). As one would expect, the discovery potential of
a given experiment vanishes for the CP conserving case (δ, ϕ = 0 or π). At the values of
δ corresponding to maximum CP violation i.e. δ = ±π/2, the discovery potential reaches
a maximum. So, there is a double peak structure in the sensitivity plot. This can also be
understood from the probability curves for SI in Figs. 1-2. The appearance probability has
a maxima and minima at δ = ±π/2.
For sake of clarity, we have retained only statistical eﬀects and ignored systematic uncer-
tainities and priors in the above expression (see [16] for the full expression of χ2 including
systematics and priors). However, in our analysis, we have marginalised over systematic un-
certainities (see Table 2) but assumed that the standard oscillation parameters are known
with inﬁnite precision i.e. we have not included any priors.

The theoretically expected diﬀerential event rate is given by [10],

where Ntarget is the number of target nucleons per kiloton of detector ﬁducial volume,
Ntarget = 6.022× 1032 N/kt. Pµe(E, L) is the appearance probability for νµ → νe in matter,
Φνµ(E, L) is the ﬂux of νµ, σνe(E) is the charged current (CC) cross section of νe given by

For the disappearance channel, Pµe is to be replaced by Pµµ and σνe → σνµ. Note that
σνµ ∼ σνe for the considered energy range. For antineutrinos, νµ → ¯νµ and νe → ¯νe and
Pµe → ¯Pµe.

In order to quantify the eﬀects due to CP violation, another quantity called CP fraction
f (σ > 3) is often used. This refers to the fraction of δ values for which CP violation can be
determined above a particular value of signiﬁcance (here, 3σ). Being a fraction, f (σ > 3)
naturally lies between 0 and 1.

All the plots presented in this paper are obtained by using General Long baseline Experiment
Simulator (GLoBES) and related software [49–52] which numerically solves the full three
ﬂavour neutrino propagation equations using the PREM [53] density proﬁle of the Earth7,
and the latest values of the neutrino parameters as obtained from global ﬁts [24, 55, 56].
Unless stated otherwise, we assume NH as the true hierarchy in all the plots.

3 Results

3.1 CP sensitivity : impact of individual and collective NSI terms at DUNE

In order to clearly understand the impact of the NSI terms, we ﬁrst take only one parameter
non-zero at a time. We show the eﬀect of that particular parameter on CP sensitivity in
the appearance (νµ → νe) as well as the disappearance (νµ → νµ) channels. We also show
the case with the two channels combined.

Before we describe the impact of a particular NSI parameter (i.e.
εeµ) we would like to
point out that there are two eﬀects responsible for altering the value of the χ2 which compete
with each other :

(a) Decrease in χ2 due to additional test values - NSI introduces more number of param-
eters in the sensitivity analysis. If marginalization is carried out over more number
of test parameters, it results in a decreased value of χ2. This is purely a statistical
eﬀect.

7We use the matter density as given by PREM model. In principle, we can allow for uncertainity in the

Earth matter density in our calculations but it would not impact our results drastically [54].

Figure 3: The impact of εeµ on the signiﬁcance with which the CP violation can be determined as a
function of the value of δ at DUNE for an exposure of 350 kt.MW.yr assuming NH. The solid black curve
represents the sensitivity for our reference design. Both the moduli and phases are varied as mentioned in
the legend. The appearance and disappearance channels are shown separately and the sensitivity obtained
by combining both the channels is also shown in the last column.

(b) Increase in χ2 due to additional true values - In presence of NSI there are more sources
of CP violation. Due to inclusion of these additional fake (moduli of NSI terms) and
genuine (phase of NSI terms) CP violating parameters we have more number of true
values and this tends to increase the value of χ2 provided the strength of such terms
is large.

In Fig. 3, we show the sensitivity to CP violation by exploiting appearance and disap-
pearance channels (in isolation and combined) for the oﬀ-diagonal NSI parameter, εeµ and
compare it with the sensitivity obtained in case of SI as a benchmark. The 3σ (5σ) value is
shown as horizontal green dashed (solid) line to serve as a reference. Let us ﬁrst describe
the SI case (shown as solid black curves). The Pµe channel dominates the sensitivity of
CP violation which can be understood from the presence of CP odd term. The mild CP
sensitivity of the Pµµ (due to the presence of CP even terms and absence of CP odd terms
in Pµµ) is not useful when considered in isolation but improves the χ2 in the combined case.
The maximum (minimum) sensitivity in case of SI is attained when δ (cid:39) ±π/2 (δ = 0,±π).
In presence of NSI, in general the maximum χ2 is shifted from the SI maximum, δ = ±π/2.
This is due to the shift in the position of peaks and dips from the SI curve at the level of
probability as mentioned in Sec. 2.2.

In Pµe, the presence of additional CP odd (sin δ - like) terms in presence of NSI makes it
possible for the eﬀect (b) to overtake (a) if the value of the NSI parameter is large enough.
If we see the top row of Fig. 3, the NSI parameter is small (|εeµ| = 0.01) and the black
dashed curve (|εeµ| (cid:54)= 0) and the grey band (|εeµ| (cid:54)= 0, ϕeµ varying) are always below the SI
case due to (a) above. But for |εeµ| = 0.07, we note that the NSI (with |εeµ| (cid:54)= 0) overtakes

SI due to (b) above. Also, the grey band spreads around the SI curve. The most surprising
outcome is that there can be ≥ 3σ sensitivity to CP violation even when δ = 0,±π (SI, CP
conservation) for some (un)favourable choice of NSI moduli and phases. We can see this in
the bottom panel of left and right plot of Fig. 3. As can be seen from the middle plots in
the top and bottom rows of Fig. 3 corresponding to Pµµ, such an overtaking is not possible
due to the absence of CP odd terms (unless CPT is violated) which forbids (b) to overtake
(a) and there is always a net reduction in χ2 due to (a) even if the NSI parameter is large.

In Fig. 4, the combined (appearance + disappearance) sensitivity to CP violation is shown
both for SI and when the NSI parameter εeτ is incorporated. The eﬀects are comparable in
strength and similar in nature to that of εeµ described above. The impact of the oﬀ-diagonal
NSI parameter εµτ on the CP sensitivity is found to be negligible even if we choose values
close to the upper limit mentioned in Eq. 8 and hence is not shown here.

Having described the eﬀect of oﬀ-diagonal NSI terms, we now address the impact of the
diagonal ones - εee, εµµ, ετ τ . We show the impact of the three diagonal NSI parameters (εee,
εµµ and ετ τ ) in Fig. 5. The eﬀect of εµµ is very small as it is the most constrained parameter
(Eq. 8). For the choice of values of the NSI parameters, the CP sensitivity sees a drop most
likely due to the statistical eﬀect (a) dominating in these cases.

After understanding the impact of individual diagonal as well as oﬀ-diagonal NSI terms, we
now address the collective eﬀect of the most inﬂuential NSI terms as far as CP sensitivity
is concerned. In Fig. 6, we show the collective impact of the three terms (|εee|, |εeµ|, |εeτ|)
which show the largest impact when considered in isolation. We note that when the NSI
terms are small, the associated phases of the NSI terms (even if taken collectively) do
not contribute in an observable manner to (b) and (a) dominates. However when we take
somewhat larger values, we see the interplay of the the two eﬀects (a) and (b) with the
possibility of second eﬀect (b) overtaking the ﬁrst (a) as we go from small to large values
keeping the marginalisation range intact.

We summarize the impact of NSI on the CP violation sensitivity at long baselines as shown
in Fig. 6 for DUNE. If we compare the solid and dashed black curves, we note that for
small values of parameters (0.01, 0.01, 0.1) NSI brings down the χ2 from ∼ 5σ to ∼ 3σ at
δ ∼ ±π/2 for the case of zero NSI phases. The impact of true non-zero NSI phases can
be seen in the form of grey bands for the choice of moduli of the NSI terms. For larger
values of parameters (0.07, 0.07, 0.7) NSI can drastically alter the χ2 not only at δ (cid:39) ±π/2
(SI, maximum) but at almost all values of δ including at δ = 0,±π if we allow for phase
variation. For some particular choice of the NSI moduli and phases, we note that in this
case, the χ2 decreases from ∼ 5σ to ∼ 2.5σ or increases to ∼> 5.5σ not only at δ (cid:39) ±π/2 but
for most values of δ. This can lead to a misleading inference that CP is violated even when
we have CP conservation in the SI case (δ = 0,±π). Here the phases have a bigger impact
which can be seen as widening of the grey bands as we go from smaller to larger moduli of
NSI terms.

31 varied in the allowed range.
The black curve is for θ23 = 45 degrees and for our reference setup (provides a signiﬁcance of atleast 3σ for
∼ 55% of δ values).

3.2 Dependence on θ23 and δm2
31

The variation in CP sensitivity due to diﬀerent values of θ23 and δm2
31 in the allowed range
is shown in Fig. 7 for SI and NSI cases (zero NSI phases). For θ23, as can be seen from the
solid curves for SI, the signiﬁcance (in presence of diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal NSI) decreases
almost uniformly for all values of δ as θ23 becomes larger. This can be understood from
Eqs. 9 [43] and 12. The Pµe increases with θ23 and therefore the χ2 decreases. For no
extra phases, we expect the sensitivity in the presence of NSI to be lower than the SI case
due to the statistical eﬀect. For δm2
31, the solid curves for SI show that the signiﬁcance
does not change signiﬁcantly for all values of δCP as δm2
31 is varied. Once again this can
be understood from Eqs. 9 [43] and 12. The true value of δm2
31 does not impact Pµe and
therefore the χ2 remains almost the same.

3.3 Comparison with other experiments

We now discuss how various currently running and future experiments that will aid in
determining the CP violation sensitivity in conjunction with DUNE or in isolation. Before
we go on, we give a brief description of the experiments that are sensitive to the appearance
(νµ → νe) channel as well as the disappearance (νµ → νµ) channel.

T2K: The T2K experiment has a baseline of 295 km and the detector is placed at an oﬀ-
axis (2.5 degrees) location. An intense beam of neutrinos (mainly νµ or ¯νµ) produced in
the J-PARC accelerator facility in Tokai are directed towards the Super-Kamiokande
detector (22.5 kton ﬁducial mass) situated in Kamioka. The near detectors located 280

The νµ beam peaks at E ∼ 0.6 GeV which is close to the ﬁrst oscillation maximum of
Pµe. The proton beam power is 770 kW with proton energy of 50 GeV for 3 years (in
ν mode) + 3 years (in ¯ν mode) which corresponds to a total exposure of 8.3 × 1020
protons on target (p.o.t) per year.

NOvA: The NOvA experiment has a baseline of 810 km and the detector is placed at
an oﬀ-axis (0.8 degrees) location. NOvA stands for NuMI Oﬀ-axis νe Appearance
experiment. An intense beam of neutrinos (mainly νµ or ¯νµ) produced by ﬁring pro-
tons from Fermilab Main Injector on a graphite target. νµ(¯νµ) beamline is directed
towards a Totally Active Scintillator Detector (TASD) of ﬁducial mass 14 kton placed
in Ash River, Minnesota. This oﬀ-axis narrow-width beam peaks at ∼ 1.6 GeV which
is the energy at which νµ → νe oscilaltion sees a maximum. A 0.3 kton near detector
is located at the FermiLab site to monitor the un-oscillated neutrino ﬂux. The ex-
periment will be running in ν mode for 3 years and ¯ν mode for 3 years with a NuMI
beam power of 0.7 MW and 120 GeV proton energy, corresponding to 6.0× 1020 p.o.t
per year.

DUNE: The DUNE experiment has a baseline of 1300 km and the detector is placed at
an on-axis location. A new, high intensity, neutrino beam will be directed towards
a LArTPC located at Homestake at a distance of 1300 km. The νµ beam peaks at
E ∼ 2.5 GeV which is close to the ﬁrst oscillation maximum of Pµe. This facility
is designed for operation at a proton beam power of 1.0 MW, with proton energy of
in ∼ 200 days per calendar year. To have the
120 GeV that will deliver 1021 p.o.t.
LArTPC cross-sections, we have scaled the inclusive charged current cross sections of
water by 1.06(0.94) for the ν(¯ν) case.

T2HK: The T2HK experiment has a baseline of 295 km and the detector is placed at
the same oﬀ-axis (0.8 degrees) location as in T2K. The idea is to upgrade the T2K
experiment, with a much larger detector (560 kton ﬁducial mass) located in Kamioka
so that much larger statistics is ensured. T2HK will run for 1 year (in ν mode) + 3
years (in ¯ν mode). The proton beam power is 7.5 MW with proton energy of 30 GeV
that will deliver 1.6 × 1022 p.o.t. per year.

The detailed detector characteristics and systematic errors are listed in Table 2. In Table 3,
we list the energy integrated events 8 for the four experiments (using appearance and dis-
appearance channels) for neutrinos as well as antineutrinos for NH. One striking feature to
note is that the events in the disappearance channel are much larger than in the appearance
channel. This is due to the fact that the maximum value that Pµµ takes is close to 1 while
Pµe at best goes up to ∼ 0.1. The larger detector size of T2K compensates for the shorter
baseline when compared to the smaller detector of NOvA with a longer baseline and the
eventrates for the two experiments are comparable. The event rates are some what larger for
DUNE as it has a bigger detector in comparison to NOvA. But, T2HK with its massive
detector overcomes the limitation of baseline being short and gives the maximum number
of events.

The expected sensitivity oﬀered by diﬀerent experiments (singly or combined) is illustrated
in Figs. 6, 8 and 9. Fig. 6 shows the CP violation sensitivity for DUNE. In Fig. 8, we
show the CP sensitivity for T2K, NOvA and a combination of T2K, NOvA and DUNE.

Table 3: Total number of signal events (SI/NSI) summed over all energy bins for each
experiment using the oscillation parameters given in Table 1. For NSI, we show the collective
case when the NSI parameters |εeµ| = 0.07,|εeτ| = 0.07,|εee| = 0.7, ϕeµ = 0 and ϕeτ = 0 are
considered.

Finally, we show the CP violation sensitivity for T2HK in Fig. 9 which is competitive with
DUNE.
We have shown the CP violation sensitivity at DUNE in Fig. 6 and discussed the features
in Sec. 3.1. In Fig. 8, we show the CP sensitivity for T2K(top row), NOvA(middle row)
as well as a combination of T2K , NOvA and DUNE(bottom row). As in Fig. 6, the
characteristic double peak is seen for all the three cases in Fig. 8. If we now look at T2K
and NOvA individually, we note that the CP violation sensitivity almost never reaches 3σ
(it barely touches ∼ 1.6σ (for T2K) and ∼ 1.8σ (for NOvA)). This means that these two
current experiments considered in isolation are not so much interesting as far as CP violation
sensitivity is concerned. This does not come as a surprise as these are not optimized for
CP sensitivity. However, if we combine data from these two experiments with DUNE, we
note that CP violation sensitivity improves slightly (from ∼ 5.1σ to ∼ 5.6σ in the SI case
near the peak. For NSI (zero NSI phases, dashed black curve) it improves marginally from
∼ 3σ to ∼> 3σ. In general, we note that the if phases are taken into account, the grey bands
expand and even out as we go from small to large NSI, the peaks at δ ∼ ±π/2 smoothen
out which means that there is no clear demarkation of CPC (δ = 0,±π) and CPV values of

Figure 10: The CP fraction f (σ > 3) for which the sensitivity to CP violation is greater than 3σ as a
function of exposure for SI and NSI case assuming NH. The three plots correspond to three diﬀerent NSI
parameters taken one at a time with full phase variation. The red, green and blue shaded regions correspond
to diﬀerent values of εeµ and εeτ .

In Fig. 9, we show the CP violation sensitivity for T2HK. We note that T2HK oﬀers
CP sensitivity that is competitive with DUNE individually as well as T2K, NOvA and
DUNE combined (SI and NSI both). This can be ascribed to the high statistics oﬀered by
the HK. Near the peak, we note that it can go upto ∼ 8σ for SI and ∼> 5σ for NSI (zero
phases). Another intriguing feature from T2HK panel is that the NSI phases do not have
as dramatic eﬀect as seen for DUNE when the NSI terms are large - this can be seen as
shrinking of the grey regions in Fig. 9 (top panel, right most plot). This is due to the fact
that the baseline of 295 km is way too short for matter eﬀects (SI and NSI both) to develop
and play a signiﬁcant role9. This demonstrates the complementarity of bigger detectors
(T2HK) vis-a-vis the long baselines involved (DUNE) where no clear demarkation of CPC
(δ = 0,±π) and CPV values of δ was noticed.

experimental conﬁguration. The maximum value of f (σ > 3) guides the choice of optimal
exposure for CP violation discovery. Let us see how the choice of optimal exposure in case
of SI is arrived at. We have already noted that the CP violation sensitivity as a function of
δ has a double peak structure for SI due to the vanishing of the sensitivity at CP conserving
values of δ (= 0,±π). Therefore it is expected that none of the experiments considered in
the present work can lead to a 100% coverage in δ in the SI case. This no longer holds in
presence of NSI.

In Fig. 10, we show the CP fraction for which the sensitivity to CP violation exceeds 3σ as
a function of exposure, labelled as f (σ > 3). Let us ﬁrst understand the SI case, we note
that f (σ > 3) rises from 0 to ∼ 0.4 as a function of exposure initially as we go from 50− 150
kt.MW.yr but saturates to a value f (σ > 3) (cid:39) 0.5−0.55 as we go to exposures beyond ∼ 350
kt.MW.yr. Increasing the exposure further does not change this value drastically beyond
f (σ > 3) (cid:39) 0.5. This is not unexpected as we have already noticed that it is challenging to
exclude those values of CP phase which lie close to the CP conserving values (i.e., 0 and
π). So, in case of SI, the choice of optimal exposure is expected to be (cid:39) 350 kt.MW.yr.
Let us now discuss the impact of NSI on the choice of the optimal exposure. For the NSI
case, the three panels in Fig. 10 correspond to the three diﬀerent NSI terms (taken in
isolation). There are three coloured regions (blue, green, red) for the oﬀ-diagonal NSI terms
which correspond to the three values of moduli of NSI parameters along with their respective
phase variation (analogous to the grey bands seen in Fig. 3 and 4). For the diagonal NSI
terms, there are three dashed lines (blue, green, red) corresponding to three diﬀerent values
of diagonal NSI parameter εee (see Fig. 5). The plot on the left shows the impact of εeµ.
Even with the phase variation, f (σ > 3) (shown as red band) remains below the SI curve
for small value of εeµ (|εeµ| = 0.01). This is due to the dominating statistical eﬀect (a)
mentioned in Sec. 3.1. f (σ > 3) stays at zero and does not rise until an exposure of (cid:39) 150
kt.MW.yr is reached. Finally, it attains a value in the range (cid:39) 0.35 − 0.45 as we reach
exposures ∼ 400 kt.MW.yr. For intermediate and large values of εeµ (|εeµ| = 0.04, 0.07) on
the other hand, f (σ > 3) gets distributed over a larger range of values for some favourable
choice of parameters (due to the interplay of (a) and (b) mentioned in Sec. 3.1) as can be
seen from the green and blue bands. Incorporating the phase variation of the NSI parameter
leads to an increase in the value of f (σ > 3) and it can reach ∼ 1 when the exposure is
barely 200 kt.MW.yr (for some choice of phases, some part of the grey band is above the 3σ
line in Fig. 3 and 4 for all true values of δ). Similar eﬀects are seen for the other oﬀ-diagonal
parameter, εeτ which is shown in the middle panel. However for the diagonal NSI parameter
εee (which is real), we note that the f (σ > 3) (blue, green and red dashed lines) is always
smaller than in the SI case for a given choice of systematics (see also Fig. 5). This is again
due to the statistical eﬀect.

We have checked that if we take the true hierarchy as inverted hierarchy (IH) instead of
NH, the impact of NSI shown in Fig. 10 is grossly the same (see Table 4). The impact of
individual NSI terms on the value of f (σ > 3) at an exposure of 350 kt.MW.yr (which is
the optimal choice for SI) at DUNE is listed in Table 4 for NH and IH.

Figure 11: The CP fraction for which the sensitivity to CP violation is greater than 3σ as a function of
baseline for SI and NSI case. The black and blue solid curves correspond to the diﬀerent systematics assumed
for SI. The three plots correspond to three NSI parameters taken one at a time. The green (magenta) band
corresponds to the choice of nominal (optimal) systematics with full phase variation for the oﬀ-diagonal NSI
parameters while the green (magenta) dashed line corresponds to εee for nominal (optimal) systematics.

3.5 Role of systematics

The impact of diﬀerent assumptions on systematics can be seen in Fig. 11. The nominal set
of systematics is mentioned in Table 2. The black solid curve represents our nominal choice
of systematics given in Table 2 while the blue solid curve is for an optimal choice mentioned
in the legend [10]. The green (magenta) band corresponds to NSI case for oﬀ-diagonal
parameters εeµ, εeτ with full phase variation for nominal (optimal) choice of systematics.
The green (magenta) dashed curve is for εee for nominal (optimal) choice of systematics.
It can be seen that f (σ > 3) nearly reaches its maximum (∼ 0.55) possible value at around
1300 km for SI (see Fig. 11). This implies that for the given conﬁguration of the far
detector planned for DUNE (see Table 2), the optimal distance to be able to infer the
highest fraction of the values of the CP phase is ∼ 1300 km. Clearly, even in case of SI,
better systematics is expected to lead to a larger f (σ > 3) for a given baseline, say at 1300
km - it changes from ∼ 0.55 to ∼ 0.71. For the SI case, better systematics ensures better
detectability of CP violation quantiﬁed in terms of fraction f (σ > 3) and at the same time,
does not alter the optimal baseline choice for CP violation sensitivity. In case of NSI, the
green (magenta) band show the eﬀect of two choices of systematics and there is an overlap
between them as well as with the SI values. These aspects play a crucial role in altering
the choice of best baseline for CP violation sensitivity. However, in presence of NSI, for
the choice of NSI phases representing the top (bottom) edge of the green or magenta band
(we have used the dashed green or magenta lines to depict the diagonal NSI terms), the
optimal choice of baseline (Lopt) that maximizes the CP fraction changes as a function of
systematics (see Table 5).

4 Discussion and Conclusion

With tremendous progress on both theoretical and experimental fronts in neutrino oscillation
physics, we have fairly good idea of the neutrino masses and mixing pattern. The proposed
long baseline experiment, DUNE aims to hunt for the most sought after parameter, the CP
violating phase δ. In the era of precision, the subdominant eﬀects due to new physics such
as NSI, need to be incorporated carefully. We have discussed the impact of propagation
NSI on the standard procedure to determine the CP violation sensitivity at long baseline
experiments. The impact of NSI (including new CP phases) on the CP measurements at
DUNE using only the appearance channel was studied analytically as well as numerically
at the level of probability and event rates in Ref. [34]. In the present article, we perform a
full-ﬂedged sensitivity analysis using appearance and disappearance channels and quantify
the eﬀects at the level of χ2 and CP fraction f (σ > 3). We considered the NSI terms
individually ﬁrst and then a combination of the dominant ones. We also compare the
CP sensitivities with other ongoing experiments - T2K , NOvA and a future generation
experiment - T2HK.

We have found a general rule (in Sec. 3.1) that allows us to comprehend the results very
nicely. There are two opposing eﬀects at work - one is purely statistical which tends to
decrease the CP sensitivity while the other is due to inclusion of more CP phases - which
tends to increase the CP sensitivity. For diagonal NSI terms, only the ﬁrst eﬀect dominates
while for the oﬀ-diagonal NSI terms, under some favourable conditions, the additional CP
phases may enhance the sensitivity to CP violation as well as the value of CP fraction.
It is shown that DUNE is sensitive not only to CP violation eﬀects due to the genuine SI
CP phase [10] but also to additional (fake and genuine) CP violating eﬀects arising due to
moduli and phases of the NSI parameters. Finally, we can infer the following :

• The NSI parameters εeµ, εeτ and εee show the largest eﬀect in the Pµe channel. While
the NSI parameters εµτ , εµµ and ετ τ are expected to contribute to the Pµµ channel, we
do not consider them here because the disappearance channel by itself contributes very
little to the CP sensitivity owing to the absence of CP odd term in the probability.
Even if we consider these parameters, we ﬁnd that the εµµ is constrained very strongly

21

(Eq. 8). We have checked the impact of εµτ on the CP violation sensitivity using both
appearance and disappearance channels and it is found to be negligible for DUNE.
The eﬀect of ετ τ is shown in Fig. 5 and is smaller in comparison to εee. For these
reasons, we consider εeµ, εeτ and εee as the dominant NSI parameters aﬀecting CP
sensitivity.

• The dependence of CP sensitivity on the true values of θ23 and δm2
31 is depicted in
Fig. 7. While θ23 changes the sensitivity both for SI and NSI, the δm2
31 has minuscule
eﬀect. Since θ13 is measured very precisely [47], we don’t expect any change due to
the eﬀect of variation of the true value of θ13.

• We also compared the expected sensitivity of DUNE with current long baseline exper-
iments T2K , NOvA and a future experiment, T2HK. The long baseline experiments
- T2K and NOvA are not useful from the point of view of CP sensitivity both in
SI and NSI when considered in isolation but adding data to DUNE can lead to an
increase in sensitivity. Inspite of the short baseline of the future T2HK experiment,
the high statistics leads to sensitivity that is comparable to that obtained with longer
baseline experiment, DUNE. It is suggested [35] that a combination of DUNE and
T2HK may be able to improve constraints on some of the NSI parameters and may
also be able to resolve degeneracies.

• The impact of NSI on the CP fraction for which sensitivity to CP violation is greater
than 3σ at DUNE as a function of exposure is shown in Fig. 10. For smaller values
of the oﬀ-diagonal NSI terms, we note that the bands are always below the black solid
curve for SI. As we increase the value, the bands spread on either side of the black
curve. For diagonal NSI parameter, εee the curve due to NSI is always below the
black curve for the values considered here. Table 4 summarises the change in value of
f (σ > 3) compared to SI case for nominal systematics at an optimal exposure of 350
kt.MW.yr in case of DUNE for both NH and IH.

• The impact of change in systematics as a function of baseline is shown in Fig. 11 and
It is shown that the choice of optimal baseline changes when we include

Table 5.
eﬀects due to NSI.

We therefore conclude that new physics eﬀects such as propagation NSI spoil the CP sen-
sitivity at long baseline neutrino experiments in general and speciﬁcally in the context of
DUNE. This spoiling can be in either direction depending upon the strength of the NSI
terms involved. The problem then reduces to disentangling standard CP violation from the
non-standard CP violation.

Another observation that can be made from this study is that if f (σ > 3) such that
f (σ > 3) ∼ 1 (for shorter exposures) and signiﬁcantly larger than its value for the given sys-
tematics, then it unequivocally implies that there is new physics giving rise to it. Then the
task is to ﬁnd the new physics scenario uniquely that could give rise to such a large value.
However if f (σ > 3) stays far from unity for reasonable exposures then we can constrain
the NSI terms very well using long baseline experiments such as DUNE.

If we look at diﬀerent experiments, naturally the impact of NSI will be less for the relatively
shorter baselines since the amount of matter traversed will be less. So, T2K, and T2HK

22

experience a lesser impact than NOvA and DUNE. For shorter baselines such as 295
km, the characteristic double peak structure of the CP sensitivity curve as a function of
true δ survives and there is clear distinction between the CP conserving and CP violating
cases. T2HK due to the shorter baseline and high statistics does better in demarcating
the CP conserving and CP violating values as the grey bands are not so broad. However
for longer baselines such as for NOvA and DUNE, the CP sensitivity as a function of δ
ﬂattens out for some choice of phases of the relevant NSI parameters (upper edge of the
grey band). This poses a problem in diﬀerentiating the CP conserving and CP violating
cases. In eﬀect, this can mask/obscure the measurement of SI CP phase, if the nature had
it to be CP conserving. For favourable values of the CP phase, DUNE will be competitive
with T2HK. But, if CP phases were in the unfavourable region, then the future T2HK
experiment will be very promising.
