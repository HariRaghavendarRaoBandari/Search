(Dated: March 31, 2016)

The discovery of superconductivity in the rare earth-based half-Heusler semimetals RT Bi (R=rare
earth, T =Pt, Pd) [1–5] has opened a new avenue for investigation of topological phases of matter.
With charge carrier densities several orders of magnitude lower than conventional metals, these
materials pose a challenge for investigating the nature of the superconducting state, which itself may
have inherent topological properties. Here, we report experimental evidence for an unconventional
superconducting state in YPtBi, which presents a striking linear temperature dependence of the
London penetration depth consistent with line nodes in the superconducting order parameter ∆.
With strong antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling giving rise to spin-split Fermi surfaces – as veriﬁed
by angle-dependent Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
– we propose a k · p model of j = 3/2 fermions that naturally leads to exotic nodal Cooper pairing
states with high total angular momentum. With the simplest gap model involving a dominant J = 3
septet pairing between the j = 3/2 fermions of the p-like Γ8 band, the topological pairing states in
this half-Heusler compound present a truly novel form of superconductivity that has strong potential
for leading the development of a new series of topological superconductors.

When spin-orbit coupling is strong enough to rearrange
the order of electronic energy bands, various topologi-
cal phases arise, and the interplay between superconduc-
tivity and the topologically ordered phase is of particu-
lar interest [6, 7]. The noncentrosymmetric half-Heusler
compounds containing heavy metallic elements exhibit
a strong spin-orbit coupling which can invert s-like Γ6
and p-like Γ8 bands, giving a semimetal system with
non-trivial topological electronic structure with j = 3/2
character of conduction electrons [8–10]. The observa-
tion of superconductivity in the RPtBi [1–5, 11] and and
RPdBi series [5] (where R=rare earth) has added a new
richness to these materials that compounds topological
aspects of normal state band structure, superconductiv-
ity and even magnetic order [12]. In the superconduct-
ing state wavefunction, non-trivial topologies can arise
both in fully gapped superconductors [13] and uncon-
ventional superconductors with point or line nodes, in
particular in Weyl and noncentrosymmetric supercon-
ductors [14].
In the latter, the lack of parity symme-
try can lead to mixed even-odd parity pairing states on
spin-split Fermi surfaces due to asymmetric spin-orbit
coupling [15, 16]. The situation in these materials is fur-
ther enriched by the four-fold degeneracy of the Γ8 p-
like band, with total angular momentum j = 3/2. Pair-
ing among the j = 3/2states allows for Cooper pairs
with angular momentum beyond the usual spin-singlet

or spin-triplet states.
In particular, high angular mo-
mentum even- and odd-parity pairing components with
quintet (J = 2) and septet (J = 3) may appear. This
unique combination allows for the realization of an un-
precedented exotic pairing state [17].

Here we focus on the archetype topological half-
Heusler YPtBi, a clean limit superconductor with an ex-
tremely small electronic density of states N (0) at the
Fermi level [20], corresponding to a tiny carrier density
n ≈ 2×1018 cm−3 [2] that rivals that of the record-holder
SrTiO3 [21]. The superconducting phase transition at
Tc = 0.78 K [2] cannot be explained within the BCS
theory framework, which would require a carrier den-
sity nearly three orders of magnitude larger to explain
the critical temperature [22], and the linear in tempera-
ture upper critical ﬁeld Hc2(0) = 1.5 T exceeds the or-
bital pair-breaking limit for a conventional s-wave pairing
mechanism [2, 23], similar to the topological supercon-
ductors CuxBi2Se3 [24] and Bi2Se3 under pressure [25].
Furthermore, point contact spectroscopy measurements
in the superconducting state exhibit several anomalous
aspects (see SI for details). First, a very large energy gap
of 0.2-0.3 meV, also observed in scanning tunneling spec-
troscopy experiments [26], corresponds to at least twice
the BCS expectation of ∆0 = 1.76kBTc = 0.1 meV for
a fully gapped superconductor with Tc = 0.8 K. Second,
a sharp, non-Andreev-like peak of conductance centered

London penetration depth λ in YPtBi. (a) Temperature variation of ∆λ(T ) of YPtBi in various magnetic
ﬁelds over the entire superconducting temperature range. (b) Low temperature zoom of ∆λ(T ) of three materials measured
in zero dc ﬁeld (2 µT ac ﬁeld), plotted as normalized temperature, with noncentrosymmetric crystal structure of the cubic
half-Heusler material shown in the inset. YPtBi (solid circles) is compared directly with KFe2As2 (open circles; Tc = 3.4 K),
an unconventional superconductor with line nodes [18], and the anisotropic s-wave superconductor CaPd2As2 (open triangles;
Tc = 1.3 K) [19], both taken using an identical experimental setup. The solid line through the YPtBi data represents the best
ﬁtting to a power-law, ∆λ(T ) = AT n with n = 1.20 ± 0.02 and A = 1.98 ± 0.08 µm/K1.2 for temperatures up to 0.2Tc. The

blue line through CaPd2As2 data is the BCS s-wave expectation, ∆λ(T )/λ(0) =(cid:112)π∆0/2kBT exp(−∆0/kBT ) where ∆0 is an

isotropic gap at zero temperature. Note the diﬀerence in scales of the vertical axes: the right vertical axis is used for CaPd2As2
due to relatively weak variations of ∆λ(T ), while the data for KFe2As2 are scaled by a factor of 1/15. The extremely large
relative magnitude of ∆λ(T ) for YPtBi is explained by the very low charge carrier density (see text).

at zero bias lies in contrast to the typical split-peak ﬂat-
tened enhancement observed in s-wave superconductors
[27], and is very reminiscent of the odd-parity state in
Sr2RuO4 [28].

To elucidate the superconducting gap structure, we fo-
cus on measurements of the temperature-dependent Lon-
don penetration depth ∆λ(T ), which is intimately re-
lated to the superconducting order parameter ∆ [29].
This approach is particularly useful in the case of YPtBi,
where thermodynamic signatures of the superconduct-
ing state are diﬃcult to measure, since λ2 is inversely
proportional to N (0). In fact, the absolute value of the
zero-temperature λ(0) is 1.6 µm [23], about two orders of
magnitude greater than that found in conventional super-
conductors with Tc ∼ 1 K, such as zinc or aluminum. As
show in Figure 1, a sharp Tc is observed to be consistent
with transport measurements [2, 23], and is broadened
by application of magnetic ﬁelds.

We compare the low-temperature behavior of ∆λ(T )
in YPtBi to that of KFe2As2 [18], an unconventional su-
perconductor with line nodes [18], and the anisotropic
s-wave superconductor CaPd2As2 [19], both taken us-
ing an identical experimental setup. The contrast is
striking, with ∆λ(T ) in YPtBi being nearly identical to
that of KFe2As2 and completely diﬀerent than that of
CaPd2As2. In a fully-gapped s-wave superconductor, the
thermally activated quasiparticles are responsible for the
expected exponential temperature dependence of ∆λ(T )

at low temperatures (see SI for details), while power laws
are clear signatures of nodes or zeroes in the supercon-
ducting order parameter.
In a gap structure with line
nodes, the penetration depth varies linearly with tem-
perature at suﬃciently low temperatures in a clean sam-
ple [30] (see SI for details), such as observed in the pro-
totypical d-wave superconductor YB2Cu3O6.95 [31], as
well as the mixed-parity noncentrosymmetric supercon-
ductors CePt3Si [32] and Li2Pt3B [33].
In YPtBi, ∆λ(T ) is best ﬁt to a power-law function
∆λ = AT n with n = 1.20 ± 0.02 and A = 1.98 ± 0.08
µm/K1.2 in a temperature range that spans up to 0.2Tc.
This is nearly consistent with the T -linear expectation
for a line node superconductor, and in fact the observed
small deviation from linearity is likely due to moderate
impurity scattering, quantiﬁed by modifying the temper-
ature dependence ∆λ(T ) = bT 2/(T + T ∗) [34] with scat-
tering rate parameter T ∗ = 0.07Tc, indicating an excep-
tionally clean sample. The extraordinarily large power-
law pre-factor A in YPtBi is consistent with the London
theory expectation λ(0) ∝ n−2 given the small carrier
density of this material. Together, this clearly rules out
a conventional fully gapped scenario for YPtBi, and pro-
vides strong evidence for the existence of line nodes in
the superconducting order parameter.

To establish a proper pairing model

for YPtBi,
we employ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calcula-

FIG. 2. YPtBi band structure and Fermi surface Angle-resolved photoemission measurements of valence band dispersions
are displayed in panels (a) and (b). The spectra were measured at hν=86 eV, which cuts close to the (111)-oriented Brillouin
zone center at normal emission. Surface-based bands, indicated by “s” labels and red-dotted line guides, originate from a
Bi-terminated (111) cleavage plane (see text for details). Panel (b) presents an expanded view of the near-EF bands at the
Γ-point zone center, with black dashed lines representing DFT calculated bulk band structure along Γ-L with energy alignment
to the Rashba-split bands at -0.5 eV, also shown in panel (c). Panel (d) presents the theoretical spin-split Fermi surfaces
obtained by ﬁtting the j = 3/2 k · p theory in Eq. 1 to ARPES and ab initio results in (c) by ﬁxing the chemical potential
at µ = −35meV (see text). Panels (e) and (f) present cross sections of the Fermi surfaces along [100] and [110] direction,
respectively.

tions to characterize the electronic structure. As shown
in Fig. 2(a), numerous bands are observed to cross the
Fermi-level (EF) from the zone boundary to normal emis-
sion. Consistent with ARPES measurements of LuPtBi
and GdPtBi [35], the photon energy dependence of most
of these bands follows strong vertical streaks along kz
indicative of 2D surface states. Theoretical slab calcula-
tions [35] have determined that the surface states, labeled
s in Fig. 2, originate from a Bi-terminated (111) cleavage
plane, and that they are of non-topological origin owing
to an even number of EF-crossings with the surface Bril-
louin zone.

uum for a week is observed to suppress all the surface
states and leave a single fuzzy broad hole-band feature
that reaches to EF. A similar inner-hole band pocket
was also observed as a single-band with weak intensity
in LuPtBi and GdPtBi [35] and assumed to be a pair of
nearly degenerate bands from comparison to their slab
calculations. Here we argue it is a pseudo-spin splitting
stemming from the total angular momentum j = 3/2
spins, originating from the absence of inversion symme-
try. This allows for an antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling,
similar to Rashba spin-orbit coupling in tetragonal sys-
tems.

An expanded view of the normal emission zone-center
bands, shown in Fig. 2(b), reveals four hole-like EF-band
crossings suggestive of a pair of spin-split bands. While
the outer most pair of bands exhibit 2D-like behavior, the
smaller spin-split hole band exhibits a stronger modula-
tion of ARPES intensity around the 86 eV bulk Γ-point.
Consistent with a bulk-assignment of this inner spin-split
hole-band, aging of the surface in a poorer storage vac-

The calculated spin-split bulk Γ-point bands along the
high symmetry points are shown for comparison in Fig.
2(c), conﬁrming the topological band inversion of s-like
Γ6 and p-like Γ8 bands as shown previously [36, 37]. A
maximum splitting of the valence hole-band is observed
along (111) and zero-splitting degeneracy along (100) (Γ-
X). Note the splittings will disappear in a non-relativistic
calculation, and also it is common to have these spin

FIG. 3. Signature of spin-split Fermi surfaces in YPtBi Angle-dependent Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations were used to
demonstrate the geometry of the spin-split Fermi surfaces. We plot the magnetoresistance derivative, dRxx/dH, to extract the
oscillatory component (actual magnetoresistance data are shown in SI section). (a) dRxx/dH vs. H at various polar angles
θ deﬁned from crystallographic [100] direction, measured at 2 K. A beating frequency node-like feature, observable near 12 T
for θ = 0◦, moves up in magnetic ﬁeld as polar angle is increased away from the high symmetry direction, either in positive or
negative directions. (b) Comparison of θ = 75◦ and 90◦oscillatory component plotted as a function of inverse ﬁeld (1/µ0H).
The beating pattern node is readily visible in 90◦ data near ∼ 0.14 T−1, similarly to previous work [2], but moves out of visible
range in the 75◦ data. This observation at higher angles conﬁrms the angle-and ﬁeld-dependent node shifting found in lower
angle data. (c) FFT of dRxx/dH for θ = 75◦ and 90◦. In both angles, application of FFT results in a broad peak centered at
about 49 T. The full width at half maximum is about 30 T for both angles, so the beating frequencies are unfortunately not
discernible by this technique. Nevertheless, nearly angle-independent SdH frequency strongly supports the theoretical Fermi
surfaces in Fig. 2.

splittings vanish at high symmetry points and along high
symmetry directions. This is because there are symme-
try elements that require band degeneracies, which are
removed when we move away from these special points.

Figs. 2(a) and (b) show a characteristic Rashba split-
ting of two hole bands at ≈ 0.5 eV binding energy which
also appear in bulk band structure calculations, but at
an energy of ≈ -0.8 eV below EF. Shifting the theory
Γ-L bands to higher energy by ≈ 0.3 eV to align to the
Rashba-split bulk bands, as shown in overplotted dashed
lines in Fig. 2(b), causes two other nearly-degenerate
hole-like bulk bands that originally just touch EF at
a semimetal point, to form a hole-pocket. This large
0.3 eV chemical potential shift in the ARPES measure-
ment, relative to the theory calculation, reﬂects a pos-
sible charge imbalance at the cleaved surface and resul-
tant band bending relative to the bulk. The experimental
SdH oscillation frequency of F = 45 T [2] corresponds to
a cross sectional area of a hypothetical spherical Fermi
surface AF ≈ 0.43 nm−2 and a kF≈0.037 ˚A−1, using the
Onsager relation F = φ0AF /2π2 where AF = πk2
F and
φ0 = 2.07 × 10−7 G cm−2, which is much smaller than
the ARPES kF values in Fig. 2(b) of ≈ 0.1 ˚A−1. This
supports the scenario of a charge imbalance at the sur-

face and band bending with the bulk chemical potential
only ≈10 meV below the hole-band maximum.

The most interesting aspect of the band inversion and
the experimental position of the chemical potential in
the Γ8 band arises due to the j = 3/2 total angular mo-
mentum, which comes from spin-orbit coupling of spin
s = 1/2 electrons in the l = 1 p-orbitals of Bi. With
the chemical potential shifted to -0.32 eV consistent with
the ARPES measurements, the resulting theoretical spin-
split Fermi surfaces consist of slightly warped inward and
outward spheres with the degenerate point along [100] di-
rections. To verify the presence of nearly spherical spin-
split bulk Fermi surfaces we studied the angle-dependent
Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) eﬀect, which is clearly visible
at most angles above ∼6 T as shown in Fig. 3. Data
obtained at small angles up to θ = 25◦ away from the
[100] direction reveal a ﬁeld-dependent node that moves
monotonically towards higher ﬁeld, starting from 12 T
at 0◦. The shape of oscillation near the node is sym-
metric about θ = 0◦ [100], indicating the node pattern is
based on the crystal symmetry. A node in the oscillation
is a hallmark of superposition of two similar oscillations,
which is often observed in a corrugated 2D Fermi sur-
face [38–40] and also in the spin-split Fermi surfaces as a

this case, the quantum oscillation is arising from the bulk
Fermi surface which is supported by strong oscillations
with ﬁeld along the measured plane (θ = 90◦) as well
as 75◦ data as shown in Fig. 3(b). We performed FFT
on the ﬁrst derivative of these two angles as a function
of 1/µ0H, and the resultant frequencies are nearly the
same (F = 49 T) shown in Fig. 3(c), which supports the
3D Fermi surface.
Near the Fermi energy, we model the Γ8 bands by a
j = 3/2 k · p theory [43]. Up to quadratic order in k the
single-particle Hamiltonian is

are 4 × 4 matrix representations of the j = 3/2 angu-
lar momentum operators. The ﬁrst line of Eq. (1) is the
Luttinger-Kohn model, while the second line is the an-
tisymmetric SOC. The parameters α, β, γ, and δ are
chosen by ﬁtting to our ab initio calculations adjusted
against ARPES results, which yields α = 20.5 eVa2/π2,
β = −18.5 eVa2/π2, γ = −12.7 eVa2/π2, and δ =
0.025eVa/π by ﬁxing the chemical potential at µ =
−35meV, where a is the lattice constant taken from Ref.
[44]. The observed low density of hole carriers is consis-
tent with a Fermi energy lying close to the top of the hole
bands, yielding typical Fermi surfaces shown in Fig. 2(d)
with cross sections (e) and (f) along [100] and [110] di-
rection, respectively.

The Hamiltonian Eq. (1) has two major implications
for the superconductivity in YPtBi. Firstly, since the
quasiparticles in the Γ8 band have intrinsic angular mo-
mentum j = 3/2, they can form Cooper pairs with higher
intrinsic angular momentum than allowed by the conven-
tional theory of j = 1/2 quasiparticle pairing; speciﬁcally,
in addition to the familiar singlet (J = 0) and triplet
(J = 1) states, we must also consider quintet (J = 2) and
septet (J = 3) pairing. Secondly, the absence of inver-
sion symmetry (manifested by the antisymmetric SOC)
implies that a stable superconducting state will be domi-
nated by pairing between quasiparticles in time-reversed
states near the Fermi energy [15]. As detailed in the sup-
plemental material, this condition is generically satisﬁed
by a mixture of conventional s-wave singlet pairing with
an unconventional p-wave septet pairing state [17]. While
most noncentrosymmetric superconductors harbor dom-
inant even-parity pairing resulting in a fully gapped or-
der parameter, the penetration depth behavior in YPtBi
necessitates an order parameter with line nodes, which
in the simplest and most likely case, requires dominant
J = 3 septet and subdominant J = 0 singlet pairing.

5

resulting from this mixed singlet-septet state displays
topologically-protected line nodes on one of the spin-split
Fermi surfaces. These line nodes are topologically non-
trivial and lead to nondegenerate surface zero-energy ﬂat
bands [14], which are of immense interest in the context
of topological excitations. Although the mixed singlet-
septet state is a natural generalization of the theory
of j = 1/2 noncentrosymmetric superconductors, other
pairing states are also consistent with the observation of
gap nodes and the breaking of inversion symmetry. Of
particular interest is on-site pairing in a quintet state,
which realizes a time-reversal symmetry-breaking nodal
gap within the framework of weak-coupling theory [17].
(While the quintet gap nodes are also topological, they do
not generically yield ﬂat bands [45].) Furthermore, with
a conventional Eliashberg theory unapplicable to such
a low carrier density system, one must consider other
pairing instabilities such as parity ﬂuctuations [46, 47]
as possible mechanisms of superconductivity in the half-
Heusler system. Studying the pairing mechanism of these
exotic high angular momentum pairing states, as well as
their interplay with other symmetry-breaking orders [5],
will elucidate the complexity and richness of this family
of multi-faceted topological materials.

METHODS

YPtBi single crystals were grown out of molten Bi with
the starting composition Y:Pt:Bi = 1:1:20 (atomic ra-
tio). The starting materials Y ingot (99.5%), Pt pow-
der (99.95%) and Bi chunk (99.999%) were put into an
alumina crucible, and the crucible was sealed inside an
evacuated quartz ampule. The ampule was heated slowly
to 1150◦C, kept for 10 hours, and then cooled down to
500◦C at a 3◦C/hour rate where the excess of molten Bi
was decanted by centrifugation.

The temperature variation of London penetration
depth ∆λ(T ) was measured in a commercial dilution
refrigerator by using a precise tunnel diode resonator
(TDR) technique in various dc magnetic ﬁelds Hdc. The
single-crystal sample with dimensions (0.29×0.69×0.24)
mm3 was mounted on a sapphire rod and inserted into a
2 mm inner diameter copper coil that produces rf exci-
tation ﬁeld with empty-resonator frequency of 22 MHz
with amplitude Hac ≈ 2 µT. The shift of the reso-
nant frequency (in cgs units), ∆f (T ) = −G4πχ(T ),
where χ(T ) is the diﬀerential magnetic susceptibility,
G = f0Vs/2Vc(1 − N ) is a constant, N is the demag-
netization factor, Vs is the sample volume and Vc is the
coil volume. The constant G was determined from the
full frequency change by physically pulling the sample
out of the coil. With the characteristic sample size, R,
4πχ = (λ/R) tanh(R/λ) − 1, from which ∆λ can be ob-
tained [29].

band quasiparticles involved in Cooper pairing in YPtBi, our j = 3/2 k · p model yields a manifold of possible pairing states
with intrinsic angular momenta up to J = 3. Incorporating the lack of inversion symmetry, the singlet-septet pairing state is
the simplest even-odd parity mixture with nodes in the pairing gap that arise from the dominant J = 3 septet component.
Panels (a)-(b) present the distribution of gap amplitudes on the spin-split Fermi surfaces of YPtBi, with a full gap on the outer

magnitude of each gap ∆k/max(|∆k|) along high symmetry points are presented for full gap and nodal gap in red and blue,

formed on cleaved single crystals that tend to reveal small
regions of (111)-oriented surfaces suitable for observation
of sharp bands. Measurements were performed at the
MERLIN Beamline 4.0.3 at the Advanced Light Source
in the photon energy (hν) range of 30-150 eV, using a Sci-
enta R8000 hemispherical electron energy analyzer with
energy resolution set to ≈ 20 meV, and with the sample
cooled to ≈ 30 K in a vacuum of better than 5 × 10−11
Torr.

Magnetic ﬁeld-dependent magnetoresistance was de-
termined on samples by using a standard four-probe tech-
nique. Contacts were made by using high purity silver
wires and conducting epoxy, and measurements were per-
formed in a commercial cryostat with a single-axis rotator
in magnetic ﬁelds up to 14 T.

Point contact spectroscopy was performed using the
“soft” point contact technique, with conductance spectra
measured on a polished surface of single crystal YPtBi.
Contact junctions were prepared by attaching a bent
25 µm gold wire to a sample using DuPont 4929N silver
paste. Typical junctions were on the order of 0.1 µm in
diameter achieved by pre-coating the surface with a thin
layer of stycast with a small hole. dI/dV spectra were
measured in a commercial 3He cryostat. AC conductivity
vs. DC bias voltage was measured in zero magnetic ﬁeld
at several temperatures between 400 mK and 1.8 K and
at multiple applied magnetic ﬁelds at 400 mK.

, where N (0) is the total density of states at Fermi level
per spin, v is the Fermi velocity, and ω is the Matsub-

depth utilizes a small excitation ﬁeld Hac < 2µT, so the
Eq. (2) is valid in absence of Hdc.

be deduced from Eq. (2) for a constant gap ∆ = ∆0,
while in a d-wave superconductor ∆λ(T ) varies linearly
with temperature as ∆λ(T ) = 2λ(0) ln 2
T , at suﬃciently
low temperatures in a clean sample [30]. Here, µ is the
angular slope parameter near the node, e.g., µ = 2 for
a d-wave gap ∆ = ∆0(k2
y). To compare the exper-
imental result for YPtBi to the d-wave gap expectation,
one can ﬁx the temperature power of ∆λ(T ) to n = 1
and obtain a slope prefactor A = 1.5 µm/K from ﬁtting,
yielding 2∆0/kBTc ≈ 4/µ. Fixing µ = 2 for the d-wave
case gives 2∆0 ≈ 2kBTc, which is slightly smaller than
the weak-coupling BCS value of 2∆0 = 3.52kBTc, and
signiﬁcantly smaller than the observed value for YPtBi
observed in STM [26] and point contact measurements
(see below).

Electronic structure

The electronic band structure of YPtBi was ob-
tained using the WIEN2K [48] implementation of the
full potential linearized augmented plane wave method
with the Tran-Blaha modiﬁed Becke-Johnson exchange-
correlation potential (MBJLDA) [49], with spin-orbital
coupling included in the calculation. The k-point mesh
was taken to be 11×11×11, and cubic lattice constant
a = 664.0(1) pm was obtained from Ref.
[44]. Fig. 5
presents the calculated band structure for YPtBi. The
s-like band Γ6 lies below the p-like band Γ8, reﬂecting the
nontrivial topology, consistent with previous calculations
[36, 37].

pseudospin-1/2 index. Proceeding via degenerate pertur-
bation theory, we now include the ASOC by projecting it
into the pseudospin basis for each band, hence obtaining
two eﬀective pseudospin-1/2 Hamiltonians
Heﬀ,± = k,±ˆs0 + gk,± · ˆs

(4)

where ˆsµ are the Pauli matrices for the pseudospin, and
the vector gk,± = −g−k,± represents the eﬀective ASOC
in the pseudospin-1/2 basis of the band k,±. The expres-
sion for gk,± is complicated and depends upon the choice
of pseudospin basis; an analytic expression for |gk,±| is
given elsewhere [17]. The eﬀective pseudospin-1/2 Hamil-
tonians can be diagonalized by going over to the helicity
basis, yielding dispersions Ek,η=±,ν=± = k,η + ν|gk,η|,
where the values of η and ν are independent of one an-
other. In particular, the two spin-split Fermi surfaces are
labelled by opposite values of ν. This approximation is in
excellent agreement with the exact solutions of the k · p
for small antisymmetric SOC.

We treat the assymetric spin-orbit coupling (ASOC) as
a perturbation of the Luttinger-Kohn model, which has
doubly-degenerate eigenenergies

where k± = kx ± iky. This constitutes a mixed state
involving s-wave singlet pairing with strength ∆s and p-
wave septet pairing with strength ∆p. The gap near the
Fermi energy can be found by projecting Eq. 6 into the
eﬀective pseudospin-1/2 bands, yielding

∆eﬀ,± = [∆s + (∆p/δ)(gk,± · ˆs)] iˆsy .

(7)

This describes a mixture of pseuodospin-singlet and
pseudospin-triplet pairing. Importantly, the d-vector of
the eﬀective pseudospin-triplet pairing is parallel to the
ASOC vector gk,±. As pointed out by Frigeri et al. [15],
this alignment makes the pseudospin-triplet component
immune to the pair-breaking eﬀect of the ASOC; for suf-
ﬁciently large ASOC, it is the only stable odd-parity gap.
If the singlet state is subdominant, the resulting gap dis-
plays line nodes on one of the spin-split Fermi surfaces.

Soft point-contact spectroscopy

Figure 6 shows the results from point-contact spec-
troscopy measurements on a single crystal YPtBi. The
spectra shows strong temperature-and ﬁeld-dependence
on the temperature-and ﬁeld-independent ﬂat back-
ground conductance at high bias as shown respectively
in Fig 6(a) and (b). Thus, the observed shape of spectra
represents the superconducting gap. The data in Fig. 6
were normalized by dividing by the high bias value for

cally up to Vbias = 0.
In addition to the shape of the
curves, other aspects of the data are also unusual com-
pared to what is expected for conventional superconduc-
tivity. First, the zero bias enhancement shown in Fig. 6
persists at values of temperature and magnetic ﬁeld that
are above the values of Tc and Hc2 that were determined
from the resistivity measurements [2, 23]. Second, the
size of these gap features is also quite large compared to
the expected BCS gap value of ∆0 = 1.76kBTc = 0.1 meV
for a Tc of 0.7 K. In fact, based on the peak width the
gap size appears to be at least twice the BCS value. This
large deviation from the BCS theory provides further ev-
idence against the conventional s-wave model.

FIG. 6. Soft point-contact spectroscopy conductance spectra
of YPtBi as a function of (a) temperature and (b) magnetic
ﬁeld. An enhancement of roughly 40% is observed at zero bias
for 0.4 K base temperature in zero ﬁeld. Note the persistence
of the conductance peak associated with the superconducting
gap to temperatures above Tc = 0.78 K, which may have a
relation to the associated theory of j = 3/2 pairing [17].

Angle-dependent magnetoresistance

To measure angular dependence of transverse magne-
toresistance (MR), we chose polar angles from crystal-
lographic [100] direction, which was veriﬁed by a sin-
gle crystal x-ray diﬀraction experiment, shown in Fig.
7(a). Field-dependent MR data in various polar angles
are shown in 7(b). 0◦ data show almost 200% increased
MR at 14 T compared to the resistance in the absence of
