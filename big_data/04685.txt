Abstract The Walsh transform bQ of a quadratic function Q : Fpn → Fp satis-
ﬁes |bQ(b)| ∈ {0, p

n as C2 = {Q(x) = Trn(P(n/2)−1
as D = {Q(x) = Trn(P⌊n/2⌋

2 } for all b ∈ Fpn, where 0 ≤ s ≤ n−1 is an integer depend-
ing on Q. In this article, we study the following three classes of quadratic func-
tions of wide interest. The class C1 is deﬁned for arbitrary n as C1 = {Q(x) =
aix2i+1) : ai ∈ F2}, and the larger class C2 is deﬁned for even
aix2i+1) + Trn/2(an/2x2n/2+1) : ai ∈ F2}.
For an odd prime p, the subclass D of all p-ary quadratic functions is deﬁned
i=0 aixpi+1) : ai ∈ Fp}. We determine the distri-
bution of the parameter s for C1, C2 and D. As a consequence we obtain the
distribution of the nonlinearity for the rotation symmetric quadratic Boolean
functions, and in the case p > 2, our results yield the distribution of the co-
dimensions for the rotation symmetric quadratic p-ary functions, which have
been attracting considerable attention recently. We also present the complete
weight distribution of the subcodes of the second order Reed-Muller codes
corresponding to C1 and C2.

1 Introduction

Omitting the linear and constant terms, a quadratic function Q from Fpn to
Fp, for a prime p, can be expressed in trace form as

Q(x) = Trn

⌊n/2⌋Xi=0

aixpi+1 ,

ai ∈ Fpn ,

(1)

where Trn denotes the absolute trace from Fpn to Fp. When n is odd, this
representation is unique. For even n the coeﬃcient an/2 is taken modulo the
additive subgroup G = {x ∈ Fpn : Trn
n/2 denotes
the relative trace from Fpn to F
pn/2. Furthermore, if p = 2, then a0 = 0, hence
i in the summation in (1) ranges over 1 ≤ i ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, since a0x2 is a linear
term.

n/2(x) = 0} of Fpn , where Trn

Fpn into the set of complex numbers deﬁned as

The Walsh transform bf of a function f : Fpn → Fp is the function from

bf (b) = Xx∈Fpn

ǫf (x)−Trn(bx)
p

,

where ǫp = e2πi/p is a complex p-th root of unity.

Quadratic functions belong to the class of plateaued functions, for which

p(n+s)/2 for some ﬁxed integer 0 ≤ s ≤ n. Accordingly we call f s-plateaued.

for every b ∈ Fpn , the Walsh transform bf (b) vanishes or has absolute value
Note that if p = 2, then ǫp = −1, and bf (b) is an integer. Hence for any s-

plateaued function from F2n to F2, n and s must be of the same parity. Recall
that a 0-plateaued function from Fpn to Fp is called bent. Clearly a Boolean
bent function can exist only when n is even. When p is odd, a 1-plateaued
function is called semi-bent. A Boolean function f is called semi-bent, if f is
1 or 2-plateaued, depending on the parity of n.

The nonlinearity Nf of a function f : Fpn → Fp is deﬁned to be the smallest

Hamming distance of f to any aﬃne function, i.e.

Nf = min

u∈Fpn ,v∈Fp

|{x ∈ Fpn : f (x) 6= Trn(ux) + v}| .

The nonlinearity of a Boolean function f can be expressed in terms of the
Walsh transform as

Nf = 2n−1 −

b∈F2n

|bf (b)| .

By Parseval’s identity we havePb∈F2n(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)bf (b)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

= 22n for any Boolean function
f . As a consequence, Boolean bent functions are the Boolean functions at-
taining the highest possible nonlinearity. Since high nonlinearity is crucial for
cryptographic applications, Boolean bent functions are of particular interest.

Recall that the rth order Reed-Muller code R(r, n) of length 2n is deﬁned

as

R(r, n) = {(f (α1), f (α2), · · · , f (α2n)) | f ∈ Pr} ,

where Pr is the set of all polynomials from F2n to F2 (or from Fn
2 to F2) of
algebraic degree at most r, and α1, α2, . . . , α2n are the elements of F2n (or Fn
2 )
in some ﬁxed order. The set of quadratic Boolean functions together with the
constant and aﬃne functions form the second order Reed-Muller codes.

In this work we focus on the subclasses of the set of quadratic functions
given in Equation (1), obtained by restricting the coeﬃcients to the prime
subﬁeld. Namely, for p = 2 we consider C1 and the larger class C2 deﬁned as

C1 =
Q(x) = Trn
C2 =
Q(x) = Trn

⌊(n−1)/2⌋Xi=1

aix2i+1 + Trn/2(an/2x2n/2+1) :

, and

an/2, ai ∈ F2, 1 ≤ i ≤ n/2) .

Note that C1 is deﬁned for arbitrary n, while C2 is deﬁned for even n only.
These two classes of Boolean functions have attracted signiﬁcant attention in
the last decade, see the articles [9,4,5,8,10,11,13,14,15]. For p > 2 we put

D =
Q(x) = Trn

⌊n/2⌋Xi=0

aixpi+1 : ai ∈ Fp

.

The class D has also been studied previously, see [9,10,12,13,14].

The study of the Walsh spectrum of quadratic functions in C1 and D has
been initiated in [10], where the authors determine all n for which all such
quadratic functions are semi-bent. This result was extended in [4] for C1. In
the articles [8,15] bent functions in C2 are constructed.

Enumeration of functions in C1, C2 and D for particular values of s has
been a challenging problem. In [15] the number of bent functions in C2 was
obtained for some special classes of n. Counting results on Boolean quadratic
functions in C1 with a large value of s have been obtained in the paper [5]. Far
reaching enumeration results for the sets C1 and D have been obtained in [9,
13,14] by the use of methods originally employed in the analysis of the linear
complexity of periodic sequences, see [6].

Let us denote the number of s-plateaued quadratic functions in C1 and
D by Nn(s) and N (p)
n (s), respectively. In [13], the number Nn(s) has been
determined for n = 2m, m ≥ 1, and all possible values of s. In [14], Nn(s) and

4

Nurdag¨ul Anbar et al.

n (s) are described by the use of generating polynomials Gn(z) and G(p)

n (z),

N (p)
deﬁned by

Gn(z) =

nXt=0

Nn(n − t)zt

and G(p)

n (z) =

N (p)

n (n − t)zt .

nXt=0

In the cases of odd n and n = 2m for an odd m, the polynomial Gn(z) is
determined as a product of polynomials, see [14]. Similarly G(p)
n (z) is obtained
for n with gcd(n, p) = 1 in [3,14]. In particular, explicit formulas for the
number of bent functions in D and of semi-bent functions in C1 are given for
such n. For a result on the number of semi-bent functions in C2 we may refer
to the recent article [11]. The average behaviour of the Walsh transform of
functions in C1 and D is analysed in [9]. We remark that unlike C2, the set C1
does not contain bent functions.

In this work we present the solution of the enumeration problem in all
remaining cases, i.e., we extend the above results to functions in C1, C2, D for
arbitrary n and all possible s, by determining,

(i) the generating polynomial Gn(z) for any (even) number n,

(ii) the generating polynomial Hn(z) =Pn

(ii) the generating polynomial G(p)

n (z) for any number n, gcd(n, p) > 1.

ber Mn(s) of s-plateaued functions in C2, for any even number n, and

t=0 Mn(n−t)zt concerning the num-

We therefore completely describe the distribution of the parameter s in the
set C2, and in the sets C1 and D in all remaining cases. This also yields the
distribution of the nonlinearity in C1 and C2 in full generality. In particular,
one can obtain the number of bent functions in the sets C2 and D, or the
number of semi-bent functions in C1, C2 and D for arbitrary integers n.

Remark 1 The classes C1, C2 and D have additional properties that we ex-
plain below. A Boolean function f , deﬁned over F2n is idempotent if it satisﬁes
f (x2) = f (x) for all x ∈ F2n. The set of idempotent quadratic functions co-
incides with C1 when n is odd, and it coincides with C2 when n is even. For
an odd prime p, one can similarly deﬁne a p-potent function as a function f
from Fpn to Fp that satisﬁes f (xp) = f (x) for all x ∈ Fpn . As one would ex-
pect, the set of p-potent quadratic functions coincides with D. It is observed in
[2] that there is a nonlinearity preserving one-to-one correspondence between
the set of idempotent quadratic functions from F2n to F2 and the set of ro-
tation symmetric quadratic functions from Fn
2 to F2. (Note that only even n
is considered in [2], but the same applies to the case of odd n.) Following the
arguments of [2], one can show that this property extends to any prime p ≥ 2
and hence there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set D and the
set of rotation symmetric quadratic functions from Fn
p to Fp, which preserves
the parameter s. Hence many results on idempotent and p-potent quadratic
functions also yield results on rotation symmetric quadratic functions, which
add to the interest in the classes C1, C2 and D.

Having obtained the distribution of s in C1, C2, D, we are able to give the distri-
bution of the nonlinearity of rotation symmetric quadratic functions from Fn
2
to F2, and the distribution of the co-dimension of rotation symmetric quadratic
functions from Fn
p to Fp, for odd p. We also analyse the subcodes of the sec-
ond order Reed-Muller code obtained from C1 and C2, and present the weight
distribution for both subcodes of R(2, n).

2 Preliminaries

In this section we summarize basic tools that we use to obtain our results. We
essentially follow the notation of [13,14]. For technical reasons we include the
0-function, for which all coeﬃcients ai are zero, in all sets C1, C2 and D. Being
constant, the zero function is n-plateaued.

Let Q(x) be in C1, i.e. Q(x) = Trn(P⌊(n−1)/2⌋

ciate to Q, the polynomial

i=1

aix2i+1), ai ∈ F2. We asso-

A(x) =

⌊(n−1)/2⌋Xi=1

(aixi + aixn−i)

of degree at most n − 1. For even n we consider Q(x) ∈ C2, i.e. Q(x) =
aix2i+1) + Trn/2(an/2x2n/2+1), ai ∈ F2, and the associated poly-

Trn(P(n/2)−1

nomial

i=1

A(x) =

(aixi + aixn−i) + an/2xn/2

(n/2)−1Xi=1

of degree at most n − 1.
When p is odd and n is arbitrary we consider Q(x) ∈ D, i.e. the quadratic
i=0 aixpi+1), ai ∈ Fp, and the associated

polynomial

function of the form Q(x) = Trn(P⌊n/2⌋
⌊n/2⌋Xi=0

A(x) =

(aixi + aixn−i)

of degree at most n. With the standard Welch squaring method of the Walsh
transform, one can easily see that in all three cases, the quadratic function Q
is s-plateaued if and only if

s = deg(cid:0) gcd(xn − 1, A(x))(cid:1) ,

see also [7,10,12,15]. We observe that A(x) = xdh(x), where d is a non-negative
integer and h is a self-reciprocal polynomial of degree n − 2d. Note that d is a
positive integer in the case p = 2. When Q(x) ∈ C1 or Q(x) ∈ C2, and hence Q
is a Boolean function, the polynomial gcd(xn + 1, A(x)) is also self-reciprocal,
and A(x) can be written as

A(x) = xdf (x)g(x) ,

6

Nurdag¨ul Anbar et al.

where f is a self-reciprocal divisor of xn+1 of degree s, and g is a self-reciprocal
polynomial with degree smaller than n − s, satisfying gcd(g, (xn + 1)/f ) = 1.
When p is odd, then xn − 1 = (x − 1)ψ(x), where ψ(x) = 1 + x + · · · + xn−1 ∈
Fp[x] is self-reciprocal. Hence gcd(xn − 1, A(x)) = (x − 1)ǫf (x), ǫ ∈ {0, 1}, for
a self-reciprocal divisor f of xn − 1. Thus A(x) can be written as

A(x) = xd(x − 1)ǫf (x)g(x) ,

where g satisﬁes gcd(g, (xn − 1)/((x − 1)ǫf )) = 1.
Obviously the factorization of xn + 1 and ψ(x) into self-reciprocal factors plays
an important role. In accordance with [13,14], for a prime power q, we call a
self-reciprocal polynomial f ∈ Fq[x] prime self-reciprocal if

(i) f is irreducible over Fq, or
(ii) f = ugg∗, where g is irreducible over Fq, the polynomial g∗ 6= g is the

reciprocal of g and u ∈ F∗

q is a constant.

To analyse the factorization of xn + 1 and (xn − 1)/(x − 1) into prime self-
reciprocal polynomials, we recall the canonical factorization of xn − 1 into
irreducible polynomials. Since xn − 1 = (xm − 1)pv
if n = mpv, gcd(m, p) = 1,
we can assume that n and p are relatively prime. Let α be a primitive nth root
of unity in an extension ﬁeld of Fp, and let Cj = {jpk mod n : k ∈ N} be the
cyclotomic coset of j modulo n (relative to powers of p). Then xn − 1 ∈ Fp[x]
can be factorized into irreducible polynomials as

xn − 1 =

hYt=1

ft(x) with ft(x) = Yi∈Cjt

(x − αi),

Qi∈Cjt

where Cj1 , . . . , Cjh are the distinct cyclotomic cosets modulo n.
It is observed in [13,14] that, when p is odd, an irreducible factor ft(x) =
(x − αi) of xn − 1, diﬀerent from x − 1, is self-reciprocal if and only if
Cjt contains with i, its additive inverse −i modulo n. Otherwise there exists a
cyclotomic coset C−jt , which consists of the additive inverses of the elements
of Cjt , and the polynomial f ∗
(x − αi), which is the reciprocal
of ft. In this case ftf ∗
Most of our results are expressed in terms of the degrees of the prime self-
reciprocal factors of xn − 1. We remark that by Lemma 2 in [13], the car-
dinalities of the cyclotomic cosets modulo n, and the degrees of the prime
self-reciprocal divisors of xn − 1 can be obtained directly from the factoriza-
tion of n.

t is a prime self-reciprocal divisor of xn − 1.

t (x) =Qi∈C−jt

As explained above our aim is to determine the generating polynomials
Gn(z) and Hn(z) for even n, and G(p)
n (z) for n = pvm, v > 0. This enables us
to solve the problem of enumerating quadratic functions in the sets C1, C2 and
D with prescribed s. We adapt the number theoretical approach used in [14,
Section V], by which the generating polynomial Gn(z) is obtained to yield the
number of s-plateaued quadratic functions in C1 for the two cases; odd n and
n = 2m, where m is odd. We start by giving some deﬁnitions and lemmas.

For a (self-reciprocal) polynomial f ∈ Fp[x] we deﬁne

C(f ) := {g ∈ Fp[x] | g is self-reciprocal, deg(g) is even, and deg(g) < deg(f )} ,
K(f ) := {g ∈ C(f ) | gcd(g(x), f (x)) = 1} , and
φp(f ) := |K(f )| .

Let f be a monic self-reciprocal polynomial in Fp[x] with even degree. Let
f = re1
k be the factorization of f into distinct monic self-reciprocal
polynomials all of even degree, i.e. either r1 = (x + 1)2 and rj, 2 ≤ j ≤ k, are
prime self-reciprocal polynomials, or rj is prime self-reciprocal for all 1 ≤ j ≤
k. Then we deﬁne the (following variant of the M¨obius) function µp as

µp(f ) :=(cid:26) (−1)k if e1 = · · · = ek = 1,

otherwise.

As for the classical M¨obius function on the set of positive integers, we have

µp(d) =(cid:26) 1

if f = 1,
otherwise,

where the summation is over all monic self-reciprocal divisors d of f of even
degree.

Remark 2 Compare µp with the ”M¨obius function” used in [14], which is de-
ﬁned on the set of all self-reciprocal polynomials. Here considering the M¨obius
function on the set of self-reciprocal polynomials of even degree, where the
set of the prime elements is the union of {(x + 1)2} and the set of prime
self-reciprocal polynomials of even degree, proved to be advantageous and has
facilitated obtaining Gn(z), Hn(z) and G(p)

n (z) in full generality.

The next lemma is Lemma 8 in [14], except that the condition on a self-
reciprocal polynomial ”not to be divisible by x+1” is replaced by the condition
that it is of ”even degree”. The proof is similar to the one in [14] with this
slight modiﬁcation and hence we omit it.

whose degree is a positive even integer. Then

φp(d) = p

where the sum runs over all monic self-reciprocal divisors d of f of even degree.

The next lemma is again similar to Lemma 9 in [14], except that polynomials
involved are of even degree. We give the proof for the convenience of the reader.

Lemma 2 [14, Lemma 9] Let f, f1, f2 ∈ Fp[x] be monic self-reciprocal poly-
nomials whose degrees are positive even integers.

If gcd(f1, f2) = 1, then µp(f1f2) = µp(f1)µp(f2). Taking the summation over

where the above sum runs over all monic self-reciprocal divisors d of f of

of the values Nn(f ; t) by

Gn(f ; z) =X Nn(f ; t)zt .

We note that Gn(f ; z) is a polynomial by deﬁnition of Nn(f ; t).

The next lemma and its proof resembles Lemma 10 in [14] for p = 2.

Lemma 3 [14, Lemma 10] Let f = f1f2 for two self-reciprocal polynomials
f1, f2 of even degree. If gcd(f1, f2) = 1, then

Gn(f ; z) = Gn(f1; z)Gn(f2; z) .

Proof. We have to show that for each t ≥ 0,

Nn(f ; t) = X0≤t1≤t

Nn(f1; t1)Nn(f2; t − t1) .

For t = 0, t > deg(f ) and t odd this is trivial. Assume that 1 ≤ t ≤ deg(f ) is
even. Taking into account that φp(1) = 0, by Lemma 2(ii), and the deﬁnition
of Nn(f ; t) we obtain

3 Distribution of the nonlinearity in C1 and C2

Our aim in this section is to determine both Gn(z) and Hn(z) for all (even) in-
tegers n. By Remark 1, this does not only enable us to completely describe the
distribution of the nonlinearity for the set of idempotent quadratic Boolean
functions, but also for the set of rotation symmetric quadratic Boolean func-
tions.

We ﬁrst express our counting functions Nn(s) and Mn(s) in terms of

N (f ; t).

Proposition 1 Let n be even and let Nn(s) and Mn(s) be the number of
s-plateaued quadratic functions in C1 and C2, respectively. Then

Nn(s) = Nn(cid:18) xn + 1

(x + 1)2 ; n − s(cid:19) and Mn(s) = Nn(xn + 1; n − s) .

Proof. The statement is clear when n − s is zero or odd. Suppose n − s > 0
is even. First we consider quadratic functions Q ∈ C1. For the corresponding
associate polynomial A(x) we have gcd(A(x), xn + 1) = (x + 1)2f1(x) for some
self-reciprocal divisor f1 of (xn + 1)/(x2 + 1) of degree s − 2, i.e.

A(x) = xc(x + 1)2f1(x)g(x)

for an integer c ≥ 1 and a self-reciprocal polynomial g of even degree less than
n − s, which is relatively prime to d(x) =
(x+1)2f1(x) . In other words, g is any
of the φ2(d) polynomials in K(d). To determine the number Nn(s) we consider
all divisors (x + 1)2f1(x) of xn + 1 of degree s, or equivalently, all divisors d(x)
of (xn + 1)/(x2 + 1) of degree n − s. Hence we obtain Nn(s) as

Nn(s) =

If Q ∈ C2, then the associated polynomial A(x) satisﬁes gcd(A(x), xn + 1) =
f1(x), where f1 is a self-reciprocal polynomial of degree s, i.e.

A(x) = xcf1(x)g(x)

for an integer c ≥ 1 and a self-reciprocal polynomial g of even degree less than
n − s with gcd (g, (xn + 1)/f1(x)) = 1. Therefore g ∈ K(d). As a consequence,
the number of s-plateaued quadratic functions in C2 is

Remark 3 Putting v = 1 and m > 1 in Theorem 1, one obtains Gn(z) in
Theorem 5(ii) of [14]. Note that the Theorem 5(ii) in [14] contains an additional
factor 2, since a quadratic function there may also have a linear term. Similarly
the expression for Gn(z) with m = 1 gives Theorem 6 in [13].

As a corollary of Theorem 1 we obtain the number Mn(0) of bent functions
in the set C2 as the coeﬃcient of zn in Hn(z) for arbitrary (even) integers n.
This complements the results of [8,15], where Mn(0) has been presented for
the special cases n = 2vpr, where p is a prime such that the order of 2 modulo
p is p − 1 or (p − 1)/2.

Remark 5 To completely describe the nonlinearity distribution in C1 and C2
it is inevitable to consider the generating polynomials. Otherwise, in order to
determine Nn(s) or Mn(s) for a speciﬁc s, one would ﬁrst have to ﬁnd all
possible ways of expressing s as a sum of degrees of polynomials in the prime
self-reciprocal factorization of xn + 1, which for general n is illusive.

4 Weight distribution of subcodes of second order Reed-Muller
codes

Let Q be a set of quadratic functions, which do not contain linear or constant
terms. Assume that Q is closed under addition. Denote the set of aﬃne func-
tions from F2n to F2 by A = {Trn(bx) + c : b ∈ F2n , c ∈ F2}. Then the
set

Q ⊕ A = {Q(x) + l(x) : Q ∈ Q, l ∈ A}

gives rise to a linear subcode ¯RQ of the second order Reed-Muller code R(2, n),
which contains the ﬁrst order Reed-Muller code R(1, n) as a subcode. Clearly,
we can write Q ⊕ A as the union Q ⊕ A = ∪Q∈QQ + A of (disjoint) cosets of
A. To obtain the weight distribution of the code ¯RQ, it is suﬃcient to know
the weight distribution for each of these cosets.

It can be seen easily that the weight of the codeword cQ of a (quadratic)

function Q can be expressed in terms of the Walsh transform as

wt(cQ) = 2n−1 −

1

2bQ(0) .

For a quadratic function Q we deﬁne Qb,c(x) = Q(x) + Trn(bx + c). Using

dQb,c(0) = (−1)Trn(c)bQ(b) one can show that the weight distribution of the

coset Q + A for an s-plateaued quadratic function Q is as follows. There are

- 2n−s codewords of weight 2n−1 + 2
- 2n−s codewords of weight 2n−1 − 2
- 2n+1 − 2n−s+1 codewords of weight 2n−1.

2 −1,
2 −1, and

n+s

n+s

Hence, if one knows the number of s-plateaued quadratic functions in Q for
every s, one can determine the weight distribution of ¯RQ.
If Q is the set of all quadratic functions, then ¯RQ = R(2, n). The weight
distribution of R(2, n) is completely described in [1] by explicit, quite involved
formulas. Here we focus on the subcodes of R(2, n), obtained from the sets
C1 and C2, in other words from the set of idempotent quadratic functions.
Putting k = n − s (which is even), the observations above imply that the only
weights that can occur are 2n−1 and 2n−1 ± 2n−1− k
2 , 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Moreover,
codewords of the weights 2n−1 + 2n−1− k
2 appear the same
number of times. Hence to describe the weight distribution of the codes ¯RC we
k is the number of

i=1(cid:2)1 + (2deg(ri)/2 − 1)zdeg(ri)(cid:3) when n is odd

(see Theorem 5(i) in [14]) and Theorem 1. The formulas for AC1 and AC2 are
obtained by expanding 2n+1Gn(1) − 2Gn(2) and 2n+1Hn(1) − 2Hn(2).

Remark 6 When n is odd, the code ¯RC1 has 2(3n+1)/2 codewords, i.e. dim( ¯RC1 ) =

i=1 we conclude that ¯RC1 is

5 Enumeration of s-plateaued quadratic functions for odd
characteristic

In this section we apply our method to quadratic functions in D. Recall that
results on D translate to results on the set of rotation symmetric functions
from Fn
p to Fp. As we will see, determining the generating function in odd
characteristic is considerably more involved. We can restrict ourselves to the
case gcd(n, p) > 1 since the case gcd(n, p) = 1 is dealt with in [14] with
a diﬀerent method which employs discrete Fourier transform. We emphasize
that the method of [14] is not applicable to the case gcd(n, p) > 1.

which is a polynomial of degree at most n. We treat the cases of odd and even
n separately.

The case of odd n

In this case the factorization of xn − 1 into prime self-reciprocal divisors is
given by

xn − 1 = (x − 1)pv

1 · · · rpv
rpv
k .

Firstly we note that xn − 1 is not divisible by x + 1 as n is an odd integer, and
hence each ri, 1 ≤ i ≤ k, is a prime self-reciprocal polynomial of even degree.
Write A(x) as

A(x) =

(aixi + aixn−i) = xch(x) ,

⌊n/2⌋Xi=0

where h(x) is a self-reciprocal polynomial of degree n − 2c. Since n is odd, also
the degree of h is odd, and hence x + 1 is a factor of A(x). In fact, x + 1 must
appear as an odd power in the factorization of A(x). In particular,

A(x) = xc(x + 1)̺(x)

16

Nurdag¨ul Anbar et al.

for a self-reciprocal polynomial ̺(x) of even degree n−2c−1. As a consequence,

gcd(A(x), xn − 1) = gcd(̺(x), xn − 1) = (x − 1)ǫf1(x) ,

for a self-reciprocal polynomial f1 of even degree, and some ǫ ∈ {0, 1}. That
is,

̺(x) = (x − 1)ǫf1(x)g1(x) with gcd(cid:18)

xn − 1

(x − 1)ǫf1(x)

, g1(x)(cid:19) = 1 .

We will frequently use the following observation, which immediately follows

from the deﬁnition of φp.

Proposition 2 For a self-reciprocal polynomial d of even degree we have

φp((x ± 1)d) = φp((x ± 1)2d) .

We now represent the counting function N (p)

n (s) in terms of the function
Nn(f ; t) in (3). The arguments are more complicated than in the even char-
acteristic case, for instance, here the distinction between odd and even n is
required. As we see in the proposition below, for odd n we also need to con-
sider odd and even s separately. In the next subsection, where n is even, we
have to treat four cases.

Proposition 3 Let n be an odd integer such that the p-adic valuation of n
is vp(n) = v. The number N (p)
n (s) of quadratic s-plateaued functions in D is
given by

(x−1)pv ; n − s)

Nn( xn
Nn((x − 1)(xn − 1); n − s + 1) − Nn( xn

if s is odd,
(x−1)pv ; n − s + 1) if s is even.

−1

N (p)

n (s) = 


Proof Suppose that gcd(A(x), xn − 1) = (x − 1)f1(x), i.e. ǫ = 1. This holds if
only if s is odd. In this case, deg(g1) is odd and g1(x) is divisible by (x−1) since
̺(x) is a self-reciprocal polynomial of even degree, i.e. g1(x) = (x − 1)g(x) for
some self-reciprocal polynomial g of even degree. Furthermore we know that
(x−1)f1(x) .
gcd(
Consequently, (x − 1)pv −1 must divide f1(x). Hence h(x) can be expressed as

(x−1)f1(x) , g1(x)) = 1, and therefore x − 1 is not a factor of

xn−1

xn−1

h(x) = (x + 1)(x − 1)pv+1f (x)g(x) with gcd(cid:18)
hence g ∈ K(cid:16)

in f is even. As a result, xn−1
is divisible by x − 1, which implies that g(x) is
f (x)
not divisible by x − 1. In this case,

h(x) = (x + 1)f (x)g(x) with gcd(cid:18) xn − 1

determines f . Hence there are

ible by x − 1, and S2 is the complement, i.e.

f1(x) = (x − 1)pv−1(x + 1)pv −1f (x) for a self-reciprocal polynomial f of
even degree (which of course is a product of some ri’s). As a consequence,

h(x) = (x − 1)pv +1(x + 1)pv +1f (x)g(x) ,

for some self-reciprocal polynomial g. Note that deg(g) is an even inte-

ger smaller than n − s and gcd(cid:16)g,

such polynomials h.

(ii) Let ǫ = 1 and δ = 0, i.e., gcd(A(x), xn − 1) = gcd(h(x), xn − 1) = (x −
1)f1(x). In this case, s is odd and the self-reciprocal polynomial h of even
degree is given by

h(x) = (x − 1)f1(x)(x − 1)g(x) with gcd(cid:18)(x − 1)g(x),

xn − 1

(x − 1)f1(cid:19) = 1 ,

for some self-reciprocal polynomial g,where deg(g) is even, and smaller
than n − s. Consequently, f1(x) = (x − 1)pv−1f (x) for some self-reciprocal
polynomial f of even degree, and therefore

h(x) = (x − 1)pv+1f (x)g(x) ,

contains the factor x + 1, the
polynomial g is not divisible by x + 1. In particular, g ∈ K((x + 1)d), where

(x−1)pv f (x)(cid:17) = 1. Since xn−1

(iii) The case ǫ = 0 and δ = 1 is very similar. With the same argument as in

(ii) we get

(iv) Let ǫ = δ = 0, i.e., gcd(A(x), xn − 1) = gcd(h(x), xn − 1) = f (x) for some
self-reciprocal polynomial f of even degree. In this case we see that the
self-reciprocal polynomial h is given by

h(x) = f (x)g(x) with gcd(cid:18)g(x),

xn − 1

f (x) (cid:19) = 1 ,

where g(x) is a self-reciprocal polynomial of degree ≤ n−s. Note that xn−1
f (x)
is divisible by both x − 1 and x + 1, so g(x) is not divisible by neither.
Therefore

h(x) = f (x)g(x) with gcd(cid:18)g(x), (x − 1)(x + 1)

xn − 1

f (x) (cid:19) = 1 ,

(8)

where g(x) is a self-reciprocal polynomial of degree smaller than n − s + 2.
As for each self-reciprocal divisor d of xn − 1 of degree n − s, f is uniquely
determined, we can again express the number of polynomials h of the form
(8) in terms of φp as

(x−1)(x+1)d|(x−1)(x+1)(xn−1); deg(d)=n−s

Remark 8 From the above observations we conclude that again s ≥ pv if s is

S2 = {h : h ∈ S and (x + 1)|h}.

Note that being self-reciprocal and of even degree, the polynomials h in the
set S2 are divisible by (x + 1)2. Then for the ﬁrst sum in (9) we obtain

We set T :=P(x−1)(x+1)d|(x−1)(x+1)(xn−1); deg(d)=n−s φp((x − 1)(x + 1)d) and

in order to determine T we consider the set

S = {h(x) : h(x) is self-reciprocal, h|(x−1)(x+1)(xn−1), deg(h) = n−s+2}

and its subsets

S1 = {h(x) : h ∈ S, gcd(h, x − 1) = 1},
S2 = {h(x) : h ∈ S, gcd(h, x + 1) = 1},
S3 = {h(x) : h ∈ S, gcd(h, x2 − 1) = 1}.

Note that since h is a self-reciprocal polynomial of even degree, h is divisible
by (x ∓ 1)2 if it is divisible by x ∓ 1. As a consequence,

We also note that for h in the set S, h ∈ S1 if and only if h|(x + 1) xn−1
h ∈ S2 if and only if h|(x−1) xn−1
Therefore we can express the sum T as

Expanding, for instance from the coeﬃcient of z99 we see that the number of
81-plateaued functions in D for p = 3 and n = 9·20 is 616946472137940526877139072.
Furthermore we see that the number of bent functions in the set D is N (3)
9·20 =
6054249652811609019026768290053459869736960. Here we omit writing down
the whole expanded version of the polynomial G(3)
