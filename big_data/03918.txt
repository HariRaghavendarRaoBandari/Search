HILBERT C ∗-BIMODULES OF FINITE INDEX AND
APPROXIMATION PROPERTIES OF C ∗-ALGEBRAS

MARZIEH FOROUGH, MASSOUD AMINI

Abstract. Let A and B be arbitrary C ∗-algebras, we prove that the existence of a
Hilbert A-B-bimodule of ﬁnite index ensures that the WEP, QWEP, and LLP along
with other ﬁnite-dimensional approximation properties such as CBAP and (S)OAP are
shared by A and B. For this, we ﬁrst study the stability of the WEP, QWEP and LLP
under the Morita equivalence of C ∗-algebras.

We present examples of Hilbert A-B-bimodules which are not of ﬁnite index, while
such properties are shared between A and B. To this end, we study twisted crossed
products by amenable discrete groups.

1. Introduction

Morita equivalence between C ∗-algebras was introduced by Reiﬀel in 70’s and it has
since become a standard tool in operator algebras. Two C ∗-algebras A and B are called
(strongly) Morita equivalent if there exists an imprimitivity A-B-bimodule which is a full
left Hilbert A-module and a full right Hilbert B-module X with inner products h., .iA and
h., .iB satisfying the compatibility condition hx, yiAz = xhy, ziB, for all x, y, z ∈ X.

Motivated by the fact that the existence of an imprimitivity bimodule between two
C ∗-algebras gives an isomorphisim between their K∗-groups, the notion of Hilbert C ∗-
bimodules of ﬁnite (numerical) index was introduced in [11] and [12]. In particular, the
authors aimed to study a relation between the Jones index theory and K-theory for C ∗-
algebras. Indeed, one can consider the notion of Hilbert A-B-bimodules as a generalization
of imprimitivty bimodules by replacing the above compatibility condition by a Pimsner-
Popa type inequality. Imprimitivity bimodules are exactly the Hilbert C ∗-bimodules of
ﬁnite index such that both right and left indices are equal to the identity. Watatani
in [27] introduced and studied the conditional expectations of ﬁnite index between uni-
tal C ∗-algebras and Izumi in [8] generalized this notion to the non-unital case. Hilbert
C ∗-bimodules associated to conditional expectations of ﬁnite-index type provide typical
examples of Hilbert C ∗-bimodules of ﬁnite index.

Several properties of C ∗-algebras are known to be stable under Morita equivalence.
These include both ﬁnite-dimensional approximation properties and representation theo-
retic properties, c.f [26], [1]. Regarding Hilbert C ∗-bimodules of ﬁnite index as a gener-
alization of imprimitivity bimodules, it is natural to ask which properties of C ∗-algebras

are preserved in the presence of Hilbert C ∗-bimodules of ﬁnite index. We show that ﬁnite-
dimensional approximation properties such as nucleraity, exactness, completely bounded
approximation properties (CBAP), quasidiagonality, as well as other important related
properties like the local lifting property (LLP), weak expectation property (WEP), and
quotient of weak expectation property (QWEP) are shared between C ∗-algebras A and
B if there exists a Hilbert A-B-bimodule of ﬁnite index. For this, we ﬁrst prove the sta-
bility of the LLP, WEP, and QWEP under Morita equivalence. Moreover, we show that
the QWEP and nuclearity are preserved in the presence of Hilbert C ∗-bimodules of ﬁnite
numerical index.

On the other hand, we give examples of C ∗-algebras A and B such that there is no canon-
ical Hilbert A-B-bimodule of ﬁnite index while A and B share all the above mentioned
properties. Let G be a discrete group acting on a unital C ∗-algebra A with a normal sub-
group H. One can associate to the canonical conditional expectation E : A ⋊r G → A ⋊r H
a Hilbert C ∗-bimodule E. Then it can be concluded from [8] and [15] that the Hilbert
C ∗-bimodule E is of ﬁnite index if and only if [G : H] is ﬁnite. When G/H is amenable
then we show that A ⋊r G and A ⋊r H share nuclearity, exactness, CBAP, (S)OAP, the
WEP, QWEP and LLP, however E is not necessarily a Hilbert C ∗-bimodule of ﬁnite in-
dex. For this, we employ the notion of reduced twisted crossed products and view A ⋊r G
as a reduced twisted reduced crossed product of A ⋊r H by amenable group G/H. We
investigate the preservation of these properties under taking twisted crossed product by
amenable discrete groups. To this end, we construct approximating nets in the case of
twisted crossed products by discrete amenable groups.

We sketch the content of this paper. In section 2, we discuss the stability of several
properties of C ∗-algebras, including the WEP, QWEP and LLP by Morita equivalence.
In section 3, we ﬁrst review some basic properties of Hilbert C ∗-bimodules of ﬁnite index.
Then we prove that if there exists a Hilbert A-B-bimodule of ﬁnite index then A and B
share ﬁnite-dimensional approximation properties like nuclearity, exactness, the CBAP,
and (S)OAP along with the WEP, QWEP and LLP. Finally in section 4, we show that if a
discrete group G acts on a unital C ∗-algebra A and H is a normal co-amenable subgroup
of G, then the C ∗-algebras A ⋊r H and A ⋊r G share all the desired properties, while the
associated canonical Hilbert C ∗-bimodule may fail to be of ﬁnite index.

We use the standard notions of the theory of Hilbert C ∗-modules. Let XB be a right
Hilbert C ∗-module over a C ∗-algebra B. We denote by L(XB) the C ∗-algebra of ad-
jointable operators on XB. For x, y ∈ XB, we put θr
x,y(z) = xhy, ziB for z ∈ X and call it
a (right) rank one operator. We denote by K(XB) the C ∗-algebra generated by rank one
operators. Throughout this paper, we use the abbreviations c.p. and c.c.p. for completely
positive and contractive completely positive maps.

2. Morita Equivalence

In this section we prove that the WEP, QWEP and LLP are invariant under Morita

equivalence. To do this, we ﬁrst recall some results from [26] and [7].

In Proposition 3.3 of [26] it is shown that certain ﬁnite-dimensional approximation prop-
erties including nuclearity, exactness, CBAP, (S)OAP are stable under Morita equivalence
(for alternative proofs in the case of nuclearity and exactness, see [1] or [13]). The proof
relies on a factorization via algebras [26, Lemma 3.1], instead of ﬁnite-rank factorizations,
followed by a construction due to Blecher [5]. Indeed, we have the following criterion from
Lemma 3.1 in [26].

Lemma 2.1. Suppose that there exists an approximating net, that is, a net of c.c.p. maps
ϕi : A → Ci and ψi : Ci → A with ψi ◦ ϕi → id, in point-norm topology. Consider
the following ﬁnite-dimensional approximation properties: nuclearity, exactness, CBAP,
(S)OAP. If all Ci have any of these properties then so does A, except in the case of the
CBAP, where A has the CBAP if supΛ(Ci) ≤ ∞.

In [5], Blecher constructs completely contractive maps implementing the factorization
of a Hilbert C ∗-module X over A via the column modules A⊕n. These maps induce c.c.p.
maps on the C ∗-algebra K(X) of compact operators on X which are factored via Mn(B).
We recall the next result from [7].

Proposition 2.2. Let B be a C ∗-algebra and X be a right Hilbert C ∗-module over B.
Then there exist completely positive contractive maps ϕα : K(X) → Mn(α)(B) and ψα :
Mn(α)(B) → K(X) such that kϕαψα(x) − xk → 0, for all x ∈ K(X).

Next, we show the stability of the QWEP, LLP and WEP under Morita equivalence
of C ∗-algebras. First, we consider the case of QWEP. For this, we require the following
observation which follows from Corollary 5.3 of [21].

Lemma 2.3. Suppose that there exist c.c.p. maps ϕα : A → Ci and ψα : Ci → A such
that kϕαψα(x) − xk → 0, for all x ∈ A. If all C ∗-algebras Ci are QWEP, then so is A.

The following proposition now follows from Lemma (2.3) and Proposition (2.2).

Proposition 2.4. Let A and B are Morita equivalent C ∗-algebras. Then A is QWEP if
B is QW EP .

The Kirchberg’s tensorial characterization enables us to obtain stability of the LLP
and WEP under Morita equivalence. Recall that if A is a unital C ∗-algebra, then A has
the LLP if and only if A ⊗max B(l2) = A ⊗min B(l2) and A has the WEP if and only if
A ⊗max C ∗(F∞) = A ⊗min C ∗(F∞).

Proposition 2.5. Suppose that A and B are Morita equivalent C ∗-algebras. Then A and
B share the LLP or WEP.

Proof. It is enough to prove the assertion for the WEP. Let E be an A-B-imprimitivity
bimodule and B has the WEP. Lemma 16 of [1] implies that the algebraic tensor product
E ⊙ C ∗(F∞), where C ∗(F∞) is C ∗(F∞)-C ∗(F∞)-imprimitivity bimodule, is both a pre-
A ⊗min C ∗(F∞)-B ⊗max C ∗(F∞) and a pre-A ⊗min C ∗(F∞)-B ⊗min C ∗(F∞)-imprimitivity
bimodule. Following the argument given in the proof of Theorem 15 of [1], the maximal

4

M. FOROUGH, M. AMINI

norm of an element x ∈ A ⊗ C ∗(F∞) is the operator norm of x ∈ E ⊙ C ∗(F∞) viewed
as a right Hilbert B ⊗max C ∗(F∞)-module and its minimal norm is the operator norm of
x ∈ E ⊙ C ∗(F∞) viewed as a right Hilbert B ⊗min C ∗(F∞)-module. Since B has the WEP,
by Kirchberg’s characterization, we have kxkmax = kxkmin, i.e., the maximal and minimal
norms on A ⊙ C ∗(F∞) coincide. This completes the proof.
(cid:3)

We do not know if the local lifting property (LP) is stable under Morita equivalence,

however we can obtain the following result.

Proposition 2.6. Let A and B be Morita equivalent separable C ∗-algebras and let A have
the LP. Suppose J is any ideal of a W ∗-algebra C, then any c.c.p. map θ : B → C/J has
a c.c.p. lift.

Proof. Let θ : B → C
J be a c.c.p. map from B to a quotient of a W ∗-algebra C. The Morita
equivalence between A and B implies that there exist c.c.p. maps ϕα : B → Mn(α)(A)
and ψα : Mn(α)(A) → B such that kψαϕα(x) − xk → 0. Now consider the c.c.p. map
ϕαθ : Mn(α)(A) → C
lift σα
i.e., πσα = θψα, and so kπσαϕα(x) − θ(x)k → 0. Since C is a W ∗-algebra, we can apply
Theorem 1.3.7 of [6] to obtain a cluster point for the net of c.c.p. maps σαϕα : B → C
in the set of all bounded maps from B into C equipped with ultra-weak topology. Let
˜θ : B → C be such a cluster point, then clearly ˜θ is a c.c.p. lift for θ.
(cid:3)

J . Since Mn(α)(A) has the LP (13.2.1 of [6]), it has a c.c.p.

Recall that an aﬃrmative answer to the QWEP conjecture would imply that the LP
and the LLP are equivalent for separable C ∗-algebras ([14]). Thus by Proposition (2.5),
Morita equivalent separable C ∗-algebras share the LP if the QWEP conjecture holds.

3. Hilebrt C ∗-bimodule of finite index

We begin this section with a brief review of index theory for Hilbert C ∗-bimodules from
[12]. Let A and B be C ∗-algebras and AXB be an A-B-bimodule. We say that X is a
right Hilbert A-B-bimodule if X is a right Hilbert B-module and for all a ∈ A, the left
multiplication map φ(a) : x ∈ X 7→ ax ∈ X is adjointable, with adjoint φ(a)∗ = φ(a∗).
A left Hilbert A-B-bimodule can be deﬁned in a similar manner. An A-B-bimodule X is
called bi-Hilbertian if it is endowed with a right as well as a left Hilbert A-B-bimodule
structure such that the Banach space norms coming from the corresponding inner products
are equivalent.

Let AXB be a bi-Hilbertian C ∗-bimodule, and let λ′ ≥ 0 satisfy λ′khx, xiBk ≤ khx, xiAk,

We say that AXB is of ﬁnite left numerical index if the conjugate Hilbert A-B-bimodule

B ¯XA is of ﬁnite right numerical index.

If AXB is a bi-Hilbertian C ∗-bimodule of ﬁnite right numerical index, then there exists
a unique norm continuous map F : K(XB) → A such that F (θr
x,y) = hx, yiA. One
can uniquely extend the maps φ : A → L(XB) and F to a unital ∗-homomorphisim
φ : A∗∗ → K(XB)∗∗ and a normal positive map F ∗∗ : K(XB)∗∗ → A∗∗ between the
corresponding enveloping von Neumann algebras [12].

Deﬁnition 3.2. If AXB is of ﬁnite right numerical index, the right numerical index of
AXB, denoted by r−Ind[X], is the element F ∗∗(I) in A∗∗. If AXB is of ﬁnite left numerical
index, the left index element of X is l − Ind[X] = r − Ind[ ¯X].

Example 3.3. (c.f. Proposition 2.12 [12]) Let A ⊆ B be an inclusion of C ∗-algebras with a
conditional expectation E : B → A such that there exists λ ≥ 0 satisfying kE(b)k ≥ λkbk,
for all positive elements b ∈ B. Consider B as a Hilbert A-B-bimodule with inner products
hx, yiA = E(x∗y) and hx, yiB = xy∗. Here we shall denote this Hilbert A-B-bimodule by
E. Then by Theorem 1 of [16], there exists a λ′ such that E − λ′ is completely positive. If
one chooses the best such λ′, E is of ﬁnite right numerical index with kr − Ind[E]k = λ′−1.
Consider now BFA = B as a B-A-bimodule with inner products hx, yiB = x∗y and
hx, yiA = E(x∗y). Then by the ﬁrst part kr − Ind[F]k = 1. Note that F can be identiﬁed
by ¯E, and so kl − Ind[E]k = 1.

Theorem 3.4. Let AXB be a full Hilbert A-B-bimodule of ﬁnite right numerical index.
Assume that the right B-inner product is full and the linear span of the set of left A-inner
products is weakly dense in A∗∗. Then A is the QWEP or nuclear if so is B.

Proof. Note that both nuclearity and the QWEP are preserved under Morita equivalence
and taking double dual. Since the right B-inner product is full, B and K(XB) are Morita
equivalent. Hence K(XB)∗∗ is the QWEP or nuclear if so is B. Suppose that AXB is of
ﬁnite numerical index then Proposition 2.19 of [12] ensures the existence of a conditional
expectation E : K(XB)∗∗ → q∗∗(A∗∗). Now by Corollary 2.20 of [12], φ∗∗ is faithful
since we assume that the linear span of the set of left A-inner products is weakly dense.
This completes the proof since nuclearity and the QWEP pass to a C ∗-subalgebra in the
presence of a condition expectation.
(cid:3)

Corollary 3.5. Let AXB be a full Hilbert A-B-bimodule of ﬁnite numerical index. Then
A and B share the QWEP and nuclearity.

Corollary 3.6. Let A ⊆ B be an inclusion of C ∗-algebras and E : B → A be a conditional
expectation of ﬁnite Pimsner-Popa index. Then A is nuclear or QW EP if and only if B
is so.

Let us recall the deﬁnition of Hilbert C ∗-bimodules of ﬁnite index from [12].

Deﬁnition 3.7. A bi-Hilbertian A-B-bimodule AXB is called of ﬁnite right index if
(i) X is of ﬁnite right numerical index,
(ii) r − Ind[X] ∈ M (A).

6

M. FOROUGH, M. AMINI

Similarly, X is of ﬁnite left index if the conjugate Hilbert A-B-bimodule B ¯XA is of ﬁnite
right index. The module AXB is called of ﬁnite index if it is of ﬁnite right as well as ﬁnite
left indices.

Example 3.8. (i) Let A ⊆ B be an inclusion of C ∗-algebras with a conditional expectation
E : B → A of ﬁnite-type index in the sense of Izumi [8]. By Example (3.8), one can
associate a Hilbert A-B-bimodule E to the conditional expectation E. Then E is a Hilbert
A-B-bimodule of ﬁnite index.
(ii) (c.f. Proposition 1.8 of [10]) Let X be a Hilbert A-B-bimodule of ﬁnite index, G
be a countable discrete group, and (A, B, X, G, α, β, γ) be a G-equivariant system. Then
X ⋊γ G is a Hilbert A ⋊α G-B ⋊β G-bimodule of ﬁnite index. The same statement also
holds for the reduced crossed products.

Theorem 3.9. Let A and B be C ∗-algebras and AXB be a Hilbert C ∗-bimodule of ﬁnite
right index such that both left and right inner products are full. Then the following prop-
erties pass from B to A: nuclearity, exactness, CBAP, (S)OAP, WEP, LLP, and QWEP.
Moreover, if A and B are separable, they also share quasidiagonality.

Proof. First observe that all the above properties are preserved under Morita equivalence.
Also note that the fullness of right inner product implies that B and K(X) are Morita
equivalent. Thus K(XB) has any of the above properties if so does B. Moreover, since we
assume that AXB is of ﬁnite right index, there is a conditional expectation E : K(XB) →
φ(A) by Corollary 2.28 [12]. Hence all of the properties pass from K(XB) to φ(A). On
the other hand φ is faithful again by the above result in [12], since we assume that the left
inner product is full, and this completes the proof.
(cid:3)

Corollary 3.10. Let A and B be C ∗-algebras and AXB be a Hilbert C ∗-bimodule of ﬁnite
index such that both left and right inner products are full. Then A and B share the following
properties: nuclearity, exactness, CBAP, (S)OAP, WEP, LLP, and QWEP. Moreover, if
A and B are separable, they also share quasidiagonality.

We Recall that in the case of the inclunion of unital C ∗-algebras A ⊆ B with a con-
ditional expectation of ﬁnite index, it has been shown that the following properties are
shared between A and B: simplicity, self-absorption, the cancelation property, stable rank,
nuclear dimension, see [8, 19, 20, 18, 24].

Corollary 3.11. Let A ⊆ B be an inclusion of C ∗-algebras and E : B → A be a conditional
expectation of ﬁnite-index type. Then A and B share all the properties in Theorem (3.9).

Let α be an action of a ﬁnite group G on a C ∗-algebra A. In [22], some conditions are
presented under which the following properties passes from A to the ﬁxed point algebra Aα:
the ideal property, the projection property, topological dimension zero, and pure ﬁniteness.
Now, from we can deduce a suﬃcient conditions under which any of the properties passes
from A into the ﬁxed point algebra Aα.

Corollary 3.12. Let α be a saturated action of a ﬁnite group G on a unital C ∗-algebra
A, then A has any of the properties if and only if the ﬁxed point algebra Aα enjoys the
same property.

Proof. By Proposition 2.8.6 of [27], the canonical conditional expectation from A onto Aα
is of ﬁnite-index type. Thus Corollary (3.11) implies the result.
(cid:3)

The following corollary is immediate from Example (3.8) and Corollary (3.11).

Corollary 3.13. Suppose that G is a discrete group acting on a unital C ∗-algebra B and
let E : B → A be a ﬁnite-index type conditional expectation from B onto a unital C ∗-
subalgebra A commutating with the action of G. Then A ⋊r G and B ⋊r G share all the
above properties. The same holds for the full crossed products.

4. Inclusions of crossed products

In this section, we give an example of two C ∗-algebras A and B sharing the properties
nuclearity, exactness, CBAP, (S)OAP, the LLP, WEP, and QWEP, while the canonical
Hilbert A-B-bimodule is not of ﬁnite index.

Let α be an action of a discrete group G on a unital C ∗-algebra A, and H be a normal
subgroup of G. We recall from [15] that there is a natural conditional expectation E
from A ⋊α,r G onto the C ∗-subalgebra A ⋊α,r H such that E(aus) = aus if s ∈ H and
E(aus) = 0, otherwise. Moreover, by Theorem 2.8 of [15], the conditional expectation
E is of ﬁnite-index type if and only if [G : H] is ﬁnite. So by part (i) of Example (3.8)
the Hilbert A ⋊α,r G − A ⋊α,r H-bimodule E is of ﬁnite index if and only if [G : H] is
ﬁnite.
In this case, A ⋊α,r H and A ⋊α,r G share all of the properties mentioned in
Theorem (3.9). We show that this also happens when G/H is amenable, while the Hilbert
A ⋊α,r G − A ⋊α,r H-bimodule E is not necessarily of ﬁnite index. To do this, we need
the notion of the reduced twisted crossed product and stability of nuclearity, exactness,
CBAP, (S)OAP, LLP, WEP and QWEP by taking reduced twisted crossed product by
amenable discrete groups.

Let A be a unital C ∗-algebra and let G be a discrete group. A twisted action of G on

A is a pair (α, u) where α : G → Aut(A) and u : G × G → U (A) satisfy

(i) αs ◦ αt = Ad(u(s, t))αst,
(ii) αr(u(s, t))u(r, st) = u(r, s)u(rs, t),
(iii) u(1, s) = u(s, 1) = 1,

for all s, t, r ∈ G. We shall refer to the quadruple (A, G, α, u) as a twisted C ∗-dynamical
system.

Following [3], one can construct the full and reduced twisted crossed products A⋊(α,u) G
and A ⋊
(α,u),r G. To deﬁne the reduced twisted crossed product for a twisted dynamical
system (A, G, α, u) we consider the following covariant pair of representations: λu : G →
U (l2(G, H)) deﬁned by λu(s)(ξ)(l) = u(l−1, s)ξ(s−1l) and πα : A → U (l2(G, H)) deﬁned
by (πα(x))(ξ)(l) = αl−1(x)(ξ)(l).

The next lemma should be well-known but we could not ﬁnd a reference. For the sake

of completeness, we give a proof here.

Lemma 4.1. The reduced twisted crossed product A ⋊(α,u),r G does not depend on the
choice of the faithful representation A ⊆ B(H).

Proof. Let {δg, g ∈ G} be the canonical orthogonal basis for l2(G) and for any ﬁnite set
F ⊆ G let P ∈ B(l2(G)) be the orthogonal projection onto the linear span of {δg, g ∈
F }. Suppose (ep,q)p,q∈F be the canonical matrix unit of P B(l2(G))P ∼= MF (C).
It is
straightforward to check that

(1 ⊗ P )πα(a)(1 ⊗ P ) = (1 ⊗ P )πα(a) = X
q∈F

αq−1(a) ⊗ eq,q

and

(1 ⊗ P )λu(s)(1 ⊗ P ) = X
p∈F

u(p−1, s) ⊗ ep,s−1p.

Therefore, if x = Ps asλu(s) ∈ Cc(G, A) ⊆ B(H ⊗ l2(G), then, in A ⊗ MF (C), we have

(1 ⊗ P )(X

s

πα(a)λu(s))(1 ⊗ P ) = X
p∈F ∩sF

αq−1(a)u(p−1, s) ⊗ ep,s−1p.

Now, the result follows by an argument as in the proof of Proposition 4.5.1 of [6]. (cid:3)

Next we investigate the stability of the properties considered in Theorem (3.9) under
taking reduced twisted crossed product by amenable discrete groups. First we consider the
ﬁnite-dimensional approximation properties and the QWEP. For this, we use the criterion
given in Lemma 3.1 of [26]. To this end, inspired by Lemma 4.2.3 of [6], we construct an
approximating net for the twisted reduced crossed product by amenable discrete groups.
First, we need the following lemmas.

Lemma 4.2. Let (α, u) be a twisted action of a discrete group G on a unital C ∗-algebra
A with u(s, s−1) = u(s−1, s) = 1 and let ι be the trivial action of G on a unital C ∗-algebra
B. Then,

(i) Suppose (α⊗ι, u⊗1) is the twisted action of G on A⊗B satisfying (α⊗ι)(g)(a⊗b) =

α(g)a ⊗ b. Then

(A ⋊(α,u),r G) ⊗ B = (A ⊗ B) ⋊(α⊗ι,u⋊1),r G.

(ii) Suppose (α ⊗max ι, u ⊗ 1) is the twisted action of G on A ⊗max B satisfying (α ⊗max

ι)(g)(a ⊗ b) = α(g)a ⊗ b. Then

(A ⋊

(α,u) G) ⊗ B = (A ⊗max B) ⋊

(α⊗maxι,u⋊1) G.

Proof. The proof is similar to the non-twisted case, see [28].

(cid:3)

By a modiﬁcation of Lemma 4.2.3 in [6], we construct an approximating net in the

twisted case.

Lemma 4.3. Let (A, G, α, u) be a twisted C ∗-dynamical system with u(s, s−1) = u(s−1, s) =
1. Suppose that F ⊂ G is a ﬁnite set, then there exist c.c.p. maps φ : A⋊
(α,u),rG → A⊗Mn
and ψ : A ⊗ Mn → A ⋊

(α,u),r G such that ψφ(πα(a)λu(s)) = |F ∩sF |

|F | πα(a)λu(s).

Proof. Deﬁne the c.c.p. map

φ : A ⋊α,u G → A ⊗ Mn,

Now, the required stability is concluded by the approximation nets constructed in the

previous lemma.

Proposition 4.4. Let (α, u) be a twisted action of amenable discrete group G on a unital
C ∗-algebra A with u(s, s−1) = u(s−1, s) = 1. Then A and A ⋊(α,u),r G share any of the
following properties: nuclearrity, exactness, CBAP, (S)OAP and the QWEP.

Proof. Let {Fα} be a Folner sequence for amenable group G and φα : A ⋊(α,u),r G →
A⊗Mn(α) and ψα : A⊗Mn(α) → A⋊
(α,u),r G be the corresponding c.c.p. maps constructed
in Lemma (4.3) such that

kψαφα(x) − xk → 0,

for any x ∈ A ⋊α,u G. Then A and A ⊗ Mn(α) share all of the above properties. Therefore,
the result is immediate by Lemma 3.1 of [26] and Lemma (4.3).

The Kirchberg’s tensorial characterization of the LLP and WEP enables us to employ
the argument given in Theorem 2.1 of [4] to obtain the stability of the LLP and WEP
under taking twisted reduced products by amenable discrete groups. For this, we ﬁrst
need the following lemma, which can be proved as Theorem 4.2.4 of [6].

Lemma 4.5. Let A be a unital C ∗-algebra and α be an action of discrete amenable group
G on A then A ⋊(α,u) G and A ⋊(α,u),r G are naturally ∗-isomorphism.

Proposition 4.6. Let (α, u) be a twisted action of amenable discrete group G on a unital
C ∗-algebra A with u(s, s−1) = u(s−1, s) = 1. Suppose that A has the LLP or WEP then
A ⋊

(α,u),r G has that property.

Proof. We need only to prove the statement for the WEP. Assume that A has the WEP,
then by Kirchberg’s criterion, Lemma (4.5) and Proposition (4.2) we have

(A ⋊

(α,u) G) ⊗ C ∗(F∞) = (A ⋊

(α,u),r G) ⊗ C ∗(F∞)
(α⊗ι),r G

= (A ⊗ C ∗(F∞)) ⋊
= (A ⊗max C ∗(F∞)) ⋊
(α⊗maxι),r G
= (A ⊗max C ∗(F∞)) ⋊(α⊗maxι) G
= (A ⋊(α,u) G) ⊗max C ∗(F∞).

Now employ Kirchberg’s characterization to conclude that A ⋊(α,u),r G has the WEP. (cid:3)

Before stating the main result of this section, we need the following proposition which

is analogous to Proposition 3 of [3] for von Neumann algebra crossed products.

Proposition 4.7. Let 1 → H → G → Q → 1 be an exact sequence of discrete groups and
α be an action of a discrete group G on a unital C ∗-algebra A. Then there exists a twisted
α|H ,r H with u(s, s−1) = u(s−1, s) = 1 for all s ∈ G, such that
action (β, u) of Q on A ⋊
A ⋊α,r G is ∗-isomorphic to (A ⋊α|H ,r H) ⋊β,u Q.

Now, we are ready to state our main result of this section.

Theorem 4.8. Let 1 → H → G → Q → 1 be an exact sequence of discrete groups with Q
amenable and α be an action of G on a unital C ∗-algebra A. Then A ⋊α,r G has any of
the properties mentioned in Theorem (3.9) if and only if A ⋊α|H ,r H has that property.

Proof. The existence of a conditional expectation from A ⋊α,r G onto A ⋊α|H ,r H ensures
that if A ⋊α,r G has any of the above properties then A ⋊α,r G has that property. For the
other direction, ﬁrst note that by Proposition (4.7), there exists a twisted action (β, u) of
Q on A ⋊
α|H ,r H) ⋊β,u Q. Therefore,
it is enough to use Propositions (4.4), (4.6) and (4.7) to obtain the desired result.
(cid:3)

α|H ,r H such that A ⋊α,r G is ∗-isomorphic to (A ⋊

Let H be a normal subgroup of a discrete group G with G/H amenable. Then Theorem
(4.7) adds the LLP, WEP and QWEP to the already known list of ﬁnite-dimensional
approximation properties shared between C ∗

r (G) and C ∗

r (H).
