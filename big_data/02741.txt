Electromagnetic form factors of the baryon octet are studied using a Nambu–Jona-Lasinio model
which utilizes the proper-time regularization scheme to simulate aspects of colour conﬁnement. In
addition, the model also incorporates corrections to the dressed quarks from vector meson correlations
in the t-channel and the pion cloud. Comparison with recent chiral extrapolations of lattice QCD
results shows a remarkable level of consistency. For the charge radii we ﬁnd the surprising result

INTRODUCTION

The lowest mass baryon octet plays a special role in
the quest to understand the strong interaction. Along
with their masses and axial charges, it is particularly
important to explain their distributions of charge and
magnetisation in terms of the underlying quark-gluon
dynamics. Empirically, these distributions are expressed
by their electromagnetic form factors, which present an
extraordinary challenge for QCD [1]. Considerable exper-
imental eﬀort has been devoted to the measurement and
parametrization of the electromagnetic form factors of
the nucleon [2–13]. However, for the other members of
the baryon octet this is a more diﬃcult task because of
their short lifetimes [14].

Theoretical predictions for nucleon electromagnetic
form factors, and for example, parton distribution func-
tions, have been made using a variety of approaches,
such as quark models [15–26], QCD sum rules [27], the
Dyson-Schwinger equations [28–30] and lattice QCD sim-
ulations [31–39]. For the other elements of the octet, prior
to lattice QCD computations, early work on the spectrum,
electromagnetic form factors and weak form factors was
based on, for example, the bag model [40–51], QCD sum
rules [27], constituent quark models [52–54] and more
recently the Dyson-Schwinger equations [55].

With the advent of more precise lattice QCD computa-
tions, together with chiral extrapolations to the physical
point, the baryon octet spectrum has been accurately
reproduced [32, 35, 56] and more recently the electromag-
netic form factors of the outer ring of the octet have been
extracted [38, 39]. At the same time, the recent work
in Ref. [26] showed promising results when the Nambu–
Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model [57, 58] was applied to the cal-
culation of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors [26].
In addition, the model has also been applied to the ax-
ial charges in several ∆S = 0 β-decays in the baryon
octet [54], and the electromagnetic form factors of the ρ
meson [59].

In the present work we extend the framework devel-
oped in Ref. [26] for the nucleon, to a description of the
electromagnetic form factors of the baryon octet.

MODEL

Extensive reviews of the NJL model exist [61, 62, 67]
and here we use the SU (3) ﬂavour version with only
the four-fermion interaction. The Lagrangian in the ¯qq
interaction channel, which we take in Fierz symmetric
form [61], reads

absent in the NJL model and therefore one must specify a
method of regularization. We use the proper-time scheme,
because it simulates aspects of quark conﬁnement [63–65].
The dressed quark mass, Mq, of ﬂavour q = u, d, s is
obtained by solving the gap equation. With proper-time
regularization Mq satisﬁes [54]

We note that in the SU (3) ﬂavour case, ﬂavour mixing is
absent, in contrast to the SU (2) ﬂavour case [61].

When solving the 3-body problem [66] in the NJL
model, to obtain the Faddeev vertex functions for each
member of the baryon octet, strong diquark correlations
naturally appear. To determine the diquark t-matrices
it is therefore convenient to make a diﬀerent Fierz trans-
formation on the SU (3) NJL Lagrangian density, which
yields the eﬀective qq interactions [68] in the scalar and

whose solution gives the mass and vertex function for each
member of the baryon octet.

Solutions to the Faddeev equation for each member of
the baryon octet in this model have already been detailed
in Ref. [54], therefore here we will just give a brief re-
view. For each baryon the Faddeev equation, in the static
approximation [71], takes the general form

Γb(p, s) = Zb Πb(p) Γb(p, s),

(10)

where b = N, Σ, Ξ labels the baryon and the p2 that
satisﬁes this equation deﬁnes the baryon mass. The quark
exchange kernel is labelled by Zb and Πb(p) contains the
quark–diquark bubble diagrams. The Faddeev vertex is

normalized such that Γb(p, s) = √−Zb Γ0b(p, s), where
Zb is given by

We normalize the vertex Γ0b(p, s) such that Γ0b Γ0b = 1.
For the form factor calculations we will only consider
the nucleon, Σ± and Ξ, as there are no lattice results
for the Λ and the Σ0. The Faddeev vertex functions are
evaluated for equal light quark masses (Mu = Md ≡ M(cid:96))
and for the members of the baryon octet considered, the

and we choose ΛIR = 0.240 GeV. The masses of the light
dressed quarks are chosen as Mu = Md = M(cid:96) = 0.4 GeV,
while the s-quark mass, Ms, is chosen to reproduce the
mass of the Ω− baryon. The parameters ΛU V , Gπ and
Gρ are ﬁt to reproduce the empirical values of the pion
decay constant, and the pion and ρ masses, while Ga and
Gs are ﬁxed by the physical ∆++ and nucleon masses.

In Tab. II we summarize the results for the diquark
masses, as well as the residues for the diquark t-matrices
given in Eqs. (8) and (9). The octet baryon masses,
obtained by solving the appropriate Faddeev equation,
are given in Tab. III. The parameters deﬁning the Faddeev
vertex function for each member of the baryon octet are
summarized in Tab. IV.

octet baryon b, are deﬁned by the electromagnetic current

where Q2 = −q2. In the NJL model considered here, this
electromagnetic current is represented by the Feynman
diagrams illustrated in Fig. 3.

In the evaluation of the baryon form factors we dress
the quark-photon vertices by including both vector meson
correlations in the t-channel, through the inhomogeneous
BSE, and also eﬀects from pion loops. This formalism is
described in detail in Ref. [26]. In summary, the dressed
quark-photon vertex has the form:

erated by t-channel φ meson correlations [26]. Because
the π is much lighter than the K we expect pion loops to
give the dominant chiral correction, and therefore omit
K loops [60].

Table V. Magnetic moments in units of nuclear magnetons.
The BSE results include only the vector meson contributions
to the dressed quark form factors, while the ﬁnal results also
include eﬀects from the pion cloud. A comparison with the
experimental values [14] is shown.

results include both BSE and the eﬀect of the pion cloud.

cloud as well. It is evident that the eﬀect of the pion cloud
is to increase the magnitude of the magnetic moments
across the octet, almost uniformly improving agreement
with experiment. The exception is the Σ−, where the
discrepancy is about 40%, which suggests that in this case
the eﬀect of the pion cloud may be overestimated [49, 50].
Results for the charge and magnetic radii of the octet
baryons, deﬁned with respect to the Sachs form factors,
are summarized in Tab. VI. The PL column stands for a
structureless, point-like quark and the other two columns
use either the BSE or the fully dressed quark-photon
vertex. The eﬀect of the vector meson and pion cloud
dressing on these quantities is evident. In all cases the
radii increase with the inclusion of vector meson correc-
tions, sometimes dramatically. The eﬀect of the pion
cloud alone is also to increase the radii, except for the
−
Ξ−, where rΞ
M is reduced from 0.62 fm with only the BSE
vertex to 0.51 fm including the pion cloud. The maximum
contribution appears in the neutron charge radius where
we ﬁnd an increase of 85% from the pion cloud alone.
The smallest contribution of the pion cloud occurs for
the magnetic radius of the Ξ0 and Ξ−, which is to be
expected because the strange quarks do not couple to the
pion cloud.

E < rΣ+

E and |rn

Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that rp

E| < |rΞ0
E |.
This is because the diﬀerence between mρ(ω) and mφ
(about 250 MeV), which characterize the vector meson
dressing of the quark-photon vertices, makes the slope
of F1D at Q2 = 0 around 1.78 times larger than that for
F1S in the BSE case, and 2.45 times larger including the
pion cloud. The contributions from these form factors
tend to lower the charge radius, suppressing rE more in
the nucleon than in the Σ+ or Ξ0. In addition, for the
proton the term arising from the F2D form factor reduces
the proton radius even further, and this term is absent in
the Σ+ because the strange quark does not couple to the
pion ﬁeld.

Our main results, presented in Fig. 4, compare the
octet form factors calculated here with those obtained
in Ref. [38, 39] via chiral extrapolation of lattice QCD
simulations (on two diﬀerent volumes) to the physical
quark masses. For the magnetic form factors of the neu-
tron, Σ− and Ξ− it is evident the contribution from the

pion cloud is signiﬁcant, primarily at low Q2. The eﬀect
of the pion cloud on the nucleon electric form factors
appears to improve the agreement with the lattice sim-
ulations (which are in quite good agreement with the
empirical data), whereas the magnetic form factors are
still underestimated.

The other members of the octet appear to have a similar
behaviour. However, for the Σ− the curvature of GM is
dramatically increased by the pion cloud. This behaviour
matches the large increase of the Σ− magnetic moment
−
reported earlier. GΣ
E is consistent with the lattice results
within the same level of accuracy found for the nucleon,
−
Σ+ and Ξ0. Finally, GΞ
M shows outstanding agreement
−
with the lattice data but GΞ
E is above the data, just as
found for the other members of the octet.

The possible explanation of these small, but non-
negligible diﬀerences could well be a consequence of the
fact that there are still systematic errors from the lattice
simulation and the chiral extrapolation technique.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a study of the electromagnetic form
factors of the baryon octet over an extended range of mo-
mentum transfer. The calculations were made within the
NJL model, using proper-time regularization to simulate
conﬁnement and included dressing at the quark-photon
vertices from vector mesons and pion loops. This work
was stimulated by the recent lattice QCD calculations
of these quantities, which presented results (after chiral
extrapolation) at a discrete set of values of Q2 up to 1.4
GeV2. In comparing the model calculations with these
lattice results one must bear in mind that there may
still be systematic errors at the level of 10% arising from
lattice artifacts as well as the chiral extrapolation.

Overall, the level of agreement between the model cal-
culations and the lattice results is qualitatively impressive.
We expect that the results presented here will stimulate
calculations in other approaches and trust that the com-
parison between those results, future lattice calculations
and the results presented here will indeed lead to impor-
tant new insights into hadron structure.
