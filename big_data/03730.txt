Abstract

We develop a frame-covariant formulation of inﬂation in the slow-roll approximation by generalizing
the inﬂationary attractor solution for scalar-curvature theories. Our formulation gives rise to new
generalized forms for the potential slow-roll parameters, which enable us to examine the eﬀect
of conformal transformations and inﬂaton reparameterizations in scalar-curvature theories. We
ﬁnd that cosmological observables, such as the power spectrum, the spectral indices and their
runnings, can be expressed in a concise manner in terms of the generalized potential slow-roll
parameters which depend on the scalar-curvature coupling function, the inﬂaton wavefunction,
and the inﬂaton potential. We show how the cosmological observables of inﬂation are frame-
invariant in this generalized potential slow-roll formalism, as long as the end-of-inﬂation condition is
appropriately extended to become frame-invariant as well. We then apply our formalism to speciﬁc
scenarios, such as the induced gravity inﬂation, Higgs inﬂation and F (R) models of inﬂation, and
obtain more accurate results, without making additional approximations to the potential. Our
results are shown to be consistent to lowest order with those presented in the literature. Finally,
we outline how our frame-covariant formalism can be naturally extended beyond the tree-level
approximation, within the framework of the Vilkovisky–DeWitt eﬀective action.

1. Introduction

Inﬂation, which was originally proposed as a solution to the ﬂatness and horizon problems
[1, 2], has been found to be an excellent generic explanation to the origin of anisotropies
observed in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) [3–6]. However, the large number
of inﬂationary models underpinned by a variety of theoretical ideas, such as quintessence,
modiﬁed gravity and string theory, poses a challenge in determining the physical driving
mechanism for inﬂation. Furthermore, due to the complexity of the equations of motion
in many inﬂationary models, extracting analytical predictions for cosmological observables
of inﬂation is rapidly becoming a formidable task. In the simplest of inﬂationary models,
it has been found that if the equations of motion for the classical perturbations of the
metric and the inﬂaton are quantized, the observed tilt of the CMB can be found in terms of
solutions to the classical equations of motion. To analytically investigate inﬂationary models
in the general case, the standard procedure is to assume that these solutions satisfy a set of
constraints known collectively as the slow-roll approximation. In this paradigm, the inﬂaton
ﬁeld ϕ is assumed to slowly roll down the inﬂationary potential V (ϕ), meaning that we
may neglect several terms in the equations of motion. Consequently, it is possible to obtain
simple analytical expressions for the tilt of the CMB and other inﬂationary observables.

As observations impose increasingly tighter constraints on inﬂation [7, 8], it becomes
diﬃcult to physically motivate minimally coupled inﬂationary models with acceptable phe-
nomenology both in the context of particle physics and cosmology. A popular alternative is to
introduce a coupling function f (ϕ) between the scalar curvature R and the inﬂaton ϕ, leading
to a more general class of gravity models, termed scalar-curvature theories. In these theories,
such a coupling function may also be motivated by viewing it as emerging from quantum
corrections to the low-energy eﬀective action, after integrating out high-energy degrees of
freedom. Thus, it is desirable to extend the procedure for extracting observable quantities
from minimally coupled models, in which f (ϕ) = M 2
P where MP = 2.435 × 1018 GeV is the
reduced Planck mass, to general scalar-curvature models, in which f (ϕ) is an arbitrary func-
tion of ϕ. Moreover, scalar-curvature theories with a non-trivial scalar-curvature coupling
f (ϕ), which are said to be in the Jordan frame, can be recast in the Einstein frame, and so
be written in terms of minimally coupled models via a combination of conformal transfor-
mations and inﬂaton ﬁeld reparameterizations. Consequently, studying models related by
these transformations can help resolve the so-called frame problem, namely whether these
models are physically equivalent or not [9–15].

The aim of the present article is to introduce frame covariance in the inﬂationary dynam-
ics of scalar-curvature theories. This covariance manifests itself as a set of transformation
rules that nonetheless keep cosmological observables of inﬂation invariant. To this end, we
develop a new formalism for extracting predictions for observable quantities from scalar-
curvature theories by generalizing the corresponding well-known potential slow-roll approx-
imation used in minimally-coupled models. Using this formalism, it is possible to study
classes of scalar-curvature theories related to one another by conformal transformations and
inﬂaton ﬁeld reparameterizations independently. Hence, we will show that these classes of

2

models generate equivalent predictions for inﬂationary observables. Furthermore, the new
formalism may be used as a calculational tool for extracting predictions in a concise and
intuitive manner for a wide range of scalar-curvature models without the need for further
approximations beyond the ones established in the slow-roll approximation.

The outline of this paper is as follows: after this introductory section, Section 2 intro-
duces the classical action S of the scalar-curvature theories that we will be considering. In
particular, we specify each theory by three model functions [cf. (2.1)]: (i) the non-minimal
scalar-curvature coupling f (ϕ), (ii) the non-canonical inﬂaton-dependent wavefunction k(ϕ),
and (iii) the inﬂaton potential V (ϕ). We introduce conformal transformations and inﬂaton
reparameterizations and, by observing that the classical action of the theory is invariant
under their combined action, we derive the transformation properties of the three model
functions mentioned above.

In Section 3, we derive the modiﬁed Einstein ﬁeld equations for scalar-curvature theories
by varying the action with respect to the metric gµν and the inﬂaton ﬁeld ϕ. We fur-
ther simplify the cosmological equations of motion by considering a Friedman–Robertson–
Walker (FRW) metric with a general lapse function NL and a homogeneous inﬂaton. We
observe that the form of the acceleration, Friedman, and continuity equations does not alter,
as long as the energy density and pressure are replaced by new, modiﬁed variables given in
terms of the model functions.

In Section 4, we perturb the metric to ﬁrst order, which allows us to consider separately
scalar, vector, and tensor perturbations. We then introduce the comoving curvature per-
turbation as the primordial origin of scalar perturbation modes and the polarizations of the
gravitational waves as the primordial tensor perturbation modes. After quantizing these
perturbations, we write down their two-point correlation functions and relate the latter to
the scalar and tensor power spectra PR and PT . In this way, we introduce the commonly
used inﬂationary observables in terms of PR and PT , which include the scalar and tensor
spectral indices nR and nT , the tensor-to-scalar ratio r, and the runnings of the spectral
indices αR and αT .

In Section 5, we introduce the slow-roll approximation by deﬁning the Hubble slow-roll
parameters, which allow us to neglect certain terms in the equations of motion and control
the validity of the approximation. However, the presence of a non-trivial non-minimal
coupling f (ϕ) is found to introduce two extra slow-roll parameters in addition to those
present in minimally-coupled models of inﬂation. After writing the inﬂationary observables
mentioned above and the cosmological equations of motion in terms of the Hubble slow-roll
parameters, we derive the generalized solution for the inﬂationary attractor. This enables
us to deﬁne new potential slow-roll parameters, purely in terms of f (ϕ), k(ϕ) and V (ϕ),
which reduce to the Hubble slow-roll parameters in the slow-roll approximation. Hence, we
derive explicit expressions for the inﬂationary observables in a straightforward manner for
any scalar-curvature theory using only the expressions of the model functions, thus avoiding
the intermediate step of having to solve the equations of motion.

In Section 6, we examine the diﬀerent frames that may occur in inﬂationary dynamics

3

and derive the transformation properties of the generalized potential slow-roll parameters.
By virtue of these parameters, we show that cosmological observables of inﬂation are frame-
independent when expressed in terms of the inﬂaton ϕ to ﬁrst order in the slow-roll approx-
imation. Instead, the number of e-folds, commonly used in the literature to express analytic
predictions for inﬂationary observables, is found to be frame-dependent. However, in our
generalized approach, the end-of-inﬂation condition may be uniquely extended, so that it
becomes frame-independent and reduces to the usual condition for the Einstein frame, thus
leaving observables expressed in terms of e-folds frame-invariant.

In Section 7, we consider three speciﬁc models of inﬂation: (i) induced gravity inﬂation,
(ii) Higgs inﬂation, and (iii) F (R) theories. In induced gravity inﬂation, the eﬀective Planck
mass is fully induced by the inﬂaton. We distinguish between small-ﬁeld and large-ﬁeld in-
duced gravity inﬂation and derive expressions for the cosmological observables in both cases.
We then proceed similarly in Higgs inﬂation, which contains a non-minimal coupling that
modiﬁes, but not fully dominates the eﬀective Planck mass. By analogy, we derive expres-
sions for all cosmological observables of inﬂation and evaluate the size of the non-minimal
coupling through the normalization of the power spectrum.
In all cases, the expressions
for the cosmological observables reduce to the ones found in the literature to lowest order.
Finally, we consider a slightly diﬀerent class of theories, the so-called F (R) models, where
inﬂation is driven by a modiﬁcation to the Einstein–Hilbert action. Using an auxiliary ﬁeld,
we recast these models in terms of scalar-curvature models, and so obtain predictions for a
Starobinsky-like model, for which F (R) = αR + βnRn.

In Section 8, we outline how our frame-covariant formalism can be extended beyond
the tree-level approximation, within the framework of the Vilkovisky–DeWitt eﬀective ac-
tion [16, 17]. Our explicit demonstration will be at the one-loop level, thus making plausible
its applicability to higher orders. Finally, Section 9 summarizes our conclusions and presents
possible future directions along the frame-covariant formalism for inﬂation that we are study-
ing. Technical details related to the transformation properties of the model functions are
given in Appendix A.

2. Scalar-Curvature Theories and Frame Transformations

In this section, we deﬁne the classical action S describing the inﬂationary dynamics in
scalar-curvature theories. The invariance of S under conformal rescalings of the metric gµν
and reparameterizations of the inﬂaton ﬁeld ϕ will help us to introduce the concept of frame
transformations.

For simplicity, let us assume that the energy densities of all other ﬁelds are suﬃciently
diluted with respect to the energy density of the inﬂaton, such that there is no contribution
to the Lagrangian from hydrodynamic matter. With this assumption, we may deﬁne the
classical action S for a wide class of scalar-curvature theories as

S[gµν, ϕ, f (ϕ), k(ϕ), V (ϕ)] ≡ Z d4x√−g (cid:20) −

f (ϕ)

2

R +

k(ϕ)

2

gµν(∇µϕ)(∇νϕ) − V (ϕ)(cid:21) ,

(2.1)

4

where g ≡ det gµν and R is the Ricci scalar. In addition, f (ϕ) is the non-minimal scalar-
curvature coupling function, k(ϕ) is the non-canonical inﬂaton wavefunction, and V (ϕ) is the
inﬂaton potential. We collectively call the functions f (ϕ), k(ϕ) and V (ϕ) model functions
that enter the action S in (2.1). We will adopt the convention ηµν = diag(+1,−1,−1,−1)
for the Minkowski ﬂat limit of gµν, and work in natural units where the mass parameters are
normalized to the reduced Planck mass MP ≡ (8πG)−1/2. Finally, we deﬁne the covariant
derivatives denoted by ∇µ to be metric-compatible with respect to gµν, meaning that the
action is diﬀeomorphism invariant.

By specifying the model functions f (ϕ), k(ϕ), and V (ϕ), we can cover a wide range of
models. For instance, the so-called F (R) theories may be described by setting k(ϕ) = 0.
More details are given in Section 7.3. In all scenarios, we assume that the inﬂaton relaxes
in its expected value ϕVEV at the end of inﬂation, and so the eﬀective reduced Planck mass
MP matches its observed value at the present epoch, i.e. f (ϕVEV) = M 2
P ≡ 1. For a review
of the dynamics of minimal inﬂationary scenarios, the reader may consult [18].

It is now important to study the response of the classical action S under conformal
rescalings of the metric gµν and reparameterizations of the inﬂaton ﬁeld ϕ. To this end, we
ﬁrst perform a conformal transformation by rescaling the metric

gµν → ˜gµν = Ω2 gµν ,

(2.2)

where the coordinate-dependent function Ω = Ω(x) is known as the conformal factor. Chang-
ing its value is often referred to as changing the conformal frame of the theory. Under the
conformal transformation (2.2), the Ricci scalar transforms as

eR = Ω−2R − 6 Ω−3gµν∇µ∇νΩ .

Likewise, we may perform an arbitrary inﬂaton reparameterization ϕ → ˜ϕ = ˜ϕ(ϕ), whose
explicit form may be determined by

= K(ϕ) .

Then, using (2.2) and (2.3) in (2.1), the classical action S, upon neglecting a total derivative,
can be rewritten in the form

(cid:18)d ˜ϕ
dϕ(cid:19)2
S[˜gµν, ˜ϕ, ˜f ( ˜ϕ), ˜k( ˜ϕ),eV ( ˜ϕ)] = Z d4xp−˜g "−
˜gµν(∇µ ˜ϕ)(∇ν ˜ϕ) − eV ( ˜ϕ)# .
In the above, the transformed model functions ˜f ( ˜ϕ), ˜k( ˜ϕ) and eV ( ˜ϕ) have been expressed in

terms of the original ones f (ϕ), k(ϕ) and V (ϕ) as follows [19, 20]:

˜f ( ˜ϕ) = Ω−2 f ,

˜k( ˜ϕ) =

eV ( ˜ϕ) = Ω−4 V .

Here, f (ϕ), k(ϕ) and V (ϕ), the conformal factor Ω, and their possible derivatives with re-
spect to ϕ, appearing on the right-hand side (RHS) of (2.6), all depend on ϕ. Alternatively,
they may also be expressed in terms of the transformed ﬁeld ˜ϕ through ϕ = ϕ( ˜ϕ), after
inverting the solution ˜ϕ = ˜ϕ(ϕ) to Equation (2.4). Technical details related to the deriva-
tion of the transformation properties of the model functions given in (2.6) are presented
in Appendix A.

The original action (2.1) is said to be in the Jordan frame, where the non-minimal cou-
pling of the inﬂaton to the curvature appears explicitly. In most analyses of inﬂationary
dynamics, one usually considers the Einstein frame, for which the conformal factor Ω is
chosen such that the non-minimal coupling becomes minimal: ˜f ( ˜ϕ) = M 2
P . However, in this
article, we will be more general and consider the full class of conformal transformations,
where Ω = Ω(x) is an arbitrary well-behaved function. There has been much discussion
about whether the Jordan frame or the Einstein frame are physically equivalent. In particu-
lar, there have been claims of both conformal independence [12] and conformal dependence
[21] in the literature. This is further compounded by the fact that after a conformal tran-
formation, the wavefunction k(ϕ) of the inﬂaton kinetic term is not canonical. Hence, some
authors include in their deﬁnition of “conformal transformations” a ﬁeld reparameterization
that renders the kinetic term canonical, i.e. k(ϕ) → 1. For this reason, we shall use a more
general terminology and call the combined eﬀect of a conformal transformation and a ﬁeld
reparameterization a frame transformation.

From the above discussion, it has become clear that the functional form of the classical
action S as deﬁned in (2.1) remains invariant under general frame transformations [cf. (2.5)].
The functional form of S could have been modiﬁed, for example, by the presence of higher-
order derivative terms induced by the conformal rescaling (2.2). This means that under frame
transformations, the action of a scalar-curvature theory gets transformed to an equivalent
action within the same class of theories. This basic property of invariance of the classical
action S in (2.1) under frame transformations may be expressed as follows:

(2.7)

S[gµν, ϕ, f (ϕ), k(ϕ), V (ϕ)] = S[˜gµν, ˜ϕ, ˜f ( ˜ϕ), ˜k( ˜ϕ),eV ( ˜ϕ)] .

Note that although the functional form of S does not change, the functions f , k and V
do change as given in (2.6), as a consequence of frame transformations. Equation (2.7)
represents a fundamental property that underlies our frame-covariant formulation of inﬂa-
tion.
In Section 8, we will show how this fundamental property (2.7) can be extended
to the eﬀective action beyond the tree-level approximation. Thus, developing a formalism
that can be applied to a general scalar-curvature theory will allow us to independently ex-
amine and compare the predictions for the inﬂationary observables that are obtained by

using S[gµν, ϕ, f (ϕ), k(ϕ), V (ϕ)] or S[˜gµν, ˜ϕ, ˜f ( ˜ϕ), ˜k( ˜ϕ),eV ( ˜ϕ)]. This exercise will be useful

to address the question of whether frame transformations are physically signiﬁcant or not.
Our ﬁrst step towards developing such a formalism will be to study the behaviour of the
background ﬁelds during inﬂation in the next section.

3. Classical Dynamics

In this section, we consider the cosmological evolution of the background inﬂaton ﬁeld ϕ,
since its imprint on observable quantities depends on the value of ϕ at horizon exit. Under
the assumption that the inﬂaton ϕ is spatially homogeneous evolving in a space described
by the FRW metric, we derive the equations of motion for ϕ by treating it as a perfect ﬂuid.

Taking now the functional derivative of the action (2.1) with respect to ϕ yields the

derive cosmological equations of motion for the general scalar-curvature theories [23],

Notice that these equations are written down by neglecting the spatial dependence of the
background inﬂaton ﬁeld ϕ, i.e. ϕ = ϕ(t).

The cosmological equations of motion that we have presented here for the background
metric gµν and the inﬂaton ﬁeld ϕ will be useful for our discussions in the subsequent sections.
Speciﬁcally, the general equations of motion for ϕ and gµν, stated in (3.2) and (3.5), will
be needed to study the cosmological perturbations in Section 4. Likewise, the homogeneous
limit of these equations presented in (3.18), (3.19) and (3.20) will be used to determine the
inﬂationary attractor trajectory for the scalar-curvature theories. The latter will in turn
be used in Section 5 to evaluate the predictions for cosmological observables of inﬂation in
these theories.

4. Cosmological Perturbations

The imprint left by inﬂation on the CMB can be understood in terms of perturbations
to the metric and the inﬂaton. At very early times, perturbations corresponding to scales
of cosmological interest (smaller than the current size of the observable universe) are inside
the Hubble horizon and are free to evolve [24]. When the perturbations leave the horizon,
they stop evolving [25], meaning that the observed anisotropy in the CMB at scales entering
the horizon in the current epoch was formed at the point of horizon exit. This anisotropy
can be found by calculating the two-point correlation function of cosmological perturbations
just before they exited the horizon. In this section, we will depart from the well-studied
perturbations in minimally-coupled inﬂationary models [18] and consider perturbations of

9

scalar-curvature theories. In order to make contact with observations, we will look at how
cosmological perturbations evolve with the aim of calculating the power spectrum of the
CMB. We will start by writing the explicit form of the perturbation of the metric, which
we will use to write down the linearized Einstein ﬁeld equations to ﬁrst order which control
how the classical perturbations evolve, allowing us to quantize them and to calculate the
two-point function, from which we may make contact with inﬂationary observables.

The ﬁrst step in determining the evolution of the quantized perturbations is to study the
evolution of classical perturbations. This is given by the linearized Einstein ﬁeld equations,

δGµν = M −2

P δT (NM)

µν

,

(4.1)

where δGµν and δT (NM)
tensors, Gµν and Tµν, that result from linear variations of ϕ and gµν. Explicitly, the inﬂaton ϕ
and the metric gµν may be expanded around their background values ¯ϕ and ¯gµν as

are the perturbations of the respective Einstein and energy-momentum

µν

ϕ = ¯ϕ + δϕ ,

gµν = ¯gµν + δgµν .

(4.2)

Parameterizing the perturbation δgµν of the metric is more involved, as there are several
degrees of freedom that need to be taken into account. Therefore, we adopt the standard
scalar-vector-tensor decomposition and expand the full metric gµν as follows:

gµνdxµdxν = (1 + 2φ)N 2

Ldt2 + 2a(∂iB + Bi)NLdt dxi

− a2h(1 + 2ψ)δij + ∂i∂jA + ∂iAj + ∂jAi + hiji dxidxj ,

(4.3)

where φ, ψ, A, B are the scalar perturbations, Ai, Bi are the vector perturbations and hij
is the tensor perturbation to the metric. All these perturbations are independent of each
other.

As the only persistent (scalar) measure of inﬂation, we introduce the diﬀeomorphism-

invariant comoving curvature perturbation Rϕ [26]:

Rϕ = φ −

(4.4)

where φ is the remaining physical degree of freedom in the perturbed metric. After expanding
the 00, 0i, and ij components of the linearized Einstein equations, we ﬁnd that the comoving
curvature perturbation R satisﬁes the following equation in Fourier space [27]:

which correspond to simple harmonic oscillators with time-dependent masses and the confor-
mal time η is given by NLdt = adη. Treating vR and its conjugate momentum as operators
and imposing the usual commutation relations on them, we can write down its mode expan-
sions in terms of the mode functions vR,k and the corresponding creation and annihilation
operators. Imposing the condition that, in the early time limit, the perturbations live in
de Sitter space, which is characterized by a constant vacuum density driving its accelerated
expansion and η = −1/(aH), we may write the mode functions that satisfy (4.11). Then,
from the condition that the solutions must correspond to the Bunch-Davies vacuum at very
early times [28], we can ﬁnally write the two-point correlation function for the canonical
ﬁelds vR,

hvR,k1|vR,k2i = |vR,k|2 δ(k1 + k2) ,

This is the correlation function for ﬁelds in de Sitter space, but since inﬂation ends when
the comoving horizon stops shrinking, the ﬁelds are in quasi-de Sitter space, and their two-
point correlation function is related to that of the canonical ﬁelds by the normalization (4.9).
For scalar perturbations, we may arrive at the two-point correlation function ∆R ≡ |vR,k|2,
which is given by

∆R =

H 4
ZR ˙ϕ2 ,

11

where from now on, we use unbarred quantities to denote the background.

Observable cosmological quantities which can be measured on the CMB are linked to the
primordial perturbations through transfer functions which induce a multiplicative multipole
contribution to the power spectrum of scalar perturbations [29],

PR ≡

k3
4π2 ∆R .

(4.15)

In a similar way, we may write the power spectrum PT for tensor perturbations calculated
through the correlation function ∆T ≡ |vT,k|2 = H 2/ZT , i.e.

PT =

2k3
π2 ∆T .

(4.16)

In the standard Einstein gravity, (4.15) and (4.16) reduce to their usual expressions. The
power spectra are further related to the primordial density perturbation via a multiplicative
factor due to quadrupole anisotropies. However, the scale dependence of the spectrum is
independent of this factor. The scale dependence, which is termed the spectral index or
scalar tilt, is deﬁned as

nR − 1 ≡

,

(4.17)

where k = aH is the horizon crossing condition, since the horizon crossing time is when the
perturbations left their observable imprint on the scalar tilt. There is an analogous relation
for the tensor tilt,

Another useful observable is the tensor-to-scalar ratio r, which is deﬁned as

(4.18)

(4.19)

d ln ∆R

d ln k (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k=aH

Finally, we may deﬁne the running of the spectral indices, which encodes their scale depen-
dence, as follows:

Observe that the power spectra and all observable quantities derived from them depend
solely on the background, even though these quantities are of pure quantum-mechanical
origin.

5. Slow-Roll Inﬂation

In this section we present the slow-roll approximation formalism which is often employed
to approximate the equations of motion governing the inﬂationary dynamics in scalar-
curvature theories, as well as calculate all cosmological observables from the scalar and
tensor power spectra PR and PT [cf. (4.17) and (4.19)]. To this end, we ﬁrst deﬁne the
Hubble slow-roll parameters which we use to express the predictions for the cosmological
observables of inﬂation, such as nR, nT and r. We then discuss the inﬂationary attractor
solution, with aid of which the inﬂationary observables can be expressed in a concise manner
in terms of new potential slow-roll parameters which only depend on the model functions
f (ϕ), k(ϕ), and V (ϕ) and their derivatives with respect to ϕ.

5.1. Hubble Slow-Roll Inﬂation

The basic working hypothesis in the slow-roll approximation formalism is that, during

inﬂation, the following double inequality holds:

¨ϕ ≪ H ˙ϕ ≪ H 2ϕ .

(5.1)

The above hierarchy of energy scales was ﬁrst considered to describe minimal inﬂation [30].
Nevertheless, this hierarchy of scales can be extended to non-minimal inﬂation in general
scalar-curvature theories by noting that, for any well-behaved function g(ϕ) of the inﬂaton
ϕ, one may require [31] that

This motivates us to deﬁne the following Hubble slow-roll parameters [32]1:

¨g ≪ H ˙g ≪ H 2g .

(5.2)

(5.3)

(5.4)

(5.5)

Note that the Hubble slow-roll parameters provide a measure of the deviation of the universe
from an exact de Sitter space. In particular, the slow-roll parameters κH and σH deﬁned
in (5.4) are necessary to fully describe the dynamics in non-minimal inﬂation. In the Einstein

1Note that our notation for these parameters can be linked to the notation in [32] by

ǫH = −ǫ1 ,

δH = −ǫ2 ,

κH = ǫ3 ,

σH = ǫ4 .

13

frame, it is also possible to establish the relation ηH ≡ ˙ǫH /(HǫH) = 2ǫH − 2δH . However, for
the scalar-curvature theories under study, δH proves to be more convenient for computing
cosmological observables of inﬂation [33], rather than the more frequently used parameter ηH.
For later convenience, we also deﬁne the quantity

ηH ≡ ǫH + δH ,

(5.6)

which diﬀers from ηH.

We are now in a position to calculate the cosmological observables of inﬂation in the slow-
roll approximation in terms of the Hubble slow-roll parameters deﬁned in (5.3) and (5.4).
With the help of these parameters, we may write down ZR given in (4.7) as

E/f

(1 + κH)2 .

(5.7)

k + 3 ˙f 2
2f ˙ϕ2

(cid:16)1 +

ZR =

2Hf(cid:17)2 =

Observe that ZR is a key parameter in inﬂationary dynamics, as it enters the deﬁnition of
the scalar power spectrum PR in (4.15) through ∆R in (4.14).

Since the cosmological perturbations freeze outside the horizon, their power spectrum PR
when they ﬁrst exit the horizon will match the one observed at the present epoch, assuming
that we only observe scales that are just re-entering the horizon without having time to
evolve further. The condition for this second horizon crossing due to the re-entry of the
perturbations is given by aH = k. The latter can be rewritten as

ln k = ln a + ln H .

(5.8)

Employing the deﬁnition of e-folds: dN = Hdτ = d ln a and the relation (5.8), we easily
ﬁnd that

d ln k
dN

= 1 +

d ln H

dN

= 1 − ǫH .

(5.9)

We may now calculate the spectral index nR in (4.17), by using the chain rule, by means
of (5.9), along with the expression for ZR in (5.7). Keeping only the leading order in a series
expansion of the slow-roll parameters, we arrive at [27, 32]

nR = 1 − 4ǫH + 2δH + 2κH − 2σH .

(5.10)

In deriving (5.10), we have assumed that the Hubble slow-roll parameters are slowly varying,
such that we may discard their time derivatives, as dictated by the generalized slow-roll
approximation given in (5.2). Proceeding as above for the cosmological observables nT and
r deﬁned in (4.18) and (4.19), respectively, we obtain in the slow-roll approximation,

nT = −2ǫH − 2κH ,
r = 16ǫH + 16κH .

(5.11)
(5.12)

14

Analogous leading-order expressions can be derived for αR and αT , by using (5.10) and (5.11)
in their deﬁnitions (4.20) and (4.21).

In spite of having expressed the inﬂationary observables in a compact form in terms
of the Hubble slow-roll parameters, their accurate evaluation at horizon crossing remains
still a challenge. In particular, the inﬂationary observables often depend crucially on the
t H dt (with NL = 1), where the cosmic time

number of e-folds, given by N(t, tend) = R tend

tend characterizing the end of inﬂation may be determined by the condition

max(ǫH ,|ηH|) = 1 ,

(5.13)

where ηH is given in (5.6). However, this condition only applies in the Einstein frame, and
as we will show in Section 6, it is frame-dependent, which necessitates the introduction of
an appropriate frame-covariant extension for it to be applicable in general Jordan frames.

5.2. The Inﬂationary Attractor Trajectory

In the Einstein frame, the equations of motions can be drastically simpliﬁed, if certain
conditions are met, which assure that the slow-roll parameters are suﬃciently small at early
times, so as to successfully generate inﬂationary dynamics. These conditions select a class
of solutions known as the inﬂationary attractor trajectory, to which all other inﬂationary
trajectories converge rapidly independent of their initial position in phase space, such that
the use of the so-called slow-roll approximation is justiﬁed [34]. As we will see in the next
subsection, we may use the inﬂationary attractor solution to write the Hubble slow-roll
parameters in terms of the potential U(ϕ) and its derivatives with respect to the inﬂaton
ﬁeld ϕ. Thus, one may deﬁne a new set of fully equivalent parameters called the potential
slow-roll parameters. Our aim is to generalize this procedure to scalar-curvature theories in
the Jordan frame.

The ﬁrst step in doing so is to derive the approximate equations of motion that govern
the inﬂationary attractor trajectory. Therefore, we start with the generalized equations of
motion for the background metric and inﬂaton ﬁelds, and express them in terms of the
Hubble slow-roll parameters ǫH , δH , κH and σH . With the help of (5.3) and (5.4), and upon
substitution of (3.20) into (3.19), the Friedmann equation may be rewritten as

H 2 =

f U

3 (cid:18)1 −

ǫH
3 −

θH

3 (cid:19)−1

.

For convenience, we have deﬁned a new slow-roll parameter θH,

θH ≡

1
2

¨f
H 2f

.

(5.14)

(5.15)

As we will now show, θH is of higher order than the rest of the slow-roll parameters. Using
(5.4) in (5.15), it follows that

θH =

1

2(cid:18)f,ϕϕ ˙ϕ2

H 2f − δH κH(cid:19) .

(5.16)

15

In order to eliminate the term ∝ f,ϕϕ in (5.16), we use the fact that ˙κH/H can also be
written as

˙κH
H

=

f,ϕϕ ˙ϕ2
H 2f − δH κH + ǫHκH − κ2
H .

Using (5.17) in (5.16), we ﬁnally arrive at

θH =

1

HκH − ǫH + κH(cid:19) κH .
2(cid:18) ˙κH

The latter shows that, to the leading linear order in the slow-roll approximation, θH van-
ishes. This result is also consistent with the one that one would have naively obtained by
considering the double inequality in (5.2).

Similarly, after dividing (3.18) by 3H ˙ϕE/f , where E is deﬁned in (5.5), the inﬂaton

equation of motion may be recast into the form,

1 −

1

δH +

(5.19)

Note that the last term on the left-hand side (LHS) of (5.19) can easily be shown to be
smaller in size than 2

(5.17)

(5.18)

Finally, the acceleration equation (3.20) can be written down as

3|κH|:
k ˙f

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

3HE(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

ǫH + κH − θH =

k ˙ϕ2
2H 2f

3|κH| .

(5.20)

(5.21)

The inﬂationary attractor solution is obtained by considering only the leading terms in
the Friedmann and inﬂaton equations (5.14) and (5.19). Hence, ignoring all terms depending
on the Hubble slow-roll parameters, we ﬁnd that (5.14) and (5.19) simplify to

H 2 ≈

f U
3

,

H ˙ϕ ≈ −

f 3 U,ϕ

,

(5.22)

which determine the inﬂationary attractor trajectory in the leading slow-roll approximation.
By dividing separately the LHSs and RHSs of the two equations of motions in (5.22), we
obtain the useful relation

H
˙ϕ ≈ −

E U
f 2 U,ϕ

.

(5.23)

With the aid of (5.22) and (5.23), in the next subsection we can deﬁne a new set of potential
slow-roll parameters, which will be used to express all relevant cosmological observables of
inﬂation in a concise manner.

5.3. Potential Slow-Roll Inﬂation

Having derived the equations of motion that determine the inﬂationary attractor trajec-
tory in (5.22), we are now in a position to express the Hubble slow-roll parameters ǫH , δH ,
κH and σH , given in (5.3), in terms of the model functions f (ϕ), k(ϕ) (or E(ϕ)) and U(ϕ)
and their derivatives with respect to ϕ, without making any explicit reference to the Einstein
frame. The new parameters so derived will be called the potential slow-roll parameters to
distinguish them from the Hubble slow-roll parameters in (5.3) and they will be valid in any
Jordan frame.

We start our derivation by noticing that time derivatives acting on ϕ, e.g.

˙ϕ, can be
eliminated by virtue of (5.23) and that time derivatives acting on the Hubble parameter
˙H, may also be replaced with ϕ-derivatives acting on f and U, after diﬀerentiating
H, e.g.
both sides of the ﬁrst equation in (5.22) with respect to the rescaled cosmic time τ . In this
way, we may derive from the Hubble slow-roll parameters a new set of parameters, such that
ǫU ≈ ǫH, δU ≈ δH, κU ≈ κH and σU ≈ σH , which do not depend on H and ˙ϕ.

Following carefully the procedure mentioned above, the potential slow-roll parameters

generalized in the Jordan frame are found to be

ǫU ≡

κU ≡ −

(5.24)

Because of the equivalence between the Hubble and potential slow-roll parameters in the
slow-roll approximation, writing down the analytical formulae for the tensor-to-scalar ratio r,
and the spectral indices nR and nT in terms of the latter parameters becomes a simple task.
In fact, what we only need to do is to replace the Hubble slow-roll parameters in the
expressions (5.12), (5.10) and (5.11), with their potential counterparts:

r = 16ǫU + 16κU ,
nR = 1 − 4ǫU + 2δU + 2κU − 2σU ,
nT = − 2ǫU − 2κU .

(5.25)
(5.26)
(5.27)

Note that the results for r and nT conﬁrm the so-called “consistency relation” of minimal
inﬂation,

r = − 8nT ,

(5.28)

which remains also valid in the context of general scalar-curvature theories.

We may similarly proceed to derive analytic expressions for the runnings αR and αT of
the spectral indices nR and nT in terms of the potential slow-roll parameters. With this
aim, we ﬁrst note the useful chain-rule relation:

dϕ
d ln k

In arriving at the last expression in (5.29), we ﬁrst used (5.9) and then (5.23), and approxi-
mated (1− ǫH )−1 ≈ 1, in the leading slow-roll approximation. On the basis of the deﬁnitions
for the spectral runnings αR and αT in (4.20) and (4.21), and after employing the chain-rule
relation (5.29), we ﬁnd

αR = −

αT = −

E U (cid:16)2ǫU + 2κU(cid:17),ϕ

f 2 U,ϕ

.

,

(5.30)

(5.31)

In Section 7, we will use the analytical expressions stated in (5.25), (5.26), (5.30) and
(5.31) to obtain predictions for all relevant cosmological observables of inﬂation in speciﬁc
models.
In this context, we should remark here that all the inﬂationary observables of
interest must be evaluated at inﬂaton ﬁeld values ϕ, which typically correspond to the time
when the observed cosmological scales have left the horizon, i.e. about N = 60 e-folds before
the end of inﬂation.

Another advantage of our formalism is that the four potential slow-roll parameters ǫU ,
δU , σU and κU and their ϕ-derivatives suﬃce to calculate all the observables to leading
order in the slow-roll approximation. Indeed, if we were to calculate higher runnings of the
spectral indices, we would not need to introduce new slow-roll parameters as is usually done
in the Einstein frame, but only higher derivatives of ǫU , δU , σU and κU with respect to ϕ.
Nonetheless, we may conﬁrm that our expressions for the cosmological observables reduce to
the well-known ones quoted in the literature for the minimally coupled inﬂation models [18]:

r = 16ǫV ,

nR = 1 − 6ǫV + 2ηV ,
αR = −16ǫV ηV + 24ǫ2

V + 2ξ2

nT = −2ǫV ,

(5.33)

(5.34)

(5.35)

For completeness, we also derive simpliﬁed expressions for the power spectra of the
curvature and tensor perturbations PR and PT , given by (4.15) and (4.16), in the slow-roll
approximation. Employing (5.7), (5.22), and (5.23), the power spectra PR and PT take on
the simple form

Finally, thanks to (5.23), the number of e-folds may be evaluated to leading order in the
slow-roll approximation as

N(ϕ) = −Z ϕend

ϕ

dϕ′ E(ϕ′)
f (ϕ′)2

U(ϕ′)
U(ϕ′),ϕ′

,

(5.38)

where ϕend is the inﬂaton value at the end of inﬂation, which is usually determined by the
condition:

max(ǫU ,|ηU|) = 1 ,

(5.39)

with ηU ≡ ǫU + δU .

An obstacle in our approach to derive a frame-covariant formulation of inﬂation is the
fact that the number of e-folds N, and especially ϕend, are not frame-invariant quantities.
This means that the end-of-inﬂation condition (5.39) requires a non-trivial extension in order
to hold true in an arbitrary Jordan frame. In order to be able to ﬁnd this missing piece
of information, we study in the next section the transformation properties of the potential
slow-roll parameters under frame transformations.

6. Frame Covariance

In this section, we will use the results that we derived in Section 5, in the context of scalar-
curvature theories, in order to evaluate the cosmological observables in diﬀerent frames.
Even though the action S for these theories is not invariant under conformal rescalings of
the metric gµν and ﬁeld reparameterizations of the inﬂaton ﬁeld ϕ, its functional dependence
on the transformed metric ˜gµν and inﬂaton ﬁeld ˜ϕ, and the transformed model functions ˜f , ˜k

and eV , does not change [cf. (2.7)]2. Given the transformation properties of these quantities,

we may determine how the potential slow-roll parameters transform. Taking the latter into
account, we will show that the physical cosmological observables remain invariant under
frame transformations in the leading order of the slow-roll approximation.

6.1. Conformal Transformations

Let us ﬁrst examine how the generalized potential slow-roll parameters ǫU , δU , κU and σU ,
as deﬁned in (5.24), would change by considering only a conformal rescaling of the metric gµν,
according to (2.2). For this purpose, we take into account the relations of the transformed

model functions ˜f , ˜k and eV in terms of the original ones f , k and V , by setting K = 1 in

(2.6), which amounts to ˜ϕ = ϕ. We then ﬁnd that the quantities U and E, given in (3.6)
and (5.5), transform correspondingly as

eU(ϕ) = U(ϕ) ,

eE(ϕ) =

E(ϕ)

Ω4

.

(6.1)

2Our frame-covariant approach to scalar-curvature theories is general, as it describes the transformation
properties of kinematic parameters from one Jordan frame to another arbitrary Jordan frame, and so includes
the special class of Jordan-to-Einstein frame transformations discussed in [13].

19

We may now use the original deﬁnitions of the slow-roll parameters in (5.24) to compute

the transformed ones, by replacing U(ϕ) → eU ( ˜ϕ) and f (ϕ) → ˜f ( ˜ϕ), with ˜ϕ = ϕ. In this

way, we have, for example,

˜ǫU (ϕ) =

and similarly for ˜δU , ˜κU and ˜σU .
of (2.6), we ﬁnd that they transform as

If we expand the new slow-roll parameters by means

1
2

,

˜feU, ˜ϕ( ˜feU), ˜ϕ
eEeU 2
˜δU (ϕ) = δU (ϕ) − ∆Ω(ϕ) ,
˜σU (ϕ) = σU (ϕ) + 2∆Ω(ϕ) ,

˜ǫU (ϕ) = ǫU (ϕ) − ∆Ω(ϕ) ,
˜κU (ϕ) = κU (ϕ) + ∆Ω(ϕ) ,

where

∆Ω ≡

f 2U,ϕ
EU

Ω,ϕ
Ω

.

(6.2)

(6.3)

(6.4)

(6.5)

(6.6)

Evidently, depending on the actual value of ∆Ω, the slow-roll parameters may not be small
and can have either sign after a conformal transformation.

6.2. Inﬂaton Reparameterizations

Let us now discuss a second class of general frame transformations, under which only the
inﬂaton ﬁeld ϕ gets reparameterized as ϕ → ˜ϕ = ˜ϕ(ϕ). Such a ﬁeld reparameterization may
be determined through the diﬀerential equation (d ˜ϕ/dϕ)2 = K(ϕ) [cf. (2.4)], where K(ϕ)
is an arbitrary function of ϕ. Inﬂaton reparameterizations, with K(ϕ) = k(ϕ), are usually
performed in the literature to make the inﬂaton kinetic term canonical, but here we will not
impose this restriction.

Applying (2.6) to the transformed model functions ˜f , ˜k and eV for Ω = 1 yields

˜V ( ˜ϕ) = V (ϕ( ˜ϕ)) ,

˜f ( ˜ϕ) = f (ϕ( ˜ϕ)) ,

˜k( ˜ϕ) =

k(ϕ( ˜ϕ))
K(ϕ( ˜ϕ))

,

implying that

E(ϕ( ˜ϕ))
K(ϕ( ˜ϕ))

.

eE( ˜ϕ) =

Here, we have assumed that the function ˜ϕ = ˜ϕ(ϕ) can be inverted to ϕ = ϕ( ˜ϕ), at least
piecewise.

As was done above for the case of conformal transformations only, we rely on the ana-
lytical expressions given in (5.24) to calculate the transformed slow-roll parameters ˜ǫU , ˜δU ,
˜κU and ˜σU , as functions of ˜ϕ. We then use the chain rule,

d

=

(6.7)

to re-express them in terms of the original slow-roll parameters ǫU , δU , κU and σU , which
depend on the original inﬂaton ﬁeld ϕ. Thus, under an inﬂaton reparameterization, the
slow-roll parameters transform as

˜ǫU ( ˜ϕ) = ǫU (ϕ) ,
˜κU ( ˜ϕ) = κU (ϕ) ,

˜δU ( ˜ϕ) = δU (ϕ) + ∆K(ϕ) ,
˜σU ( ˜ϕ) = σU (ϕ) + ∆K(ϕ) ,

where we have deﬁned

∆K(ϕ) ≡

(6.8)

(6.9)

Notice that under a reparameterization of the inﬂaton ﬁeld ϕ, only the slow-roll parame-
ters δU and σU get transformed.

6.3. Invariance Under Frame Transformations

Given the transformation properties of the potential slow-roll parameters stated in (6.3)
and (6.8), it is straightforward to show that the cosmological observables of inﬂation, such
as the tensor-to-scalar ratio r, the scalar and tensor spectral indices nR and nT , and their
runnings αR and αT , do not depend on the choice of frame in the leading order of the slow-
roll approximation. Employing the analytical expressions (5.25), (5.26), (5.27), (5.30) and
(5.31) for the aforementioned cosmological observables in terms of slow-roll parameters, we
ﬁnd that

er( ˜ϕ) = r(ϕ) ,

enT ( ˜ϕ) = nT (ϕ) ,
eαR( ˜ϕ) = αR(ϕ) ,

enR( ˜ϕ) = nR(ϕ) ,
eαT ( ˜ϕ) = αT (ϕ) .

(6.10)

It should be stressed here that the inﬂationary observables r, nR, nT , αR and αT are invariant
under the separate action of conformal rescalings of the metric gµν and ﬁeld reparameteri-
zations of the ﬁeld ϕ.

The frame invariance of the cosmological observables shown above holds, as long as their
ϕ-dependence through ϕ = ϕ( ˜ϕ) is taken into account. However, this frame invariance is
spoiled, once the same observables are naively expressed in terms of the number of e-folds
N. In fact, under conformal rescalings of the metric, the number of e-folds N does transform
and is not frame-invariant. To see this explicitly, we ﬁrst note that the exact determination
of N is given by

t

N = Z tend
˜a′ = Z aend

NLH dt′ = Z aend
a′ + Z Ωend

d˜a′

(6.11)

(6.12)

which transforms to

eN = Z ˜aend

˜a

21

Thus, N is not frame invariant, as it receives an extra contribution given by ln(Ωend/Ω). It
is interesting to compare this last result with the corresponding one that would have been
obtained by virtue of (5.38) which was derived in the slow-roll approximation. Making use of
the transformation properties of E(ϕ) and f (ϕ) reported above, we ﬁnd that the integrand
in (5.38) remains unaltered under frame transformations. However, the ﬁeld value of ϕ at the
end of inﬂation, ϕend, is usually determined by the condition max(ǫU ,|ηU|) = 1 [cf. (5.39)],
which is only applicable in the Einstein frame. Since the end-of-inﬂation condition (5.39) is
frame-dependent, we need to deduce its frame-invariant generalization that should hold to
any Jordan frame. This is given by

max(ǫU + κU ,|ǫU + δU + 4κU − σU|) = 1 .

(6.13)

As we will show below, this generalization is unique and reduces to the Einstein case when

κU = σU = 0. Hence, by means of (6.13), we have ˜ϕend = ˜ϕ(ϕend), and so N(ϕ) = eN( ˜ϕ)

in the slow-roll approximation. This exercise tells us that the unwanted term ln(Ωend/Ω)
on the RHS of (6.12) would only become signiﬁcant beyond the leading order of the slow-
roll approximation. Consequently, we have shown that all relevant cosmological observables
are frame-invariant when expressed in terms of the number of e-folds N in the slow-roll
approximation:

er(eN) = r(N) ,

enT (eN) = nT (N) ,
eαR(eN) = αR(N) ,

enR(eN ) = nR(N) ,
eαT (eN ) = αT (N) .

(6.14)

In order to explicitly demonstrate the uniqueness of the end-of-inﬂation condition (6.13),
we will prove that demanding σU = κU = 0 uniquely singles out the Einstein frame. With
the help of (6.3) and (6.8), we readily see that σU and κU transform as

˜κU = κU + ∆Ω ,

˜σU = σU + 2∆Ω + ∆K .

Requiring the vanishing of ˜σU and ˜κU implies

∆Ω = − κU ,

∆K = − σU + 2κU .

(6.15)

(6.16)

Using the deﬁnition of ∆Ω and ∆K in (6.4) and (6.9), respectively, along with the deﬁnitions
of the slow-roll parameters κU and σU in (5.24), we obtain

Ω,ϕ

2 K

(6.17)

(6.18)

These two constraining diﬀerential equations can be easily solved ﬁrst for Ω and then for
K. In this way, we ﬁnd that

M 2Ω2 = f ,

K = E/f 2 .

(6.19)

However, the solutions for Ω and K, given in (6.19), single out uniquely the Einstein frame
from an arbitrary Jordan frame, provided the mass parameter M is set equal to the reduced
Planck mass MP .

7. Speciﬁc Models

In this section we will apply our frame-covariant formalism to a few typical scalar-
curvature models of inﬂation, such as induced gravity inﬂation and Higgs inﬂation.
In
addition, we consider Starobinsky-like F (R) models of inﬂation, which can be shown to be
equivalent to scalar-curvature theories via a Legendre transform, after the introduction of
an auxiliary scalar ﬁeld. In all the examples that we will be considering, we assume that the
slow-roll approximation describes well the inﬂationary dynamics, such that we can use the
results presented in Section 5.3 to derive analytical expressions for all relevant cosmological
observables, such as the tensor-to-scalar ratio r, the scalar and tensor spectral indices nR
and nT , and their runnings αR and αT .

7.1. Induced Gravity Inﬂation

Induced gravity inﬂation postulates that the value of the eﬀective Planck mass MP is
exclusively controlled by the VEV of the inﬂaton ﬁeld ϕ.
In the Jordan frame, induced
gravity inﬂation is described by a non-minimal coupling f (ϕ) = ξϕ2 to the Ricci scalar R, a
P /ξ2)2 [35,
canonical kinetic term, i.e. k(ϕ) = 1, and a potential of the form V (ϕ) = λ(ϕ2−M 2
36].

Knowing the explicit forms of the model functions f (ϕ), k(ϕ) and V (ϕ), we may ﬁrst use
them to evaluate the generalized slow-roll parameters ǫU , δU , κU and σU deﬁned in (5.24).
Then, with the aid of these parameters, we can analytically calculate all relevant inﬂationary
parameters in the slow-roll approximation, as functions of the inﬂaton ﬁeld ϕ. In detail, we
ﬁnd

with nT = −r/8. In the same slow-roll approximation, the number of e-folds N is found to
be

P − ξϕ2(cid:3)

.

(7.5)

Here we used the fact that induced gravity inﬂation ends at exactly ϕ = ϕend = MP /√ξ.

There are two scenarios of gravity induced inﬂation: (i) the scenario of small-ﬁeld inﬂa-
P , and (ii) the scenario
P . Ideally, we wish to express

tion, in which the inﬂaton starts at small values, in which ξϕ2 ≪ M 2
of standard chaotic large-ﬁeld inﬂation, in which ξϕ2 ≫ M 2

23

quantities in terms of the number N of e-folds. To do this, we must invert the relation
N = N(ϕ) to ϕ = ϕ(N), in order to substitute the latter into the inﬂationary observables.
However, this proves to be challenging for most models. Therefore, our strategy will be to
expand N(ϕ) (about zero for small-ﬁeld inﬂation, and about inﬁnity for large-ﬁeld inﬂation),
truncate the series to lowest order, and then invert this truncated relation, before substitut-
ing it into the expressions for the inﬂationary observables. This will help us to make contact
with already established results in the literature, while simultaneously allowing for more
accurate predictions to be extracted simply by including more terms in the series expansion.

7.1.1. Small-Field Inﬂation

For small-ﬁeld (SF) inﬂation, a good approximation is obtained, if the cosmological
observables listed in (7.1)–(7.4) and the number of e-folds N in (7.5) are expanded about
ϕ = 0, thus assuming that the horizon exit happened long before the end of inﬂation. Thus,
for SF values of ϕ, the number of e-folds N becomes

N = −

1 + 6ξ

8ξ

(cid:20)ln(cid:18) ξϕ2

P(cid:19) + 1(cid:21) .

M 2

(7.6)

From this last expression, we see that a large number of e-folds N corresponds to small
values of ϕ.

We may now invert the relation N = N(ϕ) given in (7.6), i.e. as ϕ = ϕ(N), so as to
write the cosmological observables in terms of N. Hence, in the SF approximation for ϕ, we
get

(7.7)

(7.8)

with βξ = 8ξ/(1 + 6ξ). In particular, for a large number N of e-folds, we ﬁnd

rSF ≃

,

nR,SF ≃ 1 −

16ξ

1 + 6ξ

.

Consequently, the tensor-to-scalar ratio r and the scalar spectral index nR are not sensitive
to N in the gravity induced scenario of SF inﬂation. Expressions similar to (7.8) have been
reported in the literature [23], all of which are approximations of (7.7) for a large number N
of e-folds.

24

7.1.2. Large-Field Inﬂation

For the case of the gravity induced scenario of large-ﬁeld (LF) inﬂation, we expand the
analytical expressions (7.1)–(7.5) of all relevant inﬂationary quantities given in terms of ϕ
about inﬁnity. In this LF limit, the number of e-folds simpliﬁes to

N =

(1 + 6ξ)ϕ2

(7.9)

Substituting this expression in (7.1)–(7.4), the inﬂationary observables in the same LF limit

Finally, it is interesting to evaluate the admissible value of λ by the normalization of the

power spectrum,

∆R =

.

In terms of N, this is given by

∆R =

The power spectrum is normalised via [37]

where U(ϕ) ≡ V (ϕ)/f 2(ϕ) [cf. (3.6)], and ǫU and κU are given in (5.24). Hence, the value of
the quartic coupling λ may be estimated in terms of the non-minimal coupling ξ as follows:

λ ≈ (0.027)4 ×

ξ(1 + 6ξ)

2N 2

,

(7.15)

where N ≈ 60 is the scale at which the largest cosmological scales have presently re-entered
the horizon. We should reiterate here that, to leading order in 1/N, our analytical pre-
dictions for the cosmological observables ∆R, r and nR reproduce the results known from
the literature [23] for both the scenarios of SF and LF induced gravity inﬂation. Within
our frame-covariant formalism, however, the full frame-invariant expressions for all inﬂa-
tionary quantities can be computed to arbitrarily high order in 1/N, simply by including
higher-order terms in the expansion for N(ϕ).

7.2. Higgs Inﬂation

This scenario is based on the radical suggestion [38, 40] that the inﬂaton ﬁeld ϕ is the
Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson observed at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
In order to make such a scenario phenomenologically viable, however, a sizable non-minimal
coupling ξ of the Higgs ﬁeld ϕ to the curvature R is required, which may be partly attributed
to renormalization-group running eﬀects, even within the SM in curved space [39].

In the Jordan frame, the model of Higgs inﬂation can be fully described by the non-
minimal coupling function f (ϕ) = M 2
P +ξϕ2, a canonical kinetic term for the inﬂaton (k(ϕ) =
1), and the SM potential: V (ϕ) = λ(ϕ2 − v2)2, where v is the VEV of the Higgs boson. As
before, we apply our frame-covariant approach of inﬂation in the slow-roll approximation to
analytically compute the cosmological observables, i.e.

(7.19)

In the above, we also quote approximate results for large values of e-folds N, assuming that
ξ >

∼ 1.

We may now estimate the size of ξ, using the normalization of the dimensionless power

spectrum ∆R. The power spectrum in terms of the inﬂaton ﬁeld ϕ is given by

P + ξϕ2)2
which may be translated into the number N of e-folds as

P (M 2

(7.20)

∆R =

16λN 3(8ξN + 1)

(1 + 6ξ)[(8N + 6)ξ + 1]2 .

(7.21)

Setting λ = 0.129 as the value for the quartic coupling (corresponding to a SM Higgs-boson
mass of 125 GeV) and N = 60 as the nominal number of e-folds for the horizon exit, we
may match ∆R with the normalization (7.14) to deduce the known result [38]:

ξ =

N
√3

√λ

(0.027)2 ≈ 17, 000 .

(7.22)

27

Note that our method for deriving observables does not require transforming to the Einstein
frame, in which ﬁnding a closed-form expression of the potential is not possible. Hence, our
frame-covariant approach leads to more accurate results which still agree to leading order
in 1/N with those reported in the literature [38, 40].

7.3. F (R) Models

An interesting class of possible inﬂationary scenarios emerges, when the universe self-
accelerates without the direct presence of a scalar ﬁeld [42]. A wide range of such models is
encoded in F (R) theories, which are described by the following action:

S[gµν, F ] = −Z d4x√−g

F (R)

2

.

(7.23)

These theories may be recast in a form equivalent to the scalar-curvature theories by intro-
ducing an auxiliary ﬁeld Φ:

S[gµν, Φ] = −Z d4x√−g

1

2hF (Φ) + F (Φ),Φ(R − Φ)i .

(7.24)

It is not diﬃcult to check that the equation of motion for Φ, δS/δΦ = 0, implies Φ = R,
provided F (Φ),ΦΦ does not vanish in the domain of interest. Consequently, the action
in (7.24) is equivalent to the original action of F (R) theories given in (7.23).

We may now introduce another ﬁeld ϕ, such that

ϕ = F (Φ),Φ ,

which will play the role of the inﬂaton. To this end, we write (7.24) as

(7.25)

(7.26)

(7.27)

S[gµν, ϕ] = Z d4x√−g(cid:20) −

1
2

where V (ϕ) is given by

V (ϕ) =

1
2

ϕ Φ(ϕ) −

1
2

ϕ R + V (ϕ)(cid:21) ,
F(cid:0)Φ(ϕ)(cid:1) .

Here, the expression for Φ = Φ(ϕ) comes from inverting the functional relation in (7.25).
This action is equivalent to a special class of scalar-curvature theories, termed Brans-Dicke
models [41], with the additional constraint: k(ϕ) = 0, i.e. the absence of an inﬂaton kinetic
term in the considered Jordan frame.

We will now present some typical results that can be obtained for a simple class of
F (R) theories, within our frame-covariant formalism of inﬂation. We consider a modiﬁed
version of the Starobinsky model [42] that still oﬀers analytic predictions. In this version of
Starobinsky-like inﬂation, the function F (R) assumes the form

F (R) = αR + βnRn ,

(7.28)

28

where α and βn are arbitrary parameters and n ≥ 2. The usual procedure would be to
perform a conformal transformation of the action (7.26) to go to the Einstein frame [43].
Within our frame-covariant approach, however, this intermediate computational step be-
comes unnecessary. Instead, we may simply use the functional form of F (R) to arrive at
an expression for the potential V (ϕ), as given in (7.27), and derive predictions for the cos-
mological observables by considering the equivalent scalar-curvature theory in the Jordan
frame.

Given the form of F (R) in (7.28), (7.25) yields

ϕ(Φ) = α + βnnΦn−1 ,

which is easily inverted to

The potential thus becomes

.

βnn (cid:19)1/(n−1)

V (ϕ) =

.

(7.31)

For this class of Starobinsky-like theories, the model functions are: f (ϕ) = ϕ, k(ϕ) =
0, and V (ϕ) is given by (7.31). Applying the results of our frame-covariant formalism
presented in Section 5.3, the following analytic expressions for the cosmological parameters
are obtained:

[(n − 2)ϕ − 2α(n − 1)]2

(7.33)

(7.34)

(7.35)

with nT = −r/8. As before, the inﬂaton ﬁeld value ϕ must be evaluated at the point of
horizon crossing. We note that generically, ϕ starts small during inﬂation and gets even
smaller as the number of e-folds increases. Hence, we calculate the number of e-folds N by
expanding ϕ about ϕend to lowest order:

N = −

3
2

(n − 1)(ϕ − ϕend)(ϕend − α)
ϕend[(n − 2)ϕend − 2α(n − 1)]

At the end of inﬂation, we expect that F (R) = M 2

P R, i.e.

F (Rend) = αRend + βnRn

As a consequence, the number of e-folds N in (7.36) becomes

We observe that βn does not enter the expressions for the observables. In fact, all inﬂationary
observables are independent of βn, to all orders in 1/N. Instead, we see that there is strong
dependence on the power n of Rn in (7.28), and for α = M 2
P , the expressions listed in (7.41)
become independent of the number of e-folds N through order 1/N. Finally, we note that,
for α 6= M 2
P , the runnings of the spectral indices αR and αT start at order 1/N, and so
they turn out to be at least one order of magnitude larger than those found in the models
of induced gravity and Higgs inﬂation.

8. Beyond the Tree-Level Approximation

In the process of developing a frame-covariant formalism of inﬂation, we have assumed
that the inﬂaton and metric perturbations are quantized ﬁelds. By using the equations of
motion to derive expressions for the mode functions and thus the correlation functions, we
have been calculating all relevant inﬂationary observables at the tree level only. However,
higher order radiative corrections may induce a non-negligible correction to the inﬂationary
observables. At this time, the question whether these quantum corrections to cosmological

30

observables are frame-invariant has not yet been resolved [14, 15, 44]. It has been suggested
[11, 14, 45] that the Vilkovisky–DeWitt formalism [16, 17] could be used to solve the frame
problem beyond the tree level approximation. In this section, we will outline how to ex-
tend the frame invariance of the action (2.7) to the eﬀective action, which incorporates the
aforementioned corrections, through the use of the Vilkovisky–DeWitt formalism. We will
explicitly demonstrate this invariance at the one-loop level.

In order to simplify the discussion, we shall make two assumptions: (i) the inﬂaton ﬁeld
does not couple to other matter ﬁelds, even though their inclusion will be straightforward in
the present formalism, and (ii) the radiative corrections coming from the quantized metric
perturbation are negligible in comparison to the quantum inﬂaton corrections. Assumption
(ii) will be suﬃcient in most cases, as quantum gravitational corrections will be O(1/M 2
P ) in
general, and as such they can be ignored in comparison to the quantum inﬂaton corrections.

The quantum-corrected inﬂaton equation of motion and Einstein ﬁeld equations are given

by

δΓ

δΓ

= 0 ,

(8.1)

where δ/δϕ(x) and δ/δgµν(x) are functional derivatives with respect to the ﬁelds ϕ(x) and
gµν(x) respectively, and Γ[gµν, ϕ] ≡ Γ[gµν, ϕ, f (ϕ), k(ϕ), V (ϕ)] is the eﬀective action which
is determined through the functional integro-diﬀerential equation

exp(cid:18) i

Γ[gµν, ϕ](cid:19) = Z DϕQM[ϕQ] exp(cid:18) i

(cid:20)S[gµν, ϕQ] −Z d4x (ϕ − ϕQ)

(8.2)
where DϕQ M[ϕQ] is the path integral measure and S[gµν, ϕ] is the action deﬁned in (2.1).
To obtain an expression for the eﬀective action, we shall solve equation (8.2) pertur-
batively in . To make this process simpler, we may make a ﬁeld transformation of the
quantum ﬁeld ϕQ to ϕ′Q, given by ϕQ = ϕ + 
2 ϕ′Q. We then expand the eﬀective action in
powers of :

1

δΓ[gµν, ϕ]

δϕ

(cid:21)(cid:19) ,

(8.3)

(8.4)

(8.5)

Γ[gµν, ϕ] =

nΓn[gµν, ϕ] .

∞Xn=0

For simplicity, we shall only compute Γ to O(). We ﬁnd

Γ0[gµν, ϕ] = S[gµν, ϕ] ,

Γ1[gµν, ϕ] = lnM[ϕ] −

1
2

δϕ(x)δϕ(y)(cid:19) .
ln det(cid:18) δ2S[gµν, ϕ]

Now that we know the explicit expression for Γ1[gµν, ϕ], we shall examine how it transforms
under inﬂaton reparameterizations and conformal transformations.

Let us ﬁrst consider inﬂaton reparameterizations within the one-loop eﬀective action
Γ1[gµν, ϕ]. For this discussion, we shall denote S[ϕ, k(ϕ)] ≡ S[gµν, ϕ, f (ϕ), k(ϕ), V (ϕ)] and

31

Γ1[ϕ, k(ϕ)] ≡ Γ1[gµν, ϕ, f (ϕ), k(ϕ), V (ϕ)] for brevity, since only ϕ and k(ϕ) are aﬀected by
the inﬂaton reparameterizations. Under the transformations (2.4), we may write Γ1 as

Γ1[ ˜ϕ, ˜k( ˜ϕ)] = ln fM[ ˜ϕ] −

δ ˜ϕ(x)δ ˜ϕ(y)! .
ln det  δ2S[ ˜ϕ, ˜k( ˜ϕ)]

1
2

(8.6)

We wish to relate Γ1[ϕ, k(ϕ)] to Γ1[ ˜ϕ, ˜k( ˜ϕ)]. We ﬁrst examine how the ﬁrst functional
derivative of the action transforms. We obtain

δS[ϕ, k(ϕ)]

δϕ(x)

δS[ ˜ϕ, ˜k( ˜ϕ)]

δ ˜ϕ(x)

(8.7)

where we use (2.6) with Ω = 1 and have denoted Kx ≡ K(ϕ(x)) for brevity. We may now
proceed to determine the transformation of the second functional derivative of the action
which we ﬁnd to be

δ2S[ ˜ϕ, ˜k( ˜ϕ)]
δ ˜ϕ(x)δ ˜ϕ(y)

= K −1/2

2

(ln Kx),ϕ

δS[ϕ, k(ϕ)]

δϕ(x)

δ(x − y)# .

(8.8)

Now that we have found the transformation of the second term in (8.6), let us consider how
the function M[ϕ] transforms under inﬂaton reparametrizations. We will require that the
path integral measure must remain invariant under inﬂaton parameterizations:

(8.9)

(8.10)

and hence this deﬁnes the transformation of M as

DϕQ M[ϕQ] = D ˜ϕQ fM[ϕQ( ˜ϕQ)]
δ(x − y)(cid:1)M[ϕ( ˜ϕ)].
fM[ ˜ϕ] ≡ det(cid:0)K −1/2

x

Consequently, due to the combination of the transformations (8.8) and (8.10), the one-loop
eﬀective action Γ1 is not invariant under inﬂaton reparametrizations:

Γ1[ ˜ϕ, ˜k( ˜ϕ)]

6= Γ1[ϕ, k(ϕ)] .

(8.11)

This result is also consistent with the one observed in [11], by an explicit computation. As
shown in (8.8), the primary source of the frame-dependence is the presence of the functional
derivatives with respect to ϕ(x).
It was the idea of Vilkovisky [16] to extend the eﬀec-
tive action such that it remains invariant under ﬁeld reparameterizations. With subsequent
developments by DeWitt [17], the combined work is now known as the Vilkovisky–DeWitt
formalism. The essential observation is the following.
If the second term in (8.5) trans-
forms covariantly, then the one-loop eﬀective action would remain invariant under inﬂaton
reparametrizations.

32

Let us brieﬂy describe Vilkovisky’s idea. Suppose we identify the ﬁeld ϕ(x) at each
spacetime point x with a coordinate on a manifold. We shall call this manifold the ﬁeld
space. Given this identiﬁcation, it is possible to extend the notion of functional derivatives to
covariant functional derivatives. Denoting the covariant functional derivative by D/Dϕ(x),
we have

D2S

Dϕ(x)Dϕ(y) ≡

δ2S

δϕ(x)δϕ(y) − Γz

xy

δS

δϕ(z)

,

(8.12)

where Γz
xy is the connection and we use the Einstein–DeWitt convention in which repeated
spacetime coordinates are integrated over all spacetime. In this instance, the connection Γz
xy
transforms in a way that ensures that the second covariant functional derivative transforms
covariantly under inﬂaton reparametrizations. To determine the transformation of the con-
nection on the ﬁeld space, we require that it should transform to cancel the second term
inside the brackets in (8.8). This requirement leads to the transformation

xy = K 1/2

z K −1/2

x K −1/2

y

eΓz

(cid:20)Γz

xy −

1
2

(ln Kx),ϕδ(x − y)δ(y − z)(cid:21) .

This ensures that the double covariant functional derivative transforms as

(8.13)

(8.14)

= K −1/2

x K −1/2

y

D2S

Dϕ(x)Dϕ(y)

.

eD2S[ ˜ϕ, ˜k( ˜ϕ)]
eDϕ(x)eDϕ(y)

Given this transformation property, let us now deﬁne a new eﬀective action by replacing the
functional derivatives with covariant functional derivatives in the one-loop eﬀective action
(8.5):

ΓVD

1

[ϕ, k(ϕ)] ≡ lnM[ϕ] −

1
2

Dϕ(x)Dϕ(y)(cid:19) .
ln det(cid:18) D2S[ϕ, k(ϕ)]

(8.15)

This is known as the one-loop Vilkovisky–DeWitt eﬀective action, which can be rigorously
derived by generalizing the source term coupled to the ﬁelds, such that the linear expres-
sion ϕ − ϕQ in (8.2) is replaced with a function σ(ϕ, ϕQ) endowed with speciﬁc proper-
ties [16]. Now, if we make an inﬂaton reparameterization using (8.14) and (8.10), we ﬁnd
that ΓVD

[ ˜ϕ, ˜k( ˜ϕ)] transforms as

1

ΓVD

1

[ ˜ϕ, ˜k( ˜ϕ)] = lnM[ϕ] −

1
2

ln det(cid:18) D2S[k(ϕ), ϕ]

Dϕ(x)Dϕ(y)(cid:19) = ΓVD

1

[ϕ, k(ϕ)] .

(8.16)

Thus, replacing functional derivatives with their covariant counterparts in the usual deﬁni-
tion of the one-loop eﬀective action ensures that the one-loop eﬀective action is unaﬀected
by inﬂaton reparameterizations.

Let us now discuss the form of the measure functional M[ϕ] and the connection Γz
xy.
Taking the analogous case of diﬀerential geometry as an example, one is able to obtain the

33

invariant integral measure and the aﬃne connection in terms of the metric tensor of the
ﬁeld space. From this case, we may construct M[ϕ] and Γz
xy by taking inspiration from
diﬀerential geometry in terms of some metric Gxy for the ﬁeld space. These expressions then
take the form

M[ϕ] ≡ pdet Gxy ,
2Gzw(cid:18) δGwx

Γz
xy ≡

δϕ(y)

1

+

δGwy
δϕ(x) −

δGxy

δϕ(w)(cid:19) ,

(8.17)

(8.18)

where Gzw is the inverse ﬁeld space metric satisfying the relation GywGwx = δ(x − y). We
must now ﬁnd a suitable object to be the metric in the ﬁeld space. To ﬁnd this expression,
observe that the metric and its inverse must transform as

x K −1/2

y

Gxy ,

eGxy = K −1/2

x K 1/2

y Gxy ,

eGxy = K 1/2

(8.19)

in order for the measure and the connection to transform correctly [cf. (8.10), (8.13)]. There
is only one object in the frame-covariant formalism which transforms in this manner: the
inﬂaton wavefunction k(ϕ). Therefore, if we write

then (8.19) is satisﬁed, along with (8.10) and (8.13). With this deﬁnition, we may now ﬁnd
explicit expressions for the measure functional and the connection:

Gxy ≡ k(ϕ) δ(x − y) ,

(8.20)

M[ϕ] = det(cid:0)k1/2(ϕ)δ(x − y)(cid:1) ,

and hence we are able to compute ΓVD

1

Γz

xy =

1

2(cid:0) ln k(ϕ)(cid:1),ϕ δ(x − y)δ(y − z) ,

explicitly as required.

(8.21)

At this point, it is important to note that the path-integral quantization of the theory
from its Hamiltonian, rather its Lagrangian, gives rise to an integral measure M[ϕ] related
In the same context, it
to the ﬁeld-space determinant of the metric Gxy given in (8.20).
is not diﬃcult to check that a free theory for the ﬁeld ϕ, where f (ϕ) = k(ϕ) = 1 and
V (ϕ) = 0, remains a free theory at the one-loop level, without inducing non-renormalizable
ultra-violet inﬁnities at the one-loop level upon an arbitrary ϕ-reparameterization, iﬀ the
integral measure M[ϕ] is chosen as stated in (8.21). Therefore, theoretical consistency of
the path-integral quantization renders the Vilkovisky–DeWitt eﬀective action unique.

Finally, let us brieﬂy discuss the case of conformal transformations.

It was shown in
Section 2 that the action remains invariant under a conformal transformation [cf.
(2.7)
with K = 1]. Furthermore, any functional derivative of the action with respect to ϕ(x)
should also remain invariant under conformal transformations, as the functional derivatives
do not transform themselves. In addition, the measure functional M[ϕ] should not transform
under conformal transformations, as there is no quantized metric perturbation in the path
integral, according to the assumption (ii) stated in the beginning of this section. Hence,
under conformal transformations, we have

Γ1[˜gµν, ϕ, ˜f (ϕ), ˜k(ϕ),eV (ϕ)] = Γ1[gµν, ϕ, f (ϕ), k(ϕ), V (ϕ)] ,

(8.22)

34

which demonstrates the invariance of Γ1 with respect to conformal transformations. How-
ever, the same reasoning, as outlined above, will also apply to the one-loop Vilkovisky-
DeWitt eﬀective action ΓVD
remains invariant under
frame transformations, i.e. the combined action of both conformal transformations and in-
ﬂaton reparametrizations.

. Therefore, we conclude that ΓVD

9. Conclusions

We have presented a frame-covariant formalism of inﬂation in the slow-roll approxi-
mation for a wide class of theories known as scalar-curvature theories. We deﬁned a set
of transformations, known as frame transformations, and under these, we determined the
transformation properties of the model functions: (i) the scalar-curvature coupling function
f (ϕ), (ii) the inﬂaton wavefunction k(ϕ), and (iii) the inﬂaton potential V (ϕ). Consequently,
we were able to show that both the classical action and its functional form remain invariant
under frame transformations [cf. (2.7)], assuming that the model functions f (ϕ), k(ϕ) and
V (ϕ) transform according to (2.6). By generalizing the inﬂationary attractor solution, we
have derived a new set of potential slow-roll parameters stated in (5.24). Through these
new parameters, we have found that inﬂationary observables, such as the power spectrum,
the spectral indices and their runnings, can all be expressed in a concise manner in terms of
the generalized potential slow-roll parameters and their ϕ-derivatives, which in turn depend
explicitly on the model functions f (ϕ), k(ϕ), and V (ϕ).

In addition to obtaining concise expressions for the cosmological observables, we also
utilised the potential slow-roll parameters deﬁned in (5.24) to examine the eﬀect of frame
transformations on these observables in a simple manner. We have displayed that the tensor-
to-scalar ratio r, the spectral indices nR and nT , and their runnings αR and αT , are frame-
invariant within this generalized potential slow-roll formalism, as long as the end-of-inﬂation
condition is uniquely extended to be frame invariant as given in (6.13). A direct consequence
of this formalism is that one does not need to transform to the Einstein frame to utilise the
potential slow-roll approximation; we have explicitly shown that this formalism reduces to
the potential slow-roll approximation in the Einstein frame in Section 6.3.

To demonstrate the use of the advertised formalism, we then apply it to speciﬁc scenarios,
such as the induced gravity inﬂation, Higgs inﬂation and Starobinsky-like F (R) models.
This application led to results for the cosmological observables which were more exact in
comparison to those already presented in the literature without the need to go to the Einstein
frame; our results were found to be consistent to lowest order in 1/N, the reciprocal of the
number of e-folds, with those presented in the literature.

Finally, we have outlined how our frame-covariant formalism can be naturally extended
beyond the tree-level approximation within the framework of the Vilkovisky–DeWitt eﬀective
action. Speciﬁcally, we have explicitly demonstrated how the one-loop Vilkovisky–DeWitt
eﬀective action, which is written in terms of functional derivatives of the classical action,
may be made invariant under inﬂaton reparametrizations. The Vilkovisky–DeWitt formal-
ism is therefore the natural starting point to begin an analysis of the so-called frame problem,

35

in addition to the study of the radiative corrections to cosmological observables and their
consolidation with the slow-roll approximation. It is the authors’ opinion that this is an im-
portant milestone towards the solution of the frame problem, and we hope to report progress
on this issue using the Vilkovisky–DeWitt formalism in a forthcoming communication.

Appendix A. The Inﬂaton Action under Frame Transformations

In this appendix, we derive the transformation properties given in (2.6) for the model
functions f (ϕ), k(ϕ) and V (ϕ) describing the classical action S of inﬂationary scalar-
curvature theories [cf. (2.1)], under a frame transformation. As deﬁned in Section 2, a
frame transformation consists of a conformal transformation (2.2) and an inﬂaton reparam-
eterization (2.4).

To start with, we ﬁrst consider the classical action (2.1) in the Jordan frame

S[gµν, ϕ, f, k, V ] ≡ Z d4x√−g (cid:20)−

f
2

R +

k
2

gµν(∇µϕ)(∇νϕ) − V (cid:21) ,

(A.1)

where we have suppressed the implicit dependence of the model functions f , k and V on
ϕ. Under the conformal transformation (2.2), R transforms according to (2.3). As a conse-
quence, S changes to

S[gµν, ϕ, f, k, V ] =Z d4x√−g (cid:20)−

f

2(cid:16)Ω2eR + 6 Ω−1gµν∇µ∇νΩ(cid:17) +

k
2

gµν(∂µϕ)(∂νϕ) − V(cid:21) .

(A.2)

Our next step is to rewrite S in terms of ˜gµν = Ω2gµν as follows:

S[gµν, ϕ, f, k, V ] = Z d4x(cid:26)p−˜g(cid:20) −

eR +
− 3f Ω−1∂µ(√−ggµν∇νΩ)(cid:27) .

2

Ω−2f

k
2

Ω−2 ˜gµν(∂µϕ)(∂νϕ) − Ω−4V(cid:21)

(A.3)

Then, we make use of the following identity:

f Ω−1∂µ(√−g gµν∇νΩ) = ∂µ[f Ω−1√−ggµν∇νΩ] − √−g gµν∇µ[f Ω−1]∇νΩ .

(A.4)

Substituting (A.4) into (A.3), we may neglect the total derivative on the RHS of (A.4),
upon total integration in the action. In addition, we assume that Ω and ϕ are tempered
functions that are locally Lorentz invariant and so they both depend on x2 ≡ xµxµ. Thus,
the conformal factor Ω depends implicitly on the inﬂaton ϕ, i.e. Ω = Ω[ϕ(x)], entailing that
the coordinate covariant derivative ∇µΩ can be converted into ∇µϕ through the chain rule:
(A.5)

∇µΩ = Ω,ϕ ∇µϕ .

By virtue of (A.5), the action S in (A.3) becomes

S[gµν, ϕ, f, k, V ] = Z d4xp−˜g(cid:26) −

Ω−2f

2

Ω−2

2K h k + 6 Ω,ϕ(cid:16)Ω−1f,ϕ − f Ω−2Ω,ϕ(cid:17)i ˜gµν(∇µ ˜ϕ)(∇ν ˜ϕ) − Ω−4V(cid:27) ,

(A.6)

˜f ( ˜ϕ) = Ω−2 f ,

˜k( ˜ϕ) =

,ϕ + 6 Ω−1f,ϕ Ω,ϕ(cid:17) ,

(A.7)

(2.6)

(A.8)

where ˜ϕ = ˜ϕ(ϕ) represents an arbitrary reparameterization of the original inﬂaton ﬁeld ϕ,
which is determined by the Jacobian squared: K = K(ϕ) = (d ˜ϕ/dϕ)2 [cf. (2.4)].

We now observe that the last expression of the action in (A.6) can be brought into the

form:

S[˜gµν, ˜ϕ, ˜f , ˜k,eV ] = Z d4xp−˜g(cid:20) −

˜f
2

R +

˜k
2

˜gµν(∇µ ˜ϕ)(∇ν ˜ϕ) − eV (cid:21) ,

after making the following identiﬁcations for the transformed model functions:

Notice that the tilted model functions are evaluated at ˜ϕ, which is achieved by expressing
ϕ as ϕ = ϕ( ˜ϕ), e.g.

˜f ( ˜ϕ) = Ω−2[ϕ( ˜ϕ)] f [ϕ( ˜ϕ)] .

Evidently, the latter ensures that the actions (A.1) and (A.7) are equal, exhibiting the same
functional dependence [cf. (2.7)]. We may now specialize the frame transformations (2.6), so
as to go to the Einstein frame. This is accomplished by choosing Ω2 = f , such that ˜f = 1,
and the squared Jacobian K, such that the inﬂaton kinetic term becomes canonical, with
˜k = 1.
