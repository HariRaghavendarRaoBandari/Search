Nonsymmorphic symmetries like screws and glides produce electron band touchings, obstructing the forma-
tion of a band insulator and leading instead to metals or nodal semimetals even when the number of electrons in
the unit cell is an even integer. Here we calculate the electron ﬁllings compatible with being a band insulator for
all 230 space groups, for noninteracting electrons with time-reversal symmetry. Our bounds are tight – that is
we can rigorously eliminate band insulators at any forbidden ﬁlling, and produce explicit models for all allowed
ﬁllings – and stronger than those recently established for interacting systems. These results provide simple cri-
teria that should help guide the search for topological semimetals and also have implications for both the nature
and stability of the resulting nodal Fermi surfaces.

INTRODUCTION

When is a system of electrons insulating?

For non-
interacting electrons in the presence of time-reversal (TR)
symmetry, standard band theory consideration dictates that a
band insulator is possible only if the electron ﬁlling ν, deﬁned
as the average number of electrons per primitive unit cell, is
an even integer. Since all crystals possess space group sym-
metries, it is of fundamental importance to ask whether the
ﬁlling constraints are tightened due to the crystal structure,
i.e. do the extra spatial symmetries forbid band insulators even
when ν ∈ 2N? Indeed, when spin-orbit coupling is negligible,
it has long been established that nonsymmorphic symmetries
can enforce certain patterns of band degeneracies and lead to
tighter ﬁlling constraints [1, 2].

Recent advances in the understanding of topological phases
of matter have rekindled the interest in the interplay between
electron ﬁlling and electronic phases of matter. When the
electrons are weakly-correlated and amenable to a band theory
description, as in ab initio density-functional-theory studies,
numerous recent works have pointed out that the known ﬁlling
constraints arising from nonsymmorphic symmetries survive
even when spin-rotation invariance is broken due to spin-orbit
coupling. Such systems at appropriate ﬁlling tend to favor
nodal semimetals, which are electronic systems with Fermi
surfaces of reduced dimensionality and consequentially fea-
ture low-energy excitations with unconventional dispersion.

Similar ﬁlling constraints have also been derived for inter-
acting systems using various non-perturbative methods [3–8],
with each generalization relaxing some of the symmetry con-
straints originally imposed. However, none of the previous
works provide tight constraints for all 230 space groups - in
our recent work on interacting systems [8], we could only
prove the tightness of the ﬁlling constraints for 218 of the 230
space groups. That is, for the remaining 12 space groups at
certain ﬁllings, there was neither a general argument forbid-
ding an insulator, nor an explicit construction of an insulating
ground state.

Here we report the results from a comprehensive study of
ﬁlling obstructions to realizing band insulators, with or with-
out spin-orbit coupling, for all 230 space groups assuming TR

invariance. Our key result is summarized in Tables I and II,
which tabulate the electron ﬁllings SBIG compatible with a TR-
symmetric band insulator in any given space group G. Com-
pared to the interacting results presented in Ref. [8], the cur-
rent work serves as an independent veriﬁcation of the tight ﬁll-
ing constraints for 218 space groups using band theory analy-
sis, and provides the tight bounds for the remaining 12 space
groups in the non-interacting limit.

Before we move on to present the results we comment on
how such tight ﬁlling constraints for all possible crystal struc-
tures should be useful for materials design and screening. Any
material with a ﬁlling ν (cid:54)∈ SBIG is necessarily (semi-)metallic
or Mott-insulating. The results also apply to quasi-2D sys-
tems, since any 2D layer group can be viewed as a ‘slice’ of
a 3D space groups [9]. The tightened ﬁlling constraints for
nonsymmorphic space groups, which rule out band insulators
at certain even ﬁllings (say at ν = 2), can be used to iden-
tify systems that are necessarily gapless. At the same time,
since the Luttinger volume of a system with, say, ν = 2 is
zero, no Fermi surfaces are required. The simplest Fermi-
ology that has vanishing Luttinger volume, but at the same
time is not an insulator, is a nodal point. Such systems are
attractive candidates for realizing nodal semimetals, although
we should note that other outcomes involving compensated
Fermi surfaces are also admissible. Therefore the tight ﬁll-
ing constraints we presented should be viewed as a general
guide to help narrow down the search space to materials with
a combination of space group symmetries and ﬁllings that nat-
urally favor nodal semimetal ground states. Actually, it may
be worth noting that in spin-orbit-coupled systems lacking in-
version symmetry, a similar argument on the Fermiology ap-
plies even when ν = 2n + 1. While conventionally this ﬁll-
ing is associated with a large Fermi surface, encompassing
half the Brillouin zone, in the presence of spin-orbit coupling
the individual spin components cannot be distinguished, and
the Luttinger volume constraint only applies to the total num-
ber of electrons. Hence one could in principle realize a nodal
semimetal at such ﬁllings. However, if spin-orbit coupling is
negligible or when the crystal is centrosymmetric, each band
is doubly degenerate and the Luttinger’s count is effectively
halved [7, 10, 11]. Consequentially, unless both spatial inver-
sion and spin-rotation symmetries are strongly broken, such

systems typically possess two big Fermi surfaces each enclos-
ing approximately half of the ﬁrst Brillouin zone.

Let us mention some examples of existing materials that
illustrate how our results apply. The proposed nodal-ring
semimetal SrIrO3 [12], which has a topologically protected
nodal Fermi surface [13], is in fact an example of a nodal
semimetal with ﬁlling ν = 4. For this space group (62)
however, the allowed band insulator ﬁllings as obtained from
Table I are SBI
62 = 8N, hence the necessity of at least nodal
points at the lower ﬁlling. Now consider the stability of this
nodal structure to a symmetry-lowering distortion G → G(cid:48)
with SBIG = SBIG(cid:48), the nodal Fermi surface is guaranteed to
be protected from a full gapping out, although it can change
from, say, a collection of nodal lines to nodal points. Con-
versely, if ν ∈ SBIG(cid:48) a band insulator, possibly nontrivial, is in
principle achievable via such distortion.

Understanding the nature of the enforced band degenera-
cies, the symmetry-topology protection of the nodal Fermi
surfaces, and the class of nontrivial band insulators accessi-
ble by symmetry-lowering are interesting open problems, as is
the actual prediction of new materials candidates using these
insights. Another promising future direction is the extension
of the results to magnetic space groups, pertinent for systems

with magnetic ordering. As pointed out above, for 12 space
groups we could only prove tightness of the ﬁlling constraints
in the non-interacting limit.
It remains an interesting open
problem whether interaction will enable trivial insulators at a
lower ﬁlling in these systems.

II.

IDENTIFICATION OF SPECIAL SPACE GROUPS.

We start by identifying some simple rules that reduce the
analysis to a small number of special space groups. Consider
a class of system X satisfying certain deﬁning properties, like
space group symmetries and the validity of a band theory de-
scription. We will be interested in SX, the set of electron
ﬁllings (deﬁned with primitive unit cell) for which a band in-
sulator in class X is possible. Imagine a ‘less constrained’
class X(cid:48) for which we lift some of the constraints imposed
on X. Suppose a band insulator lies in class X, then by def-
inition it also lies in class X(cid:48). The converse, however, is not
necessarily true, and so the sets of ﬁlling constraints satisfy
SX ⊆ SX(cid:48) provided the ﬁlling is deﬁned with respect to the
same unit cell on the two sides.

Such relations will greatly reduce the work required to
establish the band insulator (BI) ﬁlling bounds for all 230
space groups. For instance, if space group G(cid:48) is a subgroup
of G, then systems symmetric under G(cid:48) belong to a ‘less-
constrained’ class compared to those symmetric under G. In
general, however, G(cid:48) and G may have different unit cell vol-
umes. To ensure fair comparison we have to weigh the two
sides by the relative volumes of their primitive unit cells,
vG,G(cid:48) = |TG/TG(cid:48)| ≥ 1, i.e.

for G(cid:48) ⊂ G,

SBIG ⊆ SBIG(cid:48)/vG,G(cid:48)

(1)
where TG(cid:48) (cid:67)TG are the respective lattice translation subgroups
of G(cid:48) and G. For instance, if G differs from G(cid:48) only by a body-
centered translation, we have vG,G(cid:48) = 2.

Atomic insulators (AI) are special instances of band insu-
lators in which each electron is tightly localized to a single
atomic orbital, or which can be smoothly deformed to such a
conﬁguration while preserving the symmetries. This is a re-
striction on the phase, and so for the same space group G

SAIG ⊆ SBIG ,

(2)
establishing a useful ‘lower’ bound. By composing the rela-
tions of Eq. (1) and Eq. (2), we can obtain bounds of the form
SAIG ⊆ SBIG ⊆ SBIG(cid:48)/vG,G(cid:48). Whenever SAIG = SBIG(cid:48)/vG,G(cid:48) for
some G(cid:48) ⊆ G, we have SBIG = SAIG , which is consequently the
tight constraint.
At ﬁrst sight, it may appear nontrivial to deduce SBIG from
this approach, since (i) one would still need to determine SAIG ,
and (ii) there are numerous sub-space groups G(cid:48) for any space
group G, and it is unclear which G(cid:48) will provide maximal
information about SBIG . Fortunately (i) can be accomplished
with little effort: by deﬁnition a TR-symmetric atomic insu-
lator can be smoothly deformed into a phase with Kramers
pairs of electrons localized to well-deﬁned points in space,
and these points must form a space-group symmetric lattice
(Appendix A). Such lattices are classiﬁed under the ‘Wyckoff
positions’, which are exhaustively tabulated in Ref. [14]. Each
Wyckoff position WG
w (w = a, b, . . . ) corresponds to a lattice
with some number of points within each primitive unit cell,
: w = a, b, . . .}. Thus the set of
w|
which we denote {|WG
ﬁllings SAIG is spanned by adding together arbitrary multiples
w|.
of 2|WG

For (ii), we take advantage of nonsymmorphic symme-
tries which generally require extra band crossings and lead
to tighter bounds on SBIG [2]. A space group G can con-
tain multiple nonsymmorphic elements, and to systemati-
cally study their effects we ﬁrst consider SBI
Γ , where Γ <
G contains only nonsymmorphic elements and lattice trans-
lations. When acting on R3 such groups are ﬁxed-point
free, and are known as ‘Bieberbach’ groups. Up to chiral-
ity there are only 10 such space groups in 3D [14]: 1, 4,
7, 9, 19, 29, 33, 76(P 41)∼78(P 43), 144(P 31)∼145(P 32),
169(P 61)∼170(P 65). (To avoid possible confusions, we de-
note a speciﬁc space group by its space group number used in
Ref. [14] in the bold italic face.)

Γ = SBI

In Appendix C, we establish that SAI

Γ for each of the
10 Bieberbach groups (Table II). The 10 Bieberbach groups
then serve as an anchor for most of the analysis. In particular,
for many space groups G there exists a Bieberbach subgroup
Γ ≤ G satisfying SAIG = SBI
Γ /vG,Γ, which therefore estab-
lishes a tight bound on SBIG . In fact, determining SAIG and SBI
allows us to derive SBIG for 218 out of the 230 space groups
(entries in Table II with SAIG = SBIG = ∩Γ≤G(SBI
Γ /vG,Γ)).
The 12 remaining space groups require a case-by-case study,
though there are still group-subgroup relations among them
that we can use to our advantage (Appendix D). With that, our
main result can be tersely summarized as follows:
For spinful electrons symmetric under both TR and a space
group G, SBIG = SAIG unless G belongs to one of the following
four exceptions: 199, 214, 220 and 230.
The four exceptions above allow for topologically nontriv-
ial band insulators even when no atomic insulator is possible

at the same ﬁlling, and they all have interesting structures in
the multiplicities of their Wyckoff positions. We refer to them
as ‘Wyckoff-mismatched space groups’ and their properties
are the focus of another study [15].

Lastly, we address the case of systems with SU(2) spin-
rotation invariance, relevant when spin-orbit coupling is neg-
ligible. The ﬁlling constraints satisfy

SAIG×SU(2) ⊆ SBIG×SU(2) ⊆ SBIG .

(3)
Since each entry in SAIG corresponds to localizing an even
number of electrons on each site, one can as well imag-
ine putting them into a spin-singlet wavefunction,
i.e.
SAIG×SU(2) = SAIG . Again by composing these relations, we
have SBIG×SU(2) = SBIG whenever SBIG = SAIG . Hence, to estab-
lish the complete list of SBIG×SU(2) one simply studies the four
Wyckoff-mismatched space groups. It turns out that
For spinful electrons symmetric under TR, a space group G,
and spin SU(2) rotation, SBIG×SU (2) = SAIG for all 230 space
groups.

III. BAND THEORETICAL ANALYSIS FOR 73

We have reduced the analysis to that of the 10 ﬁxed-point
free space groups Γ, and the 12 space groups for which knowl-
edge on Γ alone does not guarantee tightness of the bounds on
SBIG . The ﬁlling constraints for some of these space groups,
like those with a single screw or glide, have been derived in
the literature [2, 13, 16–24]. As brieﬂy reviewed in Appendix
B, the main strategy is to derive the little group irreducible
representations (irreps) at the high symmetry momenta, and
then study the compatibility between irreps connected by high
symmetry lines. Such analysis, however, can become quite
technical when the space group possesses a larger number of
symmetries. Instead of presenting all the arguments for the
10 + 12 space groups mentioned above, here we focus only
on 73, which illustrates the key ingredients needed to derive
ﬁlling constraints for a space group with multiple nonsym-
morphic symmetries and extra point group symmetries. We
refer the interested readers to Appendices C and D for a de-
tailed discussion on all the other space groups and the cases
with spin-rotation invariance.

73 (Ibca) is centrosymmetric (i.e., contains the spatial in-
version P ) and belongs to the body-centered orthorhombic
system. It is generated by P and (two of the) three orthog-
onal screws Sα ≡ Tτα Rα,π with α = x, y, z. Rα,θ repre-
sents the anti-clockwise rotation by angle θ around the posi-
tive α-axis; Tt represents the translation by t, where for the
screws we have τx = (1/2, 1/2, 0), τy = (0, 1/2, 1/2) and
τz = (1/2, 0, 1/2).

We ﬁrst study the constraints arising from the screws. Sz is
a symmetry of the Bloch states along the line k = (π, π, kz),
which connects two high-symmetry points k = (π, π, 0) (a
TRIM) and (π, π, π) (not a TRIM due to the body-centered
z = T(0,0,1)Rz,2π and 2π-rotation is −1
structure). Since S2

Here we present an alternative derivation of SBIG by deﬁning
the system on a nontrivial ﬂat manifold. For simplicity we
illustrate the main idea using G = 73 as an example, and a
more general discussion is presented in Appendix E.
Suppose we are given a system of spinful electrons in R3
symmetric under G = 73. Let us imagine putting the sys-
tem on one of the 10 compact ﬂat manifolds in 3D. The most
familiar example of such manifolds is the torus, which can
be obtained by imposing periodic boundary conditions.
In
doing so, we (implicitly) take a translation subgroup Γ(0)
α , and identify r ∈ R3 by
of 73 generated by T L
r ∼ r + L(l, m, n), with the two sides related by any
ˆz = TL(l,m,n) ∈ Γ(0). Here, L is the linear di-

mension of the torus R3/Γ(0) and should be chosen much
larger than the microscopic lattice constant 1. To deﬁne the
Hamiltonian on the torus, we also need to identify electronic

Replacing Γ(0) by other ﬁxed-point-free subgroup of 73 al-
lows one to deﬁne the system on a nontrivial ﬂat manifold.
Here we choose a subgroup Γ of 73 generated by

as before, i.e. r ∼ γ(r) for all γ ∈ Γ, and this gives the ﬂat

however, nontrivial

Here {Ug : g ∈ G} is a unitary representation of G, and in
contrast to the torus case Uγ (cid:54)= 1 in general. What is slightly
complicated here is that the electron’s spin transforms pro-
jectively under spatial symmetries, i.e., UgUg(cid:48) = ωg,g(cid:48)Ugg(cid:48)
for g, g(cid:48) ∈ G, and Ug intrinsically possesses sign ambigu-
ity. For example, π-rotation about the α-axis can be repre-
2 σα = ±iσα. To consistently iden-
sented by either of e±iπ 1
tify operators, we need to ﬁx the phase of Ug in such a way
that {Uγ : γ ∈ Γ} is a linear (non-projective) representa-
tion of Γ ⊂ G. Such a choice of sign is always possible
in 3D if Γ is ﬁxed-point free [25]. For the current problem,
one can freely choose USα = ±iσα, but we always require
UTα = U 2
Sα

The argument presented so far uses only the Bieberbach
subgroup Γ and does not rely on the non-interacting assump-
tion. Indeed the interacting bounds we presented in Ref. [8]
coincide with SBI
Γ for all space groups. As shown in Table II,
however, SBIG (cid:54)= SBI
Γ for 10 space groups including 73. To de-
rive the tight, non-interacting bounds for them one must utilize
the other space group symmetries differentiating G from Γ.
Generally, an element g in G but not in Γ may not remain a
symmetry on M. The necessary and sufﬁcient condition for

to ξx,kx and ξy,ky.

Now suppose there exists a band insulator at ν = 2, and we
focus on the symmetry representation at (π, π, π). On the one
hand, the preceding discussion implies the two bands have op-
α,π = −1. On the other hand, the screw
posite ξα,π, i.e. ξ(1)
eigenvalues of a single band are constrained by the group re-
lations: As space group elements SxSySz = 1, but on single-
electron states the same relation becomes ˆSx ˆSy ˆSz = −ˆ1.

vention on Rα,θ.) The symmetry eigenvalues therefore satisfy

combination of P and T leads to doubly degenerate bands ev-
erywhere in the Brillouin zone. In particular PT commutes
with Sα at (π, π, π), and hence the bands paired by PT have
the same ξ(l)
α,π. The previous argument can then be applied to
half of the bands (one from each pair). Combined with the
observation that SAI

73 = 8N, we conclude SBI

73 = 8N.

In addition to B and P , the TR symmetry T ( ˆT 2 = (−1) ˆF )
is also a remnant symmetry, and it still commutes with B and
P . This algebra requires a four-fold degeneracy in the single
particle spectrum, and hence we need 4n electrons on M to
realize a band insulator. Now suppose the electron ﬁlling is
ν. Since the volume of M is L3/2 (in units of the primitive
unit cell), a band insulator is possible only if νL3/2 ∈ 4N.
Recalling L is odd, one concludes SBI
73 = 8N. Note that the
nontriviality of the algebra hinges on (−1) ˆF = −1 when act-
ing on single-particle states, and therefore the obstruction can
in principle be circumvented in the presence of interaction.

V. CONCLUSION

In this work we have reported the full list of ﬁlling con-
straints for a TR and space-group symmetric system of elec-
trons to realize a band insulator, with or without spin-rotation
invariance. The bounds are established through a comprehen-
sive symmetry analysis of electronic band structures. We have
also outlined a novel way to study symmetry-enforced gap-
lessness by deﬁning the system on compatible ﬂat manifolds,
a generalization of the conventional torus geometry.

Here we present the detail of the derivation of SAIG for each
Given a lattice compatible with the space group G, one can
realize a symmetric TR and space-group symmetric AI by lo-
calizing a singlet pair of electrons per site. The ﬁlling ν of the
AI is hence twice the number of lattice sites in the unit cell.

As there may be several lattices for a single G, we have to
classify distinct lattice types systematically. This is precisely
what ‘Wyckoff positions’ do.
In general, every lattice consistent with G can be under-
stood as a ‘crystallographic orbit’ of an arbitrary point r0 in
the lattice:

ΛG

r0

= {g(r0)| g ∈ G}.

(A1)

The structure of the lattice is speciﬁed by the ‘site symme-
try group’ of r0, which is the subgroup of G that leaves r0
unmoved:

Gr0 ≡ {g ∈ G | g(r0) = r0}.

(A2)

0

0

r0 and ΛG
r(cid:48)

= gGr0 g−1.

The larger Gr0 is, the fewer number of sites of ΛG
r0 are there in
a unit cell. The choice of r0 for a given lattice is not unique;
0 = g(r0) (g ∈ G) instead, the site symmetry
if one choose r(cid:48)
group will just be conjugated, i.e. Gr(cid:48)
A Wyckoff position groups several lattices in terms of the
site symmetry group. Namely, two lattices ΛG
are
of the same type and belong to the same Wyckoff position if
the site symmetry group of r0 and r(cid:48)
0 are conjugate with each
other: ∃g ∈ G such that Gr(cid:48)
= gGr0g−1. Therefore, in what
follows, we use Wyckoff positions to refer to a speciﬁc lattice
type. One can ﬁnd a full list of Wyckoff positions WG

by the Wyckoff letter w = a, b, c . . ., for each space group in
Ref. [14].

As explained above, one can realize a symmetric AI at ﬁll-

The exceptions are the four ‘Wyckoff-mismatched’ space
groups (199, 214, 220, and 230). For example, 199 has three

an AI at ﬁlling ν = 8na + 12nb + 24nc (na, nb, nc ∈ N),
which altogether form a set 4N \ {4} ≡ {8, 12, 16, 20 . . .}.
Other three space groups can be discussed in the same way.

Appendix B: Representations of Bloch states

1. Little Group Representations

As preparation for the band theoretical analysis in the next
section, here we review the little group representation of a
space group G.
Let us write a symmetry element g ∈ G as g = {pg|tg}
when g(r) = pgr + tg. In general, g = {pg|tg} changes the
lattice momentum k to pgk. The subgroup of G that preserves
k up to reciprocal lattice vectors G is called the little group of
k (or the k-group):

Gk ≡ {g ∈ G|pgk = k + ∃G}.

(B1)
Since the single particle Hamiltonian Hk is invariant under
Gk, Bloch states in general form a representation of Gk [26].
By decomposing the representation into ‘irreps’ (irreducible
representations), one can obtain crucial information about the
band structure such as the degeneracy at k. Therefore, it is im-
portant to know all the irreps of Gk. It is however troublesome
to examine Gk itself since Gk is an inﬁnite group because of
its lattice translation subgroup T ∼ Zd. Hence, as a step to
derive irreps of Gk, one can discuss a ﬁnite group Pk ≡ Gk/T
instead.

There are two origins that make relevant representations of
Pk generically projective. Let uk(p) be the representation of
p ∈ Pk, then uk(p)uk(p(cid:48)) = ωk(p, p(cid:48))uk(pp(cid:48)) for p, p(cid:48) ∈ Pk.
See Sec. F for the review of projective representations.
The ﬁrst origin is the electron spin. When acting on spatial
coordinates, we express p as p = e−iL·θp for proper rotations
and p = −e−iL·θp for improper rotations using the three-
dimensional matrix representation of the angular momentum
L. (θp is of course ambiguous but we arbitrarily choose and
ﬁx it for each p.) L above is replaced by σ (the vector of
Pauli matrices) when p acts on electron spin. The factor sys-
tem arising from the spin can be computed by

i

2 σ·θpp(cid:48) = ±1.

z(p, p(cid:48)) ≡ e− i

2 σ·θp e− i

2 σ·θp(cid:48) e

(B2)
The second origin is the non-symmorphic nature of Gk.
When the space group is symmorphic, one can always set
tg = 0 modulo lattice translations for all g ∈ G by properly
choosing the origin. This is not the case for non-symmorphic
space groups and nonzero tg results in a factor system

g k)·tg(cid:48) .

ρk(pg, pg(cid:48)) ≡ eik·(tg(cid:48)−pgtg(cid:48) ) = ei(k−p−1

(B3)
As we are discussing Pk = Gk/T rather than Gk, tg(cid:48) in
Eq. (B3) is deﬁned only up to a primitive lattice vector. How-
ever, this ambiguity does not affect ρ(pg, pg(cid:48)) since k − p−1
g k
is a reciprocal lattice vector G. If k is inside of the Brillouin
zone, k − p−1

g k = 0 and ρk = 1.

The factor system ωk above is the product of z and ρk,

ωk(p, p(cid:48)) ≡ z(p, p(cid:48))ρk(p, p(cid:48)).

k (gg(cid:48)), g, g(cid:48) ∈ Gk.(B5)

2. Time-Reversal Symmetry

In addition to the space group G, we assume that the system
has time-reversal symmetry T . In general, T is represented
by a unitary matrix UT followed by the complex conjugation
K. UT is antisymmetric when T 2 = −1. Furthermore, since
g ∈ G and T commute, we need

UT U∗

k(g)U−1T = Uk(g)

(B6)

for all g ∈ G a TRIMs.

3. Spin SU(2) rotation

A space group element g ∈ G permutes the coordinate r
of electrons and at the same time rotates the spin of electrons.
In the presence of spin-rotation symmetry, we can ‘undo’ the
spin rotation part of g by using the corresponding element of
SU(2). Therefore the relevant band theory effectively reduces
to the one for spinless electrons. Consequently, one should
set z(p, p(cid:48)) = 1 in the above equations.

Appendix C: Band theory derivation of SBIG for 10 ﬁxed-point

free space groups Γ

Here we present band theoretical derivation of SBIG for the
10 ﬁxed-point-free (i.e. Bieberbach) space groups in Table IV.
In the following we argue SBI
Γ ⊆ 2|Γ/T|N, and tightness of
the bounds are all established by comparing the results with
SAI
Γ .

1. Bieberbach space groups with a single screw or glide

Let us start with those space groups which have only a nm-
screw axis or a glide in addition to lattice translations. This
class includes 7 of the 10 ﬁxed-point-free groups. The re-
maining three, 19, 29, and 33, are discussed later separately.
To discuss these space groups at once, we choose the prim-
itive lattice vector a1,2,3 in such a way that (i) the screw or the
glide g is represented as

g = e−i(m/n)P ·a1 X.

(C1)

Here, X is the rotation about an axis parallel to a1 for nm-
screws, or the mirror about a plane that contains a1 for a glide
(where m/n = 1/2). (ii) The plane spanned by a2 and a3
is invariant under ˆX. For these elementary groups, one can
check case by case that such a choice is possible. g is then a
symmetry of the single-particle Hamiltonian hk along the line

k = κb1,

κ ∈ [−0.5, 0, 5],

(C2)

and so one can simultaneously diagonalize hk and g.
For example, in the case of 21-screw for 4, g2 is 2π-rotation
followed by translation e−iP ·a1. Thus, g must be represented
by

Uk(g)2 = (−1) × e−ik·a1 = −e−2πiκ

(C3)

for spinful electrons. There are two 1D reps along this line:

U (±)
k (g) = ±ie−πiκ.

(C4)

k

k

k

κ=−0.5 = U (∓)

If one tracks U (±)
as κ increases from −0.5 to +0.5, one ﬁnds
that they acquire a negative sign and the two representations
interchange with each other: U (±)
κ=+0.5. However,
κ = −0.5 and +0.5 are the same point in BZ. The only reso-
and U (−)
lution is that the same number of U (+)
appear and
intersect with each other somewhere along this line.
Furthermore, since time-reversal T and g commute, a
Kramers pair at a TRIM must have eigenvalues of g that are
complex conjugate to each other. At κ = 0.5, however,
k (g) = ±1 is real and thus there must be 2n copies of
U (+)
U (+)
to form Kramers pairs. Since there must be an equal
number of bands corresponding to U (−)
k , one can conclude
any set of isolated bands must contain 4n bands.

Other space groups with a single screw can be argued in a
similar manner. The same argument can also be applied to 7
and 9, which contain a single glide (a mirror followed by a half
translation). This is because the mirror operation by a plane
normal to n is deﬁned as π-rotation around n followed by the
3D inversion. Since the inversion does not transform spin at
all, the discussion is unchanged from the 21-screw case.

2. Bieberbach space groups with more than one

nonsymmorphic elements

Now we discuss the slightly more nontrivial examples for
which the optimal bound can only be found by considering
more than one symmetry operations.

a. 19

The condition for 19 can actually be deduced from our
discussion on 73 presented in the main text. 19 belongs to
the primitive orthorhombic system and the momentum k =
(π, π, π) is invariant under T . Therefore, one can simply use
T at k = (π, π, π), instead of the combined symmetry PT in
the main text, to form Kramer’s pairing of the four intersecting
band. Therefore, SBI

19 ⊆ 8N.

b.

29 and 33

Both 29 (P ca21) and 33 (P na21) can be viewed as the
combination of a 21 screw along the z-axis and a glide about
the x-z plane. They contain the symmetry elements:

Sz ≡ T(0,0,1/2)Rz,π,
Gy ≡ T(1/2,τy,0)My,
Gx ≡T(1/2,τy,1/2)Mx,

(C5)
(C6)
(C7)

where the mirror My = P Ry,π (recall P denotes spatial in-
version) is about x-z plane, and Mx is similarly deﬁned. Note
α = −1 when acting on single-particle states. τy = 0
that M 2
and 1/2 respectively for 29 and 33. The following argument
does not depend on the value of τy, and therefore applies
equally well to 29 and 33.

8

Along the line k = (kx, 0, π), Gy is a symmetry and since
y = −e−ikx. At
y = T(1,0,0), the eigenvalue of Gy satisﬁes ξ2
G2
the TRIM (0, 0, π), ξy = ±i and the two bands in a Kramer’s
doublet have conjugate ξy. When these bands are evolved to
(π, 0, π), they have ξy = ±1 and therefore the number of
bands at (π, 0, π) with ξy = 1 equals to that with ξy = −1.

z = T(0,0,1) and G2

A similar argument applies to the line k = (π, 0, kz). Here
x = T(0,2τy,1), and there-
we observe S2
x = −e−ikz.
fore the respective eigenvalues satisfy ξ2
Combined with the argument in the preceding paragraph, we
conclude that at (π, 0, π) the number of bands with ξα = +1
is the same as that with ξα = −1 for α = x, y, z.

z = ξ2

In addition, the eigenvalues of a single band at (π, 0, π) sat-
isfy ξzξyξx = 1. This gives four 1D irreps: (ξz, ξy, ξx) =
(1, 1, 1), (1,−1,−1), (−1, 1,−1) or (−1,−1, 1). Similar
to the argument presented in the discussion for 73 in the
main text, the requirements of equal number of bands having
ξα = ±1 implies all four 1D irreps appear the same number
of times in a set of isolated bands. Further noticing each of
these 1D irreps is paired with another copy of itself under TR,
we conclude SBIG ⊆ 8N for G = 29 and 33.

Appendix D: Band theoretical derivation of SBIG for remaining

space groups

In the main text, we explained that the combinations of SAIG
Γ (Γ < G) are sufﬁcient to set SBIG = SAIG for 218 out of

and SBI
230 space groups.

Among the 12 remaining space groups, let us ﬁrst focus on

the following eight space groups:

73, 106, 110, 133, 135, 142, 206, and 228.

It turns out they all satisfy SBIG = SAIG = 8N. The remaining 4
space groups are 199, 214, 220 and 230, which we refer to as
‘Wyckoff-mismatched’ and in general SBIG (cid:54)= SAIG for them.

While the arguments presented can be simpliﬁed by mak-
ing use of the tables in, say, Ref. [27], we aim to keep the
discussion self-contained below. The only exception to this is
the discussion for 220, in which we make use of the tabulated
properties of the irreps in Refs. [27, 28].

1. The eight remaining space groups with SBIG = SAIG = 8N:

73, 106, 110, 133, 135, 142, 206, and 228

To derive the tight constraints efﬁciently, we note the fol-
lowing: (i) all of the eight space groups have SAIG = 8N [14];
(ii) 142, 206, and 228 contain 73 as a t-subgroup and 133 and
135 contain 106 as a t-subgroup. Here, t-subgroup just means
that vG,G(cid:48) = 1. Hence, all we have to prove is SBIG ⊆ 8N
for 73, 106, and 110, and we have already discussed 73 in the
main text.

This time-reversal pair-switching explains why it is impossi-

reversal pairs at the two ends of the line (π, π, kz), an even
number of U (+)
k must partici-
pate in the band structure and intersect with each other along
this line. This means that 8 branches are the minimum build-
ing block of the band insulator, i.e., SBI

We focus on the line k = (π, π, kz) again. Along this line,
z and GySz generate the order-four group (modulo the lat-
S2
tice translation). They form four 1D reps:
z ) = iξ1e−i kz
2 ,

(S2
(GySz) = iξ2e−i 3kz
(D10)
4 ,
k+(0,0,4π) = D(ξ1,−ξ2)
where ξ1, ξ2 = ±1. Note that U (ξ1,ξ2)
;
namely, when kz increases from 0 to 4π along this line, the
branch with ξ2 = ±1 becomes the one with ξ2 = ∓1. How-
ever, (π, π, 4π) and (π, π, 0) differ only by a reciprocal lat-
tice vector and are hence the same point in the Brillouin zone.
[Remember, (0, 0, 2π) is not a reciprocal lattice vector due
to the body-centered structure]. Therefore, both U (ξ1,ξ2)
and
U (ξ1,−ξ2)
must appear together and intersect with each other
some point along the line k = (π, π, kz).

At k = (π, π, 0), T is a symmetry. Since U (ξ1,ξ2)
k=(π,π,0) and
U (−ξ1,−ξ2)
k=(π,π,0) are complex conjugate with each other, they form
a time-reversal pair and must be degenerate at k = (π, π, 0).
Hence all of the four 1D reps ξ1, ξ2 = ±1 appear precisely
the same number of times along this line.
At k = (π, π, π), T alone is not a symmetry, but the prod-
uct GyT is. Furthermore, (GyT )2 = T 2M 2
y T(0,0,1) = −1
since kz = π and the antiunitary operator GyT thus enforces
a Kramers pairing. To see this more explicitly, let us take the
basis of the 1D representations at k = (π, π, π). It satisﬁes

Writing |ξ1, ξ2(cid:105)(cid:48) ≡ GyT |ξ1, ξ2(cid:105), it can be readily shown that

(D13)
(D14)
|ξ1, ξ2(cid:105)(cid:48) has the same eigenvalues as |ξ1, ξ1ξ2(cid:105).
Namely,
In particular, |+1, +1(cid:105) and GyT |+1, +1(cid:105) transform in the
same representation but they cannot be the same state since
(GyT )2 = −1. Therefore, there must be an even number of
(ξ1, ξ2) = (+1, +1) states. Since all four 1D reps appear the
same number of times, we have proven that 8 bands are the
minimum building blocks, i.e. SBI

110 ⊆ 8N.

2. The four Wyckoff-mismatched space groups:

199, 214, 220, and 230

According to Table I of the main text, SAIG = 4N \ {4} and
SBI
Γ = 4N for 199 and 214. Therefore, we have to determine
if it is possible to realize a ν = 4 BI. In fact, the answer varies
depending on whether the SU(2) symmetry is present or not.
In Ref. [15], we found ν = 4 BI in spin-orbit coupled insula-
tors both for 199 and 214. However, it is not possible to realize
such an insulator without SOC as we discuss now. To show
this, it’s sufﬁcient to discuss only 199, since 214 contains 199
as a t-subgroup.

a. 199

199 (I213) belongs to body-centered cubic system. It has
(i) the three screws as in 73 and (ii) three-fold rotation C3
cyclically permuting (x, y, z), which in total form an order
12 group modulo the lattice translation. As we explained
in Sec. B 3, in the absence of SOC, we can think of the
problem as spinless electrons.
In that case, there are three
1D irreps and one 3D irrep at four points in the BZ k =
(0, 0, 0), (2π, 0, 0), (0, 2π, 0), (0, 0, 2π). All of the three 1D
irreps realize the screw trivially. Namely,

U 1D
k (Si) = +1 for

i = x, y, z.

(D15)

On the other hand, the 3D irrep reads

k (Sx) = diag(+1,−1,−1),
U 3D
k (Sy) = diag(−1, +1,−1),
U 3D
k (Sz) = diag(−1,−1, +1).
U 3D

(D16)
(D17)
(D18)

Now let us consider the line from (0, 0, 0) to (0, 0, 2π). Along
this line Sz remains symmetry and its eigenvalue continuously
changes by the factor of e−ikz/2. In particular, if one uses a
1D rep with Sz = +1 at k = (0, 0, 0), there must be at least
one 3D rep at k = (0, 0, 2π) to account for the Sz = −1
eigenvalue. This argument proves that at least three bands,
each doubly degenerate due to spin, must appear together and
cross with each other for the spinless case. Therefore, for
spinful electrons without SOC, we have proved ν ≥ 6, ex-
cluding the ν = 4 BI.

220

For 220, we know that SBI

b.
220 = 4N \ {4, 8, 20} and
220 ⊇ SAI
also that SBI
24 = 4N as 220 contains 24 as a t-subgroup.
Therefore, all we have to check is if SBI
220 contains 4, 8, and/or
20 or not. The answer again depends on whether the spin
SU(2) symmetry present or not.

220 ⊆ SBI

a. Without SU(2) spin-rotation symmetry As demon-
strated in Ref. [15], there are ﬁlling-enforced quantum band
insulators at ﬁlling ν = 8 and 20. We now prove that it is
impossible to realize a BI at ν = 4.
We start by studying the irreps at k = (2π, 0, 0) ≡ H.
There are two 2D irreps (ΓH
8 ) (See
Table V, which we reproduced based on Ref. [27]). Under TR,
the two 2D irreps are paired to form a 4D co-representation
6 ⊕ ΓH
ΓH
7 , and two copies of the 4D irrep are paired to form a
8D co-representation 2ΓH
8 [24, 27]. For ν = 4, therefore, the
ﬁlled bands must correspond to ΓH
Along the line P-H (k = (1 − κ)P + κH, where P =
(π, π, π)), the little group (modulo lattice translation) is given
by Gk = {(1), (7), (10), (14), (17), (23)}, with (j) denoting
the j-th element as listed in Ref. [14]. In Table V we list the
relevant symmetry characters for the irreps involved. (Note
that all the listed characters are subjected to a ±1 ambiguity
arising from the −1 phase picked up by an electron under a
2π rotation. This ambiguity, however, is ‘global’ in the sense

that one simply picks a convention for each of the elements
in the space group, and the compatibility relations we discuss
are independent of such choice of convention.) Despite each
row represents a different irrep, two rows for a high symmetry
point can look identical due to the restriction to a subgroup of
the little group. Observe that the proposed ν = 4 band insu-
lator must correspond to 2ΓPH
6 along the line P-H, which after
sending κ : 1 → 0 corresponds to 2ΓP

6 at P.

Next we perform a similar analysis along the line N-P
(k = (1 − κ)N + κP with N = (π, π, 0)), for which we have
Gk = {(1), (2), (13), (14)} (Table VI). In particular, observe
that the symmetry character of (2) picks up a phase of θ2 = i
going from P to N (κ : 1 → 0), and therefore the character of
(2) at N is −4i for the proposed ν = 4 band insulator. Since N
is a TRIM, this is contradictory to the assumed TR invariance,
implying 4 (cid:54)∈ SBI
220

b.

In the presence of SU(2) symmetry BIs at ﬁlling ei-
ther ν = 4, 8, or 20 are not allowed in the absence of SOC,
i.e., SBI
220 = 4N \ {4, 8, 20} as we show now. This fol-
lows from what we call ‘the compatibility condition’, which
we have already used many times so far.
In general, sup-
pose that g ∈ G is a symmetry along a high-symmetry line
kκ = (1 − κ)k1 + κk2 connecting two high-symmetry mo-
menta k1 and k2. We denote the eigenvalues of g by ηi(κ)
(i = 1, 2, . . .) at each κ. Then, the number of occurrence of
the eigenvalue ηi(κ) must be a constant along this line be-
cause of the continuity of the band structure. This condition
restricts the allowed combinations of irreps at k1 and k2.
We list in Table VII the number and the dimension of irreps
of Gk at each high-symmetry momentum for spinless elec-
trons with G = 220. For example, there are in total ﬁve ir-
reps at Γ (two 1Ds, one 2D, and two 3Ds). One can ﬁnd the
full list of these irreps in Ref. [28] and we follow the label-
ing there. After imposing the compatibility conditions and the
time-reversal symmetry, we found that there are essentially
three building blocks of band insulators. They are composed
of 6, 8, and 12 branches, respectively labeled by [1], [2] and
[3] below. Here we show the number of occurrence of irreps
at high-symmetry momenta, for each of the three building
blocks:

199 and 214, it is impossible to achieve a BI at ν = 8 without
SOC. This follows from the fact that 8 (cid:54)∈ SBI

Appendix E: Band Insulators on Compact Flat Manifolds

In the main text, we discussed how to put a system of spin-
ful electrons on a compact ﬂat manifold through the example
of 73. Here we expand it with a more general discussion.

These blocks can together form band insulators with ﬁll-
ing ν ∈ {6n1 + 8n2 + 12n3|ni ∈ N} = 2N \ {2, 4, 10}
for spinless electrons symmetric under G = 220 and the
time-reversal T . For spinful electrons with SU(2) spin rota-
tion symmetry, each band is doubly degenerate and therefore
220 = 4N \ {4, 8, 20}.

Since 230 contains 73 as a t-subgroup, we know SBI

SBI
230 = 8N \ {8}, the
73 = 8N. Combining this with SBI
remaining question is if it is possible to isolate 8 bands. Again,
we constructed a tight-biding model that realizes a ν = 8 BI

For a ﬁxed-point free subgroup Γ of G, we can choose ξg
in such a way that ωγ,γ(cid:48) = 1 for all γ, γ(cid:48) ∈ Γ. Namely, Ug is
a linear representation of Γ. Once we have such Ug, one can

(2) An alternative approach is to use the double group
(see Sec. F). In this view, electrons follow a linear repre-
sentation of GF , the ‘doubled’ version of G. An element of
GF is gξ = (ξ, g), where ξ ∈ Z2 and g ∈ G. For ex-
ample, the ‘2π-rotation’, which was identity e ∈ G in the
above projective representation, now corresponds to (−1, e)
ξ(cid:48) ∈ GF is deﬁned as

(ξ, g)(ξ(cid:48), g(cid:48)) = (ω(0)
a nontrivial Z2 extension of G, and ω(0)
g,g(cid:48) encodes the group
structure. For instance, one has (+1, Rx,π)(+1, Rx,π) =
(−1, e) (cid:54)= ((+1)2, R2

two-to-one projection π : GF → G : gξ (cid:55)→ g but there does
not exist a unique map from G → GF . However, in order
to consistently mod-out, we need to specify a homomorphism
 : Γ → ΓF satisfying π ◦  = IdΓ. Here, ΓF is the dou-
bled version of Γ, which is just the corresponding restriction
of GF , i.e., (ξ, γ) (ξ ∈ Z2 and γ ∈ Γ). Once we have such

Let us explain a little more about the meaning of the homo-

morphism . Writing (γ) = (ξ(γ), γ), we have
γ,γ(cid:48)ξ(γ)ξ(γ(cid:48)), γγ(cid:48)),

(γ)(γ(cid:48)) = (ω(0)

T = −1. As long as
where UT is unitary and satisﬁes UT U∗
one deals with Z2-extension, this is always true as G and T
commute.

Equivalently, we require the symmetry g to be compatible
with the chosen homomorphism  involved in modding-out,
i.e. we require g(γ)g−1 ∈ (Γ) for all γ ∈ Γ. In addition,
since the spatial action of ˆ(γ) is trivialized after modding-out,
ˆ(γ) effectively becomes an on-site unitary operator.

3. SBIG for ﬁxed-point free space groups Γ

Here we present an alternative derivation of SBI

Γ by putting
band insulators with G = Γ on the corresponding Bieberbach
manifold.
When Γ is just the translation subgroup 1 ∼ Z3, the com-
pact manifold M = R3/Γ always contains an integer num-
ber of unit cells. However, this is not the case for the other
9 Bieberbach space groups - the number of unit cells on the
manifold M is a integer multiple of the fraction

fΓ ≡ 1

|Γ/T| ,

(E13)

where T is the translation subgroup of Γ. We list |Γ/T| for
each Γ in Table IV.
If the number of unit cells on M is nfΓ, the total number of
electrons on M is NM = νnfΓ. If NM is odd, the single par-
ticle spectrum on M has at least two-fold degeneracy due to
Kramer’s paring. Thus NM must be an even integer in order
to be a unique gapped ground state. Since we can choose n to
be an odd integer that is co-prime with |Γ/T|, ν must be an
integer multiple of 2/fΓ = 2|Γ/T|. By comparing this result
Γ = 2|Γ/T|N for Bieberbach
with SAI
space groups.

Γ in Table III, one gets SBI

Therefore, for  to be a homomorphism, we need

Appendix F: Projective Representation

ξ(γ)ξ(γ(cid:48))

ξ(γγ(cid:48))

ω(0)
γ,γ(cid:48) = 1.

(E10)

Here we brieﬂy review the basics of projective representa-

tions, which appeared many times in this paper.

Comparing with Eq. (E2), one can see that the requirement of
homomorphism is nothing but ωγ,γ(cid:48) = 1 for all γ, γ(cid:48) ∈ Γ in
the previous approach.

1. Deﬁnitions

2. Remnant symmetries

An element g in G but not in Γ may or may not remain a
symmetry on M. The general necessary and sufﬁcient condi-
tion is that
∀γ ∈ Γ,

gγg−1 ∈ Γ and UgUγU−1

g = Ugγg−1.(E11)

For the time reversal symmetry T , one should check

UT U∗

γ U−1T = Uγ,

(E12)

When a set of matrices Ug satisfy UgUg(cid:48) = ωg,g(cid:48)Ugg(cid:48) for all
g, g(cid:48) ∈ G, we call Ug a projective representation of a group
G and ωg,g(cid:48) ∈ A ⊆ U(1) the factor system. To respect the
associative property of matrix product, the factor system must
satisfy the cocycle condition ωg,g(cid:48)ωgg(cid:48),g(cid:48)(cid:48) = ωg,g(cid:48)g(cid:48)(cid:48) ωg(cid:48),g(cid:48)(cid:48).
The factor system ω intrinsically has ambiguity originating
from the redeﬁnition freedom Ug → Ugag (ag ∈ A). ω and ω(cid:48)
are thus said to be equivalent when there exists a map a : G →
A such that ω(cid:48)
agg(cid:48) . Inequivalent factor systems
are fully classiﬁed by H 2(G, A). One can set ωe,g = ωg,e = 1
(e is the identity of G) without loss of generality.

g,g(cid:48) = ωg,g(cid:48) agag(cid:48)

2. Double group

Projective representations are sometimes treated by linear
representations of an enlarged group (the ‘double’ group when
A = Z2). To explicitly see the relation, consider a group
˜G = A×ω G that is a product A×G as a set (so | ˜G| = |A||G|)
but is endowed with the multiplication:
(a, g)(a(cid:48), g(cid:48)) = (ωg,g(cid:48)aa(cid:48), gg(cid:48)), a, a(cid:48) ∈ A, g, g(cid:48) ∈ G.
(F1)
The short exact sequence 1 → A ι−→ ˜G π−→ G → 1, where ι
is the injection a (cid:55)→ (a, e) and π is the projection (a, g) (cid:55)→ g,
deﬁnes a central extension of G by A. Let U be a linear irre-
ducible representation of ˜G [i.e., U(a,g)U(a,g) = U(a,g)(a(cid:48),g(cid:48))]
that satisﬁes U(a,e) = a11. Then a projective irreducible repre-
sentation of G is given by Ug ≡ U(1,g). This is how one can
go back and forth between U and U.

3. Properties of projective irreps

Let us restrict ourself to the case of ﬁnite G and write ir-
reducible representations as U (α) (α = 1, 2, . . . , N; N is the
number of distinct irreps). Then the following useful relations
hold [29, 30]:

N(cid:88)
(cid:88)

dim[U (α)]2 = |G|,

(F4)

Note that 1D representations do not always exist for projective
representations unlike linear (i.e., non projective) representa-
tions for which the trivial representation Ug = 1 is always
valid. 1D representations are allowed only when ωg,g(cid:48) = ωg(cid:48),g
for all g, g(cid:48).
