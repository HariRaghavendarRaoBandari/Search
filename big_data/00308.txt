Abstract

The source of CPT-violation in the photon sector of the Standard Model Extension arises from

a Chern-Simons-like contribution that involves a coupling to a ﬁxed background vector ﬁeld kµ

AF .

These Lorentz- and CPT-violating photons have well-known theoretical issues that arise from miss-

ing states at low momenta when kµ

AF is timelike. In order to make the theory consistent, a tiny

mass for the photon can be introduced, well below current experimental bounds. The implementa-

tion of canonical quantization can then be implemented as in the CPT-preserving case by using the

St¨uckelberg mechanism. We explicitly construct a covariant basis of properly-normalized polariza-

tion vectors at ﬁxed three-momentum satisfying the momentum space ﬁeld equations, in terms of

which the vector ﬁeld can be expanded. As an application of the theory, we calculate the Cherenkov

radiation rate for the case of purely timelike kµ

AF , and ﬁnd a radiation rate at high energies that

has a contribution that does not depend on the mass used to regulate the photons.

INTRODUCTION

The Standard Model Extension (SME) is a framework that incorporates Lorentz- and

CPT-violating eﬀects into the Standard Model [1]. Of particular interest is the pure gauge

sector, where Lorentz violation can be introduced, either while preserving CPT or violating

it. Covariant quantization is extremely useful in performing quantum-ﬁeld-theoretic calcula-

tions as the formulas retain explicit covariance throughout the computational procedure. In

a previous work we discussed how this can be implemented for the CPT-preserving case [2],

where it turned out that a consistent quantization requires the introduction of a mass reg-

ulator. In this work we extend the techniques developed in that work to the CPT-violating

case, which is implemented using a Chern-Simons-like term parametrized by a ﬁxed back-
ground vector kµ

AF [3]. This term has received intensive attention in the literature as it can
arise as a radiative correction from the fermion sector in the presence of an axial vector term

[4]. While quantization of Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory has been addressed before in the
literature [5, 6], attention was restricted to the (massless) case of purely spacelike kµ

AF in
axial gauge. A situation of physical interest is that of vacuum Cherenkov radiation. This has
been studied before, but for the case of spacelike kµ
work on the case of purely timelike kµ

AF [7, 8]. However, there has been recent
AF , in the context of classical Maxwell-Chern-Simons
theory [9]. As an application of the formalism developed in this work we will calculate the

Cherenkov radiation rate in ﬁeld theory at tree level.

An argument could be made that these CPT-violating eﬀects in the photon sector are

irrelevant, because they are bounded observationally to minute levels [3]. We take the point

of view that it is important as a matter of principle to establish whether these eﬀects impede

a rigorous quantization, and if not, in what way the standard procedures have to be modiﬁed.

Also, while CPT-violating eﬀects are strongly bounded in the photon sector, this is not at all

the case in the gluon sector. (Of course we are dealing here with the non-abelian case, but

nevertheless the photon case, if not directly applicable, may oﬀer important lessons there as

well.)

As referred to above, a central element of our construction is the introduction of a nonzero

photon mass. As it turns out, the ultra-tight observational bound on kµ

AF is actually many
orders of magnitude below the bound on the photon mass, making it actually natural to
allow for a nonzero value. In the case of timelike kµ

AF , it is not possible to take the massless

2

limit in a consistent way. For spacelike values, the massless limit is possible. Nevertheless,

even in this case the introduction of a photon mass is a useful way to regulate infrared

divergences that occur in loop diagrams, also in the context of Lorentz-violating eﬀects

[10]. We note that the introduction of a photon mass in the context of the SME has been

studied in the presence of both CPT-preserving and CPT-violating terms at the level of the

equations of motion and the propagator [11].

In section II, we analyze the equations of motions in momentum space, and show that

for the case of timelike kµ

AF the introduction of a nonzero mass parameter avoids a region of
momentum space with imaginary energies. We set up a covariant basis of polarization vectors

that solve the momentum space equations of motions, and satisfy a modiﬁed orthogonality

condition. In section III, an orthogonality relation is derived for the eigenvectors, that is

used to deﬁne a consistent normalization. The ﬁeld operator is then quantized in terms

of creation and annihilation operators in section IV. In section V, we work out the rate of
Cherenkov radiation at tree level for the case of purely timelike kµ

AF . Finally we present our

conclusions.

where kµ

AF is an arbitrary ﬁxed background vector. As is well known [3], for timelike kµ
the dispersion relation following from (1) has a tachyonic character: there is no covariant

AF

separation between positive and negative energy states and there are (low) momenta for

which there are no corresponding real solutions for the energy, signaling an unstable theory

that does not permit a consistent quantization.

As was noted ﬁrst in [13], a way around this problem is to introduce a small mass term

for the photon through the St¨uckelberg mechanism. The photon Lagrangian becomes

where e(λ)

β (~p) are the eigenvectors, which we will take to be a function of the spacelike three

γ)(cid:2)(p2 − m2

γ)2 + 4(cid:0)k2

AF p2 − (kAF · p)2(cid:1)(cid:3) = 0 .

(4)

We see that there is an unphysical, gauge-dependent mode satisfying the dispersion relation

p2 = ξm2
denote by e(0) and e(3), respectively. They can be constructed from pµ and kµ

γ and a physical mode with the conventional dispersion relation which we will
AF subspace.

For mγ > 0, it is straightforward to check that

e(0) µ(~p) = N0pµ,

where N0 and N3 are normalization constants. We see that e(0) is always timelike, while e(3)

is generally spacelike.

The two remaining, physical modes (denoted by e(+) and e(−)) which satisfy the perturbed

dispersion relation are spacelike and generally exhibit birefringent behavior.

In this work we will assume that kµ

AF is timelike. We can then always choose an observer

frame in which ~kAF = 0, k0

AF > 0. The perturbed energies become

we will assume this to be the case. An explicit expression for the modes e(±) is given by

where N± are normalization constants. Note that this expression is indeterminate when

~p = p2ˆe2, in which case an alternative expression can be easily found.

It is interesting to compare the current experimental bounds on these parameters. The

mass of the photon can be bounded through examination of large-scale magnetic ﬁelds which

4

would be have a perturbed structure if the photon had a signiﬁcant mass. The particle data

group quotes

mγ < 1 × 10−27 GeV.

(9)

It may be possible to improve on this bound by nine orders of magnitude or so by verifying

certain properties of galactic magnetic ﬁelds, but this result is still many orders of magnitude

from the best bounds on kAF

(10)

from cosmological searches for birefringence [3]. This implies that if one wants to construct

a phenomenologically viable model for photons with CPT-violation, it is possible to assume

a nonzero mass that would be entirely consistent with experimental observations.

It is easy to see from (6) that one of the perturbed dispersion relations implies spacelike

four-momenta, while the other involves superluminal propagation, for suﬃciently large values

of |~p |. This fact is well known in the literature [14].

III. ORTHOGONALITY OF THE EIGENVECTORS

One implication of (3) is found by dotting with pµ, which yields the condition

(p2 − ξm2

γ)(e(λ) · p) = 0 ,

(11)

indicating that the physical states λ = +, −, 3 for which p2 6= ξm2

γ must be transverse to

momentum.

An orthogonality relation can be derived writing the equation of motion in the form

ventional Gupta-Bleuler method. From these deﬁnitions we ﬁnd the commutation relations:

0 (1 − ξ)) δ3(~x − ~y) ,

Application of this algebra of mode operators to the coordinate-space commutation relations

(18), (19), and (20) for the vector potential imply a variety of identities for bilinears of the

Note that the right-hand side is independent of momentum indicating that a complete set

of polarization vectors must exist for every momentum choice. Unfortunately, this is not

always true in the massless limit, so the presence of a mass term is crucial for the consistency

of the quantization procedure.

V. VACUUM CHERENKOV RADIATION

It is well known that the deformed dispersion relations in the Maxwell-Chern-Simons

theory can give rise to vacuum Cherenkov radiation. This has been worked out in detail

7

in particular for the case of spacelike kµ

AF , both by analyzing the classical equations of
motion [7] as well as in the context of quantum ﬁeld theory [8]. The purely timelike case

was considered very recently on the level of the classical equations of motion [9], with the

conclusion that the radiation rate is exactly zero.

We will use the formalism developed above to analyse this case in the context of quantum

ﬁeld theory. The relevant process is

e− → e− + γ .

(28)

We will consider this process at tree level, represented by the Feynman diagram

q

p

q′ = q − p

which we will analyze in the context of electrodynamics. We assume for the lagrangian

L = LA + Lf

with the standard Dirac fermion lagrangian

which we assume to be without any Lorentz violation.

Lf =Z d4x ¯ψ(i/∂ − ie /A + m)ψ

(29)

(30)

Cherenkov radiation is possible if there is a range of three-momenta for which the fermion

group velocity exceeds the photon phase velocity. This in turn implies that the latter should

be subluminal, that is, the photon four-momentum should be spacelike. This can only

happen for the e(−) mode, for suﬃciently large three-momenta, as we can see from (6) and

(7).

Here we have averaged over the initial, and summed over the ﬁnal fermion spin states. The

fermion phase space factors in (31) are conventional, while the photon energy p0 is, of course,

in accordance with the modiﬁed dispersion relation (6) corresponding to the e(−) mode.

The limits pmax,min in the integral over |~p| arise because the integral over θ in the second

identity of (38) requires that the delta-function representing energy conservation be satisﬁed

for some value of θ.

Note also that the square root in the second term of (39) imposes that its argument be

non-negative. This implies that

(40)

(41)

As typically m ≫ mγ > k0

AF , the right-hand side of (41) will be negative. Therefore we
will ignore the possibility that ~q satisﬁes condition (41). We conclude that there is only a

nonzero radiation rate if the momentum of the incoming fermion exceeds the minimum value

qmin. For smaller momenta, the radiation rate is exactly zero. A particularly interesting fact
is the sensitive dependence of the threshold momentum on the ratio mγ/k0
if this ratio is one, the threshold momentum is only of order k0

AF . For example,

The integral over |~p| in (38) can be evaluated exactly with the use of Mathematica. While

FIG. 2. Cherenkov radiation rate for purely timelike kAF for small values of the fermion momentum.

In Figs. 1 and 2 the radiation rate is plotted for particular values of the parameters. The

two regimes identiﬁed in (42) and (43) are clearly visible in Fig. 1. It is interesting that

the (quadratic and linear) dependences on |~q| in these regimes have analogues in the case
of spacelike kµ

AF [7, 8]. In addition, for the case mγ/k0

AF ∼ 1, the very low-energy radiation

rate is proportional to (k0

AF )2 and is most likely unobservable.

Our work begins with the introduction of a nonzero mass which insures well-deﬁned

real energies, and, as we have shown, results in an observable physical eﬀect: the rate of

11

Cherenkov radiation for purely timelike kµ

AF is nonzero. The literature includes attempts
to treat the case of a massless photon and the associated diﬃculties involving imaginary

energies [9]. In particular, the predictions involving the rate of Cherenkov radiation diﬀer

from the nonzero mass case.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have shown that a rigorous covariant quantization of CPT-violating electrodynamics

can be carried out for both timelike and spacelike Lorentz-violating parameter kµ

AF . In the
former case it is necessary to introduce a photon mass to avoid imaginary energies for small

three momentum. Our construction deﬁnes, at every value of three-momentum, a basis of

polarization vectors satisfying a modiﬁed orthogonality relation. The gauge potential can

then be expanded consistently in terms of creation and annihilation operators satisfying the

usual commutation relations.

We calculated the Cherenkov radiation rate in ﬁeld theory at tree level, obtaining an

explicit expression for the rate. The dependence of the rate on the fermion momentum is
reminiscent of similar dependences encountered in the case of spacelike kµ

AF . A new, sensitive

dependence of the threshold for radiation production on the ratio of the photon mass to k0

AF

is also found.

In this work we only considered the CPT-violating kAF parameter of the minimal

SME. Recently, a generalization of this parameter has been introduced involving higher-

dimensional operators [15]. It would be interesting to investigate vacuum Cherenkov radia-

tion in this context.
