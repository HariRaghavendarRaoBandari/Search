ON SOME SPECIAL FAMILIES OF q-HYPERGEOMETRIC MAASS

FORMS

KATHRIN BRINGMANN, JEREMY LOVEJOY, AND LARRY ROLEN

Abstract. Using special polynomials introduced by Hikami and the second author in their
study of torus knots, we construct classes of q-hypergeometric series lying in the Habiro ring.
These give rise to new families of quantum modular forms, and their Fourier coeﬃcients en-
code distinguished Maass cusp forms. The cuspidality of these Maass waveforms is proven
by making use of the Habiro ring representations of the associated quantum modular forms.
Thus, we provide an example of using the q-hypergeometric structure of associated series
to establish modularity properties which are otherwise non-obvious. We conclude the paper
with a number of motivating questions and possible connections with Hecke characters, com-
binatorics, and still mysterious relations between q-hypergeometric series and the passage
from positive to negative coeﬃcients of Maass waveforms.

1. Introduction and Statement of Results

To motivate our results, we begin by discussing the role played by certain polynomials
Hn(k, ℓ; b; q), deﬁned explicitly in (2.1). These polynomials also appeared in recent work of
Hikami and the second author [7], where the special case b = 1 was related to torus knots and
quantum modular forms. Speciﬁcally, the n-th coeﬃcient in Habiro’s cyclotomic expansion
of the colored Jones polynomial of the left-handed torus knot T (2, 2k + 1) was shown to
be qn+1−kHn+1(k, 1; 1; q), and the general Hn(k, ℓ; 1; q) were used to construct a class of q-
hypergeometric series with interesting behavior both at roots of unity and inside the unit
circle. As we shall see shortly, this is the heart of the quantum modular phenomenon; the
reader is also referred to [7] for more details.

In this paper, we consider classes of q-hypergeometric Maass cusp forms constructed from
the polynomials Hn(k, ℓ; b; q). These functions, denoted by Fj(k, ℓ; q) (j ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}), are
deﬁned in (2.2), and contain two celebrated q-series of Andrews, Dyson, and Hickerson [4]
as special cases. Namely, we have

(1.1)

and

(1.2)

F4(1, 1; q) = −σ∗(−q),

are the original deﬁnitions of Andrews, Dyson, and Hickerson, while the second equalities
were established by Cohen [6]. The function σ was ﬁrst considered in Ramanujan’s “Lost”
notebook (see [2]). Andrews, Dyson, and Hickerson showed [4] that this series satisﬁes

then lim sup|S(n)| = ∞ but S(n) = 0 for inﬁnitely many n. Their proof is closely related
to indeﬁnite theta series representations of σ, such as:

σ(q) = Xn≥0

|ν|≤n

(−1)n+νq

−ν2(cid:0)1 − q2n+1(cid:1) .

The coeﬃcients of σ∗(q) have the same properties.

Subsequently Cohen [6] showed how to nicely package the q-series of Andrews, Dyson, and
Hickerson within a single modular object. Namely, he proved that if coeﬃcients {T (n)}n∈1+24Z
are deﬁned by

qσ(cid:0)q24(cid:1) =:Xn≥0

T (n)qn,

q−1σ∗(cid:0)q24(cid:1) =:Xn<0

T (n)q−n,

then the T (n) are the Fourier coeﬃcients of a Maass waveform. The deﬁnitions of Maass
waveforms and the details of this construction are reviewed in Section 2.3. In this paper,
we show that the functions Fj(k, ℓ; q) have a similar connection to Maass waveforms, and
by (1.1) and (1.2) may thus be considered as a q-hypergeometric framework containing the
examples of Andrews, Dyson, and Hickerson and Cohen.

In what follows, we let f be a Maass waveform with eigenvalue 1/4 (under the hyperbolic
Laplacian ∆) on a congruence subgroup (and with a possible multiplier), which is cuspidal
at i∞. If the Fourier expansion of f is given, as in Lemma 2.3, by (τ = u + iv)

We remark in passing that such a map from Maass forms to q-series was studied extensively
by Lewis and Zagier [10, 11], and, as we shall see, was used by Zagier [15] to show that such
functions are quantum modular forms.

for some α ∈ Q, where d = 1 if j ∈ {1, 3} and d = 2 if j ∈ {2, 4} .
Remark. The cuspidality of the Maass waveform Gj,k,ℓ is far from obvious.
Indeed, the
authors are aware of only two approaches to prove such a result: either to explicitly write
down representations for the Gj,k,ℓ in terms of Hecke characters (which we suspect exist,
but which we were computationally unable to identify), or, as we show below, to use the
q-hypergeometric representations of the Fj directly. This connection, which was hinted at
for certain examples in [12], utilizes q-hypergeometric series to deduce modularity properties
in an essential way.

The proof of Theorem 1.1 relies on the Bailey pair machinery and important results of
Zwegers [16] giving modular completions for indeﬁnite theta functions of a general shape.
In particular, this family of indeﬁnite theta functions naturally describes the behavior of
functions studied by many others in the literature, as described in a recent proof of Krauel,
Woodbury, and the second author [9] of unifying conjectures of Li, Ngo, and Rhoades [12].
The indeﬁnite theta functions considered here are given for M ∈ N≥2 and vectors a =:
(a1, a2) ∈ Q2 and b =: (b1, b2) ∈ Q2 such that a1 ± a2 6∈ Z:

Theorem 1.1. For any k, ℓ ∈ N, with 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ k, and j ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}, there exists a Maass
cusp form Gj,k,ℓ with eigenvalue 1/4 for some congruence subgroup of SL2(Z), such that

 Xn±ν≥−⌊a1±a2⌋

+ Xn±ν<−⌊a1±a2⌋

 e ((M + 1)b1n − (M − 1)b2ν) q

The next theorem states conditions under which Sa,b;M is the image of a Maass waveform
under the map deﬁned in (1.6). The deﬁnitions of γM , the equivalence relation ∼, and the
operation ∗ are given in Section 2.4.
Theorem 1.2. Suppose that a, b ∈ Q2 with a 6= 0, a1± a2 6∈ Z, M ∈ N≥2, and (γM a, γM b) ∼
(a, b) or both (γM a, γM b) ∼ (a∗, b∗) and (γM a∗, γM b∗) ∼ (a, b) hold. Then Sa,b;M = F + for a
Maass waveform F of eigenvalue 1/4 on a congruence subgroup of SL2(Z).

Remark. The family of q-series Fj in Theorem 1.1 are all specializations of the series Sa,b;M .
We note that although all of the functions Fj are cusp forms, for a general Maass form F in
Theorem 1.2 this is not always true. For example, the function W1 considered in Theorem
2.1 of [12] is shown not to be a cusp form, and using Theorem 4.2 and (4.4) one can easily
check that the function W1 ﬁts into the family Sa,b;M .

In addition to the relations of the q-series Fj to Maass forms, following Zagier’s work,
we ﬁnd that these functions are instances of so-called quantum modular forms [15]. These
new types of modular objects, which are reviewed in Section 2.5, are connected to many
important combinatorial generating functions, knot and 3-manifold invariants, and are in-
timately tied to the important volume conjecture for hyperbolic knots. Roughly speaking,
a quantum modular form is a function which is deﬁned on a subset of Q and which fails

4

KATHRIN BRINGMANN, JEREMY LOVEJOY, AND LARRY ROLEN

to transform modular by a particularly “nice” function. Viewed from a general modularity
framework, the generating function of the set of positive coeﬃcients of a Maass form au-
tomatically has quantum modular transformations when considered as (possibly divergent)
asymptotic expansions. The situation becomes much nicer when, as happens for σ and σ∗,
q-hypergeometric representations can be furnished which show convergence at various roots
of unity (as the series specialize to ﬁnite sums of roots of unity). This quantum modularity
result, as well as the relation of the associated quantum modular forms to the cuspidality of
the Maass form is described in Theorem 2.8. In particular, if such a q-series is an element
of the Habiro ring, which essentially means that it can be written as

an(q)(q)n

Xn≥0

for polynomials an(q) ∈ Z[q], then it is apparent that it converges at all roots of unity q,
and hence the associated Maass form is cuspidal. This observation, combined with Zagier’s
ideas, yields the following corollary (the deﬁnitions of quantum modular forms and related
terms are given in Section 2.5).

Theorem 1.3. For any choice of j, k, ℓ as in Theorem 1.1, the functions Fj,k,ℓ are quantum
modular forms of weight 1 on a congruence subgroup with quantum set P1(Q). Moreover, the
cocycles rγ, deﬁned in (2.7), are real-analytic on R \ {γ−1i∞}.

The paper is organized as follows.

In Section 2, we recall the basic preliminaries and
deﬁnitions needed for the proofs and explicit formulations of the main theorems, which are
then proven in Section 3. As mentioned above, the main tools are the Bailey pair method,
work of Zwegers in [16], and ideas from Zagier’s seminal paper on quantum modular forms
[15]. We conclude in Section 4 with further commentary on related questions and possible
future work.

2. Preliminaries

2.1. Deﬁnitions of the H polynomials and the q-hypergeometric series Fj. We
begin by introducing the polynomials Hn. To do so, we require the Gaussian polynomials,
given by

(cid:20)n
k(cid:21)q

:=( (q)n

(q)n−k(q)k
0

if n ∈ N0 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n,
otherwise.

For k ∈ N, 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ k, and b ∈ {0, 1}, we deﬁne the polynomials Hn(k, ℓ; b; q) by
(2.1)

Hn(k, ℓ; b; q) :=

Xn=nk≥nk−1≥···≥n1≥0

Here we have used the usual charactersitic function χA, deﬁned to be 1 if A is true and 0
otherwise.

For 1 ≤ j ≤ 4, the functions Fj(k, ℓ; q) are then given by 1

Note that when k = 1 the polynomials in (2.1) are identically 1, so (1.1) and (1.2) follow
from (1.3) and (1.4).

2.2. Bailey pairs. In this subsection, we brieﬂy recall the Bailey pair machinery, which is
a powerful tool for connecting q-hypergeometric series with series such as indeﬁnite theta
functions. The basic input of this method is a Bailey pair relative to a, which is a pair of
sequences (αn, βn)n≥0 satisfying

βn =

nXk=0

αk

(q)n−k(aq)n+k

.

Bailey’s lemma then provides a framework for proving many q-series identities. For our
purposes, we need only a limiting form, which says that if (αn, βn) is a Bailey pair relative
to a, then we have the identity

For more on Bailey pairs and Bailey’s lemma, see [1, 3, 14].

We record four special cases of (2.3) for later use.

2.3. Maass waveforms and Cohen’s example. We now recall the basic deﬁnitions and
facts from the theory of Maass waveforms. The interested reader is also referred to [5, 8] for
more details. Maass waveforms, or simply Maass forms, are functions on H which transform
like modular functions but instead of being meromorphic are eigenfunctions of the hyperbolic
Laplacian. For τ = u + iv ∈ H (with u, v ∈ R), this operator is deﬁned by

We also require the fact that any translation invariant function f , namely a function satis-
fying f (τ + 1) = f (τ ), has a Fourier expansion at inﬁnity of the form

(2.6)

(2.7)

where

∆ := −v2(cid:18) ∂2

∂v2(cid:19) .

f (τ ) =Xn∈Z
af (v; n) :=Z 1

0

af (v; n)e(nu),

f (t + iv)e(−nt)dt.

Similarly, such an f has Fourier expansions at any cusp a of Γ, whose coeﬃcients we denote
by af,a(v; n).
Deﬁnition 2.2. Let Γ ⊆ SL2(Z) be a congruence subgroup. A Maass waveform f on Γ with
eigenvalue λ = s(1 − s) ∈ C is a smooth function f : H → C satisfying
(i) f (γτ ) = f (τ ) for all γ ∈ Γ;
(ii) f grows at most polynomially at the cusps;
(iii) ∆ (f ) = λf .
If, moreover, af,a(0; 0) = 0 for each cusp a of Γ, then f is a Maass cusp form.

We also require the general shape of Fourier expansions of such Maass forms. As all of our
forms are cusp forms, the following is suﬃcient for our purposes. The proof may be found in
any standard text on Maass forms (such as those listed above), but we note that it follows
from the diﬀerential equation (iii), growth condition (ii), and the translation property of f .
Lemma 2.3. Let f be a Maass cusp form with eigenvalue λ = s(1 − s). Then there exist
κ1, κ2, af (n) ∈ C, n 6= 0, such that

f (τ ) = κ1vs + κ2v1−sδs(v) + v

where Kν is the K-Bessel function, and δs(v) is equal to log(v) or 1, depending on whether
s = 1/2 or s 6= 1/2, respectively. Such an expansion also exists at all cusps.

Cohen proved (using the notation of (1.5)) that the function

is a Maass form on the congruence subgroup Γ0(2) with a multiplier. Namely, u satisﬁes the
transformations

f (τ ) := v

and is an eigenfunction of ∆ with eigenvalue 1/4. Put another way, Cohen showed that

f +(τ ) = σ(q),

(in the notation of (1.6)) and that σ∗ similarly interprets the negative Fourier coeﬃcients of
u. Cohen’s proof relies on connections between σ, σ∗ and the arithmetic of a quadratic ﬁeld,
which also forms the basis of investigations by many authors of the series discussed by Li,
Ngo, and Rhoades in [12]. However, as noted above, computing the Hecke characters related
to such q-series using Cohen’s methods quickly becomes computationally diﬃcult. Instead,
we use work of Zwegers which provides a convenient framework for giving examples of Maass
forms and allows us to circumvent these problems.

2.4. Work of Zwegers and related notation. In this section we summarize the important
recent work of Zwegers [16], which allows us to study the relation between indeﬁnite theta
functions and Maass forms. Eﬀectively, Zwegers showed for a large class of indeﬁnite theta
functions how to deﬁne eigenfunctions of ∆, along with special completion terms which
correct their (non)-modularity. What is especially useful in our case, is the theory which
Zwegers provides for studying when these completion terms vanish. To describe the setup,
suppose that A is a symmetric 2× 2 matrix with integral coeﬃcients such that the quadratic
form Q deﬁned by Q(r) := 1
2rT Ar is indeﬁnite of signature (1, 1), where rT denotes the
transpose of r. Let B(r, µ) be the associated bilinear form given by
B(r, µ) := rT Aµ = Q(r + µ) − Q(r) − Q(µ),

and take vectors c1, c2 ∈ R2 with Q(cj) = −1 and B(c1, c2) < 0. In other words, we are
assuming that c1 and c2 belong to the same one of the two components of the space of vectors
c satisfying Q(c) = −1. We denote this choice of component by

CQ := {x ∈ R2 | Q(x) = −1, B(x, c1) < 0}.

It is easily seen that Q splits over R as a product of linear factors Q(r) = Q0(P r) for some
(non-unique) P ∈ GL2(R), where Q0(r) := r1r2 with r =: (r1, r2). Note that P satisﬁes
A = P T ( 0 1
1 0 )P . The choice of P is not unique, however we ﬁx a P with sign chosen so that

P −1(cid:0) 1

−1(cid:1) ∈ CQ. Then, for each c ∈ CQ, there is a unique t ∈ R such that

(2.8)

c = c(t) := P −1(cid:18) et

−e−t (cid:19) .

8

KATHRIN BRINGMANN, JEREMY LOVEJOY, AND LARRY ROLEN

Additionally, for c ∈ CQ we let c⊥ = c⊥(t) := P −1(cid:0) et

Q(c⊥) = 1. It is easily seen that these two conditions determine c⊥ up to sign.

e−t(cid:1). Note that B(c, c⊥) = 0, and

Note in particular that

Here we used that in the proof of convergence in [16] it is shown that for the ﬁrst sum in
the deﬁnition of Φa,b, Q is positive deﬁnite whereas in the second sum Q is negative deﬁnite
from. Given convergence of this series, it is immediate from the diﬀerential equation satisﬁed
by K0 that Φa,b is an eigenfunction of the Laplace operator ∆ with eigenvalue 1/4.

Zwegers then found a completion of Φa,b. Moreover, he gave useful conditions to determine
when the extra completion term vanishes. To describe this, we ﬁrst consider for c ∈ CQ the
q-series

Theorem 2.5. The function Φa,b converges absolutely for any choice of parameters a, b, and

Q such that Q is non-zero on a + Z2. Moreover, the function bΦa,b converges absolutely and

can be decomposed as

Moreover, it satisﬁes the elliptic transformations

where A∗ := (A11, . . . , Arr)T.

These results can be conveniently repackaged in the language of Theorem 1.2 as follows.
We note that the addition of the transformation results involving (a∗, b∗) is based on the
discussion of the proof of (14) in [16].
Proposition 2.6. If a, b are chosen so that (γa, γb) ∼ (a, b) for some γ ∈ Aut+(Q, Z) with
γc1 = c2, then

In particular, it is a Maass form (with a multiplier) on a congruence subgroup.

The connection of the series Sa,b;M with Maass forms (once these series are decorated with
the proper K-Bessel functions) follows from Zwegers’ work, given certain special conditions.
To describe these, we deﬁne an equivalence relation on the set of pairs (a, b). We also set

a,b = Φc1,c2

which is useful for our purposes as it lies in Aut+(Q, Z) and satisﬁes γM c = c′. For future
reference, we also deﬁne the equivalence relation

if a ± α ∈ Z2 and b ± β =: µ ∈ Z2 with B(a, µ) ∈ Z (note that the two ± are required to
have the same sign). Finally, for a generic vector x = (x1, x2), we let

(a, b) ∼ (α, β)

x∗ := (−x1, x2).

2.5. Quantum modular forms and the map F 7→ F +. In this section, we review Lewis
and Zagier’s construction [11] of period functions for Maass waveforms, and following Zagier
[15] indicate how so-called quantum modular forms may be formed using them. We also
use this construction in the proof of Theorem 1.1, as we shall see that the q-hypergeometric
forms of the associated quantum modular forms are essential for showing cuspidality of the
Maass waveforms.

We begin by recalling the deﬁnition of quantum modular forms (see [15] for a general

survey).
Deﬁnition 2.7. For any subset X ⊆ P1(Q), a function f : X → C is a quantum modular
form with quantum set X of weight k ∈ 1
Z on a congruence subgroup Γ if for all γ ∈ Γ, the
cocycle (|k the usual slash operator)

2

rγ(x) := f|k(1 − γ)(x)

extends to an open subset of R and is analytically “nice”. Here “nice” could mean continu-
ous, smooth, real-analytic etc.

This deﬁnition is intentionally open-ended to allow the theory to branch out in many
diﬀerent directions. In general, one knows one is dealing with a quantum modular form if it
has a certain feeling, which Zagier brilliantly explained in his several motivating examples.
The ﬁrst main example he gave, and the one most relevant for us here, is that of quantum
modular forms attached to the positive (and negative) coeﬃcients of Maass forms. Although
Zagier only worked out this example explicitly in one case, and the work of Lewis and Zagier
only studied Maass cusp forms of level one, for our purposes it is important to consider a
more general situation. This is described in the following result, which extends observations
of Lewis and Zagier for Maass Eisenstein series of Li, Ngo, and Rhoades for special examples
in [12], and where, for a Maass form F on a congruence subgroup Γ, we set

ΓF := Γ ∩(cid:8)γ ∈ Γ : F is cuspidal at γ−1i∞(cid:9) .

Theorem 2.8. Let F be a Maass waveform on a congruence subgroup Γ with eigenvalue 1/4
under ∆ which is cuspidal at i∞. Then F + deﬁnes a quantum modular form of weight one
on a subset X ⊆ P1(Q) on ΓF . Moreover, F is cuspidal exactly at those cusps which lie in
the maximal such set X.

Remarks.
(1) The quantum modular form deﬁned by F + may formally be given on all of P1(Q). This
is done by considering asymptotic expansions of F + near the cusps, instead of simply
values. This consideration leads to Zagier’s notion of a strong quantum modular form.

(2) There is also a quantum modular form associated to the negative coeﬃcients of F , which
is also a part of the object corresponding to F under the Lewis-Zagier correspondence
of [11].

Sketch of proof of Theorem 2.8. The key idea, already present in [11], is to realize F + as
an integral transform of F deﬁned in (1.6). To describe this, we require the real-analytic

function Rτ given by (z = x + iy with x, y ∈ R)

Rτ (z) :=

p(x − τ )2 + y2

This function is an eigenfunction of ∆ with eigenvalue 1/4. For two real-analytic functions
f, g deﬁned on H, we also consider their Green’s form

Then Lewis and Zagier showed (see also Proposition 3.5 of [12] for a direct statement and

a detailed proof) that

F +(τ ) = −

2

πZ i∞

[F (z), Rτ (z)] .

This formula, which may also be thought of as an Abel transform, can also be rephrased as
in the proposition of Chapter II, Section 2 of [11] in the following convenient form:

(2.11)

F +(τ ) = CZ i∞

dz! ,

where C is a constant. Now for general functions f, g which are eigenfunctions of ∆ with
eigenvalue 1/4, the quantity [f, g] is actually a closed one-form. This fact, combined with
the modularity transformations of F and the equivariance property

Rγτ (γz) = (cτ + d)Rτ (z)

for γ = ( a b

c d ) ∈ SL2(R) directly shows (as in (14) of [15]) that

F +(τ ) − (cτ + d)−1F +(γτ ) = −Z i∞

γ−1i∞

[F (z), Rτ (z)]

for all γ ∈ ΓF . This last integral converges since, by assumption, F is cuspidal at γ−1i∞.
As the integral on the right hand side of the last formula is real-analytic on R \ {γ−1i∞},
this establishes the ﬁrst claim, if we note that the values of the quantum modular form, if
they converge, are given as the limits towards rational points from above. That is, the value
of the quantum modular form at α ∈ Q equals
F +(α) := lim
(2.12)
t→0+

F +(α + it).

We next establish the second claim, which states that (2.12) exists precisely for those α
for which F is cuspidal. By the existence of a Fourier expansion at all cusps in Lemma 2.3,
and using the exponential decay of K0(x) as x → ∞, we ﬁnd that, for t > 0,
(2.13)

where γ = ( a b
c d ) ∈ SL2(Z) is chosen such that γα = i∞ and we write f (t) ≈ g(t) if f − g
decays faster than any polynomial in t, as t → 0+. We have also used the fact that cα+d = 0
to note that the imaginary part of γ(α + it) is t/|cα + cit + d|2 = 1/(c2t). Our goal is to
show that (2.12) converges if and only if κ1 = κ2 = 0.

For this, we also require an estimate on ∂F

∂z (α + it). To compute this, we note that

F is cuspidal.

3. Proofs of the main results

(cid:3)

3.1. Proof of Theorem 1.2. For any M ∈ N≥2, consider the quadratic form Q(x, y) :=
ℓ ∈ {1, 2} the vectors

2 ((M + 1)x2 − (M − 1)y2)) associated to the symmetric matrix A := (cid:0) M +1

1−M(cid:1) and for

0

0

cℓ :=

1

√M 2 − 1(cid:0)(−1)ℓ(M − 1), M + 1(cid:1)T

.

It is easily checked that Q(cℓ) = −1 and B(c1, c2) = −2M < 0, so that these two vectors lie
in the same component CQ. Choose a = (a1, a2) ∈ Q2 and b = (b1, b2) ∈ Q2. Then, for any
vector r = (n, ν)T, we ﬁnd that

and thus

B(r, c1)B(r, c2) = (M 2 − 1)(ν − n)(ν + n),

ρA(a + r) =

1
2

(1 + sgn((a1 − a2 − ν + n)(a1 + a2 + ν + n))) .

A SPECIAL FAMILY OF MAASS FORMS

13

Given these choices, we ﬁnd that the family of indeﬁnite theta functions Sa,b;M may be
understood in Zwegers’ notation via the relation

Φ+
a,b = sgn(t2 − t1)e ((M + 1)a1b1 − (M − 1)a2b2) Sa,b;M .

Since γM , deﬁned in (2.10), can easily be veriﬁed to lie in Aut+(Q, Z) and γM c1 = c2, the
theorem then follows from Proposition 2.6 if (γM a, γM b) ∼ (a, b). We next prove the theorem
if (γM a, γM b) ∼ (a∗, b∗) and (γM a∗, γM b∗) ∼ (a, b). The key step is to show that the involution
a,b . For this, we compute a parameterization c(t) of CQ. We ﬁnd

(a, b) 7→ (a∗, b∗) ﬁxes bΦc,c′
√M +1 −√M−1(cid:17) . Then we obtain that c(t) =
that a suitable choice for P is given by P = 1√2(cid:16) √M +1 √M−1
(cid:18) √ 2
M −1 cosh(t)(cid:19) . In this parameterization, we have tℓ = (−1)ℓ+1 arcsinh(−p(M − 1)/2) for
bΦc1,c2
a∗,b∗ =bΦc1,c2

√ 2
ℓ ∈ {1, 2}, and c(−t) = c∗(t). Hence, by sending x 7→ −x and r 7→ r∗ in (2.9), we ﬁnd that

. We then obtain, using Lemma 2.4, that

which shows that the completion terms in Φc1,c2
cancel out, as desired. Finally, we note that
a,b
since M ∈ N≥2, Q(x, y) cannot vanish at rational values x, y unless x = y = 0 since M − 1
and M + 1 are coprime and cannot both be squares. As we have supposed that a ∈ Q2 \{0},
it automatically follows that the quadratic form above cannot vanish on a + Z2, and hence
our choice satisﬁes the convergence requirement in Theorem 2.5.

3.2. Proof of Theorem 1.1. We begin by showing the connection of the relevant q-series
to indeﬁnite theta functions. To do so, we use the Bailey pairs in the following lemma. These
pairs have the rare and important feature that the βn are polynomials.
Lemma 3.1. Let k, ℓ ∈ N with 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ k. We have the Bailey pair relative to 1,

Proof. The Bailey pair relative to 1 was established in [7, Section 5]. The proof of the Bailey
pair relative to q follows by using a similar argument. We begin by replacing K by k and ℓ
by k − ℓ in part (i) of Theorem 1.1 of [13]. This gives that (αn, βn) is a Bailey pair relative
to q, where αn is given in (3.3) and

recall a consequence of the q-binomial theorem,

Continuing in the same manner, replacing mk+ν by mk−ν + nν and evaluating the sum on

the nν’s, and the result is

(2.4) and (2.5), while the second two use (3.3) and (3.4) in equations (2.6) and (2.7).
(cid:3)

We are now ready to prove our main result.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. We ﬁrst apply Theorem 1.2 to the indeﬁnite theta function represen-
tations of the Fν, given in Proposition 3.2. We begin with F1. Using the term (1 − q2n+1) to

split the right-hand side into two sums and then replacing n by −n − 1 in the second sum,
we obtain

We claim that the right-hand side is equal to Sa,b;M deﬁned in (1.7) with M = 2k + 2, a =
( 2k+1
2(2k+3) , 2k−2ℓ+1
2(2k+1) )T. The summand is directly seen to match that
of (1.7). To show that the summation bounds are correct, we use the restrictions on k and ℓ
to verify the inequalities 0 < a1 ± a2 < 1. For example, to see this for a1 − a2, we note that

2(2k+3) ,

1

1

a1 − a2 =

(2k + 3)ℓ − 2k − 1
(2k + 3)(2k + 1)

is positive exactly if ℓ > (2k + 1)/(2k + 3). As 0 < (2k + 1)/(2k + 3) < 1 and ℓ ≥ 1, this
inequality automatically holds. To check the upper bound, note that a1 − a2 < 1 exactly
if ℓ < 2(k+2)(2k+1)
. This last expression is always bigger than k, and ℓ is, by assumption,
bounded by k, so this inequality holds. The inequalities on a1 + a2 may be checked in a
similar manner. We then show that

and γM b∗ = b

and also that B(a, (−1,−1)T) = −ℓ ∈ Z Theorem 1.2 yields the ﬁrst claim in Theorem
1.1 for F1, namely that it is the generating function for the positive coeﬃcients of a Maass
waveform. We return to the question of cuspidality of this Maass form below, after indicating
the related calculations which must be performed on the other Fj.

In the case of F2, we ﬁnd in the same manner that F2(k, ℓ; q2) is equal (up to a rational
4(2k+1) )T.

establishes the theorem for F2.

1(cid:19) = a,

γM b∗ = b,

γM b −(cid:18)1

1(cid:19) = b∗,

and B(a, (−1,−1)T) = 2k − 2ℓ + 1.
Thus, we have shown that the q-series in Theorem 1.1 are indeed the positive parts of
Maass forms. By the construction of Zwegers’ Maass forms via the Fourier expansions in
(2.4), we see that the Maass forms here are all cuspidal at i∞ whenever they converge.
Theorems 2.8 and 1.3 then imply that in fact each of the Maass forms in Theorem 1.1 are
indeed cusp forms.

3.3. Proof of Theorem 1.3. Theorem 1.3 follows directly from Theorem 1.1 and Theorem
2.8, together with the observation that the q-series in (2.2) converge (as they are ﬁnite sums)
at all roots of unity, which implies that their radial limits exist and equal these values by
Abel’s theorem. Although Theorem 2.8 is only stated for Maass forms with trivial multiplier
for simplicity, a review of the proof shows that the method applies equally well to our Maass
waveforms with multipliers.

4. Further questions and outlook

There are several outstanding questions which naturally arise from the main results con-
sidered here. In what follows, we outline ﬁve interesting directions for future investigation.
1). As the example of σ, σ∗ indicates, it is worthwhile to look at the negative coeﬃcients
of the related Maass form. Thus, it is natural to ask: are there nice hypergeometric rep-
resentations for the q-series formed by the negative coeﬃcients of the Maass forms Gj,k,ℓ
in Theorem 1.2? If so, do they have relations to the q-hypergeometric series deﬁning the
Fj-functions, as σ and σ∗ satisfy? Such a connection could help explain general relationships
which have been observed by Li, Ngo, and Rhoades [12], as was further expounded upon
in [9]. However, the authors were unable to identify suitable Bailey pairs to make this idea
work in our case.

2). As in Theorem 2.5, we may also think of the Maass forms corresponding to the
Fj-functions as components of vector-valued Maass waveforms (as discussed in detail for
the σ, σ∗ case in [16]). Is it possible to ﬁnd nice q-hypergeometric interpretations for the
corresponding positive (or negative) coeﬃcients of the other components of such vectors as
well? That is, are the q-series associated to the expansions of the Maass waveforms at other
cusps than i∞ interesting from a q-series or combinatorial point of view?

k (x; q) :=Xn≥0
U (ℓ)
k (x; q) := q−kXn≥1

These are analogous to the series U (ℓ)

What sort of modular behavior is implied by these expansions?

5). As per the discussion in [12], there is hope that the Maass forms in Theorem 1.1
are related to Hecke characters or multiplicative q-series.
In fact, such connections were
related to all related examples of q-hypergeometric examples found in the literature, although
ﬁnding a general formulation seems intractable at the moment since as the discriminants of
the quadratic ﬁelds grow, explicitly identifying such characters becomes computationally
diﬃcult. However, explicitly identifying these characters for the inﬁnite families in Theorem
1.1 would be a major accomplishment, and could be very useful for forging new techniques
to generate Maass cusp forms.
