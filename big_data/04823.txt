Incidences between points on a variety and planes in R3∗

Abstract

In this paper we establish an improved bound for the number of incidences between
a set P of m points and a set H of n planes in R3, provided that the points lie on a two-
dimensional nonlinear irreducible algebraic variety V of constant degree. Speciﬁcally,
the bound is

O m2/3n2/3 + m6/11n9/11 logβ(m3/n) + m + n +Xℓ

|Pℓ| · |Hℓ|! ,

where the constant of proportionality and the constant exponent β depend on the degree
of V , and where the sum ranges over all lines ℓ that are fully contained in V and contain
at least one point of P , so that, for each such ℓ, Pℓ = P ∩ ℓ and Hℓ is the set of the

planes of H that contain ℓ. In addition, Pℓ |Pℓ| = O(m) and Pℓ |Hℓ| = O(n).

This improves, for this special case, the earlier more general bound of Apfelbaum

and Sharir [2] (see also [4, 7]).

This is a generalization of the incidence bound for points and circles in the plane [1,
3, 11], and is based on a recent result of Sharir and Zahl [13] on the number of cuts
that turn a collection of algebraic curves into pseudo-segments.

Introduction

Let P be a set of m points, and H a set of n planes in R3. Assume that P is contained in
some two-dimensional nonlinear and irreducible algebraic variety V of constant degree D.
We wish to bound the size I(P, H) of the incidence graph G(P, H), whose edges connect all
pairs (p, h) ∈ P × H such that p is incident to h. In general, and in this special setup too,
I(P, H) can be as large as the maximum possible value |P | · |H|, by placing all the points of
P on a line, and make all the planes of H contain this line, in which case G(P, H) = P × H.
The bound that we are going to obtain will of course acknowledge this possibility, and

will be of the form I0(P, H) + Pi |Pi| · |Hi|, where, for each i, Pi ⊆ P , Hi ⊆ H, and

Pi × Hi ⊆ G(P, H). Each subgraph Pi × Hi is induced by a line that contains all the points

of Pi and is contained in all the planes of Hi. Informally, the residue term I0(P, H) bounds
the number of “accidental” incidences, those that cannot be “explained” in terms of large
complete bipartite subgraphs of G(P, H). The quality of the bound will be measured by

I0(P, H) and by Pi (|Pi| + |Hi|).

Earlier works on point-plane incidences have considered the general setup, where the
points of P are arbitrarily placed in R3.
Initial partial results have been obtained by
Edelsbrunner, Guibas and Sharir [6]. More recently, Apfelbaum and Sharir [2] (see also
Brass and Knauer [4] and Elekes and T´oth [7]) have shown that if the incidence graph does
not contain a copy of Kr,s, for constant parameters r and s, then I(P, H) = O(m3/4n3/4 +
m + n).
In more generality, Apfelbaum and Sharir [2] have shown that if I = I(P, H)
is signiﬁcantly larger than this bound, then G(P, H) contains a large complete bipartite
subgraph P ′ × H ′, such that |P ′| · |H ′| = Ω(I 2/(mn)) − O(m + n). Moreover, as also
shown in [2] (slightly improving a similar result of Brass and Knauer [4]), G(P, H) can

be expressed as the union of complete bipartite graphs Pi × Hi so that Pi(|Pi| + |Hi|) =

O(m3/4n3/4 + m + n). (This is a specialization to the case d = 3 of a similar result of [2, 4]
in any dimension d.)

Nevertheless, as we show in this paper, the bound can be substantially improved when
all the points of P lie on a constant-degree variety V . Our main result is the following
theorem.

Theorem 1.1 For a set P of m points on some two-dimensional nonlinear and irreducible
algebraic variety V of constant degree D in R3, and for a set H of n planes in R3, the
incidence graph G(P, H) can be decomposed as

G(P, H) = G0(P, H) ∪[i

(Pi × Hi),

such that, for each i, Pi ⊆ P and Hi ⊆ H, and we have

|G0(P, H)| = O(cid:16)m2/3n2/3 + m6/11n9/11 logβ(m3/n) + m + n(cid:17) ,
Xi

and Xi

|Pi| = O(m)

|Hi| = O(n),

(1)

and

(2)

where the constant exponent β and the constants of proportionality depend on the degree D
of V .

We remark that the problem studied in this paper is not as specialized as it might appear.
It is a generalization of the problem of bounding the number of incidences between points
and circles of arbitrary radii in the plane. By applying the standard lifting transformation,
which maps each point (x, y) in the plane to the point (x, y, x2 + y2) on the paraboloid
z = x2 + y2 in 3-space, and maps each circle (x − a)2 + (y − b)2 = r2 to the plane z = 2ax +
2by +(r2 −a2 −b2), the problem becomes that of bounding the number of incidences between
points on the paraboloid and arbitrary planes in three dimensions. This transformation is
used in the second step of the analysis of the point-circle incidence problem, as in [1, 3],
and the bound derived there is very similar to the one in (2), except that, in the case of
circles, G(P, H) does not contain large complete bipartite graphs (in the sense that no line
can contain more than two points on the paraboloid), and the exponent β is equal to the
sharper value 2/11; see [1, 3, 11] for details.

2 Proof of Theorem 1.1

Let P , V , H, m, and n be as above. To obtain the bound (2) on I(P, H), we ﬁrst derive
a weaker bound, and then improve it via a suitable decomposition of dual space, similar to
the way it has been done for circles in [1, 3], and in more generality in [13].

A weak basic bound. Let L denote the set of lines fully contained in V and containing
at least one point of P . For each line ℓ ∈ L we form the bipartite subgraph Pℓ × Hℓ of
G(P, H), where Pℓ = P ∩ ℓ and Hℓ is the set of all the planes of H that contain ℓ. By Sharir
and Solomon [12, Lemma 5], except for at most one exceptional point, each point p ∈ V is
incident to at most D2 = O(1) lines of L.

If V contains an exceptional point p0 then it must be a cone with p0 as an apex, and
(since V is nonlinear) all the lines contained in V pass through p0. In this case we remove
p0 from P , losing at most n incidences, and re-apply the analysis to the set P \ {p0}, which
we continue to denote by P .

Ignoring then the exceptional point, if any, the preceding property implies thatPℓ |Pℓ| =

O(m). As V is irreducible and nonlinear, it does not contain any of the planes in H. Thus,
for each h ∈ H, the intersection h ∩ V is a (plane) algebraic curve of degree at most D, and
can therefore contain at most D = O(1) lines of L (as follows, e.g., from the generalized
version of B´ezout’s theorem [8], or by other, more direct arguments). This implies that

Pℓ |Hℓ| = O(n), and therefore Sℓ (Pℓ × Hℓ) is a portion of G(P, H), and Pℓ |Pℓ| = O(m),
and Pℓ |Hℓ| = O(n).

(Although not directly relevant to our analysis, it is instructive to note that if V is a
ruled surface,1 it contains inﬁnitely many lines, and L might then consist of a large number
(up to Θ(m)) of them. That is, ruled surfaces might yield a larger number of complete
bipartite subgraphs in G(P, H), but of smaller sizes; the linear bounds on the total size of
their vertex sets continue to hold. In contrast, as follows from the Cayley–Salmon theorem
(see, e.g., Guth and Katz [9]), a non-ruled irreducible variety of degree D can fully contain
at most D(11D − 24) lines. Hence, if V is not ruled, we also have this bound on the number
of complete bipartite graphs in (1).)

For each h ∈ H, put γh := (h ∩ V ) \ S L. As just noted, each γh is at most one-

dimensional. By construction, it does not contain any line, and it might also be empty (for
this or for other reasons). Note that if h ∩ V does contain a line ℓ, then ℓ ∈ L, and the
incidences between h and the points of P on ℓ are all already recorded in Pℓ × Hℓ. Finally,
we ignore the isolated points of γh. By Harnack’s curve theorem [10], the number of such
points on a plane h is O(D2) = O(1), so the isolated points contribute a total of at most
O(n) incidences. Let G0(P, H) denote the remaining portion of G(P, H), after pruning
away the complete bipartite graphs Pℓ × Hℓ. This gives us the decomposition in (1). We
further remove from G0(P, H) all the O(n) incidences involving isolated points on their
planes, continue to denote the resulting graph as G0(P, H), for notational convenience, and
put I0(P, H) = |G0(P, H)|.

Let Γ denote the set of the n curves γh, for h ∈ H. The curves of Γ are algebraic curves
of degree at most D, and any pair of curves γh, γh′ ∈ Γ intersect in at most D = O(1)

1That is, each point on V is incident to a line that is fully contained in V .

points. Indeed, any of these points is an intersection point of V with the line ℓ = h ∩ h′;
if ℓ is contained in V then, by construction, it is removed from both curves, and if ℓ is not
contained in V , it can meet it in at most D points.

Note that I0(P, H) is equal to the number of incidences I(P, Γ) between the points of

P and the curves of Γ. To bound the latter quantity we proceed as follows.

We slightly tilt the coordinate frame to make it generic, and then project the curves
of Γ onto the xy-plane. A suitable choice of the tilting guarantees that (i) no pair of
intersection points or points of P project to the same point, (ii) if p is not incident to
γh then the projections of p and of γh remain non-incident, and (iii) no pair of curves in
Γ have overlapping projections. In addition, by construction, no curve of Γ contains any
(vertical) segment. Let P ∗ and Γ∗ denote, respectively, the set of projected points and the
set of projected curves; the latter is a set of n plane algebraic curves of constant maximum
degree D (since the projection of a plane curve onto another plane clearly cannot increase
its degree). Moreover, I(P, Γ) is equal to the number of incidences between P ∗ and Γ∗.

By the result of Sharir and Zahl [13], applied to Γ∗, the curves of Γ∗ can be cut into
O(n3/2 logκ n) connected Jordan subarcs, where the constant exponent κ and the constant
of proportionality depend on D, so that each pair of subarcs intersect at most once.

We can now apply the crossing-lemma technique of Sz´ekely [14], exactly as was done
in Sharir and Zahl [13] or in earlier works. Since the resulting subarcs form a collection of
pseudo-segments, and the number of their intersections is O(n2), Sz´ekely’s analysis yields
the bound

I0(P, H) = I(P, Γ) = I(P ∗, Γ∗) = O(cid:16)m2/3n2/3 + m + n3/2 logκ n(cid:17) .

(3)

Adding incidences recorded in the complete bipartite decomposition, as constructed

above, and those involving isolated points, we get our initial (weak) bound.

I(P, H) = O m2/3n2/3 + m + n3/2 logκ n +Xℓ

|Pℓ| · |Hℓ|! ,

(4)

where Sℓ (Pℓ × Hℓ) is contained in the incidence graph G(P, H), and Pℓ |Pℓ| = O(m) and
Pℓ |Hℓ| = O(n).

The case m = O(n1/3). Before proceeding to improve the bound in (4), we ﬁrst dispose of
the case m = O(n1/3). As above, we ﬁrst remove all the complete bipartite graphs Pℓ × Hℓ,
for ℓ ∈ L, from G(P, H). We then proceed to estimate I0(P, H) as follows. We call a plane
h ∈ H strongly degenerate (or degenerate for short) if all the points of P ∩ h are collinear.
We claim that the number of incidences between points of P and non-degenerate planes is
O(m3 + n) = O(n). Indeed, ﬁrst discard the planes h ∈ H containing at most two points of
P , losing at most O(n) incidences. For an incidence between a point p ∈ P and a surviving
non-degenerate plane h ∈ H, there exist (at least) two distinct points q, s ∈ (P \ {p}) ∩ h
that are not collinear with p. The ordered triple (p, q, s) therefore uniquely accounts for the
incidence between p and h, and there are O(m3) = O(n) such triples.

To bound the number of incidences between the points of P and the degenerate planes
of H, ﬁx a degenerate plane h ∈ H, and assume that mh := |h ∩ P | ≥ D + 1; the overall

4

number of incidences on the other planes is at most Dn = O(n). By assumption, all points
of h ∩ P lie on a common line ℓ. Since ℓ contains at least D + 1 points, it must be contained
in V , so the incidences involving h are all recorded in the complete bipartite graph Pℓ × Hℓ.
In other words, we have shown, for m = O(n1/3),

I(P, H) = O n +Xℓ

|Pℓ| · |Hℓ|! ,

(5)

where, as above, Sℓ (Pℓ × Hℓ) is contained in the incidence graph G(P, H), and Pℓ |Pℓ| =
O(m) and Pℓ |Hℓ| = O(n).

Improving the bound. As in the analysis of incidences between points and circles (or
pseudo-circles) in [1, 3], and the more general treatment in [13], the ﬁrst two terms in
(3) dominate when m = Ω(n5/4 log3κ/2 n). When m is smaller, the third term, which is
independent of m, is the one that dominates, and we then sharpen it as follows (the same
general approach is also used in [1, 3, 13]).

We apply any standard duality to 3-space, which maps points to planes and planes to
points, and preserves point-plane incidences. We denote by a∗ the dual image (plane or
point) of an object a (point or plane). We thus get a set H ∗ of n points, and a set P ∗
of m planes in dual 3-space. We choose a parameter r, to be ﬁxed later, and construct a
(1/r)-cutting Ξ for P ∗ (see, e.g., [5]), which partitions the dual space into O(r3) simplices,
each crossed by at most m/r dual planes.

Incidences with boundary dual points. Let us ﬁrst bound the number of incidences
between the dual points that lie on the boundaries of the simplices and the dual planes.

(i) Each dual point that lies in the relative interior of a face of some simplex of Ξ (but not
on any edge of another simplex) has one incidence with the dual plane that contains that
face (if any), for a total of O(n) such incidences. If such a point h∗ is incident to another
dual plane p∗, then p∗ must cross both simplices adjacent to the face containing h∗. We
then assign h∗ to one of these simplices, and the relevant incidence will then be counted in
the subproblem associated with that simplex (see below).

(ii) Any incidence between a dual plane p∗ and a dual point h∗ that is a vertex of some
simplices of Ξ can be charged to the crossing of p∗ with some simplex σ of Ξ that is adjacent
to h∗. It follows that the number of incidences of this kind is at most O(r3)·m/r = O(mr2).

(iii) The remaining incidences involve points that lie on edges of the simplices; there are
O(r3) such edges. Fix one of these edges e. An incidence between a point h∗ ∈ e and a plane
p∗ that crosses e (intersects e but does not contain it) can be charged to the crossing of p∗
with some adjacent simplex (at most four such charges can be made to any plane-simplex
pair), and, as in (ii), the number of such incidences is only O(mr2).

(iv) We are thus left with incidences between dual points on e and dual planes that fully
contain e. Let ℓ∗ be the line supporting e. Back in the primal space, there exists a “pre-
image” ℓ of ℓ∗ such that all the dual planes p∗ that contain ℓ∗ come from points p that
lie on ℓ, and all the dual points h∗ that lie on ℓ∗ come from planes h that contain ℓ. If
ℓ ⊂ V then all these incidences are recorded in the corresponding complete bipartite graph

5

Pℓ × Hℓ that we have already constructed. Otherwise, ℓ can contain at most D points of
P , meaning that in dual space each point on any of these edges e is incident to at most D
dual planes that fully contain e. Since the sets of dual points lying on the (relative interiors
of the) edges e are pairwise disjoint, we get a total of at most O(nD) = O(n) incidences of
this latter kind.

Incidences within the simplices. We now proceed to consider incidences between dual
points in the interior of the simplices of Ξ. For each simplex σ of Ξ, let nσ denote the
number of points of H ∗ in the interior of σ, including the points that σ has “inherited”
from points on its faces, in step (i) of the preceding analysis. By duplicating cells σ for
which nσ > n/r3, so that in each copy we take at most n/r3 of these points (but retain
all the crossing planes), we obtain a collection of O(r3) simplices, each of which is crossed
by at most m/r dual planes and contains at most n/r3 dual points; we denote the actual
number of these planes and points as mσ and nσ (the latter notation is slightly abused, as
it now refers only to a single copy (subproblem) of σ), respectively, for each simplex σ.

For each cell σ, we apply the bound (4) to the subset P (σ) of the points of P whose
dual planes cross σ, and to the subset H (σ) of the planes whose dual points lie in σ, and
note that the case m/r = O((n/r3)1/3) does not arise, because then we would also have
m = O(n1/3), and then we would have used instead the bound (5), avoiding the partitioning
altogether. That is, we get, for each σ,

I(P (σ), H (σ)) = O m2/3

for a suitable complete bipartite decomposition Sℓ(cid:16)P (σ)

We sum these bounds, over the simplices σ of Ξ. We note that the same line ℓ may
arise in many complete bipartite graphs P (σ)
, but (i) all these graphs are contained
in Pℓ × Hℓ, and (ii) they are edge disjoint, because each dual point h∗ lies in at most one
simplex. This allows us to replace all the partial subgraphs P (σ)
by the single graph
Pℓ × Hℓ, for each line ℓ. We thus get

terms in the bound, which become O(m6/11n9/11 log2κ/11(m3/n)). (Note that 1 ≤ r ≤ m for
n1/3 ≤ m ≤ n5/4 log3κ/2 n.) The third term becomes mr2 = m3/11n10/11 log12κ/11(m3/n),

m4/11

which is dominated by the preceding bound for m = Ω(n1/3), as is easily checked. The
complementary case m = O(n1/3) has been handled by (5).

This completes the proof of Theorem 1.1. ✷

Remarks. (i) In retrospect, once we have reduced the problem to that of bounding the
number I(P ∗, Γ∗) on incidences between the projected points and curves on the xy-plane,
we could have applied, as a black-box, the analysis of Sharir and Zahl [13], and get a slightly
weaker bound with an additional (arbitrarily small) ε in the exponents. Exploiting the fact
that we are dealing here with planes allowed us to obtain the ﬁner bound in (2).

(ii) Note also that the preceding analysis closely follows the one in [1, 3], or, more precisely,
its enhanced version that exploits the bound O(n3/2 log n) of Marcus and Tardos [11] on the
number of cuts needed to turn a collection of circles into a collection of pseudo-segments
(so κ = 1 for the case of circles).
