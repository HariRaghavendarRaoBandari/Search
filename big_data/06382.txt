It is a belief that singularities are creation of general relativity and hence in the absence of a
quantum gravity, models of nonsingular black hole have received signiﬁcant attention. We study the
shadow (apparent shape), an optical appearance because of its strong gravitational ﬁeld, cast by a
nonsingular black hole which is characterized by three parameters, i.e., mass (M ), spin (a) and a
deviation parameter (k). The nonsingular black hole, under consideration, is a generalization of the
Kerr black hole can be recognized asymptotically (r >> k, k > 0) explicitly as the Kerr−Newman
black hole, and in the limit k → 0 as the Kerr black hole.
It turns out that the shadow of a
nonsingular black hole is a dark zone covered by deformed circle. Interestingly, it is seen that the
shadow of a black hole is aﬀected due to the parameter k.
Indeed, for a given a, the size of a
shadow reduces as the parameter k increases and the shadow becomes more distorted as we increase
the value of the parameter k when compared with the analogous Kerr black hole shadow. We also
investigate, in detail, how the ergoregion of a black hole is changed due to the deviation parameter
k.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The determination of black hole spin is an open issue
in astrophysics, which received a signiﬁcant attention us-
ing various methods [1–7].
It turns out that observa-
tion of a black hole shadow (apparent shape) may signif-
icantly help us to resolve this important open issue. It is
widely believed that the black hole shadow may contain
information about the nature of a black hole and size
of shadow around the black holes can help to calculate
black hole spin [8].
It is observed that the shape of a
rotating black hole is deformed in an optically thin emit-
ting medium due to the presence of spin [9–11], which for
the Schwarzschild black hole or a nonrotating black hole
is circular [12].

It is also believed that a supermassive black holes ex-
ist in the center of a galaxy. Falcke [11] determined
the formation of images of a supermassive black holes
to demonstrate a strong gravitational ﬁeld bent the tra-
jectories of photons released by the bright object and an
observer can see a dark zone around a black hole.
In
2002, Holz and Wheeler [13] detected the retro-images or
retro-MACHOS of the sun by a Schwarzschild black hole.
In [8], the author discussed the qualitative and quanti-
tative analyses of the shape and position of the rotating
black hole shadow on an optically thin accretion disk and
its dependence on the angular momentum.

A black hole casts a shadow as an optical appearance
because of its strong gravitational ﬁeld, which for the
Schwarzschild black hole is investigated in the pioneer

study of Synge [14] and Luminet [15], and also suggested
a formula to calculate the angular radius of the shadow
[14]. It is shown that a shadow of the Schwarzschild black
hole is a perfect circle [12] through the gravitational lens-
ing either in vacuum [16] or in plasma [17, 18]. Bardeen
[9] studied the appearance of a shadow cast by the Kerr
black hole (see also [10]). It can be seen for Kerr black
hole a shadow is no longer circular, it has deformed or dis-
torted shape in the direction of rotation [10, 11, 19–22].
The shadow of the Kerr black hole or a Kerr naked singu-
larity by constructing observable has been discussed by
Hioki and Maeda [23]. The shadow of several black holes
and naked singularities, have been rigorously studied in
the last few years, e.g. for Kerr−Newman black hole [24],
Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion black hole [26], Kerr-
Taub-NUT black hole [27], rotating braneworld black
hole [25], Kaluza-Klein rotating dilaton black hole [28],
rotating non-Kerr black hole [29], Kerr-Newman-NUT
black holes with cosmological constant [30]. The study of
shadow has also been, recently, extended for ﬁve dimen-
sional rotating Myers-Perry black hole [31]. Recently, a
signiﬁcant attention is devoted to study various regular
models [32–37] including its shadow [38–40].

In the absence of a well deﬁned quantum gravity, mod-
els of regular or nonsingular black holes have received sig-
niﬁcant attention [41–44]. In contrast to classical black
holes where singularities are unavoidable, the regular
black holes have horizons and their metrics as well as
their curvature invariants are well behaved everywhere.
Recently, Ghosh [45] employed a probability distribution
inspired mass function m(r) to replace the Kerr black
hole mass M to obtain a rotating nonsingular black hole.
The rotating nonsingular black hole has an additional
deviation parameter k. This rotating nonsingular black
hole is identiﬁed asymptotically (r >> k) exactly as the

Kerr−Newman black hole, and as the Kerr black hole
when k = 0. This rotating nonsingular black hole is a
generalization of the Kerr black hole. The subject of this
paper is to study the size and apparent shape of this ro-
tating nonsingular black hole and study changes due to
the parameter k by analyzing in detail the unstable circu-
lar orbits. Thus, we have studied the eﬀect of parameter
k on the shape of a shadow due to Kerr black and ana-
lyze the qualitative changes. As in case of the Kerr black
hole, we use two observables, the radius Rs and the dis-
tortion parameter δs, characterizing the apparent shape.
We found that these observables and hence the shape of a
shadow is aﬀected by the parameter k. Interestingly, the
size of a shadow decreases with parameter k for a given
value of a in rotating nonsingular black hole, thereby
suggesting a smaller shadow than in the Kerr black hole.
Thus the larger value of deviation parameter k leads to
decrease in the size of shadow and thus Rs decreases with
increase in k. The distortion of a shadow is character-
ized by the observable δs which for the case of rotating
nonsingular black hole increases monotonically with the
parameter k. Thus, the black hole becomes more dis-
torted or deformed with the increase in parameter k for
a given value of a.

The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II we brieﬂy
review the rotating nonsingular black hole and the study
of ergoregion for this black hole. In Sec. III, we obtain
the geodesics of the photon and also study of the eﬀective
potential. In Sec. IV, we obtain the apparent shapes of
the rotating nonsingular black hole and calculated the
observable, and in Sec. V we study the energy emission
rate of the black hole. Finally, we conclude in Sec. VI.

II. ROTATING NONSINGULAR BLACK HOLES

or

The metric of the rotating nonsingular black holes was
obtained in Ref. [45], which in Boyer−Lindquist coordi-
nates (t, r, θ, φ), with gravitational units G = c = 1,
reads:

ds2 = −(cid:18)1 −

2M re−k/r

Σ

(cid:19) dt2 +

Σ
∆

dr2 + Σdθ2

4aM re−k/r

Σ

−
+ (cid:20)r2 + a2 +

sin2 θdtdφ

2M ra2e−k/r

Σ

sin2 θ(cid:21) sin2 θdφ2, (1)

where Σ and ∆ are given by

Σ = r2 + a2 cos2 θ and ∆ = r2 + a2 − 2M re−k/r. (2)
The parameters M , a, and k (k > 0), respectively, repre-
sent the mass, spin, and deviation parameter. The met-
ric (1) reduces to the Kerr solution [46] if the parameter
k = 0, and the Schwarzschild solution for both k = a = 0
[47]. The detailed analysis of the horizon structure and
energy condition of the metric (1) is also discussed [45].

2

It is noted that metric (1) is singular at ∆ = 0 and
Σ = 0. However, ∆ = 0 is a coordinate singularity. It is
seen that the metric (1), for r >> k, can be identiﬁed as
Kerr−Newman [48], i.e., for r >> k one gets

2M r − q2

gtt = 1 −
∆ = r2 + a2 − 2M r + q2 + O(k2/r2),

+ O(k2/r2),

Σ

where the charge q and M are related to the deviation
parameter k via q2 = 2M k.

A. Ergoregion

The event horizon of the black hole is a null surface

determined by grr = ∆ = 0, thus the zeros of

r2 + a2 − 2M re−k/r = 0,

(3)

give the black hole horizons. The numerical solution of
Eq. (3) reveals that, for a suitable choice of parameters, it
admits two roots r− and r+, which correspond to Cauchy
and event horizons, respectively [45]. Furthermore, it is
worthwhile to understand that one can ﬁnd values of pa-
rameters such that r+ = r−, which means one gets an
extremal black hole, and r+ > r− describes a nonex-
tremal black hole. The horizons exist only for the certain
range of the parameters [45]. On the other hand, at the
static limit surface, the timelike Killing vector ξa = ( ∂
∂t )a
becomes null, i.e.,

ξaξa = gtt = 0,

r2 + a2 cos2 θ − 2M re−k/r = 0.

(4)

(5)

EH < r < r+

By solving Eq. (5) numerically, it turns out that the met-
ric (1) admits two positive roots (cf. [45] for details). The
region between r+
SLS is called ergoregion. In
an ergoregion the gravitational forces changes the move-
ment of an object, and an object in this region can no
longer remain stationary. In this region, an object can
escape the gravitational forces of the black hole if the
speed of this object is greater than the escape velocity.
One of the important property of an ergoregion is that
in this region, a timelike killing vector becomes spacelike
or vice versa. It is known that an ergoregion plays a sig-
niﬁcant role in the energy extraction process or Penrose
process of a black hole [49].

The plots of ergoregions of the Kerr black hole (k = 0)
can be seen from Fig. 1 for diﬀerent values of spin a, it
shows that the ergoregion area increases with a. We have
shown the eﬀect of parameter k on the shape of an er-
goregion in Figs. 2. It can be observed from these ﬁgures
that the ergoregion is easily eﬀected by the parameter
k. It can be seen from the Fig. 2, one can ﬁnd a critical
value of k (kc) where event and Cauchy horizons almost

coincide (near extremal black hole). It can be observed
for k > kc, the horizons are disconnected (cf. Fig. 2).
One can easily observe from the Fig. 2, that there is an
increase in the ergoregion area with the parameter k for a
given value of spin a. It turns out that the critical values
of parameter kc = 0.5565, 0.4758, 0.3876, 0.2938, 0.1981
correspond, respectively, for a = 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8.

III. GEODESICS IN NONSINGULAR BLACK

HOLE

In this section, we present the calculation necessary
for the shape of black hole shadow, which demands the
study of geodesics motion around the nonsingular black
hole (1). The rotating nonsingular spacetime is charac-
terized by three constants of the motion which are energy
E, component of angular momentum Lz and the Carter
constant K. To derive the geodesic equations ﬁrst we
start with the Lagrangian

(10)
The remaining geodesic equations for the rotating non-
singular black hole with metric tensor gµν , can be de-
termined by using Hamilton−Jacobi equation, which has
the following form

Eq. (11) has a solution of the following form

S =

0σ − Et + Lzφ + Sr(r) + Sθ(θ),

(12)

where m0 corresponds to the rest mass of the particle,
Sr and Sθ are functions of r and θ, respectively. Further-
more, one can obtain the geodesic equations by using
Eqs. (11) and (12), and separating out the coeﬃcients of
r and θ equal to the Carter constant (±K),

with E and Lz, respectively, energy and angular momen-

tions by solving Eqs. (7) and (8), simultaneously

without loss of generality one can take m0 = 1 for par-
ticles, and m0 = 0 for photons. We are interested in
photon trajectories therefore the Eq. (15) transforms into

FIG. 3: Plot showing the behavior of the eﬀective potential for diﬀerent values of k with χ = 4, and ζ = 1.

Now, we introduce dimensionless quantities such that
χ = Lz/E and ζ = K/E2, which are constant along the
geodesics therefore in terms of these quantities Eq. (17)
looks like as

R = E2(cid:2)r2 + a2 − aχ(cid:3)2

− E2(cid:16)r2 + a2 − 2M re−k/r(cid:17)(cid:2)ζ + (χ − a)2(cid:3) .

(18)

Furthermore, to discuss the radial motion of the particle,
the eﬀective potential is very important tool which can
be calculated by using the equation [26]

(cid:18)Σ

dr

dσ(cid:19)2

+ Vef f = 0,

(19)

If one substitutes k = 0, we get

χ =

(r2 + a2)r2 + M r(−3r2 + a2)

ar(M − r)

,

(24)

ζ =

4a2M r5 − r5(r − 3M )2

a2r2(M − r)2

,

(25)

which are exactly same as the Kerr black hole [23]. Sim-
ilarly, in the limit k → 0, all quantities in this section
correspond to the Kerr black hole [23]. The dependence
of the parameter k with the particular choice of χ and ζ
can be seen by the Fig. 3. It shows that there are var-
ious bounds of the eﬀective potential according to the
parameter k.

thence, the expression of eﬀective potential (Vef f = −R)
reads

IV. NONSINGULAR BLACK HOLE SHADOW

Vef f = −E2(cid:2)r2 + a2 − aχ(cid:3)2

+ E2(r2 + a2 − 2M re−k/r)(cid:2)ζ + (χ − a)2(cid:3) .

(20)

Indeed, the eﬀective potential is not only depends on
parameter k but also on χ and ζ. Next, we are interested
in circular orbits of the photons to ﬁnd out χ and ζ,
which satisfy [50]

Vef f = 0

and

dVef f

dr

= 0,

(21)

by using Eqs. (20) and (21), we can easily get the param-
eters χ and ζ in the following form

Next, we study the shadow of the rotating nonsingu-
lar black hole. Consider, the photons released from the
bright object are coming towards the black hole which is
situated between an observer and a bright object. There
should be three possible trajectories of photon geodesics
around the black hole; (i) falling into the black hole (cap-
ture orbits), (ii) scattered away from black hole to inﬁnity
(scatter orbits), and (iii) critical geodesics which separate
the ﬁrst two sets (unstable orbits). The observer which
is far away from the black hole can see only the scat-
tered photons while those photons which are fall into the
black hole form a dark region. This dark region is known
as the black hole shadow. Furthermore, to study about
this dark region or black hole shadow we are going to
deﬁne the new coordinates (α, β) [9], which are known as
celestial coordinates deﬁned by

α = lim

r0→∞(cid:18)−r2

0 sin θ0

dφ

dr(cid:19) ,

β = lim

r0→∞(cid:18)r2

0

dθ

dr(cid:19) ,

(26)

(27)

where r0 is the radius of circular orbits and θ0 repre-
sents the inclination angle between the rotation axis of
the black hole and the direction to an observer. By us-
ing Eqs. (9), (10), (13) and (14), we can easily calcu-
late dφ/dr and dθ/dr when plunge these values in the
Eqs. (26) and (27), the celestial coordinates read [9, 10]:

α = −χ csc θ0,

(28)

β = ±qζ + a2 cos2 θ0 − χ2 cot2 θ0.

(29)

Β

where θ0 is the inclination angle between the rotation
axis and the direction to an observer.
If an observer
is situated in the equatorial plane of the black hole, in
this case the inclination angle is θ0 = π/2. Hence, the
Eqs. (28) and (29) transform into

Next, to visualize the shapes of black hole shadow, we
need to plot β vs α where coordinates α and β satisfy
the following relation

α2 + β2 = χ2 + ζ.

(32)

Using Eqs. (22), (23), and (32) we can obtain

α2 + β2 =

1

(kM + M r − r2ek/r)2h2r2

× (cid:16)r4e2k/r + M 2(k2 − 2kr − 3r2)(cid:17)
+ a2(cid:16)r2ek/r + M (k + r)(cid:17)2i.

(33)

Now we can plot shadow of the rotating nonsingular black
hole (1) by using Eq. (32). It is clear that the shapes or
the contours of a black hole shadow depends on its spin,
inclination angle and parameter k. We shall plot α vs
β to display the contour of the shadow of the nonsingu-
lar black hole for various values of a and k at diﬀerent
inclination angle.

A. Nonrotating case

We ﬁrst consider the nonrotating case, a = 0, in which
case the metric (1) reduced to one obtain in [51]. In this
case the parameters α and β satisfy

α2 + β2 =

where, r0 is the radius of circular orbits. The black hole
shadow or plots of Eq. (34) are presented in the Fig. 4.
They are perfect circles. It can be observe from the plots
that the parameter k reduces the radius of the shadow

B. Rotating case

It is shown that for a rotating black hole the shadow
has an apical deformation due to spin parameters, in-

stead of being perfect circle. Here we wish to further
analyze the eﬀect of parameter k on the apparent shapes
of rotating nonsingular black hole. Furthermore, if k = 0,
Eq. (33) reduces to

α2 + β2 =

2r2(r2 − 3M 2) + a2(r + M )2

(r − M )2

.

(36)

Now, consider the case when the spin is non zero, i.e., a 6=
0. We have plotted the shapes of the shadow from Figs. 6,
7 and 8.
In Fig. 6, we show the contours of the black
hole shadow for various values of deviation parameter k
with diﬀerent inclination angle θ0.
Indeed, the shapes
of the shadow are depended on the inclination angle of
the observer. Furthermore, the Fig. 7 shows the eﬀect of
parameter k on the shadow of black hole. It is clear from
Fig. 7 that when a and k take critical values, the shape of
the shadow is more deformed. The eﬀect of the parameter
k in the presence of spin a on the shapes of black shadow
can be seen from the Fig. 8 which shows that if a increases
then the shapes of the black hole shadow are shifted to
right.

Furthermore, to calculate the actual size and distor-
tion of the black hole shadow, let us deﬁne the observ-
able which characterize the black hole shadow, namely
Rs and δs. The parameters Rs and δs corresponding to
the actual size of the shadow and distortion in the shape

of the shadow, respectively. The radius of the shadow
can be calculated by considering a circle passing through
the three points top, bottom, and rightmost correspond-
ing to the (αt,βt), (αb,βb), and (αr,0), respectively [23].
The deﬁnitions of these observable are given by [23]

Rs =

and

(αt − αr)2 + β2

t

2(αt − αr)

,

(37)

δs =

( ˜αp − αp)

Rs

,

(38)

where ( ˜αp, 0) and (αp, 0) are the points where reference
circle and the contour of the shadow cut the horizontal
axis at opposite side of (αr, 0). The plots of the observ-
able can be seen from the Fig. 9 which shows that when
the parameter k increases then the radius of the shadow
decreases and the distortion increases.

V. ENERGY EMISSION RATE

we know that the limiting constant value of absorption
cross section for a spherically symmetric black hole is

energy emission rate [26] by

then one obtains Hawking temperature

for the Kerr black hole [52]. The plots of energy emis-
sion rate (d2E(ω)/dωdt) versus frequency (ω) can be seen
from the Fig. 10 for a = 0 and a = 0.9 by varying the
parameter k. It is clear that for small values of k, the en-
ergy emission rate is high and if it takes maximum value
then the energy emission rate is low.

VI. CONCLUSION

The investigation of shadow of diﬀerent types of black
hole has been an important subject of research because
that the observations of a black hole in the centre of a
galaxy may be determined [11]. The shadow of a Kerr
black hole is distorted mainly by its spin parameter and
the inclination angle, which otherwise is a perfect circle
for the Schwarzschild black hole.

In this paper, we make a qualitative analysis of the
shapes of the black hole shadow cast by a rotating non-
singular black hole which has an additional deviation pa-
rameter k and also perform a detail study of it’s erore-
gion. The dependence of black hole shadows and ergore-
gions on spin a and parameter k are explicitly shown.
With the help of study of null geodesics around the ro-
tating nonsingular black hole, we construct the parame-
ters ζ and χ by using the circular orbits conditions and
discuss the behavior of eﬀective potential. We consider
the black hole shadow for both nonrotating and rotating
cases to bring out the eﬀect of spin a and parameter k.
The shape of shadows for nonrotating black hole are per-
fect circles and the size decreases with increasing value
of k.
In the next paragraph, we studied the shape of

shadows for rotating black hole. In this case the shape
is not perfect circle but it is deformed due to the pres-
ence of spin a and parameter k. One can observe that
the area of ergoregion increases with an increase either
in parameter k or spin a. The observable Rs and δs are
deﬁned to characterized the shape of black hole shadow.
We demonstrate inﬂuence of the parameter k on observ-
ables Rs and δs. It shows that the value of Rs decreases
and δs increases with the parameter k.

The results obtained are similar to the Kerr black hole

shadows [23], but the size of a shadow decreases due to
the deviation parameter k. We also observe the peak of
an eﬀective potential towards the central object. The
results obtained here may give insight to understand the
qualitatively features of a regular black holes. We have
done detailed analysis of a rotating nonsigular black hole
from viewpoint of ergoregion and shadow that contains
the Kerr black hole analysis as the special case when the
deviation parameter, k = 0.
