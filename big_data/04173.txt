It is evident that eye blinks in general and the BR particularly
is linked to brain activity. In this paper, we investigate the
relationship between the blink rate variability and two activities
reading a passage and testing memory. To estimate blink rate
variability, we utilize a blink detection algorithm that we
proposed earlier [8] and brieﬂy describe in section 3. The
experimental setup is described in section 2. In the sections 4
we discuss on the relationship between the blink rate and the
task, and in section 5 we elaborate on the statistical properties
of blink rate variability and their relationship to the reading
task and memory test.

Abstract—In this paper we investigated how statistical prop-
erties of the blink rate variability changes during two mental
tasks: reading a passage and memory testing. To construct time
series of inter-blink intervals (blink rate variability) we detected
exact blink time in EEG recordings using our blink detection
algorithm. We found that among 13 subjects, all subjects blinked
less during reading session. Moreover, standard deviation of the
blink rate variability is higher during reading. Thus, we conclude
that the variability of inter-blink intervals decreases during tasks
that require concentration and intense mental activity.

Blinking is a semi-autonomic closing of the eyelids. Occur-
rence, reasons and characteristics of blink rate, varies between
animals, and it is possible to trace the evolution of the blinking
mechanisms through species. [1]. Every blink is associated
with a spread of oils and mucous secretions across the surface
of the eye to keep eyes from getting dry and disinfect them.
Reduced blink rate causes eye redness and dryness also known
as Dry Eye, which belongs to the major symptoms of the
Computer Vision Syndrome [2]. Besides blink keeps eyes
protected against potentially damaging stimuli, such as bright
lights and foreign bodies like dust.
However, people don’t even notice the world going into
darkness every few seconds. The sudden changes in an image
due to saccades or blinks, do not interfere with our subjective
experience of continuity, the very act of blinking suppresses an
activity in several areas of the brain responsible for detecting
environmental changes, so that one experience the world as
continuous.
The blinks have been known to be linked to interior brain
activities. Ponder and Kennedy implicated that high processes
are major determinants of Blink enhancements and inhibition
[4]. Moreover, it has been reported the synchronous behavior
in blinking between listener and speaker in face-to-face con-
versation [3].
Researchers have shown that blinks can play a signiﬁcant role
in detecting many different brain disorder and brain activities.
Spontaneous Blink Rate (BR) has been studied in many
neurological diseases like Parkinson’s disease and Tourette
syndrome [5], [6], [7]. The use of blink detection does not
stop there. Researchers have found that blink rates can be
used as a source of data in detecting psychiatric disorders like
schizophrenia and attention hyperactivity all this is because
blinks are regarded as non-invasive peripheral markers of the
central dopamine activity which makes their accurate detection

The video stream while subjects were performing the test
was captured with a Pointgrey Flea3 high frame rate USB
camera. We stored the video for future work. Simultaneously,
EEG signals were recorded using Mitsar-EEG 201 ampliﬁer
and accompanying WinEEG software. The electrodes were
placed according to the international 10-20 system standards
of electrode placement [9]. Electro-gel was injected into elec-
trodes hollow in order to decrease the electrode-skin resistance.
Currently, we are more focused on the recording of the blinks
than the brain data, but In the future we are planning to
analyze EEG to detect different types of brain activities while
performing these exams.

Eighteen young subjects (15 men and 3 women) aged from
19-25 years, were recruited for the experiment. All provided
their written consent. The subjects had no history of psychiatric
illness and they had not been affected by any signiﬁcant
medical, neurological or ophthalmological illness. To avoid
substance abuse, we prepared a questionnaire testifying that
they had none of these issues. Among them, ﬁve subjects
were dropped due to heavy noise caused by the subjects falling
asleep, adjusting the cap or constant head movements.
The test for the data recording session consisted of two dif-
ferent stages: (a) reading passage, and (b) comprehension test.
The testing software was developed in Java. It was designed
in such a way that it does not require any interventions from
either the subjects or the experiment supervisor to conduct this
experiment. The whole testing session took 10 minutes. The
ﬁrst 5 minutes is the passage reading session. The passage
consists of basic facts about Ethiopia, and the target of this
passage was to record data while subjects were trying to
comprehend the passage. Lastly, subjects were given a 5
minutes comprehension test about the passage. The questions
were derived from the information provided in the passage.
It was designed to get subject to retrieve the facts from the
memory. Since EEG is prone to noise due to movement, we
made sure that subjects answered the question by using the
numbers from 1 to 6 on the keypad.

PREPRIN T

EEG signals were recorded while participants were taking
the tests. We used bipolar montage while recording these
signals, i.e. signals are the potentials between Fp1 and Fp3
electrodes, and Fp2 and Fp4 electrodes. The recordings were
then imported in the form of CSV ﬁles to Matlab for further
analysis. The process of blink detection is described in our
previous work [8]. Here we brieﬂy outline it.
Generally, the blink detection is divided into two parts: the pre-
processing part and the blink detection part. The preprocessing
part consists of the following steps: (a) bandpass ﬁltering, (b)
cut extreme amplitudes using estimated cumulative distribu-
tion function, characterizing signal amplitudes distribution, (c)
independent component analysis and (d) selection of the inde-
pendent component with eye blinks. The blink detection part
of the detection algorithm consists of (d) signal thresholding,
(e) candidate extraction, (f) polynomial ﬁtting with ﬁnding

IV. BLINK RATE AND BLINK RATE VARIABILITY DURING

In the work by Bentivoglio et al, BR during rest, read-
ing and conversation was studied. The authors investigated
the blink rate (BR) patterns; they showed that the patterns
inﬂuenced more by cognitive processes rather than by age,
eye color or gender [10]. Hart H.W distinguishes three types
of an eye blink: spontaneous, reﬂex and voluntary[11]. He
also estimated that blinks occur on average, about 12 -15

times/min [11]. It was noted that spontaneous BR increases
at the evening time [12]. The study of BR at the evening time
is especially important due to the fact that the ninth cause of
death globally are car accidents according to World Health
Organization (WHO) and the big part of the accidents are
caused by the drowsiness of drivers. According to National
Motor Vehicle Crash Causation Survey (NMVCCS) 30% of
car accidents occur in the evenings [13]. It is known that
workload increases heart rate and heart rate are known to
decrease in monotonous and drowsy conditions [14]. BR is
inversely correlated with increase of workload, so blinks can
be used to detect drowsiness before bad consequences occur
[14].
We investigate how number of blinks changes depending on
the task. We considered two tasks: reading and memory test
based on the text that subjects were given. Among 13 subjects,
all blinked less while reading. Holland et. al reported that
blinking is related to certain cognitive processes. The authors
state that blinking is a function of memory load, such that
the more items in memory, the fewer the blinks. Reading is a
process in which the eyes quickly move to assimilate text. It is
necessary to understand visual perception and eye movement
in order to understand the reading process. Reading involves a
prolonged focus on reading material as each words is related
to its predecessors to make sense of the whole sentence.
Operational memory, which is used during solving mental
tasks, and visual imagination, may share components with a
visual perceptual system. To avoid interference of cognitive
processes, blinking is slowed down [16]. Number of blinks
per each of 13 subjects is presented in Fig.6.

Comprehension test, as the task involving memory, in-
creases BR, while reading reduces it. Reading text that contains
new information appears to be a heavier mental process than
memory testing, and operational memory is more in use.
Moreover, logical constructions in the text are longer, and ideas
are more developed than in the test. Therefore, there could be a
reﬂection in concept of blinking as an interlude between ideas
or sentences [16].
Time between blinks changes, for reading it is shorter and
elongates for test. Fig. 9 presents average inter-blink per each
subject
in both stages, reading and memory test. Fig. 10
shows standard deviation of IBI dynamics. Longer inter-blink
in reading is caused because of ﬁxation points while reading.
Humans read each word at a time this is called ﬁxation. From
one ﬁxation to another there is a search for the next ﬁxation

Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 show BRV for all of the subjects
during reading and testing comprehension. The X-axis is the

so this requires less blinks and more focus. Also longer inter-
blinks are caused by the fact that reading is a cognitive process
that increases brain activity [17].

In 1927 Ponder and Kennedy reported that high processes
are major determinants of blink enhancements and inhibition.
They also mentioned that blinks might serve as an index of at-
tention, or as they termed it mental tension. They inferred that
person inhibits blinking while actively engaged in information
abstraction. Interesting results were presented by Hall, who
concluded that blinks do not occur randomly during reading.
Our results have shown that there is lesser number of blinks
in reading a passage than performing a memory test. Reading
has lower blink rates because people read sentences by ﬁxating
on words, which results in a decrease of blinking rates. Our
ﬁndings supports[17] that blink behavior during reading is
under perceptual and cognitive control. Even though it was a
different experiment set up our ﬁnding is concurrent with the
ﬁndings of [18] that reports on a signiﬁcant and a positive cor-
relation between inter blink intervals and subsequent memory
encoding. Our results show higher blink rates while subjects
performed the memory test. In summary our experiment shows
that inter blink intervals have strong correlation with the task a
person is performing. Our ﬁndings can lead to further studies
on the correlation between IBIs and different human activities.
