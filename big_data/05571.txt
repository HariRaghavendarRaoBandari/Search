Abstract

We consider a gravitating system consisting of a scalar ﬁeld minimally coupled to gravity with a

self-interacting potential and a U(1) nonlinear electromagnetic ﬁeld. Solving analytically and nu-

merically the coupled system for both power-law and Born-Infeld electrodynamics, we ﬁnd charged

hairy black hole solutions. Then, we study the thermodynamics of these solutions and we ﬁnd that

at a low temperature the topological charged black hole with scalar hair is thermodynamically

preferred, whereas the topological charged black hole without scalar hair is thermodynamically

preferred at a high temperature for power-law electrodynamics. Interestingly enough, these phase

transitions occur at a ﬁxed critical temperature and do not depend on the exponent p of the

nonlinearity electrodynamics.

INTRODUCTION

Hairy black holes are interesting solutions to Einstein’s Theory of Gravity and also to cer-

tain types of Modiﬁed Gravity Theories. The ﬁrst attempts to couple a scalar ﬁeld to gravity

was done in an asymptotically ﬂat spacetime ﬁnding hairy black hole solutions [1], but these

solutions violated the no-hair theorems [2]. Then, by introducing a cosmological constant,

hairy black hole solutions with a minimally coupled scalar ﬁeld and a self-interaction po-

tential in asymptotically dS space were found, but unstable [3, 4]. Also, a hairy black

hole conﬁguration was reported for scalar ﬁeld non-minimally coupled to gravity [5], but a

perturbation analysis showed the instability of the solution [6, 7]. In the case of a negative

cosmological constant, stable solutions were found numerically for spherical geometries [8, 9]

and an exact solution in asymptotically AdS space with hyperbolic geometry was presented

in [10]. Then, a generalization to non-conformal solutions was discussed in [11]. Further

hairy solutions in the presence of a cosmological constant were reported in [12–16] with vari-

ous properties. On the other hand, by introducing a coupling of a scalar ﬁeld to an Einstein

tensor that acts as an eﬀective cosmological constant [17, 18], a hairy black hole solution

was presented [19], and spherically symmetric hairy black hole solutions with scalar hair

were found [20]. Furthermore, charged hairy solutions were also found, for instance in [21] a

topological black hole dressed with a conformally coupled scalar ﬁeld and electric charge was

studied. An electrically charged black hole solution with a scalar ﬁeld minimally coupled

to gravity and electromagnetism was presented in [22]. Recently, for a gravitating system

consisting of a scalar ﬁeld minimally coupled to gravity with a self-interacting potential and

U(1) electromagnetic ﬁeld, exact charged hairy black hole solutions with the scalar ﬁeld

which is regular everywhere have been found in [23]. Also, new hairy black hole solutions,

boson stars and numerical rotating hairy black hole solutions were discussed [24–29], as well

as time-dependent hairy black holes [30, 31].

In this work, we extend our previous work [16, 23] and we consider a gravitating system

consisting of a scalar ﬁeld minimally coupled to gravity with a self-interacting potential and

U(1) nonlinear electromagnetic ﬁeld. Then, we obtain black hole solutions for power-law and

Born-Infeld electrodynamics and we study the thermodynamics and the phase transitions

between hairy charged black holes dressed with a scalar ﬁeld and no hairy charged black

holes, focusing on the eﬀects of the nonlinearity of the Maxwell source. The interest in

3

nonlinear electrodynamics arises with the order to eliminate the problem of inﬁnite energy of

the electron by Born and Infeld [32]. Also, nonlinear electrodynamics emerge in the modern

context of the low-energy limit of heterotic string theory [33–35], and play an important

role in the construction of regular black hole solutions [36–41]. Furthermore, the eﬀects of

nonlinear electrodynamics on the properties of the holographic superconductor have recently

been investigated [42–48]. The thermodynamics of Einstein-Born-Infeld black holes with a

negative cosmological constant was studied in [49] and for a power-law electrodynamic in

[50], where the authors showed that a set of small black holes are locally stable by computing

the heat capacity and the electrical permittivity. On the other hand, higher dimensional

topological black hole solutions to Einstein-dilaton theory coupled to a power-law Maxwell

ﬁeld were found in [51], and topological black hole solutions of the Brans-Dicke theory in

the presence of a power-law Maxwell ﬁeld as the matter source in [52].

The phase transitions have been of great interest since the discovery of a phase transition

by Hawking and Page in a four-dimensional Schwarzschild AdS background [53]. Witten

[54] has extended this four-dimensional transition to arbitrary dimension and provided a

natural explanation of a conﬁnement/deconﬁnement transition on the boundary ﬁeld theory

via the AdS/CFT correspondence. However, phase transitions have recently garnered a

great deal of attention motivated mainly by the relationship between the phase transitions

and holographic superconductivity [55, 56] in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence.

It is known that these phase transitions can be obtained by considering black holes as

states in a same grand canonical ensemble and by comparing the free energy associated

with each of them. So, it is necessary to ﬁnd the conserved charge of the theory.

It is

worth mentioning that the phase transition phenomena have been analyzed and classiﬁed

by exploiting Ehrenfest’s scheme [57–60]. Another point of view to study phase transitions

is to consider Bragg-Williams’ construction of a free energy function [61]. Phase transitions

of hairy topological black holes have been studied in [62, 63]. Also, it was shown that if

the space is ﬂat, then the Reissner-Nordstr¨om black hole is thermodynamically preferred,

whereas if the space is AdS the hairy charged black hole is thermodynamically preferred at

a low temperature [23].

The work is organized as follows. In Section II we present the general formalism. Then,

we derive the ﬁeld equations and we ﬁnd hairy black hole solutions. In Section III we study

the thermodynamics of our solutions and in Section IV we present our conclusions.

The four-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert action with a scalar ﬁeld minimally coupled to cur-

(5)

where dΩ2 is the metric of the spatial 2 section, which can have a positive, negative or zero

curvature, and Aµ = (At(r), 0, 0, 0) is the scalar potential of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. We

ﬁnd the following three independent diﬀerential equations

r(cid:17) ,

where ν is a parameter controlling the behavior of the scalar ﬁeld and it has the dimension

of length, from Eqs. (9) and (11) we determine the function a(r), which reads

Also, from the Maxwell equations

a (r) =pr (r + ν) .

∂µ(cid:18)√−gF µν dL(F 2)

In the following sections we will consider two speciﬁc electromagnetic Lagrangians L(F 2):
Power-law and Born-Infeld electrodynamics.

A. Power-law electrodynamics

Power-law electrodynamics are characterized by the following Lagrangian

where p is a rational number. Now, from Maxwell equations (14) we obtain

L(F 2) = η(−F 2)p ,

A′t(r) =

Q

(r(r + ν))1/(2p−1) ,

(17)

(18)

where Q is an integration constant related to ˜Q by ˜Q = η2p−1p(Q2)p/Q. So

At(r) =

ν(cid:21) + C .

(19)

The integration constant C will be chosen in such a way the electric potential goes to zero

asymptotically for 1/2 < p < 3/2, and is given by

C = −Q(1/ν)

1−2p(cid:17) Γ(cid:16) 3−2p
−1+2p(cid:17)
Γ(cid:16) 2−2p
−1+2p(cid:17)
Γ(cid:16) 1
Thus, for r → ∞ the electric potential behaves as:
1 − 2p
3 − 2p

At(r → ∞) ≈ Q

1−2p + . . . ,

3−2p

(20)

(21)

where . . . denotes terms that goes to zero at large distances. Eq. (21) shows that the ﬁeld At

tends to zero at inﬁnity for 1/2 < p < 3/2 and diverges at inﬁnity for p < 1/2 and p > 3/2.
However, the above solution is not valid for n = 1/(2p − 1) with n > 1 being an integer.
Fortunately, in that case we obtain analytical solutions that we present in the Appendix.

We can also determine the metric function f (r) replacing (19) in (15). We ﬁnd

The integral above apparently depends on ν; however, it can be shown numerically that the

integral does not depend on ν; so, in the last line of the above expression we have set ν = 1

for simplicity. Therefore, ν is actually an integration constant. Then, we can investigate

whether our system has a charged hairy black hole solution. In Fig. 1 we plot the behavior

of the metric function f (r) and the potential V (φ) in Fig. 2, for a choice of parameters
ν = 0.5, Λ = −1, α1 = 1, α2 = 1, p = 2, 3, 5 and k = ±1, 0. The metric function f (r)
changes sign for low values of r, signaling the presence of a horizon, while the potential

tends to Λ = V (0) (V (0) < 0) as can be seen in Fig. 2. Additionally, we have checked the

behavior of the Kretschmann scalar RµνρσRµνρσ(r) outside the black hole horizon. As shown

in Fig. 3, there is no curvature singularity outside the horizon.

Eq. (22) has an analytical solution for p = 3/4 given by

cally that these expressions do not depend on ν; for this reason, we have set ν = 1 in (38)

for simplicity. So, ν is actually an integration constant.

Then, we can investigate whether our system has a charged hairy black hole solution.

In Fig. 6 we plot the behavior of the metric function f (r) and the potential V (φ) in Fig.
7, for a choice of parameters Λ = −1, α1 = 0.01, α2 = 1.5, b = 1 and ν = 1, 2, 5. The
metric function f (r) changes sign for low values of r signaling the presence of a horizon,

while the potential tends to Λ = V (0) (V (0) < 0), as can be seen in Fig. 7. Additionally,

we have checked the behavior of the Kretschmann scalar RµνρσRµνρσ(r) outside the black

12

hole horizon. As shown in Fig. 8 there is no curvature singularity outside the horizon.

III. THERMODYNAMICS

In this section we will study the thermodynamics of the hairy black hole solutions found.

To compute the conserved charges we will apply the Euclidean formalism, we will work in

the ρ =pr (r + ν) coordinate, in which the metric (5) can be written in the following form:

ds2 = −N(ρ)2g(ρ)2dt2 +

1
g(ρ)2 dρ2 + ρ2dΩ2 ,

(39)

where

N (ρ)2 =

ρ2

(cid:0) ν2
4 + ρ2(cid:1)

, g (ρ)2 =

f (ρ)

ρ2 (cid:18) ν2

4

+ ρ2(cid:19) ,

(40)

and where f (ρ) corresponds to the metric function f (r) evaluated at r = − ν
In these coordinates the scalar ﬁeld is given by

2 +q ν2

4 + ρ2.

φ(ρ) =

1
√2

ln" ν +pν2 + 4ρ2
−ν +pν2 + 4ρ2# .

(41)

Now, we go to the Euclidean time t → iτ , and for the Euclidean metric associated with
(39), Maxwell equation (13) yields

A′t(ρ)
N(ρ)

dL(F 2)
dF 2 = −

˜Q
ρ2 ,

(42)

where here and in the following the prime ′ denotes a derivative with respect to ρ. So, to

apply the Euclidean formalism we consider the following action:

IE = −

4π Z ∞

ρ+

(N(ρ)H(ρ) + AtP′) dρ + B ,

(43)

14

where

H(ρ) =

g(ρ)2φ′2 + V (φ)(cid:19) − L(F 2) −

P(ρ) = −

4A′t(ρ)ρ2

N(ρ)

dL(F 2)

,

(45)

which satisﬁes P′(ρ) = 0. By using Maxwell equation (42) we can show that P(ρ) = 4 ˜Q
is a constant. Furthermore, B is a surface term, β = 1/T is the period of Euclidean time

and ﬁnally Ω is the area of the spatial 2 section. We now compute the action when the

ﬁeld equations hold. The condition that the permitted geometries should not have conical

singularities at the event horizon ρ+ imposes

T =

N(ρ+) (g(ρ+)2)′

4π

.

(46)

So, by using the grand canonical ensemble we can ﬁx the temperature and the electric
potential Φ = −At(ρ+). Then, the variation of the surface term yields

δB = δBG + δBφ + δBF ,

where

δBF = βΩAt(ρ)δP(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

∞

.

For the variation of the ﬁelds at large distances we must be careful with the integral

appearing in the metric function (15).

It can be shown numerically that when At tends

to zero at inﬁnity (for 1/2 < p < 3/2 in power-law electrodynamics and in Born-Infeld

electrodynamics) the integral does not contribute to the conserved charges, and the variation

of the ﬁelds at large distances yields

δBG∞ = βΩ(cid:18)−

+ O(cid:18) 1
δBF∞ = βΩAt(∞)δP .

6

ρ(cid:19)(cid:19) δν ,

(52)

(53)

On the other hand, when the electric potential diverges at inﬁnity (for p > 3/2 in power-

law electrodynamics) the variation of the integral in the metric function (15) diverges too.

However, it can be veriﬁed numerically that it cancels out exactly with the contribution
coming from δBF∞ = βΩAt(∞)δP. So, we can have well deﬁned conserved charges in that
cases.

The variation of the ﬁelds at the horizon yields

δBGρ+ = −

4π

N(ρ)β

δρ+ ,

δBφρ+ = 0 ,

δBF ρ+ = βΩAt(ρ+)δP .

Therefore

δB = −

βΩ
3

α2δν3 + 2πΩδρ2

+ + βΩΦδP .

(54)

(55)

(56)

(57)

Thus, as the Euclidean action is related to the free energy F through IE = −βF we obtain

IE = S − βM + βΦQ .

(58)

Then, this relation makes it possible to identify the mass (M), the entropy (S) and the
electric charge (Q) as

M =

Ω
3

α2ν3 , S =

Ω
4G

+ ,Q = ΩP = 4Ω ˜Q .
ρ2

Thus, for power-law electrodynamics the electric charge is given by

Q(1) = 4Ωη2p−1pα(2p−1)/2p

1

ν2 ,

and for the Born-Infeld electrodynamics the electric charge is

Q(2) = 4Ωα1ν2 .

(59)

(60)

(61)

Having the temperature, mass, entropy and electric charge it is possible to study phase

transitions between the nonlinearly charged black holes with scalar hair and nonlinearly

16

charged black holes without hair. For this analysis it is convenient to write the temperature
of four-dimensional charged black holes with scalar hair (with k = −1) as

T =

(62)

On the other hand, in the absence of a scalar ﬁeld, the ﬁeld equations have as a solution

topological nonlinearly charged black holes, which correspond to the metric presented in Eq.

(15) of Ref.

[51] by setting the parameter α = 0 and n = 3. The non-hairy black hole we

consider here is also a generalization of the metric considered in [50], where a thermodynamic

study of spherically symmetric black holes charged with power-law electrodynamics but with

no cosmological constant was performed. The temperature, entropy, mass and electric charge

are given respectively by

TBH =

.

So, the horizon radius ρ+ can be written as a function of the temperature and of the electric

potential. Now, in order to ﬁnd phase transitions, we must consider both black holes in the

same grand canonical ensemble, i.e., at the same T and Φ. Making T and Φ equal for both

black holes and by considering the free energy F

F = F (T, Φ) = M − T S − ΦQ ,

(65)

we plot the diﬀerence of the free energies for the nonlinearly charged black hole (F1) and
the nonlinearly charged black hole with scalar hair (F0), ∆F = F1 − F0 as a function of the
temperature in Fig. 9. In that ﬁgure we show that there is a second-order phase transition
at the ﬁxed critical temperature Tc ≈ 0.16 for diﬀerent values of p, and the topological

17

nonlinearly charged hairy black hole dominates for temperatures lower than the critical,

whereas for temperatures higher than the critical the topological nonlinearly charged black
hole is thermodynamically preferred. It is worth mentioning that since ν and ˜Q are related,

the temperature and the electric potential are not independent; thus, we can express the free

energy as a function of T or Φ only. This is similar to what happens in [63] for a charged

hairy black hole in a linear electrodynamic.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have considered a gravitating system consisting of a scalar ﬁeld minimally coupled

to gravity with a self-interacting potential and a U(1) nonlinear electromagnetic ﬁeld. We

solved the coupled ﬁeld equations with a proﬁle of the scalar ﬁeld which falls suﬃciently fast

outside the black hole horizon. For a range of values of the scalar ﬁeld parameter, which

characterizes its behavior, we found numerically charged hairy black hole solutions in power-

law and Born-Infeld electrodynamics, with the scalar ﬁeld regular everywhere outside and

on the event horizon. Also, in the case of power-law electrodynamics, we found analytical

hairy black hole solutions for some special values of the exponent p in the range 1/2 < p < 1.

Then, we studied the thermodynamics for both electrodynamics and phase transitions of our

black hole solutions in power-law electrodynamics, and we showed that there is a second-

order phase transition. Moreover, at a low temperature, the topological nonlinearly charged

18

hairy black hole is thermodynamically preferred, whereas the topological charged black

hole without scalar hair is thermodynamically preferred at a high temperature for power-

law electrodynamics. Interestingly enough, these phase transitions occur at a ﬁxed critical

temperature and do not depend on the exponent p of the nonlinearity electrodynamics.

This picture is consistent with the ﬁndings of the application of the AdS/CFT corre-

spondence to condensed matter systems. In these systems there is a critical temperature

below which the system undergoes a phase transition to a hairy black hole conﬁguration

at a low temperature. This corresponds in the boundary ﬁeld theory to the formation of a

condensation of the scalar ﬁeld.
