SCHREIEDER’S SURFACES ARE ELLIPTIC MODULAR

LAURE FLAPAN

Abstract. We consider algebraic surfaces, recently constructed by Schreieder, which are smooth
models of the quotient of the self-product of a complex hyperelliptic curve by a Z/3cZ-action. We
show that these surfaces are elliptic modular surfaces attached to a particular subgroup of index
6· 3c in SL(2, Z). In particular, this implies that Schreieder’s surfaces are extremal elliptic surfaces,
meaning they have maximal Picard rank and Mordell-Weil rank 0.
In fact, we show they have
Mordell-Weil group Z/4Z.

1. Introduction

For any c ≥ 1 we consider a complex hyperelliptic curve Cg of genus g = 3c−1

, equipped with a
Z/3cZ-action. We may then equip the product Cg × Cg with a Z/3cZ-action. In [17], Schreieder
constructs smooth complex projective surfaces Xc as smooth models of the quotient of Cg × Cg by
this Z/3cZ-action.

2

These surfaces have irregularity q = 0 and geometric genus pg = g. Moreover, the subspace
H 1,1(Xc) of H 2(Xc, C) is generated by algebraic classes, so these surfaces Xc satisfy the Hodge
Conjecture and have maximal Picard rank. Schreieder’s surfaces Xc thus give examples of surfaces
with arbitrarily large geometric genus having maximal Picard number. This adds to the recent
examples of Picard-maximal surfaces given by Beauville in [2] and Arapura-Solapurkar in [1].

Additionally, Schreieder’s surfaces Xc come equipped with an automorphism φc of order 3c that
ﬁxes the elements of H 1,1(Xc). Because all the elements of H 1,1(Xc) are algebraic, the transcen-
dental part of H 2(Xc, Q) is a Q-Hodge structure. The automorphism φc induces an endomorphism
of this Hodge structure, which implies that this Hodge structure is of CM type.

For c = 1, the surface X1 has been studied rather extensively. In particular, Shioda and Inose
show in [19, Lemma 5.1] that X1 is a K3 surface and they study the elliptic ﬁbration of X1 induced
by the projection C1 × C1 → C1 onto the ﬁrst factor. They show that this ﬁbration has Mordell-
Weil group Z/3Z. Additionally, Cynk and Hulek prove in [7, Theorem 3.3] that the surface X1 is
modular.
Therefore, for the purposes of this paper, we investigate the geometry of the surfaces Xc for
c ≥ 2. A careful study of the Iitaka ﬁbration of these surfaces leads to the following main result.
For a particular non-congruence subgroup Γc of index 6 · 3c in SL(2, Z) we have:
Theorem 9.2. For c ≥ 2, the surface Xc is the elliptic modular surface attached to Γc.

In particular, we show that the surfaces Xc are elliptic surfaces ﬁbered over P1 and that they are
extremal, meaning that they have both maximal Picard number and Mordell-Weil group of rank
0. We investigate the ﬁbration f : Xc → P1 in detail, determining its singular ﬁbers precisely, in
order to show it has Mordell-Weil group isomorphic to the cyclic group Z/4Z.

1.1. Organization. The organization of the paper is as follows.

In Section 2, we present the details of the construction of the surfaces Xc. Section 3 consists
of the calculation that the surfaces Xc have Kodaira dimension 1. In Section 4, we show that the
Iitaka ﬁbration of these surfaces has base P1. Then Section 5 contains a careful study of the elliptic

ﬁbration f : Xc → P1 induced by the Iitaka ﬁbration of Xc. In Section 6 we show that f : Xc → P1
is an extremal elliptic surface. In Section 7 we prove that f : Xc → P1 has Mordell-Weil group
Z/4Z. Section 8 examines the j-invariant of f : Xc → P1. Finally Section 9 proves that the surface
Xc is, in fact, an elliptic modular surface.

2. Construction of Xc

We begin by presenting the details of the construction of the surface Xc.
For a ﬁxed c ≥ 2 consider the complex hyperelliptic curve Cg of genus g = 3c−1

given by a

2

smooth projective model of the aﬃne curve

{y2 = x2g+1 + 1}.

The curve Cg is obtained from this aﬃne curve by adding a point at ∞, which is covered by an
aﬃne piece

{v2 = u2g+2 + u},

where x = u−1 and y = v · u−g−1.

Consider the automorphism ψg on Cg of order 3c given by, for ζ a primitive 3c-th root of unity,

(x, y) (cid:55)→ (ζ · x, y)

(u, v) (cid:55)→ (ζ−1 · u, ζ gv)

Then, consider the product Cg × Cg and the automorphism of Cg × Cg given by ψ−1

the surface Xc to be the minimal resolution of the quotient (Cg × Cg)/(cid:104)ψ−1
given by {y2 = x2g+1 + 1} we have two ﬁxed points:

Observe that the ﬁxed set of the action of ψg on Cg consists of 3 points. In the coordinate patch

g × ψg. Deﬁne

g × ψg(cid:105).

In the coordinate patch given by {v2 = u2g+2 + u}, we have a third ﬁxed point:

P1 : (x, y) = (0, 1) and P2 : (x, y) = (0,−1).

Q : (u, v) = (0, 0).

g × ψg on Cg × Cg is 9 points consisting of pairs of points taken from the
g × ψg(cid:105) by resolving these 9

Hence, the ﬁxed set of ψ−1
set {P1, P2, Q}. The surface Xc is then obtained from (Cg × Cg)/(cid:104)ψ−1
singular points.
Now using the Implicit Function Theorem one may verify that the coordinate x is a local coor-
dinate in the coordinate patch on Cg given by {y2 = x2g+1 + 1} and the coordinate v is a local
coordinate in the coordinate patch on Cg given by {v2 = u2g+2 + u}. Hence ψg acts with weight 1
around P1 and P2 and acts with weight g around Q.
g × ψg on Cg × Cg has weights (−1, 1) around ﬁxed points of the
form (Pi, Pj), weights (−1, g) around ﬁxed points of the form (Pi, Q), weights (−g, 1) around ﬁxed
points of the form (Q, Pi), and weights (−g, g) around the ﬁxed point (Q, Q).
g × ψg has weights (−1, 1) or (−g, g) the Type I ﬁxed
points of Cg × Cg and the 4 ﬁxed points on which ψ−1
g × ψg has weights (−1, g) or (−g, 1) the Type
II ﬁxed points of Cg × Cg.

We will call the 5 ﬁxed points on which ψ−1

Thus the Z/3cZ-action of ψ−1

3. The Kodaira Dimension of Xc is 1

V

For a smooth algebraic variety V and any m > 0, the m-th plurigenus of V is given by Pm =
h0(V, K⊗m
). The Kodaira dimension κ of V is −∞ if Pm = 0 for all m > 0 and otherwise it is the
minimum κ such that Pm/mκ is bounded. If V has dimension d, then the Kodaira dimension of V
is either −∞ or an integer 0 ≤ κ ≤ d.
Now Kodaira dimension is a birational invariant. Therefore we may compute the Kodaira di-
g × ψg(cid:105).
mension of Xc by computing the Kodaira dimension of any smooth model of (Cg × Cg)/(cid:104)ψ−1
In fact, we compute the Kodaira dimension of the smooth model Yc, constructed by Schreieder in
[17, Section 8] and detailed below.

3.1. Construction of Yc. Consider the group

H := (cid:104)ψ−1

g × id, id × ψg(cid:105) ⊂ Aut(Cg × Cg)

Now for each i = 1, . . . , c deﬁne the element of order 3i in H:

ηi := (ψ−1

g × ψg)3c−i

The element ηi generates a cyclic subgroup Gi := (cid:104)ηi(cid:105) ⊂ H, which gives a ﬁltration:

0 = G0 ⊂ G1 ⊂ ··· ⊂ Gc = (cid:104)ψ−1
such that each quotient Gi/Gi−1 is cyclic of order 3. Now, let

g × ψg(cid:105)

Y0 = Cg × Cg,
Y (cid:48)
0 = Blow up of Y0 along FixY0(η1),
Y (cid:48)(cid:48)
0 = Blow up of Y (cid:48)
(η1),

0 along FixY (cid:48)

0

observing that since H restricts to an action on FixY0(η1), the action of H on Y0 lifts to an action
on Y (cid:48)

0 and then similarly to an action on Y (cid:48)(cid:48)
0 .
Now inductively deﬁne for i ∈ {1, . . . , c}:
i−1/(cid:104)ηi(cid:105),

Yi = Y (cid:48)(cid:48)
Y (cid:48)
i = Blow up of Yi along FixYi(ηi+1),
Y (cid:48)(cid:48)
i = Blow up of Y (cid:48)
(ηi+1),

i along FixY (cid:48)

i

where, by abuse of notation, we let (cid:104)ηi(cid:105) denote the subgroup of Aut(Y (cid:48)(cid:48)
of ηi ∈ H. Namely we have the following diagram:

where each arrow to the left corresponds to a sequence of two blow-up maps and each arrow to
i /(cid:104)ηi+1(cid:105) is then a smooth model of
the right corresponds to a 3 : 1 cover. Each quotient Yi+1 = Y (cid:48)(cid:48)
Y0/Gi+1. Namely, Yc is the desired smooth model of (Cg × Cg)/Gc.
So, in order to compute the Kodaira dimension of Xc, we will in fact compute the Kodaira
dimension of Yc. Namely, we are interested in the plurigenera Pm = h0(Yc, K⊗m
) for m > 0. To
compute these Pm, we will use information about the canonical bundle of Cg × Cg together with
the explicit construction of Yc detailed above. Hence, we begin by establishing how the vanishing
of forms changes under blow-ups and quotients.

For an algebraic surface V with a coordinate patch (z1, z2) having the standard action of G2
on C2, we say that a form ω is toric on the patch (z1, z2) if the divisor of zeros of ω on (z1, z2) is
invariant under the action of G2

3.4. Kodaira Dimension Computation for Xc.
Theorem 3.2. For c ≥ 2, the surface Xc has Kodaira dimension 1.
Proof. Let σ be a global section of K⊗m
(Q, P1) and with vanishing sequence (β1, β2) on the ηc-ﬁxed point (P1, Q).
Thus ηc acts locally on the preimage E(cid:48)

with vanishing sequence (α1, α2) on the ηc-ﬁxed point
Now, as discussed in Section 2, the automorphism ηc acts with weights (−g, 1) around (Q, P1).

∼= W (cid:48)(cid:48)

Now observe that ηc acts with weights (−g, 0) on W1, meaning the ﬁxed locus of the action of
ηc on W1 is all of Z1. But Z1 has codimension 1 in Y1. Hence, locally on W1, the blow up maps

weights (−g, 0) and this action has ﬁxed locus Z2.

We now make use of the following theorem of K¨ock and Tait:

we consider global sections of K⊗m
where 0 ≤ a ≤ (m − 1)(g − 1) − 2.

Observe that for the purposes of computing Kodaira dimension, we may assume m > 1. Thus
of the form xaω, where 0 ≤ a ≤ m(g − 1) or of the form xayω,
Begin by considering the aﬃne patch of Cg given by {y2 = x2g+1 + 1}. We know the variable x

Cg

is a local coordinate for Cg at the points P1 and P2. Since we have

ω =

dx⊗m
ym ,

the form ω has order of vanishing equal to 0 at P1 and P2. Hence both forms xaω and xayω have
order of vanishing a at ﬁxed points P1 and P2.
In (u, v)-coordinates, the form ω is given by:

(−1)dum(g−1)du⊗m

Recall that v is a local coordinate near the point Q. The equation v2 = u2g+2 + u yields 2v · dv =
((2g + 2)u2g+1 + 1) · du. Namely, du and v vanish to the same order. Moreover, u has order of
vanishing 2 with respect to v, hence the order of vanishing of ω at the point Q is 2m(g − 1), which
is equal to 3m(3c−1 − 1).

Hence a form xaω = u−aω has order of vanishing at Q given by:

vm

3m(3c−1) − 2a

and a form xayω = u−(a+g+1)vω has order of vanishing at Q given by:

2m(g − 1) − 2(a + g + 1) + 1 = 3m(3c−1) − 2a − 3c.

sion of Xc is exactly equal to 1.

4. The Base of the Iitaka Fibration of Xc

By Theorem 3.2, the surface Xc has Kodaira dimension 1. Let P(H 0(Xc, K⊗m
Xc
). Then the image of the Iitaka ﬁbration of Xc

of hyperplanes in H 0(Xc, K⊗m

given by sending a point x to its evaluation on a basis of global sections of K⊗m
divisible (see [13, Theorem 2.1.33]), is a curve. We wish to identify exactly what this curve is.
Proposition 4.1. For c ≥ 2, the base of the Iitaka ﬁbration of the surface Xc is P1.

In order to identify the base of the Iitaka ﬁbration of Xc, we then only need to determine the

Now from the proof of Theorem 3.2, global sections of K⊗m
of the form:

where t = x1(z1)x2(z2). Since the base of the Iitaka ﬁbration of Xc is necessarily a normal projective
(cid:3)
variety [13, Theorem 2.1.33], the image of f must be isomorphic to P1.
5. The Elliptic Fibration f : Xc → P1

From Theorem 3.2 and Proposition 4.1, the Iitaka ﬁbration f : Xc → P1 makes Xc into an
elliptic surface. Namely, the general ﬁber of f is an elliptic curve. One may ﬁnd many of the basic
properties of elliptic surfaces in the surveys [14] and [18].
In order to understand the geometry of the elliptic surface f : Xc → P1, it will be necessary to
g × ψg(cid:105). To do this, we will make
understand the resolutions of the singular points in (Cg × Cg)/(cid:104)ψ−1
use of established facts about surface cyclic quotient singularities and Hirzebruch-Jung resolutions.
A brief survey of these can be found in [12, Section 2.4] and a more detailed explanation can be
found in [16].
5.0.1. Surface Cyclic Quotient Singularities and Xc. Consider the action of the cyclic group Z/rZ

(z1, z2) (cid:55)→ (z1, az2),

for some a coprime to r, where  is a primitive r-th root of unity. We denote this action by:

The Hirzebruch-Jung expansion of r

Then the minimal resolution of the singularity C2/ 1

Recall from Section 2 that Cg × Cg has 9 ﬁxed points under the action of ψ−1

r (1, a) consists of a chain of s + 1 excep-
tional curves E0, E1, . . . , Es with nonzero intersection numbers Ei.Ei = −bi and Ei.Ei+1 = 1 [12,
Proposition 2.32].
g × ψg: ﬁve Type
I ﬁxed points of the form (Pi, Pj) or (Q, Q) and four Type II ﬁxed points of the form (Pi, Q) or
g × ψg locally acts on the Type I ﬁxed points with weights (−1, 1)
(Q, Pi). The automorphism ψ−1
on points (Pi, Pj) and with weights (−g, g) on the point (Q, Q). It locally acts on the Type II ﬁxed
points with weights (−1, g) on points (Pi, Q) and with weights (−g, 1) on points (Q, Pi).
g × ψg(cid:105), meaning those points corresponding
to Type I ﬁxed points of Cg × Cg under the action of ψ−1
g × ψg, have Hirzebruch-Jung expansion:
(cid:125)
[2 : ··· : 2]
(3c−1)−times
Namely the Type I singular points of Cg × Cg/(cid:104)ψ−1
g × ψg(cid:105) are DuVal singularities of type A3c−1.
In other words, the minimal resolution of each Type I singular point consists of a chain of 3c − 1
rational curves, each with self-intersection −2.

Hence, the Type I singular points of (Cg × Cg)/(cid:104)ψ−1

(cid:123)(cid:122)

.

The Type II singular points of (Cg × Cg)/(cid:104)ψ−1

g × ψg(cid:105) have Hirzebruch-Jung expansion:

[2, g + 1].

Hence the minimal resolution of each Type II singular point consists of a chain of two rational
curves, one with self-intersection −2 and one with self-intersection −(g + 1).
5.0.2. Singular Fibers of f : Xc → P1. We now study in detail the geometry of the elliptic ﬁbration
f : Xc → P1.
In particular, we extensively use Kodaira’s classiﬁcation, in [10] and [11], of the
possible singular ﬁbers of an elliptic surface. For a survey of the possible ﬁber types, see [14, I.4]
and [18, Section 4].
As we will see, the two kinds of singular ﬁbers that appear here are the singular ﬁbers of type
b for b ≥ 0. Singular ﬁbers of type Ib consist of b smooth
Ib for b > 0 and singular ﬁbers of type I∗
rational curves meeting in a cycle, namely meeting with dual graph the aﬃne Dynkin diagram ˜Ab.
Singular ﬁbers of type I∗
b consist of b + 5 smooth rational curves meeting with dual graph the aﬃne
Dynkin diagram ˜Db+4.
Theorem 5.1. For c ≥ 2, the elliptic surface f : Xc → P1 has 3c + 2 singular ﬁbers: one of type
3c located at ∞, and the remaining 3c of type I1 and located at the
I4·3c located at 0, one of type I∗
points ζ i, for ζ a primitive 3c-th root of unity.

Proof. We consider again the diagram

From the proof of Theorem 3.2, global sections of K⊗m

correspond to global sections of K⊗m

Cg×Cg

Xc

of the form:

for 0 ≤ a ≤ m(g − 1). Thus we may view the map α : Cg × Cg (cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) P(H 0(Xc, K⊗m
map sending:

Xc

)) as the rational

(z1, z2) (cid:55)→ [s0(z1, z2) : ··· : sm(g−1)(z1, z2)].

Hence we have:
(17)

α−1([1 : 0 : ··· : 0]) =(P1 × (Cg − Q)) ∪ (P2 × (Cg − Q)) ∪ ((Cg − Q) × P1) ∪ ((Cg − Q) × P2)
α−1([0 : ··· : 0 : 1]) =(Q × Q) ∪ (Q × (Cg − P1 − P2)) ∪ ((Cg − P1 − P2) × Q).
Consider the ﬁxed points in Cg × Cg of the form (Pi, Pj). By (17), we know that the image under

α of these points is the point [1 : 0 : ··· : 0] in P(H 0(Xc, K⊗m
As established in Section 5.0.1, the points (Pi, Pj) are DuVal singularities of type A3c−1 under
g × ψg. Thus the resolution of each such point consists of a chain of 3c−1 rational
the action of ψ−1
curves of self-intersection −2. By the diagram (13), for each such point (Pi, Pj), all of these 3c−1
rational curves in Xc must get mapped to the point [1 : 0 : ··· : 0] by the ﬁbration f : Xc →
P(H 0(Xc, K⊗m

)).

)).

Xc

Moreover, by (13) in conjunction with (17), since f is a morphism we must have that the strict

Xc

transforms in Xc of the curves

P1 × Cg, P2 × Cg, Cg × P1, and Cg × P2

also get sent to [1 : 0 : ··· : 0]. Note that the strict transform of Cg × Pj will intersect the chain of
rational curves resolving the singularity Pi × Pj at one end of the chain and the strict transform of
Pi × Cg will intersect the chain at the other end of the chain.
Now, consider the ﬁxed point (Q, Q) in Cg × Cg. It gets sent to the point [0 : ··· : 0 : 1] by α.
As established in Section 5.0.1, the point (Q, Q) is also a DuVal singularity of type A3c−1 under
g × ψg. Thus the resolution of (Q, Q) consists of a chain of 3c−1 rational curves of
the action of ψ−1
self-intersection −2. So, all of these 3c−1 rational curves in X get mapped to the point [0 : ··· : 0 : 1]
by the ﬁbration f : Xc → P(H 0(Xc, K⊗m

)).

Moreover, again by (13) in conjunction with (17), since f is a morphism we must have that the

Xc

strict transforms in X of the curves

Q × Cg and Cg × Q

get sent to [0 : ··· : 0 : 1] as well. Again, the strict transform of Q × Cg will intersect the chain of
rational curves resolving the singularity (Q, Q) at one end and the strict transform of Cg × Q will
intersect the chain at the other end.

So f sends the strict transforms in Xc of the curves

P1 × Cg, P2 × Cg, Cg × P1, and Cg × P2

(18)
to [1 : 0 : ··· : 0] and the strict transforms of the curves
(19)
to [0 : ··· : 0 : 1]. Each of the four Type II ﬁxed points in Cg × Cg, namely those of the form
either Q × Pi or Pi × Q, has two of the curves in (18) and (19) passing through it. Observe that
these four Type II ﬁxed points are exactly the points on which the rational map α : Cg × Cg (cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75)
P(H 0(Xc, K⊗m

Q × Cg and Cg × Q

)) is not deﬁned.

LAURE FLAPAN

Now, as established in Section 5.0.1, these Type II singular points have minimal resolution con-
sisting of a chain of two rational curves, one with self-intersection −2 and one with self-intersection
−(g + 1). Observe that for a Type II point of the form Q × Pi, the strict transform in Xc of
the curve Q × Cg will intersect this chain of rational curves at the end of the (−2)-curve and the
strict transform of the curve Cg × Pi will intersect the chain of rational curves at the end of the
−(g + 1)-curve.
By the adjunction formula, the irreducible curves on Xc contained in a ﬁber of f : Xc → P1 ⊂
P(H 0(Xc, K⊗m
)) are exactly those curves F ⊂ Xc with KXc.F = 0. So, of the two curves in the
resolution of a Type II singular point, the curve with self-intersection −2 gets mapped to a point
by f and the curve with self-intersection −(g + 1) gets mapped to all of P1 by f .
Since the (−2)-curve in the resolution of each Type II singular point intersects either the curve
Q × Cg or the curve Cg × Q, both of which get sent to the point [0 : ··· : 0 : 1] by α, we have that
f sends these (−2)-curves in the resolutions of the Type II singular points to [0 : ··· : 0 : 1] as well.
So we have accounted for all of the curves in the resolutions of the singular points of (Cg ×
Cg)/(cid:104)ψ−1
)) is a
cycle consisting of the four sets of 3c − 1 rational curves coming from the resolutions of the points
Pi × Pj together with the four curves in (18). Namely, the ﬁber under f of [1 : 0 : ··· : 0] consists of

g × ψg(cid:105). In summary, the ﬁber in Xc of the point [1 : 0 : ··· : 0] in P(H 0(Xc, K⊗m

Xc

Xc

4(3c − 1) + 4 = 4 · 3c

rational curves. This is a ﬁber of type I4·3c in Kodaira’s classiﬁcation of the singular ﬁbers of an
elliptic surface.
Similarly, the ﬁber in Xc of the point [0 : ··· : 0 : 1] consists of the 3c − 1 rational curves
resolving the singularity Q × Q together with the curves in (19) and the four (−2)-curves, each
from a resolution of a Type II point. Namely, the ﬁber under f of [0 : ··· : 0 : 1] consists of a
chain of 3c + 1 rational curves, where each curve on the ends of the chain has two additional curves
coming oﬀ it. This is a ﬁber of type I∗
3c.
We now want to identify the singular ﬁbers of f away from the points 0 and ∞ in P1. Namely

we would like to understand the map

f : Xc → P1 ⊂ P(H 0(Xc, K⊗m

Xc

))

away from any points on which a global section of K⊗m
understand the singular ﬁbers of the map

Xc

vanishes. To do this, we would like to

α : Cg × Cg (cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) P(H 0(Xc, K⊗m

))

Xc

on the open subset of Cg × Cg away from the 9 ﬁxed points of the (ψ−1
in Proposition 4.1, on this open subset, the map α may then be thought of as the map:

g × ψg)-action. As discussed

where t = x1(z1)x2(z2). The ﬁbers of α on this subset are then the curves Ft ⊂ Cg × Cg deﬁned
by:

(z1, z2) (cid:55)→ (t, t2, . . . , tm(g−1)),

where we are assuming t (cid:54)= 0. Such curves Ft have Jacobian:

Hence the ﬁber Ft is singular when y1 = y2 = 0. When this is the case, then we have x1 = ζ i,
x2 = ζ j, and t = ζ i+j, for some i and j, where ζ is a primitive 3c-th root of unity.

SCHREIEDER’S SURFACES ARE ELLIPTIC MODULAR

13

In other words, if t ∈ C∗ is any 3c-th root of unity, then the ﬁber Ft is singular and has

singularities at the points

such that i + j ≡ 0 mod 3c. Namely, the curve Ft has 3c singular points.

Since the action of ψ−1

g × ψg permutes these 3c singular points, the image ¯Ft of Ft in X is a curve

with a single singularity. So ¯Ft is then an irreducible singular ﬁber of the ﬁbration

(x1, y1, x2, y2) = (ζ i, 0, ζ j, 0)

f : Xc → P1 ⊂ P(H 0(Xc, K⊗m

)).

Xc

By Kodaira’s classiﬁcation of the singular ﬁbers of an elliptic surface, the ﬁber ¯Ft must, in fact, be
a rational nodal curve, namely a ﬁber of type I1.
Therefore, in summary, we have identiﬁed a singular ﬁber of type I4·3c at the point 0 in P1, we
3c at the point ∞, and we have identiﬁed 3c singular ﬁbers
have identiﬁed a singular ﬁber of type I∗
of type I1, located at the points ζ i.

We may conﬁrm that these are indeed all of the singular ﬁbers using the following description of
the topological Euler number of an elliptic surface in terms its singular ﬁbers. From [5, Proposition
5.16] we have that for a complex elliptic surface f : S → C with ﬁber Fv at v ∈ C having mv
components, we have

(cid:88)

v∈C

χtop(S) =

e(Fv),

if Fv is smooth
if Fv is of type In
otherwise.

mv

(20)

where

e(Fv) =

0

Now since the surface Xc has irregularity q = 0 and geometric genus pg = g, we have

χtop(Xc) = 12(g + 1) = 6 · 3c + 6.

Considering the ﬁbration f : Xc → P1, the 4 · 3c components from the singular ﬁber of type
I4·3c, the 3c + 5 components from the singular ﬁber of type I∗
3c, and the 3c components from the
3c singular ﬁbers of type I1 account for exactly 6 · 3c + 6 on the right hand side of Equation (20).
Thus, we have veriﬁed that we indeed have identiﬁed all the singular ﬁbers of the elliptic surface
(cid:3)
Xc.

6. The Surface Xc is Extremal

The Mordell-Weil group of an elliptic surface f : S → C is the group of K-rational points on the
generic ﬁber of f , where K = C(C). Such an elliptic surface S is called extremal if it has maximal
Picard rank ρ(S), meaning ρ(S) = h1,1(S), and if it has Mordell-Weil rank r = 0.
Corollary 6.1. The surface f : Xc → P1 is an extremal elliptic surface.
Proof. Following the notation in [18], for the ﬁbration f : Xc → P1 and for any v ∈ P1, let Fv
denote the ﬁber f−1(v). Let mv denote the number of components of Fv and let R denote the
points of P1 underneath reducible ﬁbers. Namely, we have

R = {v ∈ P1 | Fv is reducible}.

The Shioda-Tate formula [18, Corollary 6.13] gives the Picard number ρ(Xc) in terms of both the
reducible singular ﬁbers of f : Xc → P1 and the rank r of the Mordell-Weil group:
(21)

(mv − 1) + r.

ρ(Xc) = 2 +

(cid:88)

v∈R

14

LAURE FLAPAN

From Theorem 5.1, the elliptic ﬁbration f : Xc → P1 has two reducible singular ﬁbers: one of type
(cid:88)
3c at ∞. These have 4 · 3c and 3c + 5 components respectively. Hence
I4·3c at 0 and one of type I∗
we have:

(mv − 1) = (4 · 3c − 1) + (3c + 4)

v∈R

So then Equation (21) becomes:

= 5 · 3c + 3.

ρ(Xc) = 5 · 3c + 5 + r.

However we know the Picard number ρ(Xc) of Xc satisﬁes ρ(Xc) ≤ h1,1(Xc).
For an elliptic surface S of geometric genus p ﬁbered over a base curve C of genus q, we have
h1,1 = 10p − 8q + 10 [18, Section 6.10]. Hence, in the case of the surface Xc we have h1,1(Xc) =
10(g + 1) = 5 · 3c + 5. Therefore r = 0 and ρ(Xc) = h1,1(X).
(cid:3)

7. The Mordell-Weil Group of Xc is Z/4Z

Since the Mordell-Weil group of the elliptic ﬁbration f : Xc → P1 is the group of C(P1)-rational
points on the generic ﬁber of f , elements of the Mordell-Weil group determine sections P1 → Xc and
so may be viewed as curves in Xc. In order to determine the Mordell-Weil group of f : Xc → P1,
we thus would like to understand the sections of f as curves in Xc.
g × ψg on Cg × Cg has 9 ﬁxed points: 5 of Type I, meaning of the
form (Pi, Pj) or (Q, Q), and 4 of Type II, meaning of the form (Pi, Q) or (Q, Pi). Let us denote
these four Type II points by:

Recall that the action of ψ−1

δ1 = Q × P1, δ2 = Q × P2, δ3 = P1 × Q, δ4 = P2 × Q.

We have seen in the proof of Theorem 5.1 that the images in Xc of the points δi consist of two
rational curves: one with self-intersection −2 and one with self-intersection −(g + 1). Let us denote
the −(g + 1)-curves corresponding to δ1, δ2, δ3, and δ4, respectively, by:

C1, C2, C3, and C4.

Then we have the following:
Proposition 7.1. For c ≥ 2, the elliptic ﬁbration f : Xc → P1 has exactly four sections. Viewed
as curves in Xc, these sections correspond exactly to the curves C1, C2, C3, and C4.
Proof. By Corollary 6.1, the Mordell-Weil group of f : Xc → P1 has rank 0. Namely, the ﬁbration
f : X → P1 has only ﬁnitely many sections.
Now suppose we have a section s : P1 → Xc of f . Let us view s as a curve s in Xc. So s is a
rational curve sitting inside of Xc.
If s is not one of the rational curves introduced in resolving the singular points of (Cg×Cg)/(cid:104)ψ−1
g ×
ψg(cid:105), then s is isomorphic to a curve ˜s in (Cg × Cg)/(cid:104)ψ−1
g × ψg(cid:105). Moreover, since s corresponds to
a section of f , the curve s intersects the ﬁber F0 = f−1(0) exactly once and intersects the ﬁber
F∞ = f−1(∞) exactly once. Hence the preimage ˆs of ˜s in Cg × Cg has at most two points ﬁxed by
the action of ψ−1

g × ψg. Since ˜s has genus 0, the Riemann-Hurwitz formula yields:

2g(ˆs) − 2 = 3c(−2) + (3c − 1)(l) for 0 ≤ l ≤ 2.

Simplifying using the bounds on l yields:

g(ˆs) ≤ 1.

Namely, we have a morphism ˆs → Cg × Cg, where ˆs has genus less than or equal to 1. However
this is impossible since any such morphism can be composed with the projection map to get a
morphism ˆs → Cg, which cannot exist since Cg has genus g ≥ 4. Hence we have shown that any

SCHREIEDER’S SURFACES ARE ELLIPTIC MODULAR

15

g × ψg(cid:105).

section s : P1 → Xc must correspond to one of the rational curves introduced in resolving the
singular points of (Cg × Cg)/(cid:104)ψ−1
Moreover, using the canonical bundle formula for an elliptic surface, any section s : P1 → Xc
considered as a curve in Xc must have self-intersection given by the negative of the geometric Euler
characteristic −χ(Xc) = −(g + 1) [18, Corollary 6.9].
However, we have established in the proof of Theorem 5.1 that all of the curves in the resolution
g × ψg(cid:105) have self-intersection −2 except for the four curves
of the singular points of (Cg × Cg)/(cid:104)ψ−1
C1, C2, C3, and C4 coming from the resolution of the Type II ﬁxed points δ1, δ2, δ3, and δ4. It thus
remains only to verify that these four −(g + 1)-curves C1, C2, C3, and C4 indeed give sections of
f : Xc → P1.
Consider the point Q × Pi in Cg × Cg. As discussed in the proof of Theorem 3.2, the coordinate
v is a local coordinate for Cg near the point Q and the coordinate x is a local coordinate for Cg
g × ψg locally acts on the coordinate patch (v1, x2) around Q × Pi
near the points Pi. So then ψ−1
with weights (−g, 1). After blowing up the point Q × Pi, the automorphism ψ−1
g × ψg locally acts
with weights:

(−g, g + 1) and (g, 1)

Explicitly, if the coordinates of the exceptional curve are [w1 : w2], then ψ−1

on the exceptional curve.
g × ψg acts on the
aﬃne patch having coordinates (v1, w2) with weights (−g, g + 1) and acts on the aﬃne patch having
coordinates (w1, x2) with weights (g, 1).
There are two ﬁxed points of this action, corresponding to the points at 0 and at ∞ on the
exceptional curve. Blowing up these two points yields local action by ψ−1
(−g, 0), (0, g + 1), (g, g + 2), and (−(g + 2), 1).

g × ψg having weights:

Thus observe that the exceptional curve E obtained from blowing up the point [w1 : w2] = [1 : 0]
g × ψg. Namely, the curve E is unaﬀected by all subsequent
is point-wise ﬁxed by the action of ψ−1
blow-ups and quotients involved in producing Yc from Cg × Cg, aside from the fact that each
Z/3Z-quotient multiplies the self-intersection number of E by 3. Hence the image of E in Yc has
self-intersection −3c = −(2g + 1).
One may verify that obtaining the minimal surface Xc from Yc requires g rounds of contracting
(−1)-curves in the chain of curves resolving Q × Pi. At each stage, a (−1)-curve lies adjacent to E
in the chain. This is how in the minimal resolution of Q × Pi, the image of E has self-intersection
−(g + 1).
Now, as discussed in the proof of Theorem 5.1, away from the points at 0 and at ∞ in P1, a ﬁber
¯Ft of the ﬁbration f : Xc → P1 may be viewed as the image in Xc of the curve Ft ⊂ Cg × Cg given
by:
As we approach the point Q × Pi, we would like to switch coordinates and view this curve Ft as
the curve given by:
Since we have local coordinates (v1, x2) near the point Q × Pi, very close to Q × Pi we may think
of Ft as being given simply by:
where γ(v1) is a continuous function in v1. Namely, very close to Q×Pi the curve Ft has coordinates
given by:
It follows that the slope of Ft as we approach the point Q × Pi given by (v1, x2) = (0, 0) is:

γ(v1)−1x2 = t,

(v1, x2) = (v1, tγ(v1)).

Hence the strict transform F (cid:48)

t of Ft in the blow-up at Q × Pi intersects the exceptional curve at
the point [w1 : w2] = [1 : 0]. Near this point, we have local coordinates (v1, w2), where x2 = v1w2.
So very close to the point [w1 : w2] = [1 : 0], also given by (v1, w2) = (0, 0), the strict transform F (cid:48)
is given by v1w2 = tγ(v1).
Hence the strict transform F (cid:48)(cid:48)

Namely, the curve F (cid:48)(cid:48)
in Xc intersects the image of E at the point with coordinate t.
So we have shown that a ﬁber ¯Ft of the ﬁbration f : Xc → P1 intersects the −(g + 1)-curves
C1 and C2 in each of the resolutions of the points δ1 = Q × P1 and δ2 = Q × P2 at the point on
Ci-curve with coordinate t. Symmetrically, the same also holds for the intersection of ¯Ft with the
−(g + 1)-curves C3 and C4 in each of the resolutions of the points δ3 = P1 × Q and δ4 = P2 × Q.
Hence for each i = 1, . . . , 4, the morphism si : P1 → Xc given by sending the point t to the point on
Ci with coordinate t deﬁnes a section of the ﬁbration f : Xc → P1. So we indeed have four sections
of f given by the curves C1, C2, C3, and C4.
(cid:3)
Corollary 7.2. For c ≥ 2, the Mordell-Weil group of f : Xc → P1 is isomorphic to Z/4Z.
Proof. From Proposition 7.1, the Mordell-Weil group of Xc has order 4, namely it must be either
the cyclic group Z/4Z or the group Z/2Z × Z/2Z. Viewed as curves in Xc, the elements of the
Mordell-Weil group correspond to the −(g + 1)-curves

C1, C2, C3, and C4

in the resolutions of the four Type II singular points

δ1 = Q × P1, δ2 = Q × P2, δ3 = P1 × Q, δ4 = P2 × Q

in Cg × Cg/(cid:104)ψ−1 × ψ(cid:105).
Recall from the proof of Theorem 5.1 that each resolution of a Type II singular point δi resulted
in two curves: the −(g + 1)-curve Ci and a (−2)-curve, which we denote by Ti. These curves Ti
form the outermost four components of the ﬁber of f of type I3c, which is located above ∞.

Now let

denote the strict transforms in Xc of the curves (respectively):

Cg × P1, Cg × P2, P1 × Cg, and P2 × Cg.

S1, S2, S3, and S4

Then, from the proof of Theorem 5.1, the curves Si all lie in the ﬁber of f of type I4·3c, which is
located above 0. Each curve Ci intersects the curve Si.
Now an elliptic surface f : S → C has a group structure on all of its ﬁbers, not just on its smooth
ﬁbers. The group elements in a singular ﬁber Fv are in correspondence with the components of
multiplicity 1 in Fv (see [14, VII.2.6]).
group structure G(Ib) ∼= Z/bZ. Singular ﬁbers of type I∗
corresponding to the four extremal components, and have group structure G(I∗

In particular, singular ﬁbers of type Ib have all their components of multiplicity 1 and have
b have 4 components of multiplicity 1,

For any such elliptic surface f : S → C, let R denote the set of reducible ﬁbers of f . Then
if M W (S) is the Mordell-Weil group of f : S → C, we have, see [18, Corollary 7.5], an injective
homomorphism

γ : M W (S)tors →(cid:88)

G(Fv),

v∈R

given by sending a section to the respective ﬁber components that it meets.

Namely, in the case of the elliptic surface f : Xc → P1, we have an injection

such that

Hence, we indeed have M W (Xc) ∼= Z/4Z.

γ(Ci) = (Si, Ti).

8. The j-Invariant of f : Xc → P1

Following Kodaira [10], for an elliptic surface f : S → C without multiple ﬁbers, let j : C (cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) P1
be the rational map such that for every P ∈ C such that f−1(P ) is nonsingular, we have j(P ) is
the j-invariant of the elliptic curve f−1(P ). This rational map j can in fact be extended to all of
C. The morphism j : C → P1 is called the j-invariant of the elliptic surface f : S → C. If P ∈ C
is such that f−1(P ) is singular, then we have the following (reproduced from [8]):

Lemma 8.1. For c ≥ 2, the j-invariant j : P1 → P1 of f : Xc → P1 is non-constant.
Proof. From Theorem 5.1, all of the singular ﬁbers of f : Xc → P1 are of type Ib or I∗
b with b > 0.
Hence the j-invariant of f : Xc → P1 satisﬁes j(P ) = ∞ for all P ∈ P1 such that f−1(P ) is singular.
However, since generically for P ∈ P1 the j-invariant j(P ) is the j-invariant of the elliptic curve
f−1(P ), generically j cannot be ∞. Thus j is non-constant.
(cid:3)
Proposition 8.2. For c ≥ 2, the j-invariant j : P1 → P1 of f : Xc → P1 has degree 6 · 3c and is
ramiﬁed at the points 0, 1728, and ∞. There are 2 · 3c branch points above 0, all of ramiﬁcation
index 3. There are 3 · 3c branch points above 1728, all of ramiﬁcation index 2. Finally, there are
2 branch points above ∞, one with ramiﬁcation index 4 · 3c corresponding to the point 0 ∈ P1 with
singular ﬁber under f of type I4·3c, and one with ramiﬁcation index 3c corresponding to the point
∞ ∈ P1 with singular ﬁber of type I3c.
Proof. This follows directly from results of Mangala Nori in [15]. Since f : Xc → P1 is extremal
with non-constant j-invariant, it follows from [15, Theorem 3.1] that j : P1 → P1 is ramiﬁed only
over the points 0, 1728, and ∞ and that we have:

So indeed the j-invariant of f : Xc → P1 has degree 6 · 3c. Now let

Moreover, because equality holds in (23), Nori’s proof in [15, Lemma 3.2] also implies that

deg(j) = 3|R0|.

Hence we have:

(25)
Now from [15, Theorem 3.1], for any v ∈ R0, we must have ev ≤ 3. Hence using (25),

|R0| = 2 · 3c.

R0 ≤ 4 · 3c.

But we have already shown that in fact equality holds, therefore we have ev = 3 for all v ∈ R0.
Theorem 3.1] also imply that ev = 2 for all v ∈ R1728.

Since Xc is extremal and f : Xc → P1 has no singular ﬁbers of type III∗, Nori’s results [15,

9. The Surface Xc is Elliptic Modular

We begin by giving a brief introduction to elliptic modular surfaces as deﬁned by Shioda [20].

SCHREIEDER’S SURFACES ARE ELLIPTIC MODULAR

9.1. Preliminaries on Elliptic Modular Surfaces. Following Nori [15], for an elliptic surface
f : S → C with j-invariant j : C → P1, let us deﬁne

C(cid:48) = C\j−1{0, 1728,∞}.

In particular, for every v ∈ C(cid:48), the ﬁber Fv = f−1(v) is smooth. Hence S|C(cid:48) = f−1(C(cid:48)) → C(cid:48) is a
diﬀerentiable ﬁber bundle. Thus, the ﬁrst homology groups of the ﬁbers of this bundle are a locally
constant sheaf on C(cid:48). In fact, this sheaf on C(cid:48) can be extended to all of C [11, page 126]. This
sheaf G on the entirety of C is called the homological invariant of the elliptic surface S.
Consider the monodromy homomorphism ρ : π1(C(cid:48)) → SL(2, Z) associated to f : S → C.
Observe that ρ both determines and is determined by the sheaf G.
Conversely, let j : C → P1 be a holomorphic map from an algebraic curve C to P1 and let
C(cid:48) = C\j−1{0, 1728,∞}. Let H = {z ∈ C | Im(z) > 0} be the upper half-plane in C and consider
the elliptic modular function J : H → P1\{0, 1728,∞}. Finally let U(cid:48) be the universal cover of C(cid:48).
Then there exists a holomorphic map w : U(cid:48) → H such that the following diagram commutes:

(26)

U(cid:48)

π

C(cid:48)

w

H

J

j

P1\{0, 1728,∞}.

This map w thus induces a homormphism ρ : π1(C(cid:48)) → P SL(2, Z).

Now suppose we have a homomorphism ρ : π1(C(cid:48)) → SL(2, Z) such that the following diagram

commutes:

π1(C(cid:48))

ρ

ρ

P SL(2, Z)

.

Then it is possible to construct a unique elliptic surface f : S → C having j-invariant given by the
holomorphic map j : C → P1 and having homological invariant given by the sheaf G associated to
the homomorphism ρ [10, Section 8].
So now consider any ﬁnite-index subgroup Γ of the modular group SL(2, Z) not containing −Id.
Then Γ acts on the upper half plane H and the quotient Γ\H, together with a ﬁnite number of
cusps, forms an algebraic curve CΓ. For any other such subgroup Γ(cid:48), if Γ ⊂ Γ(cid:48), then the canonical
map Γ\H → Γ(cid:48)\H extends to a holomorphic map CΓ → CΓ(cid:48). In particular, taking Γ(cid:48) = SL(2, Z)
and identifying CΓ(cid:48) with P1 via the elliptic modular function J, we get a holomorphic map

jΓ : CΓ → P1.

Hence, as discussed, there exists a w : U(cid:48) → H ﬁtting into a diagram (26) which induces a
representation ρ : π1(C(cid:48)) → Γ ⊂ P SL(2, Z), where Γ is the image of Γ in P SL(2, Z). Because
Γ contains no element of order 2, this homomorphism ρ lifts to a homomorphism ρ : π1(C(cid:48)) →
SL(2, Z), which then gives rise to a sheaf GΓ on CΓ.
Deﬁnition 9.1. [20] For any ﬁnite index subgroup Γ of SL(2, Z) not containing −Id, the associated
elliptic surface f : SΓ → CΓ having j-invariant jΓ and homological invariant GΓ is called the elliptic
modular surface attached to Γ.
9.2. The case of Xc. We now return to considering the elliptic surface f : Xc → P1. Recall that
we have studied the j-invariant of f : Xc → P1 in detail in Proposition 8.2.

Then consider the subgroup Γc of index 6 · 3c in SL(2, Z) with the following presentation:

Γc := (cid:104)A0, A1, . . . , A3c, A∞ | A0A1 ··· A3cA∞ = Id(cid:105).

We remark that Γc is not a congruence subgroup as it does not appear on the list in [6] of the genus
0 congruence subgroups of SL(2, Z) (see [4] for more details on such subgroups).
Theorem 9.2. For c ≥ 2, the surface Xc is the elliptic modular surface attached to Γc.
Proof. A result of Mangala Nori shows that an extremal elliptic surface f : S → C with a section
and with non-constant j-invariant is an elliptic modular surface as long as f : S → C has no
singular ﬁbers of type II∗ or III∗ in Kodaira’s classiﬁcation [15, Theorem 3.5]. Therefore, since
the surface f : Xc → P1 is extremal (by Corollary 6.1), has a section (by Proposition 7.1), has
non-constant j-invariant (by Lemma 8.1), and only has ﬁbers of type Ib and I∗
b (by Theorem 5.1),
we know Xc is indeed an elliptic modular surface.
So let Γ be the ﬁnite-index subgroup of SL(2, Z) attached to Xc. By Proposition 8.2, the degree
of the j-invariant of f : Xc → P1 is 6 · 3c. Hence the group Γ has index 6 · 3c in SL(2, Z).
Now consider the j-invariant j : P1 → P1 of Xc, which we have investigated in Proposition 8.2.
Let C(cid:48) = P1\{0, 1728,∞}.

Because Xc is elliptic modular, its j-invariant induces a homomorphism

ρ : π1(C(cid:48)) → Γ ⊂ SL(2, Z).

Let us write the set

j−1{0, 1728,∞} = {v1, . . . , vs}.

By Proposition 8.1, we know s = 5 · 3c + 2. For each point vi let αi be the loop element in π1(C(cid:48))
going around vi. Then π1(C(cid:48)) is the free group on these generators α1, . . . , αs subject to the relation
(taken in cyclic order) α1 ··· αs = 1 [3, Lemma 2.1].
Now, by Proposition 8.1 all of the points vi such that j(vi) = 0 have ramiﬁcation index 3. Hence
by [15, Proposition 1.4], for the corresponding αi, we have ρ(αi) = ±Id. However since Xc is elliptic
modular, the subgroup Γ cannot contain −Id. Hence, for all i such that j(vi) = 0, we must have
ρ(αi) = Id.
Similarly, by Proposition 8.1 all of the points vi such that j(vi) = 1728 have ramiﬁcation index 2.
But then by [15, Proposition 1.4], for all such i, we have ρ(αi) = ±Id and thus, in fact, ρ(αi) ∈ Id.
Therefore the only points vi ∈ j−1{0, 1728,∞} that contribute non-identity elements to Γ are
the points sent to ∞ by j. These are exactly the points of P1 underneath the singular ﬁbers of
f : Xc → P1. From [20, Proposition 4.2], if a point vi has singular ﬁber of type Ib with b > 0, then
we have:

If a point vi has singular ﬁber of type I∗

b with b > 0, then we have:

Therefore, using Theorem 5.1, in the case of f : Xc → P1, the point 0 contributes a generator A0
