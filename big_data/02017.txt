ABSTRACT

A radial velocity (RV) survey for intermediate-mass giants has been operated for
over a decade at Okayama Astrophysical Observatory (OAO). The OAO survey has
revealed that some giants show long-term linear RV accelerations (RV trends), indi-
cating the presence of outer companions. Direct imaging observations can help clarify
what objects generate these RV trends. We present the results of high-contrast imag-
ing observations of six intermediate-mass giants with long-term RV trends using the
Subaru Telescope and HiCIAO camera. We detected co-moving companions to γ Hya
B (0.61+0.12
−0.14M⊙), HD 5608 B (0.10 ± 0.01M⊙), and HD 109272 B (0.28 ± 0.06M⊙).
For the remaining targets(ι Dra, 18 Del, and HD 14067) we exclude companions more
massive than 30-60 MJup at projected separations of 1′′–7′′. We examine whether these
directly imaged companions or unidentiﬁed long-period companions can account for the
RV trends observed around the six giants. We ﬁnd that the Kozai mechanism can
explain the high eccentricity of the inner planets ι Dra b, HD 5608 b, and HD 14067 b.

Introduction

The radial velocity (RV) technique has played a signiﬁcant role in the search for exoplanets
and has been used in the discovery of more than 500 planets in the last 20 years. However, the
RV technique is less sensitive to wide-orbit planets with a semimajor axis larger than ∼10 AU.
To conﬁrm the existence of such planets, it is necessary to monitor the RV variation of the host
star over an extremely long period, which is impractical. Hence, the occurrence rate of such
wide-orbit planets remains poorly examined, even though it is a critical factor for testing planet
formation/evolution theories such as core accretion (e.g., Pollack et al. 1996), gravitational disk
instability (e.g., Durisen et al. 2007), and planet migration (e.g., Kley & Nelson 2012).

The long-term RV acceleration (RV trends) of a host star is useful information for uncovering
possible planetary companions in wide orbits. If a companion exists beyond ∼10 AU from the host
star, the companion generates an almost linear trend in the RV of the host star within a relatively

short period. The slope of the trend depends on the mass and the semi-major axis of the RV trend
generator (RVTG), and we can estimate its minimum mass based on the following relation:

˙v ∼ mp sin i

G
a2

(1)

where mp is the RVTG mass, i is the orbital inclination, G is the gravitational constant, a is the
semi-major axis of the RVTG, and ˙v is the RV trend. For example, an RV trend of 10 m/s/yr
corresponds to 5MJup, the minimum mass of the RVTG at a semi-major axis of 10 AU. However,
such an RV trend could just as easily be generated by a face-on or distant stellar companion or a
brown-dwarf companion as a planetary one. A companion with mp sin i ∼ 0.5M⊙ located at 100
AU also yields an RV trend of 10 m/s/yr for the host star. Accordingly, the detection of the RV
trend alone is not suﬃcient to identify the RVTG.

In contrast, direct imaging techniques are sensitive to such wide-orbit companions. Direct
imaging technique can achieve a contrast better than 10−5 at a separation of 1.′′0 from a central
star (e.g., Suzuki et al. 2010) and thus can easily identify a stellar companion. Hence, this technique
can help us to clarify the true nature of an RVTG. Even non-detection of any companions is useful
for constraining the range of the mass and semi-major axis of an RVTG by a simultaneous analysis
of the direct-imaging and RV-trend data.

One study that employs this idea, namely, combining direct imaging and the RV-trend ob-
servations, is called TaRgetting bENchmark objects with Doppler Spectroscopy (TRENDS; e.g.
Crepp et al. 2012), which attempts to detect companions around FGKM-type stars showing RV
trends. The study has discovered three low-mass stellar companions (Crepp et al. 2012), a tertiary
stellar companion (Crepp et al. 2013a), a white dwarf companion (Crepp et al. 2013b), and a T
dwarf (Crepp et al. 2014). Also, they determined the giant planet occurrence rate around M-dwarf
stars by exploring, via adaptive optics imaging, targets that exhibited an RV trend suggestive of
an exoplanet companion (Montet et al. 2014). Furthermore, this technique has revealed that stars
hosting a hot-Jupiter tend to be accompanied by a stellar companion (Knutson et al. 2014). These
results clearly show that direct imaging observations can help us to explore and identify distant
companions that generate RV trends in host stars.

At Okayama Astrophysical Observatory (OAO), an RV survey targeting intermediate-mass
giants (1.5–5 M⊙) has been conducted for over a decade (e.g., Sato et al. 2003). Sato et al. (2008)
found that there is a diﬀerence between orbits of planets around intermediate-mass stars and around
lower-mass FGK stars. Most planets around intermediate-mass stars have a semi-major axis larger
than 0.6 AU, while FGK stars have shorter-period planets. Hence, it was suggested that the orbital
distribution of exoplanets around intermediate-mass stars is diﬀerent from that around solar-type
stars. In addition, the OAO survey detected long-term RV trends in several targets, which indicates
the presence of distant companions around them. The widest-orbit of planets or brown dwarfs
so far discovered is 5 AU (Sato et al. 2013a). Identifying the companions that generate the RV
trend can improve our knowledge of exoplanet populations for intermediate-mass stars, which are

– 5 –

not well understood compared to solar-type stars.

To clarify the nature of the RVTGs around intermediate-mass stars observed in the OAO
RV survey, we have performed direct-imaging observations as part of the Strategic Exploration of
Exoplanets and Disks with Subaru (SEEDS; Tamura 2009) project. SEEDS has discovered stellar
companions around transiting planet systems (Narita et al. 2010, 2012; Takahashi et al. 2013),
as well as planetary companions(e.g. Kuzuhara et al. 2013). While TRENDS targeted FGKM-
type stars, our campaign has focused on intermediate-mass stars with RV trends and is therefore
complementary to TRENDS. We imaged ﬁve stellar companions around these targets, and three
companions are likely to be sources of RVTGs. In Section 2, we describe the RV and direct-imaging
observations and the data reduction.
In Section 3 we present the results of the direct imaging
observations. In Section 4, we discuss the results and verify whether our imaged companions can
generate the RV trends. We also discuss the orbit evolution of inner eccentric planets based on the
Kozai mechanism. Finally, we summarize our results and discussion in Section 5.

2. Observations

RV observations at OAO have identiﬁed ﬁve intermediate-mass giants with linear RV trends.
In order to clarify the objects that cause the RV trends, we observed the ﬁve giants via direct
imaging. Apart from the OAO survey, Zechmeister et al. (2008) and Kane et al. (2010) found a
linear RV trend around another giant, ι Dra. The RVTG of ι Dra has been unclear, so we also
carried out direct imaging observations of this giant. In total, we observed six intermediate-mass
giants showing linear RV trends in the SEEDS campaign. Table 1 shows the stellar properties of
our six targets. Note that four of the targets have already known RV planets (Table 2). In this
section, we describe our Doppler measurement observations, orbital ﬁtting analysis to the RV data,
and direct imaging observations.

2.1. Doppler measurement observations

We obtained RV data for the targets except for ι Dra with the 1.88-m telescope and the HIgh
Dispersion Echelle Spectrograph (HIDES; Izumiura 1999) at OAO between 2001 and 2014. We
used an iodine absorption cell (I2 cell; Kambe et al. 2002) for precise RV measurements, which
provides a ﬁducial wavelength reference in a wavelength range of 5000–5800 ˚A. We used the
HIDES-slit mode setting with a slit width of the spectrograph of 200 µm (0.′′76), which corresponds
to a spectral resolution (R = λ/∆λ) of 67000 by about 3.3-pixel sampling. Reduction of the echelle
data (i.e., bias subtraction, ﬂat-ﬁelding, scattered-light subtraction, and spectrum extraction) was

– 6 –

performed using the IRAF software package1.

For precise RV analysis, we modeled I2-superposed stellar spectra (star+I2) by the method
detailed in Sato et al. (2002) and Sato et al. (2012), which is based on the method by Butler et al.
(1996) and Valenti et al. (1995). In the method, a star+I2 spectrum is modeled as a product of a
high resolution I2 and a stellar template spectrum convolved with a modeled instrumental proﬁle
(IP) of the spectrograph. The stellar template spectrum is obtained by deconvolving a pure stellar
spectrum with an IP estimated from a B-star or ﬂat spectrum taken through a I2 cell. We achieved a
long-term RV precision of about 4 m s−1 over the entire span of the observations. The measurement
error was derived from an ensemble of the velocities from each of the ∼300 spectral segments (each
∼3˚A long) in every exposure. We show the derived RVs for 18 Del, γ Hya, and HD 109272 in Figure
1 and Figure 2, and have listed them in Table 3, Table 4, and Table 5 together with the estimated
uncertainties. The RVs for 18 Del were updated and extended from those presented in Sato et al.
(2008). The RVs for HD 5608 and HD 14067 presented in Sato et al. (2012) and Wang et al. (2014),
respectively, were used for the analysis in this paper.

2.2. Orbital ﬁtting

After the ﬁrst announcement of the discovery of a planet around 18 Del by Sato et al. (2008),
we collected 31 more epochs of RV data for the star in ﬁve years and updated its orbital parameters
including a possible linear velocity trend (∼ 4 m s−1 yr−1) suggested in Sato et al. (2008). The
updated orbital parameters and the uncertainties were derived using the Bayesian Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) method (e.g., Ford 2005; Gregory 2005; Ford & Gregory 2007), following
the analysis in Sato et al. (2013b). An extra Gaussian noise factor representing stellar jitter for the
data and a linear velocity trend were incorporated as free parameters. We generated 10 indepen-
dent chains having 107 points with an acceptance rate of about 25%, the ﬁrst 10% of which were
discarded, and conﬁrmed that each parameter suﬃciently converged based on the Gelman–Rubbin
statistic (Gelman & Rubbin 1992). We derived the median value of the merged posterior probabil-
ity distribution function (PDF) for each parameter and set the 1σ uncertainty as the range between
15.87% and 84.13% of the PDF. We plot the derived Keplerian orbit together with the RV points
and their measurement errors including the jitter in Figure 1, and list the orbital parameters and
the uncertainties in Table 6. We conﬁrmed the linear velocity trend for the star to be ˙γ = −2.8±0.7
m s−1 yr−1 with 4σ conﬁdence.

For γ Hya and HD 109272, we ﬁt the linear velocity trends using the method of least squares.

The trends of our targets are summarized in Table 7.

2.3. Direct imaging observations

Direct imaging observations were conducted from 2011 to 2014 as part of the SEEDS survey
(Tamura 2009) using the High Contrast Instrument for the Subaru Next Generation Adaptive
Optics (HiCIAO; Suzuki et al. 2010) on the 8.2-m Subaru Telescope. We used the adaptive optics
system AO188 (Hayano et al. 2008) together with HiCIAO, and the target stars themselves were
used as the natural guide stars in our observations. In addition, we used an atmospheric dispersion
corrector (ADC), which helped mitigate the drift of the stellar PSFs on the detector (Egner et al.
2010). Furthermore, the angular diﬀerential imaging (ADI) method (Marois et al. 2006) was applied
to our observations to improve the high-contrast performance. All six targets were ﬁrst observed in
2011–2012 in the H-band(∼1.6 µm) and four targets that have companion candidates were followed
up in 2014 by employing J- (∼1.2 µm), H-, and Ks- (∼2.1 µm) band ﬁlters.

In order to maximize the sensitivity of our observations, it is necessary to use an occulting
mask or to saturate the central star’s PSF. Such masked or saturated images (i.e., science images)
can be taken over relatively long integration times and are used for the companion survey. However,
we require unsaturated and unmasked PSFs of the central stars (i.e., calibration images) for our
measurements of the contrast limit, central star centroid. Therefore, we made unmasked observa-
tions with neutral density (ND) ﬁlters to avoid PSF saturation for each target, selecting ND ﬁlters
of an appropriate transmission based on the central star’s brightness: HiCIAO has ND ﬁlters with
transmittances of 0.854, 0.063, and 0.016%. We obtained the unsaturated and unmasked PSFs
before and after observing the science images for each target. The observation log is summarized
in Table 8.

Our data reduction procedure is as follows. First, we removed stripe patterns (see Suzuki et al.
2010) appearing on each observed frame and subsequently corrected hot and bad pixels. Then, hot-
pixel masks were
run.
To create hot-pixel mask, we used L.A. Cosmic algorithm (van Dokkum 2001) for the data taken
before 2012 September, while our originally-developed routine was applied to the data taken after
2014 April. Flat-ﬁelding was performed following these procedures.

Next, we correct the distortion of the images, since the distortion correction of our observed
images is crucial to achieve reliable astrometry. To measure the distortion map, we usually obtained
images of the globular cluster M5 or M15 in each observing run. The distortion map is made by
comparing the stellar positions on the M5/M15 images taken by HiCIAO with those on the images
taken by the Hubble Space Telescope/ACS whose distortion is well-corrected (Brandt et al. 2013).
Using the measured distortion map, we applied the geometric transformations to the post-ﬂat-
ﬁelded frames. This procedure ﬁxes the plate scale of images to be 9.5 mas.

We estimate the centroids of primary star in the distortion-corrected images using the unsatu-
rated data whose distortions have been also corrected, and shift the positions of central star to the
centers of arrays. Then, we assume that the stellar position on the detector did not drift. We also
calculated the stellar frame-to-frame centroids by ﬁtting the Moﬀat function to the masked PSFs

– 8 –

and conﬁrmed that the PSF drifts are less than 1 pixel (= 9.5 mas) during the observations.

Next, we carried out ADI reductions after subtracting the central star’s radial proﬁle. We
used the locally optimized combination of images (LOCI) algorithm (Lafreni`ere et al. 2007a), which
allows further improvement in our capability to detect faint companions. We evaluated the self-
subtraction eﬀect caused by the LOCI algorithm by embedding artiﬁcial PSFs. To determine a
realistic detection limit, the ﬁnal image was convolved with a circular aperture with a diameter
equal to the PSF FWHM (Lafreni`ere et al. 2007b). Finally, we checked the achieved 5σ contrast-
ratio by calculating the standard deviation within 2-pixel wide rings, from the center to the outer
region every 4.5 pixels.

3. Results

We detected ﬁve companion candidates in the four systems γ Hya, 18 Del, HD 5608, and HD
109272. Follow-up observations conﬁrmed that three of the companion candidates in three systems,
γ Hya, HD 5608, and HD 109272, have a common proper motion. We converted the observed ﬂux of
the companion to its mass using the NextGen model (Hauschildt et al. 1999a,b) or the Dusty model
(Chabrier et al. 2000). The model that was most consistent with regard to the derived mass for all
three bands (J-, H-, Ks-band) was adopted. The targets’ ages, excepting ι Dra, were estimated in
Takeda et al. (2008) by comparing the luminosities and eﬀective temperatures with the theoretical
stellar evolution model (Lejeune and Schaerer 2001). We roughly estimated the age of ι Dra by
comparing its luminosity and eﬀective temperature with a theoretical model (Bressan et al. 2012;
Chen et al. 2015)

3.1. Conﬁrmed stellar companions

3.1.1.

γ Hya

We discovered a companion candidate with an H-band contrast of ∆H = 7.24 located 1.′′6 from
γ Hya, as shown in Figure 3. Two years after the ﬁrst observation, a follow-up observation enabled
us to conﬁrm that the companion candidate, γ Hya B, shares a common proper motion with the
central star (Figure 5). Our astrometric and photometric results are shown in Table 9. Considering
γ Hya’s age (0.37 Gyr, Takeda et al. 2008) and consistency of the mass derived from J-, H-, and
Ks-band photometry, we adopted the 400-Myr NextGen model to convert the measured photometry
into mass. Mass of γ Hya B is 0.61+0.12

−0.14 M⊙ by averaging four independent mass estimates.

– 9 –

3.1.2. HD 5608

We found two companion candidates around HD 5608. The ﬁrst candidate has ∆H = 9.40
with a separation of 0.′′6 and the second has ∆H = 13.1 with a separation of 7.′′4, as shown in Figure
4. The time intervals of our three observations are long enough to allow for common proper motion
tests (Figure 5). We conclude that the close companion candidate HD 5608 B is co-moving and the
other companion candidate at 7.′′4 is a background star. Our astrometric and photometric results for
HD 5608 B are shown in Table 10. Considering that HD 5608 B has an age of 2.5 Gyr (Takeda et al.
2008) , we used the interpolation between the 2-Gyr and 3-Gyr Dusty models to estimate the mass
of HD 5608 B. The mass derived from Dusty is 0.106 ± 0.002 M⊙ from the weighted mean of three
observational results, and that derived from NextGen model is 0.13± 0.01 M⊙. These indicate that
HD 5608 B is a low mass star, and the Dusty model is a model to reproduce the luminocity of the
low-mass stars . Thus, we adopted the interpolation between the 2-Gyr and 3-Gyr Dusty models,
and took the mass of HD 5608 B to be 0.10 ± 0.01 M⊙.

3.1.3. HD 109272

We discovered one companion candidate (∆H = 7.18) at a separation of 1.′′2 from HD 109272
(Figure 3). Follow-up observations allowed a common proper motion test for the candidate (Figure
5), which suggested that the companion candidate HD 109272 B is gravitationally bound to the
central star. Table 11 shows the astrometric and photometric results for HD 109272 B. Its mass was
calculated using the 1-Gyr Dusty model based on an age of HD 109272 B of 1.4 Gyr (Takeda et al.
2008). By averaging two mass estimates derived from two observations, we ﬁnd that HD 109272
B has a mass of 0.28 ± 0.06 M⊙.

3.2. Conﬁrmed background star

3.2.1.

18 Del

We found a faint companion candidate of ∆H = 16.9 with S/N ∼ 5 at 7.′′5 from 18 Del A
(Figure 4). In the July 2012 observation, we were not able to detect the candidate because the
exposure time was not enough to detect the candidate. We detected it again on 2014 June 10th and
we carried out a common proper motion test. The result indicates that the companion candidate
traces the track expected for a background star (Figure 5). The achieved contrast ratio is shown in
Figure 6. The detectable mass limits derived from the COND 0.8-Gyr model (Baraﬀe et al. 2003)
for an age of 18 Del of 0.79 Gyr (Takeda et al. 2008) is displayed in the right panel of Figure 6.
We exclude a ∼ 0.13 M⊙ object at 0.′′5, a ∼ 0.05 M⊙ object at 1.′′0, and a ∼ 0.03 M⊙ ≈ 31 MJup
object beyond 2.′′0 from the central star.

3.3. No companion candidate detections

3.3.1.

ι Dra

We were not able to detect any objects on 2012 May 14 in the H-band for ι Dra beyond
0.′′6. Figure 7 plots the PARSEC isochrone (Bressan et al. 2012) model within the range of the
uncertainty of ι Dra’s mass derived by Baines et al. (2011). The position of ι Dra in the ﬁgure
agrees with an age of 2 Gyr. Hence we use the 2-Gyr COND model (Baraﬀe et al. 1998) to evaluate
the detectable mass limits. Although the age estimation for iot Dra may not be accurate, we note
that there is not a big diﬀerence in the results even if the diﬀerence in the adopted age is ± 1 Gyr.
The excluded object mass range is shown in Figure 6. We exclude a ∼ 0.09 M⊙ object at 1.′′0 and
a ∼ 0.05 M⊙ ≈ 52 MJup object over 2′′.

3.3.2. HD 14067

We were not able to ﬁnd any companion candidates around HD 14067. Figure 6 shows the
5σ detectable mass limit, converted using the COND 0.7-Gyr model for the age of HD 14067
(Wang et al. 2014). No objects with ∼ 0.12 M⊙ at 1.′′0 and ∼ 0.06 M⊙ beyond 2.′′0 are apparent in
the observation.

4. Discussion

4.1. RV trend generators

Combining the RV trend for the primary star with the projected separation of the detected
companions, we can calculate the minimum dynamical mass that would be required to produce the
RV trend with the following equation (Torres 1999; Liu et al. 2002):

also Knutson et al. 2014), and F is a function that depends on the orbital parameters (inclination
i, eccentricity e, longitude of periastron ω, and orbital phase φ) of the companion. Torres (1999)
determined that the minimum value of F (i, e, ω, φ) is 3√3/2. We use this equation to calculate
the minimum mass limited by the RV trend.
If the mass estimated from photometry exceeds
the dynamical minimum mass derived from the RV trend, then we can conclude that a detected
companion is responsible for the observed RV trend, and if not, the companion is not responsible
for the observed RV trend.
Additionally, we calculate a physical (unprojected) separation of
the detected companion from the central star, consulting Howard et al. (2010) who derived a true
separation of a stellar companion around HD 126614 by combining the companion’s estimated mass

– 11 –

with the central star’s RV trend. There are two solutions for each of the three companions. As
a simpliﬁcation, we do not consider projection eﬀects on the orbit, but assume that the projected
separation is equal to the semi-major axis when comparing imaging and RV limits. As shown in
e.g. Brandeker et al. (2006), the statistical mean conversion factor between the semi-major axis and
the projected separation is close to 1 for eccentricity distributions representative of wide binaries,
which supports this approximation.

In the cases where no companion could be found, upper and lower limits for the companion
as function of semi-major axis were calculated (see Figure 8). The lower mass limit from the RV
trend is calculated from Equation 2, and the upper mass limit is set by the detectable mass limit
of the direct-imaging observation. The object that could cause the RV trend is then constrained
between these two limits.

Furthermore, the lack of curvature in a linear trend can be used to exclude the existence of
inner companions. We assume that the time span of the observations must correspond to at most
half an orbital period, or signiﬁcant curvature would necessarily be seen. This sets a lower limit on
the period, and thus an inner limit on the semi-major axis of the companion.

γ Hya – With an angular separation of 1.′′623 (2012 May 13), the dynamical minimum mass of
γ Hya B is 0.25 M⊙. The mass estimated from photometry, 0.61+0.12
−0.14 M⊙, exceeds the dynamical
minimum mass. Therefore, we conclude that γ Hya B is responsible for the observed RV trend.
The physical separation is 67.5 ± 0.6 AU or 159 ± 7 AU.

HD 5608 – The dynamical minimum mass of HD 5608 B is 0.095 M⊙ (2011 Dec. 31). Our
photometric estimated mass is 0.10 ±0.01 M⊙, which is consistent with the dynamical minimum
mass derived from the RV trend. We conﬁrm that the companion is the RV trend generator. The
calculated physical separation is 40 ± 1 AU or 47 ± 3 AU.

HD 109272 – In the HD 109272 system, the dynamical minimum mass limit calculated with
the angular separation on 2012 Apr. 11 is 0.12 M⊙. The estimated mass from the photometry of
HD 109272 B is 0.28±0.06 M⊙. Therefore, we conclude that HD 109272 B is the RV trend generator
for the observed RV trend in HD 109272 A. The true physical separation of HD 109272 B is 59.3
± 0.9 AU or 140 ± 6 AU.

18 Del – Mugrauer et al. (2014) reported that 18 Del A has a distant companion 18 Del B
outside the ﬁeld of view of HiCIAO. The projected separation of 18 Del B is 2199 AU and its mass
is 0.19 M⊙. The dynamical minimum mass at 2199 AU is 181 M⊙. Therefore, 18 Del B cannot
be the source of the observed RV trend. The upper and lower limits for the RVTG are shown in
Figure 8. In addition, the long-term linear RV trend would excludes the existence of inner objects.
The semi-major axis range of the RVTG is a ∼ 10–50 AU. A stellar companion at wide separation
is ruled out, though a low-mass stellar companion at the inner region is possible. The minimum
mass at a = 10 AU is mp ≈ 4 MJup, so the RVTG is either a high-mass planet, a brown dwarf, or
a low-mass stellar companion.

– 12 –

ι Dra – The absence of the detection of any companions around ι Dra is consistent with the
result observed by Kane et al. (2014) at 692 nm and 880 nm. An analysis combining the RV trend
and the HiCIAO result is shown in Figure 8. Considering the linear RV trend observed over a
decade (Kane et al. 2010), the possible innermost object is mp ≈ 16 MJup ata = 9 AU. On ﬁgure 8,
the intersection of the observation detectable line with the dynamical minimum line derived from
the RV trend is a ≈ 31 AU. Hence, the semi-major axis range of the RVTG is a ∼ 9–31 AU. The
mass range implies the RVTG is a brown dwarf or a stellar companion at small separation.

HD 14067 – From the observation result, we can determine limits for identifying the RVTG
for HD 14067 (Figure 8). The linear RV trend over ﬁve years excludes objects in the inner region.
The possible objects’ orbital period is 10 years at least, which means that the innermost possible
RVTG is at a = 10 AU in the HD 14067 system. The minimum dynamical mass at a = 10 AU in
the system is mp ≈ 32 MJup. On ﬁgure 8, the outermost possible RVTG is at a ≈ 49 AU, where
the detectable limit line crosses the dynamical minimum line. The dynamical minimum mass at
a ≈ 49 AU is Mp ≈ 0.74 M⊙. We can rule out a wide-orbit stellar companion, though a stellar
companion at a ∼ 10–49 AU is still possible. The RVTG for HD 14067 is a brown dwarf or a stellar
companion at a ∼ 10–49 AU.

Our high-contrast observations would exclude planetary RVTGs for ﬁve out of the six targets.
The exception, 18 Del, can be either a planet or a low-mass star. To distinguish the nature of the
RVTG of 18 Del, further RV monitoring and higher contrast imaging for the inner region using
extreme AO (e.g., SCExAO; Martinache & Guyon 2009) would be important.

Two systems, ι Dra and HD 14067, for which we cannot identify RVTGs in the high-contrast
imaging, are important. Vigan et al. (2012) reported that the frequency of brown dwarfs about
intermediate-mass stars is as low as 2.8+6.0
−0.9% at a range of separation of 5–320 AU. On the one
hand, Duch´ene & Kraus (2013) reported that the orbital period distribution for intermediate-mass
multiple systems has two peaks at P ≈ 10 days and a ≈ 350 AU. In either case, the two systems
oﬀer unique samples of brown dwarfs or low-mass stars around intermediate-mass stars. Further
high-contrast imaging observations with deeper and inner sensitivity would be important not only
to clarify the frequency of brown dwarfs and low-mass stars around intermediate-mass stars, but
also to study the planet migration of the inner eccentric planets in those systems.

4.2. Mechanism inﬂuencing the orbit of inner eccentric planets

Several studies have revealed that the formation mechanism of eccentric planets cannot be
explained by core accretion theory and Type I/II migration. The Kozai mechanism, which is a
perturbation mechanism from a distant stellar companion (e.g. Wu & Murray 2003), planet–planet
scattering (e.g. Nagasawa et al. 2008), and secular chaotic excursions (e.g. Wu & Lithwick 2010)
are promising approaches to describe eccentric planets.

Four targets have already known inner planets (Table 2). We consider the Kozai mechanism to

explain the eccentric planets, namely a perturbation due to an outer stellar companion periodically
oscillates the eccentricity and inclination of an inner planet. The oscillation timescale of the Kozai
mechanism is calculated by

– 13 –

where MA is the primary star’s mass, mB is the stellar companion’s mass, PB is the period of
the companion, Pb,0 is the initial period of the planet, and eB is the eccentricity of the companion
(Holman et al. 1997).

We calculated the timescale of the Kozai mechanism for the signiﬁcantly high eccentricity
planets ι Dra b, HD 5608 b, and HD 14067 b. For ι Dra b, we assume that its companion has a
mass of 0.18 M⊙ and in a circular orbit at 31 AU, which is the maximum mass and separation. We
then assume that the initial period of the planet is equal to that of a circular orbit of the observed
semi-major axis. The timescale is PKozai ∼ 107 kyr, which is much less than the Gyr order of ι
Dra’s age. The timescale for HD 5608 b, assuming the circular orbit of HD 5608 B, is PKozai ∼ 450
kyr or 277 kyr. The timescale for HD 14067 b is PKozai ∼ 30 kyr with the 0.74 M⊙ object at 49
AU. These timescales are also suﬃciently shorter than the system’s age. It follows from equation
(3) that if the planets have migrated inward from an initially wider separation, then the initial
Kozai timescales would be even shorter. Therefore, we conclude that the Kozai mechanism could
be a plausible explanation for the eccentricity of the planets ι Dra b, HD 5608 b, and HD 14067 b.
We note that an alternative mechanism for producing high eccentricities is planet-planet scattering
(e.g. Nagasawa et al. 2008). This possibility can be tested by continuing RV and direct imaging
observations, in order to search for additional planets in the systems, as well as providing improved
constraints for the orbits of the imaged companions.

5. Conclusion

We present direct-imaging results of intermediate-mass stars with long-term RV trends that
indicate the existence of an outer object. We used the HiCIAO/Subaru Telescope to identify the
objects responsible for the observed RV trends. Our observations revealed that the three evolved
intermediate-mass stars γ Hya, HD 5608, and HD 109272 possess the stellar companions γ Hya B,
HD 5608 B, and HD 109272 B, respectively. We also ruled out the presence of stellar companions
and brown dwarfs for separations from 1′′ to 7′′ for ι Dra, 18 Del, and HD 14067.

We have constrained the nature of the RVTGs around each of the six targets. The detected
companions γ Hya B, HD 5608 B, and HD 109272 B exceed the minimum dynamical mass derived
from the combination of RV and direct imaging observations. We conﬁrm that these companions
are responsible for the observed RV trends. We also calculated the upper and lower limits of the
mass and the semi-major axis for the RVTGs of ι Dra, 18 Del, and HD 14067. These RVTGs are
promising candidates for hosting brown dwarfs or possibly low-mass stellar companions.

– 14 –

The existence of the companions around eccentric planet systems suggests that the Kozai
mechanism is a plausible explanation for the eccentricity. For the three eccentric planet systems,
ι Dra b, HD 5608 b, and HD 14067 b, the Kozai oscillation timescales are signiﬁcantly shorter
than their age, and thus the Kozai mechanism is a plausible explanation for the eccentricity of the
planets.

Fig. 5.— Results of the common proper motion test for the companion candidates. The horizontal
and vertical axes are relative distances from the ﬁrst observation point. In each plot the circle with
a green cross is the ﬁrst observed position with error, the triangle with a red cross represents the
second observed position, and the square with a cyan cross represents the third observed position.
The blue dotted line represents the track of background star motion driven by the stellar parallax
and the proper motion of each star. The blue crosses shows the positions of the observational data
if the companion candidate is a background star.
