in Special Relativistic Field Theories

(Dated:)

A didactic and systematic derivation of Noether point symmetries and conserved currents is put
forward in special relativistic ﬁeld theories, without a priori assumptions about the transformation
laws. Given the Lagrangian density, the invariance condition develops as a set of partial diﬀerential
equations determining the symmetry transformation. The solution is provided in the case of real
scalar, complex scalar, free electromagnetic, and charged electromagnetic ﬁelds. Besides the usual
conservation laws, a less popular symmetry is analyzed: the symmetry associated with the linear
superposition of solutions, whenever applicable. The role of gauge invariance is emphasized. The
case of the charged scalar particle under external electromagnetic ﬁelds is considered, and the
accompanying Noether point symmetries determined.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Symmetry is a fundamental concept in Physics. In the Lagrangian formalism, Noether’s symmetries play a central
role, since Noether’s theorem shows a direct connection between symmetries and conservation laws [10]. In particular,
the starting point of modern gauge theories [7, 12] is a Lagrangian density admitting a prescribed symmetry group.
The associated conservation laws should then reﬂect experimental observations. Examples of conserved quantities
include energy, linear momentum, angular momentum, and electric charge.

A natural requirement in relativistic theories is that the Lagrangian density must be a Lorentz scalar. This
assures the validity of the Poincar´e group, which is the fundamental transformation group on Minkowski space. In
another context, in gauge theories, interactions are obtained from local gauge invariance principles. Usually, the
local gauge symmetry is postulated in advance. Afterward, the action invariance is explicitly veriﬁed [7, 12]. The
question, regarding an opposite point of view, is how to systematically derive Noether symmetries uniquely from
the Lagrangian density, without additional hypothesis. The advantage of the deductive approach is the possibility
of unveiling symmetries not apparent from the very beginning. In addition, given a broad class of Lagrangians, one
might be interested in the identiﬁcation of the particular subclasses admitting Noether symmetries. In Section 7,
this approach is put forward in the case of the charged scalar particle under prescribed external electromagnetic
ﬁelds.
It
should be mentioned that the traditional approach, put forward e.g.
in authoritative textbooks [7, 12, 15, 16] is of
course perfectly well justiﬁed, as long as the overall symmetry structure of space-time and internal space is concerned.
However, sometimes (as in the aforementioned case of the charged scalar particle under external ﬁelds) one might be
interested in subclasses admitting Noether point symmetry, as a toll in the search for suﬃciently simple benchmark
systems.

In this case, not necessarily the external ﬁeld will be compatible with some symmetry transformation.

The present article shows in detail the procedure for the systematic derivation of Noether point (or geometric)
symmetries, applied to special relativistic ﬁeld theories. In fact, in comparison with systems of a discrete number of
degrees of freedom, there are fewer examples of step-by-step calculation of Noether invariance results for continuous
systems, in relativity. For instance, Ref. [8] considers the derivation of integrals of motion for the N-body problem.
With few exceptions [5, 14], most works in this direction assume non-relativistic and discrete systems.

The work considers some of the basic relativistic ﬁeld theories, going from the simplest to the more elaborate
models. Namely, in a sequence, the real scalar, complex scalar, vacuum electromagnetic and coupled complex scalar
and electromagnetic ﬁeld theories will be treated, as case examples for the systematic application of Noether’s theorem
in the search for geometric transformations. In this way, an hierarchy of models will be described from the symmetry
analysis point of view. Although in all studied cases the external symmetries are given by the Poincar´e group, as
expected, the internal symmetries have distinctive features, including global or local gauge symmetries, together with
an additional internal symmetry due to linearity, in the non-interacting ﬁeld cases - to be detailed in the next sections.
It is assumed that the present communication has essentially a methodological character. Nevertheless, it is precisely
the systematic (non ad hoc) procedure that allows the identiﬁcation of the aforementioned extra internal symmetry.
Moreover, it will be addressed the case of a charged scalar particle under external electromagnetic ﬁelds. The class of
external ﬁelds so that Noether point symmetries are admissible will be so determined, for the ﬁrst time, as well as the
accompanying conservation laws. The problem has interest for strong laser-plasma interactions, where test-particle
dynamics has both relativistic and quantum aspects [9].

2

Evidently, nowadays a large number of packages is available for the calculation of Noether point symmetries using
computer algebra software. Nevertheless, the interest still remains for some people at least, to not blindly follow the
computer’s advice and to personally understand all the steps in the symmetry procedure. Moreover, in the same
trend, the version of the Noether theorem presented below, is certainly not the most abstract, general or rigorous
possible. Nevertheless, for practical applications, it might be of some interest to present the subject in a modest,
more readable fashion for non-mathematicians. Finally, it should be noted that the manuscript is not intended to
be a review. Therefore a detailed, encyclopaedic account of updated references on symmetries and conservation laws
should be found elsewhere.

This work is organized as follows. In Section 2, the Noether theorem is reviewed. In Section 3, the Noether point
symmetries and conservation laws are deduced in the case of the real scalar ﬁeld. The same procedure is repeated
in the remaining sections, for increasing complexity of the models. Section 4 is dedicated to the complex scalar
ﬁeld. Section 5 is dedicated to the vacuum electromagnetic ﬁeld. Section 6 considers the coupled complex scalar
and electromagnetic ﬁelds. Section 7 is devoted to the charged scalar particle under external electromagnetic ﬁelds.
Section 8 presents some conclusions.

II. NOETHER’S THEOREM

In this Section, the Noether’s theorem is enunciated in the case of a single ﬁeld, the generalization to the multi-ﬁeld

case being straightforward. The starting point is the action functional,

S =Z L(φ, ∂µφ, x) d4x ,

where φ = φ(x) is the pertinent ﬁeld, L is the Lagrangian density of the indicated arguments, and x is a 4-vector with
covariant components xµ = (t, r) = (x0, x1, x2, x3). The metric tensor will be taken as gµν = diag(1,−1,−1,−1).
Natural units c = 1,  = 1 and the Einstein summation convention will be employed. Greek indexes run from 0 to 3,
and Latin indexes from 1 to 3.

The inﬁnitesimal point transformations given by

xµ → xµ + ε ηµ(φ, x) ,
φ → φ + ε ψ(φ, x) ,

will be considered, where ε is a real inﬁnitesimal parameter and where ηµ(φ, x), ψ(φ, x) are smooth functions not
dependent on the ﬁeld derivatives. Dynamical symmetries, where the transformation law involves the ﬁeld derivatives,
are fundamental in many cases [1]. For instance, the derivation of the inﬁnite hierarchy of conserved functionals for
the Korteweg-de Vries equation [11] needs the application of dynamical symmetries. Nevertheless, for simplicity this
work is restricted to point transformations only.

The (quasi) invariance condition for the action is given [6, 13] by

∂L
∂φ

ψ +

∂L

∂(∂µφ)

(dµψ − dνφ ∂µην ) + ∂µL ηµ + L dµηµ = dµσµ ,

(1)

where σµ = σµ(φ, x) is at this stage an arbitrary 4-vector of the indicated arguments. Actually, the condition (1)
does not assures the strict invariance of the action, which can be modiﬁed by the addition of a constant surface term,
namely, the surface integral of σµ at inﬁnity. However, a numerical constant added to the action, has not any eﬀect
on the form of the Euler-Lagrange equations.

For the sake of notation, we denote total derivatives as dµ and partial derivatives (maintaining constant ﬁelds and

derivatives of the ﬁelds) as ∂/∂ xµ = ∂µ. For instance,

dµL = ∂µL +

∂L
∂φ

∂µφ +

∂L
∂(∂νφ)

∂µ∂νφ .

Noether’s theorem assures that whenever the symmetry condition (1) is satisﬁed, there is a conserved current given

by

J µ = θµ

ν ην −

∂L

∂(∂µφ)

ψ + σµ ,

(2)

where the energy-momentum tensor θµ

ν is deﬁned by

The conservation law reads

where φ solves the Euler-Lagrange equation,

dµJ µ = 0 ,

∂φ − dµ(cid:18) ∂L

∂(∂µφ)(cid:19) = 0 .

(3)

The basic question to be addressed here is: given the Lagrangian density, how to systematically derive the inﬁnites-
imal symmetry transformations leaving the action functional invariant up to the addition of a surface term? The
answer, to be developed in the examples in the next sections, is as follows. Inserting the Lagrangian density into the
invariance condition (1), typically we obtain a polynomial equation on the ﬁeld derivatives. The coeﬃcient of each
diﬀerent ﬁeld derivative must be zero. Otherwise, one would impose additional constraints on the ﬁeld, which should
be ideally leaved free as much as possible. Therefore, a set of partial diﬀerential equations for the symmetry functions
will be derived, not involving the derivatives of the ﬁeld. Solving the determining partial diﬀerential equations in
all generality, we obtain the full set of Noether point symmetries, without ad hoc postulates. The procedure will be
worked out in the following examples, starting with one of the simplest relativistic models, namely, the Klein-Gordon
ﬁeld.

III. REAL SCALAR FIELD

A. Noether Symmetries for the Real Scalar Field

The Lagrangian density for the real scalar ﬁeld is

L =

1
2

∂µφ ∂µφ −

1
2

m2 φ2 ,

where m is the particle mass. Using the Euler-Lagrange equation (3), we derive Klein-Gordon’s equation,

∂µ∂µφ + m2φ = 0 .

Inserting L from Eq. (4) into the symmetry condition (1), it follows that

−m2φ ψ + ∂µφ (dµψ − ∂νφ dµην ) +

1
2

(∂µφ ∂µφ − m2φ2)dν ην = dµσµ .

(4)

(5)

The quantities ηµ and ψ should be managed so that the left-hand side of Eq. (5) becomes the divergence of some
appropriate 4-vector σµ.

The following total derivatives

∂φ

4

Equation (6), to be identically satisﬁed, is a polynomial expression on the ﬁeld derivatives. Therefore, the coeﬃcient

of each monomial (term with equal derivative power) should vanish. The third order terms give

∂µφ ∂µφ ∂ν φ

∂ην
∂φ

= 0 ⇒ ηµ = ηµ(x) .

In another words, the external transformations (aﬀecting the space-time coordinates only) are not dependent on φ.

The second order terms in Eq. (6) imply

∂µφ ∂µφ (cid:18) ∂ψ

∂φ

+

2

∂νην(cid:19) − ∂µφ ∂νφ ∂µην = 0 .

The last equation decomposes itself into a set of equations, corresponding to terms proportional to ∂0φ ∂0φ, ∂0φ ∂iφ
and ∂iφ ∂j φ. A detailed examination shows that the resulting equations are reducible to

together with

− ∂0η0 = ∂1η1 = ∂2η2 = ∂3η3 ,
∂µην + ∂νηµ = 0 , µ 6= ν ,

∂ψ
∂φ

(8)

(9)

where Eq. (7) was taken into account for Eq. (9). We left the system (7)-(8) untouched by now. Equation (9) gives

where ˜φ(x) is an arbitrary function of x.

The invariance condition (6), for the terms which are of ﬁrst order in the derivatives, leaves us with

ψ = −φ ∂0η0 + ˜φ(x) ,

with the solution

∂σµ
∂φ

= ∂µψ = −φ ∂µ∂0η0 + ∂µ ˜φ ,

σµ = −

∂µ∂0η0 + φ ∂µ ˜φ + ˜σµ(x) ,

where ˜σµ(x) is an arbitrary 4-vector depending only on x.

The zeroth-order term on Eq. (5) implies

Inserting the results from Eqs. (7), (10) and (11) into Eq. (12), one get

−m2φ ψ −

m2φ2 ∂µηµ = ∂µσµ .

(cid:18)−

∂µ∂µ∂0η0 + m2∂0η0(cid:19) φ2 +(cid:16)∂µ∂µ ˜φ + m2 ˜φ(cid:17) φ + ∂µ ˜σµ = 0 .

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

Equation (13), being identically satisﬁed for any φ, implies that the coeﬃcients of diﬀerent powers of the ﬁeld vanish,
or,

Equation (14) can be rewritten as

1
2

−

∂µ∂µ∂0η0 + m2∂0η0 = 0 ,

∂µ∂µ ˜φ + m2 ˜φ = 0 ,
∂µ ˜σµ = 0 .

∂0(cid:0)∂µ∂µη0 − 2 m2η0(cid:1) = 0 ,

(14)

(15)
(16)

(17)

or,

∂µ∂µη0 − 2 m2η0 = −2 m2 ˜η0(r) ,

5

(18)

where ˜η0(r) is a function of space coordinates only.

The next information, comes from Eq. (15) showing that ˜φ solves the Klein-Gordon equation. Therefore, adding to
φ a particular solution of the Klein-Gordon equation is a Noether symmetry, reﬂecting the linearity of the equation.
In addition, Eq. (16) shows that

without loss of generality.

While Eqs. (15) and (16) have already been fully examined, there remains Eq. (14), which is equivalent to Eq.
(18). To analyze the last one, we take into account Eqs. (7) and (8). For instance, considering the ﬁrst line in Eq.
(7), for µ = 0, ν = 1 in Eq. (8), it results

˜σµ = 0 ,

∂1η1 = −∂0η0 ,
To satisfy Cauchy’s condition ∂0∂1η1 = ∂1∂0η1, necessarily

∂0η1 = −∂1η0 .

Similarly, using again Eqs. (7) and (8), we conclude that

∂1∂1η0 = ∂0∂0η0 .

Equations (19) and (20) allow to write

Inserting the last into Eq. (17) gives

∂2∂2η0 = ∂3∂3η0 = ∂0∂0η0 .

∂µ∂µη0 = −2 ∂0∂0η0 .

∂0∂0η0 + m2η0 = m2 ˜η0(r) .

(19)

(20)

(21)

Only time-derivatives appear in the diﬀerential equation (21). Therefore, in this context, ˜η0(r) is a constant, and the
general solution obviously is

η0 = ˜η0(r) + F (r)eimt + G(r)e−imt ,

(22)

where F (r) and G(r) are arbitrary functions of the space coordinates only.

From now on, sometimes we denote r = (x, y, z) whenever convenient, as long as there is no risk of confusion
between the space-time 4-vector x = (t, r) and the coordinate x. Following this deﬁnition, and inserting Eq. (22) into
(7), the result is

η1 = ˜η1(y, z, t) − im eimtZ dx F + im e−imtZ dx G ,
η2 = ˜η2(x, z, t) − im eimtZ dy F + im e−imtZ dy G ,
η3 = ˜η3(x, y, t) − im eimtZ dz F + im e−imtZ dz G ,

(23)

(24)

(25)

where ˜η1, ˜η2 and ˜η3 are arbitrary functions of the indicated arguments.

The solution presented in Eqs. (22)-(25) must be compatible with Eq. (8). For instance, for µ = 0, ν = 1 in Eq.

(8), we obtain

∂
∂ t

˜η1 +

∂
∂ x

˜η0 + eimt (cid:18)m2Z dx F +

∂ F

∂ x(cid:19) + e−imt (cid:18)m2Z dx G +

∂G

∂ x(cid:19) = 0 .

The derivative of the last equation with respect to x implies

∂2 ˜η0

∂ x2 + m2G(cid:19) = 0 .

∂ x2 + eimt(cid:18) ∂2F

∂ x2 + m2F(cid:19) + e−imt(cid:18) ∂2G

Since neither ˜η0, nor F, G have a dependence on time, it follows that

∂2F
∂ x2 + m2F =

∂2G
∂ x2 + m2G = 0 ,

∂2 ˜η0
∂ x2 = 0 .

6

(26)

(27)

Equation (27) will not have immediate consequences. On the other hand, following a procedure similar to the
derivation of Eq. (26), we obtain

∂2F
∂ y2 + m2F =
∂2G
∂ y2 + m2G =

∂2F
∂ z2 + m2F = 0 ,
∂2G
∂ z2 + m2G = 0 .

The (unique) solution for the system composed by Eqs. (26), (28)-(29) is

F = c1 exp[im(x + y + z)] + c2 exp[im(x + y − z)]
+ c3 exp[im(x − y + z)] + c4 exp[im(−x + y + z)]
+ c5 exp[im(x − y − z)] + c6 exp[im(−x + y + z)]
+ c7 exp[im(−x − y + z)] + c8 exp[−im(x + y + z)] ,

G = c9 exp[im(x + y + z)] + c10 exp[im(x + y − z)]

+ c11 exp[im(x − y + z)] + c12 exp[im(−x + y + z)]
+ c13 exp[im(x − y − z)] + c14 exp[im(−x + y + z)]
+ c15 exp[im(−x − y + z)] + c16 exp[−im(x + y + z)] ,

where c1, . . . c16 are numerical constants. Hence,

η0 = ˜η0(x, y, z) + c1 exp[im(x + y + z + t)]

+ ··· + c16 exp[−im(x + y + z + t)] ,

η1 = ˜η1(y, z, t) − c1 exp[im(x + y + z + t)]

+ ··· − c16 exp[−im(x + y + z + t)] ,

η2 = ˜η2(x, z, t) − c1 exp[im(x + y + z + t)]

+ ··· − c16 exp[−im(x + y + z + t)] ,

η3 = ˜η3(x, y, t) − c1 exp[im(x + y + z + t)]

+ ··· − c16 exp[−im(x + y + z + t)] ,

(28)

(29)

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

where the terms depending on c2, . . . , c15 were omitted, for brevity.

It remains the constraint (8). Taking µ = 1, ν = 2 in Eq. (8) and inserting Eqs. (31)-(32), results in

∂1 ˜η2 + ∂2 ˜η1 − 2 imc1 exp[im(x + y + z + t)]

+ ··· + 2 imc16 exp[−im(x + y + z + t)] = 0 .

Derivation of the last with respect to x and y, shows that

2 im3 {c1 exp[im(x + y + z + t)] + ··· + c16 exp[−im(x + y + z + t)]} = 0 ,

so that

c1 = ··· = c16 = 0 .

Since all numerical constants c1, . . . , c16 vanish, and using Eqs. (8), (30)-(33), we get the compact expressions

∂µην + ∂ν ηµ = 0 ,

(34)

generalizing Eq. (8) to arbitrary indexes µ, ν.

7

We are almost done. However, we should still take into account Eq. (34), applying appropriate derivatives to it.

For instance, for µ = 0, ν = 1, diﬀerentiation with respect to x recalling that ˜η0 does not depend on time, gives

Similar calculations, involving appropriate indexes and derivatives of Eq. (34), shows that the functions ηµ are at
most linear functions of space-time coordinates. In other words,

∂1∂1η0 = 0 .

˜ηµ = aµ + Rµ

ν xν ,

where aµ is an arbitrary constant 4-vector and Rµ
are not entirely free. Indeed, Eq. (34) implies

ν is a constant second-rank tensor. However, the components Rµ
ν

Rµν + Rνµ = 0 ,

so that Rµ
(1), applied to the real scalar ﬁeld.

ν is an anti-symmetric tensor. This exhausts the information contained in the Noether symmetry condition

We are at a convenient point to enumerate the results until now. The Noether symmetries are completely speciﬁed

by

ηµ = aµ + Rµ
ψ = ˜φ(x) ,

ν xν ,

ν a constant anti-symmetric tensor, while ˜φ is any solution of the Klein-Gordon
where aµ is a constant 4-vector and Rµ
equation. Therefore, we are left with a 10-parameter external symmetry group for space-time coordinates, plus the
internal symmetry transformation due to linearity. Naturally, the external symmetry group is Poincar´e’s group, where
aµ relates to space-time translations, Rij relates to spatial rotations, and R0i corresponds to Lorentz boosts.

B. Conserved Currents for the Real Scalar Field

To obtain the conserved current deﬁned in Eq. (2), the 4-vector σµ is needed. From Eq. (11), we obtain

so that

σµ = φ ∂µ ˜φ ,

J µ = ∂µφ aν ∂νφ − aµL + ∂µφ ∂ν φ Rν

(35)

where L is given by Eq. (4).
set a0 = 1, together with the remaining parameters and ˜φ vanishing. From expression (35), we get

It is interesting to examine the conservation laws associated with diﬀerent symmetries. For time translations, we

J 0 =

2 (cid:2)(∂0φ)2 + (∇φ)2 + m2φ2(cid:3) ,

J i = ∂iφ ∂0φ ,

corresponding to the energy conservation law,

For space translations, we set aµ = (0, a1, a2, a3), together with vanishing remaining parameters and ˜φ. The

conserved currents (one for each component of the translation vector a) can be expressed as

In consequence,

(37)

(36) and the energy density

Taking into account the momentum density πi = ∂0φ ∂iφ which follows from Eq.
H = ∂0φ ∂0φ − L, Eq. (37) reads

d

dt Z (cid:0)x0

π − H r(cid:1) dr = 0 ,

showing, in a more transparent way, that the linear momentum relative to the center of mass is constant. Notice that
the Noether momentum density, a quantity arising from space translation symmetries, in this case is not the same as
the canonical momentum density ∂L/∂(∂0φ) = ∂0φ. Similarly, for a free relativistic particle with momentum p and
energy H, one has (d/dt)(p t − H r) = 0.

Finally, for the internal symmetry, only ˜φ is non-vanishing. In this case,

J µ = φ ∂µ ˜φ − ˜φ ∂µφ ⇒

d

dtZ (cid:16)φ ∂0 ˜φ − ˜φ ∂0φ(cid:17) dr = 0 .

This conserved current is analogous to the constant wronskian of two particular solutions y1,2(t) for a linear harmonic
oscillator equation, namely,

d2y1,2
dt2 + y1,2 = 0 ⇒

dt (cid:19) = 0 .

Recapitulating, we have derived, in a systematic way, the Noether point symmetries group for the real scalar ﬁeld,
obtaining the Poincar´e group (external symmetries) plus an inﬁnite dimensional internal symmetry group, reﬂecting
the linearity of the Klein-Gordon equation. It can be mentioned that such internal Noether symmetry transformation
is not recognized in the literature, as far as we know.

IV. COMPLEX SCALAR FIELD

In this Section, we consider the case of the complex scalar ﬁeld, so that a global gauge symmetry is expected. Let

us verify this, proceeding in a systematic manner, as done in the case of the real scalar ﬁeld.

A. Noether Symmetries for the Complex Scalar Field

The Lagrangian density for the complex scalar ﬁeld is

implying two separate equations for the independent ﬁelds φ, φ∗,

L = ∂µφ∗ ∂µφ − m2 φ∗ φ ,

∂µ∂µφ + m2φ = 0 ,
∂µ∂µφ∗ + m2φ∗ = 0

9

(38)

Due to the linearity of the equations, it is reasonable to suppose the existence of internal Noether symmetries corre-
sponding to the addition of particular solutions.

Consider the inﬁnitesimal point transformations,

xµ → xµ + ε ηµ(φ, φ∗, x) ,
φ → φ + ε ψ(φ, φ∗, x) ,
φ∗ → φ∗ + ε ψ∗(φ, φ∗, x) ,

where ε is an inﬁnitesimal parameter, and where ηµ(φ, φ∗, x), ψ(φ, φ∗, x), ψ∗(φ, φ∗, x) are smooth functions to be
determined and not depending on ﬁeld derivatives. The Noether invariance condition (1), generalized to more than a
single ﬁeld, yields

Inserting L from Eq. (38) into the symmetry condition (1), it results a polynomial on the derivatives of φ, φ∗, to
be identically set to zero. The coeﬃcient of each monomial (term with equal power of the derivatives of the ﬁelds)
should then vanish. For brevity, we will not show the full calculations, which are analogous to the case of the real
scalar ﬁeld.

A tedious analysis shows that Eqs. (40) and (41) satisfy the appropriate Cauchy conditions if and only if

∂1η1 = ∂2η2 = ∂3η3 = −∂0η0 ,
∂µην + ∂νηµ = 0 , µ 6= ν .

In this case, the solution for Eqs. (40)-(41) is

where λ(x), ˜φ(x) and ˜φ∗(x) are arbitrary functions not depending on the ﬁelds. For consistency,

ψ = −φ ∂0η0 − i λ(x)φ + ˜φ(x) ,
ψ∗ = −φ∗ ∂0η0 + i λ(x)φ∗ + ˜φ∗(x) ,

The terms depending on λ(x) are associated with local gauge transformations.

∂µλ(x) = 0 .

(45)

In other words, λ does not depend on x and gauge transformations are global. Besides, in this case we can solve for

where ˜σµ(x) is an arbitrary 4-vector, depending on x only.

Finally, the term not containing ﬁeld derivatives in the invariance condition (1) gives

σµ = −φ∗φ ∂0∂µη0 + φ∗∂µ ˜φ + φ ∂µ ˜φ∗ + ˜σµ(x) ,

The terms proportional to φ∗φ, φ∗, φ and the remaining contribution should identically vanish. Hence,

φ∗φ(cid:0)∂µ∂µ∂0η0 − 2m2∂0η0(cid:1) − φ∗(cid:16)∂µ∂µ ˜φ + m2 ˜φ(cid:17)
−φ(cid:16)∂µ∂µ ˜φ∗ + m2 ˜φ∗(cid:17) − ∂µ ˜σµ = 0 .
∂0(∂µ∂µη0 − 2m2η0) = 0 ,
∂µ∂µ ˜φ + m2 ˜φ = 0 ,
∂µ∂µ ˜φ∗ + m2 ˜φ∗ = 0 ,
∂µ˜σµ = 0 .

(46)

(47)

(48)

(49)
(50)

Equations (48) and (49) show that ˜φ and ˜φ∗ are particular solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation, while Eq. (50)
shows that

without loss of generality. Finally, Eq. (47) reveals that

˜σµ = 0 ,

where ˜η0(r) is an arbitrary time-independent function. Equation (51) coincides with Eq. (18). In this way, we realize
that there is no need to repeat the previous calculations, with the conclusion that the external Noether symmetries
are given by the Poincar´e group. Therefore,

∂µ∂µη0 − 2m2η0 = −2m2 ˜η0(r) ,

ν xν ,
ηµ = = aµ + Rµ
ψ = −iλ φ + ˜φ(x) ,

ν is a second-rank antisymmetric tensor, λ is a real constant and ˜φ, ˜φ∗ are particular
where aµ is a constant 4-vector, Rµ
solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation. To conclude, besides the Poincar´e group, one has the internal symmetries,
composed by a global gauge transformation and a symmetry due to the linearity of the model.

B. Conserved Currents for the Complex Scalar Field

To compute the conserved currents, there is the need of the 4-vector σµ, obtained from Eq. (46),

σµ = φ∗∂µ ˜φ + φ ∂µ ˜φ∗ .

Inserting this 4-vector into J µ in Eq. (39), we get a somewhat long expression. In comparison to the case of the
real scalar ﬁeld, the distinctive feature comes from the global gauge symmetry. Setting λ = 1 and the remaining
contributions to zero, we derive the Noether’s current,

11

corresponding to global electric charge conservation,

J µ
(λ) = i (φ ∂µφ∗ − φ∗∂µφ) ,

The remaining Noether currents are analogous to those derived in Section III B.

V. VACUUM ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD

A. Noether Symmetries for the Electromagnetic Field in Vacuum

Following our schedule, the Noether point symmetries for the vacuum electromagnetic ﬁeld will be studied, without

ad hoc claims. The Lagrangian density is

where

L = −

1
4

F µν Fµν ,

Fµν = ∂µAν − ∂νAµ

(52)

is the electromagnetic tensor, while Aµ = (A0, A) denotes the electromagnetic 4-potential. The Euler-Lagrange
equations are the vacuum Maxwell’s equations,

We can anticipate the existence of internal Noether symmetries, associated with the linearity of the equations.

Suppose the inﬁnitesimal point transformations,

∂ν∂ν Aµ − ∂µ∂ν Aν = 0 .

xµ → xµ + ε ηµ(A, x) ,
Aµ → Aµ + ε Γµ(A, x) ,

where A is a shorthand for the 4-potential, ε an inﬁnitesimal parameter, and ηµ(A, x), Γµ(A, x) functions to be
determined, not depending on ﬁeld derivatives. Since the Lagrangian density contains only ﬁeld derivatives, the
Noether symmetry condition simpliﬁes to

∂L

∂(∂µAν )

(dµΓν − ∂αAν dµηα) + L dµηµ = dµσµ ,

(53)

where, at this stage, σµ = σµ(A, x) is an arbitrary 4-vector with the indicated functional dependence.

The procedure must be clear now. Inserting L from Eq. (52) into Eq. (53) and considering ﬁeld derivatives of third

degree, it follows that

Once again, the space-time transformation rules do not depend on the ﬁelds.

ηµ = ηµ(x) .

After several elementary calculations, the second-order ﬁeld derivative terms give

Γµ = −∂µην Aν + ˜Aµ(x) ,

∂µην + ∂ν ηµ = 0 ,

where the 4-vector ˜Aµ is ﬁeld-independent. As seen before, the Poincar´e group is obtained from Eq. (55).

The ﬁrst-order in the ﬁeld derivative terms give

or, taking into account Eq. (54),

∂µΓν − ∂ν Γµ =

∂σν
∂Aµ ,

∂µ ˜Aν − ∂ν ˜Aµ =

∂σν
∂Aµ ,

with the solution

where ˜σµ(x) is an arbitrary ﬁeld-independent 4-vector.

From the remaining term in the invariance condition, we get

σµ = (∂ν ˜Aµ − ∂µ ˜Aν) Aν + ˜σµ(x) ,

∂µ ˜σµ = 0 ,
∂ν∂ν ˜Aµ − ∂µ(∂ν ˜Aν ) = 0 .

12

(54)
(55)

(56)

(57)

While Eq. (56) shows that ˜σµ is superﬂuous, Eq. (57) implies that ˜Aµ is a particular solution for vacuum Maxwell’s
equations.

Summing up results, and using Eq. (54), we derive the following symmetry transformation functions,

ηµ = aµ + Rµ
Γµ = ˜Aµ(x) + Rµ

νAν ,

νxν , Rµν + Rνµ = 0 ,

where ˜Aµ(x) solves Maxwell’s vacuum equations.

A notorious particular vacuum solution is speciﬁed by local gauge transformations,

˜Aµ = ∂µλ(x) ,

where λ(x) is an arbitrary space-time function.
Maxwell’s equations and local gauge transformations.

In this context there is a link between the linearity of vacuum

where it was deﬁned ˜F µν = ∂µ ˜Aν − ∂ν ˜Aµ.
The usual symmetries (space-time translations and spatial rotations) are fairly well discussed in the literature,
including additional steps such as the symmetrization of the energy-momentum tensor [7]. For instance, in terms of
the electric ﬁeld Ei = −F0i and the magnetic ﬁeld Bi = −(1/2) εijk F jk, where εijk is the 3-dimensional Kronecker
symbol, for time-translations (only a0 = 1 is non-zero) one ﬁnds

J 0 =

1
2

(E2 + B2) + ∇ · (A0 E) − A0 ∇ · E .

The third term is a surface term and so does not contribute to the associated conserved quantity. The last term
vanishes since ∇ · E = 0 in vacuum. The only eﬀective contribution is

Z J 0 dr =

1

2 Z (E2 + B2) dr ,

which is the well-known electromagnetic energy density.

Actually the conserved current (58) can be put into a more traditional and gauge-invariant form, as follows. One

has

Most terms in (59) are total divergence terms, integrating to zero, or vanish due to Maxwell’s equations in vacuum.

is related to angular momentum conservation. As can be checked, ∂µ J µ = 0 is maintained in the reshaped form (60).
The internal symmetry due to linearity is basically ignored in the usual treatments. As apparent from Eq. (58),

one has the conservation law

d

dt Z (F 0µ ˜Aµ − ˜F 0µ Aµ) dr = 0 ,

where both Aµ, ˜Aµ solve Maxwell’s equations.

The case of local gauge symmetries with ˜Aµ = ∂µλ yields ∂µJ µ

(λ) = 0, where

J µ
(λ) = F µν∂ν λ = ∂ν(F µν λ) − λ ∂ν F µν .

(61)

The subscript λ refers to the particular gauge function employed. At least for λ bounded at inﬁnity, the ﬁrst term
in the right-hand side of Eq. (61) contribute a vanishing surface term, while the last term vanishes due to Maxwell’s
equations in vacuum. Hence in this case ( ˜Aµ = ∂µλ for some function λ) the related conserved charge vanishes.
Otherwise it can happens that the conservation law yields a non-trivial result.

VI. COUPLED COMPLEX SCALAR AND ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS

A. Noether Symmetries for the Coupled Complex Scalar and Electromagnetic Fields

The Lagrangian density follows from the minimal coupling assumption and is given by

L = (∂µφ∗ − i e Aµ φ∗)(∂µφ + i e Aµ φ) − m2φ∗φ −

1
4

F µν Fµν ,

(62)

where e is the particle’s charge and F µν the electromagnetic tensor, as before. The Euler-Lagrange equations are

14

where

DµDµφ + m2φ = 0 ,
(DµDµφ)∗ + m2φ∗ = 0 ,

∂νF µν = i e(cid:16)φ (Dµφ)∗ − φ∗ (Dµφ)(cid:17) ,

Dµφ = (∂µ + i e Aµ) φ ,
(Dµφ)∗ = (∂µ − i e Aµ) φ∗

denote covariant derivatives. Due to presence of matter and the corresponding nonlinearity, we expect a broken
internal symmetry, previously corresponding to the linear superposition law.

Consider inﬁnitesimal point transformations of the form

xµ → xµ + ε ηµ(A, φ, φ∗, x) ,
Aµ → Aµ + ε Γ(A, φ, φ∗, x) ,
φ → φ + ε ψ(A, φ, φ∗, x) ,
φ∗ → φ∗ + ε ψ∗(A, φ, φ∗, x) .

where σµ = σµ(A, φ, φ∗, x) is an arbitrary 4-vector.

∂(∂µφ)

From the cubic in the derivatives terms, it can be shown that

The quadratic terms give

ηµ = ηµ(x) .

Γµ = −∂µην Aν + ˜Aµ(x) ,
ψ = −i e λ(x) φ + ˜φ(x) ,
ψ∗ = i e λ(x) φ∗ + ˜φ∗(x) ,

∂µην + ∂ν ηµ = 0 ,

(63)

where ˜Aµ, ˜φ, ˜φ∗ and λ are ﬁeld independent. The factor e was included for convenience. Moreover, λ is a real
function. Proceeding as in the vacuum case, from Eq. (63) it follows that the external symmetries are associated with
the Poincar´e group.

The linear in the derivative terms imply

∂σν
∂ Aµ = ∂µ ˜Aν − ∂ν ˜Aµ ,
∂σµ
∂φ
∂σµ
∂φ∗ = i e Aµ ˜φ + i e φ ˜Aµ − i e (∂µλ) φ + ∂µ ˜φ .

= −i e Aµ ˜φ∗ − i e φ∗ ˜Aµ + i e (∂µλ) φ∗ + ∂µ ˜φ∗ ,

(64)

(65)

(66)

The integrability condition

∂2σµ
∂φ ∂φ∗ =

∂2σµ
∂φ∗ ∂φ

implies

˜Aµ = ∂µλ .

From Eq. (67) it can be seen that in the presence of matter only (local) gauge symmetries are allowed.

Once Eq. (67) is satisﬁed, it is possible to solve Eqs. (64)-(66), with the result

15

(67)

˜φ = ˜φ∗ = 0 ,
σµ = ˜σµ(x) .

As veriﬁed, the symmetries due to the linearity are completely eliminated.

The remaining terms in the invariance condition give

so that there is no loss of generality to deﬁne

∂µ ˜σµ = 0 ,

˜σµ = 0 .

To conclude, the external symmetries are composed by the Poincar´e transformations, while the internal symmetries

are speciﬁed by

ν Aν + ∂µλ(x) ,

Γµ = Rµ
ψ = −i e λ(x) φ ,
ψ∗ = i e λ(x) φ∗ .

B. Conserved Currents for the Coupled Complex Scalar and Electromagnetic Fields

The general conserved current is

J µ = aν(cid:16)∂νφ (Dµφ)∗ + ∂νφ∗ (Dµφ) − F µα ∂ν Aα − δµ
νL(cid:17)

αi
αL(cid:17) + Aβ F µ

The usual conservation laws (energy, linear momentum, angular momentum) are veriﬁed. Besides, we have the

gauge symmetry, with the conserved current

In particular,

J µ
(λ) = F µν ∂ν λ + i e λ φ (Dµφ)∗ − i e λ φ∗ (Dµφ) .

the last equality coming from Maxwell’s equations. Therefore, dQ(λ)/dt = 0, where

J 0

(λ) = ∂i(F 0iλ) − λ (cid:2)∂iF 0i + i e φ∗ (Dµφ) − i e φ (Dµφ)∗(cid:3) = ∂i(F 0iλ) ,

(λ) dr = −Z ∇ · (λ E) dr ,
which is the electric charge for λ = −1, where Ei = −F0i is the electric ﬁeld.

Q(λ) =Z J 0

VII. CHARGED SCALAR PARTICLE UNDER EXTERNAL ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS

The Lagrangian density is the same as in Eq. (62), omitting the free electromagnetic ﬁeld contribution, but retaining

the interaction terms,

L = (∂µφ∗ − i e Aµ φ∗)(∂µφ + i e Aµ φ) − m2φ∗φ .

The interpretation is that Aµ is a given external ﬁeld, acting on a test charge. Such problem has implications in
laser-plasma interactions in the quantum relativistic regime [9].

The Noether symmetry condition is given by Eq. (1), since Aµ is not subject to any transformation. The treatment
of the third and second-order in the ﬁeld derivative terms yields the results already shown in Eqs. (42)-(44), with the
replacement λ → e λ since now there is the test charge e.

From the ﬁrst and zeroth order in the ﬁeld derivatives terms, the following equations are derived,

16

∂σµ
∂φ

∂σµ

= (cid:16)i e Aν ∂νηµ − ∂µ∂0η0 + i e ∂µλ − i e ην∂νAµ − 2 i e (∂0η0) Aµ(cid:17) φ∗
+ ∂µ ˜φ∗ − i e Aµ ˜φ∗ ,
∂φ∗ = (cid:16)−i e Aν ∂νηµ − ∂µ∂0η0 − i e ∂µλ + i e ην∂νAµ + 2 i e (∂0η0) Aµ(cid:17) φ
∂µσµ = 2(cid:16)− e2 Aµ∂µλ + e2ην (∂νAµ) Aµ + (∂0η0) (e2 AµAµ − m2)(cid:17) φ∗ φ

+ ∂µ ˜φ + i e Aµ ˜φ ,

+ (cid:16)i e Aµ∂µ ˜φ∗ + (e2 AµAµ − m2) ˜φ∗(cid:17) φ
+ (cid:16)−i e Aµ∂µ ˜φ + (e2 AµAµ − m2) ˜φ(cid:17) φ∗ .

From the equality of mixed partial derivatives as shown in Eq. (45), it follows that

allowing to re-express Eqs. (68) and (69) as

ην∂νAµ + 2 (∂0η0) Aµ − Aν ∂νηµ = ∂µλ ,

= − ˜φ∗ ∂µ∂0η0 + ∂µ ˜φ∗ − i e Aµ ˜φ∗ ,

∂σµ
∂φ
∂σµ
∂φ∗ = − ˜φ ∂µ∂0η0 + ∂µ ˜φ + i e Aµ ˜φ ,

(68)

(69)

(70)

(71)

which has the solution

σµ = −(∂µ∂0η0) φ∗ φ + (∂µ ˜φ∗ − i e Aµ ˜φ∗) φ + (∂µ ˜φ + i e Aµ ˜φ) φ∗ + ˜σµ(x) ,

(72)

where ˜σµ(x) does not depend on φ, φ∗.

Plugging σµ from Eq. (72) into Eq. (70) and considering the terms linear in φ∗ and φ, the results are

(cid:16)∂µ∂µ + 2 i e Aµ∂µ + i e ∂µAµ − (e2 AµAµ − m2)(cid:17) ˜φ = 0 ,
(cid:16)∂µ∂µ − 2 i e Aµ∂µ − i e ∂µAµ − (e2 AµAµ − m2)(cid:17) ˜φ∗ = 0 ,

which are the Klein-Gordon equations obeyed by ˜φ, ˜φ∗. Therefore, the addition of particular solutions is an allowable
Noether symmetry, reﬂecting the linearity of the problem. On the same trend, the independent term (not containing
φ or φ∗) gives ∂µ ˜σµ = 0, so that ˜σµ = 0 without loss of generality.

In the continuation, the term proportional to φ∗φ in Eq. (70), taking into account Eq. (72), gives

(cid:16)∂µ∂µ + 2 (e2 AµAµ − m2)(cid:17) ∂0η0 + 2 e2ην (∂ν Aµ) Aµ − 2 e2 Aµ∂µλ = 0 .

Using Eq. (71), the last equation can be reshaped as

(cid:16)∂µ∂µ − 2 (e2 AµAµ + m2)(cid:17) ∂0η0 + 2 e2 AµAν ∂νηµ = 0 ,

where the gauge function λ was eliminated. From the identities shown in Eqs. (42) and (42), it is possible to prove
that AµAµ ∂0η0 = AµAν ∂νηµ = 0, so that

(cid:16)∂µ∂µ − 2 m2(cid:17) ∂0η0 = 0 .

17

We have already meet the same equation, see Eq. (58). Following the same procedure as before, we obtain ∂0η0 = 0,
which in turn imply ∂µην + ∂νηµ = 0, showing that the symmetry transformations constitute the Poincar´e group.
In comparison, the symmetry treatment of non-relativistic charged particle motion under external electromagnetic
ﬁelds, including magnetic monopoles, is compatible with much more general transformations of the time variable
[2–4]. In the relativistic case, the space and time variables entanglement allows only linear coordinate transformations
as determined by the Poincar´e generators.

The external ﬁelds are not arbitrary. According to Eq. (71), they satisfy

for some function λ. In other words,

ην∂νAµ − Aν ∂νηµ = ∂µλ ,

which is the same as

where

ην(∂ν Aµ − ∂µAν ) = ∂µ(λ − ηνAν ) + (∂µην + ∂νηµ) Aν ,

ην Fνµ = ∂µ˜λ ,

(73)

is a redeﬁned arbitrary function. Equation (73) is in a manifestly covariant form. The last requirement is the
veriﬁcation of the homogeneous Maxwell equations,

˜λ = λ − ηµAµ

∂µFνα + ∂ν Fαµ + ∂αFµν = 0 .

A. Examples

It is worthwhile to consider illustrations of the compact equation (73).

1. Time-translations

Supposing time-translations, one has λ0 = 1, λi = 0. In this case, it is a simple matter to verify that Eq. (73) implies
an electric ﬁeld E = ∇˜λ, where ˜λ = ˜λ(r) is time-independent. Finally, Faraday’s law shows that the magnetic-ﬁeld is
also time-independent.

2. Space-translations

For translations along a particular axis (say, the z−direction), one has η0 = η1 = η2 = 0, η3 = 1. In this case,

applying the symmetry condition (73), one has the electromagnetic ﬁeld components

where ∂3˜λ = 0. Moreover, from the homogeneous Maxwell’s equations it is found that ∂3E1 = ∂3E2 = ∂3B3 = 0.

B1 = F32 = ∂2˜λ , B2 = F13 = −∂1˜λ , E3 = F30 = −∂0˜λ ,

3. Circularly Polarized Electromagnetic Field

In an inverse approach, one might consider ﬁrst the electromagnetic conﬁguration, and then ask about Noether

symmetries plugging the ﬁeld into Eq. (73). For instance, for the right circularly polarized wave one has

A =

C0√2

(ǫ eiθ + ǫ

∗e−iθ) , A0 = 0 ,

where ω, k are constants and C0 is a slowly varying function of the phase

while ǫ = (ˆx− iˆy)/√2 denotes the polarization vector, with the unit vectors ˆx, ˆy perpendicular to the direction of light
propagation. It is a simple matter to verify that the circularly polarized ﬁeld admits Noether symmetries, satisfying
Eq. (73) with η0 = k, η1 = η2 = 0, η3 = ω, together with ˜λ = 0. In this case, it should be noticed that this is not the
unique solution to the system provided by Eq. (73).

θ = kz − ωt ,

4. Homogenous Static Magnetic Field

As a ﬁnal example, let us suppose an homogeneous static magnetic ﬁeld

B = B0 ˆz ,

where B0 is a non-zero constant. What are the allowable electric ﬁelds, so that Noether symmetry exist?

From Faradays law, one has ∇ × E = 0, so that E = −∇ A0, where A0 is the scalar potential. Therefore,
Fi0 = −∂iA0. Moreover, for our magnetic ﬁeld we have F12 = −B0, F23 = F31 = 0. The Noether symmetry condition
(73) reduces to four equations. For simplicity, limiting ourselves to the case η0 = 0, these equations are given by

18

ηi∂iA0 = ∂˜λ/∂t ,
η2B0 = ∂˜λ/∂x ,
−η1B0 = ∂˜λ/∂y ,
0 = ∂˜λ/∂z .

Since η0 = 0 implies a0 = 0, R0i = 0, the general solution for Eqs. (75) and (76) is

˜λ = B0(a1y − a2x) +

1
2

B0R12(x2 + y2) − B0z(R23x + R31y) + g(z, t) ,

(74)

(75)

(76)

(77)

(78)

for some function g(z, t). In view of Eq. (77), from Eq. (78) we conclude that R23 = R31 = 0, and that g = g(t).
Finally, Eq. (74) gives

(a1 + R12y)

Just for simplicity, we will assume a3 = 0. The results with a3 6= 0 are easily reachable, although of a less readable
form.
There are two classes of solutions for Eq. (79) with a3 = 0. The ﬁrst, for R12 6= 0, can be more simply written
taking R12 = 1 and a1 = a2 = 0 without loss of generality, after a rescaling of g and appropriate space translations,
if necessary. In this case one has

where ˜A0 is an arbitrary function of the indicated arguments. Notice that the electric ﬁeld found from the scalar
potential is a single valued function.

A0 = ˙g arctan(cid:16) y

x(cid:17) + ˜A0(cid:16)px2 + y2, z, t(cid:17) ,

The second class of solutions for Eq. (79) is found for R12 = 0 and is given by

where ˜A0 is an arbitrary function of the indicated arguments and where a1a2 6= 0 was assumed, for simplicity.

B. Conserved Currents for the Charged Scalar Particle under External Electromagnetic Fields

Our conserved current reads

J µ = h(cid:16)Dµφ(cid:17) ∂νφ∗ +(cid:16)Dµφ(cid:17)∗

∂ν φ − δµ

ν Li ην

+ φ∗(cid:16)Dµ ˜φ(cid:17) − ˜φ(cid:16)Dµφ(cid:17)∗

− ˜φ∗(cid:16)Dµφ(cid:17) .

+ i e λhφ(cid:16)Dµφ(cid:17)∗
+ φ(cid:16)Dµ ˜φ(cid:17)∗

− φ∗(cid:16)Dµφ(cid:17)i

There are three components in the current: the external symmetries contribution, associated to ηµ; the internal gauge
symmetries associated to λ; the internal symmetries due to linearity, due to the superposition law for particular
solutions ˜φ, ˜φ∗.

VIII. CONCLUSION

19

Adopting a systematic procedure, it was seen that the incorporation of symmetries requires the addition of adequate
terms to the Lagrangian density. Already in the case of the complex scalar ﬁeld, there is a global gauge symmetry,
which becomes local when coupled to the electromagnetic ﬁeld. In this context, gauge symmetries can be viewed
as rotations in the internal space parametrized by the real and imaginary parts of the ﬁeld [12]. For the vacuum
electromagnetic ﬁeld, we have a local gauge symmetry, which is in accordance with the causality principle. The
accompanying linearity of the equations, is associated with a Noether conserved current not always emphasized in the
literature. It was the main purpose of the present study, to pursue the calculations of Noether symmetries without
ab initio assumptions. Such a procedure was shown to be useful for the clear identiﬁcation of the internal symmetries
due to linearity, in the case of the free theories (real and complex scalar ﬁeld, vacuum Maxwell’s equations). The
conservation laws can be used to check the accuracy of numerical methods. It is expected, that the present systematic
procedure could be more frequently applied, in both relativistic and non-relativistic studies. An example was applied,
for the ﬁrst time, to the case of a charged scalar particle under a general external electromagnetic ﬁeld. The Noether
symmetry condition, in this case, was reduced to the compact system provided by (73), which is manifestly gauge-
invariant.
