ABSTRACT
The observed stellar kinematics of dispersion-supported galaxies are often used to mea-
sure dynamical masses. Recently, several analytical relationships between the stellar
line-of-sight velocity dispersion, the projected (2D) or deprojected (3D) half-light ra-
dius, and the total mass enclosed within the half-light radius, relying on the spherical
Jeans equation, have been proposed. Here, we make use of the APOSTLE cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations of the Local Group to test the validity and accuracy of
such mass estimators for both dispersion and rotation-supported galaxies, for ﬁeld and
satellite galaxies, and for galaxies of varying masses, shapes, and velocity dispersion
anisotropies. We ﬁnd that the mass estimators of Walker et al. and Wolf et al. are able
to recover the masses of dispersion-dominated systems with little systematic bias, but
with a 1σ scatter of 25 and 23 percent, respectively. The error on the estimated mass
is dominated by the impact of the 3D shape of the stellar mass distribution, which
is diﬃcult to constrain observationally. This intrinsic scatter becomes the dominant
source of uncertainty in the masses estimated for galaxies like the dwarf spheroidal
(dSph) satellites of the Milky Way, where the observational errors in their sizes and
velocity dispersions are small. Such scatter also aﬀects the inner density slopes of
dSphs derived from multiple stellar populations, relaxing the signiﬁcance with which
Navarro–Frenk–White proﬁles may be excluded. Finally, we derive a new optimal mass
estimator that removes the residual biases and achieves a statistically signiﬁcant re-
duction in the scatter to 20 percent overall for dispersion-dominated galaxies, allowing
more precise and accurate mass estimates.

1 INTRODUCTION

Obtaining reliable dynamical information lies at the heart
of many fundamental questions in cosmology and galactic
structure. However, in nature we typically only have partial
information about the kinematics of observed systems. Dy-
namical studies are therefore intrinsically underconstrained,
and often require the use of various simplifying assump-
tions. In this study, we are interested in stellar dynamical
systems to which the spherical Jeans equation may be ap-

plied, such as globular clusters, satellite galaxies, and mas-
sive spheroidal galaxies. The use of Jeans analysis to in-
fer the mass distribution of a system whose gravitational
potential is traced by stars is complicated by an impor-
tant degeneracy between the velocity dispersion anisotropy
of the stars, and the total mass proﬁle of the system. The
anisotropy is notoriously diﬃcult to constrain with current
data, and therefore studies based on the application of the
spherical Jeans equation have led to many ambiguous re-
sults. For example, a topic of great interest is whether local
satellite galaxies have central cusps or cores in their central
dark matter distributions. Studies based on Jeans analysis

2 D. J. R. Campbell et al.

are often inconclusive, largely due to the anisotropy degen-
eracy.

An important advance in this subject has been the ap-
plication of simple estimators to infer the dynamical mass
within a sphere of radius equal to the projected (2D) stellar
half-light radius, Re (Walker et al. 2009, 2010), or the depro-
jected (3D) stellar half-light radius, rhalf (Wolf et al. 2010).1
These estimators make use of only two measured quanti-
ties: the stellar line-of-sight velocity dispersion averaged over

the whole galaxy, (cid:104)σlos(cid:105), and the projected half-light radius.

Each estimator can be written in the form,

M(< λ Re) =

µ(cid:104)σlos(cid:105)2Re

G

,

(1)

where M(< r) is the total mass enclosed within a sphere
of radius r. λ and µ are dimensionless parameters, and G
is the gravitational constant. These estimators are derived
from the spherical Jeans equation, which is valid for spheri-
cally symmetric, dispersion-supported, collisionless, station-
ary systems, in dynamical equilibrium, in the absence of
streaming motions. Additional assumptions are applied in
the derivation of each estimator, with the assumptions used
by Walker et al. (2009) being somewhat more restrictive
than those of Wolf et al. (2010). The main ﬁnding of these
studies is that the total mass within a sphere of radius close
to the 2D or 3D stellar half-light radius is minimally sensi-
tive to the assumed form of the stellar velocity dispersion
anisotropy and the shape of the total mass proﬁle (Wolf
et al. 2010 discuss in detail how this relatively tight con-
straint arises).

Walker & Pe˜narrubia (2011) have applied these esti-
mators to apparently distinct stellar subpopulations in the
Fornax and Sculptor dwarf spheroidals (dSphs), and have
argued for the presence of a central core in the dark mat-
ter density proﬁle of these galaxies, with higher conﬁdence
for Sculptor than for Fornax. (However, this result has been
disputed for Sculptor by Strigari et al. 2014.) A further ex-
ample of the applicability of these mass estimators is the
‘too big to fail problem’ of the standard Λ cold dark matter
(ΛCDM) cosmological model (Boylan-Kolchin et al. 2011),
which was predicated on the basis of comparing the circular
velocity curves (Vc(r) =
haloes drawn from the Aquarius (Springel et al. 2008) and
Via Lactea II simulations (Diemand et al. 2008) with the dy-
namical mass within the 3D half-light radius of the brightest
satellites of the Milky Way (MW) according to Wolf et al.
(2010).

(cid:112)GM(< r)/r) of dark matter sub-

While the assumptions that underpin the spherical
Jeans equation may seem relatively benign, they are not
exactly satisﬁed by all dSphs. For example, it is clear that
many galaxies, such as Fornax, are not spherically symmet-
ric. It also seems unlikely that satellites orbiting in the po-
tential well of a host halo are in dynamical equilibrium.

The simple mass estimators have been tested on ideal
spherically symmetric systems (Walker & Pe˜narrubia 2011),
simulations of ideal dSphs in a static MW potential (Kowal-
czyk et al. 2013), stellar distributions placed in subhaloes
from dark matter only simulations (Laporte et al. 2013a),

and cosmological zoom simulations of
isolated elliptical
galaxies (Lyskova et al. 2015). More recently, the ﬁrst gen-
eration of simulations with enough resolution to model the
satellite galaxies of the MW reliably, in a realistic cosmo-
logical setting, have become available (Grand et al. 2015;
Sawala et al. 2016; Wetzel et al. 2016). Such simulations can
be used to test the accuracy of equation (1) in estimating the
dynamical masses of model galaxies with realistic properties.
In this paper, we make use of the APOSTLE simulations of
the Local Group (Fattahi et al. 2015; Sawala et al. 2016)
to study the accuracy of the estimators proposed by Walker
et al. (2009) and Wolf et al. (2010).

In Section 2 we describe the mass estimators and the
assumptions on which they are based in greater detail. The
simulations used in this work are discussed in Section 3. In
Section 4 we present general properties of a sample of well-
resolved dispersion-dominated galaxies drawn from the sim-
ulations, to which we apply the mass estimators in Section 5.
The implications of the systematic errors on the estimated
masses are discussed in Section 6. In Section 7 we ﬁnd the
set of estimator parameters that optimises the accuracy of
the recovered mass for dispersion-dominated galaxies. Con-
cluding remarks are given in Section 8. In Appendix A we
investigate the accuracy of the estimator of Wolf et al. (2010)
when written in terms of the 3D half-light radius. All sim-
ulation results presented in this paper are at redshift zero.
The assumed ΛCDM cosmological parameters are given in
Section 3.1.

2 MASS ESTIMATORS

The spherical Jeans equation relates the circular velocity
curve of a spherically symmetric system to the radial dis-
tribution and velocity dispersion of a population of tracers
that orbit in the gravitational potential (see Section 1 for a
list of the assumptions on which this equation is based):

where M(< r) is the total mass enclosed within a radius r

lation,2 σr(r) is the proﬁle of its velocity dispersion, in the
radial direction, and β (r) is the tracer velocity dispersion
anisotropy, which encodes the balance between the tangen-
tial and radial components of the velocity dispersion. At a

tion, or indeed, the mass (or luminosity) density proﬁle, provided
that all tracers have the same mass (or luminosity).

MNRAS 000, 1–21 (2016)

When applied to a dSph galaxy, for example, equa-
tion (2) relates the total mass proﬁle to the spatial distri-
bution and kinematics of stars orbiting in the total gravi-
tational potential (which is dominated by the dark matter).
For an observed galaxy, we can measure the projected stellar
density, Σ(R), and velocity dispersion along the line of sight,3
σlos(R). A deprojection is required to map these observable
proﬁles onto the 3D proﬁles that appear on the right-hand-
side of equation (2). The projected and 3D stellar density
proﬁles, Σ(R) and ρ(r), under the assumption of spherical
symmetry, are related by an Abel transform,

Given only line-of-sight kinematic data for the stars, there

In this way, our ignorance of β (r) inﬂuences both the de-
projection of σlos(R) onto σr(r) in equation (6), and the sub-
sequent inference of the enclosed mass proﬁle from equa-
tion (2).

In order to make progress, some assumption about the
stellar velocity dispersion anisotropy is required, ranging
from assuming isotropy (β = 0), to exploring a wide range
of plausible forms for β (r) in the ﬁtting procedure (e.g. Wolf
et al. 2010).

Through Jeans analysis of eight of the brightest dSphs
of the MW, assuming constant β , Walker et al. (2009, 2010)
ﬁnd that the total mass within a sphere of radius equal to
the projected stellar half-light radius (eﬀective radius), Re, is
relatively well constrained (compared to smaller and larger
radii), and seemingly robust against the choice of β , and
of the assumed shape of the total density proﬁle (see also
Strigari et al. 2007, 2008; Pe˜narrubia et al. 2008a,b; Wolf
et al. 2010; Amorisco & Evans 2011). Assuming that the
stars follow a Plummer density proﬁle, with a constant and
isotropic velocity dispersion, Walker et al. (2009) propose a
simple estimator for the total mass enclosed within a sphere
of radius Re, which arises immediately from equation (2)
given these additional assumptions,

M(< Re) =
where (cid:104)σlos(cid:105) is the (assumed to be constant) line-of-sight

stellar velocity dispersion averaged over the whole galaxy.
That is, a constraint on the dynamical mass (or equivalently,
a point on the circular velocity curve) can be obtained using
only the stellar half-light radius and a single value for the
stellar velocity dispersion, which does not require spatially
resolved kinematic data.

Wolf et al. (2010), on the other hand, argue that the 3D
radius within which the sensitivity of the enclosed mass to β
is minimized is in fact r3, the radius at which the logarithmic
slope of the stellar density proﬁle, dlogρ(r)/dlogr, equals

M(< rhalf) =
where they stress that (cid:104)σlos(cid:105) must be the luminosity-
weighted mean dispersion. This estimator is based on the
assumption that σlos(R) remains relatively ﬂat from the cen-
tre of the system out to beyond Re, and that β (r) does not
have an extremum within the stellar distribution. To express
equation (8) entirely in terms of observable quantities, Wolf
et al. (2010) make the further simplifying assumption that
rhalf = 4Re/3, in which case,

This estimator is of the same form as equation (7), but with
λ = 4/3 and µ = 4, compared to λ = 1 and µ = 2.5, in the
notation of equation (1). It is worth noting that if both equa-
tions (7) and (9) apply, then the enclosed dynamical mass
increases by a factor of 1.6 from Re to 4Re/3. We test the
accuracy of equations (7) and (9) using simulated galaxies
in Section 5, and return to equation (8) in Appendix A.

3 SIMULATIONS

We now describe the simulations used in this paper, followed
by the deﬁnitions employed for subhaloes and galaxies, and
the resolution limit we impose to ensure converged galaxy
properties.

3.1 APOSTLE simulations

The APOSTLE simulations use the ‘zoom’ technique to res-
imulate 12 systems consistent with observational constraints
on the properties of the Local Group, as described in more
detail by Fattahi et al. (2015) and Sawala et al. (2016). The
regions were selected from a dark matter only simulation
of a cosmologically representative volume of comoving side
100 Mpc, using ΛCDM parameters consistent with WMAP7
(Komatsu et al. 2011). The density parameters at redshift
zero are Ωm = 0.272 (matter), Ωb = 0.0455 (baryons), and
ΩΛ = 1 − Ωm = 0.728 (cosmological constant). The present
day Hubble parameter is H0 = 100hkms−1 Mpc−1, with h =
0.704. The linear power spectrum is normalised using σ8 =
0.81 at redshift zero. The spectral index of primordial ﬂuc-
tuations is ns = 0.967. The pairs of MW and M31 analogues
were selected on the basis of their separations, relative ra-
dial and tangential velocities, and halo masses, along with
the recession velocities of outer Local Group members (see
Fattahi et al. 2015 for details).

The 12 regions in the APOSTLE suite were simulated
using the code from the EAGLE project (Crain et al. 2015;
Schaye et al. 2015), at a series of resolution levels, which
we label as LR, MR, and HR, in order of increasing reso-
lution (low, medium, high). Table 1 lists the dark matter
and (initial) gas particle masses in the zoom region at each
resolution level, along with the gravitational force soften-
ing. All regions have been simulated at LR and MR, and
two regions have also been run at HR. The EAGLE code
is a version of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)

The gravitational force is Newtonian on scales larger than 2.8ε.

in diﬀerent simulations at a given resolution level; average values
are quoted here (see Fattahi et al. 2015 for the individual values).

ment (Wiersma et al. 2009b), stellar feedback (Dalla Vecchia
& Schaye 2012), black hole formation and mergers (Rosas-
Guevara et al. 2015), and feedback from active galactic nu-
clei (Booth & Schaye 2009). See Crain et al. (2015) and
Schaye et al. (2015) for full details of the subgrid mod-
els. The hydrodynamics implementation used is anarchy
(Dalla Vecchia in preparation), which uses the conserva-
tive pressure-entropy SPH formulation derived by Hopkins
(2013). See Schaller et al. (2015) for a description of anar-
chy and the impact of the changes with respect to the orig-
inal gadget SPH scheme on galaxy properties in the EA-
GLE simulations. The APOSTLE simulations use the ‘ref-
erence’ EAGLE model parameters as described by Schaye
et al. (2015).

3.2 Halo ﬁnding and galaxy deﬁnition

To identify haloes in the simulations, we ﬁrst make use of the
friends-of-friends (FOF) algorithm, considering only dark
matter particles, with a linking length of 0.2 times the mean
interparticle separation (Davis et al. 1985). Baryonic parti-
cles are assigned to the same FOF group as their nearest
dark matter particle. Each FOF group is then processed us-
ing subfind, which identiﬁes overdense gravitationally self-
bound ‘subhaloes’ (Springel et al. 2001; Dolag et al. 2009).
The position of a subhalo is taken to be that of the particle
with the minimum value of the gravitational potential. The
‘main subhalo’ of a FOF group is that whose such particle
has the lowest potential in the group.4 All other subhaloes
are embedded in the main subhalo (a given particle can be-
long to at most one subhalo). As described by Schaye et al.
(2015), we combine any two subhaloes whose separation is
less than the stellar half-mass radius of either subhalo, for

4 Note that we still refer to this main halo from subfind as a
subhalo, even though it constitutes the main component of the
FOF group. For our purposes, the distinction between the main
subhalo and other subhaloes in a FOF group is not important. It
is typical in the literature to label the galaxy found in the main
subhalo as the ‘central’ galaxy of the FOF group, while other
subhaloes host ‘satellite’ galaxies. However, this nomenclature can
be confusing in some cases, e.g. in the APOSTLE simulations the
MW and M31 analogues can reside in the same FOF group.

separations of at most 3 physical kpc. This ﬁnal adjustment
is designed to absorb a very small number of very low mass
subhaloes that are dominated by a single baryonic particle of
unusually high mass (as a result of exceptional stellar mass
loss to a gas particle, or black hole growth).

We deﬁne a galaxy to be the set of subhalo star par-
ticles within a spherical aperture of radius rgal equal to 15
percent of the virial radius, r200, as measured from the sub-
halo centre.5 For subhaloes where the actual value of r200
is not meaningful, e.g. for the subhalo of a satellite galaxy
embedded in a much larger halo, we adopt the value of r200
obtained using a relation between r200 and the maximum
value of the subhalo circular velocity curve, Vmax, calibrated
using main subhaloes in the EAGLE Ref-L025N0752 simu-
lation.6 In practice, we make use of the directly measured
value of r200 when computing rgal for all main subhaloes, and
for any other subhalo for which r200 is less than the distance
to the furthest subhalo particle. All galaxy properties pre-
sented in this paper are computed using the set of subhalo
star particles within rgal, with the galaxy centre set to that
of its host subhalo. We adopt the rest frame of the centre of
mass of the set of star particles deﬁned in this way.

In each simulation volume, we shall refer to the MW and
M31 analogues as the ‘primary’ galaxies. Galaxies within
300 kpc of the centre of either primary galaxy are labelled as
‘satellites’, and those at larger distances are labelled as ‘ﬁeld’
galaxies. This classiﬁcation is independent of the particular
FOF group in which a galaxy resides.

3.3 Selecting a well-resolved galaxy sample

We assume that the luminosity of a star particle (which rep-
resents a simple stellar population) is proportional to its
mass. In this case, Re is the projected radius that encloses
half the stellar mass, as well as half the total stellar luminos-
ity. Fig. 1 shows Re versus stellar mass, Mstar, for all galaxies
in the APOSTLE simulations that are composed of at least
ten star particles, split by resolution level. The Re values are
averaged from projecting over 1536 evenly distributed lines
of sight for each galaxy, making use of the HEALPix spher-
ical tessellation (G´orski et al. 2005).7 This set of sight-lines
will be exploited throughout this paper.

In the following, we consider all galaxies in the high-
est resolution realisation of each of the 12 APOSTLE re-
gions (10 MR and 2 HR simulations) that are resolved with
at least 1000 star particles. This conservative threshold has
been chosen so that the stellar mass-size relation is con-
verged at each resolution level (see also Schaye et al. 2015).
The vertical lines in Fig. 1 show the minimum Mstar of the
set of galaxies with at least 1000 star particles at each reso-
lution. Note that the masses of star particles vary according
to the level of enrichment of the gas from which they formed,
and the extent of their own mass loss since their birth. There

5 r200 is the radius of the sphere that encloses a mean density
equal to 200 times the critical density of the Universe.
6 Ref-L025N0752 has the highest resolution available in the
EAGLE simulation suite, which is similar to that of the MR
APOSTLE simulations. The assumed cosmological parameters
are slightly diﬀerent to those used in the APOSTLE simulations,
which is not important for our purposes.

4.1 Balance between dispersion and rotational

support

A key assumption underpinning the spherical Jeans equation
is that the system under consideration is supported against
gravitational collapse by dispersion, rather than rotational
or other streaming motion. This clearly is not the case for
galaxies with prominent stellar discs. The importance of ro-
tation in the internal dynamics of a galaxy can be quantiﬁed
by κrot, deﬁned as the fraction of the total stellar kinetic en-
ergy, Kstar, invested in ordered rotation (Sales et al. 2012),

.

For each star particle, i, of mass mi,
jz,i is the component
of its speciﬁc angular momentum in the direction of the to-
tal stellar angular momentum vector, Lstar, and Rxy,i is its
distance from the axis deﬁned by Lstar.

Fig. 2 shows κrot versus Mstar for all galaxies in our sam-
ple (as deﬁned in Section 3.3). It can be seen that the simu-
lations predict a broad range of stellar morphologies, accord-

ing to this kinematic measure. For Mstar (cid:38) 109 M(cid:12), rotation-
dominated galaxies (κrot > 0.5) are slightly more prevalent
than those that are dominated by dispersion (κrot < 0.5).
However, at progressively lower stellar masses, the galaxies
are progressively more likely to be dispersion-dominated. For

Mstar (cid:46) 108 M(cid:12), only a small fraction of galaxies have signif-
icant levels of rotational support. The distributions of κrot
for satellites and ﬁeld galaxies are not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent.
The MR and HR simulations predict similar distributions of
κrot at a given Mstar, over the common mass range explored.
In this paper, our main focus is on galaxies with
dispersion-dominated stellar kinematics,
i.e. those with
κrot < 0.5. The galaxy sample deﬁned in this way includes
70 percent of our full sample.

4.2 Stellar density and kinematic proﬁles

Projected stellar density proﬁles, Σ(R),
for dispersion-
dominated ﬁeld and satellite galaxies in the HR simulations
are shown in Fig. 3, split into bins of stellar mass. The pro-
ﬁles are obtained by projecting over a large number of lines
of sight (as described in Section 3.3), and are stacked for
clarity, showing ﬁeld and satellite galaxies separately. There
is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the proﬁles for ﬁeld and
satellite galaxies in any mass bin. There is a small varia-
tion in the shape of the proﬁles with increasing stellar mass,
such that the stellar density is more centrally concentrated
in the highest mass bin than in the other bins (see dashed
line, which repeats the median proﬁle from the lowest mass
bin). Projected stellar number density proﬁle data for bright
dSphs of the MW are shown alongside the simulation pre-
dictions. The measured proﬁles have been rescaled assuming
the best ﬁtting of either a Plummer or Gaussian density pro-
ﬁle model (with Mstar and Re as free parameters). We ﬁnd
that the data points for Leo I are best described by a Gaus-
sian proﬁle, while the other galaxies shown each prefer a
Plummer proﬁle. The simulation predictions closely trace
the observational data, in which the degree of scatter varies
for each dSph. Thus, we can see that the simulated galaxies
have realistic stellar density distributions.

4 GENERAL GALAXY PROPERTIES

In this section, we select a sample of simulated galaxies
whose stellar kinematics are dominated by dispersion. We
then investigate the basic properties of the galaxies in order
to assess how realistic they are. We present radial proﬁles of
the projected stellar density and line-of-sight velocity disper-
sion for galaxies that are resolved at the highest resolution
level, along with proﬁles of their stellar velocity dispersion
anisotropy. These proﬁles are central to the mapping be-
tween observables and the total 3D mass proﬁle (see equa-
tions 2, 5, and 6), and thus represent the basic dynamical
quantities that enter into the Jeans analysis. We then place
the simulated galaxies in the context of the Local Group
by comparing their stellar masses, projected half-mass radii,
and velocity dispersions with observational data. Finally, we
investigate the degree to which the simulated galaxies are
spherically symmetric and in dynamical equilibrium.

Figure 2. Fraction, κrot, of the stellar kinetic energy invested in ordered rotation (see equation 10) versus stellar mass, Mstar, for all
galaxies in our simulated sample. The galaxies are classiﬁed according to whether they are one of the MW or M31 analogues (primary),
within 300 kpc of either of these (satellite), or located at larger distances (ﬁeld). The symbol shapes indicate the resolution level at which
each galaxy has been simulated (MR or HR). Our dispersion-dominated galaxy sample consists of all galaxies that have κrot < 0.5. The
panel on the right shows the distributions, f (κrot), of κrot for all ﬁeld and satellite galaxies. Each distribution is normalised to have unit
area. The shaded regions show the standard error due to the Poisson noise on each bin count.

The solid lines are the median projected proﬁles obtained from 1536 evenly distributed projections for all galaxies of a given type
(diﬀerent colours; legend in right panel), around which the shaded regions of the same colour indicate the 16th − 84th percentile spread.
Each individual proﬁle is scaled, prior to stacking, by the projected stellar half-mass radius, Re, for that line of sight, and the stellar
mass, Mstar. The shaded regions are not shown below the gravitational softening (see Table 1; in units of the median Re in each panel),
and the median proﬁles are dotted below 2.8 times the softening. The panels show diﬀerent stellar mass ranges, and are labelled with
the number of simulated galaxies they contain. As a visual aid, the median proﬁle for all galaxies in the lowest mass bin is repeated as a
dashed black line in the higher mass bins. The symbols with error bars show data for dSph satellites of the MW, where the data for each
dSph are plotted in the relevant panel for its stellar mass following McConnachie (2012). The data shown are for Carina (Mu˜noz et al.
2006), Draco (Odenkirchen et al. 2001), Fornax (Coleman et al. 2005), Leo I (Smolˇci´c et al. 2007), Sculptor (Battaglia et al. 2008), and
Sextans (Irwin & Hatzidimitriou 1995). The measurements are scaled in the same way as the simulation predictions, assuming either a
Gaussian (Leo I) or Plummer (all others) density proﬁle ﬁt.

projecting over 1536 evenly distributed lines of sight, considering star particles at projected radii between 2.8 times the gravitational
softening (see Table 1) and twice the mean projected stellar half-mass radius of the galaxy. The bin edges are evenly spaced in the
logarithm of R, and the points shown are the linear means of the bin edges. The number of bins used for each galaxy is a function of its
star particle count. Note that the axis limits are diﬀerent for each panel.

median proﬁles are dotted below 2.8 times the softening. The symbols with error bars show data for dSph satellites of the MW, where
the data for each dSph are plotted in the relevant panel for its stellar mass following McConnachie (2012). The proﬁles shown are for
Carina, Fornax, Leo I, Sculptor, and Sextans, as computed by Strigari et al. (2010). The measurements are scaled in the same way as
the simulation predictions, using the half-light radii from McConnachie (2012).

Line-of-sight velocity dispersion proﬁles, σlos(R), are
shown in Fig. 4 for the same set of simulated galaxies.8 These
proﬁles show each galaxy individually, using the median re-
sult from all lines of sight. The proﬁles tend to be quite ﬂat
with radius. The typical dispersions and radial extents of the
galaxies scale closely with Mstar, and there are two particu-

σlos(R) is relatively ﬂat (or even constant). To see the typical

tematic diﬀerences in σlos(R) for ﬁeld and satellite galaxies,
we show scaled versions of these proﬁles in Fig. 5, averaging

Figure 6. Spherically averaged stellar velocity dispersion anisotropy proﬁles, β (r), for dispersion-dominated (κrot < 0.5) ﬁeld and satellite
galaxies in the HR simulations. β (r) is negative for tangentially biased dispersions, zero for isotropy, and positive for radially biased
dispersions (see equation 3). The panels show diﬀerent stellar mass ranges, as labelled. The proﬁles include all star particles between a
radius of 2.8 times the softening (see Table 1) and twice the 3D stellar half-mass radius, rhalf. The bin edges are evenly spaced percentiles
of the radial distribution of the star particles, and the points show the median galactocentric radius of the star particles in each bin. The
number of bins used for a given galaxy depends on how many star particles it has.

there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the two popula-
tions, the median proﬁles are somewhat ﬂatter for ﬁeld than
for satellite galaxies, in the two smaller mass intervals. The
satellites in these panels tend to have relatively high velocity
dispersions in their centres, and relatively low dispersions in
their outer parts, compared with ﬁeld galaxies. The median
proﬁles intersect near the projected half-mass radius. The
data points in Fig. 5 show proﬁles for bright dSphs of the
MW (Strigari et al. 2010). The simulated galaxies reproduce
the ﬂatness in σlos(R) observed for the dSphs.

Fig. 6 shows spherically averaged proﬁles of the veloc-
ity dispersion anisotropy, β (r), deﬁned in equation (3), again
examining the highest resolution dispersion-dominated ﬁeld
and satellite galaxies, split by stellar mass. The galaxies
predominantly have radially biased dispersions (β > 0), and
only a small number of galaxies, which are in the most mas-
sive subset, have β (cid:46) −0.2 at any radius. The proﬁles are

similar in form for ﬁeld galaxies and the satellites, and there
are no obvious distinctions between the two populations, ex-
cept that in the lowest mass bin the ﬁeld galaxies tend to
be slightly more radially biased than the satellites, at both
small and large radii. The anisotropy introduces a key degen-
eracy in Jeans analysis (see Section 2), and the mass estima-
tors of interest here assume either that β (r) is monotonic,
or indeed that β has a negligible impact on the recovered
mass, and so can be assumed to equal zero.

4.3 Galaxy sizes and integrated dispersions

The dynamical mass estimators described in Section 2 make
use of only two measurements: the projected stellar half-
light radius, and the line-of-sight stellar velocity dispersion.
In Fig. 7 we plot these two quantities against stellar mass
for all galaxies in our sample. The simulations predict a rel-

atively tight relationship between (cid:104)σlos(cid:105) and Mstar, while the
relationship between Re and Mstar exhibits a somewhat higher
level of scatter. There is clear convergence between the re-
sults from the two resolution levels, which for the stellar

mass-size relation reﬂects our chosen threshold of 1000 star
particles (see Section 3.3). There is no obvious diﬀerence be-
tween the velocity dispersions or sizes of ﬁeld and satellite
galaxies at a given stellar mass.

Observational data for galaxies within 3 Mpc of the Sun
as compiled by McConnachie (2012) are shown alongside
the simulation predictions in Fig. 7. Given our conservative
limit on the number of star particles required for a galaxy
to be included in our sample, we consider simulated galaxies
down to stellar masses close to that of Sculptor, although
the simulations do contain galaxies as faint as Draco. The
simulation predictions are consistent with the observational
constraints, over the large range in stellar mass shown.

It is apparent in Fig. 7 that the simulations predict
somewhat less scatter in size at ﬁxed stellar mass than seen
in the observational data. The majority of observed galax-
ies, including the Magellanic Clouds and Fornax, lie on the
predicted relation but a substantial fraction are smaller, for
their stellar mass, than the smallest galaxies in the simula-
tions. As shown in Fig. 1, at each resolution level, the stellar
mass-size relation ﬂattens out at low masses, and the min-
imum size scales in the same way as the gravitational soft-
ening (the horizontal arrows show the scale above which the
force is Newtonian, at each resolution). It thus appears that
the resolution in the simulations is not quite high enough to
account for the sizes of all the observed galaxies that have
stellar masses close to those of the smallest resolved galax-
ies in the simulations. However, for our purpose, which is
to test the validity of dynamical mass estimators using the
simulated galaxies, it does not matter if resolution eﬀects
have had a marginal impact on the galaxy sizes, provided
that the galaxies have self-consistent internal dynamics.

4.4 Equilibrium and spherical symmetry

The spherical Jeans equation applies to spherically symmet-
ric systems that are in equilibrium. It is reasonable to expect
that simple mass estimators based on this equation will fail

through the simulations. The galaxies are classiﬁed according to whether they are one of the MW or M31 analogues (primary), within

are plotted as ﬁlled symbols, while rotation-dominated galaxies (κrot > 0.5) are plotted as unﬁlled symbols of the same colour and shape.
Data compiled by McConnachie (2012) for galaxies in this stellar mass range within 3 Mpc of the Sun (excluding the MW and M31) are
shown alongside the simulation predictions (upper left legend). The observed galaxies are categorised as satellites if they are associated
with the MW or M31, otherwise they are classed as ﬁeld galaxies. The error bars indicate the published uncertainties on the radii and
velocity dispersions (where available). We supplement the McConnachie (2012) data with half-light radii for the SMC and LMC from
Subramanian & Subramaniam (2012) and Weinberg & Nikolaev (2001, disc model with no bar) respectively, integrating the published
exponential density proﬁle ﬁts in each case. The labelled points are the 11 ‘classical’ satellites of the MW, along with M32 (which has
an exceptionally large dispersion and small size for its mass), and Andromeda XVI (dispersion value is upper limit; downward arrow).
We assume that the luminosity of a star particle is proportional to its mass, and therefore Re is both the half-mass and half-light radius
for the simulated galaxies.

assumptions.

Figure 8. Stellar energy ratio, γ (upper; see equation 11), and stellar sphericity, s (lower; derived from the reduced inertia tensor as

MW or M31 analogues (primary), within 300 kpc of either of these (satellite), or at larger distances (ﬁeld). The symbol shapes indicate
the resolution level (MR or HR). Dispersion-dominated galaxies (κrot < 0.5) are plotted as ﬁlled symbols, while the symbols are unﬁlled
for rotation-dominated galaxies (κrot > 0.5). The black line in the upper panel shows the running median, (cid:104)γ(cid:105), of the γ values, considering
at most 100 neighbouring galaxies in Mstar for each galaxy. We deﬁne ˜γ as the ratio of γ to this median line for each galaxy, and assume
that galaxies with ˜γ ≈ 1 are in equilibrium. The panels on the right show the distributions of the rescaled energy ratio, f ( ˜γ) (not the
distribution of γ itself), and the sphericity, f (s), on the same vertical scales as the main panels, for only the dispersion-dominated ﬁeld
and satellite galaxies. Each distribution is normalised to have unit area. The shaded regions show the standard error due to the Poisson
noise on each bin count.

the sum of the gravitational potential energy of each star
particle due to the full mass distribution of the subhalo to
which the star particles of the galaxy belong. In computing
Ustar, we shift the zero-point of the potential to coincide with
the galactic centre. Equation (11) is similar in appearance
to the virial ratio for an isolated system. However, γ refers
only to the stellar component, not to the whole dynamical
system, and we measure the potential energy with respect to
the bottom of the potential well. The upper panel of Fig. 8
shows γ versus Mstar for all galaxies in our sample. We con-

sider a galaxy to be out of equilibrium if it has a γ value
substantially higher or lower than the median value for its
stellar mass (black line). We deﬁne ˜γ to be the ratio of γ to
the median line shown for each galaxy.

In order to quantify how close to spherically symmetric
a galaxy is, we compute its stellar sphericity, s, as follows.
We ﬁrst compute the reduced inertia tensor, I, of the star
particles, which projects the mass distribution onto a unit
sphere, so that the shape determination does not depend on
the radial distribution of the particles (e.g. Bett 2012). This

where each star particle, n, has mass mn and is located at
a distance rn from the galactic centre. rn,i and rn, j are the
coordinates of the star particle with respect to the galac-
tic centre, in the i and j directions, respectively. Taking
the eigenvectors of I to be the principal axes of an ellip-
soid, with axis lengths a ≥ b ≥ c given by the square roots
of the eigenvalues of I, the sphericity is s = c/a (a sphere
has s = 1). The lower panel of Fig. 8 shows s versus stellar
mass for all galaxies in our sample. Naturally, the rotation-
dominated galaxies (unﬁlled symbols) tend be more ﬂat-
tened (and thus have lower s) than those that are dispersion-
dominated (ﬁlled symbols). However, there are some galaxies
which are dispersion-dominated according to our kinematic
measure (κrot) that have lower sphericity than the vast ma-
jority of rotation-dominated galaxies. Note that s does not
distinguish between disc-like ﬂattening and elongation, as
this measure takes into account only two of the axes. The
relationship between s and κrot has a large amount of scat-
ter, although the scatter decreases (and s decreases) with in-
creasing κrot. Looking at Fig. 8, it appears that satellites are
preferentially closer to spherical than ﬁeld galaxies (see dis-
tributions in right panel, which consider only the dispersion-
dominated galaxies). This eﬀect is consistent with the expec-
tation for satellite systems that have been tidally stripped
(Barber et al. 2015). The sphericity also increases on average
as stellar mass decreases in Fig. 8.

Given the broad range of 3D shapes and the spread in
energy ratios seen for the simulated galaxies in Fig. 8, there
clearly exist galaxies within our (dispersion-dominated, or
indeed, full) sample for which the assumptions of spheri-
cal symmetry and equilibrium are strongly violated. In the
following, it will be particularly interesting to see how the
simple mass estimators perform when applied to such galax-
ies.

5 ACCURACY OF MASS ESTIMATORS

Having demonstrated that the galaxies in our simulations
have realistic projected stellar density and velocity disper-
sion distributions, with a range of 3D shapes, velocity dis-
persion anisotropies, levels of dispersion support, and depar-
tures from dynamical equilibrium, we now apply the simple
mass estimators proposed by Walker et al. (2009) and Wolf
et al. (2010) in order to assess their accuracy as a function
of various galaxy properties.

For convenience, let us denote the ratio of the estimated
mass to the true dynamical mass within some sphere as α.

ple (lower panel), according to the value of κrot (see equation 10).
Diﬀerent colours show the distributions obtained using the Walker
et al. (2009, αWalker) and Wolf et al. (2010, αWolf) estimators, as

estimator and the dotted lines the 10th and 90th percentiles. The
standard deviation, σ , of each distribution is given in the same
colour as the lines. The shaded regions around the vertical lines

and the quoted errors on σ are the 16th − 84th percentile conﬁ-
dence limits, derived from 104 bootstrap samples of the galaxies
for each distribution. Each projection of each galaxy contributes
to the relevant distribution with equal weight, and each distri-
bution is normalised to have unit area. The panels are labelled
with the number of galaxies they include. We highlight that the
f (α) axis limits used in Figs. 10, 11, and 15 vary with respect to
those used here, in order to optimise the clarity of each individual
ﬁgure.

We emphasize that in both equations (13) and (14), the de-
nominator is the total mass within a sphere of radius propor-
tional to the value of Re obtained for a given line of sight. For
each galaxy in our sample, we measure Re, (cid:104)σlos(cid:105), M(< Re),
and M(< 4Re/3) for 1536 evenly distributed lines of sight.
The masses are obtained from all subhalo particles within
the relevant radius, including the contributions from dark
matter, gas, stars, and black holes, where present.

nent stellar discs (for which we would not expect an observer
to use such an estimator). Fig. 9 shows the distributions of
α values obtained by applying both estimators to all projec-
tions of every galaxy, split according to whether the stellar
motions within the galaxy are dominated by dispersion or
ordered rotation (see Section 4.1).

For both kinematic regimes, each estimator has a bias
in the median of no more than 5 percent (dashed lines),
accompanied by a large scatter (see dotted lines and stan-
dard deviation values). It is interesting that there is no dra-
matic change in the accuracy of the estimators, in the me-
dian, when switching from the dispersion-dominated to the
rotation-dominated galaxies. For each sample, the two diﬀer-
ent estimators have a similar level of scatter, which is larger
for the rotation-dominated galaxies. In general, the distribu-
tions are very similar in shape for the two estimators; how-
ever, the Wolf et al. (2010) estimator has a smaller median
oﬀset, 10th to 90th percentile spread, and standard devia-
tion than the Walker et al. (2009) estimator, for both galaxy
samples (although the diﬀerence in the scatter is much less
signiﬁcant for the rotation-dominated galaxies). The α dis-
tributions for the dispersion-dominated galaxies are approx-
imately symmetric around the median, but the shape of the
distributions is more complicated in the rotation-dominated
case, where the peaks are above α = 1, and there are ex-
tended tails to low α.

Overall, there is a 1σ scatter for dispersion-dominated
galaxies of 25 percent when using the estimator of Walker
et al. (2009), and 23 percent for the estimator of Wolf et al.
(2010). In the following, we shall investigate the dependence
of the α distributions for dispersion-dominated galaxies on
key quantities that characterise the properties of each galaxy
and are most relevant to the assumptions on which the mass
estimators are based.

5.2 Stellar velocity dispersion anisotropy
The anisotropy, β , of the stellar velocity dispersion is an
important parameter in the Jeans analysis. An important
feature of the mass estimators of interest here is that they
are designed to be minimally sensitive to β . In Fig. 10(a), we
show the α distributions for dispersion-dominated galaxies,
split into bins of (cid:104)β(cid:105), which is the stellar velocity dispersion
The stellar orbits are predominantly radially biased ((cid:104)β(cid:105) >
0); there are only 46 out of 250 galaxies with (cid:104)β(cid:105) < 0 (see
Fig. 6 for the radial variation of β in the HR simulations).
For each estimator, the scatter in α increases with (cid:104)β(cid:105), where
radially biased systems, for the (cid:104)β(cid:105) intervals shown.

the diﬀerence is greatest between the intermediate and most

anisotropy averaged over the whole galaxy (see equation 3).

average, the galaxies in our full sample are in equilibrium; see
Fig. 8). The α distributions for dispersion-dominated galax-
ies divided into bins of ˜γ are shown in Fig. 10(b), where
galaxies in the intermediate bin are taken to be close to
equilibrium. The scatter in α actually increases with ˜γ, such
that the lowest ˜γ interval exhibits the smallest scatter for
each estimator.

5.4 Shape

As shown in Fig. 8, the simulated galaxies span a broad
range of 3D shapes. Fig. 10(c) shows the α distributions
for dispersion-dominated galaxies divided into bins of stel-
lar sphericity, s. The scatter in α diminishes sharply as the
stellar mass distribution tends towards spherical symmetry
(s = 1). This behaviour is consistent with the expectation
for the applicability of the spherical Jeans equation. Clearly,
the estimators perform relatively well for galaxies that are
close to spherical. However, robustly identifying such sys-
tems from projected data alone is non-trivial.

We now investigate the impact of carrying out the shape
determination in projection. Adapting the procedure de-
scribed in Section 4.4 for computing sphericity, we compute
the reduced inertia tensor in 2D using the projected coordi-
nates of each star particle on the sky; the resulting ellipse
axis lengths, ap ≥ bp, are then used to deﬁne the stellar circu-
larity as sp = bp/ap (a circle has sp = 1). Fig. 10(d) shows the
α distributions in bins of circularity, where we see a much
weaker trend in the scatter as a function of shape than when
the full 3D information of Fig. 10(c) is used. As such, the
scatter in α for galaxies that appear to be very close to cir-
cular on the sky (sp > 0.9) is signiﬁcantly larger than for
galaxies that are actually close to spherical in 3D (s > 0.75).

5.5 Stellar mass

The simple mass estimators could be expected to work
equally well for stellar systems on any mass scale, provided
that they satisfy the spherical Jeans equation and that more
detailed assumptions relating to the stellar density distribu-
tion and the stellar velocity dispersion are reasonable (see
Section 2). However, many galaxy properties scale with stel-
lar mass, which for our simulated galaxies, albeit weakly
and with a large scatter, include the level of rotational sup-
port and the 3D shape (see Figs. 2 and 8). In Fig. 10(e) we
show the α distributions for dispersion-dominated galaxies
in bins of stellar mass. There is no monotonic global trend
in the scatter in α as a function of stellar mass; however, for
both estimators the scatter peaks in the intermediate mass
interval.

5.3 Equilibrium

In order to assess how the accuracy of the mass estimators
depends on whether the galaxy of interest is in equilibrium,
as assumed in the derivation of each estimator, we make
use of ˜γ as deﬁned in Section 4.4. This encodes the balance
between the total stellar kinetic energy and the potential
energy measured with respect to the bottom of the gravita-

tional potential well, where galaxies with ˜γ ≈ 1 are assumed
to be in equilibrium (the calculation of ˜γ assumes that, on

5.6 Field versus satellite galaxies
Fig. 11 shows the α distributions separately for dispersion-
dominated ﬁeld and satellite galaxies (satellites are within
300 kpc of a MW or M31 analogue). Although there are
fewer satellites, and hence poorer statistics, the scatter in α
is smaller for the satellite galaxies than for the ﬁeld galaxies,
for both estimators. This may be closely related to the fact
that, on average, the satellite galaxies are closer to spherical
symmetry than those in the ﬁeld (see Fig. 8). There are hints

that the satellites also tend to be more strongly supported
by dispersion (see Fig. 2) and tend to have stellar velocity
dispersions that are closer to isotropic (see Fig. 6 for HR),
compared with ﬁeld galaxies.

5.7 Summary and discussion
To summarise the preceding results, Fig. 12 shows α for each
estimator as a function of various galaxy properties, in bins
of approximately equal numbers of galaxies (or sight-lines).
The ﬁrst panel shows the dependence on κrot for the full
galaxy sample, and the subsequent panels consider only the
dispersion-dominated galaxies (κrot < 0.5). The distinction
between the two estimators is small, although where they
deviate, the Wolf et al. (2010) estimator has the smallest
bias and scatter in almost all cases.

Considering the scatter, the estimators are most precise
for dispersion supported galaxies that are close to spherical,
have at most mildly radially biased stellar velocity disper-

sions ((cid:104)β(cid:105) (cid:46) 0.2), and have relatively low stellar kinetic en-

ergy for their gravitational potential energy. The strongest
dependence of the scatter is on the 3D shape of the stellar
mass distribution, of which almost all useful information is
lost in projection. We note that the main physical galaxy
properties of interest are related at some level: galaxies that
are close to spherical tend to have velocity dispersions that

are close to isotropic and have relatively little ordered rota-
tion.

Any trends in the median α values are weak. However,
considering the dependence on circularity, the bias towards
overestimation of the mass for galaxies that are very elon-
gated on the sky gradually decreases with increasing cir-
cularity (we note that this trend is exaggerated if we in-
stead consider the full galaxy sample, including the rotation-
dominated galaxies). The median α also exhibits an increase
with increasing ˜γ.

We note that Kowalczyk et al. (2013) apply a modiﬁed
version of the estimator of Wolf et al. (2010) to idealised sim-
ulations of dSphs in a static MW potential, and ﬁnd that the
error decreases as the shape of the stellar mass distribution
tends towards spherical symmetry. However, they also ﬁnd
that for the simulated dSphs there is no clear dependence of
the error on the level of ordered stellar rotation or velocity
dispersion anisotropy. Laporte et al. (2013a) investigate the
accuracy of the Walker et al. (2009) estimator for idealised
stellar distributions placed in dark matter subhaloes from
the Aquarius simulations, ﬁnding ﬂuctuations of between 10
and 20 percent with respect to the true mass. Lyskova et al.
(2015) apply the Wolf et al. (2010) estimator to cosmological
zoom simulations of 40 isolated elliptical galaxies, ﬁnding a
1σ scatter of around 8 percent for Vc(4Re/3) (note that the
fractional error on Vc(r) is half that on M(< r), assuming zero
error on the radius), with a bias of 3 percent above the true
circular velocity. Our results complement these earlier stud-
ies, but we have used a large sample of realistic galaxies with
a broad range of stellar masses, formed in a self-consistent
ΛCDM cosmological context, in the environment of the Lo-
cal Group, using sophisticated treatments of the baryonic
physics important to galaxy formation.

6 EFFECTS OF UNCERTAINTIES

We now explore the impact of the systematic uncertainties
associated with the simple mass estimators on key results in
the literature that are based on applying the estimators to
observational data. Despite the high resolution of the APOS-
TLE simulations, our sample of galaxies does not include
systems with stellar masses smaller than that of Sculptor
(due to our chosen resolution threshold; see Section 3.3 and
Fig. 7). However, the estimator error has no clear depen-
dence on stellar mass (see Fig. 10e). Therefore, we assume
that the uncertainties explored in Section 5 remain relevant
for galaxies that are fainter than those in our sample.

6.1 Dynamical masses of MW dSphs

Wolf et al. (2010) ﬁnd that simply propagating the obser-
vational errors on the half-light radius and the line-of-sight
velocity dispersion through their estimator equation yields
a similar uncertainty for the estimated dynamical mass to
that obtained from their full Jeans analysis (which, like the
estimator, assumes spherical symmetry). The authors argue
that this is consistent with their claim that the uncertainty
on the recovered mass is dominated by observational errors,
rather than underlying systematic eﬀects. However, as we
have demonstrated, the estimator’s precision is sensitive to
various properties of the target galaxy.

αWolf), by projecting over 1536 evenly distributed lines of sight, as a function of various galaxy properties. The properties shown are:
the fraction of stellar kinetic energy invested in ordered rotation (κrot), mean stellar velocity dispersion anisotropy ((cid:104)β(cid:105)), the equilibrium
measure ( ˜γ), stellar sphericity (s), projected stellar circularity (sp), and stellar mass (Mstar). The ﬁrst panel shows α versus κrot for all
galaxies; all other panels consider only those galaxies whose stellar motions are dominated by dispersion (κrot < 0.5). For each estimator
(colours), the solid lines show the median mass ratios and the shaded regions the 16th − 84th percentile spread. The bin edges are evenly

spaced percentiles of the quantity on the horizontal axis, and the bin centres (points) are the median values in each bin.

To illustrate the signiﬁcance of the systematic error
on the estimated mass, Table 2 lists the mass within the
3D half-light radius for dSphs of the MW, which we com-
pute using equation (9), given the projected half-light radius
and line-of-sight velocity dispersion values tabulated by Wolf
et al. (2010).9 For each galaxy, we list the 1σ fractional er-
ror, σM, on the estimated mass, obtained by propagating the
observational errors through equation (9), as advocated by
Wolf et al. (2010). The ﬁnal column gives the fractional error
on the mass if, in addition, we add in quadrature a repre-
sentative 1σ systematic error of 20 percent in the estimated
to true mass ratio. This ﬁducial value for the scatter is ap-
propriate on average for the dispersion-dominated satellite
galaxies in the simulations (see Fig. 11), or all dispersion-
dominated galaxies that appear near-circular on the sky (see
Fig. 10d). For many of the bright satellites, the observational
errors on the measured quantities are suﬃciently small that
the increase in the overall mass error due to including the
representative systematic uncertainty is similar in size to the
original mass error. However, in many other cases the origi-

half-light radius from their full Jeans analysis, rather than from
their estimator.

nal error is so large that the contribution from the systematic
uncertainty is relatively insigniﬁcant.

6.2 Density proﬁles of Sculptor and Fornax

Walker & Pe˜narrubia (2011) employ a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) technique to infer projected half-light radii
and velocity dispersions for chemo-dynamically distinct stel-
lar subpopulations in the Sculptor and Fornax dSphs. In
each galaxy there is a centrally concentrated, kinematically
cold, metal-rich stellar component (population 1), and a
more extended, metal-poor component, with higher velocity
dispersion (population 2). The procedure used by Walker
& Pe˜narrubia (2011) treats each galaxy as a superposition
of two spherically symmetric stellar populations (each de-
scribed by a Plummer proﬁle), with Gaussian velocity and
metallicity distributions. Assuming that the two popula-
tions independently trace the gravitational potential, the
resulting size and dispersion values deﬁne a mass slope,
Γ = ∆logM(< r)/∆logr, using equation (1), where the ac-
tual values of λ and µ are not relevant for computing the
slope:

mates have been computed using the projected half-light radii, Re

systematic errors explored in this paper, the ﬁnal column gives

Here r1 and r2 are 3D radii equal to (or some multiple of)

and σ1 and σ2 are the mean velocity dispersions, (cid:104)σlos(cid:105), of
each population, respectively. Building a posterior probabil-
ity distribution function, P(Γ), using the set of r1, r2, σ1,

A measurement of Γ using the masses enclosed at two
non-zero radii places an upper limit on the inner logarith-
mic slope, γDM, of the dark matter density proﬁle, such that
γDM < 3− Γ. Given that γDM = 1 for an NFW density pro-
ﬁle (Navarro et al. 1996), while e.g. γDM = 0 for a constant
density core, Walker & Pe˜narrubia (2011) exclude NFW (or
steeper) proﬁles with conﬁdence of (at least) 95.9 and 99.8
percent for Fornax and Sculptor respectively. These signiﬁ-
cance values, s(γDM), are computed as,

(2011), we begin by creating a simple model of their analy-
sis procedure. Approximating the published posterior prob-
ability distribution functions for log10(r2), r1/r2, log10(σ 2
1 ),
and log10(σ 2
2 ) as Gaussian (using the tabulated medians and
16th − 84th percentile ranges), we generate 106 values for
Γ by independently drawing random values consistent with
the four distributions, and applying equation (15). This ap-
proach ignores the correlations between the free parameters
of the system, which are accounted for in the MCMC chains.
However, the resulting P(Γ) distributions for the two dSphs,
shown in the upper panel of Fig. 13, are very similar to those
obtained by Walker & Pe˜narrubia (2011, cf. their ﬁg. 10).
Indeed, our median values for the slopes of Γ = 2.54+0.44
−0.37 for
Fornax and Γ = 2.96+0.49
−0.39 for Sculptor are in excellent agree-
ment with their results.
Assuming that the two stellar populations are indepen-
dent, such that the systematic errors associated with ap-
plying a simple mass estimator to either population are un-
correlated, we show in the lower panel of Fig. 13 the result
of including a representative 1σ fractional systematic error

of σsys = 0.2 in the mass estimates for both populations.
In detail, we repeat the process described above, but for
each set of radii and dispersions, we multiply M(< r1) and
M(< r2) (or equivalently, the squared dispersions) by ran-
dom values, E1 and E2, respectively, drawn separately from
a Gaussian distribution centred at one with standard devi-
ation σsys, and then proceed to apply equation (15) as be-
fore.10 Including the systematic scatter spreads out the P(Γ)
distributions, with a negligible impact on the median values,
giving Γ = 2.54+0.77
−0.61 for Sculptor.
In terms of the signiﬁcance as deﬁned in equation (16), the
P(Γ) distributions including the systematic error disfavour
NFW slopes with conﬁdence of only 77.7 and 94.5 percent
for Fornax and Sculptor respectively. Note that as neither
Sculptor nor Fornax is close to being circularly symmetric
on the sky, they are clearly not spherically symmetric, and
so the systematic dispersion in the mass estimates may be
somewhat higher than 20 percent, which would further in-
crease the uncertainties on the mass slopes. Clearly, the sys-
tematic errors associated with mass estimators of the form
given in equation (1) signiﬁcantly reduce the conﬁdence with
which it can be claimed that the results of Walker & Pe˜nar-
rubia (2011) rule out the presence of dark matter cusps as
steep as that of the NFW proﬁle in Fornax and Sculptor.

The choice of σsys = 0.2 above seems reasonable given
our analysis of the uncertainties involved in estimating the
dynamical masses of realistic simulated galaxies in Section 5.
However, we are ignorant of any underlying correlations be-
tween the properties of the dual populations in Sculptor or
Fornax that may conspire to bias the estimated enclosed
masses in a similar way for the two radii, thus reducing the
error on the slope.

Laporte et al. (2013a) generate stellar distribution func-
tions in dark matter subhaloes drawn from the Aquarius
simulations, in order to assess the sensitivity of the accu-
racy of the dual population method of Walker & Pe˜narrubia
(2011) to the triaxiality of the gravitational potential (i.e.
the lack of spherical symmetry in the dark matter distribu-
tion). The lack of symmetry tends to introduce an anticorre-

lation between Re and (cid:104)σlos(cid:105) that suppresses the error on the

recovered mass (see also Section A2). Laporte et al. (2013a)
therefore argue that the level of spherical symmetry is not
important to the estimator accuracy, despite the fact that
they obtain ﬂuctuations of between 10 and 20 percent for
the estimated masses (cf. Fig. 12). These authors ﬁnd, as
in the spherically symmetric tests of Walker & Pe˜narrubia
(2011), that Γ tends to be systematically underestimated,
and thus the exclusions of NFW proﬁles in Sculptor and
Fornax are conservative (i.e. the results for Γ can be consid-
ered as reliable lower limits). This is because the mass tends
to be more strongly overestimated for tracers that are more
deeply embedded. An important aspect of these tests, which
use idealised independent stellar distributions placed in re-
alistic dark matter haloes, is that the shapes (equidensity
surfaces) of the stellar populations exactly trace the gravita-
tional potential, and so the shapes of any two stellar popula-
tions generated in this way are inherently closely correlated,

cially small errors on the recovered mass slope, as it does
not take into account the possibility that the stellar mass
may be distributed in a way that does not exactly follow
the contours in the potential, and that the two populations
may have quite diﬀerent shapes.

Kowalczyk et al. (2013) carry out a similar study to
that of Laporte et al. (2013a), but making use of idealised
simulations of dSph galaxies orbiting in a static MW po-
tential. The galaxies are initialised as perfect stellar discs,
embedded in spherical dark matter subhaloes, with the two
dSph stellar populations assumed to originate from the in-
ner and outer disc. These authors make use of the velocity
dispersion measured within Re when computing Γ, in con-
trast to the method of Walker & Pe˜narrubia (2011), which
uses the dispersion averaged over the whole galaxy.11 They
ﬁnd that Γ can be biased both low and high with respect
to the true slope, depending on the line of sight, and that
the results are most accurate for galaxies that are close to
spherical. If Γ was overestimated for Sculptor or Fornax by
Walker & Pe˜narrubia (2011) then the conﬁdence with which
they exclude an inner NFW slope would be artiﬁcially high.
However, as pointed out by Laporte et al. (2013a), since
Kowalczyk et al. (2013) use the dispersion measured within
Re for each population, this may yield signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
results to the method used by Walker & Pe˜narrubia (2011).
Indeed, Laporte et al. (2013a) demonstrate that if they mea-
sure the dispersion within Re then their analysis using the
Aquarius simulations can also overestimate Γ. Note that in
this case Γ is more accurate (less biased), albeit typically
with a larger scatter; yet this is undesirable in terms of ob-
taining a conservative exclusion conﬁdence for NFW proﬁles.
A deeper understanding of the uncertainties associated
with the methodology of Walker & Pe˜narrubia (2011) will
come from high resolution simulations where the chemo-
dynamically distinct stellar populations in dSphs are treated
in a realistic way, ideally as the result of cosmological initial
conditions.

7 AN OPTIMAL ESTIMATOR

The mass estimators discussed in the preceding sections have
a common form, as parameterized in equation (1), where
λ is the 3D radius within which the mass is estimated, in
units of Re, and µ is the estimator prefactor. Extending this
general idea, it may be that the radius within which the
velocity dispersion is measured inﬂuences the accuracy of
the recovered mass. Including an additional dimensionless
parameter, ν, we can write a more ﬂexible generalisation,

µ(cid:104)σlos(< νRe)(cid:105)2Re

,

G

M(< λ Re) =
where (cid:104)σlos(< R)(cid:105) is the line-of-sight stellar velocity disper-
sion measured within a projected radius, R, of the galactic
centre. Up to now, we have averaged the velocity dispersion

(17)

over the whole galaxy (ν → ∞), in keeping with the estima-

tors proposed by Walker et al. (2009) and Wolf et al. (2010).
Setting aside the theoretical motivation for certain

11 Kowalczyk et al. (2013) refer to the estimator they use as that
of Wolf et al. (2010). In fact, Wolf et al. (2010) advocate averaging
the dispersion over all stars belonging to the galaxy.

choices of the parameters in equation (17) which, at least for
the estimators of Walker et al. (2009) and Wolf et al. (2010),
are based on the assumptions that underpin the spheri-
cal Jeans equation combined with additional simpliﬁcations,
we now ask: empirically, for the population of dispersion-
dominated galaxies in our simulations, which set of estimator
parameters yields an unbiased estimate of the true dynami-
cal mass within some radius, with minimum scatter?

Considering our dispersion-dominated galaxy sample,
the upper panel of Fig. 14 shows the standard deviation of
the estimated to true mass ratio, α, for the unbiased esti-
mator obtained by setting µ such that the mean α is one
for a given λ and ν. This grid has been computed by pro-
jecting over 1536 evenly distributed lines of sight, with a
grid spacing of 0.01 in λ and ν. The scatter in the estimates
varies strongly with λ , and depends more weakly on ν. How-
ever, the impact of ν on the scatter becomes more signiﬁcant
near the location of minimum scatter in this plane (diamond
marker). The middle panel in Fig. 14 shows the scatter as a
function of λ for the case where ν is chosen to minimize the
scatter for each value of λ (solid line), and also where the
velocity dispersion averaged over the whole galaxy is used
instead (dashed line). In the case where ν is allowed to vary,
the scatter is minimized for ν ≈ 1, while including the whole
galaxy in the dispersion measurement leads to a preference
for higher λ .

The sets of parameters that minimize the scatter for
these two treatments of ν are given in Table 3, along with
the associated scatter in the α distributions. We shall refer
to the parameters found in the case where ν is allowed to
vary as the ‘optimum’ set. The parameters in the case where
the dispersion is measured within exactly Re is also given in
Table 3 (ν = 1) and yield an equivalent level of scatter as in
the optimum case. The uncertainties on the parameters and
the scatter values given in Table 3 are derived from boot-
strap resampling of the galaxies, where for each constraint
on ν, we draw 104 samples of the same number of galaxies
as in the true sample, and compute the 16th and 84th per-
centiles of the distributions of the parameters and scatter
in α resulting from applying the minimisation procedure to
each sample. Fig. 15 shows the full α distribution in the op-
timum case. The reduction in the minimum scatter due to

The mean α values and associated scatter obtained from
applying the estimators of Walker et al. (2009) and Wolf
et al. (2010) to the same galaxy sample as used in the calibra-
tion are shown in the lower panels of Fig. 14. Both of these
estimators have a slightly smaller scatter than in the unbi-
ased case that uses the dispersion averaged over the whole
galaxy (as these two estimators do), for their λ . Using the
optimum parameter set leads to reductions in the scatter of
18.2 and 9.9 percent relative to the Walker et al. (2009) and
Wolf et al. (2010) versions, respectively, while correcting for
the bias exhibited by each estimator, as shown in Fig. 14.

We note that Amorisco & Evans (2011) obtain an em-
pirical estimator with similar parameters to our optimum
result, from phase-space modelling of the dSphs of the MW

(they ﬁnd λ = 1.7 and µ = 5.8± 1.0; cf. Table 3). The choice
of 1.7Re for the enclosing radius minimizes the dependence
in their analysis of the recovered mass on the assumed halo
density proﬁle and its associated scale length, assuming that

ferent constraints on ν, which sets the radius within which the

8 CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have presented the key intrinsic and ob-
servable properties of galaxies drawn from the APOSTLE
simulations of the Local Group that are relevant to Jeans
analysis in general, and in particular to the use of simple
mass estimators of the form given in equation (1), as advo-
cated by Walker et al. (2009) and Wolf et al. (2010). The
simulated galaxies have realistic stellar density distributions
and line-of-sight stellar velocity dispersions, combined with
a range of 3D shapes, levels of dispersion support, and stellar
velocity dispersion anisotropy.

Applying the mass estimators proposed by Walker et al.
(2009) and Wolf et al. (2010) to many projections of each
galaxy in our sample, we have found that the estimators
each have a small bias in the estimated to true mass ratio,
α, combined with a relatively large scatter. This scatter is 23
or 25 percent at the 1σ level overall for dispersion-dominated
galaxies, respectively.

The scatter in α depends strongly on the shape of the
galaxy, such that the α distributions are sharply peaked for
stellar mass distributions that are close to spherical symme-
try. However, the dependence of the scatter on the observ-
able 2D shape on the sky is much weaker, i.e. it is diﬃcult
to identify ideal spherically symmetric systems in projec-
tion. The scatter also increases for progressively larger radial

12 Amorisco & Evans (2011) state that their analysis makes use
of the velocity dispersion at the galactic centre, however it is
not clear to what level the dispersions used can be considered to
be ‘central’. The dataset used is that compiled by Walker et al.
(2009, 2010), who note that the dispersions are global averages.
Therefore we use the velocity dispersion averaged over the whole
galaxy when applying the estimator of Amorisco & Evans (2011),
in order to be consistent with the data used in their analysis.

bias in the stellar velocity dispersion anisotropy, and pro-
gressively higher levels of rotational support. We also ﬁnd
that the scatter is lowest for galaxies that have relatively
low stellar kinetic energy for their gravitational potential
energy. The dispersion-dominated satellites of the MW and
M31 analogues in the simulations yield a smaller scatter in
α (typically 20–22 percent) than the ﬁeld galaxies (typically
24–26 percent).

Adopting a representative value of 20 percent for the 1σ
systematic scatter in α for satellite galaxies, we have shown
that the systematic uncertainties inherent in the simple es-
timators signiﬁcantly increase the errors on the estimated
dynamical masses of dSph satellites of the MW from Wolf
et al. (2010) in cases where the observational errors on the
half-light radii and velocity dispersions are relatively small.
Including the same representative scatter within a simple
model of the analysis of Walker & Pe˜narrubia (2011) demon-
strates that systematic uncertainties also greatly reduce the
signiﬁcance with which the mass proﬁle slopes derived for
two independent stellar populations in Sculptor and Fornax
are inconsistent with an NFW dark matter density proﬁle.
This result depends on the level to which the mass uncer-
tainties for the two populations can be assumed to be inde-
pendent.

Finally, we have investigated the scatter in the esti-
mated to true mass ratio for the set of unbiased estima-
tors of the form given in equation (17), considering all the
dispersion-dominated galaxies in our simulated sample. We
ﬁnd that using the optimum set of parameters given in Ta-
ble 3 results in a reduction in the scatter of between 10 and
20 percent with respect to similar estimators in the litera-
ture (Walker et al. 2009; Wolf et al. 2010; Amorisco & Evans
2011), combined with the removal of bias in the mean. The
scatter is optimised when the line-of-sight velocity disper-
sion is measured within a radius close to the projected stel-
lar half-mass radius, Re (rather than over the whole galaxy
as is typical):

M(< 1.77Re) =

5.99(cid:104)σlos(< 1.04Re)(cid:105)2Re

G

.

(18)

This equation gives our optimum result in the case where
the radius within which the velocity dispersion is measured
is treated as a free parameter. If instead we ﬁx the dispersion
measurement to consider stars within exactly Re, the result-
ing scatter is the same as that obtained using the formally
optimal parameter set (see Table 3).

APPENDIX A: WOLF ET AL. ESTIMATOR IN
3D

In the main body of this paper, we have made use of the
estimator of Wolf et al. (2010) expressed in terms of ob-
servable quantities: i.e. the projected stellar half-light (half-

mass) radius, Re, and line-of-sight velocity dispersion, (cid:104)σlos(cid:105)

(equation 9). However, a more fundamental version of the
estimator is given in equation (8), from which Wolf et al.
(2010) derive equation (9) by simply assuming that the 3D
half-light radius, rhalf, is 4Re/3, which is a reasonable approx-
imation for a range of spherically symmetric density proﬁles.
Yet the appropriateness of this assumption could vary signif-
icantly for some galaxies, depending on the shapes of their
stellar density proﬁles. We now investigate the change in the
accuracy of the estimator of Wolf et al. (2010), with respect
to the standard case given in equation (9), when: (i) a value
for rhalf is inferred from the projected stellar density distri-
bution, instead of assuming rhalf = 4Re/3, and (ii) typically
unobservable 3D information on the galaxy size and velocity
dispersion is used in the mass estimation.

A1 Deprojection of the stellar mass proﬁle

In order to assess whether the assumption, rhalf = 4Re/3, is
optimal for the dispersion-dominated galaxies in our simu-
lated sample, which have a broad range of 3D shapes, we
carry out an Abel inversion of the projected mass distribu-
tion for all 1536 projections of each galaxy. We make use
of splines to model the cumulative projected stellar mass
proﬁle, Mstar(< R). This choice allows the model proﬁle to
be quite general in form, in the sense that the inference of
rhalf should not suﬀer from any overly restrictive parame-
terization that may bias the results. In detail, we ﬁnd the

quartic13 spline that interpolates exactly through points of
even spacing, ∆R, on the Mstar(< R) proﬁle, starting from
the galactic centre. The proﬁle is reﬂected about the centre
before ﬁtting, so that the model is well behaved in the inner-
most regions. Additionally, we extend Mstar(< R) for several
∆R beyond the furthest star particle (where it equals the
total stellar mass, Mstar). Starting with an initial spacing of
∆R = Re/2, we recursively multiply ∆R by 0.95 and reﬁt the
spline until the following condition is satisﬁed,

where the sum is over all star particles in the galaxy, with
projected radii Ri. Mmodel(< R) is the stellar mass enclosed
within R according to the spline ﬁt, and nstar is the number
of star particles. The choice of the parameter σﬁt = 0.01Mstar
represents a compromise between the smoothness and accu-
racy of the ﬁt.

Given a model for Mstar(< R), and assuming spherical
symmetry, the 3D stellar density proﬁle, ρ(r), follows from
the Abel integral given in equation (5), where,

The equations can then be solved numerically for rhalf.

In Fig. A1, we show the distribution of the ratio of the
estimated 3D half-mass radius from our deprojection proce-
dure, rdeproj, to the true radius, rhalf, for all galaxies in our
dispersion-dominated sample, alongside the corresponding
distribution from assuming that rhalf is simply 4Re/3. The
distributions are remarkably similar, and show that overall
there is no improvement in the approximation of the 3D size
when switching from using the factor of four thirds to using
our deprojection procedure (the scatter actually increases
slightly for rdeproj).

In Fig. A2(a) we show the distribution of the estimated
to true mass ratio α for all dispersion-dominated galaxies in
our simulated sample, obtained using the standard projected
version of the Wolf et al. (2010) estimator from equation (9)
(as in the upper panel of Fig. 9). Fig. A2(b) shows the dis-
tribution if instead we use the 3D version of the estimator
from equation (8), replacing rhalf → rdeproj. There is no sig-
niﬁcant diﬀerence between the distributions shown in panels
(a) and (b), and so we conclude that assuming rhalf = 4Re/3
is already optimal, despite the scatter shown in Fig. A1.

A2 Using true 3D galaxy properties

It is interesting to ask how the accuracy of the estimator
of Wolf et al. (2010) changes if intrinsic 3D, i.e. typically
observationally inaccessible, information is available on the
galaxy sizes and kinematics. Fig. A2(c) shows the distribu-
tion of the estimated to true mass ratio when using the true
3D half-mass radius in equation (8), so the only projected

quantity used to compute the distribution shown is (cid:104)σlos(cid:105).

The removal of the noise due to the variation of the projected
size reduces the scatter in the distributions, comparing to
panels (a) and (b).

In Fig. A2(d) we show the distribution of the ratio of

the estimated mass from equation (9), i.e. the version of esti-
mator that uses Re, to the true mass within rhalf. Thus, here
α is not the ratio of the estimated mass to the true mass
within the same sphere, as everywhere else in this paper.
The scatter in this distribution is lower than in panel (c),
where the only diﬀerence in the deﬁnition of α is the replace-
ment 3rhalf → 4Re from (c) to (d). That is, equation (9) is a
better estimator of the mass within the true 3D half-mass
radius than equation (8). This result may seem counterintu-
itive at ﬁrst, as the former makes use of only projected in-
formation to estimate the mass, while the true 3D half-mass
radius is used in the latter case. This eﬀect can be under-

stood in terms of the coupled variation of Re and (cid:104)σlos(cid:105) over

lines of sight which view the galaxy from many orientations,
such that the variation in the projected size counteracts that

in the (squared) dispersion, so that the product 4(cid:104)σlos(cid:105)2Re
has a smaller scatter than 3(cid:104)σlos(cid:105)2rhalf for the vast major-
ity of galaxies (see also Laporte et al. 2013a). The result
that equation (9) is a better estimator of M(< rhalf) than
equation (8) is only attractive if for some reason one wanted
to know M(< rhalf) without any associated estimate of rhalf
itself! When full 3D information is available on the stel-
lar velocities, so that we can replace (cid:104)σlos(cid:105) in equation (8)
with the mean one dimensional dispersion, σ1D = σ3D/√3,

the scatter in the estimated masses reduces signiﬁcantly, as
shown in Fig. A2(e). Note that no projected information is
used in this panel, so each galaxy contributes a single value
to the distribution.

Figure 14. Calibration of mass estimator parameters (λ , µ, ν)
using all dispersion-dominated galaxies in our simulated sample
(see equation 17). The upper panel shows the standard deviation
of the estimated to true mass ratio α as a function of λ and ν,
where the proportionality constant µ is chosen such that the es-
timator is unbiased (mean α equals one) for each combination of
λ and ν. The scatter shown is linearly interpolated between ν = 4
and the case where the dispersion is averaged over the whole

galaxy (ν → ∞). The lines show contours of constant standard de-

viation, as labelled. The diamond symbol indicates the location
of minimum scatter (see Table 3). The middle panel shows the
scatter as a function of λ , for the choice of ν which minimizes
the scatter at each value of λ (solid line), and using instead the
velocity dispersion averaged over the whole galaxy (dashed line).
The points show the corresponding results from applying the es-
timators of Walker et al. (2009), Wolf et al. (2010), and Amorisco
& Evans (2011), which each use the dispersion averaged over the
whole galaxy. Note that the α distribution for a given estimator
can have a lower scatter than the dashed line, provided that it is
biased in the mean. The lower panel shows the mean α for each
of these three estimators.

Figure 15. Distribution, f (α), of the estimated to true mass ra-
tio, α, for the unbiased estimator with minimum scatter of the
form given in equation (17). The optimum parameters are given
in Table 3 (as in the horizontal axis label). The distribution con-
siders all dispersion-dominated galaxies (κrot < 0.5), using projec-
tions from 1536 evenly distributed lines of sight. The dashed line
shows the median, and the dotted lines show the 10th and 90th
percentiles. The standard deviation, σ , is also shown. The shaded
regions around the vertical lines and the quoted errors on σ are
the 16th − 84th percentile conﬁdence limits, derived from applying
the estimator to 104 bootstrap samples of the galaxies. Note that
the similar σ errors given in Table 3 for this estimator are instead
derived from the distribution of optimum σ values obtained from
repeatedly calibrating equation (17) on bootstrap samples of the
same galaxies. Each projection of each galaxy contributes to the
distribution with equal weight, and the distribution is normalised
to have unit area.

Figure A1. Distributions, f (rapprox/rhalf), of the ratio of approx-
imations, rapprox, for the 3D half-mass radius, rhalf, to the true
value of the radius for galaxies in our dispersion-dominated sam-
ple (κrot < 0.5). The rapprox values are computed for 1536 evenly dis-
tributed lines of sight, assuming either that rhalf = 4Re/3, or using
rdeproj from our Abel deprojection procedure (diﬀerent colours).
Each projection of each galaxy contributes to the distributions
with equal weight, and each distribution is normalised to have
unit area. The vertical dashed lines show the median ratios, and
the dotted lines show the 10th and 90th percentiles. The standard
deviation, σ , of each distribution is given in the same colour as
the lines. The shaded regions around the vertical lines and the

σ errors are the 16th − 84th percentile conﬁdence limits, derived
from 104 bootstrap samples of the galaxies for each distribution.

Figure A2. Distributions, f (α), of the estimated to true mass ratio, α, for all dispersion-dominated galaxies (κrot < 0.5), obtained from
projecting over 1536 evenly distributed lines of sight, using diﬀerent versions of the estimator proposed by Wolf et al. (2010). The
deﬁnition of α is diﬀerent in each panel, and is given explicitly in each horizontal axis label. The deﬁnitions are: (a) the ratio of the
estimated mass using equation (9) to the mass enclosed within the assumed 3D half-mass radius (4Re/3) – this is the standard deﬁnition
of αWolf as given in equation (14), (b) the estimated to true mass ratio from equation (8) using the deprojected 3D half-mass radius,
rdeproj, from our Abel integration procedure in place of rhalf, (c) the same as (b) but using the true 3D half-mass radius, rhalf, (d) the
ratio of the estimated mass from equation (9) to the mass within rhalf (i.e. this is the ratio of the estimated to true mass within diﬀerent
spheres, unless rhalf = 4Re/3), and (e) the estimated to true mass ratio if we replace (cid:104)σlos(cid:105) in equation (8) with the mean one dimensional
stellar velocity dispersion, σ1D = σ3D/√3 (so no projected information is used in this panel). Each projection (if applicable) of each galaxy
contributes to the distributions with equal weight, and each distribution is normalised to have unit area. The vertical dashed lines show
the median α values, and the dotted lines show the 10th and 90th percentiles. The standard deviation, σ , of each distribution is given in
each panel. The shaded regions around the vertical lines and the σ errors are the 16th − 84th percentile conﬁdence limits, derived from
104 bootstrap samples of the galaxies for each distribution.
