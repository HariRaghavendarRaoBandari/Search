The X-shaped Bulge of the Milky Way revealed by WISE

Melissa Ness1,2 & Dustin Lang3,4

ABSTRACT

The Milky Way bulge has a boxy/peanut morphology and an X-shaped struc-
ture. This X-shape has been revealed by the ‘split in the red clump’ from star
counts along the line of sight toward the bulge, measured from photometric sur-
veys. This boxy, X-shaped bulge morphology is not unique to the Milky Way
and such bulges are observed in other barred spiral galaxies. N-body simulations
show that boxy and X-shaped bulges are formed from the disk via dynamical in-
stabilities. It has also been proposed that the Milky Way bulge is not X-shaped,
but rather, the apparent split in the red clump stars is a consequence of diﬀer-
ent stellar populations, in an old classical spheroidal bulge. We present a WISE
image of the Milky Way bulge, produced by downsampling the publicly available
“unWISE” coadds. The WISE image of the Milky Way bulge shows that the
X-shaped nature of the Milky Way bulge is self-evident and irrefutable. The
X-shape morphology of the bulge in itself and the fraction of bulge stars that
comprise orbits within this structure has important implications for the forma-
tion history of the Milky Way, and, given the ubiquity of boxy X-shaped bulges,
spiral galaxies in general.

Introduction

The boxy nature of the bulge of the Milky Way was ﬁrst revealed in the COBE satellite
image (Dwek et al. 1995). Using photometric data from the VVV survey, Wegg & Gerhard

(2013) measured the three dimensional density of red clump stars in the bulge, earlier revealed
to show two peaks along the line of sight (McWilliam & Zoccali 2010; Nataf et al. 2010), and
determined their distribution to be characteristic of a strong boxy/peanut bulge within a
barred galaxy. This observed split in the red clump is reported to be a property of the more
metal rich stars in the bulge, with [Fe/H] > –0.5 (Ness et al. 2012; Uttenthaler et al. 2012);
although according to Nataf et al. (2014) this metallicity dependence may be subject to
biases. Portail et al. (2015b) used the VVV red clump stellar density to show that the Milky
Way’s bulge has an oﬀ-centered X-structure and using orbit based characterization of the
X-shape, determined that the fraction of stars in orbits that contribute to the X-shape is 40–
45% of the mass of the bulge (Portail et al. 2015a). The X-shape in the Milky Way bulge is
similar to that seen in the unsharp masked images of other barred spiral galaxies (e.g. Bureau
et al. 2006). Such X-shaped structures, which underly the boxy/peanut, have been shown to
form in N-body simulations, via dynamical instabilities in the disk (e.g. Athanassoula 2005;
Debattista et al. 2006; Martinez-Valpuesta et al. 2006). This shape is a consequence of the
x1v1 (Pfenniger 1984; Athanassoula 1992) and other orbit families (e.g. Portail et al. 2015a).

Lee et al. (2015) have questioned the existence of the X-shaped nature of the bulge,
instead proposing the split in the red clump stars to be a consequence of diﬀerent stellar
populations in a classical bulge. Conversely, Gonzalez et al. (2015) summarise the set of
observational properties of the bulge which explain the link between the double or split red
clump and the X-shape.

We present, for the ﬁrst time, the WISE image of the Milky Way (Lang 2014) which
clearly demonstrates the Milky Way bulge is irrefutably morphologically, X-shaped. This
follows expectations from the observational evidence, from dynamical models of boxy/peanut
bulges like the Milky Way, and from observations of other barred galaxies that reveal such
an X-shaped proﬁle is not uncommon (Laurikainen et al. 2014).

2. The unWISE image of the Milky Way bulge

The Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE; Wright et al. 2010) is a full sky pho-
tometric survey using four bands in the mid-infrared at 3.4 µm, 4.6 µm, 12 µm and 22 µm
(W1–W4). The original WISE data release was based on a co-adding approach that is opti-
mal for detecting isolated point sources but which eﬀectively blurs the images. Lang (2014)
implemented an alternative co-adding methodology that does not degrade the resolution of
the imaging. These “unWISE” coadds have been publicly released.1

Figure 1 presents the bulge region of the Milky Way, resampled to galactic coordinates
from the unWISE images, across (|(cid:96)|,|b|) < (60, 30) in WISE bands W1 and W2. This
presents the overall Milky Way structures in exquisite detail. No additional unsharp masking
or equivalent techniques have been used to enhance these data. The bulge in the central
region of this Figure shows a clear X-shaped morphology. Note that the arms of the X-shape
are asymmetrical around the minor axis and appear larger at left than at right. This is a
real projection eﬀect and reﬂects that the bulge is oriented at about 27◦ degrees with respect
to the line of sight (Wegg & Gerhard 2013), with the nearest side at positive longitudes.
The X-shape is also visible, though with more artifacts, in the oﬃcial AllWISE data release
imaging.2 The W3 and W4 bands largely trace dust rather than stellar light and therefore
do not reveal the X-shaped proﬁle.

3. The contrast enhanced unWISE image of the bulge

Figure 2 presents a contrast enhanced and zoomed in version of Figure 1. This better
reveals the X-shape light proﬁle of the bulge and its extent across ((cid:96), b) in the WISE image.
This Figure was produced with a median subtraction across each row to suppress the contri-

bution from the disk. The arms in the image extend to longitudes of |(cid:96)| ≈ 10◦ and latitudes
of |b| (cid:46) 10◦; (although note again the arms on the near side are larger than those of the far
side due to projection). This extent on the sky corresponds to a length of about 2.4 kpc for
each arm, for a distance of the bulge of 8.3 kpc from the Sun and a bar angle of 27◦.

Fig. 2.— The same as Figure 1, but zoomed in and with the median of each row of the
image subtracted to provide a better contrast which reveals the X-shape morphology in
better detail.

4. The residuals of the unWISE image of the bulge

Finally, we ﬁt and subtract a simple exponential disk model to make the bulge structure
more clear. We zoom in to the central region of the galaxy, compute the W1 − W2 color
of each pixel, and mask the top and bottom 5% in order to suppress the inﬂuence of the
most dusty regions on the ﬁt. We then ﬁt a simple exponential disk model, where the ellipse
shape parameteres are shared between the W1 and W2 bands, and each pixel is given equal
weight. The model ﬁt parameters we get are a half-light radius on the major axis of about

1.9 kpc and an axis ratio of 0.38, yielding a vertical half-light radius of about 720 pc. Figure
3 shows these results. The projection eﬀect is again clear in these residual maps, which
reﬂects that the bulge is orientated at 27◦ with respect to the line of sight, with the nearest
side at positive longitudes.

X structure more apparent. Top-left: Data. Top-middle: Data, masking out the top and
bottom 5% of pixels based on W1 − W2 color, as well as pixels with negative ﬂux. The
diagonal structure at the top of the image is due to scattered light from the Moon in the
unWISE coadds. Top-right: Exponential disk model ﬁt. Bottom-left: Residuals (data minus

model). Bottom-middle: Masked residuals. Bottom-right: 50-pixel (∼ 1.7◦) median ﬁlter of

5. Conclusion

Using the publicly available “unWISE” coadds, we have presented new images of the
bulge of the Milky Way in the W1 and W2 bands. These directly reveal its X-shaped nature
in the integrated light, even without any special image processing or enhancement. Our

contrast enhancement and residual maps further highlight the extent of the X-shape that
underlies the boxy structure. Critical to understanding the bulge is a further and detailed
characterisation of the stars that are in the arms of the X-shape, the spatial extent of which
is clearly demonstrated in our Figures. The spatial mapping we have presented in galactic
coordinates will therefore provide a useful guide for current and future spectroscopic surveys
such as APOGEE (Majewski et al. 2015), 4-MOST (de Jong et al. 2014) and bulge programs
associated with the GALAH survey (De Silva et al. 2015). These data can be used to guide
stellar target selection, where examining the spectroscopic ages (e.g. Martig et al. 2016; Ness
et al. 2015) and metallicities of stars in the arms of the X-shape as a function of ((cid:96), b) will be
necessary to understand the formation of the bulge and constrain the formation processes
relevant in the Milky Way.
