Abstract. We quantify the thermodynamic requirement for the Vertical Shear Instability and
evaluate its relevance to realistic protoplanetary disks as a potential route to hydrodynamic
turbulence.

Keywords. accretion, accretion disks, hydrodynamics, instabilities, methods: analytical

1. Introduction

A purely hydrodynamic route to turbulence has important implications for the evo-
lution of cold protoplanetary disks and solids within them. One such candidate is the
Vertical Shear Instability (VSI) operating in disks where the orbital frequency Ω depends
on the height z away from the disk midplane. While astrophysical disks generally possess
vertical shear, VSI also requires short thermal timescales. We determine a quantitative
thermodynamic requirement for the VSI, and apply our results to realistic disk condi-
tions. We ﬁnd the VSI can operate eﬀectively at 5—50AU in a typical protoplanetary
disk, with characteristic growth times of 30 orbits.

2. The need for rapid cooling for the VSI

Astrophysical disks generally have vertical shear, ∂zΩ 6= 0. This is a source of free
energy, and may thus lead to instability (Goldreich & Schubert 1967; Urpin 2003; Barker
& Latter 2015), provided the disturbance vertical lengthscale is much larger than its
radial lengthscale. However, if the disk is stably stratiﬁed, as is typical for irradiated
protoplanetary disks, the VSI also requires rapid cooling to overcome the stabilizing
inﬂuence of vertical buoyancy (Nelson et al. 2013).

More speciﬁcally, for a vertically isothermal disk with radial temperature dependence
T ∝ rq, the cooling or thermal relaxation timescale tc must be suﬃciently small for the
VSI to operate eﬀectively:

tcΩK <

h|q|
γ − 1

≡ βcrit,

(2.1)

where ΩK is the Keplerian frequency, h is the disk aspect ratio, and γ is the adiabatic
index (Lin & Youdin 2015). Since protoplanetary disks are typically thin, h ≪ 1, Eq. 2.1
implies that tc ≪ ΩK is required for the VSI. That is, the thermal timescale must be
signiﬁcantly shorter than the dynamical timescale, which reﬂects the fact that vertical
shear is weakly destabilizing, while vertical buoyancy is strongly stabilizing.

3. Applicability of the VSI in realistic protoplanetary disks

We solve the linear stability problem for axisymmetric disturbances in a model of the
Solar Nebula described in Chiang & Youdin (2010). We include in the energy equation

a realistic cooling function, based on dust opacity, which depends on z as well as the
disturbance lengthscale.

In Fig. 1 we plot characteristic VSI growth times for a range of radial perturbation
wavenumbers. Growth times increase rapidly at . 5AU and & 100AU as the cooling
times violate Eq. 2.1 in these regions. Thus, the VSI is most eﬀective at intermediate
radii. Notice also the growth times are strongly dependent on lengthscale toward the
optically-thick inner disk, with smaller-scale disturbances being able to operate further
inwards. In the optically-thin outer disk, cooling times are independent of scale and all
scales are stabilized beyond approximate the same radius.

4. Conclusions

Vertical shear is ubiquitous in astrophysical disks. Such conﬁgurations are unstable if
the cooling timescales are signiﬁcantly shorter than the dynamical timescale (Eq. 2.1).
This can be satisﬁed for small-scale disturbances at few 10s of AU in typical protoplan-
etary disk models with realistic cooling. The VSI is thus dynamically important in the
outer disk, with potentially signiﬁcantly implications for transport and dust evolution.
