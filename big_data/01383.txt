Abstract

A calculation of the Sommerfeld enhancement is presented and applied to the problem of
s-wave non-relativistic dark matter annihilation. The diﬀerence from previous computations
in the literature is that the eﬀect of the underlying short-range scattering process is consis-
tently included together with the long-range force in the eﬀective QM Schr¨odinger problem.
Our procedure satisﬁes partial-wave unitarity where previous calculations fail. We provide
analytic results for some potentials of phenomenological relevance.

1 Introduction

The annihilation cross section of thermal relic weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark
matter controls both the relic abundance through freeze-out in the early Universe as well as the
prospects for indirect detection.
It is important to establish to what extent the annihilation
cross section at freeze-out, when WIMPs are mildly non-relativistic with thermal velocities of
order v ∼ 0.2, is related to the annihilation cross section in systems where the WIMP is highly
non-relativistic, including the Galaxy (v ∼ 5 × 10−4) or the epoch of recombination (v ∼ 10−10
for a WIMP with ∼ TeV mass and kinetic decoupling temperature of a few MeV).

A well-known eﬀect that can modify the annihilation cross section in the deep non-relativistic
regime is the Sommerfeld eﬀect (SE), arising when the WIMP couples to a light force media-
tor [1–4]. The SE was estimated in the literature using a factorized formula (see, e.g. Ref. [5,6]),

σv = σv0 × S(v).

(1)

Eq. (1) is computed in two steps:

1. σv0 is the velocity-weighted hard annihilation cross section, computed using the short-range

physics alone, ignoring the long-range potential

1

2. The SE factor S(v) ≡ |ψ0(0)|2 is derived from ψ0(x), the wave function for the non-
relativistic two-body dark matter system, determined as a solution to the quantum me-
chanics (QM) scattering problem using a Schr¨odinger equation in which the short-range
physics is omitted, with asymptotic behaviour ψ0(r → ∞) → eikz + f eikr
r .
Eq. (1) was used in many examples in the literature, but in certain situations it breaks
down. A noted example is the occurrence of a bound state with zero binding energy in the
long-range Schr¨odinger equation. (See, e.g., §133 in Ref. [7].) If a bound state solution exists
with binding energy |Eb| much smaller than the typical potential energy V0, then the SE factor
approaches the form1 S(v) ∼
µv2/2+|Eb| . Since σv0 approaches a constant for s-wave hard-
annihilation process (the Bethe 1/v law), Eq. (1) gives velocity-weighted cross section σv ∝ 1/v2
at small v for |Eb| → 0. This violates parametrically the partial-wave unitarity limit [7, 10],
σ ≤ π/p2 = π/(µv)2. A more obvious example in which Eq. (1) fails, is when σv0 is itself not
very small, such that a ﬁnite S(v) can lead to σv violating the unitarity bound at ﬁnite velocity
without any special resonance of parametric origin.

V0

In the current paper we identify the source of trouble in Eq. (1) and ﬁx it in a simple way.
The basic result is easy to explain: probability conservation requires that the naive SE factor
S(v) = |ψ0(0)|2, given by the modulus of the wave function at the origin neglecting the short-
range potential, should be replaced by |ψ(0)|2, the modulus of the full wave function including
the short-range interaction. Our main task in the paper will be to compute ψ(0) and to show
how using it instead of ψ0(0) in Eq. (1) restores unitarity.

Our formula for the full annihilation cross section, given in Eq. (38), is only slightly more
complicated than Eq. (1). To compute the full SE we require one more quantity [denoted
T (v) in Eq. (38)] based on the long-range interaction, in addition to the usual S(v); and one
more quantity [the short-range elastic scattering cross section, denoted σsc,0 in Eq. (38)] based
on the short-range interaction,
in addition to the hard annihilation cross section σv0. We
provide analytic expressions of the new T (v) term for speciﬁc long-range potentials of interest
in typical applications, including the Coulomb and well potentials and the Hulth´en potential
(approximating the Yukawa potential), for which the usual S(v) term was derived elsewhere in
the literature.

In Sec. 2 we derive our main result and present a general formula for the full SE. In Sec. 2.2
we show that close to a resonant point, for perturbative underlying short-range cross section,
the full SE can be obtained by simple velocity shift S(v) → S(v + vc) in Eq. (1). The shift
velocity vc contains a product of short- and long-range information that we compute explicitly
for the Hulth´en potential.
In Sec. 3 we provide analytic results for speciﬁc potentials. We
focus in particular on the Hulth´en potential, approximating the Yukawa interaction, where we
demonstrate how our SE computation conserves partial-wave unitarity. In Sec. 4 we conclude.

2 Formulation

The non-relativistic eﬀective action for the dark matter two-body system is obtained by inte-
grating out degrees of freedom with large momentum [2–4]. The resulting Schr¨odinger equation

1Ref. [8] discussed this limit using a modiﬁed Breit-Wigner formula introduced by Bethe and Placzek [9]. See

also §145 in Ref. [7].

2µ(cid:21) ψ(x) = 0.

(2)

Here µ = M/2 is the reduced mass. Long-range light mediator exchange gives rise to the
real, rotationally-symmetric potential V (r), r = |x|. The short-range process is encoded in the
term uδ3(x) with complex parameter u. We note that Eq. (2) is adequate for s-wave short-
range scattering, which is what we address here and is enough to establish the formalism.
Generalization to higher-l initial state is left for subsequent work.

Our objective is to solve Eq. (2); the annihilation cross section can then be read from the
µ Imψ∗(x)∇ψ(x).
2µ ∇2 +V (|x|)+uδ(3)(x), and imposing steady state ∂t|ψ(x)|2 = 0,

solution as follows. The probability current associated with ψ(x) is j(x) = 1
Using the Hamiltonian H = − 1
we have

∇ · j(x) = 2Imu|ψ(0)|2δ(3)(x).

(3)

The full velocity-weighted annihilation cross section is given by integrating the divergence of the
probability current,

σv = −Z d3x∇ · j(x) = (−2Imu)|ψ(0)|2.

(4)

The velocity factor v on the LHS refers to the ﬂux of the incident wave, taken as eipz at inﬁnity.
We are already in place to compare with earlier literature.

• Neglecting both the long- and the short-range potentials in Eq. (2) gives a free wave

ψf ree(x) = eikz, leading to the usual identiﬁcation Imu = − σv0
2 .

• Neglecting the short-range potential but keeping the long-range potential in Eq. (2) gives

the solution ψ0(x), leading to Eq. (1) with S(v) = |ψ0(0)|2.

• The full solution ψ(x), where we solve Eq. (2) retaining both the short- and the long-range
potentials, gives the full SE as |ψ(0)|2. The shortcoming of Eq. (1) is that is fails to conserve
probability by using ψ0 instead of ψ.

We solve Eq. (2) following Jackiw [11] that analyzed the scattering amplitude for the QM
delta-function potential. We deﬁne the Green’s function G(x) and the wave function ψ0(x),
chosen to satisfy

Using Eq. (9) in Eq. (4) gives us the full SE directly: SE = S(v)/ |1 + 2µuG(0)|2. The denomina-
tor corrects Eq. (1) and shows in what way factorization needs to be modiﬁed. However, we are
not quite there yet, because G(0) is divergent. This divergence is regulated with a redeﬁnition
of the parameter u absorbing an inﬁnite constant, as we now discuss.

Note that the divergent part of G(0) is independent of momentum p. In addition, the divergence
is restricted to ReG(0), while ImG(0) is ﬁnite for real V (r).

To subtract the divergence we deﬁne a renormalized coupling at reference momentum p0,

kp0

2µu

(18)

The subscript on Gp0 is there to emphasize that this G is to be evaluated at p0.
In QFT
language, (2µu)−1 is a bare coupling and ReGp0(0) is a counter term. Deferring some subtleties
to the next subsection, it is convenient to take large reference momentum p0 and to deﬁne the
short-range cross section σv0 as the cross section measured at p0. We are left with the task of
computing kp0 from this matching procedure; this we do in the next subsection by appealing to
some more basic QM.

Before moving on, note that above we used a regularization scheme in which G(0) is replaced
by G(ǫ), ﬁnally taking ǫ → 0. Jackiw [11] took a diﬀerent approach, examining both momentum
cut-oﬀ and dimensional regularization. But then, Jackiw [11] was interested in the scattering
amplitude for the delta function potential alone, while we are interested in the interplay between
short- and long-range physics. To this end we ﬁnd our procedure convenient.

To isolate the short-range physics we need to consider the limit of large kinetic energy p2/2µ
compared to the typical potential energy. To be precise, we deﬁne V (r) = V−1/(2µr) + ˜V (r),
where ˜V (r) is assumed to be regular everywhere. The large momentum limit we are interested
for all r. In this limit the solution for gp(r) that satisﬁes gp(0) = 1 at
the origin, and that matches to an outgoing wave in the leading WKB approximation at large
r, is found as

Recall that we have deﬁned the renormalized inverse-scattering length parameter kp0 in
Eq. (18) by appealing to the Green’s function at reference momentum p0. We see that if we set
p = p0 and consider large p0 w.r.t. the long-range potential, in the sense discussed above, we
can use Eqs. (29-30) to ﬁx kp0, up to the sign of Rekp0, from the cross section deﬁned at p0.

In perturbative examples life is easier because Imkp0 is larger than µ (and so larger than p0)

In what follows we focus, for simplicity, on the perturbative regime where Eqs. (31-32) are

valid and our results take a particularly simple form.

We still need to compute the long-range eﬀect encoded in g′

S(v) = |dp|2 =

p(0) = |gp(∞)|2 ,

where S(v) is the usual naive SE factor from Eq. (1). To prove this, deﬁne the Wronskian

Together with gp(0) = 1, derived before, this gives Eq. (33).

It is useful at this point to refer again to the usual formula Eq. (1). This should arise as the

limit of our Eq. (25) for |kp0| ≫ |g′

p(0) − g′

p0(0)|. Using Eq. (33) we have, in this limit,

In general, for arbitrary small momentum p, Reg′
p at the origin must be determined by solving
Eq. (12) using the full long-range potential; this situation is similar to that of the usual S(v)
factor. Below we will give analytic solutions for speciﬁc examples: (i) the Hulth´en potential, ap-
proximating the Yukawa potential; (ii) the Coulomb potential arising from a massless mediator;
(iii) the well potential.

This concludes our basic calculation: the SE factor for annihilation, including regularization
by the short-range process, is given as the coeﬃcient of σv0 in Eq. (38). In the next section
we provide analytic computations of the SE for speciﬁc examples. Analytic calculations and
approximations for the S(v) term exist in several references; we add to those a calculation of
the T (v) term. The short-range information: σv0, σsc,0, and the sign η of the short-range force,
should be provided according to the underlying model. For example, a thermal-freezout WIMP
model would have σv0 ≈ 3 × 10−26 cm3/sec, etc.

2.2 Regularising velocity near a zero energy bound state

Particularly strong SE arise when the Schr¨odinger equation including the long-range potential
admits a bound state solution with zero binding energy |Eb| → 0 [2–4, 12]. At small velocity
near |Eb| → 0, the naive SE factor scales as

S(v) ≈

V0

(µ/2)v2 + |Eb|

→

2V0
µv2 ,

(39)

where V0 is the characteristic scale of the potential energy. Ref. [2–4] noted that the singular
1/v2 scaling is cut-oﬀ when the short-range contact term is accounted for perturbatively in
solving the Schr¨odinger equation, and that the SE saturates at some velocity vc. Using Eq. (38)
we can verify these observations directly.

For simplicity and for the sake of comparison with Refs. [2–4] we neglect the real part of
the inverse-scattering length induced by the short-range interaction. This amounts to setting

σsc,0 =(cid:16) µ2σv0

4π (cid:17) σv0 in Eq. (38). Plugging the asymptotic form Eq. (39) into Eq. (38) we ﬁnd

(40)

(41)

σv
σv0

≃ S(v + vc),

vc =

V0 µ σv0

2π

.

Thus we derive and conﬁrm the use of a regularising velocity3. This can be plugged in the usual
formula Eq. (1) using S(v) → S (v + vc).

The velocity scale vc is useful for ﬁnding the SE saturation point. To assess this scale
for phenomenological applications we examine it for the Yukawa potential VY (r) = −αe−mr/r
arising from a light mediator with mass m ≪ M , where M = 2µ, again, is the WIMP mass. In
this example V0 ≈ αm, giving

(Yukawa potential).

We scaled the high-velocity annihilation cross section to the relevant value for thermal freeze-out
dark matter.

For parameters in the ballpark chosen in Eq. (42) with α = O(1), the numerical value of vc
makes it phenomenologically relevant for indirect searches for annihilating dark matter, implying
that the SE would be saturated in Galactic systems. For comparison, the typical virial velocity
in the Milky Way halo is about a factor of 3 smaller than this vc, while in dwarf galaxies the
WIMP velocity would be much smaller. Models where these parametrics apply include, for
example, the dilaton portal of [13].

3Note that the T (v) term is neglected in Eqs. (40-41); we could keep it by adding to vc a velocity-dependent
imaginary part and letting S(v) → S(|v + vc|). However, (i) very close to resonance the T (v) term can be omitted,
and (ii) studying the Hulth´en potential, we ﬁnd that Eqs. (40-41) generally provide a good approximation to the
full result for perturbative σv0.

8

For the electroweak supersymmetric WIMPs of, e.g., Refs. [2–4], we should use α ∼ 10−2,
M = O(1 TeV), and m/M ∼ 0.1. This gives vc ∼ 10−7, well below the relevant velocity scale in
low redshift astrophysical systems of interest for indirect detection.

In the early universe, before the dark matter forms virialised halos, the WIMP velocity may
be much lower than in a typical Galaxy and the regularization may be important even for TeV-
scale or lighter WIMPs with perturbative interactions. However, away from resonances, the
saturation velocity of the usual S(v) factor (v ∼ m/αM ) tends to greatly exceed the regular-
ization velocity vc, for α ≪ 1. Accordingly, for perturbative interactions, pronounced eﬀects of
the regularization in the early universe will be conﬁned to the small regions of parameter space
near resonance peaks.

It has been previously noted that in such resonant regions, annihilation may recouple during
the radiation-dominated epoch after the dark matter kinetically decouples from the Standard
Model, since the ∼ 1/v2 scaling of S(v) leads to an increasing annihilation rate per comoving
volume [14]. This eﬀect can lead to a second phase of exponential depletion of the dark matter
density, meaning that the correct relic density can be obtained with a much smaller short-range
annihilation cross section.
In this case, it can be very important to take the regularization
into account; examples that we have calculated indicate that the short-range annihilation cross
section required to yield the correct relic density in such a resonant scenario can increase by
several orders of magnitude, relative to the case with no regularization, albeit in all cases it
remains well below the “standard” thermal relic value of hσvi ≈ 3 × 10−26 cm3/s.

3.1 Hulth´en potential

The Hulth´en potential is

V (r) = −

αm∗e−m∗r
1 − e−m∗r .

(43)

We consider this potential because, choosing m∗ = (π2/6)m, it provides a good approximation
of the commonly encountered Yukawa potential VY (r) = −αe−mr/r with consistent asymptotic
behaviour at large and small r.

The SE with Eq. (43) admits an analytic solution (see Refs. [15, 16] for a computation
of the S(v) term). Here we add the ingredients needed for the full formula Eq.(38). Deﬁne

In Fig. 1 we show the SE for the Hulth´en potential. On the left we show the naive SE given
by S(v) of Eq. (48), corresponding to the usual computation in the literature. The regulated SE
computed from Eq.(38) is superimposed, but the diﬀerence from the usual method is invisible
on the scale of the plot. On the right we zoom-in on one of the resonant peaks. The regulated
SE of Eq.(38) is the smooth lower curve. For this plot, we took α = 1, v = 10−6, and short-
range cross sections σv0 = 1/(32πM 2) and Rekp0 = 0 corresponding to short-range elastic cross
section σsc,0 = (µ2σv0/4π)σv0.

In Fig. 2 we study the interplay with partial-wave unitarity by inspecting the SE near a
resonance peak. The partial-wave unitarity limit for s-wave annihilation, σv < π/(µ2v) corre-
sponding to SEmax = π/(µ2σv0v), is shown by the dashed line. The naive S(v) goes above
the limit at small velocities. The regulated SE saturates the limit and stays below it. For this
plot, we took m∗ = 0.0625M , α = 1, and short-range annihilation and elastic cross sections
σv0 = 1/(32πM 2) and σsc,0 = (µ2σv0/4π)σv0.

In Fig. 3 we show SE vs v for the Hulth´en potential, with a large short-range annihilation

3.2 Coulomb potential

The SE for the attractive Coulomb potential, V (r) = −α/r, can be obtained from the result of
Sec. 3.1 by taking the mass parameter m∗ → 0. This leads to

the factor dp; the normalization of dp is given of course by |dp|2 = S(v), but obtaining the
phase requires a modiﬁcation to the plane wave asymptotic states that we have assumed in
Eq. (14). This is the standard logarithmic asymptotic phase modiﬁcation due to the slow-falling
1/r potential, discussed in textbooks (see e.g. §7.13 in Ref. [17]). Note that dp is not needed in
the full SE formula for annihilation, Eq. (38), for which one only requires S(v) and T (v).

4 Conclusion

Several references in the literature noted that the naive factorized estimate of the Sommerfeld
eﬀect (SE), given by σv ≈ σv0 × S(v) [see Eq. (1) and discussion around it], fails in speciﬁc
parametric points where the Schr¨odinger equation for the long-range force develops a bound
state with zero binding energy. At these isolated points, the naive calculation violates partial-
wave unitarity. We add to this the observation that a large but ﬁnite S(v) factor can boost
σv, naively estimated as above, such that it violates the unitarity limit even if the short-range
process itself is perturbative, σv0 ≪ π/µ2v0.

Also in the literature, referring speciﬁcally to the zero energy bound state problem, it was
commented that the apparent unitarity violation should be regularised by the ﬁnite width of the
zero energy quasi-bound state. In the analyses of Hisano et al [2–4] a full Schr¨odinger equation
is derived from the quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT), containing explicitly the non-hermitian contact
term representing short-range annihilation; it is then argued there that the apparent unitarity
violation is an artefact of treating the contact term perturbatively in the solution.

We identify the problem from another angle, taking the eﬀective quantum mechanics (QM)
perspective where it is clear that the usual formulation of the SE does not conserve probability,
because it does not account for the probability ﬂux absorbed at the origin r → 0 by the short-
range annihilation process.

We solve the problem by referring to Jackiw’s [11] calculation of the scattering amplitude
for a delta function potential. In this respect, our contribution is in that we fulﬁl the suggestion
of Hisano et al [2–4] to solve completely the contact term eﬀects. The ﬁnal expression for the
full SE factor for annihilation is given in Eq. (38).

Calculating the full SE with our formalism is as straightforward as it is in the usual naive
formula. A technical diﬀerence is that the full result requires one more quantity encoding the
long-range force [contained in the new term T (v), a natural counterpart to the usual S(v) term];
and one more quantity encoding short-range physics (the short-range elastic scattering cross
section σsc,0).
In Sec. 3 we gave analytic expressions of the new T (v) term for the Hulth´en
potential (a close approximation to the Yukawa potential) as well as for the Coulomb and well
potentials. We also recap the formulae for S(v), found in existing literature for these potentials.
For perturbative underlying short-range cross section σv0 ≪ π/µ2v0, under the eﬀect of
long-range Yukawa, Hulth´en, or well potentials, a particularly simple prescription is given in
Sec. 2.2: the full SE is obtained by the velocity shift S(v) → S(v + vc) with vc given in Eq. (41).
While we have clariﬁed and solved the basic problem with the SE at large ampliﬁcation,
several issues were left out in the current paper and merit further work. These include (i) gen-
eralization to the multi-state problem, relevant for e.g. the electroweak super-partner scenario
of [2–4]; (ii) generalization to p-wave and higher-l initial states; (iii) complete characterization
of the SE for elastic scattering.
