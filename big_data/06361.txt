A SEPARABLE FRÉCHET SPACE OF ALMOST

UNIVERSAL DISPOSITION

C. BARGETZ, J. KĄKOL, AND W. KUBIŚ

Abstract. The Gurari˘ı space is the unique separable Banach
space G which is of almost universal disposition for ﬁnite-dimensional
Banach spaces, which means that for every ε > 0, for all ﬁnite-
dimensional normed spaces E ⊆ F , for every isometric embedding
e : E → G there exists an ε-isometric embedding f : F → G such
that f ↾ E = e. We show that GN with a special sequence of
semi-norms is of almost universal disposition for ﬁnite-dimensional
graded Fréchet spaces. The construction relies heavily on the uni-
versal operator on the Gurari˘ı space, recently constructed by Gar-
bulińska-Węgrzyn and the third author. This yields in particular
that GN is universal in the class of all separable Fréchet spaces.

1. Introduction

A remarkable result of Banach and Mazur [13] states that the sep-
arable Banach space C[0, 1] is universal for separable Banach spaces.
The above theorem has been extended by Mazur and Orlicz to the

class of separable Fréchet spaces, i.e. metrizable and complete locally
convex spaces: They proved that the separable Fréchet space C(R) is
universal in the class of all separable Fréchet spaces, see again [13]. An
essential progress of the research around the Banach-Mazur theorem is
due to Gurari˘ı. The Gurari˘ı space constructed by Gurari˘ı [8] in 1965,
is the separable Banach space G of “almost universal disposition for
ﬁnite-dimensional spaces” that is:

(G) For every ε > 0, for every ﬁnite-dimensional normed spaces
E ⊆ F , for every isometric embedding e : E → G there exists
an ε-isometric embedding f : F → G such that f ↾ E = e.

Moreover, if Y is any other separable Banach space ﬁtting this deﬁni-
tion, then there exists a linear isomorphism u : G → Y with kuk · ku−1k
arbitrarily close to 1. Lusky [11] proved that all separable Banach
spaces of almost universal disposition are isometric, see also [10] for
a simpler proof. Recall, that a linear operator f : E → F between
Banach spaces E and F is an ε-isometric embedding for ε > 0 if

(1 + ε)−1 · kxk ≤ kf (x)k ≤ (1 + ε) · kxk, x ∈ E \ {0}

Recall also that Gurari˘ı has already observed in [8] that no separable
Banach space E is of universal disposition, i.e. satisﬁes condition (G)
with removing ε.

Being motivated by recent developments in the theory of Fréchet
spaces we will study the concrete separable Fréchet space GN endowed
with the product topology and generated by two natural sequences of
semi-norms, where G is the Gurari˘ı space. We prove that GN is univer-
sal in the class of all separable Fréchet spaces although (as we show)
that there is no separable Fréchet space which is of universal disposition
for ﬁnite-dimensional Fréchet spaces. Our main result states however
that GN is the unique separable Fréchet space which is of almost uni-
versal disposition for ﬁnite-dimensional Fréchet spaces.

2. Preliminaries

Recall that a Fréchet space is a metrizable locally convex linear topo-
logical space which is complete with respect to its canonical uniformity.
It is well-known that a complete separated locally convex topological
vector space is a Fréchet space if and only if it satisﬁes the following
condition: There exists a sequence {k · kn}n∈N of semi-norms in X such
that Bi(v, r) = {x ∈ X : maxn≤i kx − vkn < r}, where i ∈ N, v ∈ X,
r > 0, generate the topology of X. Fréchet spaces have played an im-
portant role in functional analysis for a very long time. Many vector

A SEPARABLE FRÉCHET SPACE OF ALMOST UNIVERSAL DISPOSITION 3

spaces of holomorphic, diﬀerentiable or continuous functions which ap-
pear in analysis and its applications carry a natural Fréchet topology.
We refer the reader to an excellent survey of some recent developments
in the theory of Fréchet spaces and of their duals, see [2]. We refer also
to [13] for other fundamental facts and concepts related with Fréchet
spaces.

In this paper Fréchet spaces E are considered with a ﬁxed sequence
of semi-norms. In the case of an increasing sequence, i.e.
if k · k1 ≤
k · k2 ≤ . . ., we call (following Vogt [14]) E endowed with this sequence
a graded Fréchet space.

Graded Fréchet spaces have been studied in the context of the inverse
function theorem of Nash and Moser, see [9], and in the context of tame
Fréchet spaces, see e.g. [14, 15, 12]. Note however that the concept of
the category of graded Fréchet spaces considered in [5] diﬀers from
the notion of graded Fréchet spaces used in this article. For a recent
application of graded Fréchet spaces, we refer the intersted reader to [4].
In this section we construct an increasing sequence of semi-norm
on GN under which GN is a graded Fréchet space of almost universal
disposition for ﬁnite-dimensional Fréchet spaces. Our construction uses
the following result being a special case of Theorem 6.5 in [3]; property
(2) below appears also as condition (‡) on page 765 in [3].
It turns
out that condition (2) determines π uniquely up to linear isometries,
although this fact was not proved in [3].

Theorem 2.1. There exists a non-expansive linear operator π : G → G
with the following properties.

(1) For every non-expansive operator T : X → G with X a separable
Banach space, there exists an isometric embedding i : X → G
such that T = π ◦ i.

(2) For every ε > 0, for every ﬁnite-dimensional normed spaces
E ⊆ F , for every non-expansive linear operator T : F → G, for
every isometric embedding e : E → G such that T ↾ E = π ◦ e,
there exists an ε-isometric embedding f : F → G such that

kf ↾ E − ek ≤ ε

and

kπ ◦ f − T k ≤ ε.

Furthermore, ker π is linearly isometric to G.

The last proposition may be applied to obtain the following useful

Proposition 2.2. The operator π from Theorem 2.1 is a projection
and it satisﬁes the following condition:

(2′) For every ε > 0, for every ﬁnite-dimensional normed spaces
E ⊆ F , for every non-expansive linear operator T : E → G, for

4

C. BARGETZ, J. KĄKOL, AND W. KUBIŚ

every isometric embedding e : E → G such that T ↾ E = π ◦ e,
there exists an ε-isometric embedding f : F → G such that

f ↾ E = e

and

π ◦ f = T.

Proof. Taking T = idG in Theorem 2.1, we see that π is a projection.
From now on, we shall identify the range of π with a suitable subspace
In order to show (2′), we need to use the following
of its domain.
fact which is easy to prove (see the proof of [6, Theorem 2.7] for more
details).

Claim 2.3. Let F be a ﬁnite-dimensional normed space and let S =
{v0, . . . , vn} be a linear basis of F . Then for every ε > 0 there exists
δ > 0 such that for every pair of linear operators f, g : F → X into an
arbitrary Banach space X, the following implication holds:

max
v∈S

kf (v) − g(v)k ≤ δ =⇒ kf − gk ≤ ε.

Now assume that E ⊆ F and S ∩ E is a linear basis of E. Fix ε > 0
and let δ > 0 be as mentioned in the claim. We apply property (2)
from Theorem 2.1 with δ instead of ε. This provides a map f : F → G.
Deﬁne f ′ so that f ′ ↾ E = e and f ′(v) = f (v) for every v ∈ S \E. These
conditions specify f ′ uniquely and by the claim we have that f ′ is a
2ε-isometric embedding. Furthermore, we have that kπ ◦ f ′ − T k ≤ 2ε.
We have proved that for every r > 0 there is an r-isometric embedding
f : F → G extending e and such that kπ ◦ f − T k ≤ r. Let us use this
fact for r = δ, where δ and ε are as before. We obtain a δ-isometric
embedding f : F → G extending e and satisfying kπ ◦ f − T k ≤ δ. Fix
v ∈ S \ E. Then the vector wv = π(f (v)) − T (v) has norm ≤ δ. Deﬁne
f ′ : F → G so that f ′ ↾ E = f and

f ′(v) = f (v) − wv,

v ∈ S \ E.

Note that kf ′(v) − f (v)k ≤ δ for v ∈ S, therefore kf ′ − f k ≤ ε. Finally,
πf ′(v) = πf (v) − πf (v) + πT (v) = T (v). It follows that πf ′ = T . (cid:3)

Now we are ready to construct a graded sequence of semi-norms on
GN. Having in mind the last two results mentioned above, we conclude
that there is a norm k · k2 on the product G × G ∼= (im π) × (ker π)
satisfying

kxkG = k(x, y)k1 ≤ k(x, y)k2

since x = π(x, y) and π is non-expansive. In addition, (G2, k · k2) is
isometric to G. We identify G × G with G and use the notation π2
for π in this case to stress that we consider it as mapping from G2 to
G. Inductively, for all n ∈ N, we get a norm k · kn on Gn satisfying
kxk1 ≤ · · · ≤ kxkn−1 ≤ kxkn for all x ∈ Gn and (Gn, k · kn) is isometric

A SEPARABLE FRÉCHET SPACE OF ALMOST UNIVERSAL DISPOSITION 5

to G. Therefore this construction provides an increasing sequence of
semi-norms on GN as claimed. We use the notation πn : Gn → Gn−1
for the universal operator π if we want to stress that we consider it
as projection from Gn to Gn−1, i.e., a projection onto the ﬁrst n − 1
components.

In order to formulate a condition similar to (G) for Fréchet spaces
we need to deﬁne the corresponding concept of ε-isometries for Fréchet
spaces.

Deﬁnition 2.4. Let (X, {k·ki}i∈N) and (Y, {k·ki}i∈N) be Fréchet spaces
with ﬁxed sequences of semi-norms. A mapping f : X → Y is called
an ε-isometric embedding iﬀ it is an embedding and

(1)

(1 + ε)−1kxki ≤ kf (x)ki ≤ (1 + ε)kxki

holds for all i ∈ N an all x ∈ X. The mapping f is called an isometric
embedding iﬀ

(2)

kf (x)ki = kxki

holds for all i ∈ N an all x ∈ X.

Now we are ready to formulate the analogue of condition (G) for

Fréchet spaces.

Deﬁnition 2.5. A Fréchet space E is of almost universal disposi-
tion for ﬁnite-dimensional Fréchet spaces if for all ε > 0 and for all
ﬁnite-dimensional Fréchet spaces X ⊆ Y with an isometric embedding
f0 : X → E there exists an ε-isometric embedding f : Y → E satisfying
f ↾ E = f0.

3. A graded Fréchet space of almost universal

disposition

We show that the space GN equipped with the graded sequence
{k · kn}n∈N of semi-norms deﬁned above (coming from the universal op-
erator π) is of almost universal disposition for ﬁnite-dimensional graded
Fréchet spaces. We need the following

Lemma 3.1. Let (X, {k · ki}i∈N and (Y, {k · ki}i∈N) be Fréchet spaces
with ﬁxed semi-norms and ι : X → Y an isometric embedding. Then
for all i ∈ N the mapping

ιi : X/ ker k · ki → Y / ker k · ki, ¯x 7→ ι(x)

is a well-deﬁned isometric embedding. Moreover, the diagram

6

is commutative.

Proof. As ι is an isometric embedding, we have kι(x)ki = kxki. Hence
x ∈ ker k · ki iﬀ ι(x) ∈ ker k · ki, i.e. ιi is well-deﬁned. By deﬁnition we
have

kιi(¯x)ki = (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)ι(x)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)i

= kι(x)ki = kxki = k¯xki

and hence ιi is an isometric embedding. The commutativity of the
diagram directly follows from the deﬁnition of ιi.
(cid:3)

In addition, we also need the following technical

Lemma 3.2. Let X ⊆ Y and A be ﬁnite-dimensional Banach spaces,
Z a Banach space, e : X → A an isometric embedding, T : Y → Z a
linear operator with kT k ≤ r, r > 1, and π : A → Z a non-expansive
operator such that the diagram

commutes. There exists a ﬁnite-dimensional Banach space C, an iso-
metric embedding iA : A → C, an (r − 1)-isometric embedding iY : Y →
C and a non-expansive operator π′ : C → Z such that the diagram

Proof. We deﬁne C := (A ⊕ Y )/∆ with ∆ = {(e(x), −x) : x ∈ X}
equipped with the norm

k(a, y)k = inf
x∈X

{ka − e(x)kA + rkx + ykY }.

A SEPARABLE FRÉCHET SPACE OF ALMOST UNIVERSAL DISPOSITION 7

First we show that iA is an isometry. For a ∈ A we obtain

kiA(a)k = inf
x∈X

x∈X
≥ inf
x∈X

{ka − e(x)kA + rkxkY }

{ka − e(x)kA + ke(x)kA + (r − 1)kxkY }

{kakA + (r − 1)kxkY } = kakA

and, by setting x = 0, kiA(a)k ≤ kakA. For y ∈ Y we get

kiY (y)k = k(0, y)k = inf
x∈X

{k − e(x)kA + rkx + ykY } ≤ rkykY

by setting x = 0, and

kiY (y)k = inf
x∈X
= inf
x∈X

{k − e(x)kA + rkx + ykY }

{k − xkY + ky + xkY + (r − 1)kx + ykY }

≥ inf
x∈X

{kykY + (r − 1)kx + ykY } ≥ kykY ≥

again using the triangle inequality. The linear operator π′ : A → Z can
be deﬁned as
π′((a, y)) = π(a − e(x)) + T (x + y) = π(a) − π(e(x)) + T (x) + T (y)

= π(a) + T (y).

It satisﬁes

kπ′((a, y))kZ = kπ′((a − e(x), x + y))kZ

≤ kπ(a − e(x))kZ + kT (x + y)kZ
≤ ka − e(x)kA + rkx + ykY

for all x ∈ X and hence kπ′((a, y))k ≤ k(a, y)k.

Theorem 3.3. The space GN equipped with the graded sequence

{k · kn}n∈N

of semi-norms deﬁned above is of almost universal disposition for ﬁnite-
dimensional graded Fréchet spaces.

a sequence (εi)i∈N satisfying Q∞

Proof. Given an isometric embedding f : X → GN and ε > 0, we choose
i=1(1 + εi) < 1 + ε. We will use the
notation Xi := X/ ker k · ki, Yi := Y / ker k · ki. By fi : Xi → Gi we
denote the mapping induced by the isometric embedding f : X → GN.
As a ﬁrst step, we can use that X1 ⊆ Y1 are ﬁnite-dimensional Ba-
nach spaces and f1 : X1 → G is an isometric embedding to obtain an
ε1-isometric embedding g1 : Y1 → G which extends f1.

Now assume that we already have constructed a δ-isometric embed-

where 1 + δ = Qn−1

We consider the diagram

commutes and π′ is non-expansive. From Proposition 2.2, we may
now conclude that there is an εn-isometric emebedding ˜gn : C → Gn
which extends both fn and π′. Hence gn = ˜gn ◦ ιYn is an δ′-isometric
i=1(1 + εi), which extends both fn and

embedding, where 1 + δ′ = Qn

gn−1.

Therefore by induction we get an ε-isometric embedding g : Y → GN
(cid:3)

extending the embedding f : X → GN.

4. Uniqueness and Universality

The aim of this section is to prove universality and the following

uniqueness result for the space GN.

Proposition 4.1. Let E and F be graded Fréchet spaces which are
of almost universal disposition for ﬁnite-dimensional graded Fréchet
spaces, ε > 0, X ⊆ E a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace and f : X → F an
ε-isometric embedding. Then there exists a bijective isometry h : E →
F satisfying kh(x) − f (x)ki < 4εkxki for all i ∈ N.

First we need to show some additional lemmata used for the proof.
Let (X, {k · ki}i∈N) and (Y, {k · ki}i∈N) be Fréchet spaces with a ﬁxed
sequence of semi-norms and f : X → Y a linear mapping with the
property that for all i ∈ N there exists a constant Ci > 0 such that

A SEPARABLE FRÉCHET SPACE OF ALMOST UNIVERSAL DISPOSITION 9

kf (x)ki ≤ Cikxki holds for all x ∈ X. We can do this since we only
want to consider mappings which are isometries or at least ε-isometries.

We can now deﬁne

kf ki = sup
kxki=1

kf (x)ki

for all i ∈ N. Note that the above condition on f is stronger than the
continuity of f .

We need the following Lemma motivated by [7, Lemma 2.2] for Ba-

nach spaces.

Lemma 4.2. Let (X, {k·kX,i}i∈N) and (Y, {k·kY,i}i∈N) be ﬁnite-dimensional
graded Fréchet spaces and let ε > 0 and f : X → Y be an ε-isometric
embedding. There exists a ﬁnite-dimensional graded Fréchet space Z
and isometric embeddings ι : X → Z and j : Y → Z such that kj ◦ f −
ιki ≤ ε holds for all i ∈ N.

Proof. We set Z = X ⊕ Y equipped with the semi-norms

k(x, y)ki = inf{kukX,i + kvkY,i + εkwkX,i : x = u + w,

y = v − f (w), u, w ∈ X, v ∈ Y }.

We have

kj(f (x)) − ι(x)ki = k(x, −f (x))ki ≤ εkxkX,i

by taking u = 0, v = 0 and w = x. Hence kj ◦ f − ιki ≤ ε for all i ∈ N.
From

1

1 + ε

≥ 1 − ε ⇔ 1 ≥ 1 − ε2

we may deduce kf (x)kY,i ≥ (1 + ε)−1kxkX,i ≥ (1 − ε)kxkX,i which
we will need in the following. Now we show that ι is an isometric
embedding. For x ∈ X we have

kι(x)ki = k(x, 0)ki ≤ kxkX,i.

Setting x = u + w and 0 = v − f (w), we obtain

kukX,i + kvkY,i + εkwkX,i = kukX,i + kf (w)kY,i + εkwkX,i

≥ kukX,i + (1 − ε)kwkX,i + εkwkX,i
= kukX,i + kwkX,i ≥ ku + wkX,i = kxkX,i

and hence kι(x)ki = k(x, 0)ki ≥ kxkX,i. Therefore ι is an isometric em-
bedding. Analogously to above, we have kj(y)ki = k(0, y)ki ≤ kykY,i.

10

C. BARGETZ, J. KĄKOL, AND W. KUBIŚ

Setting 0 = u + w and y = v − f (w), we obtain

kukX,i + kvkY,i + εkwkX,i = kwkX,i + kvkY,i + εkwkX,i

= (1 + ε)kwkX,i + kvkY,i
≥ kf (w)kY,i + kvkY,i
≥ kf (w) − vkY,i = kykY,i

and hence kj(y)ki = k(0, y)ki ≥ kykY,i, i.e.
embedding.

j is also an isometric
(cid:3)

We need also the next

Lemma 4.3. Let E be a graded Fréchet space which is of almost uni-
versal disposition for ﬁnite-dimensional graded Fréchet spaces, X ⊆ E
a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace and ε > 0. Given an ε-isometry f : X →
Y , for all δ > 0 there exists a δ-isometry g : Y → E with the property
kg ◦ f − idX kX,i < 2ε for all i ∈ N.
Proof. Choose 0 < δ′ < min{δ, 1}. By Lemma 4.2 there exists a ﬁnite-
dimensional Fréchet space Z and isometric embeddings ι : X → Z and
j : Y → Z such that kj ◦ f − ιki ≤ ε for all i ∈ N. As E is of almost
universal disposition for ﬁnite-dimensional Fréchet spaces, there exists
a δ′-isometric embedding h : Z → E with the property h ◦ ι ↾ X = idX.
Setting g = h ◦ j, we get that g is a δ-isometric embedding as it is the
composition of a δ-isometric embedding with an isometric embedding.
Additionally for x ∈ X we obtain
kg(f (x)) − xki = kh(j(f (x))) − h(ι(x))ki ≤ (1 + δ′)kj(f (x)) − ι(x)ki

≤ ε(1 + δ′)kxki < 2εkxki

for all i ∈ N.

(cid:3)

Now we can use these results to show that GN is, up to isometry,
uniquely determined by the property of being of almost universal dis-
position for ﬁnite-dimensional Fréchet spaces.

Proof of Proposition 4.1. Let {εn}n∈N be a ﬁxed sequence of positive
real numbers satisfying a decay condition which will be speciﬁed later
in the proof.

We pick ε0 = ε and set X0 = X, Y0 = Y and f0 = f . By assumption

the mapping f0 : X0 → Y0 is an ε0-isometric embedding.

Now assume that Xi, Yi and fi have already been constructed for
i ≤ n and that also the mappings gi have been constructed for i < n.
Using Lemma 4.3 we obtain an εn+1-isometric embedding gn : Yn →
Xn+1 satisfying

(3)

kgn(fn(x)) − xki ≤ 2εnkxki

A SEPARABLE FRÉCHET SPACE OF ALMOST UNIVERSAL DISPOSITION 11

for all i ∈ N. Here the space Xn+1 is deﬁned as an appropriately

enlarged gn[Yn] such that Yn−1 ⊆ Yn and Sn∈N Xn is dense in E. Again

by using Lemma 4.3 we get an εn+1-isometric embedding fn+1 : Xn+1 →
Yn+1 where Yn+1 is chosen analogously to Xn+1. This mapping satisﬁes

(4)

kfn+1(gn(y)) − yki ≤ 2εn+1kyki

for all i ∈ N.

Now for ﬁxed n and x ∈ Xn we get

kfn+1(gn(fn(x))) − fn(x)ki ≤ 2εn+1kfn(x)ki ≤ 2εn+1(1 + εn)kxki

and

kfn+1(gn(fn(x))) − fn+1(x)ki ≤ (1 + εn+1)kgn(fn(x)) − xki

≤ 2εn(1 + εn+1)kxki.

Using the triangle inequality, we obtain

kfn+1(x) − fn(x)ki ≤ (εn + 2εnεn+1 + εn+1)2kxki

from the inequalities above. Now we assume that

ε0 + 2ε0ε1 + ε1 +

∞X

n=1

(εn + 2εnεn+1 + εn+1) < 2ε

which implies that {f (xn)}n∈N is a Cauchy sequence in F .

For x ∈ Sn∈N Xn we deﬁne h(x) = limm≥n fn(x) where m is chosen

such that x ∈ Xm. Then h is an εn-isometry for all n ∈ N and hence an
isometry which can be uniquely extended to an isometry on E, which
will be denoted by h as well. From the inequalities above we deduce

kf (x) − h(x)ki ≤ 2

∞X

n=0

(εn + 2εnεn+1 + εn+1) < 4ε.

In order to show that h is bijective, we repeat the above procedure to
show that {gn(y)}n≥m is a Cauchy sequence for all y ∈ Ym. Again we
may obtain an isometry g∞ : F → E. From the conditions (3) and (4)
we may conclude g∞ ◦ h = idE and h ◦ g∞ = idF .
(cid:3)

We conclude this section by showing that every graded Fréchet space

can be embedded isometrically into GN.

Theorem 4.4. The space GN is universal for separable Fréchet spaces.

Proof. Let X be a separable Fréchet space and {k · ki}i∈N its ﬁxed se-
quence of semi-norms. For all i ∈ N we denote by Xi the normed space

X/ ker k · ki equipped with the norm k · ki and by fXi its completion.

From the universality of G we may deduce the existence of an isometric

12

C. BARGETZ, J. KĄKOL, AND W. KUBIŚ

embedding f1 : eX1 → G. Now assume that we have an isometric em-
bedding fi : eXi → Gi. Note that since kxki ≤ kxki+1 for all x ∈ X, the

composition T of fi with the canonical mapping cani+1
: Xi+1 → Xi is
non-expansive. As Gi+1, equipped with the semi-norm k·k′
i+1, is isomet-
ric to G, we can use property (1) of the universal projection πi+1 given

i

in Theorem 2.1 to ﬁnd an isometric embedding fi+1 : eXi+1 → Gi+1 so

that the diagram

f : X → GN,

x 7→ ((fi(cani(x)))i)i∈N

is an isometric embedding.

(cid:3)

5. Final remarks

Note that by [13, Proposition V.5.4] the space C(R) is universal for
all separable Fréchet spaces. The following shows that, like in the case
of C([0, 1]) for Banach spaces, the space C(R) is not of almost universal
disposition for ﬁnite-dimensional Fréchet spaces.
Proposition 5.1. Let X be a hemicompact space and {Ki}i∈N be a

sequence of compact sets satisfying Ki ⊆ Ki+1 and Si∈N Ki = X.

The space C(X) equipped with the sequence of semi-norms k · ki where
kf ki = supx∈Ki |f (x)| is not of almost universal disposition for ﬁnite-
dimensional Fréchet spaces.

Proof. Assume for a contradiction that C(X) is a of almost universal
disposition for ﬁnite-dimensional Fréchet spaces. By Proposition 4.1
we deduce that C(X) ∼= GN holds isometrically. Hence for all i ∈ N we
obtain C(X)/ ker k·ki ∼= G isometrically. Observe that C(X)/ ker k·ki =
C(Ki). This shows that C(K)-space is a Gurari˘ı space, a contradiction
with [1, Corollary 5.4].

Proposition 5.2. There is no separable Fréchet space which is of uni-
versal disposition for ﬁnite-dimensional Fréchet spaces.

Proof. Assume, for a contradiction, that F is a separable Fréchet space
of universal disposition for ﬁnite-dimensional Fréchet spaces. Hence
F is also of almost universal disposition for ﬁnite-dimensional Fréchet
spaces, and hence by Proposition 4.1 isometrically isomorphic to GN.
Therefore it is suﬃcient to show that GN is not of universal disposition.

A SEPARABLE FRÉCHET SPACE OF ALMOST UNIVERSAL DISPOSITION 13

Let X ⊆ Y be ﬁnite-dimensional Banach spaces. Setting k · kX,i :=
k · kX and k · kY,i := k · kY for all i ∈ N, we obtain two ﬁnite-dimensional
Fréchet spaces. Assume, for a contradiction, that GN is of universal
disposition for ﬁnite-dimensional Fréchet spaces. Given an isometric
embedding f : (X, k · kX) → G the product mapping

X → GN, x 7→ {f (x)}i∈N

is an isometric embedding of Fréchet spaces. Hence there would exist
an isometric extension g : Y → GN. Therefore also the mapping Y →
G, y 7→ (g(y))1 is an isometry since G = GN/ ker k · k1 and it extends
f . This would mean that G is a separable Banach space of universal
disposition for ﬁnite-dimensional Banach spaces, in contradiction to [6,
Proposition 5.1].
(cid:3)

We conclude the paper with the construction of a sequence of semi-
norms on GN under which it is of almost universal disposition for
Fréchet spaces with a ﬁxed but not necessarily increasing sequence
of semi-norms.

For this we can use the semi-norms coming from the coordinates,
namely, for each n ∈ N deﬁne kxk′
n = kx(n)kG, x ∈ GN, where k · kG
is the norm of the Gurari˘ı space. We will not prove that this space is
unique and universal as these proofs follow the lines of the correspond-
ing ones for graded Fréchet spaces.

In order to shorten the notation, we denote by Xi := X/ ker k · ki
equipped with the norm k · ki and by Yi the corresponding quotient of
Y .

In order to show that GN with these semi-norms is of almost universal

disposition, we need the following

Lemma 5.3. Let f0 : X → GN be an (ε-)isometric embedding. For all
i ∈ N the mapping

f i
0 : Xi → G, ¯x 7→ (f0(x))i

is an (ε-)isometric embedding and the diagram

Q(X/ ker k · ki)

Q f i
0

GN

f0

X

is commutative.

Proof. First we show that

f i
0 : Xi → G, ¯x 7→ (f0(x))i

is well-deﬁned. Let x1, x2 ∈ X such that kx1 − x2ki = 0. Then

k(f0(x1))i − (f0(x2))ik = k(f0(x1 − x2))ik ≤ (1 + ε)kx1 − x2ki = 0

0(¯xk·ki) for i ∈ N follows analogously.

and hence (f0(x1))i = (f0(x2))i, i.e. the mapping is well-deﬁned. It is
by deﬁnition an (ε-)isometric embedding. Finally note that the identity
(f0(x))i = f i
(cid:3)
Proposition 5.4. Let (X, {k · ki}i∈N) and (Y, {k · ki}i∈N) be ﬁnite-
dimensional Fréchet spaces with ﬁxed semi-norms, ε > 0, ι : X → Y
and f0 : X → GN isometric embeddings. Then there is an ε-isometric
embedding f : Y → GN such that the diagram

f0

GN

f

X

Y

is commutative.

Proof. As X and Y are ﬁnite-dimensional, the quotient spaces Xi and
Yi are ﬁnite-dimensional Banach spaces for all i ∈ N. By Lemma 3.1
the mappings ιi : Xi → Yi are isometric embeddings. The same is true
for the mappings f i
0 : Xi → G by Lemma 5.3. As the Gurari˘ı space
is of almost universal disposition for ﬁnite-dimensional Banach spaces,
there is an ε-isometric embedding fi : Yi → G making the diagram

f i

commutative. For y ∈ Y , we set f (y) = {fi(yk·ki)}i∈N, i.e. f is deﬁned
so that

Q Yi

Q fi

f

is commutative. Since fi is an ε-isometric embedding for all i ∈ N, we
get

kf (y)k′

i = k(f (y))ik = kfi(yk·ki)k ≤ (1 + ε)k¯yki = (1 + ε)kyki

and by an analogous computation kf (y)k′
ε-isometric embedding. Now let x ∈ X, we have

i ≥ (1 + ε)−1kyki, i.e. f is an

(f (ι(x)))i = fi(cid:16)ι(x)

k·ki(cid:17) = fi(ιi(¯x)) = f i

0(¯x) = (f0(x))i.

Hence f (ι(x)) = f0(x), i.e. f ↾ X = f0.

Remark 5.5. Note that in both cases GN/ ker k · kn = Gn. Therefore
all neighbourhoods of zero contain straight lines. This means in other
words that there is no continuous norm on the space GN equipped with
either of the sequences of semi-norms.
