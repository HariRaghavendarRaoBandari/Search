Abstract. Given a symmetric non degenerated bilinear form b on a vector space
V , G. Pinczon and R. Ushirobira deﬁned a bracket { , } on the space of multilinear
skewsymmetric forms on V . With this bracket, the quadratic Lie algebra structure
equation on (V, b) becomes simply {Ω, Ω} = 0.

We characterize similarly quadratic associative, commutative or pre-Lie struc-
tures on (V, b) by the same equation {Ω, Ω} = 0, but on diﬀerent spaces of forms.
These deﬁnitions extend to quadratic up to homotopy algebras and allows to de-
scribe the corresponding cohomologies.

1. Introduction

In [PU, DPU] (see also [D, MPU]), Georges Pinczon and Rosane Ushirobira intro-
duced what they called a Poisson bracket on the space of skewsymmetric forms on
a ﬁnite dimensional vector space V , equipped with a symmetric, non degenerated,
bilinear form b.
j) the basis deﬁned by the relations
b(e′

If (ei) is a basis in V and (e′

j, ei) = δij, the bracket is:

{α, β} =Xi

ιeiα ∧ ιe′

i

β.

Especially, if α is a (k + 1)-form, and β a (k′ + 1), then {α, β} is a (k + k′)-form.
Shifting the degree on V by -1, we replace V by V [1], the skew-symmetric bilinear
forms on V becomes symmetric forms on V [1] and the bracket { , } a Lie bracket.

In fact, the authors proved that a structure of quadratic Lie algebra (V, [ ,

], b)
on V is completely characterized by a 3-form I, such that {I, I} = 0. The relation
between the Lie bracket and I is simply I(x, y, z) = b([x, y], z), and the equation
{I, I} = 0 is the structure equation. A direct consequence of this construction is the
existence of a cohomology on the space of forms, given by:

dα = {α, I}.

This cohomology characterizes the problem of deﬁnition and deformation of quadratic
Lie algebra structure on (V, b).

In this paper, we ﬁrst generalize this construction, deﬁning the Pinczon bracket
on the space C(V ) of cyclic multilinear forms on the shifted space V [1]. A Pinczon
bracket on C(V ) is a Lie bracket (Ω, Ω′) 7→ {Ω, Ω′} such that {Ω, Ω′} is (k + k′)-linear,
if Ω is (k + 1)-linear, and Ω′ (k′ + 1)-linear, and, for each linear form α, {α, } is a
derivation of the cyclic product.

As in [PU], there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of Pinczon brackets
on C(V ) and the set of non degenerated, bilinear symmetric forms b on V , and the
correspondence is given through the Pinczon-Ushirobira formula:

{Ω, Ω′} =Xi

ιeiΩ ⊙ ιe′

i

Ω′.

On the other hand, it is well known that the space N+ V [1] is a cogebra for the

comultiplication given by the deconcatenation map:

∆(x1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ xk) =

k−1

Xi=1
(x1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ xi)O(xi+1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ xk).

Moreover, the coderivations of ∆ are characterized by their Taylor series (Qk) where

Qk : Nk V [1] −→ V [1], and the bracket [Q, Q′] of two such coderivation is still a

coderivation.

Suppose now there is a symmetric non degenerated form b on V . Denotes B the
corresponding form, but on V [1]. T here is a bijective map between C(V ) and the
space DB of B-quadratic coderivation Q, given by the formula:

ΩQ(x1, . . . , xk+1) = B(Q(x1, . . . , xk), xk+1).

This map is an isomorphism of Lie algebra: {ΩQ, ΩQ′} = Ω[Q,Q′].

With this construction, the notion of quadratic associative algebra, respectively
quadratic associative algebra up to homotopy does coincide with the notion of Pinc-
zon algebra structure on C(V ). This gives also an explicit way to reﬁnd the Hochschild
cohomology deﬁned by the algebra structure.

Moreover, the subspace Cvsp(V ) of cyclic, vanishing on shuﬄe products forms is
a Lie subalgebra of C(V ). The restriction to this subalgebra of the above construc-
tion gives us the notion of quadratic commutative algebra (up to homotopy): it is a
Pinczon algebra structure on Cvsp(V ). Similarly, one reﬁnds the Harrison cohomology
associated to commutative algebras.

A natural quotient of (C(V ), { , }) is the Lie algebra (S, { , }|) of totally symmetric
multilinear forms on V [1]. This allows us to reﬁnd the notion of quadratic Lie algebra
(up to homotopy), and the corresponding Chevalley cohomology.

Considering now bi-symmetric mulitlinear forms on V [1]: i.e. separatly symmetric
in their two last variables and in all their other variables, and extending canonically
the Pinczon bracket to a bracket { , }+ on this space of forms, we can deﬁne sim-
ilarly quadratic pre-Lie algebra structures on (V, b), and the corresponding pre-Lie
cohomology.

Finally, we study the natural example of the space of n × n matrices. An unpub-

lished preprint ([A]) contains a part of these results.

2. Cyclic forms

2.1. Koszul’s rule.

In this paper, V is a ﬁnite dimensional graded vector space, on a charateristic 0

ﬁeld K. Denote |x| the degree of a vector x in V .

First recall the sign rule due to Koszul (see [Ko]). For any relation between quanti-
ties using letters representing homogeneous objects, in diﬀerent orderings, it is always
understood that there is an implicit + sign in front of the ﬁrst term. For each other
term, if σ is the permutation of the letters between the ﬁrst quantity and the con-
sidered term, there is the implicit sign ε|letters|(σ) (the sign of σ, taking into account
only positions of the odd degree letters) in front of it.

As usual, V [1] is the space V with a shifted degree. If x is homogeneous, its de-
gree in V [1] is deg(x) = |x| − 1. Note simply x for deg(x) when no confusion is
possible. Very generally, we use a small letter for each mapping deﬁned on V , and
capital letter for the ‘corresponding’ mapping, deﬁned on V [1]. Let us deﬁne now
these corresponding mappings.

For any k, deﬁne a ‘k-cocycle’ η by putting η(x1, . . . , xk) = (−1)Pj≤k(k−j)xj . Then,

if ε(σ) is the sign of the permutation σ in Sk,

η(xσ(1), . . . , xσ(k))η(x1, . . . , xk) = ε(σ)ε|x|(σ)εx(σ).

If q is a k-linear mapping from V k into a graded vector space W , deﬁne the asso-

ciated k-linear mapping from V [1]k into W [1], with deg(Q) = |q| + k − 1, by

Q(x1, . . . , xk) = η(x1, . . . , xk)q(x1, . . . , xk).

Prefering to keep the 0 degree for scalars, if ω is a k-linear form on V , the same
formula associates to ω a form Ω, on V [1], with degree deg(Ω) = |ω| + k.

4

D. ARNAL, W. BAKBRAHEM, AND M. SELMI

This shift of degree modiﬁes the symmetry properties of these mappings. For in-

stance, if q is σ-invariant, then Q is σ skew-invariant.

2.2. Pinczon bracket.

It is deﬁned on cyclic forms.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let Ω be a (k + 1)-linear form, Ω is a cyclic form on V [1], if it
satisﬁes:

Denote C(V ) the space of cyclic forms on V [1].

Ω(xk+1, x1, . . . , xk) = Ω(x1, . . . , xk+1).

Let σ ∈ Sk and Ω k-linear. Put (Ωσ)(x1, . . . , xk) = Ω(xσ−1(1), . . . , xσ−1(k)). Denote

Cycl the subgroup of Sk generated by the cycle (1, 2, . . . , k). Put

ΩCycl = Xτ ∈Cycl

Ωτ ,

and A ⊙ B = (A ⊗ B)Cycl.

It is easy to prove that the so deﬁned cyclic product is commutative, but non as-

sociative.

Deﬁnition 2.2. A Pinczon bracket { , } on the space C(V ) of cyclic multilinear
forms on a graded space V [1] is a bilinear map such that

1. If Ck is the space of k-linear cyclic forms, {Ck+1, Ck′+1} ⊂ Ck+k′,
2. C(V ), equipped with { , } is a graded Lie algebra, with center C0,
3. for any linear form α, {α, } is a derivation: if β1, . . . , βk are linear,

{α, (β1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ βk)Cycl} =Xj

{α, βj}(β1 ⊗ . . . ˆβj . . . ⊗ βk)Cycl,

Now,

Proposition 2.3.

1. There is a bijective map between the set P of Pinczon
bracket on C(V ) and the set B of degree 0, symmetric, non degenerated bilinear
forms b on V ,

2. Let b be in B, and (ei) a basis for V , if (e′

i) is the basis deﬁned by b(ei, e′

j) = δij,

then the Pinczon bracket associated to b is:

{Ω, Ω′} =Xi

ιeiΩ ⊙ ιe′

i

Ω′.

Proof. Let { , } be a Pinczon bracket on C(V ), then {C0, C(V )} = 0, and {C1, C1} ⊂
K. The bracket deﬁnes a degree 0 bilinear, antisymmetric form B⋆ on C1 = (V [1])⋆.
As above this deﬁnes a symmetric bilinear form b⋆ on the space V ⋆ = (V [1])⋆[1].

PINCZON ALGEBRAS

Suppose that for some α in C1, B⋆(α, C1) = {α, C1} = 0. Since {α, } is a derivation,
{α, Ck} = 0, and α is a central element. Thus α = 0, b⋆ is non degenerated and al-
lows to identify V ⋆ and V and b⋆ to a non degenerated bilinear symmetric form b on V .

Let B⋆ be a skewsymmetric bilinear form on (V [1])⋆. For any basis (ei) of V [1]

there are vectors e′

i such that:

B⋆(α, β) =Xi

ιeiα ⊗ ιe′

i

β =Xi

α(ei)β(e′

i) =Xi

ιeiα ⊙ ιe′

i

β.

Coming back to V ⋆ this means, if all the objects are homogeneous,

b⋆(α, β) =Xi

(−1)|β|α(ei)β(e′

i).

Identify V ⋆ to V by deﬁning, for any γ in V ⋆, the vector xγ in V such that α(xγ) =
b⋆(α, γ), for any α in V ⋆. Then e′
i = xǫi, where (ǫi) is the dual basis of (ei). Therefore
(e′

j, ei) = δij.

i) is a basis for V , and b(e′
Consider now the bracket:

{Ω, Ω′}P =Xi

ιeiΩ ⊙ ιe′

i

Ω′,

where Ω is a k + 1-linear cyclic form and Ω′ a k′ + 1-linear one. In a following section,
we shall prove this bracket deﬁnes a graded Lie algebra structure on C(V ). It is clear
that, for any α and βj linear,

{α, (β1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ βk)Cycl}P =Xj

{α, βj}P (β1 ⊗ . . . ˆβj . . . ⊗ βk)Cycl.

Moreover the center of the Lie algebra (C(V ), { , }P ) is C0. In other word, { , }P is
a Pinczon bracket.

If k + k′ ≤ 0, {Ω, Ω′} = {Ω, Ω′}P . Suppose by induction this relation holds for

k + k′ < N and consider Ω and Ω′ such that k + k′ = N. For any i,
{ǫi, {Ω, Ω′}} = −{Ω, {Ω′, ǫi}P }P − {Ω′, {ǫi, Ω}P }P = {ǫi, {Ω, Ω′}P }P = ιe′

i{Ω, Ω′}P

On the other hand, if {Ω, Ω′} =Pβ(β1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ βk+k′)Cycl,

i)(β1 ⊗ . . . ˆβj . . . ⊗ βk+k′)Cycl = ιe′

βj(e′

{Ω, Ω′}.

i

{ǫi, {Ω, Ω′}} =Xβ,j

This proves the existence and unicity, and gives the form of the Pinczon bracket
associated to the symmetric, non degenerated bilinear form b on V .

3.1. General construction.

The deconcatenation ∆ is a natural comultiplication in the tensor algebraN+ V [1]:

k−1

∆(x1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ xk) =

Xr=1

(x1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ xr)O(xr+1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ xk).

The space D of coderivations of ∆ is a natural graded Lie algebra for the commutator.
It is well known (see for instance [K, LM]) that any multilinear mapping Q can
be extended in an unique way into a coderivation DQ of ∆, and conversely any

coderivation D has an unique form D = Pk DQk. Thus the space of multilinear

mappings is a graded Lie algebra for the bracket [Q, Q′] = Q ◦ Q′ − Q′ ◦ Q, where, if
x[a,b] = xa ⊗ xa+1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ xb,

Q ◦ Q′(x[1,k+k′−1]) =

k−1

Xr=0

Q(x[1,r], Q′(x[r+1,r+k′]), x[r+k′+1,k+k′−1]).

3.2. Relation with the Pinczon bracket.

Consider a vector space V equipped with a symmetric, non degenerated bilinear
form b, with degree 0, denote B the associated form on V [1]. For any linear map
Q : V [1]k → V [1], deﬁne the (k + 1)-linear form:

ΩQ(x1, . . . , xk+1) = B(Q(x1, . . . , xk), xk+1),

and let us say that Q is B-quadratic if ΩQ is cyclic. Denote DB the space of B-
quadratic multilinear maps.

The fundamental examples of cyclic maps are mappings associated to a Lie bracket
or an associative multiplication on V . More precisely, if (x, y) 7→ q(x, y) is any internal
law, with degree 0, and Q(x, y) = (−1)xq(x, y), then ΩQ is cyclic if and only if:

if and only if (V, q, b) is a quadratic algebra.

b(q(x, y), z) = b(x, q(y, z)),

Remark that if q is a Lie bracket, then ΩQ is symmetric. Now, if q is a commutative
(and associative) product, then ΩQ is vanishing on the image of the shuﬄe product
on the 2 ﬁrst variables:

sh(1,1)(x1 ⊗ x2) = (x1 ⊗ x2) + (x2 ⊗ x1).

Proposition 3.1. The space DB of B-quadratic maps Q is a Lie subalgebra of D.

The space C(V ) of cyclic forms, equipped with the Pinczon bracket is a graded Lie

algebra, isomorphic to DB.

Proof. For any sequence I = {i1, . . . , ik} of indices, denote xI the tensor xi1 ⊗. . .⊗xik .

Suppose Q is k-linear, Q′ k′-linear, both B-quadratic. Thus:

B(Q(x[1,k]), Q′(x]k,k+k′])) = −B(Q′(Q(x[1,k]), x]k,k+k′−1]), xk+k′)

= B(Q(Q′(x]k,k+k′]), x[1,k−1]), xk).

Therefore:

B(Q(x[2,r], Q′(x]r,r+k′]), x]r+k′,k+k′]), x1)

B(Q(x[1,r], Q′(x]r,r+k′]), x]r+k′,k+k′−1]), xk+k′) − B(Q′(Q(x[1,k]), x]k,k+k′−1]), xk+k′)

B(Q ◦ Q′(x[2,k+k′]), x1) =X1≤r
= X1≤r<k

Or

B([Q, Q′](x[2,k+k′]), x1) = B([Q, Q′](x[1,k+k′−1]), xk+k′)

This means [Q, Q′] is B-quadratic, DB is a Lie subalgebra of D.

Now ΩQ (resp. ΩQ′) is a k + 1-linear (resp. k′ + 1-linear) cyclic form, and

{ΩQ, ΩQ′}(x1, . . . , xk+k′) = Xi

ιeiΩQ ⊗ ιe′

ΩQ′!Cycl

(x1, . . . , xk+k′)

B(Q(xσ−1(1), . . . , xσ−1(k)), ei)B(Q′(xσ−1(k+1), . . . , xσ−1(k+k′)), e′
i)

= Xσ∈CyclXi
= Xσ∈Cycl

B(Q(xσ−1([1,k])), Q′(xσ−1([k+1,k+k′]))).

Consider a term in this sum, such that k + k′ belongs to σ−1([1, k]). This term is:

B(Q(x[r+k′+1,k+k′], x[1,r]), Q′(x[r+1,r+k′])) = B(Q(x[1,r], Q′(x[r+1,r+k′]), x[r+k′+1,k+k′−1]), xk+k′).
The sum of all these terms is just B((Q ◦ Q′)(x[1,k+k′−1], xk+k′)).

Similarly, if k + k′ is in σ−1([k + 1, k + k′]), we get:

B(Q(x[r+1,r+k′]), Q′(x[r+k+1,k+k′], x[1,r])) = −B(Q′(x[1,r], Q(x[r+1,r+k]), x[r+k+1,k+k′−1]), xk+k′),
and the corresponding sum is −B((Q′ ◦ Q)(x[1,k+k′−1], xk+k′)).

This proves:

and the proposition, since Q 7→ ΩQ is bijective.

{ΩQ, ΩQ′} = Ω[Q,Q′],

Let us now study in a more detailled way diﬀerent cases, when Q corresponds to
an associative, or a commutative or a Lie, or a pre-Lie structure, or to an up to
homotopy such structure.

4. Associative Pinczon algebras

4.1. Associative quadratic algebras.

Suppose now q is a degree 0 associative product, and b is invariant, then the
associated coderivation Q of ∆, with degree 1 is the Bar resolution of the associative
algebra (V, q). The associativity of q is equivalent to the relation [Q, Q] = 0.

More generally, a structure of A∞ algebra (or associative algebra up to homotopy)
on the space V is a degree 1 coderivation Q of ∆ on ⊗+V [1], such that [Q, Q] = 0.
With this last relation, the Pinczon coboundary dP : Λ 7→ {ΩQ, Λ} is a degree 1
diﬀerential on the (graded) Lie algebra C(V ). The corresponding cohomology is the
Pinczon cohomology of cyclic forms. Write also ΩdP Q = dP ΩQ.

Deﬁnition 4.1. An associative Pinczon algebra (C(V ), { , }, Ω) is a Pinczon bracket
{ , } on C(V ), and a degree 3 form Ω ∈ C(V ), such that {Ω, Ω} = 0.

If Ω is trilinear, then an associative Pinczon algebra is simply a quadratic associa-
tive algebra (V, b, q), where b is the symmetric non degenerated form coming from
the Pinczon bracket, and q the bilinear mapping associated to Q such that Ω = ΩQ.

Proposition 4.2. Let (C(V ), { , }, Ω) be an associative Pinczon algebra. Write

Ω = ΩQ, Q = Pk Qk, with Qk : ⊗kV [1] → V [1]. Then Q is a structure of A∞

algebra on V , and each Qk is B-quadratic for the bilinear form B coming from the
bracket.

Conversely, if (V, b) is a vector space with a non degenerated symmetric bilinear
form, any B-quadratic structure Q of A∞ algebra on V deﬁnes an unique structure
of associative Pinczon algebra on V .

4.2. Bimodules and Hochschild cohomology.

Suppose (V, q) is an associative algebra and M a bi-module. Then the Hochschild
cohomology with value in M is a part of the Pinczon cohomology of a natural Pinczon
algebra.

Consider ﬁrst the semidirect product W = V ⋊ M, that is the vector space V × M,
equipped with the associative product qW ((x, a), (y, b)) = (q(x, y), (x · b + a · y)). The
dual W ⋆ = V ⋆ × M ⋆ is now a (W, qW )-bimodule, with:

(cid:0)(x, a) · f(cid:1)(z, c) = f ((z, c)(x, a)),

(cid:0)f · (x, a)(cid:1)(z, c) = f ((x, a)(z, c)),

or if f = (g, h) ∈ V ⋆ × M ⋆, (x, a) · (g, h) = (x · g + a · h, x · h), (g, h) · (x, a) =
(g · x + h · a, h · x).

PINCZON ALGEBRAS

9

This deﬁnes a structure of algebra on the space ˜V = W × W ⋆, namely:

˜q((x, a, g, h), (x′, a′, g′, h′)) = (xx′, xa′ + ax′, x · g′ + g · x′ + a · h′ + h · a′, x · h′ + h · x′),
and a non degenerated symmetric bilinear form ˜b,

˜b((x, a, g, h), (x′, a′, g′, h′)) = g(x′) + h(a′) + g′(x) + h′(a).

Now ( ˜V , ˜b, ˜q) is a quadratic associative algebra, it is the double semi-direct product
of (V, q) by the bimodule M. As usual, ˜Q is associated to ˜q, after a shifting of degree.

Let now c : V k → M, k-linear, with degree |c| = 2 − k, and identify C with

˜C : ˜V [1]k → ˜V [1], by putting:

˜C((x1, a1, g1, h1), . . . , (xk, ak, gk, hk)) = (0, C(x1, . . . , xk),Xj

Cj(x1, . . . , hj, . . . , xk), 0),

where Cj(x1, . . . , hj, . . . , xk) = hj(C(xj+1, . . . , xk, ·, x1, . . . , xj−1)) ∈ V ⋆. A direct
computation shows that ˜C is ˜B-quadratic. A direct computation gives:

dP ˜Q = [ ˜Q, ˜C] = ^[Q, C] = ^(dHc)[1],

where dH is the Hochschild coboundary operator on the bimodule M.

Proposition 4.3.

Let (V, q) be an associative algebra, and c 7→ Ω ˜C the map associating to any mul-
tilinear mapping c from V k into M, with degree 2 − k, the cyclic form Ω ˜C. Then
this map is a complex morphism between the Hochschild cohomology for the (V, q)
bimodule M and the Pinczon cohomology of cyclic forms C( ˜V ) on ˜V .

5. Commutative Pinczon algebras

5.1. Commutative quadratic algebras.

Consider a quadratic associative algebra (V, b, q), but suppose now q is commuta-
tive. Consider, as above the corresponding coderivation Q. It is now anticommuta-
tive, with degree 1, and seen as a map ⊗2V [1] → V [1], where ⊗2V [1] is the quotient
of ⊗2V [1] by the 1, 1 shuﬄe product sh1,1(x1, x2) = x1 ⊗ x2 + x2 ⊗ x1.

Recall that a p, q shuﬄe σ is a permutation σ ∈ Sp+q such that σ(1) < . . . < σ(p)
and σ(p + 1) < . . . < σ(p + q). Denote Sh(p, q) the set of all such shuﬄes. Then the
p, q shuﬄe product on ⊗+V [1] is

shp,q(x[1,p], x[p+1,p+q]) = Xσ∈Sh(p,q)

xσ−1(1) ⊗ . . . ⊗ xσ−1(p+q).

Denote ⊗n(V [1]) the quotient of ⊗nV [1] by the sum of all the image of the maps
shp,n−p (0 < p < n), and x[1,n] = x1⊗ . . . ⊗xn the class of x1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ xn, where the xi

10

D. ARNAL, W. BAKBRAHEM, AND M. SELMI

belong to V [1]. Finally, ⊗+(V [1]) is the sum of all ⊗n(V [1]) (n > 0).

On ⊗+V [1], there is a Lie cobracket δ, deﬁned by

δ(x[1,n]) =

n−1

Xj=1

x[1,j]O x[j+1,n] − x[j+1,n]O x[1,j].

In fact δ is well deﬁned on the quotient and any coderivation Q of δ is characterized

by its Taylor expansion Q =Pk Qk where each Qk is a linear map from ⊗kV [1] into

V [1] (see for instance [AAC1, BGHHW]).

Deﬁnition 5.1. A structure of C∞ algebra, or up to homotopy commutative algebra,
on V is a degree 1 coderivation Q of δ, on ⊗+V [1], such that [Q, Q] = 0.

Associated to the notion of vanishing on shuﬄe products mapping Q, there is a

notion of vanishing on shuﬄe product forms Ω.

Deﬁnition 5.2. A (k + 1)-linear cyclic form Ω on the vector space V [1] is vanishing
on shuﬄe product if, for any y, (x1, . . . , xk) 7→ Ω(x1, . . . , xk, y) is vanishing on shuﬄe
product. Denote Cvsp(V ) the space of cyclic, vanishing on shuﬄe product multilinear
forms on V [1].

Proposition 5.3. Suppose { , } is a Pinczon bracket on the space C(V ) of cyclic
multilinear forms on V [1]. Then Cvsp(V ) is a Lie subalgebra of (C(V ), { , }).

Proof. In fact, the Pinczon bracket deﬁnes a non degenerate form b on V , thus B on
V [1], any form Ω can be written as Ω = ΩQ, with

ΩQ(x1, . . . , xk+1) = B(Q(x1, . . . , xk), xk+1).

Therefore Ω is in Cvsp(V ) if and only if Q is vanishing on shuﬄe products. Now,
in [AAC2] it is shown that if Q, Q′ are vanishing on shuﬄe products, then [Q, Q′] is
also vanishing on shuﬄe products. This proves the proposition.

(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 5.4. A commutative Pinczon algebra (C(V ), { , }, Ω) is a Pinczon bracket
{ , } on C(V ), and a degree 3 form Ω ∈ Cvsp(V ), such that {Ω, Ω} = 0.

As for associative algebra, a commutative Pinczon algebra with Ω trilinear is sim-

ply a quadratic commutative algebra (V, q, b).

Proposition 5.5. Let (C(V ), { , }, Ω) be an commutative Pinczon algebra. Write

Ω = ΩQ, Q =Pk Qk, with Qk : ⊗kV [1] → V [1]. Then Q is a structure of C∞ algebra

on V , and each Qk is B-quadratic for the bilinear form B coming from the bracket.
Conversely, if (V, b) is a vector space with a non degenerated symmetric bilinear
form, any B-quadratic structure Q of C∞ algebra on V deﬁnes an unique structure
of commutative Pinczon algebra on V .

5.2. (Bi)modules and Harrison cohomology.

Any module M on a commutative algebra (V, q) is a bimodule where right and
left action are coinciding. Let now (V, q) be a commutative algebra, and M a
(V, q)-module. Repeat the preceding construction of the quadratic associative al-
gebra ( ˜V , ˜b, ˜q). Now ( ˜V , ˜b, ˜q) is commutative.

As above, look now for a k-linear mapping c from V k into M, with degree 2−k and
vanishing on shuﬄe products, denote ˜C the corresponding map ˜V k → ˜V , with degree
1, We saw that dP ˜C = [ ˜Q, ˜C] = ^[Q, C] = ^dHc[1]. If we restrict this to vansihing on
shuﬄe products map c, this is the Harrison coboundary ^dHac[1].

Proposition 5.6. Let (V, q) be a commutative algebra, and c 7→ Ω ˜C the map asso-
ciating to any multilinear mapping c from V k into M, with degree 2 − k, the cyclic
form Ω ˜C. Then this map is a complex morphism between the Harrison cohomology
for the (V, q) bimodule M and the Pinczon cohomology of cyclic forms C( ˜V ) on ˜V .

6. Pinczon Lie algebras

6.1. Quadratic Lie algebras.

Suppose now (V, q) is a (graded) Lie algebra. Then the corresponding Bar resolu-
tion consists in replacing the space ⊗+V [1] of tensors by the subspace S+(V [1]) of
xσ(1) ⊗

symmetric tensors, spanned by the symmetric products x1 · . . . · xk =Pσ∈Sk

. . . ⊗ xσ(k). Then, the natural comultiplication ∆ on S+(V [1]) is:

∆(x1 · . . . · xk) = XI⊔J=[1,k]

0<#I<k

x·IO x·J ,

where, if I = {i1 < . . . < ir}, x·I means xi1 · . . . · xir .

As above, any coderivation Q of the comultiplication ∆ is characterized by its
Taylor coeﬃcients Qk : Sk(V [1]) → V [1]. The bracket of two such coderivations Q,

12

D. ARNAL, W. BAKBRAHEM, AND M. SELMI

Q′ becomes:

[Q, Q′](x1 · . . . · xk+k′−1) = XI⊔J=[1,k+k′−1]

Q(Q′(x·J ) · x·I) − XI⊔J=[1,k+k′−1]

#I=k

#J=k′

Q′(Q(x·I) · x·J ),

Now to the Lie bracket q on V is associated a map Q : S2(V [1]) → V [1], thus a
degree 1 coderivation, still denoted Q, of ∆ and the Jacobi identity for q is equivalent
to the relation [Q, Q] = 0. The corresponding cohomology is the Chevalley cohomol-
ogy.

For any k, consider Sk(V [1]) as a subspace of ⊗kV [1], with a projection Sym :

⊗kV [1] → Sk(V [1]):

Sym(x1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ xk) = x1 · . . . · xk.

Denote L(⊗kV [1], V [1]) the of linear maps Q : ⊗kV [1] → V [1]. By restriction to
Sk(V [1]), Q deﬁnes a symmetric map, denote it QSym. Then QSym = Q ◦ Sym, and
the space L(Sk(V [1]), V [1]) of symmetric maps is a quotient of L(⊗kV [1], V [1]).

Similarly, the restriction of Ω ∈ Ck+1 is a symmetric form, denote it ΩSym: ΩSym =
Ω ◦ Sym. as above, the space C|S(V ) of the restrictions of cyclic multilinear forms to
S+(V [1]) is a quotient of C(V ).

Suppose there is a Pinczon bracket { , } on C(V ), then any Ω can be written
Ω = ΩQ, with Q k-linear and B-quadratic. But, any element σ in Sk+1 can be
written in an unique way as a product τ ◦ ρ where τ is in Sk, viewed as a subgroup
of Sk+1 and ρ in Cycl. Therefore, with our notation,

ΩSym = (ΩQ)Sym = (ΩQSym)Cycl = (k + 1)ΩQSym.

Proposition 6.1. The bracket deﬁned on L(⊗+V [1], V [1]) by the commutator of
coderivations in (⊗+V [1], ∆), induces a well deﬁned bracket on L(S+(V [1]), V [1]),
this bracket is the above commutator of coderivations in (S+(V [1]), ∆):

Any Pinczon braket { , } on C(V ) induces a well deﬁned bracket on the quotient

(cid:2)QSym, (Q′)Sym(cid:3) = [Q, Q′]Sym.

C|S(V ), this bracket denoted { , }| is:

(cid:8)ΩSym, (Ω′)Sym(cid:9) | = ({Ω, Ω′})Sym =

k + k′

(k + 1)!(k′ + 1)!Xi

ιei(cid:0)ΩSym(cid:1) · ιe′

i(cid:0)(Ω′)Sym(cid:1) .

Proof. The ﬁrst assertion is a simple computation:

(Q ◦ Q′)(x[1,k+k′−1]) =

k−1

Xr=1

Q(x[1,r−1] ⊗ Q′(x[r,r+k′−1]) ⊗ x[r+k′,k+k′−1]).

PINCZON ALGEBRAS

13

Then,

(Q◦Q′)Sym(x·[1,k+k′−1]) = Xr

σ∈Sk+k′ −1

Q(xσ−1([1,r−1]), Q′(xσ−1([r,r+k′−1])), xσ−1([r+k′,k+k′−1]))

Fix r and σ, put J = σ−1([r, r + k′ − 1]) = {j1 < . . . < jk′}, and jτ −1(t) =
σ−1(r + t − 1) (1 ≤ t ≤ k′). This deﬁne σ ∈ Sk′. Similarly, put I = [1, k + k′ − 1] \ J,
{0} ∪ I = {i1 < . . . < ik} and deﬁne ρ ∈ Sk by:
iρ−1(t) = σ−1(t)
The correspondence (r, σ) 7→ (r, τ, ρ) is one-to-one and, suming up, we get:

iρ−1(t) = σ−1(t − 1)

(r + 1 ≤ t ≤ k).

(1 ≤ t ≤ r − 1),

iρ−1(r) = 0,

(Q ◦ Q′)Sym(x·[1,k+k′−1]) = XI⊔J=[1,k+k′−1]

#J=k′

QSym((Q′)Sym(x·J) · x·I).

The commutator of coderivation of (S+(V [1]), ∆) is the quotient bracket:

Let now { , } be a Pinczon bracket on the space C(V ). Thus any cyclic form Ω is

[Q, Q′]Sym =(cid:2)QSym, (Q′)Sym(cid:3) .

written as ΩQ. Then:
{Ω, Ω′}Sym = {ΩQ, ΩQ′}Sym = ΩSym

[Q,Q′] = (k + k′)Ω[Q,Q′]Sym = (k + k′)Ω[QSym,(Q′)Sym].

The last bracket is the commutator of coderivations in S+(V [1]), thus

{Ω, Ω′}Sym(x·[1,k+k′]) = (k + k′) XI⊔J=[1,k+k′]

#J=k′

B(QSym(x·I), (Q′)Sym(x·J )).

On the other hand,

Therefore

Xi

ιei(cid:16)ΩSym
ιei(cid:16)ΩSym

Q (cid:17) (x·[1,k]) = (k + 1)B(QSym(x·[1,k]), ei) = (k + 1) (ιeiΩ)Sym (x·[1,k]).
Q (cid:17) · ιe′

Q′ (cid:17)(cid:17)Sym

Q (cid:17) ⊗ ιe′

i(cid:16)ΩSym

i(cid:16)ΩSym

Q′ (cid:17) (x·[1,k+k′]) =Xi (cid:16)ιei(cid:16)ΩSym
= (k + 1)!(k′ + 1)! XI⊔J=[1,k+k′]

#J=k′

(x·[1,k+k′])

B(QSym(x·I), (Q′)Sym(x·J ))

This achieves the proof.

(cid:3)

Explicitely, if the forms Ω and Ω′ are symmetric, ΩSym = (k +1)!Ω and the Pinczon

bracket on the quotient becomes the bracket deﬁned in [PU, DPU]:

{Ω, Ω′}| = (k + k′)Xi

6.2. Quadratic L∞ algebras.

As above,

Deﬁnition 6.2. A Pinczon Lie algebra (C(V ), { , }, Ω) is a Pinczon bracket { , }
on C(V ), and a degree 3 symmetric form Ω ∈ C(V )Sym, such that {Ω, Ω} = 0.

Since a structure of L∞ algebra (or Lie algebra up to homotopy) on V is a degree
1 coderivation Q of (S+(V [1]), ∆), such that the commutator [Q, Q] vanishes. With
the preceding computations, a Pinczon Lie algebra is in fact a quadratic L∞ algebra.

Proposition 6.3. Let (C(V ), { , }, Ω) be a Pinczon Lie algebra. Write Ω = ΩQ,

Q =Pk Qk, with Qk : Sk(V [1]) → V [1]. Then Q is a structure of L∞ algebra on V ,

and each Qk is B-quadratic for the bilinear form B coming from the bracket.

Conversely, if (V, b) is a vector space with a non degenerated symmetric bilinear
form, any B-quadratic structure Q of L∞ algebra on V deﬁnes an unique structure
of commutative Pinczon algebra on V .

6.3. Modules and Chevalley cohomology.

Let (V, q) be a Lie algebra, and M a (V, q)-module. To reﬁnd the corresponding
Chevalley coboundary operator dCh, build, as above, the double semidirect product
of V by M.

First, consider the semidirect product W = V ⋊M, that is the vector space V ⊕M,
equipped with the Lie bracket qW ((x, a), (y, b)) = ([x, y], x · b − y · a); its dual W ⋆ is
also a (W, qW )-module.

Then ˜V = W × V × W ⋆ is a quadratic Lie algebra for the bracket

˜q((x, a, g, h), (x′, a′, g′, h′)) = ([x, x′], x·a′ −x′ ·a, x·g′ −x′ ·g +a·h′ −a′ ·h, x·h′ −x′ ·h),
and the non degenerated symmetric bilinear form ˜b

˜b((x, a, g, h), (x′, a′, g′, h′)) = g(x′) + h(a′) + g′(x) + h′(a).

A direct computation (see [BB, MR]) shows that ( ˜V , ˜b, ˜q) is a quadratic Lie algebra,
the double semidirect product of (V, q) by its module M.

Look now for a skew-symmetric k-linear mapping c from V k into M, with degree

|c| = 2 − k. Associate to it the mapping:

k

˜C((x1, a1, g1, h1), . . . , (xk, ak, fk, gk)) = (0, C(x1, . . . , xk),

Cj(x1, . . . , hj, . . . , xk), 0).

Clearly, ˜C is totaly symmetric from ˜V [1]k into ˜V [1]. More precisely ]C Sym = ˜C Sym.

Xj=1

PINCZON ALGEBRAS

15

Then,

[ ˜Q, ˜C]Sym = ^[Q, C]

Sym

= ^[Q, C]Sym = ^dChc[1].

Now, if dP is the Pinczon coboundary operator, deﬁned by:

this can be written dP ˜C = (2 + k) ^dChc[1].

{Ω ˜Q, Ω ˜C}| = ΩdP ˜C,

Proposition 6.4. Let (V, q) be a Lie algebra, and c 7→ Ω ˜C the map associating to
any multilinear skewsymmetric mapping c from V k into M, with degree 2 − k, the
symmetric form Ω ˜C. Then this map is a complex morphism between the Chevalley
cohomology for the (V, q) module M and the Pinczon cohomology of symmetric forms
C( ˜V )|S on ˜V .

7. Pinczon pre-Lie algebras

7.1. Quadratic pre-Lie algebras.

A left pre-Lie algebra (V, q) is a (graded) vector space with a product q such that:

q(x, q(y, z)) − q(q(x, y), z) = q(y, q(x, z)) − q(q(y, x), z).

Then the bracket [x, y] = q(x, y)−q(y, x) is a Lie bracket. Remark that any associative
algebra (V, q) is a pre-Lie algebra.

A vector space M is a left (V, q)-module for the linear map x ⊗ a 7→ x · a, if

q(x, y) · a − x · (y · a) = q(y, x) · a − y · (x · a)

(a ∈ M, x ∈ V ).

A left module is a bi-module, if there is a linear map a ⊗ x 7→ a ∗ x such that:

(a ∗ x) ∗ y − a ∗ q(x, y) = (x · a) ∗ y − x · (a ∗ y)

(a ∈ M, x, y ∈ V ).

Then a direct computation proves

Lemma 7.1. Let (V, q) a left pre-Lie algebra, then

1. The dual V ⋆ of V is a left (V, q)-module, for: (x · f )(y) = −f (q(x, y)).
2. Let M be a (V, q) bi-module then W = V ⋊ M = (V ⊕ M, qW ), where:

qW (x + a, y + b) = q(x, y) + x · b + a ∗ y

is a left pre-Lie algebra, the semi-direct product of V by M.

16

D. ARNAL, W. BAKBRAHEM, AND M. SELMI

Chapoton and Livernet deﬁne in [CL] the notion of pre-L∞-algebra.

If V is a
graded vector space, we consider the space S(V [1]) ⊗ V ([1]), generated by the tensors

x[1,k] ⊗ y = x1 · . . . · xk ⊗ y.

Put P k = Sk(V [1]) ⊗ V ([1]), and P =Pk≥0 P k. On P , the coproduct ∆ is deﬁned

by ∆(1 ⊗ y) = 0 and:

∆(x[1,k] ⊗ y) = X1≤j≤k

I⊔J=[1,k]\{j}

(xI ⊗ xj)O(xJ ⊗ y).

A linear map Q : P k → P 0 extends to a coderivation, still denoted Q by:

Q(x[1,n] ⊗ y) = XI⊔J=[1,n]

#J=k

xI ⊗ Q(xJ ⊗ y) + X1≤j≤n

I⊔J=[1,n]\{j}

#J=k

xI · Q(xJ ⊗ xj) ⊗ y.

The commutator of two coderivations is a coderivation, and a map q : V ⊗ V → V
is a left pre-Lie product if and only if the structure equation [Q, Q] = 0 holds for the
corresponding map Q : P 1 → P 0. Thus:

Deﬁnition 7.2. A structure of pre-L∞ algebra on V is a degree 1 coderivation Q of
(P, ∆), such that [Q, Q] = 0.

Now, a quadratic pre-Lie algebra (V, b, q) is a pre-Lie algebra (V, q) equipped with

a symmetric, non degenerated, degree 0, bilinear form b such that

b(q(x, y), z) + b(y, q(x, z)) = 0,

or B(Q(x, y), z) = B(Q(x, z), y).

Example 7.3. Let (V, q) be a left pre-Lie algebra, consider the pre-Lie algebra,
semidirect product W = V ⋊ V ⋆, with

qW (x + f, y + g) = q(x, y) + x · g = q(x, y) − g(q(x, ·)).

It is a quadratic pre-Lie algebra if we endow W by the canonical symmetric, non
degenerated form b(x + f, y + g) = f (y) + g(x).

Generalizing, let us say that a coderivation Q = Q0 + Q1 + . . . of ∆ is B-quadratic

if, for any k,

B(Qk(x[1,k] ⊗ y1), y2) = B(Qk(x[1,k] ⊗ y2), y1).

Then a direct computation gives:

Lemma 7.4. Let Q and Q′ be two B-quadratic coderivations of ∆. Then [Q, Q′] is
B-quadratic.

PINCZON ALGEBRAS

17

A structure of quadratic pre-L∞ algebra on (V, b) is thus a B-quadratic coderiva-

tion Q of ∆ such that [Q, Q] = 0.

7.2. Pinczon bracket for pre-Lie algebras.

To a k + 1-linear coderivation Q, let us associate the form ΩQ:

ΩQ(x[1,k] ⊗ y1 · y2) = B(Q(x[1,k] ⊗ y1), y2) + B(Q(x[1,k] ⊗ y2), y1).

This form is separately symmetric in its k ﬁrst variables, and its 2 last variables.

Deﬁne thus Pk the space of such forms, and P(V ) =Pk≥0 Pk. An element of P(V )

is called a bi-symmetric form. Now it is possible to extend to P(V ) the Pinczon
bracket { , } associated to B. Indeed, a direct computation shows:

Lemma 7.5. Let g be a Lie algebra and A a commutative algebra which is a right
g-module such that, for any x ∈ g, f 7→ f · x is a derivation of A. Then the formula:

[f ⊗ x, g ⊗ y] = f g ⊗ [x, y] + (f · y)g ⊗ x − f (g · x) ⊗ y

deﬁnes a Lie bracket on A ⊗ g.

Denote S(V ) = (C(V ))Sym the symmetric algebra of V , it is a commutative algebra
for the symmetric product ·. On the other hand, by construction, C2 is a Lie algebra
for the Pinczon bracket { , }, acting on S through (Ω, α) 7→ {Ω, α}. Then the
properties of the Pinczon bracket assure that S is a (S 2, { , })-module and the action
is a derivation of S. Finally remark that P(V ) = S(V ) ⊗ C2, therefore:

Corollary 7.6. Let (V, b) be a vector space with a symmetric, non degenerated bilin-
ear form, then the space P(V ) of bi-symmetric forms on V is a Lie algebra for the
Pinczon bracket:

{Ω ⊗ α, Ω′ ⊗ α′} = Ω · {α, Ω′} ⊗ α′ + Ω′ · {Ω, α′} ⊗ α + Ω · Ω′ ⊗ {α, α′}.

This bracket is related to the commutator of B-preserving coderivations, since:

Proposition 7.7. Suppose b is a symmetric non degenrated form on V , and Q, Q′
two B-quadratic coderivations of ∆. Consider the forms ΩQ, ΩQ′ in P(V ), then

{ΩQ, ΩQ′} = 2Ω[Q,Q′].

Proof. Suppose ΩQ = β ⊗ α ∈ P k, and ΩQ′ = β′ ⊗ α′ ∈ P k′, then
β · β′ ⊗ {α, α′}(x[1,k+k′], y[1,2]) =

(cid:0)ΩQ(xI ⊗ ei · y1)ΩQ′(xJ ⊗ e′

i · y2) + ΩQ(xI ⊗ ei · y2)ΩQ′(xJ ⊗ e′

i · y1)(cid:1)

−B(Q′(xJ ⊗ Q(xI ⊗ y1)), y2) + B(Q(xI ⊗ Q′(xJ ⊗ y1)), y2)

On the other hand,

β · {α, β′} ⊗ α′(x[1,k+k′], y[1,2]) =

B(Q′(Q(xI ⊗ xj) · xJ ⊗ y1), y2).

And similarly for the last term {β, α′} · β′ ⊗ α in the Pinczon bracket. Suming up,
we get:

{ΩQ, ΩQ′}(x[1,k+k′] ⊗ y[1,2])

deg
= 2B([Q, Q′](x[1,k+k′] ⊗ y1), y2) + 2B([Q, Q′](x[1,k+k′] ⊗ y2), y1)
deg
= 2Ω[Q,Q′](x[1,k+k′] ⊗ y[1,2]).

(cid:3)

As for the other sort of algebras,

Deﬁnition 7.8. A Pinczon pre-Lie algebra (P(V ), { , }, Ω) is a Pinczon bracket
{ , } on C(V ), extended to P(V ), and a degree 3 bi-symmetric form Ω ∈ P(V ), such
that {Ω, Ω} = 0.

Since a structure of pre-L∞ algebra on V is a degree 1 coderivation Q of (P, ∆),
such that the commutator [Q, Q] vanishes. With the preceding computations, a Pinc-
zon pre-Lie algebra is in fact a quadratic pre-L∞ algebra.

Proposition 7.9. Let (P(V ), { , }, Ω) be a Pinczon pre-Lie algebra. Write Ω = ΩQ,

and each Qk is B-quadratic.

and Q = Pk Qk, with Qk : P k → P 0. Then Q is a pre-L∞ algebra structure on V ,

Conversely, if (V, b) is a vector space with a non degenerated symmetric bilinear
form, any B-quadratic structure Q of pre-L∞ algebra on V deﬁnes an unique struc-
ture of Pinczon pre-Lie algebra on V .

7.3. Pinczon and pre-Lie algebra cohomologies.

Suppose (V, q) is a left pre-Lie algebra and let Q be the coderivation of ∆ associated

to q. Since [Q, Q] = 0, d : C 7→ [Q, C] is a coboundary operator.

Now, let M be a (V, q) bi-module. Let W = V ⋊M be the semi-direct product of V
by M. Any map c : ∧kV ⊗ V → M can be naturally extended to a map, still denoted
c, from ∧kW ⊗ W to W . If C is the corresponding coderivation, the map dc, where
the coderivation corresponding to dc : ∧k+1W ⊗ W → W is [Q, C], is the extension

PINCZON ALGEBRAS

19

of a map dpLc : ∧k+1V ⊗ V → M. The operator d is the pre-Lie coboundary op-
erator. In an unpublished work, Ridha Chatbouri computed explicitely this operator:

Proposition 7.10. The cohomology of the pre-Lie algebra (V, q) is deﬁned as follows.
Let M be a (V, q) bi-module, the cohomology with value in M is given by the following
operator: If c : ∧kV ⊗V → M is a (k+1)-cochain, with degree |c|, then dc is explicitly:
(−1)|c|dpLc(x0 ∧ . . . ∧ xk ⊗ y) =

(−1)ic(x0 ∧ . . .ˆi . . . ∧ xk ⊗ xi) ∗ y −

In [Dz], A. Dzhumaldil’daev deﬁned a coboundary operator d for right pre-Lie
algebra, which is the same as the operator computed in the preceding proposition,
modulo the change of side for pre-Lie axioms. Then he used this operator to com-
pute a corresponding homology. The proof of the proposition is the inverse of the
Dzhumaldil’daev proof.

Remark 7.11. A left (V, q)-module is nothing else that a (V, [ , ])-module. However
the symmetry of a pre-Lie cochain diﬀers of the symmetry of a Lie cochain. Thus the
c (R), with q(f, g) = f g′.
cocycles are not the same. For instance we consider V = C ∞
Choose M = V and f · g = q(f, g). Then M is a left module. Put c(f, g) = f g. It is
easy to verify it is a cocycle, but it is not skewsymmetric. In fact it is the coboundary
of f 7→ b(f ), with (b(f ))(t) = tf (t).

More generally, if Q is a coderivation of ∆, which is a pre-L∞ structure, then the
operator C 7→ [Q, C] is a coboundary operator. Let us call the corresponding coho-
mology the (V, Q) cohomology. Then

Corollary 7.12. Suppose (V, b, q) is a quadratic pre-Lie algebra or, more generally,
(P(V ), { , }, Ω) a Pinczon pre-Lie algebra. Then the operator d : P(V ) → P(V )
deﬁned by dΩ = {ΩQ, Ω} is a coboundary operator and the corresponding cohomology
coincides with the (V, Q)-cohomology.

8. A natural example

Recall that the inﬁnitesimal deformations of an associative (resp. Lie, resp. pre-
Lie) algebra (V, q) are described by the corresponding second cohomology group

20

D. ARNAL, W. BAKBRAHEM, AND M. SELMI

(Hochschild, pre-Lie or Chevalley) of V (see [G, NR]). Indeed, putting qt = q + tc,
with t2 = 0, the associativity, Jacobi or pre-Lie relation are respectively equivalent to
[Q, C] = 0. Therefore, if t2 = 0, (V + tV, qt), is an associative, Lie or pre-Lie algebra
if and only if c is respectively a Hochschild, a Chevalley or a pre-Lie cocycle.

Such a deformation is trivial if there is a linear map a such that ϕt(x) = x + ta(x)
satisﬁes qt(ϕt(x), ϕt(y)) = ϕt(q(x, y)). With t2 = 0, these conditions are equivalent
to c = dHa, resp. c = dCha, c = dpLa. If the only inﬁnitesimal deformations are the
trivial ones, that is if the second Hochschild cohomology group H 2((V, q)) vanishes,
we say that the corresponding structure is inﬁnitesimally rigid.

Suppose now (V, q) is an associative algebra. Therefore it is a pre-Lie algebra for
the multiplication q, and a Lie algebra for the bracket [x, y] = q(x, y) − q(y, x). Some
of these structures can be rigid, and other can be not rigid. Let us study here the
natural associative algebra Mn(K) of n × n matrices on a characteristic zero ﬁeld
K. Denote gln(K) the corresponding Lie algebra, and (Mn, q) the pre-Lie algebra.
Remark that gln(K) is a direct product: sln(K) ⊕ Kid, where sln(K) is the space of
traceless matrices. Put f (x) = 1
ntr(x)id. Recall ﬁrst some well-known results (see
[CH] Chap IX.7, and use Hochschild-Serre sequence and Whitehead Lemmas [J]):

Proposition 8.1. Let M be a Mn(K) bi-module, then H k(Mn(K), M) = 0 for k > 0.
Especially, if M = Mn(K),

H 0(Mn(K)) = Kid, H k(Mn(K)) = 0 for k > 0.

Let M be a gln(K)-module, and k > 0, then:

H k(gln(K), M) ≃ H k(sln(K), K) ⊗ M gln(K) ⊕ H k−1(sln(K), K) ⊗(cid:0)H 1(Kid, M)(cid:1)gln(K)

Especially, if M = gln(K), and ˜f is the class of the projection f ,

.

H 0(gln(K)) = Kid,

H 1(gln(K)) = K ˜f ,

H 2(gln(K)) = 0.

Especially, Mn(K) and gln(K) are rigid. However the pre-Lie algebra V is not

inﬁnitesimally rigid:

Lemma 8.2. The second cohomology group H 2(Mn, q) of the pre-Lie algebra (Mn, q)
is not vanishing.

Proof. Following [Dz], for any matrix a, consider ca(x, y) = 1

n tr(x)[y, a]. Then:

dHca(x, y, z) =

1
n

(tr(y)x − tr(xy)id + tr(x)y)[z, a] = (dHf )(x, y)[z, a].

Then dpLca(x, y, z) = dHca(x, y, z)−dHca(y, x, z) = 0. But remark that Z 2(Mn(K)) =
B2(Mn(K)) = B2(Mn, q). Thus, if a is not a scalar matrix, there is z such that

[z, a] 6= 0, and dHca(e12, e21, z) = −[z, a] 6= 0, ca is not in B2(Mn, q).

Let (x, y) 7→ q(x, y) any algebraic structure on a space V and ck : V ⊗ V → V

(k ≥ 1). If for any t, qt = q +Pk>0 tkck endows V ⊗ K[[t]] with the same sort of
structure, we say that qt is a formal deformation of q. If there is ϕt = id +Pk>0 tkbk,

such that qt(ϕt(x), ϕt(y)) = ϕt(q(x, y)), we say that qt is trivial. If there is a non
trivial deformation qt, we say that (V, q) is not rigid.
If moreover ck = 0 for any
k > 1, and c1 /∈ B2(V, q), we say that qt = q + tc1 is a true deformation at order 1 of
(V, q).

Using induction on k, it is easy to prove that an inﬁnetisimally rigid structure is
rigid. Of course the existence of a true deformation at order 1 implies that (V, q) is
not rigid.

Corollary 8.3. The algebras Mn(K), gln(K) are rigid. The pre-Lie algebra (Mn, q)
admits true deformations at order 1.

Proof. The ﬁrst points are the previous results. Consider now the pre-Lie algebra
(Mn, q). A direct computation shows that qt = q + tca is a true deformation at order
1 of (V, q) (see also [Dz]).

(cid:3)

Suppose now K = C. Then x 7→ tr(x2), and x 7→ (tr(x))2 generate the space of
gln(C)-invariant degree 2 polynomial functions on gln(C) (see [W]). Any symmetric
invariant bilinear form b on gln(C) can be written:

b(x, y) = α tr(xy) + β tr(x)tr(y) = αtr(x(y − f (y))) + (

1
n

α + β)tr(x)tr(y).

Thus, b is non degenerate, if and only if α(α + nβ) 6= 0.

Observe now that (x, y) 7→ tr(xy) is Mn(C)-invariant, but (x, y) 7→ tr(x)tr(y) is not
Mn(C)-invariant. Thus the non degenerated bilinear form (x, y) 7→ tr(xy) generates
the cone of Mn(C)-invariant symmetric bilinear forms.

Similarly, if b is (Mn, q)-invariant, it is gln(C)-invariant, thus b(x, y) = αtr(xy) +

βtr(x)tr(y), and the invariance relation reads:

αtr(xyz + yxz) + β(tr(xy)tr(z) + tr(y)tr(xz)) = 0.

Choosing for instance x = y = z = e11, we get 2(α+β) = 0, then x = y = z = id gives
2n(α + nβ) = 0, the unique (Mn, q)-invariant symmetric bilinear form is identically
zero. Summarizing,

Lemma 8.4.

1. The associative algebra Mn(C) is a quadratic algebra for the

1-dimensional cone of symmetric bilinear forms αtr(xy),

2. The Lie agebra gln(C) is a quadratic Lie algebra for the 2-dimensional cone

of symmetric bilinear forms αtr(xy) + βtr(x)tr(y) (α(α + nβ) 6= 0),

3. The pre-Lie algebra (Mn, q) is not a quadratic pre-Lie algebra.

Recall that in Example 7.3, we saw that the space Mn(C) ⊕ Mn(C) is a quadratic

pre-lie algebra for the product and the bilinear form:

qW (x1 + x2, y1 + y2) = x1y1 − y2x1,

b(x1 + x2, y1 + y2) = tr(x2y1 + x1y2).
