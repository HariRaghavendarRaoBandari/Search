We investigate the evolution of hydromagnetic perturbations in a small section of accre-
tion disks. It is known that molecular viscosity is negligible in accretion disks. Hence, it
has been argued that Magnetorotational Instability (MRI) is responsible for transporting
matter in the presence of weak magnetic ﬁeld. However, there are some shortcomings,
which question eﬀectiveness of MRI. Now the question arises, whether other hydromag-
netic eﬀects, e.g. transient growth (TG), can play an important role to bring nonlinearity
in the system, even at weak magnetic ﬁelds. Otherwise, whether MRI or TG, which is
primarily responsible to reveal nonlinearity to make the ﬂow turbulent? Our results
prove explicitly that the ﬂows with high Reynolds number (Re), which is the case of
realistic astrophysical accretion disks, exhibit nonlinearity by best TG of perturbation
modes faster than that by best modes producing MRI. For a ﬁxed wavevector, MRI
dominates over transient eﬀects, only at low Re, lower than its value expected to be in
astrophysical accretion disks, and low magnetic ﬁelds. This seriously questions (overall)
persuasiveness of MRI in astrophysical accretion disks.

1. Introduction

Accretion disks are found in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), around a compact stellar
object in binary systems, around newly formed stars etc. 1,2. However, the working
principle of accretion disks still remains enigmatic to us. Due to its inadequacy of
molecular viscosity, turbulent viscosity has been proposed to explain the transport
of matter towards the central object. This idea is particularly attractive because
of its high Re(& 1014) 3. However, the Keplerian disks, which are relevant to many
astrophysical applications, are remarkably Rayleigh stable. Therefore, linear per-
turbation cannot induce the onset of turbulence and, consequently, cannot provide
enough turbulent viscosity to transport matter inwards.

With the application of Magnetorotational Instability (MRI) 4,5 to Keplerian
disks, Balbus & Hawley 6 showed that initial seed, weak magnetic ﬁeld can lead to
the velocity and magnetic ﬁeld perturbations growing exponentially and reveal the
onset of turbulence. However, for ﬂows having strong magnetic ﬁelds, where the
magnetic ﬁeld is tightly coupled with the ﬂow, MRI is not expected to work. Hence,
it is very clear that the MRI is bounded in a small regime of parameter values when
the ﬁeld is weak.

It has been argued by several works that transient growth (TG) can reveal non-
7–13. Such sub-critical tran-

linearity and transition to turbulence at sub-critical Re

sition to turbulence was invoked to explain colder purely hydrodynamic accretion
ﬂows, e.g.
in quiescent cataclysmic variables, in proto-planetary and star-forming
disks, the outer region of disks in active galactic nuclei. Note that while hotter
ﬂows are expected to be ionized enough to produce weak magnetic ﬁelds therein
and subsequent MRI, colder ﬂows may remain to be practically neutral in charge
and hence any instability and turbulence therein must be hydrodynamic. However,
in the absence of magnetic eﬀects, the Coriolis force does not allow any signiﬁcant
7, while in pure two
TG in accretion disks in three dimensions, independent of Re
dimensions TG could be large at large Re. However, a pure two-dimensional ﬂow is
a very idealistic case. Nevertheless, in the presence of magnetic ﬁeld, even in three
dimensions, TG could be very large (Coriolis eﬀects could not suppress the growth).
Hence, in a real three-dimensional ﬂow, it is very important to explore magnetic
TG.

In the present paper, we explore the relative strengths of MRI and TG in mag-
netized accretion ﬂows, in order to explain the generic origin of nonlinearity and
plausible turbulence therein. By TG we precisely mean the short-time scale growth
due to shearing perturbation waves, producing a peak followed by a dip. By MRI
we mean the exponential growth by static perturbation waves. While TG may re-
veal nonlinearity in the system, depending on Re, amplitude of initial perturbation
and its wavevector and background rotational proﬁle of the ﬂow, question is, can
its growth rate be fast enough to compete with that of MRI? On the other hand,
is there any limitation of MRI, apart from the fact that MRI does not work at
strong magnetic ﬁelds? Note that some limitations of MRI were already discussed
by previous authors 12,14–17, which then question the origin of viscosity in accretion
disks.

We show below that the three-dimensional TG dominates over the growth due
to MRI modes at large Re, bringing nonlinearity in the ﬂows. By comparing modes
corresponding to static (original MRI) and shearing (TG) waves, the growth esti-
mates from static MRI waves have already been argued to be misleading 7,8. We will
show below that in a shorter time-scale, TG reveals nonlinearity into the system.

We furthurmore explicitly calculate the magnetic ﬁeld strength above which
MRI not working. We notice that above a threshold Re, only TG is suﬃcient to
make the system nonlinear at low magnetic ﬁeld and there is no growth at high
magnetic ﬁelds. The working regime of MRI is rather much narrower than it is
generally believed. As TG was argued to be plausible source of nonlinearity in cold
disks and the growth due to MRI is subdominant compared to TG at high Re in hot
disks, TG could be argued to be the source of nonlinearity and plausible turbulence
and subsequent viscosity, in any accretion disk.

Within a local shearing box, in Lagrangian coordinate, the perturbed and linearized

(for magnetic ﬁeld) can be written as

where v, B, Ω, ρ, cs and Re are the background velocity, magnetic ﬁeld vectors,
angular velocity, density, sound speed and Reynolds number respectively and the
quantities with δ such as δv, δB etc. are the respective perturbed quantities. q is
the tensor related to the background shearing velocity depending on the rotation
parameter q 8. Here we take the background shearing velocity as v = (0, −qΩx, 0),
where x is the x-component of the Cartesian position vector of a ﬂuid element inside
the shearing box.

We now work with the incompressible approximation, i.e. δρ → 0 and c2

s → ∞,

where k and kL are the wavevectors in the Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates

3. Total Energy Growth and Nonlinearity of Perturbations for

Diﬀerent Parameter Values

The best possible mode for MRI giving rise to the nonlinearity in the system corre-
sponds to the condition kzvAz/Ω = 1, when v2
z /4πρ, is the Alfv´en velocity 6.
The growth rate for this fastest exponentially growing mode is 3Ω/4 = 3/4q (since
in dimensionless unit Ω = 1/q) 6,7,18. Note that an approximate emergence of non-
linearity is deﬁned through the measurement of the quantity “Linearity”as deﬁned

Az = B2

in eq. (6). When Linearity = 1, the system will start becoming nonlinear which will
plausibly lead to turbulence. For a Keplerian disk (q = 3/2), the best MRI mode
brings in the nonlinearity at the timescales ∼ 14 and 23 rotation times respectively
for IPAs = 10−3 and 10−5. However Fig. 1a shows that there are modes which
reveal nonlinearity via TG following eqn. (6) at around 3 and 13 rotational times
for IPAs 10−3 and 10−5 respectively or even less (Fig. 1b), which shows faster
growth rates than MRI. In Fig. 1c we show the total energy growth of perturbation
for diﬀerent strengths of magnetic ﬁelds. Thick and long dashed lines correspond
to relatively stronger magnetic ﬁelds for which there is eventually no energy growth
and the system remains linear and stable. Dotted and dot-dashed lines correspond
to weaker magnetic ﬁelds for which the total energy starts growing and makes the
system nonlinear and plausibly unstable. Also it is seen that for a given shearing
mode, in case of weak magnetic ﬁelds, nonlinearity comes through MRI for low Re,
and via TG for high Re, which are the cases for astrophysical accretion disks.

4. Calculation of the Threshold Value of Magnetic Field Strength

supporting instability

Let us estimate the maximum |B| in Gauss supporting nonlinearity, as shown by
the solid curve in Fig. 1d. We set the shearing box at 100Rg away from a 10M⊙
black hole. Then we obtain the values of density (ρ100Rg ) at that location to be
∼ 10−4 gm/cc 2. The background Keplerian velocity at that position, for the size of
the shearing box, 0.1Rg, which is consistent with that obtained for the TG active

zone 19, can be obtained as qΩL = qpGM/R3L ∼ 106 cm/sec. We now consider

Re = 1012 and, hence, from the solid line of Fig. 1d the corresponding maximum
(dimensionless) magnetic ﬁeld supporting nonlinearity is given by B2/ρ = 10−5.

Therefore, corresponding actual value of magnetic ﬁeld is p10−5ρ100Rg (qΩL)2 ∼ 30

Gauss. This means, the ﬂow with Re = 1012 and |B| > 30 Gauss, the energy growth
of perturbation will decay over time, but for |B| 6 30 Gauss, TG will be suﬃcient
enough to bring nonlinearity in the system, however, still not requiring any growth
due to MRI. From Fig. 1d, it is clear that MRI is only important whenever Re < 109,
whereas for Re > 109, which is the favorable zone of Re for accretion disks, magnetic
TG is important than MRI.

5. Conclusions

Here we have shown that, in accretion disks, there are TG modes, which bring
nonlinearity faster than the best possible MRI mode. We have computed the mag-
netic ﬁeld strengths for diﬀerent Res above which the system will be stable under
linear perturbation. We have also calculated, for a given shearing mode, an upper
bound of Re above which either the system is stable under linear perturbation (for
high magnetic ﬁeld strength) or reaches nonlinear regime (for low magnetic ﬁeld)
through magnetic TG (Fig. 1d). Since astrophysical accretion ﬂows have high Re

cases IPA = 10−3 and 10−5 respectively.

(& 1014) 3, it becomes nonlinear plausibly by magnetic TG. Hence, MRI is not the
sole mechanism to make accretion disk unstable, there is a large area where TG
rules, and explanation of accretion solely via MRI is misleading.
