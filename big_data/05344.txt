We use holography for the ab-initio determination of the non-equilibrium behavior of matter
in a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) Universe. We focus on matter without scale
invariance and develop an expansion for the corresponding entropy production in terms of the
derivatives of the cosmological scale factor. We show that the resulting series is asymptotic and we
discuss its resurgent properties. Finally, we compute the resummed entropy production rate in de
Sitter Universe at late times and show that the leading order approximation given by bulk viscosity
eﬀects can strongly overestimate/underestimate the rate depending on the microscopic parameters.

Introduction.— The standard model of cosmology [1]
is based upon the (spatially) maximally symmetric
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) line el-
ement with zero spatial curvature

ds2 = gµνdxµdxν = −dt2 + a2(t) dx2,

(1)

where the cosmological scale factor a(t) is governed by
Einstein’s equations coupled to matter

Rµν − 1
2

Rgµν = 8πG Tµν.

(2)

Under these symmetry assumptions, the matter stress
tensor is diagonal in the coordinates (1) and it reads
Tµν = diag{, P, P, P}, where  is the energy density of
the system and P is the pressure. To close the equa-
tions of motion for the scale factor, one necessarily needs
an equation relating the energy density and the pres-
sure. Typically, one assumes an equilibrium relation:
P = P (). An immediate consequence of this choice is
that the expansion of the Universe is an adiabatic (re-
versible) process — there is no entropy production in the
standard Big Bang cosmology.

In this Letter we explore what it takes to go beyond
this idealization. In the FLRW Universe the matter ex-
pansion is locally static uµ = (1, 0, 0, 0) though it pos-
sesses a nonzero expansion rate Θ ≡ ∇µuµ = 3 ˙a/a. In
the hydrodynamic approximation the matter stress ten-
sor can be written as [2]

Tµν = T eq

µν + Πµν( ˙a,{ ˙a2, ¨a},··· ),

(3)

where Πµν represents the derivative corrections to the
equilibrium energy-momentum tensor T eq
In the
µν.
Landau-Lifshitz frame [3] the lowest order correction is

 = eq +O(cid:0) ˙a2, ¨a(cid:1) , P = P eq − ζ(∇· u) +O(cid:0) ˙a2, ¨a(cid:1) , (4)

where ζ is the bulk viscosity. There is no contribution
in (4) from the shear viscosity since the shear tensor
vanishes identically in FLRW. The leading order expres-
sion for the entropy production rate can be obtained [3]

from the stress-energy conservation uν∇µTµν = 0 com-
bined with the deﬁnition of the entropy density near-

For matter invariant under conformal transformations
ζ = 0 and the above expression is zero. In fact, in this
case there is no entropy production at any order in the
hydrodynamic derivative expansion (3).

One thus faces several challenges in understanding the
entropy production of realistic matter in an FLRW Uni-
verse. First and foremost, any model employed must not
be conformal in order to have long-lasting dissipative ef-
fects; second, it should be possible to reliably compute
Tµν beyond the leading order hydrodynamic approxima-
tion characterized by (4); and last, but not least, the
framework must possess a natural deﬁnition for the en-
tropy density away from equilibrium.
In this Letter we propose that a plasma state of
strongly interacting N = 2∗ supersymmetric SU (N )
gauge theory has precisely these properties and we solve
for its dynamics in FLRW backgrounds (1) using holog-
raphy [4–6]. The deconﬁned phase of strongly interacting
N = 2∗ gauge theory is a close cousin of the Quark-Gluon
Plasma (QGP) discovered in ultrarelativistic heavy ion
collisions [7, 8]. The QGP formed in these nuclear col-
lisions, also called Little Bangs in analogy to Big Bang
cosmology, provides an example of a strongly interacting
relativistic ﬂuid [9]. Understanding the properties of the
solutions of the relativistic hydrodynamics equations has
been one of the focal points of activity in high energy
nuclear physics and, through holography, also gravita-
tional physics.
In this context, the study presented in
this Letter is part of the recent ongoing eﬀorts towards
understanding the emergence of relativistic hydrodynam-
ics both at strong [10, 11] and weak coupling [12–14] and
also its behaviour in the presence of large gradients.
N = 2∗ gauge theory in FLRW.— N = 2∗ gauge theory

arises as a relevant deformation of conformal N = 4 Su-
per Yang-Mills (SYM) theory by adding masses to some
of its bosonic and fermionic ﬁelds [15]. This corresponds,
respectively, to a relevant deformation with ∆ = 2 and
∆ = 3 scalar operators schematically denoted by Ob
and Of . The holographic description of N = 2∗ gauge
theory at strong coupling is given by the eﬀective ﬁve-
dimensional action [16]

The gravitational bulk scalars α and χ represent, holo-
graphically, the dimension ∆ = 2 and ∆ = 3 opera-
tors (the bosonic mb and the fermionic mf mass terms).
The ﬁve-dimensional Newton’s constant is G5 = 4π/N 2
(we set the asymptotic AdS5 radius L = 2). We use
the characteristic formulation of gravitational dynamics
in asymptotically AdS spacetimes summarized in [17] to
describe non-equilibrium states of N = 2∗ gauge theory
in FLRW. Assuming homogeneity and isotropy in the
spatial boundary coordinates x = {x, y, z} leads to the
5-dimensional metric Ansatz

5 = 2dt (dr − Adt) + Σ2 dx2,

The initial state of the gauge theory is speciﬁed by pro-
viding the scalar proﬁles α(0, r) and χ(0, r) and solv-
ing the constraint (10) subject to the boundary con-
ditions (12). Eqs. (9) can then be used to dynami-
cally evolve the state. The subleading terms in the
near-boundary expansion of the metric functions and the
scalars encode the non-equilibrium energy density , pres-
sure P , and the expectation values of the operators Ob
and Of . Explicit formulas for these observables can be
found in the Supplemental material.

An advantage of the holographic formulation is the
natural deﬁnition of the dynamical, far-from-equilibrium
entropy density at strong coupling: following [19, 20] we
associate the non-equilibrium entropy density s with the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the apparent horizon in
the geometry (8), a3s = N 2Σ3/(16π)|r=rh , where rh is
the location of the apparent horizon determined from
d+Σ|r=rh = 0, see Ref. [17]. Taking the derivative of
the entropy density and using Eqs. (9)-(11) we ﬁnd

Numerical simulations are required to determine the
properties of the N = 2∗ gauge theory in FLRW for
generic values of the masses (12); in what follows we con-
sider the limit when the mass parameters mb and mf are
much smaller than the local temperature T . This ap-
proximation captures all the essential physics and at the
same time allows for the semi-analytic calculations.

It is clear (see [21]) that the stress tensor (15) arises from
a conformal transformation performed on an equilibrium
state in Minkowski while redeﬁning the time variable to

bring the background metric to take the FLRW form (1).
As it follows directly from Eq. (15), there is no entropy
production for conformal ﬁeld theories to all orders in the
derivative expansion: d(a3s)/dt = 0.
To proceed beyond scale invariance, we linearize the
bulk scalar equations φ∆ = {α, χ}, ∆ = {2, 3} cor-
respondingly, on the AdS-FLRW-Schwarzschild solu-
tion (13):

where d+ is computed with A from Eq. (13). We solve
Eq. (16) with φ∆(t, r) satisfying the boundary conditions
deﬁned by Eq. (12) and being regular for r ∈ (rh ≡
µ/a, +∞). Although we are not directly interested in the
dynamics of expectation values of Ob and Of operators,
solving Eq. (16) is the crucial point of this Letter as,
via Eq. (13), it will provide us with the estimate of the
entropy production rate.

Hydrodynamics at large orders and resurgence.— Quite
remarkably, the recursion relation (18) can be solved in
a closed form. For single-component cosmologies, a(t) =

(23)
Due to the factorial growth of the coeﬃcient T∆,n at
large n, the hydrodynamic expansion has zero radius of
convergence provided F∆,n(1) does not vanish too fast
with n. To see that this is not the case, we solved nu-
merically Eqs. (19) for ∆ = 2 and 3 up to n = 300.
The N = 2∗ plasma in FLRW geometry (1) is a gen-
uinely new kind of relativistic ﬂow in which the hydro-
dynamic gradient expansion diverges. The only other
known example [23–26] is the so-called Bjorken expan-
sion relevant for the QGP dynamics in heavy-ion col-
lisions [27].
In the present situation it is the expand-
ing spatial volume (1) that drives the system’s dynamics
due to its broken conformal symmetry, as opposed to the
shear strain responsible for the dissipative nature of the
Bjorken ﬂow explored in [23–26]. Thus, our results probe
a completely diﬀerent set of contributions to the stress
energy tensor in the hydrodynamic regime.

Remarkably, hydrodynamics has been recently rec-
ognized as a fruitful new ground [24–26] for exploring
ideas related to resurgence, i.e. the information carried
by asymptotic expansions about their non-perturbative
completion and the means of their resummation. This is
a very active area of research which sheds new light on the
structure of quantum mechanical systems, see e.g. [28–
33]. The ability to solve the recursion relation (23) ex-
actly, as well as Eq. (19) numerically with (in princi-
ple) arbitrarily high precision, allows us to bring new
insights on the resurgent structure of hydrodynamic the-
ories, which we discuss below.

For simplicity, we focus on de Sitter cosmology

a = eH t,

(24)

which can be obtained from Eq. (23) by taking the limit
ω → −1. In this case we obtain

T∆,n[a] = Γ(n + 4 − ∆)anH n.

(25)

Let us know investigate in detail the properties of Ω∆
deﬁned in Eq. (21), i.e. (the square root of) the contri-
bution to the entropy production from the operator of

dimension ∆. It schematically reads

The hydrodynamic series may be viewed as a perturba-
tive expansion in g (cid:28) 1 valid for moderate times. The

where the contour C connects 0 and ∞. The analytic con-
tinuation of the Borel transform, performed using Pad´e
approximants for truncated series such as (26), reveals at
least the leading (i.e. closest to the origin on the com-
plex Borel plane) singularity responsible for the zero ra-
dius of convergence of the original series. The presence of
such singularities make the Borel summation ambiguous
(via the choice of contour C), which requires introducing
additional terms to the series to cancel the ambiguities.
In hydrodynamic theories undergoing Bjorken expansion,
the position of the singularity closest to the origin – the
beginning of a branch cut – has been associated in [23–26]
with the lowest exponentially decaying mode present in
the microscopic theory which goes beyond the stress ten-
sor ansatz analogous to Eq. (3) [34]. For the Bjorken ﬂow
in N = 4 SYM this contribution was matched with the
lowest non-hydrodynamic Quasinormal Mode (QNM) of
AdS-Schwarzschild black brane [23]. However, the pres-
ence of other singularities on the complex Borel plane
remained obscured by Pad´e approximation used in [23],
which is known to break down along branch-cuts [35]. In
the present case, the situation is simpler since the singu-
larities turn out to have the structure of single poles.

It is clear from Eq. (29) that the ambiguity in choosing
the contour below or above a pole at some value of ξ0 is
the residue of the integrand. The latter (at small g) is

δΩ(R)

∆ ∼ e−ξ0/g,

i.e. non-perturbative in g at small g. On the other hand,
the QNMs are non-hydrodynamic excitations of the mi-

which we checked numerically. Fig. 1 depicts the posi-
tions of the ﬁrst 10 singularities closest to the origin (ξ0)

hydrodynamic series for Ω(B)
∆=3. Quite re-
markably, they match at the level of a fraction of per-
cent or better with the frequencies of the 10 lowest non-
hydrodynamic QNM frequencies for ∆ = 2 and ∆ = 3 op-
erators in the AdS-Schwarzschild background [36]. Sys-
tematic improvements of the accuracy of our calculations
should allow to recover more frequencies. Our result thus
clearly demonstrates, for the ﬁrst time, that hydrody-
namic theory must know about its whole high frequency

completion via the large-order structure of the gradient
expansion. Also, the striking match between the singu-
larities of the analytically continued Borel transform and
the QNM frequencies obtained in [36] using very diﬀerent
methods is a highly nontrivial check of our calculations.
One ﬁnal comment about the resurgent structure of
the hydrodynamic expansion is in order. Our calcula-
tions are performed in the regime where the scalars do
not backreact the AdS-Schwarzschild geometry. Upon
including subleading corrections to the equations of mo-
tion in the small-mass expansion we expect to recover the
QNMs of N = 2∗ plasma computed in [38]. Also, such
analysis is expected to reveal additional singularities on
the complex Borel plane at positive integer multiples of
the N = 2∗ QNMs, which arise from nonlinear eﬀects in
the equations of motion (9) that we neglected.

We veriﬁed that higher k corrections in (34) do no
spoil this result. The entropy production rate (36) is
completely determined by the coupling constant of the
relevant operator (mf in this case):
the information
about the plasma initial state is ’lost’ since the non-
hydrodynamic regime occurs for late times of the de Sit-
ter expansion. In this sense the late time solution (35)
realizes the universal attractor of [24].

Discussion.— Dissipative eﬀects in any realistic matter
make the cosmological expansion of the Universe an irre-
versible process resulting in entropy production. In this
Letter we discussed the entropy production in an FLRW
Universe using a holographic model – the strongly cou-
pled plasma phase of N = 2∗ gauge theory.

To leading order in the hydrodynamic approximation
the entropy production in the homogeneous and isotropic
expansion is governed by the bulk viscosity. Quite re-
markably, holography allowed us to show that subse-
quent corrections form a series with zero radius of con-
vergence, see Eq. (23). As a result, N = 2∗ matter
in FLRW provides the ﬁrst example of hydrodynamic
ﬂow without conformal invariance for which this prop-
erty has been identiﬁed. One of the key new features
on this front revealed by our investigations is the resur-
gent structure of the hydrodynamic gradient expansion
which includes information about all the excitations of
the system, see Fig. 1.
Going beyond the near-equilibrium regime when
KN (cid:29) 1 (for the de Sitter expansion), we computed the
resummed entropy production rate, see Eq. (37). We
showed that the latter deviates substantially from the
leading hydrodynamic approximation: if the leading ef-
fect of the conformal symmetry breaking in plasma is due
to an operator of dimension ∆ > 5
2 the production rate
is enhanced; it is suppressed otherwise.

It is straightforward to extend our results in the non-
hydrodynamic regime to other cosmological expansion
scenarios. For a radiation dominated scenario the non-
√
hydrodynamic regime happens close to the Big Bang sin-
gularity, i.e., when H ∝ 1/t (cid:29) T ∝ 1/
t, t → 0. In a
plasma where conformal symmetry is broken by a ∆ = 3
operator, we ﬁnd that the resummed entropy production
rate is ∝ 1/t, with logarithmically divergent entropy pro-
duction as one approaches the Big Bang. This should be
√
contrasted with the leading order hydrodynamic approx-
imation where the production rate is ∝ 1/
t and, thus,
a vanishingly small amount of entropy is produced in the
limit t → 0. It is unclear if the predicted enhancement
have observable consequences in our Universe. Our anal-
ysis applies to a strongly coupled plasma and the non-
hydrodynamic regime of the plasma expansion would oc-
cur when the local temperature T >> Mp, the Planck
scale.
In standard quantum gravity models the QGP
would be weakly coupled at already sub-Planckian tem-
peratures and it should be by then well described by ki-
netic theory [39]. This last point underscores the impor-
tance of extending our analysis to weakly coupled gauge

theories. A ﬁrst step towards this direction involves gen-
eralizing the recent FLRW exact kinetic theory results of
Ref. [40] to include the leading order eﬀects of nonzero
particle masses and investigate the resurgent properties
of its hydrodynamic expansion.

Finally,

let us mention that our studies of the re-
summed entropy production rate in the Universe parallel
ideas explored in Ref. [41] regarding the role of the re-
summed hydrodynamic gradient expansion in theoretical
description of the QGP in heavy ion collisions.

Holographic renormalization.— The holographic renor-
malization of N = 2∗ gauge theory has been discussed
in detail in [45, 51–53] and more recently in [48]. Fol-
lowing these analyses we compute the energy density ,
the pressure P , and the expectation values of the opera-
tors Of and Ob sourced by the fermionic and the bosonic
masses in terms of the normalizable parameters α2,0(t)
and χ3,0(t) of the gravitational bulk scalars α and χ,
and the normalizable parameter a2,0(t) of the bulk met-
ric warp factor A (see [48] for more details):

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL

Microscopics of the model.— N = 2∗ gauge theory is ob-
tained as a deformation of the maximally supersymmetric
SU (N ) Yang-Mills theory. The ﬁeld content of N = 4
SYM theory includes the gauge ﬁeld Aµ, four Majorana
fermions ψa, and three complex scalars φi, all in the ad-
joint representation. SYM theory can be deformed by
adding two independent ‘mass’ terms [42]

The relevant deformation (38) breaks scale invariance
and, when mb = mf , half of the supersymmetries of the
parent SYM; for general mass parameters mb (cid:54)= mf su-
persymmetry is completely broken. In the planar limit
and for large ’t Hooft coupling, N = 2∗ gauge theory
possesses a holographically dual gravitational description
[16, 43] which provides an opportunity to study its ther-
modynamic [18, 44], hydrodynamic [22, 45–47], and far
from equilibrium properties [38, 48]. The duality between
N = 2∗ gauge theory at strong coupling and the grav-
itational Pilch-Warner eﬀective action [16] (PW) allows
for precision tests of the holographic correspondence in a
nonconformal setting [49, 50].

We now compute the energy density and the pressure
of the N = 2∗ plasma in an FLRW Universe in the hydro-
dynamic approximation. From the general expressions
(40) and (41), we note that the bosonic and fermionic
