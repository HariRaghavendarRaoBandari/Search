THE PARABOLIC ALGEBRA ON BANACH SPACES

E. KASTIS

Abstract. The parabolic algebra was introduced by Katavolos and Power, in 1997, as
the operator algebra acting on L2(R) that is weakly generated by the translation and
multiplication semigroups. In particular, they proved that this algebra is reﬂexive and is
equal to the Fourier binest algebra, that is, to the algebra of operators that leave invariant
the subspaces of the Volterra nest and its analytic counterpart.

We prove that a similar result holds for the corresponding algebras acting on Lp(R),
where 1 < p < ∞. It is also shown that the reﬂexive closures of the Fourier binests on
Lp(R) are all order isomorphic for 1 < p < ∞.

Let {Dµ, µ ∈ R} and {Mλ, λ ∈ R} be the groups of translation and multiplication

respectively acting on the Hilbert space L2(R), given by

1. Introduction

Dµf (x) = f (x − µ), Mλf (x) = eiλxf (x).

It is well-known that these 1-parameter unitary groups are continuous in the strong
operator topology (SOT), that they provide an irreducible representation of the Weyl-
commutation relations, MλDµ = eiλµDµMλ, and that the SOT-closed operator algebra
they generate is the von Neumann algebra B(L2(R)) of all bounded operators. (See Tay-
lor [22], for example.) On the other hand it was shown by Katavolos and Power in [11] that
the strongly closed nonselfadjoint operator algebra generated by the semigroups for µ ≥ 0
and λ ≥ 0 is a reﬂexive algebra, in the sense of Halmos [17], containing no self-adjoint
operators, other than real multiples of the identity, and containing no nonzero ﬁnite rank
par on Lp(R) for 1 < p < ∞, which are
operators. We consider here the operator algebras Ap
similarly generated by the same semigroups, viewed now as bounded operators on Lp(R).
Our main result is that Ap

operators that leave invariant each subspace in the Fourier binest Lp

given by

par is also reﬂexive and, moreover, is equal to Ap

F B = {0} ∪ {Lp[t,∞), t ∈ R} ∪ {eiλxH p(R), λ ∈ R} ∪ {Lp(R)}

where H p(R) is the usual Hardy space for the upper half plane. This lattice of closed sub-
spaces is a binest equal to the union of two complete continuous nests of closed subspaces.

Although the reﬂexivity of non selfadjoint operator algebras has been studied intensively
over the last ﬁfty years, the developments have been largely conﬁned within the limits of
operator algebras acting on Hilbert spaces. For example, general nest algebras, being the

most characteristic class of reﬂexive noncommutative non selfadjoint operator algebras
since they were introduced by Ringrose in 1965 [19], have a well-developed general theory
on Hilbert spaces (Davidson [4]). However, only sporadic results can be found for nest
algebras on Banach spaces (see [23], [21], [3]).

On the other hand, the study of the reﬂexivity of non-selfadjoint algebras that are
generated by semigroups of operators was begun by Sarason in 1966 [20], where he proved
that H ∞(R), viewed as a multiplication algebra on H 2(R), is reﬂexive. Since then, several
results about 2-parameter Lie semigroup algebras have been obtained. One of the aims
in the analysis of reﬂexivity and related properties is to understand better the algebraic
structure of these somewhat mysterious algebras. Establishing reﬂexivity can provide
a route to constructing operators in the algebra and thereby deriving further algebraic
properties. As we stated above, the reﬂexivity of A2
par, known as the parabolic algebra,
was obtained in [11]. Furthermore, Levene and Power have shown ([14]) the reﬂexivity
of an analogous hyperbolic algebra[12], the algebra generated by the multiplication and
dilation semigroups on L2(R). The latter semigroup is given by the operators Vt, with

Vtf (x) = et/2f (etx),

for t ≥ 0. Recently, Power and the author proved that the triple semigroup operator
algebra that is generated by the translation, dilation and multiplication semigroups is also
reﬂexive [10].

A complication in establishing the reﬂexivity of the parabolic and hyperbolic algebras
on Hilbert space is the absence of an approximate identity of ﬁnite rank operators, a key
device in the theory of nest algebras (Erdos and Power [6], Davidson [4]). However, it
was shown that the subspace of Hilbert-Schmidt operators is dense for both algebras and
that these operators could be used as an alternative. On the other hand, we note that
diﬀerent reﬂexivity techniques were given in [1], where the authors make use of direct
integral decomposition arguments. In our case, we deﬁne a left ideal of what we refer to as
(p, q)-integral operators which we show is able to play the role of the (two-sided) ideal of
Hilbert - Schmidt operators. As a substitute for the techniques of Hilbert space geometry
and tensor product identiﬁcations used in [10], [11], [14], we make use of more involved
measure theoretic arguments appropriate for the (p, q)-integrable operators.

We also obtain a number of properties of the parabolic algebra on Lp(R), that correspond

2. Preliminaries

2.1. The Hardy space H p(R), p ∈ [1,∞). We start with two elementary density lemmas
for the Hardy spaces H p(R) on the line, for p ∈ (1,∞). The details of the theory of Hardy
spaces can be found in [8].

For each u in the upper half plane H+ of C let

Then bu lies in H p(R), for every p ∈ (1,∞).

Lemma 2.1. The linear spans of the sets D1 = {bu|u ∈ H+}, D2 = {bubw|u, w ∈ H+} are
both dense in H p(R), for 1 < p < ∞.
Proof. Fix some p ∈ (1,∞) and suppose that there exists some f ∈ H p(R) that does not
lie in the closed linear span of D1. Then by the Hahn - Banach theorem, there is some
function g ∈ Lq(R), such that RR bug = 0, for all u ∈ H+, and RR f g 6= 0. But
dx = 0, ∀u ∈ H+ ⇔ g ∈ H q(R)

bug = 0, ∀u ∈ H+ ⇔ZR

ZR

g(x)
x + u

Hence f g ∈ H 1(R), so RR f g = 0, which gives a contradiction.
Now, for any distinct u, w ∈ H+, observe that

Deﬁne

bu(x) − bw(x)

w − u

.

hn(x) = (ni − u)(bu(x) − bni(x)) =

x + u −

x + ni

.

Since hn → bu pointwise, as n → ∞, and hn(x) ≤ h1(x), forall x ∈ R, it follows from
k·kp→ bu. Therefore, given u ∈ H+, the function bu lies in
dominated convergence that hn
the closed linear span of D2, so by the ﬁrst part of the lemma, the proof is complete. (cid:3)

Lemma 2.2. For every t ∈ R the countable set

Λt = {buDtbw|u, w ∈ H+ ∪ Q}

is dense in H p(R), for every p ∈ (1,∞).
Proof. Observe ﬁrst that

Dtbw(x) =

1

(x − t) + w

=

x + (w − t)

= bw−t(x), x ∈ R.

Since Q is dense in R, the rest of the proof is a simple application of dominated convergence.

The Beurling-Lax theorem in the Lp-setting will be useful for the determination of the

lattice of Ap

Theorem 2.3. Given p ∈ (1,∞), let M be a closed subspace of Lp(R) which is invariant
under the semigroup {Mλ, λ ≥ 0}. Then M is either of the form Lp(E) for some Borel
subset E ⊆ R or M is equal to φH p(R) for some unimodular function φ.

2.2. The space Lp(R; Lq(R)), for 1 < p, q < ∞. We now introduce some notation and
terminology associated with the classical space Lp(R; Lq(R)). This space is a space of
kernel functions for what we refer to as the (p, q)-integrable operators. For more details,
we refer the reader to [15],[16].

Let p, q ∈ [1, +∞]. Deﬁne S(R; Lq(R)) be the space of measurable simple functions; i.e.

the functions f : R → Lq(R) taking only ﬁnite many values :

n

f (x) =

χAk (x)gk,

Xk=1

where {Ak}k=1,...,n is a ﬁnite family of Borel measurable pairwise disjoint sets and where
gk ∈ Lq(R).
Deﬁnition 2.4. A function f : R → Lq(R) is said to be strongly measurable if there is
a sequence (fn) in S(R; Lq(R)), tending to f pointwise. Also, f is weakly measurable, if
given ω ∈ (Lq(R))∗ the function t 7→ ω(f (t)) is Borel measurable.

The relationship between strong and weak measurability is given by the following the-

orem of Pettis [15], who introduced the notion of almost separably valued functions.
Deﬁnition 2.5. Let 1 ≤ q ≤ ∞. A function f : R → Lq(R) is almost separably valued,
if there is a conull Borel set A ⊆ R, such that f (A) is separable.
Theorem 2.6. A function f : R → Lq(R) is strongly measurable if and only if it is weakly
measurable and almost separably valued.
Example 2.7. Deﬁne f : R → L∞(R) by f (x) = χ(−∞,x]. Then f is not almost separably
valued, and hence not strongly measurable, since kf (x) − f (t)k∞ = 1 for x 6= t. However,
for q ∈ (1,∞), the function g : R → Lq(R), given by g(x) = χ(−∞,x]f , where f ∈ Lq(R),
is strongly measurable. To see this, note that Lq(R) is separable and given ω ∈ Lp(R),
where p is the conjugate exponent of q, we have

ω(g(x)) =ZR

ω(y)χ(−∞,x](y)f (y)dy =Z x

−∞

ω(y)f (y)dy,

which is measurable, being the limit of absolutely continuous functions.

The deﬁnition of Lp spaces of Lq-valued functions is analogous to the case of scalar valued
functions. Deﬁne Lp(R; Lq(R)) as the set of equivalence classes (modulo equality for almost

qdx(cid:1)1/p < ∞ for
every x ∈ R) of strongly measurable functions f that satisfy (cid:0)RR kf (x)kp
1 ≤ p < ∞, and esssupkf (·)kq for p = ∞. Each of the above spaces endowed with the
respective norm

kfkp,q =(cid:18)ZR kf (x)kp

qdx(cid:19)1/p

, for p ∈ [1,∞),

kfk∞,q = esssupkf (·)kq , for p = ∞,

becomes a Banach space.

Remark 2.8. In the case p = q = 2 we have the natural isomorphisms

.

L2(R; L2(R)) ∼= L2(R) ⊗ L2(R) ∼= L2(R2)

For the rest of the paragraph, the exponents p, q lie on the open interval (1,∞). Given

f1, f2, . . . , fn ∈ Lp(R) and g1, g2, . . . , gn ∈ Lq(R), deﬁne

We denote this function by

fk ⊗ χAk, where {Ak}k=1,...,n is a partition of the real line.

Proposition 2.9. The following sets are dense in Lp(R; Lq(R)).

(1) S(R; Lq(R)) ∩ Lp(R; Lq(R));
(2) F(R; Lq(R)) ∩ Lp(R; Lq(R));
(3) F(R; S(R)) ∩ Lp(R; Lq(R)).

Proof.

(1) Let f ∈ Lp(R; Lq(R)). Let (fn)n∈N be a sequence of measurable step func-

tions, that converge to f pointwise, that is fn(x)

k·kq→ f (x) pointwise. Deﬁne

gn(x) = fn(x)χ(kfnk<2kf k)(x).

Then gn ∈ S(R; Lq(R) ∩ Lp(R; Lq(R)), for every n ∈ R, gn → f pointwise, and

supnkgn − fkp,q ≤ supnkgnkp,q + kfkp,q ≥ 3kfkp,q.

Hence by dominated convergence, we get gn

(2) This part is evident, since S(R; Lq(R)) ∩ Lp(R; Lq(R)) is a subspace of
F(R; Lq(R)) ∩ Lp(R; Lq(R)).
(3) It suﬃces to prove that given f ∈ Lp(R), g ∈ Lq(R), we can ﬁnd a sequence (fn)
of elements in F(R; S(R)) ∩ Lp(R; Lq(R)), that converges to f ⊗ g with respect to
the k·kp,q norm. By the classical theory of Lq spaces, there is a sequence of simple
functions

k·kp,q→ f .

gn =

such that gn → g in Lq(R). Then the functions f ⊗ gn lie in

kf ⊗ gn − f ⊗ gkp.q = kfkpkgn − gkq → 0.

(cid:3)

The characterization of the dual space of Lp(R; Lq(R)) is again analogous to the scalar-

valued case, after we take account of duality in the range space Lq(R).

Proposition 2.10. The dual space of Lp(R; Lq(R)) is isometrically isomorphic to Lq(R; Lp(R)).
Lemma 2.11. Given an operator T ∈ B(Lp(R)), there is a unique bounded linear operator

˜T : Lp(R; Lq(R)) → Lp(R; Lq(R))

6

such that given f ⊗ g ∈ F(R; Lq(R))

˜T (f ⊗ g) = T f ⊗ g.

Proof. Let f (x) =

fk(x)χAk , such that fk ∈ Lp(R) and {Ak}k=1,...,n pairwise disjoint

Borel sets. By linearity, calculate

Since the set F(R; S(R))∩Lp(R; Lq(R)) is dense in Lp(R; Lq(R)), the proof is complete. (cid:3)

∆φ : Lp(R) → Lp(R) : f 7→ φ ∗ f,

is bounded. Furthermore, if φ has essential support in R+, then ∆φ belongs to the SOT-
closed algebra generated by {Dt | t ∈ R+}.
Proof. Consider f ∈ (L2∩ Lp)(R) and let F be the Fourier-Plancherel transform on L2(R).
Then

(F ∆φF ∗f )(x) = ( ˆφf )(x).

Hence on the dense subspace (L2 ∩ Lp)(R) of Lp(R), we obtain

∆φ = F ∗M ˆφF = JD ˆφJ ∗ = DJ ˆφ,

where J is the ﬂip operator, given by (Jf )(x) = f (−x). Since φ ∈ L1(R+), it follows that
ˆφ ∈ H ∞(R), which yields that J ˆφ ∈ H ∞(R). Therefore, ∆φ ∈ SOT−alg{Dt | t ∈ R+}. (cid:3)

The following proposition and proof follow the pattern of the proof for the existence of

a bounded approximate identity on A2

Proof. Take hn(x) = ni
x+ni and φn(y) = nχ[0,1/n](y). It’s trivial to see that hn and φn lie
in H r(R) and Lr(R+), respectively, for every r ∈ (1,∞). Let kn = Θ−1(hn ⊗ φn), so
kIntknk ≤ khnk∞kφnk1 ≤ 1. Since hn → 1 uniformly on compact sets of the real line, it

4. The lattice of the parabolic algebra

Let K p

λ,s = MλMφsH p(R) where φs(x) = e−isx2/2. This is evidently an invariant subspace
for the multiplication semigroup and for s ≥ 0 one can check that it is invariant for the
translation semigroup. Thus for s ≥ 0 the nest Ns = Mφs Na is contained in LatAp
par and
these nests are distinct. In fact any two nontrivial subspaces from nests with distinct s
parameter have trivial intersection. Suppose now that p = 2. With the strong operator
topology for the associated orthogonal subspace projections it can be shown that the set
of these nests for s ≥ 0, together with the Volterra nest N2
v, is homeomorphic to the closed
unit disc. A cocycle argument given in [11] leads to the fact that every invariant subspace
for A2

par is of this form for p = 2. Thus we get

(4.1)

LatA2

par = {K 2

λ,s|λ ∈ R, s ≥ 0} ∪ Nv

We will prove now the corresponding result for the general case of Ap

par, where 1 < p <

∞.

Let K be a non-trivial element of LatAp

par. By the Beurling - Lax theorem, either
K = Lp(E) for some Borel set E ⊆ R or K = MφH p(R) for some unimodular function
φ. On the other hand, the subspace K ∩ L2(R) is invariant under the Weyl semigroup.
Therefore, the k · k2-closed linear span of K ∩ L2(R) lies in LatA2
par. Hence, according to
the Beurling -Lax theorem, we have two cases. In the ﬁrst case, where K = Lp(E), then

Lp(E) ∩ L2(R)

∈ LatA2

par ⇒ L2(E) ∈ LatA2

par ⇒ E = [t,∞),

k·k2

for some t ∈ R. In the second case, K = MφH p(R), which implies

MφH p(R) ∩ L2(R)

∈ LatA2

par ⇒ MφH 2(R) ∈ LatA2

par ⇒ Mφ = MφsMλ,

k·k2

for some s ∈ [0, +∞), λ ∈ R. Hence, we obtained the following result.
Theorem 4.1. Given p ∈ (1,∞), the invariant subspace lattice of the algebra Ap

λ,s|λ ∈ R, s ≥ 0} ∪ Np
Remark 4.2. In [11], Katavolos and Power proved that LatA2
par, viewed as a topological
space of projections on L2(R), endowed with the strong operator topology, is homeomor-
phic to the closed unit disc. In particular, they obtained the so-called strange limit

par = {K p

v

par is

PK 2

SOT→ PL2[λ,+∞), as s → ∞,

which relies on the Paley - Wiener theorem and the fact that the Fourier transform is uni-
tary on L2(R). Even though the Riesz projection from Lp(R) onto H p(R) remains bounded,
it is unknown to the author if the above convergence still holds, for p ∈ (1, +∞)\{2}.

THE PARABOLIC ALGEBRA ON BANACH SPACES

13

We expect that the operator algebras Ap

par, for 1 < p < ∞, are pairwise non isomorphic,
even as rings of linear operators. However, the standard methods for such a demonstration
(which go back to Eidelheit [5]) rely on exploiting the presence of rank one operators to
deduce an isomorphism between the underlying Banach spaces. Possibly the (p, q)-integral
operators could once again play such a substitute role.
