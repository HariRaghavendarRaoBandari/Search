Abstract

considered. Control force is applied to the boundary of the membrane, which is located in a domain

on a plane. The goal of the control is to drive the system to rest in a ﬁnite time.

Introduction

The problem of exact boundary controllability of oscillations of a plane membrane is considered.
Control force has the restriction on its absolute value. We will prove that the plane membrane can be

driven to rest in a ﬁnite time. Exact mathematical deﬁnitions will be provided. It should be noted, that
the given method for the proof in this article can be used in case of any other dimension, but here the

two-dimensional case is provided for clear and simple presentation.

The problem of full stabilization in a ﬁnite time in case of the distributed control is described in the

monograph [1]. This reference also contains the upper estimate for an optimal control time.

Earlier the question of the control of oscillations of a plane membrane by means of boundary forces is

considered by many authors (i. g. overviews of D. L. Russell [2] and J. Lions [3], as well as the literature
provided there). The monograph [4] describes the task of stabilizing oscillations of a restricted string

by means of the boundary control, and proves that vibrations of the string can be driven to rest in a
ﬁnite time under the condition of restriction imposed on an absolute value of the control function, and

estimate is provided for the time that is necessary for full stop. In monograph [5] problems of the optimal

control of systems with distributed parameters are studied and optimal conditions are stated, which are
similar to conditions for systems with ﬁnite number of freedom’s degrees. Although this method does not

provide constructive technique for ﬁnding an optimal control in many cases. In synoptic article [3] the
problem of exact zero-controllability of a membrane is considered, the existence of the boundary control

is proved and the time estimate is given, which is required for driving to rest. Here authors while studying
the problem in various formulations often reject the requirement of optimality of the control and solve

only the problem of controllability, which is much easier. What is more, problems with restrictions of

the force’s absolute value are not considered, and explicit forms for control functions are not found, only
theorems of existence are proved.

The statement of the problem in the article essentially diﬀers from the one in [2] and [3], because the
value of control force on the boundary has to satisfy the condition: |u(t, x)| 6 ε. Note, here the aim is to

ﬁnd not an optimal control, but the admissible (satisfying initial restrictions) control.

2 The statement of the problem

Let us consider the initial-boundary value problem for the two-dimensional wave equation:

wtt(t, x) − ∆w(t, x) = 0,

(t, x) ∈ QT = (0, T ) × Ω,

w|t=0 = ϕ(x), wt|t=0 = ψ(x),

x ∈ Ω,

∂w
∂ν

= u(t, x),

(t, x) ∈ Σ,

(1)

(2)

(3)

where Ω is a domain with a smooth boundary (including additional conditions, which are necessary for

existence and uniqueness of the solution), ν — the outer normal to the boundary of the domain Ω, Σ is
a lateral surface of a cylinder QT . Initial data ϕ(x) and ψ(x) are given and will be chosen in suitable
Hilbert spaces, u(t, x) is a control function deﬁned on the boundary of Ω.

Let ε > 0 be an given arbitrary number. Let us impose the constraint on the control function:

|u(t, x)| 6 ε,

(4)

The problem is to construct a control u(t, x) satisfying inequality (4) such that the corresponding

solution w(t, x) to the initial-boundary value problem (1)—(3) and its derivative with respect to t becomes
zero at some time T , i.e.

w(T, x) = 0, wt(T, x) = 0,

(5)

for all x ∈ Ω. If we obtained a control u(t, x) such that conditions (5) are achieved then the system
(1)—(3) is called controllable to rest.

The following theorem is the main result of this article.
Theorem 1. Let ϕ(x) ∈ H 7(Ω) and ψ(x) ∈ H 6(Ω) such that

∂ϕ(x)

∂ν

= 0, ψ(x) = 0, x ∈ ∂Ω.

(6)

Then there are time T and the control function u(t, x) ∈ C(Σ), satisfying the restriction (4), such that

the system (1)—(3) is controllable to rest.

The proof of the theorem 1 consists of two steps. The ﬁrst step stabilizes the considered solution and
its ﬁrst derivative with respect to t in a small vicinity of zero in the norm of C5(Ω) × C4(Ω), and the
second step allows to drive to rest the system in this small vicinity.

3 The ﬁrst step of the control

Here we state the task to stabilize a pair (w(t, x), wt(t, x)) in arbitrarily small vicinity of zero in the
norm of the space C5,4(Ω) = C5(Ω) × C4(Ω) where w(t, x) is a the solution to the system (1)—(3) and

2

wt(t, x) is its ﬁrst derivative with respect to t. What is more the control function should satisfy the
restriction (4).

We use the results of [2] for this purpose. The research considers a friction which is introduced on the

boundary (or on a part of it) of Ω. The friction is given by the ﬁrst derivative of w(t, x) with respect to
t, i.e. the initial-boundary value problem (1), (2) with boundary condition

∂w(t, x)

∂ν

= −k

∂w(t, x)

∂t

,

(7)

where k > 0 is a friction coeﬃcient.

According to the theorem’s condition we have ϕ(x) ∈ H 7(Ω) and ψ(x) ∈ H 6(Ω). It is known that
in this case the solution w(t, x) to the problem (1), (2), (7) such that w(t, x) ∈ C([0, +∞); H 7(Ω))
and wt(t, x) ∈ C([0, +∞); H 6(Ω)). We note that it is necessary for ϕ(x), ψ(x) to satisfy the following
condition:

∂ϕ(x)

∂ν

= −kψ(x), x ∈ ∂Ω.

(8)

By virtue of (6) condition (8) is done for any k.

Let us consider the energy of the system (1), (2), (7):

E(t) =ZΩ (cid:0)w2

x1 (t, x) + w2

x2 (t, x) + w2

t (t, x)(cid:1) dx.

In [2] is proven, because of the presence of friction on the boundary the dissipation of the system’s

energy occurs, that

(9)

(10)

where C(ϕ, ψ) is a constant, depending on initial data of the system. Diﬀerentiating the equation (1),
initial conditions (2), and also boundary condition (7) with respect to x1 and x2, we obtain the estimate
for w(t, x):

Left side of the estimate (11) is truncated square of the norm in H 7(Ω) of the function w(t, ·). In order
to make the truncated norm a full one in H 7(Ω) we should get homogenous boundary conditions for
the function w(t, ·) itself and its derivatives with the respect to x1, x2 including derivatives of the ﬁfth
order (Friedrichs’ inequality). The operator of extension E is used for this purpose (see [6]). Let Ωδ be
δ-vicinity of the domain Ω. Linear continuous operator E acts on a function w(x) from H 7(Ω) to the
space

2o ,
eH 7(Ωδ) =nwe(x) ∈ H 7(Ωδ)| we(x) = 0, x ∈ Ωδ \ Ω δ

such so w(x) = we(x), if x ∈ Ω. Let us consider the integral

I(t) =ZΩδ

 X0<|α|67

|Dα

x we(t, x)|2 dx,

where t is ﬁxed. The suﬃcient smallness I(t) is derived from the construction of E, in case if the truncated

norm in H 7(Ω) is suﬃciently small. But in virtue of homogenous boundary conditions in eH 7(Ωδ) it follows
that integral I(t) is the square of the norm in eH 7(Ωδ), and hence Sobolev embedding theorem can be

As for wt(t, x) the situation is more trivial because from (10) we obtain

t > 0.

We solve the problem (1), (2), (7) with given initial conditions, then this solution is substituted to

the only right part of the equality (7), and we obtain the boundary condition (3) for the initial-boundary
value problem (1)—(3). In other words, we make the control function of the problem (1)—(3) be equal

to

u(t, x) = −k

∂w0(t, x)

∂t

,

where w0 is a solution to the problem (1), (2), (7).

Therefore it is proved (here we use Sobolev embedding theorem) that controlling for a long time, we

can make the values

kw(T1, ·)kC 5(Ω), kwt(T1, ·)kC 4(Ω)

arbitrary small at some time t = T1.

Now let us show, that the boundary control function u(t, x) can be suﬃciently small, i.e. we may

satisfy the restriction (4). Note that in virtue of (9)

Therefore we obtain

x1(x) + ϕ2

x2(x) + ψ2(x)(cid:1) dx.

x2 (x) + ψ2(x)(cid:1) dx,

t > 0.

In the last estimate of the integral, which is in the right side, depends on only initial data and does
not depend on the friction coeﬃcient. Hence diﬀerentiating the equation (1), initial condition (2) and
boundary conditions (3) with respect to x1, x2, and also using embedding theorems, we obtain the
restriction of absolute value of wt(t, x) on the closure of cylinder QT1 by constant, which depends on only
initial data. Choosing the coeﬃcient k is small enough, we have the condition (4) done.

4 The second step of the control

Now we have a task to drive the system to rest. A pair of functions

(w|t=0 = w(T1, x), wt|t=0 = wt(T1, x))

4

is considered to be new initial data for the problem (1)—(3). Remind that according to the fact proven
above these initial conditions are suﬃciently small in the norm of the space C5,4(Ω).

Again let us consider the domain Ωδ, which is δ-vicinity of the domain Ω. Also let take an arbitrary
pair (w0(x), w1(x)) from the space C5,4(Ω). Extend functions w0(x) and w1(x) on the whole plane R2 by
means of the bounded linear operator E1 so that supports of extended functions are in Ωδ, i = 0, 1. The
construction of the operator of E1 is identical to the construction of the operator E.

Let us consider the Cauchy problem for the equation of membrane’s oscillations on a plane R2:

wtt(t, x) − ∆w(t, x) = 0,

(t, x) ∈ Q = (0, +∞) × R2,

w|t=0 = we

0(x), wt|t=0 = we

x ∈ R2.

It is known that the solution to the problem (9), (10) has the form (Poisson’s formula):

We use the formula (14) for estimating the absolute value of the solution w(t, x) uniformly by the
initial data. The absolute value of w(t, x) is estimated in case x ∈ Ωδ. Compute the ﬁrst derivative with
respect to t in the right part of (14):

its derivative on the domain Ω should be considered. It is obvious that in virtue of (18) the following

Let wi(t, x) be the solution to the inverse Cauchy problem with conditions (20). In virtue of invertibility
of the equation (1) with respect to t the following estimate takes place:

1(x) + wi

t(0, x),

x ∈ R2,

(21)

(22)

identically equals zero in Ω as well as its ﬁrst derivative with respect to t at the time t = T2. Now let
us consider the restriction of the right parts of (22) in the domain Ω. We regard initial conditions (the

restriction of right parts of (22) in the domain Ω) in the problem of boundary controllability:

w|t=0 = w0(x) + wi,r(0, x), wt|t=0 = w1(x) + wi,r

t (0, x),

x ∈ Ω.

(23)

Note that it is the value of the corresponding solution to the Cauchy problem in R2 with initial conditions
(22) to determine the required control function on the boundary of Ω.

A pair (wi,r(0, x), wi,r

t (0, x)) is derived from pair (w0(x), w1(x)) by means of applying a linear con-
tinuous operator, let us denote it as L, with the norm less than 1 (consequence from estimates (19) and
(21)). Obviously the sums in right parts (23) generate all elements of the space C5,4(Ω). Indeed, (23) can
be written as:

(I + L)(w0(x), w1(x)) = (w|t=0, wt|t=0),

(24)

where I is the identical operator. Hence, as kLk < 1, so the operator I + L, which acts from C5,4(Ω) to
itself, is invertible.

Now let us represent the control function (second step) in the following form:

u(t, x) =

where R is a restriction from R2 to Ω and K T2

− are resolving operators of the Cauchy problem. We

Thus we have proven that the system with smooth initial conditions can be driven to rest by means

of extending them on the full plane. It is the method to extend determines a program of the boundary
control. Let us show now that if initial conditions have small enough absolute values, we can drive the

system to rest by means of a boundary control which has a small absolute value.

6

We regard that in the problem (1)—(3) the value of the solution w(t, x) and the value of its derivative

wt(t, x) at t = T1 are small enough in norms of spaces C5(Ω) and C4(Ω) respectively.

Let (w|t=0, wt|t=0) be rewritten according to the formula (23). As continuous operator I +L invertible,
so according to Banach’s theorem an invertible operator is continuous too. Hence choosing (w|t=0, wt|t=0)
suﬃciently small, we can make (w0(x), w1(x)) be suﬃciently small as well. Now let consider the sums
(23), which determine data (w|t=0, wt|t=0). Extending these sums on the whole plane by the method
above, we obtain initial data (22). So we can write down the solution to the Cauchy problem with initial

Summing up it is proved that the solution ws(t, x) can be made suﬃciently small in the norm C1(Ω)
for any t ∈ [0, T2]. The same argument may be applied to the solution of the inverse Cauchy problem
with initial conditions −ws,e
1 (T2, x) (see (26)). In this case it is important that functions
ws,e
0 (T2, x) and ws,e

Hence the restriction of normal derivative of the solution to the Cauchy problem (9), (10) on the boundary
