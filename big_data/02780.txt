Abstract

In many applications such as wireless communications and subband adaptive

ﬁltering, we need to design non-uniform ﬁlter banks (NUFB), which may lead

to better performances and reduced hardware complexity when compared to uni-

form ﬁlter bank. NUFB satisfying linear phase property for all the constituent

ﬁlters, are desirable in applications such as speech and image processing and in

communication. This paper proposes a novel design of non-uniform modiﬁed dis-

crete fourier transform ﬁlter bank (MDFT FB). Here, each non-uniform channel

is obtained by merging the nearby channels of a uniform MDFT FB. The reported

works of non-uniform cosine modulated ﬁlter banks (CMFBs) do not satisfy linear

phase property for all the constituent ﬁlters. In this work, we introduce the design

of a non-uniform MDFT FB which satisﬁes linear phase property for all the con-

stituent ﬁlters. The proposed design of the non-uniform MDFT FB is checked

utilizing the alias cancellation among the channels, distortion and ﬂatness condi-

tion of the channels. A condition is derived to ﬁnd the channels when merged

with adjacent channels, will cause aliasing in M channels. In the design and im-

plementation of the proposed non-uniform MDFT FB, the structure of the uniform

DFT ﬁlter bank, are guaranteed. Hence without increasing the design complexity,

the non-uniform MDFT FB is designed.

1. Introduction

Filter banks (FB) are used in many applications such as wireless communica-

tion, image compression, speech processing, sub-band coding and adaptive signal

processing (P.P.Vaidyanathan, 1993). Due to the simple design and easy realiza-

tion, modulated FB are more popular than other FB structures. Mainly there are

two types of modulated FB, Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) FB and Cosine

modulated ﬁlter bank (CMFB). Using the same prototype ﬁlter, the analysis and

synthesis FB are generated by modulation of the prototype ﬁlter. The resultant

DFT FB have analysis and synthesis ﬁlters which satisfy linear phase property if

the prototype ﬁlter is chosen to have linear phase. CMFB has only overall linear

phase. Hence DFT FB are preferred in many applications. However, DFT FB

have no inherent alias cancellation structure.

To overcome this disadvantage of DFT FB, modiﬁed DFT ﬁlter bank (MDFT

FB) can be used (Fliege, 1993, 1994a; Sakthivel et al., 2014; Sakthivel & Elias,

2015). MDFT FB provide linear phase in both the analysis and synthesis ﬁlters,

provided, the prototype ﬁlter is chosen to have linear phase. In MDFT FB, alias

cancellation is available in the structure, which will automatically cancel all the

odd alias spectra. This leads to near perfect reconstruction (NPR) MDFT FB. Per-

fect reconstruction (PR) condition on FB, which lead to zero error at the output,

may result in more complex FB than is actually required to meet the speciﬁca-

2

tions. Design and hardware complexity can be reduced by using NPR instead of

PR FB. Hence for many practical applications, FB satisfying the NPR property are

better choices as long as the distortions are within the limits speciﬁed by the appli-

cations (Bregovi´c & Saramäki, 2002). In NPR MDFT FB, the aliasing distortion

and amplitude distortion are very low (Fliege, 1993, 1994a; Sakthivel et al., 2014;

Sakthivel & Elias, 2015).

In many applications such as wireless communications and subband adaptive

ﬁltering , we need to design non-uniform ﬁlter banks (NUFB) (Griesbach et al.,

1999; Jun & Sijie, 2010; Li et al., 2006; Nongpiur & Shpak, 2012). NUFB, may

lead to better performances and reduced complexity. There are some works al-

ready available on the design of NUFB. In (Hoang & Vaidyanathan, 1989), a non-

uniform quadrature mirror FB is designed particularly for integer valued decima-

tion factors. In (Nayebi et al., 1993), a NUFB is designed directly by the time

domain analysis and in (Lee & Lee, 1995), a non-uniform CMFB is designed by

merging the adjacent channels. However, in CMFB, the individual ﬁlters do not

have linear phase. In this work, we introduce the design of a non-uniform NPR

MDFT FB which is obtained from a NPR uniform MDFT FB. All the desirable

characteristics of uniform MDFT FB such as linear phase of all constituent ﬁlters

and very low amplitude distortion and aliasing are retained in the proposed non-

uniform MDFT FB. Here every constituent non-uniform channel is obtained by

merging some of the appropriate adjacent ﬁlters in the uniform MDFT FB. Hence

all the preferred attributes of the uniform MDFT FB are safeguarded and the de-

sign procedures are similar to those of the uniform MDFT FB (Fliege, 1994a).

This design of non-uniform MDFT FB by merging adjacent channels is not pro-

posed in the literature so far.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives an introduction

of MDFT uniform FB. Section 3 proposes the design of non-uniform MDFT FB.

Section 4 gives the details of results and analysis. Section 5 concludes the paper.

2. MDFT uniform FB

In the structure of the DFT FB (Fliege, 1994b; Sakthivel et al., 2014), Hk(z)

and Fk(z) represent the analysis and synthesis ﬁlters respectively of an M-channel

FB and ↑ M and ↓ M represent interpolation and decimation by M respectively

as shown in Fig.1. Here, the analysis and synthesis ﬁlters are derived by complex

modulation from a linear phase ﬁnite impulse response (FIR) prototype ﬁlter H(z)

with a transition band from −π/M to π/M.

Since the prototype ﬁlter is band-limited to 2π/M, all the non-adjacent alias

components are removed.

If we consider only adjacent alias components, the

ˆX(z) =

From equation (4), we can understand that the reconstructed signal contains

alias components. There is no way in the structure of the DFT FB to compensate

for the alias signals. To overcome this disadvantage some modiﬁcations have been

done in the DFT FB, which result in the MDFT FB (Fliege, 1994a).

The MDFT FB can be derived from a complex modulated FB by decimating

the sampling rate with and without a delay of M/2 samples and using either the

real or the imaginary part, alternately, in the sub-bands as shown in Fig.2. (Fliege,

5

1994a). These modiﬁcations eliminate directly adjacent alias spectra which are

the main components of aliasing in the DFT FB. Non-adjacent alias terms can be

made small by selecting high stopband attenuation in the design of the prototype

ﬁlter. This will give NPR in MDFT FB.

If the prototype ﬁlter is designed as a linear phase ﬁlter, all the analysis and

synthesis ﬁlters of MDFT FB will have linear phase. Hence, the MDFT FB is free

from phase distortions. The power complementary property of adjacent channels

and the stop band attenuation depend on the prototype ﬁlter design. In the MDFT

FB, the amplitude distortion function is given as (Fliege, 1994b; P.P.Vaidyanathan,

All the analysis and synthesis ﬁlters of the MDFT FB are obtained from the

same prototype ﬁlter utilizing complex modulation. Hence the problem of de-

signing the MDFT FB decreases to the problem of designing a single prototype

ﬁlter.

3. Proposed Design of MDFT non-uniform FB

The non-uniform FB decompose the input signal into subbands of unequal
bandwidths. The structure of an ˜M channel non-uniform MDFT FB is shown in
Fig.3. A set of ˜M analysis ﬁlters ˜Hk(z), 0 ≤ k ≤ ˜M −1 decomposes the input signal
into ˜M subbands. A set of synthesis ﬁlters ˜Fk(z), 0 ≤ k ≤ ˜M − 1 combines the
˜M subband signals. The decimation ratios are not equal in all the subbands. The
˜M channel non-uniform design is obtained from the M-channel uniform MDFT

FB by merging adjacent channels. For maximally decimated FB, the decimation

˜M−1

factors should satisfy the conditionP
The non-uniform bands are obtained by merging the adjacent analysis and
synthesis ﬁlters. Consider the analysis ﬁlter ˜Hi(z), which is obtained by merging
pi adjacent analysis ﬁlters, as given below.

˜Hi(z) =

ni+pi−1

Hk(z),

where ni is the channel number and pi is the number of adjacent channels to

be combined.

The synthesis ﬁlter ˜Fi(z), is obtained in a similar way.

˜Fi(z) =

Fk(z),

i = 0, 1, ...... ˜M − 1

(9)

The ˜Hi(z) and ˜Fi(z), i = 0, 1, ...... ˜M−1, form a new set of analysis and synthesis
ﬁlters in the ˜M-channel non-uniform MDFT FB. The corresponding decimation
factor Mi, is given by Mi = M
pi

.

In order for such a non-uniform MDFT FB to become a valid FB, each analysis
˜Hi(e jω) | should have a band selection capability. For this we assume that
the prototype ﬁlter H(z) is originally designed to meet, in addition to bandlimit

(10)

Then we obtain the following property:
Property 1: The analysis ﬁlter ˜Hi(z) and the synthesis ﬁlter ˜Fi(z), i = 0, 1, ...... ˜M−

Proof: Here it is veriﬁed only for the analysis ﬁlters ˜Hi(z). Similarly it can be
proved for the synthesis ﬁlter ˜Fi(z). The condition can be written as (Lee & Lee,
1995)

ni +pi−1

| ˜Hi(e jω) |2 =

ni+pi−2

| Hk(e jω) |2

Xk=ni
Xk=ni
k(e jω)Hk+1(e jω)]

[Hk(e jω)H∗

+ H∗

+

k+1(e jω)

(11)

where H∗

k (e jω) is the conjugate complex of Hk(e jω) and H∗

k+1(e jω) is the conju-

gate complex of Hk+1(e jω).

The adjacent aliasing components in equation (11) are eliminated in MDFT

FB structure (Fliege, 1994a). Then the equation (11) can be written as

| ˜Hi(e jω) |2=

ni+pi−1

Xk=ni

| Hk(e j(ω−k 2π

M )) |2

(12)

Hence the analysis ﬁlter ˜Hi(z) meets the ﬂatness condition.
From equation (6), it is proved that all adjacent aliasing terms and all odd alias-

9

ing terms are compensated in uniform MDFT FB (Fliege, 1994a; Karp & Fliege,

1999). The remaining alias spectra are removed by an adequate high stopband

attenuation of the synthesis ﬁlter.

Property 2: A condition is derived to ﬁnd a channel which will lead to aliasing,

when it is merged with any combination of adjacent channels.

The derived design validity is veriﬁed using the alias cancellation among the

non-uniform analysis and synthesis ﬁlters, by giving a sinusoidal input to the ﬁlter

bank with all even values of M (Fliege, 1994a).

The channel number which leads to aliasing when merged with adjacent chan-

nels is experimentally obtained as aM.

aM = (

M − 2n + 2

2

) − 1

(13)

where M is the total number of channels and n is an integer derived as given

below.

If M = 10i + 4 or M = 10i + 6 for i = 0, 1, 2, 3..... , then

n = $ M + 1

5

%

(14)

If M = 10i + 8 or M = 10i + 10 or M = 10i + 12 for i = 0, 1, 2, 3..... , then

n = $ M + 2

5

%

(15)

M is always chosen as even, since a decimation of M/2 is required in the

structure of MDFT ﬁlter banks. The n value obtained from equation (14) or (15)

when substituted in equation (13) gives the channel number aM. For example,

for M=8, equation (15) is to be used to obtain the value of n as 2. Hence from

10

equation (13), aM is obtained as 2. This means the channel number 2 if merged

with any other adjacent channels will lead to aliasing. For any value of M, only

a single channel when merged with other adjacent channels results in aliasing.

Hence for M = 8, merging of channels 0 and 1, 3 and 4, 4 and 5, 5 and 6, 6 and

7, 3,4 and 5, 4,5 and 6, 5,6 and 7, 3,4,5 and 6, 4,5,6 and 7 and 3,4,5,6 and 7 is

possible without causing aliasing.

Property 3: The distortion function of a non-uniform MDFT FB is similar to

uniform MDFT FB.

The distortion function can be written as (Lee & Lee, 1995)

˜Tdist(z) =

1
M

˜M−1

Xi=0

ni+pi−1

Xk=ni

ni+pi−1

Xm=ni

Fk(z)Hm(z)

(16)

Due to the bandlimit condition of the prototype ﬁlter, only the adjacent terms

will remain in equation (16). Hence we can rewrite equation (16) as

˜M−1

ni+pi−1

Fk(z)Hk(z)

˜Tdist(z) =

1
M

+

Xk=ni
Xi=0
Xk=ni
Xi=0

˜M−1

1
M

ni+pi−2

(Fk(z)Hk+1(z) + Fk+1(z)Hk(z))

(17)

The adjacent aliasing terms are canceled within the MDFT FB (Fliege, 1994a)

and by inserting the equations (1) and (2) in (17), the second term in equation (17)

becomes zero. Hence equation (17) can be written as

˜Tdist(z) =

1
M

˜M−1

Xi=0

ni+pi−1

Xk=ni

Fk(z)Hk(z)

(18)

Therefore the distortion functions of uniform and non-uniform MDFT FB are

11

found to be same.

The ﬁrst property veriﬁes that associated adjacent analysis (or synthesis) ﬁl-

ters produce ﬁlter which meet the ﬂatness condition. Second property identiﬁes

conditions of aliasing in non-uniform MDFT FB. From this condition, we can

get the alias-free M-channel non-uniform ﬁlters. Third property conﬁrms that the

distortion function is the same as that of uniform MDFT FB.

In the MDFT FB, the linear phase prototype ﬁnite impulse response(FIR) ﬁl-

ter designed using Parks McClellan method, is complex modulated to derive all

the analysis and synthesis ﬁlters with linear phase. Based on the degree of overlap

between the adjacent ﬁlter responses, some amplitude distortion will occur. In this

paper, the passband and stopband edge frequencies are iteratively adjusted, with

ﬁxed transition width to satisfy the 3-dB condition (Kalathil & Elias, 2014).

Design Speciﬁcations:

Maximum pass-band ripple :0.004dB

Minimum stop-band attenuation :60dB

Pass-band edge frequency :0.0618π

Stop-band edge frequency :0.0634π

Number of channels :8

Initially an 8-channel uniform Modiﬁed DFT FB is designed using Parks Mc-

Clellan method. By appropriately merging the ﬁlters of 8 channel uniform MDFT

FB, the non-uniform FB are designed. The merging of channels is done for all pos-

sible and valid combinations of adjacent channels. To verify the adjacent channel

aliasing during merging of channels, a sinusoidal signal is given as input to the

MDFT FB and the output is veriﬁed for each combination of merging channels.

Fig. 4 shows the frequency response plots of the analysis ﬁlters of 8-channel

uniform , non-uniform 5-channel derived from 8-channel uniform MDFT FB and

non-uniform 4-channel derived from 8-channel uniform FB . The frequency re-

sponse plots of the analysis ﬁlters of 16-channel uniform , non-uniform 8-channel

derived from 16-channel uniform MDFT FB and non-uniform 6-channel derived

from 16-channel uniform MDFT FB are shown in Fig. 5. The input and output

spectrum of the non-uniform MDFT FB are shown in Fig. 6. Amplitude distor-

tion function plot for the 4 and 6-channel non-uniform MDFT FB is shown in

Fig. 7. Two illustrations are shown to ﬁnd the aliased channel for any number of

channels.

Illustration 1

If M=8, then it will come under the constraint M = 10i + 8. Here i = 0. Hence

equation (15) is to be used to obtain n.

5 k = 2

n = j M+2
then aM = ( M−2n+2
This shows that if channel 2 is merged with any combination of adjacent chan-

) − 1 = 2

2

nels it will lead to aliasing during merging.

Illustration 2

If M=14, M will come under the constraint M = 10i + 4; i = 1. Then n is

obtained from equation (14) as 3 and a14 = 4.

This shows that channel 4 and its combinations will give aliasing during merg-

ing.

4. Results and Discussion

Initially, for the given speciﬁcations, the prototype ﬁlter with linear phase

is designed for uniform MDFT FB. Using the uniform ﬁlters, the non-uniform

MDFT ﬁlters are designed by merging adjacent channels. The adjacent channels

to be merged are selected making use of equations (13), (14) and (15). All the sim-

ulations are performed on an Intel(R) core(TM) i5 processor operating at 2.4 GHz

ing of adjacent channels is already available (Kalathil & Elias, 2014; Lee & Lee,

1995). But in the non-uniform CMFB , the constituent ﬁlters do not have linear

phase even with a linear phase prototype ﬁlter. In the non-uniform MDFT FB

proposed in this paper, all the constituent ﬁlters have linear phase.

5. Conclusion

Non-uniform FB satisfying linear phase property for all the constituent ﬁlters,

are desirable in applications such as speech and image processing and in commu-

nication. The design of non-uniform MDFT FB derived from a uniform MDFT FB

by merging appropriate adjacent channels is proposed in this paper. The proposed

design of the non-uniform MDFT FB is checked utilizing the alias cancellation

among the channels, distortion and ﬂatness condition of the channels. An equa-

tion is derived to ﬁnd the condition to prevent aliasing. Since the structure of the

uniform MDFT FB is preserved in the non-uniform FB, the phase distortion is

zero and amplitude distortion is kept very small.
