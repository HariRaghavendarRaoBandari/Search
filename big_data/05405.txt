ABSTRACT

Aims. Observations of the molecular gas over scales of ∼0.5 to several kpc provide crucial information on how molecular gas moves
through galaxies, especially in mergers and interacting systems, where it ultimately reaches the galaxy center, accumulates and feeds
nuclear activity. To understand the processes involved in the gas transport is one of the important steps forward to understand galaxy
evolution.
Methods. 12CO and 13CO 1−0 high-sensitivity ALMA observations (∼4(cid:48)(cid:48) × 2(cid:48)(cid:48)) are used to assess the properties of the large-scale
molecular gas reservoir and its connection to the circumnuclear molecular ring in the merger NGC 1614. Speciﬁcally, the role of
excitation and abundances are studied in this context.
Results. The spatial distributions of the detected 12CO 1−0 and 13CO 1−0 emission show signiﬁcant diﬀerences. The 12CO is tracing
the large-scale molecular gas reservoir associated with a dust lane associated with infalling gas, and extends into the southern tidal
tails. The 13CO emission peaks at the connection between the dust lane and the circumnuclear molecular ring found in previous
observations and largely avoids the dust lane. A 12CO-to-13CO 1−0 intensity ratio map shows high values in the ring region (∼30)
typical for the centers of luminous galaxy mergers, and even more extreme values in the dust lanes (>45).
Conclusions. Isotopic abundance and molecular line intensity ratios draw a picture of the molecular gas in NGC 1614 where chem-
ically less processed gas is infalling from further out in the galaxy disk via the dust lanes in the form of diﬀuse (unbound, non-self
gravitating) molecular clouds. Density wave activity leads to the molecular gas transitioning from the diﬀuse to a self-gravitating
state. Once the molecular gas forms a disk structure in the gravitational well of the larger galaxy, the clouds coagulate into giant
molecular associations (GMAs) which migrate into the circumnuclear ring and form stars. This is consistent with the surprisingly
high 16O-to-18O abundance ratio in the starburst region (≥900).

1. Introduction

Minor mergers, close galaxy interactions where the partners
have an unequal mass ratio, constitute the majority of interacting
events in the Universe. The gas accretion and nuclear feeding
mechanisms of these mergers are diﬀerent from major mergers
(equal-mass interactions, e.g., Naab et al. 2009). Minor merg-
ers are important for our understanding of galaxy evolution.
In particular,
they provide insights into how high-redshift
spheroidal galaxies evolve into systems at low-redshift, such
as local elliptical galaxies, and the formation of galaxy bulges
(e.g., Naab et al. 2009; Weinzirl et al. 2009). In minor mergers,
gas introduced into the interacting system by the disturbing
companion can generally be found at
large radii from the
center of the merger remnant (Bournaud et al. 2005). Stellar
bars, causing gravitational torques to eﬀect the gas, and/or
tidal torques invoked by the disturbing companion may lead
to the transport of the molecular gas along the large-scale dust

lanes to the mergers center, with this material acting to fuel
both star formation and nuclear accretion (e.g., Simkin et al.
1980; Scoville et al. 1985; Jogee 2006; Weinzirl et al. 2009).
There the gas may form polar rings that can appear as dust
lanes when seen edge-on (e.g., Combes 1988; Shlosman et al.
1989). We have found evidence that gas is funneled along polar
rings (Aalto & Hüttemeister 2000; Aalto et al. 2010; König
et al. 2013, 2014). Tracing this gas is vital to understand the
underlying galaxy-evolution and star-formation mechanisms in
this class of mergers.

Spectral lines of molecular isotopomers (isotopic variants)
can be used to study the eﬀect of infall, enrichment and gas
physical conditions. Elevated line ratios between the 12C
and 13C variants of CO have, for example, been proposed
to indicate a replenishment of relatively unprocessed disk
gas (e.g., Casoli et al. 1992; Henkel & Mauersberger 1993;
Taniguchi et al. 1999). However, the ratio cannot be used to
infer values on 12C/13C without taking eﬀects of optical depth
and line excitation (temperature, line width) into account. For

example, 12CO/13CO line ratios may be low in quiescent disk
gas and higher in hot nuclear gas without a change in 12C/13C
abundances, or even with the opposite abundance gradient (e.g.,
Aalto et al. 1995, 1997; Davis et al. 2015). Dynamical eﬀects
are also found to have strong impact on the observed 12CO/13CO
line ratios (e.g., Tosaki et al. 2002; Meier & Turner 2004; Aalto
et al. 2010). In addition, issues of selective photo destruction
also need to be addressed (e.g., Aalto et al. 1995).

ACS F435W/F814W ﬁlter grey-scale image to facilitate a comparison
of the location and distribution of the emission with respect to the dust
lanes at the center of NGC 1614. This image of the 3 mm continuum
emission was created using uniform weighting, which resulted in a sen-
sitivity of 1σ =59.8 µJy beam−1. The contours start at 3σ and are spaced
in steps of 5σ. The cross marks the phase center of the observations,
placed at the center of the molecular gas ring. The beam (see also Ta-
ble 1) is shown in the lower right corner. North is up, east to the left.

To investigate the nature of the large scale molecular gas
of NGC 1614 we obtained high-sensitivity ALMA 12CO, 13CO
and C18O 1−0 data. We also detected CN 1−0 and CS 2−1.

In this paper we present the results of a study of the molecu-
lar gas in the nearby minor merger NGC 1614. Throughout the
paper, we are concerned with pure rotational transitions of the
observed molecules between upper state J(cid:48) = j and lower state
J = i that are labeled j− i. Sect. 2 describes the observations and
the data analysis, in Sect. 3 the results of the observations are
presented, and the discussion of their implications follows in
Sect. 4.

2. Observations, data reduction and analysis
NGC 1614 was observed with the the Atacama Large Millime-
ter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in band 3 (3 mm) as part of
Cycle 2 observations of project 2013.1.00991.S (PI: S. König).
Here we focus on the data obtained with the ALMA Compact
Array (ACA) and the ALMA main array in compact conﬁgu-

Isotopic variants of oxygen, 16O and 18O, are used to trace
enrichment by massive stars (e.g., Henkel & Mauersberger
1993; González-Alfonso et al. 2014; Falstad et al. 2015).

pc, L8−1000µm
∼4× 1011 L(cid:12), Sanders et al. 2003) is a minor merger that
shows intense nuclear activity and a complex morphology,
with a minor axis dust lane crossing the optical body close to
the nucleus. The presence of a circumnuclear ring (r ∼300 pc)
has been reported from diﬀerent
tracers, for example Paα
(Alonso-Herrero et al. 2001), PAH (Väisänen et al. 2012),
multiple transitions of CO at mm wavelengths (König et al.
2013; Sliwa et al. 2014; Xu et al. 2015), and in the radio
continuum (e.g., Olsson et al. 2010; König et al. 2013). Most
of the nuclear activity originates from a very young starburst
residing in the ring itself (6–7 Myr, Puxley & Brand 1999;
Kotilainen et al. 2001; Schwartz & Martin 2004) and an older
starburst at its center (> 10 Myr, Alonso-Herrero et al. 2001).
Two competing formation scenarios for the ring have been
proposed: a “wildﬁre”scenario (Alonso-Herrero et al. 2001)
where the ring is the result of an outwards propagating starburst,
or that the ring is formed at the location of a Lindblad resonance
and is fueled by gas moving in via the dust lanes onto the ring
(König et al. 2013).

A number of emission lines tracing diﬀerent physical
conditions are originating from the molecular gas in NGC 1614.
A considerable fraction of the total molecular gas resides in
the central dust lanes but is not involved in the nuclear activity
(12CO 1−0, Olsson et al. 2010; Sliwa et al. 2014; García-Burillo
et al. 2015). Further studies of the 12CO 1−0 have revealed the
presence of a molecular outﬂow in NGC 1614 (García-Burillo
et al. 2015).

In our previous high-resolution CO studies of NGC 1614 we
not only discovered molecular gas in the starburst ring traced
by CO 2−1, but also that the majority of the CO emission of
NGC 1614 is located in the dust lane and is apparently not star
forming. We suggested that the gas here may be infalling and in
a diﬀuse, unbound state.

ration. The ACA observations took place on 2014 June 16 and
30, the ALMA compact conﬁguration observations on 2014 De-
cember 4 and 5. The phase center of the observations was located
at α=04:34:00.02688 and δ=−08.34.44.5692 (J2000). Two tun-
ings were obtained centered at 113.5 GHz and 108.5 GHz, where
the redshifted frequencies of the 12CO 1−0 and 13CO 1−0 lines
are located. Other lines observed within the ALMA band are
C18O 1−0, CN 1−0 and CS 2−1. The 3 mm continuum was re-
constructed using line-free channels. We used four spectral win-
dows of 1.875 GHz bandwidth (∼5000 km s−1) each, with a ve-
locity resolution of ∼5 km s−1, after Hanning smoothing. During
the observations, diﬀerent sources were observed for calibration
purposes: Uranus as ﬂux calibrator, J0339-0146 as bandpass cal-
ibrator, and J0423-0120 as bandpass and phase calibrator. With
baseline lengths between 8.8 m and 49.0 m, the ACA data are
sensitive to scales smaller than ∼38(cid:48)(cid:48). The compact conﬁgura-
tion main array ALMA data are sensitive to scales smaller than
∼22(cid:48)(cid:48) (baselines: 15.0 m− 390 m).

For all emission lines, sets of visibilities from ACA and the
compact conﬁguration observations were combined by weight-
ing the individual data sets in the uv plane to guarantee a contin-
uous amplitude vs. uv-distance distribution. The combined data
set was then deconvolved subsequently using the “clean” task in
CASA, and individual data cubes were created for each observ-
able (continuum and emission lines). The resulting beam sizes
and sensitivities are shown in Table 1.

After calibration and imaging within CASA1 (McMullin
et al. 2007), both visibility sets were converted into FITS for-
mat and imported in the GILDAS/MAPPING2 for further analy-
sis. All integrated intensity maps in this paper are moment zero
maps. To obtain the 12CO-to-13CO 1−0 map in Fig. 6 we used
the integrated intensity maps of both emission line distributions
– no clipping was applied. The resulting maps were smoothed to
a common beam at 5(cid:48)(cid:48) × 5(cid:48)(cid:48) and then the ratio map was obtained
on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Only pixels with signal-to-noise ratios
equal or larger than 5 in the ratio map were taken into account
and are depicted in the resulting image.

3. Results

3.1. 3 mm continuum

The 3 mm continuum (Fig. 1) is centrally peaked at the nucleus
of NGC 1614. The total integrated ﬂux recovered from the area
enclosed by the the 3σ contours in the uniformly weighted map
is ∼12.9 mJy. The size and structure of the distribution however
show more extended features, too - the emission seems to be
elongated with a northeast-southwest direction similar to what
was observed for 12CO 1−0 previously (Olsson et al. 2010; Sliwa
et al. 2014). The continuum emission is clearly associated with
the bulk of the 12CO, but also with the dust lanes in the center
of NGC 1614. Previously published observations of the 1.3 mm
continuum (Wilson et al. 2008; König et al. 2013) show a more
compact distribution (∼6-7(cid:48)(cid:48)) of the emission, even with compa-
rable spatial resolution. This might be because the continuum at
higher frequencies is more associated with the gas in the molec-
ular ring (König et al. 2013) than the larger-scale molecular gas
reservoir (Olsson et al. 2010; Sliwa et al. 2014).

3.2. 12CO 1−0
The 12CO 1−0 emission in NGC 1614 is more extended than the
3 mm continuum emission. Aside from the diﬀerence in size,
the 12CO distribution also shows a signiﬁcantly diﬀerent struc-
ture compared to the 3 mm continuum (Fig. 2). Location and
general morphology are in agreement with the results of Ols-
son et al. (2010), Sliwa et al. (2014) and García-Burillo et al.
(2015): The gas distribution appears centrally peaked with a sig-
niﬁcant elongation along a northeast-southwest direction, asso-
ciated with the dust lanes in the center of NGC 1614. Olsson
et al. (2010) ﬁnd an extent of about 11(cid:48)(cid:48), Sliwa et al. (2014) about
14(cid:48)(cid:48), García-Burillo et al. (2015) about 12(cid:48)(cid:48). In our data the ex-
tension is roughly 25(cid:48)(cid:48) in the northeast-southwest direction. This
diﬀerence is due to the higher sensitivity and the integration of
short-spacing observations in our data set. Additionally, the dis-
tribution in Fig. 2 shows features in the molecular gas that were
previously unknown. The extension towards the south, for exam-
ple, consists of low-surface brightness gas that extends into the

tidal tails to the south-southwest of the main body of the galaxy.
Hints for the feature extending towards the southeast, continu-
ing the direction of the minor nuclear dust lane, can already be
detected in Sliwa et al. (2014) and García-Burillo et al. (2015).
Our higher-sensitivity, improved uv-coverage observations now
clearly conﬁrm their presence. The total integrated ﬂux enclosed
in the 3σ contours is ∼241 Jy km s−1, which is about a factor of
seven times more than in Olsson et al. (2010), and a factor of two
more than previously observed by Scoville et al. (1989), but still
less than found in single-dish observations (Scoville et al. 1989;
Sanders et al. 1991).
The spectrum of the 12CO 1−0 emission (Fig. 2a) shows
a double-peaked Gaussian with a FWHM line width of
∼250 km s−1. The peak ﬂux is at about 1.1 Jy.

3.3. 13CO 1−0
Fig. 3 shows the spectrum and integrated intensity distribution
of the 13CO 1−0 emission in NGC 1614. The emission line ap-
pears to be double peaked with its highest ﬂux being ∼0.04 Jy,
and an integrated ﬂux of ∼6.6 Jy km s−1 at a line width (FWHM)
of about 250 km s−1. The integrated intensity distribution shows
the 13CO 1−0 emission to be situated in an elongated structure
of roughly 12(cid:48)(cid:48) extending from the northeast of the nucleus of
NGC 1614 to the southwest of it. The peak of the distribution,
however, is located slightly northwest of the nucleus, where the
12CO 2−1 emission in the molecular ring connects to the dust
lane (Fig. A.1, König et al. 2013). A comparison with an Hub-
ble Space Telescope (HST) image (Fig. 3b) shows that the 13CO
emission appears to follow the main high brightness star form-
ing structures at the center of NGC 1614. The image furthermore
indicates that the extent of the 13CO emission does not cover the
complete extent of the western dust lane. Instead, it seems that
the bulk of the 13CO 1−0 emission is avoiding the dust lane, in
contrast to the 12CO 1−0 emission (see also Fig. A.2).

(Fig. 4a; peak ﬂux: ∼0.02 Jy,

3.4. CN 1−0, CS 2−1 & C18O 1−0
Other molecular emission lines contained in the observed band-
widths are CN 1−0, CS 2−1 and C18O 1−0.
The CN N=1−0 emission is located in a compact, unre-
solved distribution at the nucleus of NGC 1614 (Fig. 4bc). With
a peak ﬂux of ∼0.03 Jy and an integrated ﬂux of 7.2 Jy km s−1,
the J = 3/2−1/2 component is stronger than the J = 1/2−1/2
component
integrated ﬂux:
∼3.8 Jy km s−1). The total integrated ﬂux is ∼10.3 Jy km s−1. The
average FWHM line width amounts to ∼250 km s−1. (cid:82)CN, the
integrated line ratio between the CN N = 1−0 J = 3/2−1/2 and
J = 1/2−1/2 components, amounts to ∼2, which indicates that the
gas traced by the CN emission in NGC 1614 is optically thin.
The CS 2−1 emission is clearly detected in NGC 1614
(Fig. 5). Its spatial distribution is compact and centered on the
nucleus of the galaxy, following the main high brightness star
forming structures in the HST image (Fig. 5b). The peak ﬂux in
the spectrum is at 7.7 mJy. The integrated ﬂux is found to be
roughly 1.3 Jy km s−1, at a FWHM line width of ∼250 km s−1.
The C18O 1−0 emission line was not detected. An upper limit
at 3σ amounts to ∼0.1 Jy km s−1 within the central 4(cid:48)(cid:48) × 4(cid:48)(cid:48).

3.5. 12CO-to-13CO 1−0 line ratio
From a detailed comparison of the 12CO and 13CO 1−0 emission
distributions indicate an oﬀset in the emission peak location be-

Article number, page 4 of 10

tween the two tracers - the 12CO peaks right at the nucleus of
NGC 1614, whereas 13CO peaks slightly to the northwest of it
(an overlay image showing the central 14(cid:48)(cid:48) can be found in the
Appendix in Fig. A.2). Furthermore, the two emission distribu-
tions are distinctly diﬀerent in size and structure. Indeed, a 12CO-
to-13CO 1−0 ((cid:82)10) line ratio map (Fig. 6) shows compelling evi-
dence for this. The (cid:82)10 distribution shows an elongated structure
of constant value (∼30) that coincides with the location of the
minor axis dust lane close to the nucleus (Fig. 6b). Moving along
this direction towards the dust lane in the west of the nucleus,
(cid:82)10 increases to its maximum values of 40 to 45 at the outer
edge of the western dust lane, where the 13CO 1−0 is largely ab-
sent. Towards the northeastern, eastern and western edge of the
map, the distribution shows more normal values ((cid:82)10 = 10−15)
associated with the gas in the disk of starburst galaxies. Higher
resolution observations are necessary to exactly located the peak
in the (cid:82)10 distribution (König et al., in prep.).

4. Discussion

4.1. Line ratio variations

In Sect. 3.5 we report an overall high (cid:82)10, with increasing val-
ues towards the dust western lane. Studies have been published
in other nearby minor merger systems, for example the Medusa
merger (Aalto et al. 2010), which show similarly elevated (cid:82)10.
It was suggested that the elevated line ratios are the result of ef-
fects from either or both of: 1) changes in the physical conditions
in the gas, or 2) abundance eﬀects (e.g., Meier & Turner 2004;
Aalto et al. 2010). These eﬀects are discussed further below.

4.1.1. Excitation effects

4.1.1.1 Temperature

In the context of the discussion in this section, we assume that
the abundances of 12CO and 13CO are constant over the central
region of interest. High average gas temperatures, low average
gas densities, or exceptionally high velocity dispersions in the
molecular clouds could be responsible for elevated line ratios
(e.g., Aalto et al. 1995; Meier & Turner 2004). In NGC 1614, the
gas with the highest (cid:82)10 ratios is located in the dust lane, away
from the bulk of the ongoing star formation. These facts most
likely excludes the notion of high gas temperatures as the cause
of the elevated line ratio. An alternative mechanism to elevate
(cid:82)10, and the absence of star formation in the dust lane, could be
mechanical heating and shears caused by shocks. So far no indi-
cations for the presence of shocks in the dust lane in NGC 1614
have been found: 13CO 2−1 observations at comparable spatial
resolutions (Wilson et al. 2008) indicate an emission distribu-
tion not very diﬀerent from what we present for 13CO 1−0 in this
work. Assuming the elevated (cid:82)10 values are due to the presence
of high-density gas, we expect densities of about 3×103 cm−3
or more. The result would be that the 13CO 2−1 ﬂux is a fac-
tor of four or more higher than for 13CO 1−0. This would have
been picked up by the observations of Wilson et al. (2008). Thus,
the presence of high-density gas due to shocks can most likely
be ruled out as the determining factor for the high line ratios
in NGC 1614. Furthermore, observations of dense gas tracers
like HCN, HCO+ 4−3 and CO 6−5 (Imanishi & Nakanishi 2013;
Sliwa et al. 2014) have not yielded a detection of dense gas emis-
sion in the dust lane, their emission is solely found in the circum-
nuclear ring.

4.1.1.2 Density

However change in the gas density is a valid option to cause the
observed change in (cid:82)10 in NGC 1614 – a decrease in the gas
density may cause an increase in the line ratio: If the gas in the
dust lane is diﬀuse, i.e. in the form of non-selfgravitating clouds,
the lower critical density favors the emission of 12CO 1−0 pho-
tons - due to “radiative trapping” the 12CO line is still bright
at critical densities of ∼200-300 cm−3, where 13CO 1−0 is faint
(Meier & Turner 2004). Previous studies of nearby galaxies have
suggested that the presence of diﬀuse gas in the dust lane is due
to the funneling of gas along the same, thus gas infall is involved
(e.g., Aalto & Hüttemeister 2000). If the infalling gas is the only
eﬀect causing the increase of (cid:82)10, the abundance ratio over the
central region would need to be well mixed, i.e. should have val-
ues more corresponding to what is found for the inner Galac-
tic disk (Meier & Turner 2004). (cid:82)10 around 30 at the center of
NGC 1614 puts the line ratios for the molecular gas there ﬁrmly
above that (see also Sect. 3.5; e.g., Aalto et al. 1995; Meier &
Turner 2004; Aalto et al. 2010).

One possible candidate for a secondary line ratio enhance-
ment mechanism could be the presence of a density wave in
NGC 1614. The situation in M 51 seems to be a good analogy
for what we ﬁnd in NGC 1614. In M 51, Tosaki et al. (2002)
found high 12CO-to-13CO 1−0 ratios in the central and interarm
regions. Velocity dispersion observations led them to suggest the
presence of streaming motions. The authors thus proposed that
streaming motions, caused by density wave activity, led to the
accumulation of dense gas located in self-gravitating clouds, as
traced by 13CO 1−0, to be located downstream from the diﬀuse
gas that is traced by 12CO 1−0. This is exactly what we ﬁnd in
NGC 1614 – the (cid:82)10 is high in the dust lane where we sus-
pect the gas to be diﬀuse. Downstream of this gas, traced by
12CO 1−0, lies the peak of the 13CO 1−0 distribution. This is also
similar to what has been proposed for the Medusa merger (Aalto
et al. 2010).

4.1.2. Abundance effects

12C/13C

4.1.2.1
The 12CO-to-13CO 1−0 intensity line ratio map shows values of
about 30 towards the nucleus of NGC 1614 (see Sects. 3.5 and
4.1.1), which corresponds to line ratios found predominantly for
warm, turbulent, high pressure gas in the centers of luminous
merging galaxies (e.g., Aalto et al. 1995; Glenn & Hunter 2001).
From the discussion of the impact of excitation eﬀects on the line
ratios in Sect. 4.1.1, we conclude that the presence of diﬀuse gas
in the dust lane under the inﬂuence of density wave activity can
partially explain elevated values for (cid:82)10. To increase the 12CO-
to-13CO 1−0 to a level as we ﬁnd in NGC 1614 an additional
factor has to be taken into account to explain the enrichment of
13CO, that also causes the relative deﬁciency of C18O - the im-
pact of changing abundances.

Casoli et al. (1992) suggested that (cid:82)10 could change depend-
ing on the 12CO/13CO abundance ratio, [12CO]/[13CO], when
low metallicity gas was transported from the outskirts of a
merger to its center. The starburst would then contribute to en-
rich the infalling metal-poor gas in 13C (e.g., Rupke et al. 2008;
Henkel et al. 2010). We assume the 12CO 1−0 line transition to
be optically thick, that the 12CO and 13CO emission trace the
same gas and also that the excitation temperatures for the two
are comparable. This would mean that [12CO]/[13CO] would be
roughly 90, which is a typical value for gas further out in the

Galactic disk (e.g., Henkel et al. 1985; Wilson & Rood 1994;
Wouterloot & Brand 1996; Henkel et al. 2014), and thus points
to the presence of infalling, chemically less processed gas.

16O/18O

4.1.2.2
Using the C18O 1−0 integrated intensity upper limit
in the
central 4(cid:48)(cid:48) × 4(cid:48)(cid:48),
the 12C16O-to-12C18O 1−0 line ratio results
in a lower limit of ∼325. The resulting abundance ratio is
[12CO]/[C18O]∼900. Values found for the Galactic center are
∼250, for the solar neighborhood typical values are about 500
(e.g. Wilson & Matteucci 1992). Considering that this result for
NGC 1614 is only a lower limit to [12CO]/[C18O], and also tak-
ing the high 13CO-to-C18O 1−0 integrated intensity line ratio in
the central 4(cid:48)(cid:48) × 4(cid:48)(cid:48)into account (∼10.3), C18O 1−0 seems very
deﬁcient in comparison to 12CO 1−0, but especially with respect
to 13CO 1−0. C18O is thought to come from short-lived massive
stars early during a starburst event (e.g., Prantzos et al. 1996;
Meier & Turner 2004), whereas 13CO 1−0 is predicted to be pro-
duced later-on in intermediate-mass stars (e.g., Meier & Turner
2004, and references therein). An explanation for this deﬁciency
in the center of NGC 1614 could be that the mixing of the in-
falling, chemically unprocessed gas with the prevailing gas is
not eﬃcient. Although this could also be an eﬀect of the size of
the beam in the observations - if the unprocessed infalling gas
is located inside the same beam as the prevailing nuclear gas a
dilution of the separate signals could occur. This dilemma will
be solved by higher resolution observations of the same set of
molecular tracers. The results will be presented in a forthcoming
paper (König et al. 2016, in prep.).

Taking the ﬁndings in Sect. 4.1.1 and this section into ac-
count, we propose that the increase in the 12CO-to-13CO ratio
in NGC 1614 is actually caused by the presence of diﬀuse gas
in the dust lane and density wave activity, in combination with
enrichment of 13CO due to infalling metal-poor gas from further
out in the galactic disk. However, a deﬁnitive answer to whether
also a change in the temperature of the gas has an inﬂuence can
only be obtained together with sensitivity-matched observations
of the 12CO and 13CO 2−1 lines.

4.2. NGC 1614 - The big picture?
In this section, we now try to bring our results together with what
has been previously reported on what is going on in NGC 1614
– a cartoon representation of the proposed scenario is depicted
in Fig. 7.

In 2001, a starburst ring was discovered at the nucleus of
NGC 1614 by Alonso-Herrero et al.. Its presence was conﬁrmed
in a number of other tracers (e.g., Olsson et al. 2010; Väisänen
et al. 2012). Alonso-Herrero et al. (2001) suggested that the ring
was formed as the result of an outwards progressing starburst
event that has already consumed most of the gas at its center. The
ring also has a molecular component (König et al. 2013; Sliwa
et al. 2014; Xu et al. 2015). As a result, it was suggested the
ring is situated at the location of crowded orbits in the merger
potential where it is replenished by gas coming in via the dust
lane (König et al. 2013; Sliwa et al. 2014). The 12CO 1−0 (Ols-
son et al. 2010; Sliwa et al. 2014; García-Burillo et al. 2015),
2−1 (König et al. 2013) and 13CO 1−0 line transitions trace the
low-to-intermediate surface brightness gas that shows how the
starburst ring is connected to the large-scale molecular gas reser-
voir – diﬀuse gas in the form of unbound giant molecular clouds
(GMCs) could be funneled along the dust lane from the molec-
ular gas reservoir at larger scales (seen in 12CO 1−0) towards

the CO 2−1 gas reservoirs in more detail, thus allowing to collect
evidence in favor or against the competing scenarios proposed
for the formation of the circumnuclear ring.

4.2.1. Implications for high-redshift studies of mergers
We’d also like to stress that our results emphasise the need to
be cautious which tracers of the molecular gas to best use in
order to determine star formation capabilities, also for studies
at high redshifts. We have especially shown in this paper that
the 12CO 1−0 emission is not necessarily a tracer of the overall
content of the molecular gas that is capable to partake in star
formation because a large percentage of it might be in the form
of diﬀuse molecular gas. Additional observations at higher-J CO
transitions are necessary to be certain. Furthermore, C18O should
be used with caution to determine the age of the starburst activity
in galaxies with proven gas infall. The mixing of the infalling
gas with the prevailing gaseous materials might falsify the age
determination to a large degree.

5. Summary
In summary, with the ALMA observations presented here we
show that the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 1614 harbors large
reservoirs of molecular gas traced by 12CO and 13CO 1−0. The
12CO emission is widely distributed throughout the galaxy and
has a strong connection to the dust lanes, whereas the 13CO emis-
sion is much more compact and seems to avoid them. This possi-
bly hints towards the presence of non-selfgravitating, diﬀuse gas
in the dust lane that originates from further out in the galaxy disk.
The 13CO 1−0 emission distribution is likely a result of the eﬀect
of the progression of density waves on the galaxies molecular
medium. Aside from 12CO and 13CO 1−0 other molecular gas
tracers such as CN 1−0 and CS 2−1 are present in NGC 1614.
For C18O only an upper limit was found.

Fig. 7. Cartoon representation of the molecular gas structures in
NGC 1614. A large percentage of the 12CO 1−0 emission (hatched red)
is associated with the dust lane. The gas in the dust lane is in the form of
diﬀuse gas. The 13CO 1−0 emitting gas is not fully distributed through-
out the dust lane (hatched grey). Its emission peak (blue star) is lo-
cated in the “umbilical cord”, the connection between the molecular
gas in the circumnuclear ring, traced by 12CO 2−1 emission (crosshatch
pattern König et al. 2013), and the dust lane. The diﬀuse gas is be-
ing transported along the dust lane in the form of unbound molecular
clouds (GMCs). The interaction with density waves (red arrows) causes
the gas in the clouds to become self-gravitating. In the umbilical cord,
crowding processes in the merger potential occur and the GMCs form
GMAs through collisional coagulation. These larger associations are
then transported further onto the circumnuclear ring and star formation
may be triggered.

the nucleus. During this process, the gas may be hit by a den-
sity wave. The resulting shocks could cause the gas density to
increase and the molecular clouds to become self-gravitating (as
traced by 13CO 1−0). In this scenario, the molecular clouds are
trapped at the connection between the dust lane and the ring,
“the umbilical cord” (described by König et al. 2013), inside the
mergers potential through e.g., crowding processes. This could
lead to collisional coagulation of the GMCs into larger-sized
giant molecular associations (GMAs, traced by e.g. 12CO 2−1)
that then possibly migrate onto the circumnuclear ring. In this
way, the nuclear gas reservoir can be constantly replenished. The
cloud-cloud interactions could also trigger the onset of star for-
mation in the ring (Scoville et al. 1986; Tan 2000) - the high-
density gas, e.g., HCN and HCO+ (e.g., Imanishi & Nakanishi
2013; Sliwa et al. 2014; Xu et al. 2015), are exclusively associ-
ated with the star formation itself.

If the ring is indeed caused by a wildﬁre expanding into the
surrounding molecular medium, or is solely formed at the lo-
cation of the resonance in the mergers potential is still under
discussion. Solving this argument will require further studies:
Resolution and sensitivity matched 12CO and 13CO 2−1 obser-
vations will greatly improve our ability to determine whether the
presence of non-selfgravitating gas in the dust lane or a change
in the temperature of the gas is the cause of the extreme line
ratios in NGC 1614. Higher resolution 12CO 1−0 observations
at high sensitivity are needed to search for indicators of possi-
ble streaming motions between the large-scale and small-scale
molecular gas reservoirs to verify the funneling of gas along the
dust lanes towards the circumnuclear ring. They would also al-

a closer look at the detailed structure of NGC 1614. The ob-

side the dust lane to the west of the nucleus (white contours). Also, the
