uniaxial and cubic anisotropies from Monte Carlo simulations.

The low temperature behavior of densely packed interacting spherical single domain

nanoparticles (MNP) is investigated by Monte Carlo simulations in the framework of an

eﬀective one spin model. The particles are distributed through a hard sphere like distribu-

tion with periodic boundary conditions and interact through the dipole dipole interaction

(DDI) with an anisotropy energy including both cubic and uniaxial symmetry components.

The cubic component is shown to play a sizable role on the value of the blocking temperature

Tb only when the MNP easy axes are parallel to the cubic easy direction ([111] direction for

a negative cubic anisotropy constant). The nature of the collective low temperature state,

either ferromagnetic or spin glass like, is found to depend on the ratio of the anisotropy to

the dipolar energies characterizing partly the disorder in the system.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Magnetic nanoparticles still arouse a great interest both on the fundamental point of

view in nanomagnetism [1–5] and in the ﬁeld of applications especially in nanomedecine [6–

8]. Under a critical radius rsd depending on their chemical composition, determined by

the ratio of the energy necessary to sustain a domain wall to the magnetostatic energy,

magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) are single domain objects (see for instance [1, 9]). Typical

values for rsd are 15 nm for Fe, 35 nm for Co, 30 nm for γ-Fe2O3 [4, 9]. Under this
critical size, the simpliﬁcation due to the single domain character leads to the eﬀective

one spin (or macrospins) models where the MNP are represented as uniformly magnetized

particles. As a consequence, the anisotropy energy is to be understood as an eﬀective one,

since no direct reference to crystalline defects and to spin canting can be considered, and

includes contributions stemming from the MNP shape, crystalline anisotropy or surface

eﬀects. Although the local stucture of the MNP is then frozen, such eﬀective one spin

models (EOS) have shown to give results in agreement with experiments [10]. In most

cases the MNP are coated by a non magnetic layer making them exchange uncoupled. As a

result, the theoretical description of single domain magnetic nanoparticles assemblies faces

mainly two diﬃculties: the long range nature of the dipolar interactions and the one body

magneto-crystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). The former is at the origin of collective

behavior [4, 5] at low temperature while the later leads to irreversibility, namely the so-

called blocking phenomenon and hysteresis [9]. Both the inter-particle interactions and

2

the individual anisotropy inﬂuence the magnetic properties of the assemblies with diﬀerent

kind of signature, the former being essentially dependent on the underlying structure while

the later characterizes only the individual MNP. The importance of the dipole dipole

interactions (DDI), for a given value of the MNP moment, namely for a given material

and mean value of the diameter, is controlled by the inter-particle distances, via the

MNP concentration in the assembly. In addition, the nature of the state induced at low

temperature by the collective behavior resulting from the DDI depends strongly on the

underlying structure and dimensionality because of the anisotropic character of the dipolar

interaction.

It can be in principle ferromagnetic or anti–ferromagnetic for suﬃciently

ordered or concentrated systems [11–13], or spin–glass like (SSG) [5, 14, 15] for more

disordered ones as has been evidenced experimentally [16–20]. We emphasize that the

degree of structural disorder is of crucial importance on this point and that this latter

can be partly induced and/or modiﬁed by the MAE according to both its magnitude

and the corresponding easy axes distribution. On an other hand, the magnitude and the

symmetry of the anisotropy terms depend on the crystalline nature of the material, the

actual size, shape and surface characteristics of the MNP [4, 21]. It is worth mentioning

that the inﬂuence of both the DDI and the MAE on the magnetic properties are strongly

temperature dependent:

indeed, the MAE induced irresversibility behavior is expected

below the blocking temperature, while the inﬂuence of the MAE on the room temperature

magnetization curve is quite important only at suﬃciently large values of the applied

ﬁeld [22, 23]. Concerning the MAE an important issue is the interplay between cubic and

uniaxial symmetries [22–28]. This has been studied in detail essentially for assemblies of

non interacting [27, 28] or weakly interacting particles [22, 26]. In the strong DDI coupling,

corresponding to concentrated dried powders of MNP this topic has been addressed for

the magnetization curve at room temperature [23]. One of the motivations of Refs. [23,

27] was to examine the possibility to get evidence of a cubic component in the MAE

from an experimentally observable property, a goal motivated by the usual experimental

determination of the anisotropy constant from the blocking temperature once the MNP

size is known through a Stoner-Wohlfarth relaxation law. Following this procedure, one

assumes a priori a uniaxial symmetry for the MAE while a large fraction of works on

MNP refer to particles made of materials with cubic symmetry, as for instance the cubic

spinel ferrites. Then the uniaxial symmetry term can result from either the shape or

surface contribution [1] but nevertheless the bulk cubic contribution cannot be simply

ignored. Quite interestingly, Garanin and Kachkachi [29] and Kachkachi and Bonnet [30]

have shown that the surface anisotropy, when modeled from the N´eel surface anisotropy

model [31], can be represented by a cubic contribution to the total MAE leading to an

eﬀective one spin model which strengthens the usefulness of the combined symmetries

MAE study. In Refs. [32, 33] Monte Carlo simulations of magnetic properties including

3

the blocking temperature of thin ﬁlms composed of γ-Fe2O3 NP embedded in polyaniline
have been performed with NP interacting through DDI and characterized by two MAE

terms of uniaxial symmetry, stemming from shape and crystalline anisotropy respectively.

In the present work we focus on the eﬀect of combined anisotropies of uniaxial and cubic

symmetries. Conversely to the preceding paper, where the equilibrium magnetization was

concerned, we consider the blocking temperature as determined from the so-called ZFC/FC

curves. As in our previous work [23], we deal with concentrated systems with high dipolar

coupling and we deal only with MNP assemblies ﬁxed in position where the underlying

structure is determined from a hard sphere like distribution. A particular attention is paid

on the nature of the frozen orientational state reached at low temperature, and we show

the inﬂuence of the MAE induced disorder on this point.

II. MODEL

We model the assembly of spherical single domain MNP in the framework of macro

spin model. We neglect the size polydispersity and so consider an assembly of dipolar hard

spheres uniformly polarized with magnetization Ms and diameter d. The uniaxial and

cubic components of the magneto-crystalline anisotropy, described by the corresponding

single site interactions on the moment orientations, ˆmi (see equation (2)) are characterized

on the ﬁrst hand by the anisotropy constants Ku and Kc and on the other hand by the
uniaxial {ˆn}i and the cubic {ˆxα = 1,3}i easy axes respectively. The distance of closest
approach between MNP, say def f = d + ∆, may diﬀer from d due to a non magnetic

coating layer of thickness ∆/2 surrounding the MNP. We focus on an assembly of MNP

in a frozen disordered state. The structure of the assembly is modeled by a true hard
sphere conﬁguration, say R = {~ri}, obtained by a Monte Carlo evolution of hard sphere
particles starting from a face centered cubic (fcc) lattice at a ﬁxed density. The resulting

distribution is controlled through the radial distribution function ghs(r) and more precisely

the contact value, ghs(def f ), related the hard sphere ﬂuid pressure [34]. The hard sphere
system thus deﬁned is totally characterized by the volume fraction Φ = (π/6)ρd3
ef f where
ρ is the number of particles per unit volume. We also introduce the MNP volume fraction,
Φp = Φ(d/def f )3. The particles are then ﬁxed in position. Periodic boundary conditions
are used throughout the paper. The total energy of the system which includes the (DDI),

The long ranged dipolar interactions (DDI) are treated in the framework of the Ewald sum-

mation technique [35, 36] and the total expression including the latter can be found for in-

stance in Ref. [12]. In equations (2, 3) hatted letters represent unit vectors, r∗
ij = rij/def f
and v(d) = (π/6)d3 is the MNP volume. We also introduce the reduced temperature,

T ∗ = T /T0. Since we have in mind to model systems where no texturation is expected,
such as powders or random close packed samples, we consider the MNP as randomly

oriented one to each other. Accordingly the cubic contribution, a priori related to the

crystallographic orientations of the MNP’s considered as nano crytallites (NC), is char-
acterized by randomly distributed set of axes {ˆxα}i. On the other hand, as in Ref. [23]
the uniaxial easy axes are also randomly distributed but are either uncorrelated with or

ﬁxed to a given crystallographic orientation of the NC. In this later case, we consider the

situation of uniaxial and cubic contributions acting in a constructing way. With a nega-

tive cubic anisotropy constant used throughout this work, the usual case for cubic spinel

ferrites, this means uniaxial easy axes in the [111] direction of the NC. A similar situation

is obtained with kc > 0 and uniaxial easy axes parallel to one of the cubic easy axes,

namely ˆni = ˆxi (equivalently ˆyi or ˆzi).

The determination of the blocking temperature is performed from the so-called FC/ZFC

magnetization curves which we simulate from Monte Carlo runs including at each tem-
perature step 2.5 104 Monte Carlo steps (MCS) the last 1.25 104 of which are used to

perform the thermal averages. The ZFC curves are initiated from a true demagnetized
low temperature state, which is obtained from a long Monte Carlo run, up to 2 105 MCS

performed using a parallel tempering scheme [37] to overcome the expected slowing down

behavior due to the strong dipolar coupling regime as well as the deep MAE potential

wells. Each ZFC and FC magnetization curve is determined from the average on a set (up

to 48) of independent MC paths performed using either one or several diﬀerent structural

conﬁgurations (hard sphere distributions) This is is necessary in order to get an average

5

over disorder, see equation (5), due to both the random character of the easy axes distri-

bution and the underlying hard sphere like structure. This procedure is performed using a

parallel code where the paths are run simultaneously and the corresponding averages are

calculated as a ﬁnal step.

On an other hand, since we deal with concentrated system with a high dipolar coupling,

we expect the dipolar particles to present a collective state which may be of ferro mag-

netic or spin glass character. To discriminate from these possibilities we examine, at zero

external ﬁeld, the spontaneous magnetization and the nematic order parameter λ deﬁned

as the largest eigenvalue of the second rank tensor [38]

where ¯I is the unit tensor. This is done as usual by using the so-called conductive external
conditions which prevent the occurrence of demagnetizing eﬀect [12, 35]. Such external

conditions remain to consider the simulated system as immersed in an external medium

of inﬁnite permeability. For the simulation of the spontaneous magnetization, we also

use the parallel tempering scheme to avoid the important slowing down of the relaxation

in the system related to the occurrence of the frozen collective state. The spontaneous

magnetization < M > is determined from the average of thermal statistical mean values,

III. RESULTS

In this work we do not aim to simulate a speciﬁc experimental system; instead we focus

on the qualitative trend expected for typical magnetic MNP with iron oxides as a guide

for the choice of the physical parameters, because of their importance in the ﬁeld and

the representativity of their physical properties (Kc or Ms), in the family of oxide spinel

ferrites excepted CoFe2O4. Since these materials present a cubic structure, we estimate
the MAE uniaxial component from the shape anisotropy, assuming an aspect ratio of say
δ ≃ 1.10 to 1.20. Starting from µ0Ms = 0.5 T and Kc = -13 kJm−3 (-4.7 kJm−3), the
room temperature values of the cubic anisotropic constant for magnetite (maghemite),

and setting T0 to the room temperature we get a bare dipolar coupling constant ranging
from ǫ(0)
d = 1 to 8.0, |ǫc| ≃ 1.65 (0.60) to 8.10 (2.95) and ǫu ∼ 0.5 to ∼ 7.25 for MNP
with diameter in between d = 10 nm to 20 nm. This corresponds to the range of validity

of the macro spin models since they are limited to MNP whose radius is on the one hand
larger than some threshold value, say ∼ 2 nm [9], under which the majority of atoms

6

lie in the surface and on the other hand smaller than the single domain critical size rsd

recalled in the introduction. In the following the parameters retained for the simulations

are taken within the above ranges of values. We limit the DDI coupling to ǫd 6 2 which,

for instance, corresponds to include a coating layer ∆/2 = 2 nm on magnetite MNP of

d = 16 nm in diameter. Since we expect, from results obtained in the superparamagnetic
regime [23], that the cubic contribution leads to a sizable eﬀect only when |ǫc| > 3 ǫu at
least in the presence of DDI we limit our simulations to |ǫc| = 4 ǫu. All the simulations
are performed for a dense system characterized by Φ = 0.493 (φp ≃ 0.250 if we include
a coating layer ∆/2 ≃ d/8.0) with Np = 1728 particles in the simulation box.

Table I: Blocking temperature in terms of the coupling constants of the model.

Let us recall that the cubic axes ({ˆxα}i) are randomly distributed and we limit ourselves
to two diﬀerent situations: the uniaxial easy axes are either uncorrelated to the cubic ones

or are ﬁxed in the referential of the later in such a way to maximize the global anisotropy

eﬀect, namely coincide with the [111] direction of the local frame, ˆni = (Pα ˆxαi)/√3 for

ǫc < 0. This will be referred to in the following as random or [111] easy axes distributions

respectively, implicitly referring to the local referential of the MNP. According to our

preceding results, we expect comparable results for kc < 0 and ˆni = [111]i and for

kc > 0 with ˆni = ˆxi, considered in Ref. [28] for non interacting MNP.

The results obtained for the blocking temperature are given in table I and in ﬁgure (1).

First of all, we conﬁrm the well known increase of Tb with the DDI [40, 41]. The cor-

responding FC/ZFC curves are displayed in ﬁgures (2) and (3) in the absence of cubic

anisotropy for non interacting and interacting MNP, with ǫd = 1.0, respectively. The

plateau like behavior of the FC magnetization curve at T < Tb, known to result from the

7

collective behavior induced by the DDI is clearly seen. At the qualitative level, the FC

magnetization curves displayed in ﬁgure (3) are quite similar, the main diﬀerence being

the value taken by Tb; nevertheless we note that when the MAE coupling constant takes

a rather small value, ǫu = 0.60 and 1.40 for ǫd = 1 and 2 respectively, i.e. ǫu/ǫd 6 0.70,

the FC magnetization for T < Tb still increases slightly when T decreases, while for
higher values corresponding to ǫu/ǫd ≥ 1, the FC curves present ﬁrst a true plateau
with possibly a small dip. The latter behavior is known as the signature of a super spin

glass state [16, 17, 19, 42]. Therefore, we are lead to conclude that when the ratio ǫu/ǫd
increases beyond a threshold value ǫu/ǫd = ks ∼ 0.6, a super spin glass state is reached
at low temperature while, when ǫu/ǫd < ks the low temperature collective state may be

closer to a ferromagnetic state expected for ǫu = 0 at least in the monodisperse case and for

the high value of the volume fraction used here [14, 39]. Since the easy axes are randomly

distributed the ratio ǫu/ǫd measures the degree of disorder introduced in the system in ad-

dition to the structural one resulting from the hard sphere like MNP distribution and thus

is expected to bring the system from the ordered ferromagnetic phase to the disordered

super spin glass one. Although the precise determination of the nature of the collective

state at low temperature is beyond the scope of the present paper, we strengthen the above

interpretation from the calculation of the spontaneous magnetization and of the nematic

order parameter at zero ﬁeld, given by equation (4). The result is displayed in ﬁgure (4)

for ǫu/ǫd = 0, 0.6 and 1.0 in terms of the relevant variable (Φǫd/T ∗). The spontaneous

magnetization curves versus Φǫd/T ∗ in the cases ǫd = 1, ǫu = 0.6 and ǫd = 2, ǫu = 1.4 re-

spectively are very similar. We see that in the absence of anisotropy a clear ferromagnetic

phase is reached, while for ǫu/ǫd = 0.6, although the spontaneous magnetization does not

vanish, λ takes a quite small value and no clear jump is obtained conversely to the ǫu = 0

case. It is worth recalling that pure dipolar hard spheres (ǫu = ǫc = 0) located at the

nodes of a well ordered cfc lattice, present a ferromagnetic phase characterized by both
< M/Ms > → 1 and λ → 1 when T ∗ → 0 [12, 13] and, more precisely, to compare
with the results displayed in ﬁgure (4) we get < M/Ms > = 0.91 and λ = 0.75 for

(Φǫd/T ∗) = 4 [43]. The spontaneously magnetized phase at zero ﬁeld we get for ǫu = 0

is comparable to the disordered ferromagnetic phase obtained in [39] on a quite similar

system. We have checked from simulations with 864 or 2048 particles that in this later

case, < M > and λ depend only very weakly on the system size, which shows that we

are not dealing with a large but ﬁnite cluster ferromagnetically correlated. Then either
6= 0 both the spontaneous
for ǫu/ǫd > 0.7 with ǫc = 0 or in general ǫu 6= 0 and ǫc
magnetization and λ vanish.

The eﬀect of the MAE cubic contribution on Tb depends strongly on the relative orien-

tation of the uniaxial and cubic easy axes. When the uniaxial easy axes are uncorrelated to

the cubic ones, the deviation of Tb due to the cubic term is very small for MNP interacting

8

through DDI and is small but nevertheless signiﬁcant in the non interacting case, as can

be seen in table I and on ﬁgure 1 and 5. This is in agreement with what is found in the

on Tb both for non interacting and interacting MNP. The deviation (T ∗

superparamagnetic regime for the behavior of the magnetization curve in the intermediate
external ﬁeld range [23]. When the uniaxial easy axes {ˆn}i are set parallel to the [111]
direction of the local MNP frames, the cubic contribution to the MAE has a sizable eﬀect
b (ǫc) − Tb(0))
is then found nearly independent of ǫd which corresponds to a relative weakening of the
inﬂuence of ǫc when ǫd is increased. Indeed, still for {ˆn}i set parallel to the MNP [111]
direction, if we consider Tb in terms of the ratio |ǫc| /ǫu as is done in the non interacting
case by Correia et al. [28], we get from our simulations Tb(|ǫc| /ǫu = 4)/Tb(0) = 1.39,
1.26 and 1.14 for ǫd = 0, 1 and 2 respectively. Notice that the result for the latter ratio

in the non interacting case (ǫd = 0) is very close to what Correia et al. have obtained [28]

although the Tb values are not strictly comparable since Tb depend on the simulation ’time’

and moreover, Ref. [28] correspond to the easy axes in the [001] direction with ǫc > 0.

The behavior of Tb with respect to the cubic component in either the [111] or the random

uniaxial easy axes distribution, obtained in the present work (see Table I and Fig. 5), is

in agreement with that of the hysteresis curves calculated by Usov and Barandiar´an [27]

in the sense that we show that both a strong cubic to uniaxial energies ratio and conve-

niently correlated orientations of the two symmetries easy axes is necessary for the cubic

MAE contribution to signiﬁcantly inﬂuence Tb. The low temperature plateau of the FC

magnetization curve is much more marked when the MAE cubic contribution does not

vanish and especially for the [111] easy axes distribution. Moreover, at low temperature

(Φǫd/T ∗ > 4), both the spontaneous magnetization and the nematic order parameter
vanish when ǫc 6= 0.

Finally we compare the FC/ZFC and the resulting Tb in the pure uniaxial or cubic

cases with comparable individual barrier heights. This is done by noting that the uniaxial
MAE barrier height is ǫu while the cubic MAE one is given by −ǫc/12 with ǫc < 0 since
the moment must go through the saddle point in the [110] direction in order to jump from

one [111] potential well to an other one. Therefore we compare as an example the cases

(ǫu = 2, ǫc = 0) with (ǫu = 0, ǫc = -24) and (ǫu = 1.40, ǫc = 0) with (ǫu = 0, ǫc = -16.8)

for ǫd = 0 and 2 respectively where we get Tb = 0.22 and 0.29 on the ﬁrst hand and

Tb = 0.56 and 0.58 respectively. Only in the non interacting case the corresponding pure

cubic Tb values is signiﬁcantly larger than the pure uniaxial one, while a quasi coincidence
is obtained for ǫd 6= 0. This is in agreement with the relative weakening due to the DDI
of the ǫc contribution to Tb.

To conclude, in this work ﬁrst of all we conﬁrm at low temperature the results we

obtained on large spherical clusters in the superparamagnetic regime, concerning the in-

ﬂuence of the MAE cubic contribution. This contribution to the magnetization behavior

9

is signiﬁcant only when the MNP easy axis is locally ﬁxed to the relevant MNP local

orientation ([111] or [100] for ǫc < 0 or > 0 respectively) and the corresponding deviation

in Tb is found nearly independent of ǫd. We also characterize at least at the qualitative

level the nature of the frozen low temperature phase, which is found to present either a

ferromagnetic or a spin-glass character depending on the value taken by the ratio ǫu/ǫd

contributing to the degree of disorder in the system for randomly distributed easy axes.

Conversely to our preceding work we consider only periodic boundary conditions and a

true hard sphere distribution is used for the MNP structure with the limitation to the

monodisperse case.
