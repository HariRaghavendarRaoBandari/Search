Abstract

In this work we study the annealed Potts model coupled to two
dimensional causal triangulations with periodic boundary condition.
Using duality on a torus, we provide a relation between the free energy
of the Potts model coupled CTs and its dual. This duality relation
follows from the FK representation for the Potts model. In order to
determine a region where the critical curve for the model can be located
we use the duality relation and the high-temperature expansion. This
is done by outlining a region where the inﬁnite-volume Gibbs measure
exists and is unique and a region where the ﬁnite-volume Gibbs mea-
sure has no weak limit (in fact, does not exist if the volume is large
enough). We also provide lower and upper bounds for the inﬁnite-
volume free energy.

Introduction

Causal triangulation (CT), introduced by Ambjørn and Loll (see [11]), to-
gether with its predecessor a dynamical triangulation (DT), constitute at-
temps to provide a meaning to the formal expressions appearing in the path
integral quantisation of gravity (see [1], [22] for an overview). The idea is
to approximate the emerging geometries by CTs. As a result, we obtain
a discrete version of the path integral where continuum geometries are re-
placed by a sum over all possible triangulations, where each triangulation is
weighted by a Boltzmann factor e−µ|T|, with |T| standing for the size of the
triangulation and µ being the cosmological constant. Then, evaluation of
the partition function is reduced to a purely combinatorial problem that can
be solved utilizing the approach developed in the early work of Tutte [2, 3]
or techniques based on random matrix models (see, e.g., [4]) and bijections
to well-labelled trees (see [5, 6]).

Putting a spin system on the collection of all causal triangulations is
generally interpreted as a coupling gravity with matter, which makes it
interesting to study the q-state Potts model coupled to CTs from a physical
point of view. The clasical example of such model is the two-state Potts
model (Ising model) coupled to a CT introduced in [14]. For the Ising
model existence of Gibbs measures and phase transitions has been recently
proved (see [14], [15], [20], [25] and [28] for details). For the numerical
results for the 3-state Potts model coupled to CTs we refer the reader to
[16]. In this work we focus on the q-state Potts model coupled to CTs for
any q ≥ 2. Our main goal is to derive properties of the phase transition
for the model and the critical curve by deﬁning a region in the quadrant
of parameters β, µ > 0 where the inﬁnite-volume free energy has a limit,
which implies uniqueness of the Gibbs measure.
In adition, we prove in
Corollary 2 that the critical curve of the model is asymptotic if β is large
to 3
q for the
Potts model coupled on CTs, and C(q) = ln 2q for its dual. (see Figure 2).
In order to obtain these results we utilize the FK-Potts models, introduced
by Fortuin and Kasteleyn (see [21]). These representations were successfully
employed in order to obtain important results for Ising and Potts models on
the hypercubic lattice. Since this representation permits the use of geometric
properties of the triangulations, we utilize it to derive a duality relation for
the parameters of the model and asymptotic behavior of the critical curve.
In general, the FK-Potts model on a ﬁnite connected graph (not neces-
sarily planar) is a model of edges of the graphs, where each edge is either

√
2 β + ln 2, and C(q) + o(β2) if β is small, where C(q) = ln 2

2

closed or open. The probability of a given conﬁguration is proportional to

p#open edges(1 − p)#closed edgesq

#clusters

,

where p ∈ [0, 1] and the cluster-weight q ∈ (0,∞) are the parameters of
the model. For q ≥ 1, the model can be extended to an inﬁnite graph. In
this case the model exhibits a phase transition for some critical parameter
pc(q), which depends on the geometry of the graph. In the case of planar
graphs, there exits a relation between FK-Potts models on a graph and its
dual, with the same parameter q and appropriately related parameters p
and p∗ = p∗(p). For a detailed introduction to the FK-Potts model we refer
the reader to [27]. In the case of FK-Potts model deﬁned on a causal trian-
gulation t with periodic boundary condition (see Figure 1 for a geometric
representation), the partition function of the FK-Potts model on t cannot
be written exactly as a partition function of a FK-Potts model on its dual
t∗, however it will be suﬃcient in order to obtain a duality relation of the
parameters in the thermodynamic limit. This relation together with the
Edwars-Sokal coupling, using p = 1 − e−β, permits ﬁnd a relation between
the parameters (β, µ) of the Potts model coupled to CT and the parameters
(β∗, µ∗) of its dual for the inﬁnite-volume (thermodynamic limit).

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce notation
and give a summary of the main features of CTs. We also deﬁne the an-
nealed Potts model coupled to CTs, and we establish the main results of this
work, Theorem 1 and 2. In Section 3, we describe the FK-Potts model and
establish the technical Lemma 1 of duality that we will be used in next sec-
tions. Section 4 contains the proof of Theorem 1. This result will play a key
role in the proof of Theorem 2. Also, in Corollary 2 we provide asymptotic
behavior for the critical curve. In Section 5, utilizing the High-T expansion
for q-state Potts model, we prove Theorem 2. The paper concludes with
Section 6, where we compare our results with the properties obtained in [20]
and [14].

2 Notations and main results

In this section we ﬁrts introduce notation and give a summary of the causal
dynamical triangulation, q-state Potts model and we deﬁne the Potts model
coupled CTs. Finally, we give a short of the Edwards-Sokal coupling. We
refer to [19], [27], [20], for more details. We attempt at establishing regions
where the inﬁnite-volume free energy converges, yielding results on the con-

3

vergence and asymptotic properties of the partition function and the Gibbs
measure.

2.1 Two-dimensional Lorentzian models

We will work with rooted causal dynamic triangulations of the cylinder
CN = S × [0, N ], N = 1, 2, . . . , which have N bonds (strips) S × [j, j + 1].
Here S stands for a unit circle (see Figure 1 for a geometric representation
of a CT). Formally, a triangulation t of CN is called a rooted causal dynamic
triangulation (CTD) if the following conditions hold:

• each triangular face of t belongs to some strip S × [j, j + 1], j =
1, . . . , N −1, and has all vertices and exactly one edge on the boundary
(S × {j}) ∪ (S × {j + 1}) of the strip S × [j, j + 1];

• the number of edges on S×{j} should be ﬁnite for any j = 0, 1, . . . , N−
1: let nj = nj(t) be the number of edges on S ×{j}, then 1 ≤ nj < ∞
for all j = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1.

and have a root face, with the anti-clockwise ordering of its vertices (x, y, z),
where x and y lie in S × {0}.

The CTs arise naturally when physicists attempt to deﬁne a fundamen-
tal path integral in quantum gravity. See [1] for a review of the relevant
literatute. For a rigorous mathematical background of the model we refer
to [19]. Additional properties of CTs have been studied in [13].

A rooted CT t of CN is identiﬁed with a compatible sequence

t = (t(0), t(1), . . . , t(N − 1)),

where t(i) is a triangulation of the strip S × [i, i + 1]. The compatibility
means that

i = 0, . . . , N − 2.

nup(t(i + 1)) = ndo(t(i)),

(1)
Note that for any edge lying on the slice S × {i} belongs to exactly two
triangles: one up-triangle from t(i) and one down-triangle from t(i−1). This
provides the following relation: the number of triangles in the triangulation
t, denoted by n(t), is twice the total number of edges on the slices. More
precisely, remind that ni is the number of edges on slice S × {i}. Then, for
any i = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1,

n(t(i)) = nup(t(i)) + ndo(t(i)) = ni + ni+1.

In the usual physical approach to statistical models, the computation of
the partition function is the ﬁrts step towards a deep understanding of the
model, enabling for instance the computation of the free energy and study
phase transition of the model. Follow this approach, the computation of
the partition function for the case of pure CTs, was ﬁrst introduced and
computed in [11] (see also [19] for a mathematically rigorous account).

Since we are interested in the bulk behavior of Potts model coupled
to CTs, we will in the following for simplicity choose triangulations with
periodical spatial boundary conditions, i.e. the strip t(N − 1) is compatible
with t(0), and let LTN denote the set of causal triangulations on the cylinder
CN with this boundary condition, thus the partition function for rooted CTs
in the cylinder CN with periodical spatial boundary conditions and for the
value of the cosmological constant µ is given by

ZN (µ) =

.

Moreover, the periodical spatial boundary condition on the CTs permits

to write the partition function ZN (µ) in a trace-related form

(4)
This gives rise to a transfer matrix U = {u(n, n(cid:48))}n,n(cid:48)=1,2,... describing the
transition from one spatial strip to the next one. It is an inﬁnite matrix
with positive entries

u(n, n(cid:48)) =

e−µ(n+n(cid:48)).

Employing the N -strip partition function for pure CTs with periodical
boundary condition, deﬁned by the formula (3), we deﬁne the N -strip Gibbs
probability distribution for pure CTs

e−µn(t).

(6)

In 2001, the paper [19] computed the partition function of the model and
proved existence of a weak limit of the measures QN,µ for µ ≥ ln 2, using
transfer-matrix formalism and tree parametrization of Lorentzian triangu-
lations (CTs). The weak limit measure permits describe each triangulation
via a positive recurrent Markov chain in the subcritical case µ > ln 2, and as
the branching process with geometric oﬀspring distribution with parameter

tation of a CT with periodic spatial boundary condition.

(see [19] for more details).
The transfer-matrix formalism suggests that, as N → ∞, the partition
function is controlled by the largest eigenvalue Λ of the transfer matrix (5):

That heuristic result was proved in [20]. The following properties hold and
will be utilized to prove the main results.
Property 1. (Theorem 1 in [19]). For any µ > ln 2 the following relation
holds true:

lim
N→∞

ln ZN (µ) = ln Λ(µ).

(9)
Further, the N -strip Gibbs measure QN,µ converges weakly to a limiting
measure Qµ.
Property 2. (Proposition 5, [19]). For any µ < ln 2, the N -strip partition
function ZN (µ) for pure CTs exists only if

erty the authors utilize the transfer-matrix formalism and Krein-Rutman
theorem. Inequality (10) in Property 2 implies that if µ < ln 2, then there
exists N0 ∈ N such that ZN (µ) = ∞ if N > N0.

2.2 Potts model coupled to CT

Let t be a CT on the cylinder CN with periodic boundary condition. Each
triangulation t can be view as a graph t = (V (t), E(t)) embedded on a
torus. Potts spin systems are generalizations of the Ising model. Whereas
in Ising systems the spins on two diﬀerent values, in the q-state Potts model q
distinct values, represent by the elements of the set {1, . . . , q}, are allowed on
any vertex from the triangulation t. We consider the product sample space
Ω(t) = {1, . . . , q}V (t) and we consider a usual (ferromagnetic) q-state Potts
model energy, where two spins σ(t) and σ(t(cid:48)) interact if their supporting
vertices t, t(cid:48) are connected by an common edge; such vertices are called
nearest neighbors, and this property is reﬂected in the notation (cid:104)t, t(cid:48)(cid:105). Thus,
the Hamiltonian used for the q-state Potts model on t is given by

The partition function for the q-state Potts model on t is deﬁne by

h(σ) = −(cid:88)
(cid:88)

.

where the summation is over any conﬁgurations σ ∈ {1, . . . , q}V (t). Thus,
the q-state Potts measure on t is deﬁne as follows

Using the partition function for the q-state Potts model on a ﬁxed t, we
deﬁne the partition function for the annealed q-state Potts model coupled
to CTs, at inverse temperature β > 0 and cosmological constant µ, as follows

(16)

In general, the q-state Potts model can be deﬁned on a general lattice
G. Therefore, it is possible deﬁne the q-state Potts model on the dual
t∗ of the triangulation t (see next section for a formal deﬁnition of t∗).
The partition function for the q-state Potts model on t∗ will denote by
ZP (β∗, q, t∗). Finally, we deﬁne the partition function for the q-state Potts

2.3 Main results

In the present article, we prove the following duality relation.
Theorem 1. Let q ≥ 2. The free energy of the q-state Potts model coupled

(19)

Thus, equation (18) relates the free energy of the q-state Potts model
coupled to CTs with the free energy of its dual, and maps the high and low
temperature of the dual models onto each other. We will use the duality
relation of Theorem 1 and the high-temperature expansion for the q-state
Potts model for determine a region in the quadrant of parameters where the
critical curve for the q-state Potts model coupled CTs and its dual can be
located (see Figure 2).
Understanding by critical curve of the model the boundary of the do-
main of parameters β and µ (β∗ and µ∗ on its dual, respectively) where the
model exhibits subcritical behavior, this paper makes a rigorous derivation
of the subcriticality domain for an q-Potts model coupled to two-dimensional

show the region where the critical curve of the model should be located (gray
region), and this ﬁgure show that critical curve for the model is asymptotic
to 3

As a byproduct, the Theorem 2 serves to ﬁnd lower and upper bounds for
the inﬁnite-volume free energy. Moreover, in the case of 2-state Potts model
(Ising model), Theorem 2 extends earlier results from [25], [20] and improves
the numerical approximation of the curve in high temperature given in [14].
In aditional, this approach allows to get a better aproximation of the critical
curve and check the asymptotic behavior of the critical curve given in [14],
and it say that critical curve is asymptotic to 3
2 β + ln 2. Furthermore, we
show that the behavior for the matter of the free energy density in the
gravitational ensemble in the thermodynamic limit, suppose in [14] for the
numerical simulations, is true. In Theorem 2, we ﬁnd a lower and an upper
curve that converges fast to 3

2 β + ln 2.

3 FK-Potts model on causal triangulations

In this section we describe the FK-Potts model on causal triangulations,
and in the last subsection we compute inequalities which will be used in the
proof of the Theorem 1.

Figure 3: Geometric representation of a dual causal triangulation t∗ with
periodic spatial boundary condition.

3.1 Deﬁnition of the FK-Potts model

Now, we turn to the FK representation of the q-state Potts model. The
random cluster model was originally introduced by Fortuin and Kasteleyn
[21] and it can be understood as an alternative representation of the q-state
Potts model. This representation will be referred to as the FK representation
or FK-Potts model. We are interested in study FK-Potts model on CTs and
dual CTs, and ﬁnd a duality relation relation between the parameters of the
model on CTs and its dual in order to obtain information about the critical
curve.
In [20], [25], the model was deﬁned putting spins on any triangle
(faces), but it is equivalent to put spins on any vertex of the dual graph. In
this section we work with causal triangulations and its dual with periodic
boundary conditions, i.e., causal triangulations embedded in a torus T (see
Figure 1 (b)). In general, let G = (V, E) be a graph embedded in T, we
obtain its dual graph G∗ = (V ∗, E∗) as follows: we place a dual vertex
within each face of G. For each e ∈ E we place a dual e∗ = (cid:104)x∗, y∗(cid:105) joining
the two dual vertices lying in the two faces of G abutting e. Thus, V ∗
is in one-one correspondence with the set of faces of G, and E∗ is a one-
one correspondence with E. For each causal triangulation t, we denote by
t∗ its dual. Let t = (V (t), E(t)) be a causal triangulation with periodic
boundary condition, where V (t), E(t) denote the set of vertices and edges,
respectively. The state space for the FK-Potts model is the set Σ(t) =
{0, 1}E(t), containing conﬁgurations that allocate 0(cid:48)s and 1(cid:48)s to the edge

 qk(w),
 qk(w).

(22)

(23)

e = {i, j} ∈ E(t). For w ∈ Σ(t), we call an edge e open if w(e) = 1, and
closed if w(e) = 0. For w ∈ Σ(t), let η(w) = {e ∈ E(t) : w(e) = 1} denote
the set of open edges. Thus, each w ∈ Σ(t) splits V (t) into the disjoint
union of maximal connected components, which are called the open clusters
of Σ(t). We denote by k(w) the number of connected components (open
clusters) of the graph (V (t), η(w)), and note that k(w) includes a count
of isolated vertices. Two sites of t are said to be connected if one can be
reached from another via a chain of open bonds. The partition function of
the FK-Potts model on t with parameters p and q and periodic boundary
condition is deﬁned by

ZF K(p, q, t) =

(1 − p)1−w(e)pw(e)

Thus, the FK-Potts measure on t is deﬁne as follows

Φt

p,q(w) =

1

ZF K(p, q, t)

e∈E(t)

(1 − p)1−w(e)pw(e)

We will use a similarly notation for the FK-Potts model on dual triangulation
t∗. We denote by ZF K(p∗, q, t∗) and Φt∗
p∗,q the partition function and the
FK-Potts measure on t∗ with parameters p∗ and q, respectively.

3.2 Edwards-Sokal coupling

There are several ways to make the connection between the Potts and FK-
Potts model. The correspondence between the q-state Potts model and FK-
Potts model was established by Fortuin and Kasteleyn [21] (see also [23],
[27]). In a modern approach, these two models are related via a coupling,
i.e., coupled the two systems on a common probability space. This coupling
was introduced by Edwards-Sokal in [23].
Let t be a CT on the cylinder CN with periodic boundary condition. We
consider the product sample space Ω(t)×Σ(t) where Ω(t) = {1, 2, . . . , q}V (t)
and Σ(t) = {0, 1}E(t). The Edwards-Sokal measure Q on Ω(t) × Σ(t) is
deﬁne by

Q(σ, w) ∝ (cid:89)

(cid:8)(1 − p)δw(e),0 + pδw(e),1δσi,σj

(cid:9)

e={i,j}∈E(t)

Theorem 3 (Edwards-Sokal [23]). Let q ∈ {2, 3, . . .}. Let p ∈ (0, 1) and
t a CT with periodic boundary condition, and suppose that p = 1 − e−β.
If the conﬁguration w is distributed according to an FK-Potts measure with
parameters (p, q) on t, then σ is distributed according to a q-state Potts mea-
sure with inverse temperature β. Furthermore, the Edwards-Sokal measure
provides a coupling of µt

ZF K(p, q, t) = e−β|E(t)|ZP (β, q, t).

3.3 FK-Potts model coupled to CTs with periodic boundary

conditions

In this section we obtain a relation between the partition functions of FK-
Potts model on a triangulation t and its dual. This relation was studied by
Beﬀara and Duminil-Copin for the FK-Potts model on Z2 with free, wired
and periodic boundary condition (see [24]). We will view wich the dual of a
FK-Potts model deﬁned on a torus is an almost FK-Potts model, but it is
not very diﬀerent from one.
Let t and t∗ a CT with periodic boundary condition and its dual. Each
conﬁguration w ∈ Σ(t) = {0, 1}E(t) gives rise to a dual conﬁguration w∗ ∈
Σ(t∗) = {0, 1}E(t∗) given by w∗(e∗) = 1 − w(e). That is, e∗ is declared open
if and only if the corresponding bond e is closed. The new conﬁguration
w∗ is called the dual conﬁguration of w, and note that there exists an one-
one correspondence between Σ(t) and Σ(t∗). As in the Section 3, to each
conﬁguration w∗ there corresponds the set η(w∗) = {e∗ ∈ E(t∗) : w∗(e∗) =
1} of its open edges.
Now, we start of one FK-Potts model on t with parameters p and q,
and we will obtain two FK-Potts models on the dual triangulation t∗ with
parameters p∗ and q that limited the initial model.

Let o(w) (resp. c(w)) denote the number of open edges (resp. closed) of
w, k(w) the number of connected components of w, and f (w) the number

13

of faces delimited by w, i.e. the number of connected components of the
complement of the set of open bonds. Now, We will deﬁne an additional
parameters δ(w) which is associated with the topology of the surface where
the graph was embedded. Call a connected component of w a net if it con-
tains two non-contractible simple loops γ1, γ2 of diﬀerent homotopy classes,
and a cycle if it contain a non-contractible simple loops γ1 but is not a net.
These deﬁnitions were introduced in [24].
In aditional, notice that every
conﬁguration w can be of one three types:

• One of the cluster of w is a net. In that case, we let δ(w) = 2;
• One of the cluster of w is a cycle. We then let δ(w) = 1;
• None of the cluster of w is a net or a cycle. We let δ(w) = 0.

Utilizing the previous deﬁnition of the parameter δ, we obtained the follow-
ing version of Euler’s formula.

Proposition 1 (Euler’s formula). Let t a CT with periodic boundary con-
dition and w ∈ {0, 1}E(t). Then

|V (t)| − o(w) + f (w) = k(w) + 1 − δ(w).

(25)

Employing duality and Proposition 1, we have the following relations

o(w) + o(w∗) = |E(t)|,

(26)
Let q ∈ [2,∞) and p ∈ (0, 1). The partition function for the FK-Potts model
is given by

f (w) = k(w∗) and δ(w) + δ(w∗) = 2.

cluster of w in terms of its dual w∗

k(w) = |V (t)| − |E(t)| + o(w∗) + k(w∗) + 1 − δ(w∗).

14

Note also that o(w) + o(w∗) = |E(t)| = |E(t∗)|. Plugging before relations
into the partition function of the FK-Potts model, we obtain

As there exists an one-one correspondence between Σ(t) and Σ(t∗), in the
last equality we we change the sum over Σ(t) by the sum over Σ(t∗). Thus,
we obtain the following representation of the partition function in terms of
conﬁgurations into Σ(t∗)

Notice that −1 ≤ 1 − δ(w∗) ≤ 1, for any w∗ ∈ Σ(t∗). We denote by
ZF K(p∗, q, t∗), the partition function of a FK-Potts model with parameters
p∗ and q. Thus, we obtain the upper bound

ZF K(p, q, t) ≤

p|E(t)|

(1 − p∗)|E(t∗)| q|V (t)|−|E(t)|+1ZF K(p∗, q, t∗) ,

for the partition function of FK-Potts model on t with parameters p and q.
Using the one-one correspondence between E(t) and E(t∗), we conclude the
proof.

The partition function for pure CT’s has been determined as a sum
over all possible triangulations of a cylinder where each conﬁguration is
weighted by a Boltzmann factor e−µn(t), where n(t) standing for the size
of the triangulation and µ being the cosmological constant. Thus, into
two-dimensional quantum gravity the volume n(t) becomes an important
dynamical variable for the model. Therefore, we rewrite inequalities for the
partition function in Lemma 1 in terms of the dynamical variable n(t). In
the Table 1 we show the simple relation among V (t), E(t), V (t∗), E(t∗) and
the number of triangles n(t) of a CT t. Employing relations of Table 1, the

4 Proof of Theorem 1

In the previous section we have found comparison inequalities between the
partition function of the FK-Potts model on t and the partition function
of the FK-Potts model on its dual.
In this section, we employ results of
previous sections in order to prove Theorem 1. Combining inequalities (30),
(31) and the Edwars-Sokal coupling, we obtain the following comparison
inequalities between the partition function of the q-state Potts model on t
and the partition function of the q-state Potts model on its dual t∗.

Note that inequalities (32) and (33) are satisﬁed for any t ∈ LTN and
for any N ∈ N. Utilizing this observation we establish the following relation:
Let t, t∗ be a inﬁnite causal triangulation and its dual respectively, and
denoting by ψG(β) the free energy of the Potts model deﬁned on the graph
G = t, t∗. Then, we obtain the following result in the thermodynamic limit.

Multiplying by the Boltzmann factor e−µn(t) in equations (32) and (33),

5.1 Lower bound for the critical curve

Let t be a CT embedded in the torus with height N . We deﬁne the set Πi of
conﬁgurations in Σ(t) which splits V (t) in i maximal connected components,
i.e.

Πi = {w ∈ Σ(t) : k(w) = i}.
i the set of conﬁgurations in Σ(t∗) which splits V (t∗)

Similarly, we denote Π∗
in i maximal connected components.

Another way of writing ZP is as the moment generating function of the

number of clusters in a random graph as follow

Utilizing G = t, t∗, we write the representation (37) in terms of the
dynamical variable n(t) of the model. For that, we consider the two cases
of interest separately.

in terms of volume n(t) of the triangulation as follow

These lower bounds for the q-state Potts model on t permit to obtain a lower
barrier for the parameters where the annealed model could be deﬁned, and
the partition function of the model coupled to CTs could no explode in ﬁnite
volume. Apparently, the reader could think that crude bounds employed do
not give thermodynamics information of the model, but these bound are
sharp at high and low temperature, as we show in the proof of Theorem
2. Furthermore, these lower bounds serves in order to obtain information
about the Gibbs measure for q-state Potts model coupled to CTs.

whenever N > N0. Moreover, the Gibbs distribution Pβ,µ

by using the standard formula with ΞN (β, µ) as a normalising denominator,
consequently, there is no limiting probability measure Pβ,µ as N → ∞.
Proof. The lower bound in (39) for ZP (β, q, t) provide the following lower

by the duality relation established in Theorem 1 we obtain a region Σ∗
where the model coupled to dual CTs also cannot be deﬁned (see Table 2).
In the next section we will prove that this lower bound is sharp at low and
high temperature.

In this section we utilize a High-T expansion for the Potts model introduced
by Domb in [29], see also the review [31], [30].

Let t be a CT with periodic boundary condition. The partition function

for the Potts model on t is write in the usual high-T expansion as

ZP (β, q, t) =

where h = eβ − 1 and fij = h

q+h (−1 + qδσi,σj ). It can be readily veriﬁed that
σ fij = 0 for all {i, j} ∈ E(t), consequently, all subgraphs with one or
more vertices of degree 1 give rise to zero contributions. Thus, the partition
function can be written as follow

Proof of Theorem 2. Employing the inequality (45) and Table 1, we write
the bound (45) for the partition function of the Potts model on t in terms of
the number of triangles n(t). This inequality is true for any graph, therefore
similar computations serve for the dual model. We consider the two cases
of interest separately.

1. The model on CTs: In this case, we can to write the bound (45) for
the partition function in terms of volume n(t) of the triangulation as follow

In this section we only consider Ising model on dual causal triangulations
in order to compare our results with the previous results about the Ising
model coupled dual causal triangulations present in [20]. That early work
utilize the transfer matrix method in order to provide a curve µ∗ = ψ(β∗)
(blue line in Figure 5) that satisﬁes

This property is in concordance with our result because the critical curve
satisﬁed the same property, see Corollary 2. Now, we deﬁne the functions

the model, that is, ϕinf (β) ≤ γI

show numerical evidence that the model have a phase transition. Denoting
