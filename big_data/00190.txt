Abstract. Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) was used to investigate the static
and dynamic magnetic properties of carbon-doped Mn5Ge3 (C0.1 and C0.2) thin
ﬁlms grown on Ge(111). The temperature dependence of magnetic anisotropy
shows an increased perpendicular magneto-crystalline contribution at 80K with
an in-plane easy axis due to the large shape contribution. We ﬁnd that our
samples show a small FMR linewidth (corresponding to an intrinsic magnetic
damping parameter α=0.005), which is a measure of the spin relaxation and
directly related with the magnetic and structural quality of the material. In the
perpendicular-to-plane geometry, the FMR linewidth shows a minimum at around
200K for all the samples, which seems to be not correlated to the C-doping.

The magnetic relaxation parameters have been determined and indicate the two-
magnon scattering as the main extrinsic contribution. We observe a change in the
main contribution from scattering centres in Mn5Ge3C0.2 at low temperatures,
which could be related to the minimum in linewidth.

1. INTRODUCTION

The ﬁeld of semiconductor spintronics is rapidly de-
veloping nowadays. The idea to combine the well es-
tablished data processing capabilities of semiconductor
electronics with ferromagnetism may lead to new func-
tionalities and low power consumption of devices[1, 2].
One of the main obstacle for spin injection into a semi-
conductor is the conductivity mismatch at the interface
of the ferromagnetic metal and the semiconductor[3].
One way to avoid it is to use a thin insulating layer
acting as a tunnel barrier between the two materials.
Another approach is to design the spin injecting inter-
face with a similar structure and properties by alloying
or doping the semiconductor with a magnetic element.
The intermetallic magnetic Mn5Ge3 could pro-
vide the desired solution as it grows directly onto Ge
substrate[4], therefore being compatible with existing
semiconductor technology. Mn5Ge3 shows ferromag-
netism with a Curie temperature (Tc) around room
temperature[5] and an important spin polarization (up
to 42%)[6, 7]. The Mn5Ge3 hexagonal cell contains
10 Mn atoms which are arranged in two diﬀerent sub-
lattices (MnI and MnII ) due to diﬀerent coordina-
tion.
Inserting carbon atoms into interstitial voids
of MnII octahedra leads to an increase of Tc up to
450K, supplying a solution for the room temperature
spin injection[8]. Ab-initio calculations indicate that
the structural distortions have a small inﬂuence on the
increased Tc in Mn5Ge3Cx (the lattice is compressed
compared to pure Mn5Ge3), with the enhanced ferro-
magnetism attributed to a 90◦ ferromagnetic superex-
change mediated by carbon[9].

Several preparation methods were used to grow
Mn5Ge3 thin ﬁlms.
The most common growth
method is the solid phase epitaxy which consists
in the deposition of Mn or Mn and C on a
Ge(111) layer followed by an annealing leading to
the formation of the Mn5Ge3 or Mn5Ge3Cx ﬁlms.
Due to the low Mn solubility in Ge,
secondary
precipitates or Mn-rich regions/clusters frequently
appear inside the Mn5Ge3 ﬁlms. Mn atoms also
diﬀuse in the underlying Ge(111) substrate which
deteriorates the interface quality.
In this article,
we report on the structural and magnetic properties
of thin ﬁlms C-doped Mn5Ge3 epitaxially grown on
Ge(111) by reactive deposition epitaxy (RDE) at
room temperature.
The low growth temperature
reduces segregation and allows the formation of thin

ﬁlms of excellent crystalline quality suitable for the
determination of various magnetic parameters by
FMR: magnetic anisotropy, magnetisation and the g-
factor which were quantitatively determined and theirs
dependence on carbon content and temperature was
identiﬁed. From the study of the FMR linewidth,
the magnetic relaxation process is investigated and the
magnetic relaxation parameters are found. The main
relaxation channels we identify are the intrinsic Gilbert
damping and the two-magnon scattering. The intrinsic
magnetic damping measured by FMR determines the
time scale of the dissipation of magnetic energy into
the lattice. We determine that C-doped Mn5Ge3
has a very low damping of spin motions, with an
intrinsic Gilbert damping constant α between 0.005
and 0.01, which is one of the lowest known value
for ferromagnetic Mn-based thin-ﬁlm compounds. In
the two-magnon scattering process, the uniform FMR
mode (k=0) can scatter to degenerate non-uniform
modes (k6= 0) with an eﬀective interaction matrix
proportional to the Fourier transform of samples
inhomogeneities[10]. We observe that the role of
the scattering centres changes at low temperatures
in Mn5Ge3C0.2 where a superposition of twofold and
fourfold symmetry dominates and not the usual six-
fold as at room temperature. The ferromagnetic
resonance measurements demonstrate the very good
structural quality and the low magnetic damping in the
C-doped Mn5Ge3, paving the way for heterostructure
integration and spintronic applications.

2. Experimental details

The sample preparation as well as the reﬂection high-
energy electron diﬀraction (RHEED) measurements
were performed in a UHV setup with a base pressure of
2.7×10−8 Pa. Mn5Ge3Cx layers were grown epitaxially
on Ge(111) substrates[4, 11]. These substrates were
chemically cleaned before introduction in the UHV
chamber. Then we did a degassing of the Ge(111)
substrates by direct heating up to 720 K for 12 h and
ﬂashed afterwards at 1020 K to remove the native oxide
layer. After repeated ﬂashes at 1020 K and a cooling
down at 770 K, a 15 nm thick Ge buﬀer layer was
deposited on the Ge(111) substrates to make sure that
the starting surface of the Mn5Ge3Cx thin ﬁlms growth
is of good quality. The quality of this starting surface
was checked in-situ by RHEED. Eventually the sample
was cooled down to room temperature (RT).

To form the Mn5Ge3Cx layers we used the reactive
deposition epitaxy method[12]. Using this method the
Mn5Ge3Cx layers are created by phase nucleation at
the surface of the sample during the epitaxial growth.
No diﬀusion phenomenon is required for the growth
unlike the solid phase epitaxy process which is usually
employed to form the Mn5Ge3Cx ﬁlms on Ge(111).
However a good control of the diﬀerent ﬂows is needed
to match the stoichiometry of the desired compound :
Ge and Mn were evaporated using Knudsen cells and
C atomic ﬂow was obtained thanks to a high purity
pyrolytic graphite ﬁlament source (SUKO) from MBE-
Komponenten. The Ge and Mn ﬂows were calibrated
with a water-cooled quartz crystal microbalance and
the C ﬂow was calibrated using the structure transition
between the Si(001) (2×1) and c(4×4) reconstructions
which occurs for a C deposited thickness of 0.4 atomic
monolayer on Si(001) surfaces[13]. The growth of the
Mn5Ge3Cx ﬁlms was monitored in-situ by RHEED :
the Mn5Ge3Cx ﬁlms growing epitaxially on a Ge(111)
surface exhibit an easily identiﬁable RHEED (√3 ×
√3)R30◦ pattern which is characteristic of the Mn5Ge3
and Mn5Ge3Cx compounds[11, 14].

The saturation magnetisation and the estimated
Curie temperatures of all samples were determined
by SQUID measurements. A SQUID magnetometer
Quantum Design MPMSXL working in a temperature
range 1.8K to 300K and in a magnetic ﬁeld up
to 5T was used.
The FMR measurements were
performed with a conventional X-band (9.39GHz)
Bruker EMX spectrometer
in the 80K to 300K
temperature range. The samples (2 × 2mm2) were
glued on a quartz suprazil rode and mounted in the
centre of a rectangular cavity (TE102). To improve
the signal-to-noise ratio, the FMR measurements were
carried out using a modulation ﬁeld of 100kHz and 5Oe
amplitude with a lock-in detection. The FMR spectra
were measured with the applied magnetic ﬁeld rotated
in plane and out-of-plane. The FMR spectra were
ﬁtted to a Lorentzian proﬁle and the resonance ﬁeld
and FWHM linewidth were subsequently extracted.
Typical spectra at RT are shown in ﬁgure 1(a) for 12nm
thick ﬁlms. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of Mn5Ge3
at 300K (ﬁgure 1) is 38 which is the lowest SNR of all
measured spectra and is due to the proximity to Tc.
The SNRs for the other spectra of ﬁgure 1 are 115
and 250 for Mn5Ge3C0.2 and Mn5Ge3C0.1 respectively
which have higher Tc.

3. Model and geometry

The FMR spectra were analyzed with the Smit-Beljers
formalism for a thin ﬁlm with uniaxial (hexagonal)
symmetry[15]. For a ferromagnetic ﬁlm with hexagonal
symmetry,

where θH , ϕH are the polar and azimuthal angle of
the external ﬁeld with respect to the surface normal

the [100] direction, θ and ϕ are the polar and azimuthal
angle of the magnetisation with respect same directions

where Ψ =
as the magnetisation M is dragged behind H owing
to anisotropy. When M and H are parallel, this
contribution vanishes.
As generally the in-plane
and out-of-plane linewidth are not equal, extrinsic
contribution have to be taken into account. The
extrinsic contribution generally include the magnetic
relation due to magnon-magnon interaction, the two-
magnon interaction, which is given by[21, 22, 23, 24]:

∆H2mag =

(11)

with Γ the two-magnon scattering rate. The two-
magnon contribution usually vanishes for a critical out-
of-plane angle θ < 45◦. Short-range ﬂuctuations in
magnetic properties due to sample imperfections lead
to two-magnon scattering. Inhomogeneous broadening
eﬀects (superposition of
local resonances) due to
long-range ﬂuctuations of magnetic properties also
participate to the extrinsic linewidth, especially at
intermediate angles as the resonance local ﬁeld can
vary. We consider here three types of inhomogeneous
broadening: ∆Hmos, ∆Hint and ∆Hinhom. The ﬁrst
term is the mosaicity term due to the distribution of
easy axes directions[16, 20]:

∆βH

(12)

with βH = (θH , ϕH ). The second term represents the
inhomogeneity of the internal ﬁelds in the sample[18]:

∂Hr

∆Hmos =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
∂βH(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

∂Hr

∆Hint =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

∆(4πMef f )

(13)

Finally, the last term which can contribute to
the linewidth is a residual
frequency and angular
independent inhomogeneous linewidth that cannot be
put in other form and is also due to long-range
ﬂuctuations of magnetic properties.

The procedure used to determine the magnetic
parameters was as follows:
the anisotropy ﬁelds
were determined using the system of equations (5)-
(8) applied at high symmetry directions
(along
easy/hard axes)
together with the corresponding
measured resonance ﬁelds (ﬁxed frequency) at a ﬁxed
g-factor. Afterwards, the polar and azimuthal angular
dependence of the resonance ﬁeld was ﬁtted to the same
equations and the equilibrium condition of the free
energy allowing for a variable g-factor as parameter.
The iteration was repeated several times until a good
ﬁt was obtained. This analysis yields the g-factor, the
anisotropy constants and the magnetisation direction
θ. These values serve in the ﬁt of the angular variation
of the linewidth which allows the numerical evaluation
of α, Γ and the inhomogeneous contributions using (2)-
(13).

4.1. Magnetic anisotropy

The full

To determine the magnetic energy anisotropy (in
absolute units), FMR measurements were carried out
at a frequency of 9.4GHz. The FMR spectra were
recorded as a function of the polar and azimuthal
angles of the external magnetic ﬁeld at diﬀerent
temperatures.
The saturation magnetisation was
determined from SQUID measurements. In ﬁgure 2(d),
the temperature dependence of the magnetisation up
to 300K is shown for Mn5Ge3, Mn5Ge3C0.1 and
Mn5Ge3C0.2. The Curie temperature was estimated
from these curves using a mean-ﬁeld approximation
which gives a good approximation of the temperature
dependence of the magnetisation.
line
correspond to a ﬁt with the Brillouin function B1.5
(S=3/2) and the dotted line to a ﬁt with B1 (S=1) that
follows better the experimental points of Mn5Ge3C0.2.
The estimated values of Tc are 315K, 345K and 450K.
The error bars correspond to ±10K for Mn5Ge3 and
Mn5Ge3C0.1 as the experimental points cover a larger
temperature range and superpose closely with B1.5.
The experimental points for Mn5Ge3C0.2 cover only
a small part of the temperature range and the error
bars are estimated to be of ±30K.
The out-of-plane angular variation for the reso-
nance ﬁeld Hr is shown in ﬁgure 2(a)-(c) for Mn5Ge3,
Mn5Ge3C0.1 and Mn5Ge3C0.2 at room temperature.
The Hr(θH ) curves indicate an in-plane easy axis with
a minimum resonance ﬁeld of 1.6kOe, 2.3kOe and
2.7kOe for Mn5Ge3C0.2, Mn5Ge3C0.1 and Mn5Ge3 re-
spectively for ϕH = 0◦. The hard axis is perpen-
dicular to plane ([001] direction) and has the highest
Hr of 8.6kOe, 6kOe and 5kOe. The azimuthal angu-
lar dependence of the resonance ﬁeld for Mn5Ge3C0.2,
recorded also at 300K is shown in ﬁgure 2(e). The
sixfold (hexagonal) symmetry in the azimuthal angu-
lar dependence indicates that an in-plane hexagonal
anisotropy exists with one easy axis along the [100] di-
rection of the ﬁlm. The experimental FMR data of
out-of-plane and in-plane dependence of the resonance
ﬁeld can be well simulated with (2) and the anisotropy
ﬁelds can be extracted. The anisotropy constants can
be found in absolute units by using the sample mag-
netisation determined from SQUID measurements.

The resulting anisotropy constants are sum-
marised in Table 1 along with the g-factor at several
temperatures. The positive sign of K2 indicates that
this term favors an out-of-plane easy axis of magneti-
sation while the shape anisotropy dominates[25].
In
the very thin ﬁlm limit, K2 could overcome the shape
anisotropy resulting in an out-of-plane anisotropy axis.
The diﬀerent Ki have a diﬀerent temperature depen-
dence. For Mn5Ge3 and Mn5Ge3C0.1, the sixfold in-
plane symmetry is to low to be extracted, therefore
only the K2 and K4 constants were determined from

the angular measurements. K2 is positive for Mn5Ge3
and C-doped Mn5Ge3 at all temperatures and increases
at low temperature. K4 decreases (increases in abso-
lute values) for Mn5Ge3, but for the C-doped com-
pounds has a minimum or a maximum at an inter-
mediate temperature. The sixfold in-plane anisotropy
in Mn5Ge3C0.2 increases at 250K from the room tem-
perature value, while at lower temperature becomes to
small or a transition to a fourfold in-plane anisotropy
arises as will be inferred from the linewidth temper-
ature dependence discussed in the next section. The
error bars for the anisotropy constants presented in
Table 1 are around 5%, which come from the com-
putation of M from SQUID measurements due to the
uncertainty in the volume of our samples.

The g-factor can be estimated from the angular
dependence of the resonance ﬁeld. Its value indicates
the inﬂuence of the orbital contribution to the total
magnetic moment. The ratio of the orbital to the
spin magnetic moment can be inferred from the Kittel
formula and is equal to the deviation of the g-factor
from the free electron value. The value of the g-
factor for Mn5Ge3 and Mn5Ge3C0.1 is 2.0005, while
for Mn5Ge3C0.2 this value increases to 2.0291 meaning
an increased orbital contribution with carbon doping
(1.5% of the spin magnetic moment).

4.2. Magnetic relaxation

The linewidth of the resonant signal ∆Hr is directly
related to the magnetic and structural quality of
the ﬁlms and provide information about the diﬀerent
relaxation channels in magnetic damping. In ﬁgure 3,
the temperature dependence of the FMR linewidth
is shown for the perpendicular to plane direction
(θH = 0◦) for Mn5Ge3 and C-doped Mn5Ge3. A
shallow minimum is observed for all three compounds
around 200K and a sharp peak close to Tc. At
lower temperature, the FMR linewidth increases and
saturates for Mn5Ge3 (measured to 6K). The minimum
in the linewidth seems not related with the C-
doping. It occurs around the same absolute value of
temperature and could be related with a small in-
plane transition to a fourfold anisotropy from sixfold
anisotropy (tetragonal distortion) or to a constriction
by the substrate.
linewidth at
low temperature was explained as an inhomogeneous
broadening due to the increase of the anisotropy
constants (K2) with decreasing temperature[17]. The
error bars for the measured FMR linewidth are less
than 2% in all cases.

The increase of

corresponding to the largest interval between M and
H. From the theoretical ﬁts of the data (solid lines)
obtained using (2)-(13), the relaxation parameters are
extracted and listed in Table 2.

For all compounds, the perpendicular to plane
linewidth is always smaller than the in-plane one
indicating the presence of two-magnon scattering
and other extrinsic contributions in the samples.
The intrinsic damping alone cannot explain the
out-of-plane shape of the ∆Hr(θH ) dependence as
observed in ﬁgure 4, where the two-magnon and
intrinsic Gilbert contribution are shown individually
for comparison. The respective values of the two
contributions are further compared in Table 2 by
computing the Gilbert damping parameter G and the
two-magnon scattering contribution γΓ2mag in s−1.
The contribution of the intrinsic linewidth (Gilbert)
to the total linewidth varies between 7% and 33%.
The mosaicity contribution is low for all cases and its
angular dependence induces the V-shaped form around
θH =0◦. A typical mosaicity contribution is shown in
ﬁgure 4 for Mn5Ge3C0.1 at 200K. The inhomogeneity
of the internal ﬁeld gives mainly a low contribution

angles. Our ﬁlms have an in-plane easy axis at all
temperatures, therefore the magnetisation lags behind
the applied ﬁeld when the ﬁeld is rotated out of the
plane. The peak in the linewidth occurs for θH between
20◦ at room temperature and 10◦ at low temperature,

with temperature in a large range of temperatures[26,
27]. Two diﬀerent mechanisms contribute to the
temperature dependence[10], one conductivity-like and
one resistivity-like with a transition between the two
at intermediate temperature. Sometimes these two
contributions have an equal inﬂuence on the damping.
Other models predict an anisotropic tensorial damping
constant ˆα[28] and its proportionality to 1/M[29],
leading to a strong variation close to Tc.

the

curves

We estimated the value of α for each compound
by ﬁtting the out-of-plane angular dependence of
∆Hr at a temperature corresponding to the minimum
of
in ﬁgure 3 (around 200K). For
this speciﬁc temperature, the estimation corresponds
to the maximum possible value of α considering
small inhomogeneous broadening (∆Hint and ∆Hinh).
Although we consider a constant α, as it is observed
from Table 2, at room and low temperature the
linewidth (and correspondingly the inhomogeneous
residual ﬁeld) increases for Mn5Ge3C0.1 which could
be explained by an increase of α at least at low
temperature. The room temperature increasing in the
linewidth is usually explained as a breakdown of the
uniform precession due to thermal excitations (spin-
waves)[30]. The increasing of the linewidth at low
temperature is smaller for Mn5Ge3 and Mn5Ge3C0.2
in the 100-300K temperature range being compatible
with a constant α as considered for this temperature
range.

The second relaxation mode that inﬂuence the
FMR linewidth is the two magnon scattering. The
uniform mode can couple with degenerate spin-wave
modes due to ﬂuctuations in the local eﬀective ﬁeld
that can arise from surface defects, scattering centres,
ﬂuctuation in the anisotropy from grain to grain
or other inhomogeneities[21, 23]. The two magnon
scattering rate Γ depends on the angle θH (out-of-
plane geometry) and on the resonance ﬁeld Hres. A
detailed analysis based on the eﬀect of the defects on
the response functions of thin ﬁlms was performed in
[22] and [31] for the case when the magnetisation is
tipped out-of-plane. We consider here the same type
of angular dependence of Γ as in [31] (see (8)). Γ
depends on the nature and shape of the defects that
activate the scattering mechanism. The values for
the Mn5Ge3 compounds, extracted from the ﬁtting
of the linewidth curves, are shown in Table 2 as a
function of temperature. From the calculated value
Γ2mag=8HKb2p/πD, the exchange spin-wave stiﬀness
D can be inferred if details of the defects are known
such as the covered fraction of the surface p or the
eﬀective height b (HK the anisotropy ﬁeld). Atomic
force microscopy measurements were performed on
the samples, from which the rms surface roughness
was determined:

contribution is shown in ﬁgure 4 at 100K.

considered temperature range (100K-300K). We prefer
using the dimensionless parameter α which varies
between 0.005 and 0.01 over the Gilbert damping
parameter G given by α=G/γM as the latter will
imply a strong temperature dependence.
The
Gilbert damping represents the decay of magnetisation
by direct viscous dissipation to the
lattice as
it
introduced in the Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert
equation[19]. The spin-orbit coupling is assumed to be
at the origin of spin-lattice relaxation in ferromagnets.
Ab-initio calculations

coupling explicitly show a weak dependence of α

was about 1.5-2nm, while for Mn5Ge3Cx it was close
to 1nm. Therefore, at room temperature, the spin-
wave stiﬀness was estimated as 0.12×10−8G cm2
for Mn5Ge3, 0.16×10−8G cm2 for Mn5Ge3C0.1 and
0.39×10−8G cm2 for Mn5Ge3C0.2 considering a defect
ratio of 50%. These values are only estimates as a
precise identiﬁcation of the defects is diﬃcult to obtain.
As observed from Table 2, the other extrinsic
contributions to the linewidth have only a small impact
on the ﬁtted curves. The mosaicity is very small,
inferior to 0.1◦, being a testimony of the good quality
of our samples. Also the inhomogeneity of the internal
ﬁelds is almost negligible in the majority of cases,
only for Mn5Ge3C0.1 at room temperature it seems to
have a larger inﬂuence. The higher values of Hint are
needed to explain the small peak observed around θH
= 0◦ for both Mn5Ge3 and Mn5Ge3C0.1 and for the
increase of the linewidth at intermediate angles until
θH = 90◦ for Mn5Ge3C0.1 at room temperature. The
values of the residual inhomogeneous contribution are
generally small, the larger values can also be attributed
to a temperature dependent intrinsic contribution as
discussed above.

We now discuss the case of Mn5Ge3C0.2, for which
both out-of-plane and in-plane data were ﬁtted, as
shown in ﬁgure 5. The panel (a) show the out-of-
plane dependence of the FMR linewidth. The 300K
and 250K data are well ﬁtted close to θH = 0◦ and at
larger angles but not at the peaks that correspond to
the largest interval between M and H (critical angle).
The dashed line at T=300K corresponds to a ﬁt with
the parameters indicated in Table 2 and ∆θH = 0.05◦,
while the full line to a ﬁt with ∆θH = 0.2◦. Although
increasing the mosaicity contribution ﬁts better the
peaks, the ﬁtted curve becomes V-shaped between the
peaks in total contradiction with the data. We believe
that the mosaicity is small (0.05◦) and the discrepancy
at the critical angle at 300K is due to some other eﬀect
(the FMR line being strongly distorted at this angle).
We also tried to ﬁt the 300K curve introducing in-plane
second and fourth order anisotropy constants (K2k and
K4k) without a better result (not shown). The low
temperature curves are nicely ﬁtted with the presented
model for all angles.

For the in-plane dependence of ∆Hr, the only
contributions that were considered were from the
isotropic intrinsic damping and the two-magnon
contribution which was expressed as follows[21, 20, 31]:

with ω0 = γMef f and Γif (ϕi) characterise the

(14)

for

anisotropy of the two-magnon scattering along diﬀerent
crystallographic in-plane directions. At 300K and
250K (ﬁgure 5(b)), the FMR linewith has the same
six-fold symmetry as the angular dependence of Hr
(ﬁgure 2(e)).
If the scattering centres are given
by lattice defects (dislocation lines), the azimuthal
dependence should reﬂect the lattice symmetry[32, 20].
The angular dependence of the scattering was ﬁtted
with Γif (ϕi) = Γ0 + Γ2 cos2(ϕ − ϕ2) + Γ6 cos 6(ϕ −
ϕ6) at 250K and 300K and with Γif (ϕi) = Γ0 +
Γ2 cos2(ϕ − ϕ2) + Γ4 cos 4(ϕ − ϕ4) at 150K and 100K.
The parameters Γ2 and Γ4 are phenomenologically
introduced to account
the observed angular
variation. Γ6 is expected from the sixfold symmetry.
The in-plane anisotropies are very small as observed
form their values in Table 1, therefore ϕM ≈ ϕH
and the dragging function is very close to unity and
neglected. A change of symmetry of the scattering
(or of the dominant contribution to the scattering)
seems to take place around 200K corresponding to
the minimum in ﬁgure 3. At lower temperature
a superposition of twofold and fourfold symmetry
dominates the angular dependence of the in-plane
linewidth. This can be related to the shape and
orientation of the defects (rectangular) that cause the
two-magnon scattering[21, 32, 33]. The two-magnon
scattering intensity depends on the direction of the
magnetisation in respect to the symmetry axes of
the magnetic defects and on the angle between the
magnetisation and the crystallographic axes. One can
think that the twofold and fourthfold symmetry can be
related to the magnetic symmetry of the defects and to
the lattice defect symmetry at low temperature with
the defects oriented mostly along the [110] direction.
This is also consistent with the increase in the two-
magnon scattering rate (see Table 2 and Table 3) at
lower temperature and with the variation in the two-
magnon linewidth contribution to the total linewidth
(from around 30% at 300K to 66% at 100K).

5. Conclusion

12nm thick Mn5Ge3 and Mn5Ge3Cx ﬁlms were grown
by reactive deposition epitaxy on Ge(111) substrates.
Detailed FMR measurements were performed on the
samples at diﬀerent temperatures. Both Mn5Ge3
and C-doped Mn5Ge3 show perpendicular uniaxial
magneto-crystalline anisotropy and an in-plane easy
axis of magnetisation due to the large shape anisotropy.
Doping with carbon increases the anisotropy ﬁelds
without diminishing the quality of the sample as
demonstrated by the small FMR linewidth of the ﬁlms.
From the angular dependence of the resonance ﬁeld
and of the linewidth, the anisotropy ﬁelds, g-factor
and magnetic relaxation parameters are obtained. The

contributions to the broadening of the FMR linewidth
come primarily from the intrinsic Gilbert damping
and two-magnon scattering.
In the temperature
dependence of the out-of-plane linewidth a very shallow
and wide minimum is observed close to 200 ± 40K. One
can suppose that this minimum and the changing of the
dominating contribution in the two-magnon scattering
from centres with diﬀerent symmetry are connected
one to each other. Nevertheless this supposition
requires additional evidences.
