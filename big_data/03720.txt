UNEXPECTED BIASES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF CONSECUTIVE

PRIMES

ROBERT J. LEMKE OLIVER AND KANNAN SOUNDARARAJAN

Abstract. While the sequence of primes is very well distributed in the reduced residue
classes (mod q), the distribution of pairs of consecutive primes among the permissible φ(q)2
pairs of reduced residue classes (mod q) is surprisingly erratic. This paper proposes a
conjectural explanation for this phenomenon, based on the Hardy-Littlewood conjectures.
The conjectures are then compared to numerical data, and the observed ﬁt is very good.

1. Introduction

The prime number theorem in arithmetic progressions shows that the sequence of primes
is equidistributed among the reduced residue classes (mod q). If the Generalized Riemann
Hypothesis is true, then this holds in the more precise form

π(x; q, a) =

li(x)
φ(q)

+ O(x1/2+ǫ), where li(x) := Z x

2

dt
log t

,

and π(x; q, a) denotes the number of primes up to x lying in the reduced residue class
a (mod q). Nevertheless it was noticed by Chebyshev that certain residue classes seem to be
slightly preferred: for example, among the ﬁrst million primes, we ﬁnd that

π(x0; 3, 1) = 499,829

and

π(x0; 3, 2) = 500,170,

π(x0) = 106.

Chebyshev’s bias is beautifully explained by the work of Rubinstein and Sarnak [15] (see
[7] for a survey of related work) who showed (in a certain sense and under some natural
conjectures) that π(x; 3, 2) > π(x; 3, 1) for 99.9% of all positive x.

What happens if we consider the patterns of residues (mod q) among strings of consecutive
primes? Let pn denote the sequence of primes in ascending order. Let r ≥ 1 be an integer,
and let a = (a1, a2, . . . , ar) denote an r-tuple of reduced residue classes (mod q). Deﬁne

π(x; q, a) := #{pn ≤ x : pn+i−1 ≡ ai (mod q) for each 1 ≤ i ≤ r},

which counts the number of occurrences of the pattern a (mod q) among r consecutive
primes the least of which is below x. When r ≥ 2, little is known about the distribution
of such patterns among the primes. When r = 2 and φ(q) = 2 (thus q = 3, 4, or 6),
Knapowski and Tur´an [9] observed that all the four possible patterns of length 2 appear
inﬁnitely many times. The main signiﬁcant result in this direction is due to D. Shiu [16]
who established that for any q ≥ 3, a reduced residue class a (mod q), and any r ≥ 2, the
pattern (a, a, . . . , a) occurs inﬁnitely often. Recent progress in sieve theory has led to a new
proof of Shiu’s result (see [2]), and moreover in this particular situation Maynard [11] has
shown that π(x; q, (a, . . . , a)) ≫ π(x).

Despite the lack of understanding of π(x; q, a), any model based on the randomness of the
primes would suggest strongly that every permissible pattern of r consecutive primes appears
roughly equally often: that is, if a is an r-tuple of reduced residue classes (mod q), then

π(x; q, a) ∼ π(x)/φ(q)r. However, a look at the data might shake that belief! For example,
among the ﬁrst million primes (for convenience restricting to those greater than 3) we ﬁnd

π(x0; 3, (1, 1)) = 215,873, π(x0; 3, (1, 2)) = 283,957,
π(x0; 3, (2, 1)) = 283,957, π(x0; 3, (2, 2)) = 216,213.

These numbers show substantial deviations from the expectation that all four quantities
should be roughly 250,000. Further, Chebyshev’s bias (mod 3) might have suggested a
slight preference for the pattern (2, 2) over the other possibilities, and this is clearly not the
case.

The discrepancy observed above persists for larger x, and also exists for other moduli
q. For example, among the ﬁrst hundred million primes modulo 10, there is substantial
deviation from the prediction that each of the 16 pairs (a, b) should have about 6.25 million
occurrences. Speciﬁcally, with π(x0) = 108, we ﬁnd the following.

a b π(x0; 10, (a, b))

Apart from the fact that the entries vary dramatically (much more than in Chebyshev’s
bias), the key feature to be observed in this data is that the diagonal classes (a, a) occur
signiﬁcantly less often than the non-diagonal classes. Chebyshev’s bias (mod 10) states that
the residue classes 3 and 7 (mod 10) very often contain slightly more primes than the residue
classes 1 and 9 (mod 10), but curiously in our data the patterns (3, 3) and (7, 7) appear less
frequently than (1, 1) and (9, 9); this suggests again that a diﬀerent phenomenon is at play
here.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a heuristic, based on the Hardy-Littlewood prime
k-tuples conjecture, which explains the biases seen above. We are led to conjecture that
while the primes counted by π(x; q, a) do have density 1/φ(q)r in the limit, there are large
secondary terms in the asymptotic formula which create biases toward and against certain
patterns. The dominant factor in this bias is determined by the number of i for which
ai+1 ≡ ai (mod q), but there are also lower order terms that do not have an easy description.

Conjecture 1.1. With notation as above, we have

li(x)

π(x; q, a) =

In general, the quantity c2(q; a) seems complicated, but there are some situations where it
simpliﬁes. For example, if a = (a, a) for a reduced residue class a (mod q), then regardless
of the choice of a we have

(1.1)

c2(q; (a, a)) =

φ(q) log(q/2π) + log 2π

.

We can also show that c2(q; (a, b)) = c2(q; (−b, −a)) for any two reduced residue classes a and
b (mod q). Moreover, while c2(q; (a, b)) seems involved, the symmetric quantity c2(q; (a, b))+
c2(q; (b, a)) simpliﬁes nicely: for distinct reduced residue classes a, b (mod q) we have

(1.2)

c2(q; (a, b)) + c2(q; (b, a)) = log(2π) − φ(q)

Λ(q/(q, b − a))
φ(q/(q, b − a))

,

where Λ denotes the von Mangoldt function. In particular, this expression depends only on
the diﬀerence b − a.

Conjecture 1.2. If a and b are distinct reduced residue classes (mod q), then π(x; q, (a, b))+
π(x; q, (b, a)) equals

li(x)

φ(q)2(cid:16)1 +

We give two other amusing consequences of Conjecture 1.1. The famous biases π(x) <
li(x), or π(x; 3, 1) < π(x; 3, 2), or π(x; 4, 1) < π(x; 4, −1) are known to be false inﬁnitely
often. However we conjecture that the robust biases in pairs of consecutive primes (mod 3)
or (mod 4) may hold always and from the very start!

Conjecture 1.3. Let q = 3 or 4, and let a be either 1 (mod q) or −1 (mod q). Then for all
x ≥ 5, we have π(x; q, (a, −a)) > π(x; q, (a, a)). Indeed for large x we have

π(x; 3, (a, −a)) − π(x; 3, (a, a)) ∼

and

π(x; 4, (a, −a)) − π(x; 4, (a, a)) ∼

Given a prime q, the product of two consecutive primes prefers to be a quadratic non-

residue rather than a quadratic residue.

Conjecture 1.4. Let q be a ﬁxed odd prime. For large x we have

Xpn≤x(cid:16) pn

In the direction of these Conjectures, the earliest work we found is the paper of Knapowski
and Tur´an [9] who “guess” that the events pn ≡ a (mod 4) and pn+1 ≡ b (mod 4) for the
four possibilities of a and b are “not equally probable.” However Knapowski and Tur´an go on
to suggest that π(x; 4, (1, 1)) = o(π(x)), which is now deﬁnitively false by Maynard’s work

[11]. The paper [9] was published after the death of both authors, and perhaps they had
something else in mind, maybe along the lines of our Conjecture 1.3 above? More recently,
in Ko [10] numerical results observing the biases in the distribution of consecutive primes
for small moduli are given. The paper by Ash, Beltis, Gross and Sinnott [1] again observes
these biases in pairs of consecutive primes, and initiates an attempt towards understanding
them based on the Hardy-Littlewood conjectures. The heuristic expression in [1] is a large
sum of singular series, and as the authors note, it is unclear from that expression whether
π(x; q, (a, b)) tends to π(x)/φ(q)2 for large x.

The process which leads to Conjecture 1.1 suggests that there are symmetries between the
various π(x; q, a). In particular, if we deﬁne aopp = (−ar, −ar−1, . . . , −a1), then we expect
that π(x; q, a)−π(x; q, aopp) = O(x1/2+ǫ). For pairs of consecutive primes, this “anti-diagonal
symmetry” was noted in [1]. For example, we ﬁnd that π(1011; 7, (1, 6, 3)) = 24,344,117 and
π(1011; 7, (4, 1, 6)) = 24,349,025. For reference, the nearest number of occurrences of another
pattern is for (6, 2, 1), with π(1011; 7, (6, 2, 1)) = 24,570,765.

In Conjecture 1.1 we expect that the remainder term O(cid:0)(log x)−7/4(cid:1) is given by a sum

involving the zeros of Dirichlet L-functions (mod q). The main terms given in Conjecture
1.1 are the same for all repeating patterns (a, a, . . . , a); nevertheless numerically one observes
some deviations in the counts of such patterns, and we expect the lower order ﬂuctuations
to account for these deviations.
In addition to the contributions from zeros, which we
expect to be oscillating, there also appear to be non-oscillating lower order terms of size
(log log x/ log x)2, which may play a bigger role for the computable ranges of x. We hope to
understand these lower order terms in future work.

An initial guess for why there is a bias against the repeating patterns might be that, after
a prime occurs that is a (mod q), all other classes have a chance to represent a prime before
a occurs again. However, a straightforward application of the Selberg sieve shows that the
number of primes for which pn+1 − pn < q is O(x/ log2 x), which is of a smaller order of
magnitude than the bias predicted by Conjecture 1.1.

Though we do not pursue this here, it should be possible to prove unconditional analogues
of Conjecture 1.1 in other settings, for example to numbers free of small prime factors or for
squarefree integers (in the latter case, the biases will be manifested already at the level of
the constant in the main term). We also mention two other settings in which large biases
are seen: the distribution of prime geodesics for compact hyperbolic surfaces into various
homology classes (see the discussion at the end of [15]), and the recent work of Dummit,
Granville, and Kisilevsky [3] concerning the distribution of numbers that are products of two
primes.

2. The heuristic for r = 2

In this section we develop a heuristic explanation of Conjecture 1.1 in the case r = 2. The
heuristic (like several other conjectures about the primes, see for example [4, 6, 13, 14, 8]) is
based upon the Hardy-Littlewood prime k-tuples conjecture. We begin by reviewing quickly

the Hardy-Littlewood conjectures and some related results, before proceeding to develop an
analog suitable for understanding π(x; q, a).
The Hardy-Littlewood conjectures. Let H be a ﬁnite subset of Z and let 1P denote
the characteristic function of the primes. In a strong form, the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture
asserts that

Xn≤x Yh∈H

dy

(log y)|H|

+ O(x1/2+ǫ),

1P(n + h) = S(H)Z x

where the singular series S(H) is given by

S(H) = Yp (cid:16)1 −

#(H mod p)

p

(cid:17)(cid:16)1 −

1

p(cid:17)−|H|.

In our calculations, it will be important to understand the behavior of the singular series
“on average.” Here Gallagher [4] established that for any k ≥ 1 and as h → ∞,

(2.1)

S(H) ∼ (cid:18)h

k(cid:19) ∼

hk
k!

,

XH⊆[1,h]

|H|=k

so that the singular series is 1 on average. A reﬁned version of this asymptotic was established
by Montgomery and Soundararajan [13], who introduced the modiﬁed singular series

S0(H) = XT ⊂H

(−1)|H\T |S(T ),

so that

S(H) = XT ⊂H

S0(T ),

with S(∅) = S0(∅) = 1. The modiﬁed singular series S0 arises naturally in the following
version of the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture (thinking of the elements of H as being small in
comparison to x):

Xn≤x Yh∈H(cid:16)1P(n + h) −

1

log n(cid:17) = S0(H)Z x

2

dy

(log y)|H|

+ O(x1/2+ǫ),

and the term 1/ log n that is subtracted above arises naturally as the probability that the
“random number” n + h is prime. Montgomery and Soundararajan showed that

(2.2)

S0(H) =

µk
k!

XH⊆[1,h]

|H|=k

(−h log h + Ah)k/2 + Ok(hk/2−1/(7k)+ǫ),

where µk is the k-th moment of the standard Gaussian (in particular, µk = 0 if k is odd)
and A is a constant independent of k. This reﬁnes Gallagher’s asymptotic (2.1), and shows
that S0(H) exhibits roughly square-root cancelation in each variable.
Modiﬁed Hardy-Littlewood conjectures. We need a slight modiﬁcation of the Hardy-
Littlewood conjecture, taking into account congruence conditions (mod q). For any integer
q ≥ 1 and a ﬁnite subset H of the integers, we deﬁne the singular series at the primes away
from q by

Sq(H) := Yp∤q (cid:16)1 −

#(H mod p)

(cid:17)(cid:16)1 −

(2.4)

q

n≡a (mod q)

where the term q/(φ(q) log n) being subtracted arises naturally as the probability that n + h
is prime, conditioned on the fact that n + h is coprime to q.
First steps towards the Conjecture. Let a and b be two reduced residue classes (mod q),
and let h be a positive integer with h ≡ b − a (mod q). We now formulate a conjecture for
the number of primes n ≤ x with n ≡ a (mod q) and such that the next prime after n
is n + h. The gaps between consecutive primes are conjectured to be distributed like a
Poisson process with mean ∼ log x (and Gallagher showed that this follows from the Hardy-
Littlewood conjectures), and so h should be thought of as a parameter on the scale of log x.
With this in mind, we are interested in

Write also 1P(n) = q/(φ(q) log n) + ˜1P(n) and similarly for 1P(n + h), and then expand
out the product in (2.5): thus we arrive at (ignoring the small diﬀerences between log n,
log(n + h) or log(n + t))

UNEXPECTED BIASES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF CONSECUTIVE PRIMES

Appealing now to the conjectured relation (2.4), we are led to hypothesize that the quantity
in (2.5) (and (2.6)) is
(2.9)

(−1)|T |Sq,0(A ∪ T )(cid:16) 1

(t+a,q)=1∀t∈T

Before proceeding further, a few points are in order. Note that α(x)hφ(q)/q is about e−h/ log x,
and this exponential decay in h is in keeping with the conjecture that gaps between consec-
utive primes are distributed like a Poisson process. Secondly, by replacing A and T above
with h−A and h−T , and noting also that ǫq(a, b) = ǫq(−b, −a) we may see that the quantity
(2.9) above does not change if we replace (a, b) by (−b, −a); this is an example of the sym-
metry between π(x; q, a) and π(x; q, aopp) mentioned in the Introduction. Lastly, in arriving
at (2.9) we have paid no attention to error terms, and moreover have used a uniform version
of the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture, both in terms of the size of the parameters in the set
A ∪ T (this is relatively minor) and in terms of the size of the set A ∪ T . To mitigate the last
point, we note that in expanding out the inclusion-exclusion product in (2.5) we may obtain
upper and lower bounds by stopping after an odd or an even number of steps (as in Brun’s
sieve for example); in this manner only a mildly uniform version of the Hardy-Littlewood
conjectures seems needed. For the present we ignore these details, but it would be desirable
to place the conjecture (2.9) on a ﬁrmer footing and we intend to return to this in future
work.

With conjecture (2.9) in hand, we have a conjecture for π(x; q, (a, b)): namely, we sum the

quantity in (2.9) over all positive integers h ≡ b − a (mod q). Thus, we expect that

(2.10)

π(x; q, (a, b)) ∼

Discarding singular series involving sets with three or more elements. We now
conjecture that only terms with A = T = ∅ (which gives rise to the main term of li(x)/φ(q)2
for π(x; q, (a, b))), and |A| + |T | = 2 give signiﬁcant contributions leading to Conjecture 1.1,
and that all other terms contribute to π(x; q, (a, b)) an amount O(x(log log x)2/(log x)3). To
argue this, we will use as a guide the work of Montgomery and Soundararajan (2.2) which
shows that sums over singular series exhibit square-root cancelation in each variable.

Suppose for example that A = ∅ and |T | = ℓ ≥ 4 in (2.11). After summing over the
variable h, these terms may be thought of as (log y)1−ℓ times an average of Sq,0(T ) over ℓ
element sets T whose elements are all of size about log y. The estimate (2.2) now suggests
that this contribution is ≪ (log log y)ℓ/2(log y)1−ℓ/2, and since ℓ ≥ 4 the ﬁnal contribution to
π(x; q, (a, b)) is O(x(log log x)2/(log x)3). If ℓ = 3 then the same argument – drawing on (2.2)
with k = 3 there, so that the main term there vanishes and the bound is O(h3/2−1/21+ǫ) –
indicates that such terms contribute to π(x; q, (a, b)) an amount O(x(log x)−5/2−1/21+ǫ) which
is already smaller than the secondary main terms claimed in Conjecture 1.1. We believe that
when k is odd, the work of Montgomery and Soundararajan can be reﬁned and the actual

8

ROBERT J. LEMKE OLIVER AND KANNAN SOUNDARARAJAN

size of the sum in (2.2) is h(k−1)/2(log h)(k+1)/2. We will pursue this in future work, noting
for the present that this expectation suggests that the terms with A = ∅ and |T | = 3 also
make a contribution of O(x(log log x)2/(log x)3).

When A = {0} or {h}, then a similar heuristic to the above shows that terms with |T | ≥ 2
make a contribution to π(x; q, (a, b)) of O(x(log log x)2/(log x)3). Finally if A = {0, h} and
|T | = ℓ ≥ 1, then the contribution to (2.11) may be roughly thought of as (log y)−ℓ times
an average of singular series Sq,0({0} ∪ T +) where T + (standing for T ∪ {h}) runs over
ℓ + 1 element sets with elements of size log y. Since the singular series Sq,0 is translation
invariant, one can think of this last sum as being 1/(log y) times the average over ℓ + 2
element sets with all elements of size log y. After making this observation, we can draw on
(2.2) (with its proposed reﬁnement for odd k) as earlier and this leads to the prediction
that the contribution to π(x; q, (a, b)) of terms with A = {0, h} and any non-empty T is
O(x(log log x)2/(log x)3).

Thus, discarding all terms with |A| + |T | ≥ 3, we now replace the density D(a, b; y) in

(2.11) with

(2.12)

D(a, b; y) = D0(a, b; y) + D1(a, b; y) + D2(a, b; y),

where (keeping in mind that Sq,0 is 1 for the empty set, and 0 for a singleton)

(2.13)

(2.14)

D1(a, b; y) = −

D0(a, b; y) = Xh>0

Sq,0({t1, t2})α(y)hφ(q)/q.

Inserting this in (2.10), we thus conjecture that up to O(x(log log x)2/(log x)3), there holds

π(x; q, (a, b)) =

The main proposition. To evaluate the sums over two term singular series above, we
invoke the following proposition whose proof we defer to the next section.

Proposition 2.1. Let q ≥ 2, and let v (mod q) be any residue class. For any positive real
number H deﬁne

S0(q, v; H) = Xh>0

h≡v (mod q)

Sq,0({0, h})e−h/H.

Then we may write

and for any v (mod q), the quantity Zq,v(H) is described in (3.2) below, and satisﬁes the
bound Zq,v(H) = O(H−1/2+ǫ), and which we conjecture to be O(H−3/4). Further, if (v, q) = d

We begin by simplifying a bit the expressions for D0, D1 and D2, discarding terms of size
O(log log y/ log y) which are negligible for Conjecture 1.1. Thus, after summing the geometric
series and using (2.17),

D0 = S0(q, b − a; H) + Xh≡b−a (mod q)

e−h/H = S0(q, b − a; H) +

The deﬁnition of D1 involves two singular series Sq,0({0, t}) and Sq,0(t, h). Consider the
terms arising from the second case. Replace Sq,0({t, h}) by Sq,0({0, r}) where r = h − t also
lies in [1, h − 1] and note that the condition (t + a, q) = 1 becomes (r − b, q) = 1. Thus,
ignoring terms of size O(log log y/ log y), the second case in D1 contributes

Using Proposition 2.1 to evaluate (2.18), (2.19), and (2.20), and then inserting that in
(2.10) leads to our Conjecture 1.1. The term involving c1(q; (a, b)) arises from from terms
involving S0(q, 0; H) which has a leading term of size log H while all other S0(q, v; H) are
only of constant size. Thus isolating the − φ(q)
2q log H leading contribution to S0(q, 0; H) and
tracking its appearance in our expressions for D0, D1 and D2 gives

We caution that if χ is an imprimitive character, say induced by χ∗, then Cq,χ 6= Cq,χ∗; in
fact, if χ = χ0,mχ∗ for some m coprime to the conductor of χ∗, then one may observe

Also, write q = q02r with q0 odd. If χ is a character to an odd modulus and q is even, then

Cq,χ = Cq,χ∗ Yp|m

(1 − χ∗(p)).

Using these facts, it is possible to further simplify the formula in (2.22), which yields

This completes our discussion of Conjecture 1.1 in the case r = 2, and the other conjectures

follow as simple consequences.

3. Proof of the Proposition

The proof follows along standard lines, and the closely related case of evaluating asymp-
S0({0, h})(H − h) is mentioned in [5] and treated in detail in [12]. We
will therefore be brief. Let χ be a Dirichlet character modulo m|q; possibly χ could be
imprimitive, or the principal character. Deﬁne, for Re(s) > 1,

which furnishes a meromorphic continuation of Fq,χ(s) to Re(s) > − 1

and now the ﬁnal product above is analytic in Re(s) > −1, but for which the line Re(s) = −1
forms a natural boundary.

If χ is non-principal, then by shifting the line of integration to Re(s) = − 1

2 + ǫ we ﬁnd that
the quantity in (3.1) is L(0, χ)L(1, χ)Aq,χ + O(H− 1
2 +ǫ), with the main term coming from the
pole of Γ(s) at s = 0. Moreover, we may even shift the line of integration to Re(s) = −1 + ǫ
at the cost of picking up residues from the zeros of L(2s + 2, χ2). The contribution from
these zeros is

Zq,χ(H) := Xρ, Re(ρ)>0

Res

s=ρ/2−1(cid:16)Fq,χ(s)H sΓ(s)(cid:17).

L(ρ,χ2)=0

If we suppose that GRH holds for L(s, χ2), that its zeros are simple, and that |L′(ρ, χ2)| is
not too small so that (in view of the exponential decay of Γ(s)) the sum over residues is
absolutely convergent, then we would expect that Zq,χ(H) is an oscillating term of size H− 3
4 .
If χ is principal, but m > 1, then Fq,χ(s) has a pole at s = 1 with residue φ(m)/m, but
there is no pole of Fq,χ at s = 0 since L(s, χ0) = sΛ(m) + O(s2) for s near 0. Therefore in
this situation we ﬁnd

χ0(h)e−h/H Sq({0, h}) =

φ(m)

m

H −

φ(q)
2q

Λ(m) + Zq,χ0(H) + O(H−1+ǫ).

Xh≥1

Finally if m = 1 (and χ is naturally principal) the corresponding Fq,χ(s) has a simple pole
at s = 0 in addition to the pole at s = 1. Thus there is a double pole of the integrand in
(3.1), and computing residues we obtain that

4. Modifications to the heuristics when r ≥ 3

The ideas leading to the general case of Conjecture 1.1 are similar to those for r = 2, and so
we just give a brief sketch. For r ≥ 3 and a = (a1, . . . , ar), we start by writing π(x; q, a) as

Xn≤x

n≡a1 (mod q)

Xh1,...,hr−1>0

1P(n)

hi≡ai+1−ai (mod q)

r−1

Yi=1h1P(n + h1 + · · · + hi)·

· Y0<t<hi

(t+ai,q)=1

(1 − 1P(n + h1 + · · · + hi−1 + t))i.

As before, we expand this out, invoke the Hardy-Littlewood conjectures, and then discard
all singular series terms except for the empty set and sets with two elements. This leads to

q

qr−1

φ(q)r(cid:16)1 −

π(x; q, a) = Z x

(log y)r + O(cid:16)x(log log x)2
(cid:17),
where εq(a) = εq(a1, a2) + · · · + εq(ar−1, ar) and D0, D1, and D2 are certain smooth sums of
singular series. For D0, we have (with H = H(y) as before)

(cid:0)D0 + D1 + D2(cid:1)(a; y)

φ(q) log y(cid:17)εq(a)

log3 x

dy

D0 = Xh1,...,hr−1>0

e−(h1+···+hr−1)/H(cid:16)1 + X0≤i<j≤r−1

Sq,0({0, hi+1 + · · · + hj})(cid:17).

Notice that if j = i + 1 in the inner summation, the resulting expression is (H/q)r−2 times
the analogous D0 term in the two-competitor race π(x; q, (aj, aj+1)). If j − i > 1, we will
need to consider sums of the form

Sk

0 (q, v; H) := Xh≡v (mod q)

hke−h/H Sq,0({0, h}),

where k = j − i − 1. This can be understood via contour integration as in Proposition 2.1;
a key diﬀerence is that for k ≥ 1, we have Sk
0 (q, v; H) = O(H k−1/2) unless v = 0, in which
case Sk
2q Γ(k)H k + O(H k−1/2). Using this to evaluate D0, we ﬁnd that it is

5. Comparison of the conjecture with numerical data

these cases, our conjecture is that

with the sign being negative if a1 ≡ a2 (mod q) and positive if not. However, in order
to obtain (5.1) in such a clean form, a number of asymptotic approximations were used
throughout Section 2, and it is reasonable to expect that the unsimpliﬁed integral expression
(2.16) for π(x; q, a) would provide a better ﬁt to the data. Indeed, we ﬁnd the following.

UNEXPECTED BIASES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF CONSECUTIVE PRIMES

15

Going forward, we will present only the comparison of π(x; q, a) against (2.16), so we ex-
plain brieﬂy how we compute this approximation. In (2.18), (2.19) and (2.20), we determined
D0, D1 and D2 in terms of S0(q, v; H) and in the process replaced geometric progressions in h
with suitable approximations. Of course the geometric progressions could just be computed
exactly. We keep the exact but messy expressions so obtained, and for S0(q, v; H) use the
main terms described in Proposition 2.1. This yields an expression for π(x; q, a) as an ex-
plicit integral, which we computed numerically in Sage. The actual values of π(x; q, a) were
computed in C++ using the primesieve library. Code for both computations can be found on
the ﬁrst author’s website.

Next we consider q = 8. Here too the constants simplify, with c2(8; (a, b)) depending
only on the diﬀerence b − a (mod 8) (a fact reﬂected in the data). Explicitly, we have
c2(8; (a, a)) = (5 log 2 − 3 log π)/2, c2(8; (a, a + 2)) = c2(8; (a, a + 6)) = (log π − log 2)/2, and
c2(8; (a, a + 4)) = (log π − 3 log 2)/2. Thus, we should expect that, among the non-diagonal
patterns, those with b − a = 4 should be the least frequent, and that those with b − a = 2
and 6 should be rather close. Indeed, we ﬁnd:

We now turn to the patterns (mod 12). Here, the quadratic character χ (mod 3) plays a
role for those patterns (a, b) with a 6≡ b (mod 3). In particular, it does not play a role in the
diagonal patterns, for which c2(12; a) is given by (1.1). For non-diagonal patterns, we have:

(The other values of c2(12; a) are determined by c2(12; aopp).)

Here, A12,χ ≈ 1.036, so that c2(12; (5, 7)) and c2(12; (11, 1)) are the largest of these. More-
over, as in the (mod 8) case, there are symmetries between patterns with the same diﬀerence
b − a. We ﬁnd the following.

We close by considering q = 5 (which amounts to considering the last decimal digit of
primes). Essentially no simplﬁcations can be made for the constants c2(q; a). For any non-
diagonal pattern (a, b), we ﬁnd

log(2π/5)

where χ is either of the complex characters (mod 5). Apart from the understood symmetry
c2(5; (a, b)) = c2(5; (−b, −a)), the value of c2 determines the pattern. Thus, we might expect
signiﬁcant variation between the various patterns, and in particular no additional symmetries
like we saw (mod 8) and (mod 12). We ﬁnd, presenting only the ﬁrst of (a, b) and (−b, −a):

An interesting feature to be observed here is that, initially, π(x; 5, (1, 2)) is larger than
π(x; 5, (1, 3)), despite our conjecture predicting the opposite ordering. In fact, this is true for
all x between 41,231 and 5.076 · 1011. However, at about 5.082 · 1011, π(x; 5, (1, 3)) becomes
consistently larger, seemingly forever, exactly as our conjecture would predict. We take this
as reasonable evidence for our speculation that there are even more lower-order terms (e.g.,
on the order of x(log log x)2/ log3 x), which in this case apparently conspire to point in the
opposite direction than the bias in Conjecture 1.1.
