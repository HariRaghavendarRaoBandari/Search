PROJECTIVE MODEL STRUCTURES FOR EXACT CATEGORIES

JACK KELLY

Abstract. In this article we provide suﬃcient conditions on weakly idempotent complete exact categories
E which admit an abelian embedding, such that various categories of chain complexes in E are equipped
In particular we show that as soon as E has enough projectives, the
with projective model structures.
category Ch`pEq of bounded below complexes is equipped with a projective model structure. In the case
that E also admits all kernels we show that it is also true of Chě0pEq, and that a generalisation of the
Dold-Kan correspondence holds. Supplementing the existence of kernels with a condition on the existence
and exactness of certain direct limit functors guarantees that the category of unbounded chain complexes
ChpEq also admits a projective model structure. When E is monoidal we also examine when these model
structures are monoidal and conclude by studying some homotopical algebra in such categories. Along the
way we also discuss generators in exact categories.

1. Introduction

Let k be a ﬁeld of characteristic 0. It is well known (see [Hov07]) that there is a projective model structure
on the category Chpkq of unbounded chain complexes in the abelian category Vectk of k-vector spaces
in which weak equivalences are quasi-isomorphisms and ﬁbrations are degreewise epimorphisms. Chpkq
is equipped with a natural monoidal structure, inherited from the one on Vectk.
It is also known that
the category cdgak of commutative diﬀerential graded algebras over k inherits a model structure from
Chpkq (this is shown, for example, in [Lur11]). This model category is equipped with various homotopy
Grothendieck topologies arising from the monoidal structure. In arbitrary characteristic, one can also work
in the category sVectk of simplicial k-vector spaces, see [Qui06].

Lately there has been much progress in developing theories of derived analytic geometry.

In recent
work of Ben-Bassat, Kremnizer and Bambozzi, namely [BBK13], [BBB15], [Bam14] and [BBBK15] the
authors develop a functor of points approach to analytic geometry. They begin with a normed ﬁeld k, and
consider both the monoidal categories IndpBankq of indizations of Banach spaces over k, and CBornk of
complete bornological spaces of convex type over k. These categories are not quite abelian. However they
are quasi-abelian. Quasi-abelian categories are a sub-class of the class of so-called Quillen exact categories.
These are additive categories equipped with a suitable notion of homology.
In particular, in [BBBK15]
the authors use this homological structure to construct a Grothendieck topology on a subcategory St of
pCommpCBornkqqop. St is equivalent to the category of (dagger) Stein spaces, and when k “ C the
coverings in their topology correspond to coverings of Stein spaces by Stein spaces. They mention also that
there should be a model structure together with a suitable homotopy Grothendieck topology on the category
of commutative simplicial algebras in CBornk, CommpsCBornkqop which induces the topology on St. In
particular, this gives one possible direction for developing derived analytic geometry.

Instead of simplicial objects, in this paper we shall consider model structures on chain complexes in
quasi-abelian, and more generally exact categories E. Our primary goal is to establish the existence of
projective model structures under suitable conditions on categories of chain complexes in E, and to study
some homotopical algebra in such categories. The strategy is as follows.
In [Hov02], Hovey developed
a method for endowing abelian categories A with model structures using the homological data of Hovey
Triples. Gillespie noted in [Gil11] that this works for (weakly idempotent complete) exact categories as well.
Hovey also discusses when Hovey Triples produce coﬁbrantly small model structures, and monoidal model
structures in the case that A is monoidal. We show that these results also generalise to exact categories. In
[Gil04], [Gil07] and [Gil08] Gillespie develops a method for constructing a Hovey Triple on chain complexes
in an abelian category A from a cotorsion pair on A. Again we generalise this to bounded below complexes
in exact categories, and assuming some mild extra assumptions on E, unbounded complexes as well.

3

This paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we recall some basic facts about exact categories following
[B¨uh10] and discuss various notions of acyclicity in such categories. We also give our deﬁnition of a monoidal
exact category, Deﬁnition 2.67.

In Section 3 we discuss generators and introduce elementary exact categories. The main technical result
of this section is Corollary 3.17, which says that categories of chain complexes in elementary exact categories
are themselves elementary. We also study generators in categories of algebras for monads.

In Section 4 we recall Hovey’s (or Gillespie’s in the case of exact cateogries) bijection between Hovey Triples
and compatible model structures. Next we generalise Hovey’s results on coﬁbrant generation (Lemma 4.16)
and monoidal model structures (Theorem 4.18, Lemma 4.22, Theorem 4.24) to the exact case. Finally we
show that Gillespie’s method for constructing Hovey Triples on chain complexes can also be generalised to
the exact case (Subsection 4.5).
In Section 5 we apply the results of Section 4 to construct projective model structures. Assuming only the
existence of enough projectives we obtain such a model structure on Ch`pEq (Theorem 5.3). If in addition we
allow E to have kernels, then we get a model structure on Chě0pEq (Theorem 5.7). We show that when the
exact category is elementary, these model structures are coﬁbrantly small. For monoidal elementary exact
categories we show under some mild extra assumptions that the resulting model structures on Chě0pEq and
ChpEq are monoidal and satisfy the monoid axiom (Theorem 5.13 and Theorem 5.14).

Finally in section 6 we discuss categories of monoids in monoidal exact categories equipped with compatible
model structures. More generally we discuss model structures on monoidal additive categories which make
them suitable settings for homotopical algebra. In particular, we show that for such a category, the categories
of commutative monoids and Lie monoids are equipped with transferred model structures (Proposition 6.4
and Proposition 6.5).

In Appendix A we review some general facts concerning algebra in symmetric monoidal additive categories,

while Appendix B contains important results about model categories which we use throughout this work.

1.1. Notation and Conventions.

1.1.1. Categories. Throughout this work we will use the following notation.

‚ Ab is the abelian category of abelian groups.
‚ If k is a ﬁeld, then Vectk denotes the category of vector spaces over k.
‚ Unless stated otherwise, the unit in a monoidal category will be denoted by k, the tensor functor by
b, and for a closed monoidal category the internal hom functor will be denoted by Hom. Monoidal
categories will always be assumed to be symmetric, with symmetric braiding σ.

‚ If C , D are categories then rC , Ds denotes the category of covariant functors between them.
‚ Filtered colimits will be denoted by limÑ.
‚ We will say a category is bicomplete if it has all limits and colimits.

1.1.2. Chain Complexes. Let us now introduce some conventions for chain complexes.

Deﬁnition 1.1. A chain complex in a preadditive category E is a sequence

K‚ “ . . .

where the Ki are objects and the di are morphisms such that dn´1 ˝ dn “ 0. The morphisms are called

diﬀerentials.
A morphism of chain complexes f‚ : K‚ Ñ L‚ is a collection of morphisms fn : Kn Ñ Ln such
that the following diagram commutes for each n:

/ Kn

dn /

/ Kn´1

The category whose objects are chain complexes and whose morphisms are as described above is called the
category of chain complexes in E, denoted ChpEq. We also deﬁne Chě0pEq to be the full subcategory
of ChpEq on complexes A‚ such that An “ 0 for n ă 0, Chď0pEq to be the full subcategory of ChpEq on
complexes A‚ such that An “ 0 for n ą 0, Ch`pEq, the full subcategory of chain complexes A‚ such that
An “ 0 for n ăă 0, Ch´pEq, the full subcategory of chain complexes A‚ such that An “ 0 for n ąą 0 and
ChbpEq to be the full subcategory of ChpEq on complexes A‚ such that An ‰ 0 for only ﬁnitely many n. A
lot of the statements in the rest of this document apply to several of these categories at once. In such cases
we will write Ch˚pEq, and specify that ˚ can be any element of some subset of tě 0,ď 0,`,´, b,Hu, where
by deﬁnition ChHpEq “ ChpEq.
All of the above categories are naturally enriched over ChpAbq. We denote the enriched hom by
Homp´,´q. For notational clarity we recall its deﬁnition here.
Deﬁnition 1.2. Let X‚, Y‚ P ChpEq. We deﬁne HompX‚, Y‚q P ChpAbq to be the complex with

HompX‚, Y‚qn “

HomEpXi, Yi`nq

ź

iPZ

and diﬀerential dn deﬁned on HomEpXi, Yi`nq by
df “ dY

i`n ˝ f ´ p´1qnf ˝ dX

i

We will also frequently use the following special chain complexes.

Deﬁnition 1.3. If E is an object of an exact category E we let SnpEq P ChpEq be the complex whose nth
entry is E, with all other entries being 0. We also denote by DnpEq P ChpEq the complex whose nth and
pn ´ 1qst entries are E, with all other entries being 0, and the diﬀerential dn being the identity.

Let pE,b, kq be a monoidal additive category, i.e. b is an additive bifunctor. There is an induced monoidal
structure on Ch˚pEq for ˚ P tě 0,ď 0,`,´, b,Hu. The unit is S0pkq. If X‚ and Y‚ are chain complexes
then we set

à

i`j“n

pX‚ b Y‚qn “

Xi b Yj

If i ` j “ n, then we deﬁne the diﬀerential on the summand Xi b Yj of pX‚ b Y‚qn by

dX‚bY‚

n

|XibYj “ dX‚

i b idY‚ ` p´1qiidX‚ b dY‚

j

If ˚ P tě 0,ď 0,`,´, b,Hu then pCh˚pEq,b, S0pkqq is a monoidal additive category.
If pE,b, k, Homq is a closed monoidal additive category then we deﬁne a functor

Homp´,´q : ChpEqop ˆ ChpEq Ñ ChpEq

HompX‚, Y‚qn “

HomEpXi, Yi`nq

ź

iPZ

and diﬀerential dn deﬁned on HomEpXi, Yi`nq by
d “ HompdX‚

, idq ` p´1qiHompid, dY‚
i`nq

i

This does deﬁne an internal hom on the monoidal category

pChpEq,b, S0pkqq

The internal hom on chain complexes also restricts to a bifunctor

Homp´,´q : ChbpEqop ˆ ChbpEq Ñ ChbpEq

Then

pChbpEq,b, S0pkq, Homq

is a closed monoidal additive category. In fact, in both of these categories there are natural isomorphisms of
chain complexes of abelian groups.

The categories Ch˚pEq for ˚ P t`,´, b,Hu also come equipped with a shift functor. It is given on objects

HompX‚, HompY‚, Z‚qq – HompX‚ b Y‚, Z‚q

with diﬀerential given by

pA‚r1sqi “ Ai`1
dAr1s

i

The shift of a morphism f‚ is given by pf‚r1sqi “ fi`1. r1s is an auto-equivalence with inverse r´1s. We

set r0s “ Id and rns “ r1sn for any integer n.

Finally, we deﬁne the mapping cone as follows.
Deﬁnition 1.4. Let X‚ and Y‚ be chain complexes in an additive category E and f‚ : X‚ Ñ Y‚. The
mapping cone of f‚, denoted conepf‚q is the complex whose components are

and whose diﬀerential is

dconepfq

“

There are natural morphisms τ : Y‚ Ñ conepfq induced by the injections Yi Ñ Xi´1 ‘ Yi, and π :

conepfq Ñ X‚r´1s induced by the projections Xi´1 ‘ Yi Ñ Xi´1. The sequence

Y‚ Ñ conepfq Ñ X‚r´1s

is split exact in each degree.

Finally let us introduce some notation for truncation functors.

Deﬁnition 1.5. Let E be an additive category which has kernels. For a complex X‚ we denote by τěnX
the complex such that pτěnXqm “ 0 if m ă n, pτěnXqm “ Xm if m ą n and pτěnXqn “ Kerpdnq. The
diﬀerentials are the obvious ones. The construction is clearly functorial.

2. Exact Category Generalities

In this section we review the main notions of exact categories, following [B¨uh10]. In the following E will be
an additive category. A kernel-cokernel pair in E is a pair of composable maps pi, pq, i : A Ñ B, p : B Ñ C
such that i “ Kerppq and p “ Cokerpiq. If Q is a class of kernel-cokernel pairs and pi, pq P Q, then we say
that i is an admissible monic and p is an admissible epic with respect to Q.
Deﬁnition 2.1. A Quillen exact structure on an additive category E is a collection Q of kernel-cokernel
pairs such that

(1) Isomorphisms are both admissible monics and admissible epics.

(2) Both the collection of admissible monics and the collection of admissible epics are closed under com-

position.

(4) If

is a pullback diagram, and f is an admissible epic, then f1 is as well.

Let pE,Qq be an exact category. We call a null sequence

0

/ A i

/ B

p

/ C

/ 0

short exact if pi, pq is a kernel-cokernel pair in Q. We will use interchangeably the notion of kernel-cokernel
pair and short exact sequence. In the context of diagrams in exact categories (cid:26) will be used to denote an
admissible monic, and (cid:16) an admissible epic. When it is not likely to cause confusion, we will suppress the
notation pE,Qq to E.

When studying exact categories it is natural to consider so-called exact functors:

Deﬁnition 2.2. Let pE,Pq, pF ,Qq be exact categories. A functor F : E Ñ F is said to be exact (with
respect to P and Q) if for any short exact sequence

in P,

0 Ñ X Ñ Y Ñ Z Ñ 0

0 Ñ FpXq Ñ FpY q Ñ FpZq Ñ 0

is a short exact sequence in Q.
Deﬁnition 2.3. Let pE,Pq be an exact category. An exact subcategory of pE,Pq is an exact category
pF ,Qq where F is a subcategory of E and the inclusion functor is exact.

Note that in an exact category pE,Qq the map A Ñ 0 is an admissible epic and the map 0 Ñ A is an
admissible monic for any object A. This follows from the fact that id : A Ñ A is both an admissible epic
and an admissible monic, and the fact that

and

0 Ñ 0 Ñ A Ñ A Ñ 0

0 Ñ A Ñ A Ñ 0 Ñ 0

are short exact sequences. As a consequence any split exact sequence

0 Ñ A Ñ A ‘ B Ñ B Ñ 0

is short exact. Indeed in the following diagram

the left-hand square is a pushout and the right-hand square is a pullback.

The class of split exact sequences actually deﬁnes an exact structure, split on any additive category E.

The above remarks imply the following proposition.
Proposition 2.4. Let pE,Qq be an exact category. Then the identity functor idE is an exact functor
pE, splitq Ñ pE,Qq.

At the other extreme we have quasi-abelian exact structures.

Deﬁnition 2.5. An additive category E with all kernels and cokernels is said to be quasi-abelian if the
class qac of all kernel-cokernel pairs forms an exact structure on E.

The following is then tautological.

Proposition 2.6. Let E be a quasi-abelian category, and let Q be a class of kernel-cokernel pairs on E such
that pE,Qq is an exact category. Then the identity functor idE is an exact functor pE,Qq Ñ pE, qacq.

We will study quasi-abelian structures in more detail later. For now let us note that abelian categories are
quasi-abelian. In an abelian category all monics are kernels of their cokernels, and all epics are cokernels of
their kernels. It therefore trivially follows that both classes are closed under composition. It is also clear that
both classes contain all isomorphisms. It is a standard exercise that in an abelian category, monomorphisms
are pushout-stable and epimorphisms are pullback-stable. See for example [Fre64] Theorem 2.54. Let us
now record some basic results about exact categories which will prove useful.
Proposition 2.7. Let h : X Ñ Y and f : A Ñ Y be morphisms in an additive category E. Suppose
g : K Ñ X is a kernel of h and that the following diagram

with g1 : K Ñ A1 being a kernel of q.
Dually, if f : Y Ñ A and h : Y Ñ X are morphisms in an additive category E, g : X Ñ C is a cok-
ernel of h and the following diagram

is a pullback. Then there is a commutative diagram

where g1 : Y 1 Ñ C is a cokernel of k.
Proof. Consider the zero morphism 0 : K Ñ A. Then h ˝ g “ 0 “ f ˝ 0. So there is a unique morphism
g1 : K Ñ A1 such q ˝ g1 “ 0 and k ˝ g1 “ g. This gives the commutative diagram. It remains to show that g1
is a kernel of q. Let r : Z Ñ A1 be a morphism such that q ˝ r “ 0. Then h ˝ k ˝ r “ f ˝ q ˝ r “ 0. Thus
there is a unique map t : Z Ñ K such that g ˝ t “ k ˝ r. But then k ˝ g1 ˝ t “ k ˝ r. Moreover, q ˝ g1 ˝ t “ 0.
This means g1 ˝ t “ r. If t1 is another map such that g1 ˝ t1 “ r, then g ˝ t1 “ k ˝ g1 ˝ t1 “ k ˝ r. But t was the
unique map such that g ˝ t “ k ˝ r, so t “ t1. Hence g1 : K Ñ A1 is a kernel of q : A1 Ñ A
(cid:3)
The second part is dual.

In fact in an exact category we actually have the following useful result.

Proposition 2.8. Let

A /

Proof. See [B¨uh10] Proposition 2.12.

(cid:3)

For technical reasons, unless stated otherwise we will assume from now on that all exact categories are
weakly idempotent complete. This means that every retraction has a kernel, or equivalently, that every
coretraction has a cokernel. Note that the condition is self-dual. Quasi-abelian categories are in particular
weakly idempotent complete. In weakly idempotent complete exact categories, we then have the following
useful result, often called the Obscure Axiom.

Proposition 2.9 (The Obscure Axiom).

(1) Suppose that i : A Ñ B is a morphism. If there exists a
morphism j : B Ñ C such that the composite ji : A Ñ C is an admissible monic, then i is an

(2) Suppose that i : A Ñ B is a morphism. If there exists a morphism j : C Ñ A such that i ˝ j is an

admissible epic, then i is an an admissible epic.

(cid:3)
Proof. See [B¨uh10] Proposition 2.16.
2.0.3. The Embedding Theorem. Let pE,Qq be an exact category. Let F be a full subcategory of E. Suppose
that F is closed under extensions, that is if

0 Ñ A Ñ B Ñ C Ñ 0

is a short exact sequence in pE, Qq with A and C objects of F , then B is an object of F as well. Let QF
consist of those kernel-cokernel pairs pi : A Ñ B, q : B Ñ Cq in F which when regarded as pairs of morphisms
in E are kernel-cokernel pairs in Q. It is then straight-forward to show ([BMSG`10]) that pF ,QF q is an
exact subcategory of pE,Qq. It turns out that any small exact category can be obtained as a full subcategory
of an abelian category which is closed under extensions. This is the main content of the Quillen Embedding
Theorem which provides an invaluable tool for studying exact categories.

Theorem 2.10 (The Quillen Embedding Theorem). Let E be a small exact category. Then there is an
abelian category ApEq and a fully faithful additive functor I : E Ñ ApEq which is exact, reﬂects exactness,
and preserves all kernels. Moreover the essential image of I is closed under extensions. ApEq may be chosen
to be the category of left-exact functors E Ñ Ab. If in addition E is weakly idempotent complete then a
morphism f : E Ñ F in E is an admissible epic if and only if Ipfq is an epic in ApEq.
(cid:3)
Proof. See Appendix A in [B¨uh10].
Deﬁnition 2.11. We call an embedding I : E Ñ A of an exact category into an abelian category a left
abelianization of E if

(1) I is fully faithful.

(2) I is exact.

(3) I reﬂects exactness.

(4) The essential image of I is closed under extensions.

(5) I preserves all kernels which exist.
(6) If f is a morphism in E, then f is an admissible epic if and only if Ipfq is an epic.
In particular, Theorem 2.10 says that any small exact category admits a left abelianization. Dually there

is a notion of a right abelianization
Deﬁnition 2.12. We call an embedding I : E Ñ A of an exact category into an abelian category a right
abelianization of E if

(1) I is fully faithful.

(2) I is exact.

(3) I reﬂects exactness.

(4) The essential image of I is closed under extensions.

(5) I preserves all cokernels which exist.

10

(6) If f is a morphism in E, then f is an admissible monic if and only if Ipfq is a monic.

Remark 2.13. It is clear that right abelianizations of small exact categories exist. Indeed, if E op Ñ A is a
left-abelianization of E op, then E Ñ A op is a right-abelianization of E

From now on unless stated otherwise, we will assume that all our categories are equipped with both a
left and right abelianisation. This is not just true of small exact categories. For example any quasi-abelian
category has both a left and right abelianisation.

2.1. Notions of Acyclicity. In a general exact category, arbitrary kernels and cokernels may not exist.
Therefore it is not in general possible even to write down candidates for the homology objects of a chain
complex. Even if all kernels and cokernels do exist, then there are multiple candidates for the homology
which are not isomorphic in general. For example, given a null sequene

Γ “ E

f

/ F

g

/ G

i.e. g ˝ f “ 0, one could consider both CokerpImpfq Ñ Kerpgqq and ImpKerpgq Ñ Cokerpfqq.
In an
abelian category these are isomorphic, but for general additive categories this is not the case. Despite these
ambiguities, there are still various useful notions of acyclicity in exact categories, which we discuss below.
First let us deﬁne several classes of morphisms.
Deﬁnition 2.14. A morphism f : E Ñ F in an exact category is said to be

(1) weakly left admissible if it has a kernel and the map

Kerpfq Ñ E

is admissible.

(2) weakly right admissible if it has a cokernel, and the map

F Ñ Cokerpfq

is admissible.

(3) weakly admissible if it is both weakly left admissible and weakly right admissible.

The following characterisation of weakly admissible morphisms is immediate.

Proposition 2.15. A morphism f : E Ñ F in an exact category E is weakly admissible if and only if it
admits a decomposition

This is not how admissible morphisms are usually deﬁned (see e.g.
equivalent:
Proposition 2.18. Let f : E Ñ F be a morphism in an exact category E. Then the following are equivalent.

[B¨uh10]). However the notions are

(1) f is admissible.

(2) f admits a decomposition

Proof. 1 and 3 are clearly equivalent thanks to Proposition 2.15. Also 3 ñ 2 trivially. Let us show that
2 ñ 1. Since I (cid:26) F is an admissible monic, the kernel of f exists, and coincides with the kernel of E (cid:16) I.
Hence Kerpfq Ñ E is an admissible monic and in particular E Ñ I is a coimage of f . Dually, the cokernel
of f exists, it coincides with the cokernel of G (cid:26) F , and I (cid:26) F is an image of f .
(cid:3)
Corollary 2.19. A morphism f : E Ñ F in an exact category is an isomorphism if and only if it is both
an admissible epic and an admissible monic.

Proof. Axiomatically an isomorphism is both an admissible monic and an admissible epic.

Conversely, suppose f is both an admissible monic and an admissible epic. Since it is an admissible monic
the map E Ñ Coimpfq is an isomorphism. Since it is an admissible epic the map Impfq Ñ E is an isomor-
phism. Since f is admissible the map Coimpfq Ñ Impfq is an isomorphism. The claim now follows from the
commutative diagram

Coimpgq is an isomorphism.

(1) Suppose the above sequence is admissibly acyclic. Since f is admissible I preserves Impfq. By

13

assumption I preserves all kernels. Hence

IpXq Ipfq /

/ IpY q Ipgq /

/ IpZq

is exact.

(2) Suppose now that

IpXq Ipfq /

/ IpY q Ipgq /

/ IpZq

is exact and that f is weakly admissible. Since I preserves all kernels, and cokernels of admissible
morphisms, we have IpCoimpfqq – CoimIpfq. Now

CoimIpfq – ImIpfq – KerIpgq

Since I is fully faithful, Coimpfq is a kernel of g. Finally, note that we have a factorisation of
Coimpfq Ñ Kerpgq
By Proposition 2.9 Impfq (cid:26) Kerpgq is also an (admissible) epic. By Corollary 2.19 it is an isomor-
phism. Therefore Coimpfq Ñ Impfq is as well. By Proposition 2.18 we are done.

Coimpfq Ñ Impfq (cid:26) Kerpgq

with Kerpgq Ñ Y an admissible monic. We need to show f1 is an admissible epic. Since I preserves
kernels, it sends the diagram above to

(cid:3)

Part 1) of the above proposition says that the functor I is admissibly exact. This is a stronger notion

than exactness. It will be useful in later contexts, so we make a deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 2.24. A functor F : E Ñ F between exact categories is said to be admissibly (co)exact if for
any admissibly (co)acyclic sequence

X Ñ Y Ñ Z

in E, the sequence

FpXq Ñ FpY q Ñ FpZq

is admissibly (co)acyclic. A functor which is both admissibly exact and admissibly coexact is said to be
strongly exact.

Moreover, the proof of Part 1) also gives the following result.

Proposition 2.25. Let F : E Ñ D be an exact functor which preserves kernels. Then F is admissibly exact.
Example 2.26. It is easy to show that taking ﬁnite direct sums is a strongly exact functor. Indeed being
both a limit and a colimit, this functor commutes with all limits and colimits.

Although the functor I reﬂects short exact sequences, it need not in general reﬂect acyclicity of unbounded

complexes. However it does for a certain nice class of complexes.
Deﬁnition 2.27. A complex X‚ in an exact category is said to be good if for each n there is m ă n such
that dm has a kernel. X‚ is said to be cogood if for each n there is m ą n such that dm has a cokernel.
Example 2.28. Bounded below complexes are good.

We will frequently use the following trick for good complexes.

Proposition 2.29. Let X‚ be a good complex in an exact category. Suppose that for any n such that dX
n
has a kernel, the induced map

n`1 : Xn`1 Ñ ZnX
d1

is an admissible epic. Then X‚ is acyclic.
Proof. Suppose dm has a kernel. By assumption dm`1 factors as
Xm`1 (cid:16) ZmX Ñ Xm

A priori ZmX Ñ Xm is not admissible. However it is a monomorphism. Therefore, since Xm`1 (cid:16) ZmX
is admissible its kernel exists and it coincides with the kernel Zm`1X of dm`1. Since Xm`1 (cid:16) ZmX is
admissible it is in particular weakly left admissible. Therefore dm`1 is also weakly left admissible. Now
consider dm`2. By assumption it factors as

dm`2 : Xm`2 (cid:16) Zm`1X (cid:26) Xm`1

Thus dm`2 is an admissible morphism whose image is Zm`1X. An easy induction then shows that X‚ is
(cid:3)
acyclic.

Since I preserves kernels and reﬂects admissible epimorphisms, Proposition 2.29 gives the following.

Corollary 2.30. Let pX‚, d‚q be a complex in E. Let I : E Ñ A be a left abelianisation of E. Suppose X‚
is good. Then X‚ is acyclic if and only if IpX‚q is.
Proof. Suppose IpX‚q is a acyclic, and dX
IpZnXq is an epimorphism. Thus d1

n`1 : Xn`1 Ñ ZnX is an admissible epimorphism.

n has a kernel ZnX. By assumption Ipd1

n`1q : IpXn`1q Ñ ZnIpXq “
(cid:3)

2.2. Homotopies and Quasi-Isomorphisms. Let us now discuss homological properties of maps between
complexes.
Deﬁnition 2.31. A homotopy between morphisms of chain complexes f‚, g‚ : K‚ Ñ L‚ is a collection of
morphisms Di : Ai Ñ Bi`1 such that

fi ´ gi “ Di´1 ˝ dK

i ` dL

i`1 ˝ Di

We then say f‚ „ g‚.
Deﬁnition 2.32. Two complexes K‚ and L‚ are said to be homotopy equivalent if there are maps g :
K‚ Ñ L‚ and f : L‚ Ñ K‚ such that f ˝ g „ idK‚ and g ˝ f „ idL‚.

If

if there are two maps D : B Ñ X and D1 : C Ñ Y such α “ f ˝ D ´ D1 ˝ q.

We can use homotopies in an exact category to test for acyclicity.

For the converse, note that by Proposition 2.33 and the fact that Kerpgq Ñ Y is admissible, we have a

decomposition of f
By Proposition 2.18 f is an admissible morphism whose image is Kerpgq.

We can also test split exactness by looking at homotopy.

Proposition 2.35. Let E be an exact category, and let

left admissible and the diagram

is homotopic to zero.

Proof. Suppose the diagram is homotopic to the zero. If we can show that g is also weakly left admissible
in the split exact structure, then the claim follows from Corollary 2.34. By Corollary 2.34 we already know
that the sequence is admissibly acyclic, so Impfq – Kerpgq. Let D : Y Ñ X and D1 : Z Ñ Y be maps such
that idY “ f ˝ D ´ D1 ˝ g. The map f ˝ D : Y Ñ Y factors as

where i is the inclusion. But
since g ˝ i “ 0. It follows that

˜pf ˝ Dq˝ i “ IdImpfq. This implies that the map Kerpgq – Impfq Ñ Y is split,

motopic to 0, and such that the induced maps ˜fn : KerpdY

n q Ñ KerpdX

(2) X‚ is split exact whenever idX‚ is homotopic to 0.

Proof. The ﬁrst assertion follows from Proposition 2.29 and Proposition 2.33. For the second assertion note
that X‚ is acyclic by the ﬁrst. In particular each

Xn`1 Ñ Xn Ñ Xn´1

is acyclic, and Xn Ñ Xn´1 is (weakly left) admissible. Thus we may use Proposition 2.35.
2.2.1. Quasi-Isomorphisms. Recall that in an abelian category a map of complexes induces a map on ho-
mology. The map is said to be a quasi-isomorphism if the induced map on homology is an isomorphism.
Quasi-isomorphisms can also be characterised in terms of their mapping cone. A map of chain complexes in
an abelian category is a quasi-isomorphism if and only if its mapping cone is acyclic. As remarked previously,
in an exact category we cannot in general deﬁne the homology of a complex. However the construction of
the mapping cone makes sense in any additive category. By the previous remarks, the following deﬁnition is
sensible.
Deﬁnition 2.37. Let E be an exact category. A map f‚ : X‚ Ñ Y‚ of complexes of E is said to be a
quasi-isomorphism if conepf‚q is acyclic.
Proposition 2.38. Homotopy equivalences are quasi-isomorphisms.

(cid:3)

Proof. See [B¨uh10] Proposition 10.9.

(cid:3)

The next proposition is an immediate consequence of Corollary 2.30.

Proposition 2.39. Let I : E Ñ A be a left abelianisation of an exact category E. Let f‚ : X‚ Ñ Y‚ be a
morphism of complexes. Suppose conepfqm is good. Then f is a quasi-isomorphim if and only if Ipfq is.
Remark 2.40. As for abelian categories, one can deﬁne the derived category D˚pEq of an exact category E
by localizing Ch˚pEq at the quasi-isomorphisms. For details see for example [B¨uh10].

2.3. Ext Groups. In order to study cotorsion pairs in exact categories in Section 3, we will need to ﬁrst
introduce Ext groups in exact categories. Recall for an abelian category A one can deﬁne the groups
ExtnpA, Bq for any pair of objects A, B P A regardless of whether A has enough projectives. The elements
are Yoneda equivalences classes of n-extensions and the binary operation is the Baer sum. Moreover for
objects A, C, D and integers m, n there are bilinear maps

φn,m : ExtnpA, Cq ˆ ExtmpC, Dq Ñ Extn`mpA, Dq

All of this works mutatis mutandis for weakly idempotent complete exact categories E once we make the

following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 2.41. Let A and C be objects of E, and let n ą 0 be an integer. An n-fold extension of A by
C is an acyclic sequence

0 Ñ C Ñ En Ñ En´1 Ñ . . . Ñ E1 Ñ A Ñ 0

Moreover in this greater generality we still get the long-exact sequences on Ext groups. let

be short exact. We deﬁne a map δn : ExtnpX, Cq Ñ Extn`1pZ, Cq for each n ą 0 as follows:

/ X α /

/ Y

β

/ Z

0

/ 0

Recall we have a bilinear map

φ1,n : Ext1pZ, Xq ˆ ExtnpX, Cq Ñ Extn`1pZ, Cq

Let K be the class in Ext1pZ, Xq representing

0

/ X α /

/ Y

β

/ Z

/ 0

We set δn “ φ1,npK,´q.
Theorem 2.42. Let

0 Ñ X Ñ Y Ñ Z Ñ 0

be a short exact sequence in E, and let A be an object of E. Then there are exact sequences
/ Ext1pZ, Aq

/ HompX, Aq

/ HompZ, Aq

/ HompY, Aq

0

/ . . .

ExtnpX, Aq

/ Extn`1pZ, Aq

/ Ext1pA, Xq

/ . . .

ExtnpA, Zq

/ Extn`1pA, Xq

/ Extn`1pA, Y q

/ Extn`1pA, Zq

/ . . .

All the proofs for the above facts work as the abelian case. The interested reader can adapt the relevant

proofs in [Buc59] for example.
The ﬁrst ext group Ext1pA, Bq can also be computed by passing to a left abelianization. More generally we
have the following:

Proposition 2.43. Let E and F be exact categories. Let F : E Ñ F be a fully faithful exact functor which
reﬂects exactness. Suppose that the essential image of E is closed under extensions. Then F induces a
natural isomorphism of abelian groups

Proof. We deﬁne a map ExtEpX, Y q Ñ ExtF pFpXq, FpY qq by sending a short exact sequence

Ext1

Ep´,´q – Ext1

F pFp´q, Fp´qq

0 Ñ Y Ñ P Ñ X Ñ 0

to

0 Ñ FpY q Ñ FpPq Ñ FpXq Ñ 0

This map is easily seen to be well-deﬁned. Let us show that this map is onto. Suppose

0

/ FpY q

f

/ Q

g /

/ FpXq

/ 0

is exact. Since the essential image of F is closed under extensions there is some object P P E and an
isomorphism p : Q ˜ÑFpPq. Therefore we get a commutative diagram

Q

g

f

g

Now the bottom row is exact. Moreover, since F is fully faithful there is a unique f1 : Y Ñ P and a unique
g1 : P Ñ X such that p ˝ f “ Fpf1q and g ˝ p´1 “ Fpg1q. Since F reﬂects exactness

By construction there is a pre-equivalence

Hence the map is surjective.

Next let us show that the map is injective. Suppose that the short exact sequences

It remains to show that we have a map of abelian groups. However this follows from Proposition 2.8.
Remark 2.44. In the above we make the implicit assumption that each ExtnpA, Bq is a set. This always
holds for exact categories with enough projectives, which can be seen from the discussion in the following
section.

2.4. Projective Objects and Resolutions in Exact Categories. At this point we recall the notion of
a projective object in an exact category, and mention how they relate to the Ext functor.
Deﬁnition 2.45. An object P in an exact category E is said to be projective if the functor HompP,´q :
E Ñ Ab is exact.
Remark 2.46. By Proposition 2.25, for any projective object P the functor HompP,´q is admissibly exact.
Example 2.47. In the split exact structure every object is projective.

As in the abelian case one has the following result.

Proposition 2.48. The following are equivalent.

(1) P is projective.
(2) Given a map f : P Ñ C and an admissible epic e : B Ñ C, there is a morphism g : P Ñ B such

that the following diagram commutes

B

/ C

g

f

P

(3) Any admissible epic with codomain P splits.
(4) Ext1pP, Aq vanishes for any object A.
(5) ExtnpP, Aq vanishes for any object A and any n ě 1.
We will need some results about projective resolutions in exact categories later.

2.4.1. Bounded Resolutions.

Deﬁnition 2.49. An exact category E is said to have enough projectives if for any object X of E,there
is a projective object P and an admissible epimorphism P (cid:16) X.
Lemma 2.50. Let P be a subclass of ObpEq. Assume that for any object E of E there is an object P P P
and an admissible epimorphism P (cid:16) E. Then, for any bounded below complex E of Ch`pEq, there is a
bounded below complex P whose entries are objects of P, and a quasi-isomorphism

u : P Ñ E

where each uk : Pk Ñ Ek is an admissible epimorphism. Moreover, this construction can be made functorial
if the choice of admissible epimorphism P (cid:16) E can be made functorial.
Proof. This is proved in [B¨uh10] for the case that P is the class of projectives in an exact category with
(cid:3)
enough projectives. However the proof goes through the same.
Lemma 2.51. Let A, B be objects in an exact category E. Let f : A Ñ B be a morphism. Let P‚ be a
complex with P´1 “ A, Pn “ 0 for n ă ´1 and Pn projective for n ą 0. Also let Q‚ be an acyclic complex
with Q´1 “ B and Qn “ 0 for n ă ´1. Then there is a chain map f‚ : P‚ Ñ Q‚ with f´1 “ f . Moreover,
f‚ is unique up to homotopy.

Proof. See [B¨uh10] Theorem 12.4.

(cid:3)

As in the abelian case one can deﬁne derived functors between derived categories of exact categories. There
are also notions of adapted classes for functors. Proposition 2.48 and Lemma 2.50 essentially say that as in
the abelian case, if a category E has enough projectives, then the class of projective objects is adapted to the
functor Homp´, Aq : E op Ñ Ab. It can be shown that RnHomp´, Aq ..“ HnpRHomp´, Aqq – Extnp´, Aq.

2.4.2. Unbounded Resolutions. When dealing with the model structures on unbounded chain complexes., we
will also need to have unbounded resolutions. For this we will adapt the famous Theorem 3.4 in [Spa88]. In
the following we shall let B be a class of complexes in E which is stable under shifts, and we shall assume
that for any bounded below complex X‚ there is a bounded below complex B‚ in B and a quasi-isomorphism
B‚ Ñ X‚ which is an admissible epimorphism in each degree. We will call such a class a bounded resolving
class. Let us recall some notions from Splatenstein’s paper.

Deﬁnition 2.52. Let B be a class of complexes. A direct system pP n‚ qnPE in ChpEq is a B-special direct

system if it satisﬁes the following conditions.

(1) E is well-ordered.

(2) If n P E has no predecessor then P n‚ “ limÑmăn P m‚ .
(3) If n P E has a predecessor n ´ 1 then the natural chain map P n´1

C n‚ belongs to B, and the short exact sequence

0 Ñ P n´1

‚ Ñ P n‚ Ñ C n‚ Ñ 0

‚ Ñ P n‚ is injective, its cokernel

is split exact in each degree.

We denote by limÑB the class of complexes which are limits of B-special direct systems.
Proposition 2.53. Let E be an exact category which has kernels such that the functor limÑN is exact.
Suppose that B is a bounded resolving class. Then for any complex X‚ there exists a B-special direct system
pP n‚ qně´1 and a direct system of chain maps f n : P n‚ Ñ τěnX‚ such that

(1) f n is a quasi-isomorphism for every n ě 0.

(2) f n is an admissible epimorphism in each degree.

‚

and Y‚ “ τěnX‚. Denote by f the composite P n´1

Proof. We construct the data pP n‚ qně´1 and pf nqně´1 by induction. For n “ ´1 we take P ´1‚ “ 0 and
so f´1 “ 0. Let now n ě 1, and suppose that P ´1‚
and f´1, . . . , f n´1 have been constructed.
Let P‚ “ P n´1
‚ Ñ τěn´1X‚ Ñ Y‚. By assumption
we can ﬁnd a quasi-isomorphism g : Q‚ Ñ conepfqr1s which is an admissible epimorphism in each degree,
and Q‚r´1s P B. Now we have a degree wise splitting conepfqr1s “ P‚ ‘ Y‚r1s. We therefore get two maps
g1 : Q‚ Ñ P‚ and g2 : Q‚ Ñ Y‚r1s which are admissible epimorphisms in each degree, and such that g1 is a
chain map. Let hn : conep´g1qn “ Qr1sn ‘ Pn Ñ Yn be deﬁned by h “ g2r1s ` f . As in [Spa88], by direct
calculation h is a chain map and conephq “ conepgqr1s. Since g is a quasi-isomorphism h is as well. Moreover
the sequence

, . . . , P n´1

‚

0 Ñ P n´1

‚ Ñ P n‚ Ñ Q‚r1s Ñ 0

21

(cid:3)

is split exact in each degree.
Corollary 2.54. Let E be an exact category with kernels in which the direct limit functor limÑN exists and
is exact. Let B be a bounded resolving class. Then any chain complex X‚ in E admits a limÑB resolution
which is an admissible epimorphism in each degree.
Proof. Fix a B-special direct system pP n‚ qně´1 and a direct system of chain maps f n : P n‚ Ñ τěnX‚ such

that

(1) f n is a quasi-isomorphism for every n ě 0.

(2) f n is an admissible epimorphism in each degree.

Let P‚ be the direct limit of the special direct system. For each n the composition P n‚ Ñ P‚ Ñ X‚ is an
admissible epimorphism in degrees ą n. Thus P‚ Ñ X‚ is an admissible epimorphism in all degrees.
(cid:3)
Now let P be any class of objects in E. Suppose that for each object X in E there is an object P in P
together with an admissible epimorphism P (cid:16) X. By Lemma 2.50 the class Ch`pPq of chain complexes
with entries in P is a bounded resolving class. Let us introduce the following notion.
Deﬁnition 2.55. Let E be an exact category such that for some ordinal λ, λ-indexed transﬁnite compositions
of admissible monomorphisms exist. We say that a class of objects P in E is closed under λ-indexed
extensions if for any continuous functor X : λ Ñ E functor such that for each i ă j in λ the map Xi Ñ Xj
is an admissible monic whose cokernel is in P, then the limit Xλ is in P.

From the proof of Corollary 2.54 we then immediately have the following.

Corollary 2.56. Let E be an exact category with kernels in which the direct limit functor limÑN exists and
is exact. Let P be a class of objects such that for each object X in E there is an object P in P together with
an admissible epimorphism P (cid:16) X. Suppose further that P is closed under N-indexed extensions. Then for
any complex X‚ in ChpEq there is a complex P‚ in ChpPq and an admissible epimorphism P‚ Ñ X‚ which
is a quasi-isomorphism. Moreover, X‚ is the limit of a Ch`pPq-special direct system.

We will also need the following acyclicity result, also proved in [Spa88] for abelian categories.

Proposition 2.57. Let T be a class of complexes in ChpEq. The class of all complexes A‚ P ChpEq such
that HompA‚, T‚q is acyclic for every T‚ in T is closed under special direct limits.
Proof. It is clear from the deﬁnition of the contravariant functor Homp´, T‚q that it transforms colimits
into limits. If pP n‚ qnPE is a B-special direct system then pHompP n‚ , T‚qqnPE is a B-special inverse system of
acyclic complexes of abelian groups, where we use the terminology of [Spa88]. Lemma 2.3 in [Spa88] says
(cid:3)
that the inverse limit of such a system is again acyclic.

2.5. Diagrams in Exact Categories. In this subsection we study exact structures on categories of di-
agrams in exact categories, in particular chain complexes in exact categories. Let J , C be categories. For
each pair of morphisms f, g P J such that f ˝ g is well-deﬁned, let Mpf,gq be a full subcategory of the arrow
category MorpCq. Write M “ tMpf,gq : f ˝ g is well-deﬁnedu. Denote by rJ , CsM the full subcategory of
the functor category rJ , Cs consisting of functors G satisfying Gpf ˝ gq P Mpf,gq for each pair of morphisms

22

JACK KELLY

f, g P J such that f ˝ g is well-deﬁned. The proof of the following proposition is straight-forward diagram
chasing.
Proposition 2.58. Let I be a category and F : I Ñ rJ , CsM be a diagram. Denote its value on an
object i P I by Fp´qi. Then a (co)limit of F exists if for each object j P J the (co)limit of the functor
Fpjq : I Ñ C exists, and for each pair of composable morphisms f, g in J , the (co)limit of the functor
Fpf ˝ gq : I Ñ MorpCq exists in MorpCq and is contained in Mpf,gq. Moreover, the (co)limit is then given
on objects by j ÞÑ (co)limiPI Fpjqi and on morphisms by g ÞÑ (co)limiPI Fpgqi
Corollary 2.59. Let pE,Qq be an exact category and J a small category. Let M be as above. Suppose that
for each pair of composable morphisms f, g P J , Mpf,gq is an additive subcategory of MorpEq which is closed
under taking ﬁnite limits and ﬁnite colimits in MorpEq . Then rJ , EsM is an additive category, and the class
of kernel-cokernel pairs QJ ,M on rJ , EsM deﬁned by pi : A Ñ B, p : B Ñ Cq P QJ ,M if and only if for each
j P ObpJq, pipjq : Apjq Ñ Bpjq, ppjq : Bpjq Ñ Cpjqq P Q deﬁnes an exact structure on rJ , EsM. Moreover if
E is quasi-abelian or abelian then so is rJ , EsM
Proof. Diagram categories in pre-additive categories are pre-additive in a natural way. Clearly any full
subcategory of a pre-additive category is pre-additive. Thus to show that rJ , EsM is additive it remains to
demonstrate that it has ﬁnite biproducts. This follows from the previous proposition.
Let us show that a morphism p : B Ñ C is an admissible epic in rJ , EsM if and only if each ppjq is an
admissible epic in E. It is clear that if p is an admissible epic then so is each ppjq. Now let p be a morphism
such that for each j P J , ppjq : Bpjq Ñ Cpjq is an admisible epic. By Proposition 2.58 the kernel of p exists.
Let us denote it by i : A Ñ B. Moreover for each j P J , ipjq : Apjq Ñ Bpjq is a kernel of ppjq : Bpjq Ñ Cpjq
and hence is an admissible monic. Thus p : B Ñ C is an admissible epic. Likewise if i : A Ñ B is such that
ipjq is an admissible monic in Q for all j P J , then i is an admissible monic in QJ ,M.

It is clear now the class of admissible epics and the class of admissible monics contain isomorphisms
and are closed under composition. By Proposition 2.58, pushouts are deﬁned object wise. It then follows
from the previous remarks that pushouts of admissible monics are admissible monics. Likewise pullbacks of
admissible epics are admissible epics.
For the last statement we use the criterion of Remark 2.81 (see later). Note that the condition of a
morphism in rJ , EsM being weakly admissible is an object wise one. In particular if E is quasi-abelian then
every morphism in E is weakly admissible, then so is every morphism in rJ , EsM. Thus rJ , EsM is also
quasi-abelian. Noting that the property of a morphism being admissible is also an object-wise one, we see
similarly that rJ , EsM is abelian whenever E is.
(cid:3)

Our main example is the category of chain complexes in an exact category.

Example 2.60. Regard Z as a poset, and consider the category Zop. Denote the morphism n Ñ n ´ 1 in
Zop by rns. Let E be a pre-additive category, and for each integer n, let Mrns,rn´1s be the full subcategory of
MorpEq consisting of the zero morphisms. Note that this uniquely determines the categories Mf,g for any
pair of composable morphisms f, g in J . Then there is an isomorphism of categories

ChpEq – rZop, EsM

The admissible monomorphisms (resp. epimorphisms) are the morphisms of chain complexes which are
admissible monomorphisms (resp. epimorphisms) in each degree. Note also that for ˚ P tě 0,ď 0,`,´, bu,
the categories Ch˚pEq are full extension-closed subcategories of ChpEq. Thus they inherit exact structures.
Again the admissible monomorphisms (resp. epimorphisms) are the morphisms of chain complexes which
are admissible monomorphisms (resp. epimorphisms) in each degree.

It is now easy to construct a left abelianization of Ch˚pEq, given a left abelianization I : E Ñ A of E.

Proposition 2.61. Let F : A Ñ B be a fully faithful exact functor which reﬂects exactness and whose
essential image is closed under extensions. Then for ˚ P tě 0,ď 0,`,´, b,Hu the induced functor

Ch˚pFq : Ch˚pAq Ñ Ch˚pBq

is a fully faithful exact functor which reﬂects exactness and whose essential image is closed under extensions.

23

Proof. Since exactness of chain complexes is deﬁned level wise, Ch˚pFq is clearly exact and reﬂects exactness.
It is clearly faithful. Let us check that it is full. Let pX‚, d‚q and pY‚, δ‚q be chain complexes in A. Let
f‚ : FpX‚q Ñ FpY‚q be a chain map. For each n there is some gn : Xn Ñ Yn with fn “ Fpgnq. Moreover

Fpgn ˝ dn`1q “ Fpgnq ˝ Fpdn`1q “ fn ˝ Fpdn`1q “ Fpδn`1q ˝ fn`1 “ Fpδn`1 ˝ gn`1q

Since F is faithful, gn ˝ dn`1 “ δn`1 ˝ gn`1. It remains to show that the essential image of Ch˚pFq is closed
under extensions. So suppose we have an exact sequence of chain complexes.

0

/ FpX‚, d‚q

f‚

/ pQ‚, γ‚q

g‚

/ FpY‚, δ‚q

/ 0

For each n pick an object Pn P A and an isomorphism pn : Qn ˜ÑFpPnq. Let γ1
n “ pn´1 ˝ γn ˝ p´1
FpPnq Ñ FpPn´1q. Then pP‚, γ1‚q is a chain complex. Moreover by construction we have an isomorphism
p‚ : Q‚ Ñ FpP‚q whose nth component is pn.
(cid:3)
Corollary 2.62. Let I : E Ñ ApEq is a left abelianization of E. Then Ch˚pIq : Ch˚pEq Ñ Ch˚pApEqq is
a left abelianization of Ch˚pEq.
Proof. By the previous proposition, it remains to check that ChpIq preserves kernels, and ChpIqpf‚q is an
admissible epimorphism if and only if f‚ is. However this is clear since everything is computed degree-
(cid:3)
wise.

2.5.1. A Useful Example: The Degree-wise Split structure. Let E be an additive category, and endow it with
the split exact structure. The induced exact structure on ChpEq is called the degree-wise split exact
structure, and we denote the ext functors in this structure by Extn
dw. We conclude this section with a
brief discussion of the relation between extensions in the degree-wise split exact structure and the ChpAbq-
enriched structure on ChpEq. This is also done in a model theoretic context for modules over a ring in
[Gil11].

Proposition 2.63. A sequence of chain complexes 0
each degree if and only if it is isomorphic to a complex of the form
0 Ñ X‚ Ñ conepf‚q Ñ Y‚ Ñ 0

for some morphism of complexes f‚ : Y‚r1s Ñ X‚.
Proof. The sequence

p‚

q‚

that qn ˝ βn “ idYn . We may assume also that αn ˝ βn “ 0. Deﬁne f‚ : Y‚r1s Ñ X‚ by fn “ αn ˝ dZ
This is easily seen to be a map of chain complexes. Let αn : Zn Ñ Xn ‘ Yn denote the isomorphism induced
by the degree-wise splitting. A straight-forward computation shows that this gives a map of chain complexes
α‚ : Z‚ Ñ conepf‚q. Thus we get an isomorphism of exact sequences.

Proposition 2.64. A map of chain complexes f‚ : X‚ Ñ Y‚ is homotopic to 0 if and only if the sequence

0 Ñ Y‚ Ñ conepf‚q Ñ X‚r´1s Ñ 0

is split exact.
Proof. Suppose that f‚ is homotopic to 0. Let tDn : Xn Ñ Yn`1u be a homotopy. We then get a map
αn “ pidXn´1, Dn´1q : Xn´1 Ñ conepfqn.
It is straight-forward to check that this gives a chain map
α‚ : X‚r´1s Ñ conepf‚q. Moreover it obviously gives a splitting of conepf‚q Ñ X‚r´1s.
Conversely suppose the sequence is split exact. Let α‚ : X‚r´1s Ñ conepf‚q be a splitting of the map
conepf‚q Ñ X‚r´1s. It is an easy computation to check that the collection of compositions tDn´1 : Xn´1 Ñ
conepf‚qn Ñ Ynu is a homotopy between f and 0.

2.6. Monoidal Exact Categories and Monads in Exact Categories. We conclude this section with a
brief note on monoidal exact categories, and exact structures on categories of modules over monoids. More
generally we put an exact structure on the category of algebras for an additive monad which is compatible
in a precise sense with the exact structure on the underlying category. First we need a general deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 2.66. A covariant functor F : E Ñ F between exact categories is said to be right exact if for
any short exact sequence

0 Ñ X Ñ Y Ñ Z Ñ 0

in E, the sequence

FpXq Ñ FpY q Ñ FpZq Ñ 0

is admissibly coacyclic in F .
A contravariant functor F : E Ñ F between exact categories is said to be right exact if for any short
exact sequence

0 Ñ X Ñ Y Ñ Z Ñ 0

in E, the sequence

is admissibly coacyclic in F .

Dually one deﬁnes left exactness.

FpZq Ñ FpY q Ñ FpXq Ñ 0

Deﬁnition 2.67. Let E be an exact category. A symmetric monoidal structure with additive tensor functor
b is said to be compatible if for any object X of E the functor X b p´q preserves all colimits which exist
and is right exact. A monoidal exact category is a symmetric monoidal category pE,b, kq where E is an
exact category and the monoidal structure is compatible.

25

Deﬁnition 2.68. Let E be an exact category. A closed symmetric monoidal structure with additive tensor
functor b and additive internal hom Hom is said to be compatible with E if for each object X of E,
the functor X b p´q, is right exact and the functors HompA,´q and Homp´, Aq are left exact. A closed
monoidal exact category is a closed monoidal category pE,b, Hom, kq where E is an exact category and
the closed monoidal structure is compatible.

Note that if pE,b, Hom, kq is a closed monoidal exact category, then pE,b, kq is automatically a monoidal

exact category. Indeed for each object X, X b p´q is a left adjoint so it preserves colimits.
Deﬁnition 2.69. Let pE,b, kq be an exact category equipped with a (not necessarily compatible) symmetric
monoidal structure where the tensor functor is additive. An object F of E is said to be (strongly) ﬂat if
the functor F b p´q is (strongly) exact.

In the familiar category of R-modules over some ring R with the usual monoidal structure, projectives are
always ﬂat. Moreover the tensor product of two projective R-modules is again projective. This is not always
guaranteed for an arbitrary monoidal exact category. However it is a useful property to have, in particular
when dealing with the projective model structure later. We therefore make a deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 2.70. A monoidal exact category in which projective objects are ﬂat and P b P 1 is projective
whenever both P and P 1 are is said to be projectively monoidal . A projectively monoidal exact category
is said to be strongly projectively monoidal if projectives are strongly ﬂat.

In closed exact categories we have the following observation.

Observation 2.71. Let pE,b, k, Homq be a closed monoidal exact category with enough projectives such
that the underlying monoidal category is projectively monoidal. Then for any projective P , the functor
HompP,´q : E Ñ E is exact. The proof follows immediately from the adjunction between b and Hom. It is
shown in the quasi-abelian case in [Sch99], for example, and the proof works identically in the exact case.
Now let R be a unital associative monoid internal to a monoidal exact category pE,b, kq. It turns out

that there is an exact structure on the additive category R ´ Mod where a null sequence

0 Ñ X Ñ Y Ñ Z Ñ 0

in R ´ Mod is exact if and only if it is a short exact sequence when regarded as a null-sequence in E. This
follows from a more general result about compatible monads in exact categories.

Deﬁnition 2.72. An additive monad T on an exact category E is said to be compatible if it preserves all
colimits and is a right exact functor.
Proposition 2.73. Let E be an exact category and let T : E Ñ E be a compatible monad. There is an exact
structure on E T where a null sequence

0 Ñ X Ñ Y Ñ Z Ñ 0

in E T is exact if and only if it is a short exact sequence when regarded as a null-sequence in E. We call this
exact structure the induced exact structure.

Proof. This follows from the general fact that if T is a cocontinuous monad on any category E then the
forgetful functor E T Ñ E creates limits and colimits and reﬂects isomorphisms. For a proof see [Bor94]
(cid:3)
Proposition 4.3.1 and Proposition 4.3.2.

This exact structure inherits a lot from the exact structure on E. In fact we have the following lemma.
Lemma 2.74. Let | ´ | : D Ñ E be a functor between exact categories which reﬂects exactness and creates
both kernels and cokernels. Then | ´ | reﬂects admissible monomorphisms, admissible epimorphisms, weakly
admissible morphisms, admissible morphisms, and admissibly acyclic sequences.

26

JACK KELLY

Proof. Let f : X Ñ Y be a morphism in D. Supposethat |f| is an admissible monomorphism. Then there is
an exact sequence

Since | ´ | creates cokernels and reﬂects exactness

0 Ñ |X| Ñ |Y | Ñ Cokerp|f|q Ñ 0

0 Ñ X Ñ Y Ñ Cokerpfq Ñ 0

is an exact sequence in D. Thus f is an admissible monomorphism. That |´| reﬂects admissible epimorphisms
is proved similarly. Note in particular that this means | ´ | reﬂects isomorphisms.

Suppose now that |f| : |X| Ñ |Y | is weakly admissible. Then there is a decomposition

|X|

|f|

/ |Y |

Kerp|f|q;

Coimp|f|q

ˆ|f|

/ Imp|f|q;

Cokerp|f|q

Since | ´ | reﬂects exactness and creates both kernels and cokernels there is a decomposition in D

X

f

/ Y

Kerpfq;

Coimpfq

ˆf

/ Impfq<

Cokerpfq

Thus f is weakly admissible. If in addition |f| is admissible then | ˆf| is an isomorphism. Since | ´ | reﬂects
isomorphisms ˆf is an isomorphism, so f is admissible.

Finally suppose

|X|

|g|

/ |Z|

|f|

/ |Y |

is admissibly acyclic. Then |f| is admissible, |g| has a kernel and the map Imp|f|q Ñ Kerp|g|q is an isomor-
phism. By the above f is admissible. Since |´| creates kernels and cokernels and also reﬂects isomorphisms
Impfq Ñ Kerpgq is also an isomorphism.
(cid:3)

As a consequence of this and Remark 2.81 later, if E is (quasi)-abelian, then so is E T . In particular cate-
gories of modules for monoid objects in monoidal (quasi)-abelian categories are themselves (quasi)-abelian.

Before concluding this discussion of monoidal exact categories, let us brieﬂy mention induced monoidal
structures on chain complexes. So, let pE,b, kq be a monoidal exact category. Recall from Section 1 there
is an induced additive monoidal structure pCh˚pEq,b, S0pkqq on Ch˚pEq for ˚ P tě 0,ď 0,`,´, b,Hu.
Since colimits of chain complexes are computed degreewise, ﬁnite direct sums are strongly exact, and a
null-sequence of chain complexes is admissibly coacyclic if and only if it is so in each degree, it is clear
that this monoidal structure is compatible, so that pCh˚pEq,b, S0pkqq is a monoidal exact category for
˚ P tě 0,ď 0,`,´, bu.

Now suppose pE,b, S0pkq, Homq is a closed monoidal exact category. Then

is a closed monoidal exact category. Note that the closed symmetric monoidal category

pChbpEq,b, S0pkq, Homq

pChpEq,b, S0pkq, Homq

need not be a closed monoidal exact category since inﬁnite direct sums/ products need not be admissibly
coexact/ admissibly exact. When we deal with unbounded complexes later we shall assume this to be the
case. We shall see shortly that this is guaranteed for a closed monoidal structure on a quasi-abelian category.

2.7. Quasi-Abelian Categories. Let us apply what we have seen so far to the particular case of quasi-
abelian categories. The theory of quasi-abelian categories is developed signiﬁcantly in [Sch99] which is our
main reference here. Applications to categories of topological vector spaces can be found in [Pro00].

2.7.1. Strict Morphisms. First we show that Deﬁnition 2.5 is equivalent to the one given in [Sch99]. Recall
that in a ﬁnitely bicomplete additive category, any morphism f : E Ñ F gives rise to a commutative diagram

27

E

f

F

Coimpfq

/ Imf

L
L
In any abelian category the map Coimpfq Ñ Impfq is an isomorphism. However this is not true in general.
For example, consider the standard example of the category Fr of Fr´echet spaces. Then Coimpfq “ E
f´1p0q,
Impfq “ fpEq and the natural map E
f´1p0q Ñ fpEq is the obvious one. By the Open Mapping Theorem
Coimpfq Ñ Impfq is an isomorphism if and only if f has closed range, which is not always the case.
Deﬁnition 2.75. Let E be an additive category with all kernels and cokernels. A morphism f : E Ñ F in
E is said to be strict if Coimpfq Ñ Impfq is an isomorphism.
Proposition 2.76. Let E be a ﬁnitely bicomplete additive category.

(1) A monic is strict if and only if it is the kernel of some morphism. In this case it is the kernel of its

cokernel.

(2) An epic is strict if and only if it is the cokernel some morphism. In this case it is the cokernel of its

kernel.

Proof.

(1) Let f : E Ñ F and write if : Kerpfq Ñ E for the canonical map. Let us show that if is
strict. First note that for any monic A Ñ B, the coimage is id : A Ñ A. Let us compute the image
of if . It is given by

KerpCokerpKerpfq Ñ Eq Ñ E

By some abstract nonsense this is just Kerpfq Ñ E.

Conversely suppose m : X Ñ E is a strict monic. Then the maps E Ñ Coimpmq Ñ Impmq are

all isomorphisms, i.e. we get a commutative diagram
/ E

m

X
„

Since Impmq Ñ E is a kernel of Cokerpmq, so is m : X Ñ E.

Coimpmq „ /

/ Impmq

(2) This is dual to the ﬁrst part.

Proposition 2.77. The class of strict epics (resp. monics) of E is stable by composition.

Proof. See [Sch99] Proposition 1.1.7.

A

is a pullback diagram, and f is a strict epic, then f1 is as well.

Let us now describe the admissible morphisms in the quasi-abelian exact structure.

Proposition 2.79. Let E be a ﬁnitely bicomplete additive category. A morphism f : E Ñ F in E is strict
if and only if it can be written as f “ i ˝ p where p : E Ñ I is a strict epic and i : I Ñ F is a strict monic.
Proof. Suppose f admits a decomposition f “ i ˝ p as in the statement. Then Kerpfq “ Kerppq. So
Coimpfq “ Coimppq. Since p is strict Coimppq – Imppq. Since p is an epic, Imppq “ I. Similarly Impfq “
Impiq “ I.
Conversely suppose f is a strict morphism. Now E Ñ Coimpfq is a strict epic, and Impfq Ñ F is a strict
monic. But since f is strict, Coimpfq – Impfq, so this gives the decomposition of f .
(cid:3)

We immediately get:

Corollary 2.80. A morphism in a quasi-abelian category is admissible in the quasi-abelian exact structure
if and only if it is strict.

Remark 2.81. An exact structure on a ﬁnitely bicomplete additive category coincides with the quasi-abelian
structure if and only if every morphism is weakly admissible. Then as a consequence of Proposition 2.76, a
ﬁnitely bicomplete additive category is abelian if and only if every morphism is admissible.

2.7.2. The Left Heart. Homology in quasi-abelian is signiﬁcantly easier than in more general exact categories.
For example, there is an even stronger abelian embedding.
Theorem 2.82. Let E be a quasi-abelian category. There exists a left abelianization I : E Ñ LH pEq of E
such that I has a left adjoint C : LH pEq Ñ E with C ˝ I – idE , i.e. E is a reﬂective subcategory of LH pEq.
Moreover the induced functor on derived categories

DpIq : DpEq Ñ DpLH pEqq

is an equivalence.

Proof. See [Sch99] Proposition 1.1.26, Corollary 1.2.27, Proposition 1.2.28, and Proposition 1.2.31.

(cid:3)
LH pEq is called the left heart of E. The embedding of E into its left heart also behaves extremely well

with respect to projectives, namely:

Proposition 2.83.

(1) An object P of E is projective if and only if IpPq is projective in LH pEq.

(2) E has enough projectives if and only if LH pEq has enough projectives.

LH pEq is projective if and only if it is isomorphic to IpPq where P is projective in E.

In this case an object of

Moreover left abelianizations of quasi-abelian categories allow us to test acyclicity of any unbounded

complex. Indeed as a consequence of Remark 2.81 and Corollary 2.30 we get.
Corollary 2.84. Let I : E Ñ A be a left abelianisation of E where E is a quasi-abelian category. Then a
complex X‚ in E is acyclic if and only if IpX‚q is acyclic. In particular a map of complexes f : X Ñ Y is a
quasi-isomorphism if and only if Ipfq is.
2.7.3. Monoidal Quasi-Abelian Categories. Let us brieﬂy discuss (strongly) projectively monoidal quasi-
abelian categories, i.e. a (strongly) projectively monoidal exact category in which the underlying exact
category is quasi-abelian. We ﬁrst make the following observation.
Observation 2.85. An additive functor F : E Ñ F between quasi-abelian categories is right exact if and
only if it preserves cokernels of strict morphisms.

This implies that if pE,b, kq is a monoidal category with E quasi-abelian and b additive, then it is a
monoidal quasi-abelian category if and only if Xbp´q preserves colimits for each object X of E. In particular
if pE,b, Hom, kq is a closed monoidal category with E quasi-abelian and b, Hom additive functors, then
pE,b, Hom, kq is in fact a closed monoidal quasi-abelian category.
Proposition 2.86. Let pE,b, Hom, kq be a bicomplete closed monoidal quasi-abelian category which is also
projectively monoidal. Then there is a monoidal structure ˜b, ˜Hom on LH pEq such that pLH pEq, ˜b, ˜Hom, Ipkqq
is a closed monoidal abelian category. Moreover I : E Ñ LH pEq is a lax monoidal functor. If pE,b, Hom, kq
is strongly projectively monoidal then pLH pEq, ˜b, ˜Hom, Ipkqq is projectively monoidal.
Proof. See [Sch99] Proposition 1.5.3 and Corollary 1.5.4.

3. Generators in Exact Categories

In this section we will introduce suitable notions of a generating set in an exact category. This will
come into play later when we discuss coﬁbrant generation of model structures, where some compactness
assumptions are required. For our deﬁnition of generating set we will generalise an equivalent characterisation
([Sch99] Proposition 2.1.7) of Schneiders’ notion of a strictly generating set in a quasi-abelian caegory,
[Sch99] Deﬁnition 2.1.5. If G is a collection of objects in an exact category we denote by
G the collection
of all small coproducts of objects in G.
Deﬁnition 3.1. A collection of objects G in an exact category E is said to be an admissible generating
G and an admissible epimorphism Q (cid:16) E. An
set if for each object E of E there is an object Q of
admissible generating set G is said to be a projective generating set if all objects in G are projective.

The next two results are adaptations of the proof of [Sch99] Proposition 1.3.23 to the exact case.

Proposition 3.2. Let G be an admissible generating set. Suppose f : E Ñ F is a morphism such that for
each G in G then map HompG, Eq Ñ HompG, Fq is an epimorphism. Then f is an admissible epimorphism.
Proof. Pick an admissible epimorphism  : P Ñ F where P P
G. By assumption there is a morphism
1 : P Ñ E such that  “ f ˝ 1. By Proposition 2.9 f is then an admissible epimorphism.
(cid:3)
Proposition 3.3. Let G be a generating set in an exact category E. A complex

with e2 weakly left admissible is admissibly acyclic if and only if for each P P P the sequence

HompP, E1q

/ HompP, Eq

/ HompP, E2q

is acyclic in Ab.
Proof. Suppose that for each G P G the sequence

0

/ HompG, E1q

/ HompG, Eq

/ HompG, E2q

is acyclic in Ab. Since e2 is weakly left admissible it is suﬃcient to show that e1 is a kernel of e2. Then e1 is
automatically an admissible monic. To show this one can follow the proof in [Sch99]. At one point in that
proof the existence of a resolution of X by objects of ‘G is used. Here instead we may use Lemma 2.50

Finally let us consider the assertion about projective generators. Proposition 2.25 implies that

HompP, E1q

/ HompP, Eq

/ HompP, E2q

is acyclic. For the converse ﬁrst consider the sequence
/ Kerpe2q

/ E e2
Since HompP,´q preserves kernels, Proposition 3.2 implies that
/ E2

/ E e2

E e1

is admissibly acyclic.

/ E2

(cid:3)

In particular if E is quasi-abelian, then every morphism is weakly admissible, so in this case one has that

a sequence

/ E2
is admissibly acyclic if and only if for each P P P the sequence

/ E e2

E e1

HompP, E1q

/ HompP, Eq

/ HompP, E2q
is acyclic in Ab. For general exact categories we still have the following result.
Corollary 3.4. Let G be a projective generating set in an exact category E. Let X‚ be a complex. Suppose
that X‚ is good. Then X‚ is acyclic if and only if HompG, X‚q is acyclic for each G P G.
Proof. Since each G P G is projective the functors HompG,´q preserve acyclic complexes.
Conversely suppose HompG, X‚q is acyclic for each G P G, and dX
HompG, d1
n`1 : Xn`1 Ñ ZnX is an admissible epimorphism. Now apply Proposition 2.29.

3.1. Elementary Exact Categories. It is convenient to have generators satisfying some smallness condi-
tions. We will use the same terminology as Schneiders does in [Sch99] for quasi-abelian cateogries.

n has a kernel ZnX. By assumption
n`1q : HompG, Xn`1q Ñ ZnHompG, Xq “ HompG, ZnXq is an epimorphism for each n. Thus

(1) projectively generated if it has a projective generating set

(2) quasi-elementary if it has a projective generating set consisting of small objects.

(3) elementary if it has a projective generating set consisting of tiny objects.

Proposition 3.7. A cocomplete quasi-abelian category is (quasi)-elementary if and only if its left heart is
(quasi)-elementary.

Proof. See [Sch99] Proposition 2.1.12.

(cid:3)

The following proposition is immediate from Proposition 3.3 and Corollary 3.4 but it has a useful conse-

quence.

Proposition 3.8. Let E be a cocomplete elementary(resp. quasi-elementary) exact category. Then ﬁltering
inductive limits (resp. direct sums) in E are exact.
If in addition E is quasi-abelian elementary (resp.
quasi-elementary), then ﬁltering inductive limits (resp. direct sums) are admissibly exact.

Proposition 3.9. Let E be a cocomplete exact category in which the direct limit functor is exact. Then
transﬁnite compositions of admissible monics are admissible monics.

Proof. Since ﬁnite compositions of admissible monics are admissible, the successor case is clear. For the
limit case let Λ be a limit ordinal, and consider the commutative diagram

with short exact columns. Taking the direct limit over Λ, we get a short exact sequence

0 Ñ E0 Ñ E Ñ C Ñ 0

In particular E0 Ñ E is admissible.
3.2. Generators in Categories of Chain Complexes. Our goal now is to show that if E is an elementary
exact category then so is Ch˚pEq, for ˚ P t`,ď 0,´, b,ě 0,Hu. Much of this is based on the following
technical result.
Lemma 3.10. Let E be a weakly idempotent complete exact category. For any object C P E and X, Y P
ChpEq we have

(1) HomEpC, Ynq – HomChpEqpDnpCq, Y q

(7) Let X be a complex such that KerdX

n exists. Then there is a monic

Ext1pC, KerpdX
If X is acyclic then this is an isomorphism.

(8) Let X be a complex such that CokerpdX
Ext1pCokerpdX

n`1q exists. Then there is a monic
n`1q, Cq ãÑ Ext1pX, SnCq

If X is acyclic then this is an isomorphism.

Proof. By Proposition 2.43 and Proposition 2.62 it is suﬃcent to prove statements 1 ´ 3, 5, 6, 7 under the
assumption that E is abelian. In this context the result is Lemma 3.1 in [Gil04] and Lemma 4.2 in [Gil08].
Statement 4 is dual to to 3, and statement 8 is dual to 7.
(cid:3)

Remark 3.11. It is possible to prove most of this lemma internally in an exact category without passing to
an abelianisation.

At this point we can prove the following lemma. It provides one of our main applications of generating

sets, namely a convenient method for testing acyclicity. It is a modiﬁcation of Lemma 3.7 in [Gil07].
Lemma 3.12. Let E be an exact category with a set of generators G. Let X be a chain complex. Suppose
that X‚ is good. If for every G P G each map f : SnpGq Ñ X extends to Dn`1pGq, then X is acyclic.
Proof. By Proposition 2.29 it is enough to show that whenever dm has a kernel, the induced map

d1 : Xm`1 Ñ ZmX

is an admissible epic. For this it is enough to show that for each G P G,

is surjective, i.e. that any map f : G Ñ ZmX lifts to a diagram

HompG, d1q : HompG, Xm`1q Ñ HompG, ZmXq

Xm`1
d1

G

f

ZnX

But this is equivalent to showing that the chain map SnpGq Ñ X induced by f extends to a morphism
Dn`1pGq Ñ X.
(cid:3)

Next we characterise projective objects in categories of chain complexes. It is well known that projective
objects in the category of chain complexes in an abelian category are precisely the split exact complexes with
projective entries. See for example [Hov07] Proposition 2.3.10. We generalise the result to exact categories.
Proposition 3.13. Let E be a weakly idempotent complete exact category, and let ˚ P tě 0,ď 0,`,´, b,Hu.
Then split exact complexes of projectives are projective objects in Ch˚pEq. In addition, if P is projective in
E then S0pPq is projective in Chě0pEq.
Conversely, if a complex X‚ is a projective in Ch˚pEq for ˚ P t`,´, b,ě 0,ď 0,Hu then every Xn is
projective. Moreover, if ˚ P t`,´, b,Hu and X‚ is good then X‚ is a split exact complex of projective objects
of E. In particular if E has all kernels then the projective objects in Ch˚pEq, for ˚ P t`,´, b,Hu are precisely
the split exact complexes of projectives contained in Ch˚pEq.

Proof. By Lemma 3.10, split exact complexes of projectives are projective objects in Ch˚pEq for ˚ P
t`,´, b,ě 0,ď 0,Hu. Let us show that S0pPq is a projective object in Chě0pEq whenever P is projec-
tive in E. Indeed in this case, Lemma 3.10 implies that HomChpEqpS0pPq, Y‚q – HomEpP, Y0q. Since P is
projective, S0pPq is as well.

Conversely if a complex X‚ is a projective complex, then it follows immediately from Lemma 3.10 that
each Xn is projective in E. Suppose that ˚ P t`,´, b,Hu and that X‚ is good. Let P be the cone of the
identity id : X‚ Ñ X‚. Consider the surjection P Ñ X‚r´1s. Since X‚r´1s is projective this map splits by
Proposition 2.48. The second factor of this splitting gives a homotopy between idX‚r´1s and the 0 map. By
Corollary 2.36, X‚r´1s is acyclic so X‚ is as well.
(cid:3)
We can now show that Ch˚pEq has enough projectives. (This is well known for ChpAq with A abelian.

See for example [Wei95] Exercise 2.2.2).
Corollary 3.14. Let E be an exact category with enough projectives. Then Ch˚pEq has enough projectives
for ˚ P t`,´, b,ď 0,ě 0,Hu
Proof. By Proposition 3.13 DnpPq is projective in Ch˚pEq for ˚ P t`,´, b,Hu whenever P is projective.
À
Also DnpPq for n ď 0 is projective in Chď0pEq. Let X‚ P Ch˚pEq for ˚ P t`,´, b,ď 0,Hu. For each n pick
a projective Pn and an admissible epimorphism Pn (cid:16) Xn. This induces a map DnpPnq Ñ X‚ which is an
admissible epimorphism in degree n. Let P‚ “
n DnpPnq. By the above discussion we have an admissible
epimorphism P‚ (cid:16) X‚.
Now let X‚ P Chě0pEq. For n ą 0 the object DnpPq is projective in Chě0pEq. S0pPq is also projective
in Chě0pEq. For n ą 0, as before there is a projective object Pn and a morphism DnpPnq Ñ X‚ which is an
admissible epimorphism in degree n. For n “ 0 pick a projective object P0 and an admissible epimorphism
P0 Ñ X0. Since X´1 “ 0, this induces a map S0pP0q Ñ X‚ which is an admissible epimorphism in degree
0. Let P‚ “

‘ S0pP0q. Then we have an admissible epimorphism P‚ (cid:16) X‚.

´À
¯
ną0 DnpPnq

(cid:3)

We have essentially shown that Ch˚pEq has a set of projective generators whenever E does.

Corollary 3.15. Suppose P is a set of admissible generators for an exact category E. Then D˚pPq “
tDnpPq : P P P, n P ZuX Ch˚pEq is a set of generators for Ch˚pEq and ˚ P t`,´, b,ď 0,Hu. For ˚ P tě 0u,
˜D˚pPq ..“ D˚pPq Y tS0pPq : P P Pu is a set of generators for Ch˚pEq. They are projective generating sets
if P is.
Proof. The proof of Corollary 3.14 shows that the sets in the statement of the proposition are admissible
(cid:3)
generating sets. Proposition 3.13 establishes the second assertion.
We are nearly ready to show that Ch˚pEq is elementary for ˚ P t`,ě 0,ď 0,´, b,Hu. It remains to

identify some tiny objects in diagram categories.
Proposition 3.16. Let E be an additive category, J a small directed set such that for each pair of objects
j, j1 in J Hompj, j1q is ﬁnite (note it can be empty). Let M be as in the statement of Corollary 2.59. Let
X P rJ , EsM be such that Xpjq is tiny for all j, and Xpjq “ 0 for all but ﬁnitely many j. Then X is a tiny
object in rJ , EsM.
Proof. Let F : I Ñ rJ , EsM be a ﬁltering inductive system. Denote the limit by L. Then Lpjq “ limÑI Fpjq.

We have the commutative diagram

both columns are still exact.

Both the middle and bottom horizontal maps are isomorphisms because there are only ﬁnitely many non-zero
Xj and they are tiny. Since both columns are exact, the top horizontal map must be an isomorphism as
(cid:3)
well.

As a consequence we have

Corollary 3.17. Let E be an elementary exact category. Then Ch˚pEq is elementary for ˚ P t`,ď 0,ě
0,´, b,Hu.
Proof. Let P be a projective generating set consisting of tiny objects. The sets D˚pPq (resp. ˜D˚pPq) are
projective generating sets in Ch˚pEq for ˚ P tď 0,`,´, b,Hu (resp. ˚ P tě 0u). For each n P Z DnpPq is
tiny, as is SnpPq, by Proposition 3.16.
(cid:3)
3.3. Generators in Monoidal Exact Categories. Let us brieﬂy mention a useful compatibility condition
between generators and monoidal structure.

Deﬁnition 3.18. A monoidal exact category which has a set of ﬂat admissible generators is said to be ﬂatly
generated.

Deﬁnition 3.19. A projectively monoidal exact category which is also (quasi)-elementary is said to be
monoidal (quasi)-elementary
Proposition 3.20. Suppose that pE,b, kq is a ﬂatly generated monoidal exact category in which direct sums
are exact. Then every projective object is ﬂat.

Proof. In this case every projective will be a summand of a ﬂat object, and therefore ﬂat.

(cid:3)

In particular to check that a category is projectively monoidal, it suﬃces to ﬁnd a set of ﬂat generators.

3.4. Generators and Adjunctions. We conclude this section with a note about passing generating sets
through adjunctions. The speciﬁc application we have in mind is to categories of algebras over compatible
monads. We have the following general setup F : E Ñ D and | ´ | : D Ñ E are additive functors between
exact categories. Moreover these functors form an adjoint pair

F % | ´ |

Proposition 3.21. Let F % | ´ | be an adjunction as above. Suppose that | ´ | is an exact functor. If P is
a projective object of E then FpPq is a projective object of D.
Proof. Let

0 Ñ X Ñ Y Ñ Z Ñ 0

be a short exact sequence in D, and let P be projective in E. Then we have a diagram

/ HompFpPq, Xq

HompFpPq, Y q

HompFpPq, Zq

/ HompP,|X|q

/ HompP,|Y |q

/ HompP,|Z|q

The vertical arrows are isomorphisms and the bottom row is exact since | ´ | is exact and P is projective.
(cid:3)
Hence the top row is short exact well.

We know how adjunctions act on projectives. Let us now see what happens on generating sets.

Proposition 3.22. Let F % | ´ | be an adjunction as above. Suppose that | ´ | reﬂects admissible epimor-
phisms, and that E has an admissible generating set G. Let FpGq denote the collection tFpGq : G P Gu of
objects of D. Then FpGq is an admissible generating set in D.

Proof. Let X be an object of D. Suppose there is some object Q of E and an admissible epimorphism
p : Q Ñ |X|. There is an induced morphism ˜p : FpQq Ñ X. Then p coincides with the composition
Q Ñ |FpQq| Ñ |X|. By Proposition 2.9, the map |˜p| is an admissible epimorphism. Since | ´ | reﬂects
admissible epimorphisms, ˜p is an admissible epimorphism in D.
Now let G be an admissible generating set in E, and let X be an object of D. Since G is an admissible
G and an admissible epimorphism G (cid:16) |X|. The induced morphism

(2) Suppose that | ´ | is exact, reﬂects epimorphisms and preserves direct sums (resp. ﬁltered colimits).

(2) Since |´| preserves direct sums (resp. ﬁltered colimits) it is clear that F preserves small (resp. tiny)
(cid:3)
Example 3.24. Let T be a compatible monad on an exact category E. Then the forgetful functor | ´ | :
E T Ñ E has a right adjoint F : E Ñ E T assigning to an object the free T -algebra on it. By construction of
the exact structure on E T in Proposition 2.73, the functor | ´ | is admissibly exact and reﬂects exactness.
Moreover it creates limits and colimits. By Lemma 2.74, Proposition 3.23 is applicable in such categories.
3.5. Examples: IndpBanCq and CBornC. Let BanC denote the category of Banach spaces over C, i.e.
the category whose objects are complete normed C-vector spaces and whose morphisms are bounded maps.
We also implicitly assume that we have ﬁxed a universe U, and that the underlying set of a Banach space is
contained in U. By [Pro00], this is a quasi-abelian category. Moreover it has enough projectives. In fact the
projectives are precisely the spaces l1pIq of summable sequences indexed by some set I ([Pro95]).
BanC also has a monoidal structure. If E and F are Banach spaces, the projective tensor product of
E and F , dneoted E ˆbπF is the completion of the usual tensor product Eb F with respect to the cross-norm

It is a closed monoidal structure. The vector space HomCpE, Fq of bounded maps between E and F can be
given the structure of a Banach space. The norm of T : E Ñ F is

||T|| “ supePEzt0u

This gives an internal Hom functor, which we denote by Hom. For details see [BBK13]. Thus pBanC, ˆbπ, Homq
is a monoidal quasi-abelian category. Finally, the projective objects l1pIq are ﬂat by [BBB15]. By Proposi-
tion 3.20 this category is projectively monoidal. Recall that if C is a U-small category for some universe U,
and V a universe, then the V-ind-completion of C is a category constructed as follows. Objects are diagrams
E : I Ñ C where I is a V-small ﬁltrant category. If E : I Ñ C and F : J Ñ C are objects in IndpCq then
we write

HomIndpCqpE, Fq “ limÐI limÑJ HomCpEi, Fjq

Proposition 3.25. Let E be a quasi-abelian category with enough projectives. Then IndpEq is a cocomplete
elementary quasi-abelian category. Moreover, if E is a closed monoidal exact category, then its ind-completion

has a canonical exact closed monoidal structure extending the one on E. Finally if E projectively monoidal
IndpEq.

Proof. See [Sch99] Proposition 2.1.16 and Proposition 2.1.19.

Corollary 3.26. The category IndpBanq is a locally presentable closed, monoidal elementary quasi-abelian
category.

Two more examples of closed, monoidal elementary quasi-abelian category are BornC CBornC, the
categories of bornological spaces of convex type, and complete bornological spaces of convex type respectively.
See [BBB15].

4. Model Structures on Exact Categories

In [Hov02], Hovey introduced the notion of a compatible model structure on an abelian category.
He showed that there is a 1-1 correspondence between such model structures and purely homological data
now known as Hovey triples. Gillespie noticed that this correspondence generalises to weakly idempotent
complete exact categories, and explains in [Gil11] how to adapt Hovey’s proofs. In the next two subsections
we will recall some of Hovey’s/ Gillespie’s results both for the reader’s convenience and because we will
need many of the individual propositions later anyway. We shall modify the exposition somewhat, by ﬁrst
extracting from Hovey’s proof a bijection between cotorsion pairs and compatible weak factorisation systems
(this has been noticed in [ˇSt’12] ). For basic facts about weak factorisation systems and model structures in
general see Appendix B.

4.1. Cotorsion Pairs and Weak Factorization Systems. Let S be a class of objects in an exact category
E. We shall denote by KS the class of all objects X such that Ext1pX, Sq “ 0 for all S P S, and by SK the
class of all objects X such that Ext1pS, Xq “ 0 for all S P S. The class SK is called the class of S-injectives,
and the class KS is called the class of S-projectives. The following technical result will be useful. The
proof is a straightforward generalisation of Lemma 6.2 in [Hov02].
Lemma 4.1. Let E be an exact category. Let S be a class of objects in E, and let L “ KS. Then L is closed
under retracts and ﬁnite extensions. If E is cocomplete it is closed under transﬁnite extensions.

Proof. First we show that L is closed under retracts. Note that it is suﬃcient to show that for a given
Y P E, the collection of objects X such that Ext1pX, Y q “ 0 is closed under retracts. Let X be such that
Ext1pX, Y q “ 0 and let X1 be a retract of X. Then X1 is a summand of X, and so Ext1pX1, Y q “ 0.

Let us show that L is closed under transﬁnite extensions. Again it is suﬃcient to show that for any object
Y P E the collection of all X with Ext1pX, Y q “ 0 is closed under transﬁnite extensions and retracts. More
generally, suppose φ is an ordinal such that for any φ1 ď φ, E has φ1-colimits. Suppose λ is an ordinal
with λ ď φ and X : λ Ñ E is a colimit-preserving functor such that Ext1pX0, Y q “ 0, Xα Ñ Xα`1 is an
admissible monic for all α ă λ and Ext1pCokerpXα Ñ Xα`1q, Y q “ 0 for all α ă λ. We shall prove by
transﬁnite induction that Ext1pXβ, Y q “ 0 for all β ď λ, where Xλ “ colimαăλXα. If λ “ 0 then this is
clear. Suppose that λ is a successor ordinal, so that λ “ α` 1 for some ordinal α. We have Ext1pXα, Y q “ 0
and Ext1pCokerpXα Ñ Xλq, Y q “ 0. The long exact Ext sequence then shows that Ext1pXλ, Y q “ 0.
Now suppose that β ď λ is a limit ordinal, and that Ext1pXα, Y q “ 0 for all α ă β. Let

represent an element of Ext1pXβ, Y q. For each α ď β, pull this short exact sequence back through the map
jα : Xα Ñ Xβ for α ď β. For α ď γ ă β we get a commutative diagram.

Since f is an admissible monic, fα is as well by Proposition 2.9. Since Ext1pXα, Y q “ 0 there is some splitting
tα : Xα Ñ Nα of pα. We are going to modify the tα to sα so that they are compatible, i.e. kα,γsα “ sγjα,γ
for all α ď γ. We will do this by transﬁnite induction.
Set s0 “ t0.
If γ is a limit ordinal let sγ : colimαăγXα Ñ Nγ be the map whose restriction to Xα is
kα,γsα, where kα,γ : Nα Ñ Nγ is the transﬁnite composition of the continuous functor γ Ñ E, β ÞÑ Nβ.
Then by construction kα,γsα “ sγjα,γ.

Now for the successor case. Suppose we have constructed sα. Let us construct sα`1. We have

pα`1pkα,α`1sα ´ tα`1jα,α`1q “ jα,α`1 ˝ pα ˝ sα ´ pα`1 ˝ tα`1 ˝ jα,α`1

“ jα,α`1 ´ jα,α`1
“ 0

Therefore there is a map h : Xα Ñ Y such that fα`1h “ kα,α`1sα ´ tα`1jα,α`1. Since jα,α`1 : Xα Ñ Xα`1
is an admissible monic and Ext1pCokerpjα,α`1q, Y q “ 0, the long exact Ext sequence implies that there is a
map g : Xα`1 Ñ Y such that gjα,α`1 “ h. Let sα`1 “ tα`1 ` fα`1g. Then clearly sα`1 is a section of pα`1.
Moreover

sα`1jα,α`1 “ tα`1 ˝ jα,α`1 ` fα`1g ˝ jα,α`1
“ kα,α`1sα ´ fα`1 ˝ h ` fα`1 ˝ h
“ kα,α`1sα

as required.

(cid:3)

Let us now deﬁne cotorsion pairs, and discuss their relation with weak factorisation systems. We shall

largely follow the notation of [ˇSt’12].
Deﬁnition 4.2. Let E be an exact category. A cotorsion pair on E is a pair of families of objects pL, Rq
of E such that L “ KR and R “ LK.
Deﬁnition 4.3. A cotorsion pair pL, Rq is said to have enough (functorial) projectives if for every
X P E there is an admissible epic p : Y Ñ X, (functorial in X), such that Y P L and Kerppq P R. It is
said to have enough (functorial) injectives if, for every X, there is an admissible monic i : X Ñ Z,
(functorial in X), such that Z P R and Cokerpiq P L. A cotorsion pair is said to be (functorially) complete
if it has enough (functorial) projectives and enough (functorial) injectives.
Example 4.4. Our main example is the projective cotorsion pair. Let E be an exact category. Let ProjpEq
denote the collection of projective objects of E. Then pProjpEq, ObpEqq is clearly a cotorsion pair. Suppose
that E has enough (functorial) projectives. Then the cotorsion pair pProjpEq, ObpEqq is trivially (functori-
ally) complete.

Notation 4.5. Let E be an exact category and pL,Rq a weak factorisation system on E. Denote by CokerL
the collection of objects L such L is a cokernel of some map in, L and by KerR the collection of objects R
such that R is the kernel of some map in R.
Given classes of objects A, B in E, we denoteby InﬂpAq the class of admissible monics with cokernel in A
and by DeﬂpBq the class of admissible epics with kernel in B.
Deﬁnition 4.6. Let E be an exact category. A weak factorisation system pL,Rq on E is said to be com-
patible if

(1) f P L if and only if f is an admissible monic and 0 Ñ Cokerpfq belongs to L.
(2) f P R if and only if f is an admissible epic and Kerpfq Ñ 0 belongs to R.
The following result is Theorem 5.13 in [ˇSt’12].

Theorem 4.7. Let E be an exact category. Then

pL,Rq ÞÑ pCokerL, KerR q and pA, Bq ÞÑ pInﬂpAq, DeﬂpBqq

deﬁne mutually inverse bijective mappings between compatible weak factorisation systems and complete co-
torsion pairs. The bijections restrict to mutually inverse mappings between compatible functorial weak fac-
torisation systems and functorially complete cotorsion pairs.

4.2. Compatible Model Structures. Having described the bijection between cotorsion pairs and compat-
ible weak factorisation systems, we now introduce compatible model structures, and explain how they too
correspond to purely homological data. Remember that we do not assume our model categories are complete
or cocomplete.

Let pC,F,Wq be a model structure on an additive category E.

Deﬁnition 4.8. Let E be an exact category. Let pC,F,Wq be a model structure on E. The model structure
is said to be compatible if both pC X W,Fq and pC,F X Wq are compatible weak factorisation systems.

Let us now deﬁne the corresponding homological data. As for abelian categories, we will call a subcategory

D of an exact category E thick if whenever

0 Ñ A Ñ B Ñ C Ñ 0

is a short exact sequence and two of the objects are in D, then so is the third.
Deﬁnition 4.9. A Hovey triple on an exact category E is a triple pC, W, Fq of collections of objects of E
such that the full subcategory on W is closed under retracts and thick, and that both pC, FXWq and pCXW, Fq
are complete cotorsion pairs.

We then have the following theorem (Theorem 6.9 in [ˇSt’12]). It is originally due to [Hov02] in the abelian

case and [Gil11] in the more general exact case.

Theorem 4.10. Let E be a weakly idempotent complete exact category. Then there is a bijection between
Hovey triples and compatible model structures. The correspondence assigns to a Hovey triple pC, W, Fq the
model structure pC,W,Fq such that

(1) C “ InﬂpCq
(2) F “ DeﬂpFq
(3) W consists of morphisms of the form p ˝ i where i P InﬂpWq and p P DeﬂpWq.
Before we move on let us mention a more general notion than compatible model structures. We will need

it when we consider the projective model structure on Chě0pEq.
Deﬁnition 4.11. Let E be an exact category. A model structure pC,F,Wq on E is said to be left pseudo-
compatible if there are classes of objects C and W such that

40

JACK KELLY

(1) The full subcategory on W is thick.
(2) A map f is in C (resp. CXW) if and only if it is an admissible monic with cokernel in C (resp. CXW).
(3) An admissible monic is in W if and only if its cokernel is in W.

As before C/ W /C X W are called the coﬁbrant /trivial/ trivially coﬁbrant objects. The pair pC, Wq
will be called the left homological Waldhausen pair of the model structure. Dually one deﬁnes right
pesudo-compatible model structures and right homological Waldhausen pairs

Remark 4.12. The terminology comes from the notion of a Waldhausen category, in which classes of weak
equivalences and coﬁbrations are speciﬁed.

Clearly any compatible model structure is left pseudo-compatible.

4.3. Small Cotorsion Pairs and Coﬁbrant Generation. When working with model categories, it is
computationally convenient that they be coﬁbrantly small/ cellular (see Appendix B for exactly what we
mean here). In this section, we study what conditions on the cotorsion pairs deﬁning a compatible model
structure guarantee that the model structure is coﬁbrantly small. The material here is adapted from [Hov02]
§6 to exact categories.
Deﬁnition 4.13. Let E be an exact category. A cotorsion pair pL, Rq on E is said to be cogenerated by
a set if there is a set of objects G in L such that X P R if and only if Ext1pG, Xq “ 0 for all G P G.
Deﬁnition 4.14. Suppose E is an exact category. A cotorsion pair pL, Rq is said to be small if the following
conditions hold

(1) L contains a set of admissible generators.
(2) pL, Rq is cogenerated by a set G.
(3) For each G P G there is an admissible monic iG with cokernel G such that, if HomEpiG, Xq is
The set of iG together with the maps 0 Ñ Ui for some generating set tUiu contained in L is called a set of
generating morphisms of pL, Rq.

surjective for all G P G, then X P R.

There is an easy example.

Example 4.15. Recall the projective cotorsion pair pProjpEq, ObpEqq. Suppose that the category E is
projectively generated, with P a generating set of projectives. We claim that in this case the projective
cotorsion pair is small. Indeed by assumption ProjpEq contains a set of generators P. This set trivially
cogenerates the cotorsion pair as well. The third condition is also trivial.

We now come to the connection between coﬁbrantly small model structures and cotorsion pairs. The

proof of the following is a straightforward modiﬁcation of [Hov02] Lemma 6.7.
Lemma 4.16. Let E be an exact category together with a compatible weak factorisation system pL,Rq with
corresponding cotorsion pair pL, Rq. If the cotorsion pair is small, then this weak factorisation system is
coﬁbrantly small. If in addition the generating morphisms have tiny domain, the weak factorisation system
is cellular.
Proof. Let I denote a set of generating morphisms for pL, Rq. Note that every map of I is an admissible
monic with cokernel in L, i.e. it is in L. Suppose p : A Ñ B has the right lifting property with respect to
I. Then HompUi, pq is surjective for every Ui in some generating set tUiu of E, so p is an admissible epic.
Now, we have a pull-back square

By Lemma B.2 Kerppq Ñ 0 also has the right lifting property with respect to I. Hence Hompi, Kerppqq
is surjective for all i P I. Therefore Kerppq P R, so p is in R. The statement about cellularity is now
(cid:3)
obvious.
4.4. Cotorsion Pairs on Monoidal Exact Categories. In this section pE,b, kq is a monoidal exact
category.
resulting structure is monoidal. We generalise the work of [Hov02] §7 to exact categories.

We will now study suﬃcient conditions on cotorsion pairs deﬁning a model category structure so that the

Deﬁnition 4.17. A short exact sequence in a monoidal exact category E is said to be pure if it remains
exact after tensoring with any object of E. An admissible monic is said to be pure if it remains an admissible
monic after tensoring with any object of E.

Theorem 4.18. Let E be a closed symmetric monoidal exact category. Suppose that E has a left pseudo-
compatible model structure with Waldhausen pair pC, Wq. Suppose the following conditions are satisﬁed.

(1) Every coﬁbration is pure.
(2) If X, Y P C then X b Y P C.
(3) If X, Y P C and one of them is in W, then X b Y P C X W.

(4) The unit I of the monoidal structure is in C.

Then E is a monoidal model category.

In order to prove this we need the following result and its corollary.

Proposition 4.19. Let E be a weakly idempotent complete exact category, Suppose we have a diagram

0 Ñ Kerpδq (cid:26) Kerpq ˝ÝÑ Kerpφq ˝ÝÑ Cokerpδq ˝ÝÑ Cokerpq (cid:16) Cokerpφq Ñ 0

Proof. Pass to a left abelianisation and use the Snake Lemma there. (This can actually be proved internally
(cid:3)
without passing to an abelianization, see [B¨uh10]).

phism with cokernel l ˝ k : Q Ñ S.

where the top left square is a push-out. Since coﬁbrations are pure by assumption, the rows of the diagram
are exact. Moreover, both i b idA1 and i b idC1 are admissible monomorphisms, and the cokernel of i b idC1
is C b C1. By Corollary 4.20, i b j is an admissible monomorphism with cokernel C b C1. By assumption
C b C1 P C, so that i b j is a coﬁbration. Again by assumption, if either of C or C1 is in W then so is C b C1,
(cid:3)
and hence in this case i b j is a trivial coﬁbration.

Remark 4.21. The statement of Theorem 4.18 also holds without the assumption that the monoidal structure
is compatible with the exact structure, since it was not used at all in proof. This is also shown in [ˇSt’12].
However the remaining results do require this assumption.

The next lemma says that if coﬁbrant objects are ﬂat then condition 1 in Theorem 4.18 is automatically

satisﬁed.
Lemma 4.22. Suppose E is a symmetric monoidal exact category with enough ﬂat objects. If C P E is ﬂat
then every short exact sequence

0 Ñ A Ñ B Ñ C Ñ 0

is pure.

Proof. Suppose Z is arbitrary and let

0 Ñ X Ñ Y Ñ Z Ñ 0

be a short exact sequence with Y ﬂat. We have a diagram

with admissibly coacyclic rows and columns. The bottom row is short exact since C is ﬂat. Since Y is ﬂat
the middle column is short exact. We need to prove that the right-hand column is short exact. In order
to do this we may pass to a right abelianization of E, and so without loss of generality assume that E is
(cid:3)
abelian. Then the argument becomes a simple diagram chase.

Proposition 4.23. Pure monics are stable under push out.

Theorem 4.24. Let E be a bicomplete, monoidal exact category Suppose that E has a left pseudo-compatible
model structure satisfying the hypotheses of Theorem 4.18. In addition, suppose that the following conditions
hold

(1) If X P C X W and Y is arbitrary, then X b Y is in W.

(2) Transﬁnite compositions of weak equivalences which are also pure monics are still weak equivalences.

Then the model structure satisﬁes the monoid axiom.
Proof. The ﬁrst condition implies that if i is an acyclic coﬁbration, then i b Y is a weak equivalence. By
Propositions 4.23 and Proposition 2.7, any push out of i b Y is a weak equivalence as well as a pure monic.
(cid:3)
By the second condition, any transﬁnite composition of such maps is a weak equivalence.

If in E transﬁnite compositions of admissible monics are admissible monics (e.g. if E is elementary) then
one can replace the second condition by requiring that the class W is closed under transﬁnite compositions
of pure monomorphisms. By this we mean that if λ is some ordinal, and X : λ Ñ E a continuous functor
such that 0 Ñ X0 is a weak equivalence, and for each i ă j in λ the map Xi Ñ Xj is a pure monic which
is also a weak equivalence, then Xλ is in W. (This is the condition used in [Hov02] Theorem 7.4). Since
W forms a thick subcategory and X0 Ñ Xλ is an admissible monic, this is equivalent to the cokernel of the
map X0 Ñ Xλ being in W which in turn is equivalent to X0 Ñ Xλ being a weak equivalence.

4.5. Model Structures on Chain Complexes. Generalising results of [Gil04], in this section we describe
a method for constructing compatible model structures on categories of chain complexes Ch˚pEq from
cotorsion pairs on E. Note that what we describe below will not always produce a model structure. However
we will show in the next chapter that it does in the case that E has enough projectives, and the cotorsion
pair is the projective one (Example 4.4). First we deﬁne the collections of objects which will be candidates
for the (trivially) ﬁbrant and (trivially) coﬁbrant objects.
Deﬁnition 4.25. Let pL, Rq be a cotorsion pair on an exact category E. Let X P ChpEq be a chain complex.
(1) X is called an L complex if it is acyclic and ZnX P L for all n. The collection of all L complexes is

denoted ˜L.

(2) X is called an R complex if it is acyclic and ZnX P R for all n. The collection of all R complexes

is denoted ˜R.

(3) X is called a dgL complex if Xn P L for each n, and HompX, Bq is exact whenever B is an R

complex. The collection of all dgL complexes is denoted ˜dgL.

0,ď 0,`,´, bu. We will use the same notation for these collections irrespective of which category of chain
complexes we are working in.
Remark 4.27. In Ch˚pEq for ˚ P t`,´,ě 0, b,Hu all of the above classes are closed under shifts rns for
n ď 0. For ˚ P t`,´,ď 0, b,Hu they are closed under shifts rns for n ě 0.

Let us start to populate these collections. We ﬁrst make the following easy observation.

Proposition 4.28. Let X be an R-complex. Then Xn P R for each n.
Proof. For each n we have a short exact sequence

and ZnX, Zn´1X P R. By Proposition 4.1 R is closed under extensions.

0 Ñ ZnX Ñ Xn Ñ Zn´1X Ñ 0

(cid:3)

With this in mind we have the following straightforward generalisation of [Gil04] Lemma 3.4.

Lemma 4.29.

(1) Bounded below complexes with entries in L are dgL complexes.

(2) Bounded above complex with entries in R are dgR complexes.

Proof.

(1) Let pX, dXq be a bounded below complex with entries in L. We shall show that any f : X Ñ B
is homotopic to zero, where B is an R-complex. Consider such a map. Without loss of generality
we may assume Xn “ 0 for n ă 0. Since d1 is admissible, we have an exact sequence

1 Ñ B1 Ñ ImdB
Moereover, each object belongs to R. Since X´1 “ 0 , f0 : X0 Ñ B0 factors through ImdB
abuse of notation, we also denote the factor X0 Ñ ImdB
sequence

1 . By
1 by f0. By assumption, we have an exact

0 Ñ KerdB

1 Ñ 0

0 Ñ HomEpX0, KerdB

1 q Ñ HomEpX0, B1q Ñ HomEpX0, ImdB

1 q Ñ 0

Hence f0 lifts to a map D1 : X0 Ñ B1,
g1 “ f1 ´ D1dB
As before we can lift g1 to a map D2 : X1 Ñ B2 such that dB
inductively, we construct a homotopy tDku such that dB

1 D1 “ f0. Set
1 g1 “ 0 by direct calculation, so g1 : X1 Ñ B1 factors through ImdB
2 .
1 . Continuing

2 D2 “ g1 “ f1 ´ D1dB

there exists a D1 such that dB

k´1 “ fk´1 as required.

i.e.

(2) This is dual to the previous part.

(cid:3)

Gillespie’s crucial Proposition 3.6 in [Gil04] does not hold in arbitrary exact categories. However some of

it can be salvaged to give the following result.
Proposition 4.30. Let pL, Rq be a cotorsion pair in an exact category E. Then in Ch˚pEq for ˚ P
t`,´, b,Hu we have
(1) dg ˜L “ K ˜R.
(2) dg ˜R “ ˜LK
(3) ˜R Ď pdg ˜LqK
(4) ˜L Ď Kpdg ˜Rq

45

(5) Suppose E has enough L-objects. Let X P pdg ˜LqK be good. Then X is an R-complex.
(6) Suppose E has enough R-objects. Let X P Kdgp ˜Rq be cogood. Then X is an L-complex.
(1) Let X P K ˜R. Then Ext1pX, Bq “ 0 whenever B is an R complex. In particular Ext1

dwpX, Bq “
0. Hence HompX, Bq is exact whenever B is an R complex by Corollary 2.65. It remains to show
Xn P L. Let B P R. By Lemma 3.10 we have

Proof.

Ext1pXn, Bq “ Ext1pX, Dn`1Bq “ 0

since Dn`1B P ˜R. So Xn P L, and K ˜R Ă dg ˜L. Now let X P dg ˜L. Since the entries of X are in L,
for any Y P ˜R, any short exact sequence

0

/ Y

/ Z

/ X

/ 0

is split exact in each degree. But also Ext1
exact, i.e. Ext1pX, Y q “ 0.

dwpX, Y q “ 0. Hence, any sequence as above must be split

(2) This is dual to the previous part.
(3) Let X P ˜R and A P dg ˜L. Note that since Xn P R, Ext1pX, Aq “ Ext1

is exact, Ext1

dwpX, Aq “ 0.

dwpX, Aq. Now since HompA, Xq

(4) This is dual to the previous part.

(5) Let us show that X is acyclic. We will again use Proposition 2.29 Let n be such that dn has a
n : A1 Ñ ZnX for
kernel. Since we have enough L-objects, we may choose an admissible epic f1
dwpSnpA1qr´1s, Xq Ă
some A1 P L. By Lemma 3.10 this induces a map f : SnpA1q Ñ X. Now Ext1
Ext1pSnpA1qr´1s, Xq “ 0 by assumption. Hence f is homotopic to 0. Applying Proposition 2.33
n`1 : Xn`1 Ñ ZnX is an admissible epic. By Proposition 2.29 X is acyclic. To see that
the map d1
ZnX P R, we note that since X is acyclic, we have for any A P L,
EpA, ZnXq – Ext1pSnA, Xq “ 0

Ext1

Since pL, Rq is a cotorsion pair, ZnX P R. Hence X P ˜R and so pdg ˜LqK Ď ˜R.

(6) The proof for the second part is dual.

(cid:3)

We also have the following

Proposition 4.31. Let ˚ P tě 0u, and let pL, Rq be a cotorsion pair in E with enough L-objects. Then
dg ˜L “ K ˜R and ˜R “ pdg ˜LqK.

Dually, if the cotorsion pair has enough R-objects, then for ˚ P tď 0u dg ˜R “ ˜LK and ˜L “ Kdgp ˜Rq.

Proof. The proofs of parts (3) and (5) in the previous proposition go through here, as does the proof that
dg ˜L Ă K ˜R. Now let X P K ˜R. The same proof as in part (1) of the previous proposition shows that each Xn
must be an object in L. Thus X is a bounded below complex of objects in L and hence a dg ˜L complex. (cid:3)

We get as an immediate corollary:

Corollary 4.32. Let pL, Rq be a cotorsion pair on an exact category E with enough L-objects and enough
R-objects.
(1) pdg ˜L, ˜Rq is a cotorsion pair on Chě0pEq and Ch`pEq. If E has all kernels then it is a cotorsion

pair on ChpEq.

(2) p˜L, dg ˜Rq is a cotorsion pair on Chď0pEq and Ch´pEq. If E has all cokernels then it is a cotorsion

pair in ChpEq.

(3) p˜L, dg ˜Rq and pdg ˜L, ˜Rq are cotorsion pairs in ChbpEq.
(4) If E has all kernels and cokernels, in particular if E is quasi-abelian, then p˜L, dg ˜Rq and pdg ˜L, ˜Rq are

cotorsion pairs in ChpEq.

4.5.1. Existence of dg-Model Structures. The hope now is that the class W of acyclic complexes satisﬁes

˜L “ dg ˜L X W, ˜R “ dg ˜R X W

and that the cotorsion pairs pdg ˜L, ˜Rq and p˜L, dg ˜Rq are functorially complete. It is not at all clear that this
will be the case. In [YD14] it is shown that for a bicomplete abelian category in which inﬁnite products are
exact (i.e. an AB4˚ abelian category) it is always the case. We suspect this result can be easily adapted for
bicomplete exact categories satisfying a similar condition. In general we do not know how to give useable
conditions on a cotorsion pair pL, Rq which guarantee that pdg ˜L, ˜Rq and p˜L, dg ˜Rq induce a model structure.
However we will obtain some partial results in this direction. First we need acyclic complexes to form a thick
subcategory.
Proposition 4.33. Let E be an exact category. Then for ˚ P tě 0,ď 0,`,´, bu the full subcategory on W
is a thick subcategory of Ch˚pEq. If E has all kernels then this is also true for ˚ “ tHu.
Proof. One may assume that E is abelian by passing to a left abelianization for ˚ P tě 0,`, bu, (or a right
abelianization for ˚ P tď 0,´u). The result in this case follows from the long exact sequence on homology. (cid:3)
It turns out that we always have the inclusions ˜L Ă dg ˜L X W, and ˜R Ă dg ˜R X W. This follows from the

next result, which is an easy modiﬁcation of the proof of [Gil04] Lemma 3.9.

Lemma 4.34. Every chain map from an L complex to an R complex is homotopic to 0.
Proof. Let X be an L-complex and Y an R-complex. Let f : X Ñ Y be a chain map. Let us ﬁrst show that
f may be a replaced with a homotopic map g which satisﬁes dngn “ 0, and gndn`1 “ 0. We then show that
such a map must necessarily be homotopic to 0.
The map fn : Xn Ñ Yn restricts to ˆfn : ZnX Ñ ZnY . Moreover, since Y is acyclic we have an exact
sequence

and the objects in the sequence are in R. Since ZnX P L, we get an exact sequence

0 Ñ Zn`1Y Ñ Yn`1 Ñ ZnY Ñ 0

0 Ñ HompZnX, Zn`1Y q Ñ HompZnX, Yn`1q Ñ HompZnX, ZnY q Ñ 0

Hence there exists an αn : ZnX Ñ Yn`1 such that dn`1αn “ ˆfn. We also know that

0 Ñ ZnX Ñ Xn Ñ Zn´1X Ñ 0

is an exact sequence of objects in L. So

0 Ñ HompZn´1X, Yn`1q Ñ HompXn, Yn`1q Ñ HompZnX, Yn`1q Ñ 0

is exact. Hence there exists βn : Xn Ñ Yn`1 which is αn when restricted to ZnX. Now put gn “
fn´pdn`1βn` βn´1dnq. By direct calculation, g “ tgnu is a chain map such that dngn “ 0 and gndn`1 “ 0..
By construction it is homotopic to f .
Now we show that a map g satisfying dngn “ 0, gndn`1 “ 0 must be homotopic to 0. For convenience

L
ZnX “ CokerpZnX Ñ Xnq. Now gn induces a map gn : Xn

Thus there exists a map δn : Zn´1X Ñ Yn`1 such that dn`1δn “ ˆgn. We claim that the maps δndn : Xn Ñ

Corollary 4.35. Let pL, Rq be a cotorsion pair in an exact category. Then ˜L Ă dg ˜LXW, and ˜R Ă dg ˜RXW.
In order to have any chance of getting the reverse inclusion, we’ll need the cotorsion pair on E to be
hereditary. The following deﬁnition and the subsequent proposition are immediate generalisations of [Roz99]
§1.2.3 from abelian categories to exact categories.
Deﬁnition 4.36. A cotorsion pair pL, Rq is said to be hereditary if

ExtipA, Bq “ 0

for any A P L, B P R and i ě 1.
Example 4.37. Clearly the projective cotorsion pair is hereditary.
Proposition 4.38. Let pL, Rq be a hereditary cotorsion pair on an exact category E. Then

(1) L is resolving. That is L is closed under taking kernels of admissible epis.

(2) R is coresolving. That is R is closed under taking cokernels of admissible monics.

If E has enough R-projectives then pL, Rq is hereditary if and only if L is resolving. Dually if E has enough
L-injectives then pL, Rq is hereditary if and only if R is coresolving.
Proof. Let
be an exact sequence with A, A1 P L. Let B P R. Then we have the long exact sequence
. . . Ñ ExtipA1, Bq Ñ ExtipA, Bq Ñ ExtipK, Bq Ñ Exti`1pA1, Bq Ñ . . .

0 Ñ K Ñ A Ñ A1 Ñ 0

Now for i ě 1 the ﬁrst, second and last terms vanish since A, A1 P L. Hence ExtipK, Bq “ 0 for all B P R
and all i ě 1. In particular K P L.

The second statement is dual
Now assume that E has enough R-projectives. Note that all projectives are contained in L. Let A P L.
Since E has enough projectives we may construct an exact sequence

with P R-projective. Since P P L, K P L as well. Let B P R.

Since P is R-projective, we get an isomorphism

ExtipK, Bq ˜ÑExti`1pA, Bq

and the claim follows by induction.

The last statement is again dual.

(cid:3)

With this result in hand we can easily generalise [Gil04] Theorem 3.12 to the exact setting.

Theorem 4.39. Let pL, Rq be a hereditary cotorsion pair in an exact category E. If E has enough projectives
then in Ch˚pEq for ˚ P tě 0,`,Hu, dg ˜R X W “ ˜R.
If E has enough injectives then in Ch˚pEq for
˚ P tď 0,´,Hu dg ˜L X W “ ˜L. In particular, if E has enough projectives and injectives, then the induced
cotorsion pairs on E are compatible.

Proof. We shall show the ﬁrst statement, the second being dual.
Let X be an acyclic dgR complex. We need to show that Ext1pA, ZnXq “ 0 for all A P L. Let P˝ be
an augmented projective resolution of A

P˝ “ . . . Ñ P2 Ñ P1 Ñ A Ñ 0

with Pi projective. Since projectives are in L, and the cotorsion pair is hereditary, P˝ is an L-complex.

0 Ñ ZnX Ñ Xn Ñ Zn´1X Ñ 0

with A P ˜L and B P dg ˜R. Since X and A are each acyclic, so is B by Proposition 4.33. But then B is an
R-complex by hypothesis. Hence the sequence splits by Proposition 4.30 and X is a direct summand of A.
(cid:3)
In particular it is an L-complex.

These next two results partially deal with the issue of completeness.

Lemma 4.41. Let E be an exact category. Suppose

or cogood. Then B is acyclic if and only if f is a quasi-isomorphism.

is an exact sequence and Ext1pA, Xnq “ 0 since Xn P R. So by the long exact sequence, it is suﬃcient to
show that
is surjective. Let f : A Ñ Zn´1X be a morphism. By Lemma 2.51 f induces a chain map P˝rn ´ 1s Ñ X.
Since X is a dgR complex and P˝rn ´ 1s is an L-complex this map is homotopic to 0. Any chain homotopy
tDnufrom f to 0 will give a lift f “ dnDn´1.
(cid:3)

HompA, Xnq Ñ HompA, Zn´1Xq

Lemma 3.14 in [Gil04], which partially handles the case in which we may not have enough injectives or

projectives also passes essentially unaﬀected to exact categories.
Lemma 4.40. Let E be an exact category and pL, Rq a cotorsion pair on E. Consider the categories Ch˚pEq
for any ˚ P tě 0,ď 0,`,´, b,Hu.

(1) If p˜L, dg ˜Rq is a cotorsion pair with enough projectives and dg ˜R X W “ ˜R then dg ˜L X W “ ˜L.
(2) If pdg ˜L, ˜Rq is a cotorsion pair with enough injectives and dg ˜L X W “ ˜L then dg ˜R X W “ ˜R.

Proof. The statements are dual so we focus on the ﬁrst.
Let X be an exact dgL complex. Sincep˜L, dg ˜Rq has enough projectives we have a short exact sequence

If f‚ is a quasi-isomorphism, then conepIpf‚qq is acyclic. It is also an admissible epimorphism, so CokerpIpf‚qq “

If B is acyclic then again since CokerpIpf‚qq “ 0, HnpconepIpf‚qqq “ 0 as well. Thus Ipfq is a quasi-
(cid:3)
Proposition 4.42. Let pL, Rq be a functorially complete cotorsion pair on an exact category E. Then the
cotorsion pair pdg ˜L, ˜Rq on both Chě0pEq and Ch`pEq has enough functorial projectives.
Proof. Let X‚ be an object of Ch˚pEq where ˚ P tě 0,`u. By an easy adaptation of the proof of Lemma
2.50, one can ﬁnd a (functorial) quasi-isomorphism f‚ : L‚ Ñ X‚ with each Ln an object of L, which is
an admissible epimorphism, and whose kernel is a complex R‚ with Rn P R. Now L‚ is a dgL complex by
Lemma 4.29. By Lemma 4.41 R‚ is acyclic, and therefore an R-complex. So the cotorsion pair has enough
(cid:3)
(functorial) projectives.

This is essentially all that can be said at this level of generality.

4.5.2. Properties of dg-Model Structures.
Deﬁnition 4.43. Let E be an exact category and pL, Rq a cotorsion pair on E. If p˜L, dg ˜Rq and pdg ˜L, ˜Rq
are (functorially) complete cotorsion pairs on Ch˚pEq for ˚ P tě 0,ď 0, b,`,´Hu satisfying dgL X W “ ˜L
and dgR X W “ ˜R, then we say pL, Rq is dg˚ ´ compatible.

In particular, if pL, Rq is dg˚-compatible, then there is an induced compatible model structure on Ch˚pEq.

The resulting model structure will have quasi-isomorphisms as its weak equivalences.
Proposition 4.44. Suppose that ˚ P tě 0,ď 0,`,´, bu cotorsion pair on an exact category E. The weak
equivalences in the induced model structure are precisely the quasi-isomorphisms. If E has all kernels then
this is also true for ˚ P tHu.
Proof. First we show that admissible monics and admissible epics which are weak equivalences are quasi-
ismorphisms. We will show it for monics, the case of epics being dual. Let f : A Ñ B be an an admissible
monic which is a weak equivalence. It is suﬃcient to show that Ipfq is quasi-isomorphism, where I : E Ñ ApEq
is a suitable abelianization. Now we have an exact sequence

/ A

f

/ B

g

/ C

/ 0

0

with C P W. In particular, C is acyclic. By (the dual of) Lemma 4.41, f is a quasi-isomorphism.

Let f be a morphism of Ch˚pEq. Factor it as p ˝ i where i is a ﬁbration, p is a coﬁbration and either p

or i is trivial, and therefore a quasi-isomorphism. By the exact triangle
conepiq Ñ conepfq Ñ coneppq Ñ`1

and the fact that acyclic complexes form a thick subcategory, we ﬁnd that f is a quasi-isomorphism if and
(cid:3)
only the other factor is trivial.

Remark 4.45. The previous result says that the homotopy category of a model structure arising from a
dg-compatible cotorsion pair is the derived category (for ˚ P t`,´, b,Hu).

Such model structures are also both left and right proper. More generally, we have the following.

Proposition 4.46. Let E be an exact category. Let ˚ P tě 0,ď 0,`,´, bu. Suppose there is a model
structure on Ch˚pEq whose weak equivalences are the quasi-isomorphisms and such that any coﬁbration is
an admissible monomorphism in each degree. Then the model structure is left proper. If E has all kernels
then this is also true for ChpEq. Dually, if any ﬁbration is an admissible epimorphism in each degree then
the model structure is right proper.

4.5.3. Small dg-Cotorsion Pairs. Let us now examine when the cotorsion pair p˜L, dg ˜Rq is small. The fol-
lowing result is adapted from [Gil07] Proposition 3.8.
Proposition 4.47. Let pL, Rq be a cotorsion pair in an exact category E which has a set of admissible
generators G. Suppose that pL, Rq is cogenerated by a set tAiuiPI . Then pdg ˜L, ˜Rq is cogenerated by the set

n`1p˜yq. Now, p is an epic, so there is ˜x P Xn`1 such that ˜y “ pp˜xq. Write a “ px` dX

Furthermore, suppose pL, Rq is small with generating morphisms the map t0 Ñ G : G P Gu together with

Then pdg ˜L, ˜Rq is small with generating morphisms the set

for ˚ P t`u (and. ˚ P tHu if E has kernels) and

for ˚ P tě 0u.
Proof. We prove the result for ˚ P t`,Hu and then explain how to modify it for ˚ P tě 0u.

By Proposition 4.29, S Ď dg ˜L. Hence ˜R Ă SK.

Conversely suppose X P SK. We ﬁrst show that X is acyclic. Consider the short exact sequences

0 Ñ Sn´1pGq Ñ DnpGq Ñ SnpGq Ñ 0

We get an exact sequence of abelian groups

HompDnpGq, Xq Ñ HompSn´1pGq, Xq Ñ Ext1pSnpGq, Xq

by assumption. Hence HompDnpGq, Xq Ñ HompSn´1pGq, Xq is surjective for each G and X is acyclic. Now
for all i P I we have by Lemma 3.10

ChpEqpSnpAiq, Xq – Ext1
Since tAiu cogenerates the cotorsion pair pL, Rq we get ZnX P R.
Finally we prove smallness. By Proposition 3.15, the set tDnpGq : G P Gu generates Ch˚pEq. By Proposition
4.29, DnpGq P dg ˜L. In particular dg ˜L contains these generators. Let X be any chain complex. If for each G
the map
is a surjection, then X is acyclic. It remains to show that ZnX P R. By Lemma 3.10, a map Yi Ñ ZnX
induces a morphism SnpYiq Ñ X. By assumption this extends over Snpkiq to a map SnpZiq Ñ X. Again
by Lemma 3.10 this implies that any map Yi Ñ ZnX extends over ki to a map Zi Ñ ZnX. By assumption
this means ZnX P R.
Now consider the case ˚ P tě 0u. The only diﬀerence in the proof is that now the generating set for
Chě0pEq is tDnpGq : G P G : n ą 0u Y tS0pGq : G P Gu. This is also a subset of dg ˜L.
(cid:3)
Remark 4.48. In the situation of the previous proposition, if the domains of the generating morphisms for
the cotorsion pair pL, Rq are tiny, then the domains of the maps in I are also tiny by Proposition 3.16.

5. The Projective Model Structure and the Dold-Kan Correspondence

5.1. The Projective Model Structure. In this section E is an exact category with enough functorial
projectives. We denote the collection of all projective objects in E by ProjpEq
Deﬁnition 5.1. Let E be an exact category. If it exists, the projective model structure on Ch˚pEq, for
˚ P t`,Hu is the model structure in which

‚ Weak equivalences are quasi-isomorphisms.
‚ Fibrations are degree-wise admissible epics.
‚ Coﬁbrations are maps which have the left-lifting property with respect to acyclic ﬁbrations.
˜ProjpEq,

Proposition 5.2. Let E be an exact category. Suppose that the cotorsion pair pdg
Ch˚pEq for ˚ P t`,ě 0,Hu has enough functorial projectives. Then it has enough functorial injectives.
Proof. Let X‚ be an object of Ch˚pEq, and let f‚ : L‚ Ñ X‚ be a quasi-isomorphism and admissible
epimorphism with acyclic kernel, and L‚ P dg

˜ObpEqq on

˜ProjpEq.

We have a short exact sequence

conepf‚q is an acyclic complex, so it is in

0 Ñ X‚ Ñ conepf‚q Ñ L‚r´1s Ñ 0
˜ObpEq. Clearly L‚r´1s P dg

˜ProjpEq.

(cid:3)

We are now ready to prove the following theorem.

Theorem 5.3. Let E be an exact category with enough projectives. Then the projective model structure
exists on Ch`pEq and is compatible. It is functorial if E has enough functorial projectives. It is cellular if
E is elementary, and combinatorial if E is locally presentable. If E has all kernels and the functor limÑN
exists and is exact then this is all true for ChpEq as well.
˜ProjpEq,

Remark 5.4. The existence of the projective model structure on bounded below chain complexes on a quasi-
abelian category with enough projectives was already known to B¨uhler [B¨uh11] (see Appendix C). The proof
there is more direct. In fact the proof works for any idempotent complete exact category in which the class
of all kernel-cokernel pairs forms the exact structure (all kernels and cokernels need not exist).

Recall that if E is (quasi)-elementary quasi-abelian, then Proposition 3.7 says that LH pEq is as well. Thus
the projective model structure exists on ChpLH pEqq. Moreover the induced functor I : ChpEq Ñ ChpLH pEqq
is then right Quillen. Indeed it is left adjoint to the induced functor C : ChLH pEq Ñ ChpEq. It preserves
ﬁbrations since I : E Ñ LH pEq is a left abelianization, and it preserves quasi-isomorphisms by Corollary
2.84. Moreover by Theorem 2.82, Proposition 2.83 and Proposition 4.44 it induces an equivalence between
the homotopy categories. We therefore have

Proposition 5.5. Let E be an elementary quasi-abelian category. Then the adjunction

ChpLH pEqq

ChpEq

C

I

is a Quillen equivalence between the projective model structures.

We claim that the projective model structure exists also on Chě0pEq for E an exact category with kernels.
It will be left pseudo-compatible, but not compatible.
Deﬁnition 5.6. Let E be an exact category. If it exists, the projective model structure on Chě0pEq, is
the model structure in which

‚ Weak equivalences are quasi-isomorphisms.
‚ Fibrations are degree-wise admissible epics in each strictly positive degree.
‚ Coﬁbrations are maps which have the left-lifting property with respect to acyclic ﬁbrations.

Theorem 5.7. Let E be an exact category with enough projectives and which has all kernels. Then the
projective model structure exists on Chě0pEq. Moreover it is a left pseudo-compatible model structure with
˜dgProjpEq, Wq. In particular the acyclic coﬁbrations are the degree-wise admissible monics
Waldhausen pair p
whose cokernels are split exact complexes of projectives. If E is elementary then it is cellular. In particular
if E is locally presentable and elementary then the projective model structure is combinatorial.
Proof. The class of weak equivalences satisﬁes the 2-out-of-6 property since it does so in Ch`pEq. Denote the
class of ﬁbrations by F and of weak equivalences by W. Also denote the class of admissible monomorphisms
with degree-wise projective cokernel by C. Let us show that F XW consists of quasi-isomorphisms which are
admissible epimorphisms in each degree. In order to do this, one may ﬁrst pass to a left abelianization and
assume that E is abelian. Here the argument is a simple diagram chase. By Proposition 4.42 and Proposition

5.2, it follows pC,F X Wq is a (compatible) weak factorisation system with corresponding cotorsion pair
dgProjpEq, Wq. In particular the coﬁbrations in the sense of Deﬁnition 5.6 coincide with the class C. It
p
therefore remains to check that pC X W,Fq is a weak factorisation system.
Let us ﬁrst check the lifting conditions. First suppose a map A‚ Ñ B‚ in Chě0pEq has the left lifting
property with respect to maps X‚ Ñ Y‚ in Chě0pEq which are admissible epimorphisms in each strictly
positive degree. Let E‚ Ñ F‚ be a map between any complexes in ChpEq which is an admissible epimorphism
in all degrees. Consider a diagram

53

A‚

B‚

/ E‚

/ F‚

Since A‚ and B‚ are in Chě0 we can factor the above diagram as
/ E‚

/ τě0E‚

A‚

B‚

/ τě0F‚

/ F‚

Now the map τě0E‚ Ñ τě0F‚ is an epimorphism in each strictly positive degree. By assumption we can ﬁnd
a lift as follows.

´
Thus the map A‚ Ñ B‚ has the left-lifting property with respect to all degree-wise epimorphisms in Ch`pEq.
By Theorem 5.3 A‚ Ñ B‚ is an admissible monic whose cokernel is a split exact complex of projectives.
Now, any acyclic coﬁbration is of the form A‚ Ñ A‚‘
where each Pn is a projective object
in E, and the map is the inclusion into the ﬁrst factor of the direct sum. Clearly then it is enough to show
that the collection of maps t0 Ñ DnpPq : n ą 0, P is projective u has the left lifting property with respect
to F, and that a map is in F if and only if it has the right-lifting property with respect to these maps.
However this follows from Lemma 3.10 and Proposition 3.2.
It remains to ﬁnd a (functorial) factorisation. Let f‚ : X‚ Ñ Y‚ be a map in Chě0pEq. We can factor it
in Ch`pEq as

¯
‘ną0 DnpPnq

¯
‘ně0 DnpPnq
¯
¯
‘ną0 DnpPnq

X‚ Ñ X‚‘
where X‚ Ñ X‚‘

´
an admissible epimorphism in each degree. Then
´
X‚ Ñ X‚‘
¯
is also a factorisation of f‚, X‚ Ñ X‚‘
DnpPnq
We prove the statement about cellularity. Suppose that P is a projective generating set consisting of tiny
objects. It follows from Proposition 4.47 that the weak factorsiation system pC,F X Wq is cellular. From
our proof above that pC X W,Fq is a weak factorisation system, it follows that t0 Ñ DnpPq : n ą 0, P P Pu
is a set of generating morphisms for pC X W,Fq, so it is also a cellular weak factorisation system. The claim

about combinatoriality is clear.

Remark 5.8. The existence of the projective model structure on Chě0pEq in the case that E is quasi-abelian
was also known. This is mentioned in a math.stackexchange.com exchange, [uh], as an adaptation of the
proof for Ch`pEq in [B¨uh11].
5.2. The Projective Model Structure on Monoidal Exact Categories. We now turn our attention
to monoidal model structures on categories of chain complexes.
Proposition 5.9. Let pE,b, kq be an additive symmetric monoidal category with E an exact category. For
˚ P tě 0,ď 0, b,`,´u the ﬂat objects in pCh˚pEq,b, S0pkqq are precisely the complexes F‚ in Ch˚pEq such
that for each n P N, Fn is ﬂat. If in addition countable direct sums exist and are exact, then the ﬂat objects
in pChpEq,b, S0pkqq are also the complexes F‚ that for each n P N, Fn is ﬂat
Proof. Let

be a short exact sequence in Ch˚pEq. Let F‚ be a complex. Then the nth row of
/ 0

/ X‚ b F‚

/ Y‚ b F‚

/ Z‚ b F‚

is

0

i`j“n Xi b Fj

i`j“n Yi b Fj

i`j“n Zi b Fj

/ 0

/À

Since the direct sums involved are exact, this sequence is short exact if for each i, j,

0

/ Xi b Fj

/ Yi b Fj

/ Zi b Fj

/ 0

is short exact. It follows immediately that a complex whose entries are ﬂat in E is itself a ﬂat object in
Ch˚pEq. To see that a ﬂat complex must have ﬂat entries, simply take a short exact sequence in E, and
regard it as a short exact sequence in Ch˚pEq concentrated in degree 0.
(cid:3)

We are going to use Theorem 4.18. In order to deal with the third condition of that theorem we are going

to need the following notion.
Deﬁnition 5.10. An acyclic complex F‚ P ChpEq is said to be b-stably acyclic if for any complex X‚,
F‚ b X‚ is acyclic. An acyclic complex F‚ P ChpEq is said to be Hom-stably acyclic if for any complex
X‚, HompF‚ b X‚q is acyclic.
Proposition 5.11. Let F be a ﬂat object in E. Then for all n, the complex DnpFq is b-stably acyclic.
In particular, split exact complexes of ﬂat objects are b-stably acyclic. If F is projective then DnpFq is
Hom-stably acyclic. Hence split exact complexes of projectives are Hom-stably acyclic.

Proof. Clearly it is suﬃcient to prove the proposition for n “ 1. In this case, D1pFqb X‚ – F b conepidX‚q.
(cid:3)

Since F is ﬂat this complex is acyclic. The proof for projectives is similar.

We would also like our model structure to satisfy the monoid axiom. Towards this we note the following.

Proposition 5.12. Let E be a cocomplete elementary exact category. Then transﬁnite compositions of
quasi-isomorphisms in ChpEq are quasi-isomorphisms.
Proof. The proof is by transﬁnite induction. Since a ﬁnite composition of quasi-isomorphisms is a quasi-
isomorphism, the successor part of the induction is ﬁnished. Now let λ be a limit ordinal and F : λ Ñ ChpEq
a continuous functor. For α ď β ď λ denote by fα,β the map Fα Ñ Fβ. For β ď λ write fβ “ f0,β. It is
clear that

conepfλq – limÑβăλconepfβq

Since each fβ is a quasi-isomorphism, conepfβq is acyclic. Since E is elementary, this implies limÑβăλconepfβq
is acyclic, which would mean that conepfλq is acyclic and hence that fλ is a quasi-isomorphism.

Theorem 5.13. Let E be a projectively monoidal exact category with enough projectives. Then the projective
model structure on Ch`pEq is monoidal.
If E also has kernels, then the projective model structure on
Chě0pEq is monoidal. If in addition E is elementary then Chě0pEq satisﬁes the monoid axiom.
Proof. By Propososition 5.9 the coﬁbrant objects are ﬂat. By Lemma 4.22, all coﬁbrations are pure. Now
since ProjpEq is closed under b, dg
˜ProjpEq is closed under b by Lemma 4.29. Now let L, L1 be dg
˜ProjpEq-
complexes with L1 acyclic. We have to show that L b L1 is acyclic. However any complex in
˜ProjpEq is a
split exact complex of objects in ProjpEq. By Proposition 5.11 such an object is b-stably acyclic.
For the assertions about the monoid axiom, we must check the conditions of Theorem 4.24. The ﬁrst
condition is guaranteed, again because the trivially coﬁbrant objects are b-stably acyclic. The second
(cid:3)
condition follows from Proposition 5.12 and by Proposition 4.44.

We would like a version for unbounded complexes. We are going to prove the following.

Theorem 5.14. Let pE,b, kq be a bicomplete closed, monoidal elementary exact category such that arbitrary
product functors are admissibly exact and and arbitrary coproduct functors are admissibly coexact. Then
pChpEq,b, Hom, S0pkqq is a monoidal model category which satisﬁes the monoid axiom.
Proof. The condition on products and coproducts guarantee that pChpEq,b, Hom, S0pkqq is actually a
monoidal exact category. Now the proof goes through in almost exactly the same way as Proposition 5.13.
˜ProjpEq.
All that remains to prove is that the tensor product of two complexes in dg

This is a consequence of the proposition below, and its corollary.

˜ProjpEq is again in dg

Proposition 5.15. If X‚ is in dg

is acyclic. Moreover S0pPq P dg

˜ProjpEq, so HompS0pPq, Y‚qis acyclic by assumption. Now

quasi-abelian category HompX‚, Y‚q is acyclic.
Corollary 5.16. If X‚ and Z‚ in dg

ProjpEq. Let Y‚ be an acyclic complex.

Let us recall the Dold-Kan correspondence for abelian categories. The exposition here follows [Wei95] 8.4.

For an abelian category A, there are functors

and

constructed as follows:

Given an object A P sA set

Deﬁne a diﬀerential δn “ p´1qndn : N An Ñ N An´1. It follows from the simplicial relations that N A‚ is a
chain complex. Moreover, since by deﬁnition a map of simplicial objects commutes with the face maps, this
construction is functorial.

The construction of Γ is more involved. For a chain complex C P Chě0pAq, one sets

where for η : rns (cid:16) rps, Cη “ Cp. Given a morphism α : rns Ñ rms in ∆, deﬁne a morphism ΓpCqpαq :
ΓmpCq Ñ ΓnpCq by its restriction Γpα, ηq : Cη Ñ ΓpCq to each summand Cη as follows. For each surjection
η : rns Ñ rps we consider its epi-mono factorisation η1 of ηα.

If p “ q so that ηα “ η1 then we take Γpα, ηq to be the natural identiﬁcation of Cη with the summand Cη1

composition

Otherwise we take Γpα, ηq to be 0.

The Dold-Kan Correspondence says the following

The constructions of Γ and N make sense in any exact category which has kernels. Thus for an exact

category E with kernels we get functors

and

constructed mutatis mutandis as above.

Corollary 5.18 (Dold-Kan for Exact Categories). Let E be an exact category with kernels. Then the functors

and

form an equivalence of categories.
Proof. Pick a left abelianization I : E Ñ A. Then I extends to functors sE Ñ sA and Chě0pEq Ñ Chě0pAq,
which we will also denote by I. Since I preserves kernels we get a commutative diagram.

If A “ Ab is just the category of abelian groups, then there is a well-known model structure on the
category sAb. The weak equivalences (resp. ﬁbrations) are those maps of simplicial abelian groups which
are weak equivalences (resp. ﬁbrations) on the underlying simplicial set. As usual, the coﬁbrations are
maps of simplicial abelian groups which have the left-lifting property with respect to the trivial ﬁbrations.
Moreover, the category Ab is an elementary abelian category. As a set of tiny projective generators we can
take P “ tZu. Thus there is a projective model structure on Chě0pAbq. In this case the functors N and Γ
also form a Quillen equivalence between these model categories. For a proof see [GJ09] Chapter 3 Section
2. The model structure on sAb is a special case of a much more general model structure.

Notation 5.19.

(1) Let Z be an object in a category C . We denote by sZ the constant simplicial object

in sC which is Z in each degree, and such that the face and degeneracy maps are all idZ.

(2) If C is additive, then the category sC is enriched over sAb in an obvious way. We denote the enriched

hom functor by HomsC

Theorem 5.20. Suppose that C is a small bicomplete category, and let Z “ tZi : i P Iu be a set of compact
objects of C. Then sC is a simplicial model category with A Ñ B a weak equivalence (respectively ﬁbration)
if and only if the induced map

is a weak equivalence (respectively ﬁbration) for all I P I.
Proof. See [GJ09] Theorem 6.9.

HomsCpsZi, Aq Ñ HomsCpsZi, Bq

(cid:3)

In particular if E is a small bicomplete elementary exact category, then there is a model category structure
on sE where for the set Z in Theorem 5.20 we take a generating set P of tiny projective objects. We shall
call this the projective model structure on sE. We are now going to show the following

Theorem 5.21 (Model Dold-Kan for Elementary Exact Categories). Let E be a small bicomplete elementary
exact category. Endow Chě0pEq and sE with their projective model structures. Then the functors

Γ : Chě0pEq Ñ sE

and

form a Quillen equivalence.

We use the following notion:

N : sE Ñ Chě0pEq

Deﬁnition 5.22. Let M , N be model categories. M is said to be generated by a collection of functors
tFi : M Ñ N uiPI if a map f : X Ñ Y in M is a ﬁbration (resp. weak equivalence) if and only if Fipfq is a
ﬁbration (resp. weak equivalence) for each i P I.

By construction the model structure on sE is generated by the functors

tHomsEpsP,´q : sE Ñ sAbuPPP

where we endow sAb with its projective model structure.

The model structure on Chě0pEq is generated by a similar set of functors:

Proposition 5.23. Let E be an elementary exact category with a projective generating set P. The projective
model structure on Chě0pEq is generated by the functors

tHompS0pPq,´q : Chě0pEq Ñ Chě0pAbq : P P Pu

where we endow Chě0pAbq with its projective model structure.
Proof. The ﬁbrations in Chě0pEq are the degree-wise admissible epics in positive degree, and the ﬁbrations
in Chě0pAbq are the degree-wise epics in positive degree. Let f‚ : X‚ Ñ Y‚ be a morphism in Chě0pEq.
Then the components of HompS0pPq, f‚q are HomEpP, fnq. Now f‚ is a ﬁbration if and only if each fn is
an admissible epimorphism for n ą 0. This is true if and only if HomEpP, fnq is an epic for each n ą 0 and
each P P P, i.e. if and only if HompS0pPq, f‚q is a ﬁbration for each P P P.
It is clear that HompS0pPq, conepf‚qq – conepHompS0pPq, f‚qq. Now by Corollary 3.4, conepf‚q is acyclic
if and only if HompS0pPq, conepf‚qq is acyclic for all P P P. Equivalently, f‚ is a weak equivalence if and
only if HompS0pPq, f‚q is a weak equivalence for each P P P.
(cid:3)

With these structures in hand, we will use the following result in order to prove the theorem.

Proposition 5.24. Let M , N , M 1, N 1 be model categories. Suppose M is generated by functors tFi : M Ñ
N uiPI , and M 1 is generated by functors tF 1
i : M1 Ñ N 1uiPI . Let G : M Ñ M 1 and H : M 1 Ñ M be adjoint
functors
Suppose also that there is a Quillen adjunction P % Q, with P : N Ñ N 1 and Q : N 1 Ñ N such that for
each i P I the diagram

G % H

Proof. We need to show that H preserves (acyclic) ﬁbrations. Let f be an (acyclic) ﬁbration in M 1. By
ipfq is an (acyclic)
assumption, for each i, F 1
ﬁbration. By commutativity of the diagram

ipfq is an (acyclic) ﬁbration in N 1. Since Q is right Quillen, Q˝ F 1

Before proving the theorem, we shall make the following easy observation.

Proposition 5.25. Let M and M 1 be model categories, and G : M Ñ M 1 and H : M 1 Ñ M be Quillen
adjoint functors

G % H

Suppose further that

(1) The unit and counit maps of the adjunction are weak equivalences.
(2) G preserves weak equivalences of the form X Ñ HY where X is coﬁbrant and Y is ﬁbrant.
(3) H preserves weak equivalences of the form GX Ñ Y where X is coﬁbrant and Y is ﬁbrant.

Then G % H is a Quillen equivalence.

weak equivalence. Hence X Ñ HY is a weak equivalence.
Conversely suppose that X Ñ HY is a weak equivalence. Then GX Ñ GHY is a weak equivalence by
assumption. Also by assumption GHY Ñ Y is a weak equivalence. Thus GX Ñ Y is a weak equivalence.

The second diagram follows from the fact that HompP,´q : E Ñ Ab preserves kernels (and therefore
intersections). The ﬁrst diagram follows from the fact that HompP,´q : E Ñ Ab preserves ﬁnite direct
sums. By Proposition 5.24 the adjunction is a Quillen adjunction. Let us now check the hypotheses of
Proposition 5.25. The unit and counit maps are isomorphisms. In particular they are weak equivalences. In
the Dold-Kan correspondence for abelian groups, it can be shown that the functors N : sAb Ñ Chě0pAbq
and Γ : Chě0pAbq Ñ sAb both preserve all weak equivalences. By the commutativity of the above
diagrams, this also implies that the functors N : sE Ñ Chě0pEq and Γ : Chě0pEq Ñ sE also preserve all
(cid:3)
weak equivalences.

6. Model Structures on Algebras

In this section we will let E be a bicomplete, locally presentable additive category. We further assume
that E is endowed with an additive monoidal model structure which satisﬁes the monoid axiom and is
combinatorial. We do not assume that either the model structure or the monoidal structure are compatible
with the exact structure. An additive category satisfying all of the above assumptions will be called a higher
algebra setting (HAS) (c.f. the notion of HAG in [TV04]). An HAS is said to be a strong HAS if there
is a set of generating acyclic coﬁbrations which are split monomorphisms with trivially coﬁbrant cokernel.
Example 6.1. Let pE,b, Hom, kq be a locally presentable closed monoidal elementary exact category. Then
pChě0pEq,b, Hom, S0pkqq is a strong HAS. If countable coproducts are admissibly coexact and countable
products are admissibly exact then pChpEq,b, Hom, S0pkqq is also a strong HAS.
6.1. Model Structures on Monoids and Modules.

6.1.1. Modules.
Proposition 6.2. Let pE,b, kq be a HAS and let R be a commutative monoid in E. Then with its transferred
model structure and induced closed symmetric monoidal structure, (R ´ Mod,bR, HomRq is a HAS. If
pE,b, kq is a strong HAS then so is (R ´ Mod,bR, HomRq.

Proof. The transferred model structure exists by Theorem B.17. and is coﬁbrantly generated by Corollary
B.16. Also by Theorem B.17 it is monoidal and satisﬁes the monoid axiom. R-Mod is locally presentable by
[Mes14]. Finally, let I be a set of generating acyclic coﬁbrations for E which are split monomorphisms. Then
tidR b i : i P Iu is a set of generating acyclic coﬁbrations in R-Mod. Tensoring with R clearly preserves
split exactness of a sequence, so R-Mod also has a set of generating acyclic coﬁbrations which are split
(cid:3)
monomorphisms with trivially coﬁbrant cokernel.

Let pE,b, Hom, kq be a locally presentable closed monoidal elementary exact category. Suppose that
countable coproducts are admissibly coexist and countable products are admissibly exact and let R be a
commutative monoid in E. By Proposition 3.23 R-Mod is again an elementary exact category, and it is
locally presentable.. Thus ChpR ´ Modq is equipped with a combinatorial projective model structure, and
has a set of generating acyclic coﬁbrations which are split monomorphisms with trivially coﬁbrant cokernel.
However the induced monoidal structure on R-Mod, namely ´ bR ´ need not be compatible with the
exact structure. This one of our motivations for considering higher algebra settings rather than just pseudo-
compatible model structures on monoidal exact categories. We also want to consider model structures on
modules over commutative diﬀerential graded algebras.. It is however useful to know that in these cases the
model structures are left pseudo-compatible (resp. compatible).

6.1.2. Associative Monoids. The next result follows immediately from Theorem B.17
Proposition 6.3. Let E be a HAS. Then the transferred model structure exists on AsspEq.
6.1.3. Commutative Monoids. Now we turn to commutative monoids. If a (strong) HAS E is enriched over
VectQ rather than just Ab, we shall call it a (strong) Q-HAS.
Proposition 6.4. Let E be a strong Q-HAS. Then the transferred model structure on CommpEq exists.
Proof. The forgetful functor CommpEq Ñ E preserves ﬁltered colimits. Thus we may apply Corollary
B.16. The transferred model structure exists on AsspEq by Proposition 6.3.
In particular the functor
T : E Ñ AsspEq preserves acyclic coﬁbrations. By Proposition A.1, for any map X Ñ Y in E, the map
SpXq Ñ SpY q is a retract of TpXq Ñ TpY q. In particular if X Ñ Y is an acyclic coﬁbration in E, then
SpXq Ñ SpY q is a weak equivalence in E. Now suppose g is a generating acyclic coﬁbration in E. We may
assume g is an inclusion as a direct summand, i.e. of the form X Ñ X ‘ Z where Z is trivially coﬁbrant.
Since S is a left adjoint it preserves colimits, so SpX‘ Zq – SpXqb SpZq, and Spgq is the map idSpXqb 1SpZq
where 1SpZq is the unit of the commutative monoid SpZq. Consider a push-out diagram

SpXq
Spgq

SpXq b SpZq

/ A

Spgq1

/ B

Then B is isomorphic to AbSpXqpSpXqbSpZqq – AbSpZq and under this isomorphism Spgq1 is idAb1SpZq.
Any transﬁnite composition of such maps will again be of the form t : A Ñ A b SpY q with Y trivially
coﬁbrant, since both b and S preserve colimits and coproducts of trivially coﬁbrant objects are trivially
coﬁbrant. Now 0 Ñ Y is a weak equivalence between coﬁbrant objects. Thus k “ Sp0q Ñ SpY q is a weak
equivalence. Moreover tensor products, coproducts, and retracts of (trivially) coﬁbrant objects are (trivially)
coﬁbrant. Hence SpY q is trivially coﬁbrant. Since the model structure on E is monoidal,p´q b A preserves
(cid:3)
weak equivalences between coﬁbrant objects. In particular t is a weak equivalence.

6.1.4. Lie Monoids. Finally we turn to Lie monoids.
Proposition 6.5. Let pE,b, kq be a Q-HAS. Then the transferred model structure exists on LiepEq
Proof. Let f : X Ñ Y be a generating trivial coﬁbration in E and suppose

composition of pushouts of images Lpgq of generating acyclic coﬁbrations g, then Upmq is a transﬁnite
composition of pushouts of images Tpgq of generating acyclic coﬁbrations g. By Theorem 6.3 and Theorem
B.14 Upmq is acyclic. But m is a retract of Upmq by Theorem A.2. Hence m is also a weak equivalence. (cid:3)

7. Concluding Remarks

7.1. Relaxing the Assumptions. We are being somewhat lazy by assuming the existence of abelian
embeddings. Many of the results we prove using this assumption likely also hold under other, sometimes easier
to check assumptions such as existence of kernels, idempotent completeness or even just weak idempotent
completeness. Buehler makes a similar remark with regard to his result in [B¨uh11].

7.2. Comparisons With Other Work.

7.2.1. The Injective Model Structure.
Deﬁnition 7.1. Let E be an exact category. If it exists, the injective model structure on Ch˚pEq, for
˚ P t`, b,Hu is the model structure in which

‚ Weak equivalences are quasi-isomorphisms.
‚ Coﬁbrations are degree-wise admissible monics.
‚ Fibrations are maps which have the right lifting property with respect to acyclic coﬁbrations.

In [ˇSt’12] introduces the notions of eﬃcient exact categories and exact categories of Grothendieck type.

Deﬁnition 7.2. A exact category E is said to be eﬃcient if

(1) E is weakly idempotent complete.

(2) Transﬁnite compositions of admissible monics exist and are admissible monics.

(3) Every object of E is tiny relative to the class of all admissible monics.

(4) E has an admissible generator.

Remark 7.3. Locally presentable elementary exact categories are eﬃcient.
Deﬁnition 7.4. Let E be an exact category, and S a class of objects in E. An S-ﬁltration is diagram
X : λ Ñ E for some ordinal λ, such that X0 “ 0 and for each α ` 1 ă λ, there is a short exact sequence

0

/ Xα

fα,α`1/

/ Xα`1

/ Sα

/ 0

with Sα P S. An object X P E is said to be S-ﬁltered if 0 Ñ X is the transﬁnite composition of some
S-ﬁltration. The class of all S-ﬁltered objects is denoted by FiltS. A class F of objects in E is said to be
deconstructible if there exists a set S of objects of E such that F “ FiltS.
Deﬁnition 7.5. An exact category E is said to be of Grothendieck type if it is eﬃcient and is deconstru-
cible in itself.

Theorem 7.11 in [ˇSt’12] then says the following.

Theorem 7.6. Let E be an exact category of Grothendieck type such that W, the class of acyclic complexes
in ChpEq is deconstructible in ChpEq. Then the injective model structure exists on ChpEq. Moreover it is
a compatible model structure.

It is not clear to us whether the categories we are interested in, namely CBornk and IndpBankq are of

Grothendieck type.

Appendix A. Algebra in Symmetric Monoidal Categories

Throughout this section pC ,b, kq is a symmetric monoidal category, with monoidal functor b. The
symmetric braiding will be denoted by σ. We further assume that C is ﬁnitely bicomplete. What follows is
largely standard. Much of it can be found in [BBK13] for example.

A.1. Associative Monoids. We denote the category of (unital) associative monoids internal to C by
AsspCq. There is a faithful forgetful functor | ´ |Ass : AsspCq Ñ C .
If C has countable products then
| ´ | has a left adjoint T which can be constructed explicitly. Namely for V P C , set

where by deﬁnition T0pV q “ V b0 “ k. Now b preserves colimits in each variable, so

TnpV q “ V bn

TpV q “ 8à
TpV q b TpV q – 8à

n“0

TnpV q

TmpV q b TnpV q

m,n“0

The multiplication
is deﬁned on the summand TmpV q b TnpV q by the composition

m : TpV q b TpV q Ñ TpV q

TmpV q b TnpV q – Tm`npV q Ñ TpV q

where the isomorphism TmpV q b TnpV q “ V bm b V bn – V bpm`nq “ Tm`npV q is the natural isomorphism.
The identity is given by the inclusion e : k “ T0pV q Ñ TpV q. m and e endow TpV q with the structure of a
unital associative monoid. It is clear that V Ñ TpV q is functorial in V , and it is straightforward to check
that T is left adjoint to | ´ |.
A.2. Commutative Monoids. We denote the category of (unital) commutative monoids by CommpCq.
If C has ﬁnite coequalizers and countable coproducts then the forgetful functor | ´ |Comm : CommpCq Ñ C
has a left-adjoint, which can be constructed explicitly as follows. The symmetric group on n letters Σn acts
on TnpV q “ V bn. Let SnpV q “ TnpV qΣn be the coinvariants for this action. We then set

SpV q “ 8à

n“0

SnpV q

The associative monoid structure on TpV q descends to an associative monoid structure on SpV q. One checks
easily that it is commutative and that it is a left adjoint.
A.3. Modules. Given objects A and B of AsspCq we denote by A ´ Mod the category of left modules for
A, by Mod´ A the category of right modules for A, and by A´ Mod´ B the category of A´ B bimodules.
There is a forgetful functor | ´ |A´Mod : A ´ Mod Ñ E. This functor has a left adjoint. It sends an
object E to the object A b E with the obvious left action of A.

Let E be a right A-module with action morphism

aE : E b A Ñ E

and F a left A-module with action morphism

aF : A b F Ñ F

If the category C has ﬁnite equalisers, then we deﬁne

E bA F

to be the equaliser of the maps

E b A b F

aE

aF

4 E b F

63

This deﬁnes a bifunctor

bA : Mod ´ A ˆ A ´ Mod Ñ C

If E is a B ´ A bimodule and F is an A´ C bimodule, then E bA F is naturally a B ´ C-bimodule, i.e. bA
gives a bifunctor

B ´ Mod ´ A ˆ A ´ Mod ´ C Ñ B ´ Mod ´ C

If A is a commutative monoid then this gives a bifunctor

A ´ Mod ˆ A ´ Mod Ñ A ´ Mod

which endows A ´ Mod with a monoidal structure.
Suppose further that the monoidal structure is closed, and let Homp´,´q denote the internal hom functor.
Then one can also construct an internal hom, HomAp´,´q functor on A´ Mod by a similar method as used
to construct bA. This makes pC ,bA, HomAp´,´q, Aq a closed monoidal category. See for example [BBK13]

for details.
A.4. Lie Monoids. Now we suppose pE,b, kq is a monoidal additive category. Then one can deﬁne the
category of Lie monoids internal to E. Denote the symmetric braiding by σ. A Lie monoid in E is a pair
pL,r´,´sq consisting an object L of E together with a morphism r´,´s : L b L Ñ L satisfying the Jacobi
identity

r´,r´,´ss ` r´,r´,´ss ˝ pidL b σL,Lq ` r´,r´,´ss ˝ pσL,L b idLq ˝ pidL b σL,Lq “ 0

and the antisymmetry condition

r´,´s ` r´,´s b σL,L “ 0

Morphisms of Lie monoids are deﬁned in the obvious way. This gives a category LiepEq of Lie monoids
internal to C .
There is of course a forgetful functor | ´ |Lie : LiepEq Ñ E. If E is enriched over VectQ rather than Ab
we will also see that this functor has a left adjoint L which can be constructed explicitly.
Now let A be an associative monoid in E with multiplication m. Deﬁne r´,´s : A b A Ñ A by r´,´s “
m´ m˝ σA,A. It is easy to see that pA,r´,´sq is a Lie monoid. Moreover this structure is clearly functorial,
and we get a faithful functor AsspEq Ñ LiepEq. As we shall see later, if E is enriched over VectQ then this
functor has a left adjoint U .

A.5. Algebra in VectQ-Enriched Symmetric Monoidal Categories. We now assume that our monoidal
additive category E is enriched over VectQ rather than just Ab. We also assume that E is ﬁnitely bicomplete
and has countable coproducts. Let us relate the functors U, L, T, S.
The easiest identity is U ˝ L – T . This follows from the fact that both U ˝ L and T are left adjoints to
the forgetful functor | ´ |Ass : AsspEq Ñ E.
Now consider T and S. The following is an easy generalisation of the same fact for Q-vector spaces. It is

done for dg-vector spaces in [Qui69] for example.
Proposition A.1. The natural transformation | ´ |Ass ˝ T Ñ | ´ |Comm ˝ S admits a section.
Proof. Let V be an object of E. Deﬁne a map ρV : TpV q Ñ TpV q of graded objects in E by

ÿ

σPΣn

ρV, n “ 1
n!

σ : TnpV q Ñ TnpV q

*

64

JACK KELLY

This clearly induces a map
which is a section of the projection TnpV q Ñ SnpV q. It is also clear that ρV is natural in V , i.e. we get a
natural transformation ρ : |´|Comm ˝ S Ñ |´|Ass ˝ T which is a section of |´|Ass ˝ T Ñ |´|Comm ˝ S (cid:3)
Let us now explain how U and S are related. In [DEF`99] it is shown that if E is Q-linear then a left

adjoint U to the forgetful functor AsspEq Ñ LiepEq exists, and there is a natural isomorphism

TnpV qΣn “ SnpV q Ñ TnpV q

| ´ |Ass ˝ U – | ´ |Comm ˝ S ˝ | ´ |Lie

UpLq is called the universal enveloping algebra of L. The proof in fact works in the following setup
Theorem A.2 (Poincar´e-Birkhoﬀ-Witt). Let pE,b, kq a monoidal additive category enriched over VectQ
with countable coproducts and ﬁnite coequalizers. Then a left adjoint U to the forgetful functor AsspCq Ñ
LiepCq exists, and there is a natural isomorphism

| ´ |Ass ˝ U – | ´ |Comm ˝ S ˝ | ´ |Lie

Corollary A.3. Let g be a Lie monoid and let i : g Ñ Upgq denote the natural map in E. Then the map
g Ñ Impiq is an isomorphism.

Finally we relate U and L. First we give an explicit construction of L. Consider the tensor algebra
TpV q as a Lie algebra with Lie bracket r´,´s the one induced from the associative algebra structure. Let
L0pV q “ V ãÑ TpV q. Inductively deﬁne a subobject Lr`1pV q of TpV q as the image of the restriction of
r´,´s to V b LrpV q. Deﬁne

LpV q “ 8à

r“0

LrpV q

The Lie bracket on TpV q pulls back to one on LpV q. The construction is clearly functorial. To see that it is
a left adjoint we follow the method of [S`71]. Suppose g is a Lie monoid and V Ñ g is a morphism in E.
This induces a morphism V Ñ g Ñ Upgq and therefore a morphism of associative algebras TpV q Ñ Upgq.
The image of LpV q under this map is clearly contained in the image of g in Upgq. But by Corollary A.3 this
is isomorphic to g. Thus we get a lift of V Ñ g to a map of Lie algebras LpV q Ñ g. Such a map is clearly
unique.
We are going to show that the natural inclusion LpV q ãÑ TpV q is split. First we introduce some notation.
Let g be a Lie monoid with bracket r´,´s. Deﬁne r´,´sn : gbn Ñ g inductively as follows. We set
r´,´s1 “ r´,´s and deﬁne r´,´sn`1 to be the composite.

gbn`1

idgbr´,´sn /

r´,´s

/ g b g

/ g

We then get the following result, which is a generalisation of Lemma 2.2 in [Qui69].

Lemma A.4. The graded natural transformation ρ : | ´ |Ass ˝ T Ñ | ´ |Lie ˝ L of graded objects in E given
by

"

is a left inverse for the map LpV q Ñ TpV q.
Proof. Fix an object V of E. Denote the Lie bracket on LpV q by r´,´s. Deﬁne a Lie monoid endomorphism
D of LpV q whose action on LnpV q is multiplication by n. Consider the Lie monoid L1pV q “ LpV q ‘ k with
Lie bracket

r´.´s1 : pLpV q ‘ kq b pLpV q ‘ kq – LpV q b LpV q ‘ LpV q ‘ LpV q ‘ k Ñ LpV q ‘ k

The inclusion LpV q Ñ LpV q‘ k is a morphism of Lie monoids whose image is an ideal of LpV q‘ k. Thus

LpV q ‘ k is an LpV q-module, and hence a UpLpV qq “ TpV q module. Consider the composition

TpV q – TpV q b k Ñ TpV q b L1pV q Ñ L1pV q

In degree n this map is nρn. But when restricted to LnpV q it is given by Dn “ nidLnpV q. Thus ρn|LnpV q “

Appendix B. Model Categories

B.1. Weak Factorization Systems and Model Structures. Here we brieﬂy recall the deﬁnition of a
model structure by means of weak factorisation systems. Details can be found in [Rie14].
Deﬁnition B.1. Let C be a class of morphisms in a category M. A morphism f in M is said to have the
left lifting property with respect to C if in any diagram of the form

A

f

/ C

c

with c P C, there exists a morphism h : B Ñ C such that the following diagram commutes

B

/ D

A

h

f

/ C

c

We denote the class of all morphisms which have the left-lifting property with respect to C by ˝äC.
Dually one deﬁnes the morphisms having the right lifting property with respect to C. The class of all such
morphisms is denoted C ˝ä.

B

D

The following is straightforward

Proposition B.2. Let C be a class of morphisms in a category M. Then ˝äC is closed under retracts,
push-outs and transﬁnite composition (whenever they exist).

Proof. See [Rie14] Lemma 11.1.4.
Deﬁnition B.3. A weak factorisation system on a category C is a pair pL,Rq such that

(1) Any map in C can be factored as a map in L followed by a map in R.
(2) L “ ˝äR and R “ L ˝ä.

A weak factorisation system is said to be functorial if the factorisation in p1q can be made functorial.

(cid:3)

We can now give a deﬁnition of the notion of a model structure in terms of weak factorisation systems.
Deﬁnition B.4. A model structure on a category M is a collection of three wide subcategories pC,F,Wq
such that

(1) The class W satisﬁes the 2-out-of-6 property (see [Rie14]).
(2) Both pC X W,Fq and pC,W X Fq are weak factorization systems.
We do not assume completeness or cocompleteness of M.

Deﬁnition B.5. A model structure on a category M is said to be functorial if the factorisation systems
are functorial.

Deﬁnition B.6. A (functorial) model category a category together with a (functorial) model structure.

B.2. Coﬁbrant Generation. We state here our conventions regarding coﬁbration generation.
Deﬁnition B.7. Let C be a category. A weak factorisation system pL,Rq on C is said to be coﬁbrantly
small if there is a set I of maps in L such that R “ I ˝ä. I is called a set of generating morphisms. If
in addition I admits the small object argument then the weak factorisation system is said to be coﬁbrantly
generated. If I can be chosen such that the domains are tiny, then the weak factorisation system is said to
be cellular. If C is locally presentable and coﬁbrantly small, then the weak factorisation system is said to be
combinatorial. A model category pC,W,Fq is said to be coﬁbrantly small coﬁbrantly generated/ cellular/
combinatorial if both the weak factorisation systems pC,FXWq and pCXW,Fq are coﬁbrantly small/ cellular/
combinatorial.

Remark B.8. A coﬁbrantly small weak factorisation system (resp. model structure) on a locally presentable
category is automatically coﬁbrantly generated.

B.3. Monoidal Model Categories.
Deﬁnition B.9. Let M,N ,P be model categories. A bifunctor ´ b ´ : M ˆ N Ñ P is said to be left
Quillen if whenever i : m Ñ m1 and j : n Ñ n1 are coﬁbrations then so is i ˆbj, and it is an acyclic coﬁbration
if either i or j is. Here i ˆbj is the following map
ib1 /

m1 b n

m b n
1bj
m b n1

1bj

i ˆbj

m1 b n1

P

ib1

where the square is a push out.

Deﬁnition B.10. A (closed) monoidal model category is a (closed) symmetric monoidal category
pV,b, kq (pV,b, k, Homq) with a model structure so that the monoidal product is a left Quillen bifunctor,
and the maps

and

Qpkq b v Ñ k b v – v
v b Qpkq Ñ v b k – v

are weak equivalences whenever v is coﬁbrant. Here Q is the coﬁbrant replacement functor.

Another condition that is often asked of a monoidal model category is that it satisﬁes the so-called monoid
axiom. Under certain additional technical assumptions on the model category, this guarantees the existence
of a model structure on the category of algebras over any coﬁbrant operad.
Deﬁnition B.11. A monoidal model category pV,b, k, Homq is said to satisfy the monoid axiom if every
morphisms which is obtained a a transﬁnite composition of pushouts of tensor products of acyclic coﬁbrations
with any object is a weak equivalence.

B.4. Transferred Model Structures.
Deﬁnition B.12. Let D and E be categories with D a model category. Suppose F : D Ñ E and G : E Ñ D
are functors with F % G. If it exists, the transferred model structure on E is the one deﬁned as follows.

(1) A map f in E is a weak equivalence precisely if Gpfq is a weak equivalence in D.
(2) A map f in E is a ﬁbration precisely if Gpfq is a ﬁbration in D.

(3) A map f in E is a coﬁbration precisely if it has the left lifting property with respect to acyclic

coﬁbrations.

Remark B.13. If the transferred model structure exists on E then F % G is a Quillen adjunction.

We need the following important result, which is Theorem 3.3 in [Cra95].

Theorem B.14. Let D and E be categories, with D a cocomplete cellular model category and E having ﬁnite
limits and all colimits. Suppose F : D Ñ E and G : E Ñ D are functors with F % G. If F preserves tiny
objects, then the transferred model structure on E exists if and only if the weak equivalences in E contain
any sequential colimit of pushouts of images Fpgq, where g is allowed to vary over the generating trivial
coﬁbrations in D. Moreover the transferred model structure is cellular.

Remark B.15. Note that in [Cra95] it is actually proved that if an adjunction satisfying the above condition
then the transferred model structure exists. The converse is clear however since as a left Quillen functor F
preserves acyclic coﬁbrations and colimits.

We will actually use the following immediate corollary.

Corollary B.16. Let D and E be categories, with D a cococomplete cellular model category and E having
ﬁnite limits and all colimits. Suppose F : D Ñ E and G : E Ñ D are functors with F % G. If G preserves
ﬁltered colimits, then the transferred model structure on E exists if and only if the weak equivalences in E
contain any transﬁnite composition of pushouts of images Fpgq, where g is a generating trivial coﬁbration in
D. Moreover the transferred model structure is cellular.
B.5. Algebra in Monoidal Model Categories. Let pC ,bq be a monoidal model category. We recall here
a major result regarding the existence of transferred model structures on categories of monoids and modules
internal to C .
Theorem B.17 ([SS00]). Let pC ,bq be a bicomplete monoidal model category and R a monoid object in C .
Suppose that

(1) pC ,bq satisﬁes the monoid axiom.

(2) C is a combinatorial model category.

Then

(1) The transferred model structure on R ´ Mod exists and is coﬁbrantly generated.

(2) If R is commutative, then the transferred model structure on R-Mod is monoidal and satisﬁes the

monoid axiom.

(3) If R is commutative then the transferred model structure exists on the category of monoids in R-
Mod. Moreover it is coﬁbrantly generated. Every cofribration of R-algebras whose source is coﬁbrant
is also a coﬁbration of R-modules.

Proof. This is Theorem 4.1 in [SS00].
