ON THE GYROKINETIC LIMIT FOR THE

TWO-DIMENSIONAL VLASOV-POISSON SYSTEM

EVELYNE MIOT

Abstract. We investigate the gyrokinetic limit for the two-dimensional Vlasov-
Poisson system in the regime studied by Golse and Saint Raymond [12] and
by Saint-Raymond [26]. We present another proof of the convergence towards
the Euler equation under several assumptions on the energy and on the L∞
norms of the initial data.

1. Introduction and main results

The purpose of this paper is to investigate an asymptotic regime for the fol-

lowing Vlasov-Poisson system as ε tends to zero:

fε(0, x, v) = f 0

Here, fε = fε(t, x, v) : R+ × R2 × R2 → R+ stands for the density of a two-
dimensional distribution of electric particles, called a plasma. The evolution of
the plasma in the plane is submitted to the self-consistent electric ﬁeld Eε(t, x)
and to a large external and constant magnetic ﬁeld, orthogonal to the plane,
which is represented by the term v⊥ = (v1, v2)⊥ = (−v2, v1). The limit ε → 0
corresponds to the situation where the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld tends to
inﬁnity. In the periodic setting, namely (x, v) ∈ T × R2, the gyrokinetic limit
was studied by Golse and Saint-Raymond [12], then by Saint-Raymond [26], and
also by Brenier [6] in a diﬀerent regime. In particular, Golse and Saint-Raymond
proved that under suitable bounds on the initial data1, the sequence of spatial
densities (ρε)ε>0 is relatively compact in2 L∞(R+,M+(T×R2)) weakly ∗ and that
any accumulation point ρ is a measure-valued solution3to the 2D Euler equation

Adapting the classical Cauchy theory for the Vlasov-Poisson equation [2, 20, 24]
for any ε > 0, one obtains a unique global weak solution fε to (1.1) belonging to
L∞(R+, L1∩ L∞(R2)), compactly supported, such that fε(0) = f 0
ε . In particular,
loc(R+, L∞(R2)). Finally, the energy
the associated spatial density ρε belongs to L∞
and the Lp norms of the solution are non-increasing in time.

Our main result on the asymptotics of (1.1) can be then stated as follows:

Theorem 1.1. Let f 0
ε satisfy (1.3), (1.4) and (1.5). Let fε be the corresponding
global weak solution to (1.1). There exists a subsequence εn → 0 as n → +∞
such that (ρεn)n∈N converges to ρ in4 C(R+,M+(R2)− w∗). Moreover, ρ belongs
to L∞(R+, H −1(R2)) and it is a global solution of the 2D Euler equation(1.2) in
the sense of Deﬁnition 2.1.

Theorem 1.1 is a slight improvement of the convergence result in [26], which

handles initial densities satisfying (1.3), (1.4) and (1.6):

(1.6)

as ε → 0.

Typically, the assumption (1.5) allows for initial data such that for some β > 1

Thus, Theorem 1.1 includes initial data that converge to monokinetic data:

t 7→ R φ(x) dρ(t, x) is continous, for all ϕ ∈ Cc(R2).

Theorem 1.2. Let f 0

global weak solution to (1.1). There exists a subsequence εn → 0 as n → +∞
such that (ρεn)n∈N converges to ρ in C(R+, L2(R2) − w). Moreover,

(1) ρ ∈ L∞(R+, L2(R2));
(2) (Eεn)n∈N converges to some E in C(R+, L2

distributions.

Besides the already mentioned articles by Golse and Saint-Raymond [12] and
Saint-Raymond [26], a wide literature has been devoted to the mathematical
analysis of the Vlasov equation in the limit of large magnetic or electric ﬁeld.
Brenier [6] derived the Euler equation in a diﬀerent scaling, for smooth and
well-prepared data, by means of a diﬀerent method based on the modulated
energy. Various asymptotic regimes for linear or non linear Vlasov equations
were investigated by Fr´enod and Sonnendr¨ucker [9, 10, 11], Golse and Saint-
Raymond [13, 25], Han-Kwan [15], Ghendrih, Hauray and Nouri [17], Hauray
and Nouri [16], and more recently by Bostan, Finot and Hauray [5] and by Barr´e,
Chiron, Goudon and Masmoudi [3]. The convergence results in [12, 26] rely
on the derivation of an equation for the spatial density with a good control of
the large velocities. Here, the main ingredient of proof is based on a diﬀerent
weak formulation for the spatial density, following from the ODE satisﬁed by a
suitable combination of the characteristics along which the density is essentially
constant, see Proposition 2.7. This approach actually amounts to focusing on the
equation satisﬁed by the shifted density fε(t, x − εv⊥, v), see Proposition 2.11.
These so-called gyro-coordinates (x − v⊥, v) were used in [17] (see also [16]) for
the derivation of a gyrokinetic model from a linear Vlasov equation. We also
mention that a similar change of variable in the space variable, in addition to a
transformation by rotation in the velocity variable, has been considered in [11]
and in the recent work [5].

2. Proof of Theorem 1.1

2.1. Vortex sheet solution of the Euler equation. We ﬁrst deﬁne the notion
of weak solution to the Euler equation (1.2), called vortex sheet solution, which
is invoked in Theorem 1.1.
Deﬁnition 2.1 (According to [7, 27]). Let ρ0 ∈ M+(R2)∩H −1(R2) be compactly
supported. We say that ρ ∈ C(R+,M+(R2) − w∗) ∩ L∞(R+, H −1(R2)) is a
global weak solution of the Euler equation with initial datum ρ0 if we have for
c (R+ × R2)
all Φ ∈ C ∞

EVELYNE MIOT

For any compactly supported ρ0 in M+(R2) ∩ H −1(R2), global existence of
a corresponding vortex sheet solution (satisfying a slightly diﬀerent formulation
than the one above) was established by Delort [7]. The formulation of Deﬁni-
tion 2.1, which has been introduced later by Schochet [27], is motivated by the
observation that when ρ is a bounded and integrable map,

(2.1)

hdiv(E⊥ρ), ΦiD′,D = −ZZ HΦ(x, y)ρ(x)ρ(y) dx dy.

Moreover, HΦ is deﬁned and continuous oﬀ the diagonal ∆ = {(x, x)|x ∈ R2} and
bounded on R2 × R2, since kHΦkL∞(R2×R2)) ≤ kΦkW 2,∞ . Hence the expression
(2.1) makes sense for ρ as in Deﬁnition 2.1, since the atomic support a positive
measure in H −1 is empty [7].

2.2. Uniform a priori estimates. In all the remainder of this section, fε de-
notes the global weak solution of (1.1) with initial data f 0
ε satisfying (1.3), (1.4)
and (1.5). Replacing kf 0
ε kL∞ ) if necessary, we will always
assume that

ε kL∞ by max(1,kf 0

kf 0

ε kL∞ ≥ 1.

The purpose of this paragraph is to collect a priori estimates and basic properties
for fε for later use. The notation C will stand for a constant independent of ε,
changing possibly from a line to another.

Proposition 2.2. We have

sup
t∈R+

sup
ε>0

(kfε(t)kL1 + H(fε(t))) < +∞,

and

sup
t∈R+

ε2Θ(kfε(t)kL∞ ) ≤ ε2Θ(kf 0

ε k) → 0,

as ε → 0.

Proof. This is an immediate consequence of the fact that for (1.1), the energy
and the norms of fε satisfy

∀t ∈ R+, H(fε(t)) ≤ Hε(0),

kfε(t)kLp ≤ kf 0

ε kLp.

Proposition 2.3. We have for all t ∈ R+ and for all 0 < ε < 1

Proof. Let T > 0 and Rε > 0 such that supp(fε(t)) is included in B(0, Rε) ×
B(0, Rε) on [0, T ]. We set ϕ(x, v) = (cid:0)|x|2 + 2εx · v⊥(cid:1) χ(|x|/Rε)χ(|v|/Rε), where
χ is a smooth cut-oﬀ function such that χ = 1 on B(0, 1) and χ = 0 on B(0, 2)c.
For t ∈ [0, T ), we compute using the weak formulation of (1.1) for the test

We omit the dependence on t for simplicity. Setting

Proposition 2.5. We have

sup
t∈R+

sup

ε>0 kEε(t) − ˜EεkL2 < +∞.

Proof. The computations below are quite standard and we perform them for sake
of completeness. We ﬁrst integrate by parts, using that Eε(t) − ˜Eε = 2π∇G ∗
(ρε(t) − ˜ρε), with G the fundamental solution of the Laplacian in R2. Then we
expand, which yields

Proposition 2.6. We have Eε − ˜Eε ∈ L∞(R+, H 1(R2)) and

sup

In particular, for all q ≥ 2 we have

sup

t∈R+ kEε(t) − ˜EεkLq ≤ C√qkf 0

ε k1/2
L∞.

Proof. On the one hand, kEε(t) − ˜EεkL2 ≤ C by virtue of Proposition 2.5. On
the other hand, standard elliptic regularity theory yields a constant C > 0 such
that

where we have used Proposition 2.4 and (2.2) in the last inequality.

Finaly, the second statement follows from the Sobolev embedding theorem
H 1(R2) ⊂ Lq(R2) for all q ≥ 2, with the dependence of the constant with respect
to q given in, e.g., [19, Paragraph 8.5, p. 206].

Therefore, the DiPerna and Lions theory [8] applies, providing a unique La-
grangian ﬂow associated to bε, which we denote by (Xε, Vε). We refer to the
recent survey [1] or to [4], which handles speciﬁcally the Vlasov-Poisson case. In
particular, for almost every (x, v) ∈ R2 × R2, t 7→ (Xε(t, x, v), Vε(t, x, v) is an

the desired estimate.

2.4. Passing to the limit. We establish a property of uniform equicontinuity
with respect to time for the spatial densities.
Lemma 2.9. There exists K0 > 0 such that for all s, t ∈ R+,

Proof. This is a simple consequence of Proposition 2.8 and of the estimate |HΦ(x, y)| ≤
kΦkW 2,∞ .

(cid:3)

We are now in position to complete the proof of Theorem 1.1. A straightfor-

ward adaptation of Ascoli’s theorem yields:

Lemma 2.10. Let T > 0. Let (F, d) be a complete metric space. Let (fn)n∈N be
a family of C([0, T ], F ) such that

12

EVELYNE MIOT

(1) For all t ∈ [0, T ], (fn(t))n∈N is relatively compact in F ;
(2) There exists C > 0 and a sequence rn → 0 as n → +∞ such that for all

t, s ∈ [0, T ], for all n ∈ N, |fn(t) − fn(s)| ≤ C|t − s| + rn.

Then the family (fn)n∈N is relatively compact in C([0, T ], F ).

Using the fact that (ρε)ε>0 is uniformly bounded in L∞(R+,M+(R2)) and
recalling Lemma 2.9, we can apply this Lemma to F = W −2,1(R2) and we can
mimick the proof of Lemma 3.2 in [27, Lemma 3.2] to show that there exists εn →
0 as n → +∞ such that (ρεn)n∈N converges to some ρ in C(R+,M+(R2) − w∗).
By Proposition 2.5, (ρεn)n∈N is bounded in L∞(R+, H −1(R2)). It was proved in
[7] (see also [22, 27]) that this implies that the non-linear term

Z ZZ HΦ(x, y)ρεn(s, x)ρεn(s, y) dx dy ds

converges to

Z ZZ HΦ(x, y)ρ(s, x)ρ(s, y) dx dy ds

as n → +∞ for all test function Φ. On the other hand, all linear terms appearing
in the formulation given by Proposition 2.8 pass to the limit. This means that ρ
satisﬁes the conclusion of Theorem 1.1.

2.5. Alternative proof of Theorem 1.1 without Lagrangian trajectories.
The purpose of this paragraph is to propose another proof of Theorem 1.1, for
smooth solutions, that does not rely on the characteristics. Here, we assume that
the initial data f 0

ε satisfy the assumptions of Theorem 1.1 and that moreover

f 0
ε ∈ C 1,α(R2 × R2)

for some α ∈ (0, 1). The corresponding solution to (1.1) then belongs to C 1(R+×
R2 × R2).
As in [17], we consider the microscopic and macroscopic densities in the gyro-
coordinates:

fε(t, x, v) = fε(t, x − εv⊥, v),

ρε(t, x) =ZR2

fε(t, x, v) dv.

Proposition 2.11. We have

and

Proof. We compute

∂tfε(t, x, v) = ∂tfε(t, x − εv⊥, v), ∇xfε(t, x, v) = ∇xfε(t, x − εv⊥, v),
∇vfε(t, x, v) = (ε∇⊥

3. Proof of Theorem 1.2

In this section we adapt the proof of Theorem 1.1 to the case of initial data

(3.1)

satisfying the assumptions of Theorem 1.2. We have

ε>0 kfε(t)kL∞ < ∞,
hence it follows from Propositions 2.4 and 2.6 that

ε>0 kρε(t)kL2(R2) < ∞,

sup

ε>0 kEε(t) − ˜EεkH 1(R2) < ∞.

Exactly as in Subsection 2.4, the family (ρε)ε>0 is relatively compact in C(R+,M+(R2)−
w∗). Moreover, (ρε(t))ε>0 is weakly relatively compact in L2(R2) for all t ≥ 0.
It follows that for some subsequence εn → 0, (ρεn)n∈N converges to some ρ in
C(R+, L2(R2)−w) and in C(R+,M+(R2)−w∗) as n → +∞. Let E = (x/|x|2)∗ρ,
so that E belongs to L∞
