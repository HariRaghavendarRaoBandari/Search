Abstract

We consider the problem of determination of the neutrino mass
ordering via precise study of the vacuum neutrino oscillations in the
JUNO and other future medium baseline reactor neutrino experi-
ments. We are proposing to resolve neutrino mass ordering by deter-
mination of the neutrino oscillation parameters from analysis of the
data of the reactor experiments and comparison them with the oscil-
lation parameters obtained from analysis of the solar and KamLAND
experiments.

The establishment of the character of the neutrino mass ordering (normal
or inverted?) is one of the major problem of future high precision neutrino
oscillation experiments. This problem will be investigated via observation of
matter eﬀects in the accelerator T2K [1] and NOvA [2], atmospheric PINGU
[3] and ORCA [4] and other neutrino experiments.

The measurement of the angle θ13 in the accelerator T2K [5] and in the re-
actor Daya Bay [6], RENO [7] and Double Chooz [8] experiments opened the
way of the determination of the neutrino mass ordering by the investigation
of the vacuum neutrino oscillations in reactor neutrino experiments.

Dependence of the probability of reactor νe’s to survive on the neutrino
mass ordering (NMO) was noticed in the paper [9], in which reactor CHOOZ
data were analyzed in the framework of three-neutrino mixing, and in the
paper [10].

The neutrino mass ordering can be revealed in experiments in which eﬀect
of both solar and atmospheric mass-squared diﬀerences (∆m2
A) can
be observed. It was shown in [11, 12] that this condition can be realized in
medium baseline reactor neutrino experiments with source-detector distance
20-30 km. Later in numerous papers (see [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]) a possibility
to determine the neutrino mass ordering in reactor experiments was analyzed
in details. It was established that the optimum baseline is about 50-60 km
and energy resolution must be

S and ∆m2

3%√E(M eV )

or better.

1

Two ambitious medium baseline reactor neutrino experiments JUNO [18]
in China and RENO-50 [19] in Korea were proposed. The JUNO experiment
is now under construction.
In this experiment 20 kton liquid scintillator
detector will be located at the distances ∼ 53 km from two nuclear power
plants. It is planned that the data taking in this experiment will be started
in 2020.

Let us consider the three-neutrino mixing

νlL =

3

X

i=1

UliνiL

(l = e, µ, τ ),

(1)

where νlL (l = e, µ, τ ) is the ﬂavor neutrino ﬁeld, νi is the ﬁeld of neutrino
(Dirac or Majorana) with mass mi and U is a unitary 3 × 3 PMNS [20, 21]
mixing matrix which is characterized by three mixing angles θ12, θ23, θ13 and
one CP phase δ. As it is well known, in this case two neutrino mass spectra
are possible.

Usually, neutrino masses are labeled in such a way that for both spectra

m2 > m1 and ∆m2

12 = ∆m2

S > 0 is solar mass-squared diﬀerence.1

Possible neutrino mass spectra are determined by the m3 mass. There

are two possibilities

1. Normal ordering (NO) m3 > m2 > m1.

2. Inverted ordering (IO) m2 > m1 > m3.

Following the standard procedure, for the probability of ¯νe to survive in

vacuum we have

P (¯νe → ¯νe) = 1 − 2 X

i>k

|Uei|2|Uek|2(1 − cos 2∆ki).

Here

∆ki =

kiL

∆m2
4E

,

(2)

(3)

where L is the distance between neutrino source and detector and E is the
neutrino energy. Taking into account that

|Ue1|2 = cos2 θ13 cos2 θ12,

|Ue2|2 = cos2 θ13 sin2 θ12,

|Ue3|2 = sin2 θ13

(4)

1We will use the following deﬁnition of the mass-squared diﬀerence: ∆m2

ki = m2

i − m2
k.

we have

P (¯νe → ¯νe) = 1 − cos4 θ13 sin2 2θ12 sin2 ∆S

−
2

sin2 2θ13 (cid:2)cos2 θ12(1 − cos 2∆13) + sin2 θ12(1 − cos 2∆23)(cid:3) .

(5)

Only last term of this expression, proportional to the small parameter sin2 2θ13,
depends on the neutrino mass ordering.

In the case of three neutrino masses, there are two independent mass-
squared diﬀerences. Three neutrino mass-squared diﬀerences in (5) (for both
mass spectra) satisfy the following identity

∆m2

13 = ∆m2

23 + ∆m2

12.

From (6) we have

|∆m2

13| = |∆m2

23| ± ∆m2
S,

where ± corresponds to NO(IO), respectively. Thus, we have
cos 2∆13 = cos 2|∆23| cos 2∆S ∓ sin 2|∆23| sin 2∆S.

(6)

(7)

(8)

From (5) and (8) for the ¯νe survival probability we obtain the following

expression [22]

P (¯νe → ¯νe) = 1 − cos4 θ13 sin2 2θ12 sin2 ∆S

1
2

−

sin2 2θ13[1 − a cos(2|∆23| ± φ)].

(9)

Here

sin φ =

1
a

where

cos2 θ12 sin 2∆S,

cos φ =

1
a

(cos2 θ12 cos 2∆S + sin2 θ12),

(10)

a = p1 − sin2 2θ12 sin2 ∆12

(11)

and ± correspond to NO and IO, respectively.
The expressions (9), (10), (11) were used in several recent papers (see
[22, 23, 24, 25]) to estimate the sensitivity of the JUNO experiment to the
neutrino mass ordering.2
It was suggested in these papers that the only

2Similar expression was used in [26] for the estimation of the sensitivity of the RENO-50

experiment to NMO.

diﬀerence between NO and IO is the sign before the phase φ in the expression
(9).3 Let us notice, however, that the parameter |∆m2
23| also depends on the
neutrino mass ordering. In fact, we have
|∆m2

23| = ∆m2
where atmospheric mass-squared diﬀerence ∆m2

A is determined as follows

|∆m2

23| = ∆m2

A + ∆m2

A NO,

(12)

IO,

S

∆m2

A = ∆m2

23 NO, ∆m2

A = |∆m2
13|

IO.

(13)

From our point of view neutrino oscillation parameters must be determined
in a NMO independent way. Neutrino mixing angles, CP phase and ∆m2
S
are determined in such a way. The atmospheric mass-squared diﬀerence
∆m2
A, determined by (13), (but not the parameter |∆m2
23|) also satisﬁes this
criteria.
From (5) and (13) for the ¯νe survival probability for the normal and

inverted mass ordering we have, correspondingly,

P N O(¯νe → ¯νe) = 1 − cos4 θ13 sin2 2θ12 sin2 ∆S

− sin2 2θ13 (cid:2)cos2 θ12 sin2(∆A + ∆S) + sin2 θ12 sin2 ∆A(cid:3) .

and

P I O(¯νe → ¯νe) = 1 − cos4 θ13 sin2 2θ12 sin2 ∆S
− sin2 2θ13 (cid:2)cos2 θ12 sin2 ∆A + sin2 θ12 sin2(∆A + ∆S)(cid:3) .

(14)

(15)

There are several possibilities to choose NMO independent atmospheric mass-
squared diﬀerence (see [32]). If ∆m2

A is determined as in [29]

∆m2

A = ∆m2

13 NO, ∆m2

A = |∆m2
23|

IO

(16)

for the ¯νe survival probability in the case of NO and IO we have

P N O(¯νe → ¯νe) = 1 − cos θ4
− sin2 2θ13 (cid:2)cos2 θ12 sin2 ∆A + sin2 θ12 sin2(∆A − ∆S)(cid:3)

13 sin2 2θ12 sin2 ∆S

and

P I O(¯νe → ¯νe) = 1 − cos θ4
− sin2 2θ13 (cid:2)cos2 θ12 sin2(∆A − ∆S) sin2 θ12 sin2 ∆A(cid:3) .

(18)

solely through the phase shift φ...”

13 sin2 2θ12 sin2 ∆S

(21)

Let us notice that the atmospheric neutrino mass-squared diﬀerence, deter-
mined in (13) and (16), diﬀer by ∆m2
S and the atmospheric neutrino mass-
squared diﬀerence, determined in (19), diﬀers from the atmospheric mass-
squared diﬀerence determined in (13) and (16) by 1
S. In the era of high
presicion neutrino oscillation experiments this diﬀerence is important. From
our point of view a consensus must be found and one universal atmospheric
neutrino mass-squared diﬀerence have to be determined (see [32]).

2 ∆m2

It follows from comparison of (14) and (15) ( (17) and (18) and (21))
that P N O(¯νe → ¯νe) ⇆ P I O(¯νe → ¯νe) if we change cos2 θ12 ⇆ sin2 θ12. This
is a natural symmetry of the expressions for ¯νe transition probabilitities if
the atmospheric mass-squared diﬀerence is determined in NMO independent
way (see [9]). This symmetry suggest a possible way for the establishment of
the neutrino mass ordering. Let us assume that atmospheric mass-squared
diﬀerence was determined as in (12). We can rewrite the equations (14) and
(15) in the form

P (¯νe → ¯νe) = 1 − cos4 θ13 sin2 2θ12 sin2 ∆S
− sin2 2θ13 (cid:2)(1 − X) sin2(∆A + ∆S) + X sin2 ∆A(cid:3) .

(22)

Here

X = sin2 θ12 (NO); X = cos2 θ12 (IO).

(23)
The value of the parameter tan2 θ12 is known from analysis of the data of the
KamLAND and solar neutrino experiments. From the latest three-neutrino
analysis of the data it was found [34]

tan2 θ12 = 0.437+0.029
−0.026

(24)

5

Thus, in order to reveal the neutrino mass ordering we need to determine from
analysis of the data of future medium baseline reactor neutrino experiments
the parameter X and to check whether X is equal to

or

sin2 θ12 = 0.304 ± 0.014

cos2 θ12 = 0.696 ± 0.014.

In the ﬁrst case neutrino mass ordering is the normal one and in the second
it is the inverted one.

It was shown in [23, 18] that after six years of data taking the parameters
sin 2θ12, ∆m2
A will be determined in the JUNO experiment with
accuracy better than 1%. From the latest result of the Daya Bay experiment
it was found [35]

S and ∆m2

(25)

(26)

(27)

sin2 2θ13 = 0.084 ± 0.005.

Apparently, the future high precision JUNO and RENO-50 experiments and
future knowledge of the neutrino oscillation parameters will allow to distin-
guish the values in (25) and (26).
