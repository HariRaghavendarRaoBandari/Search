GENERALIZED BIPYRAMIDS AND HYPERBOLIC VOLUMES OF TILING LINKS

NATHANIEL MAYER, AND MIA SMITH

Abstract. We present explicit geometric decompositions of the complement of tiling links, which are alter-
nating links whose projection graphs are uniform tilings of S2, E2, or H2. This requires generalizing the angle
structures program of Casson and Rivin for triangulations with a mixture of ﬁnite, ideal, and truncated (i.e.
ultra-ideal) vertices. A consequence of this decomposition is that the volumes of spherical tiling links are
precisely twice the maximal volumes of the ideal Archimedean solids of the same combinatorial description.
In the case of hyperbolic tiling links, we are led to consider links embedded in thickened surfaces Sg × I with
genus g ≥ 2. We generalize the bipyramid construction of Adams to truncated bipyramids and use them to
prove that the set of possible volume densities for links in Sg × I, ranging over all g ≥ 2, is a dense subset
of the interval [0, 2voct], where voct ≈ 3.66386 is the volume of the regular ideal octahedron.

1. Introduction

For many links L embedded in 3-manifolds M , the complement M − L admits a unique hyperbolic struc-
ture. In such cases we say that the link is hyperbolic, and denote the hyperbolic volume of the complement
by vol(L), leaving the identity of M implicit. Computer programs like Jeﬀ Weeks’ SnapPea allow for easy
numerical computation of these volumes, but simple theoretical computations are rare. In [CKP15a], Cham-
panerkar, Kofman, and Purcell present an explicit geometric decomposition of the complement of the inﬁnite
square weave, the inﬁnite alternating link whose projection graph is the square lattice W (see Figure 1),
into regular ideal octahedra, one for each square face of the projection. The volume of the inﬁnite link
complement is inﬁnite, but it is natural to study instead the volume density, deﬁned as D(L) = vol(L)/c(L)
where c(L) is the crossing number. For inﬁnite links with symmetry like W, we can make this well deﬁned by
taking the volume density of a single fundamental domain. Since faces of W are in bijective correspondence
with crossings, the decomposition of [CKP15a] shows the volume density to be D(W) = voct ≈ 3.66386, the
volume of the regular ideal octahedron.

Figure 1. The inﬁnite square weave link W, a tiling link derived from the 4.4.4.4 tiling of
the Euclidean plane.

In this paper we generalize their example and give explicit geometric decompositions and volume density
computations for all tiling links, alternating links whose projection graphs are uniform tilings of the sphere
(embedded in S3), the Euclidean plane (in R3), or the hyperbolic plane (in R2 × I).
In the latter two
cases, we avoid working directly with inﬁnite links by taking a quotient of the inﬁnite link complement by a
discrete subgroup of the symmetry group, yielding a ﬁnite link complement in a thickened torus T × (0, 1)
for Euclidean tilings and thickened higher genus surfaces for hyperbolic tilings, denoted Sg × I where g is the
genus. These surfaces are permitted to be non-orientable, in which case the genus is deﬁned as g = (2− χ)/2
where χ is the Euler characteristic. This deﬁnition diﬀers from the standard “non-orientable genus” by a
factor of 2, with the beneﬁt that all surfaces of a given genus have equal Euler characteristic, though in
exchange surfaces may have half-integer genus. When the speciﬁc genus is unimportant, we use S × I to
denote any thickened surface of genus g ≥ 2. The crossing number of a link in S× I is deﬁned as the minimal

number of crossings across all possible projections onto S × {0}. It was proven in [AFLT02] that c(L) is
realized for a reduced alternating projection of L onto S × {0}.
The analysis of hyperbolic tiling links yields independent results about link complements in S × I. We
show that volume densities for links in S× I are bounded above by 2voct. For links in Sg × I with ﬁxed genus
g ≥ 2, the volume density is bounded by a number βg < 2voct, related to the volume of generalized hyperbolic
n-bipyramids with all dihedral angles π/2. These bipyramid volumes are bounded by and asymptotically
approach voctn/2, and the bounds βg correspondingly approach 2voct for large g. We show that tiling links
derived from the 4-regular hyperbolic (8g − 4)-gon tilings achieve the maximal volume density βg for each
g, and use these to prove the set of all possible volume densities in S × I is dense in the interval [0, 2voct].
As a corollary to the proof, we have that volume densities for links in the thickened torus T × (0, 1), known
to be bounded above by voct, are in fact dense in the interval [0, voct]. This extends previous results that
volume densities are dense in [0, voct] for knots in S3 [Bur15], [ACJ+15].

Our decomposition is based on work in [Ada15a], which in turn is based on a construction due to D.
Thurston, breaking up the complement of a link in S3 into octahedra using one at each crossing. These
octahedra have two ideal vertices, located on the cusps at that crossing, and four ﬁnite vertices which
are identiﬁed in pairs to two ﬁnite points. The two points are thought of as being far above and below
the projection sphere for the link, and we denote them U and D. Any such octahedron has volume less
than voct, so this gives an upper bound on the volume of the link, vol(L) ≤ voctc(L). The bound can
be improved slightly by collapsing edges or drilling, though asymptotically there exist links whose volume
densities approach voct [CKP15a].

In [Ada15a], the octahedral decomposition is rearranged into face-centered bipyramids. Thurston’s octa-
hedra are cut open along the core vertical line connecting the ideal vertices, yielding four tetrahedra. The
tetrahedra each have two ideal and two ﬁnite vertices, identiﬁed with U and D. The edge connecting the
ﬁnite vertices passes through the center of one of the four faces adjacent to the crossing for that octahedron,
as shown in Figure 2. This edge is shared by one tetrahedron from each crossing bordering that face, which
glue together to form a bipyramid. The apexes of the bipyramids are the ﬁnite vertices U and D, while the
vertices around the central polygon are ideal. Any such n-bipyramid has volume less than the maximal vol-
ume ideal n-bipyramid, shown in [Ada15a] to be regular, with volume bounded above by and asymptotically
approaching 2π log(n/2). These bipyramids are denoted Bideal
. The construction puts an upper bound on
volume

where ni denotes the number of edges in the i-th face of the projection of L, and drilling or collapsing allows
the removal of the two largest bipyramids from the sum. For link projections whose faces have many edges,
this gives a dramatically better bound than Thurston’s octahedra.

Much of this paper is devoted to generalizing the bipyramid decomposition for links in T × (0, 1) and
S × I, and then exploiting the symmetry of tiling links to precisely determine the dihedral angles in the
complete hyperbolic structure.
In Section 2, we present relevant background on generalized hyperbolic
polyhedra and extend the angle structures program of Casson and Rivin to allow for a mixture of ﬁnite,
ideal, and truncated (i.e. ultra-ideal) vertices. Section 3 deals with the maximal volumes for certain classes

of generalized polyhedra which appear in the generalized octahedral and bipyramidal decompositions. These
results are then applied in Section 4 to tiling links, allowing us to calculate exact volume densities for all links
associated to 3- or 4-regular uniform tilings. Section 4 also contains results on the set of volume densities
for links in thickened surfaces.

2. Generalized angle structures

A generalized hyperbolic tetrahedron is the convex hull of four points which may be ﬁnite (within H3),
ideal (on ∂H3), or ultra-ideal (outside H3 ∪ ∂H3). Ultra-ideal points ﬁt most naturally into the Klein ball
model of H3. Given an ultra-ideal point x outside the unit sphere in R3, consider the cone of lines through
x tangent to the sphere. The canonical truncation plane associated to x is the plane containing the circle
where that cone intersects the sphere. Geodesic lines and planes through the ultra-ideal point are computed
as Euclidean lines and planes through the point as usual, cut oﬀ at the truncation plane (see Figure 3).
Note that all edges of the tetrahedron that passed through x before truncation are prependicular to the
corresponding truncation plane. For more background on ultra-ideal points, see, e.g., [Ush06].

We will often prefer to work in the Poincar´e ball model for computing lengths and angles. Since the
two models agree on the sphere at inﬁnity, we can do this by using the Klein model to locate the ideal
boundaries of geodesic lines and planes, and then construct the geodesics corresponding to those boundaries
in the Poincar´e model.

Figure 3. The canonical truncation of an ultra-ideal point in the Klein ball model.

A generalized hyperbolic tetrahedron is fully determined by its six dihedral angles. We can thus specify
a tetrahedron with a vector ∆ = (A, B, C, D, E, F ) ∈ [0, π]6, with the dihedral angles labelled as in Figure
4. We restrict our attention to mildly truncated tetrahedra, those in which truncation planes for distinct
ultra-ideal vertices do not intersect within H3. It should be understood that all truncated tetrahedra in this
paper are mildly truncated. In this case there is a formula for the volume of a generalized tetrahedron in
terms of its dihedral angles.

The generalized volume formula in terms of the angles is unwieldy, but the total diﬀerential takes an
elegant form in terms of the edge lengths. This is Schl¨aﬂi’s diﬀerential formula, in the three-dimensional
case (see, e.g. [Sch50], [Kel89]).

Theorem 2.2 (Schl¨aﬂi’s diﬀerential formula). Given a generalized hyperbolic tetrahedron ∆ with dihedral
angles θi and corresponding edge lengths (cid:96)i, the diﬀerential of the volume function is given by

Let M be a compact hyperbolic 3-manifold, either without boundary or with totally geodesic boundary,
and let T be a triangulation of M by a collection of tetrahedra which may have ﬁnite, ideal, or ultra-ideal
vertices. An angle structure on T is an assignment of dihedral angles in the range [0, π] to each edge in each
tetrahedron, such that

(i) the sum of the dihedral angles around any one edge equals 2π, and
(ii) the sum of the three dihedral angles incident to an ideal vertex in a single tetrahedron equals π.
(iii) the sum of the dihedral angles around an ultra-ideal vertex is less than π.
(iv) the sum of the dihedral angles incident to a ﬁnite vertex is greater than π.
An angle structure on a triangulation consisting of n tetrahedra is thus given by a vector Θ ∈ A ⊂ [0, π]6n,
where A is a bounded open set deﬁned by the above constraints. The total volume of the tetrahedra in
an angle structure is denoted vol(Θ). Casson and Rivin’s original program deals exclusively with ideal
triangulations, but their key results hold in this more general context.
Theorem 2.3. Let A be the space of angle structures for a triangulation of a compact hyperbolic 3-manifold
M , boundaryless or with totally geodesic boundary. Then a critical point of the volume functional on A gives
a complete hyperbolic structure for M .

Proof. The case where all vertices are ideal is Rivin’s original result, proofs of which can be found in [Riv94]
and [FG11].

Triangulations with a mixture of ideal and ultra-ideal vertices are discussed in [LST08], [LY14] and by
Frigerio and Petronio in [FP04]. Most of the discussion there applies equally well to triangulations with ﬁnite
vertices. They show that an angle structure gives a complete hyperbolic structure (with totally geodesic
boundary if applicable) if and only if it satisﬁes four conditions:

(i) The sum of the dihedral angles around a single edge is 2π.
(ii) Identiﬁed faces are isometric.
(iii) There are no shearing singularities around edges with two ideal endpoints.
(iv) A completeness condition is satisﬁed at each cusp.
Condition (i) is part of the deﬁnition of an angle structure, so it is satisﬁed automatically.
In most cases, Condition (ii) is satisﬁed if identiﬁed vertices are of the same type and all ﬁnite lengths
of identiﬁed edges in identiﬁed faces are equal. This is true at any critical point of the volume functional.
Suppose e and e(cid:48) are identiﬁed edges with ﬁnite lengths (i.e. no ideal endpoints), with corresponding
dihedral angles θ and θ(cid:48). Then there is a deformation vector in the tangent space of A which increments θ
and decrements θ(cid:48). At a critical point of the volume functional on A, we have

and substitution by the Schl¨aﬂi formula gives

(cid:96)e = (cid:96)e(cid:48).

Thus glued edges between ﬁnite vertices must have the same edge lengths. However, we must still account
for those ﬁnite lengths that are generated by truncation, i.e. which lie along the truncation plane. In these
cases, the Schl¨aﬂi formula and hyperbolic geometry imply that the ﬁnite truncation edges have equal lengths.
We discuss one such case and leave the rest to the enterprising reader. In cases which involve ideal vertices,
the argument must be modiﬁed by considering the distance between concentric horocycles as described below
for exceptional hexagons.

Consider a face with one ﬁnite vertex A and two ultra-ideal vertices U1 and U2 as in Figure 5. We let (cid:96)1
denote the length of e1 and so on. By isometries we may assume that the ﬁnite vertex A is at the origin,
and that one of the ultra-ideal vertices U1 lies on the y-axis below it. The Schl¨aﬂi formula then gives that

1

(cid:96)1 = (cid:96)(cid:48)
(cid:96)2 = (cid:96)(cid:48)
2
(cid:96)3 = (cid:96)(cid:48)
3.

Deﬁne a geodesic hyperplane G perpendicular to the edge from A to U1 such that the distance from G to A
is (cid:96)1. Consider the inside (cid:96)3 banana neighborhood of G and the (cid:96)2 neighborhood of A. As A was taken to be
the origin, the (Euclidean) radius of a geodesic hyperplane tangent to the (cid:96)2 sphere around F is constant,
while along the banana neighborhood the radius of curvature of the tangent geodesic increases continuously
as the point of tangency moves inwards and decreases again once it moves out. Thus there exists at most
one (up to reﬂection) geodesic hyperplane G(cid:48) tangent to both neighborhoods and the lengths (cid:96)4 and (cid:96)5 are
determined by (cid:96)1, (cid:96)2 and (cid:96)3. Hence

(cid:96)4 = (cid:96)(cid:48)
(cid:96)5 = (cid:96)(cid:48)

and faces must then be isometric.

Vertex types and ﬁnite edge lengths are not enough to determine the isometry type of two of these classes
of generalized triangles. The ﬁrst are the so called “exceptional hexagons” from [FP04], generalized triangles
with one ideal and two ultra-ideal vertices such that the two truncation arcs are tangent, so the length of
the internal edge between them is 0. Given such a face F on a tetrahedron ∆, we call the two edges of F
incident to the ideal vertex e1 and e2, and the dihedral angles of ∆ along those edges θ1 and θ2 respectively.

(a) An “exceptional hexagon.”

(b) A triangle with one ﬁnite and two ideal vertices.

Figure 6. Triangles whose isometry types are not fully determined by their vertex types
and edge lengths.

The notion of a circle around an ideal point is captured by horocircles, which in the Poincar´e disk model
are Euclidean circles tangent to ∂H2 at their ideal “center”. The hyperbolic radius of a horocircle is always
inﬁnite, so throughout this paper the radius of a horocircle should be understood as its Euclidean radius in
the Poincar´e disk model. Two horocircles centered at the same ideal point behave appropriately as concentric
circles, which is to say that the shortest path between them is achieved by following any geodesic ending at
the ideal center. Horospheres in higher dimensions are analogous.

We consider concentric horocircles H1 and H2, centered at the ideal vertex of F , passing through the
opposite ends of e1 and e2 respectively, as shown in Figure 6a. The ﬁnite distance between H1 and H2
determines F up to isometry. If such a face F is identiﬁed to a corresponding face F (cid:48) on a tetrahedron ∆(cid:48),

e1e3e2FH2H1e3HxH0e2e1d(Hx,H0)GENERALIZED BIPYRAMIDS AND HYPERBOLIC VOLUMES OF TILING LINKS

then there is a deformation vector in the tangent space of A which increments θ1 and θ(cid:48)
2 and decrements θ2
and θ(cid:48)
1. This maintains the appropriate sum of dihedral angles incident on the ideal vertex, as well as the
sum of the angles around each edge. Using Schl¨aﬂi’s formula again, the angle structure at a critical point of
the volume functional must satisfy

thus F and F (cid:48) are isometric.

2),

The second type of problematic triangle is that with one ﬁnite vertex and two ideal vertices. As with
the exceptional hexagons, these are problematic because all edge lengths are inﬁnite. In the Poincar´e disk
model, we may assume the vertices of such a triangle are (0,±1) and (x, 0). Label the three edges e1, e2, e3
as shown in Figure 6b, with corresponding dihedral angles θ1, θ2, θ3. Consider concentric horocircles Hx and
H0, centered at (0, 1), passing through (x, 0) and the origin respectively. The triangle is determined up to
isometry by d(Hx, H0). Suppose that two such exceptional triangles F and F (cid:48) are identiﬁed. Then there
exists a vector in the tangent space of A which increments θ1, θ3, and θ(cid:48)
3. At a
critical point of the volume functional, by Schl¨aﬂi’s formula and the symmetry of the triangles we have

2, and decrements θ2, θ(cid:48)

1, θ(cid:48)

so F and F (cid:48) are again isometric.

Conditions (iii) and (iv) deal only with the ideal vertices. Every ideal vertex in a tetrahedron can be
assigned a complex shape parameter, independent of the other vertices. Those shape parameters can be
used to compute holonomy exactly as in the entirely ideal case. As shown in [FG11], conditions (iii) and
(iv) can be written solely in terms of holonomy, and they are satisﬁed at a critical point of the volume
(cid:3)
functional.

Triangulations with ultra-ideal vertices occur when considering manifolds with totally geodesic boundaries.
Under the assumption of total geodesicity of the boundary, doubling and the Mostow rigidity theorem imply
the following.

Theorem 2.4. On any manifold M there exists at most one ﬁnite-volume complete hyperbolic structure with
totally geodesic boundary.

3. Maximal generalized tetrahedra and bipyramids

Both Thurston’s octahedral construction and the bipyramid construction decompose into generalized

tetrahedra with two ideal vertices.

Lemma 3.1. Let ∆ be a tetrahedron labelled as in Figure 4 with v1 and v2 ideal vertices. For ﬁxed angle
A ∈ [0, π], the maximal volume for such a tetrahedron is achieved when the other angles are

In this case v3 and v4 are ultra-ideal.

Proof. The condition that v1 and v2 are ideal vertices imposes the constraints

B + F + D = C + E + D = π.

We use Lagrange multipliers to maximize the volume subject to those constraints.

By Schl¨aﬂi’s diﬀerential formula, those equations become

(cid:96)B = (cid:96)F
(cid:96)C = (cid:96)E
(cid:96)D = (cid:96)B + (cid:96)C.

However, all these edges have at least one ideal endpoint, so the lengths are inﬁnite. To recover useful
information from Schl¨aﬂi’s formula, we replace the ideal vertices with ﬁnite vertices ¯v1 and ¯v2 and consider
the limiting behavior as they approach the ideal points v1 and v2. That is, we require
((cid:96)D − (cid:96)B − (cid:96)C) = 0.

((cid:96)C − (cid:96)E) = lim

Up to isometries of H3 in the Poincar´e ball model, we may let v1 = (0, 0,−1), v2 = (0, 0, 1), and v4 =

(r4, 0, 0), as in Figure 7. Then v3 lies at some point

v3 = (r3 cos D sin φ, r3 sin D sin φ, r3 cos φ).

Figure 7. A truncated tetrahedron as in Lemma 3.1.

Let pB, pC, pE, pF be the endpoints of edges B, C, E, and F respectively, opposite from v1 and v2. That
is, if v4 is ﬁnite or ideal then pB = pC = v4, but if v4 is ultra-ideal then pB and pC are the intersections of
their respective edges with the truncation plane for v4, and similarly for pE and pF . The point pB lies on a
unique horosphere centered at v2, given by

x2 + y2 + (z − (1 − RB))2 = R2

B

for some RB ∈ [0, 1]. By symmetry, pC lies on an opposite horosphere of the same radius centered at v1.
Similarly pE and pF lie on horospheres of radii RE, RF around v1 and v2 respectively. As ¯v1 and ¯v2 become
ideal, (cid:96)B − (cid:96)F limits to the ﬁnite distance between the concentric horospheres of radii RB and RF , and
similarly (cid:96)C − (cid:96)E limits to the distance between concentric horospheres of radii RB and RE. Furthermore,
since we can split edge D at the origin, (cid:96)D−(cid:96)B−(cid:96)C tends to twice the distance between concentric horospheres
of radii RB and 1

2 . Thus the optimization conditions become

This is satisﬁed if v3 and v4 lie at the origin, but then ∆ is degenerate, with volume 0. Alternatively the
truncation planes for v3 and v4 must both be mutually tangent to the two horospheres of radius 1
2 centered
at v1 and v2. Therefore v3 must be equidistant from the Euclidean centers of the horospheres (0, 0,± 1
2 ), so
it must lie on the xy-plane. Thus φ = π/2. At this point we can see by symmetry of the tetrahedron and
the ideal vertex constraints that

Proof. We see immediately from the Schl¨aﬂi formula that decreasing any one angle increases the volume.
Thus among tetrahedra with two ideal vertices as described in Lemma 3.1, the maximal volume occurs when
A = 0. The other angles follow from the formulas in the lemma. The volume of this tetrahedron is voct/2. (cid:3)
In Thurston’s octahedral construction, these tetrahedra assemble into octahedra with two opposite ideal

vertices.

Corollary 3.3. The maximal volume of a generalized hyperbolic octahedron with two opposite ideal vertices
is 2voct.

Proof. A generalized hyperbolic octahedron with two opposite ideal vertices can be cut into four tetrahedral
wedges around the core line connecting the ideal vertices. All four of these wedges may be the maximal
tetrahedron described in Corollary 3.2, with the dihedral angles gluing together along the core line all equal
(cid:3)
to π/2. The volume is then 4(voct/2) = 2voct. This generalized octahedron is shown in Figure 8.

Lemma 3.1 also allows us to determine the maximal bipyramids with ideal vertices around the central

polygon and ultra-ideal apexes.

Corollary 3.4. The maximal volume generalized n-bipyramid with ideal vertices around the central polygon
is made of n identical maximal volume tetrahedra of the type described in Lemma 3.1, with angles A = 2π/n.

Proof. A generalized n-bipyramid with ideal vertices around the central polygon can be cut along its core
line into tetrahedra ∆1, ..., ∆n, each with two ideal vertices. Label the edges of each as in Figure 7, with
subscripts to distinguish the tetrahedron to which they belong. The ideal vertices on each tetrahedron dictate
the constraints

and the fact that the tetrahedra are all glued together along the core line additionally requires

We maximize using Lagrange multipliers and substitute from Schl¨aﬂi’s formula, obtaining the equations

(cid:96)Ai = (cid:96)Aj
(cid:96)Bi = (cid:96)Fi
(cid:96)Ci = (cid:96)Ei
(cid:96)Di = (cid:96)Bi + (cid:96)Ci

for all i, j. By the same logic used in the proof of Lemma 3.1, the last three equations imply that ∆i is

In this model it is apparent that (cid:96)Ai increases monotonically with Di. Thus (cid:96)Ai = (cid:96)Aj implies Di = Dj, and
consequently Ai = Aj = 2π/n. The other angles depend on Ai as in the lemma because the tetrahedra are
(cid:3)
maximal.

We refer to the bipyramids described in 3.4 as maximal doubly truncated n-bipyramids, denoted Btruncated

Some volumes of these bipyramids are shown in Figure 9b. We note that the ratio

vol(Btruncated

is strictly increasing with n, asymptotically approaching voct/2 as the tetrahedral wedges making up the
bipyramids approach the maximal wedge (with angle A = 0) discussed in Corollary 3.2. This contrasts with
the case of ideal bipyramids, where

Given a 4-regular uniform tiling of the Euclidean plane, we may deﬁne an associated tiling link (cid:101)L to

be an alternating link derived by assigning an oriented crossing to each vertex (see Figure 10a). This
deﬁnition can be generalized to 3-regular uniform tilings by choosing one of the three edges at each vertex
to “double”, which corresponds to adding bigons in the associated tiling link. This is always possible by
applying Petersen’s theorem to a fundamental domain (see, e.g. [Pet91], [Bra17]), which further ensures that
the link with bigons is invariant under some two linearly independent translations. Note that this process
can result in multiple associated tiling links, deﬁned both by how we choose chirality and where we choose

may add bigons to make it a 4-regular graph. Our results hold independently of the choice of bigons.

compact fundamental domain. We may use a similar process to obtain links derived from spherical tilings,
which correspond precisely to Archimedean polyhedra.

Figure 10. Tiling links shown with fundamental domains for appropriate surface groups.

4.1. Tiling links in thickened surfaces. To determine the appropriate ambient space in which to embed
the inﬁnite tiling links, we look for an appropriate generalization of the bipyramid decomposition of [Ada15a]
for these inﬁnite objects. After carrying out the bipyramid decomposition on a typical link L ⊂ S3, consider
a small sphere S centered around the ﬁnite point U . That sphere intersects each n-bipyramid in an n-gon,
which we call the vertex link of U in that bipyramid. All together, the vertex links of U across all the
bipyramids tile the sphere S, and that tiling is an exact copy of the projection graph of L. The same
behavior occurs around the other apex D.

In an analogous bipyramid construction for a Euclidean tiling link, the vertex links of a shared apex across
all the bipyramids should form a copy of the Euclidean projection graph, which is to say the original tiling.
However, the vertex link of a ﬁnite vertex in any convex hyperbolic polyhedron is a spherical polygon. For
the vertex links to be Euclidean polygons, the apex must be an ideal point. That is, it must lie on a cusp, and

A12

C. ADAMS, A. CALDERON, X. JIANG, A. KASTNER, G. KEHNE, N. MAYER, AND M. SMITH

since the vertex links form an inﬁnite Euclidean tiling, it must be an inﬁnite planar cusp, the boundary of a
neighborhood of inﬁnity. Thus Euclidean tiling links are most naturally embedded in R3. We may think of
the transition between the standard bipyramid decomposition and this Euclidean bipyramid decomposition
as pushing the ﬁnite points U and D out towards inﬁnity as more faces are added to the link projection.
To corroborate this notion, Champanerkar, Kofman, and Purcell prove in [CKP15b] that the complements
S3 − W (p, q) approach R3 − W as a geometric limit, where the weaving links W (p, q) are increasing ﬁnite
patches of the inﬁnite square weave W.

Similarly, for hyperbolic tiling links, the vertex links of a shared apex in the bipyramids should be
hyperbolic polygons, which forces the apex to be ultra-ideal. The bipyramids are then truncated, so the
vertex links form a hyperbolic tiling of the totally geodesic truncation plane. Thus hyperbolic tiling links are
most naturally embedded in R2 × I. It should be noted that Thurston’s octahedral construction generalizes
along with the bipyramid decomposition, simply by sending U and D to be ideal or ultra-ideal rather than
ﬁnite. Figure 11 depicts the octahedral decomposition in the ultra-ideal case.

Figure 11. The decomposition of (R2 × I) − L by truncated octahedra.

Instead of working with inﬁnite tiling links embedded in the non-compact manifolds R3 and R2 × I, we
quotient out by a discrete group of ﬁxed-point free isometries to obtain a ﬁnite link in a thickened surface.

Let (cid:101)L be a link derived from a Euclidean tiling and ﬁx a fundamental domain for a Z2 action by translations
translation direction. Taking the quotient of R3 −(cid:101)L by Z2 yields a link L in a thickened torus T × (0, 1).

which respect over- and under-crossings. Note that the symmetry group of every uniform tiling of the
Euclidean plane contains a Z2 subgroup generated by translations so such a fundamental domain always
exists, and the requirement that crossings be respected at most forces a doubling of the domain in each
Note that the link complement still exists as a subspace of S3 as we can think of T × (0, 1) as the complement
of the Hopf link in S3.

The existence of a similar process for tilings derived from hyperbolic tiling links is not as immediate. To
obtain the torus from R2 we need only ﬁnd a Z2 subgroup in the group of isometries of our tiling, but to
obtain a higher-genus surface we require a surface subgroup.
Proposition 4.1. Any 3- or 4-regular compact tiling T of the hyperbolic plane can generate a link L in a
thickened surface Sg × I of genus g ≥ 2.
Proof. Let T be any compact tiling of H2 and GT be the group of symmetries of T . We show T can be
realized as a tiling of a closed surface. Note that GT is a Coxeter group generated by reﬂections over the
sides of the fundamental domain of T . To ﬁnd a surface group by which to quotient, we employ a result of
Gordon, Long and Reid which states that a Coxeter group contains a surface group if and only if it is not
virtually free ([GLR04]).
Suppose GT is virtually free. Then there exists a free subgroup Fn < GT of ﬁnite index. As Fn is free,
its action on H2 deﬁnes the {2n,∞} paracompact tiling, and as Fn is of ﬁnite index, it has fundamental
domain composed of a ﬁnite number of fundamental domains of GT . Hence a fundamental domain for T
has an ideal vertex. But T was assumed to be compact. Thus GT contains a surface subgroup π1(Sg) for
g ≥ 2.

13

GENERALIZED BIPYRAMIDS AND HYPERBOLIC VOLUMES OF TILING LINKS

Let (cid:101)L ⊂ R2 × I be a tiling link derived from a tiling U and let T be the tiling deﬁned by the symmetries
of (cid:101)L. Note that GT will be a ﬁnite-index subgroup of GU . Taking a quotient by the action of a surface

subgroup of GT yields a link L in Sg × I.

(cid:3)
Henceforth tiling links will refer to links living in S3, T × (0, 1) or Sg × I as deﬁned above, rather than
their inﬁnite counterparts. For link complements in Sg × I, g > 1, we concern ourselves exclusively with
the case where Sg × {0} and Sg × {1} are totally geodesic. This satisﬁes the hypothesis of Theorem 2.4 to
ensure that a complete hyperbolic structure of ﬁnite volume is unique if it exists. Throughout this section,
we often repress the genus and refer to any thickened surface of genus g ≥ 2 by S × I.
The generalized octahedral and bipyramid decompositions apply in this context to give upper bounds on
the volumes of any link complements in S× I. In the octahedral upper bound, the maximal ideal octahedron
with volume voct is replaced with the maximal octahedron with two opposite ideal vertices, with volume
2voct by Corollary 3.3. In the bipyramidal upper bound, the regular ideal bipyramids Bideal
are replaced
with the maximal doubly truncated bipyramids Btruncated
For links in S3 (or T × (0, 1)), the bipyramid bound is best in comparison to the octahedral bound
when the faces in the link projection have many edges. If most of the faces have between 4 and 10 edges,
the octahedral construction gives a better bound because the tetrahedral wedges in the face-centered ideal
bipyramids have larger volume than the original wedges in the crossing-centered octahedra. (This discussion
does not consider drilling or collapsing, which for reasonably small knots can make the bipyramid bound
much stronger, see [Ada15a].)
For links in S × I, the generalized bipyramid bound is best in comparison to the generalized octahedral
bound when the faces have few edges, because the tetrahedral wedges are farthest from the maximal wedge
described in Corollary 3.2. As the number of edges in the faces grows, the bipyramid wedges approach the
maximal wedges with volume voct/2 (see Figure 9b), so the bipyramid bound approaches the octahedral
bound. In all cases the truncated bipyramid bound is better than the generalized octahedral bound.

4.2. Computing volumes of tiling links. In this section we compute the volumes for all tiling links in
appropriate thickened surfaces. We use a Lagrange multiplier argument in the spirit of Lemma 3.1 and
Corollary 3.4.

Theorem 4.2. Consider a face-centered bipyramid decomposition of the complement of a tiling link. In
the angle structure realizing the complete hyperbolic structure, the dihedral angles along edges incident to
the apex in a given bipyramid are equal to the planar angles of the corresponding polygon in the equilateral
realization of that uniform tiling.

The statement about an equilateral realization of the tiling is irrelevant in the Euclidean case, as the
angles in a uniform Euclidean tiling are independent of the side lengths. For non-Euclidean tilings, the
angles may vary signiﬁcantly. For instance, a spherical projection of a truncated cube with small triangular
faces has very diﬀerent angles than one with large triangular faces.
Proof. Let {∆n,1, ..., ∆n,kn} be the collection of tetrahedra contained in n-bipyramids for a particular n,
with angles as in Figure 7 with appropriate subscripts. Using Theorem 2.3, we determine the complete
hyperbolic structure by ﬁnding a critical point of the volume functional subject to the various constraints.
For 4-regular tilings, we use the following constraints, ranging over the indices n and i:

Dn,i + Bn,i + Fn,i = Dn,i + Cn,i + En,i = π

kn(cid:88)
(cid:88)

i=1

An,i = 2πkn

Dn,i = 2πc(L)

For 3-regular tilings, the last constraint is replaced by(cid:88)

n,i

Dn,i = πc(L),

because D edges at crossings on either side of a bigon region are identiﬁed.

n,i

14

C. ADAMS, A. CALDERON, X. JIANG, A. KASTNER, G. KEHNE, N. MAYER, AND M. SMITH

Note that these constraints are signiﬁcantly weaker than the full set of constraints required for an angle
structure. In particular we consider the sum over all D angles, and all A angles for a given n, but do not
explicitly require that those coming together at a single edge sum to 2π. The simpliﬁed constraints make
the Lagrange multiplier method more tractable, and due to the the symmetry of the tiling the end solution
will satisfy all the constraints for an angle structure.

We apply Lagrange multipliers and substitute with Schl¨aﬂi’s formula, as in Lemma 3.1 and Corollary 3.4.

The resulting equations are, for all n, i, j:

(cid:96)An,i = (cid:96)An,j
(cid:96)Dn,i = (cid:96)Bn,i + (cid:96)Cn,i + λ
(cid:96)Bn,i = (cid:96)Fn,i
(cid:96)Cn,i = (cid:96)En,i

The Lagrange multiplier λ remains unknown, but is constant across diﬀerent values of n and i. Where the
lengths are inﬁnite, the equations should be understood to hold in the limit as the relevant vertices become
ideal.

Now we focus on a single tetrahedron, and drop the indices for simplicity. As in the proof of Lemma 3.1,

we may consider each tetrahedron in the Poincar´e ball model with vertices

v1 = (0, 0, 1),

v2 = (0, 0,−1),

v4 = (r4, 0, 0),

v3 = (r3 cos D sin φ, r3 sin D sin φ, r3 cos φ).

Deﬁne pB, pC, pE, pF and RB, RE, RF as in the proof of Lemma 3.1. By the same logic used there, the
conditions (cid:96)B = (cid:96)F and (cid:96)C = (cid:96)E tell us that RB = RE = RF . We claim they also imply φ = π/2 and
r3 = r4.

The vertices v3 and v4 are identiﬁed with the points U and D. For spherical tiling links, these vertices
are ﬁnite. Thus v4 lies on the intersection of horospheres centered at v1 and v2 with radii RB, which we call
H1 and H2. Since RB = RE = RF , v3 must also lie on the intersection of those horospheres in the xy-plane,
so φ = π/2 and r3 = r4. For hyperbolic tiling links v3 and v4 are ultra-ideal. The truncation plane for v4 is
then simultaneously tangent to H1 and H2. The truncation plane for v3 must also be simultaneously tangent
to H1 and H2, which again implies φ = π/2 and r3 = r4 as in the proof of Lemma 3.1.
For Euclidean tiling links v3 and v4 are ideal, so r3 = r4 = 1, but the requirement that φ = π/2 is not as
obvious. In this case RB = 1 and H1 = H2 is the boundary sphere ∂H3. Instead we consider horospheres
H(cid:48)
1 and H(cid:48)
2 , tangent to each other at the origin. Let H4 be
a horosphere centered at v4 and tangent to H(cid:48)
1, by symmetry also tangent to H(cid:48)
2. Let H3E and H3F be
horospheres centered at v3, tangent to H(cid:48)
1 and H(cid:48)
2 respectively. Consider the hyperbolic radii of these spheres
as all the vertices limit to ideal points. Throughout the limiting process we require the spheres to maintain
the points of tangency speciﬁed. Let ρi denote the hyperbolic radius of sphere Hi, with primes as necessary.
The conditions (cid:96)B = (cid:96)F and (cid:96)C = (cid:96)E then become

where the limits are taken as the vertices become ideal. These equations then imply

lim(ρ3F − ρ3E) = 0.

That diﬀerence can be evaluated in the limit as the ﬁnite distance between the concentric horospheres H3E
and H3F . We conclude that H3E = H3F , thus φ = π/2 by symmetry.

We have established that

Now we show that every tetrahedron in the decomposition, when isometrically placed in the Poincar´e ball

model as described above, must have the same value of r4. From the Lagrange multiplier equation

(cid:96)Dn,i − (cid:96)Bn,i − (cid:96)Cn,i = λ

we know that λ is twice the distance between the horospheres H1 and H(cid:48)
λ ﬁxes the value of RB. When v4 is ﬁnite,

Each of these functions is one-to-one, so for ﬁxed RB there are at most two possibilities for r4. When there
are two possibilities, one corresponds to ﬁnite apexes for the bipyramid and the other corresponds to ultra-
ideal apexes. Since all the bipyramids share the same apexes, they must all have the same value r4. Once
r4 is ﬁxed, (cid:96)A increases monotonically with the angle D so the condition (cid:96)An,i = (cid:96)An,j forces Dn,i = Dn,j
and An,i = An,j = 2π/n. With this, all the conditions for an angle structure are satisﬁed.

Figure 12. A right triangle as in the proof of Theorem 4.2.

Finally, we show that the bipyramid angles 2Bn,i are the internal angles of n-gons in the equilateral
realization of this tiling. Consider a regular n-gon with interior angles 2B = π− D and side lengths L. Draw
a right triangle by connecting the center of the polygon to one vertex and to the midpoint of an adjacent
side (see Figure 12). The right triangle has angles A/2 and B. If it is a spherical triangle, then spherical
trigonometry tells us

Similarly if it is a hyperbolic triangle, then hyperbolic trigonometry tells us

The condition that r4 must be the same for every tetrahedral wedge thus tells us that the dihedral angles
2B of the bipyramids are the internal angles of the corresponding hyperbolic polygons in an equilateral
(cid:3)
realization of that tiling.

Theorem 4.2 allows us to easily compute the volumes of all tiling links. For spherical tilings these
volumes have additional signiﬁcance. When L is alternating, the projection graph of L gives a net for each
polyhedron. In [Men83], Menasco gives a decomposition of S3− L into two isometric polyhedra. By splitting
the bipyramidal decomposition of a spherical tiling link into top and bottom pyramids and gluing the tops
and bottoms around the vertex links of U and D, respectively, we recover Menasco’s decomposition. Thus

A/2B16

C. ADAMS, A. CALDERON, X. JIANG, A. KASTNER, G. KEHNE, N. MAYER, AND M. SMITH

for an alternating link L derived from a spherical tiling we obtain a decomposition of S3 − L into two copies
of the polyhedron associated to the spherical tiling.
Corollary 4.3. A link L ⊂ S3 corresponding to a spherical tiling has volume exactly twice that of the
maximal hyperbolic polyhedron of the same combinatorial description.

The volumes of these polyhedra are enumerated in Figure 13 along with the angles of their associated
spherical tilings.
It is interesting to note that numerical evidence shows that for a spherical tiling link,
the complete hyperbolic structure occurs at a complex critical point of the volume functional, not a simple
maximum.

that D(L) = vol(L)/c(L) > x. Thus x = vol(L)/(c(L) + d) for some real d > 0. By taking an n-fold cyclic
cover of (S × I) − L around one handle we may scale the volume and crossing number by n. Drilling out
an unknotted augmenting component around any crossing of the resulting link preserves hyperbolicity and
raises the volume by some amount bn > 0 which may depend on n and the particular choice of drilling
[Ada15b]. Then we perform (1, tn)-Dehn ﬁlling on the augmenting component, replacing the crossing with a
twist region of tn + 1 crossings to create a link L(cid:48) with volume bounded above by nvol(L) + bn and crossing
number nc(L) + tn. Set

Then, for suﬃciently large n, tn > 2π so L(cid:48) is hyperbolic and moreover,

A result of Futer, Kalfagianni, and Purcell [FKP08] provides a bound for the amount the volume can drop

where (cid:96) is the length of s. Since tn (and thus (cid:96)) increases without bound as n does, we can choose n

Note that cyclic covers of tori remain tori and hence the following result can be deduced through arguments

similar to those above.
Corollary 4.8. The set of volume densities for links in T × (0, 1) is a dense subset of the interval [0, voct].

GENERALIZED BIPYRAMIDS AND HYPERBOLIC VOLUMES OF TILING LINKS

19

Taking cyclic covers of a surface of genus g ≥ 2 increases the number of handles, prompting us to consider
the set of volume densities in surfaces of a ﬁxed genus. As mentioned in the introduction, we deﬁne the genus
for non-orientable surfaces in terms of the Euler characteristic χ as g = (2 − χ)/2, so that “ﬁxed genus”
directly translates to “ﬁxed Euler characteristic”.
Proposition 4.9. The maximum volume density for links in thickened surfaces of ﬁxed genus g ≥ 2 is given
by

βg :=

vol(B

(cid:3)
8g−4)
2g − 1

and is realized by a tiling link derived from the {8g − 4, 4} tiling in a closed non-orientable surface of genus
g.
Proof. The complement of a link L in Sg × I decomposes into c(L) generalized octahedra, which then break
up into 4c(L) tetrahedra ∆i with two ideal vertices each. Label the dihedral angles of ∆i as in Figure 7.
The ideal vertices and edge gluings around the core lines of the octahedra impose the constraints

Di + Bi + Fi = Di + Ci + Ei = π,

Di = 2πc(L).

4c(L)(cid:88)

i=1

4c(L)(cid:88)

4c(L)(cid:88)

Additionally, the truncation triangles of the tetrahedra must tile Sg ×{0} and Sg ×{1}, so by Gauss-Bonnet
we have

(π − Ai − Bi − Ci) =

(π − Ai − Ei − Fi) = −2π(2 − 2g).

Combining with the previous constraints yields

i=1

i=1

4c(L)(cid:88)

Ai = 2π(2 − 2g + c(L)).

i=1

Now we have eﬀectively the same system of constraints as in Theorem 4.2, so as then they imply Bi = Ci =
Ei = Fi = (π − Di)/2, Di = Dj, and Ai = Aj for all i and j. Plugging back in to the constraints, we get
Di = π/2, Bi = Ci = Ei = Fi = π/4.

The volume density is simply the combined volume of four of these tetrahedra, which are as large as
possible when Ai is as small as possible, which is to say when c(L) is as small as possible. By Euler
characteristic considerations, the minimum number of crossings comes from a tiling by a single (8n− 4)-gon.
The edge identiﬁcations on a single polygon which respect over- and under-crossings produce a non-orientable
(cid:3)
surface.

We conclude with a few open questions.

Question 1. Is the set of volume densities of links in Sg × I for ﬁxed genus g ≥ 2 dense in [0, βg]?

Augmentation and taking a belted sum with links in S3 leaves genus intact, and thus the set of volume
densities of links in Sg × I can be shown to be dense in [0, voct] by employing results of, e.g., [Bur15] and
[ACJ+15].

Question 2. Can bipyramidal decompositions be used to compute the volume of non-alternating tiling links?

Question 3. Can bipyramidal decompositions be used to compute the volumes of links derived from non-
uniform tilings?

In both of the preceding questions, the bipyramids are unlikely to remain regular, and some skewing factor
should be taken into account to determine the complete hyperboliic structure and calculate exact volumes.
