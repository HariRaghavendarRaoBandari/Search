Abstract

We show how to compute the spectral function for a scalar theory in two diﬀerent
scenarios: one which disregards back-reaction i.e. the response of the environment
to the external particle, and the other one where back-reaction is considered. The
calculation was performed using the Kadanoﬀ-Baym equation through the Keldysh
formalism. When back-reaction is neglected, the spectral function is equal to the
equilibrium one, which can be represented as a Breit-Wigner distribution. When
back-reaction is introduced we observed a damping in the spectral function of the
thermal bath. Such behavior modiﬁes the damping rate for particles created within
the bath. This certainly implies phenomenological consequences right after the Big-
Bang, when the primordial bath was created.

Introduction

1
The understanding of nonequilibrium phenomena has shown itself to be a very elusive issue
over the years, yet it is crucial to comprehend these type of phenomena as it has mold our
universe as it is. Several mechanisms has been introduced to deal with these issues, for
example in the context of inﬂaton decay, electro-weak baryogenesis, leptogenesis, dark
matter production, and Big-Bang nucleosynthesis among others (for reviews about these
issues see [1, 2]).

Nonequilibrium phenomena are an initial condition problem that can be treated with
the evolution of the density matrix or the evolution of ﬁelds. As a matter of simplicity it is
usually treated as a weakly coupled particle produced in a strongly coupled thermal bath.
This is done to guarantee a power expansion in terms of the coupling constant between
the interacting ﬁelds.

It has been shown that out-of-equilibrium processes there are always two independent
important quantities, namely the spectral function and the statistical propagator, this is
related to the fact that propagators will not only depend on the diﬀerence of time between
two events but also on the “center of mass” time.
In equilibrium, these two quantities
are related via the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relation [3] , or the Fluctuation-Dissipation
Theorem [4, 5] . Conditions which does not apply in an out-of-equilibrium scenario.

The spectral function, as its names shows, have all the information of a (non-)thermal
ﬁeld. In equilibrium, and for small imaginary part of the self-energy, it can be described
as a Breit-Wigner function. This is often called a quasi-particle, whose pole can be deﬁned
as the eﬀective mass of a ﬁeld in a thermal bath, and its width can be interpreted as the
decay parameter which describes the production or annihilation. On the other hand, the
statistical propagator is related to the occupation number of the ﬁelds, which normally
tells us the number of the particles in the bath.

Commonly these two quantities are computed via the semi-classical Boltzmann equation
with quantum corrections inserted in the collision factor. This type of approach lacks of
several important physical aspects when one include phenomena as for example coherent
oscillations, oﬀ-shell corrections or non-Markovian eﬀects. In order to properly approach
these issues, one needs to start with the well known Kadanoﬀ-Baym equations (KBE) [6].
The KBE are diﬀerential-integral equations where the important properties come from the
convolution of full propagators with the self-energy. Although the KBE are hard to work
with and normally they can only be treated numerically, it was shown in [7] that they can
be solved analytically in the leptogenesis scenario. This simple scenario can be used as the
starting point to comprehend the properties of the KBE and their relation to the semi-
classical Boltzmann equation, where already numerous studies has been performed [8–25].
For example, it was shown in [26] that the main diﬀerence between both evolution equations
comes from the fact that there is a time where quantum processes are important, time that
is related to the decay width of the out-of-equilibrium ﬁeld.

In certain nonequilibrium scenarios backreaction can not be easily disregarded since it

2

determines particle emission and absorption within the bath. The study of these eﬀects
can be approached in a methodic way using the results obtained in [7] for a weakly coupled
ﬁeld. Results which can be extended for more complicated scenarios.
In this context,
backreaction can be treated as a 2-loop process, which means that quantum eﬀects can
have a big impact in the spectral function.

In this paper we will focus on a simple scalar model following the deﬁnitions of [27]
with an interaction of the form L ∼ gφχ2, where the ﬁeld φ is the weakly coupled out-of-
equilibrium ﬁeld and χ is a strongly coupled ﬁeld that composes the thermal bath, which
can also be coupled to other ﬁelds in equilibrium. As in [7] and [27], the mass of the φ
ﬁeld is much larger than the mass of the particles in the bath, i.e. mφ (cid:29) mχ. Although,
it can be generalized easily for diﬀerent hierarchy of masses. After performing a suitable
expansion of the KBE in the coupling constant g, one can analytically ﬁnd the proper
propagators of the ﬁelds and ﬁnally study the introduction of backreaction in a consistent
way.

This paper will be constructed as follows, in chapter 2 we will give a brief review on
equilibrium and nonequilibrium formalism for the calculation of the spectral function and
the statistical propagator. In chapter 3 we follow the prescription and show the solution
of these quantities when backreaction is neglected. In chapter 4 we include backreaction
where we calculated the time evolution of the spectral function as it goes out of equilibrium
and thermalizes later. In chapter 6 we discuss the new “sum rule” for the spectral function.
In chapter 7 we give numerical solutions for the nonequilibrium spectral function.

2 Keldysh Formalism for scalar ﬁelds
To understand nonequilibrium phenomena we will ﬁrst give a brief description of the
Keldysh formalism already presented in several articles [28–34]. A ﬁeld Φ is coupled to
a thermal bath described by a self-energy ΠC. The Green’s function ∆C satisﬁes the
Schwinger-Dyson equation

variance.

coordinates and it is convenient to perform a spatial Fourier transformation in x1 − x2.

3 Solution of the spectral function and the statistical

propagator without backreaction

It was shown in [27] that the spectral function will only depend on the time diﬀerence y =
t1 − t2 when backreaction is neglected. That is a direct consequence of time-translational
invariance of the self-energy. Hence, the ﬁrst Kadanoﬀ-Baym equation (2.13) takes the

4 Nonequilibrium spectral function with backreaction
To study backreaction one has to describe the eﬀects that the bath has on itself. Taking
into account that equilibrium propagators will only give equilibrium spectral functions, we
need to include nonequilibrium propagators from the last section in the bath’s self-energy
Σq. This is analogous to a 2-loop expansion in the Kadanoﬀ-Baym equations. The spectral

This equation, as it is normal with nonequilibrium phenomena, will depend on the
initial conditions given by the initial time ti, although it will explicitly disappear. We will
see that because of the condition t1, t2 > ti, the initial conditions will have an eﬀect on the
phase-space when a Fourier transformation is performed on the time diﬀerence |t1 − t2|.

Nonequilibrium self-energy
The self-energy to include in the inhomogeneous solution (4.14) depends explicitly on the
nonequilibrium propagators of φ (the full list of propagators is given in appendix A). One
can ﬁrst see that the propagators can be always written as a sum of an equilibrium term and
a nonequilibrium one, this comes from the fact that the equilibrium condition is already
included in the propagators

∆k(t1, t2) = ∆eq,k(t1 − t2) + ∆non,k(t1, t2) .

This leads to a separation of the self-energy in an equilibrium and nonequilibrium part,
therefore, a separation in the spectral function

Although the integration in the time coordinates appears to be simple, one needs to
be careful with the absolute values in the exponentials. For the case t1 > t2 it is easy to
check that t(cid:48) > t(cid:48)(cid:48).
The integration over time will result on a pole structure of a combination of ωq, ω(cid:48)
q,
ωk and the decay widths Γq, Γ(cid:48)
q and Γk. In the following we will consider the case where
Γq = Γ(cid:48)

are considered. The integration can be performed by changing the sines and cosines to
exponential, which will give a combination of the form

where ˜t = t(cid:48), t(cid:48)(cid:48) and α, β, γ = ±1.
As the same in previous sections, we will focus on the scenario where the mass of the
ﬁeld φ is much larger than the mass of the particles in the bath χ, i.e. M (cid:29) mχ. As
a result the pole structure of the function J after integrating ˜t that will have a bigger

5 Sum rule
One of the most important aspects of the spectral function that arises from the boundary
conditions, called the sum rule, is the fact that the area of the spectral function in the
frequency phase-space (ω) is constant. Meaning that, for example, any change that modiﬁes
the height of the spectral function will lead automatically to a broadness of its width and
vice-versa. We will show how the nonequilibrium corrections does not aﬀect such sum
rule, and it can modify the spectral function without changing its area. Using the border
conditions shown in eqs. (2.15)-(2.17) one can write for any spectral function σ

σ(t1, t2)|t1=t2 = 0 ,
∂t1σ(t1, t2)|t1=t2 = −∂t2σ(t1, t2)|t1=t2 = 1 ,
∂t1∂t2σ(t1, t2)|t1=t2 = 0 .

(5.1)
(5.2)
(5.3)

We can split the spectral function into an equilibrium and nonequilibrium contribution

σ(t1, t2) = σeq(t1 − t2) + σnon(t1, t2) .

(5.4)

Notice the dependence on the diﬀerence of time for the equilibrium spectral function.
One can easily verify that the border conditions is equally satisﬁed for the nonequilibrium
part. This is done by taking the general solution (4.10) or solutions (4.12) and (4.14). The
ﬁrst condition is justiﬁed as the spectral function is antisymmetric. The second condition
can be satisfy by using our solution for the nonequilibrium contribution in eq. (4.10), or
the exact solution for this model given by eq. (4.26).

In order to visualize the physical properties of the border conditions we need to perform
a Fourier transform in the variable y. Although one can naively think as this transform
as going to energy phase-space, we should emphasize that this quantity is not conserved
under the integral in nonequilibrium scenarios, that means that it should not be treated
as the energy of the thermal bath. Now, one can write

σ(y, t) = i

ρ(ω, t)e

−iωy ,

dω
2π

(5.5)

F denotes the appropriate domain of integration and ρ(ω, t) = −iσ(ω, t) is deﬁned
to be a real quantity. Notice that the dependence on ω means the Fourier transform of the
y variable. The ﬁrst boundary condition implies that at y = 0 we have

which shows the antisymmetric property of the spectral function ρ(ω, t) = −ρ(−ω, t). The
second condition must be applied more carefully. For instance, the time t dependance for
an equilibrium spectral function will disappear ρeq(ω, t) → ρeq(ω)1 which gives

dω ωρeq(ω) = 1 .

F

(5.7)

This last equation is usually known as the sum rule of the equilibrium spectral function. It
relates the peak of the spectral function to the decay width associated to the ﬁeld. When
the ﬁeld is out-of-equilibrium one needs to be more careful with the time derivative, this
gives

The dependance on t makes the new term appears. Because of the nature of the Kadanoﬀ-
Baym equation, one can write the ω-dependent spectral function as an equilibrium plus a
nonequilibrium part

Although the last equation appears to violate the antisymmetric property of the spectral

with the nonequilibrium part satisfying eq. (5.13).

(5.14)

6 Disscusion
Equations (4.25) and (4.26) show the oscillatory behavior of the nonequilibrium spectral
function with exponential suppression on the y and t time coordinates. The latter is an
expected behavior for the nonequilibrium part as it should thermalize as time goes to
inﬁnity. Notice that the temperature dependance appears as usual on the Bose-Einstein
distribution function f B(ωk) The thermal eﬀect are relevant when T (cid:38) M/√2. This means
that nonequilibrium eﬀects will only be relevant if the temperature is of the order of the
scale of the system, which in this case the mass of the nonequilibrium ﬁeld.

Figure 4: Nonequilibrium contribution to the spectral function G−
and ωq = 0.5M

non,q(t1, t2) with T = 3M

Remember that the full solution for the spectral function is the sum of the nonequilib-
rium solution with the equilibrium one, so eﬀects will not only depend on the temperature
but also on the square of the coupling. The fact that Γk as shown in eq.
(3.21) also
depends on the square of the coupling implies that nonequilibrium eﬀects can be relevant
since they go as g2/Γk. Equations (4.25) and (4.26) satisﬁes the border conditions in
(2.15)-(2.17) and the sum rule in (5.13), which means that the nonequilibrium eﬀects
can modify the spectral function height but maintaining its area intact. Moreover, these

16

eﬀects can have big repercussion if a second ﬁeld is involved in the system.

The momentum integration must be performed numerically as shown in appendix B.
The three dimensional momentum integration can be carefully calculated with the pro-
jection of the momenta q and k through a mixing angle θ. Although the decay widths
depend on the momentum of each ﬁeld, we will for simplicity consider them as constant.
This can be justiﬁed by looking at the integration window. For example, from the deﬁni-
tion (3.21) one can see that Γk is supported near the pole of the propagator, that is near
the quasi-particle eﬀective mass and can in principle be taken as constant. The result of
the integration can be seen in ﬁg. 4 with the time variables t1 and t2. From ﬁg. 4 one
can observe the asymmetrical behavior of the spectral function, as well as the oscillatory
behavior and exponential suppression in both axes.

Figure 5: Full spectral function G−

non,q(ω, t)

q (ω, t) = G−

eq,q(ω) + G−

Although, as we mentioned before, the initials conditions do not appear explicitly in
the solutions, one needs to have in mind that these solutions are only valid in the range
|y| ≤ 2t, restriction that comes from the fact that we imposed t1, t2 ≥ 0.
A natural way to physically understand the properties of the spectral function, is to
go to frequency space through a Fourier transformation of the y = t1 − t2 coordinate.
In equilibrium, this transformation corresponds to shift to the energy phase space of a
pseudo-particle with its corresponding thermal corrections to the mass. In nonequilibrium
scenarios it is still possible to deﬁne a frequency ω related to y. However, this new variable
ω is not a conserved quantity such as energy in equilibrium. Despite the above, we can
still use this new parameter to describe the thermalization.

Introducing the variable ω as the Fourier transform of y will give the full spectral
function in ﬁg. 5, that is the sum of the equilibrium solution to the nonequilibrium

one. This ﬁgure gives a very good description of the thermalization and back-reaction
It starts as a normal Breit-Wigner at t = 0 and goes

out-of-equilibrium as the φ ﬁeld is been created.
If the coupling or temperature is big
enough, the eﬀect can be substantial. The wiggles observed in the ﬁgure is the way the
nonequilibrium eﬀects satisfy the sum rule discussed above.

Fig. 6 shows a transversal cut of the nonequilibrium contribution for a ﬁxed time
(t = 12/M) for diﬀerent temperatures. As the temperature raises, the eﬀect of the
backreaction increases as well. However, when the temperature is high enough, eﬀects as
thermal masses or corrections to the coupling and width must be taken into account. One
particular point of interest here is the shift of the pole when temperature increases. This
pole shift correction is similar as the one that appears with the inclusion of thermal masses,
it indicates that the eﬃcient energy where the process takes place is not at the mass equilib-
rium pole but it is shifted due to the quantum corrections that need to satisfy the sum rule.

To show how big this new nonequilibrium corrections are with respect to the equilibrium
spectral density at its maximum value, we can focus on diﬀerent values ω as seen in ﬁg. 7.
At ω = 0.47M it exhibits the biggest increment as the temperature increases, conﬁrming a
direct consequence of the pole moving from equilibrium. This shift starts to occur occurs
for T (cid:38) M. For values of T (cid:38) 4M, the correction is signiﬁcant compared to the equilibrium
spectral density and increases linearly with T .

(B.2)
The momemtum q(cid:48) = k − q is just the diﬀerence between the momentum of the eternal
bath momentum and the nonequilibrium ﬁeld φ. So that the integration depends also on
the angle between these two momenta. Making the change of variables for a massless bath
particle (i.e. q(cid:48) = ωq(cid:48) and q = ωq)

(cid:48)

q

= |k − q| = (k2 + q2 − 2k · q cos θ)1/2,

one obtains the following diﬀerential for q(cid:48)

The limits for the k integration can be obtained from ωp = ωk − q − q(cid:48) with the limits for
q(cid:48), then one obtains k2 + M 2 < (k + 2q)2, giving ﬁnally
