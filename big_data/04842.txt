ABSTRACT
In this manuscript, the authors consider a sub-class of the
two-dimensional homogeneous nearest neighbor (simple) ran-
dom walk restricted on the lattice. In particular, the sub-
class of random walks with equilibrium distributions given
as series of product-forms is considered and the derivations
for the calculations of the terms involved in the equilibrium
distribution representation, as well as the eigenvalues and
the corresponding eigenvectors of the matrix R are pre-
sented. The above results are obtained by connecting three
existing approaches available for such an analysis: the ma-
trix geometric approach, the compensation approach and
the boundary value problem method.

INTRODUCTION

The objective of this work is to demonstrate how to obtain
the equilibrium distribution of the state of a two-dimensional
homogeneous nearest neighbor (simple) random walk re-
stricted on the lattice using the matrix geometric approach.
This type of random walk can be modeled as a Quasi-Birth-
Death (QBD) process with the characteristic that both the
levels and the phases are countably inﬁnite. Then, based on
the matrix geometric approach, if πn = (πn,0 πn,1
··· )
denotes the vector of the equilibrium distribution at level n,
n = 0, 1, . . ., it is known that πn+1 = πnR. This is a very
well known result, but the complexity of the solution lies in
the calculation of the inﬁnite dimension matrix R. In this
manuscript, the authors develop a new methodological ap-
proach for the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
of matrix R. Moreover, this approach can be numerically
used for the approximation of the matrix R.

As a ﬁrst step and for illustration purposes, as well as for rea-
sons of simplicity, we restrict our analysis to random walks
whose equilibrium distribution away from the origin (0, 0)
can be written as a series (ﬁnite or inﬁnite) of product-

tions, referred to as conditions for meromorphicity, cf.
[1,
4],

• Step size: Only transitions to neighboring states are

allowed;

• Forbidden steps: No transitions from interior states to

the North, North-East, and East are allowed;

• Homogeneity: All transitions in the same direction oc-

cur according to the same rate;

the equilibrium distribution of the simple random walk re-
stricted on the lattice can be written as a series of product-
forms for all states n, m > 0, say

πn,m =

∞(cid:88)k=0

˜ck ˜αn
k

˜βm
k , n, m > 0,

(1)

cf.
[1]. Note that the above conditions do not necessarily
imply that the transitions on the boundaries are identical to
the transitions in the interior, thus we allow for π0,m and
πn,0 to exhibit a slightly diﬀerent structural pattern, i.e.

πn,0 =

˜ek ˜αn

k , n > 0,

π0,m =

˜dk ˜βm

k , m > 0,

∞(cid:88)k=0
∞(cid:88)k=0

while π0,0 can be obtained as a function of (1)-(3) by solving
the system of equilibrium equations at the origin.
Some examples of queueing systems that satisfy the above
conditions are the 2 × 2 switch and the join the shortest
queue, see e.g., [2]. Also, we would like to remark that the
conditions for meromorphicity are not necessary for a ran-
dom walk to have an equilibrium distribution in the form of
a series of product-forms, e.g. two-node Jackson networks
although violate the above conditions have equilibrium dis-
tributions with a product-form representation.
In this manuscript, the authors illustrate the connection be-
tween the form of the equilibrium distribution depicted in
Equation (1) and the derivation of the eigenvalues and eigen-
vectors of the inﬁnite matrix R. Moreover, this work sets

3.1.1
Stability condition
Let A = A−1 + A0 + A1 and x be the unique solution to

xA = 0

such that x1 = 1, with 1 a column vector of ones. For the
random walk at hand x corresponds to the vector of the
equilibrium distribution of a Birth-Death process with birth
rates λ0 = q−1,1 + q0,1 + q1,1, λn = q−1,1, n ≥ 1, and death
rates µn = q−1,−1 +q0,−1 +q1,−1, n ≥ 1. Then, it was shown
in Theorem 1.7.1 [13] that the QBD is positive recurrent if
and only if

xA−11 < xA11.

Structure of the QBD solution

3.1.2
Let πn,m, n, m ≥ 0 denote the equilibrium distribution
of the QBD. Then, if πn = (πn,0 πn,1
··· ) denotes the
equilibrium vector of level n, n = 0, 1, . . ., it is known that

πn+1 = πnR,

where the inﬁnite dimensional matrix R is obtained as the
minimal non-negative solution to the matrix quadratic equa-
tion

A1 + RA0 + R2A−1 = 0,

cf. [13]. Solving this last equation in terms of R we obtain
recursively the equilibrium vector πn+1, n ≥ 0, in terms of
the matrix R and the vector of the equilibrium distribution

the groundwork for the probabilistic interpretation of the
terms α and β appearing in the series of product-forms.
The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 the model is
described and in Section 3 the three relevant methods are
sketched; more concretely, the matrix geometric approach
is presented in Section 3.1, the compensation approach in
Section 3.2 and the boundary value problem method in Sec-
tion 3.3. In Section 4 the derivations for the calculations of
the terms involved in the equilibrium distribution represen-
tation are presented and in Section 4.1 the eigenvalues and
the eigenvectors of matrix R are derived. Finally, in Section
5 conclusions and future work is discussed.

2. MODEL DESCRIPTION

To investigate the scope of applicability of the method
described in this manuscript we study a class of Markov
processes on the lattice in the positive quadrant of R2. We
consider random walks (processes) for which the transition
rates are constant, i.e. do not depend on the state, and we
further assume that transitions are restricted to neighboring
states. The transition rates are depicted in Figure 1.

However, the structure of the ran-
dom walk is overly generic and thus does not permit the
calculation of the inﬁnite matrix R. This will be achieved
by combining the two other approaches used in the analysis
of random walks on the lattice: the compensation approach
and the boundary value problem method.
3.2 Compensation approach

The compensation approach is developed by Adan et al.
in a series of papers [1, 2, 3] and aims at a direct solu-
tion for the sub-class of two-dimensional random walks on
the lattice of the ﬁrst quadrant that obey the conditions for
meromorphicity. The compensation approach can also be
eﬀectively used in cases that the random walk at hand does
not satisfy the aforementioned conditions, but the equilib-
rium distribution still can be written in the form of series
of product-forms. This is due to the fact that this approach
exploits the structure of the equilibrium equations in the in-
terior of the quarter plane by imposing that linear (ﬁnite or
inﬁnite) combinations of product-forms satisfy them. This
leads to a kernel equation for the terms appearing in the
product-forms. Then, it is required that these linear combi-
nations satisfy the equilibrium equations on the boundaries
as well. As it turns out, this can be done by alternatingly
compensating for the errors on the two boundaries, which
eventually leads to a (potentially) inﬁnite series of product-
forms.
For the model described in Section 2 one can easily show,
cf. [1], that
Step 1: πn,m = ˜αn ˜βm, m, n > 0, is a solution to the equi-
librium equations in the interior if and only if ˜α and ˜β
satisfy

Step 2: Consider a product-form c0 ˜αn
0

(5)

˜α ˜β(q−1,1 + q1,−1 + q0,−1 + q−1,−1 + q−1,0)
= ˜α2q−1,1 + ˜β2q1,−1 + ˜α ˜β2q0,−1
+ ˜α2 ˜β2q−1,−1 + ˜α2 ˜βq−1,0.
˜βm
0 that satisﬁes the
kernel equation (5) and also satisﬁes the equilibrium
equations of the horizontal boundary. Without loss of
generality we can assume that c0 = 1. If the product-
˜βm
form c0 ˜αn
0 also satisﬁes the equilibrium equations
0
of the vertical boundary then this constitutes the solu-
tion of the equilibrium equations up to a multiplicative
constant that can be obtained using the normalizing
equation. Otherwise, consider a linear combination of
˜βm
two product-forms, say ˜αn
1 , m, n > 0,
0
such that this combination satisﬁes now the equilib-
rium equations of the vertical boundary. For this to
happen it must be that ˜β1 = ˜β0 and that ˜α1 satisﬁes
the kernel equation (5) for ˜β = ˜β0.

˜βm
0 + c1 ˜αn
1

Step 3: Finally, as long as our expression of linear combi-
nations of product-forms violates one of the two equi-
librium equations on the boundary, we continue by
adding new product-form terms satisfying the kernel
equation (5). This will eventually lead to Equation
(1). Of course, one still needs to show that the series
expression of Equation (1) converges for all n, m > 0.

3.3 Boundary value problem method

The boundary value problem method is an analytic method
which is applicable to some two-dimensional random walks

restricted to the ﬁrst quadrant. The bivariate probability
generating function (PGF), say

Π(x, y) =

∞(cid:88)n=0

∞(cid:88)m=0

πn,mxnym, |x|,|y| ≤ 1,

of the position of a homogeneous nearest neighbor random
walk satisﬁes a functional equation of the form

K(x, y)Π(x, y) + A(x, y)Π(x, 0) + B(x, y)Π(0, y)

+ C(x, y)Π(0, 0) = 0,

(6)

with K(x, y), A(x, y), B(x, y) and C(x, y) known bivariate
polynomials in x and y, depending only on the parameters
of the random walk. In particular,

K(x, y) = y2q−1,1 + x2q1,−1 + xq0,−1

+ q−1,−1 + yq−1,0
− xy(q−1,1 + q1,−1 + q0,−1 + q−1,−1 + q−1,0)

and hence K(1/ ˜α, 1/ ˜β) = 0 reduces to exactly Equation (5).

The boundary value problem method consists of the fol-

lowing steps:

i) First, deﬁne the zero tuples (x, y) such that K(x, y) =

0, |x|,|y| < 1.

ii) Then, along the curve K(x, y) = 0 (and provided that

Π(x, y) is deﬁned on this curve), Equation (6) reads

A(x, y)Π(x, 0) + B(x, y)Π(0, y)

+ C(x, y)Π(0, 0) = 0.

(7)

iii) Finally, in same instances Equation (7) can be solved

as a Riemann (Hilbert) boundary value problem.

Malyshev pioneered this approach of transforming the func-
tional equation to a boundary value problem in the 1970’s.
The idea to reduce the functional equation for the generat-
ing function to a standard Riemann-Hilbert boundary value
problem stems from the work of Fayolle and Iasnogorodski
[7] on two parallel M/M/1 queues with coupled processors
(the service speed of a server depends on whether or not the
other server is busy). Extensive treatments of the boundary
value technique for functional equations can be found in Co-
hen and Boxma [6, Part II] and Fayolle, Iasnogorodski and
Malyshev [8]. The model depicted in Figure 1 can be ana-
lyzed by the approach developed by Fayolle and Iasnogorod-
ski [7, 8] and Cohen and Boxma [6], however this approach
does not lead to the direct determination of the equilibrium
distribution, since it requires inverting the PGF, and the ex-
isting numerical approaches for this method are oftentimes
tedious and case speciﬁc.

4. ANALYSIS

In this paper, we connect for the ﬁrst time the three ap-
proaches: the matrix geometric approach, the compensation
approach and the boundary value problem method. We will
demonstrate now how to easily compute recursively these
˜α’s and ˜β’s.

Figure 2: The recursive structure of the product-form terms.

··· )T .
(8)
In the last equation the term (x−1I − R)−1 should be
interpreted as an operator instead of the inverse of a
matrix. Then, Equation (6) reduces to
π1 (x−1I − R)−1(cid:16)K(x, y)( 1 y
+ A(x, y)( 1 0 0 ··· )T(cid:17)
= − π0(cid:16) (K(x, y) + B(x, y)) ( 1 y
··· )T
+ (A(x, y) + C(x, y)) ( 1 0 0 ··· )T(cid:17).

Note that due to (1) we can meromorphically continue
the PGF on the entire complex domain, i.e. the PGF
is holomorphic on the entire complex domain except
for a set of isolated points (the poles of the function)
x−1 = ˜αk and y−1 = ˜βk, k ≥ 0. More concretely, it can
be shown that these PGFs are meromorphic functions,
i.e., they have a ﬁnite number of poles in every ﬁnite
domain, cf. [5].

(9)

y2

Step 2: For the isolated point x−1 = ˜α0 the right hand side

of (9) is well deﬁned, which implies that

K(x, y)( 1 y
+ A(x, y)( 1 0 0 ··· )T = 0,

··· )T

y2

or equivalently that K(x, y) = 0 and A(x, y) = 0.
This reveals the starting solution ˜α0, with | ˜α0| < 1
for the iterative calculation of the sequences { ˜αk}k≥0
and { ˜βk}k≥0.
For the starting solution x−1 = ˜α0 we calculate recur-
sively y−1 = ˜β0 by the kernel equation K(x, y) = 0.
This will produce a single ˜β with | ˜β| ≤ | ˜α|. We can

proceed in an analogous manner and construct the en-
tire set of product-form terms. Moreover, one can eas-
ily show, cf. [1], that

˜β2k+1 = ˜β2k, k ≥ 0

and ˜α2k+1, k ≥ 0, is obtained as the root of

K(1/ ˜α2k+1, 1/ ˜β2k+1) = 0

with | ˜α2k+1| < | ˜β2k+1|. Also,

˜α2k = ˜α2k−1, k ≥ 1,

and ˜β2k , k ≥ 1, is obtained as the root of

K(1/ ˜α2k, 1/ ˜β2k) = 0

with | ˜β2k| < | ˜α2k|. Figure 2 displays the way in which
the product-form terms are generated.

Step 3: We now consider a new representation of πn,m so
as to avoid repetitions in the family of roots of the
kernel. To this purpose, for k ≥ 0 we denote:

αk = ˜α2k,

βk = ˜β2k.

Then, Equations (1), (2) and (3) are re-written, for
n, m > 0

πn,m = c0αn

ck = ˜c2k−1, fk = ˜c2k/˜c2k−1, ek = ˜e2k + ˜e2k−1 and
dk = ˜d2k + ˜d2k−1. Equivalently, we can also consider
the following representation, for n, m > 0,

πn,m =

k+1),

(12)

∞(cid:88)k=0

with c∗0 = c0, c∗k = ckfk for k > 0 and f∗k+1 = ck+1/c∗k.
Now we have the sequence of the zero-tuples of the
kernel equation, cf. Figure 3, with ’forward’ oper-
ators y+ and x+ and ’backward’ operators y− and

quadratic function in either y or x

K(x, y) = ax(y − y+(x))(y − y−(x)),
K(x, y) = ˜ay(x − x+(y))(x − x−(y))

for some functions ax and ˜ay, yields

Step 4: It remains to show how to calculate the coeﬃcients
of the product-form terms. Observe that the represen-
tations (10)-(11) for the πn,m (or equivalently (12)-
(11)) yield

We ﬁrst identify the sequences {ek}k≥0 and {dk}k≥0
appearing in (11). Next, we set y = y+(x) in (9) (for
which K(x, y+(x)) = 0) and substitute the representa-
tions for Π(x, 0) and Π(0, y). We multiply the resulting
equation with 1 − αix and take the limit as x → 1/αi.
This yields

Similarly, we could have chosen x = x±(y), but the
resulting equations would be identical to the ones de-
rived above.
Now starting from e0 all the coeﬃcients {ek}k≥0 and
{dk}k≥0 are obtained recursively as follows: for a given
ek using Equation (18) one can derive dk, next Equa-
tion (19) produces ek+1.

Step 5: Having {ek}k≥0 and {dk}k≥0 recursively identiﬁed
in terms of e0, we show in this paragraph how to ob-
tain the sequence {ck}k≥0. Multiplying Equation (9)

with 1 − αix, then substituting (15)-(17) therein, and
afterwards taking the limit as x → 1/αi and setting
y = 1 gives

Now using (22), multiplying Equation (9) by 1 − βiy,
and afterwards taking the limit as y → 1/βi and set-

for i ≥ 1. Now the iterative procedure is as follows:
Starting from c0, we derive e0 from Equation (20) (and
hence from Step 4 all coeﬃcients {ek}k≥0 and {dk}k≥0
are produced in terms of c0). Then, from Equation
(24) we calculate c1. Having c1 and using (21) we
identify f1, which allows us to derive c2 from Equa-
tion (25). Continuing this procedure permits the iden-
tiﬁcation of the sequences {ck}k≥0 and {fk}k≥1. The
starting constant c0 is uniquely identiﬁed by the nor-
malization equation.
Note that from the construction of Equation (6) it fol-
lows that we can take any |y| ≤ 1 instead of y = 1
(respectively any |x| ≤ 1) since the rhs of the above
equation does not in practice depend on y.

4.1 The matrix R

We are now in position to present the main result of the
manuscript, that connects the derivation of the matrix R
with Equations (10) and (11), and hence the boundary value
problem with the matrix geometric approach.

Theorem 1. The terms {αk}k≥0 constitute the diﬀerent
eigenvalues of the matrix R. For eigenvalue αk the corre-
sponding eigenvector of the matrix R is hk = (hk,0, hk,1, kk,2 . . .),
with hk,0 = ek and hk,m = ck(βm
if and only if ck (cid:54)= 0.

k ) (m = 1, 2, . . .),

k−1 + fkβm

Proof. From (10) and (11) note that, for n > 0,

πn = (πn,0 πn,1 πn,2

=

∞(cid:88)k=0

k hk.

··· )

Plugging this last result into (4) and after straightforward
manipulations yields

∞(cid:88)k=0

αn
k hk(αkI − R) = 0, ∀n > 0.

From this last equation it is needed that
hk(αkI − R) = 0, ∀k ≥ 0,

which implies the statement of the Theorem, cf. [11].

Remark 1. Note that one could use in the above proof the
representations of Equations (1) and (2), instead of (10)
and (11). Such a choice, would reveal that the sequence
{ ˜αk}k≥0 constitutes the eigenvalues of matrix R, with eigen-
values ˜αk, k ≥ 1, having an algebraic multiplicity of 2, since
˜α2k = ˜α2k−1, k ≥ 1, and geometric multiplicity equal to 2,
since for eigenvalue ˜α2k there are two eigenvectors

··· )

which if added together and taking into account the connec-
tions between the various representations produce exactly the
eigenvector hk, k ≥ 1, appearing in Theorem 1.
4.1.1 Numerical evaluation of matrix R
It is known, see [1, 4], that the sequences {αk}k≥0 and
{βk}k≥0 decrease exponentially fast to 0. Based on this
fact, we suggest to truncate the dimension of the matrix R,
say at phase N , and obtain its approximation, say RN , as

RN = H−1

N DN HN ,

1 , . . . hN

N ), where hN

with DN = diag(α0, α1, . . . , αN ) and the matrix HN =
(hN
k = (hk,0, . . . , hk,N ). Then, as N →
∞ the matrix RN = HN DN H−1
N converges to the inﬁ-
nite matrix R, cf. [11]. Furthermore, closely inspecting the
structure of the matrix HN = (hk,m)0≤k,m≤N we observe
that it can be written as a generalized Vandermonde matrix
for which the inverse can be easily calculated.

5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this manuscript, the authors present a methodological
approach that on the one hand permits a straightforward
derivation of the equilibrium distribution of random walks
in the quadrant satisfying the conditions for meromorphicity

and on the other hand connects three existing techniques:
the matrix geometric approach, the compensation approach,
and the boundary value problem method. Furthermore, the
derivation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix R
sets the groundwork for the probabilistic interpretation of
the terms α and β appearing in the expression of the equi-
librium distribution. This work can be easily extended to
cover a wider spectrum of random walks with meromorphic
probability generating functions.
