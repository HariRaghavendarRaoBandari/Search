ON A GENERALIZATION OF BOURGAIN’S TREE INDEX

KEVIN BEANLAND AND RYAN M. CAUSEY

Abstract. For a Banach space X, a sequence of Banach spaces (Yn), and a Banach space
Z with an unconditional basis, D. Alspach and B. Sari introduced a generalization of a
Bourgain tree called a (⊕nYn)Z -tree in X. These authors also prove that any separable
Banach space admitting a (⊕nYn)Z-tree with order ω1 admits a subspace isomorphic to
(⊕nYn)Z . In this paper we give two new proofs of this result.

1. Introduction

In a recent work [1], D. Alspach and B. Sari prove that every separable, elastic Banach
space isomorphically contains C[0, 1], and is therefore universal for the class of separable
Banach spaces. This remarkable result answers a question from an earlier deep work of
W.B. Johnson and E. Odell [8], in which they introduced the notion of elastic Banach space
and use Bourgain’s ℓ∞-tree index [6] to show that separable, elastic spaces isomorphically
contain c0. A critical step in Alspach and Sari’s proof is to introduce the concept of a
(⊕nYn)Z-tree in X and the corresponding (⊕nYn)Z-index, which generalizes Bourgain’s tree
index. We ﬁrst recall the deﬁnition of a Bourgain tree, ﬁrst given in [6]. Given a sequence
(yi) having dense span in some Banach space Y (usually a basis for Y ), a Banach space X,
and a positive constant D, we let

T (X, D, (yi)) = (cid:8)(xi)n

Here, F denotes the scalar ﬁeld. It is easy to see that Y D-embeds into X if and only if
there exists an inﬁnite sequence (xi)∞
i=1 ∈ T (X, D, (yi)).
We consider the following generalization.

space with 1-unconditional basis (zn), and YZ denote the unconditional sum (⊕nYn)Z. For

that

We say a subset T of T (C, D, X) is a (⊕nYn)Z-tree in X with constants C, D if for any
(Ai)n

i=1 ∈ T and each 1 6 m 6 n, (Ai)m

i=1 ∈ T .

Given a collection T of ﬁnite sequences, we say T is a tree provided that any initial
segment of a member of T is also a member of T . A subset S of T is a subtree if it is also
a tree. Then T is a (⊕nYn)Z-tree in X with constants C, D if and only if it is a subtree
of T (C, D, X). We note that the deﬁnition given above is not the one given by Alspach
and Sari. They considered subtrees of the tree S(C, D, X) consisting of all ﬁnite sequences
(Xi, Bi)n
i=1 such that Xi is a closed subspace of X, Bi : Xi → Yi is an isomorphism, and
(B−1
i=1 ∈ T (C, D, X). Note that the one-to-one correspondence between the sequences
in T (C, D, X) and the sequences of S(C, D, X) given by (Ai)n
i=1 also
identiﬁes subtrees of T (C, D, X) with subtrees of S(C, D, X). Thus, for our purposes, it is
suﬃcient to consider T (C, D, X).

In [1], the following generalization of a classical result for Bourgain trees is proved.

Theorem 1.2. [1, Theorem 14] Suppose X is separable, (Yn) is a sequence of separable
Banach spaces, and Z is a Banach space with a 1-unconditional basis. Then for D > 1, if
there exists C > 0 such that there exists a (⊕nYn)Z-tree with order ω1 in X with constants
C, D, X has a subspace D-isomorphic to YZ .

The main contribution of this note is to give two diﬀerent proofs of the above result which
might be considered more conceptual than the one found in [1]. Indeed, both proofs are
straightforward applications of some of the descriptive set theoreitc machinery we present.
The ﬁrst proof uses a well-known result concerning trees satisfying a certain topological
condition such that the members of the tree are sequences in a Polish space. Prior to this
work, the main obstruction towards using these results is the lack of an obvious Polish topol-
ogy on collections of operators with varying domains. We feel that this proof is interesting
because it is a new application of a recently introduced coding of operators between sepa-
rable Banach spaces. The second proof, on the other hand, is perhaps even simpler as it
uses a pre-existing ordinal index on X. The second proof does not require the coding of
operators, but instead follows from considering the relationship between the tree T (C, D, X)
and the tree T (X, D, (yi)) given above, for an auspiciously chosen sequence (yi). We begin
with some deﬁnitions and preliminaries in the next section. In particular we recall the topol-
ogy on the set of operators between separable Banach spaces and some well-known facts on
Polish spaces and trees. The subsequent sections contain the proofs advertised above.

2. Preliminaries

Recall the deﬁnition of tree and subtree given in the introduction. To avoid unnecessary
technicalities, we do not deﬁne the order of a tree, but rather indicate the two properties
of the order of a tree that we will need. Given a tree T , the order of T , denoted o(T ), is
either a countable ordinal or the ﬁrst uncountable ordinal. Moreover, the order of a subtree
of T cannot exceed the order of the entire tree T . If S, T are any trees and if f : S → T is
any function that takes proper extensions to proper extensions (recall that the members of
S and T are ﬁnite sequences), then o(S) 6 o(T ).

If Λ is a topological space, we say a tree T on Λ is closed if for each n ∈ N, T ∩ Λn is
closed in Λn with its product topology. A separable, completely metrizable topological space
is called a Polish space. For these spaces we have the following well-known theorem.

Theorem 2.1. [2] Let T be a closed tree on a Polish space P . Then T is well-founded if
and only if o(T ) < ω1.

Given a Polish space P , we let F (P ) denote the closed subsets of P . It is a classical result
of descriptive set theory that there exists a Polish topology on F (P ) [9, page 75]. Another
classical result is that there exists a sequence dn : F (P ) \ {∅} → P of Borel functions (called
Borel selectors) such that for every F ∈ F (P ) \ {∅}, {dn(F ) : n ∈ N} is a dense subset of
F [10]. Fix a Polish topology on F (C(2N)) and a sequence of Borel selectors (dn) as above,
where C(2N) denotes continuous functions on the Cantor set. As is now standard convention,
we let SB denote all elements of F (C(2N)) that are linear subspaces of C(2N). The space
SB is Borel in F (C(2N)) [7, page 9] with respect to our ﬁxed topology on F (C(2N)), and
consequently there exists a Polish topology τ on SB stronger than the topology inherited
as a subspace of F (C(2N)) [9, page 75]. Therefore the functions (dn) are also Borel on SB.
The space SB is the coding of all separable Banach spaces and has been extensively studied
in many contexts [5, 7].

We now endow SB with a stronger Polish topology in the following way. Using [9, page
82], we note that there is Polish topology τ ′ on F (C(2N)) \ {∅} stronger than the topology
τ such that each dn is continuous with respect to τ ′. In the sequel, the topology on SB will
always be τ ′, such that each Borel selector dn is continuous.

2.1. The Polish Space L. As was explained in the introduction, one novelty of the current
work is to isolate the proper Polish space on which to represent the (⊕nYn)Z-trees. To
do so, we recall a coding of the class of operators between separable Banach spaces ﬁrst
given in [4]. First note that SB × SB × C(2N)N is a Polish space when endowed with the
product topology, where C(2N) is endowed with its norm topology. Let L consist of all triples
(X, Y, ˆA) = (X, Y, ( ˆA(n))n) ∈ SB × SB × C(2N)N such that for all n ∈ N, ˆA(n) ∈ Y , and
such that there exists k ∈ N such that for each rational linear combination Pp
i=1 qidni(X) of
(dn(X)), we have kPp
i=1 qidni(X)k. In [3] it is proved that L is a Borel
subset of SB × SB × C(2N)N, so that another appeal to [9] yields the existence of a Polish

i=1 qi ˆA(ni)k 6 kkPp

4

topology on L stronger than the subspace topology it inherits from the product topology on
SB × SB × C(2N)N. In the sequel, L will always be endowed with this Polish topology. Note
that for each n ∈ N, (X, Y, ˆA) 7→ dn(X) is continuous with respect to this topology. The
purpose of this set is to act as a coding of all operators between separable Banach spaces.
To that end, for X, Y ∈ SB and a bounded linear operator A : X → Y , we have the unique
tuple (X, Y, ˆA) ∈ L where ˆA(n) := Adn(X) for each n ∈ N; that is, ˆA : N → C(2N) is deﬁned
as the image of the sequence (dn(X)) ⊂ X under A. Conversely, to each tuple (X, Y, ˆA)
we deﬁne the bounded linear operator A : X → Y by ﬁrst deﬁning A on the dense subset
{dn(X) : n ∈ N} of X by Adn(X) := ˆA(n) and extending linearly and uniquely to all of
X. It is proved in [3, Claim 8.4] that the map dn(X) 7→ ˆA(n) is well-deﬁned and extends
uniquely to a bounded, linear operator deﬁned on all of X.

3. Trees on L: The first proof

Let T be a (⊕nYn)Z-tree in X with constants C, D having order ω1. Then T (C, D, X)
must have order ω1 as well, since it has a subtree with order ω1. In order to prove Theorem
1.2, it suﬃces to show that T (C, D, X) is ill-founded. This will yield an inﬁnite sequence
(Ai)∞
i=1 all of whose ﬁnite initial segments lie in T (C, D, X). Then the operator A : YZ → X
given by AP yi = P Aiyi is easily seen to be a well-deﬁned D-isomorphic embedding of Y
into X.

Our method is to identify T (C, D, X) with a closed tree T (C, D, X) on the Polish space L
in a way that also identiﬁes subtrees of T (C, D, X) with subtrees of T (C, D, X) having the
same order, and that identiﬁes well- (resp.
ill-)founded
trees. Before deﬁning T (C, D, X), we will suppose we have such an identiﬁcation and ﬁnish
the proof. Since the order of T (C, D, X) is uncountable, so is the order of T (C, D, X). Since
T (C, D, X) is a closed tree on a Polish space, it is ill-founded by Theorem 2.1. Therefore
T (C, D, X) is ill-founded as well.

ill-)founded trees with well-(resp.

We proceed then to deﬁne the tree T (C, D, X) on L, establish the identiﬁcation mentioned
above, and show that T (C, D, X) is closed. By embedding X and YZ isometrically into
C(2N), we can assume X, YZ ∈ SB and identify Yi with a subspace of YZ in the natural way,
so that Yi ∈ SB.

Let T (C, D, X) consist of those sequences (Wi, Zi, ˆAi)n

i=1 ∈ L<N such that

(i) for each 1 6 i 6 n, Wi = Yi,
(ii) for each 1 6 i 6 n, Zi = X,
(iii) for each t ∈ N and 1 6 i 6 n, kdt(Yi)k 6 k ˆAi(t)k 6 Ckdt(Yi)k,

The identiﬁcation between T (C, D, X) and T (C, D, X) is given by (Ai)n

i=1.
It is straightforward to check that (Ai)n
i=1 ∈
T (C, D, X).
It is also clear that this identiﬁcation identiﬁes subtrees with subtrees and
preserves well- or ill-foundedness. Note that this identiﬁcation and its inverse maps proper
extensions to proper extensions and so, by the remarks in the preliminaries, it preserves
orders.

i=1 ∈ T (C, D, X) if and only if (Yi, X, ˆAi)n

i=1 ↔ (Yi, X, ˆAi)n

We will prove that T (C, D, X) is a closed tree. For completeness we have included the
details of the routine argument. Fix n ∈ N. We show that if ((W j
j=1 ⊂
T (C, D, X) converges in L to (Wi, Zi, ˆAi)n
i=1, then (Wi, Zi, ˆAi)n
i=1 ∈ T (C, D, X). By def-
inition of T (C, D, X), W j
i = Yi and Z j
i = X for each 1 6 i 6 n and j ∈ N. By
continuity of the coordinate projections (X ′, Y ′, A′) 7→ X ′, Y ′ on L, for each 1 6 i 6 n,
Wi = limj W j
i = limj X = X. This shows that (i) and (ii)
are satisﬁed, and the limit (Wi, Zi, ˆAi)n

conditions (i)-(iv), and T (C, D, X) is closed.

i (ti) → ˆAi(ti), we deduce that the same pair of
i=1 satisﬁes

Remark 3.1. The reason we consider inverses of the original trees of Alspach and Sari is
that, when the Borel selectors are continuous, the limit of a sequence of uniformly bounded
isomorphisms with uniformly bounded inverses must be an isomorphic embedding with the
same bounds on the norm and the norm of the inverse. However, by considering a sequence of
norm-one linear functionals converging weak* to zero, we can see that the limit of surjections
need not be a surjection.

4. An alternative approach

Fix a separable Banach space Y and (yi) ⊂ Y a sequence with dense span in Y . Given a

separable Banach space X and D > 1, as in the introduction, we may deﬁne the tree

T (X, D, (yi)) = n(xi)n

This is clearly a closed tree. Therefore if X is separable, it follows that T (X, D, (yi)) is well-
founded if and only if o(T (X, D, (yi))) < ω1. It is also easy to see that Y fails to D-embed into
X if and only if o(T (X, D, (yi))) < ω1. Indeed, by Theorem 2.1, o(T (X, D, (yi))) = ω1 if and

only if there exists a sequence (xi)∞
But an inﬁnite sequence (xi)∞
i=1 ⊂ X has all of its ﬁnite initial segments in T (X, D, (yi)) if
and only if it is the image of the sequence (yi) under an isomorphic embedding of Y into X
having norm at most 1 the inverse of which has norm at most D.

Suppose Y = YZ. For each n ∈ N, let Sn = (yn

i ) ⊂ Yn \ {0} be a sequence dense in Yn
(where, as usual, we consider Yn as a subspace of Y ). Let (yi) be some enumeration of ∪nSn
such that for each k, (yi)k
i=1Yi. Note that the span of (yi) is dense in YZ. In light
of the previous paragraph, the Theorem 1.2 is an immediate consequence of the following
claim.

i=1 ⊂ ∪k

Claim 4.1. Let X be a separable Banach space. If there exists a (⊕nYn)Z-tree in X with
constants C, D having uncountable order, then o(T (X, D, (yi))) = ω1, whence YZ D-embeds
into X.

Proof. Let T be an (⊕nYn)Z tree in X with constants C, D having order ω1. As remarked
in the preliminary section, it suﬃces to deﬁne a map f : T → T (X, D, (yi)) such that if
s, t ∈ T and t is an proper extension of s, f (t) is a proper extension of f (s). From this it
will follow that ω1 = o(T ) 6 o(T (X, D, (yi))). Fix t = (Ai)n
i=1 ∈ T . Choose i1, . . . , in such
that for each 1 6 j 6 n, yj ∈ Yij . Note that for each j, ij is unique, since yj 6= 0. Since
(yi)n
i=1 ⊂ ∪n
j=1. By the properties of
(Ai)n
i=1, f (t) ∈ T (X, D, (yi)). Since each ij is unique, if 1 6 m 6 n and if s is the initial
segment of t having length m, f (s) = (Aij yj)m
j=1. Therefore f maps proper extensions to
proper extensions.
