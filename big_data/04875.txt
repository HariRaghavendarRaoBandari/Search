Abstract Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC) is a type of gaseous detector having excel-
lent time and position resolutions. VECC is involved in the R&D of indigenously
developed bakelite RPCs. The largest size of bakelite RPC developed in India is
100cm X 100cm. We present here the test results of a bakelite sample along with
the cosmic ray test results of a bakelite RPC (30cm X 30cm X 0.2cm) fabricated at
VECC. The steps taken towards the development of a large size (240cm X 120cm
X 0.2cm) bakelite RPC have also been discussed.

1 Introduction

Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC) is a gas ﬁlled detector which utilises a constant and
uniform electric ﬁeld produced between two high resistive parallel electrode plates
e.g. glass, bakelite. Several high energy experiments like ALICE, CMS, ATLAS,
BELLE use RPCs. RPCs can be used both for timing and trigerring purposes. RPCs
will be used as active detectors in the proposed Iron CALorimeter (ICAL) exper-
iment in India based Neutrino Observatory (INO) project [1],[2] and in the Near
Detector (ND) of Deep Underground Neutrino Experiemnt(DUNE). ICAL will be a
mammoth 50kTonnes of magnetised iron plates of dimension 48m X 16m X 0.05m
stacked one over another. RPCs of dimension ∼(2m X 2m X 0.002m) will be in-
serted in between two iron plates. There will be ∼150 such layers of iron plates.

2 Fabrication of 30cm X 30cm X 0.2cm bakelite RPC

Authors Suppressed Due to Excessive Length

We have fabricated [3] a single gap 30cm X 30cm X 0.2cm bakelite RPC from 0.3cm
thick bakelite electrode. The bakelite sheets were procured from local market. A gap
of 0.2 cm was maintained between these electrodes with the help of 4 button spacers,
each of diameter 1 cm and height 0.2 cm and 4 side spacers of length 28 cm and
height 0.2 cm along with two gas nozzles. The outer surfaces of both the electrodes
were painted with conducting black graphite paint mixed with special thinner in 1:1
ratio in order to apply uniform electric ﬁeld across the plates. Figure. 1 shows the
different components of the fabricated RPC.

3 Results

3.1 Electrical properties of bakelite sample

The electrical properties like bulk resistivity and surface resistivity of the bakelite
sample were measured and shown in ﬁgure 2. The bulk resistivity of the bakelite
sample was measured to be ∼9X1011Ωcm whereas the surface resistivity was mea-
sured to be ∼3X1012Ω/(cid:3).

3.2 I-V characteristics and current stability of RPC

The I-V characteristics of the fabricated bakelite RPC has been studied in streamer
mode of operation with a gas composition of Argon:Freon(R134a):Iso-butane::55:40:5
as shown in ﬁgure 3(a). Two distinct slopes in the I-V characteristics have been ob-
tained with a breakdown voltage ∼7000V. The RPC has been tested for current
stability for ∼50hrs at ±6000V as shown in ﬁgure-3(b).

Fig. 3 Fig. 3(a) shows the I-V characteristics of the bakelite RPC and Fig. 3(b) shows the current
stability of the bakelite RPC at ±6kV.

3.3 Efﬁciency and noise rate

Authors Suppressed Due to Excessive Length

The efﬁciency and noise rate of the RPC with cosmic rays have been was measured.
An efﬁcieny plateau was obtained for the RPC beyond 8000V. The efﬁciency, as
shown in ﬁgure-4(a) was found to be ∼98%. During this test, noise rate of the RPC
was also calculated and was found to be ∼1.7 Hz/cm2 at 9000V. A linearly varying
behaviour of the noise rate with the applied voltage is shown in ﬁgure.4(b).

Fig. 4 Fig. 4(a) shows the efﬁciency and Fig. 4(b) shows the noise rate of fabricated the bakelite
RPC and.

4 Fabrication of large bakelite RPC

With the successful results of the samll (30cm X 30cm X 0.2cm) bakelite RPC and
acceptable values of bulk and surface resistivity of the bakelite sample, we have
started to develope large size (240cm X 120cm X 0.2cm) bakelite RPC. Figure 5(a)
shows the various steps towards the fabrication of such a large size RPC and ﬁgure
5(b) shows the large RPC under test.

5 Conclusion

To conclude, the electrical properties of the indigenously produced bakelite sheets
have been found promising for RPC fabrication. A single gap bakelite RPC of di-
mension 30 cm X 30 cm X 0.2 cm has been fabricated and tested with cosmic rays
for current stability, efﬁciency and noise rate. The results satisfy the use of this

bakelite to fabricate RPCs for both ICAL and DUNE-ND. We are in the process of
measuring the time resolution of the detectors. We have also developed large size
(240cm X 120cm X 0.2cm) RPC from the same sample. The test of this RPC is
under process.
