Abstract

Let G be a simple undirected graph and Gσ be the corresponding oriented graph of
G with the orientation σ. The skew energy of Gσ, denoted by εs(Gσ), is deﬁned as
the sum of the singular values of the skew adjacency matrix S(Gσ). In 2010, Adiga

et al. certiﬁed that εs(Gσ) ≤ n√∆, where ∆ is the maximum degree of G of order

n. In this paper, we determine all connected 5-regular oriented graphs of order n with
maximum skew-energy.

Key Words: Oriented graph, Skew-adjacency matrix, Skew energy.

1 Introduction

Let G = (V (G), E(G)) be a simple and undirected graph with vertex set V = V (G) =
{v1, v2, . . . , vn} and edge set E(G) = {e1, e2, . . . , em}. For any v ∈ V , we denote by d(v) = dG(v)
and N (v) = NG(v) respectively the degree and the neighborhood of v in G. Denote by ∆ = ∆(G)
the maximum degree of G and G[W ] the subgraph of G induced by the subset W ⊆ V (G). Let Gσ be
an oriented graph of G with the orientation σ, which assigns to each edge of G a direction so that the
resulting graph Gσ becomes an oriented graph. Denote by (u, v) the arc of Gσ, with tail u and head
v. We call G the underlying graph of Gσ. Here we take V (Gσ) = V (G), NGσ (v) = NG(v) = N (v).
Let A(G) be the (0, 1)-adjacency matrix of G. The skew-adjacency matrix of Gσ is the n × n
matrix S(Gσ) = [sij], sij = 1 whenever (vi, vj) ∈ E(Gσ), sij = −1 whenever (vj, vi) ∈ E(Gσ),
sij = 0 otherwise. Denote by εs(Gσ) the skew energy of Gσ, which is deﬁned as the sum of the
singular values of S(Gσ). Since S(Gσ) is a skew-symmetric matrix, the sum of the singular values of
S(Gσ) is the sum of the absolute values of its eigenvalues.

In [8], Gutman introduced the energy of a simple undirected graph. Since several results on
the energy of the adjacent matrix of a graph have been obtained [8, 9, 11]. Recently more concepts
of graph energy are studied, such as Laplacian energy, signless Laplacian energy, incidence energy,
distance energy for an undirected graph, the skew energy and skew Laplacian energy for an oriented
graph, see [9] and [11]. The recent achievements about skew energy are collected in [10].

In [1], Adiga et al. ﬁrst introduced the skew energy of an oriented graph. In particular, a sharp
upper bound for the skew energy of an oriented graph Gσ was obtained in terms of order n and
maximum degree ∆ of G, that is

εs(Gσ) ≤ n√∆.

They pointed out that εs(Gσ) = n√∆ if and only if S(Gσ)T S(Gσ) = ∆In, where In is the
identity matrix of order n. In the following, we call an oriented graph Gσ on n vertices with maximum
degree ∆ an optimum skew energy oriented graph if and only if εs(Gσ) = n√∆. At the same time
the orientation σ is called the optimum orientation.

Which k-regular graphs G on n vertices have orientations σ satisfying εs(Gσ) = n√k?
In [1], Adiga et al. solved the problem for situations of k = 1 and k = 2. A 1-regular graph on n
vertices has skew energy is n if and only if n is even and the graph is n/2 copies of K2, A 2-regular
graph on n vertices has skew energy n√2 if and only if n is a multiple of 4 and it is a union of n/4
copies of C4.

Then, Tian determined the optimum orientations for hypercubes [12]. In [6], Gong and Xu char-
acterized all connected 3-regular oriented graphs with optimum skew energy, they are the complete
graph K4 and the hypercube Q3. In [7], Gong et al. considered the connected 4-regular oriented
graphs with optimum skew energy, they found the possible connected 4-regular underlying graphs,
which are U3, Un(n ≥ 5), Q4, P2(cid:3)K4 and the graph G1 in Fig 2.2 of [7]. In [3], Chen et al. con-
centrated on the connected 4-regular oriented graphs with optimum skew energy, they found the same
ﬁve underlying graphs in another way.

There is a connection between the above question and matrix theory. A weighing matrix W =
W (n; k) (see [4]) is deﬁned as a square (0,±1) matrix with k non-zero entries per row and column
and inner product of distinct rows equal to zero. Therefore, we know W W T = kIn. In fact the skew
adjacency matrix of a optimum skew energy oriented graph is a skew symmetric weighing matrix.

In this paper, we continue to investigate the above question and determine all connected 5-regular

oriented graphs of order n with maximum skew energy.

2 The possible underlying graphs of connected 5-regular oriented graphs

with optimum skew energy

If each pair of neighborhoods of a graph have even number of common vertices, then this graph
is called to have even neighborhood property. As we shall see, every 5-regular oriented graph with
optimum skew energy has even neighborhood property. In this section, we characterize all connected
5-regular graphs of order n with this property.

Lemma 2.1. (Theorem 2.5 and Corollary 2.6 of [1]) Let Gσ be an oriented graph of G on n vertices
with maximum degree ∆. Then εs(Gσ) 6 n√∆ with equality if and only if S(Gσ)T S(Gσ) = ∆In,
where In is the identity matrix of order n.

Lemma 2.2. (Lemma 2.7 of [1]) Let S(Gσ) be the skew adjacency matrix of Gσ, if S(Gσ)T S(Gσ)
= kIn, then |N (u) ∩ N (v)| is even for any distinct vertices u and v of Gσ. In particular, if Gσ is a
5-regular oriented graph of order n satisfying S(Gσ)T S(Gσ) = 5In, then |N (u)∩ N (v)| ∈ {0, 2, 4}
for any two distinct vertices u and v of Gσ.

Lemma 2.3. Let G1 and G2 be vertex disjoint graphs. Then G1 and G2 have optimum orientations if
and only if the union of G1 and G2 does.

The following observation allows one to restrict attention to connected graphs. For any 5-regular
oriented graph Gσ of order n with optimum skew energy n√5, we will discuss the following three
cases for the underlying graph G of 5-regular oriented graphs Gσ. That is,

• G contains K4 as an induced subgraph.
• G contains a K3 but not K4 as an induced subgraph.
• G contains no K3.
In order to determine the connected 5-regular graphs with the even neighborhood property, we
ﬁrst introduce ﬁrstly a procedure table. The ﬁrst column of the table denotes the vertices vi (i =
1, 2, . . . , n) of the graph, and the other columns of the table are the neighbors of the vertex vi for
every row. From the table, we will compare the neighborhoods of any two vertices in the graph and
determine the neighbors of each vertex in the graph. Finally, we will ﬁnd the underlying connected
5-regular graphs G with the even neighborhood property of optimum skew energy oriented graphs
Gσ.

Next we introduce an algorithm how to obtain the procedure table which will be used in Theo-

rems 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 respectively.

Step 1. Choose a vertex v1 of graph G and its neighbors v2, v3, v4, v5, v6, then show them in the

table.

3

Step 2. Preliminarily determine the neighbors of v2, v3, v4, v5, v6 according to whether the graph

contains K4 or K3.

Step 3. Compare the neighborhoods of any two vertices vi and vj in the table. If |N (vi)∩ N (vj)|
is odd, then ﬁnd new neighbor(s) for vi and vj from the table such that |N (vi) ∩ N (vj)| is even under
the conditions that the graph is 5-regular with even neighborhood property and whether the graph
contains K4 or K3. If such new neighbor(s) do not exist for all pairs of vertices vi and vj in the table,
then go to Step 4.

Step 4. If the degree of every vertex in the table is 5, stop; else choose a vertex v with degree
less than 5 and that is not adjacent to any vertex of the table. Then add a new vertex u to the table
such that u is adjacent to v, and return to Step 3.

In the following, every step will be shown by an area enveloped in dotted line. We will explain

how to use it in the progress of obtaining G1 and G2 of Theorem 2.4.

The graphs in Figure 1 are the connected 5-regular graphs with the even neighborhood property

that contains K4 as an induced graph.

Theorem 2.4. Let Gσ be a connected 5-regular oriented graph on n vertices with optimum skew
energy n√5. If the underlying graph G contains K4 as an induced subgraph, then G must be one of
the following graphs with the even neighborhood property depicted in Figure 1.

Proof. Since G is a connected 5-regular graph which contains K4 as an induced subgraph, let V (G[K4])
= {v1, v2, v3, v4} and the other neighbors are v5, v6. Clearly any two vertices of {v1, v2, v3, v4}
are adjacent. This corresponds to Step 1 and Step 2 of Table 1. From Lemma 2.2, we know
|N (v1)∩ N (v2)| is even. Thus, if v2v5 ∈ E(G), we deduce v2v6 ∈ E(G). Similarly, if v3v5 ∈ E(G)
then v3v6 ∈ E(G), if v4v5 ∈ E(G) then v4v6 ∈ E(G). Suppose a = |{v5, v6} ∩ N (v2)|,
b = |{v5, v6} ∩ N (v3)|, c = |{v5, v6} ∩ N (v4)|. Therefore the possible value for (a, b, c) is one
of {(2, 2, 2), (2, 2, 0), (2, 0, 2), (0, 2, 2), (2, 0, 0), (0, 2, 0), (0, 0, 2), (0, 0, 0)}. If we do not consider
the labeling order of v2, v3, v4, We only need to discuss four cases (2, 2, 2), (2, 2, 0), (2, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0).

Case 1. (a, b, c) = (2, 2, 2).
In this case, we know that N (v5) ⊇ {v1, v2, v3, v4} and N (v1) = {v2, v3, v4, v5, v6}. Applying
Lemma 2.2 to |N (v1)∩ N (v5)|, we have v6 ∈ N (v5), Thus N (v5) = {v1, v2, v3, v4, v6} and d(vi) =
5, for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. This corresponds to Step 3 of Table 1.

Now, the degree of every vertex is 5 and the graph is connected, so the graph G1 is found.
The resulting graph is G1 ∼= K6 with the even neighborhood property depicted in Figure 1. We

have shown the progress of obtaining G1 in Table 1.

Case 2. (a, b, c) = (2, 2, 0).
In this case, N (v2) = {v1, v3, v4, v5, v6}, N (v3) = {v1, v2, v4, v5, v6}, v4v5 /∈ E(G) and

v4v6 /∈ E(G).

There must be two new vertices v7, v8 ∈ N (v4). Applying Lemma 2.2 to |N (v7) ∩N (v1)|,
either v7v5 ∈ E(G) or v7v6 ∈ E(G), and not both. Without loss of generality, let v7v5 ∈ E(G)
and v7v6 /∈ E(G). Then N (v6) ∩ N (v4) ⊇ {v1, v2, v3}, so v6v8 ∈ E(G) from Lemma 2.2. We
deduce that v5v6 /∈ E(G), otherwise |N (v1) ∩ N (v5)| = 3 and d(v1) = d(v5) = 5, which contradict
to Lemma 2.2. Since d(v6) = 5, there is another new neighbor v9 of v6. Applying Lemma 2.2 to
|N (v5) ∩ N (v6)|, either v5v8 ∈ E(G) or v5v9 ∈ E(G). If v5v8 ∈ E(G), then |N (v4) ∩ N (v5)| = 5,
which contradicts to Lemma 2.2. Thus v5v8 /∈ E(G) and v5v9 ∈ E(G). So far, we have d(vi) = 5 for
i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and d(vj) = 2 for j = 7, 8, 9. We deduce that v7v8 /∈ E(G), v8v9 /∈ E(G), v7v9 /∈
E(G). Otherwise, without loss of generality, we assume v7v8 ∈ E(G), then |N (v4) ∩ N (v7)| = 1.
While N (v4) = {v1, v2, v3, v7, v8}, d(v1) = d(v2) = d(v3) = 5 and the graph is a simple graph, so
there is a contradiction. Similarly, v8v9 /∈ E(G), v7v9 /∈ E(G).

Now v7 has three new neighbors, denoted by v10, v11, v12. From |N (v4) ∩ N (v10)|, we know
v8v10 ∈ E(G). Similarly we consider |N (v4)∩N (v11)|,|N (v4)∩N (v12)|,|N (v5)∩N (v10)|,|N (v5)∩
N (v11)| and |N (v5) ∩ N (v12)|, respectively. We deduce v8v11 ∈ E(G),
v8v12 ∈ E(G), v9v10 ∈ E(G), v9v11 ∈ E(G) and v9v12 ∈ E(G), respectively.

Next, we will discuss the following two cases.
Case 2.1. There is a pair of adjacent vertices in {v10, v11, v12}.
Without loss of generality, let v10v11 ∈ E(G), then N (v7) = {v4, v5, v10, v11, v12}, N (v7) ∩
N (v10) ⊇ {v11} and d(v4) = d(v5) = 5. By Lemma 2.2, v10v12 ∈ E(G), similarly v11v12 ∈ E(G).
Since d(vi) = 5 for i = 1, 2, . . . , 12, the graph is G2 with the even neighborhood property as shown
in Figure 1.

From Case 2 to here, every paragraph above corresponds a progress shown by an area enveloped
in dotted line in Table 2. In the following, all progress of proving Theorems 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 can be
shown in some similar procedure tables.

Case 2.2. No vertices among {v10, v11, v12} are adjacent.
In this case, there must be two new neighbors v13, v14 of v10. By Lemma 2.2, exactly one of
v11v13 and v12v13 is an edge of G. Without loss of generality, assume v11v13 is an edge of G. By
Lemma 2.2, v12v14 is an edge and v11v14 is not. Thus there exists a new vertex v15 that is adjacent to
v11, and by Lemma 2.2 we have v12v15 is an edge. Now, d(v10) = d(v11) = d(v12) = 5, d(v13) =
d(v14) = d(v15) = 2.

We deduce v13v14 /∈ E(G), v13v15 /∈ E(G) and v14v15 /∈ E(G). Otherwise, without loss of
generality, we assume v13v14 ∈ E(G). Then N (v10) = {v7, v8, v9, v13, v14}, N (v10) ∩ N (v13) =
{v14}, and d(v7) = d(v8) = d(v9) = 5. This is a contradiction to Lemma 2.2. Thus there exist three
new neighbors v16, v17, v18 of v13. Since |N (v13) ∩ N (v14)| is even, without of loss generality, we
may assume v14v16 ∈ E(G). Similarly, v15v16 ∈ E(G) (since |N (v11) ∩ N (v16)|), v14v17 ∈ E(G)
(|N (v10) ∩ N (v17)|), v15v17 ∈ E(G) (|N (v11) ∩ N (v17)|), v14v18 ∈ E(G) (|N (v10) ∩ N (v18)|),

6

v15v18 ∈ E(G) (|N (v11) ∩ N (v18)|).

Now we need to know the adjacency relationship of v16, v17, v18, which is similar to the adja-
cency relationship of v10, v11, v12. By further discussion, we obtain a class of graph G3 with order
n ≥ 12 and the even neighborhood property as shown in Figure 1.

Case 3. (a, b, c) = (2, 0, 0).
By using a similar method to that used in Cases 1 and 2, we ﬁnd underlying graphs G4, G5, G6,

G7, G8, Details are as follows.

In this case v3v5 /∈ E(G), v3v6 /∈ E(G), v4v5 /∈ E(G), v4v6 /∈ E(G). Let the new neighbors of
v3 be v7, v8. Applying Lemma 2.2 to |N (v5) ∩ N (v2)|, we obtain v5v6 ∈ E(G). Next we discuss the
following three cases.

Case 3.1. v4v7 ∈ E(G) and v5v7 ∈ E(G).
We deduce v4v8 ∈ E(G) (|N (v3) ∩ N (v4)|). Similarly v7v8 ∈ E(G) (|N (v4) ∩ N (v7)|),
v5v8 ∈ E(G) (|N (v4)∩ N (v5)|), v6v7 ∈ E(G) (|N (v1)∩ N (v7)|), v6v8 ∈ E(G) (|N (v1)∩ N (v8)|).
Now d(vi) = 5, for i = 1, 2, . . . , 8. The graph is G4 with the even neighborhood property as shown
in Figure 1.

Case 3.2. v4v7 ∈ E(G) and v5v7 /∈ E(G).
We know v4v8 ∈ E(G) (|N (v3)∩ N (v4)|), v7v8 ∈ E(G) (|N (v4)∩ N (v7)|), v5v8 /∈ E(G) from
v5v7 /∈ E(G) and |N (v4) ∩ N (v5)|. There are two new neighbors v9, v10 of v5 and v6v9 ∈ E(G)
(|N (v1) ∩ N (v9)|), v6v10 ∈ E(G) (|N (v1) ∩ N (v10)|).
Case 3.2.1. {v7v9, v7v10, v8v9, v8v10} ∩ E(G) 6= ∅.
Without loss of generality, we assume that v7v9 ∈ E(G). Then v7v10 ∈ E(G) (|N (v6)∩N (v7)|),
v8v9 ∈ E(G) (|N (v3)∩N (v9)|), v8v10 ∈ E(G) (|N (v6)∩N (v8)|), v9v10 ∈ E(G) (|N (v5)∩N (v9)|).
The graph G5 is found as shown in Figure 1.

Case 3.2.2. {v7v9, v7v10, v8v9, v8v10} ∩ E(G) = ∅.
There are two new neighbors v11, v12 of v7. Then v8v11 ∈ E(G) (|N (v3) ∩ N (v11)|), v8v12 ∈
E(G) (|N (v3) ∩ N (v12)|), v11v12 ∈ E(G) (|N (v7) ∩ N (v11)|), v9v10 ∈ E(G) (|N (v5) ∩ N (v9)|).
Next we should discuss whether {v9v11, v9v12, v10v11, v10v12} ∩ E(G) = ∅ or not. This dis-
cussion is similar to the discussion that whether {v7v9, v7v10, v8v9, v8v10} ∩ E(G) = ∅ or not. With
further discussion, we obtain a class of graph which is isomorphic to G6 with order n ≥ 8 in Figure
1.

Case 3.3. v4v7 /∈ E(G).
We deduce v4v8 /∈ E(G) (|N (v3) ∩ N (v4)|). Then there exist two new neighbors v9, v10 of
v4. Now |N (v7) ∩ N (v1)|, so either v5v7 ∈ E(G) or v6v7 ∈ E(G), and not both. While N (v5) ⊇
{v1, v2, v6} and N (v6) ⊇ {v1, v2, v5}, without loss of generality, we assume v5v7 ∈ E(G) and
v6v7 /∈ E(G). Then v5v8 ∈ E(G) (|N (v3) ∩ N (v5)|). v6v7 /∈ E(G) and |N (v5) ∩ N (v6)| imply
v6v8 /∈ E(G). |N (v4)∩ N (v7)| implies either v7v9 ∈ E(G) or v7v10 ∈ E(G), and not both. Without

loss of generality, we assume v7v9 ∈ E(G) and v7v10 /∈ E(G).

Similarly, we know either v8v9 ∈ E(G) or v8v10 ∈ E(G). But if v8v9 ∈ E(G), N (v3) ∩
N (v9) = {v4, v7, v8} and for the other neighbors v1, v2 of v3, d(v1) = d(v2) = 5. So v8v9 /∈ E(G)
and v8v10 ∈ E(G).

Now v6v9 ∈ E(G) (|N (v1) ∩ N (v9)|), similarly v6v10 ∈ E(G). We deduce v7v8 /∈ E(G)
(|N (v5) ∩ N (v7)|), coupled with v7v10 /∈ E(G), so there are two new neighbors v11, v12 of v7.
Then v8v11 ∈ E(G) (|N (v3) ∩ N (v11)|), similarly v8v12 ∈ E(G). Next we consider whether
{v9v11, v9v12, v10v11, v10v12} ∩ E(G) = ∅ or not.

Similar to Cases 3.2.1 and 3.2.2, we obtain the graphs G7 and G8 depicted in Figure 1.
Case 4. (a, b, c) = (0, 0, 0).
Similarly, we ﬁnd the underlying graphs G9, G10, G11, G12, G13, G14 with the even neighbors

property. Details are as follows

In this situation we have v2v5 /∈ E(G), v3v5 /∈ E(G), v4v5 /∈ E(G). So v5v6 /∈ E(G),

otherwise |N (v1) ∩ N (v5)| = 1, which contradicts to Lemma 2.2.

Thus there are two new neighbors v7, v8 of v2.

|N (v2) ∩ N (v5)| implies v5v7 ∈ E(G) or
v5v8 ∈ E(G). Without loss of generality, let v5v7 ∈ E(G) and v5v8 /∈ E(G). Now we are not sure
whether v3v7 ∈ E(G), v4v7 ∈ E(G) or not, We note that v3 and v4 are symmetric, so we only need
to discuss the three cases according to |{v3v7, v4v7} ∩ E(G)|.

Case 4.1. |{v3, v4} ∩ N (v7)| = 2.
In this case, v3v7 ∈ E(G) and v4v7 ∈ E(G). Then v3v8 ∈ E(G) (|N (v2) ∩ N (v3)|), v4v8 ∈

E(G) (|N (v3) ∩ N (v4)|). |N (v1) ∩ N (v8)| implies v5v8 ∈ E(G) or v6v8 ∈ E(G), and not both.

We deduce v5v8 /∈ E(G), otherwise |N (v4) ∩ N (v5)| contradicts to Lemma 2.2, so v5v8 /∈
E(G) and v6v8 ∈ E(G). Then v6v7 /∈ E(G) (|N (v4) ∩ N (v6)|), coupled with v5v8 /∈ E(G) and
|N (v7) ∩ N (v8)|, so v7 and v8 have another common neighbor, denote it by v9. Then v5v6 /∈ E(G)
(|N (v1) ∩ N (v5)|), v5v9 /∈ E(G) (|N (v5) ∩ N (v7)|). So v5 has three new neighbors, denoted by
v10, v11, v12. Then v6v10 ∈ E(G) (|N (v1) ∩ N (v10)|), v9v10 ∈ E(G) (|N (v7) ∩ N (v10)|). Similarly
v6v11 ∈ E(G)(|N (v1) ∩ N (v11)|), v9v11 ∈ E(G)(|N (v7) ∩ N (v11)|), v6v12 ∈ E(G)(|N (v1) ∩
N (v12)|), v9v12 ∈ E(G)(|N (v7) ∩ N (v12)|). Now N (v10) ⊇ {v5, v6, v9}, N (v11) ⊇ {v5, v6, v9},
N (v12) ⊇ {v5, v6, v9}.

Case 4.1.1. {v10v11, v10v12, v11v12} ∩ E(G) 6= ∅.
Without loss of generality, let v10v11 ∈ E(G). Then v10v12 ∈ E(G) (|N (v9) ∩ N (v10)|),
v11v12 ∈ E(G) (|N (v10) ∩ N (v11)|). Now d(vi) = 5 for i = 1, 2, ..., 12, then the graph is G9 as
shown in Figure 1.

Case 4.1.2. {v10v11, v10v12, v11v12} ∩ E(G) = ∅.
Similar to Case 4.1.1, we obtain the graph G10 as shown in Figure 1.
Case 4.2. |{v3, v4} ∩ N (v7)| = 1.

Without loss of generality, let v3v7 ∈ E(G) and v4v7 /∈ E(G). Then v3v8 ∈ E(G) (|N (v2) ∩
N (v3)|), |N (v1) ∩ N (v7)| implies either v4v7 ∈ E(G) or v6v7 ∈ E(G), and not both. Coupled
with v4v7 /∈ E(G), we conclude v6v7 ∈ E(G).
|N (v2) ∩ N (v7)| implies either v4v7 ∈ E(G) or
v7v8 ∈ E(G), and not both. Coupled with v4v7 /∈ E(G), we conclude that v7v8 ∈ E(G). Then
v4v8 /∈ E(G) (|N (v3) ∩ N (v4)|). There are two neighbors v9, v10 of v4. |N (v4) ∩ N (v5)| implies
v5v9 ∈ E(G) or v5v10 ∈ E(G), and not both. Without loss of generality, let v5v9 ∈ E(G) and
v5v10 /∈ E(G). |N (v4) ∩ N (v6)| implies either v6v9 ∈ E(G) or v6v10 ∈ E(G), and not both.

We claim that v6v9 /∈ E(G). Otherwise N (v1) ∩ N (v9) = {v4, v5, v6} and for the other neigh-
bors v2 and v3 of v1, d(v2) = d(v3) = 5. This contradicts to Lemma 2.2, so v6v9 /∈ E(G) and
v6v10 ∈ E(G).

|N (v2) ∩ N (v9)| implies either v7v9 ∈ E(G) or v8v9 ∈ E(G), and not both. But d(v7) = 5,
so v8v9 ∈ E(G). Similarly v8v10 ∈ E(G) (|N (v2) ∩ N (v10)|), v5v6 /∈ E(G) (|N (v1) ∩ N (v5)|),
v5v10 /∈ E(G) (|N (v4) ∩ N (v5)|). There are two new neighbors v11, v12 of v5. Then v6v11 ∈ E(G)
(|N (v1) ∩ N (v11)|). Similarly v6v12 ∈ E(G), v9v10 /∈ E(G) (|N (v8) ∩ N (v9)|). So far, d(v9) =
d(v10) = 3, d(v11) = d(v12) = 2.

Case 4.2.1. {v9v11, v9v12, v10v11, v10v12} ∩ E(G) 6= ∅.
Without loss of generality, let v9v11 ∈ E(G). Then v9v12 ∈ E(G) (|N (v6) ∩ N (v9)|), v10v11 ∈
E(G) (|N (v4) ∩ N (v11)|). Similarly v10v12 ∈ E(G) (N (v4) ∩ N (v12)). Then v11v12 ∈ E(G)
(|N (v6) ∩ N (v11)|). Since d(vi) = 5 for i = 1, 2, ..., 12, the graph is G11 as shown in Figure 1.

Case 4.2.2. {v9v11, v9v12, v10v11, v10v12} ∩ E(G) = ∅.
Similarly, we obtain the graph G12 with order n ≥ 12 as shown in Figure 1.
Case 4.3. |{v3, v4} ∩ N (v7)| = 0.
In this case, v3v7 /∈ E(G). Then v3v8 /∈ E(G) (|N (v2) ∩ N (v3)|), so there are another two new
neighbors v9, v10 of v3. |N (v3)∩ N (v5)| implies either v5v9 ∈ E(G) or v5v10 ∈ E(G), and not both.
Without loss of generality, let v5v9 ∈ E(G) and v5v10 /∈ E(G). v4v7 /∈ E(G) and |N (v2) ∩ N (v4)|
imply v4v8 /∈ E(G). So far, we do not know whether v4v9 ∈ E(G) or not. Next we will discuss the
following two cases.

Case 4.3.1. v4v9 ∈ E(G).
In this case, v4v10 ∈ E(G) (|N (v3) ∩ N (v4)|), v6v9 ∈ E(G) (|N (v1) ∩ N (v9)|), and v9v10 ∈
|N (v3) ∩ N (v7)| implies either v7v9 ∈ E(G) or v7v10 ∈ E(G), and
E(G) (|N (v3) ∩ N (v9)|).
not both. Since d(v9) = 5, v7v10 ∈ E(G) and v7v9 /∈ E(G).
|N (v3) ∩ N (v8)| implies either
v8v9 ∈ E(G) or v8v10 ∈ E(G), and not both. Since d(v9) = 5, v8v9 /∈ E(G) and v8v10 ∈ E(G).
|N (v1) ∩ N (v8)| implies either v5v8 ∈ E(G) or v6v8 ∈ E(G), and not both.

We claim that v5v8 /∈ E(G). Otherwise if v5v8 ∈ E(G), then |N (v2) ∩ N (v5)| implies either

v3v5 ∈ E(G) or v4v5 ∈ E(G), and not both. But d(v3) = d(v4) = 5, this is a contradiction.

So v5v8 /∈ E(G), v6v8 ∈ E(G). So far, d(v5) = d(v6) = d(v7) = d(v8) = 3, |N (v1) ∩ N (v5)|

9

implies v5v6 /∈ E(G). Coupled with v5v8 /∈ E(G), there are two new neighbors v11, v12 of v5.
Then v6v11 ∈ E(G) (|N (v1) ∩ N (v11)|). Similarly v6v12 ∈ E(G). So far, d(v7) = d(v8) = 3,
d(v11) = d(v12) = 2. This situation is similar to Cases 4.2.1 and 4.2.2, and we obtain the class of
graphs G13 as shown in Figure 1.
Case 4.3.2. v4v9 /∈ E(G).
Similarly, we obtain the graph G14 as shown in Figure 1.

The graphs in Figure 2 are the connected 5-regular graphs with the even neighborhood property

that contains at least a triangle and contains no K4 as an induced subgraph.

Theorem 2.5. Let Gσ be a connected 5-regular optimum skew energy oriented graph on n vertices, if
the underlying graph G contains a triangle and contains no K4 as an induced subgraph, then G must
be one graph depicted in Figure 2.

Figure 2: All the possible underlying graphs for Theorem 2.5.

Proof. We assume the three vertices of a triangle in G are v1, v2, v3. Let v4, v5, v6 be the other three
neighbors of v1. By Lemma 2.2, we know v2 must be adjacent to at least one vertex of v4, v5, v6.
Without loss of generality, let v2v4 ∈ E(G). Since N (v1) ∩ N (v3) ⊇ {v2}, v3 must be adjacent
to at least one vertex of v4, v5, v6. We deduce v3v4 /∈ E(G), otherwise the graph has an induced
subgraph K4 with the induced vertices v1, v2, v3, v4. Then v3v5 ∈ E(G) or v3v6 ∈ E(G), without
loss of generality, we assume that v3v5 ∈ E(G) and v3v6 /∈ E(G). |N (v1) ∩ N (v4)| implies either
v4v5 ∈ E(G) or v4v6 ∈ E(G). Next we will discuss the cases according to whether v4v5 ∈ E(G) or
not.

Case 1. v4v5 ∈ E(G).
We deduce v2v5 /∈ E(G) and v2v6 /∈ E(G), otherwise if v2v5 ∈ E(G), then v2v6 ∈ E(G)
(|N (v1)∩ N (v2)|). Thus the graph has an induced subgraph K4 with vertices v1, v2, v3, v5, so v2v5 /∈
E(G). Then v2v6 /∈ E(G) (|N (v1) ∩ N (v2)|).

Thus there are two new neighbors v7, v8 of v2. |N (v2) ∩ N (v3)| and v3v4 /∈ E(G) imply either
v3v7 ∈ E(G) or v3v8 ∈ E(G), and not both. Without loss of generality, let v3v7 ∈ E(G) and

10

v3v8 /∈ E(G). Then v3v6 /∈ E(G) (|N (v1) ∩ N (v3)|), and thus there is a new neighbors v9 of v3.
|N (v3) ∩ N (v4)| implies either v4v7 ∈ E(G) or v4v9 ∈ E(G), and not both.

We deduce v4v9 /∈ E(G). Otherwise if v4v9 ∈ E(G) and v4v7 /∈ E(G), then v4v8 ∈ E(G)

(|N (v2) ∩ N (v4)|), |N (v2) ∩ N (v5)| implies either v5v7 ∈ E(G) or v5v8 ∈ E(G), not both.

If v5v7 /∈ E(G) and v5v8 ∈ E(G), then v5v9 ∈ E(G) (|N (v3) ∩ N (v5)|). We deduce d(v4) =

d(v5) = 5 and |N (v4) ∩ N (v5)| = 3. This contradicts to Lemma 2.2.

If v5v7 ∈ E(G) and v5v8 /∈ E(G), then v5v9 ∈ E(G) (|N (v4) ∩ N (v5)|). We deduce d(v3) =

d(v5) = 5 and |N (v3) ∩ N (v5)| = 3. This is a contradiction to Lemma 2.2.

So v5v7 /∈ E(G) and v5v8 /∈ E(G). Therefore v4v9 /∈ E(G) and v4v7 ∈ E(G).
We deduce v4v6 /∈ E(G) (|N (v1)∩ N (v4)|), v4v8 /∈ E(G) (|N (v2)∩ N (v4)|) and v4v9 /∈ E(G)
(|N (v3) ∩ N (v4)|), so there is a new neighbor v10 of v4.
|N (v2) ∩ N (v5)| implies either v5v7 ∈
E(G) or v5v8 ∈ E(G), and not both. We claim v5v8 /∈ E(G) and v5v7 ∈ E(G). Otherwise if
v5v8 ∈ E(G) and v5v7 /∈ E(G), then v5v9 ∈ E(G) (|N (v3) ∩ N (v5)|). But d(v4) = d(v5) = 5 and
|N (v4) ∩ N (v5)| = 1, this contradicts to Lemma 2.2. So v5v8 /∈ E(G) and v5v7 ∈ E(G).

We deduce v5v6 /∈ E(G) (|N (v1) ∩ N (v5)|), v5v8 /∈ E(G) (|N (v2) ∩ N (v5)|), v5v9 /∈ E(G)
(|N (v3)∩ N (v5)|), and v5v10 /∈ E(G) (|N (v4)∩ N (v5)|). So there is a new neighbor v11 of v5. Then
v6v11 ∈ E(G) (|N (v1) ∩ N (v11)|). |N (v2) ∩ N (v6)| implies v6v7 ∈ E(G) or v6v8 ∈ E(G), and not
both. But if v6v7 ∈ E(G), then |N (v1) ∩ N (v7)| = 5, so v6v7 /∈ E(G) and v6v8 ∈ E(G). Then
v6v9 ∈ E(G) (|N (v3)∩ N (v6)|), v6v10 ∈ E(G) (|N (v4)∩ N (v6)|), v7v8 /∈ E(G) (|N (v2)∩ N (v7)|),
v7v9 /∈ E(G) (|N (v3) ∩ N (v7)|), v7v10 /∈ E(G) (|N (v6) ∩ N (v7)|), and v7v11 /∈ E(G) (|N (v6) ∩
N (v7)|). So there is a new neighbor v12 of v7. Then v8v12 ∈ E(G) (|N (v2) ∩ N (v12)|), v9v12 ∈
E(G) (|N (v3) ∩ N (v12)|), v10v12 ∈ E(G) (|N (v4) ∩ N (v12)|), v11v12 ∈ E(G) (|N (v5) ∩ N (v12)|),
v8v9 ∈ E(G) (|N (v3)∩N (v8)|), v9v11 ∈ E(G) (|N (v5)∩N (v9)|), v8v10 ∈ E(G) (|N (v4)∩N (v8)|),
and v10v11 ∈ E(G) (|N (v9) ∩ N (v10)|). Since d(vi) = 5 for i = 1, 2, ..., 12, the graph is G15 as
shown in Figure 2.

Case 2. v4v5 /∈ E(G).
In this case we have v4v6 ∈ E(G). |N (v1) ∩ N (v5)| implies either v2v5 ∈ E(G) or v5v6 ∈
E(G), and not both. But if v2v5 ∈ E(G), then there is an induced subgraph K4 with the induced
vertices v1, v2, v3, v5. So v2v5 /∈ E(G) and v5v6 ∈ E(G). Then v2v6 /∈ E(G) (|N (v1) ∩ N (v2)|).
So there are two new neighbors v7, v8 of v2. |N (v2) ∩ N (v3)| implies either v3v7 ∈ E(G) or v3v8 ∈
E(G), and not both. Without loss of generality, let v3v7 ∈ E(G) and v3v8 /∈ E(G). Now v3v4 /∈
E(G), otherwise there is an induced subgraph K4 with induce vertices v1, v2, v3, v4. Then v3v6 /∈
E(G) (|N (v1) ∩ N (v3)|), v3v8 /∈ E(G) (|N (v2) ∩ N (v3)|). So there is a new neighbor v9 of v3.
|N (v2) ∩ N (v4)| implies either v4v7 ∈ E(G) or v4v8 ∈ E(G), and not both.

We claim v4v7 /∈ E(G) and v4v8 ∈ E(G). Otherwise if v4v7 ∈ E(G), v4v9 ∈ E(G) (|N (v3) ∩

N (v4)|), |N (v7) ∩ N (v1)| implies either v5v7 ∈ E(G) or v6v7 ∈ E(G).

11

If v5v7 ∈ E(G), then v5v9 ∈ E(G) (|N (v4) ∩ N (v5)|). But |N (v3) ∩ N (v5)| = 3 and d(v3) =

d(v5) = 5, this contradicts to Lemma 2.2.

If v6v7 ∈ E(G), similarly we obtain v6v9 ∈ E(G), |N (v4)∩N (v6)| = 3 and d(v4) = d(v6) = 5,

this contradicts to Lemma 2.2.

Thus we know v4v7 /∈ E(G) and v4v8 ∈ E(G). Then v4v5 /∈ E(G) (|N (v1) ∩ N (v4)|),
|N (v3) ∩ N (v4)| implies v4v7 /∈ E(G) and v4v9 /∈ E(G), so there is a new neighbor v10 of v4. Then
v7v8 ∈ E(G) (|N (v2)∩ N (v7)|). |N (v3)∩ N (v5)| implies either v5v7 ∈ E(G) or v5v9 ∈ E(G), and
not both. We claim v5v7 /∈ E(G), otherwise v5v7 ∈ E(G) and v6v7 ∈ E(G) (|N (v1) ∩ N (v7)|). But
d(v4) = d(v7) = 5 and |N (v4) ∩ N (v7)| = 3, this contradicts to Lemma 2.2. So v5v7 /∈ E(G) and
v5v9 ∈ E(G).

Now v5v8 /∈ E(G) (|N (v4) ∩ N (v5)|), v5v10 /∈ E(G) (|N (v4) ∩ N (v5)|). So there is a new
neighbor v11 of v5. Then v7v9 ∈ E(G) (|N (v3)∩N (v9)|), v6v10 ∈ E(G) (|N (v1)∩N (v10)|), v6v11 ∈
E(G) (|N (v1) ∩ N (v11)|), v7v10 /∈ E(G) (|N (v6) ∩ N (v7)|), v7v11 /∈ E(G) (|N (v6) ∩ N (v7)|).
So there is a new neighbor v12 of v7. Then v8v12 ∈ E(G) (|N (v2) ∩ N (v12)|), v9v12 ∈ E(G)
(|N (v3)∩N (v12)|), v10v12 ∈ E(G) (|N (v4)∩N (v12)|), v11v12 ∈ E(G) (|N (v5)∩N (v12)|), v8v10 ∈
E(G) (|N (v4)∩ N (v8)|), and v9v11 ∈ E(G) (|N (v5)∩ N (v9)|), v10v11 ∈ E(G) (|N (v9)∩ N (v10)|).
Since d(vi) = 5 for i = 1, 2, ..., 12, the graph is G16 as shown in Figure 2.

The graphs in Figure 3 are the connected 5-regular graphs with the even neighborhood property

that contains no K3 as an induced subgraph.

Theorem 2.6. Let Gσ be a connected 5-regular optimum skew energy oriented graph on n vertices.
If the underlying graph G contains no triangle, then G is one of the graphs depicted in Figure 3.

Proof. Since the graph G is triangle-free, any two vertices which are adjacent to a common vertex in
G are not be adjacent.

Let v1 ∈ V (G) and N (v1) = {v2, v3, v4, v5, v6}, then v2 is not adjacent to any vertices of
v3, v4, v5, v6. So there are four new neighbors v7, v8, v9, v10 of v2. Now N (v1) ∩ N (v7) ⊇ {v2}, by
Lemma 2.2 we know the possible values of |N (v1)∩ N (v7)| are 2 or 4. Similarly |N (v1)∩ N (v8)| =
2 or 4, |N (v1) ∩ N (v9)| = 2 or 4, |N (v1) ∩ N (v10)| = 2 or 4. Let ai = |N (v1) ∩ N (vi+6)|,
for i = 1, 2, 3, 4. By symmetry, we only need to consider the following cases according to the
vector (a1, a2, a3, a4). They are (4, 4, 4, 4), (4, 4, 4, 2), (4, 4, 2, 2), (4, 2, 2, 2), (2, 2, 2, 2). We assume
S1 = {v3, v4, v5, v6} and S2 = {v7, v8, v9, v10} for convenience.

Case 1. (a1, a2, a3, a4) = (4, 4, 4, 4).
Now every vertex of S1 and S2 has just three neighbors in the other set.
Firstly, we prove the four sets N (v7)∩S1, N (v8)∩S1, N (v9)∩S1, N (v10)∩S1 are different each
other. Otherwise, without loss of generality, let N (v7)∩ S1 = N (v8)∩ S1, and v3v7 ∈ E(G), v4v7 ∈

E(G), v5v7 ∈ E(G), v3v8 ∈ E(G), v4v8 ∈ E(G), and v5v8 ∈ E(G). Now N (v7) ⊇ {v2, v3, v4, v5},
N (v8) ⊇ {v2, v3, v4, v5}, N (v1) = {v2, v3, v4, v5, v6}, obviously v6v7 /∈ E(G), and v6v8 /∈ E(G).
Since N (v2) ∩ N (v6) ⊇ {v1}, v6v9 ∈ E(G) or v6v10 ∈ E(G), and not both. While N (v9) ⊇ {v2},
N (v10) ⊇ {v2}, without loss of generality we assume v6v9 ∈ E(G) and v6v10 /∈ E(G).

Since a3 = |N (v1) ∩ N (v9)| = 4 and v2v9 ∈ E(G), v6v9 ∈ E(G), and there are two neighbors
of v9 in {v3, v4, v5}. Without loss of generality let v3v9 ∈ E(G), v4v9 ∈ E(G) and v5v9 /∈ E(G).
Now N (v3) ⊇ {v1, v7, v8, v9}, N (v4) ⊇ {v1, v7, v8, v9}, N (v2) = {v1, v7, v8, v9, v10}. Then
v3v10 /∈ E(G), v4v10 /∈ E(G), and a4 6 5 − 2 = 3, this contradicts to a4 = 4.

Because (a1, a2, a3, a4) = (4, 4, 4, 4), S1 = {v3, v4, v5, v6} and S2 = {v7, v8, v9, v10}, every
vertex of S2 is not adjacent to one vertex of S1. From the proof above, we know any two vertices of S2
have not three common neighbors in S1. Without loss of generality, let v4v7 ∈ E(G), v5v7 ∈ E(G),
v6v7 ∈ E(G), v3v7 /∈ E(G), v3v8 ∈ E(G), v5v8 ∈ E(G), v6v8 ∈ E(G), v4v8 /∈ E(G), v3v9 ∈
E(G), v4v9 ∈ E(G), v6v9 ∈ E(G), v5v9 /∈ E(G), v3v10 ∈ E(G), v4v10 ∈ E(G), v5v10 ∈ E(G),
v6v10 /∈ E(G). The four sets N (v7) ∩ S1, N (v8)∩ S1, N (v9) ∩ S1, N (v10) ∩ S1 are different to each
other.

Since the graph contains no K3, then v7v8 /∈ E(G), v7v9 /∈ E(G), v7v10 /∈ E(G). v3v7 /∈ E(G),
otherwise |N (v2) ∩ N (v3)| = 5. Therefore there is a new neighbor v11 of v7. Then v8v11 ∈ E(G)
(|N (v7)∩ N (v8)|), v9v11 ∈ E(G) (|N (v7)∩ N (v9)|), v10v11 ∈ E(G) (|N (v7)∩ N (v10)|). Since the
graph contains no triangle, similarly there is a new neighbor v12 of v3. Then v4v12 ∈ E(G) (|N (v3)∩
N (v4)|), v5v12 ∈ E(G) (|N (v3)∩ N (v5)|), v6v12 ∈ E(G) (|N (v3)∩ N (v6)|). |N (v6)∩ N (v11)| and
d(v1) = 5 imply v11v12 ∈ E(G). Since d(vi) = 5 for i = 1, 2, . . . , 12, the graph is G17 as shown in
Figure 3.

Case 2. (a1, a2, a3, a4) = (4, 4, 4, 2).
By using a method similar to that used in Case 1 of Theorem 2.6, we ﬁnd the underlying graph

G18 depicted in Figure 3.

Case 3. (a1, a2, a3, a4) = (4, 4, 2, 2).
Similarly, we ﬁnd G19 and G20 as shown in Figure 3.
Case 4. (a1, a2, a3, a4) = (4, 2, 2, 2).
Similarly, we ﬁnd G21, G22, G23, G24, G25, G26 as shown in Figure 3.
Case 5. (a1, a2, a3, a4) = (2, 2, 2, 2).
Now let G3 = G[S1 ∪ S2] = G[v3, . . . , v10]. Since (a1, a2, a3, a4) = (2, 2, 2, 2), |E(G3)| =
(2 − 1) + (2 − 1) + (2 − 1) + (2 − 1) = 4. N (v2) ∩ N (v3) = {v1}, so we claim every vertex of S1
and S2 has just one neighbor in the other set. We say that such vertex sets S1 and S2 are one-to-one
for convenience.

From (a1, a2, a3, a4) = (2, 2, 2, 2), we know N (v1) − {v2} = S1 and N (v2) − {v1} = S2 are
one-to-one. For any two adjacent vertices u1, u2 in V (G), we can assume that N (u1) − {u2} and

14

N (u2)−{u1} are one-to-one, since Case 5 is the last case of the discussion for proving Theorem 2.6.
If there are two adjacent vertices u′
1} are not one-to-one,
2 and N (u′
1, u′
1} must belong to one of Case 1, 2, 3 or 4 by changing vertices
then N (u′
2) − {u′
u1, u2 to v1, v2, respectively. So our assume is reasonable.

2) − {u′

By symmetry and the one-oneness of S1 and S2, we may assume v3v7 ∈ E(G), v4v8 ∈ E(G),
v5v9 ∈ E(G), and v6v10 ∈ E(G). Then v3v8 /∈ E(G), v3v9 /∈ E(G), v3v10 /∈ E(G), v4v7 /∈
E(G), v4v9 /∈ E(G), v4v10 /∈ E(G), v5v7 /∈ E(G), v5v8 /∈ E(G), v5v10 /∈ E(G), v6v7 /∈ E(G),
v6v8 /∈ E(G), and v6v9 /∈ E(G). The graph is triangle-free, so v3v4 /∈ E(G), v3v5 /∈ E(G), and
v3v6 /∈ E(G). Thus there are three new neighbors of v3, denoted by v11, v12, v13. Since v1v3 ∈ E(G),
N (v1)−{v3} = {v2, v4, v5, v6} and N (v3)−{v1} = {v7, v11, v12, v13} are one-to-one, coupled with
v2v7 ∈ E(G) and N (v11) ⊇ {v3}, N (v12) ⊇ {v3}, and N (v13) ⊇ {v3}. Without loss of generality,
let v4v11 ∈ E(G), v5v12 ∈ E(G), and v6v13 ∈ E(G).

The graph is triangle-free, so v3v5 /∈ E(G), and v3v6 /∈ E(G). Since N (v1) − {v2} and
N (v2) − {v1} are one-to-one, v4v7 /∈ E(G), v4v9 /∈ E(G), v4v10 /∈ E(G). Since N (v1) − {v3} and
N (v3) − {v1} are one-to-one, v4v12 /∈ E(G), v4v13 /∈ E(G). There are two new neighbors v14, v15
of v4. Since v1v4 ∈ E(G), N (v1) − {v4} and N (v4) − {v1} are one-to-one. Then N (v1) − {v4} =
{v2, v3, v5, v6}, N (v4) − {v1} = {v8, v11, v14, v15}, v2v8 ∈ E(G), v3v11 ∈ E(G), N (v14) ⊇ {v4},
and N (v15) ⊇ {v4}. Without loss of generality, let v5v14 ∈ E(G), and v6v15 ∈ E(G).

The graph is triangle-free, so v5v6 /∈ E(G), N (v1)−{v2} and N (v2)−{v1} are one-to-one. So
v5v7 /∈ E(G), v5v8 /∈ E(G), v5v10 /∈ E(G), and v6v9 /∈ E(G). Since N (v1) − {v3} and N (v3) −
{v1} are one-to-one, so v5v11 /∈ E(G), v5v13 /∈ E(G), v6v12 /∈ E(G). Since N (v1) − {v4} and
N (v4) − {v1} are one-to-one, so v5v15 /∈ E(G), v6v14 /∈ E(G). Then there is a new neighbor of v5,
say v16. |N (v5)∩ N (v6)| implies v6v16 ∈ E(G) or v6v12 ∈ E(G). Since N (v1)−{v3} and N (v3)−
{v1} are one-to-one, v6v12 /∈ E(G). Thus v6v16 ∈ E(G). The graph is triangle-free so v7v8 /∈ E(G),
v7v9 /∈ E(G), v7v10 /∈ E(G), v7v11 /∈ E(G), v7v12 /∈ E(G), and v7v13 /∈ E(G). Let B =
{v7v14, v7v15, v7v16, v8v12, v8v13, v8v16, v9v11, v9v13, v9v15, v10v11, v10v12, v10v14, v11v16, v12v15,
v13v14}. Next we will discuss the following two cases.

Case 5.1. E(G) ∩ B 6= ∅.
By using a method similar to that used in Case 1 of Theorem 2.6, we ﬁnd G27 as shown in Figure

3.

Case 5.2. E(G) ∩ B = ∅.
Similarly, we ﬁnd G28, G29, G30, G31, G32 as shown in Figure 3.
Now we have found all possible underlying graphs of connected 5-regular optimum skew energy

oriented graphs with the even neighborhood property.

By Theorems 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6, we obtain fourteen classes of all possible underlying graphs of
connected 5-regular oriented graphs of order n with optimum skew energy. These fourteen classes of

15

underlying graphs are (I) G1, (II) G2, G3, G9, G10, (III) G4, G5, G6, (IV) G7, G8, G11, G12, G13,
(V) G14, (VI) G15, (VII) G16, (VIII) G17, G19, G20, G21, (IX) G18, G23, G25, (X) G22, G24, G26, (XI)
G27, (XII) G28, G30, (XIII) G29, (XIV) G31, G32.

3 All connected 5-regular optimum skew energy oriented graphs

In this section, we will prove exactly eleven classes of connected 5-regular graphs obtained in

Section 2 have optimum orientations.

Let Cn = v1v2, . . . , vn be a cycle on n(≥ 3) vertices and C ′

We deﬁne Un = (V (Un), E(Un)) to be the graph obtained from Cn and C ′
vi to ui−1(mod n) and ui+1(mod n) for i = 1, 2, . . . , n, see Fig. 2.1 in [7].

n = u1u2, . . . , un is a copy of C.
n by inserting edges from

The Cartesian product of G1 and G2, denoted by G1(cid:3)G2, is deﬁned as a graph with vertex set
V (G1) × V (G2). Suppose v1, v2 ∈ V (G1) and u1, u2 ∈ V (G2). Then (u1, v1) and (u2, v2) are
adjacent in G1(cid:3)G2 if and only if u1u2 ∈ E(G1), v1 = v2 or u1 = u2, v1v2 ∈ E(G2). For example,
let Q1 = P2, and Qn = Qn−1(cid:3)P2 for n ≥ 2. The graph Qn is called the hypercube graph.
Lemma 3.1. (Lemma 2.8 of [1]) If Kn has an orientation with S(Gσ)T S(Gσ) = (n − 1)In, then n
is a multiple of 4.

Lemma 3.2. (Theorem 3.5 of [5]) Let Gσ be an oriented k-regular graph of G on n vertices with
maximum skew energy εs(Gσ) = n√k. Then the oriented graph (P2✷G)o of P2✷G has the maximum
skew energy εs(Gσ) = 2n√k + 1.

Let S(Gσ) = [sij]n×n be the skew adjacency matrix of Gσ and let W = u1u2 . . . uk (perhaps
ui = uj for i 6= j) be a walk in Gσ joining u1 and uk. The sign of W , denoted by sgn(W ), is deﬁned
as

k−1

sgn(W ) =

suiui+1.

Denote by w+
v with the length k, respectively.

uv(k) and w−

uv(k) the number of all positive walks and negative walks starting u ending

Lemma 3.3. (Lemma 3.7 of [6], Proposition 2.4 of [3]) Let Gσ be a k-regular oriented graph on n
vertices with skew adjacency matrix S = S(Gσ). then ST S = kIn if and only if for any two distinct
vertices u and v of Gσ,

w+

uv(2) = w−

uv(2).

In [6], Gong and Xu presented the following method to construct a new oriented graph with the

optimum skew energy.

Let v be an arbitrary vertex of the oriented graph Gσ. The operation by reversing the orientations
of all arcs incident with v and preserving the orientations of all its other arcs is called a reversal of

16

Gσ at v. Denote by S(Gσ) and S(Gβ) the skew adjacency matrices of the oriented graph Gσ and Gβ,
respectively. Let Gβ be a reversal of Gσ at v, then S(Gσ) = P S(Gβ)P −1. Hence

εs(Gσ) = εs(Gβ),

where P is the diagonal matrix obtained from the identity matrix In by replacing the diagonal entry
corresponding to vertices v by −1.

We will determine all connected 5-regular optimum skew energy oriented graphs as follow.

Theorem 3.4. Let Gσ be a connected 5-regular optimum skew energy oriented graph of order n. Then
Gσ is one of graphs with even neighborhood property depicted in Figure 4.

Proof. In the following, we will prove three classes of graphs (I), (II) and (XI) (see the end of Section
2) have no optimum orientations, and the other classes of graphs have optimum orientations.
Each graph in the classes (V), (VI), (IX), (XII), and (XIII) has an optimum orientation.
For G14, G15, G18, G23, G25, G28 and G29, from [3] and [7], we know Un, (n ≥ 3), P2✷K4, Q4
3 (Fig. 3.4 in [3]) have optimum orientations, respectively. By Lemma 3.2, we obtain G14 ∼=
and Gσ
P2✷(P2✷K4), G15 ∼= P2✷U3, G18 ∼= P2✷U4, G23 ∼= P2✷U5, G25 ∼= P2✷Un, G28 ∼= P2✷G3 (G3
of Fig. 3.4. in [3]), and G29 ∼= P2✷Q4 have optimum orientations, respectively.

Only graph G4 of class (III) has an optimum orientation.
For the graph G6 with order n ≥ 8. we will prove that G6 has an optimum orientation only when

n = 8.

Let {(v1, v2), (v1, vn−1), (v1, vn), (v1, v3), (v1, v4)} ⊂ E(Gσ

v2, v3, v4, vn−1 or vn if necessary).
