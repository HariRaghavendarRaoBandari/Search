On the coupling of regularization techniques
and the boundary element method for a
hemivariational inequality modelling a
delamination problem

N. Ovcharova

In this paper, we couple regularization techniques of nondiﬀerentiable optimization with the h-version of the boundary

element method (h-BEM) to solve nonsmooth variational problems arising in contact mechanics. As a model example we

consider the delamination problem. The variational formulation of this problem leads to a hemivariational inequality (HVI)

with a nonsmooth functional deﬁned on the contact boundary. This problem is ﬁrst regularized and then discretized by a

h-BEM. We prove convergence of the h-BEM Galerkin solution of the regularized problem in the energy norm, provide an
a-priori error estimate and give a numerical example. Copyright c(cid:13) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

1. Introduction

Eﬃcient numerical methods for simulation of mechanical problems with nonsmooth nonmonotone contact like the adhesive

contact in composite structure is of ever increasing importance in the last years. We are motivated by the delamination problems

in material sciences that come from the double cantilever beam (DCB) test problem [42]. The result of a typical experiment is

shown in Figure 1 from [42], where three probes with diﬀerent levels of contamination of the interface layer have been exposed.

Such problems lead in their mathematical formulation to boundary value problems involving nonmonotone and multivalued

laws which can be expressed by means of the Clarke subdiﬀerential of a nonconvex, nonsmooth locally Lipschitz function. As

a result, a nonsmooth functional deﬁned on the contact part appears in the variational formulation of these problems. The

nonsmooth behaviour in the adhesive is then modelled by a hemivariational inequality. There are several approaches to treat

this non-diﬀerentiability. We can combine a regularization of the nonsmooth functional with ﬁnite element methods (FEM), see

the PhD Thesis [36], or ﬁrst discretize by ﬁnite elements and then solve by nonsmooth optimization methods, see [15]. Note

that in both cases, we use approximation by ﬁnite elements. Another option to treat the adhesive problem numerically is the

boundary element method. To this end, the contact problem with adhesion has to be recast into a boundary integral formulation

by making use of the Poincar´e-Steklov operator. We emphasize that the behaviour of the adhesive interlayer is diﬀerent from the

contact behaviour in Signorini problems and contact problems with monotone friction. Similar to the Coulomb friction problem,

which has been treated in [14], the variational formulation of such problems includes a nondiﬀerentiable functional and leads to

a nonconvex problem. For mathematical background of contact paroblems in continuum mechanics and overview of numerical

solution methods, see [16, 17, 27]. Convergence analysis and numerical solution of Signorini and friction problems by the pure

h-boundary element Galerkin method have been discussed in [20, 23]. An advanced adaptive hp-version of BEM for unilateral

Signorini problems has been analyzed in [32]. In [7, 8] new approaches based on a high-oder hp-BEM and a FEM-BEM coupling

have been developed and applied to provide numerical benchmark computations for contact problems with friction. For further

numerical simulations in 2D-elasticity, we refer the reader to [5, 11, 33]. Multivalued boundary integral equations modelling

static and dynamic contact problems have been derived and studied in [1]. The ﬁrst paper that solves HVIs modelling adhesion

problems is due to Nesemann and Stephan [35]. They investigate existence and uniqueness, and also propose a residual error

estimator. As an exemplary function for the adhesion law they use a multivalued function with two jags. We note that their

approach is based on the minimization of the potential energy function after discretization via boundary element methods with

low polynomial degrees, and uses in the computations the Bundle-Newton mehod by Lukˇsan and Vlˇcek [31].

In this paper, we focus on a contact problem with adhesive bonding and present a novel approach to solve this problem

numerically, namely, we combine regularization techniques with the h-BEM. More precisely, after ε-regularization of the

nonsmooth functional, the resulting regularized problem is discretized by boundary elements. The discrete ﬁnite-dimensional

variational inequalities can be solved by means of numerical methods based on the optimization approach. In particular, we use

an appropriate merit function to recast them into an unconstrained global minimization problem. We also state conditions for

the uniqueness of the solution and establish εh-norm convergence of the discrete solution in the energy norm. For the Galerkin

solution of the regularized problem we provide an a-priori error estimate based on a novel C´ea-Falk approximation lemma. The

proposed approximation scheme is ﬁnally illustrated by a numerical example. Our benchmark example uses a serrated exemplary

adhesion law with several jags.

2. A nonmonotone boundary value problem from delamination

Let Ω ⊂ IRd (d = 2, 3) be a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary ∂Ω. We assume that the boundary is decomposed into
three open disjoint parts ΓD, ΓN , and ΓC such that ∂Ω = ΓD ∪ ΓN ∪ ΓC and, moreover, the measures of ΓC and ΓD are positive.
We consider an elastic body occupying Ω. The body is subject to volume force f ∈ (L2(Ω))d . Zero displacements are prescribed
on ΓD, surface tractions t ∈ (L2(ΓN ))d act on ΓN , and on the part ΓC a nonmonotone, generally multivalued boundary condition
2 (∇u + ∇uT ) denotes the linearized strain tensor and σ(u) = C : (u) stands for the stress tensor, where
holds. Further, (u) = 1
C is the Hooke tensor, assumed to be uniformly positive deﬁnite with L∞ coeﬃcients. The boundary stress vector can be further

where n denotes the unit outer normal vector on ∂Ω. Our benchmark problem is a two- or three-dimensional symmetric laminated

structure with an interlayer adhesive under loading. Because of the symmetry of the structure and by assuming that the forces

applied to the upper and lower part of the structure are the same, it suﬃces to consider only the upper half of the specimen

represented by Ω, see Figure 2 left for the 2D benchmark problem. The delamination problem under consideration is the following.

The contact law (2), written as a diﬀerential inclusion by means of the Clarke subdiﬀerential ∂f [9] of a locally Lipschitz function

f , describes the nonmonotone, multivalued behaviour of the adhesive. More precisely, ∂f is the physical law between the normal
component σn of the boundary stress vector and the normal component un = u · n of the displacement u on ΓC. A typical
zig-zagged nonmonotone adhesion law is shown in Figure 3. To give a variational formulation of the above boundary value

3. Boundary integral operator formulation

In this section using the Poincar´e-Steklov operator we rewrite the domain HVI (3) as a hemivariational inequality deﬁned only
on the boundary. To this end, we introduce Γ = ∂ Ω and Γ0 = Γ\ΓD = ΓN ∪ ΓC and deﬁne the Sobolev spaces [25]:

H1/2(Γ) = {v ∈ L2(Γ) : ∃v (cid:48) ∈ H1(Ω), tr v (cid:48) = v},
H1/2(Γ0) = {v = v (cid:48)|Γ0 : ∃v (cid:48) ∈ H1/2(Γ)},
˜H1/2(Γ0) = {v = v (cid:48)|Γ0 : v (cid:48) ∈ H1/2(Γ) : supp v (cid:48) ⊂ Γ0}

with the standard norms

where u0 is the extension of u by zero outside Γ0.

The Sobolev space of negative order on Γ0 are deﬁned by

Moreover, from [25, Lemma 4.3.1] we have the inclusions

˜H1/2(Γ0) ⊂ H1/2(Γ0) ⊂ L2(Γ0) ⊂ ˜H

−1/2(Γ0) ⊂ H

−1/2(Γ0).

For the spaces of vector-valued functions we use the bold symbols, e.g.

H1/2(Γ) = [H1/2(Γ)]d .

We consider now the Navier-Lam´e equation in IRd , d = 2, 3,

with the Hooke’s law of elasticity

−div σ(u) = f

σ(u) = 2µε(u) + λ div u · I.

Here, I is the d × d identity matrix, and λ, µ > 0 are the Lam´e constants depending on the material parameters:

are well-deﬁned and continuous for |σ| ≤ 1
. Moreover, V is symmetric and positive deﬁnite (elliptic on H−1/2(Γ)) in IR3 and, if
2
the capacity of Γ is smaller than 1, also in IR2. This can be always arranged by scaling, since the capacity (or conformal radius
or transﬁnite diameter) of Γ is smaller than 1, if Ω is contained in a disc with radius < 1 (see e.g. [40, 41]). The operator W
is symmetric and positive semideﬁnite with kernel IR (elliptic on ˜H1/2(Γ0)). Hence, since V is invertible, we obtain by taking the
Schur complement of the Calder´on projector that

Tx u = P u − Nf,

where P and N are the symmetric Poincar´e-Steklov operator and the Newton potential given, resepectively, by

If f = 0, P maps u to its traction and, therefore, the Poincar´e-Steklov operator is sometimes called the Dirichlet-to-Neumann
mapping. Moreover, the operator P induces a symmetric bilinear form on H1/2(Γ), and is continuous and ˜H1/2(Γ0)-elliptic, i.e.
there exist constants cP , CP > 0 such that

(cid:107)P u(cid:107)H−1/2(Γ) ≤ CP(cid:107)u(cid:107)H1/2(Γ)
(cid:104)P u, u(cid:105) ≥ cP(cid:107)u(cid:107) ˜H1/2(Γ0)

∀u ∈ H1/2(Γ),
∀u ∈ ˜H1/2(Γ0).

Here, (cid:104)·, ·(cid:105) is the duality pairing between the involved spaces. For the proof in 2D-case see e.g. [5].

To simplify the notations, we introduce

V = ˜H1/2(Γ0), KΓ = {v ∈ V : v|ΓC · n ≤ 0}.

Multiplying P u = σ(u)n by v − u, integrate on Γ0, and using thereby again the decomposition of σ(u)n on ΓC into the tangential
and the normal part, we get the boundary hemivariational inequality (Problem (P)): Find u ∈ KΓ such that

(P u) · (v − u)ds +

f 0(un(s); vn(s) − un(s))ds ≥

Nf · (v − u)ds +

t · (v − u)ds,

∀v ∈ KΓ.

The equivalence of (6) to its corresponding domain hemivariaional problem (3) should be understood in the following sence. If u
is a solution of (3), then the trace u|Γ is a solution of the boundary hemivariational inequality (6). Vice versa, if u is a solution
of (6) on Γ, then the extension of u onto Ω deﬁned by the Somigliana’s identity (5) with Tx u = P u − Nf is a solution of (3).
The same holds for the corresponding regularized problem deﬁned in the next section.

Finally, we note that the existence of a solution to problem (3), resp. (6), relies on the pseudomonotonicity of the nonsmooth
boundary functional and has been investigated in [21, 36, 37]. We recall that the functional ϕ : X × X → IR, where X is a real
n→∞ ϕ(un, u) ≥ 0 imply lim supn→∞ ϕ(un, v ) ≤ ϕ(u, v )
reﬂexive Banach space, is pseudomonotone if un (cid:42) u (weakly ) in X and lim inf
for all v ∈ X.

4. Regularization of the nonsmooth functional

In this section, we recall from [36, 37] a class of smoothing approximations for the maximum function based on smoothing
functions for the plus function p(t) = t + = max{t, 0} and state some tools that will be used throughout this paper.

We introduce the notations

IR+ = {ε ∈ IR : ε ≥ 0},

IR++ = {ε ∈ IR : ε > 0}.

κ =

|t| ρ(t) dt < ∞.

In general, the function ˆf is not easily applicable in practice, but for a special class of functions that can be expressed by means
of the plus function, it can be explicitly computed. For example, if f (x) = max{g1(x), g2(x)}, then

IRm

f (x) = g1(x) + p[g2(x) − g1(x)],

Replacing p(t) by its approximation P (ε, t) via convulation, we get S : IR++ × IR → IR,

S(ε, x ) = g1(x) + P (ε, g2(x) − g1(x)),

as a smoothing function of f .

Further, the representation formula (8) can be extended to the maximum function f : IR → IR of m continuous functions

g1, . . . , gm, i.e.

f (x) = max{g1(x), g2(x), . . . , gm(x)}.

The smoothing function S : IR++ × IR → R is then given by

S(ε, x ) = g1(x) + P (ε, g2(x) − g1(x) + . . . + P (ε, gm(x) − gm−1(x))) .

The major properties of the function S(·, ·) in (11) are listed in the following lemma:

Lemma 4.2 It holds that

|Sx (ε, x ) z| ≤ c(1 + |x|) |z| ∀x, z ∈ IR

Jε(u) =

Since S is continuously diﬀerentiable, the functional Jε is everywhere Gˆateaux diﬀerentiable with continuous Gˆateaux derivative
DJε : V → V ∗ given by

(cid:104)DJε(u), v(cid:105)ΓC =

Sx (ε, un(s))vn(s) ds.

The regularized domain problem of (3) and the corresponding regularized boundary problem of (6) are now deﬁned, respectively,
by: Find uε ∈ K such that

a(uε, v − uε) + (cid:104)DJε(uε), v − uε(cid:105)ΓC ≥

subsequence of solutions {uεk}, εk → 0+, which converges strongly in H1(Ω) to a solution of the problem (3). Because of the
equivalence of the boundary variational formulations (6) and (17) to their corresponding domain variational problems (3) and

(16), we can formulate the following result.

Theorem 4.1 The regularized boundary problem (17) has at least one solution uε ∈ KΓ. The family {uε} is uniformly bounded in
V. Moreover, there exists a subnet of {uε} which converges strongly in H1/2(Γ) to a solution u of the boundary hemivariational
inequality (6).

5. Uniqueness Result

In this section, we give a new abstract uniqueness criteria for the solution of the boundary hemivariational inequality. Whereas

the uniqueness result of Nesemann and Stephan [35] is limited to the concrete context, our result exhibits the functional analytic

structure. Moreover, we elaborate an example of a locally Lipschitz function that shows how the abstract uniqueness condition

can be guaranteed.

To shorten the notations we introduce the functional ϕ : H1/2(Γ) × H1/2(Γ) → IR,

(18)

(19)

and the linear form

ϕ(u, v) =

(cid:104)g, v(cid:105) =

We assume that there exists a constant α ∈ [0, cP ) such that for any u, v ∈ V it holds

ϕ(u, v) + ϕ(v, u) ≤ α(cid:107)u − v(cid:107)2V .

We have now the following abstract uniqueness result.

Theorem 5.1 Under the assumption (19), there exists a unique solution of problem (P), which depends Lipschitz continuously
on g ∈ V∗.

Proof Assume that u, ˜u are two solutions of (P). Then the inequalities below hold:

(cid:104)P u − g, v − u(cid:105)Γ0 + ϕ(u, v) ≥ 0 ∀v ∈ KΓ,

(cid:104)P ˜u − g, v − ˜u(cid:105)Γ0 + ϕ(˜u, v) ≥ 0 ∀v ∈ KΓ.

Setting v = ˜u in the ﬁrst inequality and v = u in the second one, and summing up the resulting inequalities, we get

(cid:104)P u − P ˜u, ˜u − u(cid:105)Γ0 + ϕ(u, ˜u) + ϕ(˜u, u) ≥ 0.

(20)

We next use the coercivity of the operator P and the assumption (19) to obtain

cP(cid:107)u − ˜u(cid:107)2V ≤ ϕ(u, ˜u) + ϕ(˜u, u) ≤ α(cid:107)u − ˜u(cid:107)2V .

Hence, since α ∈ [0, cP ), if u (cid:54)= ˜u we receive a contradiction.

Let now gi ∈ V∗ and denote ui = ugi , i = 1, 2. Analogously to (20), we ﬁnd that

Hence,

and by (19),

(cid:104)P u1 − g1 − P u2 + g2, u2 − u1(cid:105)Γ0 + ϕ(u1, u2) + ϕ(u2, u1) ≥ 0.

cP(cid:107)u1 − u2(cid:107)2V ≤ ϕ(u1, u2) + ϕ(u2, u1) + (cid:104)g1 − g2, u2 − u1(cid:105)

(cP − α)(cid:107)u1 − u2(cid:107)2V ≤ (cid:104)g1 − g2, u2 − u1(cid:105) ≤ (cid:107)g1 − g2(cid:107)V∗(cid:107)u1 − u2(cid:107)V .

which concludes the proof of the theorem.

Further, we present a class of locally Lipschitz functions for which (19) is satisﬁed. We assume the following so-called one-sided

Lipschitz condition on ∂f . Let f : IR → IR be a function such that

∗ ∈ ∂f (ξ), ∀η

Hence, (19) is satisﬁed provided that α ≥ 0 is suﬃciently small (α < cP ).

Remark 5.1 If S(ε, ·) : IR → IR satisﬁes (21), i.e. there exists a constant α ≥ 0 such that

(Sx (ε, x1) − Sx (ε, x2))(x1 − x2) ≥ −α|x1 − x2|2 ∀x1, x2 ∈ IR,

(22)

then the regularized problem (Pε) is unique solvable provided that α < cp.

We ﬁnish this section with a simple example for a locally Lipschitz function f , for which (21) holds.

Example 5.1 Let the graph g of ∂f consists of several decreasing straight line segments with negative slopes −αi , i = 1, . . . , I,
and nonnegative jumps (see Figure 4), i.e.

∂f (x) =(cid:2)g(x), g(x)(cid:3) ,

6. Discretization with boundary elements

Let Ω ⊂ IRd , d = 2, 3, be a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary Γ. As already mentioned, we only need a mesh on the
boundary. The elements of this mesh are edges in 2D-case and triangles in 3D-case.

For the discretization of the displacement u we use continuous piecewise linear functions on a triangulation Th on Γ, which is

consistent with the decomposition of Γ into Γ0 and ΓD and deﬁne

Vh = {vh ∈ C(Γ) : vh|E ∈ [IP1(E)]d−1 ∀E ∈ Th, vh = 0 on ΓD} ⊂ H1/2

D (Γ),

h = {vh ∈ Vh : (vh · n)(Pi ) ≤ 0 ∀Pi ∈ Σh, Pi ∈ ΓC\ΓD},
KΓ
where Σh is the set of all nodes of Th.

To approximate the stresses we take as ansatz space the space of piecewise constant functions on Th:

Wh = {ψ ∈ L2(Γ) : ψ|E ∈ [IP0(E)]d−1 ∀E ∈ Th} ⊂ H

−1/2(Γ).

For more details on the approximation techniques based on boundary element method see e.g. [6, 10, 11, 20, 22, 23, 32, 33, 40].

Let {ϕi}ND

i=1 and {ψj}NN

j=1 be the bases in Vh and Wh, respectively. Then the boundary matrices are given by

(Vh)i,j = (cid:104)V ψi , ψj(cid:105),
(Wh)i,j = (cid:104)W φi , φj(cid:105),

(Kh)i,j = (cid:104)Kφi , ψj(cid:105),
(Ihp)i,j = (cid:104)φi , ψj(cid:105)

The matrix Vh is symmetric and positive deﬁnite, so it can be inverted by a Cholesky decomposition and as a approximation of

the Galerkin matrix we obtain the matrix

(23)

Steklov operator P , by

The following statements hold:

Lemma 6.1

(i) If uh (cid:42) u (weak convergence) and vh → v in H1/2(Γ). Then, lim
h→0

(cid:104)Phuh, vh(cid:105) = (cid:104)P u, v(cid:105).

(ii) If uh → u and vh (cid:42) v in H1/2(Γ). Then, lim
h→0

(cid:104)Phuh, vh(cid:105) = (cid:104)P u, v(cid:105).

Proof: The part (i) follows immediately from the estimate below. Indeed, from [4, Lemma 9], there exists a constant c0 such

that

(cid:104)Phvh − i

h P v, wh(cid:105)Vh ≤ c0(cid:107)wh(cid:107)H1/2(Γ)
∗

eh(v) + (cid:107)vh − v(cid:107)H1/2(Γ)

for any v ∈ H1/2(Γ) and for any vh, wh ∈ Vh, where eh(v) satisﬁes eh(v) → 0 as h → 0.

Hence, using the symmetry of P and Ph, we obtain

(cid:104)Phuh, vh(cid:105) − (cid:104)P u, v(cid:105) = (cid:104)Phvh − i

h P v, uh(cid:105) + (cid:104)P v, ihuh − u(cid:105)
∗

≤ c0(cid:107)uh(cid:107)H1/2(Γ)

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

+ (cid:104)P v, uh − u(cid:105)

and thus, (i) is satisﬁes. The proof of (ii) follows in the same way.

From now on, let Ω be a bounded domain in IR2 with a polygonal boundary Γ. We deﬁne Π : H1/2(Γ) → L2(ΓC) by

Πuh = uh · n on ΓC.

Further, let {Γj}J

n is piecewise constant with a discontinuity at the vertices of Ω.
Let {Pi}m

From Glowinski et al. [17], we know that

and therefore,

(cid:107)Lh(vh · n)(cid:107)L2(Γ) ≤ 2 (cid:107)vh · n(cid:107)L2(Γ)

(cid:107)vh · n − Lh(vh · n)(cid:107)L2(Γ) ≤ 3 (cid:107)vh · n(cid:107)L2(Γ).

Let now Hs (Γj ), s ≥ 0, be the standard Sobolev space from [18, 19, 30] deﬁned on the open straight pieces Γj by

According to Grisvard [18, 19], Hs (Γ) ⊂ J(cid:89)

Again from Glowinski et al. [17],

Hs (Γj ) = {u|Γj

L2(Γj ) ≤ Ch2(cid:107)vh · n(cid:107)2

H1(Γj ) ≤ Ch2(cid:107)vh(cid:107)2

H1(Γj ).

Summing over all j and using thereafter (30), it follows that

(cid:107)vh · n − Lh(vh · n)(cid:107)L2(Γ) ≤ Ch(cid:107)vh(cid:107)H1(Γ).

By interpolation between L2(Γ) and H1(Γ) we deduce from (29) and (32) that

By the compactness of Hs1 (Γ) ⊂ Hs2 (Γ) for 0 ≤ s2 ≤ s1 (Ω ⊂ IR2), this gives

(cid:107)vh · n − Lh(vh · n)(cid:107)L2(Γ) ≤ Ch1/2(cid:107)vh(cid:107)H1/2(Γ).

The solvability of (Pε,h) and the convergence of its solutions to a solution of the boundary hemivariational inequality (6) relies

on the following general approximation result from [21].

Let K be a closed convex nonvoid subset of a reﬂexive Banach space X. We consider the variational inequality V I(ψ, f , K):

Find u ∈ K such that

ψ(u, v ) ≥ (cid:104)f , v − u(cid:105) ∀v ∈ K.

Let T be a directed set. We introduce the family {Kt}t∈T of nonempty, closed and convex sets Kt (not necessary contained in
K) and assume the following hypotheses:

(H1) If {vt(cid:48)}t(cid:48)∈T (cid:48) weakly converges to v in X, vt(cid:48) ∈ Kt(cid:48) (t(cid:48) ∈ T (cid:48)) for a subnet {Kt(cid:48)}t(cid:48)∈T (cid:48) of the net {Kt}t∈T , then v ∈ K.

(H6) There exist constants c > 0, d, d0 ∈ IR and α > 1 (independent of t ∈ T ) such that for some wt ∈ Kt with wt → w

Theorem 6.1 [37] (General approximation result) Under the hypotheses (H1)-(H6), there exist a solution ut to the approximate
problem V I(ψt , ft , Kt ) and the family {ut} is bounded in X. Moreover, there exists a subnet of {ut} that converges weakly in
X to a solution of the problem V I(ψ, f , K). Furthermore, any weak accumulation point of {ut} is a solution to the problem
V I(ψ, f , K).

Remark 6.1 The hypotheses (H1) and (H2) are due to Glowinski [16] and describe the Mosco convergence [2] of the family
Kt to K. If we replace the weak convergence in (H1) by the strong convergence, we obtain the classical Painlev´e-Kuratowski
convergence [3] based on the notions of upper and lower limits of a net of sets. As already mentioned, the pseudomonotonicity of

ψt in (H3) guarantees a solution to the discrete problem, whereas ft in (H4) is a standard approximation of the linear functional

f , for example, by numerical integration. The veriﬁcation of (H5) and (H6) is based on the arguments used in [36], where the

discretization of the domain hemivariational problem has been investigated. For self-consistency of the paper we include them

below.

Veriﬁcation of (H5) Let

with hn → 0 and εn → 0+. We deﬁne

uεn ,hn (cid:42) u,

vεn ,hn → v

in H1/2(Γ)

wεn ,hn = Lhn (Π(vεn ,hn − uεn ,hn )).

Since vεn ,hn − uεn ,hn (cid:42) v − u =: w in H1/2(Γ), it follows by (34) that

wεn ,hn → w · n = Πw in L2(Γ)

as n → ∞.

By (34), Lhn (Πuεn ,hn ) → Πu in L2(ΓC) and thus, for a subsequence, Lhn (Πuεn ,hn )(s) → Πu(s) for a.e. s ∈ ΓC. Moreover, there
exists a function h ∈ L2(ΓC; IR+) such that |Lhn (Πuεn ,hn )(s)| ≤ h(s) for a.e. s ∈ ΓC.

The last integrand in (36) is uniformly bounded from above, since by (15a),

|Sx (Lhn (εn, Πuεn ,hn )(s)) Πw(s)| ≤ c(1 + |Lhn (Πuεn ,hn )(s)|)|Πw(s)| ≤ c(1 + h(s))|Πw(s)|.

Moreover, applying (a + b)2 ≤ 2(a2 + b2) to the right-hand side of (15a) and integrating over ΓC implies

|Sx (εn, Lhn (εn, Πuεn ,hn ))|2 ds ≤ 2c 2 meas (ΓC) + 2c 2 (cid:107)Lhn (εn, Πuεn ,hn )(cid:107)2

where we have used (38), the strong convergence (35) as well as the boundedness of {Sx (Lhn (Πuεn ,hn ), εn)} in L2(ΓC) (see
(37)). Thus, the hypothesis (H5) is veriﬁed for t = (εn, hn).

Veriﬁcation of (H6) The hypothesis (H6) is obviously satisﬁed, since by (27) there exists a constant C > 0, which does not

depend on ε and h, such that

(cid:104)DJεn ,hn (uεn ,hn ), −uεn ,hn(cid:105)ΓC ≤ C(cid:107)uεn ,hn(cid:107)H1/2(Γ).

For the convenience of the reader, we next show the uniform boundedness of {uε,h} in ˜H1/2(Γ0).

Lemma 6.2 The family {uε,h} of solutions of the problem (Pε,h) is uniformly bounded in ˜H1/2(Γ0).

Proof Putting vh = 0 in (25), using (23) and the estimate (27), we get

c(cid:107)uε,h(cid:107)2V ≤ (cid:104)Phuε,h, uε,h(cid:105)Γ0 ≤ (cid:104)g, uε,h(cid:105) + (cid:104)DJε,h(uε,h), −uε,h(cid:105)ΓC ≤ (cid:107)g(cid:107)V∗ (cid:107)uε,h(cid:107)V + c(cid:107)uε,h(cid:107)V ,

which implies the uniform boundedness of {uε,h} in V with respect to the both parameters ε and h.

Further, in case of uniqueness we improve the convergence result of Theorem 6.1 and show that the weak convergence can be

replaced by the strong one.

Theorem 6.2 Let the solutions u to (P) and uε,h to (Pε,h) exist uniquely. Then

lim

ε→0,h→0

(cid:107)uε,h − u(cid:107) ˜H1/2(Γ0) = 0.

Proof of Theorem 6.2 Let {hn} and {εn} be arbitrary sequences such that hn → 0+ and εn → 0+ as n → ∞. In view of (ii),
there exists a sequence {¯uεn ,hn} such that ¯uεn ,hn ∈ KΓ

hn and ¯uεn ,hn → u in V.

Using (23), we obtain

c(cid:107)¯uεn ,hn − uεn ,hn(cid:107)2V ≤ (cid:104)Ph(¯uεn ,hn − uεn ,hn ), ¯uεn ,hn − uεn ,hn(cid:105)Γ0

= (cid:104)Ph¯uεn ,hn , ¯uεn ,hn − uεn ,hn(cid:105)Γ0 − (cid:104)Phuεn ,hn , ¯uεn ,hn − uεn ,hn(cid:105)Γ0 .

(39)

Since ¯uεn ,hn → u in V and uεn ,hn (cid:42) u in V, it follows from Lemma 6.1 (ii) that the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of (39)
tends to zero.

Using the deﬁnition of (Pεn ,hn ), inequality (25), the second term can be estimated as follows:

|(cid:104)Phuεn ,hn , uεn ,hn − ¯uεn ,hn(cid:105)Γ0| ≤ |(cid:104)g, uεn ,hn − ¯uεn ,hn(cid:105)| + |(cid:104)DJεn ,hn (uεn ,hn ), ¯uεn ,hn − uεn ,hn(cid:105)ΓC|.

(40)

In addition, we have

|(cid:104)DJεn ,hn (uεn ,hn ), ¯un,hn − un,hn(cid:105)ΓC| =

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:90)

as follows from (37), the boundedness of {uεn ,hn} in ˜H1/2(Γ0) and (34).

Passing now to the limit superior in (40), we get

Hence, (39) entails in the limit, that

and therefore,

Finally, from the triangle inequality

we get the strong convergence of an appropriate subsequence of {uεn ,hn} to u in V.

7. A-priori error estimate

In this section we present an abstract C´ea-Falk approximation lemma for the regularized problem. For its proof we slightly extend

the arguments of Maischak and Stephan in [32] for Signorini contact to include the approximation of DJε by DJε,h. We apply
this lemma to obtain an a-priori error estimate for the h - approximate solution of the regularized problem assuming H3/2(Γ)
regularity of the solution uε. For our more general problem we arrive at the same convergence rate of O(h1/4) as in [32].

In addition we refer to Eck et al. [14]. They obtain a sharper error estimate for the approximation of the regularized solution of

the Coulomb friction problem. However, one should note that the treatment of the Coulomb friction involves the regularization

of the absolute value function only, whereas in the delamination problem we have to cope with multivalued laws and several

jumps.

Lemma 7.1 Let uε ∈ KΓ, uε,h ∈ KΓ
Then, there exists a positive constant C independent of ε and h such that

h be the solutions of the problems (Pε) and (Pε,h), respectively. Assume that P uε − g ∈ L2(Γ).

for all v ∈ KΓ and for all vh ∈ KΓ
h .

Proof The proof follows by the deﬁnitions of the problems (Pε) and (Pε,h), and by using estimates similar to (25)-(28) in [32,
Theorem 3].

Theorem 7.1 Let uε ∈ KΓ, uε,h ∈ KΓ
and P uε − g ∈ L2(Γ). Then, under the assumption (22), there exists a constant c = c(uε, g) independent of h such that

h be the solutions of the problems (Pε) and (Pε,h), respectively. Assume that uε ∈ H3/2(Γ)

(cid:107)uε − uε,h(cid:107)H1/2(Γ) ≤ ch1/4.

Proof We apply Lemma 7.1 with v = uε,h ∈ KΓ
C0(Γ). According to [32, Lemma 5], the ﬁrst term in (41) can be estimated by

h ⊂ KΓ and vh = ihuε ∈ KΓ

Further, by [32], proof of Theorem 3, there exists a constant c > 0 independent of h such that

(cid:107)uε − ihuε(cid:107)H1/2(Γ) ≤ ch(cid:107)uε(cid:107)H3/2(Γ).

Since the consistency error inf{. . . | v ∈ KΓ} disappears, to complete the proof it remains to estimate the last error term in
(41). For this purpose, using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and assumption (22) guaranteeing the uniqueness of the solution,

we proceed in the following way:

L2(ΓC ).

First, by (15a), we have

and due to (33),

(cid:107)Sx (ε, Πuε)(cid:107)L2(ΓC ) ≤ c(1 + (cid:107)Πuε(cid:107)L2(ΓC ))

(cid:107)Πuε,h − Lh(Πuε,h) (cid:107)L2(ΓC ) ≤ ch1/2(cid:107)uε,h(cid:107)H1/2(ΓC ).

Then, by the triangle inequality, and using the estimates (33) and (43), we have

(cid:107)Lh(Πihuε) − Πuε(cid:107)L2(ΓC ) ≤ (cid:107)Lh(Πihuε) − Πihuε(cid:107)L2(ΓC ) + (cid:107)Πihuε − Πuε(cid:107)L2(ΓC ) ≤ c1h1/2(cid:107)ihuε(cid:107)H1/2(ΓC ) + c2(cid:107)ihuε − uε(cid:107)H1/2(ΓC )

≤ c1h1/2(cid:16)

ch(cid:107)uε(cid:107)H3/2(ΓC ) + (cid:107)uε(cid:107)H1/2(ΓC )

+ ˜c2h(cid:107)uε(cid:107)H3/2(ΓC ).

(cid:17)

Analogously,

(cid:107)Lh(Πuε,h) − Πuε(cid:107)2

L2(ΓC ) ≤ 2(cid:107)Lh(Πuε,h) − Πuε,h(cid:107)2

L2(ΓC ) + 2(cid:107)Πuε,h − Πuε(cid:107)2

L2(ΓC ) ≤ ˜c3h(cid:107)uε,h(cid:107)2

H1/2(ΓC ) + ˜c4(cid:107)uε − uε,h(cid:107)2

H1/2(ΓC ).

Therefore, we have

D ≤ c1h1/2(1 + (cid:107)uε(cid:107)H1/2(ΓC ))(cid:107)uε,h(cid:107)H1/2(ΓC ) + c2(1 + (cid:107)uε,h(cid:107)H1/2(ΓC ))(c3h3/2(cid:107)uε(cid:107)H3/2(ΓC ) + c4h(cid:107)uε(cid:107)H3/2(ΓC ) + c5h1/2(cid:107)uε(cid:107)H1/2(ΓC ))

+ α˜c3h(cid:107)uε,h(cid:107)2

H1/2(ΓC ) + α˜c4(cid:107)uε − uε,h(cid:107)2

H1/2(ΓC ).

Hence, taking into account the uniform boundedness of {(cid:107)uε,h(cid:107) ˜H1/2(Γ0)}, we conclude that there exists a constant c = c(uε) such

that

D ≤ ch1/2 + α˜c2(cid:107)uε − uε,h(cid:107)2

H1/2(Γ).

Altogether yields the claimed estimate of the error (cid:107)uε,h − uε(cid:107)H1/2(Γ) provided that α in (22) is small enough.

8. Numerical experiments

For the numerical experiments, we choose Ω = (0, 100) × (0, 10) in [mm]. The boundary is divided into three parts ΓD =
{0} × [0, 10], ΓC = (0, 100] × {0} and ΓN = ∂Ω\(ΓD ∪ ΓC). The two-dimensional example can be treated as an approximation
for a three-dimensional case considering the domain Ω as the cross section of a three-dimensional
linear elastic body. The
material parameters are E = 210 GPa and ν = 0.3. The applied loads on [50, 100] × {10} are (0, t2) with t2 = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6,

All computations use piecewise linear functions on a uniform grid with 160 nodes. The number of the unknowns in the discrete
regularized boundary problem (25) is 166 (40 nodes on ΓC\ΓD and 43 nodes on ΓN ). The regularization parameter ε is set to
ε = 0.1. This choice of ε is based on the observation that smaller values do not improve the solution from a mechanics point of

view. The smoothing approximation of the minimum superpotential (44) can be handled as above and is based on the smoothing

function (9). The discrete regularized problem (25) is solved using the following steps. Firstly, we rewrite (25) as a mixed
√
a2 + b2 − (a + b) we reformulate the
complementarity problem. Secondly, by using the Fischer-Burmeister function f (a, b) =
last problem as a system of nonlinear equations of the form F (·) = 0. Finally, by using 1
2(cid:107)F (·)(cid:107)2 as a merit function, we obtain
a smooth unconstrained minimization problem, which is solved by the lsqnonlin MATLAB function based on the trust-region

Newton method. For details, we refer the reader to [36]. The maximal number of iterations in lsqnonlin has been ﬁxed to 100.

The numerical results are plotted on Figures 7 and 8. They illustrate the computed vertical displacements and the normal

component σn of the boundary stress vector along ΓC. One can see that the computed normal stresses on ΓC reﬂect the adhesion

law from Figure 6.

Conclusions

In this paper, we have presented a novel approximation method for solving hemivariational inequalities. This method is based on

a smooth approximation of the nonsmooth functional and then, discretization by h-BEM. As a future work, we can combine the

the regularization techniques with hp-adaptive BEM to improve the convergence rates of the discretization based on appropriate

and automated mesh reﬁnements (h-adaptivity) and raising of the polynomial degree (p-adaptivity). Another interesting direction
