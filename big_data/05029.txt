By modelling heat engines as driven multi-partite system we show that their dissipation can be
expressed in terms of the lag (relative entropy) between the perturbed state of each partition and
their equilibrium state, and the correlations that build up among the partitions. We illustrate the
rich interplay between correlations and lags with a two-qubit device driven by a quantum gate.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum thermodynamics, the discipline that stud-
ies the impact of the laws of quantum mechanics on
the transduction of work into heat (and vice-versa) in
the microscopic domain, is currently undergoing a fast
and intense development [1–6]. One of its main objec-
tives concerns the understanding of quantum thermal
machines: Their underlying functionalities, mode of op-
eration, bounds that limit their performance, as well as
the conception and experimental realisation thereof.

Among the recent advancements in the ﬁeld of non-
equilibrium (classical and quantum) thermodynamics [7,
8], the ﬂuctuation relation for heat engines [9–11] estab-
lishes the microscopic conditions under which a generic
heat engine cannot have an eﬃciency overcoming the
Carnot eﬃciency.
In its essence a heat engine can be
imagined composed by a working substance and two (or
more) thermal reservoirs. The whole system can be mod-
elled as a driven multi-partite system starting in a fac-
torised state [10, 11]

Here Hi includes both the Hamiltonian of bath i, H B
i and
possibly the Hamiltonian H W S
of one sub-part (part i)
of the working substance (as well as their mutual inter-
actions), see Fig. 1, panel b (although we use a quan-
tum notation, the theory developed in this paper ap-
plies unaltered in classical mechanics). Machines achiev-
ing eﬃciencies larger than Carnot’s can be conceived.
This however can only happen when the above mod-
elling does not apply, e.g., when the initial state con-
tains non-factorisable correlation terms, coherences [12],
or if it contains non-thermal states, e.g., squeezed ther-
mal states [13].

Here we continue the investigation of heat engines
along the lines set in Refs. [10, 11] and study the sources
of dissipation in a heat engine by analysing the non-
equilibrium behaviour of a generic driven multi-partite
system.
In the case of a mono-partite system pre-
pared in a thermal state one of the cornerstones of mod-
ern non-equilibrium thermodynamics establishes that the

total dissipation during the driving can be quantiﬁed
by means of an information theoretic quantity, namely
the relative entropy D[ρt||ρeq
t ] = Tr(ρt ln ρt − ρt ln ρeq
t )
the time
between the oﬀ-equilibrium state ρt,
evolved of ρeq
t =
e−βH(λt)/Z(λt, β) [14–16]:

0 , and the corresponding equilibrium ρeq

i.e.

βWdiss = D[ρt||ρeq

Here, H(λt) is the systems Hamiltonian depending on a
time-dependent parameter λt, Wdiss = hW i − ∆F , is the
average dissipate work with hW i the average work and
∆F , the free energy diﬀerence between the initial state
ρeq
0 and the reference thermal state ρeq
t at time t. This
relation has been useful for analysing and understand-

Hi(t) denotes the time dependent Hamiltonian of sub-
system i, while V (t) denotes a time dependent coupling
among the subsystems. The driving consists in the tem-
poral sequence t between t = 0 and t = τ . The coupling
V is assumed to vanish for all times t /∈ (0, τ ), so that the
driving moves the Hamiltonian from H(0) = Pi Hi(0) to
H(τ ) = Pi Hi(τ ). Let us assume that at t = 0 each sub-
system is prepared in a thermal equilibrium at inverse
temperature βi and is uncorrelated from the other sub-
systems:

be the state of the full system and of each subsystem

ple [14, 17].

Here we generalise Eq. (2) to the case of a multipartite
system in contact with many baths. The corresponding
expression, our main result, reads

t||ρi,eq
D[ρi
] denotes the relative entropy between the re-
duced density matrix of part i, ρi
t, and its the reference
equilibrium state ρi,eq
. Most remarkably, besides the lags
D[ρi
], another term I[ρt] occurs in Eq. (3) which is
the total correlation among all the parts composing the
system, (that is the mutual information in the case of bi-
partite system). In a multipartite system there are two
sources of dissipation: The lag of each subsystem with re-
spect to its equilibrium and the correlation which builds
up among the parts. Eq.
(3) is illustrated in Fig. 1,
panel a). That correlation is a source of dissipation was
established previously in Ref. [18], which focussed on an
open system, starting in a generic state, and identiﬁed
entropy production with the system bath correlations.
The present work thus uniﬁes the result of Esposito et al
with Eq.(2).

In the speciﬁc case when the driven multi-partite sys-
tem is a heat engine working with N reservoirs at inverse
temperatures β1 ≤ β2 · · · ≤ βN , Eq. (3) implies

where δη = ηC /η − 1 is the relative deviation of the
heat engine’s eﬃciency from Carnot’s eﬃciency ηC =
1−β1/βN and Wout ≥ 0 is the heat engine’s output work.
Eq. (4) has far-reaching consequences for the microscopic
theory of heat engines (i) no quantum (nor classical) ther-
mal machine can overcome Carnot eﬃciency. This is a
consequence of the fact that the r.h.s of Eq. (4) is non-
negative. (ii) Carnot eﬃciency can only be reached at
zero work output. We shall detail both points below.

We further illustrate the main result of this work by
considering an experimentally feasible quantum engine
based on a double qubit, undergoing gate operations [11].
This example also helps shading light onto the question
of what is the role of correlations in quantum thermody-
namics, a topic of great current interest [19–21]. As we
shall see depending on whether one looks at eﬃciency or
work, correlations can be either an obstacle or a help.

DISSIPATION IN DRIVEN MULTI-PARTITE

SYSTEMS

Consider a driven multipartite system:

H(t) = H1(t) + H2(t) + . . . HN (t) + V (t)

(5)

Consider now the reference thermal equilibrium of sub-
system i corresponding to the value H(t) of its Hamilto-
nian

t =

(10)

This is the state that subsystem i would reach if at time t
one would turn oﬀ the coupling V , freeze the subsystem
Hamiltonian to H(t), weakly couple the system with a
thermal bath at temperature βi and let the system relax
to thermal equilibrium. Solving Eq. (10) for βiHi(t) and
plugging into (8) one ﬁnds

mann information ∆Si would be null. This happens if
the system consists of a single subsystem (i.e. if N = 1),

in which case one recovers the known result in (2). For
N > 1 however the evolution of each reduced density
matrix is evidently non-unitary, and this can in general
lead to non null von Neumann information changes ∆Si.

total correlation I[ρτ ] is non-negative: the system starts
in a factorised, i.e. uncorrelated state, and in the course
of time, the evolution can only increase the correlation.
The more the correlation established within the parts,
the more the total dissipation. [24]

APPLICATION TO HEAT ENGINES

Equation (3) has deep consequences in assessing the
performance of thermal machines (large and small alike,
classical or quantum). In this respect it is worth remark-
ing that the whole argument presented above can be re-
peated within the formalism of classical Hamiltonian me-
chanics, with density matrices replaced by Liouville den-
sities in phase space and traces replaced by phase space
integrals. The crucial assumption is that most thermal
machines can be understood as multi-partite systems ini-
tially staying in an uncorrelated product of N thermal
states at diﬀerent temperatures, and undergoing, as a
whole, a unitary process. Consider for example the text-
book Carnot engine. A device, which can range from a
macroscopic gas in a box to a single two level system, is
initially in thermal contact and equilibrium with a bath
at temperature T1, and is neither in contact nor corre-
lated with a second bath at temperature T2. The device
plus bath at T1 forms subsystem 1, with Hamiltonian
H1 initially staying at ρ1,eq
t = e−β1H1 /Z1. The bath at
temperature T2 forms subsystem 2 with Hamiltonian H2
and initially staying at ρ2,eq
= e−β2H2 /Z2. The initial
state of the bipartite system is the factorised state in
Eq. (6). Next a number of manipulations acting on the
system and on the coupling with the heat reservoirs, are
performed on the total Hamiltonian. This process ﬁts
within the general scheme presented above. In general
any other thermal machine that can be modelled as a
driven open system in operating between various ther-
mal baths can be modelled with our general scheme as
well.

For a heat engine that works in a cycle between N
reservoirs, the ﬁnal Hamiltonian H(τ ) coincides with the
initial Hamiltonian H(0). In this case Eq. (3) simpliﬁes
into:

(14)

τ − ρi,eq

0)[ρi

where h∆Eii = TriHi(λi
] is the energy that
remains stored in subsystem i after the driving is over.
Note that under the assumption that at the end of the
driving the working substance stores no energy or a negli-
gible amount thereof, and assuming all device-baths cou-
pling are weak, h∆Eii can be understood as the negative
heat −Qi that has gone in the bath i. Also the sum
Pih∆Eii quantiﬁes the total energy injected hW i into
the full system, i.e., the negative work output

hW i = X

h∆Eii = −Wout

(15)

i

Using Eqs. (14,15) and assuming the ordering βi ≤ βi+1,
(4) where δη = ηC /η − 1, with ηC =
we obtain Eq.
1 − β1/β2 the Carnot eﬃciency and η = hW i/h∆E1i =
Wout/(−Q1), the engine eﬃciency.
In the speciﬁc case
when N = 2, the inequality in (4) reduces to an equality

β2Woutδη = D[ρ1

(16)

Assuming that the machine operates as a heat engine
(i.e., with our sign conventions, Wout ≥ 0), since the
r.h.s. of Eq. (4) is non-negative it implies η ≤ ηC . That
is no heat engine can overcome the Carnot eﬃciency. A
similar conclusion can be drawn for refrigerators.

τ = ρi,eq

Eq.(4) has however much deeper and stronger impli-
cations. Can Carnot eﬃciency coexist with ﬁnite work
output? At Carnot eﬃciency the left hand side of Eq. (4)
is null. Since the right hand side is the sum of three non-
negative terms, each of them must vanish at Carnot eﬃ-
ciency. Recall that the relative entropy D[·||·] only van-
ishes when its two arguments are identical. This implies
that at Carnot eﬃciency ρi
. Hence h∆Eii = 0
and Pih∆Eii = hW i = 0. This implies a very strong re-
sult: Any machine working exactly at Carnot eﬃciency
delivers/absorbs no heat and no work. This seems to
contrast with the textbook knowledge that the Carnot
engine delivers a ﬁnite work (given by the non-null area
enclosed by the cycle in the S − T plane). To reconcile
these two apparently incompatible facts notice that we
have modelled the evolution of the engine as a global uni-
tary U that involves both working substance and baths,
and changes not only the state of the working substance
but that of the bath as well.
If you assume the latter
to have an inﬁnite heat capacity so as to be resilient to
the external action, as is implied in the textbook treat-
ment, the work is then indeed inﬁnitesimally small when
compared to the inﬁnite energy stored in the bath. In a
separate publication ?? we have addressed how one can

TWO-QUBIT ENGINE

We consider the experimentally feasible two-qubit en-
gine described in Ref.[11] and ﬁrst introduced in [22], see
Fig. 2. Two uncoupled qubits are prepared each in ther-
mal equilibrium with a distinct reservoir. Between time
t = 0 and t = τ the two qubits are coupled to each other
by means of coupling V (t) and the coupling with their
respective reservoirs is suﬃciently weak that we can as-
sume they evolve unitarily. Hence we can apply the the-
ory developed above to the small Hilbert space of the two
qubits, rather than the total qubits plus reservoirs. This
allows for a drastic simpliﬁcation. The Hamiltonian of
the two qubits reads:

H(t) = H1 + H2 + V (t) =

ω1
2

σ1
z +

ω2
2

σ2
z + V (t)

(17)

with σi
z the Pauli matrices. After the coupling is ap-
plied each qubit is in an out of equilibrium state, and is
then allowed to relax to thermal equilibrium with its own
thermal bath for a suﬃcient time τrelax so that the initial
state is restored and the cycle is completed. The energies
h∆Eii delivered to each qubit during the drive equal the
negative heat Qi ceded to their respective reservoir dur-
ing the relaxation step. It is known [11] that heat engine
operation is achieved for β1/β2 ≤ ω2/ω1 ≤ 1 irrespective
of the temperatures of the two reservoirs and that the
maximal eﬃciency that can be achieved is η = 1 − ω2/ω1
and . The maximal eﬃciency is achieved by any par-
tial swap operation, that is a rotation in the subspace

spanned by the states | + −i, | − +i. Among all partial
swaps, full swaps (that is operations that map | + −i into
| − +i (modulo a phase) and vice-versa) achieve maximal
work output. This behaviour can now be understood in
terms of Eq. (4): among all partial swaps, full swaps pro-
duce no correlation. It is also known [11] that at Carnot
eﬃciency (i.e., when ω2/ω1 → β1/β2) the work output
vanishes. This is now understood on the basis of Eq.
(16). It is worth emphasising that correlation and lags
are not independent on each other because they are both
functions of ρτ . This gives rise to a rich interplay between
the two sources of dissipation. To get an insight into this
interplay we consider the following gate operation:

U = USWAP(θ1) · UCNOT(θ2)

(18)

where UCNOT(θ2) is a partial CNOT gate, that is a rota-
tion of an angle θ2 in the space spanned by | − +i, | − −i,
followed by a partial swap USWAP(θ1), that is a rotation
in the space spanned by | − +i, | + −i. Fig. 3 presents
contour plots of work and eﬃciency as a function of θ1
and θ2. It also shows how the ratio

of correlation over lags behave at ﬁxed work and eﬃ-
ciency. The plots highlight how at ﬁxed eﬃciency the

lesser the relative strength of correlations, as compared
to lags, the more the work output. Vice-versa, at ﬁxed
work output, the higher the relative strength of correla-
tions the higher the eﬃciency. This evidences the very
remarkable fact that the build-up of correlations do not
necessarily represent a thermodynamic cost. Whether it
does so may depend on whether one is interested in the
work output or the eﬃciency. By comparison of the two
contour plots it is also possible to see that not necessarily
an increase in work output is accompanied by a decrease
in eﬃciency. It is in fact possible to draw curves in the
(θ1, θ2) plane where they both increase (not shown). A
similar occurrence has been recently noticed in [23].

CONCLUSIONS

We have identiﬁed correlations and lags as the two
sources of dissipation in driven multipartite systems, (Eq.
(4). In the case of heat engines, this implies the inequal-
ity (4), concerning the product of deviation from Carnot’s
eﬃciency and the work output. The interplay of lags and
correlations is illustrated with a two-qubit engine driven
by a partial CNOT-SWAP gate. The example shows that
correlation build up is not necessarily a thermodynamic
cost.
It can depend on whether one looks at work or
eﬃciency.

[24] We notice the interesting fact that the sum of lags and
correlations can also be expressed as a lag in the full
Hilbert space Pi D[ρi
] (this
is not true in general but depends on the initial state
being that of Eq. (6)), hence the multi-partite version of
diss = D[ρt|| ⊗ ρi,eq
Eq. (2) can also be written P βiW i
],
which is not immediately evident.
