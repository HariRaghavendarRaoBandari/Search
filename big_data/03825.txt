ABSTRACT

We present initial results from a program aimed at establishing a network of hot DA white dwarfs
to serve as spectrophotometric standards for present and future wide-ﬁeld surveys. These stars
span the equatorial zone and are faint enough to be conveniently observed throughout the year
with large-aperture telescopes. Spectra of these white dwarfs are analyzed to generate a non-local-
thermodynamic-equilibrium (NLTE) model atmosphere normalized to HST colors, including adjust-
ments for wavelength-dependent interstellar extinction. Once established, this standard star network
will serve ground-based observatories in both hemispheres as well as space-based instrumentation from
the UV to the near IR. We demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of this concept and show how two diﬀer-
ent approaches to the problem using somewhat diﬀerent assumptions produce equivalent results. We
discuss lessons learned and the resulting corrective actions applied to our program.

1. INTRODUCTION

Sub-percent global standardization of photometric cal-
ibration in astronomy remains elusive. Major ongo-
ing and planned astronomical surveys (including LSST,7
PanSTARRS,8 SDSS,9 the Dark Energy Survey with DE-
Cam,10 JWST,11 GALEX,12 and WISE 13) will have to
attain band-to-band photometry and all-sky uniformity
to better than 1% to realize their full scientiﬁc promise.
As a concrete example, consider the use of Type Ia su-
pernovae to probe the history of cosmic expansion and
determine the properties of dark energy. At present,
photometric calibration issues dominate the uncertainty
budget on the equation of state of the dark energy, w
(e.g., Sullivan et al. 2011; Suzuki et al. 2012; Betoule
et al. 2014). Weak lensing tomography with LSST also
demands sub-percent accuracies in color for reliable pho-
tometric redshift determination (e.g., Gorecki et al. 2014
require a systematic uncertainty of 0.005 mag or less for
their photometric redshift simulations).

Most of these surveys (as well as all post-Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) visible-band astronomy in the foresee-
able future) are or will be pursued from the ground.

For calibration at ground-based facilities, one source
of uncertainty is the time-variable transmissivity of the
atmosphere, with both chromatic (Rayleigh scattering,
Ozone absorption, Mie scattering, molecular absorption,
aerosol) as well as gray (cloud) terms. Attenuation from
clouds, water-vapor and aerosols can change rapidly and
on diﬀering angular scales and amplitudes, and over
all timescales (e.g., Querel & Kerber 2014). A vari-
ety of methods are currently used to track and account
for such eﬀects including monitoring with Light Detec-
tion and Ranging (LIDAR) techniques, using dual-band
Global Positioning System (GPS) metrology (e.g., Li
et al. 2014), and modeling the atmosphere (e.g., with
MODTRAN).

There remain, however, key obstacles to obtaining
ﬂuxes/colors in physical units at the 1% level or better:

1. Vega was one of six A0V stars used to establish the
color zero point on the photometric system of John-
son & Morgan (1953) by deﬁning the mean U − B
and B − V color of the six stars to be zero. This
deﬁnition was further extended to Cousins RC−IC.
Vega’s spectral energy distribution (SED) was tied
to tungsten-ribbon ﬁlament lamps and laboratory
blackbody sources employed as fundamental stan-
dards (Oke & Schild 1970; Hayes & Latham 1975,
and references therein). The laboratory sources
(placed at distances of order a mile) and Vega
were observed through a telescope and spectral
scanner, but corrections are necessary to account
for the extinction through the atmosphere along
very diﬀerent paths. In particular, the wavelength-
dependence of the aerosol scattering could not be
ascertained with suﬃcient conﬁdence and the con-
sequent uncertainty permeates the empirical deter-
mination of Vega’s SED. Alternatively, stellar at-
mosphere models of Vega have also been used as
its intrinsic SED, in lieu of the empirical compari-
son against a laboratory source (especially for ex-
tension into the UV and IR). Even if the models

2

Narayan et al.

were perfect, there are other complications. Vega’s
SED is punctuated with several unusually shaped
absorption lines. Vega has an excess of NIR emis-
sion longwards of 1–2 µm, likely a result of its dust
ring (Bohlin 2014) and possibly its rapid rotation
(Peterson et al. 2006). It also has an excess of UV
emission relative to a 9400K model (a result of its
rapid rotation (Bohlin et al. 2014)). These may
introduce systematic errors when such models are
used. As a result, the absolute calibration of Vega
has known deﬁciencies at the ∼ 1% level in the vis-
ible region and at the few percent level at near IR
and near UV regions (Blackwell et al. 1983; Selby
et al. 1983; Mountain et al. 1985).

2. Calibrations transferred from any one primary
standard to other objects around the sky using
ground-based observations suﬀer from seasonal and
site-speciﬁc systematic errors especially in the gray
component of extinction through the terrestrial at-
mosphere. Without a well-spaced network of cali-
brators, “self-calibration” (Schlaﬂy et al. 2012) or
“ubercal” (Padmanabhan et al. 2008) methods can-
not guarantee systemic all sky uniformity. They are
especially vulnerable to any seasonal variations in
declination dependence of atmospheric extinction.

3. Other currently used primary SED standards, such
as BD+17◦4708 and P330E, are too bright to be
directly imaged by the large aperture telescopes
employed by dark energy studies. Secondary stan-
dards are typically no fainter than magnitude 15,
which is not within the operating dynamic range
of surveys such as PanSTARRS, DES, and LSST.
Indirect links require bridging across ∼ 8 mags of
dynamic range to calibrate the surveys. This allows
various systematic errors to creep in.

The best way to circumvent the issues with the terres-
trial atmospheric extinction would be to ﬂy a standard
laboratory source, such as National Institute of Stan-
dards and Technology (NIST) calibrated standard, above
the atmosphere. The planning and execution of such an
expensive experiment takes a long time, however, and
much progress can be made towards establishing sub-
percent accuracy spectrophotometry now using existing
facilities and at much lower cost.

DA white dwarfs (WDs) have atmospheres domi-
nated by hydrogen and thus are the simplest stellar
atmospheres to model. The opacities are known from
ﬁrst principles and, in the temperature ranges (20,000–
80,000K) in which we are interested, photospheres are
purely radiative and photometrically stable. The SED
from such an atmosphere can be deﬁned by just two pa-
rameters: eﬀective temperature (Teﬀ) and surface gravity
(log g ). These parameters can be determined spectro-
scopically from a detailed analysis of the H I Balmer
proﬁles, without reference to any photometry. Thus the
SED, from the UV to the IR, can be calculated at arbi-
trary spectral resolution and used to calibrate any photo-
metric passband or spectroscopic system. A ﬂux normal-
ization in any chosen passband and accurate derivation
of reddening/extinction are the only other quantities re-
quired to fully characterize the received ﬂux and establish

such objects as spectrophotometric standards. Bohlin
(2014) used the HST Space Telescope Imaging Spectro-
graph (STIS) to observe three bright DA WDs spanning
a range of temperatures. These objects are unaﬀected
by reddening as interstellar absorption at Lyα implies a
low H I column density, corresponding to a reddening of
E(B − V ) < 0.0005. Bohlin (2014) found their relative
ﬂux distributions to be internally consistent with model
predictions from spectroscopic Teﬀ and log g to better
than 1% in the wavelength range 0.2− 1.0µm. This level
of internal consistency is superior to direct comparison
with Vega ﬂuxes from HST /STIS (Bohlin & Gilliland
2004).

The HST photometric scale is thus deﬁned relative to
model SEDs for 3 nearby DA WDs (Bohlin 2007). We
employ the HST “Vegamag” photometric scale through-
out this work. Holberg & Bergeron (2006) used synthetic
photometry of DA WDs to place U BV RI, 2MASS JHK,
SDSS ugriz and Stromgren ubvy magnitudes on the HST
photometric scale to 1%. Holberg et al. (2008) conﬁrmed
this calibration by using a set of DA WDs with good
trigonometric parallaxes that agreed at the 1% level with
their photometric parallaxes from the Bergeron photo-
metric grid.14

Modern large-telescope imaging surveys have an over-
lapping brightness range where the signal-to-noise ratio
(S/N ) is excellent for V ∼ 17 − 19 mag and where these
objects are unsaturated in the survey data. Thus we
must extend the WD scale to fainter reference objects.

The three WDs used to deﬁne the CALSPEC calibra-
tion are bright and near enough that line of sight extinc-
tion to them can be ignored. However, the WDs in our
desired brightness range are expected to have mild but
easily characterizable reddening that any experiment we
design must be able to quantify. There may be some faint
DA WDs at 17 to 18 mag in the Galactic polar caps, but
for all sky coverage, we cannot get around having to deal
with extinction. Notionally, spectroscopy to derive Teﬀ
and log g of suitably chosen DA WDs between 17 and
19 mag would be enough to deﬁne their SEDs. However
these brightness levels place the WDs at suﬃciently large
distances where interstellar extinction cannot be ignored.
Alternatively we could choose a purely empirical spec-
trophotometric extension of the CALSPEC calibration
by observing a more diverse class of objects at the desired
brightness with HST/STIS (so that the measurements do
not suﬀer from the eﬀects of the terrestrial atmosphere).
Such a sample could include redder objects and the ques-
tion of reddening would be inconsequential as we would
measure the net energy distribution. However, to build a
network of a couple of dozen such stars, so that some sub-
set of them are available at all times from all sites though
a variety airmasses, would require an amount of observ-
ing time with STIS that would be prohibitively large. It
would also preclude the possibility of extrapolating the
calibration to wavelengths outside the range of the ob-
servations. The STIS exposure time calculator (ETC)
reports integration times of several thousand seconds to
reach a S/N of 100 for a 40,000K black body with V = 18
mag in just one of three conﬁgurations that would be
minimally required to cover the wavelength range from

3000 − 18000˚A.
The approach taken by us utilizes the principle be-
hind the CALSPEC basis for calibration, but builds up
the system independently. By doing so, we also test the
proposition that the DA WD models are adequate, since
we intercompare results from many more objects for in-
ternal self-consistency. Our results need to stand inde-
pendently of any prior calibrations to be suﬃciently ro-
bust, which we think is worth the additional complica-
tions that our approach invokes.

In Table 1 we list 9 putative standard stars that are
part of our Cycle 20 HST Program (GO 12967, P.I.:
Saha), including the best available ground-based V -band
magnitudes. Our aim in this program is to derive eﬀec-
tive temperature, surface gravity, and interstellar red-
dening for these stars, that then fully parameterize (via
the stellar atmosphere model) the SED incident upon the
top of the Earth’s atmosphere, which is normalized with
respect to the HST ﬂux scale.

The essential goal of this program is to establish a set
of spectrophotometrically self-consistent calibrated stan-
dard stars, tied as well as possible to an absolute physi-
cal scale. Along the way, we are empirically testing the
proposition that DA WD atmospheric models result in
realistic SEDs by examining whether observed ﬂux ra-
tios from stars with diﬀerent atmospheric parameters are
consistent with model predictions, after derivation and
application of corrections to account for interstellar red-
dening.
In this paper we present initial ﬁndings that
deﬁne the level of consistency it is possible to achieve
using these procedures.

We aim to place a select set of DA WDs between mag-
nitude 17 and 19 on a common physical scale for ﬂux in-
cident at the top of the terrestrial atmosphere. This will
remove uncertainties in currently used SED standards
that are plagued with uncertain corrections for extinc-
tion within the terrestrial atmosphere. The expectation
is that sub-percent internal consistencies can be achieved,
which will be an improvement by several factors over any
currently employed photometric or spectrophotometric
system. A set of thus better-calibrated standard SED
sources referred to a physical (absolute) system, a subset
of which is always visible from any ground-based observa-
tory, will serve as universal standard calibration sources
for spectrophotometry and photometry.

In § 2 we describe the data attributes and reductions
for both the HST imaging, as well as the ground based
spectroscopy. In § 3 the photometry from the HST imag-
ing is described, along with the procedure to put the
measured magnitudes on the HST photometric scale de-
ﬁned by the three bright DA white dwarfs. The modeling
of the emergent and received ﬂux from each of the white
dwarfs is described in § 4, as is the derivation of redden-
ing/extinction to reconcile model and observed ﬂuxes. In
§ 5 we present an alternate approach to the reconcilia-
tion of model ﬂuxes and observed counts that bypasses
some of the assumptions made in § 4 and show that the
two complementary approaches produce the same results
to within the accuracy limitations of the data at hand.
This cross-validates some key assumptions and results of
both procedures. In § 6 we present predicted magnitudes
of four stars in the respective passbands of three current
imaging surveys. We conclude (in § 7) with a discussion
of caveats and lessons learned that have informed the

observing strategy for our HST Cycle 22 program.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

This program has

three operational components.
The ﬁrst consists of multi-band photometry from
HST /WFC3 images of each star that accurately tie the
ﬂuxes to the HST photometric scale. The second is a grid
of appropriate model atmospheres to generate detailed,
absolutely calibrated ﬂux distributions and model spec-
tra (in particular the line proﬁles of Balmer lines) for
each star. The third is high S/N Balmer line spectra,
nominally obtained with the Gemini Multi-Object Spec-
trograph (GMOS) instrument on Gemini South. The
observed Balmer line proﬁles are analyzed in reference
to the model proﬁles to accurately determine Teﬀ and
log g for each star. The model SEDs for stars with atmo-
spheric parameters so determined are then compared to
the observed HST /WFC3 photometry in multiple bands,
modulo a to-be-determined contribution from interstel-
lar reddening along the line of sight to each star. The
best match between model and measurement determines
the reddening/extinction parameter(s).

2.1. WFC3 Observations

Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) observations have been
obtained for all of the 9 target stars listed in Table 1,
These observations yield absolute photometric ﬂuxes in
the ﬁve bands (F 336W , F 475W , F 625W , F 775W , and
F 160W ) that are used to normalize the reddening cor-
rected model spectrum that deﬁnes the stellar ﬂux dis-
tributions. In Figure 1 we show the ﬁve WFC3 images
for one of our targets, SDSS-J102430.93, along with an
SDSS ﬁnder chart image of this star.

Fig. 1.— WFC3 images of SDSS-J102430.93 and an SDSS ﬁnder.
Exposure times have been chosen to ensure high S/N in each of
our ﬁve ﬁlters. Observations consist of 2–3 sub-exposures. Any
observation with only 2 sub-exposures will be supplemented with
an additional Cycle 22 observation. Additionally, we will obtain
F 275W observations of each target in Cycle 22.

All targets were placed near the center of the WFC3
UVIS2 detector. Each object is observed two or three
times in each band with small dithers to facilitate cosmic
ray rejection. The bands were chosen to ensure that the
temperature, surface gravity, and reddening could be in-
dependently determined, without signiﬁcant covariance.

Stromgren u (F 336W ) is chosen because it sits entirely
shortward of the Balmer jump and so allows a way to
measure it. For our targets, the Balmer jump is sensitive
to temperature. This dependency, however, is diﬀerent
from that of the Paschen continuum slope. The F 336W
observations therefore help to mitigate degeneracies be-
tween reddening and temperature—a critical prerequisite
for our study. F 475W , F 625W , and F 775W emulate
the Sloan gri bands, respectively, and were chosen so
that, in addition to measuring the Paschen continuum,
they also provide a direct measure in bands being used in
large surveys today (e.g., SDSS, PanSTARRS, and DES)
and those planned in the future (LSST). F 160W is the
HST /WFC3 equivalent for the H band, and it anchors
measurements of our objects as far into the infra-red as
HST will allow.

The exposure times were chosen to allow for S/N bet-
ter than 200 for each of the targeted white dwarfs while
staying shorter than half of the time to saturation. The
arrangements of the various exposures times within an
orbit were crafted to minimize “dead time” between ex-
posures and optimize program eﬃciency. A post-ﬂash
ﬂux was added to ensure the background level reached
12 electrons to mitigate charge transfer eﬃciency (CTE)
losses. Additional parallel observations that include stars
within a few arc-minutes from each of our target white
dwarfs were obtained with the Advanced Camera for Sur-
veys (ACS). Photometry for them, and an evaluation of
their usefulness as supplementary standard stars will be
presented in a future paper.

2.2. GMOS Observations

We used GMOS (Hook et al. 2004) at Gemini South to
obtain moderate resolution (R ∼ 1000), high-S/N spec-
troscopy of our WDs. The analysis of the detailed shape
of the H I Balmer proﬁles (Hβ to Hζ) provides primary
spectroscopic estimates of Teﬀ and log g that are inde-
pendent of photometry or SED slopes.

The observations were obtained in queue-scheduled
mode on GMOS with the B600 grating and a long slit
having a width of 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)5. Night sky lines had a full-width at
half maximum of ∼12˚A. In general, there were 6× 1500s
exposures made of each target. The inter-chip gaps be-
tween the three GMOS CCDs were ﬁlled by taking three
observations at one grating tilt and three at another. The

entire combined spectrum contiguously covers the wave-
length region between 3500 ˚A to 6360 ˚A with dispersion
of 0.92 ˚A/pix. We resampled the spectra onto a single
linear scale at 1˚A per bin. We used standard IRAF15
routines to process the CCD data and optimally extract
(Horne 1986) the spectra. The overall S/N per resolu-
tion element is very high, averaging from 80 to 170 for
our targets. We used our own IDL routines (Matheson
et al. 2008) to ﬂux calibrate the spectra using Feige 110
(Stone 1977). Strictly speaking, the ﬂux calibration is
not needed (and in any case rests on a less accurate ba-
sis than the ones we seek to establish), and the analysis
presented in §4.1 is independent of the ﬂux calibration of
the spectra. Nevertheless, getting the continuum slopes
as correct as possible helps when analyzing the shapes of
the wide Balmer lines.

At this time, there are ﬁve targets (of the nine in Ta-
ble 1) for which we have complete spectra and photom-
etry. Their spectra are shown in Figure 2. One of these,
SDSS-J203722.16, exhibits narrow emission lines in the
cores of the Balmer absorption features. The emission
lines shift with time. This could indicate the presence of
a low-luminosity companion, such as an M star, although
there are other possibilities. We exclude this object from
all further analysis. The remaining four spectra are very
characteristic of DA white dwarfs and appear free of con-
tamination by companions.

Because the calibration standard star was not always
observed contemporaneously with the targets, we vali-
dated the calibration by comparisons with the expected
ﬂuxes obtained by preliminary reddened model ﬂuxes.
In Figure 3 we show such a comparison. As discussed in
§4, the method used to analyze individual Balmer pro-
ﬁles is relatively insensitive to any residual calibration
uncertainties.

The overall response of the grating and detector
yielded a count rate spectrum that peaks very near Hβ
and falls oﬀ signiﬁcantly to the blue. At Hζ the sig-
nal is approximately 30% of peak, leading to signiﬁcant
S/N gradient across the Balmer lines. Fortunately the
overall S/N is very high, averaging from 80 to 170 per

servatory, which is operated by AURA under cooperative agree-
ment with the NSF.

emission lines in the cores of the Balmer lines; a magniﬁed view of the Hβ line is shown in the inset for 2 epochs 13 days apart during which
time the emission feature has moved by 5.3 pixels. As the observations were obtained under good seeing with a wide slit, the wavelength
shift need not be solely due to a change in the relative velocity of the emission feature. Our spectra have S/N between 80–170 with a
dispersion of 0.92 ˚A/pix. Even the weak Hζ feature is clearly resolved.

bin for our targets. For some targets, we have obtained
supplemental spectroscopic observations using IMACS
(Dressler et al. 2011) at Magellan, and the Blue Channel
(Schmidt et al. 1989) at the MMT. They have similar
S/N and resolution, and cover the same spectral range
as the GMOS conﬁguration.

3. PHOTOMETRIC ANALYSIS

As this program requires extremely accurate and pre-
cise determinations of the white dwarf ﬂux, we have
elected to use two independent methods to photometer
our WFC3 observations. The drizzled (drz) images from
the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) are
processed using SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996).
The images are ﬁrst masked to remove pixels in the flt
image ﬁle that are only derived from a single exposure
(determined from the ctx extension) and sources above
the saturation threshold. A 64-pixel background mesh is
used with an 8-pixel ﬁlter size to smooth the image and
estimate the background locally. This procedure removes
virtually all spurious objects (cosmic rays, drizzling ar-
tifacts, etc.). We use a range of apertures from 4–25
pixels to measure the ﬂux of each source. As WFC3 has
a physical image scale of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)04/pix on UVIS and 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)13/pix
on the IR channel, this corresponds to 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)16–1.(cid:48)(cid:48)0 on UVIS
and 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)52–3.(cid:48)(cid:48)25 on the IR channel. We construct curves

of growth for each image from objects with stellar point
spread functions (PSFs). We use a simple ﬁltering rou-
tine to remove any objects that are more than 3σ away
from the mean curve of growth in more than 3 aper-
tures. This removes any objects with close companions
and any non-stellar sources. We use the mean curve of
growth of the image to interpolate between the measured
aperture ﬂux in each pixel to determine the precise ﬂux
with a physical aperture size of radius 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)4. The weight
wht map output from multidrizzle is used to estimate
the uncertainties.

Measurements were also made using an interactive pro-
gram written by one of us (AS). A curve of growth (COG)
as function of aperture size is constructed and the back-
ground level is set to be that value for which the COG is
ﬂat in the radius range 9 to 12 pixels (0.(cid:48)(cid:48)36–0.(cid:48)(cid:48)48) in the
UVIS images and between 6 and 8 pixels radius (0.(cid:48)(cid:48)78–
1.(cid:48)(cid:48)04) in the IR channel data. The ‘background’ thus
measured is actually within the low level wings of the
stellar PSF, but allows the use of a tight aperture so
that S/N is not compromised and chances of encounter-
ing any unremoved cosmic rays or other pathologies is
minimized. Using published encircled energy curves,16

atically for “inﬁnite” radius apertures (and referred to
the true background), which include all of the incident
light from a given object. Look-up tables for these cor-
rections were made for each passband and applied as ap-
propriate. These interactively made measurements, al-
though time-consuming, are judged to be a good invest-
ment towards quality assessment because they quickly
reveal the common kinds of image pathologies that defy
assumptions inherent in our data models. These inter-
active measurements were made on both flt and drz
images, where the flt images were corrected for varia-
tions in pixel area. Concordant measurements on both
sets of images indicate whether the multidrizzle pro-
cess compromises data quality (e.g., by being overzeal-
ous about CR rejection and cropping the tips of bright
stars). Agreement across the two measuring methods es-
tablishes that methodology-dependent systematic errors
are not being injected.

As the WFC3 detector sensitivity is a function of time,
the zeropoints are time dependent. Rather than rely on
the ﬁducial zeropoints supplied by MAST, we measured
the zeropoints directly using contemporaneous observa-
tions of CALSPEC primary standard, GD153, obtained
through HST GO program 13575 (P.I.: S. Deustua).
These are applied as an additive adjustment to the ﬁdu-
cial MAST zeropoint. Subrastered images of GD153 are
available with the target at the same position on the
detector as our DA white dwarfs, however not in all of
our passbands (F 775W is missing). We are obtaining
contemporaneous observations of all three primary stan-
dards in Cycle 22 to determine instrumental zeropoints,
and tie our measurements directly to this photometric
system.

In this work, we have measured GD153’s instrumen-

tal magnitudes using the same process for our targets,
as described above. We applied the ﬁducial MAST ze-
ropoints to our instrumental magnitude, and compared
these magnitudes against synthetic photometry of the
CALSPEC model of GD153 (gd153 fos 003)17 through
the WFC3 passbands. The synthetic photometry is de-
scribed in §4, by Equation 5. While this procedure is
not as optimal as tying our measurements directly to the
three HST primary standards, it is best methodology
possible given the extant data.

We found a diﬀerence between the synthetic and mea-
sured magnitudes that exhibits a strong linear trend with
passband frequency. The measurements in each pass-
band, and the linear trend is shown in Figure 4. There
is no process through which our measurement technique,
which treats all the images individually, can introduce
such a linear trend with frequency. The largest discrep-
ancy was found in the ultraviolet and the smallest diﬀer-
ences in the optical. No signiﬁcant diﬀerence was found
in the WFC3/IR channel, which has a completely dif-
ferent detector and light path through the camera. The
observed trend therefore indicated a possible diﬀerence
between the reported and true eﬃciency of the UVIS de-
tectors.

This ﬁnding was independently replicated by staﬀ sci-
entists at STScI. As the two WFC3/UVIS CCDs were
manufactured on diﬀerent wafers and foundry produc-
tion runs, their physical properties, such as quantum
eﬃciency and thickness, diﬀer. Studies at STScI have
found that UVIS2 is ∼ 30% more sensitive in the UV
than UVIS1. In the range 3500 − 7000˚A, the two CCDs
have comparable sensitivity, while at wavelengths longer

Furthermore, the two detectors have diﬀerent detection
layer thicknesses. For UVIS1 the median thickness is
16.04 ± 0.23 microns, and for UVIS2 it is 15.42 ± 0.58
microns18.
New ﬂat-ﬁelds that treat the two UVIS detectors indi-
vidually have been created and will be applied to future
MAST products. For this work, we correct the ﬁducial
MAST zeropoints for each of our passbands with the lin-
ear relation we found. These corrected zeropoints are
applied to the measured ﬂux to produce the observed
magnitudes for the targets used in this work. The pho-
tometry and measurement uncertainties for these targets

4.1. Line Proﬁle Fitting

We have analyzed the Balmer proﬁles of each star
in a manner similar to that described by Bergeron
et al. (1992) and Liebert et al. (2005). We use Tlusty
NLTE model atmospheres (Hubeny & Lanz 1995) (ver-
sion 203)19 to match the models used by Bohlin et al.
(2014). Each Balmer proﬁle is individually extracted
with a window centered on the proﬁle and extending well
into the wings. These extracted proﬁles are ‘ﬂattened’ by
constructing a linear interpolation between ﬁxed points
in the far wings of the proﬁles. This ﬂattening places
the burden of determining Teﬀ and log g solely on the

quasi-symmetrical line proﬁles and decouples the analy-
sis from temperature dependent slopes in the underlying
SED. The model proﬁles are ﬂattened in precisely the
same fashion. Minimum χ2 ﬁts are sought between mod-
els and observations and contours enclosing 68% and 95%
of the total likelihood around the maximum likelihood es-
timate are constructed. The proﬁles, ﬁt, and likelihood
surface for SDSS-J102430.93 are shown in Figure 5.

The likelihood surfaces show very low covariance be-
tween Teﬀ and log g. This is unsurprising as the two
parameters change the shape of the Balmer proﬁles in
distinct ways. Uncertainties are directly estimated from
the 1-D marginalized likelihoods for both parameters. As
the spectra have to be dereddened before the line proﬁles
are ﬁt, we also examine the covariance between Teﬀ and
log g and the ﬁducial value of E(B−V ) used to deredden
the spectrum, derived from SDSS DR12 photometry. We
ﬁnd a weak linear covariance of both Teﬀ and log g over
a range of ±0.05 in E(B − V ). This range in E(B − V )
is much larger than the uncertainty in the value deter-
mined from our WFC3 photometry. We ﬁnd that the
maximum diﬀerence in the best ﬁt values for Teﬀ and
log g over the entire range of E(B − V ) are less than
0.3 of the uncertainty in Teﬀ and log g. The changes
in χ2 over the same value are not statistically signiﬁ-
cant and reﬂect the diﬀerent centering of the grid of Teﬀ
and log g over which the minimum chi-squared ﬁt is de-
termined. This demonstrates that the temperature and
surface gravity determined from spectra are completely
insensitive to the ﬁducial interstellar E(B − V ) used to
deredden the spectrum.
Our methodology is insensitive to the choice of model.
While model atmospheres are generated as a function of
Teﬀ and log g, these are nuisance parameters that serve

as labels for a speciﬁc line shape. Two diﬀerent models
may have diﬀerent values of Teﬀ and log g for the same
line shape. Our procedure is only aﬀected by relative
ﬂux diﬀerences at constant line shape. We estimate the
systematic error arising from the choice of a speciﬁc set
of model atmospheres by ﬁtting the Rauch et al. (2013,
hereafter RWBK) models for the HST primary standards
derived in Bohlin (2014). We ﬁt the RWBK models using
the same procedure as the observed white dwarf spec-
tra. The resulting model atmospheres are normalized at
5556˚A. The relative ﬂux ratios are shown in Figure 6.

The Tlusty models at the ﬁducial temperature and
surface gravity of the RWBK model are a close match
to the Bohlin (2014) models. Fitting the line proﬁles
of the RWBK models improves the agreement between
the two models, and the synthetic photometry diﬀerence
is less than 0.003 mag in all passbands. The residual
diﬀerence in the line shape arises from a diﬀerence in
the shapes of the line proﬁles between the RWBK and
Tlusty models, likely a result of the diﬀerent prescrip-
tions used for Stark broadening. Sharp discontinuities in
the relative ﬂux ratio arise from diﬀerences in the con-
tinuum between the two models. This is most evident in
the models of G191B2B. Both models are interpolated
from model atmosphere grids, piece-wise over diﬀerent
wavelength ranges, and these diﬀerent sections are com-
bined together to create a model atmosphere spanning
the full wavelength range at the desired values of Teﬀ
and log g. These discontinuities reﬂect diﬀerences in the
grids and the diﬀerent interpolation schemes adopted by
the two models, rather than any diﬀerence in the under-
lying physics.

Fig. 5.— (Left) Balmer line proﬁles extracted from the GMOS spectrum (black) and model ﬁts (red) for SDSS-J102430.93, the same
object shown in Figure 3. The central wavelength of each feature is indicated below the line. Small vertical oﬀsets have been added to
the continuum of each line for visualization. Even the extremely weak Hζ feature is well modeled. (Right) The log likelihood surface in
Teﬀ-log g space for the ﬁt are shown along with contours enclosing 68%, 95%, and 99.7% of the likelihood surface around the maximum
likelihood estimate (solid, dashed, and dot-dashed, respectively). Marginalizations are shown in the inset plots. The 1-D distributions are
well-modeled by Gaussians and the peak is indicated in the legend. There is virtually no covariance between the two parameters, indicating
that are observations are suﬃcient to constrain both independently.

In most prior work on photometric standards, interstel-
lar reddening has not been a signiﬁcant issue. The stars
presented here, though, are from one to three magnitudes
fainter and signiﬁcantly more distant so interstellar red-
dening needs to be considered, estimated, and applied.
Our working model is to assume that the DA white dwarf
models correctly predict the emergent ﬂux from the star,
and so the diﬀerence between observed magnitudes and
model predictions must show the color signature from
the Galactic reddening law. Since we have photometry
in multiple bands, failure of either the Galactic redden-
ing law, or of the SED model for emergent ﬂux, will show
up as discrepancies. If all the passbands are consistent
with these assumptions, then the SED model plus the
reddening/extinction value fully describes the received
SED from the white dwarf. Accordingly we proceed as
described below.

4.2.1. Synthetic Photometry

With the best ﬁt temperature and surface gravity, we
generate a full model SED for the white dwarf, from
1300-25000˚A. We use the pysynphot package,20 and con-
volve the model SED with the response function of the
observed HST passbands. We model the passband trans-
missions as the product of three components: the optical
train (Opt), the ﬁlter (PB) and the Quantum Eﬃciency
of the WFC3 detectors (OE).

The published passband transmissions are based on pre-
ﬂight laboratory measurements, and represent the ﬁdu-
cial system throughput.
In principle, it is possible to
determine the count-rate yielded by an object with an
F (λ) spectrum throughput by simply computing the in-
tegral of the ﬂux through the passband. However, all
three components of the transmission are time variable,
and this is reﬂected in periodic updates to the published
MAST zeropoints. We therefore derive synthetic zero-
points for each passband, T , using the deﬁnition of the
HST “Vegamag” system that deﬁnes Vega to have a mag-
nitude of zero at all wavelengths. The synthetic ﬂux, and
magnitude, φ, and m, respectively, is given by

standards GD153 (top), GD71 (middle) and G191B2B (bottom). The dashed gray line indicates the relative ﬂux ratio between the two
models at the ﬁducial Teﬀ and log g determined by Bohlin (2014). Fitting the line proﬁles of the RWBK models using the Tlusty models
improves the agreement between the two sets of models (solid black lines). The residual diﬀerences are dominated by small diﬀerences in
the shapes of the line proﬁles between the two models, likely because of diﬀerent prescriptions used to model Stark broadening. Overall, the
line proﬁle shapes are very similar (right panels). As these diﬀerences are small and nearly symmetric about unity, they do not contribute
signiﬁcantly to any net ﬂux diﬀerence. We use a Savitzky-Golay ﬁlter to smooth the relative ﬂux ratio and highlight regions where the
models disagree (solid green lines). There are, however, no signiﬁcant departures from unity. Discontinuities in the ﬂux ratio in the UV
arise from diﬀerences in the interpolation schemes adopted by the two models and are only signiﬁcant in the F 336W ﬂux for G191B2B.
A change in the Teﬀ of the Tlusty model of under +1000K is suﬃcient to reduce the eﬀect of the discontinuity to less than 0.001 in the
relative ﬂux ratio.

dening and normalization for the distance, and radius
is treated in §4.2.2. We use the CALSPEC composite
stellar spectrum of Vega (alpha lyr stis 005)21 as our
model for Vega’s SED, F S
Vega. The CALSPEC model for
Vega, and GD153 used in §3 are normalized consistently
internally, and thus synthetic magnitudes produced rel-
ative to the Vega model are directly comparable to the
observed magnitudes that have been tied to GD153. In
Cycle 22, we will obtain observations of all three primary
standards in all of our bands, and tie our observations
to the average of all three, obviating the need to put our
observations on the “Vegamag” system.

The results of applying the above procedure to the four
DA white dwarfs for which the spectroscopic and photo-
metric data are complete (discarding the discrepant ob-
ject with the emission components in the Balmer lines)
are shown in Table 2 and graphically in Figure 7.
In-
cluded in the Table are the three ﬁtted parameters, AV ,
Teﬀ, and log g, intrinsic normalized magnitude before red-
dening, the extinction in each band, and the net pre-
dicted magnitude per band. Both synthetic quantities
include the normalization constant, ci. Comparison of
column 9 with column 3 (predicted vs. observed magni-
tudes with WFC3/HST ) corresponds to the ﬁt residuals
per band given in column 10. Note that the extreme
residuals are +/ − 0.006 with rms = 0.003 mag.
If we use the extinction law of O’Donnell (1994) instead
of Fitzpatrick (1999), the derived AV values change by
1 milli-mag, thereby indicating that our experiment is
insensitive to diﬀerences between these forms of the red-
dening law.

establish the zeropoints of color. These assumptions cre-
ate a formal dependency on the state of calibration of
WFC3, and on the currently adopted SEDs of GD153
and Vega. The “constructionist” approach taken in the
above section is thus vulnerable to the state of calibration
of WFC3. Thus, we have had to correct the zeropoints,
as in equation 1.

However, there is indication that the WFC3 zeropoints
are uncertain at the 0.01 mag level. For example, the cur-
rent MAST zeropoints are prefaced by a discussion that
states “The tables below summarize results determined
from a new reduction of all SMOV4, Cycle 17, and Cycle
18 observations of GD153, G191B2B, GD71, and P330E.
The independent calibrations from the four stars agree
to within 1% in most ﬁlters, and the photometric zero-
point is set to the average of the measurements.” All
four of these stars have nominally zero reddening, and
have equal weight in the determination of the WFC3 ze-
ropoints.

Given this reality, and our goal of achieving precisions
substantially better than 1%, we have explored an al-
ternate approach to optimally determining the redden-
ing and SEDs of our white dwarfs.
In this approach,
we determine an optimal set of stellar parameters and
passband-dependent aperture corrections by ﬁtting the
synthetic magnitudes for all stars simultaneously to the
observed instrumental magnitudes,
including for each
star an extinction value and a passband-independent ze-
ropoint. The only assumptions here are that DA white
dwarf models do predict SEDs accurate to a few mil-
limag or better, the standard Galactic reddening law is
valid for our targets, the published WFC3 passbands are
approximately correct in shape, and the bright DA white
dwarf GD153 has zero reddening.

We develop the following formalism, using the same

notation adopted in § 4.2.

The above analysis is contingent on the state of calibra-
tion of WFC3, and the assertion that CALSPEC stan-
dards have SEDs known very accurately. The shape of
the WFC3 passbands is implicitly assumed to be cor-
rect. The SED of GD153, a DA white dwarf itself, is
used to adjust the overall normalization of the eﬀective
passbands, and the CALSPEC SED of Vega is used to

We deﬁne another band independent constant, Ci, to
account for the geometry (radius of the star, and dis-
tance to the star) that modulates for each target star,
the ﬂux at the stellar surface to that incident at the top
of the terrestrial atmosphere. The instrumental magni-
tude, mX , can then be written in terms of synthetic (S)
quantities as::

this is simply:

If the model ﬂuxes are correct, the synthetic instru-
mental magnitudes will equal the observed instrumental
magnitudes. However, the synthetic magnitudes implic-
itly count all photons detected from the object, regard-
less of where they end up in the PSF, while the observed
magnitudes count detected photons only within a ﬁnite
radius (0.(cid:48)(cid:48)4 in our case). The resulting diﬀerence is the
aperture correction and is band dependent because the
PSF is. A nominal value of the aperture corrections is
available from MAST, but we leave them as values to be
determined from the data. Denoting the aperture cor-
rection as ∆T , we then expect that

mX

T,i + ∆T

or, expressed another way,

δT,i ≡ mX

T,i − mS

T,i − ∆T = K X,S

(12)

(13)

Note that, although we expect the dominant contribu-
tion to ∆T to come from the aperture correction, any
bandpass dependent error, including putative errors in
calibrating the instrument, will contribute. The depen-
dence of δT,i on the passband, T , is a powerful diagnos-
tic. Equation 13 tells us that the wavelength dependence
should be fully accounted for by the aperture correction,
and the synthetic model. If there is a discrepancy, it can
arise from several causes:

• The aperture corrections ∆T are incorrect.
• There is extinction aﬀecting the real object that is

not represented in the model.

• The model ﬂuxes have errors not accounted for by

extinction.

Given the distance to our stars, it is likely that they will
be aﬀected by some amount of extinction (interstellar,
and possibly circumstellar), we can ﬁt for the reddening,
and analyze the remaining residuals for the other causes
listed above. The extinguished synthetic magnitude is:

where αi(λ) is the transmission function of the extinction

We parameterize αi(λ) in terms of the quantities RV
and E(B−V,i), and calculate it by the prescription of
O’Donnell (1994). We can then determine the extinction
parameters, along with the ∆T and K X,S
by minimizing

with the constraint that EB−V,i ≥ 0 ∀i.
With our current four stars and 5 WFC3 passbands,
χ2 depends on 12 parameters, while we have 20 mea-
surements, so the minimization problem is potentially
well constrained. Additional stars and/or passbands will
constrain the solution further. We keep RV = 3.1 for the
present, although it could in principle be included in the
parameters being optimized.

There are two diﬃculties with this approach, however.
The ﬁrst one is trivial. There is a partial degeneracy be-
tween the ∆T and K X,S
, in that an arbitrary constant
can be added to all the ∆T and then subtracted from all
the K X,S
without changing the value of χ2. This need-
lessly complicates the job of the optimizer, and makes
the results harder to interpret. We deal with this by
enforcing

i

∆T = 0

(16)

T

The second diﬃculty is more serious. Experience with
minimizing χ2 as given above shows that the minimum
is consistently achieved by choosing the ∆T so that the
extinction of the least extinguished star comes out to
be zero. This is readily achieved, since the right choice
for ∆T can mimic an arbitrary extinction, that is then
eﬀectively subtracted from the extinctions of all the stars.
This behavior is unphysical, and must be remedied by
an additional data-based constraint. We have chosen to
use the observations of GD153 discussed in Section 3 in
conjunction with the conclusion of Bohlin et al. (2014)
that its extinction is zero to high precision.

To make use of this constraint, we treat the GD153
data in the same way as the program stars, but its con-
tribution to χ2 is treated diﬀerently in that when calcu-
lating the model ﬂux, EB−V,GD153 = 0 by assumption.
The GD153 contribution to the overall χ2 is multiplied by
a weighting factor large enough to ensure that any signif-
icant deviation from this assumption is suppressed. The
summation over bands includes only F 336W , F 475W ,
and F 625W , since we currently lack GD153 data for the
other bands. The model ﬂux for GD153 uses the G11
values for Teﬀ and log g from Bohlin (2014).

analysis of the results, the minimization was carried out
a large number of times using independent samples from
Gaussian distributions of Teﬀ, log g and {mO
T,i}. The co-
variance matrix for these quantities is assumed to be di-
agonal. The uncertainties in the distributions come from
Table 2. Table 3 shows the resulting mean values of AV
for the four stars, their statistical uncertainties, and the
mean standard deviation of the ﬁt to the observed mag-
nitudes for each star. Table 4 presents the mean values of
the derived aperture corrections, ∆T , for the ﬁve WFC3
bands we employ, and the nominal values from MAST.
It is noteworthy that the agreement between our derived
aperture corrections, ∆T , and the ﬁducial MAST val-
ues is excellent, with discrepancies of order 0.01 mag, as
expected.

Comparison with AV values in Table 3 with those in
Table 2 that are derived by the other procedure shows
diﬀerences of a few millimag, with consequent diﬀerences
in SED ﬂuxes over the observed passband range of 10 or
20 millimag. We expect that with the Cycle 22 data,
which includes observation in F 275W and contempora-
neous constraining observation of all three HST white
dwarf calibrators, the SEDs from both approaches will
result in closer agreement for the derived ﬁnal SEDs.
We emphasize that all quoted uncertainties are purely
statistical.

6. EXPECTED MAGNITUDES ON COMMON

PHOTOMETRIC SYSTEMS

As our targets are within the dynamic range of present
wide-ﬁeld survey facilities, we provide expected synthetic
magnitudes for SDSS, PanSTARRS, and DECam photo-
metric systems in Table 5. The passband throughputs
used to synthesize magnitudes include the attenuation
from the terrestrial atmosphere at a representative air-
mass of 1.3 at the respective observatory sites. Where
available, we have compared our synthetic photometry
to published photometry from surveys from their respec-
tive facilities.

In all cases we quote magnitudes on the AB system,
as deﬁned for photon proportional detection systems in
Fukugita et al. (1996) (see their equation 7). We have
converted from our HST -based photometric system to
AB by determining the AB magnitude of Vega.

The mean absolute value of the residuals between the
observed and synthetic photometry are within 0.025 mag
for the ugri bands within SDSS DR12, completely in
line with the 2–3% systematic error associated with the
absolute calibration of the SDSS photometry onto the
AB system.

The observed PanSTARRS photometry is from Tonry
et al. (2012) and Schlaﬂy et al. (2012), and adjusted by

the oﬀsets reported in Scolnic et al. (2015). There are no
measurements reported for SDSSJ102430.93. The resid-
uals to the PanSTARRS photometry show a negative
bias in the y band, however this bias is within 2−−3σ of
the large reported uncertainties of the photometry. The
PanSTARRS 3pi survey images have signiﬁcantly more
cosmetic issues than the SDSS photometry, and care-
ful analysis of these images with imporoved masking of
diﬀraction spikes, ghosts, and cosmic rays will likely im-
prove the agreement between the observed and synthetic
photometry.

7. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

We have presented the results from four faint DA white
dwarfs that demonstrate the proposition that DA white
dwarf ﬂuxes as predicted from models are consistent with
observations. This proposition has been the basis for
HST calibrated ﬂuxes for some time now.
In this pa-
per we have demonstrated that for fainter objects, where
modest amounts of reddening must taken into account,
the simple extension that includes solving for and apply-
ing individual self-determined reddening corrections over
a wide range of wavelengths using a standard Milky Way
reddening law works quite well, producing residuals of a
few millimag. Nevertheless, there are several caveats to
consider, some of which will be addressed in our continu-
ing work as more data on more objects become available.
What our results really show is that the models ac-
curately predict SED ratios between DA white dwarfs,
i.e., the models are validated as diﬀerential predictors.
It does not, however, test whether the models predict
the absolute SEDs correctly. This is likely the domi-
nant source of systematic uncertainty. We can get some
purchase on it by comparing diﬀerent sets of DA white
dwarf models. A comprehensive discussion can be found
in Bohlin et al. (2014), where current models are found to
diﬀer by more than 1% (and as much as 5%) short-ward
of 0.27 µm and long-ward of 5 µm It is also possible
that our understanding of the relevant atomic and at-
mospheric processes is yet incomplete. Nevertheless the
validation of models as a good diﬀerential predictor of
SEDs is already a tool that will enable us to calibrate
photometric systems to a few millimag accuracy. The
data we present here (and in future papers to come) will
continue to anchor results, as model improvements and
validation take place.

There are also additional caveats, but for these we have

speciﬁc mitigation plans:

1. There are improvements underway to our process-
ing steps.
In particular, there is covariance be-
tween eﬀective temperature and reddening. The
data analysis ﬂow is being redesigned to ﬁt both
these parameters (along with log g) in the same
process.

2. For the 9 targets observed in the HST GO-12967
(Cycle 20) program, there are additional photo-
metric data being gathered in the Cycle 22 HST
GO-13711 program. The additional images will not
only secure the photometry, but an additional pass-
band (F275W in the near UV) will allow us to ex-
amine if the standard extinction law for reddening
is indeed adequate.

3. We are obtaining contemporaneous observations of
all three HST primary standards, GD153, GD71
and G191B2B in our Cycle 22 program. This will
allow us to tie our measurements directly on to
the CALSPEC photometric scale, without the ad-
ditional step of tying to the “Vegamag” scale, that
in turn is tied to CALSPEC.

4. There has been little or no long term monitoring
of these objects for constancy. We are seeking to
pursue this from the ground.

5. It is known that a small fraction of DA white
dwarfs have gaseous and planetary debris around
them and some display pollution from metals (e.g.,
Koester et al. 2014). These can produce anomalous
SEDs. Metal pollution is detectable only in the far
UV. A program to observe our target DA white
dwarfs with COS on HST would be necessary to
constrain this potential systematic.

6. Magnetic ﬁelds have sometimes been observed in
DA stars in our temperature range. The eﬀect of
such ﬁelds can be two fold. First, undetected Zee-
man splitting in the Balmer lines can bias tem-
perature and gravity determinations. Second, a
rotating magnetic white dwarf can exhibit observ-
able ﬂux variations (Holberg & Howell 2011). Flux
monitoring and spectroscopy of the Hα line can ﬂag
the presence of such eﬀects.

As a result of the above cautionary points, and with
speciﬁc plans under way for their mitigation, we urge

that the results for the four DA white dwarfs presented
in Tables 2 and 5 be treated as provisional. Nevertheless,
we will be very surprised if they change by more than a
percent and we publish them so that they can be tested
by observers.
