Abstract

For a multiplicative cohomology theory E, complex orientations
are in bijective correspondence with multiplicative natural transfor-
mations to E from complex bordism cohomology M U . If E is rep-
resented by a spectrum with a highly structured multiplication, we
give an iterative process for lifting an orientation M U → E to a map
respecting this extra structure, based on work of Arone–Lesh. The
space of strictly commutative orientations is the limit of an inverse
tower of spaces parametrizing partial lifts; stage 1 corresponds to or-
dinary complex orientations, and lifting from stage (m − 1) to stage m
is governed by the existence of a orientation for a family of E-modules
over a ﬁxed base space Fm.

When E is p-local, we can say more. We ﬁnd that this tower only
changes when m is a power of p, and if E is E(n)-local the tower
is constant after stage pn. Moreover, if the coeﬃcient ring E∗ is p-
torsion free, the ability to lift from stage 1 to stage p is equivalent
to a condition on the associated formal group law that was shown
necessary by Ando.

Characteristic classes play a fundamental role in algebraic topology, with the
primary example being the family of Chern classes ci(ξ) ∈ H 2i(X) associ-
ated to a complex vector bundle ξ → X. Not all generalized cohomology

theories possess Chern classes, but they are present in important cases such
as complex K-theory K and complex bordism theory MU. In fact, for a co-
homology theory E taking values in graded-commutative rings, the following
types of information are equivalent:

• a choice of characteristic class c1(ξ) ∈ eE2(X) for complex line bundles
ξ → X such that c1(γ1) = 1 for the canonical line bundle γ1 → CP1;
• a family of characteristic classes ci(ξ) ∈ eE2i(X) for complex vector
bundles ξ → X such that c1(γ1) = 1 and such that the Cartan formula
for Whitney sums holds; or

• a natural transformation MU → E of multiplicative cohomology theo-

ries.

In the third case, the natural transformation MU 2i(X) → E2i(X) allows us
to push forward the characteristic classes cM U
i (ξ). Such a
map MU → E is called a complex orientation of E, and as a result MU
plays a fundamental role in the theory of Chern classes.

(ξ) to classes cE

Moving from the homotopy category to the point-set level, the spectrum
MU representing complex bordism is also one of the best known examples of
a spectrum with a multiplication which is associative and commutative up
to all higher coherences (an E∞ ring structure). If we know that E is also
equipped with an E∞ ring structure, it is natural to ask whether a complex
orientation MU → E can be lifted to a map respecting this E∞ ring structure
(an E∞ orientation), and what data is necessary to describe this. This is a
stubborn problem and in prominent cases the answer is unknown, such as
when E is a Lubin–Tate spectrum.

For any complex orientation of E, there is a formal group law G expressing
the ﬁrst Chern class of a tensor product of two complex line bundles: we
have

c1(ξ′ ⊗C ξ′′) = c1(ξ′) +G c1(ξ′′)

for an associative, commutative, and unital power series x +G y ∈ E ∗ Jx, yK.
Ando gave a necessary and suﬃcient condition for an orientation MU → E
to be an H∞ orientation [And92], a weaker structure than an E∞ orientation
which can be described as a natural transformation that respects geometric

2

power operations. Ando’s condition was that a certain natural power opera-
tion Ψ with source E ∗(X) should act as the canonical Lubin isogeny on the
coordinate ring E ∗(CP∞) of the formal group law G (see also [AHS04, §4.3]).
In general, this is stronger than the data of a complex orientation alone [JN],
and very few E∞ ring spectra are known to admit H∞ orientations.

However, it is the case that the rationalization MUQ is universal among
rational, complex oriented E∞ rings [BR, 6.1]. Further, Walker studied ori-
entations for the case of p-adic K-theory and the Todd genus [Wal08], and
M¨ollers studied orientations in the case of K(1)-local spectra [M¨ol10]. Both
gave proofs that Ando’s condition for H∞ orientations was also suﬃcient to
produce E∞ orientations.

The goal of this paper is to apply work by Arone–Lesh [AL07] to extend this
procedure, giving an inductive approach to the construction of E∞ orienta-
tions. Before getting into details, we will describe the motivation for this
construction.

As an E∞ ring spectrum, the fact that MU is a Thom spectrum gives it
a universal property. There is a map of inﬁnite loop spaces U → GL1(S)
from the inﬁnite unitary group to the space of self-equivalences of the sphere
spectrum S, and MU is universal among E∞ ring spectra E with a chosen
nullhomotopy of the map of inﬁnite loop spaces U → GL1(S) → GL1(E)
[May77, §V].

We can recast this using the language of Picard groups. We consider two nat-
ural functors: one sends a complex vector space V to the spectrum Σ∞SV ,
which has an inverse under the smash product; the second sends a smash-
invertible spectrum I to a smash-invertible MU-module MU ∧ I. On re-
stricting to the subcategory of weak equivalences and applying classifying
spaces, we obtain maps of E∞ spaces

a

m

BU(m) → Z × BGL1(S) → Z × BGL1(MU).

Here the latter two are the Picard spaces Pic(S) and Pic(MU) [MS, 2.2.1].
Passing through an inﬁnite loop space machine, we obtain a sequence of maps
of spectra

ku → pic(S) → pic(MU),

where ku is the connective complex K-theory spectrum. The universal prop-

3

erty of MU can then be rephrased: the spectrum MU is universal among
E∞ ring spectra E equipped with a coherently commutative diagram

ku

pic(S)

HZ

/ pic(E).

(More concretely, this asks for a map HZ → pic(E) and a chosen homotopy
between the two composites.)

This allows us to exploit Arone–Lesh’s sequence of spectra interpolating be-
tween ku and HZ, giving us an inductive sequence of obstructions to E∞
orientations.

Theorem 1. There exists a ﬁltration of MU by E∞ Thom spectra

S → MX1 → MX2 → MX3 → · · · → MU

with the following properties.

1. The map hocolim MXi → MU is an equivalence.

2. There is a canonical complex orientation of MX1 such that, for all E∞
ring spectra E, the space MapE∞(MX1, E) is homotopy equivalent to
the space of ordinary complex orientations of E.

3. For all m > 0 and all maps of E∞ ring spectra MXm−1 → E, the space
of extensions to a map of E∞ ring spectra MXm → E is a homotopy
pullback diagram of the form

MapE∞(MXm, E)

MapE∞(MXm−1, E)

{∗}

/ Map∗(Fm, Pic(E))

for a certain ﬁxed space Fm, where Pic(E) is the classifying space of
the category of smash-invertible E-modules.

More speciﬁcally, given an E∞ map MXm−1 → E, there is an E-
module Thom spectrum MEξ classiﬁed by a map ξ : Fm → Pic(E). An
extension to an E∞ map MXm → E exists if and only if there is an
orientation MEf → E ∧ S2m in the sense of [ABG+], and the space of
extensions is naturally equivalent to the space Or(ξ) of orientations.

4. The map MXm−1 → MXm is a rational equivalence if m > 1, a p-local
equivalence if m is not a power of p, and a K(n)-local equivalence if
m > pn.

(In particular, the spectrum MX1 will be a universal complex oriented E∞
ring spectrum described by Baker–Richter [BR].)

The spaces Fm are explicitly described by [AL07] as being derived orbit spec-
U (m)S2m. Here Lm is the nerve of the (topologized) poset of proper
tra (Lm)⋄∧L
direct-sum decompositions of Cm, S2m is the one-point compactiﬁcation of
Cm, and ⋄ denotes unreduced suspension. Alternatively, the space Fm can
be described as the homotopy coﬁber of the map of Thom spaces

(Lm ×U (m) EU(m))γm → BU(m)γm

for the universal bundle γm.

In the particular case of an E(1)-local E∞ ring spectrum E, such as a form
of K-theory [LN14, Appendix A], this will allows us to verify that Ando’s
criterion is both necessary and suﬃcient if E ∗ is torsion-free. At higher
chromatic levels there are expected to be secondary and higher obstructions
involving relations between power operations.
Remark 2. Rognes had previously constructed a similar ﬁltration on algebraic
K-theory spectra [Rog92], further examined in the case of complex K-theory
in [AL10]. This ﬁltration gives rise to a sequence of spectra interpolating
the map ∗ → ku rather than ku → HZ. On taking Thom spectra of the
resulting inﬁnite loop maps to Z × BU, the result should be a construction of
the periodic complex bordism spectrum MUP with very similar properties
but slightly diﬀerent subquotients, relevant to a more rigid orientation theory
for 2-periodic spectra.

The authors would like to thank Greg Arone for discussions related to this
material.

1 The ﬁltration of connective K-theory

In this section, we will give short background on the results that we require
from [AL07, 3.8,9.5,9.7,11.3].

Proposition 3. There exists a sequence of maps of E∞-spaces

B0 → B1 → B2 → B3 → · · ·

with the following properties.

1. The space B∞ = hocolim Bm is equivalent to the discrete E∞-space N,

and the induced maps π0Bm → N are isomorphisms.

2. The space B0 is the nerve ` BU(n) of a skeleton of the category of

ﬁnite-dimensional vector spaces and isomorphisms, with the E∞ struc-
ture induced by direct sum.

3. Let P denote the free E∞-space functor. For each m > 0, there is a

homotopy pushout diagram of E∞-spaces

P(Fm)

Bm−1

P(∗)

/ Bm,

where Fm is the path component of Bm−1 mapping to m ∈ N.

4. The map Fm → ∗ is an isomorphism in rational homology if m > 1,
an isomorphism in p-local homology if m is not a power of p, and an
isomorphism in K(n)-homology if m > pn.

The explicit description allows analysis of the ﬁltration quotients. The space

F1 is the path component BU(1) ⊂ ` BU(n). We then get a homotopy

Arone–Lesh then apply an inﬁnite loop space machine to the sequence of

Corollary 4. There exists a sequence of connective spectra

b0 → b1 → b2 → b3 → · · ·

(3)

with the following properties.

1. The spectrum b∞ = hocolim bm is equivalent to the spectrum HZ, and

the induced maps π0bn → Z are isomorphisms.

2. The spectrum b0 is the complex K-theory spectrum ku.

3. For each m > 0, there is a homotopy pushout diagram

4. The map bm−1 → bm is an isomorphism in rational homology if m > 1,
an isomorphism in p-local homology if m is not a power of p, and an
isomorphism in K(n)-homology if m > pn.

2 The ﬁltration of BU

Deﬁnition 5. For each m ≥ 0, let xm be the homotopy ﬁber hoﬁb(ku → bm)
of the maps from equation (3), and let Xm = Ω∞xm.

This gives rise to a sequence of maps

(5)

with homotopy colimit bu ≃ Σ2ku by Bott periodicity. For each m > 0,
diagram (4) implies that the homotopy ﬁber of xm−1 → xm is equivalent to
the reduced suspension spectrum Σ∞Fm.

Applying Ω∞ to the ﬁltration of equation (5), we obtain a ﬁltration of BU
by inﬁnite loop spaces:

∗ → X1 → X2 → X3 → · · ·

(6)

The homotopy ﬁber of Xm−1 → Xm is the space QFm = Ω∞Σ∞Fm.

Proposition 6. The natural map QFm → ∗ is a rational homology equiva-
lence for m > 1, a p-local equivalence for m not a power of p, and a K(n)-local
equivalence if m > pn.

Proof. These properties have already been demonstrated for Fm. The Snaith
splitting [Sna74]

Σ∞(QX)+ ≃ _

(Σ∞X ∧ n)hΣn

then implies that the same is true after applying Q.

3 Decomposition of M U

Deﬁnition 7. For each m ≥ 0, let MXm be the Thom spectrum of the
inﬁnite loop map Xm → BU.

From the sequence (6) of inﬁnite loop spaces over BU, we obtain a ﬁltration
of MU by E∞ ring spectra:

S → MX1 → MX2 → MX3 → · · ·

(7)

Proposition 8. For any associative MU-algebra E such that QFm → ∗ is
an E∗-isomorphism, the map MXm−1 → MXm induces an isomorphism in
E-homology.

Proof. After smashing with MU, the Thom diagonal makes the sequence of
equation (7) equivalent to the sequence of MU-algebras

MU → MU[X1] → MU[X2] → · · · → MU[BU],

where for an E∞ space M we deﬁne MU[M] to be E∞ ring spectrum MU ∧ M+.

The ﬁber sequence QFm → Xm−1 → Xm of E∞ spaces implies that there are
equivalences

MU

∧

(MU ∧ MXm−1) ≃ MU ∧ MXm.

M U [QFm]

Smashing this identiﬁcation over MU with E translates this into an identity

E ∧

E[QFm]

(E ∧ MXm−1) ≃ E ∧ MXm.

Since the natural map E → E[QFm] is an equivalence by assumption, the
result follows.

By work of Lazarev [Laz01], we can apply this in the case where E is a
Morava K-theory. Combined with Proposition 6, this gives the following
result.

Corollary 9. The map MXm−1 → MXm is a rational equivalence for m > 1,
a p-local equivalence for m not a power of p, and a K(n)-local equivalence if
m > pn.

In particular, we have the following equivalences:

(MX1)Q ≃ MUQ

LK(n)MXpn ≃ LK(n)MU
LE(n)MXpn ≃ LE(n)MU

4 Picard groups

As described in the introduction, for an E∞ ring spectrum E we let Pic(E)
be the nerve of the symmetric monoidal category of smash-invertible E-
modules and weak equivalences [HMS94, MS]. The symmetric monoidal

9

structure makes Pic(E) into a grouplike E∞ space, and we write pic(E) for
the associated spectrum. The 0-connected cover of pic(E) is bgl1(E).

As in [ABG+], a map ξ : X → Pic(E) over the path component of an in-
vertible E-module Eζ parametrizes families of E-modules over X with ﬁbers
equivalent to Eζ, and there is an associated E-module Thom spectrum MEξ.
(Technically, to apply the results of [ABG+] we ﬁrst need to smash with the
element E −ζ ∈ π0Pic(E) to move the target to BGL1(E).)

The functor sending a complex vector space to the suspension spectrum of its

one-point compactiﬁcation gives a map of E∞ spaces ` BU(m) → Pic(S),

and the associated map of spectra is a map ku → pic(S).

The space MapE∞(MXm, E) is naturally equivalent to the space of nullhomo-
topies of the composite map xm → bu → bgl1(E) [AHR, ABG+]. However,
the spectra xm are 0-connected, so this is equivalent to the space of extensions
in the diagram

ku

/ pic(S)

bm

/ pic(E).

If we have already ﬁxed an extension bm−1 → pic(E), the pushout diagram (4)
expresses the space of compatible extensions to bm as the space of commuta-
tive diagrams

Fm

Bm−1

(8)

CFm

/ Pic(E).

We write ξ for the diagonal composite Fm → Pic(E) in this diagram.

Proposition 10. Given an extension of ku → pic(E) to a map bm−1 →
pic(E), the space of extensions to a map bm → pic(E) is equivalent to the
space Or(ξ) of orientations of the E-module Thom spectrum MEξ over Fm.

Proof. We must show that the space of homotopies from ξ to a constant
map is equivalent to the space Or(ξ) of orientations: maps of E-modules
MEξ → E ∧ S2m which restrict to an equivalence on Thom spectra at each
point.

In our case, we may choose a basepoint ∗ ∈ BU(m) classifying the vector
bundle Cm → ∗, whose image ∗ → Fm → Pic(E) corresponds to the E-
module E ∧ S2m. We construct the following diagram of pullback squares.

Or(ξ)

{ξ}

Map∗(CFm, Pic(E))

Map∗(Fm, Pic(E))

{E ∧ S2m}

Map(CFm, Pic(E))

/ Map(Fm, Pic(E))

/ Map(∗, Pic(E))

Here the bottom map, of necessity, lands in the path component of the E-
module E ∧ S2m, and the upper-left pullback is the space Or(ξ) because
Fm is connected. Therefore, given this map ξ : Fm → Pic(E), the space of
extensions is equivalent to the space of orientations of the E-module Thom
spectrum MEξ.

5 Orientation towers

The space of E∞ orientations MU → E can now be expressed as the homo-
topy limit of the tower

· · · → MapE∞(MX3, E) → MapE∞(MX2, E) → MapE∞(MX1, E) → ∗.

The description of the space of extension diagrams from equation (8) is equiv-
alent to a homotopy pullback square

MapE∞(MXm, E)

MapE∞(MXm−1, E)

{∗}

E∧S 2m

/ Map∗(Fm, Pic(E)),

where the bottom arrow classiﬁes a constant map to the component of E∧S2m
in Pic(E). The space of lifts is the space of orientations of the Thom spectrum
on Fm, and so the unique obstruction to a lifting is the existence of a Thom
class.

When m = 1, the space MapE∞(MX1, E) is the space of orientations of the
Thom spectrum classiﬁed by the composite

BU(1) → a BU(n) → Pic(E).

More speciﬁcally, the Thom spectrum of this composite is E ∧ MU(1) ≃ E ∧
BU(1). Orientations of this are classical complex orientations: the space of
orientations of this Thom spectrum is the space of maps of E-modules c1 : E∧
BU(1) → E ∧ S2 which restrict to the identity map of E ∧ S2. Therefore,
MapE∞(MX1, E) is naturally the space of ordinary complex orientations of
E.

6 Symmetric power operations

In order to study orientations p-local orientations by MXp, we will need to
recall the construction of power operations.

Associated to a complex vector bundle ξ → X, we have the Thom space
T h(ξ). This is functorial in maps of vector bundles which are ﬁberwise
injections, and for the exterior Whitney sum ⊞ there is a natural isomorphism

T h(ξ ⊞ ξ′) ∼= T h(ξ) ∧ T h(ξ′)

that is part of a strong monoidal structure on T h.

Deﬁnition 11. We deﬁne the following symmetric power functors:

m(X) = (X ×m)hΣm
P×
m(X) = (X ∧m)hΣm
P∧
m (X) = (X ∧E m)hΣm
P∧E

for X a space.
for X a based space.
for X an E-module.

For any of the symmetric monoidal structures ? above, we will write

D?

m : X ?m → P?

m(X)

and

m(X ? Y ) → P?
for the associated natural transformations.

m : P?

∆?

m(X) ? P?

m(Y )

map P×

m(X), and we have a pullback diagram of vector bundles

m(ξ) → P×

Proposition 12. There are natural isomorphisms:

T h(P×
E ∧ T h(ξ) ∼= ME(ξ)
E ∧ P∧

m(Y ) ∼= P∧E

mT h(ξ)

m (E ∧ Y )

Deﬁnition 13. Suppose E has a chosen complex orientation u, and let ε be
the trivial complex vector bundle over a point. We write

tu(ξ) : MEξ → ME(εdim(ξ))

for the natural E-module complex orientation.

The map tu(ε) is the identity map of ME(ε) ∼= E ∧ S2, and tu(γ1) = c1 for
the tautological bundle γ1 → BU(1). Orientations commute with exterior
sum: the strong monoidal structure of T h gives us an identiﬁcation

tu(ξ ⊞ ξ′) ∼= tu(ξ) ∧E tu(ξ′).

Naturality of these orientations in pullback diagrams holds:
f : X → Y and vector bundle ξ → Y we have

for any map

tu(f ∗ξ) = tu(ξ) ◦ ME(f ).

In particular, this implies that tu(ξ ⊞m) = tu(P×

mξ) ◦ ME(D×

m).

7 Power operations

Assume that p is a ﬁxed prime and E is an E∞ ring spectrum with a chosen
complex orientation u. In this section we will recall power operations on even-
degree cohomology classes [Rez]; in the case E = MU these were constructed
by tom Dieck and Quillen, and used by Ando in his characterization of H∞
structures [And00].

Deﬁnition 17. For an E-module spectrum M, we deﬁne

Pu : [M, E ∧ S2k]E → [P∧E

p M, E ∧ S2pk]E

by the formula Pu(α) = tu(ρ⊕k) ◦ P∧E

p (α).

These power operations satisfy the multiplication formula

Pu(α ∧E β) ◦ ∆∧E

p = Pu(α) ∧E Pu(β).

They also depend on u, except when k = 0 where they agree with the ordinary
extended power construction.

Remark 18. While the formula for the power operations is given using even
spheres, it implicitly relies on a ﬁxed identiﬁcation of S2k with the one-point
compactiﬁcation of a complex vector space.

14

Deﬁnition 19. For a complex vector bundle ξ → X, let j : BΣp × X →
P×
p (X) be the diagonal, and let ρ ⊠ ξ → BΣp × X be the external tensor
vector bundle j ∗P×

p (ξ). We deﬁne

Pu : E2k(T h(ξ)) → E2pk(T h(ρ ⊠ ξ))

by the formula Pu(α) = Pu(α) ◦ ME(j).

Deﬁnition 20. For a p-local, complex orientable multiplicative cohomology
theory F , the transfer ideal Itr ⊂ F ∗(BΣp) is the image of the transfer map
F ∗ → F ∗(BΣp), generated by the image of 1 under the transfer. For any Y
equipped with a chosen map to BΣp, we also write Itr for the ideal of F ∗(Y )
generated by the image of Itr.

The natural transformations Pu are multiplicative but not additive, instead
satisfying a Cartan formula. The terms in the Cartan formula which obstruct
additivity are transfers from the cohomology of proper subgroups of the form
Σk × Σp−k ⊂ Σp. If E is p-local, the mixed terms in the Cartan formula are
contained inside Itr · E2pk(T h(ρ ⊠ ξ)).

Proposition 21. There are natural ring homomorphisms

Ψu : E2k(T h(ξ)) → E2pk(T h(ρ ⊠ ξ))/Itr

which are multiplicative and take Thom classes to Thom classes.

8 Cohomology calculations

In this section, we ﬁx a p-local, complex orientable multiplicative cohomology
theory F . Choosing a complex orientation of F , we use G to denote the as-
sociated formal group law over F ∗, and [n]G(x) the power series representing
the associated n-fold sum (x +G x +G · · · +G x).

Proposition 22. The restriction map

F ∗(B(Σp ≀ U(1))) → F ∗(BU(1)p) × F ∗(BΣp × BU(1))

is injective.

15

Proof. Writing B(Σp × U(1)) → B(Σp ≀ U(1)) as a map of homotopy orbit
spaces BU(1)hΣp → (BU(1)p)hΣp, we obtain a diagram of function spectra

F (B(Σp ≀ U(1)), F ) ∼ /

F (BU(1)p, F )hΣp

F (B(Σp × U(1)), F ) ∼

/ F (BU(1), F )hΣp.

Therefore, the map on cohomology is the abutment of a map of homotopy
ﬁxed-point spectral sequences:

H s(Σp, F t(BU(1)p))

F t+s(B(Σp ≀ U(1)))

H s(Σp, F t(BU(1)))

3 F t+s(B(Σp × U(1)))

The composite F ∗(BU(p)) → F ∗(B(Σp ≀ U(1))) → F ∗(BU(1)p)Σp is an iso-
morphism. The latter map is the edge morphism in the above spectral se-
quence, and so the line s = 0 consists of permanent cycles.
As a module acted on by the group Cp ⊂ Σp, the ring F ∗(BU(1)p) ∼=
F ∗ Jα1, . . . , αpK is a direct sum of two submodules: the subring F ∗ JcpK gen-
erated by the monomials (Q αi)k, and a free Cp-module with no higher co-

homology. Therefore, for s > 0 the map

H s(Σp, F ∗ JcpK) → H s(Σp, F ∗(BU(1)p))

is an isomorphism. The composite F ∗ JcpK → F ∗(BU(1)p) → F ∗(BU(1))
induces an injection on cohomology. The above spectral sequences are, in
positive cohomological degree, the tensor products of this injective map of
groups (which consist of permanent cycles) with the cohomology spectral
sequence for F ∗(BΣp), and so converge to an injective map.

Corollary 23. For any complex vector bundle ξ → B(Σp ≀ U(1)), two Thom
classes for ξ are equivalent if and only if their restrictions to BU(1)p and
BΣp × BU(1) are equivalent.

Proof. The product of the restriction maps on the F -cohomology of Thom
spaces is injective by naturality of the Thom isomorphism.

Proposition 24. If F ∗ is torsion-free, the map

F ∗(BΣp × BU(1)) → F ∗(BU(1)) × F ∗(BΣp × BU(1))/Itr

is injective.

(This is similar to results from [HKR00], though here we do not assume that
the coeﬃcient ring F ∗ is local.)

Proof. The natural K¨unneth isomorphisms on the skeleta CPk ⊂ BU(1) take
the form

F ∗(BΣp × CPk) ∼= F ∗(BΣp) ⊗F ∗ F ∗(CPk).

This inverse system in k also satisﬁes the Mittag–Leﬄer condition, and so
it suﬃces to show that the map F ∗(BΣp) → F ∗ × F ∗(BΣp)/Itr is injective.
As the cyclic group Cp ⊂ BΣp has index relatively prime to p, the left-hand
map is injective in the commutative diagram

F ∗(BΣp)

/ F ∗ × F ∗(BΣp)/Itr

F ∗(BCp)

/ F ∗ × F ∗(BCp)/Itr.

It therefore suﬃces to prove that the bottom map is injective.

As p is not a zero divisor in F ∗, the p-series [p]G(x) is not a zero divi-
sor in F ∗(BU(1)), and so the cohomology ring F ∗(BCp) is the quotient
F ∗ Jc1K /[p]G(c1) [HMS94]. The kernel of the map F ∗(BCp) → F ∗ is gen-
erated by c1, while the transfer ideal is generated by the divided p-series
hpiG(c1) = [p]G(c1)/c1 by naturality of the map MU ∗ → F ∗ [Qui71, 4.2].
The intersection of the ideals (c1) and (hpiG(c1)) in the power series ring
consists of elements g(c1) · hpiG(c1) such that the constant coeﬃcient of g is
annihilated by the constant coeﬃcient p of hpiG(c1). As F ∗ is torsion-free,
this ideal is generated by [p]G(c1).

Corollary 25. For any complex vector bundle ξ → BΣp × BU(1), two ori-
entations for ξ are equivalent if and only if their restrictions to BU(1) are
equal and their images in F ∗(BΣp)/Itr ⊗F ∗(BΣp) F ∗(T h(ξ)) are equal.

9 Orientations by M Xp

In this section, we ﬁx a p-local E∞ ring spectrum E such that E ∗ is torsion-
free, together with a complex orientation u deﬁned by a map MX1 → E.
(We will continue to write G for the associated formal group law.) In this
section we will analyze the obstruction to p-local maps from MXp.

As in Section 5, the space of extensions of the complex orientation to an E∞
ring map MXp → E is the space of orientations of the Thom spectrum over
Fp. The homotopy pushout diagram for Fp from equation (2) expresses the
map Fp → B1 → Pic(E) as a coherently commutative diagram

B(Σp ≀ U(1))

BU(p)

γp

BΣp

ρ

/ Pic(E).

From diagram (1), the map BU(p) → Pic(E) classiﬁes the Thom spectrum
MEγp = E ∧ Mγp associated to the tautological bundle γp of BU(p), while
the map BΣp → Pic(E) classiﬁes the bundle MEρ associated to the regular
representation ρ : Σp → U(p). An orientation of the resulting Thom spec-
trum over Fp exists if and only if there are orientations of MEγp and MEρ
whose restrictions to B(Σp ≀ U(1)) agree.

Proposition 26. There exists an orientation of the Thom spectrum over Fp
if and only if the orientations tu(ρ) and tu(γp) have the same restriction to
B(Σp ≀ U(1)), or equivalently if

tu(ρ) ◦ P∧E

p (γ1) = tu(Pp(γ1)).

Proof. The “if” direction is clear. In the other direction, we start by assuming
that we have some pair of orientations whose restrictions agree.

Any orientation of MEρ is of the form a · tu(ρ) for some a ∈ E0(BΣp)×,
and similarly any orientation of MEγp is of the form b · tu(γp) for some b ∈
E0(BU(p))×. These restrict to a·tu(ρ)◦P∧E
p (γ1) and b·tu(Pp(γ1)) respectively.

By Corollary 16, the restrictions of these orientations to BU(1)p are ǫ(a) ·
tu(γ ⊞p
1 ), where ǫ(a) is the natural restriction of a to (E0)× and

1 ) and b · tu(γ ⊞b

we identify b with its image under the injection E0(BU(p)) → E0(BU(1)p).
Similarly, the restrictions of these orientations to BΣp are a · tu(ρ) and ǫ(b) ·
tu(ρ) respectively.

For these to be equal as needed, both a and b must be in the image of (E0)×
and equal. Changing the orientation by multiplying by a−1 then gives the
desired result.

Combining this with Corollary 16 and Corollary 25, we ﬁnd the following.

Proposition 27. There exists an orientation of the Thom spectrum over Fp
if and only if the orientations tu(ρ) and tu(γp) deﬁne the same generating
class after ﬁrst restricting to BΣp × BU(1) and then tensoring over F ∗(BΣp)
with F ∗(BΣp)/Itr.

We recall for the following that, if E ∗ is torsion-free, we have an isomorphism

E ∗(BΣp) ∼= E ∗(BCp)F×

p = (E ∗ JzK /[p]G(z))F×
p ,

where the action of F×

p is by z 7→ [i]G[z].

Theorem 28. If E is an E∞ ring spectrum such that E ∗ is p-local and
torsion-free, an E∞ orientation MX1 → E extends to an E∞ orientation
MXp → E if and only if the power operation Ψu satisﬁes the Ando criterion:
we must have

Ψu(c1) =

(c1 +G [i]G(z))

p−1Y

in the ring E2pk(T h(ρ ⊠ γ1))/Itr.

i=0

Proof. It is necessary and suﬃcient, by Proposition 27, to know that the
restrictions of tu(ρ) ◦ P∧E
p (γ1) and tu(Pp(γ1)) to this target ring are equal. By
deﬁnition, the former restricts to Ψu(tuγ1) = Ψu(c1). The latter restricts to
tu(ρ ⊠ γ1), and so this formula for the Thom class follows from the splitting
principle.
