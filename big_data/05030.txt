ABSTRACT

The purpose of this paper is to revisit the Bianchi identities existing for the Riemann and Weyl
tensors in the combined framework of the formal theory of systems of partial diﬀerential equations
(Spencer cohomology, diﬀerential systems, formal integrability) and Algebraic Analysis (homolog-
ical algebra, diﬀerential modules, duality). In particular, we prove that the n2(n2 − 1)(n − 2)/24
generating Bianchi identities for the Riemann tensor are ﬁrst order and can be easily described by
means of the Spencer cohomology of the ﬁrst order Killing symbol in arbitrary dimension n ≥ 2.
Similarly, the n(n2 − 1)(n + 2)(n − 4)/24 generating Bianchi identities for the Weyl tensor are ﬁrst
order and can be easily described by means of the Spencer cohomology of the ﬁrst order conformal
Killing symbol in arbitrary dimension n ≥ 5. As a most surprising result, the 9 generating Bianchi
identities for the Weyl tensor are of second order in dimension n = 4 while the analogue of the Weyl
tensor has 5 components of third order in the metric with 3 ﬁrst order generating Bianchi identi-
ties in dimension n = 3. The above results, which could not be obtained otherwise, are valid for
any non-degenerate metric of constant riemannian curvature and do not depend on any conformal
factor. They are checked in an Appendix produced by Alban Quadrat (INRIA, Lille) by means of
computer algebra. We ﬁnally explain why the work of Lanczos and followers is not coherent with
these results and must therefore be also revisited.

KEY WORDS: Riemann tensor; Weyl tensor; Bianchi identities, Spencer cohomology, Vessiot

conditions; Lanczos tensor.

1) INTRODUCTION

The language of diﬀerential modules has been recently introduced in applications as a way to
understand the structural properties of systems of partial diﬀerential equations and the Poincar´e
duality between geometry and physics by using adjoint operators or variational calculus with diﬀer-
ential constraints ([2],[23],[38]). In order to explain brieﬂy the ideas of Lanczos as a way to justify
the title of this paper, let us revisit brieﬂy the foundation of n-dimensional elasticity theory as it can
be found today in any textbook. If x = (x1, ..., xn) is a point in space and ξ = (ξ1(x), ..., ξn(x)) is
the displacement vector, lowering the indices by means of the Euclidean metric, we may introduce
the ”small” deformation tensor ǫ = (ǫij = ǫji = (1/2)(∂iξj + ∂jξi)) with n(n + 1)/2 (independent)
components (ǫi≤j ). If we study a part of a deformed body by means of a variational principle, we
may introduce the local density of free energy ϕ(ǫ) = ϕ(ǫij |i ≤ j) and vary the total free energy

Φ =R ϕ(ǫ)dx with dx = dx1 ∧ ... ∧ dxn by introducing σij = ∂ϕ/∂ǫij for i ≤ j and ”deciding” to de-

ﬁne the stress tensor σ by a symmetric matrix with σij = σji in a purely artiﬁcial way within such
a variational principle. Indeed, the usual Cauchy Tetrahedron device (1828) assumes that each
element of a boundary surface is acted on by a surface density of force ~σ with a linear dependence
~σ = (σir(x)nr) on the outward normal unit vector ~n = (nr) and does not make any assumption
on the stress tensor. It is only by an equilibrium of forces and couples, namely the well known

1

phenomenological static torsor equilibrium, that one can prove the symmetry of σ. However, if we

assume this symmetry, we may now consider the summation δΦ =R σij δǫijdx =R σir∂rδξidx. An
integration by parts and a change of sign produce the integral R (∂rσir)δξidx leading to the stress

equations ∂rσir = 0. This classical approach to elasticity theory, based on invariant theory with
respect to the group of rigid motions, cannot therefore describe equilibrium of torsors by means
of a variational principle where the proper torsor concept is totally lacking. It is however widely
used through the technique of ” ﬁnite elements ” where it can also be applied to electromagnetism
(EM) with similar quadratic (piezoelectricity) or cubic (photoelasticity) lagrangian integrals. In
this situation, the 4-potential A of EM is used in place of ξ while the EM ﬁeld dA = F = ( ~B, ~E)
is used in place of ǫ.

However, there exists another equivalent procedure dealing with a variational calculus with
constraint.
Indeed, as we shall see later on, the deformation tensor is not any symmetric ten-
sor as it must satisfy n2(n2 − 1)/12 Riemann compatibility conditions (CC), that is the only
In this case, introducing the Lagrange
condition ∂22ǫ11 + ∂11ǫ22 − 2∂12ǫ12 = 0 when n = 2.

multiplier λ, we have to vary the new integral R [ϕ(ǫ) + λ(∂22ǫ11 + ∂11ǫ22 − 2∂12ǫ12)]dx for an

arbitrary ǫ. Setting λ = −φ, a double integration by parts now provides the parametrization
σ11 = ∂22φ, σ12 = σ21 = −∂12φ, σ22 = ∂11φ of the stress equations by means of the Airy function
φ and the formal adjoint of the Riemann CC ([1],[26]). The same variational calculus with con-
straint may thus also be used in order to avoid the introduction of the EM potential A by using
the Maxwell equations dF = 0 in place of the Riemann CC for ǫ but, in all these situations, we
have to eliminate the Lagrange multipliers or use them as potentials.

In arbitrary dimension, the above compatibility conditions are nothing else but the linearized
Riemann tensor in Riemannian geometry, a crucial mathematical tool in the theory of general
relativity and a good reason for studying the work of Cornelius Lanczos (1893-1974) as it can be
found in ([14],[15]) or in a few modern references ([5],[6],[7],[18],[36]). The starting point of Lanczos
has been to take EM as a model in order to introduce a Lagrangian that should be quadratic in
i,rj = ρji ⇒ ρ = ωijρij ) while considering it independently
the Riemann tensor (ρk
of its expression through the second order derivatives of a metric (ωij ) with inverse (ωij ) or the
ﬁrst order derivatives of the corresponding Christoﬀel symbols (γk
ij ). According to the previous
paragraph, the corresponding variational calculus must involve PD constraints made by the Bianchi
identities and the new lagrangian to vary must therefore contain as many Lagrange multipliers as
the number of generating Bianchi identities that can be written under the form:

l,ij ⇒ ρij = ρr

∇rρk

l,ij = ∇iρlj − ∇jρli

l,ij + ∇iρk

l,jr + ∇jρk

l,ri = 0 ⇒ ∇rρr

Meanwhile, Lanczos and followers have been looking for a kind of ”parametrization ” by using
the corresponding ”Lanczos potential ”, exactly like the Lagrange multiplier has been used as an
Airy potential for the stress equations. However, we shall prove that the deﬁnition of a Riemann
candidate cannot be done without the knowledge of the Spencer cohomology. Moreover, we have
pointed out the existence of well known couplings between elasticity and electromagnetism, namely
piezoelectricity and photoelasticity, which are showing that, in the respective Lagrangians, the EM
ﬁeld is on equal footing with the deformation tensor and not with the Riemann tensor. The shift
by one step backwards that must be used in the physical interpretation of the diﬀerential sequences
involved cannot therefore be avoided. Meanwhile, the ordinary derivatives ∂i can be used in place
of the covariant derivatives ∇i when dealing with the linearized framework as the Christoﬀel sym-
bols vanish when Euclidean or Minkowskian metrics are used.

The next tentative of Lanczos has been to extend his approach to the Weyl tensor:

l,ij = ρk
τ k

l,ij −

1

(n − 2)

(δk

i ρlj − δk

j ρli + ωljωksρsi − ωliωksρsj ) +

1

(n − 1)(n − 2)

(δk

i ωlj − δk

j ωli)ρ

The main problem is now that the Spencer cohomology of the symbols of the conformal Killing
equations, in particular the 2-acyclicity, will be absolutely needed in order to provide the Weyl
tensor and its relation with the Riemann tensor. It will follow that the CC for the Weyl tensor
may not be ﬁrst order contrary to the CC for the Riemann tensor made by the Bianchi identities,

2

another reason for justifying the shift by one step already quoted. In order to provide an idea of
the diﬃculty involved, let us deﬁne the following tensors:

Schouten = (σij = ρij −

1

2(n − 1)

ωijρ) ⇒ Cotton = (σk,ij = ∇iσkj − ∇jσki)

An elementary but tedious computation allows to prove the formula:

∇rτ r

k,ij =

(n − 3)
(n − 2)

σk,ij

Then, of course, if Einstein equations in vacuum are valid, the Schouten and Cotton tensors vanish
but the left member is by no way a diﬀerential identity for the Weyl tensor and great care must be
taken when mixing up mathematics with physics.

The author thanks Prof. Lars Andersson (Einstein Institute, Postdam) for having suggested
him to study the Lanczos potential within this new framework and Alban Quadrat (INRIA, Lille),
a specialist of control theory and computer algebra, for having spent time checking directly in an
Appendix the many striking results contained in this paper.

2) HOMOLOGICAL ALGEBRA

We now need a few deﬁnitions and results from homological algebra ([3],[9],[17],[23],[37]). In the
following two classical theorems, A, B, C, D, K, L, M, N, Q, R, S, T will be modules over a ring A or
vector spaces over a ﬁeld k and the linear maps are making the diagrams commutative. We start
recalling the well known Cramer’s rule for linear systems through the exactness of the ker/coker
sequence for modules. When f : M → N is a linear map (homomorphism), we introduce the
so-called ker/coker long exact sequence:

0 −→ ker(f ) −→ M

f

−→ N −→ coker(f ) −→ 0

In the case of vector spaces over a ﬁeld k, we successively have rk(f ) = dim(im(f )), dim(ker(f )) =
dim(M ) − rk(f ) and dim(coker(f )) = dim(N ) − rk(f ) is the proper number of compatibility
conditions. We obtain by substraction:

dim(ker(f )) − dim(M ) + dim(N ) − dim(coker(f )) = 0

In the case of modules, we may replace the dimension by the rank with rkA(M ) = r when F ≃ Ar
is the greatest free submodule of M and obtain the same relations because of the additive property
of the rank ([23],[24],[33]). The following theorems will be crucially used through the whole paper:

SNAKE THEOREM 2.1: When one has the following commutative diagram resulting from
the two central vertical short exact sequences by exhibiting the three corresponding horizontal
ker/coker exact sequences:

then there exists a connecting map M −→ Q both with a long exact sequence:

0 −→ K −→ L −→ M −→ Q −→ R −→ S −→ 0.

3

Proof: We construct the connecting map by using the following succession of elements:

a′ −→ q

· · ·

a
...
↓
b −→ b′
...
0

· · ·

↓
m −→ c

Indeed, starting with m ∈ M , we may identify it with c ∈ C in the kernel of the next horizontal
map. As g is an epimorphism, we may ﬁnd b ∈ B such that c = g(b) and apply the next horizontal
map to get b′ ∈ B′ in the kernel of g′ by the commutativity of the lower square. Accordingly, there
is a unique a′ ∈ A′ such that b′ = f ′(a′) and we may ﬁnally project a′ to q ∈ Q. The map is well
deﬁned because, if we take another lift for c in B, it will diﬀer from b by the image under f of a
certain a ∈ A having zero image in Q by composition. The remaining of the proof is similar. The
above explicit procedure is called ” chase ” and will not be repeated.

Q.E.D.

We may now introduce cohomology theory through the following deﬁnition:

DEFINITION 2.2: If one has a sequence L
−→ N , that is if g ◦ f = 0, then one may
introduce the submodules coboundary = B = im(f ) ⊆ ker(g) = cocycle = Z ⊆ M and deﬁne
the cohomology at M to be the quotient H = Z/B. The sequence is said to be exact at M if
im(f ) = ker(g).

induces an isomorphism between the cohomology at M in the left vertical column and the kernel
of the morphism Q → R in the right vertical column.

Proof: Let us “cut” the preceding diagram along the dotted line. We obtain the following two
commutative and exact diagrams with im(g) = ker(h), im(g′) = ker(h′):

Using the snake theorem, we successively obtain the following long exact sequences:

0 −→ coboundary −→ cocycle −→ ker (Q −→ R) −→ 0

Q.E.D.

We ﬁnally quote for a later use:

PROPOSITION 2.4: If one has a short exact sequence:

0 −→ M ′

f

−→ M

g

−→ M ′′ −→ 0

then the following conditions are equivalent:
• There exists an epimorphism u : M → M ′ such that u ◦ f = idM ′ (left inverse of f ).
• There exists a monomorphism v : M ′′ → M such that g ◦ v = idM ′′ (right inverse of g).

DEFINITION 2.5: In the above situation, we say that the short exact sequence splits. The
relation f ◦ u + v ◦ g = idM provides an isomorphism (u, g) : M → M ′ ⊕ M ′′ with inverse
f + v : M ′ ⊕ M ” → M . The short exact sequence 0 → Z → Q → Q/Z → 0 cannot split over Z.

3) DIFFERENTIAL SYSTEMS

If E is a vector bundle over the base manifold X with projection π and local coordinates
(x, y) = (xi, yk) projecting onto x = (xi) for i = 1, ..., n and k = 1, ..., m, identifying a map
with its graph, a (local) section f : U ⊂ X → E is such that π ◦ f = id on U and we write
yk = f k(x) or simply y = f (x). For any change of local coordinates (x, y) → (¯x = ϕ(x), ¯y = A(x)y)
on E, the change of section is y = f (x) → ¯y = ¯f (¯x) such that ¯f l(ϕ(x) ≡ Al
k(x)f k(x). The
new vector bundle E∗ obtained by changing the transition matrix A to its inverse A−1 is called
the dual vector bundle of E.
In particular, let T be the tangent vector bundle of vector ﬁelds
on X, T ∗ be the cotangent vector bundle of 1-forms on X and SqT ∗ be the vector bundle of
symmetric q-covariant tensors on X. Diﬀerentiating with respect to xi and using new coor-
dinates yk
Introducing a
i
multi-index µ = (µ1, ..., µn) with length | µ |= µ1 + ... + µn and prolonging the procedure up
to order q, we may construct in this way, by patching coordinates, a vector bundle Jq(E) over
X, called the jet bundle of order q with local coordinates (x, yq) = (xi, yk
µ) with 0 ≤| µ |≤ q
and yk
: Jq+r(E) → Jq(E), ∀q, r ≥ 0 and the

0 = yk. We have therefore epimorphisms πq+r

in place of ∂if k(x), we obtain ¯yl

r∂iϕr(x) = Al

short exact sequences 0 → SqT ∗ ⊗ E → Jq(E)
µ + 1i = (µ1, ..., µi−1, µi + 1, µi+1, ..., µn) and deﬁne the operator jq : E → Jq(E) : f → jq(f )
on sections by the local formula jq(f ) : (x) → (∂µf k(x) | 0 ≤| µ |≤ q, k = 1, ..., m). Moreover, a
jet coordinate yk
µ is said to be of class i if µ1 = ... = µi−1 = 0, µi 6= 0. We ﬁnally inroduce the
Spencer operator D : Jq+1(E) → T ∗ ⊗Jq(E) : fq+1 → j1(fq)−fq+1 with (Dfq+1)k
µ+1i.

DEFINITION 3.1: A system of PD equations of order q on E is a vector subbundle Rq ⊂ Jq(E)
locally deﬁned by a constant rank system of linear equations for the jets of order q of the

Its ﬁrst prolongation Rq+1 ⊂ Jq+1(E) will be deﬁned by the equations

The next deﬁnition of formal integrability will be crucial for our purpose.

DEFINITION 3.2: A system Rq is said to be formally integrable if the Rq+r are vector bundles
∀r ≥ 0 (regularity condition) and no new equation of order q + r can be obtained by prolonging
the given PD equations more than r times, ∀r ≥ 0 or, equivalently, we have induced epimorphisms
πq+r+1
: Rq+r+1 → Rq+r, ∀r ≥ 0 allowing to compute ” step by step ” formal power series solutions.
q+r

A formal test ﬁrst sketched by C. Riquier in 1910, has been improved by M. Janet in 1920
([10],[19]) and by E. Cartan in 1945 ([4]), ﬁnally rediscovered in 1965, totally independently, by B.
Buchberger who introduced Gr¨obner bases, using the name of his thesis advisor ([25]). However
all these tentatives have been largely superseded and achieved in an intrinsic way, again totally
independently of the previous approaches, by D.C. Spencer in 1965 ([19],[22],[39]).

DEFINITION 3.3: The family gq+r of vector spaces over X deﬁned by the purely linear equa-
tions aτ µ
µ+ν = 0 for | µ |= q, | ν |= r is called the symbol at order q +r and only depends on gq.

k (x)vk

The following procedure, where one may have to change linearly the independent variables if
necessary, is the key towards the next deﬁnition which is intrinsic even though it must be checked
in a particular coordinate system called δ-regular (See [19],[22],[23] and [39] for more details):

• Equations of class n: Solve the maximum number βn
order q and class n. Then call (x1, ..., xn) multiplicative variables.

• Equations of class i: Solve the maximum number of remaining equations with respect to the
jets of order q and class i. Then call (x1, ..., xi) multiplicative variables and (xi+1, ..., xn) non-
multiplicative variables.

• Remaining equations equations of order ≤ q − 1: Call (x1, ..., xn) non-multiplicative variables.

DEFINITION 3.4: The above multiplicative and non-multiplicative variables can be visualized
respectively by integers and dots in the corresponding Janet board. A system of PD equations is
said to be involutive if its ﬁrst prolongation can be achieved by prolonging its equations only with
respect to the corresponding multiplicative variables. The following numbers are called characters:

αi
q = m(q + n − i − 1)!/((q − 1)!(n − i)!) − βi

q, ∀1 ≤ i ≤ n ⇒ α1

q ≥ ... ≥ αn

q

For an involutive system, (yβn

q +1, ..., ym) can be given arbitrarily.

For an involutive system of order q in the above solved form, we shall use to denote by ypri
the principal jet coordinates, namely the leading terms of the solved equations in the sense of
involution, and any formal derivative of a principal jet coordinate is again a principal jet coor-
dinate. The remaining jet coordinates will be called parametric jet coordinates and denoted by ypar.

PROPOSITION 3.5: Using the Janet board and the deﬁnition of involutivity, we get:

Let now ∧sT ∗ be the vector bundle of s-forms on X with usual bases {dxI = dxi1 ∧ ... ∧ dxis }
where we have set I = (i1 < ... < is). . Moreover, if ξ, η ∈ T are two vector ﬁelds on X, we may

6

deﬁne their bracket [ξ, η] ∈ T by the local formula ([ξ, η])i(x) = ξr(x)∂rηi(x)− ηs(x)∂sξi(x) leading
to the Jacobi identity [ξ, [η, ζ]] + [η, [ζ, ξ]] + [ζ, [ξ, η]] = 0, ∀ξ, η, ζ ∈ T . We may ﬁnally introduce
the exterior derivative d : ∧rT ∗ → ∧r+1T ∗ : ω = ωIdxI → dω = ∂iωIdxi ∧ dxI with d2 = d ◦ d ≡ 0
in the Poincar´e sequence:

∧0T ∗

d−→ ∧1T ∗

d−→ ∧2T ∗

d−→ ...

d−→ ∧nT ∗ −→ 0

In a purely algebraic setting, one has ([19],[22],[23],[24],[39]):

PROPOSITION 3.6: There exists a map δ : ∧sT ∗ ⊗ Sq+1T ∗ ⊗ E → ∧s+1T ∗ ⊗ SqT ∗ ⊗ E which
restricts to δ : ∧sT ∗ ⊗ gq+1 → ∧s+1T ∗ ⊗ gq and δ2 = δ ◦ δ = 0.

Proof: Let us introduce the family of s-forms ω = {ωk

µ = vk

µ,I dxI } and set (δω)k

µ = dxi ∧ ωk

µ+1i .

We obtain at once (δ2ω)k

µ = dxi ∧ dxj ∧ ωk

µ+1i+1j = 0.

The kernel of each δ in the ﬁrst case is equal to the image of the preceding δ but this may no

longer be true in the restricted case and we set (See [22], p 85-88 for more details):

Q.E.D.

q+r(gq) ⊆ Z s

DEFINITION 3.7: We denote by Bs
q+r(gq)
respectively the coboundary space, cocycle space and cohomology space at ∧sT ∗ ⊗ gq+r of the
restricted δ-sequence which only depend on gq and may not be vector bundles. The symbol gq is
said to be s-acyclic if H 1
q+r = 0, ∀r ≥ 0, involutive if it is n-acyclic and ﬁnite type if
gq+r = 0 becomes trivially involutive for r large enough. For a later use, we notice that a symbol
gq is involutive and of ﬁnite type if and only if gq = 0. Finally, SqT ∗ ⊗ E is involutive ∀q ≥ 0 if we
set S0T ∗ ⊗ E = E. We shall prove later on that any symbol gq is 1-acyclc.

CRITERION THEOREM 3.8: If πq+1
gq is 2-acyclic (involutive), then Rq is formally integrable (involutive).

q

: Rq+1 → Rq is an epimorphism of vector bundles and

EXAMPLE 3.9: The system R2 deﬁned by the three PD equations

Φ3 ≡ y33 = 0,

Φ2 ≡ y23 − y11 = 0,

Φ1 ≡ y22 = 0

is homogeneous and thus automatically formally integrable but g2 and g3 are not involutive though
ﬁnite type because g4 = 0 and the sequence 0 → ∧3T ∗ ⊗ g3 → 0 is not exact. Elementary compu-
tations of ranks of matrices shows that the δ-map:

0 → ∧2T ∗ ⊗ g3

δ−→ ∧3T ∗ ⊗ g2 → 0

is a 3 × 3 isomorphism and thus g3 is 2-acyclic with dim(g3) = 1, a crucial intrinsic property
totally absent from any ”old” work and quite more easy to handle than its Koszul dual. We invite
the reader to treat similarly the system y33 − y11 = 0, y23 = 0, y22 − y11 = 0 and compare.

The main use of involution is to construct diﬀerential sequences that are made up by successive
compatibility conditions (CC) of order one. In particular, when Rq is involutive, the diﬀerential

operator D : E
involutive and one has the canonical linear Janet sequence ([22], p 144):

Φ
→ Jq(E)/Rq = F0 of order q with space of solutions Θ ⊂ E is said to be

jq→ Jq(E)

0 −→ Θ −→ E D−→ F0

D1−→ F1

D2−→ ...

Dn−→ Fn −→ 0

where each other operator is ﬁrst order involutive and generates the CC of the preceding one with
the Janet bundles Fr = ∧rT ∗ ⊗ Jq(E)/(∧rT ∗ ⊗ Rq + δ(∧r−1T ∗ ⊗ Sq+1T ∗ ⊗ E)). As the Janet
sequence can be ”cut at any place”, that is can also be constructed anew from any intermediate
operator, the numbering of the Janet bundles has nothing to do with that of the Poincar´e sequence
for the exterior derivative, contrary to what many physicists still believe (n = 3 with D = div pro-
vides the simplest example). Moreover, the ﬁber dimension of the Janet bundles can be computed
at once inductively from the board of multiplicative and non-multiplicative variables that can be

exhibited for D by working out the board for D1 and so on. For this, the number of rows of this
new board is the number of dots appearing in the initial board while the number nb(i) of dots in
the column i just indicates the number of CC of class i for i = 1, ..., n with nb(i) < nb(j), ∀i < j.

MAIN THEOREM 3.10: When Rq ⊂ Jq(E) is not involutive but formally integrable and its
symbol gq becomes 2-acyclic after exactly s prolongations, the generating CC are of order s + 1 (See
[22], Example 6, p 120 and previous Example).

Proof: We may introduce the canonical epimorphism Φ = Jq(E) → Jq(E)/Rq = F0 and denote by
D = Φ ◦ jq : E → F0 the corresponding diﬀerential operator. As before, we may write formally
Φτ (x, yq) ≡ aτ
i for the ﬁrst prolonga-
tion ρ1(Φ) : Jq+1(E) → j1(F0) and so on with ρr(Φ) : Jq+r(E) → Jr(F0) deﬁned by dν Φτ = zτ

with 0 ≤| ν |≤ r. Setting Br = im(ρr(Φ)) ⊆ Jr(F0), we may introduce the canonical epimorphism
Ψ : Js+1(F0) → Js+1(F0)/Bs+1 = F1. Taking into account the formal integrability of Rq (care),
we obtain by composition of jets the following commutative prolongation diagrams ∀r ≥ 1:

An easy chase is showing that gq is always 1-acyclic and that we have an induced monomorphism
0 → hr+s+1 → T ∗ ⊗hr+s. The crucial result that no classical approach could provide is that, when-
ever gq+s is 2-acyclic, then the full right column of the ﬁrst diagram is also exact or, equivalently,
hr+s+1 ⊆ Sr+s+1T ∗ ⊗ F0 is the r-prolongation of the symbol hs+1 ⊆ Ss+1T ∗ ⊗ F0. Using ﬁnally
the second diagram, it follows by induction and a chase that the upper row is exact whenever the
central row is exact, a result achieving the ﬁrst part of the proof.
We may also use an inductive chase in the full diagram, showing directly that the cohomology at
Sr+s+1T ∗ ⊗ F0 of the upper sequence:

0 → gq+r+s+1 → Sq+r+s+1T ∗ ⊗ E

σr+s+1(Φ)

−→ Sr+s+1T ∗ ⊗ F0

σr (Ψ)
−→ SrT ∗ ⊗ F1

is the same as the δ-cohomology of the left column at ∧2T ∗⊗gq+r+s−1 because all the other vertical
δ-sequences are exact.
Finally, starting from the ker/coker long exact sequence allowing to deﬁne Ψ and ending with
F1 while taking into account that the upper symbol row of the prolongation diagram is exact,
we deduce by an inductive chase that the central row is also exact. It follows that Br+s+1 is the
r-prolongation of Bs+1 which is formally integrable because a chase shows that Br+s+1 projects
onto Br+s, ∀r ≥ 1.The case of an involutive symbol can be studied similarly by choosing s = 0
and explains why all the CC operators met in the Janet sequence are ﬁrst order involutive operators.

Q.E.D.

As we shall see through explicit examples, in particular the conformal Killing system, there is
no rule in general in order to decide about the minimum number s′ ≥ 0 such that hs+s′+1 becomes
2-acyclic in order to repeat the above procedure. However, replacing r by s′ + 2 and chasing in
the ﬁrst of the last two diagrams, we have:

COROLLARY 3.11: The symbol hs+s′+1 becomes 2-acyclic whenever the symbol gq+s+s′ be-
comes 3-acyclic.

DEFINITION 3.12: More generally, a diﬀerential sequence is said to be formally exact if each
operator generates the CC of the operator preceding it.

EXAMPLE 3.13: ([16],§38, p 40) The second order system y11 = 0, y13−y2 = 0 is neither formally
integrable nor involutive. Indeed, we get d3y11 − d1(y13 − y2) = y12 and d3y12 − d2(y13 − y2) = y22,
that is to say each ﬁrst and second prolongation does bring a new second order PD equation.
Considering the new system y22 = 0, y12 = 0, y13 − y2 = 0, y11 = 0, the (evident !) permutation
of coordinates (1, 2, 3) → (3, 2, 1) provides the following involutive second order system with one
equation of class 3, 2 equations of class 2 and 1 equation of clas 1:

Φ4 ≡ y33
= 0
Φ3 ≡ y23
= 0
Φ2 ≡ y22
= 0
Φ1 ≡ y13 − y2 = 0

However, keeping only Φ1 and Φ4 while using the fact that d33 commutes with d13 − d2, we get the
formally exact sequence 0 → Θ → 1 → 2 → 1 → 0 which is not a Janet sequence though the Euler-
Poincar´e characteristics vanishes in both cases with 1−4+4−1 = 1−2+1 = 0 ([22], p 159 and [23]).

EXAMPLE 3.14: Coming back to Example 3.9 while intoducing the three second order oper-
ators P = d22, Q = d23 − d11, R = d33 which are commuting between themselves, we have now
q = 2, s = 1 and we obtain the second order CC:

Ψ3 ≡ P Φ2 − QΦ1 = 0,

Ψ2 ≡ RΦ1 − P Φ3 = 0,

Ψ1 = QΦ3 − RΦ2 = 0

Exactly like in the Poincar´e sequence, we ﬁnally get the new second order CC:

P Ψ1 + QΨ2 + RΨ3 = 0

Writing out only the number of respective equations, we obtain the formally exact diﬀerential
sequence with vanishing Euler-Poincar´e characteristics:

0 → Θ → 1 → 3 → 3 → 1 → 0

which is not a Janet sequence. We let the reader check that h2 is not 2-acyclic but that h3 is
2-acyclic and thus s′ = 1 because 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 and g4 = 0 is trivially involutive. A similar
situation will be met with the conformal Killing equations.

We may ﬁnally extend the restriction D : Rq+1 → T ∗ ⊗ Rq of the Spencer operator to:

D : ∧rT ∗ ⊗ Rq+1 → ∧r+1T ∗ ⊗ Rq : α ⊗ fq+1 → dα ⊗ fq + (−1)rα ∧ Dfq+1 ⇒ D2 = D ◦ D ≡ 0

in order to construct the ﬁrst Spencer sequence which is another resolution of Θ because the kernel
of the ﬁrst D is such that fq+1 ∈ Rq+1, Dfq+1 = 0 ⇔ fq+1 = jq+1(f ), f ∈ Θ when q is large
enough. This standard notation for the Spencer operator must not be confused with the same no-
tation used in the next section for the ring of diﬀerential operators but the distinction will always
be pointed out whenever a confusion could exist.

4) DIFFERENTIAL MODULES

Let K be a diﬀerential ﬁeld, that is a ﬁeld containing Q with n commuting derivations
{∂1, ..., ∂n} with ∂i∂j = ∂j∂i = ∂ij, ∀i, j = 1, ..., n such that ∂i(a + b) = ∂ia + ∂ib, ∂i(ab) =
(∂ia)b + a∂ib, ∀a, b ∈ K and ∂i(1/a) = −(1/a2)∂ia, ∀a ∈ K. Using an implicit summation
on multi-indices, we may introduce the (noncommutative) ring of diﬀerential operators D =
K[d1, ..., dn] = K[d] with elements P = aµdµ such that | µ |< ∞ and dia = adi + ∂ia. The
highest value of |µ| with aµ 6= 0 is called the order of the operator P and the ring D with multi-
plication (P, Q) −→ P ◦ Q = P Q is ﬁltred by the order q of the operators. We have the ﬁltration
0 ⊂ K = D0 ⊂ D1 ⊂ ... ⊂ Dq ⊂ ... ⊂ D∞ = D. Moreover, it is clear that D, as an algebra, is
generated by K = D0 and T = D1/D0 with D1 = K ⊕ T if we identify an element ξ = ξidi ∈ T
with the vector ﬁeld ξ = ξi(x)∂i of diﬀerential geometry, but with ξi ∈ K now. It follows that
D = DDD is a bimodule over itself, being at the same time a left D-module DD by the composition
P −→ QP and a right D-module DD by the composition P −→ P Q with DrDs = Dr+s, ∀r, s ≥ 0.

If we introduce diﬀerential indeterminates y = (y1, ..., ym), we may extend diyk

Φτ ≡ aτ µ
µ for τ = 1, ..., p. Therefore, setting Dy1 + ... + Dym =
Dy ≃ Dm and calling I = DΦ ⊂ Dy the diﬀerential module of equations, we obtain by residue
the diﬀerential module or D-module M = Dy/DΦ, denoting the residue of yk
µ when there
can be a confusion. Introducing the two free diﬀerential modules F0 ≃ Dm0, F1 ≃ Dm1 , we obtain
d1−→ F0 → M → 0 of order q when m0 = m, m1 = p and
equivalently the free presentation F1
d1 = D = Φ ◦ jq with (P1, ..., Pp) → (P1, ..., Pp) ◦ D = (Q1, ..., Qm). We shall moreover assume
that D provides a strict morphism, namely that the corresponding system Rq is formally inte-
grable. It follows that M can be endowed with a quotient ﬁltration obtained from that of Dm
which is deﬁned by the order of the jet coordinates yq in Dqy. We have therefore the inductive

limit 0 = M−1 ⊆ M0 ⊆ M1 ⊆ ... ⊆ Mq ⊆ ... ⊆ M∞ = M with diMq ⊆ Mq+1 but it is important
to notice that DrDq = Dq+r ⇒ DrMq = Mq+r, ∀q, r ≥ 0 ⇒ M = DMq, ∀q ≥ 0 in this particular
case. It also follows from noetherian arguments and involution that DrIq = Iq+r, ∀r ≥ 0 though
we have in general only DrIs ⊆ Ir+s, ∀r ≥ 0, ∀s < q. As K ⊂ D, we may introduce the forgetful
functor f or : mod(D) → mod(K) : DM → KM .

More generally, introducing the successive CC as in the preceding section while changing slightly
the numbering of the respective operators, we may ﬁnally obtain the free resolution of M , namely
d1−→ F0 −→ M −→ 0. In actual practice, one must never
the exact sequence
forget that D = Φ ◦ jq acts on the left on column vectors in the operator case and on the right on
row vectors in the module case. Also, with a slight abuse of language, when D = Φ ◦ jq is involu-
tive as in section 3 and thus Rq = ker(Φ) is involutive, one should say that M has an involutive
presentation of order q or that Mq is involutive.

DEFINITION 4.1: Setting P = aµdµ ∈ D ad←→ ad(P ) = (−1)|µ|dµaµ ∈ D, we have ad(ad(P )) =
P and ad(P Q) = ad(Q)ad(P ), ∀P, Q ∈ D. Such a deﬁnition can be extended to any matrix of
operators by using the transposed matrix of adjoint operators and we get:

< λ, Dξ >=< ad(D)λ, ξ > + div (...)

from integration by part, where λ is a row vector of test functions and <> the usual contraction.
We quote the useful formulas [ad(ξ), ad(η)] = ad(ξ)ad(η) − ad(η)ad(ξ) = −ad([ξ, η]), ∀ξ, η ∈ T
(care about the minus sign) and rkD(D) = rkD(ad(D)) as in ([23], p 610-612).

REMARK 4.2: As can be seen from the last two examples of Section 3, when D is involutive, then
q = βn
ad(D) may not be involutive. In the diﬀerential framework, we may set rkD(D) = m − αn
q .
Comparing to similar concepts used in diﬀerential algebra, this number is just the maximum num-
ber of diﬀerentially independent equations to be found in the diﬀerential module I of equations.
Indeed, pointing out that diﬀerential indeterminates in diﬀerential algebra are nothing else than jet
coordinates in diﬀerential geometry and using standard notations, we have K{y} = limq→∞K[yq].
In that case, the diﬀerential ideal I automatically generates a prime diﬀerential ideal p ⊂ K{y}
providing a diﬀerential extension L/K with L = Q(K{y}/p) and diﬀerential transcendence degree
dif f trd(L/K) = αn
q , a result explaining the notations ([12],[22]). Now, from the dimension for-
mulas of Rq+r, we obtain at once rkD(M ) = αn
q and thus rkD(D) = m − rkD(M ) in a coherent
way with any free presentation of M starting with D. However, D acts on the left in diﬀerential
geometry but on the right in the theory of diﬀerential modules. For an operator of order zero, we
recognize the fact that the rank of a matrix is eqal to the rank of the transposed matrix.

PROPOSITION 4.3: If f ∈ aut(X) is a local diﬀeomorphisms on X, we may set x = f −1(y) =
g(y) and we have the identity:

d←− ∧nT ∗ ⊗ T ≃ ∧n−1T ∗ : ∂iAi ←− Ai. Hence,

Having in mind that D is a K-algebra, that K is a left D-module with the standard action
(D, K) −→ K : (P, a) −→ P (a) : (di, a) −→ ∂ia and that D is a bimodule over itself, we have only
two possible constructions leading to the following two deﬁnitions:

DEFINITION 4.4: We may deﬁne the inverse system R = homK(M, K) of M and introduce
Rq = homK(Mq, K) as the inverse system of order q.

DEFINITION 4.5: We may deﬁne the right diﬀerential module M ∗ = homD(M, D) by using
the bimodule structure of D = DDD.

11

THEOREM 4.6: When M and N are left D-modules, then homK(M, N ) and M ⊗KN are left
D-modules. In particular R = homK(M, K) is also a left D-module for the Spencer operator.

Proof: For any f ∈ homK(M, N ), let us deﬁne:

(af )(m) = af (m) = f (am)

∀a ∈ K, ∀m ∈ M

(ξf )(m) = ξf (m) − f (ξm)

∀ξ = ξidi ∈ T, ∀m ∈ M

It is easy to check that ξa = aξ + ξ(a) in the operator sense and that ξη − ηξ = [ξ, η] is the standard
bracket of vector ﬁelds. We have in particular with d in place of any di:

((da)f )(m) = (d(af ))(m) = d(af (m)) − af (dm) = (∂a)f (m) + ad(f (m)) − af (dm)

= (a(df ))(m) + (∂a)f (m)
= ((ad + ∂a)f )(m)

For any m ⊗ n ∈ M ⊗KN with arbitrary m ∈ M and n ∈ N , we may then deﬁne:

a(m ⊗ n) = am ⊗ n = m ⊗ an ∈ M ⊗KN

ξ(m ⊗ n) = ξm ⊗ n + m ⊗ ξn ∈ M ⊗KN

and conclude similarly with:

(da)(m ⊗ n) = d(a(m ⊗ n)) = d(am ⊗ n)

= d(am) ⊗ n + am ⊗ dn
= (∂a)m ⊗ n + a(dm) ⊗ n + am ⊗ dn
= (ad + ∂a)(m ⊗ n)

Using K in place of N , we ﬁnally get (dif )k
the Spencer operator with now Df = dxi ⊗ dif and thus:

µ = (dif )(yk

µ) = ∂if k

µ − f k

µ+1i that is we recognize exactly

(di(dj f ))k

µ = ∂ij f k

µ − (∂if k

In fact, R is the projective limit of πq+r

: Rq+r → Rq in a coherent way with jet theory ([2],[27],[38]).

Q.E.D.

COROLLARY 4.7: If M and N are right D-modules, then homK(M, N ) is a left D-module.
Moreover, if M is a left D-module and N is a right D-module, then M ⊗KN is a right D-module.

Proof: If M and N are right D-modules, we just need to set (ξf )(m) = f (mξ) − f (m)ξ, ∀ξ ∈
T, ∀m ∈ M and conclude as before. Similarly, if M is a left D-module and N is a right D-module,
we just need to set (m ⊗ n)ξ = m ⊗ nξ − ξm ⊗ n.

Q.E.D.

REMARK 4.8: When M = DM ∈ mod(D) and N = ND, , then homK(N, M ) cannot be en-
dowed with any left or right diﬀerential structure. When M = MD and N = ND, then M ⊗KN
cannot be endowed with any left or right diﬀerential structure (See [2], p 24 for more details).

As M ∗ = homD(M, D) is a right D-module, let us deﬁne the right D-module ND by the

ker/coker long exact sequence 0 ←− ND ←− F ∗
1

D∗
←− F ∗

0 ←− M ∗ ←− 0.

COROLLARY 4.9: We have the side changing procedure ND → N = DN = homK(∧nT ∗, ND)
with inverse M = DM → MD = ∧nT ∗⊗KM whenever M, N ∈ mod(D).

Proof: According to the above Theorem, we just need to prove that ∧nT ∗ has a natural right
module structure over D. For this, if α = adx1 ∧ ... ∧ dxn ∈ T ∗ is a volume form with coeﬃcient
a ∈ K, we may set α.P = ad(P )(a)dx1 ∧ ... ∧ dxn when P ∈ D. As D is generated by K and T ,

12

we just need to check that the above formula has an intrinsic meaning for any ξ = ξidi ∈ T . In
that case, we check at once:

α.ξ = −∂i(aξi)dx1 ∧ ... ∧ dxn = −L(ξ)α

by introducing the Lie derivative of α with respect to ξ, along the intrinsic formula L(ξ) = i(ξ)d +
di(ξ) where i() is the interior multiplication and d is the exterior derivative of exterior forms.
According to well known properties of the Lie derivative, we get :

α.(aξ) = (α.ξ).a − α.ξ(a),

α.(ξη − ηξ) = −[L(ξ), L(η)]α = −L([ξ, η])α = α.[ξ, η].

Q.E.D.

Collecting the previous results, if a diﬀerential operator D is given in the framework of diﬀer-
ential geometry, we may keep the same notation D in the framework of diﬀerential modules which
are left modules over the ring D of linear diﬀerential operators and apply duality, provided we use
the notation D∗ and deal with right diﬀerential modules or use the notation ad(D) and deal again
with left diﬀerential modules by using the lef t ↔ right conversion procedure.

DEFINITION 4.10: If an operator ξ D−→ η is given, a direct problem is to look for (generating)
D1−→ ζ such that Dξ = η ⇒ D1η = 0. Conversely,
compatibility conditions (CC) as an operator η
D1−→ ζ, the inverse problem will be to look for ξ D−→ η such that D1 generates the CC of D

given η
and we shall say that D1 is parametrized by D if such an operator D is existing.

As ad(ad(P )) = P, ∀P ∈ D, any operator is the adjoint of a certain operator and we get:

DOUBLE DUALITY CRITERION 4.11: An operator D1 can be parametrized by an oper-
ator D if, whenever ad(D) generates the CC of ad(D1), then D1 generates the CC of D. However,
as shown in the example below, many other parametrizations may exist.

Reversing the arrows, we ﬁnally obtain:

TORSION-FREE CRITERION 4.12: A diﬀerential module M having a ﬁnite free presenta-
D1−→ F0 → M → 0 is torsion-free, that is to say t(M ) = {m ∈ M | ∃0 6= P ∈ D, P m = 0} =
tion F1
D−→ E
0, if and only if there exists a free diﬀerential module E and an exact sequence F1
providing the parametrization M ⊆ E.

D1−→ F0

REMARK 4.13: Of course, solving the direct problem (Janet, Spencer) is necessary for solv-
ing the inverse problem. However, though the direct problem always has a solution, the inverse
problem may not have a solution at all and the case of the Einstein operator is one of the best
non-trivial PD counterexamples ([24],[30]). It is rather striking to discover that, in the case of OD
operators, it took almost 50 years to understand that the possibility to solve the inverse problem
was equivalent to the controllability of the corresponding control system ([24],[34]).

EXAMPLE 4.14: (contact transformations) With n = 3, K = Q(x1, x2, x3), let us consider the
Lie pseudogroup of transfomations preserving the ﬁrst order geometric object ω like a 1-form but
up to the square root of ∆. The inﬁnitesimal transformations are among the solutions Θ of the
general system:

Ωi ≡ (L(ξ)ω)i ≡ ωr(x)∂iξr − (1/2)ωi(x)∂rξr + ξr∂rωi(x) = 0

When ω = (1, −x3, 0), we obtain the special involutive system:

∂3ξ3 + ∂2ξ2 + 2x3∂1ξ2 − ∂1ξ1 = 0, ∂3ξ1 − x3∂3ξ2 = 0, ∂2ξ1 − x3∂2ξ2 + x3∂1ξ1 − (x3)2∂1ξ2 − ξ3 = 0
with 2 equations of class 3, 1 equation of class 2 and thus only 1 ﬁrst order CC for the second
members coming from the linearization of the Vessiot structure equation:

ω1(∂2ω3 − ∂3ω2) + ω2(∂3ω1 − ∂1ω3) + ω3(∂1ω2 − ∂2ω1) = c

13

involving the only structure constant c. This system can be parametrized by a single potential θ:

−x3∂3θ + θ = ξ1, −∂3θ = ξ2, ∂2θ − x3∂1θ = ξ3 ⇒ ξ1 − x3ξ2 = θ

and we have the formally exact diﬀerential sequence 0 → 1

D−1−→ 3 D−→ 3

D1−→ 1 → 0.

However, we have yet not proved the most diﬃcult result that could not be obtained without

homological algebra and the next example will explain ths additional diﬃculty.

EXAMPLE 4.15: With ∂22ξ = η2, ∂12ξ = η1 for D, we get ∂1η2 − ∂2η1 = ζ for D1. Then ad(D1)
is deﬁned by µ2 = −∂1λ, µ1 = ∂2λ while ad(D) is deﬁned by ν = ∂12µ1 + ∂22µ2 but the CC of
ad(D1) are generated by ν′ = ∂1µ1 + ∂2µ2. In the operator framework, we have the diﬀerential
sequences:

ξ

0 ← ν

D−→ η
ad(D)
←− µ

D1−→ ζ → 0
ad(D1)
←− λ

where the upper sequence is formally exact at η but the lower sequence is not formally exact at µ.
Passing to the module framework, we obtain the sequences:

0 → D

D

D1−→ D2
ad(D1)
←− D2

D−→ D → M → 0
ad(D)
←− D ← 0

where the lower sequence is not exact at D2.

Therefore, we have to ﬁnd out situations in which ad(D) generates the CC of ad(D1) whenever

D1 generates the CC of D and conversely. This problem will be studied in Section 5, Part C.

5) APPLICATIONS

Though the next pages will only be concerned with a study of the Lie pseudogroups of isome-
tries (A) and conformal isometries (B), the reader must never forget that they can be used similarly
for any arbitrary transitive Lie pseudogroup of transformations ([19],[21],[22],[29]).

A) RIEMANN TENSOR

i + ωirξr

Let ω = (ωij = ωji) ∈ S2T ∗be a non-degenerate metric with det(ω) 6= 0. We shall apply
the Main Theorem to the ﬁrst order Killing system R1 ⊂ J1(T ) deﬁned by the n(n + 1)/2 linear
j + ξr∂rωij = 0 for any section ξ1 ∈ R1. Its symbol g1 ⊂ T ∗ ⊗ T is
equations Ωij ≡ ωrjξr
deﬁned by the n(n + 1)/2 linear equations ωrjξr
j = 0 and we obtain at once isomorphisms
g1 ≃ ∧2T ≃ ∧2T ∗ by lowering or raising the indices by means of the metric, obtaining for example
ξi,j + ξj,i = 0. As det(ω) 6= 0, we may introduce the well known Chrisoﬀel symbols γ = (γk
ij = γk
ji)
through the standard Ricci/Levi-Civita isomorphism j1(ω) ≃ (ω, γ) and obtain by one prolonga-
tion the linear second order equations for any section ξ2 ∈ R2:

i + ωirξr

Γk
ij ≡ ξk

ij + γk

rjξr

ij = 0

i + γk

ir − γr

ijξk

r + ξr∂rγk

and we have Ω ∈ S2T ∗ ⇒ Γ ∈ S2T ∗ ⊗ T for the respective linearization/variation of ω and γ.
As we shall see that g1 is not 2-acyclic and g2 = 0 is deﬁned by the n2(n + 1)/2 linear equations
ξk
ij = 0, we may apply the Main Theorem with q = 1, s = 1, E = T , on the condition that R1
should be formally integrable as it is ﬁnite type and cannot therefore be involutive. First of all,
we have the following commutative and exact diagram allowing to deﬁne F0 = S2T ∗:

Now, R2

π2
1−→ R1 is an isomorphism because g2 = 0 and dim(R2) = dim(R1) = n(n + 1)/2.

π3
2−→ R2 is also an isomorphism too because
Hence, R2 ⊂ J2(T ) is involutive if and only if R3
g2 = 0 ⇒ g2+r = 0, ∀r ≥ 0. Such a diﬀerential condition for ω has been shown by L.P. Eisen-
hart in ([8]) to be equivalent to the Vessiot structure equation with one constant called constant
riemannian curvature ρk

In this formula, c is an arbitrary constant and the Riemann tensor

l,ij = 0,

l,ij + ρk

j,li = 0

We shall suppose that ω is the Euclidean metric if n = 2, 3 and the Minkowskian metric if n = 4
but any other compatible choice should be convenient. As a next step, we know from the Main
Theorem that the generating CC for the operator Killing = Φ ◦ j1 : T → F0 are made by an opera-
tor Riemann = Ψ◦j2 : F0 → F1 of order s+1 = 2. We shall deﬁne F1 by setting q = 1, r = 0, s = 1
in the corresponding diagram in order to get the following commutative diagram:

where all the rows are exact and all the columns are also exact but the ﬁrst at ∧2T ∗ ⊗ g1
with g2 = 0 ⇒ g3 = 0. We shall denote by B2(g1) the coboundary as the image of the cen-
tral δ, by Z 2(g1) the cocycle as the kernel of the lower δ and by H 2(g1) = Z 2(g1)/B2(g1) the
Spencer δ-cohomology at ∧2T ∗ ⊗ g1 as the quotient. Chasing in the previous diagram, we dis-
cover that the Riemann tensor is a section of the bundle F1 = H 2(g1) = Z 2(g1) with dim(F1) =
(n2(n + 1)2/4) − (n2(n + 1)(n + 2)/6) = (n2(n − 1)2/4) − (n2(n − 1)(n − 2)/6) = n2(n2 − 1)/12
by using the top row or the left column. We discover at once the two properties of the (lin-
l,ij ) ∈ ∧2T ∗ ⊗ T ∗ ⊗ T is killed
earized) Riemann tensor through the chase involved, namely (Rk
by both δ and σ0(Φ). Similarly, going one step further, we get the (linearized) Bianchi identi-
ties by deﬁning the ﬁrst order operator Bianchi : F1 → F2 where F2 = H 3(g1) = Z 3(g1) with
dim(F2) = dim(∧3T ∗ ⊗ g1) − dim(∧4T ∗ ⊗ T ) = n2(n − 1)2(n − 2)/12 − n2(n − 1)(n − 2)(n − 3)/24 =
n2(n2 − 1)(n − 2)/24 may be deﬁned by the following commutative diagram:

This approach is relating for the ﬁrst time the concept of Riemann tensor candidate, introduced
by Lanczos and others, to the Spencer δ-cohomology of the Killing symbols. We obtain therefore
the formally exact sequence:

0 → Θ → n

Killing

−→ n(n + 1)/2 Riemann−→ n2(n2 − 1)/12 Bianchi−→ n2(n2 − 1)(n − 2)/24 → ...

with operators of successive orders 1, 2, 1, ... and so on.
In the present situation, we have the (split) short exact sequences:

0 → F1 → ∧2T ∗ ⊗ g1

δ−→ ∧3T ∗ ⊗ T → 0,

0 → F2 → ∧3T ∗ ⊗ g1

δ→ ∧4T ∗ ⊗ T → 0

and obtain the operator ad(Bianchi) : ∧nT ∗ ⊗ F ∗

2 → ∧nT ∗ ⊗ F ∗

1 with the short exact sequence:

0 ← ∧nT ∗ ⊗ F ∗

2 ← ∧n−3T ∗ ⊗ g∗

1 ← ∧n−2T ∗ ⊗ T ∗ ← 0

explaining at once why the Lagrange multipliers λ ∈ ∧nT ∗ ⊗ F ∗
2 can be represented by a sec-
tion of ∧n−3T ∗ ⊗ ∧2T ∗, that is by a Lanczos potential in T ⊗ ∧2T ∗ when n = 4. We shall
see in part C that ad(Bianchi) is parametrizing ad(Riemann) contrary to the claims of Lanc-
zos. Moreover, we have already pointed out in many books ( [21],[23]) or papers ([28],[32]) that
continuum mechanics may be presented through a variational problem with a diﬀerential con-
straints which is shifted by one step backwards in the previous diﬀerential sequence because the
inﬁnitesimal deformation tensor ǫ = 1
2 Ω ∈ S2T ∗ must be now killed by the operator Riemann
and the corresponding Lagrange multipliers λ ∈ ∧nT ∗ ⊗ F ∗
1 must be used because ad(Riemann)
is parametrizing ad(Killing) = Cauchy. Anybody using computations with ﬁnite elements also
knows that a similar situation is held by electromagnetism too because the EM ﬁeld is killed by
d : ∧2T ∗ → ∧3T ∗ ⇒ ad(d) : ∧1T ∗ → ∧2T ∗, another fact contradicting Lanczos claims.
Finally, the passage to diﬀerential modules can be achieved easily by using K = Q as will be
done in the Appendix or K = Q < ω > with standard notations because the Lie pseudogroup of
isometries is an algebraic Lie pseudogroup as it can be deﬁned by diﬀerential polynomials in the
jets of order ≥ 1 (See [12],[20],[22] for details).

B) WEYL TENSOR

If the study of the Riemann tensor/operator has been related to many classical results, the
study of the Weyl tensor/operator in this new framework is quite diﬀerent because these new
mathematical tools have not been available before 1975 and are still not acknowledged today by
mathematical physicists. In particular, we may quote the link existing between acyclicity and for-
mal integrability both with the possibility to use the Vessiot structure equations in order to combine
in a unique framework the constant riemannian curvature condition needed for the Killing system,
which only depends on one arbitrary constant, with the zero Weyl tensor condition needed for the
conformal Killing system, which does not depend on any constant. For this reason, we shall follow
as closely as possible the previous part A, putting a ”hat” on the corresponding concepts.

16

The conformal Killing system ˆR1 ⊂ J1(T ) is deﬁned by eliminating the function A(x) in the
system L(ξ)ω = A(x)ω. It is also a Lie operator ˆD with solutions ˆΘ ⊂ T satisfying [ ˆΘ, ˆΘ] ⊂ ˆΘ. Its
symbol ˆg1 is deﬁned by the linear equations ωrjξr
r = 0 which do not depend on
any conformal factor and is ﬁnite type because ˆg3 = 0 when n ≥ 3. We have ([19],[20],[32]):

i + ωirξr

n ωij ξr

j − 2

LEMMA 5.1: ˆg2 ⊂ S2T ∗ ⊗ T is now 2-acyclic only when n ≥ 4 and 3-acyclic only when n ≥ 5.

It is known that ˆR2 and thus ˆR1 too (by a chase) are formally integrable if and only if ω has

zero Weyl tensor:

If we use the formula idM − f ◦ u = v ◦ g of Proposition 2.4 in the split short exact sequence induced
by the inclusions g1 ⊂ ˆg1, 0 = g2 ⊂ ˆg2, g3 = ˆg3 = 0 ([21],[22],[28]):

0 −→ Ricci −→ Riemann −→ W eyl −→ 0

according to the Vessiot structure equations, in particular if ω has constant Riemannian curva-
i,rj = c(n − 1)ωij ⇒ ρ = ωijρij = cn(n − 1) ([19],[21],[30],[31]). Using
ture and thus ρij = ρr
the same diagrams as before, we get ˆF0 = T ∗ ⊗ T /ˆg1 with dim( ˆF0) = (n − 1)(n + 2)/2 and
ˆF1 = H 2(ˆg1) 6= Z 2(ˆg1) for deﬁning any Weyl tensor candidate. As a byproduct, we could believe
that the linearized operator W eyl : ˆF0 → ˆF1 is of order 2 with a symbol ˆh2 ⊂ S2T ∗ ⊗ ˆF0 which is
not 2-acyclic by applying the δ-map to the short exact sequence:

0 → ˆg3+r −→ S3+rT ∗ ⊗ T

σ2+r (Φ)
−→ ˆh2+r → 0

and chasing through the commutative diagram thus obtained with r = 0, 1, 2. As ˆh3 becomes
2-acyclic after one prolongation of ˆh2 only, it follows that the generating CC for the Weyl operator
are of order 2, a result showing that the so-called Bianchi identities for the Weyl tensor are not
CC in the strict sense of the deﬁnition as they do not involve only the Weyl tensor.

In fact, things are quite diﬀerent and we have to distinguish three diﬀerent cases:

• n = 3: According to the last Lemma, ˆg2 is not 2-acyclic but ˆg3 = 0 becomes trivially 2-ayclic
and even involutive, that is s = 2. According to the Main Theorem, the operator W eyl : ˆF0 → ˆF1
is third order because s + 1 = 3 (See Appendix) and ˆF1 is deﬁned by the short exact sequences:

0 → S4T ∗ ⊗ T → S3T ∗ ⊗ ˆF0 → ˆF1 → 0,

0 → ˆF1 → ∧2T ∗ ⊗ ˆg2

δ−→ ∧3T ∗ ⊗ ˆg1 → 0

with dim( ˆF1) = 50 − 45 = 9 − 4 = 5. As now ˆh3 ⊂ S3T ∗ ⊗ ˆF0, applying the δ-map to the short
exact sequence:

0 → ˆg6 → S6T ∗ ⊗ T → ˆh5 → 0

and chasing, we discover that ˆh3 is 2-acyclic because ˆg3 = 0. Accordingly, the operator Bianchi :
ˆF1 → ˆF2 is ﬁrst order and ˆF2 is deﬁned by the long exact sequence:

0 → S5T ∗ ⊗ T → S4T ∗ ⊗ ˆF0 → T ∗ ⊗ ˆF1 → ˆF2 → 0

or by the isomorphism 0 → ˆF2 → ∧3T ∗ ⊗ ˆg2 → 0 giving dim( ˆF2) = 63 − 75 + 15 = 1 × 3 = 3.
Recapitulating, when n = 3 we have the formally exact diﬀerential sequence with 3 − 5 + 5 − 3 = 0:

n (δk
In actual practice, introducing the new geometric objects ˆγk

17

• n = 4: This situation is even more striking because ˆg2 is 2 acyclic but not 3-acyclic and thus
s = 1. As before, we have dim( ˆF0) = (n − 1)(n + 2)/2 = 9 but, according to the Main Theo-
rem, the operator W eyl : ˆF0 → ˆF1 is of order s+1 = 2 and ˆF1 is deﬁned by the short exact sequence:

0 → S3T ∗ ⊗ T → S2T ∗ ⊗ ˆF0 → ˆF1 → 0 ⇒ dim( ˆF1) = 90 − 80 = 10

or by ˆF1 = H 2(ˆg1) = Z 2(ˆg1)/B2(ˆg1) with exact sequences:

0 → T ∗ ⊗ ˆg2

δ−→ B2(ˆg1) → 0,

0 → Z 2(ˆg1) → ∧2T ∗ ⊗ ˆg1

δ−→ ∧3T ∗ ⊗ T → 0

providing again dim( ˆF1) = 26 − 16 = 10. The main problem is that,now, ˆg2 is not 3-acyclic and
thus ˆh2 is not 2-acyclic according to a chase in the commutative diagram:

a result showing that H 3(ˆg1) = 0 for n = 4, contrary to what will happen when n ≥ 5.

• n ≥ 5: We still have dim( ˆF0) = (n − 1)(n + 2)/2 but now ˆg2 is 2-acyclic and 3-acyclic with s = 1
again but now with s′ = 0. Hence, according to the Main Theorem and its Corollary, the operator
W eyl is second order while the operator Bianchi is ﬁrst order. We may therefore use the same
diagrams already introduced in part A but with a ”hat ” symbol and n ≥ 4. In particular we get:

dim(Z 3(ˆg1)) = dim(∧3T ∗ ⊗ ˆg1) − dim(∧4T ∗ ⊗ T ) = n(n − 1)(n − 2)(n2 + n + 4)/24

dim(B3(ˆg1)) = n2(n − 1)/2 ⇒ dim(H 3(ˆg1)) = n(n2 − 1)(n + 2)(n − 4)/24

We ﬁnd again H 3(ˆg1) = 0 when n = 4 but H 3(ˆg1) 6= 0 when n ≥ 5, a key step that no classical
technique can even imagine. We have therefore a ﬁrst order operator Bianchi : ˆF1 → ˆF2 with
ˆF1 = H 2(ˆg1) and ˆF2 = H 3(ˆg1) when n ≥ 5. We obtain therefore a formally exact diﬀerential
sequence:

In order to convince the reader about the powerfulness of the previous methods, let us prove
that the generating CC of Bianchi is a second order operator with 14 equations when n = 5.
First, we ask the reader to prove, as an exercise, that H 4(ˆg1) = 0 through the exact δ-sequence
0 → ∧3T ∗ ⊗ ˆg2 → ∧4T ∗ ⊗ ˆg1 → ∧5T ∗ ⊗ T → 0 (Hint: 50 = 55 − 5). Conclude that the gener-
ating CC cannot be of ﬁrst order. Then, prove that dim(H 4(ˆg2)) = 25 − 11 = 14. Finally, prove

19

that the generating CC of these CC is ﬁrst order with 5 equations (Hint: Use the vanishing of
the Euler-Poincar´e characteristic with 5−14+35−35+14−5 = 0) (See Appendix for conﬁrmation).

C) PARAMETRIZATIONS

Let E and F be two vector bundles with respective ﬁber dimensions dim(E) = m and dim(F ) =
p. Starting with a diﬀerential operator D : E → F of order q with solutions Θ ⊂ E and such that
the corresponding system Rq ⊂ Jq(E) is formally integrable, we have explained in Section 3 how
to construct a formally exact diﬀerential sequence:

0 → Θ → E D−→ F0

D1−→ F1

D2−→ F2

D3−→ ...

where F0 = F and each operator Di of order qi generates the CC of the previous one. In particular,
if the starting operator D is involutive, then q1 = ... = qn = 1 and each Di is involutive in the
resulting Janet sequence ﬁnishing at Fn in the sense that Dn is formally surjective. Equivalently,
it is possible to pass to the framework of diﬀerential module and look for a free resolution of a dif-
ferential module M starting with a free ﬁnite presentation Dp D−→ Dm → M → 0 with an operator
acting on the right. In general, we have proved in the last two parts A and B that the succession
of the orders q, q1, q2, q3, ... can be nevertheless quite strange. Meanwhile, we have proved through
examples that many possible ﬁnite length such sequences can be exhibited and the purpose of
Homological Algebra is to study formal properties that should not depend on the sequence used.
At the end od Section 4, we have pointed out the fact that, whenever an operator D1 generates
all the CC of an operator D, this does not imply in general that the operator ad(D) generates all
the CC of ad(D1). The following (quite diﬃcult) theorem is a main result of homological algebra,
adapted to diﬀerential systems and diﬀerential modules ([2],[3],[9],[17],[23],[37]):

THEOREM 5.2: The fact that a formally exact diﬀerential sequence considered as a resolution
of Θ has the property that the adjoint sequence is also formally exact does not depend on the
sequence but only on Θ.

COROLLARY 5.3: The fact that a free resolution of a diﬀerential module M has the property
that the adjoint sequence is also a free resolution does not depend on the sequence but only on M .

Our problem in this part C is to describe a suﬃciently general situation in such a way that
all the results of the parts A and B can ﬁt together, in the sense that we shall no longer need
to use a hat in order to distinguish them. For this, with E = T , let us say that an operator
D = Φ ◦ jq : T → F is a Lie operator if Dξ = 0, Dη = 0 ⇒ D[ξ, η] = 0 that is to say [Θ, Θ] ⊆ Θ.
The corresponding system Rq = ker(Φ) is called a system of inﬁnitesimal Lie equations and one
can deﬁne a ”bracket on sections” satisfying [Rq, Rq] ⊆ Rq in order to check formally the previous
deﬁnition ([19],[29],[30]). It has been found by E. Vessiot, as early as in ... 1903 ([19],[40]), that
the condition of formal integrability of Rq can be described by the Vessiot structure equations, a
set of (non-linear in general) diﬀerential conditions depending on a certain number of constants,
for one or a family of geometric objects that can be vectors, forms, tensors or even higher order
objects. The idea has been to look for ”general” systems or symbols having the same dimensions
as for a model object called ”special”, for example the euclidean metric when n = 2, 3 or the
minkowskian metric when n = 4. The case of part A has been a metric ω with det(ω) 6= 0 and
constant riemannian curvature with one constant while the case of part B has been a metric density
n ) with zero Weyl tensor and no constant involved. The following results will be
ˆω = ω/(| det(ω) |
local.

Let us suppose that we have a Lie group of transformations of X, namely a Lie group G and
an action X × G → X : (x, a) → y = ax = f (x, a) or, better, its graph X × G → X × X : (x, a) →
(x, y = ax = f (x, a). Diﬀerentiating enough times, we may eliminate the parameters a among the
equations yq = jq(f )(x, a) for q large enough and get a (non-linear in general) system of ﬁnite Lie
equations. Linearising this system for a close to the identity e ∈ G, that is for y close to x, provides
the system Rq ⊂ Jq(T ) and the corresponding Lie operator of ﬁnite type. Equivalently, the three
theorems of Sophus Lie assert that there exists a ﬁnite number of inﬁnitesimal generators {θτ } of

20

the action that should be linearly independent over the constants and satisfy [θρ, θσ] = cτ
ρσθτ where
the structure constants c deﬁne a Lie algebra G = Te(G). We have therefore ξ ∈ Θ ⇔ ξ = λτ θτ
with λτ = cst. Hence, we may replace locally the system of inﬁnitesimal Lie equations by the
system ∂iλτ = 0, getting therefore the diﬀerential sequence:

0 → Θ → ∧0T ∗ ⊗ G d−→ ∧1T ∗ ⊗ G d−→ ...

d−→ ∧nT ∗ ⊗ G → 0

which is the tensor product of the Poincar´e sequence by G. Finally, we are in a position to apply
the previous Theorem and Corollary because the Poincar´e sequence is self adjoint (up to sign),
that is ad(d) generates the CC of ad(d) at any position, exactly like d generates the CC of d at any
position. We invite the reader to compare with the situation of the Maxwell equations in electro-
magnetisme. However, we have proved in ([21],[22],[30],[31],[32]) why neither the Janet sequence
nor the Poincar´e sequence can be used in physics and must be replaced by the Spencer sequence
which is another resolution of Θ. We provide a few additional details on the motivations for such
a procedure.

For this, if q is large enough in such a way that gq = 0 and thus Rq+1 ≃ Rq, let us deﬁne locally
τ (x) and apply the Spencer operator
τ , a result proving that the previous

a section ξq+1 ∈ Rq+1 by the formula ξk
D. We obtain at once (Dξq+1)k
µ,i = ∂iξk
sequence is (locally) isomorphic to the Spencer sequence:

µ+1i = λτ (x)∂µ+1i θk
µ+1i = ∂iλτ ∂µθk
µ − ξk

0 → Θ → ∧0T ∗ ⊗ Rq

D−→ ∧1T ∗ ⊗ Rq

D−→ ... D−→ ∧nT ∗ ⊗ Rq → 0

In the present paper, we had dim(G) = n(n + 1)/2 in part A and dim( ˆG) = (n + 1)(n + 2)/2 in
part B. Moreover, whatever is the part concerned, ad(D) generates the CC of ad(D1) because D1
generates the CC of D while, similarly, ad(D1) generates the CC of ad(D2) because D2 generates
the CC of D1 and so on. We conclude with the following comments.

1) Coming back to the ﬁrst diﬀerential sequence constructed in part A, the Riemann tensor is
a section of F1 which is in the image of the operator Riemann or in the kernel of the operator
Bianchi. Indeed, Lanczos has been considering the Riemann tensor as a section of F1 killed by
the operator Bianchi considered as a diﬀerential constraint. Accordingly, he has used the action
of ad(Bianchi) on the corresponding Lagrange multipliers. However, this operator parametrizes
ad(Riemann) as we saw and cannot be used in order to parametrize the Riemann tensor by means
of the Lanczos potential.

2) Coming back to the second diﬀerential sequence constructed (independently) in part B, the
Weyl tensor is a section of ˆF1 which is in the image of the operator W eyl or in the kernel of the
operator Bianchi. As most of the results presented are unknown, in particular the fact that both
operators W eyl and Bianchi are second order in dimension n = 4, we believe that even the proper
concept of a Weyl tensor candidate must be revisited within this new framework.

3) In parts A and B, only linear diﬀerential operators have been used. However, it is known
from the formal theory of Lie pseudogroups that non-linear diﬀerential sequences can be similarly
constructed ([13],[19],[22]). As a matter of fact, if non-linear analogues of D and D1 may be exhib-
ited, this is not possible for D2. Moreover, the only important problem is to compare the image of
D with the kernel of D1 in the ﬁnite/inﬁnitesimal equivalence problem (See [19], p 333 for a nice
counterexample). We believe that this shift by one step backwards in the interpretation of a diﬀer-
ential sequence will become important for future physics. It is commonly done in the variational
calculus using ﬁnite elements where the free energy brings together the deformation tensor and the
EM ﬁeld on equal footing, quite contrary to the ideas of Lanczos.

6) CONCLUSION

In most textbooks, the Weyl tensor is always presented today by comparison with the Riemann
tensor after eliminating a conformal factor and its derivatives. We have exhibited new methods
in order to introduce both the Riemann and the Weyl tensor independently by using the formal

21

theory of systems of partial diﬀerential equations (Spencer cohomology) in the study of arbitrary
Lie pseudogroups while using the Vessiot structure equations for the Killing and conformal Killing
systems separately. In particular, we have revisited, in both cases, the proper concept of Bianchi
identities by means of homological algebra and diagram chasing, obtaining explicit numbers and
orders for each dimension. These striking results are conﬁrmed by means of computer algebra in
the Appendix. They prove that the work of Lanczos and followers must be revisited within this
new framework.

7.1) Conformal Killing system

Using an Euclidean or Minkowskian metric, the system of conformal Killing equations is:

r = 0.

but any other choice could be convenient too as we have explained in the paper.

7.2) Weyl tensor in dimension 2

Let us consider n = 2 and the euclidean metric ωij = δi

denotes the commutative ring of PD operators in d1 = ∂
∂x1
rewritten as W2 η = 0, where η = (ξ1

ξ2)T and:

j for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 2. If D = Q[d1, d2]

If we note λ2 =(cid:0) 1

minus the ﬁrst one. Hence, the D-module imD(W2) = {λ W2 | λ ∈ D1×2} generated by the rows
of W2 can be generated by the ﬁrst two rows of W2, i.e., we have imD(W2) = imD(R2), where R2
is the following matrix:

0 1 (cid:1), then we have λ2 W2 = 0, which shows that the last row of W2 is

d1 !
R2 =  d1 −d2

d2

We can check that the D-module kerD(R2) = {µ ∈ D1×2 | µ R2 = 0}, called the second syzygy
module ([4]) of the D-module M = D2/(D2 R2), is reduced to 0, i.e., R2 has full row rank. Hence,
we obtain the following ﬁnite free resolution of M :

Let us consider n = 3 and the euclidean metric ωij = δi

ξ3)T and:

If we note λ3 = (cid:0) 1 0

last row of W3 is a linear combination of the ﬁrst and fourth rows of W3. Hence, the D-module
imD(W3), generated by the rows of W3, can be generated by the ﬁrst ﬁve rows of W3, i.e., we have

1 (cid:1) ∈ D1×6, then we have λ3 W3 = 0 and shows that the

i.e., we have kerD(R3) = imD(S3) = {µ ∈ D1×5 | µ S3}. The computation of S3 takes 0.026 CPU
seconds with Maple 18 on Mac OS 10.10.5 equipped with 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7 and 16 Go. For
more details on the left kernel/syzygy computation, see Algorithm 1 on page 330 of ([1]) (see also
[3]). Similarly, the left kernel of T3 is generated by the rows of the following matrix

i.e., we have kerD(S3) = imD(T3). We can check that that the matrix T3 has full row rank, i.e.,
kerD(T3) = 0, or equivalently that the rows of T3 are D-linearly independent. Finally, if we denote
by M = D3/(D5 R3) = D3/(D6 W3) the D-module ﬁnitely presented by R3, associated with the
system, then we obtain the following ﬁnite free resolution:

olution:

0 → D4 U4−→ D9 T4−→ D10 S4−→ D9 R4−→ D4 → M → 0

Finally, we note that a free resolution of M can be computed in 0.616 CPU seconds when n = 4.
