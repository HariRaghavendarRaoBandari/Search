ABSTRACT

We report on timing, ﬂux density, and polarimetric observations of the transient magnetar and 5.54 s radio
pulsar XTE J1810- 197 using the Green Bank, Nançay, and Parkes radio telescopes beginning in early 2006,
until its sudden disappearance as a radio source in late 2008. Repeated observations through 2016 have not
detected radio pulsations again. The torque on the neutron star, as inferred from its rotation frequency derivative
˙ν, decreased in an unsteady manner by a factor of 3 in the ﬁrst year of radio monitoring, until approximately
mid-2007.
In contrast, during its ﬁnal year as a detectable radio source, the torque decreased steadily by
only 9%. The period-averaged ﬂux density, after decreasing by a factor of 20 during the ﬁrst 10 months of
radio monitoring, remained relatively steady in the next 22 months, at an average of 0.7 ± 0.3 mJy at 1.4 GHz,
while still showing day-to-day ﬂuctuations by factors of a few. There is evidence that during this last phase
of radio activity the magnetar had a steep radio spectrum, in contrast to earlier ﬂat-spectrum behavior. There
was no secular decrease that presaged its radio demise. During this time the pulse proﬁle continued to display
large variations, and polarimetry, including of a new proﬁle component, indicates that the magnetic geometry
remained consistent with that of earlier times. We supplement these results with X-ray timing of the pulsar from
its outburst in 2003 up to 2014. For the ﬁrst 4 years, XTE J1810- 197 experienced non-monotonic excursions
in frequency derivative by at least a factor of 8. But since 2007, its ˙ν has remained relatively stable near
its minimum observed value. The only apparent event in the X-ray record that is possibly contemporaneous
with the radio shut-down is a decrease of ≈ 20% in the hot-spot ﬂux in 2008–2009, to a stable, minimum
value. However, the permanence of the high-amplitude, thermal X-ray pulse, even after the (unexplained)
radio demise, implies continuing magnetar activity.

1. INTRODUCTION

Magnetars are ultra-highly magnetized neutron stars (in-
ferred surface dipolar ﬁeld strengths Bs ≈ 1014- 15 G) that dis-
play hugely variable and sometimes very bright X-ray emis-
sion, powered by their decaying ﬁelds (Duncan & Thompson
1992). This process is reﬂected in their extremely unsteady
rotation. Their magnetic ﬁelds cause magnetars to spin down
very rapidly, and all those known have long periods, 2 < P <
12 s.

Among the 23 known magnetars (Olausen & Kaspi 2014)9,
four are known to be transient emitters of radio pulsations.
The ﬁrst to be so identiﬁed was the P = 5.54 s anomalous X-
ray pulsar (AXP) XTE J1810- 197, discovered in early 2003
following an X-ray outburst (Ibrahim et al. 2004). It is un-
clear when radio emission started, but pulsations were not
present in 1998, while a point source was visible by early
2004 (Halpern et al. 2005). Radio pulsations were detected
in early 2006 (Camilo et al. 2006), with some properties

that are markedly different from those of ordinary rotation-
powered pulsars, including extremely variable ﬂux densities
and pulse proﬁles, and ﬂat spectra (e.g., Camilo et al. 2007d;
Lazaridis et al. 2008). The emission is also highly linearly
polarized, like that of several ordinary young radio pulsars
(Camilo et al. 2007b; Kramer et al. 2007). To a great ex-
tent, these properties are shared by all four radio magnetars
identiﬁed so far (Camilo et al. 2007a, 2008; Levin et al. 2010;
Keith et al. 2011; Shannon & Johnston 2013).
The radio emission from XTE J1810- 197 arose follow-
ing the X-ray outburst. The X-ray ﬂux then decayed expo-
nentially and returned to pre-outburst levels in 2007–2008
(Bernardini et al. 2011). Here we show that XTE J1810- 197
ceased to emit detectable radio pulsations in late 2008, and
present the timing, ﬂux density, polarimetric, and pulse pro-
ﬁle behavior during its last 20 months of radio activity. We
also present X-ray timing measurements and ﬂuxes through
2014.

2. RADIO OBSERVATIONS

Our previously published radio studies of XTE J1810- 197
(also known as PSR J1809- 1943) are based on extensive
data sets largely from 2006. Here we present results based
on observations done with the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank
Telescope (GBT), the Nançay radio telescope (NRT), and the
CSIRO Parkes telescope, mainly through the end of 2008. Ta-
ble 1 summarizes relevant parameters for all the radio obser-
vations presented in this paper.

2.1. Radio Timing

In Camilo et al. (2007c) we showed the timing behavior
of XTE J1810- 197 through 2007 January, based largely on

GBT

1.4 GHz data collected with the BON spectrometer at the
NRT. As the ﬂux density decreased it became preferable to
time the pulsar at the GBT. We did this at 2 GHz using the
Spigot spectrometer, recording the data in search mode and
folding ofﬂine. Nevertheless, BON timing continued to be im-
portant, particularly during 2007 May–August when the GBT
was not available. The NRT observations were coherently
dedispersed, with the full band divided into 16 frequency
channels, then folded at the predicted pulsar period with 2
minute sub-integrations before mid-2007 and 30 s thereafter.
See Table 2 for a log of the timing observations newly pre-
sented here. Daily observations typically lasted 1 hr at Nançay
and varied greatly at the GBT, from 0.25 hr to 2 hr with most
at least 0.5 hr (i.e., from a couple of hundred to over 1000
pulsar rotations per session).
In principle there are unusual challenges involved in radio
timing of XTE J1810- 197, because of changing pulse pro-

ﬁles. In practice we found that on the vast majority of days
a simple procedure was sufﬁcient to obtain times-of-arrival
(TOAs) that could be used to describe reliably the rotation of
the star. We ﬁrst excised strong radio frequency interference
from the BON and Spigot data. BON timing was detailed
in Camilo et al. (2007c). For Spigot we obtained TOAs by
cross-correlating individual folded pulse proﬁles with a Gaus-
sian template. We then used the TOAs with the TEMPO soft-
ware10 to obtain timing solutions.
The position of XTE J1810- 197 was held ﬁxed in all
our timing ﬁts at that determined from VLBI observations
(Helfand et al. 2007);
the measured proper motion is too
small to affect the timing of this pulsar. As explained in
Camilo et al. (2007c), we maintained phase connection for
this pulsar since 2006 April, but the rotation frequency deriva-
tive was changing so rapidly that it proved more informative
to measure ˙ν (where ν = 1/P) by using TOAs typically span-
ning one month and doing a TEMPO ﬁt for only ν and ˙ν. We
did such ﬁts in segments of data offset by roughly 15 days to
provide good sampling of ˙ν, and the results are shown in Fig-
ure 1a. In this panel, the ﬁrst 17 measurements are reproduced
from Camilo et al. (2007c), while the next 33 measurements
are new.

It is clear from Figure 1a that over the last ∼ 400 days ˙ν
stabilized greatly, compared to earlier large variations. To in-
vestigate this in detail we obtained phase-connected ﬁts span-
ning the last year of timing data. In Figure 2a we show the
residuals from a simple ﬁt to rotation phase, ν, and ˙ν, show-
ing large residuals. In Figure 2b, we see that the addition of
¨ν absorbs all remaining residual trends. These timing solu-
tions are listed in Table 3. The positive value of ¨ν implies that
during this span -
˙ν (proportional to the braking torque) was

this apparently chaotic variation, the average ﬂux density of
the pulsar decreased by over an order of magnitude in the
10 months following its pulsed radio discovery, as seen in
Figure 1b (these pre-2007 data were originally presented in
Camilo et al. 2007c but have been reanalyzed here in order to
present a consistent ﬂux density record).

Most period-averaged ﬂux densities presented in this pa-
per (including all in Figure 1b) were obtained by measur-
ing for each daily observation the area under the pulse pro-
ﬁle, scaled to its off-pulse rms, and converting to a Jansky
scale using the observing parameters and telescope system
noise (cf. the SEFDeff values in Table 1; see section 7.3.2 of
Lorimer & Kramer 2004 for more details on this method). We
estimate that the absolute 1.4 GHz ﬂux density scale is accu-
rate to within 10%.

The greatest source of uncertainty arises from the impact of
radio frequency interference (RFI) and system noise ﬂuctua-
tions on this long period and, from 2007, faint pulsar. Each
pulse proﬁle was carefully excised of RFI in both the fre-
quency and time domains. Nevertheless, for approximately
one-third of all the post-2006 NRT observations, the RFI
was so bad or the ﬂux density was so low (approaching the
≈ 0.1 mJy detection threshold), that we did not extract a ﬂux
density measurement at all.
In some of the remaining in-
stances, as much as half of the data had to be discarded in
order to obtain an integrated proﬁle clean enough to mea-
sure ﬂux density. Mindful of these caveats (most often some
residual RFI is bound to remain, and individual measurements
could be greatly affected), we estimate that the NRT ﬂux den-
sity measurements in Figure 1b have a typical relative frac-
tional uncertainty of ≈ 20%, with a minimum of 0.1 mJy.

Two things immediately stand out from Figure 1b: daily
ﬂux density variations continued through the end of our data
set, by factors of a few; and the average 1.4 GHz ﬂux density
stabilized early in 2007, at a level of 0.68 ± 0.27 mJy for all
post-2006 NRT detections presented here. Also, the panels of
Figure 1 are curiously something of a mirror image to each
other.

2.2.1. Radio Disappearance

With no warning from either its timing or ﬂux density be-
havior, XTE J1810- 197 ceased to emit detectable radio pul-
sations in late 2008. The last detection at the NRT was on
October 29, on November 2 at the GBT (Figure 3), and at
Parkes on the following day. The next attempt to detect it was
on November 10. We attempted to detect the pulsar at Parkes
on 20 occasions through 2016 January, largely at 1.4 GHz,
each time for 0.5–1 hr. At the NRT we did 10 more observa-
tions through 2009 June. At the GBT we made a total of 17
attempts at 2 GHz, each ≈ 0.5 hr, through 2012 August. The
pulsar was not detected in any of these 47 observations span-
ning 7 years since 2008 November (Figure 4). We emphasize
that XTE J1810- 197 did not gradually fade into undetectabil-
ity. A few weeks before the last detection, we recorded beau-
tiful proﬁles (e.g., Figures 6d, 7c and 7d); the signal strength
and pulse proﬁles were ﬂuctuating at least as much as they
had for the previous ∼ 500 days. And then the radio pulses
were gone.

For an assumed pulse duty cycle of 6% (comparable to the
component widths often observed for this pulsar) and the pa-
rameters used in our monitoring observations (Table 1), the
upper limit on the ﬂux density of XTE J1810- 197 since late
2008 is approximately 0.1 mJy at 1.4 GHz based on the NRT
observations, slightly lower than that for the Parkes obser-

2.2. Radio Flux Densities

One unusual aspect of radio emission from XTE J1810- 197
is the ﬂuctuation on ∼ daily timescales of its period-
averaged ﬂux density, largely intrinsic to the pulsar (e.g.,
Lazaridis et al. 2008). These variations result from a com-
bination of different pulse proﬁle components becoming ac-
tive (i.e., because of radically changing proﬁles) and vary-
ing intensity from particular components. Superimposed on

vations, and approximately 0.03 mJy at 2 GHz based on the
GBT observations (Figure 4). These limits are nearly an or-
der of magnitude below the average ﬂux densities during the
1.8 years of radio emission post-2006, although not much be-
low the faintest established detections (see Figures 3 and 5).
The great proﬁle variability, long period, and RFI, make more
detailed estimates unreliable. In any case, since the last detec-
tion in late 2008, in none of 47 observations spanning 7 years
was the pulsar as detectable as in the poorest of more than 200
detections made over a period of 2 years before 2008 Novem-
ber.

2.3. Radio Spectrum

Figure 5. Flux density measurements for XTE J1810- 197 at 1.4 GHz and
2 GHz in 2007–2008. Parkes observations include those done with analog
(AFB) and full-Stokes digital (DFB) ﬁlterbanks. See Section 2.3 for details.

The available evidence suggests that during the faint epoch
that lasted for 2 years preceding its radio disappearance in late
2008, XTE J1810- 197 had a steep radio spectrum, contrast-
ing to its earlier generally ﬂat spectrum.

In Figure 5 we present all our post-2006 ﬂux density mea-
surements at 1.4 GHz and 2 GHz. The 1.4 GHz NRT values

are reproduced from Figure 1b. These are fundamentally con-
sistent with Parkes measurements at the same frequency from
six full-Stokes observations using pulsar digital ﬁlterbanks
(DFBs), analyzed with PSRCHIVE (Hotan et al. 2004), and
12 analog ﬁlterbank (AFB) observations.

from a subset of the GBT data used to derive TOAs (Sec-
tion 2.1), using the method outlined in Section 2.2 for NRT
and Parkes AFB observations. We determined the system
noise (Table 1) from a full-Stokes 2 GHz observation in the di-
rection of XTE J1810- 197, ﬂux-calibrated with PSRCHIVE.
Even after careful RFI excision, we selected for reliable ﬂux
density measurements only 40% of all observations from
which we extracted a TOA. We estimate relative fractional
uncertainties of ≈ 20% on average.

The 2 GHz measurements in Figure 5 range over 0.1–
0.5 mJy, with an average and standard deviation of S2 = 0.25 ±
0.10 mJy. This is to be compared to S1.4 = 0.68 ± 0.27 mJy for
the 1.4 GHz measurements in the ﬁgure (Section 2.2), span-
ning much the same time interval. At face value this would
seem to suggest a spectral index of α ≈ - 3 (where Sν ∝ ν α).
Given the inherent difﬁculties in extracting such a measure-
ment for this variable pulsar from non-simultaneous multi-
frequency observations susceptible to RFI despite our best ef-
forts, we do not claim a reliable numerical value for α. But
Figure 5 strongly suggests that XTE J1810- 197 indeed be-
came a steep-spectrum object during its ﬁnal “weak” state
prior to disappearance as a radio source, in that respect more
akin to an ordinary pulsar than earlier in its “high” state, when
the torque was also varying rapidly (Figure 1).

2.4. Polarimetry

All of our previously published XTE J1810- 197 polari-
metric data are from before 2006 December (Camilo et al.
2007b). The data published by Kramer et al. (2007) end even
earlier, but include single-pulse polarimetry. Here we present
some polarimetric observations done in 2007 and 2008 with
Parkes at 1.4 GHz and 3 GHz, using respectively the center
beam of the multibeam receiver and the 10 cm band of the
1050cm receiver. The data were collected using DFBs, and
analyzed with PSRCHIVE, as in Camilo et al. (2007b).

Figure 6a is a reprocessed version of a 2006 observation
presented in Camilo et al. (2007b), differing mainly in the ﬂux
density scale and amount of data excised due to RFI. The re-
calculated rotation measure is RM = 76 ± 1 rad m- 2, entirely
consistent with the value in Camilo et al. (2007b), and the
RMs calculated for the latter observations are consistent with
this value within their larger uncertainties.

The 3 GHz full-Stokes proﬁle (Figure 6c) looks simi-
lar to its counterpart from 1.5 years before (Figure 1c of
Camilo et al. 2007b). At 1.4 GHz, the two 2007/2008 proﬁles
(Figure 6b and 6d) show very similar position angles of linear
polarization (PA), and differ mainly in the relative amplitudes
of three total-intensity proﬁle components (labelled P2, P3,
and P4/5). Both proﬁles are close to 100% linearly polarized.
Comparison between the 2006 proﬁle (Figure 6a) and the
2007/2008 1.4 GHz proﬁles shows that the PA sweep and its
absolute values are similar for the “main pulse” regions (com-
ponents P3–P5). However, the 2007/2008 proﬁles show com-
ponent P2 not present in the 2006 proﬁle — whose P1 com-
ponent in turn is not seen later on. Proﬁle components P1–P5
altogether span 40% of pulse phase, and if they all display sta-
ble PAs between 2006 and 2007/2008, then in principle this
allows for a more conclusive investigation of geometry than
previously possible (see Section 4.1).

2.5. Radio Pulse Proﬁles

The total-intensity pulse proﬁles of XTE J1810- 197 were
always extremely variable, both in phase of active emitting

regions and in the daily appearance of each pulse proﬁle com-
ponent. The description that follows is based on a review of
hundreds of daily proﬁles that we obtained during 2006–2008
at the GBT, Parkes, and Nançay. There was never any stable
pulse proﬁle, but we detected emission from some pulse lon-
gitudes more often than from others, with some discernible
patterns over time, and radio pulsations were never detected
from many longitudes. In that sense, there was some long-
lasting stability to the radio-emitting region.

Referring to Figure 7a, emission was always detected from
the main pulse region (MP, in turn made up of at least three
discernible sub-structures, labelled P3–P5, not all necessar-
ily emitting at once). Emission from component P1 (see also
Figure 6a) was detected only during 2006, and it was the most
variable, sometimes being much brighter than the MP compo-
nents. On the other hand, P2 was active sometimes in 2006
and 2007 (Figure 6b), but became more common in 2008
(Figures 6d and 7c–d).
In 2007 the observed proﬁle often
consisted of emission from the MP region alone (Figure 7b).
In only one (2006) observation out of hundreds did we detect
emission from all these regions at once (Figure 7a).

The relative amplitudes of the different components varied
widely, exempliﬁed in Figure 7d by P4, usually not preemi-
nent but on this day the brightest of any. The very “spiky”
nature of the individual sub-pulses that built up the broader
integrated proﬁle components (see, e.g., Serylak et al. 2009)
continued to the very end (Figure 3).

Our sense is that in 2007–2008 the proﬁles were less vari-
able than in 2006, but this impression may be biased by
two factors:
the pulsar was much brighter in 2006, which
allowed the detection of very faint rarely observed compo-
nents (see Figure 2 of Camilo et al. 2007c); and the total in-
tegration (both in number and in average duration of observa-
tions) was larger in 2006 compared to later. In any case it is
clear that during the period when the torque had stabilized by
comparison to earlier huge variations, and when the period-
averaged ﬂux density had also stabilized in an average sense
at a low level (Figure 1), the pulse proﬁles of XTE J1810- 197
were still varying at unprecedented levels compared to normal
pulsars, and continued to do so until radio pulsations disap-
peared.

3. X-RAY OBSERVATIONS

In order to search for clues to the disappearance of radio
pulsations from XTE J1810- 197, we reviewed all its archival
Chandra and XMM-Newton data collected from 2003–2014.
Timing results from 2009 November onward are newly pub-
lished here. Detailed spectroscopic and ﬂux analysis are pre-
sented in Alford & Halpern (2016), with a summary of the
ﬂuxes given in Section 3.2. In summary, we ﬁnd that the X-
ray ﬂuxes stepped down to a minimum value around the time
that the radio pulsations shut off, and this is the only recogniz-
able event in X-rays that is plausibly contemporaneous with
the disappearance in radio.

Table 4 is a log of all XTE J1810- 197 timing observa-
tions performed by Chandra and XMM-Newton through 2014.
The Chandra ACIS observations were taken with the source
on the S3 CCD, and with a subarray of 100 or 128 rows to
obtain time resolution of 0.3 s or 0.4 s, respectively. XMM-
Newton observations used the pn CCD in full-frame or large-
window mode, with 74 ms or 44 ms resolution and, in most

features in the proﬁle that reoccur are labelled P1–P5 (as in Figure 6). We
deﬁne the “main pulse” (MP) region as being composed of up to features
P3–P5. Proﬁles are aligned by eye, and the absolute phase here is arbitrary.

cases, the MOS CCDs in small-window mode with 0.3 s res-
olution. We corrected the processed archival XMM-Newton
photons for leap seconds and time jumps when needed, and
applied the barycentric correction at the VLBI measured po-
sition. We then computed frequencies and 1 σ errors using
the Z2
1 test on photons in the 0.3–4 keV band. The two short
Chandra HRC observations that were obtained for the pur-
pose of source location have relatively uncertain frequencies,
and were not used in the subsequent analysis.

The frequency measurements are shown in Figure 8a.
These were used to track the time-varying frequency deriva-
tive from 2003–2009 by computing the difference in fre-
quency between adjacent XMM-Newton observations, usually
6 months apart. Where these ˙ν measurements overlap with
the more precise record obtained from radio observations dur-
ing 2006–2008 (Figure 1a), they agree. Figure 8b illustrates
that ˙ν varied by a factor of ≈ 6. In the months immediately
following the outburst, which was ﬁrst detected in 2003 Jan-
uary, monitoring by RXTE showed noisy spin-down with an
even higher mean frequency derivative of - 6.7 × 10- 13 Hz s- 1
(Ibrahim et al. 2004), which is ≈ 8 times the minimum value
of ≈ - 8 × 10- 14 Hz s- 1 measured by XMM-Newton in 2007–
2008 (Figure 8b).

Starting in 2009 September, more frequent observations
allowed a phase-connected solution to be established up
through 2012 May. This process was facilitated by the rel-
atively stable spin-down with small rate at later times. Be-
ginning with the two observations on 2009 September 5 and

7, we folded the photons jointly using the Z2
1 test, and used
the resulting frequency to fold the next observation, verify-
ing that the predicted phase agrees with the observed one to
< 0.2 cycles. Each subsequent observation was then added to
the joint ﬁt and the Z2
1 test was iterated with free parameters
ν and ˙ν, and ﬁnally ¨ν, until 15 observations were included.
The resulting ﬁt is shown by the solid line in Figure 8a, and
its ˙ν = - 9.21 × 10- 14 Hz s- 1 (Table 5) is very nearly a continu-
ation of the minimum spindown rate that was ﬁrst reached in
2007. The second frequency derivative as listed in Table 5
is necessary to ﬁt the 2009–2012 series with a continuous
ephemeris.

Analyzing the same data from which we established the
phase-connected ephemeris of Table 5, Pintore et al. (2016)
claimed to identify a timing anomaly in which the pulsar was
spinning up (positive ˙ν) between 2010 September and 2011
February. This could have arisen from their underestimation
of uncertainties in frequency measurements. In any case, our
phase-coherent ephemeris spanning this time shows no such
event. Pintore et al. (2016) also propose that there is a single
phase-connected timing solution spanning all of 2007–2014.
This is clearly invalid, because their listed uncertainties on the
polynomial coefﬁcients (ν, ˙ν, ¨ν) are two orders of magnitude
larger than what would be needed to describe a unique cycle
count. Also, the parameters of our actual phase-coherent tim-
ing segments in radio (Table 3) and X-ray (Table 5) disagree
with theirs. In particular, their ﬁtted ˙ν = - 4.9 × 10- 14 Hz s- 1 is
about half of the true value.

After 2012 May we were unable to maintain phase con-
nection. The prior coherent timing solution fails to pre-
dict the phase of the 2012 September observation by ≈
0.5 cycles. Possibly an anti-glitch (Archibald et al. 2013;
¸Sa¸smaz Mu¸s et al. 2014) and/or change in torque occurred be-
tween 2012 May and September. But we cannot tell for sure
what happened because the change in frequency differs from
the extrapolation by only 2 σ. We can only estimate the fre-
quency derivative from 2012 September to 2014 September
with an incoherent ﬁt to the frequencies, which is highly un-
certain. All we can say is that the long-term frequency deriva-
tive did not clearly change in 2012 (see Figure 8b).

From 2009 September to 2012 May, ˙ν changed by at most
4%, as measured by the frequency second derivative (which
is a factor of 6 smaller than that measured over the year fol-
lowing 2007 September; Table 3). Such behavior is common
in AXPs and soft gamma repeaters (SGRs), which often show
extended periods of smooth spin-down at small | ˙ν| as well
as noisier epochs with larger | ˙ν| (Kaspi et al. 1999, 2001;
Gavriil & Kaspi 2002; Woods et al. 2002, 2007; Tam et al.
2008; Dib et al. 2009; Dib & Kaspi 2014). At one time, it
was proposed that the combined action of free and radia-
tive precession could explain “bumpy” spin-down of AXPs
(Melatos 1999, 2000), which predicted that ˙ν would oscil-
late with a period of several years. However, as observa-
tions of dramatic changes in ˙ν from magnetars have accumu-
lated over the years, none are apparently dominated by such
periodic variations (see references above). There is at best
some evidence possibly indicating quasi-periodic ˙ν behavior
in one magnetar (Archibald et al. 2015). The timing behav-
ior of XTE J1810- 197 shown in Figure 8 seems typical when
compared with other magnetars that have been monitored for
longer times with no cyclic pattern evident in their spin-down.
Figure 9 shows three sample energy-dependent X-ray pulse
proﬁles from XMM-Newton, during (2007) and after (2009,
2011) the epoch of pulsed radio detection. They share the
same characteristics as earlier observations, in particular those
from 2005 and 2006 as shown in Gotthelf & Halpern (2007).
The pulse peaks are in phase as a function of energy, while the
pulsed fraction increases sharply with energy. This is under-
stood in a model in which a small hot spot is surrounded by a
cooler, larger annulus that covers most of the neutron star. In
summary, there is no obvious change in X-ray timing or pulse
shapes corresponding to the shut-down of radio emission in
late 2008.

the results

Figure 8c

is described in more detail

from blackbody
spectral modelling that
in
Alford & Halpern (2016). The spectrum is ﬁtted with either
two or three blackbodies, where the coolest one is restricted
to having a constant temperature and area representing the full
surface of the neutron star (dashed line in Figure 8c). The tri-
angles represent the ﬂuxes from one or two blackbodies (hot
and warm) of much smaller area that account for the decaying
outburst ﬂux. The squares are the total ﬂux at each epoch. It is
evident that the ﬂuxes have been steady since after 2009, just
after a slight decrease of ≈ 20% in the hot/warm component
between 2008 March and 2009 March. This small step-down
in ﬂux, corresponding to ∼ 8 × 1032 erg s- 1 in bolometric lu-
minosity, is the only event in X-rays that we have been able to
ﬁnd that is approximately coincident with the turn-off of radio
pulsations in late 2008.

3.3. X-ray and Radio Pulse Phase Alignment

Five of the X-ray observations listed in Table 4 were made
during the period in which XTE J1810- 197 was an active ra-
dio source (see also Figure 8). For these observations, we can
therefore compare the emission phases of the X-ray and ra-
dio proﬁles. For each of these observations (two made with
Chandra and three with XMM-Newton), we used TEMPO to
ﬁt for an offset between the X-ray TOA and a small num-

ber of surrounding radio TOAs (the latter corrected to inﬁnite
frequency using the DM from Table 3). The radio reference
phase is the peak of the main radio component, which owing
to changing pulse shapes can contribute up to 0.02 P jitter in
this comparison. The X-ray reference phase is the peak of the
approximately sinusoidal proﬁle, which has an effective un-
certainty of up to 0.1 P for the Chandra observations and is a
little better for the XMM-Newton proﬁles.

The measured offset between the X-ray and the radio TOAs
- 0.17, 0.01, and
was, in chronological order, 0.21, 0.03,
- 0.28 s. All radio and X-ray TOAs therefore match to within
0.05 P. Thus, at least between 2006 September and 2008
March, the peak of radio emission coincided with the peak
of X-ray emission.

4. DISCUSSION

4.1. Geometry of the Rotating Neutron Star

Since the main radio pulse coincides with the peak of
the X-ray emission, it is reasonable to assume that both ra-
dio and X-ray are coming from near the surface, where a
hot spot is located at the footpoint of a bundle of magnetic
ﬁeld lines (for the other two magnetars with detected radio
and X-ray pulsations, the radio proﬁle is not as well aligned
with, but still overlaps, the X-ray proﬁle; Halpern et al. 2008;
Pennucci et al. 2015). In this picture, currents ﬂowing along
this ﬁeld-line bundle are responsible for both surface heat-

10

CAMILO ET AL.

ing and radio emission. The X-ray and radio pulses should
coincide as long as the ﬁeld lines are normal to the surface
and the radio emission height is much smaller than the ra-
dius of the speed of light cylinder. While these are reason-
able assumptions for the open ﬁeld-line bundle in ordinary
pulsars, the geometry may be different in the case of magne-
tars, where currents on closed, twisted magnetic ﬁeld lines are
thought to contribute to X-ray emission via resonant cyclotron
scattering (Lyutikov & Gavriil 2006; Fernández & Thompson
2007), and the location of the radio emission region is
not obvious. Therefore, the rotating vector model (RVM;
Radhakrishnan & Cooke 1969) is not necessarily applicable
unless the radio emission is produced on open ﬁeld lines as in
ordinary pulsars. Theory and observation are inconclusive as
to whether radio emission in magnetars is produced on open
or closed magnetic ﬁeld lines (Thompson 2008).

Assuming that the RVM applies to magnetars, Camilo et al.
(2007b) used it to deduce the geometry of the star. There were
two possible solutions depending on whether an orthogonal
jump in polarization was introduced between widely spaced
pulse components (P1 and P3 in Figure 6a). In the ﬁrst solu-
tion, without an orthogonal jump, the magnetic and rotational
axes are almost aligned, α ≈ 4◦ and β ≈ 4◦, where α is the
angle between the magnetic and rotation axes, and β is the
angle of closest approach of the line-of-sight to the magnetic
axis. The second solution, with an orthogonal jump inserted,
had α ≈ 70◦ and β ≈ 25◦.

New data reported here show a polarized component not
present earlier (P2 in Figure 6b and d, at pulse phase between
those of P1 and P3). If we combine all the information on
the PA values from different epochs (namely from data repre-
sented in Figures 6a, b, and d), we obtain RVM ﬁts which are
consistent with those presented in Camilo et al. (2007b). The
result is again α ≈ 4◦, β ≈ 4◦ with no orthogonal jump. The
addition of an orthogonal jump between components P2 and
P3 (see Figure 6b) yields α ≈ 67◦ ± 10◦ and β ≈ 16◦ ± 5◦.
Broadly speaking, therefore, the same arguments apply as be-
fore — either the pulsar is aligned, which is problematic given
the X-ray pulse properties discussed below, or α is large and
the emission height, determined from the width of the pulse,
is also relatively large, ∼ 2 × 104 km, about 8% of the light
cylinder radius (see Camilo et al. 2007b).
It appears that the X-ray spectrum of XTE J1810- 197
has always been dominated by the thermal hot spot
and surrounding warm region (Gotthelf & Halpern 2005;
Halpern & Gotthelf 2005), which is supported by the single-
peaked X-ray pulse that aligns well in phase as a function of
energy. So the X-ray pulse has been modeled independently
of the radio as an indicator of the spin orientation and viewing
geometry of a surface hot spot, which can then be compared
with the results of the RVM ﬁts under the assumption that the
hot spot underlies a perpendicular radio beam. The most re-
cent such X-ray modeling results (Bernardini et al. 2011) al-
low, in our notation, α in the range 29◦–52◦, which is degen-
erate with ζ = |β + α|, while β ranges from 0◦ to 23◦. Their ex-
treme solutions have (α, ζ) = (29◦,52◦) or (α, ζ) = (52◦,29◦).
Neither of the RVM solutions are entirely consistent with
the model of the X-ray pulse, although the high pulsed frac-
tion of the harder X-rays would at least seem to rule out
a nearly aligned rotator with α ∼ 4◦, and a geometry with
(α, β) ≈ (52◦,16◦) seems reasonably compatible with both ra-
dio and X-ray observations.

4.2. Decline of the X-ray and Radio Luminosity

A detailed explanation for the exponential X-ray decay of
XTE J1810- 197 was developed by Beloborodov (2009). In
this model, a bundle of closed, twisted magnetic ﬁeld lines
centered on the magnetic dipole axis carries the current that
heats a spot on the surface. This so-called “j-bundle” is
the result of a twist of the crust by the starquake that ini-
tiated the outburst. As the j-bundle untwists, its boundary
recedes toward the magnetic pole; thus, the area of its foot-
point decreases, which accounts for the declining blackbody
area ﬁtted to the X-ray spectrum (Gotthelf & Halpern 2007;
Bernardini et al. 2009).
Beloborodov (2009) also accounts for the non-monotonic
change in spin-down rate of XTE J1810- 197, which after the
outburst ﬁrst increased then decreased as shown in Figure 8b.
The initial increase in torque is caused by growing twist of
ﬁeld lines near the magnetic axis, even as the outer boundary
of the j-bundle is shrinking. This twist inﬂates the poloidal
ﬁeld lines, effectively increasing the dipole moment and the
magnetic ﬁeld strength at the light cylinder. Once the twist
reaches a maximum stable value of ∼ 1 radian, the dipole
moment decreases due to the continued contracting of the j-
bundle, and the torque decreases.

In this picture, radio emission is produced on the closed
ﬁeld lines of the j-bundle, which is wider and more energetic
than the open ﬁeld-line bundle. Therefore, radio emission
from a transient magnetar in outburst could be easier to see,
both for geometric and energetic reasons, than in its quies-
cent state. Its radio beam could be broader and different in
many respects (spectrum, polarization, variability) from those
of ordinary radio pulsars. The radio pulse in this model is
coincident with the X-ray pulse, and when the j-bundle con-
tracts to less than the width of the observed radio beam, then
the radio emission should decrease rapidly.

However, in this model one may expect the width of the ra-
dio pulse to decrease gradually to zero as the j-bundle shrinks,
possibly approaching zero width and disappearing when the
outer boundary of the emitting region reaches the tangent
point to the observer’s line of sight. But this is contrary to
the observations, which show no change in the width or com-
plexity of the radio pulse just before it disappeared. The X-ray
ﬂux from the hot/warm spot showed at most a 20% decrease
(∼ 8 × 1032 erg s- 1) at the epoch of radio disappearance, when
there was no detectable change in spin-down power in the X-
ray timing. Since this luminosity change is comparable to or
greater than the spin-down power at the time, it is difﬁcult to
understand how spin power could be responsible for the event.
Probably a more subtle physical process is required to explain
the sudden quenching of the radio emission.

Rea et al. (2012) proposed that

the (then) three radio-
detected magnetars share the property that their quiescent
X-ray luminosity is smaller than their spin-down power,
but not the converse: not all magnetars with Lx/ ˙E < 1
are radio pulsars. However, review of these parameters
for XTE J1810- 197 shows that the minimum spin-down
power of XTE J1810- 197, which it reached in quiescence
in 2007–2012, is in the range ˙E = (5.6 - 6.6) × 1032 erg s- 1,
while its quiescent (0.3–10 keV) X-ray luminosity is Lx ≈
3.5 erg s- 1, uncorrected for absorption, both before
1 × 1033 d2
and after the outburst (Gotthelf et al. 2004; Bernardini et al.
2011; Alford & Halpern 2016). The distance of 3.5 kpc is
taken from Minter et al. (2008). The bolometric luminosity
of the cool component alone from Alford & Halpern (2016)

3.5 erg s- 1. These values of ˙E and Lx disagree with
is 4 × 1034 d2
the ones used in Rea et al. (2012), and do not support their
proposition, because the X-ray luminosity of XTE J1810- 197
is greater than its spin-down power, whether before, during, or
after the outburst.

Szary et al. (2015) explain radio pulsations from magne-
tars and ordinary radio pulsars by a single model, the par-
tially screened gap. It assumes that rotational energy heats the
open-ﬁeld-line polar cap, and the resulting temperature, com-
pared with a critical temperature for ion emission, is what de-
termines whether a partially screened gap is maintained. Only
if the luminosity of the polar cap is much less than the spin-
down power is radio emission possible. However, the tem-
perature of the X-ray/radio emitting cap in XTE J1810- 197
is larger than that of a rotation-powered pulsar with the same
timing parameters because it is heated by magnetic ﬁeld de-
cay, not by rotation. During the outburst of XTE J1810- 197
the polar cap luminosity rose by more than two orders of mag-
nitude while the spin-down luminosity only increased by a
factor of 8. So it is not clear how this model could explain
the onset or turn-off of radio pulsations during the outburst of
XTE J1810- 197.

5. CONCLUSIONS

Radio pulsations appear to be characteristic of some, but
not all transient magnetars in outburst. The long record left
by the single known outburst of XTE J1810- 197 provides a
prototype for investigating the mechanism of magnetar radio
emission. The radio ﬂux densities and X-ray ﬂuxes each de-
clined by about a factor of 50 from the peak of the outburst
to the year 2006. Then the X-ray and radio luminosities both
levelled off in 2007. This large-amplitude correlation would
argue that the power for the radio emission comes from the
magnetar mechanism that creates currents in the pulsar mag-
netosphere and heats the neutron star crust, rather than from
rotation power.
The radio pulses of XTE J1810- 197 before they turned
off continued to show large day-to-day ﬂuctuations, unlike
ordinary radio pulsars. The radio spectrum appears to have
changed from ﬂat to steep as the radio (and X-ray) emission
leveled off. The emission remained highly polarized, and the
observation of a new polarized pulse component allowed us
to test and reﬁne the previously derived emission geometry
assuming a dipole ﬁeld geometry. This was compared with
independent modeling of the X-ray pulse, which is coincident
in phase with the main radio pulse. The radio polarization al-
lows two solutions, depending on whether an orthogonal jump
in polarization is assumed between pulse components. How-
ever, the almost aligned solution appears inconsistent with the
large-amplitude X-ray pulse, so we favor the more inclined
model.

Finally, the radio pulsations turned off abruptly in late 2008,
and have not reappeared in the subsequent 7 years. However,
a continuing pulse of hard X-rays from a hot spot persists dur-
ing the radio quiet epoch and exceeds the spin-down luminos-
ity, evidence of continuing magnetar activity. This should not
be thought of as a “return to quiescence,” because magnetar
activity is not a quiescent state, but a continuing conversion of
magnetic energy to luminosity that, for a period of years, may
well result in a quasi-constant luminosity. Also, we do not
know enough about the pre-outburst state of XTE J1810- 197
to determine if it had precisely the same emission properties
then as is does now, or if it was truly quiescent prior to the
outburst detected in early 2003.

The sudden radio disappearance prompted us to search for
any contemporaneous event in the X-ray record that could be
associated. The only possible such occurrence was a step-
down in the X-ray ﬂux of the hot spot by ≈ 20% between
2008 March and 2009 March. Although this would appear to
be a small effect, it bears some consideration, as none of the
other observations and theories offer a natural explanation for
the sharp radio turn-off.
