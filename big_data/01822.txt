Fractional Noether’s Theorem with Classical
and Caputo Derivatives: constants of motion for
non-conservative systems

G. S. F. Frederico · M. J. Lazo

Received: date / Accepted: date

Abstract Since the seminal work of Emmy Noether it is well know that all
conservations laws in physics, e.g., conservation of energy or conservation of
momentum, are directly related to the invariance of the action under a family
of transformations. However, the classical Noether’s theorem can not yields
informations about constants of motion for non-conservative systems since it
is not possible to formulate physically meaningful Lagragians for this kind
of systems in classical calculus of variation. On the other hand, in recent
years the fractional calculus of variation within Lagrangians depending on
fractional derivatives has emerged as an elegant alternative to study non-
conservative systems. In the present work, we obtained a generalization of the
Noether’s theorem for Lagrangians depending on mixed classical and Caputo
derivatives that can be used to obtain constants of motion for dissipative
systems. In addition, we also obtained Noether’s conditions for the fractional
optimal control problem.

1 Introduction

G. S. F. Frederico, M. J. Lazo

The fractional calculus with derivatives and integrals of non-integer order
started more than three centuries ago, with l’Hˆopital and Leibniz, when the
derivative of order 1/2 was suggested (see [46,53,56,57] for the history of frac-
tional calculus). This subject was then considered by several mathematicians
like Euler, Fourier, Liouville, Grunwald, Letnikov, Riemann, and many others
up to nowadays. Although the fractional calculus is almost as old as the usual
integer order calculus, only in the last three decades it has gained more atten-
tion due to its many applications in various ﬁelds of science, engineering, eco-
nomics, biomechanics, etc. (see [24,26,30,38,52] for a review). Actually, there
are several deﬁnitions for fractional derivatives, being the Riemann-Liouville
and the Caputo the most popular deﬁnitions. In special, the Caputo fractional
derivative was introduced by Caputo and Mainardi in a seminal work [11] to
model dissipation phenomenons. Fractional derivatives are generally nonlocal
operators and are historically applied to study nonlocal or time dependent
processes. In special, the ﬁrst and well established application of fractional
calculus in Physics was in the framework of anomalous diﬀusion observed in
many physical systems (e.g. in dispersive transport in amorphous semiconduc-
tor, liquid crystals, polymers, proteins, etc [31,23,40]). Recently, the study of
nonlocal quantum phenomena through fractional calculus began a fast devel-
opment, where the nonlocal eﬀects are due to either long-range interactions or
time-dependent processes with many scales [26,27,32,33,43,54,60]. Relativis-
tic quantum mechanics [25,29,42,50,62] and ﬁeld theories [6,10,34,55,59] has
been also recently considered in the context of fractional calculus.

The fractional calculus of variation was introduced in the context of classi-
cal mechanics. Riewe [51] showed that a Lagrangian involving fractional time
derivatives leads to an equation of motion with non-conservative forces such as
friction. It is a remarkable result since frictional and non-conservative forces are
beyond the usual macroscopic variational treatment [7]. Riewe generalized the
usual calculus of variations for a Lagrangian depending on Riemann-Liouville
fractional derivatives [51] in order to deal with linear non-conservative forces.
Actually, several approaches have been developed to generalize the least ac-
tion principle to include problems depending on Caputo fractional derivatives,
Riemann–Liouville fractional derivatives, Riesz fractional derivatives and oth-
ers [1,3,5,12,35,44,45] (see [39] for a recent review). Among theses approaches,
recently it was show that the action principle for dissipative systems can be
generalized, ﬁxing the mathematical inconsistencies present in the original
Riewe’s formulation, by using Lagrangians depending on classical and Caputo
derivatives [36]. The great importance of these results is the fact that the
calculus of variation with Lagrangians depending on both classical and Ca-
puto derivatives enable us to use all the mathematical machinery of classical
mechanics to study non-conservative systems.

Among the mathematical machinery of classical mechanics, the Noether’s
theorem o f calculus of variation becomes one of the most important theorems
for physics in the 20th century. Since the seminal work of Emmy Noether it is

well know that all conservations laws in mechanics, e.g., conservation of energy
or conservation of momentum, are directly related to the invariance of the ac-
tion under a family of transformations. On the other hand, non-conservative
forces remove energy from the systems and, as a consequence, the standard
Noether constants of motion are broken. In this context, the generalization of
the Noether’s theorem for the fractional calculus of variation is fundamental
to investigate the action symmetries for non-conservative systems. Recently, it
was show that it is still possible to obtain Noether-type theorems for fractional
calculus of variations which cover both conservative and nonconservative cases
[15,16,17,18,19,20,21,61]. In the present work, we generalize Noether’s theo-
rem for Lagrangians depending on mixed classical and Caputo derivatives. It
is important to stress that our results are based in the classical notion of con-
served quantity C, that is, the classical derivative of such a quantity is equal
to zero (dC/dt = 0). It is a diﬀerent approach from previous works [17,18,
19,20,21] where it was introduced the notion of fractional-conserved quantity,
where the classical derivative is substituted by a bilinear fractional operator
D (D(C) = 0). Consequently, our present work is free from the diﬃculties in-
troduced by the notion of fractional-conserved quantity (see [9] for a detailed
discussion). Furthermore, the generalized Noether’s theorem we obtain enable
us to investigate constants of motion for dissipative systems in the context
of the action principle formulated in [36]. As an example of application to
non-conservative systems, we study the problem of a particle under a fric-
tional force. Furthermore, we also generalize the Noether-type theorems for
the optimal control problem with classical and Caputo derivatives.

The paper is organized in the following way. In Section 2 we review the basic
notions of Riemann-Liouville and Caputo fractional calculus, that are needed
for formulating the fractional problem of the calculus of variations. The Euler-
Lagrange equation and the Noether’s theorem for Lagrangians depending on
mixed classical and Caputo derivatives are obtained in Section 3. An example
of application of the Noether’s theorem for a particle under a frictional force
is presented in Section 4. In Section 5 we generalize the Noether’s theorems
for the optimal control problem with classical and Caputo derivatives. Finally,
the conclusions are presented in Section 6.

Remark 2 The Caputo fractional derivative of a constant is always equal to
zero. This is not the case of the strict fractional derivative in the Riemann–
Liouville sense.

Remark 3 In the classical case α = 1, the fractional derivatives of Riemann–
Liouville and Caputo both coincide with the classical derivative. Precisely,

zero at t = a and t = b .

3 Main results: Euler–Lagrange equations and Noether’s theorems
for variational problems with classical and Caputo derivatives

In Section 3.1 we prove two important results for variational problems: a neces-
sary optimality condition of Euler–Lagrange type (Theorem 3) and a Noether-
type theorem (Theorem 7). The results are then extended in Section 5 to the
more general setting of optimal control.

3.1 Fractional variational problems with classical and Caputo derivatives

We begin by formulating the fundamental problem in Lagrange form under
investigation.

6

G. S. F. Frederico, M. J. Lazo

Problem 1 The fractional problem of the calculus of variations with classi-
cal and Caputo derivatives in Lagrange form consists to ﬁnd the stationary
functions of the functional

I[q(·)] =Z b

a

L(cid:0)t, q(t), ˙q(t), C

a Dα

t q(t)(cid:1) dt

(PC )

subject to given appropriate boundary conditions, where [a, b] ⊂ R, a < b,
dt , and the admissible functions q : t 7→ q(t) and the
0 < α < 1,
Lagrangian L : (t, q, v, vl) 7→ L(t, q, v, vl) are assumed to be C2:

˙q = dq

q(·) ∈ C2 ([a, b]; Rn) ;

L(·, ·, ·, ·) ∈ C2 ([a, b] × Rn × Rn × Rn; R) .

Functional of the kind (PC ) with mixed integer order and Caputo fractional
derivatives was previously considered in [36,44]. However, a Noether-type the-
orem for (PC ) is not yet considered in the literature. Furthermore, despite
that the fundamental problem (PC ) could easily be generalized for α > 1, we
choose 0 < α ≤ 1 for simplicity. Along the work, we denote by ∂iL the partial
derivative of L with respect to its ith argument, i = 1, . . . , 4 .

3.1.1 Fractional Euler–Lagrange equations

The Euler–Lagrange necessary optimality condition is central in achieving the
main results of this work. Our results are formulated and proved using the
Euler–Lagrange equations (3).

Deﬁnition 4 (Space of variations) We denote by Sh(a, b) the set of functions
h(·) ∈ C2 ([a, b]; Rn) such that h(a) = h(b) = 0 .

Deﬁnition 5 The funcional I[(·)] is Sh(a, b)-diﬀerentiable on a curve q(·) ∈
C2 ([a, b]; Rn) if and only if its Frchet diﬀerential

lim
ǫ→0

I[q + ǫh] − I[q]

exists in any direction h(·) ∈ Sh(a, b), then DI is called its diﬀerential and is
given by

DI[q](h) = lim
ǫ→0

I[q + ǫh] − I[q]

ǫ

.

Deﬁnition 6 (Fractional Sh-extremal with classical and Caputo derivatives).
We say that q(·) is an Sh-extremal with classical and Caputo derivatives for
funcional (PC ) if for any h(·) ∈ Sh(a, b)

DI[q](h) = 0 .

Proof We obtain equation 2 by direct computations with help of a Taylor
expansion.

We now obtain the fractional Euler–Lagrange necessary optimality condi-

tion.

Theorem 3 (Fractional
least-action principle). If q(·) is a Sh-extremal to
Problem 1, then it satisﬁes the following Euler–Lagrange equation with clas-
sical and Caputo derivatives:

t q(t)(cid:1) = 0,

Remark 5 If α = 1, Problem 1 is reduced to the classical problem of the
calculus of variations,

t ∈ [a, b] .

F (t, q(t), ˙q(t)) −→ min

with F (t, q(t), ˙q(t)) := L (t, q(t), ˙q(t), ˙q(t)), and one obtains from Theorem 3
the standard Euler–Lagrange equations [37]:

∂2F (t, q, ˙q) =

d
dt

∂3F (t, q, ˙q) .

(5)

Remark 6 Our variational Problem 1 only involves Caputo fractional deriva-
tives but both Caputo and Riemann-Liouville fractional derivatives appear in
the necessary optimality condition given by Theorem 3. This is diﬀerent from
[1,18] where the necessary conditions only involve the same type of deriva-
tives (Riemann-Liouville) as those in the deﬁnition of the fractional variational
problem.

Proof (of Theorem 3) According with Deﬁnition 6, a necessary condition for
q to be a Sh-extremal is given by

Z b
a h∂2L(cid:0)t, q, ˙q, C

a Dα

t q(cid:1) · h + ∂3L(cid:0)t, q, ˙q, C

a Dα

t q(cid:1) · C

a Dα

t hidt = 0 .

G. S. F. Frederico, M. J. Lazo

Using the fact that h ∈ Sh(a, b), and the classical and Caputo (1) integra-
tion by parts formulas in the second and third terms of the integrand of (6),
respectively, we obtain

Z b
a h∂2L(cid:0)t, q, ˙q, C

t q(cid:1)i · h dt = 0.

Equality (3) follows from the application of the fundamental lemma of the
calculus of variations (see, e.g., [22]).

3.1.2 Fractional Noether’s theorem

A classical result of Emmy Noether provides a relation between groups of
symmetries of a given equation and constants of motion, i.e. ﬁrst integrals.
Precisely, if a Lagrangian system is invariant under a group of symmetries
then it admits an explicit conservation law.

The symmetries are deﬁned via the action of one parameter group of dif-

feomorphisms as follows

Deﬁnition 7 (Group of symmetries) For any real ε , let ψ(ε, ·) : Rn → Rn
be a diﬀeomorphism. Then Ψ = {ψ(ε, ·)}ε∈R is a one parameter group of
diﬀeomorphisms of Rn if it satisﬁes:

1. ψ(0, ·) = IdRn ;
2. ∀ε, ε′ ∈ R, ψ(ε, ·) ◦ ψ(ε′, ·) = ψ(ε + ε′, ·);
3. ψ(·, ·) is of class C2 with respect to ε .

Usual examples of one parameter groups of diﬀeomorphisms are given by

translations in a given directions v

and rotations of angle ω

ψ : q 7−→ q + εv ,

q ∈ Rn

ψ : q 7−→ qeiεω ,

q ∈ C .

In [16,17] the authors use the related notion of one parameter family of
inﬁnitesimal transformations, instead of group of diﬀeomorphisms. They are
obtained using a Taylor expansion of yt(ε) = ψ(ε, q(t)) in a neighborhood of
0 . We obtain

yt(ε) = ψ(0, q(t)) + ε

(0, q(t)) + o(ε) .

∂ψ
∂ε

Having in mind that ψ(0, ·) = IdRn , we deduce that an inﬁnitesimal transfor-
mation is of the form

q(t) 7−→ q(t) + εξ(t, q(t)) + o(ε)

where ∂ψ

∂ε (0, q(t)) = ξ(t, q(t)) .

In order to prove a fractional Noether’s theorem for Problem 1 we adopt
a technique used in [18,28]. The proof is done in two steps: we begin by
proving a Noether’s theorem without transformation of the time (without
transformation of the independent variable); then, using a technique of time-
reparametrization, we obtain Noether’s theorem in its general form.

The action of one parameter group of diﬀeomorphisms on a Lagrangian

allows to deﬁne the notion of a symmetry for a fractional functional (PC )

Deﬁnition 8 (Invariance without transforming the time). Functional (PC ) is
said to be ε-invariant under the action of one parameter group of diﬀeomor-
phisms Ψ2 = {ψ2(ε, ·)}ε∈R of Rn if it satisﬁes for any solution q(·) of (3)

with the help of this deﬁnition.

Theorem 7 gives a new and interesting result for autonomous fractional
variational problems. Let us consider an autonomous fractional variational
problem i.e., the case when function L of (PC ) do not depends explicitly on
the independent variable t:

Proof As the Lagrangian L does not depend explicitly on the independent
variable t, we can easily see that (20) is invariant under translation of the
time variable: the condition of invariance (13) is satisﬁed with ψ1(ε, t) = t + ε
and ψ2(ε, q(t)) = q(t). Indeed, given that dψ1

4 Noether’s theorem for the linear friction problem

In order to formulate an action principle for dissipative systems free from the
problems found in the original Riewe’s approach, in a recent work [36] it was
proposed that the equation of motion for dissipative systems can be obtained
by taking the limit a → b with t = a + (b − a)/2 = (a + b)/2 in the extremal
of the action

I[q(·)] =Z b

a

(21)

Furthermore, it was proposed a quadratic Lagrangian for a particle under a
frictional force proportional to the velocity as [36]

(22)

where the three terms in (22) represent the kinetic energy, potential energy,
and the fractional linear friction energy, respectively. Since the equation of
motion is obtained in the limit a → b, if we consider the last term in (22) up
to ﬁrst order in ∆t = b − a we get:

the frictional force γ ˙q in the displacement ∆q ≈ ˙q∆t. This additional constant
is a consequence of the use of fractional derivatives in the Lagrangian and
do not appears in the equation of motion after we apply the action principle
[36]. Furthermore, the Lagrangian (22) is physical in the sense it provide us
with physically meaningful relations for the momentum and the canonical
Hamiltonian [36]

From (25) and (24) we can see that the Lagrangian (22) is physical in the
sense it provides us a correct relation for the momentum p1 = m ˙q, and a
physically meaningful Hamiltonian (it is the sum of all energies). Furthermore,

Finally, Noether’s invariant theorems states that if an action remains in-
variant with respect to a group of transformations, such transformations leads
to a corresponding conservation law. Since for the Lagrangian (22) the linear
friction is an autonomous fractional problem, Corollary 1 gives us

From (28) it is ease to see that the Hamiltonian for a particle under frictional
forces is not a conserved quantity, as expected. The Hamiltonian and conse-
quently the total energy of the system is only time locally conserved, when we
consider only very short time intervals by taking the limit a → b. In this last
case we have C

5 Fractional optimal control problems with classical and Caputo
derivatives

We now adopt the Hamiltonian formalism in order to generalize the Noether
type results found in [14,19,58] for the more general context of fractional
optimal control problems with classical and Caputo derivatives. For this, we
make use of our Noether’s Theorem 7 and the standard Lagrange multiplier
technique (cf. [14]). The fractional optimal control problem with classical and
Caputo derivatives is introduced, without loss of generality, in Lagrange form
as in [4,48]:

I[q(·), u(·), µ(·)] =Z b

(32)

The Lagrangian L : [a, b] × Rn × Rm × Rd → R, the velocity vector ϕ :
[a, b]×Rn×Rm → Rn and the fractional velocity vector ρ : [a, b]×Rn×Rd → Rn
are assumed to be functions of class C1 with respect to all their arguments.
We also assume, without loss of generality, that 0 < α < 1. In conformity with
the calculus of variations, we are considering that the control functions u(·)
and µ(·) take values on an open set of Rm and Rd, respectively.

Remark 8 The fractional functional of the calculus of variations with classical
and Caputo derivatives (PC ) is obtained from (29)–(31) choosing
ϕ(t, q, u) = u and ρ(t, q, µ) = µ.

5.0.3 Fractional Pontryagin Maximum Principle

In the ﬁfties of the twentieth century, L.S. Pontryagin and his collaborators
proved the main necessary optimality condition for optimal control problems:
the famous Pontryagin Maximum Principle [49].

In this subsection we prove a fractional maximum principle with the help

of optimality conditions (3).

Deﬁnition 10 (Process with classical and Caputo derivatives). An admissible
triplet (q(·), u(·), µ(·)) that satisﬁes the control system (30)–(31) of the optimal
control problem (29)–(32), t ∈ [a, b], is said to be a process with classical and
Caputo derivatives.

For convenience of notation, we introduce the following operator:

[q, u, µ, p, pα](t) = (t, q(t), u(t), µ(t), p(t), pα(t))

Remark 9 In mechanics, p(·) and pα(·) correspond to the generalized momen-
tum related to ˙q(·) and C
q(·), respectively. In the language of optimal
control p(·) and pα(·) are called the adjoint variables.

Theorem 8 (Fractional Pontryagin Maximum Principle). If
(q(·), u(·), µ(·)) is a process for problem (29)–(32), in the sense of Deﬁni-
tion 10, then there exists co-vector functions p(·) ∈ P C1([a, b]; Rn) and pα(·) ∈
P C1([a, b]; Rn) such that for all t ∈ [a, b] the quadruple (q(·), u(·), p(·), pα(·))
satisﬁes the following conditions:

= L (t, q(t), u(t), µ(t)) + p(t) · ϕ (t, q(t), u(t)) + pα(t) · ρ(t, q(t), µ(t)) .

(35)

Proof Minimizing (29) subject to (30)–(31) is equivalent, by the Lagrange mul-
tiplier rule, to minimize the augmented functional J[q(·), u(·), µ(·), p(·), pα(·)]

Remark 10 For problems of the calculus of variations with classical and Ca-
puto derivatives, one has ϕ(t, q, u) = u and ρ(t, q, µ) = µ (Remark 8). There-
fore, H = L + p · u + pα · µ. From the Hamiltonian system (33) we get

explicitly on the independent variable t:

tion 12 applied to the Problem (41)–(43).

The Corollary 2 shows that in contrast with the classical autonomous prob-
lem of optimal control, for (41)–(43) the Hamiltonian H does not deﬁne a
conservation law. Instead of the classical equality d

dt (H) = 0, we have

i.e., conservation of the Hamiltonian H plus a quantity that depends on the
fractional order α of diﬀerentiation. This seems to be explained by violation
of the homogeneity of space-time caused by the fractional derivatives, when
α 6= 1. If α = 1, then we obtain from (45) the classical result: the Hamiltonian
H is preserved along all the Pontryagin extremals.

6 Conclusion

G. S. F. Frederico, M. J. Lazo

In the present work, we obtained a generalization of the Noether’s theorem for
Lagrangians depending on mixed classical and Caputo derivatives that can be
used to obtain constants of motion for dissipative systems. The Noether’s the-
orem of calculus of variation is one of the most important theorems for physics
in the 20th century. It is well know that all conservations laws in mechanics,
e.g., conservation of energy or conservation of momentum, are directly related
to the invariance of the action under a family of transformations. However,
the classical Noether’s theorem can not yields informations about constants
of motion for non-conservative systems since it is not possible to formulate
physically meaningful Lagrangians for this kind of systems in classical calcu-
lus of variation. On the other hand, in recent years the fractional calculus of
variation within Lagrangians depending on fractional derivatives has emerged
as an elegant alternative to study non-conservative systems. In this context,
the generalization of the Noether’s theorem for the fractional calculus of vari-
ation is fundamental to investigate the action symmetries for non-conservative
systems. As an example of application to non-conservative systems, we study
the problem of a particle under a frictional force. In addition, we also obtained
Noether’s conditions for the fractional optimal control problem.
