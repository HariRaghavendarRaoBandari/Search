Γ-convergence and relaxations for gradient

ﬂows in metric spaces: a minimizing

movement approach

Florentine Fleißner ∗

Abstract

We present new abstract results on the interrelation between the
minimizing movement scheme for gradient ﬂows along a sequence of
Γ-converging functionals and the gradient ﬂow motion for the corre-
sponding limit functional, in a general metric space. We are able to
allow a relaxed form of minimization in each step of the scheme, and
so we present new relaxation results too.

Γ→ φ, one can consider the
For a sequence of Γ-converging functionals φǫ
minimizing movement scheme for gradient ﬂows along (φǫ)ǫ>0, in which every
time step τ is associated with a parameter ǫ = ǫ(τ ), simultaneously passing
to the limit in the time steps τ → 0 and parameters ǫ → 0.
The aim of the paper is to introduce and study an abstract condition
concerning the choice ǫ = ǫ(τ ) in order to obtain curves of maximal slope
for the limit functional φ. Moreover, we want to allow a relaxed form of
minimization in each step of the scheme.

Curves of maximal slope and Γ-convergence The notion of curves of
maximal slope goes back to [11], with further developments in [13], [14].

Let (S , d) be a complete metric space. Curves of maximal slope for an
extended real functional φ : S → (−∞, +∞] with respect to its relaxed
slope are described by the energy dissipation inequality (EDI(φ))

φ(u(s)) − φ(u(t)) ≥

1

2 Z t
s |∂−φ|2(u(r)) dr +

1

2Z t
s |u′|2(r) dr

for L 1-a.e. s, t, s ≤ t, in which |∂−φ| denotes the relaxed slope and |u′| the
metric derivative (section 2.1).

2

In the ﬁnite dimensional and smooth setting, this corresponds to the

gradient ﬂow equation

The term gradient ﬂow is also common for curves of maximal slope.

u′(t) = −∇φ(u(t)).

Let a sequence of energy functionals (φǫ)ǫ>0 Γ-converging to a limit func-

tional φ be given. A natural question arises:

If uǫ are curves of maximal slope for φǫ and they converge to a

curve u, is u then a curve of maximal slope for φ? (⋆)

1) The λ-convex case Since the pioneering work on G-convergence for
diﬀerential operators [22], [12], the following statement is well-known: If the
functionals are λ-convex with equi-compact sublevel sets and S is a Hilbert
space, and the initial data converge, then the gradient ﬂows uǫ converge to
the limit gradient ﬂow (in fact, Mosco convergence is suﬃcient in this case
[3]). A corresponding result can be proved for metric spaces as well [9].

2) The Serfaty-Sandier approach The considerations by Sandier and
Serfaty in [20], [21] are motivated by the convergence of the Ginzburg-Landau
heat ﬂow and the question of a general underlying structure in the cases in
which a positive answer can be given to (⋆). Their main assumption is that
the upper gradients |∂−φǫ|, |∂−φ| satisfy

uǫ → u ⇒ lim inf
ǫ→0

|∂−φǫ|(uǫ) ≥ |∂−φ|(u).

(1.1)

A related problem for generalized gradient systems and rate-independent

evolution is studied in [15], [17], [16].

In the λ-convex case, the following condition on the local slopes can be

proved [18]:

uǫ → u ⇒ lim inf
ǫ→0

|∂φǫ|(uǫ) ≥ |∂φ|(u)

(1.2)

(see section 2.1 for the deﬁnition of local slope).

So in both situations 1) and 2), the slopes satisfy a Γ-liminf condition.

In general, such a condition does not hold.

3

3) The general case

In general, the answer to our question (⋆) is no. Even in the ﬁnite di-
mensional and smooth setting (as in Example 1.1), the limit of a sequence of
gradient ﬂows uǫ for φǫ is in general no solution to the gradient ﬂow equation
for the limit functional φ.

For illustrative purposes, we give a simple example.

Example 1.1. We consider fǫ(x) = x2 + ρǫ cos2(cid:0) x
f (x) = x2 (x ∈ R). Let uǫ : [0, +∞) → R satisfy
u′ǫ(t) = −f′ǫ(uǫ(t)),
uǫ(0) = u0
ǫ

ǫ(cid:1) (ǫ << ρǫ → 0) and

with initial values u0
ǫ → u0 6= 0. Then (uǫ)ǫ>0 converges pointwise to the
constant curve u ≡ u0 which does not solve the gradient ﬂow equation for f .
The notion of Γ-convergence allows for a wide range of perturbations φǫ
of φ so that a passage to the limit ǫ → 0 in the energy dissipation inequality
(EDI(φǫ)) −→ (EDI(φ)) is in general not possible for lack of control over the
upper gradients |∂−φǫ| of φǫ.

Our approach aims to study the gradient ﬂow motion along (φǫ)ǫ>0 on
the level of the minimizing movement schemes and to establish a connection
with the gradient ﬂow motion of the limit functional φ.

Minimizing movements At the beginning of the 90’s, Ennio De Giorgi
introduced the notion of minimizing movements [10] as “natural meeting
point” of many diﬀerent research ﬁelds in mathematics.

The minimizing movement scheme for gradient ﬂows is given by

with n ∈ N and time steps τ > 0.
It is closely related to the notion of
curves of maximal slope. Under suitable assumptions, the piecewise constant
interpolations of the discrete values (un
τ )n∈N converge (up to a subsequence)
to a curve of maximal slope for ψ (as τ → 0) [2]. The scheme mimics the
gradient ﬂow motion along the functional ψ on a discrete level. (section 2.3)

We are interested in the cases in which the limit curves of the minimizing

movement scheme along (φǫ)ǫ>0 are curves of maximal slope for φ.

In ([5], chapter 8) such minimization problems are examined for concrete

examples of functionals φǫ

Γ→ φ, highlighting the dependence of the asymp-
Moreover, under suitable assumptions on φǫ, the following statement can
be proved ([5], Theorem 8.1) by means of the Fundamental Theorem of Γ-
convergence and a diagonal argument:

If discrete values (un

τ,ǫ)n∈N0 (τ, ǫ > 0) are given in accordance to the

scheme above, then

• there exists ǫ = ǫ(τ ) such that any limit curve of the corresponding
piecewise constant interpolations (uτ,ǫ(τ ))τ >0 can also be obtained by
the minimizing movement scheme along the single functional φ,

• there exists τ = τ (ǫ) such that any limit curve of (uτ (ǫ),ǫ)ǫ>0 is the limit

of a sequence of curves of maximal slope for φǫ.

In view of this result and the examples in [5], we notice that the interac-
tion between the time step τ and the parameter ǫ should be crucial in order
to achieve convergence of the scheme to a curve of maximal slope for φ. This
goes hand in hand with our considerations on why the passage to the limit
in the energy dissipation inequality is in general not possible.

A special case in which the desired convergence of the scheme holds inde-
pendent of the interaction between ǫ and τ is considered by Ortner in [18],
by extending the arguments of [2]. His main assumption is the Γ-liminf con-
dition (1.2) on the local slopes which can be viewed as discrete counterpart
of the Serfaty-Sandier condition (1.1).

Aim of our paper This paper aims to derive a general condition concern-
ing the choice ǫ = ǫ(τ ) in order to achieve convergence of the minimizing
movement scheme along (φǫ)ǫ>0 to curves of maximal slope for φ. Note that
we interpret the gradient ﬂow motion along (φǫ)ǫ>0 as joint steepest descent
movement instead of considering the single energy dissipation inequalities
(EDI(φǫ)): We pass to the limits τ → 0 and ǫ → 0 simultaneously in the
minimizing movement scheme, with a suitable choice ǫ = ǫ(τ ). By compari-
son, the study of the limit behaviour of (EDI(φǫ)) (as in [20], [21]) is related
to ﬁrst passing to the limit τ → 0 in the scheme for ﬁxed ǫ > 0 and only
then passing to the limit ǫ → 0.
A special feature of our theory is that we are able to relax the minimizing
movement scheme along (φǫ)ǫ>0 by allowing approximate minimizers in each
step. We do not need the existence of exact solutions to the minimization
problems. In particular, we do not need to require any lower semicontinuity
or compactness property of the single functionals φǫ.

As a particular case, the paper also deals with a relaxation of the classical

minimizing movement scheme along a single functional.

Let us introduce a relaxed minimizing movement scheme along (φǫ)ǫ>0.
We associate every time step τ > 0 with a parameter ǫ = ǫ(τ ) → 0 (τ → 0)
in such a way that ǫ(τ ) converges to 0 as τ → 0.

Relaxed minimizing movement scheme along (φǫ)ǫ>0 For every time
step τ > 0, ﬁnd a sequence (un

τ )n∈N by the following scheme.

A general condition concerning the right choice ǫ = ǫ(τ ) in (1.3)

all uτ , u ∈ S with uτ → u, supτ φǫ(τ )(uτ ) < +∞ it holds that

denotes the Moreau-Yosida approximation. Our condition (1.4) relates the
diagonal steepest descent movement along the sequence (φǫ)ǫ>0 with the re-
laxed slope of φ.

Under suitable natural coercivity assumptions, we prove

• if condition (1.4) holds for ǫ = ǫ(τ ), then any limit curve of our relaxed
minimizing movement scheme along (φǫ)ǫ>0 with choice ǫ = ǫ(τ ) is a
curve of maximal slope for φ. (see Theorem 3.4, Proposition 3.7)

If (S , d) is separable, we can prove

• there always exists a sequence (ǫτ )τ >0 with ǫτ > 0 such that our main
assumption (1.4) is satisﬁed for all choices (ǫ(τ ))τ >0 with ǫ(τ ) ≤ ǫτ
(ǫ(τ ) → 0). (see Theorem 6.1)

We notice that this choice ǫ = ǫ(τ ) solely depends on the velocity of Γ-
convergence φǫ

Γ→ φ.

A general example for the choice ǫ = ǫ(τ ) We prove under suitable

holds for every u ∈ S , ρn → 0 (ρn > 0), then (1.4) is satisﬁed for every

Plan of the paper and further results
In section 2, we give basic deﬁni-
tions. In 2.2, we specify our topological assumptions (which allow for metric
topological spaces (S , d, σ) where the topology σ does not necessarily coin-
cide with the one induced by the metric d).

In section 3, we introduce the relaxed minimizing movement scheme (1.3)
along (φǫ)ǫ>0 and we prove the convergence of the scheme to the gradient
ﬂow motion of the limit functional φ under the main assumption (1.4). We
discuss a generalization of our theory to a non-uniform distribution of the
error in (1.3).

In section 4, we focus on the special case in which φǫ = ψ is independent
of ǫ > 0. Applying the results of section 3, we show that one may allow a
relaxed form of minimization in the clasical scheme along a single functional.
Moreover, we notice that the error order o(τ ), characterizing the asymp-
totic behaviour of γτ τ in the deﬁnition of the relaxed minimizing movement
scheme (1.3), is optimal. We also obtain a lower semicontinuous envelope
relaxation result.

In section 5, we consider the case that (φǫ)ǫ>0, φ satisfy the Serfaty-
Sandier condition (1.1) or its discrete counterpart (1.2). We prove that in
this situation, condition (1.4) is satisﬁed for every choice ǫ = ǫ(τ ).

In section 6, we prove, for the case that (S , d) is separable, the existence

of a right choice ǫ = ǫ(τ ) with regard to condition (1.4).

In sections 7 and 8, we illustrate general methods to determine ǫ = ǫ(τ )

with regard to (1.4).

In 8.1, we determine ǫ = ǫ(τ ) for the case that the general condition (1.5)

holds.

In 8.2, we show explicitly that the deciding factor in the whole theory is

the local behaviour of the Γ-converging sequence of functionals.

In 8.3, we consider time-space discretizations for a single functional, i.e.
we set φǫ = φ + IWǫ and we derive conditions on Wǫ(τ ) ⊂ S such that condi-
tion (1.4) holds.

In section 9, we mention possible generalizations of our theory.

2 Preliminaries

2.1 Gradient ﬂows in metric spaces

For an introduction to gradient ﬂows in metric spaces we refer to the fun-
damental book by Ambrosio, Gigli and Savar´e [2]. In this section we give a
brief overview of some of the basic deﬁnitions which can be found in detail
in ([2], chapter 1 and 2).

Let (a, b) be an open (possibly unbounded) interval of R.

In the ﬁnite dimensional case, the classical gradient ﬂow equation

u′(t) = −∇f (u(t)), t ∈ (a, b)

for a C 1-function f : Rd → R can be equivalently expressed by the equation

(f ◦ u)′(t) = −

1
2|u′|2(t) −

1
2 |∇f (u(t))|2 , t ∈ (a, b).

This equivalent formulation constitutes a heuristic starting point for the in-
troduction of gradient ﬂows in general metric spaces (S , d), the so-called
curves of maximal slope, for extended real functionals ψ : S → (−∞, +∞].

Absolutely continuous curves, relaxed slope

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let (S , d) be a complete metric space. We say that a curve
v : (a, b) → S is absolutely continuous and write v ∈ AC(a, b; S ) if there
exists m ∈ L1(a, b) such that

d(v(s), v(t)) ≤ Z t

s

m(r) dr ∀a < s ≤ t < b.

In this case, the limit

|v′|(t) := lim
s→t

d(v(s), v(t))

|s − t|

exists for L 1-a.e. t ∈ (a, b), the function t 7→ |v′|(t) belongs to L1(a, b) and
is called the metric derivative of v. The metric derivative is L 1-a.e.
the
smallest admissible function m in the deﬁnition above.

9

Let ψ : S → (−∞, +∞] be an extended real functional with proper

eﬀective domain

For v ∈ D(ψ) we deﬁne

D(ψ) := {ψ < +∞} 6= ∅.

|∂ψ|(v) := lim sup
→v

w

d

(ψ(v) − ψ(w))+

d(v, w)

.

Following [2], we consider a slight modiﬁcation of the sequentially σ-lower
semicontinuous envelope of |∂ψ| with respect to a suitable topology σ on S
(see section 2.2 for the topological assumptions).
Deﬁnition 2.2. The relaxed slope |∂−ψ| : S → [0, +∞] of ψ is deﬁned by
n {d(un, u), ψ(un)} < +∞(cid:27) .
|∂−ψ|(u) := inf(cid:26)lim inf

n→∞ |∂ψ|(un) : un

σ
⇀ u, sup

The concept of strong and weak upper gradients can be viewed as a weak
counterpart of the modulus of the gradient in a general metric and non-
smooth setting.
Deﬁnition 2.3. The relaxed slope |∂−ψ| is a strong upper gradient for the
functional ψ if for every absolutely continuous curve v ∈ AC(a, b; S ) the
function |∂−ψ| ◦ v is Borel and
|ψ(v(t)) − ψ(v(s))| ≤ Z t

s |∂−ψ|(v(r))|v′|(r) dr ∀a < s ≤ t < b.

In particular, if |∂−ψ| ◦ v|v′| ∈ L1(a, b) then ψ ◦ v is absolutely continuous
and

|(ψ ◦ v)′(t)| ≤ |∂−ψ|(v(t))|v′|(t) for L 1-a.e. t ∈ (a, b).

Deﬁnition 2.4. The relaxed slope |∂−ψ| is a weak upper gradient for the
functional ψ if for every absolutely continuous curve v ∈ AC(a, b; S ) such
that ψ ◦ v is L 1-a.e. equal in (a, b) to a function ϕ with ﬁnite pointwise
variation in (a, b) and |∂−ψ| ◦ v|v′| ∈ L1(a, b), it holds that

|ϕ′(t)| ≤ |∂−ψ|(v(t))|v′|(t) for L 1−a.e.t ∈ (a, b).

Now, we have all the ingredients to deﬁne curves of maximal slope.

10

Curves of maximal slope

Deﬁnition 2.5. Let |∂−ψ| be a strong or weak upper gradient for the func-
tional ψ : S → (−∞, +∞].
A locally absolutely continuous curve u : (a, b) → S is called a curve of
maximal slope for ψ with respect to its upper gradient |∂−ψ| if the following
energy dissipation inequality is satisﬁed for L 1-a.e. s, t ∈ (a, b), s ≤ t:

ψ(u(s)) − ψ(u(t)) ≥

1

2Z t
s |∂−ψ|2(u(r)) dr +

1

2Z t
s |u′|2(r) dr.

(2.1)

Under additional assumptions, the existence of curves of maximal slope
with respect to the relaxed slope can be proved [2]. Their proof is based
on the minimizing movement scheme for gradient ﬂows which we explain in
section 2.3.

Before outlining the connection between curves of maximal slope and the
notion of minimizing movements, we specify the assumptions on the metric
space (S , d) and the topology σ on it.

2.2 Topological assumptions

Throughout this paper

(S , d) will be a given complete metric space

(2.2)

and

σ will be an Hausdorﬀ topology on S compatible with d:

(un, vn) σ

⇀ (u, v) ⇒ lim inf
n→∞
σ
⇀ v.

⇀ u ⇒ vn

d(un, vn) → 0, un

σ

d(un, vn) ≥ d(u, v) ,

(2.3)

(2.4)

These are exactly the same topological assumptions as in [2]. The reasons
for which they are made are explained in [2] and can also be observed in this
paper.

11

2.3 Minimizing movement scheme for gradient ﬂows

The notion of minimizing movements was established by Ennio de Giorgi [10]
at the beginning of the 90’s, who got his inspiration from the paper [1].

Deﬁnition 2.6. Let F : (0, 1) × S × S → [−∞, +∞] be given and initial
values u0
τ , in
τ
the following way

⇀ u0 (τ → 0). If we can deﬁne uτ : [0, +∞) → S , uτ (0) = u0

σ

uτ (t) ≡ un

τ for t ∈ ((n − 1)τ, nτ ]

and

τ is a minimizer for F (τ, un−1
un

τ

,·), n ∈ N,

and if (a subsequence of ) (uτ )τ >0 σ-converges pointwise in [0, +∞) to a curve
u : [0, +∞) → S , then u is called a (generalized) minimizing movement for
F to the initial value u0.

If we apply the minimizing movement scheme to

F (τ, u, v) := f (v) +

1
2τ |u − v|2 (u, v ∈ Rd)

with f : Rd → R a Lipschitz continuous C 1-function, then the necessary
condition of ﬁrst order leads to a discrete version of the gradient ﬂow equa-
tion for f , and indeed, every (generalized) minimizing movement for F is a
gradient ﬂow for f .

With this in mind, for a given functional ψ : S → (−∞, +∞] we deﬁne

Fψ : (0, 1) × S × S → [−∞, +∞], Fψ(τ, u, v) := ψ(v) +

1
2τ

d2(v, u)

which seems to be only natural in order to construct steepest descent curves
for ψ.

A related object of study is the Moreau-Yosida approximation deﬁned
below. We will repeatedly use the Moreau-Yosida approximation and the
following notation.

12

Moreau-Yosida approximation Let τ > 0 be given. The Moreau-Yosida
approximation Yτ ψ of a functional ψ : S → (−∞, +∞] is deﬁned as

Yτ ψ(u) := inf

v∈S (cid:26)ψ(v) +

1
2τ

d2(v, u)(cid:27) , u ∈ S .

(2.5)

We deﬁne Jτ ψ[u] as the corresponding set of minimizers, i.e.

uτ ∈ Jτ ψ[u]

:⇔ ψ(uτ ) +

1
2τ

d2(uτ , u) = Yτ ψ(u).

(2.6)

Existence of curves of maximal slope Let ψ : S → (−∞, +∞] be
given.

The following existence result is proved in ([2], chapter 2 and 3):

If ψ satisﬁes assumption 2.7, then the set of generalized minimizing move-
ments for Fψ is non-empty and for every generalized minimizing movement
u : [0, +∞) → S the energy inequality

ψ(u(0)) − ψ(u(t)) ≥

1

2Z t
0 |∂−ψ|2(u(r)) dr +

1

2Z t
0 |u′|2(r) dr

(2.7)

holds for all t > 0.

Assumption 2.7. We suppose that there exist A, B > 0, u⋆ ∈ S such that
(2.8)

ψ(·) ≥ −A − Bd2(·, u⋆).

Moreover, we assume that the following holds:

sup
n,m

d(un, um) < +∞, un

σ

⇀ u ⇒ lim inf
n→∞

ψ(un) ≥ ψ(u)

(2.9)

and

n,m{d(un, um), ψ(un)} < +∞ ⇒ ∃ nk ↑ +∞, u ∈ S : unk
sup

σ
⇀ u.

(2.10)

13

In particular, if |∂−ψ| is a strong upper gradient, equality holds in (2.7)

and u is a curve of maximal slope for ψ with respect to |∂−ψ|.

If |∂−ψ| is only a weak upper gradient for ψ and we assume in addition

that ψ satisﬁes the following continuity condition

sup

n∈N {|∂ψ|(vn), d(vn, v), ψ(vn)} < +∞, vn

σ

⇀ v ⇒ ψ(vn) → ψ(v),

(2.11)

then the proof of the energy inequality (2.7) can be extended and the energy
dissipation inequality (2.1) be obtained.

Strategies to prove the conditions on the relaxed slope to be an upper
gradient and the continuity condition (2.11) respectively and examples in
which they are satisﬁed are expounded e.g. in [2], [19].

2.4 Γ-convergence

Γ-convergence was introduced by Ennio de Giorgi in the early 70’s.

Deﬁnition 2.8. Let X be a topological space. A sequence fj : X → [−∞, +∞]
sequentially Γ-converges in X to f∞ : X → [−∞, +∞] if for all x ∈ X,
xj → x the following liminf-inequality holds
f∞(x) ≤ lim inf
j→∞

fj(xj)

and if for all x ∈ X there exists a recovery sequence ˜xj → x such that

3 Main theorem

We systematically study the gradient ﬂow motion along a sequence of func-
tionals φǫ : S → (−∞, +∞] on the level of the minimizing movement scheme
in each step of which we are able to allow a relaxed form of minimization.
The functionals φǫ are associated with a limit functional φ : S → (−∞, +∞]
through a weakened Γ(σ)-liminf-inequality and a recovery sequence of initial
values.

3.1 Minimizing movement: Γ-convergence, relaxations
Let φ, φǫ : S → (−∞, +∞], D(φ), D(φǫ) 6= ∅ (ǫ > 0) be given.
between (φǫ)ǫ>0 and φ:

We are dealing with the following assumptions on (φǫ)ǫ>0 and the relation

Assumption 3.1. We suppose that there exist A, B > 0, u⋆ ∈ S such that
(3.1)

φǫ(·) ≥ −A − Bd2(·, u⋆) for all ǫ > 0.

Moreover, we assume that for ǫn → 0 (ǫn > 0) it holds that
n,m {φǫn(uǫn), d(uǫn, uǫm)} < +∞ ⇒ ∃ nk ↑ +∞, u ∈ S : uǫnk
sup

σ
⇀ u. (3.2)

Assumption 3.2. We suppose that (φǫ)ǫ>0 and φ are connected through a
weakened Γ(σ)-liminf-inequality, i.e. for ǫn → 0 (ǫn > 0) it holds that

sup
n,m

d(uǫn, uǫm) < +∞, uǫn

σ

⇀ u ⇒ lim inf
n→∞

φǫn(uǫn) ≥ φ(u).

(3.3)

In view of the theory developed in [2] (see section 2.3 in this paper), our

assumptions 3.1 and 3.2 arise quite naturally.

Let us deﬁne a minimizing movement scheme for the gradient ﬂow motion
along the sequence (φǫ)ǫ>0 with a relaxed form of minimization in each step
and time steps τ → 0.
We associate every time step τ > 0 in the scheme with ǫ = ǫ(τ ) > 0 in
such a way that ǫ(τ ) converges to 0 as τ → 0. This choice ǫ = ǫ(τ ) is crucial,
as we will see.

Main assumption The next assumption on the interrelation between the
relaxed slope |∂−φ| of φ and the relaxed minimizing movement scheme along
(φǫ)ǫ>0 is playing a central role throughout this paper.

Now, our theorem reads as follows.

Theorem 3.4. Let the assumptions 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 be satisﬁed and construct
uτ : [0, +∞) → S (τ > 0) according to (3.4) - (3.7).

then equality holds in (3.11) and

In particular, if the relaxed slope of φ is a strong upper gradient for φ,

u is a curve of maximal slope for φ with respect to |∂−φ|.

(3.12)

Some comments on our assumptions Please be aware of the fact that
we do not require any lower semicontinuity or compactness property of the
single functionals φǫ. Since we are allowing a relaxed form of minimization
(3.5) in our scheme, the coercivity (3.1) of every functional φǫ is suﬃcient to
guarantee the existence of the curves uτ for small τ > 0.

Some equi-coercivity and combined compactness assumption on (φǫ)ǫ>0
such as (3.1) and (3.2) in assumption 3.1 are needed in order to prove the
existence of a subsequence (uτk )k∈N pointwise σ-converging to a locally ab-
solutely continuous curve.

The energy inequality (3.11) can then be proved by using assumptions
3.2 and 3.3 which make the passage to φ and |∂−φ| possible. Some kind of
assumption appropriately connecting the relaxed slope of φ with the energy
driven motion along the sequence (φǫ(τ ))τ >0 with time steps τ > 0 is necessary
and our assumption 3.3 will turn out to be a good choice.

17

3.2 Proof

We prove Theorem 3.4.

Proof. The proof divides into three main steps.

Existence of u The proof of the existence of a subsequence (uτk )k∈N
pointwise σ-converging to a locally absolutely continuous curve u follows
similar arguments as the proof of the existence of a generalized minimizing
movement in the classical scheme along a single functional ψ ([2], chapter 3).

The last estimate shows that there exist τk ↓ 0, A ∈ L2

loc([0, +∞)) such that

|U′τk| converges weakly in L2(0, T ) to A for all T > 0.

Now, we can apply the reﬁned version of Ascoli-Arzel`a theorem stated be-
low to conclude from the preceding estimates and from (3.2) that there exist
a further subsequence again denoted by (τk)k∈N and a curve u : [0, +∞) → S
such that

Lemma 3.6. (A reﬁned version of Ascoli-Arzel`a theorem, [2]) Let T > 0,
let K ⊂ S be a sequentially compact set w.r.t. σ, and let un : [0, T ] → S be
curves such that

lim

where C is an (at most) countable subset of [0, T ].

Then there exist nk ↑ +∞, u : [0, T ] → S such that

unk(t) σ

⇀ u(t) ∀t ∈ [0, T ], u is d-continuous in [0, T ] \ C .

It remains to prove that u is locally absolutely continuous. Using the

σ-lower semicontinuity of the distance d we obtain for all 0 ≤ s ≤ t

d(u(s), u(t)) ≤ lim inf
k→∞

d(uτk(s), uτk (t)) ≤ Z t

Thus, u is locally absolutely continuous with |u′| ≤ A L 1-a.e. and

3.3 Supplement to Theorem 3.4

Convergence condition The following convergence condition (3.15) in
case |∂−φ| is only a weak upper gradient for φ is the counterpart of the
continuity condition (2.11) in section 2.3:

⇀ v, sup

n∈N {χǫn,τn(vn), d(vn, v), φǫn(vn)} < +∞ ⇒ φǫn(vn) → φ(v) (3.15)

for τn → 0 (τn > 0), with χǫ,τ (·) := φǫ(·)−Yτ φǫ(·)
Proposition 3.7. Let the assumptions 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, and in addition
the convergence condition (3.15) be satisﬁed. Let u : [0, +∞) → S be con-
structed according to (3.9) in Theorem 3.4. Then the energy dissipation

of maximal slope for φ with respect to |∂−φ|.

In particular, if |∂−φ| is a weak upper gradient for φ, then u is a curve

22

Proof. Note that the calculations in the second step of the proof of Theorem
3.4 show that for every t > 0 and for L 1-a.e. s ∈ (0, t) there exists a further
subsequence (uτkl

)l∈N such that

Then, by using (3.15) and the same arguments as in the proof of the energy
inequality (3.11), we can conclude.
(cid:3)

Generalization to a non-uniform distribution of the error The proof
of Theorem 3.4 shows that we may replace the error γτ τ in the approximate
minimization problem (3.5) by a more general γ(n)
depending on n ∈ N.
Indeed, the convergence

τ

Nτ

Xj=1

γ(j)

(3.17)

for Nτ ∈ N as in the second step of the proof, is suﬃcient for our purposes.
Hence, we can extend our theory to a non-uniform distribution of the er-
ror and to the following relaxed minimizing movement scheme along (φǫ)ǫ>0:

For the sake of clear presentation, we come back to considering a uniform
distribution of the error in the remaining part of the paper. Note that all
the results in this paper can be obtained for a non-uniform distribution of
the error as well.

4 The case φǫ = φ˜ǫ for all ǫ, ˜ǫ > 0

The special case in which we have φǫ = φ˜ǫ for all ǫ, ˜ǫ > 0 is worth considering
in order to better understand Theorem 3.4 and our main assumption 3.3.
Moreover, we will obtain interesting relaxation results.

4.1 Assumption 3.3 with regard to a single functional

We give a positive answer to the question if there is an interrelation cor-
responding to assumption 3.3 between the (relaxed) minimizing movement
scheme along a single functional ψ : S → (−∞, +∞] and its relaxed slope .
Proposition 4.1. Let ψ : S → (−∞, +∞], D(ψ) 6= ∅, satisfy the following
assumptions:
(4.1)

ψ is d-lower semicontinuous,

and for small τ > 0 it holds that

Jτ ψ[u] 6= ∅ for all u ∈ S .

Then whenever u, uτ ∈ S (τ > 0) satisfy

it holds that

Proof. Note that (4.2) implies that there exist A, B > 0, u⋆ ∈ S such that

ψ(·) ≥ −A − Bd2(·, u⋆).

Let u, uτ ∈ S (τ > 0) satisfy

uτ

σ
⇀ u, sup

τ {ψ(uτ ), d(uτ , u)} < +∞.

For π ∈ (0, 1) we set vπ·τ ∈ Jπ·τ ψ[uτ ]. We have

d2(vπ·τ , uτ ) ≤ 2πτ (ψ(uτ ) − ψ(vπ·τ ))

≤ 2πτ (ψ(uτ ) + A + Bd2(vπ·τ , u⋆))

24

leading to

d2(vπ·τ , uτ )[1 − 2πτ B] − 4πτ Bd(uτ , u⋆)d(vπ·τ , uτ )
≤ 2πτ ψ(uτ ) + 2πτ A + 2πτ Bd2(uτ , u⋆).

We can conclude that

and (vπ·τ )τ >0 is an admissible test sequence in the deﬁnition of |∂−ψ|(u).

4.2 Relaxation results

Relaxed form of minimization We come back to the classical minimiz-
ing movement scheme for gradient ﬂows (section 2.3) along a single functional
used to construct curves of maximal slope [2]. Let us introduce a relaxed form
of minimization in each step of the scheme. Still we obtain curves of maximal
slope. Let ψ : S → (−∞, +∞] be given.

For every time step τ > 0, ﬁnd a sequence (un

τ )n∈N by the following

scheme.

uτ (0) = u0
τ .

(4.8)
(4.9)

Then the following holds.

Theorem 4.3. Let ψ satisfy assumption 2.7 and uτ : [0, +∞) → S (τ > 0)
be constructed according to (4.6) - (4.9). Then there exist a locally absolutely
continuous curve u : [0, +∞) → S and a subsequence (uτk )k∈N such that

uτk (t) σ

⇀ u(t) for all t ≥ 0

(4.10)

and u satisﬁes the initial condition

(4.11)
and the energy inequality (2.7) for all t ≥ 0. In particular, if |∂−ψ| is a
strong upper gradient for ψ, then

u(0) = u0

u is a curve of maximal slope for ψ with respect to |∂−ψ|.

(4.12)

26

Proof. We apply Theorem 3.4 with φǫ = φ = ψ for all ǫ > 0. Assumption 2.7
corresponds to the assumptions 3.1 and 3.2. It can be proved ([2], chapter
2) that assumption 2.7 implies that (4.2) holds for τ > 0 small enough.
Thus, Proposition 4.1 shows that assumption 3.3 is also satisﬁed in this
case.
(cid:3)

There is some possibility that the relaxed minimizing movement scheme
produces more curves of maximal slope than the classical scheme. We give a
simple example.
Example 4.4. We apply our scheme (4.6) - (4.7) to ψ(x) = − 1
α|x|α with
1 < α < 2, ψ : R → R, and initial values u0
τ = u0 = 0 for all τ > 0. Doing
so we also obtain the trivial solution u ≡ 0 to the corresponding gradient ﬂow
equation since the choice un
τ = 0 (τ > 0, n ∈ N) is admissible in (4.7). This
solution cannot be reached by the classical scheme.

The error order o(τ ) in (3.5) and (4.7) is optimal. The following example
shows that we cannot expect to obtain curves of maximal slope if we allow
an error greater than of order o(τ ).
Example 4.5. We consider ψ : R → R, ψ(x) = 1
u0
τ = u0 = 0 for all τ > 0. Let us choose u1
τ = τ and un
Then we have

for all 0 < τ < 1 and n ∈ N, and the limit curve u : [0, +∞) → R, u(t) = te−t
does not solve the corresponding gradient ﬂow equation.

Lower semicontinuous envelope relaxation Now, we consider a func-
tional ψ : S → (−∞, +∞] satisfying the coercivity and compactness con-
ditions (2.8) and (2.10), but for which the minimization problems in the
classical minimizing movement scheme for gradient ﬂows (section 2.3) need
not have any solutions due to missing lower semicontinuity (2.9).

However, the approximate minimization problems (4.7) are solvable and
we can follow the steepest descent movements in our relaxed scheme along
the functional ψ. They are closely related to the gradient ﬂow motion of the
lower semicontinuous envelope ψsc : S → (−∞, +∞] of ψ.

27

To be more precise, let ψsc : S → (−∞, +∞] be both the d-lower semi-
continuous and a weakened form of the σ-lower semicontinuous envelope of
the functional ψ, i.e.

sup
n,m

d(un, um) < +∞, un

ψ(un) ≥ ψsc(u)

(4.13)

and for all u ∈ D(ψ) there exists (vn)n∈N ⊂ S such that

d→ u, ψ(vn) → ψsc(u).

(4.14)

Moreover, let initial values u0

⇀ u0 ∈ D(ψ) (τ → 0) be given satisfying
(4.15)

τ , u0) < +∞, ψ(u0

τ ) → ψsc(u0).

d(u0

sup

τ

Theorem 4.6. We assume that ψ satisﬁes (2.8) and (2.10) and that ψsc is
given by (4.13) and (4.14). We construct uτ : [0, +∞) → S according to
(4.15), (4.7), (4.8) and (4.9).
Then there exist a locally absolutely continuous curve u : [0, +∞) → S

and a subsequence (uτk )k∈N such that

uτk (t) σ

⇀ u(t) for all t ≥ 0

and u satisﬁes the initial condition

u(0) = u0

and the energy inequality

(4.16)

(4.17)

ψsc(u(0)) − ψsc(u(t)) ≥

2Z t
0 |∂−ψsc|2(u(s)) ds +

1

2 Z t
0 |u′|2(s) ds (4.18)

for all t ≥ 0.

In particular, if the relaxed slope of ψsc is a strong upper gradient, then

u is a curve of maximal slope for ψsc with respect to |∂−ψsc|.

(4.19)

Proof. We apply Theorem 3.4 with φǫ = ψ for all ǫ > 0 and φ = ψsc. The
assumptions 3.1 and 3.2 are clearly satisﬁed.
It remains to be checked if
assumption 3.3 is fulﬁlled.

28

We can conclude from the fact that the conditions (2.8) and (2.10) hold
for the functional ψ and from (4.13), (4.14) that assumption 2.7 is satisﬁed
for the functional ψsc.
It can be proved [2] that if a functional satisﬁes
assumption 2.7 then it also satisﬁes (4.2). So for small τ > 0 we have

Hence, Proposition 4.1 is applicable to ψsc and it holds that

Jτ ψsc[w] 6= ∅ for all w ∈ S .

(cid:3)

We indirectly revealed that for small τ > 0 we have Yτ ψsc(w) = Yτ ψ(w)
for all w ∈ S . This equality can also be shown directly by means of the
theory of Γ-convergence.
In fact, we could have proved Theorem 4.6 as a
corollary of Theorem 4.3.

29

Restriction to a dense subset Now, let a functional ψ : S → (−∞, +∞]
satisfying assumption 2.7 with strong upper gradient |∂−ψ| and a dense sub-
set V ⊂ S such that

∀v ∈ D(ψ) ∃(vk)k∈N ⊂ V : vk

d→ v, ψ(vk) → ψ(v)

be given. Our relaxation results make it possible to restrict the approximate
minimization problems to this dense subset V ⊂ S , i.e. to replace (4.7) by

(ψ + IV )(un

τ ) +

2τ

d2(un

(4.21)

in which we set IV ≡ 0 on V , IV ≡ +∞ on S \ V . Thus, we construct
approximations uτ : [0, +∞) → V (with particular properties) to curves of
maximal slope for ψ with respect to |∂−ψ|. In the following example, the
desired property is higher regularity.

Example 4.7. Let Ω ⊂ Rn be bounded and open. We set

S = Lp(Ω) (1 ≤ p < +∞), σ = d, D(ψ) = W 1,p
L(x,∇u(x)) dx +ZΩ
if u ∈ W 1,p

j(x, u(x)) dx,

0 (Ω),

ψ(u) = ZΩ

0 (Ω)

with convex, lower semicontinuous L(x,·) : Rn → R, j(x,·) : R → R. We
suppose that L(x,·) satisﬁes a growth condition of order p, i.e.
that there
exist c1, c2, c3, c4 > 0 such that

c1|z|p − c2 ≤ L(x, z) ≤ c3|z|p + c4

for all x ∈ Rn, z ∈ Rn. Moreover, we suppose that j is bounded from below
and that there exists c > 0 such that

for all x ∈ Rn, z ∈ R.

We set

j(x, z) ≤ c(1 + |z|p)

V = C∞0 (Ω).

One can easily check that all the required assumptions are satisﬁed in this

example.

5 Convergence of gradient ﬂows

Let us suppose that we have functionals φǫ : S → (−∞, +∞] (ǫ > 0),
φ : S → (−∞, +∞] connected through a Γ(σ)-liminf inequality as in as-
sumption 3.2, with strong upper gradients |∂−φǫ|, |∂−φ|, and satisfying a
particular property which we call COGF-Property (Convergence Of Gradi-
ent Flows):

COGF-Property If ϑǫ : [0, +∞) → S is a curve of maximal slope for φǫ
with respect to |∂−φǫ| (ǫ > 0) and we have

ϑǫ(t) σ

⇀ ϑ(t) for all t ≥ 0,
φǫ(ϑǫ(0)) → φ(ϑ(0)),

(5.1)
(5.2)

for a curve ϑ : [0, +∞) → S , then ϑ is a curve of maximal slope for φ with
respect to |∂−φ|.

In addition, we suppose that there exist curves of maximal slope for φǫ
with respect to |∂−φǫ|, for which (5.1), (5.2) indeed hold. For this to be
guaranteed, a natural setting would include both some equi-coercivity and
combined compactness property such as in assumption 3.1 and some lower
semicontinuity and compactness property of the single functionals φǫ such as
(2.9) and (2.10).

Our expectation Intuitively, in this case, any choice ǫ = ǫ(τ ) in (3.4) -
(3.5) should be feasible in order to obtain the results of Theorem 3.4.

We specify this idea in the abstract situation that the COGF-Property is
a consequence of the established considerations by Sandier and Serfaty [20],
[21]. Indeed, our expectation is fulﬁlled:

Proposition 5.1. Let (φǫ)ǫ>0 satisfy the equi-coercivity condition (3.1) and
let the lower semicontinuity and compactness conditions (2.9) and (2.10) hold
for the single functionals φǫ. If the Serfaty-Sandier condition

uǫ

⇀ u ⇒ lim inf
ǫ→0

|∂−φǫ|(uǫ) ≥ |∂−φ|(u)

(5.3)

holds, then assumption 3.3 is satisﬁed for every choice ǫ = ǫ(τ ) → 0 (τ → 0).

31

Proof. Let ǫ(τ ) > 0, ǫ(τ ) → 0 and u, uτ ∈ S (τ > 0) be given such that

uτ

τ (cid:8)φǫ(τ )(uτ ), d(uτ , u)(cid:9) < +∞.
For π ∈ (0, 1) we set vπ·τ,τ ∈ Jπ·τ φǫ(τ )[uτ ]. Then it holds that

We applied (5.3) and we followed similar arguments as in the proof of propo-

(cid:3)

The λ-convex case If φ, φǫ (ǫ > 0) are λ-convex (λ ∈ R), the σ-topology
Γ→ φ, then
coincides with the topology induced by the distance d and φǫ
condition (5.4) on the local slopes can be proved [18]

uǫ → u ⇒ lim inf
ǫ→0

|∂φǫ|(uǫ) ≥ |∂φ|(u).

(5.4)

The Γ-liminf condition (5.5) on the local slopes discussed in [18] can be

viewed as discrete counterpart of the Serfaty-Sandier condition (5.3).

Similarly as Proposition 5.1, we can prove

Proposition 5.2. Let (φǫ)ǫ>0 satisfy the equi-coercivity condition (3.1) and
let the lower semicontinuity and compactness conditions (2.9) and (2.10)
hold for the single functionals φǫ.
If the following condition on the local
slopes holds

σ

uǫ

⇀ u ⇒ lim inf
ǫ→0

|∂φǫ|(uǫ) ≥ |∂φ|(u),

(5.5)

then assumption 3.3 is satisﬁed for every choice ǫ = ǫ(τ ) → 0 (τ → 0).

Again, we obtain that in our scheme (3.4)-(3.5) any choice ǫ = ǫ(τ ) is

feasible in order to apply Theorem 3.4.

In order to prove Proposition 5.1 and 5.2, it would be suﬃcient to im-
σ
pose the conditions (5.3) and (5.5) respectively on sequences uǫ
⇀ u with
supǫ {φǫ(uǫ), d(uǫ, u)} < +∞, and weaker conditions than (2.9) and (2.10).

32

Note In the special case considered in section 5, every choice ǫ = ǫ(τ ) is
possible. In general, the interrelation between the steepest descent movement
along a Γ-converging sequence of functionals and the gradient ﬂow motion of
its limit functional is more involved.

Various choices of (ǫ(τ ))τ >0 lead to diﬀerent motions not coincident with
the gradient ﬂow motion of the limit functional. For illustrative purposes, the
reader may have a look at (heuristical) comptutations of Jτ fǫ[·] (τ > 0, ǫ > 0)
for concrete examples of Γ-converging functionals fǫ in [5].

6 Existence of a suitable choice ǫ = ǫ(τ )

There always exists a sequence (ǫτ )τ >0 (ǫτ > 0) such that the following holds:
If we associate τ > 0 with ǫ = ǫ(τ ) ≤ ǫτ in the relaxed minimizing movement
scheme (3.4) - (3.5), our Theorem 3.4 with all its results is applicable.

Theorem 6.1. We assume that (S , d) is a separable, complete metric space
and the σ-topology coincides with the topology induced by the distance d.

Let functionals φ, φǫ : S → (−∞, +∞] (ǫ > 0) be given. We suppose

that (φǫ)ǫ>0 satisﬁes assumption 3.1 and φǫ

Γ→ φ, i.e.
φǫ(uǫ) ≥ φ(u) for all u, uǫ ∈ S , uǫ

d→ u,
d→ u and φǫ(˜uǫ) → φ(u).

lim inf

ǫ→0
∀u ∈ S ∃˜uǫ ∈ S : ˜uǫ

Then there exists a sequence (ǫτ )τ >0 with ǫτ > 0 such that our main
assumption 3.3 is satisﬁed for all choices (ǫ(τ ))τ >0 with ǫ(τ ) ≤ ǫτ (ǫ(τ ) → 0).
In particular, if we choose ǫ = ǫ(τ ) ≤ ǫτ for τ → 0 in (3.4) - (3.5), all the
results of Theorem 3.4 hold.

Comment on Theorem 6.1 The special feature of Theorem 6.1 is that
the sequence (ǫτ )τ >0 only depends on the velocity of Γ-convergence of the
functionals φǫ to the functional φ. We notice that the sequence (ǫτ )τ >0 in
Theorem 6.1 is completely independent of initial values u0
τ , u0 ∈ S and of
(approximate) minimizers un
τ in the (relaxed) minimizing movement scheme.
We establish a direct connection between the gradient ﬂow motion along a
Γ-converging sequence of functionals and the gradient ﬂow motion of its limit
functional.

33

Proof. We prove Theorem 6.1. Note that the functional φ satisﬁes assump-
tion 2.7 since (φǫ)ǫ>0 satisﬁes assumption 3.1 and φǫ Γ-converges to φ.

On a separable metric space, Γ-convergence is metrizable ([8], chapter 10)

for a certain class of functionals.
Lemma 6.2. (see [8]) Let us ﬁx a dense subset {xi : i ∈ N} of S , a se-
quence (κj)j∈N of positive real numbers converging to 0, and an increasing
homeomorphism Φ between [0, +∞] and [0, 1].
Then, for a sequence of functionals fn : S → [0, +∞] (n ∈ N) satisfying
(un)n∈N ⊂ S , sup
(6.1)
n∈N

fn(un) < +∞ ⇒ ∃u ∈ S , nk ↑ +∞ : unk

d→ u,

it holds that (fn)n∈N Γ-converges to a functional f : S → [0, +∞] (fn
if and only if we have

with

δ(fn, f ) :=

δ(fn, f ) → 0 (n → +∞),
∞Xi,j=1

2−i−j|Φ(Yκj fn(xi)) − Φ(Yκj f (xi))|.

We may assume that Φ is Lipschitz continuous.

Γ→ f )

(6.2)

(6.3)

Now, let (αk)k∈N with αk > 0 (k ∈ N) and αk → 0 (k → +∞) be given

and for ǫ, τ > 0, k ∈ N, deﬁne Fǫ,τ,αk, Fτ,αk : S → [0, +∞] by

Fǫ,τ,αk

:=

Fτ,αk

:=

φǫ − Yτ φǫ
φ − Yτ φ

τ

+ αk(φǫ + A + Bd2(·, u⋆)) + d(·, u⋆),
+ αk(φ + A + Bd2(·, u⋆)) + d(·, u⋆).

τ

Then, for τ ∈ (cid:0)0, 1

2B(cid:1) and αk > 0 ﬁxed, it holds that
Γ→ Fτ,αk (ǫ → 0).

Fǫ,τ,αk

We used the fact that Yτ φǫ converges locally uniformly to Yτ φ as ǫ → 0, which
follows from the Fundamental Theorem of Γ-convergence on the convergence
of minimum problems (see [4], [8]). The Fundamental Theorem is applicable
due to assumption 3.1 on (φǫ)ǫ>0.

34

At the end, we will be interested in the limit τ → 0, so in the following,

if we consider τ > 0, we tacitly suppose that τ ∈ (cid:0)0, 1
2B(cid:1).

Let (θτ )τ >0 with θτ > 0 for τ > 0 and θτ → 0 (τ → 0) be given.
Since (φǫ)ǫ>0 satisﬁes assumption 3.1, condition (6.1) holds for (Fǫ,τ,αk)ǫ>0.

We apply Lemma 6.2 and deduce that

δ(Fǫ,τ,αk, Fτ,αk) → 0 (ǫ → 0)

for all τ, αk > 0. Thus, for all τ, αk > 0 there exists ǫτ,αk > 0 such that

δ(Fη,τ,αk , Fτ,αk) ≤ θτ for all 0 < η ≤ ǫτ,αk .

(6.4)

Next, we show that we can choose ǫτ = ǫτ,αk independent of αk (k ∈ N)

in (6.4). For ﬁxed τ > 0 and for ǫk → 0 (ǫk > 0) we have

Fǫk,τ,αk

Fτ,αk

Γ→
Γ→

φ − Yτ φ
φ − Yτ φ

τ

τ

+ d(·, u⋆) (k → +∞),
+ d(·, u⋆) (k → +∞).

This means that the two families of functionals {Fǫ,τ,αk : ǫ > 0, k ∈ N} and
{Fτ,αk : k ∈ N} are uniformly Γ-equivalent. The notion of Γ-equivalence was
introduced by Braides and Truskinovsky [6].
It

Moreover, both (Fǫk,τ,αk)k∈N and (Fτ,αk )k∈N satisfy condition (6.1).

easily follows (see [6] for the corresponding statement) that

sup

k∈N |YκFǫ,τ,αk(x) − YκFτ,αk (x)| → 0 (ǫ → 0)

(6.5)

for all κ > 0, x ∈ S .
In view of deﬁnition (6.3) of δ(·,·) with Φ Lipschitz continuous, we can
conclude from (6.5) with basic straightforward arguments that for all τ > 0
there exists ǫτ > 0 such that

δ(Fη,τ,αk, Fτ,αk) ≤ θτ for all 0 < η ≤ ǫτ , αk > 0.

(6.6)

We want to pass on to the limit τ → 0.

35

Let us consider (Fτ,αk)τ >0 for αk > 0 ﬁxed.

On a separable metric space, Γ-convergence is compact (see [4], [8]). Thus,

every subsequence of (Fτ,αk )τ >0 admits a Γ-converging (sub)subsequence.

If we have

Fτn,αk

Γ→ Σ (n → +∞)

for some functional Σ : S → [0, +∞] and a subsequence τn → 0, then the
following facts hold.
As (Fτ,αk)τ >0 satisﬁes condition (6.1), we can apply Lemma 6.2 to deduce

that

δ(Fτn,αk, Σ) → 0 (n → +∞).

(6.7)

It can be proved [2] that if a functional satisﬁes assumption 2.7, then
it also satisﬁes (4.2). Hence, Proposition 4.1 is applicable to φ. By the
deﬁnition of Γ-convergence it holds that

Σ(u) = inf(cid:26)lim inf

n→+∞

Fτn,αk(uτn) : uτn

d→ u(cid:27) .

We can conclude that

Σ(u) ≥

1
2|∂−φ|2(u) + αk(φ(u) + A + Bd2(u, u⋆)) + d(u, u⋆)

(6.8)

for u ∈ S .

Now, we can put together all the building blocks of our proof.

Let (ǫ(τ ))τ >0 with ǫ(τ ) ≤ ǫτ and ǫ(τ ) → 0 (τ → 0) be given with (ǫτ )τ >0

as in (6.6).

We consider (Fǫ(τ ),τ,αk)τ >0 for an arbitrary but ﬁxed αk > 0.

Let a subsequence τn → 0 and a functional Σ : S → [0, +∞] be given

with

Fτn,αk

Γ→ Σ (n → +∞),

i.e. as in the preceding considerations on (Fτ,αk)τ >0.

36

In this case we also have

Fǫ(τn),τn,αk

Γ→ Σ (n → +∞).

In fact, this follows from (6.6), (6.7), the triangle inequality

δ(Fǫ(τn),τn,αk, Σ) ≤ δ(Fǫ(τn),τn,αk, Fτn,αk) + δ(Fτn,αk, Σ).

and Lemma 6.2 (note that condition (6.1) is satisﬁed for (Fǫ(τn),τn,αk)n∈N).

All in all, remembering the compactness of Γ-convergence on a separable

metric space, we obtain

lim inf
τ→0

Fǫ(τ ),τ,αk(uτ ) ≥

1
2|∂−φ|2(u) + αk(φ(u) + A + Bd2(u, u⋆)) + d(u, u⋆)

for all u, uτ ∈ S (τ > 0) with uτ

d→ u.

Now, we can directly deduce that assumption 3.3 holds.

Let u, uτ ∈ S (τ > 0) be given with

uτ

d→ u, sup

τ

φǫ(τ )(uτ ) < +∞,

and set C := supτ (cid:0)φǫ(τ )(uτ ) + A + Bd2(uτ , u⋆)(cid:1) < +∞. It follows from the

preceding steps that

The proof of assumption 3.3, and thus, of Theorem 6.1 is complete.

7 Two ﬁnite dimensional examples

Let a C 1-function φ : R → R be given, with

φ(·) ≥ −A − Bd2(·, u⋆)

for some A, B > 0, u⋆ ∈ R. (We write d(x, y) := |x − y|.)
Then assumption 2.7 is satisﬁed and the relaxed slope |∂−φ| = |φ′| is a
strong upper gradient for φ. It can be proved [2] that if a functional satisﬁes
assumption 2.7, then it also satisﬁes (4.2). We consider two examples of
perturbations φǫ : R → R of φ with φǫ
Example 7.1. Let an arbitrary function a : R → [0, +∞) be given and deﬁne

Γ→ φ.

φǫ(x) = φ(x) + a(x) cos2(cid:16) x
ǫ(cid:17) .

If we choose ǫ = ǫ(τ ) with ǫ(τ )
τ → 0 (τ → 0) in our scheme (3.4) - (3.5),
then we can apply Theorem 3.4 and any curve u constructed in accordance
with (3.9) solves

u′(t) = −φ′(u(t)) for all t ∈ (0, +∞), u(0) = u0.

Proof. We only have to check assumption 3.3. Let u, uτ ∈ R (τ > 0) be given
such that

uτ → u, sup

Example 7.2. Let functions ζǫ : R → R be given with

ζǫ(·) ≥ − ˜A − ˜Bd2(·, ˜u⋆)

for some ˜A, ˜B > 0, ˜u⋆ ∈ R and such that (ζǫ)ǫ>0 converges locally uniformly
to a continuous function ζ : R → R. We deﬁne
φǫ(x) = φ(x) + ǫζǫ(x).

If we choose ǫ = ǫ(τ ) with ǫ(τ )
τ ≤ C for some C > 0 in (3.4) - (3.5), then we
can apply Theorem 3.4 and any curve u constructed in accordance with (3.9)
solves

u′(t) = −φ′(u(t)) for all t ∈ (0, +∞), u(0) = u0.

Proof. We only have to check assumption 3.3. Let u, uτ ∈ R (τ > 0) be given
such that

uτ → u, sup

τ

φǫ(τ )(uτ ) < +∞.

Again, it suﬃces to show (7.1). We set vτ ∈ Jτ φ[uτ ] and as in example 7.1 it
holds that vτ → u (τ → 0). We have

8 Perturbations, time-space discretizations

We return to the general case of a complete metric space (S , d) with a (com-
patible) topology σ on it, in accordance with the topological assumptions of
section 2.2, and study some stimulating aspects.

8.1 Perturbations
Let a functional φ : S → (−∞, +∞] satisfying assumption 2.7 and func-
tionals Pǫ : S → (−∞, +∞] (ǫ > 0) be given with
Pǫ(·) ≥ − ˜A − ˜Bd2(·, ˜u⋆)

(8.1)
for some ˜A, ˜B > 0, ˜u⋆ ∈ S . We suppose that for ǫn → 0 (ǫn > 0) it holds
that

n∈N |Pǫn(un)| < +∞.

sup
n,m

d(un, um) < +∞, un

We deﬁne

φǫ(u) = φ(u) + ǫPǫ(u).

(8.3)
The functionals φǫ : S → (−∞, +∞] (ǫ > 0) satisfy assumption 3.1, and
moreover, assumption 3.2 holds. In order to apply Theorem 3.4 it remains
to check assumption 3.3:

Proposition 8.1. Let φ and φǫ = φ + ǫPǫ be given as above. If we choose
ǫ = ǫ(τ ) with ǫ(τ )
τ → 0 (τ → 0), then assumption 3.3 is satisﬁed with this
choice ǫ = ǫ(τ ) (τ > 0). In particular, all the results of Theorem 3.4 hold.

Proof. We prove assumption 3.3 with similar arguments as in example 7.2.
Let u, uτ ∈ S (τ > 0) be given with

uτ

σ
⇀ u, sup

τ (cid:8)φǫ(τ )(uτ ), d(uτ , u)(cid:9) < +∞.

We have already remarked several times that if a functional satisﬁes as-
sumption 2.7, Proposition 4.1 is applicable to it. Hence, in order to prove
assumption 3.3, it suﬃces to show

φǫ(τ )(uτ ) − Yτ φǫ(τ )(uτ )

In particular, if |∂−φ| is a strong upper gradient for φ, the relaxed min-
imizing movement scheme (3.4) - (3.5) along (φ + ǫPǫ)ǫ>0 leads to curves of
maximal slope for φ with respect to |∂−φ|.
Remark on the choice ǫ = ǫ(τ ) Note that other choices ǫ = ǫ(τ ) (e.g. of
order O(τ )) might be possible besides, depending on the special features of
the functionals Pǫ. Indeed, in order to prove assumption 3.3, the following
condition is suﬃcient:

Whenever (uτ )τ >0, (vτ )τ >0 ⊂ S satisfy
τ (cid:26) d(uτ , vτ )
√τ

σ

uτ , vτ

then it holds that

Remark on condition (8.2)

If the σ-topology coincides with the topology

8.2 Restriction to bounded subsets

Step by step, we have gained the impression that the deciding factor in our
theory is the local behaviour of the sequence of functionals under consider-
ation, whereas its global behaviour appears to be irrelevant.

Indeed, let functionals φ, φǫ : S → (−∞, +∞] (ǫ > 0) be given satisfying
the assumptions 3.1, 3.2 and assumption 3.3 with the choice ǫ = ǫ(τ ), and
let (r(ǫ))ǫ>0 be an arbitrary sequence of positive real numbers r(ǫ) with
r(ǫ) ↑ +∞ (ǫ → 0). For u⋆⋆ ∈ S arbitrary but ﬁxed, we deﬁne

˜φǫ = φǫ + I{d(u⋆⋆,·)≤r(ǫ)},

(8.5)
in which we set IVǫ ≡ 0 on Vǫ, IVǫ ≡ +∞ on S \Vǫ, for Vǫ = {d(u⋆⋆,·) ≤ r(ǫ)}.
Then the functionals φ, ˜φǫ : S → (−∞, +∞] (ǫ > 0) satisfy the as-
sumptions 3.1, 3.2 (this is obviously true), and moreover, we can show that
assumption 3.3 holds for φ, ( ˜φǫ)ǫ>0 as well, with the same choice ǫ = ǫ(τ ).
Proof. Let u, uτ ∈ S (τ > 0) be given with

uτ

σ
⇀ u, sup

τ n ˜φǫ(τ )(uτ ), d(uτ , u)o < +∞.

In order to prove assumption 3.3, it suﬃces to show

˜φǫ(τ )(uτ ) − Yτ

τ

We set vτ ∈ S with

φǫ(τ )(vτ ) +

1
2τ

d2(vτ , uτ ) ≤ Yτ φǫ(τ )(uτ ) + τ 2.

It holds that d(uτ , vτ ) → 0 (τ → 0). This can be proved with similar
arguments as at the beginning of the proof of Proposition 4.1. Thus, there
exists η > 0 such that

for all 0 < τ < η. So we have

vτ ∈ {d(u⋆⋆,·) ≤ r(ǫ(τ ))}

˜φǫ(τ )(uτ ) − Yτ ˜φǫ(τ )(uτ )
+
Yτ φǫ(τ )(uτ ) − Yτ ˜φǫ(τ )(uτ )

for all τ ∈ (0, η). The proof is ﬁnished.

(cid:3)

The preceding proof also reveals that whenever the convergence condition

(3.15) is satisﬁed for φ, (φǫ)ǫ>0, then it is satisﬁed for φ, ( ˜φǫ)ǫ>0 too.

All in all, we obtain that we can always replace (3.5) by

ǫ(τ ))(un

) + γτ τ (8.6)

with Vǫ(τ ) = {d(u⋆⋆,·) ≤ r(ǫ(τ ))}, and still, all the results of section 3 hold.

8.3 Time-space discretizations along a single functional
Let a functional φ : S → (−∞, +∞] satisfying assumption 2.7 and subsets
Wǫ ⊂ S (ǫ > 0) be given. We deﬁne

φǫ = φ + IWǫ,

(8.7)

in which we set IWǫ ≡ 0 on Wǫ, IWǫ ≡ +∞ on S \ Wǫ.

The assumptions 3.1, 3.2 are clearly satisﬁed in this case. We want to
derive conditions on (Wǫ)ǫ>0 and (ǫ(τ ))τ >0 such that assumption 3.3 holds:

Let u, uτ ∈ S (τ > 0) be given with

uτ

σ
⇀ u, sup

τ (cid:8)φǫ(τ )(uτ ), d(uτ , u)(cid:9) < +∞.

In view of Proposition 4.1, it would suﬃce to show

Example 8.2. We set S = L2(Ω) with Ω ⊂ RN and deﬁne the functional
φ : L2(Ω) → (−∞, +∞], D(φ) = H 1(Ω),
2 ZΩ |∇u(x)|2 dx +ZΩ

f (x, u(x)) dx, if u ∈ H 1(Ω).

φ(u) =

Let us suppose that there exist c1, c2 > 0 such that f : Ω × R → R satisﬁes

|f (x, w) − f (x, z)| ≤ c1(1 + |z| + |w|)|z − w|,

f (x, z) ≥ −c2(1 + |z|2)

for all x ∈ Ω, w, z ∈ RN .

Then the conditions (8.9), (8.10) hold for wτ ∈ Wǫ(τ ) with

k∇wτkL2(Ω) ≤ k∇vτkL2(Ω) ,
kvτ − wτkL2(Ω)

9 Some ﬁnal remarks

We would like to mention possible generalizations of our theory which we
have not considered so far for the sake of clear presentation.

The theory can be easily extended to p-curves of maximal slope (see [2]
for the deﬁnition of p-curves of maximal slope) with p ∈ (1, +∞), as well as
to time discretizations with non-equidistant time steps.

Note that we do not use the special structure of the relaxed slope in the
proof of Theorem 3.4. Section 3 and the ideas of section 5 remain valid if we
replace |∂−φ| by some upper gradient g : S → [0, +∞].

and appropriately adapt the assumptions of section 3. Then the proof of
Theorem 3.4 can be adapted as well in this case, with a yet reﬁned version
of Ascoli-Arzel`a Theorem. The ideas of section 5 remain valid too.

However, we do not want to expound the possible generalizations of our
theory with regard to the topology, just give an impetus in case diﬀerent
topological assumptions are of interest.
