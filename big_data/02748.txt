Renormalization and periods in perturbative Algebraic

Quantum Field Theory

Kasia Rejzner

March 29, 2016

In this paper I give an overview of mathematical structures appearing in perturbative
algebraic quantum ﬁeld theory (pAQFT) and I show how these relate to certain periods.
pAQFT is a mathematically rigorous framework that allows to build models of physi-
cally relevant quantum ﬁeld theories on a large class of Lorentzian manifolds. The basic
objects in this framework are functionals on the space of ﬁeld conﬁgurations and renor-
malization method used is the Epstein-Glaser (EG) renormalization. The main idea in
the EG approach is to reformulate the renormalization problem, using functional analytic
tools, as a problem of extending almost homogeneously scaling distributions that are well
deﬁned outside some partial diagonals in Rn. Such an extension is not unique, but it
gives rise to a unique “residue”, understood as an obstruction for the extended distribu-
tion to scale almost homogeneously. Physically, such scaling violations are interpreted
as contributions to the β function.

1 Functionals

Let M be the D-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, i.e. RD with the metric

η = diag(1,−1, . . . ,−1

) .

Deﬁne the conﬁguration space E of the theory as the space of smooth sections of a vector
= Γ(E π−→ M). Fixing E speciﬁes the particle content of
bundle E over M, i.e. E
the model under consideration. In this paper we will consider only the scalar ﬁeld, i.e.
E = C∞(M, R). The ﬁeld conﬁgurations are denoted by ϕ. For future reference, deﬁne
c (M, R) the space of smooth compactly supported functions on M and more

Let C∞(E, C) denote the space of functionals on E that are smooth in the sense of
Bastiani [Bas64, Nee06]. An important class of functionals is provided by the local ones.
Deﬁnition 1.1. A functional F ∈ C∞(E, C) is called local (an element of Floc) if for
each ϕ ∈ E there exists k ∈ N such that

β(jk

where jk

x(ϕ) is the k-th jet prolongation of ϕ and β is a density-valued function on the

The following deﬁnition introduces the notion of spacetime localization of a functional.
Deﬁnition 1.2. The spacetime support supp F of a functional F ∈ C∞(E, C) is deﬁned
by

supp F

.
= {x ∈ M|∀ neighborhoods U of x ∃ϕ, ψ ∈ E, supp ψ ⊂ U ,

such that F (ϕ + ψ) 6= F (ϕ)} .

Derivatives of smooth compactly-supported functionals are distributions with com-

pact support1, i.e.

F (n)(ϕ) ∈ E′(Mn, C) ≡ E′ C(Mn) ,

∀ϕ ∈ E , n ∈ N .

If F is local then each F (n)(ϕ) is a distribution supported on the thin diagonal

Dn

.
= {(x1, . . . , xn) ∈ Mn, x1 = ··· = xn} .

(2)

Local functionals are important, since they are used to model interactions in perturbative
QFT. In the Epstein-Glaser approach, interaction is ﬁrst restricted to a compact region
to avoid the IR problem and subsequently extended by taking the adiabatic limit. In this
work we are interested in the UV (i.e. short distance) behavior of the theory, so we leave
this last step out.

One can deﬁne various important classes of functionals by formulating conditions on
the singularity structures of their derivatives F (n)(ϕ) ∈ E′ C(Mn). A notion used in this
context is that of a wavefront set. For a given distribution u ∈ D′(Rn), its wavefront set
WF(u) contains information about points in Rn at which u is singular, but also about
directions in the momentum space (i.e. after the Fourier transform) in which bu(k) fails

In other words, WF(u) characterizes singular directions of
to decay suﬃciently fast.
u. For a pedagogical introduction to WF sets see [BD14]. Knowing the WF sets of
distributions u1, u2 one can apply the criterion due to Hörmander [Hör03] to check if the
pointwise product of u1, u2 is well deﬁned. This motivates using WF sets of functional
derivatives F (n)(ϕ) to distinguish classes of “well-behaving” functionals. One such class
is called microcausal functionals Fµc. For the precise deﬁnition see [BDF09] and [Rej16]
for possible modiﬁcations of this notion. For the purpose of this paper, it is enough to
know that Floc ⊂ Fµc and that some important algebraic structure are well deﬁned on
this space.

1Prime always denotes the topological dual, so E′(Mn) is the space of continuous linear maps from
E(Mn) to R and similarly, E′(Mn, C) is the space of continuous linear maps to C. E(Mn) is always
understood as equipped with its natural Fréchet topology. It is a standard result in functional analysis
that the dual of the space of smooth functions is exactly the space of distributions with compact support.

2 The S-matrix and time-ordered products

In the next step we introduce the S-matrix. Since we work perturbatively, the S-matrix
is understood as a formal power series in the coupling constant λ and a Laurant series in
, with coeﬃcents in smooth functionals. First we introduce the time-ordered products.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Time ordered products are multilinear maps Tn : F⊗n
satisfying:

loc → Fµc[[]], n ∈ N,

1. Causal factorisation property

Tn(F1, . . . , Fn) = Tk(F1, . . . , Fk) ⋆ Tn−k(Fk+1, . . . , Fn) ,

if the supports supp Fi, i = 1, . . . , k of the ﬁrst k entries do not intersect the past
of the supports supp Fj, j = k + 1, . . . , n of the last n − k entries. Here ⋆ is the
operator product of the quantum theory deﬁned by

δ2

δϕδϕ′ EF (ϕ)G(ϕ′)|ϕ′=ϕ ,

where ∆+ is the Wightman 2-point function.

2. T0 = 1, T1 = id.

3. Symmetry: For a purely bosonic theory Tns are symmetric in their arguments. If

the fermions are present, Tns are graded-symmetric.

4. Field independence: Tn(F1, . . . , Fn), as a functional on E, depends on ϕ only

via the functional derivatives of F1, . . . , Fn, i.e.

Tn(F1, . . . , Fn) =

i

is the Tay-

lor series expansion of the functional Fi up to the N -th order.

We refer to these conditions as the Epstein-Glaser (EG) axioms.

Deﬁnition 2.2. The formal S-matrix is a map from Floc to Fµc[[λ]](()) deﬁned as

Let (Floc)⊗n

trivially extend to arbitrary local functionals, due to singularities of the Feynman prop-
agator. Instead, one has to use more sophisticated analytical tools, which we will review
in the next section. We will refer to (4) as the non-renormalized n-fold time-ordered
product and the problem of extending Tn to arbitrary local functional is referred to as
the renormalization problem.

To organize the combinatorics present in the construction of time-ordered products,
it is convenient to write them in terms of Feynman graphs. To see how this comes about,
we use the identity

(ϕ1, . . . , ϕn), a compactly supported distribution in the variables xe,i, i ∈ ∂e, e ∈ E(Γ)
with support on the partial diagonal

DiagΓ = {xe,i = xf,i, i ∈ ∂e ∩ ∂f, e, f ∈ E(Γ)} ⊂ M2|E(Γ)| .

e,v = 0 for all v ∈ V (Γ), so

function of (xrel

Let YΓ denote the vector space spanned by derivatives of the Dirac delta distributions
∂βδrel, where β ∈ N
and let D(DiagΓ, YΓ) denote the graded space of test
functions on DiagΓ with values in YΓ. With this notation we have δΓF ∈ D(DiagΓ, YΓ)
and if F ∈ (Floc)⊗n
pds, then δΓF is supported on DiagΓ \ DIAG, where DIAG is the large
diagonal:
DIAG = {z ∈ DiagΓ|∃v, w ∈ V (Γ), v 6= w : zv = zw} .

We can therefore write (6) in the form

1

Sym(Γ)htΓ, δΓi = XﬁniteDf β∂βδrel, tΓE

where tΓ is written in terms of centre of mass and relative coordinates. To see that this
expression is well deﬁned, note that we can move all the partial derivatives ∂β to tΓ by
formal partial integration. Then the contraction with δrel is just the pullback through
the diagonal map ρΓ : DiagΓ → M2|E(Γ)| by

In this and the next section we will consider the simplest situation, where the free
theory is the free massless scalar ﬁeld and the possible interactions are local functionals
F1, . . . , Fn that depend on the ﬁeld itself but not on its derivatives. Without the loss of
generality we can assume them to be monomials, i.e. of the form

F (ϕ) =Z f (x)ϕ(x)ldDx ,

where f ∈ D. Such a functional can be graphically represented as a vertex of valence l,
decorated by the test function f .

The distributions we need to extend are then uΓ = ρ∗

We can write the explicit expression for uΓ using the following rules:

1. Choose a vertex of Γ and label it as x0 = 0. Label the remaining vertices with

variables x1, . . . , xn−1, where n = |V (Γ)|.

5

2. Assign the Feynman propagator ∆F(xi, xj) to each edge e ∈ E(Γ), where xi, xj ∈

∂e.

Because of the translational symmetry the Feynman propagator ∆F(x, y) depends only
on the diﬀerence x − y. Explicitly it is given by

∆F(x, y) = (−1)

We have seen how to reduce the renormalization problem to extension of distributions.
The construction of Tns proceeds inductively. Given renormalized time-ordered products
of order k < n we can use the causal factorisation property to ﬁx the time-ordered
products at order n up to the thin diagonal Dn (see (2)). On the level of graphs it
means that after renormalizing all the distributions uγ coresponding to proper subgraphs
γ ⊂ Γ, the renormlization problem for uΓ is now the extension of a distribution deﬁned
everywhere outside the thin diagonal of the graph Γ deﬁned as the subset of DiagΓ with
all the variables equal. Because of the translation symmetry, this is in fact extension
problem for a distribution deﬁned everywhere outside the origin.

3 Distributional residues and periods

On the technical side, the extension problem for uΓ is the extension problem for almost
homogenous distributions [Ste71, BF00, HW02, BDF09, NST13].
Deﬁnition 3.1. We say that a distribution u ∈ D′(RN \ {0}) scales almost homoge-
neously, if (ρ d
dρ )k+1ραu(ρ.) = 0 for some k ∈ N0 (called scaling order), α ∈ R (called
scaling degree)

6

satisﬁes

i=1 xi ∂

The almost homogeneous scaling relation can also be written in terms of the Euler
∂xi , namely a distribution with scaling degree α and order k

operator E = Pd
while (E + α)ku 6= 0.
Example 3.2. For a graph Γ with n vertices the distribution u ≡ uΓ that we need to
extend belongs to D′(RN \ {0}), where N = (n − 1)D and D is the dimension of M.

(E + α)k+1u = 0 ,

Let u be an almost homogeneously scaling distribution. If α < N or l ∈ Z, then there
exists a unique extension to a distribution on RN . Otherwise, there exists a non-unique
extension ¯u ∈ D′(RN ) of u and

= (E + α)k+1 ¯u = X|β|=α−N

cβ∂βδ ,

where β ∈ NN

0 is a multiindex. The homogeneous diﬀerential operator

X|β|=α−N

cβ∂β

doesn’t depend on the choice of the extension ¯u. We will call it the residue of u and
denote it by Res(u), so that

(E + α)k+1 ¯u = Res(u)δ .

Coeﬃcients of the diﬀerential operator Res(u) can be explicitly computed using the
construction of ¯u proposed in [Hol08, NST13]. Let us outline the main ideas behind
this construction. First, note that the almost homogeneous scaling implies that the
distributional kernel of u can be written as

u(rx) =

kXm=0Z r−l (log r)m

m!

vm(x)f (rx)

r > 0 ,

(9)

where vm = (E + α)mu. Let hu, fi denote the dual pairing between the distribution u
and the test function f ∈ D(RN \ {0}). This pairing is usually realized as the integral
(10)

u(x)f (x)dN x .

hu, fi =ZMn

We can rewrite this integral using the representation (9). First, choose a compact N − 1
dimensional hypersurface around the origin, homoeomorphic to the (Euclidean) sphere
SN −1 that intersects each orbit of the scaling transformation x 7→ µx exactly once. Note
that the map R+ × Σ ∋ (r, ˆx) 7→ rˆx ∈ RN \ {0} is a diﬀeomorphism.
Using microlocal analysis techniques [Hör03] one can show that distributions vm ap-
pearing in (9) have well deﬁned restrictions to Σ (see [Hol08], section 3.3). Following

7

[Hol08] we denote points on Σ by ˆx and write the restriction of vm simply as vm(ˆx).
Next, deﬁne for r > 0 the following space

Σr

.
= {rˆx ∈ RN|ˆx ∈ Σ} .

Denote the natural inclusion of Σr into RN by ir. We introduce a (N − 1)-form Ω on
RN by

Ω(x) =

factor is omitted. We can now write

where xa are components of x ∈ RN . The caret symbolb means that the corresponding

dN x =

rΩ .

Let ρΣ : RN \ {0} denote the smooth function deﬁned by the condition

ρΣ(x) ∈ Σ .

We obtain a measure on Σ by setting

dσ(ˆx) = ρΣ(x)−N Ω(x) ,

and express the pairing (10) as

is a smooth test function on R+, with a support bounded away from 0 and can be
arbitrarily continued to a distribution on R\{0}. The renormalization problem has now
been reduced to extension of the distribution θ(r)rN −1−l(log r)m on R. This is done by
means of diﬀerential renormalization (also called analytic renormalization). For details
see [GBL00, NST13, Spe71]. The idea is to consider ﬁrst the extension of the distribution
θ(r)rN −1−l+ε(log r)m for a complex, non integer N − 1 − l + ε. If we require the almost
homogeneous scaling, then the extension exists and is unique. Next we expand the
resulting extended distribution in ε and subtract the pole part.

Let us come back to our original extension problem for u ∈ D′(RN \ {0}). It was
proven in [NST13] (see also [Hol08, Kel10, DFKR14]) that an extension ¯u of an almost
homogeneously scaling distribution u of order k and degree α to an everywhere-deﬁned
distribution is obtained by setting

As a special case we can consider a distribution with scaling degree α = N and scaling
order 0. In this case

u(ˆx)dσ(ˆx) ,

(11)

so it is a special case of the Wodzicki residue [Wod84, Wod87].

For a graph Γ with n vertices and no derivatives decorating the edges, the scaling

degree of the distribution uΓ is given by the formula

We deﬁne the divergence degree of a graph Γ by

αΓ = (D − 2)|E(Γ)|

ωΓ = αΓ − (|V (Γ)| − 1)D .

Deﬁnition 3.3. A graph Γ is called superﬁcially divergent if ωΓ ≥ 0.

Hence graphs with αΓ = N are characterized by the condition

(D − 2)|E(Γ)| = (|V (Γ)| − 1)D .

(12)

Note that the loop number of a graph (the ﬁrst Betti number) is given by h1 = |E(Γ)| −
|V (Γ)| + 1, so the above condition can be also expressed as

|E(Γ)| =

D
2

h1 .

In four dimensions (D = 4) this reduces to |E(Γ)| = 2h1. If Γ satisﬁes (12) and has
no superﬁcially divergent subgraphs (here a subgraph γ ⊂ Γ is speciﬁed by choosing a
subset of vertices of Γ and taking all the edges connecting these), then it has scaling
degree αΓ = 0 and scaling order kΓ = 0. Such graphs coincide with primitive graphs in
the Connes-Kreimer approach, if we restrict to D = 4 and ﬁx the interaction.

Remark 3.4. The class of primitive graphs in the Epstein-Glaser Hopf algebra [Pin00,
Kel10, GBL00, DFKR14] diﬀers from the class of primitive graphs in the Connes-Kreimer
approach. As an example consider the sunset graph, which has |E(Γ)| = 4 and h1 = 3,
but is primitive in the Epstein-Glaser Hopf algebra.

9

The following proposition provides a link between periods investigated in the Connes-

Kreimer framework and a class of distributional residues appearing in pAQFT.

Proposition 3.5. Let Γ be a graph with |E(Γ)| = 2h1 and such that every proper subgraph
γ satisﬁes |E(Γ)| > 2h1. Then the distributional residue Res uΓ is given by

Res uΓ = c0 = i(2D−1)(|V |−1)

with each 1 a unit matrix of dimension |V (Γ)| − 1. Let us comment on the above
formula in a bit more detail. The Schwinger trick is used to write the denominator of
the integrand as a sum of terms quadratic in x (i.e. a quadratic form) and the change
of variables allows to put that quadratic form in a standard form Ξ(x, x). The Jacobi
determinant which arises from this change of variables can be then conveniently written
in terms of the dual graph polynomial ΨΓ (see [BW10] and references therein).

The ﬁrst integral in (13) is easy to evaluate. It is the residue of the distribution

t(x) =

2 −1)|E(Γ)|

on (R(D−2)|E(Γ)|, Ξ), with scaling degree 0 and scaling grade 0. Using, for example
[BDF09, Lemma C.2], we obtain

Res t = i(D−1)(|V (Γ)|−1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)S|E(Γ)|(D−2)−1(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) .

10

With this result and the formula for the volume of a sphere in 4l− 1 dimensions we arrive
at

c0 = i(2D−1)(|V (Γ)|−1)

(4π)|E(Γ)|Z∆ |ΨΓ|−D/2 .

In particular, for D = 4 we have

c0 = (−i)(|V (Γ)|−1)

Example 3.6. The simplest example is the ﬁsh graph in 4 dimensions:

The scaling degree and the scaling order vanish, so from proposition 3.5 we obtain

Proposition 3.5 allows to reduce the problem of computing a large class of distribu-
tional residues to the problem of evaluating periods arising from graph polynomials, of
the form discussed in [Sch10, BEK06, Bro09, AM09].

Let us come back to the general case. Let Γ be a graph with ωΓ ≥ 0. If it contains
proper subgraphs with ωγ ≥ 0, then one has to renormalize these ﬁrst and subsititute
the result to the expression for tΓ. If overlapping divergences are present, a partition of
unity is required (see example 4.16 in [DFKR14]). A distribution constructed this way
is denoted by ˜uΓ and it was shown in [HW01] that the property of almost homogeneous
scaling is preserved in the recursive procedure of renormalization of proper subgraphs.
Hence ˜uΓ is an almost homogeneously scaling distribution and the general formula for
its residue is

Res(˜uΓ) = X|β|=α−N

cβ∂β ,

where

cβ

.

β!ZΣ
= (−1)α−N 1

ˆxβ(E + α)k ˜uΓ(ˆx)dσ(ˆx) ,

(14)

If a graph is EG primitive, then k = 0, ˜uΓ = uΓ and the residue is uniquely determined
by the graph. Residues for EG primitive graphs which are not CK primitive can be
obtained by using the fact that coeﬃcients cβ are Lorenz invariant. This implies that
integrals (14) can be reduced to scalar integrals multiplying appropriate powers of ηµν .

Example 3.9. Consider the sunset diagram in 4 dimensions:

We have m = 0 and α = 8. This implies that |β| = 4 so we need to compute

cµναβ =

1

(2π)84!ZΣ

(x2 − i0)4 dσ(x) .

The Lorenz invariance and the symmetry of the problem imply that

In fact there is a diﬀerent, more direct, way to obtain residues for all the “sunset”
type diagrams with arbitryary number of lines. For details see [NST13, BDF09]. The

In [BDF09] the breaking of the homogeneous scaling is shown to relate to the deﬁnition
of the β-function. In this section we review the main ideas of that argument.

In the ﬁrst step we generalize the discussion from the previous sections from the
massless to the massive scalar ﬁeld. For studying the scaling properties, it is crucial to
work with time-ordered products that are smooth in mass. This is, unfortunately, not
the case if we use the standard Feynman propagator ∆F. To rectify this, we replace
in our framework the 2-point function ∆+ with a Hadamard 2-point function H and
the Feynman propagator ∆F with a corresponding modiﬁed Feynman propagator H F.
Crucially, H and H F are smooth in mass. The choice of these objects is unique up to a
parameter M > 0 with the dimension of mass. Explicit formula for H F
M was derived in
[BDF09] and it reads:

The non-uniqueness of H and H F forces one to use a bit more abstract construction

to deﬁne the observables and time-ordered product.

Deﬁnition 4.1. For a mass m we deﬁne a family of algebras A(m)M
labeled by M > 0, where H ≡ H m

M and ⋆H is deﬁned by

Diﬀerent choices of the Hadamard 2-point function for a given mass m diﬀer by a

smooth function, i.e. H m

between the algebras A(m)M1 and A(m)M2. We are now ready to deﬁne the algebra of
observables for a ﬁxed mass.

Deﬁnition 4.2. A(m), the algebra of observables for mass m consists of families A =
(AM )M >0, where AM ∈ A(m)M and we have AM1 = αm

(AM2).

M1M2

We can identify abstract elements of the algebra A(m) with concrete functionals in

M is the appropriate Hadamard 2-point function. AM
deﬁned this way is now a functional in Fµc[[]]. Conversely, let F ∈ Fµc. We denote by
H F the element of A(m) such that (α−1

M , as above. The
rationale behind this notation is explained in [BDF09] and further clariﬁed in [Rej16].
Let Aloc(m) denote the subspace of A(m) arising from local functionals.

δϕ2 E and H ≡ H m

Now we want to combine algebras corresponding to diﬀerent masses in a common

algebraic structure.

Deﬁnition 4.3. We deﬁne the following bundle of algebras

B = Gm2∈R

A(m) .

14

Let A = (Am)m2∈R be a section of B. We ﬁx M > 0 and deﬁne a function from R+

to Fµc[[]] by

m2 7→ αM (A)(m)

.
= αH(Am) ,

where H ≡ H m
M .

Deﬁnition 4.4. A section A of B is called smooth if αM (A) is smooth for some (and
hence all) M > 0. The space of smooth sections of B is denoted by A. Simlarly, Aloc
denotes the space of smooth sections of B such that A(m) ∈ Aloc(m) for all m.

A is equipped with a non-commutative product deﬁned as follows:

In Epstein-Glaser renormalization the freedom in deﬁning the renormalized S-matrix is
controlled by the Stückelberg-Petermann renormalization group.

Deﬁnition 4.5. The Stückelberg-Petermann renormalization group R is deﬁned as the
group of maps Z : Aloc → Aloc with the following properties:
Z 1. Z(0) = 0,

Z 2. Z (1)(0) = id,

Z 3. Z = id + O(),

Z 4. Z(F + G + H) = Z(F + G) + Z(G + H) − Z(G), if supp F ∩ supp G,
Z 5. δZ

δϕ = 0.

Note that constructing Z’s can be reduced to constructing maps ZH : Floc[[]] →
Floc[[]] which control the freedom in constructing Tn
H, so the abstract formalism reviewed
in the present section can be related to the more concrete description presented in sections
1-3. We have

Z = α−1

The fundamental result in the Epstein-Glaser approach to renormalization is the Main
Theorem of Renormalization ([PS82, Sto02, DF04, BDF09].

tion (17) deﬁnes a new S-matrixbS satisfying S 1– S 5.

Let us now discuss symmetries. Again, we follow closely [BDF09]. Let G be a
subgroup of the automorphism group of A. Assume that it has a well deﬁned action on
S , the space of S-matrices, by

where S ∈ S , g ∈ G. Since g ◦ S ◦ g−1 ∈ S , it follows from the Main Theorem of
Renormalization that there exists an element Z(g) ∈ R such that

S 7→ g ◦ S ◦ g−1 ,

We obtain a cocycle in R,

g ◦ S ◦ g−1 = S ◦ Z(g) .

The cocycle can be trivialized, i.e.
such that

Z(gh) = Z(g)gZ(h)g−1 .

(18)
is a coboundary, if there exists an element Z ∈ R
(19)

Z(g) = ZgZ −1g−1

∀g ∈ G .

If this is the case, then

g ◦ S ◦ g−1 = S ◦ ZgZ −1g−1 .

16

Hence

g ◦ S ◦ Z ◦ g−1 = S ◦ Z ,

so the S-matrix S ◦ Z is G-invariant.
The non-triviality of the cocycle corresponds to the existence of anomalies. One of
the most prominent examples where the cocycle cannot be trivialized is the action of the
scaling transformations.

Typically this cocycle cannot be trivialized. The generator of this cocycle, denoted by
B is related to the β-function known from the physics literature. Following [BDF09] we

The physical β-function can be obtained from B after one corrects for the “wave function
renormalization” and “mass renormalization” (see [BDF09, section 6.4] for details).

To ﬁnd B we diﬀerentiate (21) and obtain

Denote B(n)(0) ≡ B(n). The computation of B(n) amounts to summing up the scaling vi-
olations of distributional extensions appearing at order n in construction of time-ordered
products. To see that lower orders do not contribute, we use the fact that

ρ − (S ◦ Zn−1(ρ))(n)(0) ,

The proof of (25) is provided in [BDF09] and relies on the proof of the Main Theorem of
Renormalization (Theorem 4.1 in [BDF09]). We expand Z(ρ)(n)(0) in terms of Feynman
graphs:

Z(ρ)(n)(0) = XΓ∈Gn

Z(ρ)Γ .

where the sum is over all graphs with n vertices. Similarly for S(n)(0) and B(n)(0). We
can rewrite (25) as

Z(ρ)Γ = σρ ◦ TΓ ◦ σ−1

ρ − XP ∈Part′(V (Γ))

TΓP ◦OI∈P

Z(ρ)ΓI ,

(27)

where Part′(V (Γ)) denotes the set of partitions of the vertex set V (Γ), excluding the
partition with n elements; ΓP is the graph with vertex set V (ΓP ) = V (Γ), with all lines
connecting diﬀerent index sets of the partition P , and ΓI is the graph with vertex set
V (ΓI ) = I and all lines of Γ which connect two vertices in I. Diﬀerentiating (27) with
respect ot ρ gives

BΓ = ρ

Note that BΓ is an operator on F⊗n

loc [[]].

It is now clear that the second term in (27) subtracts contributions from scaling
violations corresponding to renormalization of all proper subgraphs of Γ. Hence the only
contributions to BΓ arise from scaling violations resulting from extending distributions
deﬁned everywhere outside the thin diagonal of the graph Γ.

For performing computations we need to express V ∈ A in terms of a concrete func-
tional in Floc. Let’s take V = α−1
M F for some F ∈ Floc. In the computation of B we
have to take into account that αM , does not commute with the scaling transformations.

Let F ∈ Floc. Without loss of generality we can assume F to be be monomial, i.e. of

the form

f (x)p(jx(ϕ))dDx ,

(29)

F (ϕ) =ZM

where f ∈ D and p is a monomial function on the jet space and jx(ϕ) is a ﬁnite order
jet of ϕ at point x. Graphically, we can represent F as a vertex, decorated by f with
one external leg for each factor of ϕ, some of them carrying derivatives. For example

RM f (x)ϕ4(x)dDx is

Given a monomial p on the jet space, deﬁne the set of Wick submonomials Wp as the
set of all monomials that are factors of p. For example, for ϕ4(x), the set of Wick
submonomials consists of ϕ4(x), ϕ3(x), ϕ2(x), ϕ(x), 1. It is convenient to represent p as
a graph without decoration on the vertex. For example p(jx(ϕ)) = ∂µϕ∂ν ϕ is

which can be written explicitly as

p(jx(ϕ + ψ)) = ∆(p)(jx(ϕ) ⊗ jx(ψ)) ,

∆(p) = Xq∈Wp

Sym(q) p/q ⊗ q ,

where p/q is the graph obtained by removing the edges corresponding to q and Sym(q)
is the number of ways in which graph q can be embedded into graph p. For the local

F (ϕ + ψ) =ZM

Using Sweedler’s notation:

∆p =Xp

By a small abuse of notation, we deﬁne a functional F(1)(ϕ)

Here B(n)

M (F1(1), . . . , Fn(1))(0) is a distribution, which we can write as

B(n)

M (F1(1), . . . , Fn(1))(0)(x1, . . . , xn) = f1(x1) . . . fn(xn)XΓ

where uΓ is the extention to the total diagonal of the distribution ˜uΓ constructed as in
section 3, where all the proper subgraphs have been renormalized. Hence

B(n)

M (F1, . . . , Fn)(ϕ) = XF1,...,FnXΓ (cid:10)(f1 ⊗ ··· ⊗ fn) · bΓ, F1(2), . . . , Fn(2)(cid:11) .

If Γ is EG primitive, then ˜uΓ = uΓ and uΓ scales homogeneously. In this case

bΓ = Res uΓ .

20

This result provides a link between Feynman periods discussed in section 3 and physical
quantities computed in the pAQFT framework. However, the class of distributional
residues relevant for the computation of B is larger than the ones discussed in section 3,
since here we need to replace ∆F with H F given by the formula (16). To give an idea
of how the computation proceeds at low loop orders, we review the example of ϕ4 in 4
dimensions discussed in [BDF09], but in contrast to [BDF09] we use the Feynman graphs
notation to make it easier to follow.

Example 4.7. Consider the functional

F (ϕ) = λZM

f (x)ϕ4(x)d4x .

The corresponding element of A is

V = α−1

M F ,

i.e.

V (m)M = λ α−1

f (x)ϕ4(x)d4x .

We are interested in ﬁnding BM for the QFT model with this interaction. First note
that the orbit of the renormalization group is spanned by 1 and functionals of the form

RM f1(x)ϕ4(x)d4x,RM f2(x)ϕ2(x)d4x,RM f3(x)(∂ϕ)2(x)d4x, where f1, f2, f3 ∈ D. Hence,

we need to determine BM only on such functionals. Graphically we represent them as
decorated vertices:

f1

f2

f3

Let us now compute B(2)

M on these functionals. We have

B(2)

M (cid:16) f1

f1 (cid:17) = 16DB(2)

5 Conclusion

In this overview paper we have presented the important algebraic structures appear-
ing in perturbative Algebraic Quantum Field Theory (pAQFT) on Minkowski spacetime
[BDF09]. We have seen how these relate to periods, usually investigated in a diﬀerent
context in Euclidean QFT in momentum space. The approach we advocate here provides
a natural interpretation of these periods both in the mathematical and physical context.
Mathematically, these correspond to distributional residues and are therefore intrinsic
characterization of scaling properties of certain class of distributions. Physically, they
are relevant in computing the β-function. Note that, in our approach, the later char-
acterization is independent of any regularization scheme. In fact, regularization is not
needed at all and there is no need to recur to ill deﬁned divergent expressions. Instead,
the whole analysis is centered around the singularity structure of distributions that arise
from taking powers of the Feynman propagator.

The main result of this paper is that distributional residues in pAQFT, corresponding
to CK primitive graphs, are up to a factor the same as Feynman periods in the CK
framework (as conjectured in [BDF09]). The remaining EG primitive graphs, which are
not CK primitive, also give rise to multiples of the same periods.

For the future research it would be worth investigating the distributional residues aris-
ing in pAQFT on other Lorentzian manifolds. Some interesting results have already been

22

obtained for deSitter spacetime in [Hol13]. All the fundamental structures of pAQFT
presented in this paper generalize easily to curved spacetimnes. The only diﬀerence is
the form of the Feynman propagator (or rather the “Feynman-like” propagator H F). The
hope is that looking at more general propagators one would obtain a richer structure of
residues and some new periods appearing, which are not present in the Minkowski space-
time context. It would be also interesting to investigate how these relate to motives.
