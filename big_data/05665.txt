Abstract: We study the realization of supergroup gauge theories using negative
branes in string theory. We show that negative branes are intimately connected with
the possibility of timelike compactiﬁcation and exotic spacetime signatures previously
studied by Hull. Isolated negative branes dynamically generate a change in spacetime
signature near their worldvolumes, and are related by string dualities to a smooth M-
theory geometry with closed timelike curves. Using negative D3 branes, we show that
SU (0|N ) supergroup theories are holographically dual to an exotic variant of type IIB
string theory on dS3,2 × ¯S5, for which the emergent dimensions are timelike. Using
branes, mirror symmetry and Nekrasov’s instanton calculus, all of which agree, we de-
rive the Seiberg-Witten curve for N = 2 SU (N|M ) gauge theories. Together with our
exploration of holography and string dualities for negative branes, this suggests that su-
pergroup gauge theories may be non-perturbatively well-deﬁned objects, though several
puzzles remain.

Introduction

Lie supergroups are a natural extension of Lie groups by fermionic generators. A promi-
nent example of their use in physics is to describe the symmetries of supersymmetric
quantum ﬁeld theories. In this way they are part of the global symmetries of unitary
supersymmetric theories. On the other hand, Lie groups have been used in the context
of quantum ﬁeld theories (QFTs) as gauge symmetries, leading to a successful con-
struction of the Standard Model. It is thus natural to ask what happens if one uses
a Lie supergroup as the gauge symmetry group of a QFT. If the supergroup gauge
symmetries lead to consistent QFTs, they will necessarily be non-unitary, as the gauge
ﬁelds corresponding to the fermionic generators violate the spin-statistics theorem.

A seemingly unrelated topic is the signature of spacetime. Ordinary physics hap-
pens in Lorentzian signature, but the reason for this restriction is not wholly self-
evident. Some analog of physics may be possible in Euclidean signature, or in theories
with multiple times, but these possibilities are not often studied, and raise many unan-
swered questions (for a review of two-time physics, see [1].) What would physics with
more than one time mean? What determines the signature of spacetime? Can the
signature of spacetime change dynamically? A closely related question in the context
of holography is how to generate time from a purely Euclidean theory.

Supersymmetry has been a powerful organizing principle in the context of string
theories, so it is natural to ask if supersymmetry ﬁxes the signature of spacetime. It

– 1 –

was shown in [2] that this is not the case and a diverse range of signatures are consistent
with supersymmetry and supergravity. This raises the question of whether or not non-
Lorentzian signatures should be incorporated into string theory. It turns out that the
string duality web can accommodate a number of additional theories with unusual
spacetime signature, suggesting that the full collection of these theories may form a
mathematically consistent structure, regardless of their applicability to our universe.

In this paper we show that supergroup gauge theories and dynamical change of
signature of spacetime are intimately connected. Our study was motivated by the
observation in [3] that N = 4 SU (N|M ) gauge theories, should they exist, must be
holographically dual to AdS5 × S5, since they are indistinguishable from SU (N − M )
gauge theories to all orders in 1/(N − M ) (assuming N > M ). This observation raises
the question of uniqueness of non-perturbative completions of gravity if we include
non-unitary gauge theories in our considerations.

Supergroup gauge symmetries can be realized in string theory by introducing nega-
tive branes [4, 5]. Originally introduced as ‘topological anti-branes’ and ‘ghost’ branes,
negative branes are deﬁned to be the extended objects that completely cancel the ef-
fects of ordinary branes. As a consequence, the Chan-Paton factors associated to string
endpoints sitting on negative branes have extra minus signs. Thus, SU (N|M ) gauge
symmetry can be realized by a stack of N ordinary D-branes and M negative D-branes.
Negative branes exhibit many unusual properties. The most unsettling is their neg-
ative tension, and one might be particularly interested in exploring the gravitational
backreaction of negative branes on the geometry of spacetime. A preliminary study of
this was done in [5] where it was found that negative brane solutions in supergravity
produce naked curvature singularities in spacetime.

One aim of the present paper is to study these backreactions more systematically
and uncover their physical meaning. What we ﬁnd is that negative branes are sur-
rounded by a bubble of spacetime where the metric signature has changed. In other
words we ﬁnd that negative branes induce a dynamical change of space-time signature!
In particular, we learn that the directions transverse (or parallel, depending on con-
vention) to the brane worldvolume ﬂip signature inside the bubble surrounding the
brane. Using this fact, we obtain all the supergravities with diverse signatures antic-
ipated in [2]. For example in M-theory negative M2 branes ﬂip the signature of the
eight transverse directions leading to a theory in signature (2, 9) (or (9, 2)).1 Similarly
negative M5 branes ﬂipping the signature of ﬁve transverse directions lead to a theory
in signature (5, 6) (or (6, 5)). These are precisely the signatures anticipated in [2] for

being the number of timelike dimensions.

M-theory, in addition to the usual (10, 1) (or (1, 10)).

We next use string theory to study strong coupling aspects of supergroup gauge
theories. We ﬁnd that the large N dual to N = 4 SYM for SU (N|M ) when N < M
is still AdS5 × S5 but with signature (7, 3) rather than (9, 1). In particular SU (0|M )
is of this type and is dual to supergravity with this unconventional signature. While
not a proof of the non-perturbative existence of N = 4 supergroup gauge theories, this
observation does show—at least to all orders in the 1/N expansion guaranteed to exist
for these theories—that the holographic dual should agree with the supergravity theory
in signature (3, 7) deﬁned by string perturbation theory.

We ﬁnd a consistent picture of dualities involving negative branes which ﬁts very
well with the structure found in [2], suggesting that these theories actually exist beyond
string perturbation theory. To check these statements we consider a sample of N = 2
supersymmetric gauge theories with SU (N|M ) gauge supergroup and ﬁnd their exact
non-perturbative vacuum geometry. We ﬁnd the corresponding Seiberg-Witten curve
using three diﬀerent methods: brane constructions, geometric engineering of the theory,
and direct Nekrasov calculus. We ﬁnd that all three methods agree with one another
and yield the same result. These checks lend further support to the the claim that
these theories exist non-perturbatively.

The organization of this paper is as follows. In §2, we review selected aspects of
negative branes and supergroups. In §3, we consider the gravitational backreaction of
negative branes and argue that they dynamically change the signature of the spacetime
surrounding them. In §4, we review the results in [2] involving string theories and their
respective low energy limits with diverse signatures. In §5, we study the near-horizon
limit of negative brane geometries and conjecture holographic duals for these theories.
In §6 we discuss the role of R4 curvature corrections, which in some cases make the
action complex. In §7 we discuss aspects of the worldsheet description of the various
string theories. In §8, we discuss some non-perturbative aspects of these theories and in
particular show how the non-perturbative vacuum geometry of N = 2 supersymmetric
theories based on supergroups can be solved in three diﬀerent ways, thus giving further
evidence for the existence of these theories. In §9, we end with discussion of some issues
that need to be resolved in future work.

2 Negative Branes and Supergroups

The connection between D-branes and gauge groups is one of the most important
features of string theory. On the worldsheet, D-branes appear as boundaries. Adding
an extra “Chan-Paton” label to each boundary—specifying on which brane the string
ends—is all that is required to introduce multiple D-branes. Surprisingly, although

– 3 –

the Chan-Paton label has no worldsheet dynamics, introducing N labels automatically
generates a U (N ) gauge theory in the target space, so that gauge theories emerge
naturally from string theory. The reverse is true as well: drawing Feynman diagrams
in ’t Hooft’s double line notation, the propagators and vertices form a worldsheet whose
boundaries lie on D-branes in the corresponding string theory description.

When closed strings scatter oﬀ a stack of N D-branes, each worldsheet boundary
contributes a factor of Tr 1 = N to the amplitude. While from the perspective of
closed strings in perturbation theory N could be any number, non-pertubatively the
Dirac quantization condition for D-branes requires N to be an integer. This does
not, however, exclude the possibility that N is negative. Explicitly, negative N arises
when we associate an extra minus sign to each boundary that carries one of a designated
subset of the Chan-Paton labels. These labels correspond to what we will call “negative
branes,” where boundaries without any vertex operators contribute N+ − N− to the
amplitude for N+ positive D-branes and N− negative D-branes.

What are the consequences of negative branes for gauge theory? The extra signs
imply that a string stretched between a positive brane and a negative brane has the
opposite of the usual statistics, picking up an extra minus sign in the corresponding an-
nulus diagram. This means that when positive and negative branes are brought together
anticommuting vectors (“W fermions”) become light, enhancing the U (N+) × U (N−)
gauge group to the supergroup U (N+|N−) [4, 5], i.e. the group of unitary supermatrices

(cid:18)A B

(cid:19)

U =

(2.1)

where A and B are N+ × N+ and N− × N− matrices with c-number entries and B
and C are N+ × N− and N− × N+ matrices with Grassmann number entries. The
U (N+|N−) invariant trace is Str U ≡ Tr A − Tr B, so that each hole in the ’t Hooft
diagram contributes Str 1 = N+ − N−, as in the worldsheet picture.
Some features of negative branes at ﬁrst appear parallel to anti-branes.2 For in-
stance, closed strings see only the diﬀerence N+ − N−, similar to the result of placing
N branes atop ¯N anti-branes and allowing them to annihilate. Indeed, negative branes
carry the same Ramond-Ramond (RR) charge as anti-branes, but unlike anti-branes
negative branes have negative tension. As a consequence, while branes and anti-branes
are not mutually BPS, allowing them to annihilate, positive and negative branes pre-
serve all the same supersymmetries.

Further diﬀerences appear upon closer inspection. Since the W fermions violate the
spin-statistics theorem, it follows that supergroup gauge theories are non-unitary, as

2In topological string theory, negative branes and anti-branes are equivalent, c.f. [4].

is string theory in a background containing negative branes. Moreover, these theories
contain negative energy states, most prominently the negative D-brane itself. We show
later that the true properties of negative branes are still more bizarre: each negative
brane is surrounded by a bubble where the signature of spacetime changes. Depending
on the brane, the space inside the bubble may have no time direction, or multiple time
directions, and consequently familiar physical concepts such as unitarity cease to have
any meaning.

Thus, a seemingly innocuous change to the worldsheet theory has profound conse-
quences for the target space. Given the strange and unexpected results, it is natural to
ask whether string theories with negative branes exist non-perturbatively. A simpler
question—though closely related by the AdS/CFT correspondence—is whether super-
group gauge theories themselves exist non-perturbatively. We consider the balance of
evidence brieﬂy before returning to our discussion of negative branes.

2.1 Supergroup gauge theories: Do they exist?
Consider N = 4 Super Yang-Mills with gauge supergroup U (N+|N−) realized on the
worldvolume of N+ ordinary D3-branes and N− negative D3-branes. The Lagrangian
density of this theory contains the terms

(2.2)
where the ± subscripts label the U (N±) blocks. This theory exhibits an unbounded
energy spectrum and so is non-unitary, and there is no obviously convergent expression
for the path integral. However, it is possible to deﬁne the above theory to all orders
in gs = g2
YM/4π, consistent with the fact that in string theory one can compute all
amplitudes to any order in gs. Moreover, the usual arguments for ﬁniteness of N = 4
U (N ) SYM theory still apply, suggesting that at least perturbatively, this particular
example of a supergroup gauge theory is ﬁnite. The fact that the ’t Hooft diagrams of
the U (N+|N−) theory can be obtained from those of the usual U (N ) theory by replacing
N with N+ − N− further supports this conclusion. Nevertheless, this argument does
not prove that such a theory has a consistent non-perturbative completion.3

We pause here to remark that non-unitary conformal ﬁeld theories are known to
exist in two dimensions [7–10] and there is evidence suggesting their existence in higher
dimensions [11]. It is possible that some of these conformal ﬁeld theories are IR ﬁxed

3The analogous supermatrix models can be shown to be non-trivial and consistent after gauge
ﬁxing the supergroup [6], which suggests that a path integral deﬁnition could exist if the supergroup
gauge symmetry is gauge-ﬁxed in an appropriate manner.

– 5 –

points of supergroup gauge theories; in this sense, N = 4 supersymmetry may be quite
useful in attempting to prove their existence.

Although we do not attempt an existence proof in this paper (in fact, the existence
of non-trivial unitary theories in more than two dimensions remains unproven), we
nevertheless provide evidence that these supergroup gauge theories pass the same checks
as their usual unitary counterparts. We have already argued perturbative consistency.
Later, we argue that (at least for some classes) consistent non-perturbative corrections
involving amplitudes that preserve some supersymmetry also exist. Speciﬁcally, we
obtain Seiberg-Witten curves for the N = 2 version of these theories. We also argue
that when their unitary counterparts have holographic duals, the non-unitary theories
also have holographic duals that can be used to compute amplitudes to all orders in
1/N . We will not attempt to check the non-perturbative existence of amplitudes that
completely break supersymmetry. While this has not even been done even for unitary
theories, in the unitary case lattice regularization techniques in Euclidean space provide
a working deﬁnition beyond perturbation theory, whereas this remains to be shown for
supersymmetric supergroup gauge theories.

In summary, the above arguments suggest that supersymmetric U (N+|N−) gauge
theories are perturbatively (and perhaps even nonperturbatively) well-deﬁned. The
fact that these theories are closely connected to a consistent web of dualities in string
theory reinforces the possibility of their non-perturbative existence.

We should also mention here that supergroup gauge theories have proven to be
a convenient framework to discuss exact renormalization group techniques preserving
manifest gauge symmetry [12]. In this setup the original SU (N ) Yang-Mills theory is
replaced by a theory with supergroup SU (N|N ). The model is then studied in the
phase where the supergroup is broken as

SU (N|N ) → SU (N ) × SU (N ).

The makes all the fermion gauge modes massive. The second factor essentially acts as
a Pauli-Villars regulator, without the need of gauge ﬁxing. Consequently, this method
preserves the original SU (N ) gauge symmetry. While it is true that this setup embeds
a unitary theory in a non-unitary theory, if the symmetry breaking scale is high enough,
the unphysical modes will not be excited.

3 Backreaction and Dynamical Signature Change

We return to our discussion of negative branes. The backreaction of isolated negative
branes is problematic. Since the brane tension is negative, the gravitational backreac-
tion for N− − N+ (cid:29) 1 generates a naked singularity. As this conﬁguration preserves

– 6 –

16 supercharges, the possible curvature corrections are strongly constrained — if any
are allowed at all, c.f. [13, 14] — and it is not immediately clear how to resolve this
singularity.

To see the problem, we ﬁrst review the black-brane geometry sourced by a large
number of coincident D-branes, subsequently generalizing the result to negative D-
branes. In string frame, the black D-brane geometry is of the form:4

for p (cid:54)= 3, where Ωp+1 is the volume-form along the branes, gs is the asymptotic value
of the string coupling, and

Figure 1: Negative branes are surrounded by a naked singularity at a ﬁnite distance
from the brane, forming a “bubble” around the brane.

where F = dA is the ﬁeld-strength of the world-volume gauge theory and Σ∗ is the
pullback map associated to the cycle Σ. A probe D-brane is mutually supersymmetric
with the negative Dp-brane background if the number of world-volume directions of
the probe brane parallel (n(cid:107)) and perpendicular (n⊥) to the negative brane satisfy:

n⊥ + (p + 1) − n(cid:107) = 4k ,

(k ∈ Z≥0)

(3.7)
where 4k ≥ 0 is the number of directions along which one, but not both, of the two
branes extend. Using the calibration condition (3.7), we ﬁnd the dependence of the
DBI action-density on the warp factor to be

LDBI ∝ H k−1 .

(3.8)

If k = 0 then the probe-brane is parallel to the interface, and generically does not
intersect it. Thus, for a brane crossing the interface we have k > 0, hence the action
density is ﬁnite.

Another example of this is an F-string connecting a positive brane to a nega-
tive D3 brane beyond the interface, representing a half-BPS “W fermion” on the
Coulomb branch of the supergroup. Since n(cid:107) = n⊥ = 1, the Nambu-Goto action

This suggests that supersymmetric probes can pass through the H = 0 interface,
and raises the question of what lies beyond it. To answer this question, we ﬁrst consider
the negative D0 brane solution, obtained by setting p = 0 in (3.1). The type IIA
background (3.1) lifts to an eleven-dimensional metric

This is a pp-wave background representing momentum around the M-theory circle.
As a pp-wave, all curvature invariants vanish identically. More importantly, the metric
is smooth at the H = 0 interface, allowing us to pass beyond it. For H < 0, (3.10)
describes M-theory compactiﬁed on a time-like circle, resulting in a ten-dimensional
limit with spacetime signature (10, 0), which we identify as the far side of the singular
interface discussed above, see Figure 2. The physics inside this “bubble” surrounding
the negative D0 branes is quite diﬀerent! For instance, fundamental strings arise from
M2 branes—with worldvolume signature (2, 1)—wrapping a timelike circle, hence they
are Euclidean strings, with worldvolume signature (2, 0). On the other hand, Euclidean
D2 branes are absent because they would lift to M2 branes with worldvolume signature
(3, 0), which do not occur in M-theory.

Thus, negative D0 branes are intimately connected to timelike compactiﬁcations of
M-theory.7 Since D0 branes are related to all other branes in type II string theory and
M-theory via string dualities, a similar conclusion applies to any negative brane: the
existence of negative branes is directly tied to the consistency of timelike compactiﬁca-
tion in string theory and M-theory. For each type of negative brane, the nature of the
bubble surrounding the brane will be diﬀerent. In order to derive these diﬀerences, we
will use Hull’s results on timelike compactiﬁcation of string theory [2], reviewed in §4.

3.1 Singularity crossing

Before diving into this analysis, we preview the results via a useful heuristic argument.
Neglecting any possible curvature corrections, let us take the background (3.1) near
the H = 0 interface seriously for the time being. To continue past the singularity, we
analytically continue the background as a function of H, avoiding the singularity at
H = 0. We obtain:

6As in (3.1), our conventions are self-consistent, but diﬀer slightly from the usual textbook treat-

ment in the placement of factors of gs.

7As F-strings are T-dual to a pp-wave background, negative F-strings induce a change of signature

in much the same way as negative D0 branes.

resulting in a naked singularity and a change of spacetime signature in the type IIA
description.

where ¯H ≡ −H is positive in the region beyond the interface and ω = ±i, depending
on which way we encircle H = 0 in the complex plane. While the metric at ﬁrst appears
imaginary, we can remove an overall factor using a Weyl transformation, leaving the
real metric

up to an arbitrary overall sign. A similar ﬁeld redeﬁnition can be used to remove the
complex factor in front of the dilaton proﬁle in (3.11). The resulting background is
real, but in spacetime signature (10 − p, p) instead of (9, 1). For the special case p = 0,
this is precisely the background obtained by dimensionally reducing the metric (3.10)
on the far side of the H = 0 interface, where the overall sign in (3.12) was chosen to
agree with (3.10). Moreover, the ﬁeld redeﬁnitions change some of the signs in the
supergravity action so that it matches a timelike dimensional reduction of M-theory.

This heuristic reasoning can be extended to BPS probe branes crossing the singular
interface. For instance, the W fermion considered above arises from a string with (1, 1)
worldsheet signature. After crossing the interface into signature (10− p, p) the timelike
worldsheet coordinate becomes spacelike, resulting in a worldsheet signature of (2, 0),
in agreement with the observation about Euclidean strings given previously.

M-theoryType IIAt(–y)xsingularity(9,1)(10,0)More generally, this kind of “singularity crossing” argument suggests that negative
Dp branes live in a string theory of spacetime signature (10 − p, p), within which their
worldvolume signature is (1, p). After reviewing Hull’s work, we will show that this is
indeed the case.

4 String Theory and M-Theory in Diﬀerent Signatures

The starting point of Hull’s analysis [2] is to T-dualize type IIA or type IIB string
theory on a timelike circle [15–17]. As this introduces a closed timelike curve (CTC),
one should expect the results to be exotic. Indeed, the T-dual of type IIA (IIB) string
theory on a timelike circle is not ordinary type IIB (IIA) string theory, but rather a
variant with a diﬀerent spectrum of branes.

Recall that Dp branes in ordinary string theory have worldvolume signature (p, 1).
“Euclidean branes,” with worldvolume signature (p + 1, 0) are not part of the theory.8
For instance, extremal black-brane solutions to the low-energy supergravity action have
Lorentzian worldvolume signature; extremal solutions with a Euclidean world-volume
require a diﬀerent sign for the Fp+2 kinetic term.9

However, T-dualizing type II string theory along a timelike circle removes the
timelike direction from the worldvolume of every D-brane. Thus, the T-dual contains
only Euclidean D-branes! To determine the available NS branes, recall that the T-
dual of a long string with neither momentum nor winding around the compact circle is
another long string, whereas the T-dual of an NS5 brane wrapping the compact circle
is another NS5 brane wrapping the compact circle. Consequently, these exotic string
theories appear to have Euclidean D-branes but Lorentzian F-strings and NS5 branes.
To keep track of the brane spectrum, we invent a new notation (diﬀerent from [2]).
As usual, we denote type II theories with D0, . . . , D8 branes as type IIA variants and
those with D1, . . . , D7 branes as type IIB variants. To denote the available brane
signatures, we write IIA++, IIA+−, IIA−+, etc., where the ﬁrst sign indicates whether
fundamental strings are Lorentzian (+) or Euclidean (−) and the second indicates
whether D1 / D2 branes are Lorentzian or Euclidean. Similarly, we write M+ (M−)
for the M-theory variant with Lorentzian (Euclidean) M2 branes. When we wish to

8Euclidean branes can appear as instantons after Wick-rotation, but are not present as stable
physical objects in the (9, 1) Lorentzian spacetime. However, it was suggested in [18] that Euclidean
branes (“S-branes”) can appears as unstable solutions of appropriate worldvolume theories.
9To see why the sign of |Fp+1|2 aﬀects the existence of extremal solutions, consider the ordinary
Reissner-Nordstr¨om black hole in four dimensions. The outer and inner horizons are located at r± =

M ±(cid:112)M 2 − Q2 in appropriate units. Changing the sign of |F2|2 takes Q2 → −Q2, hence r− < 0 and

there is no inner horizon and no extremal solutions.

variant in signature (9, 1) with Lorentzian strings and Euclidean D2 branes. As we will
see, this notation — summarized in Table 1 — is suﬃcient to describe all the theories
found by Hull. In particular, the signatures of the remaining branes and the low energy
eﬀective action are ﬁxed once these low-dimensional branes are speciﬁed.

To keep score in the following discussion, we refer the reader to Figures 3, 4 and
Table 2, depicting the results of Hull’s analysis in our notation. In the following dis-
cussion, we refer to IIA++
10,1) as “ordinary” string theories (M-theory).
We call the new theories introduced by Hull “exotic” string theories (M-theories) when
we wish to distinguish them from their ordinary counterparts.

It should be emphasized that there may be more than one string theory with the
spectrum of branes indicated by, e.g., IIB+−
9,1 . Diﬀerent sequences of dualities which
lead to the same brane spectrum can in principle lead to distinct string theories, and
there may be other data which is important for the non-perturbative deﬁnition of the
theory, such as discrete theta angles in gauge theory [19] or string theory [20]. Thus,
conservatively our theory labels indicate classes of string theories, which may contain
more than one member. Checking whether this occurs is an interesting direction for
future research.

Figure 3: T-dualities (solid lines) and S-dualities (dashed lines) relating type II string
theories and M-theory. In this diagram we suppress the spacetime signature for simplic-
ity (cf. Figure 4). The label x (t) indicates dualities arising from compactiﬁcation on a
spatial (timelike) circle. The left (right) diamond consists of theories with Lorentzian
(Euclidean) F-strings. Theories above and below the center line are related by exchang-
ing space and time directions, see (4.4).

we further T-dualize one of the latter on a spacelike circle then the D-branes are still
Euclidean, so it appears that IIA+−
9,1 are related by ordinary (spacelike) T-
duality. The four type II string theories related by spacelike and timelike T-duality are
depicted in the lefthand diamond of Figure 3.

9,1 and IIB+−

Next, consider the gs → ∞ limit of IIB+−

9,1 .10 As usual, S-duality will exchange
the fundamental string with the D1-brane, and the D5-brane with the NS5-brane,
leaving the D3-brane invariant. Since the F-string and NS5-brane are Lorentzian in
IIB+−
9,1 , whereas the D1, D3 and D5 are Euclidean, the new theory has Euclidean strings
and NS5-branes, Lorentzian D1 and D5-branes, and Euclidean D3-branes. Thus, it is
IIB−+
9,1 in our nomenclature. Tracking D7-branes through the S-duality requires an F-
theory description; instead, we will determine their signature once the role of further
T-dualities is understood.

Consider the T-dual of IIB−+

9,1 compactiﬁed on a spacelike circle.

If we assume
that this is dual to some theory “X” compactiﬁed on another spacelike circle, then by
wrapping a D5-brane on the compact circle we infer that X has Lorentzian D4-branes.
However, if we instead consider a D3-brane transverse to the compact circle, we would
conclude that X has Euclidean D4-branes! Both cannot be true, because reversing the

10Here we assume that the RR axion C0 = 0 for simplicity.

– 13 –

chain of T- and S-dualities would then incorrectly imply that ordinary string theory
has both Euclidean and Lorentzian D-branes.

The resolution is that IIB−+

9,1 compactiﬁed on a spacelike circle must be T-dual to
X compactiﬁed on a timelike circle. In this case, both arguments imply that X has
Lorentzian D4-branes. Wrapping a D3-brane on the compact circle, we conclude that
X has Euclidean D2-branes, hence it is IIA−−

By the same argument, consistency with T-duality will require that in IIB−+

9,1 , IIA−−
8,2
and any further T-duals, the Dp-branes alternate between Euclidean and Lorentzian as
p → p + 2. This implies, for instance, that IIB−+
9,1 has Euclidean D7-branes. Moreover,
all T-duals must share the property that the T-dual of some theory X on a spatial circle
is another theory Y on a timelike circle and vice versa, so that the spacetime signature
changes with each T-duality. This was derived in [2] from the worldsheet theory, and
is a general property of string theories with Euclidean strings.

8,2 in our nomenclature.

9,1 , we learn that IIA−−

As we venture beyond signature (9, 1), worldvolume signatures beyond Euclidean
— (p + 1, 0) — and Lorentzian — (p, 1) — become available. For instance, T-dualizing
on a spatial circle transverse to a D1-brane in IIB−+
8,2 has D2-branes
with signature (1, 2) as well as the (3, 0) Euclidean ones. More generally, we observe
that whenever a D-brane with signature (p, q) is available, so is one with (p − 2, q + 2)
and vice versa, so long as it will “ﬁt” in the spacetime signature. This is obviously
true in the (9, 1) theories, whereas it is readily seen to be preserved under T-duality
and S-duality. Because of this, we will sometimes abuse terminology and call branes
with an even-number of worldvolume times “Euclidean” and those with an odd number
“Lorentzian.” Consequently, the (1, 2) D2-brane is “Euclidean.”

Having understood T-duality for Euclidean string theories, we can now ﬁll out the
remaining string theories found by Hull. T-dualizing IIB−+
9,1 on a timelike circle, we
obtain a theory with signature (10, 0) and Euclidean D4-branes. This is IIA−+
10,0 in our
nomenclature.11 Note that this theory has no D2-branes at all, but is labeled as a theory
with Lorentzian D2-branes, since there are no Euclidean D2-branes despite ﬁtting into
the spacetime signature, whereas Lorentzian D2-branes do not ﬁt, explaining their
absence. Starting with this theory and repeatedly T-dualizing along spatial circles, we
obtain the chain of theories

(4.3)

which is the righthand diamond of Figure 3. In fact, the allowed brane signatures —
summarized in Table 2 — are periodic up to the question of which branes ﬁt inside
the spacetime signature. The periodic sequence (4.3) has length four, hence — as can
be seen in (4.2) — whenever one of these string theories exists in spacetime signature
(p, q), it also exists in signature (p+4k, q−4k). For instance, IIA−+ occurs in signatures
(10, 0), (6, 4) and (2, 8).

We now consider the S-duals of these theories, beginning with the S-duals of the
type IIB variants. Note that since IIB−+
9,1 has Euclidean NS5-branes, T-duality implies
that all IIB−+ and IIB−− theories have Euclidean NS5-branes, whereas all IIA−+ and
IIA−− theories have Lorentzian NS5-branes. Consider IIB−−
3,7 . Since the
F-string, NS5-brane, D1-brane and D5-brane are all Euclidean, S-duality maps the
spectrum of branes to itself, and we infer that these theories are self-dual. Conversely,
we already saw that IIB−+

the new theories IIB+−

that these theories are self-dual.

5,5 and IIB++

All that remains to be considered are the S-duals of the IIA variants, which will
be variants of M-theory. As usual, the S-dual of IIA++
9,1 is an eleven-dimensional theory
with Lorentzian M2 and M5-branes, where the D0-brane in IIA corresponds to the KK
mode on the M-theory circle and the D6-brane is the KK monopole in eleven dimensions
(the Taub-NUT geometry). In our nomenclature, this is M+
10,1. Consider instead the
S-dual of IIA−+
10,0. This theory has Euclidean F-strings, D0-branes and D4-branes and
no D2, D6, or NS5-branes, which is consistent with the dimensional reduction of M+
on a timelike circle.12 Because IIA++ (IIA−+) also exists in signatures (5, 5) and (1, 9)
6,5 and M+
(signatures (6, 4) and (2, 8)), we conclude that the M-theory variants M+

12Whereas the KK-mode on a spacelike circle is a particle with a timelike worldline, the KK-mode
on a timelike circle is instead a particle with a spacelike worldline, which explains why the D0-brane

should also exist as their S-duals, where now M2-branes can have signatures (2, 1) or
(0, 3) and M5-branes (5, 1), (3, 3) or (1, 5), depending on what ﬁts within the spacetime
signature.

Finally, consider the S-dual of IIA+−

9,1 . This theory has Lorentzian F-strings and
NS5-branes but Euclidean D0, D2 and D4-branes. This is consistent with the dimen-
sional reduction of an eleven-dimensional theory in signature (9, 2) on a timelike circle,
now with M2-branes of signature (3, 0) and (1, 2) and M5-branes of signature (5, 1). In
our nomenclature this is M−
8,2 , and
variants M−

9,2, where reduction on a spatial circle leads to IIA−−

1,10 are also possible by the same reasoning as above.

5,6 and M−

The complete set of S- and T-dualities are shown in Figure 3, with the explicit

spacetime signatures indicated in Figure 4.

The above classiﬁcation has a two-fold redundancy: for each string theory or M-
theory variant described above, there is a related theory obtained by exchanging the
roles of space and time, ﬂipping the spacetime and brane signatures from (p, q) to
(q, p).13
In particular, the various classes of theories are mapped to each other as

preserving the brane spectrum shown in Table 2. Following Hull, we refer to the pairs
of theories in (4.4) as “spacetime mirrors”, not to be confused with mirror symmetry
of Calabi-Yau manifolds (an unrelated phenomenon).

4.2 The low-energy limit

The type II string theory and M-theory variants considered above each correspond to
a distinct low-energy eﬀective supergravity. The supergravity eﬀective action for the
new theories can be derived from the known type IIA, type IIB, and eleven-dimensional
supergravity actions by considering the relevant T- and S-dualities in the low-energy
theory. This is done in Appendix A. For the eleven-dimensional theories we ﬁnd the
low-energy eﬀective action

since the overall signs of the Chern-Simons terms (as well as the relative signs in
the deﬁnitions of ˜Fp) are arbitrary up to redeﬁnitions of the p-form potentials and
spacetime parity reﬂection. For simplicity, we have omitted the mass term in the type
IIA variants. The action for the type IIB variants is a pseudo-action, requiring the
constraint ˜F5 = αβ (cid:63) ˜F5 in addition to the equations of motion.14
In all cases, the
low-energy eﬀective action takes the same form in all allowed signatures once the class
of theories (e.g. IIA+− or M−) is speciﬁed.15

We now comment on the relation between the spacetime mirrors of (4.4).

It is

straightforward to check that

S[M−

s,t] = −S[M +

t,s](gµν → −gµν) ,

(4.9)

so the actions are classically equivalent, but diﬀer by an overall sign. At ﬁrst, this sign
diﬀerence appears to have quantum mechanical signiﬁcance, suggesting that the loop
expansions diﬀer between the mirror theories. However, we show in §6.2 that this sign
diﬀerence is in fact required to compensate for a diﬀerence in the  prescription induced
by the signature change, gµν → −gµν, hence the loop expansions match between the
mirror theories. Analogous results apply to the IIA and IIB spacetime mirrors, except
that in the latter case a spacetime parity ﬂip is required alongside the signature ﬂip to
preserve the chirality of C4.

14The extra sign αβ in the chirality constraint is required to match the ˜F5 Bianchi identity with the

equations of motion.
15This should hold for the terms involving fermions as well, consistent with the fact that the per-
missible reality and chirality conditions on Spin(p, q) spinors only depend on (p − q) mod 8, which is
ﬁxed for theories in the same class.

Figure 5: T-duality relates negative D-branes of diﬀerent dimensions. As the radius
of the compact circle shrinks the inside of the bubble is compactiﬁed, and its T-dual
can be found from Figures 3, 4. This allows us to ﬁx the exotic string theory inside the
bubble by relating it to the negative D0-brane, whose strong coupling limit is a smooth
geometry in M-theory.

4.3 Consequences for negative branes

We now use what we have learned about string dualities with timelike compactiﬁcation
to relate all possible negative branes to dynamic signature changes, conﬁrming the
heuristic arguments of §3. The reasoning is very simple. As we have already established,
the negative D0-brane is related to a smooth pp-wave geometry in M-theory, in which
the signature of the compact circle changes dynamically from spacelike to timelike.
By applying further T- and S-dualities to both sides of the interface, we can generate
the dynamical signature changes associated to other types of negative branes (which
transform in the same way as the associated positive branes and T- and S-dualities).

10,0 to IIB−+

For instance, compactifying one of the spatial directions transverse to the nega-
tive D0-brane and T-dualizing, we obtain a negative D1-brane. Applying the same
transformation to the backreacted geometry, we ﬁnd that the T-duality transforms the
inside of the bubble from IIA−+
9,1 , as illustrated in Figure 5. Proceeding in the
same fashion, we can derive the dynamical signature changes associated to all types
of negative Dp-branes. For instance, we ﬁnd that a negative D5-brane induces a dy-
namical signature change to IIB−+
5,5 . Applying S-duality, we conclude that a negative
B-type NS5-brane induces a change to IIB+−
5,5 . T-dualizing one of the spatial direc-
tions on the NS5 worldvolume, we ﬁnd that an A-type NS5-brane induces a change to
IIA++
5,5 .16 Similar arguments allow us to ﬁx the dynamical signature change associated
to all possible types of negative branes, as summarized in Table 3.

These results are consistent with the heuristic “singularity crossing” argument in-
troduced in §3. For instance, notice that the inside of the bubble has signature (D−p, p)

16Because the worldvolume directions ﬂip signature upon crossing the interface, this is a timelike

T-duality inside the bubble.

living inside the bubble, we place BPS probe branes across the interface and read oﬀ
their signatures on the far side. For instance, consider a negative Dp-brane and a probe
Dq-brane sharing r + 1 spacetime directions with the negative brane and perpendicular
to it in the others. The probe brane is BPS if p + q − 2r ≡ 0 (mod 4), whereas the
signature of the brane within the bubble is (q − r + 1, r). Applying this formula to D1
and D2-branes, we conclude that the string theory inside the bubble is either18

depending on whether p is even or odd, where we use the fact that strings inside the
bubble are Euclidean, as observed in §3. This is consistent with Table 3, where the
signatures of the remaining BPS D-branes can be determined analogously.

Another way to identify the correct string theory is to apply the ﬁeld redeﬁnitions
mandated by the singularity crossing to the low energy eﬀective action. For a negative
Dp-brane (cf. (3.1)), the metric and dilaton pick up factors

gµν → ωgµν ,

17A TN-brane has codimension four, and counts as a ﬁvebrane in type II string theory and a sixbrane

in M-theory.
18Assume the equivalence of spacetime mirror theories, we can apply (4.4) to re-express the resulting
string theory in the ﬂipped signature (p, 10−p), so that the directions transverse (rather than parallel)
to the brane ﬂip signature at the interface. The two descriptions are physically equivalent.

– 20 –

µ is the vielbein and det ea

branch cut. Here we replace (cid:112)| det g| = det ea

on crossing the singularity, where ω = ±i depending on which way we go around the
µ to avoid branch cuts in the action,
µ picks up a factor of ω (ω−1) for each direction which
where ea
is transverse (parallel) to the brane. Applying this to the eﬀective action for type II
string theory and comparing with the results of §4.2 we reproduce (4.10), irrespective of
the choice of branch cut. Similar reasoning can be used to reproduce the rest of Table 3
using singularity crossing arguments. We leave this as an exercise for the interested
reader.

Thus, accounting for backreaction, we conclude that negative branes are surrounded
by a bubble containing an exotic string theory whose spacetime signature is in general
not Lorentzian. Remarkably, although we began with a negative tension object, within
this bubble the “negative brane” appears to have positive tension. To see this, consider
the negative D0-brane, for which the warp factor is

inside the IIA−+

but there cannot be more than one object corresponding to the same geometry. Since (4.12)

clude that both correspond to the same object placed in diﬀerent backgrounds, IIA++
9,1
and IIA−+

All that remains to be established is that a D0-brane in IIA−+

10,0 has positive tension,
in some appropriate sense. We take the ADM deﬁnition of tension, which is positive
because the second summand in (4.13) is positive.

This is suggests a possible resolution to the mysterious role of negative branes in
ordinary string theories. Although they appear as exotic, negative tension objects in
these theories, they are more naturally viewed as positive tension branes in an exotic
string theory (see Figure 6), where the presence of the negative brane in ordinary string
theory dynamically induces a change of signature to the exotic string theory.

– 21 –

4.4 Signature-changing domain walls

This dynamic change of signature can occur even without the presence of negative
branes. Consider the eleven-dimensional metric

Applying T- and S-dualities to both sides of the interface, we obtain a wide variety
of signature-changing domain walls in both string theory and M-theory. As in the
above example, each domain wall is characterized by the ﬂux supporting it, of the form
Fp+1 ∝ dx ∧ Ωp, where the directions spanned by Ωp reverse signature at the singular
interface and the remaining directions are unaﬀected. The Taub-NUT geometry occurs
as a special case, where

All the possible domain walls connecting two M-theories are pictured in Figure 7,
classiﬁed by the pair of theories they connect and the type of ﬂux supporting them.
There are numerous examples connecting two string theories, as summarized in Fig-
ures 8, 9. In some cases, these correspond to the signature changes induced by negative
branes in ordinary string theory, cf. Table 3. In other cases, the domain walls connect
two exotic string theories.

19A necessary and suﬃcient condition to avoid ﬁxed points is that Λ has a unit eigenvector λΛ = λ
such that λ · a (cid:54)= 0. Using this observation, one can show that (4.19) is one of only three families of
orientation preserving smooth Poincare quotients of R2,1, with λ ∝ dy null. The other two have space-
like (timelike) λ and can be written as a boost (rotation) followed by a translation in the orthogonal
direction. There are no non-trivial (Λ (cid:54)= 1) examples for D < 3.

5 AdS/CFT For Negative Branes

In the next few sections, we discuss various consistency checks of our proposed link
between negative branes and signature change, as well as consistency checks of Hull’s
exotic string theories themselves.

Our ﬁrst topic is the AdS/CFT correspondence for negative branes. On the gauge
theory side, the large N planar loop expansion is convergent, rather than asymptotic,
implying that the large N behavior of supergroup gauge theories can be understood

without needing to address the non-perturbative subtleties discussed in §2.1. In par-
ticular, the N = 4 theories with gauge groups U (N|0) and U (0|N ) are related by
λ → −λ for N ﬁxed, with λ ≡ g2
YMN . Since planar quantities are analytic near λ = 0,
the supergravity limit λ (cid:29) 1 can be reached by analytic continuation, allowing for
non-trivial comparisons with the AdS dual. The only diﬀerence is that (relative to the
normal case) we are interested in λ → −∞ instead of λ → ∞.

To ﬁnd the holographic dual of the U (0|N ) N = 4 theory, we consider the backre-

action of N negative D3-branes. This generates the background

As argued in §4.3, this describes a bubble of the exotic string theory IIB−−
7,3 surrounding
the negative D3-brane. The D3-brane horizon at r = 0 lies within this bubble, and the
near horizon region r (cid:28) L ≡ λ1/4α(cid:48)1/2 is therefore described by this string theory in

To identify the remaining metric factor in (5.3), we brieﬂy review maximally sym-

known as the Poincare patch, where u = L2/r. Comparing with (5.3), we conclude that
the near horizon geometry of negative D3-branes is AdS2,3 × S5, depicted in Figure 10.
The bosonic symmetry group SO(2, 4)× SO(6) ∼= SO(4, 2)× SO(6) is unchanged, and
matches the bosonic part of the N = 4 superconformal group as expected. Thus, we
are led to conjecture that the N = 4 U (0|N ) theory is holographically dual to IIB−−
string theory on AdS2,3 × S5.
20For simplicity we ignore the global properties of these hypersurfaces, such as the distinction

7,3

between them and their universal covers.

– 26 –

Figure 10: The near horizon geometry of negative branes lies within the bubble of
exotic string theory surrounding the brane.

A mildly annoying feature of this proposed duality is that the boundary of AdS2,3
has signature (1, 3). We can remedy this moving to the spacetime mirror descrip-
3,7 compactiﬁed on dS3,2 × ¯S5, where ¯S5
tion, (4.4),21 for which the dual theory is IIB−−
denotes a timelike ﬁve-sphere. The two descriptions are physically equivalent, but from
the CFT perspective the latter is more natural. In this case, the emergent ﬁfth dimen-
sion is timelike, and the proposed duality should perhaps be thought of as “dS/CFT”,
albeit unrelated to dS4,1.

A classic test of the AdS/CFT correspondence for U (N ) is the agreement between
the dimensions of chiral primary operators in the gauge theory and the masses of
supergravity modes in AdS5 [22], which are related by
(∆ − 2)2 = m2L2 + 4 ,

(5.9)

for scalar operators, with similar expressions for other spins. Scalar chiral primary
operators are operators of the form Tr[φ(i1 . . . φin)] with all SO(6) traces removed,
where φi denotes one of the six adjoint scalars of U (N ) transforming in the vector
representation of the SO(6) R-symmetry. These can be matched to the harmonics of
the supergravity ﬁelds on S5 [23].

The same spectrum of chiral primary operators exists in the U (0|N ) theory, which
3,7 on dS3,2 × ¯S5 according to our con-
should match the mode decomposition of IIB−−
jecture. In fact, the computation is almost trivially the same, because the two super-
gravities are related by an analytic continuation of the background by L2 → ±iL2,
21We assume for the remainder of this section that the spacetime mirrors are exactly equivalent.

All our our subsequent results still follow if this is not the case, but the notation would diﬀer.

Similar considerations apply to other observables which are independent of λ = L4/α(cid:48)2.
To obtain nontrivial tests of our conjectural holographic duality we consider λ-
dependent observables in both the U (0|N ) gauge theory and in IIB−−
3,7 string theory,
where the latter arise from α(cid:48) corrections to the supergravity action. On the gauge
theory side, these observables can be computed by analytically continuing λ → −λ.
By (5.8), each factor of the metric g contributes an L2 = α(cid:48)√
λ, so that λ → −λ
corresponds to g → ±ig, which is the singularity crossing prescription of §4.3, (4.11)!
So far, we have not shown how to compute α(cid:48) corrections in exotic string theories
such as IIB−−
3,7 . As we have just shown, the AdS/CFT correspondence predicts that, at
3,7 (equivalently IIB−−
least for IIB−−
7,3 ), these corrections are related to those for IIB++
9,1
by the singularity crossing prescription. To test this prediction, we will compute the
3,7 low-energy eﬀective action, ﬁrst in §6 via a chain of S-
α(cid:48)3R4 corrections to the IIB−−
10,1) and then in §7 by
and T-dualities relating them to those of ordinary M-theory (M+
worldsheet methods.

Before proceeding with the calculation we encounter an immediate puzzle, since

the prescription g → ±ig takes

(R + α(cid:48)3R4) → (R ± iα(cid:48)3R4)

(5.10)

up to an overall phase that cancels against the volume integration measure. Thus (un-
like at the two-derivative level) the singularity crossing prescription introduces imag-
inary terms into the action, which moreover have signs which depend on the choice
of branch in continuing around the H = 0 singularity. This is surprising because the
U (N ) planar loop expansion is analytic in λ, hence λ → −λ produces a real result for
planar observables in the U (0|N ) theory.

This apparent inconsistency is resolved by the fact that the planar loop expansion
has a ﬁnite radius of convergence beyond which branch cuts and other singularities can
appear [24, 25]. For instance, the spectrum of string excitations in the plane wave limit
of AdS5 × S5 describe a set of operators with twists [26]

continuing λ → −∞, we obtain opposite imaginary results for ∆ − J, depending on
which way we go around the branch cut, as depicted in Figure 11. Similar factors of i
inducing a sign-change in the gauge coupling have been anticipated in the context of

The dotted circle |λ| < λ0 denotes the radius of convergence of the loop expansion in

string theory on AdS4,1 × S5 according to the ordinary AdS/CFT correspondence at
the planar level. Analytically continuing λ → −∞ we encounter a branch cut starting
at (or outside) the radius of convergence. Depending on which way we go around the
branch cut, we obtain an ambiguous answer of the form ∆1 ± i∆2, corresponding to
the sign ambiguity in α(cid:48) corrections to IIB−−

analytically-continuation from AdS to dS spacetimes, for which it has been suggested
the corresponding gauge theory is nonunitary; see [27].

More generally, the appearance of half-integer powers of λ in the λ (cid:29) 1 super-
gravity expansion indicates the presence of such a branch cut in generic λ-dependent
observables, and the ambiguity in the supergravity eﬀective action corresponds to the
ambiguity in going around the branch cut on the negative λ axis.

5.1 Other holographic duals
Besides the conjectural duality between the N = 4 U (0|N ) negative brane gauge theory
3,7 on AdS2,3 × S5, there are several other holographic dualities predicted by
and IIB−−
our work, most notably between the worldvolume theory on negative M2-branes and
2,9 on AdS2,2 × S7 and between the worldvolume theory on negative M5-branes and
M+
5,6 on AdS2,5 × S4. The latter two examples do not have exactly marginal couplings,
M−
hence the only expansion parameter is N . In principle, the negative brane theories are
related to their ordinary cousins by analytically continuing N → −N , and a similar

of a weak coupling limit for the dual CFT.22 We leave any further discussion of these
prospective holographic dualities for a future work.

In principle, we can derive holographic duals of the worldvolume theories on D3-
branes, M2-branes, or M5-branes in any of the exotic string/M-theories considered
above by taking the near horizon limit of their large N backreacted geometries. How-
ever, additional diﬃculties arise in cases other than those considered above, because
the “horizon” Sd becomes a non-compact space (A)dSs,t, making it unclear whether
standard arguments apply or how to interpret the result if they do. This, too, is left
for future work.

6 Curvature Corrections
In this section, we analyze the R4 corrections in exotic string theories by relating them
to one loop corrections in the low energy eﬀective supergravity description. The results
of this section will be used to conﬁrm the predictions of AdS/CFT derived in §5, and
will be cross checked against explicit worldsheet calculations in §7.
6.1 R4 corrections from KK loops
There are two R4 corrections to the eﬀective action of type IIA string theory, of the
schematic form:

(6.1)

SR4 ∼ α(cid:48)3

appearing at tree level and one loop in the string loop expansion, respectively. Here we
suppress the overall coeﬃcient and index structure for simplicity, as this is not essential
to our analysis (see, e.g., [29] for the details). Lifting to M -theory, we obtain (A.4, A.5)

R ∼ e− 2

3 ΦR(11) ,

In the M-theory lift, the Einstein-Hilbert term(cid:112)|g|e−2ΦR and the one-loop correction
(cid:112)|g|R4 are independent of R11 ∼ e2Φ/3, but the tree-level correction(cid:112)|g|e−2ΦR4 scales

11 and vanishes as we take the eleven-dimensional limit, R11 → ∞. Thus, the

22For negative M2-branes we can introduce a second parameter by placing the M2-branes at a C4/Zk
singularity (breaking some of the supersymmetry), where k corresponds to the Chern-Simons level in
the dual ABJM theory [28], which is perturbative for k (cid:29) N . An analysis of this conﬁguration and
its dual is beyond the scope of the present work.

– 30 –

due to the one-loop correction of type IIA string theory, but no trace of the tree-level
correction remains in the eleven-dimensional theory.

The reason for this discrepancy is that the “tree-level” correction in type IIA string
theory is generated by one loop diagrams involving KK modes in the eleven dimensional
eﬀective supergravity description [30], whereas the “one-loop” correction corresponds
to the tree-level coupling (6.3) in eleven dimensions.

This means that the string tree-level R4 correction of type IIA string theory can
be obtained by a one-loop computation in eleven-dimensional supergravity. The string
one-loop correction can also be obtained by one-loop supergravity calculation when we
consider the T-duality between type IIA and type IIB string theory.
In particular,
compactifying type IIA and type IIB string theory on a circle leads to the same nine-
dimensional theory, whose two-derivative low-energy eﬀective action is (A.11). The
radion σ and dilaton Φ in nine-dimensions are related to the ten-dimensional dilaton

The R4 corrections (6.1) reduce to

An analogous set of corrections exist in type IIB string theory. These reduce to

23The relation between the computations can be established by considering M-theory compactiﬁed
on a torus. Exchanging which cycles we label as the M-theory and IIA circles exchanges the two
computations.

in addition to an inﬁnite set corrections which are non-perturbative in gs, and which
we ignore in the present analysis.24
Thus, all the R4 corrections in string/M-theory can be thought of as eﬀective
couplings generated a loop of KK modes in some dual description. We now exploit
this fact to compute the R4 corrections in the exotic string/M-theories considered
previously. To do so, we ﬁrst consider how the spacetime signature and the diﬀerence
between spacelike and timelike compactiﬁcation aﬀect these corrections.

6.2 Feynman rules and spacetime mirrors

We now derive the Feynman rules for the eﬀective supergravity theories described
in §4.2. To avoid any possible ambiguities, we do so by relating the quantized eﬀective
theories to each other and to the ordinary supergravities IIA++
10,1 via
spacelike and timelike compactiﬁcation in the language of Feynman diagrams.

9,1 and M+

9,1 , IIB++

Since the vertices are local, the physics of compactiﬁcation is encoded in the prop-

agator. Before compactifying, we have the Feynman propagator25

,

(6.8)

for a scalar ﬁeld in D dimensions. Compactifying on a spatial circle, xµ ∼= xµ + 2πRµ
for spacelike Rµ, the Green’s function becomes a sum over images

The inﬁnite sum on n can be evaluated using Poisson resummation, (cid:80)∞

24These additional corrections are also present in type IIB but not in type IIA. In the type IIA
description, they are generated by the KK modes of the D0 brane and its marginal bound states. In
the eleven-dimensional description, they are generated by the lattice of KK modes on T 2.

25We follow the conventions of [31], converting to a mostly-plus metric signature.

enforces conservation of KK number. The Feynman rules of the d-dimensional theory
are otherwise the same as those of the D-dimensional theory.26

The case where Rµ is timelike is closely analogous. We ﬁx Rµ = (T, 0, . . .) with a

Lorentz transformation, which gives

(6.11)

Thus, the Feynman rules are the same as for spacelike compactiﬁcation, except that
the metric signature is (+ . . . +) instead of (− + . . . +) and the masses of the KK modes
are M 2 = m2 − k2/R2.

Comparing the various supergravities via S and T-dualities, we conclude that all

of them have Feynman rules which follow from a path integral of the standard form

(cid:90)

Z =

[Dφ]eiS[φ] ,

(6.12)

with the epsilon prescription p2 + m2 − i for the propagators, where now p2 involves
the signature (s, t) metric. While this is the expected result, it is important to establish
deﬁnitively, as our subsequent conclusions will follow from it.

As a preliminary exercise, we verify the equivalence of the spacetime mirror the-
ories (4.4) at the quantum level in eﬀective ﬁeld theory. Mapping g → −g (reversing
the metric signature) has two eﬀects on the quantum theory:

1. The Feynman rules are mapped onto those of the parity-reversed spacetime mir-
ror, with an extra minus sign for each vertex and propagator, see (4.9) and fol-
lowing discussion.

2. The epsilon prescription is reversed ( → −).

Combining these two eﬀects, we see that

M(p, j, Q; in)g→−g = −M(˜p, ˜j, Q; out)∗ ,

(6.13)
where M denotes any scattering amplitude, M the same scattering amplitude in
the spacetime mirror, p, j, and Q the momenta, spins, and charges of the external
particles—considered to be incoming on one side of the equation and outgoing on the
other—and ˜p, ˜j the parity reversed momenta and spins. Thus, the scattering ampli-
tudes for the spacetime mirror theories are related by T (up to a physically insigniﬁcant

overall minus sign),27 and the two eﬀective theories are physically equivalent. Notice
that the minus sign in (4.9) is crucial to the success of (6.13). Without this, the two
theories would be inequivalent!

6.3 KK loop diagrams

(cid:90)

We now consider the eﬀect of one loop diagrams involving KK modes, which will
generate eﬀective couplings for the KK zero modes in d = D − 1 dimensions. Denote
the signature of the D-dimensional theory as (s, t). The amplitude contains an integral
of the form

(cid:105)n ,
in the spacelike case, where we introduce Feynman parameters ui ≥ 0 with(cid:80)

i<j uiuj(pi − pj)2 +(cid:80)

i ui = 1,
and pi are related to the external momenta. In the low-energy limit |(cid:126)pi|, mi (cid:28) 1/R,
the ui-dependent terms can be neglected, and we obtain

after Wick rotating (cid:96)ˆµ → i(cid:96)ˆµ for ˆµ timelike, as dictated by Re  > 0. By contrast, a
tree-level eﬀective coupling contributes iM ∼ iλeﬀ, so that

λeﬀ ∼ it−1 ,

(6.16)

up to an overall sign. In particular, for t = 1 the eﬀective couplings are real, as expected
from unitary ﬁeld theory, but for t (cid:54)= 1 this no longer holds in general.

Similar reasoning applies to the case of time-like compactiﬁcation, except that the
denominator is of the form (cid:126)(cid:96)2−k2/T 2−i, so we Wick rotate (cid:96)ˆµ → −i(cid:96)ˆµ for ˆµ spacelike,

and the eﬀective coupling takes the form

so the result can be real or imaginary, depending on the spacetime signature.

27For theories with multiple times, we deﬁne T as the antilinear operator which exchanges in and
out states combined with a spacetime parity ﬂip, where spatial and temporal parity ﬂips are equivalent
for s, t > 1.

Using (6.16), (6.18), we can ﬁx the phase of the R4 corrections in all of the exotic

string/M-theories by relating them to KK loop calculations. We ﬁnd

for α = ±1, where we have not attempted to compute the overall sign, coeﬃcient, or
index structure for each term. For each correction, there are multiple ways to relate
it to a KK loop along the lines of §6.1, all of which give the same phase. Notice in
particular that spacetime mirrors have R4 corrections with the same phases, and that
these phases agree with the singularity crossing prescription of §4.3, (4.11), and with
the AdS/CFT analysis of §5.

In type IIB theories there are additional corrections which are non-perturbative in

the string loop expansion. These are discussed brieﬂy in §9.4.

7 Worldsheet Theories
In the previous section, we quantized the low energy eﬀective theories described in §4.2
and used them to learn something about R4 corrections. In this section, we will try to
understand the full UV behavior of these theories. We will work under the assumption
that the exotic IIA/B theories have a worldsheet description, much like ordinary type
IIA/B string theory.

A novel feature which occurs in some of these theories is that the fundamental
strings have Euclidean signature. To better understand the consequences of this, we
will study bosonic string theory with a Euclidean worldsheet. This should share some
features with the putative worldsheet theories for the exotic IIA/B−± theories. We
leave a construction of the full superstring in these exotic theories for future work.28

28Note that there is no guarantee that the exotic string theories admit a worldsheet description—
even if they exist as mathematically consistent spacetime theories with stringlike excitations. However,
the results of this section suggest that a worldsheet description is possible.

– 35 –

where the worldsheet metric γab has signature (ε, 1) with ε = +1 (ε = −1) for a
Euclidean (Lorentzian) worldsheet, and the overall sign is chosen so that (∂τ X)2 has a
positive coeﬃcient.

We proceed to solve the classical theory for the closed string in the usual fashion,
keeping the parameter ε generic throughout the calculation. Gauge-ﬁxing to a ﬂat
worldsheet metric γτ τ = ε, γσσ = 1, γτ σ = 0 and introducing left and right-moving

coordinates σ± = τ ± √−εσ, the X µ equations of motion have the general solution

reality conditions because the Wick rotated time coordinate is imaginary τ∗

implying that complex conjugation exchanges left and right movers.

7.2 The quantized Euclidean string

We now compute the spectrum of the quantized Euclidean string. Surprisingly, all the
massive states will turn out to have imaginary m2. We later show that this novel feature
is in fact required for the consistency of the theory when toroidally compactiﬁed.

The quantum dynamics associated to the Euclidean worldsheet theory is formally

encoded in the path integral over Euclidean worldsheets,

(cid:90)

Z =

[Dγ][DX] eiS .

(7.6)

The Lorentzian worldsheet theory can also be written as a Euclidean path integral, but
now of the form:

Z =

[Dγ][DX] e−SE .

(7.7)

(cid:90)

The crucial diﬀerence between (7.6) and (7.7) is that the former is oscillatory, whereas
the latter is damped. Thus, although both variants admit a Euclidean path integral
description, they are physically distinct. The eﬀect of these diﬀerences will soon become
apparent.

To canonically quantize the theory, we introduce the equal-time commutator
[X µ(σ, τ ), Πν(σ(cid:48), τ )] = iηµνδ(σ − σ(cid:48)) ,

any further discussion of these issues.

can be interpreted as the quantized momentum on a T-dual circle of radius R(cid:48) = α(cid:48)/R
and signature (ηDD)(cid:48) = −εηDD. In particular, for a Euclidean worldsheet ε = +1, the
T-dual circle has opposite signature! This matches the D-brane based results of §4.1
and the eﬀective supergravity analysis of Appendix A.

Note that (7.14), (7.15) contain an interesting interplay between the zero modes
and oscillators. The change of signature during T-duality for ε = +1 arises because
of the relative ±i between the momentum and winding contributions to pL,R, but this
creates an imaginary level mismatch which must be cancelled by the oscillators. Thus,
the imaginary oscillator spectrum is a necessary consequence of the change of spacetime
signature during T-duality.

(N, ˜N ) = (2, 0) or (0, 2) depending on the relative sign of n and w. The spectrum for
(N, ˜N ) = (2, 0) consists of two scalars, a vector, and a symmetric tensor from αM−1αN−1|0(cid:105)
and a further scalar and vector from αM−2|0(cid:105). Due to the appearance of additional
massless symmetric tensors (gravitons) charged under momentum and winding, we
conclude that the physics at this radius must be quite exotic!

7.4 Modular invariance

A thorough treatment of string interactions in the Euclidean worldsheet theory is be-
yond the scope of this paper. It is relatively straightforward, however, to verify the
modular invariance of the one loop zero-point amplitude.30 The torus partition function

whereas the time translation is imaginary (real) for the Lorentzian (Euclidean) world-

contribute qN ¯q ˜N , independent of the signature, and the partition function for a non-
compact boson X µ is virtually unchanged:

ZX(τ, ¯τ ) ≡ Z/V = (−ε)−1/4(4π2α(cid:48)τ2)−1/2|η(τ )|−2 ,

(7.22)

where the phase for ε = +1 comes from the oscillatory integral over zero modes and
V is the target space volume. Modular invariance of the one-loop amplitude follows in
close analogy with the Lorentzian case.

Polyakov action (7.1) by replacing ηµν → gµν(X) and adding a B-ﬁeld and dilaton in
the usual way. For the dilaton term we including an extra phase βε (with β−1 = 1),
which will turn out to be necessary.32

In principle, by requiring the beta functions of this sigma model to vanish we can
compute the low energy eﬀective action in a derivative expansion. Instead, we relate
the Euclidean (ε = +1) and Lorentzian (ε = −1) sigma models to each other and use
known results for the latter. In the Lorentzian case, we ﬁrst Wick rotate to obtain the

an analytic continuation of the couplings.

operators on the worldsheet. By a calculation in [32], for the ordinary bosonic string
φ ∝ ηµνsµν in light-cone gauge, i.e., the dilaton arises from the trace part of the graviton
vertex operator. Making the replacements ηµν → −iηµν, sµν → −isµν, φ → iβ1φ
according to (7.28), we obtain iβ1φ ∝ ηµνsµν for the Euclidean worldsheet theory.
Since the dilaton remains the trace part of the graviton, we must have iβ1 = 1 up to a
conventional sign, so that βε = 1/

Using the above results, we can ﬁx the two-derivative eﬀective action of the bosonic

for ε = ±1. Here we apply the analytic continuation (7.28) to the known result for
ε = −1. Apart from the diﬀerent critical dimension of the bosonic string, this agrees
precisely with the NSNS part of the superstring result (4.7), which we derived by
duality arguments. Moreover, the analytic continuation (7.28) is essentially the sin-
gularity crossing prescription (4.11). The only diﬀerence is the signature-dependent
phase acquired by e−2Φ in (4.11), but in the absence of RR ﬁelds this only aﬀects loop
calculations, which we have not addressed.

In particular, (7.28) is suﬃcient to reproduce the i prefactor of the e−2ΦR4 curva-
ture correction for Euclidean worldsheets that we found in (6.19). Heuristically, since
derivative corrections introduce new propagating degrees of freedom, the imaginary R4
correction can be thought of as a consequence of the imaginary spectrum of massive
string modes for the Euclidean theory.

A more detailed development of the worldsheet description of the exotic string
theories considered in our work would likely provide further insight into their properties,
but we leave this for a future work.

8 Non-Perturbative Dynamics of Supergroup Gauge Theories

For much of this paper, we have focused on isolated negative branes. In this section, we
consider supergroup gauge theories, arising from positive and negative branes together.
We present evidence that these gauge theories exist non-perturbatively.
8.1 The diﬀerence between U (N|M ) and U (N − M )
We begin by commenting on a subtle issue associated with supergroup gauge theo-
ries. A long-standing observation about these theories is that U (N|M ) closely mimics
U (N −M ) [5, 33, 34]. Consider for example gauge-invariant correlation functions in the
N = 4 theory discussed above. Using the ’t Hooft double line notation for Feynman
diagrams, N and M only appear in the combination Str 1 = N − M , so that U (N|M )
is perturbatively equivalent to U (N − M )!

The partition function of the N = 4 U (N ) theory on S4 is given by that of a
Gaussian matrix model [35]. By a supersymmetric localization argument the same
should apply to supergroup gauge theories, and we can learn something about their
non-perturbative physics by studying Gaussian supermatrix models. Recently it was
observed that, despite earlier claims to the contrary [34], the U (N|M ) supermatrix
model is not equivalent to the U (N − M ) matrix model [3], as there are gauge invariant
operators whose expectation value is zero in the latter but non-zero in the former.
It turns out that even the exact partition functions of the two theories are not the
same: The diﬀerences appear to arise from subtleties associated to fermionic gauge
symmetries [6], which are best resolved by gauge-ﬁxing.

This suggests that U (N|M ) and U (N − M ) are inequivalent theories, distinguished
at least by their behavior on S4, and likely in other ways as well.
If so, this has
interesting consequences for negative branes in string theory. For instance, it implies
that an equal number of superposed positive and negative branes is not equivalent to
the string vacuum, contrary to [5]. Nonetheless, this conﬁguration looks identical to
the vacuum from the perspective of closed strings in perturbation theory, and it is
not immediately clear what distinguishes it non-perturbatively. One possibility is that
the supermatrix model only sees a diﬀerence because it describes a brane wrapping
a compact cycle, for which the Coulomb branch is integrated over, as opposed to a
brane with a non-compact worldvolume, for which the Coulomb branch parameterizes
diﬀerent superselection sectors. However, this cannot be the full answer, because the
set of operators in the U (N|M ) theory is strictly bigger than the set of operators in
the U (N − M ) theory.

8.2 Negative D-brane intersections and negative matter

As is well known, the boundary of a brane can live on the worldvolume of another
brane. Given the above discussion, we anticipate that this kind of conﬁguration can
also be realized with negative branes. For example, consider N D4 branes ending on
a pair of parallel NS5-branes—this should give rise to N = 2 SU (N ) Yang-Mills in
four dimensions. Now instead, imagine a collection of N ordinary D4-branes and M
negative D4-branes. Since N = 2 SYM makes sense, this construction should be able
to accommodate negative branes.
In particular, suspending N ordinary D4 and M
negative D4-branes between two NS5-branes should produce a SU (N|M ) gauge theory
with N = 2 supersymmetry. As far as the mechanism of branes ending on branes
is concerned, the only diﬀerence between a positive brane and a negative brane is
that the respective charges they induce on the boundary are opposite; the amount of
supersymmetry they preserve is the same.

The above example also illustrates the type of matter these theories can have.
Consider N D4-branes suspended between a pair of parallel NS5-branes, and add one
D4-brane ending on the other side of one of the NS5-branes. This gives rise to a
theory with one fundamental SU (N ) matter. In terms of geometric engineering, this
conﬁguration can be viewed as the result of breaking a supersymmetric SU (N + 1)
theory to an SU (N ) × U (1) theory with some of the matter of the former theory
appearing as matter content in the latter theory. Now we might ask what happens
if we replace the D4-brane on the other side of the NS5-brane with a negative D4
brane? Similarly, this kind of conﬁguration can be viewed as the result of breaking of
a SU (N|1) theory to a SU (N ) × U (0|1) theory, where the extra matter is now in the
fundamental representation of SU (N ) with opposite statistics. We call this “fermionic”
or “negative” fundamental matter.
8.3 N = 2 supergroup theories
As discussed in §2, in order to provide evidence for the non-perturbative existence of
gauge theories with supergroup symmetry, it would be useful to perform some exact
non-perturbative computations in these theories.
It turns out to be possible to do
computations similar to those done in usual case of ordinary Lie groups. In this section
we explain how such computations can be carried for N = 2 supersymmetric theories
with gauge supergroup SU (N|M ).

First of all we have to note that the negative of the beta function for an N = 2
SU (N ) theory is proportional to N , which implies that in the supergroup case the
negative of the beta function is proportional to N − M .
If N > M we have an
asymptotically free theory; if N = M we should get a conformal theory; and if N < M

the theory is not UV complete. We will study the Seiberg-Witten (SW) curve for this
theory, which will depend on N + M − 1 parameters. In fact, as we will explain shortly,
we learn that the SW curve in this case is the same as that of an ordinary SU (N ) gauge
theory with 2M fundamental matters, where the masses of the 2M ﬂavors are pairwise
equal. Such a theory has (N − 1) Coulomb and M mass parameters, also leading to a
total of N + M − 1 parameters. In this context, we ﬁnd that the Seiberg-Witten curve
has genus N − 1, suggesting that the coupling constants for the SU (M ) part do not
get corrected. Moreover, the Coulomb branch parameters of the SU (M ) part behave
as if they are the mass parameters of the SU (N ) theory.

Recall that for an ordinary SU (N ) theory, the Seibeg-Witten curve is given by

z + det(x − Φ) +

1
z

= 0,

(8.1)

with Φ representing the scalar SU (N ) matrix of the Coulomb branch parameters. The
SW diﬀerential is given by

The SW curve we ﬁnd for the SU (N|M ) gauge theory is given again by the same
formula except that the determinant is replaced with the super-determinant:

In this form we recognize this as the SW curve for SU (N ) theory with 2M fundamental
ﬂavors with two fundamentals of masses bj.

We will now derive the above results using negative branes in string theory in two

diﬀerent ways, as well as check them against the instanton calculus of Nekrasov.

8.4 The brane perspective
As discussed in §8.2, following the construction in [36], we can construct N = 2 su-
persymmetric SU (N|M ) gauge theories by suspending N ordinary D4-branes and M

– 44 –

Figure 12: A conﬁguration of D4 branes suspended between two NS5 branes that

SU (N ) theory.

negative D4-branes between two parallel (ordinary) NS5-branes. We now show how we
can use this picture to obtain the SW curve for this theory.

As a warmup exercise, let us consider an SU (N + k) theory with 2k ﬂavors, where
the Coulomb branch and ﬂavor masses are such that the SU (N + k) theory can be
Higgsed to an SU (N ) theory as depicted in Figure 12. In other words we are now in
a conﬁguration where we can remove k D4-branes that pass through both NS5-branes.
This subspace of mass and Coulomb branch parameters of the SU (N + k) theory with
2k ﬂavors will have the same SW geometry as a pure SU (N ) theory because the hyper-
multiplet and Coulomb branch moduli spaces are decoupled. We could have described
this setup in an “inverse” manner: adding extra D4 branes that pass through both
NS5-branes of the pure SU (N ) theory does not change the geometry of the Coulomb
branch. We now use this idea to solve for the SW curve of the SU (N|M ) theory.

The idea is simple: Consider now the brane realization of a N = 2 SU (N|M )
gauge theory and introduce M additional ordinary D4-branes which pass through both
NS5-branes. As already discussed, this will not aﬀect the SW geometry of the Coulomb
branch. Next, move these additional M D4-branes so that they coincide with the M
negative D4 branes in the region between the two NS5-branes.
In this way, the M
D4-branes and M negative D4-branes cancel each other out in the region between
the parallel NS5-branes and we are left with only positive branes! More precisely,
the resulting conﬁguration consists of N ordinary D4-branes suspended between the
NS5-branes, M semi-inﬁnite ordinary D4-branes attached to the ‘outside’ of one NS5-
brane and M semi-inﬁnite D4-branes attached the ‘outside’ of the other NS5-brane,

two NS5 branes that reproduces a SU (N|M ) gauge theory. It can be deformed to a
SU (N ) theory with 2M ﬂavors.

see Figure 12. This conﬁguration is exactly the same as the brane construction for a
SU (N ) theory with 2M ﬂavors where the masses of the ﬂavors are pairwise equal to
the Coulomb branch parameters for the U (M ) ⊂ SU (N|M ) part of the theory and
hence leads to the SW curve given in (8.5).

Incidentally, the construction we have discussed here also explains some of the
results in [37] where it was shown that N and M D3-branes ending on opposite sides
of an NS5-brane engineer a U (N|M ) Chern-Simons theory on the three dimensional
boundary. This conﬁguration can be derived from the present set up by considering
N ordinary D3 branes and M negative D3 branes on the same side, which manifestly
realizes a N = 4 U (N|M ) theory and naturally leads to a U (N|M ) Chern-Simons
theory on the boundary in the same fashion. Adding M ordinary D3 branes passing
through the NS5-branes and coinciding with the negative D3 branes reproduces the two-
sided conﬁguration (involving only positive D3 branes) realizing a boundary U (N|M )
Chern-Simons theory as described in [37].

8.5 Geometric engineering and mirror symmetry

Next we use geometric engineering to identify the SW geometry. Let us recall how
this is done in the SU (N ) case [38, 39] and then generalize the construction to the
supergroup case.

We consider an AN−1 singularity in ordinary type IIA string theory,

xN = uv,

(8.6)

– 46 –

NS5NS5ND4+MMMNMND4−Mwhich gives rise to a SU (N ) gauge theory in d = 6. We then compactify this theory
on a P1 which gives rise to an N = 2, SU (N ) gauge theory in d = 4. Next, we apply
mirror symmetry to this geometry to obtain a type IIB geometry, which leads to the
SW geometry. The mirror geometry can be assembled in pieces: The mirror of P1 leads
to the z + 1/z monomial and the mirror of SU (N ) geometry leads to det(Φ − x) = uv,
the total being the local Calabi-Yau 3-fold geometry

z + det(Φ − x) +

1
z

= uv.

(8.7)

As usual, the SW curve is the surface where we set the right hand side of the above
equation equal to zero. Now we apply the same idea to a SU (N|M ) theory with N = 2.
Here, to engineer a geometry corresponding to the SU (N|M ) theory we require a multi-
center Taub-NUT geometry, speciﬁcally with N positive charge and M negative charge
centers, as discussed in §4.

Moreover, since mirror symmetry in two complex dimensions is simply a hyperK¨ahler
rotation, to get the type IIB mirror we only need to write the complex geometry asso-
ciated with this TN geometry. Recall that the standard Taub-NUT space on S1 × R3
is given by

where the Ni are positive integers and A is the vector potential dual to V , ∂iV =

where θ and θ(cid:48) are the local coordinates on S1 associated to vector potentials with

v ∧ dx. This describes a collection of
with the holomorphic two-form Ω = du
ANi−1 singularities at the points u = v = 0, x = xi, corresponding to the Taub-NUT
charges located at (cid:126)y = (cid:126)yi.

u ∧ dx = − dv

The above analysis can be extended to the case with both positive and negative
Taub-NUT charges Ni, with the result that the right-hand side of (8.13) will contain
poles as well as zeros. This can be cast in terms of a superdeterminant with eigenvalues
ai, bj:

sdet(Φ − x) =

(8.14)

(cid:81)
(cid:81)
i(x − ai)
j(x − bj)

Putting these two pieces together we obtain the mirror geometry

z + sdet(Φ − x) +

1
z

= 0 ,

(8.15)

as was to be shown.

There is an interesting subtlety in this derivation. By construction, every point
in the Taub-NUT geometry is mapped to a point on the complex hypersurface (8.14),
but the mapping is not one-to-one in the presence of poles (negatively charged). Since
x = y1 + iy2 and arg u = θ are shared between the two descriptions, the injectivity of
the map depends on

∂ log |u|

∂y3 = V .

(8.16)

So long as V > 0 everywhere (or V < 0 everywhere), the map is one-to-one, but
precisely when Ni < 0 for some i, there is a V = 0 surface surrounding each negative
charge, and the map is not one-to-one in this vicinity.33

In other words, the Taub-NUT geometry is a multiple cover of (8.14), with a
complicated and unusual map between the two near the negative charges. Since the
Seiberg-Witten curve depends only on the complex structure, it is possible that this
subtlety does not aﬀect its calculation. However, this point deserves further study,
which might provide additional insight into the dynamics of the corresponding N = 2
supergroup gauge theory.

8.6 Instanton Calculus
We can also use Nekrasov’s instanton calculus. It is easiest to ﬁrst study the SU (N|N )
case and then generalize to SU (N|M ) for N > M case by taking N−M of the Coulomb
branch parameters for the SU (0|M ) part to be large. One way to solve for the SW curve

33It is interesting to note that this V = 0 surface is also a signature-changing singularity.

– 48 –

of the SU (N|N ) theory, as was explained to us by Nekrasov, is to relate this problem
to the following ordinary N = 2 theory: SU (N ) × SU (N ) with two bifundamentals
where the coupling constantes of the two SU (N )s have opposite signs τ1 = −τ2, or in
the exponentiated form, q1q2 = 1. The reason this comes about is that if we ﬁrst break
the SU (N|M ) theory to a SU (N ) × SU (M ) theory, the oﬀ-diagonal blocks, which
are fermionic, have ghosts associated with them that behave as if they are ordinary
matter. Therefore, the N = 2 instanton calculus and localization computation maps
the supergroup case to the ordinary N = 2 case noted above, with one restriction:
Since there is only one coupling τ in the SU (N|N ) theory and the coupling of the
SU (N|0) and SU (0|N ) theories diﬀer by a sign, because of the supertrace we need
to impose τ1 = −τ2 = τ . Of course this is diﬀerent from the physical region of the
SU (N )× SU (N ) theory where Im τ1 and Im τ2 are both positive. Nevertheless we can
analytically continue the answer for the SU (N )× SU (N ) theory to the case of interest
for the supergroup case.

The SW curve for the SU (N ) × SU (N ) with two bi-fundamental matter ﬁelds has

been worked out in [40] (see (7.81)) and was found to be:

where P1(x) and P2(x) are the polynomials controlling the Coulomb branches of the two

9 Potential Issues and Concluding Remarks

In this section, we discuss some potential issues with the ideas discussed in this paper
and their possible resolution. We hope to address some of these issues in future work.

9.1 The Cauchy problem

Field theories with multiple times generically do not have a well posed initial value
problem. While the spacetime can be foliated by choosing a ﬁducial time direction,
the initial value surface now has mixed signature, implying that signals can propagate
along the surface, rather than just forwards in “time”. This means that for generic
initial data there is no solution to the ﬁeld equations. A solution can be guaranteed by
specifying initial data on a spacelike hypersurface, but these have codimension greater
than one, so the resulting solution is highly non-unique.

While this naively seems to rule out classical determinism in a theory with multiple
times, the issue can be solved—at least in the free ﬁeld case [41, 42]—by imposing
constraints on the initial data suﬃcient to guarantee a solution. As analyzed in [41],
a suﬃcient condition is to restrict the support of the initial data to spacelike/null
momenta along the initial value surface. This is an interesting, non-local constraint
on the physics which also removes unstable exponentially growing and decaying modes
from the theory.

While it remains unproven whether a similar condition can be applied to an in-
teracting theory, this suggests that issues with determinism in multiple time theories
may be circumventable. A more thorough development of this topic would be of great
physical and mathematical interest.

9.2 Stability

If negative branes exist then ordinary string theory is potentially unstable. For instance,
in type IIA string theory negative D0 branes have negative squared mass, and appear to
be tachyons. More generally, nothing seems to prevent the pair creation of an arbitrary
number of negative branes, a process which releases energy due to their negative tension.
We suggest two possible resolutions. Firstly, one could speculate that this problem
is analogous to that encountered by Dirac in quantizing the electron ﬁeld. Perhaps what
is required is an appropriate analog of “ﬁlling the negative brane sea.” Unfortunately,
branes do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle, so it is unclear how “ﬁlling the sea”
will prevent the instability, but some yet unknown variation of this idea may succeed.
More concretely, we have seen that negative branes induce a dynamic change of
spacetime signature. This suggests that it is perhaps too naive to treat them as negative
energy probes. In particular, while we have focused exclusively on BPS conﬁgurations

– 50 –

of branes, brane pair creation is inherently non-BPS, and it may be that the spacetime
associated to negative brane pair creation actually has positive energy, due to the need
to create a bubble connecting to one of the exotic string theory vacua. Indeed, large
contributions to the energy may arise from the divergent background ﬁelds near the
singular signature-changing domain wall.

Unfortunately, while this idea is plausible, it is nearly impossible to check: the
only reason we have been able to work with singular spacetimes with any conﬁdence is
the high degree of supersymmetry involved. Calculating the tension of the signature-
changing domain wall without supersymmetry is presently out of reach. One approach
would be to study negative D0 branes exclusively and seek a smooth solution describing
their pair creation in the M-theory lift. Even this is technically quite involved, and we
will not attempt it in the present work.

Another process of interest is the mixing between vacua with no branes and those
with mutually BPS coincident pairs of positive and negative branes. Since the brane
tensions and charges cancel, these vacua are nearly indistinguishable from each other,
and there may be instantons connecting them. If so, the true vacuum of the theory will
involve a superposition, and may realize the vague notion of “ﬁlling the sea” discussed
above.

Addressing such questions of stability is imperative for the consistency of negative
branes and the associated exotic string theories. We leave this as an important open
problem for future work.

9.3 Complex actions and holography

Another confusing aspect of many of the exotic string and ﬁeld theories we have de-
scribed are the complex eﬀective actions that naturally appear, as we saw in the context
of R4 corrections in §5–7. However, in some situations this appears to be a feature, not
a bug. Besides the natural connection between imaginary curvature corrections and
branch cuts in the λ-plane that we discovered in §5, holography with emergent time
such as the dS/CFT correspondence [43] appears to be another such example. Con-
ventional logic implies that CFTs dual to de Sitter space are pure Euclidean. However,
a holographic representation of quantum mechanics will necessarily lead to complex
amplitudes, reproducing the familiar quantum phase factors eiS/
. This suggests that
the corresponding Euclidean CFT should have a complex, or even purely imaginary
action.

Note that the path-integral for a Euclidean supergroup gauge theory

(cid:90)

[DA] ei(cid:82) Str F 2 ,

– 51 –

(9.1)

is less problematic then the (Wick-rotated) Lorentzian case, since it is merely rapidly
oscillating instead of divergent, and may admit a convergent regulator. Of course, the
issue with complex actions in the exotic string theories we consider is somewhat more
severe because, unlike the above example, these actions do not have a deﬁnite phase.
Nonetheless, while puzzling in its implications for semiclassical dynamics, a complex
eﬀective action is not obviously inconsistent.

9.4 Consistency of the low energy limit
In section §6 we have attempted to extract as much information as possible about the
exotic string theories from their low energy eﬀective actions. This is advantageous,
as these actions are perhaps simpler to work with than any worldsheet description,
are available in M-theory as well as string theory, and are derived from dualities and
known results (unlike the consistent but conjectural Euclidean worldsheet description
developed in §7).

Nonetheless, there could be problems with taking the low energy limit in a theory
without a positive-deﬁnite notion of energy. Because of the existence of negative en-
ergy excitations, in principle such a theory can generate high energy excitations from
minimal input energy. If this occurs, the low-energy eﬀective description would likely
be invalidated. However, the solution to the stability problem mentioned above may
prevent this from happening. So long as negative energy excitations only appear oﬀ
shell and not in the ﬁnal state, high energy modes cannot be produced on shell either,
and an eﬀective ﬁeld theory approach may still be justiﬁed.

To illustrate these issues, we consider the exotic string theories IIB+−

9,1 and IIB−+
9,1 .
These can be described as M-theory on a mixed signature torus T 1,1 in the small
volume limit, by analogy with the usual M-theory construction of F-theory. Similar to
the discussion in §9.1 above, null rays can propagate along the T 1,1 due to its mixed
signature. As a result, some KK modes will be massless for most choices of metric on
T 1,1. In particular, the KK mode masses are

that naive dimensional reduction on T 1,1 may be inconsistent.
R4 corrections at strong coupling To further illustrate the problem, we reconsider
the calculation of the R4 corrections in these theories. Our discussion in §6 ignored
non-perturbative corrections in gs, which are present in type IIB string theory, and
are generated by integrating out the KK modes on T 2 in the M-theory description,
or equivalently by D-instantons in the type IIB description. In ordinary IIB++

corrections take the form [29]

We can attempt to regulate (9.7), of course, but most regulators will break modular

invariance. There are two simple possibilities that respect modular invariance:

1. Assume that Im τ± (cid:54)= 0. The sum converges, and is invariant under τ± → aτ±+b
cτ±+d ,
but we cannot restrict | Im τ±| (cid:28) 1 in a modular invariant fashion, so the under-
lying physics is complexiﬁed.

2. Assume that τ± ∈ Q∪{∞} and remove the terms from the sum where n/m = τ+
or n/m = τ−. The result converges and is modular invariant, but is not a smooth
function of τ±.

Both approaches have their disadvantages.36 Ideally, we might like a smooth modular
invariant function of real τ±, but this can be shown to be impossible.37

We will not attempt a deﬁnitive resolution this puzzle in the present paper. The
appearance of complex actions discussed above suggests that the ﬁrst option may be the
right one. We note, however, that the second option has an intriguing parallel to §9.1,
in that we remove by hand certain Fourier modes along T 1,1, in this case those with null
momenta. In type IIB language, this corresponds to removing certain tensionless (p, q)
string bound states,38 whereas in M-theory language we remove the massless non-zero
modes. This cures the problems with the KK spectrum (9.2), in that the number of
KK modes with mass below any ﬁxed threshold is ﬁnite.

Moreover, the series (9.7) now has a ﬁnite sum. Consider the generalized Eisenstein-

(cid:19)s

for τ± ∈ Q ∪ {∞}, τ+ (cid:54)= τ−, where  > 0 indicates the choice of branch cut. This can
n=0(x + n)−s.
36Another possibility would be to form new modular invariant combinations, similar to what is done
for theta functions for indeﬁnite lattices. We leave the study of such a possibility to future work.
37Suppose that f (τ+, τ−) is smooth for generic τ± and modular invariant. Deﬁne f+(τ+) = f (τ+,∞),
f−(τ−) = f (∞,−τ−). Because the modular group maps ∞ to every rational point, f± must also
be smooth at a generic point by assumption. Modular invariance requires f±(x + 1) = f±(x) and
f+(a/c) = f−(d/c) for any a, d, c such that ad ≡ 1 (mod c). Using a = p2k, d = q2k, c = pqk + 1
for any p, q, k, we conclude that f+(p2x) − f−(q2x) has zeroes xk = k
accumulate near x = 1/pq, implying a singularity there unless the diﬀerence vanishes everywhere.
Therefore, if f±(x) both have smooth regions, then f+(p2x) − f−(q2x) for more than one value of
p, q (cid:54)= 0, but then f±(x + 1) = f±(x) implies f±(x) is constant, therefore f (τ+, τ−) is also constant.
38Another possibility is that the correct low-energy description is a higher spin theory generated by

(cid:0)1 − 1

(cid:1) which

mations which ﬁx τ+ = ∞ map q → q + np (τ− → τ− + n), so the result is indeed
modular invariant.

The regulated R4 correction is then proportional to f (τ+, τ−) = ζ(3) ˜E±

(τ+, τ−) for
some choice of branch cut we do not attempt to ﬁx. This result is interesting and ﬁnite,
but it is unclear how to interpret the τ± dependence as a coupling to the background
ﬁelds C0 and Φ, since the latter are continuous dynamical ﬁelds.

The above example demonstrates that low energy eﬀective description we have used
in parts of our paper may be subject to important corrections or even may break down
entirely in some cases. This bears further consideration.

9.5 Concluding Thoughts

In this paper we argued that two unusual ideas about gauge theory and string theory are
connected. Previous work has explored, on the one hand, the possibility of supergroup
gauge theories and their connection to negative branes in string theory [3–5], and on the
other hand, the possibility of exotic spacetime signatures and timelike compactiﬁcations
in string theory [2, 15–17]. We have shown that these two ideas are directly related. In
particular, negative D0 branes arise from a smooth M-theory background with an S1
that becomes timelike near the branes, giving a dynamic change of spacetime signature
in the type IIA description. Using duality arguments, all other types of negative branes
can be related to dynamic signature changes and the exotic string theories originally
explored by Hull.

It remains possible that neither of these ideas is consistent, in which case we have
added nothing to the general knowledge of string theory and gauge theory. However,
the deep connections we have found between these two seemingly disparate areas are
intriguing, and provide circumstantial evidence that both may actually be realized in
string theory.

In our paper we have presented both consistency checks and puzzles. The most
promising approach to deﬁnitively establish the existence of these exotic string theories
would be to non-perturbatively construct supergroup gauge theories in four dimensions,
e.g., on a lattice, which would in principle prove the existence of the exotic string theory
IIB−−
3,7 via the AdS/CFT correspondence. While this remains a diﬃcult (though perhaps

– 55 –

not impossible) problem, understanding supermatrix models is a small step in the right
direction [3, 6].

A Duality and eﬀective actions in various signatures

To determine the supergravity actions for the exotic string theories obtained by time-
like compactiﬁcation and T-duality, all we need to do is keep track of the two-derivative
eﬀective action during compactiﬁcation. Our approach is to consider a general com-
pactiﬁcation of the supergravity actions posited in §4.2 and to show that these actions
are related to each other under KK reduction and T-duality as claimed in the text. Af-
ter matching the actions to known results for the standard string theories, this shows
that the exotic string theories have the low energy eﬀective actions given in §4.2.

In §A.1 we consider the dimensional reduction from eleven-dimensional supergrav-
ity to type IIA supergravity, in §A.2–A.4 we discuss T-duality between type IIA and
type IIB supergravities, and in §A.5 we discuss S-duality in type IIB supergravities. A
computation of the Ricci scalar for KK reduction in arbitrary spacetime signature is
included in §A.6 for completeness.

A.5 Einstein frame and S-duality

The above discussion covers all possible T-dualities between type IIA and type IIB
theories, as well as S-dualities between type IIA theories and M theories, at the two
derivative level. This is suﬃcient to connect any two theories by dualities, hence to
derive the two-derivative eﬀective action for all of the exotic string theories considered
by Hull. As a further consistency check, we verify the S-dualities between type IIB
theories shown in Figures 3, 4 at the two derivative level.

The spectrum of branes is only invariant for a, b, c, d ∈ Z, so that the symmetry of the
full theory is SL(2, Z).

Note that for αβ = +1, we can choose j = i so that τ is a complex number, whereas
for αβ = −1, j generates the split complex numbers. In the former case, τ → aτ +b
cτ +d
maps the upper half plane Im τ > 0 to itself, whereas in the latter it does not.
In
cases where Im τ(cid:48) < 0 we can redeﬁne τ → τ∗, G3 → G∗
3 to ﬁx Im τ > 0, but this
maps β → −β with αβ = −1 ﬁxed, exchanging IIB+− with IIB−+. This implies that
for C0 = 0 IIB+− and IIB−+ are S-dual (related by τ → −1/τ ). More generally, it is
convenient to think of IIB+− and IIB−+ as occupying the upper and lower half of the
split-complex plane, with τ → aτ +b
cτ +d mapping some points to the same half plane and
some to the opposite. By contrast, for IIB++ and IIB−− τ is conﬁned to the upper half
of the complex plane, and the theory is self-dual for any τ .

A.6 Riemann tensor computation

We consider the metric ansatz:

dˆs2

d+1 = ds2

d + ηyye2λ(dy + A)2 = ηijθiθj + ηyyθ2 ,

(A.37)

where ηij and ηyy are arbitrary constants (allowing any signature), and θ = eλ(dy + A).
We compute:

dθ = dλ ∧ θ + eλF ,

dθi = −ωi

j ∧ θj ,

(A.38)
d and F ≡ dA. The solution to Cartan’s structure

where ωi

j is the spin connection for ds2

(A.39)

where ˆωi

j is the spin connection for dˆs2

d+1.

To compute the curvature two-form, we note that all factors of ωi
j = Ri

cancel from the result by general covariance, except for derivatives of ωi
dωi
undiﬀerentiated. We then have:

j must eventually

j = 0 without loss of generality where it appears

k, so we can set ωi

j − ωi

j ∧ ωj

j = 0(cid:1) ,

and the Ricci scalar R = ηABiEARB:
ˆR = R − 1

ηyye2λF ijFij − 2e−λ∇2eλ .

This result can be combined with the well-known conformal transformation of the Ricci
scalar to generalize the ansatz. For dˆs2

d = e2ωds2

d we have

e2ω ˆR = R − (d − 1)(d − 2)(∇ω)2 − 2(d − 1)∇2ω ,

e2ω ˆ∇2φ = ∇2φ + (d − 2)∇ω · ∇φ .

Thus, for the more general ansatz

dˆs2

d+1 = e2ωds2

d + ηyye2λ(dy + A)2 ,

(A.47)

(A.48)

(A.49)

we obtain
