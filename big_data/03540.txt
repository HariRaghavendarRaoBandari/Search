Radiation pressure acceleration (RPA) is a highly eﬃcient mechanism of laser-driven ion accel-
eration, with with near complete transfer of the laser energy to the ions in the relativistic regime.
However, there is a fundamental limit on the maximum attainable ion energy, which is determined
by the group velocity of the laser. The tightly focused laser pulses have group velocities smaller
than the vacuum light speed, and, since they oﬀer the high intensity needed for the RPA regime,
it is plausible that group velocity eﬀects would manifest themselves in the experiments involving
tightly focused pulses and thin foils. However, in this case, ﬁnite spot size eﬀects are important,
and another limiting factor, the transverse expansion of the target, may dominate over the group
velocity eﬀect. As the laser pulse diﬀracts after passing the focus, the target expands accordingly
due to the transverse intensity proﬁle of the laser. Due to this expansion, the areal density of the
target decreases, making it transparent for radiation and eﬀectively terminating the acceleration.
The oﬀ-normal incidence of the laser on the target, due either to the experimental setup, or to the
deformation of the target, will also lead to establishing a limit on maximum ion energy.

INTRODUCTION

2

The particle acceleration is one of the cornerstones of the fundamental physics, enabling diﬀerent studies and ap-
plications. However, conventional technology of particle acceleration leads to large scale facilities, as well as high
construction and operation costs. Hence there is a signiﬁcant interest in advanced acceleration concepts that would
reduce the size and cost of future accelerators. One of the most promising concepts is the laser plasma acceleration
[1, 2], where the particles are accelerated by strong electromagnetic (EM) ﬁelds generated by laser pulses in plasma.
In particular, laser driven acceleration of electrons has made quite an impressive progress from 1979, when it was
proposed [3], to 2014 when a 4.25 GeV beam was accelerated by a PW-class laser in the 9 cm plasma channel at the
BELLA Center, LBNL [4].

The laser driven acceleration of ions [1, 5–7] has a longer history, starting from the scheme of acceleration proposed
by Veksler in 1957 [8]. However this area of laser plasma acceleration only recently has become a very active area of re-
search worldwide, due to numerous potential applications of laser driven ion sources, such as injectors for conventional
accelerators [9], hadron therapy of oncological diseases [10] (see for details review article [7] and references therein),
radiography [11], nuclear physics studies [13], studies of radiation damage and single event eﬀect in electronics, as
well as fast ignition inertial conﬁnement fusion [12], and drivers and probes for the studies of warm dense matter.
This interest is also due to the recent availability of ultrahigh power lasers with focused intensity up to 1022 W/cm2
[14] and laser pulse cleaning techniques that allow a temporal intensity contrast of 14 orders of magnitude [15]. New
and eﬃcient acceleration regimes were proposed, and some of them tested experimentally, giving rise to proton beams
with the energy of about 100 MeV from nm-scale foils of solid density [16–18].

The basic mechanisms of acceleration are (i) Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) [19], (ii) Coulomb Ex-
plosion (CE) [20], (iii) Radiation Pressure Acceleration (RPA) [21], and (iv) Magnetic Vortex Acceleration (MVA)
[22–24]. There are also several composite mechanisms, which are the either the combinations of basic ones or somehow
the enhancement of the basic ones, such as Break-Out-Afterburner (BOA) [25], Shock Wave Acceleration (SWA) [26],
Relativistic Transparency (RT) [27], and Directed Coulomb Explosion (DCE) [28]. Also the use of composite targets
(low density/high density or two layer - high Z/low Z) was proposed in a number of papers to either inject the ions
into accelerating ﬁelds, enhance the interaction of the laser pulse with the high density part of the target, mitigate
the eﬀect of instabilities, or alter the accelerated ion spectra [29–31].

All these mechanisms can be parametrized in terms of two dimensionless parameters, αa and δa, which are deﬁned

as

αa =

a0
εp

and δa =

√a0,

de
λ

(1)

where we assume a0 ≫ 1. The ﬁrst parameter αa is the ratio of normalized laser EM ﬁeld strength, a0 = eE0/meωc
to normalized to εp , which is a normalized surface density determined as [32]

εp =

2πe2nel
meωc

.

(2)

The second parameter δa is equal to the collisionless skin-depth ≈ de√a0, with de = c/ωpe and ωpe =p4πnee2/me,

normalized on λ = c/ω. We take also into account the relativistic dependence of the plasma frequency ωpe/√a0 on
the laser pulse amplitude assuming a0 ≫ 1. Here e and me are the electron charge and mass, E0 and ω are the ﬁeld
strength and frequency, c is the speed of light, ne is the electron density, and l is the target thickness. The parameter
αa can be written in the form αa = E0/Em, where Em = 2πenel is the maximum electric ﬁeld which can be produced
by a charge slab of the density ne and thickness l. The target can be considered as a thin foil provided its thickness
l is substantially less than the laser wavelength λ = 2πλ. In Fig. 1 the dashed parabolic curve l ≈ λ subdivides the
parameter plane in two sub-domains: a thin foil target for λ > l and an extended plasma for λ < l.
The condition a0 = εp, i. e. αa = 1, marks the threshold transparency for laser pulses interactions with a thin
foil target l ≪ λ (see Refs. [32] and [33]). In Fig. 1, the domains (I) and (II) correspond to overdense opaque and
transparent slab, respectively. If the laser radiation interacts with an opaque target in the parameter domain (I),
a relatively small portion of hot electrons can leave the target, forming a sheath with an electric charge separation.
The corresponding electric ﬁeld accelerates ions in the TNSA regime [19]. Above the line a0/εp = 1 (αa = 1),
i.e.
in the domain (II), the laser radiation is so intense that it blows out almost all electrons from the irradiated
region of the target. The remaining ions undergo fast expansion, known as Coulomb explosion, due to the repelling
of noncompensated positive electric charges [20]. At the opaqueness/transparency threshold, in the vicinity of the
a0/εp = 1 line in Fig. 1, the conditions for ion acceleration in the RPA regime are realized [21].
In the regions (III) and (IV), in Fig. 1, where de√a0/λ > 1, i. e. δa > 1, the plasma is underdense. We consider
here the case of near-critical density plasma when the high power laser pulse undergoes the relativistic self-focusing

3

[35, 36]. The laser pulse looses its energy with the energy depletion length equal to ldep = a0(ω/ωpe)2llas (e.g., see
Ref.
[23]). For an ultra-short (several wavelength) laser pulse, llas ≈ λ, the choice of the plasma target thickness l
equal to the energy depletion length, l = ldep, provides for maximum laser-target coupling [37]. This condition takes
the form l ≈ a0(cω/ω2
pe), i.e., equivalent to the condition a0/εp ≈ 1 at the border between the domains (III) and (IV)
in Fig. 1. Under this condition the laser pulse deposits almost all its energy in the plasma producing a large number
of fast electrons in the vicinity of the target rear surface. This results in quasi-static magnetic ﬁeld generation at the
plasma vacuum interface by the electric current carried by fast electrons [38], which is crucially important for the
magnetic vortex acceleration mechanism realization [22–24]. We note that eﬀectively the ion acceleration mechanisms
rad , where εrad is the parameter governing the strength
of the radiation reaction eﬀects [39]. The ﬁrst of these boundaries states that for increasingly underdense plasma the
ion acceleration mechanisms, which are mentioned in Fig. 1, cease to work. Such boundary for the MVA mechanism
is mentioned in Ref.
[23]. The second boundary corresponds to the threshold [39] of the radiation reaction and
quantum recoil eﬀects. These eﬀects for laser intensities larger than 1023 W/cm2 signiﬁcantly alter the process of ion
acceleration, which was illustrated in Refs. [40] for RPA regime and in Ref. [41] for relativistic transparency.

in Fig. 1 are bound by two conditions de/λ ≤ 1 and a0 ≤ ε−1/3

Most of the laser ion acceleration experimental results were obtained in the TNSA regime [5] with the maximum
proton energy around 70 MeV [16]. Using a high contrast, 200 TW, femtosecond-pulse laser irradiating a micron-
thickness Al foil target, the TNSA regime has produced 40 MeV protons [34]. Recently, several papers have been
published that claim the experimental observation of the onset of the RPA regime of laser ion acceleration [42], with
the maximum energy up to 93 MeV [18].
In the case of long pulses, the acceleration of helium atoms up to 40
MeV from underdense plasma was observed at the VULCAN laser [43], the acceleration of protons up to 50 MeV
at Omega EP [44], and there are some indications of reaching more than 100 MeV protons using the Trident laser
[17]. Also, experiments with short pulses and cluster jets show that 10-20 MeV per nucleon ions can be generated via
such interaction [45]. The experimental data is summarized in Fig. 2, along with the simulation results for proton
acceleration with 1-3 PW and 10 PW laser pulses. We also show by area colored in gray the interval of proton
energies relevant for the medical applications, which indicates that the experimentally obtained proton energies are
at the threshold of being applicable for hadron therapy. This plot is an updated version of the one published in Ref.
[47].

FIG. 1. The basic laser ion acceleration mechanisms in the plane of dimensionless parameters, a0/ǫp and de√a0/λ, characterizing
the laser amplitude and the target transparency.

Each of these ion acceleration mechanisms has its own scaling of maximum ion energy with laser pulse power,
intensity, or ﬂuence. Each mechanism is characterized by the operational parameter range and requires specially
designed targets in order to maximize the advantages of the particular mechanism and compensate for diﬀerent
limitations. For TNSA special target designs were considered, such as pizza-cone targets [16], nano structured targets

[48], thin foil targets with a thin layer deposited on the back, and thin foils with a low density slabs attached at the
front [29, 31]. Recently several target designs were proposed for other mechanisms, including mass limited targets,
RPA in a tube, and double shock formation in a gas jet for MVA [49].

FIG. 2. The experimental data on maximum observed proton energies for diﬀerent laser systems along with the simulation
results for 1-3 PW laser pulses and 10 PW laser pulses [5, 17, 18]. The range of proton energies relevant for medical applications
is shown by grey area.

In this work, we will address the RPA mechanism of ion acceleration and the factors limiting the maximum ion
energy gain. RPA comes into play when the laser is able to push the foil as a whole by its radiation pressure. The idea
goes back to the papers by Lebedev, Eddington [50], and Veksler [8], and has a close analogy, which was emphasized
in many papers on the subject, to the “light sail” scheme for spacecraft propulsion [51]. The RPA is the realization
of the relativistic receding mirror concept [52]. The role of a mirror is played by an ultra-thin solid density foil or
by plasma density modulations emerging when the laser interacts with an extended under-critical density target, the
so-called hole-boring RPA [53]. The problem of a plane EM wave reﬂection by a mirror moving with a relativistic
velocity was considered by A. Einstein as an illustration of the Theory of Special Relativity [54]. The frequency of the
reﬂected radiation is shifted down by a factor of 4γ 2
M , where γM is the Lorentz factor of the mirror. Thus the energy
transferred to the mirror is (1 − 1/4γ 2
M )Elas, where Elas is the energy of the laser pulse. For γM ≫ 1 almost all laser
energy is transferred to the foil, which makes this scheme very attractive in the ultrarelativistic limit [21]. However
there are a number of eﬀects that limit the energy transfer from the laser to the ions. We aim at identifying these
eﬀects and ﬁnding means to either compensate for the limitations or completely remove them through target design,
laser pulse shaping, or by changing the laser-target interaction. These eﬀects are (i) target transparency [56, 57], (ii)
sub-luminal laser group velocity [31, 46], (iii) transverse target expansion [31, 58], and (iv) laser oﬀ-normal incidence.
In order to achieve high eﬃciency of energy transfer from the laser to the foil in the
case of the RPA the foil should remain opaque for radiation during the acceleration process. However, opaque foils
should either have high density or be rather thick, or both. This would increase the number of ions in the irradiated
spot, thus decreasing the energy that the laser can transfer per ion. Therefore, if one wants to maximize the energy
per ion then the acceleration should happen at the threshold of the foil transparency/opacity, which is governed by
the reﬂection coeﬃcient. At this threshold, the foil is opaque for radiation, but this opaqueness is ensured by the
minimum possible number of ions. Thus, it was found in Ref. [56] the condition, a(t) = γ(t)εp(t), must be realized to
ensure optimal acceleration. This leads to an idea of laser pulse tailoring, so that the laser pulse has a special shape
that would ensure this condition is satisﬁed every instant of the laser pulse interaction with the target. The matching
of the laser pulse proﬁle leads to signiﬁcant reduction of the acceleration time and thus acceleration distance. This
is a critical parameter for the RPA scheme of laser ion acceleration, since the acceleration distance is of the order
of the required Rayleigh length for the high intensity laser systems. Therefore, the incident laser pulse of the form
described in [56] oﬀers a reasonable approach to compact laser ion accelerator, with relaxed requirements on the total

(i) Target transparency.

laser pulse energy needed to achieve certain accelerated ion energy.

(ii) Laser group velocity. Usually the energy gain in the RPA regime for the ultra-relativistic case is estimated
using the relativistic mirror concept as (1− 1/4γ 2
M )Elas. The eﬀect of the EM wave group velocity being smaller than
the vacuum light speed are not taken into account in this case. It is well known that group velocity eﬀects play a
major role in laser driven electron acceleration [2] and should modify the RPA. If this eﬀect is taken into account,
then the energy gain in this case is proportional to the diﬀerence between the instantaneous foil velocity, β, and the
laser group velocity, βg, ∆E ≈ 2γ 2β(β − βg)Elas [31, 46]. A laser pulse can not accelerate the foil to the velocity larger
than its group velocity.
(iii) Transverse target expansion. The high intensity needed for the RPA regime is usually oﬀered by tightly focused
laser pulses, which have group velocities smaller than the vacuum light speed. So it is plausible to expect that the
group velocity eﬀects will manifest themselves in experiments involving such tightly focused pulses and thin foils.
However, in this case, ﬁnite size spot eﬀects [58] are important, and another limiting factor, the transverse target
expansion will dominate in limiting maximum ion energy [31]. The transverse expansion is caused by the diﬀraction
of the tightly focused laser pulse, resulting in the decrease of the target areal density, which eﬀectively terminates the
acceleration.

The utilization of external guiding may relax the constraints on maximum attainable ion energy mainly imposed by
transverse expansion. Namely, the use of a composite target having a thin foil followed by an NCD slab. The NCD
slab provided guiding of the laser pulse during the acceleration process. The comparison of a single foil RPA and a
composite target RPA shows that, in the latter case, the ions have energy several times larger than in the former case,
thus greatly increasing the eﬀectiveness of the RPA regime of laser-driven ion acceleration. In such a conﬁguration,
the group velocity eﬀects begin to dominate and determine the maximum achievable ion energy [31].

(iv) Laser oﬀ-normal incidence. The laser ion acceleration by the radiation pressure in the case of an oﬀ-normal
incidence of the laser pulse gives rise to another limit to the maximum attainable ion energy. Oﬀ-normal incidence is
routinely used in many experiments on laser ion acceleration to reduce the chance of damaging the laser system by
the reﬂected light. The limit on the maximum ion energy is determined by the angle of incidence. If the oﬀ-normal
incidence is considered for the pulse with βg < 1, then the maximum ion velocity is βmax = βg cos θ. The limit is
due to the fact that at some moment during the interaction the foil velocity becomes so large that the longitudinal
component of the EM wave vector vanishes in the rest frame of the foil. This eﬀect implies that the tightly focused
pulses are not beneﬁcial for the RPA of ions. For such pulses, the foil quickly becomes deformed during the initial stage
of interaction, resulting in a curved target. Then, locally the interaction can be viewed as an oﬀ-normal incidence
with the limiting velocity βg cos θ(r, z), where θ(r, z) corresponds to the local value of the angle of incidence. This
results in a power-law spectrum of ions, preventing the development of the mono energetic features.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we review the eﬀects of the target transparency on the RPA regime
and the laser pulse shaping to compensate for these eﬀects [56]. In section 3 we review the group velocity limitations
[31, 46]. The transverse expansion eﬀects [31] are reviewed in section 4. The consequences of the oﬀ-normal incidence
of a laser pulse on a foil are addressed in section 5, together with the preliminary considerations on the interaction of
the laser pulse with a deformed target in the RPA regime. We conclude in section 6.

II. TARGET TRANSPARENCY EFFECTS

In what follows we review the eﬀects of target transparency on the RPA regime. It has been noted in a number
of papers [56, 57] that evolving target transparency signiﬁcantly changes the evolution of the ion energy. The target
transparency leads to reduction in acceleration eﬀectiveness and to the notion of the optimal target thickness that
maximizes the ion energy for ﬁxed laser pulse. The motion of the foil under the action of the laser pulse radiation
pressure is described by the equation (we set c = 1 below throughout the paper) [21]

where β = dx/dt is the foil velocity, x(t) is the position of the foil, and EL(ψ) is the laser pulse ﬁeld, which depends
on the variable ψ = t − x(t). Here ρ is the reﬂection coeﬃcient and α is the absorption coeﬃcient. These coeﬃcients
are connected through the energy conservation condition, |ρ|2 +|τ|2 +|α|2 = 1, where τ is the transmission coeﬃcient.
The solution of Eq. (3) for the foil initially at rest, β(0) = 0, assuming total reﬂection (i.e., ρ = 1), is

The fact that the foil may be transparent for radiation signiﬁcantly modiﬁes the acceleration process. Consider the

In the case of an opaque foil almost all radiation is reﬂected and ar is determined by the incident EM ﬁeld amplitude.
In the case of a transparent foil, the reﬂected EM wave amplitude is determined by the current the incident wave can
drive in the foil, which is proportional to εp.

The parameter εp plays an important role in determining the optimal regime of acceleration (see Fig. 1) [60]. For
a foil at rest the condition a0 = εp marks the threshold of opacity/transparency of the foil to radiation [32]. At
this threshold the opacity is maintained by the minimum possible number of ions, which means that if the EM wave
transfers some amount of its energy to the foil, the amount of absorbed energy per ion is maximal. For the case of
non-relativistic ion energies the condition a0 = εp marks the regime of laser-foil interaction, which maximizes the
accelerated ion energy (see Ref.
[60]). However, in the general case, the foil velocity, as well as the fact that εp is
not relativistically invariant, should be taken into account. Therefore the condition a0 = εp should be replaced by
a0 = γεp [56]. In order to maximize the eﬀect of the matching of the laser pulse to the foil the condition a0 = γεp
should be satisﬁed at every instant of time during the acceleration process. To achieve such matching a tailored laser
proﬁle is required. Assuming that this condition is satisﬁed, the equation of the foil motion is

dβ

(10)

This equation can be solved numerically, and the results are shown in Fig. 3 for εp = 25, 50, and 100. Here we
assumed that the foil is made of hydrogen, mi = mp. The dependence of the proton energy on time demonstrates
linear behavior (Fig. 3a). This is drastically diﬀerent from the case of a constant amplitude laser pulse, where the
energy grows as ∼ t1/3 [21] (see Fig. 3b). Therefore in the case of a proﬁled laser pulse the time needed to reach
certain ion energy is signiﬁcantly smaller, which may lead to a reduction in size of laser ion accelerators.
The condition, a0 = γεp, which was used in deriving Eq. (10), allows reconstruction of the proﬁle of the laser pulse,
which is shown in Fig. 3c. The laser ﬁeld determined by this proﬁle is inversely proportional to ψ − ψ∗, where ψ∗ is a

function of the parameter εp. In order to study the behavior of the proﬁled laser pulse analytically and estimate the
value ψ∗, the case of ultrarelativistic ion energies is considered. For the ultra-relativistic case, the ﬁeld of the laser
pulse can be found from the solution of Eq. (10) [56]:

a =

εp

1 − ψ/ψ∗

, where ψ∗ =

(11)

is the maximum duration of the pulse. If we compare this solution, Eq. (11), with the numerical solution of Eq. (10)
(see Fig. 3), then, ﬁrst, one can see the inverse proportionality of the ﬁeld amplitude to ψ − ψ∗, and, second, the
analytical estimate for ψ∗ approximately reproduces the numerical solution (see Fig. 3c). Note here that one of the
most serious issues with the RPA of thin foils is the development of the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability [63] (see
also Ref. [55]), whose growth rate is comparable with the acceleration time, and which can eﬀectively terminate the
acceleration. However, according to the results of Ref.
[59, 63], the laser proﬁle given by Eq. (11) suppresses the
development of the RT instability.

The numerical solution of the equation of motion indicates that the proﬁled laser pulse is able to accelerate ions to
some ﬁxed energy in a signiﬁcantly smaller period of time, than a constant amplitude laser pulse. Using the solutions
of the equation of motion in these two cases yields the relation between the acceleration times assuming that both
pulses have the same total energy. The durations, τlas and Tlas, are related to each other by Tlas = τlas/(1− τlas/ψ∗),
where Tlas is for a constant amplitude pulse and τlas for proﬁled laser. In the limit of t → ∞ the acceleration times
are [56]

for the constant amplitude and proﬁled laser, respectively. The acceleration time in the case of a constant amplitude
laser pulse is signiﬁcantly longer than in the case of a proﬁled pulse:

Tacc

(13)

For example, let us assume that the proﬁled pulse duration is τlas = 0.9ψ∗, which is ten times smaller then the
duration of the constant amplitude pulse having the same total energy. The acceleration time for the proﬁled pulse
in this case is approximately one hundred times smaller: tacc ≈ 10−2Tacc. Thus the proﬁling of laser pulses may lead
to a signiﬁcant reduction of the length of laser ion accelerators based on the RPA mechanism.

III. GROUP VELOCITY EFFECT

The group velocity of the laser pulse being smaller than the vacuum light speed imposes a fundamental limit on the
maximum attainable ion energy during the RPA of a thin foil. The naive estimate shows that the target energy gain
is proportional to the diﬀerence between the instantaneous foil velocity and the laser group velocity [31, 46],

∆E ≈ 2γ 2β(β − βg)Elas.

(14)

Thus, in principle, the laser pulse with βg < 1 can only accelerate the foil up to the velocity equal to its group velocity
βmax = βg. If we take this eﬀect into account, then the equation of motion of the foil under the action of the laser
pulse radiation pressure takes the form diﬀerent from the one used in the previous section [31, 46]:

dβ
dt

= κβg(1 − β2)1/2(βg − β)(1 − ββg).

(15)

From Eq. (15) one can see that if the instantaneous velocity of the foil becomes equal to the laser group velocity, the
right hand side of the equation vanishes, the acceleration is terminated, and the foil has reached maximum attainable
velocity. The solution of Eq. (15) can be written in the following form for β(0) = 0:

(17)

When time tends to inﬁnity and assuming constant amplitude laser pulse, Kβ(t) = κt, the following scaling for the
foil velocity is obtained as β approaches βg (here it is assumed that the foil stays opaque during the acceleration
process, |ρ| = 1):

β = βg − exp(cid:16)−βg(1 − β2

g )3/2κt(cid:17) .

(18)

Thus the ion energy is limited by γg = 1/q1 − β2

g .

We note that the limitation of the achievable ion energy by γg implies the adiabatic regime of the laser pulse
interaction with a thin foil target. In the case of non-adiabatic interaction (it may correspond to the laser pulse with
a gradual proﬁle, which requires additional consideration, which will be carried out in the forthcoming publications),
the upper limit on the accelerated ion energy is imposed by 2mic2γ 2
g . We may compare the laser wake ﬁeld acceleration
scaling in ’non-adiabatic’ [2, 3] and ’adiabatic’ [64] regimes. In the standard ’non-adiabatic’, regime the electron energy
is proportional to the square of the Lorentz gamma-factor calculated for the laser-driver group velocity, γe ≈ 2γ 2
g ,
[2, 3]. The ’adiabatic’ case is realized for the laser-target parameters providing the non-phase-slippage conditions
when γe ≈ 2γ 2
In Fig. 4a we present the numerical solution of Eq. (16) for Gaussian pulses with a duration of 27 fs (10 cycles),
λ = 800 nm wavelength, f-number of f /D = 1 and f /D = 1.5, interacting with a 0.25λ thick hydrogen foil with an
electron density of 400ncr. The evolution of the maximum ion energy is shown for the averaged laser power of 1.8
PW. One can see that for f /D = 1.5 the diﬀerence between the βg = 1 and βg < 1 curves is small since the laser
g . However the diﬀerence is clearly seen
in the case of f /D = 1. The curve corresponding to βg < 1 is limited by the group velocity, while the βg = 1 curve
continues to grow. Thus the numerical solution of the equation of motion demonstrates the eﬀect of the laser group
velocity being smaller than the vacuum light speed.

ﬂuence is not high enough to push the ions up to the energy γg = 1/q1 − β2

g [64], which results in unlimited electron acceleration.

IV. TRANSVERSE EXPANSION EFFECT

The ﬁnite focal spot eﬀects play an important role in laser driven ion acceleration, especially using the RPA mecha-
nism. These eﬀects tend to cause the transverse expansion of the target, thus lowering target surface density nl and
increasing transparency. According to the results of the previous section, the increased target transparency reduces
the eﬀectiveness of acceleration and leads to the termination of the acceleration process. RPA usually requires high
laser intensities to operate. High intensities are generated by tightly focussing the laser radiation to a small focal spot,
which can be only a few wavelengths in size. Such a conﬁguration causes laser group velocity to be noticeably smaller

(19)

In order to detrmine the eﬀect of the transverse expansion on the maximum attainable ion energy, we consider the
acceleration of an on-axis element of the foil. In this case both the laser ﬁeld and the foil element can be approximated
by an expanding spherical cup with curvature radius equal to the laser waist, w(x). The transparency parameter εp
then scales as

with the distance from focus. Substituting Eqs. (19,20) in the equation of motion (15), we get the following equation
for the expanding foil under the action of a diverging laser pulse:

εp(x) = εp(0)(cid:2)1 + (x/LR)2(cid:3)−1

Note that the right hand side of the Eq. (15) depends on coordinate x only through the reﬂection coeﬃcient [56]
(see section 2). Thus the main contribution of the transverse expansion is the increased target transparency as the
acceleration evolves. It is plausible to assume that it will result in earlier termination of the acceleration and lower
maximum attainable ion energy.

The Eq.

(21) can be solved numerically, allowing for the comparison between the cases with and without the
transverse expansion taken into account. The results of the solution are shown shown in Fig. 4 for a 1.8 PW average
power laser pulse interacting with a 0.25λ thick hydrogen foil with the density of ne = 400ncr for three values of the
f-number: f /D = 1, f /D = 1.5, and f /D = 2. There are two sets of curves in Fig. 3a: (i) corresponding to f/D=1
and (ii) corresponding to f/D=1.5. In each set we compare three cases: no target expansion and laser divergence, and
βg = 1, no target expansion and laser divergence, and βg < 1, and target expansion and βg < 1. The target expansion
dominates in both sets, severely limiting the maximum attainable ion energy by early termination of the acceleration
process. This can be illustrated by the evolution of the value of the laser ﬁeld amplitude at the foil, see Fig. 3b. The
transverse expansion results in lower maximum value of the ﬁeld as well as the duration of its interaction with the
foil.

In order to compensate for the eﬀects of the transverse expansion and relax the limits on maximum attainable ion
energy, the laser foil interaction should be modiﬁed in a way that would preserve the surface density of the foil. This
would result in the foil being opaque for radiation during the acceleration. We propose to employ an external guiding
to satisfy the above mentioned requirements. The guiding can be modeled assuming that the laser pulse is guided
in a self-generated channel and the foil stays opaque for the pulse. We solve the Eq. (21) numerically for the three
values of the guided laser pulse waist w0 = 0.9λ (f /D = 1), w0 = 1.35λ (f /D = 1.5), and w0 = 1.8λ (f /D = 2) (Fig.
3c). Such interaction conﬁguration leads to a signiﬁcant enhancement of the maximum attainable ion energy, which
is now limited by the group velocity of the laser in the guiding structure instead of being limited by the increasing
transparency. This enhancement can also be illustrated by the evolution of the laser ﬁeld amplitude at the foil. In
the guided case its maximum amplitude is not only higher than in the unguided case, but also the pulse becomes
phase-locked with the foil, meaning that the maximum attainable ion energy is reached.

As for the target design that would demonstrate the qualities described above, we propose to employ a composite
target, consisting of a thin foil, followed by a near critical density (NCD) slab [31]. The laser pulse will generate a
channel in the NCD plasma [22–24, 62] both in electron and ion densities. The laser will propagate in this channel
pushing the irradiated part of the foil in front of it. Though the foil density will drop due to the transverse expansion,
the NCD plasma electrons being snowplowed by the pulse would provide an opaque density spike, which being
pushed by the radiation pressure would drag the ions of the foil with it. Thus such conﬁguration is similar to the
one considered above: the laser pulse is guided with no diﬀraction and, although the density of ion decreases, the
reﬂection coeﬃcient is unity. The results of the computer simulations of such target conﬁguration, reported in Ref.
[31], show the signiﬁcant enhancement of the maximum ion energy in the case of a composite target compared to the
case of a single foil target.

V. OFF-NORMAL INCIDENCE

In this section we consider the acceleration of a thin solid density foil by the oﬀ-normal incidence laser pulse in the
RPA regime. The laser wave vector has an angle, θ, with target normal. Consider two Lorentz transformations to
the reference frame where the foil is at rest and the wave is normally incident on the foil. The ﬁrst transformation is
a boost along the x-axis to the reference frame moving with the velocity β. The transformation matrix is

The second transformation is a boost along the y-axis to eliminate the x component of the ﬁeld:

After the ﬁrst transformation the EM wave vector is

and the angle of the laser pulse incidence on the foil becomes

cos θ′ =

(25)

Note that when β = cos θ = kx/ω the x component of the wave vector vanishes, and, in such reference frame, the EM
wave propagates parallel to the foil. After the second transformation the EM wave vector is

The condition k′′

The equation of motion for the foil, assuming |ρ| = 1, i.e. total reﬂection, and taking into account the fact that

(30)

We notice that the r.h.s. of (30) is proportional to (cos θ − β), i.e., the radiation pressure force acting on the foil
vanishes for cos θ = β and there is a fundamental limit on the maximum attainable ion energy arising from the angle
of incidence being larger than zero. The equation of motion for the foil under the action of the oblique incident EM
wave with βg < 1 is

dβ
dt

= κp1 − β2(βg cos θ − β)[(βg cos θ − β)2 + (1 − β2)(1 − β2

.

(31)

The r.h.s. of this equation is proportional to (βg cos θ − β), i.e., βmax = βg cos θ. We see that the two limitations
(group velocity and angle of incidence) are combined in a single limit for the maximum ion energy. In Fig. 5 we
present the results of the numerical solution of the equation of motion in two cases: (i) RPA and (ii) RPA with both
oblique incidence and ﬁnite group velocity. These two curves demonstrate a behavior similar to the one described in
section 3: the PRA case leads to unconstrained energy growth, while the RPA with both oblique incidence and ﬁnite
group velocity shows the existence of the maximum attainable ion energy.

In order to characterize the asymptotic behavior of the foil velocity Eq. (30) is solved in quadratures:

Thus the solution of Eq. (30) in the limit t → ∞ demonstrate a power law dependence as β → βmax.

The maximum velocity in this case is determined by the combination of the laser pulse group velocity and the angle
of incidence, βmax = βg cos θ. The solution of Eq. (31) in the limit t → ∞ demonstrate the exponential dependence
as the value of the foil velocity approaches its maximum.

hydrogen and has a thickness of 0.25λ. (b) The characteristic spectra of protons for Gaussian and super-Gaussian pulses. (c)
The distribution of the number of protons in the (angle, energy) plane for a 13 J laser pulse interacting with a ne = 400ncr

The oﬀ-normal incidence equation of motion can be applied for the characterization of the RPA of deformed targets.
In this case the target can be considered as a collection of unit surface elements each of those having its own angle
between the target normal and local EM wave vector. Such picture can be used for the self-consistent description of the

13

target deformation and expansion during the RPA. In order to show the necessity of such approach, let us consider a
naive model of the proton energy distribution. We assume that the energy of protons depends on transverse coordinate
the same way as the laser pulse intensity, E = Emax exp (−2rα/wα), where Emax is the maximum proton energy, which
is achieved on axis. Here α = 2 stands for a Gaussian pulse and α = 4, 6, 8... stands for a super-Gaussian pulse.
Using this distribution and assuming a homogenous distribution of protons in the transverse direction, we can plot
the spectra of protons in the Gaussian and super-Gaussian cases (see Fig. 5b). This model results in the prediction
that the super-Gaussian pulses should produce proton beams with the monoenergetic feature at high energies, while
the Gaussian pulses lead to the exponentially decaying spectra of protons. However, if we compare this prediction
to the results of computer simulations (see Fig. 5c) of a super-Gaussian pulse interaction with a thin foil, we see no
enhancement of the number of protons at high energies. Moreover, the transverse distribution of proton energy does
not follow the super-Gaussian proﬁle of the laser pulse intensity. This observation is likely due to the deformation of
the target in the course of the interaction and the resulting eﬀects of oﬀ-normal incidence. Further investigation of
such interaction will be reported elsewhere.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we studied the factors that limit the eﬀectiveness of radiation pressure acceleration. The RPA regime
is very attractive for applications due to its high eﬀectiveness, however this eﬀectiveness can be reduced by a number of
factors. We identiﬁed (i) target transparency that leads to a reduced coupling of the laser pulse to the target and thus
reduced maximum ion energy, (ii) ﬁnite group velocity, which imposes a fundamental limit on the maximum attainable
ion energy, (iii) transverse expansion, which leads to increased target transparency and thus reduced maximum ion
energy, and (iv) oﬀ-normal incidence, which imposes limit on maximum attainable ion energy, determined by the angle
of incidence. Though some of these factors lead to severe limits on the maximum attainable ion energy, we showed
that laser pulse tailoring, or special target design, may compensate these limits, enabling the laser acceleration of
high-energy ions.

The target transparency plays a crucial role in the ion acceleration, especially in the case of RPA. If the target
is transparent for radiation, then most of the laser pulse is transmitted through the target without aﬀecting it. In
the opposite case of the target being opaque, this opaqueness is maintained by a large number of ions. Thus the
energy gain of an individual ion, which is equal to laser pulse energy divided by the number of accelerated ions in
the most favorable case, is suppressed. It is well established that the ion acceleration is most eﬀective at a0 = εp,
i.e., at the threshold of target transparency. This relation is easily understood. The pulse can push the foil without
going through, and this opacity is maintained by a minimum possible number of ions, increasing the individual ion
energy gain. We established the relation between a0 and εp, taking into account relativistic eﬀects, a0 = γεp, which
gives guidance to what laser-target parameters should be used to maximize the ion energy gain. This condition also
enables one to optimize the ion acceleration by reducing the acceleration length. Optimization is achieved by choosing
the laser pulse proﬁle in such a way that this condition is satisﬁed at every instant in time during the acceleration
process. We illustrated the fact that such a laser proﬁle can be obtained both analytically and numerically.

The laser pulse group velocity being smaller than the vacuum light speed, imposes a fundamental limit on the
maximum attainable ion velocity (less than the laser group velocity). This limit is connected with the fact that in the
rest frame of the target moving with the velocity equal to the group velocity of the EM wave the wavevector vanishes
and so does the radiation pressure. The group velocity eﬀects will manifest themselves in the case of tightly focused
laser pulses, which are usually employed to reach the RPA regime. Also if the laser pulse prior to interacting with a
foil, has to penetrate through the pre-plasma, created by the pre-pulse, it would aﬀect the value of its group velocity.
Several schemes of RPA realization involve guiding the laser pulse through some pre-formed channel to the target. In
this case the group velocity of the laser will be determined by the properties of the guiding structure. Though the
current level of laser accelerated ion energies is too low to observe the eﬀect of group velocity, the next generation
laser facilities, delivering pulses of PW and multi-PW levels and able to generate hundreds MeV or even GeV ion
beams, will be able to probe the group velocity dependence of the maximum ion energy.

Above the RPA regime is usually realized with tightly focused laser pulses to reach high intensity and ultra-thin
foils to maximize energy gain per ion. However in the case of such laser pulse interaction with such foils, the ﬁnite
spot size eﬀects begin to manifest themselves limiting the maximum attainable ion energy. These eﬀects are due to
the deformation of the foil caused by the transverse intensity proﬁle of a laser pulse, and It results in the stretching of
the irradiated spot as it is being pushed by the pulse. Consequently the area density of this spot decreases to the point
when it becomes transparent to the laser. At this point the acceleration is eﬀectively terminated. We showed that
typically the transverse expansion dominates over the group velocity, severely limiting the maximum attainable ion
energy. Of course the point of termination depends on the radius of the laser focal spot. The larger is the radius the
smaller is the transverse expansion. However the maximum ion energy depends on the laser intensity - the larger is

14

the intensity, the higher is the ion energy. Thus for a given laser energy and foil there should be an optimal focal spot
radius that maximizes ion energy. Apart from this optimization it is possible to enhance the accelerated ion energy
by modifying the target. The modiﬁcation should preserve the surface density of the foil throughout the acceleration
process. We proposed to employ an external guiding, which is realized through the utilization of a composite target
consisting of a foil with a near critical density (NCD) slab attached to the foil back side. In the case of such a target
the laser will accelerate an irradiated spot of the foil through the NCD plasma. While propagating in the NCD
plasma the pulse will generate a channel in electron and ion density, analogous to the case of the MVA regime of
ion acceleration. Though the foil density will drop due to the transverse expansion, the NCD plasma electrons being
snowplowed by the pulse would provide an opaque density spike that, being pushed by the radiation pressure, drag
the ions of the foil with it. Thus the laser pulse will be guided without the intensity loss due to diﬀraction, and the
accelerated foil will stay opaque. The ﬁnal ion energy will be determined by the group velocity of the laser in the
NCD plasma.

In many cases the laser ion acceleration experiments are carried out with the laser incident on a foil at some angle
to the normal to the target surface. It is usually done to avoid the backreﬂection of the laser light into the system
and consequent damage of it. Some mechanisms of ion acceleration demonstrate the dependence of the acceleration
process on the angle of incidence, and this motivates the study of oﬀ-normal incidence eﬀects in the case of the RPA.
We found that the maximum attainable ion velocity is equal to βg cos θ. Thus the oﬀ-normal incidence modiﬁes the
group velocity limit. As one can see the eﬀect of the oﬀ-normal incidence in the case of the RPA is quite strong and
should manifest itself in future experiments at PW-class laser facilities.

Our analytical results on the oﬀ-normal incidence in the RPA regime can also be used to characterize the acceleration
of a foil being deformed by the radiation pressure. We brieﬂy discussed that, as acceleration evolves, the foil transforms
from a ﬂat surface to a curved surface surrounding the laser pulse. Then the radiation pressure exerted on each surface
element can be characterized by its own angle of incidence, i.e., the angle between local normal to the surface and local
direction of the wavevector. Thus the farther is the surface element from the laser central axis the more the radiation
pressure is suppressed by the factor cos θ. We used this to explain the discrepancy between a simple analytical model,
which predicts the ion spectrum assuming the ion energy distribution follows the laser intensity transverse proﬁle, and
the results of PIC simulations. Whereas the simple model predicts a peak in the high energy part of the spectrum,
there is none to be found in the PIC results. It is due to the suppression of the radiation pressure by the cosine of
the local angle of incidence.

In conclusion we make a remark of general character concerning the maximum-maximorum ion energy achievable in a
terrestrial environment. It is well known, each new generation of accelerators aimed at basic research is characterized
by parameters greatly exceeding the ones of the previous generation. However, ultimately, there are questions of
the accelerator size and cost. Regarding the question of the maximum achievable size (and the maximum energy
of charged particles), Enrico Fermi pointed out in his speech “What can we learn with high energy accelerators?”
delivered on January 29, 1954 that the maximum energy would be approximately 1015 eV for an accelerator length
equal to the circumference of Earth’s equator (40,075 km), which is equal to the maximal accelerator size on Earth
[66]. This follows from the requirement that the amplitude of the accelerating electric ﬁeld in a standard accelerator
≈ 100 MeV/m does not cause a vacuum breakdown. Such the hypothetical accelerator is called the “Fermitron” or
“Globatron”, although E. Fermi named his concept as an “Ultimate Accelerator”. In the case of the RPA regime, the
ion ﬁnal energy Eion = mic2γion and the laser pulse length llas = NC λ (here we have expressed the laser length via
the laser wavelength and the number of cycles in the pulse, Nc) are related to the acceleration length lacc as

lacc = 2γ 2

ionllas,

(37)

then γion ∼ placc/NC λ. For proton accelerator of the size about lacc = 4 × 109 cm, for the laser pulse length
λNC = 10 × 10−4 cm, where λ = 1 µm, the maximum achievable energy is 5 × 1015 eV, which is the same order
of magnitude as the energy gain in the Fermitron, the conventional accelerator going around the Earth equator.
This is due to the fact that the ion energy provided by (linear) conventional accelerators is linearly proportional to
the accelerator length, while the ion energy from laser accelerators scales as a square root of the accelerator length,
illustrated in Fig. 6. For the accelerator length smaller than the Earth equator circumference the laser acceleration
has a potential to provide higher energy of accelerated ions. There is an apparent way to achieve larger RPA
accelerated ions by shortening the laser pulse length via decreasing the number of cycles per pulse or/and decreasing
the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation.
