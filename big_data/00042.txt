ABSTRACT

Decadal-long radial velocity surveys have recently started to discover analogs to the most inﬂuential
planet of our solar system, Jupiter. Detecting and characterizing these worlds is expected to shape our
understanding of our uniqueness in the cosmos. Despite the great successes of recent transit surveys,
Jupiter analogs represent a terra incognita, owing to the strong intrinsic bias of this method against
long orbital periods. We here report on the ﬁrst validated transiting Jupiter analog, Kepler-167e (KOI-
490.02), discovered using Kepler archival photometry orbiting the K4-dwarf KIC-3239945. With a
radius of (0.91 ± 0.02) RJ, a low orbital eccentricity (0.06+0.10−0.04) and an equilibrium temperature of
(131± 3) K, Kepler-167e bears many of the basic hallmarks of Jupiter. Kepler-167e is accompanied by
three Super-Earths on compact orbits, which we also validate, leaving a large cavity of transiting worlds
around the habitable-zone. With two transits and continuous photometric coverage, we are able to
uniquely and precisely measure the orbital period of this post snow-line planet (1071.2323± 0.0006 d),
paving the way for follow-up of this K = 11.8 mag target.

INTRODUCTION

Jupiter is the dominant member of our planetary sys-
tem with a mass exceeding twice that of all the other
planets combined. Theories of the formation and evolu-
tion of our neighboring planets are usually conditioned
upon the properties and location of our system’s gargan-
tuan world (see, e.g. Walsh et al. 2011), yet exoplanetary
surveys have only recently begun to assess the prevalence
of such objects (see, e.g. Gould et al. 2010).

Jupiter’s presiding mass led to it playing a critical role
in the dynamical evolution of the early Solar System
(Morbidelli, et al. 2007). The ﬁnal architecture of our
solar system, including the Earth, is thus intimately con-
nected to the existence and dynamical history of Jupiter
(Batygin & Laughlin 2015). The mass, location and exis-
tence of Jupiter also likely aﬀect the impact rate of minor
bodies onto the Earth (Horner et al. 2010), thereby in-
ﬂuencing the evolution of terrestrial life. The search for
Jupiter analogs has therefore emerged as a scientiﬁc pri-
ority, linked to the fundamental goal of understanding
our uniqueness in the cosmos.

Around 20 extrasolar Jupiter analogs have been dis-
covered with the radial velocity method (see Table 4 of
Rowan et al. 2015), indicating that these cool worlds are
not unique to the Solar System. Occurrence rate esti-
mates, including constraints from microlensing surveys,
(cid:39) 3% (Cumming et al. 2008;
Gould et al. 2010; Wittenmyer et al. 2011; Rowan et al.
2015) (depending upon the deﬁnition of an “analog”),

typically converge at η(cid:88)

mately equal to the prevalance of Earth analogs orbit-
ing FGK stars as measured using the Kepler transit sur-
vey, speciﬁcally η⊕ = 1.7+2.6−1.0% (Petigura et al. 2013;
Foreman-Mackey et al. 2014) (periods of 200–400 days;
0.5–1.5 R⊕), although again with the caveat depending
upon how one deﬁnes “analogous”.

The transit method has dominated the exoplanet de-
tection game over the last decade. This technique has
demonstrated a sensitivity to planets ranging from sub-
Earths (Barclay et al. 2013) to super-Jupiters (Fortney
et al. 2011) orbiting a diverse array of stars, such as M-
dwarfs (Dressing & Charbonneau 2015), giants (Quinn
et al. 2015) and even binaries (Doyle et al. 2011). From
2010-2015, the number of conﬁrmed/validated exoplan-
ets discovered via the transit method is seven-fold that of
all other exoplanet hunting methods combined. One of
the last regions of parameter-space which has been stub-
bornly resistant to the reign of transits are those planets
found beyond the snow-line, owing to their long orbital
periods. Indeed, whilst ∼ 20 Jupiter analogs have been
found with radial velocities (Rowan et al. 2015), no tran-
siting examples have been previously announced.

Jupiter analogs have both a reduced geometric tran-
sit probability and a lower chance of being observed to
transit within a ﬁxed observing window less than twice
the planet’s orbital period (which is usually the case). In
general, one expects the planey yield of a transit survey
to scale as P −5/3 (Beatty & Gaudi 2008), implying that
a 3 day period Jupiter is ∼16,000 times easier to ﬁnd
than the same planet at 1000 days. Nevertheless, in a
large transit survey spanning multiple years, such as Ke-
pler (∼200,000 stars over ∼4 years), these obstacles are
expected to yield and Kepler should expect detections if
the occurrence rate is (cid:38) O[10−2].

Pursuing this possibility, we here report the dis-

2

Kipping et al.

covery of a 1071 day period transiting planet, Kepler-
167e (formeley KOI-490.02), orbiting the K-dwarf KIC-
3239945 (see Table 1) with a size and insolation com-
parable to Jupiter. This planet, which lies comfortably
beyond the snow-line, is found to transit twice over the
duration of the Kepler mission allowing for a precise de-
termination of the orbital period and making it schedu-
lable for future follow-up work. The data processing and
follow-up observations required for this discovery are dis-
cussed in § 2 &§ 3 respectively. In § 4, we discuss how we
are able to validate Kepler-167e and the other three tran-
siting candidates (KOI-490.01, .03 & .04; P ∼ 4.4, 7.4 &
21.8 d) within the system using BLENDER. Light curve ﬁts,
leveraging asterodensity proﬁling, are discussed in § 5,
allowing us to infer the radius and even eccentricity of
Kepler-167e. Finally, we place this discovery in context
in § 6, discussing the system architecture and prospects
for follow-up.

2. KEPLER PHOTOMETRY

2.1. Data Acquisition

We downloaded the publicly available Kepler data for
KOI-490 from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes
(MAST). The downloaded data were released as part of
Data Release 24 and were processed using Science Opera-
tions Center (SOC) Pipeline version 9.2.24. All quarters
from 1-17 were available in long-cadence (LC) and from
9-17 there was also short-cadence (SC), which was used
preferentially over LC.

2.2. Data Selection

To ﬁt light curve models to the Kepler data, it is neces-
sary to ﬁrst remove instrumental and stellar photomet-
ric variability which can distort the transit light curve
shape. We break this process up into two stages: (i) pre-
detrending cleaning (ii) long-term detrending. In what
follows, each quarter is detrended independently.

2.3. Pre-detrending Cleaning

The ﬁrst step is to visually inspect each quarter and
remove any exponential ramps, ﬂare-like behaviors and
instrumental discontinuities in the data. We make no at-
tempt to correct these artifacts and simply exclude them
from the photometry manually.

We inspect all points occurring outside of a transit for
In-transit points are deﬁned as those occur-
outliers.
ring within ±0.6 transit durations of the nominal lin-
ear ephemeris for each KOI. For these durations and
ephemerides, we adopt the NASA Exoplanet Archive
Akeson et al. (2013) parameters. We then clean the
out-of-transit Simple Aperture Photometry (SAP) light
curve of 3 σ outliers, identiﬁed using a moving median
smoothing curve with a 20-point window.

2.4. Detrending with CoFiAM

For the data used in the transit light curve ﬁts in §5,
it is also necessary to remove the remaining long-term
trends in the time series. These trends can be due to
instrumental eﬀects, such as focus drift, or stellar ef-
fects, such as rotational modulations. For this task, data
are detrended using the Cosine Filtering with Autocor-
relation Minimization (CoFiAM) algorithm. CoFiAM was
speciﬁcally developed to protect the shape of a transit

light curve and we direct the reader to our previous work
(Kipping et al. 2013) for a detailed description.

Each transit of each KOI is detrended independently
using CoFiAM, setting the protected timescale to twice the
associated transit duration. After detrending, the light
curves were ﬁtted with the same light curve model and
algorithm described later in §5. The maximum likelihood
duration and ephemeris were saved from these ﬁts. We
then used these values to go back to §2.3 and repeat the
entire detrending process, to ensure we used accurate
estimates of these terms.

3. FOLLOW-UP OBSERVATIONS

3.1. Spectroscopy

KOI-490 was observed on 2011 October 16 at the
Keck I telescope on Mauna Kea (HI) with the HIRES
spectrometer (Vogt et al. 1994), in order to help charac-
terize the star as described below in § 3.4. The exposure
time was 30 minutes and the spectrograph slit was set
using the C2 decker (0.(cid:48)(cid:48)86 × 14(cid:48)(cid:48)). Reductions were per-
formed with the standard procedures employed by the
California Planet Search (Howard et al. 2010; Johnson et
al. 2010). This resulted in an extracted spectrum with
R ∼ 60, 000 covering the approximate wavelength range
360–800 nm, with a signal-to-noise ratio of 90 per resolu-
tion element in the region of the Mg I b triplet (519 nm).
We examined the spectrum for signs of absorption lines
from another star that might be causing the transit sig-
nal, if located within the slit. This was done by ﬁrst
subtracting a spectrum closely matching that of the tar-
get star (after proper wavelength shifting and continuum
normalization), and then inspecting the residuals (see
Kolbl et al. 2015). We saw no evidence of secondary
spectral lines.
In order to quantify our sensitivity to
such companions we performed numerical simulations in
which we subjected the residuals to a similar ﬁtting pro-
cess by injecting mock companions over a range of tem-
peratures from 3500 to 6000 K, and with a broad range in
relative velocities. We then attempted to recover them,
and this allowed us to estimate that we are sensitive to
companions down to about 1% of the ﬂux of the primary
star, with velocity separations greater than 10 km s−1.
For smaller relative velocities the secondary lines would
be blended with those of the primary and would not be
detected. This spectroscopic constraint is used below for
the validation of the candidates in § 4.

3.2. High-resolution Imaging

Images from the J-band UK Infrared Telescope survey
(UKIRT; Lawrence et al. 2007) available on the Kepler
Community Follow-up Observing Program (CFOP) Web
site6 show a nearby companion about ﬁve magnitudes
fainter than KOI-490 at an angular separation of 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)1 in
position angle 62.◦7, which falls within the photometric
aperture of Kepler. Ancillary information for this source
based on automatic image classiﬁcation indicates a prob-
ability of 99.4% that it is a galaxy, 0.3% that it is a star,
and 0.3% that it is noise, though it is unclear how robust
these assessments are. The UKIRT images have a typical
seeing-limited resolution of about 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)8 or 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)9. Additional
imaging eﬀorts reported on CFOP include speckle inter-
ferometry observations on the WIYN 3.5m telescope at

692 nm and 880 nm (see Horch et al. 2014; Everett et al.
2015), lucky imaging observations on the Calar Alto 2m
telescope at 766 nm (Lillo-Box et al. 2012), and imaging
with the Robo-AO system on the Palomar 1.5m telescope
approximately in the R band (Law et al. 2014), none of
which detected this companion likely due to its faintness
at the optical wavelengths probed by these observations.
To investigate this detection further and to explore
the inner regions around the target, we observed KOI-
490 with near-infrared adaptive optics (AO) using the
1024 × 1024 NIRC2 imager (Wizinowich et al. 2004; Jo-
hansson et al. 2008) on the Keck II, 10m telescope on the
night of 2014 June 12. We used the natural guide star
system, as the target star was bright enough to be used as
the guide star. The data were acquired using the narrow-
band Br-γ ﬁlter and the narrow camera ﬁeld of view with
a pixel scale of 9.942 mas pixel−1. The Br-γ ﬁlter has a
narrower bandwidth (2.13–2.18 µm), but a similar cen-
tral wavelength (2.15 µm) compared the 2MASS Ks ﬁlter
(1.95–2.34 µm; 2.15 µm) and allows for longer integra-
tion times before saturation. A 3-point dither pattern
was utilized to avoid the noisier lower left quadrant of
the NIRC2 array. The 3-point dither pattern was ob-
served three times with two coadds per dither position
for a total of 18 frames; each frame had an exposure
time of 30 s, yielding a total on-source exposure time of
3 × 3 × 2 × 30 s = 540 s. The target star was measured
with a resolution of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)051 (FWHM).
The object 2(cid:48)(cid:48) to the NE of KOI-490 seen in the UKIRT
images was clearly detected in the NIRC2 data (see Fig-
ure 1), and no other stars were detected within 10(cid:48)(cid:48). The
image of the companion appears stellar, so we consider it
a star in the following. In the Br-γ passband the data are
sensitive to companions that have a K-band contrast of
∆K = 3.8 mag at a separation of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)1 and ∆K = 8.8 mag
at 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)5 from the central star. We estimated the sensi-
tivities by injecting fake sources with a signal-to-noise
ratio of 5 into the ﬁnal combined images at distances
of N × FWHM from the central source, where N is an
integer.
We also observed KOI-490 in the J-band (1.248 µm)
with NIRC2 in order to obtain the J − K color of the
companion star. The J-band observations employed
the same 3-point dither pattern with an integration
time of 10 s per coadd for a total on-source integration
time of 180 s. These data had slightly better resolution
(0.(cid:48)(cid:48)046) and a sensitivity of ∆J = 4.4 mag at 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)1 and
∆J = 7.4 mag at 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)5. Full sensitivity curves in both
J and Br-γ are shown in Figure 1. The companion
star was found to be fainter than the primary star by
∆J = 3.84 ± 0.03 mag and ∆K = 3.51 ± 0.01 mag,
and separated from the primary by ∆α = 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)97 ± 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)01
and ∆δ = 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)00 ± 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)01 in right ascension and dec-
lination (corresponding to an angular separation of
2.(cid:48)(cid:48)21 in position angle 63.◦1). After deblending the
2MASS photometry we ﬁnd that the primary has J-
and K-band magnitudes of J1 = 12.47 ± 0.02 mag
and K1 = 11.87 ± 0.02 mag, and the secondary has
J2 = 16.32 ± 0.04 mag and K2 = 15.38 ± 0.02 mag.
The companion is a redder star than the primary:
the individual colors are (J − K)1 = 0.60 ± 0.03 and
(J − K)2 = 0.94 ± 0.04.

with the sensitivity curves in the J (1.248 µm) and Br-γ (2.15 µm)
bands.

3.3. Centroid motion analysis

The very precise astrometry that can be obtained from
the Kepler images enables a search for false positives that
may be causing one or more of the signals in KOI-490,
such as a background eclipsing binary. This can be done
by measuring the location of the transit signals relative
to the target by means of diﬀerence images, formed by
subtracting an average of in-transit pixel values from out-
of-transit pixel values. If a transit signal is caused by a
stellar source, then the diﬀerence image will show that
stellar source, and its location can be determined by pixel
response function centroiding (Bryson et al. 2013). The
centroid of an average out-of-transit image provides the
location of KOI-490 because the object is well isolated.
The centroid of the diﬀerence image is then compared
to that of the out-of-transit image, which provides the
location of the transit source relative to KOI-490.

The automatic pipeline processing of Kepler provides
these oﬀsets for each quarter in the Data Validation Re-
ports, which are available through the CFOP Web site.
For KOI-490.01 and KOI-490.03 the multi-quarter av-
erages of the oﬀsets indicate a position for the source
of the transits that is consistent with the location of
target. Based on the 1σ uncertainties associated with
those multi-quarter average oﬀsets we adopted 3σ radii
of confusion for these two candidates of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)396 and 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)603,
respectively, within which the centroid motion analy-
sis is insensitive to the presence of contaminating stars.
As these limits are smaller than the separation of the
2.(cid:48)(cid:48)2 companion reported earlier, that star cannot be the
source of these transits.

For KOI-490.02 and KOI-490.04 the automatic ﬁts per-
formed by the Kepler pipeline failed, as indicated in the
Data Validation Reports, so no centroid information is
available for these candidates.

3.4. Stellar properties

The spectroscopic properties of KOI-490 were deter-
mined from an analysis of our Keck/HIRES spectrum.
Our analysis was performed using the Stellar Parame-
ter Classiﬁcation (SPC) pipeline (Buchhave et al. 2012),
which cross-correlates the observed spectrum against a
large library of calculated spectra based on model atmo-
spheres by R. L. Kurucz, and assigns stellar properties

interpolating amongst those of the synthetic spectra pro-
viding the best match. This analysis gave Teﬀ = (4890±
50) K, log g = (4.61 ± 0.10), [Fe/H] = (−0.03 ± 0.08),
and v sin i < 2 km s−1. The measured radial velocity
is (−29.3 ± 1.0) km s−1, and the eﬀective temperature
corresponds to a spectral type of K3 or K4.

The mass and radius of the star, along with other prop-
erties, were estimated by comparing the SPC parameters
against a grid of Dartmouth isochrones (Dotter et al.
2008) with a χ2 procedure similar to that described by
Torres et al. (2008). Because the stellar radius and age
are largely determined by the surface gravity, and our
log g determination provides a relatively weak constraint
for KOI-490 given its uncertainty, we supplemented it
with an estimate of the mean stellar density obtained
by ﬁtting the Kepler light curves of KOI-490.01, KOI-
490.03, and KOI-490.04, on the assumption that they
are true planets (justiﬁed below) and that they orbit the
same star. The stellar parameters derived in this way
are listed in Table 1, along with the inputs from SPC
and the photometric mean density (posteriors shown in
Figure 13). The inferred distance is based on the appar-
ent Ks-band magnitude from 2MASS and a reddening
estimate of E(B − V ) = (0.075 ± 0.030) from the Kepler
Input Catalog (KIC; Brown et al. 2011).
Given these properties for KOI-490, we investigated
whether the measured brightness and color of the 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)2
neighbor reported earlier are consistent with those ex-
pected for a physically associated main-sequence star of
later spectral type, i.e., one falling on the same Dart-
mouth isochrone as the primary. We ﬁnd that an M4 or
M5 dwarf with a mass around 0.20–0.21 M(cid:12) would have
approximately the right brightness compared to the pri-
mary, though its J − K color would be about 0.16 mag
bluer than we measure. However, given the uncertainties
that may be expected in the theoretical ﬂux predictions
for cool stars (based here on PHOENIX model atmo-
spheres implemented in the Dartmouth models), as well
as variations in color that may occur in real stars due,
e.g., to chromospheric activity, we consider the measured
properties to be still consistent with a bound companion,
although a chance alignment cannot be ruled out.

4. STATISTICAL VALIDATION

Transiting planet candidates require extra care to show
that the periodic dips in stellar brightness are not as-
trophysical false positives, caused by other phenomena
such as an eclipsing binary blended with the target (a
“blend”). Because KOI-490 is a faint star (V ≈ 14.3),
it is challenging to conﬁrm the planetary nature any of
the candidates in this system dynamically, by measuring
the Doppler shifts they induce on the host star. The al-
ternative is to validate them statistically, showing that
the likelihood of a true planet is far greater than that
of a false positive. Rowe et al. (2014) followed this ap-
proach and reported the validation of two of the can-
didates, KOI-490.01 and KOI-490.03, based on the ar-
gument that most candidates in multiple systems can
be shown statistically to have a very high chance of be-
ing true planets (Lissauer et al. 2012, 2014). These two
planets received the oﬃcial designations Kepler-167b and
Kepler-167c. The validations relied in part on an exami-
nation of existing follow-up observations including spec-
troscopy and high-resolution imaging, and on an anal-
ysis of the ﬂux centroids. The other two candidates in
the system, KOI-490.02 and KOI-490.04, were not con-
sidered validated by Rowe et al. (2014) because the cen-
troid information available was insuﬃcient to determine
whether the source of the photometric signals coincided
with the location of the target, within errors. Addition-
ally, the period of KOI-490.02 was not precisely known,
since only one transit had occurred in the data at their
disposal (Q1–Q10).

After the publication of the Rowe et al. (2014) work,
AO imaging of KOI-490 was obtained that showed the
presence of a 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)2 companion that was unknown at the
time (see § 3.2), and could possibly be the source of one of
the signals. However, as pointed out earlier, the reﬁned
centroid information now available that includes Kepler
observations from Q1–Q17 ﬁrmly rules out that the com-
panion is causing the transits in KOI-490.01 and KOI-
490.03, as it is well beyond the 3 σ exclusion regions for
these candidates (0.(cid:48)(cid:48)396 and 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)603, respectively; § 3.3).
Thus, the validations of Rowe et al. (2014) stand.

We describe below our eﬀorts to validate the other two
candidates, KOI-490.02 (the snow-line candidate) and
KOI-490.04, using the BLENDER technique (Torres et al.
2004, 2011; Fressin et al. 2012). This procedure has been
applied successfully to the validation of many other tran-
sit candidates from Kepler (for recent examples see, e.g.,
Meibom et al. 2013; Ballard et al. 2013; Kipping et al.
2014; Torres et al. 2015; Jenkins et al. 2015). BLENDER
addresses the possibility that the signals originate in an
unseen background/foreground eclipsing binary (BEB)
along the line of sight, a background or foreground star
transited by a larger planet (BP scenario), or a stellar
companion physically associated with the target that is
in turn transited by another star or by a planet. These
types of blends are usually the most diﬃcult to rule out.
The companions in the last two cases are usually close
enough to the target as to be spatially unresolved. We
refer to those hierarchical triple conﬁgurations as HTS
or HTP, respectively, depending on the nature of the
eclipsing object (star or planet). Other types of false
positives that do not involve contamination by another
object along the line of sight include grazing eclipsing bi-

naries, and transits of a small star in front of a giant star.
However, these cases can be easily ruled out as their sig-
nals would be inconsistent with the observed durations
of transit ingress and egress for the two candidates.

Our validations with BLENDER follow closely the pro-
cedure described by Kipping et al. (2014) or Torres et
al. (2015); the reader is referred to these sources for de-
tails of the methodology. In essence, BLENDER uses the
shape of a transit light curve to rule out blend scenar-
ios that would lead to the wrong shape for a transit.
Large numbers of false positives of diﬀerent kinds are
simulated, and the synthetic light curves are then com-
pared with the Kepler observations in a χ2 sense. Blends
giving poor ﬁts to the real data are considered to be
excluded, and the ensemble of results places tight con-
straints on the detailed properties of viable blends in-
cluding the sizes or masses of the objects involved, their
brightness and colors, the linear distance between the
background/foreground eclipsing pair and the KOI, and
even the eccentricities of the orbits.

4.1. KOI-490.02, a Snow-line Candidate

Our simulations with BLENDER rule out background
eclipsing binaries as the source of the signal. This is
illustrated in Figure 2 (left panel), where we show the χ2
landscape in a representative cross-section of parameter
space. The diagram shows the linear separation between
the BEB and the target as a function of the mass of the
primary star in the BEB. The only scenarios of this kind
that provide acceptable ﬁts to the Kepler light curve are
those in which the main star of the binary is about twice
as massive as KOI-490 (i.e., M ∼ 1.4 M(cid:12)). These false
positives occupy a narrow vertical strip on the lower right
corner of the ﬁrst panel in the ﬁgure (darker region con-
tained within the white, 3σ contour). However, all of
these conﬁgurations result in a combined r − Ks color
index for the blend that is much bluer than the mea-
sured value for KOI-490 (r − Ks = 2.095 ± 0.027)7, as
indicated by the hatched blue region in the ﬁgure within
which all blends have the wrong color. Furthermore, in
these false positive conﬁgurations with F-type primaries
the BEB is brighter than the target itself (see dashed
green line). This conﬂicts with our spectroscopic classiﬁ-
cation of KOI-490 as an early K dwarf. We conclude that
BEBs cannot mimic the transits of KOI-490.02 and si-
multaneously satisfy all observational constraints. This
also rules out the 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)2 companion as the source of the
transits.

Blends involving background or foreground stars tran-
sited by a larger planet (BP scenario) are more easily
able to match the transit shape and depth. This is
shown in the middle panel of Figure 2, in which the per-
mitted region is larger and accommodates chance align-
ments with stars between about 0.25 M(cid:12) and 1.0 M(cid:12).
The spectroscopic constraint represented by the hatched
green area excludes all such blends if the intruding stars
have ∆Kp < 5 mag and fall within the spectrometer
slit (unless their spectral lines are blended with those
of the target), as we would have detected them in our
Keck/HIRES observation. Most other scenarios are also
ruled out by the color constraint, but there is a narrow

tudes in the KIC, as prescribed by Pinsonneault et al. (2012).

strip of viable blends in which the contaminating star
has the same color (mass) as the target (see ﬁgure) so
that it does not alter the combined r − Ks index. These
would then be near twin stars of our target, and they
would have to be brighter than our nominal target be-
cause they are in the foreground. However, a star so
similar to our target that is transited by a planet and is
along the same line of sight but is brighter would eﬀec-
tively be our target, so we do not consider this as a false
positive.

BLENDER indicates that physical companions eclipsed
by another star (HTS scenario) invariably have the wrong
shape for the transit, or produce secondary eclipses that
are not seen in the Kepler data for KOI-490.02. Even in
cases that show only a single eclipse due to a high eccen-
tricity and a special orientation (Santerne et al. 2013) the
properties of the primary of the eclipsing binary would be
such that the overall brightness would make the binary
detectable and/or make its color inconsistent with the
measured color index of the target. These conﬁgurations
are therefore easily ruled out. Physically associated stars
transited by a larger planet (HTP scenario) can mimic
the light curve only for a very narrow range of parame-
ters, as illustrated in Figure 2, but those blends are all
too blue because the companion needs to be even more
massive than the target in order to produce the right
shape for the transit, after accounting for dilution. We
can thus exclude this category of blends completely.

In summary, our BLENDER simulations for KOI-490.02
combined with the observational constraints allow us to
easily validate the candidate as a bona ﬁde planet, rul-
ing out as the source of the transits not only unseen
background stars but also the known 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)2 companion.
A signiﬁcant factor aiding in this process is the very
high signal-to-noise ratio of the deep transits, thanks
to which the shape is so well deﬁned (particularly the
ingress/egress phases) that very few conﬁgurations in-
volving another star along the line of sight can match the
Kepler photometry as well as a true transiting planet ﬁt.

4.2. KOI-490.04

The transits of this candidate are much shallower than
those of KOI-490.02, and as a result the constraint on the
detailed shape of the light curve provided by the Kepler
data is considerably weaker. Our BLENDER simulations
indicate that false positives involving a bound companion
eclipsed by a smaller star (HTS scenario) do not provide
acceptable ﬁts to the light curve, as in the previous case.
However, not all blends corresponding to the BEB, BP,
and HTP conﬁgurations can be ruled out. We illustrate
this in Figure 3. For example, background eclipsing bi-
naries that are more than ﬁve magnitudes fainter than
the target in the Kepler band can match the shape of the
light curve just as well as a model of a planet transiting
the target, for a wide range of masses of the primary star
of the binary between 0.6 M(cid:12) and 1.4 M(cid:12) (left panel).
An even wider range of masses is permitted for back-
ground stars transited by a larger planet (BP, middle
panel). Similarly, small stars physically bound to the
target can mimic the light curve closely if transited by a
planet of suitable size (right panel, HTP). Our follow-up
observations may rule out some fraction of these blends,
but not all of them.

To compute the expected rates of occurrence of each of

Fig. 2.— Map of the χ2 surface (goodness of ﬁt) for KOI-490.02 for three diﬀerent blend scenarios, as labeled. Only blends within the
solid white contours (darker shading) provide ﬁts to the Kepler light curves that are within acceptable limits (3σ, where σ is the signiﬁcance
level of the χ2 diﬀerence compared to a transiting planet model ﬁt; see Fressin et al. 2012). Other concentric colored areas (lighter colors)
represent ﬁts that are increasingly worse (4 σ, 5 σ, etc.), which we consider to be ruled out. The hatched green areas indicate regions of
parameter space where blended stars can be excluded if they are within 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)43 of the target (half-width of the spectrometer slit), within ﬁve
magnitudes in brightness (1% relative ﬂux), and have a radial velocity diﬀering from the target by 10 km s−1 or more. In all of the above
cases they would have been detected spectroscopically. Blends in the hatched blue areas can also be ruled out because they would be either
too red (left) or too blue (right) compared to the measured r− Ks color of KOI-490, by more than three times the measurement uncertainty.
Left: BEB scenario. The vertical axis represents the linear distance between the eclipsing binary and the target (DBEB − Dtarg), cast for
convenience in terms of the distance modulus diﬀerence ∆δ = 5 log(DBEB/Dtarg). The dashed green line shown for reference is the locus
of blends of equal apparent Kp brightness as the target. Middle: BP scenarios. As before, only blends that are brighter than the target
(below the dashed green line) are able to mimic the light curve. The r − Ks color constraint rules out most of those. Right: HTP scenario.
The vertical axis now shows the size of the planet transiting the companion star, in units of Jupiter’s radius. All blends of this kind that
provide acceptable ﬁts to the light curve are too blue, and are therefore ruled out.

Fig. 3.— Similar to Figure 2 for KOI-490.04, using the same color scheme. For this candidate all three scenarios feature blends that
cannot be ruled out from the shape of the transits or constraints from our follow-up observations (darker areas not overlapping the hatched
regions). The expected frequencies of each of these types of blends are estimated in the text.

these scenarios we followed the Monte Carlo procedure
described by Torres et al. (2015), in which we simulated
large numbers of blends and counted those that satisfy
the constraints from BLENDER and the follow-up obser-
vations. The technique relies on the number densities
of stars in the vicinity of KOI-490 (at Galactic latitude
+9.◦4), the estimated rates of occurrence of eclipsing bi-
naries and transiting planets of various sizes and orbital
periods, and other known properties of binary stars such
as the distributions of their periods, eccentricities, mass
ratios, etc. Details of these calculations may be found in
the work cited above. We obtained estimated frequencies
of 4.17 × 10−8 for the BEB scenario, 1.09 × 10−7 for BP,
and 4.10× 10−6 for HTP conﬁgurations. The total blend
frequency is the sum of these, or 4.25× 10−6. While this
value may seem small in absolute terms, the a priori rate
of occurrence of transiting planets of a given period and
size (“planet prior”, PL) is also expected to be small.
For a secure validation we require here that the “odds
ratio” PL/(BEB + BP + HTP) be large enough so that
the planet hypothesis is clearly favored over a false pos-
itive. Our estimate of the planet prior is 2.02 × 10−3,
based on the number of known KOIs of similar size and
period as the candidate. The resulting odds ratio is then

475, which corresponds to a conﬁdence level of 99.79%
that the signal is due to a bona ﬁde planet. As this ex-
ceeds the 3σ signiﬁcance threshold typically adopted in
BLENDER applications, it formally validates KOI-490.04
as a planet. There is, however, an important caveat to
make: an implicit assumption for BLENDER is that there is
no visible sign of a blend, whereas we know of the pres-
ence of the 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)2 companion. Our BLENDER simulations
in fact show (Figure 3) that a faint star such as this
could well be causing the signal if transited by a larger
planet, both as a physical companion to KOI-490 or as a
background/foreground interloper. Under these circum-
stances the validation with BLENDER is not suﬃcient as it
applies only to unseen sources, and we must seek alter-
nate ways of ruling out the 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)2 companion as the cause of
the transit signals. This is successfully achieved through
the use of asterodensity proﬁling, as described in §5.2.

lishes that Kepler-167b and Kepler-167c orbit the same
star, namely the target star Kepler-167, to high conﬁ-
dence.

Fitting the transit light curve of a planet includes mul-
tiple parameters pertaining to the star itself, which may
be described by the vector θ(cid:63). The vector θ(cid:63) contains
the limb darkening coeﬃcients describing the stellar in-
tensity proﬁle and the mean stellar density, ρ(cid:63). Since
Kepler-167b and Kepler-167c orbit the same star, we
can ﬁt the transit lightcurves of both simultaneously,
adopting a global θ(cid:63). By conditioning θ(cid:63) on the data
describing both planets, we obtain a higher signal-to-
noise measurement of these terms, which in turn leads
to somewhat better precision on the local parameters,
θP, describing each planet (due to the inter-parameter
covariances Carter et al. 2008).

In this work, we use the quadratic limb darkening
law with the optimal parameterization (q1 & q2) de-
scribed by Kipping (2013b). The light curves are gen-
erated with the Mandel & Agol (2002) algorithm using
30-point resampling to account for those point which are
long-cadence, as described in Kipping (2010). Quarter-
to-quarter contamination factors are accounted for, us-
ing the “CROWDSAP” header information in the raw
ﬁts ﬁles via the method described by Kipping & Tinetti
(2009). A blending factor aﬀecting all quarters due to
the 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)2 companion is also accounted for via this method.
For the global blending factor, we convert the J and
Ks colors observed in the NIRC2 AO images to a Kepler
bandpass magnitude using the ﬁfth-order polynomial re-
lation in Appendix A of Howell et al. (2012). Assum-
ing either a dwarf or a giant leads to the same result
(within the estimated uncertainty) of Kp = 19.0 ± 0.1.
Assuming Gaussian errors on the J and Ks colors from
AO and adding in quadrature an extra Gaussian uncer-
tainty reﬂecting the 0.05 magnitude error in the Howell
et al. (2012) relation, we estimate a blending factor of
log β = (−1.976 ± 0.036), where β is the ﬂux ratio be-
tween the target and the companion in the Kepler band-
pass. This is treated as a normal prior in our ﬁts and
added to the θ(cid:63) vector, since it is a term aﬀecting all of
the planets. The parameters and priors used are listed
in Table 2, with the θ(cid:63) plus two sets of θP parameters
giving a total of 12 free parameters in our model.

Fits were achieved using the multimodal nested sam-
pling algorithm MultiNest (Feroz & Hobson 2008;
Feroz et al. 2009) with 4000 live points and a target
eﬃciency set to 0.1. The eccentricities of Kepler-167b

Kepler-167 conditioned on the transits of Kepler-167b & c (green)

the posterior derived using isochrone matching of the SPC stellar

and Kepler-167c are assumed to be zero in the ﬁts.
Multi-planet Kepler systems are known to have low ec-
centricities, with Van Eylen & Albrecht (2015) ﬁnding
a Rayleigh distribution with σe = 0.049 ± 0.013 de-
scribes the overall population. Moreover, Kepler-167b
and Kepler-167c orbit the same star with orbital peri-
ods of 4.4 d and 7.4 d, placing them in close proximity
to both the star and each other. We therefore expect
these planets to be particularly likely to have near-zero
eccentricity, from a dynamical perspective.

Rather than describe the posteriors found for each pa-
rameter, we focus here on the term ρ(cid:63), since the oth-
ers will be superseded by the global ﬁts performed later.
The posterior distribution for log10(ρ(cid:63)) (it is more ap-
propriate to discuss the log since we invoked a Jeﬀreys
prior) yields log10[ρ(cid:63)(kg m−3)] = 3.446+0.034
−0.098 and is plot-
ted in Figure 4. This may be compared to the den-
sity expected by iscohrone-matching using the eﬀective
temperature, metallicity and surface gravity found using
SPC. Drawing random samples from three normal dis-
tributions describing each and ﬁnding the nearest Dart-
mouth isochrone each time, we derive a wholly indepen-
dent stellar density for Kepler-167 of log10[ρ(cid:63)(kg m−3)] =
3.455+0.015
−0.016. The close agreement between the two is fur-
ther evidence that Kepler-167b and Kepler-167c orbit the
target star, although their validation (Rowe et al. 2014)
was performed independent of this fact.

5.2. Two Fits for KOI-490.04

From the validation discussion in § 4, it was estab-
lished that KOI-490.04 does not orbit an unseen com-
panion to 3 σ conﬁdence, but may still orbit the seen 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)2
companion. Here, we perform two ﬁts to explore these
two hypotheses.

Kipping et al.

In hypothesis A (HA), we assume that KOI-490.04 or-
bits the target star, which we have established also hosts
Kepler-167b and Kepler-167c. The posterior distribution
of the light curve derived stellar density from the ﬁt in
§ 5.1 becomes the prior for the same term in this hy-
pothesis. Note that this distribution does not invoke any
information from the spectroscopic analysis. All of the
other parameters retain the same priors listed in Table 2.
Speciﬁcally, the limb darkening parameters are treated as
free again, since these were poorly constrained from the
previous ﬁt.
For HA, we relax the assumption of a circular or-
bit. Since KOI-490.04 is further from both the star and
the other two planets (P ∼ 21.8 d), higher eccentricities
are possible. In this hypothesis though, KOI-490.04 be-
longs to a typical Kepler multi-planet system and thus
we adopt the eccentricity distribution derived by Van
Eylen & Albrecht (2015); a Rayleigh distribution with
σe = 0.049. The prior for the argument of periapsis be-
comes increasingly non-uniform as eccentricity diverges
from zero, due to a geometric eﬀect (see Kipping 2014a).
Nevertheless, a uniform prior is reasonable in this case
given the low-eccentricity nature of the Van Eylen & Al-
brecht (2015) distribution.
In hypothesis B (HB), we assume that KOI-490.04 or-
bits the 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)2 companion. Here, the object can no longer
be considered to belong to a multi-planet system, since
Kepler-167b and Kepler-167c orbit a diﬀerent star now.
Therefore, the potential for high eccentricities becomes
even greater and we consider the object to follow a Beta
distribution calibrated to the population of radial veloc-
ity planets with orbital periods less than one year, as
described by Kipping (2013a) (∼ Beta[0.694, 3.252]). In
this case, the geometric bias due to the transit probabil-
ity is more signiﬁcant and requires accounting for. We
therefore use the ECCSAMPLES code described by Kip-
ping (2014a) to modify the Beta prior to a prior con-
ditioned on the fact we know this object is transiting.
However, rather than directly sampling from the prior,
we penalized the likelihood function appropriately to im-
prove computational eﬃciency. Additionally, since the
star is diﬀerent to Kepler-167, the mean stellar density
follows an uninformative Jeﬀreys prior, J [1, 109] kg m−3.
Finally, the blending prior is ﬂipped to consider the blend
source being Kepler-167.
We ﬁtted both models using MultiNest, which re-
turns the Bayesian evidence, Z, enabling Bayesian model
selection between the two. Note that this is essentially a
more advanced treatment of using the photo-blend eﬀect
(Kipping 2014b) employed in validating several candi-
dates by Torres et al. (2015). Bayesian model selection
favors hypothesis A with ∆(log Z) = (5.57±0.10). Given
that only two hypothesis exist, the statistical signiﬁcance
of hypothesis A being the preferred model is 2.9 σ. We
therefore use the photo-blend eﬀect to show that KOI-
490.04 orbits the target star to 99.6% conﬁdence.
However,
in hypothesis B, the mean stellar density
required to explain the data is log10[ρ(cid:63)(kg m−3)] =
3.49+0.16−0.28. This would make the companion star of sim-
ilar spectral type to that of Kepler-167. This essen-
tially excludes the possibility of a bound binary, since
the AO companion could not be 5 magnitudes fainter
in this case. If this were a chance alignment of a back-

of Kepler-167d, with comparison to the prior (dashed) describing
Kepler multis (Van Eylen & Albrecht 2015). The eccentricity is

Kepler-167d to the ρ(cid:63) constraint from the earlier joint ﬁt of Kepler-
167b & c.

ground star, we would still expect the host star to have
a similar color to the primary. However, J − Ks of
Kepler-167 is (0.60 ± 0.03) whereas the AO companion
has J − Ks = (0.94 ± 0.05). Reddening can not explain
such a large diﬀerence either and thus we conclude that
hypothesis B is even less likely than indicated by the
formal Bayesian evidence comparison. We therefore con-
clude that KOI-490.04 orbits Kepler-167 to a conﬁdence
exceeding 3 σ and thus may be considered a “validated”
planet, designated Kepler-167d.

Since hypothesis A invokes the posterior of ρ(cid:63) from
the earlier joint ﬁt of Kepler-167b & c as a prior, the ec-
centricity of Kepler-167d is constrained without any use
of stellar evolution or atmosphere models. This demon-
strates perhaps the ﬁrst applied example of Multibody
Asterodensity Proﬁling (MAP), proposed by Kipping et
al. (2012). However, we ﬁnd that the light curve of
Kepler-167d is of insuﬃcient data quality to provide a
meaningful improvement on the eccentricity constraint
over the prior. Speciﬁcally, in hypothesis A, the eccen-
tricity posterior closely resembles the prior (see Figure 5)
and the credible intervals on e change from 0.058+0.036
−0.029
(the prior) to 0.055+0.035

−0.027 (the posterior).

5.3. Parameters and Eccentricity of Kepler-167e

Having established that Kepler-167b, Kepler-167c and
Kepler-167d orbit the same star, we perform a new global
ﬁt adopting a common θ(cid:63) for the parent star. Since
the eccentricity of Kepler-167d is inferred to be consis-
tent with a low eccentricity prior, we assume the or-
bit is nearly circular in this global ﬁt.
Including the
third planet provides a modest improvement in the con-
straint on the mean stellar density, as expected. This
may be seen in Figure 4 where the constraint tightens

Using the new revised isochrone modeling and the

q2 = 0.17+0.18−0.10.

We now turn our attention to the outer planet, Kepler-
167e, which was validated earlier to orbit the target star
(see § 4.1). We ﬁrst veriﬁed that the period of 1071 d is
the correct one, by inspecting the raw light curve around
integer ratios of the candidate period. Given the depth
of 1.6%, even a simple visual inspection excludes this
possibility. As was done by Kipping et al. (2014), we also
veriﬁed that the shape of the two transit events observed
are consistent which is also visually evident in Figure 6.
Basic parameters derived from two independent ﬁts of
each event reveal that the events are consistent, as shown
in Table 3 (note that the ﬁrst transit is long-cadence and
the second, short).

Given that Kepler-167e is a much longer orbital period
planet than the other three, the potential for an eccen-
tric orbit is much higher both a-priori as a member of
the long-period planet sample (Kipping 2013a) and dy-
namically since it is essentially decoupled from the other
three.

We treat the posterior distribution for the mean stellar
density of the Kepler-167b, c & d joint ﬁt as a prior in
the ﬁts of planet e. Although there is a weak constraint
on the limb darkening coeﬃcients, we consider the infor-
mation too weak to be worth including and thus treat
the limb darkening coeﬃcients as independent and free.
Therefore the priors largely follow those listed in Table 2,
except for ρ(cid:63).

It is also crucial to include the orbital eccentricity and
argument of periapsis. Given the potential for a large ec-
centricity, the geometric bias eﬀect described by Kipping
(2014a) becomes pronounced and must be accounted
for. As was done in hypothesis B of the KOI-490.04
ﬁts, we use the geometry-corrected Beta prior from Kip-
ping (2014a) via a likelihood penalization implementa-

tion, adopting Beta shape parameters calibrated to the
long-period (> 1 year) radial velocity exoplanet catalog
(Kipping 2013a) (speciﬁcally ∼ Beta[1.12, 3.09]).

Unlike the case of Kepler-167d, the light curve plus
stellar density prior does provide a more constraining
posterior on the derived eccentricity than the prior. As
shown in Figure 7, the orbit is measured to be close to
circular, with e = 0.062+0.104
−0.043. Using the posteriors for
the fundamental stellar parameters derived using SPC
along with the Kepler-167b, c & d ρ(cid:63) constraint plus
isochrone matching, we estimate that Kepler-167e is ∼
10% smaller than Jupiter at 10.15+0.24−0.23 R⊕.

The posteriors from the ﬁt of Kepler-167e are shown
in Figure 12 and are available at this URL. The median
and 68.3% credible intervals for the basic parameters of
Kepler-167b, c, d & e are shown in Table 4.

6. DISCUSSION

6.1. A Transiting Jupiter Analog

Kepler-167e appears to be the ﬁrst example of a tran-
siting Jupiter analog, as deﬁned by its size (0.91 RJ),
low eccentricity (e = 0.06+0.10−0.04) and location beyond the
snow-line (see Figure 8). Although Jupiter analogs have
been found via other methods (e.g.
see Rowan et al.
2015), the geometric biases aﬀecting the transit method
make it highly unfavorable for discovering such worlds.
Kepler-167e has an a priori transit probability of (cid:39)
(cid:39) 3% occurrence rate
0.18%. Combined with the η(cid:88)
of Jupiter analogs (Rowan et al. 2015), one should ex-
pect O[10] transiting examples to exist amongst the
∼ 200, 000 stars observed by Kepler. However, only
those objects just beyond the snow-line and orbiting later
than Solar-type stars will have a chance to produce the
two transits needed to resolve the orbital period. Con-
sequently, it is possible that Kepler-167e could be the
only transiting Jupiter analog for which we can precisely
measure the period until the next generation of surveys.
The fact that Kepler-167e is transiting oﬀers the op-
portunity to probe the atmosphere of a genuine Jupiter
analog (Dalba et al. 2015), which has thus far been im-
possible. Whilst Kepler-167 is relatively faint in the V
band at 14.3, the fact that this is a late-type star means
the planet may be characterizable toward the near- and
mid-infrared bandpasses, where the K-band magnitude
is 11.8. This fact, combined with the very deep tran-
sit depth of 1.6%, makes atmospheric characterization a
challenging, but not impossible, task.

As was done by Kipping et al. (2014), we used the
Kennedy & Kenyon (2008) predictions for the time-
evolving snow-line of a ∼ 0.8 M(cid:12) star to estimate that
Kepler-167e’s present location corresponds to the snow-
line after ∼ 800, 000 years. This time is less than the
median lifetimes of protoplanetary disks of Solar-type
stars (e.g., Strom et al. 1993; Haisch et al. 2001) and
(Yasui et al. 2012),
since disk lifetimes scale as M
Kepler-167e could have formed at its present location.
Unlike Kepler-421b (Kipping et al. 2014), which was
“near” the snow-line, Kepler-167e is comfortably beyond
it for the majority of the disk lifetime.

are binned to a 10 minute cadence. Light curve of Kepler-167e uses 30 minute binning and uses circles to denote the ﬁrst transit (Q4) and
squares to denote the second transit (Q16). Note that all of the transits were ﬁtted using the original unbinned data.

With a radius close to that of Jupiter, Kepler-167e is
a member of the so-called “degenerate worlds” class8,
where the mass-radius relation is nearly ﬂat (Chen &
Kipping 2016). This class encompasses a diverse range
of masses, from that of Saturn to the most massive brown
dwarfs. On this basis, Kepler-167e’s radius is consistent
with being either a brown dwarf or a Jovian-like planet.

8 Formally, using the Chen & Kipping (2016) model, we estimate

an 80% probability that Kepler-167e is a degenerate world.

As argued by Chen & Kipping (2016), the division be-
tween brown dwarfs and gas giants is somewhat con-
trived, with both belonging to a continuum. Neverthe-
less, we evaluate the possibility that Kepler-167e’s mass
is greater than the 13 MJ canonical threshold (Spiegel et
al. 2011) here.

Using the radius-to-mass probabilistic forecasting code
of Chen & Kipping (2016), our radius samples can be
converted to predicted masses. Being a degenerate world,

Fig. 7.— Posterior distribution (solid) of the orbital eccentricity
of Kepler-167e, with comparison to the prior (dashed) describing
long-period transiting planets (Kipping 2014a). The eccentricity
is constrained by the comparison of the transit light curve shape
of Kepler-167e to the ρ(cid:63) constraint from the earlier joint ﬁt of
Kepler-167b, c & d.

Fig. 8.— Catalog of known transiting exoplanets with the color
depicting the peak wavelength color of the parent star. Solar Sys-
tem worlds are shown with black symbols and the Kepler-167 plan-
ets with squares. The blue-box depicts Jovian-sized planets beyond
the snow-line (∼ 0.25 S⊕), with Kepler-167e being the ﬁrst tran-
siting exoplanet to ﬁll this space. Data comes from the Exoplanet
Orbit Database (Wright et al. 2011).

this unsurprisingly returns a very broad distribution,
with the 68.3% credible interval spanning 0.3 MJ to
50 MJ. We ﬁnd that the probability of the mass be-
ing less than the hydrogen-burning limit to be 97.4%,
indicating that Kepler-167e is very unlikely to be a star.
Moreover, we ﬁnd 1.33 times more samples below the
13 MJ threshold than above it, implying a slight prefer-
ence for a Jupiter-like object.

Kipping et al.

This estimate can be improved by including a suitable
occurrence rate prior, for which we here use Cumming et
al. (2008) power-law of occurrence rate ∼ M−0.31. This
adds further weight to the Jupiter-like scenario with an
odds ratio of 4.28. We therefore estimate that Kepler-
167e is four times more likely to be a Jupiter-like planet
than a brown dwarf.

It may be possible for observers exclude the brown
dwarf hypothesis using radial velocities. If Kepler-167e is
a brown dwarf, then the radial velocity amplitude would
be K ≥ 31619−11 m s−1. In contrast, the (broad) forecasted
radial velocity amplitude is log10[K (m s−1)] = 2.32+0.75−1.47
(i.e. ∼ 211 m s−1).

6.3. Multibody Asterodensity Proﬁling

The eccentricity of Kepler-167e is measured purely us-
ing the transit shapes of the orbiting planets, represent-
ing a ﬁrst for the ﬁeld. In all previous cases, independent
information constraining the mean stellar density was
used, such as spectroscopic + isochrone analysis (Daw-
son & Johnson 2012), asteroseismology (Sliski & Kipping
2014) or ﬂicker (Kipping et al. 2014).

The eccentricity of a transiting planet can be measured
using asterodensity proﬁling (Kipping 2014b), speciﬁ-
cally via the photo-eccentric eﬀect (Dawson & Johnson
2012). This essentially compares the light curve derived
stellar density (related to the T14 and T23 transit du-
rations) to that derived via some independent method.
Although eccentricity is the dominant eﬀect, for Kepler-
167 the photo-blend eﬀect is in play too, due to the AO
detected companion.

Whilst the most common and accessible method to get
an independent mean stellar density is spectroscopy com-
bined with isochrone modeling, this approach essentially
makes the unrealistic assumption of zero-model error.
Multibody Asterodensity Proﬁling (Kipping et al. 2012)
was conceived with the idea of comparing the light curves
of planets orbiting the same star against one another, to
obviate the need to ever go through evolutionary mod-
els. In the case of multiple eccentric planets, the inverse
problem is quite challenging but the compact, inner three
planets of Kepler-167 are likely on near-circular orbits,
providing a so-called “stellar anchor” we can use to char-
acterize the star. This inference is then used to measure
the eccentricity of the outer planet, which a priori could
be much more eccentric.

We are able to measure the eccentricity to be
e = 0.06+0.10−0.04, which further supports the case that
Kepler-167e is a Jupiter analog. Critically, we empha-
size that this measurement used nothing more than the
Kepler photometric time series of a 14th magnitude star
and a single night of AO imaging on a 10 m telescope.
As a comparison, HD 32963b is a recently discovered
Jupiter analog found using radial velocities (Rowan
et al. 2015) for which 199 nights of precise radial
velocities on a 10 m class telescope led to the comparable
constraint of e = (0.07 ± 0.04), in spite of the fact that
HD 32963 is six and a half magnitudes brighter than
Kepler-167. However, the transit method does have
the major drawback that transiting Jupiter analogs are
far less numerous than their non-transiting counterparts.

Fig. 9.— Schematic illustrating the scale of the Kepler-167 sys-
tem. Planet sizes are scaled relative to the key, rather than the or-
bital distances in order to make them visible. The four known plan-
ets display remarkable coplanarity and near-circular orbits with the
habitable-zone (Kopparapu et al. 2013) notably devoid of transit-
ing planets.

6.4. System Architecture

All three inner planets orbit interior to the inner edge
of the habitable-zone (Kopparapu et al. 2013) and are
unlikely to be interesting from an astrobiological per-
spective. The architecture of the Kepler-167 system is
curious, with a compact multi followed by a large cavity
of transiting planets and then an outer Jupiter analog
(see Figure 9). Thus, Kepler-167 resembles a fusion of
the compact Kepler multis and the classic Solar System.
Since transit surveys have a very poor sensitivity to long-
period planets like Kepler-167e (planet yield ∼ P −5/3;
Beatty & Gaudi 2008), it is plausible that Kepler-167e-
like planets are found frequently in the Kepler compact
multis. A radial velocity survey targeting the bright Ke-
pler multis would be able to resolve this question.

Additional non-transiting planets could reside in the
Kepler-167 cavity, although the known four planets dis-
play remarkable coplanarity and low eccentricities, sug-
gestive of a dynamically cold system. Amongst the inner
planets, the planet sizes increase as one approaches the
parent star. Using the Chen & Kipping (2016) mass-
radius model, we estimate that the inner two planets are
most likely gaseous worlds whilst the outer planet is most
likely rocky (see Figure 10). Whilst this pattern ostensi-
bly jars our anthropocentric prior, as well as the expected
outcome of photo-evaporation (Lopez & Fortney 2013),
Ciardi et al. (2013) ﬁnd that there is no preferential or-
dering of compact Kepler multis for planets R (cid:46) 3R⊕.
The Kepler-167 system teases the possibility that com-
pact multis may plausibly harbor distant Jupiter analogs,
inviting the community to pursue this question with cur-
rent and future facilities. Moreover, whilst Kepler-167
is not a bright star, transiting Jupiter analogs represent
an important new class of targets in the on-going cam-
