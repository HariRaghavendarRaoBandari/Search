Abstract

We analyze a static and spherically symmetric hairy black hole solution in non–invariant mas-

sive gravity. The formalism of geometrothermodynamics is used to describe the thermodynamic

characteristics of this black hole in a Legendre invariant way. For a black hole in massive gravity,

the geometry of the space of equilibrium states is computed showing that it contains information

about the thermodynamic interaction, critical points and phase transitions structure.

INTRODUCTION

The search for a quantum theory of gravity has received attention of many researchers.

These investigations have suggested that general relativity will be superseded by a quantum

theory of gravity at high enough energies with respect to the Planck mass or the correspond-

ing Planck length [1]. The main idea is that general relativity is valid as an eﬀective ﬁeld

theory for length scales much larger that Planck length. If this theory is true, the possibil-

ity to proof it by experiments is almost hopeless. On the other hand, the most successful

cosmological model that is in agreement with the observational data implies the existence of

a vacuum energy related with the cosmological constant Λ, whose magnitude is unnatural

from the eﬀective ﬁeld theory point of view[2]. Hence, a dark energy is needed to reconcile

general relativity with the observations. The dark energy solves the problem of the acceler-

ated expansion of the Universe. Nevertheless, the interest to explain the acceleration of the

Universe without resorting to the dark energy has motivated the research for large–distances

modiﬁed theories of the gravity; the Lorentz–breaking massive gravity is one of these models

which is free from pathologies such as ghosts, low strong coupling scales or instabilities at

full non-perturbative level [3–5]. Although these models do not require the existence of Λ,

the cosmological constant problem remains open. A generalized Schwarzschild solution for

this model has been obtained by D. Comelli et al. which is an exact black hole solution

showing a nonanalytic hair [6].

The study of the thermodynamics of black holes and its relationship with geometry has

been a subject of intensive research [7–12]. This geometric study has been considered in

several papers by means of diﬀerent approaches like Weinhold’s theory [13], Ruppeiner’s

theory [14] or the most recent theory called geometrothermodynamics[15]. Geometrother-
modynamics (GTD) is a formalism that relates a contact structure of the phase space T with
the metric structure on a special subspace of T called the space of equilibrium states E. In
this work, we will use a Legendre invariant metric in the context of geometrotermodynamics

to formulate an invariant geometric representation of the thermodynamics of a static and

spherically symmetric hairy black hole solution in massive gravity.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we review the most important aspects of

the generalized Schwarzschild solution for massive gravity, emphasizing the thermodynamic

interpretation of its physical parameters. In Sec. III, we review the fundamentals of GTD.

2

In Sec. IV, we investigate the GTD of a black hole in massive gravity and show that it agrees

with the results following from the analysis of the corresponding thermodynamic variables.

Finally, in Sec. V, we present the conclusions of our work.

Spacial and spacetime indices are denoted by latin and greek letters, respectively. The second

integral is the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term [21, 22], where γ is the metric induced
on the boundary ∂M and K is the trace of the extrinsic curvature Kij = 1
i∇knj of M
with unit normal ni. Such a boundary term is required to have a well-deﬁned variational
principle in the presence of the border ∂M.

Spherically symmetric black holes in massive gravity have been investigated in [6, 21–23]

and it was found that a set of coordinates always can be found where the solution can be

written in the form

ds2 = f (r)dt2 + f (r)−1dr2 + r2(dθ2 sin2 θdϕ2) ,

and the ﬁelds are given by the expressions[21]:

φ0 = Λ2[t + h(r)] ,

where M and Q are integration constants and λ 6= 1 is a positive constant. In the case λ > 1
the gravitational potential is asymptotically Newtonian and the parameter M coincides with

the ADM mass, while Q is a scalar charge whose presence reﬂects the modiﬁcation of the

gravitational interaction as compared to General Relativity.

The roots of the lapse function f (gtt = 0) deﬁne the horizons r = r± of the spacetime.

In particular, the null hypersurface r = r+ can be shown to correspond to an event horizon,

which in this case is also a Killing horizon, whereas the inner horizon at r− is a Cauchy

horizon. Therefore from f (r+) = 0 [19] we get,

This equation relates all the thermodynamic variables entering the black hole metric

in the form of a fundamental thermodynamic equation M = M(S, Q). Equation (10) is

an inhomogeneous function in the extensive variables S and Q. Following Davies [24], we

homogenisize the fundamental equation by redeﬁning the parameter Q as,

Q = q

Then, equation (10) becomes a homogeneous function of degree 1

2 in the extensive variables.
This procedure was performed explicitly in the context of GTD in [25]. In this case Euler’s

theorem takes the form [24],

III. REVIEW OF GEOMETROTHERMODYNAMICS

Geometrothermodynamics is a theory that has been formulated in order to introduce the

Lagendre invariance in the geometric description of the thermodynamic equilibrium states

7

[15]. This theory has been applied to diﬀerent thermodynamic systems like black holes, ideal

gas or Van der Waals gas [26, 27, 30–35]. In all the cases investigated so far, GTD leads

to consistent results that describe geometrically the phases transitions and thermodynamic

interaction using Legendre invariant metrics.

The main ingredient of GTD is a (2n+1)–dimensional manifold T with a set of coordinates
Z A which allow us to deﬁne a non–degenerate Legendre invariant metric G together with a
linear diﬀerential 1–form Θ which fulﬁlls the condition Θ∧(dΘ)n 6= 0, where n is the number
of thermodynamic degrees of freedom, ∧ represents the exterior product and d the exterior
derivative. In GTD, we also have the space of thermodynamic equilibrium states which is
a submanifold E ⊂ T deﬁned by means of a smooth embedding mapping ϕ : E −→ T such
that the pullback ϕ∗(Θ) = 0.

With the above elements a metric g is induced in E by means of ϕ∗(G) = g, giving a
Riemannian structure to this space. So, in GTD the physical properties of a thermodynamic

system in a state of equilibrium are described in terms of the geometric properties of the
corresponding space E.

The set of elements (T , Θ, G) with the conditions above mentioned is called a contact
Riemannian manifold. If we consider the 2n + 1–dimensional space T coordinatized by the
set Z A =nΦ , Ea , I ao where A = 0, . . . , 2n and a = 1, . . . n, the 1-form Θ will be

Θ = dΦ − IadEa .

We choose now the subset Ea as coordinates of E. Then, the mapping ϕ is given by

ϕ : (Ea) −→ (Φ , Ea , I a) ,

and the condition,

ϕ∗(Θ) = ϕ∗(dΦ − δabI adEb) = 0 ,

(24)

(25)

(26)

leads to the standard conditions of the thermodynamic equilibrium and the ﬁrst law of

thermodynamics,

8

∂Φ
∂Ea = Ia ,

dΦ = IadEa .

The second law of thermodynamics under this formalism is written as,

∂2U

∂Ea∂Eb ≥ 0 ,

;

∂2S

∂F a∂F b ≤ 0 ,

(27)

(28)

where U and S represent the energy and entropy for each of the corresponding thermody-

namic systems. Here Ea (F a) represent all the extensive variables other than U (S).

In GTD the only requirement for deﬁning a metric G of the space T is that it fulﬁlls
the condition of Legendre invariance; therefore, we have many possibilities of constructing

a metric with these features. In fact, all the Legendre invariant metrics found so far can be

classiﬁed in three classes. It turns out that each class can be used to describe thermodynamic

systems with particular phase transitions [27]. For instance, for systems with second order

phase transitions, the most general metric can be expressed as,

G = Θ2 + (δabEaI b)(ηcddEcdI d) ,

(29)

where δab = diag(1, 1, . . . , 1) and ηab = diag(−1, 1, . . . , 1) . It can be shown that the metric
(29) is invariant with respect to a total Legendre transformation which changes the coordi-
nates {Φ, Ea, I a} to the coordinates { ˜Φ, ˜Ea, ˜I a} using the following algebraic rules,

Φ = ˜Φ − ˜Ea ˜I a ,

Ea = − ˜I a ,

I a = ˜Ea .

(30)

Applying the pullback ϕ∗ to the metric (29), we obtain the corresponding thermodynamic

metric g,

gGT D = ϕ∗(G) =(cid:16)Ec ∂Φ

∂Ec(cid:17)(cid:16)ηabδbc

∂2Φ

∂Ec∂Ed dEadEd(cid:17) ,

(31)

which depends only of the fundamental potential Φ = Φ(Ea). If we know the fundamental

potential of the thermodynamic system that we want to study, the corresponding metric g

can be computed explicitly and the relations between thermodynamic and geometry can be

also studied.

IV. GEOMETROTHERMODYNAMICS IN MASSIVE GRAVITY

Let us consider a thermodynamic system with two degrees of freedom.

If we choose

thermodynamic potential as Φ = M and the coordinates of equilibrium manifold as Ea =
{S, q}, then the corresponding metric is given as

the GTD metric coeﬃcients, which can be written as,

There are two curvature singularities in this case. The ﬁrst one occurs if q

and corresponds to M = 0, as follows from Eq.(10), see also ﬁgure 3. This means that this

singularity is non physical since no black hole is present in this case. A second singularity
π(cid:17)
is located at the roots of the equation (cid:16) S
2 (1 − λ2) = 0. For the interval 1 − λ2 > 0,
according to (21), it coincides with the points where C −→ ∞, i. e., with the points where
second order phase transitions take place. The general behavior of the curvature scalar is

FIG. 4: The curvature scalar RGT D as a function of the entropy (left), with q = 1, and as a function

According to GTD, these results show that there exist curvature singularities at those

points where second order phase transitions occur, because the denominators of the heat

capacity and the curvature scalar coincide [27]. We can also observe, ﬁgure 4, that the

11

curvature scalar changes spontaneously its sign indicating a transition of the a stable region

to the unstable one, reproducing the thermodynamic behavior of this black hole.

V. WEINHOLD AND RUPPEINER APPROACHES

In this section we analyze the thermodynamic geometry of the same black hole in massive

gravity by using Weinhold and Ruppeiner metrics.

The Weinhold metric is deﬁned as [13]

gW = (

∂2M
∂S2 dS2 + 2

∂2M
∂S∂q

dS2 +

∂2M

∂q2 dq2(cid:17) .

(37)

Using the fundamental thermodynamic equation M = M(S, q), the metric (37) can be

calculated and we obtain explicitly the Weinhold metric coeﬃcients which can be written

as,

gW = −

The curvature scalar corresponding to the metric (38) takes the form,

RW = 0 ,

(38)

(39)

This result tells us that the space of thermodynamic equilibrium is ﬂat, indicating the

lack of thermodynamic interaction. Obviously, this result contradicts the results obtained

by using black hole thermodynamics.

The case of Ruppeiner’s geometry for thermodynamical systems must be computed in the

entropy representation. However, as has been shown in [29] one can prove that Ruppeiner’s

metric, gR, is proportional to Weinhold’s metric, gW as gR = (1/T )gW , where T is the

temperature. Using this result Ruppeiner’s metric takes the form,

is singular and the black longdash vertical lines represent the points where the curvature scalar of

the Ruppeiner metric diverges.

13

We can see that the Ruppeiner’s geometry is curved, signaling interaction for this thermo-

dynamic system. There are singular points, but they are not consistent with the divergencies

of the heat capacity for ﬁxed charge.

The fact that Ruppeiner’s curvature scalar in this case doesn’t diverge at the same points

where the heat capacity does, tell us that it is not possible to associate curvature singularities

with second-order phase transitions.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we analyzed the thermodynamic and geometrothermodynamic properties

of a black hole solution in massive gravity. Using the fundamental equation of a spherically

symmetric black hole we found the geometric properties of the corresponding manifold of

equilibrium states. We found that the corresponding thermodynamic curvature turned out

to be nonzero, indicating the presence of thermodynamic interaction. A numerical and

analytical study of the thermodynamic curvature shows that the phase transitions which

are characterized by divergencies of the heat capacity are described in GTD by curvature

singularities in the equilibrium manifold.

We assumed in this work Davies’s proposal to solve the problem of the lack of homo-

geneity of the fundamental equation. We have considered the deﬁnition (11), with which

the fundamental equation (9) becomes a homogeneous function of degree 1
2 in the extensive
variables. We have also shown that for values of the constant λ in the interval λ2 − 1 < 0,
the black holes in massive gravity presents a phase transition. Therefore, it would be in-

teresting to investigate further λ as a thermodynamic variable in order to learn more about

the thermodynamics and phase transition structure of these black holes.

We analyzed the thermodynamic geometry based on the Weinhold metric and found

that it represents a ﬂat space, indicating the lack of thermodynamic interaction. We also

analyzed the Ruppeiner’s metric for this system and found that corresponds to a curved

manifold for this black hole and the corresponding curvature diverges at some points, but

these points are not the ones at where the heat capacity for ﬁxed charge diverges. We

conclude that the Weinhold and Ruppeiner’s geometries do not describe correctly the ther-

modynamic geometry of black holes in massive gravity. We interpret this result as indication

that it is necessary to take into account Legendre invariance in order to correctly describe

14

thermodynamics from a geometric point of view.
