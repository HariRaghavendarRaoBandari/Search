Abstract

A set V in a domain U in Cn has the norm-preserving extension property if
every bounded holomorphic function on V has a holomorphic extension to U with
the same supremum norm. We prove that an algebraic subset of the symmetrized
bidisc

G def= {(z + w, zw) : |z| < 1, |w| < 1}

has the norm-preserving extension property if and only if it is either a singleton,
G itself, a complex geodesic of G, or the union of the set {(2z, z2) : |z| < 1} and
a complex geodesic of degree 1 in G. We also prove that the complex geodesics in
G coincide with the nontrivial holomorphic retracts in G. Thus, in contrast to the
case of the ball or the bidisc, there are sets in G which have the norm-preserving
extension property but are not holomorphic retracts of G.
In the course of the
proof we obtain a detailed classiﬁcation of the complex geodesics in G modulo
automorphisms of G. We give applications to von Neumann-type inequalities for
Γ-contractions (that is, commuting pairs of operators for which the closure of G
is a spectral set) and for symmetric functions of commuting pairs of contractive
operators. We ﬁnd three other domains that contain sets with the norm-preserving
extension property which are not retracts: they are the spectral ball of 2× 2 matri-
ces, the tetrablock and the pentablock. We also identify the subsets of the bidisc
which have the norm-preserving extension property for symmetric functions.

Preface

The symmetrized bidisc is just one domain in C2, but it is a fascinating one
which amply repays a detailed study. In the absence of a Riemann mapping the-
orem in dimensions greater than one there is a choice between studying broad
classes of domains and choosing some special domains. From the work of Oka on-
wards there has developed a beautiful and extensive theory of general domains of
holomorphy; however, in such generality there can be no expectation of a detailed
analytic function theory along the lines of the spectacularly successful theory of
functions on the unit disc, which is one of the pinnacles of twentieth century anal-
ysis. For this reason the general theory is complemented by the study of functions
on special domains such as the ball and the polydisc [42, 43], or more generally
Cartan domains [30, 26]. Thereafter it seems natural to investigate inhomogeneous
domains for which a detailed function theory is possible. The symmetrized bidisc
G in C2 is emphatically one such. It is inhomogeneous, but it has a 3-parameter
group of automorphisms. It is closely related to the bidisc, being the image of the
bidisc under the polynomial map (λ1 + λ2, λ1λ2). Its geometry and function theory
have many resemblances to, but also many diﬀerences from, those of the bidisc. It
transpires that many quantities of interest for G, for example the Kobayashi and
Carath´eodory distances, can be calculated in a fairly explicit form.

We originally started studying the symmetrized bidisc in connection with the
spectral Nevanlinna-Pick problem, an interpolation problem for analytic 2 × 2-
matrix-valued functions subject to a bound on the spectral radius. This problem
is of interest in certain engineering problems. We can claim only partial success
in resolving the interpolation problem, but we happened on a rich vein of function
theory, which was of particular interest to specialists in the theories of invariant
distances [32] and models of multioperators [18].

In this paper we determine the holomorphic retractions of G and the sub-
sets of G which permit the extension of holomorphic functions without increase
of supremum norm. The methods we use are of independent interest: we analyse
the complex geodesics of G, and show that there are ﬁve qualitatively diﬀerent
types thereof. The type of a complex geodesic D can be characterized in two quite
diﬀerent ways. One way is in terms of the intersection of D with the special variety

R def= {(2z, z2) : |z| < 1}.

R is itself a complex geodesic of G, uniquely speciﬁed by the property that it is
invariant under every automorphism of G. Remarkably, the type of D can also
be characterized by the number of Carath´eodory extremal functions for D from
a certain one-parameter family of extremals. In contrast, for the bidisc, one can
deﬁne types of complex geodesics in an analogous way, and one ﬁnds that there are
only two types.

Introduction

A celebrated theorem of H. Cartan states the following [21].

Theorem 1.1. If V is an analytic variety in a domain of holomorphy U and
if f is an analytic function on V then there exists an analytic function on U whose
restriction to V is f .

In the case that the function f is bounded, Cartan’s theorem gives no informa-
tion on the supremum norm of any holomorphic extension of f . We are interested
in the case that an extension exists with the same supremum norm as f .

Definition 1.2. A subset V of a domain U has the norm-preserving extension
property if, for every bounded analytic function f on V , there exists an analytic
function g on U such that

g|V = f

and

U |g| = sup
sup

V |f|.

Here V is not assumed to be a variety; to say that f is analytic on V simply
means that, for every z ∈ V there exists a neighborhood W of z in U and an
analytic function h on W such that h agrees with f on W ∩ V .
There are at least two reasons to be interested in the norm-preserving extension
property, one function-theoretic and one operator-theoretic. In the case that U is
the bidisc, the description of the solutions of an interpolation problem for holomor-
phic functions on U leads to norm-preserving extensions, while knowledge of the
sets having the norm-preserving extension property in the bidisc also leads to an
improvement of Ando’s inequality for pairs of commuting contractions [2, Section
1].

The subsets of the bidisc D2 having the norm-preserving extension property
were identiﬁed in [2]. In this memoir we shall do the same for the symmetrized
bidisc. Let C denote the complex ﬁeld and D the unit disc {z ∈ C : |z| < 1}. The
symmetrization map is the map π : C2 → C2 given by

π(λ1, λ2) = (λ1 + λ2, λ1λ2),

λ1, λ2 ∈ C,

and the symmetrized bidisc is the set

G = π(D2)

= {(z + w, zw) : z, w ∈ D} ⊂ C2.

Retracts of a domain have the norm-preserving extension property. A (holo-
morphic) retraction of U is a holomorphic map of ρ : U → U such that ρ ◦ ρ = ρ,
and a retract in U is a set which is the range of a retraction of U . Evidently, for
any retraction ρ, a bounded analytic function f on ran ρ has the analytic norm-
preserving extension f ◦ ρ to U . Two simple types of retracts of U are singleton

1. INTRODUCTION

sets and the whole of U ; these retracts are trivial. Hyperbolic geometry in the sense
of Kobayashi [34] provides an approach to the construction of nontrivial retracts.
A complex geodesic of U is the range V of a holomorphic map k : D → U which
has a holomorphic left inverse C. Here, since C ◦ k is the identity map idD on D,
clearly k ◦ C is a retraction of U with range V .

To summarize, for a subset V of a domain U , the statements

(1) V is a singleton, a complex geodesic or all of U ,
(2) V is a retract in U ,
(3) V has the norm-preserving extension property in U
satisfy (1) implies (2) implies (3). It was shown in [2] that, in the case that U is
the bidisc D2, the converse implications also hold. One might conjecture that the
same is true for a general domain in D2; however, the two main results of the paper
show that, for the symmetrized bidisc, (2) implies (1) but (3) does not imply (2).

Theorem 1.3. A subset V of G is a nontrivial retract of G if and only if V is

a complex geodesic of G.

Since complex geodesics in G are algebraic sets, as we prove in Theorem 5.4

below, it follows that retracts in G are algebraic sets.

A ﬂat geodesic of G is a complex geodesic of G which is the intersection of G

with a complex line: see Proposition 4.16.

Theorem 1.4. V is an algebraic subset of G having the norm-preserving ex-
tension property if and only if either V is a retract in G or V = R ∪ D, where
R = {(2z, z2) : z ∈ D} and D is a ﬂat geodesic in G.

preserving extension property(see Theorem 10.1).

Sets of the form R ∪ D are not retracts of G, but nevertheless have the norm-
Theorems 1.3 and 1.4 have applications to the function theory of the bidisc, the
theory of von Neumann inequalities for commuting pairs of operators and the com-
plex geometry of certain domains in dimensions three and four. These applications
are given in Chapters 13 to 15. They are brieﬂy described in the next chapter.

It should be mentioned that there is a substantial theory of holomorphic exten-
sions that reﬁnes Cartan’s Theorem 1.1. However, as far as we know the results in
the literature barely overlap the theorems in this paper. Previous authors (with the
exception of [2, 19]) do not consider such a stringent condition as the preservation
of the supremum norm, and they typically consider either other special domains,
such as polydiscs or polyhedra [13, 40, 24], or strictly pseudoconvex domains [29]
(note that G is not smoothly embedded in C2).

CHAPTER 2

An overview

Much of this memoir is devoted to the proof of the main result, Theorem 1.4

from the introduction.

Neither necessity nor suﬃciency is trivial. Suﬃciency is proved in Chapters 5
and 10. In the former it is shown that complex geodesics in G are algebraic sets
and that nontrivial retracts are complex geodesics. In the latter the Herglotz Rep-
resentation Theorem is used to show that R∪D has the norm-preserving extension
property. The proof of necessity in Theorem 1.4 takes up the remainder of Chapters
3 to 12.

The principal tool is the theory of hyperbolic complex spaces in the sense of
Kobayashi [34]. The Carath´eodory and Kobayashi extremal problems are described
in Section 3.1. There is a substantial theory of these two problems in the special
case of the symmetrized bidisc; the relevant parts of it are described in Chapters
3 and 4. More of the known function theory of G, with citations, is given in the
Appendix.

There are two versions of the Carath´eodory and Kobayashi extremal problems,
one for pairs of points and one for tangent vectors. In order to treat both versions
of the problems simultaneously we introduce the terminology of datums. A datum
in a domain U is either a pair of points in U or an element of the tangent bundle
of U ; the former is a discrete datum, the latter an inﬁnitesimal datum. If V is a
subset of U and δ is a datum in U then δ contacts V if either

(1) δ = (s1, s2) is discrete and both s1 and s2 lie in V , or
(2) δ = (s, v) is inﬁnitesimal and either v = 0 and s ∈ V , or there exist two
sequences of points {sn} and {tn} in V such that sn 6= tn for all n, sn → s,
tn → s and

tn − sn
ktn − snk → v0,

for some unit vector v0 collinear with v.

A datum δ is degenerate if either δ = (s1, s2) is discrete and s1 = s2 or δ = (s, v) is
inﬁnitesimal and v = 0. An important property of G is that every nondegenerate
datum δ in G contacts a unique complex geodesic of G, denoted by Dδ.
The proof of necessity in Theorem 1.4 is based on an analysis of the datums
that contact a subset V of G having the norm-preserving extension property. We
divide the nondegenerate datums in G into ﬁve types, called purely unbalanced, ex-
ceptional, purely balanced, royal and ﬂat. The deﬁnitions of these types (Deﬁnition
3.4 in Section 3.3) for a datum δ are in terms of the Carath´eodory extremal func-
tions for the datum δ. We use another special feature of G: for every nondegenerate
datum in G there is a solution Φω of the Carath´eodory extremal problem having

the form

Φω(s) =

for some ω ∈ T, where T denotes the unit circle in C (Theorem A.4). For royal
and ﬂat datums, every Φω is a Carath´eodory extremal for δ. If there are exactly
two values of ω ∈ T for which Φω is extremal for δ, then δ is said to be purely
balanced. If there is a unique ω ∈ T for which Φω is extremal for δ, then we say
that δ is either purely unbalanced or exceptional, depending on whether a certain
second derivative is zero. The strategy is to consider the consequences for V of the
hypothesis that a datum of each of the ﬁve types in turn contacts V .

To put this plan into eﬀect we have to establish several results about types
of datum. Firstly, according to Theorem 3.6, every nondegenerate datum in G
is of exactly one of the ﬁve types. A second important fact is that the type of
a nondegenerate datum δ can be characterized in terms of the geometry of the
complex geodesic Dδ; this is the gist of Chapters 6 and 7, and it requires some
detailed calculations. The upshot is (Theorem 7.1) that the type of a datum δ is
determined by the number and location of the points of intersection of D−
δ and the
royal variety R− = {(2z, z2) : |z| ≤ 1} (that is, whether these points belong to G
or ∂G). This result has two signiﬁcant consequences: (1) the type of a datum is
preserved by automorphisms of G, and (2) if two nondegenerate datums contact
the same complex geodesic then they have the same type. We may therefore deﬁne
the type of a complex geodesic D to be the type of any nondegenerate datum that
contacts D, whereupon the complex geodesics of G are themselves partitioned into
ﬁve types. In particular, R is the sole geodesic of royal type, and the geodesics of
ﬂat type are precisely the complex lines

(2.1)
for β ∈ D. These ﬂat geodesics constitute a foliation of G. Theorem 7.8 gives
concrete formulae for each of the ﬁve types of geodesics modulo automorphisms of
G.

Here is a rough outline of the proof of necessity in Theorem 1.4. Let V be an
algebraic set in G having the norm-preserving extension property. We may assume
that V is neither a singleton set nor G. We must show that either V is a complex
geodesic in G or V = R ∪ D for some ﬂat geodesic D.
Chapter 9 proves some consequences of the assumption that V has contact with
certain types of datum. Lemma 9.6 states that if some ﬂat, royal or purely balanced
datum δ contacts V then Dδ ⊆ V . According to Lemma 9.10, if a ﬂat datum δ
contacts V then V is the ﬂat geodesic Dδ (which is a retract in G) or V = R ∪ Dδ,
while Lemma 9.11 states that if a royal datum contacts V then either V = R or
V = R ∪ D for some ﬂat geodesic D. Hence Chapter 9 reduces the problem to the
case that neither a ﬂat nor a royal datum contacts V . By Lemma 12.2, if a purely
balanced datum δ contacts V then V is the purely balanced geodesic Dδ.
In Chapter 11 and in Chapter 12 it is shown that if no ﬂat datum contacts V
then V is a properly embedded planar Riemann surface of ﬁnite type, meaning that
the boundary of V has ﬁnitely many connected components. Finite connectedness
is proved with the aid of real algebraic geometry, speciﬁcally, from the permanence
properties of semialgebraic sets, which follow from the Tarski-Seidenberg Theorem.
By a classical theorem on ﬁnitely connected domains [22, Theorem 7.9], V is con-
formally equivalent to a ﬁnitely-circled domain R in the complex plane, meaning

2. AN OVERVIEW

5

that the boundary ∂R is a union of ﬁnitely many disjoint circles. In Lemma 12.3
we prove that if ∂R has a single component then V is a nontrivial retract in G and
so is a complex geodesic of G. To complete the proof it remains to show that, if V
has no contact with any ﬂat, royal or purely balanced datum, then ∂R has a single
component. This task is achieved by a winding number argument that depends on
known properties of Ahlfors functions for the domain R; this argument takes up
Sections 12.1 and 12.2.

Finally, some applications of the main results are presented in the last three
chapters. In Chapter 13 we identify the symmetric subsets of the bidisc which have
the symmetric extension property (roughly, the norm-preserving extension property
for symmetric functions). In Theorem 13.5 we show that there are six mutually
exclusive classes of such sets and we give explicit formulae for them.

In Chapter 14 we give two applications of Theorem 1.4 to the theory of spectral
sets. Theorem 14.4 states that the sets V of Theorem 13.5 are the only symmetric
algebraic sets of D2 for which the inequality

kf (T )k ≤ sup

V |f|

holds for all bounded symmetric holomorphic functions f on V and all pairs of
commuting contractions T subordinate to V (subordination is the condition needed
to ensure that f (T ) be well deﬁned).

For any set A of bounded holomorphic functions on a set V ⊆ C2, we say that

V is an A-von Neumann set if

kf (T )k ≤ sup

V |f|

for all f ∈ A and all pairs T of commuting contractions which are subordinate to
V . Here subordination is the natural notion that ensures that the operator f (T )
be well deﬁned. In Theorem 14.4 we show that if V is a symmetric algebraic subset
of D2 and A is the algebra of all bounded symmetric holomorphic functions on V
then V is an A-von Neumann set if and only if V belongs to one of the six classes
of sets which are described by explicit formulae in Theorem 13.5.

For the second application we need to introduce a variant of the notion of A-von
Neumann set that is adapted to G. Consider a subset V of G and let A be a set
of bounded holomorphic functions on V . We say that V is a (G, A)-von Neumann
set if V is a spectral set for every Γ-contraction T subordinate to V . Here a Γ-
contraction is a pair of commuting operators for which Γ is a spectral set. Let A be
the algebra of all bounded holomorphic functions on V . In Theorem 14.7 we show
that if V is algebraic then V is a (G, A)-von Neumann set if and only if either V is
a retract in G or V = R ∪ D, where D is a ﬂat geodesic in G (as in equation (2.1)
above).
In Chapter 15 we observe that in any domain which contains G as a holomorphic
retract there are sets that have the norm-preserving extension property but are not
retracts. In particular this observation applies to the 2 × 2 spectral ball (which
comprises the 2 × 2 matrices of spectral radius less than one) and two domains in
C3 known as the tetrablock and the pentablock.
In a digression in Section 5.2 we show that our geometric method based on
uniqueness of solutions of certain Carath´eodory problems can be used to give an
alternative proof of a result of Heath and Suﬀridge [28] on the retracts of the bidisc
(they all have the form of either a singleton, D2 itself or a complex geodesic).

CHAPTER 3

Extremal problems in the symmetrized bidisc G

In this chapter we shall set out our notation and give a brief exposition of
some known properties of the Carath´eodory and Kobayashi extremal problems on
the symmetrized bidisc. We introduce the notion of a datum, which permits the
simultaneous analysis of the discrete and inﬁnitesimal versions of the Kobayashi
and Carath´eodory problems.

If U is an open set in Cn, then by a datum in U we mean an ordered pair δ

where either δ is discrete, that is, has the form

δ = (s1, s2)

where s1, s2 ∈ U , or δ is inﬁnitesimal, that is, δ is an element of the tangent bundle
T U of U , and so has the form

δ = (s, v)

where s ∈ U and v is a tangent vector to U at s. We identify the tangent vector

∂s1 + ··· + vn ∂
v1 ∂

∂sn

with

(v1, . . . , vn) ∈ Cn.

If δ is a datum, we say that δ is degenerate if either δ is discrete and s1 = s2 or δ
is inﬁnitesimal and v = 0, and nondegenerate otherwise. If U ⊆ Cn1 and Ω ⊆ Cn2
are two open sets we denote by Ω(U ) the set of holomorphic mappings from U into
Ω. Furthermore, if F ∈ Ω(U ), s ∈ U , and v ∈ Cn1, we denote by DvF (s) the
directional derivative at s of F in the direction v.

For any set X we denote by idX the identity map on X.
If U and Ω are domains, F ∈ Ω(U ), and δ is a datum in U , we deﬁne a datum

F (δ) in Ω by

when δ is discrete and by

when δ is inﬁnitesimal.

F (δ) = (F (s1), F (s2))

F (δ) = F∗δ = (F (s), DvF (s))

Note that if U, V and W are domains, δ is a datum in U and F ∈ V (U ), G ∈

W (V ), then

Let δ be a datum in D. We deﬁne the modulus of δ, denoted by |δ|, by

Bα(z) =

for z ∈ D.

3.1. The Carath´eodory and Kobayashi extremal problems

If U is a domain (an open set in Cn for some n) and δ is a datum in U , then
we may consider the Carath´eodory Optimization Problem, that is, to compute the
quantity |δ|car deﬁned by

|δ|car = sup

F ∈D(U)|F (δ)|.

In the sequel we shall refer to this problem as Car(δ). The notation suppresses the
dependence of both |δ|car and Car(δ) on U . However, this will not be a cause for
confusion, as the domain U will always be clear from the context. We say that C
solves Car(δ) if C ∈ D(U ) and

|δ|car = |C(δ)|.

In [32, Section 2.1], the function | · |car, when applied to discrete datums, is called
the M¨obius pseudodistance for U , while, when applied to inﬁnitesimal datums, |·|car
is called the Carath´eodory-Reiﬀen pseudometric for U .
If U is a domain and δ is a datum in U , then we may also consider the Kobayashi

Extremal Problem for δ, that is, to compute the quantity |δ|kob deﬁned by
(3.2)
|δ|kob = inf{|ζ| : ζ is a datum in D and there exists f ∈ U (D) such that f (ζ) = δ}.
In the sequel we shall refer to this problem as Kob(δ). We say that k solves Kob(δ)
if k ∈ U (D) and there is a datum ζ in D such that

k(ζ) = δ

and

|δ|kob = |ζ|.

In [32, Section 3.1], for discrete datums, the function tanh−1 | · |kob is called the
Lempert function for U . In [32, Section 3.5], for inﬁnitesimal datums, the function
| · |kob is called the Kobayashi-Royden pseudometric for U .
For any nondegenerate datum δ in U there exists k ∈ U (D) and C ∈ D(U )
that solve |δ|kob and |δ|car respectively [34]. It is immediate from the Schwarz-Pick
Lemma that, for any nondegenerate datum δ in U , |δ|car ≤ |δ|kob.

Proposition 3.1. Let h ∈ U (D), C ∈ D(U ) be such that C ◦ h = idD. If ζ is

a datum in D and δ = h(ζ) then h solves Kob(δ).

For then

|δ|car ≥ |C(δ)| = |C ◦ h(ζ)| = |ζ| ≥ |δ|kob ≥ |δ|car

and so |ζ| = |δ|kob.

3.2. The Carath´eodory extremal problem Car(δ) for G

We say that a set C ⊆ D(U ) is a universal set for the Carath´eodory problem on
U if, whenever δ is a nondegenerate datum in U , there exists a function C ∈ C such
that C solves Car(δ).
On the bidisc, the two co-ordinate functions constitute a universal set for the
Carath´eodory problem. On G, there is a one-parameter family that constitutes a
universal set.

(3.3)

Φ(z, s1, s2) =

2zs2 − s1
2 − zs1 .

We shall write Φz(s) as a synonym for Φ(z, s1, s2) where s = (s1, s2).

Each Φω does belong to D(G): see Proposition A.1 in the Appendix. The
following statement is in Theorem 1.1 (for discrete datums) and Corollary 4.3 (for
inﬁnitesimal datums) in [5].

Theorem 3.3. The set C = {Φω : ω ∈ T} is a universal set for the Carath´eodory

problem on G.

Theorem 3.3 provides a concrete way of analyzing the Carath´eodory problem
on G. Indeed, if, for a nondegenerate datum δ, we deﬁne a function ρδ on the circle
by the formula

(3.4)

ρδ(ω) = |Φω(δ)|2,

ω ∈ T,

then Theorem 3.3 implies that

3.3. Five types of datum δ in G

The following deﬁnition formalizes ﬁve qualitative cases for the behavior of the

Carath´eodory extremal problem for G.

Definition 3.4. Let δ be a nondegenerate datum in G. We say that δ is

(1) purely unbalanced if ρδ has a unique maximizer ω0 = eit0 and

(2) exceptional if ρδ has a unique maximizer ω0 = eit0 and

d2

< 0;

= 0;

(3) purely balanced if ρδ has exactly two maximizers in T;
(4) royal if ρδ is constant and C(s) = 1
2 s1 solves Car(δ);
(5) ﬂat if ρδ is constant and C(s) = s2 solves Car(δ).
Finally, we say that δ is balanced if δ is either exceptional, purely balanced, or royal
and we say that δ is unbalanced if δ is either purely unbalanced or ﬂat.

Pentachotomy Theorem 3.6. If δ is a nondegenerate datum in G, then
exactly one of the cases (1) to (5) in Deﬁnition 3.4 obtains. In particular, either δ
is balanced or δ is unbalanced and not both.

10

3. EXTREMAL PROBLEMS IN THE SYMMETRIZED BIDISC G

Proof. Case 1: δ is discrete.

(i) Suppose that ρδ is constant on T. By Theorem A.14 either (a) (s1
j = 1, 2 or (b) there exists β ∈ D such that s1
we may write sj = (2zj, z2

j for
j for j = 1, 2. In case (a)

j = β + ¯βs2

j . We then ﬁnd that

j ) where zj = 1

j )2 = 4s2

2 s1

Φω(sj ) = −zj

independently of ω, and so, by equations (3.4) and (3.5),
|δ|2
Since the function C(s) = 1
and so, according to Deﬁnition 3.4, δ is a royal datum.

car = ρδ(ω) = |Φω(δ)|2 = |(Φω(s1), Φω(s2))|2 = |(−z1,−z2)|2 = |(z1, z2)|2 = |( 1
2 s1
2 s1 belongs to D(G), it follows that C solves Car(δ),

In case (b) we have sj = (β + ¯βzj, zj), where zj = s2

j . A simple calculation

2 s1

2)|2.

shows that, for any ω ∈ T,

Φω(sj) = mω(zj)

for j = 1, 2,
for some mω ∈ Aut D. Again by equations (3.4) and (3.5),
|δ|2
Hence C(s) = s2 solves Car(δ), and so δ is a ﬂat datum.

car = sup

ω |Φω(δ)|2 = |(Φω(s1), Φω(s2))|2 = |(mω(z1), mω(z2))|2 = |(z1, z2)|2 = |(s2

2)|2.

(ii) Now suppose that ρδ is not constant on T. It is clear from the deﬁnition of

ρδ,

ρδ(eit) = |Φeit (s1, s2)|2 =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

that the function t 7→ ρδ(eit) is smooth and 2π-periodic, and so attains its maximum
over [0, 2π) at some point t0, which is a critical point satisfying

d2

dt2 ρδ(eit)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=t0 ≤ 0.

In fact, by Theorem A.13, ρδ attains its supremum over T at either one or two
points.
In the former case δ is either purely unbalanced or exceptional, and in
the latter case δ is purely balanced. We have shown that, for any nondegenerate
discrete datum δ in G, at least one of (1) to (5) is true.

Conditions (1), (2) and (3) are clearly mutually exclusive. Moreover, since they
together correspond to ρδ being nonconstant on T, they are inconsistent with (4)
and (5). It remains to show that δ cannot be both ﬂat and royal. If it is, then
by the calculations above there exists β ∈ D such that both s1 and s2 lie in the
intersection of the sets

{(β + ¯βz, z) : z ∈ D} and {s ∈ G : (s1)2 = 4s2}.

Thus the equation

(β + ¯βz)2 = 4z

has two distinct roots for z ∈ D; this is easily seen to be false. Hence a nondegen-
erate discrete datum cannot be both royal and ﬂat. We have shown that exactly
one of the cases (1) to (5) obtains for any discrete datum δ.

Case 2: δ = (s1, v) is a nondegenerate inﬁnitesimal datum in G.

(i) Suppose that ρδ is constant on T. By Theorem A.15, ρδ is constant on T if and
only if one of the following conditions holds:
(a) there exists z ∈ D such that s1 = (2z, z2) and v is collinear with (1, z),

3.4. THE KOBAYASHI EXTREMAL PROBLEM Kob(δ) FOR G

11

(b) there exist β, z ∈ D such that s1 = (β + ¯βz, z) and v is collinear with ( ¯β, 1).
Thus, according to Deﬁnition 3.4, δ is a royal datum in case (a) and a ﬂat datum
in case (b).
(ii) Now suppose that ρδ is not constant on T. Let δ = (s1, v). By the deﬁnition of
ρδ, for ω ∈ T,

ρδ(eit) = |Φeit (s1, v)|2 = |(Φeit (s1), DvΦeit (s1))|2 = |DvΦeit (s1)|2

(1 − |Φeit (s1)|2)2 .

It is clear that the function t 7→ ρδ(eit) is smooth and 2π-periodic, and so attains
its maximum over [0, 2π) at some point t0, which is a critical point satisfying

d2

dt2 ρδ(eit)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=t0 ≤ 0.

By Theorem A.13, ρδ attains its supremum over T at either one or two points.
In the former case δ is either purely unbalanced or exceptional, and in the latter
case δ is purely balanced. We have shown that, for any nondegenerate inﬁnitesimal
datum δ in G, at least one of (1) to (5) is true.

Conditions (1), (2) and (3) are clearly mutually exclusive. Moreover, since they
together correspond to ρδ being nonconstant on T, they are inconsistent with (4)
and (5). It remains to show that δ cannot be both ﬂat and royal. If it is, then there
exists z ∈ D such that

s1 = (2z, z2) and v is collinear with (1, z),

and there exists β ∈ D such that

s1 = (β + ¯βz2, z2) and v is collinear with ( ¯β, 1).

Thus (1, z) is collinear with ( ¯β, 1), and so 1 = ¯βz, which is impossible for z, β ∈ D.
Hence a nondegenerate inﬁnitesimal datum cannot be both royal and ﬂat. We have
shown that exactly one of the cases (1) to (5) obtains for δ.
(cid:3)

We shall have more to say about the above classiﬁcation scheme of datums us-
ing the relation (3.5). Later, in Theorem 7.1 we shall give necessary and suﬃcient
geometrical conditions for a datum to be one of the ﬁve types in Deﬁnition 3.4. Ad-
ditionally, the balanced/unbalanced dichotomy is characterized in geometric terms
in Section 8 (Theorem 7.1 below).

Let δ be a datum in G. Observe that if C solves Car(δ), then, as automorphisms
of D act as isometries in the pseudohyperbolic metric, m ◦ C also solves Car(δ).
Thus the solution to Car(δ) is never unique. This motivates the following deﬁnition.

Definition 3.5. If δ is a nondegenerate datum in G, we say that the solution
to Car(δ) is essentially unique, if whenever C1 and C2 solve Car(δ) there exists
m ∈ Aut D such that C2 = m ◦ C1.

3.4. The Kobayashi extremal problem Kob(δ) for G

Let δ be a datum in G. Just as solutions to Car(δ) are never unique, nor are
solutions to Kob(δ): if m ∈ Aut D and f solves Kob(δ), then f ◦ m solves Kob(δ).
This suggests the following analog of Deﬁnition 3.5.

Definition 3.6. If δ is a nondegenerate datum in a domain U , we say that the
solution to Kob(δ) is essentially unique, if, whenever f1 and f2 solve Kob(δ), there
exists m ∈ Aut D of D such that f2 = f1 ◦ m.

12

3. EXTREMAL PROBLEMS IN THE SYMMETRIZED BIDISC G

It is easy to see that if U is strictly convex and the boundary of U is smooth
then the solution of any Kobayashi extremal problem in U is essentially unique
[32, Proposition 11.3.3]. On the other hand, if U is merely assumed to be convex,
it does not follow that Kobayashi extremals are essentially unique – witness the
example U = D2. It is noteworthy that for G, despite its non-convexity, solutions
of Kobayashi problems are nevertheless essentially unique. For discrete datums,
the following result is contained in [6, Theorem 0.3]. For inﬁnitesimal datums it is
proved in the appendix – see Theorem A.10.

Theorem 3.7. If δ is a nondegenerate datum in G then the solution to Kob(δ)

is essentially unique.

Remark 3.8. This theorem implies that if, for some nondegenerate datum δ
in G, two solutions to Kob(δ) agree at some nondegenerate datum in D then they
coincide.

CHAPTER 4

Complex geodesics in G

In Section 4.1 we establish some facts required for the proof of Theorem 7.1.
We begin with some generalities.
In the present context it is convenient to use
the term ‘geodesic’ to denote a set, rather than a holomorphic map on D (as for
example in [34]). For the latter notion we reserve the term ‘complex C-geodesic’.

4.1. Complex geodesics and datums in G

Definition 4.1. Let U be a domain and let D ⊂ U . We say that D is a
complex geodesic in U if there exists a function k ∈ U (D) and a function C ∈ D(U )
such that C ◦ k = idD and D = k(D).

Kobayashi [34, Chapter 4, Section 6], following [46], deﬁnes a complex C-
geodesic in a domain U to be a map k ∈ U (D) such that, for every nondegenerate
datum ζ in D,

|k(ζ)|car = |ζ|.

It follows easily from the Schwarz-Pick Lemma that k ∈ U (D) is a complex C-
geodesic if and only if k has a holomorphic left inverse. Thus a map k is a complex
C-geodesic if and only if k(D) is a complex geodesic in the sense of Deﬁnition 4.11.
A notable advance in the hyperbolic geometry of domains in Cn was the seminal
theorem of Lempert [36] to the eﬀect that the Carath´eodory and Kobayashi metrics
agree on any bounded convex domain U : | · |kob = | · |car in U . It implies that if δ
is a nondegenerate datum in a bounded convex domain U ⊆ Cn, then there exists
a solution C to Car(δ) and a solution k to Kob(δ) such that

(4.1)

C ◦ k = idD.

This result guarantees a plentiful supply of complex geodesics in bounded convex
domains.

The relationship between datums in U and complex geodesics in U can be

cleanly described using the notion of contact.

Definition 4.2. Let U be a domain, let V be a subset of U and let δ be a

datum in U . Then δ contacts V if either
(1) δ = (s1, s2) is discrete and s1 ∈ V and s2 ∈ V , or
(2) δ = (s, v) is inﬁnitesimal and either v = 0 and s ∈ V , or there exist two
sequences of points {sn} and {tn} in V such that sn 6= tn for all n, sn → s,
tn → s and

for some unit vector v0 collinear with v.

tn − sn
ktn − snk → v0,

1Kobayashi also uses the term ‘complex geodesic’, in a sense which diﬀers slightly from ours,

though the diﬀerence is not signiﬁcant for the domains studied in this paper.

4. COMPLEX GEODESICS IN G

Remark 4.3. If a datum δ in U contacts a set V ⊆ U , then, for any holomorphic
map F on U , the value of F (δ) only depends on F|V . It is obvious for discrete δ
and for the inﬁnitesimal datum δ = (s, 0). Consider a nondegenerate inﬁnitesimal
datum δ = (s, v) that contacts a subset V of U . Then there exist two sequences of
points {sn} and {tn} in V such that sn 6= tn for all n, sn → s,

tn → s and

and so, for any domain Ω and F ∈ Ω(U ),

F (s) = lim
n→∞

F (sn)

and DvF (s) = lim
n→∞

Thus F (δ) is determined by F|V .

F (tn) − F (sn)

ktn − snk

.

The notion of contact permits Lempert’s discovery to be expressed in the fol-

lowing geometric fashion:

For every nondegenerate datum δ in a bounded convex domain U there is a

complex geodesic in U that contacts δ.

The following proposition relates the concept of contact to holomorphic maps

on D.

Proposition 4.4. Let U be a domain in Cn.

(1) If f ∈ U (D) and ζ is a datum in D then f (ζ) contacts f (D);
(2) if k is a complex C-geodesic in U and δ is a datum in U that contacts k(D),

then there exists a datum ζ in D such that δ = k(ζ).

Proof. (1) The statement is trivial for discrete datums. Let ζ = (z, v) be an
inﬁnitesimal datum in D. If f ′(z)v = 0 then f (ζ) = (f (z), 0), which contacts f (D).
Consider the case that f ′(z)v 6= 0. Let
v,

un = z +

vn = z +

v.

2n

For n a suﬃciently large integer, un and vn are in D, and we may deﬁne sn =
f (un), tn = f (vn) in U . Clearly sn → f (z), tn → f (z). Since

sn − tn =

1
2n

f ′(z)v + o(1/n)

and f ′(z)v is nonzero, sn 6= tn for suﬃciently large n, and
(2n)−1f ′(z)v + o( 1

f ′(z)v

which is collinear with f ′(z)v. Thus f (ζ) contacts f (D).

(2) Let k be a complex C-geodesic. Then k has a left inverse C ∈ D(U ). Let

V = k(D). We have

k ◦ C|V = idU|V

4.2. UNIQUENESS OF COMPLEX GEODESICS FOR EACH DATUM IN G

15

Since δ contacts V , by Remark 4.3,

(k ◦ C)(δ) = idU (δ) = δ.

Let ζ = C(δ). Then ζ is a datum in D and, by equation (3.1), k(ζ) = δ.

(cid:3)

4.2. Uniqueness of complex geodesics for each datum in G

An important fact in the function theory of G is that Lempert’s conclusion
(| · |kob = | · |car) holds for G, even though G does not satisfy any of the various
convexity hypotheses of versions of Lempert’s theorem: G is not convex (nor even
biholomorphic to a convex domain [23]).

Theorem 4.5. For any datum δ in G, |δ|kob = |δ|car.
For discrete datums this is [5, Corollary 5.7]. In fact, since G is taut, it follows
that equality also holds for inﬁnitesimal datums [32, Proposition 11.1.7]. See also
[32, Theorem 7.1.16].

The following property of G plays a fundamental role in this paper.

Theorem 4.6. For every nondegenerate datum δ in G there exists a unique
complex geodesic D in G such that δ contacts D. Moreover D = k(D) where k
solves Kob(δ).

Proof. Let δ be a nondegenerate datum in G. Let k solve Kob(δ) and C solve

Car(δ). Then there exists a datum ζ in D such that k(ζ) = δ and

|ζ| = |δ|kob = |δ|car = |C(δ)| > 0.

Thus C◦k ∈ D(D) and |C◦k(ζ)| = |ζ|. By the Schwarz-Pick Lemma, C◦k ∈ Aut D.
Let D = k(D). Then D is a complex geodesic in G and δ = k(ζ) contacts D as
desired.
To prove uniqueness, let D′ be any complex geodesic of G that is contacted by
δ. By Deﬁnition 4.1 there exists h ∈ G(D) and F ∈ D(G) such that F ◦ h = idD
and D′ = h(D). Since δ contacts h(D), by Proposition 4.4, there exists a datum ζ′
in D such that h(ζ′) = δ. Since F ◦ h = idD we have |ζ′| = |δ| = |ζ|, and so h, k are
both solutions of Kob(δ). By Theorem 3.7, h = k ◦ m for some m ∈ Aut D. Thus
D′ = h(D) = k(D) = D.

(cid:3)

As a consequence of Theorem 4.6 we may unambiguously attach to each datum

in G a unique complex geodesic.

Definition 4.7. For any nondegenerate datum δ in G the unique complex

geodesic in G that is contacted by δ is denoted by Dδ.

Let us recall some notions and results from [10]. The closure of G in C2 will

be denoted by Γ; thus

The distinguished boundary of Γ is denoted by bΓ.

Γ = {(z + w, zw) : z, w ∈ D−}.

Definition 4.8. A rational Γ-inner function is a rational analytic map h :
D → Γ with the property that h maps T into the distinguished boundary bΓ of Γ.

16

4. COMPLEX GEODESICS IN G

All complex C-geodesics in G are rational Γ-inner functions (Theorem A.7).
For any rational Γ-inner function h, the second component h2 is a ﬁnite Blaschke
product. The degree deg(h) is equal to the degree of h2 (in the usual sense). The
following notion will play an important role.

Definition 4.9. Let h be a rational Γ-inner function. A royal node of h is a
point λ ∈ D− such that h(λ) ∈ R−. A royal point of h is a point of h(D−) ∩ R−.
The following result is [10, Theorem 1.1]. Observe that λ ∈ D− is a royal node

of h if and only if h1(λ)2 = 4h2(λ).

Theorem 4.10. If h is a nonconstant rational Γ-inner function then either

h(D−) = R− or h has exactly deg(h) royal nodes, counted with multiplicity.

Here multiplicity is deﬁned as follows.
Definition 4.11. Let h be a rational Γ inner function. If σ is a zero of (h1)2 −

4h2 of order ℓ, we deﬁne the multiplicity #σ of σ (as a royal node of h) by

#σ = 


ℓ

1
2 ℓ

if σ ∈ D
if σ ∈ T.

Lemma 4.12. Let δ be a nondegenerate datum in G, let k solve Kob(δ) and
suppose that k2 is a Blaschke product of degree 2. Let ω ∈ T. The following
conditions are equivalent:

(i) ω is a maximiser of ρδ on T;
(ii) (2¯ω, ¯ω2) is in k(D)− ∩ ∂R;
(iii) Φω solves Car(δ).
Proof. By the deﬁnition of ρδ, (i) ⇔ (iii).
(ii) ⇒ (i). Since k2 is a Blaschke product of degree 2, by Theorem A.6, Φω ◦ k
Choose a datum ζ ∈ D such that k(ζ) = δ and |ζ| = |δ|kob. By the Schwarz-Pick

has exactly one cancellation at τ , and so it is a M¨obius function.

Lemma,

Therefore

|Φω ◦ k(ζ)| = |ζ|.

Thus Φω solves Car(δ), and so ω is a maximiser of ρδ on T.

|Φω(δ)| = |Φω ◦ k(ζ)| = |ζ| = |δ|kob = |δ|car.

(iii) ⇒ (ii). Let Φω solve Car(δ). Then Φω ◦ k ∈ Aut D has degree one. Thus

Φω ◦ k =

2ωk2 − k1
2 − ωk1

has a cancellation at τ . By Theorem A.6, τ ∈ T, τ is a royal node for k and
k(τ ) = (2¯ω, ¯ω2). Therefore (2¯ω, ¯ω2) is in k(D)− ∩ ∂R.

(cid:3)

Proposition 4.13. Let k be a rational Γ-inner function of degree 2. Then k

is a complex C-geodesic of G if and only if k has a royal node in T.

Proof. Let k be a complex C-geodesic, so that k has a holomorphic left inverse
C. Pick a nondegenerate datum ζ in D. By Proposition 3.1, k solves Kob(δ), where
δ = k(ζ). Let ω be a maximizer of ρδ in T. By Lemma 4.12, there exists z ∈ T
such that k(z) = (2¯ω, ¯ω2). Then z is a royal node of k in T.

4.3. FLAT C-GEODESICS

17

Conversely, suppose that k has a royal node z ∈ T, so that k(z) = (2¯ω, ¯ω2) for
some ω ∈ T. By Lemma 4.12, Φω solves Car(δ). Since | · |kob = | · |car, it follows
that Φω is a holomorphic left inverse of k modulo Aut D. Hence k is a complex
C-geodesic of G.
(cid:3)

4.3. Flat C-geodesics

The symmetrized bidisc has the remarkable property that it is foliated by the
ranges of its complex C-geodesics of degree one. For any β ∈ D we introduce the
function fβ : D → C2 given by
(4.2)

fβ(z) = (β + ¯βz, z)

and the set

(4.3)

Fβ = fβ(D) = {(β + ¯βz, z) : z ∈ D}.

Proposition 4.14. For any β ∈ D the map fβ is a complex C-geodesic of G.
Proof. By Proposition A.1, fβ maps D into G. Thus fβ ∈ G(D), and clearly
fβ has a holomorphic left inverse, to wit the co-ordinate function s2. Hence fβ is a
complex C-geodesic of G.
(cid:3)

It follows of course that Fβ is a complex geodesic of G.
The following proposition implies that G is foliated by the ﬂat geodesics Fβ, β ∈

D, in G. The proof is a simple calculation.

Proposition 4.15. If s ∈ G then there is a unique β ∈ D such that s ∈ Fβ.

Moreover β is given by

β =

s1 − ¯s1s2
1 − |s2|2 .

The fact that β so deﬁned lies in D is contained in Proposition A.1.

Proposition 4.16. The following statements are equivalent for a complex C-

geodesic k of G.
(1) deg(k) = 1;
(2) k = fβ ◦ m for some β ∈ D and m ∈ Aut D;
(3) k(D) is the intersection of G with a complex line.

Proof. (1)⇔(2) The complex C-geodesics of G are explicitly described in
[6, 41]: they are Γ-inner functions of degree one or two, and those of degree one
are precisely of the form in (2).
(2)⇒(3) is trivial. Conversely, suppose that k(D) is the intersection of a complex
line with G. Let ω ∈ T be such that Φω is a left inverse of k. Then m def= Φω ◦ k ∈
Aut D. By Propositions A.7 and A.8, k2 is a non-constant Blaschke product, ϕ say,
of degree 1 or 2, and

(4.4)
Since k(D) lies in a complex line we can write k = (a + bϕ, ϕ) for some a, b ∈ C.
Moreover the relation (4.4) implies that b = ¯a. Hence

on T.

k1 = k1k2

(4.5)

k = (a + ¯aϕ, ϕ).

18

4. COMPLEX GEODESICS IN G

Since ϕ is nonconstant it has a zero z0 in D. Since k(z0) = (a, 0) and k(z0) ∈ G,
we have a ∈ D. Diﬀerentiate the identity

(2ωϕ − a − ¯aϕ)(z) = m(z)(2 − ωa − ω¯aϕ(z))

and substitute z = z0 to show that ϕ′(z0) 6= 0 and thus that z0 is a simple zero of
ϕ. Hence ϕ has degree 1 and so ϕ ∈ Aut D. Equation (4.5) shows that statement
(2) holds.

(cid:3)

In the light of Proposition 4.16 we shall call any complex C-geodesic of degree
one a ﬂat C-geodesic of G. There is no conﬂict with the notion of ﬂat datum, as
introduced in Deﬁnition 3.4, for the following reason.

Proposition 4.17. A nondegenerate datum δ in G is a ﬂat datum if and only

if there is a ﬂat C-geodesic k that solves Kob(δ).

Proof. Suppose that δ is a ﬂat datum. Since ρδ is constant on T, Theorems
A.14 and A.15 imply that δ contacts either R or Fβ for some β ∈ D. In the former
case the function C(s) = 1
2 s1 solves Car(δ), which implies that the datum δ is both
royal and ﬂat, contrary to the Pentachotomy Theorem. Hence δ contacts Fβ, and
the ﬂat C-geodesic k = fβ solves Kob(δ).
Conversely, suppose that fβ ◦ m solves Kob(δ) for some β ∈ D, m ∈ Aut D;
then so does fβ. Since C ◦ fβ = idD, where C(s) = s2, it follows that C solves
Car(δ). A simple calculation shows that, for any ω ∈ T,

Φω ◦ fβ = mω

for some mω ∈ Aut D.

Since δ contacts fβ(D), by Proposition 4.4, δ = fβ(ζ) for some nondegenerate
datum ζ in D. We have, in view of the deﬁnition (3.4),

ρδ(ω) = |Φω(δ)|2 = |Φω ◦ fβ(ζ)|2 = |mω(ζ)|2 = |ζ|2.

Hence ρδ is constant on T. Thus δ is a ﬂat datum.

(cid:3)

CHAPTER 5

The retracts of G and the bidisc D2

As was observed in the introduction, there are inclusions between the collec-
tions of complex geodesics, holomorphic retracts and sets with the norm-preserving
extension property in a general domain. In this chapter we prove Theorem 1.3, to
the eﬀect that the nontrivial retracts in G are the complex geodesics. By way of
a digression, we show that a similar geometric argument can be used to establish
the (known) description of the retracts in D2. Furthermore, we show by an explicit
construction that complex geodesics in G are zero sets of polynomials of degree at
most 2.

5.1. Retracts and geodesics of G

Let U be a domain. We say that ρ is a retraction of U if ρ ∈ U (U ) and ρ◦ρ = ρ.
A set R ⊆ U is a retract in U if there exists a retraction ρ of U such that R = ran ρ.
We say that a retraction ρ and the corresponding retract R are trivial if either ρ is
constant (and R is a singleton set) or ρ = idU (and R = U ).

A particularly simple way that a nontrivial retraction can arise is if C ∈ D(U ),
k ∈ U (D) and C ◦ k = idD. In that event, if we set ρ = k ◦ C, then ρ ∈ U (U ) and
(5.1)

ρ ◦ ρ = (k ◦ C) ◦ (k ◦ C) = k ◦ (C ◦ k) ◦ C = k ◦ idD ◦ C = k ◦ C = ρ.

Therefore, if U has dimension greater than one, ρ is a nontrivial retraction and the
complex geodesic ran k = ran ρ is a nontrivial retract. Thus, on general domains in
dimension greater than one, complex geodesics are nontrivial retracts. The question
arises: for which domains is the converse of this statement true? See for example
[28, 33]. It is true for the symmetrized bidisc.

Theorem 5.1. A map ρ ∈ G(G) is a nontrivial retraction of G if and only if
ρ = k ◦ C for some C ∈ D(G) and k ∈ G(D) such that C ◦ k = idD. Thus R is a
nontrivial retract in G if and only if R is a complex geodesic in G.

Proof. Let ρ be a retraction of G that is neither constant nor idG and let
R = ran ρ. As ρ is not constant, there exists a pair s1, s2 of distinct points in ρ(G).
Let δ be the nondegenerate discrete datum (s1, s2) in G.

Choose a datum ζ in D and k ∈ G(D) such that k solves Kob(δ) and k(ζ) = δ.
Since ρ|R is the identity, ρ(δ) = δ, and so both k and ρ ◦ k solve Kob(δ). Moreover
k(ζ) = δ = ρ ◦ k(ζ). By Remark 3.8, ρ ◦ k = k. Therefore

Dδ = k(D) = ρ ◦ k(D) ⊆ R.

If Dδ 6= R then there exists t ∈ R \ Dδ. By the argument in the foregoing
paragraph, for any s ∈ Dδ, the complex geodesic through t and s is contained in

def= D(t,s1) and
R, that is, D(t,s) ⊆ R. In particular, as s1 6= s2, the geodesics D1
def= D(t,s2) are contained in R. Furthermore, Theorem 4.6 implies that D1 6= D2.
D2
Choose kj to solve Kob(t, sj) and a vector vj tangent to Dj, j = 1, 2 at t. Since
D1 6= D2, it follows from Theorem 4.6 that v1, v2 are not collinear. Since ρ acts as
the identity map on R,

Dρ(t)vj = vj,

j = 1, 2.

Hence Dρ(t) is an invertible linear transformation. By the Inverse Function Theo-
rem ρ(G) contains a neighborhood of t in C2. Since ρ is the identity on its range, ρ
agrees with idG on a nonempty open set. Thus ρ = idG, contrary to our assumption.
Hence R = Dδ.
(cid:3)

5.2. Retracts of D2

The argument used in the preceding section to characterize retractions in G
applies in any domain U in C2 with the property that, for every nondegenerate
datum δ in U , the solution to Kob(δ) is essentially unique. The bidisc does not
have this property, but nevertheless, a variant of the argument is eﬀective. We shall
exploit the fact that, for datums λ in D2, the solution of Kob(λ) is not essentially
unique precisely when the solution of Car(λ) is essentially unique. Thereby we shall
obtain known results on retractions of D2 (see [28, 27, 33]) by simple geometric
methods.

Incidentally, the implications of uniqueness and nonuniqueness of solutions of
Carath´eodory and Kobayashi problems in many domains (including G) are explored
in [35].

Definition 5.2. Let λ = (λ1, λ2) be a nondegenerate discrete datum in D2.

Then λ is balanced, of type 1 or of type 2 according as

|(λ1

1, λ1

2)| = |(λ2

1, λ2

2)|,

1, λ1

|(λ1

2)| > |(λ2

1, λ2

2)| or |(λ1

1, λ1

2)| < |(λ2

1, λ2
2)|

respectively. λ is unbalanced if λ is of type 1 or type 2.

If λ is a balanced datum in D2 then the unique geodesic in D2 that contacts
λ is a balanced disc in the sense of Deﬁnition 8.3. It is not hard to see that, for
the nondegenerate datum λ = (λ1, λ2) in D2, the Kobayashi extremal problem
Kob(λ) has an essentially unique solution if and only if λ is balanced, whereas the
Carath´eodory extremal problem Car(λ) has an essentially unique solution if and
only if λ is unbalanced.

Theorem 5.3. A subset R of D2 is a nontrivial retract in D2 if and only if R

is a complex geodesic in D2.

Proof. Since R is assumed to be nontrivial, in particular R is not a singleton.

Choose points λ1, λ2 ∈ R with λ1 6= λ2.
If λ = (λ1, λ2) is balanced, then by [2, page 293] the solution to Kob(λ) is
essentially unique. It then follows by the argument in the preceding section that
R = k(D) where k solves Kob(λ).

Now assume that λ is not balanced, say

Let ρ be a retraction of D2 with ρ(D2) = R. Let f1, f2 : D2 → D be the ﬁrst

5.2. RETRACTS OF D2

Carath´eodory problem on D2, the inequality (5.2) shows that f1 solves Car(λ).
Since λ contacts R and ρ|R is the identity map, it is clear that f1 ◦ ρ also solves
Car(λ). By the essential uniqueness of solutions of Car(λ), there exists m ∈ Aut D
such that f1 ◦ ρ = m ◦ f1. Apply this equation to the points λ1, λ2 ∈ R to obtain
the equations

The relation (5.2) shows that λ1

2, and thus m ﬁxes a pair of distinct points in

(5.3)

on D2. Thus ρ has the form

f1 ◦ ρ = f1

ρ(λ) = (λ1, ϕ(λ))

for some ϕ ∈ D(D2). Consequently, if for each ﬁxed α ∈ D we deﬁne ϕα ∈ D(D) by
the formula,

w ∈ D.
For any z ∈ D2, the equation ρ ◦ ρ = ρ yields the relation

ϕα(w) = ϕ(α, w),

ρ(z1, ϕ(z)) = (z1, ϕ(z)).

Hence

(5.4)

z ∈ D2.
We claim that ϕα is a retraction of D. Indeed, for w ∈ D,

ϕ(z) = ϕ(z1, ϕ(z)),

ϕα(ϕα(w)) = ϕ(α, ρ2(α, w))

= ϕ(α, w)

(by equation (5.4))

= ϕα(w).

This proves that ϕα is a retraction of D for all α ∈ D.
Now retractions of D are either constant maps or idD. If there exists α0 ∈ D
such that ϕα0 = idD, then by continuity, ϕα = idD for all α in a neighborhood
of α0. But then ρ = idD, which contradicts the assumption that R is nontrivial.
Therefore, ϕα is constant for all α ∈ D.

For each α ∈ D, choose g(α) ∈ D where ϕα(w) = g(α) for all w ∈ D. Then

ρ(λ) = (λ1, ϕ(λ)) = (λ1, ϕλ1 (λ2)) = (λ1, g(λ1))

for all λ1 ∈ D. This proves that if we deﬁne k ∈ D2(D) by the formula k(w) =
(w, g(w)), w ∈ D, then

R = ran ρ = ran k.

If λ is not balanced and |(λ2

Since in addition, f1 ◦ k = idD, it follows that R is a geodesic.

5. THE RETRACTS OF G AND THE BIDISC D2

5.3. Geodesics in G are varieties

The relation in equation (5.1) has another valuable application, namely to the
calculation of a quadratic polynomial that vanishes on a prescribed geodesic of G.

Theorem 5.4. For every complex geodesic D in G there exists a polynomial P

of total degree at most 2 such that D = {s ∈ G : P (s) = 0}.

If D is ﬂat then we may choose P (s) = s1 − β − ¯βs2 for some β ∈ D. The result

therefore follows from the following more detailed statement.

Proposition 5.5. Let δ be a nonﬂat nondegenerate datum in G, let ω ∈ T
be such that Φω solves Car(δ) and let k ∈ G(D) satisfy Φω ◦ k = idD. Then k2 is
expressible in the form

(5.5)

k2 =

q∼
q

for some polynomial q of degree 2 that does not vanish on D−, where q∼(z) =
z2q(1/¯z).

Let

(5.6)

P (s) = (2 − ωs1)2 ˜q ◦ Φω(s) − s2q ◦ Φω(s)

.

ω2s2 − 1

Then
(1) P is a polynomial of total degree 2 that vanishes on Dδ;
(2) P is irreducible;
(3) P (s) = (s2)2P (s1/s2, 1/s2) and
(4) Dδ = {s ∈ G : P (s) = 0}.

Proof. Proposition A.8 in the Appendix contains the statement that k2 is
expressible in the form (5.5) for some polynomial q of degree at most 2 that does
not vanish on D−. Since δ is not ﬂat, deg k2 = 2, which is to say that deg(q∼) = 2.

By equation (5.1), k◦ Φω is a retraction onto ran k = Dδ. Therefore, for s ∈ Dδ,

Writing k = (k1, k2) and s = (s1, s2), we obtain the equations

(k ◦ Φω)(s) = s.

(5.7)
for all s ∈ Dδ.

k1 ◦ Φω(s) = s1

and

k2 ◦ Φω(s) = s2

By Proposition A.8, k2(¯ω) = ¯ω2, and therefore

(5.8)

q∼(¯ω) = ¯ω2q(¯ω).

Substitute z = Φω(s) into equation (5.5) and use the second equation in (5.7) to
obtain

(5.9)
for all s ∈ Dδ. By virtue of equation (3.3), if Q∼ and Q are deﬁned by the formulas
Q(s) = (2 − ωs1)2q ◦ Φω(s),
(5.10) Q∼(s) = (2 − ωs1)2q∼ ◦ Φω(s)

q∼ ◦ Φω(s) = s2q ◦ Φω(s)

and

5.3. GEODESICS IN G ARE VARIETIES

23

then Q∼ and Q are quadratic polynomials in two variables, and equation (5.9)
becomes

Q∼(s) = s2Q(s)

(5.11)
Also, note that if s = (s1, ¯ω2) and s1 6= 2¯ω, then
2ω ¯ω2 − s1
2 − ωs1 = ¯ω,

Φω(s) =

so that equations (5.10) and (5.8) imply that

for all s ∈ Dδ.

(5.12)

Q∼(s) = (2 − ωs1)2q∼(¯ω) = (2 − ωs1)2 ¯ω2q(¯ω) = ¯ω2Q(s).

Equations (5.11) and (5.12) together imply that
Q∼(s) − s2Q(s)

(5.13)
is a polynomial that vanishes on both Dδ and {s : s2 = ¯ω2}. It follows that
(5.14)

Q∼(s) − s2Q(s)

P (s) =

ω2s2 − 1

is a well-deﬁned polynomial that vanishes on Dδ. From equation (5.14) one can
derive an explicit formula for P in terms of q:

(5.15)

P (s) = −q(¯ω)(s1)2 + 2q′(¯ω)s1s2 − 2q′′(0)(s2)2

+ 2q′(¯ω)s1 + 4(2 Re q(0) − q(¯ω))s2 − 2q′′(0).

Note that, by equation (5.8), q(¯ω) is real.

P has total degree 2, and so (1) holds.

(2) Suppose P is not irreducible. Since P has degree 2, the zero set of P is the
If Dδ is contained in only one of the complex lines
union of two complex lines.
then, by Proposition 4.16, δ is a ﬂat datum, contrary to hypothesis. Hence both
lines meet Dδ. Since Dδ is connected, Dδ contains the common point, k(z0) say,
of the two lines. Thus both lines have the complex tangent k′(z0) at k(z0), and so
the two lines coincide. Again Dδ is contained in a complex line, and so Proposition
4.16 applies again to show that δ is a ﬂat datum, contrary to hypothesis. Thus P
is irreducible.

(3) Note that, for any s ∈ G,

Φω  s1

s2! = 1/Φω(s).

Thus

By assumption, k ∈ G(D) satisﬁes Φω ◦ k = idD. We claim that, for each s ∈ G,

the equation k2 ◦ Φω(s) = s2 implies that k1 ◦ Φω(s) = s1. For every z ∈ D,

Hence

and, since k2 ◦ Φω(s) = s2, we have

2ωk2(z) − k1(z)

2 − ωk2(z)

= z.

2ωk2(Φω(s)) − k1(Φω(s))

2 − ωk2(Φω(s))

= Φω(s)

2ωs2 − k1(Φω(s))

= Φω(s).

2 − ωs2

This implies that

2ωs2 − k1(Φω(s)) = 2ωs2 − s1, and so k1 ◦ Φω(s) = s1.

Therefore

{s ∈ G : P (s) = 0} = {s ∈ G : k2 ◦ Φω(s) = s2}

Thus, by the equations (5.7), Dδ = {s ∈ G : P (s) = 0}.

(cid:3)

Lemma 5.6. Let δ be a balanced datum in G, let Φω1 and Φω2 solve Car(δ) with

ω1 6= ω2, and let k solve Kob(δ). Choose m1, m2 ∈ Aut D such that
m2 ◦ Φω2 ◦ k = idD,

m1 ◦ Φω1 ◦ k = idD

and then let C1 and C2 be deﬁned by

Proof. Simply observe that

(2 − ω1s1)(2 − ω2s1)(C1(s) − C2(s))
is a quadratic polynomial that vanishes on ran k and that
ran k = Dδ = {s ∈ G : Pδ(s) = 0}.

CHAPTER 6

Purely unbalanced and exceptional datums in G

The most delicate part in the geometric characterization of types of datum in
Theorem 7.1 below is the distinction between purely unbalanced and exceptional
datums, depending as it does on whether or not a certain second derivative is zero.
In this chapter we calculate the relevant second derivatives.

Let us recall the following elegant parametrization of solutions to Kob(δ) due

to Pﬂug and Zwonek [41, Theorem 2 part (ii)].

Proposition 6.1. Let δ be a nondegenerate datum in G and assume that Dδ ∩

R = ∅. If k solves Kob(δ) then there exist m1, m2 ∈ Aut D such that
(6.1)

k = (m1 + m2, m1m2).

Proof. Let k solve Kob(δ), so that there is a datum ζ in D such that k(ζ) = δ

δ ∩ R− is the singleton set {(2¯ω0, ¯ω2
dt2 ρδ(eit)(cid:12)(cid:12)eit=ω0
and |ζ| = |δ|kob. Then k(D) = Dδ, k(D−) = D−
Since k has no royal nodes in D, by Proposition 6.1, k = (m1 + m2, m1m2)
for some m1, m2 ∈ Aut D. Replace k by k ◦ m−1
1 : then we may write k(z) =
(z + m(z), zm(z)), where m = cBα for some c ∈ T and α ∈ D. Consider any royal
node τ ∈ D− of k. The royal nodes of k are the ﬁxed points of m in D−, and so,
since k(τ ) ∈ E,

δ and Φω0 solves Car(δ).

k(τ ) = (2τ, τ 2) = (2¯ω0, ¯ω2

0).

Thus τ = ¯ω0. Hence k has the unique royal node ¯ω0, and so m has the unique ﬁxed
point ¯ω0, and this ﬁxed point lies in T.

It is elementary that, for the function m = cBα,

and

(1) m has a unique ﬁxed point which lies in T if and only if c 6= 1 and |α| = 1
(2) m has two ﬁxed points which lie in T if and only if |α| > 1
For our chosen m, alternative (1) holds, and so |α| = 1
since |rα| > 1
easily seen to be

For 1 ≤ r < |α|−1 let mr = cBrα. Then mr ∈ Aut D and m1 = m. For r > 1,
2|1 − c|, mr has two ﬁxed points lying in T. These ﬁxed points are

These two ﬁxed points are distinct when r > 1 and coincide with τ when r = 1.

Let

kr(z) = (z + mr(z), zmr(z))

(6.4)
for z ∈ D, 1 ≤ r < |α|−1. Then kr is a rational Γ-inner function of degree 2 having
royal nodes τ±(r) ∈ T. Since k1
r have the same denominator, Φω ◦ kr is also
rational of degree at most 2, for any ω. Moreover, Φω◦kr is inner, by Proposition A.3
in the Appendix. When ω = τ±(r), the numerator and denominator of Φω ◦ kr(z)
both vanish at z = τ±(r). Thus cancellation occurs, and so Φτ±(r) ◦ kr has degree
1. Thus kr has the left inverse Φτ±(r) modulo Aut D, which is to say that kr is a
complex C-geodesic of G.

r and k2

Let δr = kr(ζ), 1 ≤ r < |α|−1. Then kr solves Kob(δr) and Φτ±(r) solves

Now |t0− t±(r)| and |t+(r)− t−(r)| are asymptotic to |τ − τ±(r)| and |τ+(r)− τ−(r)|
respectively as r → 1, and from equation (6.3) it is easy to see that all these
quantities are asymptotic to √r − 1. It follows that G′
r(−t0) → 0 as r → 1. Since
Gr → G1 with respect to the C1 norm, it follows that G′
1(−t0) = 0, as required. (cid:3)

We shall need the following calculation.
Lemma 6.3. If a datum δ in G contacts R then Φω(δ) is independent of ω ∈ T.
Proof. If δ is discrete it has the form (s1, s2) where sj = (2zj, z2
j ) for some
zj ∈ D, j = 1, 2. One then ﬁnds that Φω(δ) = (−z1,−z2) for all ω ∈ T. If δ is
inﬁnitesimal then δ = (s1, v) where s1 = (2z1, z2
1) for some z1 ∈ D and v = λ(1, z1)
for some λ 6= 0. A straightforward calculation (more details are in the proof of
Theorem A.15) yields

In either case, Φω(δ) does not depend on ω.

(6.8)

Φω ◦ ˜m = m1 ◦ Φ(m∨)−1(ω)

(6.9)

ρ ˜m(δ) = ρδ ◦ (m∨)−1.
If m(z) = cBα(z) then (m∨)−1(ω) = B− ¯α(cω).

Proof. The identity (6.8) is a matter of veriﬁcation. If ω1 = (m∨)−1(ω) then
ρ ˜m(δ)(ω) = |Φω ◦ ˜m(δ)|2 = |m1 ◦ Φω1(δ)|2 = |Φω1(δ)|2 = ρδ(ω1) = ρδ ◦ (m∨)−1(ω).

Lemma 6.6. If D is a complex geodesic in G such that

(6.15)

D− ∩ R− = {(0, 0), (2, 1)}

then D = kr(D) for some r ∈ (0, 1), where

(6.16)

kr(z) =

1

1 − rz

(2(1 − r)z, z(z − r))

for z ∈ D.

Proof. Let δ be a nondegenerate datum that contacts D and let k solve
Kob(δ). Then D = k(D). Since (0, 0) ∈ k(D) and (2, 1) ∈ k(D−) we may as-
sume (composing k with an automorphism of D if necessary) that k(0) = (0, 0) and
k(1) = (2, 1). By [41, Remark 2], k can be written in the form

k(λ) =

1

1 − ¯αλ(cid:0)2τ (1 − |α|)λ, τ 2λ(λ − α)(cid:1)

for some τ ∈ T and α ∈ D. Since k(1) = (2, 1) we have
τ 2(1 − α)

τ (1 − |α|)

It follows that 1 − |α| = |1 − α|, and so 0 ≤ α < 1 and τ = 1. Thus

k(λ) =

If α = 0 then k(D) = R, contrary to the hypothesis (6.15). Thus 0 < α < 1.

A geometric classiﬁcation of geodesics in G

All geodesics in a domain U are coequal for Euclidean geometry, in the sense
that they are all properly embedded analytic discs, and so conformally equivalent.
However they can diﬀer from the point of view of the intrinsic geometry of U . Say
two geodesics D1 and D2 are equivalent in U (written D1 ∼ D2) if there exists
an automorphism τ of U such that τ (D1) = D2.
In the case when U = B, the
unit ball in Cn, the group of automorphisms acts transitively on the set of complex
geodesics, and so there is a single equivalence class. In G, on the other hand, we
identify ﬁve distinct species of geodesic, and three of these ﬁve species consist of
one-parameter families of pairwise inequivalent geodesics (Theorem 7.8), while the
remaining two species comprise a single equivalence class.

In this chapter we prove a geometric characterization of the type of a datum δ
(in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.4) in terms of the intersection of the complex geodesic
Dδ with the royal variety (more precisely, with the intersection of the corresponding
closures). The result is Theorem 7.1. It has two important consequences: ﬁrstly, the
type of a datum is preserved by automorphisms of G (Corollary 7.2), and secondly,
if two datums contact the same geodesic then they have the same type (Corollary
7.3). The correspondence between nondegenerate datums and geodesics therefore
permits a classiﬁcation of geodesics too into ﬁve types. Recall the Pentachotomy
Theorem 3.6, which states that, for a nondegenerate datum δ in G, exactly one of
the cases (1) to (5) in Deﬁnition 3.4 holds.

The deﬁnitions of the ﬁve types of datum are not, at a ﬁrst glance, geometric
in character: it is not immediately apparent that types are preserved by automor-
phisms of G. However, the following theorem characterizes types of datums purely
in terms of the geometry of G.

unbalanced;

Theorem 7.1. Let δ be a nondegenerate datum in G and let E = D−

δ ∩ R−.
Then
(1) E consists of two points, one lying in R and one lying in ∂R ⇐⇒ δ is purely
(2) E consists of a single point that lies in ∂R ⇐⇒ δ is exceptional;
(3) E consists of two points, both lying in ∂R ⇐⇒ δ is purely balanced;
(4) E consists of a single point that lies in R ⇐⇒ δ is ﬂat;
(5) E = R− ⇐⇒ δ is royal.

Proof. By Theorem 4.6, there exists a solution k of Kob(δ) and Dδ = k(D).
By Theorem A.7, this k is a rational Γ-inner function and k2 is a Blaschke product
of degree 1 or 2. Since k is Γ-inner, k(T) ⊆ bΓ.
that is, once or twice, counted with multiplicity.

If k(D−) 6= R− ∩ Γ, by Theorem 4.10, k(D−) meets R− exactly deg(k) times,

37

38

7. A GEOMETRIC CLASSIFICATION OF GEODESICS IN G

(4) Suppose that E consists of a single point s1 = k(z1) that lies in R (thus in
G rather than ∂G). Now z1 is a simple zero of the rational function R = (k1)2− 4k2
in D. For suppose it has multiplicity greater than 1. By [10, Proposition 3.5], the
zeros of R are symmetric with respect to T, and it follows that R has at least
4 zeros lying oﬀ T. However, since deg(k) ≤ 2, R has degree at most 4, and so
deg(R) = 4, deg(k) = 2 and k has no royal nodes in T. This contradicts the fact
(see Proposition 4.13) that any complex C-geodesic of degree 2 has a royal node
in T. Hence z1 is the unique royal node of k and is simple. By Theorem 4.10, the
complex C-geodesic k has degree 1. Thus there is a ﬂat complex C-geodesic that
solves Kob(δ). By Proposition 4.17, δ is a ﬂat datum.

Conversely, suppose δ is a ﬂat datum. By Proposition 4.17, there is a ﬂat com-
plex C-geodesic, which has degree 1, that solves Kob(δ). By Theorem 4.10, k has
exactly one royal node, counted according to multiplicity. However, by Proposition
4.16, any ﬂat complex C-geodesic has the form fβ ◦ m for some β ∈ D, m ∈ Aut D
and so has a royal node in D, by Proposition 7.7. Hence k has a single royal node,
which lies in D, and so E consists of a single point that lies in R. The equivalence
(4) is proved.

(5) Suppose E = R−. Then R− = D−

δ = k(D−). Thus
the holomorphic function (k1)2 − 4k2 has uncountably many zeros in D, and so
vanishes identically. Thus Dδ = R, and so δ contacts R. By Lemma 6.3, Φω(δ)
is independent of ω. Thus ρδ is constant on T, and so δ is either ﬂat or royal.
However, by statement (4), δ is not ﬂat, and so δ is royal.

δ ∩ R− and so R− ⊆ D−

Conversely, suppose that δ is royal: ρδ is constant on T and C(s) = 1

2 s1 solves

Car(δ). Thus Φω solves Car(δ) for all ω ∈ T.
Deﬁne h ∈ G(D) by h(z) = (2z, z2). Then C ◦ h = idD. We claim that there
In the case that δ is discrete, say
exists a datum ζ in D such that h(ζ) = δ.
δ = (s1, s2), Theorem A.14 asserts that s1 and s2 either both lie in R or both
lie in {(β + ¯βz, z) : z ∈ D} for some β ∈ D. If the second alternative holds then
C1(s) = s2 is easily seen to solve Car(δ), and so δ is both ﬂat and royal, contrary
to Theorem 3.6. Thus s1, s2 both lie in R, so that s1 = h(z1), s2 = h(z2) for some
z1, z2 ∈ D. Hence δ = h(ζ) where ζ = (z1, z2).
In the case that δ is inﬁnitesimal, say δ = (s1, v), Theorem A.15 asserts that
either (a) there exists z1 ∈ D such that s1 = (2z1, z2
1) and v is collinear with (1, z1),
or (b) there exist β, z1 ∈ D such that s1 = (β + ¯βz1, z1) and v is collinear with
( ¯β, 1), say v = c( ¯β, 1), c 6= 0.
We claim that (b) does not hold. For suppose it does. Let η be the datum
(z1, c) in D and let C1(s) = s2. Then h(η) = δ and C1 ◦ h = idD. It follows that
C1 solves Car(δ), and therefore δ is both royal and ﬂat, again contrary to Theorem
3.6. Hence (a) holds. Now, if ζ is the datum (z1, 1

2 c) in D then h(ζ) = δ.

Thus, in either case, there is a datum ζ in D such that h(ζ) = δ. By Lemma
3.1, since C ◦ h = idD, it follows that h solves Kob(δ). Hence Dδ = h(D) = R, and
so E = R−. Thus the equivalence (5) holds.
If deg(k) = 1 then, as
is shown in the proof of (4) above, δ is ﬂat and hence E ∩ ∂R = ∅, contrary to
hypothesis. Thus deg(k) = 2. By Lemma 4.12, ρδ has exactly two maximizers in
T, which is to say that δ is purely balanced.

(3) Suppose E consists of two points, both in ∂R.

7. A GEOMETRIC CLASSIFICATION OF GEODESICS IN G

39

Conversely, suppose that δ is purely balanced, so that ρδ has exactly two max-
imizers, say ω1 6= ω2 in T. Then once again δ is not ﬂat and so deg(k) = 2. By
Lemma 4.12,

D−
δ ∩ ∂R = k(D)− ∩ ∂R = {(2¯ω1, ¯ω2

1), (2¯ω2, ¯ω2

2)}.

Hence E contains two distinct points in ∂R. Since k has exactly 2 royal nodes, by
Theorem 4.10, it follows that k has no royal points in G, and so E = {(2¯ω1, ¯ω2
Thus the equivalence (3) holds.

2)}.

(1) Suppose that E consists of two points, one in R and one, say (2¯ω0, ¯ω2
0),
in ∂R. By statement (4) above, δ is not ﬂat and hence, by Propositions 4.17 and
4.16, deg(k) = 2. By Lemma 4.12, ρδ has the unique maximizer ω0 in T, and by
Proposition 6.7,

(7.1)

d2

dt2 ρδ(eit)(cid:12)(cid:12)eit=ω0

< 0.

By deﬁnition, δ is purely unbalanced.

Conversely, suppose that δ is purely unbalanced, so that ρδ has a unique max-
imizer, say ω0 in T, and the inequality (7.1) holds. By Proposition 6.2, E 6=
{(2¯ω0, ¯ω2
0)}. Thus k has a second royal node z0 ∈ D− such that k(z0) 6= (2¯ω0, ¯ω2
0).
If z0 ∈ T then k(z0) ∈ ∂R and, by Lemma 4.12, ρδ has a second maximizer in T,
contrary to the assumption that δ is purely unbalanced. Hence z0 ∈ D, so that
k(z0) ∈ R. Thus E contains two points, one in R and one in ∂R. Since k has
at most two royal nodes, by Theorem 4.10, E consists of these two points. The
equivalence (1) is proved.

(2) Since deg(k) is one or two, by Theorem 4.10, either k(D) = R or k has
one or two royal nodes. There are thus ﬁve possibilities for E, as described in the
statements (1)-(5). Thus E consists of a single point lying in ∂R if and only if
E is not of the forms described in statements (1), (3), (4) and (5). Consequently
E consists of a single point lying in ∂R if and only if δ is not purely unbalanced,
purely balanced, ﬂat or royal, which in turn is so if and only if δ is exceptional, by
Theorem 3.6.

Corollary 7.2. The type of a datum in G is holomorphically invariant: if δ
is a nondegenerate datum in G and ˜m ∈ Aut G then δ and ˜m(δ) are of the same
type.

The statement is immediate from Theorem 7.1 and the fact that every au-
tomorphism ˜m of G extends continuously to a bijective self-map of Γ (Corollary
A.12).

Corollary 7.3. The type of a complex geodesic is unambiguously deﬁned: if
δ1, δ2 are nondegenerate datums in G and Dδ1 = Dδ2 then δ1 and δ2 have the same
type.

This statement too is clear from Theorem 7.1.
The following geometric characterization of balanced geodesics in G is an im-

mediate corollary of Theorem 7.1 and Deﬁnition 3.4.

Proposition 7.4. If δ is a nondegenerate datum in G, then δ is unbalanced
if and only if Dδ meets R in a single point. δ is balanced if and only if either
Dδ ∩ R = ∅ or Dδ = R.

7. A GEOMETRIC CLASSIFICATION OF GEODESICS IN G

In the light of Theorem 7.1, the terms ﬂat, exceptional, purely unbalanced,
purely balanced, and royal (as introduced in Deﬁnition 3.4) are all terms that refer
not only to qualitative properties of the Carath´eodory extremal problem associ-
ated with a given datum δ but also to geometric properties of the unique geodesic
associated with δ.

Definition 7.5. A geodesic D in G is said to be ﬂat, or of ﬂat type, if there is
a nondegenerate ﬂat datum δ in G such that D = Dδ. Analogous deﬁnitions apply
for exceptional, purely unbalanced, purely balanced and royal geodesics.

Proposition 7.6. The ﬂat geodesics in G are the sets Fβ (deﬁned in equation

(4.3)) for β ∈ D.

Proof. Let D be a ﬂat geodesic in G and let δ be a ﬂat datum such that
D = Dδ. By Proposition 4.17 there is a ﬂat C-geodesic k that solves Kob(δ), and
by Proposition 4.16, k = fβ ◦ m for some β ∈ D and m ∈ Aut D. Hence

D = Dδ = k(D) = fβ(D) = Fβ.

(cid:3)

Proposition 7.7. The closure of a ﬂat geodesic meets the closure of the royal

variety R− exactly once, and the common point lies in R.

Proof. Consider the ﬂat geodesic Fβ = fβ(D) where β ∈ D. The royal nodes

of fβ are the points z ∈ D− such that (β + ¯βz, z) ∈ R−, that is, such that
(7.2)
If β = 0 then the unique royal node of fβ is 0 and F −
0 ∩R− = {(0, 0)}. If β 6= 0 then
the equation (7.2) has two distinct roots in C which are symmetric with respect
to the unit circle. Hence there is no root in T and exactly one root in D. Thus
F −
β ∩ R− consists of a single point, which belongs to R.
(cid:3)

(β + ¯βz)2 = 4z.

The type of a complex geodesic is deﬁned in terms of solutions of the Carath´eodory

extremal problem. It follows, though, that every solution k of a Kobayashi problem
has a type, and one can ask for a characterization of types directly in terms of
the complex C-geodesic k ∈ G(D). Recall that two geodesics D1,D2 are equivalent
(written D1 ∼ D2) if there exists an automorphism ˜m of G such that ˜m(D1) = D2.

Theorem 7.8. Let D be a complex geodesic of G.

(1) D is purely unbalanced if and only if D ∼ kr(D) for some r ∈ (0, 1) where

kr(z) =

(2(1 − r)z, z(z − r))

for all z ∈ D;

1

1 − rz

(2) D is exceptional if and only if D ∼ hr(D) for some real number r > 0, where
(7.3)

hr(z) = (z + mr(z), zmr(z))

and

(7.4)

mr(z) =

(r − i)z + i
r + i − iz

for z ∈ D;

(3) D is purely balanced if D ∼ gr(D) for some r ∈ (0, 1), where
for all z ∈ D;

gr(z) = (z + Br(z), zBr(z))

(4) D is ﬂat if and only if D ∼ k(D) where k(z) = (0, z);

7. A GEOMETRIC CLASSIFICATION OF GEODESICS IN G

41

(5) D is royal if and only if D ∼ k(D) where k(z) = (2z, z2).
Moreover, in statements (1), (2) and (3), the corresponding geodesics are pairwise
inequivalent for distinct values of r in the given range.

Proof. (1) The royal nodes of kr are 0 and 1 and the corresponding royal
points are (0, 0) and (2, 1). Thus k(D)− ∩R− = {(0, 0), (2, 1)}. Hence, if D ∼ k(D)
then D− ∩ R− consists of a point in R and another in ∂R. By Theorem 7.1, D is
purely unbalanced.

Conversely, let D be purely unbalanced. By Theorem 7.1,

D− ∩ R− = {(2α, α2), (2τ, τ 2)}

for some α ∈ D and τ ∈ T. Choose m ∈ Aut D such that m(α) = 0 and m(τ ) = 1.
Then ˜m(D−) ∩ R− = {(0, 0), (2, 1)}. By Lemma 6.6, ˜m(D) = kr(D) for some
r ∈ (0, 1), and then D = ˜m−1(kr(D)) ∼ kr(D).
To prove pairwise inequivalence of the geodesics kr(D), 0 < r < 1, suppose
that kr(D) ∼ kr′(D) for some pair r, r′. Then there exists m1 ∈ Aut D such that
˜m1(kr(D)) = kr′(D). According to [34, Corollary 4.6.4], in a general domain Ω,
if f, g are complex C-geodesics in Ω having the same range then there is an au-
tomorphism α of Ω such that g = f ◦ α. Hence there exists m2 ∈ Aut D such
that

kr′ = ˜m1 ◦ kr ◦ m2.

Since ˜m−1
1 preserves the royal variety, m2 maps the royal nodes of kr′ to the royal
nodes of kr. These royal nodes are 0 and 1 for both functions, and so m2 leaves
both 0 and 1 ﬁxed. Hence m2 = idD and kr′ = ˜m1 ◦ kr. Similarly, ˜m1 maps the
royal points of kr′ to the royal points of kr, which implies that m1 also ﬁxes the
points 0 and 1, and so m1 = idD. Thus kr = kr′ , which easily implies that r = r′.
(2) We ﬁrst show that hr(D) is an exceptional geodesic for any r ∈ R \ {0}. Let

τ =

r − i
r + i

and

α = 1

2 (1 − ¯τ ).

Then τ ∈ T \ {−1, 1} and α ∈ D \ {0}, and we have mr = τ Bα ∈ Aut D.
Moreover, since |1 − τ| = 2|α|, it follows that the equation mr(z) = z has a
unique root in T, which is to say that hr has a unique royal point in ∂R, and no
royal points in R. By Theorem 3.7, hr(D) is an exceptional geodesic in G.
Conversely, suppose that D is an exceptional geodesic in G. By Theorem 7.1,
D− ∩ R− consists of a single point in ∂R, which we may take (replacing D by an
equivalent geodesic) to be (2, 1). Let k be a complex C-geodesic in G such that
D = k(D). Since D ∩ R = ∅, Proposition 6.1 implies that we can assume that
k(z) = (z + m(z), zm(z)) for some m ∈ Aut D, and since the royal points of this k
are the points (2z, z2) where z ∈ D− satisﬁes m(z) = z, we infer that m has the
unique ﬁxed point 1 in D−. Any such automorphism has the form m = τ Bα for
some α ∈ D \ {0} and τ ∈ T \ {−1, 1} such that 1 − τ = 2 ¯α.

Let

Then r ∈ R \ {0} and

r = i

1 − τ

α = 1

7. A GEOMETRIC CLASSIFICATION OF GEODESICS IN G

One may then verify that m = mr, and so k = hr for some r ∈ R \ {0}. Now

m−1

r (z) =

and

(r + i)z − i
r − i + iz

= m−r(z)

hr ◦ m−1(z) = (z + m−1

r (z), zm−1

r (z)) = h−r(z).

Suppose that hr(D) ∼ hr′(D) for some r, r′ > 0. We shall show that r = r′.

Thus, for any r ∈ R \ {0}, hr(D) = h−r(D). Hence D ∼ hr(D) for some r > 0.
The equivalence implies that there exist a1, a2 ∈ Aut D such that
(7.5)

hr′ = ˜a2 ◦ hr ◦ a1.

Since a1, ˜a2 ﬁx the common royal nodes and points respectively of hr, hr′, neces-
sarily a1(1) = 1 = a2(1).

Equation (7.5) can be written

(z + mr′(z), zmr′(z)) = ˜a2 ◦ (a1(z) + mr ◦ a1(z), a1(z)mr ◦ a1(z))

= (a2 ◦ a1(z) + a2 ◦ mr ◦ a1(z), (a2 ◦ a1(z)) (a2 ◦ mr ◦ a1(z)))

for all z ∈ D. It follows that, for every z, either

a2 ◦ a1(z) = z

and

a2 ◦ mr ◦ a1(z) = mr′ (z)

or

Therefore either

(7.6)

or

a2 ◦ a1(z) = mr′(z)

and

a2 ◦ mr ◦ a1(z) = z.

a2 ◦ a1 = idD

and

a2 ◦ mr ◦ a1 = mr′

and

a2 ◦ a1 = mr′

(7.7)
If the alternative (7.6) holds, then a2 = a−1
(7.8)
Let a1 = cBγ for some c ∈ T and γ ∈ D. Since a1(1) = 1,

mr ◦ a1 ◦ m−r′ = a1.

a2 ◦ mr ◦ a1 = idD.
1 and

c =

1 − ¯γ
1 − γ

.

In view of equation (7.8) we have mr ◦ a1 ◦ m−r′(γ) = 0, and therefore

a1 ◦ m−r′(γ) = −
On writing out this equation in detail we obtain

i
r − i

.

1 − ¯γ
1 − γ

(r′ + i − iγ)γ − i − γ(r′ − i)
(−¯γ(r′ + i) + i)γ + ¯γi + r′ − i

This equation simpliﬁes to r = r′.

= −

i
r − i

.

The remaining possibility is that the alternative (7.7) holds. In this case we

may write

m−r′ ◦ a2 ◦ a1 = idD,

m−r′ ◦ a2 ◦ mr ◦ a1 = m−r′.

Let b = m−r′ ◦ a2. Then the last equation becomes

b ◦ a1 = idD,

b ◦ mr ◦ a1 = m−r′.

7. A GEOMETRIC CLASSIFICATION OF GEODESICS IN G

43

Since m−r′ and a2 both ﬁx 1, so does the automorphism b, and we may therefore
apply the ﬁrst alternative, with a2 replaced by b, to deduce that r = −r′ Since
r, r′ > 0, this cannot happen. Thus the ﬁrst alternative (7.6) holds and r = r′.
(3) Suppose that D ∼ gr(D) for some r ∈ (0, 1). Since Br has the ﬁxed points 1 and
−1, gr has the royal nodes 1,−1 and g(D)− meets R− in the royal points (±2, 1).
By Theorem 7.1, g(D) and consequently D are purely balanced geodesics.
Conversely, suppose that D is purely balanced. By Theorem 7.1, D− ∩ R−
consists of a pair of points in ∂R, and we may take these points to be (2, 1) and
(−2, 1). Choose a complex C-geodesic k such that D = k(D). Since D ∩ R = ∅, by
Proposition 6.1 we can assume that k(z) = (z + m(z), zm(z)) for some m ∈ Aut D.
The ﬁxed points of m are the royal nodes of k, which are ±1. It follows that m = Br
and hence k = gr for some nonzero r ∈ (−1, 1). Since

gr ◦ B−r = g−r,
we conclude that D ∼ gr(D) for some r in (0, 1).

Suppose that gr(D) ∼ gr′(D). Then there exist a1, a2 ∈ Aut D such that

(7.9)
and moreover a1, a2 map the set {−1, 1} of royal nodes of gr and gr′ to itself. Hence
either a1 or −a1 ﬁxes both 1 and −1, and so a1 = ±Bγ for some γ ∈ (−1, 1). Then
a1(γ) = 0.

gr′ = ˜a2 ◦ gr ◦ a1,

It follows from equation (7.9) that either

a2 ◦ a1 = idD

and

a2 ◦ Br ◦ a1 = Br′

or

(7.10)
Consider the ﬁrst alternative. Then a2 = a−1

a2 ◦ a1 = Br′

and

a2 ◦ Br ◦ a1 = idD.
1 and B−r ◦ a1 = a1 ◦ B−r′. Since

B−r ◦ a1(γ) = B−r(0) = r,

we have

±Bγ ◦ B−r′(γ) = r.
Since r′ and γ are real, B−r′(γ) = B−γ(r′), and so

Since r, r′ > 0, we have r = r′.

r = ±Bγ ◦ B−γ(r′) = ±r′.

If the second alternative (7.10) holds, then

(B−r′ ◦ a2) ◦ a1 = idD

and

(B−r′ ◦ a2) ◦ Br ◦ a1 = B−r′,

and so, by the ﬁrst alternative, r = −r′. Again this contradicts r, r′ > 0, and so we
deduce that r = r′.

(cid:3)

Remark 7.9. By Deﬁnition 3.4, for a nondegenerate datum δ, there is a unique
solution of Car(δ) among the Φω if and only if δ is either purely unbalanced or
exceptional. Hence the complex C-geodesics kr and hr described in (1) and (2) of
Theorem 7.8 have unique holomorphic left inverses (modulo Aut D) of the form Φω.
In fact more is true: Kosi´nski and Zwonek [35, Theorem 5.3] show that the kr and
hr have unique holomorphic left inverses (modulo Aut D) of any form.

CHAPTER 8

Balanced geodesics in G

In studying sets V with the norm-preserving extension property in G we shall
exploit intersections of V with balanced and ﬂat geodesics. Recall that a datum is
deﬁned to be balanced if it is exceptional, purely balanced or royal. We shall say
that a complex geodesic is balanced if it is contacted by a nondegenerate balanced
datum.

One characterization of balanced datums is given in Proposition 7.4 above;
another is aﬀorded by Proposition 8.2 below. The following is a simple observation.

Lemma 8.1. Let δ be a nondegenerate datum in G and let k be a solution to

Kob(δ) such that

k = (m1 + m2, m1m2)

where m1, m2 ∈ Aut D. Then the royal nodes of k are the solutions of m1 = m2 in
D− and the roots of this equation in C are symmetric with respect to T.

Proposition 8.2. If δ is a nondegenerate datum in G and k is a solution to
Kob(δ), then δ is balanced if and only if k factors through the bidisc, that is, there
exists f ∈ D2(D) such that k = π ◦ f . Furthermore, if f = (m1, m2) and k = π ◦ f
then m1, m2 ∈ Aut D and exactly one of the following statements holds:
(1) m1 = m2 and δ is royal;
(2) the equation m1(z) = m2(z) has exactly two solutions in T and δ is purely

balanced;

(3) the equation m1(z) = m2(z) has exactly one solution in T (which is of multi-

plicity two) and δ is exceptional.

Proof. Fix a datum δ in G and a solution k to Kob(δ). Assume that δ is
balanced. By Theorem 7.1 either Dδ ∩ R = ∅ or Dδ = R. If Dδ = R, then there
exists m ∈ Aut D such that k(z) = (2m(z), m(z)2) = (π◦ f )(z) where f : D → D2 is
deﬁned by f (z) = (m(z), m(z)). If Dδ ∩R = ∅ then, by Proposition 6.1, there exist
m1, m2 ∈ Aut D such that k = π ◦ f where f is deﬁned by f (z) = (m1(z), m2(z)).
Thus, in either case, k factors through the bidisc.
To prove the converse, suppose that f ∈ D2(D) and k = π ◦ f but that δ is
not balanced, so that δ is either ﬂat or purely unbalanced. Since k is Γ-inner, the
components of f are inner.

If δ is ﬂat, then since C(s) = s2 solves Car(δ), C ◦ k ∈ Aut D. This implies
that f 1f 2 has degree 1. Since f 1 and f 2 are inner, it follows that either f 1 or f 2 is
constant. But then k = π ◦ f maps D into ∂G, contradicting the fact that k solves
Kob(δ).
If δ is purely unbalanced then deg f 1f 2 = deg k2 = 2. Hence, since the ar-
gument in the previous paragraph implies that neither f 1 nor f 2 is constant,
deg f 1 = deg f 2 = 1. Thus m1, m2 ∈ Aut D. By Theorem 7.1, k has one royal

45

46

8. BALANCED GEODESICS IN G

node in T and one in D. By Lemma 8.1, the quadratic equation m1 = m2 has a
root in D and another in T, and its roots are symmetric with respect to T. The
equation thus has at least 3 distinct roots, which implies that m1 and m2 coincide,
and so that δ is royal. This is a contradiction. Hence, if k factors through the bidisc
then δ is balanced.

Suppose now that δ is balanced and k = π ◦ (m1, m2), where m1, m2 ∈ D(D).
Since k is Γ-inner, m1 and m2 are inner, and degree considerations show that
m1, m2 ∈ Aut D. Thus k is a rational Γ-inner function of degree 2 and is a complex
C-geodesic of G. By Proposition 4.13, k has a royal node in T.
By Lemma 8.1, the royal nodes of k are the solutions of m1 = m2 in D− and
the roots of this equation in C are symmetric with respect to T. There are exactly
three possible cases for the roots of the quadratic equation m1 = m2, given that
there is a root in T.

By Theorem 7.1, δ is royal.

(1) There are inﬁnitely many roots. Then m1 coincides with m2 and k(D) = R.
(2) The equation m1 = m2 has exactly two solutions in T. Then k has exactly

two royal nodes in T. By Theorem 7.1, δ is purely balanced.

(3) The equation m1 = m2 has exactly one solution in T, which is of multiplicity
two. Then k has a unique royal node, which lies in ∂R. By Theorem 7.1, δ is
exceptional.

(cid:3)

The term ‘balanced’ in Deﬁnition 3.4 was suggested by a similar notion for the

bidisc.

Definition 8.3. A balanced disc in D2 is a set of the form {(w, m(w)) : w ∈ D}

for some m ∈ Aut D.

According to [2, Deﬁnition 1.17], a nondegenerate discrete datum λ = (λ1, λ2)
in D2 is said to be balanced if the hyperbolic distance between the ﬁrst co-ordinates
of λ1 and λ2 is equal to the hyperbolic distance between the second co-ordinates of
λ1 and λ2; otherwise λ is unbalanced. It was noted in [2] that, for a nondegenerate
discrete datum λ in D2, the solution to Kob(λ) is essentially unique if and only
if λ is balanced, and in that case the unique geodesic of D2 that contacts λ is a
balanced disc. Any geodesic in D2 of the form (m1, m2)(D), where m1, m2 ∈ Aut D
is a balanced disc. The following lifting property of certain geodesics in G will be
exploited in Section 9.

Proposition 8.4. Let δ be a nondegenerate datum in G that is either balanced

or ﬂat. There exists a balanced disc D in D2 such that Dδ = π(D).

Proof. Suppose that δ is a balanced datum. By Proposition 8.2, Dδ is of the
form π(D) where D = (m1, m2)(D) for some m1, m2 ∈ Aut D. This D is a balanced
disc in D2.

Consider the case of a ﬂat datum δ. Note that

{0} × D = F0

is a ﬂat geodesic. If D = {(z,−z) : z ∈ D} then D is a balanced disc in D2, and

π(D) = {(0,−z2) : z ∈ D} = F0.

Now consider the general ﬂat geodesic Fβ, where β ∈ D. According to Theorem
A.11, there exists m ∈ Aut D such that ˜m(F0) = Fβ, where ˜m is the automorphism

8. BALANCED GEODESICS IN G

47

of G given by

Let

˜m(z + w, zw) = (m(z) + m(w), m(z)m(w)).

Then Dm is a balanced disc in D2, and

Dm = {(m(z), m(−z)) : z ∈ D}.

π(Dm) = {(m(z) + m(−z), m(z)m(−z)) : z ∈ D} = ˜m(π(D)) = ˜m(F0) = Fβ.

(cid:3)

Note that the image under π of a balanced datum in D2 need not be a balanced

datum in G – it can be ﬂat.

CHAPTER 9

Geodesics and sets V with the norm-preserving

extension property in G

We say that a set A ⊆ C2 is an algebraic set if there exists a set S of polynomials

in two variables such that

A = {λ ∈ C2 : p(λ) = 0 for all p ∈ S}.

We say that a set V ⊆ C2 is an algebraic set in G if there exists an algebraic set A
in C2 such that V = A∩ G. If V is an algebraic set in G and f is a complex valued
function deﬁned on V , then we say that f is holomorphic on V if f can be locally
extended to a holomorphic function on C2, that is, if for each λ ∈ V there exists a
neighborhood U of λ in C2 and a holomorphic function F deﬁned on U such that
F (µ) = f (µ) for all µ ∈ V ∩ U .
We recall Deﬁnition 1.2 from the introduction: a subset V of G has the norm-
preserving extension property if every bounded holomorphic function f on V has
a holomorphic extension to G of the same supremum norm. An immediate conse-
quence of the deﬁnition is the following.

Proposition 9.1. Any subset of G that has the norm-preserving extension

property is connected.

Proof. If not, choose two distinct components V1 and V2 of V . The norm-
preserving extension property of V ensures the existence of a function F ∈ C(G)
such that supG |F| = 1, F = 0 on V1 and F = 1 on V2, contrary to the Maximum
Principle.

(cid:3)

The following is a slight strengthening of an observation in the introduction.

Proposition 9.2. If R is a retract in G then R is an algebraic set in G having

the norm-preserving extension property.

Proof. By Theorem 5.1 R is a geodesic. Hence, by Proposition 5.5, R is an
algebraic set. If ρ is a retraction of G with range R and f is a bounded holomorphic
function on V then f ◦ ρ is a holomorphic extension of f to G with the same
supremum norm as f .

(cid:3)

We initially hoped to prove the converse of Proposition 9.2 for G. After all,
in the bidisc it is true that sets with the norm-preserving extension property are
retracts [2]. However, it transpires that there are algebraic sets with the norm-
preserving extension property in G which are not retracts; we call them anomalous
sets. They are described in Lemma 9.10 below.

This chapter investigates some of the geometric consequences of the norm-
preserving extension property. The argument will eventually culminate in Lemma
11.2, to the eﬀect that if V is an algebraic set in G that has the norm-preserving

49

50

9. GEODESICS AND SETS V WITH THE EXTENSION PROPERTY

extension property and if V is not anomalous then V is a properly embedded ﬁnitely
connected Riemann surface.

9.1. V and Car(δ)

In this section we prove a technical result about solutions of the Carath´eodory
problem for datums that contact a set V having the norm-preserving extension
property.

Lemma 9.3. Let w0 ∈ D and let D = {z ∈ D :

|z − w0| > r} for some r
such that 0 < r < 1 − |w0|. For any nondegenerate datum δ in D there exists a
holomorphic map β : D → D such that
(9.1)

|β(δ)|D > |δ|.

We use the notation | · |D to emphasize that β(δ) is being regarded as a datum

in D.

Proof. We can assume that w0 = 0. Consider ﬁrst the case of a nondegenerate
discrete datum δ = (z1, z2). We shall choose t > 0 and g ∈ C(D) such that
g(z1) = g(z2) = 0 and the function z − tg(z) maps D into a disc of radius R < 1;
then the function

will have the desired properties.

β(z) = R−1(z − tg(z))

Let

ε =

1

2(1 + |z1|)(1 + |z2|)

.

Consider the Laurent expansion of the rational function z/((z − z1)(z − z2)), which
is analytic in an annulus containing T. A suitable partial sum of the expansion is
a rational function h ∈ C(D) such that
(9.2)

< ε

h(z) −

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

z

(z − z1)(z − z2)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

for all z ∈ T, and the only poles of h are at 0 and ∞. Let
(9.3)
g is analytic in D and g(z1) = g(z2) = 0. Multiply the inequality (9.2) by |(z −
z1)(z − z2)| to deduce that, for z ∈ T,

g(z) = (z − z1)(z − z2)h(z)

for z ∈ D−.

|¯zg(z) − 1| < ε sup

|z|=1|(z − z1)(z − z2)|

Hence, for z ∈ T,

≤ ε(1 + |z1|)(1 + |z2|)
= 1
2 .

Re(¯zg(z)) > 1
2 .

Consequently, for z ∈ T,

(9.4)

|z − tg(z)|2 = 1 − 2t Re(¯zg(z)) + t2|g(z)|2

< 1 − t + t2 sup

T |g|2.

Let M = sup|z|=r |g(z)|. For |z| = r we have

|z − tg(z)| ≤ r + tM.

9.2. V AND BALANCED DATUMS

51

Hence we can choose R ∈ (0, 1) and t so small that |z − tg(z)| < R < 1 for all z in
both the inner and outer bounding circles of D, and so, by the Maximum Principle,
for all z in D. Consideration of the points z1, z2 shows that R > max{|z1|,|z2|},
and it follows that

|β(δ)|D = |(β(z1), β(z2))| =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:16) z1

R

,

z2

R(cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

> |(z1, z2)| = |δ|.

Now consider the nondegenerate inﬁnitesimal datum (z1; 1) in D. The proof
is similar: construct t > 0 and g ∈ C(D) such that g(z1) = g′(z1) = 0 and the
function z − tg(z) maps D into a disc of radius R < 1. The rest of the construction
is as in the discrete case, with z2 = z1.

(cid:3)

Lemma 9.4. Let V ⊆ G have the norm-preserving extension property and let δ
be a nondegenerate datum in G that contacts V . If C is a solution to Car(δ) then
C(V ) is dense in D.

Proof. Let C be a solution to Car(δ) and let ζ = C(δ). If C(V ) is not dense
in D then there exist w0 ∈ D and r satisfying 0 < r < 1 − |w0| such that if D is
deﬁned to be {z ∈ D : |z − w0| > r}, then C(V ) ⊆ D and ζ is a nondegenerate
datum in D. By Lemma 9.3 there exists a holomorphic map β : D → D such that
|β(ζ)| > |ζ|. The map f0 = β ◦ (C|V ) is well deﬁned and holomorphic from V to
D. Consequently, since V has the norm-preserving extension property, there exists
a holomorphic map F : G → D− satisfying F|V = f0. By the Open Mapping
Theorem, F (G) ⊂ D, and so F is a candidate for Car(δ). But C is a solution to
Car(δ) and

|F (δ)| = |f0(δ)|

by Remark 4.3

by equation (3.1)

= |(β ◦ C)(δ)|
= |(β(C(δ))|
= |β(ζ)|
> |ζ|
= |C(δ)|
= |δ|car.

This contradiction shows that C(V ) is dense in D.

(cid:3)

Remark 9.5. The above proof remains valid if V , rather than being assumed

to be an algebraic set, is only assumed to be relatively polynomially convex.

9.2. V and balanced datums

Here is another technical result concerning datums that contact a set with the

norm-preserving extension property.

Lemma 9.6. Let V be an algebraic set in G that has the norm-preserving exten-
sion property. Let δ be a nondegenerate datum in G such that there exist distinct
points ω1, ω2 ∈ T for which Φω1, Φω2 solve Car(δ) (so that δ is either ﬂat, royal or
purely balanced). If δ contacts V then Dδ ⊆ V .

Proof. Pick ω1, ω2 ∈ T where ω1 6= ω2 and Φω1 and Φω2 both solve Car(δ).

Fix any solution k to Kob(δ), choose m1, m2 ∈ Aut D such that

m1 ◦ Φω1 ◦ k = idD

and

m2 ◦ Φω2 ◦ k = idD,

52

9. GEODESICS AND SETS V WITH THE EXTENSION PROPERTY

and then let C1 and C2 be deﬁned by

C1 = m1 ◦ Φω1

and

C2 = m2 ◦ Φω2;

C1 ◦ k = idD = C2 ◦ k.

then

Deﬁne C by

C = 1

2 C1 + 1

2 C2.

Claim 9.7. If τ ∈ T, τ 6= C2(2¯ω1, ¯ω2

δ ∩ V − such that s0 6= (2¯ω1, ¯ω2

s0 ∈ D−

1), and τ 6= C1(2¯ω2, ¯ω2

C1(s0) = C2(s0) = τ.

2), then there exists

1), C1(2¯ω2, ¯ω2

To prove this claim, ﬁx τ ∈ T \ {C2(2¯ω1, ¯ω2

2)}. By construction,
C solves Car(δ). Therefore, by Lemma 9.4 there exists a sequence of points {sn}
in V such that C(sn) → τ . Passing to a subsequence if necessary we may further
assume that sn → s0 ∈ ∂G. Since C(sn) → τ , it follows that both C1(sn) → τ
and C2(sn) → τ . But then C1(sn) − C2(sn) → 0. Consequently, by Lemma 5.6, it
follows that Pδ(sn) → 0. Since Pδ is continuous, it follows that Pδ(s0) = 0, that is,
that s0 ∈ D−
δ ∩ V −.
1). Since
C2 = m2 ◦ Φω2 is continuous on a neighborhood of (2¯ω1, ¯ω2

δ . Since it is also the case that s0 ∈ V −, it follows that s0 ∈ D−
1), assume to the contrary that s0 = (2¯ω1, ¯ω2
1), it follows that

To see that s0 6= (2¯ω1, ¯ω2

C2(2¯ω1, ¯ω2

1) = C2(s0) = lim
n→∞

C2(sn) = τ,

contradicting the assumption that τ 6= C2(2¯ω1, ¯ω2
similar fashion. This completes the proof of Claim 9.7.

1). That s0 6= (2¯ω2, ¯ω2

2) follows in

Now ﬁx τ ∈ T with τ 6= C2(2¯ω1, ¯ω2

1) and τ 6= C1(2¯ω2, ¯ω2

2). Let s0 be as in the

claim. Since s0 ∈ D−

δ , there exists η ∈ T such that s0 = k(η). But then
τ = C1(s0) = C1(k(η)) = (C1 ◦ k)(η) = η,

so that

This proves that

k(τ ) = k(η) = s0 ∈ V −.

k(T \ {C2(2¯ω1, ¯ω2

1), C1(2¯ω2, ¯ω2

2)}) ⊆ V −.

By continuity, k(T) ⊆ V −. Since V is algebraic there is a set S of polynomials such
that

V = G ∩ {s : p(s) = 0 for all p ∈ S}.

Hence p ◦ k = 0 on T for all p ∈ S, and by the Maximum Principle, p ◦ k = 0 on D
for all p ∈ S. Thus Dδ = k(D) ⊆ V , as was to be proved.

(cid:3)

9.3. V and ﬂat or royal datums

In this section we show that if a set V having the norm-preserving extension
property contacts either a ﬂat datum or a royal datum then V has one of three
concrete forms. To do this we ﬁrst prove a result about the closest point in G to a
ﬂat or royal geodesic.

Lemma 9.8. Let δ be a nondegenerate datum in G such that Φω solves Car(δ)

(ii) there are at least two values of ω ∈ T such that Φω solves Car((s0, t)) (so
(iii) if Dδ is ﬂat and t ∈ R then s0 ∈ R.
Proof. (i) Let k solve Kob(δ) and let ω1 ∈ T be such that Φω1 ◦ k = idD. The

function ϕ on Dδ deﬁned by

ϕ(s) = |(s, t)|car

is continuous and ran ϕ ⊆ (0, 1). Note that
ϕ(s) = |(s, t)|car = sup

Let w1 = Φω1(t) and let s = k(z), z ∈ D. We have

It is clear that ϕ(s) → 1 as s → ∂G in Dδ. Hence the function ˜ϕ deﬁned by

is continuous on the closure Dδ of Dδ in G, and ran ˜ϕ ⊆ (0, 1]. Note that k(D−) =
Dδ, and so Dδ is compact. Hence ˜ϕ attains its inﬁmum at some point s0 ∈ Dδ. It
is clear that s0 is not in k(T), since ˜ϕ(D) ⊆ (0, 1) and | ˜ϕ(s)| = 1 for all s ∈ k(T).
Thus s0 ∈ Dδ.

(ii) Suppose that there exists a unique ω0 ∈ T such that

ω∈T|Φω((s0, t))| = |(s0, t)|car.

Let k be a solution to Kob(δ) and let s0 = k(z0).

Since δ is assumed to be ﬂat or royal, for each ω ∈ T, Φω ◦ k is in Aut D and

therefore has no critical points. For any direction w ∈ C,

|B ◦ Φω0 ◦ k(z0)| = |B ◦ Φω0(s0)| = |(s0, t)|car 6= 0.

Since, further, B′ and (Φω0 ◦ k)′ are never zero on D,

(B ◦ Φω0 ◦ k)′(z0)B ◦ Φω0 ◦ k(z0) 6= 0.

By equation (9.9), there is some direction w0 such that Dw0|Φω0 ((k(z), t))|2(cid:12)(cid:12)z=z0

For x ∈ [−π, π] and y in some suﬃciently small neighborhood I of 0, let

Claim 9.9. There is a sequence (xj) in [−π, π] such that, for each j, f (x, yj)

Indeed, suppose not. Choose, for each j, any point xj at which f (x, yj) attains
its maximum over [−π, π], then pass to a subsequence such that xj converges to
some point x0. By supposition, x0 6= 0, and so eix0 ω0 6= ω0. We have k(z0+yjw0) →

Thus ω1 = eix0 ω0 is a second value of ω for which Φω solves Car((s0, t)), contrary

The function f has the following properties.

∂y (0, 0) = 1;

(1) f is real analytic on [−π, π] × I;
(2) ∂f
(3) f (x, 0) has a unique global maximum over [−π, π], which is at x = 0.
Consider the power series expansion of f about (0, 0). In view of statement (3)
there exists n ≥ 1 and ρ > 0 such that

we may assume that Dδ is the ﬂat geodesic F0 = {(0, z) : z ∈ D}. This is because
the automorphisms of G ﬁx R, permute the ﬂat geodesics (by Proposition A.11)
and preserve the Carath´eodory distance. We claim that (0, 0) is the closest point
in F0 to t.

Lemma 9.10. Let V be an algebraic set in G having the norm-preserving ex-
tension property. If δ is a ﬂat datum in G that contacts V then either V = Dδ,
V = R ∪ Dδ or V = G.

Proof. extlem40 Since δ contacts V , it follows from Lemma 9.6 that Dδ ⊆ V .
Suppose that V 6= Dδ. Then there exists a point v0 ∈ V such that v0 /∈ Dδ.
Consider two cases: (1) v0 /∈ R, and (2) v0 ∈ R.
Case (1): v0 /∈ R. By Lemma 9.8 there exists a point s0 ∈ Dδ which is the
closest point of Dδ to v0 and a pair ω1, ω2 of distinct points in T such that both
Φω1 and Φω2 solve Car(γ), where γ = (s0, v0). According to Deﬁnition 3.4 the
datum γ is either ﬂat, purely balanced or royal. Now γ is not royal, since v0 /∈ R.
Nor is γ ﬂat; indeed, if γ is ﬂat, then Dγ and Dδ are ﬂat geodesics through s0 and
hence coincide, contrary to the fact that v0 ∈ Dγ \ Dδ. Hence γ is purely balanced,
which is to say that there are exactly two values of ω for which Φω solves Car(γ).
Consequently, by Lemma 9.6, Dγ ⊆ V . Corollary 8.4 now implies that there is a
balanced disc D in the bidisc such that π(D) = Dγ.
Consider the case that Dδ is the ﬂat geodesic given by equation (4.2) with
β = 0, that is,

Dδ = F0 = {(0, z) : z ∈ D}.

By inspection,

where B is the balanced disc in D2 given by

Dδ = π(B)

B = {(z,−z) : z ∈ D}.

(9.13)
Let λ0 = (z0,−z0) ∈ B be such that π(λ0) = s0. We can assume that also
λ0 ∈ D, for certainly D contains one of the (at most two) points of π−1(s0), and
we may replace D by the balanced disc {(λ2, λ1) : (λ1, λ2) ∈ D} if necessary. Thus
λ0 ∈ D ∩ B.
Choose µ0 ∈ D such that π(µ0) = v0. Since v0 /∈ R, µ0 does not lie in the
diagonal set ∆ in D2, deﬁned by ∆ = {(z, z) : z ∈ D}. Since λ0, µ0 belong to the
balanced disc D in D2,

|(z0, µ1

0)| = |(−z0, µ2

0)| = |(z0,−µ2

0)|.

The locus of points z ∈ D such that
|(z, µ1

0)| = |(z,−µ2
0)|

9.3. V AND FLAT OR ROYAL DATUMS

57

is a geodesic (zt)t∈R through z0 in the Poincar´e disc (this statement is obvious if
0 = r, µ2
µ1
0 = −r for some r > 0, and the general case follows upon application of
a suitable automorphism of D). Thus

|(zt, µ1

0)| = |(zt,−µ2

0)| = |(−zt, µ2

0)|.

Let λt = (zt,−zt). Then (λt) is a curve in B such that (λt, µ0) is a balanced pair
for all t. Let the unique geodesic of D2 passing through λt and µ0 be Dt (see the
comment preceding Corollary 8.4). Dt is the balanced disc having the form

(9.14)

Dt = {(w, mt(w)) : w ∈ D}
where mt is the unique automorphism of D such that

mt(µ1

0) = µ2
0

(9.15)
Clearly mt depends continuously on t ∈ R.
the intersection contains a point ν 6= µ0. Then, for some w1, w2 ∈ D,

We claim that if t1 6= t2 then Dt1 ∩ Dt2 = {µ0}. Suppose, to the contrary, that

and mt(zt) = −zt.

(w1, mt1(w1)) = ν = (w2, mt2 (w2)) 6= µ0.

Thus w1 = w2 and so

mt1(w1) = mt2 (w1)

If w1 6= µ1

0. That is, mt1(µ1

0 or mt1(w1) 6= µ2
0.

0 and mt1(w1) 6= µ2

and either w1 6= µ1
0 then mt1, mt2 are automorphisms of D taking the same values at
the distinct points w1 and µ1
0. Hence mt1 = mt2 and so Dt1 = Dt2. Thus Dt1 is a
balanced disc containing the two distinct points λt1 , λt2 . The balanced disc B also
contains these two points, and so, by uniqueness, Dt1 = B. It follows that µ0 ∈ B,
and so, by application of π, we have v0 ∈ Dδ, a contradiction. We deduce that
w1 = µ1
0, contrary to equation (9.15).
Hence Dt1 ∩ Dt2 = {µ0}.
D0 = D. Hence π(D0) = Dγ and so
(9.16)
Now D0 = {(w, m0(w)) : w ∈ D}. By Proposition 6.1, m0 has two distinct ﬁxed
points in T. It follows that there is a neighborhood I of 0 in R such that mt has two
distinct ﬁxed points in T for all t ∈ I. Then, for t ∈ I, π(Dt) is a purely balanced
geodesic in G containing the distinct points v0 = π(µ0) and π(λt), both of which
belong to V . Hence

Since D is the balanced disc in D2 containing λ0 and µ0, again by uniqueness,

π(D0) is a purely balanced geodesic in G.

0) 6= µ2

π(Dt) = Dδt where δt = (v0, π(λt)).

The nondegenerate discrete datum δt contacts V . By Lemma 9.6, Dδt ⊆ V for all
t ∈ I.
Now, since λt ∈ B, we have π(λt) ∈ F0 ∩ Dδt for all t ∈ R. Hence, for t ∈ I
and β in a neighborhood N of zero,

Fβ meets Dδt

(9.17)
Since v0 /∈ F0, we may ensure (replacing N by a smaller neighborhood of 0 if
necessary) that v0 /∈ Fβ for all β ∈ N . Since Dδt = π(Dt), statement (9.17) implies
that there exists λβt ∈ Dt \{µ0} such that π(λβt) ∈ Fβ ∩Dδt ⊆ V for β ∈ N, t ∈ I.
Since distinct Dts meet only at µ0, for ﬁxed β ∈ N , the points λβt, t ∈ I, are

and Dδt ⊂ V.

58

9. GEODESICS AND SETS V WITH THE EXTENSION PROPERTY

pairwise distinct. Since each point of G has at most two preimages in D2 under π,
it follows that the set {π(λβt) : t ∈ I} is an uncountable subset of Fβ ∩ V .
We can now show that V = G. Suppose that p is a polynomial that vanishes on
V . Then, for β ∈ N , p vanishes at the uncountably many points π(λβt), t ∈ I, in
the one-dimensional disc Fβ, and hence p|Fβ = 0. Since the union of the discs Fβ,
for β ∈ N , is a neighborhood of zero in C2, we have p = 0. Thus every polynomial
that vanishes on V is the zero polynomial. Therefore, since V is an algebraic set in
G, V = G.

We have shown that V = G in the case that Dδ is the ﬂat geodesic F0. If Dδ
is the ﬂat geodesic Fβ, for some β ∈ D, then the same conclusion can be deduced
from the case β = 0 by the application of an automorphism of G, with the aid of
Theorem A.11 in the Appendix. This concludes the proof of the lemma in Case
(1).

Case (2): v0 ∈ R. By Lemma 9.8(ii) the closest point s0 to v0 in Dδ lies in R.
Hence the nondegenerate discrete datum γ = (s0, v0) is royal and contacts V . By
Lemma 9.6, Dγ ⊆ V , that is, R ⊆ V . Hence R ∪ Dδ ⊆ V .

If V 6= R∪Dδ then there exists a point v1 ∈ V \ (R∪Dδ). By Case (1), V = G.
We have shown that, if V 6= Dδ, then in Case (1) V = G and in Case (2) either

V = R ∪ Dδ or V = G.

(cid:3)

Lemma 9.11. Let V be an algebraic set in G having the norm-preserving ex-
tension property. If a royal datum contacts V then either V = R, V = R ∪ Dδ for
some ﬂat datum δ or V = G.

Proof. By Lemma 9.6, R ⊆ V . Suppose that V 6= R. There exists a point
t0 ∈ V \R. By Lemma 9.8 there is a point s0 ∈ R such that the datum δ = (s0, t0)
is either ﬂat, royal or purely balanced. Since t0 /∈ R, δ is not royal. Neither is δ
purely balanced, because Dδ meets R at the point s0 ∈ G, and Theorem 7.1(4)
applies. Hence δ is ﬂat. Again by Lemma 9.6, Dδ ⊆ V . Hence, by Lemma 9.10,
either V = R ∪ Dδ or V = G.

(cid:3)

CHAPTER 10

Anomalous sets R ∪ D with the norm-preserving

extension property in G

Lemmas 9.10 and 9.11 imply that, among sets that contact a ﬂat or royal datum,
the only possible anomalous algebraic sets having the norm-preserving extension
property are sets of the form R∪D for some ﬂat complex geodesic D. This chapter
will be devoted to the proof that such sets do indeed have the norm-preserving
extension property.

Theorem 10.1. If

for some ﬂat geodesic D of G then V has the norm-preserving extension property.
Section 10.1 contains a number of deﬁnitions and lemmas to be used in the

V = R ∪ D

proof of Theorem 10.1 and the proof of the theorem is executed in Section 10.2.

10.1. Deﬁnitions and lemmas

Definition 10.2. Let U be a domain and assume that V ⊆ U . We say that
a function f : V → C is Herglotz on V if f is analytic on V and Re f (s) > 0 for
all s ∈ V . We say that V has the Herglotz-preserving extension property if every
function f that is Herglotz on V has an extension to a function that is Herglotz on
U .

Lemma 10.3. Let U be a domain and assume that V ⊆ U . Then V has the
Herglotz-preserving extension property if and only if V has the norm-preserving
extension property.

Proof. The formula

ϕ(z) =

1 + z
1 − z

deﬁnes a conformal automorphism of the Riemann sphere which maps D onto the
right halfplane {w ∈ C : Re w > 0}. Consequently, if V ⊆ U and f is an analytic
function on V , then

f is Herglotz on V ⇐⇒ |ϕ−1 ◦ f (s)| < 1 for all s ∈ V.

Since this statement holds when V = U as well, the lemma follows immediately. (cid:3)

Definition 10.4. If f is a complex valued function on R ∪ F0 we deﬁne func-

tions on D by the formulas

(10.1)

fF (z) = f (0, z)

and

fR(z) = f (2z, z2).

60

10. ANOMALOUS SETS WITH THE EXTENSION PROPERTY

Lemma 10.5. Let f be a complex valued function deﬁned on R∪F0. Then f is
analytic on R ∪ F0 if and only if fF and fR are analytic on D and fF (0) = fR(0).
Proof. Clearly, if f is analytic on R ∪ F0, then fF and fR are analytic on D

and fF (0) = fR(0). Conversely, assume that fF and fR are analytic on D and

fF (0) = η = fR(0).

It is immediate from the ﬁrst formula in (10.1) that f is analytic at each point
s = (0, z) ∈ F0 \ {(0, 0)}. Likewise, the second formula in (10.1) implies that f
is analytic at each point s = (2z, z2) ∈ R \ {(0, 0)}. To see that f is analytic at
s = (0, 0), deﬁne F by the formula

F (s) = fR(cid:0) 1

2 s1(cid:1) + fF(cid:0)s2 − 1

and observe that F is a holomorphic extension of f to a neighborhood of (0, 0). (cid:3)

if

s = (0, z) ∈ F0,

Lemma 10.7. The function fτ is analytic on R ∪ F0 for any τ ∈ T2. Further-

more, if a complex-valued function Ψτ is deﬁned on G by the formula

(10.2)
where ω = −¯τ2τ1, then Ψτ is a norm-preserving analytic extension of fτ to G.

Ψτ (s) = −τ2Φω(s),

s ∈ G,

Proof. By Lemma 10.5 fτ is analytic on R ∪ F0 and, clearly,

s∈R∪F0 |f (s)| = 1.

Also, as Φω is a Carath´eodory extremal function on G,
s∈G|Φω(s)| = 1.

s∈G|Ψτ (s)| = sup

It is a simple to show from Deﬁnition 3.2 that fτ = Ψτ|(R ∪ F0). This fact also
implies that fτ is analytic on R ∪ F0.

Lemma 10.8 (A Herglotz Representation Theorem for R ∪ F0). A function
h : R ∪ F0 → C is a Herglotz function on R ∪ F0 satisfying h(0, 0) = 1 if and only
if there exists a probability measure µ on T2 such that

(10.4)

for all s ∈ R ∪ F0.

h(s) =ZT2

1 + fτ (s)
1 − fτ (s)

dµ(τ )

Proof. Lemma 10.7 asserts that fτ is analytic on R ∪ F0 for each τ ∈ T2.

Consequently, as supR∪F0 |fτ| ≤ 1 and fτ (0, 0) = 0, it follows that the function

s 7→

1 + fτ (s)
1 − fτ (s)

,

s ∈ R ∪ F0,

is a Herglotz function on R∪ F0 that assumes the value 1 at (0, 0) for each τ ∈ T2.
Hence, if h is deﬁned by equation (10.4), then h is Herglotz function on R ∪ F0
satisfying h(0, 0) = 1.
Now assume that h is a Herglotz function on R ∪ F0 satisfying h(0, 0) = 1. By
Lemma 10.5 it follows that the functions hF and hR are analytic on D. In addition

10.2. THE PROOF OF THE NORM-PRESERVING EXTENSION PROPERTY FOR R ∪ D 61

hF (0) = 1, hF (0) = 1, and both hF and hR have positive real part on D. Therefore,
by the classical Herglotz Representation Theorem there exist probability measures
(i.e. ﬁnite positive Borel measures with total variation 1) µF and µR on T such
that

(10.5)

and

(10.6)

hF (z) =Zτ1∈T

dµF (τ1)

1 + τ2z
1 − τ2z

dµR(τ2)

for all z ∈ D. We deﬁne a probability measure µ on T2 by dµ(τ ) = dµF (τ1)dµR(τ2).
Observe that if s = (0, z) ∈ F0, then Deﬁnition 10.4 and formula (10.5) imply
that

h(s) = hF (z) =Zτ1∈T

1 + τ1z
1 − τ1z

dµF (τ1).

Therefore, since µR has total variation 1, Fubini’s Theorem implies that

h(s) =Zτ2∈T

h(s) dµR(τ2)

=Zτ2∈T(cid:16)Zτ1∈T

But since s = (0, z) ∈ F0,

where fτ is as in Deﬁnition 10.6. Therefore, equation (10.4) holds when s ∈ F0.
If s = (2z, z2) ∈ R, then by repeating the argument in the previous paragraph
using the representation (10.6) for hR one shows that equation (10.4) holds when
s ∈ R as well.
(cid:3)
10.2. The proof of the norm-preserving extension property for R ∪ D
We ﬁrst observe that Theorem A.11 guarantees that the group of automor-
phisms of G acts transitively on the ﬂat geodesics in G and ﬁxes R. Therefore, it
suﬃces to prove Theorem 10.1 in the special case when D = F0.
Observe next that Lemma 10.3 implies that it suﬃces to prove that R∪F0 has
the Herglotz-preserving extension property. However, if U is a general domain, V
is a subset of U , and f is a Herglotz function on V , then

h =

f − i Im f (0, 0)

Re f (0, 0)

is a Herglotz function on V satisfying h(0, 0) = 1. Therefore, as

f = (Re f (0, 0))h + i Im f (0, 0),

to establish the Herglotz-preserving extension property for V , it suﬃces to show
that every Herglotz function h on V satisfying h(0, 0) = 1 has a Herglotz extension

62

10. ANOMALOUS SETS WITH THE EXTENSION PROPERTY

to U . Hence, the proof of Theorem 10.1 will be complete if we can show that every
Herglotz function h on R∪F0 satisfying h(0, 0) = 1 has a Herglotz extension to G.
Fix a Herglotz function h on R ∪ F0 satisfying h(0, 0) = 1. By Lemma 10.8
there exists a probability measure on T2 such that equation (10.4) holds. Deﬁne a
function g on G by the formula

(10.7)

g(s) =Zτ ∈T2

1 + Ψτ (s)
1 − Ψτ (s)

dµ(τ )

where for each τ ∈ T2, Ψτ is the function deﬁned by the formula (10.2).
First, note that Ψτ is analytic on G for each τ ∈ T2 and that τ 7→ Ψτ is a
continuous map from T into C(G) (endowed with the topology of locally uniform
convergence). Therefore,

(10.8)

g is a well deﬁned analytic function on G.

Next, note that since equation (10.3) implies that, for each τ ∈ T2,

Re

1 + Ψτ (s)
1 − Ψτ (s)

> 0

for all s ∈ G, and µ is a probability measure, necessarily the function g deﬁned in
equation (10.7) satisﬁes

(10.9)

Re g(s) > 0

for all s ∈ G.

Finally, note that Lemma 10.7 asserts that fτ = Ψτ|(R ∪ F0) for each τ ∈ T2.

Consequently,

for each τ ∈ T2 and each s ∈ R ∪ F0. Therefore, using equations (10.4) and (10.7),
for each s ∈ R ∪ F0, we have

1 + fτ (s)
1 − fτ (s)

=

1 + Ψτ (s)

This completes the proof of Theorem 10.1.

V and a circular region R in the plane

In the light of Lemma 9.10 the study of algebraic sets V in G that have the
norm-preserving extension property can be reduced to the case where V does not
have contact with any ﬂat datum. Our goal in this section is to show, under these
assumptions, that V is a properly embedded planar Riemann surface of ﬁnite type
[meaning that the boundary of V has ﬁnitely many connected components].

Lemma 11.1. Let V be an algebraic set in G with the norm-preserving extension

property. If s is an isolated point in V then V = {s}.

Proof. Let V0 = V \ {s} and suppose that V0 6= ∅. The function h on V
that has value 1 at s and value 0 on V0 is holomorphic on V . By the norm-
preserving extension property h extends to a holomorphic function H on G such
that supG |H| = 1. Since H attains its maximum modulus at a point of G, H is
constant, a contradiction. Hence V0 = ∅, and so V = {s}.

(cid:3)

Recall that the map β : G → D was deﬁned in Proposition 4.15 by the formula

(11.1)

β(s) =

s1 − s1s2
1 − |s2|2

for s ∈ G.

Lemma 11.2. Let V be an algebraic set in G having the norm-preserving ex-
tension property. If V is not a singleton and V does not have contact with any
ﬂat datum, then V is a Riemann surface properly embedded in G and β|V is a
homeomorphism onto its range.

Proof. Clearly, as V is assumed to not have contact with any ﬂat datum,
V 6= G. Therefore, if V is not a singleton, it follows from Lemma 11.1 that V has
no isolated points and so is a one-dimensional algebraic set in G. We ﬁrst prove
that V has no singular points, and as a consequence that V is a one-dimensional
complex manifold properly embedded in G. We then show that β|V is an open
mapping. As Proposition 4.15 implies that β|V is injective, it follows that β|V is a
homeomorphism onto its range.
V has no singular points. Fix s0 ∈ V and choose a neighborhood U0 of s0 and

a holomorphic function ζ on U0 such that

(11.2)

V ∩ U0 = Zζ,

where Zζ denotes the zero set of ζ in U0. Let β0 = β(s0). Introduce local coordi-
nates (z, w) at s0 by setting

and deﬁne η by

s = s0 + z( ¯β0, 1) + w(1,−β0),

η(z, w) = ζ(s).

63

64

11. V AND A CIRCULAR REGION R IN THE PLANE

Now, since ( ¯β0, 1) points in the ﬂat direction at s0, there does not exist ε > 0 such
that η is identically zero on the set {(z, 0) : |z| < ε}; else V contacts the ﬂat in-
ﬁnitesimal datum (s0, ( ¯β0, 1)), contrary to hypothesis. Therefore, η(z, 0) has a zero
of ﬁnite positive order, ℓ say, at z = 0. Consequently, by the Weierstrass Prepara-
tion Theorem, there exist analytic functions of one variable b1, . . . , bℓ, deﬁned on a
neighborhood of zero and vanishing at zero, and a holomorphic function h(z, w) on
a neighborhood of (0, 0) such that if Pw is the pseudopolynomial

Pw(z) = zℓ + b1(w)zℓ−1 + . . . + bℓ(w),

then

(11.3)

η(z, w) = Pw(z)h(z, w) and h(z, w) 6= 0

on a neighborhood of (0, 0). Evidently, it will be the case that s0 is not a singular
point of V if Pw has a unique irreducible factor, which has degree 1.

To see that Pw has a unique irreducible factor, assume to the contrary that Qw
and Rw are distinct irreducible factors of Pw. Choose sequences {wn}, {xn}, and
{yn} such that wn → 0 and

Qwn (xn) = 0 = Rwn (yn)

for all n. Since Qw and Rw are distinct and irreducible, by passing to a subsequence
if necessary, we may also assume that xn 6= yn for all n; moreover, by equations
(11.2) and (11.3), xn → 0 and yn → 0. Finally, deﬁne sn, tn ∈ V by setting

sn = s0 + xn( ¯β0, 1) + wn(1,−β0)

and

With the above constructions we have sn → s0 and

tn = s0 + yn( ¯β0, 1) + wn(1,−β0).

tn − sn
ktn − snk

=

yn − xn
kyn − xnk

( ¯β0, 1)
k( ¯β0, 1)k

.

tn − sn
ktn − snk → χ

( ¯β0, 1)
k( ¯β0, 1)k

,

After passage to a further subsequence one infers that there exists χ ∈ T such that

which is a ﬂat direction at s0. Thus V is contacted by the ﬂat inﬁnitesimal datum
(s0, ( ¯β0, 1)), contrary to assumption. This completes the proof that Pw does not
have a distinct pair of irreducible factors.

To see that each of the irreducible factors of Pw has degree 1, assume to the
contrary that Qw is an irreducible factor and deg Qw = d ≥ 2. Since Qw is ir-
reducible, there exists ε > 0 such that for each w with 0 < |w| < ε the equation
Qw(z) = 0 has exactly d distinct roots. Thus we may choose sequences {wn}, {xn},
and {yn} such that wn → 0 and

xn 6= yn

and Qwn(xn) = 0 = Qwn (yn)

for all n. By the argument of the previous paragraph, these sequences lead to a
contradiction to the assumption that V does not have contact with a ﬂat datum.
We have shown that Pw(z) = (z + b1(w))kh(z, w) for some positive integer k.

Thus

(11.4)

V ∩ U0 = Zζ = {s ∈ U0 : z + b1(w) = 0}

11. V AND A CIRCULAR REGION R IN THE PLANE

65

and V ∩ U0 = f (N ) for some neighborhood N of 0 in C, where
(11.5)

f (w) = s0 − b1(w)( ¯β0, 1) + w(1,−β0).

Thus s0 is not a singular point of V . Hence V has no singular points.

β|V is an open mapping. As V is a one dimensional analytic set without
singular points, it follows that V is a Riemann surface. Since algebraic sets are
closed, the injection map of V into G is a proper embedding. There remains to
show that the function β|V is a homeomorphism onto its range. Clearly, β|V
is continuous. Furthermore, as V is assumed not to have contact with any ﬂat
geodesic, it is clear from Proposition 4.15 that β|V is injective. We conclude the
proof that β is a homeomorphism by showing that β|V is an open mapping.

Firstly, for f as in equation (11.5),

df0 = (−b′

1(0) ¯β0 + 1, −b′

1(0) − β0) dw0.

Secondly, the total complex diﬀerential of β at a general point s ∈ G is given by

Thirdly, observe that if f = (f 1, f 2) is given by equation (11.5), then

(df 1)0 = (−b′

1(0) ¯β0 + 1)dw0

and

(df 2)0 = (−b′

1(0) − β0)dw0,

and so

(11.7)

Similarly

(11.8)

(df 1 − ¯β0df 2)0 = (−b′

1(0) ¯β0 + 1) − ¯β0(−b′

1(0) − β0)dw0

= (1 + |β0|2)dw0.

(d ¯f 1 − β0d ¯f 2)0 = (1 + |β0|2)d ¯w0.

Therefore, by virtue of equations (11.6), (11.7) and (11.8),

(11.9)

where

d(β ◦ f )0 = C(dw0 − s2

C =

1 + |β0|2

0|2 > 0.

Let u(x, y), v(x, y) be the real and imaginary parts of β ◦ f (x + iy) for x, y ∈ R. It
follows from equation (11.9) that the Jacobian determinant of β ◦ f at 0 is

∂(u, v)
∂(x, y)

(0) = C2 − |Cs2

0|2 = C2(1 − |s2

0|2) > 0.

By the Inverse Function Theorem, β ◦ f is invertible in a neighborhood of s0 in V .
As the point s0 ∈ V is arbitrary, β|V is an open mapping, as was to be proved.
We have shown that V is a one-dimensional manifold. By Proposition 9.1, V
is connected, and so V is a Riemann surface.
(cid:3)

66

11. V AND A CIRCULAR REGION R IN THE PLANE

Lemma 11.3. If V is an algebraic set in G then β(V ) is a semialgebraic set

and ∂β(V ) has a ﬁnite number of components.

Proof. G is the set of points s ∈ C2 such that

|s1 − s1s2|2 < (1 − |s2|2)2,

and therefore G is a semialgebraic set. Since V = G ∩ A for some algebraic set A,
it follows that V is a semialgebraic set (see, for example, [20]). It is clear from the
deﬁnition of β that β is a regular mapping on G (that is, the real and imaginary
parts of β are rational functions whose denominators do not vanish on G). Hence β
is a semialgebraic map, and so, by [20, Proposition 2.2.7], β(V ) is a semialgebraic
set. It follows from [20, Proposition 2.2.2] that the boundary ∂β(V ) of β(V ) is
a semialgebraic set. By [20, Theorem 2.4.5], ∂β(V ) has ﬁnitely many connected
components.
(cid:3)

A circular region is deﬁned to be a region in C whose boundary consists of
a ﬁnite number of disjoint nondegenerate circles. These domains are canonical
multiply connected domains, in the sense that every ﬁnitely connected planar do-
main is conformally equivalent to a circular region [22, Theorem 7.9]. A domain is
nondegenerate if none of its boundary components is a singleton set.

Lemma 11.4. Let V be an algebraic set in G having the norm-preserving exten-
sion property. If V does not have contact with any ﬂat datum, then either V is a
singleton or there exists a circular region R in the plane and a bijective holomorphic
mapping σ : R → V such that σ′(z) 6= 0 for all z ∈ R.

Proof. Suppose that V is not a singleton. By Lemma 11.2, V is a Riemann
surface and V is homeomorphic to β(V ), an open subset of D. Now any open
planar Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to a plane region R [12, Chapter
III, Paragraph 4]. By Lemma 11.3, ∂β(V ) has a ﬁnite number of components,
and so β(V ) is ﬁnitely connected. Since R is homeomorphic to β(V ), R is a
ﬁnitely connected plane region. We claim that R is nondegenerate. Suppose, to the
contrary, that there is some point z0 that is a singleton boundary component of R.
Let σ = (a, b) : R → V be a conformal map onto the Riemann surface V . Since
every bounded holomorphic function on R \ {z0} continues holomorphically to R,

s0

def= lim
z→z0

(a(z), b(z))

exists. Furthermore, since z0 ∈ ∂R, s0 ∈ ∂V ⊆ ∂G. Hence there exists ω ∈ T
such that |Φω(s0)| = 1, for otherwise |Φω(s0)| < 1 for all ω ∈ T, which implies
that s0 ∈ G, by Proposition A.1. The holomorphic extension to R ∪ {z0} of Φω ◦ σ
has modulus at most 1 and attains its maximum modulus at the interior point z0,
contrary to the Maximum Modulus Principle. Hence the boundary of R has no
singleton components, and so, by [22, Theorem 7.9], we can assume that R is a
circular domain. Then σ : R → V is the required conformal map.
(cid:3)

CHAPTER 12

Proof of the main theorem

This chapter is devoted to the proof of Theorem 1.4. For convenience we repeat

the statement.

Theorem 12.1. V is an algebraic subset of G having the norm-preserving ex-
tension property if and only if either V is a retract in G or V is the union of R
and a ﬂat geodesic in G.

By Proposition 9.2 and Theorem 10.1, if V is a retract in G or V = R ∪ D,
where D is a ﬂat geodesic in G, then V is an algebraic subset of G with the norm-
preserving extension property. We shall prove the converse.

Accordingly, for the remainder of the chapter, ﬁx a set V ⊆ G such that

(12.1)

V is an algebraic set in G, and

(12.2)

V has the norm-preserving extension property.

We wish to show that V is a retract in G or V = R ∪ D, where D is a ﬂat
geodesic in G. This conclusion certainly follows if V is a singleton set or if V = G.
We may therefore assume that

(12.3)

V is not a singleton set, and

(12.4)
If V has contact with a ﬂat datum δ, then by Lemma 9.10, either V = G or V = Dδ,
both of which are retracts in G, or V = R∪Dδ. If V has contact with a royal datum
δ, then by Lemma 9.11, either V = R, V is the union of R and a ﬂat geodesic in
G or V = G. We may therefore assume further that

V 6= G.

(12.5)

V does not have contact with any ﬂat or royal datum.

By Lemma 11.4 there exists a circular region R in the plane and a bijective holo-
morphic mapping σ : R → V such that σ′(z) 6= 0 for all z ∈ R.

Lemma 12.2. If V has contact with a purely balanced datum δ in G then (1)

V = Dδ and (2) V is a retract in G.

Proof. Suppose that V has contact with a purely balanced datum δ in G. By
Lemma 9.6, Dδ ⊆ V . Choose a solution k of Kob(δ), so that Dδ = k(D). Then k
is a rational Γ-inner function and so a fortiori proper as a map from D to V , and
hence f def= σ−1 ◦ k is a proper injective holomorphic map from D to R. By the

Open Mapping Theorem, f is a homeomorphism from D to f (D). We claim that
f (D) = R.

Suppose that f (D) 6= R. Choose a point w ∈ R \ f (D), a point u ∈ f (D) and a
continuous path γ from u to w in R. Let z0 = γ(t0) where t0 = sup{t : γ(t) ∈ f (D)}.
Then z0 ∈ (∂f (D)) ∩ R.

67

68

12. PROOF OF THE MAIN THEOREM

Pick a sequence (λn) in D such that f (λn) → z0. If (λn) has a subsequence
which converges to a limit µ in D then f (µ) = z0 and hence z0 ∈ f (D), a con-
tradiction. Hence |λn| → 1, and so, by the propriety of f , f (λn) tends to ∂R,
and so z0 ∈ ∂R, contrary to the fact that z0 ∈ R. Hence f (D) = R, and so
k(D) = σ ◦ f (D) = σ(R) = V . Thus Dδ = V , and so V is a retract in G (see
equation (5.1)).

(cid:3)

In the light of Lemma 12.2 we may further assume that

(12.6)

V does not have contact with any purely balanced datum.

Let

(12.7)

∂R = ∂0 ∪ ∂1 ∪ ··· ∪ ∂n

be a decomposition of ∂R into its connected components, where ∂0 is the boundary
of the unbounded component of the complement of R−. We may take ∂0 to be the
unit circle.

Lemma 12.3. If n = 0 then V is a nontrivial retract in G and is a complex

geodesic of G.

Proof. Since n = 0 we have R = D. By assumption V is an algebraic subset of
G having the norm-preserving extension property, and thus the map σ−1 : V → D
has a holomorphic extension f : G → ¯D. By the Open Mapping Theorem, f (G) ⊂
D, and so σ◦ f is a holomorphic map from G to V which is the identity on V . That
is, V is a retract in G. By statements (12.3) and (12.4), V is neither a singleton nor
the whole of G, and so V is a nontrivial retract. By Theorem 5.1, V is a complex
geodesic in G.
(cid:3)

The rest of the proof consists of a demonstration that n = 0.
Suppose n 6= 0. Write σ = (a, b), so that a and b are holomorphic functions on

R and, for all z ∈ R, a′(z) and b′(z) are not both zero.

12.1. Preliminary lemmas

For ω ∈ T let fω = Φω ◦ σ : R → D. Deﬁne A ⊆ D(R) by

A = {fω : ω ∈ T}.

Lemma 12.4. If ω1 6= ω2 then fω1 6= fω2.
Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that ω1, ω2 are distinct point in T but fω1 =

fω2. Straightforward manipulation of the equation
2ω2b − a
2 − ω2a

2ω1b − a
2 − ω1a

=

yields the relation a2 = 4b, so that V = σ(R) ⊆ R, contrary to the statement
(12.5).

(cid:3)

Lemma 12.5. A is a universal set for the Carath´eodory Problem on R. Fur-
thermore, if ζ is a nondegenerate datum in R, then there exists a unique f ∈ A
that solves Car(ζ).

12.1. PRELIMINARY LEMMAS

69

Proof. If ζ is a datum in R then σ(ζ) is a datum in V . Furthermore, since
σ is biholomorphic, the holomorphic invariance of the Carath´eodory metric implies
that

Here we use a self-explanatory variant on the notation | · |car which indicates the
domain in question. Also, as V has the norm-preserving extension property,

|ζ|R = |σ(ζ)|V .

|σ(ζ)|V = |σ(ζ)|G.

Therefore, if we view σ(ζ) as a datum in G and we choose ω ∈ T such that Φω
solves Car(σ(ζ)), then fω = Φω ◦ σ solves Car(ζ).
To see that fω is unique, assume to the contrary that fω1 and fω2 solve Car(ζ)
and ω1 6= ω2. Then Φω1 and Φω2 both solve Car(σ(ζ)). This means that σ(ζ) is a
ﬂat, royal or purely balanced datum that contacts V , contrary to statements (12.5)
and (12.6).
(cid:3)

In the light of Lemma 12.3 it is clear that the proof of Theorem 1.4 will be

complete if we establish that n = 0. Assume to the contrary that

(12.8)

n ≥ 1.

While A is a universal set for the Carath´eodory Problem on R, by Lemma 12.5,
it is not necessarily the case that each f ∈ A solves Car(ζ) for some nondegenerate
datum ζ in R. Accordingly, we deﬁne a set E ⊆ T by

E = {ω ∈ T : fω solves Car(ζ) for some nondegenerate datum ζ in R}
It is well known that the Carath´eodory extremal functions on R (the Ahlfors
functions) are (n + 1)-valent inner functions that analytically continue to a neigh-
borhood of R− (for example, [25, Chapter 5, Theorem 1.6]).
In particular the
functions fω, ω ∈ E enjoy these properties. Of course fω is nonconstant for ω ∈ E.
Lemma 12.6. There exist two datums ζ1 and ζ2 in R such that fω1 solves

Car(ζ1), fω2 solves Car(ζ2), and ω1 6= ω2.

Proof. Fix a datum ζ1 in R and let fω1 solve Car(ζ1). As f is (n + 1)-valent,
there exist z1, z2 ∈ R such that z1 6= z2 and fω1(z1) = fω2(z2). Let ζ2 = (z1, z2).
As |fω1(ζ2)| = 0, fω1 cannot possibly solve Car(ζ2). Therefore, the lemma follows
by choice of ω2 such that fω2 solves Car(ζ2).

(cid:3)

Lemma 12.7. If n ≥ 1 then E is an inﬁnite set.
Proof. Assume to the contrary that E is ﬁnite.
Fix a nondegenerate discrete datum ζ1 = (z0, z1) in R and let fω1 solve Car(ζ1).
Since fω1 is (n + 1)-valent and n ≥ 1, there exists z2 ∈ R with z2 6= z1 and
fω1(z1) = fω1(z2). Construct a continuous curve γ : [1, 2] → R with γ(1) = z1 and
γ(2) = z2 and deﬁne a curve of discrete datums δt in R by the formula

ζt = (z0, γ(t)),

1 ≤ t ≤ 2.

Since Lemma 12.5 guarantees that for each t ∈ [1, 2] there exists a unique ω ∈ E
such that fω solves Car(ζt), it follows that there exists a well deﬁned function
Ω : [1, 2] → E such that

Also, observe that by construction, Ω(1) = ω1.

fΩ(t) solves Car(ζt) for all t ∈ [1, 2].

70

12. PROOF OF THE MAIN THEOREM

We claim that for each τ ∈ E, Ω−1({τ}) is an open subset of [1, 2]. To prove
this claim, ﬁx τ0 = Ω(t0) ∈ E and note that since the solution to Car(ζt0 ) is unique,
(12.9)

|fτ (ζt0 )| < |fτ0(ζt0 )| for all τ ∈ E \ {τ0}.

It follows by continuity, that equation (12.9) holds, with t0 replaced by t, for all t
in a neighborhood I of t0. But then,

fτ0 solves Car(ζt) for all t ∈ I,

that is, I ⊆ Ω−1({τ0}. This proves that Ω−1({τ}) is an open subset of [1, 2] for
each τ ∈ E.

Since Ω is continuous and [1, 2] is connected, Ω is constant. Hence

Ω(2) = Ω(1) = ω1

and fω1 solves Car(ζ2). But ζ2 is nondegenerate while |fω1 (ζ2)| = 0.

(cid:3)

12.2. σ : R → V is analytic on R−

Lemma 12.8. The map σ extends holomorphically to a neighborhood of R−.

Proof. By Lemma 12.7 there exist distinct points ω1, ω2 ∈ E. Let

(12.10)

f1 = fω1 =

and f2 = fω2 =

2ω1b − a
2 − ω1a

2ω2b − a
2 − ω2a

.

Solve these equations for a and b in terms of f1, f2:
ω1f2 − ω2f1

a = 2

ω2 − ω1 + ω1ω2(f2 − f1)
f2 − f1 + (ω2 − ω1)f1f2
.
ω2 − ω1 + ω1ω2(f2 − f1)

b =

Since f1 and f2 are holomorphic on a neighborhood of R−, a and b extend to
meromorphic functions deﬁned on a neighborhood of R−. But a and b are bounded
on R, and so extend to holomorphic functions on a neighborhood of R−.
(cid:3)

Lemma 12.9. σ(∂R) is contained in the distinguished boundary bΓ of the closure

Γ of G, and therefore

|a| ≤ 2,

|b| = 1

and

a = ¯ab

on ∂R.

Proof. We are using the characterization of bΓ given in Proposition A.2. First
notice that as σ ∈ G(R), |a(z)| < 2 for all z ∈ R. By Lemma 12.8, σ extends
continuously to ∂R, and therefore |a(z)| ≤ 2 for all z ∈ ∂R. There remains to prove
that a = ¯ab and |b| = 1 on ∂R.
Let f1 and f2 be as in Lemma 12.8, let E1 = {z ∈ ∂R : a(z) = 2¯ω1} and
E2 = {z ∈ ∂R : a(z) = 2¯ω2}. Clearly, Lemma 12.8 guarantees that E1 and E2 are
ﬁnite. As

f1 =

2ω1b − a
2 − ω1a

is inner, it follows that |Φω1(a(z), b(z))| = 1 for all z ∈ ∂R \ E1. Since, for such z,
(a(z), b(z)) ∈ Γ \ {(2¯ω1, ¯ω2
(12.11)

1)}, Proposition A.5 shows that
ω1(cid:0)a(z) − a(z)b(z)(cid:1) = 1 − |b(z)|2

12.3. DEGREE CONSIDERATIONS

71

for all z ∈ ∂R \ E1. But Lemma 12.8 implies that a and b are continuous on ∂R.
Therefore, equation (12.11) holds for all z ∈ ∂R. In similar fashion we deduce that
(12.12)
Since ω1 6= ω2, it follows immediately from equations (12.11) and (12.12) that
(12.13)
for all z ∈ ∂R. Thus σ(z) ∈ bΓ for all z ∈ ∂R.

ω2(cid:0)a(z) − a(z)b(z)(cid:1) = 1 − |b(z)|2

a(z) − a(z)b(z) = 0 and |b(z)| = 1

for all z ∈ ∂R.

(cid:3)

The following lemma gives an additional relationship between a and b that

must hold whenever ω ∈ E.

Lemma 12.10. If ω ∈ E and a(η) = 2¯ω for some η ∈ ∂R, then b(η) = ¯ω2. In

consequence

Proof. Suppose that b(η) 6= ¯ω2. Then Φω is continuous at σ(η), and

a(η)2 = 4b(η).

fω =

2ωb − a
2 − ωa

is bounded on a neighborhood of σ(η). Since 2−ωa = 0 at η, necessarily 2ωb−a = 0
at η, so that b(η) = ¯ω2.

(cid:3)

Lemma 12.11. The set

is ﬁnite.

F def= {ω ∈ T : 2¯ω ∈ a(∂R)}

Proof. If not then there is an inﬁnite sequence (ωi) of distinct points in T
and a sequence (ηi) of distinct points in ∂R such that a(ηi) = 2¯ωi for each i.
Lemma 12.10 then implies that a(ηi)2 = 4b(ηi) for all i. Hence, by Lemma 12.8,
a(η)2 = 4b(η) for all η ∈ R, so that σ(R) is contained in the royal variety R.
Then each datum in G that contacts V also contacts R, contrary to assumption
(12.5).

(cid:3)

Lemma 12.12. There exists ω ∈ E such that 2¯ω /∈ a(∂R).
Proof. Lemma 12.7 asserts that E is inﬁnite, while Lemma 12.11 states that
the subset F of E is ﬁnite. Therefore E \ F is nonempty, that is, there exists ω ∈ E
such that 2¯ω /∈ a(∂R).

12. PROOF OF THE MAIN THEOREM

We note that if ϕ is a nonconstant inner function on R that extends to be holomor-
phic on a neighborhood U of R−, then #r(ϕ) ≥ 1 for each r so that #(ϕ) ≥ n + 1.
Furthermore, since the cycle ∂0 + ··· + ∂n is clearly homologous to 0 in U , we
may apply the Argument Principle to deduce that in this case #(ϕ) is equal to the
number of zeros of ϕ in R (for example, [11, Chapter 4, Subsection 5.2]).

Lemma 12.13.

(12.14)

#(b) = n + 1.

ωa(z) 6= 2 for all z ∈ ∂R.
z ∈ ∂R. Hence the curves

Proof. By Lemma 12.12, there is an ω ∈ E such that 2¯ω 6∈ a(∂R). Thus
It follows from Lemma 12.9 that |a(z)| ≤ 2 for all
2 − ωa
2 − ωa

are well deﬁned and do not meet the closed negative real axis for r = 0, . . . , n.
Therefore

z ∈ ∂r,

(z),

we have #(fω) = #(b). Now fω is not a constant function, for otherwise Φω ◦ σ is
a constant of unit modulus on R, and hence σ(R) ⊆ ∂G, which is false. Thus the
Ahlfors function fω for R has n + 1 zeros counting multiplicity, so that

(12.16)

#(fω) = n + 1.

Therefore #(b) = n + 1.

(cid:3)

Notice that the equation (12.15) is valid for all ω ∈ T \ F , and therefore the

index formula (12.16) is also valid for such ω.

Lemma 12.14. The set F of Lemma 12.11 is empty.
Proof. Assume to the contrary that ω0 ∈ F , say a(z0) = 2¯ω0 where z0 ∈ ∂R.
Since F is ﬁnite, there exists a sequence {ωi}i≥1 in T \ F such that ωi → ω0.
Consequently, fωi → fω0 uniformly on compact subsets of R. Furthermore, the
denominator of fωi, 2 − ωia, converges uniformly on a neighborhood U of ¯R to the
denominator of fω0 . Hence, by Hurwitz’s Theorem, 2 − ωia has a zero at a point
wi ∈ U , and since ωi /∈ F , we have wi /∈ R−. We can assume that wi → z0. Thus
fωi has a pole at a point wi ∈ U \ ¯R. By the Schwarz Reﬂection Principle, for
i ≥ 0, fωi has a zero at a point zi ∈ R, where zi → z0. Now ωi /∈ F for each
i ≥ 1, and so the formula (12.16) obtains. Hence fωi is an inner function on R of
minimal degree n + 1. Since cancellation occurs in the limit fω0 of (fωi ), it follows
that #(fω0) < n + 1, and therefore #(fω0) = 0, which is to say that fω0 is constant.
However, since ω0 ∈ E, there is a nondegenerate datum δ in R such that fω0 solves
Car(δ), which implies that fω0 is nonconstant, a contradiction. Hence F = ∅. (cid:3)

Conclusion. It remains to show that n = 0. Suppose not.
By Lemma 12.14, the set F is empty. Therefore, on ∂R, |a| < 2 and

|4b − (4b − a2)| = |a2| < 4 = |4b|.

12.3. DEGREE CONSIDERATIONS

73

Hence, by Rouch´e’s Theorem, 4b − a2 has the same number of zeros as b, which, in
view of Lemma 12.13, is to say that

#(4b − a2) = #(b) = n + 1.

Since n ≥ 1, this implies that 4b − a2 has at least two zeros in R, and hence that
V = σ(R) meets R at least twice. Thus there exists a royal datum in G which
contacts V , contrary to statement (12.5).

We have established that n = 0. This completes the proof of Theorem 1.4.

Sets in D2 with the symmetric extension property

Motivation for the study of the norm-preserving extension property in a domain
of holomorphy is described in the introduction of [2]. One motive is to understand
the set of solutions of a Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation problem on D2. Another is
to prove reﬁnements of the inequalities of von Neumann [37] and Andˆo [14]. In
this section we shall apply the preceding results to obtain some statements relevant
to interpolation problems on D2 having a symmetry property; in the next section
we shall apply our results to the theory of spectral sets of commuting pairs of
operators.

In [2, Theorem 1.20] Agler and McCarthy described all sets in the bidisc that
have the norm-preserving extension property. The following statement is contained
their result.

Theorem 13.1. An algebraic set V in D2 has the norm-preserving extension

property if and only if V has one of the following forms.
(1) V = {λ} for some λ ∈ D2;
(2) V = D2;
(3) V = {(z, f (z)) : z ∈ D} for some f ∈ D(D);
(4) V = {(f (z), z) : z ∈ D} for some f ∈ D(D).

The authors also generalized the norm-preserving extension property in [2,

Deﬁnition 1.2] as follows.

Definition 13.2. Let Ω be a domain of holomorphy, V be a subset of Ω and
A be a collection of bounded holomorphic functions on V . Then V is said to have
the A-extension property (relative to Ω) if, for every f ∈ A, there is a bounded
holomorphic function g on Ω such that g|V = f and

Ω |g| = sup
sup

V |f|.

Let V be a symmetric algebraic set in D2 (‘symmetric’ meaning that (λ1, λ2) ∈
V implies that (λ2, λ1) ∈ V ). Let H ∞
sym(V ) denote the algebra of bounded holomor-
phic functions g on V which are symmetric, in the sense that g(λ1, λ2) = g(λ2, λ1)
for all (λ1, λ2) ∈ V . We say that V has the symmetric extension property if V has
the H ∞
sym(V )-extension property. In this section we shall describe all symmetric
algebraic sets in D2 that have the symmetric extension property. It is striking that
there are three species of set in D2 that have the symmetric extension property but
do not resemble any of the types in Theorem 13.1.

The symmetric extension property in D2 is closely related to the norm-preserving
extension property in G. We shall denote by t the transposition map t(λ1, λ2) =
(λ2, λ1).

13. SETS IN D2 WITH THE SYMMETRIC EXTENSION PROPERTY

Lemma 13.3. A symmetric subset V of D2 has the symmetric extension property

if and only if π(V ) has the norm-preserving extension property in G.

Proof. Note that since V is symmetric, V = π−1(π(V )).
Suppose that V ⊆ D2 has the symmetric extension property. Let f be a
bounded holomorphic function on π(V ); then f ◦π is a bounded symmetric function
on V . Moreover, f ◦ π is holomorphic on V . For consider any λ ∈ V . Since f is
holomorphic, there is a neighborhood U of π(λ) in G and a holomorphic function
g on U which agrees with f on U ∩ π(V ). Then g ◦ π is a holomorphic function on
the neighborhood π−1(U ) of λ which agrees with f ◦ π on π−1(U ) ∩ V . Thus f ◦ π
is a symmetric bounded holomorphic function on V . Since V has the symmetric
extension property, there exists a bounded holomorphic function f1 on D2 which
agrees with f ◦ π on V and satisﬁes
D2 |f1| = sup
sup

V |f ◦ π|.

2 (f1 + f1 ◦ t). Then ˜f is a symmetric bounded holomorphic function on

Let ˜f = 1
D2 which agrees with f ◦ π on V and satisﬁes
D2 | ˜f| = sup
sup

V |f ◦ π|.

There exists a holomorphic function F on G such that ˜f = F ◦ π. Then F agrees
with f on π(V ) and

π(V )|f|.
Hence π(V ) has the norm-preserving extension property in G.

V |f ◦ π| = sup

G |F| = sup
sup

D2 | ˜f| = sup

Conversely, suppose that π(V ) has the norm-preserving extension property in
G. We must show that V has the symmetric extension property. To this end
consider any bounded symmetric holomorphic function f on V . There exists a
unique function F on π(V ) such that f = F ◦ π. We claim that F is holomorphic
on π(V ).
Consider any s ∈ π(V ) and let µ ∈ V be a preimage of s under π. Since f
is holomorphic on V there exists a neighborhood U of µ in D2 and a holomorphic
function g on U such that f and g agree on U ∩ V . We claim that both U and g can
be taken to be symmetric. Indeed, if t(µ) = µ then deﬁne U1 to be U ∩ t(U ) and let
g1 = 1
2 (g + g ◦ t); then U1 is a symmetric neighborhood of µ and g1 is a symmetric
holomorphic function on U1 such that g1 and f agree on U1 ∩ V . If t(µ) 6= µ, let
U0 be an open ball centred at µ and contained in U such that U0 is disjoint from
t(U0), let U1 = U0 ∪ t(U0) and extend g to a symmetric holomorphic function on
U1 by g1(λ) = g ◦ t(λ) for λ ∈ t(U0). In either case U1 is a symmetric neighborhood
of µ and g1 agrees with f on U1 ∩ V .
The symmetric function g determines a holomorphic function H on the neigh-
borhood π(U ) of s such that g = H ◦ π on U . Then H is a holomorphic function
on the neighborhood π(U ) of s such that H and F agree on π(U ) ∩ π(V ). Thus F
is bounded and holomorphic on π(V ).
Since π(V ) has the norm-preserving extension property, there exists a bounded

holomorphic function ˜F on G which extends F and satisﬁes

G | ˜F| = sup
sup

π(V )|F| = sup

V |f|.

13. SETS IN D2 WITH THE SYMMETRIC EXTENSION PROPERTY

77

Then ˜F ◦ π is a bounded holomorphic function on D2 that extends f and has the
same supremum norm as f . Hence V has the symmetric extension property in
D2.
(cid:3)

Lemma 13.4. If V is a symmetric algebraic set in D2 then π(V ) is an algebraic

set in G.

Proof. Suppose that

V = {λ ∈ D2 : f (λ) = 0 for all f ∈ S}

for some set S ⊆ C[λ1, λ2]. Since V is symmetric, for λ ∈ D2 we have λ ∈ V if
and only if t(λ) ∈ V . Hence λ ∈ V if and only if both (f + f ◦ t)(λ) = 0 and
(f − f ◦ t)2(λ) = 0 for all f ∈ S. On replacing S by the set

{f + f ◦ t : f ∈ S} ∪ {(f − f ◦ t)2 : f ∈ S},

we may assume that S is a set of symmetric polynomials, and so can be expressed
in the form

for some set S♭ ⊆ C[s1, s2]. Then

S = {F ◦ π : F ∈ S♭}

π(V ) = {s ∈ G : F (s) = 0 for all F ∈ S♭}.

Hence π(V ) is an algebraic set.

(cid:3)

Recall that the notion of a balanced disc in D2 was given in Deﬁnition 5.2. It
is a subset D of D2 having the form D = {(z, m(z)) : z ∈ D} for some m ∈ Aut D.
Theorem 13.5. A symmetric algebraic set V in D2 has the symmetric exten-

{(z, z) : z ∈ T};

sion property if and only if one of the following six alternatives holds.
(1) V = {λ, t(λ)} for some λ ∈ D2;
(2) V = D2;
(3) V = D ∪ t(D) for some balanced disc D in D2 such that D− meets the set
(4) V = Vβ for some β ∈ D, where
def= {(z, w) ∈ D2 : z + w = β + ¯βzw};
(13.1)
(5) V = ∆ ∪ Vβ for some β ∈ D, where ∆ = {(z, z) : z ∈ D};
(6) V = Vm,r for some r ∈ (0, 1) and m ∈ Aut D, where
(13.2)

Vβ

Vm,r

def= {(z, w) ∈ D2 : Hr(m(z), m(w)) = 0}

and

(13.3)

Hr(z, w) def= 2zw(r(z + w) + 2 − 2r) − (1 + r)(z + w)2 + 2r(z + w).

Moreover, the six types of sets V in (1) to (6) are mutually exclusive.

Proof. Let V be a symmetric algebraic set in D2. By Lemma 13.4, π(V ) is
an algebraic set in G. By Lemma 13.3, V has the symmetric extension property if
and only if π(V ) has the norm-preserving extension property in G. By Theorem
1.4, π(V ) has the norm-preserving extension property if and only if either π(V ) is
a retract in G or π(V ) = R ∪ D for some ﬂat geodesic D of G.
(i) π(V ) is a retract and (ii) π(V ) = R ∪ D for some ﬂat geodesic D.

Suppose that V has the symmetric extension property. Consider the two cases

78

13. SETS IN D2 WITH THE SYMMETRIC EXTENSION PROPERTY

In case (ii), by Proposition 7.6, D = Fβ for some β ∈ D, and so V = π−1(R ∪
Fβ) = ∆ ∪ Vβ , as in alternative (5) of the theorem.
In case (i), by Theorem 1.3, the retracts in G are the singleton sets, G itself
and the complex geodesics in G. If π(V ) is either a singleton or G then alernative
(1) or (2) respectively holds.

The remaining possibility in case (i) is that π(V ) is a complex geodesic in G, so
that π(V ) = Dδ for some nondegenerate datum δ, of one of the ﬁve types described
If δ is ﬂat then D = Fβ for some β ∈ D, and V = Vβ, so
in Deﬁnition 3.4.
that alternative (4) holds. By Proposition 8.4, if δ is balanced then there exists a
balanced disc D in D2 such that π(D) = π(V ), and hence V = D∪ t(D). Moreover,
if k solves Kob(δ), then k(z) = (z + m(z), zm(z)) for some m ∈ Aut D, and the disc
D is given by {(z, m(z)) : z ∈ D}. Furthermore, since k has a royal node in T, the
disc D− meets {(z, z) : z ∈ T}. Thus alternative (3) holds.
There remains the case that π(V ) is a purely unbalanced geodesic. By Theorem
7.8, then π(V ) ∼ kr(D) for some r ∈ (0, 1), where
(2(1 − r)z, z(z − r))
(13.4)

for all z ∈ D.

kr(z) =

1

1 − rz

Let hr(z) = kr(−z). Then hr(D) = kr(D) and one ﬁnds that Φ1 ◦ hr = idD. We
may apply Proposition 5.5 to write hr(D) as the zero set of a polynomial. We have
hr = ˜qr/qr, where

As in equation (5.6), let

qr(z) = 1 + rz,

˜qr(z) = z(z + r).

Pr(s) = (2 − ωs1)2 ˜qr ◦ Φω(s) − s2qr ◦ Φω(s)

s2 − ¯ω2

= 2s2(rs1 + 2 − 2r) − (1 + r)(s1)2 + 2rs1.

By Proposition 5.5, kr(D) = G∩ P −1
(0)) for some
m ∈ Aut D. That is, there exist r ∈ (0, 1) and m ∈ Aut D such that (z, w) ∈ V if
and only if

(0). Hence π(V ) = G∩ ˜m−1(P −1

r

r

Pr(m(z) + m(w), m(z)m(w)) = 0.

Since the function Hr is deﬁned in equation (13.3) so that Hr(z, w) = Pr(z +w, zw),
we have V = Vm,r, and alternative (6) of the theorem holds.

We have shown that if V has the symmetric extension property then V is of
one of the forms (1) to (6). We prove the converse. If either of alternatives (1) or
(2) holds, then π(V ) is a singleton or G respectively and so π(V ) has the norm-
preserving extension property. If (5) holds then π(V ) = R∪Fβ, and so, by Theorem
1.4, π(V ) has the norm-preserving extension property in G.
We claim that, in the remaining cases (3), (4) and (6), π(V ) is a complex

geodesic in G.

If (3) holds then D = {(z, m(z)) : z ∈ D} for some m ∈ Aut D having a ﬁxed
point in T. The map k(z) = (z + m(z), zm(z)) is a complex C-geodesic and so
π(V ) = π(D) = k(D) is a geodesic of degree 2.

If (4) holds and V = Vβ for some β ∈ D, then π(V ) is the ﬂat geodesic Fβ.
If (6) holds and V = Vm,r for some m ∈ Aut D and r ∈ (0, 1), then π(V ) ∼
kr(D), where kr is given by equation (13.4), and so, by Theorem 7.8, π(V ) is a
(purely unbalanced) geodesic in G. Thus π(V ) has the norm-preserving extension
property in G.

13. SETS IN D2 WITH THE SYMMETRIC EXTENSION PROPERTY

79

In each of the six cases π(V ) has the norm-preserving extension property in G,

and therefore V has the symmetric extension property in D2.

To see that the classes (1) to (6) of sets V in D2 with the symmetric extension
property are mutually exclusive, one can simply consider the corresponding sets
π(V ). Our reasoning shows that, in cases (1) to (6), the corresponding set π(V )
is respectively (1) a singleton (2) G (3) an exceptional, purely balanced or royal
geodesic (4) a ﬂat geodesic (5) R ∪ Fβ for some β and (6) a purely unbalanced
geodesic.

CHAPTER 14

Applications to the theory of spectral sets

Two fundamental results in the harmonic analysis of operators on Hilbert space
[44] are the inequalities of von Neumann and Ando [37, 14], which can be expressed
by the statements

(1) the closed unit disc is a spectral set for every contraction, and
(2) the closed unit bidisc is a spectral set for every pair of commuting contractions.

In this chapter an operator means a bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space,
and a contraction means an operator of norm at most 1.
A spectral set for a
commuting n-tuple T of operators is a set V ⊆ Cn such that σ(T ) ⊆ V and, for
every holomorphic function f in a neighborhood of V ,

kf (T )k ≤ sup

V |f|.

The terminology spektralische menge is due to von Neumann [37]. Spectral sets
for commuting tuples of operators are commonly deﬁned to be closed subsets of
Cn, but in [2] the notion was broadened considerably, with the goal of a reﬁnement
of Ando’s and von Neumann’s inequalities.

Definition 14.1. Let V be a subset of Cn and T be an n-tuple of commuting
operators on a Hilbert space. T is subordinate to V if the spectrum σ(T ) is a subset
of V and every holomorphic function on a neighborhood of V that vanishes on V
annihilates T .

Clearly, if T is subordinate to V and g is the restriction to V of a holomorphic
function f on a neighborhood of V then we may uniquely deﬁne g(T ) to be f (T ),
where f (T ) is deﬁned by the Taylor functional calculus. We denote by H ∞(V ) the
algebra of functions f|V where f is bounded and holomorphic in some neighborhood
Uf of V . Thus, if T is subordinate to V then the map g 7→ g(T ) is a functional
calculus for H ∞(V ).

Definition 14.2. Let V ⊆ Cn, let A ⊆ H ∞(V ) and let T be an n-tuple of
commuting operators. V is an A-spectral set for T if T is subordinate to V and, for
every f ∈ A,
(14.1)

kf (T )k ≤ sup

V |f|.

Another formulation of Ando’s inequality is that D2 is a spectral set for any
commuting pair of contractions whose joint spectrum is contained in D2. Isolating
the role of D2 in this statement and generalizing it to arbitrary subsets of H ∞(V ),
in [2, Deﬁnition 1.12] the authors introduced the following notion.

81

82

14. APPLICATIONS TO THE THEORY OF SPECTRAL SETS

Definition 14.3. Let V ⊆ C2 and let A ⊆ H ∞(V ). Then V is an A-von

Neumann set

if the inequality

kf (T )k ≤ sup

V |f|

holds for all f ∈ A and all pairs T of commuting contractions which are subordinate
to V , in the sense of Deﬁnition 14.1.

Thus V is an A-von Neumann set if V is an A-spectral set for every pair T of

commuting contractions which is subordinate to V .

One of the main results of [2], Theorem 1.13, states that if V ⊆ D2 and A ⊆
H ∞(V ) then V is an A-von Neumann set if and only if V has the A-extension
property relative to D2. In the case that V is a symmetric subset of D2 and A is
the algebra H ∞
sym(V ) (see page 75), Theorem 13.5 enables us to give an explicit
description of the A-von Neumann sets in D2.

Theorem 14.4. Let V be a symmetric algebraic set in D2. Then V is an
sym(V )-von Neumann set if and only if V has one of the the six forms (1) to (6)

H ∞
in Theorem 13.5.

Proof. By [2, Theorem 1.13], V is an H ∞

sym(V )-von Neumann set in D2 if and
sym(V )-extension property relative to D2. By Theorem 13.5, the
only if V has the H ∞
latter is so if and only if V has one of the six forms (1) to (6) in the theorem. (cid:3)

The A-von Neumann sets of Deﬁnition 14.3 are very much tied to the bidisc.
One can deﬁne a similar notion for other subsets of C2. Let us illustrate with the
symmetrized bidisc.

Definition 14.5. A pair T of commuting bounded linear operators is a Γ-

contraction if Γ is a spectral set for T .

Let V ⊆ G and let A ⊆ H ∞(V ). Then V is a (G, A)-von Neumann set if V is

an A-spectral set for every Γ-contraction T subordinate to V .

Theorem 14.6. Let V ⊆ G and let A ⊆ H ∞(V ). Then V is a (G, A)-von

Neumann set if and only if V has the A-extension property relative to G.

Proof. Suppose that V has the A-extension property relative to G. Consider

any f ∈ A. There exists g ∈ H ∞(G) such that g|V = f and
(14.2)

V |f|.
Let T be a Γ-contraction subordinate to V : then
G |g|,

kg(T )k ≤ sup

G |g| = sup
sup

and so,by equation (14.2),

(14.3)

kf (T )k = kg(T )k ≤ sup

Γ |g| = sup

V |f|.

This inequality holds for all f ∈ A, and so V is an A-spectral set for T . Since this
is true for every Γ-contraction T subordinate to V , it follows that V is a (G, A)-von
Neumann set.

14. APPLICATIONS TO THE THEORY OF SPECTRAL SETS

83

Conversely, suppose that V is a (G, A)-von Neumann set. We claim that
π−1(V ) is an A ◦ π-von Neumann set contained in D2. Consider a commuting
pair of contractions T subordinate to π−1(V ). Then π(T ) is a Γ-contraction and

σ(π(T )) = π(σ(T )) ⊆ π(π−1(V )) = V.

Let us show that π(T ) is subordinate to V . Consider g holomorphic on a neighbor-
hood of V and such that g|V = 0. Then g ◦ π is holomorphic on a neighborhood
of π−1(V ) and is zero on π−1(V ). Since T is subordinate to π−1(V ), g ◦ π(T ) = 0
and hence π(T ) is subordinate to V .
By assumption, V is a (G, A)-von Neumann set, and so V is an A-spectral set

for π(T ). Therefore

(14.4)

kf ◦ π(T )k ≤ sup

V |f| = sup

π−1(V )|f ◦ π|

for all f ∈ A. Thus, for all F ∈ A ◦ π,
(14.5)

kF (T )k ≤ sup

π−1(V )|F|

whenever T is a commuting pair of contractions subordinate to π−1(V ). That is,
π−1(V ) is an A ◦ π-von Neumann set in D2.
By [2, Theorem 1.13], a subset W of D2 is an A ◦ π-von Neumann set if and
only if W has the A ◦ π-extension property relative to D2. On applying this result
to W = π−1(V ) we deduce that π−1(V ) has the A◦ π-extension property relative to
D2. It follows that V has the A-extension property relative to G. Indeed, consider
f ∈ A ⊆ H ∞(V ). Since π−1(V ) has the A◦ π-extension property in D2, there exists
a bounded holomorphic function g on D2 which agrees with f ◦ π on π−1(V ) and
satisﬁes

D2 |g| = sup
sup

π−1(V )|f ◦ π| = sup

V |f|.

Let ˜g = 1
which agrees with f ◦ π on π−1(V ) and satisﬁes

2 (g + g ◦ t). Then ˜g is a symmetric bounded holomorphic function on D2

D2 |˜g| = sup
sup

π−1(V )|f ◦ π|.

There exists a holomorphic function F on G such that ˜g = F ◦ π. Then F agrees
with f on V and

G |F| = sup
sup

D2 |˜g| = sup

π−1(V )|f ◦ π| = sup

V |f|.

Hence V has the A-extension property relative to G.

(cid:3)

Theorem 14.6 has recently been proved by T. Bhattacharyya [19] by a diﬀerent

method.

In the event that A = H ∞(V ) for a subset V of G, we can describe all (G, A)-

von Neumann sets.

Theorem 14.7. Let V be an algebraic subset of G. Then V is a (G, H ∞(V ))-
von Neumann set in G if and only if either V is a retract in G or V = R ∪ D for
some ﬂat geodesic D in G, where R is the royal variety.

84

14. APPLICATIONS TO THE THEORY OF SPECTRAL SETS

Proof. By Theorem 14.6, V is a (G, H ∞(V ))-von Neumann set if and only
if V has the H ∞(V )-extension property relative to G. By Theorem 1.4, the latter
holds if and only if either V is a retract in G or V = R ∪ D for some ﬂat geodesic
D in G.

CHAPTER 15

Anomalous sets with the norm-preserving
extension property in some other domains

At little extra cost we can deduce from Theorems 1.3 and 1.4 that there are
anomalous sets having the norm-preserving extension property in some other do-
mains besides G – to wit, domains containing G as a retract. In particular, the
statement holds for the 2 × 2 spectral ball, the tetrablock and the pentablock,
deﬁned below.

Lemma 15.1. If Ω is a domain in Cd such that G can be embedded in Ω as a
retract then there exist sets which have the norm-preserving extension property but
are not retracts in Ω.

Proof. G can be embedded in Ω as a retract if and only if there exist ι ∈ Ω(G)
and κ ∈ G(Ω) such that κ is a left inverse of ι.
Suppose such maps ι and κ exist. Let D be a ﬂat geodesic in G and let
V = R ∪ D. By Theorem 1.4, V is a subset of G that has the norm-preserving
extension property. By Lemma 15.2 below, ι(V ) has the norm-preserving extension
property in Ω2.

However, ι(V ) is not a retract of Ω. For suppose that ρ is a retraction in Ω

with range ι(V ). Let

then

ρ1 = κ ◦ ρ ◦ ι : G → G;

Now ι ◦ κ acts as the identity mapping on ι(G), and so a fortiori on ran ρ. Hence

ρ1 ◦ ρ1 = κ ◦ ρ ◦ (ι ◦ κ) ◦ ρ ◦ ι.

ρ1 ◦ ρ1 = κ ◦ ρ ◦ ρ ◦ ι

= κ ◦ ρ ◦ ι
= ρ1.

Thus ρ1 is a retraction on G with range κ ◦ ι(V ), which is V . Therefore V is a
nontrivial retract in G. This contradicts Theorem 1.3, since V is clearly not a
geodesic (it is not homeomorphic to a disc). Hence ι(V ) is not a retract of Ω2. (cid:3)
Lemma 15.2. Let U1, U2 be domains and suppose that ι ∈ U2(U1), κ ∈ U1(U2)
satisfy κ◦ ι = idU1 . If a subset V of U1 has the norm-preserving extension property
in U1 then ι(V ) has the norm-preserving extension property in U2.

Proof. Consider a bounded holomorphic function f on ι(V ). Then f ◦ ι is
bounded and holomorphic on V , and so has a norm-preserving extension g to U1.
Thus g|V = f ◦ ι and

U1 |g| = sup
sup

V |f ◦ ι| = sup

ι(V )|f|.

85

86

15. ANOMALOUS SETS WITH THE EXTENSION PROPERTY IN OTHER DOMAINS

Now g ◦ κ is bounded and holomorphic on U2, and
U1 |g| = sup

ι(V )|f|.
Moreover, for any point of ι(V ), say ι(z) where z ∈ V ,

U2 |g ◦ κ| = sup
sup

g ◦ κ(ι(z)) = g ◦ κ ◦ ι(z) = g(z) = f ◦ ι(z).

Hence g ◦ κ is a norm-preserving extension of f to U2.

(cid:3)

The n × n spectral ball is the set

Ωn

def= {A ∈ Cn×n : r(A) < 1}

where r(·) denotes the spectral radius of a square matrix. The domain Ωn is of
interest principally in the theory of invariant distances and metrics [32, 38, 39,
15, 16]. Holomorphic interpolation from D to Ωn, the ‘spectral Nevanlinna-Pick
problem’, is a test case of the µ-synthesis problem of H ∞ control (see for example
[17, 47]).

The symmetrized bidisc was introduced as a tool for the study of Ω2, and so it
is natural to consider the implications of our main theorems for the function theory
of Ω2.

There are many ways in which G can be embedded as a retract in Ω2. Let
κ : C2×2 → C2 be deﬁned by κ(A) = (tr A, det A). Clearly a matrix A ∈ C2×2
belongs to Ω2 if and only if κ(A) ∈ G. For any holomorphic function
(15.1)
deﬁne a holomorphic map ιF : G → Ω2 by
ιF (s) = F (s)−1(cid:20) 0
(15.2)
−s2

F : G → GL2(C)

s1(cid:21) F (s).

Then κ ◦ ιF = idG, and so ιF is injective and ιF ◦ κ is a retraction in Ω2. Thus
ιF (G) is a retract in Ω2.

The tetrablock is the domain

E def= {(a11, a22, det A) : A =(cid:2)aij(cid:3)2

i,j=1 , kAk < 1}

in C3. There are many equivalent characterizations of this domain [1].
to show that the map ι : G → E given by
ι(s) = ( 1

2 s1, 1

2 s1, s2)

is a holomorphic injection with left inverse

It is easy

The pentablock is the domain

κ(z) = (z1 + z2, z3)
that maps E to G. Thus E contains G as a retract.
P = {(a21, tr A, det A) : A =(cid:2)aij(cid:3)2

in C3.
ι : G → P given by

ι(s) = (0, s1, s2)

The pentablock also admits numerous characterizations [9]. The map

i,j=1 , kAk < 1}

has a left inverse κ : P → G given by κ(z1, z2, z3) = (0, z2, z3). Thus G is embed-
dable as a retract in P.

15. ANOMALOUS SETS WITH THE EXTENSION PROPERTY IN OTHER DOMAINS

87

The tetrablock and the pentablock are both of interest in the theory of invariant
distances [32] and in the analysis of special cases of the µ-synthesis problem [47, 9].

The following statement is an immediate consequence of Lemma 15.1.
Theorem 15.3. The 2× 2 spectral ball Ω2, the tetrablock and the pentablock all
contain sets having the norm-preserving extension property which are not retracts
in the respective domains.

Remark 15.4. For a domain U in CN , N ≥ 3, one cannot expect all nontriv-
ial retracts to be complex geodesics. For example, let Ω be one of the following
domains: the 2 × 2 spectral ball Ω2, the tetrablock and the pentablock. Then the
image of G under ι in Ω is a retract which is not a complex geodesic (since it has
complex dimension 2).

APPENDIX A

Some useful facts about the symmetrized bidisc

In this appendix we gather together some established properties of the sym-
metrized bidisc G relevant to the paper, with appropriate citations. We also prove
analogs for inﬁnitesimal datums of some statements in the literature about discrete
datums. An alternative source for many of these results is [32, Chapter 7].

A.1. Basic properties of G and Γ

There are numerous criteria for a point of C2 to belong to G.
Proposition A.1. The following statements are equivalent for any s = (s1, s2) ∈

C2.
(1) s ∈ G (that is, there exist z, w ∈ D such that s = (z + w, zw));
(2) |s1 − s1s2| < 1 − |s2|2;
(3) |Φω(s)| < 1 for all ω ∈ T;
(4) there exists β ∈ D such that s1 = β + ¯βs2;
(5) 2|s1 − s1s2| + |(s1)2 − 4s2| < 4 − |s1|2.

The proof of this proposition can be found in [5, Theorem 2.1]. The functions

Φω, ω ∈ T, in (3) are those introduced in Deﬁnition 3.2.
unique and is given by

A simple calculation shows that, for any s ∈ G, the corresponding β in (4) is

(A.1)

β =

s1 − s1s2
1 − |s2|2 .

Recall from Section 4.2 that Γ denotes the closure of G and bΓ the distinguished
boundary of Γ. It means that bΓ is the Shilov boundary of the uniform algebra of
continuous complex-valued functions on Γ that are analytic in G. The following
descriptions of bΓ are to be found in [5, Theorem 2.4, equation (2.1)].

Proposition A.2.

bΓ = {(z + w, zw) : |z| = 1 = |w|}

= {s ∈ C2 : |s1| ≤ 2, |s2| = 1 and s1 = s1s2}.

A Γ-inner function is a holomorphic map h : D → G such that, for almost
all λ ∈ T with respect to Lebesgue measure, the radial limit limr→1− f (rλ) ∈ bΓ.
Rational Γ-inner functions were deﬁned in Deﬁnition 4.8.

Proposition A.3. If k is a nonconstant Γ-inner function and ω ∈ T then

Φω ◦ k is an inner function.

(cid:3)

The functions Φω, ω ∈ T, are central to the theory of G. Their most signiﬁcant

property is the following.

Theorem A.4. The functions Φω, ω ∈ T, constitute a universal set for the

Carath´eodory problem on G

This statement is in [5, Theorem 1.1 and Corollary 4.3].
It is easy to see that, for any ω ∈ T, the function Φω extends continuously to
Γ\{(2¯ω, ¯ω2)} (but not to Γ). The range of the extended function is D−. It is useful
to know which points are mapped into T.

Proposition A.5. For any ω ∈ T and s ∈ Γ \ {(2¯ω, ¯ω2)},

ω(s1 − s1s2) = 1 − |s2|2.
The proof is a simple calculation and is given in [5, Theorem 2.5].

|Φω(s)| = 1

if and only if

Theorem A.6. Let h = (s1, s2) be a nonconstant rational Γ-inner function
and let υ be a ﬁnite Blaschke product. Then Φυ ◦ h has a cancellation at ζ if and
only if the following conditions are satisﬁed: ζ ∈ T, ζ is a royal node for h and
υ(ζ) = 1
2 s1(ζ). Moreover Φυ ◦ h has at most one cancellation at any royal node ζ.

The proof of this theorem is given in [8, Theorem 7.12].

A.2. Complex C-geodesics in G

Recall from Section 4.1 that a map k ∈ G(D) is a complex C-geodesic if k has
a holomorphic left inverse. Such maps can be concretely described. The following
statement is [6, Lemma 1.1 and Theorem 1.2].

Theorem A.7. Let k : D → G be a complex C-geodesic of G. Then k2 is a
Blaschke product of degree 1 or 2, k extends to a continuous function on D− which
maps T into bΓ and there exist a M¨obius function υ and an ω0 ∈ T such that
Φω0 ◦ h = υ. Furthermore,

A. SOME USEFUL FACTS ABOUT THE SYMMETRIZED BIDISC

Proof. For if k∗ is the radial limit function of k then, for almost all τ ∈ T

there exist z, w ∈ T, not both equal to ¯ω, such that k∗(τ ) = (z + w, zw). Then

and, for all λ ∈ D,

k2 ◦ υ−1(¯ω0) = ¯ω2

k1(λ) = 2

1 − ω0υ(λ)

A fortiori, k is a rational Γ-inner function.

The following statement is a simple corollary.

Proposition A.8. Let δ be a nondegenerate non-ﬂat datum in G. If Φω solves
Car(δ), k solves Kob(δ) and k is normalised so that Φω ◦ k = idD, then k2 is a
Blaschke product of degree 2 and k(¯ω) = (2¯ω, ¯ω2).

A.3. AUTOMORPHISMS OF G

91

Corollary A.9. A map k ∈ G(D) is a complex C-geodesic of G if and only if

there is a nondegenerate datum δ in G such that k solves Kob(δ).

The following uniqueness result for complex C-geodesics (stated in the intro-

duction as Theorem 3.7) plays a vital role in the paper.

Theorem A.10. If δ is a nondegenerate datum in G then the solution to Kob(δ)

is essentially unique.

Proof. For discrete datums this statement is contained in [6, Theorem 0.3];
we prove the inﬁnitesimal case. Let δ = (s1, v) be a nondegenerate inﬁnitesimal
datum in G. According to the deﬁnition (3.2),
|δ|kob = inf{|ζ| : ζ is a datum in D and there exists h ∈ G(D) such that h(ζ) = δ}.
Note that, for a datum ζ = (z1, w) in D and h ∈ G(D),

h(ζ) = (h(z1), Dwh(z1)) = (h(z1), wh′(z1)).

Thus

h(ζ) = δ ⇔ h(z1) = s1, w(h1)′(z1) = v1 and w(h2)′(z1) = v2.

Hence, for a datum δ = (s1, v) in G,

|δ|kob = inf

z1∈D,w∈C(cid:26) |w|

1 − |z1|2 : there exists h ∈ G(D) such that
h(z1) = s1, w(h1)′(z1) = v1 and w(h2)′(z1) = v2(cid:9) .

Pick an inﬁnitesimal datum ζ = (z1, w) in D such that |ζ| = |δ|kob; then ζ is
nondegenerate. Let h = (s, p) solve Kob(δ) and satisfy h(ζ) = δ. Let Φω solve
Car(δ). Since | · |kob = | · |car on G, Φω ◦ h ∈ Aut D. Say Φω ◦ h = q. Then, by [6,
Lemma 1.1], p is a Blaschke product of degree at most 2 and

(A.2)

s = 2

ωp − q
1 − ωq

.

Hence, if τ = q−1(¯ω) ∈ T, then (ωp − q)(τ ) = 0, and so p(τ ) = ¯ω2. Thus p is a
Blaschke product of degree at most 2 which satisﬁes

p(z1) = s1, w(p)′(z1) = v2

and p(τ ) = ¯ω2.

These properties determine p uniquely.

Since q is an automorphism of D such that

q(ζ) = Φω ◦ h(ζ) = Φω(δ),

q is uniquely determined. Thus s is also uniquely determined by equation (A.2).
Hence there is a unique solution h of Kob(δ) for which h(ζ) = δ. It follows that
the solution of Kob(δ) is essentially unique.
(cid:3)

A.3. Automorphisms of G
For every m ∈ Aut D we deﬁne a map ˜m ∈ G(G) by
˜m(z + w, zw) = (m(z) + m(w), m(z)m(w))

(A.3)
It is easy to see that ˜m is an automorphism of G and that m 7→ ˜m is a homomor-
phism from Aut D to Aut G. In fact it is an isomorphism.

for all z, w ∈ D.

Theorem A.11. (1) Every automorphism of G is of the form ˜m for some m ∈
Aut D.

92

A. SOME USEFUL FACTS ABOUT THE SYMMETRIZED BIDISC

(2) Every automorphism of G leaves the royal variety R invariant.
(3) The automorphisms of G act transitively on the set of ﬂat geodesics of G.

Statement (1) is [7, Theorem 4.1], proved by an operator-theoretic method; a
proof which uses Cartan’s Classiﬁcation Theorem is given in [31] and [32]. Given
statement (1), statements (2) and (3) are easy to verify.

Corollary A.12. Every automorphism of G extends continuously to a bijec-

tive self-map of Γ.

It follows from Theorem A.11 and the fact that every automorphism of D

extends continuously to a bijective self-map of D−.

The automorphisms of G are linear fractional maps.

If m = τ Bα for some

τ ∈ T, α ∈ D then, for s ∈ G,
(A.4)

˜m(s) =

1 − ¯αs1 + ¯α2s2 (cid:0)τ (−2α + (1 + |α|2)s1 − 2 ¯αs2), τ 2(s2 − αs1 + α2)(cid:1) .

A.4. A trichotomy theorem

Since the classiﬁcation of datums in Deﬁnition 3.4 depends on the number of
functions Φω that solve the corresponding Carath´eodory problem, it is important
to know what the possibilities are for this number.

Trichotomy theorem A.13. Let δ be a nondegenerate datum in G. Exactly

one of the following assertions is true.
(1) There is a unique ω ∈ T such that Φω solves Car(δ);
(2) there are exactly two points ω1, ω2 ∈ T such that Φω1, Φω2 solve Car(δ);
(3) for all ω ∈ T, Φω solves Car(δ).
Moreover, all three possibilities do occur.

Proof. In the case that δ is a discrete datum, the statement is [6, Theorem
1.6]. We sketch a proof for a inﬁnitesimal datum δ = (s1, v): it is a combination of
the arguments in [5, Section 4] and [6, Theorem 1.6], where fuller versions of the
reasoning can be found.

For κ ≥ 0 let Sκ, Pκ be the operators on the Hilbert space C2 (with its standard

inner product) given by

Sκ, Pκ are commuting operators and σ(Sκ, Pκ) = {s1} ⊂ G. Moreover the spectral
radius of Sκ is |s1

Hence

f (Sκ, Pκ) =(cid:20)f (s1) κDvf (s1)
f (s1) (cid:21) .
κ|Dvf (s1)|
1 − |f (s1)|2 ≤ 1

⇔ κ|f (δ)| ≤ 1.

Now the condition (A.6) can be written

for all ω ∈ T,

A.5. DATUMS FOR WHICH ALL Φω ARE EXTREMAL

93

Recall that G is said to be a spectral domain for the commuting pair (S, P ) if
σ(S, P ) ⊂ G and

kf (S, P )k ≤ sup

G |f|

for every f ∈ C(G). It follows that G is a spectral domain for (Sκ, Pκ) if and only
if κ|δ|car ≤ 1.
On the other hand, by [5, Theorem 3.2], G is a spectral domain for (Sκ, Pκ) if
and only if kΦω(Sκ, Pκ)k ≤ 1 for all ω ∈ T, or equivalently, if and only if
(A.6)
for all ω ∈ T. The inequality (A.6) can be written

(2 − ωSκ)∗(2 − ωSκ) − (2ωPκ − Sκ)∗(2ωPκ − Sκ) ≥ 0

Re{ω(Sκ − S∗

κPκ)} ≤ 1 − P ∗

κ Pκ.

In the event that kPκk < 1 (that is, κ|v2| < 1 − |s2

Tκ = (1 − P ∗

2 ;

which is equivalent to the statement that the numerical range W (Tκ) is contained
in D−. For the extremal choice κ = 1/|δ|car, W (Tκ) touches the unit circle at one
or more points ω, and these values of ω are precisely those for which Φω solves
Car(δ). Since Tκ has rank one or two, W (Tκ) is either an ellipse (with its interior),
a point or a line segment. It follows that W (Tκ)∩ T consists of either a single point,
a pair of points or the whole of T. Thus the three possibilities for the solutions Φω
of Car(δ) are as described in the theorem.

Examples to show that all three possibilities in Theorem A.13 do occur may be
(cid:3)

found in the proof of [6, Theorem 1.6].

A.5. Datums for which all Φω are extremal

For the proof of the Pentachotomy Theorem in Section 3.3 it is required to
characterize the datums δ for which ρδ is constant on T, or in other words, for
which Φω is extremal for Car(δ) for all ω ∈ T. The next result is a re-statement of
[5, Theorem 5.5].

Theorem A.14. Let δ = (s1, s2) be a nondegenerate discrete datum in G. The

following statements are equivalent.
(1) Φω solves Car(δ) for every ω ∈ T;
(2) s1, s2 either both lie in the royal variety R or both lie in the set

Fβ = {(β + ¯βz, z) : z ∈ D}

for some β ∈ D.
We also need the inﬁnitesimal version of Theorem A.14.

Theorem A.15. Let δ = (s1, v) be a nondegenerate inﬁnitesimal datum in G.

The following statements are equivalent.
(1) Φω solves Car(δ) for every ω ∈ T;

(2) either (a) there exists z ∈ D such that s1 = (2z, z2) and v is collinear with
(1, z) or (b) there exist β, z ∈ D such that s1 = (β + ¯βz, z) and v is collinear
with ( ¯β, 1).
Proof. First show that (2)⇒(1). By the deﬁnition of ρδ, for ω ∈ T,

ρδ(ω) = |Φω(s1, v)|2 = |(Φω(s1), DvΦω(s1))|2 .

Suppose (a) holds, that is, s1 = (2z, z2) and v = λ(1, z) for some z ∈ D and λ 6= 0.
One can see that Φω(s1) = −z and

D(1,z)Φω(s1) =(cid:20) ∂

(cid:21)|s=(2z,z2)

Thus

Hence

Φω(δ) = (Φω(s1), Dλ(1,z)Φω(s1)) = (−z,− 1

2 λ).

Thus (a) implies that ρδ is constant on T.

ρδ(ω) = |(−z,− 1

2 λ)|2.

Suppose (b) holds, that is, s1 = (β + ¯βz, z) and v is collinear with ( ¯β, 1) for

some β, z ∈ D.

Φω(s1) =

2ωz − (β + ¯βz)
2 − ω(β + ¯βz)

= mω(z),

Now

Therefore, for all ω ∈ T,

A.5. DATUMS FOR WHICH ALL Φω ARE EXTREMAL

95

Since the Poincar´e metric on D is invariant under Aut D,

ρδ(ω) = |(z, 1)|2 =

(1 − |z|2)2 ,
which is independent of ω ∈ T. Thus (b) implies that ρδ is constant on T. Hence,
for each ω ∈ T, Φω solves Car(δ) in both cases (a) and (b).
Now we show that (1)⇒(2). Let δ = (s1, v) be a nondegenerate inﬁnitesimal
datum in G and suppose that ρδ is constant on T. Write

1

s1 = (β + ¯βp, p)

for some β, p ∈ D. Calculation shows that

|Φω(δ)| =
Thus the rational function

¯β − 2ω + βω2

1v2)ω2

.

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(A.7)

F (w) = −v1 + 2v2w + (pv1 − s1
¯β − 2w + βw2
has constant modulus, say C > 0, for w ∈ T. Hence

1v2)w2

C2 = F (w)F (w)

= F (w)F (1/ ¯w)

(A.8)
for all w ∈ T. Since the right hand side of equation (A.8) is a rational function of
w, the equation remains true for all w ∈ C for which F (w) and F (1/ ¯w) are ﬁnite.
First we consider the case that β = 0, when s1 = (0, p). Since |F| is constant
on T we have

for w ∈ T. It follows that either v1 = 0 or v2 = 0 and p = 0. In the former case

| − v1 + 2v2w + pv1w2| = const

and in the latter case

δ =(cid:0)(0, p), (0, v2)(cid:1)
δ =(cid:0)(0, 0), (v1, 0)(cid:1) ,

and the statement of the theorem holds.

Now consider the case that β 6= 0. We claim that cancellation occurs in the
fractional quadratic F . The zeros of the denominator ¯β − 2w + βw2 in the right
hand side of equation (A.7) are

w± =

1 ±p1 − |β|2

β

.

Observe that w+ ¯w− = 1, that is, w+ and w− are symmetric with respect to T.
Moreover, |w+| > 1 and |w−| < 1.
both poles of F . Equation (A.8) implies that
w± are zeros of the numerator of F , contrary to assumption.

Suppose there is no cancellation in equation (A.7). Then the points w± are
are zeros of F , that is,

and 1
¯w−

1
¯w+

If there is only one cancellation in equation (A.7), say at w+ and not at w−,

then F (w+) is ﬁnite and w− is a pole of F . Since, by equation (A.8),

C2 = F (w+)F (w−),

we have F (w+) = 0.

There are only two cases to consider:

96

A. SOME USEFUL FACTS ABOUT THE SYMMETRIZED BIDISC

Case 1: β 6= 0 and there exists exactly one cancellation in equation (A.7), which
is at w+ (when F (w+) = 0) or at w− (when F (w−) = 0). We shall show that in
this case the datum δ is such that s1 = (2z, z2) and v is collinear with (1, z) for
some z ∈ D.
Case 2: β 6= 0 and there exist 2 cancellations in equation (A.7), at both w+
and w−. We shall show that in this case the datum δ is such that s1 = (β + ¯βz, z)
and v is collinear with ( ¯β, 1) for some β, z ∈ D.

Case 1. Let w0 be one of the roots of equation
¯β − 2w + βw2 = 0.

(A.9)

On taking the complex conjugate of this equation we obtain the system:

(A.10)

0β

(cid:26) w2

β

+ ¯β
+ ¯w0

= 2w0
2 ¯β = 2 ¯w0,

which can be solved to give β = 2 ¯w0

1+|w0|2 .

If there exists exactly one cancellation in equation (A.7), which is at w0, then,

by L’Hˆopital’s Rule,

(A.11)

F (w0) =

2v2 + 2(pv1 − s1
−2 + 2βw0

1v2)w0

Therefore, the facts that there exists exactly one cancellation in equation (A.7) at
w0 and that F (w0) = 0 yield the system

(cid:26) −v1 + 2v2w0 +(pv1 − s1
+2(pv1 − s1

2v2

1v2)w2
0 = 0
1v2)w0 = 0,

which is equivalent to

(A.12)

(A.13)

Since δ is nondegenerate v 6= 0. Hence v2 6= 0 and
(A.14)

Recall that

Case 2: there exist 2 cancellations in equation (A.7), at both w+ and w−.
are zeros of F , that is, w± are zeros of the
Equation (A.8) implies that
numerator of F . Therefore, there exists λ 6= 0 such that the numerator and the
denominator of F are connected by the following equation

and 1
¯w−

¯w+

(A.15)
Since s1

− v1 + 2v2w + (pv1 − s1

1v2)w2 = −λ( ¯β − 2w + βw2).

1 = β + ¯βp, we have
−v1 + 2v2w + (pv1 − (β + ¯βp)v2)w2 = −λ ¯β + 2λw − βλw2), w ∈ C.

Therefore, v1 = λ ¯β, v2 = λ, pv1− (β + ¯βp)v2 = −βλ. Thus, v1 = ¯βv2, pv1− ¯βpv2 =
0. The datum δ =(cid:0)(β + ¯βp, p), v2( ¯β, 1)(cid:1) for some β, p ∈ D.
