ON THE SIGN PATTERNS OF THE COEFFICIENTS OF

HILBERT POLYNOMIALS

AKIYOSHI TSUCHIYA

Abstract. We show that all sign patterns of the coeﬃcients of Hilbert polyno-
mials of standard graded k-algebras are possible.

introduction

The purpose of this paper is to investigate which sign patterns of the coeﬃcients of
Hilbert polynomials of standard graded commutative k-algebras are possible. This
was asked by Mark Haiman ([2]). In this paper, we give a complete answer to this
question.

Let k be a ﬁeld and R a graded k-algebra. We call

H(R; i) := dimk(Ri)

the Hilbert function of R, where Ri is the graded component of R of degree i. We
say that a k-algebra R is standard if it can be ﬁnitely generated as a k-algebra by
elements of R1. It is known that if R is standard, then there exist a polynomial
PR(x) ∈ Q[x] and a positive integer N such that H(R; i) = PR(i) for all i ≥ N ([3]).
We call PR(x) the Hilbert polynomial of a standard graded k-algebra R. We refer
the readers to [4] for an introduction to the theory of standard graded k-algebras
and Hilbert polynomials.

Let f (x) be a Hilbert polynomial and d = deg(f (x)). The leading coeﬃcient, that
is, the coeﬃcient of xd of f (x) is positive. On the other hand, other coeﬃcients of
f (x) are not necessarily positive. We recall that the sign function of a real number
x is deﬁned as follows:

− 1 if x < 0,

0

if x = 0,

if x > 0.

In this paper, we show that all sign patterns of the coeﬃcients of Hilbert polyno-
mials are possible. In other words, given an integer d ≥ 1 and s ∈ {−1, 0, 1}d, there
exists a Hilbert polynomial f (x) of degree d such that S(f (x)) = s.

In this paper, we consider when a polynomial f (x) ∈ Z[x] is a Hilbert polynomial.

In fact, we will show the following theorem.

Theorem 0.1. Let d be a positive integer and a0, . . . , ad−1 integers. Then there
i=0 aixi + kxd ∈

exists a positive integer n such that for any integer k ≥ n, f (x) =Pd−1

Z[x] is a Hilbert polynomial.

By this theorem, we obtain the following corollary.

Corollary 0.2. For any d ≥ 1 and s = (s0, . . . , sd−1) ∈ {−1, 0, 1}d, there exists a
Hilbert polynomial f (x) ∈ Z[x] of degree d such that S(f (x)) = s.

This corollary says that all sign patterns of the coeﬃcients of Hilbert polynomials
are possible. In Section 1, we consider when a monomial f (x) ∈ Z[x] is a Hilbert
polynomial. In Section 2, we prove Theorem 0.1.

Acknowledgment. I would like to thank Professor Je´sus A. De Loera for suggesting
me to study the sign patterns of the coeﬃcients of Hilbert polynomials.

1. Hilbert monomials with an integral coefficient

In this section, we consider when a monomial f (x) ∈ Z[x] is a Hilbert polynomial.

At ﬁrst, we collect some results that will be used in the rest of this paper.

Lemma 1.1 ([1, Theorem 2.5]). Let f (x) ∈ Q[x] be such that f (Z) ⊆ Z, and let
m0, . . . , md be the unique integers such that

f (x) =

i + 1(cid:19) −(cid:18)x + i − mi

i + 1 (cid:19)(cid:19) ,

d

Xi=0 (cid:18)(cid:18)x + i

where d = deg(f (x)). Then f (x) is a Hilbert polynomial if and only if m0 ≥ m1 ≥
· · · ≥ md ≥ 0.

This is a numerical characterization of Hilbert polynomials. We call the integers
m0, . . . , md uniquely determined by Lemma 1.1 the Macaulay parameters of f (x),
and we write M(f (x)) = (m0, . . . , md).

Lemma 1.2 ([1, Theorem 3.5]). Let f (x), g(x) ∈ Q[x] be two Hilbert polynomials
and let k be a positive integer. Then the following are Hilbert polynomials:

(i) f (x) + g(x);
(ii) f (x)g(x);
(iii) kf (x);

This lemma gives some fundamental operations on polynomials that preserve the

property of being Hilbert polynomials.

By using lemmas, we obtain the following proposition.

Proposition 1.3. Let d be a non-negative integer and k a positive integer. We set
f (x) = kxd. Then f (x) is a Hilbert polynomial if and only if one of the followings
is satisﬁed:

(i) d = 0;
(ii) d = 1 and k ≥ 3;
(iii) d = 2 and k ≥ 3;
(iv) d ≥ 3.

Proof. It is known that when d = 0 or d ≥ 3, xd is a Hilbert polynomial and x and
x2 are not Hilbert polynomials. (See [1, Theorem 3.8].) By computing the Macaulay
parameters of 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x and 2x2, 3x2, 4x2, 5x2, from Lemma 1.1 we know 2x, 2x2
are not Hilbert polynomials and 3x, 4x, 5x, 3x2, 4x2, 5x2 are Hilbert polynomials.
Hence by Lemma 1.2, the assertion follows.

2. proof of Theorem 0.1

In this section, we will prove Theorem 0.1. At ﬁrst, we prove the following lemma.

Lemma 2.1. For any d ≥ 1, there exists a Hilbert polynomial f (x) ∈ Z[x] of degree
d such that S(f (x)) = {−1}d.

Proof. We let g(x) = 5x − 5 and h(x) = dx + 1. Then we have M(g(x)) = (5, 5)
and M(h(x)) = ((d2 − d + 2)/2, d). Hence by Lemma 1.1, g(x) and h(x) are Hilbert
polynomials. We set f (x) = g(x)h(x)d−1 ∈ Z[x]. Then by Lemma 1.2 (ii), f (x) is a
Hilbert polynomial and one obtains

= − 5 + 5

i (cid:19)dixi!
f (x) =(5x − 5)  d−1
Xi=0 (cid:18)d − 1
i − 1(cid:19) − d(cid:18)d − 1
di−1(cid:18)(cid:18)d − 1
Xi=1
di−1 (d − 1)!
Xi=1
i!(d − i)!

= − 5 + 5

d−1

d−1

i (cid:19)(cid:19) xi + 5dd−1xd

(i − d(d − i)) xi + 5dd−1xd

Since for 1 ≤ i ≤ d − 1, we have i − d(d − i) < 0. Hence we obtain Sf (x) = {−1}d,
as desired.

Now, we prove Theorem 0.1.

Proof of Theorem 0.1. By Lemma 2.1, there exists a Hilbert polynomial g(x) ∈ Z[x]
i=0 bixi. By Lemma 1.2 (iii),

of degree d such that S(g(x)) = {−1}d. Let g(x) = Pd

3

we can assume that for i = 0, . . . , d − 1, bi + 3 ≤ ai. Hence by Lemma 1.2 (i) and
Proposition 1.3, if k ≥ bd + 3, then f (x) is a Hilbert polynomial, as desired.
