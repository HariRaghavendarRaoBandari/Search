Nuclear spin-lattice relaxation times are measured on copper using magnetic resonance force mi-
croscopy performed at temperatures down to 42 mK. The low temperature is veriﬁed by comparison
with the Korringa relation. Measuring spin-lattice relaxation times locally at very low temperatures
opens up the possibility to measure the magnetic properties of inhomogeneous electron systems
realized in oxide interfaces, topological insulators and strongly correlated electron systems such as
high-Tc superconductors.

Among the most informative probes of electron sys-
tems in solids is the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate
1/T1. This value quantiﬁes the damping of the nuclear
spin precession due to the coupling to the electron spins.
This in turn can be related to the momentum averaged
imaginary part of the dynamical spin susceptibility of
the electron system, measured at the very low Larmor
frequency of the nuclear spins. This is a most useful
quantity revealing basic physics of the electron system.
For instance, in Fermi liquids like copper, the Korringa
relation [1], 1/(T1T ) = constant, universally holds, while
non-Korringa behaviors have played a pivotal role in es-
tablishing the unconventional nature of various strongly
interacting electron systems [2]. This mainstay of tra-
ditional NMR methods has been hampered by the fact
that it is a very weak signal that usually can only be
detected in bulk samples [3]. We will demonstrate here
an important step forward towards turning this into a
nanoscopic probe, by delivering proof of principle that
1/T1 can be measured at subKelvin temperatures using
Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy (MRFM). State of
the art MRFM has demonstrated an imaging resolution
of < 10 nm, a 100-million fold improvement in volume
resolution over bulk NMR, by detecting the proton spins
in a virus particle [4]. In their experiment the statisti-
cal polarization of the protons was measured, since the
Boltzmann polarization was too small to detect.

Measurements of the recovery of the Boltzmann polar-
ization after radiofrequent pulses relate directly to spin-
lattice relaxation times. The force gradient detection of
T1 was measured before in GaAs at temperatures down
to 4.8 K [5]. In this paper we demonstrate T1 measure-
ments (see Fig. 2(a)) at temperatures which are lower
by two orders of magnitude and a volume sensitivity of
three orders of magnitude larger. Furthermore we ob-
tain the temperature dependence of the relaxation time
T1 satisfying quantitatively the Korringa relation of cop-
per, see Fig. 3. This is a major step forward towards
the ultimate goal of a device that can measure variations
of T1 at the nanoscale to study the properties of the in-

homogeneous electron systems which are at the forefront
of modern condensed matter physics, such as the surface
states of topological insulators [6], oxide interfaces [7–10]
and strongly correlated electron systems [11] including
the high-Tc superconductors [12].

soft cantilever (Fig. 1(a)) to detect the force gradients
between sample spins and the tip. In most MRFM ap-
paratuses a laser is used to read out the motion of the
cantilever. The spins in the sample are manipulated us-
ing radio-frequent (RF) currents that are applied using a
copper or gold nanowire [13, 14]. The laser and large RF
currents in the copper or gold nanowires prevent exper-
iments at milliKelvin temperatures. To our knowledge,
sample temperatures below 4.2 K have not been veriﬁed,
only that the working temperature of the cryostat can
remain at 300 mK [4]. In our setup, a Superconducting
Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) [15–17] is used
combined with a superconducting RF wire (Fig. 1(b)).
This enables us to perform nuclear MRFM experiments
down to temperatures of 42 mK, and we are able to verify
that the sample indeed remains at this temperature.

The experimental setup closely resembles the one that
was recently used to measure the dangling bonds on a
silicon substrate [18]. The NdFeB magnetic particle is
3.43 ± 0.02 µm in diameter, and has a saturation mag-
netization of 1.15 T. The cantilever’s natural resonance
frequency is f0 = 3.0 kHz with a mechanical quality fac-
tor of Q0 = 2.8 · 104, when far away from the surface.
An in-house developed cryopositioning system is used to
move the cantilever relative to the sample with a range of
1 mm in all dimensions. The absolute position of the can-
tilever is measured using three capacitive sensors. The
sample holder is placed on a ﬁnestage which is used to
change the height of the sample in a range of 2.3 µm.

For the fabrication of the detection chip consisting of
a superconducting RF wire, a pickup coil, and the cop-
per sample, we started with a NbTiN ﬁlm on a silicon
wafer with its natural oxide. The ﬁlm has an average
thickness of 378 nm, a resistivity of 92 µΩ cm and a
critical temperature of 15.3 K. Using standard electron
beam lithography techniques, with a negative resist, we
patterned the RF wire structure and pick-up coil. We
used reactive ion etching in a SF6/O2 plasma to etch the
ﬁlm. The copper is sputtered with a thickness of 300 nm
and a roughness of 10 nm. In order to prevent oxidation
of the copper, a gold capping layer of 15 nm was sput-
tered while the sample remained in high vacuum. The
copper sample is thermalized using a patterned copper
wire leading to a large copper area, which is connected
to the sample holder via gold wire bonds. The sample
holder is connected to the mixing chamber of the dilution
refrigerator via a welded silver wire.
We positioned the cantilever above the copper, as indi-
cated by a small black dot in Fig. 1(b), close (7 ± 1 µm)
to the center of the RF wire and close (5 ± 1 µm) to
the pick up coil for suﬃcient signal strength. While ap-
proaching the copper, we measured an enormous drop
in the quality factor of the cantilever towards Q = 300
which strongly depends on the distance to the sample.
This is caused by eddy currents in the copper induced by

2

the magnetic ﬁelds of the magnetic particle attached to
the moving cantilever. The drop in quality factor limited
the minimal height above the surface, reducing the signal
strength.

Natural copper exists in two isotopes. Both isotopes
have a spin S = 3/2, 63Cu has a natural abundance of
69% and a gyromagnetic ratio 63γ/(2π) = 11.3 MHz/T
and 65Cu has a natural abundance of 31% and a gyro-
magnetic ratio 65γ/(2π) = 12.1 MHz/T. In fcc-copper
there is no quadrupolar coupling, since electric ﬁeld gra-
dients are zero given the cubic symmetry.

The magnetic particle on the cantilever couples to all
nuclear spins in the sample via it’s ﬁeld gradient. Ev-
ery spin eﬀectively shifts the resonance frequency of the
cantilever by an amount ∆fs. The alignment of the nu-
clear spins will be perturbed when a radio-frequent pulse
is applied to the sample. The spins that meet the reso-
nance condition fRF = γ
2π B0 are said to be in the res-
onance slice, where fRF is the RF frequency and B0
the local magnetic ﬁeld. The total frequency shift due
to all the spins within a resonance slice can be calcu-
lated by the summation of the single spin contributions
s ∆fs, where p is the net Boltzmann polariza-
tion of the nuclear spins. We present analytic expressions
for the single spin contributions and the outcome of the
summation over the resonance slice in the Supplemental
Material [19]. Those spins losing their net Boltzmann
polarization (i.e., p → 0) will cause a total frequency
shift of −∆f0. This eﬀect can be obtained at low radio
frequent magnetic ﬁelds in a saturation experiment with
low enough currents to prevent heating of the sample.

∆f0 = p(cid:80)

A RF current of 0.2 mA is applied in all measure-
ments. Taking the approximation of a circular wire, we
estimate the typical ﬁeld strength in the rotating frame
for a current of 0.2 mA at a distance r = 7 µm to be
4πr ≈ 2.9 µT. The RF-ﬁeld is mostly perpendic-
B1 = µ0I
ular to B0 (see Fig. 1(c)). The saturation parameter
s ≡ γ2B2
1 T1T2 [20] is used to calculate the ratio of to-
tal saturation which is given by s
1+s . For temperatures
T < 250 mK, the expected values for the relaxation times
are T1 > 5 s. Given a T2 = 0.15 ms [21], the saturation
parameter becomes s > 30, indicating that the spin satu-
ration will be at least 95%, for those spins that satisfy the
resonance condition. Since we work with ﬁeld gradients,
there will always be spins which are not fully saturated.
For the sake of simplicity, we assume that we have a res-
onance slice thickness d, within which the spins are fully
saturated. The Rabi frequency is γ
assume that for pulse lengths of 1 s all levels are fully
saturated. When all levels saturate, the magnetization
after a pulse will restore according to a single exponen-
tial, with a decay time equal to the spin-lattice relaxation
time T1. The frequency shift of the cantilever is pro-
portional to the magnetization, and the time dependent

2π B1 ≈ 30 Hz, so we

3

will be subject of further study, since for nanoscale imag-
ing based on (proton) density, the magnetic RF ﬁelds
need to be large (> 3 mT) enough for adiabatic rapid
passages [13]. In this Letter, we avoid the large currents
in order to prevent heating.

In Fig. 2(a) we show a representative plot of a satura-
tion recovery measurement performed at a temperature
of 42 mK and a RF frequency of 542 kHz. The cantilever
was positioned at a height of approximately 1.5 µm above
the surface of the copper. At fRF = 542 kHz, the mea-
sured frequency shifts were larger than those observed
at other frequencies. This is caused by the presence of
a higher resonance mode of the cantilever which can be
driven by the magnetic ﬁeld of the RF wire. The result-
ing increased motion of the magnetic particle at the end
of the cantilever gives an additional RF-ﬁeld that will in-
crease the number of spins that are saturated. The exact
mechanism for this will be presented in a diﬀerent paper
[23]. We measured the frequency shift up to t = 50 s and
averaged 50 times. Subsequently, the data is ﬁtted to Eq.
1 to extract ∆f0, T1 and a residual frequency oﬀset δf0
The direct frequency shift ∆f0 is plotted versus tem-
perature in Fig. 2(b) and ﬁtted with a straight line ac-
cording to the expected Curie’s law ∆f0 ∝ (cid:104)m(cid:105) ∝ 1
T ,
which implicitly assumes that the resonance slice thick-
ness is temperature independent. ∆f0 shows a saturation
at the lowest temperatures. This indicates that the (elec-
tron) spins are diﬃcult to cool, although the saturation
could also be caused by the approach of minimum tem-
perature of the refrigerator. For every temperature, we
collected at least three sets of 50 curves. The error bars
are the standard deviations calculated from the separate
ﬁts.

In Fig. 2(c) the direct frequency shift is plotted ver-
sus RF-frequency for three diﬀerent cantilever heights.
Every data point resembles a data set of 50 averaged
single measurements. The solid line is a numerical cal-
culation, with the only ﬁtting parameters the resonance
slice width and height of the cantilever above the surface.
The height of the cantilever is left a ﬁtting parameter,
because the absolute height is not known with suﬃcient
accuracy, due to the nonlinear behavior of the piezostack
in the ﬁnestage.

Several mechanisms will contribute to the resonance
slice thickness, for example the width of the resonant
slice is determined by the NMR line width, i.e. the satu-
ration parameter, and may be further broadened by the
nuclear spin diﬀusion and by the resonant displacement
of the cantilever. Below we discuss these various contri-
butions. [24]. This results in a variation of the thickness
at diﬀerent locations of the resonance slice. For the cal-
culations of this experiment we have taken the resonant
slice thickness to be uniform over the resonance slice.

For two diﬀerent RF-frequencies, 542 kHz and 625 kHz,
at two diﬀerent heights, 1.54 µm and 1.31 µm, we mea-
sured the relaxation time T1 versus temperature. The

FIG. 2. a) The saturating RF-pulse results in a direct fre-
quency shift ∆f0 of the cantilever’s resonance frequency. The
shift relaxes with the nuclear spin’s relaxation time T1. The
dashed orange line shows a single measurement of the fre-
quency shift (with a moving average of 1 second), the solid
blue line shows 50 averages. The red solid line is an expo-
nential ﬁt according to equation 1. From the ﬁt we extract
the direct shift ∆f0, relaxation time T1 and a residual fre-
quency oﬀset δf0. b) The direct frequency shift ∆f0 versus
temperature. The linear ﬁt is expected according to Curie’s
law (cid:104)m(cid:105) ∝ T −1, which implicitly assumes that the resonance
slice thickness is temperature independent. c) ∆f0 as func-
tion of RF-frequency fRF for three diﬀerent cantilever heights
at T = 42 mK. The solid line is the calculated signal with the
cantilever height h and resonance slice width d as parameters.
The two resonance slices of the two copper isotopes largely
overlap each other. The dashed vertical line at 542 kHz indi-
cated the location of a higher resonance mode, at which the
cantilever can be driven using the RF-frequency resulting in
an ampliﬁcation of the B1-ﬁeld and therefore the spin signal
(see main text).

resonance frequency f (t) becomes:

f (t) = f0 + ∆f0 · e−(t−t0)/T1

(1)

We use the Phase Locked Loop (PLL) of a Zurich Instru-
ments lock-in ampliﬁer to measure the shifts in resonance
frequency of the cantilever at a bandwidth of 40 Hz [22].
The measurement scheme is as follows: ﬁrst we measure
the natural resonance frequency f0 using a PLL. The
PLL is turned oﬀ and the RF-current is turned on for
one second. At t0 the RF current is turned oﬀ. Shortly
after the PLL is turned on and we measure the frequency
shift relative to f0. The PLL is switched oﬀ during and
shortly after the RF pulse in order to avoid crosstalk.

At frequencies larger than 1 MHz and currents higher
than 1 mA, we measure a milliKelvin increase in the tem-
perature of the sample. The dissipation of the RF wire

is also larger. Secondly, we improved the operation tem-
perature of the fridge, such that future experiments can
be performed at 10 mK.

By taking the ratio between the frequency noise within
a bandwidth of 1 Hz at a Q > 1000 and the frequency
shift of a single spin when the height between magnet
and sample is minimal, we ﬁnd a volume sensitivity of
(30 nm)3. Further improvements are possible when using
smaller magnets on the force sensor [25], which provide
much higher ﬁeld gradients. Previous measurements of
the relaxation time with MRFM [5] had a volume sensi-
tivity three orders of magnitude smaller [26]. Our volume
sensitivity is at least 4 orders of magnitude larger than
that can theoretically be achieved in bulk NMR, and even
10 orders larger than is usually reported in solid state
NMR [3]. Our results show that our technique is promis-
ing for studying the properties of inhomogenuous electron
systems, such as topological insulators, oxide interfaces
and strongly correlated electron systems.

FIG. 3. The inverse of the relaxation time of the copper nuclei
measured by applying saturation pulses versus temperature.
We ﬁnd the same linear dependence with temperature as is
found in bulk copper samples, the so called Korringa relation.
In blue: data measured at a height of 1.54 µm at 542 kHz,
where a larger signal was achieved due to ampliﬁcation of
the RF-ﬁeld by an higher cantilever mode.
In green: data
recorded at 1.31 µm at a frequency of 625 kHz. We ﬁnd κ =
1.0± 0.1 sK and κ = 0.9± 0.2 sK respectively with a linear ﬁt
with the error indicating the 95% conﬁdence intervals. Every
data point is an average of at least three sets of averaged
data. The error bars give the standard deviation of the found
relaxation times for the averaged data sets.

results are shown in Fig. 3. We observe a linear depen-
dence of T1 on the temperature, following the Korringa
law T1T = κ. T is the electron temperature and κ is
the Korringa constant. From the linear ﬁts we extract
κ = 1.0 ± 0.1 sK and κ = 0.9 ± 0.2 sK, which is close
to the expected value of the combined 63Cu and 65Cu
Korringa constants, κ = 1.2 sK [21], which is measured
in bulk copper.

In conclusion, by performing nuclear magnetic reso-
nance force microscopy experiments down to 42 mK, we
have demonstrated that the nuclear spin-lattice relax-
ation time T1 can be detected by measuring the spin po-
larization in a volume of about 3000 × 3000 × 30 nm3,
see Fig. 1(c). A much smaller volume would give the
same signal-to-noise ratio when a diﬀerent sample than
copper is measured and a smaller magnetic particle is
used. First, copper is such a good conductor that our
experiment is hampered by the eddy currents generated
in the copper due to the motion of the magnetic force
sensor. The subsequent drop in quality factor increases
the frequency noise in the measurements with an order
of magnitude. This prevented us from performing exper-
iments at smaller tip-sample heights. When the magnet
is closer to the sample, the magnetization of the nuclei
