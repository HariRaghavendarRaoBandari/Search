DEFORMATION OF EINSTEIN METRICS AND L2 COHOMOLOGY ON

STRICTLY PSEUDOCONVEX DOMAINS

YOSHIHIKO MATSUMOTO

Abstract. We construct new complete Einstein metrics on a smoothly bounded strictly pseu-
doconvex domain of a Stein manifold. The approach that we take here is to deform the K¨ahler-
Einstein metric constructed by Cheng and Yau, which generalizes a work of Biquard on the
deformations of the complex hyperbolic metric on the unit ball. Recasting the problem into
the question of vanishing of an L2 cohomology and taking advantage of the asymptotic com-
plex hyperbolicity of the Cheng–Yau metric, we establish the possibility of such a deformation
when the dimension is at least three.

Introduction

Let Ω be a smoothly bounded strictly pseudoconvex domain of a Stein manifold of dimension
n ≥ 2. It is shown by Cheng and Yau [13] that then Ω carries a complete K¨ahler-Einstein metric g
with negative scalar curvature, which is unique up to homothety. This metric has attracted much
interest in connection with CR geometry of the boundary ∂Ω. Actually, the induced CR structure
on ∂Ω, which is called the conformal inﬁnity of g in our context, locally and asymptotically
determines the metric g up to some high order, as ﬁrst pointed out by Feﬀerman [20] and further
investigated by Graham [23]. It is a version of bulk-boundary correspondence, which is more
extensively studied in the setting of asymptotically real hyperbolic (or asymptotically anti-de
Sitter) metrics.

It was the idea of Biquard [5] that one can push forward the complex bulk-boundary corre-
spondence toward asymptotically complex hyperbolic (ACH) Einstein metrics and CR structures
that are not necessarily integrable. Those that are admitted as conformal inﬁnities in the new
setting are called partially integrable CR structures in the literature (see [8, 9]).

What Biquard showed in [5] was the perturbative existence and uniqueness result on the
for any partially integrable CR structure J on the sphere S2n−1 suﬃciently “close” to
ball:
the standard one, there exists an Einstein ACH metric on the unit ball Bn ⊂ Cn “close” to
the complex hyperbolic metric, which is “locally unique” up to diﬀeomorphism action, whose
conformal inﬁnity is J. This result is parallel to that of Graham and Lee [24] for asymptotically
real hyperbolic Einstein metrics.

In this paper, we take up the same perturbation problem on an arbitrary bounded strictly
pseudoconvex domain. Our seed metric is the Cheng–Yau metric. We can establish the following
generalization of Biquard’s result provided the dimension n is at least three.

Theorem 0.1. Let Ω be a smoothly bounded strictly pseudoconvex domain of a Stein manifold
of dimension n ≥ 3. Suppose that J is a partially integrable CR structure on the boundary ∂Ω

suﬃciently close to the standard one in the C2,α topology. Then there exists an Einstein ACH
metric g on Ω with conformal inﬁnity J . The metric g is locally unique modulo the action of
diﬀeomorphisms on Ω inducing the identity on ∂Ω.

Here we are implicitly assuming that the underlying contact structure of J is the standard one,
so that the C2,α-closeness between J and the standard CR structure is well-deﬁned. As contact
structures on closed manifolds are rigid (see Gray [25]), no generality is lost by this assumption.
The uniqueness is precisely stated as follows using the weighted H¨older space (see Subsection
if g is our metric and ˆg is another Einstein ACH metric such that ˆg − g ∈
1.2 for details):
C2,α
(S2T ∗Ω) for some δ > 0 (which in particular implies that their conformal inﬁnities are the
same), then there exists a diﬀeomorphism Φ ∈ Diﬀ(Ω) that is at least continuous up to the
boundary and restricts to the identity on ∂Ω for which Φ∗ˆg = g. This uniqueness part is not a
new result; it is discussed in [5, Proposition I.4.6].

δ

Our proof of the existence is based on Biquard’s framework. Namely, the proof is done by
applying the inverse function theorem to a mapping between Banach spaces that is exactly the
one considered in [5]. Then the problem becomes to see if the linearization of the mapping in
question is isomorphic. This is relatively easy for the complex hyperbolic metric on the unit ball;
on the other hand, for general domains, it is not at all obvious. Here lies the main issue of our
discussion.

Let us get into some more details. We consider the following Bianchi-gauged Einstein equation

in order to get rid of the diﬀeomorphism invariance of the Einstein equation:

(0.1)

Eg(h) := Ric(g + h) − λ(g + h) + δ∗

g+hBgh = 0,

Bgh := δgh +

1
2

d trg h.

Here g denotes some ACH metric, h is a symmetric 2-tensor that is “small” compared to g (so
that g + h remains to be a metric in particular), δg is the divergence with respect to g, and δ∗
g+h
is the formal adjoint of δg+h with respect to g + h. What we shall need is that the linearization
E ′
g of the gauged Einstein operator (0.1) associated to the Cheng–Yau metric g = gCY at h = 0
is an isomorphism between certain weighted H¨older spaces of symmetric 2-tensors. An upshot
of Biquard’s theory (see also Lee [30] for the AH case) is that this isomorphism follows once the
vanishing of the L2 kernel of E ′
g, is
called the obstruction space of Einstein deformation.

g is established. Therefore, the L2 kernel, denoted by kerL2 E ′

The linearization E ′

g for an Einstein metric g turns out to be the following operator, where ˚R

denotes the usual action of the curvature tensor on symmetric 2-tensors:

(0.2)

E ′
g =

1
2

(∇∗∇ − 2 ˚R).

This expression shows, in particular, that the L2 kernel vanishes when g has negative sectional
curvature everywhere (hence we get the result for the unit ball). The problem is that we cannot
expect this level of knowledge for general Cheng–Yau metrics. However, the asymptotic curvature
behavior of gCY at inﬁnity is known quite well: the holomorphic sectional curvature uniformly
tends to a negative constant. This suggests that we can conquer the diﬃculty if it is reduced to
an analysis near inﬁnity in a suitable way.

Our crucial idea is to use Koiso’s observation [29]. Note ﬁrst that any symmetric 2-tensor σ
can be decomposed into the sum of hermitian and anti-hermitian parts: σ = σH + σA. For a
K¨ahler-Einstein metric g, (0.2) shows that this decomposition is respected by E ′
g. Now the duality
induced by the metric identiﬁes σA with a (0, 1)-form α with values in the holomorphic tangent
bundle T 1,0. Under this identiﬁcation, it turns out that E ′

gσA corresponds to 1

little bit of further consideration leads to the conclusion that the vanishing of the obstruction
space follows from

(0.3)

L2H0,1(Ω; T 1,0) = 0,

where the left-hand side is the space of L2 harmonic T 1,0-valued (0, 1)-forms on Ω with respect
to the Cheng–Yau metric.

By the de Rham–Hodge–Kodaira decomposition on noncompact manifolds, L2H0,1(Ω; T 1,0) is
isomorphic to the so-called reduced L2 cohomology L2H 0,1
red(Ω; T 1,0). Although it may not be the
same as the usual L2 cohomology L2H 0,1(Ω; T 1,0), it is a trivial fact that if L2H 0,1 vanishes then
so does L2H 0,1
red. Thus the vanishing of L2H0,1(Ω; T 1,0) reduces to that of the L2 cohomology.
A virtue of this reduction in terms of cohomology is that we have a certain long exact sequence
(see Ohsawa [34]) that makes it suﬃcient to show that the L2 cohomology on a neighborhood of
the boundary vanishes. This problem, which is a version of the ∂-Neumann problem, is solved
by applying the Bochner-type method of Morrey–Kohn–H¨ormander when n ≥ 4.

For n = 3, we need an additional idea: we can further reduce the vanishing of kerL2 E ′

g to
that of a weighted L2 cohomology. This is made possible by using a result of Biquard [5] again,
which states that the elements of kerL2 E ′
g on a general ACH-Einstein manifold actually satisfy
a stronger decay condition at inﬁnity than just being L2; in our context, in which we are aiming
for the vanishing result, we might be able to say to express this fact that these elements have
an a priori decay. Then the introduction of the weight improves our estimate enough to show
the desired vanishing result. Unfortunately, the case n = 2 cannot be settled even if we use this
additional technique; this case remains unsolved so far.

The argument outlined above is presented in detail in the following way. In Section 1, we
summarize the deﬁnition of ACH metrics and the associated weighted H¨older spaces. After that
Biquard’s Einstein deformation theory is recalled, and the a priori decay for the elements of
kerL2 E ′
g is explained. In Section 2, we review the L2 cohomology on complete K¨ahler manifolds,
and the reduction of the problem to the vanishing of the L2 cohomology near the boundary is
done. In Section 3, we establish the necessary estimate and complete the proof of Theorem 0.1.
We include an appendix, in which we give yet another proof of a result of Donnelly and
Feﬀerman [16] on L2 harmonic (scalar-valued) diﬀerential forms using the a priori decay tech-
nique. In fact, via this technique, the vanishing part of the Donnelly–Feﬀerman theorem boils
down to the vanishing of some weighted L2 cohomologies, which we can prove by the standard
Bochner–Kodaira–Nakano formula.

Most of this work was carried out during the author’s stay at ´Ecole normale sup´erieure at
Paris in 2014–15. I wish to thank Olivier Biquard for hosting the visit and for giving a lot of
insightful advice, which substantially improved my comprehension of geometric analysis of ACH
metrics. I would also like to express my gratitude to the staﬀ of ENS and Tokyo Institute of
Technology, especially to Lara Morise and Akiko Takagi, for various practical help during the
stay. I was beneﬁted from discussions with Masanori Adachi and Tomoyuki Hisamoto in an early
stage of the project. Gilles Carron suggested the idea of using the approach of the ∂-Neumann
problem; on this point Takeo Ohsawa helped me with clarifying my understanding of the relevant
exact sequence. Shin-ichi Matsumura pointed out a redundant argument that had existed in an
earlier version of the manuscript.

1. Einstein deformation theory of asymptotically complex hyperbolic metrics

1.1. The Cheng–Yau metric. Cheng and Yau considered the Calabi problem on noncompact
complex manifolds in [13]. In particular, they established the following theorem.

4

YOSHIHIKO MATSUMOTO

Theorem 1.1 (Cheng–Yau [13]). Let Ω be a smoothly bounded strictly pseudoconvex domain of
a Stein manifold of dimension n ≥ 2. Then, for each ﬁxed λ < 0, there exists a unique complete
K¨ahler metric g on Ω satisfying Ric(g) = λg.

Such a metric is constructed by solving the complex Monge–Amp`ere equation. More speciﬁ-
cally, normalizing the metric by setting λ = −(n + 1), we can obtain such an Einstein metric in
the form g = gij dzidzj with

(1.1)

gij =

∂2(− log ϕ)

∂zi∂zj + hij ,

where ϕ ∈ C∞(Ω) ∩ Cn+1,α(Ω) is a positive deﬁning function of Ω and hij is a hermitian
symmetric form on the ambient Stein manifold Y ; when Y = Cn one can always take hij = 0.
In what follows, by the Cheng–Yau metric, this one is always referred to. The uniqueness of the
metric [13, Theorem 8.3] follows from Yau’s Schwarz Lemma for volume forms [33, Section 1].

In the paper of Cheng and Yau, the existence and the boundary regularity of ϕ is stated
explicitly only for domains of Cn and of K¨ahler manifolds admitting metrics of negative Ricci
curvature. To see that their result extends to the case of domains of Stein manifolds, take a
positive deﬁning function ψ ∈ C∞(Ω) so that −ψ is strictly plurisubharmonic on Ω. Let g′ be a
K¨ahler metric on Y such that gij = ∂i∂j(− log ψ) − rij > 0 on Ω, where (n + 1)rij is the Ricci
tensor of g′. Then by [13, Theorem 4.4], there exists a function u ∈ C∞(Ω) for which gij + uij
is a metric that is quasi-equivalent to gij and

det(gij + uij)

det(gij )

= e(n+1)u+F

with

F = log(cid:18) det(g′

ψn+1 det(gij )(cid:19) .

ij)

Then it can be seen that gij + uij is an Einstein K¨ahler metric. The boundary regularity of ϕ =
e−uψ can be shown by slightly modifying [13, Section 6]; see also van Coevering [36, Subsection
3.4] discussing a similar case.

A direct computation shows that the holomorphic sectional curvature of the Cheng–Yau met-
ric (1.1) uniformly tends to −2 at inﬁnity (see [13, Equation (1.22)] for the case Y = Cn).
Namely,

(1.2)

Rijkl = −(gij gkl + gilgkj ) + o(1)

at ∂Ω,

where the notation o(1) means that this term has pointwise norm (with respect to g) that tends
to zero uniformly at ∂Ω. Moreover, the Cheng–Yau metric g has bounded geometry in the
sense that its injectivity radius rinj is positive and the curvature tensor, as well as its covariant
derivative of arbitrary order, is bounded (cf. [11, 35]). One way to show that rinj > 0 is applying
a result of Ammann–Lauter–Nistor [1, Proposition 4.19]; actually, one can further show that the
pointwise injectivity radius at p ∈ Ω tends to inﬁnity as p approaches ∂Ω. The boundedness
of ∇mR, m ≥ 0, can be seen by reducing it to the same property of the preliminary metric
∂i∂j(− log ψ) − rij , which follows by an explicit computation that makes use of the local frame
employed in [32, Subsection 5.1]. The reduction is justiﬁed because ∇mu is bounded for any
m as shown in the proof of [13, Theorem 4.4]. Alternatively, one can use the existence of an
asymptotic expansion of ϕ involving logarithmic terms established by Lee–Melrose [31].

Here M is a closed strictly pseudoconvex partially integrable CR manifold (see, e.g., [32]). Recall
that an almost CR manifold (M, H, J) is said to be partially integrable if

[Γ(T 1,0M ), Γ(T 1,0M )] ⊂ Γ(T 1,0M ⊕ T 1,0M ),

where T 1,0M ⊂ CH is the i-eigenbundle of J ∈ End(H). The Levi form Lθ is deﬁned as usual
for any 1-form θ that exactly annihilates H, and so is the notion of strict pseudoconvexity of
(M, H, J). In formula (1.3), θ is always taken so that the Levi form Lθ is positive deﬁnite. We
call such a θ a pseudohermitian structure.

Using the model metric (1.3), we deﬁne as follows (see also Biquard [5], Biquard–Mazzeo [6]).

Deﬁnition 1.2. Let X be a noncompact smooth manifold of real dimension 2n, where n ≥ 2,
which compactiﬁes into a smooth manifold-with-boundary X. Then a Riemannian metric g on
X is called asymptotically complex hyperbolic (or ACH for short) if there exists a diﬀeomorphism
between a neighborhood of M := ∂X in X and M × [0, ε) under which there is some strictly
pseudoconvex partially integrable CR structure (H, J) and a pseudohermitian structure θ on M
such that

g = g0 + k,

δ

(S2T ∗X)

for some δ > 0, where g0 is the model metric (1.3) for (M, H, J, θ). The partially integrable CR
structure (H, J), or J, is called the conformal inﬁnity of g.

Here the space

C2,α

δ

(S2T ∗X) := xδC2,α(S2T ∗X)

is the weighted H¨older space of symmetric 2-tensors on X with respect to g0. In order to deﬁne
the Ck,α H¨older norm of a section s of a tensor bundle E, we use the fact that there is a
radius rconv > 0, which is smaller or equal to rinj, such that any two points p, q ∈ X satisfying
d(p, q) < rconv is connected by a unique minimizing geodesic [7]. Upon ﬁxing a parameter
r < rconv, we deﬁne

kskC α := sup|s| + sup

dist(p,q)<r

|Πp→q(s(p)) − s(q)|

dist(p, q)α

where Πp→q : Ep → Eq is the parallel transport along the minimizing geodesic from p to q, and

(E), we deﬁne

kskC k,α :=

:= kx−δskC k,α.

Another choice of r gives an equivalent norm; hence the space Ck,α

δ

(E) remains unchanged.

Since g0 has bounded geometry (as one can show in the same way as in the previous subsec-
tion), an equivalent H¨older norm can also be deﬁned in terms of the trivialization with respect
to geodesic coordinate charts, for which there exists uniform constants c > 0 and cm > 0 such
that

(here the indices correspond to real coordinates) by the result of Eichhorn [18]. One can further
use any uniformly locally ﬁnite coordinate charts { (Uλ, Φλ) }, where Φλ maps Uλ ⊂ X onto the
open ball Br(0) ⊂ R2n of radius r > 0 (independent of λ) centered at the origin, such that (1.5)
holds and { Φ−1
λ (Br/2(0)) } covers X. This implies in particular that a similar approach to that
of “M¨obius coordinates” taken by Lee [30] in the AH case can also be used; consequently, the
H¨older spaces deﬁned by any two diﬀerent choices of (J, θ) are actually the same.

The Cheng–Yau metric g on a smoothly bounded strictly pseudoconvex domain Ω can be
regarded as an ACH metric in the sense of Deﬁnition 1.2 via the “square root construction” of
Epstein–Melrose–Mendoza [19] (see also [32, Example 2.4]). In this case, the compactiﬁcation
X is topologically Ω, but the C∞-structure is replaced so that the square roots of boundary
deﬁning functions are regarded as smooth. Therefore, in this case,

Ck,α

δ

(S2T ∗X) = ϕδ/2Ck,α(S2T ∗X),

where ϕ is any smooth positive deﬁning function of Ω. Although the identity map ι : X → Ω
does not have smooth inverse, its restriction to the interior X and to the boundary ∂X are
diﬀeomorphisms onto Ω and ∂Ω, respectively. Thus ∂X is identiﬁed with ∂Ω. The conformal
inﬁnity of g is actually the standard CR structure on ∂Ω, i.e., the one induced from the complex
structure of the ambient Stein manifold.

1.3. Einstein deformations. Let g be an arbitrary ACH metric on X satisfying the Einstein
equation, which is in fact forced to be

Ric(g) = −(n + 1)g.

The conformal inﬁnity of g, which is a partially integrable CR structure on M = ∂X, is denoted
by (H, J).

Take a neighborhood of J in the set of all C2,α partially integrable CR structures admitted
by the contact distribution H. This is identiﬁed with a neighborhood of the origin in the H¨older
space C2,α(S2
A(∧1,0M )) of anti-hermitian symmetric 2-tensors over T 1,0M . The identiﬁcation is
given as follows: for ψ ∈ C2,α(S2
A(∧1,0M )) with suﬃciently small norm (with respect to the Levi
form Lθ for J and some ﬁxed pseudohermitian structure θ), expressed as ψαβ with respect to a
local frame { Zα } of T 1,0M , the vector bundle

ψ M = span { Zα + ψ β
T 1,0

α Zβ }

deﬁnes the corresponding C2,α partially integrable CR structure Jψ, where the second index
of ψ is raised by the Levi form and Einstein’s summation convention is observed. We write
Jψ = J + ψ.

We ﬁrst consider a preliminary extension of Jψ to an ACH metric gψ. Identify a neighborhood
of ∂X with M × [0, ε) so that g is as in (1.4). Fix a cutoﬀ function χ ∈ C∞(X) that equals 1
near ∂X and is supported in M × [0, ε). Let ˜ψ be the diﬀerence of the Levi forms of J and Jψ
with respect to θ, and set

gψ = g +

χ ˜ψ
x2 .

If kψkC 2,α is suﬃciently small, then gψ becomes a (non-smooth) ACH metric with conformal
inﬁnity Jψ. Note that g0 = g. The metric gψ is approximately Einstein in the sense that

hence it is trivial that Egψ (0) ∈ C0,α

We shall prove that this is bijective near the origin; then the inverse image of (ψ, 0) contains only
one element (ψ, σψ) close to the origin, for which the metric gψ + σψ is an Einstein ACH metric
with conformal inﬁnity Jψ by [5, Lemme I.1.4]. By the inverse function theorem, it suﬃces to
show that the linearization of Q is an isomorphism between the Banach spaces. Since the ﬁrst
component of Q is just the identity map, what we have to verify is that

(1.8)

is isomorphic.

The Fredholm theory of ACH metrics [5] shows that the operator (1.8) is an isomorphism
g understood as an

if and only if the L2 kernel vanishes. Here the L2 kernel is the kernel of E ′
unbounded operator with domain

dom E ′

g := { α ∈ L2(S2T ∗X) | E ′

gα ∈ L2(S2T ∗X) } ,
which is called the maximal closed extension. Thus the space kerL2 E ′
g is called the obstruc-
tion space of Einstein deformations, and when it vanishes g is called nondegenerate. We can
summarize the discussion so far as in the next proposition (the uniqueness statement follows
from [5, Proposition I.4.6]).

Proposition 1.3 (Biquard [5, Th´eor`eme I.4.8]). Let g be a nondegenerate Einstein ACH metric
with conformal inﬁnity J . Then, for any ψ ∈ C2,α(S2
A(∧1,0M )) close enough to zero, there exists
an Einstein ACH metric g′ whose conformal inﬁnity is Jψ = J + ψ. The metric g′ is locally
unique in the sense that any Einstein ACH metric lying in a suﬃciently small C2,α
-neighborhood
of g′ pulls back to g′ by a diﬀeomorphism on X inducing the identity on ∂X.

δ

In the rest of this subsection, we describe the fact that kerL2 E ′

g = 0 implies the isomorphicity of
(1.8) in the context of general theory of geometrically deﬁned elliptic linear diﬀerential operators
for ACH metrics.

Let P : Γ(E) → Γ(F ) be a elliptic diﬀerential operator of order m, where E and F are
subbundles of (T X)⊗s ⊗ (T ∗X)⊗t invariant under the action of O(2n) (the group O(2n) can be
replaced by U (n) for K¨ahler ACH metrics), with a universal expression in terms of the Levi-
Civita covariant diﬀerentiation and the actions of the curvature tensor of g. Such an operator is
called geometric. A consequence of this assumption is that P determines a well-deﬁned mapping

δ (E) := xδH k(E).

Another virtue of the geometricity is that it allows us to consider the operator P also on CH n.
Then we can formulate the following coercivity assumption, which is crucial in the next lemma:

Its validity for P = E ′

g is obvious from (0.2).

We need in addition to introduce a nonnegative real number RP called the indicial radius of
P . For this, we again consider the operator P on CH n. Fixing an origin o ∈ CH n identiﬁes a
subgroup G = U (n) of the group of isomorphisms G0 = PSU (n, 1), which gives the expression

CH n ∼= G0/G.

Then E and F are expressed as the associated bundles G0 ×G V and G0 ×G W , respectively,
where V and W are representations of G. Furthermore, we ﬁx a unit tangent vector v0 ∈ ToCH n
at the origin o, and let γ(r) = exp(rv0) be the geodesic that it determines. Then the isotropy
subgroup of the G-action on ToCH n gives a subgroup H = U (n − 1) ⊂ G. To state it diﬀerently,
H is the isotropy subgroup of the G-action on the sphere at inﬁnity S2n−1 about the limit point
of γ. Thus

We introduce an identiﬁcation

S2n−1 ∼= G/H.

CH n \ { o } ∼= S2n−1 × (0, ∞)

that maps g · γ(r) to the pair (gH, r), where g ∈ G. Then, restricted on each concentric sphere
Sr := S2n−1 × { r }, the vector bundle E can be seen as a homogeneous bundle over G/H. If we
identify the ﬁber Eγ(r) with V = Eo by the parallel transport along γ, then

E|Sr

∼= G ×H V.

Therefore, a section of E (over CH n \ { o }) can be identiﬁed with a function on G × (0, ∞) with
values in V that is H-equivariant. A similar identiﬁcation can be introduced for sections of F .
We can write P down in terms of this expression of sections of E and F . Then it follows from
[5, Equation (I.1.2)] that the derivatives tangent to G vanish at the limit r → ∞. In fact, P
has the following form, where each ai(r) is a function with values in the space HomH (V, W ) of
H-equivariant linear mappings V → W :

P = a0(r)∂m

r + a1(r)∂m−1

r

+ · · · + am(r) + O(e−r).

As r → ∞, the coeﬃcients ai(r) have well-deﬁned limits ai ∈ HomH (V, W ). A number s ∈ C is
called an indicial root of P when

IP (s) := (−1)ma0sm + (−1)m−1a1sm−1 + · · · + am ∈ HomH (V, W )

fails to be injective. Intuitively, the set ΣP of indicial roots is such that any solution of P u = 0
is expected to behave asymptotically like u ∼ u0e−sr for some s ∈ ΣP and a section u0 over
S2n−1.

For the formal adjoint operator P ∗ : Γ(F ) → Γ(E), we can show that

IP ∗ (s) = IP (2n − s)∗.

The number 2n should be understood as the twice the borderline weight of being in the L2 space.
(See also Lee [30, Proposition 4.4] for the AH case, in which the “weight of the tensor bundle”
appears in the formula just because the value of the parameter s is shifted). In particular, when
P is formally self-adjoint, then the indicial roots appear symmetrically about the line Re s = n.

A more primitive, though probably less insightful, calculation is given in [32, Lemma 5.4].
The operator ∆L + n + 2 that appears there is nothing but E ′
g up to a constant factor (note that
ACH manifolds in [32] has real dimension 2n + 2). Let us recall this computation for the spacial
case of CH n, as it suﬃces for our purpose. Rather than using the unit ball model, we identify
CH n with H2n−1 × (0, ∞), where H2n−1 is the Heisenberg group, so that the complex hyperbolic
metric is given by formula (1.3) with the standard pseudohermitian structure θ. Let T be the
Reeb vector ﬁeld on H2n−1 and { Z1, . . . , Zn−1 } a local frame of the CR holomorphic tangent
bundle. If we set Zτ := 1
2 x∂x + ix2T and Zα := xZα, α = 1, . . . , n− 1, then { Zτ , Z1, . . . , Zn−1 }
is a local frame of T 1,0CH n and the Christoﬀel symbols are given by [32, Equations (5.2)]. We
compute the action of E ′

g using this frame. Then we obtain, for example,

(E ′

gσ)αβ = −

x∂x(x∂x − 2n)σαβ + O(x) · (derivatives of σ in the H2n−1-direction).

Although the hypersurfaces Hx = H2n−1 × { x } and the concentric spheres Sr in the unit ball
model are diﬀerent, if we identify the geodesic γ(r) with the preimage of the origin 0 ∈ H2n−1
by the ﬁrst projection H2n−1 × (0, ∞) → H2n−1, then the tangent spaces of Hx and of Sr are the
same along this geodesic. From this one can conclude that the indicial roots on the component
S2
C(Cn−1)∗ is as described in the previous paragraph. The other roots can also be
read oﬀ from [32, Equations (5.9)].

C(Cn−1)∗ → S2

Anyway, by Proposition 1.4, the mappings (1.10) and (1.11) for the linearized gauged Einstein
operator are isomorphic for |δ| < n if the L2 kernel vanishes. Proposition 1.3 follows by taking δ
close to −n. We remark, on the other hand, that our conclusion for δ > 0 can be seen as giving
an a priori decay of the elements of kerL2 E ′
g, which has applications in the proof of the main
theorem for n = 3 and in the appendix.

2. Infinitesimal Einstein deformations and L2 cohomology

2.1. Inﬁnitesimal Einstein deformations on K¨ahler manifolds. Let us consider the lin-
earized gauged Einstein operator E ′
g of a complete Einstein K¨ahler metric g with Einstein constant
λ < 0 deﬁned on a complex manifold Ω with dimension n. Thanks to the complex structure,
any symmetric 2-tensor σ ∈ Γ(S2T ∗Ω) decomposes into the sum of the hermitian and the anti-
hermitian parts: σ = σH + σA. By deﬁnition, these two summands satisfy

σH (J·, J·) = σH (·, ·)

and σA(J·, J·) = −σA(·, ·),

where J denotes the almost complex structure endomorphism. The hermitian (resp. anti-
hermitian) part of S2T ∗Ω will be denoted by S2
AT ∗Ω). This decomposition is
respected by E ′
g, for the curvature of the K¨ahler metric has only components of the type Rijkl.
g on each component based on Koiso’s observation [29, Section
7] (see also Besse [4, Section 12.J]). First, we identify any hermitian symmetric form σH with
the diﬀerential (1, 1)-form σH (·, J·), which is denoted by σH ◦ J. Then the action of E ′
g on the
hermitian part is related to that of the Hodge–de Rham Laplacian ∆d as follows:

We discuss the action of E ′

H T ∗Ω (resp. S2

(E ′

gσH ) ◦ J =

1
2

(∆d − 2λ)(σH ◦ J).

On complete manifolds, by a result of Gaﬀney [22] it is known that ∆d is essentially self-adjoint,
meaning that it has unique self-adjoint extension. In particular, the maximal closed extension of
∆d agrees with dd∗ + d∗d (where d also acts distributionally). Therefore, since λ < 0, it follows
that

(2.1)

kerL2 E ′

g ∩ L2(S2

H T ∗Ω) = 0.

Second, the action of E ′
A + σ0,2
σ2,0
with a (0, 1)-form with values in T 1,0 = T 1,0Ω, which is denoted by g−1 ◦ σ0,2

g on the anti-hermitian part σA is reinterpreted as follows. Let σA =
A through the metric duality

A be the type decomposition of σA, and we identify σ0,2

A . Then

(2.2)

g−1 ◦ (E ′

gσA)0,2 =

∆∂ (g−1 ◦ σ0,2

A ).

By (2.1) and (2.2), we have a natural identiﬁcation

(2.3)

kerL2 E ′
g

∼= L2H0,1(T 1,0),

where L2H0,1(T 1,0) is the space of L2 harmonic T 1,0-valued (0, 1)-forms:

L2H0,1(T 1,0) := { α ∈ L2∧0,1(T 1,0) | ∂α = 0, ∂∗α = 0 } = { α ∈ L2∧0,1(T 1,0) | ∆∂α = 0 } .

The latter equality follows from the essential self-adjointness of ∆∂ due to Chernoﬀ [14].

2.2. Reduction to L2 cohomology. The Hodge–Kodaira decomposition on noncompact com-
plete Hermitian manifolds reads as follows, where E is an arbitrary hermitian holomorphic vector
bundle (see, e.g., Carron [10]):

L2∧p,q(Ω; E) = L2Hp,q(Ω; E) ⊕ im ∂p,q−1 ⊕ im ∂∗

p,q+1;

here

∂ = ∂p,q : L2∧p,q(Ω; E) → L2∧p,q+1(Ω; E)

is the maximal closed extension of ∂ acting on compactly supported smooth (p, q)-forms. There-
fore, the space L2Hp,q(Ω; E) is isomorphic to the so-called reduced L2 cohomology:

L2Hp,q(Ω; E) ∼= L2H p,q

red(Ω; E) := ker ∂p,q/ im ∂p,q−1.

DEFORMATION OF EINSTEIN METRICS AND L2 COHOMOLOGY

11

The reduced cohomology can be diﬀerent from the usual L2 cohomology

L2H p,q(Ω; E) := ker ∂p,q/ im ∂p,q−1.

However, it is clear that L2H p,q(Ω; E) = 0 implies L2H p,q
the usual L2 cohomology to get a result on harmonic forms.

red(Ω; E) = 0. Therefore we can consider

Let us recall an exact sequence for L2 cohomologies. Since an inclusion K ⊂ K ′ between
compact subsets of Ω induces a homomorphism L2H p,q(Ω \ K; E) → L2H p,q(Ω \ K ′; E) by
restriction, we may deﬁne the inductive limit

L2H p,q(Ω \ K; E),

lim
−→
K

where K runs through the compact subsets of Ω. Then we obtain the following exact sequence
(cf. Ohsawa [34]):
· · · → H p,q

L2H p,q(Ω \ K; E) → H p,q+1

(Ω; E) → · · · .

c

(Ω; E) → L2H p,q(Ω; E) → lim

Here H p,q

(Ω; E) denotes the cohomology with compact support.

Now suppose that Ω is a Stein manifold. Then by a result of Andreotti–Vesentini [2, Theorem
(Ω; E) vanishes for any hermitian vector bundle E. Therefore, by (2.3) and the exact

5], H 0,1
sequence above, the vanishing of kerL2 E ′

In this case, we

is some β ∈ L2
Now since ∂∗α = 0, we obtain ∂∗∂β = 0, which implies α = ∂β = 0. Thus we can conclude that
L2H0,1(Ω; T 1,0) vanishes, and so does the obstruction space kerL2 E ′
g.

3. Proof of main theorem

We shall prove that (2.6) holds for n ≥ 3; thus our main theorem follows by Proposition 1.3.
In the course of the proof of (2.6), we will also see that (2.4) holds when n ≥ 4. Therefore, the
only case one really has to consider the weighted cohomology is when n = 3.

Since the L2 cohomology is invariant for quasi-equivalent metrics, we can replace the Cheng–
Yau metric g with the metric ˜g expressed as ˜gij = ∂i∂j (− log ˜ϕ), where ˜ϕ ∈ C∞(Ω) is a smooth
positive deﬁning function. This simpliﬁcation avoids annoying diﬀerentiability issues. In what
follows, we omit tildes: ˜g and ˜ϕ are simply denoted by g and ϕ, respectively.

YOSHIHIKO MATSUMOTO

3.1. Preliminary considerations. We deﬁne Uρ := { 0 < ϕ < ρ } ⊂ Ω for small ρ > 0 so that
Mρ = { ϕ = ρ } is smooth. What we prove in this section is actually the following, which is
supposedly stronger than (2.6).

Proposition 3.1. Let n ≥ 3. For any positive number δ > 0,

(3.1)

L2

δH 0,1(Uρ; T 1,0) = 0

if ρ > 0 is suﬃciently small.

The claim (3.1), which is the solvability of the ∂-equation under the presence of boundary, is
a version of the ∂-Neumann problem. The proof reduces to establishing the estimate below (see
H¨ormander [27, Theorem 1.1.4] or [28, Theorem 4.1.1]).

Proposition 3.2. Let n ≥ 3 and δ > 0. For suﬃciently small ρ > 0, there exists a constant
C > 0 such that

(3.2)

kαk2 ≤ C(k∂αk2 + k∂∗αk2),

α ∈ dom ∂ ∩ dom ∂∗ ⊂ L2

δ∧0,1(Uρ; T 1,0).

As remarked in the previous section, we may incorporate the weight into the ﬁber metric of
T 1,0. Therefore we shall present the necessary computation for diﬀerential forms on Ω with values
in an arbitrary hermitian holomorphic vector bundle E.
In addition, we consider diﬀerential
(0, q)-forms in general, 0 ≤ q ≤ n, for it makes the situation clearer.

While the domain of ∂ = ∂0,q contains the space C∞

c ∧0,q(U ρ; E) of E-valued smooth (0, q)-
forms with compact support in U ρ = { 0 < ϕ ≤ ρ } as a subspace, the domain of ∂∗ does not
(unless q = 0, for which ∂∗ is trivial). We deﬁne

D0,q(U ρ; E) := C∞

c ∧0,q(U δ; E) ∩ dom ∂∗.

This space is described as follows. Let ξ be the (1, 0)-vector ﬁeld on U ρ such that, for each
0 < c ≤ ρ, its restriction ξ|Mc along the level set Mc = { ϕ = c } is the unit normal vector ﬁeld
pointing toward ∂Ω. Then α ∈ C∞

c ∧0,q(U ρ; E) belongs to D0,q(U ρ; E) if and only if

(3.3)

iξα = 0 on Mρ.

The following lemma shows that it suﬃces to establish the estimates for elements of D0,q(U ρ; E).

Lemma 3.3. The space D0,q(U ρ; E) is dense in dom ∂ ∩ dom ∂∗ ⊂ L2∧0,q(Uρ; E) with respect to
the graph norm α 7→ (kαk2 + k∂αk2 + k∂∗αk2)1/2.

Proof. By a partition of unity, we may decompose α ∈ dom ∂ ∩ dom ∂∗ into the sum α = α1 + α2,
where α1 is supported near Mρ and supp α2 ⊂ Uρ. It suﬃces to approximate α1 and α2 separately
by elements of D0,q(U ρ; E). Further partition allows us to assume that α1 is supported in a local
boundary chart U of U ρ. Then a result of H¨ormander [27, Proposition 1.2.4] (see also Chen–
Shaw [12, Lemma 4.3.2]) shows that there exists a sequence αν
1 ∈ D0,q(U ρ; E) supported in U
such that αν
1 → α1 in the graph norm. The second term α2 is approximated by smooth forms
supported in Uρ by the standard cut-oﬀ technique for complete manifolds (see, e.g., the proof
of [2, Lemma 4]).
(cid:3)

We will later need the divergence of ξ and the commutator [ξ, ξ], which can be computed as
follows. Recall from Lee–Melrose [31, Section 2] that there exists a unique (1, 0)-vector ﬁeld X
on a (two-sided) neighborhood of ∂Ω satisfying

ιX ∂∂ϕ = κ∂ϕ,

∂ϕ(X) = −1

DEFORMATION OF EINSTEIN METRICS AND L2 COHOMOLOGY

13

for some real-valued function κ, which is called the transverse curvature. Then, since

g =

∂ϕ ∂ϕ
ϕ2 −

∂∂ϕ

ϕ

,

we get |X|2 = ϕ−2(1 + κϕ) and hence ξ = (1 + κϕ)−1/2ϕX, which is the metric dual of (1 +
κϕ)1/2∂(− log ϕ). This implies that

(3.4)

div ξ = tr ∇′ξ = trg ∂((1 + κϕ)1/2∂(− log ϕ))

= trg ∂∂(− log ϕ) + o(1) = n + o(1)

as ϕ → 0,

where ∇ = ∇′ + ∇′′ is the type decomposition of the Levi-Civita connection. Moreover,

(3.5)

[ξ, ξ] = [ϕX, ϕX] + o(1) = ϕX − ϕX + ϕ2[X, X] + o(1) = ξ − ξ + o(1)

as ϕ → 0,

the last equality being because [X, X] is continuous up to ∂Ω and hence has O(ϕ−1) pointwise
norm with respect to g.

3.2. The estimate. The usual technique for the ∂-Neumann problem on strictly pseudoconvex
domains is to use the Morrey–Kohn–H¨ormander equality, which equates k∂αk2
L2 with
k∇′′αk2
L2 plus zeroth-order terms and a boundary integral. However, in our case, Mρ is strictly
pseudoconcave as the boundary of Uρ. H¨ormander [27] introduced (see also Folland–Kohn [21,
Section III.2]) the “condition Z(q)” to take such cases into consideration. An interpretation
of his technique is to use an equality that lies between those of Morrey–Kohn–H¨ormander and
Bochner–Kodaira–Nakano, the latter being, in this case, a relation between k∂αk2
L2 + k∂∗αk2
L2
and k∇′αk2
L2. We shall apply his approach and write the relevant terms in terms of curvature.
We start with a geometric version of the Morrey–Kohn–H¨ormander equality established by
Andreotti–Vesentini [2]. Let α, β ∈ D0,q(U ρ; E). Using local holomorphic coordinates (z1, . . . , zn)
and a local holomorphic frame (s1, . . . , srank E) of E, we write

L2 + k∂∗αk2

α = α

j 1···jq dzj1 ∧ · · · ∧ dzjq ⊗ sa.

a

The sum is taken over all (j1, . . . , jq) ∈ { 1, . . . , n }q (not only over the increasing indices); the
index a runs through { 1, . . . , rank E }. Then we deﬁne

hα, βi :=

1
q!

j 1···jq βj1···jq
α

a

a

and (α, β) :=ZUρ

hα, βi dVg.

The latter can be explicitly written as (α, β)L2(Uρ), but we suppress L2(Uρ) for notational sim-
plicity. The L2-norm of α on Uρ is deﬁned by kαk = (α, α)1/2. Moreover, we write |α|2 = hα, αi
and

kαk2

b :=ZMρ

|α|2dSg,

where dSg is the area measure on Mρ induced by dVg. The actions of the Ricci tensor of g and
the curvature S = S b
ija of E are deﬁned as follows, where the square bracket notation means
that we take the skew-symmetrization over the indices j1, j2, ..., jq:

Then, using (3.3), we get (see [2, p. 113])

|∂ log ϕ|

|α|2.

The asymptotic curvature behavior (1.2) implies

Ric◦ α = −q(n + 1)α + o(1).

Moreover, |∂ log ϕ| = (1 + κϕ)1/2 and thus it tends to 1 uniformly at ∂Ω. Therefore,

(3.6)

k∂αk2 + k∂∗αk2 = k∇′′αk2 − q(n + 1)kαk2 + (˚Sα, α) − qkαk2

where the remainder term being o(kαk2 + kαk2
small then the absolute value of this term is bounded by ε(kαk2 + kαk2

b) means that, for any ε > 0, if ρ > 0 is suﬃciently

b).

Andreotti–Vesentini equality (3.6) has two defects for our purpose: the presence of a negative
b and the fact that the curvature term becomes negative. Both can be

boundary integral −qkαk2
remedied by decomposing k∇′′αk2 into the tangential and normal parts,

k∇′′αk2 = k∇′′

b αk2 + k∇ξαk2,

and replacing k∇′′

b αk2 with k∇′

bαk2 by integration-by-parts.

Lemma 3.4. For α ∈ C∞

c ∧0,q(U ρ; E),

b αk2 = k∇′

bαk2 + n(n + q − 1)kαk2 − kιξαk2 − ((trg S)α, α) + (S(ξ, ξ)α, α)
+ 2(n − 1) Re(∇ξα, α) + (n − 1)kαk2

b + o(kαk2 + k∇bαk2 + k∇ξαk2 + kαk2

b).

Proof. We ﬁrst compute the diﬀerence between k∇′′αk2 and k∇′αk2. By the divergence theorem,

k∇′′αk2 = −(trg ∇′∇′′α, α) −ZMρ

h∇ξα, αi ,

where the trace of ∇′∇′′α ∈ Ω1,0 ⊗ Ω0,1 ⊗ Ω0,q is taken in the ﬁrst Ω1,0 ⊗ Ω0,1 factors. The trace
can be rewritten as

trg ∇′∇′′α = trg ∇′′∇′α + Ric◦ α + (trg S)α.

Hence

(3.7)

k∇′′αk2 = −(trg ∇′′∇′α, α) − (Ric◦ α, α) − ((trg S)α, α) −ZMρ

h∇ξα, αi

= k∇′αk2 − (Ric◦ α, α) − ((trg S)α, α) +ZMρ
= k∇′αk2 + q(n + 1)kαk2 − ((trg S)α, α) +ZMρ

h∇ξ−ξα, αi

h∇ξ−ξα, αi + o(kαk2).

Next we compute the diﬀerence between k∇ξαk2 and k∇ξαk2. Again by the divergence theorem,

k∇ξαk2 = −(∇ξ∇ξα, α) − ((div ξ)∇ξα, α) −ZMρ

h∇ξα, αi

= −(∇ξ∇ξα + R(ξ, ξ)α + S(ξ, ξ)α + ∇[ξ,ξ]α, α) − ((div ξ)∇ξα, α) −ZMρ

h∇ξα, αi .

Since R(ξ, ξ)α = −qα − qξ♭ ∧ ιξα + o(|α|) by (1.2), where ξ♭ is the metric dual of ξ, we get

(R(ξ, ξ)α, α) = −qkαk2 − kιξαk2 + o(kαk2).

DEFORMATION OF EINSTEIN METRICS AND L2 COHOMOLOGY

15

Moreover,

k∇ξαk2 = −(∇ξ∇ξα, α) − ((div ξ)∇ξα, α) −ZMρ

As a result, we can conclude that

h∇ξα, αi .

k∇ξαk2 = k∇ξαk2 + qkαk2 + kιξαk2 − (S(ξ, ξ)α, α) − (∇[ξ,ξ]α, α)

− ((div ξ)∇ξα, α) + ((div ξ)∇ξα, α) +ZMρ

h∇ξ−ξα, αi + o(kαk2).

By (3.4) and (3.5),

((div ξ)∇ξα, α) − ((div ξ)∇ξα, α) − (∇[ξ,ξ]α, α)
= (n − 1)(∇ξ−ξα, α) + (∇f ξ−f ξα, α) + o(kαk2 + k∇bαk2),

where f is a smooth function deﬁned near ∂Ω that vanishes along ∂Ω. Summarizing, we have

k∇ξαk2 = k∇ξαk2 + qkαk2 + kιξαk2 − (S(ξ, ξ)α, α) + (n − 1)(∇ξ−ξα, α)

+ (∇f ξ−f ξα, α) +ZMρ

h∇ξ−ξα, αi + o(kαk2 + k∇bαk2).

Now

(∇ξα, α) =ZUρ

ξ|α|2 − (∇ξα, α) = −ZUρ

(div ξ)|α|2 − kαk2

b − (∇ξα, α)

= −nkαk2 − kαk2

b − (∇ξα, α) + o(kαk2)

and similarly one gets (∇f ξα, α) = o(kαk2 + k∇ξαk2 + kαk2

b). Therefore,

k∇ξαk2 = k∇ξαk2 + qkαk2 + kιξαk2 − (S(ξ, ξ)α, α) − n(n − 1)kαk2 − 2(n − 1) Re(∇ξα, α)

− (n − 1)kαk2

b +ZMρ

h∇ξ−ξα, αi + o(kαk2 + k∇bαk2 + k∇ξαk2 + kαk2

b).

Combining this with (3.7), we obtain the lemma.

(cid:3)

Equation (3.6) and Lemma 3.4 imply the following approximate equality for α ∈ D0,q(U ρ; E):

(3.8) k∂αk2 + k∂∗αk2 = k∇′

bαk2 + k∇ξαk2 + (n2 − n − q)kαk2 − kιξαk2

b

+ o(kαk2 + k∇′

bαk2 + k∇ξαk2 + kαk2

b).

As a consequence, we obtain the following estimate.

Proposition 3.5. For α ∈ D0,q(U ρ; E)

(3.9) k∂αk2 + k∂∗αk2 ≥ (˚Sα − (trg S)α + S(ξ, ξ)α, α) + (n − q − 2)kαk2 + (n − q − 1)kαk2
b
+ o(kαk2 + kαk2
b)

in the sense that, for any given ε > 0, if ρ > 0 is suﬃciently small then inequality (3.9) with
o(kαk2 + kαk2

b) holds for any α ∈ D0,q(U ρ; E).

b) replaced by −ε(kαk2 + kαk2

We apply this proposition to E = Eδ = (T 1,0, ϕ−δg). Then, since

S = R − δ∂∂(− log ϕ) ⊗ I = R − δg ⊗ I,

we get

(˚Sα, α) ≥ −(2q + qδ)kαk2 + o(kαk2),

((trg S)α, α) = −(n + 1 + nδ)kαk2 + o(kαk2),
(S(ξ, ξ)α, α) ≥ −(2 + δ)kαk2 + o(kαk2).

Therefore, for any ε > 0, if ρ > 0 is small enough then

(3.11)

k∂αk2 + k∂∗αk2 ≥ (2n − 3q − 3 − ε)kαk2 + (n − q − 1)δkαk2 + (n − q − 1 − ε)kαk2
b

for any α ∈ D0,q(U ρ; E). Thus Proposition 3.2 follows by Lemma 3.3, and the proof of our main
theorem is completed. It is also obvious from (3.11) that, if n ≥ 4, then we actually do not need
the weight ϕ−δ.

Appendix A. On the vanishing result of Donnelly and Fefferman

Recall the following theorem on the space L2Hp,q(Ω) of L2 harmonic (p, q)-forms due to

Donnelly and Feﬀerman (which is restated in a way that is convenient for us).

Theorem A.1 (Donnelly–Feﬀerman [16], Donnelly [15]). Let Ω be a smoothly bounded strictly
pseudoconvex domain of a Stein manifold Y equipped with the Cheng–Yau metric. Then,

(A.1)

dim L2Hp,q(Ω) =(0,

∞,

p + q 6= n,

p + q = n.

Actually, Donnelly–Feﬀerman [16] considered the case in which Y = Cn, and the metric
was the Bergman metric (which is in fact quasi-equivalent to the Cheng–Yau metric). For this
case, Berndtsson [3] has given another proof for (p, q) = (n, 1) in connection with the extension
theorem of Ohsawa–Takegoshi. The result of Donnelly [15] is more far-reaching:
it applies to
any complex manifold Ω equipped with a complete K¨ahler metric g whose associated 2-form ω
admits the expression ω = dη with a 1-form η bounded with respect to g. It is based on an
observation of Gromov [26].

We shall see in this appendix that our technique can also be used to give another proof of the
vanishing part of Theorem A.1. As we did in Section 3, instead of the Cheng–Yau metric, we
can consider a metric g of the form

gij = ∂i∂j(− log ϕ),

where ϕ is some smooth deﬁning function of Ω. We apply the theory of geometric elliptic
diﬀerential operators outlined in Subsection 1.3 to the Dolbeault Laplacian ∆∂.

By the Poincar´e duality, it suﬃces to show L2Hp,q(Ω) = 0 for p + q < n. For these cases, on

the complex hyperbolic space CH n, the coercivity estimate

kαk2 ≤ Ck∆∂αk2,

α ∈ dom ∆∂ ⊂ L2∧p,q(Ω)

follows by the argument in [16, Section 3] based on a formula of Donnelly–Xavier [17]. This
makes Proposition 1.4 applicable. Our claim is the following.

Lemma A.2. If p + q < n, then the indicial radius R∆∂ of the Dolbeault Laplacian ∆∂ acting
on (p, q)-forms is positive. Therefore, by Proposition 1.4, the space L2Hp,q(Ω) is contained in
L2

δHp,q(Ω) for some δ > 0.

DEFORMATION OF EINSTEIN METRICS AND L2 COHOMOLOGY

This lemma reduces the vanishing of L2Hp,q(Ω) to that of the weighted cohomology

(A.2)

L2

δH p,q(Ω) = 0

by the same argument as in the last paragraph of Subsection 2.2. The point is that (A.2) can
be shown by the Bochner–Kodaira–Nakano equality in the usual way. Let Lδ be the trivial line
bundle equipped with the ﬁber metric ϕ−δ. Then the curvature S of Lδ is given by

Sij = −δ∂i∂j (− log ϕ) = −δgij .

Therefore, for compactly supported smooth (p, q)-form α ∈ C∞
one has

c ∧p,q(Ω; Lδ) with values in Lδ,

k∂αk2 + k∂∗αk2 = kD′αk2 + k(D′)∗αk2 + (n − p − q)δkαk2,

where D′ is the holomorphic part of the covariant exterior derivative. Since C∞
dense in dom ∂ ∩ dom ∂∗, this implies (A.2).

c ∧p,q(Ω; Lδ) is

The computation of R∆∂ is tedious but straightforward, no matter which of the methods of [5]

and [32] is used. The bundle of (p, q)-forms is associated to the representationVp
Vp(Cn−1)∗ ⊗0Vq(Cn−1)∗, where ⊗0 means that we take the totally trace-free part, the indicial

roots p + q and 2n − p − q appear. These are the closest roots to the line Re s = n, which means
that R∆∂ = n − p − q. The veriﬁcation is left to the interested reader.
