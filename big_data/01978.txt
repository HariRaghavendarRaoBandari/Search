rive interior estimates of solutions under the assumption of the uniform K-
stability.

Interior estimates, generalized Abreu Equation.

1. Introduction

The existence of extremal and contant scalar curvature is a central prob-
lem in K¨ahler geometry. In a series of papers [10], [11], [12], and [13], Don-
aldson studied this problem on toric manifolds and proved the existence of
metrics of constant scaler curvatures on toric surfaces under an appropriate
stability condition. Later on in [6] and [7], Chen, Li and Sheng proved the
existence of metrics of prescribed scaler curvatures on toric surfaces under
the uniform stability condition.

It is important to generalize the results of Chen, Li and Sheng to more
general K¨ahler manifold. This is one of a sequence of papers, aiming at
generalizing the results of Chen, Li and Sheng to homogeneous toric bundles.

(1.1)

Here, D > 0 and A are two given smooth functions on ¯∆ and (uij) is the
inverse of the Hessian matrix (uij). The equation (1.1) was introduced by
Donaldson [14] in the study of the scalar curvature of toric ﬁbration, see also
[23] and [21]. In [20] the authors also derived this PDE in the study of the
scalar curvature of homogeneous toric bundles. We call (1.1) a generalized
Abreu Equation. The main result is the following interior estimate
Theorem 1.1. Let ∆ be a bounded open polytope in Rn and D > 0, A be
two smooth functions on ¯∆. Suppose (∆, D, A) is uniformly K-stable and
u is a solution in Spo of the equation (1.1). Then, for any Ω ⊂⊂ ∆, any
nonnegative integer k and any constant α ∈ (0, 1),

(cid:107)u(cid:107)Ck+3,α(Ω) ≤ C,

where C is a positive constant depending only on n, k, α, Ω, D, (cid:107)A(cid:107)Ck( ¯∆)
and λ in the uniform K-stability.

A equivalent statement of Theorem 1.1 is the following

Theorem 1.2. Suppose that (∆, D, A) is uniformly K-stable and that {A(k)}
is a sequence of smooth functions in ¯∆ such that A(k) converges to A smoothly
in ¯∆. Assume u(k) ∈ Spo is a sequence of solutions of the generalized Abreu
Equation

= −A(k)D in ∆.

Then there is a subsequence, still denoted by u(k), such that u(k) converges
smoothly, in any compact set Ω ⊂ ∆, to some smooth and strictly convex
function u in ∆.

The main ideal of the proof is following:
Note that, as Donaldson pointed out that, the uniform stability of (∆, D, A)
implies that there is a subsequence, still denoted by u(k), locally uniformly

converging to u in ∆. The key point is to prove that u is smooth and strictly
convex. We consider the Legendre transform f (k) of u(k). Then f (k) satisfy

(1.3)

(cid:88)

In Section 3, we derive an uniform lower bound and an uniform upper bound
of the determinants of the Hessian of f (k). We can not directly apply the
Caﬀarelli and Guti´errez theory to the PDE (1.3). We prove a convergence
theorem for this PDE in Section 4. Then Theorem 1.2 follows.

2. Uniform stability

Let ∆ be a Delzant polytope in Rn, ck be a constant and hk be an aﬃne
linear function in Rn, k = 1,··· , d. Suppose that ∆ is deﬁned by linear
inequalities hk(ξ) − ck > 0, for k = 1,··· , d, where each hk(ξ) − ck = 0
deﬁnes a facet of ∆. Write δk(ξ) = hk(ξ) − ck and set

v(ξ) =

δk(ξ) log δk(ξ).

(2.1)

k

This function was ﬁrst introduced by Guillemin [16].
It deﬁnes a K¨ahler
metric on the toric variety deﬁned by ∆. We introduce several classes of
functions. Set

C = {u ∈ C( ¯∆) : u is convex on ¯∆ and smooth on ∆},
S = {u ∈ C( ¯∆) : u is convex on ¯∆ and u − v is smooth on ¯∆},

where v is given in (2.1). For a ﬁxed point po ∈ ∆, we consider

Cpo = {u ∈ C : u ≥ u(po) = 0},
Spo = {u ∈ S : u ≥ u(po) = 0}.

We say functions in Cpo and Spo are normalized at po. Let
C∗ = {u|there exist a constant C > 0 and a sequence of {u(k)} in Cpo

∂∆ u(k)Ddσ < C and u(k) locally uniformly converges to

such that(cid:82)

u in ∆}.

For any u ∈ C∗, deﬁne u on boundary as

Let P > 0 be a constant, we deﬁne
CP∗ = {u ∈ C∗|

u(q) = lim

uDdσ ≤ P}.

Following [21] we consider the functional

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

FA(u) = −

log det(uij)Ddµ + LA(u),

(2.2)

(cid:90)

where

LA(u) =

uDdσ −

AuDdµ.

∆

∂∆

(2.3)
FA is called the Mabuchi functional and LA is closely related to the Futaki
invariants. The Euler-Lagrangian equation for FA is (1.1). It is known that,
if u ∈ S satisﬁes the equation (1.1), then u is an absolute minimizer for FA
on S.
Deﬁnition 2.1. Let D > 0 and A be two smooth functions on ¯∆. Then,
(∆, D, A) is called uniformly K-stable if the functional LA vanishes on aﬃne-
linear functions and there exists a constant λ > 0 such that, for any u ∈ Cpo,

LA(u) ≥ λ

uDdσ.

(2.4)

We also say that ∆ is (D, A, λ)-stable.

∂∆

Remark 2.2. The conditions in Deﬁnition 2.1 are exactly the contents of
Condition 1 [21]. Following Donaldson we call it the uniform K-stability.

Using the same method in [9] we immediately get

Theorem 2.3. If the equation (1.1) has a solution in S, then (∆, D, A) is
uniform K-stable.

Namely, the uniform K-stability is a necessary condition for existing a

solution of (1.1) in S. We pose the

4

Question 2.4. Let ∆ ⊂ Rn be a Delzant polytope, D > 0 and A be two
smooth functions on ¯∆. Does the uniform K-stability of (∆, D, A) imply that
the equation (1.1) has a solution in S?

Assume that v ∈ Spo is the solution of the equation (1.1), and u is a
convex function. For any segment I ⊂⊂ ∆, u deﬁnes a convex function
w := u|I on I. It deﬁnes a Monge-Ampere measure on I, we denote this by
N . The key point of the proof in [9] is the following lemma.
Lemma 2.5. Let u ∈ CP∗ and u(k) ∈ C locally uniformly converges to u. If
N (I) = m > 0, then

LA(u(k)) > τ m
for some positive constant τ independent of k.

In our present case this lemma still holds due to C−1 ≤ D ≤ C for some

constant C > 0. For reader’s convenience we give the proofs here.

Proof of Lemma 2.5. Let p be the midpoint of I. We choose coordinate
system {0, ξ} such that p is the origin, I is on the ξ1 axis and I = (−a, a).
Set I = [−a + , a − ]. By choosing  small we can assume that

N (I) ≥ 3m
4

.

(2.5)

Suppose that there is a Euclidean ball B := Bo(0) in ξ1 = 0 plane such that
I × B ⊂⊂ ∆. Suppose that u is a limit of a sequence u(k) ∈ C. Then u(k)
converges to u uniformly on I × B. We have

LA(u(k)) =

viju(k)
ij

Ddµ.

(2.6)

(cid:90)

Consider the functions

∆

w(k)

ξ (ξ1) = u(k)(ξ1, ξ),

ξ1 ∈ I, ξ ∈ B.

We denote by N (k)
. We
claim that there exists a small B and large K such that for any ξ ∈ B, k > K

the Monge-Ampere measure on I induced by w(k)

ξ

(I) ≥ m/2.

N (k)

(2.7)

In fact, if not, then there exists a subsequence of k, still denote by k, and a
sequence of ξk ∈ B with ξk → 0 such that N (k)
(I) < m/2. However, by the
weakly convergence of Monge-Ampere measure, we have

ξk

N (I) ≤ lim

k→∞ N (k)

ξk

(I) ≤ m/2,

this contradicts (2.5).

On the other hand, the eigenvalues of vij are bounded below in I × B, let

δ be the lower bound. Then

This completes the proof of Lemma 2.5.

Then by the same method as in [9] we can prove Theorem 2.3.

3.1. The lower bound of the determinant

The following Lemma is proved in [21] for toricﬁbration. It can be extend

directly to the generalized Abreu Equation (1.1).

6

Lemma 3.1. Let ∆ be a bounded open polytope in Rn and D > 0, A be two
smooth functions on ¯∆. Let u ∈ C be a strictly convex function satisfying the
generalized Abreu Equation (1.1). Suppose that F = 0 on ∂∆. Then

det(uij) ≥ C1(sup∆A)−n

everywhere in ∆, where C1 is a constant depending on n, D and ∆.

In the following we derive a more stronger estimate than Lemma 3.1,
which will be used in our next papers. First we prove a preliminary lemma.
Lemma 3.2. Let ∆ be a bounded open polytope. Suppose that F = 0 on ∂∆.
Let E be an edge of ∆. Suppose that E is given by ξ1 = 0. Set

Now we prove

Lemma 3.3. Let ∆ be a bounded open polytope in Rn and D > 0, A be two
smooth functions on ¯∆. Let u ∈ C be a strictly convex function satisfying
the generalized Abreu Equation (1.1). Suppose that F = 0 on ∂∆. Let E be
an edge of ∆. Suppose that E is given by ξ1 = 0. Let p ∈ Eo. Then the
following estimate holds in a neighborhood of p

det(uij) ≥ b
ξ1

for some constant b > 0 depending only on n, diam(∆), max ¯∆
and (cid:107)A(cid:107)L∞(∆).
Proof. First we prove that there exists a constant b0 > 0 such that

Choose β = 1
(3.5) holds. We discuss two cases.

Obviously, h < 0 on ∂∆. We have

(cid:88)

U ijhij = −AD + b1 det(uij)

uijvij

≥ −AD + nb1 det(uij)1−1/2(det(vij))1/2
≥ −AD + nb1d1C(0).

Here we use the estimate det(D2u) ≥ d1. By choosing the constant b1 large,

we have(cid:80) U ijhij ≥ 0. So h attains its maximum on ∂∆. Then w ≤ b1D−1|v|.

It follows that

Case 2. n ≥ 3. Choose a sequence {αk} such that

Obviously,

and there is k(cid:63) ∈ Z+ such that αk(cid:63) < 1 − 1
We ﬁrst let α = α1, h = F + b2v. By the same argument as in Case 1 we get

constant C5 > 0 independent of p.

3.2. The upper bound of the determinant

Let u ∈ Spo be a solution of the generalized Abreu Equation (1.1). In this
section, we derive a global upper bound of the determinant of the Hessian of
u. The proof of the following lemma is standard

10

Lemma 3.4. Suppose that u ∈ Spo satisﬁes the generalized Abreu Equation
(1.1). Assume that the section

¯Su(po, C) = {ξ ∈ ∆ : u(ξ) ≤ C}

is compact and that there is a constant b > 0 such that

(cid:18) ∂u

n(cid:88)

∂ξk

k=1

(cid:19)2 ≤ b

on ¯Su(po, C).

Then,

det(uij) ≤ C2

in Su(po, C/2),

where C2 is a positive constant depending on n, C and b.

Following [8] we derive a global estimate for the upper bound of det(uij)
for the generalized Abreu Equation (1.1). This upper bound relates to the
Legendre transforms of solutions.
For any point p on ∂∆, there is an aﬃne coordinate {ξ1, ..., ξn}, such that,
for some 1 ≤ m ≤ n, a neighborhood U ⊂ ¯∆ of p is deﬁned by m inequalities

ξ1 ≥ 0,

...,

ξm ≥ 0,

with ξ(p) = 0. Then, v in (2.1) has the form

m(cid:88)

i=1

v =

ξi log ξi + α(ξ),

where α is a smooth function in ¯U . By Proposition 2 in [11], we have the
following result.

Lemma 3.5. There holds

det(vij) =(cid:2)ξ1ξ2...ξmβ(ξ)(cid:3)−1

in ∆,

where β(ξ) is smooth up to the boundary and β(0) = 1.

For any q ∈ ∆ denote by dE(q, ∂∆) the Euclidean distance from q to ∂∆.

By Lemma 3.5, we have

det(vij) ≤

C

[dE(p, ∂∆)]n

in ∆,

(3.11)

11

where C is a positive constant.

Recall that po ∈ ∆ is the point we ﬁxed for Spo. Now we choose coordi-

nates ξ1, ..., ξn such that ξ(po) = 0. Set

xi =

∂u
∂ξi

,

f =

(cid:88)

i

xiξi − u.

Lemma 3.6. Let ∆ be a bounded open polytope in Rn and D > 0, A be
smooth functions on ¯∆. Let u ∈ Spo be a strictly convex function satisfying
the generalized Abreu Equation (1.1). Assume, for some positive constants d
and b,

1 +(cid:80) x2
(d + f )2 ≤ b

i

in Rn.

Then,

exp{−C3f} det(uij)

(d + f )2n ≤ C4

in ∆,

where C3 is a positive constant depending only on n and ∆, and C4 is a
positive constant depending only on n, d, b, D and max ¯∆ |A|.
Proof. Let v be given as in (2.1). By adding a linear function, we assume that
v is also normalized at po. Denote g = L(v). By (3.11), it is straightforward
to check that there exists a positive constant C1 such that

det(vij)e−C1g → 0 as p → ∂∆.

Since u = v + φ for some φ ∈ C∞( ¯∆), then

det(uij)e−C1f → 0 as p → ∂∆.

Lemma 4.1. Let Ω∗ ⊂ Rn be a normalized domain, u ∈ F(Ω∗, C) be a
function satisfying the generalized Abreu Equation (1.1). Suppose that there
is a constant C1 > 0 such that in Ω∗

1 ≤ det(uij) ≤ C1.

Then for any Ω◦ ⊂⊂ Ω∗, p > 2, we have the estimate

(cid:107)u(cid:107)C3,α(Ω◦) ≤ C,
where C depends on n, p, D, C1,(cid:107)A(cid:107)L∞(∆), dist(Ω◦, ∂Ω∗).

(cid:107)u(cid:107)W 4,p(Ω◦) ≤ C,

(4.2)

Proof. In [3] Caﬀarelli-Gutierrez proved a H¨older estimate of det(uij) for
homogeneous linearized Monge-Amp`ere equations assuming that the Monge-
Amp`ere measure µ[u] satisﬁes some condition, which is guaranteed by (4.1).
Consider the generalized Abreu Equation

(cid:88)

U ijFij = −AD, F :=

D

det(uij)

where A ∈ L∞(Ω). Since D ∈ C∞( ¯∆) and D > 0, by the same argument in
[3] one can obtain the H¨older continuity of det(uij). Then Caﬀarelli’s C 2,α
estimates for Monge-Amp`ere equations [2] give us

(cid:107)u(cid:107)C2,α(Ω∗) ≤ C2.

Following from the standard elliptic regularity theory we have (cid:107)u(cid:107)W 4,p(Ω∗) ≤
C3. By the Sobolev embedding theorem

(cid:107)u(cid:107)C3,α(Ω◦) ≤ C4(cid:107)u(cid:107)W 4,p(Ω∗).

Then the lemma follows. (cid:4)

Proof.
It is obvious that there exists a subsequence of functions, locally
uniformly converging to a function f∞ in Ω. A fundamental result on Monge-
Amp`ere equation tell us that f∞ is C 1,α and strictly convex (see [17]). Sup-
pose that f∞(p) = 0 for some point p ∈ Ω. We choose the coordinates
x = (x1, ..., xn) such that x(p) = 0. Put

We have f∞(0) = u∞(0) = 0. The key point of the proof of the Theorem is

Claim. There are constants C > 0, b > r > 0 such that ¯Su∞(0, C) is
compact and

Dr(0) ⊂ Su∞(0, C) ⊂ Db(0).

Proof of Claim. Denote

M := {(x, f∞(x))|x ∈ Ω}, M∗ := {(ξ, u∞(ξ))|ξ ∈ Ω∗

16

Then M is a C 1,α strictly convex hypersurface with the support hyperplane
H = {x|xn+1 = 0} at 0. We look at the geometry meaning of u∞. Let q ∈ Ω
be a point near 0. The support hyperplane of M at (q, f∞(q)) is given by

(cid:26)
(x1, ..., xn, xn+1)|(cid:88)

(2) dist(cid:0) ¯Sf∞(0, b2), ∂ ¯Sf∞(0, b1)(cid:1) ≥ d2.

By strictly convexity of f∞ we can ﬁnd b1 > b2 > 0, d1 > d2 > 0 such that
(1) ¯Sf∞(0, b2) ⊂ ¯Sf∞(0, b1) ⊂ Dd1(0) ⊂ Ω,

i = 1.

Then

|∇f∞| ≤ b1
d1

∀x ∈ ¯Sf∞(0, b2).

It follows that ¯Su∞(0, C) ⊂ Db(0) for some constant b > 0. By compactness
we can ﬁnd p ∈ ∂Sf∞(0, b2) such that u∞(p) = min∂Sf∞ (0,b2){u∞}. By ((cid:63)) we
can ﬁnd a set Ω◦ ⊂ ¯Sf∞(0, b2)} such that

u∞(x) = u∞(p) ∀x ∈ ∂Ω◦.

17

Let q ∈ ∂Ω◦ be the point with f∞(q) = min∂Ω◦{f∞}. By the strictly convex-
ity of f∞, we have f∞(q) > 0. Consider the convex cone V with vertex (0, 0)
and the base

{(x1, x2, ..., xn, f∞(q))|x2

1 + ... + x2

1}.
n = d2

By the comparison theorem of normal maps, there exists a Euclidean ball
Dr(0) such that Dr(0) ⊂ ∇f∞( ¯Sf∞(0, f∞(q)). We choose C = u∞(p). Then

Dr(0) ⊂ Su∞(0, C) ⊂ Db(0).

The claim follows.

By the claim we conclude that

A direct calculation shows that u(k) satisfy the generalized Abreu Equation
(1.1). By Lemma 4.1 u(k) C m+3-converges to u∞. It follows that f(k) C m+3-
converges to f∞ in a neighborhood of 0.

Now let p ∈ Ω be an arbitrary point, let l be the linear function deﬁning

the support hyperplane of M at (p, f∞(p)). Let

˜f∞ = f∞ − l.

We use ˜f∞ instead f and use the same argument above. The theorem follows.
(cid:4)

5. Proof of the Main Theorem

Since (∆, D, A) is uniformly K-stable and A(k) converges to A smoothly in
¯∆, then (∆, D, A(k)) is uniformly K-stable for large k, i.e., ∆ is (A(k), D, λ)-
stable for some constant λ > 0 independent of k. Since u(k) satisﬁes the
generalized Abreu Equation (1.1), then

It follows that u(k) locally and uniformly converges to a convex function u in
∆.

Claim. For any point ξ ∈ ∆ and any Bδ(ξ) ⊂ ∆, there exists a point
ξo ∈ Bδ(ξ) such that u has second derivatives and is strictly convex at ξo.
Here, Bδ(ξ) denotes the Euclidean ball centered at ξ with radius δ.

The proof of the claim is the same as in [4], see also [8].

We now choose coordinates such that ξo = 0. By adding linear functions,
we assume that all u(k) and u are normalized at 0. Since u is strictly convex
at 0, there exist constants (cid:48) > 0, d2 > d1 > 0 and b(cid:48) > 0, independent of k,
such that, for large k,

and

where C1 < C2 are positive constants independent of k. By Lemma 4.1
{u(k)} converges smoothly to u. Therefore, u is a smooth and strictly convex
function in Su(0, (cid:48)/2).

Let f (k) be the Legendre transform of u(k). Then, {f (k)} locally uniformly
converges to a convex function f deﬁned in the whole Rn. Furthermore, in
a neighborhood of 0, f is a smooth and strictly convex function such that
its Legrendre transform u satisﬁes the generalized Abreu Equation (1.1). By
the convexity of f (k) and the local and uniform convergence of {f (k)} to f ,
we conclude, for any k,

Lemma 3.6, we have

(d + C)2n ≤ det(f (k)

ij ) ≤ C1.

We note that each f (k) satisﬁes (4.3). By Theorem 4.2 we conclude that
{f (k)} uniformly and smoothly converges to f in Sf (0, C/2). Since C is
arbitrary, f is a smooth and strictly convex function in Rn, and the sequence
{f (k)} locally and smoothly converges to f . By Legendre transforms, we
obtain that u is a smooth and strictly convex function in ∆ and that the
sequence {u(k)} locally and smoothly converges to u. This completes the
proof of Theorem 1.2.
