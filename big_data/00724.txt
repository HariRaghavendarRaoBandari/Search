Abstract

This is a report on our newly proposed model of dynamical supersymmetry breaking with some

details of the analysis involved. The model in the simplest version has only a chiral superﬁeld

(multiplet), with a strong four-superﬁeld interaction in the K¨ahler potential that induces a real

two-superﬁeld composite with vacuum condensate. The latter has supersymmetry breaking parts,

which we show to bear nontrivial solution following basically a standard nonperturbative analysis

for a Nambu–Jona-Lasinio type model on a superﬁeld setting. The real composite superﬁeld

has a spin one component but is otherwise quite unconventional. We discuss also the parallel

analysis for the eﬀective theory with the composite. Plausible vacuum solutions are illustrated

and analyzed. The supersymmetry breaking solutions have generated soft mass(es) for the scalar

avoiding the vanishing supertrace condition for the squared-masses of the superﬁeld components.

We also present some analysis of the resulted low energy eﬀective theory with components of

the composite become dynamical. The determinant of the fermionic modes is shown to be zero

illustrating the presence of the expected Goldstino. The model gives the possibility of constructing a

supersymmetric standard model with all (super)symmetry breaking masses generated dynamically

and directly without the necessity of complicated hidden or mediating sectors.

INTRODUCTION

With the discovery of the Higgs particle at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the full

success of the Standard Model (SM) has been crowned. Unfortunately, we still do not

see any clear indications of experimental features beyond so long as phenomenology at the

TeV scale is concerned. Theorists are however mostly unsatisﬁed with the SM, particularly

with its Higgs sector and explanation of the origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking.

With a negative mass-square at the right scale put in by hand, the Higgs mechanism looks

like only a phenomenological description of the ‘true’ theory behind. Moreover, the other

parts of the SM theory have their ﬁeld content tightly constrained by the gauge symmetry

and no parameters with mass dimensions admissible; everything in the Higgs sector looks

completely arbitrary in comparison. Another way of looking at the issue would be that the

only natural value of any input mass parameter should be like the model cutoﬀ scale. We

need a model with a dynamical mechanism to generate the extra mass scale substantially

below the cutoﬀ.

Practical and experimentally accessible physics is really only about eﬀective (ﬁeld) theo-

ries. Taking the SM as an eﬀective ﬁeld theory, one would admit the higher dimensional op-

erators with couplings suppressed by powers of the model cutoﬀ scale in the Lagrangian. Ac-

tually, a dimension six term of four-fermion(/four-quark) interaction with otherwise strong

coupling gives interesting nonperturbative dynamics that can break symmetries and gener-

ate masses [1]. That is the Nobel prize-winning classic Nambu–Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model

[2], to which Higgs physics may correspond to the low energy eﬀective theory with the Higgs

doublet being identiﬁed as a two-fermion composite. This beautiful idea of the top-mode

SM [3–8] fails to accommodate the too small phenomenological top quark mass [1]. At this

point, it looks like a holomorphic supersymmetric version that gives the (minimal) supersym-

metric standard model (SSM) with both Higgs supermultiplets as two-superﬁeld composite

maintains phenomenological viability [9].

The SSM is still the most popular candidate theory beyond the SM being matched to

the LHC results. The theoretical beauty of supersymmetry is certain part of its appeal.

The ﬁrst supersymmetric Nambu–Jona-Lasinio (SNJL) model was introduced in the early

eighties [10, 11], generalizing the four-fermion interaction to a four-superﬁeld interaction

of the same dimension in the K¨ahler potential . Recently, our group introduced the holo-

3

morphic version (HSNJL) as an alternative supersymmetrization [12] with a four-superﬁeld

interaction in the superpotential [9]. The two versions have diﬀerent theoretical and phe-

nomenological merits [9, 13, 14]. However, both versions require input soft supersymmetry

breaking masses to have the dynamical (electroweak) symmetry breaking. On the other

hand, the phenomenological SSM requires soft supersymmetry breaking masses/parameters

the origin of which is typically depicted through elaborated constructions of complicated

and contrived models with extra supersymmetry breaking and mediating sectors [15]. Un-

der the background, it is the wish of us to ﬁnd a simple model to get the supersymmetry

breaking and soft mass generation dynamically, hopefully under a similar framework. That

is essentially achieved. We just reported our ﬁrst results of a new type of supersymmetric

NJL model with a real two-superﬁeld composite containing a spin one component. Following

and extending the framework of our earlier analyses [13, 14], we have established that the

model has the gap equation of the standard real soft mass parameter of the chiral superﬁeld

bearing nontrivial, hence supersymmetry breaking, solution when the four-superﬁeld cou-

pling is strong enough. The short letter we presented the results [16] only gives a sketch of

the analyses involved and leaves the possibility of a more general supersymmetry breaking

scenario not fully addressed. The current paper is to give a full account of all that.

In Sec.

II, we present the model and the supergraph derivation of the superﬁeld gap

equation, elaborating carefully the extension of our framework of analysis [13, 14] with

model parameters and correlation functions taken as superspace parameters, like constant

superﬁelds, containing supersymmetric and supersymmetry breaking parts. The superﬁeld

gap equation contains components which include wavefunction renormalization factor and

two diﬀerent soft mass parameters. In Sec. III, we discuss the eﬀective theory picture with

the composite and the matching eﬀective potential analysis performed at the component ﬁeld

level, further strengthen the result and illustrate the physics involved. Sec. IV is devoted to

analysis of the nontrivial, supersymmetry breaking solutions. In Sec. V, we go further to

look at some dynamical features of the composite superﬁeld or its various components at low

energy, focusing on the Goldstino mode. Sec. VI is devoted to some further discussion of the

supersymmetry breaking physics. Some remarks and conclusions will be presented in the

last section. Two appendices are given, the ﬁrst on some details of analytical expressions as

background for the eﬀective theory analysis and some results for two-point functions of the

various components of the composite superﬁeld relevant for their low energy dynamics, and

4

the second on propagator expressions for a (chiral) superﬁeld and components admitting the

most general mass parameters. The latter expressions have not been explicitly presented in

the literature.

II. THE MODEL AND THE SUPERFIELD GAP EQUATION

The model has a dimension six four-superﬁeld interaction similar but somewhat diﬀerent

from that of the SNJL model [10, 11, 16]. For the simplest example, we start with the single

chiral superﬁeld (multiplet) Lagrangian 1

in which we have suppressed any multiplet (color) indices. We illustrate here a standard

NJL gap equation analysis [10, 13, 14] applied to the soft supersymmetry breaking mass

parameters, the brief result of which is reported in Ref.[16]. We are mostly interested in the

generation of the usual soft supersymmetry breaking mass ˜m2 for the superﬁeld Φ. Naively, if

the bisuperﬁeld condensate(cid:10)Φ†Φ|D(cid:11) develops, we would have a soft supersymmetry breaking

mass g2

o(cid:10)Φ†Φ|D(cid:11). That is where our key interest is in.

Let us go onto a superﬁeld gap equation analysis following and extending our earlier

formulated framework [13, 14]. To implement an NJL-type gap equation analysis for the

supersymmetry breaking, the ﬁrst step of the self-consistent Hartree approximation is to

add the interested soft mass term −R d4θΦ†Φ ˜m2θ2 ¯θ2 to the free ﬁeld part and re-subtract

it as a mass-insertion type interaction. The formal gap equation is then given by

˜m2 = Σ(loop)

˜m (p)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)on-shell

,

(2)

where Σ ˜m(p) is the two-point proper vertex for the scalar component A of Φ, as shown

in the Fig. 1. Note that the four-superﬁeld interaction, after the d4θ integration, has the
part −g2
oAA†(ΦΦ†)|θ,¯θ=0. We have also performed the calculation fully in the component
ﬁeld framework for case of Ref.[16], but prefer to illustrate the superﬁeld calculation here in

accordance with the formulation under the perspective discussed in Ref.[13]. We consider a
superﬁeld two-point proper vertex ΣΦΦ†(p; θ2, ¯θ2) as taking value like a constant superﬁeld

with components explicitly dependent on θ2 and ¯θ2. The Σ ˜m(p) of interest is then to be
taken essentially as the θ2 ¯θ2 component of ΣΦΦ†(p; θ2, ¯θ2). We have then a full superﬁeld
analog of the gap equation involving the latter, including also the constant component and

the θ2 component (with its conjugate). Potentially, one sees more interesting result options,

like nontrivial solution from the θ2 part of the full superﬁeld gap equation would give an

alternative option of supersymmetry breaking.

Before getting into our formulation, some comments on the symmetry issues are in order.

Apart from supersymmetry itself, the model Lagrangian has, independent of the multiplet

content of Φa, a U(1)R symmetry under which Φa has unit charge. With vanishing mo, it

has a full U(N) symmetry under which the multiplet can be considered in the fundamental

representation. The mo = 0 case is really a main focus for us, though we do not enforce it

in the analysis to keep our result more general. It is important to note that a nonzero mass

is not necessary for our key result here, as presented below. The usual 1/N approximation

picture, however, can still be valid with the mass nonzero. Φa may then be considered as an

SO(N), instead of SU(N), multiplet. In both cases, there is also U(1) Φ-number symmetry

in the Lagrangian which is only violated by the mass term. In the naive case of really a

single superﬁeld, the gap equation analysis here would correspond to the quenched planar

approximation of QED by Bardeen et.al. [18–20], which is commonly believed to give the

correct qualitative result in the kind of dynamical symmetry breaking studies. Some more

discussion of the issue in a somewhat diﬀerent setting is available in Ref.[14]. 2

2 For taking explicitly the single ﬁeld case, there is then no diﬀerence in the four-superﬁeld interaction
considered here comparing to the old SNJL model. However, there are still a few key diﬀerence in our study
compared to that. First, the coupling has diﬀerent signs. Second, we ask and answer a diﬀerent question.
We ask the question if a ¯ΦΦ composite and condensate may form in the absence of supersymmetry breaking
terms in the original Lagrangian. The SNJL work asked if a kind of ΦΦ composite and condensate may

6

To keep notation simple, we will present our analysis here onwards with the index sup-

pressed, as if we are working on a single superﬁeld. What we have in mind is really a

N-multiplet of the SO(N) or SU(N). To retrieve result for a nontrivial N is straightfor-
ward. The one-loop contribution such as the one in ΣΦΦ†(p; θ2, ¯θ2) or Σ ˜m(p) will have to be
multiplied by the factor N.

In the full superﬁeld picture, ΣΦΦ†(p; θ2, ¯θ2) should expand as

ΣΦRΦ†

R

(p; θ2 ¯θ2) = Σr(p) − Σ˜η(p)θ2 − ¯Σ˜η∗(p)¯θ2 − Σ ˜m(p)θ2 ¯θ2 .

(3)

The part Σ ˜m in itself is like a proper self-energy contribution to the scalar but not the
fermion component, hence soft supersymmetry breaking. With Φ = A +√2ψθ + F θ2, it is a
AA∗ vertex. The soft supersymmetry breaking mass ˜m2 as a superﬁeld term is just the θ2 ¯θ2
component of the kinetic term, to which ΣΦΦ†(p; θ2, ¯θ2) is the quantum correction to the
latter. The part Σ˜η is somewhat less obvious. It is a proper vertex of AF ∗, to be matched to
another mass parameter ˜η; the ˜ηAF ∗ term gives another kind of soft supersymmetry break-

ing mass not usually discussed in the literature. 3 Lastly, the supersymmetric part Σr gives

only a kinetic term, hence contributes to wavefunction renormalization. It is then easy to ap-

preciate that a consistent superﬁeld treatment of the standard NJL analysis should consider

modifying the superﬁeld propagator to incorporate plausible nonperturbative parameter of

the generic form given by

Y = y − ˜ηoθ2 − ˜η∗o

¯θ2 − ˜m2

oθ2 ¯θ2

(4)

containing not only the ˜m2 part but also its supersymmetric partners. We write here ˜m2

o in-
stead of ˜m2 as the parameter is not the physical soft mass yet. The component y contributes

a (supersymmetry) wavefunction renormalization factor which renormalizes all mass param-

eters accordingly, as shown below explicitly. Notice that generation of nontrivial y breaks

no symmetry while generation of ˜m2 breaks only supersymmetry. Nonvanishing ˜η however

breaks the U(1)R symmetry together with supersymmetry.

form and got a sure no answer when there is no input supersymmetry breaking terms.

3 Looking at the content of the superﬁeld kinetic term, one sees that it is the parameter for a AF ∗ term.
After elimination of the auxiliary component, we have in general |˜η|2 as an extra contribution to the
scalar mass. In the presence of superﬁeld mass m, or rather M = m − ηθ2, products of ˜ηm and ˜ηη may
contribute to other mass terms. We do not consider any nonzero η here. Note that m, or M with zero
η, is only an input parameter of the original supersymmetric Lagrangian. One can easily see that ˜ηm
contributes a AA mass term after the elimination of the auxiliary component F , giving mass-squared
eigenvalues of |m|2 + |˜η|2 + ˜m2 ± 2|˜η||m| to the two (real) scalar states.

7

To proceed with the derivation of the superﬁeld gap equation, we add and subtract the

term Y ¯ΦΦ and split the Lagrangian as L = Lo + Lint where

(14)

Nontrivial solutions of the three coupled equations with nonvanishing ˜η and/or ˜m2 give

supersymmetry breaking solutions. We postpone the analysis of the nontrivial solution till

after the discussion of the eﬀective theory picture in the next section. Note that nontrivial y

value gives wavefunction renormalization to Φ which does not change the qualitative answer

to if supersymmetry breaking solution with the soft mass generation exists. Our analysis

will explicitly demonstrate that.

III. THE EFFECTIVE THEORY PICTURE

Following the general eﬀective theory picture of the NJL-type models, we modify the

model Lagrangian by adding to it

Ls =Z d4 θ

1
2

(µU + go ¯ΦΦ)2 ,

(15)

where U is an ‘auxiliary’ real superﬁeld and mass parameter µ taken as real and positive

(for g2

o > 0). The equation of motion for U, from the full Lagrangian L + Ls gives

U = −

go
µ

¯ΦΦ ,

(16)

showing it as a superﬁeld composite of ¯Φ and Φ. The condition says the model with L + Ls
is equivalent to that of L alone. Expanding the term in Ls, we have a cancellation of the
dimension six interaction in the full Lagrangian, giving it as

Leff ≡ L + Ls =Z d4θ(cid:20) ¯ΦΦ +

µ2
2

U 2 + µgoU ¯ΦΦ +

mo
2

Φ2δ(¯θ) +

m∗o
2

¯Φ2δ(θ)(cid:21) .

(17)

Obviously, if U|D develops a vacuum expectation value (VEV), supersymmetry is broken
spontaneously and the superﬁeld Φ gains a soft supersymmetry breaking mass of ˜m2
o =

−µgo(cid:10) U|D(cid:11). The above looks very much like the standard features of NJL-type model.

10

Notice that while U does contain a vector component, its couplings diﬀer from that of the

usually studied ‘vector superﬁeld’ which is a gauge ﬁeld supermultiplet. That is in addition

to having µ as like a supersymmetric mass for U, which can be compatible only with a

broken gauge symmetry. As such, model with superﬁeld U is not usually discussed. The

superﬁeld can be seen as two parts, as illustrated by the following component expansion,

U(x, θ, ¯θ) =

(18)

where the components C, χ, and N is the ﬁrst part which has the content of like a chiral

superﬁeld with however C being real. The µ factor is put to set the mass dimensions right.

The rest is like the content of a superﬁeld for the usual gauge ﬁeld supermultiplet, with D

and vµ real. The eﬀective Lagrangian in component form is given by

Notice that like F, N and D have mass dimension two.

Under the U(1)R symmetry, A and F have charge +1 and −1. The superﬁeld U is
uncharged. However, components N, χ and λ carry nontrivial U(1)R charges -2, -1 and +1,

respectively. For the mo = 0 case, there is an extra U(1) Φ-number symmetry with common

charge for all components. All components of U is not charged under the latter.

In accordance with the ‘quark-loop’ approximation in the (standard) NJL gap equation

analysis and our particular supergraph calculation scheme above in particular, we consider

plausible nontrivial vacuum solution with nonzero vacuum expectation values (VEVs) for

the composite scalars C, D and N. While N is complex, we can safely taken n ≡(cid:10)N(cid:11) to be

real here. At least we can exploit the U(1)R symmetry to absorb any phase at the expense

of having a complex mo the phase of which does not show up in the calculation. First

note that scalar C couples to kinetic terms of components of Φ; c ≡(cid:10)C(cid:11) hence contributes

to a supersymmetric wavefunction renormalization of the latter. It is the supersymmetric

11

part of Σ(loop)

ΦΦ† (p; θ2, ¯θ2) an unavoidable part of the one-loop supergraph in our gap equation
calculation in the previous section. Again, we should go to the renormalized superﬁeld

breaking masses ˜η and ˜m2 of ΦR. In the former case, it gives a ARF ∗R component term. Note

ΦR =p(1 + goc)Φ in the following calculations, with renormalized mass m and coupling g.
With n ≡(cid:10)N(cid:11) and d ≡(cid:10)D(cid:11), we have −gn and −µgd corresponding to the supersymmetry
that (cid:10)N(cid:11) is the only VEV that breaks the U(1)R symmetry, as C and D carry no charges,
though both (cid:10)N(cid:11) and (cid:10)D(cid:11) break supersymmetry.

With propagators for the components of the renormalized ‘quark’ superﬁeld ΦR as given

in the appendix, one can easily obtain the minimum condition for the eﬀective potential

following the Weinberg tadpole method [21, 22]. Firstly, for C-tadpoles, we have a ΦR loop

or in component form one from each of AR, ψR, and FR. Hence, we have up to one loop level

To get the physics picture clear, one can identify the soft masses generated for the superﬁeld
Φ by ˜η = −gn and ˜m2 = −µgd. We will explore nontrivial solutions for the soft masses
below.

It is interesting to see that the eﬀective potential analysis for (the components of) the

composite superﬁeld U can be shown directly to be equivalent to the superﬁeld gap equation,

which we illustrated explicitly in Ref.[16] and duplicated here. In terms of the superﬁeld,

the potential minimum condition is given by

µ2(cid:10)U(cid:11) + Utadpole = 0

is the momentum integral of the ΦRΦ†R propagator loop (cf.

assumed, we can obtained −g2(cid:10)(cid:16)ΦRΦ†R(cid:17)(cid:11) = YR, which is equivalent to µg(cid:10)U(cid:11) = YR =

gap equation picture and the eﬀective potential analysis. The results here are in direct

matching with the corresponding discussion for the NJL case presented in Ref.[11], though

for a superﬁeld theory instead. The component ﬁeld eﬀective potential analysis here above

hence really serves as a double-check of the superﬁeld gap equation analysis of the previous

section. In terms of component ﬁelds, we need the soft mass identiﬁcations above as well as

y = goc, or

y

1+y = gc.

IV. SUPERSYMMETRY BREAKING SOLUTIONS

Let us pull together the gap equation in terms of y = (1 − gc)−1, ˜η(= −gn) and ˜m2(=

−µgd). We have

˜η(1 − g2I′N) = 0 and

˜m2 = −g2IC ,

as a set of coupled equations to be solved simultaneously as the integrals are complicated

expressions involving the two soft mass parameters. The third equation of

y = (1 + g2ID)−1

independently gives the y value for any solution of ˜η and ˜m. One can easily check that the

equations are indeed identical to the set of Eq.(14) derived from the original Lagrangian

through the supergraph evaluation. Note that the y parameter does not correspond to any

physical quantity and hence may be considered of little interest. The case of zero soft masses

is consistent, as IC vanishes in the supersymmetric limit. The point of interest is if solutions

of nontrivial supersymmetry breaking masses ˜η and ˜m exist.

The ﬁrst soft mass gap equation gives g2I′N = 1 for nontrivial ˜η, for the case of which we

have

I′N =

1

2(cid:20)(cid:18)1 − |m|

|˜η|(cid:19) IF (m2

where IF (S)(cid:2)≡R E

Similarly, we have

(32)

If we take m = 0, we would have

I′N −→ IF (|˜η|2 + ˜m2)

and

IC −→ − ˜m2IF (|˜η|2 + ˜m2) − 2|˜η|2IF (|˜η|2 + ˜m2) .

The second soft mass gap equation becomes

g2IF (|˜η|2 + ˜m2)(cid:18)1 + 2|˜η|2

˜m2(cid:19) = 1

(33)

which is not compatible with the ﬁrst one (g2I′N = 1) unless ˜η = 0. It remains to see if there
exists ˜η 6= 0 solution for some nonzero values of m. After some algebra, one can rewrite the
solution equations in the form

g2IF (m2
A∓

) = |m| ˜m2 ∓ 2|˜η|(|m| ± |˜η|)2
|m|(2|m|2 − 2|˜η|2 + ˜m2)

+

2|m|(|m| ± |˜η|)
2|m|2 − 2|˜η|2 + ˜m2 g2IF (|m|2) .

(34)

The two equations have the same form with only the |˜η| variable come in diﬀerent signs.
And both reduces to the same equation for the IF (mA) at the |˜η| = 0 limit, which is the
gap equation for the limiting case [16]. Evaluating the integrals with model cutoﬀ Λ, with

all variables and parameters casted in terms of dimensionless counterparts normalized to Λ

4 In connection to the scalar masses, it is interesting to note that nontrivial ˜η also gives spontaneous CP
violation. Though we keep m as a complex parameter in our analysis, its complex phase in the original
Lagrangian is not physical and can be taken away. The original Lagrangian hence conserves CP. Or as
seen here, presence of nonzero m˜η product splits the masses of the scalar and pseudoscalar part of A and
produces mass mixing between them, giving the mass eigenvalues. The surprising part is one only needs
nonzero m˜η to have it, even real value would do.

for z = ∓ |˜η|
|m|
of model parameters G and t. The two equations for positive and negative (but equal)
values of z of course collapse to one at z = 0, which is the vanishing |˜η| solutions which we
presented in Ref.[16]. We duplicate the illustrating plots here in Fig. 4.

Actually, in the ˜η = 0 (z = 0) case, all the above integrals simplify analytically.

In

particular, we have

and

ID −→ IF (|m|2 + ˜m2)

IC −→ −( ˜m2 + 2|m|2)IF (|m|2 + ˜m2) + 2|m|2IF (|m|2)

(I′N is irrelevant). The masses in the Feynman propagators correspond to the scalar and

fermion masses.

It is interesting to note that for m = 0 (t = 0), we have the simple

16

result g2IF ( ˜m2) = 1 5, which is the same as the basic NJL model one except with the

soft mass ˜m2 replacing the (Dirac) fermionic mass (see for example Ref.[11]) if we take
g2
2 as the four-fermion coupling in the model. For more details, we see that solutions for
nontrivial ˜m2 for the case is given by the reduced form of Eq.(35) as 1

obviously giving solution for 0 < s < 1 for the strong enough coupling G > 1. It can be

G = 1 − s ln(cid:2)1 + 1
s(cid:3)

seen from the numerical plot that the value of the ˜m2 solution rises fast with increasing G.

= 1 + 2t

However, nonzero t has a strong limiting eﬀect. It increases the critical coupling needed for
a nontrivial solution to s very substantially. In fact, taking the limit s → 0, the equation
becomes 1
t(cid:1), which gives the critical coupling Gc as a function of
Gc
decreases and reaches vanishing value
t . It can be seen then as t increases from zero,
(i.e. Gc → ∞) at a critical t value of about 0.55, beyond which no coupling G will be strong
enough to break the supersymmetry and generate the soft mass. This part of the results

t+1 − 3t ln(cid:0)1 + 1

1
Gc

has been reported in Ref.[16].

Looking for solution with nontrivial ˜η is more tricky and requires a very careful analysis

scanning the numerical results. Again, we check plots of the eﬀective coupling G as given in

Eq.(35) versus s simultaneously for positive and negative values of z of ﬁxed magnitude, at
a ﬁxed input t value. Numerically, where the two curves (dubbed G+ and G−, respectively)
intersect within the window of interest gives a solution. One only have then to numerically
scan the plots of the G+ and G− curves to see all the solutions. The window of interest is
restricted to positive G value and 0 < s ≤ 1 plus the extra constraint of both of the mass
eigenvalues of the scalar states in Φ to be within the cutoﬀ Λ [cf. Eq.(31)]. This is the
generalization of s ≤ 1 to the nontrivial ˜η, |z| 6= 0 case. The constraint is given by

s + t(1 + |z|)2 ≤ 1 .

(36)

It is strong. For any t value, it ﬁrst restricts |z| of interest to ≤ 1√t − 1. Close to the upper
limit means s admissible has to be very small. So, the constraint may cut out quite a range,

if not all, of the s value of interest. We ﬁnd that solution exists in general, though some of

the features of the solution locations are not somewhat peculiar and not easy to understand.

5 It is interesting to note that in the case we have the gap equation for the renormalization factor, which
is equivalent to the vanishing D-tadpole condition c = −gID, giving c = −gIF ( ˜m2) hence go c = −.5.
The wavefunction renormalization factor is Z = 1 + go c = .5, of order one but tangible. That is a clear
indication of the nonperturbative nature of the results and that there is nothing improper in the analysis.

We scanned on the eﬀective coupling G versus s, |z|, and t plots to study the behavior

somewhat large t, solution exists only at large enough |z|, for example the minimal |z| value
for solution at t = .3 is about 1. Such solution certainly violates (36). Actually, solution

satisfying the constraint shows up only for t below about .265, which also guarantees the

shown. Intersecting points of G+ and G− curves of the same color give the solution point for the

value of |z|.

G+ curve to be smooth at least within the numerical window of interest. Moreover, the G
versus |z| plots for any t and s essentially always give two solutions for (nonzero) |z|. The
larger value |z| solution may not even correspond to a larger coupling G, as shown in Fig. 5.
Also, a G value smaller than the |z| = 0 solution is typical. Another illustration of the same
coupling value issue is given in Fig. 6 in which we show G versus s plots with two intersecting
point, particularly including one with s = 0. Such nonzero |z| with s = 0 solutions are not
available for t less than about .17. For the latter case, the G versus s plots give a single

intersecting point.
In Fig. 7, we show comparisons of the intersecting point solutions at
the same t. We have again solution with larger values of the parameter, s and |z|, for the
masses generated corresponding again to smaller coupling G. Recall the standard, obviously
physical sensible, solution features of the NJL-type model which our |z| = 0 solutions shown
above bears, is that nontrivial symmetry breaking mass solution exists for large enough
coupling beyond a minimal critical value and increases with the coupling. The |z| 6= 0
‘solutions’ behaves, however, in ways diﬃcult to understand. A more careful inspection of
the various plots shows that the G− curve in particular has strange singularities. In fact,
each intersecting point ‘solution’ corresponds to a pair of s and |z| values with the G− curve
either diverging at a smaller s or at a smaller |z| value. It sounds like in order to ‘get’ to

19

that ‘solution’, one has to bring the coupling value all the way to positive or negative inﬁnity

and back. However, it should be note that nonzero ˜η(= |z|√t) increases the mass of one of

the smaller mode but decreases that of the other one [cf. Eq.(31)]. It is not so trivial to
consider if larger ˜η or |z| should really be considered to be giving a larger supersymmetry
breaking eﬀect. Another noteworthy feature is that among solutions of ﬁxed |z| a larger t
generally tends to give smaller s or ˜m2, and among solutions of ﬁxed s, a larger t generally
tends to give larger |z|; larger t always tends to increase coupling G required for a solution.
Recall that the |m| or t value also suppresses the mass generation in the |z| = 0 case, but
|m| = 0 gives certainly no |z| 6= 0 solution.

V. THE GOLDSTINO AND COMPOSITE (SUPER)FIELD DYNAMICS

Some components of the superﬁeld U, which are auxiliary as introduced, develop kinetic

terms through wavefunction renormalizations in the eﬀective theory below the cutoﬀ Λ.

We trace them here through checking of the relevant loop diagrams, based on the eﬀective

Lagrangian in terms of components of ΦR and couplings all having the Φ wavefunction renor-

malization from the gap equation result incorporated [cf. equations in Appendix A]. The

analysis focuses on results at the supersymmetry breaking vacuum solutions, i.e. nonzero

˜m2 with zero or nonzero ˜η. We only sketch the key results here, leaving some more details

in Appendix A.

We start with the two-spinors χ and λ. The chirality conserving part of the self-energy

diagrams give rise to kinetic terms. We can see all terms are nonzero in the presence of

nonvanishing ˜η, while the χ-λ kinetic mixing vanishes at ˜η = 0. Full results are presented

in Appendix A. To look at the mass values is complicated. One needs ﬁrst to take a unitary

transformation on the hermitian matrix and kinetic terms to diagonalize it. Denote the

eigenvalues by Nf1 and Nf2, and the diagonalizing matrix by T . The canonically normalized

fermionic modes are given by

(39)

In the case that the matrix of kinetic terms has the full rank, a zero determinant of det Mf
or equivalently det Mχλ shows the existence of a Goldstino, which is to be expected from
the supersymmetry breaking. We are here mostly interested only in the kind of qualitative

questions here, which saves us from having the deal with the diagonalization of the matrix

of kinetic. For the chirality-ﬂipping diagrams (see Fig. 8), dropping the p-dependent parts,

we have the mass terms

of the gap equations [cf. Eqs.(32) and (30)]. Applications of the gap equations kills the term
with the then vanishing (g2IC + ˜m2g2IN ′) factor and has the −µg2IN ′ term canceling the tree-
level term in the mass matrix Mχλ the determinant of which is then exactly zero. Hence, we
have established the existence of a Goldstino mode for the supersymmetry breaking solution
with ˜η 6= 0. For the ˜η = 0 case, only the oﬀ-diagonal term is nonzero, which is a result one
can see even simply from the U(1)R symmetry considerations. The latter has been presented

in [16], with the result that the tree-level Dirac mass is exactly canceled by Ω-matrix upon
application of the corresponding gap equation giving Mχλ as the zero matrix. Again, we
have the Goldstino. Supersymmetry is really a local/spacetime symmetry. The Goldstino

would eaten up by the gravitino which would than be massive.

VI. SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THE UNCONVENTIONAL FEATURES AND

THE VACUUM SOLUTIONS

The model we have here is quite an unconventional one in many aspects, and hence has

behavior diﬀerent from most of the conventional models to the extent that many ‘generic’

features of superﬁeld theory or theory with spontaneous supersymmetry breaking are simply

not present. That may make some readers uncomfortable or suspicious. Hence, we want

to address the unconventional features directly here as much as we can, in relation to the

validity of our main results of the supersymmetry breaking vacuum solution.

First of all, the basic model Lagrangian is unconventional. It has a four-superﬁeld term

with like the ‘wrong’ sign and unusual color index contraction, say in comparison to the old

SNJL model. The color index contraction gives the NJL-type composite U as an unconven-

tional superﬁeld analysis of which is diﬃcult to ﬁnd in the literature. We will look at that

in more details below. Actually, we are not the ﬁrst to write down a quartic term in the

K¨ahler potential with a negative sign [23]. To see better its unconventional feature, let us

take a look at the component ﬁeld picture of the model. For simplicity, we again drop the

color index from our analysis. The Lagrangian is given by

L = i∂µ

ψψ + h.c.(cid:17) −
¯ψ¯σµψ + ∂µA∗∂µA + F ∗F +(cid:16)mAF −
+2g2A∗A ∂µA∗∂µA − 2g2i∂µ ¯ψ¯σµψA∗A − 2g2i ¯ψ¯σµψA∂µA∗ .

From the equation of motion for the auxiliary ﬁeld F ∗, we have

F = −

(m∗ + g2ψψ)A∗

1 − 2g2|A|2

.

(43)

The somewhat complicated fractional form of F indicates that the component ﬁeld La-

grangian with F eliminated would have less than conventional interaction terms. Naively,

the scalar potential is given by

− Vs = F ∗F − 2g2A∗AF ∗F + mAF + m∗A∗F ∗ .

Eliminating F gives, however,

Vs =

(|m|2 − g4ψψ ¯ψ ¯ψ)|A|2

1 − 2g2|A|2

(44)

(45)

which formally no longer involves only the scalar. It is suggestive of a bifermion condensate

which ﬁts in the general picture of the NJL setting.

It is interesting to note that for

m = 0 the model actually has no pure scalar part in Vs, for any coupling g2. On the

other hand, if one neglects the fermion ﬁeld part in the above, the potential looks simple
enough, Vs = |m|2|A|2
1−2g2|A|2 , with a supersymmetric minimum at zero A. For positive g2, however,
it blows up at |A| = 1/√2g. For a perturbative coupling, one expect 1/g bigger than the
coupling g2, one cannot be so comfortable. In fact, for |A| > 1/√2g, the potential goes

model cut-oﬀ scale Λ, hence the potential is well behaved within the cut-oﬀ. With strong

negative, contradicting our expectation for a supersymmetric model. The analysis so far

suggests compatibility with a plausible nonperturbative supersymmetry breaking. In fact,

the analysis here illustrates clearly that for strong enough coupling the model has no sensible

perturbative vacuum, not even the naive supersymmetric vacuum one may naively expect

to work, at least in the m = 0 case or for large g2.

The nonperturbative NJL-type feature is what gives the model a sensible vacuum. In

fact, the model other than being a superﬁeld one has mostly quite conventional NJL-type
features at least for the ˜m2 6= 0 and ˜η = 0 vacuum. Here below, we mostly address only the
latter case as our supersymmetry breaking solution. Let us now take a look at the scalar

potential in the presence of the composite U, namely as described by the eﬀective theory

Lagrangian, for m = 0 at the tree-level. We have to emphasize that the eﬀective theory

really comes from the NJL-type composite (super)ﬁeld thinking consistence of which asks

for the potential analysis as performed above in Sec. III. We are looking at the tree-level

24

potential here only to illustrate further the unconventional features of the model, here as

given by the eﬀective theory Lagrangian. The potential has the very unconventional form

given by

eff = −F ∗R FR − gCF ∗R FR − µCD − N∗N − µgDA∗RAR − gNARF ∗R − gN∗A∗RFR ,
V tree

(46)

which has vanishing minima both at the trivial supersymmetric origin of the ﬁeld space
except with arbitrary value for AR, and at C = D = 0 and |AR| = 1/g with FR and N =
−gA∗RFR undetermined. The latter potentially supersymmetry breaking minimum is fully
consistent with expressions one may obtain naively for eliminating any of the auxiliary scalars

including F . Taking m = 0 simpliﬁes the analysis. It is also really the most interesting

benchmark case in which there is no input mass parameter at all. Let us emphasize again

that the composite superﬁeld U though has a spin one component vµ is not at all the

conventional real scalar superﬁeld of a gauge boson. Before putting in the ‘quark-loop’

correction, it has no kinetic term and the conventional D2 term is missing.

It is sure

massive, and does not even have the right couplings to be considered as the gauge boson

with broken gauge symmetry.

Eliminating all C, N, and D from V tree

origin Lagrangian. Those conditions are really from the composite condition of U = − g
the NJL wisdom of nontrivial two ﬁeld condensates says exactly that they should not be

µ

eff of course gives back only the Vs potential of the
¯ΦRΦR

applied to the VEVs. A simple conclusion here is that while our gap equations above allows

a supersymmetry preserving solution, the conventional wisdom of that being the preferred

vacuum may not apply. At least there is no indications that the supersymmetry breaking

vacuum is less stable.

In fact, the supersymmetric solution means there is no two-ﬁeld

condensate of Φ except possibly what contributes to (cid:10)C(cid:11). The latter is just a wavefunction

renormalization factor for Φ which is already absorbed in V tree

and gives the same form

eff

for Vs in terms of renormalized quantities. After all, without symmetry breaking two-ﬁeld

condensate is like what one expect with weak g2 coupling, there should not be any composite

ﬁeld degree of freedom and the perturbative tree-level Vs should be expected to give the

correct qualitative feature of the solution. However, the latter looks unstable or sick for

strong enough coupling.

Another point to note is that the gap equation analysis for an NJL-type model always

seems to admit the symmetry preserving solution [11, 13, 14]. However, we can see that the

25

symmetry preserving solution looks applicable only to the case of weak g2, or subcritical G

coupling. The derivations of the gap equation(s) have taken no constraint on the coupling.

Nontrivial solution is not possible with a subcritical coupling. Hence, admitting the trivial

solution is really a like consistence condition. Now if one assumes the composite formation

and looks at the eﬀective theory, the following argument says the trivial, symmetry preserv-

ing solution should not be considered valid. At least in principle, we can take the eﬀective

theory with the ‘quark-loop’ contributions included without putting in any symmetry break-

ing VEVs. That has been done for the NJL and the SNJL models, for example, to retrieve

eﬀective potential for the SM and the (M)SSM [1, 24]. Those scalar potentials do not admit

the symmetry preserving vacuum solutions. We want to emphasize again that the eﬀective

theory picture should be taken as valid only with the strong coupling. Note further that the

gap equations as obtained from the tadpole analysis of the potential for the eﬀective theory

formally gives only vanishing ﬁrst derivative conditions, hence turning points rather than

sure minimum. For the SM or the (M)SSM, the zero VEV symmetry preserving point for

the Higgs potential is sure a turning point, and indeed a local maximum. In that light, the

nature of the supersymmetry preserving point as a vacuum solution may be questionable at

large coupling. That thinking is in consistent with the Vs analysis.

From all the above, we conclude that there is no clear indication of the supersymmetry

breaking vacua being metastable or not stable enough.

It actually may be the preferred

solution for the case of strong coupling. It will of course be very nice if what we argue for

here above can be rigorous demonstrated to be the case with some further analysis, probably

beyond the large N approximation as inherent in the basic NJL-type analysis here. A related

and important issue is the relative stability of the diﬀerent supersymmetry breaking vacua.

While it is diﬃcult to check if the same strong coupling value admits more than one such
vacua, it is seems certain to be the case for the coupling values that admit ˜η 6= 0 solution(s),
as the existence of ˜η = 0 and ˜m2 6= 0 solution is generic once the coupling is beyond the
critical value. The problem is for the nonzero input m case only though.

Another important aspect about our model that some may feel suspicious is its being able

to avoid the vanishing supertrace condition for the mass-squares of the component ﬁelds,

which is in general diﬃcult. However, that the condition was established only for speciﬁc

models of supersymetry breaking rather than as a generic result [25–27], though the class

of models include most of the better known ones.

It sure does not work for the case of

26

an anomalous Fayet-Iliopoulos D-term for example. There is no good reason to assume

any conclusion on the issue about the case of our model. If there is at all any somewhat

similar structure in our model to those more conventional ones in terms of supersymmetry

breaking, it may be with the Fayet-Iliopoulos case with a potential sort of linear in the

D-term. And we sure have no anomaly issue. Our analysis clearly indicates generation of

only soft supersymmetry breaking masses for the scalar component A and not the fermion
ψ. There cannot be any doubt about that. In fact, the m = 0 case with ˜m2 6= 0 and ˜η = 0
solution is even more illustrative. There are clearly masses for A and the composite spin-one

vµ generated, while no mass term for any fermionic mode at all. Avoiding the vanishing

supertrace condition of course is the central feature that we are after, with particularly

interesting application phenomenologically.

VII. REMARKS AND CONCLUSIONS

Dynamical supersymmetry breaking is an interesting and important topic [28]. Our

new simple model with a single chiral superﬁeld (multiplet) should be a great addition to

the latter. The fact that the model has as its direct consequence the generation of soft

supersymmetry breaking masses is specially interesting in view of the requirement of soft

supersymmetry breaking in any low energy phenomenological application of supersymmetry

as in a SSM. We want to emphasize that our key interest is really the case with an SU(N)

multiplet and no input mass parameter, i.e. m = 0. For the case, the analysis can simply

be considered one with the color index hidden so long as we put back the color factor N

in the relevant loop diagrams, basically has the g2 factor in all those results including the

gap equations to be replaced by g2N. We may also take the superﬁeld as like one of the

chiral matter superﬁeld multiplets in the SSM. Together with our earlier HSNJL model

[9, 13], a simple SSM with all (super)symmetry breaking and mass parameters generated

dynamically is easily in sight, though it remains to see if a model with only the SSM

superﬁeld spectrum minus the Higgs supermultiplets can be a consistent model theoretically

and phenomenologically. Even if the answer to the latter question is a no, it looks like

there is at least enough room to have a model with like a single extra chiral superﬁeld to

produce the supersymmetry breaking. We consider a model of such kind quite compelling

as an alternative to the full models of the SSM in the literature having the extra sectors.

27

The current study is a big step in the direction, to which we sure love to further our

investigations. The model mechanism of course may also be applied to other model building

works, for example in addressing the (S)SM ﬂavor structure questions [29].

We take only the case of a simple singlet composite of U ∼ Φ†aΦa here. A somewhat
more complicated case as studied in the case of (non-supersymmetric) NJL-type composite

of spin one ﬁeld [30] would have the composite in the adjoint representation. Similar but

superﬁeld version of four-superﬁeld interactions may be considered though not in relation to

pure soft supersymmetry breaking. It is also possible to have a model in which the composite

superﬁeld U behaves like a massive gauge ﬁeld supermultiplet [31], much in parallel with

the non-supersymmetric models of Ref.[30]. Note again that our current model does not

have the right coupling for the spin one ﬁeld vµ to behave like a gauge boson at all. There
is no A∗vµvµA term in the Lagrangian [cf. Eq.(19) and Eq.(A1)], or no ¯ΦU 2Φ term Eq.(17)

in the superﬁeld picture. It is possible to think about the electroweak gauge bosons as such

composites. However, we echo the author of Ref.[30] against advocating the kind of scenario.

Finally, we emphasize that with the modern eﬀective (ﬁeld) theory perspective, it is the

most natural thing to consider any theory as an eﬀective description of Nature only within

a limited domain/scale. Physics is arguably only about eﬀective theories, as any theory

can only be veriﬁed experimentally up to a ﬁnite scale and there may always be a cut-oﬀ

beyond that. Having a cutoﬀ scale with the so-called nonrenormalizable higher dimensional

operators is hence in no sense an undesirable feature. Model content not admitting any other

parameter with mass dimension in the Lagrangian would be very natural. Dynamical mass

generation with symmetry breaking is then necessary to give the usual kind of low energy

phenomenology such as the Standard Model one. That is actually the key motivation behind

our line of work on the subject matter.

the (original) scalars C, D, and N, we have, in terms of the renormalized components
AR = √ZA, ψR = √Zψ, and FR = √ZF of ΦR = √ZΦ with the common (supersymmetric)

FIG. 10: Diagrams for the generation of kinetic terms for the fermionic modes.

In the following, we present some details of the ‘quark-loop’ contribution to the two-point

functions for the various components of the composite superﬁeld U at the supersymmetry
breaking vacuum solutions, as discussed in Sec. V. Though we argue in the text that ˜η 6= 0
solution does not look acceptable, we present fully generic results for completion. The results

may oﬀer more insight into the problem.

with also the complex conjugates for the last three, i.e. −ΣN ∗N ∗, −ΣCN, and −ΣDN.

It is somewhat of a surprise that all the scalar actually becomes kinetic, including D and

N. The latter are introduced as auxiliary components of mass dimension two. One should

hence consider D

µ has to be expanded into
the real components ﬁrst. One has then to diagonalize the kinetic term matrix for all the

µ instead. For general case, the complex N

µ and N

real scalars to ﬁnd the proper wavefunction renormalization factors for the canonical modes,

and subsequently diagonalize the mass-square matrix, with the tree-level terms included, of

the latter for the eigenvalues.

Appendix B: Propagator expressions for the most general case

We give here the superﬁeld propagator expressions for the most general case, i.e. all soft

supersymmetry breaking parameters are included. The propagator(s) used in our model
above is the case with the soft mass term − 1
2 ηθ2Φ2 in the superpotential vanishing. The
expressions have, apparently, not been explicitly given before, and may be useful in some

future studies.

The free-ﬁeld Lagrangian for a single chiral superﬁeld Φ = A + √2ψθ + F θ2 admitting
all supersymmetric and (soft) supersymmetry breaking mass parameter can be written as

Lo = Z d4θ ¯ΦΦ(1 − ˜ηθ2 − ˜η∗ ¯θ2 − ˜m2θ2 ¯θ2) +(cid:20)Z d2θ

2

(m − ηθ2)Φ2δ2(¯θ) + h.c.(cid:21) . (B1)

Again, we allow a complex m. Soft supersymmetry breaking parameters ˜η and η are also

complex while the most familiar soft mass ˜m2 is real. The superﬁeld propagators are given

Note that the Lagrangian without all the masses has a U(1) and a U(1)R symmetry to

which Φ carries both charges (of 1). U(1)R charges for the components A and F are 1 and

-1, with ψ neutral. We can assign corresponding charges to the mass parameters and use

them to help trace and check the role of the parameters in the component ﬁeld propagators

and the corresponding terms of the superﬁeld propagators.
