Abstract

Explicitly-correlated F12 methods are becoming the ﬁrst choice for high-accuracy molec-

ular orbital calculations, and can often achieve chemical accuracy with relatively small gaus-

sian basis sets. In most calculations, the many three- and four-electron integrals that formally

appear in the theory are avoided through judicious use of resolutions of the identity (RI). How-

ever, in order not to jeopardize the intrinsic accuracy of the F12 wave function, the associated

RI auxiliary basis set must be large. Here, inspired by the Head-Gordon-Pople (HGP) and

PRISM algorithms for two-electron integrals, we present an algorithm to compute directly

three-electron integrals over gaussian basis functions and a very general class of three-electron

operators, without invoking RI approximations. A general methodology to derive vertical,

transfer and horizontal recurrence relations is also presented.

1 Introduction

Many years ago, Kutzelnigg1 showed that introducing the interelectronic distance r12 = |r1 − r2|
into a simple wave function Y

0 for the helium atom, to yield

Y =(cid:16)1 +

r12

2 (cid:17)Y

0 + c (r1,r2),

(1)

where c (r1,r2) is expanded in a determinantal basis, dramatically improves the convergence of
second-order perturbation theory,2 coupled cluster3 and other variational calculations.4 This ap-

proach, which gave birth to the so-called “R12 methods”,2,5,6 is a natural extension of pioneering

work by Hylleraas in the 1920s.7,8

Kutzelnigg’s idea was later generalized to more accurate correlation factors f12 ≡ f (r12).9–14

Nowadays, a popular choice for f12 is a Slater-type geminal15 (STG)

12 = exp(−l r12),
f STG

which is sometimes expanded as a linear combination of gaussian-type geminals9,10 (GTG)

for computational convenience.11,13,14

The resulting “F12 methods” achieve chemical accuracy for small organic molecules with rel-

atively small gaussian basis sets16–20 and are quickly becoming the ﬁrst-choice non-stochastic

method for high accuracy.19,20 They are now appearing within state-of-the-art composite proce-

dures.21

However, whereas a conventional (non-explicitly correlated) calculation using N gaussian one-

electron basis functions leads to an energy expression with O(N4) relatively easy two-electron

integrals,22–32 the explicitly correlated wave function has an energy expression with O(N6) three-

electron integrals and O(N8) four-electron integrals. These many-electron integrals are known in

2

closed form in a few special cases33 but, in general, they are computationally expensive and the

task of computing O(N6) or O(N8) of them appears overwhelming.

To render F12 methods computationally tractable and to avoid these three- and four-electron

integrals without introducing unacceptable errors, Kutzelnigg and Klopper2 proposed to insert the

resolution of the identity (RI)

into the three- or four-electron operators.17,34 In this way, three- and four-electron integrals are ex-

panded in terms of one- and two-electron integrals that can be found efﬁciently using conventional

quantum chemistry software.

Of course, the approximation (??) introduces chemically acceptable errors only if the auxiliary
basis set {c m } is sufﬁciently large (NRI ≫ N). 1 This realization has fueled much research and there
now exist very efﬁcient RI formulations based on highly optimized auxiliary basis sets (ABS)38

and complementary ABS (CABS).39 However, to achieve millihartree accuracy, such bases must

be approximately complete up to 3Locc,17 where Locc is the highest angular momentum of basis

functions in the orbital basis set associated with the occupied molecular orbitals. Even if this

requirement can be reduced to 2Locc by density ﬁtting,40 it remains demanding in cases (e.g. for

transition metals) where high angular momenta are needed in the orbital basis.

For two reasons, however, we believe that the RI tactic can be avoided. First, the number of

signiﬁcant (i.e. greater than a threshold) three- and four-electron integrals is very much smaller

than O(N6) and O(N8), respectively. Second, the task of computing many-electron integrals over

gaussian basis functions is less formidable than many believe. For example, for three-electron

integrals, a reduction of the computational effort from O(N6) to O(N4) is already achievable by

exploiting robust density ﬁtting techniques.41

Although there are O(N4) two-electron integrals, it is well known to quantum chemistry pro-

grammers that the number of signiﬁcant two-electron integrals in a large system is only O(N2)

1For example, for the leﬂunomide molecule C12H9F3N2O2 studied recently by Bachorz et al., 35 the primary aug-

cc-pVTZ and auxiliary 36,37 basis sets have 1081 and 2864 basis functions, respectively.

(cid:229)
if the two-electron operator is long-range42–44 and O(N) if it is short-range.45,46 Similar consid-

erations apply to many-electron integrals and one can show that the number of signiﬁcant three-

and four-electron integrals is only O(N3) and O(N4), respectively, even for long-range operators.

(For short-range operators, there are even fewer.) Thus, if we can ﬁnd good algorithms for iden-

tifying and computing the tiny fraction of many-electron integrals that are signiﬁcant, large-scale

calculations using F12 methods will become feasible, without the need for the RI approximation.

The present manuscript is the ﬁrst of a series on many-electron integrals. Here, we present an

algorithm to compute integrals over three-electron operators using recurrence relations (RRs). The

second paper47 in the series will discuss the construction of upper bounds and effective screening

strategies and the third48 will describe optimized numerical methods for the efﬁcient generation of
[sss|sss] integrals. Our recursive approach applies to a general class of multiplicative three-electron
operators and thus generalizes existing schemes that pertain only to GTGs.10,49–54

Section 2 contains basic deﬁnitions, classiﬁcations of three-electron operators, and permuta-

tional symmetry considerations. In Sec. 3, we propose a recursive algorithm for the computation

of three-electron integrals. Details of a general scheme for deriving three-electron integral RRs are

presented in the Appendix. Atomic units are used throughout.

2 Three-electron integrals

A primitive gaussian-type orbital (PGTO)

a (r) = (x− Ax)ax(y− Ay)ay(z− Az)aze−a |r−A|2
j A

(5)

is deﬁned by its exponent a , its center A = (Ax, Ay, Az), its angular momentum vector a = (ax, ay, az)
and its total angular momentum a = ax + ay + az.
A contracted gaussian-type orbital (CGTO) y A

a (r) is a linear combination of KA PGTOs.

4

We are interested in the three-electron operator

f12 g13 h23 ≡ f (r12) g(r13) h(r23),

(6)

and we write the integral of six CGTOs over this as

ha1a2a3|b1b2b3i ≡ ha1a2a3| f12g13h23|b1b2b3i
a2 (r2)y A3

a1 (r1)y A2

= ZZZ y A1

a3 (r3) f12 g13 h23 y B1
b1

(r1)y B2
b2

(r2)y B3
b3

(r3)dr1dr2dr3.

(7)

We will use square brackets if the integral is over PGTOs:

[a1a2a3|b1b2b3] ≡ [a1a2a3| f12g13h23|b1b2b3]
a2 (r2)j A3

a1 (r1)j A2

a3 (r3) f12 g13 h23 j B1
b1

(r1)j B2

(r2)j B3

(r3)dr1dr2dr3,

and the fundamental integral (i.e. one in which all six PGTOs are s-type) is therefore

[000|000] = S1S2S3ZZZ j Z1

0 (r1)j Z2

0 (r2)j Z3

0 (r3) f12 g13 h23 dr1dr2dr3,

where the exponents z i, centers Zi and prefactors Si of the gaussian product rule for the three
electrons are

z i = a i + b i,
a iAi + b iBi

Zi =
Si = exp(cid:20)−

,

a i + b i
a ib i
a i + b i|Ai − Bi|2(cid:21) .

(10)

(11)

(12)

For conciseness, we will adopt a notation in which missing indices represent s-type gaussians. For

5

example, [a2a3] is a shorthand for [0a2a3|000]. We will also use unbold indices, e.g. ha1a2a3|b1b2b3i
to indicate a complete class of integrals from a shell-sextet.

2.1 Three-electron operators

We are particularly interested in two types of three-electron operators: “chain” operators of the

form f12 g13, and “cyclic” operators of the form f12 g13 h23. In both types, the most interesting

cases arise when2,16–18

and various combinations of these produce three-electron integrals of practical importance. We
note that, by virtue of the identity r12 ≡ r−1
2−2r1·r2), integrals involving the anti-Coulomb
operator can be reduced to linear combinations of integrals over the Coulomb operator.

2.2 Permutational symmetry

For real basis functions, it is known55 that two-electron integrals have 8-fold permutational sym-

metry, meaning that the integrals

ha1a2|b1b2i
ha2a1|b2b1i

hb1a2|a1b2i
hb2a1|a2b1i

hb1b2|a1a2i
hb2b1|a2a1i

ha1b2|b1a2i
ha2b1|b2a1i

are all equal. Three-electron integrals also exhibit permutational symmetry and, for computational

efﬁciency, it is important that this be fully exploited. The degeneracy depends on the nature of the

three-electron operator and the ﬁve possible cases are listed in Table 1.

3 Algorithm

In this Section, we present a recursive algorithm for generating a class of three-electron integrals

of arbitrary angular momentum from an initial set of fundamental integrals. The algorithm applies

to any three-electron operator of the form f12 g13 h23 and generalizes the HGP-PRISM algorithm

following a OTTTCCCTTT pathway.28,31 The algorithm is shown schematically in Fig. 1.

After selecting a signiﬁcant shell-sextet, we create a set of generalized fundamental integrals

[0]m (Step O). Next, we build angular momentum on center A3 (Step T1) and on center A2 (Step

T2) using vertical RRs (VRRs). This choice is motivated by the fact that, for chain operators, the

VRR for building momentum on A1 is more expensive than that for building on A2 and A3 (see

Appendix). Then, using transfer RRs (TRRs), we transfer momentum onto A1 (Step T3). The

primitive [a1a2a3] integrals are then contracted (Step C) and horizontal RRs (HRRs) are used to

shift angular momentum from the bra centers A3, A2 and A1 onto the ket centers B3, B2 and B1

(Steps T4, T5 and T6). The number of terms in each of these RRs is summarized in Table 2 for

cyclic and chain operators. We now describe each step in detail.

3.1 Construct shell-pairs, -quartets and -sextets

Beginning with a list of shells, a list of signiﬁcant shell-pairs32 is constructed. By pairing these

shell-pairs, a list of signiﬁcant shell-quartets is created and then, by pairing the signiﬁcant pairs

and quartets, a list of signiﬁcant shell-sextets is created. This process is critical for the efﬁciency

of the overall algorithm and depends on the use of tight upper bounds for the target integrals.

Such bounds are straightforward for two-electron integrals42–46 but are much more complicated

for three-electron integrals and, for example, the popular Cauchy-Schwartz bound does not gener-

alize easily. However, it is possible to construct a bound for each type of three-electron operator,

depending on the short- or long-range character of f12, g13 and (if it is present) h23. We will discuss

these in detail in Part II of this series.47

Having chosen a signiﬁcant shell-sextet, we replace the three two-electron operators in its funda-

Table 3 contains kernels F(s) for a variety of important two-electron operators f (r12). From the

formulae in Table 3, one can also easily deduce the Laplace kernels for related functions, such as

and the auxiliary index vector m = (m1, m2, m3, m4).

To form an [a1a2a3|b1b2b3] class with a cyclic operator, we require all [0]m with

0 ≤ m1 ≤ a1 + a2 + b1 + b2,
0 ≤ m2 ≤ a1 + a3 + b1 + b3,
0 ≤ m3 ≤ a2 + a3 + b2 + b3,

To form an [a1a2a3|b1b2b3] class with a chain operator, the ranges of m1, m2 and m4 are as in (21),
but m3 = 0.

To construct an haa|aai class of two-electron integrals, one needs only O(a) [0](m) integrals.32
However, it follows from (21) that, to construct an haaa|aaai class of three-electron integrals, we
need O(a3) (for a chain operator) or O(a4) (for a cyclic operator) [0]m integrals. This highlights

the importance of computing these [0]m efﬁciently. If at least one of the two-electron operators

is a GTG, the [0]m can be found in closed-form.57,58 Otherwise, they can be reduced to one- or

two-dimensional integrals, which can then be evaluated by various numerical techniques. This step

can consume a signiﬁcant fraction of the total computation time30 and a comprehensive treatment

of suitable numerical methods merits a detailed discussion which we will present in Part III of this

series.48

3.3 Step T1. Build momentum on center A3

Given a set of [0]m, integrals of higher angular momentum can be obtained recursively, following

Obara and Saika.26,27 Whereas VRRs for two-electron integrals have been widely studied, VRRs

for three-electron integrals have not, except for GTGs.10,49–54

The T1 step generates [a3]m from [0]m via the 8-term VRR (see the Appendix for a detailed

derivation)

3 ]m = (Z3 − A3)[a3]{0} + z 1z 2Y13[a3]{2} + z 1z 2Y23[a3]{3} + (z 1Y13 + z 2Y23)[a3]{4}

2z 3 n[a−3 ]{0} − z 1z 2[a−3 ]{2} − z 1z 2[a−3 ]{3} − (z 1 + z 2)[a−3 ]{4}o ,

(22)

where the superscript + or − denotes an increment or decrement of one unit of cartesian angular
momentum. (Thus, a± is analogous to a± 111i in the notation of Obara and Saika.) The value in the
curly superscript indicates which component of the auxiliary index vector m is incremented.

For a chain operator, the {3} terms disappear, yielding the 6-term RR

3 ]m = (Z3 − A3)[a3]{0} + z 1z 2Y13[a3]{2} + (z 1Y13 + z 2Y23)[a3]{4}
[a+

2z 3 n[a−3 ]{0} − z 1z 2[a−3 ]{2} − (z 1 + z 2)[a−3 ]{4}o .

(23)

It is satisfying to note that, by setting z 2 = 0 in (??), we recover the Obara-Saika two-electron RR.

3.4 Step T2. Build momentum on center A2

The T2 step forms [a2a3] from [a3]m via the 10-term RR

2 a3]m = (Z2 − A2)[a2a3]{0} + z 1z 3Y12[a2a3]{1} − z 1z 3Y23[a2a3]{3} + (z 1Y12 − z 3Y23)[a2a3]{4}

3.5 Step T3. Transfer momentum to center A1

The T3 step generates [a1a2a3] from [a2a3]. There are two possible ways to do this. The ﬁrst, which

we call Step T′3, is to build angular momentum directly on A1 using the 12-term VRR (Eq. (??)).
However, this is computationally expensive and we choose to avoid it. A second option exploits

the translational invariance

At this stage, following the HGP algorithm,28 we contract the [a1a2a3|000] to form the ha1a2a3|000i.
We can perform the contraction at this point because all of the subsequent RRs are independent of

the contraction coefﬁcients and exponents. More details about this contraction step can be found

in Ref. 32.

3.7 Steps T4 to T6. Shift momentum to ket centers

We shift momentum to B3, B2 and B1 from A3, A2 and A1, respectively, using the 2-term HRRs

ha1a2a3|b+

3 i = ha1a2a+
2 b3i = ha1a+
1 b2b3i = ha+

3 |b3i + (A3 − B3)ha1a2a3|b3i ,
2 a3|b2b3i + (A2 − B2)ha1a2a3|b2b3i ,
1 a2a3|b1b2b3i + (A1 − B1)ha1a2a3|b1b2b3i .

4 Concluding remarks

In this Article, we have presented a general algorithm to construct three-electron integrals over

gaussian basis functions of arbitrary angular momentum from fundamental (momentumless) inte-

grals. The algorithm is based on vertical, transfer and horizontal RRs in the spirit of the Head-

Gordon-Pople algorithm. In Part II of this series, we will report detailed investigations of upper

bounds on these integrals. In Part III, we will discuss efﬁcient methods for computing the funda-

mental integrals. Our approach can be extended to four-electron integrals, and we will also report

results on this soon.

A Derivation of VRRs

In this Appendix, we follow the Ahlrichs approach59 to derive a VRR for the construction of [a1]m

integrals.

Deﬁning the scaled gradient operator

we can write the Boys relation22

ˆDA1 =

(cid:209) A1
2a 1

,

1 ] = ˆDA1[a1] +
[a+

a1
2a 1

[a−1 ],

(31)

(32)

which connects an integral of higher momentum to an integral derivative with respect to a coordi-

nate of A1.

In operator form, this can be written as

[a+

1 ] = ˆMa1

ˆDA1[0] +

a1
2a 1

[a−1 ].

Substituting the chain rule expression

ˆDA1 =

(cid:209) A1S1

the commutator property

ˆMa1 p = p ˆMa1 + a1r

ˆMa−1

,

(where p is linear in A1 and r

is its derivative) and the identities

ˆDA1(Z1 − A1) = −
ˆDA1Y12 = ˆDA1Y13 =

one eventually obtains the 8-term RR for building on A1

1 ]m = (Z1 − A1)[a1]{0} − z 2z 3Y12[a1]{1} − z 2z 3Y13[a1]{2} − (z 2Y12 + z 3Y13)[a1]{4}

2z 1 n[a−1 ]{0} − z 2z 3[a−1 ]{1} − z 2z 3[a−1 ]{2} − (z 2 + z 3)[a−1 ]{4}o .

(38)

(39)

(40)

(41)

Equation (??), which builds on A3, can be derived similarly. However, for chain operators, the RR

that builds on A1 does not shed terms and it is therefore cheaper to build on A3 than on A1.

Equation (??) can be derived using the relation

2 a3]m = ˆMa3[a+
[a+

2 ]m,

(42)

and the 12-term VRR for building on A1 in Step T′3 is

1 a2a3]m = ˆMa3
[a+

ˆMa2[a+

1 ]m

= (Z1 − A1)[a1a2a3]{0} − z 2z 3Y12[a1a2a3]{1}
− z 2z 3Y13[a1a2a3]{2} − (z 2Y12 + z 3Y13)[a1a2a3]{4}
2z 1 n[a−1 a2a3]{0} − z 2z 3[a−1 a2a3]{1} − z 2z 3[a−1 a2a3]{2} − (z 2 + z 3)[a−1 a2a3]{4}o
2 nz 3[a1a−2 a3]{1} + [a1a−2 a3]{4}o +

2 nz 2[a1a2a−3 ]{2} + [a1a2a−3 ]{4}o .
