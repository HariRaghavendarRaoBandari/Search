Remarks on Frankl’s conjecture

Francesco Marigo∗ and Davide Schipani†

Abstract

First a few reformulations of Frankl’s conjecture are given, in terms
of reduced families or matrices, or analogously in terms of lattices.
These lead naturally to a stronger conjecture with a neat formulation
which might be easier to attack than Frankl’s. To this end we prove
an inequality which might help in proving the stronger conjecture.

Introduction

Frankl’s conjecture, also called union-closed sets conjecture, is a well
known open problem in combinatorics since 1979. The simple and
elementary formulation can certainly account in part for the appeal
of the problem. Brieﬂy, a family of sets is said to be union-closed if
the union of any two sets of the family is still part of the family; the
conjecture states that for any ﬁnite union-closed family of ﬁnite sets,
other than the family consisting only of the empty set, there exists
an element that belongs to at least half of the sets in the family. A
dual intersection-closed sets formulation exists as well. A survey of
the state of the art can be found in [2].

The aim of this paper is to present new reformulations, which lead
naturally to a stronger conjecture. The strucure of the paper is as
follows. Section 2 ﬁxes the notation and deﬁnitions which will be
used throughout the paper. Section 3 presents a few reformulations
of the conjecture in terms of reduced families, matrices and lattices.
In particular the matrix setting will be mostly exploited, although, as
shown in Section 2, there exists a correspondence among all settings.
Section 4 presents a stronger conjecture, which naturally derives from
a reformulation of the previous section. It has a neat formulation in
terms of cardinality of intersections or in terms of matrices. Section
5 proves a combinatorial inequality strictly related to the stronger
conjecture.

2 Notation and deﬁnitions

In this section we set the terminology used in the paper. First of all,
we remark that all sets in this paper are ﬁnite. Terms not deﬁned here
and statements without proof are either covered in the literature, for
example [1, 2, 3], or are a direct consequence of deﬁnitions, possibly
after a bit of elaboration.

Let F be a family of subsets of a nonempty set S such that:

• ∅ and S belong to F;

• for every x ∈ S, there are A, B ∈ F such that A \ B = {x}.

We call F a reduced family on S. If it holds

• for all A, B ∈ F, also A ∩ B belongs to F,

we say that F is a reduced intersection-closed family. If it holds

• for all A, B ∈ F, also A ∪ B belongs to F,

we say that F is a reduced union-closed family. The family of com-
plements of sets in a reduced intersection-closed family is a reduced
union-closed family and vice-versa.

There is a direct correspondence between reduced families and lat-
tices.
Indeed, the members of a reduced intersection-closed (union-
closed) family F form a lattice with respect to set inclusion. The
other direction can be shown as follows. Let L be a lattice (we al-
ways assume that a lattice have at least two elements). A ﬁlter of
L is an upward closed and meet-closed subset of L, an ideal of L is
a downward closed and join-closed subset of L. We say that a ﬁlter
(ideal) A is irreducible if it is not the intersection of any set of ﬁlters
(ideals) which does not have A as member. We write J for the family
of irreducible ﬁlters of L and I for the set of irreducible ideals of L.
For a ∈ L, we write Ja for the subset of J of all the irreducible ﬁlters
which contain a, and Ia for the subset of I of all the irreducible ideals
which do not contain a. Then

• the family of all Ja’s, for a ∈ L, is a reduced intersection-closed

family on J ;

• the family of all Ia’s, for a ∈ L, is a reduced union-closed family

on I.

And the lattice of the members of either of the two families, ordered
by set inclusion, is isomorphic to L.

Now, let F = {A1, . . . , Am} be a nonempty family of subsets of a
nonempty set S = {x1, . . . , xn}. We call characteristic matrix of F

2

the matrix F ∈ Qm×n with elements

F (h, k) =(cid:26) 1

0

if xk ∈ Ah
if xk /∈ Ah.

A matrix F ∈ Qm×n is the characteristic matrix of some reduced
family iﬀ:

• there is h ∈ {1, . . . , m} such that F (h, k) = 0 for all k ∈ {1, . . . , n};

• there is h ∈ {1, . . . , m} such that F (h, k) = 1 for all k ∈ {1, . . . , n};

• the rows are all diﬀerent;

• for all k ∈ {1, . . . , n} there are two rows which diﬀer only at the

k-th column (hence the columns are all diﬀerent).

The characteristic matrix of a reduced family is the characteristic
matrix of some reduced intersection-closed family iﬀ:

• for all h, i ∈ {1, . . . , m}, there is j ∈ {1, . . . , m} such that

F (j, k) = F (h, k)F (i, k) for all k ∈ {1, . . . , n};

it is the characteristic matrix of some reduced union-closed family iﬀ:

• for all h, i ∈ {1, . . . , m}, there is j ∈ {1, . . . , m} such that
F (j, k) = F (h, k) + F (i, k) − F (h, k)F (i, k) for all k ∈ {1, . . . , n}.

We call reduced intersection-closed (union-closed) matrix a character-
istic matrix of some reduced intersection (union) closed family. We
write Qm×n
) for the set of m × n reduced intersection-closed
(union-closed) matrices.

(Qm×n

∩

∪

We write Fx for the subfamily of F of all the sets which contain
x. As usual, |A| is the cardinality of the set A. We write ek for the
k-th unit coordinate vector, that is the vector with all components 0
except the k-th component, which is equal to 1. If there is no risk
of confusion, we write shortly ΣX, Σx for the sum of all the elements
of a matrix X or a vector x, respectively. Furthermore, the vectors
written in matrix form are columns, that is a × 1 matrices.

3 Equivalent formulations

is not restrictive.
It is straightforward to check that the following
statements are all equivalent. Each equivalent formulation of the con-
jecture is followed by a reinforced statement, which corresponds to a
stronger conjecture by B. Poonen [4, 2].

3

Conjecture 3.1. Let L be a lattice, J the set of its irreducible ﬁlters.
Then,

2 min{|A| : A ∈ J } ≤ |L|.

Reinforcement: The inequality is strict unless L is a Boolean lat-

tice.

Conjecture 3.2. Let L be a lattice, I the set of its irreducible ideals.
Then,

2 max{|AC | : A ∈ I} ≥ |L|.

Reinforcement: The inequality is strict unless L is a Boolean lat-

tice.

Conjecture 3.3. Let F be a reduced intersection-closed family on S.
Then,

2 min{|Fx| : x ∈ S} ≤ |F|.

Reinforcement: The inequality is strict unless F is the powerset of

S.

Conjecture 3.4. Let F be a reduced union-closed family on S. Then,

2 max{|Fx| : x ∈ S} ≥ |F|.

Reinforcement: The inequality is strict unless F is the powerset of

S.

Conjecture 3.5. Let F ∈ Qm×n be a reduced intersection-closed ma-
trix. Then,

2 min{Σ[F ek] : k = 1, . . . , n} ≤ m.

Reinforcement: The inequality is strict unless m = 2n

Conjecture 3.6. Let F ∈ Qm×n be a reduced union-closed matrix.
Then,

2 max{Σ[F ek] : k = 1, . . . , n} ≥ m.

Reinforcement: The inequality is strict unless m = 2n.
We refer to any of these equivalent conjectures and their reinforce-

ments as (reinforced) Frankl’s conjecture.

Let ∆n ⊆ Qn be the (n − 1)-dimensional symplex generated by

unit coordinate vectors ek, for k ∈ {1, . . . , n}, that is

∆n = {x ∈ Qn : xk ≥ 0 (k = 1, . . . , n), Σx = 1}.

Proposition 3.1. Frankl’s conjecture is equivalent to the following
statement.

4

Conjecture 3.7. Let F ∈ Qm×n be a reduced union-closed matrix.
Then, there is x ∈ ∆n such that 2Σ[F x] ≥ m.

Proof. (of Proposition 3.1). Conjecture 3.6 is a particular case of
Conjecture 3.7. Conversely, suppose that Conjecture 3.6 do not hold.
Then, for every k ∈ {1, . . . , n} it is 2Σ[F ek] < m. Therefore, for every
x ∈ ∆n it would hold

2Σ[F x] = 2

n

Xi=1

xiΣ[F ei] ≤ 2 max{Σ[F ek] : k = 1, . . . , n} < m,

hence Conjecture 3.7 would not hold.

The formulation of Conjecture 3.7 suggests a strategy to try to
solve the problem. We illustrate this strategy by stating another con-
jecture, clearly equivalent to Conjecture 3.7:

Conjecture 3.8. There is a weight function w : Qm×n
∪ → ∆n such
that, for every reduced union-closed matrix F ∈ Qm×n, the following
holds: 2Σ[F w(F )] ≥ m.

The strategy, then, becomes to ﬁnd a proper weight function w,

and the rest of the paper will be in this direction.

We choose a simple sequence of functions (w0, w1, w2 . . .) where, if
Frankl’s conjecture holds, a function wr can be found which satisﬁes
Conjecture 3.8. Let wr : Qm×n
∪ → ∆n be the function which sends a
matrix F to a vector whose components are proportional to the r-th
powers of the sums of columns:

[wr(F )]k =

(Σ[F ek])r
i=1(Σ[F ei])r .
Pn

The more r increases, the more the weight is concentrated on the
column of highest sum. Hence,

Proposition 3.2. Reinforced Frankl’s conjecture is equivalent to the
following statement.

Conjecture 3.9. Let F ∈ Qm×n be a reduced union-closed matrix.
Then, there is r ∈ N such that 2Σ[F wr(F )] ≥ m.

Proof. (of Proposition 3.2). We prove ﬁrst that reinforced Conjecture
3.6 implies Conjecture 3.9 in case m 6= 2n. If reinforced Conjecture
3.6 holds, then

2 lim
t→∞

Σ[F wt(F )] = 2 max{Σ[F ek] : k = 1, . . . , n} > m,

5

hence there is r which satisﬁes Conjecture 3.9. In the other direction
Conjecture 3.9 implies Conjecture 3.7, therefore Conjecture 3.6. For
the case m = 2n, for any t we have all equalities

2Σ[F wt(F )] = 2 max{Σ[F ek] : k = 1, . . . , n} = m,

as Σ[F wt(F )] is the same for every t, being a weighted mean of ele-
ments all equal to m/2.

Conjecture 3.9 has a nice interpretation in terms of union-closed

families.

Proposition 3.3. Conjecture 3.9 is equivalent to the following state-
ment.

Conjecture 3.10. Let F be a reduced union-closed family on a set S.
Then, there is r ∈ N such that the average cardinality of intersections
of r-tuples of members of F is not greater than twice the average car-
dinality of intersections of (r+1)-tuples of members of F, in formulas:

2PA∈F r+1 |T A|

|F|r+1

≥ PA∈F r |T A|

|F|r

.

Proof. (of Proposition 3.3). Conjecture 3.9 states, equivalently, that
there is r ∈ N such that

Translating this inequality in terms of the union-closed family we have

2Pn
i=1(Σ[F ei])r+1
i=1(Σ[F ei])r ≥ m.
Pn
2Px∈S |Fx|r+1
Px∈S |Fx|r ≥ |F|,
≥ Px∈S |Fx|r

|F|r

2Px∈S |Fx|r+1

|F|r+1

which can be written as

.

The thesis follows from the equalities

4 A stronger conjecture

If r = 0 in Conjecture 3.10, then the inequality becomes

2PA∈F |A|

|F|

≥ |S|,

which means that the average cardinality of members of F is at least
half of the cardinality of S. This is not true in general, a coun-
terexample is the family F = {∅, {a}, {b}, {a, b}, {a, b, c}} on the set
S = {a, b, c}.

If r = 1 in Conjecture 3.10, then the inequality becomes

2P(A,B)∈F 2 |A ∩ B|

|F|2

≥ PA∈F |A|

|F|

.

We have not found counterexamples to this inequality, which is clearly
stronger than Frankl’s conjecture. We do not have counterexamples
to the analogous inequalities for r > 1 either, but from now on we
restrict our attention to the case r = 1, which admits a particularly
simple formulation. Of course, this case would become of little interest
regarding Frankl’s conjecture, once a counterexample be found. We
refer to the inequality for r = 1 and equivalent ones as strong union-
closed sets conjecture:

Conjecture 4.1. Let F be a reduced union-closed family on a set S.
Then, the average cardinality of members of F is not greater than twice
the average cardinality of intersections of ordered pairs of members of
F.

The inequality of Conjecture 4.1 can be written as

|A ∩ B| ≥ X(A,B)∈F 2

2 X(A,B)∈F 2
|A ∩ B| ≥ X(A,B)∈F 2

X(A,B)∈F 2

|A|,

(|A| − |A ∩ B|) ,

X(A,B)∈F 2

|A ∩ B| ≥ X(A,B)∈F 2

|A \ B|.

Hence we have the reformulation:

Conjecture 4.2. Let F be a reduced union-closed family on a set S.
Then, the average cardinality of diﬀerences of ordered pairs of mem-
bers of F is not greater than the average cardinality of intersections
of ordered pairs of members of F.

7

Adding the inequality of Conjecture 4.2 with the analog one with
the role of A and B switched, and the equality of the sum of intersec-
tions with itself, we obtain

3 X(A,B)∈F 2

|A ∩ B| ≥ X(A,B)∈F 2

|A ∪ B|.

Hence we have the reformulation:

Conjecture 4.3. Let F be a reduced union-closed family on a set
S. Then, the average cardinality of unions of ordered pairs of mem-
bers of F is not greater than three times the average cardinality of
intersections of ordered pairs of members of F.

We translate the strong union-closed conjecture in terms of union-
closed matrices. Let F = {A1, . . . , Am} be a nonempty family of
subsets of a nonempty set S = {x1, . . . , xn}, and F its characteristic
matrix. We write F T for the transpose of F and F for the charac-
teristic matrix of the family of complements of members of F, that is
F (h, k) = 1 − F (h, k). The following equalities are straightforward:

[F F T ](h, k) = |Ah ∩ Ak|,

T

[F F
](h, k) = |Ah \ Ak|,
[F F T ](h, k) = |Ak \ Ah|,

T

[F F

](h, k) = |AC

h ∩ AC
k |.

Then, Conjecture 4.2 becomes:

Conjecture 4.4. Let F be a reduced union-closed matrix. Then, it
holds

T

Σ[F F T ] ≥ Σ[F F
],
Σ[F F T ] ≥ Σ[F F T ].

5 A useful inequality

In support of Conjecture 4.2, we prove an inequality which holds for
any nonempty family F of subsets of a nonempty set S. For every
A, B ∈ F, let A ⊕ B be the symmetric diﬀerence, corresponding to
the Boolean XOR operation and A ⊗ B be the complement of the
symmetric diﬀerence, corresponding to the Boolean XNOR operation.
Basic equalities are:
A ⊕ B = (A ∪ B) ∩ (AC ∪ BC), A ⊕ B = (A \ B) ∪ (B \ A),
A ⊗ B = (A ∩ B) ∪ (AC ∩ BC), A ⊗ B = (A → B) ∩ (B → A),
A ⊗ B = (A ⊕ B)C.

8

Proposition 5.1. Let F be a nonempty family of subsets of a nonempty
set S. Then, the average cardinality of symmetric diﬀerences of or-
dered pairs of members of F is not greater than the average cardinality
of complements of symmetric diﬀerences of ordered pairs of members
of F. In formulas,

X(A,B)∈F 2

|A ⊗ B| ≥ X(A,B)∈F 2

|A ⊕ B|.

The inequality is strict unless every x ∈ S belongs to exactly half of
the members of F.

Proposition 5.2 follows from the next proposition. for every x ∈ S,

let δx = |Fx| − |F C

x | = |{A ∈ F : x ∈ A}| − |{A ∈ F : x /∈ A}|.

Proposition 5.2. Let F be a nonempty family of subsets of a nonempty
set S. Then,

X(A,B)∈F 2

|A ⊗ B| = X(A,B)∈F 2

|A ⊕ B| +Xx∈S

δ2
x.

Proof. Let A, B ∈ Qm×n be two matrices. It holds

(A − B)(A − B)T = AAT − ABT − BAT + BBT ,

hence

Σ[AAT ] + Σ[BBT ] = Σ[ABT ] + Σ[BAT ] + Σ[(A − B)(A − B)T ].

For a matrix C ∈ Qm×n, the number ΣCC T is the scalar product of
the vector, sum of all the rows of the matrix, with itself, indeed

ΣCC T =

ΣCC T =

Then, for F characteristic matrix of F, putting together the previous
equalities with A = F , B = F and C = A − B we have

This equality, translated in terms of the family of sets, becomes

X(A,B)∈F 2

(|A ∩ B| + |AC ∩ BC|) = X(A,B)∈F 2

whence the thesis follows.

9

From the last equality it follows directly:

Proposition 5.3. Let F be a reduced union-closed family on a set S.
If

X(A,B)∈F 2

|A ∩ B| +Xx∈S

δ2

x ≥ X(A,B)∈F 2

|AC ∩ BC|,

then Conjecture 4.2 is true.
