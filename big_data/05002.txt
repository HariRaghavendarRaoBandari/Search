Abstract: Tensor network (TN) methods, in particular the Matrix Product States (MPS)
ansatz, have proven to be a useful tool in analyzing the properties of lattice gauge theories.
They allow for a very good precision, much better than standard Monte Carlo (MC) tech-
niques for the models that have been studied so far, due to the possibility of reaching much
smaller lattice spacings. The real reason for the interest in the TN approach, however, is its
ability, shown so far in several condensed matter models, to deal with theories which exhibit
the notorious sign problem in MC simulations. This makes it prospective for dealing with
the non-zero chemical potential in QCD and other lattice gauge theories, as well as with
real-time simulations. In this paper, using matrix product operators, we extend our analysis
of the Schwinger model at zero temperature to show the feasibility of this approach also at
ﬁnite temperature. This is an important step on the way to deal with the sign problem of
QCD. We analyze in detail the chiral symmetry breaking in the massless and massive cases
and show that the method works very well and gives good control over a broad range of
temperatures, essentially from zero to inﬁnite temperature.

Investigations of gauge ﬁeld theories within the Hamiltonian approach have progressed sub-
stantially in the last years with the help of tensor network (TN) techniques [1–3]. Taking
the example of the Schwinger model, numerical calculations have been performed to in-
vestigate ground state properties [4–9], to demonstrate real-time dynamics [10, 11] and
to address the phenomenon of string breaking [12, 13], which has also been explored in
non-Abelian models [14]. In Refs. [15–17], thermal properties of the Schwinger model were
studied for massless fermions. From a more conceptual point of view, TN have been devel-
oped that incorporate the gauge symmetry by construction, and constitute ground states of
gauge invariant lattice models [18–21]. Yet a diﬀerent line of work is the study of potential
quantum simulations of these models, using ultracold atoms, see Refs. [22–24] for a review.
Also in this ﬁeld, TN techniques can play a determinant role to study the feasibility of the
proposals [25].

The last numerical developments go beyond standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MC-
MC) methods. At zero temperature, the Hamiltonian approach allows us to go substantially
closer to the continuum limit and reach a much improved accuracy compared to MC-MC.
When temperature is switched on, a broad and very large set of non-zero temperature
points can be evaluated, ranging from very high to almost zero temperature. In the string
breaking calculation, a nice picture of the string breaking phenomenon and the emergence of
the hadron states can be demonstrated. Finally, real-time simulations are not even possible
in principle with MC-MC methods.

The key to this success is the employment of tensor network states and, in the case
of one spatial dimension, as for the Schwinger model, the Matrix Product States (MPS).
In this approach, which is closely linked to the Density Matrix Renormalization Group
(DMRG) [26], the problem, which has an exponentially large dimension in terms of the

– 1 –

system size, is reduced to an –admittedly– sophisticated variational solution which can
be encoded in substantially smaller D × D matrices. The ansatz can represent arbitrary
states in the Hilbert space if D is large enough (exponential in the system size). Instead
in numerical applications, usually an approximation is found to the desired state within
the set of MPS with ﬁxed D. By varying D, an extrapolation of results to D → ∞ can
be performed allowing thus to reach the solution of the real system under consideration.
A diﬀerent approach also using tensor network techniques was applied to the Schwinger
model with a topological θ-term in Refs. [27, 28], where the exact partition function on the
lattice was expressed as a two dimensional tensor network and approximately contracted
using the Tensor Renormalization Group (TRG).

The application of the MPS technique discussed in the present paper is concerned with
In Refs. [15–17], we have for
non-zero temperature properties of the Schwinger model.
the ﬁrst time investigated the thermal evolution of the chiral condensate in the Schwinger
model. In the ﬁrst paper, where we only studied the massless case, we could demonstrate
that the MPS technique can be successfully used to compute such a thermal evolution from
very high to almost zero temperature. For massless fermions, the results from our MPS
calculation could be confronted with the analytical solution of Ref. [29] and a very nice
agreement was found demonstrating the correctness and the power of the MPS approach.
In the present paper, we will extend our calculations of the thermal evolution of the
chiral condensate to the case of non-vanishing fermion masses. Here, no exact results exist
anymore, but only approximate solutions are available [30] which can be tested against our
results. For our work at zero fermion mass, we also introduced a truncation of the charge
sector [15] which was necessary to obtain precise results at high temperature. Here, we will
employ this truncation method, too.

It needs to be stressed that the calculations with MPS, as performed here, have a
number of systematic uncertainties which are very important to control. This concerns in
particular:

• an estimate of results for inﬁnite bond dimension; 1
• an extrapolation to zero step size in the thermal evolution process;
• a study of the truncation in the charge sector of the model;
• an inﬁnite volume extrapolation;
• and a careful analysis of the continuum limit employing various extrapolation func-

tions with diﬀerent orders in the lattice spacing.

Controlling these systematic eﬀects renders the calculations with MPS demanding, but
it is absolutely necessary to obtain precise and trustworthy results. We have therefore
made a signiﬁcant eﬀort to perform the above extrapolations and we will provide various
examples in this paper for the studies of systematic eﬀects carried through here.

1For a given system size, N , exact results would actually be attained with ﬁnite bond dimension, D =

2N/2[31], which is many orders of magnitude larger than the largest one we use in the simulations.

2 The Schwinger model and chiral symmetry breaking

The one-ﬂavour Schwinger model [32], i.e. Quantum Electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions,
is one of the simplest gauge theories and a toy model allowing for studies of new lattice
techniques before employing them to real theories of interest, like Quantum Chromodynam-
ics (QCD). Despite its apparent simplicity, it has a non-perturbatively generated mass gap
and shares some features with QCD, such as conﬁnement and chiral symmetry breaking,
although the mechanism of the latter is diﬀerent than in QCD – it is not spontaneous, but
results from the chiral anomaly.

We start with the Hamiltonian of the Schwinger model in the staggered discretization,

derived and discussed in Ref. [33]:

H = x

n σ−n+1 + σ−n σ+

N−2

Xn=0(cid:2)σ+

≡ Hhop + Hm + Hg,

n+1(cid:3) +

µ
2

N−1

Xn=0h1 + (−1)nσz

ni +

[L(n)]2

(2.1)

N−2

Xn=0

where n is the site index, x = 1/g2a2, a is the lattice spacing, g is the coupling, and
µ = 2m/g2a with m denoting the fermion mass and N the number of lattice sites. We use
open boundary conditions (OBC). The gauge ﬁeld, L(n), can be integrated out using the
Gauss law:

L(n + 1) − L(n) =

1

2(cid:2)(−1)n+1 + σz

n+1(cid:3) .

(2.2)

Thus, only L(n) at one of the boundaries is an independent parameter and we take L(0) = 0,
i.e. no background electric ﬁeld.

We work with the following basis for our numerical computations: |s0s1 ··· i [6], where
sn = {↓,↑} is the spin state at site n and all the gauge degrees of freedom have been
integrated out.

In this paper, we are interested in the chiral symmetry breaking (χSB) in the Schwinger
model, both at zero and non-zero temperature. The order parameter of χSB is the chi-

n

g√x

ral condensate Σ = (cid:10) ¯ψψ(cid:11), which can be written in terms of spin operators as Σ =
N Pn(−1)n 1+σz

. The ground state and thermal expectation values of the chiral conden-
sate diverge logarithmically in the continuum limit for non-zero fermion mass [34–36]. This
divergence is present even in the non-interacting case, where the theory is exactly solvable
and the Hamiltonian (2.1) reduces to the XY spin model in a staggered magnetic ﬁeld. The
ground state energy of this model (with OBC) reads: E0
N +1 .
The ground state expectation value of Σ can then be computed from the derivative dE0

(2.3)

The free condensate value computed from this formula can be used to subtract the diver-
gence in the interacting case at a ﬁnite lattice size N , a ﬁnite lattice spacing 1/√x and a
given fermion mass m/g. However, one can exactly evaluate the inﬁnite volume limit of the

Σfree(m/g, x) =

(2.4)

g2x

where K(u) is the complete elliptic integral of the ﬁrst kind [37]. Note that by expanding
this expression in the limit x → ∞, the divergent logarithmic term 1
m
g log x is indeed seen
already in the free case. In this way, we can extrapolate our lattice interacting condensate
Σ(m/g, x, N ) ﬁrst to inﬁnite volume limit, Σ(m/g, x), at a ﬁnite x and a given m/g and
then subtract the inﬁnite volume free condensate (Σfree(m/g, x)) given by Eq. (2.4):

2π

Σsubtr(m/g, x) = Σ(m/g, x) − Σfree(m/g, x),

(2.5)

obtaining ﬁnally the subtracted condensate Σsubtr(m/g, x), which can then be extrapolated
to the continuum limit x → ∞. Note that a non-zero temperature does not bring any
further divergence, hence the above renormalization scheme, subtracting the zero temper-
ature free condensate in the inﬁnite volume limit, can be applied for any T . Actually, one
can equivalently subtract the free condensate at any ﬁnite T . This deﬁnes an alternative
renormalization scheme that we can also implement. Both options would lead to the cor-
rect value at T = 0, i.e. compatible with the one directly obtained from the ground state
calculations, but in order to compare to other results in the literature, we adopt in the
following the T = 0 renormalization scheme for all temperatures.

In the massless case, the temperature dependence of the chiral condensate was com-

puted analytically by Sachs and Wipf [29]:

1−ex cosh(t) , γ ≈ 0.577216 is the Euler-Mascheroni constant and mγ =
g/√π is the non-perturbatively generated mass of the lowest lying boson (the vector boson).
According to the above formula, chiral symmetry is broken at any ﬁnite temperature (zero
or non-zero) and it gets restored (Σ = 0) only at inﬁnite temperature. There is no phase
transition, i.e. chiral symmetry restoration is smooth.

In the massive case, there is no analytical formula describing the temperature de-
pendence of the condensate. However, the massive model was treated by Hosotani and
Rodriguez with a generalized Hartree-Fock approach in Ref. [30], yielding an approximate
thermal dependence of Σ. In the following, we will confront our results with ones from this
approximation and thus conclude about its validity.

3 Tensor network approach

In this work, we make use of two diﬀerent applications of tensor network ansatzes.
In
order to obtain the results at zero temperature, we approximate variationally the ground
state of the Schwinger model Hamiltonian (2.1) on a ﬁnite lattice using a MPS. For the

– 4 –

temperature dependence, we employ the matrix product operator (MPO) to describe the
thermal equilibrium states at ﬁnite temperatures.

Although the details of these ansatzes and the basic algorithms involved can be found
in the literature, for completeness we compile in this section the fundamental ideas of both
approaches, with special emphasis on the particularities associated to the problem at hand.

Given a system of N sites, a MPS [31, 38, 39] is a state of the form

|Ψi =

d−1

Xi0,...iN −1=0

tr(Ai0

0 . . . AiN −1

N−1 )|i0 . . . iN−1i,

(3.1)

k, which have dimension D × D, except for the ones at the edges, Ai

where d is the dimension of the local Hilbert space for each site. For two-level quantum
systems, as in the case we are studying, d = 2. The state is parametrized by the dN
matrices, Ai
0 and
Ai
N−1, which, for the open boundary conditions we consider, are D-dimensional vectors.
The parameter D is called the bond dimension, and determines the number of variational
parameters in the ansatz. The MPS can eﬃciently approximate ground states of local
gapped Hamiltonians in one spatial dimension, and the ansatz lies at the basis of the
success of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method [26, 39]. In practice,
they have been successfully applied to much more general problems, including long range
interactions and two dimensional systems.

Diﬀerent algorithms exist to ﬁnd an MPS approximation to the ground state of a certain
Hamiltonian. We use a variational search [31, 39], in which the energy is minimized over
the set of MPS with a given bond dimension, D, by successively optimizing over one of the
tensors, while keeping the rest ﬁxed. The procedure is repeated, while sweeping over all
the tensors, until convergence is attained in the value of the energy, to a certain relative
precision, εtol, ultimately limited by machine precision. The computational cost of this
procedure scales as O(dD3) with the dimensions of the tensors. The eﬀect of running the
algorithm with a limited bond dimension is to suﬀer a truncation error. By running the
algorithm with increasing values of D, we can estimate the magnitude of this error and
extrapolate to the 1/D → 0 limit, as discussed in detail in Sec. 4.

Our previous works [6, 7] demonstrated that the MPS ansatz provides very good ap-

proximations to the ground state and lower lying excited states of the Schwinger model.

The MPS ansatz can be extended to the description of operators, and in particular

density matrices [40–42]. A matrix product operator (MPO) is thus of the form

ρ = X{ik,jk}

Tr(cid:0)M [0]i0j0 ··· M [N − 1]iN −1jN −1(cid:1)|i0 . . . iN−1ihj0 . . . jN−1|.

(3.2)

While any MPS (3.1) can represent a valid physical state, as far as it is normalized, in order
to describe a physical density operator, the MPO needs in addition to be positive. This
condition cannot be guaranteed locally for generic tensors M [k]. However, it is possible to
ensure the positivity of a MPO using the puriﬁcation ansatz [40, 43], in which each tensor
of the MPO has the form M [k]ij
ℓr . This corresponds to a (pure state) MPS
˜ℓ˜r
ansatz for an extended chain, with one ancillary system per site, such that ρ is the reduced

ℓ′r′∗Ajp

state for the original system, obtained by tracing out the ancillas. It has been shown that
thermal equilibrium states of local Hamiltonians can be well approximated by this kind of
ansatz [44, 45] in arbitrary dimensions.

In the case of ﬁnite temperature, a MPO approximation can be constructed for the
Gibbs state via imaginary time evolution of the identity operator [40], ρ(β) ∝ e−βH =
e− β
2 H, where β ≡ 1/T is the inverse temperature. To achieve this, we apply a
second order Suzuki-Trotter expansion [46, 47] to the exponential, and approximate every
step of width δ = β/M by a product of ﬁve terms,

2 H 1e− β

e−βH ≈he− δ

2 HeiM

2 Hee− δ

2 Hz e−δHo e− δ

2 Hz e− δ

,

(3.3)

where Hz = Hm + Hg is diagonal in the z basis, and the hopping term is split in two sums
Hhop = He + Ho, with the He (Ho) term containing the two-body terms that act on each
even-odd (odd-even) pair of sites. If each of the exponential terms can be exactly computed,
the error of this approximation scales as O(δ2). The exponentials of He and Ho have indeed
an exact MPO expression with constant bond dimension 4. The term Hz contains long
range interactions, but its structure allows us to also write it exactly as a MPO, with bond
dimension (N + 1), as detailed in Ref. [15]. The only non-vanishing elements of the tensors
specifying the MPO are (M ii
n)ii], where
hn = µ
N−1(cid:3). The virtual
bond then carries the information about the electric ﬂux on each link, which can assume
values Ln ∈ [−N/2, N/2]. Instead of working with the exact exponential of Hz, which has
a bond dimension N + 1, we ﬁnd it convenient, given the large system sizes we want to
study, to truncate the dimension of the MPO, by deﬁning a maximum value the virtual
bond can attain, |Ln| ≤ Lcut. This is equivalent to truncating the physical space to those
states where the electric ﬂux on a link cannot exceed Lcut and is thus related to approaches
where one explicitly truncates the maximum allowed occupation number of the bosonic
gauge degrees of freedom [10].

n] + L2

Starting with the identity operator, ρ(0), which has a trivial expression as a MPO with
bond dimension one, we successively apply steps of the evolution, using the approximation
above, and approximate the result by a MPO with the desired maximum bond dimension.
This is achieved with the help of a Choi isomorphism [48], |iihj| → |ii⊗|ji, to vectorize the
density operators, such that the MPO is transformed in a MPS, with physical dimension per
site d2, on which the evolution steps act linearly. The approximated eﬀect of the evolution
is then found by minimizing the Euclidean distance between the original and ﬁnal MPS.
The procedure can be repeated until inverse temperature β/2 is reached. Then we construct
ρ(β) ∝ ρ(β/2)†ρ(β/2) (up to normalization) such that the puriﬁcation ansatz is realized and
we ensure a positive thermal equilibrium state. The computational cost of this calculation
is the same as that of time evolution of a MPS state, with the increased physical dimension,
i.e. it scales as O(d2D3).

Using the MPO ansatz with limited bond dimension induces also a truncation error
in the T > 0 case, which is not equivalent to the one described for T = 0. First of all,
diﬀerent ansatzes are used for both cases, and while the MPS truncation in the pure state

– 6 –

case can be related to the entanglement in the state, the same is not true for the MPO
ansatz in the case of mixed states. 2 Moreover, the distinct numerical algorithms used in
both cases also mean that errors are introduced in diﬀerent ways. In the thermal algorithm,
each application of one of the exponential factors in (3.3) potentially increases the bond
dimension of the resulting MPO. Hence, after every step, the ansatz needs to be truncated
to the maximum desired value of the bond dimension.
In practice, this is achieved by
minimizing a cost function that corresponds to the Frobenius norm of the diﬀerence to
the true evolved operator. As in the ground state search, this optimization is done by an
alternating least squares (ALS) scheme, in which all tensors but one are ﬁxed, and repeated
sweeping is performed over the chain. Also in this case, we use a tolerance parameter, εtol,
to decide about the convergence of the iteration, but now the value bounds the relative
change in the cost function during the sweeping that follows the application of each single
exponential factor. This procedure leads to errors accumulating along the thermal evolution,
and while at β = 0 the state can be exactly written as a MPO with D = 1, the largest
truncation errors will occur for the lowest temperatures. Thus, recovering zero temperature
results from such a procedure is a non-trivial check that the method is working correctly.
The T = 0 calculation, in contrast, does not suﬀer from this eﬀect, as it directly targets
the ground state variationally.

Additionally, the Suzuki-Trotter expansion (3.3) introduces another systematic error
in the thermal evolution, by using a ﬁnite step width δ, which we need to extrapolate to
δ → 0, and another one in the form of the truncation of the physical subspace to a maximum
Lcut, described above. All these factors need to be taken into account when performing
the extrapolations required to extract the continuum values of the observables under study
(see Sec. 4 for details).

4 Results

4.1 Zero temperature

We begin with our results for the ground state chiral condensate for various fermion masses.
For the massless case, an analytical result can be obtained, Σ/g = eγ/2π3/2 ≈ 0.159929.
We are able to reproduce this number with great accuracy and also obtain results in the
massive case, where no analytical results exist.

Our numerical procedure consists in computing several sets of data points corresponding

to diﬀerent values of (D, N , x) and extrapolating in the way described below.
Inﬁnite bond dimension (D → ∞) extrapolation. We use several values of D ∈
[40, 160] to check the eﬀects from changing the bond dimension. Our ﬁnal value is taken
as the condensate corresponding to the largest computed value of D = 160 and its error as
the diﬀerence between the value for D = 160 and D = 140. The lower values of D serve to
ensure that the two highest bond dimensions are large enough, such that it can be argued
that the diﬀerence between D = ∞ and D = 160 is smaller than the one between D = 160
and D = 140, which makes our error estimate valid.

2In the case of operators one should instead talk about operator space entanglement entropy, a measure

A typical example of such extrapolation is shown in Fig. 1 for x = 200 and in Fig. 2
for x = 10, at m/g = 0.125. In both cases, we observe very good convergence towards the
1/D = 0 limit, with the above deﬁned error from this step being of O(10−9) for the former
and O(10−12) for the latter. This error is represented by a red band. Note that despite
going to D = 160, the convergence in bond dimension is so good that actually even with
D = 40 we would already obtain the result with an outstanding precision, of O(10−8) for
x = 200 (i.e. only an order of magnitude worse than with D = 160) or even of O(10−12)
for x = 10 (i.e. the same as with D = 160). The x = 10 case illustrates that in some cases
the convergence in D is so good that our uncertainty comes from issues with the numerical

related to truncation error in the MPO that was introduced in Ref. [49].

they are too small to be seen.

precision. The MPS optimization procedure is considered to be converged when the relative
change in the ground state energy in subsequent sweeps falls below a certain tolerance
parameter, taken to be εtol = 10−12 in our case. Notice, however, that this precision refers
to the ground state energy, which typically converges better than other observables, so it
will correspond to a somewhat worse precision in the chiral condensate, which we estimate
to be in the 10−11−10−10 region. In the x = 10 case, the variation of Σ/g values for diﬀerent
D becomes smaller than this, which explains the irregular behaviour of the D-dependence
for this case (left plot of Fig. 2), compared to the apparently regular convergence for the
case x = 200. We account for this bias (that happens only for our smallest x values) in
our next step, the inﬁnite volume extrapolation. We emphasize that this is deﬁnitely not a
drawback of the method, but even better precision could be attained for certain parameter
ranges with the same D values, by adopting a more demanding convergence criterion. On
the other hand, since the ultimate limit of machine precision, which we label by ǫnum, aﬀects
the optimization of individual tensors, so that after one sweep over the whole chain, it may
aﬀect the value of the energy in O(N ǫnum). This means that for chains of hundreds of sites,
as required for the largest values of x we explore, εtol = 10−12 is the best allowed by double
precision numerics.
Inﬁnite volume (N → ∞) extrapolation. The results corresponding to our estimates
of the D → ∞ limit can then be extrapolated to inﬁnite volume by using a linear ﬁtting
ansatz:

Σ(m/g, x, N ) = Σ(m/g, x) +

,

(4.1)

α(m/g, x)

N

where Σ(m/g, x, N ) is the inﬁnite-D condensate for a ﬁxed fermion mass, volume and lattice
spacing. The ﬁtting parameters are Σ(m/g, x) (inﬁnite volume condensate at a given lattice
spacing and fermion mass) and the mass and lattice spacing-dependent slope of the ﬁnite
volume 1/N correction, α(m/g, x). We show an example of such extrapolation in Fig. 3,
again for x = 10 (left) and x = 200 (right), at m/g = 0.125. We always choose the volumes
to be large enough, such that the above linear ﬁtting ansatz yields a good description of

– 9 –

data. We have found that this holds when the volumes used are scaled proportionally to √x
and we take N = {22√x, 26√x, 30√x, 32√x, 34√x}. Indeed, in all cases where no issues

with machine precision are observed, this leads to very good ﬁts. The resulting error of
the ﬁtting coeﬃcient Σ(m/g, x) is the propagated error from the D-extrapolation. For very
small values of x (lower than approx. 30), we need to deal with the numerical precision bias.
The errors from the D-extrapolation are in such case underestimated, since they do not
take into account the ﬁnite numerical precision. This leads to χ2/dof values of O(10− 100).
However, we know from the analysis for large values of x that the linear ﬁtting ansatz (4.1)
yields an excellent description of data, with χ2/dof usually much smaller than 1. Hence, we
account for the bias by inﬂating the D-extrapolation errors to such levels that χ2/dof = 1
by construction. In this way, the ﬁnal error after the inﬁnite volume extrapolation step is
properly rescaled and becomes comparable to the one at larger x (e.g. approx. 8.2·10−10 for
x = 10 and 6.3· 10−9 for x = 200). In the end, all our errors of inﬁnite volume condensates,
Σ(m/g, x), diﬀer by less than an order of magnitude in the whole considered range of x and
for all fermion masses.
Continuum limit (x → ∞) extrapolation. Finally, the inﬁnite volume results Σ(m/g, x)
can be extrapolated to the continuum limit. First, we subtract the inﬁnite volume free
condensate according to Eq. (2.5), obtaining the subtracted condensate Σsubtr(m/g, x).
Then, we apply the following ﬁtting ansatz:

Σsubtr(m/g, x) = Σsubtr(m/g) +

a(m/g)

√x

log(x) +

b(m/g)
√x

+

c(m/g)

x

,

(4.2)

with ﬁtting parameters Σsubtr(m/g) (the continuum condensate for a given fermion mass),
a(m/g), b(m/g) and c(m/g). This is a ﬁtting ansatz quadratic in the lattice spacing (the role
of the lattice spacing is played by 1/√x), with logarithmic corrections. The latter appear
already in the free theory, where their presence can be shown analytically (see Sec. 2). Note
that the ﬁnal result obtained from this procedure will, to some extent, depend on the ﬁtting
range in 1/√x. To quote ﬁnal values independent from such choices, we adopt a systematic
procedure analogous to the one we used in our spectrum investigation in the Schwinger
model, described in detail in the appendix of Ref. [6]. In short, this consists in performing
ﬁts in diﬀerent possible ﬁtting ranges by varying the minimal and maximal values of x
entering the ﬁts. The number of ﬁts that we obtain in this way is of O(100) and allows
us to build a distribution of the continuum values, weighted with exp(−χ2/dof) of the ﬁts.
The ﬁnal value that we quote is the median of the distribution and the systematic error
from the choice of the ﬁtting range comes from the 68.3% conﬁdence interval (such that
in the limit of inﬁnite number of ﬁts it corresponds to the width of a resulting Gaussian
distribution). This error is then combined in quadrature with our propagated error from
D- and N -extrapolations, which we take as the error of one selected ﬁt, taken to be the one
in the interval x ∈ [20, 600].

Our continuum limit extrapolations are shown in Fig. 4 for all fermion masses that we
considered. We show in these plots the ﬁt from which we estimated our propagated error
from earlier extrapolations (x ∈ [20, 600]), i.e. one of the ﬁts that enter the distribution
built to assess our ﬁnal values and their uncertainties. The ﬁnal values for each fermion

4.2 Thermal evolution

In our previous papers [15–17], we showed results for the temperature dependence of the
chiral condensate in the massless case. We employed a method without any truncations in
the gauge sector and found that it is numerically very demanding to achieve lattice spacings
small enough to reliably extrapolate to the continuum at high temperatures. This led us
to the method of introducing a ﬁnite cut-oﬀ, Lcut, in the gauge sector and we showed that
this method works very well in the massless case, allowing for good precision of results for
the whole range of temperatures. In the present paper, we test the method, explained in
detail in Sec. 3, in the massive case. Although this method is diﬀerent from the one used for
T = 0, the analysis procedure at a given temperature is rather similar to the one described
in the previous subsection. We begin by shortly outlying the new parts of the analysis in
the thermal case. In the following, we typically express the temperature with its inverse,
β ≡ 1/T .

There are two new parameters with respect to T = 0 computations, apart from the
bond dimension, D, the system size, N , and the inverse coupling, x — the Lcut parameter
describing the cut-oﬀ in the gauge sector and the step width, δ. Thus, our sequence of
extrapolations follows the order given below.

Inﬁnite bond dimension (D → ∞) extrapolation. This extrapolation is done as
in the T = 0 case and we again take the result at our largest D as the central value and
the diﬀerence between this value and one at (D − 20) as the estimate of the uncertainty
from the ﬁnite bond dimension. Examples of such extrapolations are shown in Figs. 5 and
6, for x = 9 and x = 1024, respectively (both at m/g = 0.25, gβ = 0.5, Lcut = 10). They
illustrate a general feature in the D-dependence of the chiral condensate — the convergence
becomes worse towards the continuum limit. However, this convergence is in all cases good
— the diﬀerence between our two largest bond dimensions (140 and 160) is of O(10−9) at
x = 9 and of O(5 · 10−5) at x = 1024. This diﬀerence also depends on the temperature

have error bars, but they are too small to be seen.

— since lower temperatures are reached by increasing gβ, the error from the ﬁnite bond
dimension also increases at increasing gβ, approximately linearly. Note that in the thermal
case, the convergence in D is somewhat worse than at T = 0 and we do not observe issues
with insuﬃcient machine precision (cf. Sec. 4.1 and the comments about double precision
as not enough for certain parameter ranges). Finally, there is little dependence on the value
of δ, the volume and on the fermion mass.
Zero step width (δ → 0) extrapolation. We denote the results from the previous step
as Σ(m/g, x, N, δ) and they diﬀer from the δ = 0 limit by O(δ2). Hence, we extrapolate to
δ = 0 with:

Σ(m/g, x, N, δ) = Σ(m/g, x, N ) + r(m/g, x, N )δ2,

(4.3)

with the ﬁtting parameters Σ(m/g, x, N ) and r(m/g, x, N ). We always use three values of
δ for each (m/g, x, N ), which allows us to verify that a ﬁtting ansatz linear in δ2 is proper.
Since we want to access inverse temperatures gβ ∈ [0, 8] with a step of ∆gβ = 0.1, we use
values of δ small enough such that this is possible. Examples are shown in the lower right

the resulting errors are the propagated errors from the D-extrapolation, one again observes
similar parameter dependences for the error obtained at this step. We also note that the
linear ansatz (4.3) works very well.
Inﬁnite volume (N → ∞) extrapolation. The results corresponding to our esti-
mates of the D → ∞ and δ → 0 limits are extrapolated to inﬁnite volume by using
the same kind of linear ﬁtting ansatz as in the T = 0 case, i.e. Eq. (4.1), and volumes
N = {16√x, 20√x, 24√x}. An example extrapolation is shown in Fig. 7, for m/g = 0.25,

Lcut = 10, ﬁve values of the lattice spacing and two temperatures: gβ = 0.5 (left) and
gβ = 4 (right). As in the T = 0 case, we observe that the ﬁtting ansatz gives very good
description of our data.
Removing the Lcut cut-oﬀ (Lcut → ∞ extrapolation). The physical results have to
be independent of the used gauge sector cut-oﬀ. We found empirically that for all ranges
of our parameters, Lcut = 10 always yields results compatible with Lcut = 8 and Lcut = 12.

Hence, this value of Lcut is eﬀectively Lcut = ∞ and no explicit extrapolation is needed
(see also Ref. [15]).
Continuum limit (x → ∞) extrapolation. As our ﬁnal step, we perform the continuum
limit extrapolation of the inﬁnite volume results Σ(m/g, x). Before this is done, we sub-
tract the inﬁnite volume free condensate according to Eq. (2.5) and obtain the subtracted
condensate Σsubtr(m/g, x). We consider the following three ﬁtting ansatzes:

which diﬀer by the order of the polynomial in 1/√x. We refer to them as linear+log,
quadratic+log and cubic+log, respectively. We observe that the discretization eﬀects are
very diﬀerent at diﬀerent temperatures, in particular these eﬀects become very strong at
high temperatures and a polynomial cubic in 1/√x is needed to obtain a good description
of data. We adopt a modiﬁed procedure to obtain the systematic error from the choice
of the ﬁtting range and the ﬁtting ansatz. The procedure used to analyze the T = 0
data is inappropriate here, because of the large dependence of the uncertainty from the
D-extrapolation on the lattice spacing. This uncertainty at a ﬁne lattice spacing (x =
100 − 500) is up to four orders of magnitude larger than the one for our coarsest lattice
spacings. Hence, the analogue of the weighted histogram built at T = 0 is no longer
reliable, as it contains ﬁts with very large uncertainties. This does not happen at T = 0,
where the ﬁne lattice spacings have only slightly larger uncertainties from the D and N -
extrapolations than the coarse lattice spacings. This reﬂects the diﬀerence in strategies used
to approximate thermal and ground states as tensor networks. In practice, it translates into

– 15 –

a somewhat diﬀerent manner the truncation errors are accumulated in the thermal evolution
with respect to the T = 0 algorithm. At large gβ, i.e. after several steps of imaginary time
evolution, the truncation errors are much larger than in the ground state. As a consequence,
the T = 0 procedure of obtaining the systematic error does not make sense in the T > 0
case, since only one or two ﬁts dominate the weighted histogram.

For this reason, the procedure to extract the ﬁtting range/ansatz uncertainty is the
following. It is performed separately for each temperature gβ at a given fermion mass m/g.
We ﬁx the maximum x entering each ﬁt to be the one corresponding to the ﬁnest lattice
spacing. Then, we build all possible ﬁts of Eqs. (4.4)-(4.6) changing only the minimal en-
tering x (xmin). We take as the central value Σ(i)
subtr(m/g) that corresponds to the smallest
uncertainty propagated through D, δ and N -extrapolations, but one that satisﬁes the con-
dition χ2/dof ≤ 1 and has all its ﬁtting coeﬃcients statistically signiﬁcant. We denote it
by Σsubtr(m/g) and its error by ∆Σsubtr(m/g). We combine this uncertainty quadratically
with the uncertainty from the choice of the ﬁtting interval, ∆intervalΣsubtr(m/g), and from
the choice of the ﬁtting ansatz, ∆ansatzΣsubtr(m/g). The former is deﬁned as the diﬀerence
between Σsubtr(m/g) and the most outlying Σ(i)
subtr(m/g) (corresponding to the same (i),
i.e. the same functional form of the ﬁtting ansatz) which has still all the ﬁtting coeﬃcients
statistically signiﬁcant. The latter is taken to be the diﬀerence between Σsubtr(m/g) and
the most outlying Σ(j)
subtr(m/g) (where (j) 6= (i), i.e. from another ﬁtting ansatz) which has
again statistically signiﬁcant ﬁtting coeﬃcients.

Below, we illustrate this procedure with a few examples at the fermion mass m/g = 0.25
(Fig. 8). We start with a low temperature, gβ = 6, eﬀectively corresponding to T = 0 (after
a certain m-dependent gβ, the continuum result does not change any more — in the case
of m/g = 0.25, zero temperature is reached around gβ = 6). Here, taking the linear+log
ﬁtting ansatz and xmin = 9 yields a good ﬁt, with χ2/dof ≈ 0.07. It can be compared to
only two other ﬁts, both of them linear+log, with xmin = 16 and xmin = 25. Increasing
xmin further or changing the ﬁt form to quadratic+log or cubic+log leads to at least one
of the ﬁtting coeﬃcients becoming statistically insigniﬁcant. Hence, our ﬁnal result for
this temperature and fermion mass is Σsubtr(∆)(∆interval)(∆ansatz) = 0.0657(3)(43)(0) and
is dominated by the uncertainty from the choice of the ﬁtting interval. The error from
the choice of the ﬁtting ansatz is zero, since no quadratic+log or cubic+log ﬁt produces
a signiﬁcant result. Since gβ = 6 is eﬀectively T = 0, this result can be compared to our
T = 0 result at this fermion mass in Tab. 1. We observe full consistency, although the
precision of the thermal computation is four orders of magnitude worse than of the ground
state one. This is hardly surprising, as thermal evolution is deﬁnitely not the best method
to investigate ground state properties.

Another example continuum extrapolation is shown for gβ = 2 (upper right plot of
Fig. 8).
In this case, the central value comes from a linear+log ﬁt with xmin = 16
and it is compared to the same functional form of the ﬁt with xmin = 49 as well as
to a quadratic+log ﬁt with xmin = 16. Finally, we get Σsubtr(∆)(∆interval)(∆ansatz) =
−0.0078(0.3)(36)(38). Towards higher temperatures, cut-oﬀ eﬀects become increasingly
important, in the sense that one needs higher order polynomials in 1/√x. For gβ = 0.4
(lower left of Fig. 8), the central value that we take comes from a quadratic+log ﬁt

with xmin = 25, compared to xmin = 121 and a cubic+log ﬁt with xmin = 81. This
leads to Σsubtr(∆)(∆interval)(∆ansatz) = −0.229(0.05)(6)(11). Our ﬁnal example is gβ =
0.2 (lower right of Fig. 8). Here, the central value comes from a cubic+log ﬁt with
xmin = 64, compared to xmin = 144 and a quadratic+log ﬁt with xmin = 144. We get
Σsubtr(∆)(∆interval)(∆ansatz) = −0.297(0.14)(3)(7).
In all these cases, the error is domi-
nated by the uncertainty from the choice of the ﬁtting interval and ansatz. Nevertheless,
with the adopted systematic error estimation procedure, one can have these uncertainties
reliably under control.

We repeat the analysis steps for all our fermion masses and we summarize the continuum
limit results in Fig. 9, where we show results up to gβ = 8 (m/g = 0.0625 and 0.25) or
gβ = 6 (m/g = 0.125, 0.5, 1). The most important feature conﬁrming the validity of
our results is that we always reproduce the T = 0 result within our errors — actually
the diﬀerence between our central values at large enough gβ and the T = 0 MPS result
is much smaller than our errors, suggesting that the error estimation procedure is rather
conservative. We also note that our systematic error procedure makes the ﬁnal errors
strongly dependent on temperature — with sometimes irregular jumps of the error caused

by some other ﬁtting interval or ﬁtting ansatz entering the procedure at certain gβ values3.
Apart from the agreement with the T = 0 result, we observe that the approach to this
result is faster for higher fermion masses — for m/g = 1, gβ = 3 is already eﬀectively zero
temperature, while for our lowest mass, m/g = 0.0625, we have small changes of the central

statistically signiﬁcant and thus enlarge our error.

value even above gβ = 6. Concerning the agreement with the approximation of Ref. [30]
(referred to as “Hosotani HF” in the plot), the latter provides good qualitative description of
the temperature dependence of the chiral condensate. However, the quantitative agreement
is not perfect, with typical deviations of 10-20%.
It is known that the approximation
becomes exact in the massless limit and indeed, e.g. Hosotani’s T = 0 result at m/g =
0.0625 is relatively closer to the MPS result than the one at m/g = 0.125. On the other
hand, the approximation of Ref. [30] also approaches the analytical result of zero at inﬁnite
fermion mass and T = 0 — hence one also expects an increasing agreement in this regime.
Indeed, the relative diﬀerence at m/g = 1 is the smallest from among all our considered
masses. However, when we consider the slope of the gβ-dependence, we clearly observe that
the agreement between Hosotani HF and our computation becomes better towards small
fermion masses, with both curves being almost parallel for m/g = 0.0625.

5 Summary and prospects

In this paper, we have performed a study of the temperature dependence of the chiral con-
densate for the one-ﬂavour Schwinger model using a Hamiltonian approach. We emphasize
that while for zero temperature we employ a matrix product state (MPS) ansatz, for non-
vanishing temperature we use a matrix product operator (MPO) ansatz. In addition, for
the non-zero temperature calculation, we have to perform a thermal evolution by starting
from a well deﬁned inﬁnite temperature state and evolve the system in incremental inverse
temperature steps towards zero temperature using a density operator.

Thus, non-zero temperature calculations within the Hamiltonian approach are rather
diﬀerent from the so far carried out zero temperature ones and hence non-zero temperature
computations for gauge theories are novel and need to be tested. While in Ref. [15] we
have initiated such non-zero temperature computations for massless fermions, in this paper
we went substantially beyond this work by studying the system at various fermion masses.
In addition, we employed consistently a truncation of the gauge sector. This allowed us
to reach very large system sizes and, keeping the physical extent of the model ﬁxed, very
small values of the lattice spacing.

Within our calculation of the chiral condensate, we carried out a substantial and chal-
lenging eﬀort to control the systematic eﬀects. To this end, we performed extrapolations to
zero thermal evolution step size, inﬁnite bond dimension, inﬁnite volume and zero lattice
spacing.
In addition, we tested that our cut parameter for the gauge sector truncation
has been suﬃciently large. The ﬁnal non-trivial check of the validity of our approach has
been to recover the zero temperature result of the chiral condensate after the long thermal
evolution performed.

As a result of our work, we could compute the chiral condensate over a broad temper-
ature range from inﬁnite to almost zero temperature with controlled errors. This has been
done for zero, light and heavy fermion masses. For zero fermion mass, we found excellent
agreement with the analytical results of Ref. [29]. Moving to non-zero fermion masses, a
comparison to Ref. [30] did not lead to a clear conclusion, see Fig. 9. Although qualita-
tively the temperature dependence of the chiral condensate shows a comparable behaviour

– 19 –

between the analytical result of Ref. [30] and our data, there does not seem to be an agree-
ment on the quantitative level. This is presumably due to the fact that the approximations
made in Ref. [30] are too rough to reach a satisfactory quantitative agreement.

We consider the here performed work, besides of the clear interest in its own, as a
necessary step towards investigating the Schwinger model when adding a chemical potential.
This setup leads to the infamous sign problem and it would be very reassuring to see whether
the here used MPS and MPO approaches can lead to a successful application for this very
hard problem, which is very diﬃcult, if not impossible to solve by standard Markov chain
Monte Carlo methods.
