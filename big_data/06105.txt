A characterization of nilpotent orbit closures among symplectic singularities

Yoshinori Namikawa

Symplectic singularities have been playing important roles both in algebraic geometry
and geometric representation theory ever since Beauville introduced their notion in [Be].
Most examples of symplectic singularities admit natural C∗-actions with only positive
weights. Kaledin [Ka] conjectured that any symplectic singularity admits such a C∗-
action.

If a symplectic singularity has a C∗-action with positive weights, it can be globalized
to an aﬃne variety with a C∗-action. Such an aﬃne variety is called a conical symplectic
variety. More precisely, an aﬃne normal variety X = Spec R is a conical symplectic
variety if

(i) R is positively graded: R = ⊕i≥0Ri with R0 = C;
(ii) the smooth part Xreg admits a homogeneous symplectic 2-form ω and it extends

to a holomorphic 2-form on a resolution ˜X of X.

Denote the C∗-action by t : X → X (t ∈ C∗). By the assumption we have t∗ω = tlω
for some integer l. This integer l is called the weight of ω and is denoted by wt(ω). By
the extension property (ii) we have wt(ω) > 0 (cf. [Na 3], Lemma (2.2)).

Let {x0, ..., xn} be a set of minimal homogeneous generators of the C-algebra R and
put ai := degxi. We put N := max{a0, ..., an} and call N the maximal weight of X.
It is uniquely determined by a conical symplectic variety X. By [Na 1], there are only
ﬁnitely many conical symplectic varieties (X, ω) of a ﬁxed dimension 2d and with a
ﬁxed maximal weight N, up to an isomorphism. In this sense it would be important
to classify conical symplectic varieties with maximal weight 1. By the homogeneous
generators {xi}, we can embed X into an aﬃne space Cn+1. In [Na 2] we treat the case
where X ⊂ Cn+1 is a complete intersection of homogeneous polynomials. The main
theorem of [Na 2] asserts that (X, ω) is isomorphic to the nilpotent cone (N, ωKK) of
a complex semisimple Lie algebra g together with the Kostant Kirillov 2-form provided
that X is singular. However, there are a lot of examples of maximal weight 1 which
are not of complete intersection. In fact, a nilpotent orbit O of a complex semisimple
Lie algebra g admits the Kostant-Kirillov form ωKK and if its closure ¯O is normal, then
( ¯O, ωKK) is a conical symplectic variety with maximal weight 1 by Panyushev [Pa] and
Hinich [Hi].

A main purpose of this article is to prove that they actually exhaust all conical

symplectic varieties with maximal weight 1.

Theorem. Let (X, ω) be a conical symplectic variety with maximal weight 1. Then

(X, ω) is isomorphic to one of the following:
(i) (C2d, ωst) with ωst = Σ1≤i≤ddzi ∧ dzi+d,
(ii) ( ¯O, ωKK) where ¯O is a nilpotent orbit closure of a complex semisimple Lie algebra

g and ωKK is the Kostant-Kirillov form.

In the remainder, X is a conical symplectic variety with the maximal weight N = 1.
As is noticed in [Na 2], if X is smooth, then (X, ω) is isomorphic to an aﬃne space C2d

1

together with the standard symplectic form ωst. Thus we moreover assume that X is
singular in the remainder. Once we notice that R1 has a natural Lie algebra structure
(Proposition 1), it is fairly easy to show that X is a coadjoint orbit closure of a complex
Lie algebra g (Proposition 3). The key result of this article is Proposition 4, where we
prove that g is semisimple.

Proposition 1 If X is a singular conical symplectic variety with maximal weight

N = 1, then wt(ω) = 1.

Proof. Since N = 1, the coordinate ring R is generated by R1. We put l := wt(ω).
We already know that l > 0. If l > 2, then we have {R1, R1} = 0 and hence {R, R} = 0,
which is absurd. We now assume that l = 2. Then the Poisson bracket induces a skew-
symmetric form R1 × R1 → R0 = C. If this is a degenerate skew-symmetric form, then
we can choose a non-zero element x1 ∈ R1 such that {x1, ·} = 0. Let us consider the
ideal I of R generated by x1. Then I is a Poisson ideal and it determines a closed Poisson
subscheme Y of X with CodimX Y = 1. On the other hand, since X is a symplectic
variety, any closed Poisson subscheme Y of X is contained in the singular locus of X.
In particular, CodimXY ≥ 2. This is a contradiction. Notice that x1 = 0 determines a
non-zero eﬀective divisor D on Xreg. If we choose a general point a ∈ D and consider an
analytic open neighborhood U ⊂ Xreg of a. Then there is a system of local coordinates
{z1, ..., z2d} of U such that x1 can be written as x1 = zm
for a suitable m > 0. The
1
Poisson structure on X induces a non-degenerate Poisson structure {·, ·}U on U. But,
by the choice of x1, we have {zm
1 , ·}U = 0. This contradicts that the Poisson bracket
{·, ·}U is non-degenerate.

Therefore the skew-symmetric form is non-degenerate.

In this case X is a closed
Poisson subscheme of an aﬃne space with a non-degenerate Poisson structure induced by
the standard symplectic form. But such an aﬃne space has no Poisson closed subscheme
except the aﬃne space itself. This is a contradiction. Q.E.D.

By Proposition 1, R1 becomes a Lie algebra by the Poisson bracket. We denote by g
this Lie algebra. As all generators have weight 1, we have a surjection ⊕Symi(R1) → R.
It induces a C∗-equivariant closed embedding X → g∗.

Recall that the adjoint group G of g (cf.

[Pro, p.86]) is deﬁned as a subgroup of
GL(g) generated by all elements of the form exp(ad v) with v ∈ g. The adjoint group G
is a complex Lie subgroup of GL(g), but it is not necessarily a closed algebraic subgroup
of GL(g). Moreover, the Lie algebra Lie(G) does not necessarily coincide with g. We
have Lie(G) = g if and only if the adjoint representation is a faithful g-representation,
or equivalently, g has trivial center.

Proposition 2. Let AutC∗

(X, ω) denote the C∗-equivariant automorphism group
preserving ω. Then the neutral component of AutC∗
(X, ω) can be identiﬁed with the
adjoint group G of g. Moreover g has trivial center. In particular, g is the Lie algebra
of the linear algebraic group AutC∗

(X, ω).

Proof . Let (∧≥1ΘXreg, δ) be the Lichnerowicz-Poisson complex for a Poisson manifold
Xreg (cf. [Na 3, Section 3]). The algebraic torus C∗ acts on Γ(Xreg, ∧pΘXreg ) and there
is an associated grading

Γ(Xreg, ∧pΘXreg) = ⊕n∈Z Γ(Xreg, ∧pΘXreg)(n).

2

Since the Poisson bracket of X has degree −1, the coboudary map δ has degree −1;

thus we have a complex

Γ(Xreg, ΘXreg)(0) δ1→ Γ(Xreg, ∧2ΘXreg)(−1) δ2→ ...

The kernel Ker(δ1) of this complex is isomorphic to the tangent space of AutC∗

(X, ω)
In fact, an element of Ker(δ1) corresponds to a derivation of OXreg (or an
at [id].
inﬁnitesimal automorphism of Xreg) preserving the Poisson structure, but it is uniquely
extends to a derivation of OX preserving the Poisson structure.

The Lichnerowicz-Poisson complex (∧≥1ΘXreg, δ) is identiﬁed with the truncated De
Xreg , d) by the symplectic form ω. The algebraic torus C∗ acts on

Rham complex (Ω≥1
Γ(Xreg, Ωp

Xreg ) and there is an associated grading

Γ(Xreg, Ωp

Xreg ) = ⊕n∈Z Γ(Xreg, Ωp

Xreg )(n).

The coboundary map d has degree 0; thus we have a complex

Γ(Xreg, Ω1

Xreg)(1) d1→ Γ(Xreg, Ω2

Xreg)(1) d2→ ...

Since ω has weight 1, this complex is identiﬁed with the the Lichnerowicz-Poisson com-
plex above.

There is an injective map d : Γ(Xreg, OXreg)(1) → Γ(Xreg, Ω1
We shall prove that Ker(d1) = Γ(Xreg, OXreg)(1). The C∗-action on X deﬁnes a
Xreg)(1), the Lie derivative Lζv of v along ζ

vector ﬁeld ζ on Xreg. For v ∈ Γ(Xreg, Ω1
equals v. If moreover v is d-closed, then one has v = d(iζv) by the Cartan relation

Xreg)(1).

Lζv = d(iζv) + iζ(dv).

This means that v ∈ Γ(Xreg, OXreg)(1). On the other hand, we have Γ(Xreg, OXreg)(1) =
Γ(X, OX)(1) = R1 = g.

It follows from the identiﬁcation of Ker(δ1) and Ker(d1) that every element of Ker(δ1)
is a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld Hf := {f, ·} for some f ∈ R1. In particular, for g ∈ R1,
we have Hf (g) = [f, g]. Since Hf 6= 0 for a non-zero f , the map ad : g → End(g) is an
injection. Notice that both G and AutC∗
(X, ω) are subgroups of GL(g). The tangent
spaces of both subgroups at [id] coincide with g ∼= ad(g) ⊂ End(g). Therefore G is the
neutral component of AutC∗

(X, ω) and Lie(G) = g. Q.E.D.

Proposition 3 The symplectic variety X coincides with the closure of a coadjoint

orbit of g∗.

Proof. We ﬁrst show that X is stable under the coadjoint action. Let I ⊂ ⊕Symi(R1)
be the deﬁning ideal of X in g∗. Since I is a homogeneous ideal, one can write
I = ⊕Ii, where each Ii is a subspace of Symi(R1). We want to prove that Ii is a
G-subrepresentation of Symi(R1). In order to do it, it is enough to show that Ii is a
g-subrepresentation of Symi(R1). But, as I is a Poisson ideal of R, we have [R1, Ii] ⊂ Ii.
This means that Ii is a g-subspace of Symi(R1).

We next show that X is the closure of a coadjoint orbit. Since X is G-stable, it is a
union of G-orbits. The G-orbits in X are symplectic leaves of a Poisson variety X. In

3

our case, since X has only symplectic singularities, X has only ﬁnitely many symplectic
leaves by [Ka]. Therefore X consists of ﬁnite number of G-orbits; hence there is an open
dense G-orbit and X is the closure of the orbit. Q.E.D.

For a complex Lie algebra g, let us denote by n its nilradical. Assume that n 6= 0.
Then the center z(n) of n is also non-trivial. Moreover z(n) is an ideal of g. In fact, it is
enough to prove that, if y ∈ g and z ∈ z(n), then [x, [y, z]] = 0 for any x ∈ n. Consider
the Jacobi identity

[x, [y, z]] + [y, [z, x]] + [z, [x, y]] = 0.

First, since z ∈ z(n), one has [z, x] = 0. Next, since n is an ideal of g, we have [x, y] ∈ n;
hence [z, [x, y]] = 0. It then follows from the Jacobi identity that [x, [y, z]] = 0.

Proposition 4. Let g be a complex Lie algebra with trivial center whose adjoint
group G is a linear algebraic group. Assume that the nilradical n of g is non-trivial. Let
O be a coadoint orbit of g∗ with the following properties

(i) O is preserved by the scalar C∗-action of g∗;
(ii) T0 ¯O = g∗, where T0 ¯O denotes the tangent space of the closure ¯O of O at the

origin.

Then ¯O − O contains inﬁnitely many coadjoint orbits; in particular ¯O has inﬁnitely

many symplectic leaves.

Remark. This proposition shows that ¯O cannot have symplectic singularities. In
fact, if ¯O has symplectic singularities, it has only ﬁnitely many symplectic leaves by [Ka].
Proof of Proposition 4. Since g has trivial center, the nilradical n is the Lie algebra
of the unipotent radical U of G. Then, by a result of Mostow [Mos], we have a decompo-
sition g = l ⊕ n into a reductive Levi factor and the nilradical. Take an element φ ∈ O.
Then φ is a linear function on g, which restricts to a non-zero function on z(n). In fact,
if φ is zero on z(n), then O ⊂ (g/z(n))∗ and hence ¯O ⊂ (g/z(n))∗, which contradicts the
assumption (ii). We put ¯φ := φ|z(n) 6= 0.

Notice that the adjoint group G is the subgroup of GL(g) generated by all elements
of the form exp(ad v) with v ∈ g. If v ∈ z(n), then exp(ad v) = id + ad v because
(ad v)2 = 0 for v ∈ z(n). Let Z(U) be the neutral component of the center of the
unipotent radical U. Then one can write Z(U) = 1 + ad z(n). By the assumption, the
map ad : g → End(g) is an injection. Now we identify z(n) with ad z(n); then one can
write Z(U) = 1 + z(n) and its group law is deﬁned by (1 + v)(1 + v′) := 1 + (v + v′) for
v, v′ ∈ z(n). Fix an element v ∈ z(n) and consider Ad∗

1+v(φ) ∈ g∗. The adjoint action

is deﬁned by

Ad1+v : l ⊕ n → l ⊕ n

x ⊕ y → x ⊕ ([v, x] + y)

because exp(ad v) = id + ad v and (ad v)(y) = 0. By deﬁnition

Ad∗

1+v(φ)(x ⊕ y) = φ(x ⊕ y) + ¯φ([v, x]).

Here notice that [v, x] ∈ z(n) and hence φ([v, x]) = ¯φ([v, x]).

4

Since z(n) is an l-module by the Lie bracket, we decompose it into irreducible factors
z(n) = L Vi. Notice that it is the same as the irreducible decomposition of z(n) as a
[l, l]-module.

When dim Vi = 1 for some i, this Vi is an ideal of g. By the assumption (i), one can
write ¯O = SpecR with a graded C-algebra R = ⊕j≥0Rj. By (ii) we see that R1 = g.
Take a generator x of a 1-dimensional space Vi. Then x generates a Poisson ideal I of R
and Y := Spec(R/I) is a closed Poisson subscheme of ¯O of codimension 1. Moreover, Y
is stable under the G-action. Since dim Y is odd, Y contains inﬁnitely many coadjoint
orbits.

In the remainder we assume that dim Vi > 1 for all i. Since ¯φ 6= 0, we can choose an i
such that φ|Vi 6= 0. We ﬁx a Cartan subalgebra h of the semisimple Lie algebra [l, l] and
choose a set ∆ of simple roots from the root system Φ. We deﬁne n+ := Lα∈Φ+[l, l]α.
Let v0 ∈ Vi be a highest weight vector of the irreducible [l, l]-module Vi. Then one
has [v0, n+] = 0 and, in particular, φ([v0, n+]) = 0. Moreover, we may assume that
¯φ(v0) 6= 0 by replacing φ by a suitable Ad∗
g(φ) with g ∈ L. This is possible. In fact,
g( ¯φ)(v0) = 0 for all g, then ¯φ is zero on the vector subspace of Vi spanned by all
if Ad∗
Adg(v0). But, since Vi is an irreducible L-representation, such a subspace coincides with
Vi. This contradicts the fact that ¯φ|Vi
6= 0. Since v0 is a highest weight vector of a
non-trivial [l, l]-irreducible module Vi, [v0, h] is a multiple of v0 by a non-zero constant
for an h ∈ h. Since ¯φ(v0) 6= 0, we also have ¯φ([v0, h]) 6= 0 for this h ∈ h.

Let us consider ¯φv0 := ¯φ([v0, ·])|[l,l]. By deﬁnition ¯φv0 is an element of [l, l]∗. By the
Killing form it is identiﬁed with an element of [l, l]. The two facts ¯φv0(n+) = 0 and
¯φv0(h) 6= 0 mean that ¯φv0 is not a nilpotent element of [l, l].

For such v0 and φ, we consider Ad∗

1+t−1v0

(tφ), with t ∈ C∗. One can write

Ad∗

1+t−1v0(tφ)(x ⊕ y) = tφ(x ⊕ y) + ¯φ([v0, x]).

Thus one has

Ad∗

1+t−1v0(tφ)(x ⊕ y) = ¯φ([v0, x]).

lim
t→0

By deﬁnition Ad∗
equality above, we see that limt→0 Ad∗
element of (g/n)∗ = l∗.

1+t−1v0

(tφ) ∈ O. Thus limt→0 Ad∗

(tφ) ∈ ¯O. Moreover, by the
(tφ)|n = 0; thus it can be regarded as an

1+t−1v0

1+t−1v0

Furthermore, we have

Ad∗

1+t−1v0(tφ)|[l,l] = ¯φv0,

lim
t→0

which can be regarded as an element of [l, l] by the identiﬁcation [l, l]∗ ∼= [l, l]. As
remarked above, this is not a nilpotent element.

The reductive Lie algebra l is written as a direct sum of the semi-simple part and the
center: l = [l, l] ⊕ z(l). There is an L-equivariant isomorphism l∗ ∼= [l, l]∗ ⊕ z(l)∗. Here L
acts trivially on the second factor z(l)∗. Therefore, every coadjoint orbit of l∗ is a pair
of a coadjoint orbit of [l, l]∗ and an element of z(l).

In our situation, we can write

¯φ([v0, ·]) = ¯φv0 ⊕ ¯φ([v0, ·])|z(l).

5

We can apply the same argument for λφ with an arbitrary λ ∈ C∗ to conclude that

λ ¯φ([v0, ·]) ∈ ¯O. One can write

λ · ¯φ([v0, ·) = λ ¯φv0 ⊕ λ · ¯φ([v0, ·])|z(l).

Since ¯φv0 is not an nilpotent element, we see that λ ¯φv0 (λ ∈ C∗) are contained in

mutually diﬀerent coadjoint orbits of [l, l]∗.

Therefore, λ · ¯φ([v0, ·]) (λ ∈ C∗) are also contained in mutually diﬀerent coadjoint

orbits of l∗. Q.E.D.

Proof of Theorem. We already know that if X is smooth, then (X, ω) is isomorphic
to (C2d, ωst) ([Na 2]). So we assume that X is singular. By Propositions 2, 3 and 4,
(X, ω) is isomorphic to a coadjoint orbit closure ( ¯O, ωKK) of a complex reductive Lie
algebra g together with the Kostant-Kirillov form. Assume that g is not semisimple,
i.e., g has non-trivial center z(g). In our case O is preserved by the scalar C∗-action of
g∗. Such an orbit is contained in (g/z(g))∗. This contradicts the fact that T0 ¯O = g∗.
Hence g is semisimple. For a semisimple Lie algebra, a coadjoint orbit is identiﬁed with
an adjoint orbit by the Killing form. A coadjoint orbit preserved by the scalar C∗-action
corresponds to a nilpotent orbit by this identiﬁcation.
