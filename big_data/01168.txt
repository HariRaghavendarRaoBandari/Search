Abstract

Avalanche control by explosion is a widely applied method to minimize the
avalanche risk to infrastructure in snow-covered mountain areas. However, the
mechanisms involved leading from an explosion to the release of an avalanche
are not well understood. Here we test the hypothesis that weak layers fail due
to the stress caused by propagating acoustic waves. The underlying mechanism
is that the stress induced by the acoustic waves exceeds the strength of the snow
layers. We compare ﬁeld measurements to a numerical simulation of acoustic
wave propagation in a porous material. The simulation consists of an acoustic
domain for the air above the snowpack and a poroelastic domain for the dry
snowpack. The two domains are connected by a wave ﬁeld decomposition and
open pore boundary conditions. Empirical relations are used to derive a porous
model of the snowpack from density proﬁles of the ﬁeld experiment. Biot’s
equations are solved in the poroelastic domain to obtain simulated accelerations
in the snowpack and a time dependent stress ﬁeld. Locations of snow failure
were identiﬁed by comparing the principal normal and shear stress ﬁelds to snow
strength which is assumed to be a function of snow porosity. One air pressure
measurement above the snowpack was used to calibrate the pressure amplitude
of the source in the simulation. Additional ﬁeld measurements of air pressure
and acceleration measurements inside the snowpack were compared to individual
ﬁeld variables of the simulation. The acceleration of the air ﬂowing inside the
pore space of the snowpack was identiﬁed to have the highest correlation to the
acceleration measurements in the snowpack.

1. Introduction

During the last decades the number of people living and recreating in, or
travelling through mountainous terrain has substantially increased. To ensure
the reliability of infrastructure extensive engineering works such as supporting
structures and snow sheds have been built to prevent damages due to large
avalanches. Whereas these permanent protection measures are highly eﬀective,
they are also costly. Therefore, less expensive temporary preventive measures
have become increasingly popular over the last decade. In particular, artiﬁcial
avalanche release by explosion is among the key preventive measures. The aim
is to trigger avalanches when their size is still small enough to not cause any
damage and no people are exposed in the path of the avalanche [24].

Releasing avalanches with explosives by hand or helicopter charging is, how-
ever, limited to locations or weather conditions allowing tolerably save access
for avalanche control personnel. This limitation has been overcome by ﬁxed
avalanche control installations which trigger avalanches by the eﬀect of explo-
sions and allow remote operation even under most adverse weather conditions
or during nighttime. The basic physical mechanisms that cause slab avalanches
to release from explosives, and other causes, are well known and have been used
to choose optimal locations of blast installations for years. What is lacking is a
quantitative model incorporating the “known” physics associated with initiating
failure of slab avalanches that can be used to examine the processes, improve
understanding of the physical processes and make predictions that can be tested
in the future.

Historically, research on avalanche control has been focused on experimen-
tal evidence of waveforms, charge type and placement to support the work of
avalanche control operations [17, 25, 39, 6, 3]. The most extensive measuring
campaigns were performed by Gubler [18]. However, many of the more recent
studies focused on small range eﬀects [6, 40, 22]. A more detailed review of the
past research within snow and explosions is given by Simioni et al. [35]. A model
considering the porous character of snow based on Biot’s [1962] equations has
been proposed by Johnson [21], but has rarely been applied to snow since [2].
A mixed stress-energy failure criterion including simpliﬁed eﬀects of explosive
loading was developed by Chiaia et al. [9]. It is only recently that numerical
tools are used to support a theoretical framework on the physical mechanisms
that lead to the release of an avalanche. Miller et al. [27] considered the non-
linear eﬀects of an explosion and non-linear compaction of the snowpack for
close ranges using the ﬁnite element method.

Here we compare the measurements from ﬁeld experiments on the wave
propagation caused by an explosion to the results of a numerical simulation
considering the porous character of snow. We tested the hypothesis that the
stresses induced by the acoustic wave propagating through the snowpack locally
exceed the snow strength and lead to failure. In the winter 2013-2014 we per-
formed multiple ﬁeld experiments with avalanche control explosives triggered at
diﬀerent elevations above the snow surface and measured the air pressure above
the snowpack as well as acceleration at diﬀerent depths within the snowpack

and distances from the point of explosion [35]. In addition, we recorded weak
layer failure with cameras.

In the following we describe the numerical model that was used to perform
the simulations. We focus on a speciﬁc experiment as a showcase for the test
series, build a layered porous model for the prevailing snowpack, and evaluate
the numerical results toward measured air pressure and acceleration. Finally,
we compare locations where the stress in the numerical simulation exceeds the
strength of the snowpack to the observed locations in the ﬁeld.

2. Methods

2.1. Field experiment

We chose the ﬁrst experiment from a day with eight experiments on 27.
February, 2015 as a showcase to compare with the numerical results. The ge-
ometry of the experiment is shown in Figure 1. A 4.3 kg explosive charge was
taped to a wood stick and placed 1 m above the snow surface. Three snow pits
were excavated 12.3 m, 17.3 m, and 22.5 m horizontal distance from the point
of the explosive charge. Microphones were placed 0.05 m above the undisturbed
snow surface next to the snow pits. Three accelerometers were installed in cav-
ities at 0.13 m, 0.48 m, and 0.83 m below the snow surface in each snow pit[35].
Special care was given to ﬁt the diameters of the horizontal holes exactly with
the diameters of the accelerometers to warrant the coupling of the sensors to the
snowpack. Snowpack failure was recorded with compact cameras [35] The snow-
pack on the investigated day was 187 cm deep and consisted of a 45 cm thick
layer of recently deposited snow (consisting of decomposing and fragmented pre-
cipitation particles) including two melt-freeze crusts above a well-consolidated
base. The base was composed of layers of small rounded grains interspersed
with several melt-freeze crusts and ice layers above hard layers of faceted crys-
tals near the bottom of the snowpack. A potential weak layer was identiﬁed at
a height of 85 cm from the ground. The snowpack was still dry but relatively
warm with a minimum temperature of -1◦C. The point snow stability based on

the snow proﬁle was rated as good [30]. An extended column test [34] indicated
that the potential weak layer was very hard to trigger as it was buried below a
1 m thick well consolidated slab. The densities obtained by capacitive measure-
ments in the three snow pits are shown in Figure 2 [11, 14]. To localize weak
layer failure during the experiments, compact cameras were installed in each
snow pit and recorded the pit wall during the explosion. The single video stills
allowed to visually identify weak layer failure due to movement of the snowpack
overlaying the weak layer [35].

2.2. Numerical model

Seasonal snow is a highly porous material with air often taking up the larger
part of the volume. Johnson [21] showed that Biot’s [1956] theory for wave
propagation in porous materials can be successfully applied to snow. Acoustic
wave propagation in such porous materials is characterized by the presence of
a compressional and a shear wave in the ice skeleton and an additional second
compressional wave that is propagating in the pore ﬂuid that is also called the
“slow” wave. Due to the high porosity and the proportions between material
properties this second compressional wave mode is propagating in snow [28, 19]
and can be recorded. This stands in contrast to other natural porous materials
as, for example, sediments where the wave is diﬀusive and cannot be recorded.
The energy dissipation mechanism in Biot’s theory is physically modeled by the

propagate through the material. Biot’s model also accounts for the interaction
between waves propagating in the porous frame and in the pore space of the
material.

To simulate acoustic wave propagation in snow we use a pseudo-spectral
approach which is known to be accurate and eﬃcient [7]. We use the algorithm of
Sidler et al. [33] where the simulation consists of an upper acoustic domain that
is connected to a poroelastic domain by a wave ﬁeld decomposition to account
for the boundary conditions at the interface [16, 8, 37]. For this study, the
acoustic domain represents the air above the snowpack and the lower domain,
where Biot’s [1962] diﬀerential equations are solved, represents the snowpack.

Interfaces of porous materials are not uniquely deﬁned and have one degree
of freedom that can be interpreted as the connection between the pore space
[12]. The connectivity of the pore space is expressed with the so called surface
ﬂow impedance that is zero for open pores and inﬁnite for closed pore interfaces.
For natural occurring materials the pore space is mostly connected and open
pore boundary conditions apply. However, a coating on the surface, a deposit in
the pore space or a mismatch of the pore throats between two porous materials
or layers with diﬀerent characteristics can lead to decreased connectivity. For
the snow surface we assume open-pore type boundary conditions, where the air
in the pore space is fully connected to the air above the snowpack and the pore
spaces of adjacent layers are fully connected.

The snowpack is considered two-dimensional in the model. The total size of
the acoustic domain is 29 m in horizontal direction by 20 m in vertical direc-
tion. The poroelastic domain has the same length in horizontal direction, but
is only 3.5 m in vertical direction. The acoustic domain of the model consists of
185 grid nodes in vertical direction and 725 grid nodes in horizontal direction.
The poroelastic domain has the same number of grid nodes in the horizontal
direction and 147 grid nodes in vertical direction. Due to the use of a Fourier
operator the grid nodes are equally spaced at 0.04 m in horizontal direction.
In vertical direction the spacing is irregular due to the Gauss-Lobatto points of
the Chebyshev operator and a consequent grid stretching [38, 29]. Close to the
interface the grid nodes are more densely spaced but almost regularly spaced at
0.04 m throughout most of the porous domain.
The source was placed 4 m from the left boundary of the domain 1 m above
the snow-air interface. A total of 5.6× 105 time steps with a length of 2× 10−7 s
were computed, which corresponds to a total length of 0.112 s for the entire
simulation.

A limitation in the presented simulation is that the non linear eﬀects present
in the vicinity of the explosion are not considered. These non-linear eﬀects are
believed to no longer be of relevance at the distances considered in this study. As
the simulation also models the early part of the experiment some adjustments
of the results of the simulation are necessary. The most signiﬁcant adjustments
and limitations of this simulation are:

i To account for the supersonic wave velocity of the shock wave in the vicinity

5

of the explosion we have adjusted the timing of the simulation to the mea-
surements of the arrival of the direct air wave at the pressure receiver in the
air closest to the explosion.

ii To account for the unknown pressure amplitude at the point of the explosion
we have scaled the the entire simulation to the pressure of the direct air wave
measured at the closest pressure sensor in the air. This is appropriate as
the applied simulation is based on linear equations. The relative amplitude
of ﬁeld variables in the simulation does not depend on the amplitude of
the source. Therefore it is possible to compute a simulation with a random
source amplitude and scale the entire simulation with the actual pressure of
the source or with a measurement of any of the ﬁeld variables at any location
in the simulation.

iii To account for the unknown source waveform and changes in the waveform
due to non-linear eﬀects we have chosen the Friedlander wavelet as the source
waveform. This is the simplest form to express a blast wave [15].

iv To account for the eﬀects of coupling between the acceleration of the pore
ﬂuid (air inside the snowpack) and the accelerometers we have used a simple
scaling of the simulated ﬂuid acceleration by a scaling factor.

v The simulation does not make any adjustments at locations where snow

failure is predicted.

2.3. Snowpack model

Ten properties of the porous material are required to solve Biot’s equations.
The ice skeleton of the snow is deﬁned by the bulk modulus of the frame material
Ks, the bulk modulus of the matrix Km, and the shear modulus µs. The pore
ﬂuid is characterized by the ﬂuid bulk modulus Kf and the viscosity η of the
pore ﬂuid. Additionally, the densities of the solid and ﬂuid materials ρs and ρf
have to be known. The geometry of the pore space is deﬁned by the porosity φ,
the permeability κ, and the tortuosity T . It is often not possible to measure all
these properties at the required spatial resolution. However, the properties of
snow are interrelated and a priori information, geometrical considerations, and
empirical relationships can be used to estimate unknown snow properties from
snow porosity or density [32]. The relations to obtain the porous properties of
snow from its porosity are summarized in Table 1.

The density proﬁles in the three snow pits show a spatially uniform distri-
bution of the snowpack and we use a horizontally layered snowpack model for
the simulation. Our density model is based on the density proﬁle from the snow
pit at 22 m horizontal distance from the explosion labeled X3 in Figure 2 and
is shown in Figure 3. A porosity model is obtained from this density model by
assuming that the pore space is completely ﬁlled with air in dry snow. Based on
the porosity model the remaining properties for the porous model are derived
according to the relations shown in Table 1.

2.4. Source characterization

The strong overpressure originating from an explosion leads to non-linear ef-
fects that are not covered by our numerical simulation. For such high pressures,
the bulk modulus of the air is a function of the pressure amplitude and the
temperature diﬀerence before and after the shock front [10]. The higher bulk
modulus of air under higher pressure and temperature leads to shock waves
propagating faster than sound waves. Moreover, as parts of the waveform with
higher amplitude propagate faster than those with lower amplitude the wave
front steepens up during propagation. When the shockwave is reﬂected at the
interface between the air and the snowpack the incident and the reﬂected wave
have positive interference and consequently a higher velocity in the vicinity of
the interface that can lead to the formation of a so called “mach stem” [23].

However, these eﬀects are present only in the vicinity of the snowpack. The
air pressure is supposed to decay due to non adiabatic eﬀects and geometrical
spreading. Therefore, at larger distances from the point of explosion, linear
equations can be used to predict wave propagation. Using an elastic approach,
it is not possible to characterize the amplitude and waveform from the energy
content and the type of chemical reaction of the explosive. Instead, the waveform
is estimated from pressure recordings to be of the form of a Friedlander wavelet,
which is widely used for this purpose. This waveform is then scaled to ﬁt the
recorded pressure at the microphone that was placed at 12.3 m distance from
the point of explosion. A similar approach was used by Albert et al. [2] who
also used the recording of a receiver to characterize the waveform of the elastic
equivalent source. The Friedlander wavelet and its frequency content used in
the numerical simulation are shown in Figure 4.

2.5. Simulated snow failure locations

To evaluate the locations where the propagating wave ﬁeld leads to a failure
of the snowpack we compare the stress ﬁeld of the numerical simulation to the
compressional and shear strength of snow.
In general, the nature of failure
depends on the loading conditions. For brittle failure, Mellor [26] suggested to
use a fraction of the snow’s Young’s modulus to deﬁne the maximum stress snow

et al. [31] are shown.

may withstand before it starts to fail. Here we use a fraction of 1 × 10−3 of the
bulk modulus and a fraction of 0.5 × 10−3 of the shear modulus to deﬁne the
strength. The corresponding shear and compressional strength as a function of
porosity based on these fractions and the relationships from Table 1 are shown
in Figure 5 and are compared to the compilation of snow strength measurements
presented by Mellor [26] and Shapiro et al. [31].

The absolute values of the ﬁeld variables were scaled to ﬁt the pressure
recording of the microphone at a horizontal distance of 12.3 m from the point of
the explosion to evaluate the snow failure locations in the numerical simulation.
As the underlying equations are linear the scaling of the simulation can be
performed by a simple multiplication with a scaling factor. The factor itself
depends on the amplitude of the source in the simulation and can be randomly
chosen.

The maximum principal normal and shear stresses for all grid nodes in the
simulation are computed from snapshots of the stress tensor every 0.4 ms for
the whole length of the simulation. The maximum principal normal stress σpn
and the principal shear stress τp can be obtained from the stress tensor σ as

and

where the ﬁrst indices x and y indicate a plane normal to the corresponding
coordinate axis and the second indices denotes the direction in which the stress
acts [20].

The individual snapshots are then evaluated for locations where principal
normal and shear stresses exceed the maximum strength of the snow model.
These maximum strengths are computed from the porosity model. Based on

9

the porosity model matrix the bulk and the shear moduli for all grid nodes are
computed using the equations shown in Table 1. Locations where the simulated
stresses have exceeded the computed strengths of the snowpack in one or more
snapshots are considered locations of snow failure.

3. Results

3.1. Air pressure

The air pressure measurements above the snow surface and corresponding
frequency spectra are shown in Figure 6 and compared to the corresponding
results of the numerical simulation. As the equations in the simulation are
2D a correction accounting for the diﬀerences between cylindrical and spherical
spreading is applied for accuracy and completeness. In the 2D simulation the
√
waves propagate cylindrically from the point of explosion and the amplitude
r, but in the ﬁeld measurements the source is a
decays proportional to 1/
point source which shows a spherical amplitude decay proportional to 1/r [1].
The diﬀerences resulting from this processing step are rather small because of
the relatively large distance from the source which leads to a small curvature of
the waves. The diﬀerences are shown in Figure 6a). The simulated air pressure
is shown in red while the air pressure corrected for spherical spreading is shown
in blue. Omitting this step would not lead to any diﬀerent conclusions for this
study.

The length of a typical signal is around 40 ms and the main frequency content
is between 20 Hz and 70 Hz. The two receivers at larger distances from the point
of the explosion show a stronger decrease of frequencies between ∼ 50 Hz and
150 Hz than the one closest to the point of explosion. Experiments with similar
charge sizes and elevations of the point of explosion show very similar pressure
wave forms and amplitudes.

3.2. Acceleration in the snowpack

Simulated vertical acceleration of the ice skeleton 0.13 m, 0.48 m, and 0.83 m
below the snow surface at a horizontal distance of 17.3 m from the explosion
are compared to the measured acceleration at the same locations in Figure 7.
The measured accelerations show a strong peak of acceleration at about 39 ms.
This is approximately the same time as the air pressure wave arrives at the
pressure sensor in the air above the snowpack. However, before the strong
peak smaller peaks and negative acceleration are present in the ﬁeld recordings.
The simulated ice matrix acceleration shows small peaks of arriving wave fronts
beginning approximately 15 ms after the triggering of the explosion. This earlier
arrival corresponds to the fact that the acoustic wave speeds in the snowpack
is higher than the wave speed in the air. Yet, the prominent recorded peak at
39 ms is considerably smaller in the simulated matrix acceleration. Subsequent
arriving wave modes have a similar amplitude in the simulation and in the ﬁeld
measurements.

Figures 8, 9, and 10 for horizontal distances of 12.3 m, 17.3 m, and 22.5 m from
the point of the explosion, respectively. Here, the prominent peak in the mea-
sured acceleration corresponds to the simulated air pressure wave propagating
through the pore space of the snow pack. As the arrival times in the ice matrix
responds well with the expected wave speeds in the snowpack we think that the
response of the ice matrix is superimposed by the stronger response of the pore
ﬂuid.

From the recording time of the modeled seismograms 11.7 ms is subtracted
to account for the higher air wave velocities due to non-linear eﬀects in the
vicinity of the explosion. The numerically simulated accelerations shown in
Figures 7, 8, 9, and 10 were scaled with a factor 10−2 (-40 dB). This scaling
factor reproduces the coupling eﬀect well for the receivers located 0.13 m and
0.48 m below the snow surface. For the receivers at a depth of 0.83 m below the
snow surface the scaling factor is 10−1 (-20 dB). A part of this lower amplitude of
the measured seismograms compared to the simulated particle acceleration can
be explained with the higher inertia of the receiver compared to an air particle.
In the simulation the stresses at the receiver locations act on an air particle with
a much lower mass than that of a physical receiver. The resulting acceleration
from this stress will therefore be higher than the measured acceleration. As
stresses are applied to the receiver from both, the ice skeleton and the air in the
pore space the response of the receiver will actually be a complex combination of
the stress ﬁeld, snow porosity, bulk modulus and density of the foam surrounding
the receiver, and how well the foam is coupled to the ice skeleton. A method
to estimate the coupling of a receiver to a visco-elastic ocean bottom, which
represents a somewhat similar situation, has been shown by Sutton et al. [36].
Vertical accelerations decrease rapidly with depth at all distances from the
point of explosion. This eﬀect can be explained with the strong attenuation for
the second compressional wave. For the receiver 0.83 m below the snow surface
it is not exactly clear whether the lower scaling factor is due to an increased
coupling between snow and receiver or if the lower amplitude of the simulation
is due to the snowpack properties in the model. It is save to say that predictions
for wave propagating in the pore ﬂuid are better higher in the snowpack as less
layers are involved. However, the most plausible explanation is better coupling
to the ice matrix due to the lower porosity as an overestimated attenuation
would also lead to strong dispersion for the second compressional wave [21, 32].
Such a dispersion can not be seen in the receivers at a depth of 0.83 m below
the snow surface.

Generally it can be observed that the wave ﬁeld in the snowpack is complex
and can not well be described by identifying individual wave modes. This is due
to the interaction of the propagating waves with the many interfaces present in
the simulation. On every interface waves are reﬂected, transmitted and con-
verted into all supported wave modes. The proportions of the waves that get
reﬂected, transmitted and converted depends on the material properties of of
the involved snow layers and the incidence angles. Moreover if the wavelengths
are longer than the involved layers the reﬂection, transmission and conversion

originates from a combination of the snow layers ‘sensed’ by the wave. In a di-
rect numerical method where the wave ﬁeld is evaluated on discrete grid points
such as we use here these considerations are implicitly resolved by solving the
underlying diﬀerential equations for the ﬁeld variables. Here, these ﬁeld vari-
ables are the horizontal and vertical matrix velocities, the relative horizontal
and vertical pore ﬂuid velocities, the horizontal and vertical stresses in the ice
matrix, the shear stress in the ice matrix and the pore ﬂuid pressure.

As a consequence of the complex wave ﬁled the shear and compressional
stresses are diﬃcult to observe in ﬁeld measurements. In the simulation on the
contrary all ﬁeld variables can be evaluated individually and in combination with
the ﬁeld measurements it is possible to identify which ﬁeld variables contribute
to the recording.

3.3. Snow failure

On the investigated test day, eight experiments were performed. The charge
sizes and charge elevation above the snow surface for the eight experiments
are shown in Table 2. Failure was observed mainly in the upper 30 cm of the
snowpack and at the weak layer at at a depth of about ∼1 m below the snow
surface. Failures even deeper in the snowpack occurred with either very large
charges or close to the point of the explosion. For some experiments, failure
could not be observed at the close pit locations but only in the furthest pit. We
assume that there was failure in the closer pits too, but could not be identiﬁed
by analyzing the recorded video images. Figure 11 shows the locations of the
observed and simulated snow failure. Observed failed layers are indicated in the
ﬁgure with black horizontal lines. The number at the right end of line indicates
the number of the experiment in which the layer failed. In the ﬁeld experiments
the snow failure locations were only evaluated in the snow pits. If a snow pit
showed layer failure at a speciﬁc depth it was assumed that this layer had also
failed closer to the point of the explosion. The points of failure obtained from
the numerical simulation are indicated by red dots. Each red dot represents a
grid point where the principal stress has exceeded the computed strength of the

One of the evaluated snapshots after 30 ms simulation time is shown in
Figure 12. In the upper acoustic domain, the air pressure wave can be seen as
a red front at 14.5 m from the left boundary of the simulation. Principal shear
stresses are shown in the lower poroelastic domain with blue and white color.
Locations where the principal shear stress exceeded the shear strength of the
snowpack during the past 30 ms of the simulation are indicated with dark red
color in the lower domain.

4. Discussion

4.1. Air pressure above the snow surface

The air pressure measurements of the simulation ﬁt the measurements of
the experiments if the amplitude is corrected for the geometrical spreading of a
point source. Such a correction is straightforward for the pressure recordings,

where the wave travels in a relatively straight path through a homogeneous
medium. Such a correction is more diﬃcult for the recordings in the snowpack,
where the waves are reﬂected and follow a complicated path between snow
layers. Therefore, the measurements in the snowpack are not corrected for
geometrical spreading and it can be assumed that the simulated wave ﬁeld is
slightly overestimating the amplitudes in the snowpack.

The time delay for the arrival of the air wave in the simulation and the higher
than expected velocity for the speed of sound are presumably due to non-linear
eﬀects in the propagation of pressure waves originating from explosions [35].
Close to an explosion the particle displacement is large enough that stresses are
not linearly related to the strain as in Hook’s law. In air, large strains yield
faster propagating waves than smaller strains and the waveform tends to acquire
a steep front. The overpressure of the explosion propagates faster than the speed
of sound in the form of a shockwave. The numerical simulation of the experiment
does not take into account these non linear eﬀects. However, at larger distances,
where the particle displacement becomes smaller due to geometrical spreading,
internal friction, and heat dissipation, the pressure wave caused by the explosion
propagates in an elastic fashion. The change of waveform due to the nonlinear
eﬀects can be taken into account by adequately choosing the shape of the source
waveform [e.g., 13]. For example, as we did here, by choosing a Friedlander
source wavelet.

The speed of sound, derived from the wave arrival time at the microphones
and their distance, is around 350 m/s for the ﬁeld experiment, which is higher
than the expected 330 m/s for this temperature [35]. The theoretical shockwave
speed vshock for the measured overpressure at 12.3 m from the explosion can be

19

caculated as

(cid:114) p2 − p1

υ1 − υ2

,

vshock = υ

(3)

where p is the pressure and υ = 1/ρ is the speciﬁc volume [20, p. 363]. The
subscripts 1 and 2 correspond to the regions in front of and behind the shock-
wave, respectively. For air, the ideal gas law can be used to obtain the density
ρ from the air pressure and temperature as

ρ =

p

RspecT

,

(4)

where T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin and Rspec = 287.058 J kg−1K−1 is
the speciﬁc gas constant for dry air. The measured maximum air pressure at the
∼= 84 kPa
microphone was ∼10 kPa in excess of the atmospheric pressure of p1
at the elevation of the study site. This pressure diﬀerence alone does not explain
a shockwave that is propagating faster than the speed of sound. The observed
velocity can be explained also with an increase of air temperature behind the
wave front. To obtain the observed speed of ∼350 m/s the air temperature
behind the shockwave has to be 9 ◦C higher than in front of the shockwave.

4.2. Acceleration in the snowpack

The measured acceleration corresponds much better with the simulated ac-
celeration of the pore ﬂuid than with the simulated acceleration of the ice matrix.
This is a rather surprising result as intuitively one would expect that the ac-
celerometers are coupled mainly to the ice skeleton of the snow. However, given
that the porosity of the snow is usually higher than 0.5 the volume around the
receiver mainly consists of air.
It makes therefore sense to assume that the
motion of the air around the receiver is represented in the recordings.

The introduction of non physically based scaling factors is admittedly a
ﬂaw in the modeling process. However, the fact that a single scaling factor
can reproduce the amplitude of most of the acceleration recordings so well is
a strong indication that there is indeed some kind of coupling process involved
between the snow and the accelerometers.

The acceleration of the pore ﬂuid in the simulation is almost an order of
magnitude higher than the acceleration of the skeleton. Due to the open pore
boundary conditions and the high porosity at the snow surface the air pressure
from the blast wave is transmitted mostly to the pore space and only to a lesser
extent to the ice skeleton of the snow. This wave propagating in the pore space
of a porous material is sometimes also called the ’slow’ wave which is of high
interest in hydrogeophysics and hydro carbon exploration as it directly connects
hydrological properties of the porous materials to seismic wave propagation.
Unlike in snow, the slow wave is a diﬀusive wave mode in these environments
and cannot be directly measured.

It is not clear why the simulated accelerations are higher than the measured
accelerations. There are several mechanism that can potentially contribute to
such a discrepancy. Complete coupling between the snow and the accelerometers

20

may not be provided. Also, the coupling of the accelerometers is complicated
due to the porous nature of the snowpack. The receiver is not only embedded
in a solid material but in a combination of a ﬂuid and a solid material. Due to
the high porosity of the snow the receiver is actually mainly surrounded by air.
The stiﬀer ice frame will, however, have a better coupling to the receiver than
the pore ﬂuid. Due to diﬀerences of the density between the air in the snowpack
and the receiver the stresses applied to the receivers lead to accelerations that
are diﬀerent from the accelerations that would arise when the stresses would be
applied to snow.

4.3. Snow failure

The simulated failure locations shown in Figure 11 suggest that snow failure
is caused in shear rather than compression or tension. This ﬁnding may be
one of the reasons why explosives triggered above the snow surface are more
eﬀective in triggering avalanches than charges that are deployed within the
snowpack. Explosive charges produce almost exclusively compressional waves.
Yet, when the charge is placed above the snow surface the compressional waves
are converted at the snow surface into all existing wave modes which are, in this
case, the ﬁrst and second compressional waves, the shear wave, a reﬂected wave
in the air above the snowpack and a surface wave within the snowpack.
The snow model features a relatively sharp increase in density at a depth of
∼0.5 m. Wave amplitudes and snow failure below this interface are considerably
smaller (Figure 11 and Fig. 12) due to the large diﬀerence in impedance and
the resulting reﬂectance of incident waves. The same observation is also true for
the ﬁeld measurements with the exception of a failure at 0.6 m and 1 m below
the snow surface. Although the layer at 0.6 m only failed with a considerably
larger charge and at 1 m depth a weak layer existed that might have favored
crack propagation from a failure location closer to the point of explosion.

This study is in many aspects complementary to the study of Miller et al.
[27]. While here we are missing the non-linear eﬀects, the explicit source char-
acterization, and the deformation of the snowpack in the immediate vicinity
of the explosion we account for the porous nature of the snowpack and linear
wave propagation at distances up to several tens of meters. The comparison of
the simulated with the measured accelerations shown in this study reveal the
importance of the porous nature of the snowpack. Most of the recorded signal
coincides with the particle movement in the air and not with the ice skeleton of
the snowpack. The porosity of the snowpack not only aﬀects wave propagation
inside the snowpack but also reﬂection and transmission of energy at the inter-
face between the snowpack and the air above the snowpack. In a highly porous
material as snow a large fraction of the transmitted energy is converted into the
second compressional wave that is propagating in the air of the snowpack and
is strongly attenuated. Neglecting the porous nature of the interface will con-
sequently lead to overestimating of the energy propagating in the ice skeleton
of the snow.

5. Conclusions

We have compared ﬁeld measurements of air pressure and accelerations
within the snowpack caused by the detonation of an explosive charge over a
horizontal snowpack to a numerical simulation of an acoustic source over a Biot-
type porous material. The properties of snow as a porous material were derived
from density proﬁles by using a priori information and empirical relationships.
The interface between the air and the porous material in the simulation was con-
sidered to be of the open-pore type. The non-linear eﬀects in the vicinity of the
explosion were considered by using a Friedlander wave form for the source that
was calibrated by the closest measurement of air pressure above the snowpack.
The ﬁeld measurements consisted of air pressure measurements 0.05 m above
the snow surface and acceleration measurements in the snowpack. Accelerom-
eters were installed at three snowpits to measure snowpack accelerations.
In
each snow pit the acceleration was measured at depths of 0.13 m, 0.48 m, and
0.83 m below the snow surface. Regularly spaced markers were placed on the
pit walls in the three pits and were monitored with video cameras during the
experiments. From the video images the failure locations were determined by
visual inspection.

The best ﬁt of the amplitudes of the air pressure measurements was obtained
when the air pressure in the simulation was corrected for the spherical spreading
of a point source. The acceleration recordings in the snowpack ﬁtted the mod-
elled acceleration of the air moving inside the snowpack well. The simulated ice
accelerations are missing the characteristic peak acceleration that is speciﬁc to
the measured accelerations. This ﬁnding suggests that waves propagating the
pore space, i.e. in the air, signiﬁcantly contribute to wave propagation in snow
due to an explosion. Such waves can be simulated by porous models only and
are not considered in the standard elastic or viscoelastic seismological models.
Snow failure locations in the simulation were evaluated by comparing the
principal normal and shear stresses to snow strength. Snow strength was con-
sidered to be a fraction of the bulk or shear modulus of the snow and was derived
from the porosity model of the simulation. Snapshots of the principal normal
and shear stresses for every 0.4 ms of the simulation were then evaluated for
locations were the stresses exceeded the local strength of the snow. The simula-
tion results suggest that observed failures were mainly due to loading by shear
stress.
