ON CONNECTED LIE GROUPS AND
THE APPROXIMATION PROPERTY

SØREN KNUDBY

ABSTRACT. Recently, a complete characterization of connected Lie groups with the Ap-
proximation Property was given. The proof used the newly introduced property (T∗). We
present here a short proof of the same result avoiding the use of property (T∗). Using
property (T∗), however, the characterization is extended to every almost connected group.
We end with some remarks about the impossibility of going beyond the almost connected
case.

The Fourier algebra A(G) of a locally compact group G was introduced by Eymard [5]
and can be deﬁned as the coefﬁent space of the left regular representation of G on L2(G),

A(G) = {f ∗eg | f, g ∈ L2(G)},

whereeg(x) = g(x−1). One can identify A(G) with the predual of the group von Neumann

algebra associated with the left regular representation. A multiplier ϕ of A(G) is called
completely bounded if its transposed operator Mϕ is a completely bounded operator on the
group von Neumann algebra. The completely bounded multiplier norm of ϕ is deﬁned as

kϕkM0A = kMϕkcb.

The space of completely bounded multipliers is dentoed M0A(G). One has an inclusion
A(G) ⊆ M0A(G). It was shown in [4, Proposition 1.10] that the space M0A(G) has a
predual obtained as the completion of L1(G) in the norm

kf kM0A(G)∗ = sup(cid:26)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

ZG

f (x)ϕ(x) dx(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) : ϕ ∈ M0A(G), kϕkM0A ≤ 1(cid:27) .

Remark 1. In general, M0A(G) does not have a unique predual nor a unique weak∗
topology. The predual always refers to the one constructed explicitly above, and the weak∗
topology on M0A(G) is the weak∗ topology coming from this explicit predual.

Following Haagerup and Kraus [9], a locally compact group G has the Approximation
Property (short: AP) if there exists a net in A(G) converging to 1 in the weak∗ topology
of M0A(G). Haagerup and Kraus showed that many groups have this property, e.g., all
weakly amenable groups. This includes solvable groups, compact groups, and simple Lie
groups of real rank one [3, 10]. They showed moreover that the AP is preserved by passing
to closed subgroups and preserved under group extensions (as opposed to weak amenabil-
ity). It is also well-known (and routine to verify) that if K is a compact normal subgroup
in G, then G has the AP if and only if G/K has the AP. We refer to [3, 4, 9] for details on
completely bounded multipliers and the AP.

Haagerup and Kraus conjectured that the group SL(3, R) does not have the AP, but the
conjecture was settled only much later by Lafforgue and de la Salle [11]. Not long after,
Haagerup and de Laat showed more generally that any simple Lie group of real rank at
least two does not have the AP [6, 7]. Finally, a complete characterization of connected
Lie groups with the AP was given in [8] (see also Theorem 2 below). The proof in [8]
involved among other things the property (T∗), introduced in [8]. We give below a much
shorter proof of the characterization of connected Lie groups with the AP that avoids the
use of property (T∗).
To state the characterization of connected Lie groups with the AP, we ﬁrst recall the Levi
decomposition of such a group (see [15, Section 3.18] for details). For a connected Lie
group G, one can decompose its Lie algebra g as g = r ⋊ s, where r is the solvable radical
and s is a semisimple subalgebra. One can further decompose s = s1 ⊕· · ·⊕ sn into simple
summands si (i = 1, . . . , n). Let R, S, and Si denote the corresponding connected Lie
subgroups of G. One has G = RS as a set. This is called a Levi decomposition of G.
The subgroup R is solvable, normal, and closed. The subgroup S is semisimple and locally
isomorphic to the direct product S1 × · · · × Sn of simple factors, but it need not be closed
in G.

Theorem 2 ([8]). Let G be a connected Lie group, let G = RS denote a Levi decomposi-
tion, and suppose that S is locally isomorphic to the product S1 × · · · × Sn of connected
simple factors. Then the following are equivalent:

(i) the group G has the AP,
(ii) the group S has the AP,
(iii) the groups Si, with i = 1, . . . , n, have the AP,
(iv) the real rank of the groups Si, with i = 1, . . . , n, is at most 1.

Proof. The equivalence of (iii) and (iv) is [7, Theorem 5.1].
Suppose (iv) holds. We show that (i) and (ii) hold. The proof of this implication is the
proof from [8]. For completeness, we include it: The group R is solvable, so it has the
AP. Since the AP is preserved under group extenstions [9, Theorem 1.15], it is therefore
enough to prove that G/R has the AP. The Lie algebra of G/R is the Lie algebra of S, so
to prove (i) and (ii), it sufﬁces to prove that any connected Lie group S ′ locally isomorphic
to S1 × · · ·× Sn has the AP. Using [9, Theorem 1.15] again, we may assume that the center
of S ′ is trivial. If Zi denotes the center of Si, then S ′ ≃ (S1/Z1) × · · · × (Sn/Zn). Each
group Si/Zi has real rank at most 1 and hence has the AP [3, 10]. Hence S ′ has the AP.
Suppose (iv) does not hold. We show that (i) does not hold (which also proves that (ii) does
not hold). Fix some i. The closure Si of Si in G is of the form SiC for some connected,
compact, central subgroup of G (see [13, p. 614]). Let G′ = G/C, and let π : G → G′
be the quotient homomorphism. As C is compact, π is a closed map, and π(Si) = π(Si)
is a closed subgroup of G′. Since ker π ∩ Si is contained in the center of Si and therefore
is discrete (in the topology of Si), the group π(Si) is locally isomorphic to Si. If now the
real rank of Si is at least 2, then π(Si) does not have the AP [7, Theorem 5.1]. Hence G′
does not have the AP, and it follows that G does not have the AP.

A CHARACTERIZATION OF ALMOST CONNECTED GROUPS WITH THE AP

Let G be a locally compact group. Recall from [8] that there is a unique left invariant mean
on M0A(G), and we say that G has property (T∗) if this mean is weak∗ continuous. It is
clear that non-compact groups with property (T∗) do not have the AP. We establish the
following converse for almost connected groups.

Theorem 3. For an almost connected locally compact group G, the following are equiva-
lent.

(1) G has the AP.
(2) No closed non-compact subgroup of G has property (T∗).

Proof. (1) =⇒ (2) is clear and holds also without the assumption of almost connectedness.
We prove (2) =⇒ (1). Suppose G does not have AP. We prove the existence of a closed
non-compact subgroup of G with property (T∗).
As G is almost connected, there is a compact normal subgroup K of G such that G/K is
a Lie group (see [12, Theorem 4.6]). Then G/K is a connected Lie group without the AP.
It follows from the remark after Theorem C in [8] that we can ﬁnd a closed, non-compact
subgroup H0 ≤ G/K with property (T∗). Let H be the inverse image of H0 in G. By [8,
Proposition 5.13], H has property (T∗), and H is clearly a closed non-compact subgroup
of G.
(cid:3)

Remark 4. Theorem 3 is not true in general without the assumption of almost connected-
ness. In fact, there are discrete groups without the AP and without inﬁnite subgroups with
property (T∗). This is not a new result, but simply a compilation of known results, the last
ingredient being the recent result of Arzhantseva and Osajda (see [14, Theorem 2] and [1])
about the existence of discrete groups without property A but with the Haagerup property.
Let G be such a group.
As property (T∗) implies property (T) (see [8, Proposition 5.3]), and property (T) is an
obstruction to the Haagerup property, it is clear that G has no inﬁnite subgroups with
property (T∗).
On the other hand, if the discrete group G had the AP then its reduced group C∗-algebra
would have the strong operator approximation property. This is known to imply exactness
of the group C∗-algebra, which implies that G is an exact group. Finally, exactness for
groups is equivalent to property A. This shows that G cannot have the AP. Proofs of all the
claimed statements can be found in [2, Chapters 5 and 12].
