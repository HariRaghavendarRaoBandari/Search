ON FINITE ca-F GROUPS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS

EVGENIY N. MYSLOVETS, ALEXANDER F. VASIL’EV

Abstract. Let F be a class of groups. A group G is called ca-F-group if its
every non-abelian chief factor is simple and H/K ⋋ CG(H/K) ∈ F for every
abelian chief factor H/K of G.
In this paper, we investigate the structure
of a ﬁnite ca-F-group. Properties of mutually permutable products of ﬁnite
ca-F-groups are studied.

1. Introduction

Only ﬁnite groups are considered. The concept of composition formation was
introduced by L.A. Shemetkov [15] and R. Baer in an unpublished paper (noted
in [7, IV, p. 370]). Every saturated formation is a composition formation. The
class of all quasinilpotent groups is an example of composition, but not saturated
formation. Guo Wenbin and A. N. Skiba [9, 10] introduced the concept of qausi-
F-group that is a generalization of quasinilpotency.
In [9] they proved that the
class of all qausi-F-groups is a composition formation if F is a saturated formation
containing all nilpotent groups. In [9, 10] some applications of formations of qausi-
F-groups were considered.

In [19] V.A. Vedernikov introduced the deﬁnition of a c-supersoluble group. Re-
call [19] that a group G is called c-supersoluble if every chief factor of G is simple.
In [18] A.F. Vasil’ev and T.I. Vasil’eva proved that the class Uc of all c-supersoluble
groups is a composition but not a saturated formation. D. Robinson (using nota-
tion: SC-group) [13] established the structural properties of ﬁnite c-supersoluble
groups.

In [12] the following generalization of c-supersolubility was proposed.
Let F be a class of groups. Recall [17] that a chief factor H/K of group G is

called F-central provided H/K ⋋ G/CG(H/K) ∈ F.

Deﬁnition 1.1 ([12]). Let F be a class of groups. A group G is called a ca-F-group
if its every non-abelian chief factor is simple and every abelian chief factor of G is
F-central.

The class of all ca-F-groups is denoted by Fca. If F = U we have that Fca = Uc.
If F = NA, then Fca = (NA)ca is the class of all groups whose every non-abelian
chief factor is simple and AutG(H/K) is abelian for every abelian chief factor H/K.
If F = G then Fca is the class of all SNAC-groups [13], i.e the class of all groups
whose all non-abelian factors are simple.

The class of all ca-F-groups is a composition formation [12]. Also in [12] some

properties of the products of normal ca-F-subgroups were found.

Recall [17, §8], Z F

∞(G) denotes the F-hypercenter of a group G. Z F

∞(G) is the

product of all normal subgroups H of G whose G-chief factors are F-central.

The following theorem is an extension of Robinson’s result [13] for case when F

is a soluble saturated formation.

Theorem A. Let F be a soluble saturated formation. A group G is a ca-F-group
if and only if G satisﬁes:

1. GS = GF;
2. If GS 6= 1 then GS/Z(GS) is a direct product of G-invariant non-abelian

simple groups;

3. Z(GS) ⊆ Z F

∞(G)

Following Carocca [6], we say that G = HK is the mutually permutable product
of subgroups H and K if H permutes with every subgroup of K and K permutes
with every subgroup of H. The mutually permutable products of supersoluble
and c-supersoluble subgroups were investigated in many works of diﬀerent authors
(see monograph [3]). A lot of papers were dedicated to the case where G = HK
is the mutually permutable product of subgroups H and K which belong to a
saturated formation F. Therefore we have the following problem.

Problem. Lets F be a composition formation. What is the structure of the

group G = HK where H and K are mutually permutable F-subgroups of G.

In this paper this problem is solving for a formation of ca-F-groups where F is a

saturated formation contaning all supersoluble groups.

Theorem B. Let F be a saturated formation containing the class U of supersoluble
groups. Let a group G = HK be the product of the mutually permutable subgroups
H and K of G. If G is a ca-F-group then both H and K are ca-F-groups.

Corollary B.1 ([4]). Let the group G = HK be the mutually permutable product
of the subgroups H and K of G. If G is a c-supersoluble group then both H and K
are c-supersoluble groups.

Corollary B.2 ([5]). Let the group G = HK be the mutually permutable product
of the subgroups H and K of G. If G is a SNAC-group then both H and K are
SNAC-groups.

Corollary B.3. Let the group G = HK be the mutually permutable product of
the subgroups H and K of G.
If G is a ca-NA-group then both H and K are
ca-NA-groups.

It is well known that in general, the product G = HK of two normal supersoluble
subgroups of a ﬁnite group G need not be supersoluble. In 1957 Baer [2] established
that such group G will be a supersoluble if and only if the derived subgroup G′ of
G is nilpotent. The next theorem is an extension of this result.

Theorem C. Let F be a saturated formation containing the class U of supersoluble
groups. Let the group G = HK be the product of the mutually permutable ca-F-
subgroups H and K of G. If the derived subgroup G′ of G is quasinilpotent, then
G is a ca-F-group.

Corollary C.1 ([4]). Let the group G = HK be the product of the mutually per-
mutable c-supersoluble subgroups H and K of G. If the derived subgroup G′ of G
is quasinilpotent, then G is c-supersoluble.

ON FINITE ca-F GROUPS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS

Corollary C.2 ([1]). Let the group G = HK be the product of the mutually per-
mutable supersoluble subgroups H and K of G. If the derived subgroup G′ of G is
nilpotent, then G is supersoluble.

Corollary C.3. Let the group G = HK be the product of the mutually permutable
ca-NA-subgroups H and K of G. If the derived subgroup G′ of G is quasinilpotent,
then G is ca-NA-group.

The following corollary extends [12] the properties of normal products of ca-F-

groups.

Corollary C.4. Let F be a saturated formation containing the class U of supersol-
uble groups. If G = HK is the product of normal ca-F-subgroups H and K of G
and the derived subgroup G′ of G is quasinilpotent, then G is a ca-F-group.

2. Preliminaries

Standard notations, notions and results are used in the paper (see [7, 16]). Recall
signiﬁcant notions and notations for this paper. P is the set of all prime numbers;
1 is an identity group; H ⋋ K is a semidirect product of groups H and K; G is
the class of all groups; S is the class of all soluble groups; U is the class of all
supersoluble groups; Uc is the class of all c-supersoluble groups; N is the class of
nilpotent groups; Np is the class of all p-groups; J is the class of all simple groups;
A(p − 1) is the class of all abelian groups of exponent dividing p − 1.

A formation is a homomorph F of groups such that each group G has the smallest
normal subgroup (called F-residual and denoted by GF) with quotient in F. A
formation F is said to be saturated if it contains each group G with G/Φ(G) ∈ F. A
formation F is said to be (normally) hereditary if it contains all (normal) subgroups
of every group in F.

Let F be a non-empty formation. GF denotes F-radical of group G, i.e., the

largest normal F-subgroup of G

A function f : P → {formations of groups} is called a local formation function.
The symbol LF (f ) denotes the class of all groups such that either G = 1 or G 6= 1
and G/CG(H/K) ∈ f (p) for every chief factor H/K of G and every p ∈ π(H/K).
The class LF (f ) is a non-empty formation.

For a formation F, if there exists a formation function f such that F = LF (f )
then F is called a local formation. It is known that a formation F is local if and
only if it is saturated [7, IV, Theorem 4.6].

A formation F is said to be solubly saturated, composition, or Baer-local forma-
tion if it contains each group G with G/Φ(N ) ∈ F for some soluble normal subgroup
N of G. For every function f of the form f : J → {formations of groups} we put,
CLF (f ) = {G is a group | G/CG(H/K) ∈ f (A) for every A ∈ KH/K)}. It is well
known that a composition formation (or a Baer-local formation if we use the termi-
nology in [7]) F is exactly a class F = CLF (f ) for some function f of above-mention
form. In this case, the function f is said to be a composition satellite [14] of the
formation F.

A local function f is called an inner local function if f (p) ⊆ LF (f ) for every
prime p. Function f is called a maximal inner local function of formation F if f
is a maximal element of set of all inner local functions of formation F. Similarly,
we can introduce the notion of the inner composition satellite and maximal inner
composition satellite.

4

EVGENIY N. MYSLOVETS, ALEXANDER F. VASIL’EV

Every local (composition) formation has the unique maximal inner local function

(composition satellite) [16, ch. 1].

We will use the following results.

Lemma 2.1 ([12]). Let F be a class of groups. Then the class Fca is a non-empty
formation.

Theorem 2.2 ([12]). Let F be a saturated formation and f is its maximal inner local
function. Then the formation Fca is a composition formation and has a maximal
inner composition satellite h such that h(N ) = Fca, if N is a non-abelian group
and h(N ) = f (p), if N is a simple p-group, where p is a prime.

Lemma 2.3 ([18]). Let F be a formation and N be a minimal normal subgroup of
G such as |N | = pa for some prime p. If N contains in the subgroup H of G and
H/CH (U/V ) ∈ F for every H-chief factor U/V of N , then H/CH (N ) ∈ NpF.

Lemma 2.4 ([3]). Assume that the subgroups A and B of the group G are mutually
permutable and that N is a normal subgroup of G. Then the subgroups AN/N and
BN/N are mutually permutable in G/N .

Lemma 2.5 ([3]). Let the group G = AB be the mutually permutable product of
the subgroups A and B. Then:

1. If N is a maximal normal subgroup of G, then {AN, BN, (A∩B)N } ⊆ {N, G}.
2. If N is a non-abelian minimal normal subgroup of G, then {A ∩ N, B ∩ N } ⊆
{N, 1} and N = (N ∩A)(N ∩B) (that is, N is prefactorised with respect to G = AB).
3. If N is a minimal normal subgroup of G, then N ≤ A ∩ B or [N, A ∩ B] = 1.
4. If N is a minimal normal subgroup of G, then {A ∩ N, B ∩ N } ⊆ {N, 1}.
5. If N is a minimal normal subgroup of G contained in A and B ∩ N = 1, then

N ≤ CG(A) or N ≤ CG(B). If furthermore N is not cyclic, then N ≤ CG(B).

Lemma 2.6 ([3]). Let the group G = AB be the product of the mutually permutable
subgroups A and B and let F be a saturated formation containing the class U of all
supersoluble groups. If (A ∩ B)G = 1, then G ∈ F if and only if A ∈ F and B ∈ F.

3. Proof of theorem A

In this section we prove the theorem that describes the structure of ﬁnite ca-F-

group.

Lemma 3.1. . Let F be a soluble formation containing the class U of all supersol-
uble groups. If G is a ca-F-group then the following statements hold:

1. GS ≤ CG(GS);
2. (GS)S ≤ Z(GS).

Proof. Prove the statement 1. Obviously that all chief factors of group G below
subgroup GS are F-central. Hence subgroup GS is F-hypercentral and thus it is
subgroup of F-hypercenter Z F
∞(G). By Corollary 9.3.2 [16] we have that GF ≤
CG(Z F

∞(G)). Since F is a soluble formation, GS ≤ GF ≤ CG(GS).

Prove the statement 2. Let R = (GS)S. Since R char GS E G, it follows R E G.
Therefore R ≤ GS. Hence GS ≤ CG(R) by statement 1 of the Lemma. The
statement 2 is true.
(cid:3)

Proof of theorem A. Denote by D the soluble residual GS of group G.

Let G be a ca-F-group. If G is soluble, then D = 1 and G ∈ F. So G satisﬁes
the Statements 1, 2, and 3. We assume that group G is not soluble. Then D 6= 1.
Since F is a soluble formation, G/GF ∈ F ⊆ S. Hence D ⊆ GF. Since Fca is
a formation, it follows G/D ∈ Fca. By solvability of quotient G/D we have that
G/D ∈ F. Hence GF ⊆ D and D = GF. The Statement 1 holds. Note that all chief
factors of G below Z(D) are abelian and therefore are F-central. This means, that
Z(D) is F-hypercentral and the Statement 3 holds.

We show that D/Z(D) is a direct product of G-invariant simple groups.
Assume that Z(D) = 1. Let N1 be a minimal normal subgroup of G con-
If N1 is abelian, then it follows from N1 ≤ DS and the State-
tained in D.
ment 2 of Lemma 3.1 that N1 ≤ Z(D) = 1. Hence N1 is non-abelian. Since
G ∈ Fca, we have that N1 is a simple. Note that G/CG(N1) is isomorphic to
a subgroup of Aut(N1) and N1CG(N1)/CG(N1) is isomorphic to Inn(N1). So
G/N1CG(N1) ≃ (G/CG(N1))/(N1CG(N1)/CG(N1)) is isomorphic to a subgroup
of Aut(N1)/Inn(N1). From the validity of the Schreier conjecture, it follows that
G/N1CG(N1) is soluble. Then D ≤ N1CG(N1). Hence D = D ∩ N1CG(N1) =
N1(D ∩ CG(N1)) = N1CD(N1) and N1 ∩ CD(N1) = 1.
If D = N1, then the
Statement 2 holds. Assume that D is not simple. Therefore, CD(N1) 6= 1. The
Statement 2 holds in the case when CD(N1) is simple. Assume that CD(N1) is
not a simple and let N2 be a minimal normal subgroup of G contained in CD(N1).
Since Z(D) = 1 and the Statement 2 of lemma 3.1, it follows that N2 is a sim-
ple non-abelian subgroup. By the above D = N2CD(N2). By Dedekind identity
CD(N1) = CD(N1) ∩ N2CD(N2) = N2(CD(N1) ∩ CD(N2)) = N2CL(N2), where
L = CD(N1) ∩ CD(N2). Then D = N1N2CL(N2). Applying above to CD(N2) and
etc. we can conclude that D = N1 × N2 × · · · × Nt is the direct product of minimal
normal subgroups of G, each of them simple, as desired. So the Statement 2 holds.
Let Z(D) 6= 1. Since G/Z(D) ∈ Fca and (G/Z(D))S = D/Z(D), the Statement
1 and 3 holds for G/Z(D). Denote T /Z(D) = Z(D/Z(D)). Then T is a normal
soluble subgroup of D. By lemma 3.1 T is contained in the center Z(D). Therefore
Z(D/Z(D)) = 1. By the above the Statement 1 holds for G/Z(D).

Conversely, assume that a group G satisﬁes the Statements 1, 2 and 3. We
consider a chief series of G which passes through the subgroup D = GS. Note
the all chief factors above D are abelian and F-central. By the Statement 2 the
quotient D/Z(D) is the direct product of minimal normal subgroups of G/Z(D),
which are simple. All chief factors of G below Z(D) are F-central by the Statement
3. By virtue of Jordan-Holder’s theorem for groups with operators [7, A, 3.2] and
the Deﬁnition 1.1, G ∈ Fca.
(cid:3)

4. Proof of theorem B and C

In this section we prove some properties of the mutually permutable products of

ca-F-groups.

Proof of Theorem B. Assume that that this theorem is false and let G be a coun-
terexample of minimal order. Let N be a minimal normal subgroup of G. If N = G,
then G is simple. Hence H ∈ Fca and K ∈ Fca. Assume N 6= G. By Lemma 2.4
G/N = HN/N · KN/N is the mutually permutable product of subgroups HN/N
and KN/N of G/N . Note that G/N ∈ Fca. Then all conditions of the theorem hold
for G/N . Therefore HN/N ≃ H/(H ∩ N ) ∈ Fca and KN/N ≃ K/(K ∩ N ) ∈ Fca.

6

EVGENIY N. MYSLOVETS, ALEXANDER F. VASIL’EV

Since Fca is a formation by Lemma 2.1, it follows that N is the unique minimal
normal subgroup of G.

Let N be a non-abelian group. Then N is simple. According to Lemma 2.5 we

should consider the following cases.

1. Let H ∩ N = K ∩ N = N . Then N ≤ H ∩ K, H/(H ∩ N ) = H/N ∈ Fca and

K/(K ∩ N ) = K/N ∈ Fca. Hence H and K are ca-F-groups, a contradiction.

2. Let H ∩ N = K ∩ N = 1. Then H/(H ∩ N ) ≃ H and K/(K ∩ N ) ≃ K are

ca-F-groups, a contradiction.

3. Let H ∩ N = N and K ∩ N = 1. Then H/(H ∩ N ) = H/N ∈ Fca and H is a

ca-F-group and K/(K ∩ N ) ≃ K is a ca-F-group. A contradiction.

4. Let H ∩ N = 1 and K ∩ N = N . This case is considered similarly to the
(cid:3)

case 3.

To prove the Theorem C we need the following results.

Lemma 4.1. Let the group G has the unique minimal normal subgroup N = N1 ×
· · · × Nt and Ni are isomorphic simple non-abelian groups for all i = 1, . . . , t. If
N ⊆ H, where H is a ca-F-subgroup of G, then Ni ⊳ H for all i = 1, . . . , t.
x|x ∈ Hi of subgroup
Proof. Let i ∈ {1, . . . , t}. Consider normal closure N H
Ni in H. Note that Ni ⊳ ⊳ G. Hence Ni ⊳ ⊳ H. By the Lemma 9.17 [11] we have
that N H
is a minimal normal subgroup of H. Since subgroup N H
is non-abelian
i
i
and isomorphic to the chief factor of ca-F-subgroup H, then N H
is simple. Then,
i
by Ni ⊳ ⊳ N H
(cid:3)

i = Ni. Hence Ni ⊳ H for all i = 1, . . . , t.

i = hNi

i we have that N H

Lemma 4.2. Let F be a composition formation and f is an inner composition
satellite of F. Let a group G has the unique minimal normal subgroup N and N is
an abelian p-group for some prime p. The chief factor N of G is F-central in G if
and only if G/CG(N ) ∈ f (p).
Proof. Let G/CG(N ) ∈ f (p). Consider semidirect product R = N ⋋ G/CG(N ).
Note that N is the unique minimal normal subgroup of R and CR(N ) = N . Then
R/CR(N ) ≃ G/CG(N ) ∈ f (p) ⊆ F. Hence R ∈ F, i.e. the chief factor N/1 of G is
F-central.

Conversely, assume that N is F-central chief factor of G. Then R = N ⋋
G/CG(N ) ∈ F, where N is the unique minimal normal subgroup of R and CG(N ) =
N . Hence R/CR(N ) ≃ G/CG(N ) ∈ f (p).
(cid:3)

Lemma 4.3. Let F be a formation and A(p − 1) ⊆ F. Let G = HK be the mutually
permutable products of subgroup H and K, where H, K ∈ NpF and G ∈ NpA. Then
G ∈ NpF.
Proof. Assume that this lemma is false and let G be a counterexample of minimal
order. Let N be a minimal normal subgroup of G. We can assume without loss
of generality that G 6= N . By Lemma 2.4 G/N = HN/N · KN/N is the mutually
permutable product of subgroups HN/N and KN/N of G/N . Note that HN/N ∈
NpF, HN/N ∈ NpF and G/N ∈ NpA. Then all conditions of

the Lemma 4.3 hold for G/N . Therefore G/N ∈ NpF. Since NpF is a formation,
it follows that N is the unique minimal normal subgroup of G. We note that N is a
q-group for some prime q 6= p. Since G ∈ NpA and Op(G) = 1, we have that G ∈ A.
Therefore H ∈ F and K ∈ F. Since N is the unique minimal normal subgroup of
G, it follows that G is a cyclic q-group. Since G = HK, we have that G = H or
G = K, i.e. G ∈ F.

Proof of Theorem C. Assume that this theorem is false and let G be a counterexam-
ple of minimal order. Let N be a minimal normal subgroup of G. If N = G, then G
is simple. Hence G ∈ Fca. Assume N 6= G. By Lemma 2.4 G/N = HN/N · KN/N
is the mutually permutable product of subgroups HN/N and KN/N of G/N . Note
that the derived subgroup (G/N )′ of G/N is quasinilpotent. Then all conditions
of the Theorem hold for G/N . Therefore G/N ∈ Fca. Since Fca is a formation by
Lemma 2.1, it follows that N is the unique minimal normal subgroup of G.

Let N be a non-abelian group. Then N = N1 ×· · ·×Nt, where Ni are isomorphic
simple non-abelian groups for all i = 1, . . . , t. According to Lemma 2.5 we should
consider the following cases.

1. Let H ∩ N = K ∩ N = N . Then N ⊆ H ∩ K. Since H and K are
ca-F-subgroups and N = N1 × · · · × Nt, it follows that Ni ⊳ H and Ni ⊳ K by
Lemma 4.1. Hence by G = HK we have that Ni ⊳ G for all i = 1, . . . , t. Since N
is the unique minimal normal subgroup of G, it follows that t = 1 and N is simple.
Since G/N ∈ Fca, we have that G ∈ Fca. A contradiction.

2. Let H ∩ N = K ∩ N = 1. Then N = (H ∩ N )(K ∩ N ) = 1 by Lemma 2.5(2).

A contradiction with choice of N .

3. Let H ∩N = N and K ∩N = 1. Then N ⊆ H and N ≤ CG(H) or N ≤ CG(K)
by Lemma 2.5(5). Since N ≤ H and N is non-abelian, we have that N ≤ CG(K).
Since N = N1 × · · · × Nt, it follows that Ni ≤ CG(K) for all i = 1, . . . , t. By
Ni ≤ H we have that Ni ⊳ H for all i = 1, . . . , t by Lemma 4.1. By G = HK
we have that Ni ⊳ G. Since N is the unique minimal normal subgroup of G, it
follows that N = Ni and N is simple. Since G/N ∈ Fca, we have that G ∈ Fca. A
contradiction.

4. Let H ∩ N = 1 and K ∩ N = N . This case is considered similarly to the

case 3.

Assume N is an abelian group. Then N is a p-group for some prime p. By
Theorem 2.2 formation Fca has the maximal inner composition satellite h such
that h(N ) = f (p), where f is a maximal inner local function of F. According to
Lemma 2.5 we should consider the following cases.

1. Let H ∩ N = K ∩ N = N . Then N ⊆ H ∩ K. Let U/V is any H-chief factor of
N . Since H ∈ Fca, it follows that H/CH (U/V ) ∈ h(p). By Lemma 2.3 we have that
H/CH (N ) ∈ Nph(p) = h(p). Similarly we can show that K/CK(N ) ∈ Nph(p) =
h(p). Note the group G/CG(N ) = HCG(N )/CG(N ) · KCG(N )/CG(N ) is the mu-
tually permutable product of subgroups HCG(N )/CG(N ) and KCG(N )/CG(N ) of
G/CG(N ).

Since N ⊆ G′ and G′ is quasinilpotent, it follows that G′/CG′(N ) ∈ Np by
Lemma 2.3. So (G/CG(N ))′ = G′CG(N )/CG(N ) ≃ G′/CG′(N ) is a p-group. Since
G/CG(N )/(G/CG(N ))′ ∈ A, it follows that G/CG(N ) ∈ NpA. By Lemma 4.3 for
G/CG(N ) we have that G/CG(N ) ∈ Nph(p) = h(p) ⊆ Fca. Therefore G ∈ Fca. A
contradiction.

2. Let H ∩ N = K ∩ N = 1. Then N /∈ H ∩ K and (H ∩ K)G = 1. If H S = 1
and K S = 1, then H and K are soluble. Hence H ∈ F and K ∈ F. By Lemma 2.6
we have that G ∈ F ⊆ Fca, a contradiction. Hence we can assume without loss of
generality that H S 6= 1. Then H S E G by Corollary 4.3.6 [3]. Hence N ≤ H S.
Therefore N ≤ H ∩ N = 1, a contradiction.

3. Let H ∩ N = N and K ∩ N = 1. Assume that N is non-cyclic subgroup.
Then N ≤ CG(K) by Lemma 2.5(5). Hence K ⊆ CG(N ) and G/CG(N ) =

8

HCG(N )/CG(N ) · KCG(N )/CG(N ) = HCG(N )/CG(N ) ≃ H/(CG(N ) ∩ H) =
H/CH (N ). Since N ⊆ H and H ∈ Fca, it follows that H/CH (N ) ∈ h(p) by
Lemma 2.3. By Lemma 4.2 we have that factor N is F-central chief factor of G.
Then G ∈ Fca, a contradiction. Let N be a cyclic group. Then |N | = p and
G/CG(N ) is a cyclic group of order dividing p − 1. Hence G/CG(N ) ∈ A(p − 1) ⊆
f (p) = h(p). Since G/N ∈ Fca, it follows that G ∈ Fca, a contradiction.

4. Let H ∩ N = 1 and K ∩ N = N . This case is considered similarly to the
(cid:3)

case 3.

5. Final remarks

Many diﬀerent speciﬁc examples of composition formations containing all super-

soluble groups can be built using the concept of ca-F-group.

According to [7], a rank function is a map R : p → R(p) which associates
with each prime p a set R(p) of natural numbers. With each rank function R we
associate a class [7]

F(R) = (G ∈ S |

for all prime p ∈ P each p-factor of G
has rank in R(p)),

that is a formation.
If F(R) is a saturated formation, then rank function is called a saturated (see [7,
p. 484]). A rank function R is said to have full characteristic if R(p) 6= ∅ for all
p ∈ P.

Note that if R is a saturated rank function of full characteristic, by [7, IV, 4.3],

we have 1 ∈ R(p) for all prime p ∈ P and therefore U ⊆ F(R).

If a rank function R is deﬁned, then for all prime p ∈ P are deﬁned [7]

π(G) = R(p) ∩ P and

e(p) = {pm − 1 | m ∈ R(p)}.

By Aπ(p)′(e(p)) we denote a class of abelian π(p)′-group with exponent dividing

e(p) that is a formation.

According to [7] the following lemma holds.

Lemma 5.1 ([7]). Let R is a saturated rank function of full characteristic. Then
R satisﬁes the following conditions

RF1: If n ∈ R(p) and m | n, then m ∈ R(p);
RF2: If {m, n} ∈ R(p), then mn ∈ R(p);
RF3: If p and q are distinct primes with q ∈ R(p) and if m ∈ R(p), then

qm − 1 ∈ R(p);

RF4: If p, q ∈ P and r ∈ N satisfy the following conditions:
(i) p | (qm − 1) for some m ∈ R(p),
(ii) q | (pn − 1) for some n ∈ R(p),
(iii) r | (pk − 1) for some k ∈ R(p),
(iv) p ∈ R(p), r ∈ R(p),
then r ∈ R(p).

Local function of formation F(R) in the case when R is a saturated rank function

is described in theorem 2.18 [7, p. 490] which we form as lemma.

Lemma 5.2. Let R is a rank function and let ˆF(R) is a local formation deﬁned by
local function f such that f (p) = Aπ(p)′ (e(p))Sπ(p) for all prime p. Then any two
of the following statements are equivalent:

(a) R is a saturated rank function;

(b) R satisﬁes Conditions RF1-RF4;
(c) ˆF = F.

Corollary B.4. Let R be a saturated rank function of full characteristic and the
group G = HK be the mutually permutable product of the subgroups H and K of
G. If G is a ca-F(R)-group, then H and K are also ca-F(R)-groups.

Corollary C.5. Let R be a saturated rank function of full characteristic and the
group G = HK be the mutually permutable product of the ca-F(R)-subgroups H and
K of G. If the derived subgroup G′ of G is quasinilpotent, then G is a ca-F(R)-
group.
