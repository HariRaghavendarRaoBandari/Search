The theory of deconﬁned quantum critical points describes phase transitions

at temperature T = 0 outside the standard paradigm, predicting continuous

transformations between certain ordered states where conventional theory re-

quires discontinuities. Numerous computer simulations have offered no proof

of such transitions, however, instead ﬁnding deviations from expected scal-

ing relations that were neither predicted by the DQC theory nor conform to

standard scenarios. Here we show that this enigma can be resolved by intro-

ducing a critical scaling form with two divergent length scales. Simulations of

a quantum magnet with antiferromagnetic and dimerized ground states con-

ﬁrm the form, proving a continuous transition with deconﬁned excitations and

also explaining anomalous scaling at T > 0. Our ﬁndings revise prevailing

paradigms for quantum criticality, with potentially far-reaching implications

for many strongly-correlated materials.

Introduction In analogy with classical phase transitions driven by thermal ﬂuctuations, con-

densed matter systems can undergo drastic changes as parameters regulating quantum ﬂuctu-

ations are tuned at low temperatures. Some of these quantum phase transitions can be the-

oretically understood as rather straight-forward generalizations of thermal phase transitions

[1, 2], where, in the conventional Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson (LGW) paradigm, states of mat-

ter are characterized by order parameters. Many strongly-correlated quantum materials seem to

defy such a description, however, and call for new ideas.

A promising proposal is the theory of deconﬁned quantum critical (DQC) points in certain

two-dimensional (2D) quantum magnets [3, 4], where the order parameters of the antiferro-

magnetic (N´eel) state and the competing dimerized state (the valence-bond-solid, VBS) are not

fundamental variables but composites of fractional degrees of freedom carrying spin S = 1/2.

These spinons are condensed and conﬁned, respectively, in the N´eel and VBS state, and become

deconﬁned at the DQC point separating the two states. Establishing the applicability of the still

controversial DQC scenario would be of great interest in condensed matter physics, where it

may play an important role in strongly-correlated systems such as the cuprate superconduc-

tors [5]. There are also intriguing DQC analogues to quark conﬁnement and other aspects of

high-energy physics, e.g., an emergent gauge ﬁeld and the Higgs mechanism and boson [6].

The DQC theory represents the culmination of a large body of ﬁeld-theoretic works on VBS

states and quantum phase transitions out of the N´eel state [7, 8, 9, 2, 10]. The postulated SU(N)
symmetric non-compact (NC) CPN−1 action can be solved when N → ∞ [11, 5, 12] but non-
perturbative numerical simulations are required to study small N. The most natural physical

realizations of the N´eel–VBS transition for electronic SU(2) spins are frustrated quantum mag-

nets [9], which, however, are notoriously difﬁcult to study numerically [13, 14]. Other models

were therefore pursued. In the J-Q model [15], the Heisenberg exchange J between S = 1/2

spins is supplemented by a VBS-inducing four-spin term Q which is amenable to efﬁcient quan-

1

tum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. Although many results

for the J-Q model support the DQC scenario, it has not been possible to draw deﬁnite conclu-

sions because of violations of expected scaling relations that affect many properties. Similar

anomalies were later observed in three-dimensional loop [24] and dimer [25] models, which

are also potential realizations of the DQC point. Simulations of the NCCP1 action as well have

been hard to reconcile with the theory [26, 27, 21].

One interpretation of the unusual scaling behaviors is that the transitions are ﬁrst-order, as

generally required within the LGW framework for order–order transitions where unrelated sym-

metries are broken. The DQC theory would then not apply to any of the systems studied so far,

thus casting doubts on the entire concept [17, 26, 21]. In other interpretations the transition is

continuous but unknown mechanisms cause strong corrections to scaling [18, 27, 28] or modify

the scaling more fundamentally in some yet unexplained way [19, 24]. The enigmatic current

state of affairs is well summed up in the recent Ref. [24].

Here we show that the DQC puzzle can be resolved based on a ﬁnite-size scaling Ansatz

including the two divergent length scales of the theory—the standard correlation length ξ, which
captures the growth of both order parameters (ξN´eel ∝ ξVBS), and a faster-diverging length ξ(cid:48)
associated with the thickness of VBS domain walls and spinon conﬁnement (the size of a spinon
bound state). We show that, contrary to past assumptions, ξ(cid:48) can govern the ﬁnite-size scaling
even of magnetic properties which are sensitive only to ξ in the thermodynamic limit. Our

simulations of the J-Q model at low temperatures and in the lowest S = 1 (two-spinon) excited

state demonstrate complete agreement with the two-length scaling hypothesis, with no other

anomalous scaling corrections remaining.

Finite-size scaling forms Consider ﬁrst a system with a single divergent correlation length
ξ ∝ |δ|−ν, where δ = g − gc is the distance to a phase transition driven by quantum ﬂuctuations

2

arising from non-commuting interactions controlled by g at T = 0 and gc is the critical value of

g. In ﬁnite-size scaling theory [29], for a system of linear size L (volume Ld in d dimensions),

close to δ = 0 a singular quantity A takes the form

A(g, L) = L−κ/νf (δL1/ν, L−ω),

(1)

where the exponents κ, ν, ω are tied to the universality class, κ also depends on A, and f ap-
proaches a constant when δ → 0 (up to scaling corrections ∝ L−ω). We assume T ∝ L−z (or,
alternatively, T = 0) so that scaling arguments depending on T have been eliminated.

The form (1) fails for some properties of the J-Q model [18, 19, 22] and other DQC candi-

date systems [26, 24, 25]. A prominent example is the spin stiffness, which for an inﬁnite 2D
system in the N´eel phase should scale as ρs ∝ δzν with z = 1 [3, 4, 1]. To eliminate the size
dependence when δ (cid:54)= 0 and L → ∞ in Eq. (1), we must have κ = zν and f (x, L−ω) ∝ xzν
for large x = δL1/ν. Thus, ρs(δ = 0, L) ∝ L−z and Lρs should be constant when L → ∞ if
z = 1. However, Lρs(L) at criticality instead appears to diverge slowly [17, 18, 21]. At ﬁrst

sight this might suggest z < 1, but other quantities, e.g., the magnetic susceptibility, instead

behave as if z > 1 [30]. Strong scaling corrections have been suggested as a way out of this

paradox [18, 19, 28]. Claims of a weak ﬁrst-order transition have also persisted [26, 27, 21],

though the continuous DQC scenario is supported by the absence of any of the usual ﬁrst-order

signals, e.g., the Binder cumulant does not exhibit any negative peak [18, 24].

To explain the scaling anomalies phenomenologically, in the presence of a second length

ξ(cid:48) ∝ δ−ν(cid:48) in the VBS, we propose that Eq (1) should be replaced by the form

A(g, L) = L−κ/˜νf (δL1/ν, δL1/ν(cid:48)

, L−ω),

(2)

where, unlike what was assumed in the past, ˜ν is not necessarily the same as the exponent ν

which governs the behavior of most observables in the thermodynamic limit. Instead, we show
that the criticality in the J-Q model generically demands ˜ν = ν(cid:48).

3

First assume ˜ν = ν. The correct thermodynamic limit with κ = zν for ρs can then be
obtained from Eq. (2) if f (x, y, L−ω) ∝ xzν for large x = δL1/ν, y = δL1/ν(cid:48) and, as before,
ρs(δ = 0, L) ∝ L−z. This behavior can also be expressed using a scaling function where
the second argument is the ratio of the two lengths; ˜f (δL1/ν, L1/ν(cid:48)−1/ν, L−ω). If ˜f (δ = 0) is
constant when L → ∞, then L1/ν(cid:48)−1/ν acts like just another irrelevant ﬁeld, as in the standard
scenario for dangerously irrelevant perturbations in classical clock models [31]. Our proposal is
a different large-L limit of Eq. (2) controlled by y = δL1/ν(cid:48), which leads to concrete predictions

of scaling anomalies. In the case of the stiffness, the correct thermodynamic limit is obtained
with ˜ν = ν(cid:48) and κ = zν if f (x, y, L−ω) ∝ yzν for large L. Then ρs(δ = 0) ∝ L−zν/ν(cid:48), which
we can also obtain with ˜ν = ν and ˜f ∝ Lz(1−ν/ν(cid:48)) for δ → 0. A function ˜f behaving as a power
of L for δ → 0 was implicitly suggested in Ref. [19], though with no speciﬁc form.

This alternative scaling behavior corresponds to ξ ∝ (ξ(cid:48))ν/ν(cid:48) saturating at ξ ∝ Lν/ν(cid:48) when
ξ(cid:48) → L upon approaching the critical point, in contrast to the standard scenario where ξ grows
until it also reaches L [32]. The criticality at distances r < Lν/ν(cid:48) is conventional, whereas
r > Lν/ν(cid:48) is governed by the unconventional power laws. Different behaviors for r (cid:28) L
and r ≈ L were actually observed in the recent loop-model study [24] and a dangerously
irrelevant ﬁeld was proposed as a possible explanation, but with no quantitative predictions of
the kind offered by our approach. The anomalous scaling law controlled by ν/ν(cid:48), which we
conﬁrm numerically below, is an unexpected feature of DQC physics and may also apply to

other systems with two divergent lengths.

where (cid:104)ij(cid:105) denotes nearest-neighbor sites on a periodic square lattice with L2 sites and the pairs
ij and kl in (cid:104)ijkl(cid:105) form horizontal and vertical edges of 2 × 2 plaquettes. This Hamiltonian
has all symmetries of the square lattice and the VBS ground state existing for g = J/Q <
gc (with gc ≈ 0.045) is columnar, breaking the translational and 90◦ rotational symmetries
spontaneously. The N´eel state for g > gc breaks the spin-rotation symmetry.

We will study several quantities in the neighborhood of gc. Although we have argued that
the asymptotic L → ∞ behavior when δ (cid:54)= 0 in Eq. (2) is controlled by the second argument
of f, the critical ﬁnite-size scaling close to δ = 0 can still be governed by the ﬁrst argument
[32]. We will demonstrate that, depending on the quantity, either δL1/ν or δL1/ν(cid:48) is the relevant
argument, and, therefore, ν and ν(cid:48) can be extracted using ﬁnite-size scaling with effectively
single-parameter forms. We will do this for manifestly dimensionless quantities, κ = 0 in

Eq. (2), before testing the anomalous powers of L in other quantities.

If the effective one-parameter scaling holds close to gc, then Eq. (2) implies that A(g, L1) =
A(g, L2) at some g = g∗(L1, L2) and a crossing-point analysis (Fisher’s phenomenological
renormalization) can be performed [29]. For a κ = 0 quantity, if L1 = L and L2 = rL with
r > 1 constant, a Taylor expansion of f shows that the crossing points g∗(L) approach gc as
g∗(L) − gc ∝ L−(1/ν+ω) if ν is the relevant exponent (which we assume here for deﬁniteness).
A∗ = A(g∗) approaches its limit Ac as A∗(L) − Ac ∝ L−ω, and one can also show that

converges to 1/ν at the rate L−ω. In practice, simulation data can be generated on a grid of
points close to the crossing values, with polynomials used for interpolation and derivatives. We

present details and tests of such a scheme for the Ising model in Supplementary Material.

In the S = 1 sector, spinon physics can be studied with projector QMC simulations in a

basis of valence bonds (singlet pairs) and two unpaired spins [33, 35]. Previously the size of

the spinon bound state in the J-Q model was extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit [34], but

the results were inconclusive as to the rate of divergence upon approaching the critical point.

Here we study the critical ﬁnite-size behavior. We deﬁne the size Λ of the spinon pair using the

strings connecting the unpaired spins in valence-bond QMC simulations [33, 35], as illustrated

in Fig. 1 and further discussed in Supplementary Material.

If Λ(g) ∝ ξ(cid:48)(g) when L → ∞, then Λ(gc) ∝ L follows from our proposed limit of Eq. (2).
If Λ manifestly probes only the longer length scale also in a ﬁnite system, which we will test,
then ν(cid:48) is the exponent controlling the crossing points of Λ/L. Data and ﬁts are presented in
Fig. 2 (left). Unlike other quantities used previously to extract the critical point [18], the drift
of g∗ with L is monotonic in this case and the convergence is rapid. All L ≥ 16 points are
consistent with the expected power-law correction, with 1/ν(cid:48) + ω ≈ 3.0 and gc = 0.04468(4),
where the number in parenthesis indicates the statistical uncertainty (one standard deviation) in

the preceding digit. The critical point agrees well with earlier estimates [18]. The crossing value
Λ∗/L also clearly converges and a slope analysis according to Eq. (4) gives ν(cid:48) = 0.585(18).

Next, in Fig. 2 (right) we analyze a Binder ratio, deﬁned with the z-component of the sub-
sz(cid:105)/(cid:104)|msz|(cid:105)2 and computed at T = 1/L as in Ref. [18].

Here the non-monotonic behavior of the crossing points necessitates several scaling corrections,

unless only the largest sizes are used. In either case, the L → ∞ behavior of g∗ is fully con-
sistent with gc obtained from Λ/L. R1(gc) has an uncertainty of over 1% because of the small
value of the subleading exponent; ω ≈ 0.4 ∼ 0.5. The slope estimator (4) of the exponent 1/ν
is monotonic and requires only a single L−ω correction, also with a small exponent ω ≈ 0.45.
The extrapolated exponent ν = 0.446(8) is close to the value obtained recently for the loop

model [24].

The above results support a non-trivial deconﬁnement process where the size of the bound

state diverges faster than the conventional correlation length. However, in the DQC theory the
fundamental longer length scale ξ(cid:48) is the thickness of a VBS domain wall. It can be extracted
from the domain wall energy per unit length, κ, which in the thermodynamic limit should scale
as κ ∝ (ξξ(cid:48))−1 [4]. In Supplementary Material we re-derive this form using a two-length scaling

Ansatz and discuss simulations of domain walls in a 3D clock model and the J-Q model. At
criticality, in the conventional scenario (exempliﬁed by the clock model) both ξ and ξ(cid:48) saturate
at L and κ ∝ L−2. For the J-Q model we instead ﬁnd κ ∝ L−a with a = 1.715(15) for large
L, as illustrated in Fig. 3(a). Our interpretation of this unconventional scaling is that, when
ξ(cid:48) saturates at L, ξ also stops growing and remains at ξ ∝ Lν/ν(cid:48). Thus κ ∝ L−(1+ν/ν(cid:48)) with
ν/ν(cid:48) = a − 1 = 0.715(15), which agrees reasonably well with ν/ν(cid:48) = 0.76(3) obtained from
the quantities in Fig. 2. The large error bar on the latter ratio leaves open the possibility that the
spinon conﬁnement exponent is between ν and the domain-wall exponent ν(cid:48) [4].

We also calculated the critical spin stiffness ρs and susceptibility χ(k = 2π/L) for the

smallest wave-number k = 2π/L, using T = 1/L. Conventional quantum-critical scaling

dictates that these quantities should decay as 1/L when z = 1 [2]. Instead, Figs. 3(b) and

(c) demonstrate clearly slower decays, Lρs and Lχ being slowly divergent, as had been found

in earlier works as well[17, 18, 30, 19, 21]. The unconventional limit of the scaling function
(2) requires Lρs and Lχ to diverge as L1−ν/ν(cid:48). The behaviors are indeed consistent with this
form and ν/ν(cid:48) ≈ 0.715 extracted from κ, with a correction ∝ L−ω with a small ω (close to

The mutually consistent scaling behavior of the three different

quantities lends strong support to the new type of criticality where the magnetic properties are
not decoupled from the longer VBS length scale ξ(cid:48) for ﬁnite L. The results are incompatible
with a ﬁrst-order transition, where, κ → constant, Lρs → L, Lχ → L.

Discussion We have shown that the effects of the larger divergent length scale ξ(cid:48) at the N´eel–
VBS transition are more dramatic than those caused by standard [31] dangerously-irrelevant

perturbations, and we therefore propose the term super-dangerous for this case. The universal-

ity class, in the sense of the normal critical exponents in the thermodynamic limit at T = 0,

are not affected by such perturbations, but anomalous power laws of the system size appear
generically in ﬁnite-size scaling. We have determined the value ν/ν(cid:48) ≈ 0.72 for the exponent
ratio governing the anomalous scaling in the J-Q spin model.

Loop and dimer models exhibit similar scaling anomalies [24, 25] and it would be interesting

to test the consistency between different quantities as we have done here. In simulations of the

NCCP1 action [21, 26, 27] one would at ﬁrst sight not expect any effects related to the longer

DQC length scale, because the monopoles responsible for the VBS condensation are not present

in the continuum theory [3]. There could still be some other super dangerous operator present

[see also Ref. [24]], perhaps related to lattice regularization.

The consequences of our ﬁndings extend also to T > 0 quantum criticality in the ther-

modynamic limit, because 1/T is the thickness of an equivalent system in the path integral

formulation [1, 2]. Anomalous ﬁnite-T behaviors of the J-Q model have already been ob-

served [18, 30]. For instance, the spin correlation length at T > 0, which should be affected by
deconﬁned spinons, grows faster than the normally expected form ∝ T −1 and the susceptibility
vanishes slower than T . Remarkably, the asymptotic forms ∝ T −ν(cid:48)/ν and T ν/ν(cid:48) can account for
the respective behaviors [32]. Thus, we ﬁnd a strong rationale to revise the experimentally most

9

important tenet of quantum criticality—the way scaling at the T = 0 critical point is related to

power laws in T at T > 0.

We conclude that quantum criticality with two divergent length scales is much richer than

previously anticipated. Our ﬁndings may apply to a wide range of strongly-correlated quantum

systems with more than one length scale and may help to resolve the mysteries still surrounding

scaling behaviors in materials such as the high-Tc cuprate superconductors.

Quantum Criticality with Two Length Scales

Hui Shao, Wenan Guo, and Anders W. Sandvik

In Sec. 1 we discuss the crossing-point analysis (phenomenological renormalization) underlying
the ﬁnite-size scaling studies summarized in Fig. 2. We derive the scaling properties of the
crossing points as a function of the system size and use the 2D Ising model as a bench-mark
case to demonstrate the unbiased nature of the method when all sources of statistical errors and
scaling corrections are considered.

In Sec. 2 we present the scaling arguments underlying the analysis of the domain-wall energy κ
of the critical J-Q model in Fig. 3(a). We begin with the simpler case of a generic system with
discrete symmetry-breaking at a critical point with a single divergent length scale, deriving the
scaling form of κ in the thermodynamic limit and for ﬁnite size. We then generalize to the case
when the thickness of the domain wall diverges faster than the correlation length and discuss the
different scenarios for ﬁnite-size scaling at criticality. We use the 2D Ising model as an example
to illustrate Monte Carlo (MC) procedures we have developed for computing the free-energy
differences needed for κ at thermal phase transitions. We also demonstrate conventional ﬁnite-
size scaling in a classical system with a dangerously irrelevant perturbation; the 3D six-state
clock model. For the J-Q model at T = 0, we discuss calculations of the ground state energy
with and without domain walls and supplement the results shown in Fig. 3(a) with results for
a different domain-wall boundary condition, demonstrating consistent anomalous scaling with
the same exponent ratio ν/ν(cid:48) in both cases.
In Sec. 3, to further motivate the two-length scaling form (2) and its unconventional limiting
behavior [demonstrated numerically in Figs. 3(b,c)], we present derivations of the quantum-
critical scaling forms of the spin stiffness and magnetic susceptibility by generalizing the ap-
proach of Fisher et al. [1] to the case of two divergent length scales.

In Sec. 4 we re-analyze previously published [30] results for the temperature dependence of the
spin correlation length and the magnetic susceptibility of the critical J-Q model. We demon-
strate that their T > 0 scaling anomalies can also be explained by exponents modiﬁed by the
exponent ratio ν/ν(cid:48).
In Sec. 5 we provide some more details of the T > 0 and T = 0 (ground-state projector) QMC
methods used in the studies of the J-Q model.

1 Crossing-point analysis

The crossing-point analysis employed in Fig. 2 is an extension of Fisher’s “phenomenological
renormalization”. We follow essentially the formalism developed and tested with numerically
exact transfer-matrix results for the Ising model in Ref. [29], but apply it to QMC data. In
Sec. 1.1 we discuss formalities and derivations of the exponents governing the drifts of crossing
points in the standard case, when there is a single divergent length scale. In Sec. 1.2 we discuss
why the single-length scaling form (1) can still be used to analyze crossing points and extract the
exponent ν controlling the shorter length scale, even in the case when the criticality is described
by the two-length ansatz (2) with the anomalous limit controlled by the longer length scale.
In Sec. 1.3 we discuss several practical issues and potential error sources (statistical as well as
systematical) that should be properly taken into account when analyzing crossing points. We
illustrate the procedure with data for the 2D Ising model, demonstrating the unbiased nature of
the approach by reproducing the exactly known critical temperature and critical exponents to
within small statistical errors.

1.1 Scaling corrections and crossing points
Consider ﬁrst the standard case of a single divergent length scale (correlation length) ξ ∝ |δ|−ν
as a function of the distance δ = g−gc to a critical point (a classical transition driven by thermal
ﬂuctuations at T > 0 or a quantum phase transition at T = 0). For some other singular quantity
A with the behavior A ∝ |δ|κ in the thermodynamic limit (valid for g < gc, g > gc, or both,
depending on the quantity) the ﬁnite size scaling is governed by the form
A(δ, L) = L−κ/νf (δL1/ν, λ1L−ω1, λ2L−ω2,···),

(S1)

where 0 < ωi < ωi+1 and the variables λi are irrelevant ﬁelds which in principle can be tuned by
introducing some other interactions in the Hamiltonian [36]. Keeping only the most important
irrelevant ﬁeld, using the notation ω ≡ ω1 for convenience, and suppressing the dependence on
the unknown value of λ1, we have Eq. (1) in the main text. The scaling function is non-singular
and we can Taylor expand it in the neighborhood of the critical point;
A(δ, L) = L−κ/ν(a0 + a1δL1/ν + b1L−ω + . . .).

(S2)

For two system sizes L1 = L and L2 = rL (r > 1), the two curves A(δ, L1) and A(δ, L2) take
the same value (cross each other) at the point

δ∗ =

1 − r−κ/ν

L−1/ν +

L−1/ν−ω.

(S3)

Thus, in general the ﬁnite-size value g∗(L) of the critical point deﬁned using such curve-
crossing points shifts with the system size as g∗(L) − gc ≡ δ∗ ∝ L−1/ν. However, if the
quantity A is asymptotically size-independent at the critical point, κ = 0, the ﬁrst term in
Eq. (S3) vanishes and the shift is faster;

g∗(L) − gc ∝ L−(1/ν+ω),

(S4)

where the constant of proportionality depends on the chosen aspect ratio r and the generally
unknown coefﬁcients of the Taylor expansion (S2). The value of the quantity A at the crossing
point is obtained by inserting δ∗ into Eq. (S2), which for both the general case κ (cid:54)= 0 and the
special case κ = 0 can be written as

A∗(L) = A(δ∗, L) = L−κ/ν(a + bL−ω + . . .),

(S5)

with some constants a and b. Thus, in principle a crossing point analysis can be used to obtain
the leading critical exponents κ and ν as well as the subleading exponent ω. However, it should
be noted that the higher-order terms in Eq. (S2) can play a signiﬁcant role for system sizes
attainable in practice, and often 1/ν + ω and ω extracted from ﬁtting to power laws according
to Eqs. (S4) and (S5) should be considered only as “effective” exponents which change with
the range of system sizes considered (with the correct exponents obtained only for very large
system sizes where the subleading corrections become negligible). To extract the critical point,
a dimensionless quantity (κ = 0) should be chosen as the convergence then is the the most rapid,
given by Eq. (S4). The value of the critical point gc obtained from ﬁtting to this functional form
is normally not very sensitive to the imperfection of the power-law correction with the effective
value of the exponent, as long as the ﬁt is statistically sound.

There are many other ways of analyzing crossing points. For instance, the exponent ν
can be obtained more directly than the difﬁcult extraction based on the correction terms in the
shift analysis above. Consider a dimensionless quantity Q, such as the Binder ratio (or the
corresponding cumulant). We then have, including also some terms of higher order in Eq. (S2),

Q(δ, L) = a0 + a1δL1/ν + a2δ2L2/ν + b1L−ω + c1δL1/ν−ω + . . . ,

and from the derivative s(δ) with respect to δ or g = gc + δ we have

s(δ) =

dQ(δ, L)

dδ

=

dQ(g, L)

dg

= a1L1/ν + c1L1/ν−ω + a2δL2/ν + . . . .

(S6)

(S7)

We will now assume that s(δ) is positive in the region of interest, and if not we redeﬁne it with
a minus sign. At δ = 0 we then have

ln[s(0)] = c +

ln(L) + dL−ω + . . . ,

ν

(S8)

with some constants c and d. Thus, for large L, ln(s) at the critical point depends linearly on
ln(L) and the slope is the exponent 1/ν. A drawback of this method for extracting ν is that the
critical point has to be determined ﬁrst, and a careful analysis should also take into account the
uncertainties in the estimated value of gc.

To circumvent the requirement of having to determine gc ﬁrst, we observe that, instead
of evaluating the derivative (S7) exactly at the critical point, we can use the crossing point
of the quantity Q for two system sizes (L1, L2) = (L, rL) [or, as in Ref. [29], one can use
L2 = L1 + ∆L with a constant ∆L, which only modiﬁes some unimportant prefactors of the
results derived below]. Inserting the crossing value (S4) of δ into (S7) we obtain

s(δ∗, Ln) = a1L1/ν

Having access to two different slopes at the crossing point, we can take the difference of the
logarithms of these and obtain

ln[s(δ∗, rL)] − ln[s(δ∗, L)] =

(S10)
with some constant e. We can therefore deﬁne an exponent estimate ν∗(L) corresponding to the
crossing point,

ln(r) + eL−ω + . . . ,

with some constant g and various higher-order terms again left out.

With all the crossing-point quantities discussed above, the inﬁnite-size values gc, Qc, and
1/ν can be obtained by ﬁtting data for several system-size pairs (L, rL), using Eqs. (S4), (S5),
and (S12). One can either use the leading form as written with only the asymptotically dominant
correction L−(1/ν+ω) (in the case of gc) or L−ω (for Qc and 1/ν) if the system sizes are large
enough for the higher-order terms to be safely neglected, or one can include higher-order terms
explicitly and ﬁt to a larger range of system sizes. The former method has the advantage of the
optimum ﬁt being easier to ﬁnd, while ﬁts with multiple power laws are some times challenging
or affected by large ﬂuctuations in the parameters unless the statistical errors are very small.

1.2 The case of two length scales
We now turn to systems with two divergent lengths, where the critical scaling is governed by
Eq. (2). When the thermodynamic limit corresponds to the scaling function f (x, y) being a

4

power of the ﬁrst argument x = δL1/ν for large x and y, the effect of the second argument
y = δL1/ν(cid:48) is the same as in the standard case of a dangerously irrelevant ﬁeld scaling as L−ω(cid:48).
The crossing-point analysis then remains the same as in the previous section. In the anomalous
case, which we have termed the super dangerous perturbation, the second scaling argument
(the longer length scale) generically controls the L → ∞ behavior and demands the modiﬁed
powers of L in front of the scaling function. This case requires some additional discussion.

In general, the scaling in this case is much more complex. In the main paper we have dis-
cussed how the correct thermodynamic limit is obtained when the scaling function is controlled
by y = δL1/ν(cid:48). This limit corresponds directly to the intuitive physical picture of the shorter
length ξ saturating at Lν/ν(cid:48) when the longer length ξ(cid:48) reaches L, and, therefore, ξ should not be
replaced by L at criticality but instead by Lν/ν(cid:48). This change imposes an anomalous power law
at criticality for any observable which can be written as some nonzero power of the correlation
length close to the critical point. It should be noted that, there are special non-generic observ-
ables, such as the Binder ratio, which by construction neither have any L-dependent prefactors
of the ﬁnite-size scaling function f nor any dependence on ξ in the thermodynamic limit (e.g.,
the Binder ratio takes constant values in the phases and a different value at the critical point).
In such non-generic cases there are also no modiﬁed power laws, since there are no powers to
be modiﬁed by the ratio ν/ν(cid:48) in the ﬁrst place. All other generic observables are expected to
develop anomalous power laws.

We next note that, in the above large L limit of f (x, y), both the arguments x = δL1/ν and
y = δL1/ν(cid:48) become large. When we are interested in crossing points close to δ = 0, we are far
from this limit, however. We can anticipate crossing points as in the single-length case when
the ﬁrst argument x is of order one (i.e., δ is of order L−1/ν), whence the second argument is
very small, y ≈ L1/ν(cid:48)−1/ν (cid:28) 1. There is no a priori reason to expect that this limit is controlled
by y. The most natural assumption, which can be tested, is that y is irrelevant in this regime.
Then we are back at a situation where the standard crossing-point analysis can be performed
and the exponent delivered by such an analysis should generically be ν, not ν(cid:48). An exception is
an observable which is manifestly dependent only on the longer length scale, in which case the
shorter length scale will play the role of an irrelevant correction. The simplest quantity of this
kind is a length scale which is proportional to the longer length ξ(cid:48) itself. In the main text we
have analyzed the size Λ of the spinon bound state and found its crossing points to be controlled
by an exponent exponent ν(cid:48) which is indeed signiﬁcantly larger than ν, and also Λ ∼ L holds
in the neighborhood of the critical point, as expected from the scaling function controlled by y
when Λ ∼ ξ(cid:48) in the thermodynamic limit.

We now have concluded that the limits of f (x, y) when y = δL1/ν(cid:48) → ∞ and y → 0 are
controlled by different exponents in the generic case; by both ν and ν(cid:48) in the former case and
only by ν in the latter case. This implies an interesting cross-over behavior between these limits.

5

In principle, such a cross-over can be tested explicitly by numerical data, by graphing results
for a wide range of system sizes and couplings (in the case of the J-Q model, that should be
done inside the VBS phase) against both δL1/ν and δL1/ν(cid:48). One should observe data collapse
onto common scaling functions in both cases, but only in the relevant regimes controlled by
the different scaling arguments; small δL1/ν or large δL1/ν(cid:48). It would clearly be desirable to
carry out such an analysis for the J-Q model, which we have not yet done due to the large
computational resources required to do this properly for sufﬁciently large system sizes. We
anticipate the analysis of the cross-over to be complicated also by the small exponent ω of the
leading scaling corrections, as demonstrated in Fig. 2 in the main paper.

Even if no tests of the cross-overs are available currently, the two limits y → 0 and y → ∞
have already been conﬁrmed in this work; the former by the scaling of the Binder cumulant
with the exponent ν (the shorter length scale) and the latter more indirectly by the presence of
anomalous powers of L. An anomalous exponent which is very well converged as a function
of the system size and completely inconsistent with any other previous scenario (neither large
scaling corrections nor a ﬁrst-order transition) is best provided by the domain-wall energy κ,
which is analyzed in Fig. 3(a) of the main paper and also further below in Sec. 2.4.

1.3 Tests on the 2D Ising model
In order to demonstrate the reliability of the method of obtaining the critical point and exponents
from crossing points, and to discuss practical issues in implementing it, we here present results
based on the Binder cumulant U of the standard 2D Ising model;

MC simulations were carried out on lattices of size L × L with periodic boundary conditions,
using a mix of Wulff and Swendsen-Wang (SW) cluster updates, with each sweep of Wulff
updates (where on average ≈ N spins are ﬂipped) followed by an SW update where the system
is decomposed into clusters, each of which is ﬂipped with probability 1/2. The SW clusters
are also used to measure (cid:104)m2(cid:105) and (cid:104)m4(cid:105) with improved estimators (after each SW update). We
carried out simulations of sizes L = 6, 7, . . . , 20, 22, . . . , 36, 40, . . . , 64, 72, . . . , 128, at 20− 30
temperatures in the neighborhood of the relevant crossing points of the Binder cumulant for
system-size pairs (L, 2L), i.e., using aspect ratio r = 2 in the expressions of Sec. 1.1. Up to
5 × 109 measurements were collected for the smaller sizes and 108 for the largest sizes.

Figure S1: Binder cumulant of the 2D Ising model with L = 16, 32, 64 in the neighborhood of
the points at which the curves cross each other. The vertical and horizontal dashed lines indicate
the critical temperature Tc and the value of the cumulant at Tc, respectively. The solid curves
are cubic polynomial ﬁts to the data sets. Error bars are much smaller than the plot symbols.

Figure S1 shows examples of data for three different system sizes, where cubic polynomials
have been ﬁtted to the data. The crossing points can be extracted numerically using bisection.
In order to analyze Tc and Uc in the thermodynamic limit, it sufﬁces to consider a small number
of points very close to each crossing point to be analyzed. To obtain ν from the slopes according
to Eq. (S11), where the derivative in Eq. (S7) is taken of the ﬁtted polynomials, it is better to
have a more extended range of points. However, for a very large range a high order of the
polynomial has to be used in order to obtain a good ﬁt, and it is then better in practice to adapt
the window size so that a relatively low order polynomial can be used. In the tests reported
here, cubic polynomials were used and all ﬁts were statistically sound.

In order to compute the statistical errors (error bars) a bootstrap method can be used, i.e., by
generating a large number of random samples of the binned MC data. Each bootstrap sample
is computed using B(L, T ) randomly chosen bins for each system size and temperature, where
B(L, T ) is also the total number of data bins available from simulations at (L, T ). The standard
deviations of the values (the horizontal and vertical crossing points and the slope estimator for
1/ν∗) computed for these bootstrap samples correspond to the error bars, which later will be
used in the ﬁts to extrapolate to inﬁnite size. In evaluating the cumulant (S13), for the full data
set or a bootstrap sample, the individual expectation values (cid:104)m2
i(cid:105) should be computed
ﬁrst based on all the bins included in the sample, after which the ratio is evaluated. If one

can be introduced in the ratio, due to nonlinear contributions to the statistical error which do
not vanish as the number of bins is increased (for ﬁxed bin size) but do decrease properly in the
bootstrap method when the sample size is increased.

We next ﬁt crossing points for a series of system pairs to the expected forms, Eqs. (S4),
√
(S5) with κ = 0, and (S12), and compare with exact and previous numerical results for the 2D
2 + 1) ≈ 2.269185314
Ising model. Onsager’s rigorous analytical solution gives Tc = 2 ln−1(
and ν = 1. The value of U at Tc is not known exactly, but Bl¨ote obtained Uc ≈ 0.916035
by extrapolating exact numerical ﬁnite-size transfer-matrix data to inﬁnite size [37]. For the
Binder cumulant the dominant subleading correction has the exponent ω = 7/4 [37]. These
results should all be obtained within statistical errors from the crossing point analysis of the MC
data if sufﬁciently large systems are used and the data are analyzed using appropriate statistical
methods. For small sizes the expected higher-order corrections will cause deviations beyond
the statistical errors from the leading-order forms, which can be detected in the goodness of the
ﬁts to the leading forms (S4), (S5), and (S12). Our strategy is to remove small system sizes
until a statistically sound ﬁt is obtained for a given quantity.

The crossing points for the different size pairs (Li, 2Li), i = 1, . . . , M, are not all statisti-
cally independent, because the same system size can appear in two different pairs. One should
therefore deﬁne the goodness of the ﬁt, χ2 per degree of freedom Ndof (the number of data
points minus the number of parameters of the ﬁt), with the full covariance matrix instead of just
its diagonal elements (which are the conventional variances). Using Vi to denote some quantity
deﬁned based on the (Li, 2Li) crossing point (the crossing temperature T ∗, the value of U∗ of
U at the crossing point, or 1/ν∗ obtained from the slopes evaluated using the ﬁtted polynomial),
we thus use

where (cid:104)Vi(cid:105) is either the mean value obtained from all available bins or an average obtained

than the standard deviation based on the bootstrap analysis), V ﬁt
is the value of the quantity
evaluated using the ﬁtted function (here a power-law correction to the inﬁnite-size value), and
M is the total number of system-size pairs used. The covariance matrix is deﬁned as

where the expectation value for each pair i, j for which Cij (cid:54)= 0 is again evaluated using boot-
strap sampling (as explained above for the error bars, which correspond to the square-roots of
the diagonal elements Cii). We use of the order 100 − 1000 bins and generate several thousand
bootstrap samples to obtain accurate estimates of the covariance matrix.

To compute error bars on the extracted quantities, we repeat the ﬁts to Eqs. (S4), (S5), and
(S12) several hundred times using the bootstrap method and deﬁne the ﬁnal means and statistical
errors (one standard deviation) using these bootstrap samples. When deﬁning χ2 as in Eq. (S15)
for data ﬁts based on bootstrap samples, the covariance matrix (S16) should be multiplied by a
factor 2, due to the two statistically equal sources of ﬂuctuations; the original MC ﬂuctuations
and those in the bootstrap samples. Then, for a statistically sound ﬁt, (cid:104)χ2(cid:105)/Ndof ≈ 1 is expected
for the bootstrap-averaged goodness of the ﬁt.

To quantitatively deﬁne a criterion for an acceptable ﬁt, we consider the standard devia-
tion of the χ2 distribution. For Ndof degrees of freedom, the standard deviation of χ2/Ndof is
(2/Ndof)1/2. We systematically eliminate the small sizes until (cid:104)χ2(cid:105)/Ndof falls roughly within
two standard deviations of its expected mean;

Clearly this criterion is sensitive to the quality of the data—if the elements of the covariance
matrix are very small, even ﬁts including only relatively large system sizes can detect the pres-
ence of higher-order corrections and not pass our test, while with noisy data also small system
sizes can be included (but the error bar on the ﬁnal extrapolated value will be larger).

If a ﬁt satisﬁes the goodness-of-ﬁt criterion (S17) it can still not be completely guaranteed
that no effects of the higher-order corrections are present in the ﬁnal result, but in general one
would expect any remaining systematical errors to be small relative to the statistical error. In
principle one can estimate the magnitude of the systematical error using the parameters obtained
from the ﬁt and some knowledge or estimate of the nature of the higher-order corrections. We
will not attempt to do that here, because in general such knowledge will be very limited. To
minimize possibly remaining systematical errors one can continue to exclude more system sizes
even after the soundness criterion (S17) is satisﬁed, at the price of increasing the statistical errors
of the parameters extracted from the ﬁts.

The above method implies a ’curse of good data’, as less data points are actually included
in the ﬁnal ﬁt when longer simulations are carried out for a ﬁxed set of system sizes. However,
the discarded data still contain valuable information on the convergence properties and can in
principle be used to analyze higher-order scaling corrections (which we do not pursue here).

Results for the horizontal (temperature) and vertical (cumulant) crossing values of the 2D
Ising model are shown in Fig. S2. For the horizontal points in (a), our ﬁts start to satisfy the
criterion (S17) when including sizes L ≥ 12 (the average goodness of the ﬁt is then (cid:104)χ2(cid:105)/Ndof ≈
1.6 with Ndof = 20) and we show that case in the ﬁgure. The ﬁt gives Tc = 2.2691855(5) and
the exponent combination 1/ν +ω = 2.674(4). Thus, the critical temperature comes out correct
within the remarkably small error bar, while 1/ν + ω is about twenty of its error bars outside the

true (asymptotic) value 1/ν + ω = 2.75. As discussed above, it is typical in ﬁnite-size scaling
that corrections-to-scaling exponents do not come out reliably until very large systems are used,
and we therefore do not consider the mismatch as a failure here, rather as a conﬁrmation of the
known fact that the exponent should be considered as an “effective exponent” which slowly
changes as larger system sizes are included.
For the crossing value of the cumulant we ﬁnd a similar trend. In this case a good ﬁt requires
that only the L ≥ 14 points are used, giving Uc = 0.916031(3) and ω = 1.667(6), again with
(cid:104)χ2(cid:105)/Ndof ≈ 1.6 (Ndof = 18). The Uc value deviates by about an error bar from Bl¨ote’s result
quoted above, while the correction exponent again is relatively far (considering the size of the
error bar) from its asymptotic value ω = 1.75. Interestingly, 1/ν extracted as the difference of
the two exponents comes out close to the correct value 1/ν = 1, within the statistical error.

The insets of Fig. S2 show the differences between the data points and the ﬁtted curves.
Here it can be seen that the points are not quite randomly distributed around 0, as they should
be if the ﬁtted functions are of the correct form. The overall shape with noisy but discernible
minimums and maximums suggests the presence of a correction which is barely detectable for
the range of system sizes at this level of statistics. One can then conclude that the deviations of
(cid:104)χ2(cid:105)/Ndof by two standard deviations from 1 in these ﬁts are not purely statistical ﬂuctuations
(which is not clear from the (cid:104)χ2(cid:105)/Ndof values alone), but due to the neglected higher-order
corrections. Nevertheless, the most important extrapolated values Tc and Uc were not adversely
affected statistically, thus demonstrating the ability of the effective exponent and the prefactor

of the correction term in Eqs. (S4) and (S5) to reproduce the overall trend of the data sufﬁciently
well for extrapolating to inﬁnite size.

To illustrate the effect of excluding even more system sizes, with the minimum size L = 28
we obtain Tc = 2.2691831(11), two error bars away from the correct value (still a statisti-
cally acceptable match), and Uc = 0.916054(11), also about two error bars from the previous
(Bl¨ote’s) value. From the Tc ﬁt we obtain 1/ν + ω = 2.70(4) in this case and from the U ﬁt
ω = 1.73(5). These exponents are now correct to within statistical errors, but the error bars are
about 10 times larger than before, while the error bars on Tc and U only doubled. The average
value of (cid:104)χ2(cid:105)/Ndof is very close to 1 for both these ﬁts and the deviations from the ﬁtted func-
tion look completely random. Upon excluding even more points, the error bars increase rapidly
but the extracted parameters remain statistically in good agreement with their correct values.

Next, we extract the exponent ν using the log-slope formula (S11). Fig. S3 shows the results
along with a ﬁt including all the system sizes (L ≥ 6). Remarkably, the ﬁt is statistically perfect,
with (cid:104)χ2(cid:105)/Ndof ≈ 1.0, already at this small minimum size and the inverse exponent extrapolates
to 1/ν = 1.0001(7), in excellent agreement with the exact result 1. The slope data are much
more noisy than the underlying U values and the error bars grow very rapidly with L for the
largest sizes. The ﬁt is therefore dominated by the smaller sizes. Naturally, the large error bars
mask the effects of higher-order corrections, as discussed above. It is nevertheless remarkable
that the extracted exponent 1/ν does not show any effects of the neglected corrections at all,
even though, again, the leading correction exponent, which comes out to ω = 1.57(7), is not

11

00.050.10.151/L0.950.960.970.980.991.001.011/ν*very close to the correct value 1.75 and its error bar is large. Again, the ﬂexibility of the leading
ﬁnite-size term allows it to mimic the effects of the correction terms without signiﬁcant effects
in the extrapolation of the ﬁt.

It should be noted that the 2D Ising model has logarithmic corrections in addition to the
higher-order scaling corrections that we have neglected here [37], which is not a generic feature
of critical points (except for systems at their upper critical dimension). The logarithms of L
multiply powers of L higher than those of the leading corrections and we therefore do not
expect them to affect the procedures used above.

These results demonstrate the unbiased nature of the crossing-point analysis when it is car-
ried out properly. We have used the same scheme to analyze the results for the J-Q model in
Fig. 2 of the main text. In the left column, the behavior of Λ/L is similar to that of U of the
Ising model in Fig. S2, with a relatively large correction exponent ω which makes the ﬁts and
extrapolations to L → ∞ stable and and visually convincing. In the right column, it is clear
that the leading correction exponent ω for R1 is small, ω < 0.5, and that there are other sig-
niﬁcant corrections present in the top two panels. The fact that the critical point nevertheless
agrees perfectly to within small error bars with that extracted from the spinon bound state is
very reassuring. As in the Ising model, the ﬁt to 1/ν∗ only requires a single scaling correction,
though it can not be excluded that this correction is an effective one, mimicking the collective
effects of several corrections with the same sign. In any case, the extrapolations are stable, e.g.,
excluding some of the small-L points does not dramatically change the extrapolation, though of
course the error bar grows.

We advocate the systematic curve-crossing method as outlined above to determine the crit-
ical temperature (or critical coupling of a quantum phase transition) and the critical exponents,
instead of often used [also in DQC studies [15, 20, 22]] data-collapse techniques where many
choices have to be made, concerning the range of data included, use of corrections, etc. Al-
though trends when increasing the system size can also be studied with data collapse [as done
in Ref. [20])], the solid grounding of the present scheme directly to the ﬁnite-size scaling form
(S1) makes it the preferred method.

2 Domain-wall energy
As we discussed in the main text, the fundamental longer length scale ξ(cid:48) in the DQC theory
is the thickness of a domain wall in the VBS. In Fig. S4 we illustrate a generic domain wall
in a 2D system in which a discrete symmetry is broken. In the case of a broken continuous
symmetry, e.g., the magnetization vector in the XY spin model, there is no domain wall but the
order parameter (its direction) gradually twists uniformly over the entire width L of the system.
This case will be discussed in Sec. 3 in the context of a twist of the N´eel order parameter of

12

Figure S4: A domain wall in a generic 2D system where a discrete order parameter is locked at
different values (directions) to the left and right and the twist between the two directions takes
place over a region (domain-wall) of thickness ξ(cid:48).

the J-Q model. For a discrete broken symmetry it is energetically favorable for the system to
instead restrict the size of the region (the domain wall) over which the order parameter deviates
signiﬁcantly from the values imposed at the boundaries. Note, however, that the domain wall is
not strictly ﬁxed at some location, and, e.g., in an MC simulation the local order parameter will
not detect the intrinsic width of a domain wall, because averaging is performed over all locations
of the wall. Therefore, other means have to be employed to detect the intrinsic domain-wall
thickness, e.g., using suitably deﬁned correlation functions.

As we showed in the main text, the length scale ξ(cid:48) is conveniently present in the J-Q model
in the ﬁnite-size scaling of the energy density κ of a VBS domain wall. Here, in Sec. 2.1 we
derive the scaling form of κ, in the thermodynamic limit and for ﬁnite system size, using a
simple Ansatz generalizing the treatment by Fisher et al. [1] in a different context (considered
further in Sec. 3) to the case of discrete symmetry breaking with two divergent length scales.
The formalism applies both to classical and quantum systems. We present our MC procedures
to compute κ at classical (thermal) phase transitions, using the 2D Ising model as a concrete
example in Sec. 2.2. We also present results for the 3D classical six-state clock model at its
critical temperature in Sec. 2.3, before describing the details of the QMC calculations of κ for
the J-Q model at T = 0 in Sec. 2.4.

2.1 Scaling forms
Let us ﬁrst consider the case of a d-dimensional system with single divergent length scale ξ ∝
δ−ν. Following Fisher et al. [1], we consider the singular part of the free-energy density, which
we can write for a classical system at ﬁnite temperature or a quantum system at T = 0 (in which
case the free energy is just the ground state energy) as

fs(δ, L) ∝ δν(d+z)Y (ξ/L) ∝ ξ−(d+z)Y (ξ/L),

(S18)

13

where formally the dynamic exponent z = 0 for a classical system. Introducing a domain wall,
the free-energy difference with respect to the system without domain wall should scale in a
similar way but with a different size-dependent function [1];
∆fs(δ, L) ∝ ξ−(d+z) ˜Y (ξ/L).

(S19)

This density should be understood as a quantity averaged over the inhomogeneous system (or,
equivalently, in a ﬁnite system the domain wall location is not ﬁxed and all properties are aver-
ages over all locations of the domain wall), and the total free-energy difference is

∆Fs(δ, L) ∝ ξ−(d+z) ˜Y (ξ/L)Ld,

(S20)

where Ld is the volume of the system.

We can also write down a different expression for the free-energy difference, by explicitly
considering the cost of twisting the order parameter. If the domain wall has width ξ and the
total twist of the order parameter across the wall is ∆φ, then the cost per lattice link inside the
wall is ρ(∆φ/ξ)2, which also deﬁnes the stiffness constant ρ. Outside the wall region the local
energy cost vanishes, and, since the total volume occupied by the domain wall is ∝ ξLd−1 we
have

∆Fs(δ, L) ∝ ρ(∆φ)2ξ−1Ld−1.

(S21)

Consistency in the L dependence between this expression and Eq. (S20) requires that the scaling
function has the form ˜Y ∝ ξ/L, and therefore

(S22)
The domain wall energy per generalized cross-section area Ld−1 of the wall (its length for d = 2,
area for d = 3, etc.) is then

∆Fs(δ, L) ∝ ξ−(d+z−1)Ld−1.

κ =

∆Fs

Ld−1 ∝ 1

ξd+z−1 ,

(S23)

which no longer has any L dependence and, thus, represents the behavior in the thermodynamic
limit. We can also read off the scaling of the stiffness constant,
ρ ∝ ξ−(d+z−2) ∝ δν(d+z−2),

(S24)

by comparing Eqs. (S21). and (S22).

Since we have written all expressions in terms of the correlation length, we can now switch
to ﬁnite-size scaling at a critical point by simply making the substitution ξ → L. For the domain
wall energy (S23) of interest here we obtain

κ(L) ∝ L−(d+z−1).

14

(S25)

Now consider a system with two length scales, with a conventional correlation length ξ ∼
δ−ν and a domain wall thickness ξ(cid:48) ∼ δ−ν(cid:48), with ν(cid:48) > ν. A simple generalization of Eq. (S20)
suggests that

∆Fs(δ, L) ∝ ξ−(d+z) ˜Y (ξ/L, ξ(cid:48)/L)Ld.

(S26)
Note that only the shorter length scale should appear in front of the size-dependent scaling
function ˜Y because the free energy in the thermodynamic limit should only depend on the two
lengths in an additive way, fs = aξ−(d+z) + bξ(cid:48)−(d+z), in order for the speciﬁc-heat exponent
(α) relation 2 − α = ν(d + z) to hold, i.e., for hyper-scaling to apply (which we thus assume).
Since ξ diverges slower than ξ(cid:48), fs is asymptotically dominated by the ξ term, and (S26) should
then describe the leading singular behavior.

We can also easily generalize Eq. (S21) to a domain wall of thickness ξ(cid:48);

(S27)
Now consistency between Eqs. (S26) and (S27) for both the L dependence and the ξ(cid:48) depen-
dence requires that ˜Y ∝ (L/ξ(cid:48))(ξ2/L2), and we arrive at

∆Fs(δ, L) = ρ(∆φ)2ξ(cid:48)−1Ld−1.

κ ∝

1

ξd+z−2ξ(cid:48)

(S28)

for the scaling of κ in the thermodynamic limit. Note the consistency of this form and the
single-length form (S23) when ξ(cid:48) → ξ. In the particular case of a DQC point (d = 2, z = 1),
Eq. (S28) reduces to κ ∝ (ξξ(cid:48))−1, which was derived in a different way by Senthil et al. [4].

To convert Eq. (S28) to ﬁnite-size scaling, in the standard treatment of two length scales
arising from a dangerously irrelevant perturbation [31], the longer scale is not present in the
leading ﬁnite-size scaling behavior. This can be understood physically as follows: Upon ap-
proaching the critical point from the ordered phase, when ξ(cid:48) reaches L we simply replace ξ(cid:48) by
L. However, ξ continues to grow and controls the scaling behavior until it reaches L. At the
critical point also ξ is replaced by L, and the critical ﬁnite-size scaling of κ obtained from (S28)
is, thus, identical to the single-length form (S25). Since neither ν nor ν(cid:48) appear here, there is no
information on these exponents in the ﬁnite-size scaling of κ in the standard scenario.

As we argued in the main text, there is also another possibility, namely, the growth of ξ in

Eq. (S28) is halted when ξ(cid:48) reaches L. Then ξ ∝ Lν/ν(cid:48), leading to the ﬁnite-size scaling

κ(L) ∝ L−1−(d+z−2)ν/ν(cid:48)

(S29)
In the case of DQC, this reduces to κ ∝ L−(1+ν/ν(cid:48)). It is very interesting that the ratio ν/ν(cid:48)
appears here in a simple way and can be extracted using critical ﬁnite-size scaling. The result in
Fig. 3(a) leaves little doubt that κ < 2, which represents unambiguous evidence for anomalous
scaling in the J-Q model. Below, in Sec. 2.4, we will present details of these calculations, along
with additional results showing that ν/ν(cid:48) ≈ 0.72 for the J-Q model.

black open circles and red ﬁlled circles indicate down and up boundary spins, respectively. The
vertical location r denotes the point at which the domain-wall inducing boundary is terminated.
This location is updated, r → r ± 1, in MC updates in addition to the updates of the bulk spins.
A full vertical domain wall is present when r = L.

2.2 2D Ising model
It is instructive to ﬁrst test the domain-wall scaling using a simple system such as the 2D Ising
model. A domain wall in the ferromagnet can be enforced in different ways using suitable
boundary conditions. Here we use L × L systems with periodic boundaries in the y-direction
and compare two different x boundaries, as illustrated in Fig. S5. The boundaries are open,
with the edge columns coupled with the same strength J as the bulk coupling to ﬁxed spins
σi = +1 and σi = −1, equivalent to boundary ﬁelds of strength ±J. Here the domain-wall
imposing column of spins to the right extends only partially through the system, to illustrate the
mechanism we use for computing the required free-energy difference.

It is not easy to compute the free energy in MC simulations, but it is relatively easy to
compute a free-energy difference, if the two systems of interest, let us call them “1” and “2”,
can be simulated collectively as a partition function Z12 = Z1 + Z2.
If there are updates
switching the simulation between system states 1 and 2 with detailed balance satisﬁed, then
the free-energy difference ∆F21 = F2 − F1 = ln(Z2/Z1) = ln(P2/P1), where P1, P2 are the
probabilities of the simulation “visiting” the respective states. Such multi-canonical simulations
[38] can be extended to an arbitrary number of systems s = 1, . . . , n, and any ∆Fij can then be
accessed, provided that the simulation can easily transition between the different states s.

In the studies of domain walls considered here, the different systems correspond to boundary
conditions ﬂuctuating between the normal periodic boundaries and the domain-wall boundaries.
To enhance the ability of the system to ﬂuctuate between these boundary conditions of interest,
the whole boundary is not changed at once, but in small steps where the right boundary has a
change from σi = −1 to σi = +1 at some vertical location y = r, as illustrated in Fig. S5. Thus,
r = 0 corresponds to the normal periodic boundaries (no domain wall) and r = L corresponds
to the boundary enforcing a full vertical domain wall. For 0 < r < L the domain wall does
not extend vertically through the whole system and instead has a horizontal part connecting to

the location y = r where the boundary changes. MC updates are used to move this location,
r → r ± 1, using heat-bath acceptance probabilities.

We ﬁnd that the probability P (r) of the boundary conditions generated is the highest, as
expected, for r = 0. There is also a local maximum at r = L, and a minimum around r = L/2.
To further increase the efﬁciency of the boundary moves, a weight factor V (r) is multiplied with
the Boltzmann probability for the spins and gradually adjusted until the histogram H(r) of the
relative number of times the boundary is at r becomes almost ﬂat. Then, the actual probability
without the re-weighting factor is P (r) = H(r)/V (r), and the free-energy difference between
the systems with and without domain wall is (leaving out the unimportant temperature factor),

on the basis of size pairs (L, 2L) by postulating κ(L) = aL−(L) and κ(2L) = a(2L)−(L),
whence (L) = ln[κ(L)/κ(2L)]/ ln(2). The results are fully compatible with (L) → 1 when
L → ∞, as predicted by Eq. (S25) when d = 2, z = 0, with a correction ∝ L−1. We have also
carried out simulations of the 3D Ising model and conﬁrmed that (L) → 2.

2.3 3D clock model
The existence of two length scales in the DQC theory relies heavily [3, 4] on an analogy with the
classical 3D clock model, where the standard XY model is deformed by an external potential
h cos (qΘi) for all the angles Θi. This term is known to act as a dangerously-irrelevant perturba-
tion, leading to a domain-wall thickness ξ(cid:48) > ξ. It is therefore natural to also test the scaling of
the domain-wall energy in this case. Here we use the standard XY interaction between nearest
neighbors on the 3D simple cubic lattice

HXY = −J

cos(Θi − Θj),

(S31)

(cid:88)

(cid:104)ij(cid:105)

where the angles are constrained to the q clock angles, Θi = n2π/q, n = 0, 1, . . . , q − 1. The
hard constraint is equivalent to the limit h/J → ∞ with the cosine perturbation.

The exponent ν(cid:48) should be independent of h/J (including the fully-constrained limit consid-
ered here) but depends on q, diverging as q → ∞. There has been some controversy regarding
methods to compute the exponent in MC simulations, as summarized in the recent Ref. [31],
but for small q several calculations are nevertheless in good agreement with each other and we
can use them as reference points.

In order for the exponent ratio ν/ν(cid:48) to be signiﬁcantly different from one we here use q = 6,

18

0.111/L10-310-210-1κ00.10.21/L1.41.61.82.0εin which case ν(cid:48) ≈ 1.44 and, since the 3D XY exponent ν ≈ 0.67, the ratio ν/ν(cid:48) ≈ 0.47.
Results for the domain-wall energy scaling at the critical point are shown in Fig. S7. The results
are completely consistent with the form (S25) with d = 3, z = 0, corresponding to the expected
standard scenario where ﬁnite-size scaling is obtained from the thermodynamic-limit form by
replacing both divergent length scales by L. The results are completely inconsistent with the
alternative scenario (S29), where the decay exponent should approach 1 + ν/ν(cid:48) ≈ 1.47. This
result reinforces the unusual form of the scaling of κ in the J-Q model, Fig. 3(a) of the main
text, which we will discuss in more detail in the next section.

We also comment on the applicability of the generic two-length scaling form (2) in the main

paper to κ in the clock model. Using the ﬁnite-size scaling we found above, we should have

).

κ(δ, L) = L−2f (δL1/ν, δL1/ν(cid:48)

(S32)
To obtain the correct thermodynamic limit, κ → (ξξ(cid:48))−1 when L → ∞, we must have f (x, y) →
xνyν(cid:48), which is also natural because, given the form in the thermodynamic limit, f should be
separable, f (x, y) = fx(x)fy(y), where the two factors just correspond to the expected scaling
forms for the length scales ξ and ξ(cid:48) themselves. In contrast, in the J-Q model we have argued
for an anomalous form which corresponds to a generally non-separable scaling function with
the thermodynamic limit controlled only by the second argument.

2.4 J-Q model
In the J-Q model we are interested in ground state energies of systems with and without domain
walls and these can be computed in standard QMC simulations. The multi-canonical approach
employed in the previous section, developed to circumvent the difﬁculties of MC calculations of
individual free energies at T > 0, are therefore neither useful nor needed. We use the projector
QMC approach with e−βH applied to a valence-bond trial state of the amplitude-product type
[39, 40], choosing the “projection time” β sufﬁciently large, up to β = 4L, to converge the
ground-state energy. Domain walls are introduced by boundary conditions in two different
ways, schematically illustrated in Fig. S8.

The VBS order parameter is a vector D = (Dx, Dy), where the operators corresponding to

the two components can be deﬁned as

boundary conditions of these two cases are denoted as (h, v1) and (v2, v1). In QMC simulations

thus explicitly breaking the symmetry between the possible VBS patterns. Periodic boundary
conditions are employed in the y direction.

magnitude D of the order parameter. These peaks correspond to angles mπ/2, m = 0, 1, 2, 3.
As the critical point is approached, in simulations of the J-Q model the histograms develop an
U (1) symmetry, becoming completely circular symmetric at the DQC point [15, 17]. The length
scale ξ(cid:48) controls this emergent U (1) symmetry [3]; upon course-graining the order parameter on
length scales larger than ξ(cid:48) the discrete Z4 symmetry of the VBS is apparent, while on shorter
length-scales U (1) symmetry develops. The thickness of a domain wall forced by suitable
boundary conditions is controlled by this same length scale.

The four-fold symmetry of the VBS on the square lattice allows for two different types of
boundary conditions, as illustrated in Fig. S8. In the case labeled n = 1, the left and right sides
of the lattice are forced to have VBS order with horizontal and vertical dimers, respectively,
which corresponds to an angular difference of the order parameter ∆φ = π/2. In the n = 2
graph, there is vertical dimer order at both edges, but with a relative shift of one lattice spacing,
corresponding to an angular mismatch of ∆φ = π. In a large system, the elementary domain
wall corresponds to ∆φ = π/2 and a π wall splits into two such elementary walls.

To compare the two cases and check for possible effects of interactions between two domain
walls on the scaling of the energy, we have carried out projector QMC simulations with domain
walls induced with total twist angles ∆φ = π/2 and π. Simulations without domain walls were
carried out with similar boundary conditions, but with both the left and right walls at the same
VBS angle φ. The energy differences can then be computed without any remaining effects of
edge contributions to the total energy, which for a given type of edge is the same with and
without domain walls present in the bulk. Denoting boundary conditions enforcing horizontal
dimerization at one of the edges (as in the left edge of the n = 1 graph in Fig. S8) by h and
vertical order with the two different phases (as shown in the n = 2 graph) by v1 and v2, the
systems we study with different combinations of left and right boundaries are (h, h), (v1, v1),
(h,v1), and (v2, v1). The v1 and v2 boundaries are related by just a translation and therefore the

edge contribution to the energy from these are the same. The domain wall contributions to the
energy with the edge effects eliminated are then

∆E(π) = E(v2, v1) − E(v1, v1),

and the corresponding size-normalized energy density is κ(∆φ) = ∆E(∆φ)/L.

QMC results for κ computed at the estimated critical point J/Q = 0.0447 are shown in
Fig. S9(a) [where the κ = π results are the same as those already presented in Fig. 3(a)]. Here, to
compare the energies on an equal footing, we divide κ by the number n = 1, 2 of domain walls
induced when the VBS twist angle is ∆φ = nπ/2 and plot the results against (L/n)−1, L/n
being the width over which a single domain wall is (on average) distributed. It is interesting,
and at ﬁrst sight surprising, that the π/2 domain wall is energetically much more expensive,
since one would not expect any signiﬁcant attractive interactions between the two domain walls
in the ∆φ = π case. We ﬁnd that the lowering of the energy is due to enhanced ﬂuctuations
in the system with two domain walls. Recalling the emergent U (1) symmetry discussed above
and considering a π/2 domain wall between, say, boundaries at φ = 0 and φ = π/2, we expect
the VBS angle in the center of the system to ﬂuctuate mainly between these angles. In the case
of the ∆φ = π twist, there are similarly ﬂuctuations between the angles at the edge, say φ = 0
and φ = π, but here the system has two possible paths to go between the edges, passing either
through φ = π/2 or φ = −π/2. Since the system is critical, there is no reason to expect any
breaking of this symmetry.

moderate system sizes, while for larger systems the amplitude of the order parameter is reduced
due to the critical nature of the domain walls and the histograms in both cases develop U (1)
symmetry. These results conﬁrm that the system with π twist is “softer” than that with ∆φ =
π/2, explaining the large overall differences between the n = 1 and n = 2 results in Fig. S9(a).
Apart from the different overall magnitudes, the power-law decay of κ with L for the largest
systems is similar for n = 1 and 2. Fig. S9(b) shows the running exponents (L) extracted from
system sizes (L, 2L) in the same way as discussed in Sec. 2.2 for the Ising model and Sec. 2.3
for the clock model. The two data sets asymptotically extrapolate to the same exponent, which
we have argued is 1 + ν/ν(cid:48), with ν/ν(cid:48) = 0.715(15). The corrections are perfectly captured by
a power-law term ∝ L−ω with the same exponent ω ≈ 1.2 − 1.3 for n = 1 and 2 but different
signs of the prefactor. We have also carried out calculations slightly away from the estimated
critical coupling, at J/Q = 0.0450 and 0.0445, and there are no signiﬁcant differences in the
exponent ratio extracted at these points.

These results are key to our claims of anomalous ﬁnite-size scaling in the J-Q model, as it
is not possible to explain a non-integer decay exponent  < 2 for the domain walls within the
conventional quantum-criticality scenario (as discussed above in Sec. 2.1), and the results also
are completely inconsistent with a ﬁrst-order transition. In the latter case, VBS and N´eel order
would coexist at the transition point and a domain wall induced in the way explained above
could possibly also be affected by coexistence inside the domain wall. However, regardless of
the nature of the domain wall, the energy cost of the interface must scale linearly with the length
of the domain wall, giving a ﬁnite κ and a vanishing exponent (L) when L → ∞. This seems
extremely unlikely, given our data in Fig. S9(b).

In Ref. [40] we employed a different approach to studying domain walls in periodic systems,
by restricting the trial state used in projector QMC simulations in the valence-bond basis to a
topological (winding number) sector corresponding to the presence of a given number of domain
walls. We found anomalous scaling for κ, but with a somewhat larger exponent ratio ν/ν(cid:48) =
0.80(1), for a different variant of the J-Q model with products of three singlet projectors (the
J-Q3 model) instead of the two projectors used in the model (3) (the J-Q2 model). We have also
repeated this kind of calculation for the J-Q2 model and again found ν/ν(cid:48) ≈ 0.80 for systems
of small and moderate size. However, when larger systems are considered and the statistical
accuracy is sufﬁciently high, drifts in the exponent toward smaller values become apparent.
The asymptotic behavior is consistent with ν/ν(cid:48) ≈ 0.72 obtained above with the symmetry-
breaking boundaries. The previous results in Ref. [40] were likely affected in the same way by
remaining scaling corrections, and ν/ν(cid:48) ≈ 0.72 should hold universally for different variants of
the J-Q model and for different ways of generating domain walls.

3 Finite-size scaling of the spin stiffness and susceptibility

In the main text we discussed the generic two-length ﬁnite-size scaling form (2) and its different
limiting behaviors compatible with the correct scaling of physical quantities in the thermody-
namic limit. Here we discuss the behavior in the thermodynamic limit further, deriving the
standard forms assumed in the main text for the spin stiffness ρs and the susceptibility χ in the
presence of two divergent length scales. We then argue for the unconventional size scaling. The
scaling arguments generalize similar treatments by Fisher et al. [1] for a system with a single
divergent length scale to a quantum phase transition with two divergent length scales, in a way
analogous to the treatment of the domain-wall energy in the previous section.

The standard scenario of Fisher et al. [1] was formulated for interacting bosons and gives
the scaling behaviors of the superﬂuid stiffness and the compressibility. The same formalism
applies to a spin system as well [2], where the corresponding quantities are the spin stiffness ρs
and uniform magnetic susceptibility χ, which we will use in the notation here. As in Sec. 2, we
again start from the singular part of the free-energy density,

fs(δ, L, β) ∝ δν(d+z)Y (ξ/L, ξz/β),

(S36)

where we now explicitly include the dependence on the inverse temperature β, which was as-
sumed to be zero in the case of the quantum system (z > 0) in Sec. 2. In the end we will
consider β → ∞ but we will need ﬁnite β in the derivation of the susceptibility.

Upon imposing, by suitable boundary conditions, a total spatial phase twist ∆φ of the con-
tinuous N´eel order parameter uniformly distributed over the system, the increase in free energy
is given by

∆fs(δ, L, β) = ρs

(∆φ)2

L2 ∝ δν(d+z) ˜Yr(ξ/L, ξz/β).

(S37)

(S38)

Internal consistency of this scaling form demands that ˜Yr behaves as (ξ/L)2, thus,

ρs ∝ ξ2δν(d+z) ∝ δν(d+z−2).

Similarly, χ(∆φ)2/β2 is the excess energy density needed to enforce a twist between τ = 0 and
τ = β in the imaginary-time direction;

∆fs(δ, L, β) = χ

(∆φ)2

β2 ∝ δν(d+z) ˜Yτ (ξ/L, ξz/β),

where ˜Yτ has to behave as (ξz/β)2. Thus, the susceptibility scales as

χ ∝ ξ2zδν(d+z) ∝ δν(d−z).

23

(S39)

(S40)

The ﬁnite-size scaling properties at the critical point are simply obtained from Eqs. (S38) and
(S40) by replacing δ−ν ∝ ξ by the system length L, leading to
ρs ∝ L−(d+z−2), χ ∝ L−(d−z).

(S41)
In the case of z = 1 (as in the DQC theory) both quantities scale as 1/L but note that the
dependence on z is opposite for the two, which implies that the behavior seen in Fig. 3 in the
main text can not be explained simply by z (cid:54)= 1.

We now generalize the above derivations to the case of two divergent length-scales, ξ and

ξ(cid:48), writing the free energy density as

fs(δ, L, β) ∝ δν(d+z)Y (ξ/L, ξz/β, ξ(cid:48)/L, ξ(cid:48)z/β),

(S42)
where we have made the assumption that the same dynamic exponent governs the two time
scales associated with ξ and ξ(cid:48) (and in principle we can generalize to two different exponents z
and z(cid:48)). The excess energy due to a spatial twist is

∆fs(δ, L, β) = ρs

(∆φ)2

L2 ∝ δν(d+z) ˜Yr(ξ/L, ξz/β, ξ(cid:48)/L, ξ(cid:48)z/β).

(S43)

Here, at ﬁrst sight, there are many ways in which ˜Yr can depend on its arguments in order to
contain the correct L dependence;

(cid:32) ξ

(cid:33)a(cid:32) ξ(cid:48)

(cid:33)2−a

˜Yr ∝

L

L

,

(S44)

with arbitrary exponent a. However, upon approaching the critical point, when the longer length
reaches L, we have ξ(cid:48)/L ≈ 1 and the only dependence on L at that point is in the factor (ξ/L)a.
Thus, we can argue that a = 2. For the thermodynamic limit we therefore reproduce the
standard results, Eq. (S38). In a similar way we also reproduce Eq. (S40) for the susceptibility.
For the ﬁnite-size scaling there are two physically natural options, following from two pos-
sible behaviors of the shorter length scale ξ upon further approaching the critical point when
ξ(cid:48) has already reached L: (i) ξ continues to increase and eventually reaches L. The standard
ﬁnite-size scaling forms (S41) are then again obtained by replacing ξ ∝ δ−ν by L. (ii) The two
length scales are fundamentally tied together, and once ξ(cid:48) has saturated ξ is locked into its cor-
responding value; ξ ∝ (ξ(cid:48))ν/ν(cid:48) ∝ Lν/ν(cid:48). Making this replacement in the thermodynamic-limit
forms (S38) and (S40) leads to

ρs ∝ L−(d+z−2)ν/ν(cid:48)

, χ ∝ L−(d−z)ν/ν(cid:48)

(S45)
exactly as we argued in the main text based on a direct ﬁnite-size scaling ansatz with an appro-
priate limit of the scaling function. As was shown in Fig. 3 in the main text, the forms (S45) are
in excellent qualitative agreement with data for the J-Q model, with both ρs and χ decreasing
slower with L than in the standard forms (S41). Quantitative agreement is observed when using
the exponent ratio ν/ν(cid:48) extracted from the scaling of the domain-wall energy.

4 Anomalous critical scaling at ﬁnite temperature

One of the experimentally most important aspects of quantum criticality is that the quantum-
critical point at T = 0 governs the behavior also in a wide T > 0 region which expands out from
(gc, T = 0) with increasing T —the so-called quantum-critical fan. In the standard scenario [2],
the correlation length exactly at gc diverges when T → 0 as ξT ∝ T −1/z and the uniform
magnetic susceptibility approaches 0 as χT ∝ T d/z−1. These forms are not seen in simulations
of the J-Q model in the neighborhood of its critical point, however [18, 30].

Given our ﬁndings where the ratio ν/ν(cid:48) modiﬁes the standard power laws in ﬁnite-size scal-
ing, it is also natural to expect modiﬁcations of the powers of the temperature for the system in
the thermodynamic limit. This expectation follows from the Euclidean path-integral mapping,
where the inverse temperature 1/T of a d-dimensional system corresponds to the thickness in
the imaginary-time dimension of the (d + 1)-dimensional effective system (LT = c/T , c be-
ing velocity of the critical excitations). Finite-temperature scaling is therefore obtained as a
generalized ﬁnite-size scaling in LT [2].

We here re-analyze the critical J-Q data of Ref. [30] to test whether power laws modiﬁed
by ν/ν(cid:48) can explain the observed scaling anomalies. The data were generated in Ref. [30] using
QMC calculations on L × L lattices with L up to 512, which allowed for studies effectively
in the thermodynamic limit down to temperatures T /Q ≈ 0.035 (L/LT (cid:29) 1). Given that the
correlation length diverges faster than expected and the susceptibility approaches 0 slower than
expected, in Fig. S10 we test the forms

ξT ∝ T −1/(zν/ν(cid:48))(1 + aT ωξ),
χT ∝ T (d/z−1)ν/ν(cid:48)
(1 + bT ωχ),

(S46)
(S47)
using d = 2, z = 1, ν/ν(cid:48) = 0.715 and positive correction exponents ωξ, ωχ. The correction
terms reﬂect expected non-asymptotic contributions which become unimportant when T → 0
but still affect the behavior for the temperatures reached in the simulations. We have multiplied
ξT by T in Fig. S10(a) and divided χT by T in Fig. S10(b), so that the results graphed versus
1/T should approach constants if the conventional forms ξT ∝ 1/T and χT ∝ T hold. The
data agree very well with the proposed anomalous forms, lending support to our hypothesis
that ﬁnite-size anomalies carry over also to T > 0 scaling with the same exponent ratio ν/ν(cid:48)
modifying the power laws.

In Ref. [30] the scaling anomaly in the correlation length was used as input in a simple pic-
ture of a deconﬁned gas of spinons, leading to quantitatively consistents relationships between
numerical results for ξT , χT , and the speciﬁc heat (the latter of which we do not analyze here be-
cause its anomalies are very difﬁcult to detect). Within the spinon gas picture the susceptibility
was predicted to acquire a multiplicative logarithmic correction. The present scenario strongly

Figure S10: Finite-temperature scaling in the critical J-Q model based on QMC results from
Ref. [30]. The data are analyzed using the forms (S46) and (S47) with d = 2, z = 1, and
the ratio ν/ν(cid:48) = 0.715 determined previously. In (a) the correlation length has been multiplied
by T and in (b) the susceptibility has been divided by T , so that conventional quantum-critical
scaling demands the results to approach constants when 1/T → ∞. The ﬁts shown here gave
the correction exponents ωξ ≈ 0.40 and ωχ ≈ 0.55 in Eqs. (S46) and (S47).

suggests a modiﬁed power law instead of a logarithm, but the consistent behaviors of the three
quantities found in Ref. [30] still hold numerically within the temperature regime considered
(since the data ﬁts work).

Since the spinons at the critical point are not completely free particles in the DQC theory
[3, 4] one cannot expect the free spinon-gas picture to remain strictly correct down to T → 0,
but it appears to apply in a window of rather low temperatures, where the log-form used for the
susceptibility in Ref. [30] can not be distingushed from the modiﬁed power-law form proposed
here. It would be interesting to carry out simulations at still lower temperatures, to study how
the logarithmic ﬁt to χT /T presumably breaks down eventually and test further the anomalous
power laws where the correction terms in Eqs. (S46) and (S47) become inigniﬁcant.

5 Quantum Monte Carlo simulations

The QMC calculations of the spin stiffness and susceptibility were carried out with the standard
Stochastic Series Expansion algorithm, using the same program as in Ref. [18], to which we
refer for technical details and further references. For a given system size, the method produces
unbiased results only affected by well-characterized statistical errors of the MC sampling.

Ground-state calculations in both the S = 0 and S = 1 sector were carried out with projector
QMC simulations in the basis of valence bonds (singlet pairs) and unpaired spins, following

S, there are (N − 2S)/2 valence bonds and 2S unpaired spins with the same z-spin projection,
i.e., the total spin-z projection of the state Sz = S. The degrees of freedom of a bra and ket
state are importance-sampled, using the overlap of the two states as the sampling weight. This
overlap is represented by a transition graph, where, in the case of the ground state with S = 0,
the bonds form closed loops. For S > 0 there are 2S “open loops”, or strings, where for a
given string the end points fall on two unpaired spins, one in the bra and one in the ket. Such a
conﬁguration for S = 1 is illustrated in Fig. 1 of the main text.

This string connecting an unpaired spin in the bra and ket states is a representation of a
spinon. The statistics of the individual strings and their cross-correlations provide information
on the nature of the spinons and their collective states. In particular, the size of the lowest-
energy S = 1 spinon bound state in a VBS can be deﬁned in simulations with two unpaired
spins. In Ref. [34] the distance between the unpaired spins (the end points of the strings) were
used for this purpose. Here we use a slightly different measure, inspired by the arguments of
Ref. [35] for a different problem, using the entire strings in the following way [41]: Each of
the two spinons, 1, and 2, in the S = 1 state is associated with a string covering lattices sites
located at r1(i), r2(j), with i = 1, . . . , n1 and j = 1, . . . , n2. We average the distance-squared
ij = |(cid:126)r1(i) − (cid:126)r2(j)|2 between two points on the two strings over all the n1n2 pairs of lattice
r2
sites covered by the strings,

and deﬁne the size as Λ = (cid:104)r2(cid:105)1/2. We ﬁnd that this deﬁnition provides a clearer signal of the
spinon bound state diverging faster than the correlation length than deﬁnitions of Λ based on
just the unpaired spins used in Refs. [33, 34].
