ABSTRACT

Nearly all the star clusters with ages of ∼1-2 Gyr in both Magellanic Clouds exhibit an
extended main-sequence turn oﬀ (eMSTO) whose origin is under debate. The main scenarios
suggest that the eMSTO could be either due to multiple generations of stars with diﬀerent
ages or to coeval stellar populations with diﬀerent rotation rates.

In this paper we use Hubble-Space-Telescope images to investigate the ∼80-Myr old clus-
ter NGC 1755 in the LMC. We ﬁnd that the MS is split with the blue and the red MS hosting
about the 25% and the 75% of the total number of MS stars, respectively. Moreover, the
MSTO of NGC 1755 is broadened in close analogy with what is observed in the ∼300-Myr-
old NGC 1856 and in most intermediate-age Magellanic-Cloud clusters. We demonstrate that
both the split MS and the eMSTO are not due to photometric errors, ﬁeld-stars contamina-
tion, diﬀerential reddening, or non-interacting binaries. These ﬁndings make NGC 1755 the
youngest cluster with an eMSTO.

We compare the observed CMD with isochrones and conclude that observations are not
consistent with stellar populations with diﬀerence in age, helium, or metallicity only. On the
contrary, the split MS is well reproduced by two stellar populations with diﬀerent rotation,
although the ﬁt between the observed eMSTO and models with diﬀerent rotation is not fully
satisfactory.

We speculate whether all stars in NGC 1755 were born rapidly rotating, and a fraction
has slowed down on a rapid timescale, or the dichotomy in rotation rate was present already
at star formation. We discuss the implication of these ﬁndings on the interpretation of eMSTO
in young and intermediate-age clusters.

1 INTRODUCTION

Several studies have revealed that most Globular Clusters (GCs)
with ages of ∼1-2 Gyr in both Magellanic Clouds (MCs) exhibit ei-
ther a bimodal or extended main-sequence turn-oﬀ (hereafter eM-
STO, Bertelli et al. 2003; Mackey & Broby Nielsen 2007; Glatt
et al. 2009; Milone et al. 2009; Correnti et al. 2014; Goudfrooij et
al. 2014). This feature of the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) has
suggested that eMSTO GCs have experienced a prolonged star-
formation history with a duration of ∼100-500 Myrs (e.g. Mackey
et al. 2008; Rubele et al. 2013; Goudfrooij et al. 2011) and that
these clusters could be the younger counterparts of the old Galac-
tic GCs with multiple populations (Keller et al. 2011; Conroy &
Spergel 2011). The possibility that intermediate-age GCs host mul-
tiple stellar populations with diﬀerent ages has been further sup-

ported by the presence of either extended or dual red clumps that
indicate that these stellar systems are not consistent with a single
isochrone (Girardi et al. 2009). An alternative scenario has been
proposed by Bastian & De Mink (2009) who have suggested that
the eMSTO is due to stellar rotations in clusters where a single
stellar generation exists (see Goudfrooij et al. 2014, Niederhofer et
al. 2015 and references therein for discussions). Yang et al. (2011)
have suggested merged binary systems and interacting binaries
with mass transfer can be responsible for both the eMSTO and the
dual clumps.

More recently, an eMSTO has been detected for the ﬁrst time
in the ∼300-Myr old cluster NGC 1856 in the LMC by Milone et
al. (2015) who have provided the ﬁrst evidence that this CMD fea-
ture is not a peculiarity of intermediate-age clusters (see also Cor-

2

A. P. Milone et al.

renti et al. 2015). Furthermore, NGC 1856 exhibits a split MS, with
the blue MS hosting about one third of the total number of MS stars
(Milone et al. 2015).

This ﬁnding reveals that young clusters with eMSTO and split
MS may provide strong constraints to discriminate between age and
rotation. Indeed, rotational models predict that the blue MS would
evolve into the faint MSTO, while in the case of an age spread, in a
young cluster we still have a split of the upper MS but the blue MS
would be connected to the bright part of the MSTO. Unfortunately,
the connection between stars along the two MSs and the eMSTO
of NGC 1856 is unclear and the CMD of this cluster has been in-
terpreted in terms of both a diﬀerence in age (Milone et al. 2015;
Correnti et al. 2015) and with two coeval stellar populations with
diﬀerent rotational velocity (D’Antona et al. 2015). Noticeably, a
split MS has been previously observed in the ∼100-Myr old LMC
cluster NGC 1844 (Milone et al. 2013) but in this case there is no
evidence of an eMSTO.

In the present paper we exploit high-precision photometry
from the Hubble Space Telescope of the even younger cluster
NGC 1755 in the LMC. NGC 1755, with an age of ∼80 Myr, is in-
deed a particularly interesting object to investigate the morphology
of the MS and MSTO in very young clusters.

The paper is organised as follows. In Sect. 2 we present the
dataset and the methods used to derive stellar photometry and as-
trometry. The CMD of NGC 1755 is shown in Sect. 3 where we
study and characterize the double MS of this cluster. In Sect. 4 we
compare the observed CMD with theoretical models. A summary
and discussion is provided in Sect. 5.

2 DATA AND DATA ANALYSIS

The main dataset used to investigate the multiple stellar popula-
tions in NGC 1755 consists of images taken with Ultraviolet and
Visual Channel of the Wide Field Camera 3 (UVIS/WFC3) on
board of HST . Speciﬁcally, we have used 2×711s images col-
lected through the F336W band and 90s+678s images collected
through the F814W band of UVIS/WFC3 as part of GO 14204
(PI. A. P. Milone). In addition we have used two archive images
taken with the Wide Field Channel of the Advanced Camera for
Survey (WFC/ACS) of HST (GO 9891, PI. G. Gilmore) through the
F555W (50s) and the F814W ﬁlters (40s).

The left panel of Fig. 1 shows the footprints of the WFC/ACS
(red) and UVIS/WFC3 (cyan) images used in this paper and in-
cludes a ﬁeld of view of 3.2×3.2 arcmin around NGC 1755. The
right panel of Fig. 1 shows a trichromatic stacked image of the
UVIS/WFC3 ﬁeld. The red circle has a radius of 40 arcsec and de-
limits a region mostly populated by cluster members that we will
call the NGC 1755 ﬁeld. The green rectangles mark two regions
where the contamination from NGC 1755 is negligible and have, in
total, the same area as the NGC 1755 ﬁeld. These two regions will
be indicated as reference ﬁeld and will be used in Sect. 3 to statis-
tically estimate the ﬁeld-star contamination in the NGC 1755 ﬁeld.
The stellar cluster NGC 1749, which will be not studied in this pa-
per, is visible in the upper-right corner of the stacked image of the
UVIS/WFC3 ﬁeld.

The ACS/WFC images have been corrected for the poor
charge-transfer eﬃciency (CTE) by using the method and the com-
puter program by Anderson & Bedin (2010). Similarly, the correc-
tion for the poor CTE of UVIS/WFC3 images has been carried out
by using a software written by Jay Anderson which is based on the
recipe by Anderson & Bedin (2010).

We have measured stellar magnitude and positions from the
WFC/ACS images by using the computer program from Anderson
et al. (2008). Speciﬁcally, we have measured bright and faint stars
by using two diﬀerent approaches. Bright stars have been measured
in each image independently, by ﬁtting to the central 5×5 pixel of
each star the appropriate PSF model and the measurements have
been combined later. The PSF model has been taken from the li-
brary PSF by Anderson & King (2006) plus a constant perturbation
that accounts for any focus variation of the spacecraft. The magni-
tude and position of each very faint star has been determined by ﬁt-
ting all the pixels in all the exposures simultaneously, and by using
the same PSF model adopted for bright stars. In order to measure
magnitude and ﬂux from the UVIS/WFC3 data we have adapted
the program kitchensink to these images and detector.

For the bright stars with mF336W < 16.55 or mF814W < 15.50
we had to derive photometry from their saturated images. To do this
we used the method developed by Gilliland (2004), which recov-
ers the electrons that have bled into neighbouring pixels. We refer
to the Sect. 8.1 of Anderson et al. (2008) for details on our appli-
cation of this method. We have corrected the stellar positions for
geometrical distortion by using the solution provided by Bellini,
Anderson, & Bedin (2011) for UVIS/WFC3 and by Anderson &
King (2006) for WFC/ACS. Photometry has been calibrated into
the Vega-mag systems as in Bedin et al. (2005) and by adopting the
zero points provided by the STScI web page for WFC3/UVIS1. We
have used several indexes provided by the software as diagnostics
of the photometric and astrometric quality (Anderson et al. 2008)
and we have selected a sample of relatively isolated stars with small
astrometric and photometric errors, and well ﬁtted by the PSF. We
refer to Sect. 2.1 of Milone et al. (2009) for details.

2.1 Artiﬁcial stars

Artiﬁcial stars (ASs) have been used both to estimate the complete-
ness level of each star and to generate synthetic CMDs to be com-
pared with the observations. The method adopted to perform the
AS-test has been described by Anderson et al. (2008). Brieﬂy, we
have generated a list of 5×105 ASs, including their coordinates and
magnitudes and placed them along the MS of NGC 1755. For each
AS in the list the software developed by Anderson et al. (2008) gen-
erates a star in the images with the appropriate ﬂux and position and
reduces it by using exactly the same procedure and PSF adopted for
real stars. Moreover, the software provides for ASs the same diag-
nostics of the photometric and astrometric quality as for real stars.
Therefore, we have used in our study of NGC 1755 only those ASs
that are relatively isolated, have small astrometric and photometric
errors, and are well ﬁtted by the PSF.

Completeness has been calculated for each observed star ac-
cording to its luminosity and radial distance from the cluster cen-
ter. To do this we have followed the recipe by Milone et al. (2009).
In summary, we have deﬁned a grid of 9 × 6 points in the mag-
nitude versus radius plane and for each point we have determined
the completeness between the number of recovered to added ASs.
The completeness value associated to each star has been linearly
interpolated among these grid points.

derived from saturated images.

3 THE DOUBLE MAIN SEQUENCE OF NGC 1755

The left panel of Fig. 2 shows the mF814W vs. mF336W − mF814W
CMD for all the stars in the UVIS/WFC3 ﬁeld of view that pass
the criteria of selection discussed in Sect. 2. The most-prominent
feature of the CMD are the two MSs of young stars, that are
clearly visible over a range of more than three magnitudes, from
mF814W ∼ 17.75 towards fainter luminosity. Moreover, at colors

redder than mF336W − mF814W ∼ 0.5 the broadened red-giant branch
(RGB), sub-giant branch (SGB), and MS of ﬁeld LMC stars are
also visible.

The right panel of Fig. 2 is a zoom of the left-panel CMD
around the MS, where we have plotted only stars in the NGC 1755
ﬁeld of view (red circle in the right panel of Fig. 1). This ﬁgure
highlights the main components of the multimodal MS. Speciﬁ-

cally, i) a blue and poorly-populated MS, ii) a red MS, containing
the majority of MS stars and, iii) a broadened distribution of stars
on the red side of the red MS. As we will discuss in Sect. 3.4 the
latter is made of binary systems formed by pairs of MS stars. A vi-
sual inspection of the NGC 1755 ﬁeld reveals that the blue MSTO
is located around mF814W ∼ 18.0 while the MSTO of the red MS
is approximately 0.5 mag brighter. The red and the blue MS seem
to merge together below mF814W ∼ 21.00 although we can not ex-
clude that a small color diﬀerence between the two sequeces, not
detectable with the present dataset due to photometric errors, is
present at fainter luminosity.

The photometry of the stars brighter than the dashed line in
both panels of Fig. 2 has been derived from saturated images. The
error bars shown in the right panel are indicative of the 1-σ uncer-
tainty in color and magnitude. For stars with mF814W > 15.50 and
with mF336W > 16.55 the errors in the F814W and in the F336W
magnitude have been derived from ASs. Speciﬁcally, we have di-
vided the CMD into intervals of 0.2 mag, and for each interval we
have calculated the diﬀerence between the magnitude and the color
of the stars in the input list and the recovered magnitudes and col-
ors. The magnitude and color errors have been estimated as the
68.27th percentile of the absolute values of these diﬀerences. The
photometric errors of stars with mF814W < 15.50 or mF336W < 16.55,
whose photometry have been derived from their saturated images,
have been estimated as the r. m. s. of the distinct magnitude mea-
surements.

In the following we will demonstrate that the three MS com-
ponents are intrinsic features of the cluster CMD, that can not be
attributed neither to ﬁeld-star contamination, nor to photometric er-
rors and/or diﬀerential reddening. Moreover we will show that nei-
ther the red, nor the blue MS are sequences made of non-interacting
binary stars.

3.1 Field-stars contamination

F814W,rf )))2 + (mF336W,cf − mi

The CMDs in Fig. 2 include both cluster members and ﬁeld stars.
In order to investigate the CMD of NGC 1755 members we have
statistically subtracted ﬁeld stars from the CMD of stars in the
NGC 1755 ﬁeld. To do this, we have adopted the procedure used in
the previous papers of this series (Milone et al. 2009, 2013, 2015).
Brieﬂy, we have determined for each star (i) in the reference ﬁelds
a distance
di =q(k((mF336W,cf − mF814W,cf ) − (mi
where mF336W,cf and mF814W,cf are the magnitudes of stars in the
NGC 1755 ﬁeld, while the magnitudes of stars in the reference
ﬁelds are indicated as mF336W,rf and mF814W,rf. The constant, k = 3.9
has been derived as described in detail in Sect. 3.1 of Marino et
al. (2014) and accounts for the fact that the color of a star is better
constrained than its magnitude (Gallart et al. 2003). Then, we have
ﬂagged the closest star in the NGC 1755 ﬁeld as a candidate to be
subtracted and associated to that star a random number 0 < ri < 1.
Finally, we have subtracted from the CMD of stars in the NGC 1755
ﬁeld all the candidates with ri < ci
c f are the
values of the completeness of the star (i) in the reference ﬁeld and
the completeness of the closest star in the NGC 1755 ﬁeld, respec-
tively.

The results are illustrated in Fig. 3. Speciﬁcally, panels (a) and
(b) show the CMD of stars in the NGC 1755 ﬁeld and in the refer-
ence ﬁelds, respectively. The decontaminated CMD is plotted in
the panel (c), while the CMD of all the stars that have been statis-
tically subtracted in shown in panel (d). The fact that the blue and

red MS are clearly visible in the decontaminated CMD of panel (c)
demonstrates that both sequences belong to NGC 1755.

3.2 Spatial variations of the photometric zero point

Variations of the photometric zero point along the ﬁeld of view can
either be due to diﬀerential reddening and to small inaccuracies in
the adopted PSF model (Anderson et al. 2008). Their main eﬀect
on the CMD is a broadening of the sequences, and any photometric
study of multiple stellar populations would require an appropriate
quantitative assessment of such zero-point variations.

To do this we have ﬁrst applied to the stars in the NGC 1755
ﬁeld the method by Milone et al. (2012a) for the correction of dif-
ferential reddening. As a ﬁrst step we have determined the absorp-
tion coeﬃcient in the UVIS/WFC3 F336W and F814W bands and
in the WFC/ACS F555W and F814W bands appropriate for the
analysed bright-MS stars of NGC 1755.

We have employed the ATLAS12 (Kurucz 2005; Sbordone et
al. 2007) and SYNTHE codes (Kurucz 2005) to perform the spec-
tral synthesis in the wavelength interval between 2,500 and 10,000
Å of a star with eﬀective temperature, Teﬀ=13,285 K, gravity
logg = 4.29, and metallicity Z=0.006. The resulting spectrum will
be indicated as reference. According to isochrones from the Geneva
database2 (Georgy et al. 2014), the adopted stellar parameters cor-
respond to a MS star of NGC 1755 with mF814W = 19.1 once we as-
sume reddening E(B −V)=0.1 and distance modulus (m−M)0=18.4
(see Sect. 4 for details). Then, we have determined an absorbed
spectrum by convolving the ﬂux of reference spectrum with the ex-
tinction law by Cardelli et al. (1989). In order to do this we have
assumed E(B−V)=0.1 and RV = 3.1.

The two synthetic spectra have been ﬁnally integrated over
the transmission curves of the ﬁlters used in this paper to derive
the corresponding magnitudes. From the comparison of the mag-
nitude of the absorbed and the reference spectrum we ﬁnd the fol-
lowing values for the absorption coeﬃcients: AUVIS/WFC3
= 5.16
F336W
E(B−V), AUVIS/WFC3
= 3.40 E(B−V),
and AWFC/ACS
= 2.04 E(B−V). These coeﬃcients have been used
to derive the direction of the reddening vector that we have indi-
cated as a red arrow in the mF336W vs. mF336W − mF814W CMD of
stars in the NGC 1755 ﬁeld shown in the left panel of Fig. 4.

In order

to determine the diﬀerential

reddening in the
NGC 1755 ﬁeld, we have ﬁrst rotated the CMD in a reference frame
where the abscissa is parallel to the reddening direction. Then we
have determined the ﬁducial line along the red MS and selected a
sample of reference red-MS stars with high-precision photometry
that pass the criteria of selection of Sect. 2. For each star in the
NGC 1755 ﬁeld we have selected a sample of 50 neighbour ref-
erence stars and calculated the residual colors with respect to the
ﬁducial line. The median of these residuals, determined along the
reddening direction, has been assumed as the diﬀerential reddening
corresponding to each star. The corresponding error has been esti-
mated as the r.m.s of the 50 residual colors divided by the square
root of 49. We have carefully excluded any star from the determi-
nation of its own diﬀerential reddening.

The variation of reddening in the NGC 1755 ﬁeld of view is
very small, the 68.27th percentile of the diﬀerential-reddening dis-
tribution is ∆E(B−V)=0.003 mag and is comparable with the corre-
sponding uncertainty of 0.002 mag. The reddening variation never
exceeds ∆E(B−V)=±0.008 mag. Results are illustrated in Fig. 4

ﬁeld after that the stars in the reference ﬁeld have been statistically subtracted (panel c). CMD of the subtracted stars (panel d).

where we compare the original (left panel) and the corrected CMD
(right panel). The two CMDs are very similar and the split MS is
clearly visible in both of them thus demonstrating that it is real.
Since the reddening variation is negligible, for simplicity, in the
following we will use the original photometry.

To further demonstrate that the split MS is not due to diﬀer-
ential reddening, we have deﬁned the reddening-free pseudo color
C =(mF336W − mF555W)−1.316 (mF555W − mF814W) and the reddening-
free pseudo-magnitude M = mF814W + 0.914 mF555W − mF336W. The
fact that the two MSs are clearly visible in the M vs. C pseudo-
CMD plotted in the right-panel CMD further demonstrates that the
MS split is real. Moreover, we note that the blue MS is more broad-
ened in the pseudo color C than the red MS.

3.3 Population ratio

In order to determine the fraction of stars in each MS we have
adopted the method already used in our previous papers and illus-
trated in Fig. 5 for NGC 1755. The aqua crosses and the black cir-
cles in the CMDs of panels (a) and (b) in Fig. 5 represent stars in the
NGC 1755 and in the reference ﬁelds, respectively. Panel b shows a
zoom of the CMD for MS stars with 17.95 < mF814W < 20.75. The
red ﬁducial line superimposed on the red MS has been determined
as follows. We have ﬁrst selected by eye a sample of bona-ﬁde red-
MS stars and calculated their median colors and magnitude in a se-
ries of magnitude intervals determined by using the naive-estimator
method (Silverman 1986). Speciﬁcally, we started to divide the MS
into a series of F814W magnitude bins of width ν = 0.2 mag. The
bins are deﬁned over a grid of N points separated by steps of ﬁxed
magnitude (s = ν/3). The values of the median colors and magni-
tude have been smoothed by using the technique of boxcar averag-
ing, where each point has been replaced by the average of the three
adjacent points.

The verticalized mF814W vs. ∆(mF336W−mF814W) diagram shown
in panel (c) has been obtained by subtracting from the color of each
star, the corresponding color of the ﬁducial at the same F814W
magnitude. We have then divided the analysed interval of magni-
tude into six bins and determined for each bin the completeness-
corrected ∆(mF336W − mF814W) histogram distribution of stars in the
NGC 1755 ﬁeld (gray-dashed histogram in panels d) and for stars

in the reference ﬁelds (aqua-dashed histogram in panels d). Fi-
nally, we have determined the black histograms shown in panel
(d) as the diﬀerence between the gray and the aqua ones and ﬁt-
ted them with a bi-Gaussian function. In order to minimize the
eﬀect of binaries, we have used only the histogram region with
∆(mF336W − mF814W)< 0.1 in the determination of the best-ﬁt func-
tion. The number of blue-MS and red-MS stars has been deter-
mined from the area under the red and the blue Gaussians shown in
panels (d) of Fig. 5 which are the two components of the best-ﬁtting
bi-Gaussian function.

From the average of the results from the six magnitude bins,
we found that 74±3% and 26±3% of stars belong to the red- and
to the blue-MS, respectively. The error has been estimated as the
r. m. s. of the six independent estimates of the population ratio (σ =
6%) divided by the square root of ﬁve.

3.4 Binaries

In order to investigate the population of binary stars in NGC 1755
we have extended to this cluster the method introduced by Milone
et al. (2012b) in their study of NGC 2808. Brieﬂy, we have divided
the CMD of stars in the NGC 1755 ﬁeld into three regions, namely
A, B, and C that we have coloured blue, red, and green, respectively
in Fig. 6a and we have determined the number of stars, corrected
for completeness, in each region (Nobs
A,B,C). Regions A and B include
most of the single stars in the blue and red MS, while region C
is mostly populated by binaries with large mass ratios. We have
used ASs to generate a large number of CMD with diﬀerent val-
ues for the fraction of blue-MS stars, red-MS stars, and binaries
( fbMS, frMS, and fbin) and compared the simulated and the observed
CMDs. We have assumed a ﬂat mass-ratio distribution for binaries
as observed in the Galactic GCs for q > 0.5 (Milone et al. 2012a;
2016), and, in order to account for ﬁeld-star contamination in the
NGC 1755 ﬁeld, the stars in the reference ﬁeld have been added to
each simulated CMD.

We started to investigate the possibility that the split MS is due
to non-interacting binaries, whose two components belong both to
the blue MS. To do this we have simulated a grid of CMDs with
frMS, and fbin ranging from 0.00 to 1.00 in steps of 0.01. The num-
ber of stars in the simulated CMD has been normalised in such a

mF336W. Black dots represent MS stars with 17.95 < mF814W < 20.75 where the split MS is more evident.

Figure 5. This ﬁgure illustrates the procedure to determine the fraction of stars in the blue and the red MS. Panel (a) shows the CMD for both stars in the
NGC 1755 ﬁeld (black circles) and in the reference ﬁelds (aqua crosses). Panel (b) is a zoom of the previous CMD around the region where the double MS is
more clearly visible. The red line is the ﬁducial line of the red MS. The verticalized CMD is plotted in panel (c) for the stars shown in panel (b). Panels (d)
show the histogram distribution of all the panel-c stars in six magnitude bins. Speciﬁcally the grey- and aqua-shaded histograms refer to stars in the NGC 1755
and in the reference ﬁeld, while the black histogram is obtained as the diﬀerence of the grey- and the aqua-shaded histograms. The black curve overimposed
on the black histogram is the best-ﬁtting function made by the sum of the Gaussians, whose components are coloured red and blue, respectively.

way that the region A of the simulated CMD hosts the same num-
ber of stars as the observed ones. We found that the observed and
simulated CMDs have diﬀerent morphologies and that the num-
bers of simulated and observed stars in both the regions B and C
are very diﬀerent regardless the adopted value of fbin. Results are
shown in the panel (b) of Fig. 6 for the case of fbin = 0.95. Simi-
larly, we have investigated the possibility that the split MS is due to
non-interacting red-MS-red-MS binaries. In this case, as shown in
Fig. 6c, the observed and the simulated CMDs have the same num-
ber of stars in the regions B and C for fbin = 0.46. However, in this
scenario only a few stars are expected in the region A of the sim-
ulated CMD. These ﬁndings demonstrate that the double MS can
not be explained by non-interacting binaries only and that a large
fraction of binaries formed by red MS stars are needed to reproduce
the observations.

In order to determine the fraction of binaries in NGC 1755 and
to obtain a new estimate of the fraction of blue-MS and red-MS
stars, we have simulated a grid of CMDs with fbMS > 0, frMS > 0
and fbin ranging from 0.00 to 1.00 in steps of 0.01. For simplicity,
we have assumed that the components of each binary system have
the same probability to belong both to the red and the blue MS.
Moreover, we have imposed that each simulated CMD hosts the
same number of stars in both regions A and B as the observed ones.
We ﬁnd that the number of stars in the regions A, B, and C of sim-
ulated and the observed CMD are the same for fbMS = 0.24 ± 0.03,
frMS = 0.76 ± 0.03, fbin = 0.41 ± 0.03. The derived fraction of blue-
MS and red-MS stars are in agreement with those derived in the
Sect. 3.3. The derived value of fbin demonstrated that NGC 1755
hosts a large fraction of binaries in close analogy with what is
observed in other young and intermediate-age stars MC clusters
(e.g. Milone et al. 2009, 2013, 2015; Geller et al. 2015).

3.5 The CMD from WFC/ACS photometry

To further investigate the double MS of NGC 1755 we compare in
Fig. 7 the CMD obtained from UVIS/WFC3 photometry in F336W
and F814W bands (left panel) and the mF555W vs. mF555W − mF814W
CMD from WFC/ACS data (middle and right panel). We have
used the mF814W vs. ∆(mF336W − mF814W) diagram of Fig. 5c to se-
lect a group of bona-ﬁde red-MS stars with −0.10 6 ∆(mF336W −
mF814W < 0.07) and a group of bona-ﬁne blue-MS stars with
−0.40 6 ∆(mF336W − mF814W)< −0.10. These red- and blue-MS
stars are coloured red and blue, respectively in the left and the right
panel of Fig. 7. We have determined the ﬁducial lines of the two
MSs by using the same method described in the Sect. 3.3 and show
them in the inset of the right-panel of Fig. 7. We ﬁnd that blue-MS
stars have, on average, bluer mF555W − mF814W color than red-MS
stars.

The mF555W vs. mF555W − mF814W CMD and the mF814W
vs. mF336W −mF814W shown in Fig. 7 have been derived from two dis-
tinct datasets collected through diﬀerent ﬁlters and cameras. If the
double MS of NGC 1755, identiﬁed from UVIS/WFC3 photometry,
is an artefact due to photometric errors, we would have the same
probability for red-MS stars of being either bluer or redder than
the blue in the ACS/WFC CMD. The fact that blue-MS and red-
MS stars have diﬀerent colors in both CMD further demonstrates
that the double MS is intrinsic (Anderson et al. 2009). Nevertheless,
the separation between the blue and the red MS is less evident in
mF555W − mF814W than in mF336W − mF814W. This fact suggests that at
a ﬁxed magnitude, blue-MS and red-MS stars have diﬀerent eﬀec-
tive temperature. Indeed for a given temperature diﬀerence, a larger
color baseline like mF336W − mF814W corresponds to a wide color

7

diﬀerence, while a smaller color baseline, like mF555W − mF814W, is
responsible for a smaller color change.

A visual inspection at the mF555W vs. mF555W − mF814W CMD
reveals that, above the MSTO, the MS of NGC 1755 is broadened
with some hints of bimodality. The two MSTO components are sep-
arated by ∼0.05 mag in the F555W-F814W color and the observed
broadening is much larger than that expected from photometric er-
rors only, that for these bright MS stars is smaller than 0.02 mag
in color. Similarly, as discussed in Sect. 3.2, the spatial variations
of reddening across the ﬁeld of view are very small and can not
account for the bifurcated MS of NGC 1755. In the right panel of
Fig. 7 we have used cyan and magenta colors to represent the two
groups of MSTO-A and MSTO-B stars that we have selected by
eye in this CMD. We have used the same color codes to represent
these stars in the left-panel CMD. We ﬁnd that, on average MSTO-
A stars have redder mF336W − mF814W colors than MSTO-B stars and
that both MSTO-A and MSTO-B stars have broadened color distri-
bution in the mF814W vs. mF336W − mF814W CMD.

4 COMPARISON WITH THEORY

In order to understand the physical reasons that are responsible for
the double MS and the eMSTO of NGC 1755 we have compared
the observed CMD with isochrones. We have ﬁrst investigated the
possibility that the observed CMD is consistent with multiple stel-
lar populations with the same metallicity but diﬀerent ages. To
do this, we have used isochrones for non-rotating stars from the
BaSTI database3 (Pietrinferni et al. 2006) which account for the
core-convective overshoot during the central H-burning phase (see
Pietrinferni et al. 2004 for details).

In the scenario where the split MS is due to age variation, the
blue MS would correspond to the second stellar generation, while
ﬁrst-generation stars would belong to the red MS. We started to
determine the best ﬁt between the isochrones and the blue MS.

The left panel of Fig. 8 shows that the BaSTI isochrone with
metallicity Z=0.008, helium abundance Y=0.26, and age of 80 Myr
(blue line) provides a good match with the blue MS when we as-
sume reddening E(B−V)=0.06, distance modulus, (m−M)0=18.42
and adopt the relation between the reddening and the absorption
coeﬃcients that we have derived in Sect. 3.2. We also show in the
right panel of Fig. 8 two isochrones with the same metallicity and
helium abundance but ages of 100 Myr (green line) and 150 Myr
(red line). From a visual comparison between these isochrones and
the observed CMD it is clear that, while age variation alone repro-
duces quite well the eMSTO, it cannot be the responsible for the
split MS of NGC 1755.

As an alternative approach, in the central panel of Fig. 8, we
show that the green and the red isochrones with Z=0.010, Y=0.26,
and age of 80 and 100 Myr, respectively, provide a good match with
the red MS when we assume E(B−V)=0.07 and (m−M)0=18.32.
We ﬁnd that a younger isochrone with age of 40 Myr, provides a
good ﬁt of the blue MS for mF814W . 20.5 but it does not reproduce
neither the MSTO of NGC 1755 nor the fainter part of the blue
MS. We conclude that age variation is not responsible for the CMD
morphology of NGC 1755.

In the right panel of Fig. 8 we have compared the observed
CMD of NGC 1755 with two isochrones with diﬀerent metallicity
and age, with the most metal-rich isochrone being also the youngest

diﬀerent metallicity and age. The values adopted for distance modulus, reddening, age, metallicity, and rotation rate are quoted in each panel.

one. The combination of age and metallicity variations provides a
better match of the split MS, when compared to the case of a age
variation alone shown in the left and middle panel. Nevertheless,
we still get a poor ﬁt of the faint MS with 21.00 . mF814W . 22.25.
In panel (a) of Fig. 9 we investigate the possibility that the
observed CMD of NGC 1755 is consistent with distinct stellar pop-
ulations with the same age but diﬀerent metallicity. In this case, the
blue MS would correspond to the most metal-poor stellar popula-
tion. The blue isochrone superimposed on the panel-(a) CMD has
metallicity, Z=0.0080 and is the same isochrone shown in the left
panel of Fig. 9. The green and the red isochrones have the same age
and helium abundance as the blue one but a metallicity of Z=0.010
and Z=0.015, respectively.

The comparison between the isochrones and the observations
reveals that a metallicity variation of Z ∼ 0.007 is required to re-
produce the large color diﬀerence observed between the red and the
blue MS. However we note that the metal-rich and the metal-poor
isochrones are well separated in the magnitude interval 21.00 .
mF814W . 22.25 in contrast with the observations, where the red
and the blue MS merge together below mF814W ∼ 21.00. Moreover,
the magnitude diﬀerence between the MSTO of the isochrone with
Z=0.151 and with Z=0.008 is about 0.2 mag in the F814W and
is signiﬁcantly smaller than the observed ones. These arguments
prove that the split MS and the eMSTO of NGC 1755 can not be
explained in terms of metallicity variation.

The CMD of NGC 1755 is clearly not consistent with distinct
stellar populations with the same age and metallicity but diﬀer-
ent helium abundance as shown in the panel (b) of Fig. 9 where
we compare the observed CMD with isochrones from the Padova
Database with Y=0.26 (Girardi et al. 2002, red line), Y=0.33 (green
line), and Y=0.40 (blue line). In panel (c) of Fig. 9 we further as-
sume that the helium-rich isochrone (red line) is also more metal
rich and younger than the isochrone with Y=0.26 (blue line). When
this speciﬁc combination of age, metallicity, and helium is adopted,
the MS of the helium-rich isochrone is redder than the MS with
Y=0.26 for mF814W . 21 while the two MSs merge together at
fainter luminosity. However, the color separation between the two
isochrones in the magnitude interval mF814W . 21 is signiﬁcantly
smaller than the corresponding color diﬀerence between the blue
and the red MS. These facts demonstrate that helium variation alone

(Girardi et al. 2002, panels c and d) and the Geneva database (Georgy et
al. 2014, panel d). Speciﬁcally, in panel (a) we use non-rotating isochrones
with the same age but diﬀerent metallicity and in panel (b) we show
isochrones with the same age and metallicity but diﬀerent helium abun-
dance. Panel (d) shows isochrones with diﬀerent metallicity, helium and
age. In panel (d) we plot isochrones with the same age, helium and metal-
licity but diﬀerent rotation rates. The values adopted for distance modulus,

as well as a combination of helium, metallicity, and age variation
are not responsible for the split MS and the eMSTO of NGC 1755.
The isochrones from the Geneva database (Ekstr¨om et
al. 2012; Georgy et al. 2013, 2014) with diﬀerent rotation rates are
superimposed on the observed CMD in panel (d) of Fig. 9. In this
case, the blue isochrone has no rotation, while the green and the red
isochrones have rotation, ω, corresponding to 0.80 and 0.95 times
the break-up value (ωcr). The non-rotating isochrone has been ex-
tended to masses M < 1.6M⊙ by using the models of Mowlavi
et al. (2012). Unfortunately rotating isochrones for stars with M <
1.6M⊙ are not available to us. All the isochrones have the same
metallicity, Z=0.006, and an age of 60 Myr. In order to match the
observed CMD, we have adopted reddening E(B−V)=0.12 and dis-
tance modulus, (m−M)0=18.38. In this scenario the blue MS corre-
sponds to the non-rotating isochrone, while the red MS is consistent
with an isochrone with ω = 0.95 × ωcr.
investigate whether

the split upper MS of
NGC 1755 can be explained with stellar populations having dif-
ferent rotation we adopted the procedure illustrated in Fig. 10. In
close analogy with what has been done by D’Antona et al. (2015)
in their study of NGC 1856, we have retrieved from the Geneva
database the synthetic photometry corresponding to the blue and
red isochrones used in the panel (d) of Fig. 9. They have assumed
a random distribution for the viewing angle, adopted the gravity
darkening model by Espinosa Lara & Rieutord (2011) and included
the limb-darkening eﬀect (Claret 2000). We have used the model at-
mospheres by Castelli & Kurucz (2013) to transform the synthetic
simulations into the observational plane by adopting the trans-
mission curves of the F336W and F814W ﬁlters of UVIS/WFC3.
Moreover, we have added to the simulated photometry the photo-
metric errors determined in Sect. 3 and assumed a fraction of bina-
ries, fbin = 0.41 as derived in Sect. 3.4.

To further

The simulated CMD is superimposed on the observed one in
panel (b) of Fig. 10 while in panel (c) we show the corresponding
verticalized mF814W vs. ∆(mF336W − mF814W) that has been derived
as in Sect. 3.3. In both panels (b) we have used blue and red col-
ors to represent non-rotating, and rotating stars respectively. In the
panels (d) of Fig. 10 we compare the observed ∆(mF336W − mF814W)
distribution (black histograms) with the corresponding distribution
of rotating and non-rotating stars in the simulated CMD (red- and
blue-shaded histograms). As shown in Fig. 10, the simulation based
on Geneva models reproduces very well the split upper MS of
NGC 1755 and supports the possibility that stellar rotation is the
main responsible for the split MS and the eMSTO of NGC 1755.
In this context, the evidence, shown in the right panel of Fig. 4,
that the blue MS is more broadened in the pseudo color C than the
red MS could indicate that blue-MS stars span a range of rotation
rates. As an alternative, the blue MS could host large fraction of
non-interacting binaries with small mass ratio.

In the right panel of Fig. 11 we compare the CMD mF555W
vs. mF555W − mF814W with the same isochrones from Georgy et
al. (2014) used in the panel (d) of Fig. 9. Speciﬁcally, the orange
dashed line is the rotational isochrone with ω = 0.95ωcr and the
cyan dashed line is the non-rotational isochrone. We have assumed
for all the isochrones shown in Fig. 11 the same values of metal-
licity, distance modulus, and reddening that we have previously
determined from the analysis of the mF814W vs. mF336W − mF814W
CMD. The two isochrones represented with dashed lines have also
the same age of 60 Myr as those shown in in the panel (d) of Fig. 9.
In addition we have shown a 100-Myr old non-rotating isochrone
(cyan dotted line).

The comparison between the isochrones and the ﬁducial lines

of the red and the blue MS is illustrated in the mF555W vs. mF555W −
mF814W CMD and in the verticalized mF555W vs. ∆(mF555W − mF814W)
CMD plotted in the upper-right and lower-right panels of Fig. 11,
respectively. The values of ∆(mF555W − mF814W) used in the vertical-
ized diagram have been derived for the ﬁducial lines by subtracting
from the mF555W − mF814W color of each ﬁducial, the color of the
red-MS ﬁducial at the corresponding F555W magnitude. Similarly,
we have determined ∆(mF555W − mF814W) for the isochrones by sub-
tracting from the color of each isochrone the correspond color of
the rotating isochrone.

Our analysis of the mF555W vs. mF555W − mF814W CMD conﬁrms
that the MS split is well reproduced by two stellar populations with
diﬀerent rotation rates. In contrast, isochrones with diﬀerent age
are not able to properly reproduce the observed red and the blue
MS.

Noticeably, both the simulation shown in Fig. 10 and the com-
parison between the CMD and the isochrones plotted in Fig. 11
are not fully satisfactory as the entire eMSTO and the SGB are
poorly reproduced by the models. In priciple, we could improve
the ﬁt between the models and the observed MSTO by assuming
that the non-rotating population is slightly older than the rotating
ones. However, in this case, we would get a poor ﬁt of the split MS
as shown in the right panels of Fig. 11. D’Antona et al. (2015) in
their analysis of the ∼300 Myr old cluster NGC 1856 have noticed
a similar issue and suggested that the poor quality of the ﬁt may
be due to the fact that the end of the core hydrogen burning phase
may be aﬀected by several second-order parameters. These could
include the way in which the inclination angle has been taken into
account for the calculation of the stellar luminosity and eﬀective
temperature.

Moreover, in order to reproduce the split MS, we need that
∼75% of stars are rapid rotators with ω = 0.95 × ωcr, that is very
close to the critical value. As discussed by D’Antona et al. (2015),
the large value of ω could be an artifact related to the speciﬁc treat-
ment of gravity and limb darkening of these models. What is rele-
vant here is that the adopted models from the Geneva group have
allowed, for the ﬁrst time, an appropriate representation of the split
MS and the eMSTO in a young LMC cluster, thus providing strong
indication that rotation is the main responsible for these CMD fea-
tures.

The SGB of intermediate-age GCs has been recently inves-
tigated to discriminate among the diﬀerent scenarios proposed to
interpret the CMD of these objects but results are still controver-
sial. Li et al. (2014) have analyzed the CMD of NGC 1651, whose
eMSTO is consistent with an age spread of 450 Myr and concluded
that its tight SGB excludes such a large age variation. Similar re-
sults have been obtained by Bastian & Niederhofer (2015) from
the analysis of NGC 1806 and NGC 1846. In contrast, Goudfroij
et al. (2015) based on recent stellar models that account for the ef-
fects of convective overshooting, have concluded that the color and
magnitude distribution of SGB stars in NGC 1651, NGC 1806, and
NGC 1846 are consistent with those inferred from eMSTO when
isochrones with diﬀerent ages are adopted. As shown in Fig. 10,
the small number of SGB stars in both the observed and the simu-
lated CMD prevents us from any conclusion based on the SGB in
NGC 1755.

5 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

We have studied the LMC cluster NGC 1755 by means of
high-precision photometry obtained from the UVIS/WFC3 and

Figure 10. mF814W vs. mF336W − mF814W Hess diagram for stars in the NGC 1755 ﬁeld (panel a). Panel (b) compares the observed CMD (black dots) with the
simulated CMD for non-rotating stars (blue symbols) and for rotating stars with ω = 0.95×ωcr (red symbols). The verticalized mF814W vs. ∆(mF336W −mF814W)
CMD around the region where the MS split is most evident is provided in panel (c). Panels (d) compare the distribution of the ∆(mF336W − mF814W) color
in seven magnitude intervals for the observed stars (black histogram) and for the simulated rotating and non-rotating stars (red- and blue-shaded histogram,
respectively).

mF814W ∼ 17.75 towards mF814W ∼ 21.0 where the two MSs seem to
merge together. The mF336W − mF814W color separation is about 0.2
mag at the luminosity of the MSTO of the blue MS and slightly de-
creases towards the lower part of the MS. The TOs of the two MSs
exhibit diﬀerent luminosities with the MSTO of the red MS being
approximatively 0.5 mag brighter than that of the red-MS turn oﬀ
in the F814W band. These ﬁndings make NGC 1755 the youngest
cluster with eMSTO known to date, and, together with NGC 1844
and NGC 1856 (Milone et al. 2013, 2015), one of three Magellanic
Cloud clusters with split MS.

We have demonstrated that the split MS and the eMSTO of
NGC 1755 is real and is not due to ﬁeld-star contamination, pho-
tometric errors, or diﬀerential reddening. Moreover, we have de-
termined the fraction of binary systems and found that NGC 1755
hosts a large fraction of binaries in the analysed ﬁeld of view which
is fbin = 0.41 ± 0.03. Non-interacting binaries are not responsible
for the split MS.

In order to shed light on the physical mechanism responsi-
ble for the split upper MS we have compared the observed CMD
with isochrones with diﬀerent age, metallicity, and rotation rate and
with synthetic CMDs. We have concluded that the double MS and
the eMSTO can not be explained in terms of neither variations in
age nor metallicity variations. On the contrary, we show that the
CMD is consistent with two stellar populations with diﬀerent rota-
tion. These results provide strong constraints on the main scenarios
suggested to interpret the eMSTO phenomenon as we will discuss
in the following subsections.

WFC/ACS data and plotted in the central and right panel of Fig. 7. The
orange and the cyan lines are the same isochrones used in the panel (d) of
Fig. 9 but in the mF555W vs. mF555W − mF814W plane, while the dotted line is

in the upper-right panel compares the isochrones with the ﬁducial line of
the blue and the red MS (blue and red continuous line, respectively). The
corresponding verticalized CMD is plotted in the lower-right panel.

∼80-Myr old cluster is split into a blue and a red component
hosting about the 25% and 75%, respectively, of the total num-
ber of MS stars in the analysed magnitude interval with 17.95 <
mF814W < 20.75. The double MS is visible over a range of more
than three magnitudes in the mF814W vs. mF336W−mF814W CMD, from

5.1 Age diﬀerence

The eMSTOs observed in most intermediate-age Magellanic Cloud
star clusters have been interpreted by several groups as due to
a extended star formation (e.g. Mackey & Broby Nielsen 2007;
Baume et al. 2007; Glatt et al. 2008; Milone et al. 2009; Goud-
frooij et al. 2011). Moreover, Milone et al. (2015) and Correnti et

12

A. P. Milone et al.

al. (2015) have shown that the eMSTO of the ∼300 Myr-old cluster
NGC 1856 is consistent with a prolonged period of star formation
with a duration of about 150 Myr. In contrast, the observed CMD of
NGC 1755 is not consistent with a diﬀerence in age. If we assume,
that the same physical process is responsible for both the eMSTO
and the split MS of NGC 1755, NGC 1856, and for the eMSTO in
the intermediate-age Magellanic Clouds star clusters, our ﬁndings
rule out the possibility that these CMD features are mostly due to
age diﬀerence.

Goudfrooij et al. (2014) have found a correlation between the
MSTO width and the escape velocity of the host cluster and sug-
gested that the eMSTO would occur in clusters with escape veloc-
ities greater than ∼15 km s−1, whose velocity escape are higher
than the velocity of the stellar winds of ﬁrst-generation stars out
of which the second generations form. Moreover Goudfrooij and
collaborators have hypothesised an early-mass threshold of Mcl ∼
104.8M⊙ above which clusters seem to be able to host an eMSTO.
NGC 1755 has a mass of 104.0M⊙ (Popescu et al. 2012) well
below the threshold suggested by Goudfrooij et al. (2014). Thus, if
the same physical process is responsible for the eMSTO of young
and intermediate-age Magellanic Clouds star clusters, the fact that
the MSTO of this low-mass cluster is not consistent with a single
isochrone would represent a challenge for the scenario by Goud-
frooij and collaborators.

5.2 Metallicity variations

Milone et al. (2015) have shown that, among other viable interpre-
tations, the split MS and the eMSTO of NGC 1856 could also be
consistent with multiple stellar population with diﬀerent metallic-
ity. While variations in iron have been observed in several massive
Galactic GCs (see Marino et al. 2015 and references in their Ta-
ble 10), high-precision photometry of intermediate-age star clus-
ters have shown that the RGB are narrow and well deﬁned and are
not consistent with large metallicity variations. Moreover, Muccia-
relli et al. (2014) have inferred the iron abundance of eight stars in
the eMSTO cluster NGC 1806 and have concluded that this cluster
has homogeneous [Fe/H]. The comparison between the observed
CMD of NGC 1755 and isochrones with diﬀerent Z-values and
ages rule out metallicity variation as responsible for the eMSTO
phenomenon.

5.3 Helium variations

The CMD of nearly all the old Galactic GCs is made of two or
more sequences that can be followed along the entire CMD, from
the RGB tip, to the hydrogen-burning limit, and correspond to stel-
lar populations with diﬀerent helium content (Milone et al. 2012c)
and light-element abundance (see Gratton et al. 2012 for a review
on the chemical composition of multiple stellar populations in
GCs). The helium variation ranges from ∆Y∼0.15 as in ω Centauri
and NGC 2808 (e.g. D’Antona et al. 2002, 2005; Bedin et al. 2004;
Norris 2004; Piotto et al. 2007) to ∆Y∼0.01 as in NGC 6397 and
NGC 288 (e.g. Milone et al. 2012c; Piotto et al. 2013; see Table 2
from Milone et al. 2014).

In contrast, isochrones with diﬀerent helium abundance do not
reproduce the observed CMD of NGC 1755. This fact provides a
signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the multiple sequences observed in
the old Galactic GCs and in the young MC clusters.

5.4 Interacting binaries

Merged binary systems and interacting binaries have been sug-
gested as possible responsible for the eMSTO in intermediate-age
clusters (Yang et al. 2011). Appropriate models, which unfortu-
nately are not available to us, are mandatory to establish to what
extend these binary systems are responsible for the eMSTO and the
split MS of NGC 1755.

However, we note that the main challenge for this scenario
is that, while the MSTO of intermediate-age MC clusters is either
broadened or bimodal, their MS is narrow and well deﬁned, thus
suggesting that binaries would aﬀect only a small mass interval
of the CMD. In addition, binary systems and interactive binaries
would produce a spread distribution of the color of stellar sources
in the CMD and are not consistent with the split MS observed in
NGC 1755 and NGC 1856.

5.5 Rotation

Multiple stellar populations with diﬀerent rotation rates can mimic
an age spread in intermediate-age star clusters and can be respon-
sible for their eMSTOs as ﬁrst suggested by Bastian & De Mink
(2009). Indeed the stellar structure is signiﬁcantly aﬀected by stel-
lar rotation and its eﬀective temperature depends on the angle be-
tween the star and the observer.

As discussed by Yang et al. (2013) the parameters adopted in
the description of rotational mixing dramatically aﬀect the rota-
tional models so that the eMSTO of intermediate-age star clus-
ters can be explained or not in terms of rotation depending on
the adopted set of models. As an example the conclusion by Bas-
tian & De Mink (2009) is not supported by the results of Girardi
et al. (2011) who have calculated isochrones for intermediate-age
MC clusters and concluded that the eMSTO can not be repro-
duced by variations in the rotation rate. More recently, Brand &
Huang (2015) and Niederhofer et al. (2015) have shown that rotat-
ing models by Georgy et al. (2014) can account for the eMSTO in
intermediate-age clusters.

Similar conclusion that rotation is respondible for the eMSTO
come from the study by D’Antona et al. (2015) of the ∼300-Myr
old LMC cluster NGC 1856. This cluster exhibits both an eMSTO
and a split MS with the blue MS hosting about one third of the total
number of MS stars. D’Antona and collaborators have shown that
the CMD of NGC 1856 is consistent with two stellar populations.
A group of non-rotating or slow-rotating stars that correspond to
the blue MS and the faint MSTO, plus a population of fast rotating
stars with ω = 0.90 × ωcr that are associated to the red MS and
the bright MSTO. As in the present case, the authors warn that the
choice of ω = 0.90 × ωcr may simply represent a formal solution,
linked to the choices of Georgy et al. (2014) concerning limb and
gravity darkening.

In this paper, we have used models from Georgy et al. (2014)
and ﬁnd that the observed CMD of NGC 1755 is consistent with
two stellar populations with diﬀerent rotation rates. A stellar popu-
lation hosting about one-forth of the total number of stars with no
rotation plus a population of fast rotating stars with ω = 0.95 × ωcr.
While the CMD of NGC 1856 was also consistent with age or
metallicity variations (Milone et al. 2015; Correnti et al. 2015), the
observations of the young NGC 1755 rule out age and metallicity
variations as responsible for the eMSTO and the split MS. Unfortu-
nately, rotating models for stars with M < 1.6M⊙ are not available
to us, and our conclusions are based on the comparison between the
models and the CMD region with mF814W . 21.

Noticeably, the interpretation of the eMSTO phenomenon in
MC clusters is due to stellar populations with diﬀerent rotation is
still controversial. First of all, multiple MSs have been detected
only in three clusters younger than ∼300 Myr, namely NGC 1844,
NGC 1755 and NGC 1856 and the eMSTO has been observed only
in the latter two clusters. Appropriate observations of a large sam-
ple of young clusters are needed to establish to what extent the
multiple MSs and eMSTO are common features of these objects.
Moreover, there are signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the interpretation of
the eMSTO in intermediate-age and young clusters. As an exam-
ple, the conclusion by Niederhofer et al. (2015) that the eMSTO of
intermediate-age clusters can be explained in terms of stellar rota-
tion, are valid as long as the initial rotation distribution covers the
interval from ω ∼ 0.0 and ω ∼ 0.5ωcr. In contrast, the split MS of
NGC 1755 and NGC 1856 are consistent with two distinct popula-
tions with extreme values of ω = 0.0 and ω ∼ 0.9 × ωcr. We also
emphasize that the rotational models adopted in this paper provide
a poor ﬁt of the eMSTO of NGC 1755 although this issue could
by due to second-order parameters that aﬀect the hydrogen burning
phase. As an example, the stellar luminosity and eﬀective temper-
ature are signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the way the in which the incli-
nation angle has been taken into account (see D’Antona et al. 2015
for details).

As previously noticed by D’Antona et al. (2015)

for
NGC 1856, the origin of the non-rotating or slow-rotating stellar
populations is another open issue and a possible solution could
come from studies on B- and A-type stars in the ﬁeld. Since most
of the ﬁeld B- and A-type stars are rapid rotators, the main chal-
lenge would concern the physical process responsible for slowing
down about one forth of stars in NGC 1755. A bimodal velocity
distribution, with a slow-velocity component, has been observed by
Zorec & Royer (2012) among MS ﬁeld stars with 2.40M⊙ < M <
3.85M⊙ and by Dufton et al. (2013) among early B-type stars. This
analysis was mostly appropriate for NGC 1856 stars, with turnoﬀ
masses of ∼ 3M⊙. Here we are dealing also with masses consider-
ably larger, up to 5 M⊙ or more, for which the observational data
are scarce. It is well possible that we are witnessing the same kind
of process.

Zorec & Royer (2012) have suggested that the observed slow-
rotating and non-rotating stars would have lost their angular mo-
mentum during the pre-MS phase due to magnetic breaking. As an
alternative, tidal interaction in binary systems could be responsible
for the slow down of a fraction of stars.

The latter hypothesis is supported by the study of B- and A-
type stars by Abt & Boonyarak (2004). These authors have found
that, due to tidal interaction, the rotational velocities in binaries
with period between 4 and 500 days is signiﬁcantly smaller than
for single stars. D’Antona et al. (2015) have thus suggested that
binary synchronisation could be responsible for the slow-rotating
population of NGC 1856 and we can extend this view to the case of
NGC 1755.

In this context, we note that the fraction of non-rotating stars in
the ∼300 Myr old cluster NGC 1856 is the 33±5% of the total num-
ber of MS stars (Milone et al. 2015) and is slightly higher than that
observed in the younger cluster NGC 1755. These values are simi-
lar to the fraction of stars in the faint MSTO of the intermediate-age
clusters NGC 1806 (26±4%), NGC 1846 (25±3%), and NGC 1751
(31±4%, Milone et al. 2009) and suggest that, whatever the mech-
anism for slowing down rotation, it must be a fast process, so that
there is no correlation between the cluster age and the fraction of
non-rotating stars. Otherwhise, we must assume that a fraction of
∼25-30% of cluster stars are born slowly rotating.
