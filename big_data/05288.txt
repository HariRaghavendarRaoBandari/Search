The origin of Cooper pairing in high-temperature superconductors, such as the copper-oxide and
iron-based system, is still under debate. High transition temperatures together with unconventional
pairing states support the picture of an electronic pairing glue in the cuprates, where superconductivity
is mediated by collective bosonic excitations of the electron ﬂuid. In other materials, most importantly
iron based systems with only hole or only electron pockets, the microscopic origin is hotly debated.
Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has been shown to be a powerful experimental probe to detect
electronic excitations and further allows to deduce some ﬁngerprints of bosonic collective modes.
Here, we demonstrate that the inclusion of inelastic tunnel events is crucial for the interpretation
of tunneling spectra and allows to directly probe bosonic excitations via STM. We develop a model
describing both the elastic tunneling current, which displays the electronic spectral function, and the
inelastic current, that contains the information about the bosonic spectrum, in the superconducting
state. Adopting this extended tunneling formalism we can naturally reproduce the tunneling spectra
of various unconventional superconductors and trace the occurring features back to an opening of a
spin gap in the superconducting state. More generally, our approach is a strong argument in favour
of a collective mode mediating the pairing state in particular in iron-based systems. In particular, we
conclude that the debated pairing mechanism in LiFeSe is also of electronic origin with sign-changing
pairing symmetry.

Electron tunneling spectroscopy has turned out to be
an outstanding tool for the determination of the super-
conducting pairing glue in many materials, especially in
the case of conventional phonon-pairing [1, 2]. Conven-
tional elastic tunneling theory [3, 4] interprets the con-
ductance to be proportional to the electronic density of
states (DOS) for low temperatures. In Bardeen-Cooper-
Schrieﬀer (BCS) theory, the coupling to phonons was
approximated to be energy and momentum independent
in an energy range around the Fermi energy set by the
Debye frequency leading to the well known coherence
peaks outside/at the superconducting gap ∆ (see Fig-
ure 1, black curve). In strong coupling theory [5], both
an energy dependent coupling to phonons and the details
of the phonon DOS enter leading to renormalization of
the electronic DOS above the coherence peaks causing
peak-dip features on top of the BCS DOS, as seen by
elastic tunneling [1]. Besides the possibility of the local
resolution, another major advance in the usage of STM
is quasi-particles interference spectroscopy that exploits
standing waves due to impurity scattering in a correlated
material [6–8].
In general electron-boson coupling can

also lead to the inelastic emission of real bosons in a
scattering event during the tunneling process. Such an
inelastic tunneling event is depicted in Fig. 1: A tip elec-
tron tunnels elastically into an high-energy oﬀ-shell state
far away from the Fermi surface of the superconductor,
from where the electron then is inelastically scattered via
the emission/absorption of a boson to a state near the
Fermi-surface in the superconductor. This process has
been observed for conventional superconductors in the
normal state [9, 10] and has recently been shown to be
of relevance even in the superconducting state for scan-
ning tunneling spectroscopy [11]. Similarly, in the nor-
mal state of the cuprate superconductors it is well estab-
lished that inelastic tunneling channels are present and in
general not negligible [12–18]. They give rise to the fre-
quently observed V-shape of the normal state spectrum
closely tied to an overdamped particle-hole spectrum as
depicted by the blue curve in Figure 1. Such background
conductances are also frequently seen in the iron pnictide
superconductors [19–21].

The same inelastic tunneling processes that are present
in the normal state will also play a role below Tc and

2

FIG. 1: Sketch of elastic and inelastic tunneling and the STM spectra expected for a system with resonance
mode. The inelastic tunneling process involves a intermediate oﬀ-shell state far away from the Fermi surface, which is then
scattered inelastically via the emission/absorption of a boson to a state near the superconducting Fermi surface. The diﬀerential
conductance σ(U ) = dI/dU is calculated from the sum of elastic and inelastic tunneling currents I = I e + I i normalized to the
purely elastic conductance σ0 in the normal state. Shown are in black the elastic spectrum of the simple BCS state, in green
the strong-coupling elastic spectrum for electrons coupled to a spin mode, in blue the total elastic and inelastic spectrum in
the normal state and in red the total spectrum in the superconducting state with superconducting gap ∆ and resonance mode

V-shaped conductance background in the normal state. The temperature has been set to 0.1 ∆ for the superconducting spectra
and 0.5 ∆ for the normal spectra.

must be included in the interpretation of cuprate and
iron-based superconductors, where peak-dip features in
the conductance of tunneling experiments have been in-
tensely investigated and discussed. The most frequent in-
terpretation is based on elastic tunneling theory in terms
of a renormalization of the electronic spectral function
by coupling of electrons to a sharp spin resonance mode
at a frequency ωres at the antiferromagnetic vector of the
material [22–24], a model that is supported also by other
experimental techniques [26–28]. Due to the opening of
the superconducting gap below the transition tempera-
ture Tc, the spin spectrum is gapped by the energy ωres of
the resonance mode. While this resonance mode reveals
essential information on the pairing state, it has been
shown that its contribution to the actual pairing glue
is small [29, 30], i.e. small compared to the overdamped
bosonic modes at higher energies. We here propose to de-
scribe both elastic and inelastic tunneling into unconven-
tional superconductors. This approach reproduces the
resonance mode leading to moderate Eliashberg features
at the superconducting gap ∆ plus the resonance mode
ωres in the elastic channel (green curve in Fig. 1) but
introduces strong inelastic contributions due to coupling
to all bosonic modes (red curve in Fig. 1). The latter
are gapped by ∆ + ωres in the superconducting state. If
compared with the V-shaped normal state background
conductance, the total conductance in the superconduct-
ing state is suppressed for energies above the coherence
peak and below ∆ + ωres in agreement with many experi-
mentally observed tunneling spectra of diverse unconven-
tional superconductors. Thus, the dominance of inelastic

contributions to the tunneling spectra for various uncon-
ventional superconductors pinpoints the relevance of spin
modes in the Cooper pairing.

The distinction between elastic and inelastic tunneling
is ultimately based on the view that the electronic spec-
trum is subdivided into a low-energy renormalized quasi-
particle regime and high-energy oﬀ-shell states. Usu-
ally, many-body interactions are analysed for the renor-
malized quasiparticle excitations, e.g.
in the celebrated
Eliashberg formalism [5]. However, tunneling processes
into oﬀ-shell states far away from the Fermi surface may
subsequently relax into states near the Fermi energy via
the emission of a bosonic excitation. This is a pro-
cess with a large phase space as long as the typical
bosonic momentum is large, examples are zone-boundary
phonons or antiferromagnetic ﬂuctations.

In the following, we develop a theory describing the
tunneling spectra between a superconductor and a nor-
mal metal from a microscopic model including elastic and
inelastic tunneling channels. The corresponding low en-
ergy Hamiltonian is of the following form:

Importantly, the momentum sums for the elec-

such that we can introduce a high-energy cutoﬀ Ec ∼ D

tor (and tip). From this elastic high-energy tunneling

low-energy theory (1) by integrating out the oﬀ-shell elec-
trons with energy ω > EME, where EME is the energy
scale of the Migdal-Eliashberg theory which is typically of
the order of the maximum bosonic energy [31]. Approxi-
mating the dynamic propagator of the oﬀ-shell electrons,

Our formalism can easily be extended to inelastic tunnel-
ing channels involving the multiple emission/absorption
of N bosons, where the matrix element scales with
te(α/D)N , such that in general such contributions will
be suppressed as the band width D is usually the largest
energy scale of the system.

In the following, we investigate how inelastic tunneling
aﬀects the tunneling spectra in unconventional supercon-
ductors. We consider the special case of a spin-fermion
coupling proposed as an eﬀective model for various un-
conventional superconductors [32]. Here, the relevant col-
lective bosonic degrees of freedom can be written in terms

the characteristic energy scale of the boson. The latter
is inversely proportional to the square of the magnetic
correlation length ξ and typically of the order of the su-
perconducting gap ∆ [36–38]. Below Tc one can solve
the Eliashberg equations numerically [39], which we do
for a nodeless pairing state here. As usual, the sign of
the gap changes between states that are connected by
the magnetic wave vector. In the following we have cho-
sen our input parameters ωsf , λ of the theory in such a
way that the observed gap and spin spectrum agrees well
with the experimental observations ωsf (cid:39) ∆ [36–38] and
ωres/2∆ ≈ 0.7 [40]. However, we note that the main con-
clusions of our calculations are not aﬀected by changing
these numbers within reasonable ranges.

In the superconducting state T < Tc a spin gap evolves
as the energy of 2∆ is needed to break up a Cooper pair
and to create a particle-hole excitation. Thus, spin spec-
tral weight is shifted to higher energies by the opening
of the superconducting gap ∆ for the electronic quasi-
particles. This is in contrast to conventional supercon-
ductors, where the phonon modes are only weakly renor-
malized below Tc. Thus, in unconventional superconduc-
tors, it is essential to solve the coupled Eliashberg equa-
tions for the electrons and bosons self-consistently. For
a sign-changing gap symmetry ∆ := ∆k h = −∆k h+Q
(e.g. d-wave or s±-wave depending on the details of
the electronic structure) a sharp resonance peak occurs
near the antiferromagnetic wave vector Q and the energy
ωres < 2∆ [32, 34] (see red curve in Fig. 2b), which leads
to a spin gap of ωres in the integrated spectrum g2χ(ω)
(see red curve in Fig. 2c). For the electronic degrees of
freedom a superconducting gap ∆ appears and due to the
coupling to the spin resonance mode a strong coupling
feature in the electronic DOS ˜νs(ω) evolves at ∆ + ωres
(see red curve of Fig. 2a). Note, however, that there is no
pronounced dip as the spectral weight of the sharp res-
onance mode is small compared to the total integrated
spin spectrum. In case of nodal superconductivity, our
theory is not capable of reproducing the density of states
in the gap region and we concentrate our analysis to fully
gapped systems or features above the quasiparticle peak

where possible nodal excitations are unimportant.

The calculated electronic DOS and integrated spin
spectrum g2χ(ω) shown in Fig. 2 are ﬁnally used to cal-
culate the elastic and inelastic contributions to the con-
ductance via Eqs. (6, 7). We choose T = 0.1∆ for the
superconducting and T = 0.5∆ for the normal state cal-
culations. The elastic conductance reﬂects the DOS of
the superconductor including thermal smearing, which
is constant for the normal state in our model (see blue
curve in Fig. 3a). For T < Tc we see the quasiparti-
cle peak at ω = ∆ as well as the thermally broadened
strong-coupling peak-dip features at ∆ + ωres due to cou-
pling to the resonance mode. In contrast to the elastic
conductance in the normal state, the inelastic conduc-
tance shows a typical V-shape structure similar to the
spectra calculated in Refs. [14, 15] as inelastic processes
open up additional tunneling channels for both positive
and negative bias U (see blue curve in Fig. 3b). Besides
the V-shape, there are no clear features visible for T > Tc
since the overdamped mode only shows little structure in
energy, especially after the integration over the Brillouin
zone. We note that for a ﬁxed tunnel parameter te the
inelastic contribution to the current is temperature de-
pendent. Therefore, the diﬀerential conductance spectra
for the same tunnel parameters for diﬀerent temperatures
do not need to lie on top of each other even for high biases
if inelastic tunneling is present. Note that the inelastic
contributions vanish at zero bias only for T = 0.

In the superconducting state T < Tc the following fea-
tures arise in the tunneling spectrum: The elastic tun-
neling contribution seen in Fig. 3a (red curve) is pro-
portional to the the thermally smeared electronic DOS
with the gap ∆, the coherence peak at ∆ followed by the
usual peak-dip strong-coupling features seen at ∆ + ωres
that quickly approaches the assumed constant DOS of
the normal state for higher biases. In contrast, the in-
elastic tunneling conductance seen in Fig. 3b (red curve)
is gapped by ∆ + ωres as both the electronic DOS and
the bosonic spectrum obtain a gap below Tc. For volt-
ages eU > ∆ + ωres the inelastic diﬀerential conductance
shows a sharp increase but does stay below the normal

state inelastic conductance due to the diﬀerent tempera-
tures as explained above. The shape can be traced back
to the fact that spin spectral weight is shifted from lower
to higher energies, mostly close above the resonance mode
at the frequency ωres.

Naturally, only the sum of the two contributions σ =
σe + σi is observable in experiments posing a normaliza-
tion issue for STM measurements.
In these, the total
conductance is set by the bias voltage and current of the
feedback loop. Here, we here set the tunneling parame-
ters such that the current I at U = 10∆ is the same for
the normal and superconducting state. Fig. 3c depicts
the resulting total conductance including the normaliza-
tion for diﬀerent energy cutoﬀs D. For weak inelastic
contributions (g/D small) mainly the quasiparticle peak
at ∆ is visible on top of a small inelastic increase at high
energies. The Eliashberg-features of the resonance mode
are already obscured by the inelastic contributions (yel-
low curve). If we increase the inelastic tunneling ampli-
tude we see that the conductance in the superconduct-
ing state is lowered in contrast to the normal state at
eU ≈ 2∆ due to the loss of spin spectral weight as was
stated above. Due to the normalization procedure, the
superconducting conductance is slightly larger for a en-
ergies above (cid:38) 3∆. We note, that the obtained spectra
look similar to the measured diﬀerential conductances
in Refs. [16, 17, 19, 41–47], especially the fact that the
superconducting diﬀerential conductance dips below the
normal diﬀerential conductance above the quasiparticle
peak followed by a V-shaped background conductance at
higher energies. For d-wave superconductors it was also

shown that a pronounced peak can occur at ∆ + ωres due
to the coupling to a sharp bosonic mode [25], which will
then even enhance the dip seen in the spectra that show
such a background conductance. Note, that in many
high-temperature superconductors the normal state DOS
is already energy dependent in the energy range of the
superconducting gap. One way to treat this is to include
variations of the DOS in (6,7), which does not alter the
main conclusions, or to normalize the experimental spec-
tra with the normal state DOS.

√

In Fig. 3(d) we plot the normalized conductance
U 2−(∆/e)2), which facilitates a di-
σnorm(U ) = σsc(U )/σnc(
rect comparison with experiments as the eﬀects of the a
non-ﬂat normal state DOS is reduced noticeably. Also
here a signiﬁcant loss of tunneling spectral weight can be
seen in the superconductor for voltages eU < ∆ + ωres,
especially at eU ≈ 2∆, and a following strong increase
of the normalized conductance due to inelastic contri-
butions from the scattering oﬀ the resonance mode. In
the normalized second derivative this gives rise to a peak
at eU ≈ ∆ + ωres. The obtained normalized spectrum
ﬁts well with tunneling data for various iron pnictide su-
perconductors obtained in Refs. [19–21, 48] and cuprate
superconductors [16, 41, 49–51], except for the conduc-
tance in the gap region eU < ∆ due to possible double
gaps or diﬀerent gap symmetries. Note that both the
inelastic contributions and the Eliashberg-features of the
resonance mode create signatures at similar energies, but
the inelastic contributions create a peak in the second
derivative, while the Eliashberg-features create a dip at
∆ + ωres. As for unconventional pairing symmetry, the

interpretation in Refs. [17, 19, 21] are correct regarding
the energy.

In case that already the normal diﬀerential conduc-
tance displays a V-shaped spectrum indicating the sig-
niﬁcance of inelastic contributions, our model suggests
that the features in the superconducting tunneling spec-
tra are dominated by inelastic eﬀects of the gapped spin
spectrum and Eliashberg-features only play a minor role.
The model can be applied to a variety of unconventional
superconductors in order to pinpoint the signiﬁcance of
spin ﬂuctuations for the superconducting pairing. A
prominent example of a hotly debated superconductor
is LiFeAs [19]. The V-shaped normal state spectrum
of this system is evidence for inelastic tunneling events,
while ﬁne structures above the largest gap are fully con-
sistent with the behavior seen in our theory (note that
the peak in the second derivative appears at energies
≈ 2.3∆ consistent with a neutron resonance mode be-
low 2∆). Thus, we conclude that the pairing state of
this system must be sign-changing, corresponding to an
unconventional mechanism for superconductivity. In the
future, this model including inelastic contributions may
allow to invert the problem and to obtain the spectrum
of the pairing glue from experimental tunneling spectra.
The success of the presented analysis further conﬁrms the
view that a distinction of low-energy renormalized quasi-
particles and high-energy oﬀ-shell states is the right one
for system like the cuprate or iron-based superconduc-
tors.
