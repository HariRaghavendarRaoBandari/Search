Search for QCD Instanton-Induced Processes at HERA

in the High-Q2Q2Q2 Domain

H1 Collaboration

Abstract

Signals of QCD instanton-induced processes are searched for in neutral current deep-
inelastic scattering at the electron-proton collider HERA in the kinematic region deﬁned by
the Bjorken-scaling variable x > 10−3, the inelasticity 0.2 < y < 0.7 and the photon vir-
tuality 150 < Q2 < 15000 GeV2. The search is performed using H1 data corresponding to
an integrated luminosity of 351 pb−1. No evidence for the production of QCD instanton-
induced events is observed. Upper limits on the cross section for instanton-induced pro-
cesses between 1.5 pb and 6 pb, at 95% conﬁdence level, are obtained depending on
the kinematic domain in which instantons could be produced. Compared to earlier publica-
tions, the limits are improved by an order of magnitude and for the ﬁrst time are challenging
theory predictions.

1 Introduction

The Standard Model of particle physics contains certain anomalous processes induced by in-
stantons which violate the conservation of baryon and lepton number (B + L) in the case of
electroweak interactions and chirality in the case of strong interactions [1, 2]. In quantum chro-
modynamics (QCD), the theory of strong interactions, instantons are non-perturbative ﬂuctua-
tions of the gluon ﬁeld. They can be interpreted as tunnelling transitions between topologically
different vacua. Deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) offers a unique opportunity [3] to discover a
class of hard processes induced by QCD instantons. The corresponding cross section will be
referred to as the instanton cross section. It is calculable within “instanton-perturbation the-
ory” and is expected to be sizable [4–7]. Moreover, the instanton-induced ﬁnal state exhibits
a characteristic signature [3, 8–11]. Detailed reviews are given elsewhere [12, 13]. The theory
overview given here follows closely the one in the previous H1 publication [14].

An experimental observation of instanton-induced processes would constitute a discovery
of a basic and yet novel non-perturbative QCD effect at high energies. The theory and phe-
nomenology for the production of instanton-induced processes at HERA in neutral current (NC)
electron1-proton collisions has been worked out by Ringwald and Schrempp [3, 5–9]. The size
of the predicted cross section is large enough to make an experimental observation possible. The
expected signal rate is, however, still small compared to that from the standard NC DIS (sDIS)
process. The suppression of the sDIS background is therefore the key issue. QCD instanton-
induced processes can be discriminated from sDIS by their characteristic hadronic ﬁnal state
signature, consisting of a large number of hadrons at high transverse energy emerging from
a “ﬁre-ball”-like topology in the instanton rest system [3, 8, 9]. Discriminating observables,
derived from simulation studies, are exploited to identify a phase space region where a differ-
ence between data and sDIS expectations would indicate a contribution from instanton-induced
processes.

Upper cross section limits on instanton-induced processes have been reported by the H1 [14]
and ZEUS [15] collaborations. This analysis is a continuation of the previous H1 search for
QCD instanton-induced events using a seventeen times larger data sample. The search is carried
out at signiﬁcantly higher virtualities of the exchanged photons as suggested by theoretical
considerations [10].

2 Phenomenology of QCD Instanton-Induced Processes in

NC DIS

Instanton processes predominantly occur in photon gluon (γg) fusion processes as sketched in
ﬁgure 1. The characteristic instanton event signatures result from the following basic chirality
violating reaction:

γ∗ + g

(qR + ¯qR) + ng g,

(I)

→ X

q=d,u,s,...

(I → ¯I, R → L),

(1)

1The term “electron” is used in the following to refer to both electron and positron.

4

where g, qR (¯qR) denotes gluons, right-handed quarks (anti-quarks), and ng is the number of
gluons produced. The chirality violation2 is induced for each ﬂavour, in accord with the corre-
sponding axial anomaly [2]. In consequence, in every instanton event, quark anti-quark pairs of
each of the nf ﬂavours occur precisely once. Right-handed quarks are produced in instanton-
induced processes (I), left-handed quarks are produced in anti-instanton ( ¯I) processes. The
ﬁnal state induced by instantons or anti-instantons can be distinguished only by the chirality of
the quarks. Experimental signatures sensitive to instanton-induced chirality violation are, how-
ever, not exploited in this analysis. Both instanton and anti-instanton processes enter likewise
in the calculation of the total cross section.

Figure 1: Kinematic variables of the dominant instanton-induced process in DIS. The virtual
photon ( γ = e − e′, virtuality Q2), emitted by the incoming electron e, fuses with a gluon (g)
radiated from the proton (P ). The gluon carries a fraction ξ of the longitudinal proton momen-
tum. The virtual quark (q′) is viewed as entering the instanton subprocess and the outgoing
quark q′′ from the photon splitting process is viewed as the current quark. The invariant mass of
the quark gluon (q′g) system is WI, W denotes the invariant mass of the total hadronic system
(the γP system) and ˆs refers to the invariant mass squared of the γg system.

In photon-gluon fusion processes, a photon splits into a quark anti-quark pair in the back-
ground of an instanton or an anti-instanton ﬁeld, as shown in ﬁgure 1 . The so-called instan-
ton subprocess q′ + g
→ X is induced by the quark or the anti-quark fusing with a gluon
g from the proton. The partonic system X contains 2 nf quarks and anti-quarks, where one
of the quarks (anti-quarks) acts as the current quark (q′′). In addition, an average number of
hngi ∼ O(1/αs) ∼ 3 gluons is emitted in the instanton subprocess.

(I, ¯I)

The quarks and gluons emerging from the instanton subprocess are distributed isotropically
in the instanton rest system deﬁned by ~q′ + ~g = 0. Therefore one expects to ﬁnd a pseudo-
rapidity3 (η) region with a width of typically 2 units in η, densely populated with particles of
relatively high transverse momentum and isotropically distributed in azimuth, measured in the
2∆chirality = 2 nf, where ∆chirality = # (qR + ¯qR)− # (qL + ¯qL), and nf is the number of quark ﬂavours.

instanton rest frame. The large number of partons emitted in the instanton process leads to
a high multiplicity of charged and neutral particles. Besides this band in pseudo-rapidity, the
hadronic ﬁnal state also contains a current jet emerging from the outgoing current quark q′′.

(I, ¯I)

The instanton production cross section at HERA, σ(I)

HERA, is determined by the cross section
of the instanton subprocess q′ +g
→ X. The subprocess cross section is calculable in instanton
perturbation theory. It involves the distributions of the size ρ of instantons and of the distance
R between them. By confronting instanton perturbation theory with non-perturbative lattice
simulations of the QCD vacuum, limits on the validity of instanton perturbation theory have
been derived [6, 7, 10]. The perturbative and lattice calculations agree for ρ . 0.35 fm and
R/ρ & 1.05. At larger ρ or smaller R/ρ, the instanton perturbative cross section grows, whereas
the lattice calculations suggest that the cross section is limited. There is a relation between
the variables Q′ and x′
in momentum space and the spatial variables ρ and R/ρ. Large Q′
and x′ values correspond to small ρ and large R/ρ, respectively. The aforementioned limits
can be translated into regions of the kinematical variables x′ and Q′2, in which the perturbative
calculations are expected to be valid, Q′2 ≥ Q′2
min ≃ 0.35 [11].
Here Λnf
is the QCD scale in the MS scheme for nf ﬂavours. In order to assure the dominance
of planar diagrams the additional restriction Q2 ≥ Q′2
min is recommended [5, 10, 11]. The cross
section depends signiﬁcantly on the strong coupling4 αs, or more precisely on Λnf
, but depends
only weakly on the choice of the renormalisation scale.

The calculation of the instanton production cross section in instanton perturbation theory
[5-7] is valid in the dilute instanton-gas approximation for approximately massless ﬂavours, i.e.
nf = 3, in the HERA kinematic domain. The contribution of heavy ﬂavours is expected to be
(exponentially) suppressed [16,17]. Thus calculations of the instanton production cross section
using the QCDINS Monte Carlo generator [11] are performed for nf = 3 massless ﬂavours. It
was checked that the predicted ﬁnal state signature does not change signiﬁcantly when heavy
ﬂavours are included in the simulation.

The analysis is performed in the kinematic region deﬁned by 0.2 < y < 0.7 and 150 <
Q2 < 15000 GeV2. In this kinematic region, and additionally requiring Q′2 > 113 GeV2 and
x′ > 0.35, the cross section predicted by QCDINS is σ(I)

The ﬁducial region in Q′2 and x′ of the validity of instanton perturbation theory was de-
rived from nf = 0 lattice simulations, since nf = 3 was not available for this purpose. The
perturbative instanton calculation is made in the “dilute instanton gas” approximation, where
the average distance between instantons should be large compared to the instanton size. This
approximation is valid for x′ → 1, whereas the boundary x′ = 0.35 corresponds to a conﬁgura-
tion where the distance R is similar to the instanton size ρ. A further simplifying assumption is
made by choosing a simple form of the ﬁducial region with ﬁxed Q′2
min, whereas Q′2

could be varied as a function of x′
instanton perturbation theory is reliable, is, for the reasons given above, not very well deﬁned.

Thus, the theoretical uncertainty of the instanton cross section is difﬁcult to deﬁne and could
be larger than the already signiﬁcant uncertainty due to the uncertainty of the QCD scale Λ(3)

alone. On the other hand, given that the predicted cross section is large, dedicated searches for
instanton-induced processes at HERA are well motivated.

3 Experimental Method

3.1 The H1 Detector

A detailed description of the H1 detector can be found elsewhere [19–22]. The origin of the
H1 coordinate system is given by the nominal ep interaction point at z = 0. The direction
of the proton beam deﬁnes the positive z–axis (forward direction) and the polar angle θ and
transverse momentum PT of every particle is deﬁned with respect to this axis. The azimuthal
angle φ deﬁnes the particle direction in the transverse plane. The detector components most
relevant to this analysis are the Liquid Argon (LAr) calorimeter, which measures the positions
and energies of particles over the range 4◦ < θ < 154◦ with full azimuthal coverage, the inner
tracking detectors, which measure the angles and momenta of charged particles over the range
7◦ < θ < 165◦, and a lead-ﬁbre calorimeter (SpaCal) covering the range 153◦ < θ < 174◦.

The LAr calorimeter consists of an electromagnetic section with lead absorbers and a had-
ronic section with steel absorbers. The electromagnetic and the hadronic sections are highly
segmented in the transverse and the longitudinal directions. Electromagnetic shower energies
are measured with a resolution of δE/E ≃ 0.11/pE/GeV ⊕ 0.01 and hadronic energies with
δE/E ≃ 0.50/pE/GeV ⊕ 0.03 as determined using electron and pion test beam measure-
ments [23, 24].

In the central region, 15◦ < θ < 165◦, the central tracking detector (CTD) measures the
trajectories of charged particles in two cylindrical drift chambers immersed in a uniform 1.16 T
solenoidal magnetic ﬁeld. In addition, the CTD contains a drift chamber (COZ) to improve the
z-coordinate reconstruction and a multi-wire proportional chamber at inner radii (CIP) mainly
used for triggering [25]. The CTD measures charged particles with a transverse momentum
resolution of δ(pT )/pT ≃ 0.002 pT /GeV ⊕ 0.015. The forward tracking detector (FTD) is
used to supplement track reconstruction in the region 7◦ < θ < 30◦ [26].
It improves the
hadronic ﬁnal state reconstruction of forward going low transverse momentum particles. The
CTD tracks are linked to hits in the vertex detector, the central silicon tracker (CST) [27,28], to
provide precise spatial track reconstruction.

In the backward region the SpaCal provides an energy measurement for hadronic particles,
and has a hadronic energy resolution of δE/E ≃ 0.70/pE/GeV ⊕ 0.01 and a resolution for
electromagnetic energy depositions of δE/E ≃ 0.07/pE/GeV ⊕ 0.01 measured using test
beam data [29].

The ep luminosity is determined by measuring the event rate for the Bethe-Heitler process
ep → epγ, where the photon is detected in the photon tagger located at z = −103 m. The
overall normalisation is determined using a precision measurement of the QED Compton pro-
cess [30] with the electron and the photon detected in the SpaCal.

3.2 Data Samples

High Q2 neutral current DIS events are triggered mainly using information from the LAr
calorimeter. The calorimeter has a ﬁnely segmented pointing geometry allowing the trigger
to select localised energy deposits in the electromagnetic section of the calorimeter pointing to
the nominal interaction vertex. For electrons with energies above 11 GeV the trigger efﬁciency
is determined to be close to 100% [31].

This analysis is performed using the full e±p collision data set taken in the years 2003-2007
by the H1 experiment. The data were recorded with a lepton beam of energy 27.6 GeV and a
proton beam of energy 920 GeV, corresponding to a centre-of-mass energy √s = 319 GeV. The
total integrated luminosity of the analysed data is 351 pb−1.

3.3 Simulation of Standard and Instanton Processes

Detailed simulations of the H1 detector response to hadronic ﬁnal states have been performed
for two QCD models of the sDIS (background) and for QCD instanton-induced scattering pro-
cesses (signal).

The background is modelled using the RAPGAP and DJANGOH Monte Carlo programs.
The RAPGAP Monte Carlo program [32] incorporates the O(αs) QCD matrix elements and
models higher order parton emissions to all orders in αs using the concept of parton show-
ers [33] based on the leading-logarithm DGLAP equations [34], where QCD radiation can oc-
cur before and after the hard subprocess. An alternative treatment of the perturbative phase is
implemented in DJANGOH [35] which uses the Colour Dipole Model [36] with QCD matrix
element corrections as implemented in ARIADNE [37]. In both MC generators hadronisation
is modelled with the LUND string fragmentation [38, 39] using the ALEPH tune [40]. QED
radiation and electroweak effects are simulated using the HERACLES [41] program, which is
interfaced to the RAPGAP and DJANGOH event generators. The parton density functions of
the proton are taken from the CTEQ6L set [42].

QCDINS [11, 43] is a Monte Carlo package to simulate QCD instanton-induced scatter-
ing processes in DIS. The hard process generator is embedded in the HERWIG [44] program
and is implemented as explained in section 2. The number of ﬂavours is set to nf = 3. Out-
side the allowed region deﬁned by Q′2
min the instanton cross section is set to zero.
The CTEQ5L [45] parton density functions are employed5. Besides the hard instanton subpro-
cess, subleading QCD emissions are simulated in the leading-logarithm approximation, using
the coherent branching algorithm implemented in HERWIG. The hadronisation is performed
according to the Lund string fragmentation.

min and x′

The generated events are passed through a detailed GEANT3 [46] based simulation of the
H1 detector and subjected to the same reconstruction and analysis chains as are used for the
data.

5In the phase space of this analysis the CTEQ5L and CTEQ6L gluon density distributions are almost identical.

3.4 Inclusive DIS Event Selection

Neutral current DIS events are triggered and selected by requiring a cluster in the electromag-
netic part of the LAr calorimeter. The scattered electron is identiﬁed as the isolated cluster
of highest transverse momentum. A minimal electron energy of 11 GeV is required. The re-
maining clusters in the calorimeters and the charged tracks are attributed to the hadronic ﬁnal
state (HFS), which is reconstructed using an energy ﬂow algorithm without double counting
of energy [47–49]. The default electromagnetic energy calibration and alignment of the H1
detector [50] as well as the HFS calibration [31, 51] are applied. The longitudinal momentum
balance is required to be within 45 GeV < P(E − pz) < 65 GeV, where the sum runs over
the scattered electron and all HFS objects. Furthermore the position of the z-coordinate of the
reconstructed event vertex must be within ±35 cm of the nominal interaction point.

The photon virtuality Q2, the Bjorken scaling variable x and the inelasticity of the interac-
tion y are reconstructed from the scattered electron and the hadronic ﬁnal state particles using
the electron-sigma method [52]. This method is the most precise one in the kinematic range of
this analysis. The events are selected to cover the phase space region deﬁned by 0.2 < y < 0.7,
x > 10−3 and 150 < Q2 < 15000 GeV2.

The events passing the above cuts yield the NC DIS sample which forms the basis of the
subsequent analysis. It consists of about 350000 events. The simulated events are subjected to
the same reconstruction and analysis chains as the real data. They reproduce well the shape and
the absolute normalisation of the distributions of the energy and angle of the scattered electron
as well as the kinematic variables x, Q2 and y.

3.5 Deﬁnition of the Observables and the Search Strategy

The observables used to discriminate the instanton-induced contribution from that of sDIS pro-
cesses are based on the hadronic ﬁnal state objects and on a selection of charged particles. Only
HFS objects with ηLab < 3.2 are considered. Charged particles are required to have transverse
momenta with P Lab
T > 0.12 GeV and polar angles with 20o < θ < 160o. Here ηLab and P Lab
are measured in the laboratory frame.

T

In the following, all HFS objects are boosted to the hadronic centre-of-mass frame (HCM)6.
Jets are deﬁned by the inclusive kT algorithm [53] as implemented in FastJet [54], with the
massless PT recombination scheme and with the distance parameter R0 = 1.35 × Rcone. A
cone radius Rcone = 0.5 is used. Jets are required to have transverse energy in the HCM frame
ET,jet> 3 GeV. Additional requirements on the transverse energy and pseudorapidity of the jets
T,Jet > 2.5 GeV, in order to
in the laboratory frame are imposed, −1.0 < ηLab
ensure that jets are contained within the acceptance of the LAr calorimeter and are well cali-
brated. The events are selected by requiring at least one jet with ET,jet> 4 GeV. The jet with the
highest transverse energy is used to estimate the 4-momentum q′′ of the current quark (see ﬁg-
ure 1). Q′2 can be reconstructed from the particles associated with the current jet and the photon
4-momentum, which is obtained using the measured momentum of the scattered electron. The

Q′2 resolution is about 40%. However, the distribution of the true over the reconstructed value
exhibits large tails, since in about 35% of the cases the wrong jet is identiﬁed as the current jet.
Due to the limited accuracy of the Q′2 reconstruction, the reconstructed Q′2, labelled Q′2
rec, can-
not be used to experimentally limit the analysis to the kinematically allowed region Q′2

Details of the Q′2 reconstruction are described in [9, 55, 56].

The hadronic ﬁnal state objects belonging to the current jet are not used in the deﬁnition
of the following observables. A band in pseudo-rapidity with a width of ±1.1 units in η is
deﬁned around the mean ¯η = P ET η/(P ET ), where the sum includes hadronic ﬁnal state
objects [57]. This pseudo-rapidity band is referred to as the “instanton band”. The number of
charged particles in the instanton band nB and the total scalar transverse energy of all hadronic
ﬁnal state objects in the instanton band ET,B are measured.

An approximate instanton rest frame, where all hadronic ﬁnal state objects in the instanton
band are distributed isotropically, is deﬁned by ~q′ + ξ ~P = 0. The deﬁnition of ξ is given in
ﬁgure 1. A numerical value of ξ = 0.076 is used throughout this analysis [14]. In the in-
stanton rest frame the sphericity SphB and the ﬁrst three normalised Fox-Wolfram moments
are calculated [39, 58]. For spherical events SphB is close to unity, while for pencil-like events
SphB tends to zero. Furthermore, the axes~imin and~imax are found for which in the instanton rest
system the summed projections of the 3-momenta of all hadronic ﬁnal state objects in the in-
stanton band are minimal or maximal [8]. The relative difference between Ein = Ph |~ph ·~imax|
and Eout = Ph |~ph ·~imin| is called ∆B = (Ein − Eout)/Ein. This quantity is a measure of the
transverse energy weighted azimuthal isotropy of an event. For isotropic events ∆B is small
while for pencil-like events ∆B is close to unity.

3.6 Comparison of Data to Standard QCD Predictions

Both the RAPGAP and DJANGOH simulations provide a reasonable overall description of
the experimental data in the inclusive DIS and jet sample. To further improve the agreement
between Monte Carlo events and data, event weights are applied to match the jet multiplicities as
a function of Q2. The MC events are also weighted as a function of PT and η of the most forward
jet in the Breit frame [31, 51]. Furthermore, the track multiplicity distribution is weighted. The
weights are obtained from the ratio of data to the reconstructed MC distributions and are applied
to the events on the generator level. After these weights are applied, the simulations provide a

10

good description of the shapes and normalisation of the data distributions. Examples of these
control distributions are shown in ﬁgure 2: distributions of the kinematic variables x and Q2, the
transverse energy of the jets ET,jets, the pseudorapidity of the jets ηjets in the hadronic centre-
of-mass frame and the charged particle multiplicity nch.

The measured distributions of the ﬁve observables ET,jet, nB, x′

rec, ∆B and Ein are compared
in ﬁgure 3 to the expectations from the standard DIS QCD models (RAPGAP, DJANGOH) and
from the instanton model (QCDINS). The data are reasonably well described by the reweighted
sDIS Monte Carlo simulations. The models are able to describe the data within 5− 10% except
at very low and/or very large values of the given observable, where differences up to 20%
are observed. The expected instanton distributions differ in shape from the sDIS background.
However, the magnitude of the expected signal is small and advanced discrimination methods
are required to enhance the signal to background ratio.

4 Search for Instanton-Induced Events

A multivariate discrimination technique is employed to increase the sensitivity to instanton pro-
cesses. The PDERS (Probability Density Estimator with Range Search) method as implemented
in the TMVA ROOT package [60] is used7.

The strategy to reduce the sDIS background is based on the observables ET,jet, nB, x′,
∆B and Ein. This set of observables has been chosen since it provides the best signal to back-
ground separation [59]. Moreover, the distributions of these variables are overall well described
by both Monte Carlo simulations. The distribution of the discriminator D is shown in ﬁgure 4.
Taking into account the systematic uncertainties, the discriminator distribution is described by
the sDIS Monte Carlo simulations in the background dominated region. For D < 0.2 pre-
dictions and data agree within systematic uncertainties. The background events are mainly
concentrated at low discriminator values, while the instanton signal peaks at large values of the
discriminator. At large D both data and predicted background fall off steeply.

A signal region is deﬁned for D > Dcut = 0.86, optimised for a determination of the
instanton signal from event counting. The distributions of the expected instanton signal and of
the background are shown in ﬁgure 5. No excess of events is observed and the DJANGOH MC
describes the data well, while the prediction of RAPGAP is systematically above the data.

The expected and observed number of events are summarised in table 1. In the signal region,
a total of 2430 events are observed in data, while DJANGOH predicts 2483+77
−90 and RAPGAP
2966+ 90
−103. The uncertainties on the expected number of events include experimental systematic
uncertainties and small contributions from the ﬁnite sample sizes. For the expected number of
instanton-induced events the dominating uncertainty is due to Λ(3)

.

• The energy scale of the HFS is known to a precision of 1% [31, 51].
• Depending on the electron polar angle the energy of the scattered electron is measured

with a precision of 0.5 − 1% [61].

• The precision of the electron polar angle measurement is 1 mrad [61].
• Depending on the electron polar angle, the uncertainty on the electron identiﬁcation efﬁ-

ciency ranges from 0.5 to 2% [51].

• The uncertainty associated with the track reconstruction efﬁciency and the effect of the
nuclear interactions in the detector material on the efﬁciency of track reconstruction are
estimated to be 0.5% each [62].

The effect of these uncertainties on the expected signal and background distributions is de-
termined by varying the corresponding quantities by ±1 standard deviation in the MC samples
and propagating these variations through the whole analysis. The above systematic and statis-
tical uncertainties added in quadrature are shown in the ﬁgures and in table 1. The included
statistical uncertainties due to the limited Monte Carlo statistics are approximately an order of
magnitude smaller than the experimental systematic uncertainties.

The main contributions to the experimental systematic uncertainties arise from the energy
scale calibration of the scattered electron ranging from ∼ 4% in the background dominated
region to ∼ 1% in the signal region and from the energy scale of the HFS ranging from ∼ 1%
in the background region to ∼ 2.5% in the signal region. Uncertainties connected with the track
reconstruction and secondary interactions of the produced hadrons in the material surrounding
the interaction region contribute to the systematic error in the signal region at a level of ∼ 2%

discriminator, the uncertainties on the electron identiﬁcation and on the precision of the electron
polar angle are smaller than 0.5% each.

Given the observed and expected numbers of events, no evidence for QCD instanton-induced

processes is observed. In the following, the data are used to set exclusion limits.

5 Exclusion Limits for Instanton-Induced Processes

The upper limit is determined from a CLs statistical analysis [63, 64] using the method of frac-
tional event counting [65]. A test statistic X is constructed as a fractional event count of all

12

events using the discriminator distribution:

X =

Nbin

X

i=1

wini ,

(2)

where the sum runs over all bins, and ni is the number of events observed in bin i. The weights
wi are calculated from the predicted signal and background contributions and their uncertainties,
using an appropriate set of linear equations [65]. They are deﬁned in such a way as to ensure
that only bins with both a large signal-to-background ratio and small systematic uncertainties
enter with sizable weights into the test statistic X. In case of negligible systematic uncertainties,
the weights behave as wi = si/(si + 2bi) where si and bi are the predicted number of signal
and background events in a given bin i, respectively. A large number of MC experiments are
generated by varying the expected number of events in absence or presence of the signal within
the statistical and systematic uncertainties. Systematic uncertainties are treated as Gaussian
distributions and statistical ﬂuctuations are simulated using Poisson statistics. If 1 − CLs >
0.95, the signal hypothesis is excluded at 95% conﬁdence level.

Limits are calculated using the full range of the discriminator distribution as shown in ﬁg-
ure 4. The following additional systematic uncertainties are included in the exclusion limit
calculation:

• The normalisation uncertainty due to the precision of the integrated luminosity measure-

ment is 2.3% [30].

• The difference between the prediction from DJANGOH and RAPGAP is assigned as
model uncertainty of the background estimation, i.e. the difference between two back-
ground histograms in ﬁgure 4. This model uncertainty is large, 8 − 20% and 13 − 46%,
for small D < 0.2 and large D > 0.85 values of the discriminator, respectively. For
intermediate values of D it amounts to 0.3 − 8%.

• The uncertainty of the background normalisation is 1.1%. This uncertainty is estimated
as ǫ = (NDj − NRap)/NDj, where NDj and NRap are the total number of predicted events
in the full discriminator range for the DJANGOH and RAPGAP MC simulations, respec-
tively.
• The uncertainty of the predicted signal cross section due to the uncertainty of Λ(3)

Figure 6 shows the behaviour of the observed CLs as a function of the instanton signal cross
section. In this study the total instanton cross section is taken as a free parameter, whereas the
signal shape is taken from the QCDINS simulation. At 95% CL, the observed limit is 2 pb,
as compared to a median expected cross section limit of 3.7+1.6
−1.7(95%) pb. The ﬁrst
(second) set of uncertainties indicates the corresponding ±1σ (±2σ) deviations of the median
expected cross section limit. The observed −2σ deviation between the expected and observed
limit is caused by a downward ﬂuctuation of the observed data test statistics X. This downward
ﬂuctuation receives contributions both from regions where the weights wi are positive and the

data are somewhat larger than expected.

The QCD instanton model implemented in QCDINS, restricted to the kinematic region de-

ﬁned by x′

6 Conclusions

A search for QCD instanton-induced processes is presented in neutral current deep-inelastic
scattering at the electron-proton collider HERA. The kinematic region is deﬁned by the Bjorken-
scaling variable x > 10−3, the inelasticity 0.2 < y < 0.7 and the photon virtuality 150 < Q2 <
15000 GeV2. The search is performed using H1 data corresponding to an integrated luminosity
of 351 pb−1.

Several observables of the hadronic ﬁnal state of the selected events are exploited to identify
a potentially instanton-enriched sample. Two Monte Carlo models, RAPGAP and DJANGOH,
are used to estimate the background from the standard NC DIS processes. The instanton-
induced processes are modelled by the program QCDINS. In order to extract the expected
instanton signal a multivariate data analysis technique is used. No evidence for QCD instanton-
induced processes is observed. In the kinematic region deﬁned by the theory cut-off parameters
min = 0.35 and Q′2
min = 113 GeV2 an upper limit of 2 pb on the instanton cross section at
x′

14

95% CL is determined, as compared to a median expected limit of 3.7+1.6
−1.7(95%) pb.
Thus, the corresponding predicted instanton cross section of 10 ± 3 pb is excluded by the H1
min. These limits may be
data. Limits are also set in the kinematic plane deﬁned by x′
used to assess the compatibility of theoretical assumptions such as the dilute gas approximation
with H1 data, or to test theoretical predictions of instanton properties such as their size and
distance distributions.

minand Q′2

Upper cross section limits on instanton-induced processes reported previously by the H1
[14] and ZEUS [15] collaborations are above the theoretical predicted cross sections.
In a
domain of phase space with a lower Q2 range (10 . Q2 < 100 GeV2), H1 reported an upper
limit of 221 pb at 95% CL, about a factor ﬁve above the corresponding theoretical prediction.
At high Q2 (Q2 > 120 GeV2), the ZEUS Collaboration obtained an upper limit of 26 pb at
95% CL in comparison to a predicted cross section of 8.9 pb. In summary, compared to earlier
publications, QCD instanton exclusion limits are improved by an order of magnitude and are
challenging theory predictions for the ﬁrst time.
