We analyze vector localized solutions of two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with
variable nonlinearity parameter and external trap potential through similarity transformation tech-
nique which transforms the two coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations into a pair of coupled nonlinear
Schr¨odinger equations with constant coeﬃcients under a speciﬁc integrability condition.
In this
analysis we consider three diﬀerent types of external trap potentials: a time-independent trap, a
time-dependent monotonic trap, and a time-dependent periodic trap. We point out the existence of
diﬀerent interesting localized structures, namely rogue waves, dark-and bright soliton-rogue wave,
and rogue wave-breather-like wave for the above three cases of trap potentials. We show how the
vector localized density proﬁles in a constant background get deformed when we tune the strength
of the trap parameter. Further we investigate the nature of the trajectories of the nonautonomous
rogue waves. We also construct the dark-dark rogue wave solution for repulsive-repulsive interaction
of two-component BECs and analyze the associated characteristics for the three diﬀerent kinds of
traps. We then deduce single, two and three composite rogue waves for three component BECs and
discuss the correlated characteristics when we tune the strength of the trap parameter for diﬀerent
trap potentials.

INTRODUCTION

The study of multi-component nonlinear waves is one
of the fascinating topics which has potential applications
in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in atomic physics
[1] and optial ﬁbers in nonlinear optics [2]. The real-
ization of BECs in weakly interacting atomic gases has
strongly stimulated a large number of studies on explor-
ing nonlinear properties of matter waves such as en-
velope solitons, gap solitons, soliton chains and so on
[3, 4]. The development in trapping techniques for BECs
has allowed experimentalists to simulataneously conﬁne
atomic clouds in diﬀerent hyperﬁne spin states or diﬀer-
ent atomic species. The ﬁrst experiment involving in-
teraction between multiple-species BECs was performed
in rubidium atoms which demonstrated the possibility of
producing long-lived multiple condensate systems [5]. In
particular, the experimental demonstration of trapped
multi-species BECs have spurred great excitement in
atomic physics and stimulated interest in studying vari-
ous properties of two-component BECs [6]. A mixture of
BECs can be produced experimentally by simultaneously
trapping atoms in diﬀerent hyperﬁne states or two iso-
topes of the same element or of diﬀerent species [7]. Re-
cent experimental observations have also shown that the
dark-bright and dark-dark vector solitons can be formed
in certain two-species trapped dilute-gas BECs [8, 9]. In
contrast to the single-component case, such multicompo-
nent condensates can present novel and fundamentally
diﬀerent scenarios for the collective dynamics and coher-
ent structures due to the intercomponent interactions.

Rogue waves (RWs) are random nonlinear waves which
occasionally rise up in the ocean which can attain ampli-
tudes more than twice the value of background wave ﬁeld
[10, 11]. They appear from nowhere and disappear with-

out a trace [12]. RWs were also noticed in a variety of
physical systems such as optical ﬁbers [13], superﬂuids
[14] and capillary waves [15]. It was observed that mod-
ulational instability [16] is responsible for the sudden rise
in the wave amplitude in the ocean [17]. Recently, higher
order rational solutions have been shown to attain even
higher amplitudes of wave in the description of the RW
phenomenon [18]. On the other hand, there has been
a number of studies committed to RWs in coupled non-
linear Schr¨odinger equations (CNLSE). The CNLSE also
models water wave interactions [19] and wave propaga-
tion in ﬁber communication system [13]. The exact ana-
lytical RW solutions of the CNLSE (integrable Manakov
case) [20, 21] and its generalized version have been pre-
sented in [22]. Further, BECs have also been shown to
constitute a good platform to explore the RWs which al-
low one to understand deeply the nature and dynamics
of RWs under laboratory conditions. The possibility of
identifying vector RWs in multi-component BECs pro-
vides us a rich phenomenology of nonlinear wave struc-
tures.

Serkin et al.

have considered the nonautonomous
scalar NLS equation with linear and harmonic oscilla-
tor potentials and explored many speciﬁc features of the
non-autonomous solitons [23]. Followed by this study,
some further interesting studies of the nonautonomous
NLS models with external potentials have also been made
[24–26]. Several works have been exclusively devoted
to construct soliton, RW and breather solutions of one-
component BECs [25–31] and a few studies have been
made to identify the vector soliton and RW solutions
of two coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) [32–
37]. Dynamical evolutions of vector solitons and RWs
have been investigated through managing related phys-
ical variables, see Refs.
[32–35, 37, 38]. Very recently,

Babu Mareeswaran et al.
[36] have studied the interac-
tion of the RW with a dark-bright boomeranic soliton of a
two-component variant of the NLS equation of relevance
to both atomic BECs and nonlinear optics. Furthermore,
they have also examined the robustness of these struc-
tures in direct numerical simulation of the original nonau-
tonomous system. In this paper, we focus our attention
to study the characteristics of vector localized matter
waves in two and three-component BECs with a cigar-
shaped trap. In this work, we ﬁrst contruct several pos-
sible vector localized solutions for two-component BECs,
which can be described by a set of two coupled GPEs
with time-dependent scattering length (which is the non-
linearity parameter) and external trap potential. To cap-
ture localized solutions of this model we map the time-
dependent two coupled GPEs onto the coupled NLSEs
through the similarity transformation method with an
integrability condition between the time-dependent scat-
tering length and the external trap potential. In partic-
ular, we consider three diﬀerent forms of traps, namely
(i) time-independent expulsive trap, (ii) time-dependent
monotonic trap, and (iii) time-dependent periodic trap.
We identify the possibility of vector localized solutions,
namely RWs, dark soliton-RW, bright soliton-RW and
RW-breather-like structures depending upon the speciﬁc
values of a particular parameter in the obtained solu-
tions. We then investigate in detail how the nature of
these localized density proﬁles gets modifed by adjusting
the trap parameter. We depict and analyze the trajec-
tories of the nonautonomous vector RWs. We also con-
struct the dark-dark RW solution for repulsive-repulsive
interaction of the two coupled GPEs and investigate their
dynamical evolution when we tune the strength of the
trap parameter. In the time-independent trap case our
results show that for low values of the trap parameter the
vector localized structures are more stable, due to their
prolonged existence with respect to time. By increas-
ing the trap parameter, the localized structures become
more and more localized in time, that is localized struc-
tures are short-lived, whereas they get stretched or more
delocalized in space in a constant density background. In
the time-dependent monotonic trap case with high value
of the trap parameter, we could not observe any localized
structures while t < 0 because of the form of the nature
of potential. Finally, by replacing the monotonic trap
with the periodic trap potential, the localized structures
exist on a periodic background when the trap parameter
is tuned. One can also observe that the localized waves
lose their stability by way of getting delocalized in space
as the potential strength is increased slowly. While no
rigorous quantitative criteria can be identiﬁed to locate
the point of instability, this can be checked numerically
in the original nonautonomous system.

We then construct composite RW solutions for three-
component BECs which are described by a coupled set of
three GPEs with variable scattering length and external
trap potential. Again, we transform the time-dependent
three coupled GPEs to the three coupled NLS equa-

2

tions under the integrability condition through similarity
transformation method. In Ref. [39], the authors restrict
the parameter values in the obtained generalized RW so-
lutions and discuss the feasibility of single, two and three
composite RWs for three-component NLS systems. They
in fact report that the RW solution exhibits a peculiar
structure, namely a four-petaled structure, in contrast to
the eye-shaped structure of RW. Motivated by this work,
we construct the RW (single, two and three composite
RW) solutions and analyze how to control these local-
ized density proﬁles in three-component BECs. Further-
more we investigate the characteristics of these localized
density proﬁles when we tune the strength of the trap pa-
rameter in the above trap potentials. Our results show
that in the case of time-independent trap potential the
RW structures maintain their stability when the trap pa-
rameter is small and the RW structures become more
and more localized in time and stretched (delocalized)
in space when we increase the trap parameter. Next we
consider the case of time-dependent monotonic trap, and
here also we note that the RW structures are more lo-
calized in time, delocalized in space and reach the higher
density background. Finally, in the time-dependent pe-
riodic trap case, we observe that the RW structures exist
on a periodic background when we adjust the trap pa-
rameter.

In Sec.

The paper is organized as follows.

II, we
present the mean-ﬁeld model
for the two-component
BECs, map the quasi-one-dimensional two coupled GPEs
to the coupled NLSEs by using the similarity transforma-
tion technique which is subjected to a constraint on the
forms of the time-dependent scattering length and the
external trap potential and obtain the general form of
vector RW solutions. The obtained RW solutions can
contribute to control the vector localized structures in
two-component BECs. In Sec. III, we identify diﬀerent
vector localized structures, namely RWs, dark soliton-
RW, bright soliton-RW and RW-breather-like waves for
diﬀerent parameteric values and examine their dynami-
cal evolutions in a constant background when we tune the
strength of the trap parameter in the time-independent
and time-dependent monotonic traps as well as the time-
dependent periodic trap. In Sec. IV, we investigate the
trajectories of the nonautonomous RWs.
In Sec. V,
we construct the dark-dark RW solution for repulsive-
repulsive interaction of two-component BECs and ana-
lyze the associated characteristics for the above three dif-
ferent kinds of traps. In Sec. VI, we consider the mean-
ﬁeld model for the three-component BECs and map
the quasi-one-dimensional time-dependent three coupled
GPEs to a system of three coupled NLSEs again by using
the similarity transformation method. We construct the
RW solutions of the three coupled GPEs by considering
the diﬀerent kinds of traps. The obtained RW solutions
contribute to control and to understand localized density
proﬁles in three-component BECs. We illustrate how the
localized density proﬁles such as the single, two and three
compoite RWs deform in a constant background when

we adjust the trap parameter. Finally, in Sec. VII, we
present a summary of the results and conclusions.

II. MODEL AND REDUCTION

At suﬃciently low temperatures, the properties of a
BEC that is prepared in two hyperﬁne states of conden-
sate atoms can be described by a set of coupled GP equa-
tions of the following form [6, 40],

where the condensate wave functions ψk(~r, t), k = 1, 2,
are normalized by the number of atoms for the two com-

ponents as Nk = R |ψk(~r, t)|2d3r, where mi, i = 1, 2,

are the masses of the atoms of each components, and
Vi(r) are the external potentials. The constants U11, U22
and U12 = U21 are related to the intraspecies scattering
lengths g11 and g22 and the interspecies scattering length
g12 = g21, respectively, by Uij = 2π2gij/mij (i, j =
1, 2), where mij = mimj/(mi + mj) is the reduced mass
for an atom i and an atom j. The self-interaction is at-
tractive in the case gjj < 0 and repulsive for gjj > 0,
whereas the interspecies interaction is repulsive when
g12 = g21 > 0 and attractive when g12 = g21 < 0.
When both intraspecies interaction and interspecies in-
teraction are all equal and time-dependent [32], we can
write g11 = g22 = g12 = g21 = as(t). The potentials
which we consider here are cigar-shaped trap potentials
with the elongated axis in the x-direction which assume
the forms [41]

When the transverse motions of the condensates are
frozen to the ground state in the transverse harmonic
trap potential, that is ωi⊥ ≫ ωi, then the system be-
comes quasi-one-dimensional in nature. Now, we con-
sider the case m1 = m2 and ω1 = ω2 = ω. Then inte-
grating out the transverse coordinates, Eq. (1) can be
rewritten as a system of quasi one-dimensional coupled
GPEs of the form

where ω is the trap frequency in the axial direction and
ω⊥ is the radial trap frequency. For the expulsive poten-
tial the parameter β2(t) is positive (β2(t) > 0), and for
the conﬁning potential it is negative (β2(t) < 0). The na-
ture of intra- and inter-species interactions is determined
by the s-wave scattering length, which can be tuned by
means of magnetic and optical ﬁelds in the vicinity of a
Feshbach resonance (FR) [42, 43]. This FR technique was
utilized experimentally to demonstrate the occurence of
bright solitons as the scattering length is tuned from pos-
itive to negative values [44, 45]. Such possibilities require
the scattering length to be a function of time t [46, 47].
On the other hand, the trap frequency in the elongated
axis ω has also been chosen as a function of time t in
order to study the characteristics of BECs in the trap.
Therefore, the coeﬃcient of nonlinearity (R) and the po-
tential parameter (β) can be time-dependent. Eq. (3)
can be used to describe the management of BECs by
suitably choosing the above two time-dependent param-
eters. The external potential can be of any form relevant
to the experiment. Few widely considered potentials are
(i) linear potential [48], (ii) harmonic oscillator potential
[49], (iii) optical lattice (OL) potential [50] and (iv) ellip-
tic function potential [51]. Notably all these potentials
can be modulated by a time-dependent function. These
potentials are highly eﬃcient tools for controlling and
manipulation of localized matter waves realized in BECs
by tuning the external magnetic ﬁeld and the optically
controlled interactions using the FR technique [52].

In order to study the dynamics of localized density
proﬁles in two-component BECs, we consider the follow-
ing similarity transformation [31, 32] to map the time-
dependent system of two coupled GPEs (3) to the system
of coupled NLSEs,

ψj(x, t) = r(t)Uj (X, T ) exp[iθ(x, t)],

(4)

where r(t) is the amplitude, T (t) is the eﬀective dimen-
sionless time, X(x, t) is the similarity variable and θ(x, t)
is the phase factor which are all to be determined. To de-
termine these unknown functions we substitute (4) into
(3) and obtain a set of polynomial diﬀerential equations
(PDEs) for the unknown functions. Now solving these
PDEs, we obtain the following relations:

r(t) = r0pR(t),

where b and r0 are arbitrary constants. Eq. (3) is in-
tegrable when the nonlinearity parameter R(t) and the
trap potential parameter β(t) satisfy the following inte-

grability condition, namely

which is a Riccati-type equation with dependent vari-
able (Rt/R) and independent variable t. We also note
here that even in the presence of a linear Rabi coupling,
the integrability condition (6) remains unchanged as the
transformation leading to the system (3) can be eﬀected
through a unitary transformation as was done in Ref.
[38]. Here also the integrability condition (6) remains
unsatisﬁed for R constant and β2 a negative constant,
see Ref.
[53]. Using the above relations (5a)-(5d), the
functions Uj(X, T ), j = 1, 2, can be found to satisfy the
system of coupled NLSEs (Manakov system [54]) of the

2, ω = a2,
a1 and a2 are arbitrary real parameters and f is a com-
plex arbitrary constant. The solution (8) is a semi-
rational vector localized solution [20]. A main feature
of this solution is that it has both exponential and ratio-
nal dependence on coordinates. This general form also
yields vector RWs which interact with the soliton waves
for particular choice of parameter values. We note here
that the amplitudes of the RWs of each of the components
diﬀer from each other unlike the previously reported case
of RWs which have same amplitudes in both the compo-
nents [34]. Another interesting property of this solution
is that the RWs coexist with dark-bright solitons when
we vary the complex arbitrary parameter f . We will dis-
cuss these features more elaborately in Section III.

Regardless of the form of R(t), as long as the condition
(6) is satisﬁed, we obtain the general form of solutions of
(3) as

In this section, we shall investigate the characteris-
tics of the semirational, multiparametric vector solutions
(9) of the system of time-dependent one-dimensional two
coupled GPEs (3) with diﬀerent sets of variable scatter-
ing lengths and trap potentials.

where Uj(X, T ), j = 1, 2, are as given in (8). The solu-
tion (9) accomodates the possibility of generating several
localized structures related to RWs, which may be exper-
imentally realizable. Moreover, the solution helps us to
analyze the RW phenomenon relevant to practical situa-
tions such as optics and plasmas [34, 55].

To begin with, we consider the case where the trap
frequency is a time-independent one, that is β2(t) = β2
0 .
When we substitute this in the integrability condition
(6) we can obtain the nonlinearity coeﬃcient to be of the
form R(t) = sech (β0t + δ). Plugging the chosen form of
β(t) and R(t) in (9), we ﬁnd the following RW solution

responds to the analytic solution of Figs. 1(a)-(b).

0/β0 tanh (β0t + δ),
and T (t) = r2
0/(2β0) tanh (β0t + δ). Fig. 1 shows var-
ious types of density proﬁles of the nonlinear localized
matter waves for the time-independent trap frequency
β2(t) = β2
0 and time-dependent scattering length R(t) =
sech (β0t + δ). The particular case, namely f = 0 in Eq.
(10) for Uj(X, T ) as speciﬁed by Eq. (8) is the RW so-
lution, that is the Peregrine soliton. The solution repre-
senting the vector RWs is depicted in terms of |ψ1(x, t)|2
and |ψ2(x, t)|2 when δ = 0.01, a1 = 2.0 and a2 = 0.1
in Figs. 1(a)-(b). The components of RWs reach the
maximum amplitudes approximately at t ≈ 0. The am-
plitudes are diﬀerent in each of the components and are
found to be |ψ1(x, t)|2 ≈ 30 and |ψ2(x, t)|2 ≈ 3. Further,
the RW is unstable: after reaching the maximum value,
and it disappears approximately at t ≈ 1.
Next we consider the case f 6= 0, a1 = 2.0 and a2 = 0
in Eq.
(10) and analyze the existence of the RW and
its interaction with a soliton which propagates with a
nonconstant speed, for diﬀerent values of |f|.
In the
asymptotic limit T → ±∞, the ratios L(X, T )/B(X, T )
and M (X, T )/B(X, T ) in Eq. (8) describe the dark and
bright contributions, respectively, and the individual con-
tributions of the dark shape L/B and bright shape M/B
appear separately when a2 = 0.

When f = 0.25, Figs. 1(c)-(d) show the interaction of
RW with the dark soliton and bright soliton in |ψ1(x, t)|2
and |ψ2(x, t)|2 components, respectively. When we in-
crease the value of f in the parametric RW solution
(10), the single RW merges with the dark-bright soliton
as depicted in Figs. 1(e)-(h). Here we notice that the
density of the ﬁrst component |ψ1(x, t)|2 decreases while
the density of the second component |ψ2(x, t)|2 increases.
The RW completely merges with dark- and bright-soliton
when f = 2.5 as presented in Figs. 1(e)-(f). At f = 15,
the RW cannot be identiﬁed while the resulting dark-
bright distribution appears as a boomeron-type soliton
as shown in Figs. 1(g)-(h). From this discussion we con-
clude that when the value of |f| is low, the RW and
dark-bright solitons separate from each other and when
the value of |f| is increased the RW and dark-bright soli-
tons merge. These facts can be observed in each of the
components.

In the above, we have considered only real values for
the complex parameter f . Now we consider the case
when the parameter f is complex. In this case the so-
lution (10) reveals that the matter waves behave like a
breather. Figs. 1(i)-(j) show breather-like waves result-
ing from the interference between the dark and bright

contributions for f = 0.1i, a1 = 2.5 and a2 = 2.5. When
we decrease the value of |f|, the RW and breather-like
wave get separated from each other which is not shown
here.

For the evidence of presence of the RWs further, we
have also performed a direct numerical simulation of (3)
with the aid of the split-step Crank-Nicolson method us-
ing an initial wave function which is the same as the
function (10) and with space step dx = 0.015 and time
step dt = 0.001 [56]. The computer generated density
proﬁle of the RWs and the corresponding contour plots
are presented in Figs. 2 and 3 with the parameters cho-
sen as r0 = 1.0, c1 = 0.01, β0 = 0.1, f = 0, a1 = 2.0,
a2 = 0.1 and δ = 0.01 which are the same as that of
Figs. 1(a)-(b). The analytically obtained results are in
good agreement with the numerically computed for the
emergence of the RWs. We have also veriﬁed numerically
the existence of RW with dark and bright soliton of (3)
as well, replicating Figs. 1.

In the above investigation we have ﬁxed the strength of
the trap parameter to be rather low at β0 = 0.1. The in-
teraction of RWs with bright and dark solitons represents
the exchange of condensate atoms between the RW and
the soliton/breather and this exchange keeps the struc-
tural stability against the attractive interatomic interac-
tion and trap potential. Now we tune the strength of the
paratemeter β0 to 1.5. Here also we can see the RWs in
each component. The density ﬂuctuations with constant
density background become more and more localized in
time as shown in Figs. 4(a)-(b). From Figs. 4(c)-(d) we
observe that the amplitude of the RW remains constant
whereas the dark and bright solitons exhibit more and
more localization in time and their amplitudes decrease
in space. The ﬁgures reveal that the exchange of atoms
between RW and soliton stretches in space which tells
us that the atoms that constitute the RW and solitons
become more and more localized in time and delocalized
in space. The delocalization of condensate atoms in the
density background is position dependent which can be
observed in Figs. 4(e)-(h). The RW with breather-like
wave in each of the components is more and more local-
ized in time as seen in Figs. 4(i)-(j). Thus, comparing
Figs. 1 and 4, one can conclude that when the interaction
strength β0 is increased, the density proﬁle of the con-
densate atoms suﬀers a collapse in space to a constant
density background whereas it is more localized in time.

B. Time-dependent monotonic trap

Now, we consider a time-dependent trap and investi-
gate how it aﬀects the vector localized structures. The
time-dependent trap frequency which we consider is of

the form β2(t) =(cid:0)β2

bility condition (6), gives the time-dependent interaction
term to be R(t) = 1 + tanh (β0t/2). The general expres-

0 /2(cid:1) [1 − tanh (β0t/2)]. The integra-

ter waves for R(t) = 1 + tanh (β0t/2) and β2(t) =

the previous case (Fig. 1) when the strength of the trap
parameter β0 = 0.1 and so we do not display the outcome
here separately. Figs. 5 show various density proﬁles of
the matter nonlinear localized waves exhibited by the
above forms of β2(t) and R(t) for β0 = 0.7, while the

sin (4β0t)), and T (t) = r2
0/(16β0)(12β0t + 8 sin (2β0t) +
sin (4β0t)).

Here also we obtained the various localized structures
when we vary the parameter f , by ﬁxing β0 = 0.1.
The vector localized structures for the time-dependent
0[1 + 3 tan2(β0t)] and tempo-
periodic trap β2(t) = 2β2
ral periodic modulation of the scattering length R(t) =
1 + cos (2β0t) are similar to the previous two cases and so
we do not display the outcome here separately. Next we
consider a high value of β0. The parameters are kept the
same as in Figs. 1 with β0 = 2.5. Figs. 6(a)-(b) show the
vector RWs exhibited on a periodic wave background for
f = 0. As f is increased from 0.25, we notice that the
amplitude of the RW dissolves into the approaching dark
soliton on a periodic background in |ψ1(x, t)|2 as shown
in Figs. 6(c), (e) and (g). For similar parametric tun-
ing, RWs appear on the bright solitonic background that
folds to localize in positive space in |ψ2(x, t)|2 as shown
in Figs. 6(d) and (f). A further increase in f , the ampli-
tude of RW diminish, with bright soliton localizing in the
positive space as presented in Fig. 6(h). Also the bright
and dark contributions, for complex f , exhibit density
ﬂuctuations of the RW alongside breather like structures
as shown in Figs. 6(i)-(j).

In summary we conclude the following features which
are noted in the above three cases of trap potentials when
the trap parameter β0 is varied. (i) Time-independent
trap: The vector localized structures exhibit more local-
ization in time and delocalization in space. (ii) Time-
dependent monotonic trap: The vector localized struc-
tures (RW and soliton/breather proﬁles) interact only
when t ≥ 0 and for t < 0 the localized structures get
collapsed (disappeared) due to the nature of attractive
potential.
In this
case also the characteristic interaction of the RW and
soliton/breather proﬁles repeat as in the previous two
cases, but on a periodic background.

(iii) Time-dependent periodic trap:

0 [1 + 3 tan2(β0t)].

In Figs. 5(a)-(b),
other parameters are as in Figs. 1.
we observe that the vector RWs exist on a high density
background when β0 = 0.7. From Figs. 5(c)-(j), we can
observe that for t ≤ 0, the localized matter waves tend to
bend and disappear because of decreasing lifetime of the
condensate atoms inside the trap. Figs. 5(c) and Fig.
5(d) show the RW interaction with the bending proﬁle
of dark-soliton of |ψ1(x, t)|2 and the bending proﬁle of
bright-soliton of |ψ2(x, t)|2, respectively, for β0 = 0.7.
Figs. 5(e)-(f) represent the bending vector dark-bright
soliton together with a single RW for each of the compo-
nents. The bending proﬁle of boomeronic type soliton is
shown in Figs. 5(g)-(h). Figs. 5(i)-(j) show the modiﬁed
structure of breather-like waves resulting from the inter-
ference of the dark and bright contributions with the RW
for β0 = 0.7. In this case also we notice that the density
ﬂuctuations of the condensate atoms are more localized
in time and delocalized in space, while for t < 0 the RW
as well as the soliton/breather gets collapsed in each of
the components.

C. Time-dependent periodic trap

Finally, we consider the temporal periodic modula-
tion of the trap potential in the form β2(t) = 2β2
0[1 +
3 tan2(β0t)] for the two-component BECs. The time-
dependent interatomic interaction term is R(t) = 1 +
cos (2β0t) which is consistent with the integrability con-
dition (6). The BEC system exhibits the matter wave

IV. TRAJECTORIES OF THE

NONAUTONOMOUS RW

In this section, we study the characteristics of RW,
namely the evolution of its hump, width (distance be-
tween the two valleys) and the nature of the trajectory
analytically. The trajectory of RW can be described by

the motion of the hump and the valley [57]. When f = 0
in (9) one can obtain the vector RWs of Eq. (3). With
the exact solution of the vector RW solution, we can ﬁnd
the position of the peak (xh) and the two valleys (xv1 and
xv2 ) which appear in the atomic density proﬁles. For this
purpose, we apply the extremum theorem to equation (9),
namely [∂|ψj(x, t)|2/∂x]x=xc = 0, and obtain

R(t) = 1 + cos (2β0t). The vertical axes xc denotes xh, xv1
and xv2 . The solid line represents the hump of RW xh, dashed

RW (corresponding to the |ψ1|2 component) for R(t) =
sech (β0t + δ). The trajectory of the hump of the RW
(xh) is shown by a solid line while the motion of the two
valleys are represented by dotted and dashed lines. Fig.
7(a) gives the trajectories of RW for β0 = 0.1. From the
ﬁgure, we can observe that |ψ1|2
max travels almost in a
straight line in the neighborhood of the origin where the
valleys travel in an ′X ′ shaped path. Near t = 0, the
two valleys come closer to the hump position and give
rise to the localized RW structure. Now increasing the
trap parameter to β0 = 1.5, in Fig. 7(b), we can observe
that the positions of the two valleys are well separated
at t = −2 and they approach closer to each other very
rapidly than in the previous case and give rise to the lo-
callized RW structure near t = 0. Soon after, we can
ﬁnd that the trajectories of both the valleys rapidly de-
viate from each other. In a similar way, we have plotted
the trajectories for two diﬀerent parameter values of RW
for R(t) = 1 + tanh (β0t/2) as shown in Figs. 7(c)-(d).
Similar to the previous case, an increase in β0 causes
rapid changes in the positions of the two valleys. Also
we can ﬁnd that the trajectories of the two valleys are
not symmetric with respect to time for higher values of
β0 (Fig. 7(d)). Similarly the trajectories of the RW for

the time periodic trap case are shown in Figs. 7(e)-(f)
when R(t) = 1 + cos (2β0t). From this ﬁgure, we can
ﬁnd that for a lower value of β0, the trajectories of the
extrema of the RW behave similar to the previous case.
However, for increased value of β0, we ﬁnd that |ψ1|2
max
itself follows a periodic trajectory. From the trajecto-
ries of the valleys, we can ﬁnd that the two valleys come
closer to each other periodically and at t = 0, the two
valleys are found to be the closest. Thus there arises a
periodic wave background around the RW around t = 0.

V. NONAUTONOMOUS DARK-DARK RWS IN

BECS

In the previous sections, we have considered the model
for attractive-attractive interatomic interaction of two-
component BECs and analyzed how the vector localized
density proﬁles behave, namely the vector RW and its
interaction with dark-bright solitons and breather-like
waves have been analyzed. However, BECs exhibit few
other further interesting localized structures as well. The
other predominant structure is the dark-dark RW. Here
we construct the dark-dark RW solutions of the two-
component BECs. To study this we consider the model
for repulsive-repulsive interatomic interaction which is
modelled by the following time-dependent two coupled
quasi one-dimensional GPEs [6],

eters are as deﬁned under Eq. (3). The vector GPE (20)
can also be transformed to a diﬀerent system of coupled
NLSEs through the same similarity transformation as
given in (4). We ﬁnd the unknown functions r(t), θ(x, t),
and X(x, t) have exactly the same form as already given
in (5a)-(5c), but T (t) = − 1
tegrable when the nonlinearity parameter R(t) and the

where g = ±q−4ρ2 − s2 + 2p(2ρ2)2 + 4s2ρ2 and the

criterion for the existence of RW is s2 < 8ρ2. When we
vary the parameter s in the above expression, we identify
two diﬀerent interesting localized structures, namely the
dark-dark RWs, whose amplitudes drop to zero, and the
four-petal conﬁguration dark-dark RWs. In the following
we will discuss in detail how the nature of the dark-dark
RW structures get deformed in a constant density back-
ground when we change the parameter β0.

Regardless of the form of R(t), as long as the condition
(6) is satisﬁed, we obtain the dark-dark RW solutions of

A. Characteristics of dark-dark RWs in BECs

We begin our studies with time-independent trap
β2(t) = β2
0 and R(t) = sech (β0t + δ) which is consis-
tent with the integrability condition (6). With this form

of R(t), we can obtain the dark-dark RW solutions of
the time-dependent two coupled GPEs from Eq. (23).

and 9(c) for the |ψ1(x, t)|2 component and Figs. 9(e) and
9(f) for the |ψ2(x, t)|2 component, respectively. Thus the
nature of the density ﬂuctuations can be controlled by
varying the interaction strength between the atoms.

Next, we consider the case of the time-dependent trap

is varied as (a), (d) β0 = 0.1, (b), (e) β0 = 1.0, and (c), (f)
β0 = 2.5. The other parameters are ρ = 1, s = 1.0, r0 = 1.0,

β0 = 1.0, and (c), (f) β0 = 2.5. The other parameters are
ρ = 1, s = 0.5, r0 = 1.0, b = 0.01, and δ = 0.01.

Figs. 8(a) and 8(d) show the corresponding contour plots
of the density proﬁles of dark-dark matter RWs for the
strength of the trap parameter β0 = 0.1. When we tune
the interaction strength β0 the density proﬁles of dark
RWs (the density ﬂuctuations of condensate atoms in the
constant density background) become more and more lo-
calized in time as shown in Figs. 8(b) and 8(c) for the
|ψ1(x, t)|2 component and |ψ2(x, t)|2 component in Figs.
8(e) and 8(f), respectively. Fig. 9 displays the density
proﬁles of dark-dark matter RWs in a four-petal conﬁg-
uration for the same above forms of β2(t) and R(t) as a
function of β0. The qualitative nature of the dark RW
pair in the four-petal conﬁguration is shown in Figs. 9(a)
and 9(d) for the strength of the trap parameter β0 = 0.1.
As β0 is increased, we obtain a deformed structure, that
is the density ﬂuctuations are more and more localized
in time and delocalized in space as seen from Figs. 9(b)

The parameter β0 is varied as (a), (d) β0 = 0.1, (b), (e)
β0 = 1.0, and (c), (f) β0 = 2.5. The other parameters are
ρ = 1, s = 1.0, r0 = 1.0, c1 = 0.01, and δ = 0.01.

we present a pair of dark RWs for these choices of R(t)
and β2(t). When β0 = 0.1 the dark-dark RWs are as
shown in Figs. 10(a) and 10(d). By tuning the value
of the interaction strength β0, the structure of the dark-
dark RWs collapses when t ≤ 0 and the density ﬂuctu-
ations of atoms get settled at diﬀerent constant density
backgrounds as seen from Figs. 10(b) and 10(c) for the
|ψ1(x, t)|2 component and Figs. 10(e) and 10(f) for the
|ψ2(x, t)|2 component, respectively. The density proﬁles

of the corresponding vector RWs in a four-petal conﬁg-

uration are presented in Fig. 11. The vector dark RWs
in the deformed structure of four-petal conﬁguration for
β0 = 0.1 is shown in Figs. 11(a) and 11(d). When the
strength of trap parameter β0 is increased, we observe
that the structures are modiﬁed which are shown in Figs.
11(b) and 11(e). On further increasing the value of the
strength of the trap parameter β0 to 2.5, we notice that a
pair of density proﬁles acquire a modiﬁed structure and
reach a higher density background when t ≥ 0 which is
displayed in Figs. 11(c) and 11(f).
Finally, we consider the temporal periodic modulation

of the trap potential β2(t) = 2β2
two-component BECs. In accordance with the integra-
bility condition (6) the time-dependent interatomic in-
teraction term is R(t) = 1 + cos (2β0t). Figs. (12)-(13)

where ψj, j = 1, 2, 3, are the condensate wave functions

the nonlinearity parameter R(t) describes the variation of
scattering length and can be controlled well by Feshbach
resonance [42, 43, 52] and β2(t) is the trap potential pa-
rameter. The time-dependent three coupled GPEs (24)
is, in general, non-integrable and in order to study the
dynamics of (24), we can map the three component GPEs
(24) to a set of three coupled NLSEs under the similar-
ity transformation (4). The unknown functions of r(t),
θ(x, t), R(t) and β(t) are as given in Eqs. (5a), (5b) and
(6), respectively and the function Uj(X, T ) can be found
to satisfy the set of three coupled NLSEs of the form as

where Uj(X, T ), j = 1, 2, 3 is the above solution (26) of
the coupled NLSEs (25). The complete integrability of
Eq.
(25) was studied in [39]. As we are interested in
the RW solutions of (24) we invoke only this solution for
(25) as reported in [39]. We do not reproduce the explicit
forms of Hj and Dj, j = 1, 2, 3, in (26) here due to their
lengthy nature but use these expressions in our further
analysis.

A. Characteristics of the nonautonomous RW in

three-component BECs

We discuss the characteristics of RW solutions of
time-dependent one-dimensional system of three coupled
GPEs with diﬀerent kinds of variable scattering lengths
and trap potentials, as in the case of two-component
BECs in the earlier sections.

1. Time-independent trap

Substituting the nonlinearity parameter R(t) =
trap parameter
sech (β0t + δ) and time-independent
β2(t) = β2
0 in (27), we can obtain the RW solution
of the time-dependent three coupled GPEs, ψj(x, t) =
r0psech (β0t + δ) Uj(X, T ) exp(iχ(x, t)),
j = 1, 2, 3,
with χ(x, t) as given in (10) and U1(X, T ), U2(X, T )
and U3(X, T ) are as given in (26) with X(x, t) =
r0sech (β0t + δ)x − br3
0/β0 tanh (β0t + δ), and T (t) =
r2
0/(2β0) tanh (β0t + δ). This solution with four free pa-
rameters namely A1, A2, A3 and A4 is very lengthy and so
we do not give the explicit expression here and analyze
the results only graphically. With suitable restrictions
on the parameters A1, A2, A3 and A4 we obtain diﬀerent
RW structures in this system (24). For example (i) when
A3 = 0, A4 = 0 and A1, A2 6= 0, we obtain a single RW
in each component, (ii) A4 = 0, and A1, A2, A3 6= 0, we
extract two composite RWs in each component and (iii)
when A4 6= 0, we obtain three composite RWs in the x−t
plane. In the following, we discuss these three cases one
by one by choosing the trap parameter as β0 = 0.1.

Figs. 14-17 show three diﬀerent kinds of matter RWs
for time-independent harmonic trap potential parame-
ter β2(t) = β2
0 and time-dependent scattering length
parameter R(t) = sech (β0t + δ). Here we consider the
parameters A3 = 0 and A4 = 0 in the obtained solu-
tion. Fig. 14 represents the density proﬁles of single
RWs, |ψ1(x, t)|2, |ψ2(x, t)|2 and |ψ3(x, t)|2 of (24). We
can see that the density distribution shapes of the matter
RWs in |ψ1(x, t)|2 and |ψ3(x, t)|2 are quite distinct from
|ψ2(x, t)|2. From Figs. 14(a) and 14(c), we observe two

12

humps and two valleys around a center and the position
of the center is almost equal to that of the background,
giving the appearance of a four-petaled structure. This
structure can be clearly seen in the contour plots, Figs.
14(d) and 14(f), respectively. On the other hand, the
density distribution in the |ψ2|2 component appears sim-
ilar to that of the RW in a single component system for
which there are one hump and two valleys, as presented
in Figs. 14(b) and 14(e). In each component, the RW
disappears when it reaches the maximum, thus revealing
the unstable nature of RWs. We also note that the am-
plitudes in their components |ψ1(x, t)|2, |ψ3(x, t)|2 ≈ 2
and |ψ2(x, t)|2 ≈ 4. In Fig. 14, the second panel shows
the corresponding contour plots of (a), (b) and (c).

FIG. 14. (Color online) The density proﬁles of the RWs of
three-component BEC system (24). (a), (c) Four-petaled RW
in the components |ψ1(x, t)|2 and |ψ3(x, t)|2 and (b) single RW
structure in |ψ2(x, t)|2 for R(t) = sech (β0t + δ) and β2(t) =
β2
0 . (d), (e) and (f) are the corresponding contour plots of (a),
(b) and (c). The parameters are chosen as A1 = 1, A2 = 5,
A3 = 0, A4 = 0, r0 = 1.0, β0 = 0.1, b = 0.01, and δ = 0.01.

Next we restrict only the parameter A4 = 0 in the
obtained RW solutions for (24). Here we observe two
composite RWs in each component. When A1 ≤ 0, two
composite RWs exist at a certain time, as shown in Figs.
15(a)-(c). The four-petaled RWs arise in |ψ1,3|2 which are
shown in Figs. 15(a) and (c) and the single RW emerges
in the |ψ2|2 component which is presented in Fig. 15(b).
Two composite RWs arise at two diﬀerent times, when
A1 ≥ 0, which is shown in Figs. 15(d)-(i). The inter-
actions of the two matter RWs are also shown in these
ﬁgures, when A1 = 80. When we increase the parame-
ter to A1 = 120, the two RWs separate from each other
which is demonstrated in Figs. 15(h)-(i). Thus each of
the components ψj(x, t), j = 1, 2, 3, show two composite
matter RWs in the case of the three-component GPEs
(24).

When all the parameters A1, A2, A3 and A4 are
nonzero, we obtain three composite RWs in each of the
components. At A4 = −1, we can observe three compos-
ite RWs at a particular time, as shown in Figs. 16(a)-(c).
The four-petaled structure of RWs appear in |ψ1,3|2 com-

The other parameters are the same as in Fig. 14.

ponents as displayed in Figs. 16(a) and 16(c) and three
separated RWs arise in the |ψ2|2 component as exhib-
ited in Fig. 16(b). Next, we choose A4 to be positive
and demonstrate the interactions of the three compos-
ite RWs as shown in Figs. 17(a)-(c). Thus each one of
the components ψj(x, t), j = 1, 2, 3, show triple vector
matter RWs.

interactions of three composite RWs (a)-(c) for the parameters
A1 = 150, A2 = 250, A3 = 120 and A4 = 50. The other
parameters are same as in Fig. 14.

FIG. 16. (Color online) Contour plots corresponding to three
composite RWs (a)-(c) for the parameters A1 = 10, A2 = 50,
A3 = 2 and A4 = 5. The other parameters are same as in
Fig. 14.

FIG. 18. (Color online) (a), (c) Four-petaled RW and (b) RW
structure, and (d), (e) and (f) are the corresponding contour
plots of (a), (b) and (c). The parameters are same as in Fig.
14 with β0 = 1.2.

Figs. 18-21 depict the qualitative nature of a diﬀerent
set of localized density proﬁles of (24). Typical distribu-
tions of |ψ1(x, t)|2, |ψ2(x, t)|2 and |ψ3(x, t)|2 components
show how the nature of RW structures get modiﬁed in
a constant density background when we adjust the trap
parameter β0. For this investigation we ﬁxed all the pa-
rameters as the same as in the previous discussion and
we only increase the value of the parameter β0 to 1.2. In
Figs. 18(a)-(c), we observe the four-petaled RW struc-
ture and the RW compresses in time and stretches (de-
localize) in space. The corresponding contour plots are
presented in Figs. 18(d)-(f). We then examine the two
composite RWs when we alter the strength of the trap
parameter. The modiﬁed structure of the two compos-

ite RWs is as shown in Figs. 19(a)-(i). This ﬁgure re-
veals that the density distribution of condensate atoms
get more and more localized in time and delocalized in
space. We now analyze the case of the three composite
RWs. In Figs. 20(a)-(c), we observe that three composite
RWs become more localized in time and delocalization of
condensate atoms are position dependent. We note here
that the RW structure gets more and more localilzed in
time and delocalized in space and two RWs of them disap-
pear which are displayed in Figs. 21(a)-(c). In the above,
we have monitored how the RW structures get modiﬁed
in a constant density background which corresponds to
the phenomenon of condensate atoms getting exchanged

1, A2 = 5, A3 = 0, A4 = 0,r0 = 1.0, β0 = 1.2, b = 0.01, and
δ = 0.01.

In Figs. 22-25 we display the qualitative nature of dif-
ferent localized density proﬁles for time-dependent har-

0/2(cid:1) [1 − tanh (β0t/2)]

monic trap potential β(t)2 = (cid:0)β2

and interatomic interaction R(t) = 1 + tanh (β0t/2). By
keeping the trap parameter β0 = 0.1, we obtain the RW
density proﬁles which are the same as what we observed
in the previous case and so we do not repeat the discus-
sion here. We observe the following features when we
alter the trap parameter. Here, we consider all the other
parameters as the same as in the previous case and we
vary the parameter β0 from 0.1 to 1.2. In Figs. 22(a) and
22(c), we note that the four-petaled RW structure delo-
calize in space and reach a higher density background
In Fig. 22(b), we observe that the RW
when t ≥ 0.
get more localized in the constant background. The de-
formed two composite RWs under change in the strength
of the trap parameter are as shown in Figs. 23(a)-(i).
The three composite RWs bend in the constant back-
ground as presented in Figs. 24(a)-(c). The interactions
of the three RW structure make them to delocalize in
space which is represented in Figs. 25(a)-(c). We con-
clude here that when we tune the strength of the trap
parameter the density proﬁles of the RW structures get
delocalized in space and reach a high density background.

between the RW and its background. This exchange of
atoms allows the system to maintain the constant back-
ground of the RW even while varying the trap parameter.

3. Time-dependent periodic trap

Finally, we consider the temporal periodic modula-
0[1 + 3 tan2(β0t)]
tion of the trap potential β2(t) = 2β2
for the three-component BECs.
In accordance with
the integrability condition (6), we have the time-
dependent interatomic interaction term as R(t) =
1 + cos (2β0t).
Using the above forms into (27),
we have the RW solution of the form ψj(x, t) =
r0p1 + cos (2β0t) Uj(X, T ) exp(χ(x, t)),
j = 1, 2, 3,
with χ(x, t) as given in (12) and U1(X, T ), U2(X, T ) and
U3(X, T ) as given in (26) with X(x, t) = 2r0 cos2 (β0t)x−
br3
0/8β0(12β0t + 8 sin (2β0t) + sin (4β0t)), and T (t) =
r2
0/(16β0)(12β0t + 8 sin (2β0t) + sin (4β0t)). Here also we
obtain the various localized structures when we vary the
parameter Aj , j = 1, 2, 3, 4 and by ﬁxing β0 = 0.1. The
vector localized structures are similar to the previous two
cases and so we do not display the outcome here sep-
arately. The parameters are same as in Fig. 14 with
β0 = 2.5. In this case, the density proﬁles of |ψ1(x, t)|2,
|ψ2(x, t)|2 and |ψ3(x, t)|2 show that single, two and three
composite RWs exist on a periodic background as shown
in Figs. 26-29.

RW and (b) RW structure for R(t) = 1 + cos (2β0t) and

δ = 0.01.

and A4 = 0. The other parameters are same as in Fig. 26.

acteristics of these localized solutions when we tune the
strength of the trap parameter. We have depicted the
trajectories of nonautonomous RWs. We have then con-
structed the dark-dark RW solutions for two-component
BECs and investigated the correlated characteristics for
the above trap potentials. Our results show that in the
case of time-independent trap potential, the RW struc-
tures maintain their stability by considering a lower value
of trap parameter and then by increasing the trap param-
eter we ﬁnd that the RW structures get more localized in
time and stretched in space in a constant density back-
ground. In the case of time-dependent monotonic trap,
the localized structures get compressed in time, delocal-
ized in space and collapse also occurs when t < 0 in each
of the components due to the form of nature of poten-
tial.
In the case of periodic trap potential, RWs with
soliton structures exist on a periodic background when
we alter the trap parameter. We have then constructed
the general RW solutions for the mean-ﬁeld model of
three-component BECs. By restricting the parameters
appearing in the obtained RW solutions, we have identi-
ﬁed localized structures such as single, double and triple
RWs for these trap potentials. We have analyzed how
these localized density proﬁles get modiﬁed in the den-
sity background when we alter the trap parameter. Our
results show that in the case of time-independent trap
potential the RW structures keep their stability when
the trap parameter is small and the RWs get more local-
ized in time and stretched in space when we increase the
trap parameter. In the case of time-dependent monotonic
trap, RW structures become compressed in time, delocal-
ized in space and settled at a higher density background.
In the time-dependent periodic trap case, the RW struc-
tures emerge on a periodic background when we adjust
the trap parameter. Our results provide evidence for the
existence of diﬀerent possibilities to manipulate RWs ex-
perimentally in multi-component BEC systems.

VII. CONCLUSION

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

In conclusion, we have constructed several localized so-
lutions of two coupled GPEs which describe the dynamics
of the two-component BECs with time-dependent scat-
tering lengths and time-dependent harmonic trap poten-
tials. We have mapped the time-dependent two coupled
GPEs onto two coupled NLSEs subject to an integra-
bility condition between the time-dependent nonlinear-
ity coeﬃcient and the external trap potential through
a similarity transformation technique. We have con-
sidered three diﬀerent trap potentials, namely (i) time-
independent trap, (ii) time-dependent monotonic trap
and (iii) time-dependent periodic trap. We have iden-
tiﬁed diﬀerent localized wave structures, namely RWs,
dark soliton-RW, bright soliton-RW and RW-breather-
like structures for diﬀerent values of particular parame-
ters in the obtained solutions. We have studied the char-
