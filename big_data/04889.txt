In contrast to strong projective measurement, which freezes the system
Abstract.
evolution by quantum Zeno eﬀect, weak measurement can eﬀectively compete with
standard unitary dynamics leading to nontrivial eﬀects. Here we consider global weak
measurement addressing several bosonic modes at the same time, thus preserving
quantum superpositions due to the lack of which path information. While for certainty
we focus on ultracold atoms, the idea can be generalized to other multimode quantum
systems,
including various quantum emitters, optomechanical arrays, and purely
photonic systems with multiple-path interferometers. We show that light scattering
from ultracold bosons in optical lattices can be used for deﬁning macroscopically
occupied spatial modes that exhibit long-range coherent dynamics. Even for constant
external measurement, the quantum measurement backaction acts on the atomic
ensemble quasi-periodically and induces collective oscillatory dynamics of all the atoms.
We introduce an eﬀective model for the evolution of the spatial modes and present an
analytic solution showing that the quantum jumps drive the system away from its
stable point. We conﬁrm our ﬁnding describing the atomic observables in terms of
stochastic diﬀerential equations.

1. Introduction

Quantum measurement is one of the most intriguing aspects of quantum mechanics.
Many of its unusual manifestations have been already demonstrated, which includes
quantum jumps and quantum Zeno eﬀect.
In particular, intriguing quantum states
of photons such as Fock and Schrödinger cat states were prepared using measurement
backaction [1, 2]. In a typical scenario, continuous measurement leads to projection to a
well-deﬁned state. Here, we focus on an essentially many-body (or multimode) version,
where there are many particles (modes) indistinguishable by the measurement. Thus
the measurement is collective and preserves quantum superposition for indistinguishable
emitters. In addition, the measurement is weak, thus it can compete with the unitary
dynamics [3]. We discuss the result of such a competition. Although for certainty we
consider ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices, the idea can be applied to other
arrays of quantum emitters, e.g. superconducting qubits as used in circuit cavity QED
[4, 5, 6, 7], matter waves scattering [8], Rydberg [9, 10] and other polaritonic and spin
excitations [11], optomechanical arrays [12, 13], and even purely photonic systems with
multiple path interference (where, similarly to optical lattices, the quantum walks and
boson sampling were discussed [14, 15, 16, 17]).

Ultracold gases trapped in optical

lattice are an extremely ﬂexible tool

for
studying the behaviour of matter in the degenerate regime [18]. The possibility of
realizing a vast range of Hamiltonians with highly tunable parameters make these
systems suitable for studying phenomena from diﬀerent disciplines, from condensed
matter to particle physics. Recent experimental breakthrough [19, 20] succeeded in
coupling these systems to optical cavities, opening the possibility of merging the
ﬁeld of ultracold gases to quantum optics and realizing the ultimate regimes where
the quantum nature of both matter and light is equally important [21, 22]. These
new experiments enable the study of novel eﬀects where the atomic interactions are
mediated by the light ﬁeld [23, 24, 25, 26], enriching the phenomenology of these
systems and leading to new quantum phases. Moreover, the entanglement between
the light and matter degrees of freedom is at the core of several quantum nondemolition
proposals [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34] where atomic properties are inferred from the
observation of the scattered light.

We focus on the measurement backaction on the atomic state due to the detection of
the photons escaping the cavity. This eﬀect competes with the usual atomic dynamics
and can be exploited for engineering interesting quantum states (with [35, 36, 37] or
without [3, 38] the need of external control) and tayloring quantum Zeno dynamics [39].
We consider a spatially structured measurement scheme which partitions the system
in multiple spatial modes with non-trivial overlap [40] and we focus on the evolution
of the atomic wavefunction in a single experimental run. We formulate an eﬀective
description of the dynamics of the system in terms of collective variables characterizing
each spatial mode. Depending on the spatial structure of the measurement operator, the
detection process can induce induce dynamical multi-mode macroscopic superposition

Figure 1. Setup. An optical lattice is probed with a coherent light beam (red) and
the scattered light is enhanced by an optical cavity (blue). Depending on the angle
between the two beams, the measurement deﬁnes macroscopically occupied spatial
modes which maintain long-range coherence (represented by atoms of the same color).

states which preserve long-range coherence. We present an analytically solvable model
valid in the case of two spatial modes which shows how the quantum jumps drive the
atomic system away from its stationary point, capturing the emergence of large-scale
collective oscillations with increasing amplitude. We conﬁrm our ﬁndings by studying
the stochastic diﬀerential equations that govern the evolution of the atomic observables.

2. Theoretical Model

We consider a system of N ultracold bosons loaded in an optical lattice with M lattice
sites that scatter light into a cavity with cavity decay κ (Figure 1). The cavity enhances
the light scattered in a particular direction and provides a way to continuously monitor
the atomic system detecting the photons that leak through the mirrors [41, 42, 43]. We
model the evolution of the atomic system using the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian

This model can be also generalized to Fermi systems introducing the light polarization
as additional degree of freedom which allows to selectively probe diﬀerent spin states
[44, 45] triggering the formation of antiferromagnetic states [38, 46]. In this work, we
consider the case where only two light modes are present: the classical coherent probe
a0 and the cavity mode a1. Within these assumptions, we can compute the stationary
limit of the cavity annihilation operator as a1 = C ˆF10 where C is the Rayleigh scattering
coeﬃcient C = iΩ10a0/(i∆p − κ). Moreover, for deep optical lattices the operator ˆD10
dominates over ˆB10 so that the light operator describing the photons escaping the cavity
is a1 = C ˆD10.

The coeﬃcients Jjj can be easily engineered changing the light mode function. If Jjj
has the same value in a region of the optical lattice, atoms in this partition scatter light
with the same intensity and phase, making them indistinguishable by the measurement.
Importantly, this is a consequence of global coupling between the atoms and the light
mode: all the lattice sites scatter light coherently into the cavity. This is in contrast to
recent monitoring schemes that rely on local addressing [47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53] where
each atom scatter light independently (i. e. there is a jump operator ˆcj for each lattice
site) and the measurement process quickly destroys long-range coherence. If both light
¯) = eik
¯l·r
modes are traveling waves (ul(r
¯) and considering a one-dimensional chain, the
coeﬃcient Jjj are analogous to a classical diﬀraction grating, i. e. Jjj = eiδj where δ
is the projection of the diﬀerence between the wave vectors of the light modes on the
direction of the optical lattice. Tuning the angle between probe and scattered light
so that δ = 2πs/R (s, R ∈ Z), the optical lattice is partitioned in R macroscopically
occupied spatial modes where atoms separated by R lattice sites cannot be distinguished
by the measurement. In this geometrical conﬁguration, the dynamics of the system is
determined by the evolution of the collective variables characterizing the modes and not
by the occupation of each lattice site.

We focus on the conditional dynamics in a single experimental realization and we
model the evolution of the system with the quantum trajectories technique [54]. Within
this formalism, the photodetections are described by the application of the quantum
jump operator ˆc =
2κˆa1 (which follows a stochastic process) while the dynamics
between two photocounts is determined by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian

The second term of this expression deﬁnes an additional energy scale γ = |C|2κ for the
system which competes with the usual local processes that describe the evolution of the

If the interaction between the atoms can be neglected (U = 0), the dynamics resulting
from the competition between the measurement process and the usual nearest-neighbors
tunneling preserves the mode structure and it is possible to describe the system in term
of collective variables. To clarify this, we rewrite the tunneling term in equation (1) as

conditional dynamics of the system in term of an eﬀective double-well problem where
the occupation of the two wells corresponds to the population of the spatial modes.
However, this approach does not allow us to compute any spatial correlations for the
system considered: only “collective” properties can be calculated.

operator is ˆc ∝ (cid:80)3

The generalization of (11) to the case of R modes is straightforward: from the spatial
structure of the jump operator one can compute the amplitude of the tunneling processes
between diﬀerent spatial modes and build an eﬀective R−wells problem. Moreover,
the coupling between the eﬀective wells can be tuned changing the spatial structure
of the measurement operator, allowing us to go beyond simple double-well systems
[60, 61]. For example, considering the case of R = 3 spatial modes generated by a
measurement scheme where the light mode functions are traveling waves and the jump
j=1 ei2πj/3 ˆNj, one has that the modes alternates across the lattice
as RGBRGB . . .. Therefore, each lattice site belonging to the mode R is connected
to one site of mode G and one of mode B (indexes can be cycled) so that tunneling
processes are allowed between all the modes. This reduces the system to a three-wells
problem where a speciﬁc linear combination of the atomic populations ˆNj is monitored
while the atoms are free to hop between the three diﬀerent wells. Importantly, this is
not the only possible way to divide the optical lattice in three modes:
if probe and
¯ = π/4, the resulting Jjj coeﬃcients
scattered light are standing waves such that k
are [0, 1/2, 1, 1/2, 0, . . .] and the modes alternates as RGBGRGBGR . . .. In this case,
tunneling is not allowed between mode R and B and the coupling between the eﬀective
three-wells describing the conditional dynamics must take this into account by forbidding
atomic transfer between two of the eﬀective wells.

The measurement scheme we consider addresses global atomic observables and
therefore preserves long range coherence. Moreover, the spatial structure of the jump
operator determines the conditional dynamics: eventual degeneracy of the light intensity
(cid:104)ˆa
1ˆa1(cid:105) are imprinted on the state of the atoms. For example, if one detects the photons
†
scattered in the diﬀraction minimum, so that the measurement addresses the diﬀerence
in the population of the two spatial modes deﬁned by the odd and even lattice sites, i.
e. ˆa1 = C( ˆNe − ˆNo), the photon number operator is not sensitive to the sign of such
diﬀerence. This is because states with opposite (cid:104) ˆNe − ˆNo(cid:105) scatter light with diﬀerent
phase but with the same intensity. As a consequence of the measurement backaction,
the atomic state becomes a superposition of two macroscopically occupied components:
a Schrödinger cat state. If the monitoring scheme deﬁnes more than two degenerate
modes, the conditional evolution leads to an atomic wavefunction that can be expressed
as a superposition of multiple macroscopically occupied components. Importantly, this
property is a consequence of the spatial structure of the jump operator and does not only
depend on the number of modes deﬁne by the measurement. For example, considering
the case of three modes arranged as RGBRGB . . . (Jjj=ei2πj/3), the photon number
(cid:104)ˆa
1ˆa1(cid:105) is invariant under the exchange of any two light modes and, as a consequence,
†
the probability distribution of the population of each mode presents three oscillating
peaks, indicating that the atomic state conditioned to the measurement is a multimode
Schrödinger cat state. However, if the spatial modes have a diﬀerent structure such as
RGBGRGBGR . . . (Jjj = [0, 1/2, 1, 1/2, 0, . . .]) this is not the case: only the modes B
and G can be exchanged without aﬀecting the intensity of the detected light. Therefore,

Collective dynamics of multimode bosonic systems

in this case the probability distribution of the occupation of the mode R has a single
peaks while the ones for modes G and B are bimodal. This is illustrated in Figure 2
where, depending on the measurement scheme, the photodetection induces diﬀerent
dynamics.

the dynamics described by the interaction operator (cid:80)

The local interaction term in Eq. (1) tends to localize the atoms on each lattice
site and cannot be included exactly in the approximation we presented. This is because
i ˆni(ˆni − 1) is not internal to
the subspace SR. For weak interactions and assuming that the measurement scheme
partitions the optical lattice in R spatial modes, we ﬁnd that the interaction energy U
is rescaled by the number of lattice sites belonging to each mode (Mj) so that

Note that this expression is approximate and does not allow to describe the strong
interacting limit where the atoms form a Mott insulator state. Despite of this
limitation, the model we presented allows to describe interacting systems where synthetic
interactions mediated by the light ﬁeld couple diﬀerent spatial modes [62].

4. Probing the odd sites of the optical lattice

If the measurement operator probes the population of the odd sites of the optical lattice,
i. e. a1 = C ˆNo, we can formulate an analytic description of the atomic dynamics [63].
In between the quantum jumps, the evolution of the system is deterministic and it is
determined by the matrix elements of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (11):

Expanding this expression up to second order in h and deﬁning the normalized

Therefore, the dynamics of the atomic system is mapped to the evolution of a Gaussian
wave packet in an harmonic potential and subjected to dissipation via the non-Hermitian
term due to the measurement. Within these assumptions, the wavefunction of the system
remains Gaussian at all times and it can be expressed as

The functions b2(t), z0(t), c(t), φ(t) and a(t) describe the collective dynamics of the
system. Speciﬁcally, b2(t) is proportional to the width of the atomic distribution, z0(t)
is the mean value of the unbalance (i. e. (cid:104) ˆNo − ˆNe(cid:105)) while c(t) and φ(t) are phase
diﬀerences between superﬂuid states with diﬀerent populations. Moreover, Re [a(t)]
describes the global phase of the wavefunction and Im [a(t)] its norm. Importantly, all
these functions are real with the exception of a(t) which is complex. Finally, from the

Collective dynamics of multimode bosonic systems

Schrödinger equation (16) we obtain the diﬀerential equations that dictate the evolution
of b2(t), z0(t), c(t), φ(t) and a(t). Speciﬁcally, one can prove that

Equations (22-25) can be solved analytically introducing the auxiliary variables

Finally, from these solutions we can extract the physical observables of equations (22-
25) as b2(t) = 1/Re [p(t)], φ(t) = −Im [p(t)] /Re [p(t)], z0(t) = Re [q(t)] /Re [p(t)] and
c(t) = 2Im [q(t)] /Re [p(t)].

Instead of focusing on the full solution, here we give a qualitative description of
the dynamics generated by these equations. Speciﬁcally, we compute the eigenvalues
of the Jacobian matrix of the system (22-25) in its stationary points. Studying the
stationary point of the dynamical equations (22-25) or (27-28), we ﬁnd that there is
only one physical critical point. Deﬁning the parameter

Since all of them have a non-positive real part, the point (b2, φ, z0, c) deﬁned by (36-
39) is stable. Therefore, the evolution of the system in the long time limit will tend
to dumped oscillations around the stationary point with frequency Ω = 2Γ/(ωα) and
decay time ∆td = 1/(2Jωα). The ratio between the measurement strength Γ and the
tunneling amplitude J determines if the oscillatory behavior is under- or over-damped.
The predictions of this analytic model agree quantitatively with the dynamics described
by (13) only if the population imbalance between the two spatial modes is small. Despite
of this, we ﬁnd that this simple formulation captures the qualitative behavior of b2 and
z0 and help explaining the emergence of the collective oscillations between odd and even
sites.

The quantum jumps substantially contribute the evolution of the atomic state and
drastically alter the dynamics described by (22-25). Their eﬀect can be included in the
model by expanding the jump operator a1 = C(z +1)/2 around the peak of the Gaussian
wavefunction (21) as

Neglecting the non-Hermitian dynamics these equations imply that each quantum
jump tends to squeeze the width of the atomic distribution while it increases the
atom imbalance between odd and even sites (see Figure 3). As a consequence, the
measurement process decreases the uncertainty in the population of the spatial modes
and the atomic state becomes a product of two superﬂuid states with well-deﬁned atom
number. In the next paragraphs, we will discuss how the quantum jumps compete with
the eﬀective non-unitary dynamics, leading to the creation of states where the atomic
population collectively oscillates between odd and even sites.

4.1. Case J = 0

We ﬁrst start by considering the case when the atomic tunneling is much slower than
the measurement and J can be neglected. Within this assumption, the evolution of the
system between two quantum jumps is solely determined by the non-Hermitian dynamics
which, together with the quantum jumps, decreases the variance of the population
imbalance between odd and even sites. Therefore, the ﬁnal state of the system is
a product of two superﬂuids with a well-deﬁned number of atoms for each quantum
trajectory and the behavior of b(t) is almost deterministic [64]. However, the imbalance
between odd and even sites is not the same for each quantum trajectory since it is
determined by the speciﬁc sequence of quantum jumps. In fact, the photodetections or

Figure 4. Close orbits around the stable point for the width of the atomic distribution
(b2, ˙b2) (a) and the population imbalance (z0, ˙z0) (b) in a single trajectory setting Γ = 0
and without jumps. The black point marks the initial state (b2 = 2h, z0 = 0) while
the red one marks the stationary point. Panel (b) does not show any dynamics since
the initial state and the stationary point coincide.

the non-Hermitian decay dominates the dynamics of z0 in opposite regimes: the ﬁrst
eﬀect is predominant if the occupation in the odd sites is large while the second one
is favored by a large occupation of the even sites. In each quantum trajectory, these
two phenomena balance each other and, in the long time limit, z0 reaches a stationary
value which follows the Gaussian probability distribution deﬁned by the initial state
(19), favoring states with small population diﬀerence between odd and even sites.

4.2. Case J (cid:54)= 0
If the tunneling amplitude J cannot be neglected, the detection process competes with
the usual atomic dynamics. We ﬁrst consider the weak measurement limit Γ (cid:28) J so
that we can describe the evolution of the system between two quantum jumps setting
Γ ≈ 0 in (22-25). From the stability analysis we ﬁnd that the stable point of the system
is b(∞) ≈ 4h/ω and z0(∞) ≈ 0 while the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix are purely
imaginary, i. e. λ1,2 = ±iJω and λ3,4 = ±2iJω. Therefore, in absence of quantum
jumps, the solutions of (22-25) are oscillating around the stable point without damping
(see Figure 4). The photodetections perturb this regular oscillations and drive the
system quasi-periodically, leading to giant oscillations in the population of the spatial
modes. Speciﬁcally, the quantum jumps tend to increase the value of z0 according to
(42-45) and consequently, the radius of the oscillations in the (z0, ˙z0) plane is increasing
if a jump happens when z0 > 0 while it is decreasing when z0 < 0. Importantly, these
two processes do not happen with the same rate because the probability for the emission
of a photon in the time interval δt depends on the atomic state and it is given by

Figure 5. Oscillations of (b2, ˙b2) (a) and (z0, ˙z0) (b) in a single quantum trajectory
setting Γ = 0 and applying jumps according to the exact diagonalization solution (11).
The black point represents the initial state (b2 = 2h, z0 = 0) while the red one marks
the stationary point. The solutions rotate around the stable point with increasing
amplitude. Note that the jumps are from right to left for b2 while they are from left
to right for z0.

Therefore, jumps that increase the radius of the oscillations happen more often and
increase the amplitude of the oscillations of z0(t) (see Figure 5). In order to conﬁrm this
prediction, we now turn to the full measurement problem. Taking into account the non-
Hermitian dynamics in the diﬀerential equations for b(t) and z(t), the radius of the orbits
shown in Figure 4 decreases exponentially. Therefore, we can identify three diﬀerent time
scales in the evolution of the system: (i) the oscillation frequency Ω = 2Γ/(ωα), (ii) the
damping time ∆td = 1/(2Jωα) and (iii) the average time interval between two quantum
jumps ∆tj = 2h/Γ. The ratios between these quantities determine which process is
dominating the physics of the system. Considering again the weak measurement regime
(Γ (cid:28) J) but taking into account the terms depending on Γ in equations (22-25), we ﬁnd
that both b(t) and z0(t) oscillate around the stationary point with decreasing radius.
In this limit, one has Ω∆td ≈ Jω2/Γ (cid:29) 1, indicating that the system behaves like an
under-damped oscillator (Figure 6). Importantly, there are many photocounts during
each oscillation (Ω∆tj ≈ Γh/(Jω3) (cid:28) 1) and the quantum jumps can counteract the
damping, driving the atomic system towards states with high population imbalance. In
order to prove this, we describe the average eﬀect of a quantum jump on the width of
the atomic distribution and the relative imbalance as

δb2 = ∆b2 pjump

(47)
where ∆b2 and ∆z0 are the eﬀect of a single jump on b2 and z0 computed using (42) and
(44). From these expressions we ﬁnd that the average photocurrent aﬀects b2 and z0 as

δz0 = ∆z0 pjump

Figure 6. Under-damped oscillations of (b2, ˙b2) (a) and (z0, ˙z0) (b) in a single quantum
trajectory in the weak measurement regime (Γ = 0.001J) without quantum jumps. The
black point represents the initial state (b2 = 2h, z0 = 0) while the red one marks the
stationary point.

Note that these equations are consistent with the case J = 0: the measurement process
decreases the width of the atomic distribution and, once b2 reaches its stationary value
(b2 = 0), the unbalance between odd and even sites becomes a constant. We compare
the exponential damping towards the stable point to the eﬀect of the jumps described
by (48) and (49). Speciﬁcally, solving these equations at ﬁrst order in b2 we ﬁnd

increase the amplitude of the oscillations driving the system away from the stable point
(Figure 7).

In order to estimate the behavior of the imbalance in the large time limit taking
into account both the eﬀective dynamics and the quantum jumps, we compute analogous
equations to (48) and (49) for the phases φ and c, and we incorporate them in the system
(22-25). Expanding the resulting expressions at ﬁrst order in h we ﬁnd

i. e. the population oscillates between the spatial modes without decaying (Figure 7).
If the measurement dominates the dynamics, i. e. Γ (cid:29) J, the non-Hermitian
dynamics dominates the evolution between two quantum jumps, In this case, the

coordinates of the stationary point in this regime are b2(∞) = 4h(cid:112)J/Γ and z0(∞) =

−1 + Jω2/(2Γ), i. e. the width of the atomic distribution is extremely squeezed while
the odd sites of the lattice tend to be empty. Importantly, the evolution of the system is
not oscillatory since the equations of motions around the stable point resemble an over-

stable point and the damping time are approximately the same (Ω∆td ≈ 1 + Jω2/(2Γ),
see Figure 8). As we described in the previous paragraphs, the quantum jumps decrease
the width of the atomic distribution even further and the full dynamics of b(t) is not
qualitatively diﬀerent from the one determined by the diﬀerential equation (22).
In
contrast, the evolution of the imbalance z0(t) is heavily aﬀected by the photodetections,
as illustrated in Figure 9. Speciﬁcally, we compare the dynamics due to the quantum
jumps (51) to the one due to the diﬀerential equation (24):

5. Stochastic diﬀerential equations and measurement

The mean ﬁeld description we presented in the previous paragraphs relies on the
separation between the non-Hermitian dynamics and the stochastic process described by
the quantum jumps. In this Section, we present an alternative formulation which allows
to treat these two eﬀects in the same equation. The conditional evolution of a quantum
system under continuous monitoring can be modeled by the stochastic Schrödinger
equation (SSE) [54]

that obeys the Itô table

dN (t)2 = dN (t)

(61)
(62)
This SSE describes the atomic dynamics in a single experimental run, i. e. a single
quantum trajectory. The stochastic term deﬁnes a point process which models the

if dN (t) = 1 a photon is detected and the quantum jump operator
photocounts:
is applied to wavefunction while if dN (t) = 0 the system evolves deterministically.
Importantly, the probability of detecting a photon in the (small) time interval δt depends
on the quantum state of the system and it is given by

The system (65-68) is not closed since each equation depends on the expectation values
of higher moments of ˆNo and ˆ∆. In order to give an approximate solution, we assume
that (cid:104) ˆNo(cid:105) and (cid:104) ˆ∆(cid:105) are classical Gaussian variables so that all their moments can be
o(cid:105) ≈ (cid:104) ˆNo(cid:105)3+3(cid:104) ˆNo(cid:105)σ2
expressed as a function of their mean and variance (for example (cid:104) ˆN 3
N.
Moreover, we focus on the limit of large particle number N (cid:29) 1, so that σ2
N /(cid:104) ˆNo(cid:105)2 ∼
1/N ∼ 0. Within these approximations, we can rewrite (65- 68) as

diﬀerential equations that we derived helps us to gain insight in the dynamics of the
system conditioned to the measuring process. In order to describe the evolution of a
“typical” trajectory, we focus on the equations for (cid:104) ˆNo(cid:105) and (cid:104) ˆ∆(cid:105) and we rewrite the Itô

Neglecting the ﬂuctuations in the photocounts, the equations for (cid:104) ˆNo(cid:105) and (cid:104) ˆ∆(cid:105) describe
the evolution of an harmonic oscillator and conﬁrm the emergence of the oscillatory
behavior for the population of the odd sites of the lattice. Note that these oscillations
are present even without measurement but here their behavior is fundamentally diﬀerent:
in absence of continuous monitoring the amplitude of the oscillations is proportional to
the atom imbalance of the initial state and its probability distribution tends to spread.
In contrast, here we observe that the uncertainty in the occupation of the spatial modes
(σ2
N) decreases in time (as suggested by equation (78)) and that full-exchange of atoms
between the two spatial modes is possible even starting with a perfectly balanced state.
We conﬁrm these eﬀects by rewriting (76)-(80) using the Stratonovich formalism so that

Therefore, the measurement introduces as a quasi-periodic stochastic force F that drives
the system towards larger imbalance, increasing the amplitude of the oscillations of (cid:104) ˆNo(cid:105).

6. Conclusions

We have shown that light scattering from ultracold gases in optical lattice can be
used for partitioning the system into macroscopically occupied spatial modes with
non-trivial overlap which preserve long-range coherence. We formulated an eﬀective
model for the dynamics of this mode in a single quantum trajectory, mapping each
spatial mode to a single “well” and describing its properties in term of collective
variables. The measurement backaction competes with the standard local dynamics
and induces oscillatory dynamics on the atomic state. Depending on the spatial
proﬁle of the measurement operator, this competition can be exploited for creating
multimode macroscopic superposition states which could have applications in metrology
and quantum information. We presented an analytic model that captures the emergence
of large-scale collective oscillations with increasing amplitude for the case where only
two spatial modes are present. The measurement backaction drives the system away
from its stationary point and behaves as a quasi-periodic force acting on the atoms.
Furthermore, we conﬁrmed our ﬁnding studying the stochastic equations that describe
the evolution of the atomic observables. If the ﬂuctuations in the photocount can be
neglected, the atomic population of one of the modes evolve as an harmonic oscillator.
The measurement scheme described in this work has been recently realized [19, 20]
Several
and the phenomena that we predicted can be observed in these setups.
experiments succeeded in implementing part of our proposal:
light scattered from
ultracold atoms in an optical lattice (without a cavity) has been detected [67, 68] and
ultracold bosons have been trapped in an optical cavity (without an optical lattice)
[69, 70, 71]. Moreover, the eﬀect of measurement backaction on atomic system has been
observed in the context of single-atom [72] and multi-particle quantum Zeno eﬀect [73].
Because it relies on oﬀ-resonant scattering, the monitoring scheme we propose is not
sensitive to the detailed level structure of the system. This makes it applicable to a vast
range of quantum objects such as molecules (including biological ones) [74], ions [75],
atoms in multiple cavities [76], semiconductor [77] or superconducting [78] qubits.
