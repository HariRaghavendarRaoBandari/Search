The charged lepton ﬂavor violating (CLFV) processes of µ−e− → e−e− decay by four Fermi
contact interactions in a muonic atom for various atoms are investigated. The wave functions of
bound and scattering state leptons are properly treated by solving Dirac equations with Coulomb
interaction of the ﬁnite nuclear charge distributions. This new eﬀect contributes signiﬁcantly in
particular for heavier atoms, where the obtained decay rate is about one order of magnitude larger
than the previous estimation for 208Pb. We ﬁnd that, as the atomic number Z increases, the µ−e− →
e−e− decay rates increase more rapidly than the result of the previous work of Z 3, suggesting this
decay as one of the promising processes to search for CLFV interaction.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The charged lepton ﬂavor violating (CLFV) processes are known to provide important signals on physics beyond the
Standard Model (SM). The analysis of search for µ+ → e+γ decays in the cosmic-ray muons by Hincks and Pontecorvo
in 1947 [1] has given the ﬁrst upper limit on the branching ratio of CLFV processes. Since then, the upper limits of
the branching ratios of CLFV processes have been improved and now reach around the orders of 10−12 ∼ 10−13 [2, 3].
These upper limits put stringent constraints on various theoretical models beyond the SM. These CLFV searches
include the processes such as µ+ → e+γ, µ+ → e+e−e+ and µ−N → e−N conversion in a muonic atom. Recently,
another process of µ−e− → e−e− decay in a muonic atom has been proposed by Koike et al. in 2010 [4]. A unique
feature of this process is that both photonic and contact leptonic interaction can be proved, and an experimentally
clean signal is expected because the sum of the energies of two electrons is restricted to the muon mass minus the
binding energy of the muon in a muonic atom. The measurement of this process is planned in the COMET Phase-I
experiment in J-PARC [5].

In Ref. [4], the decay rate of muonic atom was evaluated by using the non-relativistic bound state wave functions
of muon and electron and the plane wave approximation of the ﬁnal electrons. It was shown the decay rate increases
with the atomic number Z as Γ ∼ Z 3. Therefore heavy muonic atoms would provide a great opportunity of CLFV
search. However, as is well known, the eﬀects of the Coulomb interaction is signiﬁcant for the ordinary decay of bound
muons in heavy nuclei [6, 7]. Since the quantitative evaluation of the decay process is needed in order to disentangle
the mechanism of CLFV interaction, it is important to update the estimations of Ref. [4] by taking into account the
eﬀects of the Coulomb interactions for the relativistic leptons. The importance of the Coulomb distortion for the
µ− − e− conversion process in a muonic atom has been reported in Refs. [8–10]. For µ−− e− conversion process where
the nucleus stays intact, it is suﬃcient to consider the s-wave muon and electron states. For µ−e− → e−e− decay of
muonic atom, on the other hand, two electrons with the energy of approximately a half of muon mass are emitted
in the ﬁnal state. The angular momentum of the each electrons is not limited in this process. A formalism of the
µ−e− → e−e− decay with the partial wave expansion of leptons is necessary, as has been common in the nuclear beta
decay and muon capture reactions [12].

In Section II, we summarize the relevant eﬀective Lagrangian for the µ−e− → e−e− process and develop a formula
of the decay rate using the partial wave expansion of the lepton wave function. Our reﬁned estimations of the
µ−e− → e−e− decay rate for the muonic atom is presented in Section III. Finally our conclusion is given in Section
IV.

coupling constants. The left and right handed ﬁelds ψL/R are given as ψL/R = PL/Rψ with PL/R = (1 ∓ γ5)/2. The
eﬀective Lagrangian consists of two parts. The ﬁrst part, Lphoto, represents the photonic interaction of µ → eγ types,
which generates the long range µ − e interaction with one photon exchange between a muon and an electron. The
second part, Lcontact, is the four Fermi interaction. In this work, we concentrate on the contact interaction as our
ﬁrst attempt to examine the role of Coulomb interaction on the µ−e− → e−e− decay of muonic atoms.
We evaluate the decay rate of two-electron emission of the muonic atom within the independent particle picture of
the muonic atom and the ﬁnal state. The transition amplitude is given by the matrix element of the eﬀective CLFV
interaction in Eq. (3)

We assume that the muon bound state is in the n = 1, κ = −1 state denoted simply by αµ = 1S. Since orbit of the
bound muon is about 200 times smaller than that of electron, the n = 1, κ = −1 electron bound state gives the main
contribution to the decay rate of the muonic atom as long as we consider the contact interaction in Eq. (3). The

to ﬁnd the role of the Coulomb interaction on the lepton wave function. Here we take the most important transition
matrix element of 1S electron and muon to the κ = −1 electrons (µ−(1S) + e−(1S) → e−(κ = −1) + e−(κ = −1) ),
where the two electrons are equally sharing the energy Ep1 = Ep2 = (mµ + me − B1S
e )/2. We examine four
models for the lepton wave functions shown in Table I. In the model I, the bound state wave functions of muon and
electron are calculated in the non-relativistic approximation with Coulomb interaction of point nuclear charge and
the electron scattering states are in the plane wave approximation. Then the wave function of the scattering state
are replaced by the solution of Dirac equation in the model II. In the model III, both of the bound state and the
scattering state lepton wave functions are calculated from the Dirac equation with point nuclear charge. Finally, we
used the uniform nuclear charge distribution in the model IV.

µ − B1S

The transition densities of the four models for the µ−e− → e−e− decay of 208Pb muonic atom are shown in FIG.
1. The dashed curve shows transition density in the model I which simulates the previous analysis. By including the
Coulomb attraction for scattering electrons in the model II, the transition density is enhanced around the muon Bohr
radius as shown by the dash-doted curve. Further we use the consistent lepton wave functions of the Dirac equation
with point nuclear charge in the model III. The transition density becomes very large as shown by the dash-two-dotted
curve, which is 1/3 of the actual transition density. However, the use of point nuclear charge would not be appropriate
for atom of large Z, where the Bohr radius of muon can be comparable to the nuclear radius. The solid curve shows
our ﬁnal result by using ﬁnite charge distribution of nucleus in the model IV. The peak position of the transition
density is shifted toward larger r compared with that of point nuclear charge. Here the charge distribution of nucleus
is taken as uniform distribution as

ρC (r) =

3Ze
4πR3 θ(R − r).

(32)

We use R = 1.2A1/3 for mass number A. For each Z, we take the mass number A of the most abundant isotope [14],
e.g. A = 208 for Z = 82.

that the decay rate is proportional to (Z − 1)3. The formula was obtained by using the non-relativistic bound state
of the muon and 1S electron with a point nuclear charge and the plane wave approximation for the ﬁnal electrons.
The decay rate Γ obtained in this work is shown in FIG. 2. Here the ratios Γ/Γ0 are plotted. We retain only the

been multiplied to the dash-two-dotted curve.

curve in Fig 2 shows the decay rate evaluated with model I. The ratio for model I deviates from the unity for large Z
because of using ﬁnite size bound muon wave function instead of using plane wave in the previous estimation. When
we replace the plane wave electrons with the Dirac wave function for point nuclear charge(II), the decay rate increases
as shown in the dash-dotted curve. When both bound and scattering states are described by the Dirac equation that
includes the Coulomb interaction of point nuclear charge(III), the decay rate is even more enhanced as shown in the
dash-two-dotted curve. A realistic description of Γ/Γ0 is obtained by using the uniform nuclear charge distribution
in model IV as shown in the solid curve in Fig. 2.

The results show that, while Γ0 gives reasonable estimation for smaller Z ∼ 20, the Z dependence of the Γ is
stronger than (Z − 1)3. The ratio Γ/Γ0 is about 7.0 for the 208Pb. We found slightly diﬀerent Z dependence of Γ
for two types of the eﬀective CLFV contact interaction. The interaction of gi term with i = 1, 2, 3, 4, which leads
to the same helicity states of two electrons gives Γ/Γ0 ∼ 7.0(1.1) for 208Pb (40Ca). For gi term with i = 5, 6, where
the opposite helicity states of electrons are emitted, the decay rate is Γ/Γ0 ∼ 6.3(1.1) for 208Pb (40Ca). Therefore Z
dependence of the decay rate for g1 ∼ g4 is slightly stronger than that of g5 and g6.
All the results of the decay rate were obtained by including suﬃciently large number of partial waves of ﬁnal
electrons. The convergence properties of the decay rate against the number of partial waves included is shown in
Table II. The number of partial waves needed to obtain convergent results was |κ| ∼ 6 for Pb and Sn and |κ| ∼ 13 for
Ca. This happens because the muon Bohr radius is increasing for decreasing Z.

The results shown so far were obtained including only the main transitions where the initial electrons are bound in
the 1S state. The contributions of the electrons from the higher shell 2S, 3S... are estimated within the independent
particle model for the atomic electrons. Contributions of higher shell electrons increase the transition rate by ∼ 20%
as shown in Table III, which is consistent with the result of the previous work.
The energy and angular distribution of electron calculated from the double diﬀerential decay rate in Eq. (9) for the
208Pb is shown in FIG. 3. The two ﬁnal electrons are mainly emitted with the same energy in a opposite direction, since
the momentum carried by the bound two leptons is minimized in this conﬁguration. The electron energy spectrum

normalized by decay rate dΓ/dE/Γ and the angular distribution between the two electrons are shown in FIG. 4 and
in FIG. 5 for the models IV(solid) and I(dash). The maximum of the energy distribution is around half of the total
energy mµ + me − B1S
e . Most of the ﬁnal electrons are emitted in the opposite directions. The shapes of the
energy distribution and the angular distribution are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the models I and IV. The angular and
the energy distributions in model IV becomes narrower than those of model I. This is because the muon is less bound
for ﬁnite range nuclear charge distribution, and therefore it has smaller high momentum component.

µ − B1S

For the interaction which leads to the same chirality of ﬁnal electrons, i.e. g1 ∼ g4 terms of Eq. (4), the Pauli
principle prevents the ﬁnal electron from having the same momentum. On the other hand, in g5 and g6 terms which
leads to electrons with opposite chiralities, this does not apply. A diﬀerence between two interaction terms appears
near cos θ = 1 as seen in FIG. 6.

Finally, we evaluate upper limits for the branching ratio of the µ−e− → e−e− decay of a muonic atom. The
branching ratio of µ−e− → e−e− is deﬁned by using the µ−e− → e−e− decay rate of muonic atom Γ(µ−e− → e−e−)
(Γ given in Eq. (6)) and the total decay rate of muonic atom 1/˜τµ:

Br(µ−e− → e−e−) ≡ ˜τµΓ(µ−e− → e−e−).

(35)

We estimate the strength of the CLFV interaction from the current upper limit of the branching ratio of µ+ → e+e+e−.
The branching ratio Br(µ+ → e+e+e−) is given as

Br(µ+ → e+e+e−) ≡τµΓ(µ+ → e+e+e−).

(36)

Here Γ(µ+ → e+e+e−) and 1/τµ are the decay rate of µ+ → e+e+e− and total decay rate of free muon, respectively.

The upper limits of branching ratio of the previous work(dashed curve) and our results with 1S(solid curve)

the branching ratios Br(µ−e− → e−e−) considering only 1S electrons and all electrons are 3.3 × 10−18 (6.9 × 10−18)
and 4.2 × 10−18 (9.8 × 10−18), respectively. Br(µ−e− → e−e−) reaches about 10−17 for 238U.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have made an improved study on the µ−e− → e−e− decay in muonic atoms. Coulomb interaction of leptons
with ﬁnite nuclear charge distributions is taken into account by using the standard multipole expansion formalism and
the numerical solutions of Dirac equations for both the electron and muon wave functions. The eﬀects of Coulomb
distortion of the emitted electron and relativistic treatments of the bound leptons are signiﬁcantly important for
quantitative estimations of the decay rate. Enhancements of the decay rates of about 9 and 14 times for 208Pb and
238U respectively compared with the previous analysis are obtained due to the enhanced overlap integrals of the lepton
wave functions. We also found that diﬀerent helicity structures of the CLFV interaction generate sizable diﬀerence
in the Z-dependence of the decay rate and also the angular distribution of the emitted electrons. Finally, the upper
limits of the branching ratio of the µ−e− → e−e− decay of muonic atom was estimated.
In this work we have included only the four Fermi CLFV interaction. It is important to estimate the photonic
interaction which generates long range interactions between the bound muon and many electrons in an atom.
In
addition to the decay rates, it would be of great interest to ﬁnd some other observables that may be useful to
discriminate photonic and contact interactions and also various terms of the eﬀective CLFV interactions. These
issues are under progress and will be discussed in a separate paper.
