LIFTED TRACE DEFECT FORMULAE ON COVERINGS

SARA AZZALI AND SYLVIE PAYCHA

Abstract. The canonical trace and the Wodzicki residue on classical pseudodif-
ferential operators on a closed manifold are shown to be preserved under lifting
to the universal covering as a result of their local feature. In contrast, regularised
traces, such as ζ-regularised traces, are shown to diﬀer from their lifted counter-
part by an ordinary trace of an operator with smooth kernel. The latter vanishes
for regularised traces of diﬀerential operators; the Z2-graded generalisation of this
statement yields back Atiyah’s L2-index theorem. In contrast, the eta invariant
of an essentially self-adjoint invertible diﬀerential operator diﬀers from the L2-eta
invariant of its lift by an ordinary trace of some operator with smooth kernel. More
generally, we prove that due to their local feature, defect formula that express dis-
crepancies of regularised traces for integer order classical pseudodiﬀerential on
closed manifolds, lift to their universal covering.

Introduction

A diﬀerential operator A on a closed manifold M lifts to a diﬀerential operator eA on its
universal covering eM → M. This is due to the locality property of a diﬀerential operator

which preserves the support of the sections it is acting on. This lifting property does not
extend to a general pseudodiﬀerential operator which is only pseudo-local i.e., which only
preserves the singular support of the sections.
However, following Shubin [Sh01], one can impose the additional requirement that the
pseudodiﬀerential operator has ﬁnite propagation in requiring that it is ε-local for some
small enough ε > 0. Such operators, which fall into the more general class of quasi-local
operators1 introduced by Roe [Ro88], are properly supported and hence determined by
their symbol. An ε-local pseudodiﬀerential operator modiﬁes the support of the sections
it is acting on, by at most the distance ε. The fact that a diﬀerential operator preserves the
supports is therefore conﬁrmed by the fact that it is 0-local.
Choosing ε small enough, one can lift without ambiguity an ε-local operator A0 to an

ε-local operator eA0. The lifted operator is a (uniformly) properly supported pseudodiﬀer-
ential operator, and hence also deﬁned in terms of its symbol σ(eA0), which is the lifted
symbol σ(eA0) = σ(A0)∼ of the original operator.

To go from ε-local to a general classical pseudodiﬀerential operator A on a closed mani-
fold, we observe that the latter diﬀers from a ε-local classical pseudodiﬀerential operator
A0 by an operator S with smooth kernel supported outside the diagonal (see Proposition
1.27), so it lies in the class

[A0]diag :=(cid:8)A0 + S , S with a smooth kernel supported outside the diagonal(cid:9) .

1Quasi-local operators can roughly be viewed as operators with controlled propagation at inﬁnity, see
[En15] for a detailed discussion. They bare the advantage over ﬁnite propagation operators, that they are
stable under functional calculus, a property which is not needed here.

The lifted operator eA0 belongs to the class
[A0]diag∼ :=neA0 + S , S acting on eM, with smooth kernel supported outside the diagonalo .
Clearly, σ(A) ∼ σ(A0) and σ(A)∼ ∼ σ(eA0) for any A in [A0]diag.

Local linear forms, which only detect the symbol of an operator, are constant on equiva-
lence classes [A0]diag. We call a linear form Λ deﬁned on a class of classical pseudodiﬀer-
ential operators local (see Deﬁnition 2.3) if it is of the form

Λ(A) =ZM

Λx(A) dx :=ZM

λ (tr (σ(A)(x, ·))) dx,

(1)

λ being a linear form on an appropriate class of scalar valued symbols, tr the ﬁbrewise
trace on the endomorphism bundle in which the symbol σ(A)(·, ξ) of A lies for any ξ
in the cotangent bundle to the underlying manifold. We show (see Theorem 2.4) that
any continuous2 local linear form on the class of classical pseudodiﬀerential operators
with integer order (resp. on the class of classical pseudodiﬀerential operators non-integer
order) is proportional to the Wodzicki residue Res (see (42)) (resp. the canonical trace TR
(see (43)))

Res(A) =ZM

 resp. TR(A) =ZM

acting respectively on the algebra of classical pseudodiﬀerential operators with integer
order and on the class of classical pseudodiﬀerential operators with non-integer order.
The densities Resx(A) dx (resp. TRx(A) dx) are deﬁned by means of the residue res (resp.

the canonical integral −RRn) on integer order (resp. on non-integer order) scalar symbols.
A local linear form (1) can be lifted from a ε-local operator A0 on M to its lift eA0 on
eM by ΛΓ(eA0) =RF λ(cid:16)tr(cid:16)σ(eA0)(x, ·)(cid:17)(cid:17) dx, where F is a fundamental domain for the action
indeed A lies in the class [eA0]diag of some lifted ε-local operatorfA0. ΛΓ bing constant on

of the fundamental group. It further lifts to any Γ-invariant operator A on the covering;

such a class, we set

Whereas the canonical trace lifts to coverings due to its local feature, the regularised

operators on M, deﬁned as the Hadamard ﬁnite part

(here Resz=p stands for the complex residue at p) is generally non local and does not a pri-
ori lift to coverings. However, defect formulae, which express the discrepancies of regu-
larised traces in terms of the Wodzicki residue and therefore also enjoy a local feature, do
lift to coverings (Theorem 2.11). More precisely, if A(p) has a well-deﬁned canonical trace
TR(A(p)), the trace defect formula (see Theorem 2.6, borrowed from [KV94] and [PS07]),

relates the regularised trace fpz=pTR(A(z)) with the (extended) residue Res(cid:0)log A′(p)(cid:1) of

the derivative of the family at this pole (see (46)),

fpz=pTR(A(z)) = TR(A(p)) +

Res(cid:0)A′(p)(cid:1) ,
where the operators A(z) have order a − qz for some given positive q.
If A(p) is a diﬀerential operator, then TR(A(p)) = 0 and (3) reduces to a local expression of
the regularised trace fpz=pTR(A(z)) = 1

for a holomorphic family A(z) of Γ-invariant operators on the covering, such that A(p)
at the point p has a well-deﬁned Γ-canonical trace TRΓ(A(p)). Corollary 2.12, which is
useful for applications, then says that if A(z) is a holomorphic family on the covering
such that for some holomorphic family A(z) of ε-local operators on M, the diﬀerence

A(p) − gA(p) at a point p has a smooth kernel, then the map z 7→ TRΓ (A(z)) − TRΓ(cid:16)gA(z)(cid:17)

is holomorphic at point p and

fpz=pTRΓ (A(z)) − fpz=pTR (A(z)) = TrΓ(A(p) − gA(p)).

We apply (5) to the holomorphic families A(z) = P(D) h(∆) Qε(∆)−z on M and

∆ := D2 a Laplace-type operator, Qε(∆) deﬁned in (28) for some ε > 0 is a smooth
deformation of ∆, P is a polynomial, and h some measurable function on a contour around
the spectrum of Qε(∆). This yields Theorem 2.13, which compares the corresponding

A(z) = P(eD) h(cid:16)Qε(e∆)(cid:17) Qε(e∆)−z on eM. Here D is a Dirac-type operator, and consequently
Qε(∆)-regularised trace of P(D) h (∆) and the Qε(e∆)-regularised trace of P(eD) h(cid:16)Qε(e∆)(cid:17).
• In the Z2-graded case and for P ≡ 1, h ≡ 1 this gives back Atiyah’s L2-index
theorem ind(D) = ind(eD) where eD is the lift of the Dirac operator D.
• In the non-graded case and for P(x) = x, h(x) = x− 1
2 , assuming both operators D
and its lift eD to be invertible, the above constructions show that the eta-invariant
of the lifted Dirac operator diﬀers from the eta-invariant of the Dirac operator D
on the base manifold by an ordinary Γ-trace TrΓ(eA0 − A) of the diﬀerence of two
Γ-invariant operators, one of whicheA0, is the lift of an ε-local operator A0 ∈ [A]diag

The above arguments make use of functions of pseudodiﬀerential operators, in partic-
ular their complex power and the related logarithm. Even though the constructions are
similar to the ones for operators on closed manifolds, special care is to be taken in the
open manifold case. In Section 1.2, we ﬁrst review various classes of pseudodiﬀerential
operators on open manifolds, soon specialising to coverings. The essential diﬀerence be-
tween the various classes lies in the smoothing part, to which we therefore dedicate the
ﬁrst section –Section 1.1– of the paper. We then relate pseudodiﬀerential operators on
coverings to pseudodiﬀerential operators on the associated groupoid C and the associated
Hilbert module bundle (see Appendix B), thereby relating constructions of complex pow-
ers and logarithms on groupoids and Hilbert module bundles with the ones on coverings
presented here.

1. Γ-invariant operators on coverings and functional calculus

1.1. Operators with smooth kernels. Let X be a n-dimensional manifold and F → X a
vector bundle over X of rank k. To a linear operator A : C∞c (X, F) → C∞(X, F) we assign
its Schwartz kernel denoted by KA, which is a distributional section of the bundle F ⊠ F
over M × M. The support of A is the smallest subset of X × X on the complement of which
KA vanishes as a distribution.
Deﬁnition 1.1. Let Ψ−∞(X, F) be the space of linear operators with smooth kernel.

Sobolev spaces will be useful to introduce another class of operators; in order to have
Sobolev spaces at hand, we henceforth assume that our manifold X has bounded geometry
[Sh92, MS89, Ko87], a property veriﬁed by covering spaces of interest to us.

1.1.1. Smoothing operators on manifolds of bounded geometry.

Deﬁnition 1.2. A Riemannian manifold (X, g) is said to have bounded geometry if

• it has positive injectivity radius (there is r > 0 s.t. the exponential map is a diﬀeo-
• every covariant derivative of the Riemannian curvature tensor is bounded.

morphism on B(0, r) ⊂ TxX, ∀x ∈ X);

In the same way, a Hermitian vector bundle F → X has bounded geometry if every co-
variant derivative of the curvature is bounded.

Example 1.3. Lie groups or homogeneous spaces with invariant metrics, compact Rie-
mannian manifolds, regular Γ-covering of compact Riemannian manifolds endowed with
the induced Riemannian structure, all provide examples of manifolds of bounded geome-
try.

We now assume the bundle F → X to be of bounded geometry. The fundamental prop-
erty is the existence of a “good” partition of unity, which allows to deﬁne Sobolev spaces
Hs(X, F), see for instance [Sh92, Lemmas 1.3, 3.22, and (1.3)] and [Sc96, Deﬁnition
3.23].

Remark 1.4. The Banach space structure of Hs(X, F) is independent of the choices in
the deﬁnition (see [Sh92, Lemma 3.24]). Just as in the case of closed manifolds, Sobolev
spaces can alternatively be deﬁned by means of a (uniformly) elliptic operator, see [Sc96,
Lemma 4.29 and Corollary 4.30] for the comparison with this deﬁnition.

Let H∞(X, E) = ∩k∈NHk(X, E) denote the projective limit of Hk(E), k ∈ N and let
(X, E) ⊃ ∪k∈NH−k(X, E) denote the regular inductive limit of H−k(E), k ∈ N. Then

where L(A, B) stands for continuous linear operators from a topological space A to a topo-
logical space B. The notation we chose is inspired by Shubin, who calls these operators
S-smoothing [Sh, Def. 1, Ch. 3].

3A. Engel makes an additional similar assumption on the adjoint operator.

SARA AZZALI AND SYLVIE PAYCHA

By Theorem 3.5 in [Va08], an operator which smoothens sections has a smooth kernel,

which leads to the following inclusion

Following [Sh89] and [Ro88], we set the following deﬁnition.

SΨ−∞(X, F) ⊆ Ψ−∞(X, F).

(7)

Deﬁnition 1.5. Let UΨ−∞(X, F) denote the space of linear operators A : C∞c(X, F) →
C∞(X, F) with smooth kernel KA satisfying the following uniform boundedness condition:
for any multiindices α, β

x ∂β
k∂α

yKA(x, y)k ≤ Cα,β ∀(x, y) ∈ X × X

for some positive constant Cα,β.

Proposition 2.9 in [Ro88] yields a reﬁnement of (7), namely

SΨ−∞(X, F) ⊆ UΨ−∞(X, F).

(8)

The uniformity follows from uniform estimates that naturally arise in the context of bounded
geometry as they do for closed manifolds.

Remark 1.6. If X is a closed manifold, the three above spaces coincide:

SΨ−∞(X, F) = UΨ−∞(X, F) = Ψ−∞(X, F).

The notion of properly supported operators recalled in Deﬁnition A.5, extends in a
straightforward manner to linear operators A : C∞c (X, F) → C∞(X, F). The following
deﬁnition inspired from [Sh92], and follows the terminology of [En15].
Deﬁnition 1.7. An operator A : C∞c (X, F) → C∞(X, F) with Schwartz kernel KA has ﬁnite
propagation4 than the quasi-locality of Roe [Ro88] if it is C-local (see Deﬁnition A.10)
for some positive C, i.e. if there is some C > 0 such that KA(x, y) = 0 ∀x, y with |x−y| > C
or equivalently, if

∀u ∈ C∞c (U, Ck);

supp(Au) ⊂ {x : d(x, supp u) ≤ C}.

Let UΨ−∞fp (X, F) denote the subspace of UΨ−∞(X, F) consisting of ﬁnite propagation

operators with uniformly bounded smooth kernels. We have [Sh89]

UΨ−∞fp (X, F) ( SΨ−∞(X, F) ⊆ UΨ−∞(X, F) ⊆ Ψ−∞(X, F).

(9)
Remark 1.8. The class UΨ−∞fp (X, F) is strictly contained in SΨ−∞(X, F) for the heat op-
erator e−tD2 on a bounded geometry manifold, belongs to the class SΨ−∞(X, F) (see for
example [Va08, §3.2]) but it does not have ﬁnite propagation.
Remark 1.9. Neither classe Ψm(X, F) nor Ψcl(X, F) form an algebra. Indeed, the com-
position of two operators with smooth kernels is deﬁned only under appropriate decay
conditions at inﬁnity and when this is the case, the Schwartz kernel of the composition
might not be smooth.

Example 1.10. Rn is a universal cover of Tn with group Γ = π1(Tn) = Zn.

specialise to covering manifolds. Let M be a (connected) closed manifold and eM a reg-
ular covering given by a Γ-principal bundle π : eM → M with Γ = Aut(p) the discrete
Let eM be the universal cover so that Γ = π1(M) is the fundamental group of M.
If M is a Riemannian manifold, we endow the covering eM with the Riemannian struc-
ture induced by π. Let E → M be a Hermitian vector bundle and eE := π∗E → eM its
pullback. Both eM and eE are of bounded geometry [Sh92].
The action of Γ on eM via diﬀeomorphisms Lγ

Deﬁnition 1.11. Let Ψ−∞Γ (eM,eE), resp. UΨ−∞Γ (eM,eE), resp. UΨ−∞fp,Γ(eM,eE), resp. SΨ−∞Γ (eM,eE)
denote the space of Γ-invariant operators in Ψ−∞( ˜M, ˜E), resp. UΨ−∞(eM,eE), UΨ−∞fp (eM,eE),
SΨ−∞(X, F).

1.2. Classes of pseudodiﬀerential operators. In this section we discuss diﬀerent classes
of pseudodiﬀerential operators on an open manifold of bounded geometry (we also con-
sider very general classes, which possibly do not form algebras). This short review which
brings together and compares diﬀerent approaches, follows [Sh92, MS89, Ko87, Ro88,
En15].

(11)

1.2.1. Classical pseudodiﬀerential operators on manifolds with bounded geometry. Let
X be a n-dimensional manifold and F → X a vector bundle over X of rank k. We assume
X and F are both of bounded geometry.
Deﬁnition-Lemma 1.12. The following relations

• A ∼ B ⇐⇒ A − B has a smooth kernel
• A ∼diag B ⇐⇒ A − B has a smooth kernel supported outside the diagonal

deﬁne equivalence relations on the space L(cid:0)C∞c (X, F), C∞(X, F)(cid:1) of linear operators acting
on the space C∞c (X, F) of compactly supported sections of F with values in the space
C∞(X, F) of smooth sections of F. We write [A] (resp. [A]diag) for the equivalence class
of A with respect to ∼ (resp. ∼diag).
5These are smooth diﬀeomorphisms φ : eM → eM such that π ◦ f = π.

8

SARA AZZALI AND SYLVIE PAYCHA

Remark 1.13.

• Clearly, we have A ∼diag B =⇒ A ∼ B.

• Whereas the equivalence relation ∼ is stable under composition of operators (when-
ever composable), the equivalence relation ∼diag is not. Indeed, if A − A1 =: R and
B − B1 =: S have smooth kernels supported outside the diagonal, then AB =
A1S + RB1 + RS has a smooth kernel but it might not be supported outside the
diagonal since the supports of A1 and B1 intersect the diagonal.

Example 1.14. Given a linear operator A : C∞c (X, F) → C∞(X, F), any localisation χ1 Aχ2
induced by two smooth functions χ1, χ2 whose compact supports have a non void inter-
section in a trivialising set, is properly supported.

We shall make use of the the existence of a “good” partition of unity, [Sh92, Lemmas
1.3, 3.22] and [Sh92, A1.1] built as follows. For small enough ρ (smaller than a third of
the injectivity radius), there is a countable covering of X by balls B(xi, ρ) centered at xi ∈ X
with radius ρ such that d(xi, x j) ≥ ρ for i , j and any point x ∈ X lies in at most Cx number
of such balls for some constant Cx. Moreover, there is a partition of unity 1 = Pi χi with
smooth functions χi whose supports supp χi lie in B(xi, 2ρ) and which together with their
derivatives taken in normal coordinates, are bounded independently of i.
Lemma 1.15. Given a linear operator A : C∞c (X, F) → C∞(X, F) there is a properly
supported operator A0 : C∞c (X, F) → C∞c (X, F) of ﬁnite propagation such that
(12)

For any ε > 0, the operator A0 can be chosen ε-local.
Proof. Given a ”good” ﬁnite open cover U = (Ui)i∈I of X and a ”good” partition of unity
(χi)i∈I subordinated to U, we write the operator A as
χiAχ j

χiAχ j

(13)

A ∼diag A0.

χiAχ j has Schwartz kernel supported outside the diagonal.

:= χiAχ j.
where P is the set of pairs {i, j} satisfying supp χi ∩ supp χ j , ∅, and Ai j
Then, A0 := P{i, j}∈P
Ai j is a properly supported operator of ﬁnite propagation since each
χiAχ j is supported in balls with uniformly bounded radii. Moreover, by construction
S (A) :=P{i, j}∈∁P
For ε > 0, we can choose the diameter of the partition such that ∀i ∈ I, diam Ui < ε
2, in
which case A0 is a ε-local operator.
(cid:3)
Deﬁnition 1.16. Given any real (resp. complex) number m, a linear operator A : C∞c (X, F) →
C∞(X, F) is a (resp. classical) pseudodiﬀerential operator of order m if there is a prop-
erly supported operator A0 : C∞c (X, F) → C∞c (X, F) of ﬁnite propagation with A ∼diag A0
as in (12) and such that
• the operator S (A) := A − A0 lies in Ψ−∞(X, F),
• the operator A0 is a sum6 A0 =Pα Op(σα) of (classical) properly supported pseu-

dodiﬀerential operators Op(σα) of order m supported on ”good” open subsets of X
and identiﬁed via the trivailising charts with pseudodiﬀerential operators on open
subsets of Rn. The symbol σα is interpreted as the symbol σ(A) of A seen in the
trivialising chart indexed by α.

6When applying the operator to a compactly supported section, the sum becomes ﬁnite, due to the local

ﬁniteness of a ”good” open cover.

1.2.2. Uniform classical pseudodiﬀerential operators. We now specialise to the smaller
class of uniform pseudodiﬀerential operators, introduced by Shubin and Meladze on Lie
groups in [MS89] and by Kordyukov [Ko87] in the general setting of a bounded geometry
manifold (see for instance [Sh89, 3]). As we shall see later, it is an appropriate class
to host pseudodiﬀerential operators on coverings and consists of the usual H¨ormander
properly supported pseudo-diﬀerential operators with additional uniformity conditions.
Deﬁnition 1.18. Given (resp. m ∈ C) m ∈ R, let UΨm(X, F) (resp. UΨm
cl(X, F)) be
the class of all uniform (resp. classical) pseudodiﬀerential operators of order m i.e.,
operators A ∈ Ψm(X, F) (resp. A ∈ Ψcl(X, F)) which in a ”good” trivialising covering
X = ∪iB(xi, ρ) of X read A ∼diag A0 as in (12), where

• the operator S (A) := A − A0 lies in UΨ−∞(X, F)

deﬁnes the following subclasses of operators:
(16)
Remark 1.19. As can be seen from (65), for a vector bundle E → M on a closed
manifold M, (14) is veriﬁed by any pseudodiﬀerential operator so that UΨm(M, E) =
UΨm(M, E). Similarly, (15) is satisﬁed by any classical pseudodiﬀerential operator and
we have UΨm

cl(X, F) ∀m ∈ C.

cl(M, E) = UΨm

cl(X, F) ⊆ UΨm

Similarly to pseudodiﬀerential operators on closed manifolds, uniform pseudodiﬀer-
ential operators modify the degree of regularity of Sobolev spaces by the order of the
operator [Sh92, Remark (c) after Def. 3.3].
Lemma 1.20. [En15, Proposition 2.20] An operator A ∈ UΨm(X, F) extends to a bounded
operator

• The proof of [En15, Proposition 2.20], stated for quasi-local uni-
form pseudodiﬀerential operators, relies on the local ﬁniteness of the covering and
does not use quasi-locality. Hence the proof extends to elements of UΨm(X, F).

• Consequently, the space of uniform pseudodiﬀerential operators of real order m
compares with the space Opm(X, F) used in [Va08, pag. 11] to denote the space of
all “m-regularising operators”, i.e. the linear operators A : C∞c (X, F) → C∞c (X, F)′
which extend as in (17)

UΨm(X, F) ( UΨm(X, F) ( Opm(X, F) .

This leads to the following identiﬁcations.

Proposition 1.22. (compare with [En15, Lemma 2.22])

SΨ−∞(X, F) = ∩m∈RUΨm(X, F) = UΨ−∞(X, F).

cl(X, F) =

cl(X, F) for any complex number m.

Consequently, SUΨm(X, F) = UΨm(X, F) for any real number m and SUΨm
UΨm
Proof. For any real number m, on the one hand we have ∩m∈RUΨm(X, F) ⊂ SΨ−∞(X, F) as
a consequence of (17). On the other hand, we know by (8) that SΨ−∞(X, F) ⊂ UΨ−∞(X, F) ⊂
UΨm(X, F) for any real number m. Hence SUΨ−∞(X, F) ⊂ ∩m∈RUΨm(X, F) and the ﬁrst
identity follows.
As for the second identity, we have the straightforward inclusion UΨ−∞(X, F) ⊂ UΨm(X, F)
for any real number m which yields the inclusion from right to left. The inclusion from
left to right follows from observing that the uniform estimates (14) imply the uniform
boundedness of the derivatives of the Schwartz kernel of the operator.

Remark 1.24. As consequences of cocompactness of eM, a Γ-invariant operator on eM is
properly supported if and only if its Schwartz kernel has compact support in (eM × eM)/Γ,
We equip eM with a Γ-invariant locally ﬁnite open cover in the following way: given a
ﬁnite open cover UM = {U j, j = 1, · · · , N} of M, we lift it to eM and take all the connected

component to have a cover by connected open subsets. We obtain a Γ-invariant locally

of M subordinated to the covering UM is lifted to a Γ-invariant partition of unity {eχ j} j=1,··· ,N,
which is a ”good” partition of unity in the sense of manifolds with bounded geometry.
Such a partition of unity combined with a subordinated trivialisation of eE can be used
to construct Sobolev spaces Hs(eM,eE) of sections on eE [Sc96, Deﬁnition 1, §3.9]. As

lifted from M to eM, and their lifts are uniform properly supported operators. We include
the proof of this classical fact for completeness.
Lemma 1.26. [Sh, Proposition 1, §3.9] With the notation as above, let r0 := infx∈X{d(x, γx), γ ∈
Γ \ {e}} > 0, where e is the unit of Γ and let A : C∞(M, E) → C∞(M, E) be an ε-local
operator with ε < r0

(1) There exists a unique ε-local operator eA : C∞c (eM,eE) → C∞(eM,eE) such that for
any lifted local sectiones of F of a local section s of E
We write π♯(eA) = A;

To show (2), let (V, Φ) be a local trivialisation of E where V is an evenly covered open set.
Recall that the symbol of A on this local chart, denoted by σV(A)(x, ξ), is by deﬁnition the
symbol of the operator Φ♯AV acting on matrix valued functions on φ(V) ⊂ Rn, where AV
is the localization of A on V. The symbol of the lifted operator eA is described as follows.
Let π−1(V) =Fγ∈Γ Uγ; on each local chart (Uγ, φ ◦ π) the symbol is deﬁned as the symbol
of (Φ ◦ π)♯eAUγ. It follows that σUγ(eA)(x, ξ) = σV(A)(π(x), ξ).
The fact that eA lies in UΨm
cl,Γ(eM,eE)) then follows from the fact that
UΨm(M, E) = Ψm
modulo ∼diag, and have therefore a “lifted” analogue of Proposition A.7.
Proposition 1.27. Let ε > 0 and A be an operator in ΨΓ(eM,eE).

independently of the choice of eA ∈ [A]diag. If A is ε-local, in particular if it is a
diﬀerential operator, then A = gπ∗A.
Proof. Let {eχ j} j=1,··· ,N be a Γ-invariant partition of unity subordinated to a cover X =
S j=1,..,N
1.15 we write a Γ-invariant operator A ∈ ΨΓ(eM,eE) as

A =Xi, j eχiAeχ j = Xsuppeχi∩suppeχ j,∅eχiAeχ j + Xsuppeχi∩suppeχ j=∅eχiAeχ j,

where with a slight abuse of notation, using the notations of (18), we have set suppeχi =
∪γ∈Γ suppeχi,γ.

Choosing the diameter of the partition small enough and applying Proposition 1.26 to the
ε-local operators χiAχ j, we have

a linear operator with smooth kernel supported outside the diagonal.
If A is ε-local, then the above construction reduces to

1.5. Lifting functions of operators. Let E be a hermitian vector bundle over the closed
Riemannian manifold M.
We borrow the following deﬁnition from [ALNP15].
Deﬁnition 1.29. We call a weight, an operator Q ∈ Ψcl(M, E) such that

(1) Q is invertible,
(2) Q has positive order q,
(3) Q has a principal angle θ, which means that there exists a ray Rθ = {reiθ, r ≥
0} which is disjoint from the spectrum of the End(Ex)-valued leading symbol
σL(Q)(x, ξ) for any x ∈ M, ξ ∈ T ∗x M \ {0}.
This last condition implies that the spectrum of the operator Q lies outside a cone Λθ
containing the ray Rθ, [ALNP15, Lemma 1.6].
Example 1.30. Let D in Ψd
cl(M, E) be an essentially self-adjoint elliptic diﬀerential oper-
ator of positive order d. Then ∆ := D2 is a non-negative elliptic diﬀerential operator on M
of positive order q := 2d and the operator ∆ + 1 is a diﬀerential operator which deﬁnes a
weight.
Example 1.31. With the same notations as in the above example, we can instead add to ∆
a smoothing operator χ[−ε,ε](∆) with ε > 0 chosen small enough so that it coincides with
the orthogonal projection χ0(∆) onto the kernel of ∆. Then

deﬁnes a weight with spectral cut π.

Qε(∆) := ∆ + χ[−ε,ε](∆)

A weight Q ∈ Ψcl(M, E) satisﬁes a resolvent estimate, see [Sh01, (9.30)] and [Se66,

Ψ(M, E) with the same spectral cut. If σ(Q) ∼ ]σ(Q), then for every measurable function
h on a contour Γπ around the ray Rθ, such that |h(λ)| ≤ |λ|−δ for some positive δ, we have:

Proof. The star product ⋆, which is a local operation for it only involves derivatives,

commutes with the lift. For two local symbols σ and τ, we have σ ⋆ τ∼ ∼ eσ ⋆eτ, which

Then β is called an Agmon angle for A ∈ UΨcl,Γ(eM,eE) if there is some ǫ > 0 such that
spec(A) ∩ Vβ,ǫ = ∅

In particular an operator with Agmon angle is elliptic and invertible.

Deﬁnition 1.37. We call weight an operator in Ψ(eM,eE) of positive order that admits an

see also [ALNP15]), we need to check that

Qε(e∆) :=e∆ + χ[−ε,ε](e∆),
Qε(∆H) = Φ♯Qε(e∆).

(1) the operator χ[−ε,ε](e∆), resp. χ[−ε,ε](∆H) has a smooth Schwartz kernel in ΨΓ(eM,eE),

(2) the operatore∆ + χ[−ε,ε](e∆), resp. ∆H + χ[−ε,ε](∆H) is invertible, which is an imme-
diate consequence of its non-negativity.

Equation (36) then follows from the compatibility of the map Φ with functional calculus,
see (2) in Appendix C.

Vassout’s functional calculus on groupoids recalled in Appendix C, allows to extend

the notion of weight to the groupoid G(M) := (eM × eM)/Γ associated with UΨcl,Γ(eM,eE),

induced preserves the properties 1)-3) of a weight and therefore transforms a weight Q ∈
UΨcl,Γ(eM,eE) with spectral cut θ to a weight ρ♯(Q) on the associated groupoid with the
same spectral cut. The map ρ♯ preserves the estimate (29) on weights, which enables
us to transport the related functional calculus from the groupoid to UΨcl,Γ(eM,eE). With

with Schwartz kernel R(z, x, y) ∈ C∞(W × M × M, E ⊠ E) holomorphic in z.

There are at least two types of approaches to show that complex powers deﬁne holo-
morphic families. One by Seeley (see also Shubin)7 [Sh01, Thm. 11.2] using in a central
manner the calculus of the symbol of the resolvent of the operator, and a cohomologi-
cal construction by Guillemin8 [Gu85, Thm 5.2] axiomatic in nature and therefore easily
transposable to more general contexts.

These constructions, which rely on basic properties of classical pseudodiﬀerential op-

erators, namely

(1) an estimate of the type (29) on the resolvent of a weight, leading to the existence

of Cauchy integrals for weights,

that “commutes” with Cauchy integrals,

(2) the existence of a map Op : σ 7→ Op(σ) taking symbols to operators in the algebra,
extend to very general algebras of classical pseudodiﬀerential operators, including clas-
sical pseudodiﬀerential operators on groupoids and uniform classical pseudodiﬀerential
operators on coverings.

7Seeley and Shubin consider complex powers of diﬀerential elliptic operators but their construction can

be extended to classical pseudodiﬀerential operators using the symbol of the resolvent of these operators.

When A is trace-class, namely when the order of A has real part smaller than −n, then
Res(A) = 0 and TR (A) = Tr (A), where Tr stands for the ordinary trace of A. Further-
more, we have

A ∼ B =⇒ Res (A) = Res (B)
Res(A) = Res(A0) = Res([A])

and
and

A ∼diag B =⇒ TR (A) = TR (B)
TR(A) = TR(A0) = TR([A]diag).

Proof. We refer to [Wo84, KV94] for the existence of Res and TR. The pointwise residue
Resx vanishes on operators with smooth kernels and the pointwise canonical trace TRx
vanishes on operators with smooth kernel supported outside the diagonal. Consequently,
(cid:3)

only A0 :=Psupp χi∩supp χ j,∅ χiAχ j arises in (42) and (43).

2.1.3. Characterisation of the Wodzicki residue and the canonical trace by means of their
locality. The Wodzicki residue on integer order classical operators (resp. the canonical
trace on non-integer order classical operators) is of the form

where λ is a linear form res (resp. −RRn) on the space of integer order (resp. non-integer

order) scalar-valued polyhomogeneous symbols on Rn.

Deﬁnition 2.3. We call local any linear form on a class of classical pseudodiﬀerential
operators of the form (44), the terminology reﬂecting the fact that it is an integrated density
ωΛ(A)(x) := λ ◦ tr (σ(A)(x, ·)) dx over M.
Theorem 2.4. Any local continuous9 linear10 form on the class ΨZ(M, E) of integer order
classical pseudodiﬀerential operators (resp. on the class Ψ<Z(X, F) of non-integer order
classical pseudodiﬀerential operators), which commutes with the ﬁbrewise trace on F, is
proportional to the Wodzicki residue Res (resp. the canonical trace TR).

Proof. Let k be the rank of E as a complex bundle over M.

• Let Λ be a covariant linear form of the type (44) on ΨZ(M, E) (resp. Ψ<Z(M, E))
with the linear form λ acting on scalar-values symbols.
The fact that ωΛ(A)(x) deﬁnes a density implies that for any local diﬀeomorphism
κ : U → U κ∗ωΛ(κ♯AU) = ωΛ(AU), where AU is a localisation of A in that chart. If
AU has symbol σ, following the notations of [Pa12], letgκ∗σ be the symbol of κ♯AU.
The above covariance property for the form ωΛ translates to |detκ∗| λ(cid:0)gκ∗σ(cid:1) = λ (σ)
for any local diﬀeomorphism κ : U → U.
• Choosing U to be an open ball and κ = t A for any A ∈ On(R) and 0 < t < 1, this
implies that in particular, λ should be invariant under rescaling (shrinking to be
exact) and isometric transformations.
On the other hand, λ is continuous for the Fr´echet topology on symbols of constant

9for the Fr´echet topology of classical pseudodiﬀerential operators of ﬁxed order (see e.g. [Pa12, p.117]

and references therein.

operators A and B in the set under consideration such that αA + B also lies in that set.

• Theorem 3.43 in [Pa12] characterises continuous rescaling and On(R)-invariant
linear forms on CS <Z(Rn)11 which turn out to be proportional to the canonical
integral. So there is a constant C such that λ = C −RRn on CS <Z(Rn). It follows
that on Ψ<Z
cl (M, M × C), the linear form Λ is proportional to the canonical trace
TR. Composing with the trace on matrices yields the expected characterisation on
Ψ<Z

• The covariance assumption of Theorem 4.21 in [Pa12]– which says that any co-
variant continuous linear form on CS Z(Rn) is proportional to the residue, the proof
of which relies on Theorem 3.43– can easily be relaxed to an invariance under
rescaling and isometric transformations. Thus, any continuous linear form on
CS Z(Rn) which is invariant under rescaling and isometric transformations is pro-
portional to the residue res. It follows that Λ on ΨZ
cl(M, M × C) is proportional
to the Wodzicki residue Res. Composing with the trace on matrices yields the
expected characterisation on CℓZ(M, E).

We use this locality in an essential way to lift trace defect formulae. Here is an imme-
diate corollary which uses the known traciality of the Wodzicki residue and the canonical
trace on the appropriate classes of operators they are deﬁned on.

der classical pseudodiﬀerential operators, resp. on the class Ψ<Z(M, E), is a trace, resp.

In particular, this holds if A(d j) is a diﬀerential operator, in which case TR(cid:16)A(d j)(cid:17) =

2.2.2. The index as a trace defect. We specialise to a Hermitian Z2-bundle E = E+ ⊕

selfadjoint elliptic diﬀerential operator in Ψcl(M, E) of positive order d. The operator
∆ := D−D+ ⊕ D+D− = D2 is essentially self-adjoint and has a ﬁnite dimensional kernel
Ker(∆).
Let ∆ + S be an invertible perturbation of ∆ by a smoothing operator S ∈ Ψ−∞cl (M, E);
typically S := χ{0}(∆), the orthogonal projection onto the kernel of ∆. The operator ∆ + S
is then a weight with principal angle θ = π. Applying the Z2-graded version of Proposition
2.6 to the family A(z) = φ (∆ + S )−z yields the following corollary.

Corollary 2.7. For any smooth function φ and any invertible perturbation ∆ +S as above,

Applying Corollary 2.7 to the constant 1-valued function φ yields the following formula

for the index.

kernel we write

ind(D+) = sTr(χ{0}(D))

= sTR(cid:0)(∆ + χ{0}(∆))−z(cid:1)

since the nonzero eigenvalues of D−D+ and D+D− coincide. This last expression deﬁnes
a constant meromorphic function, whose ﬁnite part at zero therefore coincides with the

and eE := π∗E → eM its pullback.
Let A ∈ Ψcl,Γ(eM,eE) be a Γ-invariant classical pseudodiﬀerential operator. Let x ∈ eM,
and σ(A)(x, ·) denote the symbol in in a local trivialisation around x.

Since A is Γ-invariant, the residue Resx(A) dx and the canonical trace TRx(A) dx densi-
ties introduced in Section 2.1 deﬁne Γ-invariant densities, leading to the following deﬁni-

tions. Let F ⊂ X be a fundamental domain for the action of Γ on eM :

Proposition 2.10. The residue and the canonical trace densities are well-deﬁned on lifted
classes ][A]diag of Deﬁnition 1.28 and are preserved under lifts.

Proof. Since the local residue (resp.
the canonical trace) vanishes on operators whose
Schwartz kernel is smooth we have Resx(A) = Resx(A0). (resp. and supported outside the
diagonal, we have TRx(A) = TRx(A0)).

• ResΓ( ][A]diag) = ResΓ(eA0) = Res(A0) = Res(A) = Res([A]diag) for A ∈ ΨZ
• TRΓ( ][A]diag) = TRΓ(eA0) = TR(A0) = TR([A]diag), for A ∈ Ψ<Z
Since σ(eA0) = ]σ(A0) (resp. σ−n(eA0) = σ−n(A0)∼, where n is the dimension of M), for

Integration over the fundamental domain then yields the result.

(cid:3)

Consequently, trace-defect formulae on closed manifolds recalled in Proposition 2.6

induce trace-defect formula on coverings.

Theorem 2.11. For any holomorphic family A(z) ∈ Ψcl,Γ(eM,eE) of classical operators
parametrised by C with holomorphic order −qz + a for some positive q and some real
number a,
(1) the map z 7→ TRΓ (A(z)) is meromorphic with simple poles dk := a+n−k

Proof. We use Proposition 1.27 to write A(z) ∼diag A(z)∼ with A(z) ε-local for some pos-
statements for A(z) = A(z)∼, and we have

itive ε. On the grounds of Proposition 2.10, without loss of generality we can show the

(53)
(1) then follows from the meromorphicity and the structure of the poles {dk, k ∈ Z≥0} of
TR(A(z)) discussed in Proposition 2.6. Similarly, (50) follows from (45) combined with
(see Proposition 2.6)

TRΓ(cid:16)gA(z)(cid:17) = TR (A(z)) .
ResΓ(cid:16)]A(d j)(cid:17) = Res(cid:16)A(d j)(cid:17) .

(54)
To prove (3) we assume that A(dk) has a well-deﬁned canonical trace, in which case ]A(dk)
has a well-deﬁned Γ-canonical trace. We apply (51) to the family A(z), which combined
with (53) yields

fpz=dkTRΓ(gA(z)) = fpz=dkTR (A(z))

Res(cid:0)A′(dk)(cid:1)

Since the operator A′(dk) has a well-deﬁned residue, the lifted derivative A′(dk)∼ has a well-

deﬁned Γ-residue and we have

ResΓ(cid:18)A′(dk)∼(cid:19) = Res(cid:0)A′(dk)(cid:1) ,

leading to (52).
The fact that these statements depend only on the class [A(z)]diag and not on the represen-
tative follows from the fact that TR and Res are well deﬁned on such classes.
(cid:3)
Corollary 2.12. Let A(z) be a holomorphic family of operators in Ψcl(M, E). For some
positive number ε, there is a holomorphic family A0(z) of ε-local operators in Ψcl(M, E)
such that A0(z) ∈ [A(z)]diag.

where TrΓ stands for the ordinary Γ-trace obtained by integrating the kernel along the
diagonal of the fundamental domain.

For any holomorphic family A(z) in Ψcl,Γ(eM,eE) such that the diﬀerence A(0) − A0(0)∼ at

fpz=0TRΓ (A(z)) − fpz=0TR (A(z)) = TrΓ(A(0) − A0(0)∼),

Proof. For some given positive ε, Deﬁnition 1.28 yields a family of ε-local operators
A0(z) in [A(z)]diag. The explicit construction of these operators by means of an appropriate
partition of unity shows that this family can be chosen holomorphic as a consequence of
the holomorphicity of A(z). It then follows from Proposition 2.10 that

TRΓ(cid:18)A0(z)∼(cid:19) = TR (A0(z)) = TR (A(z)) .

The operators B(z) := A(z) − A0(z)∼ deﬁne a holomorphic family in Ψcl,Γ(eM,eE). It follows

from the above that
fpz=0TRΓ (A(z)) − fpz=0TR (A(z)) = fpz=0TRΓ (A(z)) − fpz=0TR (A0(z)) = fpz=0TRΓ (B(z)) .

Assuming that the operator A(0) − A0(0)∼ has a smooth kernel, then the operator B(0) has
a smooth kernel and hence a vanishing Wodzicki residue. It then follows from Equation
(50) that the map z 7→ TRΓ (B(z)) has a vanishing complex residue at zero, showing its
holomorphicity at zero. The fact that B(0) has a smooth kernel also implies that it has a
well-deﬁned canonical trace which coincides with the ordinary Γ-trace TrΓ (B(0)) and we
have

fpz=0TRΓ (B(z)) = lim
z→0

TRΓ (B(z)) = TrΓ(B(0)) = TrΓ(A(0) − A0(0)∼).

Combining equations (56) and (57) yields (55).

2.4. Lifted regularised (super-)traces. This section is devoted to applications of For-
mula (55) in Corollary 2.12.
Let E be a hermitian vector bundle over a closed Riemannian manifold M, and let D be an
essentially self-adjoint diﬀerential operator in Ψ(M, E). Then ∆ := D2 is a non-negative
essentially self-adjoint operator.
For any ε > 0, let Qε(∆) be a weight as deﬁned in (28) and for a measurable function h on
on a contour Γπ around the ray Rπ =] − ∞, 0], such that

|h(λ)| ≤ |λ|−δ

In the speciﬁc case when h is polynomial, then h(∆) is a well-deﬁned diﬀerential operator,

for some positive δ, let h(Qε(∆)) be deﬁned by (30). Similarly, we consider h(Qε(e∆)) with
Qε(e∆) deﬁned by (35).
which lifts to h(∆)∼ = h(e∆). Let h be a measurable function h on a contour Γπ around
the ray Rπ =] − ∞, 0], satisfying (58) for some positive ∆, we set hε(∆) := h(Qε(∆)) and
hε(e∆) := h(Qε(e∆)).

z 7−→ TR(A(z)) − TRΓ(A(z)

is holomorphic at zero.
• There is some positive ε, and a ε-local operator A0 ∈ [P(D) hε(∆)]diag such that
the diﬀerencefA0 − P(eD) hε(e∆) has a smooth kernel and hence a well-deﬁned trace
TrΓ(cid:16)fA0 − P(eD) hε(e∆)(cid:17).
We have
TrQε(∆)(P(D) hε(∆)) − TrQε(e∆)

TrQε(∆)(P(D) h(∆)) = TrQε(e∆)

• Moreover, if h is a polynomial, then h(∆), h(e∆) are diﬀerential operators and we
(62)
• The above statements extend to super-regularised traces for operators acting on
sections of a Z2-graded bundle, replacing TrQε(∆) by its Z2-graded analog sTrQε(∆).
Proof. The operators Qε(∆)−z, resp. Qε(e∆)−z built from complex powers deﬁne holomor-
phic families on M, resp. eM and hence so do the operators A(z), resp. A(z) deﬁne ho-
molorphic families on M, resp. eM, to which we want to apply Corollary 2.12.
On the one hand as in Corollary 2.12, we build a ε-local holomorphic family A0(z) ∈
[A(z)]diag. In particular, the operator A0 := A0(0) has symbol P(σ(D)) ⋆ h⋆(σ(Qε(∆)).
So, on the one hand its lift fA0 has symbol P(σ(D)) ⋆ h⋆(σ(Qε(∆))∼. On the other hand,
the operator A(0) has symbol P(σ(eD)) ⋆ h⋆(σ(Qε(e∆))). By (33) applied to Q = Qε(e∆)
and Q = Qε(∆), we have h⋆(σ(Qε(e∆))) ∼ h⋆(σ(Qε(∆))∼. Consequently, using again the
locality of ⋆ as in Lemma 1.34, we ﬁnd that the operator A(0) has the same symbol as A0∼.
Hence the diﬀerence A(0) − A0∼ has a smooth kernel and therefore a well-deﬁned Γ-trace
TrΓ(cid:16)A(0) −fA0(cid:17).
Applying Corollary 2.12 yields the holomorphicity at z = 0 of the map z 7→ TRΓ (A(z)) −
TR (A(z)) and
TrQε(e∆)(A(0)) − TrQε(∆)(A(0)) = fpz=0(cid:18)TRΓ(A(z)) − TRΓ(A0(z)∼)(cid:19) = TrΓ(cid:16)A(0) −fA0(cid:17) ,
If h is a polynomial, then A(0) = P(D) h(∆) is a diﬀerential operator and we have P(eD) h(e∆) =
P(D) h(Qε(∆))∼ = A(0)∼ so that TrΓ(P(eD) h(e∆) − gA(0)) = 0, from which the assertion (62)

follows. Replacing TR by its Z2-graded analog sTR yields the last assertion

which corresponds to (61).

Let D+ : C∞(M, E+) → C∞(M, E−) be an elliptic diﬀerential operator of order d with

• For any m ∈ C, let S m
S ℜ(m)(U×Rn, glk(C)) such that there exists σm− j = σm− j(x, ξ) in C∞(cid:0)U × Rn \ {0}, glk(C)(cid:1),
j = 0, 1, 2, . . . with σm− j positively homogeneous of degree m− j with respect to ξ obeying

By Schwartz’s kernel theorem, to a continuous linear operator A : C∞c (U, Ck) → C∞(U, Ck) we

assign its (uniquely deﬁned) distributional Schwartz kernel KA ∈ D′(U × E) ⊗ glk(C).
Deﬁnition A.3.

for any m ∈ C), a continuous linear operator
A : C∞c (U, Ck) → C∞(U, Ck) is pseudodiﬀerential (resp. a classical pseudodiﬀerential
operator) of order m if it its kernel is an oscillatory integral of the type:

(1) For any m ∈ R (resp.
(2π)n ZRn

KA(x, y) =

1

(68)
where the amplitude a(x, y, ξ) lies in the symbol space S m(U × U × Rn, glk(C)) (resp.
cl(U × U × Rn, glk(C)).
S m

(2) To a given symbol σ ∈ S m(U × Rn, glk(C)) one assigns the pseudodiﬀerential operator

eihx−y,ξia(x, y, ξ) dξ,

(Op(σ)u)(x) =ZUZRn

ei(x−y)·ξ σ(x, ξ)u(y)dydξ, ∀u ∈ C∞c (U, Ck).

(69)

The operator Op(σ) is called classical if σ is.

Remark A.4.

(1) Given a symbol σ ∈ S m(U × Rn, glk(C)), the kernel K(x, y) of the operator
Op(σ) deﬁnes a tempered distribution in x− y, if moreover σ ∈ S −∞(U × Rn, glk(C)), then
K(x, y) is smooth on U × U.
(2) Conversely (see e.g. [EKS99, Comments following Th.1]), any smooth kernel K on U ×U
is the kernel of a pseudodiﬀerential operator with amplitude a(x, y, ξ) := (2π)n K(x, y) e−ihx−y,ξi ψ(ξ),
where ψ is a smooth function with compact support in Rn such thatRRn ψ(ξ) dξ = 1. The
amplitude a(x, y, ξ) lies in S −∞(U × Rn, glk(C)) since it is smooth in (x, y) and has compact
support in ξ.

12By excision function around a point we mean a smooth function on R which vanishes in a neighrbohood

of the point and is one outside a ball of radius one centered at this point.

The operator Op(σ) is a properly supported (see e.g. [Ta81, Def. 3.6]) pseudodiﬀerential oper-
ator, a concept we now recall; recall that the support of a distribution is the complement of the set
on which the distribution vanishes.
Deﬁnition A.5. Given an open subset U of Rn,

(1) a distribution T ∈ D′(U ×U, glk(C)) is properly supported if, for any compact K ⊂ U, its
support has compact intersection with K × U and U × K or equivalently, if the restriction
to the support of T of the two canonical projection maps U × U → U mapping (x, y) to x
and y respectively are proper maps (i.e., the preimage of a compact set is compact);
(2) an operator A : C∞c (U, Ck) → C∞(U, Ck) is properly supported if its Schwartz kernel is.
Remark A.6. Properly supported pseudodiﬀerential operators stablise C∞c (U, Ck) and are therefore
composable.
Proposition A.7. For any m ∈ R (resp. m ∈ C), the linear operator A : C∞c (U, Ck) → C∞(U, Ck)
is a (resp. classical) pseudodiﬀerential operator of order m if and only if it is of the form

A = Op(σA) + S (A),

(70)
cl(U × Rn, glk(C))) and S (A) is an operator with

where σ(A) ∈ S m(U × Rn, glk(C)) (resp. σ(A) ∈ S m
a smooth kernel supported outside the diagonal of U.
Proof. An operator of the form Op(σ) for some σ ∈ S m(U × Rn, glk(C)), m ∈ R, is a pseudodiﬀer-
ential operator of order m with amplitude a(x, y, ξ) = σ(x, ξ). On the other hand, by Remark A.4
2), any smooth kernel has an amplitude which lies in S −∞(U × U × Rn, glk(C)). Combining these
two facts, we conclude that any operator A of the form (70) is a psedudodiﬀerential operator of
order m; it is classical if its symbol σ(A) is classical.
Conversely, let A be a (resp. classical) pseudodiﬀerential operator of order m. Let ε > 0 and χε be
a smooth function with support containing the diagonal ∆U := {(x, x) ∈ U×U} such that χε is iden-
tically one on {m ∈ U × U : d(m, ∆U) ≤ ε
2} and identically zero on {m ∈ U × U : d(m, ∆U) ≥ ε}.
We split the Schwartz kernel KA of A accordingly

KA = χε KA + (1 − χε)KA .

Both projection maps supp(χε) → U are proper, so χε KA is properly supported and corresponds
to the kernel of some pseudodiﬀerential operator Op(σA) with symbol σ(A)(x, ξ) = e−ihx,ξi A eihx,ξi
in S m(U × Rn, glk(C)) (see e.g. [Ta81, Thm. 3.8], [Sc10, (1.5.3.8)] and the comments that follow).
The kernel (1 − χε)KA is smooth and supported outside the diagonal ∆U.
(cid:3)

This leads to the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition A.8.

• For any m ∈ R, let Ψm(U, Ck) is the class of all linear operators A :
C∞c (U, Ck) → C∞(U, Ck) of the form (70), with symbol σA ∈ S m(U, glk(C)) and S (A) an
operator with a smooth Schwartz kernel KS (A) ∈ C∞(U × U, glk(C)) supported outside the
diagonal of U;
cl(U, Ck) is the class of all linear operators A ∈ Ψm(U, Ck) whose symbol
• For any m ∈ C, Ψm
σA lies in S m

A ∼ B ⇐⇒ σ(A) ∼ σ(B) ⇐⇒ σm− j(A) = σm− j(B) ∀ j ∈ Z≥0.

(72)

Whereas diﬀerential operators are local, pseudo-diﬀerential operators are not local for they
smear out the supports of the sections on which they act. However, they are pseudo-local in so far
as they do not smear out their singular supports. The following deﬁnition captures some features
of pseudo-locality.
Deﬁnition A.10. [Sh92, Def. 3 pag. 98] An operator A : C∞c (U, Ck) → C∞(U, Ck) with Schwartz
kernel KA is C-local for some C ≥ 0, if KA(x, y) = 0 ∀x, y with |x − y| > C or equivalently, if

∀u ∈ C∞c (U, Ck);

supp(Au) ⊂ {x : d(x, supp u) ≤ C}.

Example A.11. Diﬀerential operators are 0-local operators.

Remark A.12. C-local operators are properly supported.

Appendix B. Coverings and Γ-Hilbert modules

We recall some useful deﬁnitions, referring to [Sc05].

Deﬁnition B.1. Let A be a C∗-algebra.

(1) An A-Hilbert module is a right A-module V with an A-valued inner product h·,·i obeying
the expected properties, namely it is A-sesquilinear, and for any v ∈ V the expression
hv, vi is a non-negative self-adjoint element in A whose square root deﬁned a norm on V
for which V is complete. In particular, An is a Hilbert module for any n ∈ N.
(2) A ﬁnitely generated projective Hilbert A -module V is a Hilbert A -module which is iso-
morphic as Hilbert A -module to a (closed) orthogonal direct summand of An for suitable
n ∈ N . In other words, there is a Hilbert A -module W such that V ⊕ W ≃ An. The range
of the projection P : An → An with range V and kernel W is a ﬁnitely generated projective
Hilbert module.

For a given A-Hilbert module V, let EndA(V) be the algebra of Hilbert module morphisms,

namely continuous A-linear maps on V which have an adjoint. Then

EndA(V) ≃ B(V) ⊗ A

is a C∗-algebra. If A is a von Neumann algebra, so is EndA(V) a von Neumann algebra (see e.g.
[La95]).

We now apply the previous construction to the von Neumann algebra13 of a countable discrete

group Γ, which we ﬁrst deﬁne. Let ℓ2(Γ) be the completion of C Γ for the norm kPg∈Γ ag gk2 =
13Recall that a von Neumann algebra is a ∗-algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space that is closed
in the weak operator topology and contains the identity operator. The weak operator topology is the weakest
topology on the set of bounded operators on a Hilbert space, such that the functional sending an operator T
to the complex number < T x, y > is continuous for any vectors x and y in the Hilbert space.

ag bg,

ℓ2(Γ) is a Hilbert space and via the right regular representation, CΓ can be viewed as a subalgebra
of the C∗-algebra B (ℓ2(Γ)) of bounded linear operators on ℓ2(Γ). The group von Neumann algebra
N Γ is the closure of C Γ in B (ℓ2(Γ)) with respect to the weak operator topology.
Example B.2. Take Γ = Zn. The Fourier transform gives an isometric Zn-equivariant isomorphism
ℓ2(Zn) → L2(Tn), where Tn is the n-dimensional torus. Therefore N Zn coincides with the commu-
tant L(L2(T n))Zn of the Zn-action on L2(Tn), and one obtains an isomorphism N Zn ≃ L∞(Tn).
Deﬁnition B.3.

(1) The Kaplansky trace, also called Γ-trace on N Γ is the linear form trΓ :

N Γ → C deﬁned as
where a =Pg∈Γ ag g and e ∈ CΓ is the element with all components zero outside the ﬁrst
P = (pi j) ∈ gln (N Γ) is

(2) The Γ-dimension of a ﬁnitely generated Γ-module V represented by an idempotent matrix

trΓ(a) = ha e, ei = ae,

one which is one.

dimΓ(V) :=

nXi=1

trΓ(pii) = trΓ(cid:16)trgln(C)(P)(cid:17) ,

where trgln(C) is the matrix trace given by the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix
with complex entries.

(3) More generally, the Γ-trace extends to any operator T ∈ EndN Γ(V) ≃ B(V) ⊗ N Γ by

trΓ(T ) := trΓ(cid:16)trgln(C)(T P)(cid:17) .

τ( f ) =ZTn

Example B.4. The Kaplansky trace on N Zn ≃ L∞(Tn) is given by the integration map against the
canonical volume measure on the ﬂat torus:

f dµ.

(73)

Let M be a closed manifold with π1(M) = Γ, let π : eM → M be a universal covering of M,
with Γ acting on the right by deck transformations. Then ℓ2(Γ) is a ﬁnite type N Γ-module for
ℓ2(Γ) ≃ (N Γ)2, the L2-closure of N Γ. More generally, we have
Lemma B.5. Let eM be a Γ-covering of M. The bundle H → M deﬁned by
H = eM ×Γ ℓ2Γ
is a ﬂat bundle of ﬁnitely generated projective N Γ-modules.
Proof. This follows from the fact that the left Γ-action and the right N Γ-action on ℓ2(Γ) commute
so H := eM×Γ ℓ2(Γ) is a ﬁnitely generated projective bundle of (right) N Γ-Hilbert modules over M.
Moreover, H is endowed with a ﬂat structure since the transition functions are locally constant. (cid:3)
There is a well known dictionary between the space of L2-sections of eE on eM and the sections
of the bundle E twisted by H, for which we refer for example to [Sc05, 7.5] or [PS07, Prop. E.6]
for full details.
Let us ﬁrst recall that the space Cc(eM,eE) is a right CΓ-module with structure given by (ξ ·
s)( ˜x) =Pg∈Γ(R∗gξ)( ˜x)s(g−1), where R∗g denotes the pullback map, s is in CΓ and ξ ∈ Cc(eM,eE). By
completion, this endows L2(eM,eE) with the structure of right N Γ-module.

30

SARA AZZALI AND SYLVIE PAYCHA

Deﬁnition B.6. Let s be a section of eE. Deﬁne the section Φ(s) of E ⊗ H by

Φ(s)(x) = ˆs(x) =Xγ∈Γ

s(γ ˜x) ⊗ [ ˜x, γ]

where ˜x is an arbitrary lift of x ∈ M, and eEγ ˜x is identiﬁed with Ex.
The map s 7→ ˆs = Φ(s) identiﬁes {s ∈ C∞c (eM,eE)| Pγ |s(γx)|2 < ∞} with C∞ (M, E ⊗ H). It

extends to an isometry

Φ : L2( ˜M,eE) → L2(M, E ⊗ H)

of N Γ-Hilbert modules.
Example B.7. To the universal covering π : Rn → Tn with fundamental group Zn corresponds the
ﬁnitely generated projective bundle H := Rn ×Zn ℓ2(Zn) of (right) L∞(Tn)-Hilbert modules over
Tn. In this correspondence, L2-functions on Rn are viewed as L2-sections of the bundle H over Tn
via the map which sends f to ˆf : x 7→Pγ∈Zn f (γπ−1(x)) ⊗ [π−1(x), γ]. This induces an isometry
Φ: L2(Rn) ≃ L2(Tn) ⊗ ℓ2(Zn) −→ L2(Tn,H)
which sends { f ∈ C∞(Rn) :Pγ∈Zn | f (γx)|2 < ∞ ∀x ∈ Rn} to C∞(Tn,H).

Deﬁnition B.8. To any ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operator D on C∞(M, E), one can assign the ﬁrst

(75)

DH ( ˆs) (x) :=Xγ∈Γ

˜D ˜s(γ ˜x) ⊗ [ ˜x, γ],

locally on an evenly covered neighborhood U of x ∈ M, with lift eU an open set such that πU is a
diﬀeomorphism, so that U ∋ y 7→ [˜y, γ] is a ﬂat section of H for all γ ∈ Γ.

The following proposition is proved in [Sc05] (see also [BP09, Proposition 3.12]). We sketch

the proof in this appendix for the sake of completeness.

Proposition B.9. ([Sc05]) The map

yields an isometry of N Γ-Hilbert modules which for any ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operator D on
C∞(M, E) satiﬁes

Appendix C. The groupoid interpretation

We use the notations of the previous appendix. An equivalent description of the calculus of Γ-

space

invariant operators on the covering eM involves the fundamental groupoid G deﬁned as the quotient
of eM × eM by the diagonal action γ · ( ˜x, ˜y) := (γ · ˜x, γ · ˜y). The groupoid structure on G is given in

terms of the space of units is G(0) = M and the source and range maps

G := (eM × eM)/Γ

s[( ˜x, ˜y)] := π( ˜x)

,

r[( ˜x, ˜y)] := π(˜y) .

For further details on the structure of this groupoid we refer to [BP09, Section 2] in the more
general setting of the monodromy groupoid of a foliated bundle.

Pseudodiﬀerential calculus on groupoids was introduced by Connes [Co79], Nistor–Weinstein–
Xu [NWX99], Monthubert–Pierrot [MP97] and by Vassout [Vas06] in relation with the Wodzicki
residue. We will compare it here with the calculus developed by Vassout which bears the advantage
of including a large subalgebra of non properly supported smoothing operators and is therefore well
suited for the construction of complex powers [Vas06].

any x ∈ G(0) let Gx := s−1(x).
the G-invariance condition

Let G be a diﬀerentiable groupoid and E → G(0) a vector bundle on its space of units, and for
One considers families A = (Ax)x∈M, where Ax is an operator acting on C∞c (Gx, r∗(E)), satisfying
(76)
where Ug : C∞(Gs(g), r∗(E)) → C∞(Gr(g), r∗(E)) is (Ug f )(g′) := f (g′g). The support of a family A
is is a subset of {(g, h) ∈ G × G, s(g) = s(h)} deﬁned as

Ar(g)Ug = UgAd(g)

supp(A) := [x∈G(0)

supp(Ax).

Deﬁnition C.1. [NWX99, Deﬁnition 8] The family A is said to be

p1, p2 : G × G → G are the projections on the two factors;

• properly supported, if p−1
• compactly supported, if supp(A) is compact;
• uniformly supported, if µ1(supp(A)) is compact (where µ1(g, h) := gh−1).

(K)∩ supp(A) is compact for any compact subset K ⊂ G, where

The algebra of G-pseudodiﬀerential operators (resp. classical G-pseudodiﬀerential operators in

the sense of Vassout) consists of two building blocks:

a) an algebra Ψcpt(G, E) whose elements are smooth14 families A = (Ax)x∈M where Ax is a
(resp. classical) pseudodiﬀerential operator acting on C∞c (Gx, r∗(E)), such that A is G-
invariant and compactly supported

b) an algebra Ψ−∞(G, E) of smoothing operators deﬁned by means of a scale of Sobolev
modules H s(W), s ∈ R, on the groupoid C∗-algebra (see [Vas06, Proposition 4.2.5]) as
the intersection
(77)
of the spaces of linear maps which take a Sobolev module H s(W) to another Sobolev
module Ht(W).
Deﬁnition C.2. A (resp. classical) pseudodiﬀerential operator in the sense of [Vas06] consists of
a sum

Ψ−∞(G) = ∩s,tL(cid:16)H s(W), Ht(W)(cid:17)

A = A0 + S (A), A0 ∈ Ψcpt(G, E), S (A) ∈ Ψ−∞(G, E),

(resp. with A classical). The linear space generated by (resp. classical) pseudodiﬀerential operators
of order m ∈ R (resp. m ∈ C) is denoted by Ψm(G, E) (resp. Ψm
cl(G, E)) and the whole algebra
generated by such operators by Ψ(G, E) (resp. Ψcl(G, E)).

14The degree of regularity can be chosen according to the needs.

32

SARA AZZALI AND SYLVIE PAYCHA

Example C.3. In the case of the pair groupoid G = M× M of a closed smooth manifold G(0) := M,
Ψcpt(G, E) corresponds to the set of compactly supported operators on M, which in particular are
properly supported [NWX99, Example 1], so Ψm(G, E) = Ψm(M, E) for any m ∈ R.
We now focus on the case G = (eM×eM)/Γ, and summarize the relations between pseudodiﬀerential
operators on eM of Section 1.2.2 with pseudodiﬀerential operators on G given in [NWX99, Example
4], [Vas06, §6], see also [BP09, §3.2].
Each ﬁbre Gx := s−1(x) can be identiﬁed to eM via the map
˜p 7→ [ ˜x0, ˜p],
where ˜x0 is a ﬁxed element in π−1(x). The identiﬁcation of Gx with eM is unique up to the action
Given a family A = (Ax)x∈M, the G-invariance condition (76) implies that Ax is Γ-invariant.
Hence the family A can be identiﬁed with a Γ-invariant operator on eM.
Proposition C.4. [NWX99, Example 4], [Vas06, 6] Let G = (eM × eM)/Γ. One has the following

ρx : eM → Gx
