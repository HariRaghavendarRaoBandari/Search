Abstract. Neutron-star mergers are interesting for several reasons: they are proposed as the progenitors of short gamma-ray bursts,
they have been speculated to be a site for the synthesis of heavy elements, and they emit gravitational waves possibly detectable
at terrestrial facilities. The understanding of the merger process, from the pre-merger stage to the ﬁnal compact object-accreting
system involves detailed knowledge of numerical relativity and nuclear physics. In particular, key ingredients for the evolution of
the merger are neutrino physics and the matter equation of state. We present some aspects of neutrino emission from binary neutron
star mergers showing the impact that the equation of state has on neutrinos and discuss some spectral quantities relevant to their
detection such as energies and luminosities far from the source.

INTRODUCTION

Together with gravity neutrinos drive the evolution of several stellar phenomena such as supernovae, binary mergers,
and black hole accretion disks. They are also a key ingredient in the synthesis of heavy elements [1, 2], the production
of gamma ray bursts [3, 4] and kilonova [5, 6]. Despite the numerous eﬀorts to fully understand these phenomena
there are still puzzles to address. Unrevealing the missing pieces requires complex and computationally expensive
simulations of the system under study that bring together details of nuclear physics and gravity. Furthermore, due to
the complexity of the problem, it is necessary to post-process the results to shed light on other derived aspects such as
the element abundances and neutrino detection.

The strong gravitational ﬁeld generated by a binary neutron star merger changes the spectral properties of the
emerging neutrinos. This will aﬀect any physical quantity related to them. For example, the emitted neutrinos can
interact with matter outﬂowing the merger. Via weak interactions neutrinos will change the neutron to proton ratio
(electron fraction) of the outﬂow setting the path that a nuclear reaction chain follows. However, strong gravity eﬀects,
such as redshifts and bending of neutrino trajectories, aﬀect the neutrino ﬂuxes altering the electron fraction. As a
consequence the ﬁnal abundances diﬀer from those obtained in the absence of the gravitational ﬁeld [7]. On another
hand, if the merger occurs in the Milky way or in the local galaxy group chances are that we will able to detect those
neutrinos with current and future facilities [8, 9, 10]. It is therefore interesting to study the behavior of neutrinos
emitted from binary systems.

In this proceedings we present post-processed neutrino emission results from state of the art 3D fully relativistic
binary neutron star simulations with magnetic ﬁelds, neutrino cooling and diﬀerent equations of state. The original
simulation results of the coalescence have been presented in reference [11]. There, the evolution of the matter in con-
nection to the Equation of State (EoS) is discussed, as well as the gravitational wave emission and neutrino detection
rates. Here, we expand our discussion of neutrino emission focusing on the evolution of the neutrino surface and its
relation to the EoS.

EQUATION OF STATE

The EoS connects the macroscopic thermodynamical variables to the microphysics of the neutron star. Observables
such as maximum masses and radii carry important information about the behavior of nuclear matter at high densi-

ties. Similarly, our theoretical models of nuclear interactions should correctly account for these observables. Among
other macroscopic variables, the EoS predicts the temperature, density and matter composition. The neutrino absorp-
tion and emission rates are correlated to these same quantities. A microphysical EoS is therefore fundamental to
track the merger dynamics and the neutrino emission. We consider three diﬀerent EoS (tables publically available at
www.stellarcollapse.org), NL3, DD2, SFHo, all of them in the frame of the statistical model of Hempel and Schaﬀner-
Bielich [12]. They diﬀer in the relativistic mean ﬁeld model used to describe the nuclear interaction. The NL3 EoS is
based on the interaction model of reference [13], the DD2 on [14] and the SFHo on [15]. These EoS predict diﬀerent
radii and maximum masses. The EoS is said to be soft if results in a small radius for a given mass and is stiﬀ if for the
same mass the predicted radius is larger. Our simulations consider the coalescence of two neutron stars each with a
mass of 1.35M(cid:12). The SFHo predicts for that mass a neutron star radius of ≈ 12 km. The DD2 predicts a close to 13 km
radius while for the NL3 the radius is ≈ 15 km. In that order of ideas the SFHo is the softest of the EoS considered,
the DD2 is an intermediate EoS and the NL3 is the stiﬀest one.

NEUTRINO EMISSION

Post-merger neutrino luminosities can be as large as 1054 erg/s. This huge amount of neutrinos can reach detectors
on Earth and tell us valuable information about the merger and its evolution. At high matter densities (≈ 1014 g/cm3)
neutrinos are trapped: the neutrino mean free path λν is shorter than the physical dimensions of the merger, i. e. matter
is neutrino opaque. Once the density decreases the neutrino mean free path increases and neutrinos escape carrying
energy away and contributing to the cooling of the system. The point of last scattering, the place where neutrinos are
free, is known as the neutrino surface. A common approach to determine this surface is to ﬁnd the places where the
optical depth τ = 2/3 (see e.g. [16]). In terms of the opacity κν, and the mean free path lν, the optical depth τ is given
by

along the propagation direction ˆs. In this post-processing we chose to study the neutrino emission as seen from an
observer located at inﬁnity in the z-axis. Then, the neutrino surfaces are deﬁned by the two-dimensional hypersurfaces
where the optical depth of the merger is perpendicular to the equatorial plane. This turns the optical depth into

We integrate Equation 2 changing the lower limit zν until the value τ = 2/3 is reached. The themodynamical conditions
of the neutrino surface are therefore the conditions of the matter at zν.

In Equation 2 the mean free path depends of the cross sections σk,

and fFD is the neutrino occupation number. We assume the temperature is equal to the local temperature and zero
chemical potential. This procedure removes the energy dependence of the neutrino surface. Note, that the scattering
neutrino surfaces introduced above diﬀer from the eﬀective neutrino surfaces (see e.g. [17]). The ﬁrst ones correspond
to the last scattering surfaces, where absorption and scattering neutrino processes are treated equally while in the
calculation of the eﬀective neutrino surfaces more emphasis is given to absorption processes. The eﬀective surfaces

The sum above goes over all the relevant scattering and absorption processes k that neutrinos undergo as they diﬀuse
through matter, with nk the number density of the target. (cid:104)σk(Eν)(cid:105) is the thermally averaged (“weighted”) cross section,

would be however diﬀuse in area but will give a better estimate of the neutrino temperature, while the scattering sur-
faces will give a better estimate of the eﬀective area of decoupling. As our calculation for average energies (explained
below) is thermally weighted over the Fermi-Dirac distribution we expect that they will be good estimates.

In this analysis we consider neutrino scattering from protons, neutrons and electrons, as is a good approximation
to assume that matter is dissociated at the typical values of T =10 MeV (and above) found in simulations. In this way
we have the charged current processes

and

(7)
We also consider neutral current processes, elastic scattering from electrons and neutrino-antineutrino annihilation,
which aﬀect on equal footing all neutrino ﬂavors. We ﬁnd proton and neutron number densities assuming charge
neutrality Ye = Yp, and the electron number density assuming equilibrium of thermal electrons and positrons with
radiation. Details on the cross sections of the above reactions can be found in ref. [10]. As the heavy lepton neutrinos,
tau and muon, do not undergo the process of equations 6 and 7 they are the ﬁrst to decouple form matter. Also as the
medium is neutron-rich, due to the original neutron richness of the neutron stars, the last ones to decouple are electron
neutrinos given the predominance of the reaction of equation 6.

Evolution of the neutrino surface: the DD2 EoS

Following the methodology of the previous section we ﬁnd the neutrino surfaces for the three diﬀerent neutrino
ﬂavors. The electron antineutrino surface at t = 7.4 ms after the merger for the DD2 EoS is presented in Figure 2. The
height represents the distance, measured from the equatorial plane, at which neutrinos decouple from matter, whereas
the color scale shows the matter temperature at these last points of neutrino scattering. With these temperatures we
determine the average neutrino energies as described above.

FIGURE 1. The electron antineutrino surface at t=7.4 ms after the merger for the DD2 EoS.

Figure 2 shows the time evolution of the electron antineutrino surface for the DD2 EoS as seen from the z-axis.
The time after the merger is as indicated in the ﬁgure. Although, electron antineutrinos achieve larger temperatures,
around 18 MeV, at earlier times near the center for t=2.5 ms after the merger, larger areas are warmed up at latter
times. The highest temperature for electron antineutrino decreases ∼ 12 MeV at t= 7.4 ms, but matter is overall
warmer leading to the larger neutrino luminosities as reported in [11]. For even latter times, t=12.3 and 17.2 ms, the
ﬂux of neutrinos has contributed to the matter cooling and the neutrinos temperatures decrease.

Neutrino surfaces for diﬀerent EoS

Figure 3 shows the neutrino surfaces for electron neutrino, electron antineutrino and tau/muon neutrino for diﬀerent
EoS at similar times after the merger. The SFHo EoS results in over all warmer larger surfaces which is a result
of a more violent collision: the softer EoS allows smaller neutron star radii, therefore the merger happens deeper
in the gravitational potential. A fraction of this gravitational energy is converted to neutrino energy. In contrast the
stiﬀest EoS NL3 predicts larger radii. This means the merger occur at earlier times and less deep in the potential. As
a consequence the gravitational energy available for conversion to neutrino energy is smaller compared to the SFHo
case. The intermediate surfaces are the DD2. We expect then that a neutrino signal will be more energetic for the
SFHo, then DD2 and last for the NL3 EoS. Table 2 shows the average neutrino energies observed at inﬁnity with our
estimates. The values in the table are identical to those reported in table III of reference [11] and we write them here
for completeness.

EoS will follow a similar time evolution of as the DD2 case discussed above. Before the merger the matter is cold and
there is not signiﬁcant neutrino emission. Soon after the merger matter is warmed up and neutrino production becomes
important. Howerver, due to the high densities neutrinos are trapped. As time passes the temperature increases and
neutrinos leave the merger. Their luminosites reach a maximum which depends on the EoS. Between 4.5 ms and 15
ms for DD2, and between 3 and 9 ms for NL3, a quasi-stationary state is reached where the neutrino luminosities are
slightly lower than the maximum value. However, for the SFHo EoS, this state is not reached as the hyper massive
neutron star, result of the merger, collapses to a black hole. Therefore, for the cases studied here neutrinos with larger
energies could be a signature of a softer EoS.

CONCLUSIONS

Binary neutron star mergers represent a wonderful laboratory to contrast our theoretical predictions with observations.
From one side the occurrence of an event will produce a gravitational wave signal suﬃciently strong to be detected at
existent facilities such as Advanced LIGO. On the other hand, we will be also able to detect neutrinos emitted during
the merger with current and future water Cherenkov detectors (such as Super Kamiokande). Furthermore, we expect
that from these mentioned signals we will gain information from the EoS and consequently about the nuclear force. In
this proceedings we have discussed the inﬂuence that the EoS has on the neutrino emission from binary neutron star
mergers.

We have followed the evolution of the neutrino surface for the DD2 EoS, and found that for earlier times the
neutrino production is low due to the higher densities of the system. At later times (about 2.5 ms after merger) the
neutrino production peaks as the matter distribution is more even and the temperatures increase. At this stage the
neutrino surface temperatures are high and neutrinos have an average energy at inﬁnity around 18 MeV. Finally, the
emission decreases as the system losses energy via neutrinos. This quasi-steady state last for some milliseconds. We
showed that the stiﬀness of the EoS changes the neutrino energies. A soft EoS like the SFHo will produce hotter
and higher energy neutrinos compared to the stiﬀer NL3 EoS. For all cases the neutrino emission will last tens of
milliseconds. This together with the higher neutrino energies of the merger will allow us to distinguish this signal
from a Supernovae one which is estimated to be around 10 seconds.

Fully relativistic hydrodynamical simulations with realistic EoS represent a valuable method to understand the
evolution of neutron star mergers. Together with an accurate description of neutrino ﬂuxes and nuclear reaction net-
works that determine the elements produced during these events will shed light on our understanding of the production
of heavy elements. Future eﬀorts will be focused on this problem.
