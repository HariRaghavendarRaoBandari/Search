Abstract In this paper, the theory of space-time in 4-dimensional K¨ahler manifold
has been studied. We have also discussed the Einstein equation with cosmological
constant in perfect ﬂuid K¨ahlerian space-time manifold. By taking conformally ﬂat
perfect ﬂuid K¨ahler space-time manifold, we have obtained interesting results related
to sectional curvatures. In last two sections we have studied weakly symmetric and
weakly Ricci symmetric perfect ﬂuid K¨ahler space-time manifolds.

Keywords: K¨ahlerian space-time manifold. Einstein equation. conformally ﬂat man-
ifold. weakly symmetric manifold. weakly Ricci symmetric manifold

1 Introduction

The study of space time is associated with 4-dimensional semi-Riemannian manifolds
equipped with Lorentz metric g having signature (-,+,+,+). B. O’Neill [12] discussed
the application of semi-Riemannian geometry in the theory of relativity. The curvature
structure of the space-time is studied by V. R. Kaigorodov [9] in 1983. After then,
these ideas of general relativity of space-time are extended by A. K. Roychaudhury,
S. Banerji and A. Banerji [14], M. C. Chaki and S. Roy [2], A. A. Shaikh, Dae Won
Yoon and S. K. Hui [15], U. C. De and G. C. Ghosh [5] and many other Diﬀerential
Geometers and Physicist.

In 2004 U. C. De and G. C. Ghosh [5] considered the weakly Ricci symmetric
space-time manifold and obtained some results related to it. The weakly symmetric
and weakly Ricci symmetric manifolds are introduced by L. Tamassy and T. Q. Binh
[1, 16]. Also, M. Prvanovic [13] and U. C. De and S. Bandyopdhayay [3] explained it
with examples. L. Tamassy, U. C. De and T. Q. Binh [17] also found some interesting
results related to weakly symmetric and weakly Ricci symmetric K¨ahler manifolds.

An n-dimensional Riemannian manifold is said to be a weakly symmetric if the

curvature tensor R of type (0,4) of the manifold satisﬁes

(∇X R)(Y, Z, U, V ) =A(X)R(Y, Z, U, V )

(1.1)

+ B(Y )R(X, Z, U, V ) + C(Z)R(Y, X, U, V )
+ D(U )R(Y, Z, X, V ) + E(V )R(Y, Z, U, X),

1

and if the Ricci tensor S of the manifold satisﬁes

(1.2)

(∇X S)(Y, Z) = A(X)S(Y, Z) + B(Y )S(X, Z) + C(Z)S(Y, X),

then manifold is called weakly Ricci symmetric manifold. Where A, B, C, D, E are
simultaneously non-vanishing 1-forms and X, Y, Z, U, V are vector ﬁelds.

In 1995, Prvanovic [13] proved that if the manifold be a weakly symmetric manifold
satisfying (1.1) then B = C = D = E. In this paper we have taken B = C = D =
E = ω, therefore, the equations (1.1) and (1.2) can be written as

(1.3)

and

(1.4)

(∇X R)(Y, Z, U, V ) =A(X)R(Y, Z, U, V )

+ ω(Y )R(X, Z, U, V ) + ω(Z)R(Y, X, U, V )

+ ω(U )R(Y, Z, X, V ) + ω(V )R(Y, Z, U, X),

(∇X S)(Y, Z) = A(X)S(Y, Z) + ω(Y )S(X, Z) + ω(Z)S(Y, X),

where g(X, ρ) = ω(X) and g(X, α) = A(X).

Recently, U. C. De and A. De [4], A. De, C. ¨Ozg¨ur and U. C. De [7] extended the
theory of space-time by studying the application of almost pseudo-conformally sym-
metric Ricci-recurrent manifolds and conformally ﬂat almost pseudo Ricci-symmetric
manifolds respectively. In 2012 and 2014, S. Mallick and U. C. De [6, 11] gave ex-
amples of weakly symmetric and conformally ﬂat weakly Ricci symmetric space-time
manifolds and proved that a conformally ﬂat weakly Ricci symmetric space-time with
non-zero scalar curvature is the Robertson-Walker space-time and the vorticity and the
shear vanish. Also, they have shown that a weakly symmetric perfect ﬂuid space-time
with cyclic parallel Ricci tensor can not admit heat ﬂux. In 2014, U. C. De and Lju-
bica Velimirovic [8] explained the space-time with semi-symmetric energy-momentum
tensor and proved that a space-time manifold with semi-symmetric energy momentum
tensor is Ricci semi-symmetric.

In the consequence of this type of development we have studied the general relativ-
ity of space-time in 4-dimensional K¨ahler manifold and this type of manifold is called
the K¨ahlerian space-time manifold.

A 4-dimensional space-time manifold is said to be a K¨ahlerian space-time manifold

if the following conditions hold:

(1.5)

(1.6)

(1.7)

F 2(X) = −X,

g(X, Y ) = g(X, Y ),

(∇X F )(Y ) = 0,

where, F is a tensor ﬁeld of type (1,1) such that F (X) = X, g is a Riemannian metric
and ∇ is a Levi-Civita connection.

We know that in a K¨ahler manifold the Ricci tensor S satisﬁes

(1.8)

S(X, Y ) = S(X, Y ).

2

2 Perfect ﬂuid K¨ahler space-time manifold

We know that the Einstein equation with cosmological constant for the perfect ﬂuid
space-time is given by

(2.1)

S(X, Y ) −

r
2

g(X, Y ) + λg(X, Y ) = k[(σ + p)ω(X)ω(Y ) + pg(X, Y )],

where k is the gravitational constant, σ is energy density, p is isotropic pressure of
the ﬂuid and ω is 1-form deﬁned by ω(X) = g(X, ρ) for time-like vector ﬁeld ρ. The
time-like vector ﬁeld ρ is called velocity of the ﬂuid and satisﬁes g(ρ, ρ) = −1. Also,
the energy density σ and the pressure p can be described in the sense that if σ vanishes
then content matter of the ﬂuid is not pure and if the pressure p vanishes then the
ﬂuid is dust.

Now replacing X and Y by X and Y respectively in (2.1) and using (1.6) and (1.8),

we get

(2.2)

S(X, Y ) −

r
2

g(X, Y ) + λg(X, Y ) = k[(σ + p)ω(X)ω(Y ) + pg(X, Y )].

Subtracting (2.1) from (2.2), we have

(2.3)

k(σ + p)[ω(X)ω(Y ) − ω(X)ω(Y )] = 0.

Putting Y = ρ in (2.3), we obtained

(2.4)

k(σ + p)ω(X) = 0,

since k 6= 0 and ω(X) 6= 0, we have

(2.5)

σ + p = 0,

which shows the ﬂuid behaves like a cosmological constant. Also from (2.5), we have
σ = −p which represents a rapid expansion of space-time in cosmology and known as
Inﬂation.

Now using (2.5), equation (2.1) gives

(2.6)

S(X, Y ) = (

r
2

− λ + k.p)g(X, Y ).

Putting X = Y = ei, 1 ≤ i ≤ 4 in (2.6) and taking summation over i, we can easily
obtained

(2.7)

From (2.6) and (2.7), we get

(2.8)

λ − k.p =

r
4

.

S(X, Y ) =

r
4

g(X, Y ).

Hence from above discussion, we conclude the following:

Theorem 2.1. If M be a perfect ﬂuid K¨ahler space-time manifold satisfying the Ein-
stein equation with cosmological constant then
(i) the Einstein equation is independent of the isotropic pressure p, energy density σ,
cosmological constant λ and the gravitational constant k.
(ii) the space-time manifold is an Einstein manifold.

3

Since an Einstein manifold is the manifold of constant scalar curvature r, therefore,
equation (2.7) implies the pressure p is constant and hence from (2.5) we have the
energy density σ is constant.

It is well known [12] that the Energy equation for the perfect ﬂuid is given by

(2.9)

ρ.σ = −(σ + p)divρ.

Using (2.5) in (2.9), we get

(2.10)

ρ.σ = 0.

Above equation implies σ = 0 as ρ 6= 0. Because if ρ = 0 then we have contradiction
that g(ρ, ρ) = −1. But then the equation (2.5) gives p = 0 and hence the energy
momentum tensor T (X, Y ) = (σ + p)ω(X)ω(Y ) + pg(X, Y ) vanishes.
Thus we conclude:

Theorem 2.2. If M be a perfect ﬂuid K¨ahler space-time manifold satisfying the Ein-
stein equation with cosmological constant then
(i) the energy density σ and the isotropic pressure p vanish i.e. the content matter of
the ﬂuid is not pure and the perfect ﬂuid is dust.
(ii) the energy momentum tensor T (X, Y ) vanishes i.e. the space-time is vaccum.

Since the velocity vector ﬁeld ρ is constant, we have

(2.11)

divρ = 0 and ∇ρρ = 0.

Hence from equations (2.11), we can state:

Theorem 2.3. If M be a perfect ﬂuid K¨ahler space-time manifold satisfying Einstein
equation with cosmological constant then the expansion scalar and the acceleration
vector vanish.

3 Conformally ﬂat perfect ﬂuid K¨ahler space-time

manifold

The Weyl conformal curvature tensor C on an n-dimensional manifold M is deﬁned
by

C(X, Y, Z, T ) =R(X, Y, Z, T ) −

1

(n − 2)

[S(Y, Z)g(X, T )

(3.1)

− S(X, Z)g(Y, T ) + S(X, T )g(Y, Z)

− S(Y, T )g(X, Z)]

+

r

(n − 1)(n − 2)

[g(Y, Z)g(X, T ) − g(X, Z)g(Y, T )].

If the manifold be conformally ﬂat, then above equation implies

R(X, Y, Z, T ) =

[S(Y, Z)g(X, T ) − S(X, Z)g(Y, T )

1
2
+ S(X, T )g(Y, Z) − S(Y, T )g(X, Z)]

(3.2)

−

r
6

[g(Y, Z)g(X, T ) − g(X, Z)g(Y, T )].

4

Putting the value of Ricci tensor S from (2.8) in (3.2), we have

(3.3)

R(X, Y, Z, T ) =

r
12

[g(Y, Z)g(X, T ) − g(X, Z)g(Y, T )].

If the 3-dimensional distribution of the manifold orthogonal to ρ is denoted by ρ⊥ then
by putting Z = Y and T = X in (3.3), we can write

(3.4)

R(X, Y, Y, X) =

where X, Y ∈ ρ⊥.
Putting Y = ρ in (3.4), we have

r
12

[g(X, X)g(Y, Y ) − g(X, Y )g(X, Y )],

(3.5)

R(X, ρ, ρ, X) = −

r
12

g(X, X),

where X ∈ ρ⊥.
If we denote the sectional curvatures determined by X, Y and X, ρ by K(X, Y ) and
K(X, ρ) respectively then from (3.4) and (3.5), we have

K(X, Y ) =

R(X, Y, Y, X)

g(X, X)g(Y, Y ) − g(X, Y )g(X, Y )

=

r
12

.

K(X, ρ) =

R(X, ρ, ρ, X)

g(X, X)g(ρ, ρ) − g(X, ρ)g(X, ρ)

=

r
12

.

(3.6)

and

(3.7)

Thus we have:

Theorem 3.1. If M be a conformally ﬂat perfect ﬂuid K¨ahler space-time manifold
satisfying the Einstein equation with cosmological constant then the sectional curvature
determine by X, Y and X, ρ are same and equal to r
12 .

12 i.e. K(X, Y ) = K(X, ρ) = r

Karcher [10] has deﬁned that a Lorentzian manifold is said to be inﬁnitesimally
spatially isotropic relative to the velocity vector ﬁeld ρ if the Riemannian curvature
tensor R satisﬁes

(3.8)

and

(3.9)

R(X, Y, Z, T ) = a.[g(Y, Z)g(X, T ) − g(X, Z)g(Y, T )],

R(X, ρ, ρ, Y ) = b.g(X, Y ),

where a and b are real valued functions and X, Y, Z, T ∈ ρ⊥. Putting Y = Z = ρ in
(3.3), we get

(3.10)

R(X, ρ, ρ, T ) = −

Hence from (3.3) and (3.10), we can state:

r
12

g(X, T ).

Theorem 3.2. If M be a conformally ﬂat perfect ﬂuid K¨ahler space-time manifold
satisfying the Einstein equation with cosmological constant then the manifold is in-
ﬁnitesimally spatially isotropic relative to the velocity vector ﬁeld ρ.

4 Weakly symmetric perfect ﬂuid K¨ahler space-time

manifold

If M be a weakly symmetric K¨ahler manifold then we have

(4.1)

R(Y , Z, U, V ) = R(Y, Z, U, V ).

Taking covariant derivative of (4.1), we get easily

(4.2)

(∇X R)(Y , Z, U, V ) = (∇X R)(Y, Z, U, V ).

Using (1.3) in (4.2), we have

(4.3)

ω(Y )R(X, Z, U, V ) + ω(Z)R(Y, X, U, V ) = ω(Y )R(X, Z, U, V )

+ ω(Z)R(Y , X, U, V ).

Putting Z = U = ei, 1 ≤ i ≤ 4 in (4.3) and taking summation over i, we obtained

(4.4)

ω(Y )S(X, V ) − R(Y, X, V, ρ) = ω(Y )S(X, V ) + R(Y , X, V, ρ).

By using (2.8), equation (4.4) implies

(4.5)

r
4

ω(Y )g(X, V ) − R(Y, X, V, ρ) =

r
4

ω(Y )g(X, V ) + R(Y , X, V, ρ).

Putting X = V = ei, 1 ≤ i ≤ 4 in (4.5) and taking summation over i, we get

(4.6)

or

(4.7)

S(Y, ρ) =

r
2

ω(Y ).

S(Y, ρ) =

Replacing ρ by ρ in (4.7), we can write

(4.8)

S(Y, ρ) =

Hence from (4.7) and (4.8), we can state:

r
2

r
2

g(Y, ρ).

g(Y, ρ).

Theorem 4.1. If M be a weakly symmetric perfect ﬂuid K¨ahler space-time manifold
satisfying the Einstein equation with cosmological constant then ρ and ρ are the eigen
vector of the Ricci tensor S with respect to eigen value r
2 .

Now putting X = V = ei, 1 ≤ i ≤ 4 in (1.3) and summing over i, we have

(4.9)

(divR)(Y, Z)U =R(Y, Z, U, α) + ω(Y )S(Z, U )

+ ω(Z)S(Y, U ) + R(Y, Z, U, ρ).

From (2.8), it can be easily obtained

(4.10)

(∇Y S)(Z, U ) =

r
4

(∇Y g)(Z, U ) = 0.

6

Using (4.10) in Bianchi second identity, we can write

(4.11)

(divR)(Y, Z)U = (∇Y S)(Z, U ) − (∇Z S)(Y, U ) = 0.

By using (4.11), the equation (4.9) gives

(4.12)

R(Y, Z, U, α) + ω(Y )S(Z, U ) − ω(Z)S(Y, U ) + R(Y, Z, U, ρ) = 0.

Putting Z = U = ei, 1 ≤ i ≤ 4 in (4.12) and taking summation over i, we have

(4.13)

S(Y, α) + rω(Y ) = 0.

Using (2.8) in (4.13), we can write

(4.14)

r
4

g(Y, α) + rg(Y, ρ) = 0.

Replacing Y by ρ in (4.14), we get

(4.15)

r[g(α, ρ) − 4] = 0,

which implies either r = 0 or g(α, ρ) = 4.
Hence, from above discussion we have

Theorem 4.2. If M be a weakly symmetric perfect ﬂuid K¨ahler space-time manifold
satisfying the Einstein equation with cosmological constant then either the manifold is
of zero scalar curvature or the associated vector ﬁelds α and ρ are related by g(α, ρ) = 4.

5 Weakly Ricci symmetric perfect ﬂuid K¨ahler space-

time manifold

From equation (4.10) it is clear that if the manifold is perfect ﬂuid K¨ahler space-time
manifold then (∇X S)(Y, Z) = 0, therefore from (1.4), we have

(5.1)

A(X)S(Y, Z) + ω(Y )S(Z, X) + ω(Z)S(X, Y ) = 0,

for weakly Ricci symmetric perfect ﬂuid K¨ahler space-time manifold. Using (2.8) in
(5.1), we can write

(5.2)

r
4

[A(X)g(Y, Z) + ω(Y )g(Z, X) + ω(Z)g(X, Y )] = 0.

equation (5.2) implies either scalar curvature r = 0 or

(5.3)

A(X)g(Y, Z) + ω(Y )g(Z, X) + ω(Z)g(X, Y ) = 0.

Now, if (5.3) holds then by replacing Y and Z by Y and Z in (5.3) and using (1.6), we
get

(5.4)

A(X)g(Y, Z) + ω(Y )g(Z, X) + ω(Z)g(X, Y ) = 0.

Subtracting (5.3) from (5.4), we have

(5.5)

ω(Y )g(X, Z) − ω(Y )g(X, Z) + ω(Z)g(X, Y ) − ω(Z)g(X, Y ) = 0.

7

Putting X = Z = ei, 1 ≤ i ≤ 4 in (5.5) and taking summation over i, we get

(5.6)

ω(Y ) = 0,

which is not possible because g(ρ, ρ) = −1.
Hence, we can state that:

Theorem 5.1. There does not exist a weakly Ricci symmetric perfect ﬂuid K¨ahler
space-time manifold satisfying the Einstein equation with cosmological constant having
non-zero scalar curvature tensor.
