Abstract

It is well known that perturbative pressure calculations show poor convergence. Calculations

using a two particle irreducible (2PI) eﬀective action show improved convergence at the 3 loop

level, but no calculations have been done at 4 loops. We consider the 2PI eﬀective theory for a

symmetric scalar theory with quartic coupling in 4-dimensions. We calculate the pressure and two

diﬀerent non-perturbative vertices as functions of coupling and temperature. Our results show that

the 4 loop contribution can become larger than the 3 loop term when the coupling is large. This

indicates a breakdown of the 2PI approach, and the need for higher order nPI approximations. In

addition, our results demonstrate the renormalizability of 2PI calculations at the 4 loop level. This

is interesting because the counterterm structure of the 2PI theory at 4 loops is diﬀerent from the
structure at n ≤ 3 loops. Two vertex counterterms are required at the 4 loop level, but not at lower

loop order. This unique feature of the 2PI theory has not previously been veriﬁed numerically.

INTRODUCTION

There are many interesting systems which involve non-perturbative physics. Problems of

this kind cannot be solved by expanding in some small parameter. One possible technique

is the use of n-particle irreducible (nPI) eﬀective theories [1–3]. The basic motivation is

the hope that they can be applied to nonabelian gauge theories, but there has been little

progress to date in this direction. Calculations are complicated by issues with gauge ﬁxing

[4, 5] and renormalizability [6–9].

In this paper we work with the simplest nPI theory, which is the 2PI version (also known

as the Φ-derivable approximation). One of the ﬁrst successful uses of the 2PI theory was

a calculation of entropy in QCD [10]. It can also be used to study transport coeﬃcients in

scalar theories [11] and QED [12], and the approach to equilibrium in far from equilibrium

systems [13–18]. The gauge dependence of the QED pressure at 2 loops was studied in [19].

Phase transitions in the SU (N ) Higgs theory were studied at the 3 loop level in [20]. We

also note that other methods exist for the calculation of purely thermodynamic quantities

in non-perturbative systems. One of the most successful is screened perturbation theory,

which has been applied to scalar theories [21–24], QED [25] and QCD [26, 27].

In this paper we study an equilibrium symmetric ϕ4 theory, and work at 4 loop order in

the 2PI theory. The primary goal of this work is to study the convergence of the skeleton

expansion. Calculations were done at the 3 loop level in [28], and improved convergence

properties were found, relative to perturbative calculations. We ﬁnd that the 4 loop ap-

proximation agrees well with the 3 loop one when the coupling constant is not too large,

but as the coupling grows 4 loop contributions become important. This indicates that in

a situation where non-perturbative physics is important, higher order nPI approximations

may be needed.

In addition, our calculation is interesting because it provides numerical veriﬁcation of

the renormalizability of the 2PI theory at the 4 loop level. The renormalization of the

symmetric 2PI theory requires, in general, two diﬀerent coupling constant counterterms

which must be determined from two renormalization conditions that are imposed on diﬀerent

4-point functions [8, 9]. However, at the 2 loop and 3 loop levels the structure is much less

complicated - only one counterterm is required. Our calculation thus provides a non-trivial

check of the renormalizability of the 2PI eﬀective theory.

This paper is organized as follows. In section II we review the 2PI formalism. We describe

the numerical method in section III (more details can be found in Refs. [28–31]). In section

IV we present our results, and we conclude in section V.

II. THE 2PI EFFECTIVE THEORY

In this section we review some deﬁnitions and techniques used in 2PI calculations. In

most equations in this paper we suppress integrals and the arguments that denote the space-

time dependence of functions. As an example of this notation, the quadratic term in the

(cid:90)

action is written:

For notational convenience we use a scaled version of the physical coupling constant. The

extra factor of i will be removed when rotating to Euclidean space to do numerical calcula-

tions. The eﬀective action is obtained in the standard way. We use a BPHZ renormalization

procedure and write all expressions in terms of renormalized quantities. The eﬀective action

can be written generically as

Γ[φ, G] = Γno·int[φ, G] + Γint[φ, G] .

(3)

We deﬁne iΓ[G] = Φ[G], iΓno·int[G] = Φno·int[G] and iΓint[G] = Φint[G]. We work to order λ3

in the skeleton expansion. The non-interacting part of equation (3) is

order they appear in the equation.

In the exact theory, all counterterms of the same type are equal (for example, all vertex

counterterms are equal: δλ4 = δλtp = δλegg = δλet = δλbb). At a ﬁnite order of truncation,

the diﬀerent counterterms in equation (5) could in principle be deﬁned diﬀerently. The

In the symmetric theory the only loop diagrams that contribute are the second, fourth and

sixth terms in (6), which are shown in Fig. 2.

perturbative n point functions of the theory.

Equation (10) is a self-consistent equation for the propagator ˜G which has the structure of

a Dyson equation.

For any nPI theory one can also derive integral equations which produce non-perturbative

vertices that resum diagrams in speciﬁc channels [32, 33]. In our calculation there are two

such vertices, which we call M and V . These vertices are obtained from the self-consistent

equations

(11b)

(11c)

We comment on the physical content of equation (11), which is somewhat obscured by the

notation we are using. The vertex M , which is usually called the Bethe-Salpeter vertex,

resumms the kernel Λ in the s channel. The vertex V involves a resummation in all three

(s, t and u) channels. Using our shorthand notation which suppresses indices, the three

channels are not shown separately, but combine to produce the factor (3) in equation (11b).

The goal is to solve the self-consistent integral equations (10) and (11). It appears that
these equations are not coupled, and that we could ﬁrst solve (10) for the propagator ˜G,

and then use the result and solve (11) for the vertices M and V . In fact, we will see below

that the two integral equations are coupled, because of the counterterm structure. Once

the counterterms have been determined, the two equations decouple, and ﬁnite temperature

calculations are therefore easier.

From this point on we suppress the tilde on the self-consistent propagator and write simply

G. We work in Euclidean space. We use an obvious shorthand notation in which functional

5

dependence on four independent momentum components is represented as a single capital

letter. When the four momentum is zero, we again use only one argument. For example,
Λ(p4, p1, p2, p3, k4, k1, k2, k3) → Λ(P, K), G(0, 0, 0, 0) → G(0), etc. The equation for the
4-kernel (from (11c)) is

(cid:90)

where we have used a shorthand notation for the propagators that depend on three momenta

to save space (for example G(S + P + K) = GS+P +K). The kernel Λ contains counterterms

from the sixth and seventh diagrams in Fig. 1 (the reason they are denoted with tildes as
δ˜λ will be explained below). Note that the expression for Λ in (12) does not come directly

from (11c). The full Λ contains contributions from t and u channels which can be written as

2 times the t channel piece when the kernel is embedded in the BS equation (15), by shifting

dummy variables. This symmetrization has already been done in (12), and this is indicated
by the wiggly equal sign. The counterterm δ˜λ will be determined from the renormalization

condition

Λ(0, 0) = −λ .

We rewrite this renormalization condition as follows

Λ(P, K) = −δ˜λ + Λd(P, K) ,

δ˜λ = λ + Λd(0, 0) ,

Λ(P, K) = −λ +(cid:2)Λd(P, K) − Λd(0, 0)(cid:3) .

(13)

(14a)

(14b)

(14c)

Equation (14) is a self-consistent equation for δ˜λ, since Λd(P, K) is a function of δ˜λ (see
equation (12)). It is straightforward to show that the quantity in square brackets in equation

(14c) is ﬁnite.

The BS equation (11a) in momentum space is

M (P, 0) = −∆λ + Λ(P, 0) +

1
2

(cid:90)

dQ(cid:2) − ∆λ + Λ(P, Q)(cid:3) G2(Q) M (Q, 0) .

(15)

We note that since this equation resums only the s channel, one can ﬁx the momentum

on one side of the vertex M . The new counterterm ∆λ is an addition contribution to the

6

kernel of the BS equation from the sixth diagram in Fig. 1.

It is determined from the

renormalization condition

M (0, 0) = −λ

which, together with (14), gives a self consistent equation for ∆λ of the form

(cid:90)

∆λ =

1
2

dQ(cid:2) − ∆λ + Λ(0, Q)(cid:3) G2(Q) M (Q, 0) .

(16)

(17)

Notice that (14) and (17) are coupled, since Λ(0, Q) depends on δ˜λ. To understand the role

of the counterterm ∆λ, we imagine expanding the BS equation instead of solving it self-
consistently. The kernels Λ, which were made ﬁnite with the counterterm δ˜λ, are chained

together in the s channel. The 2PI nature of the kernels guarantees that no new divergences

are generated, except in the loops that join the kernels together. These divergences are

cancelled by the counterterm ∆λ. The vertex V in equation (11b) is ﬁnite when M and Λ

are, and therefore we can set δλ4 to zero.

Next we consider the 2-point function which is obtained from equation (10), including

counterterm diagrams of the form shown in the second, sixth and seventh parts of Fig 1.

The vertex counterterm is the sum of the two counterterms calculated above:

The resulting equations are

C. Comparision with 3 loop 2PI theory

At this point it is easy to see that calculations in the 2PI theory are considerably simpler

when the eﬀective action is truncated at the 3 loop level. The reason is that the 4-point

kernel has only a global divergence at this order. Equations (12) and (14a) give

Λd(P, K)(cid:12)(cid:12)3 loops = −λ + λ2

(cid:90)

dLG(L)G(L + P + K) ,

(23)

and from (14b) we see that the equation that determines δ˜λ is not a self-consistent equation
at 3 loop order. The result is that the two counterterms ∆λ and δ˜λ can be immediately

combined as in (18), and the BS equation can be written so that it depends on only one

coupling constant counterterm, which can be determined from (16). Schematically we have

kernel4 loops = −∆λ − δ˜λ + Λ(4)

There is an overall temperature independent divergence that can be removed by a ‘cos-

mological constant’ renormalization, which means requiring that the vacuum pressure be

zero:

∆P = Psum − Psum(T = 0) .

(34)

The arrow on the right side of (27) indicates that a temperature independent constant has

been dropped. This constant would be removed by the shift in (34) anyway. The term P0

is the non-interacting (λ = 0) pressure. We want to compare ∆P to the non-interacting

expression, so we deﬁne

P =

∆P

III. NUMERICAL METHOD

We want to solve the integral equations (12), (15), (19) and (20). The counterterms are

determined from (13), (16), (18) and (21). We use always m = 1, which means we give all

dimensionful quantities in mass units. In order to do the numerical calculation, we restrict

to a box in co-ordinate space of ﬁnite volume L3β. Fourier transforming to momentum space

one obtains discrete frequencies and momenta. This can be written

(37)

The parameters at and as are the lattice spacing in the temporal and spatial directions.
Indices which fall outside of the range {−N/2 + 1, N/2} are wrapped inside using periodic
boundary conditions.

It is well known that the scalar φ4 theory in 4-dimensions is non-interacting if it is

considered as a fundamental theory valid for arbitrarily high momentum scales (quantum

triviality), but the renormalized coupling is non-zero if the theory has an ultraviolet cutoﬀ

and an infrared regulator.

In our calculation the mass m regulates the infrared and the

lattice spacing parameter provides an ultraviolet cutoﬀ.

There are certain restrictions on the values that can be chosen for the paramters at, as,

Nt and Ns, which are discussed below. We have checked that results are independent of the

9

choices of these parameters, within these restrictions. We use lattice spacing at = as = 1/12

and in the spatial direction we use Ns = 32. The renormalization is done with Nt = 128.

We have veriﬁed numerically that the corresponding temperature gives the zero temperature

limit, and we refer to it from here on as zero temperature. Finite temperature calculations
are obtained from 126 ≥ Nt ≥ 6.

The numerical method replaces a continuous integration variable with inﬁnite limits by a

discrete sum over a ﬁnite number of terms. For numerical accuracy, we need that the upper
(cid:29) 1 and
limit of the sum is big and the step size is small. This means we require Pmax ∼ 1
(cid:28) 1. The number of lattice points N is limited by memory and computation
∆P ∼ 1
time, and therefore there is a limit on how small as can be taken while maintaining N as big.

L = 1
N as

as

However, there is another more subtle issue that limits how small we can choose as. The

theory has a Landau pole at a scale that decreases when λ increases. When λ becomes large,

as must increase (Pmax must decrease) so that the integrals are cut oﬀ in the ultraviolet at a

scale below the Landau scale. However, decreasing the ultraviolet cutoﬀ Pmax will eventually

cause important contributions from the momentum phase space to be missed. When λ has

increased to the point that the Landau scale has moved down and dipped into the momentum

regime over which the integrand is large, physically meaningful results cannot be obtained.
In our calculation we have determined that the maximum coupling we can calculate is λ ≈ 8
(using as = 1/12 and Ns = 32).

We use an iterative relaxation method to solve the self-consistent equations.

In the

equations below, an index in round brackets indicates the iteration number of a given quan-

tity. We start with the bare propagator and the BS vertex obtained from the renormalized

4-kernel:

G(0)(P ) = Gno·int(P ) =(cid:2)P 2 + m2(cid:3)−1

d (P, Q) = Λ[G(0), δ˜λ = 0]

Continuing in the same fashion, the quantities obtained from the ﬁrst iteration are used to

obtain the second iteration results. Iterations are terminated when the relative maximum

diﬀerence between the (i + 1)th iteration and the ith, for any quantity, at any point in
momentum space, is less than 10−4.

IV. RESULTS

We compare results from a truncation in the skeleton expansion at 2, 3 and 4 loops. We

will use circles (blue), diamonds (green) and boxes (red) as markers to represent truncation

at 2, 3 and 4 loops. On graphs that show both of the 4-vertices M and V , we use open

symbols for the vertex M and solid symbols for V .

V (0, 0, 0, 0) at ﬁxed temperature as a function of g =(cid:112)λ/24 (which would correspond to an

In Fig. 3 we show the zero momentum BS vertex M (0, 0, 0, 0) and symmetric vertex

11

interaction term in the Lagrangian of the form λ

24ϕ4 = g2ϕ4). Agreement is good between
all levels of truncation when g is small, as expected. The 4 loop contributions become large

as g increases.

In Fig. 4 we show the two vertices at ﬁxed λ as functions of the temperature. At zero

temperature they are renormalized to the chosen value of the coupling. Deviations between

diﬀerent orders in the approximation are evident as the temperature increases.

In Fig. 5 we show the pressure as a function of g =(cid:112)λ/24 at T = 2. The well known

oscillations that appear in the perturbative calculation are not present. However, as the

coupling grows the 4 loop result deviates increasingly from the 3 loop one.

Fig 6 demonstrates that the renormalization is done correctly. We reduce the lattice

spacing in the spatial direction (as) while holding the length of the box (L = asN ) ﬁxed.
The graph shows −V (0, 0, 0, 0) versus log(1/as) for λ = 2 and T = 1. For comparision
we show the curve that results when the renormalization is done incorrectly, using the 3

loop approximation but including an additional vertex counterterm on the 3 loop basketball

diagram. When the renormalization is done correctly, the curve is almost completely ﬂat.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

There is a hierarchial relationship between the order of the truncation and the number of

variational vertices that can be included [3]. If the eﬀective action is truncated at L loops
in the skeleton expansion, the corresponding nPI eﬀective actions are identical for n ≥ L.

within the 4PI formalism, etc, is complete. It is equivalent to say that one necessarily works
with L ≥ n. As noted in section I, several calculations have been done with the 2PI eﬀective
action at the 2 and 3 loop level. Since the introduction of higher order variational vertices is

numerically very diﬃcult, we would like to know if we can extend these previous calculations

by increasing L without simultaneously increasing n.

Unfortunately, there is evidence that an L loop calculation in the nPI formalism should,

in general, be done with L = n. In a gauge theory, it can be shown that the n loop nPI

eﬀective action respects gauge invariance, to the order of the truncation [4, 5]. In particular,

it is known that to calculate leading order transport coeﬃcients in gauge theories with an nPI

formalism, one must use the 3 loop 3PI eﬀective action [34]. In QED a 2 loop 2PI calculation

(which is complete at 2 loop order according to the hierarchial relationship discussed above)

found weak dependence on the gauge parameter [19]. A recent 3 loop 2PI calculation in

SU (N ) Higgs theory [20] has found strong dependence on the gauge parameter.

The issue of whether or not nPI calculations with L > n are useful, has not been inves-

tigated previously in scalar theories. Three loop 2PI calculations have only been done in

symmetric φ4 theory, where the symmetry prevents 3-vertices and the 3PI theory reduces to

the 2PI one. We have studied the convergence of the 2PI expansion at the 4 loop level. The

Landau pole limits our ability to study large couplings, but the accessible range of parame-

ters shows clearly that 4 loop contributions in the skeleton expansion become important at

large coupling. This kind of behaviour indicates that one should extend the calculation to

the 4PI level.

Higher order eﬀective actions can be derived using a variety of methods [3, 35–37], but

solving the resulting variational equations is extremely diﬃcult and little progress has been

made. The calculation of scalar viscosity at next-to-leading order was formulated using a

4PI eﬀective theory [38]. A scalar 4PI theory was studied in 3 dimensions in [29, 30] and

the 3PI action was used to study Yang-Mills theory in 3 dimensions in [39]. In spite of the
