ABSTRACT
The discovery of GeV gamma-rays from classical novae indicates that shocks and relativistic
particle acceleration are energetically key in these events. Further evidence for shocks comes
from thermal keV X-ray emission and an early peak in the radio light curve on a timescale
of months with a brightness temperature which is too high to result from freely expanding
photo-ionized gas. Paper I developed a one dimensional model for the thermal emission from
nova shocks. This work concluded that the shock-powered radio peak cannot be thermal if
line cooling operates in the post-shock gas at the rate determined by collisional ionization
equilibrium. Here we extend this calculation to include non-thermal synchrotron emission.
Applying our model to three classical novae, we constrain the ampliﬁcation of the magnetic
ﬁeld B and the eﬃciency e of accelerating relativistic electrons of characteristic Lorentz
factor γ ∼ 100. If the shocks are radiative (low velocity vsh ∼< 1000 km s−1) and cover a
large solid angle of the nova outﬂow, as likely characterize those producing gamma-rays, then
values of e ∼ 0.01− 0.1 are required to achieve the peak radio brightness for B = 10−2. Such
high eﬃciencies exclude secondary pairs from pion decay as the source of the radio-emitting
particles, instead favoring the direct acceleration of electrons at the shock. If the radio-emitting
shocks are instead adiabatic (high velocity), as likely characterize those responsible for the
thermal X-rays, then much higher brightness temperatures are possible, allowing the radio-
emitting shocks to cover a smaller outﬂow solid angle.
Key words: binaries: classical novae, shocks, particle acceleration

INTRODUCTION

Classical and symbiotic novae are luminous transients, powered
by runaway thermonuclear burning within a hydrogen-rich layer
which has been accreted from a companion binary star (e.g., Gal-
lagher & Starrﬁeld 1978; Starrﬁeld et al. 2000; Yaron et al. 2005;
Townsley & Bildsten 2005; Casanova et al. 2011). Energy from nu-
clear burning causes the white dwarf atmosphere to inﬂate, leading
to the ejection of ∼ 10−5 − 10−4 M(cid:12) of CNO-enriched matter at
velocities of hundreds to thousands of kilometers per second (e.g.,
Seaquist et al. 1980; Shore 2012).

One interpretation of radio and optical imaging (Chomiuk
et al. 2014; Schaefer et al. 2014), and optical spectroscopy (Ribeiro
et al. 2013; Shore et al. 2013), is that the nova outburst proceeds in
at least in two stages (Figure 1). The runaway is ﬁrst accompanied
by the ejection of matter at relatively low velocities in an outﬂow
concentrated in the equatorial plane of the binary. The geometry of
this slow outﬂow may be inﬂuenced by the gravity of the compan-
ion star, as occurs in common envelope phases of stellar evolution
(e.g., Livio et al. 1990; Lloyd et al. 1997). Given the uncertain na-

ture of the slow ejecta, we use the agnostic term ‘dense external
shell’ (DES; Metzger et al. 2014).

The outﬂowing DES is then followed by a more continuous
wind (e.g., Bath & Shaviv 1976) with a higher velocity and a more
spherical geometry. A subsequent collision between this fast out-
ﬂow and the slower DES results in strong internal shocks, which
are most powerful near the equatorial plane where the density con-
trast is largest. If the fast component expands relatively unimpeded
along the polar direction, this may create a bipolar morphology
(Chomiuk et al. 2014; Metzger et al. 2015). This scenario does not
exclude the presence of fast shocks within the polar region, which
are characterized by lower densities and could produce hard X-ray
emission (see below; Fig. 1).

Several lines of evidence across the electromagnetic spectrum
support shocks being common features of nova outbursts. Nova op-
tical spectra exhibit complex absorption lines with multiple veloc-
ity components (e.g., Friedjung & Duerbeck 1993; Williams et al.
2008; Williams & Mason 2010). In addition to broad P Cygni
lines indicating high velocity ∼> 1000 km s−1 matter, narrower ab-
sorption features (≈ 500 − 900 km s−1) are observed near opti-
cal maximum and may be created within the DES. A large frac-
tion of novae show such narrow lines. This indicates that the ab-
sorbing material−whatever its nature−has a high covering fraction

Figure 1. Proposed scenario for the locations of X-ray and radio emitting
shocks (see Introduction and §2.3). A slow outﬂow is ejected ﬁrst, its ge-
ometry shaped into an equatorially-concentrated torus (blue). This is fol-
lowed by a faster outﬂow or continuous wind with a higher velocity and
more spherical geometry (red). The fast and slow components collide in
the equatorial plane, producing powerful radiative shocks (Fig. 2) which
are responsible for the gamma-ray emission on timescales of weeks and the
non-thermal radio emission on a timescale of months. Adiabatic internal
shocks within the fast, low density polar outﬂow power hard (cid:29) keV ther-
mal X-rays and possibly radio emission at very early times. Slower equa-
torial shocks produce the non-thermal radio peak on a timescale of months
and softer X-rays (kT ∼< keV), which may be challenging to detect due to
their lower luminosity and possible confusion with supersoft X-rays from
the white dwarf.

(Williams & Mason 2010) and hence is likely to undergo a collision
with the faster P Cygni outﬂow. The high densities, temperatures,
and ionizing radiation produced by shocks can also impact the op-
tical line spectra (e.g. Shields & Ferland 1978; Contini & Prialnik
1997).
Many novae are accompanied by thermal X-ray emission with
luminosities LX ∼ 1033− 1035 erg s−1 and temperatures ∼> keV (e.g.,
Lloyd et al. 1992; O’Brien et al. 1994; Orio 2004; Sokoloski et al.
2006; Ness et al. 2007; Mukai et al. 2008; Schwarz et al. 2011;
Krauss et al. 2011; Chomiuk et al. 2014; see Osborne 2015 for a
recent summary of Swift observations). This emission is too hard
to be thermal radiation from the white dwarf surface (Wolf et al.
2013), but the keV X-rays are readily explained as free-free emis-
son from ∼> 1000 km s−1 shocks (e.g. Mukai & Ishida 2001). In
many cases the X-ray emission is delayed by weeks or longer after
the optical maximum, possibly due to bound-free absorption by the
DES (Metzger et al. 2014).

Although the presence of shocks in novae has been appreci-
ated for some time, their energetic importance was only recently
revealed by the Fermi LAT discovery of ∼> 100 MeV gamma-rays,
which are observed to be coincident within a few days of the opti-
cal peak and last for a few weeks (Ackermann et al. 2014). Previous
models predicted MeV gamma-rays due to nuclear lines and Comp-
ton down-scattering of gamma-rays from electron-positron annihi-
lation (see Hernanz 2014 for a review). However, the continuum
GeV gamma-rays observed can only be understood as the result of

particle acceleration in shocks (Tatischeﬀ & Hernanz 2007; Martin
& Dubus 2013; Ackermann et al. 2014; Metzger et al. 2015, 2016).
Gamma-rays were ﬁrst detected in the symbiotic nova V407
Cyg 2010, in which the target material for the shocks could be un-
derstood as the dense wind of the companion red giant (Abdo et al.
2010; Vaytet et al. 2011; Martin & Dubus 2013). However, six ad-
ditional novae have now been detected by Fermi-LAT, at least four
of which show no evidence for a giant companion and hence were
likely ordinary classical novae with main sequence companions.
This demonstrates that a DES is present even in binary systems
that are not embedded in the wind of an M giant or associated with
recurrent novae, supporting the internal shock scenario described
above.
The high gamma-ray luminosities Lγ ∼ 1035 − 1036 erg s−1
require shocks with kinetic powers which are at least two orders
of magnitude larger, i.e. Lsh ∼ 1037 − 1038 erg s−1, approaching
the bolometric output of the nova (Metzger et al. 2015). Gamma-
rays are produced by the decay of neutral pions created by colli-
sions between relativistic protons and ambient protons in the ejecta
(hadronic scenario), or by inverse Compton or bremsstrahlung
emission from relativistic electrons (leptonic scenario). Hadronic
versus lepton emission scenarios cannot be distinguished based
on the gamma-ray spectra alone (Ackermann et al. 2014). Met-
zger et al. (2015) favor the hadronic scenario, due to the high ef-
ﬁciency of non-thermal particle acceleration they infer. Other non-
relativistic shocks, such as supernova remnants, typically place at
least 10-100 times more energy into relativistic protons than into
relativistic electrons (e.g. Strong et al. 2010), making hadronic
models more economical than leptonic ones as the source of nova
gamma-rays.

Additional evidence for shocks comes at radio wavelengths.
It has long been known that novae produce thermal radio emis-
sion from the freely expanding photoionized ejecta of temperature
∼ 104 K, which peaks as the ejecta becomes optically thin to free-
free absorption roughly a year after the optical outburst (Seaquist
& Bode 2008). However, a growing sample of novae show an ad-
ditional peak in the radio emission at earlier times (∼< 100 days;
Taylor et al. 1987; Krauss et al. 2011; Chomiuk et al. 2014; We-
ston et al. 2015,?; Fig. 4) with brightness temperatures 105 − 106
K higher than that of photo-ionized gas. This additional early radio
peak requires sudden heating of the ejecta (e.g., Lloyd et al. 1996;
Metzger et al. 2014) or non-thermal emission (Taylor et al. 1987;
Weston et al. 2015), in either case implicating shocks.

Not all of the above-mentioned signatures of shocks (γ-rays,
hard X-rays, early radio peak) are present in all novae (Table 3).
V1324 Sco was detected γ-rays and possessed an early shock-
powered radio peak, but was not detected in X-rays. V1723 Aql
and V5589 Sgr showed early radio peaks and hard X-ray emis-
sion, but no γ-ray detection (V5589 Sgr also showed no obvious
thermal radio peak). V339 Del and V959 Mon have γ-ray emis-
sion, hard X-ray emission, but no early radio peak. The primary
cause of this diversity, be it intrinsic to the nova eruption, a re-
sult of viewing angle, or an observational selection eﬀect, remains
an important open question. Ultimately these must be addressed
by combining multi-dimensional models for the nova eruption, in-
cluding the subtle inﬂuence of the binary companion on the outﬂow
mass loss rate and geometry, with models for the multi-wavelength
shock-powered emission.

Metzger et al. (2014) (Paper I) developed a one-dimensional
model for the forward-reverse shock structure in novae and its re-
sulting thermal X-ray, optical, radio emission. This initial work
provided an acceptable ﬁt to the radio light curves of the gamma-
c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

ray nova V1324 Sco, under the assumption that the dominant cool-
ing behind the shock was provided by free-free emission. However,
for low velocity shocks ∼< 103 km s−1 line cooling of the CNO-
enriched gas can greatly exceed free-free cooling. For cooling rates
determined by collisional ionization equlibrium (CIE), this addi-
tional cooling reduces the peak brightness temperature of thermal
models to values ∼< 104 K, which are too low to explain the early
radio peak, unless line cooling is suppressed by non-LTE eﬀects.
This work (Paper II) extends our model for nova shocks to in-
clude non-thermal synchrotron radio emission, which we demon-
strate can more readily explain the observed emission, even for low
shock velocities. In addition to providing information on the struc-
ture of the ejecta and the nova outburst mechanism, synchrotron
emission provides an alternative probe of relativistic particle accel-
eration in these events, complementary to that obtained from the
gamma-ray band. In leptonic scenarios, relativistic electrons accel-
erated directly at the shock power both the radio and gamma-ray
emission. Radio-emitting e± pairs are also produced in hadronic
scenarios by the decay of the charged pions. As these two processes
make diﬀerent predictions for the electron acceleration eﬃciency,
radio observations can in principle help disentangle leptonic from
hadronic models.
This paper is organized as follows. We begin with an overview
of shocks in novae (§2), including the collision dynamics, observa-
tional evidence for shocks, the analytic condition for radio maxi-
mum, the radiative versus adiabatic nature of the shock, and ther-
mal X-ray emission. In §3 we describe key features of synchrotron
emission, including leptonic and hadronic sources of non-thermal
particles and their cooling. In §4 we provide a detailed descrip-
tion of our model for radio emission from the forward shock. In §5
we describe our results, including analytic estimates for brightness
temperature, and ﬁts to the radio lightcurves of three novae: V1324
Sco, V1723 Aql, and V5589 Sgr. In the discussion (§6) we use the
radio observations to constrain the acceleration eﬃciency of rela-
tivistic particles and magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation in the shocks and
their connection to gamma-ray emission. We also discuss outstand-
ing issues, including the unexpectedly monochromatic light curve
of V1723 Aql and the role of adiabatic X-ray producing shocks. In
§7 we summarize our conclusions.

2 SHOCKS IN NOVAE

Following Metzger et al. (2014), we consider the collision between
a fast outﬂow from the white dwarf of velocity v1 and the DES of
velocity v4 < v1 and unshocked density n4, as shown in Figure 2.
We assume that the DES of velocity v4 is ejected at t = 0, corre-
sponding to the time of the ﬁrst optical detection. The fast outﬂow
of velocity v1 is ejected after a delay of time ∆t. The fast outﬂow
and DES collide at a radius and time given, respectively, by

the slower dense external shell [DES] (Region 4). A forward shock is driven
into the DES, while the reverse shock is driven back into the fast ejecta. The
shocked ejecta (Region 2) and shocked DES (Region 3) are separated by a
cold central shell containing the swept up mass. Observed radio emission

spherical symmetry and, for the time being, that the shocks are ra-
diative (the cooling time of the post-shock gas is short compared to
the expansion rate; §2.3). For radiative shocks the post shock mate-
rial is compressed and piles up in a central cold shell sandwiched by
the ram pressure of the two shocks. Neglecting non-thermal pres-
sure, the shocked gas cools by a factor of ∼ 103, its volume becom-
ing negligible. Hence the shocks propagate outwards at the same
velocity as the central shell, vshell = vshock ≡ vsh. The velocity of the
cold central shell is determined by equating the rate of momentum
deposition from ahead and from behind (Metzger et al. 2014),
n1(v1 − vsh)2 = n4(vsh − v4)2,

solar chemical composition with enhanced abundances as follows:

[Fe/H]=0.7, typical of nova ejecta (e.g., Schwarz et al. 2007),
which corresponds to µ = 0.76. However, our qualitative results
are not sensitive to the precise abundances we have assumed.

the forward shock is neutral due to the short timescale for radiative
recombination (e.g., Metzger et al. 2014). The upstream is however
subject to ionizing UV and X-ray radiation from the shock, which
penetrates gas ahead of the shock to a depth, ∆ion, which is set by
the balance between photo-ionization and recombination, similar
to an HII region (Metzger et al. 2014; Fig. 2). The thickness of this
ionized “precursor” layer plays a key role in our model because its
optical depth to free-free emission sets the peak timescale and ﬂux
of the radio emission (§2.2).

is obtained in the limit that free-free emission is the sole source of
ionization, where Ryd = 13.6 eV. However, fEUV can in principle

greatly exceed this minimum due to line emission and from the
reprocessing of higher-energy photons to lower frequencies by the
neutral gas ahead of the shock or in the central shell.1

2.1 Evidence for Non-Thermal Radio Emission

Figure 3 shows the radio light curves of three novae with clear
early-time shock signatures: V1324 Sco (Finzell et al. 2015),
V1723 Aql (Krauss et al. 2011; Weston et al. 2015), and V5589
Sgr (Weston et al. 2015). Thermal free-free emission from the
photo-ionized nova ejecta peaks roughly a year after the outburst
(Seaquist & Bode 2008). However, in V1324 Sco and V1723 Aql,
the light curve also shows a second, earlier peak on a characteristic
timescale of a few months. This early peak is also present in V5589
Sgr, although the late thermal peak in this event is only observed at
higher radio frequencies (Weston et al. 2015).

1 Ionizing X-rays from the white dwarf are likely blocked by the neutral
central shell in the equatorial plane, although they may escape along the
low density polar region (Fig. 1). Many novae are not detected as supersoft
X-ray sources until after the early shock-powered radio emission has peaked
(Schwarz et al. 2011).

of the radio lightcurve near its maximum depends on the density
proﬁle of the ejecta, which we take to be that of homologous expan-
sion, n ∝ t−1r−2, the so-called ‘Hubble ﬂow’ model. Finally, after
the entire ejecta becomes optically thin, the spectrum approaches
that of optically thin free-free emission, Fν ∝ ν−0.1t−3.

In order to isolate the non-thermal, shock-powered contribu-
tion to the radio emission, we ﬁrst remove the thermal emission
from the photo-ionized ejecta. We ﬁt the late thermal emission for
V1324 Sco and V1723 Aql using the standard method outlined
in Bode & Evans (2008). Our best-ﬁt parameters for the ejecta
mass of Mej ≈ 2 − 3 × 10−4M(cid:12) and maximum ejecta velocities of
vmax ≈ 1300− 1600 km s−1 are compiled in Table 2. After subtract-
ing the thermal component from the raw ﬂuxes (Fig. 3), the remain-
der should in principle contain only the shock-powered emission.
Figure 4 shows the brightness temperature Tb of the early
shock-powered radio emission, which we have calculated assum-
ing that the shock-powered emission covers the entire solid angle of
the outﬂow and originates from a radius equal to that of the fastest
ejecta inferred from the thermal ﬁt, R = vmaxt. The brightness tem-
perature peaks at values ∼ 105 − 106 K which greatly exceed the
temperature ∼ 104 K of the photo-ionized ejecta observed at late
times (Weston et al. 2015). Note also that Tb peaks at greater val-
ues at lower frequencies.

cies with full time coverage are shown. In V1324 Sco and V1723 Aql, we
show for comparison our best-ﬁt thermal models (Table 2). In V5589 Sgr
we do not attempt to ﬁt a thermal model, even though some of the emission
after day 100 could in principle be thermal.

Thermal emission from an expanding sphere is initially char-
acterized by an optically thick Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum Fν ∝ ν2
and a total ﬂux that increases with time in proportional to the sur-
face area ∝ R2 ∝ t2. Then, starting at high frequencies, the ejecta
begins to become optically thin and the radio lightcurve decays as

We model the outer layers of the DES, through which the for-
ward shock is propagating at time t, with an exponential density
proﬁle,
n4 = n0 exp[−˜v f (t − t0)/H],
where n0 is a ﬁducial density of the DES at the time t0 of the col-
lision (eq. [1]) and H is the density scaleheight. The radio light
curves in V1324 Sco and V5589 Sgr exhibit a rapid post-maximum
decline on a timescale of tfall ∼ weeks which is much less than the
timescale of the collision ∼ t0 (Fig. 3). This suggests that the for-
ward shock is propagating down a density proﬁle with a steep radial
gradient,
H ∼ ˜v f tfall ≈ 6 × 1013v8
(10)
which is much smaller than the shock radius R0 ∼ 1015 cm (eq. [1]).
As discussed below, the rise time of the early non-thermal
emission is controlled by the free-free optical depth, which de-
creases from a value (cid:29) 1 to (cid:28) 1 as the density ahead of the
shock declines. The post-maximum decay of the light curve is not
aﬀected by absorption and hence is determined more directly by
the declining density. The predicted light curve is largely insensi-
tive to the density normalization n0 adopted in equation (9) as long
as it greatly exceeds the density at the time of the radio peak npk
described below.

2.2 Condition for Radio Maximum

Gamma-rays are detected beginning within days of the optical max-
imum (Ackermann et al. 2014), showing that shocks are present
even during early phases of the nova eruption. However, at these

early times when the density of the shocked matter is highest, radio
emission from the shocks is strongly absorbed by the photo-ionized
gas ahead of the shock.
The observed brightness temperature, Tb, is related to the un-
screened value just ahead of the shock surface, Tν|shock, according
to (Metzger et al. 2014)
Tb = Tν|shocke−τﬀ,4 + (1 − e−τﬀ,4)T4,
where

τﬀ,4 = αﬀ,4∆ion
is the free-free optical depth of the ionized layer ahead of the shock
of thickness ∆ion (eq. [7]) and
αﬀ,4 ≈ α0 ν
is the free-free absorption coeﬃcient (Rybicki & Lightman 1979),
where T4 ≈ 2× 104 K is the temperature in the photo-ionized layer.
For the conditions in pre-shock photo-ionized layer, the pre-factor
takes on the value α0 = 0.1 cm5 K−3/2.
Thus, although the unscreened ﬂux Tν is initially large, the
observed emission is suppressed by a factor of e−τﬀ,4 (cid:28) 1 at
these early times. The shock-powered radio emission at frequency
ν peaks once the shock propagates down the density gradient of the
DES to the point that (Metzger et al. 2014)
τﬀ,4(ν) = αﬀ,4(ν) ∆ion ∼ 1.

The dependency of npk ∝ νq on frequency ν (where q = 1 − 2)
illustrates that light curves peak at diﬀerent frequencies with a de-
lay that is typically of order the rise time. More precisely, by com-
bining the density proﬁle (eq. [9]) with equation (15), we obtain the
delay between the maximum radio ﬂux at frequencies ν2 and ν1,

collision, ¯n0 (eq. [2]). They are also several orders of magnitude
lower than the densities required to produce the observed γ-ray lu-
minosities (Metzger et al. 2015), consistent with the radio emission
peaking well after the γ-ray emission is no longer detectable. We
now consider basic properties of the forward shock at the times of
radio maximum, deﬁned by the condition n4 = npk.

2.3

Is the Forward Shock Radiative or Adiabatic?

Whether the shock is radiative or adiabatic near the peak of the
radio light curve depends on the cooling timescale of the post-shock
gas,

tcool =

(17)

where n3,pk = 4npk is the density of the post-shock gas at the time
of the radio peak (eq. [15]) and

(19)

is the cooling function. The latter receives contributions from emis-
sion lines, Λlines, and from free-free emission
Λﬀ ≈ 3 × 10−27(T/K)1/2 erg cm3 s−1.
Figure 9 shows the tabulated cooling function from Schure et al.

mation to the line cooling rate,
Λlines ≈ 10−22Λc,−22
(20)
with Λc,−22 = 1.5, δ = −0.7. The cooling rate is signiﬁcantly larger
than for solar metallicity gas due to the large enhancements of CNO
elements.

The ratio of the cooling timescale (eq. [17]) at the time of

where in the ﬁnal equality we have used equations (6), (15). Ra-
diative shocks (tcool (cid:28) tfall) and adiabatic shocks (tcool (cid:29) tfall) are
divided sharply at v8 ≈ 1, because tcool/tfall is a very sensitive func-
tion of the shock velocity. Note that η also equals the ratio of the
post-shock cooling length

Lcool = ˜v f tcool = η3H

(22)

to the scale-height, such that the condition for radiative shocks
(η3 (cid:28) 1) can also be written as Lcool (cid:28) H.

In radiative shocks the cooling time is shorter than expansion
time. Only the immediate post-shock material is hot and contributes
to the emission, allowing for faster light curve evolution. The rapid
post-maximum decline in V1324 Sco, and V5589 Sgr (tfall (cid:28) t)
is consistent with radiative shocks in these systems (Metzger et al.
2014). By contrast, because in adiabatic shocks the cooling time is
by deﬁnition longer than the expansion time, radio emission orig-
inates not only from matter which has just been shocked, but also
that shocked several expansion times prior. If the thickness of the
ejecta shell is comparable to its radius, then the emission from the
adiabatic shock will evolve on the expansion time ∼ t, i.e. slower

than the observed decays. The observed rapid evolution of the ra-
dio light does not, however, exclude adiabatic shocks if they occur
between thin (thickness (cid:28) Rej), low density shells (§6.3.2).

2.4 Thermal X-ray Emission

Thermal X-rays are diagnostic of the shock velocity and hence of
their adiabatic versus radiative nature. Figure 5 shows the X-ray
light curve and temperature evolution for V5589 Sgr (Weston et al.
2015). The luminosity peaks at LX ∼ 1034 erg s−1 a few weeks after
the optical outburst, decreasing to LX ∼ 3 × 1033 erg s−1 around the
time of the ﬁrst radio peak near day 50. The temperature is very
high kT ∼> 30 keV initially, decreasing to ∼ 1 keV by the radio
peak. The large velocities v8 (cid:29) 1 required to produce the high
X-ray temperatures observed at the earliest times clearly implicate
adiabatic shocks. However, as we now discuss, the X-ray and radio
emission may not originate from the same shocks. Furthermore,
the same shocks may not be responsible for the X-ray and radio
emission at all times.

The X-ray luminosity of the forward shock is given by (Met-

X-ray emission can be attenuated by bound-free absorption.
For our adopted composition we ﬁnd that the bound-free opacity is
reasonably approximated as κ ≈ 2000(EX/keV)−2 cm2 g−1 across
the range of X-ray energies EX of interest (Verner et al. 1996). The
X-ray optical depth at the energies corresponding to the peak of the
free-free emission (EX = kT3 ≈ 1.4v2

Analagous to the radio light curve, the X-ray luminosity from the
shock propagating down a density gradient peaks at τX ∼ 1. This
occurs once the density of the pre-shock gas decreases to a value of
nX ≈ 6 × 106H−1
14 v4
(25)
For v8 ∼ 1 the radio and X-ray light curves coincidentally peak
at a similar density, i.e., nX ∼ npk. The X-rays peak signiﬁcantly
earlier(later) than the radio for v8 ∼> 1 (v8 ∼< 1), respectively.
Figure 6 shows the maximum X-ray luminosity as a function
of the shock velocity, obtained by combining nX with equation (23)
for fΩ = 1 and a ﬁducial shock radius of Rsh ∼ 1015 cm. This is
the maximum value because it is calculated assuming that the den-
sity of the shocked matter equals or exceeds nX. This assumption
becomes less realistic for the highest shock velocities because the
density required to achieve τX ∼> 1 becomes unphysically high.
The predicted X-ray luminosity for v8 ∼> 1 is several orders
of magnitude greater than the observed range in classical novae,
LX ∼ 1033 − 1035 erg s−1 (Mukai & Ishida 2001; Mukai et al. 2008;
Osborne 2015; see Table 3). This indicates that either the X-ray
producing shocks (a) cover a small fraction of the outﬂow solid
angle fΩ ∼ 0.01− 0.1, or (b) are produced in regions of the outﬂow
with much lower densities, n (cid:28) nX, than the mean value ¯n ∼ 107 −
109 cm−3 (eq. [2]). This is because if ¯n (cid:28) nX then the black line in
Figure 6 overestimates the peak X-ray luminosity.

triangles indicate temperature lower limits.

Condition (b) is challenging to satisfy at early times when the
ejecta density is highest. Conditions (a) and (b) are also at odds with
the high covering fractions fΩ ∼ 1 and high shock densities needed
to power the gamma-ray luminosities (Metzger et al. 2015). We
instead postulate that, at least at the earliest times, the hard (cid:29) keV
X-ray emission does not originate from the same shocks reponsible
for the gamma-ray and non-thermal radio peak, but instead from
the low density polar region (Fig. 1).

By contrast, the early radio peak could be powered either by
the same fast polar shocks or by lower velocity (v8 ∼< 1) radiative
shocks in the higher density equatorial region (Fig. 1). In the latter
case, the radio-producing shocks still produce their own thermal
X-rays. However, being potentially comparable in brightness, yet
softer in energy, to that from the faster shocks, X-rays from the
slower equatorial shocks may not always be readily observable. For
such a picture to hold, radio emission from the hypothesized fast X-
ray producing adiabatic shocks must be subdominant to that of the
slow component. We return to this issue in §6.4 after developing
the radio emission model.

3 SYNCHROTRON RADIO EMISSION

Ampliﬁcation of the magnetic ﬁeld is required to produce the ob-
served synchrotron emission. Such ampliﬁcation is expected near
the shock due to instabilities driven by cosmic ray currents pene-
trating the upstream region (e.g. Bell 2004; Caprioli & Spitkovsky
2014b). The strength of the post shock magnetic ﬁeld can be esti-
mated as
Bsh = (24πP3B)1/2 ≈ 0.22n1/2
(26)
where n4,7 ≡ n4/107 cm−3, B = 10−2B,−2 is the fraction of the
post-shock energy density in the magnetic ﬁeld.
Substituting n4 = npk ≈ npk,∆ (eq. [15]) into equation (26)
gives the ﬁeld strength at the time when the radio emission at fre-
quency ν reaches its peak value,

3.1 Leptonic Emission

The relativistic leptons responsible for synchrotron radiation can
originate either from the direct shock acceleration of electrons, or
from electron-positron pairs produced by the decay of charged pi-
ons from inelastic proton-proton collisions.

Diﬀusive Shock Acceleration occurs when charged particles
are accelerated to energies exceeding that of the thermal plasma by
diﬀusing back and forth across the shock front via interaction with
magnetic turbulence upstream and downstream (e.g., Blandford &
Ostriker 1978). Both theory and simulations predict the spectrum
of accelerated electrons (dN/dE)dE ∝ E−pdE, with p ∼> 2 (when
E (cid:29) mec2) in the case of strong shocks (Figure 10, top panel).
Two key parameters relevant to modeling the non-thermal shock
emission are the fractions of the shock kinetic power placed into
non-thermal electrons and ions: e and p, respectively.

2 The ‘Razin’ eﬀect suppresses synchrotron radiation below a critical fre-
quency νR = νpγ (Rybicki & Lightman 1979), where νp = (npke2/πme)1/2.
For γ = γpk we thus have ν/νR = 4.5 1/4

of interest we have ν ∼> νR, modiﬁcations from the Razin eﬀect should be

Wolﬀ & Tautz 2015, Caprioli & Spitkovsky 2014a, Caprioli &
Spitkovsky 2014b, Caprioli & Spitkovsky 2014c, Kato 2014, Park
et al. 2014) indicate that the values of e and p depend on the Mach
number of the shock, and the strength and the inclination angle θ
of the upstream magnetic ﬁeld with respect to the shock normal.
Shocks which propagate nearly perpendicular to the direction of
the magnetic ﬁeld (θ ≈ 90◦; “quasi-perpendicular”) do not appear
to be eﬃcient at accelerating protons or electrons (Riquelme &
Spitkovsky 2011). Shocks which propagate nearly parallel to the
magnetic ﬁeld (θ ≈ 0◦; “quasi-parallel”) accelerate both protons
and electrons (Kato 2014; Park et al. 2014).

What magnetic ﬁeld geometry do we expect in the ejecta?
When the radio emission is peaking on a timescale of months, the
nova ejecta has expanded several orders from its initial size at the
base of the outﬂow (Metzger et al. 2015). This expansion dilutes the
overall strength of the magnetic ﬁeld via ﬂux freezing and stretches
its geometry to be perpendicular to the radial direction in which the
shocks are propagating. Although this appears to disfavor hadronic
scenarios, leptonic scenarios are also strained. Metzger et al. (2015)
found that values of e ∼> 10−2 were required to explain the γ-ray
emission in V1324 Sco in leptonic scenarios. This is much higher
than the electron acceleration eﬃciencies inferred from numerical
simulations of non-relativistic shocks (Kato 2014, Park et al. 2014).
If the shocks are not quasi-perpendicular everywhere, e.g. due
to global asymmetries, or local inhomogeneities in the shocked gas
caused by radiative instabilities (Metzger et al. 2015), then hadronic
acceleration could still operate across a fraction of the shock sur-
face. This motivates considering alternative, hadronic sources for
the radio-emitting leptons.

3.2 Hadronic Emission

Relativistic protons accelerated near the shock collide with thermal
protons in the upstream or downstream regions, producing neutral
(π0) and charged (π−, π+) pions. Neutral pions decay directly into
γ−rays, while π± decay into neutrinos and muons, which in turn
decay into relativistic e± pairs and neutrinos. In addition to elec-
trons accelerated directly at the shock, these secondary pairs could
contribute to the observed radio emission.
Figure 10 shows the e± spectrum produced from pion decay,
calculated for a ﬂat input proton energy spectrum (p = 2). Syn-
chrotron radio emission near the time of peak ﬂux is produced
by electrons of energy γpkmec2 ≈ 100 MeV, where γpk ≈ 200
(§3; eq. [29]). By coincidence, this is close to the pion rest en-
ergy mπc2 ≈ 140 MeV and hence to the peak of the e± distribution
produce by pion decay. Thus, secondary pairs can contribute sig-
niﬁcantly to the radio emission if they are deposited in the right
locations.

Pion-producing collisions occur both ahead of the shock and
in the post-shock cooling layer. However, pairs produced in the cold
central shell cannot contribute to the radio emission due to the high
free-free optical depth in this region (see Fig. 8). This means that
only pions produced in the immediate post shock cooling layer con-
tribute to the observable radio emission. The timescale for a rela-
tivistic proton to produce a pion, tπ = (n3σπc)−1, is long compared
to the ﬂow time through the post-shock cooling layer, tcool,

downstream? Proton acceleration via DSA is conﬁned to the nar-
row photo-ionized region ahead of the shock, the radial thickness
of which, ∆ion, is the limiting factor setting the maximum proton
energy Emax ∼GeV−TeV (Metzger et al. 2016). However, protons
of energy ∼ Emax leak out of the DSA cycle, escaping into the
upstream with a nearly mono-energetic distribution with a com-
parable energy ﬂux to the power-law spectrum ultimately advected
downstream (e.g. Caprioli & Spitkovsky 2014a). Since the energy
ﬂux of these highest energy protons is comparable to the energy
ﬂux of power-law protons advected downstream, these two popu-
lations place roughly the same total energy into electrons. How-
ever, the upstream-stream protons inject pairs at multi-GeV ener-
gies (cid:29) γpkmec2 (eq. [29]) which radiate most of their synchrotron
emission at higher frequencies than that responsible for the bulk
of the radio emission. Pairs created in the post-shock downstream
will thus likely dominate the production of radio-emitting leptons
in hadronic scenarios, with an “eﬀective” electron acceleration ef-
ﬁciency given by equation (31).

3.3 Non-Thermal Electron Cooling in the Post-Shock Region
In deriving the shock radio emission in §4 we will assume that rela-
tivistic e± pairs evolve adiabatically in the post-shock cooling layer.
We justify this assumption here by comparing various sources of
cooling (Coulomb, bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton) to that of
the background thermal plasma, tcool (eq. [17]). We again focus on
electrons or positrons with Lorentz factors of γpk ∼ 200 (eq. [29]),
as these determine the synchrotron ﬂux near the light curve peak,
where n3 = 4n4 = 4npk.

First note that thermal electrons and protons are well coupled
behind the shock by Coulomb collisions and thus share a common
temperature. At radio maximum (n4 = npk,∆) the Coulomb equi-
libriation timescale for the thermal plasma, te−p = 3.5T 3/2

In summary, relativistic radio-emitting leptons cool in the
post-shock gas on a timescale which is generally much longer than
that of the thermal background plasma for the range of veloci-
ties v8 ∼< 1 of radiative shocks. This justiﬁes evolving their en-
ergies adiabatically behind the shock, with the possible exception
of Coulomb losses, which are unimportant immediately behind the
shock but may become so as gas compresses to higher densities

4 RADIO EMISSION MODEL
4.1 Pressure Evolution of the Post-Shock Gas

Gas compresses behind the shock due to radiative cooling at ap-
proximately constant pressure. We neglect the impact of thermal
instability of radiative shocks (e.g., Chevalier & Imamura 1982),
which may complicate this assumption. The total pressure includes
both the thermal gas and relativistic ions (‘cosmic rays’),

Figure 7 compares the post shock compression n/n3 at con-
stant Ptot as a function of temperature T/T3 for p = 0.2 to the
equivalent case with zero non-thermal pressure (p = 0). With-
out the eﬀects of non-thermal pressure, the density evolves as
n = n3(T3/T), reaching a ﬁnal value at the central shell of tem-
perature T ∼ 104 K which is a factor of ∼ 100 times higher than
the pre-shock density. However, when p (cid:44) 0 then gas compression
is halted prematurely at a maximum density of nmax (cid:39) n3(p/2)−3/4.
In subsequent numerical calculations we assume p = 0.2, although
our results are not particularly sensitive to this assumption because

electrons.

most of the emission originates from the ﬁrst cooling length behind
the shock, i.e. before compression eﬀects become important.

4.2 Electron and Positron Spectra

The energy spectrum of electrons and positrons, N(E), are normal-
ized such that a fraction e of total shock power is placed into rela-
tivistic electrons. In the leptonic scenario, we assume that
N(E)= CEE−p, Emin < E < Emax
(39)
where E = γmec2, Emin = 2mec2 ≈ 106 eV and Emax = 1012 eV.
The latter value is characteristic of the maximum particle energy
achieved in nova shocks (Metzger et al. 2016), but our results are
not sensitive to this choice for p ≥ 2. The normalization constant
CE is given by

where the term ∝ (n/n3)(p+2)/3 accounts for adiabatic heating as gas

Based on our estimates in §3.3, most sources of electron cool-
ing in the post shock gas are negligible, with the possible exception
of Coulomb losses. The latter is taken into account by exploiting
the fact that the Coulomb energy loss rate is independent of the
electron Lorentz factor γ (eq. [33]).

Each electron energy bin thus evolves by the same amount in
a given time, such that the electron distribution evolves with down-
stream travel time t according to

same energy distribution in the leptonic case. For ease of compar-
ison to the leptonic case, the spectrum is normalized such that a
fraction e of the post-shock thermal pressure is placed into pairs.

4.3 Radiative Transfer Equation

The radio emission from thermal and nonthermal leptons down-
stream of the shock is governed by the radiative transfer equation,
which can be conveniently written in terms of the brightness tem-
perature Tν (Rybicki & Lightman 1979),
dTν

where T is the gas temperature,

is the synchrotron brightness temperature, and τν = (cid:82)

αﬀdz is the
free-free optical depth. Here z is the depth behind the shock and
αﬀ is the free-free absorption coeﬃcient (eq. [13]). For conditions
in post-shock region, the relevant pre-factor in (eq. [13]) is now
α0 = 0.28 cm5 K−3/2. We neglect sychrotron self-absorption, which
is only relevant in the case of relativistic brightness temperatures of
Tν ≥ 1011 K, which are much higher than synchrotron brightness
temperature calculated with free-free absorption (eq. [50]).

It is useful to change variables from free-free optical depth τν

to temperature, according to (Metzger et al. 2014)

dτν = αﬀ

using the temperature gradient dT/dz = 2n2Λ(T)/(5kn4 ˜v f ) behind
the shock set by cooling. Both the free-free absorption coeﬃcient
and the cooling rate scale as ∝ n2, allowing for a one-to-one (up to a
coeﬃcient) mapping τν(T) given knowledge of Λ(T). Notably, this
mapping is independent of the details of how the gas compresses
behind the shock.

Figure 8 shows τν/τν,0 as a function of temperature T behind
the shock, where τν,0 = n4,7v8/ν2
10 and τν = 0 is deﬁned at the for-
ward shock surface (T = T3; eq. [6]). The ﬁrst case shown employs
just free-free cooling without line cooling (i.e. Λ = Λﬀ; eq. [19]),
while in the second case we should the result with full line cooling
included (Schure et al. 2009).
In the line cooling case, the radio photosphere (τν = 1) occurs
at a temperature of ≈ 104 K. In the free-free case the photosphere
can occur at a much higher temperature, depending on τ0,ν. This
shows that observed brightness temperatures of ∼> 105 K (Fig. 4)
can result from thermal emission only if line cooling is suppressed
from its standard CIE value (Metzger et al. 2014). However, if line
cooling is present, additional contributions from non-thermal syn-
chrotron emission is required ahead of the photosphere to achieved
the observed peak radio ﬂuxes.

The sychrotron emissivity is given by an integral over the elec-

tron distribution function,

This yields reasonably accurate results for broad and smooth elec-

We assume that downstream of the shock the magnetic ﬁeld
does not decay as the plasma cools and compresses, and that its
strength scales with density as B = Bsh(n/n3)Γ, where Γ = 2/3 for
the ﬂux freezing of a tangled (statistically isotropic) ﬁeld geometry.
Our results are not sensitive to this choice because, for any physical
value of Γ, the integrated emission will be found to be dominated
by the ﬁrst cooling length behind the shock (§5.1). However, once

to dissipate the small-scale magnetic ﬁeld which was produced at
the shock. Using CE ∝ n(p+2)/3 appropriate for adiabatic compres-
sion, the emissivity scales as jν,syn ∝ n(2p+3)/3. Figure 10 shows the
frequency dependence of the emissivity for electrons from shock
acceleration and pion decay for the same value of e = 0.08. For
comparison we also show the thermal free-free emissivity.

5.1.1 Radiative Shocks
Low velocity shocks (v8 ∼< 1) are radiative and line cooling ex-
ceeds free-free cooling behind the shock. The radio photosphere
τν > 1 is reached in this case only at temperatures T ∼< 104 K
(Fig. 8). Because the latter is signiﬁcantly lower than the observed
brightness temperatures (Fig. 4), one concludes that non-thermal
radiation with Tν,syn (cid:29) T must dominate the emission. This in turn
justiﬁes neglectecting T compared to Tν,syn in equation (49).

If free-free emission dominates the cooling (δ = 0.5), the emis-
sion will receive equal contributions from each decade in tem-
perature behind the shock (Metzger et al. 2014). For line cooling
(δ = −0.7) the dominant contribution again comes from the ﬁrst
cooling length.

Figure 11 shows how the 10 GHz brightness temperature
grows as a function of temperature behind the shock for diﬀer-
ent assumptions about the cooling and emission of the post-shock
gas. At high optical depths the radiation and gas possess the same
temperature (Tν = T) because synchrotron emission is not present
in the cold central shell. However, diﬀerences in Tν become pro-
nounced as the shock front is approached at T = T3. With line
cooling included, only the ﬁrst cooling length behind the shock
signiﬁcantly contributes to the ﬁnal brightness temperature at the
shock surface. Again it is clear that thermal emission alone cannot

Figures 12 and 13 compare our analytic expressions for the peak
observed brightness temperature (eqs. [54, 55]) and the peak value
resulting from a direct integration of equation (49). Except for the
shock parameters varied in these ﬁgures, all other parameters were
taken to be those of our best-ﬁt for V1324 Sco (Table 4).

The top panel of Figure 12 shows how T nth

ν,pk depends on the
density scale-height H and the ionized fraction of the preshock
layer, fEUV. When the value of H is small, or fEUV is suﬃciently
high, then the entire DES scaleheight is ionized (H = ∆ion) and
the peak brightness temperature is independent of fEUV. On the
other hand, when ∆ion < H, then the brightness temperature is in-
dependent of H but decreases with increasing ionizing radiation as

Figure 13 compares the brightness temperature calculated in
a purely thermal model (e = 0) to our analytic estimate of T th
ν,pk
(eq. [54]). For a broad range of parameters, the peak temperatures
fails to exceed 105 K, making thermal models of radiative shocks
hard to reconcile with observations (see Fig.4). The same conclu-
sion can be drawn directly by examining equation (54).

5.1.2 Adiabatic shocks
For higher velocities v8 ∼> 108 cm s−1 the shock will be adiabatic.
The brightness temperature is again estimated by assuming that the
ﬁrst scaleheight H behind the shock dominates the emission, i.e.
neglecting ongoing emission from matter shocked many dynamical
times earlier. However, unlike with radiative shocks, this assump-
tion cannot be rigorously justiﬁed without a radiation hydrodynam-
ical simulation, an undertaking beyond the scope of this paper.
The peak brightness temperature in the adiabatic case is esti-
mated using the expressions for radiative shocks from §5.1.1, but
replacing the ﬁrst cooling length behind the shock tcool ˜v f with H.
For purely thermal emission, the brightness temperature is

In deriving equation (58) we have used npk = nH,pk, i.e. we have as-
sumed that the whole DES scaleheight is ionized. This assumption
might be questionable because for adiabatic shocks, only a frac-
tion of shock-dissipated power is radiated and hence fEUV can fall
below minimal value set by free-free emission (8). However, due
to the high kinetic power of high velocity shocks, and the positive
temperature dependence of the free-free cooling rate, in practice
the UV radiation from adiabatic shocks is suﬃcient to ionize all of
the upstream gas for physical values of H.

non-thermal synchrotron emission [dash-dotted lines], and (2) whether the

includes emission lines [red]. A purple line shows the non-thermal case with
free-free cooling, including the eﬀect of Coulomb losses on the emitting
relativistic leptons. All calculations were performed for a pre-shock density

produce temperatures (cid:29) 104 K required by observations unless line
cooling is suppressed, e.g. by non-LTE eﬀects.

Coulomb cooling of relativistic electrons only noticeably im-
pacts the non-thermal emission well downstream of the shock, in
regions where the gas temperature is ∼< 105 K (eq. [33]). Coulomb
losses therefore signiﬁcantly impact the observed radiation temper-
ature only in the case of free-free cooling, for which contributions
to the emission from the post-shock gas Tν ∝ T 1/6 (eq. [52]) vary
only weakly with gas temperature. Even in this case, however, the
observed temperature reduced only by a factor of ∼ 2 compared to
an otherwise identical case neglecting Coulomb losses. Coulomb
corrections become completely negligible when line cooling is in-
cluded because the bulk of the emission comes from immediately
behind the shock, where the temperature is high and the density is
low. For this reason we hereafter neglect the impact of Coulomb
cooling because our ﬁducial models account for line cooling.

Thus far we have concentrated on calculating the emission
temperature at the forward shock (the ‘unscreened’ temperature,
Tν|shock in eq. [11]), and we have not yet accounted for free-free
attebuation in the ionized layer ahead of the shock. The observed
brightness temperature Tb only equals that of the shock, Tν|shock,
once the density of the upstream gas has become suﬃciently low
(n4 ∼< npk; eq. [11]). The measured peak brightness temperature,
Tν,pk, is thus obtained by substituting n4 = npk (eq. [15]) into equa-
tions (52) and (53) for T = T3, n = n3. Multiplying the resulting
expression by a factor of 1/e (since at radio peak τν = 1) yields

is a decreasing function of the shock velocity. This is due to the
αﬀ ∝ T−3/2 dependence of free-free absorption, which dominates
over the eﬀect of the higher gas temperature. Comparing equations
(56) and (58) shows that a maximum thermal brightness temper-
ature of ≈ 104 K is thus obtained for the shock velocity v8 ∼ 1
separating radiative from adiabatic shocks. The fact that this falls
well short of observed peak brightness temperatures (Fig. 4) rules
out thermal models for the early radio peak, even considering adi-
abatic shocks (again unless non-CIE eﬀects suppress line cooling
behind the shock; Metzger et al. 2014).

mechanism and hence apply both to purely thermal emission (Met-
zger et al. 2014) as well as the non-thermal emission studied here.
Figure 14 shows an example model light curve (upper panel) and
corresponding evolution of the spectral index across two represen-
tative frequency ranges (bottom panel). At higher frequencies the
light curve peaks earlier and reaches a larger maximum ﬂux. This
behavior is due to a combination of the frequency dependence of
free-free absorption (αﬀ ∝ ν−2) and the temporally declining shock
power. if this behaviour is not obeyed by observations, this indi-
cates that our one zone shock model is inadequate or that free-free
opacity does not control the light curve maximum (§6.3).

The spectral index β initially rises to exceed that of optically-
thick isothermal gas (β > 2) because the higher frequency emis-
sion peaks ﬁrst. Then, once the lower frequency emission peaks,
the shock becomes optically thin and hence the spectral index ap-
proaches the spectral index of optically thin synchrotron emission.
Importantly, a ﬂat spectral index does not itself provide conclusive
evidence for non-thermal synchrotron emission, even though the
optically thin spectral indices are diﬀerent for synchrotron and ther-
mal bremstrahlung emission. The emission mechanism is instead
more accurately distinguished from thermal emission based on the
higher peak brightness temperatures which can be achieved by non-
thermal models. Also, at late times the radio emission should even-
tually come to be dominated by thermal emission of the photo-
ionized ejecta and hence the spectral index will again rise to β = 2.
This feature is not captured in Fig. 14 because we have not included
thermal emission from the cool central shell or from other source
of freely expanding photo-ionized gas.

5.3 Fits to Individual Novae

We have ﬁt our model to the radio light curves of three novae
with early-time coverage, V1324 Sco, V1723 Aql and V5589 Sgr
(Figs. 3, 4). We employ a χ-squared minimization technique across
9 free parameters: v1, v4, n4/n1, ∆t, H, n0, p, e, fEUV. We assume the
shock covering fraction is fΩ = 1 and take B = 0.01 (the latter is
degenerate with e). Table 4 provides the best-ﬁt parameters of our
model. Although the electron power-law index p was left as a free
parameter, it always converged to a value of 2 in our best-ﬁt mod-
els. For convenience, we report also shock velocity v8, even though
it is not independent of the other parameters.
Our best ﬁt to V1324 Sco is shown in the upper panel of Figure
15. Our best-ﬁt shock velocity of 640 km s−1 is within the range of
radiative shocks, consistent with the rapid post-maximum decline.
For the parameters of our best-ﬁt model, npk,∆/npk,H = 0.96ν10, im-
plying that for frequencies above(below) 10 GHz the thickness of
ionization layer is less than(greater than) the scale height at the
time of peak ﬂux. The transition between these two regimes can
be seen as small break in the 7.4 GHz light curve around day 68.
Substituting our best-ﬁt parameters in fromula 1, we ﬁnd that the
collision has happened 20 days after the start of the outﬂow, i. e.
on MJD of 56100. From (Ackermann et al. 2014), we know that
γ-ray emission gas started around MJD 56093. The γ-ray emission
has started ≈ 7 days before our calculated time of collision. This
can be attributed to the fact that both of shells may not necessarily
be ejected in a single episode, but instead their ejection can last for
couple of days or even for weeks.

V1723 Aql was more challenging to ﬁt (Fig.15, middle panel),
mainly because diﬀerent frequencies peak at nearly the same time,
contrary to the the expectation that high frequency light curves will
peak ﬁrst if free-free absorption indeed controls the light curve rise.
We describe alternative interpretations of the peculiar V1723 Aql

in detail, we nevertheless reproduce the magnitude the peak bright-
ness temperatures for reasonable parameters.

The data for V5589 Sgr is more sparse than the other two
events. Our best-ﬁt model is shown in the bottom panel of Figure
15. For our best-ﬁt parameters in this case, npk,∆/npk,H = 0.43ν10,

6 DISCUSSION

6.1 Eﬃciency of Relativistic Particle Acceleration

8 e3/4

B ≈ 7 × 10−5 − 1.2 × 10−4,

Non-thermal radio emission from novae probes relativistic particle
acceleration and magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation at the shocks, as pa-
rameterized through e and B. Considering all three novae from
the previous section, we inferred electron acceleration eﬃciencies
in the range e ∼ 0.01 − 0.08 (Table 4). However, the peak radio
luminosity is largely degenerate in e, B and ˜v f . By combining the
peak 10 GHz luminosity of V1324 Sco, V1723 Aql, and V5589
Sgr with our analytic estimates of the peak brightness temperature
(eq. [55]) and assuming a shock radius equal to that of our best ﬁt
model (Rsh = v4tpeak; Table 4), we obtain the following limits,
fΩv7.9
where we have again assumed radiative shocks (v8 ∼< 1).
ing the very conservative assumption that e + B ∼< 1, i.e. e3/4
0.5, we ﬁnd
v8 ∼> 0.4 f −0.13
This lower limit on the shock temperature, for example, ensures
that any thermal free-free emission from the shocks will fall within
the Swift or Chandra bandpass and hence the radio emitting elec-
trons should have some measurable X-ray signature, even if its too
weak to detect or is overpowered by fast polar shocks.

We now consider implications of these constraints. First, mak-

Next, using our best ﬁt parameters for the shock velocities v8
of each nova (Table 4) and assuming an error on this quantity of 10
per cent, each event separately provides a constraint
1.2 × 10−3 ≤ fΩe3/4

B ≤ 5.4 × 10−3 V1324 Sco
B ≤ 10−3 V1723 Aql
B ≤ 9 × 10−4 V5589 Sgr

2.3 × 10−4 ≤ fΩe3/4
2 × 10−4 ≤ fΩe3/4
For realistic values of B < 0.1 (Caprioli & Spitkovsky
2014b), we thus require e ∼> 10−3 − 10−2. Importantly, these high
acceleration eﬃciencies disfavor hadronic scenarios for the radio-
emitting leptons, which we estimated to produce e ∼< 10−4 in equa-
tion (31).

(63)
(64)
(65)

Such high values of e are also in tension with PIC simula-
tions of particle acceleration at non-relativistic shocks (Kato 2014;
Park et al. 2014) which ﬁnd e ∼ 10−4 when extrapolated to shock
velocities v8 ∼< 103 km s−1, modeling of supernova remnants (Mor-
lino & Caprioli 2012; e ∼ 10−4), and galactic cosmic ray emission
(Strong et al. 2010; e ∼ 10−3). On the other hand, modeling of
younger radio supernovae typically ﬁnd higher values of e (Cheva-
lier 1982; Chandra et al. 2012), consistent with our results, and the
cosmic ray eﬃciencies are dependent on the shock fraction of the
accelerated electrons which escape the supernova remnant. Given
potential diﬀerences between the environments and magnetic ﬁeld
geometry of nova shocks and supernova remnants, as well as un-
certainties in theoretical numerical modeling, it seems reasonable
to favor a leptonic source for the radio-emitting electrons.
In the above we have assumed that the shocks cover a large
fraction of the outﬂow surface ( fΩ ∼ 1). However, if instead we
have fΩ < 1 then the required values of e and B would be
even higher than their already strained values. If the radio-emitting
shocks are radiative, they must therefore possess a large covering
fraction fΩ ∼ 1.

Lower values of e and B are allowed if the peak radio emis-
sion is instead dominated by high-velocity v8 ∼> 1, adiabatic shocks
covering a large solid fraction fΩ ∼ 1. This is because the sensi-
tive dependence of the brightness temperature on the shock velocity
implies that even a moderate increase in v8 can increase the radio
ﬂux by orders of magnitude at ﬁxed e, B. On the other hand, the
adiabatic shocks responsible for the hard X-rays in novae may be
required to possess a small covering fraction fΩ (cid:28) 1 so as not to
overproduce the observed X-ray luminosities (§2.4).

We conclude by addressing the implications of our results for
the mechanism of the gamma-ray emission. The observed ratio of
optical and gamma-ray luminosities in V1324 Sco allowed Metzger
et al. (2015) to place a lower limit of nth = p + e > 10−2 on the
total fraction of the shock energy placed into non-thermal particles
(protons in hadronic scenarios and electrons in leptonic scenarios).
Assuming that the radio and gamma-ray emitting shocks possess
identical microphysical parameters, and that the gamma-rays are
leptonic in origin (nth = e ∼ 0.01 − 0.1), then by combining this
constraint with our constraints on V1324 Sco from equation (63)
we ﬁnd
3 × 10−3 ≤ B ≤ 2 × 10−2 V1324 Sco

(66)

Even if the radio emission is leptonic in origin, it is important to
note that this does not exclude the gamma-ray emission from being
hadronic.

The presence of a dense external medium was not implicated in
novae until the discovery of gamma-ray emission. In this section
we estimate the radio emission from the fast nova ejecta interacting
with the stellar wind of the nova progenitor system, in order to
exclude this source of a DES. The density proﬁle of a spherically
symmetric, steady-state wind is given by
nw (cid:39)
where r = r141014 cm is radius, vw = vw,8108 cm s−1 is the wind
speed, and ˙M = ˙M−1010−10M(cid:12) yr−1 is the mass-loss rate.

equating (67) with npk,H (eq. [15]) for a density scaleheight H ∼ r,
(68)
(69)

rw,pk = 1.5 × 1011ν
Although nw,pk is several orders larger than in our ﬁducial DES
models, the radius of the photosphere is 3 orders of magnitude
smaller. Under these conditions the shock is adiabatic and hence
the peak brightness temperature is found by substituting nw,pk and
rw,pk into equation (59), which gives (for p = 2)

(with an assumed scale height H = 5 × 1012 cm) convolved with a
Gaussian proﬁle of diﬀerent widths σ, in order to crudely mimick
the eﬀects of non-simultaneous shock emergence. The top panel
shows the unaltered radio lightcurve, i.e. assuming simultaneous
shock emergence, which again makes clear that the high frequen-
cies peak ﬁrst (§2.2). The middle and bottom panels show the same
light curve, but smeared over time intervals of σ = 2 days and
σ = 5 days, respectively. In this way we can get radio lightcurves
with diﬀerence in peak time at diﬀerent frequencies substantially
smaller than the rise/fall time, as observed in V1723 Aql.

6.3.2 Collision With Optically Thin Shell

The free-free optical depth of a shell of radial thickness D =

Another possibility is that the radio-producing shock occurs in a
dilute thin shell, with a lower density than the mean density of the
DES, i.e. n0 (cid:28) npk ∼ 107 cm−1. Absorption then plays no part in
the rise of the radio lightcurve, which is instead controlled by the
time required for the shock to cross the radial width of the shell.
1014D14 cm and temperature Tsh = 2 · 104 K is given by
τsh = 3.5n2

where τsh = 0.1τsh,−1 is normalized to a suﬃciently low value so as
not to inﬂuence the radio lightcurve signiﬁcantly.

Although the parameter space for an optically thin shell (τsh <
0.1) which is radiative (η ∼< 1) is not large, this represents a viable
explanation for the behavior of V1723 Aquila.

6.4 Radio Emission from Polar Adiabatic Shocks

Figure 6 shows our prediction for the maximum X-ray luminosity
and the maximum 10 GHz radio luminosity as a function of the
shock velocity, spanning the range from radiative (v8 ∼< 1) to adia-
batic (v8 ∼> 1) shocks. Both radio and X-ray luminosities increase
by many orders of magnitude across this range. However, their ra-
tio LR/LX coincidentally varies only weakly with v8, as shown in
Figure 17. Absolute luminosities depend on the covering fraction
and radius of the shock, but this ratio is obviously independent
of these uncertain quantities. Reasonable variations in the density
scaleheight H, ionization fraction fEUV, and the CNO abundances
result in a factor ∼< 3 variation in this ratio (Fig. 17, top panel),
which is instead most sensitive to the microphysical parameters,
∝ e3/4
for p = 2 (Fig. 17, bottom panel). Any shock producing
X-rays will therefore also produce radio emission of intensity com-
parable to the observed values. Fig. 17 shows for comparison the
measured value of LR/LX, or limits on its value, using the observed
peak X-ray and non-thermal radio luminosities for ﬁve novae.

B

The luminosity ratio can deviate from its value shown in
Fig. 17 if the density of the shocked shell is suﬃciently low that
the optical depth of the DES to radio or X-rays is ∼< 1, i.e. if its cen-
tral density obeys ¯n (cid:28) nX, npk. The ratio of the density of maximum
X-ray emission nX (eq. [25]) to that of maximum radio emission npk
(eq. [15]) is given by

6.3 Light Curve of V1723 Aquila

Our model does not provide a satisfactory ﬁt to the light curve of
V1723 Aql because all radio frequencies peak nearly simultane-
ously (Fig. 15), in contrast to the expectation if the rise of the light
curve is controlled by the eﬀects of free-free opacity (§5.3). In this
section we describe two modiﬁcations to the standard picture that
could potentially account for this behavior.

6.3.1

Steep density gradient

(cid:33)

cm,

3 day

(cid:32) ∆tpk

The V1723 Aql light curves are consistent with all frequencies
peaking within a time interval ∆tpk ∼< few days. From equation (16)
this requires a scale height of thickness
H ∼< ∆tpk ˜v f = 2.6 × 1013v8
(71)
i.e. much smaller than the shock radius Rsh ∼ 1014 − 1015 cm. How-
ever, such a steep gradient should also result in a short rise and
fall time, inconsistent with the relatively broad peak observed in
V1723 Aql. This apparent contradiction could be alleviated if the
shock reaches the critical density of peak emission n = npk at dif-
ferent times across diﬀerent parts of the ejecta surface. In this case
the total light curve, comprised of the emission from all locations,
would be “smeared out” in time while still maintaining the nearly
frequency-independent peak time set by the steep gradient.

or if the CNO mass fraction is doubled. The bottom panel shows the more
sensitive dependence of the luminosity ratio on the shock microphysical pa-
rameters e and B, calculated for H14 = 1, fEUV = 0.1, and standard CNO

(triangles) on the luminosity ratio of the novae compiled in Table 3.

npk ∼< ¯n ∼< nX, in which case the X-ray emission is optically thin
at peak and hence the ratio LR/LX will be higher than its value in
Figure 17. Likewise, when ¯n ∼< npk, nX (both X-rays and radio are
optically thin at peak), we have that LR/LX ∝ ¯n−1/4 also increases
with decreasing ¯n. In summary, the radio to X-ray luminosity ratio
in Fig. 17 is a conservative minimum, which is achieved in the limit
of a high density DES.

In some novae X-rays are observed at early times which are
too hard to originate from radiative shocks (Table 3, Figure 5).
As discussed in §2.4, this emission could instead originate from
fast, low density adiabatic shocks in the polar regions (Fig. 1). If
at all times the X-rays originate from fast polar shocks and the ra-
dio emission from slower equatorial radiative shocks, then based
on the above discussion the measured ratio LR/LX = LR,rad/LX +
LR,ad/LX, comprised of contributions from both radiative and adi-
abatic shocks, should exceed the ratio shown in Figure 17. For

7 CONCLUSIONS

We have studied non-thermal synchrotron radio emission from ra-
diative shocks (and, to a lesser extent, adiabatic shocks) as a model
for the early radio peaks in novae by means of a one-dimensional
model. Broadly speaking, we ﬁnd that the measured brightness
temperatures can be explained for physically reasonable parame-
ters of the shock velocity and microphysical parameters e and B
(Table 4). The detection of an early radio peak in novae requires the
presence of DES with a density of ∼> 106 − 107 cm−3 at a radius of
≈ 1014 − 1015 cm. The emission from the nova ejecta running into
a progenitor wind of mass loss rate ˙M ∼ 10−11 − 10−9M(cid:12) yr−1 is
not suﬃcient to explain the peak ﬂux observed in the events V1723
Aql, V1324 Sco and V5589 Sgr (§6.2).

The thin layer of photo-ionized gas ahead of the forward shock
plays a key role in our model: its free-free optical depth deter-
mines the time, intensity and spectral indices near the peak of the
emission (see § 2.2). One-dimensional models robustly predict that
higher frequency emission peaks at earlier times, imprinting a dis-
tinct evolution on the spectral index (Figure 14) which is indepen-
dent of whether the emission mechanism is thermal or non-thermal.
V1324 Sco and V5589 Sgr do exhibit this behavior, but in V1723
Aql the light curves at all frequencies peak at nearly the same time.
Possible explanation include the collision of the nova outﬂow oc-
curing with a shell of much lower density than the mean density
of the nova ejecta (§6.3). Alternatively, the evolution may appear
achromatic if the shock breaks out of the DES at diﬀerent times
across diﬀerent parts of its surface, as would occur if the DES is
not spherically symmetric (Fig. 16).

Since the prediction that high frequencies peak ﬁrst does not
depend on emission mechanism, one cannot distinguish thermal
from non-thermal emission based on the spectral index evolu-
tion alone. The thermal model was found to exhibit spectral in-
dex behaviour dominated by free-free absorption eﬀects (Metzger
et al. 2014) which is very similar to spectral index behaviour in
non-thermal synchroton model (Figure 14). The presence of non-
thermal emission is best characterized by the much higher bright-
ness temperatures which can be achieved than for thermal emission.
Shocks with velocities ∼< 1000 km s−1 are radiative due to eﬃ-
cient line cooling of the CNO-enriched nova ejecta (§2.3). Indirect
evidence for radiative shocks in V1324 Sco includes the rapid post-
maximum decline of the radio lightcurve. Our ﬁt of this event with
a radiative shock model was better than for V5589 Sgr and V1723
Aql, and the inferred shock velocity was lower. Multiple lines of
evidence therefore support the radio-emitting shocks in V1324 Sco
being radiative.

The relativistic electrons (or positrons) responsible for the
non-thermal synchrotron emission originate either from direct dif-
fusive acceleration at the shock (leptonic scenario), or as secondary
products from the decays of pions produced in proton-proton colli-
sions (hadronic scenario). In either case, the radio-emitting leptons
are identical, or tightly related to, the particles which power the ob-
served γ-ray emission. For instance, if the observed ∼> 100 MeV
gamma-rays are produced by relativistic bremmstrahlung emission
c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

(as favored in leptonic scenario by Metzger et al. 2015), then the
energy of the radiating electrons (also ∼> 100 MeV) are very close
to those which determine the peak of the radio synchrotron emis-
sion at later times (eq. [29]). Likewise, gamma-rays from π0 decay
in hadronic scenarios are accompanied by electron/positron pairs
with energies ∼> 100 MeV in the same range, as determined by the
pion rest mass. Once produced, relativistic leptons evolve approxi-
mately adiabatically downstream of the shock for conditions which
characterize the radio maximum. The only exception is Coulomb
cooling in the unlikely case that free-free emission dominates the
post-shock cooling of the thermal gas (Fig. 11).

In hadronic scenarios, only a small fraction of relativistic pro-
tons produce pions in the downstream before being advected into
the central cold shell (from which radio emission is heavily atten-
uated by free-free absorption). This means that the relativistic pro-
tons can provide considerable pressure support in the post-shock
cooling layer, possibly preventing the gas to compress beyond a
factor of ∼ 10 times (see §4.1). The possible role of clumping
due to thermal instability of the radiative shock on this non-thermal
pressure support deserves further attention, as the central shell may
provide an ideal shielded environment for dust and molecule for-
mation in novae (Derdzinski et al., in prep).

The low pion production eﬃciency in the post-shock layer also
implies that of the ∼< 10% of the total shock power placed into rela-
tivistic protons, only a tiny fraction e ∼ 10−4 (eq. [31]) goes into e±
pairs producing radio emission. For physical values of B ∼< 0.1, the
B ∼< 10−5 which controls the brightness temper-
critical product e3/4
ature is a few orders of magnitude below that required by data of
∼ 10−4 − 10−3 (eq. [63-65]). We therefore disfavor the hadronic
scenario for radio-producing leptons. This alone does not rule out
a hadronic origin for γ-ray emission, but it does suggest that the
direct acceleration of electrons is occuring at the gamma-ray pro-
ducing shocks.

Within leptonic scenarios, the values of e3/4
B

required by the
radio data are typically higher than those measured from PIC sim-
ulations (Caprioli & Spitkovsky 2014a) and by modeling Galac-
tic SN remnants (Morlino & Caprioli 2012). However, values of
B ∼ 10−4 − 10−3 do appear similar to those inferred by model-
e3/4
ing young radio supernovae (e.g. Chandra et al. 2012).

We conﬁrm the ﬁnding of Metzger et al. (2014) that when CIE
line cooling is included, thermal emission from radiative shocks
cannot explain the early high brightness temperature radio peak.
Perhaps the best evidence for non-thermal radio emission comes
from cases like V1324 Sco, where no X-ray emission is detected.
An X-ray non-detection implies a low velocity, radiative shock,
which would is especially challenged to produce a signiﬁcant radio
ﬂux without a non-thermal contribution. We can also rule out ther-
mal emission from an adiabatic shock, at least under the assump-
tion that only the ﬁrst scaleheight behind the shock dominates that
contributing to the observed emission (§6.4). Future radiation hy-
drodynamical simulations of adiabatic shocks and their radio emis-
sion in the case of a steep density gradient are needed to determine
whether thermal adiabatic shocks can be completely ruled out.

We have derived analytic expressions for the peak brightness
temperature of non-thermal synchroton emission (eq. [56]). Our
model can reproduce the observed ﬂuxes of V5589 Sgr, V1723
Aql, V1324 Sco and, in the case of V1324 Sco, details of the radio
lightcurve. Non-detections of early radio peak from V959 Mon and
V339 Del place upper limits on e, B. The upper limits for V339
Del and V959 Mon are broadly consistent with the inferred values
of e, B values for novae with detected early radio peak.

20

In summary, radio observations of novae provide a important
tool for studying particle acceleration and magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁ-
cation in shocks which is complementary to γ-rays observarions.
They also inform our understanding of the structure of the nova
ejecta and internal shocks, which may vary considerably with time
and as a function of polar angle.
