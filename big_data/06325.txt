We report optical spectroscopy and ultrafast pump-probe measurements on the antiferromagnetic heavy
fermion compound CePt2In7, a member showing stronger two dimensionality than other compounds in CeIn3-
derived heavy-fermion family. We identify clear and typical hybridization spectral structures at low temperature
from the two diﬀerent spectroscopy probes. However, the strength and related energy scale of the hybridization
are much weaker and smaller than that in the superconducting compounds CeCoIn5 and CeIrIn5. The features
are more similar to observations on the antiferromagnetic compounds CeIn3 and CeRhIn5 in the same fam-
ily. The results clearly indicate that the Kondo interaction and hybridizations exist in the antiferromagnetic
compounds but with weaker strength.

INTRODUCTION

Heavy fermion (HF) systems containing elements with a
partially ﬁlled 4 f - or 5 f -electron shell are among the most
fascinating materials in condensed matter physics. The strong
correlation of f -electrons and their coupling to the conduc-
tion electrons result in a wide range of exotic phenomena,
e.g. magnetic order, unconventional superconductivity, quan-
tum criticality, and a Fermi liquid state with heavy electron
mass. Depending on temperature the f -electrons show both
itinerant and localized behaviors. A great deal of attention has
been given to the similarities and peculiarities among diﬀer-
ent HF systems. Among the most extensively studied systems
are the family CemMnIn3m+2n, because diﬀerent compounds
in the family exhibit signiﬁcantly diﬀerent ground states in
spite of similar lattice structures[1–6]. The compounds are
constituted by the alternate stacking of CeIn3 and MIn2 build-
ing blocks, where M stands for transition metals. Depending
on the speciﬁc values of m and n, which represent the num-
bers of CeIn3 and MIn2 layers respectively, there are several
types of heavy fermion systems discovered in this family until
now: CeIn3[1], CeMIn5[2–4], CePt2In7[5], Ce2MIn8[6] and
Ce3MIn11[7, 8], etc.

The ground states of heavy fermion materials generally can
be depicted by the Doniach’s phase diagram, which was pro-
posed initially to described the competition between Kondo
and Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions in
cerium compounds[9]. Although both of them originate from
the exchange interaction JK between conduction electrons and
local f moments, the Kondo eﬀect tends to generate a non-
magnetic Fermi liquid ground state with all the local moments
screened by conduction electrons and is characterized by the
Kondo temperature TK ∼ exp(−1/JK); whereas, the RKKY
exchange interaction enhances long range magnetic order with
an energy scale TRKKY ∼ J2
K. When JK is very small, the
RKKY interaction dominates the Kondo eﬀect and gives rise
to long range magnetic orders. When JK is suﬃciently large,
the Kondo eﬀect dominates and the coupling between f -
electron and conduction electrons will lead to a hybridiza-

tion gap ∆HG opening in the density of states (DOS) near the
Fermi energy, the energy scale of which is a measure of the hy-
bridization strength. Signiﬁcantly, a quantum phase transition
from magnetic to heavy Fermi liquid state is expected to occur
when a delicate energy balance between RKKY and Kondo
interactions is approached. Unconventional superconductivity
frequently appears in the vicinity of the such quantum phase
transition[10]. For example, antiferromagnetic (AFM) order
in CeIn3 and CeRhIn5 can be suppressed by the application of
pressure and gives way to a heavy fermion superconducting
state, because hybridization is strengthened due to a reduction
of their lattice constants[11, 12].

As a relative new member of the CemMnIn3m+2n family,
CePt2In7 also undergoes an AFM phase transition at the
Neel temperature TN =5.2 K[13]. Quantum oscillation mea-
surements reveal the two-dimensionality of its Fermi sur-
faces, in accord with the layered lattice structure[14]. The
long range AFM order is reported to be either commen-
surate or incommensurate by muon-spin rotation [15], Nu-
clear Quadrupolar Resonance[16] and Nuclear Magnetic Res-
onance measurements[17], depending on details of synthesis
conditions for single or polycrystal samples. The AFM tran-
sition is suppressed by applying pressure, and superconduc-
tivity emerges in a broad dome. Particularly, the highest Tc
appears at a critical pressure where the Neel temperature ap-
proaches zero Kelvin, implying the existence of a quantum
critical point[18]. In addition, Knight shift measurements re-
veal that the hybridized quasiparicles begin to ”relocalize” be-
fore entering the AFM phase, possibly as a precursor to the
AFM order[19].

Here, we report infrared spectroscopy and ultrafast pump-
probe measurements on single crystalline CePt2In7. As these
experiments show, infrared spectroscopy is an ideal method in
studying heavy fermion materials, since it provides direct in-
formation on not only the magnitude of the hybridization gap
but also the enhancement of eﬀective mass. The ultrafast mea-
surement also are a very useful tool in detecting small energy
gaps in the DOS, which supplies supplementary information
on the electronic properties.

INFRARED SPECTROCOPY

CePt2In7 single crystals were grown by self-ﬂux method, as
described in reference [13]. Platelike crystals with shiny sur-
faces were obtained after eliminating extra ﬂux. The in-plane
reﬂectivity R(ω) was measured by the Fourier transform in-
frared spectrometer Bruker 113 V, and 80V in the frequency
range from 40 to 25 000 cm−1 . The in situ gold and alu-
minium overcoating techniques were employed to obtain the
absolute value of reﬂectivity. The optical conductivity was
derived from R(ω) through the Kramers-Kronig transforma-
tion. The low frequency reﬂectivity was extrapolated to unit
by Hugen-Rubens relations. At the high energy side, R(ω) was
extrapolated as ω−0.2 to 800 000 cm−1 , and higher frequencies
are assumed to decay as ω−4.

FIG. 1. (a) The temperature dependent reﬂectivity R(ω) of CePt2In7.
The inset shows the R(ω) in a larger frequency range. (b) The temper-
ature dependent optical conductivity σ1(ω). The inset shows σ1(ω)
in a larger frequency range up to 25 000 cm−1 .

The frequency dependent reﬂectivity of CePt2In7 is plotted
in Fig.1 (a) at several selected temperatures. Although the re-
sistivity of this compound decreases with decreasing temper-
ature and exhibits a slight downward curvatures around 100
K [13], the reﬂectivity R(ω) shows a very weak temperature
dependence. Except for tiny discrepancies at the dip structure
around 5000 cm−1 and bump around 11 000 cm−1 , the reﬂec-
tivity at diﬀerent temperatures almost overlap, as shown in
the inset of Fig.1 (a). This result suggestes that the electronic

2

structures of the compound are quite stable against tempera-
ture changing. The main panel of Fig.1 (a) displays the en-
larged view of R(ω) in the frequency range below 2500 cm−1 ,
which focuses on the low energy evolutions. When the fre-
quency decreases to zero, R(ω) approaches unity at all mea-
sured temperatures, indicative of metallic behavior. Above
100 K, the low energy R(ω) increases slightly with cooling,
consistent with a typical metallic temperature dependence.
However, R(ω) exhibits a very weak depletion structure at 8
K, demonstrating the renormalization of underlying electronic
structures. Remarkably, this feature is quite similar with the
reﬂectivity of antiferromagnetic CeRhIn5 [20]; whereas, there
are signiﬁcant contrasts with that of superconductors CeCoIn5
and CeIrIn5 [20, 21].

The real part of the optical conductivity σ1(ω) of CePt2In7
is displayed in Fig.1 (b). For temperatures above 100 K, the
low energy responses are dominated by a Drude-like shape.
The half width of the Drude peak narrows slightly as temper-
ature decreases, and the dc conductivity (σ1(ω = 0)) is en-
hanced concurrently, in good agreement with previous trans-
port measurement [13]. When temperature is lowered to 8 K,
a minimum appears at very low frequency, and a weak bump
develops that corresponds to a suppression of the reﬂectivity.
At the same time, the Drude peak shifts dramatically to lower
energy. All these characters are consistent with the typical
optical response of heavy fermion materials. Upon entering
the coherence state where the local moments start to become
screened by conduction electrons, the scattering rate is sharply
reduced and gives rise to a narrowing of the Drude peak. Con-
currently, spectral weight of the Drude component is substan-
tially removed because the eﬀective mass of free carriers be-
comes much heavier. The weak bump feature is attributed to
optical excitations across a hybridization gap.

component that describes excitations across energy gaps or
interband transitions. We ﬁnd that σ1(ω) can be well repro-
duced by one Drude term and four Lorentz terms at high tem-
peratures, but an additional Lorentz term is required at 8 K, as
shown in Fig.2. Some temperature dependent ﬁtting parame-
ters are listed in Table I.

Among these ﬁtting parameters, the square of the plasma
frequency ω2
P is proportional to n/m∗, where n is the density
of free carriers and m∗ stands for the eﬀective mass of quasi-
particles. ωP is essentially a constant for temperatures above
100 K, but it drops sharply at 8 K. Assuming the carriers den-
sity n does not change with temperature, the eﬀective mass
can be estimated to be m∗ = 10.7mb, where mb is the corre-
sponding band mass. This value is a little bit higher than es-
timated from quantum oscillation measurement[14]. Further-
more, γD = 1/τD is the scattering rate of free carriers, which
is an order of magnitude larger at 100 K than 8 K. The large
γD at high temperature is attributed to strong scattering of con-
duction electrons by Ce 4 f local moments that ultimately are
screened by free carriers in the coherent state and act like itin-
erate quasiparticles.

For the Lorentz terms, ω j, γi = 1/τ j and S j represent the
resonance frequency, width and square root of the oscillator
strength, respectively. There are four nearly temperature inde-
pendent Lorentz term appearing at high energies, which stem
from interband excitations. We only display parameters for
the additional Lorentz term emerging at the lowest tempera-
ture, which is associated with the formation of hybridization
gap. The central frequency ω1 = 215 cm−1 (∼ 27 meV) can
be considered as the energy scale of the hybridization gap.
Compared with other members in the CemMnIn3m+2n family,
it is much smaller than that of CeCoIn5 and CeIrIn5 but is a
little bit larger than for CeRhIn5 and CeIn3 [20–23]. More-
over, the hybridization peak feature in the optical conductiv-
ity of CePt2In7 is much weaker than in CeCoIn5 and CeIrIn5
but is comparable with that in CeRhIn5 and CeIn3. Accord-
ing to Doniach’s model, the non-magnetic ground states of

3

CeCoIn5 and CeIrIn5 indeed suggest stronger hybridization
strength, and the relative weaker character of CePt2In7 is in
accord with its antiferromagnetic ordered ground state, which
reﬂects relatively weaker Kondo coupling in comparison with
the RKKY interactions between local moments being medi-
ated by conduction electrons.

ULTRAFAST PUMP PROBE MEASUREMENT

Because the hybridization gap structure detected by in-
frared spectroscopy is quite weak, we also performed time re-
solved pump-probe measurements on the same sample. This
measurement is very sensitive to the presence of low en-
ergy gaps and provides useful supplementary information. A
Ti:sapphire oscillator was utilized as the source of both pump
and probe beams and produces 800-nm laser pulses with 100
fs duration at a 80 MHz repetition rate. The pump beam
was modulated with a frequency of 1 MHz and polarized per-
pendicular to the probe beam. The pump ﬂuence is about 2
µJ/cm2, 10 times stronger than the probe pulses.

FIG. 3. The photoinduced transient reﬂectivity ∆R/R at several se-
lected temperatures. The data are smoothed for clarity.

Figure 3 shows the photoinduced reﬂectivity change ∆R/R
as a function of time delay at high (a) and low (b) temper-
atures. The transient reﬂectivity is initially enhanced due to
thermomodulation of the pump pulse that excites electrons to

empty states much higher than the Fermi energy and leaves
holes below. Then ∆R/R relaxes back to a ﬂat background
within several picoseconds. Above 24 K, this relaxation can
be well described by a single exponential decay ∆R/R = A
exp(−t/τ1), where A stands for the amplitude of the photoin-
duced reﬂectivity and τ1 is the relaxation time of the decay.
The ﬂat background cannot recover to equilibrium within our
measurement range of up to several hundreds of picosecond,
so it is most likely corresponding to a heat diﬀusion process
that usually takes several nanoseconds. It is clearly seen in
Fig.3 (a) that at high temperatures the magnitude of ∆R/R in-
creases monotonically with temperature cooling, whereas the
relaxation time is almost temperature independent. This is a
typical response of conventional metals and can be interpreted
by the phenomenological two-temperature model.
In this
model, the electrons are ﬁrst heated by the pump pulses and
establish a quasi-equilibrium state in tens of femtoseconds.
Thus, the transient temperature of the electron system Te be-
comes much higher than the lattice temperature TL. These hot
electrons transfer their excess energy to the lattice via slower
electron-phonon interactions, and the relaxation time of this
process is directly dependent on the electron-phonon coupling
constant λ.

Between the temperature range 100 K > T > 60 K, we ﬁnd
that ∆R/R remains nearly unchanged. With temperature fur-
ther deceasing below 60 K, both A and τ1 drop rapidly upon
cooling. Moreover, an additional decay channel with opposite
sign is clearly observed below 24 K, which provides strong
evidence for the renormalization of the electronic structure.
Here, two exponential functions are required to ﬁt the relax-
ation: ∆R/R = A exp(−t/τ1) + B exp(−t/τ2). We have ex-
tracted the relaxation time of the second decay channel from
an exponential ﬁtting. This relaxation time increases mono-
tonically with decreasing temperature and grows to be al-
most 6 times longer at the lowest temperature. The slowing
down of the relaxation time also has been demonstrated in
many other heavy fermion compounds, such as CeCoIn5[24],
Yb1−xLuxAl3[25], URu2Si2 [26] and so on[27, 28]. In these
materials, enhancement of the decay time is attributed to the
opening of hybridization gaps, which can be well explained
by the Rothwarf-Taylor (RT) model[29]. Below the Kondo
temperature, the photoexcited quasiparticles relax initially
through electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering to
states just above the hybridization gap, usually within sub-
picosecond time scale. The further combination of electron
and hole pairs across ∆HG generates high frequency phonons
(HFP) with energy ωHFP ≥ ∆HG, which subsequently break
more electron-hole pairs. This avalanche process severely im-
pedes the recovery of quasiparticles back to the equilibrium
states, leading to the well known phonon bottleneck eﬀect that
substantially increases the relaxation time.

According to the RT model, the temperature dependence of

the relaxation time follows[24, 30]:

τ−1(T ) = Γ[δ(ǫnT + 1)−1 + 2nT ],

decay channel. The blue solid curve is the result of ﬁtting to the RT
model.

rameters and nT represents the density of thermally excited
quasiparticles which is related to the energy scale of the low
√T exp(−∆g/2T ). We ﬁnd that τ2
energy gap ∆g via nT ≃
follows Eq. 2 quantitatively and the gap energy is determined
to be ∆g=140 K (∼ 13 meV), as shown by the solid curve
in Fig. 4. Note that ∆g is much smaller than ∆HG identiﬁed
by infrared measurements. Because optical spectroscopy is
responsive to direct charge excitations, whereas pump probe
techniques are sensitive to indirect interband transitions, the
latter is very likely to yield a smaller gap energy. For ex-
ample, similar results also are revealed in the heavy fermion
superconductor PuCoGa5 [31].

Another remarkable fact is that the monotonic increase of
the amplitude A upon cooling terminates around 100 K, which
is far away from the direct observation of two exponential
decays.
It is worth noting that the temperature dependent
resistivity also shows a downwards bending around 100 K.
Therefore, we propose that the hybridization gap begins to de-
velop just below this particular temperature, and the dropping
of A and τ1 is actually ascribed to the emergence of the ad-
ditional decay channel whose amplitude (B) is opposite that
of A. Upon lowering temperature, both B and τ2 should in-
crease due to the opening of the hybridization gap, although
it is too weak to be observed in the presence of relative large
A and τ1 above 24 K. In contrast, the relaxation dynamics
of CeCoIn5 follow a single exponential decay, and the ini-
tial electron-phonon coupling process is buried in the phonon
bottleneck signals[24]. Moreover, the relaxation time across
the hybridization gap in CeCoIn5 is enhanced by two orders
of magnitude upon cooling, much larger than in CePt2In7.
All these characters suggest that the hybridization strength of
CePt2In7 is rather weak, consistent with the infrared measure-
ment.

SUMMARY

In conclusion, we have performed infrared and ultrafast
pump probe measurements on the antiferromagnetic heavy
fermion compound CePt2In7. Upon entering the heavy
fermion coherence state, the optical conductivity reveals a
very weak hybridization gap feature with an energy of 27
meV. Concurrently, the Drude component shifts dramatically
to lower frequency because of the screening of local moments
and the spectral weight of it is substantially removed due to
enhancement of the eﬀective mass. Ultrafast pump-probe re-
veals an additional relaxation channel accompanied with the
development of the hybridization gap. The relaxation time of
this channel increases upon cooling until the lowest temper-
ature. This response agrees well with the expected behavior
of heavy electrons relaxing across a hybridization gap. The
energy scale of this indirect gap is extracted to be 13 meV,
much smaller that the direct gap identiﬁed by infrared mea-
surement. Although the presence of a hybridization is demon-
strated clearly in CePt2In7, its strength is much weaker than
in superconducting CeCoIn5 and CeIrIn5 but comparable with
that in the antiferromagnets CeIn3 and CeRhIn5. The results
imply that the AFM ground state of CePt2In7 can be ascribed
to its relatively weak hybridization strength.
