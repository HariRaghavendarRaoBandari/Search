CUBIC ARC-TRANSITIVE k-CIRCULANTS

MICHAEL GIUDICI, ISTV ´AN KOV ´ACS, CAI HENG LI, GABRIEL VERRET

Abstract. For an integer k > 1, a graph is called a k-circulant if its au-
tomorphism group contains a cyclic semiregular subgroup with k orbits on
the vertices. We show that, if k is even, there exist inﬁnitely many cubic
arc-transitive k-circulants. We conjecture that, if k is odd, then a cubic arc-
transitive k-circulant has order at most 6k2. Our main result is a proof of this
conjecture when k is squarefree and coprime to 6.

1. Introduction

All graphs in this paper are ﬁnite, simple and connected. A permutation group
is called semiregular if its only element ﬁxing a point is the identity. For an integer
k > 1, a graph is called a k-circulant if its automorphism group contains a cyclic
semiregular subgroup with k orbits on the vertices.

Clearly, every graph is a k-circulant for some k, for example if k is the order of
the graph. Moving beyond this trivial observation is often quite diﬃcult: whether
every vertex-transitive graph is a k-circulant for some other k is a famous open
problem (see [2, 20]). This question has been settled in the aﬃrmative for graphs
of valency at most four [8, 22].

On the other hand, studying k-circulants for ﬁxed k often yields interesting re-
sults. For example, 1-circulants, usually called simply circulants, are exactly Cayley
graphs on cyclic groups. These graphs have been intensively studied. The family
of 2-circulants (sometimes called bicirculants) has also attracted some attention.

In many cases, additional symmetry conditions are imposed on the graphs. In
particular, cubic arc-transitive k-circulants have been the focus of some recent in-
vestigation. (A graph is called arc-transitive if its automorphism group acts tran-
sitively on ordered pairs of adjacent vertices. A graph is cubic if each of its vertices
has degree 3.) It is a rather easy exercise to show that a cubic arc-transitive cir-
culant is isomorphic to either K4 or K3,3. The classiﬁcation of cubic arc-transitive
bicirculants can be deduced from [12, 21, 23], while cubic arc-transitive k-circulants
for k ∈ {3, 4, 5} are classiﬁed in [11, 16]. Rather than describe these classiﬁcations
in detail, we would simply like to point out one striking feature:
for k = 2 or
k = 4, there exist inﬁnitely many cubic arc-transitive k-circulants, whereas for
k ∈ {1, 3, 5}, there are only ﬁnitely many. This immediately suggests the following
question.

Question 1.1. Given a positive integer k, does there exist inﬁnitely many cubic
arc-transitive k-circulants?

Investigating this question is the main topic of this paper. Our ﬁrst result is

that the answer is positive when k is even.

Proposition 1.2. If k is an even positive integer, then there exist inﬁnitely many
cubic arc-transitive k-circulants.

We then turn our attention to the case when k is odd. We are unable to settle
Question 1.1 in full generality in this case, but we prove the following, which is our
main result.

Theorem 1.3. If k is a squarefree positive integer coprime to 6, then a cubic
arc-transitive k-circulant has order at most 6k2.

We would like to note that the methods used in the proof of Theorem 1.3 can,
with some more eﬀort, yield a complete classiﬁcation of cubic arc-transitive k-
circulants, for k squarefree coprime to 6. We also show that the bound of 6k2 in
Theorem 1.3 is best possible.

Proposition 1.4. If k is an odd positive integer, then there exists a cubic arc-
transitive k-circulant of order 6k2

Finally, in view of Theorem 1.3, Proposition 1.4 and computational evidence
gathered from the census of cubic arc-transitive graphs of order at most 10000 [4, 5],
we would like to propose the following conjecture which would completely settle
Question 1.1.

Conjecture 1.5. If k is an odd positive integer, then a cubic arc-transitive k-
circulant has order at most 6k2.

2. Proof of Proposition 1.2

Let k = 2m be an even positive integer and let p be a prime with p ≡ 1 (mod 3)

and p ∤ m. Let

G = hu, v, w, x | um, vm, wp, x2, [u, v], [u, w], [v, w], uxu, vxv, wxwi.

In other words, G is the generalised dihedral group on the abelian group A :=
hu, v, wi ∼= Z2
m×Zp. Since p ≡ 1 (mod 3), there exists a positive integer α satisfying
α2 + α + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p).

Let y be the automorphism of G satisfying uy = v, vy = u−1v−1, wy = wα, and

xy = x, and let s = uwx. Note that y has order 3 while s is an involution.

Let S = {s, sy, sy2

}, let R = hSi and let Γ be the Cayley graph Cay(R, S). It is
clear that Γ is connected and, since sy 6= s, we have |S| = 3 and thus Γ is cubic.
Since y has order 3, S is the orbit of s under hyi which implies that y induces an
automorphism of Γ ﬁxing the identity but acting transitively on S. In particular,
Γ is arc-transitive.

Let a = ssy and b = ssy2

. Note that a, b ∈ A thus as = ax = a−1 and
bs = bx = b−1. In particular, R = ha, b, si = ha, bi ⋊ hsi. Now, a simple calculation
yields that a = uv−1w1−α and b = u2vw1−α2
In particular, am = w(1−α)m.
Since p divides neither m nor 1 − α, it follows that w ∈ hai. This implies that
ha, bi = huv−1, u2vi × hwi = huv−1, u3i × hwi. In particular, |A : ha, bi| = 3 if 3
divides m and ha, bi = A otherwise. Similarly, |G : R| = 3 if 3 divides m and G = R
otherwise.

.

Let C be the group generated by u3w if 3 divides m and by uw otherwise. Note
that C 6 ha, bi 6 R and thus C is a semiregular subgroup of G. Since p is coprime
to m, C has order mp
In both cases, C has
3
2m = k orbits on the vertices of Γ and thus Γ is a k-circulant. To conclude the
proof, it suﬃces to note that there are inﬁnitely many primes p with p ≡ 1 (mod 3),
and p ∤ m.

if 3 divides m, and mp otherwise.

3. Proof of Proposition 1.4

Let

R = hu, v, x, y | uk, vk, x3, y2, [u, v], uxv−1, vxvu, uyv, vyu, xyxi.

Note that R = hu, vi ⋊ hx, yi ∼= Z2

k ⋊ Sym(3). Let

δ =(1, if 3 divides k,

0, otherwise,

and let σ be the automorphism of R such that uσ = u−1v−1, vσ = u, xσ = (uv)δx,
yσ = x2y, and let G = R ⋊ hσi. Note that one needs to check that σ is indeed an
automorphism of R. This is obvious when δ = 0 as, in this case, σ acts on R as
conjugation by x−1. Furthermore, even when δ = 1, σ still acts on hu, vi ⋊ hyi as
conjugation by x−1, hence one needs only check that the relations involving x are
preserved by σ. This is a straightforward computation. For example:

(uσ)xσ

= (u−1v−1)(uv)δ x = (u−1v−1)x = u = vσ.

It is also easy to check that xσ3
= x and thus σ has order 3. Let s = uvy,
let S = {s, sσ, sσ2
}, and let Γ = Cay(R, S). Note that s is an involution and
sσ = v−1x2y 6= s hence S is an inverse-closed set of cardinality 3 and Γ is a cubic
graph of order |R| = 6k2. Since S is a hσi-orbit, σ induces an automorphism of Γ
ﬁxing the identity but acting transitively on S. In particular, Γ is G-arc-transitive.
We now show that Γ is connected or, equivalently, that S generates R. Recall
that sσ = v−1x2y. An easy computation yields sσ2
= uδ−1xy. A more elaborate
computation then yields that ssσssσ2
= u3−δ ∈ hSi. From the deﬁnition of δ, it
follows that u ∈ hSi, but then us = v−1 ∈ hSi and we easily conclude that S
generates R. It remains to exhibit a semiregular cyclic subgroup of G of order 6k.
Suppose ﬁrst that 3 does not divide k and let C = huv−1yxσi. An easy compu-
tation shows that uv−1, y and xσ pairwise commute and have orders k, 2 and 3,
respectively. Since k is coprime to 6, it follows that |C| = 6k. It remains to show
that C is semiregular. Since |Gv| = 3, it suﬃces to show that hxσi is semiregu-
lar but, in fact, hxσi is central in G and thus must intersect every point-stabiliser
trivially.

Suppose now that 3 divides k and let C = hyσi. As yσ is not contained in R which
is a normal subgroup of index 3 in G, we get that |yσ| = 3|(yσ)3|. A computation
yields that (yσ)3 = v−1xy. Similarly, (yσ)3 is not contained in hu, vi ⋊ hxi which
is a normal subgroup of index 2 in R, and thus |(yσ)3| = 2|(yσ)6|. Now, (yσ)6 =
(v−1xy)2 = v−2u−1 and |v−2u−1| = k and thus |C| = |yσ| = 6k. It remains to
show that C is semiregular but, since |Gv| = 3, it suﬃces to show that h(yσ)2ki is
semiregular. Since 3 divides k, and R is normal of index 3 in G, we ﬁnd that (yσ)2k
is contained in the regular group R. This completes the proof.

4. Preliminaries to the proof of Theorem 1.3

We start with some notation and deﬁnitions. Let G be a group of automorphisms
of a graph Γ. We denote by Gv the stabiliser in G of the vertex v, by Γ(v) the
neighbourhood of v, and by GΓ(v)
the permutation group induced by the action of
Gv on Γ(v). We say that Γ is G-vertex-transitive (G-arc-transitive, respectively)
if G is transitive on the set of vertices (arcs, respectively) of Γ, and that it is
G-locally-transitive if GΓ(v)

is transitive for every vertex v.

steps apart. We say that Γ is (G, t)-arc-transitive if G is transitive on the set of
t-arcs of Γ.

Given an integer n and a prime p, we will sometimes denote by np the p-part of
n (that is, the largest power of p dividing n) and by np′ the p′ part (that is, n/np).
Given a graph Γ and N a group of automorphisms of Γ, the quotient graph Γ/N
is the graph whose vertices are the N -orbits, and with two such N -orbits vN and
uN adjacent whenever there is a pair of vertices v′ ∈ vN and u′ ∈ uN that are
adjacent in Γ. If the natural projection π : Γ → Γ/N is a local bijection (that is, if
π|Γ(v) : Γ(v) → (Γ/N )(vN ) is a bijection for every vertex v of Γ) then Γ is called a
regular N -cover of Γ/N . Such covers have many important properties that will be
used repeatedly, most of which are folklore. (See [24, Lemma 3.2] for example.)

We now collect a few results that will be useful in the proof.

Lemma 4.1. Let p be an odd prime, let P be a p-group with a maximal cyclic
subgroup and let X be the group generated by elements of order p in P .

(1) If P = X, then P is elementary abelian.
(2) If X is cyclic, then so is P .
(3) If P is cyclic of order at least p2, then an automorphism of P of order 2

centralising the maximal subgroup of P must centralise P .

Proof. These results easily follow from the classiﬁcation of p-groups with a cyclic
maximal subgroup (see for example [17, Section 5.3]).
(cid:3)

Lemma 4.2. Let G be a group with a normal subgroup N and let T be a perfect
group acting on G and centralising N . If T acts trivially on G/N , then it acts
trivially on G.

Proof. Since T acts trivially on G/N , we have [G, T ] 6 N and thus [G, T, T ] 6
[N, T ] = 1. Similarly, [T, G, T ] = 1. By the three subgroups lemma, it follows that
[T, T, G] = 1 and, since T is perfect, [T, G] = 1.
(cid:3)

Lemma 4.3. Let Γ be a graph with every vertex having odd valency and let C be a
semiregular cyclic group of automorphisms of Γ. If C has an odd number of orbits,
then C has even order and the unique involution of C reverses some edge of Γ.

Proof. Let (C1, . . . , Ck) be an ordering of the orbits of C and let A = {aij} be the
k × k matrix such that aij is the number of vertices of Cj adjacent to a given vertex
of Ci. It is not hard to see that this is independent of the choice of vertex, hence
A is well-deﬁned and, moreover, aij = aji hence A is symmetric.

By hypothesis, k is odd and the sum of every row and column is odd. In par-
ticular, the sum of all the entries of A is odd. On the other hand, A is symmetric
and thus the sum of the non-diagonal entries is even. This shows that at least one
diagonal entry of A, say ann, must be odd.

Let X be the graph induced on Cn. Since C is semiregular, it acts regularly on
X and we can view X as a Cayley graph Cay(C, S). Since X has odd valency, |S| is
odd, |C| is even and S contains the unique involution of C. The result follows. (cid:3)

Lemma 4.4. Let Γ be a G-arc-transitive group and let N be a normal subgroup
of G.
If N contains an element reversing some edge of Γ, then Γ is N -vertex-
transitive.

Proof. Let e be an edge of Γ. Since N is normal in the arc-transitive group G, N
must contain an element reversing e. In particular, the endpoints of e are in the
same N -orbit. By connectedness, N is vertex-transitive.
(cid:3)

Lemma 4.5. Let G be a transitive permutation group, let N be a normal subgroup
of G and let C be a semiregular subgroup of G with k orbits. If |N | is coprime to

|Gv|, then the induced action of C on the N -orbits is semiregular with k′ orbits,
where k′ divides k.

Proof. Since |N | is coprime to |Gv|, Nv = 1 and thus |N | = |vN | for every point v.
It follows that |(G/N )vN | = |G/N |

|Ω|/|vN | = |G|

|Ω| = |Gv|.

Let c ∈ C such that N c (viewed as an element of G/N ) ﬁxes some vN . For
the ﬁrst part, it suﬃces to show that cN is trivial. Note that, by the previous
paragraph, the order of N c divides |Gv|. On the other hand, since vN is ﬁxed by
N c, vN can be partitioned in hci-orbits, but these all have the same size, namely
|c|, and thus |c| divides |N |. It follows that the order of N c divides both |Gv| and
|N | but these are coprime and thus N c is trivial.

(cid:3)

that |N | = |vN | and thus k

Lemma 4.6. Let Γ be a G-arc-transitive graph. If G has a normal semiregular
subgroup with at most two orbits on vertices, then the subgroup of G ﬁxing a vertex
and all its neighbours is trivial.

Proof. If G has a normal regular group, then the result follows by [13, Lemma 2.1].
Otherwise, it is not hard to see that Γ must be bipartite and the result follows by
applying [18, Lemma 2.4] with X = G and N the bipartition-preserving subgroup
of G.
(cid:3)

Theorem 4.7. [25, 26] Let Γ be a cubic graph. If Γ is G-arc-transitive, then it is
(G, t + 1)-arc-regular for some 0 6 t 6 4. Moreover, the structure of Gv is uniquely
determined by t and is as in Table 1.

Proposition 4.8. [19, Corollary 4.6] Let Γ be a cubic (G, t+1)-arc-transitive graph.
If G is soluble, then t 6 2. Moreover, if t = 2, then Γ is a regular cover of K3,3.

Lemma 4.9. Let Γ be a cubic G-arc-transitive graph and let N be a normal sub-
group of G that is locally-transitive on Γ. If |Nv| 6 12, then |Gv| 6 12.

Proof. Suppose, by contradiction, that |Gv| > 12. By Theorem 4.7, Gv is isomor-
phic to either Sym(4) or Sym(4)×Z2. Now, Nv is a normal subgroup of Gv of order
divisible by 3. Since |Nv| 6 12, it is not hard to check that this implies Nv ∼= Alt(4).
Since N Γ(v)
is
regular of order 3. As N is normal in a vertex-transitive group, this holds for every
vertex, but this implies that Nv itself has order 3, a contradiction.

Lemma 4.10. Let Γ be a G-locally-transitive cubic graph. If N is a normal sub-
group of G such that G/N is insoluble, then N has at least three orbits and is
semiregular on the vertices of Γ. In particular, Γ is a regular cover of Γ/N .

Proof. If N has at most two orbits on vertices, then |G : N | divides 2|Gv|. Since
|Gv| is a {2, 3} group, so is G/N and thus G/N is soluble, a contradiction. If follows
that N has at least three orbits on vertices and, since G is locally-primitive, N must
be semiregular.

Note that, for an integer n, the property of having a cyclic group of index dividing
n is inherited by normal subgroups and quotients. This fact will be used repeatedly
throughout the paper.

Lemma 4.11. Let Γ be a cubic (G, t + 1)-arc-regular graph such that G is insoluble
and let S be the soluble radical of G.

(1) If C is a semiregular cyclic subgroup of G with an odd number of orbits,

then |C ∩ S| is odd and |G/S : CS/S|2|S|2 = 2t.

(2) If a Sylow 2-subgroup of G has a cyclic subgroup of index at most 2t, then

G/S is almost simple.

Proof. We ﬁrst prove (1). Suppose, by contradiction, that |C ∩ S| is even. This
implies that S contains the unique involution of C. By Lemmas 4.3 and 4.4, it
follows that S is vertex-transitive, contradicting Lemma 4.10. We conclude that
|C ∩ S| is odd. Note that |G/S : CS/S| = |G|/|CS| = |G||C ∩ S|/|S||C| =
3 · 2tk|C ∩ S|/|S|, where k is the number of orbits of C. Since |C ∩ S| is odd
it follows that |G/S : CS/S|2|S|2 = 2t. This concludes the proof of (1).

We now prove (2). By Theorem 4.7, we have 0 6 t 6 4. By Lemma 4.10, Γ
is a regular cover of Γ/S and Gv ∼= (G/S)vS . Let N be the socle of G/S. Write
N = T1 × · · · × Tm, such that the Ti’s are nonabelian simple and ordered such that
the exponent of their Sylow 2-subgroups is non-increasing. We suppose that m > 2
and will obtain a contradiction.

Let N2 be a Sylow 2-subgroup of N . Recall that the Sylow 2-subgroup of a
nonabelian simple group is never cyclic and, in particular, has order at least 4. Thus,
any cyclic subgroup of N2 has index at least 2|T2|2 · · · |Tm|2. On the other hand,
N2 has a cyclic subgroup of index at most 2t. It follows that 2t > 2|T2|2 · · · |Tm|2 >
2 · 4m−1. Since t 6 4, we have m = 2, |T2|2 6 8 and t > 3.

If N has at least three orbits on the vertices of Γ/S, then Γ/S is a regular cover
of (Γ/S)/N . By the Schreir Conjecture, (G/S)/N is soluble and thus t 6 2 by
Proposition 4.8, a contradiction. It follows that N has at most two orbits. If N is
semiregular, then it follows by Lemma 4.6 that t 6 1. We may thus assume that
N is locally-transitive.

We may thus apply Lemma 4.10 to conclude that Γ/S is a regular cover of
(Γ/S)/T1. In particular, N/T1 is locally-transitive. Since N/T1 ∼= T2, |T2|2 6 8
and (Γ/S)/T1 has even order, we ﬁnd that |(N/T1)v|2 6 4, where v is a vertex
in (Γ/S)/T1, and thus |NvS | = |(N/T1)v| 6 12. By Lemma 4.9, this implies
|Gv| = |(G/S)vS | 6 12 and thus t 6 2, a contradiction.
(cid:3)

Proposition 4.12. Let t be an integer with 0 6 4 6 t, let k be a squarefree positive
integer coprime to 6 and let G be an almost simple group with order divisible by 3.
If G has a cyclic subgroup C of even order and index dividing 3 · 2tk, then G, |C|
and log2 |G : C|2 are given in Table 2.

Proof. Let T be the socle of G. Note that |T : T ∩ C| divides 3 · 2tk, this will play
a crucial role.

If T ∼= Alt(n), then n < 9 since the Sylow 3-subgroup of G contains a cyclic
subgroup of index dividing 3. The cases n ∈ {5, 6, 7, 8} yield rows (1 − 6) of
Table 2.

Suppose now that T is a sporadic simple group (including the Tits group). By
considering the order of elements in T (see [6]), one can check that T does not have
a cyclic subgroup of index dividing 3 · 2tk unless T is isomorphic to the Matthieu
group M11 or the Janko group J1. Both of these have trivial outer automorphism
group, hence G = T and it is easy to check that C must be as in rows (7) and (8)
of Table 2.

characteristic r, say. We record the order and a crude upper bound on the exponent
of a Sylow r-subgroup of T in Table 3. The orders can be found in [6, p xvi], while
bounds for exponents are obtained by ﬁrst taking the smallest dimension n of an
irreducible representation of T (or some covering group) over a ﬁeld of characteristic
r from [15, Table 5.4C], and then using the fact that an r-element in GL(n, rf ) has
order at most re where e = ⌈logr n⌉ 6 (n + 1)/2 (see [14, §16.5] for example).

Recall that |T : T ∩ C| divides 3 · 2tk. In particular, a Sylow r-subgroup of T
must contain a cyclic subgroup of index at most r if r is odd and at most 16 if r = 2.
Using this fact and Table 3, we deduce that T is isomorphic to one of PSp(4, 2),
PSU(4, 2), PSL(4, 2), 2B2(8), PSU(3, rf ), or PSL(n, rf ) with n 6 3.

It can be checked that PSU(4, 2) and PSL(4, 2) do not contain a cyclic subgroup
of index dividing 3 · 2tk, whereas the case T ∼= PSp(4, 2) ∼= Sym(6) has already
been dealt with. The group 2B2(8) has order coprime to 3 but its automorphism
group yields row (9) of Table 2.

Suppose now that T is isomorphic to PSL(3, rf ) or PSU(3, rf ). A Sylow r-
subgroup of T has order r3f and exponent 22 if r = 2, and r otherwise. It follows
that r = 2 and f 6 2. It can be checked that no example arise when f = 2, while
PSU(3, 2) is soluble. Finally, we will deal with T ∼= PSL(3, 2) ∼= PSL(2, 7) as part
of our next and last case.

It remains to deal with the case T ∼= PSL(2, rf ). Since PSL(2, 2) and PSL(2, 3)
are soluble, PSL(2, 4) ∼= PSL(2, 5) ∼= Alt(5) and PSL(2, 9) ∼= Alt(6), we may assume
that rf > 7 and rf 6= 9. The Sylow r-subgroup of T has order rf and exponent r.
In particular, f 6 2 unless r = 2 in which case f 6 5.

It can be checked that when r = 2 and f ∈ {3, 4, 5}, the examples that arise are

in rows (10 − 14) of Table 2.

Suppose now that f = 1. In particular, r is odd and G = PSL(2, r) or G =
PGL(2, r). The orders of maximal cyclic subgroups of PSL(2, r) are (r + 1)/2,
(r − 1)/2 and r, while the orders of maximal cyclic subgroups of PGL(2, r) are
(r + 1), (r − 1) and r [7]. Since |C| is even, we get rows (15) and (16) of Table 2.
Finally, suppose that f = 2 and r > 5. Since k is squarefree and r2 divides
|PSL(2, r2)|, r must divide |PSL(2, r2)∩C|. On the other hand, a Sylow r-subgroup
S of PSL(2, r2) is elementary abelian hence |PSL(2, r2) ∩ C| = r. Moreover, for
each element c of order r in S, the centraliser of c in PGL(2, r2) is S [7]. Since |C|
is even, it follows that PΣL(2, r2) 6 G and |C| = 2r. Note that |PΣL(2, r2)|2 > 24
and |PΓL(2, r2)|2 > 25. This gives rows (17) and (18) of Table 2.

5. Proof of Theorem 1.3

In view of the statement of Theorem 1.3, we will consider the following hypoth-

esis.

Hypothesis 5.1. Let k > 5 be a squarefree integer coprime to 6 and let Γ be a
cubic (G, t + 1)-arc-regular graph such that C is semiregular with k orbits.

Our goal is to show that Γ has order at most 6k2. We introduce the following

notation which we will use whenever we assume Hypothesis 5.1.

Notation. For a prime p dividing |G|, we denote by Pp a Sylow p-subgroup of
G and by Cp a Sylow p-subgroup of C contained in Pp. (Note that we may have
Cp = 1.) Let c be the unique involution in C. (C has even order since Γ does but
k is odd.)

We denote by S the soluble radical of G and write G = G/S and C = CS/S.

Let T be the socle of G.

We ﬁrst note a few obvious facts about G and C that will be very useful.

Lemma 5.2. Assuming Hypothesis 5.1, the following holds.

(1) |G| = 3 · 2tk|C|.
(2) |P2 : C2| = 2t.
(3) For every odd prime p, we have that |Pp : Cp| divides p.

5.1. G Soluble. We ﬁrst focus on the case when G is soluble.

Lemma 5.3. Assume Hypothesis 5.1. If G is soluble, then t 6 1 and, for every
prime p, we have |Pp : Cp| 6 p.

Proof. By Lemma 5.2, it suﬃces to show that t 6 1. Suppose that t > 2. By
Proposition 4.8, t = 2 and Γ is a regular cover of K3,3.

Since G is soluble, Γ is a regular cover of Γ∗ which is itself a regular Za

q -cover
of K3,3 for some prime q and some integer a > 1. Since t = 2, it follows by [10,
Theorem 1.1] and [9, Theorem 4.1] that a > 4, or q = 3 and a 6= 2.

By Lemma 5.2, Pq has a cyclic subgroup of index dividing q or 4. In particular,
every elementary abelian section of Pq has rank at most 2, unless q = 2, in which
case it has rank at most 3. By the previous paragraph, we get that q = 3 and
a = 1 and, by [10, Theorem 1.1], Γ∗ is isomorphic to the Pappus graph. Since
t = 2 and the Pappus graph is 3-arc-regular, Aut(Γ∗) is a quotient of G. This is
a contradiction because the Sylow 3-subgroup of Aut(Γ∗) does not have a cyclic
maximal subgroup.
(cid:3)

Lemma 5.4. Assume Hypothesis 5.1, and let p > 5 be a prime dividing the order
of Γ. If Pp is normal in G then

(1) c does not centralise Pp, and
(2) |Pp : Cp| = p and |Cp| 6 p.

Proof. We ﬁrst prove (1). Suppose, by contradiction, that c centralises Pp. Let
Z be the centraliser of Pp in G. This is a normal subgroup of G. By the Schur-
Zassenhaus Theorem, we can write Z = Z(Pp) × Y where Y is a p′-group. Note
that Y is characteristic in Z and thus normal in G. Since p is odd, we have c ∈ Y .
By Lemmas 4.3 and 4.4, it follows that Y is transitive on the vertices of Γ, a
contradiction, as p divides the order of Γ. This concludes the proof of (1).

We now prove (2). By (1), Pp (cid:2) C and thus Lemma 5.2 implies |Pp : Cp| = p.

In particular, Pp is a p-group with a cyclic maximal subgroup.

Let X be the group generated by elements of order p in Pp. This is a character-
istic subgroup of Pp and thus normal in G. Suppose ﬁrst that X = Pp. The result
then follows by Lemma 4.1(1).

Suppose next that CpX < Pp. Since Cp is maximal in Pp, this implies that
X 6 Cp. It follows by Lemma 4.1(2) that Pp is cyclic. By (1), c centralises Cp but
not Pp and thus |Pp| = p by Lemma 4.1(3).

From now, we assume that X < Pp = CpX. This implies that 1 6= Pp/X 6
CX/X and thus Pp/X is a non-trivial normal Sylow p-subgroup of G/X. By
Lemma 4.5, Hypothesis 5.1 is satisﬁed with (k, Γ, G, C) replaced by (k′, Γ/X, G/X, CX/X)
for some divisor k′ of k. In particular, p divides the order of Γ/X and we may ap-
ply (1) to conclude that cX does not centralise Pp/X, contradicting the fact that
Pp/X 6 CX/X.
(cid:3)

Theorem 5.5. Assume Hypothesis 5.1. If G is soluble, then Γ has order at most
6k2.

Proof. By Lemma 5.3, every Sylow p-subgroup of G is metacyclic. It follows by [3,
Theorem 1] that G = N ⋊ A, where A is a Hall {2, 3}-subgroup of G and N has a
normal series

1 = N0 P N1 P · · · P Nn = N

where Ni+1/Ni ∼= Ppi . For every i ∈ {0, . . . , n}, |Ni| is coprime to 6 and thus
semiregular.
In particular, Γ is a regular cover of Γ/Ni and, by Lemma 4.5,
CNi/Ni is semiregular and has κi orbits on Γ/Ni for some divisor κi of k.
It
follows that (Γ/Ni, G/Ni) satisﬁes Hypothesis 5.1 with (k, Γ, G, t, C) replaced by

10

(κi, Γ/Ni, G/Ni, t, CNi/Ni). Note that Ni+1/Ni is a normal Sylow pi-subgroup of
G/Ni and we may thus apply Lemma 5.4 to conclude that |Cpi | 6 |Ppi : Cpi | = kpi .
Finally, k is coprime to 6 but G/Nn = G/N ∼= A is a {2, 3}-group and thus κn = 1.
It
Hence Γ/N is a cubic arc-transitive circulant and thus has order at most 6.
follows that |C2||C3| 6 6 hence |C| 6 6k, which concludes the proof.
(cid:3)

5.2. G not soluble. We now consider the remaining case, namely when G is not
soluble.

Lemma 5.6. Assume Hypothesis 5.1. If G is insoluble, then G, |C|, log2 |G : C|2
and upper bounds for t and log2 |S|2 are as in rows (1 − 8) or (15 − 18) of Table 2.

Proof. By Lemma 4.10, Γ/S is a cubic (G, t + 1)-arc-regular graph. In particular,
3 divides |G|. By Lemma 4.11, |C ∩ S| is odd, C is a cyclic group of even order and
G is an almost simple group. Recall that |G : C| = 3 · 2tk. By Proposition 4.12, G,
|C| and log2 |G : S| are as in one of the rows of Table 2.

We now compute upper bounds on t and record them in Table 2. We do this by
using the fact that the isomorphism type of the vertex-stabiliser GvS is uniquely
determined by t (see Theorem 4.7). For example, Alt(7) does not contain a subgroup
isomorphic to Sym(4)×Z2 and thus t 6 3 when G ∼= Alt(7). The fact that PSL(2, r)
does not contain a subgroup isomorphic to Sym(4) × Sym(2) follows from Dickson’s
classiﬁcation of the subgroups of PSL(2, r) [7].

We then combine this upper bound on t with Lemma 4.11(1) to obtain an upper
bound on log2 |S|2, which we also record in Table 2. (When log2 |G : C|2 > t, we
obtain a contradiction and record this as a –.)
(cid:3)

Theorem 5.7. Assume Hypothesis 5.1. If G is insoluble, then Γ has order at most
6k2.

Proof. By Lemma 5.6, G, |C|, log2 |G : C|2 and upper bounds for t and |S|2 are
as in Table 2. Write G = S.T.A. Note that G ∼= T.A and we can read oﬀ A from
In fact, |A| 6 2, unless G ∼= PΓL(2, r2), in which case |A| = 4. We
Table 2.
denote by G∞ the last term of the derived series of G. By the Schreier conjecture,
G∞ ∼= Y.T for some normal subgroup Y of S. Let

1 = S0 P S1 P · · · P Sn = S

be a maximal characteristic series for S. For every i ∈ {0, . . . , n − 1}, let φi : G →
Aut(Si+1/Si) and let Ki be the kernel of φi in G∞.

Suppose that φi(G∞) is insoluble for some i. Since Si+1/Si is characteristically
simple, it is elementary abelian, say Si+1/Si ∼= Za
p. By Table 2, |S|2 6 4. Together
with Lemma 5.2, this implies that a 6 2. Since φi(G∞) is insoluble, a = 2, p > 5
and Aut(Si+1/Si) ∼= GL(2, p). By Dickson’s classiﬁcation of subgroups of PSL(2, p)
[7], either SL(2, p) 6 φi(G∞) or SL(2, 5) 6 φi(G∞) 6 φi(G) 6 SL(2, 5) ◦ Zp−1. In
the latter case, G ∼= Alt(5) and |S| is even, contradicting Table 2. Thus SL(2, p) 6
φi(G∞) and T = PSL(2, p). By [1, Table I], an extension of Z2
p by SL(2, p) splits
hence G contains a group of order p3 and exponent p as a section, contradicting
Lemma 5.2.

It follows that G∞/Ki ∼= φi(G∞) is soluble for every i. Since G∞ is perfect,
it follows that G∞ = Ki and thus φi(G∞) = 1. Since this is true for every i ∈
{0, . . . , n − 1}, it follows by Lemma 4.2 and induction that G∞ 6 CG(S) and G∞ ∩
S 6 Z(G∞). On the other hand, Z(G∞) is an abelian normal subgroup of G hence
Z(G∞) 6 S and thus G∞ ∩ S = Z(G∞). In particular, G∞/Z(G∞) = G∞/(G∞ ∩
S) ∼= G∞S/S = T . Since T is simple, we conclude that G∞ is quasisimple. In
particular, Y is a subgroup of the Schur multiplier of T .

We want to show that the order of Γ is at most 6k2. This is equivalent to
|C| 6 6k = 6|G|
2t−1|C| and thus to |G| > 2t−1|C|2. On the other hand,
|C| = |C||C ∩ S| but |C ∩ S| is odd by Lemma 4.11(1) hence |C| 6 |C||S|2′ . Since
|G| = |G||S| > |G||S|2′ , it thus suﬃces to show that

|Gv||C| = |G|

(1)

|G| > 2t−1|C|2|S|2′ .

Suppose ﬁrst that G∞ is semiregular on the vertices of Γ. This implies that
|G/G∞|2 > 2t. On the other hand, G/G∞ ∼= (S/Y ).A hence |G/G∞|2 6 |S|2|A|.
Combining this with Lemma 4.11(1), we get |G/G∞|2|G : C|2 6 2t|A| 6 |G/G∞|2|A|
and thus |G : C|2 6 |A|. By running through Table 2, we ﬁnd that G ∼= PGL(2, r)
with r > 5 and |A| = |G : C|2 = 2. (Note that this includes the case G ∼= Sym(5).)
Using the previous inequalities, this implies that |G/G∞|2 = 2t and thus G∞ has
an odd number of orbits. Since G∞ is semiregular, it follows that it is transitive
hence |(S/Y ).A| = |G/G∞| = |Gv| = 3 · 2t and Lemma 4.6 implies t 6 1. Since
|A| = 2, we have t = 1 and |S/Y | = 3. On the other hand, since the Schur mul-
tiplier of PSL(2, r) has order 2, we see that |Y |2′ = 1 and thus |S|2′ = 3. Now,
|G| = (r + 1)r(r − 1) while |C| 6 r + 1 hence (1) is satisﬁed.

We may thus assume that G∞ is not semiregular on the vertices of Γ. In par-
ticular, G∞ is locally transitive and has at most two orbits on the vertices of Γ. It
follows that G/G∞ is a 2-group hence so is S/Y and thus |S|2′ = |Y |2′. Now, by
considering the Schur multiplier of T , we ﬁnd that |Y |2′ = 1 unless T is isomorphic
to Alt(6) or Alt(7), when we may have |Y |2′ = 3. It is then a matter of routine to
go through Table 2 and verify that (1) is satisﬁed.
