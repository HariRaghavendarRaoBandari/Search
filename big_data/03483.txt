Abstract. We consider the problem of non degenerate in energy metastable states forming
a series in the framework of reversible ﬁnite state space Markov chains. We assume that
starting from the state at higher energy the system necessarily visits the second one before
reaching the stable state. In this framework we give a sharp estimate of the exit time from
the metastable state at higher energy and, on the proper exponential time scale, we prove
an addition rule. As an application of the theory, we study the Blume–Capel model in the
zero chemical potential case.

Keywords: metastability, multiple metastable states, exit time, Probabilistic Cellular Au-
tomata, Blume–Capel model

1. Introduction

Metastable states in ﬁnite volume Statistical Mechanics lattice systems, in which stochas-
tic transition between states are controlled by an energy function, is a well understood
phenomenon. Diﬀerent mathematical theories have been developed in the last decades.

The pioneering pathwise approach [13, 19, 22, 23] and the more recent potential theoretic ap-
proach [4, 5, 24], further developed in [1] via the use of the trace process, allow a thorough
description of the phenomenon.

The ﬁrst theory gives a handy deﬁnition of the metastable state and a physically crystal
interpretation of the associated exit time. In the low temperature limit, it has been proven
indeed that the time scale on which the system leaves the metastable state is exponentially
large with the inverse temperature, with a mass given by the smallest energy barrier that the
system has to overcome along the paths connecting the metastable state to the stable state.
Moreover, the theory gives informations about the paths followed by the system during its
transition to the stable state. In particular it ensures that with high probability the system
visits one of the conﬁgurations, namely, the critical droplets, where the smallest energy
barrier is attained before reaching the stable state.

The latter theory, on the other hand, allows a precise estimate of the mean exit time. In
particular it is proven that, measured in terms of the exponential time scale, such a mean time
can be written in terms of a quantity, called capacity, which can be bounded from above and
from below by using eﬀective variational principles. Under suitable hypotheses on the energy
landscape, the theory allows the computation of the prefactor and, what is very relevant on
physical grounds, shows that it does depend on entropic eﬀects. Indeed, in many speciﬁc
models the prefactor has been computed explicitly and it results to be connected, loosely
speaking, to the number of possible ways in which the system can perform its transition to
the stable state [8,19]. More precisely, it depends on the number of critical droplets that the
system can use as a gate towards the stable state.

In this framework general results are proven under suitable hypotheses on the energy
landscape ruling out the possibility to have multiple non degenerate in energy metastable
states. In this paper we approach precisely such a problem and assume that two metastable
states are indeed present. Moreover, we chose a peculiar structure of the energy landscape
such that the two states form a “series”, in the sense that, starting from the metastable state
at higher energy, the system has to visit necessarily (in probability in the low temperature
limit) the second one in its way towards the ground state. We prove a sort of addition rule
for the exit time and compute, on the exponential scale, a sharp estimate for the exit time.
We approach this problem in the framework of rather general reversible Markov chains.
Our aim is that of introducing a model covering both the standard Statistical Mechanics
stochastic lattice models (e.g., the Metropolis dynamics) and the reversible Probabilistic
Cellular Automata. In this framework we assume a minimal characterization of the energy
landscape suﬃcient to ensure both the presence of two non degenerate in energy metastable
state and their serial structure.

In the last part of the paper we discuss an application of this theory. Indeed, we approach
the Blume–Capel model, whose metastability behavior has already been studied from dif-
ferent point of views and in diﬀerent limits in [12, 15, 18, 20], and we derive, with a diﬀerent
method, the same result recently proven in [18] on the sharp estimate of the exit time from
the metastable minus one state in the zero chemical potential case.

The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 the general model is introduced and our
main results are stated. Those results are then proved in Section 3. Finally, the application
to the Blume–Capel model is discussed in Section 4.

2. Model and results

In this section we ﬁrst introduce a general reversible Markov chain and specify the conditions
on the energy landscape in order to have a series of metastable states. We next state our
main results in this framework.

2.1. Reversible Markov chains

We want to give the notion of reversible Markov chain [23, Condition R, page 335] in a
quite general setup so that the theory will apply to diﬀerent and relevant examples such as
Statistical Mechanics Lattice models and the reversible Probabilistic Cellular Automata.

Consider a ﬁnite state space X and a family of irreducible and aperiodic Markov chain
x(t), with t ∈ Z+ parametrized by the parameter β > 0, called inverse temperature. We
let pβ(x, y) and µβ(x), for x, y ∈ X be respectively the transition matrix and the stationary
measure. We assume that the Markov chains are reversible with respect to µβ, namely,

(2.1)
for any x, y ∈ X. We also assume that the fact that a jump is not allowed does not depend
on β, namely, if pβ(cid:48)(x, y) = 0 then pβ(cid:48)(cid:48)(x, y) = 0 for any β(cid:48)(cid:48).

µβ(x)pβ(x, y) = pβ(y, x)µβ(y)

The deﬁnition of the model will be completed by assuming a slightly enforced version of
the well known Wentzel–Friedlin condition and by requiring that the stationary measure is
“close” to a Gibbs one. More precisely, we assume that there exists ∆ : X × X → R+ ∪{∞}
and r : X × X → R such that ∆(x, y) = ∞ for x, y ∈ X such that pβ(x, y) = 0 and
for x, y ∈ X such that pβ(x, y) > 0.

lim
β→∞
The fact the stationary measure is close to a Gibbs one at low temperature is generally valid in the
framework of Wentzell–Fridlin dynamics, see, e.g., [9, Proposition 4.1]. What we assume in this paper, see
(2.3), is, on the other hand, slightly stronger.

[− log pβ(x, y) − β∆(x, y)] = r(x, y)

(2.2)

pta˙10˙03˙2016˙arx.tex – 15 marzo 2016

2:02

µβ(x) =

1(cid:80)

y∈X e−Gβ (y)

e−Gβ (x) and

lim
β→∞

[Gβ(x)) − βH(x)] = s(x)

for x ∈ X

(2.3)

Note that ∆ and r do not depend on the inverse temperature. We shall call ∆ the cost
function.

Moreover, we assume that there exist two functions s, H : X → R and a family of

functions Gβ : X → R parametrized by β > 0 such that

and maxx∈X s(x) = ¯s < ∞. The normalization factor in µβ is denoted by Zβ and called

partition function. Note that the function H does not depend on the inverse temperature.
We shall call H the Hamiltonian or energy of the model.

From (2.2) and (2.3) it follows immediately that

1
β

lim
β→∞

and

log pβ(x, y) = −∆(x, y)

for x, y ∈ X such that pβ(x, y) > 0

Gβ(x) = H(x)

for x ∈ X.

1
β

lim
β→∞

From (2.1) and the conditions above it follows also that

H(x) + ∆(x, y) = ∆(y, x) + H(y)

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

for all x, y ∈ X.

For any x ∈ X, we denote by Px(·) and Ex[·] respectively the probability and the average

along the trajectories of the process started at x.

2.2. Examples

In this section we discuss two important examples of dynamics ﬁtting in the general scheme
depicted above. The Metropolis dynamics on the states space X with energy K : X → R,
inverse temperature β, and connection matrix q(x, y) is deﬁned by letting

pβ(x, y) = q(x, y) e−β[K(y)−K(x)]+

if x (cid:54)= y

(2.7)

where, for any real a, we let [a]+ = a if a > 0 and [a]+ = 0 otherwise be the positive part of
a, and

pβ(x, x) = 1 −(cid:88)

pβ(x, y).

It is well known that the Metropolis dynamics has as stationary measure the Gibbs
measure with Hamiltonian K, so that the condition (2.3) is satisﬁed with Gβ = βK and
s = 0.

y(cid:54)=x

pta˙10˙03˙2016˙arx.tex – 15 marzo 2016

2:02

Now, we let r(x, x) = 0 and r(x, y) = − log q(x, y) for x (cid:54)= y and q(x, y) > 0. For any
x (cid:54)= y, we let also ∆(x, y) = ∞ if q(x, y) = 0 and ∆(x, y) = [K(y) − K(x)]+ otherwise.
Finally, we let ∆(x, x) = ∞ if pβ(x, x) = 0 and ∆(x, x) = −(1/β) log pβ(x, x) otherwise. It
is immediate to verify that condition (2.2) is satisﬁed for any x, y ∈ X.

A second important example is that of reversible Probabilistic Cellular Automata (PCA).
Reversible PCA have been introduced in [17], see also [10] for a detailed discussion, and
provide a very interesting example of dynamics with a parallel updating rule which are
reversible with respect to a stationary measure which is very close to a Gibbs measure. The
metastable behavior of some reversible Probabilistic Cellular Automata has been studied
in [2, 11, 14].

Let Λ ⊂ Z2 be a ﬁnite cube with periodic boundary conditions. Associate with each site
i ∈ Λ the state variable xi ∈ {−1, +1} and denote by X = {−1, +1}Λ the state space. For
any x ∈ X we consider on {−1, +1} the probability measure

(2.8)

for s ∈ {−1, +1}, where β > 0 and h ∈ R are called inverse temperature and magnetic
ﬁeld respectively. The function k : Z2 → R is such that its support is a subset of Λ
and k(j) = k(−j) for all j ∈ Λ. Recall that, by deﬁnition, the support of the function k is
the subset of Λ where the function k is diﬀerent from zero. We assume, also, that

k(j − i)xj + h (cid:54)= 0

x ∈ X.

Thus, the reversible PCA satisﬁes condition (2.2) with ∆ = V and r(x, y) = 0 for any
x, y ∈ X.

For completeness, we ﬁnally prove (2.17).

yielding (2.17).

2.3. Energy landscape

After the short “intermezzo” on the Metropolis and the reversible PCA models, we come
back to the general setup of Section 2.1. Let Q be the set of pairs (x, y) ∈ X × X such that
pβ(x, y) > 0 or, equivalently, ∆(x, y) < ∞. The quaternion (X, Q, H, ∆) is then a reversible
energy landscape [12].

Given Y ⊂ X we let its external boundary ∂Y be the collection of states z ∈ X \ Y such
that there exists y ∈ Y such that (y, z) ∈ Q. In words, the external boundary is made of
those states outside Y such that there exists a state in Y where the system can jump.

Given Y ⊂ X such that H(y) = H(y(cid:48)) for any y, y(cid:48) ∈ Y , we shall denote by H(Y ) the
energy of the states in Y . For any Y ⊂ X we shall denote by F (Y ) the set of the minima
of the energy inside Y , that is to say y ∈ F (Y ) if and only if H(y(cid:48)) ≥ H(y) for any y(cid:48) ∈ Y .
We let Xs := F (X) be the set of ground states of H, namely, the set of the absolute minima
of the energy.

For any positive integer n, ω ∈ X n such that (ωi, ωi+1) ∈ Q for all i = 1, . . . , n − 1 is
called a path joining ω0 to ωn; we also say that n is the length of the path. For any path ω
of length n, we let

(2.18)
be the height of the path. For any y, z ∈ X we denote by Ω(y, z) the set of the paths joining
Since the energy landscape is reversible, the energy of the state ωn is implicitly taken into account in

[H(ωi) + ∆(ωi, ωi+1)]

Φω := max

i=1,...,n−1

(2.18), indeed (2.6) implies H(ωn) ≤ ∆(ωn−1, ωn) + H(ωn−1).

pta˙10˙03˙2016˙arx.tex – 15 marzo 2016

2:02

y to z. For any y, z ∈ X we deﬁne the communication height between y and z as

Φ(y, z) := min

ω∈Ω(y,z)

Φω

From (2.6), (2.18), and (2.19) it follows immediately that

for all y, z ∈ X. For any Y, Z ⊂ X we let

Φ(y, z) = Φ(z, y)

Φ(Y, Z) := min

ω∈Ω(Y,Z)

Φω = min
y∈Y,z∈Z

Φ(y, z)

(2.19)

(2.20)

(2.21)

where we have used the notation Ω(Y, Z) for the set of paths joining a state in Y to a state
in Z.

For any y, z ∈ X we deﬁne also the communication cost from y to z as the quantity
Φ(y, z) − H(y). Note that in general the communication cost from y to z diﬀers from that
from z to y.

2.4. Metastable states
For any x ∈ X we denote by Ix the set of states y ∈ X such that H(y) < H(x). Note that
Ix = ∅ if x ∈ Xs. We then deﬁne the stability level of any x ∈ X \ Xs

Vx := Φ(x, Ix) − H(x) ≥ 0

(2.22)

Note that the stability level Vx of x is the minimal communication cost that, starting from
x, has to be payed in order to reach states at energy lower than H(x).

Following [19] we now introduce the notion of maximal stability level. Assume X\Xs (cid:54)= ∅,

we let the maximal stability level be

Γm := sup
x∈X\Xs

Vx

We give the following deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition 2.1 We call metastable set Xm, the set:

Xm := {x ∈ X \ Xs : Vx = Γm}

(2.23)

(2.24)

Note that, since the state space is ﬁnite, the maximal stability level Γm is a ﬁnite number.
Following [19], that is to say by assuming the so called pathwise point of view, we shall call
Xm the set of metastable states of the system. Each state x ∈ Xm is called metastable.

pta˙10˙03˙2016˙arx.tex – 15 marzo 2016

8

2:02

A diﬀerent, even if strictly related, notion of metastable states is that given in [4] in
the framework of the Potential Theoretic Approach. First recall that the Dirichlet form
associated with the reversible Markov chain is deﬁned as the functional

µβ(y)pβ(y, z)[f (y) − f (z)]2

(2.25)

(cid:88)

Dβ[f ] :=

1
2

y,z∈X
where f : X → R is a generic function.

Thus, given two not empty disjoint sets Y, Z ⊂ X the capacity of the pair Y and Z can

be deﬁned as

capβ(Y, Z) := min

f :X→[0,1]

f|Y =1,f|Z =0

Dβ[f ]

(2.26)

Note that the capacity is a symmetric function of the sets Y and Z. It can be proven that
the right hand side of (2.26) has a unique minimizer called equilibrium potential of the pair
Y and Z and denoted by hY,Z.

A nice interpretation of the equilibrium potential in terms of hitting times can be given.
For x ∈ X and Y ⊂ X we shall denote by τ x
Y the ﬁrst hitting time to Y of the chain started
at x. Whenever possible we shall drop the superscript denoting the starting point from the
notation. Then, it can be proven that

 Px(τY < τZ)

1
0

hY,Z(x) =

for x ∈ X \ (Y ∪ Z)
for x ∈ Y
for x ∈ Z

(2.27)

where τY and τZ are, respectively, the ﬁrst hitting time to Y and Z for the chain started at
x. It can be proven that, for any Y ⊂ X and z ∈ X \ Y ,

capβ(z, Y ) = µβ(z)Pz(τY < τz)

see [3, equation (3.10)].
Deﬁnition 2.2 A set M ⊂ X is said to be p.t.a.–metastable if

lim
β→∞

maxx /∈M µβ(x)[capβ(x, M )]−1
minx∈M µβ(x)[capβ(x, M \ {x})]−1 = 0

(2.28)

(2.29)

The preﬁx p.t.a. stands for potential theoretic approach. We used this expression in order
to avoid confusion with the set of metastable states Xm introduced in (2.24). The physical
meaning of the above deﬁnition can be understood once one remarks that the quantity
µβ(x)/capβ(x, y), for any x, y ∈ X, is strictly related to the communication cost between the
states x and y, see Proposition A.1. Thus, condition (2.29) ensures that the communication

pta˙10˙03˙2016˙arx.tex – 15 marzo 2016

9

2:02

cost between any state outside M and M itself is smaller than the communication cost
between any two states in M . In other words, it states that getting to M starting from any
state outside M is “much” easier than going from any point in M to any other point in M .

Finally, given a p.t.a.–metastable set M ⊂ X, for any x ∈ M we let
Py(τz = τM )}

A(x) := {y ∈ X : Py(τx = τM ) = sup
z∈M

(2.30)
be the valley associated with x. For any y ∈ X and any z ∈ M the quantity Py(τz = τM )
measures the probability that, starting from y, the system touches M for the ﬁrst time in
Py(τz = τM ), one detects the best way to touch M for the
z. Thus, by computing supz,∈M
Py(τz = τM ) selects all the
system started at y. Hence, the condition Py(τx = τM ) = supz,∈M
sites y such that, for the system started at y, the best way to touch M is that of touching
it for the ﬁrst time at x.

2.5. Series of metastable states

The aim of this paper is that of proving an addition formula for the exit time from metastable
states in the case in which they form a series. With this expression we mean that the structure
of the energy landscape is such that the system has two non degenerate in energy metastable
states and the system, started at the one having higher energy, must necessarily pass through
the second one before relaxing to the stable state. See Fig. 2.1 for a schematic description of
the situation we have in mind and that will be formalized through the following conditions.

Condition 2.3 Recall (2.23) and (2.24).We assume that the energy landscape (X, Q, H, ∆)
is such that there exist three states x2, x1, and x0 such that Xs = {x0}, Xm = {x1, x2}, and
H(x2) > H(x1).

Note that, by recalling the deﬁnition of the set of ground states Xs, we immediately have

that

H(x1) > H(x0)

(2.31)

Moreover, from the deﬁnition (2.23) of maximal stability level it follows that (see [12, The-
orem 2.3]) the communication cost from x2 to x0 is equal to that from x1 to x0, that is to
say

Φ(x2, x0) − H(x2) = Φ(x1, x0) − H(x1) = Γm

(2.32)

Note that, since x2 is a metastable state, its stability level cannot be lower than Γm. Then,
recalling that H(x2) > H(x1), one has that Φ(x2, x1) − H(x2) ≥ Γm. On the other hand,
(2.32) implies that there exists a path ω ∈ Ω(x2, x1) such that Φω = H(x2) + Γm and, hence,
Φ(x2, x1) − H(x2) ≤ Γm. The two bounds ﬁnally imply that

Φ(x2, x1) − H(x2) = Γm

Φ(x0, x2) − H(x0) > Γm

and Φ(x1, x2) − H(x1) > Γm

(2.34)

Indeed, by recalling the reversibility property (2.20) we have

Φ(x1, x2) − H(x1) = Φ(x2, x1) − H(x2) + H(x2) − H(x1) = Γm + H(x2) − H(x1) > Γm

where in the last two steps we have used (2.33) and Condition 2.3, which proves the second
of the two equations (2.34). The ﬁrst of them can be proved similarly.

We want to implement in the model the series structure depicted in Fig. 2.1. With this
we mean that when the system is started at x2 with high probability it will visit x1 before
x0. For this reason we shall assume the following condition.

Condition 2.4 Condition 2.3 is satisﬁed and there exists κ > 0 and β0 > 0 such that for
any β > β0

Px2(τx0 < τx1) ≤ e−βκ

(2.35)

We remark that the Condition 2.4 is indeed a condition on the equilibrium potential hx0,x1
evaluated at x2.

The most important goal of this paper is that of proving the formula (2.40) for the
expectation of the escape time τx0 for the chain started at x2. Such an expectation, hence,
will be of order exp{βΓm} and the prefactor will be that given in (2.40). At the level of
logarithmic equivalence, namely, by renouncing to get sharp estimate, this result can be
proven by the methods in [19]. More precisely, one gets that (1/β) log Ex2[τx0] tends to Γm
in the large β limit. In order to prove (2.40) we indeed need something more,

In fact, we need an exponential control of the tail of the distribution of the distribu-
tion of the suitably rescaled random variable τx0, similar to (3.7) in [19] (see Section 3

therein). Unfortunately this condition is proven under strong assumptions on the Markov
chain (Metropolis dynamics). For this reason we assume in this paper such a property as a
condition that will have to be proven when our theory will be applied to concrete models.

Condition 2.5 Condition 2.3 is satisﬁed and for any δ > 0 there exists β0 > 0 and such
that

t Px2(τx0 > teβΓm+βδ) ≤ 1

(2.36)

for any β > β0.

We can thus formulate the further assumptions that we shall need in the sequel in order to
discuss the problem from the point of view of the Potential Theoretic Approach.

such that

2.6. Main results

We shall prove the addition rule for the exit times from the metastable states by using the
sharp estimates provided by the Potential Theoretic Approach to metastability originally
developed in [4].
Theorem 2.7 Assume Conditions 2.3 is satisﬁed. Then {x0, x1, x2} ⊂ X is a p.t.a.–
metastable set.

By means of the theory in [4] it is possible to write asymptotic estimates of the ﬁrst
hitting time to a subset of a p.t.a.–metastable set when the dynamics is started in state of
the same p.t.a.–metastable set not belonging to the considered subset. These results, see for
instance [4, Theorem 1.3], are typically proven under suitable not degeneracy conditions [4,
Deﬁnition 1.2] that are not satisﬁed in our case, due to the presence of multiple metastable
states. In the following theorem we state two results that, for the reasons outlined above,
can be deduced directly from those in [4]. On the other hand, as we shall discuss in detail in
Section 3, they can be deduced by some of the results proven in [3] (see, also, [5]). But, since
we assumed strong hypotheses on the energy landscape of the model, it will be possible to
prove the theorem directly by means of simple estimates. This “ad hoc” proof is also given
in Section 3.

3. Proof of results

In this section we proof the theorems stated above and related to the general setup given in
Section 2.5.

Proof of Theorem 2.7. The theorem follows immediately by Condition 2.3, (2.33), and [12,
(cid:3)
Theorem 3.6].

We just note that the Theorem 3.6 in [12] has been proved in a slightly diﬀerent context,

but the proof given there applies also to the more general case studied here.

Theorem 2.8 can be deduced by using the structure provided by Theorem 2.7 above, and
the general results [3, Eq. (4.14) and Lemma 4.3]. Alternatively, one can use [5, Eq. (8.1.6),
Eq. (8.3.3), and Lemma 8.13]. Since we assumed strong hypotheses on the energy landscape
of the model, it is possible to prove directly equation (2.38) by means of simple estimates.
Before discussing such a proof we state two useful lemmas. Recall Condition 2.3, in the ﬁrst
of the two lemmas we collect two bounds to the energy cost that has to be payed to go from
any state x (cid:54)= x1 to x1 or to x0. The second lemma is similar.
Lemma 3.12 Assume Condition 2.3 is satisﬁed. For any x ∈ X and x (cid:54)= x1. If H(x) ≤
H(x1), we have that

Φ(x, x0) − H(x) < Γm

and

Φ(x, x1) − H(x1) ≥ Γm

(3.2)

2:02

Proof. Let us prove the property (3.1) ﬁrst. By Theorem 2.3 in [12] we have that Φ(x, x0) ≤
Γm + H(x). If by absurdity Φ(x, x0) = Γm + H(x) then, by the same Theorem 2.3 in [12],
x ∈ Xm which is in contradiction with Condition 2.3.

As regards the proof of (3.2) we distinguish two cases. Case H(x) < H(x1): we have that

x ∈ Ix1. By Deﬁnition 2.1 of metastable state and by (2.22), we get

Φ(x1, x) ≥ Φ(x1, Ix1) = Γm + H(x1)

that proves (3.2).

Case H(x) = H(x1): let us deﬁne the set

C := {y ∈ X : Φ(y, x1) < H(x1) + Γm}

and show that x (cid:54)∈ C. Since H(x) = H(x1), the identity Ix = Ix1 follows. Furthermore,
being x1 ∈ Xm, we have C ∩ Ix1 = ∅; hence, C ∩ Ix = ∅ as well. Moreover, if x ∈ C then
Vx = Φ(x, Ix) − H(x) ≥ H(x1) + Γm − H(x) = Γm. By the Deﬁnition 2.1, x would be a
metastable state, in contradiction with Condition 2.3. Hence, since x (cid:54)∈ C, we have that

Φ(x, x1) ≥ Γm + H(x1)

that proves (3.2).

(cid:3)

Lemma 3.13 Assume Condition 2.3 is satisﬁed. For any x ∈ X and x /∈ {x2, x1, x0}. If
H(x) ≤ H(x2), we have that

and

Φ(x,{x1, x0}) − H(x) < Γm

Φ(x, x2) − H(x2) ≥ Γm

(3.3)

(3.4)

Proof. Let us prove the property (3.3) ﬁrst. By Theorem 2.3 in [12] we have that Φ(x,{x1, x0}) ≤
Φ(x, x0) ≤ Γm + H(x). If by absurdity Φ(x, x0) = Γm + H(x) then, by the same Theorem 2.3
in [12], x ∈ Xm which is in contradiction with Condition 2.3.

As regards the proof of (3.4) we distinguish two cases. Case H(x) < H(x2): we have that

x ∈ Ix2. By Deﬁnition 2.1 of metastable state and by (2.22), we get

Φ(x2, x) ≥ Φ(x2, Ix2) = Γm + H(x2)

that proves (3.4).

Case H(x) = H(x2): let us deﬁne the set

and show that x (cid:54)∈ C. Since H(x) = H(x2), the identity Ix = Ix2 follows. Furthermore,

Vx = Φ(x, Ix) − H(x) ≥ H(x2) + Γm − H(x) = Γ. By the Deﬁnition 2.1, x would be a
metastable state, in contradiction with Condition 2.3. Hence, since x (cid:54)∈ C, we have that

that proves (3.4).

(cid:3)

Φ(x, x2) ≥ Γm + H(x2)

Proof of Theorem 2.8. We prove in details the right of equation (2.38). The proof is based
on Lemma 3.12. The equation on the left can be deduced with precisely the same arguments
and using the bounds in Lemma 3.13. The only general results used is the representation of
the expected mean time in terms of the Green function given in [4, Corollary 3.3] (see also
equation (3.18) in the proof of the Theorem 3.5 in [4] or [16, Eq. (4.29)]). Indeed, recalling
(2.28) above, we have:

(cid:88)

Ex1[τx0] =

1

capβ(x1, x0)

x∈X

µβ(x) hx1,x0(x)

(3.5)

Considering the contribution of x1 in the sum and recalling (2.27), we get the following lower
bound:

Ex1[τx0] ≥

1

cap(x1, x0)

µβ(x1)hx1,x0(x1) =

µβ(x1)

(3.6)

cap(x1, x0)

In order to provide un upper bound, we ﬁrst use the boundary conditions in (2.27) to rewrite
(3.5) as follows:

Ex1[τx0] =

1

cap(x1, x0)

µβ(x)hx1,x0(x) +

µβ(x)hx1,x0(x)

x∈X\x0,

H(x)≤H(x1)

x∈X\x0,

H(x)>H(x1)

Recalling that hx1,x0(x1) = 1, the equilibrium potential is not bigger than one, the conﬁgu-
ration space is ﬁnite, and µβ(x) = µβ(x1) exp{−βδ} for some positive δ and for any x ∈ X
such that H(x) > H(x1), we get

Ex1[τx0] =

1

cap(x1, x0)

µβ(x) hx1,x0(x) + µβ(x1)[1 + o(1)]

Ex1[τx0] ≤

cap(x1, x0)

Which implies

By (2.27) and (A.2) we can give the following upper bound for the equilibrium potential

hx1,x0(x), for any x (cid:54)= x1, x0:

Thus, if H(x) ≤ H(x1), we have

hx1,x0(x) ≤ cap(x, x1)

are suitable positive constants.

(3.8)

where we have used that the conﬁguration space is ﬁnite. The Theorem ﬁnally follows by
(cid:3)
(3.6) and (3.8).

Proof of Theorem 2.9. The theorem follows immediately by exploiting Condition 2.6 and
(cid:3)
applying Theorem 2.8.

The proof of Theorem 2.10 is organized in a sequence of Lemmas. We will write the

desired expectation as sum of three terms that we shall control separately.
Lemma 3.14 Given three states y, w, z ∈ X pairwise mutually diﬀerent, we have that the
following holds

Proof. First of all we note that

To get a lower bound we use the representation of the expected mean time in terms of

the Green functions given in [4, Corolloary 3.3]. More precisely we write

µβ(y)hx2,{x1,x0}(y)
capβ(x2,{x1, x0})

hx1,x0(y)

y∈X\{x1,x0}

and bound the lefthand side by the term of the sum on the righthand side corresponding to
y = x2, that is to say we write

Ex2[τx1

Condition 2.4, the ﬁrst of the two equations (2.37), and Proposition A.2. The Lemma ﬁnally
(cid:3)

4. Application to the Blume–Capel model

In this section, as a possible application of the theory described above, we apply our results
to the case of the Blume–Capel which has two metastable states non degenerate in energy.
We shall then derive, in a diﬀerent way, the results already appeared in [18].

Let us consider a squared lattice Λ ⊂ Z2 with periodic boundary conditions and side
length L. Let {−1, 0, +1} be the single spin state space and X := {−1, 0, +1}Λ be the
conﬁguration space. The Hamiltonian of the model [12] is
(σ(i) − σ(j))2 − h

(cid:88)

(cid:88)

H(σ) =

(4.1)

σ(i)

for any σ ∈ X , where the ﬁrst sum is extended to the pairs of nearest neighbors and h ∈ R
is the magnetic ﬁeld. We denote by µβ the corresponding Gibbs measure

(cid:104)i,j(cid:105)

i∈Λ

µβ(σ) = exp{−βH(σ)}/

exp{−βH(η)}

(cid:88)

η∈X

with inverse temperature β. We shall study the zero chemical potential Blume–Capel model
for the following choice of the parameters: the magnetic ﬁeld h and the torus Λ are such
that 0 < h < 1, 2/h is not integer, and |Λ| ≥ 49/h4 ﬁnite, where, for any positive real a, we
let (cid:98)a(cid:99) be the largest integer smaller than or equal to a.

The time evolution of the model is deﬁned by the Metropolis Markov chain σt with
t = 0, 1, . . . the discrete time variable, see Section 2.2, with Hamiltonian H and connectivity
matrix

q(σ, η) :=

1/(2|Λ|)

if σ, η diﬀer at more than one site,

.

As already remarked in Section 2.2, the dynamics above is an example of the dynamics
deﬁned in Section 2.1, provided we let i) r(x, x) = 0 and r(x, y) = − log q(x, y) for x (cid:54)= y
and q(x, y) > 0; ii) for any x (cid:54)= y, ∆(x, y) = ∞ if q(x, y) = 0 and ∆(x, y) = [H(y) − H(x)]+
otherwise; iii) ∆(x, x) = ∞ if pβ(x, x) = 0 and ∆(x, x) = −(1/β) log pβ(x, x) otherwise. The
notation introduced in Section 2.1–2.4 is then trivially particularized to the Blume–Capel
case.

Given V ⊂ Λ and σ ∈ X , we let σV be the restriction of σ to V , namely, σV ∈ {−1, +1}V

such that σV (i) = σ(i) for any i ∈ V .

We let u ∈ X to be the conﬁguration such that u(i) = +1 for all i ∈ Λ. Other two
very relevant conﬁgurations are d and 0, that is the conﬁguration in which all the spin are
minus one and the one in which all the spins are zero. Note that in these conﬁgurations the
exchange part of the energy is minimal, although the magnetic part is not.

We now deﬁne the critical length of the model as

which are zeros, in a rectangle of sides long (cid:96)c and (cid:96)c − 1 and in a site adjacent to one of the

In order to give a result in the spirit of Theorem 2.10 in the case of the Blume–Capel
model, we ﬁrst have to prove preliminary Lemmas ensuring that the Conditions assumed
in the general discussion in Section 2.5 are satisﬁed in the Blume–Capel case. The Lem-
mas 4.19–4.21 will be proven in Section 4.2 below.

In this section we collect some deﬁnitions that will be used in the proof of the Lemmas 4.19–

Λs(σ) := {x∈ Λ : σ(x) = s}

(4.10)
for any σ ∈ X with s ∈ {−1, 0, +1}. Recall L denotes the side length of the squared lattice
Λ. Let x = (x1, x2) ∈ Λ; for (cid:96)1, (cid:96)2 positive integers we let Rx
be the collection of the

sites(cid:0)(x1 + n1) mod L, (x2 + n2) mod L(cid:1) for ni = 0, . . . , xi + (cid:96)i − 1 where i = 1, 2. Roughly

(cid:96)1,(cid:96)2

(cid:96)1,(cid:96)2

speaking, Rx
is the rectangle on the torus of side lengths (cid:96)1 and (cid:96)2 drawn starting from x
and moving in the positive direction along the two coordinate axes. For (cid:96) a positive integer
we let Qx

R(cid:96)1,(cid:96)2+1 depending if D ∈ {E, W} or D ∈ {N, S}.

Given a conﬁguration in σ0 ∈ C(cid:96)1,(cid:96)2(n; D) with n ≥ 1 a standard growing path is a path
(σ0, σ1, . . . , σk) such that σi+1 is obtained by enlarging by one zero spin the protuberance
in σi and σk is the rectangular envelope of σ0. Note that k = (cid:96)1 − n and k = (cid:96)2 − n if
D ∈ {E, W} or D ∈ {N, S}, respectively.

Given a conﬁguration in σ0 ∈ C(cid:96)1,(cid:96)2(n; D) with n ≥ 1 a standard shrinking path is a path
(σ0, σ1, . . . , σk) such that σi+1 is obtained by ﬂipping to minus one of the zero spins of the
protuberance having at most two neighboring minuses and σk is the conﬁguration obtained
by ﬂipping to minus all the spin in the protuberance of σ0.

In case of a stripe winding around the torus, i.e. (cid:96)1 ∨ (cid:96)2 = L, we use the same notation
adopted for the rectangular droplets: R(cid:96)1,(cid:96)2 is the set of the σ ∈ X which are either horizontal
stripes of zeroes in a see of minus if (cid:96)1 = L or vertical stripes if (cid:96)2 = L. Moreover, we denote
with Cx
(n) the conﬁguration obtained by adding a zero protuberance of length n to any
of the two sides of the stripe with length smaller than L.

Recall the deﬁnition of path in the conﬁguration space given just above (2.18). A path
ω = (ω1, . . . , ωm) ∈ X m is downhill if and only if H(ωi) ≥ H(ωi+1) for any i = 1, . . . , m − 1.
We say that a conﬁguration σ ∈ X is a local minimum of the Hamiltonian if and only if
H(η) ≥ H(σ) for any η ∈ X such that (σ, η) ∈ Q. For our purposes it is useful to introduce
the notion of strict downhill path by saying that a path ω = (ω1, . . . , ωm) ∈ X m is strict
downhill if and only if H(ωi) > H(ωi+1) for any i = 1, . . . , m− 1 and σm is a local minimum
of the Hamiltonian.

4.2. Proof of the lemmas concerning the Blume–Capel model
Proof of Lemma 4.19. By [12, Theorem 4.10] Xm = {d, 0} and Γm = Γc. By direct inspection
of the Hamiltonian (4.1) it follows that Xs = {u} and H(u) > H(0) (see, also, the comments
(cid:3)
below [12, Condition 4.7]).

The proof of Lemma 4.20 needs the discussion of some preliminary results aimed to
describe the paths followed by the system when it performs the transition from d to 0.
The ﬁrst step is that of computing energy diﬀerences between conﬁgurations diﬀering for
a single spin. Such a diﬀerence will depend only on the conﬁguration in a cross–shaped
neighborhood centered at the site with diﬀering spins. Thus, for any x ∈ Λ, we denote with
V (x) the neighborhood of x deﬁned as V (x) = {y ∈ Λ : d(x, y) ≤ 1}, where d(·,·) is the
Euclidean distance on the torus. Given a conﬁguration σ, the eﬀect on the Hamiltonian
of a change of the spin at site x will depend only on the conﬁguration σV (x) obtained by
restricting σ to V (x) (see, the deﬁnition of restriction given above (4.2)). All the possible
cases are summarized in the Table 4.2, where the conﬁgurations A1, A2, A3, B1, . . . , O3 are
listed and the corresponding diﬀerence of energies are reported.

We state and prove now the following Lemma regarding enlarging a protuberance of a

rectangular droplet following the energy drift.

Lemma 4.25 Given σ ∈ C(cid:96)1,(cid:96)2(1), any strict downhill path started at σ is either a standard
shrinking or growing path.
Proof. Let us start considering the case (cid:96)1 ∨ (cid:96)2 < L, i.e. proper rectangular droplets. Given
σ ∈ C(cid:96)1,(cid:96)2(1), by table 4.2 we deduce that for any y ∈ Λ, the restriction of σ to the cross
neighbor V (y) is such that

σV (y) ∈ {A1, B1, B2, D1, D2, G2, I2}

(4.12)
For any i ∈ Λ we denote with Hi(η), the contribution of the site i to the energy H(η),
j:|j−i|=1(η(i) − η(j))2 − hσ(i), where the sum is over the nearest–neighbor

i.e. Hi(η) := (cid:80)

sites of i. Consider, now, a strict downhill path (ω1, . . . , ωk) started at σ. Since in a strict
downhill path at each step there is one single spin which is ﬂipped, we have that for any
m ∈ {1, . . . , k − 1} there exists a site im ∈ Λ and sm ∈ {−1, 0, +1} \ {ωm(im)} such that

H(ωm+1) − H(ωm) = Him(Sim

sm

ωm) − Him(ωm)

By (4.12) we have that (ω1)V (x1) ∈ {A1, B1, B2, D1, D2, G2, I2} and, by Table 4.2, it follows
immediately that

(4.13)

 = −2 + h if (ω1)V (x1) = B2 and s1 = −1,

if (ω1)V (x1) = D1 and s1 = 0,
otherwise.

= −h
> 0

H(ω2) − H(ω1)

Therefore, a strict downhill path will either remove the protuberance (i.e., (ω1)V (x1) = B2

and s1 = −1) or enlarge by one zero the existing one (i.e., (ω1)V (x1) = D1 and s1 = 0).

In the ﬁrst case ω2 ∈ R(cid:96)1,(cid:96)2. Since (ω2)V (y) ∈ {A1, B1, D2, G2, I2} for any y ∈ Λ, by
Table 4.2 it follows that ω2 is a local minimum of the Hamiltonian. Hence, in this ﬁrst case,
the standard shrinking sequence is found.

In the second case, i.e., when the protuberance is enlarged, for any y ∈ Λ, (ω2)V (y) ∈
{A1, B1, D1, D2, G2, I2}. Notice that there are not anymore neighbors of type B2, because
the protuberance, now, is at least wide two sites. Hence, if we use the same argument used
for ω1, we deduce that the only way of lowering the energy is by enlarging the protuberance
along the side. We can repeat the same argument until all the line is ﬁlled. In this way the
standard growing sequence is found.

(cid:96)1 ∨ (cid:96)2 = L, the proof is almost identical, with only minor
adjustments: for instance in the set (4.12) is not present anymore the neighborhood D2. (cid:3)

In case of stripes, i.d.

Recall the deﬁnition of external boundary given in Section 2.3 and note that in the
Blume–Capel case the external boundary of a subset of the conﬁguration space is made of

all those conﬁgurations not belonging to such a set and such that by changing the value of
one single spin the conﬁguration that is obtained belongs to the set. We call a nonempty set

Aζ = {σ ∈ X : Φ(ζ, σ) < H(ζ) + 2 − h}

stays below H(ζ)+2−h. The following lemma gives a precise characterization of the minima
of the energy of the external boundary of the cycle Aζ for any ζ ∈ R(cid:96)1,(cid:96)2 with (cid:96)1, (cid:96)2 ≥ (cid:96)c, see

droplet. Let ζ ∈ R(cid:96)1,(cid:96)2. As we have noted in the proof of Lemma 4.25 we have that
ζV (i) ∈ {A1, B1, D2, G2, I2}, for any i ∈ Λ. This implies that (see Table 4.2) the rectangular
droplet ζ is a local minimum of the Hamiltonian. Moreover, by using the results in the table
one has that

H(Si

sζ) − H(ζ) ≥ 2 − h

(4.18)
for any i ∈ Λ excepted for the case of the corner erosion, namely, for i equal to one of the
four sites such that ζV (i) = D2 and s = −1. In these cases Hi(Si
sζ) − Hi(ζ) = h. Hence, all
the ﬂips but the corner erosion yield a conﬁguration outside Aζ. In particular, we remark
that the equality 2−h is attained by adding a protuberance to the rectangular conﬁguration,
i.e. Si

0ζ ∈ C(cid:96)1,(cid:96)2(1). This implies that C(cid:96)1,(cid:96)2(1) ⊆ argminη∈∂Aζ

Let us give the following deﬁnitions. Given a conﬁguration η, we deﬁne the 0–rectangular
envelope the conﬁguration R(η) such that Λ0(R(η)) is the smallest rectangle containing

H(η).

Λ0(η), where Λ0(·) is deﬁned in (4.10). Furthermore, we will call corner–erosion the spin
ﬂip from 0 to −1 in the site i with neighborhood V (i) of type D2. Moreover, we deﬁne the
set of conﬁgurations:

Ξ1 := {σ ∈ S : ∃i ∈ Λ s.t ζV (i) = D2, σ = Si

−1(ζ), R(σ) = ζ}

(4.19)

in words, Ξ1 is the set of all the conﬁgurations obtained from ζ by a corner–erosion. We
note that for any σ ∈ Ξ1, i ∈ Λ we have that σV (i) ∈ {A1, B1, D1, D2, G2, I2}. By inspection
of Table 4.2, it follows that if σV (i) ∈ {A1, B1, D1, G2, I2}:

so that Si

−1σ ∈ Aζ, that gives a second corner–erosion. This suggests the following deﬁnition,

and Si
for any k ≥ 2:

Ξk := {η ∈ S : ∃i ∈ Λ, ∃γ ∈ Ξk−1 s.t. γV (i) = D2, η = Si

−1(γ), R(η) = ζ}

(4.20)

−1σ ∈ Ξ2.

In words Ξk is the set of all the conﬁgurations obtained by ζ with k corner–erosions. Notice
that Si

H(γ) = k h + H(ζ) < (2/h + 1 − 2)h + H(ζ) = 2 − h + H(ζ), where we used (cid:96)c := (cid:98) 2

We show now that if k ≤ (cid:96)c − 2 then Ξk ⊆ Aζ. If γ ∈ Ξk, then we have indeed that
h(cid:99) + 1.
If k ≤ (cid:96)c − 3, for any γ ∈ Ξk, i ∈ Λ we have that γV (i) ∈ {A1, B1, D1, D2, G2, I2}. Again,
by inspection of Table 4.2, it follows that, for i ∈ Λ such that γV (i) ∈ {A1, B1, D1, G2, I2}:

H(Si

sγ) − H(ζ) > 2 − h

s(γ) ∈ ∂Aζ \ argminη∈∂Aζ

and Si
H(ζ) > 2 − h for s = +1, while for s = −1 we have:

H(η). If i is such that γV (i) = D2, we have that H(Si

so that Si

−1(γ) ∈ Aζ. In words, from γ ∈ Ξk any spin–ﬂip that is not corner–erosion increses
the energy by more than 2− h. Using similar arguments as above, for any γ ∈ Ξ(cid:96)c−2 and for
any i ∈ Λ we have that γV (i) ∈ {A1, B1, D1, D2, G2, I2}. If γV (i) ∈ {A1, B1, D1, G2, I2}, we
get:

so that Si
the corner–erosion, increases the energy by more than 2− h. This conclude the proof of item
i), since we proved that C(cid:96)1,(cid:96)2(1) ⊆ argminη∈∂Aζ
H(η) and for any other path the conﬁguration
reached when exiting Aζ does not belong to argminη∈∂Aζ
Item ii). Starting from ζ by (cid:96)c − 2 corner–erosions, it is not possible to change the
rectangular envelope, since (cid:96)1 and (cid:96)2 are not smaller than (cid:96)c. Furthermore, for any γ ∈ Ξk,
with k ≤ (cid:96)c− 2, every sites belonging to the rectangular envelope Λ0(R(γ)) is such that there
are at least other two neighboring sites with spin zero. By the proof of item i), we have that
sζ for j ∈ Λ and s ∈ {−1, 0, +1},
starting from ζ, all the possible spin ﬂipped conﬁgurations Sj

any η ∈ Ξk, with k ≤ (cid:96)c− 3, all the possible spin ﬂipped conﬁgurations Si

analyze all the paths joining ζ to η with η ∈ Aζ and we get that ωk(cid:48) ∈(cid:83)(cid:96)c−2

k=1 Ξk ∪ ζ, with
k(cid:48) ≤ (cid:96)c − 2. Therefore in any line and row of Λ0(η) there are at lest two sites with spin 0.
Thus, we have that

sη for i ∈ Λ and s ∈ {−1, 0, +1}, belongs either to Ξ2 ∪ {ζ} or to Ac

Since H(Ξk) > H(ζ), for k ≤ (cid:96)c − 2, the item follows.

In case of stripes, i.e. (cid:96)1 ∨ (cid:96)2 = L, the proof is simpler. In fact it is not possible anymore
to erode a corner: we have that ζV (i) ∈ {A1, B1, G2, I2}, for any i ∈ Λ. This implies that
(see Table 4.2)

Hence, all the ﬂips yield a conﬁguration outside Aζ.

Lemma 4.27 For any ζ ∈ R(cid:96)c−1,(cid:96)c+1, it holds: i) B(Aζ) is made by the conﬁgurations in
C(cid:96)c−1,(cid:96)c(1) obtained by ﬂipping to zero all the spins but one on one of the two shortest side
of the zero droplet in ζ; ii) F (Aζ) = ζ.

Figure 4.4: Energy landscape and construction of T0(d)

We ﬁnally come to the proof of Lemma 4.20. Our strategy is similar to the one used in
[Lemma 3.13, [21]]. We let T0(d) be the collection of the following trivial and non–trivial
pairwise disjoint cycles (see Fig. 4.4):

1. D0(d) := {η ∈ X : Φ(η, d) − H(d) < Γc},
2. all the conﬁgurations in Pc,
3. the non–trivial cycles Aζ for ζ ∈ R(cid:96)1,(cid:96)2 with min{(cid:96)1, (cid:96)2} ≥ (cid:96)c and max{(cid:96)1, (cid:96)2} ≤ L − 2;

4. any conﬁguration obtained by adding a 0 protuberance of length (cid:96) to one side of
ζ ∈ R(cid:96)1,(cid:96)2 with min{(cid:96)1, (cid:96)2} ≥ (cid:96)c and max{(cid:96)1, (cid:96)2} ≤ L − 3, and such that (cid:96)1 − (cid:96) ≥ (cid:96)c
(respectively (cid:96)2 − (cid:96) ≥ (cid:96)c) if the protuberance has been added to the side with length
(cid:96)1 (respectively (cid:96)2);

5. any conﬁguration obtained by ﬂipping to zero the spins associated with any nearest
neighbor connected subset of the set of sites adjacent to the shortest sides of any
rectangular droplet ζ ∈ R(cid:96)1,(cid:96)2 such that (cid:96)c ≤ min{(cid:96)1, (cid:96)2} ≤ L − 3 and max{(cid:96)1, (cid:96)2} =
L − 2;

6. any conﬁguration obtained by ﬂipping to zero the spins associated with any nearest
neighbor connected subset of the set of sites adjacent to either the horizontal or vertical
sides of any rectangular droplet ζ ∈ R(cid:96)1,(cid:96)2 such that (cid:96)1 = (cid:96)2 = L − 2;
A subset A of the torus Λ is said to be nearest neighbor connected if and only if for any x, y ∈ A there

exists a sequence of pairwise nearest neighbor sites of A such that the ﬁrst is x and the last is y.

8. any conﬁguration diﬀerent from 0 obtained by ﬂipping to zero the spins associated

tuberance of length one the side long (cid:96)c − 1 of any rectangle ζ ∈ R(cid:96)c−1,(cid:96)c;

10. the non–trivial cycles Aζ for ζ ∈ R(cid:96)c−1,(cid:96)c+1.
The T0(d) satisﬁes the following properties: 0 /∈ T0(d), u /∈ ∂T0(d) ∪ T0(d), there exists
B(C) ⊂ (cid:91)

a cycle C ∈ T0(d) such that 0 ∈ B(C), and for any cycle C ∈ T0(d)

D ∪ {0}

(4.23)

where it is useful to emphasize that T0(d) is a collection of pairwise disjoint cycles.

D∈T0(d)

The ﬁrst two properties are immediate by deﬁnition. We comment brieﬂy on the last two.
At step 6 in the deﬁnition of T0(d) we added in particular the conﬁgurations in which all the
spins on the lattice are equal to zero but one which is equal to minus one. It is immediate
to realize that the principal boundary of such a trivial cycle is the set {0}. Finally, to
prove equation (4.23) one has to examine all the cycles included in T0(d) and prove that
their principal boundaries are subset of the right hand side of equation (4.23). With the
same labelling used in the costruction of the set T0(d) we have: 1. by the methods of proof
of [12, Lemma 4.12] we have that B(D0(d)) = Pc∪Pc(cid:48). 2. for any ζ ∈ Pc the set B(ζ) is made
of the conﬁgurations obtained by enlarging by one site the protuberance; those conﬁgurations
belong to the not trivial cycles added at step 3. 3. from item i) in Lemma 4.26 it follows that
the principal boundary of the cycle Aζ is made by the conﬁgurations obtained by adding
a protuberance to one of the four sides of the rectangle ζ; these conﬁgurations are added
at steps 4 and 5; 4. consider the conﬁguration ζ and suppose the protuberance is on the
side of length (cid:96)1 (the argument is analogous in the other case), then B(ζ) is made of the
conﬁgurations obtained by enlarging by one site the protuberance; those conﬁgurations are
either trivial cycles added to T0(d) at step 4 or elements of the not trivial cycles added at
step 3. 5. consider the conﬁguration ζ and assume that it is not a stripe wind around the
torus, then B(ζ) is made of the conﬁgurations obtained by ﬂipping to zero any minus spin
with precisely two neighboring zeros; those conﬁgurations are added to T0(d) at step 5. On
the other hand, if ζ is a stripe winding around the torus the principal boundary is the set

32

2:02

of conﬁgurations obtained by adding a zero protuberance; those conﬁgurations are added to
T0(d) at step 7. The discussion of the other cases is similar. We just discuss explicitly the
case 10: by Lemma 4.27 we have that the principal boundary of the cycle Aζ is made of
the conﬁgurations obtained by ﬂipping to minus all the spins but one spin of one of the two
shortest sides of the rectangular droplet ζ; those conﬁgurations are elements of Pc(cid:48).
Lemma 4.28 Consider the set T0(d). Then there exists κ > 0 such that for β suﬃciently
large:

Pd(τ∂T0(d) < τ0) ≤ e−βκ

where in the ﬁrst equality we have used the fact that for each cycle C in T0(d) the principal
boundary B(C) is contained in T0(d); the ﬁrst inequality follows from the strong Markov
(cid:3)
property and the second inequality is a consequence of [23, Theorem 6.23].

Proof of Lemma 4.20. Since d ∈ T0(d), 0 ∈ ∂T0(d) and u /∈ T0(d) ∪ ∂T0(d), we have that,

Pd(τu < τ0) ≤ Pd(τ∂T0(d) < τ0) .

The lemma then follows from Lemma 4.28.

(cid:3)

Proof of Lemma 4.21. Under the assumption of Metropolis dynamics, we have an exponential
control of the tail of the distribution (see, [19, equation (3.7)]). Hence, there exists C > 1
such that

Px(τu > teβ(Γc+δ)) < C−t

with C > 1 and for β large enough. The lemma then follows.

Proof of Lemma 4.22. The proof of this lemma could be given by applying Proposition
2.3 and equation (5.1) in [18], correcting by a factor 2|Λ| for passing from the continuos to
the discrete time of the Metropolis dynamics. For the sake of completeness, we provide an

alternative proof, based on Theorem B.1 contained in Appendix B. By [12, Lemma 4.9], we
have that Φ(d,{0, u}) = Φ(d, u) = Γc + H(d). Moreover, by [12, Theorem 4.14], we know
that the minimal gates W between d and u is Pc. Hence, by Theorem B.1,

with ˇp(z) = 1/(2|Λ|), since the only possible transition to W is removing the protuberance

the corner and ˆp(z) = 1/|Λ| otherwise. So that,

Proposition A.1 ([6, Lemma 3.1.1]) Consider the Markov chain deﬁned in Section 2.1.
For every not empty disjoint sets Y, Z ⊂ X there exist constants 0 < C1 < C2 < ∞ such
that

C1 ≤ eβΦ(Y,Z) Zβ capβ(Y, Z) ≤ C2

(A.1)

for all β large enough.

Proof. The upper bound can be obtained by choosing f = IK(Y,Z) in (2.26) with

K(Y, Z) := {x ∈ X \ Y : Φ(x, Y ) ≤ Φ(Y, Z)}

For any pair u, v ∈ X such that u ∈ K(Y, Z) and v ∈ X \ K(Y, Z), we have that H(u) +
∆(u, v) ≥ Φ(Y, Z). In fact, if by absurdity it were H(u) + ∆(u, v) < Φ(Y, Z), it would be
possible to construct a path ω starting at v and ending in Y such that Φω < Φ(Y, Z), which
is in contradiction with v ∈ X \ K(Y, Z). Hence, by (2.25) and (2.26)

Recalling (2.2) and (2.3), we get that there exists C such that for β large enough

Finally, the upper bound in (A.1) follows from the fact that H(u) + ∆(u, v) ≥ Φ(Y, Z) for
any u ∈ K(Y, Z) and v ∈ X \ K(Y, Z).

u∈K(Y )
v∈X\K(Y )

As regards the lower bound, it can be obtained by picking any path ω = (ω0, ω1, . . . , ωn)
that realizes the minimax in Φ(Y, Z) and ignore all the transitions that are not the path
and using the same argument as in the proof of [Lemma 3.1.1, [6]]. An alternative proof
can be given applying the Berman–Konsowa lemma [Proposition 2.4, [7]] which provides a
complementary variational principle, in the sense that any test ﬂow will give a lower bound.
Hence, the lower bound can be obtained by picking any path ω = (ω0, ω1, . . . , ωn), with ω0 ∈
Y , ωn ∈ Z, such that it realizes the minimax in Φ(Y, Z) and such that H(ωi) + ∆(ωi, ωi+1) ≤
Φ(Y, Z) for i ∈ {0, . . . , n − 1} (recall (2.18) and (2.21)). If we choose a unitary ﬂow for the
edges in the path ω and null otherwise, the induced Markov chains is a deterministic chain
along the path, so that the expectation in [Proposition 2.4, [7]] is just the contribution of
the deterministic path. Hence, for the chosen ﬂow we have:

Proposition A.2 Consider the Markov chain deﬁned in Section 2.1. We have that

Py(τy1 < τy2) ≤ capβ(y, y1)
capβ(y, y2)

(A.2)

for any y (cid:54)= y1, y1 (cid:54)= y2, y (cid:54)= y2, and y, y1, y2 ∈ X.

Proof. Given y, y1, y2 ∈ X, a renewal argument and the strong Markov property yield:
Py(τy1 < τy2) = Py(τy1 < τy2, τ{y1,y2} > τy) + Py(τy1 < τy2, τ{y1,y2} < τy)

= Py(τy1 < τy2|τ{y1,y2} > τy)Py(τ{y1,y2} > τy) + Py(τy1 < τy2, τ{y1,y2} < τy)
= Py(τy1 < τy2)Py(τ{y1,y2} > τy) + Py(τy1 < τy2, τy1 < τy)
= Py(τy1 < τy2)Py(τ{y1,y2} > τy) + Py(τy1 < τ{y2,y})

Therefore

Py(τy1 < τy2) =

Py(τy1 < τ{y2,y})
1 − Py(τ{y1,y2} > τy)

=

Py(τy1 < τ{y2,y})
Py(τ{y1,y2} < τy)

≤ Py(τy1 < τy)
Py(τy2 < τy)

Recalling (2.28), we can rewrite the ratio in terms of ratio of capacities:

Py(τy1 < τy)
Py(τy2 < τy)

=

capβ(y, y1)
capβ(y, y2)

Hence, we get (A.2).

(cid:3)

B. Capacity estimate for Metropolis dynamics

In this section we state and prove a slightly more general theorem than Theorem 6.19 of [19].
As in [19], the theorem holds for the Metropolis dynamics introduced in Section 2.2, but in
the more general setting of two metastable conﬁgurations. We assume that Condition 2.3
holds so that the energy landscape is such that there exist three states x2, x1, and x0 such
that Xs = {x0}, Xm = {x1, x2}, and K(x2) > K(x1). This theorem gives indeed the capacity
between a conﬁguration x ∈ {x2, x1} and a set A = {x0, x1} \ {x} in terms of the energy
and cardinality of the minimal gates. Hence, the theorem considers the two case x = x2,
A = {x1, x0} and x = x1, A = {x0}.

For x and A as above we let Qx := {y ∈ X : Φ(y, x) < Φ(x, A)} and QA := {y ∈ X :
Φ(y, A) < Φ(x, A)}. By Deﬁnition 2.1 and Condition 2.3 we have that QA is a cycle and
QA ∩ Qx = ∅.

Before stating the theorem we recall ﬁrst some notions introduced in [19]. Let z ∈ X and
B ⊂ X. We say that S(z, B) ⊂ X is the set of saddles for the pair z and B if and only if

pta˙10˙03˙2016˙arx.tex – 15 marzo 2016

36

2:02

K(z) = Φ(z, B) for any z ∈ S(z, B). We say that a set W ⊆ S(z, B) is a gate for the pair z
and B if for any path ω ∈ Ω(z, B) such that Φω = Φ(z, B) we have that W ∩ ω (cid:54)= ∅. A gate
W for the pair z and B is said to be minimal if and only if for any proper subset W(cid:48) of W
there exists a path joining z to B with maximal height equal to the communication height
between z and B which does not pass through W(cid:48).
Theorem B.1 In the setup introduced above, consider x ∈ {x2, x1} and A = {x0, x1}\{x}.
Assume that the minimal gate W for x and A is unique and that for any y ∈ W and
w /∈ Qx ∪ QA we have p(y, w) = o(1). Then

Upper bound. By (2.28), [19, Theorem 5.4] and using the strong Markov property, we can

write:

capβ(x, A) = µβ(x)

In fact we have:

(cid:88)

z∈W

Px(τz < τW\z, τz < τx)Pz(τA < τx)(1 + o(1))

(B.3)

capβ(x, A) = µβ(x)Px(τA < τx) = µβ(x)Px(τA < τx, τW < τA)[1 + o(1)]

(B.4)

where in the ﬁrst equality we used the fact that p(z, y) = o(1) for any y ∈ (Qx∪QA∪{z})c; in
the last step, we have used the trivial relation Py(τA < τx) ≤ 1 for bounding the ﬁrst term of
the sum, while the upper bound for the second term follows from Py(τA < τx) ≤ Py(τ∂Qx < τx)
and from the recurrence of non trivial cycle (i.e. by Theorem 6.3 in [23], for any y ∈ Qx we
have Py(τ∂Qx < τx) = o(1)). Hence, by (B.4) and (B.3) we have:

Lower bound. In order to prove the lower bound, we adapt to our setting the arguments
of the proof in [8, Lemma 3.2]. We consider a subgraph ∆ in the space of conﬁgurations
obtained removing all the connections to the conﬁgurations in ∂Qx \ W. We denote with

(cid:101)Px the probability along the trajectories of this restricted process started at x. Hence, by

Rayleigh’s shortcut rule (see [8, Lemma 4.2]) we have:

If we now exploit the property of the restricted process we can write:

capβ(x, A) ≥(cid:103)capβ(x, A)
(cid:88)

(cid:101)Px(τz < τW\z, τz < τx)(cid:101)Pz(τA < τx)

Now, the ﬁrst factor in (B.8) can be rewritten as

˜pβ(z, y)(cid:101)Py(τx < τW) =
1 − ˜hx,W(y) = ˜hW,x(y) ≤ (cid:103)capβ(y,W)(cid:103)capβ(y, x)

We want to prove that inside Qx the equilibrium potential ˜hx,W(y) is exponentially close to
1. Therefore, for any y ∈ Qx, and for δ = Φ(x, A) − K(y) > 0:

equal, by construction, to p(z,·) of the original chain, for any z ∈ W. For the second factor
