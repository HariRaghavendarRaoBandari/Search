Our consistent eﬀort to unravel the mystery of super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs
(WDs), by exploiting the potential of magnetic ﬁelds, has brought this topic consid-
erable attention. This is also evident from the recent surge in the corresponding liter-
ature. In the present work, by means of full-scale general relativistic magnetohydrody-
namic (GRMHD) numerical analysis, we conﬁrm the existence of stable, highly magne-
tized, signiﬁcantly super-Chandrasekhar WDs having mass exceeding 3 solar mass. We
have explored various possible ﬁeld conﬁgurations, namely, poloidal, toroidal and mixed,
by self-consistently incorporating the departure from spherical symmetry induced by
a strong magnetic ﬁeld. Such super-Chandrasekhar WDs can be ideal progenitors of
peculiar, over-luminous type Ia supernovae.

1. Introduction

With the aim of obtaining a fundamental basis behind the formation of super-
Chandrasekhar white dwarfs (WDs), Mukhopadhyay and his collaborators 1–6 ini-
tiated the exploration of highly magnetized WDs and their new mass-limit, sig-
niﬁcantly exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.44M⊙. 7 These WDs are ideally
suited to be the progenitors of peculiar, overluminous, type Ia supernovae, e.g.
SN 2003fg, SN 2006gz, SN 2007if, SN 2009dc, 8,9 which are best explained by invok-
ing the explosion of super-Chandrasekhar WDs having mass 2.1 − 2.8M⊙. Along
with the fact that several WDs have been discovered with surface ﬁelds 105 − 109
G, it has also been known that magnetized WDs tend to be more massive than
their non-magnetized counterparts. 10 Such observations motivate the theoretical
investigation of the eﬀect of a strong interior magnetic ﬁeld on the mass of a WD.
In this context, we mention that our previous attempts at obtaining highly mag-
netized super-Chandrasekhar WDs, assumed a priori spherical symmetry. While
that may indeed be the case for certain magnetic ﬁeld geometries, in general, highly
magnetized WDs tend to be deformed due to magnetic tension. With each new step
we have scientiﬁcally progressed towards a more rigorous model — starting from
a simplistic Newtonian, spherically symmetric, constant ﬁeld model and culminat-
ing in a model with self-consistent departure from spherical symmetry by general

relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) formulation, which we explain in the
present work (also, see Ref. 11). We appropriately modify the XNS code, 12,13
which has so far been used only to model strongly magnetized neutron stars, to
compute equilibrium conﬁgurations of static, strongly magnetized WDs in the GR
framework, for the ﬁrst time in the literature to the best of our knowledge.

2. Numerical set-up

For a detailed description of the underlying GRMHD equations, the magnetic ﬁeld
geometries, the numerical technique employed by the XNS code and the values of
various code parameters, we refer the readers to Refs. 11-13.

We construct axisymmetric WDs in spherical polar coordinates (r, θ, φ), to self-
consistently account for the deviation from spherical symmetry due to a strong
magnetic ﬁeld, which generates an anisotropy in the magnetic pressure. 14 A uniform
computational grid is used along both the radial r and polar θ co-ordinates, the
number of grid points being typically Nr = 500 and Nθ = 100 respectively. Even
higher resolution runs (for e.g. with Nr = 1000 and Nθ = 500) require more
computational time but do not lead to any signiﬁcant change in the results.

In this work, we focus on the equilibrium solutions of high density, magnetized,
relativistic WDs, which can be described by a polytropic equation of state (EoS)
P = KρΓ, where P is the pressure and ρ the density, such that the adiabatic index
Γ ≈ 4/3 and the constant K is same as that obtained by Chandrasekhar. 7 Hence,
we neglect the possible eﬀect of Landau quantization on the above EoS which could
arise due to a strong magnetic ﬁeld B > Bc, where Bc = 4.414×1013 G, is the critical
magnetic ﬁeld. 1 We recall that the maximum number of Landau levels νm occupied
by electrons in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld is given by equation (10) of Ref. 1.
The range of central density and maximum magnetic ﬁeld strength inside the WDs
considered in this work are 1010 . ρc . 1011 gm/cm3 and 1013 . Bmax . 1015 G
respectively. Consequently, νm & 20 for this range of ρc and Bmax, which is large
enough not to signiﬁcantly modify the value of Γ we choose, hence justifying our
assumption.

3. Results with diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations

We now explore the eﬀect of various magnetic ﬁeld geometries on the structure and
properties of WDs. For a ﬁducial model, we choose a non-magnetized WD with
ρc = 2 × 1010 gm/cm3. It has a baryonic mass M0 = 1.416M⊙ and equatorial radius
Req = 1221.94 km, and is perfectly spherical with Rp/Req = 1, Rp being the polar
radius (note that for the deﬁnitions of all global physical quantities characterizing
the solutions in this work, we refer to Appendix B of Ref. 13).

Figures 1(a) and (c) portray the distribution of baryonic density and magnetic
ﬁeld strength respectively, for the ﬁducial WD having a purely toroidal magnetic
ﬁeld conﬁguration ~B = Bφ ˆφ. The maximum magnetic ﬁeld strength inside this

1.476 km, ρ in units of 1010 gm/cm3 and B in units of 1014 G. The yellow curve in each panel
represents the stellar surface.

WD is Bmax = pBφBφ = 3.41 × 1014 G. Interestingly, this is a highly super-
Chandrasekhar WD, having M0 = 3.413M⊙. Note that the value of the surface
magnetic ﬁeld does not aﬀect this result, as long as it is . 1011 G, which is satisﬁed
in this case. In this context, we mention that the detection of very high surface
magnetic ﬁelds & 109 G is very diﬃcult due to the featureless spectrum. 10 Very
importantly, the ratio of the total magnetic energy to the total gravitational bind-
ing energy, Emag/Egrav = 0.3045 (which is much < 1). WDs with even smaller
Emag/Egrav are also found to be highly super-Chandrasekhar (see Figs. 3a and
d). This argues for the WDs to be stable (see, e.g. Ref. 15). The radii ratio,
Rp/Req = 1.074 (which is slightly > 1), indicates a net prolate deformation in the
shape caused due to a toroidal ﬁeld geometry. Figure 1(a) shows that although
the central iso-density contours are compressed into a highly prolate structure, the

outer layers expand, giving rise to an overall quasi-spherical shape. Interestingly,
this justiﬁes the earlier spherically symmetric assumption in computing models of
at least certain strongly magnetized WDs. 1,2,4

Figures 1(b) and (d) show the distribution of baryonic density and magnetic
ﬁeld strength superimposed by magnetic ﬁeld lines respectively, for the ﬁducial WD
having a purely poloidal magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration ~B = Br ˆr+Bθ ˆθ. The maximum
magnetic ﬁeld strength attained at its center is Bmax = pBrBr + BθBθ = 5.34 ×
1014 G, which also leads to a signiﬁcantly super-Chandrasekhar WD having M0 =
1.771M⊙. The WD is highly deformed with an overall oblate shape and Rp/Req =
0.7065, which is expected to be stable because its Emag/Egrav = 0.1138, which is
very much < 1. 15

nent and (b) poloidal component.

Purely toroidal and poloidal ﬁeld conﬁgurations are believed to be subjected
to MHD instabilities, 16 which possibly rearranges the ﬁeld into a mixed conﬁgura-
tion. 17 Hence, for completeness, we also construct equilibrium models of WDs with
a mixed magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration. In Figure 2, we present the results for the
ﬁducial WD having the so-called twisted torus conﬁguration, which compares the
distribution of the toroidal and poloidal components of the magnetic ﬁeld. This
again results in a signiﬁcantly super-Chandrasekhar WD having M0 = 1.754M⊙.
The poloidal component attains Bmax = 4.82 × 1014 G at the center, while the ring-
like toroidal component is an order of magnitude smaller. The WD assumes a highly
oblate shape with Rp/Req = 0.719, resembling the purely poloidal case in all its at-
tributes, and is again expected to be stable having Emag/Egrav = 0.1126 < 1. In a
toroidal dominated mixed ﬁeld conﬁguration, 18 more massive super-Chandrasekhar
WDs could be possible and is worth further exploration. In this context, we mention
that the results in this work have also been reproduced by Bera & Bhattacharya, 19

albeit without any novel contribution to the topic.

We also construct equilibrium sequences of magnetized WDs pertaining to diﬀer-
ent ﬁeld geometries for the ﬁducial case with ρc = 2 × 1010 gm/cm3. Figure 3 shows
the variations of diﬀerent physical quantities as functions of Bmax. The two most
important revelations of Figure 3 are — (1) the WD mass increases with an increase
in magnetic ﬁeld for all the three ﬁeld conﬁgurations discussed above (see Figure
3a), eventually leading to highly super-Chandrasekhar WDs and (2) the magnetic
energy remains (signiﬁcantly) sub-dominant compared to the gravitational binding
energy for all the cases, since Emag/Egrav < 1 always (see Figure 3d), which argues
for the possible existence of stable, highly magnetized super-Chandrasekhar WDs.

4. Conclusions

Since our foray into this topic, we have been persistent with our message that the
versatile nature of magnetic ﬁeld is paramount in the revelation of signiﬁcantly

super-Chandrasekhar WDs, irrespective of its nature of origin: quantum, classical
and/or general relativistic — which is re-emphasized in the present work.

By carrying out extensive, self-consistent, GRMHD numerical analysis of mag-
netized WDs, we have reestablished the existence of highly super-Chandrasekhar,
stable WDs. In order to self-consistently study the anisotropic eﬀect of a strong
magnetic ﬁeld, we have explored various geometrical ﬁeld conﬁgurations, namely,
purely toroidal, purely poloidal and twisted torus conﬁgurations. Interestingly, we
have obtained signiﬁcantly super-Chandrasekhar magnetized WDs for all the cases,
having mass 1.7 − 3.4M⊙, and that too at relatively lower magnetic ﬁeld strengths
when the deviation from spherical symmetry is considered — as already speculated
in our earlier work. 1,6 These WDs can be ideal progenitors of the aforementioned
peculiar, overluminous type Ia supernovae. Our work also establishes the necessity
of a general relativistic formalism over a Newtonian approach while constructing
models of magnetized super-Chandrasekhar WDs.
