ABSTRACT

We present the ﬁrst direct comparison between Balmer line and panchromatic SED-based SFRs for
z ∼ 2 galaxies. For this comparison we used 17 star-forming galaxies selected from the MOSFIRE
Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey, with 3σ detections for Hα and at least two IR bands
(Spitzer/MIPS 24 µm and Herschel/PACS 100 and 160 µm, and in some cases Herschel/SPIRE 250,
350, and 500 µm). The galaxies have total IR (8 − 1000 µm) luminosities of ∼ 1011.4 − 1012.4 L(cid:12)
and star-formation rates (SFRs) of ∼ 30 − 250 M(cid:12) yr−1. We ﬁt the UV-to-far-IR SEDs with ﬂexible
stellar population synthesis (FSPS) models – which include both stellar and dust emission – and
compare the inferred SFRs with the SFR(Hα,Hβ) values corrected for dust attenuation using Balmer
decrements. The two SFRs agree with a scatter of 0.17 dex. Our results imply that the Balmer
decrement accurately predicts the obscuration of the nebular lines and can be used to robustly calculate
SFRs for star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 2 with SFRs up to ∼ 200 M(cid:12) yr−1. We also use our data to assess
SFR indicators based on modeling the UV-to-mid-IR SEDs or by adding SFR(UV) and SFR(IR), for
which the latter is based on the mid-IR only or on the full IR SED. All these SFRs show a poorer
agreement with SFR(Hα,Hβ) and in some cases large systematic biases are observed. Finally, we show
that the SFR and dust attenuation derived from the UV-to-near-IR SED alone are unbiased when
assuming a delayed exponentially declining star-formation history.

INTRODUCTION

Star-formation rates (SFRs) are among the most fun-
damental measurements for constraining the physics of
galaxy formation and evolution. The past decade has
seen a multitude of studies that trace SFRs out to
high redshift (Madau & Dickinson 2014,
and refer-
ences therein), and examined their correlation with other
galaxy properties, such as stellar masses (e.g., Salim
et al. 2007; Reddy et al. 2012b; Shivaei et al. 2015b).
The Spitzer Space Telescope and Herschel Space Obser-
vatory opened a new window into measuring bolometric
SFRs by allowing us to directly correct the widely-used
SFRs(UV) for dust-obscured star formation (e.g., Barro
et al. 2011; Whitaker et al. 2014b; de Barros et al. 2015).
However, despite their common use, the UV+IR SFRs
have several disadvantages: ﬁrst, due to the limited spa-
tial resolution and sensitivity of Spitzer and Herschel,

and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

most of the individual distant galaxies are not detectable
in IR images, and second, the empirical templates used
to convert the mid-IR (restframe 8 µm) ﬂuxes to total
IR luminosities result in systematic biases (Elbaz et al.
2011; Reddy et al. 2012a; Utomo et al. 2014).

Hydrogen Balmer emission lines are considered to be
another gold standard for tracing robust SFRs in local
galaxies (Moustakas et al. 2006; Hao et al. 2011; Kenni-
cutt & Evans 2012, among many others). Until recently,
high-redshift studies (e.g., Muzzin et al. 2010; Ibar et al.
2013; Shivaei et al. 2015a) only detected Hα with no (or
very limited) Hβ measurements, which are required for
accurate dust corrections. However, with the new gener-
ation of multi-object near-IR (NIR) spectrographs, both
Hα and Hβ are now detectable for normal star-forming
galaxies at z ∼ 2 (Kashino et al. 2013; Steidel et al. 2014;
Kriek et al. 2015).

While dust-corrected SFRs(Hα) using Balmer decre-
ments (hereafter, SFRs(Hα,Hβ)) are commonly used at
low redshift, we still need to investigate how well Balmer
lines trace SFR at high redshifts, as galaxies were more
star-forming at z ∼ 2, the peak of the SFR density
evolution (Hopkins & Beacom 2006).
In particular, it
has been argued that Balmer lines may miss optically
thick star-forming regions at these high redshifts (e.g.,
Rodighiero et al. 2014). In order to investigate this possi-
ble bias, one needs to compare the SFRs(Hα,Hβ) with in-
dependently measured UV-to-far-IR (UV-to-FIR) SFRs
for star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 2. Fortunately, such
dusty systems are among the luminous tail of the galaxy
distribution within reach of Herschel.

the MOSDEF survey.

We selected a sample of MOSDEF galaxies based on
their Balmer emission and IR luminosities. The Hα and
Hβ luminosities were estimated by ﬁtting Gaussian func-
tions to the line proﬁles. Flux uncertainties were derived
using Monte Carlo simulations. The spectra were ﬂux
calibrated by comparing the spectrum of a slit star with
the total photometric ﬂux (Skelton et al. 2014) in the
same ﬁlter. To account for the fact that galaxies are
resolved, an additional slit-loss correction was applied
using the HST proﬁles for each galaxy (see Kriek et al.
2015). The uncertainties on the total slit-loss corrected
ﬂuxes were 16% and 20% for Hα and Hβ, respectively
(Reddy et al. 2015). Hα and Hβ ﬂuxes were corrected for
underlying Balmer absorption as determined from UV-
to-NIR SED modeling (Reddy et al. 2015). The Hα lumi-
nosity was converted to SFR using the Kennicutt (1998)
relation and was corrected for dust attenuation using the
Balmer decrement (Hα/Hβ), assuming the Cardelli et al.
(1989) Galactic extinction curve. For those galaxies with
undetected Hβ, we used 3σ upper-limits on the Hβ ﬂuxes
that translate to lower-limits on Hα/Hβ and thus lower-
limits on dust-corrected SFR(Hα,Hβ).

the

For

IR measurements we used data from
Spitzer/MIPS and Herschel/PACS and SPIRE in the
COSMOS (PI: M. Dickinson), GOODS-N, and GOODS-
S ﬁelds (Oliver et al. 2010; Elbaz et al. 2011; Magnelli
et al. 2013). We measured IR ﬂuxes simultaneously us-
ing scaled point-spread functions (PSFs) (Reddy et al.
2010; Shivaei et al. 2015a), which enable us to more ro-
bustly recover ﬂuxes of confused objects.
In brief, for
each image we used a prior list of objects from higher
resolution images to determine the location of all sources
in the ﬁeld. For the MIPS images we used 3σ IRAC
sources; for the PACS images we used 3σ MIPS sources;
and for the SPIRE images we used the PACS sources
detected at 3σ (for the 250 and 350 µm bands) and 5σ
(for the 500 µm band). In order to perform the photome-
try, a subimage centered on each target was constructed
and the PSF was ﬁtted simultaneously to all the objects
in the subimage (including the target) and one random
background position, which was chosen to be at least 1
FWHM away from any source. We repeated this proce-
dure for 20 random background positions. The standard
deviation of the background ﬂuxes was adopted as the
ﬂux uncertainty.

The accuracy of our photometry was tested by sim-
ulating 500 sources with a large range of ﬂuxes that
were added to the original images. The simulated ﬂuxes
were recovered successfully with a given scatter that,
as expected, decreased with increasing ﬂux. Based on
this scatter, we estimated a correction factor to be ap-
plied to the background-estimated errors for each indi-
vidual source. These corrections ranged from a factor of
1.3 − 2.0, depending on the ﬁlter.

We selected galaxies whose IR photometry was not sig-
niﬁcantly aﬀected by nearby sources and had robust de-
tections (signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) > 3σ) in Hα, MIPS
24 µm, and at least one PACS ﬁlter (100 or 160 µm).
The ﬁnal sample consists of 13 galaxies with both Hα
and Hβ detections and 4 Hβ-undetected galaxies. Only
three of these galaxies were detected in the SPIRE ﬁlters.
We did not include objects that were classiﬁed as AGNs
based on their X-ray emission, IRAC colors, or optical

undetected-Hβ galaxies are the purple symbols with a 3σ lower-
limit on their SFRs(Hα,Hβ). For displaying purposes the number
counts of the dark blue histograms are multiplied by 3.

In this paper, we use the unique dataset of the MOS-
FIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey (Kriek
et al. 2015) in combination with Herschel and Spitzer
data, to investigate how well SFRs(Hα,Hβ) agree with
UV-to-FIR SFRs at z ∼ 2. For the latter, we use
the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis (FSPS) mod-
els (Conroy et al. 2009), which utilize energy balance to
ﬁt the stellar and dust emission simultaneously (Berta
et al. 2013; da Cunha et al. 2015). Throughout this pa-
per, we assumed a Chabrier (2003) initial mass function
(IMF), and H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1, ΩΛ = 0.7, Ωm = 0.3.

2. SAMPLE AND MEASUREMENTS

The MOSDEF survey is a multi-year project that uses
the MOSFIRE spectrometer on the Keck I telescope to
study the stellar and gaseous content of ∼ 1500 galax-
ies and AGNs at 1.37 ≤ z ≤ 3.80. The survey covers
the CANDELS ﬁelds, for which extensive deep multi-
wavelength data are available (Grogin et al. 2011; Koeke-
moer et al. 2011; Momcheva et al. 2015). For details of
the survey strategy, observations, data reduction, and
sample characteristics see Kriek et al. (2015). The cur-
rent study is based on data from the ﬁrst two years of

et al. 2015). As seen in Figure 1, most of our galaxies
lie above the median SFR-M∗ relation by Shivaei et al.
(2015b) with M∗ ∼ 1010 − 1011 M(cid:12).

3. PANCHROMATIC SED MODELING

In this section we derive total SFRs by comparing
the panchromatic SEDs - composed of the UV-to-IRAC
photometry from 3D-HST (Skelton et al. 2014; Mom-
cheva et al. 2015) combined with IR photometry (previ-
ous section) - with stellar population models. We gener-
ated composite stellar populations using the FSPS code
(Conroy et al. 2009; Conroy & Gunn 2010, v2.5), as-
suming a Chabrier IMF and solar metallicity. For the
star-formation history (SFH) we assumed a delayed-tau
model of the form SFR(t) ∝ te−t/τ , in which t is the age
of the galaxy and τ is the e-folding time. τ was allowed
to vary from 102 − 104 Myr in steps of 0.2 dex. We set
a 50 Myr lower limit on age corresponding to the typi-
cal dynamical timescale at z ∼ 2 (Reddy et al. 2015).
We adopted a Calzetti et al. (2000) attenuation curve,

in which the dust optical depth at 5500 ˚A was allowed
to vary from 0.0 to 4.0 in steps of 0.1. The dust emis-
sion in the FSPS code follows the Draine & Li (2007)
(DL07) models. In these dust models, the radiation ﬁeld
strength, P (U )dU , is described by a delta function at
Umin (the radiation intensity to which the dust in the
diﬀuse ISM is exposed) and a power-law component for
the radiation from dust heated by more intense starlight
(OB associations). The parameter γ represents the frac-
tion of dust that is heated by the intense starlight. As
was suggested in DL07, we allowed Umin to vary between
0.1 to 25.0 in 10 logarithmic steps, the γ grid was set
to [0.0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.10, 0.15], and we explored
PAH fractions of 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10%.

We shifted the models to the spectroscopic redshift of
each galaxy, applied the Madau (1995) prescription to
correct the SEDs for the intergalactic medium absorp-
tion, and then, adopting a χ2 minimization method (us-
ing the original photometric errors), ﬁt the models to
the UV-to-FIR photometry. The optical photometry was
corrected for contamination by bright emission lines (Hα,

tra (Reddy et al. 2015). We perturbed the photometry
according to the measurement uncertainties for 100 re-
alizations and the dispersion in each best-ﬁt parameter
was adopted as the associated uncertainty.

The best-ﬁt models of the Hα+Hβ-detected candidates
are displayed in Figures 2 and 3. We would have found
similar SFRs if instead we modeled the IR emission by a
single blackbody SED. In order to assure that our best-ﬁt
models are not skewed by the smaller 24 µm errors com-
pared to the PACS errors, we tested the SED ﬁtting with
equal weighting for the 24, 100, and 160 µm ﬂuxes. For
all but two galaxies (galaxies 1 and 13), the correspond-
ing SFRs and IR luminosities were within 1σ uncertainty
of the original SFR and L(IR) values.

4. SFR COMPARISON

In this section we investigate how the SFRs derived
from diﬀerent diagnostics compare with each other. Fit-
ting the stellar and dust SEDs simultaneously using en-
ergy balance is thought to give a robust estimate of
the total SFR. Figure 4(a) shows that SFRs(Hα,Hβ)
are in good agreement with the full SED-inferred SFRs
(SFRfull SED). The tightness of the correlation between

log(SFR(Hα,Hβ)) and log(SFRfull SED)9, its consistency
with the unity line, and the absence of any systematic
correlation as a function of M∗ (see the inset plot 4(a)),
imply that the dust-corrected L(Hα,Hβ) is an unbiased
tracer of the total SFR for z ∼ 2 star-forming galaxies
with SFRs up to ∼ 200 M(cid:12) yr−1.
There is a systematic uncertainty associated with our
choice of the attenuation curve. Assuming the Calzetti
curve instead of the Cardelli curve to correct the ob-
served Hα predicts higher SFRs by an average factor of
1.2 (as high as 1.4 for the galaxy with the highest SFR;
diamonds in Figure 4 a). The larger dust correction is
expected as the Calzetti curve has a higher normaliza-
tion at 6563 ˚A. We adopted the Cardelli curve as it was
derived based on the line-of-sight measurements of HII
regions, and therefore preferable for the extinction cor-
rection of nebular lines.
Given that the majority of the z ∼ 2 galaxies are not
detected with Herschel, it is important to know how well
we can recover the total SFR with only 24 µm data. We

ﬁt the FSPS models to the UV-to-24 µm data and set
the dust emission parameters to the default values (PAH
fraction = 3.5%, γ = 0.01, and Umin = 1.0). The result is
shown in Figure 4(b). There is a larger (0.22 dex) scatter
between SFRUV−24 and SFR(Hα,Hβ), and SFRUV−24
underestimates SFR(Hα,Hβ) for the highest star-forming
galaxies in our sample.

In Figure 4, panels c and d, we estimated the bolo-
metric SFR by adding unobscured SFR(UV) to ob-
scured SFR(IR). The SFR(UV) is derived from lumi-
nosity at 1600 ˚A by ﬁtting a power-law function of the
form fλ ∝ λβ to the photometry at rest wavelengths
1268−2580 ˚A, and using the Kennicutt (1998) conversion

between L(UV) and SFR. In order to estimate the total
L(IR), we ﬁt the locally calibrated Chary & Elbaz (2001)
templates (hereafter, CE01) to the 24, 100, and 160 µm
ﬂuxes in Figure 4(c), and in Figure 4(d) we converted the
24 µm to total L(IR) using the luminosity-independent
conversions of Wuyts et al. (2008) (hereafter, W08).

The scatter between both the SFR(IR) indicators and
SFR(Hα,Hβ) is larger than the scatter in Figure 4(a) by
∼ 0.1 dex. Incorporating the SPIRE photometry in the
CE01 ﬁtting does not change the results, as most of our
galaxies are undetected in the SPIRE bands. Whether
the increased scatter is due to the limited parameter
space of the IR templates or because of ignoring energy

balance is an open question that cannot be addressed
with the limited data used in this study.

Moreover, we tested the Kennicutt et al. (2009)
empirically-derived coeﬃcients to infer total SFRs by
combining observed Hα and IR luminosities.
The
combined SFRs were systematically lower than our
SFR(Hα,Hβ) and SFRfull−SED by ∼ 0.1 dex. The Kenni-
cutt et al. (2009) sample of nearby galaxies have a higher
contribution of evolved populations of stars heating the
dust, and therefore, their scaling factor underestimates
the total SFR for our star-forming galaxies.

Our sample contains 4 galaxies without Hβ detec-
tions, for which we determined 3σ lower limits on the
SFR(Hα,Hβ). The low SFRfull SED of the Hβ-undetected
galaxies compared to the rest of the sample indicates that
we are not biased against galaxies in which Hβ is sup-
pressed by dust attenuation. The Hβ line in all four
galaxies happened to fall close to a bright skyline, which
likely explains their low S/N in Hβ.

5. ARE THE IR AND UV EMISSION COUPLED?

One concern regarding the use of energy-balance SED
modeling is that for a galaxy with two distinct stellar
populations, with one enshrouded by dust, and hence,
bright in IR, and the other population less dusty and
brighter in UV, the IR and UV-to-NIR parts of the
spectrum will be decoupled. For such cases, an energy-
balance method would underestimate the true SFR and
L(IR). To address this issue, we calculated L(IR) based
on the the UV-to-NIR SED and compared it to the ob-
served 0.3 − 8µm photometry (using the same stellar
population models and ﬁtting assumptions as for the
full modeling, Section 3). We used the estimated to-
tal extinction value at 1600 ˚A (A1600) and unobscured
SFR(UV) measured from the luminosity at 1600 ˚A, to
calculate the obscured SFR:

SFRobscured = SFR(UV) (100.4A1600 − 1.0).

(1)

Using the Kennicutt (1998) relation, we converted the
obscured SFR to total L(IR) at 8 − 1000 µm and com-
pared it to the L(IR) based on our best-ﬁt full SED
model, integrated from 8 to 1000 µm. The results are
shown in Figure 5. For all galaxies in our sample, the
UV-to-NIR SED-derived L(IR) is within a factor of ∼ 2
of the integrated full SED L(IR), suggesting that there
is not a dominant stellar population that is completely
obscured and thus missed from the UV-to-NIR SED.

The results of the UV-to-NIR SED-inferred IR lumi-
nosities are sensitive to the assumed SFH and the SED-
predicted ages. If instead of a delayed-tau SFH we use a
rising SFH of the form SFR(t) ∝ et/τ , the best-ﬁt SED
model predicts a high amount of dust obscuration for our
most massive galaxies. Because of the high dust obscu-
ration inferred from the stellar SED, L(IR) and SFR are
overpredicted by a factor of (cid:38) 2. Additionally, as found
in previous studies (e.g., Wuyts et al. 2011a), without
a minimum age of 50 Myr the best-ﬁt UV-to-NIR SEDs
result in unrealistically young ages and high dust values
for a subset of our galaxies.

The L(IR) comparison test is similar to comparing the
UV-to-NIR and full SED SFRs. With a physically rea-
sonable age range and the delayed-tau SFHs, the UV-
to-NIR SED and full SED SFRs are in good agreement
(ρs = 0.90, 3.0σ away from a zero correlation). Both tests
illustrate that the SFR derived from the stellar emission
alone is not biased compared to the UV-to-FIR SED-
based SFR for z ∼ 2 galaxies with M∗ ∼ 1010 − 1011 M(cid:12)
and SFR ∼ 30 − 210 M(cid:12) yr−1.

6. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS

UV-inferred SFRs are susceptible to missing or under-
estimating the SFR of galaxies for which the bulk of the
star formation is obscured and the UV slope is decou-
pled from the total obscuration (Reddy et al. 2010; Casey
et al. 2014). Although for a given column of dust Hα and
Hβ are less attenuated than the UV, HII regions may also
be optically thick at these wavelengths. We show in this
paper that for galaxies with SFRs ∼ 30 − 250 M(cid:12) yr−1
the Hα luminosity, once properly corrected for dust at-
tenuation using the Balmer decrement, do not underes-
timate the SFR. The same result holds for UV-to-NIR
SED inferred SFRs, assuming delayed-tau SFHs. This
conclusion does not necessarily hold at higher SFRs (i.e.,
submillimeter galaxies) owing to highly obscured nebu-
lar and/or stellar regions. Such IR-luminous galaxies are
likely missed in our study due to their low number den-
sity or highly obscured emission lines. To test the lat-
ter, we checked the MOSDEF target sample for galaxies
with IR detections and undetected Hα lines, and found
two. Due to uncertain redshifts and noisy spectra we did
not include them in this study. However, deeper and/or
wider wavelength range spectra are needed to conﬁrm
these systems.

There are additional caveats to our analysis which need
to be explored in more detail in future studies. First,
both the SFR(Hα,Hβ) and the SFRfull SED suﬀer from
systematic uncertainties in the assumed IMF, metallic-
ity, and SFH. Second, the SFR(Hα,Hβ) is aﬀected by
the choice of the assumed dust attenuation curve (Sec-
tion 4), and the SFRfull SED by the assumed dust emission
models. Once we have the complete MOSDEF dataset
in hand, we will build upon the results of this study by
