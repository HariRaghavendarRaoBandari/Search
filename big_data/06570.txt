ABSTRACT
Giant radio relics are the arc-shaped diffuse radio emission regions observed in the outskirts
of some merging galaxy clusters. They are believed to trace shock-waves in the intra-cluster
medium. Recent observations demonstrated that some prominent radio relics exhibit a steep-
ening above 2 GHz in their radio spectrum. This challenges standard theoretical models be-
cause shock acceleration is expected to accelerate electrons to very high energies with a
power-law distribution in momentum. In this work we attempt to reconcile these data with
the shock-acceleration scenario. We propose that the spectral steepening may be caused by
the highest energy electrons emitting preferentially in lower magnetic ﬁelds than the bulk of
synchrotron bright electrons in relics. Here, we focus on a model with an increasing mag-
netic ﬁeld behind the shock front, which quickly saturates and then declines. We derive the
time-evolution of cosmic-ray electron spectra in time variable magnetic ﬁelds and an ex-
panding medium. We then apply the formalism on the large radio relic in the cluster CIZA
J2242.8+5301 (the Sausage relic). We show that under favourable circumstances of mag-
netic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation downstream, our model can explain the observed radio spectrum, the
brightness proﬁle and the spectral index proﬁle of the relic. A possible interpretation for the
required ampliﬁcation of the magnetic ﬁeld downstream is a dynamo acting behind the shock
with an injection scale of magnetic turbulence of about 10 kpc. Our models require injec-
tion efﬁciencies of CRe - which are in tension with simple diffusive shock acceleration from
the thermal pool. We show that this problem can likely be alleviated considering pre-existing
CRe.

INTRODUCTION

Galaxy clusters are the largest bound structures in the cosmological
matter distribution, with masses of a up to few 1015 Msol (Kravtsov
& Borgani 2012). In their massive Dark Matter dominated grav-
itational potential, baryons accumulate to form the intra-cluster-
medium (ICM). The ICM is a hot, thin plasma and makes clusters
bright X-ray sources (Meekins et al. 1971; Sarazin 1988). Obser-
vations of these sources reveal a medium behaving collisional on
small scales, with complex features such as steep density gradi-
ents, cold fronts and shocks (Markevitch & Vikhlinin 2007). The
features are probably caused by cluster mergers, which dissipate
potential energy in the ICM and drive shocks and turbulence in the
otherwise nearly isothermal cluster atmosphere.

The intra-cluster-medium also hosts non-thermal components:
cosmic-ray electrons (CRe) and magnetic ﬁelds at the µG level.
In some clusters, this is prominently evidenced by diffuse steep
spectrum radio synchrotron sources (Feretti et al. 2012; Brunetti &
Jones 2014). These radio sources are commonly classiﬁed as gi-
ant radio halos and giant radio relics: radio halos are characterised
as diffuse unpolarised Mpc-sized emission centered on the X-ray
emission from the ICM. In contrast, radio relics are strongly po-
larised elongated radio sources at the outskirts of clusters. Their
formation mechanism is believed to be very different: radio ha-
los are probably associated with merger-driven turbulence and the
subsequent re-acceleration of a cluster-wide radio dark cosmic-ray
electron population (Brunetti & Jones 2014). On the other hand, ra-
dio relics are probably connected to merger-driven low Mach num-
ber shocks and the subsequent acceleration of CRe by the shock
(Br¨uggen et al. 2012; Brunetti & Jones 2014).

Giant radio relics have been a subject of intense study. There

2

are about 40 radio relics known to date, all connected to merging
clusters (Feretti et al. 2012). Some of them occur in pairs as dou-
ble relics (Bonafede et al. 2012; de Gasperin et al. 2015), some are
connected to radio haloes (Shimwell et al. 2015; van Weeren et al.
2012; Markevitch et al. 2005; van Weeren et al. 2016), many are
connected to radio galaxies and show an irregular, complex mor-
phology (e.g. van Weeren et al. 2013).

Theoretical models for radio relics assume particle accelera-
tion at the shock to inject cosmic-ray electrons (CRe) into the ICM,
which subsequently lose energy through inverse Compton and syn-
chrotron losses and emit synchrotron radiation (Ensslin et al. 1998).
A similar model, based on diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) from
the thermal pool, successfully explains the non-thermal emission in
supernova remnant (SNR) shocks, however at much higher Mach
numbers of about 100 (Fermi 1949; Blandford & Eichler 1987).
Observations of SNR show that high-Mach number shocks in these
environment accelerates many more protons than electrons (Mor-
lino & Caprioli 2012; Caprioli et al. 2015). The energy density of
accelerated CRp commonly exceeds the CRe energy density by a
factor of ten to 100.

In clusters however, this picture is challenged by the large ef-
ﬁciencies required to reproduce the total radio synchrotron bright-
ness of many relics (see Brunetti & Jones 2014, for a review). In
cluster relics this scenario would predict that CRp induced γ-ray
emission exceeds the tight upper limits set by the FERMI satellite
(Vazza & Br¨uggen 2014; Ackermann et al. 2014).

To alleviate the large requirements for acceleration efﬁcien-
cies of CRe, recent models for cluster relics assume shock re-
acceleration of a pre-existing population of CRe (Kang et al. 2012;
Kang & Ryu 2013; Vazza et al. 2015; Pinzke et al. 2013; Kang
et al. 2014; Markevitch et al. 2005). However, the absence of
CRp-induced γ-ray emission in clusters remains puzzling (Brunetti
& Jones 2014). CRp are expected to be subject to shock re-
acceleration as well and hence should be γ-ray bright. Relic models
commonly employ comparatively large magnetic ﬁelds in the emis-
sion region, usually from 1 − 7 µG. Lower limits to the magnetic
ﬁeld strength were found from IC limits of up to 4 µG in some
clusters (Finoguenov et al. 2010). Observations now also suggest
a ﬁlamentary structure of the post-shock ﬁeld on scales above 100
kpc (van Weeren et al. 2016; Owen et al. 2014). Furthermore, the
polarization of many relics has lead to the view that the required
magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation originates from shock compression.
However, magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation has not been studied in great
detail (see however Iapichino & Br¨uggen 2012), and downstream
magnetic ﬁeld decay has never been discussed in the literature.

The prototype of radio relics is probably the northern relic
in CIZA J2242.8+5301 (van Weeren et al. 2010). Its large exten-
sion of 2 Mpc, very narrow brightness proﬁle with an FWHM of
55 kpc at 610 MHz and homogeneous brightness distribution have
coined the term ”Sausage relic”. The data provide direct evidence
for a large shock and subsequent CRe cooling at the outskirts of the
cluster. Its simplicity has made the cluster a preferred target for the
study of shock acceleration in the ICM. The cluster hosts another
morphologically irregular counter relic in the south that is possibly
connected to a few radio galaxies (Stroe et al. 2013).

Recently, Stroe et al. (2014, 2016) discovered spectral steep-
ening beyond 2 GHz in the radio spectrum of the northern relic
and the ”Toothbrush” relic, the same was also found in A2256
by Trasatti et al. (2015). This new constraint appears to funda-
mentally contradict the standard picture for the formation of ra-
dio relics, which predicts a power-law up to very high frequencies
(Ensslin et al. 1998; Kang & Ryu 2015). In case of the northern

relic in CIZA J2242.8+5301, the observed emission at 30 GHz
is more than a factor 15 below the simple power-law model used
to ﬁt the low frequencies (van Weeren et al. 2010). Kang & Ryu
(2015) conclude that the steepening is unlikely caused by the re-
acceleration of a pre-existing CRe population. Basu et al. (2015)
suggest that the steepening can be attributed to the SZ decrement,
however only for steep radio spectra corresponding to Mach num-
bers below three. Kang & Ryu (2016) considered a scenario where
a shock has crossed a cloud of ﬁnite extend and the relic emission
originates from aged CR electrons. They conclude that this could
lead to the observed steepening in the spectrum. In any case, our
understanding of radio relics has been shaken by the Sausage relic
alone: Neither exists a satisfactory model for its radio spectrum,
nor do we understand the mechanism leading to the high magnetic
ﬁeld value required in current models.

In this article, we attempt to solve this discrepancy by explor-
ing the possibility that the steepening in the spectrum of relics is
indicative of higher energy CRe emitting in a lower magnetic ﬁeld,
hence signiﬁcantly reducing the total emission at high frequencies.
This could be caused by a number of physical situations, among
them slow magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation directly behind the shock
or diffusion of preferentially high energy CRe into regions with
low magnetic ﬁeld.

We focus this work on effects from time-dependent magnetic
ﬁelds and adiabatic expansion of the thermal gas behind the shock.
We neglect other effects like CR diffusion, reconnection and the
possibly pre-existing CRe distribution (Kang & Ryu 2015), for
simplicity. We show that under favourable conditions for the evo-
lution of the magnetic ﬁeld downstream, it is possible to model
the spectral properties and brightness distribution observed in this
relic. Magnetic ﬁelds and their ampliﬁcation in or behind collision-
less shocks in the outskirts of clusters are not well understood or
constrained, in fact the problem has been largely ignored in the
literature (see however Iapichino & Br¨uggen 2012). Hence an em-
pirical model can yield constrains on the magnetic ﬁeld evolution
at shocks at the cluster outskirts. As motivated above, the simple
structure of the northern radio relic in CIZA J2242.8+5301, its po-
tentially high Mach number and the excellent available radio data
make it the ideal target for this investigation.

This work will require to calculate the synchrotron brightness
of CRe cooling in a time-variable magnetic ﬁeld and adiabatic ex-
pansion. We develop this formalism in the next section. In section
3, we review the recent state-of-the-art observations of the cluster
to set reasonable parameters for the shock. We also describe four
magnetic ﬁeld models in the downstream region, which we chose
empirically to ﬁt the data (we explore the parameter space of these
models in appendix C). We compare the model with observations
in section 4. The discussion and interpretation of the results is put
forward in section 5. Our summary is reported in section 7.
Throughout the paper, we assume a standard ΛCDM con-
cordance cosmology, with H0 = 70 km s−1Mpc−1, ΩM = 0.3
and ΩΛ = 0.7. Hence, at the redshift of the cluster, 1 arcmin =
192 kpc, this means a luminosity distance of dlum ≈ 930 Mpc.

2 SCENARIO & FORMALISM

Here we explore an extension of the standard theoretical scenario
for radio relics evaluating the changes in the observed radio spec-
trum induced by the evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld in the down-
stream region. The goal is to scrutinize whether these effects can
explain the steepening observed at high frequencies in the inte-

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–17

grated spectrum of some radio relics.
We assume the following steps :

(i) Cosmic-ray electrons are accelerated or re-accelerated at the
shock via DSA with a power-law spectrum. We assume the usual
dependency of acceleration efﬁciency with Mach number (Bland-
ford & Eichler 1987).

(ii) Cosmic-ray electrons evolve and cool downstream, also due

to adiabatic expansion.

(iii) The magnetic ﬁeld is gradually ampliﬁed downstream and
then declines with increasing distance from the shock. Ampliﬁca-
tion by compression in the shock is relevant only so far, as it sets
the initial ﬁeld in our model: Bmin.

2.1 Adiabatic Expansion behind an ICM Shock

Behind a shock in the ICM, the thermal plasma with number
density nth is going to settle into the gravitational potential of
the cluster atmosphere, subsequently expanding. As a simple ﬁrst
model for this process, we assume that this expansion is only one-
dimensional along the shock normal with velocity vexp away from
the shock on a time scale of texp, which in turn increases the down-
stream velocity (vdw) as a function of time and distance from the
shock (r(t)):

where the downstream velocity at t = 0 is vdw(0) = cs,upM/σ,
with the upstream sound speed cs,up, Mach number M and the
compression factor σ (see table 1). The expansion formally lasts
until t = texpln (vup/vdw,0), i.e. vdw = vup. However, as the
ICM density is stratiﬁed, expansion will likely seize long before
this time. As usual, for a frozen in magnetic ﬁeld: B(t) ∝ n2/3
during the expansion.

2.2 Cosmic-ray Electron Evolution

In the downstream region, a population of CR electrons can be
described by its isotropic spectrum in number density n(p, t) dp
over momentum p = E/c (in the ultra-relativistic limit). The time-
evolution of this spectrum is given by the diffusion-loss equation
(see e.g. Longair 2011, for a pedagogic introduction):

where we neglect spatial diffusion and non-linear momentum dif-

CRe are subject to a number of energy losses. In radio relics,
radiative losses through inverse Compton scattering with CMB
photons and synchrotron emission due to the ambient magnetic
ﬁeld B(t) are dominant at synchrotron bright momenta (see also
ﬁgure 1). These are given by (e.g. Kardashev 1962):

where we have assumed that the CRe number density evolves like

sume that the shock instantaneously injects a power-law spectrum
of CR electrons only at time t = 0, i.e. the injection function in eq.

Q(p, t) = n0p

where n0 is the normalisation of the CRe spectrum1 and s is the
spectral index. According to standard DSA the spectral index is
related to the Mach number M of the shock by (e.g. Drury 1983;
Blandford & Eichler 1987):

s = 2

2.2.1

Solution

Following Pacholczyk (1973), chapter 6.3, we obtain the time-
evolution of n(p, t) in absence of additional injection, escape or
any other effect except cooling and expansion from the sum of
equations 6 and 7. This leads to:

p(t) =

Here β(t) is the time-integrated magnetic energy density, which
parametrizes the cumulative effect of cooling and expansion on the
spectrum. The time evolution of the CR electron spectrum can then
be found from n(p, t) dp|t=0 = n(p0, 0) dp0 and the injection
function eq. 9 as initial condition:

n(p, t) = n0psesXt(cid:104)

where the last factor accounts for the change in volume of the
gas until expansion stops, formally at vdw = vshock. The impor-
tant quantity governing the cooling of the CRe population is β(t),
which for a constant magnetic ﬁeld B(t) = Bconst and no expan-
sion (texp → ∞) becomes:

βJP(t) =(cid:0)B2

CMB(1 + z)4(cid:1) t,

(15)

so equation 14 becomes the standard Jaffe-Perola model (Jaffe &

The additional effect of adiabatic expansion is then to shift this
spectrum to lower momenta and reduce its normalisation (see ﬁgure

2.3 Synchrotron Emission
The synchrotron emissivity jν in erg cm−3sec−1Hz−1 of an
isotropic CR electron population n(p, t) dp in a homogeneous

eq. 22 at four frequencies: 30 GHz (triangles), 2.1 GHz (crosses), 610 MHz
(diamonds), 150 MHz (asterisk). We relate the lifetime to the distance of the
shock in CIZA J2242.8+5301 with a downstream velocity of 1000 km/s.

where K(x) is the synchrotron kernel, K5/3 is the Bessel function.
The total synchrotron luminosity L(ν) in erg/sec/Hz can then be
found by integrating eq. 17 over the volume of the relic. Under the
assumption of slowly varying ICM properties and a downstream
speed vdw(t) to convert distance from the shock to time:

For the second equation we again used the parameters from section
3. The integrations in t, θ and p have to be done numerically, we
use a midpoint rule for the former two and a Simpson rule for the
latter2.

2.4 Lifetimes and Basic Relic Physics

The lifetime of CRe is deﬁned as tlife = p/ ˙p, where p is the
momentum of a CRe and ˙p designates the systematic momentum
losses of the CRe due to radiative and Coulomb losses (equation 6
and Donnert & Brunetti (2014)).

In ﬁgure 1, we show this lifetime of CRe over momentum
at cluster outskirts assuming magnetic ﬁelds of 5 and 0.5 µG, as
full black line and dashed black line, respectively. We also show
the lifetime in cluster centres as dot-dashed black line. We mark
the smallest synchrotron bright momenta at 30 GHz (triangles),
2.1 GHz (crosses), 610 MHz (diamonds) and 150 MHz (asterisks).
These momenta can be deﬁned as:

(cid:114) ν

pSample =

CCritB(t)

(22)

where one assumes x = 1, sin θ = 1. The lifetime can be con-
verted into a distance from the injection of CRe, using the down-
wind shock speed (here we neglect expansion of the gas). This dis-
tance is shown on the right ordinate.

We see that at high observed radio frequencies, lifetimes of
the emitting CRe are as short as a few ten Myrs (triangles), which

2 efﬁcient IDL routines are available from the authors upon request.

translates to a few ten kpc distance from the shock. That means, the
emitting region becomes very thin at high frequencies (> 10 GHz).
Lifetimes increase substantially at radio frequencies below 5
GHz (crosses, diamonds, asterisks), resulting in a relic thickness of
several 100 kpc. Because of high IC cooling (BIC = BCMB(1 +
z)2 = 4.6 µG at the cluster redshift), lifetimes are not strongly
dependent on the ambient magnetic ﬁeld. Under these conditions,
an increase in the magnetic ﬁeld by a factor of ten even leads to
an increase of lifetime of the observed CRe, because the sampling
momentum increases as well (eq. 22). It is in general not trivial to
assess the effect of the changing ﬁeld on the total spectrum of a
relic from the lifetime alone. However, lifetimes of CRe at a given
frequency is the maximized, if B = BIC/
Lifetimes peak with 1 Gyr at 300 mec for the cluster cen-
tre (thermal number density nth = 10−3 cm3) and 7 Gyr at 100
mec at the location of the relic (nth = 10−4 cm3). Cooling is here
dominated by Coulomb losses, hence dependent mostly on thermal
density, not magnetic ﬁeld strength (see Donnert & Brunetti 2014,
for details). This means CRe can accumulate at cluster outskirts
from z = 1 onwards, with radio galaxies as a certain source of the
CR injection (see also section 6).

3 A MODEL FOR THE SHOCK IN CIZA J2242.8+5301

In the discovery paper, van Weeren et al. (2010) modelled the relic
with a Mach number of 4.6, a shock speed of 1000 km/s and a mag-
netic ﬁeld of 5µ G, using the standard formalism (e.g. Ensslin et al.
1998; Hoeft & Br¨uggen 2007). van Weeren et al. (2011) showed a
simple numerical model for the shock and constrained the merger
scenario to two colliding clusters with a mass ratio of one to two.
The shock related to the northern relic was discovered in the X-
rays by Akamatsu & Kawahara (2013); Akamatsu et al. (2015),
who ﬁnd a Mach number of 2.7 for the shock. Ogrean et al. (2013)
observed the cluster with XMM-Newton constraining the thermal
ICM properties also in front of the shock wave. Stroe et al. (2015);
Sobral et al. (2015) studied the interaction of the shock with the
star-forming galaxies in CIZA J2242.8+5301. Ogrean et al. (2014)
investigate the internal structure of the ICM and ﬁnd several den-
sity discontinuities and shock candidates in the center of the cluster.

Table 1. Observed and derived parameters of the shock in CIZA J2242.8+5301 as assumed in this work.

Stroe et al. (2014) conducted spatially resolved age modelling on
the relic, ﬁnding a Mach number of 2.9 and an downstream speed
of 905 km/s from aging arguments. Jee et al. (2015) constrained
the Dark Matter distribution in the merger, resulting in a total mass
of 2 × 1015 Msol. CIZA J2242.8+5301 is thereby one of the most
massive clusters known to date.

The redshift of the cluster CIZA J2242.8+5301 has been found
to be z ≈ 0.19 (Jee et al. 2015). Observations show no signiﬁcant
difference in redshift between the two sub-clusters, hence we as-
sume the cluster merger is roughly in the plane of the sky (Dawson
et al. 2015), see also Kang et al. (2012).

We assume the volume associated with the northern giant ra-
dio relic has the form of a cuboid with a length of 2000 kpc, a
cross-section area of 260 kpc × 260 kpc and a distance from the
centre of the cluster of 1500 kpc (van Weeren et al. 2010). We as-
sume a shock with a homogeneous Mach number M of 4.6, this
results in a compression ratio of σ = 3.5. We neglect projection
effects, van Weeren et al. (2010) showed that the relic extends less
than 10 degrees into the plane of the sky (see also Kang et al. 2012).
We discuss this in section 5.

We note that the Mach number assumed here is inconsistent
with Mach numbers inferred from X-ray observations. However,
we anticipate that shocks with Mach numbers M (cid:54) 4 will not
reproduce the observed spectral index proﬁle of the relic, which re-
quire a downstream velocity of vdw (cid:62) 1200 km/s (see Stroe et al.
(2014) and section 4.4). A discussion of our models with a Mach
number of 3 can be found in appendix B. This problem of incon-
sistency between the Mach numbers measured in the X-rays and
those derived from radio observations of relics (assuming DSA) is
well known (Akamatsu et al. 2015; Brunetti & Jones 2014). Hong
et al. (2014) discussed this problem using numerical simulations.
They ﬁnd that complex shocks contain a range of Mach numbers
and radio observations are likely biased towards the highest Mach
numbers in the distribution.

We set the upwind temperature to 3.0 keV, consistent with
measurements from X-ray observatories, which found Tup =
2.7+1.2−0.7 keV (Akamatsu & Kawahara 2013; Ogrean et al. 2014;
Akamatsu et al. 2015). This leads to a downwind shock speed of
1184 km/s using the standard Mach number of 4.6. For this calcu-

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–17

lation we took a pre-shock density of nth,up = 1.6 × 10−4 cm−3,
which is based on Suzaku data (Akamatsu priv. comm.).

3.1 Magnetic Field Models

Radio relics are commonly modelled with spatially constant down-
stream magnetic ﬁelds, in the case of CIZA J2242.8+5301, van
Weeren et al. (2010) model the relic with B = 5 µG, which was
subsequently used in other work (Stroe et al. 2014). We adopt this
value in a model we name our ”standard model”, which we will
show as a black line in all ﬁgures. As mentioned before, a break
in the total synchrotron spectrum motivates that shorter lived CRe
radiate in a smaller magnetic ﬁeld. This can be realised by increas-
ing in the magnetic ﬁeld just behind the shock and the subsequent
injection of the CR electrons. This leads to a natural decoupling of
the region of CRe injection/acceleration (at the shock) and the mag-
netic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation, which is gradually ampliﬁed in the down-
stream region. We heuristically chose three functional forms for
this increase, linear increase of magnetic energy (green in all ﬁg-
ures, henceforth ”linear model”), exponential increase of the ﬁeld
(red in all ﬁgures, henceforth ”exponential model”) and step func-
tion (blue in all ﬁgures, henceforth ”step model”). The former two
can be physically motivated, which we discuss in section 5, the
step-function increase is physically not motivated, we chose it as
an extreme case for comparison. In the linear and exponential case,
we assume that the magnetic ﬁeld reaches a maximum value at dis-
tance deq, and then declines at larger distances. In the exponential
model, the decline is assumed to result from the adiabatic expan-
sion (section 2.1) under the hypothesis of ﬂux-freezing of the mag-
netic ﬁeld into the thermal plasma, i.e. B ∝ n2/3
th . We use an expo-
nential decay of the density with an e-folding time of 240 Myrs in
the exponential model (red). For the linear model (green), we use
an exponent δ = −0.3, but do not follow the adiabatic expansion of
the gas, i.e. leave velocity and density constant. Then the magnetic
ﬁeld models take the form:

• Standard model (black):

B = 5 µG

Weeren et al. 2010; Stroe et al. 2014; Kang & Ryu 2015). A best
ﬁt model is found for saturation scales deq of 20, 35 and 50 kpc for
step, exponential and linear model, respectively. An exploration of
the parameter space of magnetic ﬁeld values is given in appendix
C, where we conclude that at high frequencies the radio spectrum
is most sensitive to the minimum magnetic ﬁeld and the saturation
scale.

We show all four magnetic ﬁeld models over time and distance
in ﬁgure 2, where we also plot β(t)/109 as dotted lines. In our
new models, the cooling is IC dominated, so the cooling term β
is basically the same for the new models. Small differences arise
only for d (cid:29) deq. This is different from the standard model, where
the magnetic ﬁeld about the same as the IC equivalent ﬁeld BCMB.
Here both mechanism contribute to the cooling, and Stroe et al.
(2014) showed that the resulting CRe cooling speed is close to its
minimum with these values.

In our new models, the structure of the relic then motivates a
different location of the shock, so the brightness peak of model and
observed data coincide. In the standard model, the shock and the
peak of the brightness proﬁle coincide, i.e. deq = 0. In contrast,
in the new models we assume that the shock is located deq > 0
in front of the brightness peak. The situation is further complicated
by the ﬁnite resolution of the observed brightness proﬁles and pro-
jection effects, which broaden the rising ﬂank of the emission and
shift its peak, as shown in van Weeren et al. (2010). In the stan-
dard model, the emission is consistent with 610 MHz data and the

with deq =
vdw(t). For the standard model, β(t) is then given
by eq. 15, for the other models it follows straight forward from eq.
13, in case of the step and linear model with X = 0.

An overview of the parameters used in this work is given
in table 2. To ﬁt the data, we empirically ﬁnd a minimum mag-
netic ﬁeld value roughly consistent with naive estimates at the
outskirts of clusters Bmin = 0.3 µG, and a maximum value of
Bmax = 3.0 µG, roughly consistent with previous work (van

deq so the model ﬁts the brightness peak, without considering pro-
jection effects. Simulations are required to further study the shock
geometry, projection effects and constrain this aspect of the model.
To ease computation, we assume instantaneous injection of the

CR electrons in all models.

4 RESULTS
4.1 Time-dependent CRe and Synchrotron Spectra

We begin by demonstrating the action of cooling and synchrotron
sampling in the formalism. In ﬁgure 3 left, we show the time evolu-
tion of n(p, t) from equation 14, for three magnetic ﬁeld models at
7 times (0, 2.41, 5.84, 14.1, 34.1, 82.7, 200 Myr) in cgs units. We
do not show the step model, because it is not very instructive. We
over-plot the age of the spectrum above the break momentum of the
standard JP model with 5 µG (black). The other two models (stan-
dard color scheme) show a delayed break in the spectrum, because
the magnetic ﬁeld contributes less to the cooling in the beginning,
i.e. the cooling is completely IC dominated. The exponential model
shows a shift in amplitude at late times, due to the expansion of the
thermal plasma. This uniformity in cooling is a result of the high
IC equivalent magnetic ﬁeld of BIC = 4.6 µG.

In ﬁgure 3, right, we compare synchrotron spectra at 8, 26
and 83 Myr for the standard (black) and exponential model (red)
from equation 17. We add the emission from the injection, which
is calculated fully analytically from the standard formulae in pur-
ple for both models. In contrast to the CRe spectra, the associated
synchrotron spectrum of the exponential model increases in bright-
ness by nearly a factor of ten. This is despite the expansion and
due to the increasing magnetic ﬁeld, which also leads to changes in
sampling momenta (compare eq. 22).

4.2 Integrated Synchrotron Spectra

We solve equation 21 for the standard values given in table 1 for
all four models. We chose a normalisation n0 of the CRe spec-
trum equation 5, so the total ﬂux from the model roughly ﬁts the
observed spectrum around 1 GHz. The normalisation values are re-
ported for all four models in table 3

The resulting integrated radio synchrotron spectra over fre-
quency are shown in ﬁgure 4. We mark the standard model as solid
black line, the new model in the usual color scheme. We add the in-
jection spectrum of the standard model and the cooled JP spectrum
of the standard model as black dashed line and dotted line, respec-
tively. Recent observations of the large relic in CIZA J2242.8+5301
by Stroe et al. (2016) are added as black diamonds with error bars,
where we convert the observed to rest frame frequencies by multi-
plying by 1+z for all frequencies. We also show the modiﬁcation of
the standard model by the SZ-decrement as dot-dashed black line,
following Brunetti et al. (2013), eq. 1, assuming constant thermal

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–17

pressure in the relic from the values shown in table 1 and consid-
ering a 150 kpc region behind the shock, consistent with the beam
size at 30 GHz (see ﬁg. 5).

As expected, the standard model shows curvature only at low
frequencies and does not reproduce the steepening at the highest
frequencies. Our new models are generally curved outside the fre-
quency range of 610 to 2 GHz. In particular, they show a steepening
at high frequencies. The exponential model is here roughly consis-
tent with the observations of the relic. At intermediate frequencies,
all models reproduce the power-law behaviour expected from the
standard JP-model. At low frequencies all models ﬂatten and the
exponential and linear model are roughly consistent with the data.
For our thermal model and a volume of 2 Mpc x 150 kpc x 260 kpc,
the SZ-decrement does not play a role at 30 GHz.

4.3 Normalized Brightness Proﬁles

For a more detailed comparison with the observed data, we now
consider the radio brightness proﬁles of the relic. We obtain bright-
ness proﬁles using the data available on the ‘Sausage’ relic, which
were previously described in Stroe et al. (2013, 2014, 2016). We
produce images using all the visibilities, using a uniform weighting
to maximise the resolution. To increase signal to noise, we average
along the relic, using circular caps aligned with the shock struc-
ture. This was done in a similar fashion to Figure 20 from Stroe
et al. (2013). This average proﬁle describes an average cut through
the relic tracing the upstream, shock and downstream region. We
note that the relic is, as expected, not perfectly traced by a circle,
so a small amount of averaging across its width will happen. We
calculate the error at each position within the average proﬁle as the
error obtained by averaging over Nbeams number of beams, each
with noise σRMS:

In ﬁgure 5, we show the observed radio proﬁles from Stroe
et al. (2016) at eight observed frequencies, top left to bottom right:
50, 153, 323, 608, 1382, 2274, 16000, 30000 MHz. We convert the
frequencies to the intrinsic frequencies at redshift z = 0.19: 59.50,
182, 384.3, 723.5, 1644, 2703, 19040, 35700 MHz. The standard
model is shown as black line and our new models in the usual
colors. We add the model proﬁles, convolved with the appropriate
beam from the observations. We note that for the new models, the
shock is located at a distance of 0 kpc. In contrast, for the standard
model, the shock is located at 30 kpc.

We ﬁnd a reasonable ﬁt of the exponential model and linear
model at all frequencies. The standard and step model predict ex-
cess emission at low frequencies and large distances. The linear
model predicts a signiﬁcant shift in the position of the brightness
relic at the highest frequencies compared to the lower frequencies.
We note that van Weeren et al. (2010) showed that a broadening at
the rising ﬂank of the proﬁle is consistent with projection effects

into the plane of the sky. All but the exponential model exhibit ex-
cess emission at the lowest frequencies, indicating the best ﬁt of an
exponential decay of the magnetic ﬁeld after the brightness peak.
We conclude that the exponential and linear model are roughly con-
sistent with the data, if the relic extends into the plane of the sky
with an angle Ψ < 10 deg.

colors. We add the standard model with a downwind speed of 1000
km/s as a dashed black line. The error bars on the data include a

10% error in ﬂux scale. We convolve our models with a beam of
16 arcsec. We mark the ﬂattest spectral index expected from simple
DSA (-0.5) as a dotted horizontal line.

Our models are well consistent with the data. The standard
model with 1000 km/s downwind speed is not consistent with the
data. We note that because the spectral index proﬁles are obtained
only from two frequencies, they are very sensitive to errors in the
ﬂux scale and ﬂuctuations/noise present in only one frequency.

For magnetic ﬁelds smaller than BIC (IC dominated cooling),
the shape of the spectral index proﬁle primarily measures the down-
wind speed vdw. Decreasing this quantity will lead to a steepen-
ing in the spectral index proﬁle. In our model, the spectral index
proﬁle strongly disfavours a downwind speed of less than 1000
km/s (black dashed line). This is consistent with models shown in
Stroe et al. (2014), who conclude that the aging requires downwind
speeds not smaller than 1200 km/s. In the absence of additional
physics, recent measurements for the upstream temperature in the
cluster disfavour a scenario with Mach numbers below 4: E.g. a
Mach number of 3.5 would require an upstream temperature above
4 keV to lead to a downwind speed of 1200 km/s. This tempera-
ture is then not consistent with recent X-ray observations that mea-
sure 8 keV downstream (Ogrean et al. 2014; Akamatsu et al. 2015).
These problems could be alleviated by introducing CRe diffusion
away from the shock or ”in situ” re-acceleration downstream, this
is however beyond the aim of our paper (Fujita et al. 2016).

At the same time, however, we note that if we assume the
geometry of our (exponential) model, the temperature and density
jump that are derived from X-ray observations are likely biased low,
due to the expansion downstream, leading to a possible underesti-
mation of the Mach number. Indeed, the downstream temperature
of 8 keV has been measured by Akamatsu et al. (2015) using an
extraction region of the order of Mpc. According to the parame-
ters that we have to assume in order to ﬁt the radio properties of
the relic, namely the e-folding time ≈ 240M yr, the downstream
temperature is expected to decline from 15 to about 8 keV in about
100-150 kpc.

5 DISCUSSION

We ﬁnd that the total integrated synchrotron spectrum is best ﬁt by
an exponential increase in the magnetic ﬁeld by a factor of 5-10
on a scale of deq = 40 kpc in front of the brightness peak of the
relic at 2.1 GHz. This assumes a maximum thickness into the plane
of the sky of < 260 kpc, consistent with previous models. The
exponential model is also roughly consistent with the brightness
proﬁles and the spectral index proﬁle.

The simple relic model, based on a constant magnetic ﬁeld
and diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) from the thermal pool, are
ruled out given the observed spectrum and brightness proﬁles for
our set of parameters. The linear model does not ﬁt the data as well
as the exponential model.

The magnetic ﬁeld strengths proposed here are roughly within
theoretical expectations given the distance from the cluster centre:
Faraday rotation measurements in clusters as well as cosmological
MHD simulations ﬁnd small ﬁelds at cluster outskirts. A correla-
tion of the ICM magnetic ﬁeld with the ICM thermal density nth
exists (Dolag et al. 2001; Donnert et al. 2009):

where it is usually assumed that ξ = 0.5 or ξ = 1. Here r is the ra-
dius from the cluster centre. For the standard β-model inferred from
X-ray observations of clusters and magnetic ﬁeld normalisation
found in the Coma cluster (Bonafede et al. 2010), this motivates
magnetic ﬁelds at the outskirts of the cluster (dcenter = 1.5 Mpc)
of 0.1 − 1.2µG. The ampliﬁcation factor assuming a shock with
Mach number 4.6 is < 3.5 (3.5 for purely perpendicular shocks
where the upstream ﬁeld is perpendicular to the shock normal, and
about 2.3 considering isotropic compression). This means that ad-
ditional mechanisms are necessary to explain the increase of the
magnetic ﬁeld downstream that is required in our model to match
radio data.

5.1 Magnetic Field Increase

In our new models, we assume an ampliﬁcation of the magnetic
ﬁeld by a factor of 5-10 behind the shock on a length scale of
roughly deq ≈ 40 kpc. Unfortunately, the ampliﬁcation of mag-
netic ﬁelds behind shocks in the ICM is not well understood. This
limits us to the following simple energy arguments.

We can compare the energy ﬂux of the shock to the magnetic
energy ﬂux required for the ampliﬁcation. Following Finoguenov
et al. (2010), the energy ﬂux available at the shock is given by:

where ρup = 3.04 × 10−28 g/cm3 is the upstream density and

sec

An interesting outcome of this scenario is that during the ini-
tial phases of ampliﬁcation the magnetic ﬁeld topology is highly
turbulent, the Alfvenic Mach number being very large.

This implies that the synchrotron emission at higher frequen-
cies is not expected to be strongly polarised. On the contrary,
stronger polarization is expected when the magnetic ﬁeld reaches
quasi-equipartition, at scales ≈ deq, where the bulk of the emis-
sion at lower (GHz) frequencies is produced in a strong ﬁeld that is
advected and possibly stirred downstream. Hence in our model, in-
trinsic polarisation in the relic depends on distance from the shock
and frequency. This prediction can be tested with modern radio in-
terferometers.

5.2 Magnetic Field Decrease

The magnetic ﬁeld decrease is constrained by the decline in bright-
ness behind the peak of the emission in the relic. The effect of the
magnetic ﬁeld itself on the CRe cooling is rather small, hence the
ﬁeld is constrained well, especially at low frequencies, where CRe
cool slowly.

Several mechanisms may contribute to this decline, dissipa-
tion of turbulent motions, magnetic reconnection or adiabatic ex-
pansion. We limit our considerations here to the latter, because it is
physically unavoidable and easy to model.

Our best-ﬁt exponential model self-consistently includes adi-
abatic expansion along the shock normal. This result suggests that
expansion indeed plays an important role in shaping the relic emis-
sion. The linear model reproduces the brightness proﬁles nearly as
well, however with more dissipation of magnetic energy. The data
at 150 MHz rule out the standard model with constant density and
a constant magnetic ﬁeld of 5 µG.

This provides a condition between turbulent efﬁciency and dynamo
that is satisﬁed under our assumptions. As soon as the energy den-
sity of magnetic ﬁelds reaches a substantial fraction of the en-
ergy associated with turbulent motions (i.e. for MA reaching unity)
magnetic ﬁeld tension prevents turbulent motions and the ampliﬁ-
cation process slows down. In our scenario this situation would be
realised at distance ∼ deq, at these distances magnetic ﬁeld energy
density saturates and the ﬁeld strength starts declining due to adi-
abatic expansion. Above estimates demonstrate that the magnetic
ﬁeld luminosity required by the model is not in conﬂict with basic
energy constraints, turbulent scales and relevant time-scales.

6 ACCELERATION EFFICIENCY IN THE NORTHERN

RELIC OF CIZA J2242.8+5301

We now derive the required CRe density at injection using the new
models for the underlying magnetic ﬁeld. We also set constrains on
the pre-existing CRe population required for shock re-acceleration
to be efﬁcient.

We can estimate the injection efﬁciency of relativistic particles
behind the shock directly from our models. To do so, we ﬁrst have
to deﬁne a minimum momentum of cosmic-rays to consider. We set

, where 2F1(a, b; c; x) is the hypergeometric function (Abramowitz
& Stegun 1970). From the shock properties we ﬁnd a down-
stream thermal number density of nth,dw = 5.6 × 10−4 cm−3
and a thermal energy density of th,dw = 3ndwkBoltzT = 6 ×
10−11erg/cm3. The injection efﬁciency relative to energy ﬂux of
the shock ηﬂux then follows by multiplying the CRe energy density
eq. 40 with the shock speed in the upstream medium.

We give our values for the normalisation, CRe number density,
CRe energy density and injection efﬁciency before cooling in table
3. The energy densities are larger than in scenarios of SNR, where
proton to electron ratios of Xp/e < 0.01 were found (Morlino &
Caprioli 2012).

6.1 Shock Re-acceleration

Adiabatic compression of a pre-existing CRe population can possi-
bly solve the efﬁciency problems encountered in recent models for
relics (Kang & Ryu 2015). Here we derive constrains on the energy
density of pre-existing CRes before the shock in the northern relic
of CIZA J2242.8+5301.

In DSA simulations, the efﬁciency for CRe injection ηKR in
the frame of the upstream medium is deﬁned as (Kang & Ryu
2013):

ηKR(M ) =

2vdw

ρupv3

shock

CRe,dw − CRe,up

where γCR = 4/3 is the adiabatic index of CRe and CRe,up and
CRe,dw are the upstream and downstream CRe energy densities,
respectively.

In ﬁgure 7 we show the required acceleration efﬁciency
ηKR(M ) over the energy density in CRe ahead of the shock
CRe,up for the relic. We plot the upstream CRe energy density
in units of the upstream thermal energy density. For energy den-
sities of 0.1 percent the required efﬁciency drops very quickly for
all models, because of adiabatic gains in energy. This compression
sets an upper limit on the pre-existing CRe energy density before
the shock, less than one percent of the upstream thermal energy
density all models.

This demonstrates that compression can reduce the required
energy ﬂux and solve the acceleration efﬁciency problem, even if
only very moderate amounts of CRe are present in front of the
shock (Kang & Ryu 2015). As shown in section 2.2, CRe lifetimes
at the location of the relic are around half a Hubble time, thus a
radio dark population of CRe can accumulate in the outskirts of a
cluster during its formation from z = 1. This pre-existing population
of CRe is likely to have low momenta between 10 and 100 mec, be-
cause at these momenta the lifetime shown in ﬁgure 1 peaks. For

the reasonable assumption of turbulent diffusion of CRe, this also
means large diffusion lengths in the Mpc regime and smooth spatial
distributions of the population.

This scenario differs from the scenario of localized ”CRe
clouds” deposited by radio galaxies and re-accelerated by shocks
to form relics (e.g. Kang & Ryu 2015, 2016). The two scenarios
could explain the morphological differences between the northern
and the southern relic in CIZA J2242.8+5301: The northern source
population of CRe was accumulated over Gyrs and hence is smooth
and leads to the observed regular relic morphology, while the south-
ern source population is younger and originates from outﬂows of
nearby radio galaxies.

In the centre of clusters, lifetimes less than one Gyr imply that
quiet or cool core clusters can in principle be rather depleted of
CRe even at these low energies, potentially making relic formation
from an old population more difﬁcult.

6.2 Comparison to Previous Models

In their discovery paper, van Weeren et al. (2010) modelled the
relic with 5 µG, a shock speed of 1000 km/s and a Mach number of
4.6. In a more recent study, Stroe et al. (2014) conducted detailed

ﬁeld of 6 µG. They ﬁnd a best ﬁt of a lower Mach number of 2.9
and aging speeds around 905 km/sec, however leaving the CRe
normalisation n0 a free parameter. We stress that their formalism
is fundamentally different from the approach taken in this work,
where we assume a time independent CRe normalisation n0 along
the shock normal.

Assuming our formalism, we show the total synchrotron spec-
trum from both models alongside the observed spectrum from Stroe
et al. (2016) in ﬁgure 8. Both parameter sets do not ﬁt the steepen-
ing above 3 GHz as expected. van Weeren et al. (2010)’s model
gives a good ﬁt to the data below 3 GHz, while Stroe et al. (2014)
model is too steep and does not ﬁt the data at 150 and 320 MHz,
probably because we left n0 constant downstream. See also ap-
pendix B.

7 CONCLUSIONS

We have proposed to attribute the spectral steepening in radio relics
to higher energy cosmic-ray electrons preferentially emitting in
lower magnetic ﬁelds than the bulk of the CRe. We then presented
a ﬁrst model for a radio relic considering time dependent magnetic
ﬁelds and adiabatic expansion of the thermal plasma behind the
shock. Our model requires a gradual ampliﬁcation of the magnetic
ﬁeld in a small region downstream of the shock and exceeds ex-
pected ﬁeld strengths at the shock due to compression.

We focused our efforts on the prototype of radio relics, the
”Sausage” relic in CIZA J2242.8+5301. We developed the formal-
ism to obtain cooling CRe spectra and synchrotron spectra for such
models. Considering standard parameters for the northern shock in
CIZA J2242.8+5301, we ﬁnd that

(i) the standard model of the relic using a constant magnetic
ﬁeld of 5 µG is inconsistent with the observed brightness proﬁle at
150 MHz. The standard downstream speed of 1000 km/s is incon-
sistent with the spectral index proﬁles between 150 and 610 MHz.
The proﬁles support a downstream speed of 1200 km/s.

(ii) Behind the brightness peak, we ﬁnd a best ﬁt model where
the magnetic ﬁeld declines exponentially alongside adiabatic ex-
pansion of the gas with an e-fold distance of 240 kpc.

(iii) the observed radio synchrotron spectrum and the brightness
proﬁles are consistent with a shock Mach number of 4.6 and an ex-
ponentially increasing magnetic ﬁeld from 0.3 to 3.0 µG in the 40
kpc before the brightness peak. The model predicts a shift in the
brightness peak of the relic observing frequencies above 16 GHz.
It also predicts that intrinsic polarised intensity depends on the dis-
tance from the shock and on observing frequency, which can be
used to falsify the model observationally.

(iv) an interpretation of the increase as a turbulent dynamo,
caused by a short burst of turbulence, yields an injection scale of
about 10 kpc, if 5 % of the shock energy is converted into turbu-
lence and 5% of the turbulent energy drives the dynamo. We have
also shown that the picture does not appear inconsistent with rele-
vant quantities and time-scales.

(v) relatively large acceleration efﬁciencies are required by our
model provided that electrons are accelerated from the thermal
pool. However, plausible energy densities (< 1%) of pre-existing
CRe before the shock can at least reduce the required efﬁciency,
due to adiabatic compression by the shock. We ﬁnd such a scenario
well motivated: The expected lifetime of CRe in the cluster out-
skirts is very long: ≈ 7 Gyrs at 100 mec. Hence, CRe are able to
accumulate over the lifetime of the cluster in its outskirts as well.

APPENDIX A: BRIGHTNESS PROFILES

For completeness, we report here the brightness proﬁles reported
in ﬁgure 5 without convolving with the observed beam. In ﬁgure
A1, we show these predicted relic brightness in arbitrary units over
distance. In the third panel we also show the deconvolved proﬁle
observed at 610 MHz from van Weeren et al. (2010) as black dia-
monds. In that panel we also plot the exponential model convolved
with a Gaussian with FWHM of 12 kpc. We ﬁnd a reasonable match
to the deconvolved observed proﬁle at 610 MHz, especially con-
sidering that the deconvolution is probably not perfect. At frequen-
cies above 2 GHz the predicted relic emission becomes only a few
ten kpc wide. Additionally, the linear model predicts a shift in the
brightness peak at these frequencies compared to frequencies below
2 GHz. This motivates high resolution observations of the Sausage
or similar relics to observe the shift in the brightness proﬁle.

APPENDIX B: A MODEL WITH LOWER MACH
NUMBER

In section we show results from a model with Mach number of
M = 3. This is motivated by X-ray observations, which suggest a
shock weaker than that adopted in our paper, speciﬁcally M (cid:54) 3
(e.g. Akamatsu et al. 2015).
The normalisations (n0) used in this model are 5.4 × 10−4,
16 × 10−4, 160 × 10−4 and 18 × 10−4 in the same units3 as in
table 3, for the standard, step, exponential and linear energy model,
respectively.

In ﬁgure B1, we show the integrated radio spectrum, the con-
volved brightness proﬁle at 150 MHz and 610 MHz and the spectral
index proﬁle of the models using a Mach number of M = 3, from
top left to bottom right. We employ a magnetic ﬁeld minimum of
0.3 µG and a maximum of 3 µG. We require saturation scales of
15, 19, 37 and 52 kpc for the four models, respectively. The val-
ues for the ﬁeld and the saturation scale are partially degenerate, as
shown in appendix C. Hence, a lower Bmin does not lead to a better
overall ﬁt of the model.

The total integrated radio spectrum is ﬁt well above 1 GHz
by all but the standard model. However, all models are inconsis-
tent with the observed radio spectrum at low frequencies. For the
exponential model we used an e-folding distance of the adiabatic
expansion of 80 kpc. We refrain from lowering this parameter even
further to ensure deq (cid:28) texpvdw

The convolved brightness proﬁle at 150 MHz and 610 MHz
is compared with model predictions in the top right and bottom
left panels. The exponential model declines too quickly due to the
combined effect of adiabatic expansion and small downstream ve-
locity. It also shows a signiﬁcant shift in the brightness peak, not
consistent with the observations.

Finally the comparison with the spectral index proﬁle is very

3 Note that the energy densities associated with these normalisations are
larger than for the M = 4.6 model, because of the change in spectral index.

instructive. All models show a steepening of the spectrum with dis-
tance that is stronger than the observed one. The steepening with
distance constrains the velocity of the ﬂow downstream, which is
only 900 km/s for a Mach number of M = 3. As we explained in
sect. 4.4 a minimum downstream velocity of vdw = 1200 km/s is
required to explain observations.

We conclude that a model with a Mach number of three is
disfavoured by radio observations, unless additional mechanisms
that maintain CR electrons at higher energies for longer times (e.g.
re-acceleration) or that enhance the spatial transport of high energy
electrons (e.g. diffusion) are considered.

APPENDIX C: DEPENDENCE ON MODEL
PARAMETERS

In this section, we explore the parameter space of the exponential
model, to show the importance of the individual input parameters.
These are :

• the minimum magnetic ﬁeld value: Bmin,
• the maximum magnetic ﬁeld value: Bmax,
• the saturation distance: deq,
• the shock speed: vdw.

We conclude that the e-fold distance is degenerate with the
downwind speed. Hence, given a shock speed, the e-fold distance
can always be found so the model brightness proﬁles ﬁt the ob-

served proﬁles. We keep the Mach number ﬁxed at 4.6, a model
with M = 3 was considered above.

In what follows, we present the total integrated synchrotron
spectrum and the two brightness proﬁles at 150 MHz and 610 MHz
varying one parameter, while leaving the other three ﬁxed. The ex-
ponential model with standard values is always shown in black, the
lower value in green and the upper value in blue.

C1 Minimum Magnetic Field Value

We ﬁrst consider the minimum magnetic ﬁeld strength in the expo-
nential model. For the three values of Bmin, 0.15, 0.3 and 0.6 µG
we show brightness proﬁles at two frequencies and the total syn-
chrotron spectrum in ﬁgure C1. This parameter has two effects on
the observables: An increase in Bmin increases the brightness at the
rising ﬂank of the proﬁle, most signiﬁcantly at low frequencies. It
also decreases the steepening of the spectrum at high radio frequen-
cies. Given the magnetic ﬁeld values expected at the location of the
relic, smaller values than 0.1 µG are difﬁcult to justify behind the
shock.

C2 Maximum Magnetic Field Value

Next we vary the maximum magnetic ﬁeld strength Bmax, which
is 3 µG in the standard model (black), to 2 µG (green) and 6 µG
(blue). The lower limit is here set by the inverse Compton limit, the
higher value is consistent with the standard model from van Weeren
et al. (2010).

Figure C1. Beam convolved brightness proﬁles at 150 MHz and 610 MHz and integrated synchrotron spectrum (top left to bottom right) for the exponential
model with minimum magnetic ﬁeld Bmin equal to 0.3 µG (standard model, black), 0.15 µG (green) and 0.6 µG (blue).

Figure C2. Beam convolved brightness proﬁles at 150 MHz and 610 MHz and integrated synchrotron spectrum (top left to bottom right) for the exponential
model with minimum magnetic ﬁeld Bmax equal to 3 µG (standard model, black), 2 µG (green) and 6 µG (blue).

We conclude that shock speed and saturation distance have the
largest impact on the model. The saturation distance can in princi-
ple be well constrained by very high resolution observation of the
relic at intermediate frequencies. The down stream shock speed is
highly uncertain as it depends on the Mach number, the expansion
timescale and the upstream sound speed, which in turn depends on
the upstream temperatures.

The resulting brightness proﬁles and radio synchrotron spec-
trum are shown in ﬁgure C2. The major impact of the parameter
is visible in the normalisation of the radio synchrotron spectrum,
where the low and high models show a shift in the model spectrum.
This would reduce (increase) the CRe normalisation and required
acceleration efﬁciencies.The changes to the brightness proﬁles are
minor and roughly within the error bars of the observations. We
conclude that the maximum magnetic ﬁeld strength mostly affects
the normalisation of the CRe spectrum and has only minor inﬂu-
ence on the brightness proﬁle.

C3 Saturation Distance

In ﬁgure C3 we show brightness proﬁles and synchrotron spectrum,
varying the saturation distance deq by 20%, from 37 kpc, to 29 kpc
(green) and 44 kpc (blue). The change leads to a shift in the peak
of the brightness proﬁles by roughly 10 kpc and an decrease (in-
crease) in the steepening of radio spectrum and high frequencies
for smaller (larger) saturation distances. We conclude that this pa-
rameter has a rather large impact on the model. In the absence of
any projection effects it could be constrained very well by the ob-
served high resolution brightness proﬁles.

C4 Downwind Speed

We consider the downstream shock speed vdw as the ﬁnal param-
eter, again changing it by 20% to 1421 km/s (blue) or 950 km/s
(green). The change leads to a shift in the peak position of the
brightness proﬁles to larger (green) or smaller (blue) distances. The
change in cooling velocity also leads to an increase (decrease) for
smaller (larger) of the spectral steepening, respectively.
