Cellular approximations of fusion systems

Nat`alia Castellana∗ and Alberto Gavira-Romero†

Abstract

In this paper we study the cellularization of classifying spaces of saturated fusion
systems over ﬁnite p-groups with respect to classifying spaces of ﬁnite p-groups. We
give explicit criteria to decide when a classifying space is cellular and we explicitly
compute the cellularization for a family of exotic examples.

1 Introduction

The transfer plays an important role both in stable homotopy theory of classifying spaces
and group cohomology. Given a ﬁnite group G and a prime p, if S is a Sylow p-subgroup,
the properties of the transfer imply that the mod p cohomology of G injects into the mod
p cohomology of S. In stable homotopy theory, the spectrum of BG∧
p is a retract of the
spectrum of BS and the splitting is constructed by an idempotent in stable selfmaps of the
spectrum of BS.

In 1990s, E. Dror-Farjoun and W. Chach ´olski generalized the concept of CW-complex,
spaces build from spheres by means pointed homotopy colimits. Let A be a pointed space
and let C(A) denote the smallest collection of pointed spaces that contains A and it is closed
by weak equivalences and pointed homotopy colimits. A pointed space X is A-cellular if
X ∈ C(A). These concepts are also deﬁned in stable homotopy category.

In the stable context, the fact that BG∧

belongs to C(Σ∞

In unstable homotopy theory of classifying spaces, BG∧

The homotopy type of BG∧

p is determined by the p-local structure of G, the fusion system
associated to G. Given a ﬁnite p-group S, p a prime, a fusion system over S is a subcategory
of the category of groups whose objects are the subgroup of S and morphisms are given
a set of injective homomorphisms, containing those which are induced by conjugation by
elements of S. A fusion system F is saturated if it veriﬁes certain axioms such as would be
holded if S were a Sylow p-subgroup of a ﬁnite group. These ideas were developed by L.
Puig in an unpublished notes. Afterwards, D. Benson suggested the idea of associating a

“classifying space” to each saturated fusion system (see [Ben98]). The notion of classifying
space was formulated by C. Broto, R. Levi and B. Oliver in [BLO03b], where the notion of
“centric linking system” (or “p-local ﬁnite group”) associated to saturated fusion systems
appears. At that time, it was not known if every saturated fusion has an associated linking
system.

K. Ragnarsson [Rag06] constructed a classifying space spectrum BF associated to F
by splitting the spectrum of BS via an idempotent stable selfmap. Analogously to the
situation for ﬁnite groups, we have then BF ∈ C(BS).

Recently, A. Chermak [Che13] has proved the existence and uniqueness of centric link-
ing systems, that means, each saturated fusion system F has a unique (up to isomorphism)
centric linking system associated to F , and so a unique (up to homotopy equivalence) clas-
sifying space BF . See Section 2 for speciﬁc deﬁnitions, details and main results which we
will use in the rest of the paper about fusion systems.

Previous works in ﬁnite groups (see [Flo07], [FS07] and [FF11]) suggest the strong
p with respect to classifying spaces of

relationship between the cellularity properties of BG∧
ﬁnite p-groups and the fusion structure of G at the prime p.

Let P be a ﬁnite p-group, we will denote by ClF (P) the smallest strongly F -closed
subgroup in S which contains all the images of homomorphisms P → S (see Section 3
below). The main result of this paper is the following theorem.

Theorem 5.1. Let F be a saturated fusion system over a ﬁnite p-group S and let P be a ﬁnite
p-group. Then BF is BP-cellular if and only if S = ClF (P).

Corollary 5.2. Let (S, F ) be a saturated fusion system and P a ﬁnite p-group.

(a) The classifying space BF is BS-cellular.

(b) Let (S, F ′) be a saturated fusion system with F ⊂ F ′. If BF is BP-cellular then BF ′ is also

BP-cellular.

(c) Let A be a pointed connected space. If ClF ((π1A)ab) = S, then BF is A-cellular.

(d) Let Ωpm(S) be the (normal) subgroup of S generated by its elements of order pi, which i ≤ m.
Then BF is BZ/pm-cellular if and only if S = ClF (Ωpm(S)). In particular, there is a non-
negative integer m0 ≥ 0 such that BF is BZ/pm-cellular for all m ≥ m0.

There exists an augmented idempotent endofunctor CWA : Spaces∗ → Spaces∗ such
that for all pointed space X, the space CWAX is A-cellular and the augmention map
cX : CWAX → X is an A-equivalence, that means, it is induced a weak equivalence in
/map∗(A, X). Roughly speaking, CWAX
pointed mapping space (cX)∗ : map∗(A, CWAX)
is the best A-cellular approximation of X. We will say that CWAX is the A-cellularization
of X and the map cX : CWAX → X is the A-cellular approximation of X. See [DF96] for more
details about the construction and main properties of the functor CWA.

The strategy of proof of Theorem 5.1 is the analysis of the Chach ´olski ﬁbration to
compute CWBP(BF ) which is described in [Cha96]. Let C be the homotopy coﬁbre of

the evaluation map ev : W[BP,BF ]∗ BP → BF , then CWBP(BF ) is the homotopy ﬁbre of the

2

composite r : BF → C → PΣBPC, where PΣBP denotes the ΣBP-nulliﬁcation functor deﬁned
by A. K. Bousﬁeld in [Bou94]. We prove that CWBP(BF ) ≃ BF if and only if the map r∧
p
is null-homotopic (see the proof of Theorem 5.1). Therefore, the BP-cellularity of BF is
equivalent to the homotopy nullity of the map r∧
p .

To approach this question, we study the kernel of r∧

p in the sense of D. Notbohm
introduced in [Not94] for maps from classifying spaces of compact Lie groups (Section 3).
Given a map f : BF → Z, where Z is a connected p-complete and ΣBZ/p-null space (that
is, Z∧
p ≃ Z and map∗(ΣBZ/p, Z) ≃ ∗), then ker( f ) := {x ∈ S | f |Bhxi ≃ ∗}. We show that ker( f )
is a strongly F -closed subgroup of S (Proposition 3.5) with the following main property.

Theorem 3.6. Let (S, F ) be a saturated fusion system. Let Z be a connected p-complete and
ΣBZ/p-null space. A map f : BF → Z is null-homotopic if and only if ker( f ) = S.

Furthermore, any strongly F -closed subgroup K ≤ S is the kernel of a map from BF

to B(Σ|S/K| ≀ Σpm )∧

p for certain m ≥ 0 (Proposition 3.7).

In Section 4 we study homotopy properties of CWBP(BF ) needed for the proof of the
main theorem. Section 5 contains the proof of Theorem 5.1. A key step is the computation
of the kernel of r∧
p .
Proposition 5.5. Let (S, F ) be a saturated fusion system. Then ker(r∧

p ) = ClF (P).

The last two sections are devoted to give explicit examples. Concretely, in Section 6 we
describe a strategy to compute the BP-cellularization of BF when S , ClF (P). This is the
p : BF ′ →
case when we have a homotopy factorization of r∧
(PΣBPC)∧
p with trivial kernel (verifying certain technical conditions in Proposition 6.2). This
is the case when ClF (S) is normal in F .

p : BF → (PΣBPC)∧

p by a map ˜r∧

Corollary 6.5. Let (S, F ) be a fusion system and let P be a ﬁnite p-group. If ClF (P) ⊳ F , then
CWBP(BF ) is homotopy equivalent to the homotopy ﬁbre of BF → B(F /ClF (P)).

This result allow us compute, for all r ≥ 1, the BZ/pr-cellularation of the classifying
space of Z/pn ≀ Z/q, with p , q, and of the Suzuki group Sz(2n), with n an odd integer at
least 3 (Example 6.6).

The last section contains an explicit description of the BZ/3l-cellularation of the clas-
sifying space of a family of exotic fusion systems over a ﬁnite 3-group given in [DRV07].

Corollary 7.1. Let F be an exotic fusion system over B(3, r; 0, γ, 0) such that F has at least one
F -Alperin rank two elementary abelian 3-subgroup given in [DRV07, Theorem 5.10]. Then

(i) If γ = 0, then BF is BZ/3l-cellular for all l ≥ 1.

(ii) Assume γ , 0. Then BF is BZ/3l-cellular if and only if l ≥ 2. If l = 1, ClF (Z/3) = hs, s2i.

Moreover, when γ , 0 and l = 1, we show that CWBZ/3(BF ) is the homotpy ﬁbre of a

map BF → (BΣ3)∧

2 Preliminaries on the homotopy theory of fusion systems

A saturated fusion system is a small subcategory of the category of groups which encodes
fusion/conjugacy data between subgroups of a ﬁxed ﬁnite p-group S, as formalized by L.
Puig (see [Pui06] and also [AKO11]). Such objects have classifying spaces which satisfy
many of the rigid homotopy theoretic properties of p-completed classifying spaces of ﬁnite
groups, as generalized by C. Broto, R. Levi and B. Oliver (see [BLO03b]).

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let S be a ﬁnite p-group. A saturated fusion system on S is a subcategory F
of the category of groups with Ob(F ) the set of all subgroups of S and such that it satisﬁes
the following properties. For all P, Q ≤ S:

( f.1) HomS(P, Q) ⊂ HomF (P, Q) ⊂ Inj(P, Q); and

( f.2) each ϕ ∈ HomF (P, Q) is the composite of an isomorphism in F followed by an

inclusion.

For all P ≤ S and all P′ ≤ S which is F -conjugate to P (P and P′ are isomorphic as objects

in F ):

(s.1) For all P ≤ S which is fully normalized in F (i.e. |NS(P)| ≥ |NS(P′)| for all P′ F -conjugate
to P), P is also fully centralized in F (|CS(P)| ≥ |CS(P′)| for all P′ F -conjugate to P), and
OutS(P) ∈ Sylp(OutF (P)).

(s.2) Let P ≤ S and ϕ ∈ HomF (P, S) be such that ϕ(P) is fully centralized. If we set

Nϕ = {g ∈ NS(P) | ϕcgϕ−1 ∈ AutS(ϕ(P))},

then there is ¯ϕ ∈ HomF (Nϕ, S) such that ¯ϕ|P = ϕ.

The standard example is given by the fusion category of a ﬁnite group G. Given a ﬁnite
group G with a ﬁxed Sylow p-subgroup S, let FS(G) be the category with MorFS(G)(P, Q) =
HomG(P, Q) for all P, Q ≤ S, where HomG(P, Q) = {ϕ ∈ Hom(P, Q) | ϕ = cg for some g ∈ G}.
This category FS(G) satisﬁes the saturation axioms (see [BLO03b, Proposition 1.3]).

In order to recover the homotopy type of the Bousﬁel-Kan p-completion of the classi-
fying space BG∧
p , Broto-Levi-Oliver [BLO03a] introduce a new category deﬁned using the
group G. A p-subgroup P ≤ G is p-centric if Z(P′) is a Sylow p-subgroup of CG(P′) for all
P′ G-conjugate to P. Let LS(G) be the category whose objects are p-centric subgroups of
G with MorLS(G)(P, Q) = {x ∈ G | xP−1x ≤ Q}/Op(CG(P)) for all P, Q ≤ S. In [BLO03a] the
authors proved that the classifying space of this p-local structure is |LS(G)|∧
p . This
new structure one can associate to a ﬁnite group can also be generalized in the context of
abstract fusion systems.

p ≃ BG∧

Deﬁnition 2.2. [BLO03b] Let F be a saturated fusion system over a ﬁnite p-group S.
A centric linking system associated to F is a category L whose objects are the F -centric
subgroups of S (i.e., the subgroups P ≤ S such that CS(P) = Z(P)), together with a functor
π : L → F c, and “distinguished” monomorphisms δP : P → AutL(P) for each F -centric
subgroup P ≤ S, which satisﬁes the following conditions:

(l.1) π is the identity on objects and surjective on morphisms. For each pair of objects
P, Q ≤ L, Z(P) acts freely on MorL(P, Q) by composition (upon identifying Z(P) with
δP(Z(P)) ≤ AutL(P)), and π induces a bijection

MorL(P, Q)/Z(P)

(cid:27) /

/HomF (P, Q).

(l.2) For each F -centric subgroup P ≤ S and each g ∈ P, π sends δP(g) ∈ AutL(P) to

cg ∈ AutF (P).

(l.3) For each f ∈ MorL(P, Q) and each g ∈ P, f ◦ δP(g) = δQ(π f (g)) ◦ f .

Recently, in 2013, A. Chermak [Che13] proved the existence and uniqueness of centric

linking systems associated to saturated fusion systems (see also [Oli13]).

Theorem 2.3. ([Che13],[Oli13]) Let F be a saturated fusion system on a ﬁnite p-group S. Then
there exists a centric linking system L associated to F . Moreover, L is uniquely determined by F
up to isomorphism.

Deﬁnition 2.4. The classifying space BF of a saturated fusion system (S, F ) is the Bousﬁeld-
Kan p-completion of the nerve of the associated centric linking system |L|∧
p . We denote by
Θ : BS → BF the map induced by the distinguished monomorphism δS.

Given a map f : BF → X and P ≤ S, we denote by f |BP the composite f ◦ Θ ◦ Bi where

i : P ≤ S.

We describe some results concerning the homotopy type of the classifying space BF

and mapping spaces map(BP, BF ) which will be used in the rest of the paper.

Proposition 2.5 ([BLO03b],[BCG+07],[CL09]). For any satured fusion system (S, F ), BF is a
p-complete space and πi(BF ) are ﬁnite p-groups for all i ≥ 1. The fundamental group π1(BF ) (cid:27)
S/Op

F (S) := h[Q, Op(AutF (Q))] | Q ≤ Si.

F (S), where Op

Proof. The description of the fundamental group π1(BF ) is given in [BCG+07, Theorem
B]. The fact that BF is p-complete follows from [BK72, Proposition I.5.2] since the nerve of
the associated linking system |L| is p-good by [BLO03b, Proposition 1.12]. Finally, πi(BF )
are ﬁnite p-groups for all i ≥ 1 by [CL09, Lemma 7.6].

(cid:3)

Proposition 2.6. [BLO03b, Theorem 6.3] Let (S, F ) be a saturated fusion system.
If P is a
ﬁnite p-group and ρ : P → S a group homomorphism such that ρ(P) is fully F -centralized, there
≃
→
is a saturated fusion system (CS(ρ(P)), CF (ρ(P))) and a homotopy equivalence BCF (ρ(P))
map(BP, BF )ρ. In particular, the evaluation map(BP, BF )c → BF is a homotopy equivalence.

Moreover, any ﬁnite covering of the classifying space of a saturated fusion system is

again the classifying space of a saturated fusion system.
Theorem 2.7 ([BCG+07, Theorem A]). Let (S, F ) be a saturated fusion system and L be the
associated linking system. Then there is a normal subgroup H ⊳ π1|L| which is minimal among
all those whose quotient is ﬁnite and p-solvable. Any covering space of the geometric realization
|L| whose fundamental group contains H is homotopy equivalent to |L′| for some linking system
L′ associated to a saturated fusion system (S′, F ′), where S′ ≤ S and F ′ ≤ F .

In this work it is important to understand the homotopy properties of mapping spaces
between classifying paces. This question was already studied in [BLO03b]. One of the
standard techniques used when studying maps between p-completed classifying spaces
of ﬁnite groups is to replace them by the p-completion of a homotopy colimit of classifying
spaces of subgroups.

Deﬁnition 2.8. Let F be a saturated fusion system over a ﬁnite p-group S. The orbit category
of F is the category O(F ) whose objects are the subgroups of S, and whose morphisms
are deﬁned by

MorO(F )(P, Q) = RepF (P, Q) := Inn(Q)/ HomF (P, Q).

We let Oc(F ) denote the full subcategory of O(F ) whose objects are the F -centric subgroups
of S. If L is a centric linking system associated to F , then ˜π denotes the composite functor

˜π : L π /

/ F c

/ Oc(F ).

The homotopy type of the nerve of a centric linking system can be described as a

homotopy colimit over the orbit category.

Proposition 2.9 ([BLO03b, Proposition 2.2]). Fix a saturated fusion system F over a ﬁnite p-
group S and an associated centric linking system L, and let ˜π → Oc(F ) be the projection functor.
Let ˜B : Oc(F ) → Top be the left homotopy Kan extension over ˜π of the constant functor L ∗ /
/Top.
Then ˜B is a lift of the classifying space functor P 7→ BP to the category of topological spaces, and

|L| ≃ hocolimOc(F )( ˜B).

Given fusion systems F and F ′ on S and S′ respectively, a homomorphism ψ : S → S′
is called fusion preserving if for every ϕ ∈ F (P, Q) there exists some ϕ′ ∈ F ′(ψ(P), ψ(Q))
such that ψ ◦ ϕ = ϕ′ ◦ ψ.
Theorem 2.10 ([CL09, Theorem 1.3]). Let (S, F ) and (S′, F ′) be saturated fusion systems.
Suppose that ρ : S → S′ is a fusion preserving homomorphism. Then there exists some m ≥ 0 and
a map ˜f : BF → B(F ′ ≀ Σpm) such that the diagram below commutes up to homotopy

3 The kernel of a map from a classifying space

Given a connected space A, we say that a space X is A-null if the evaluation map
ev : map(A, X) → X is a weak equivalence (see [DF96]).
If X is connected, X is A-null
iﬀ map∗(A, X) is weakly contractible. There is a nulliﬁcation functor PA : Spaces → Spaces
with a natural transformation ηX : X → PA(X) which is initial with respect to maps into
A-null spaces. We say that X is A-acyclic if PAX ≃ ∗.

The kernel of a map f : BG∧

p → Z, where G is a compact Lie group and Z is a connected p-
complete ΣBZ/p-null space, is deﬁned by D. Notbohm in [Not94]. We adapt his deﬁnition
to our context.

Deﬁnition 3.1. Let (S, F ) be a saturated fusion system and let Z be a connected p-complete
ΣBZ/p-null space. If f : BF → Z is a pointed map, we deﬁne the kernel of f

ker( f ) := {g ∈ S | f |Bhgi ≃ ∗}.

Remark 3.2. By Proposition 2.6, we have map(BZ/p, BF )c ≃ BF . It follows then by looping
that ΩBF is BZ/p-null, or equivalently, that BF is ΣBZ/p-null ([DF96, 3.A.1]).
Remark 3.3. If X is a BZ/p-null space, then X is BP-null for any ﬁnite p-group P. There
are weak equivalences map∗(BP, X) ≃ map∗(PBZ/p(BP), X) ≃ ∗, where the last equivalence
follows from Lemma 6.13 in [Dwy96] which states that BP is BZ/p-acyclic. A direct proof
can be obtained by induction using the central extension of a p-group and Zabrodsky’s
Lemma [Dwy96, Proposition 3.4].

We will show that ker( f ) is a subgroup of S with some important properties.

Deﬁnition 3.4. Let F be a fusion system over a ﬁnite p-group S. Then a subgroup K ≤ S
is strongly F -closed if for all P ≤ K and all morphism ϕ : P → S in F we have ϕ(P) ≤ K.

If G is a ﬁnite group and S ∈ Sylp(G), K ≤ S is strongly FS(G)-closed if and only if K is

strongly closed in G, i.e., if for all k ∈ K and g ∈ G such that cg(s) ∈ S, then cg(s) ∈ K.

Since the intersection of strongly F -closed subgroups is again strongly F -closed, given
a ﬁnite p-group P, we deﬁne ClF (P) to be the smallest strongly F -closed subgroup of S
that contains f (P) for all f ∈ Hom(P, S).

Proposition 3.5. Let f : BF → Z be a pointed map as in Deﬁnition 3.1. The kernel ker( f ) is a
strongly F -closed subgroup of S.
Proof. Since hxi = hx−1i, in order to show that ker( f ) is a subgroup of S it is suﬃcient to
prove that if x, y ∈ ker( f ), then xy ∈ ker( f ). The composite Bhx, yi → BS → BF → Z is
null-homotopic by [Not94, Proposition 2.4]. Since hxyi ֒→ hx, yi, f |Bhxyi ≃ ∗.

Let P ≤ ker( f ) and ϕ ∈ HomF (P, S). We have the following homotopy commutative

W. Dwyer shows in [Dwy96, Theorem 5.1] that if we have a ﬁnite group G, a map
p → Z as in Deﬁnition 3.1 is null-homotopic if and only if ker( f ) = S. This statement

f : BG∧
is also true for classifying spaces of saturated fusion systems.

Theorem 3.6. Let (S, F ) be a saturated fusion system. Let Z be a connected p-complete ΣBZ/p-
null space. Then a map f : BF → Z is null-homotopic if and only if ker( f ) = S.

Proof. If f ≃ ∗, then f |BS ≃ ∗ and therefore ker( f ) = S. Now assume that f |BS ≃ ∗, we will
show that f ≃ ∗.
Step 1: Assume that π1(Z) is abelian. By Proposition 2.9, BF ≃ (hocolimOc(F ) ˜BP)∧
p , where
˜BP ≃ BP for P ∈ F c. Since any map BP → BF factors through Θ : BS → BF by [BLO03b,
Theorem 4.4], f |BP ≃ ∗ for all P ∈ F c. Therefore we have two maps

hocolimOc(F )( ˜BP)

/ (hocolimOc(F )( ˜BP))∧

/ Z ,

such that both are nullhomotopic when restricted to BP for all P ∈ F c.

The obstructions for these maps to be homotopic are in limi

Oc(F ) πi(map(BP, Z)c), for
i ≥ 1 (see [Woj87]). Since a BZ/p-null space is BQ-null for any ﬁnite p-group Q (Remark 3.3),
Z is ΣBP-null and hence map∗(BP, Z) is homotopically discrete, therefore map∗(BP, Z)c ≃ ∗
and, from the ﬁbration map∗(BP, Z)c → map(BP, Z)c → Z, we obtain map(BP, Z)c ≃ Z.

Given a morphism ϕ : P → Q in F c, Bϕ is a pointed map and induces a commutative

which shows that the obstructions are in limi
Oc(F ) πiZ, where π∗Z is a constant functor in
Oc(F ). Since Z is p-complete and π1(Z) is abelian, the constant functors πi(Z) all take
values in Z(p) − Mod.

Let F := π∗Z be the constant functor. Fix P in Oc(F )op and consider the atomic functors

and ˜FP(Q) := F(Q)/FP(Q). Filtering F as a series of extensions of functors FP, one for each
object P, and using the long exact sequence for higher limits (see proof of Theorem 1.10 of
[JMO95]), if limi FP = 0 for all P and i > 0, then limi F = 0 for i > 0. By [JMO92, Proposition
6.1 (i),(ii)], if p ∤ | OutF (P)|, then

limiFP =( (π∗Z)OutF (P) = π∗Z , if i = 0,

and if p | | OutF (P)|, then limi FP = 0 for i ≥ 0. Therefore limi
ﬁnally f ≃ ∗.

Oc(F ) πiZ = 0 for i > 0, and

Step 2: We will prove that a map f : BF → BG is null-homotopic if f |BS : BS → BG is
null-homotopic where G is a discrete group.

We will apply Zabrodsky’s lemma [Dwy96, Proposition 3.5] to the map f |BS and the
ﬁbre sequence F → BS → BF where F is connected since π1(Θ) is an epimorphism (Lemma
2.5). Note that map∗(F, BG) is homotopically discrete, then Zabrodsky’s lemma shows that
there is a homotopy equivalence map(BF , BG) ≃ map(BS, BG)[c] where that last mapping
space corresponds to the components which are null-homotopic when restricted to F. The
bijection between components implies that f ≃ ∗.

Finally, we can prove the theorem by looking at the universal cover ˜Z of Z. Let
p : Z → Bπ1(Z). The composite p ◦ f is null-homotopic by Step 2. Therefore there is a
˜f : BF → ˜Z to the universal cover of Z. In order to apply Step 1, we need to check
lift
that ˜f |BS : BS → ˜Z is null-homotopic. Since both Z and Bπ1(Z) are ΣBZ/p-null, applying
mapping spaces from BS to the universal cover ﬁbration shows that map(BS, ˜Z){c} ≃ ˜Z
where {c} is the set of maps which are nullhomotopic when postcomposed with ˜Z → Z.
Note that [ ˜f |BS] ∈ {c}. Since ˜Z is connected, the set {c} only consists on the constant map
and then ˜f |BS is nullhomotopic.

a non-negative integer m ≥ 0 and a map f : |L| → B(Σ|S/K| ≀ Σpm )∧

The homomorphisms ρ|P and cωρ|P equip S/K with a structure of a P-set which are
isomorphic. Hence, to prove the above equality, we only need to show that (S/K, ≤) and
(S/K, ≤ϕ) are equivalent as P-sets.

where Kx = K because K is strongly F -closed and cx : K → S is in F , hence cx(K) = Kx ≤ K
and since cx is an isomorphism, Kx = K.

Next we prove that ϕ−1(ϕ(P) ∩ K) = P ∩ K. On the one hand, ϕ−1(ϕ(P) ∩ K) ≤ P ∩ K
because ϕ−1|ϕ(P)∩K : ϕ(P) ∩ K → S is in F , ϕ(P) ∩ K ≤ K, K is strongly F -closed and
ϕ−1(ϕ(P) ∩ K) ≤ P. The equality will follow if |ϕ−1(ϕ(P) ∩ K)| = |P ∩ K|. Since ϕ is
an isomorphism, it is enough to check |ϕ(P) ∩ K| = |ϕ(P ∩ K)|. We already know that
|ϕ(P) ∩ K| = |ϕ−1(ϕ(P) ∩ K)| ≤ |P ∩ K| = |ϕ(P ∩ K)|. Since ϕ|P∩K : P ∩ K → S is in F , P ∩ K ≤ K
and K is strongly F -closed, ϕ(P∩K) ≤ K but also ϕ(P∩K) ≤ ϕ(P), hence ϕ(P∩K) ≤ ϕ(P)∩K

Question: Given a saturated fusion system (S, F ) and a map f : BF → Z where Z is
a connected ΣBZ/p-null p-complete space. Does f factors, up to homotopy, through
˜f : BF ′ → Z with trivial kernel, where F ′ is a saturated fusion system?

Under some hypothesis we can give a positive answer to the previous question.

10

Proposition 3.8. Let (S, F ) be a saturated fusion system with associated linking system L. Let K
be the kernel of f : BF → Z, where Z is ΣBZ/p-null p-complete space.

If K is normal in F , then there exist a saturated fusion system (S/K, F /K) with associated
linking system L/K and a map pr : |L| → |L/K|, whose homotopy ﬁbre is BK, such that f factors
via ˜f : B(F /K) → Z with trivial kernel.

Proof. In [OV07, Section 2], the authors prove that if K is normal in F , then there is a
saturated fusion system (S/K, F /K) with linking system L/K and a map pr : |L| → |L/K|
whose homotopy ﬁbre is BK.

Since Z is p-complete, one can consider the composite g : |L| → BF → Z such that
g∧
p ≃ f . By assumption Z is ΣBZ/p-null, and also BK is BZ/p-acyclic, then we get a unique
factorization, up to homotopy, ˜g : |L/K| → Z of g by applying Zabrodsky lemma (see
[Dwy96, Proposition 3.4]) to the homotopy ﬁbre sequence BK → |L| → |L/K| and the map

Let [x] ∈ ker( ˜f ) ≤ S/K, then ˜f |Bh[x]i ≃ ∗ implies that f |Bhxi ≃ ∗ and ﬁnally x ∈ K.

Corollary 3.9. Let (S, F ) be a saturated fusion system with associated linking system L. Let K
be the kernel of f : BF → Z, where Z is a connected ΣBZ/p-null p-complete space.

If K is abelian or S is resistant, then there exist a saturated fusion system (S/K, F /K) with
associated linking system L/K and a map pr : |L| → |L/K| whose homotopy ﬁbre is BK and a
homotopy factorization ˜f : BF /K → Z with trivial kernel.

Proof. Recall that K is strongly F -closed by Proposition 3.5. If K is abelian and strongly
F -closed, then it is normal in F by [Cra10, Proposition 3.14]. If S is resistant, each strongly
F -closed subgroup is also normal in F . Finally, apply Proposition 3.8.

4 Homotopy properties of BP-cellular approximations

In this context, it is natural to study homotopy properties of CWBPX which are inherited
by those of X. We will show in this section that CWBP(BF ) is a p-good nilpotent space
whose fundamental group is a ﬁnite p-group.

Proposition 4.1. Let (S, F ) be a saturated fusion system. Then both BF and CWBP(BF ) are
nilpotent. Furthermore, there exists a homotopy ﬁbre sequence

CWBP(BF ) → CWBP(BF )∧

p → (CWBP(BF )∧

p )Q.

Proof. The classifying space BF is p-complete and πi(BF ) are ﬁnite p-groups by Lemma
2.5, hence BF is nilpotent according to [BK72, Proposition VII.4.3(ii)]. Tthen CWBP(BF ) is
also nilpotent [CF15, Corollary 3.2].

Moreover, it follows from [CF15, Lemma 2.8] that R∞CWBP(BF ) ≃ ∗ for R = Q and
R = Fq, q , p, since ˜H∗(BP; R) = 0. Finally, the Sullivan’s arithmetic square applied to the
nilpotent space CWBP(BF ) gives the desired result.

(cid:3)

11

The R-completion functor is a homological localization functor when we restrict to
R-good spaces (see [BK72, p. 205]). By [BK72, Proposition VII.5.1], if the fundamental
group of a pointed space X is ﬁnite, then X is p-good for any prime p. Therefore, in order
to show that CWBP(BF ) is a p-good space, we will prove that its fundamental group is a
ﬁnite p-group.

Proposition 4.2. Let (S, F ) be a saturated fusion system and let P be a ﬁnite p-group. Then
π1CWBP(BF ) is a ﬁnite p-group. Therefore, CWBP(BF ) is a p-good space.

Proof. The proof will be divided in several steps. Let C be the homotopy coﬁbre of the

evaluation map ev : W[BP,BF ]∗ BP → BF .

Step 1: Assume C is simply connected. The Chacholski’s homotopy ﬁbre sequence
CWBP(BF ) → BF → PΣBPC induces a long exact sequence of homotopy groups

. . . → π2(PΣBPC) → π1CWBP(BF ) → π1(BF ) → . . .

where π1(BF ) is a ﬁnite p-group by Lemma 2.5. Therefore, we are reduced to prove that
π2(PΣBPC) is a ﬁnite p-group.

Hurewicz’s theorem shows that H2(PΣBPC; Z) (cid:27) π2(PΣBPC), since PΣBPC is simply
connected ([Bou94, 2.9]). Moreover, since ΣBP is 1-connected, we obtain an epimorphism
H2(C; Z) ։ H2(PΣBPC; Z) by [CGR15, Proposition 3.2]. Then it is enough to prove that
H2(C; Z) is a ﬁnite p-group.

The coﬁbration sequenceW[BP,BF ]∗ BP → BF → C induces a long exact sequence of

homology groups

. . .

/H2(BF ; Z)

f1 /

/H2(C; Z)

f2

/H1(W[BP,BF ]∗ BP; Z)

/. . .

which allows to describe H2(C; Z) by a short exact sequence

0 → ker f2 → H2(C; Z) → Im f2 → 0.

By exactness, ker f2 = Im f1 is a quotient of H2(BF ; Z), where H2(BF ; Z) is a ﬁnite p-group
since H∗(BF ; Z) ֒→ H∗(BS; Z) by [BLO03b, Theorem B]. Hence ker f2 is a ﬁnite p-group.

Now note that

Im f2 ⊂ H1( _[BP,BF ]∗

BP; Z) (cid:27) π1( _[BP,BF ]∗

BP)ab (cid:27) ⊕[BP,BF ]∗Pab,

where [BP, BF ]∗ is a ﬁnite set because there is an epimorphism of sets [BP, BS]∗ ։ [BP, BF ]∗
by [BLO03b, Theorem 4.4], and [BP, BS]∗ (cid:27) Hom(P, S) is ﬁnite. Finally, H2(C; Z) is a ﬁnite
p-group.
Step 2: We will show that there exists a saturated fusion system (S′, F ′) and a BP-

equivalence f : BF ′ → BF such that the homotopy coﬁbre of ev : W[BP,BF ′]∗ BP → BF ′

is 1-connected.

Let N be the normal subgroup of π1BF generated by the image of homomorphisms
P → π1BF such that the induced pointed map BP → Bπ1BF lifts to BF . Let X be the

12

/
/
/
pullback of the universal covergBF → BF → Bπ1BF along BN → Bπ1BF . Then we have

a homotopy commutative diagram

gBF

f

gBF

BF

B(π1BF /N)

BN /

/ Bπ1BF

/ B(π1BF /N)

where the vertical arrows are homotopy ﬁbrations and the horizontal arrows are principal
homotopy ﬁbrations. By Theorem 2.7, there is a satured fusion system (S′, F ′) such that
S′ ≤ S, F ′ ≤ F and X ≃ BF ′. Furthermore, f : BF ′ ≃ X → BF is a BP-equivalence by
Proposition 4.3.

Let C be the homotopy coﬁbre of ev : W[BP,BF ′]∗ BP → BF ′. By Seifert-Van Kampen’s

theorem, C will be 1-connected if π1(ev) : ∗[BP,BF ′]∗ P → π1(BF ′) (cid:27) N is an epimorphism.
Since N is generated by the image of homomorphisms f : P → π1BF such that the
induced map B f : BP → Bπ1BF lifts to ˜f : BP → BF , it is enough to show that for each of
those f , Im( f ) ≤ Im(π1(ev)).

By deﬁnition, there is a factorization f : P → N ≤ π1BF which lifts to BF . There exists

a unique β : BP → BF ′ (up to homotopy) such that the diagram

BP

❋

˜f

❋

"❋

/ Bπ1BF

is homotopy commutative. Therefore Im(π1(β)) = Im( f ) ≤ Im(π1(ev)).

Now we are ready to complete the proof. By Step 2 there exists a saturated fu-
sion system (S′, F ′) and a BP-equivalence f : BF ′ → BF such that the homotopy coﬁ-

bre of ev : W[BP,BF ′]∗ BP → BF ′ is 1-connected. Hence CWBP(BF ) ≃ CWBP(BF ′) and

π1CWBP(BF ) (cid:27) π1CWBP(BF ′) is a ﬁnite p-group by Step 1.

For the proof of Proposition 4.2 we need the next version of a result of N. Castellana,

J.A. Crespo and J. Scherer.

Proposition 4.3 ([CCS07, Proposition 2.1]). Let P be a ﬁnite p-group and let F /
/BG be a
ﬁbration, where G is a discrete group. Let N be the normal subgroup of G generated by the image of
homomorphisms P → G such that the induced pointed map BP → BG lifts to E. Then the pullback
of the ﬁbration along BN → BG

Proof. We want to show that f induces a BP-equivalence. The top ﬁbration in the diagram
yields a ﬁbration

/map∗(BP, B(G/N))c,.

Since the base space is homotopically discrete, we only need to check that all components of
map∗(BP, E) are sent by pr∗ to map∗(BP, B(G/N))c. Thus consider a pointed map h : BP → E.
The composite pr ◦ h is homotopy equivalent to a map induced by a group homomorphism
α = π1(pr ◦ h) : P → G whose image is in N by construction. Therefore pr ◦ h ≃ pr′ ◦ π ◦ h
is null-homotopic.

(cid:3)

Remark 4.4. In the original version the authors consider P = BZ/pm for m > 1 and ¯N to
be the (normal) subgroup generated by all elements g ∈ G of order pi for some i ≤ r such
that the inclusion fg : Bhgi → BG lifts to E, but this subgroup does not have the desired
properties. Consider the ﬁbration BZ/2 ι /
/BZ/2, this ﬁbration has no section and
hence ¯N = {0}. Then E′ ≃ BZ/2 and CWBZ/4(BZ/2) ≃ BZ/2 ; BZ/4 = CWBZ/4(BZ/4),
contradicting the proposition. However, N (cid:27) Z/2 (cid:27) hgi, since fg = pr. Hence E′ ≃ BZ/4
and f : E′ → BZ/4 is an equivalence, in particular it is a BZ/4-equivalence.

5 Cellular properties of the classifying space of a saturated fusion

system

The goal of this section is to prove the main theorem of the paper. Given a ﬁnite p-group P,
this result characterizes the property of being BP-cellular for classifying spaces of saturated
fusion systems in terms of the fusion data.

Theorem 5.1. Let (S, F ) be a saturated fusion system and let P be a ﬁnite p-group. Then BF is
BP-cellular if and only if S = ClF (P).

Corollary 5.2. Let (S, F ) be a saturated fusion system and let P be a ﬁnite p-group.

(a) The classifying space BF is BS-cellular.

(b) Let (S, F ′) be a saturated fusion system with F ⊂ F ′. If BF is BP-cellular then BF ′ is also

BP-cellular.

(c) Let A be a pointed connected space. If ClF ((π1A)ab) = S, then BF is A-cellular.

(d) Let Ωpm(S) be the (normal) subgroup of S generated by its elements of order pi, with i ≤ m. Then
BF is BZ/pm-cellular if and only if S = ClF (Ωpm (S)). In particular, there is a non-negative
integer m0 ≥ 0 such that BF is BZ/pm-cellular for all m ≥ m0.

Proof. (a) Direct from Theorem 5.1 since ClF (S) = S.

14

/
/
/
(b) It follows from the the inclusions ClF (P) ≤ ClF ′(P) ≤ S.

(c) Notice that SP∞A ≃ Qi≥1 K(Hi(A; Z), i) is A-cellular by [DF96, Corollary 4.A.2.1], so

B(π1A)ab ≃ K(H1(A; Z), 1) is also A-cellular from [DF96, 2.D]. Then, BF is B(π1A)ab-
cellular using (a).

(d) We have ClF (Ωpm (S)) (cid:27) ClF (Z/pm). Note that BΩpm(S) is BZ/pm-cellular and that there
exists an m0 ≥ 0 such that S is generated by elements of order a power of p less than
pm0.

(cid:3)

The strategy of proof for Theorem 5.1 goes by analyzing the ﬁbre sequence given in

[Cha96, Theorem 20.5]

CWBP(BF ) c /

/BF r /

/PΣBPC,

where C is the homotopy coﬁbre of the evaluation map ev : W[BP,BF ]∗ BP → BF and r is the

composite BF → C → PΣBPC.

The ﬁrst goal is to compute the kernel of r∧

p . In order to apply the theory of kernels,
developed in Section 3, the target of the map needs to be a connected p-complete ΣBZ/p-
null space.

Since π1BF is a ﬁnite p-group, the same holds for PΣBPC [Bou94, 2.9], therefore
Bousﬁeld-Kan p-completion of the previous homotopy ﬁbration is a homotopy ﬁbre se-
quence ([BK72, II.5.1])

Lemma 5.3. If X is a 1-connected space and P is a ﬁnite p-group, then (PΣBPX)∧

p is ΣBZ/p-null.

Proof. We have the following weak homotopy equivalences

map∗(ΣBZ/p, (PΣBPX)∧

p ) ≃ map∗(BZ/p, Ω(PΣBPX)∧

p ) ≃ map∗(BZ/p, (ΩPΣBPX)∧
p )

where the last equivalence holds by [BK72, V.4.6 (ii)] since X is 1-connected (and so is
PΣBPX by [Bou94, 2.9]).

The commutation rules between nulliﬁcation functors and loops in [DF96, 3.A.1] show
that ΩPΣBPX ≃ PBP(ΩX). Finally, map∗(BZ/p, (PBPΩX)∧
p ) ≃ map∗(BZ/p, (PBPΩX)) ≃ ∗
where the ﬁrst equivalence follows from Miller’s theorem [Mil84, Thm 1.5] and the second
from the fact that BP is BZ/p-acyclic ([Dwy96, Lemma 6.13]).
(cid:3)

Next we describe a criteria for detecting when a map from an A-cellular space is

null-homotopic which will be useful later.

Proposition 5.4. Let X and Y be pointed connected spaces. Assume that X is A-cellular and Y is
ΣA-null. Then a pointed map f : X → Y is null-homotopic if and only if for any map g : A → X
the composite f ◦ g is null-homotopic.

15

/
/
Proof. If f is null-homotopic then for any map g : A → X the composite f ◦ g is null-
homotopic. A

Assume that for any map g : A → X, the composite f ◦ g is null-homotopic. Let C be

the homotopy coﬁbre of ev : W[A,X]∗ A → X. Since f ◦ ev ≃ ∗ by assumption, there is a map

˜f : C → Y such that the following diagram is homotopy commutative

Then f ≃ ∗ if and only if ˜f ≃ ∗.

Since X is A-cellular, PΣAC ≃ ∗. Finally ˜f ≃ ∗ because map∗(C, Y) ≃ map∗(PΣAC, Y) ≃

map∗(∗, Y) ≃ ∗, where the ﬁrst equivalence follows from the fact that Y is ΣA-null.

(cid:3)

A key step in the proof of Theorem 5.1 is the following computation of the kernel of

the map r∧
p .

Proposition 5.5. Let (S, F ) be a saturated fusion system. Then ker(r∧

p ) = ClF (P).

Proof. We will show that ker(r∧
since ker(r∧

p ) ≤ ClF (P) and that f (P) ≤ ker(r∧

p ) for all f : P → S, then

p ) is strongly F -closed, the deﬁnition of ClF (P) implies the equality.

By universal properties of cellularization and p-completion, any map BP → BF lifts to

CWBP(BF )∧

p , then f (P) ≤ ker(r∧

p ) for any homomorphism f : P → S.

According to Proposition 3.7, there exist m ≥ 0 and a pointed map between classifying

p such that ker(k) = ClF (P). Let ι : B ker(r∧

Theorem 4.4]). Then, the map k has the property that for any f : BP → BF , the composite
k ◦ f is nullhomotopic.

(cid:3)

An immediate consequence of Proposition 5.5 is one implication in Theorem 5.1, that
is, if BF is BP-cellular then S = ClF (P). In order to prove the prove the other implication,
we will need a couple of technical results.

Lemma 5.6. Let (S, F ) be a saturated fusion system. If S = ClF (P), then homotopy coﬁbre C of

the evaluation ev : W[BP,BF ]∗ BP → BF is 1-connected.

Proof. From the coﬁbration sequence and Seifert-Van Kampen theorem, we have that
π1C (cid:27) π1BF /N, where N is the minimal normal subgroup of π1BF containing Im(π1(ev)).
Given f : BP → BF , there is group homomorphism g : P → S such that f ≃ Θ ◦ Bg (see
[BLO03b, Theorem 4.4]). Let ¯N be normal subgroup of S generated by all g(P), where
g ∈ Hom(P, S). Then the fundamental group can be described π1(C) (cid:27) S/ ¯NOp

F (S).

F (S) is strongly F -closed by [DGPS11, Proposition A.9]. Morever it contains
g(P) for all g ∈ Hom(P, S). Therefore we have inclusions ClF (P) ≤ ¯NOp
F (S) ≤ S. Since
we are assuming S = ClF (P), the previous inclusions are all equalities and C is then
1-connected.
(cid:3)

First, ¯NOp

Proposition 5.7. Let Z be a ΣiBP-null space where P is a ﬁnite p-group and i ≥ 0. If π1Z is a
ﬁnite p-group then Z∧

PΣBPC is so by [Bou94, 2.9]), consider the p-completed homotopy ﬁbre sequence ([BK72,
II.5.1])

We will show that (PΣBPC)∧

and Proposition 5.5, ker(r∧
there is a splitting CWBP(BF )∧

p is weakly contractible. For this we apply ﬁrst the theory
p (see Lemma 5.3 and Lemma 5.6). By assumption
p is null-homotopic by Theorem 3.6. Then

p ) = S and therefore r∧

p ≃ BF × Ω(PΣBPC)∧
p .

Let X = CWBP(BF )∧

p and Y = Ω(PΣBPC)∧

and that PBP(Y)∧
products, the previous splitting X ≃ BF × Y shows that Y ≃ ∗. Since (PΣBPC)∧
connected, then it follows that it is contractible.

p ≃ ∗
p ≃ Y. Since both nulliﬁcation and p-completion functors commute with
p is 1-

p for simplicity. We will show that PBP(X)∧

p ≃ PBP(CWBP(BF ))∧

First, we have that PBP(X)∧

p ≃ ∗ by checking the hypothesis of
[CF15, Lemma 3.9]. One only needs to check that PBP(X) is p-good and that PBP(X)∧
p is BP-
null. Notice that π1X is a ﬁnite p-group since C is 1-connected by Lemma 5.6. Therefore the
space PBP(X)∧
p is BP-null by Proposition 5.7 and the space PBP(X) is p-good by Proposition
4.2. Finally, recall that BP-cellular spaces are BP-acyclic ([DF96, 3.B.1]).

Now,
PBP(Y)∧

p ≃ PBP(Ω(PΣBPC)∧

p ≃ (ΩPΣBP((PΣBPC)∧

p ≃ (Ω(PΣBPC)∧

p ≃ Ω(PΣBPC)∧

p = Y

where the second equivalence follows from commutation rules [DF96, 3.A.1], the third
holds because (PΣBPC)∧
p is ΣBP-null by Millers’s theorem [Mil84, Thm 1.5], and the forth
is a commutation of taking loops and p-completion [BK72, V.4.6 (ii)].

Summarizing, we have proved that c : CWBP(BF ) → BF is a mod p equivalence.
p ≃ BF

Finally, using Proposition 4.1 we get that c is a weak equivalence since CWBP(BF )∧
and BFQ ≃ ∗.

6 Examples

Let G be a ﬁnite group. The situation when G is generated by elements of order p is well
studied by R. Flores and R. Foote in [FF11]. We start by giving a simple example where G
is not generated by elements of order pi.

Example 6.1. Let G = Σ3, the permutation group of 3 elements. Σ3 is generated by
transpositions, i.e, by elements of order 2, but the Sylow 3-subgroup of Σ3 is S = Z/3.
Therefore, BS is BZ/3r-cellular for all r ≥ 1 and hence (BΣ3)∧
3 is BZ/3r-cellular for all r ≥ 1
by Corollary 5.2.

Notice that BΣ3 is not BZ/3r-cellular for any r ≥ 1: applying map∗(BZ/3r, −) to the
Bi
→ BΣ3 → BZ/2, we see that Bi is a BZ/3r-equivalence for

homotopy ﬁbre sequence BZ/3
any r, since map∗(BZ/3r, BZ/2) ≃ ∗. Then CWBZ/3r(BΣ3) ≃ CWBZ/3r(BZ/3) ≃ BZ/3.

We are now interested in the study of CWBP(BF ) when S , ClF (P). Our aim is to get
p in the p-completed Chacholsky’s ﬁbration describing CWBP(BF ).

Then ˜r is a homotopy equivalence. In particular, CWBP(BF ) ≃ Fp.

Proof. We will proceed as follows: ﬁrst we will construct a map ˜π∧

p ◦ c ◦ f ≃ ∗. There exists ρ ∈ Hom(P, S′) such that

map∗(CWBP(BF )∧

p , ΩBF ′) ≃ map∗(CWBP(BF ), ΩBF ′).

The last mapping space is contractible since ΩBF ′ is BP-null (p:mapping space)
and CWBP(BF ) is BP-acyclic ([DF96, 3.B.1]).

Proof. The connected cover BF ′ is the classifying space of a saturated fusion system over

Corollary 6.5. Let (S, F ) be a fusion system and let P be a ﬁnite p-group. If ClF (P) ⊳ F , then
CWBP(BF ) is homotopy equivalent to the homotopy ﬁbre of BF → B(F /ClF (P)).

Proof. Let K = ClF (P). Since K is normal in F , there is a saturated fusion system (S/K, F /K),
and a map deﬁned between the nerve of the associated linking systems π : |L| → |L/K|
whose homotopy ﬁbre is BK, and an injective factorization of r∧

Example 6.6. Let G be a ﬁnite group and let S be a p-Sylow subgroup of G. Assume that

of Corollary 6.5, for all ﬁnite p-group P, CWBP(BG∧

p ≃ BG∧

An example is given by G = Z/pn ≀ Z/q = (Z/pn)q ⋊ Z/q, when p , q and n ≥ 1.
The Sylow p-subgroup of G is S = (Z/pn)q and ClFS(G)(Z/pr) = (Z/pr)q is abelian and
hence normal in FS(G) by Corollary 3.9. Therefore BG∧
p is BZ/pr-cellular if and only
if r ≥ n by Theorem 5.1. Then CWBZ/pr(BG∧
p ) is equivalent to the homotopy ﬁbre of
BG∧

p → B(G/(Z/pr)q)∧
Other explicit examples appear in [FS07, Example 5.2]. The authors proved that
the normalizer of the Sylow of the Suzuki group Sz(2n), with n an odd integer at least
3, is NSz(2n)(S) = S ⋊ Z/(2n − 1) and it controls fusion in Sz(2n).
In this case, S is
BZ/2m-cellular for all m ≥ 2 and hence BSz(2n)∧

7 The cellularization of the classifying spaces of a family of exotic

fusion systems at p = 3

Let S = B(3, r; 0, γ, 0), for r ≥ 4 and γ = 0, 1, 2, be the family of ﬁnite 3-groups of order 3r
(see [DRV07, Theorem A.2, Proposition A.9]) generated by {s, s1, . . . , sr−1} where

• si = [si−1, s] for all i ∈ {2, . . . , r − 1},

• [s1, si] = 1 for all i ∈ {2, . . . , r − 1},

• s3

i+1si+2 = 1 for all i ∈ {2, . . . , r − 1},

• s3 = 1.

The center of S is hsr−1i. The normal subgroup γ1 = hs1, . . . , sr−1i of S is of index 3 and

the corresponding group extension is split. There are group isomorphisms

B(3, r; 0, γ, 0) = hs1, s2i ⋊ hsi =( (Z/3m × Z/3m) ⋊ Z/3

(Z/3m × Z/3m+1) ⋊ Z/3 , if r = 2m.

, if r = 2m + 1,

In [DRV07, Theorem 5.10], the authors construct families of exotic 3-local ﬁnite groups

F whose Sylow 3-subgroup is S = B(3, r; 0, γ, 0).

Proposition 7.1. Let F be an exotic fusion system over B(3, r; 0, γ, 0) such that F has at least one
F -Alperin rank two elementary abelian 3-subgroup given in [DRV07, Theorem 5.10]. Then

(i) If γ = 0, then BF is BZ/3l-cellular for all l ≥ 1.

(ii) Assume γ , 0. Then BF is BZ/3l-cellular if and only if l ≥ 2. If l = 1, ClF (Z/3) = hs, s2i.

Proof. By Theorem 5.1 we are reduced to the computation of ClF (Z/3l). Let N := hs2, si
which is a proper normal subgroup of S. This subgroup N contains the center of S,
Z(S) = hsr−1i (cid:27) Z/3 by [DRV07, Lemma A.10]. Moreover, the description of F and the
computation of automorphisms of S in [DRV07, Theorem 5.10,Lemma A.14] show that N
is strongly F -closed.

First s ∈ ClF (Z/3l) for all l ≥ 1. If ClF (Z/3l) is a proper normal subgroup of S, again

by [DRV07, Lemma A.10], ClF (Z/3l) = N with [N : S] = 3, and

N (cid:27)( 31+2

+
B(3, r − 1; 0, 0, 0)

, if r = 4,
, if r > 4.

We have then inclusions N ⊂ ClF (Z/3l) ⊂ S. And ClF (Z/3l) = S if and only if there exists
x ∈ S \ N such that x3l

= 1.

Let x = sisj

if γ , 0, ClF (Z/3) = N.

(cid:3)

We will ﬁnish this section by describing CWBZ/3(BF ) when F is an exotic fusion system
over B(3, r; 0, γ, 0) with γ , 0 such that F has at least one F -Alperin rank two elementary
abelian 3-subgroup given in [DRV07].

Lemma 7.2. Let F an exotic fusion system under the hypothesis of Proposition 7.1, BF is
1-connected.
Proof. By Proposition 2.5, the fundamental group of BF is π1(BF ) (cid:27) S/Op
F (S), where
Op
F (S) := h[Q, Op(AutF (Q))] | Q ≤ Si. The subgroup Op
F (S) is a strongly F -closed subgroup
of S, and the arguments in the proof in [DRV07, page 1751] show that it must contain
N = hs, s2i < S. We will show that Op
F (S). Checking tables
in [DRV07, Theorem 5.10,Lemma A.14], we see that the automorphisms of order two η
and/or ω are group elements in AutF (S). By the description given there η(s1) = s1s f ′′
2 and
ω(s1) = s−1
F (S), since
s2, s3

F (S) then s1 ∈ Op

F (S) = S by proving that s1 ∈ Op

(cid:3)

Proposition 7.3. Let F be an exotic fusion system satisfying the hypothesis of Proposition 7.1 with
γ , 0. Let N = hs, s2i < S, then there exists a unique map (up to homotopy) f : BF → (BΣ3)∧
3
whose kernel is N.

Proof. The proof of Proposition 3.7 shows that the quotient morphism S → S/N (cid:27) Z/3
gives a fusion preserving homomorphism ρ : S → Σ3. We want to show that this morphism
extends to a map f : BF → (BΣ3)∧
3 .

By Proposition 2.9, BF ≃ (hocolimOc(F ) ˜BP)∧

3 , where ˜BP ≃ BP for P ∈ F c. The fusion

preserving property of ρ shows that Bρ ∈ limO(F )[BP, (BΣ3)∧
3 ].

The obstructions for rigidifying the homotopy commutative diagram in the category
3 )Θ′◦Bρ|P), for i ≥ 1 (see [Woj87]). Note that since
3 )Θ′◦Bρ|P) is abelian being

of spaces lie in limi+1
the 3-Sylow subgroup of Σ3 is abelian, we have π1(map(BP, (BΣ3)∧
a quocient of CZ/3(ρ(P)). In fact, it will be trivial or Z/3 (Proposition 2.6).

Oc(F ) πi(map(BP, (BΣ3)∧

We will show that for any F : O(F ) → Z(p) − Mod, limi

O(F ) F = 0 for i > 1. From
[BLO03b, Proposition 3.2, Corollary 3.3], we are reduced to show that derived limits of
atomic functors have the same vanishing property. Note that from [DRV07, Theorem

23

5.10,Lemma A.14], the relevant outomorphism groups OutF (P) are SL2(F3) or GL2(F3). In
both cases the 3-Sylow subgrup is of order 3, and then [JMO92, Proposition 6.2(i)] implies
the result.

The obstructions to uniqueness lie in limi

3 )Θ′◦Bρ|P), for i ≥ 1 (see
[Woj87]). By the previous paragrah we have to look at the ﬁrst derived functor of atomic
functors with value Z/3. But since Aut(Z/3) (cid:27) Z/2, by [JMO92, Proposition 6.1(ii)] any
element of order 3 will act trivially on Z/3. Finally note that if a map g : BF → (BΣ3)∧
3 has
kernel N, its restriction g|BS : BS → (BΣ3)∧

Oc(F ) πi(map(BP, (BΣ3)∧

3 has to be homotopic to Bρ.

(cid:3)

Proposition 7.4. Let F be an exotic fusion system over B(3, r; 0, γ, 0) with γ , 0 such that F has
at least one F -Alperin rank two elementary abelian 3-subgroup given in [DRV07, Theorem 5.10].
Then there exists a map f : BF → (BΣ3)∧

p such that CWBZ/3(BF ) is the homotopy ﬁber of f .

Proof. Let f be the map constructed in Proposition 7.3 with ker( f ) = ClF (S). Pre-
cisely because of this,
through the coﬁbre C of ev and, since (BΣ3)∧
f ′ : PΣBZ/3(C) → (BΣ3)∧

f ◦ ev ≃ ∗ where ev : W[BZ/3,BF ]∗ BZ/3 → BF . Then f factors

that there is an element in ω′ ∈ OutF (S) which project to ω ∈ OutΣ3(Z/3) (they are called
