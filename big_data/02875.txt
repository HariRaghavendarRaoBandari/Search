Asymptotic behaviour of the Riemann mapping function

at analytic cusps

Tobias Kaiser and Sabrina Lehner

Abstract. We completely describe the asymptotic behaviour of the Riemann mapping function and its derivatives
at an analytic cusp. We achieve the same for the inverse of the mapping function.

Introduction and results

1.1

Introduction

In the literature, there exists a complete asymptotic description of the mapping function at an
analytic corner (i.e., the boundary at a given boundary point - let’s say the origin - of a given
simply connected and proper domain in the complex plane consists of two regular analytic arcs
with non-zero opening angle). The work of Lichtenstein and Warschawski [4, 7, 9] establishes
the asymptotic behaviour of the mapping function at an analytic corner and of its derivatives.
The mapping function behaves like z1/α, where πα is the opening angle of the analytic corner
(we consider mapping functions onto the upper half plane and assume, applying Carath´eodory’s
theorem on prime ends, that the origin is mapped to the origin). Lehman [3] has then obtained
the stronger result that the mapping function at an analytic corner (and its inverese) can be
developed in a generalized power series. This expansion completely characterizes the asymptotics
of the mapping function. We also refer to Pommerenke [5, Chapter 3].
The latter result was used in [1] to embed the Riemann mapping theorem at analytic corners
into modern real geometry. Hence, from a geometric point of view it is desirable and necessary to
understand the mapping function also at analytic cusps; i.e. if the angle between the two regular
analytic arcs vanishes. But there is a gap in the literature. There are results for arbitrary cusps
(see for example Warschawski [8]), but not suitable ones for the analytic setting (and such are also
not just corollaries from the general ones).
In [2], the ﬁrst author has given the asymptotic behaviour of the mapping function and its inverse
in the special case of so-called analytic cups with small perturbation of angles. Only upper bounds
for the derivatives of these mappings have been established. In the present paper, we are able to
obtain in the general case of arbitrary analytic cusps a nice description of the asymptotic behaviour
of the mapping function, its inverse and the derivatives of these mappings. The quantities used
in the description are geometric invariants of the given analytic cusp. The precise results will be
presented below after a preliminary section, introducing the setting. In the main part of the article,
the results are proven.

1.2 Preliminaries

By N = {1, 2, 3, . . .} we denote the set of natural numbers, by R and C we denote the ﬁeld of real
and complex numbers respectively. We let R∗ := R \ {0} and C∗ := C \ {0} be the set of non-zero
real and complex numbers respectively and R>0 := {x ∈ R : x > 0} be the set of positive real
numbers. Given z ∈ C we denote by Re(z) its real and by Im(z) its imaginary part. Furthermore,
|z| denotes the Euclidean norm of z ∈ C and arg(z) ∈] − π, π] the standard argument of z. By
H := {z ∈ C : Im(z) > 0} we denote the upper half plane in C and by E := {z ∈ C : |z| < 1}
the open unit disc. Given a ∈ C and r ∈ R>0, we set B(a, r) := {z ∈ C : |z − a| < r} and
B(a, r) := {z ∈ C : |z − a| ≤ r}. A domain is a non-empty open and connected subset of C.
Let A ⊂ C be a nonempty set with 0 ∈ A. Let f, g : A → C be functions such that g(z) 6= 0 for all
z in a punctured neighbourhood of 0. We write

f (z)
g(z) = 1,

(a) f ≃ g at 0 on A if limz→0
(b) f ∼ g at 0 on A if limz→0
(c) f = o(g) at 0 on A if limz→0

f (z)

g(z) ∈ C∗,
f (z)
g(z) = 0,

(d) f = O(g) at 0 on A if there is some C > 0 such that |f (z)| ≤ C|g(z)| for all z in a

neighbourhood of 0.

Given a non-vanishing real or complex power series h(t) = P∞

j=0 ajtj, its order is given by
6= 0} and its leading coeﬃcient by lc(h) := aord(h). Moreover,

ord(h) := min{j ∈ N0 : aj
we set ord(0) := ∞.

1.3 Results

Let Ω be a proper and simply connected domain in C. After applying a translation, we assume
that 0 ∈ ∂Ω.
A regular analytic curve in the plane is an analytic mapping γ : I → C such that γ′(t) 6= 0 for all
t ∈ I where I is an interval. A compact trace of a regular analytic curve is called a regular analytic
arc.

1.1 Deﬁnition
We say that Ω has an analytic cusp at 0 if the boundary of Ω at 0 consists of two regular analytic
arcs such that the opening angle of Ω at 0 vanishes.

Assume from now on that Ω has an analytic cusp at 0. We ﬁnd ε > 0 and analytic curves

We perform the following reductions: By shrinking ε > 0 if necessary we obtain after complexi-

γ,eγ :] − ε, ε[→ C with non-vanishing derivatives such that the boundary of Ω at 0 is given by the
regular analytic arcs Γ := γ([0, ε/2]) andeΓ :=eγ([0, ε/2]).
ﬁcation thateγ : B(0, ε) → C is a conformal map onto its image. Applying the inverseeγ−1 we can
assume thateγ is given by the identity and thateΓ is a segment contained in the positive real axis.

2

In this situation, the arc Γ is also tangent to the positive real axis. We write

in polar coordinates. For t suﬃciently close to 0 we have

γ(t) = |γ(t)|exp(cid:16)iarg(cid:0)γ(t)(cid:1)(cid:17)
arg(γ(t)) = arctan  Im(cid:0)γ(t)(cid:1)
Re(cid:0)γ(t)(cid:1)! =: η(t).

is locally invertible at 0 and we can parameterize γ close to 0 by the distance from the origin

Since γ(0) = 0 and γ′(0) ∈ R>0 we have ord(cid:0)Re(γ(t))(cid:1) = 1 and ord(cid:0)Im(γ(t))(cid:1) ≥ 2. Hence,
it follows that |γ(t)| and η(t) are real analytic at 0 and that ord(cid:0)|γ(t)|(cid:1) = 1. Therefore, |γ(t)|
using the parameter s := |γ|−1(t). We obtain γ(s) = sexp(cid:0)iµ(s)(cid:1) where µ(s) is real analytic at 0.
Relabeling γ andeγ, we may assume that µ(s) is positive for small positive s.

This transformation is a geometrical invariant of Ω. From the asymptotic behaviour of the Riemann
mapping function of the transformed domain one can compute the asymptotic behaviour of the
Riemann mapping function of the original domain.

In view of the above reductions we assume from now on the following setup for the rest of the
paper.

General assumption
There is some R > 0 such that

Ω ∩ B(0, R) =nz ∈ C : |z| ≤ R, 0 < arg(z) < ∢Ω(|z|)(cid:9)

where ∢Ω(t) is a real power series that converges on ] − 2R, 2R[ and is positive on ]0, R[.
In this setting, the two boundary arcs of Ω at 0 are given by Γ = γ([0, R]) where γ :] − 2R, 2R[→

C, t 7→ texp(cid:0)i∢Ω(t)(cid:1), andeΓ = [0, R].
The power series ∢Ω(t) is called the angle function of Ω. We call NΩ = N := ord(cid:0)∢Ω(t)(cid:1) the
order of tangency of Ω and aΩ = a := lc(cid:0)∢Ω(t)(cid:1) the coeﬃcient of tangency of Ω.
LetP∞
∞Pj=0

j=NΩ
Ω (t) be the multiplicative inverse of ∢Ω(t). We write this Laurent series in the form
bjtj. For j ∈ {0, . . . , N − 1} we set cΩ,j = cj := πbj/(j − N). Moreo-

j=N ajtj be the power series expansion of ∢Ω(t). Note that a = aN .

1.3 Deﬁnition

The tuple (cΩ,0, . . . , cΩ,N −1, σΩ) ∈ RN +1 is called the asymptotic tuple of Ω.

2.1 Proof of Theorem A

2.1 Lemma
Consider the M¨obius transformation f : H → E1, z 7→ 2z/(z + i), where E1 := {z ∈ C : |z−1| < 1}.

Let ϕ := f ◦ Φ. Then Φ(z) ∼ ϕ(z) and arg(cid:0)Φ(z)(cid:1) = arg(cid:0)ϕ(z)(cid:1) + π
LetP∞

j=1 djzj be the power series expansion of f at 0. Then d1 6= 0. From ϕ(z) =P∞

we see that Φ(z) ∼ ϕ(z). Moreover, we have

j=1 dj(cid:0)Φ(z)(cid:1)j

2 + o(1) at 0 on Ω.

Proof:

arg(cid:0)ϕ(z)(cid:1) = arg(cid:18) 2Φ(z)

Φ(z) + i(cid:19) = arg(cid:0)Φ(z)(cid:1) − arg(cid:0)Φ(z) + i(cid:1).

Since limz→0 arg(cid:0)Φ(z) + i(cid:1) = π

eΦ :eΩ → H, z 7→ Φ(z2). Since ∢ eΩ fulﬁls the condition of Case 1, we obtain the following estimates

Proof of Theorem A:
On Ω we set

N −1Xj=0

Claim 1: We ﬁnd some D ∈ R such that Re(cid:0)H(z)(cid:1) = D + log(cid:0)|Φ(z)|(cid:1) + o(1) at 0.

Proof of Claim 1: Let t := |z|. By Proposition 2.2(1) we ﬁnd some C ∈ R>0 such that

and hence

|Φ(z)| = Cexp (H(|z| + o(1)))

log(cid:0)|Φ(z)|(cid:1) = log(cid:16)C exp(cid:0)H(|z|) + o(1)(cid:1)(cid:17)

= log(C) + log(cid:16)exp(cid:0)H(|z|)(cid:1) + o(1))(cid:17)
= log(C) + log(cid:16)exp(cid:0)H(|z|)(cid:1)(cid:0)1 + o(1)(cid:1)(cid:17)

= log(C) + H(|z|) + o(1).

So it is enough to show that Re(cid:0)H(z)(cid:1) = H(|z|) + o(1). We have that

Re(cid:0)H(z)(cid:1) =

N −1Xj=0

cjtj−N cos(cid:0)(j − N)arg(z)(cid:1) + σ log(t).

By the power series expansion of cosine we see that

cos(cid:0)(j − N)arg(z)(cid:1) = 1 + O(cid:0)arg(z)2(cid:1).

Since ∢Ω(t) = atN + O(tN +1) on Ω we have 0 ≤ arg(z) ≤ atN + O(tN +1) and thus 0 ≤ arg(z)2 ≤
a2t2N + O(t2N +1) for z ∈ Ω close to 0. Using this we obtain

Since aN +1 = . . . = a2N = 0 we obtain bj = 0 for 0 < j ≤ N. By the deﬁnition of the asymptotic

The following example (cf. [2, Remark 8(i)]) does not have small perturbation of angles but can

The function F (z) = exp(cid:0)PN −1

Claim 1: bΦ(z) ∼ F (z) at 0 on bΩ.
Proof of Claim 1: By Theorem A we have Φ(z) ∼ F (z) at 0 on Ω∪ Γ∪eΓ. Since F (z) = F (z) for
z ∈ C \ R≤0 we obtain that bΦ(z) = Φ(z) ∼ F (z) at 0 on Ω′. It remains to show that bΦ(z) ∼ F (z)

Φ(cid:16)γ(cid:16)γ−1(z)(cid:17)(cid:17) ∼ F(cid:16)γ(cid:16)γ−1(z)(cid:17)(cid:17).

H(z) =

Since γ(z) = zexp (i∢Ω(z)) we see by the power series expansion of the exponential function that

(cid:0)γ(z)(cid:1)j−N = zj−N + o(1) for j ∈ {0, . . . , N − 1}. Applying Lemma 2.3, we obtain
cjzj−N + σ log(cid:16)zexp(cid:0)i∢Ω(z)(cid:1)(cid:17)!

F(cid:0)γ(z)(cid:1) ∼ exp N −1Xj=0

∼ exp(cid:0)H(z)(cid:1).
Hence F(cid:0)γ(z)(cid:1) ∼ F (z) at 0 on Ω′′ and thus
F(cid:16)γ(cid:16)γ−1(z)(cid:17)(cid:17) ∼ F(cid:16)γ−1(z)(cid:17).

We also have that γ−1(z) = z + O(zN +1). So similarly to above we get that

Thus, we see that
