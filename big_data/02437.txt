Adsorptionofbrinogenonpositivelychargedmicrosphereswastheoreticallyandexperimentallystudied.The
structure of monolayers and the maximum coverage were determined by applying the experimental measure-
ments at pH = 3.5 and 9.7 for NaCl concentration in the range of 10−3 − 0.15 M. The maximum coverage of
brinogen on latex particles was precisely determined by the AFM method. Unexpectedly, at pH = 3.5, where
both brinogen molecule and the latex particles were positively charged, the maximum coverage varied be-
tween0.9mgm−2 and1.1mgm−2 for10−2 and0.15MNaCl,respectively.Ontheotherhand,atpH = 9.7,the

1. Introduction
Protein adsorption on various surfaces has received a considerable attention due to its importance
in biomedical elds. New biotechnological methods of protein production, purication and separation
dependontheirinterfacialproperties.Furthermore,theproteinadsorptionatsolid/liquidinterfacesen-
abled the development of diverse biomedical applications, such as biosensors, immunological tests, and
drugdeliverysystems.Ontheotherhand,inbiomaterialeld,proteinadsorptionisundesirablebecause
itcancauseadverseresponsessuchasbloodcoagulationandcomplementactivation[1].
Fibrinogen (Fb) is a major serum blood protein that plays an essential role in the clotting cascade
initiated by thrombin. Fibrinogen molecules exhibit a strong tendency to adsorb on various surfaces
underbroadrangeofconditions[2,3]mediatingcellularinteractionsthatareakeyeventindetermining
biocompatibility of these materials [4]. On the other hand, brinogen monolayers adsorbed on various
syntheticmaterialsmaypromoteplateletadhesionthatoftenleadstofoulingofarticialorgans[6,7].
Duetoitsfundamentalsignicance,thechemicalstructureofbrinogenanditsbulkphysicochemical
properties have been extensively studied [8–15]. It was established [9] that the brinogen molecule is a
symmetric dimer composed of three identical pairs of polypeptide chains, referred to as Aα, Bβ and γ
chains [10]. They are coupled in the middle of the molecule through a few disulde bridges forming a
central E nodule. The longest Aα chain is composed of 610 amino acids, the Bβ chain comprises 460
amino-acids and the γ chain 411 amino acids. Accordingly, the molar mass of the brinogen molecule is
equalto338kDa[11].ItisinterestingtomentionthataconsiderablepartoftheAαchainsextendsfrom
thecoreofthemoleculeformingtwopolarappendages(arms)calledthe αCdomains[12].
Information on brinogen’s molecule shape and dimensions was derived from electron [13–16] and
atomic force microscopy (AFM) [17–22]. It was established that the molecule has a co-linear, trinodular
shape with a total length of 47.5 nm [13]. The two equal end domains of rather irregular shape are ap-
proximated by spheres having a diameter of 6.5 nm; and the middle domain has a diameter of 5 nm.

Due to its signicance, the adsorption of brinogen at solid/electrolyte interfaces has been investi-
gated by various experimental methods such as ellipsometry [25], Total Internal Reection (TIRF) [26],
AFM[27],radiolabeling[28],QuartzCrystalMicrobalance(QCM)[29],streamingpotential[23],etc.How-
ever, only in the work of Brash et al. [4] positively charged surfaces were investigated, prepared by con-
trolled adsorption of polycations on a glass substrate. The radiolabeled brinogen was used to monitor
the kinetics of adsorption. It is postulated that three populations of brinogen appear in the adsorbed
monolayers: non- exchanging, slowly, and rapidly exchanging. It was shown that for positively charged
surfaces, the amount of fast and slow exchanging molecules is oppositely different from the neutral and
negativelychargedsurfaces.
Incontrasttothevastliteraturedealingwithotherproteins,onlyafewstudiesfocusedonbrinogen
adsorption on polymeric microspheres have been reported [30, 31]. In reference [32], the effect of ionic
strength in the adsorption of brinogen on polystyrene microspheres (latex) at pH = 7.4 was studied.
The electrophoretic mobility measurements were performed to control the progress of protein adsorp-
tion under in situ conditions. The coverage of the protein was determined by a concentration depletion
method involving AFM imaging of residual brinogen. It was revealed that the maximum coverage of
brinogen on latex varied between 1.9 and 3.2 mg m−2 for 10
−3 and 0.15 M NaCl concentration, respec-
tively. In a recent publication [31], adsorption of brinogen at positively charged amidine microspheres
was studied at pH of 7.4. Quite unexpectedly, the maximum coverage of the protein was much smaller
thanfornegativelychargedlatex,equalto0.6and1.3mgm−2 for 10
−3 and0.15MNaCl,respectively.This
anomalous result was interpreted in terms of the random sequential adsorption model, by postulating a
side-onadsorptionofbrinogenmoleculesatthelatexsurface.
The main goal of this work is to systematically study brinogen adsorption at positively charged mi-
crospheresatpH = 3.5and9.7inordertoquantitativelydeterminethemaximumcoverageasafunction
ofthisparameter.Theseresults,supplementedbyelectrophoreticmobilitymeasurementsfurnishingthe
charge density data, allow one to elucidate brinogen adsorption mechanisms for a broad range of pH
that has a signicance for basic science. This is also of a practical interest for developing a robust pro-
cedure of preparing stable brinogen monolayers at latex particles of a well-controlled coverage and a
known orientation of molecules. Such latex/brinogen complexes can be exploited to study interactions
withotherproteins(antibodies)andlowmolarmassligands.
2. Materialsandmethods
2.1. Experimental
Fibrinogen from human blood plasma, fraction I, type IV used for our study was purchased from
Sigma (F4753) in the form of a powder. The sample contains 65% protein, 15% sodium citrate, and 25%
sodium chloride. The dynamic surface tension method was used to check the purity of brinogen solu-
tion.ThebulkconcentrationofthebrinogeninelectrolytesolutionswasdeterminedbytheBCAmethod
(BicinchoninicacidProteinAssays)[33].
High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) experiments were performed using an Knauer
system.Thecolumnwaspackedwithacompositeofcross-linkedagaroseanddextran.Theowratewas
0.5ml/min.Theabsorptiometricdetectionwasmonitoredat280nm.
The water which was used in all experiments was puried by the Milipore Elix 5 instruments. All
otherreagentswerepurchasedfromSigma–Aldrichandusedwithoutanypurication.

pH of Fb solutions and latex suspension was regulated within the range by the addition of HCl or NaOH.

The dynamic light scattering (DLS) was used to determine diffusion coecients of brinogen and
latexparticles.Ontheotherhand,theelectrophoreticmobilityofbrinogenandbrinogen-coveredmi-
crospheres was measured by the Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) technique. The diffusion coecient

and the elctrophoretic mobility were measured using the Zetasizer Nano ZS Malvern instruments. The

adsorptionofbrinogenonlatexparticles.TheAFMimagingwasusedtodeterminetheaveragenumber
ofbrinogenmoleculesadsorbedoverequalsizedsurfaceareasrandomlyselectedoverthemicasheets.
2.2. Theoreticalmodelling
The modelling of brinogen monolayer formation on microparticle surfaces was carried out by ap-
plyingtherandomsequentialadsorption(RSA)approachdevelopedinreferences[35,36]forquantifying
irreversibleadsorptionproteins(ferritin)onatinterfaces.Inthesecalculations,thespecicinteractions
amongproteinmoleculeswereneglectedandtheirshapewasapproximatedbyacirculardisk.Lateron,
the RSA model was extensively used for calculating the kinetics, the maximum (jamming) coverage and
the monolayer structure of non-spherical particles of various shapes [37–40]. However, all these results
were obtained for hard (non-interacting) particles and at interfaces of innite extension, by neglecting
thecurvatureeffectthatcaninuenceboththestructureandthemaximumcoverageofmonolayers.
The general rules of the Monte-Carlo simulation scheme based on the RSA approach are as
follows[36,38]:
(i) a virtual particle (molecule) is created, whose position within the simulation domain and orienta-
tionareselectedatrandomwithaprobabilitydependingontheinteractionenergy,
(ii) if the particle fullls the pre-dened adsorption criteria it becomes irreversibly deposited and its
positionremainsunchangedduringtheentiresimulationprocess,
(iii) if the deposition criteria are violated, a new adsorption attempt is made, uncorrelated with the
previousattempts.
Usually, two major deposition criteria are dened: (i) there should be no overlapping of any part of
the virtual particle with the previously adsorbed particles and (ii) there should be a physical contact of
theparticlewiththe interface.Despitethesimplicityof thegoverningrules,theRSAmodellingis apow-
erfultoolforecientlyproducingpopulationsofalargenumberofmolecules Np (oftenexceeding 105).
It is also exible because adsorption processes of anisotropic particles at interface of various geometry,
for example on spherical microparticles, can be eciently treated. In this work, adsorption of brino-
gen on microparticle surfaces is simulated by using the bead Model B (see gure 1), previously used for
describing adsorption at at and negatively charged interfaces [23]. In this model, the shape of the b-
rinogenmoleculeisapproximatedbyastringof23co-lineartouchingspheresofvariousdiameters.The
two external spheres have diameters of 6.7 nm and the central sphere has a diameter of 5.3 nm. The
side arms are approximated as straight sequences of 12 beads of equal size, having also the diameter
of 1.5 nm. These side chains form the angle ϕ with the core part of the brinogen molecule. Electric
charges denoted by q1, q2, q3 (see table 1) are attributed to various parts of the brinogen molecule as

In order to calculate the net interaction between the molecules, the pair potentials given by equa-
tion(2.1)wereevaluatedovertheinteractionarea,signicantlyexceedingthedouble-layerthickness(by
excludinginteractionofthebeadsbelongingtothesamebrinogenmolecule).
The model molecules were adsorbed according to the above RSA scheme on a spherically shaped in-
terfacewhoseradiusofcurvatureexactlymatchedthedimensionofthelatexparticlesusedinadsorption
experiments. The electrostatic interactions of the protein with the latex surface were assumed to be of
thesquarewell(perfectsink)type.
Typically, in one simulation run, 1500 molecules were generated. Therefore, in order to improve the
statistics, the averages from ca. 50 independent runs were taken, with the total number of particles ex-
ceeding 70000. This ensures a relative precision of the simulation better that 0.5%. The primary param-
eter derived from these simulations was the average number of molecules adsorbed on latex particles
calculated as a function of time. By extrapolating this dependence to innite time using the procedure

3. Resultsanddiscussion
3.1. Fibrinogenandlatexcharacteristicsinthebulk
As mentioned before, the diffusion coecient of the microspheres was measured by the DLS for
various ionic strengths and pHs. Knowing the diffusion coecient, the hydrodynamic diameter dl [nm]
was calculated using the Stokes-Einstein relationship. In this way, the hydrodynamic diameter of micro-
−3 M, 830± 10 nm, for 10
spheres was determined to be 860± 15 nm, for 10
−2 M, and 815± 10 nm for
0.15M.

Theelectrophoreticmobilityofbrinogenmoleculeswasdeterminedpreviously[31].Thesedataare
also given in table 2. As can be seen, the electrophoretic mobility of brinogen was positive for pH = 3.5
and negative for pH = 7.4 and 9.7. By using the electrophoretic data, one can calculate the electrokinetic

among various parts of brinogen molecule. However, from the diffusion coecient and dynamic vis-
cositymeasurementsreportedinreferences[24]itispredictedthatthepositivechargeisconcentratedin
the end parts of the side arms, which means that q3 remains positive for pH range 3.5–9.7. Accordingly,
q1 and q2 should be negative. However, a precise charge distribution at this pH is not known. This can
onlybeempiricallydeterminedformthethoroughadsorptionexperimentsreportedbelow.
3.2. Fibrinogenadsorptiononmicrospheres
Fibrinogenadsorptiononpolymericmicrosphereswasmonitoredbymeasuringthechangesinelec-
trophoreticmobility(zetapotential)inducedbythisprocess.Thestepsoftheexperimentwereasfollows:
(i) measurement of the zeta potential of bare latex particles whose concentration cl was equal to
60mgL−1,
(ii) adsorption of brinogen on latex particles by lling the cell with the brinogen solution of an
opportuneconcentration cf (0.1–5mgL−1)for600seconds,
(iii) purication of the latex suspension by using a membrane ltration and measurement of the elec-
trophoreticmobilityoflatexusingtheelectrophoreticmethod.
Thisprocedureisreproducibleandallowsonetodeterminethechangesofzetapotentialasafunction

constant where the maximal coverage is approached. Therefore, one can roughly estimate it from the
dependenceof ζf onbrinogencoverageonlatexparticles Γf.Analysinggure2,thelimitingbrinogen
coverages(wherethezetapotentialdoesnotchange)areapproximately0.9and1.1mgm−2 forNaClcon-

Theseresultsindicatethatsignicantadsorptionofbrinogenonlatexparticlesoccurredfortheapplied

It should be mentioned, however, that the maximum coverages of brinogen derived from the zeta
potential measurements are of a limited precision. Therefore, in order to more exactly determine the
maximumcoverage,aquantitativedepletionmethoddescribedinreference[30]wasapplied.According
to this procedure, the residual brinogen remaining in the suspension after the adsorption step is ad-

By extrapolating the linear experimental dependencies shown in gures 4 and 5 to zero, one can
obtain the threshold brinogen concentrations denoted by cfmax. Knowing the concentrations, the max-
imum coverage of brinogen on latex can be calculated directly from equation (3.4) by substituting cf
by cfmax In this way, one obtains precise values of Γmax that are listed in table 3. As can be noticed, the
maximum coverages agree with the previous results derived from the zeta potential measurements (see
gures 2–3). Thus, for pH = 3.5, the maximum coverage is negligible for NaCl concentrations equal to
−3 M.However,forhigherNaClconcentrationsof 10
−2 and0.15M,themaximumbrinogencoverage
assumes quite appreciable values of 0.9 and 1.1 mg m−2, respectively. The latter results prove that the
classical mean-eld approach, where it is assumed that the effective charge on protein molecules is uni-
formlydistributedandthemoleculeischaracterizedbyanaveragevalueofzetapotential,isinadequate.
Thisisso,becauseboththelatexparticlesandbrinogenmoleculeexhibitalarge(positive)zetapotential
at pH = 3.5 for NaCl concentration of 10
−2 and 0.15 M (see table 2). This discrepancy can be explained
in terms of a heterogeneous charge distribution over the brinogen molecule with a negative charge lo-
cated in its core part whereas the rest of the molecule remains positively charged. This assumption is
supportedbythefactthatthecorepartofthebrinogenmoleculecomprisesasparticandglutamicacids

Therefore, our experimental studies show that even at pH = 3.5, the brinogen molecule contains
negatively charged fragments which is in conict with the previous reports where it was assumed that
theentiremoleculeispositivelychargedatthispH[24,34,42].
Thepresenceofanegativechargeatthecorepartofthemoleculesuggeststhatbrinogenadsorption
atpH = 3.5occursexclusivelyintheside-onorientationwiththe αCdomainsoftheAαchainspointingto-
wardthebulksolution.Thisassumptionissupportedbythefactthatthetheoreticallypredictedcoverage
derived by applying the random sequential adsorption modelling [30] is equal to 1.13 and 1.22 mg m−2
for NaCl concentration of 10
−2 and 0.15 M, which is slightly lower than with experimental values. Snap-
shots of brinogen monolayers on latex particles derived from these simulations are shown in gure 6

Ascanbeseen,itistheoreticallypredictedthatbrinogenmoleculesadsorbintheside-onorientation
exposing the positively charged side arms into the electrolyte solution. Additionally, due to the lateral
electrostatic repulsion among the beads forming the core part of molecules, the monolayer obtained for
10−2 M, NaCl is characterized by a signicantly smaller density compared to the jamming coverage for
hard(non-interacting)spherespredictedtobe1.29mg −2 [24].
For pH = 7.4, the experimental maximum coverages are 1.2 and 1.3 mg m−2 that are only slightly
largerthanatpH = 3.5butconsiderablylowerthanforbrinogenadsorptionatnegativelychargedlatex

7.4, the net charge of the brinogen molecule is strongly negative (see table 2). In the case of positively
charged microspheres, this discrepancy can be explained by the appearance of a strong electrostatic
attractionbetweentheparticlesurfaceandbrinogenmoleculespromotingtheirside-onorientation.
However,atpH = 9.7,wherethebrinogenmoleculechargeisconsiderablymorenegative,themax-
imum coverages signicantly increase attaining 2.0, 2.3 and 3.4 mg m−2 for NaCl concentration of 10
−3,
−2 and 0.15 M, respectively. As can be noticed, (see table 3), these results are similar to the previously
reportedforthebrinogenadsorptionatnegativelychargedlatexatpH = 3.5[30].Theywereinterpreted
in terms of the RSA model assuming unoriented adsorption of brinogen, i.e., simultaneously occurring
in the side-on and end-on orientations that prevails for long adsorption times. Additionally, in these cal-
culationsthe lateralelectrostatic repulsionamongthe adsorbedbrinogenmolecules wasconsidered to

umnintable3).Therefore,theagreementofourresultsobtainedforpositivelatexwiththesetheoretical

orientation.

4. Conclusions
TheAFMandmicro-electrophoreticmeasurementscomplementedbyextensiveRSAmodellingdeliv-
ered reliable information about the mechanisms of brinogen adsorption on positively charged micro-
spheres for a broad range of pHs and ionic strength. It was conrmed that brinogen adsorption was
irreversibleandthemonolayerpropertieswerestableintime.
−2 and 0.15 M, the
maximumbrinogencoverageofbrinogenonmicrosphereswasquitesignicantamountingto0.9and
1.1mgm−2,respectively.Thiscontradictsthepredictionsderivedfromtheclassicalmean-eldapproach
because both the brinogen molecules and the latex particles exhibit a positive zeta potential at this
pH.Thisdiscrepancywasexplainedintermsofaheterogeneouschargedistributionoverthebrinogen
molecule with a negative charge located at its core part whereas the rest of the molecule remains posi-
tively charged. This anomalous adsorption of brinogen conrms that, in contrast to common views, a
negative charge is present at the body of the brinogen molecule even at such low pH. This enables a
side-onadsorptionofthemoleculesinterpretedbytherandomsequentialadsorptionmodelling.
The increase in the brinogen coverage with NaCl concentration was interpreted as due to the elec-
trostaticrepulsionamongtheadsorbedproteinmolecules.Ontheotherhand,forpH = 9.7,themaximum
coverage of brinogen on latex was much larger, varying between 2.0 mg m−2 and 3.4 mg m−2 for 10
−3
and0.15MNaCl,respectively,whichalmostfullymatchesthepreviousresultsobtainedfornegativelatex
at pH = 3.5. These results were in agreement with the theoretical RSA modelling carried out by assum-
ingtheside-onandend-onorientationsprevailingatlongertimes.Thisconrmedadifferentadsorption
mechanism of brinogen on latex at pH = 9.7, characterized by the presence of a considerable amount
of end-on adsorbed molecules. The increase in the coverage with NaCl concentration was interpreted in
termsofthediminishingrangeoftherepulsiveelectrostaticinteractionsamongtheadsorbedmolecules.
