LIFTABILITY OF SINGULARITIES AND THEIR FROBENIUS MORPHISM

MODULO p2

MACIEJ ZDANOWICZ

Abstract. We investigate the W2(k)-liftability of singular schemes. We prove constructibility
of the locus of W2(k)-liftable schemes in a ﬂat family X → S. Moreover, we construct an explicit
W2(k)-lifting of a Frobenius split scheme X over a perfect ﬁeld k, reproving Bhatt’s existential
result. Furthermore, we study existence of liftings of the Frobenius morphism. In particular, we
prove that in dimension n ≥ 4 ordinary double points do not admit a W2(k)-lifting compatible
with Frobenius, and that canonical surface singularities are Frobenius liftable. Combined with
Bhatt’s results, the latter result implies that the crystalline cohomology groups over k of surfaces
with canonical singularities are not ﬁnite dimensional. As a corollary of our results, we provide a
thorough comparison between the notions of W2(k)-liftability, Frobenius liftability and classical
F -singularity types.

1. Introduction

In the seminal paper [DI87], Deligne and Illusie observed that a smooth variety X deﬁned
over a perfect ﬁeld k of characteristic p possesses many desired properties, which are standard in
characteristic 0, provided it admits a ﬂat lifting to W2(k), i.e., a unique Z /p2-ﬂat extension of
k. This observation turned out to be very fruitful and leads to many further results overcoming
pathological behaviour of positive characteristic geometry of smooth varieties (see, e.g., [OV07,
Lan15]). The crucial part of the arguments given in the papers mentioned was the existence of a
local lifting of the Frobenius morphism mod p2.

In this paper, we investigate the existence of W2(k) and Frobenius liftings in the more general
setting of singular schemes. In this situation, contrary to the case of smooth schemes, a W2(k)-
lifting need not to exist even aﬃne locally. The simplest instance of that phenomenon, in fact
0-dimensional, was given without a proof in [Bha12, Remark 3.16]. We present a detailed analysis
of a slightly more general example in Section 3.2.

Furthermore, in [Bha14] the author generalizes the results of [DI87] under the assumption of
global Frobenius liftability (see Deﬁnition 1.1), and consequently proves that the crystalline coho-
mology over k of Frobenius liftable locally complete intersection schemes is not ﬁnitely generated.

The aforementioned examples and results suggest the following two basic question:

Question 1: What are the necessary conditions for a scheme to possess a W2(k)-lifting?
Question 2: For a given scheme, does there exist a W2(k)-lifting together with a compatible

lifting of the Frobenius morphism?

General answers to the questions were given in [Ill72, MS87, Jos07a] and stated that above
problems can be expressed in purely cohomological manner. Moreover, in [LS14] the authors
investigated the ﬁrst question in the setting of birational geometry. Our contribution to answering
the above questions is the following.

As far as the ﬁrst question is concerned, in Section 3.3 we analyse how the property of W2(k)-
liftability behaves in families f : X → S. More precisely, we show, that under mild assumptions
suitable for deformation-theoretic considerations (satisﬁed if e.g. f is proper or aﬃne), the locus
= f −1(s) is constructible (see Theorem 3.11). Furthermore, we
of Witt vector liftable ﬁbres Xs
reprove the result that Frobenius split schemes are W2(k)-liftable. The advantage of our approach is
that we provide the lifting explicitly and functorially with respect to a splitting ϕ : FX∗OX → OX ,
in fact as a certain subscheme of the Witt scheme (X, W2(OX )). The details of our construction
are presented in Section 3.4.

Moreover, we give a new construction of a non-liftable aﬃne scheme. In fact, the construction
is given by a cone over a suitable embedding on a non-liftable projective scheme (for the proof see
Lemma A.21 in the Appendix A). Examples of non-liftable projective schemes are given, e.g., by
Raynaud [Ray78] and Mukai [Muk13].

Concerning the second question, we derive a computationally feasible criterion for Frobenius
liftability of complete intersection aﬃne schemes (see Theorem 4.6). Consequently, we apply the
criterion in the case of ordinary double points (see Theorem 4.10), and thus answer the question
asked by Bhatt in [Bha14, Remark 3.14]. As another application of our criterion, in Section 4.4 we
prove that canonical surface singularities are Frobenius liftable. Finally, in Section 4.4.2 we present
a general approach for proving Frobenius liftability of tame reductions of quotient singularities.
The method is based on the spreading out technique combined with functoriality of obstruction
classes for lifting morphisms.

The above results allow us to address the following question:

Question 3: What is the relation between W2(k)-liftability and Frobenius liftability, and

classical notions deﬁned in terms of Frobenius action?

Our contribution can be summarized by the following diagram which describes all potential

relations between the classical F -singularities and the notion considered in this paper:

The counterexamples corresponding to most of the strikethrough implications in the diagram

are provided in Section 5

As a byproduct of our considerations, we formalise the foregoing functoriality properties of
obstruction classes for deformation of schemes and their morphism. In particular, we analyse their
behaviour in the case of aﬃne schemes. The results are given in Appendix A. Apart from explicit
statements and proofs concerning functoriality, the whole theory can be found in the standard
reference [Ill72].

In the course of our consideration we faced the following problem:

Open question: Does there exist a ﬁnite ´etale covering π : Y → X of schemes locally of

ﬁnite type over k such that Y is W2(k)-liftable and X is not.

Note that by Lemma 3.1 the degree of π would necessarily be divisible by p and by Lemma A.11
the schemes need not be aﬃne.

1.1. Notation and basic deﬁnitions. Here we present a few general assumptions on schemes
and their morphisms. Moreover, we give basic deﬁnitions concerning Frobenius morphism and
Witt vector liftability.

1.1.1. Generalities on schemes and morphisms. Throughout the following work k is a perfect ﬁeld
of characteristic p > 0. All rings we consider are commutative, noetherian and with identity. Unless
otherwise stated the schemes and morphisms between them are quasi-compact, quasi-separated
and essentially of ﬁnite type over k (in particular, the schemes are noetherian). For any morphism
f : X → Y , the associated mapping of sheaves of rings is denoted by f # : OY → f∗OX . For any
k-scheme X by FX : X → X we mean the absolute Frobenius morphism, i.e., the identity on the
level of topological spaces and F #
X (f ) = f p. Moreover, for any
morphism f : X → S by

eX ×eS S ≃ X.
We say that X/S admits an eS-lifting or is eS-liftable if there exists a lifting eX/eS as described
eX/W2(k). Moreover, we say that it lifts compatibly with Frobenius or is Frobenius liftable (abbr.
F -liftable) if there exists a lifting eX of X together with a morphism eF : eX → eX over the Frobenius

of W2(k) which restricts to FX : X → X, i.e., such that the following diagram is commutative:

In particular, we say that X/k lifts to W2(k) or is W2(k)-liftable if it admits a lifting

the derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a scheme X. We add + (respectively −) in
the superscript in order to indicate that we consider the category of bounded below (respectively
above) complexes. Moreover, by D−

of complexes whose cohomology sheaves are coherent. Again, based on our assumptions, one can
prove that any object in D−

Coh(X) we denote the full subcategory of D−

Coh(X) is quasi-isomorphic to a complex of coherent sheaves.

1.2. Structure of the paper. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give a few
preliminary results concerning commutative algebra and homological algebra.

In Section 3 we investigate W2(k)-liftability of schemes.

In particular, we prove that under
suitable assumptions Witt vector liftability is a constructible property (see Theorem 3.11) and
give a construction of a W2(k)-lifting of a Frobenius split scheme (see Theorem 3.16).

In Section 4 we address the problem of Frobenius liftability of singularities. We derive a compu-
tational criterion for Frobenius liftability of complete intersection schemes (see Theorem 4.6) and
consequently apply it to ordinary double points (see Theorem 4.10) and canonical surface singular-
ities (see Theorem 4.12). Section 5 is devoted to comparing W2(k)-liftability and F -liftability with
classical notions of F -regularity, F -rationality and F -purity. In Section 6 we recall the classical
approach to deformation of cones with an emphasis on W2(k)-liftability. Moreover, we extend the
standard results with a study of Frobenius liftability.

Due to their technical nature deformation theory considerations are deferred to Appendix A.
We recall a few results concerning deformation functors and present a thorough description of
functoriality of obstruction classes expressed in terms of cotangent complex. Moreover, we present
a handful of remarks concerning deformations of aﬃne schemes.

2. Preliminaries

2.1. Basic commutative algebra, ﬂatness criteria. We recall basic facts concerning ﬂatness
of W2(k)-modules and algebras. Under standard bijection W2(k) ≃ k2 the element p ∈ W2(k)
corresponds to (0, 1) ∈ k2.
Lemma 2.1. A W2(k)-module M is ﬂat if and only if the annihilator AnnM (p) = {m ∈ M :
pm = 0} of p in M is equal to pM , i.e., the natural mapping M/pM → pM given by [m] 7→ pm
is injective.

Proof. We ﬁrstly prove that pW2(k) ⊗W2(k) M is isomorphic to M/pM . This follows from right
exactness of the functor − ⊗ M and a resolution of pW2(k):
/ pW2(k)

/ W2(k)

W2(k)

/ 0.

p·

p·

By a well-known criterion stating that M is ﬂat over W2(k) if and only if − ⊗W2(k) M preserves
any injection of ideal of W2(k) (see [AM69], Exercise 2.24), the ﬂatness of M is now equivalent to
the injectivity of the multiplication by p mapping pW2(k) ⊗W2(k) M → M . By the isomorphism
above, this mapping is the same as mp : M/pM → M given by [m] 7→ pm. The kernel of mp is
exactly AnnM (p)/pM ⊂ M/pM and therefore injectivity is equivalent to the hypothesis of the
lemma.

(cid:3)

As a simple corollary we obtain:

Corollary 2.2. A ring B/W2(k) is a ﬂat lifting of A/k if and only if B/pB ≃ A and pB =
AnnB(p). Moreover, for any ﬂat lifting B/W2(k) of A the quotient B/J is a ﬂat lifting of A/I if
and only if J is a lifting of I and (p) ∩ J = pJ.
Proof. The ﬁrst part follows directly from Lemma 2.1. To prove the second part, we apply the
following sequence of equivalences:

(1)

AnnB/J p = p · B/J ⇔ (J : (p)) = (J + p) ⇔ p(J : (p)) = p(J + p) ⇔ (p) ∩ (J) = pJ,

where the middle one follows from the inclusions (J : (p)) ⊃ (p) ⊂ (J + p) and the injectivity of
the mapping B/p → pB.
Lemma 2.3. Suppose B/W2(k) is a ﬂat lifting of B/p. Then, any lift f ∈ B of a non-zerodivisor
f ∈ B/pB is a non-zerodivisor. Moreover, B/f B is a W2(k)-lifting of B/(p, f )B.
Proof. Assume that g ∈ B satisﬁes the equality gf = 0. By reducing mod p we see that g · f =
0 and therefore g = ph for some h ∈ B. Again, using the assumption and the isomorphism
B/pB ≃ pB (see Lemma 2.1), we see that h · f = 0 and consequently h = ph′. This implies
that g = p2h′ = 0 yielding the ﬁrst part of the lemma. For the second part, we consider the ﬂat
resolution of B/f B given by 0 −→ B −→ B −→ B/f B −→ 0. By reducing mod p we see that
TorW2(k)
(B/f B, k) = 0 and therefore B/f B is W2(k)-ﬂat (see [Sta15, Tag 051C]). Alternatively,
we can prove that (f ) ∩ (p) = (pf ) and use the above Corollary 2.2.

Lemma 2.4. Let I = (f1, . . . , fm) be an ideal in k[x1, . . . , xn]. Every W2(k)-lifting of k[x1, . . . , xn]/I
is given by W2(k)[x1, . . . , xn]/J, where J is generated a sequence of lifts of {fi}. Conversely, if
(f1, . . . , fm) is a regular sequence then for every ideal J generated by the sequence of lifts of {fi}
the ring W2(k)[x1, . . . , xn]/J is a W2(k)-lifting.

Proof. For the ﬁrst part see [Har09, Theorem 10.1]. For the converse, apply the above Lemma 2.3,
inductively.
(cid:3)

2.2. Base change for higher direct images. We now present a few results concerning derived
inverse images and base change for unbounded complexes.
Deﬁnition 2.5 (Morphism of ﬁnite Tor dimension). We say that a morphism of schemes f : X →
Y is of ﬁnite Tor dimension if OX is a f −1OY -module of ﬁnite Tor dimension.

For any morphism f : X → Y of ﬁnite Tor dimension the structural sheaf OX is in fact

quasi-isomorphic to a bounded complex of ﬂat f −1OY -modules (see [Sta15, Tag 08CI]).
Remark 2.6. In the case of morphisms of quasi-projective schemes over a ﬁeld by [FM81, II.1.2]
we know that the following morphisms are of ﬁnite Tor dimension:
a) morphism with a smooth target,
b) ﬂat morphisms,
c) regular and Koszul closed immersions.

Due to the lack of an adequate reference, we give a detailed proof of the following lemma.

Lemma 2.7 (Spectral sequence for derived pullback). Suppose f : X → Y is a morphism of ﬁnite
Tor dimension. Then, for any F • ∈ D(OX ) there exists a spectral sequence:

Epq
2 = Lpf ∗ (Hq(F •)) ⇒ Lp+qf ∗F •.

Proof. This is an application of the spectral sequence of a double complex. Indeed, by [Sta15,
Tag 08DE] we see that the total derived pullback Lf ∗F • is given by the totalisation of the double
complex f −1F • ⊗f −1OY E • where E • is a bounded f −1OY -ﬂat resolution of OX existing by the
assumption on f . By the classical result there exist a spectral sequence:

Epq
2 = HpHq(f −1F • ⊗f −1OY E •) ⇒ Hp+qTot(f −1F • ⊗f −1OY E •),

whose convergence follows from the fact that f −1F • ⊗f −1OY E • is a double complex supported in
the bounded horizontal strip {(i, j) : j ∈ {k : E k 6= 0}}. The sheaves Hp+qTot(f −1F • ⊗f −1OY E •)
are easily identiﬁed with Lp+qf ∗F •. Moreover, by the exactness of the functor f −1 and ﬂatness
of E • (in fact, we use [Sta15, Tag 08DE] again), we see that

HpHq(f −1F • ⊗f −1OY E •) ≃ Hp(f −1Hq(F •) ⊗f −1OY E •) ≃ Lpf ∗Hq(F •).

This gives the desired result.
Lemma 2.8. Let f : X → S be a locally of ﬁnite type morphism of schemes, and E a complex in
DQCoh(X). Then for every cartesian diagram:

Lemma 2.9. Suppose f : X → Y is a morphism of schemes. Then, for every F • ∈ D−
there exists a natural isomorphism Lf ∗RHom(F •,OY ) ≃ RHom(Lf ∗F •,OX ).
Proof. By [Sta15, Tag 08I3] we obtain a mapping:

fE is an isomorphism.

Coh(Y )

Lf ∗RHom(F •,OY ) → RHom(Lf ∗F •,OX ).

In order to prove that it is an isomorphism we can work locally and therefore we may assume
that LX/S is resolved as a complex of locally free sheaves. In this case, the result follows from the

deﬁnition of Lf ∗ and the fact that RHom(−,OX) might be computed by a locally free resolution

2.3. A primer in deformation theory. Due to unoriginal and tediously technical nature of the
considerations given in the corresponding section we defer it to Appendix A. The reader familiar
with 1) obstruction theories deﬁned in terms of cotangent complex, 2) the notion of deformation
functor and its basic properties, may comfortably proceed with the actual content of the paper.
In the upcoming considerations we freely use the above notions by referring to Appendix A.1 and
Appendix A.3, respectively.

3. W2(k)-liftability

In this section we begin the main considerations of this work. Firstly, we present general facts
concerning W2(k)-liftability and give a few examples. Subsequently, we prove that the locus of
W2(k)-liftable schemes in a ﬂat family X → S is constructible. Finally, we reprove constructively
the classical result (see Proposition 3.2) that any Frobenius-split variety admits a W2(k)-lifting.
We begin with functoriality of obstructions to existence of W2(k)-liftings.

3.1. General results on obstruction to liftability.
Lemma 3.1. For any scheme X/k there exists an obstruction σX ∈ Ext2(LX/k,OX ) whose van-
ishing is suﬃcient and necessary for existence of W2(k)-lifting. The obstruction is functorial, i.e.,
for any k-scheme morphism g : X → Y the following diagrams in DQCoh(X) and DQCoh(Y ) are
commutative:

Lg∗LY /k

Lg∗σY/

dg

LX/k

Lg∗OY [2]

≃

σX

/ OX [2],

σY

LY /k

dg

OY [2]

g#[2]

Rg∗LX/k

Rg∗σX/

/ Rg∗OX [2].

In particular W2(k)-liftability descends along ﬁnite surjective maps of degree prime to the charac-
teristic of k.

Proof. This is a direct consequence of Lemma A.6. The ﬁnal remark follows from existence of the
trace maps splitting g#.
(cid:3)

As corollary we obtain a well-known result that every Frobenius split variety lifts.

Proposition 3.2. If X/k is a Frobenius split scheme then X (1)/k lifts to W2(k).

Proof. See [Ill96, p. 164] or [Jos07b, Corollary 9.2] for the case of smooth schemes. We reproduce
general proof by Bhargav Bhatt given in [Lan15, Proposition 8.4]. The idea is to use the functo-
riality of obstructions for the relative Frobenius FX/k : X → X (1). Namely, we have the following
commutative diagram:

L

X (1)/k

dFX/k

σ

X(1)

OX (1) [2]

FX/k∗LX/k

FX/k∗σX

/ FX/k∗OX [2].

The diﬀerential dFX/k = 0 and therefore by existence of splitting σX (1) = 0. Note that in case of
varieties over a perfect ﬁeld the W2(k)-liftability of X (1) is in fact equivalent to the liftability of
X.
(cid:3)

3.2. Example of non W2(k)-liftable scheme, p-neighbourhoods of smooth quadrics. We
proceed to an example of 0-dimensional scheme which is not W2(k)-liftable. In this case we give
a direct computational proof which is afterwards used in the considerations concerning Frobenius
liftability of ordinary double points. We shall prove that the Artinian local k-algebras:

(A2n, m2n) =(cid:0)k[x1, . . . , x2n](cid:14)(x1x2 + . . . + x2n−1x2n, xp

ideals do not admit PD-structure.

3.2.1. Non-liftability to W2(k).

Proposition 3.3. For any N ≥ 5 the local algebra AN does not admit a W2(k)-lifting.

The proof for odd number N = 2n + 1 ≥ 7 of variables is analogously reduced to the case of
6 variables by additional specialisation x2n+1 = 0. The case N = 5 can be treated easily by an
explicit computation following the lines of the above.

Remark 3.4. We have implemented Macaulay2 procedure checking whether a give aﬃne scheme
is W2(k)-liftable. The code is given at .

3.2.2. Non-existence of a PD-structure on (A, m). We now prove that the ideal m does not admit
PD-structure in spite of satisfying the necessary condition m[p] = 0. We precede the actual result
with a necessary deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 3.5 (PD-structure). Let A be a commutative ring and let I be an ideal of A. A divided
power structure is a collection of mappings γi : I → A for i ∈ N satisfying the following properties:
i) γ0(x) = 1, γ1(x) = x for any x ∈ I and γn(x) ∈ I for any n ≥ 1,
ii) γn(x)γm(x) = (n+m)!

n!m! γn+m(x),

iv) γn(ax) = anγn(x) for any x ∈ I and a ∈ A,
v) γn(x + y) =Pi+j=n γi(x)γj (y).

The above notion is a necessary tool for dealing with de Rham and crystalline cohomology in

characteristic p.

Using ii) we see that p!γp(x) = xp, which indeed implies that any ideal I of an Fp-algebra A

admitting a PD-structure satisﬁes the condition I [p] = 0.
Proposition 3.6. For N ≥ 5 the local algebras (AN , mN ) deﬁned above do not admit PD-
structures on the maximal ideals mN .

Proof. We focus on the case of even N = 2n. For the sake of contradiction, we assume an
appropriate system of mappings γi exists and analyse the element γp(f2n) = γp(0) = 0.

3.3. W2(k)-liftability in families. We now proceed to the proof that under suitable conditions
Witt vector liftability is a constructible property, i.e., for a locally ﬁnite type family f : X → S
the set of closed points s ∈ S such that the ﬁbre Xs is W2(k(s))-liftable is constructible. We begin
with a deﬁnition encompassing the properties of a morphism necessary to prove constructibility.
Deﬁnition 3.7. We say that a morphism f : X → S is strongly equicohomological if it is locally of
ﬁnite type and ﬂat, and for any i ∈ {0, . . . , dim S+2} the higher direct image Rif∗RHom(LX/S,OX )
is a ﬂat OS-module.

Strongly equicohomological families satisfy the following crucial property motivated by the

application for deformation theory.
Lemma 3.8. Let f : X → S be a strongly equicohomological morphism with a smooth target S.
For any morphism T → S the sheaf R2f∗RHom(LX/S,OX ) satisﬁes base change property, i.e.,
for any cartesian diagram:

j

there exists a natural isomorphism i∗R2f∗RHom(LX/S,OX ) ≃ R2fT ∗RHom(LXT /T ,OXT ).
Proof. By Lemma 2.8 there exists a natural quasi-isomorphism:

(2)

Li∗Rf∗RHom(LX/S,OX ) → RfT ∗Lj∗RHom(LX/S,OX ).

By Lemma 2.9 and the base change property of cotangent complex we obtain an isomorphism:

Lj∗RHom(LX/S,OX ) ≃ RHom(Lj∗LX/S, Lj∗OX ) ≃ RHom(LXT /T ,OXT ),

which implies that the right hand side of (2) is isomorphic to RfT ∗RHom(LXT /T ,OXT ). By
taking cohomology, for any k ∈ Z we obtain an isomorphism:

Lki∗Rf∗RHom(LX/S,OX ) → RkfT ∗RHom(LXT /T ,OXT ).

By Lemma 2.7 there exists a convergent spectral sequence:

Epq
2 = Lpi∗Hq(Rf∗RHom(LX/S,OX )) ⇒ Lp+qi∗Rf∗RHom(LX/S,OX ).

The terms on E2 page are isomorphic to Lpi∗Rqf∗RHom(LX/S,OX )) and therefore by the as-
sumption on being strongly equicohomological Epq
2 = 0 for (p, q) ∈ Z<0 ×{0, . . . , dim S + 2} and

p > 0. Moreover, by the smoothness of S we see that Epq
2 = 0 for p < − dim S and con-
for any p ∈ Z and r ≥ 2. This means that the natural ﬁltra-
sequently E−p,p+2
tion induced on L2i∗Rf∗RHom(LX/S,OX ) by the spectral sequence consists of a single term
i∗R2f∗RHom(LX/S,OX ). This ﬁnishes the proof.

As a corollary we obtain:

Lemma 3.9. Let f : X → S be a strongly equicohomological morphism with a smooth aﬃne target.
Then, the set of closed points s ∈ S such that Xs is W2(k(s))-liftable is closed.

Proof. By the assumptions on S we see that there exists a W2(k)-lifting eS of S. Therefore, there
is a relative obstruction class σf ∈ Ext2(LX/S, f ∗(pOeS)) = Ext2(LX/S ,OX ) which vanishes if and
only if there exists a ﬂat eS-scheme eX ﬁtting into the cartesian diagram:

/ Spec(W2(k)).

By the formal smoothness of eS → Spec(W2(k)), any point s ∈ S can be lifted to a mapping
ei : Spec(W2(k(s)) → eS. We denote by is : Xs → X the closed immersion deﬁned by the diagram

(with a cartesian square):

and by σs ∈ Ext2(LXs/s,OXs ) the associated obstruction class to lifting Xs/k(s) to W2(k(s)).
The Γ(S,OS)-module Ext2(LX/S,OX ) is in fact a set of global sections of the sheaf

and therefore by Lemma 3.8 we obtain a specialisation isomorphism:

ψs : Ext2(LX/S,OX ) ⊗OS k(s) = i∗R2f∗RHom(LX/S,OX )

≃ R2fs∗RHom(LXs/k(s),OXs ) = Ext2(LXs/k(s),OXs).

By Lemma A.6 we see that obstructions σf ∈ Ext2(LX/S ,OX ) and σs ∈ Ext2(LXs/k(s),OXs) ﬁt
into commutative diagram:

Li∗

and therefore the ﬁbre ψs([σf ]) of an obstruction class σf ∈ Ext2(LX/S,OX ) is equal to the
obstruction σs ∈ Ext2(LXs/s,OXs). Note that here we implicitly use the fact that the second part
of the isomorphism (2) in Lemma 3.8 is given by the diﬀerential dj. Constructibility then follows
from the fact that the zero set of a section of a ﬂat module is constructible (in fact it is closed for
a ﬁnitely generated module).

satisﬁes P .

In order to obtain a general statement for morphism which are not strongly equicohomological we
need the following lemma preceded with a notational remark. We say that a morphism f : X → S
can be stratiﬁed into morphisms satisfying property P if there exists a stratiﬁcation of the target

Si Si = S into locally closed subschemes Si ⊂ S such that the base change fi : X ×S Si → Si

Lemma 3.10. The following classes of morphism of schemes can be stratiﬁed into strongly equico-
homological morphisms:
i) proper morphisms,
ii) aﬃne morphisms of ﬁnite type.

Proof. We observe that stratiﬁcation is a purely topological notion and therefore we may assume
that S is integral. Now, it suﬃces to prove that for the classes in question there exists an open
subset U ∈ S such that fU : X ×S U → U is strongly equicohomological. In both cases we apply
the generic ﬂatness to prove a more general statement that for any complex E • ∈ D+
Coh(X) the
higher direct images are generically S-ﬂat. Firstly, we deal with aﬃne morphisms. In this case,
the higher direct images of any complex E • ∈ D+
Coh(X) are computed by taking the pushforwards
of the cohomology groups Hj(E •). Those are coherent sheaves on X and are therefore generically
S-ﬂat. Secondly, we treat the case of proper morphism. Now, higher direct images Rif∗E • are
coherent S-modules and therefore are generically ﬂat.

(cid:3)

We are now ready to state and prove the theorem.

Theorem 3.11. Suppose f : X → S is a morphism which can be stratiﬁed into strongly equicoho-
mological morphisms. Then, the set of closed points s ∈ S such that the ﬁber Xs
= X×S Spec(k(s))
lifts to W2(k(s)) is constructible.
Proof. Observe that in order to prove constructibility we may stratify the scheme S into locally
closed subsets. Therefore, by the assumption on existence of strongly equicohomological stratiﬁ-
cation, we may assume that : X → S is strongly equicohomological with a smooth aﬃne target.
Then, the result follows from Lemma 3.9.

(cid:3)

def

As a direct corollary of Lemma 3.10 and Theorem 3.11 we obtain:

Corollary 3.12. For any proper or aﬃne morphism f : X → S the set of closed points s ∈ S
such that the ﬁbre Xs lifts to W2(k(s)) is constructible.
3.4. Functorial W2(k)-lifting for Frobenius-split varieties. We now reprove the classical re-
sult stating that any Frobenius-split scheme X over k is W2(k)-liftable. For the standard reference
and Bhargav Bhatt’s proof in singular case the reader is encouraged to see Proposition 3.2. The
advantage of our approach is that we provide the lifting constructively and functorially with re-
spect to the splitting ϕ : FX∗OX → OX , in fact as a certain subscheme of the Witt scheme
(X, W2(OX )).
3.4.1. Functorial setting. We shall introduce our construction as a certain functor from the cate-
gory described as follows. By Frobenius split scheme we mean a pair (X, ϕX ) of a scheme over k
and a Frobenius splitting ϕX : F∗OX → OX . Moreover, a morphism of Frobenius split schemes
(X, ϕX ) and (Y, ϕY ) is a scheme morphism π : X → Y such that the splittings satisfy compatibility
conditions expressed by commutativity of the diagram:

OY

π#

π∗OX

ϕY

F #

π∗ϕX

π∗F #

F∗OY

F∗π∗OX = π∗F∗OX ,

i.e., the relation π# ◦ ϕY = (F∗π#)◦ (π∗ϕX ) holds. In case of an aﬃne morphism corresponding
to a homomorphism f : A → B this is equivalent to the equality f ϕA = ϕBf . The notions
described above allow us to introduce the category of Frobenius split varieties.
Deﬁnition 3.13. We deﬁne a category Schsplit
of Frobenius split schemes over k as a category with
the set of objects consisting of all Frobenius split schemes (X, φX ) and with the set of morphisms
consisting of morphism of Frobenius split schemes f : (X, φX ) → (Y, φY ).

3.4.2. Witt vectors. We shall need the following explicit description of Witt vectors.

Deﬁnition 3.14 (Witt vectors W2(A)). Suppose A is a commutative ring. We deﬁne the ring of
Witt vectors W2(A) to be the set A × A equipped with addition +W and multiplication ·W given
by the following formulas:

(3)

(4)

where P (a, b) is a polynomial (a+b)p−ap−bp

(a0, a1) +W (b0, b1) = (a0 + b0, a1 + b1 − P (a0, b0))
(a0, a1) ·W (b0, b1) = (a0b0, ap
0a1 + pa1b1),
∈ Z[a, b].

0b1 + bp

p

The unit element of W2(A) is represented by (1, 0) and, in case of Fp-rings, the prime number
p is represented by (0, 1). The natural projection (a0, a1) 7→ a0 gives a ring homomorphism π :
W2(A) → A. In case of characteristic p ring A, the ring W2(A) possesses a Frobenius endomorphism
σ2 : W2(A) → W2(A) given by the formula (a0, a1) 7→ (ap
1), which is compatible with the
Frobenius endomorphism F : A → A, i.e., the identity F π = πσ2 holds.
3.4.3. The construction of W ϕ
2 (A). We begin our considerations of explicit liftings of Frobenius
split schemes by the aﬃne case. A simple consequence of Corollary 2.2 is that a functorial construc-
tion A 7→ W2(A) does not give a ﬂat lifting (the ideal pW2(A) is not equal to Ker[W2(A) → A]).
We therefore proceed in a diﬀerent manner taking the Frobenius splitting into account. Let (A, ϕ)
by a k-algebra together with a Frobenius splitting ϕ. We claim that a ﬂat lifting of Spec(A)
over W2(k) is given by the following construction functorial with respect to natural mappings of
Fp rings with Frobenius splitting, i.e., ring homomorphisms commuting with p−1-linear splitting
operators.

0, ap

Deﬁnition 3.15. The ring of twisted Witt vectors W ϕ
2 (A) associated to a characteristic p ring
with a splitting (A, ϕ) is a set A × A with addition and multiplication given respectively by the
formulas:

def

(a0, a1) +ϕ (b0, b1)
(a0, a1) ·ϕ (b0, b1)

1) +W (b0, bp

which can also be described by the following diagrams:

The veriﬁcation that the above deﬁnition gives indeed a structure of an associative and com-

mutative ring is a straightforward computation. We are now ready to prove:

Theorem 3.16. Any morphism of Frobenius-split algebras f : (A, ϕA) → (B, ϕB) induces a
morphism of fW2 : W ϕA
2 (A) is a ﬂat W2(k)-lifting of A.

(B). Moreover, the ring W ϕ

2

(A) → W ϕB

2

Proof. Firstly, we observe that our construction is functorial. This follows directly from the
formulas for operations and the condition f ϕA = ϕBf .

Consequently, we show that W ϕ

2 (A) is ﬂat over W2(k). Clearly the projection onto the ﬁrst
factor gives a surjective ring homomorphism from W ϕ
2 (A) to A whose kernel I is given by the
ideal of elements of the form (0, a1) ∈ W ϕ
2 (A) for a1 ∈ A, which is generated by a single element
q = (0, 1). Note that the above diagrams prove that in case of a perfect ﬁeld k with a Frobenius
splitting γk(α) = p√α the bijective mapping id×F gives an isomorphism between the rings W γk
2 (k)
and W2(k). This consequently means that natural homomorphism W2(k) ≃ W γk
2 (k) → W ϕ
2 (A)
induced by the embedding k → A sends p = (0, 1) ∈ W2(k) to (0, 1) ∈ W ϕ
2 (A) and therefore q = p.
This allows us to apply Corollary 2.2 to conclude that W ϕ

2 (A) is indeed a ﬂat lifting of A.

3.4.4. Glueing to a twisted Witt scheme. In order to globalise the above construction we shall show
that it behaves well with respect to localisation. For this purpose, we prove the following lemma
resembling the computation given in [Blo77, Lemma 5.1].
Lemma 3.17. Let A be a k-algebra. For any lifting (f, c) ∈ W ϕ
homomorphism if : W ϕ

2 (A) of f ∈ A the natural

2 (Af ) is an isomorphism.

2 (A)(f,c) → W ϕ

Before proceeding to the proof, we present a series of useful equalities in W ϕ

2 (A) which follows

directly from addition and multiplication formulas:

(7)

(8)

(f, c)−1 = (1/f,−c/f 2)
(a, b)n = (an, nan−1b).

Proof of Lemma 3.17. The proof boils down to showing that if is bijective. To prove it, we ﬁrst
apply equalities (7) and (8) to obtain:

if(cid:18) (a, b)

(f, c)n(cid:19) = (a, b) ·ϕ(cid:18) 1

f n+1(cid:19) =(cid:18) a
f n , −nc
and then carry on with a straightforward inspection using the following two facts: (i) a
and only if f sa = 0 for some s ∈ N, (ii) the mapping Af ∋ d 7→ d− nac
of parameters (n, a, c).

= (a, b) ·ϕ(cid:18) 1

We are now ready to prove the theorem.

Theorem 3.18. There exists a functor W ϕ
to the category SchW2(k) of
schemes over the ring of second Witt vectors such that for every Frobenius split variety (X, ϕX )
the object W ϕ

2 from the category Schsplit

2 ((X, ϕX )) is a ﬂat lifting of X to W2(k).

k

Proof. In case of aﬃne schemes (Spec(A), φ) it is suﬃcient to use the construction of W φ
2 (A). In
general, we proceed as follows. For a scheme (X,OX ) we consider a ringed space (X, W ϕ
2 (OX ))
where W ϕ
2 (OX ) is a sheaf equal to OX × OX set theoretically and with ring structure deﬁned by
the assignment U 7→ W ϕ
2 (OX (U )). The sheaf transition maps are induced by the functoriality of
the the construction given in Theorem 3.16. Consequently, Lemma 3.17 proves that locally over
^
the aﬃne subset V = Spec(A) of (X,OX ), the sheaf W ϕ
2 (OX (V )) and
therefore (X, W ϕ
2 (OX )) is in fact a scheme over W2(k).

2 (OX )|V is isomorphic to

W ϕ

(cid:3)

3.5. Alternative view on the construction. As suggested by Piotr Achinger, the above con-
struction might be alternatively described as a certain subscheme of the second Witt scheme
(X, W2(OX )). Firstly, observe that W2(OX ) is an algebra extension of OX by the ideal FX∗OX .
The splitting ϕ gives rise to a subideal of FX∗OX given by Ker(ϕ) ≃ B1
(OX )
to be the quotient sheaf W2(OX )/ Ker(ϕ). We now prove:
Proposition 3.19. The constructions W ϕ
2 (OX ) and W ϕ,alt
(OX ) can be described by the following diagram:

(OX ) give rise to isomorphic schemes.

Proof. Indeed, the construction of W ϕ,alt

(OX ) are given by the lifting to W2(OX ) (e.g., id×F given in Deﬁnition 3.15), followed
by the corresponding operation in W2(OX ) and the reduction cϕ. This is exactly the description
given by the diagrams in Deﬁnition 3.15.

4. Frobenius liftability

We now proceed to the investigation of Frobenius liftability of aﬃne schemes. We begin with
functoriality of obstruction classes for lifting Frobenius, and then give a few examples. Conse-
quently we present a computational criterion for Frobenius liftability of aﬃne complete intersec-
tions which we then apply to the case of ordinary double points in dimension ≥ 4 and canonical
surface singularities.

we obtain the following result:

As an exemplary application we obtain a corollary:

Corollary 4.2. Let j : U → X be the inclusion of an open subset such that complement Z = X\ U
is of codimension ≥ 3 and X satisﬁes property S3 at any point of Z. Then, X admits a Frobenius
lifting if and only if U does.

Proof. Clearly, it suﬃces to show that Frobenius liftability of U implies liftability for X. For this
purpose we observe that by Lemma A.23 the deformation functors of U and X are isomorphic.

Hence, any lifting eU ∈ DefU (W2(k)) extends to a lifting eX ∈ DefX (W2(k)) and consequently we
may apply functoriality of obstructions Lemma 4.1 to the inclusion eU → eX. We obtain a diagram:

Example 4.3 (Frobenius liftability of toric varieties). Every aﬃne toric variety Spec(A)/k is
Frobenius liftable.

Proof. It is well-known that A is isomorphic to a k-algebra k[M ] associated to a ﬁnitely generated
monoid M . Its ﬂat lifting is given by W2(k)[M ] and the corresponding Frobenius lift is induced
by the monoid mapping M ∋ m 7→ pm.
(cid:3)
4.2. Computational criterion. In this section we present an explicit condition for the existence
of a lifting of the Frobenius morphism to a ﬁxed W2(k)-lifting

of an aﬃne scheme Spec(k[x1, . . . , xn]/(f1, . . . , fm)) (cf. Lemma 2.4). Then, we derive a compu-
tational criterion for the Frobenius liftability in the case of aﬃne complete intersection schemes
(in particular hypersurface singularities).

Spec(W2(k)[x1, . . . , xn]/(ef1, . . . ,ffm))

Before stating the criteria we need some auxiliary deﬁnitions and notation. We denote by R

the polynomial ring k[x1, . . . , xn], by eR its natural W2(k)-lifting W2(k)[x1, . . . , xn] (unique up to
isomorphism) and by eF : eR → eR the lifting of Frobenius morphism given by the formula:

X aI xI 7→X σ(aI )xpI ,

where I = (i1, . . . , in) is a multi-index, xI denotes the monomial xi1

1 ··· xin

n and σ is the Witt vector

Frobenius described in Section 1.1. Moreover, let w : eR → eR be the base change homomorphism

over σ : W2(k) → W2(k) deﬁned by:

w(cid:16)X aI xI(cid:17) =X σ(aI )xI .

Proof. Let I ⊳ k[x1, . . . , xn] be the ideal generated by the polynomials (f1, . . . , fm) and J ⊳

W2(k)[x1, . . . , xn] be the ideal generated by the their lifts (ef1, . . . ,ffm). Every Frobenius lift-
ing of B = eR/J comes from a homomorphism h : eR → eR over σ : W2(k) → W2(k), given by
the assignment xi 7→ xp
In order to get an
induced mapping B → B the ideal J should be mapped to itself. This boils down to the following

i + ji + p · hi for ji ∈ J, and W2(k) ∋ a 7→ σ(a).

element belonging to pB can be uniquely identiﬁed (by multiplication by p) with an element of

For any W2(k)-ﬂat ring B = W2(k)[x1, . . . , xn]/(ef1, . . . ,ffm) we see by Corollary 2.2 that any
A = B/p. In particular for any element ef ∈ eR there exists a unique element P (ef ) ∈ R satisfying
pP (ef ) = eF (ef ) − ef p.

Example 4.4. It turns out we have already seen an example of a polynomial P (f ). Namely, in
Proposition 3.3 we deﬁned a polynomial:

Pf2n = Xi1+...+in=p

i1,...,in6=p

(p − 1)!
i1!··· in!

(x1x2)i1 ··· (x2n−1x2n)in .

This is exactly −P (x1x2 + . . . + x2n−1x2n).

We are now ready to present the ﬁrst computational condition for the existence of a Frobenius

lift.

algebra A = k[x1, . . . , xn]/(f1, . . . , fm). Then, the Frobenius morphism of A lifts if and only
if there exists a sequence of elements hk ∈ R such that for every i ∈ {1, . . . , m} the element

We now restrict ourselves to the case of aﬃne complete intersection schemes and derive a
computationally feasible criterion to check whether they possess a W2(k)-lifting compatible with
Frobenius. For this purpose we ﬁrstly observe that:

(eF (ef + pg) − (ef + pg)p)

which implies that the choice of a diﬀerent lifting ef of f leads to the change of P (ef ) by an arbitrary

p-th power gp. This leads to a criterion:

Theorem 4.6. The aﬃne complete intersection algebra A = k[x1, . . . , xn]/(f1, . . . , fm) is Frobe-

As a corollary we obtain the criterion for Frobenius liftability of hypersurface singularities:

Remark 4.8. The equality above might be treated as a relation in the Frobenius push-forward
F∗ (k[x1, . . . , xn]/(f )). From this perspective, the polynomial Pf ∈ F∗ (k[x1, . . . , xn]/(f )) (module

4.3. Non-liftability of ordinary double points in any dimension. This section is devoted
to answering the question posed in [Bha14][Remark 3.14], whether the ordinary double points, in
particular cones over smooth projective quadrics, admit a lift to W2(k) compatible with Frobenius
in arbitrary dimensions. The negative answer is given by following Theorem 4.10.

Theorem 4.10 (Frobenius non-liftability of ordinary double points). Let n > 5 be an integer and
assume p > 3. Then the ordinary double points deﬁned by the equation f = x2
n + Q for
Q ∈ k[x1, . . . , xn]≥3 does not admit a W2(k)-lifting compatible with Frobenius.
Proof. For the proof, we need the lemma given in [Lan08] combined with the Proposition 3.3.
Lemma 4.11 ([Lan08], Proposition 3.1). Let k be a ﬁeld of characteristic p > 3 and 0 ≤ e < p be

h satisﬁes m ≥ 2p − 2. Indeed, if m < 2p − 2 then by lowest grade comparison and Lemma 4.11

4.4. Canonical singularities in positive characteristic are Frobenius liftable. In this sec-
tion, we present two diﬀerent approaches to proving that canonical singularities of surfaces are
F -liftable. The ﬁrst one is a direct computation using the criterion given in Corollary 4.7. The
second gives a slightly weaker result in the case of tame quotient singularities and exploits the
structure of the quotient together with functoriality of obstructions for lifting Frobenius morphism.
We note that in any characteristic the canonical surface singularities over algebraically closed ﬁeld
are classiﬁed by the dual graphs of the minimal resolution, which in turn correspond to Dynkin
diagrams of type A, D and E. Therefore, we shall use the terms canonical surface singularities and
ADE singularities interchangeably.

4.4.1. Direct computational approach. Firstly, we approach the F -liftability of ADE singularities
by a direct computation. By [Art77] under the assumption p ≥ 7 the ADE singularities are locally
analytically equivalent to the germs of the following form:

x2 + y2z + zn+1 = 0

x2 + y3 + z4 = 0
x2 + y3 + yz3 = 0

Equipped with this classiﬁcation we can approach the proof of the following:

Theorem 4.12. For any algebraically closed ﬁeld k of characteristic p ≥ 7 any aﬃne scheme X
with canonical surface singularities is Frobenius liftable.

Proof. Firstly, we observe that by Lemma A.12 it suﬃces to prove that for any x ∈ X the germ
Spec(OX,x) is Frobenius liftable. By Artin’s approximation theorem and the analytical classiﬁca-
tion of canonical singularities there exists a diagram of schemes:

&◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

Spec(OSADE,s),

where OSADE,s is the local ring at 0 of one of the aﬃne models given in Table 1. Therefore, by
Lemma A.11 and Lemma A.12, to prove Frobenius liftability of Spec(OX,x) it suﬃces to show that
the aﬃne models given in Table 1 are F -liftable.
The case of An−1 singularities simply follows from Example 4.3 as An−1 singularities are toric.
Consequently, we treat the case of Dn+2 singularities. The aﬃne model of Dn+2 is given by the
equation x2 + y2z + zn+1 = 0 and therefore by Corollary 4.7 we are left to show that:

x2i(y2z)jz(n+1)k ∈ (x2 + y2z + zn+1, xp, ypzp, y2p + (n + 1)pznp).

By substituting u = x2 = −y2z − zn+1 we see that it suﬃces to prove that:

(−1)i(y2z + zn+1)i(y2z)jz(n+1)k ∈ ((y2z + zn+1)⌈p/2⌉, ypzp, y2p + (n + 1)pznp).

The left hand side of the above relation is a sum of elements of the form (y2z)a · z(n+1)b for

a + b = p so it is enough to show that:

(y2z)az(n+1)b ∈ ((y2z + zn+1)⌈p/2⌉, ypzp, y2p + (n + 1)pznp),

for any a + b = p. The claim is clear for every a ≥ ⌈p/2⌉ and therefore we reason by contradiction.
Suppose a ≤ ⌊p/2⌋ is maximal with respect to the relation

(y2z)az(n+1)(p−a) 6∈ ((y2z + zn+1)⌈p/2⌉, ypzp, y2p + (n + 1)pznp).

As p − a ≥ ⌈p/2⌉ we can write

(y2z)a · z(n+1)(p−a) = (y2z)az(n+1)⌈p/2⌉z(n+1)(p−a−⌈p/2⌉)

i (cid:19)(y2z)iz(n+1)(⌈p/2⌉−i)

which gives a contradiction with the deﬁnition of a.

We now proceed to the case of E7. We shall prove that

By the trick as above, it suﬃces to prove that for any a + b = p we have
(yz3)ay3b ∈ ((y3 + yz3)⌈p/2⌉, 3y2p + z3p, ypz2p),

which follows by analogous reasoning by contradiction.

We ﬁnish with case of E2m singularities given by the aﬃne equation x2 + y3 + zm+1 for m = 3, 4.
By Corollary 4.7 to prove the existence of W2(k)-lifting compatible with Frobenius it suﬃces to
prove that

Xi+j+k=p(cid:0) p
i,j,k(cid:1)p

x2iy3jz(m+1)k ∈ (x2 + y3 + zm+1, xp, y2p, zmp).

After substituting u = x2, v = y3, w = zm+1 and s = u + v + w it suﬃces to show that:

Xi+j+k=p(cid:0) p
i,j,k(cid:1)p

uivj(s−u−v)k ∈ (s, u⌈p/2⌉, v⌈2p/3⌉, (s−u−v)⌈ mp

m+1 ⌉) = (s, u⌈p/2⌉, v⌈2p/3⌉, (u+v)⌈ mp

m+1 ⌉).

For this purpose, we prove that any monomial uivj ∈ k[u, v] for i + j = p appearing on the left
hand side belongs to (u⌈p/2⌉, u⌈2p/3⌉, (u + v)⌈ mp
m+1 ⌉), which is equivalent to the surjectivity of the
linear mapping deﬁned by:
m+1 ⌋ ∋ (f, g, h) 7→ f · u⌈p/2⌉ + g · u⌈2p/3⌉ + h · (u + v)⌈mp/(m+1)⌉.
k[u, v]⌊p/2⌋ × k[u, v]⌊p/3⌋ × k[u, v]⌊ p
After writing this in the basis given by monomials ukvj ordered lexicographically, to show sur-
, for

jectivity it is suﬃcient to show that the determinant of the matrix h(cid:0)⌈mp/(m+1)⌉

n = p − 1 − ⌊p/2⌋ − ⌊p/3⌋ is non-zero. By formula (2.1) in [Kra05], it is equal to:

(cid:1)i1≤i,j≤n

(⌈ mp

(s + i − 1)!(⌈ mp

and therefore we are done by the inequality ⌈ mp
4.4.2. Quotient singularity approach for F -liftability of canonical singularities. Here, we approach
the F -liftability of canonical singularities of surfaces using a diﬀerent method based on functoriality
of obstructions. We begin with a general result concerning F -liftability of quotients of smooth
schemes by ﬁnite groups, for which the action can be lifted to characteristic 0 (in fact, lifting mod
p2 would be suﬃcient). Subsequently, we investigate to which extent our method can be applied in
the case of canonical surfaces singularities. Our analysis is based on the results of [LS14, Section
4] describing whether ADE singularities admit a structure of a quotient singularity.

We precede our actual considerations by a few essential and standard remarks concerning base

Lemma 4.13. Let G be a ﬁnite group and let R be a commutative ring such that |G| is invertible
in R. Then, any R[G]-module M projective as an R-module is projective as an R[G]-module.

Proof. In order to prove that M is projective we need show that for any diagram of R[G]-modules:

M

/ N

/ 0

there exists an R[G]-linear homomorphism s : M → P such that f = p ◦ s. By the assumptions
we obtain an R-linear homomorphism σ : M → P such that f = p ◦ α. Consequently, by a direct
computation we obtain that a homomorphism deﬁned by the formula (i.e., the Reynolds operator):

s(m) =

|G|Xg∈G

gσ(g−1m)

is R[G]-linear and satisﬁes f = p ◦ s.

We now apply the above result to prove:

(cid:3)

Lemma 4.14. Let G be a ﬁnite group and let R be a commutative ring such that |G| is invertible
in R. Let M be a projective R-module together with an action of G. Then, for any homomorphism
R → S the natural mapping M G ⊗R S → (M ⊗R S)G is an isomorphism.
Proof. Firstly, by Lemma 4.13 we observe that M is a projective R[G]-module. Therefore, there
exists an R[G]-module N such that M ⊕ N ≃ R[G]I for some set of indices I. Consequently, we
obtain the following diagram:

(M ⊕ N )G ⊗R S

(R[G]I )G ⊗R S

/ (M ⊗R S)G ⊕ (N ⊗R S)G ≃ (R[G] ⊗R S)G,

which reduces our claim to the case of free modules. We ﬁnish by the following simple sequence
of identiﬁcations:

(R[G]I )G ⊗R S → RI ⊗R S → SI → (S[G]I )G → (R[G]I ⊗R S)G.

(cid:3)

As a corollary we obtain:

Corollary 4.15. Let G be a ﬁnite group and let R be a ring such that |G| is invertible in R. Then,
for every G-action over Spec(R) on An
Spec(R)/G is ﬂat over R. Moreover,
for every ring homorphism R → S the natural map:

Spec(R) the quotient An

is an isomorphism.

Spec(R)/G(cid:17) ×Spec(R) Spec(S) → An

Spec(S)/G.

Proof. Using the same idea as in Lemma 4.13 we prove that the ring of invariants R[x1, .., xn]G is
a direct sum of a ﬂat R-module R[x1, . . . , xn]. This implies that An
Spec(R)/G = Spec(R[x1, .., xn]G)
is ﬂat over R. The base change property is a direct consequence of Lemma 4.14.
(cid:3)

We are now ready to approach the following result concerning F -liftability of quotient singu-

larities.

Lemma 4.16 (Frobenius liftability of mod p reductions of quotients). Let G be a ﬁnite group
and let T be a spectrum of ﬁnitely generated Z-algebra ´etale over Spec(Z[1/|G|]). Suppose, G
acts on An
T relatively to T . Then, for every perfect ﬁeld k and a k-point t ∈ T (k) the scheme

Proof. Let t ∈ T (k) be k-point of T . By the formal lifting property of the ´etale map T → Spec(Z),
any point t ∈ T (k) can be lifted to a point et ∈ T (W2(k)). Consequently, by the ﬂatness of
T /G → T (see Corollary 4.15) we obtain a W2(k)-lifting (An

consequently allows us to apply Lemma 4.1 (for the upper square with mappings πt and πW2(k)) to
obtain our claim. More precisely, the Frobenius lifting of An

T /G)W2(k).

In order to apply Lemma 4.16 to the case of canonical singularities of surfaces we need some

results from [LS14]. First, let us recall the deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition 4.17. A scheme over a ﬁeld k has linearly reductive quotient singularities (resp. tame
quotient singularities) if it is ´etale equivalent to a quotient of a smooth k-scheme by a ﬁnite linearly
reductive group scheme (resp. ﬁnite ´etale group scheme of order prime to the characteristic of k).

It is proven in [LS14, Prop. 4.2] that except for a few characteristics all ADE singularities ﬁt
into the above deﬁnition. Moreover, from the proof we can infer the following result concerning
characteristic 0 liftability of group actions leading to ADE singularities:
Proposition 4.18. For any singularity type τ ∈ {An−1, Dn+2, E6, E7, E8} there exists a ﬁnite ﬂat
generically ´etale group scheme Λτ /Spec(Z) such that for every ﬁeld k the type τ singularity over k
arises as the quotient A2
k/Λk. The group scheme Λ is ´etale precisely over an open subset of Spec(Z)
where the corresponding group scheme quotient is tame (in the sense of the above deﬁnition).

Example 4.19. For example An−1 singularity over a ﬁeld k of arbitrary characteristic arises as
the quotient of A2
k/Λk by the natural action of the group scheme µn,k ≃ Λk = Λ ×Spec(Z) Spec(k)
for Λ = µn,Z. In this case, the scheme Λ/ Z is ´etale over Spec(Z[1/n]).

Finally, the details of the behaviour of canonical surface singularities with respect to character-

istic of the ﬁeld k can be summarised by the following table from [LS14, Section 4].

surfaces in the case they are tame quotient singularities.

Theorem 4.20 (Tame version of Theorem 4.12). Suppose X is an aﬃne surface over an alge-
braically closed ﬁeld k such that its singularities are tame quotient canonical surface singularities.
Then, X is Frobenius liftable.

Proof. Again by Lemma A.11 and Lemma A.12 it suﬃces to address the case of tame quotients.
By Proposition 4.18 and the tameness assumption there exists an open subset U = Spec(Z[1/N ]) ⊂
Spec(Z) and an ´etale group scheme Λ/U of rank coprime to N such that X ≃ A2

5. W2(k)-liftability and F -liftability compared to standard F -singularities

The following section contains the comparison of the classical F -singularity types, i.e., F -
regularity, F -purity and F -rationality with the notions of W2(k)-liftability and Frobenius liftability.
We work with F -ﬁnite rings, i.e, characteristic p > 0 rings such that F∗R is a ﬁnite R-module. In
particular, the F -ﬁniteness assumption is satisﬁed in the case of essential ﬁnite type algebras over
a ﬁeld k of characteristic p. We begin by recalling a few necessary deﬁnitions and criteria. Note
that we freely identify aﬃne schemes with their associated rings.

Deﬁnition 5.1 (F -regularity). Let R be a reduced F -ﬁnite ring of characteristic p > 0.
i) We say that R is F -regular if for any c ∈ R the mapping ϕe
ii) We say that R is F -pure if the mapping F : R → F∗R splits, i.e., the scheme Spec(R) is

1 7→ c splits for some e ≫ 0.
Frobenius split.

∗ R deﬁned by the formula

c : R → F e

It turns out that both of above properties can be veriﬁed locally, i.e., R is F -pure (respectively
strongly F -regular) if and only if for any maximal m ∈ Spec(R) the local ring Rm is F -pure
(respectively strongly F -regular).
In the case of quotients of F -ﬁnite regular rings the above
properties can be eﬃciently veriﬁed using the following criteria.

Lemma 5.2 (Fedder’s and Glassbrenner’s criteria). Let S be a F-ﬁnite regular ring such that F∗S
is a free S-module and let R = S/I. Then R is F -split at m ⊃ I if and only if I [p] : I 6⊂ m[p].
Moreover, let s be an element of S not in any minimal prime of I such that Rs is regular. Then,
R is strongly F -regular at m if and only if there exists an e ∈ N such that s(I [pe] : I) 6⊂ m

[pe].

Proof. For the proof see [Gla96, Theorem 2.3].

(cid:3)

Note that the assumptions of the above lemma are satisﬁed for S = k[x1, . . . , xn] and S regular
local. Moreover, in the special case I = (f ) the colon ideal I [pe] : I = (f pe−1) and therefore
F -purity boils down to an eﬃciently veriﬁable criterion f pe−1 ∈ m[pe].
Deﬁnition 5.3 (F -rational). Let (R, m) be a d-dimensional local ring of characteristic p > 0.
i) We say that R is F -rational if R is Cohen-Macaulay and if for any c ∈ R◦, there exists e ∈ N

such that cF e : H d

m(R) → H d

m(R) is injective.

We shall need the following lemma.

Lemma 5.4 (Watanabe a-invariant). Let (R, m) be a Cohen-Macaulay N-graded ring of dimension
d such that the punctured spectrum Spec(R) \ {m} is F -rational. Then, if the invariant a(R)
=
max{i ∈ Z : [H d
m(R)]i 6= 0} satisﬁes the inequality a(R) < 0 then for any n ≫ 0 the Veronese
subring R(n) is F -rational.

Proof. See [Sin98, Proposition 5.1.1].

there exists a lifting eX/W2(k) together with a lifting eF of Frobenius morphism F . Then, X is

Proof. The following is a simple extension of a proof given in [MS87] covering the smooth case. Let
n be the dimension of X and let U be the smooth locus of X. In case of smooth schemes liftability
of Frobenius is equivalent to the existence of a splitting ξ : Ω1
U of the Cartier mapping C (see
U ≃ F∗Ωn
[MS87]). After taking the n-th exterior power of ξ, we obtain a mapping ∧nξ : Ωn

We shall now present an example which violates the hypothesis of Theorem 5.5 in case of

non-normal schemes.

Proof. We apply Fedder’s criterion given in Lemma 5.2 and a simple fact that:

k is Frobenius liftable but not F -pure.

(x1x2(x1 + x2))p−1 ∈ (xp

i preserves the ideal x1x2(x1 + x2).

Frobenius liftability follows by observing that the canonical lifting of Frobenius of W2[x1, x2] given

Example 5.7. The cone over an ordinary elliptic curve is F -liftable but not strongly F -regular
or F -rational.
Proof. For for the sake of clarity, we focus on the case of a cone over Fermat cubic C = {x3 + y3 +
z3 = 0} ⊂ A3
k in characteristic p ≡ 1 (mod 3). Firstly, F -liftability follows from Corollary 4.7 by
a simple direct computation.
We verify that C is strongly F -regularity by means of Lemma 5.2. Indeed, we observe that for
any s ∈ m = (x1, x2, x3) we have sf pe−1 ∈ (x1, x2, x3)[pe] and consequently the cone is not strongly
F -regular at m. Finally, the proof of the fact that the cone C is not F -rational is the content of
[TW15, Example 2.6].
(cid:3)

Example 5.8. There exists an F -rational scheme which is not W2(k)-liftable.
Proof. Let X be a scheme embedded into Pn
k which is not W2(k)-liftable. By [LS14, Theorem 2.3]
we see that Y

ample projective embedding of Y satisﬁes our requirements, i.e., is F -rational and does not lift to

Indeed, using [AC11] and Leray spectral sequence we see that H i(Y,OY ) = 0 for i > 0, and
therefore we may apply Corollary 6.5 and Proposition 6.8 to obtain a projective embedding Y ⊂ PN
such that the cohomology groups H i(Y,OY (k)) vanish for i > 0 and k > 0, the cone CY

6. W2(k) and Frobenius liftability of cones over projective schemes

Here, we present a few result concerning cones over projective schemes. We begin with a series
of classical results (see, e.g., [Sch71, Art76]). Consequently, in Section 6.2.1 we extend the classical
results with a comparison theorem for Frobenius liftability.

For the purpose of clarity we present a few deﬁnitions and results concerning cones over pro-
jective schemes and their deformation. We begin by introducing the construction of a cone over a
closed embedding of a scheme into the projective space Pn def
k . For the sake of brevity we set
R = k[x0, . . . , xn].
6.1. Construction of a cone over a projective scheme. For any closed subscheme X ⊂ Pn
given by an ideal sheaf I, we denote by IX the homogeneous ideal:

= Pn

From the long exact sequence of cohomology associated to the short exact sequence:

def

IX

=Mk≥0
H 0(OPn ,I(k)) ⊳ R ≃Mk≥0
0 −→Mk≥0
I(k) −→Mk≥0
OPn (k) −→Mk≥0
we see that IX arises as the ﬁrst term in:
rX−−→Mk≥0

H 0(Pn,OPn(k)).

Deﬁnition 6.1. Suppose X ⊂ Pn = Proj(R) is a closed embedding of k-schemes. We deﬁne the
aﬃne cone over X ⊂ Pn to be an aﬃne scheme:

H 0(X,OX (k)) −→Mk≥0

H 1(Pn,I(k)) −→ 0.

We deﬁne the aﬃne cone, as follows.

Directly from the deﬁnition we see that:

For notational convenience, we denote by j : U = ConeX,Pn \ {m} → ConeX,Pn the inclusion of

U ≃ SpecX Mk∈Z OX (k)! → X,

where the isomorphism follows from the Grauert’s ampleness criterion (see EGA II 8.9.1). We
have the following standard proposition.
Proposition 6.3. Suppose X ⊂ Pn is a closed subscheme. The aﬃne scheme C
= ConeX,Pn is
normal if and only if X is itself normal and the restriction mapping rX is surjective. In this case,
C ≃ Spec(cid:0)Lk∈Z H 0(X,OX (k))(cid:1) ≃ Spec(H 0(U,OU )). Moreover, for i ≥ 1 the local cohomology
m (C,OC ) =Lk∈Z H i(X,OX (k)), as graded H 0(C,OC )-modules.

By the Serre’s vanishing theorem we see that there exists d such that for k ≥ d we have H 1(X, IX (k)) =
0, and therefore there exists d such that rX,d is surjective. This means that for d suﬃciently large
the cone over the Veronese embedding of X is normal.

Moreover, we have the corollary:

Corollary 6.5. Let X be a smooth projective scheme of dimension dim(X) = n > 2 satisfying
H i(X,OX ) = 0 for i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}. Then, for a suﬃciently ample embedding X ⊂ PN the cone
satisﬁes property Sn+1.

Proof. This follows directly from the local cohomology part of Proposition 6.3 and Serre vanishing.
(cid:3)

6.2. Deformation theory and cones. We now proceed to the summary of deformation theory
of cones. Again, X denotes a closed subscheme of Pn and we assume that C
= ConeX,Pn is normal
at its vertex (cf. Proposition 6.3). For a thorough exposition (in fact equicharacteristic) expressed
in classical terms of tangent sheaves one may take a look at [Art76, Section 11 and 12].

def

We begin with a proposition expressing the results of [Art76, Theorem 12.1, p. 48; Lemma

12.1, p. 53].

−→ DefC deﬁned
Proposition 6.6. There exists a morphism of deformation functors φ : HilbX,Pn
by performing cone construction relatively. The tangent and obstruction mappings of φ satisfy the
properties:

X,Pn → TDefC can be identiﬁed with the canonical homomor-

phism

coming from the long exact cohomology sequence associated to

0 −→Mk∈Z TX (k) −→Mk∈Z TPn |X(k) −→Mk∈Z NX/ Pn (k) −→ 0,

iii) The obstruction mapping Obφ is injective.

ii) The tangent mapping Tφ is surjective ifLk6=0 H 1(X,TX (k)) = 0.
Proof. For the proof, we refer to [Art76]. The identiﬁcation of the tangent space TDefC =
Ext1(LC/k,OC ) with the given cokernel follows from an explicit calculation of the long exact
sequence of Ext(−,OC ) groups for a distinguished triangle:

Li∗LAn+1/k −→ LC/k −→ LC/An+1 −→ Li∗LAn+1/k[1]

associated with the inclusion of schemes i : C → An+1.

(cid:3)

As a corollary we obtain the following result comparing the deformation theory of a projective

scheme X and the cone over its suﬃciently large ample embedding.

Corollary 6.7. Let X be a projective scheme. Then, there exists a suﬃciently large Veronese
embedding of X ⊂ Pn into PNd such that the morphism of functor φd : HilbX,PNd → Def Cone
is smooth.

X,PNd

Proof. Firstly, by consideration following Proposition 6.3 we see that by taking suﬃciently large
Veronese embedding we may assume that the cone is in normal. This allows us to apply Proposi-

tion 6.6. By part ii), we need to show that for suﬃciently large d we haveLk6=0 H 1(X,TX (kd)) = 0.

This in turn follows from Serre’s vanishing and Serre duality.

(cid:3)

By combining Lemma A.21 with Corollary 6.7 we obtain:

Proposition 6.8. For any smooth projective scheme X satisfying H 2(X,OX ) = 0 and a suﬃ-

As a simple corollary, we see that a characteristic p projective scheme X admits a W2(k)-lifting

if and only if an appropriate cone does.

6.2.1. Frobenius liftability of cones over suﬃciently ample embeddings. We shall now relate the
Frobenius liftability of a normal projective scheme and a cone over its suﬃciently ample embedding.

Proposition 6.9. Let X be a normal projective scheme. Then, for a suﬃciently ample embedding
X ⊂ Pn the Frobenius liftability of C = ConeX,Pn implies the Frobenius liftability of X. Moreover,
for any smooth scheme X satisfying H 1(X,OX ) = H 2(X,OX ) = 0 Frobenius liftability of X is
equivalent to the Frobenius liftability of a cone over a suﬃciently ample embedding.

Proof. The ﬁrst part we proceed as follows. Let C = ConeX,Pn be the cone over an embedding
of X such that the functor φ : HilbX,Pn → DefC is smooth (cf. Corollary 6.7). Moreover, let
U be the cone without the vertex m. Assume C is Frobenius liftable, i.e, there exists a lifting

eC ∈ DefC (W2(k)) admitting a lifting of Frobenius. By the smoothness of φ we obtain a (potentially

non-unique) diagram:

assumed that eC admits a lifting a therefore σF
For the second, we assume that X is Frobenius liftable, i.e., there exists a lifting eX ∈ DefX (W2(k))

compatible deformation eC ∈ DefC (W2(k)) of the cone C. By Corollary 4.2 in order to prove that
eC admits a Frobenius lift it suﬃces to infer it for eU. By functoriality of obstructions to lifting

Appendix A. Deformation theory

Oftentimes we resign from giving proofs and refer to the standard works, e.g, [Ill72, Sch68,
FM98]. In the part concerning cotangent complex and obstruction classes, the reader may freely
ignore the technical proofs and focus on the statements concerning functoriality.

A.1. Deformation theory in terms of cotangent complex. We begin with the relevant topics
in deformation theory (see [Ill72, Part I, Chapitre III]) based on the notion of cotangent complex
LX/S. We begin with the basic properties of Kodaira-Spencer class KX/Y /S and consequently we
express the deformation obstruction classes in terms of KX/Y /S and other natural extensions.
Deﬁnition A.1 (Kodaira-Spencer class). For any f : X → Y an S-morphism of schemes there
exists a mapping KX/Y /S : LX/Y → Lf ∗LY /S[1] in D(X) called a Kodaira-Spencer class. It is
deﬁned as the connecting homomorphism in a natural distinguished triangle of cotangent complexes
associated to f :

A.1.1. Lifting schemes - functoriality of obstruction classes. We now recall the obstruction theory

expressed in terms of cotangent complex. We consider i : Y → eY , a square-zero S-extension of Y
by an OY -module J . Apart from functoriality all the results are given in [Ill72]. We begin with a
classiﬁcation of S-extensions.
Theorem A.2. There exists a bijection between the group ExalS(Y,J ) of isomorphism classes of
S-extension of Y by an OY -module J and the group Ext1(LY /S,J ).
Proof. See [Ill72, Part I, Chapitre III, Th´eor`eme 1.2.3].

Theorem A.4. For any deformation tuple as above, there exists an obstruction σX ∈ Ext2(LX/Y ,I)

If the
obstruction vanishes, the liftings constitute a torsor under Ext1(LX/S,I). In particular, the ob-
struction class for the existence of a ﬂat lifting eX → eY is an element of Ext2(LX/Y , f ∗J ).

Proof. For the proof see [Ill72, Part I, Chapitre III, Th´eor`eme 2.1.7].

Liftability obstructions satisfy the following functoriality property (for the sake of convenience

we assume the ideals of thickenings are ﬂat).

c) commutativity of the lower part of the diagram in the deﬁnition of morphism of deformation

tuples (middle square),

d) the assumption on the homomorphisms of ﬂat ideals (right-most square).

We consequently derive the following diagram which is constituted by boundary arrows.

A.2. Deformations of aﬃne schemes. In this section we present a few results concerning
deformation theory of aﬃne schemes. In particular, we prove that one can check the existence of
a W2(k)-lifting ´etale locally.
Lemma A.11. Let X ≃ Spec(A) be an aﬃne scheme essentially of ﬁnite type over k. Assume
there exists an ´etale surjective covering p : U → X such that U is W2(k)-liftable (respectively
F -liftable). Then, X is W2(k)-liftable (respectively F -liftable).

Proof. We treat the case of W2(k)-liftability as the proof in the case of F -liftability is analogous. By
taking an aﬃne Zariski covering of U we may assume that U ≃ Spec(B). Let σA ∈ Ext2(LA/k, A)
and σB ∈ Ext2(LB/k, B) be the obstruction classes to the existence of a W2(k)-lifting of Spec(A)
and Spec(B), respectively. By Lemma A.6 and the properties of the morphism p we see that
Ext2(LB/k, B) ≃ Ext2(LA/k, A) ⊗A B and σB = σA ⊗ 1 under this isomorphism. Therefore, the
claim of the lemma follows from the fact that p is ´etale and surjective and hence faithfully ﬂat. (cid:3)

Along the same lines we can prove the following.

Lemma A.12. Let X be an aﬃne scheme locally of ﬁnite type over k. Assume that for any
closed point x ∈ X the scheme Spec(OX,x) is W2(k)-liftable (respectively F -liftable). Then, X is
W2(k)-liftable (respectively F -liftable).

A.3. Deformation functors and their morphisms. Here, we recall the formalism of functors
of Artin rings. The classical reference for the topic is [Sch68]. The results concerning obstruction
theories are well-explained in [FM98].

Suppose k be a ﬁeld, Λ a complete local ring and let Art(Λ, k) denote the category of local
Artinian Λ-algebras with residue ﬁeld k. We consider covariant functors F : Art(Λ, k) → Sets,
which naturally represent inﬁnitesimal deformations of algebraic and geometric objects. The case
we are mostly interested in is Λ = W2(k) where k is a perfect ﬁeld of positive characteristic p.

Deﬁnition A.13 (Functor of Artin rings). A functor of Artin rings is a covariant functor F :
Art(Λ, k) → Sets such that F (k) consists of a single element. All such functors form a category
with natural transformations as morphisms.

Any surjective morphism in Art(Λ, k) can be decomposed into a sequence of small extensions,
i.e., ring surjections (B, mB) −→ (A, mA) with kernel I satisfying mBI = 0. Small extensions
naturally form a category SmallExt(Λ, k) whose objects are small extensions and morphisms are
diagrams:

0

0

/ I

φ

/ I ′

B

A

0

f2

f1

/ B′

/ A′

/ 0,

where f1, f2 are rings homomorphisms and φ is an induced homomorphism of k-vector spaces.
Deﬁnition A.14 (Smooth morphism of functors). A natural transformation ξ : F → G of functors
of Artin rings is smooth if for every surjective morphism B → A in Art(Λ, k) the natural mapping:

is surjective.

F (B) → F (A) ×G(A) G(B)

From the special case A = k, we see that a smooth morphism is surjective.

Deﬁnition A.15 (Tangent space and morphism). Suppose F : Art(Λ, k) → Sets is a functor of
= F (k[ε]) is called the tangent space of a functor F . For any morphism
Artin rings. The set TF
of deformation functors ψ : F → G the mapping Tψ
= ψk[ε] : TF = F (k[ε]) → G(k[ε]) = TG is
called the tangent map of ψ.

def

def

Under certain condition (see [FM98]), satisﬁed in any of our applications, the tangent space
admits a natural structure of a k-vector space such that the tangent morphism becomes k-linear.
Deﬁnition A.16 (Obstruction theory). Suppose F : Art(Λ, k) → Sets is a functor of Artin
rings. An obstruction theory for F is a pair (V,{νe}e∈SmallExt(Λ)) of a vector space V and a family
of mappings νe : F (A) → V ⊗k I parametrised by inﬁnitesimal extensions e : 0 −→ I −→ B −→
A −→ 0 and satisfying the following properties:

we have (idV ⊗φ) ◦ νe = νe′ ◦ F (f1).
a ∈ F(A) the condition νe(a) = 0 is equivalent to existence of b ∈ F(B) lifting a.
The choice of obstruction theory is not unique, e.g., any proper inclusion i : V → V ′ gives rise
We now present a criterion for smoothness of morphism of functors in terms of their tangent
and obstruction spaces. Let (F , (ObF , νF
e )) be deformation functors together
with associated obstruction theories and ψ : F → G be a morphism. We say that a linear mapping
c : ObF → ObG is an obstruction map of ψ if for every inﬁnitesimal extension e : 0 −→ I −→
B −→ A −→ 0 we have νG
e . We emphasize that the notion of obstruction
map of ψ does not depend solely on ψ but also on the choice of obstruction theories for F and G.

e ◦ ψA = (c ⊗k idI ) ◦ νF

e )) and (G, (ObG, νG

We have the following criterion.

Lemma A.17 (Smoothness criterion for morphism of functors). Suppose (F , (ObF , νF
e )) and
(G, (ObG, νG
e )) are deformation functors together with associated obstruction theories. Let ψ : F →
G be a morphism of functors admitting an obstruction map Obψ : ObF → ObG. Then, ψ is smooth
if the following conditions hold:
i) Tψ : TF → TG is surjective,
ii) Obψ : ObF → ObG is injective.
Proof. See [FM98, Lemma 6.1].

(cid:3)

We now give two examples relevant in what follows.

Example A.18 (Abstract deformations of a scheme). Suppose X is a scheme over a ﬁeld k. The
functor of abstract deformations DefX : Art(Λ, k) → Sets is deﬁned by the assignment:
Art(Λ, k) ∋ A 7→ { isomorphism classes of ﬂat deformations of X over Spec(A) } ,

where a deformation consists of a ﬂat scheme X over Spec(A) together with an isomorphism
φX : X ×Spec(A) Spec(k) → X. Morphism of deformations (X , φX ) → (X ′, φX ′) is a morphism of
schemes X → X ′ such that its restriction to the special ﬁbre commutes with isomorphisms φ.
By the results of Theorem A.4 the tangent space of the abstract deformation functors DefX is
equal to Ext1(LX/k,OX ). Moreover, it admits an obstruction theory with the obstruction space
equal to Ext2(LX/k,OX ).
Example A.19 (Embedded deformations of a projective scheme). Suppose X ⊂ Pn
k is a closed
subscheme. The functor of embedded deformations HilbX,Pn : Art(Λ, k) → Sets is deﬁned by the
assignment:
ﬂat over Spec(A) and restricting to X over Spec(k)) .

Art(Λ, k) ∋ A 7→( isomorphism classes of closed subschemes of Pn

A

By [Har09, Chapter I] the tangent space of HilbX,Pn is naturally isomorphic to H 0(X,NX/ Pn ).
Furthermore, it admits an obstruction theory with the obstruction space equal to H 1(X,NX/ Pn ).

We now present an exemplary application of Lemma A.17.

Example A.20. For any closed embedding X ⊂ Pn of a smooth scheme X/k, we obtain a natural
morphism of functors ψ : HilbX,Pn → DefX admitting an obstruction morphism deﬁned by taking
the underlying abstract deformation of an embedded deformation. Its tangent and obstruction
mappings:

Tψ : THilb

X,Pn = H 0(X,NX/ Pn ) → H 1(X,TX ) ≃ Ext1(LX/k,OX ) = TDefX
Obψ : ObHilbX,Pn = H 1(X,NX/ Pn ) → H 2(X,TX ) ≃ Ext2(LX/k,OX ) = ObDefX

are given by the canonical morphisms coming from the long exact sequence of cohomology associ-
ated to:

0 −→ TX −→ TPn |X −→ NX/ Pn −→ 0.

As a simple corollary of Lemma A.17 we have the following lemma applicable for example to
projective Calabi-Yau varieties of dim X > 3.
Lemma A.21. Suppose X is a projective scheme satisfying H 2(X,OX ) = 0. For suﬃciently
positive embedding of X ⊂ Pn the morphism ψ : HilbX,Pn → DefX is smooth. In particular, every
abstract deformation arises as an embedded one.
Proof. By Lemma A.17 we need to show that H 0(X,NX/ Pn ) → H 1(X,TX ) is surjective and
H 1(X,NX/ Pn ) → H 2(X,TX ) is injective for suﬃciently ample embedding X → Pn. By the long
exact sequence of cohomology it suﬃces to show that H 1(X,TPn |X ) = 0. By restricting the Euler
sequence to X we obtain:

By another long exact sequence of cohomology we see that:

0 −→ OX −→ OX (1)⊕n+1 −→ TPn |X −→ 0.

··· −→ H 1(X,OX (1)⊕n+1) −→ H 1(X,TPn |X ) −→ H 2(X,OX ) −→ ··· ,

which gives the claim by the Serre’s vanishing, i.e., for any coherent sheaf F on X we have
H 1(X,F (1)) = 0 if the embedding X → Pn is suﬃciently ample.
Remark A.22. In particular, for suﬃciently positive Veronese embedding of a smooth scheme X
satisfying H 2(X,OX ) = 0, the mapping of functors ψd : HilbX,PNd → DefX is smooth.

(cid:3)

We ﬁnish with a lemma comparing abstract deformation functors of a scheme X and its open
subset U . We give a proof based on the cotangent complex. For the classical proof the reader is
encouraged to see [Art76, Proposition 9.2].
Lemma A.23. Let j : U → X be the inclusion of an open subset. Assume, that X satisﬁes property
S3 at any point p of the complement Z = X \ U . Then, the natural morphism of deformation
functors χj : DefX → DefU coming from the restriction is smooth.
Proof. By the long exact sequence of Ext(LX/k,−) groups associated to a distinguished triangle:

OX −→ Rj∗OU −→ Kj −→ OX [1]

we obtain a sequence:
. . . −→ Ext0(LX/k, Kj) −→ Ext1(LX/k,OX )
−→ Ext1(LX/k, Kj) −→ Ext2(LX/k,OX )

tj−→ Ext1(LX/k, Rj∗OU ) ≃ Ext1(LU/k,OU ) −→
oj−→ Ext2(LX/k, Rj∗OU ) ≃ Ext2(LU/k,OU ) −→ . . . ,
where the mappings tj and oj can be identiﬁed with Tχj and Obχj . Therefore, by Lemma A.17,
it suﬃces to prove that Ext1(LX/k, Kj) = 0. This is a direct consequence of the spectral sequence

Extp(LX/k,Hq(Kj)) ⇒ Extp+q(LX/k, Kj)

and the following lemma:
Lemma A.24 (Local cohomology in terms of Kj). For any i ∈ Z the sheaf Hi(Kj) is isomorphic
^
Z (U,OU ). Consequently, if X satisﬁes property Sn+1 at
to the local cohomology sheaves
any point of Z = X \ U of codimension at least n + 1 then Hi(Kj) = 0 for i ≤ n.
Proof. For the proof see [Sta15, Tag 0A39] and [HK04, Proposition 3.3].
