Abstract

A thin ﬂat rectangular plate supported on its edges and subjected to in-plane loading exhibits stable
post-buckling behaviour. However, the introduction of a nonlinear (softening) elastic foundation may
cause the response to become unstable. Here the post-buckling of such a structure is investigated and
several important phenomena are identiﬁed, including the transition of patterns from stripes to spots and
back again. The interaction between these forms is of importance for understanding the possible post-
buckling behaviours of this structural system. In addition, both periodic and some localized responses
are found to exist as the dimensions of the plate are increased and this becomes relevant when the
characteristic wavelengths of the buckle pattern are small compared to the size of the plate. Potential
application of the model range from macroscopic industrial manufacturing of structural elements to the
understanding of micro- and nano-scale deformations in materials.

1 Introduction

Instability in elastic bodies is of practical importance to engineers who are responsible for the design of
safe structures.
If our sole concern was to understand the initial stages of buckling of such bodies then
a suitable model consisting of linearized equations would serve the purpose. On the other hand a deeper
appreciation of the true nature of the buckling together with knowledge of the properties of later stages of
the failure mechanisms requires that nonlinear eﬀects be included as well. In the overwhelming majority
of post-buckling scenarios exact analytical solutions do not exist and so, necessarily, we have to resort to
approximation, be it fully numerical or a simpliﬁcation of the full system followed by analysis in various
limited regimes [28]. Both of these strategies can reveal behaviour which is of interest not only to engineers
but to applied scientists and mathematicians as well.
Instability phenomena are becoming of increasing
importance in many ﬁelds [6] and some previous studies are being given renewed prominence owing to the
discovery of physical phenomena down to the atomic level which these theories seem to model well [22]. It
is in this spirit that here we study a problem that at ﬁrst sight seems to be a simplistic two-dimensional
extension of an exhaustively-studied one, namely the buckling of a strut resting on an elastic foundation.

In structural engineering, plates are used as load-bearing elements in various guises, including ﬂoor slabs,
retaining walls, pad foundations, ship hulls and aircraft wings. Of these, perhaps the pad would most
naturally be modelled by a plate on a foundation. There are examples where certain parts of structural
components can be modelled as plates which are supported; an obvious candidate is a sandwich panel
for which a core supports a pair of thin skins. Several of these problems have been examined assuming

1

one-dimensional behaviour and our intention is to extend these ideas to incorporate a second dimension.
Moreover the importance of supported plates is not limited to large-scale structures for similar systems have
been proposed as models to look at thin elastic ﬁlms supported by a substrate. There has been much work
on one-dimensional wrinkling (another form of buckling) either when a specimen is compressed or if the
supporting substrate (foundation) is pre-stretched when the elastic layer is placed on it and is then released.
The plate equations for such a conﬁguration have been solved using a ﬁnite-element technique and compared
with experimental data [3]. Moreover, rather than just being an unfortunate by-product of loading, wrinkling
in some physical systems may actually be desirable and its control can be eﬀected by judicious application
of load in various directions [38].

At an even smaller scale, studies have shown that wrinkling of nano-scale materials can be suﬃcient to
modify electrical, optical and other physical properties. In particular compressed graphene behaves in this
way and a useful model for this material is that of an isolated elastic layer [35]. We believe that improved
understanding of wrinkling in nano-materials might be gained by incorporating a supporting elastic medium
as an integral part of the system.

The well-studied one-dimensional strut model has numerous applications from the buckling of submarine
pipelines and railway tracks through to sandwich panels and as a phenomenological model for various shell
structures [7, 24, 27]. Various mathematical techniques have been utilized to study this system including
Rayleigh–Ritz and Galerkin analyses [34], multiple-scale perturbation expansions [16, 20] and advanced
hyperasymptotic methods [8, 32]. Part of the motivation for this ﬂurry of activity has been the fact that
the strut model can be regarded as a member of a family of problems governed by a Swift–Hohenberg (SH)
equation. The SH equation is a partial diﬀerential equation in both time and space that simpliﬁes to an
ordinary diﬀerential equation (ODE) form when interest is restricted to time-invariant behaviour in one
spatial dimension. Static equilibria and their stability can readily be deduced from this reduced problem. A
key distinction between the strut and plate models is that the former is of unbounded length—suitable for
the study of very long structures—and solutions sought can be periodic or homoclinic (localized in extent)
where deﬂection approaches zero in both positive and negative directions [31]. In reality of course, at least
at the macroscopic scale, plates are ﬁnite and the choice of boundary conditions potentially have a greater
eﬀect on the response of the system to load than if they are modelled as being completely remote from the
location of the buckle pattern. Nevertheless, if situations arise for which the deﬂection is restricted to a small
portion of the structure then we could say such buckle patterns are eﬀectively localized in an engineering
sense although not homoclinic according to a strict mathematical deﬁnition.

In order to make headway with our stated goal of introducing a second spatial dimension, it may seem
natural to simply investigate the appropriate planar version of the SH equation; see for example [1, 23]
for several investigations into 2D localized patterns possible with the planar SH. However, extending in a
simple-minded manner hides the complication that a ﬂat plate may respond in other ways when loaded.
For instance, there is now the possibility of bending about two axes and twisting which gives the plate
extra stiﬀness and hence oﬀers a good solution for eﬃcient design [29]. Furthermore, compatibility and the
constitutive equations arising from the theory of elasticity need to be satisﬁed and this adds extra terms
together with the need to introduce a new stress function which relates deformations and strains to stresses.
For moderate to large deﬂections the bending of a ﬂat plate is often modelled by the F¨oppl–von K´arm´an
(FvK) equations for, although it is known that they have some limitations and inconsistencies, they have
been shown to usefully model post-buckling plate behaviour at a qualitative level that is normally accurate
enough for most engineering purposes [9].

We aim to study here the case where the behaviour of an elastic plate is modiﬁed owing to the presence of
a supporting elastic foundation or substrate on which it rests. Depending on the detailed properties of the
foundation diﬀerent phenomena can be realized. We will discuss the various diﬀerent buckling modes that
are possible and how they relate to each other as the loading on the plate is varied. In order to demonstrate
the potential usefulness of the plate model, we will mention a few examples from various ﬁelds that might

conditions are applied on the long edges (denoted by the thick lines) while Neumann conditions are imposed on the
shorter sides (dashed lines). The in-plane loading is ¯Px and ¯Py in the ¯x and ¯y directions respectively. The continuous
foundation is represented as a series of elastic springs with resistance ¯F given by (2.2)

beneﬁt from our ﬁndings.

An important feature of the plate model is that it necessarily involves separate loading parameters from two
directions. For the one-dimensional strut any loading acts at a point and so cannot vary spatially but in
two directions this constraint has to be relaxed; the loading in either direction need not be constant and, in
general, would vary with position. Moreover proper consideration has to be taken of the aspect ratio of the
plate. One might na¨ıvely expect that a long thin plate might well respond to loading in a way similar to
that of a strut but if the two dimensions of the plate are comparable then it is far from clear what one might
expect to happen. It would not be surprising if in this case distinct phenomena occur that are peculiar to
the strictly two-dimensional case.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In §2, the model is formally introduced and in §3 a
Galerkin method is used to obtain approximate buckling solutions which emerge from the ﬂat fundamental
state. These Galerkin predictions suggest how to conduct eﬃcient full numerical solutions. A dynamical
stability analysis described in §4 establishes criteria that predict when a one-dimensional (striped) solution
may be unstable to transverse instability leading to a fully two-dimensional pattern. Fully numerical solutions
are obtained and described in §5 and these are compared directly with the earlier results. The paper closes
in §6 with some conclusions of the work and a look forward to possible further investigations of the problem.

2 Model formulation

The FvK equations for plates [29] have been shown to provide an accurate model for post-buckling be-
haviour and an analysis demonstrates that the naturally emerging post-buckling solutions are periodic in
two orthogonal directions with the formation of a rectangular cellular pattern of undulations [13].

We consider a thin ﬂat plate made of a homogeneous and isotropic material of Young’s modulus E, Poisson’s
ratio ν and with thickness h as shown in Figure 1. The co-ordinate axes are aligned so that the mid-surface
of the plate sits in the ¯x-¯y plane and the structure is supported in the ¯z-direction by an elastic foundation.
Buckling is described by a system derived from the classical von K´arm´an equations [29] with the addition
of terms accounting for the supporting elastic foundation together with an acceleration term based on the
time ¯t [2]. The incorporation of this acceleration will enable us to later examine the temporal stability of

¯x¯y − ¯w¯x¯x ¯w¯y ¯y

(2.1a)

(2.1b)

in which ∇4
denotes the biharmonic operator with respect to ¯x and ¯y and all subscripts on variables (but
not parameters) denote partial diﬀerentiation with respect to the appropriate variable. Moreover D =
Eh3/(12(1− ν2)) denotes the bending stiﬀness of the plate, ¯w(¯x, ¯y, ¯t) is its lateral displacement and ¯φ(¯x, ¯y, ¯t)
the corresponding stress function. We note that the terms proportional to ¯Px and ¯Py account for the in-plane
loading in the ¯x and ¯y directions respectively.

The crucial diﬀerence between our model and that for a plate supported only on its edges is the presence
of the foundation resistance ¯F ( ¯w) that acts across the plate. Here, following the methodology used for the
corresponding strut problem, we take ¯F to be of Winkler type [20] so that it is solely dependent on lateral
deﬂection w and no shear interaction is present; then

¯F ( ¯w) = ¯k1 ¯w − ¯k2 ¯w2 + ¯k3 ¯w3,

(2.2)

where the ¯kj are constants and and whose values we discuss below.
Let us take the plate to be rectangular of dimensions a× b with the thickness h (cid:28) a, b. Appropriate physical
boundary conditions can then be of various types. The edges may be unsupported (free), simply-supported
(that prevents deﬂection but allows rotation) or fully ﬁxed. Each one of these conditions supplies two
kinematic conditions on the deﬂection or its derivatives. We will study the case of clamped edges in the
¯y-direction and a periodic displacement along the ¯x-direction to simulate a thin layer bonded to the elastic
foundation [38]. The cases we will study will consist of a plate with one of its centre lines on the ¯x-axis with
length a and width b

¯w(¯x,±b/2) = ¯w¯y(¯x,±b/2) = 0,
¯w¯x(0, ¯y) = ¯w¯x(a, ¯y) = ¯w¯x¯x¯x(0, ¯y) = ¯w¯x¯x¯x(a, ¯y) = 0 ,

(2.3)

with similar conditions imposed on ¯φ. Note that the conditions along the ¯x-axis resemble the symmetric-
section conditions used when seeking localized solutions to the one-dimensional strut model [20]. We will
consider plates of various length in the ¯x direction but, if periodic solutions are sought, then it suﬃces to
use Neumann boundary conditions as above.
Let us pause here to consider the choice of the nonlinear foundation, ¯F , with a softening characteristic.
Of course linearity is often an assumption made in order to simplify calculation or to deduce ﬁrst-order
behaviour. If we wish to delve deeper into phenomena then higher-order terms need to be considered and if
we write out the response of the foundation as a Taylor series then it would seem natural next to incorporate
a quadratic term. However, if we wish to explore a symmetric response with respect to vertical displacement
then at least a cubic terms needs to be included as well. To decide the appropriate form of this term it should
be remembered that in civil engineering contexts the foundation medium is frequently some form of soil.
Most soils are a complex mixture of mineral particles and varying degrees of water content packed together
in an irregular manner with many voids present. The interaction of solid granular particles, water and air is
diﬃcult to model but bulk properties can be derived and are often represented as a linear plus a softening
leading-order nonlinear term with a negative coeﬃcient. Where other structural systems such as sandwich
panels have been modelled using a strut- or plate-on-foundation model similar softening nonlinearities have
been introduced into the foundation to good eﬀect [17, 19]. The rationale behind such an approximation is
given in terms of the bulk behaviour of the central core material which is often a foam and its voids initially
undergo collape when loading but then may subsequently restabilize due to contact of the solid walls of the
material. The restabilization is modelled by a higher degree polynomial term with a positive coeﬃcient.

4

In material manufacture, the response of an elastic substrate supporting the material has a complicated
interaction relationship. To ﬁrst order, it is often modelled as linear but as deformations develop, nonlinear
responses are often observed [38] and can have signiﬁcant eﬀect on the overall behaviour of the material. In
both of the above scenarios, the softening is only the initial deviation from nonlinearity for there is often
some recovery of stiﬀness (restabilization) when higher-order kinematic eﬀects are taken into account. We
model this as the next order (cubic) term having a positive sign.

2.1 Non-dimensionalization

In order to analyse the system, it is helpful to scale variables to remove as many coeﬃcients as possible.
Therefore we set

¯x = λx,

¯y = λy,

¯w = µ1w,

¯φ = µ2φ,

¯t = ξt

In this scaled state, we suppose that the plate has length L and width γ.

2.1.1 Loading parameters and some simpliﬁcations

In the general nonlinear plate problem the loading parameters in the x and y directions, Px and Py, should
be treated as independent. There is no necessity for either to be constant in space and such variation is
likely to be of interest in provoking other behaviours such as bending about a lateral axis. We defer this
extra degree of freedom as a reﬁnement to be dealt with in a future study and instead concentrate solely on
the case where both Px and Py are constant. That said, we will allow the possibility of either load being
compressive (positive) or tensile (negative). It is conceptually easy to envisage diﬀerent loading in the two
directions: the simplest of course being uniaxial compression. Furthermore if the edges are prevented from
moving in the plane by a pin or clamped support then tensile stresses can be built up as the plate deforms
in the z direction as moderate to large buckling deformation increases. As outlined in Yang et al. [36], one-
dimensional wrinkles can be induced in nanomaterials by pre-stretching the substrate and then depositing
the material of interest on it. When the tensile force is released this results in a compression acting in one
direction. Forces can then be applied in an orthogonal direction to induce further changes to the material.

In this study we will limit investigation to the case when, say, Py is held constant and Px is parametrically
varied. Physically this is equivalent to preloading the plate in one direction (not necessarily up to the
buckling capacity in that direction) and then applying another load in the orthogonal direction.

2.2 Total potential energy and Euler–Lagrange equations

We shall use the energy of the system as a measure of the various buckled states. The total potential energy

The ﬁrst three lines of integrals represents the energy stored in the bending of the plate and includes nonlinear
contributions arising from moderate to large deformations. The fourth line denotes the work done by the
two loading parameters Px and Py and we identify the end-shortening of the plate in the x and y directions

respectively. The ﬁnal line of integrals in (2.8) gives the energy stored in the elastic foundation.

Of course, the governing equations are obtainable from V by obtaining the associated Euler–Lagrange equa-
tions of the system but the energy itself plays an important role in the preferential formation of certain
buckle patterns.

2.3 Linearization

To understand the critical behaviour of the system it is necessary to linearize (2.6)-(2.7) about the trivial
state. We will ﬁrst look at the critical instability of an inﬁnite plate so that boundary conditions can be
safely ignored. In order to simplify the subsequent notation let us put Px = P and Py = αP for where the
parameter α can theoretically be any real value. However, without loss of generality, if we consider a plate
that is longer in the x-direction than in the y then buckling will be dictated by Px and so we can legitimately
restrict our interest to |α| ≤ 1. If we then seek Fourier mode solutions

of the linearization of (2.6)-(2.7) about the trivial state, this gives

w(x, y) = AeΛxeiπy,

(Λ − π)2(Λ + π)2 + (Λ2 − απ2)P + 1 = 0,

(cid:112)±√

with solutions

Λ = ±

√

S ≡ P 2 − 4π2P (1 − α) − 4.

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

√

A bifurcation occurs when S becomes negative and this then corresponds to x-spatially periodic modes.
When P < P C the eigenvalues are complex-valued with the critical values P C = 2 when α = 1 and
P C = 2π2 +
π4 + 1 when α = 0; in contrast when P > P C two of the eigenvalues are complex but the
other two real. Of course we should also linearize equation (2.7) but as the result is independent of P it has
no bearing on the bifurcation behaviour of the system with respect to load.

3 A Galerkin analysis

To obtain numerical solutions and then investigate their evolution under varying parameters it is necessary to
derive an initial approximate two-dimensional solution to the system. Once a successful solution is obtained,
we can employ numerical continuation to change Py to the desired value.

We utilize a straightforward Galerkin procedure [33] for this purpose and start with a purely periodic response
of the form

w = Aψ(x, y)

(3.1)

where A is a constant amplitude and ψ is an appropriate shape function. The initial stress function, φ, can be
approximated either as a multiple of w or as zero if we are seeking to start from close to the bifurcation from
the trivial state. We set the length of the plate in the x direction to be L = π and impose Neumann boundary
conditions in that direction. If the width γ = 2, then for clamped boundary conditions in the y-direction,
at y = ±1, we need to identify an appropriate set of functions that satisfy w(x,±1) = wy(x,±1) = 0. In
the x-direction we assume Neumann boundary conditions, i.e., wx(0, y) = wx(π, y) = 0 and, furthermore, if
w(0, y) = w(π, y) then we have periodic boundaries in that direction. A suitable family of even functions
obeying these boundary conditions is given by

ψ(x, y) = cos mx((−1)n+1 + cos nπy)

(3.2)

where m and n are integers which characterize the number of half waves occuring in the x and y directions,
respectively and a periodic boundary condition in the x-direction requires m to be even. A counterpart odd
set of functions in the y direction are given by

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

ψ(x, y) = cos mπx

sin nπy +

n

n + 1

sin(n + 1)πy

and in order to satisfy periodic boundary conditions in the x direction, m should be even. If we denote the
left-hand side of the ﬁrst equation (2.6) by Q(x, y) and feed in the assumed form for w in (3.1) then the

Galerkin formulation tells us that (cid:90) y=1

(cid:90) x=π

y=−1

x=0

Q(x, y)ψ(x, y) dx dy = 0

which leads to a cubic equation in A with a non-trivial even solution

(cid:113)

A = ± 4√

105k3

3m2Px + π2n2Py − (3m4 + 2π2m2n2 + π4n4 + 3).

Note the presence of the cubic coeﬃcient k3 but the absence of the quadratic coeﬃcient k2. This feature is
a consequence of taking a single term for the shape of w and leads to a symmetric from for A. For greater
accuracy we could use more terms but since the motivation for this Galerkin method is simply to supply
some initial functions that can be used to generate full numerical solutions close to the trivial one, there is
little to be gained by deriving a more accurate initial state. For real values of A the term inside the square
root must be greater than zero and this gives us a critical value for Px = P C

x , say, if Py is held constant.

4 Transverse instability of quasi-1D states

We next examine the possibility of a transverse instability of quasi-1D states (by which we mean one-
dimensional states that are trivially extended to two-spatial dimensions). We will subsequently ﬁnd that the
transverse instability of quasi-1D states play a pivotal role for the emergence of non-trivial 2D states.

7

We start by seeking solutions that vary only in the transverse direction y. If W (y, t) is a one-dimensional
solution of (2.6) and if Φ(y) satisﬁes (2.7) then it is immediately apparent that

Wtt + Wyyyy + PyWyy + f (W ) = 0,
d4
yΦ = 0.

(4.1)

(4.2)

In such state, as there is no variation in x, the end-shortening component ∆x = 0 and the stress function
Φ ≡ 0 everywhere. It is well known that stationary solutions of (4.1), W (y, t) = W (y), exist; see, for instance,
see [24]. The linear stability properties of the stationary W (y) with respect to perturbations in y can be
inferred directly from results of the ubiquitous SH equation (given by (4.1) save that the Wtt is replaced
by Wt). In particular, if a periodic orbit is linearly stable in the standard SH equation, then it is neutrally
stable in (4.1). Hence, there do exist periodic orbits that are linearly stable with respect to perturbations in
the y-direction.

We next consider a small transverse perturbation in the x-direction by letting w(x, y, t) = W (y) + ˆw(x, y, t)
and φ(x, y, t) = ˆφ(x, y, t), where ˆw and ˆφ are both small. Substituting these forms in (2.6) and (2.7) and
linearizing we ﬁnd

ˆwtt + ∇4 ˆw − ( ˆφxx Wyy) + Px ˆwxx + Py ˆwyy + f

(cid:48)

(W ) ˆw = 0,
∇4 ˆφ + ˆwxxWyy = 0.

We look for periodic perturbations in the x-direction so that

ˆw, ˆφ

where c.c. denotes the complex conjugate, it follows that ˆv satisﬁes the ODE eigenvalue problem

in which the operators are

η2ˆv + L1(ˆv) + β2 ˆψWyy + β4ˆv − 2β2ˆvyy − β2Pxˆv = 0
L2( ˆψ) − 2β2 ˆψyy + β4 ˆψ − β2ˆvWyy = 0

L1(ˆv) := ˆvyyyy + Py ˆvyy + f

(cid:48)

(W )ˆv, L2( ˆψ) := ˆψyyyy.

We solve the spectral problem (4.6) for η = η(β). For small β we write

(4.6)

(4.7)

(4.8)

(η, ˆv, ˆψ) = (0, ˆv0(y), 0) + β(η1, ˆv1(y), ˆψ1(y)) + β2(η2, ˆv2(y), ˆψ2(y)) + ···

(4.9)
and at the zeroth and ﬁrst orders it follows that ˆv0 = Wy and L1(ˆv1) = L2( ˆψ1) = 0 so that ˆv1 ≡ 0 and
ˆψ1 ≡ 0.
At O(β2), we have

L1(ˆv2) = 2ˆv0,yy + Pxˆv0 − η2

L2( ˆψ2) = ˆv0 Wyy.

A standard application of the method of adjoints leads to the conclusion that this system only admits an
acceptable solution if

(4.12)

This criterion for transverse instability replicates that for the standard SH equation [15]. In particular, it is
known that 1D periodic orbits minimise their energy with respect to variation in their wavelength.

(d) fourth-mode, P C = 59.71.

We now have a procedure to predict the dynamical stability of patterns, at least when they start as functions
of y alone. We therefore need to obtain solutions, W (y), of the ODE (4.1), subject to appropriate boundary
conditions (clamped in this case). Solutions can readily be obtained using Auto [12] and the quantities N1
and N2 used to evaluate the transverse instability criterion (4.12). We compute the ﬁrst four modes of (4.1)
on a ﬁnite domain in y satisfying the boundary conditions (2.3) and the results are shown in Figure 2.

We show in Figure 3 a two-parameter plot of the transverse (in)stability region when k2 = 2 and k3 = 0.5.
In this ﬁgure the values of N1 and N2 (see (4.11)) have been calculated numerically for a one-dimentional
pattern and the boundary where the value of η2
1 becomes positive (4.12) is shown. It indicates the value of
Px above which the solutions become unstable in time. We see that the location of the lower boundary for
Py is almost independent of Px; indeed when Py (cid:47) 9.7, the ﬁrst-mode no longer exists and bifurcates from
the ﬂat state. We infer from this result that the striped (one-dimensional) solution remains stable until Px
is pushed beyond some ctitical value, after which it becomes unstable and the pattern evolves to some other
state.

A word of caution is appropriate here. Our analysis described here is strictly only valid for a plate of inﬁnite
extent in the x-direction. Thus it is unlikely to provide a complete picture of the stability of plates of ﬁnite
length for which the choice of boundary conditions ought to be relevant. That said, the analysis should
provide some clue as to the types of behaviours that may be seen when a striped solution of a ﬁnite plate
(with deﬂection independent of x) encounters a perturbation which varies in the transverse planar direction.

The above approximations allow us to speculate on the form of some of the possibilities of solution of
the plate-on-foundation model. However, given the experience gained with related problems, such as the

(1D) strut model [32], it is highly probable that there is an intricate solution structure which, initially at
least, can best be explored numerically. This was done by discretising the boundary value problem using
a standard fourth order scheme in the x-direction and then imposing Neumann boundary conditions using
ghost points [26]. A pseudo-spectral Chebyshev discretisation was employed in the y-direction with the
clamped boundary conditions enforced by choosing the polynomial interpolant, p(y), of a function in y to
be p(y) = (1 − y2)q(y) where q(y) is a polynomial with q(±1) = 0; see Trefethen [30, Chapter 14]. The
two-dimensional diﬀerentation operators were constructed using Kronecker products as described in [30] and
the boundary value problem solved using a Newton trust region based algorithm [10]. We also embedded the
boundary value problem into a secant continuation formulation to facilitate path following of the solutions
in parameter space [21].
The scheme was implemented in Matlab (version 2015a) with typical discretizations in x of Nx = 41 mesh
points on x ∈ [0, π] and Ny = 21 Chebyshev collocation points in y.

5.1 Periodic solutions

As mentioned earlier, it is frequently the case that for plate problems focus is concentrated on periodic
behaviour particularly in the macroscopic example of engineering structures. In such instances the wavelength
of the buckle pattern is of the same order of magnitude as the overall dimensions of the plates so only a
relatively small number of waves are expected to span the whole domain. The aspect ratio is also important;
a plate that is very much thinner in one dimension than the other might conceivably behave somewhat like
a strut [34] but wider plates may well exhibit very diﬀerent behaviour. We take some tentative numerical
steps towards investigating this variation in §55.3.
The earlier Galerkin analysis suggested that solutions which are periodic both in x and y can bifurcate
from the trivial ﬂat state and they do so in pairs. However we now appreciate a limitation of the simple-
minded Galerkin approximation used above because it is evident that, since the foundation is asymmetric
with respect to deﬂection the pair of modes that evolve are not mirror images of each other.
In order

symmetry [16]. Nevertheless, the single-mode approach gives us a ﬁrm connection between the one- and
two-dimensional studies. A typical example of the periodic post-buckling regime is depicted in Figure 4.
Here the two branches emerging from the ﬂat state are labelled A and B and shown in diﬀerent colours. In
P -∆x space both branches overlap exactly and it is therefore more informative to present the plot with one
extra dimension (here, deﬂection at the origin) to prise the two branches apart and show that they really are
distinct. The buckled shape corresponds to m = 3, n = 1 as deﬁned in (3.2). With Py = 2, the prediction
from the 1D approach in §4 is that at bifurcation Px ≈ 17.03 (see (4.12)) while the numerical solution of the
full equation reveals that the bifurcation occurs at around Px = 22.7. Each point on the curve is a solution
of the static equilibrium equations although the energy V does vary considerably. The value of the energy
can be loosely thought of as an informal relative measure of how distorted the deﬂected surface is, starting
at zero at the bifurcation point (Bif) and dropping oﬀ as the striped solution is approached (St) (although
as the striped solution is obviously not ﬂat, the value of the energy is not zero).

foundation model under in-plane forces with k2 = 2 and k3 = 0.5. The plate has length L = π and the transverse
load, Py, is held constant at 2. The two branches are denoted A in blue (thick line), and B in red (thin line). (b) In
Px-V space the two branches are congruent and solutions corresponding to individual points identiﬁed on each branch
are shown in Figures 5 and 6.

Some solutions at various values of Px are shown in Figures 5 and 6.
In Figure 5(a) we see the buckle
pattern, which emerges from the ﬂat state w = 0. Of course, this solution relates to just one side of the
bifurcation point as a second pattern, which is not quite the mirror image of the ﬁrst, evolves on the other
branch. Figures 5(b) and (c) depict solutions further into the post-buckling regime and it is much easier to
see that these solutions are asymmetric about the ﬂat state owing to the bias in the foundation introduced
by the quadratic term.

Solutions on each branch continue to maintain the same structure as Px is varied except that the amplitudes
of both the peaks and troughs increase steadily until the branches near the striped solution St which is
shown in Figure 6. This last state corresponds to the situation when the two branches eventually coalesce
thus forming a closed bifurcation curve (isola) on which the solution appears to be trapped.

5.1.1 Striped solution
It is evident that a special example of a periodic solution is that discussed in §4 where the deﬂection is
purely a function of y. The solution has been shown to be stable to a two-dimensional perturbation only if
the axial load Px lies within a certain range. Our computations above indicate that the solution represents a
transition from solutions of one parity to another. The numerical results also conﬁrm that ∆x is zero both at
the bifurcation from the trivial state and at the striped state (see Figure 4(a)). A very important distinction
between these two limiting conﬁgurations is that the potential energy is quite diﬀerent— see Figure 4(b).
The upshot is that the two states are not interchangeable and a straightforward transition from one to the
other is impossible.

For the same value of Py (= 2), two further families of solutions can be found that both bifurcate from the
fundamental state but which do so at diﬀerent values of Px (see Figures 7). The emerging solutions are
distinct, having a diﬀerent number of waves in the y direction but, as these solutions evolve, they converge
to the same striped solution presented earlier. Though kinematically similar, it should be remembered that
Px is diﬀerent in the two instances although the ﬁnal striped solution has potential energy V ≈ 14.649
(equation (2.8)). The potential energy of the striped solution is lower than other equilibrium states in
the vicinity which satisﬁes the axiom for static stability [28] and numerically agrees with our analysis of
dynamical stability in §4 that such solutions should be statically stable.
Two further bifurcation diagrams are presented for a diﬀerent value of transverse load: Py = 7 (see Figure 8).
It can be seen once more that although the solutions emergent from the trivial state have separate forms,
they again coalesce onto the same striped solution. In this case, V ≈ 73.821.

5.1.2 Transverse stability of the striped solutions

It is evident that the same striped solution exists at the limit point of several solutions bifurcating from
the ﬂat state (e.g. Figures 6(e) and 7(c) where three distinct two-dimensional bifurcating patterns share the
same striped pattern or Figure 8(c) for two others for a diﬀerent value of Py). The form of these sets of
one-dimensional solutions are dictated solely by the value of the load parameter Py only because the end
shortening in the x direction, ∆x, is zero and so there is no contribution to the potential energy from Px.
On the other hand the form of the solutions emerging from the trivial state is dependent on both Px and
Py. So, the question that inevitably arises is: how can the same striped solution be linked to multiple
two-dimensionally periodic forms? The answer is guided both by the approximate analysis carried out in §4
and the numerical simulations.

Theoretical analysis reveals that the striped solution remains dynamically stable as long as

Px <

2N 2
2
N 2
1

.

(5.1)

If Px is larger than this limit then η1 (4.12) is real and the solution will grow exponentially in time. The
striped solution under consideration closely resembles mode 1 in Figure 2 and it is determined that the
critical value of Px ≈ 19.7. This compares reasonably well with the numerically computed limit values of N1
and N2 for the full equations which lead to the prediction Px ≈ 22.7.
By numerically ﬁnding the striped solution for various value of Px, bifurcations can be detected by numerically
estimating when an eigenvalue of the approximate solution becomes zero. The structure of the eigensolution
closely resembles the deﬂection pattern in the vicinity of critical buckling and a bifurcation is detected
at around Px = 10.17. The unstable eigensolution at this load is plotted in Figure 9(a) and it can be
seen that although the actual deﬂected shape is one dimensional, the eigensolution reveals the direction in
which any disturbance would grow. Thus we conclude that in the vicinity of this load, the solution would
naturally evolve towards a pattern indicated by that unstable solution. Further transverse instabilities can
be detected at various values of Px (while holding Py constant) and some are shown in Figure 9 (b) and (c).
These unstable eigensolutions resemble the buckle patterns in Figures 7. The numerically determined values
of Px correlate very well with the values at the limit points of the bifurcation curves. Thus we conclude that
the same striped pattern can indeed be linked to various two-dimensional patterns in a systematic way.

We have found that for each given Py, there is an associated striped solution. However, we can subsequently
induce buckle patterns of diﬀerent types by then loading the plate in the orthogonal direction, Px. The-
oretically, this could be used as a way of producing desired deﬂection pattern in a repeatable manner. A
consequence of the phenomenon of multiple patterns being able to develop from a particular 1D striped

16

⇡0-1 1xy⇡0-1 1xy⇡0-1 1xy(a)(b)(c)Px/⇡2=40.11Px/⇡2=9.52Px/⇡2=1.03mode could be used to manufacture a layer of material with a desired pattern in a two-step process. Firstly,
the specimen could be loaded in one in-plane direction to give a striped buckle shape and then judicious
loading in the orthogonal direction would then give rise to the required 2D pattern. In particular, carefully
varying the secondary load would, in principle, be a possible method of manufacturing materials with various
tuneable patterns and hence physical properties [36].

5.2 Localized behaviour

As we indicated in the previous section, periodicity is the predominant form of behaviour to be expected in
most plated structures since the ﬁnite domain precludes genuinely localized solutions which are only evident
over an inﬁnite domain. However, if the domain is signiﬁcantly larger than the natural wavelength of the
buckle pattern then a (periodic) solution can arise which comes to resemble its truly localized counterpart
in the sense that over the whole extent of the plate, only a small fraction undergoes noticeable deﬂection.
Localization of patterns can be favourable under certain conditions, particularly where a softening nonlin-
earity makes such a pattern energetically more favourable to jump to than its periodic counterpart [16] even
though both are kinematically admissible. Even in the case that such localized solutions are unstable, they
can form critical (mountain pass) modes [14] to other forms. Thus a localized solution may develop in a
structure of ﬁnite extent if at one end the solution and all its derivatives approach zero. Such is the case for
the buckling of a thin cylindrical shell [18]. In other applications, such as contemporary material science,
periodic buckling has been the primary focus [37]. However, if the extent of the domain is much larger than
the wavelength of buckle patterns then isolated (localized) patterns can coexist with periodic solutions.

To demonstrate the relationship between periodic and localized forms, Figure 10 shows the bifurcation
structure of two plates of non-dimensional lengths 10 and 20. These plots can be interpreted as a localized
patterns with symmetry about the postion x = 0. As can be seen, a pair of solutions bifurcate from the trivial
(zero-energy) state, the other is a subsidiary solution forming a multi-humped pattern [32]. We infer that as
length increases the limiting behaviour will be localized states that bifurcate from the unbuckled state and
co-exist with their periodic counterparts just as in the one-dimensional strut model [16]. For a ﬁnite-length
plate, the way in which a localized pattern may be realized is by an initial periodic pattern which is then
disturbed, perhaps by a secondary bifurcation, into a localized state. Such multi-staged buckling phenomena
are common in plates [17, 19].

5.3 Aspect ratio

The problem as formulated in this study consists of an investigation into the theoretical buckling aspects
of a structure that extends into two dimensions. The equivalent one-dimensional problem (the strut model)
has been extensively studied but the plate on a foundation has attracted far less interest. There are many
potential avenues to explore for this model and we have hinted at some possible ideas here. In many ways, it
is perhaps the role played by the aspect ratio that is perhaps most fundamental so we introduce the aspect
ratio, ly ≡ γ/L, as a continuous parameter.
In Figure 11 we illustrate the evolution of a basic periodic
solution as ly is varied from its original value l0 = 2/π. As the ratio is increased so the pattern spreads to
ﬁll the extra width and yet the buckled cells approximately maintain their own aspect ratio. As the width
gets larger, there are a few transitions when the number of cells increases by one each time; this is clearly a
form of mode jumping [13]. Further evidence that lends credence to this conclusion is provided in the plot
of potential energy versus ly as the curve exhibits undulations at the point where the number of buckle cells
changes.

The current work has examined the fundamental behaviour of a structural system in order to investigate
the eﬀect of adding an extra spatial dimension to a well-studied one-dimensional problem. As expected, the
introduction of a ﬁnite width opens up a new richness of possibilities of solutions available after buckling
ensues. The loading regime is seen to be enhanced with the ability to apply diﬀerent forces in diﬀerent
directions and indeed to allow the loading to vary spatially, although that has been left for future work.

We have seen that some conventional techniques, such as the Galerkin method, are able approximately to
capture buckling behaviour emergent from the ﬂat state but fully numerical methods are needed to follow
what happens to these solutions further into post-buckling. We found that there are special one-dimensional
(striped) patterns which eventually connect both the branches which emerge from the critical state and
furthermore that the same striped pattern (governed by the transverse load, Py) can lie at the end of multiple
branches. The unstable eigensolutions of the striped solution reveal which two-dimensional (spot) solution it
links to. An interesting possibility arises from our ﬁndings in that we have outlined a plausible procedure by
which material could be manufactured with pre-determined characteristics by careful application of load in
one in-plane direction followed by loading at right angles to it. This technique could be a simpler alternative
to current methods used to manufacture highly-tuned nanomaterials.

A straightforward analysis of the striped solution using an adaptation of the strut model [34] reveals infor-
mation about the stability of solutions and this, coupled to numerics, has enabled us to locate the boundary
between stable and unstable behaviour. The boundary gives a reasonable approximation for the longitudinal
load at which the striped solution gives way to spots or cellular buckle patterns.

Although we have considered the loading as two independent parameters this study, it may be instructive in
future to allow the load to vary along either or both edges in order to simulate various conditions that may
arise in reality. An example of such varying stress may arise through thermal expansion or contraction of
a plate embedded in an elastic medium. Some consideration has been given to localized behaviour and the
eﬀects of aspect ratio. These features would increase in importance were we to look at the case where the
buckling cells are small compared with the length and width of the plate.

The plate–foundation model has been used to mimic many physical situations ranging from material wrinkling
in industrial manufacturing [11], theoretical neo-Hookian materials [5] and fold hierarchies in thin ﬁlms [25]
through to the morphological development of tissue and organs such as the brain [4]. However, most modelling
usually starts with some simplifying assumptions including the reduction of the problem into one-dimensional
phenomena. We oﬀer here a way to begin systematically to study two-dimensional behaviour which holds
the possibility of uncovering a much richer set of competing and interacting solutions. Although resolution
is presently far oﬀ, progress in this direction may conceivably go some way to explain some of the complex
behaviour observed in practice.
