ABSTRACT

Context. In the last few years, the outskirts of galaxy clusters have been studied in detail and the analyses brought up interesting results
such as e.g. indications for possible gas clumping and breakdown of hydrostatic, thermal, and ionization equilibrium. These eﬀects
aﬀect the entropy proﬁles of clusters which often show deviations from the self-similar prediction around R200. However, signiﬁcant
uncertainties remain for groups of galaxies. In particular the question, if entropy proﬁles are similar to the ones of galaxy clusters.
Aims. We investigated the gas properties of the galaxy group UGC03957 up to 1.4 R200 ≈ 1.4 Mpc in four azimuthal directions with
the Suzaku satellite. We checked for azimuthal symmetry and obtained temperature, entropy, density and gas mass proﬁles. Previous
studies point to deviations from equilibrium states at the outskirts of groups and clusters, thus, we studied the hydrodynamical status
of the gas at these large radii.
Methods. We performed a spectral analysis of ﬁve Suzaku observations of UGC03957 with ∼138 ks good exposure time in total as
well as ﬁve Chandra snapshot observations for point source detection. We investigated systematic eﬀects such as point-spread-function
eﬀects and uncertainties in the diﬀerent background components and performed a deprojection of the density and temperature proﬁle.
Results. We found a temperature drop of a factor of ∼3 from the center to the outskirts which is consistent with previous results
for galaxy clusters. The metal abundance proﬁle shows a ﬂat behavior towards large radii which is a hint for galactic winds as the
primary ICM enrichment process. The entropy proﬁle is consistent with numerical simulations after applying a gas mass fraction
correction. Feedback processes and AGN activity might be one explanation for entropy modiﬁcation, imprinting out to larger radii in
galaxy groups compared to galaxy clusters. Previous analyses for clusters and groups often showed an entropy ﬂattening or even a
drop around ∼R200 which can be an indicator for clumping or non-equilibrium states in the outskirts. Such entropy behaviour is absent
in UGC03957. The gas mass fraction is well below the cosmic mean but rises above this value beyond R200 which could be a hint for
deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium at these large radii. By measuring the abundance of the α-elements Si and S at intermediate
radii we determined the relative number of diﬀerent supernovae types and found that the abundance pattern can be described by a
relative contribution of 80% – 100% of core-collapse supernovae. These results are in agreement with previous measurements for
galaxy groups.

1. Introduction

The outskirts of galaxy clusters, and in particular galaxy groups,
still remain unexplored to a large extent. X-ray studies are the
best tool to investigate temperature and metallicity of the hot gas
component in these objects which accounts for ∼90% of the total
baryon content. In the past years, several analyses investigating
the outskirts were performed (e.g. Sato et al. 2014, a review see
Reiprich et al. 2013). Though, most of them are dealing with
properties of galaxy clusters and a clear lack of detailed anal-
yses at the low mass end exists. These analyses brought up in-
teresting results as for example possible non-equilibrium states
(e.g. Hoshino et al. 2010, Akamatsu et al. 2011, Akamatsu et al.
2012) or gas clumping (Simionescu et al. 2011) due to the in-
falling material from the large scale structure around the virial
radius. But understanding these eﬀects and their interplay in de-
tail is an open task and especially galaxy groups can give impor-
tant insights. In these objects the non-gravitational processes are
expected to be more important due to the shallower gravitational
potential well. In a self-similar picture of the cluster formation
process, galaxy groups should behave as scaled down versions of
galaxy clusters regarding e.g. temperature, density and entropy

proﬁle. In particular the entropy proﬁle is an important indica-
tor of the hydrodynamical status of the gas. However, for galaxy
clusters several previous studies as e.g. Ichikawa et al. (2013),
Walker et al. (2012a) and Walker et al. (2012b) found a ﬂatten-
ing or even a drop of the entropy proﬁle at large radii compared
to the expectation from numerical simulations of the gravita-
tional collapse formation model performed by Voit (2005). This
behavior may e.g. indicate a breakdown of thermal equilibrium
between electrons and protons (e.g. Akamatsu et al. 2011) or in-
homogeneous gas distributions in the outskirts; the latter is also
supported by simulations performed by Nagai & Lau (2011). A
study of a galaxy group by Su et al. (2013) also found an entropy
drop, whereas Humphrey et al. (2012) obtained an entropy pro-
ﬁle for a fossil group in agreement with the simulations by Voit
(2005). Other studies of entropy proﬁles for clusters and groups
have e.g. been performed by Chaudhuri et al. (2012) and Su
et al. (2015) yielding diﬀerent behaviors of the entropy proﬁles
at large radii. Therefore, the question remains if galaxy groups
behave in a self-similar way compared to galaxy clusters regard-
ing e.g. the entropy proﬁle.

Self-similarity is an important assumption when dealing with
scaling relations, in particular at the low mass end of galaxy

(2008), Komiyama et al. (2009) and Simionescu et al. (2009).
The heavy elements which can be found in the ICM are thrown
out by supernova explosions into the surrounding medium. This
material is then distributed to the ICM, mainly by galactic winds
and ram pressure stripping. As e.g. simulated by Kapferer et al.
(2007), clusters primarily enriched by ram-pressure stripping
show a steeper abundance proﬁle than clusters where the enrich-
ment is dominated by galactic winds, i.e. ram-pressure stripping
acts more eﬃcient in the dense cluster centers whereas galctic
winds are present at all radii. But not only the radial proﬁle is
important, the ratio of diﬀerent elements contains information
about the past, too. The ratio of alpha-elements to iron abun-
dances gives information about the amount of Supernovae Type
Ia (SNIa) compared to core-collapse supernovae (SNCC) events
in the past (e.g. Mernier et al. 2015, Simionescu et al. 2015a,
Lovisari et al. 2011). This ratio can be computed for diﬀerent
supernovae yield models and in principle allows to distinguish
between those models (e.g. Sato et al. 2007a).

Measuring all the mentioned proﬁles and properties of clus-
ters and in particular of galaxy groups is challenging as the sur-
face brightness (SB) drops fast towards the outskirts and there-
fore the treatment of the background emission is crucial. The
Suzaku satellite is of special importance for these kind of analy-
ses because of its low and stable instrumental background due to
its low earth orbit and short focal length. Here we present an X-
ray analysis of the galaxy group UGC03957 with Suzaku reach-
ing 1.4R200, where R200 = 23.7(cid:48) is obtained from the Suzaku
data in this work (see Sec. 5.5). We measure temperature, metal-
licity, density, entropy, surface brightness and gas mass fraction
proﬁles up to and beyond R200 as well as the entropy proﬁle.
In addition we investigate the ratio of SNIa to SNCC from the
abundance pattern of α-elements in the center and compare dif-
ferent SNIa yield models. Throughout the analyses we assume
a ﬂat universe with H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1 and ΩΛ = 0.73. All
errors are given at 68% conﬁdence level.

2. Observations and Data Reduction

2.1. Suzaku

The galaxy group UGC03957 is one of the most luminous local
groups with a redshift of z = 0.034. We analyze ﬁve Suzaku ob-
servations performed with the XIS instrument aboard of Suzaku
with 138 ks total cleaned exposure time (cf. Tab. 1). One short
archival observation (analyzed as part of a sample in Shang &
Scharf 2009) is pointing towards the center of the group while
we placed four additional deeper observations in each azimuthal
direction around the center (called North, East, South and West
observation in the following) as shown in Fig. 1. These obser-
vations are very well suited to study possible azimuthal devia-
tions in the outskirts, each of the four reaching beyond R200. The
central Suzaku observation was taken in 2006, while the other
four were performed in March 2012. XIS2 was damaged due to
a micrometeorite hit in November 2006, therefore, only XIS0,
XIS1 and XIS3 data can be used for the analyses of the outer
observations while data of all four XIS chips is available for the
central observation. Further details are listed in Tab. 1. A ﬁrst
estimate for the radius R200 where the gas density is 200 times
the critical density of the universe was determined using Rosat
All-Sky-Survey (RASS) data (Reiprich & B¨ohringer 2002). This
yields a value of R200 = 34.06(cid:48) which is also the maximum ra-
dius we reach with our observations. We determine R200 using
Suzaku data in Sec. 5.5.

central observation was performed in 2006; the outer observa-
tions (North, East, South and West) are from 2012. For observa-
tion details see Tab. 1. Light blue solid regions correspond to 0(cid:48) –
2(cid:48),2(cid:48) – 4(cid:48),4(cid:48) – 7(cid:48) and 7(cid:48) – 11(cid:48) (labeled from one to four outwards
in the following), white dashed regions to 14(cid:48) – 25(cid:48) and 25(cid:48) – 34(cid:48)
(labeled ﬁve and six in the following). All removed point sources
detected with Chandra are indicated by green circles. The image
is not corrected for vignetting and only used for demonstration
purposes.

groups. As measured by e.g. Eckmiller et al. (2011) and Lovisari
et al. (2015) scaling relations often show deviations from the
self-similar prediction in this regime. However, the scatter is still
large and more detailed studies are required out to the virial ra-
dius to avoid biases due to the extrapolation of the measured pro-
ﬁles. E.g. Maughan et al. (2012) studied the LX - T relation for
114 clusters. They combined their cluster sample with the cool
core cluster sample of Pratt et al. (2009) to reach the low mass
regime and temperatures <3.5 keV. In this regime they found a
strong deviation from the self-similar prediction. One possibility
for a deviating process in clusters and groups is AGN feedback
(e.g. Bharadwaj et al. 2014). AGN heating might have a sig-
niﬁcant impact at larger radii in galaxy groups than in galaxy
clusters because of their lower mass which leads to further ex-
pansion of the heated gas. Other non-gravitational processes as
e.g. galactic winds or star formation can also play a signiﬁcant
role in low mass systems while they should be less important in
galaxy clusters. E.g. Eckert et al. (2013b) investigated the aver-
age entropy proﬁle of 18 galaxy clusters conﬁrming an entropy
excess at smaller radii and a better agreement with the numer-
ical simulations further out. This entropy excess suggests that
non-gravitational eﬀects such as feedback from the central AGN
or preheating processes are present in the intracluster medium
(ICM).

Another aspect of the evolution of galaxy clusters and groups
is the chemical enrichment history. Measuring the abundance
and especially individual abundances of α-elements can give
important insights in chemical evolution of the ICM. This has
been done previously by e.g. Tamura et al. (2004), de Plaa et al.

The data reduction was performed using CALDB version
20150105 and followed the standard reduction procedure as de-
scribed in the Suzaku data reduction guide. This includes the
tasks: xiscoord to calculate event coordinates, xisputpixelqual-
ity to assign the quality code to each event (e.g. falls in bad
pixel), xispi to calculate pulse invariant values using gain- and
charge-transfer-ineﬃciency correction, xistime to assign correct
arrival times and cleansis to identify anomalous pixels. The re-
quirement on the geomagnetic cutoﬀ rigidity is COR2>6 and we
removed events falling in the second trailing rows of the charge
injection rows. We selected six annular regions around the cen-
ter as shown in Fig. 1; the four inner regions (0(cid:48) – 2(cid:48), 2(cid:48) – 4(cid:48), 4(cid:48) –
7(cid:48) and 7(cid:48) – 11(cid:48)) covering the central Suzaku observation and the
two outer regions (14(cid:48) – 25(cid:48) and 25(cid:48) – 34(cid:48)) covering the four ob-
servations of the outskirts. Due to the long time period between
the central and the outskirts observations of almost six years, the
central observation was analyzed separately from the four outer
observations.

To investigate the impact of ﬂares during the observations
which may be caused by high solar-wind-charge-exchange emis-
sion, we checked the solar proton ﬂux using SWEPAM/SWICS
Level 3 data1. This data includes measurements of the proton
speed and proton density from both instruments, but SWEPAM
data is preferentially used due to the higher quality and only
gaps in this data set are ﬁlled with SWICS data. For slow so-

lar winds SWEPAM may underestimate the proton ﬂux and
SWICS data is used instead. The measured ﬂuxes for all point-
ings are shown in Fig. 2. The travel time of the solar protons to
Earth was considered. We found a very low proton ﬂux during
the time period of the central observation so that the impact of
ﬂares for this observation is negligible. During the observation
time period of the outskirts, the proton ﬂux is higher and in the
case for the East, South and West observation reaches the limit
of ∼4 × 108 cm−2 s−1 as it was determined by Fujimoto et al.
(2007) which can lead to ﬂare contamination of the lightcurves.
Therefore, we applied a three-sigma clipping to the lightcurves
for all outer observations and ﬁltered the corresponding time in-
tervals.

2.2. Chandra
In 2013 and 2014, we obtained four supporting Chandra snap-
shot observations of ∼10 ks exposure each to detect point
sources in the North, East, South and West Suzaku pointings. For
point source detection in the central observation we used archival
Chandra data from 2006 of ∼8 ks exposure. The Chandra data re-
duction has been performed using the CIAO software (CIAO 4.5,
CALDB 4.6.7). The data have been reprocessed from the level 1
events ﬁles using the contributed script chandra repro. Periods
of high background have been cleaned by creating a lightcurve
with the suggested values from Markevitchs Cookbook2 and
the lc clean algorithm. Point sources were identiﬁed using the
wavdetect algorithm using a range of wavelet radii between 1
and 16 pixels to ensure all point sources were detected.

3. Analysis
3.1. Point Sources
To identify point sources in the ﬁeld of view (FOV) we analyzed
ﬁve Chandra snapshot observations matching the ﬁve Suzaku

pointings. The chosen ﬂux limit to remove point sources should
be: 1. independent of statistical ﬂuctuations in the source counts
and 2. a compromise between the removed area and accurate
treatment of the point sources. Therefore, we made a cumulative
log N-log F plot with N being the number of sources above or
equal to a given ﬂux F as shown in Fig. 3. When the detection
limit of the instrument is reached no more sources are expected
to be detected which results in a ﬂattening of the distribution to-
wards lower ﬂuxes as it is the case for 7× 10−14 erg s−1 cm−2. All
sources brighter than this limit in the 0.5−2 keV band, assuming
a power-law model with spectral index 2, were removed using a
circular region of radius 1(cid:48) around the point source. In Fig. 1 all
removed point sources are shown.

3.2. Response ﬁles
In a ﬁrst step, the ancillary response ﬁles (ARF) were cre-
ated using a double-beta model surface brightness image of the
galaxy group as it was determined using XMM-Newton data
(Lovisari et al. 2015) and later iterated using the Suzaku re-
sults together with XMM-Newton data. The proﬁle obtained
with XMM-Newton was extrapolated to reach the outskirts of
the group. The impact of the input image for the ARF genera-
tion on the ﬁt results was investigated and is discussed in Sec. 4.
To ensure suﬃcient statistics and to save computation time, each
observation has its own input image which is simply a cut out
region of the large modeled SB image. This is illustrated in Fig.
4 where the ﬁve cut out regions around the central position of
each pointing are shown. The regions are chosen larger than the
FOV to account for stray light reaching the detector from outside
the FOV. The eﬀect of stray light from the galaxy group center
can be neglected as described in Sec. 3.3.

It has to be taken into account that the normalizations and
ﬂuxes obtained in the ﬁtting process assume emission from the
whole input image (cf. Ishisaki et al. 2007). Therefore, when
comparing or linking normalizations of diﬀerent observations
during the ﬁtting process, these have to be rescaled according
to the ratio of counts in the corresponding input images used for
ARF generation. Also, if one assumes that the emission spec-
trum is identical over the whole sky and only the normalization
decreases as a function of increasing radius, the XSPEC nor-

malization and ﬂux for each ﬁtted annulus should give the same
value as they are rescaled to refer to the whole input image (cf.
Ishisaki et al. 2007). However, this assumption does not hold in
reality. The ﬂux is a function of temperature and metallicity and
especially for low temperatures, this aspect is not negligible and
leads to diﬀerent normalizations.
For the X-ray background (XRBG) uniform sky ancillary re-
sponse ﬁles each with a circle of 20(cid:48) radius were used. For all
ARFs 107 photons were simulated in 157 energy steps using xis-
simarfgen and the contamination of the XIS optical blocking ﬁl-
ter was taken into account.

3.3. PSF correction
Suzaku has a PSF of 2(cid:48) half power diameter which is consider-
ably large such that photons can be detected in another annulus
than the one they truly originate from on the sky. This has in-
ﬂuence on the ﬁt results and thus a PSF correction may need
to be applied during the ﬁtting process to take the amount of
photons actually coming from another annulus into account as
well as stray light. We performed a simulation using the xissim
simulator which is also used for the ARF generation. We gener-
ated a photon list of 107 monochromatic X-ray photons of 2 keV
using mkphlist and determined the photon mixing factors. As in-
put for the simulation we used the same input images as for the
ARF generation described earlier. We also performed the simu-
lation for ﬁve diﬀerent energies but found no signiﬁcant energy
dependence. For the central observation the correction factors
are listed in Tab. 2. For the outskirts we found that introducing
the PSF correction in the ﬁt did not change the ﬁt results sig-
niﬁcantly – as it is expected due to the large bin size – but has
inﬂuence on the ﬁt stability. Therefore, we neglected the PSF
eﬀect in the outskirts. From Tab. 2 it can be seen that the mix-
ing of photons from the center to the outer annulus is minimal.
Therefore we don’t expect strong contamination in the outskirts

3.4. Background
The Non-X-ray background (NXB) was determined with xis-
nxbgen using Suzaku night earth data within a time interval of
±150 days around the observation date. A careful treatment of
the background is important, especially in the outskirts where
the group emission is low. The local component of the X-ray
background (LHB) is modeled by an unabsorbed apec model
with solar metallicity; the temperature is left as a free pa-
rameter. The halo component of the background is modeled
by an absorbed apec model, also with solar metallicity and a
temperature of 0.28 keV (e.g. Hoshino et al. 2010, Akamatsu
et al. 2011). The superposition of extragalactic sources is mod-
eled by an absorbed power law with a spectral index of 1.41
(De Luca & Molendi 2004). The full XRBG model is then
phabs × (pow + apec) + apec. All normalizations were ﬂoating
in the ﬁt.
The estimation of the background parameters is supported by
ROSAT all-sky survey data in the energy range from 0.1−2 keV.
Therefore, the ROSAT spectrum3, obtained in an annulus of 0.7−
1 deg from the center where no group emission is expected, is
ﬁtted simultaneously with the Suzaku data, taking into account
the diﬀerent normalizations of the spectra. The background is
assumed to be constant across the full analyzed area.
As discussed by Yoshino et al. (2009), in some cases a galac-
tic component with higher temperature (0.4− 0.9 keV) is needed
to describe the X-Ray background. We tested for the presence of
such a higher temperature gas by ﬁtting the ROSAT data with an
additional apec component. We found that this model is clearly
disfavored by the data comparing the χ2/d.o.f. values which is
not unexpected as such a model is more often needed at low
galactic latitudes which is not the case for our object. Thus, we
proceeded the analysis with the previous described model with-
out an additional component.

3.5. Fitting Strategy
For the central observation the quality of the data allowed us to
constrain some individual abundances or determine upper lim-
its, especially in the inner annuli. Thus, for the group emission
we used a phabs × vapec4 model with the solar abundance table
of Asplund et al. (2009). A vapec model allows to constrain in-
dividual abundances in contrast to the widely used apec model

4 Because of the PSF correction this model has to be extended to
phabs × (vapec + vapec + vapec + vapec) to account for the contami-
nating photons which originate from a diﬀerent annulus on the sky than
they are detected in.

which only allows to determine an overall abundance for all el-
ements. The eﬀect of the chosen abundance table on the ﬁt re-
sults is described in Sec. 3.7. The further out the annuli lie, the
fewer abundance parameters can be constrained by the ﬁt. For
this reason, a ﬁrst ﬁt is performed using an apec model instead
of a vapec model in order to determine the average metallicity
in each annulus. Then, in a second ﬁt, the abundance parameters
of the vapec model, which cannot be constrained by the ﬁt, are
ﬁxed to the average value of the ﬁrst apec ﬁt. The hydrogen col-
umn density is ﬁxed to 4.27 × 1020 cm−2 (Kalberla et al. 2005)
and the spectral ﬁtting is performed in the energy range 0.5 –
8.0 keV.

In the outskirts the group emission is much less than in the
center and thus the statistics to constrain parameters is limited.
For this reason, the analysis in the outskirts followed two major
points: 1. In a ﬁrst step one large annulus from 14(cid:48) – 34(cid:48) covering
almost the full FOV is analyzed in each of the four observations
to check if the group is azimuthally symmetric. 2. If the group
turns out to be symmetric, a simultaneous ﬁt including all four
observations is performed to reduce the statistical error and the
number of annuli can be increased to two.

For the North, East, South and West observation the group
emission is modeled by an absorbed apec model. The temper-
ature, abundance and normalization of the apec model as well
as the normalizations of the three background components and
the LHB temperature were left as free parameters in the ﬁt. The
background temperature for the halo was set to 0.28 keV (see
Sec. 3.4). For the simultaneous analyses the same models and
parameters were used but increasing the number of annuli to two
in the outskirts (from 14(cid:48) – 25(cid:48) and 25(cid:48) – 34(cid:48)) resulting in two
apec models, one for each annulus.

The ﬁtting range was reduced compared to the central ob-
servation to 0.8 – 5.0 keV because no strong emission from the
group is expected at high energies in the outskirts and the im-
pact of the contamination of the XIS optical blocking ﬁlter is
strongest in the low energy regime. Due to imperfect calibration
between front- and back-illuminated chips, the normalizations
for XIS1 were allowed to vary with respect to XIS0 and XIS3 for
all models by introducing a multiplicative constant to the model.
The value of this constant is of the order of 75%.

interval. The lower iron abundances are expected due to the dif-
ferent solar Fe abundances in the two tables. The temperatures
are consistent within the uncertainties.
The NXB background was scaled by ±3% (according to
Tawa et al. 2008) and the ﬁts were repeated. No strong devia-
tions were observed in the ﬁt results compared to the nominal
values (cf. Tab. A.1 and A.2).

E.g. Lumb et al. (2002) measured a lower value for the MWH
gas temperature of 0.2 keV. Therefore, we tested the inﬂuence of
ﬁxing this parameter to 0.2 keV but found no notable impact on
the ﬁt results.

The ﬂuctuations of the CXB due to the statistical ﬂuctua-
tion of the number of point sources in the FOV was measured
by Hayashida et al. (1989) with the Ginga satellite. Following
the procedure described in Ichikawa et al. (2013), the ﬂuctua-
tions were rescaled to the ﬂux limit for point sources used in this
analysis and to the analyzed FOV area. The ﬂuctuation width is
then given by:

with S c being the ﬂux limit and Ωe the eﬀective solid angle of the
analyzed region (Ωe,Ginga = 1.2 deg2). The ﬂux limit for Ginga
is S c,Ginga = 6 × 10−12 erg s−1 cm−2 in the 2 − 10 keV band and
has been rescaled to the energy band 0.5 – 2.0 keV (assuming
a power law with spectral index 2.0). The value of σGinga
= 5
ICXB
is adopted. The ﬂux limit for our observations determined with
Chandra (see Sec. 3.1) is S c,Suzaku = 7× 10−14 erg s−1 cm−2 in the
0.5 – 2.0 keV band.
The resulting values can be found in Tab. 3. The CXB of each
region was scaled according to these values and the ﬁts were
repeated. Tables A.1 and A.2 show the results. No signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on the ﬁt results is observed.

4. Results
In a ﬁrst step, the impact of the input image used for the ARF
generation on the ﬁt results was investigated using an iterative
approach. The Suzaku spectral data was ﬁtted using an ARF in-
put image which was created based on the best ﬁt double-beta
model for the SB from Lovisari et al. (2015). From the results
of this spectral ﬁt the SB was recomputed. The next iteration
step is to create a new input image based on these ﬁt results.
Due to the limited spatial resolution of Suzaku we additionally
use the SB proﬁle from Lovisari et al. (2015). From their best
ﬁt SB model to XMM-Newton we created pseudo-data which
was then ﬁtted simultaneously with the Suzaku results. We use
this pseudo-data because the XMM-Newton best ﬁt beta-model-
proﬁle is corrected for PSF eﬀects (which is not the case for
the original data) that is needed in order to ﬁt simultaneously
with the (PSF corrected) Suzaku data. We created pseudo-data
up to ∼10(cid:48) where the signal to noise ratio for XMM-Newton ap-
proaches one. The simultaneous ﬁt allows us to optimally con-
strain the surface brightness in the center with XMM-Newton
and in the outskirts with Suzaku. With this new SB proﬁle we
created a new input image and recreated the ARF ﬁles. Using

with emissivity  and the volume along the line of sight Vi. The
deprojection of density and temperature was done simultane-
ously by performing a χ2 minimization. For the density proﬁle
we assumed a single-beta model

(3)

(4)

where Rc is the core radius.

The temperature is described by a simple power law

T(R) = ARb,

whereas the cool core (the innermost bin) was excluded as it
can not be described by this simpliﬁed model. The emissivity is
given by  = nenHΛ with Λ being the cooling function which we
assume to be constant along the line of sight. More complicated
models, which also include the cool core, can not be used in this
case due to the limited amount of data. However, we found that
the temperature proﬁle outside R > 2(cid:48) is well described by a
power law (see Sec. 5.3) and therefore this model is suited for
deprojection. In the minimization we computed the XSPEC nor-
malization in each annulus using the single-beta-model for the
electron density, executing the integral in Eq. 1 and compared
it to the measured normalization in the considered annulus. The
same was done (simultaneously) with the temperature follow-
ing Eq. 2. The parameters of the single-beta and the power law
model were free to vary in the minimization.

We also tested a double-beta-model with ﬁxed core radii
(taken from the SB ﬁt of the Suzaku and XMM-Newton data) but
we found no improvement in the minimization and the β-values
of the two components were approximately the same indicating
that a single-beta model is suﬃcient to reproduce the measured
normalizations and temperatures.

The integrated volume Vi corresponding to each annulus i
(i.e the volume along the line of sight) is the cylindrical cut
through a sphere with a radius of three times the maximum ra-
dius we reach with our observation (= 102(cid:48)). Increasing this ra-
dius even further did not change the values of the obtained pa-
rameters signiﬁcantly. The errors were determined using 1000
Monte Carlo (MC) realizations of the measured normalizations
and temperatures assuming gaussian errors and repeating the
minimization. For the minimization and the variation in each
MC step we take the correlation between all data points into ac-
count using the appropriate covariance matrix.

3.7. Systematics
Several sources of systematic uncertainties have been investi-
gated: The chosen abundance table, the uncertainties on the
NXB level and the ﬂuctuation of the CXB due to unresolved
point sources. The results of all of these checks are given in
Tab. A.1.

Selecting the abundance table of Anders & Grevesse (1989)
instead of Asplund et al. (2009) has a minor inﬂuence on the ﬁt
results. The values for the iron abundances in the central obser-
vation are slightly lower as well as the other abundance values.
However, most of them are consistent within the 68% conﬁdence

these ARFs we again performed the spectral ﬁts and determined
the SB proﬁle with Suzaku. We take into account that the PSF
correction changes using the new input image, thus, we repeated
the PSF simulation for each new SB proﬁle and used the up-
dated factors in the ﬁt. The proﬁles after one iteration are shown
in Fig. 7 together with the XMM-Newton pseudo-data. Blue
data points correspond to the Suzaku proﬁle measured with the
ARF input image based on XMM-Newton. Red data points show
the proﬁle after the iteration where XMM-Newton pseudo-data
and the Suzaku results from the ﬁrst step incorporate. The red
solid line represents the best double-beta model proﬁle ﬁt to
the Suzaku and XMM-Newton data (red and green data points)
where the dot-dashed line shows the best single-beta model ﬁt
to the Suzaku data only. The two proﬁles mostly overlap, espe-
cially in the central parts and are in good agreement within the
uncertainties. Thus, we conclude that one iteration is suﬃcient
to get a good representation of the actual SB proﬁle of the group
in the ARF generation. For further discussion of the SB proﬁle
see Sec. 5.

As described in Sec. 3.5, the ﬁrst ﬁt to the data of the cen-
tral observation was performed using an apec model. The re-
sults for this ﬁt are given in Tab. 4. The abundance values de-
termined in this ﬁt are then used to ﬁx the indeterminable abun-
dance parameters of the vapec model in the second ﬁt. For the
latter, the results are given in Tab. A.1. We measured individ-
ual abundances for Mg, Si, S, Ar and Ca whereas some of those
can only be constrained in the inner annuli or only upper lim-
its are given (cf. Tab. A.1). The temperature for the local back-
ground component agrees well with Hoshino et al. (2010) and
Akamatsu et al. (2011). The CXB intensity in the 2 − 10 keV
band is 2.30+0.18−0.17 × 10−11erg s−1 cm−2 deg−2 and in good agree-
ment with measurements by e.g. Lumb et al. (2002) and De Luca
& Molendi (2004). The spectra together with the best ﬁt vapec
models are shown in Fig. 5. No strong residuals can be seen and
the χ2/d.o.f. is 1.2.

The ﬁt results for individual ﬁts of the North, East, South and
West observation are given in Tab. 5. For better comparability the
normalizations have been rescaled to match the central input im-
age which is necessary due to the diﬀerent input images during
ARF generation. The values for temperatures, abundances and
normalizations are mostly consistent within one standard devia-

tion. Only the western observation shows slightly higher temper-
ature and normalization but this deviation is not signiﬁcant (less
than 2σ). Of course, the uncertainties are quite large due to the
limited statistics in the outskirts which we improved in a simulta-
neous ﬁt of all outer observations. The values for the background
parameters agree within the uncertainties which gives us conﬁ-
dence in our treatment of the background. For these reasons, we
conclude that the galaxy group is suﬃciently symmetric in the
azimuthal directions so that a simultaneous ﬁt of all outskirts
observations is justiﬁed. The increased statistics in the ﬁt allows
for splitting the outer region from 14(cid:48) – 34(cid:48) into two annuli from
14(cid:48) – 25(cid:48) and 25(cid:48) – 34(cid:48). The sizes of the regions were chosen
such that they contain roughly the same amount of counts. The
results for this ﬁt are given in Tab. 6. The corresponding spectra
are shown in Fig. 6 where no strong residuals are visible.
As expected from the individual ﬁts, the temperature in the
outskirts is slightly above ∼1 keV. The abundance in both regions
is consistent within the uncertainties. The background parame-

5. Discussion
5.1. Surface brightness proﬁle
Vikhlinin et al. (1999) found that a single-beta model proﬁle
with β = 0.65 − 0.85 well describes the surface brightness pro-
ﬁles for 39 local clusters in the range (0.3−1) R180 measured with
ROSAT PSPC. However, e.g. Komossa & B¨ohringer (1999) and
Hwang et al. (1999) measured ﬂatter proﬁles for galaxy groups
with β ∼ 0.4 − 0.5. When we perform a single-beta model ﬁt to
the Suzaku SB data (dot-dashed line and red data points in Fig.
7) we obtain β = 0.55 ± 0.01 which is in agreement with the
results for galaxy groups. E.g. Khosroshahi et al. (2007) mea-
sured the SB proﬁles of a sample of fossil groups and found
values of β = 0.43 − 0.60 which is similar to our ﬁndings. These

8

smaller β-values compared to galaxy clusters have already been
seen in early ROSAT results from e.g. David et al. (1995) and
Henry et al. (1995). The former studied three groups as part of a
larger cluster sample and found β = 0.38 − 0.53 whereas the
clusters gave higher values between β = 0.53 − 0.74. Henry
et al. (1995) found comparable results for their study of four
galaxy groups. Doe et al. (1995) measured the SB proﬁle for
ﬁve poor clusters with ROSAT PSPC and also found values be-
tween β = 0.47−0.60. All these results clearly show that there is
a deviating behavior of galaxy groups compared to galaxy clus-
ters concerning the surface brightness. For our measurement (cf.
Fig. 7) we note, that the last data point shows a weak indica-
tion for a ﬂattening of the proﬁle towards larger radii compared
to the single-beta model ﬁt. Such a ﬂattening could be reﬂected
in the density proﬁle (cf. 5.2) and was observed previously with
Suzaku by e.g. Kawaharada et al. (2010). They found a ﬂatten-
ing in the density proﬁle for a Suzaku observation of the clus-
ter A1689. A ﬂatter proﬁle aﬀects the hydrostatic mass estimate
and can result in lower total cluster masses. We note that a ﬂat-
tening has been observed by other Suzaku studies, too. E.g. Su
et al. (2013) measured a clearly higher density in the outskirts
compared to their best ﬁt single-beta model for a fossil group.
Also Simionescu et al. (2011) measured a ﬂattening of the den-
sity proﬁle for the North-East direction of the Perseus cluster.
One explanation for the ﬂattening is gas clumping in the out-
skirts of clusters and groups which can lead to an overestimate
in the gas density. Nagai & Lau (2011) performed hydrodynami-
cal simulations of 16 galaxy clusters and studied the eﬀect of gas
clumping in the outer parts. Their results suggest that this eﬀect
is not negligible when dealing with cluster outskirts. Therefore,
it is very important to have accurate calibration of the instru-
ments and more studies reaching large radii, to deduce weather
the ﬂattening is an instrumental eﬀect or a real property of the
gas in the outskirts of groups and clusters.

However, for our measured SB proﬁle, the simultaneous
double-beta model ﬁt to XMM-Newton pseudo-data and Suzaku
prefers a slightly ﬂatter proﬁle in the outskirts, indicating that
XMM-Newton tends to larger SB values compared to Suzaku
when going to larger radii. This is also represented by the green
dashed line which shows the extrapolated XMM-Newton pro-
ﬁle obtained by Lovisari et al. (2015). The extrapolated proﬁle
clearly diﬀers from the Suzaku measurement in the outer parts
of the group and emphasizes the importance of having accurate
measurements out to large radii to avoid biases in the calcula-
tions due to extrapolation.

5.2. Density proﬁle

The deprojected density proﬁle is shown in Fig. 8. The best
ﬁt parameters for the single-beta model can be found in Tab.
7. For the deprojection we reconstructed the XSPEC normal-
izations using Eq. 1. The statistical uncertainties are small due
to the small statistical errors of the XSPEC normalization (see
Tab. A.1) which dominate the shape of the beta model. We
note that especially for a low temperature plasma the normaliza-
tion and abundance parameter of the apec model are correlated.
Therefore, we checked whether ﬁxing the abundance leads to
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent normalizations. We tested for two cases:
1. ﬁxing the abundance to 0.3 Z(cid:12) for both regions and 2. a more
extreme case, ﬁxing the parameters to 0.4 Z(cid:12) and 0.2 Z(cid:12) for re-
gion 5 and 6, respectively. The ﬁrst case yields similar results
compared to the nominal ﬁt for temperature and normalization.
For the second case we ﬁnd a ∼35 % higher normalization in the
outermost region, however, all the values are consistent within
the uncertainties with the results when the abundance parame-

ﬁle in Fig. 7). If the determined deprojected density proﬁle in
the outskirts is slightly steeper than the actual proﬁle, the nor-
malizations determined in the minimization will lead to a lower
value than the observed one. As for the SB proﬁle the indica-
tion for a ﬂattening is not signiﬁcant and in our case, the over-
all proﬁle is well reproduced by our method using a single-beta
model. As mentioned above, a systematic ﬂattening would have
signiﬁcant impact on the mass estimates. As it is diﬃcult to get
robust constraints in the outskirts and many analyses are limited
to R500, density proﬁles are often extrapolated to larger radii. If
the actual density proﬁle is ﬂatter in the outer parts this extrap-
olation results in an overestimation of the total mass or, on the
other hand, if non gravitational eﬀects such as clumping bias
gas density measurements in the outskirts towards higher values
this would cause an underestimation of the cluster mass. These
eﬀects have direct inﬂuence on the determination of cosmologi-
cal parameters and could cause biases. Additionally, we need to
know which other non-gravitational eﬀects might aﬀect the mea-
surements. Beside clumping also non-equilibrium states such as
deviations from thermal equilibrium between protons and elec-
trons might be present as suggested by measurements from e.g.
Akamatsu et al. (2011). See Reiprich et al. (2013) for a review
of these eﬀects. This can be best tested using the entropy proﬁle
and the gas mass fraction which we investigate in the following.

5.3. Temperature proﬁle

The temperature proﬁles for UGC03957 measured with Suzaku
and by Lovisari et al. (2015) with XMM-Newton are shown
in Fig. 10. Both proﬁles clearly show the cool core of the
group and are in very good agreement within the uncertainties.
Nevertheless, we note that XMM-Newton tends to higher val-

ters are left as a free parameters in the ﬁt. Thus, we proceed
using the results from the latter ﬁt as in this case the statistical
uncertainties on the abundance can be taken into account for the
further analysis.

The measured normalizations from each annulus and the nor-
malizations determined from the minimization are shown in Fig.

units. The comparison shows that our measurement can be well
reproduced by a single-beta model proﬁle. The last data point
is slightly lower than the measured XSPEC normalization, how-
ever, the indication for a ﬂattening is weak (see also the SB pro-

ues around R∼10(cid:48) which would lead to a bias if the proﬁle is
extrapolated to larger radii.
A temperature drop of a factor of ∼3 from the center to the
outskirts of the group is consistent with previous Suzaku mea-
surements of galaxy clusters (cf. Fig. 9 of Reiprich et al. 2013).
The solid lines in Fig. 10 correspond to the best ﬁt power law
model to the projected Suzaku data points (blue line) and the
deprojected proﬁle (red line). The innermost bin was excluded.
As expected due to the negative temperature gradient, we see
that the deprojected temperature proﬁle is slightly higher than
the projected one. In the following the deprojected temperature
proﬁle is used to compute mass and entropy.

5.4. Abundance and supernova ratio
Fig. 11 shows the abundance proﬁle using the average abun-
dances determined in the apec ﬁt for the central observation and
the abundance measured in the outer observations reaching be-
yond R200. The abundance drops from the innermost to the sec-
ond bin and then shows a rather ﬂat behavior out to the outskirts.
The proﬁle is in good agreement with the XMM-Newton mea-
surements where they overlap in the inner parts.

Kapferer et al. (2007) simulated two possible mechanisms
for the enrichment of the ICM: ram-pressure stripping and galac-
tic winds. Ram pressure stripping is most eﬀective at high den-
sities, thus in the center of galaxy groups and clusters whereas
it is expected to have less inﬂuence at the outer parts. Galactic
winds are more eﬀective in lower density regions because of the
lower pressure of the surrounding material. In their simulation
Kapferer et al. (2007) showed that for ram-pressure stripping
as the primary process a steeper abundance proﬁle is expected
than for galactic winds. Therefore, the ﬂat proﬁle in our mea-
surement is a hint for galactic winds as the dominant enrichment
process outside the group center. This is consistent with the ﬁrst
abundance measurements out to the virial radius of two galaxy
clusters (Fujita et al. 2008). From the central to the second bin a
steep gradient is observed. Here the impact of the brightest cen-
tral galaxy which is probably signiﬁcantly contributing to the
enrichment is an important factor.

(for values see Tab. 4) in blue and XMM-Newton (Lovisari et al.
2015) in green.

We also studied individual abundances in the inner annuli
of the central observation. We note a high Ar and Ca abun-
dance in the innermost annulus (albeit with high uncertainties),
yielding Ar/Fe = 2.6 ± 0.7 and Ca/Fe = 1.3+0.6−0.5, respectively.
E.g. Simionescu et al. (2009) found comparable high values for
Ca/Fe in the central region of the Hydra A cluster. Also de
Plaa et al. (2007) measured individual abundances for a sam-
ple of 22 galaxy clusters observed with XMM-Newton and for
several clusters found high Ca/Fe values of ∼1.5 Z(cid:12). However,
they found lower Ar/Fe values in the central parts whereas a
stacked analyses of all archival X-ray ASCA data performed by
Baumgartner et al. (2005) yield comparable high Ar abundance
for the low temperature systems. Our measured abundance val-
ues for Mg, Si and S in the central parts are in good agreement
with Suzaku measurements by e.g. Sato et al. (2007b), Tokoi
et al. (2008) and Komiyama et al. (2009), the latter also studying
a galaxy group.

The ratio of SNIa and SNCC which exploded in the past can
be determined using the abundances of α-elements such as Si
and S compared to Fe. We measured the abundance of these ele-
ments at intermediate radii between 2(cid:48) − 11(cid:48) to minimize a pos-
sible inﬂuence of the central galaxy (indicated by the steep gra-
dient in Fig. 11) yielding ZFe = 0.39+0.06−0.06 Z(cid:12), ZSi = 0.46+0.16−0.15 Z(cid:12)
and ZS = 0.70+0.25−0.24Z(cid:12). Then we follow the procedure described
by Lovisari et al. (2009) and determine the SN ratio for each
of the two elements. Two models for the yields of SNIa were
tested: a deﬂagration model (W7-model) and a delayed deto-
nation model (WDD2), as described in Iwamoto et al. (1999).
Average SNCC yields in the mass range of 10M(cid:12) to 50M(cid:12),
calculated by Tsujimoto et al. (1995) assuming a Salpeter ini-
tial mass function, were used. The SN ratio is deﬁned as R =
NSNCC/(NSNCC +NSNIa), where N is the number of SN for a given
type.

The results are given in Tab. 8. Both models yield similar
results and are consistent within the uncertainties. The SN ra-
tios for Si and S also match within the uncertainties, thus, the
observed abundances for UGC03957 can be explained by a rel-
ative contribution to the ICM enrichment of 80% – 100% for
SNCC. Similar results have been reported by Sato et al. (2010)
for the fossil group NGC 1550. Also Rasmussen & Ponman
(2007) found that for their galaxy group sample outside the cool
core SNCC dominate the enrichment over SNIa. Recent results

Virgo Cluster gave comparable results with a relative contribu-
tion of 79%−85% for SNCC indicating a similar enrichment his-
tory for galaxy groups and clusters. They measured abundance
ratios beyond the virial radius for the ﬁrst time and ruled out an
enrichment of solely SNCC at large radii at 9σ level. However,
the authors note that due to the limited accuracy of the SN yield
models uncertainties in the measurements still remain.

5.5. Gas mass and total mass
With the deprojected gas density and the temperature proﬁles we
computed the X-ray hydrostatic mass of the galaxy group using
the hydrostatic equation:
Mtot(< R) = − kTgasR
Gµmp

(cid:32)d ln ρgas

d ln Tgas
d ln R

d ln R

(cid:33)

(6)

+

with mp being the proton mass, µ the mean molecular weight and
G the gravitational constant. We ﬁnd a value of M(< R200) =
(1.02+0.04−0.04) × 1014 M(cid:12). Using the density proﬁle we obtain an es-
timate for R200 yielding R200 = 23.7(cid:48). This value is considerably
lower than the ﬁrst estimate from the RASS data.
We obtain the gas mass fraction proﬁle as shown in Fig.
12 (innermost part is not shown due to our simpliﬁed tempera-
ture model which does not describe the cool core). Up to R500
the gas mass fraction is below 10% which is a typical value
found for galaxy groups as e.g. in Lovisari et al. (2015), Sun
et al. (2009) and Humphrey et al. (2012). Galaxy clusters typ-
ically show somewhat higher gas mass fraction above 0.1 as
e.g. found by Vikhlinin et al. (2006). In galaxy groups feedback
processes have more eﬀect than in clusters and lead to further
expulsion of the gas. Beyond R500 the fraction of UGC03957
rises up to ∼13% at R200 and ∼18% at the maximum radius we
reach with our observation which is slightly above the cosmic
mean value. This behavior is in contrast to measurements by
e.g. Simionescu et al. (2011) for the Perseus cluster and Walker
et al. (2012a) for the cluster PKS 0745191. They measured gas
mass fractions of ∼0.23 and ∼0.19 already around R200, respec-
tively, while UGC03957 only rises above this value far beyond
R200. Eckert et al. (2013a) investigated the gas properties for a
sample of 18 galaxy clusters with combined ROSAT and Planck
data. They found fgas around 18% beyond R200 in agreement with
our ﬁndings. A likely explanation for this excess is a deviation
from hydrostatic equilibrium. If the assumption of hydrostatic
equilibrium is violated this can result in a lower total mass esti-
mate and therefore a higher gas mass fraction. E.g. Piﬀaretti &
Valdarnini (2008) showed – by performing N-body/SPH simula-
tions of about 100 galaxy clusters – that masses can be underes-
timated by up to 15% at R200.

5.6. Entropy proﬁle
A good indicator for the hydrodynamical status of the ICM is
the entropy which we obtained by combining the deprojected
density and temperature proﬁles using the entropy deﬁnition

K = kTn
e with Boltzmann constant k. The derived proﬁle is

shown in Fig. 13 in green. Voit (2005) performed non-radiative
simulations from gravitational structure formation and found
that their simulated cluster sample follows the relation

However, in this ﬁt to the simulated data the slope was ﬁxed
to the common literature value of 1.1, but the authors note that
outside 0.2R200 their sample seems to indicate a slightly steeper
slope. For this reason they performed another ﬁt with free slope

Fig. 13 shows both ﬁts together with our measurement (green
line and shaded area corresponding to 68% conﬁdence region).
At ∼R200 our measurements agree with the expectation but at
smaller radii we ﬁnd a clear entropy excess compared to the nu-
merical prediction. Pratt et al. (2010) analyzed 31 nearby clus-
ters and found a similar behavior for their sample i.e. many en-
tropy proﬁles showing larger deviation towards the central re-
gions. They reported that the proﬁles match well with the nu-
merical simulations by Voit (2005) when a gas mass fraction
correction is applied which also reduces the scatter in the en-
tropy proﬁles signiﬁcantly. The correction is as follows:
Kcorr = Kmeasure × fgas(< R)2/3 f −2/3
with the cosmic baryon fraction fb = 0.15 (Planck Collaboration
et al. 2013b). We applied the correction to our entropy proﬁle
which is shown in red in Fig. 13. The resulting proﬁle is in
much better agreement with Eq. 7 with a ﬁxed slope of 1.1.
Compared to Eq. 9 (the ﬁt to the simulated cluster sample of
Voit (2005) with free slope) we even ﬁnd a perfect agreement.
As in their sample, our measurement for UGC03957 suggests

ulation in the outskirts. This seems to indicate a diﬀerence be-
tween galaxy groups and clusters regarding the impact of non-
gravitational eﬀects on the entropy proﬁle in the outskirts. We
note that using simple models for temperature and density pro-
ﬁles (i.e. power law and single-beta model, respectively) results
in a power-law description of the entropy proﬁle which in prin-
ciple can not reﬂect more complicated behavior. However, these
models describe our data very well and an entropy ﬂattening is
absent for our object. Additionally, we tested for a double-beta
model for the deprojection and ﬁnd a consistent proﬁle com-
pared to the single-beta case in the outskirts (cf. Sec. 3.6). Hence,
we are conﬁdent that our models yield a reliable entropy proﬁle.
However, even for galaxy clusters the entropy measurements
are contradictory as shown by Eckert et al. (2013b) who ana-
lyzed 18 clusters and found a better agreement of the average
entropy proﬁle with numerical simulations at R > R500 in con-
trast to Walker et al. (2013). One point discussed in Eckert et al.
(2013b) is the missing azimuthal completeness in most Suzaku
studies which might explain the diﬀerent ﬁndings. Our study and
also Su et al. (2015) have good azimuthal coverage while Su
et al. (2013) only studied one azimuthal direction. Thus, good
azimuthal coverage may be important to obtain overall cluster
and group entropy proﬁles. Nevertheless, to constrain a “uni-
versal entropy proﬁle” for galaxy clusters and in particular for
galaxy groups, larger samples are needed which then also allow
for studying the impact of non-gravitational eﬀects in greater de-
tail.

6. Conclusion
We analyzed ﬁve Suzaku observations of a galaxy group, reach-
ing ∼1.4R200. We found that the group is azimuthally symmetric
and performed a simultaneous ﬁt of all outskirts observations
and determined the temperature, abundance, surface brightness,
density, entropy and fgas proﬁles. Our main ﬁndings are the fol-
lowing:

– The surface brightness proﬁle is consistent with previous
measurements of galaxy groups with a single-beta-model ﬁt
to the Suzaku data yielding β = 0.55± 0.01. Extrapolation of
the XMM-Newton best ﬁt double-beta model leads to large
deviation from our Suzaku measurements and emphasizes
the importance of accurate measurements out to large radii
to avoid biases.

– The temperature proﬁle drops by almost a factor of three
from the center to the outskirts. This is consistent with previ-
ous Suzaku analyses for galaxy clusters as shown in Reiprich
et al. (2013) and supports a self-similar picture.

– The abundance proﬁle shows a ﬂat behavior outside the cen-
ter which points to galactic winds as the primary enrichment
process, as found in simulations by Kapferer et al. (2007).
– The abundance pattern of the group can be explained by a
relative contribution of ∼80% – 100% for SNCC to the ICM
enrichment. This is comparable with the results from previ-
ous measurements for galaxy groups (e.g. Sato et al. 2010
and Sato et al. 2007a) and also with recent results for the
Virgo cluster (Simionescu et al. 2015b).

– The gas mass fraction increases with radius and is <0.1 in-
side R500 which is comparable to previous results for galaxy
groups (e.g. Lovisari et al. 2015, Sun et al. 2009, Humphrey
et al. 2012) but in contrast to galaxy clusters which show
higher gas mass fractions. One explanation are feedback pro-
cesses which act more eﬃcient in galaxy groups. Outside
R200 the gas mass fraction exceeds the cosmic mean value
while inside this radius it stays below ∼13% in contrast

a slightly steeper slope than the literature value of 1.1. Pratt
et al. (2010) discussed several possible explanations for entropy
modiﬁcation: Pre-heating processes or AGN feedback can lift
the entropy in the central region as e.g. discussed by Wang
et al. (2010). Feedback from the central AGN or convection and
bulk motion can push the central gas further outwards or even
eject gas from the object, especially in low mass systems with a
shallower gravitational potential well, leading to higher entropy.
E.g. Wang et al. (2010) measured entropy proﬁles for 31 galaxy
groups and clusters and found a clear central entropy excess for
all objects. They compared their observation with observation-
ally constrained supernovae explosion rates as well as the con-
tribution of AGN feedback and concluded that AGNs can be re-
sponsible for the excess entropy. However, the observations have
been performed with the Chandra satellite and in most cases
only reach R500. To explain the excess in our analysis, the de-
scribed eﬀects must have impact on the gas out to large radii
which is more presumable for the low mass systems. McCarthy
et al. (2010) explicitly focused on simulations of AGN feedback
in galaxy groups. Their simulations reproduce the observations
up to R500 and the central entropy excess very well.

Humphrey et al. (2012) and Su et al. (2013) studied the
galaxy groups RXJ1159+5531 and ESO 3060170, respectively,
and obtained similar results to our study. Both found an en-
tropy excess out to large radii for their objects and good overall
agreement with the simulations by Voit (2005) after applying the
fgas correction. Recently Su et al. (2015) extended the study of
RXJ1159+5531 to full azimuthal completeness and conﬁrmed
this entropy behavior. Nevertheless, Su et al. (2013) reported an
entropy drop at ∼R200 which is consistent with observations for
several galaxy clusters. Walker et al. (2013) compared the en-
tropy proﬁle for seven clusters obtained in previous analyses to
the baseline prediction of Voit (2005) and found a signiﬁcant en-
tropy ﬂattening (or even a drop for some clusters) at large radii.
They suggest clumping as one possible explanation, but also de-
viations from thermal equilibrium between electrons and protons
can lower the entropy. However, the results of Humphrey et al.
(2012), Su et al. (2015) and also our results match well the sim-

to what was previously observed for the Perseus cluster
(Simionescu et al. 2011) which showed high gas mass frac-
tions already around R200. A likely explanation is the break-
down of hydrostatic equilibrium in the outer parts of the
group where the gas has not yet virialized.

– The measured entropy proﬁle shows an excess compared to
numerical simulations performed by Voit (2005). Correcting
the entropy proﬁle as suggested by Pratt et al. (2010) leads
to good agreement with the simulations and indicating a
slightly steeper slope than the expected value of 1.1. We
conclude that feedback processes and the redistribution of
material e.g. due to AGN activity – especially imprinting in
galaxy groups with a lower potential well – play a major role
out to larger radii than in galaxy clusters. Also pre-heating
processes might be responsible for the observed excess. Our
ﬁndings are in agreement with Eckert et al. (2013b) and the
study of a fossil group performed by Humphrey et al. (2012)
but in contrast to results for galaxy clusters measured by
Walker et al. (2013) which showed an entropy drop around
R200 pointing to non-gravitational eﬀects such as gas clump-
ing or non-equilibrium states in the outskirts of the clusters.
The latter hints at a possible diﬀerence between groups and
clusters, however, azimuthal completeness of the studies is
an important factor and might (partially) explain the diﬀer-
ent ﬁndings.
