Abstract

We present the results of a third order calculation of the pion-nucleon scattering amplitude
in a chiral eﬀective ﬁeld theory with pions, nucleons and delta resonances as explicit degrees of
freedom. We work in a manifestly Lorentz invariant formulation of baryon chiral perturbation
theory using dimensional regularization and the extended on-mass-shell renormalization scheme.
In the delta resonance sector, the on mass-shell renormalization is realized as a complex-mass
scheme. By ﬁtting the low-energy constants of the eﬀective Lagrangian to the S- and P -partial
waves a satisfactory description of the phase shifts from the analysis of the Roy-Steiner equations is
obtained. We predict the phase shifts for the D and F waves and compare them with the results of
the analysis of the George Washington University group. The threshold parameters are calculated
both in the delta-less and delta-full cases. Based on the determined low-energy constants, we
discuss the pion-nucleon sigma term. Additionally, in order to determine the strangeness content
of the nucleon, we calculate the octet baryon masses in the presence of decuplet resonances up to
next-to-next-to-leading order in SU(3) baryon chiral perturbation theory. The octet baryon sigma
terms are predicted as a byproduct of this calculation.

INTRODUCTION

Elastic pion-nucleon (πN ) scattering has been studied extensively since the middle of
the last century (see e.g. Refs. [1, 2]), not only due to the wealth of experimental data,
but also because of its importance for our understanding of chiral dynamics of quantum
chromodynamics (QCD). From the theory side, in order to describe such a fundamental
process, dispersion relations for πN scattering have been investigated several decades ago [3–
5] and many phenomenological models and diﬀerent approaches have been proposed (see,
e.g., Refs. [6–13]). Roy-Steiner equations for the pion-nucleon scattering have been also
analysed recently [14–17]. In the low-energy region a systematic and powerful tool to study
πN scattering is provided by chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) [18–21]. An extension of
the range of applicability of chiral eﬀective ﬁeld theory (EFT) beyond the low-energy region
has been also suggested in the recent work of Ref. [22].

ChPT is the EFT of QCD in the low-energy region, which is widely used in modern
hadronic physics. It has the same symmetries as its underlying theory and is based on an
expansion in powers of small quark masses and external momenta, collectively denoted by
p. According to the power counting rules of ChPT, powers of p are assigned to Feynman
diagrams and used to estimate the relative importance of their contributions in physical
quantities. Hence, low-energy physical quantities, which can not be obtained within per-
turbative QCD, are calculated in a perturbative expansion in powers of p. Purely mesonic
ChPT, the theory of Goldstone bosons only, has been very successful [19, 20]. However, in
baryon chiral perturbation theory (BChPT), which additionally takes baryons into account,
the power counting becomes subtle due to the non-zero baryon masses in the chiral limit. A
ﬁrst attempt to study elastic πN scattering using BChPT was made in Ref. [23]. Therein,
the power counting rule was shown to be broken when the baryon propagators are involved
in loop integrals, namely loop diagrams give contributions of orders lower than assigned by
the power counting.

To remedy this power counting breaking (PCB) issue, several approaches were proposed
during the last decades. The most well-known approach is to calculate physical quantities
within heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory (HBChPT) [24, 25].
In order to restore
the power counting, a simultaneous expansion in p and in inverse powers of the baryon
mass is performed. Within this framework πN scattering was analysed in detail up to
order O(p3) [26, 27] and later up to order O(p4) [28]. A good description of partial wave
phase shifts has been achieved near threshold. However, the non-relativistic heavy baryon
expansion distorts the analytic structure of the amplitudes, e.g. the location of the poles of
baryon propagators are shifted, and also convergence problems are encountered in certain
low-energy regions, e.g. for the scalar form factor of the nucleon at t = 4M 2
π [29]. It should be
noted, however, that the proper analytic structure can be regained if one includes subleasing
terms in the heavy baryon propagator, see e.g. [30]. In any case, it is of interest to treat the
PCB problem within covariant BChPT. A pioneering work in Ref. [31] restored the power
counting by keeping only the so-called soft parts of the Feynman diagrams. Successively,
a much more elegant approach, known as infrared regularization (IR), was proposed in
Ref. [29] and later extended/reformulated in Refs. [32–35]. All the Feynman integrals in
the IR regularization scheme are divided into infrared singular parts, respecting the power
counting rules, and infrared regular parts, possibly violating them, and therefore the latter
are discarded by means of absorbing them in (an inﬁnite number of) the low-energy constants
(LECs) of the eﬀective Lagrangian. By making use of the IR scheme, πN scattering has been

2

studied up to O(p4) order [36] (see also Ref. [37] for O(p3) order calculation). Besides, the
analyses of the isospin violation and the SU(3) sector of BChPT have also been considered
in Refs. [38] and [39], respectively. However, the IR regularization has its own drawbacks:
the presence of an unphysical u-channel cut [29, 31] and the prediction of a large discrepancy
of the Goldberger-Treiman (GT) relation [37]. All these problems are due to dropping the
entire infrared regular parts.

The extended-on-mass-shell (EOMS) scheme, developed in Refs. [40–42], is an alternative
approach to solve the PCB problem. It removes the power counting breaking terms (PCBT)
at the level of amplitudes (or observables) by absorbing them into the renormalization of
LECs of the eﬀective Lagrangian. This is due to the fact that the PCBTs are polynomials
of momenta and/or quark masses. The EOMS scheme preserves the analytic structure of
the physical quantities, e.g. scattering amplitudes. πN scattering has been calculated using
EOMS scheme in Ref. [43] up to order O(p3) and in Ref. [44] up to order O(p4). Contributions
to the scattering amplitudes obtained in those works possess the correct power counting
and correct analytic properties. Moreover, the existing results of partial wave analysis are
described well, and remarkably, reasonable predictions for discrepancy of GT relation and
the pion-nucleon sigma term σπN are obtained. Nevertheless, as pointed out in Ref. [43],
the convergence of the chiral expansion of the O(p3) order πN scattering amplitude within
EOMS scheme is questionable when the ∆(1232) is not taken as an explicit degree of freedom.
This implies the necessity of including the ∆(1232) resonances as explicit degrees of freedom
in the eﬀective Lagrangian, together with nucleons and pions.

In this work, we present the full third order (leading one loop) calculation of the pion-
nucleon scattering amplitude in a manifestly Lorentz invariant formulation of BChPT with
explicit deltas. We perform renormalization using the EOMS scheme such that the power
counting violating terms are dealt with properly. The S- and P -wave phase shifts are
extracted from the manifestly Lorentz invariant amplitudes and then ﬁtted to the phase
shifts obtained from the recent Roy-Steiner (RS) equation analysis of πN scattering [17]
such that all involved LECs are determined. Based on the obtained LECs, we predict the
D- and F -wave phase shifts and compare them with the results of the George Washington
University (GWU) group analysis [45]. The threshold parameters are determined for both
the delta-less and delta-full cases. In addition, we discuss the pion-nucleon sigma term and
the strangeness content of the nucleon in SU(3) BChPT.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section II we introduce the notations and the kine-
matics for the pion-nucleon scattering amplitudes. Terms of the chiral eﬀective Lagrangian
that are needed for our third order calculation of the pion-nucleon scattering amplitude
are speciﬁed in Section III. Contributions of tree and one loop diagrams in the scattering
amplitude are discussed in Section IV. Renormalization of the one loop diagrams and the
deﬁnitions of the pion-nucleon, gπN , and pion-nucleon-delta, gπN ∆, couplings are given in
Section V. Section VI contains the extraction of the phase shifts. The baryon sigma terms
and the strangeness content of the nucleon are discussed in Section VII. We summarize our
results in Section VIII and the appendices contain explicit expressions of various quantities
as well as other technicalities.

C. Extracting phase shifts from perturbative amplitudes

In chiral EFT, the scattering amplitude f (s) can be calculated perturbatively up to
certain order O(pP ) (for simplicity, all indices of the amplitudes are suppressed in this
section),

fP (s) = f (1)(s) + f (2)(s) + . . . + f (P )(s) .

(15)

The full amplitude f (s) = fP =∞(s) satisﬁes the partial wave unitarity condition exactly,
however, fP(cid:54)=∞(s) does not. The phase shifts can be calculated using

(cid:26)

(cid:27)

q(s)

Re [fP (s)−1]

δ(s) = Arctan

.

(16)

This is equivalent to constructing a unitarized amplitude f U (s) corresponding to fP (s) by
setting

Re(cid:2)f U (s)(cid:3) = N · Re [fP (s)] ,
Im(cid:2)f U (s)(cid:3) = N · q(s)|fP (s)|2 = N · q(s)(cid:2)(RefP (s))2 + (ImfP (s))2(cid:3)

(17)

and then extracting the phase shifts by substituting the partial wave amplitudes correspond-
ing to f U (s) in Eq. (14). Here, N is given by the expression

(cid:34)

N =

[RefP (s)]2
|fP (s)|2 + |q(s)fP (s)|2

(cid:35)−1

.

(18)

(19)

For all partial waves except P33 we use the following expression

δ(s) = Arctan{q(s)Re [fP (s)]} .

For the non-resonant partial waves the phase shifts given by Eqs. (19) and (16) diﬀer by
higher order contributions only.

terms, which introduce interactions of deltas with pions and nucleons.

IV. CALCULATION OF THE PION-NUCLEON AMPLITUDE UP TO NNLO

A. Power counting

For diagrams involving only pion and nucleon lines, we use the standard power counting
of Refs. [49, 50]. For diagrams with delta lines we apply the power counting of Refs. [48, 51],
that is we count the mass diﬀerence ∆ = m∆ − mN as of order O(p), although we do not
expand the interaction terms of the eﬀective Lagrangian and the physical quantities in ∆.
The above power counting leads to the dressing of the delta propagator in the resonant
region (for a diﬀerent point of view, see Refs. [52, 53]).

π (a (cid:54)= 0) and B = Mπ + bM 4

In particular, it is self-consistent to count A − B ∼ pn if A ∼ pn and B ∼ pn, however,
more care has to be taken when dealing with inverse powers of similar diﬀerences. From
A ∼ pn, B ∼ pn it does not necessarily follow that 1/(A − B) ∼ p−n. For example, if we
have A = Mπ + aM 3
π (b (cid:54)= a), by counting A − B as of order p
we overestimate this diﬀerence (which causes no problems), however, if we count 1/(A − B)
as of order 1/p, we underestimate this quantity, which is apparently of order 1/p3 and
that leads to inconsistency. Considering the delta propagator appearing in the intermediate
states in the s-channel diagrams Dµν
N − 2mN ∆ + O(∆2)), we
count s − m2
∆) =
1/(s − m2
∆ this propagator diverges, so do all
diagrams with multiple self-energy insertions, therefore we need to sum up these diagrams,
i.e. consider the dressed propagator Dµν(k) ∼ 1/(/k − m∆ − Σ(k)). For /k → m∆ we obtain
Dµν(k) ∼ 1/(−Σ(k)) ∼ 1/p3 as the leading contribution in the self-energy is of order O(p3).
We follow an alternative way of dealing with the problem by using the complex-mass scheme,
speciﬁed later, where the undressed propagator contains the width of the unstable particle
and therefore the re-summation is not needed.

N ∼ p, ∆ ∼ p, however, it would be wrong to conclude that ∼ 1/(s − m2

N − ∆(mN + m∆)) ∼ 1/p. For s → m2

∆) = 1/(s − m2

0 ∼ 1/(s − m2

B. Tree level contributions

The Feynman tree diagrams contributing to the pion-nucleon scattering amplitude up to
order O(p3) are displayed in Fig. 1 with chiral orders speciﬁed in front of them. The crossed
diagrams are not shown since their contributions can be obtained by using the crossing
relations given in Eq. (6). The diagrams with mass insertions in propagators, which are
π∆ for the delta, are not
shown either. Their contributions are automatically taken into account if one replaces the

πN for the nucleon and a1 term in L(2)

generated by the c1 term in L(2)

As can be seen from Figure 1, there are three diﬀerent types of contributions: nucleon-
exchange, contact-interaction and delta-exchange diagrams. The s-channel Born-term con-
tributions of the nucleon-exchange diagrams, namely the sum of contributions of diagrams
(a), (g) and (h), can be written as

case, m∆ should be understood as m∆,2 but we keep using m∆ for short. Tree order ampli-
tudes corresponding to diagrams (d), (e), (j), (k) and (l) are given in Appendix A. However,
they are redundant in the sense that their contributions can be taken into account by the
redeﬁnition of h in Eq. (35) and the LECs in the contact terms, Eq. (33). By redeﬁning the

(j = 1, 2, 3, 5, 14, 15).

C. Leading one-loop contributions

The one-loop Feynman diagrams up to order O(p3), without and with explicit deltas,
are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, respectively. For easier comparison, the labeling scheme for

the delta-less loop diagrams of Refs. [43, 44] is followed. For the explicit expressions of the
contributions of the delta-less one-loop diagrams in the amplitudes we refer the reader to
Refs. [43, 44]. We have reproduced their results.

Due to the complexity of the spin-3/2 delta propagator, the calculation of the delta-full
loop diagrams in Fig. 3 is much more complicated. All diagrams have been calculated using
two independent computer codes giving identical results. The ﬁnal expressions are much
too huge to be displayed in the paper, however, they can be obtained from the authors.

V. RENORMALIZATION

To calculate the loop diagrams we apply dimensional regularization with d the number
of space-time dimensions. All UV divergences of physical quantities are removed by counter
terms generated by the eﬀective Lagrangian and absorbed in the corresponding LECs. The
ﬁnite pieces of the subtraction terms are ﬁxed such that the subtracted contributions of the
loop diagrams in physical quantities satisfy the power counting. The required counter terms

procedure analogous that of Ref. [57]. The πN scattering amplitudes obtained by using the
EOMS scheme are discussed in the end.

A. Masses and wave function renormalization constants

sions for the pion wave function renormalization constant Zπ and the pion pole mass M 2

where Hπ is a one-loop integral deﬁned in the appendix together with all loop integrals
which contribute in our calculations. Since in dimensional regularization there are no power
counting violating terms from the loops, the renormalization of the pion mass can be treated
in the standard way of mesonic ChPT by taking (cid:96)3 ≡ (cid:96)3R − 3
The case of the nucleon is more complicated and can be done in the EOMS scheme so
that the PCBTs from loops are dealt properly. We also give the renormalization of the delta
mass and the corresponding wave function renormalization constant.

Within the on mass-shell renormalization the renormalized mass of a particle is chosen equal
to the pole position of the corresponding dressed propagator. In case of BChPT, where we
want to keep track of the quark mass dependence of physical quantities explicitly, we use the
EOMS scheme [42], that is we choose the renormalized mass of the nucleon as the pole mass
in the chiral limit. In order to cancel the UV divergence and PCBTs from the loop diagrams,
one needs to split the bare parameters m and c1 in Eq. (46) as speciﬁed by Eq. (40). The
explicit expressions of the counter terms ¯δm, ¯¯δm, ¯δc1 and ¯¯δc1 are given in the Appendix E.

3. Delta

In case of unstable particles the pole of the dressed propagator is located in the complex
plane. We choose the renormalized mass of the delta resonance as the pole position of its
dressed propagator in the chiral limit, that is we apply a generalization of the complex-mass
scheme introduced originally for the Standard Model [59, 60]. Note that the non-trivial issue
of unitarity within the complex-mass scheme has been discussed in Ref. [61] and studied in
more details in Ref. [62].

B. Coupling constants of the leading order interactions

1. Pion decay constant Fπ

For practical convenience, one often needs to replace the quantities in the chiral limit, F ,
gR and hR by the physical ones, Fπ, gπN and gπN ∆, respectively. At one-loop order the pion
decay constant Fπ is given via [19]

2. Pion-nucleon coupling constant gπN

In the isospin limit mu = md = ˆm, where mu and md are the masses of the u and d quarks,
respectively, the matrix element of the pseudoscalar density evaluated between one-nucleon
states can be parameterized as

where g(2),loop
represents the very lengthy loop contribution which is not given explicitly in
this paper but obtainable from the authors (also the loop contributions to gπN ∆ coupling,
discussed below). The coupling gπN is renormalized in the EOMS scheme and we have
checked that the divergences and PCBTs from the loop contributions can indeed be canceled
by counter terms generated by g and d18 − 2d16.

3. Pion-nucleon-delta coupling constant gπN ∆

Following Ref. [64] we deﬁne the “physical” coupling constant gπN ∆ by considering the
pion-nucleon-delta vertex function Γ on the complex mass-shell of the delta. Tree and one-
loop diagrams up to order O(p3) contributing in the πN ∆ vertex function are shown in

gπN ∆(M 2

Diagrams (b) and (c) in Fig. 6 can be absorbed. Hence, the ﬁnal expression of gπN ∆ can be
written as

(57)

with h the redeﬁned parameter (as speciﬁed in Eq. (36)) and g(2),loop
πN ∆ the loop contribution.
Like the renormalization of gπN , UV-divergences and PCBTs are canceled by counter terms
generated by h. As pointed out e.g.
in Ref. [31], the coupling gπN ∆ is a complex-valued
quantity.

C. The πN scattering amplitude

According to the LSZ reduction formula, the πN scattering amplitude TπN is related to

the amputated Greens function ˆTπN , which has been calculated in the above section, via

TπN = ZπZN ¯u(p

(cid:48)

) ˆTπN u(p) ,

(58)

where Zπ and ZN are the wave function renormalization constants of the pion and the
nucleon, respectively.
UV divergences and power counting violating contributions of loop diagrams contributing
to the amplitudes which have to be subtracted are calculated by applying the procedure
outlined in details in Refs. [34, 42]. We do not give the expressions of these subtraction
terms due to their large size. As mentioned above these subtraction terms are canceled by
counter terms generated by parameters of the eﬀective Lagrangian, see Eq. (40) and (41).
After taking into account the contributions of the counter terms, we obtain a ﬁnite amplitude
respecting the power counting and possessing the correct analytic behavior.

Note that while we give the explicit form of the counter terms for c1 in the appendix, the

ones for c2,3,4 are too lengthy to be shown here. However, one can display them as

πN amplitude at one-loop order, such as M , mR, m∆R, F , gR and hR, can be substituted
by their corresponding physical quantities speciﬁed by Eqs. (43), (46), (51), (53), (55) and
(57) as this leads to diﬀerences beyond the accuracy of the current calculation.

VI. PHASE SHIFTS AND THRESHOLD PARAMETERS

Based on the πN scattering amplitudes speciﬁed in the above section, we calculate the
phase shifts and threshold parameters.
In what follows, we ﬁrst determine the unknown
LECs involved in the πN scattering amplitudes by ﬁtting to the phase shifts of the S- and
P -waves. Then we predict the D- and F -wave phase shifts and the threshold parameters
using the determined LECs.

A. Fitting procedure

For the partial wave analysis of the pion-nucleon scattering amplitudes results of several
groups are available: Karlsruhe [65, 66], Matsinos [67] and GWU [45]. Unfortunately, none
of these groups provide uncertainties of their results. Therefore, we prefer to perform ﬁts
to the phase shifts generated by the recent Roy-Steiner-equation analysis (RS) of the πN
scattering [17], where both the central values and the errors of results are given by Schenk-like
or conformal parameterizations. Note that this analysis also includes the most up-to-date
experimental information on the pion-nucleon scattering lengths. For ﬁtting we extract the
RS phase shifts equidistantly from the threshold Wth = 1078 MeV to W = 1318 MeV with
a step-size of 0.8 MeV. Furthermore, at each ﬁxed energy point, the central value of the
phase shift is generated randomly with a normal distribution N (µ, σ), where the mean value
µ and the standard deviation σ are speciﬁed by the results of the RS equation analysis, and
the corresponding error to the central value is assigned to be σ. This procedure generates
a set of simulated data for the chosen energy conﬁguration which is suitable for ﬁtting. In
order to obtain stable values for the LECs one should repeat such a procedure as well as
ﬁtting for a large number of times, which will generate a large number of (central) values
for the LECs and from which the mean values and the statistical errors of the LECs can be
determined. In order to achieve this it is enough in our case to repeat the ﬁtting procedure
100 times. Note that our results are Gaussian and thus in fact any procedure using diﬀerent
ﬁtting approaches would lead to the same central values and error bars. Our interest here is
to obtain a value of the χ2 which has the usual interpretation, namely a good χ2 corresponds
to a value close to 1. For ﬁts done directly using the RS equations a good χ2 would be close
to zero.

In the ﬁtting procedure, two S-waves, S31 and S11 and four P -waves, P31, P11, P33, P13, are
taken into account. We use Eq. (16) to extract the phase shifts for P33 partial wave, where
the Delta resonance is located. For the other partial waves, as discussed in Section II C,
the diﬀerence due to various unitarization procedures appears at higher orders, and we use
Eq. (19). This is especially advantageous for the P11 partial wave, since there is a numerical
problem when using Eq. (16) because the real part of the partial wave amplitude vanishes
for some energy close to the threshold.

There are eleven LECs (or independent combinations of them) involved in the πN ampli-
tudes in total: c1, c2, c3, c4, d1 + d2, d3, d5, d14 − d15, gπN , gπN ∆ and g1. We ﬁx gπN coupling
at the central value of g2
πN /(4π) = 13.69 ± 0.20, which was recently obtained through the
Goldberger-Miyazawa-Oehme sum rule [68, 69]. The renormalized couplings ci=1,2,3,4 and
gπN ∆ are complex due to absorption of complex subtraction terms of loop diagrams. Never-
theless, for convenience, we use real-valued renormalized ci’s in our ﬁtting procedure and the
corresponding imaginary parts of the subtraction terms are retained in the loop contributions

19

rather than absorbed in the ci. As for gπN ∆, we deﬁne

hA = gπN ∆Fπ ,

which is more often used in BChPT and the large-Nc relation yields

hA = (3gA)/2√2 (cid:39) 1.35 ,

with

gA = 1.27 .

(60)

(61)

Note that our notation diﬀers from the one used in Ref. [70] by a factor of 2. Obviously,
hA is also a complex coupling in the calculation up to NNLO. However, one can just choose
the real part Re[hA] as a ﬁtting parameter, and the corresponding imaginary part can be
obtained using Eq. (57). In practice, the involved loop integrals can be calculated with all
the masses being speciﬁed in the next paragraph and hence the imaginary part of hA is given
by (up to higher order corrections)

Im[hA] =

(1.51F 2

π g2

πN − 1.84Re[hA]2) Re[hA]

160F 2

π π2

.

(62)

Thus we are left with ten unknown real ﬁtting parameters.
It is worth noting that hA
appearing in the loop contributions can be substituted by Re[hA] since the diﬀerence caused
is of higher order.

For the masses of the particles and the pion decay constant the following values are
employed throughout our ﬁtting procedure: Mπ = 139 MeV, mN = 939 MeV, z∆ = (1210−
i 50) MeV, Fπ = 92.2 MeV. We take the dimensional regularization scale µ = mN . Here,
z∆ has been identiﬁed as the pole position of the dressed delta propagator with its value
given by PDG [71]. Note that one can use Re[z∆] in the loop contributions instead of z∆
since the diﬀerence caused by this approximation is of higher-order, at least order O(p5).
This substitution guarantees that all arguments of the required loop integrals are real (no
arguments with complex momenta) and, therefore, this enables us to calculate all one-loop
integrals using the programs for numerical evaluation OneLoop [72] and LoopTools [73]. The
ﬁts below were performed using the Fortran package Minuit[74].

B. Results

The ﬁtted LECs for three diﬀerent cases are given in Table I, where the statistical and
systematic uncertainties are shown in the ﬁrst and second brackets behind the central values,
respectively. The systematic uncertainties represent the eﬀects of varying the ﬁtting ranges,
which will be discussed later on in this section. The covariance and correlation matrices
between the LECs are given in Table II. They are calculated using the standard formulae

where xi is the vector of N central values of the LECs obtained from the ﬁtting of our
pseudo-data as explained before, for our case N = 100. There are strong correlations
between some LECs. Results of our ﬁts are displayed and compared with the phase shifts

with Q = ωq/Λb where ωq and Λb are the pion energy in the center-of-mass frame and the
breakdown scale of the chiral expansion, respectively. For the delta-full case, we choose to
employ Λb ∼ 0.6 GeV following Ref. [75], which is lower than the scale of the chiral symmetry
breaking Λχ ∼ 4πFπ ∼ 1 GeV. The lightest particle we do not include explicitly is the Roper
resonance N∗(1440) and its mass diﬀers from the nucleon mass by about 0.5 GeV. Our choice
of Λb is close to that number. Similarly, for the delta-less case, Λb is taken 0.4 GeV due to
the nucleon-delta mass diﬀerence. For more discussions on the choice of Λb see Ref. [76].
Now let us proceed with the details of the three diﬀerent ﬁts.

Ref. [75].

Fit-I corresponds to the delta-less case and is performed up to Wmax=1.11 GeV. This
maximal energy is chosen according to the following criterions: I) the average χ2 per degree
of freedom (χ2/d.o.f) for the 100-times ﬁts is around 1.0, II) the average χ2 increases rapidly
if one takes larger Wmax. For Fit-I, we get results similar to those obtained by ﬁtting to the
phase shifts of partial wave analysis by GWU group up to 1.13 GeV [43, 44]. There exist
slight diﬀerences between our current results and the previous ones [43, 44] due to the fact
that diﬀerent data (RS data versus GWU data) were ﬁtted and the ﬁtting ranges are not
the same. Besides, they have one more ﬁtting parameter d18, which is related to gπN by
making use of the Goldberber-Treiman relation at NNLO. Our plots for Fit-I are shown in
Figure 7. The error bands in P33 and S31 partial waves do not cover the RS and GWU data
beyond the ﬁtting range, which suggests that Λb = 0.4 GeV underestimates the theoretical
errors for these partial waves.

Adding the delta degree of freedom should mostly improve the description of the P33 wave
in the ∆-resonance region. We thus performed two ﬁts (Fit-II and Fit-III) using 1.2 GeV
as Wmax for the P33 partial wave and 1.11 GeV for the other ﬁve partial waves - the same
value as for Fit I. Fit II is done by adding the LO Born-term contribution of the delta-
exchange diagrams to the delta-less case and serves only the purpose of estimating the eﬀect
of the loop diagrams. Our plots for Fit-II are shown in Figure 8. Since only the tree order
contributions of the delta are included, hA is a real parameter and meanwhile g1 does not
show up in Fit-II. Compared to the strategies in Refs. [43, 44], in the current work the
complex pole position of the delta propagator rather than the real mass is incorporated in

a systematic way and hence the eﬀect of the delta width is included explicitly. We obtain
better results with smaller uncertainties than the previous studies, for instance, the large
errors in d14 − d15 are substantially reduced.
Fit-III is done (up to 1.2 GeV for P33 and up to 1.11 GeV for the other waves) with the full
contributions of pions, nucleons and deltas up to NNLO. The obtained LECs of Fit-III are
diﬀerent from those of Fit-II due to the inclusion of contributions of loop diagrams involving
delta lines. Note that all the ci and most of the higher order LECs are of natural size.
Our plots for Fit-III are shown in Figure 9. Compared to the plots in Figure 8, although
both ﬁts describe well the phase shifts in the ﬁtting range, Fit-III improves the predictions
beyond ﬁtting ranges in most of the partial waves, especially for the S11 wave. The larger
theoretical error in Figure 9 compared to Figure 8 is due to the large contributions of delta-
loop diagrams, which are not taken into account in estimation of the theoretical error of
Fit-II using Eq. (64).

As one can see from Table I, the imaginary part of hA from Fit-III is small compared to
the corresponding real part Re[hA] and our determination for Re[hA] is close to the large-Nc
prediction (61). The obtained g1 for Fit-III is nearly consistent (within the error bars) with
the corresponding large-NC result, |g1| = 9gA/5 (cid:39) 2.28. As noted in Ref. [77], g1 appears
only in the loop contribution, hence a precise determination of its value is not to be expected.
All the above three ﬁts are done with their own preferred Wmax. However, following
Ref. [78], one can change those maximal energies around the preferred Wmax and redo the
ﬁts to see the inﬂuence on the obtained LECs. For Fit-I, we made ﬁts with Wmax = 1.11 ±
0.004 GeV, 1.11 ± 0.008 GeV, 1.11 ± 0.012 GeV and 1.11 ± 0.016 GeV in order to produce

such kind of systematic errors to the LECs. For Fit-II and Fit-III, we keep the maximal
energy at 1.2 GeV for the P33 partial wave but vary it for the other waves as is the case for
Fit-I. A demonstration of how to obtain the systematic errors is given in Fig. 10 for the case
of Fit-I and analogous ﬁgures are obtained for other three ﬁts. The obtained systematic
errors to the LECs are shown in the second bracket in Table I.

Note that all the presented ﬁts have been done with the energy steps of 0.8 MeV. We have
checked that the inﬂuence of varying the energy step on the central values of the LECs is
essentially negligible. Also the statistical errors decrease when the ﬁtting range is extended
keeping the energy step the same, see Fig. 10, or more ﬁtting points are added in the same
ﬁtting range. However, we do not estimate such systematic uncertainties here.

Using the LECs obtained by ﬁtting to the phase shifts of S- and P -waves, one can predict
the phase shifts of higher partial waves. In Fig. 11 we show the phase shifts of D and F
partial waves obtained using the parameters of Fit-I and Fit-III compared to the results
obtained by the GWU group [45]. As expected, the predicted phase shifts of higher partial
waves are indeed small. Except for D33 channel, our predictions agree qualitatively with the
GWU results and the predictions of the delta-full theory are somewhat better than those of
the delta-less theory.

Finally, in order to demonstrate how well Eq. (16) extracts phase shifts from perturbative
amplitudes, we draw the so-called Argand plot for the P33 partial wave in Fig. 12 by using
the LECs of Fit-III. In Fig. 12 the red solid and the magenta dashed lines correspond,
respectively, to the full contribution (π+N +∆) and the contribution of the pion and nucleon

improving the unitarity constraints. The unitarized amplitude based on the full contribution
is represented by the blue dotted line, which is located on the unitary circle (broad cyan solid
circle), as expected. The energy corresponding to the 15th point is W15 = 1314 MeV and
the interval between two adjacent points on the same line is 16 MeV. The eﬀect of Eq. (16)
is to move the points of the full NNLO perturbative amplitudes to the closest positions on
the unitary circle.

from the preferred ﬁt with Wmax = 1.11 GeV. The outer (blue) band is yielded by adding the
systematic uncertainty which is generated by the scatter of all results with diﬀerent ﬁtting ranges.
The error bars correspond to statistical errors of the ﬁtting procedure.

C. Scattering lengths and volumes

At low energies, one can predict the threshold parameters based on the above determined
LECs. For the partial wave with angular momentum (cid:96) the general form of the eﬀective range

where p is the three-momentum of the nucleon in CMS frame, a is the threshold parameter
(e.g.

eﬀective range parameter, and vn are the shape parameters. Using Eq. (65) one can obtain
the threshold parameters as

The second equality holds true due to the fact that the imaginary parts of the partial wave
amplitudes vanish faster at threshold. As Ref I

exactly at the threshold we calculated its values for energies very close to the threshold and
then obtained the threshold parameters by extrapolating to the threshold. Results of the
threshold parameters corresponding to the three diﬀerent ﬁts are presented in Table III,

VII. BARYON SIGMA TERMS AND THE STRANGENESS CONTENT OF THE
NUCLEON

Sigma terms are interesting observables and important for understanding the sea-quark
structures of baryons. In particular, for the nucleon there are many studies of the πN σ-
term, e.g., see Refs. [15, 79, 80], and of the strangeness content, see Refs. [81–84] for instance.
A high-precision determination of the σπN was done from RS-equation analysis based on the
improved Cheng-Dashen low-energy theorem and σπN = (59.1 ± 3.5) MeV was reported in
Ref. [15].
In this section we discuss the σπN based on our ﬁtted results obtained above.
In order to estimate the strangeness content of the nucleon, we perform the corresponding
calculation in SU(3) BChPT. As byproducts, the baryon sigma terms are also given.

A.

πN sigma term

The πN sigma term σπN can be obtained from the nucleon mass by applying the

Hellmann-Feynman theorem,

σπN = ˆm

∂mN
∂ ˆm

,

ˆm =

(mu + md)

2

.

(67)

For practical convenience, using the expression of the nucleon mass mN given in Sec-
tion V A 2, one can express σπN as

NLO

where the involved loop integrals have been computed numerically. Notice that the last
term in this expression does not contribute in the calculation of the sigma terms of Fit-I
and Fit-II.

The results for the pion-nucleon sigma term σπN based on the diﬀerent ﬁtting results
in the above section are shown in Table IV, where contributions from diﬀerent orders are
also shown. The error in the ﬁrst bracket is propagated from the uncertainties of the ﬁtted
LECs using Eq. (63). The error in the second bracket is theoretical uncertainty estimated

28

using Eq. (64) and we employ Q = Mπ/Λb with Λb = 400 MeV for the delta-less case and
with Λb = 600 MeV for the delta-full case. Note that here for Fit-II the theoretical error
originating from the delta-loop contribution is also taken into account. For easy comparison,
the recent determination of the pion-nucleon sigma term from the Roy-Steiner equations [15]
is also given.

Our prediction for Fit-I, σπN = 74.8(2.2)(11.4) MeV, is marginally consistent with the
RS determination when the large uncertainties are taken into account. For the delta-full
case with LO delta contribution, applying the same unitarization as in Ref. [80], we obtain
σπN = 60.1(1.6)(6.2) MeV based on Fit-II. On the other hand, by including the explicit
delta width rather than generating it by unitarization as in Ref. [80], we obtained σπN =
57.1(1.9)(7.0) MeV based on Fit-II, which appears to agree with the RS determination very
well. As for Fit-III, our prediction σπN = 68.5(1.9)(7.6) MeV improves the delta-less result
and within the error it overlaps the value of the RS analysis. The large estimated theoretical
error comes from the delta-loop diagram contributions by using Eq. (64).

B. The strangeness content of the nucleon and the sigma terms of baryons from

SU(3) BChPT

Similarly to σπN one can obtain the nucleon expectation value of the operator ms¯ss using

the Hellmann-Feynman theorem,

σsN = ms

∂mN
∂ms

,

(69)

where ms is the mass of the strange quark. However, the nucleon mass mN in the above
equation should be calculated in SU(3) BChPT. We calculated the masses of the baryon
octet in SU(3) BChPT also including the baryon decuplet as explicit degrees of freedom up
to third order. Details of this calculation are speciﬁed in the Appendix F. The other baryon
sigma terms are also obtainable by using formulas similar to Eqs. (67) and (69) but with
the nucleon mass being replaced by mΣ, mΛ or mΞ.

The strangeness content of the nucleon y is deﬁned through

y =

2 ˆm
ms

σsN
σπN

,

(70)

and the nucleon expectation value of the operator ¯uu + ¯dd − 2¯ss (see e.g. [82]) is given by
the following equation

σ0 = σπN (1 − y).

29

(71)

In order to determine the strangeness content of the nucleon and the sigma terms speciﬁed
above, we ﬁrst need to pin down the unknown LECs involved in the SU(3) calculation.
Therefore, we ﬁt to the experimental values for mN , mΣ, mΛ and mΞ (taken from PDG [71])
as well as the RS determination of σπN , as given in the last column of Table IV.2 There
are the following ﬁve unknown LECs: the octet mass in the chiral limit M0, the LECs
corresponding to the NLO mass splitting operators b0, bD and bF , and the LO Goldstone-
boson-octet-decuplet coupling constant C . For the other parameters we use the following
values

D = 0.80, F = 0.46, Mπ = 0.139 GeV, MK = 0.494 GeV,

MB = 1.151 GeV, MD = 1.382 GeV,

(72)

with MB and MD being the averages of the physical masses of the octet and decuplet,
respectively. The mass of the η meson is obtained from the Gell-Mann-Okubo relation:
3M 2

π. Furthermore, Fφ = 1.17Fπ with Fπ = 92.2 MeV is used.

η = 4M 2
We performed two ﬁts:

K − M 2

• Fit A: The octet baryon mass in the loops is ﬁxed at MB, and the mass of the decuplet

baryons to mD.

• Fit B: The octet baryon mass in the loops is set as the chiral limit mass M0, and the

mass of the decuplet baryons to mD.

If the chiral series of the baryon masses and the sigma terms converges well, these two ﬁts
should diﬀer slightly since the diﬀerences are of high order. However, we obtain results
with sizable diﬀerences (see y and σ0 together with the ﬁtted parameters in Table V) which
implies that the higher-order contributions are large. Only when the theoretical errors,
which is due to the truncation of the chiral series using Eq. (64) with Q = Mπ/Λχ, are
taken into account, these ﬁt results overlap. The previous determinations are as follows:
y = 0.15(10) and σ0 = 33(5) of the NLO calculation [81], y = 0.21(20) and σ0 = 36(7) of
the NNLO calculation within HBChPT [82], y = 0.02(23) and σ0 = 58(8) of the NNLO
calculation within Covariant BChPT [83]. We therefore conclude that to this order in the
chiral expansion, one is not able to make a precise statement about the strangeness content
of the nucleon. Likewise, various values of y calculated either directly in Lattice QCD, or
indirectly using the octet baryon masses and sigma terms obtained in Lattice QCD, are very
diﬀerent. Therefore we do not compare to those results.

We also predict the octet baryon masses and sigma terms in Table VI and Table VII,
respectively. The errors for the masses and the ones in the ﬁrst brackets for the sigma terms
are propagated from the uncertainties of the LECs. For the sigma terms we also estimated
the theoretical errors, which are shown in the second brackets in Table VII. As we can see,
the theoretical errors for σsN are very large due to the bad convergence of the chiral series in
SU(3) BChPT. Note also that determinations of σsN by diﬀerent Lattice QCD collaborations
vary in a large range, see e.g. Refs [85–94].

2 Note that the experimental error, as speciﬁed in PDG, for mΛ is extremely small and we assign an error
of 0.1 MeV to mΛ in our ﬁtting program in order to balance the χ2 contribution with those originating
from the other masses.

VIII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

In this paper we presented the O(p3) order calculation of the pion-nucleon scattering
amplitudes in the framework of BChPT including pions, nucleons and deltas as explicit
degrees of freedom. There are tree and one-loop diagrams contributing at this order. We
applied the EOMS renormalization scheme to loop diagrams involving pion and nucleon lines
only. For diagrams with the delta lines in loops we used the complex-mass scheme which is
a generalization of the on-mass-shell scheme for unstable particles. That is we subtracted

the divergent pieces and the power counting violating contributions of the loop diagrams by
canceling them by counter terms generated by splitting the bare parameters of the eﬀective
Lagrangian in renormalized couplings and counter terms.

We ﬁtted the renormalized coupling constants to the S- and P -wave phase shifts, which
are randomly generated by using the results of the Roy-Steiner equation analysis of Ref. [17]
and hence are normally distributed simulations. Both the phase shifts extracted from the
RS equation analysis and the GWU group analysis [45] are well described up to 1.11 GeV
for the delta-less case. For the delta-full case, the P33 partial wave is ﬁtted up to 1.20 GeV
while the other partial waves up to 1.11 GeV.

Based on the obtained LECs, we predicted the D- and F -wave phase shifts and compared
them with the results given by the GWU group. We found that our prediction for D33 wave
diﬀers from the determination of the GWU group while the predictions for other D and F
waves agree well. Considering the Argand plot for the P33 partial wave we checked that the
unitarized amplitude, from which we extracted the phase shifts, is a good approximation to
the amplitude obtained by our perturbative calculation. At low energies, we extracted the
threshold parameters and compared to the corresponding results of the Roy-Steiner equation
analysis obtaining satisfactory agreement.

In addition, we calculated the pion-nucleon sigma term. Our extractions of σπN based
on the ﬁtted LECs of Fit-I and Fit-III are consistent with the result of RS analysis σπN =
(59.1 ± 3.5) MeV taking into account the large errors of our determination.
In the end, we also studied the strangeness content of the nucleon y in SU(3) BChPT. We
ﬁrst ﬁxed all the involved SU(3) LECs by ﬁtting to the experimental octet baryon masses
as well as the RS result σπN = (59.1 ± 3.5) MeV [15]. Two diﬀerent strategies were used.
In principle, they should only slightly diﬀer from each other since the diﬀerences are due
to higher-order contributions. However, because of the bad convergence properties of the
SU(3) BChPT for these quantities, we obtained two sets of predictions with rather large
discrepancies from each other. Nevertheless, when the large uncertainties are taken into
account, they are consistent with each other. Hence at the order one is working here, we
unfortunately cannot disentangle a small from a large value of y. Similar picture appears
when one takes an overall view on the previous determinations from BChPT [81–83] and
Lattice QCD [85–95]. Within these two strategies, we predict all the octet baryon sigma
terms as well.

Appendix B: Redeﬁnition of the LECs

For simplicity, the following abbreviations are used:

∆(b3,b8,f1,f2) ≡ 2mY(b3, b8) + ∆23Σ23Y(f1, f2).

Σ23 = m + m∆,

(B1)
In order to absorb the non-pole parts of the contributions of the O(p2) and O(p3) order
delta-exchange diagrams, the following redeﬁnition of the LECs in the contact terms are
needed

Y(a, b) ≡ 2am + bΣ23,

In general, all LECs generate counter terms in the EOMS scheme as follows:

¯δY
16π2F 2 R ,

Y ∈ {(cid:96)3, (cid:96)4, d1 + d2, d3, d5, d14 − d15, d18 − 2d16} .

We have derived all counter terms explicitly and most of them turn out to be too lengthy to
be shown here. Hence, we only show the counter terms for the parameters involved in the
nucleon and delta mass renormalization.

Appendix F: One loop contributions in the baryon octet self energy

We use the deﬁnitions and notations of Ref.

[97] and the LO meson-octet-decuplet
interaction term is taken from Ref. [82] with the coupling constant C . Contact interaction
and one loop diagrams contributing to the octet masses are shown in Fig. 4 a), where the
solid, dashed and double lines correspond to the octet brayons, mesons and the decuplet
baryons, respectively.

The contributions of NLO contact interactions to the octet baryon masses can be found
[97] and the one loop order contributions to the octet self energy are speciﬁed

e.g. in Ref.

37

oct corresponds to the diagram with octet baryon propagators in the loop and Σab

We renormalize these loop contributions by applying the EOMS scheme without expanding
in powers of mD − mB, i.e. we expand in powers of the meson masses and absorb terms of
order zero in the renormalization of the mass in the chiral limit and the order two terms
in the renormalization of contact interactions. We checked that this renormalization indeed
can be carried out self-consistently.
