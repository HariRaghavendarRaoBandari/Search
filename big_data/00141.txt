We show that the soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsars
(AXPs) can be explained as recently proposed highly magnetized white dwarfs (B-WDs).
The radius and magnetic ﬁeld of B-WDs are perfectly adequate to explain energies in
SGRs/AXPs as the rotationally powered energy. While the highly magnetized neutron
stars require an extra, observationally not well established yet, source of energy, the
magnetized white dwarfs, yet following Chandrasekhar’s theory (C-WDs), exhibit large
ultra-violet luminosity which is observationally constrained from a strict upper limit.

Keywords: white dwarfs; stars: magnetars; stars: magnetic ﬁeld; gravitation; relativity

1. Introduction

Soft gamma repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) are, as of
now, most popularly hypothesized as isolated, spinning down, highly magnetized
neutron stars (NSs) (magnetar model) 1. A NS of radius 10km with surface and
central magnetic ﬁelds respectively Bs ∼ 1014G and Bc ∼ 1016G can have magnetic
energy ∼ 1048erg, which could produce the luminosity ∼ 1036erg/sec, as observed
for AXPs/SGRs, in its typical age. However, there are certain shortcomings in
it. First of all, as of now, there is no evidence for a strongly magnetized NS —
as strong as required for the magnetar model. Second, recent Fermi observations
are inconsistent with predicted high energy gamma-ray emissions in the magnetars.
Third, inferred upper limit of Bs for some magnetars, e.g. SGR 0418+5729, is quite
smaller than the ﬁeld required to explain observed X-ray luminosity. Fourth, the
attempt to relate magnetars to the energies of supernova remnants or the formation
of black holes is not viable. There are many more. These observations imply that
the high magnetic dipole moment is not a mandatory condition for a magnetar.

Recently AXPs/SGRs have been argued 2 to be magnetized white dwarfs (WDs),
following the idea proposed decades back 3,4. Due to their larger radius, the rota-
tionally powered energy for WDs could be quite larger than that for NSs. Hence,
these authors attempted to explain the energy released in AXPs/SGRs through the
occurrence of glitch and subsequent loss of the rotational energy. While this WD
based model (hereinafter C-WD) does not need to invoke extraordinarily strong,
unconﬁrmed observationally yet, magnetic ﬁeld, it is challenged by the observed
short spin periods (e.g. Ref. 5).
In addition, due to larger radius, they should
exhibit larger ultra-violet (UV) luminosities, which however, suﬀer from a deep up-

per limits on the optical counterparts (e.g. Refs. 5, 6) of some AXPs/SGRs, e.g.
SGR 0418+5729.

Recently, Mukhopadhyay and his collaborators, in a series of papers, have pro-
posed for the existence of highly magnetized WDs (see, e.g., Refs. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11)
with mass signiﬁcantly super-Chandrasekhar. Bs of such WDs could be as high as
1012G and Bc could be 2 − 3 orders of magnitude higher. These WDs (hereinafter
B-WDs) are signiﬁcantly smaller in size compared to their ordinary counterparts
(e.g. polar with Bs ∼ 109G). Their radius could even be an order or order and
half of magnitude higher than that of a NS. As the surface temperatures of WDs
with diﬀerent magnetic ﬁelds are not expected to diﬀer signiﬁcantly 12, smaller the
radius, smaller the luminosity of the WD is. Therefore, B-WDs should be consis-
tent with the UV-luminosity (LU V ) cut-oﬀ in AXPs/SGRs. Moreover, their typical
Bs is consistent with observations, but adequate to explain AXP/SGR energies as
rotationally/spin-down powered energy, unlike the NS based models and C-WDs.

Here we explore AXPs/SGRs as B-WDs. Although the evolution of B-WDs
was argued by accretion, they may appear as AXPs/SGRs at the exhaustion of
mass supply after signiﬁcant evolution. Such WDs’ Bs and R combination can
easily explain AXPs/SGRs as rotationally powered WDs. All the machineries im-
plemented in the magnetar model can be applicable for B-WDs as well, however,
with a smaller Bs which is physically more viable. Hence, under the B-WD model,
one does not necessarily need to invoke an extra-ordinarily source of magnetic en-
ergy — everything comes out naturally. We also show that the magnetic ﬁelds in
B-WDs are in accordance with the virial theorem, subject to its modiﬁcation based
on the magnetic pressure in the magnetostatic condition.

2. Modelling magnetized white dwarfs as rotating dipoles

The rate of energy loss from an oscillating magnetic dipole is

˙Erot = −

µ0Ω4 sin4 α

5πc3

|m|2,

(1)

when the variation of dipole moment m arises due to a magnetic dipole having
inclination angle α with respect to its rotational axis, Ω is the angular frequency of
the dipole, c the light speed. Assuming the rotating, magnetized compact stars to
be rotating magnetic dipole, the dipole nature of magnetic ﬁeld is expressed as

when R is the radius of star. However, the above energy loss rate can be deﬁned as
the rate of rotational kinetic energy change of star with moment of inertia I as

B =

µ0|m|
2πR3 ,

(2)

which leads to

when P is the rotational period and ˙P the period derivative, I = M k2, M the mass
of the compact star. Note that k ∝ R and the proportionality constant depends on
the nature of the matter and its distribution in the star and shape of the star. This
is the upper limit of Bs. As P and ˙P for AXPs/SGRs are known from observations,
Bs can be computed for a given mass-radius (M −R) relation when α is a parameter.
Once Bs is estimated for an observation, the rotational/dipole energy Erot stored
in the star can be computed. This further quantiﬁes the maximum energy stored
in it, if there is no other source as adopted in the magnetar model.

3. Explaining AXPs/SGRs

We consider nine AXPs/SGRs explained as B-WDs, listed in Table 1. We also
assume the surface temperature of WDs to be TU V ∼ 104 K with WDs to be
semi-solid sphere/ellipsoid.

Figures 1a and 1b show that Bs for the M −R combination of the B-WDs is quite
stronger compared to that of the C-WDs. Also B-WDs exhibit X-ray luminosity:
100 . ˙Erot/Lx . 107, from Eq. (1), explaining all the AXPs/SGRs listed in Table 1
as rotational powered pulsars.

This naturally explains AXPs/SGRs without requiring an extra-ordinary source
of magnetic energy. Generally, higher the Bcand/orBs for a poloidal dominated
ﬁeld, higher the M is, which corresponds to a lower R and hence a lower LU V .

4. Maximum allowed magnetic ﬁeld and modiﬁed virial theorem

First note very importantly that in the presence of strong magnetic ﬁeld, the upper
limit of magnetic ﬁelds in WDs, as discussed in, e.g. Ref. 13 for weak ﬁeld cases, has
to be revised, the contribution of the magnetic pressure to the hydro/magnetostatic
balance equation cannot be neglected. Here we attempt to revise so in a sim-
pler/approximate framework.

If the gravitational, thermal and magnetic energies are respectively denoted by

W , Π and µ, then the scalar virial theorem can be read as

W + 3Π + µ = 0,

where we consider, on average, the isotropic eﬀects of averaged magnetic ﬁeld B
and hence overall the star to be spherical in shape, P is the pressure of the stellar
matter, ρ the averaged density, M the mass of WD, G the Newton’s gravitation
constant. Now we assume that a polytropic equation of state (EoS) to be satisﬁed
in entire star such that P = KρΓ, where K and γ are the polytropic constants, and

Now in order to obtain the value of M and R explicitly, we have to evaluate the

at an arbitrary radius r from the center of the star with mass enclosed at that

the variation of B to be a power law like such that the corresponding magnetic
pressure PB = K1ρΓ

An important outcome here is that α is related to the scaling of B with ρ, which
is indeed expected from the magnetostatic balance Eq. (8). In other words, the
presence of magnetic pressure allows either a massive or/and smaller star. Ob-
viously, for Γ = Γ1 the result reduces to that of the nonmagnetic case with the
redeﬁnition K.

Following Refs. 13, 2, the upper bound of B for a gravitationally bound star

reported in Refs. 7, 8, in order to satisfy Eq. (7), Γ1 has to be 1.2029. Similarly,

for the case of M = 1.77 solar mass, equatorial R = 956.14km, Bc = 5.34 × 1014G,
with Γ ≈ 4/3 (Ref. 11), Γ1 has to be 3.5589. Importantly, P (ρ) proﬁle and, hence,
Γ is determined by PB(ρ) proﬁle, which however has not been strictly followed in
this approximate calculation.

5. Conclusions

The present work indicates a possibility of wide application of recently proposed
B-WDs in modern astrophysics. The idea that AXPs/SGRs need sources of energy
other than rotational or accretion is certainly inevitable, but the hypothesis that
they are highly magnetic NSs, although attractive, did not neatly ﬁt in with further
observations (unlike other ideas in Astrophysics, like, spinning NSs as radio pulsars
and accreting compact objects as X-ray binaries, which quickly established them-
selves as paradigms). Hence, it is very important that other possible explanations
for the AXP/SGR phenomena need to be seriously explored. The B-WD concept
is an extremely attractive alternate for AXPs/SGRs.
