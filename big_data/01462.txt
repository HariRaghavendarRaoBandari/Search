A new asymptotic expansion series

for the constant pi

S. M. Abrarov∗ and B. M. Quine∗†

February 28, 2016

Abstract

In our recent publications we have introduced the incomplete co-
sine expansion of the sinc function for eﬃcient application in sam-
pling [Abrarov & Quine, Appl. Math. Comput., 258 (2015) 425-435;
Abrarov & Quine, J. Math. Research, 7 (2) (2015) 163-174]. Here
we show that it can also be utilized as a ﬂexible and eﬃcient tool
in mathematical analysis. In particular, an application of the incom-
plete cosine expansion of the sinc function leads to expansion series of
the error function in form of a sum of the Gaussian functions. This
approach in integration provides a new asymptotic formula for the
constant π.

Keywords: sinc function, error function, Gaussian function, asymp-
totic expansion, constant pi

Due to its unique properties the sinc function is widely used in many appli-
cations in Applied Mathematics and Computational Physics. In particular,
it can be applied in the Fourier analysis, numerical integration and diﬀeren-
tiation [3].

Vieta discovered a remarkable identity showing that the sinc function can

be expressed as an inﬁnite product [1, 2]

The inﬁnite product (2) can be represented in form

and because of the limit

we can infer that

∞(cid:89)

n=1

Consequently, the inﬁnite product (2) can be truncated as

Although such a ﬁnite product of the cosine functions looks attractive for
numerical integration, this form of the sinc approximation is not always con-
venient in practical applications since in many circumstances it is quite dif-
ﬁcult to handle an integrand with product of the cosines. However, due to a
product-to-sum identity that we have introduced in our previous publication

such a problem in truncation may be very eﬀectively resolved. Speciﬁcally,
substituting the product-to-sum identity (3) into the Vieta’s inﬁnite product
(2) yields the following limit

sinc (x) = lim

The truncation of this equation to an integer 2M−1 leads to the approxi-
mation based on the incomplete cosine expansion of the sinc function [5, 6]

(5)

Since the right side of this approximation is a sum of the cosine functions, it
is periodic and, therefore, valid in the interval −2M−1π ≤ x ≤ 2M−1π near
the origin.

As we have shown already, the upper limit in the incomplete cosine ex-
pansion of the sinc function may not be restricted by value 2M−1 only [6]. It
can also be extended to an arbitrary integer L. Such a transition from 2M−1
to an arbitrary value L can be shown by using the relation

and then by making change of the variable L = 2M−1 in the equation (4)
that results in

.

(6)

The presence of the limit (6) signiﬁes that if the integer L is large enough,
then it can be taken as an arbitrary integer leading to the following approx-
imation [6] (see also equation (A.1) in the preprint version of Ref. [5])

(7)

Similar to equation (5) this form of the incomplete cosine expansion of the
sinc function is valid within the range −πL ≤ x ≤ πL as the right side of the

3

equation (7) is a periodic function. Thus, we can consider the approximation
(7) as a more generalized form of the incomplete cosine expansion (5) of the
sinc function. Particularly, comparing equations (5) and (7) with each other
one can see that the approximation (5) is a just speciﬁc case that occurs at
L = 2M−1.

The application of the incomplete cosine expansion (7) of the sinc function
is ﬂexible and, therefore, eﬃcient in numerical integration. In our previous
publications we have shown that the incomplete cosine expansion of the sinc
function can be eﬀective in sampling [5, 6]. However, the sampling is not
the only possibility where it can be very useful. In this work we show that
application of the incomplete cosine expansion of the sinc function can also
be used as a ﬂexible tool for mathematical analysis. Speciﬁcally, using the
incomplete cosine expansion of the sinc function we can derive a new asymp-
totic expansion series for the constant π.

2 Results and discussion

2.1 The error function

The most common form of deﬁnition of the error function is given by [7, 8]

z(cid:90)

erf (z) =

2√
π

e−t2dt,

(8)

where z = x + iy is the complex argument. The error function belongs to
a family of special functions that sometimes regarded as the Faddeeva func-
tions. This family of special functions includes the complex error function
also known as the Faddeeva function [5, 9]

In general, the argument z = x + iy of the error function is complex.
However, in this paper we imply that its imaginary part y of the argument
z is zero. Therefore, we only use the notation erf (x) signifying that x ∈ R
is always real.

There is a remarkable integral of the error function (see integral 12 on

page 4 in [12])

Further we will use this integral to approximate the error function in form
of the Gaussian expansion series.

2.2 Derivation

There are many elegant expansions for the constant π have been published
in the modern literature [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. Signiﬁcant part of the recent
developments in this ﬁeld is related to the Ramanujan-type expansion series
[16, 17, 18]. Nowadays, more than 12 trillion digits of pi have been computed.
Here we derive a new asymptotic expansion series for the constant π by using
the incomplete cosine expansion (7) of the sinc function.

We may attempt to substitute the approximation (7) for the sinc function

into the integral (9) in order to approximate the error function

(cid:19)
(cid:125)

However, since right side of the approximation (7) is periodic, we have to
justify that such a substitution is possible.
As it has been mentioned above, the sinc function (1) can be approxi-
mated by the incomplete cosine expansion (7) only within the range −πL ≤
x ≤ πL near the origin. This can be seen from the Fig. 1 showing the incom-
plete cosine expansion (black curve) and the original sinc function (shadowed
blue curve). For the speciﬁc example L = 15 shown in the Fig. 1 the cor-
responding range where the incomplete cosine expansion coincides with the
original sinc function is −47.1239 ≤ x ≤ 47.1239 since π × 15 ≈ 47.1239. As
we can see from this ﬁgure, due to periodicity the incomplete cosine expan-
sion (7) cannot approximate the original sinc function beyond this speciﬁed
range.

According to Milone et al. [19], an integral of kind

e−t2f (t) dt,

∞(cid:90)

∞(cid:90)

where f (t) is a bounded function, can be approximated as

e−t2f (t) dt ≈

(11)

−6

retaining high accuracy since e−t2 very rapidly decreases when |t| > 6 eﬀec-
tively damping such a way the entire integrand to zero. From the relation
(11) it immediately follows that for a bounded function g (xt)

or

We can see now that despite periodicity, the approximation (10) can be
valid when the incomplete cosine expansion coincides with the original sinc
function in the interval 0 ≤ x t ≤ 12 since all other range is eﬀectively
damped to zero due to presence of the multiplier e−t2/4 and, therefore, do
not contribute for integration. Consequently, if the condition

πL ≥ 12x

(12)

is satisﬁed, then periodicity of the incomplete cosine expansion (7) of the
sinc function can be ignored in substitution into the approximation (10).

Each integral term on the right side of equation (10) is integrable. Conse-
quently, once the condition (12) is satisﬁed, integration of the equation (10)
leads to the error function approximation in form of the Gaussian expansion
series

also shown for comparison. As we can see from this ﬁgure the curves tend
to zero earlier and faster with decreasing L. This can be readily explained
since the criterion (12) is violated stronger at smaller values of the integer L
and larger values of the argument x.

It should be noted that because of the criterion (12) the error function
approximation (13) can cover accurately only a central part near the origin.
This problem, however, can be resolved since the computational test shows
that erf (x > 6) and erf (x < −6) are practically equal to 1 and −1, respec-
tively. Consequently, we can cover the entire range x ∈ (−∞,∞) by using
the following approximation

for comparison.

Consider the following integral (see integral 1 on page 7 in [12])

e−t2erf (t) dt =

√

π
4

(erf (a))2.

From the deﬁnition (8) for the error function it is not diﬃcult to see that
erf (∞) = 1. Consequently, by stretching a to inﬁnity we can rewrite this
integral as an identity for the square root of pi

e−t2erf (t) dt.

(14)

Since the error function is a bounded function −1 ≤ erf (x) ≤ 1, then,
according to Milone et al. [19], we can write

and since the argument t in the integrand varies from 0 to 6, the criterion
(12) for this case can be written as

πL ≥ 12 × 6.

Thus, we have reached an important result; we estimate a smallest value of
the integer L to be equal to 12× 6/π ≈ 23 at which we can ignore periodicity
of the incomplete cosine expansion (7) of the sinc function. Assuming now
that the integer L ≥ 23, the substitution of the error function approximation
(13) into identity (14) provides

(15)

Since L2 >> 1, we can simply ignore −4(cid:96) + 1 in the denominator due to
vanishing contribution. Consequently, we obtain the asymptotic expansion
series for the constant π

L(cid:88)

(cid:96)=1

π ≈ 4L

(cid:96)2 + L2 .

(16)

The expansion series (15) and (16) are asymptotic because they both
converge to the constant π as the integer L approaches to inﬁnity. To the
best of our knowledge the asymptotic formulas (15) and (16) for computing
the constant π have never been reported in scientiﬁc literature. Perhaps these
asymptotic formulas may be grouped as a special kind of expansions due to
their speciﬁc feature - the presence of an arbitrarily large integer L >> 1
that is involved in each summation term in computing pi.

10

There is an easier way to derive the asymptotic series (15) and (16). Since

the equation (6) is exact, its substitution into identity (9) yields

simplify the limit (19) as given by

(20)

Truncating now the equations (19) and (20) we obtain the asymptotic
expansion series (15) and (16), respectively, for the constant pi. Although this
way of derivation is straightforward, it does not explain why the limits (19)
and (20) can be truncated for computation of π if the ﬁnite value of the integer
L signiﬁes an appearance of the periodicity on right side of the equation (17).
Furthermore, this derivation also does not provide an estimated value for a
smallest L at which the periodicity can be ignored. Therefore, the initial
derivation discussed earlier in this section is more informative and preferable.

2.3 Sample computations

In this section we represent some examples of approximated constant pi and
compare them with the reference

π = 3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841 . . . .

We performed all computational tests by using Wolfram Mathematica 9 in
enhanced precision mode in order to demonstrate how many digits can coin-
cide with the reference at some given L.

As we have found the estimated value for the smallest integer, it would be
reasonable to start computation of the constant pi at L = 23. Substitution
shows that even with this small integer the equation (15) provides a number
where four digits coincide with the reference

7501835074959226730514058333 . . . .

However, with same integer the equation (16) cannot compute properly. In
particular, the result of computation is

π ≈ 3(cid:124)(cid:123)(cid:122)(cid:125)

where only ﬁrst digit coincides with the reference. Such a low accuracy occurs
due to simpliﬁcation we made by excluding −4(cid:96) + 1 terms in denominator of
the equation (16) under assumption that L is large. As a result, when L is
relatively small, say below 104, we should not expect a close approximation
for pi.

of three digits separated by a single non-coinciding digit 0. Furthermore, the
non-coinciding digit 0 is smaller than the actual digit 1 by one.

As we can see, the thirteen digits coincide with the reference. However, with
same integer, the equation (16) again shows unusual behavior; the digits
coinciding with the reference consist of two groups of six digits separated by
a single non-coinciding digit.

We also note that this non-coinciding digit 1 between two groups is smaller
than the corresponding actual digit 2 by one.

Further increase of the integer up to L = 109 in the equation (15) yields
further improvement in accuracy revealing 19 coinciding digits with the ref-
erence

Speciﬁcally, it yields a value consisting of two groups of nine coinciding digits
where a single non-coinciding digit 2 separating these two groups is smaller
than the actual digit by one.

Lastly, the computational test we performed at L = 1012 reveals a rapid

convergence in the equation (15)

π ≈ 3.141592653589793238462643

since there are 25 digits that coincide with the reference. Once again, the

showing two groups of coinciding digits with 12 digits in each group. These
two groups of coinciding digits are separated by non-coinciding digit 8 that
is smaller than the actual digit 9 by one.

Although the equation (15) is not as simple as the equation (16), the
computational test we performed shows that it is essentially more rapid in
convergence. Consequently, the asymptotic expansion series (15) is the main
result of this work. This application demonstrates that the incomplete cosine
expansion of the sinc function that we have introduced earlier for sampling
[5, 6], can also be used as a ﬂexible and eﬃcient tool in mathematical analysis.

3 Conclusion

We show that the incomplete cosine expansion of the sinc function can be
used as a ﬂexible and eﬃcient tool in mathematical analysis. Speciﬁcally, its
application for the error function leads to the expansion series consisting of
a sum of the Gaussian functions. Such an approach in integration provides
a new asymptotic formula for the constant π. The computational test we
performed shows a rapid convergence of the proposed asymptotic formula
(15). In particular, at integer L equal to 103, 106, 109 and 1012 it provides
respectively 7, 13, 19 and 25 coinciding digits with the reference value of π.
