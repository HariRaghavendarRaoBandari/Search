We propose a protocol for creating a fully entangled GHZ-type state of neutral atoms in spatially
separated optical atomic clocks. In our scheme, local operations make use of the strong dipole-dipole
interaction between Rydberg excitations, which give rise to fast and reliable quantum operations
involving all atoms in the ensemble. The necessary entanglement between distant ensembles is me-
diated by single-photon quantum channels and collectively enhanced light-matter couplings. These
techniques can be used to create the recently proposed quantum clock network based on neutral
atom optical clocks. We speciﬁcally analyze a possible realization of this scheme using neutral Yb
ensembles.

The current record in clock accuracy is held by yt-
terbium and strontium clocks [1], capable of reaching
∼ 10−18 fractional frequency stability [2, 3]. Apart from
the enormous amount of eﬀort and innovation, the un-
precedented precision and accuracy were attainable due
to the large number of clock atoms (103−104) [4]. Super-
stable clocks enable evaluation of the systematic fre-
quency shift of atomic transitions with less avergaging
time, which is important to measure fast transients, e.g.
gravitational waves and passing dark-matter clumps [5].
In our recent work [6], we showed that a quantum net-
work of atomic clocks can result in substantial boost of
the overall precision if multiple clocks are connected in
quantum entanglement. The proposed globally entangled
state, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, is more
sensitive to the global phase evolution of the clock atoms,
thus allows for an improved measurement of the passage
of time. If the GHZ state is set up and interrogated in the
optimal way [7, 8], frequency measurements can asymp-
totically reach the Heisenberg limit [9], associated with
the total number of atoms in the entire network. Sig-
niﬁcant noise reduction has recently been demonstrated
with spin-squeezed states in a single ensemble of atoms
[10]. Eﬀorts are being made to make both the non-local
[11] and local entanglement distribution [12, 13] faster
and more reliable. Of particular interest are applications
of these ideas to neutral atom clocks.

In this Letter, we show how a non-local GHZ state
can be created across multiple, spatially separated neu-
tral atom clocks with high ﬁdelity. Our protocol relies on
strong Rydberg blockade for enhancing local atom-atom
interaction, collective excitations for enhancing photon-
atom interaction, and single photon quantum channels
for reliable remote connections. We propose and ana-
lyze a realization using neutral Yb ensembles, suitable
for the current atomic clock technology. We predict that
thousands of atoms can be entangled to give an overall

FIG. 1.
(Color online) Schematic of the setup. K clocks,
each holding M atomic ensembles of size n are connected.
Atoms within each ensemble get entangled using long-range
interaction between Rydberg atoms, ensembles in the same
clock are entangled either via Rydberg interactions or via the
cavity mode, while neighboring clocks are entangled through
single-photon quantum channels, enhanced by optical cavi-
ties. The resulting state is a global GHZ state, |0(cid:105)⊗N +|1(cid:105)⊗N

stability increase of more than an order of magnitude,
compared to non-entangled clock networks. We empha-
size that our protocol, although presented to be used for
a network, can also be applied to a single ensemble.

We describe our protocol for K identical atomic clocks
arranged in a sequence, each connected to its neigh-
bors with optical channels, and each using M n identical
atoms, trapped in a magic-wavelength optical lattice, dis-
tributed in M ensembles, illustrated on Fig. 1. We use
the atomic levels, shown on Fig. 2(a) for our protocol:
The two levels of the clock transition, g, f , a metastable
shelving level s, an excited level e, which spontaneously
decays to g, and two strongly interacting Rydberg levels,
r1 and r2. We further require transitions between levels,
marked with arrows, to be driven independently.

We imagine preparing all atoms in the ground state g,
after which our protocol consists of ﬁve subsequent steps.
First, using blockade, we create two independent collec-
tive excitations in one ensemble in each clock, using two
separate atomic levels (f and s). Second, each excited
ensemble emits single photon pulses that are entangled
with one of these collective excitations. Third, the pho-

tons are sent towards the neighboring atomic clocks, and
measured with a linear optics setup in Bell-basis. Fourth,
upon success, each clock performs a local CNOT opera-
tion to connect the two collective excitations. The result
is a set of K entangled collective excitations, one in the
ﬁrst ensemble of each clock, which serve as ”seeds” for a
global GHZ state. In the ﬁfth, and ﬁnal, step the clocks
locally ”grow” a GHZ state out of each seed, extending it
to all atoms in the clock, and thus a global GHZ state is
obtained. In the following, we provide detailed descrip-
tion and analysis of these ﬁve steps, discuss the speciﬁc
realization in Yb atoms and analyze the most important
sources of imperfections and errors.

Our scheme makes use of the Rydberg blockade, which
is a result of the interaction arising between atoms ex-
cited to Rydberg states in an ensemble. If driven reso-
nantly, the ﬁrst excited atom blocks the transition of a
second one, thus at most one atom can get coherently
excited to the Rydberg state [14–16], allowing precise
quantum control. Rydberg blockade has been proposed
as an eﬃcient tool to realize quantum gates and perform
quantum information processing [13, 17–21]. Eﬃcient
control requires the atoms to reside within the blockade
radius of the Rydberg atom. Diﬀerent ways of trapping
and manipulating Rydberg states are currently under in-
vestigation both experimentally [22–26] and theoretically
[27–29].

[π/(2

In the ﬁrst step, we make use of the Rydberg block-
ade to create a superposition of one and zero excitation in
both f and s levels, following the approach of [13, 14, 17].
This is done by performing the following sequence of driv-
ing pulses:
n)]g,r1,
[π]f,r1, shown in Fig. 2(a), where [φ]a,b stands for a pulse
with total, single-atom Rabi phase φ between level a and
b. Starting from the state |g(cid:105)⊗n =: |0(cid:105), this pulse se-
quence creates the state
(1 + f†)(1 + s†)|0(cid:105) =:

(cid:16)|0f(cid:105) + |1f(cid:105)(cid:17)(cid:16)|0s(cid:105) + |1s(cid:105)(cid:17)

where f† and s† are creation operators of the two (ap-
proximately) independent spin wave modes, supported
by the two levels f and s.

In the second step, spin-photon entangled states, using
the spin wave modes f and s, are created, based on an
extended version of the scheme described in [30] and col-
lective enhancement. Each spin-photon entangled state is
√
created by the pulse sequence shown in Fig. 2(b), involv-
ing [π]s,r2, [π/
n]g,r1, [π]e,r1, [π]s,r2. With additional
pulses applied before and after this sequence ﬂipping be-
tween 0f ↔ 1f , 0s ↔ 1s and swapping f and s waves,
and proper timing, this is repeated four times to produce
four time-bin separated light pulses, which are entangled
with the two spin waves,

(cid:16)|0f(cid:105)|t2(cid:105) + |1f(cid:105)|t4(cid:105)(cid:17)(cid:16)|0s(cid:105)|t1(cid:105) + |1s(cid:105)|t3(cid:105)(cid:17)

where |tj(cid:105)|tk(cid:105) is a two photon state with photons emitted
at times tj and tk.

ment. (a) Pulse sequence used to initialize the spin-waves f
and s in an ensemble. (b) Pulse sequence inducing a condi-
tional photon emission, the emitted photon becomes entan-
gled with the spin state s.
(c) In three steps, neighboring
ensembles generate pairwise entanglement between their col-
lective excitations. First, they induce 0 + 1 superpositions
of the two independent spin waves, f† and s†. Then apply-
ing the conditional photon emission sequence four times, they
emit four pulses, containing two photons total. Each pair of
photons is correlated with a unique spin state. Finally, pho-
tons are measured with a linear optics setup, and 2-photon
coincidences indicate the creation of entanglement between
neighboring ensembles. (Blue and red shadings indicate pos-
itive and negative correlation between qubits, respectively.)

In the third step, pairs of time-bin encoded photon
pulses from two neighboring ensembles are detected by
interfering the two pulses on a beam splitter and mea-
suring two-photon coincidences [31–33]. As a result, en-
tangled states between neighboring atomic ensembles, k
and k + 1, are created [34, 35],

|0s(cid:105)k|1f(cid:105)k+1 ± |1s(cid:105)k|0f(cid:105)k+1,

(3)

where the individual kets represent the states of f and s
spin waves in the two ensembles, see Fig. 2(c).

In the fourth step, the ensembles perform a local
CNOT operation on the two collective degrees of free-
dom, f† and s†. This is done with the following pulse se-

on Fig. 3(a), which promotes any population in s to r2,
which then blocks the path through r1. The result is
a conditional ﬂip |0f(cid:105) ↔ |1f(cid:105), conditioned on having
zero s† excitations. If we perform f ↔ s swaps before
and after this process, we get a coherent ﬂip between
|0f , 0s(cid:105) ↔ |0f , 1s(cid:105).

To understand the resulting state, let us consider two

local GHZ state generation: Any excitation in level s prevents
the transfer from g to f . (b) The local entangling operation
extends the GHZ state from the f spin-wave to all atoms. As
a result, every atom in the network gets entangled.

In practice, lattice clocks can employ n = 103 − 104
atoms each, that can not be manipulated simultaneously
with high ﬁdelity using Rydberg blockade (see discus-
sion below). In such a case, the atoms can be separated
into M ∼ 10 ensembles within each clock, as shown in
Figure 1. Eﬃcient local entanglement can be achieved
with techniques described in [38] or by using an individ-
ually addressed “messenger” atom, that can be moved
to the vicinity of each ensemble to entangle all atoms
within each clock using dipole-dipole interaction. In such
a case, the messenger atom can used, ﬁrst, to extend the
entanglement to all ensembles in each clock, resulting in
a state |1f(cid:105)KM +|0(cid:105)KM , after which the procedure shown
in Fig. 4(a) applied within each ensemble can be used to
a fully entangled state of all N = K × M n atoms in the
network. (See Supplementary for details.)

Next, we investigate the robustness of our protocol in
light of realistic physical imperfections. We assume that
all imperfections decrease the coherence between the two
components of the GHZ state, and therefore the ﬁdelity
can be written as F = [1 + exp(−εtot)]/2, where εtot is
the sum of the errors. The errors arising during each
non-local connection step εnon-local and the errors arising
during a local GHZ creation in one clock εlocal add up to
the total error

εtot = (K − 1)εnon-local + KM εlocal.

(6)

This error increases linearly with the total number
of atoms in the network, N , and the coeﬃcient,
(εnon-local/M + εlocal)/n, depends on the number of
atoms, n, within a single atom cloud under blockade.
For a certain optimal local atom number nopt, the total
ﬁdelity is maximal, i.e. decreases with the slowest rate,
as N increases.

To be speciﬁc, we focus on a possible implementation
of our scheme with ensembles of neutral ytterbium atoms
whose relevant electronic levels are shown on Fig. 5.
We identify the following levels of neutral Yb relevant
|g(cid:105) = |6s2(1S0)(cid:105), |f(cid:105) = |6s6p(3P0)(cid:105),
for our protocol:
|s(cid:105) = |6s6p(3P2)(cid:105) and |e(cid:105) = |6s6p(1P1)(cid:105), and two Rydberg

surement of nsk → m ∈ {0, 1}, the state becomes
|0, 1, 1 − m(cid:105) + |1, 0, m(cid:105), where the remaining kets stand

With the optimal ensemble size nopt, determined
above, we consider the total number of entangled atoms
N . Although having more atoms always results in im-
proved clock precision, entangling all available atoms is
not necessarily optimal. To see this, we compare the sta-
bility of the entangled clock network and a non-entangled
network, and ﬁnd an optimal entangled atom number

schemes, where ω0 is the central frequency and τ is the
total available measurement time. The additional factor
of 2F − 1 = e−EN is due to the reduced Fisher infor-
mation of a non-pure GHZ state, where F is the ﬁdelity
of the initial state. (See supplementary materials for de-
tails.) For E = Emin = 1.8 × 10−5, Eq. (7) is maximized
with optimal atom number Nopt ≈ 1/(2Emin) ≈ 25000,
where Gmax ∼ 12, and F = [1 + e−NoptEmin]/2 = 0.82.
The optimal gain is achieved by 25000 entangled atoms
distributed in Kopt = Nopt/(M n)opt ≈ 10 clocks.

We presented and analyzed a protocol, capable of fully
entangling ensembles of neutral atoms located in diﬀer-
ent atomic clocks. Local interactions are made robust
by utilizing the strong interaction between Rydberg ex-
citations, and non-local entanglement creation is made
reliable with strong atom-light coupling, suppressed pho-
ton propagation errors and long atomic memory lifetimes.
We showed that our scheme, in particular a realization
with neutral Yb ensembles, is feasible and provides signif-
icant gain over non-entangled schemes even in the light
of physical imperfections. Our results provide the ﬁrst
detailed proposal for a neutral atom clock network that
can serve as a ﬁrst prototype of the global quantum clock

spontaneously decays to the ground state.

with the same principle quantum number ˜n. Collec-
tive enhancement and phase matching of the laser pulses
make the emitted photons leave in a well-deﬁned, narrow
solid angle, resulting in high photon collection eﬃciency.
Due to the diﬀerent symmetries of these states, the co-
herent coupling can be done via 1-photon transitions for
r1 ↔ g and r2 ↔ s, and requires 2-photon transitions for
r1 ↔ e and r1 ↔ f . We envision the atoms being held in
position by an optical lattice with period a = 275.75 nm,
each potential minimum holding exactly one Yb atom.
(The lattice intensity can be modulated during the Ryd-
berg state excitation [39].)

We consider the following errors in our analysis. Dur-
ing non-local connection, we take into account the ﬁnite
r1-r2 interaction, which allows the creation of an r1 ex-
citation with some small probability, even if r2 is popu-
lated, the ﬁnite lifetime of the s and r2 levels, and the
dark-count rate of photo-detectors. For the local GHZ
creation step, we account for the same imperfection of
the r1-r2 blockade as for the non-local entangling step,
the ﬁnite lifetimes of the Rydberg levels r1 and r2, and
the imperfect self-blockade of the single excited Rydberg
states r1. (See Supplementary Materials for details.) We
estimate the eﬀect of these errors, and numerically opti-
mize the free parameters: the Rabi frequency Ω of the
transferring pulses g → r1 and r1 → f , and the num-
ber of local atoms n, for principle quantum numbers,
50 ≤ ˜n ≤ 150 of the Rydberg levels, in order to ﬁnd the
minimal error per atom, E := εtot/N .
To illustrate, for Rydberg levels ˜n = 120, we ﬁnd
that the highest ﬁdelity is reached for nopt ≈ 146, and
Ω = 105 γ, where γ ∼ 103 s−1 is the natural linewidth of
the Rydberg levels, for a clock size of (M n)opt = 2500.
In this case, the error per atom is Emin = [εtot/N ]min =
1.8 × 10−5. Contributions of the diﬀerent error sources
are shown in Table I. We ﬁnd that the decay of the Ryd-
berg level, and imperfect blockade cause the majority of
imperfections, both arising during the critical step, local

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS

Appendix A: Using the messenger atom

With proper optical control, we can entangle the en-
sembles by moving a single Rydberg atom to the vicinity
of each ensemble sequentially, such that its blockade ra-
dius covers one of the clouds entirely. Starting from the
state

|g(cid:105)nM(cid:0)|s(cid:105) + |r2(cid:105)(cid:1),

where the ﬁrst nM ket stand for the state of all atoms
in the M ensembles (each having n atoms), and the last
one represents the state of the messenger atom.
In a
sequence, we imagine the messenger atom to be brought
√
to the vicinity of each ensemble, and the pulse sequence
[π/
N ]g,r1, [pi]f,r1, creates an f excitation, conditioned
on the state of the messenger atom. This plays out as
follows

→ |g(cid:105)n(M−1)(cid:16)|1f(cid:105)1|s(cid:105) + |0(cid:105)1|r2(cid:105)(cid:17)
→ |g(cid:105)n(M−2)(cid:16)|1f(cid:105)1|1f(cid:105)2|s(cid:105) + |0(cid:105)1|0(cid:105)2|r2(cid:105)(cid:17)

the required entangled state before the ﬁnal GHZ exten-
sion step.

Disregarding the technical diﬃculties of trapping mul-
tiple atomic ensembles in the same vacuum chamber, this
entangling method has a higher ﬁdelity than the previ-
ous, photon-based, protocol, since it does not suﬀer from
the errors aﬀecting the photon emission, propagation and
detection. We model the imperfections of this scheme by
summing the error terms ε1+ε2+ε3 only (from Eq. (C2),
(C5), (C7)).

depends on the number of atoms at a single clock, n, and
the Rabi-frequency of the dressing ﬁeld used for local
entanglement growing.

We separate out the minimization of E (through ﬁnd-
ing the optimal n, Ω parameters), and the maximization

because both the maximum of G and the optimal value

interpret.

The initial GHZ state is never perfect due to a series of
imperfections in the implementation. Here, we analyze
the main errors responsible for lowering the initial ﬁdelity
Flocal = [1 + exp(−εlocal)]/2 of the GHZ state of n atoms,
created via the conditional dressing scheme, described in
the main article. We assume the following errors to be
independent and small, and we approximate εlocal with
j εj. We evaluate the
errors for a 2D square lattice ﬁlled in a circular region
and a 3D cubic lattice ﬁlled in a spherical region (both
of radius R). Where there is a diﬀerence between the two
cases, we give both results.

not large enough, the population transfer g → f happens
even if r2 is populated by a single atom. Here, we analyze
the eﬀect of this imperfection.

2. Decaying Rydberg states

Appendix D: Non-local entangling errors

During the pulse sequence that induce the population
transfer from g to f , the r1 level is populated by an
average of 1/2 atoms. With constant Ω Rabi frequency,
the times of the pulse j is

error during the pulse sequence due to decay or dephasing

Our protocol requires K − 1 links to be set up between

During the excitation of the Rydberg state r1, double
excitations are mostly shifted out of resonance by ∆11
due to the strong van der Waals interaction between two
r1 atoms. The time average of the population in the
state where one Rydberg atom is excited is 1/2. The

In the meantime, the r2 level is populated by a single
atom. The decay and dephasing of r2, which we assume
to be happening with rate γ2 causes error accumulation,

Although the two errors aﬀect diﬀerent components of

When exciting a single collective excitations, imper-
fect self-blockade can result in leakage into double excited
states. The probability of this can be exponentially re-
duced by applying a smooth driving pulse. E.g., in case
of a Gaussian pulse of width τ , and area π, exciting the
g → r1 transition is expected to be blocked when r2 is
populated, but it succeeds with probability Pdouble,

3. Photon propagation and detection errors

The pairs of photons can get lost in the ﬁber during
propagation and the detection process (which is limited
to 50% for time-resolving detectors, and 25% for non-
time-resolving ones). The two-photon heralding, how-
ever, detects both of these errors. The remaining error
comes from dark-counts of the detectors. This aﬀects a
single link with the error

ε5 ≈ 4γdarkTdetect = γdark

20
nγe

,

(D4)

where γdark is the dark count rate of the detectors, Tdetect
(chosen such that a properly timed detector would have
a chance to catch 1 − e−5 > 99% of each photon) is the
“open time” of the detector, and γe is the spontaneous
emission lifetime of the |e(cid:105) → |f(cid:105) transitions. The fac-
tor of n is due to the collective enhancement of the said
transition, and the factor of 4 is because four pulses are
used in each connection.

4. Memory loss

During the creation step of each link, the state |s(cid:105) is
used as memory. On average, every link relies on one
s qubit. The time it takes to attempt the creation of
a link is ∼ 2L/c, the time it takes for a light pulse to
do a round-trip between two stations. During this time,
quantum information is stored in qubit s, which is subject
decoherence happening at a rate γs. The inﬁdelity of the
link originating from this error is

5.

Imperfect photon collection

Collective enhancement makes the excited atom in
state |e(cid:105) decay preferentially to |g(cid:105), and emit a photon
directly to the spatial mode ke, where ke is the spatial
frequency of the collective mode e. In the implementation
with Yb atoms (discussed in Section E), the decay chan-
nel to |g(cid:105) has a close to unity branching ratio (ζ = 0.99),

where w is the radius of the ensembles cross section per-
pendicular to ke, (w = a(n/π)1/2 for 2D, and w =
a(3n/(4π))1/3 for 3D.), and ke = 2π/(1.4 µm), and
f ∼ 100 is the ﬁness of the cavity that we envision using.

Appendix E: Implementation with Yb

We imagine using the lower levels of neutral Yb for
our protocol, |g(cid:105) = |6s2(1S0)(cid:105), |f(cid:105) = |6s6p(3P0)(cid:105), |s(cid:105) =
|6s6p(3P2)(cid:105) and |e(cid:105) = |6s6p(1P1)(cid:105), and two Rydberg lev-
els |r1(cid:105) = |6s˜npm=+1(1P1)(cid:105) and |r2(cid:105) = |6s˜ns(3S1)(cid:105) with

the 2D lattice, we set the quantization axis perpendic-
ular to the plane in which the atoms reside, this way
the dipole-dipole interaction between two atoms, one in
|r2(cid:105) and the other in |r1(cid:105), depends only on their separa-
tion, |r1 − r2|. In the case of the 3D lattice, we rely on
the overwhelming strength of the Rydberg interaction to
produce reliable blockade even between atoms in diﬀerent
horizontal planes.

1. Rydberg lifetimes

We use the measured values from [41] for principle
quantum numbers ˜n ∼ 20 − 30, and extrapolate the in-
verse lifetimes of the Rydberg states

γ1 ≈ γ2 = γ =

8.403 × 108 s−1
(˜n − 4.279)3

(E1)

where ˜n is the principle quantum number of the Ryd-
berg orbit. Although the measurement was carried out
at 300 K, the contribution of the black body radiation
(at ˜n ∼ 20 − 30) is negligible even at this temperature,
and therefore our extrapolation accurately describes the
eﬀect of spontaneous emission on the lifetime. Cooling
of the radiation environment will be necessary to reach
the above lifetime at ˜n ∼ 100 and above. Further-
more, the photoionization rate in a trapping ﬁeld with
104 W/cm2 intensity is also more than one order of mag-
nitude smaller.

2. Self-blockade, ∆11

The long-range interaction between two r1 atoms at a
distance R is dominated by the van der Waals potential,

∆11(R) =

C (6)
11R6 ,

(E2)

where C (6)
11 strongly depends on the principle quantum
number ˜n. We use results from [42], and extrapolate the
C (6)
11 coeﬃcient to high principle quantum numbers with
the following formula,

11 = (−0.116 + 0.0339 ˜n) ˜n11 a.u.
C (6)
(E3)
0 = 9.573 ×
where the a.u. stands for atomic units, Eha6
10−80 Jm6, where Eh is the Hartree energy and a0 is the
Bohr radius.

3. Cross-blockade, ∆12

The long-range interaction between an r1 and an r2
atoms at a distance R is dominated by the dipole-dipole
interaction. We assume that the atoms are conﬁned in
the xy plane, and because the 6s˜npm=+1 state is polar-
ized in the z direction, the interaction strength is inde-
pendent of the relative direction of one atom to the other.

∆12(R) =

(E4)

where C (3)
12 depends strongly on the principle quantum

the following formula,

C (3)

12 = (0.149 + 0.00077 ˜n) ˜n4 a.u.

4. Decay rates of lower levels

The decay rate of |s(cid:105) = |6s6p , 3P2(cid:105) is γs = [14.5 s]−1 =
0.069 s−1. The decay rate of the excited state |e(cid:105) =
|6s6p , 1P1(cid:105) is γe = 1.8 × 108 s−1.

5. Photon channels

We assume that neighboring stations are L < 10 km
apart from each other, we neglect ﬁber and coupling loss.
We further assume that single photon detectors have a
low dark count rate, i.e. γdark ≈ 10 s−1.

D3, D4, D5 and D6).

It is clear that the larger M is, the smaller the er-
ror is, however nM (the number of atoms in a single
clock) is limited by the current state of technology to
(nM )opt ∼ 2500.
Independently from the total atom
number, N , there is an optimal ensemble size, nopt, for
which E (the total error per atom) is minimal. Below we
ﬁnd the optimal values of the parameters Ω, (the Rabi
frequency the population transfer), and n (the size of the
each ensemble) for ﬁxed values of ˜n (the principle quan-
tum number of the Rydberg state) and a = 275.75 nm.

4. Cram´er-Rao bound

The average Fisher information F is a good measure of
the posterior uncertainty of the phase φ, if the prior dis-
tribution of the phase has been previously narrowed down
to a small enough interval such that its posterior is single
peaked. In case of using the GHZ state, this requires a
very narrow prior to start with: φ ∈ [−π/N, +π/N ]. In
our previous work, we showed that this is possible by em-
ploying the atoms in a scheme using a series of cascaded
GHZ states [7]. The Cram´er-Rao bound on the expected
deviation of the estimated φ from the true one implies

using the same number of atoms) as a function of prin-
ciple quantum number ˜n. This is shown on Fig. 10. For
˜n = 120, the gain is Gmax = 10 (2D) and 12 (3D).

Since the ﬁdelity FN decreases with increasing N , there

If each clock runs with the optimal setup (nopt), then
the total error per atom, E, is minimal, and the total

ﬁdelity can be written as FN =(cid:2)1 + e−EminN(cid:3) /2. Plug-
