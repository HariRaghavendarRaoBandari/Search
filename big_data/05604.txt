REGULARITY FOR PARABOLIC SYSTEMS OF UHLENBECK TYPE WITH

ORLICZ GROWTH

LARS DIENING, TONI SCHARLE, AND SEBASTIAN SCHWARZACHER

Abstract. We study the local regularity of p-caloric functions or more generally of ϕ-caloric func-
tions. In particular, we study local solutions of non-linear parabolic systems with homogeneous right
hand side, where the leading term has Uhlenbeck structure with Orlicz growth. This paper closes
the gap to [24] where the author proved that if the gradient of a solution is bounded, it is H¨older
continuous.

Moreover, we show new natural local estimates for the gradient of the solutions, which generalize
and improve the pioneering estimates of DiBenedetto and Friedman [11, 9] for the p-Laplace heat
equation.

In this paper we study the local regularity of p-caloric functions and ϕ-caloric functions. The

p-caloric functions are local, weak solutions of the p-Laplace heat equation

where ϕ : [0, ∞) → [0, ∞) is an Orlicz function satisfying the natural condition ϕ′′(t) t h ϕ′(t), see
Assumption 2.1 for more details. The case ϕ(t) = 1
p tp corresponds to p-caloric functions, so p-caloric
functions are a special case of ϕ-caloric functions. All solutions in this paper may be scalar or vectorial,
i.e. we study both equations and systems.

More explicitly, let J be a time interval and Ω a domain in Rn. Then we will study local weak
solutions u of (1.2). In particular, we study functions u : J × Ω → RN with u ∈ L∞(J, L2(Ω)) and
ϕ(|∇u|) ∈ L1(J, L1(Ω)) such that

Let us begin with the case of p-caloric functions. It is known that if ∇u is locally in L2, then ∇u is
already H¨older continuous. This was proven in the celebrated works of DiBenedetto and Friedman [10,
11]. In the ﬁrst step of the proof the authors show the boundedness of ∇u. Unfortunately, it was
necessary to have separate proofs for the sub-linear case p ≤ 2 and the super-linear case p ≥ 2. We
will introduce in this paper a new approach that allows to handle both cases at once.

The origins to prove L∞ bounds of quasi-linear or non-linear parabolic solutions was achieved by
Nash [28] and Moser [27] by the celebrated DiGiorgi-Nash-Moser technique. For degenerate non-linear
elliptic equations this technique was adapted by Ural’ceva [31] and for non-linear elliptic systems by
Uhlenbeck [30]. Both authors proved H¨older continuity of the gradients of p-harmonic functions, i.e.

solutions of div(cid:0)|∇u|p−2∇u(cid:1) = 0. Up to this day this is the best regularity result for homogeneous

solutions to the p-Laplace equation which is known for space dimensions n ≥ 3.

Later it was observed by various authors, that the growth restrictions can be generalized to Orlicz
growth. For the elliptic homogeneous theory we refer to [23, 25, 17, 7] and also the book [5]. Under
natural assumptions on the Orlicz growth it is shown in these references, that the gradients of local
weak solutions are H¨older continuous. As a consequence the so called non-linear Calder´on-Zygmund

theory was applicable and many results for elliptic systems with Orlicz growth and inhomogeneous
right hand side were proven, see for example [14, 18, 2]. Some results could be generalized to the
framework of some incompressible non Newtonian ﬂuid models [13, 15].

Let us consider now the case of ϕ-caloric functions. Lieberman showed, that ϕ-caloric functions
with bounded gradients already have H¨older continuous gradients. However, the step proving local
boundedness of the gradients was still missing. In this work we will close this gap. We will reduce the
boundedness of the gradients to local L2-integrability. For equations this gap was closed independently
by Baroni and Lindfors [3, Theorem 1.2].

We wish to point out one improvement of our L∞-gradient estimates in comparison with all lit-
erature available and which is a novelty even for scalar p-caloric functions.
In DiBenedetto and
Friedman [10, 11] the gradients are pointwisely estimated in terms of the maximum of a constant and
a suitable mean average of the gradients. Therefore, if the average of the gradients is small, we still
only get |∇u| ≤ c. In our estimates we are able to get rid of this “maximum of a constant and . . . ”,
so if the gradient averages are small, we also get pointwise small gradients. See the discussions after
Corollary 2.2 for more details.

Moreover, it might also be of interest, that our proof is a lot shorter than the original one by

2. Notations and main results

To simplify the notation the letter c will denote a positive constant, which may vary throughout
the paper but will not depend on the important quantities. We write f . g for f ≤ c g and f & g for
f ≥ c g. Moreover, we write f h g if f . g . f . We say that a function f : (0, ∞) → (0, ∞) is almost
increasing if f (t2) ≤ c f (t1) for all t2 ≥ t1. For a ball B, resp. cylinder Q, and λ > 0 we deﬁne λB,
resp. λQ, as the ball/cylinder with the same center but radii scaled by the factor λ.

We begin, by introducing the assumptions on our Orlicz function ϕ. The assumptions are quite

standard and motivated by the elliptic theory, see for example [17].

ass:main1 Assumption 2.1. Let ϕ :

[0, ∞) → [0, ∞) be convex function with ϕ ∈ C2((0, ∞)) ∩ C1([0, ∞)),

eq:assmain1
eq:assmain1

ϕ(0) = 0, ϕ′(0) = 0 and limt→∞ ϕ(t) = ∞. Moreover, we assume, that
(2.1)

ϕ′(t) h ϕ′′(t)t.

The constants hidden in ”h” will be referred to as the characteristics of ϕ.

One consequence of Assumption 2.1 is that ϕ and its conjugate function ϕ∗, given by ϕ∗(s) =
supt≥0(st − ϕ(t)), automatically satisﬁes the ∆2 condition, i.e. ϕ(2t) ≤ c ϕ(t) and ϕ∗(2t) ≤ c ϕ∗(t)
for all t ≥ 0, see for example (2.2) of [4]. This excludes linear and exponential growth. The func-
tions ϕ(t) = 1

p tp with 1 < p < ∞ satisfy Assumption 2.1.

Our main theorem is the following

thm:main Theorem 2.2. Let ϕ satisfy Assumption 2.1 and let ρ(t) :=(cid:0)ϕ(t)(cid:1)

The constant only depends on the characteristics of ϕ.

The proof of this theorem can be found in Section 4.
The assumption in Theorem 2.2 that ρ is almost increasing reﬂects the usual restriction of the
exponents near 1 for the parabolic p-Laplace. These restrictions arise due to the diﬀerent scaling of
the time derivative and the elliptic part. This eﬀect is sometimes also called scaling deﬁcit. It would
replaced by ϕ(|∇u|). However, the scaling deﬁcit prevents
be desirable in (2.2) to have ρ(|∇u|)α
this. The only case with no scaling deﬁcit, is ϕ(t) = 1
2 t2, which corresponds to the standard heat
equation. Only then, we have ρ(t) h ϕ(t). See Remark 2.5 for an explanation, how the restriction

Since the case of p-caloric functions is of special interest, let us phrase our main result for this

special situation.

Remark 2.4. Note that in Theorem 2.2 as well as in Corollary 2.3 we need ∇u ∈ L2
loc(2Q). For
p-caloric functions with p ≥ 2, this regularity is natural. In the sub-linear case, this is not obvious.
However, for the initial boundary value problem of ϕ-caloric functions on the whole space Rn with
initial values in W 1,2(Ω), this regularity follows for example from [19, Theorem 5.1].

Let us compare this novel result to the estimates DiBenedetto [9, Chap VIII, Theorem 5.1 and

Theorem 5.2]. There the following estimates are proven.

To compare this estimates with (2.3) it is the easiest to think of the case α = 1. If the average integrals
on the right hand side of (2.5) are small, then we get 1 on the right side. Thus, we get a local bound
for the gradients, but do not know if the gradients must be small. The estimate (2.3) however allows
to deduce smallness of the gradients if the average integrals are small. This is a novel improvement.
The proof of Theorem 2.2 is based on the DeGiorgi iteration technique. The necessary gain in
integrability is achieved by the following theorem, which is proved in Section 3 and is of independent
interest. Note that the quantity V (∇u) in this theorem is a very natural quantity for equations
involving the p-Laplacian, resp. ϕ-Laplacian.

We have shown in Theorem 2.2 the local boundedness of the gradients. We want to apply the results
of Lieberman [24, Corollary 2.1] to obtain H¨older continuity of the gradients. Lieberman studied weak
solutions of (1.2)

with certain conditions on F . In our situation we have

Therefore, condition (1.2) of [24], namely δ − 1 ≤ tF ′(t)
F (t) ≤ g0 − 1 for some δ, g0 > 0 is equivalent
to our condition (2.1). Also conditions (2.2a) is a consequence of our condition (2.1), see Section 3.
However, to apply the result of Lieberman, we need to assume the following oﬀ-diagonal uniform

to (1.2) on J × Ω, with ∇u ∈ L2

Moreover, there exists a µ ∈ (0, 1) such that for any cylinder QR = (t − R2, t) × BR(x) ⊂ J × Ω
and QR = (t − r2, t) × Br(x) with r < 1

This theorem in combination with our Theorem 2.2 implies the local H¨older continuity of ϕ-caloric

functions.

At this point we wish to emphasize the importance of the regularity results of Theorem 2.2 and
Theorem 2.7 for systems with inhomogeneous right hand side. Regularity theory for non-linear PDE
with inhomogeneous right hand side is successfully achieved by the so called non-linear Calder´on
Zygmund theory. It was ﬁrst used for the p-Laplacian by Iwaniec [20], see also [8]. The core of this
theory is the combination of a Calder´on-Zygmund decomposition (e.g. of the gradient of the solution)
combined with local comparison with p-harmonic, resp. p-caloric functions. The local regularity of the
homogeneous system is therefore of fundamental importance. The local L∞-bound (of DiBenedetto
and Friedman) of the gradient of p-caloric functions was successfully used to derive higher integrability
results [1]. The H¨older estimates for the gradients of p-caloric functions has been used to show H¨older
continuity for the inhomogeneous system [11, 26] and to derive estimates of BMO-Type [29]. Moreover,
it is a necessary tool for the proof of pointwise potential estimates [21, 22] and for almost everywhere
regularity results by p-caloric approximation [6].

3. Differentiability

In this section we prove the higher regularity estimates of Theorem 3.5. For this we have to start
with a few properties on our N-function ϕ and its relations to the quantities of our equation. Again
we assume that ϕ satisﬁes Assumption 2.1.

First of all, we deﬁne the quantities A, V : Rn×N → Rn×N by

A(P ) := ϕ′(|P |)

Then our ϕ-Laplacian heat equation can be written as

The quantity V (∇u) is well known from the regularity theory of systems with a p-Laplace, in which

We have (ϕa)b = ϕa+b. Note that the family ϕa also satisﬁes Assumption 2.1 with characteristics
uniformly bounded with respect to a ≥ 0. This implies that the families ϕa and (ϕa)∗ satisfy the
∆2-condition with constants independent of a ≥ 0. Note that ϕ0 = ϕ. Moreover, uniformly in a, t ≥ 0

The following lemma from [12] summarizes many important relations between A, V and the shifted

N-functions ϕa.
Lemma 3.1. Uniformly in P, Q ∈ Rn×N we have

(3.4)

(3.5)

|A(P ) − A(Q)| h ϕ′

|P |(|P − Q|).

In combination with (3.2) many variants of these equivalences follow.

We can apply the standard Young’s inequality for N-function, which are in our context as follows:

For every δ > 0 there exists cδ > 0 such that uniformly in a, s, t ≥ 0

a(s) t ≤ δ ϕa(s) + cδ(ϕa)∗(t),
ϕ′
a(s) t ≤ cδ ϕa(s) + δ(ϕa)∗(t).

Moreover, the following estimates are versions of Young’s inequalities and can be found in [16].

lem:shiftchange

Lemma 3.2 (Shift-change lemma). For every δ > 0 there exists cδ > 0 such that for all P, Q ∈ Rn×N
and t ≥ 0 we have

ϕ|P |(t) ≤ cδϕ|Q|(t) + δ |V (P ) − V (Q)|2,

(ϕ|P |)∗(t) ≤ cδ(ϕ|Q|)∗(t) + δ |V (P ) − V (Q)|2.

The higher regularity of ϕ-caloric will be obtained by the diﬀerence quotient technique, which
corresponds formally to a localized version of the testfunction ∆u. Therefore we introduce the following
notation: For a function f : Rn → RN we write (τh,j f )(x) = f (x + hej) − f (x), (δh,jf )(x) =
h−1(f (x + hej) − f (x)) and δhf = (δh,1f, . . . , δh,nf ). Moreover, we use the translation operator
Tx(y) = x + y. The following theorem is a special case of Theorem 3.5 below with f = 1.

−div(ϕ′(|∇u|) ∇u
|∇u| are exactly as in [12]. The terms involving the time derivatives are also quite
standard to handle for a parabolic system.
(cid:3)

We need the following simple lemma that shows that ∇V (∇u) ∈ L2 guarantees that ∇2u exists
at least as an L1-function. We state the stationary version, since the parabolic one is just one more
integration over time.

Also like in the previous section, we get for Ij with Lemma 3.1:

The estimate for IIIj is the same as in the stationary of [12, Theorem 11]. The additional factor make
for this term no diﬀerence as every step is of pointwise manner and we get:

For Ij in 3.12, we note that |δhu|f ′(|δhu|) is bounded uniformly in h because of f ′(t) = 0 for large t.
For the integrand of Ij this gives with the help of Lemma 3.1

Together with our assumption that u ∈ W 1,2, this means we can use the generalized theorem of
dominated convergence and get after a short calculation

Using the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality and the fact that f ′(t) ≥ 0 we conclude that I converges to a
non negative function and can be omitted. Adding up over j in (3.9), taking the limit h → 0 and
absorbing the right hand side term including ∇V into the left hand side concludes the proof.
(cid:3)

In the following we use the notation (a)+ := max {a, 0} and {v > γ} = {(t, x) : v(t, x) > γ}. We

write χA for the indicator function of the set A.

We want to point out that Theorem 3.5 strongly simplify the proof in [9] for p-caloric functions,
since we do not need to distinguish the sub-linear p < 2 and super-linear p > 2 case. In all situations
we can choose the easy function f (v) = χ{v>γ} in Theorem 3.5. This gives:

4. L∞-bounds of the Gradient

In this section we prove the boundedness of the gradients ∇u by means of the DiGeorgi technique.
We assume that the assumptions of Theorem 3.5 are satisﬁed. In particular, u is a local ϕ-caloric
solution on J × Ω and Q = I × B = (t − αR2, t) × BR(x) ⋐ J × Ω.
We deﬁne the sequence of scaled cylinders with the same center

Qk = 2(1 + 2−k) Q.

Now choose ζk ∈ C∞

To prove 4.1 we ﬁrst note that for h(t) = t2 or h(t) = (ϕ′(t)t)

h(v) = h(v) − h(γk) + h(γk)

and for k ≥ 1 we get using the intermediate value theorem of diﬀerential calculus with some t ∈
