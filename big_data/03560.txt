Weakly asymmetric bridges

and the KPZ equation

Cyril Labb´e

Universit´e Paris Dauphine†

Abstract
We consider a discrete bridge from (0, 0) to (2N, 0) evolving according to the cor-
ner growth dynamics, where the jump rates are subject to an upward asymmetry
of order N −α with α > 0. We provide a classiﬁcation of the static and dynamic
behaviour of this model according to the value of the parameter α. Our main
results concern the hydrodynamic limit and the ﬂuctuations of the bridge. For
α < 1, the hydrodynamic limit is given by the entropy solution of the inviscid
Burgers equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. For α ≤ 1/3, we show that
the ﬂuctuations around this hydrodynamic limit are given by the KPZ equation on
the line and restricted to the time interval [0, T ): the ﬁnal time T is inﬁnite when
α < 1/3, while in the regime α = 1/3 it equals the ﬁnite time needed by the
hydrodynamic limit to reach its stationary state.

The simple exclusion process is a statistical physics model that has received much
attention from physicists and probabilists over the years. The purpose of the present
article is to study the scaling limits of a particular instance of this process, accord-
ing to the asymmetry imposed on the jump rates.
Consider a system of N particles on the linear lattice {1, . . . , 2N}, subject to the

exclusion rule that prevents any two particles from sharing a same site. Each par-
ticle, independently of the others, jumps to its left at rate pN and to its right at
rate 1 − pN as long as the target site is not occupied. Additionally, we impose a
“zero-ﬂux” boundary condition to the system: a particle located at site 1, resp. at
site 2N, is not allowed to jump to its left, resp. to its right. At any given time t, let
Xi(t) be equal to +1 if the i-th site is occupied, and to −1 otherwise.
It is classical to associate to such a particle system a so-called height function,
deﬁned by

k

S(0) = 0 , S(k) =

Xi , k = 1, . . . , 2N .

Xi=1

Necessarily, S(2N) = 0 so that S is a discrete bridge. The dynamics of the parti-
cle system can easily be expressed at the level of the height function: at rate pN ,
resp. 1 − pN , each downwards corner, resp. upwards corner, ﬂips into its opposite:
we refer to Figure 1 for an illustration. The law of the corresponding dynamical
interface will be denoted by PN.

This dynamics admits a unique reversible probability measure:

where A(S) =P2N

k=1 S(k) is the area under the discrete bridge S, and ZN is a nor-
malisation constant, usually referred to as the partition function. This observation
appears in various forms in the literature, see for instance [JL94, FS10, EL15]. No-
tice that the dynamics is reversible w.r.t. µN even if the jump rates are asymmetric:
this feature of the model is a consequence of our “zero-ﬂux” boundary condition.
From now on, we only consider “upwards” asymmetries, that is, pN ≥ 1/2, and
we aim at understanding the behaviour of the interface according to the strength of
the asymmetry. It is clear that the interface will be pushed higher and higher as the
asymmetry increases. On the other hand, the interface is subject to some geometric
restrictions: it is bound to 0 at both ends, and it is lower than the deterministic shape
k 7→ k ∧ (2N − k). Actually, it is simple to check that under a strong asymmetry,
that is, pN = p > 1/2, the interface is essentially stuck to the latter deterministic

shape. Therefore, to see non-trivial behaviours we need to consider asymmetries
that vanish with N. We make the following choice of parametrisation:

The important parameter is α. When it equals +∞, we are in the symmetric regime,
while α = 0 corresponds to a strong asymmetry. In the present paper, we investi-
gate the whole range α ∈ (0,∞).
The results of this paper are divided into three parts: ﬁrst, we characterise the scal-
ing limit of the invariant measure; second, the scaling limit of the ﬂuctuations at
equilibrium; and third, we investigate the scaling limit of the dynamics out of equi-
librium. As we will see, the model displays a large variety of limiting behaviours,
some of them already appear in related contexts of the literature. In the particular
case α = 1, let us cite the works of Derrida and his coauthors [ED04, DELO05] on
a similar model interacting with reservoirs or of Dobrushin and Hryniv [DH96] on
the scaling limit of the static model without the bridge condition. We also refer to
the work of Gonc¸alves and Jara [GJ12] on the crossover of the stationary WASEP
on the whole line Z to the KPZ equation. We will cite further references on related
models below.
However, let us emphasise again the reversibility of our model due to the “zero-
ﬂux” boundary condition:
this speciﬁc feature gives rise to limiting behaviours
which have not been observed previously in the literature, in particular the KPZ
ﬂuctuations on a ﬁnite time interval, see below.

From now on, we extend S into a piecewise linear map from [0, 2N] into R:
namely, S is afﬁne on every interval [k, k + 1]. We also let L be the log-Laplace
functional associated to the Bernoulli ±1 distribution with parameter 1/2, namely
L(h) = log cosh h.

1.1 The invariant measure
The main result of this section is a Central Limit Theorem for the interface under
µN . To state this result, we need to rescale appropriately the interface according to
the strength of the asymmetry. For α ≥ 1, the space variable will be rescaled by 2N
so that the rescaled space variable will live in Iα = [0, 1]. On the other hand, for
α < 1, we will zoom in a window of order (2N)α around the center of the lattice,
α = [−N/(2N)α, N/(2N)α] for
hence the rescaled space variable will live in I N
any N ≥ 1, and Iα = R in the limit N → ∞.
This being given, we introduce the curve ΣN
α around which the ﬂuctuations occur.
One would have expected this curve to be deﬁned as the mean of S under µN , but it
is actually more convenient to opt for a different deﬁnition. However, ΣN
α coincides
with the mean under µN up to some negligible terms, see Remark 2.5 below. For
all k ∈ {0, . . . , 2N}, we set xk = k/2N if α ≥ 1, xk = (k − N)/(2N)α if α < 1,

Theorem 1.1 Under the invariant measure µN , we have uN (d)
=⇒ Bα as N → ∞.
The process Bα is a Brownian bridge on [0, 1] when α > 1. For α = 1, resp. α < 1,
it is the image of a Brownian bridge on [0, 1] through a deterministic time change
that maps [0, 1] onto itself, resp. onto R.

Let us make a few comments on this result. For α > 1, the limiting mean shape,
the order of the ﬂuctuations and the limiting law of the ﬂuctuations are “universal”.
For α = 1, the limiting mean shape and the covariance of the limiting ﬂuctuations
depend on the log-Laplace functional of the step distribution of our static model.
This is analogous with the well-known fact that the rate function of moderate de-
viations does not depend on the step distribution, while the rate function of large
deviations does. Notice that the case α = 3/2 is already covered in [EL15]. The
case α = 1 can be deduced from previous results of Dobrushin and Hryniv [DH96]
on paths of random walks conditioned on having a given large area.
We also derive the asymptotics of the partition function ZN .

Finally, let us observe that all the results presented above can be extended to
a more general class of static models: namely, to paths of random walks having
positive probability of coming back to 0 after 2N steps and whose step distribution
admits exponential moments.

In all cases, convergence holds in the Skorohod space D([0,∞),C(Iα)).
Once again, notice the speciﬁc behaviour when α ≤ 1. The proof of this result re-
lies on classical techniques: an important ingredient is the Boltzmann-Gibbs prin-
ciple, which is adapted to the present setting in Proposition 3.4.

(1.7)

1.3 Hydrodynamic limit
The subsequent question we address concerns the convergence to equilibrium: sup-
pose we start from some initial proﬁle S0 at time 0, how does the interface reach
its stationary state ? Informally speaking, we aim at understanding how the macro-
scopic shape of the interface reaches its stationary state given by the curve ΣN
α ,
without paying attention to the ﬂuctuations. Therefore, we restrict ourselves to
α < 3/2, since in the complementary cases and under the stationary measure, the
mean shape is negligible compared to the ﬂuctuations.
We ﬁrst treat the case α ∈ [1, 3/2). We set
S(t(2N)2, x2N)

mN (t, x) :=

(2N)2−α

,

t ≥ 0 , x ∈ [0, 1] .

Notice that the scaling in height and space is consistent with the scaling of the
mean shape under the invariant measure.

Theorem 1.5 Let α ∈ [1, 3/2). We assume that the initial proﬁle mN (0,·) is de-
terministic and converges uniformly to some continuous proﬁle m0(·). In the case
α ∈ (1, 3/2), we consider the further requirement that there exists δi > 0 such that
the δi-H¨older norm of mN (0,·) is uniformly bounded over all N ≥ 1. Then, the
process mN converges in probability, in the Skorohod space D([0,∞),C([0, 1])),
to the deterministic process m where:

(1.9)

Notice that (1.8) and (1.9) are well-posed parabolic PDEs. The case α = 1
is similar to the results of De Masi, Presutti and Scacciatelli [DMPS89] and of
G¨artner [G¨ar88] on the hydrodynamic limit of the WASEP on the line Z: the main
difference comes from the boundedness of our lattice.

Remark 1.6 The H¨older regularity that we impose on the initial condition when
α ∈ (1, 3/2) does not play an important rˆole: it ensures that the process is tight
in a space of continuous functions from time 0. For α = 1, the proﬁle mN (t,·) is
1-Lipschitz for all t ≥ 0 so we do not need to impose this further condition.

In the case α < 1, we set

mN (t, x) :=

S(t(2N)α+1, x2N )

2N

,

t ≥ 0 , x ∈ [0, 1] .

Roughly speaking, our next result shows that mN converges to the solution m of

(∂tm = σ(1 − (∂xm)2) ,
m(t, 0) = m(t, 1) = 0 , m(0,·) = m0(·) .

(1.10)

Compare (1.8), (1.9) and (1.10) and observe that, as α decreases, the asymmetric
term becomes predominant. Actually, the last equation is not well-deﬁned and we
need to work at the level of the derivative of the interface (equivalently, at the level
of the density of particles) in order to establish a rigorous result. Furthermore, the
proof of the convergence is sensitive to the choice of initial condition. For the sake
of clarity, we only consider two initial conditions:

• ﬂat: S(t = 0, k) = k mod 2, for all k ∈ {0, . . . , 2N},
• wedge: S(t = 0, k) = (−k) ∨ (k − 2N), for all k ∈ {0, . . . , 2N}.

Theorem 1.7 Let α < 1. We assume that the initial condition is either ﬂat or
wedge. Then, the process mN converges in probability, for the Skorohod topology
0 (2η(t, y) − 1)dy

on D([0,∞),C([0, 1])), to the deterministic process m(t, x) =R x

where η is the entropy solution of the following inviscid Burgers equation

(∂tη = 2σ∂x(η(1 − η)) ,

η(t, 0) = 1 , η(t, 1) = 0 ,

(1.11)

with initial condition η(0,·) = 1/2 if we start from ﬂat, while if we start from
wedge then η(0, x) = 0 on [0, 1/2] and η(0, x) = 1 on [1/2, 1].

The deﬁnition of the entropy solution of (1.11) will be recalled in Section 4.3. The
process η should be seen as the limiting density of particles. Actually, if we let

line is the solution at some time 0 < t < 1/(2σ), and the dotted line is the solution
at the terminal time 1/(2σ). The blue box corresponds to the window where we
see KPZ ﬂuctuations.

then the main step in the proof of Theorem 1.7 consists in showing that ̺N con-
verges in the Skorohod space of ﬁnite measure-valued processes to the process
η(t, x)dx. The proof is inspired by the seminal work of Rezakhanlou [Rez91]
which establishes, in particular, the convergence of the density of the asymmetric
simple exclusion process, on the whole space Z, to the solution of the inviscid
Burgers equation on R. Let us also mention the work of Bahadoran [Bah12] that
extends the results of Rezakhanlou to domains with open boundaries. Even though
our result is in the spirit of these two works, there are two important differences
that require some additional care. First, our asymmetry is not ﬁxed but vanishes
with N: our space-time scaling is therefore not the so-called Euler scaling consid-
ered in [Bah12, Rez91]. Second, their proofs work when the density of particles is
initially distributed according to a product measure (this is in particular required in
the probabilistic proof of the two-block estimates of [Rez91]).
The ﬁrst point can be handled by splitting the generator into a symmetric and a
fully-asymmetric part, and by adapting the arguments of [Rez91] accordingly. The
second point is problematic if we start from the ﬂat initial condition, which is not
a product measure. We circumvent the difﬁculty by using the monotonicity (in
law) of the height function with respect to its initial proﬁle, and the fact that the
ﬂat initial condition can be bounded from above and below by suitably chosen pro-
ﬁles whose densities are distributed according to product measures, we refer to the
beginning of Section 4.3 for details. Notice that the wedge initial condition is a
product measure so that we do not face this issue in that case.

Let us ﬁnally provide explicitly the solution of the Burgers equation (1.11)
starting from the ﬂat initial condition. At the level of the height function, we have:

m(t, x) = x ∧ (1 − x) ∧ (σt) ,

t > 0 , x ∈ [0, 1] ,

(1.13)

see Figure 3 for an illustration. Notice that the stationary state is reached at the
ﬁnite time T = 1/(2σ).

1.4 KPZ ﬂuctuations
Let us recall the famous result of Bertini and Giacomin [BG97] on the Kardar
Parisi Zhang (KPZ) equation. Consider a simple exclusion process on the inﬁnite

INTRODUCTION

9

lattice Z with jump rates 1/2 + √ǫ to the left and 1/2 to the right. If one starts
from a ﬂat initial proﬁle, then results in [G¨ar88, DMPS89] ensure that the hydro-
dynamic limit grows evenly at speed √ǫ. Then, Bertini and Giacomin look at
the ﬂuctuations around this hydrodynamic limit and show that the random process
√ǫ (S(tǫ−2, xǫ−1)− ǫ−3/2t) converges to the solution of the KPZ equation, whose

expression is given in (1.16) below (in Bertini and Giacomin’s case, σ = 1/2).

Although our setting is similar to the one considered by Bertini and Giacomin,
the “zero-ﬂux” boundary condition induces a major difference: our process admits
a reversible probability measure, while this is not the case on the inﬁnite lattice
Z. However, if one starts the interface “far” from equilibrium, then we are in
an irreversible setting up to the time needed by the interface to reach the stationary
regime, and one would expect the ﬂuctuations to be described by the KPZ equation.
Bertini and Giacomin’s result suggests to rescale the height function by 1/(2N)α,

the space variable by (2N)2α and the time variable by (2N)4α. The space scaling
immediately forces one to take α ≤ 1/2 since, otherwise, the lattice {0, 1, . . . , 2N}
would be mapped onto a singleton in the limit. It happens that the geometry of our
model imposes a further constraint: Theorem 1.7 and Equation (1.13) show that
the interface reaches the stationary state in ﬁnite time in the time scale (2N)α+1;
therefore, as soon as 4α > α + 1, Bertini and Giacomin’s scaling yields an inter-
face which is already at equilibrium in the limit N → ∞. Consequently, we have
to restrict α to (0, 1/3] for this scaling to be meaningful.

We set

The last result of the present paper is the following.

Theorem 1.8 Take α ≤ 1/3 and consider the ﬂat initial condition. As N → ∞,
the sequence hN converges in distribution to the solution of the KPZ equation:

(∂th = 1

h(0, x) = 0 .

2 ∂2

(1.16)

The convergence holds on D([0, T ),C(R)) where T = 1/(2σ) when α = 1/3, and
T = ∞ when α < 1/3. Here D([0, T ),C(R)) is endowed with the topology of
uniform convergence on compact subsets of [0, T ).

Remark 1.9 Amir, Corwin and Quastel [ACQ11] proved that the convergence re-
sult of Bertini and Giacomin [BG97] still holds when one starts from the (very
singular) wedge initial condition on Z. To that end, one needs to add another scal-
ing factor in the discrete Hopf-Cole transform. Using this additional scaling factor,
it is possible to adapt our proof in order to start from the wedge initial condition on
{0, . . . , 2N}: we then get a similar dichotomy between α = 1/3 and α < 1/3.

INTRODUCTION

Observe that for α = 1/3, T is the time needed by the hydrodynamic limit to
reach the stationary state. Indeed, in that case the time-scale of the hydrodynamic
limit coincides with the time-scale of the KPZ ﬂuctuations. Although one could
have thought that the ﬂuctuations continuously vanish as t ↑ T , our result show that
they don’t: the limiting ﬂuctuations are given by the solution of the KPZ equation,
restricted to the time interval [0, T ). This means that the ﬂuctuations suddenly
vanish at time T ; let us give a simple explanation for this phenomenon. At any
time t ∈ [0, T ), the particle system is split into three zones: a high density zone
{1, . . . , λN
t, . . . , 2N} and, in between, the bulk
where the density of particles is approximately 1/2, we refer to Figure 3. The KPZ
ﬂuctuations occur in a window of order N 2α around the middle point of the bulk:
from the point of view of this window, the boundaries of the bulk are “at inﬁnity”
but move “at inﬁnite speed”. Therefore, inside this window the system does not
feel the effect of the boundary conditions until the very ﬁnal time T where the
boundaries of the bulk merge.

Let us recall that the KPZ equation is a singular SPDE: indeed, the solution
of the linearised equation is not differentiable in space so that the non-linear term
would involve the square of a distribution. While it was introduced in the physics
literature [KPZ86] by Kardar, Parisi and Zhang, a ﬁrst rigorous deﬁnition was given
by Bertini and Giacomin [BG97] through the so-called Hopf-Cole transform h 7→

This SPDE is usually referred to as the multiplicative stochastic heat equation: it
admits a notion of solution via Itˆo integration, see for instance [DPZ92, Wal86].
M¨uller [Mue91] showed that the solution is strictly positive at all times, if the
initial condition is non-negative and non-zero. This allows to take the logarithm of
the solution, and then, one can deﬁne the solution of (1.16) to be h := − log ξ/2σ.
This is the notion of solution that we consider in Theorem 1.8.
There exists a more direct deﬁnition of this SPDE (restricted to a bounded domain)
due to Hairer [Hai13, Hai14] via his theory of regularity structures. Let us also
mention the notion of “energy solution” introduced by Gonc¸alves and Jara [GJ14],
for which uniqueness has been proved by Gubinelli and Perkowski [GP15].
It
provides a new framework for characterising the solution to the KPZ equation but
it requires the equation to be taken under its stationary measure.
The literature on the KPZ equation and related discrete models has been growing
fast these last years, we refer to the reviews of Corwin [Cor12], Quastel [Qua12]
or Spohn [Spo16].

The paper is organised as follows.

In Section 2, we study the scaling limit
of the invariant measure. Section 3 is devoted to the ﬂuctuations at equilibrium.
In Section 4 we prove Theorems 1.5 and 1.7 on the hydrodynamic limit, and in
Section 5 we present the proof of the convergence of the ﬂuctuations to the KPZ
equation. Some technical bounds are postponed to the Appendix. The sections are
essentially independent: at some localised places, we will rely on results obtained
on the static of the model in Section 2.

Acknowledgements.
I am indebted to Reda Chhaibi for some deep discussions
on this work at an early stage of the project. I would also like to thank Christophe
Bahadoran for a fruitful discussion on the notion of entropy solutions for the in-
viscid Burgers equation, Nikos Zygouras for pointing out the article [DH96] and
Julien Reygner for his helpful comments on a preliminary version of the paper.

Notations. At some places in the paper, we rely on the one-to-one correspon-
dence between particle systems and discrete interfaces. Namely, to every interface
S(k) = Pk
i=1 Xi, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2N, we associate the particle system η ∈ {0, 1}2N
deﬁned by η(i) = (Xi + 1)/2 for all i ∈ {1, . . . , 2N}. We let τk denote the shift
by k ∈ Z, namely

τkη := (η(k + 1), η(k + 2), . . . , η(k − 1), η(k)) .

(1.18)

where indices are taken modulo 2N.
At several occasions in the paper, we will use microscopic variables in macroscopic
functions: for instance with the rescaled interface uN with α ≥ 1, we will write
uN (k) to denote uN (k/2N). This abusive notation will never raise any confusion,
but will greatly simplify the notations.

2 The invariant measure

Let Be(q) denote the Bernoulli ±1 distribution with parameter q ∈ [0, 1], and let L
be the log-Laplace functional associated with Be(1/2), namely L(h) = log cosh h
for all h ∈ R. For each given N ≥ 1, we will work on the set {−1, +1}2N
endowed with its natural sigma-ﬁeld. The canonical process will be denoted by
X1, . . . , X2N , and will be viewed as the steps of the walk S(n) := Pk≤n Xk.

Recall that A(S) is the area under the walk S, deﬁned in (1.1).
The strategy of the proof consists in introducing an auxiliary measure νN which
is the same as µN except that, under νN , the walk is not conditioned on coming
back to 0 but satisﬁes νN [S(2N)] = 0. This makes νN more amenable to limit
theorems: we establish a Central Limit Theorem and a Local Limit Theorem for
the marginals of the walk under νN . Since µN is equal to νN conditioned on the
event S(2N) = 0, and since the νN -probability of this event can be estimated with
the Local Limit Theorem, we are able to get the convergence of the marginals of
the walk under µN . Let us now provide the details.
Let πN be the law of the simple random walk, that is

πN :=

Remark 2.1 Under the measure νN , the total number of particles is not equal to
N almost surely, but is equal to N in mean. The measure νN can be seen as
a mixture of 2N + 1 measures, each of them being supported by an hyperplane

µN (·) = νN (·| S(2N) = 0) .

and (2.4) follows.

We start with a Central Limit Theorem for νN . Until the end of the section,
k will denote an integer and ~x = (x1, . . . , xk) will be an element of (0, 1]k if
α ≥ 1, of (−∞, +∞]k if α < 1.
It will be convenient to write uN (~x) =
(uN (x1), . . . , uN (xk)). In the case α < 1, we use the convenient notation uN (+∞)
to denote uN (N/(2N)α). For all α > 0, we also set

1 , . . . , xN

, x ∈ R ,

k ) for all ~x as above.

xN := ⌊x(2N)α∧1⌋
(2N)α∧1
xN := +∞ for x = +∞, and ~xN := (xN
Lemma 2.2 The vector uN (~x) under νN converges in distribution to ˜Bα(~x). The
latter random variable is obtained as the marginals of the continuous, Gaussian
process ˜Bα on either [0, 1] with covariance qα(0,· ∧ ·) if α ≥ 1, or on R with
covariance qα(−∞,· ∧ ·) if α < 1.
Proof. The proof is classical, we only provide the details for the case α < 1 as the
other case is treated similarly. Until the end of the proof, i denotes the complex

number √−1. For each j ∈ {1, . . . , k}, we deﬁne kj := N + ⌊xj(2N)α⌋. For all
~t = (t1, . . . , tk) ∈ Rk, let

Lk(~t) :=

It is simple to check that

so that the characteristic function of the vector uN (~xN ) converges pointwise to the
characteristic function of the Gaussian vector of the statement. Since the difference
between uN (~xN ) and uN (~x) is negligible, the lemma follows.

Below, we provide the proof of the ﬁrst lemma. The second lemma follows
from exactly the same arguments, one simply has to notice that uN (xf ) − uN (xN )
converges in law to ˜Bα(xf )− ˜Bα(x), and thatRz∈R ˜g
(z, z +y)dz is the density
at y of this limiting r.v.
Proof of Lemma 2.3. Let us prove the case α < 1 which is more involved. The
main difference in the proof with the case α ≥ 1 lies in the fact that the forthcoming
bound (2.6) cannot be applied to all hN
i simultaneously when α < 1. Indeed, these
coefﬁcients are not bounded uniformly over i and N when α < 1. However, for any
given a > 0, they are bounded uniformly over all i ∈ IN,a := [N − a(2N)α, N +
a(2N)α] and all N ≥ 1.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that x1 < x2 < . . . < xk so that only
xk can take the value +∞. Let ϕh(t) = exp(L(h + it) − L(h)) for t, h ∈ R. This
is the characteristic function of the Bernoulli ±1 r.v. with mean L′(h) so that

ϕh(t) = cos(t) + iL′(h) sin(t) ,

t ∈ R , h ∈ R .

(2.5)

.
In particular, the characteristic function of the r.v. Xi under νN is given by ϕhN
The function ϕ is 2π-periodic and |ϕh(t)| ≤ 1 for all h, t. From (2.5), one deduces
that for any compact set K ⊂ R, there exists r(K) > 0 such that

J2 =ZD2 |Φα(~t)|d~t , D2 = Rk\D1 ,
J3 =ZD3 |ΦN (~t)|d~t , D3 = D\D1 .

i , i ∈ IN,a,
and let r be the corresponding constant introduced above (2.6). We also deﬁne
jp = N + ⌊xp(2N)α⌋ for all p ∈ {1, . . . , k} and

Using the independence of the Xi’s under νN and the fact that the modulus of a

Remark 2.5 It is possible to push the expansion of the local limit theorem one
step further, in the spirit of [Pet75, Thm VII.12]. Then, a simple calculation shows
the following. Let x ∈ (0, 1) if α ≥ 1, and x ∈ R if α < 1. We have

be the sigma-ﬁeld generated by all the Xk, with k ≤ x(2N) when α ≥ 1, with
k ≤ N + x(2N)α when α < 1. Then, the Radon-Nikodym derivative of µN with
respect to νN , restricted to GN
Proof. Let k = ⌊x(2N)⌋ if α ≥ 1, and k = ⌊N + x(2N)α⌋ if α < 1. Using (2.4)

formly bounded over all yk ∈ R and all N ≥ 1, thus yielding the statement of the
corollary.

Lemma 2.7 Let J = [0, 1] if α ≥ 1, and J = [−A, A] for some arbitrary A > 0
if α < 1. For any p ≥ 1 and β ∈ (0, 1/2), we have

As a consequence, the sequence of processes uN under µN is tight in C([0, 1], R) if
α ≥ 1, in C(R, R) if α < 1.
Proof. Observe that the law of uN under µN is invariant under the reparametrisa-
tion x 7→ 1 − x when α ≥ 1, and x 7→ −x when α < 1. Therefore, it sufﬁces to
prove the statement of the lemma with the β-H¨older norm restricted to [0, 1/2] in
the ﬁrst case, and to [−A, 0] in the second case. The uniform absolute continuity

THE INVARIANT MEASURE

17

of Corollary 2.6 ensures in turn that it sufﬁces to bound, uniformly over all N ≥ 1,
the p-th moment of the β-H¨older norm of uN under νN .
First, we bound the p-th moment of uN (0). In the case α ≥ 1, the latter is actually
equal to 0, while for α < 1, we have for any λ ∈ R

log νN [eλuN (0)] =

λ2
2

qα(−∞, 0) + O(N−α/2) ,

uniformly over all N ≥ 1, which ensures that all the moments of uN (0) are uni-
formly bounded in N ≥ 1.
Regarding the H¨older semi-norm, a direct computation shows that for all δ > 0

log νNh exp(cid:16) uN (y) − uN (x)
|y − x|δ

(cid:17)i ≤ kL′′k∞|x − y|1−2δ ,

uniformly over all x, y of the form k/2N with k ∈ {1, . . . , 2N} when α ≥ 1, and
of the form (k− N)/(2N)α with k ∈ {N −⌊A(2N)α⌋, . . . , N +⌊A(2N)α⌋} when
α < 1. Taking δ ∈ (0, 1/2), this yields a ﬁnite bound uniformly over all N ≥ 1
and all such discrete x, y. Using classical interpolation arguments, we deduce that
this bound is still ﬁnite for non-discrete x, y lying in [0, 1] or [−A, A]. Henceforth,
the Kolmogorov Continuity Theorem ensures that for any β ∈ (0, 1/2) and any
p ≥ 1 we have:

where J = [0, 1] for α ≥ 1 and J = [−A, +A] for α < 1. Notice that we did not
introduce a different notation for the modiﬁcation built from the Kolmogorov Con-
tinuity Theorem, since it necessarily coincides almost surely with the continuous
process uN . This concludes the proof.

Let Bα be the process obtained by conditioning ˜Bα to be null at xf , where
xf = 1 if α ≥ 1, and at xf = +∞ if α < 1. It is a simple calculation to check that
the density of the vector (Bα(x1), . . . , Bα(xk)) is given by

Proof of Theorem 1.1. By Lemma 2.7, we know that the sequence of processes uN
under µN is tight, so we only need to identify the limit. Let k ≥ 1 and x1, . . . , xk
be in (0, 1)k if α ≥ 1, and in Rk if α < 1. From (2.4), we deduce that
νN (uN (~xN ) = ~y; uN (xf ) = 0)
.

µN (uN (~xN ) = ~y ) =

νN (uN (xf ) = 0)

By Lemma 2.3, we have

2 (1∧α)g~x

α(~y)(1 + o(1)) ,

uniformly over all N ≥ 1, and all ~y lying in the intersection of Dk,N
compact domain of Rk. Thus, we deduce that for all ~y− < ~y+ ∈ Rk, we have

as N → ∞. Since |uN (~x) − uN (~xN )| = O(1/N

deduce that the ﬁnite dimensional marginals of uN under µN converge to those of
Bα. This concludes the proof.

Proof of Proposition 1.3. Recall that πN is the uniform measure on the set of lat-
tice paths that make 2N steps and start from 0. We write

ZN = 22N πNh(cid:16) pN
qN(cid:17)
Since νN (S(2N) = 0) ≤ 1, it sufﬁces to estimate the exponential term. When α >
1, we use the fact that L(0) = L′(0) = L(3)(0) = 0, L′′(0) = 1 and kL(4)k∞ < ∞,
to get

{S(2N)=0}i = 22N νN (S(2N) = 0) eLS (hN ) .

and the asserted result follows in that case. For α = 1, the result follows from the

the simple facts that L is even and that L(x) − x + log 2 is integrable on [0,∞) to
get

3 Equilibrium ﬂuctuations

The goal of this section is to establish Theorem 1.4. Our method of proof is classi-
cal: ﬁrst, we show tightness of the sequence of processes uN , then we identify the
limit via a martingale problem. Recall that we work under the reversible measure
µN .

3.1 Tightness
From now on, we set J = [0, 1] when α ≥ 1 and J = [−A, +A] for an arbitrary
value A > 0 when α < 1, along with

en(x) =(√2 sin(nπx)
sin(cid:16) nπ

Sobolev spaces

n−2βhf, eni2 < ∞o .

Recall that for α < 1, the value A > 0 is arbitrary. In order to prove tightness
of the sequence uN in the Skorohod space D([0,∞),C([0, 1]) for α > 1 and in
D([0,∞),C(R)) for α < 1, it sufﬁces to show that the sequence of laws of uN (t =
0,·) is tight in C(J), and that for any T > 0 there exists p > 0 such that

see for instance [Bil99, Thm 13.2].
Since we start from the stationary measure, the ﬁrst condition is ensured by Lemma
2.7. To check the second condition, we proceed as follows. We introduce a piece-
wise linear interpolation in time ¯uN of our original process by setting

¯uN (t,·) := (tN + 1 − t(2N)2α∧2)uN(cid:16)

+ (t(2N)2α∧2 − tN )uN(cid:16) tN + 1

where tN := ⌊t(2N)2α∧2⌋.
Lemma 3.1 For all β > 1/2 and all p ≥ 1, we have
H−β(J)i
uniformly over all 0 ≤ s ≤ t ≤ T and all N ≥ 1.

¯uN (t,·)− ¯uN (s,·) = (t− s)(2N)2α∧2(cid:18)uN(cid:16) sN + 1
so that the asserted bound follows from (3.2). If tN ≥ sN + 1, then we write

The second and third increments on the r.h.s. can be bounded using the ﬁrst case

above, yielding a term of order √t − s. Regarding the ﬁrst increment, either tN =

For all n ≥ 1, we let ˆu(t, n) := RJ u(t, x)en(x)dx. Since β > 1/2, (3.2) is proved
as soon as we show that for all p ≥ 1

Let LN be the generator of uN . Using the reversibility of the process, we have the

ˆu(T − (T − t), n) − ˆu(T − (T − s), n) = −Z t

where M N
˜M N

We need an interpolation inequality to conclude the proof of the tightness.

Lemma 3.2 Let η = 1/2 − ǫ and β = 1/2 + ǫ. For ǫ > 0 small enough, there
exist c > 0 and γ, κ ∈ (0, 1) such that

kfkCγ (J) ≤ ckfkκ

Cη(J)kfk1−κ

H−β(J) , ∀f ∈ Cη(J) ∩ H−β(J) .

(3.4)

Proof. We rely on two classical interpolation results, we refer to the book of
Triebel [Tri78] for the proofs. For q ≥ 1 and δ ∈ (0, 1), let W δ,q(J) be the space
of functions f : J → R such that

kfkW δ,q := kfkLq +(cid:16)ZsZt

|f (t) − f (s)|q
|t − s|δq+1 ds dt(cid:17)

q < ∞ .

For η, β > 0 and κ ∈ (0, 1), we set δ := κη − (1 − κ)β as well as q := 2/(1 − κ).
Then, there exists c′ > 0 such that
kfkW δ,q ≤ c′kfkκ

H−β , ∀f ∈ Cη ∩ H−β .

Cηkfk1−κ

Furthermore, for any γ > 0 such that (δ − γ)q > 1 there exists c′′ > 0 such that

kfkCγ ≤ c′′kfkW δ,q , ∀f ∈ W δ,q .

Therefore, taking κ ∈ (2/3, 1), η = 1/2 − ǫ and β = 1/2 + ǫ with ǫ small enough,
we deduce the statement of the lemma.

Using Lemma 2.7, the stationarity of the process uN and the deﬁnition of ¯uN ,

we deduce that for all p ≥ 1 and all η ∈ (0, 1/2)

We deduce that condition (3.1) is fulﬁlled by the process ¯uN . The next lemma
shows that uN and ¯uN are uniformly close on compact sets, so that (3.1) is also
fulﬁlled by the process uN , thus concluding the proof of tightness.

enough, and in turn, Jensen’s inequality ensures that it holds for all p ≥ 1. There-
fore, we are left with the proof of (3.5). We have
|uN (t, x) − ¯uN (t, x)| ≤ Xj,ℓ∈{0,1}
for all (t, x) ∈ Bi,k, all i ∈ N, all k ∈ {0, . . . , 2N − 1} and all N ≥ 1. There
are four terms in the sum. For each of them, the supremum over (t, x) ∈ Bi,k of
the corresponding increment is stochastically bounded by 2/(2N)(α∧1)/2 times a
Poisson r.v. with mean 1. Computing the p-th moment of the latter yields (3.5).

3.2 The Boltzmann-Gibbs principle
The next result is the main ingredient that we need for the identiﬁcation of the limit.
We will work at the level of the particle system η ∈ {0, 1}2N . Under the measure
νN deﬁned in (2.1), the η(k)’s are independent Bernoulli r.v. with parameter qN
k .
Let Ψ be a cylinder function, that is, there exists r ∈ N such that Ψ : {0, 1}r → R.
As soon as r ≤ 2N, we can deﬁne Ψ(η) = Ψ(η(1), . . . , η(r)). Then, we set
Ψ (η) := Ψ(η)− ˜ΨN −r ˜Ψ′N(η(1)−qN

2N (cid:17)(cid:17)2(cid:21) = 0 , α < 1 .

This type of result is classical in the literature on ﬂuctuations of particle systems.
However, our setting presents some speciﬁcities. First, our stationary measure is
not a product measure, but it can be obtained by conditioning the product measure
νN on the hyperplane of all conﬁgurations with N particles, as we did in Section 2.
Second, νN is the product of independent but non-identically distributed Bernoulli
measures; however the means of these Bernoulli measures vary “smoothly” in
space. Given these differences with the usual setting, we provide the details of
the proof, following the structure of the classical proof provided in [KL99, Thm
11.1.1]. We restrict ourselves to proving the case α < 1, as the case α ≥ 1 is
actually simpler.
Proof. Let A > 0 be such that supp ϕ ⊂ [−A, A]. We adopt the notation ϕ(k) for
ϕ((k − N)/(2N)α) for simplicity. An important argument in the proof will be the
uniform absolute continuity of µN w.r.t. νN , when the measures are restricted to
the ﬁltration generated by η(1), . . . , η(N + A(2N)α), see Corollary 2.6. To prove
the proposition, we let K be an integer and we decompose {N − A(2N)α, . . . , N +
A(2N)α} into M disjoint, consecutive boxes of size 2K + 1 (except the last box
that may be of smaller size), that we denote by Bi, i = 1 . . . M. Necessarily M is
of order N α/K. To each box Bi, we associate its interior B◦i as the subset of all
points in Bi which are at distance at least r + 1 from the complement of Bi. This
being given, we denote by Bc = ∪i(Bi\B◦i ). We also let ki be an arbitrary point
in Bi, for each i. Then, we write

The contribution to (3.6) of the ﬁrst two terms on the right can easily be proved to
vanish as N → ∞ and then K → ∞: the main ingredients are Jensen’s inequality
on the time integral, the absolute continuity of µN w.r.t. νN , the independence
of the η(i)’s under νN , the fact that the νN -expectation of V N
Ψ is zero and the
continuity of ϕ. Let us deal with the third term, which is more delicate. For each i,
we set ξi = (η(k), k ∈ Bi) and we let LN
be the generator of our process restricted
to Bi and not sped up by (2N)2α:

for the discrete L2 product, and

∇f (x) := f (x + (2N)−α) − f (x) , ∆f (x) := ∇f (x) − ∇f (x − (2N)−α) ,
for the discrete gradient and Laplacian. Let us state a classical result of the theory
of stochastic PDEs.

Proposition 3.5 (Martingale problem) Let (u(t, x), x ∈ R, t ≥ 0) be a continu-
ous process such that E[ku(0,·)k∞] < ∞ and for all ϕ ∈ C∞c (R), the processes
M(ϕ) and L(ϕ) are continuous martingales where

Then, u solves (1.7) started from the initial proﬁle u(0,·).
Proof of Theorem 1.4. We treat in details the case α < 1. We know that (uN )N≥1
is a tight sequence in D([0,∞),C(R)). Since the sizes of the jumps are vanish-
ing with N, any limit point lies in C([0,∞),C(R)). Let us consider an arbitrary
converging subsequence (uNi)i≥1 and let u be its limit. We only need to check
that u satisﬁes the Martingale problem of Proposition 3.5. Our starting point is
the stochastic differential equations solved by the discrete process. Namely, for all
ϕ ∈ C∞c (R), we set

Notice the similarity between M N (ϕ), LN (ϕ) and M(ϕ), L(ϕ). In order to pass
to the limit along the subsequence Ni, we need to deal with the indicators in the
expressions above. To that end, we set Ψ(η) = η(1)(1 − η(2)) + (1 − η(1))η(2),
which is nothing else than the indicator of the event {∆S(1) 6= 0}, and we aim at

4.1 The replacement lemma
In this subsection, we work at the level of the particle system ηt, t ≥ 0 where

ηt(k) =

1 + X(t(2N)(1+α)∧2, k)

.

2

Notice that our dynamics still makes sense when the total number of particles is
any integer between 0 and 2N.
Let r ≥ 1 be an integer and Φ : {0, 1}r → R. For all η ∈ {0, 1}2N and as soon as
2N ≥ r, we deﬁne

Φ(η) := Φ(η(1), . . . , η(r)) .

We also introduce the expectation of Φ under a product of Bernoulli measures with
parameter a ∈ [0, 1]:

˜Φ(a) := Xη∈{0,1}r

Φ(η)a#{i:η(i)=1}(1 − a)#{i:η(i)=0} .

HYDRODYNAMIC LIMIT

27

We let Tℓ(i) := {i − ℓ, i − ℓ + 1, . . . , i + ℓ} be the box of size 2ℓ + 1 around site i,
and for any sequence a(k), k ∈ Z, we deﬁne its average over Tℓ(i) as follows:

MTℓ(i)a :=

1

2ℓ + 1

i+ℓ

Xk=i−ℓ

a(k) .

Recall the shift operator τ· deﬁned in (1.18). We consider the sequence Φ(η)(k) :=
Φ(τkη) and the associated averages MTℓ(i)Φ(η). In the sequel, we will need a “re-
placement lemma” that bounds the following quantity

Vℓ(η) =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

MTℓ(0)Φ(η) − ˜Φ(cid:16)MTℓ(0)η(cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

.

The replacement lemma works for all initial conditions when α ≥ 1. On the other
hand, when α < 1, we make the following assumption.

Assumption 4.1 For all N ≥ 1, the initial condition ιN is a product measure on
{0, 1}2N of the form ⊗2N
k=1Be(f (k/2N)), where f : [0, 1] → [0, 1] is assumed to
be piecewise constant and does not depend on N .

We could probably relax this assumption, but it is sufﬁcient for our purpose.

Theorem 4.2 (Replacement lemma) Let α > 0 and let ιN be a measure on {0, 1}2N .
For α < 1, we suppose that Assumption 4.1 is fulﬁlled. For every δ > 0, we have

The proof of this theorem relies on the classical one-block and two-blocks esti-
mates. First, let us introduce the Dirichlet form associated to our dynamics:

DN (f ) = −Xη pf (η)LNpf(η) νN (η) ,

where f : {0, 1}2N → R+ and LN is the generator of our sped up process, that is

LN g(η) = (2N)(1+α)∧2

Xk=1

(g(ηk,k+1) − g(η))(pN η(k + 1)(1 − η(k))
+ (1 − pN ) η(k)(1 − η(k + 1))) ,

where ηk,k+1 is obtained from η by permuting the values at sites k and k + 1.
The reference measure in the Dirichlet form is taken to be νN , as deﬁned in Section
2, which is reversible for our dynamics. This is because we do not work only on
the hyperplane of conﬁgurations with N particles but on the whole set {0, 1}2N .
In the statements of the lemmas below, the function f will always be non-negative
and such that νN [f ] = 1.

The proof of this result is standard, we refer to [KOV89, Lemma 2.2] for instance,
or to [EL15, Lemma 23]. Actually, the case α ≥ 1 can be derived directly from
these references, while the case α < 1 is slightly different due the time-scaling
of our process. However, the arguments in the proof work verbatim up to simple
modiﬁcations.

In the case α ≥ 1, this two-blocks estimate is a classical result of the theory of hy-
drodynamic limits. We refer to Lemma 2.3 in Kipnis, Olla and Varadhan [KOV89]
for a very similar statement but for the WASEP with periodic boundary conditions,
or to Lemma 24 in [EL15].
In the case α < 1, the result is due to Rezakhan-
lou [Rez91, Sect. 6] when the lattice does not have boundaries: to adapt his proof
to our setting, it sufﬁces to use the coupling introduced in the forthcoming Subsec-
tion 4.3 and to apply the arguments presented in [Rez91, Lemma 6.6].

Lemma 4.4, we deduce that (4.5) goes to 0 as N → ∞, ǫ ↓ 0 and ℓ → ∞. This
concludes the proof.

4.2 Hydrodynamic limit: the parabolic case
The goal of this subsection is to prove Theorem 1.5: we will write PN for the law
of the process starting from an initial condition satisfying the hypothesis of that
theorem. Recall that we write mN (t, k) instead of mN (t, k/2N) for simplicity. To
prove tightness of the sequence mN in the Skorohod space D([0,∞),C([0, 1])), it
sufﬁces to show that the sequence mN (t = 0,·) is tight in C([0, 1]), and that we
have for any T > 0

The former is actually an hypothesis of our theorem. To prove the latter, we intro-
duce a piecewise linear time interpolation of mN , namely we set tN := ⌊t(2N)2⌋
and

¯mN (t,·) :=(tN + 1 − t(2N)2)mN(cid:16) tN
(2N)2 ,·(cid:17)
+ (t(2N)2 − tN )mN(cid:16) tN + 1

First, we control the distance between mN and ¯mN .

Lemma 4.5 For all T > 0, we have

N→∞

ENh sup

t∈[0,T ]kmN (t,·) − ¯mN (t,·)k∞i = 0 .

The proof of this lemma is almost the same as the proof of Lemma 3.3, so we omit
it. This result ensures that it is actually sufﬁcient to show (4.6) with mN replaced
by ¯mN in order to get tightness.
The following proposition ensures that ¯mN satisﬁes (4.6).

Proof. Let t′ > t. Given the expression (4.8), the increment mN (t′, ℓ) − mN (t, ℓ)
can be written as the sum of three terms: the contribution of the initial condition, of
the asymmetry and of the martingale terms. We bound separately the p-th moments
of these three terms. First, we let ¯pN be the fundamental solution of the discrete
heat equation on the whole line Z: contrary to pN , ¯pN is translation invariant. Let
us also extend mN into a function on the whole line Z: we simply consider the
4N-periodic, odd function that coincides with mN on [0, 2N]. By (6.11), we get

This result is immediate when α = 1 since, in that case, the scaling makes all the
discrete interfaces uniformly 1-Lipschitz.

Proof. It sufﬁces to establish the bound for x, y of the form ℓ/2N, ℓ′/2N since the
remaining cases follow by interpolation. Given the expression (4.8), the increment
mN (t, ℓ) − mN (t, ℓ′) can be written as the sum of three terms: the contribution
of the initial condition, of the asymmetry and of the martingale terms. We bound
separately the p-th moments of these three terms.

uniformly over the same set of parameters. Kolmogorov’s Continuity Theorem
then ensures that ¯mN admits a modiﬁcation satisfying the bound stated in Proposi-

coincides with its modiﬁcation PN -a.s., thus concluding the proof.

Proof of Theorem 1.5, α ∈ (1, 3/2). We already know that the sequence mN , N ≥
1 is tight. Let m be the limit of a converging subsequence. To conclude the proof,
we only need to show that for any ϕ ∈ C2([0, 1]) such that ϕ(0) = ϕ(1) = 0, we
have

One would like to pass to the limit on (4.10) along a converging subsequence: by
classical arguments, we get all the terms in (4.9) except the last term on the right
which needs some additional care. More precisely, we will show that the term
in (4.10) that contains an indicator, converges in probability to the last term on
the right of (4.9). To that end, we apply Theorem 4.2 with ℓ = 2 and Φ(η) =
η(1)(1 − η(2)) + (1 − η(1))η(2). Recall the one-to-one correspondence between
particle conﬁgurations η ∈ {0, 1}2N and discrete paths S(n), n ∈ [0, 2N]: given
this correspondence, Φ(η) is the indicator of the event {∆S(1) 6= 0}, and ˜Φ(a) =
2a(1 − a). Then, we observe that

By Theorem 4.2, this error term goes to 0 in probability as N → ∞ and ǫ ↓
0. Using the tightness of the sequence mN , we deduce that (4.11) converges to
th1, ϕi/2 in probability as N → ∞ and ǫ ↓ 0. Since (2pN − 1)(2N)α goes to
2σ as N → ∞, we deduce that the third term on the right hand side of (4.10)
converges in probability to σth1, ϕi as N → ∞, thus concluding the proof.
Proof of Theorem 1.5, α = 1. In that case, we characterise the limit via the Hopf-
Cole transform ξ(t, x) = exp(−2σm(t, x) + 2σ2t) that maps, formally, the PDE
(1.9) into

2 ∂2

(∂tξ = 1

xξ , x ∈ [0, 1] ,
ξ(t, 0) = ξ(t, 1) = e2σ2t ,

t > 0 ,
ξ(0,·) = e−2σm(0,·) .

(4.12)

This equation admits a unique weak solution in the space of continuous space-time
functions, and it is well-known that the unique weak solution of (1.9) coincides
with the latter solution upon reverse Hopf-Cole transform.
A famous result due to G¨artner [G¨ar88] shows that a similar transform, performed
at the level of the exclusion process, linearises the drift of the stochastic differential
equations solved by our discrete process. Namely, if one sets

γN =

cN =

and

ξN (t, x) := e−γN S(t(2N)2,2N x)+λN t , x ∈ [0, 1] ,

t ≥ 0 ,

then, using the abusive notation ξN (t, k) for ξN (t, x) when x = k/2N, we have

(dξN (t, k) = cN ∆ξN (t, k)dt + d ˜M N (t, k) ,

ξN (t, 0) = ξN (t, 1) = eλN t ,

where ∆ is the discrete Laplacian and M N (t, k) is a martingale with quadratic

The tightness of mN easily implies the tightness of ξN . It only remains to identify

ϕ(1) = 0, we have

It is elementary to check that there exists C > 0 such that |ξN (t, k)| ≤ C for all
t in a compact set of R+, all k ∈ {1, . . . , 2N − 1} and all N ≥ 1. Consequently
there exists C′ > 0 such that h ˜M N (·, k)it ≤ C′t uniformly over the same set
of parameters. Moreover, the jumps of this martingale are uniformly bounded by
some constant on the same set of parameters. Then, a simple calculation based on
(6.3) shows that for any given t ≥ 0, the moments of RN
t (ϕ) vanish as N → ∞.
Hence, any limit ξ of a converging subsequence of ξN satisﬁes

thus concluding the proof.

4.3 Hydrodynamic limit: the hyperbolic case
Deﬁnition 4.9 We say that η ∈ L∞((0,∞)×(0, 1)) is an entropy solution of (1.11)

and h±(η, c) := −2σ sgn±(η − c)(η(1 − η) − c(1 − c)).

There is existence and uniqueness of the entropy solution of (1.11), we refer for
instance to Vovelle [Vov02]. Notice that the meaning given to the boundary con-
ditions is not immediate in general. Actually, if η admits a trace on the boundary,
then the trace satisﬁes the so-called BLN conditions, see [BlRN79].

We let M([0, 1]) be the space of ﬁnite measures on [0, 1] endowed with the
topology of weak convergence. Recall that ̺N is the rescaled process of the density
of particles, deﬁned in (1.12).

Proposition 4.10 Let ιN be any measure on {0, 1}2N . The sequence of processes
(̺N
t , t ≥ 0), starting from ιN , is tight in the space D([0,∞),M([0, 1])). Further-
more, the associated sequence of processes (mN (t, x), t ≥ 0, x ∈ [0, 1]) is tight in
D([0,∞),C([0, 1])).
For a generic measure ιN on {0, 1}2N , mN (t, 1) is not necessarily equal to 0.
Proof. Let ϕ ∈ C2([0, 1]). It sufﬁces to show that h̺N

being given, the proof proceeds as in Subsection 4.2: one introduces a piecewise
linear time-interpolation ¯mN of mN and shows tightness for this process, and then
one shows that the difference between ¯mN and mN is uniformly small. We are left
with the proof of (4.15). Let ψ : R → R+ be a non-increasing, smooth function
such that ψ(x) = 1 for all x ≤ 0 and ψ(x) = 0 for all x ≥ 1. Fix β ∈ (α, 1).

uniformly over all k, all 0 ≤ s ≤ t ≤ T and all N ≥ 1. This yields (4.15).

The main step in the proof of Theorem 1.7 is to prove the convergence of the
density of particles, starting from a product measure satisfying Assumption 4.1.
This is the content of the following result.

Theorem 4.11 Let ιN be a measure satisfying Assumption 4.1, so that ̺N
0 under
ιN converges to some deterministic limit ̺0(dx) = η0(x)dx. Then, under PN
, the
ιN
process ̺N converges in distribution in the Skorohod space D([0,∞),M([0, 1]))
to the deterministic process (η(t, x)dx, t ≥ 0), where η is the entropy solution of
Deﬁnition 4.9 starting from η0.

Given this result, the proof of the hydrodynamic limit is simple.

Proof of Theorem 1.7. Let ιN be as in Theorem 4.11. We know that ̺N converges
to some limit ̺ and that mN is tight. Let m be some limit point and let mNi be
an associated converging subsequence. By Skorohod’s representation theorem, we
can assume that (̺Ni, mNi) converges almost surely to (̺, m). Recall that ̺ is of
the form ̺(t, x) = η(t, x)dx. Our ﬁrst goal is to show that m(t, x) =R x
0 (2η(t, y)−
1)dy for all t, x.
Fix x0 ∈ (0, 1). We introduce an approximation of the indicator of (−∞, x0] by
setting ϕp(·) = 1 −R ·
P1/p(y − x0)dy, p ≥ 1 where Pt is the heat kernel on R
at time t. This is a collection of smooth functions on R such that for any δ > 0

as p → ∞. If we set I(t, x0) = m(t, x0)−R x0

and some t > 0, then we have

t − 1, ϕpi| + 2|h̺N

t − ̺t, ϕpi|

Recall that mN is 1-Lipschitz in space, so that the second term on the right vanishes
as p → ∞ by (4.16). A discrete integration by parts shows that the third term
vanishes as N go to ∞. The ﬁrst and fourth terms vanish as N → ∞ by the

HYDRODYNAMIC LIMIT

39

convergence of mN and ̺N , and the last term is dealt with using (4.16). Choosing
p and then N large enough, we deduce that |I(t, x0)| is almost surely as small as
desired. This identiﬁes completely the limit m of any converging subsequence,
under PN
ιN

Since the wedge initial condition is deﬁned as the product of Bernoulli mea-
sures with mean 0 on the N ﬁrst sites, and 1 on the N last sites, we are in the scope
of Theorem 4.11, and consequently Theorem 1.7 is proved in this case.

.

On the other hand, when we start from the ﬂat initial condition, we need to
argue differently. Let m◦ be the integrated solution of the Burgers equation (1.11)
when the initial condition is taken to be η(t = 0, x) = 1/2: its expression is given
in (1.13). We know that mN is tight by Proposition 4.10 when starting from the
ﬂat initial condition, so we only need to show that any limit m coincides with m◦.
Let η+ (resp. η−) be the solution of (1.11) when the initial condition is taken to be
η+(t = 0, x) = 1 (resp. η−(t = 0, x) = 0) for all x ∈ [0, ǫ] and η±(t = 0, x) =
1/2 for all x ∈ [ǫ, 1]. Let m± be the corresponding integrated solutions. We check
in Appendix 6.3 that m− and m+ converge pointwise to m◦ as ǫ ↓ 0. Now, let ι+
(resp. ι−N ) be the product measure with mean +1 (resp. 0) on the ǫ2N ﬁrst sites,
and then with mean 1/2 on the remaining sites. The initial conditions ι±N fall into
the scope of Theorem 4.11 and the corresponding (integrated) scaling limits are
given by the deterministic processes m±. The key point is that the height function
N (resp. ι−N ) is, with a probability that goes to 1 when N → ∞,
associated with ι+
above (resp. below) the height function associated with the ﬂat initial condition.
It is easy to check that the dynamics preserves (stochastically) the ordering at any
time. Therefore, any limit m belongs to [m−, m+]. This ensures that m = m◦,
thus concluding the proof.

N

To prove Theorem 4.11, we need to show that the limit of any converging sub-
sequence of ̺N is of the form ̺(t, dx) = η(t, x)dx and that η satisﬁes the entropy
inequalities of Deﬁnition 4.9. To make appear the constant c in these inequalities,
the usual trick is to deﬁne a coupling of the particle system ηN with another parti-
cle system ζ N which is stationary with density c so that, at larger scales, one can
replace the averages of ζ N by c. Such a coupling has been deﬁned by Rezakhan-
lou [Rez91] in the case of the inﬁnite lattice Z. The speciﬁcity of the present setting
comes from the boundary conditions of our system: one needs to choose carefully
the ﬂux of particles at 1 and 2N for ζ N .

The precise deﬁnition of our coupling goes as follows. We set

p(1) = 1 − pN , p(−1) = pN ,

and

p(k) = 0 ∀k 6= {−1, 1} ,

as well as b(a, a′) = a(1 − a′). Then, we deﬁne

+ (b(ζ(k), ζ(ℓ)) − b(η(k), η(ℓ)) ∧ b(ζ(k), ζ(ℓ)))(f (η, ζ k,ℓ) − f (η, ζ))i ,

HYDRODYNAMIC LIMIT

40

and, using the notation ζ ± δk to denote the particle conﬁguration which coincides
with ζ everywhere except at site k where the occupation is ζ(k) ± 1,

˜Lbdryf (η, ζ) = (2N)1+α(2pN − 1)(1 − c)ζ(1)(f (η, ζ − δ1) − f (η, ζ))

+ (2N)1+α(2pN − 1)c(1 − ζ(2N))(f (η, ζ + δ2N ) − f (η, ζ)) .

We consider the stochastic process (ηN
t ), t ≥ 0 associated to the generator
˜L = ˜Lbulk + ˜Lbdry. From now on, we will always assume that ηN
0 has law ιN , where
ιN satisﬁes Assumption 4.1, and that ζ N
0 is distributed as a product of Bernoulli
measures with parameter c. Furthermore, we will always assume that the coupling
at time 0 is such that

t , ζ N

sgn(ηN

0 (k) − ζ N

0 (k)) = sgn(f (k/2N) − c) , ∀k ∈ {1, . . . , 2N} ,

where f is the macroscopic density proﬁle arising in Assumption 4.1. Notice that
this is always possible to construct such a coupling. We let ˜PN
ιN ,c be the law of the
process (ηN , ζ N ).

Remark 4.12 The bulk part of the generator prescribes the dynamics of the simple
exclusion process for both particle systems. The coupling is such that the order of
ζ N and ηN is preserved: this is the reason why the expression of the generator is
non-trivial. The boundary part of the generator prescribes the minimal jump rates
for ζ N to be stationary with density c: there is no ﬂux from 0 to 1 nor from 2N
to 2N + 1. It appears that this choice is convenient for establishing the entropy
inequalities.

It will actually be important to track the sign changes in the pair (ηN , ζ N ). To that
end, we let Fk,ℓ(η, ζ) = 1 if η(k) ≥ ζ(k) and η(ℓ) ≥ ζ(ℓ); and Fk,ℓ(η, ζ) = 0
otherwise. We say that a subset C of consecutive integers in {1, . . . , 2N} is a
cluster with constant sign if for all k, ℓ ∈ C we have Fk,ℓ(η, ζ) = 1, or for all
k, ℓ ∈ C we have Fk,ℓ(ζ, η) = 1. For a given conﬁguration (η, ζ), we let n be
the minimal number of clusters needed to cover {1, . . . , 2N}: we will call n the
number of sign changes. There is not necessarily a unique choice of covering into
n clusters. Let C(i), i ≤ n be any such covering and let 1 = k1 < k2 < . . . kn <
kn+1 = 2N + 1 be the integers such that C(i) = {ki, ki+1 − 1}.
Lemma 4.13 Under ˜PN
stationary with law ⊗2N
smaller than n(0) + 3 at all time t ≥ 0.
Proof. It is simple to check the assertion on the laws of the marginals ηN and ζ N .
Regarding the number of sign changes, the key observation is the following. In the
bulk {2, . . . , 2N −1}, to create a new sign change we need to have two consecutive
sites k, ℓ such that ηN (k) = ζ N (k) = 1, ηN (ℓ) = ζ N (ℓ) = 0 and we need to let
one particle jump from k to ℓ, but not both. However, our coupling does never
allow such a jump. Therefore, the number of sign changes can only increase at the
boundaries due to the interaction of ζ N with the reservoirs: this can create at most
2 new sign changes, thus concluding the proof.

while the process ζ N is
ιN ,c, the process ηN has law PN

Assumption 4.1 ensures the existence of a constant C > 0 such that n(0) < C
almost surely for all N ≥ 1. We now derive the entropy inequalities at the mi-
croscopic level. Recall that τk stands for the shift operator with periodic boundary
conditions, and let hu, viN = (2N)−1P2N

subscript s in the calculations. Moreover, we write ϕ(k) instead of ϕ(k/2N) to
simplify notations. We treat separately the boundary part and the bulk part of the
generator. Regarding the former, we have

˜Lbdryhϕ(·), (η(·) − ζ(·))+iN
= (2N)α(2pN − 1)(cid:16)ϕ(1)η(1)ζ(1)(1 − c) − ϕ(2N)η(2N)(1 − ζ(2N))c(cid:17)
≤ 2σϕ(0)(1 − c) + O(N−α) ,

since ϕ is non-negative and 2pN − 1 ∼ 2σ(2N)−α. Similarly, we ﬁnd
˜Lbdryhϕ(·), (η(·) − ζ(·))−iN ≤ 2σϕ(2N)(0 − c)− + O(N−α) .

We turn to the bulk part of the generator. Recall the map Fk,ℓ(η, ζ), and set
Gk,ℓ(η, ζ) = 1− Fk,ℓ(η, ζ)Fk,ℓ(ζ, η). By checking all the possible cases, one easily
gets the following identity
˜Lbulk(η(k) − ζ(k))+ = (2N)1+αXℓ (cid:20)(cid:16)p(ℓ − k)(b(ζ(k), ζ(ℓ)) − b(η(k), η(ℓ)))

−(cid:16)p(ℓ − k)b(η(k), η(ℓ)) + p(k − ℓ)b(ζ(ℓ), ζ(k))(cid:17)Gk,ℓ(η, ζ)(cid:21) .
Since η and ζ play symmetric rˆoles in ˜Lbulk, we can ﬁnd a similar identity for
˜Lbulk(η(k) − ζ(k))−. Notice that the term on the third line is non-positive, so we
will drop it in the inequalities below. We thus get

˜Lbulkhϕ(·), (η(·) − ζ(·))±iN ≤ (2N)α

Up to now, we essentially followed the calculations made in the ﬁrst step of the
proof of [Rez91, Thm 3.1]. At this point, we argue differently: we decompose
p(±1) into the symmetric part 1 − pN , which is of order 1/2, and the asymmetric
part which is either 0 or 2pN − 1 ∼ 2σ(2N)−α.
We start with the contribution of the symmetric part. Recall the deﬁnition of the
number of sign changes n and of the integers k1 < . . . < kn+1. Using a discrete
integration by parts, one easily deduces that for all i ≤ n
Xk,ℓ=ki

(ϕ(k) − ϕ(ℓ))I±k,ℓ(η, ζ) =

Since n(s) is bounded uniformly over all N ≥ 1 and all s ≥ 0, we deduce that the
boundary terms arising at the second and third lines yield a negligible contribution.
Thus we ﬁnd

To prove Theorem 1.8, we follow the method of Bertini and Giacomin [BG97].
Due to our boundary conditions, there are two important steps that need some
speciﬁc arguments: ﬁrst the bound on the moments of the discrete process, see
Proposition 5.3, second the bound on the error terms arising in the identiﬁcation of
the limit, see Proposition 5.7.

In order to simplify the notations, we will regularly use the microscopic vari-
ables k, ℓ ∈ {1, . . . , 2N − 1} in rescaled quantities: for instance, hN (t, ℓ) stands
for hN (t, x) with x = (ℓ− N)/(2N)2α. The proof relies on the discrete Hopf-Cole
transform, which was introduced by G¨artner [G¨ar88]. The important feature of this
transform is that it linearises the drift terms of the stochastic differential equations
solved by the discrete process. Indeed, if one sets ξN (t, x) := exp(−hN (t, x)),
where hN was introduced in (1.14), then the stochastic differential equations solved
by ξN are given by

dξN (t, ℓ) = cN ∆ξN (t, ℓ)dt + dM N (t, ℓ) ,
ξN (t, 0) = ξN (t, 2N) = eλN t ,
ξN (0, ℓ) = e−hN (0,ℓ) ,

window, the density is approximately 1, and on the right it is approximately 0. For

Lemma 5.1 Fix a compact set K ⊂ [0, T ) and ǫ > 0. There exists δ > 0 such
that |ξN,◦(t, ℓ) − 1| . exp(−δN 2α) uniformly over all t ∈ K, all ℓ ∈ BN

bN (t, ℓ) := 2 + exp(cid:16)λN t − γN (ℓ ∧ (2N − ℓ))(cid:17) ,

then for N large enough, we have ξN,◦(t, ℓ) ≤ bN (t, ℓ) for all t ∈ K and all
ℓ ∈ {1, . . . , 2N − 1}.
The value 2 in the expression of bN could be replaced by any arbitrary value strictly
larger than 1.

Remark 5.2 The hydrodynamic limit of Theorem 1.5, upon Hopf-Cole transform,

is given by 1 ∨ exp(cid:16)λN t − γN (ℓ ∧ (2N − ℓ))(cid:17).

We turn to the second part of the statement. Using the estimate on ξN,◦(t, N)

bN (t, 0) ≥ ξN,◦(t, 0) ,



By the maximum principle, one deduces that bN (t, ℓ) ≥ ξN,◦(t, ℓ) for all t ∈ K and
all ℓ ∈ {0, . . . , N}. By symmetry, this inequality also holds for ℓ ∈ {N, . . . , 2N}.

5.1 Tightness
We now establish some estimates on the moments of time and space increments.
The following two lemmas are similar to Lemmas 4.2 and 4.3 in [BG97].

Lemma 5.4 Fix ǫ > 0, β ∈ (0, 1/2) and a compact set K ⊂ [0, T ). For any n ≥ 1,
we have

uniformly over all t ∈ K, all ℓ, ℓ′ ∈ BN
Proof. The expression (5.4) yields three terms for ξN (t, ℓ) − ξN (t, ℓ′). By Lemma
5.1, the ﬁrst term can be bounded by a term of order exp(−δN 2α) which is negli-
gible compared to (|ℓ − ℓ′|/(2N)2α)β whenever ℓ 6= ℓ′. The second term arising
from (5.4) is bounded by 1 − exp(−γN ), which is smaller than (|ℓ − ℓ′|/(2N)2α)β
whenever ℓ 6= ℓ′. Therefore, to complete the proof of the lemma, we only need
t(ℓ, ℓ′), where we have
to establish the appropriate bound for the 2n-th moment Rt
introduced the martingale

Proposition 5.6 Fix t0 ∈ [0, T ). The sequence ξN is tight in D([0, t0],C(R)), and
any limit is continuous in time.

(2N)4α ,·(cid:17) + (t(2N)4α− tN )ξN(cid:16) tN + 1

Proof. One introduces a piecewise linear time-interpolation ¯ξN of our process ξN ,
namely we set tN := ⌊t(2N)4α⌋ and
¯ξN (t,·) := (tN + 1− t(2N)4α)ξN(cid:16) tN
(2N)4α ,·(cid:17) .
Using Lemmas 5.4 and 5.5, it is simple to show that the space-time H¨older semi-
norm of ¯ξN on compact sets of [0, T ) × R has ﬁnite moments of any order, uni-
formly over all N ≥ 1. Additionally, the proof of Lemma 4.7 in [BG97] carries
through, and ensures that ξN − ¯ξN converges to 0 uniformly over compact sets
of [0, T ) × R in probability. All these arguments provide the required control on
the space-time increments of ξN to ensure its tightness, following the calculation
below Proposition 4.9 in [BG97].

5.2 A delicate estimate
The goal of this section is to establish the following result, which is the analogue
of Lemma 4.8 in [BG97]. We will use this bound to control error terms arising in
the identiﬁcation of the limit.

Proposition 5.7 There exists κ > 0 such that for all A > 0, we have

Eh|E[∇+ξN (t, ℓ)∇−ξN (t, ℓ)|Fs]|i .

uniformly over all ℓ ∈ [N − A(2N)2α, N + A(2N)2α], all t in a compact set of

Remark 5.8 Quastel suggested in [Qua12] a proof of such a bound via a replace-
ment lemma: this is the approach that Dembo and Tsai [DT16] followed in the
context of the weakly asymmetric non-simple exclusion process on Z. It is not
clear whether one can follow this approach in our setting.

To prove this proposition, we need to collect some preliminary results. First, we
set

˜ξN (t, ℓ) := ξN,◦(t, ℓ) +

pN
t (k, ℓ)(ξN (0, k) − 1) ,

and we observe that

By Lemma 5.10, we already know that DN

ment of Proposition 5.7. To conclude the proof of the proposition, we only need to
show that this is also the case for the sum over n ≥ 1 of Is(t, ℓ, n).
Fix A > 0. Let n0 = c log N, for an arbitrary c > −3α/ log β, where β < 1
is taken from Lemma 5.9. Using Lemmas 5.10 and 5.9, we easily deduce that
Is(t, ℓ, n) . βn uniformly over all n ≥ 1, all ℓ ∈ {N − A(2N)2α, N + A(2N)2α}

If we restrict the domain of integration to those t1 such that t1−s ≥ (t−s)/(n+1),

Finally, we set Bs(t, ℓ, n) := Is(t, ℓ, n) − As(t, ℓ, n). As for the previous term, we
can replace each occurrence of pN by ¯pN up to a negligible term, using Lemma
6.5. Among the parameters k1, . . . , kn involved in the deﬁnition of Bs(t, ℓ, n),
at least one them, say ki0, belongs to BN

the latter is negligible w.r.t. (2N)−3α, uniformly over the same set of parameters.
This concludes the proof.

5.3 Identiﬁcation of the limit
We use the notation hf, gi to denote the inner product of f and g in L2(R). Simi-
larly, for all maps f, g : [0, 2N] → R, we set

To conclude the proof of Theorem 1.8, it sufﬁces to show that any limit point ξ
of a converging subsequence of ξN satisﬁes the following martingale problem (see
Proposition 4.11 in [BG97]).

Deﬁnition 5.11 (Martingale problem) Let (ξ(t, x), t ∈ [0, T ), x ∈ R) be a con-
tinuous process satisfying the following two conditions. Let t0 ∈ [0, T ). First,
there exists a > 0 such that

sup

sup

e−a|x|E[ξ(0, x)2] < ∞ .

Second, for all ϕ ∈ C∞c (R), the processes

are local martingales on [0, t0]. Then, ξ is a solution of (1.5) on [0, T ).

The ﬁrst condition is a simple consequence of Proposition 5.3. To prove that the
second condition is satisﬁed, we introduce the discrete analogues of the above
processes. For all ϕ ∈ C∞c (R), the processes

passing to the limit on a converging subsequence, we easily deduce that the martin-

A(2N)2α] where A is a large enough value such that [−A, A] contains the support
of ϕ. The moments of ξN on this interval are of order 1 thanks to Proposition 5.3.

thus yielding the ﬁrst bound. To get the second bound, it sufﬁces to use the Fourier
decomposition of ¯pN

t−s(·)eγN ·.

We also recall a simple bound on the heat kernel, in the ﬂavour of large devia-

tions techniques. For all a > 0, t > 0 and N ≥ 1, we have

¯pN
t (k) ≤ e

2tcN g( a

2cN t ) ,

Xk≥a

(6.9)

where g(x) = cosh(argsh x)− x argsh x− 1 for all x ∈ R. By studying the function
g(x)/x, one easily deduces that the term on the r.h.s. is increasing with t.
We let ¯qN

s,t(k, ℓ) := ¯pN

t−s(k, ℓ)bN (s, k).

Lemma 6.4 Fix a compact set K ⊂ [0, T ) and ǫ > 0. There exists δ > 0 such that

uniformly over all k /∈ BN
Proof. Let us consider the case where bN (s, k) ≥ 3; by symmetry we can assume
that k ∈ {1, . . . , N}. Then, we apply (6.9) to get
2(t−s)cN g(

2cN (t−s) )+λN s−γN k

t−s(ℓ − k)eλN s−γN k ≤ e

We argue differently according to the value of α. If 4α ≤ 1, then (ℓ − k)/cN is
bounded away from 0 uniformly over all N ≥ 1, all k /∈ Bǫ/2(s) and all ℓ ∈ Bǫ(t).
Using the concavity of g, we deduce that there exists d > 0 such that the logarithm
of the r.h.s. of (6.10) is bounded by

−d(ℓ − k) + λN s − γN k . −dǫ

,

thus concluding the proof in that case.
We now treat the case 4α > 1. Let η > 0. First, we assume that s ∈ [0, t − η]. For

any c > 1/4!, we have g(x) ≤ −x2/2 + cx4 for all x in a neighbourhood of the
origin. Then, for N large enough we bound the logarithm of the r.h.s. of (6.10) by

(ℓ − k)4
(2cN (t − s))3 + λN s − γN k .

A tedious but simple calculation shows the following. There exists δ′ > 0, only
depending on ǫ, such that sups∈[0,t−η] f (s) ≤ −δ′N 2α for all N large enough. This
ensures the bound of the statement in the case where s ∈ [0, t − η].
Using the monotonicity in t of (6.9), we easily deduce that for all s ∈ [t− η, t], we
have

t−s(ℓ − k)eλN s−γN k ≤ ef(t−η)+λN (s−t+η) .
¯pN

Recall that λN ∼ N 2α. Choosing η < δ′ small enough and applying the bound
obtained above, we deduce that the statement of the lemma holds true.
The case where bN (s, k) is smaller than 3 is simpler, one can adapt the above
arguments to get the required bound.

k=1 pN

Proof of (5.6). The quantity 1 −P2N−1
t−s(k, ℓ) is equal to the probability that
a simple random walk, sped up by 2cN and started from ℓ, has hit 0 or 2N by time
t − s. By the reﬂexion principle, this is smaller than twice
¯pN
t−s(k) .

¯pN

t−s(k) + Xk≥2N−ℓ

We restrict ourselves to bounding the ﬁrst term, since one can proceed similarly
for the second term. Using (6.9), we deduce that it sufﬁces to bound exp(2(t −
s)cN g(ℓ/(2(t − s)cN )) + λN s). This is equal to the l.h.s. of (6.10) when k = 0, so
that the required bound follows from the arguments presented in the last proof.

Finally, we rely on the following representation of pN:

pN

t (k, ℓ) =Xj∈Z

t (k + j4N − ℓ) − ¯pN

t (−k + j4N − ℓ) .

The next lemma shows that pN

Lemma 6.5 Fix ǫ > 0 and a compact set K ⊂ [0, T ). There exists δ > 0 such

Proof. We only consider the case where bN (s, k) > 3 since the other case is sim-
pler. Observe that there exists C > 0 such that log bN (s, k) ≤ CN 2α for all s ∈ K
and all k ∈ {1, . . . , 2N − 1}. Arguing differently according to the relative values
of 4α and 1, and using the bound (6.9), we deduce that there exists j0 ≥ 1 such
that

uniformly over all s ≤ t ∈ K, all k ∈ {1, . . . , 2N − 1} and all ℓ ∈ Bǫ(t). On the
other hand, the arguments in the proof of Lemma 6.4 yield that

uniformly over all ℓ ∈ Bǫ(t), all t ∈ K and all N ≥ 1. Lemma A.3 in [BG97]
ensures that the ﬁrst term on the r.h.s. is smaller than some β′ ∈ (0, 1). Since the
second term vanishes as N → ∞, the bound of the statement follows.
6.3 Explicit solutions to the Burgers equation
Joseph and Veerappa Gowda [JVG92] have an “explicit” formula for the solution
of the Burgers equation on a bounded interval. After some tedious, but simple,
calculations one can get the following expressions. For simplicity, we take σ =
1/2.
We consider the ǫ-approximations of the ﬂat initial condition:
let η+(0, x) = 1
(resp. η−(0, x) = 0) on [0, ǫ] and η±(0, x) = 1/2 on [ǫ, 1]. Regarding η−, we have

From there, we can compute the expression of the corresponding integrated solu-
tion. In particular, for all t ≥ 4ǫ we have m−(t, x) = x ∧ ( t
2 − ǫ) ∧ (1 − x − ǫ),
while m+(t, x) = x∧ ( t
2 + ǫ)∧ (1− x + ǫ) for all t ≥ 0. This ensures that m±(t, x)
converges pointwise as ǫ ↓ 0 to m◦(t, x) = x ∧ (1 − x).
