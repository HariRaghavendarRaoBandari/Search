In this work, the K ¯K∗ interaction is studied in a quasipotential Bethe-Salpeter equation approach. With
the help of the SU(3) symmetric Lagrangian, not only the Weinberg-Tomozawa term but also the one-boson
exchange are considered to describe the K ¯K∗ interaction. The poles of scattering amplitude are searched to
ﬁnd the molecular state produced from the K ¯K∗ interaction. For quantum number IG(JPC) = 0+(1++), a pole is
found with reasonable cutoﬀ, which can be related to the f1(1285) in experiment. Another two molecular bound
states with 0−(1+−) and 1−(1++) are also produced from the K ¯K∗ interaction. Generally, for the K ¯K∗ interaction
considered in this work, contribution from Weinberg-Tomozawa term is larger than that from the one-boson
exchange. However, the latter manifests itself by aﬀecting the position of the poles and producing a molecular
state with 0−(1+−) where the Weinberg-Tomozawa term is absent.

INTRODUCTION

After observation of the exotic resonance structure X(3872)
near the D ¯D∗ threshold, more and more XYZ particles, which
can not be interpreted in the traditional quark model, are ob-
served near the thresholds of two heavy mesons. It suggests
there maybe exist a close relation between the XYZ parti-
cles and charmed (bottomed) meson and anti-charmed (anti-
bottomed) meson interactions, which has attracted many at-
tentions. For example, in the charmed sector, besides the
X(3872), the Zc(3900) and the Zb(10610) are often interpreted
as the D ¯D∗ and the B ¯B∗ molecular states, respectively. It is in-
teresting to see whether it can be extended to the strange sec-
tor, i e., whether there exist the strange partners of the XYZ
particles from the K ¯K∗ interaction.

There already exist some proposals of the molecular state
in the strange sector. Some observed mesons, such as the
f1(1285), was suggested to be from the K ¯K∗ interaction.
The f1(1285) is an axial-vector state with quantum number
IG(JPC) = 0+(1++), mass m = 1281.9 ± 0.5 MeV, and width
In recent years, however, it has
Γ = 24.2 ± 1.1 MeV [1].
been suggested to be a dynamically generated state made from
the K ¯K∗ interaction [2, 3] . Such a picture has been exten-
sively tested in the past decade [4, 5]. In Ref. [5], the K ¯K∗
interaction was studied in the f1(1285) channel in a chiral
unitary approach. The result showed that the f1(1285) ap-
pears as a bound state in the dynamical picture. The experi-
mental width can be obtained from considering other coupled
channels without aﬀecting its nature being dominantly a K ¯K∗
bound state [6].

Recently, the COMPASS collaboration at CERN observed
a narrow IG JPC = 1−(1++) signal in the f0(980)π channel, and
identiﬁed a new a1 state with mass m = 1414+15
−13 MeV and
width Γ = 153+8
−23 MeV. The a1(1420) mass peak is just above

the K∗ ¯K threshold about 1390 MeV [7]. It may suggest the
a1(1420) is a resonance from the K∗ ¯K interaction.

To study the nature of the f1(1280), the a1(1420) and other
states near K ¯K∗ threshold, we should construct the K ¯K∗ inter-
action and search the molecular state from such interaction.
In the chiral unitary approach a chiral invariant Lagrangian is
adopted and the tree level Weinberg-Tomozawa interaction are
derived to describing the interaction [3], which is consistent
with the treatment in the charmed sector in the chiral unitary
approach where only the Weinberg-Tomozawa interaction is
kept with an argument that the meson-exchange contributions
are small [8]. However, in the study of the XYZ particles the
one-boson exchange is widely adopted to study the molecular
state [9].

Combined with the one-boson-exchange model, a quasipo-
tential Beth-Salpeter equation approach, which keeps rela-
tivistic and unitary, was proposed and developed in the lit-
erature to deal with the hadron-hadron interaction and the
relevant hadronic molecular state, such as the Y(4274), the
Σc(3250), and the N(1875) [10–13]. In those works quasipo-
tential Beth-Salpeter equation for the vertex were solved to
ﬁnd the bound state solution which is related to the hadronic
molecular state. It can be seen as a relativistic version of the
non-relativistic one-boson-exchange model [14].

In Ref. [15], it was extended to study the scattering ampli-
tude to ﬁnd a pole in the second Riemann sheet produced from
the D ¯D∗ interaction, which is related to the Zc(3900) observed
at BESIII. The relevant invariant mass spectrum from BESIII
was also well reproduced. Both light meson exchange and J/ψ
exchange, which is related to the Weinberg-Tomozawa term
in the chiral unitary approach [8], were included in Ref. [15].
The larger mass of J/ψ meson ensures that the J/ψ exchange
potential can be reduced to a Weinberg-Tomozawa term by
dropping the exchange-momentum term q2 in the dominator
of the propagator [15]. It was found that though the J/ψ me-
son exchange is more important as suggested in the chiral uni-
tary approach the light meson exchange also provides consid-
erable contribution. In literature, it was also suggested that

the Weinberg-Tomozawa term can be reduced from the vector
meson exchange, such as ρ meson, in the strange sector [5].
However, the mass of exchanged vector meson in the strange
sector, ρ, ω or φ meson, which correponds to J/ψ meson ex-
change, is much lighter, and even comparable to the mass of
pesudoscalar η meson. One may wonder whether the vector
meson exchange in the strange sector can be reduced to the
Weinberg-Tomozawa term as in the charmed sector. Here, we
will consider both the one-boson exchange and the Weinberg-
Tomozawa term to describe the K ¯K∗ interaction. The molec-
ular state produced will be investigated, and the roles played
by one-boson exchange and Weinberg-Tomozawa term will be
discussed in a quasipotential Bethe-Salpeter approach.

This work is organized as follows. In the next section, the
SU(3) symmetric Lagrangians are presented and adopted to
derive the potential from the K ¯K∗ interaction. Both the one-
boson exchange and the Weinberg-Tomozawa term are con-
sidered to describing the K ¯K∗ interaction. In Sec III, the scat-
tering amplitude is obtained through solving the quasipoten-
tional Bethe-Saltpeter equation with the potential obtained in
section II, and the molecular state from the K ¯K∗ interaction
will be explored by searching poles from the scattering ampli-
tude. In the last section, a brief summary is given.

II. LAGRANGIAN AND K ¯K∗ INTERACTION

In the study of the D ¯D∗ interaction and the relevant
Zc(3900) as a hadronic molecular state, the heavy quark ef-
fective theory was adopted to derive the potential [15]. Since
the strange quark is much lighter than the heavy quark, so in
the strange sector, the heavy quark symmetry is not a good
symmetry. At the same time, SU(3) symmetry should be a
better symmetry for strange meson than the heavy quark sym-
metry. Hence, in this work, the SU(3) symmetric Lagrangians
will be adopted [16–19],

LPPV = ig T r(∂µP[P, Vµ]),
LVVP = −C ǫµναβT r(∂µVν∂αVβP),
LVVV = ig T r(∂µV ν[Vµ, Vν]),

We would like to note that here we use the deﬁnition K(∗)− =

With above Lagrangians and wave functions, the potential
for certain state from the one-boson exchange can be obtained
analogously to the D ¯D∗ interaction [21, 22]. There are two
types of diagram, direct diagram and cross diagram as shown
in Table I. We would like to note that the cross diagram is not
a u-channel contribution, but a deformation of the t channel
under SU(3) symmetry as discussed in Ref. [14]. With such
categorization, the potential from one-boson exchange is writ-
ten as

with k1 and m1 being the momentum and mass of the charmed
meson. The interested reader is referred to Ref. [15] for fur-
ther information about the regularization.

The integral equation will be solved by transforming the
integral equation through discreting the momenta p, p′ and
p′′ with the Gauge quadrature. In the current work, the cou-
pling constant in the Lagrangians in Eqs. (1-4) are determined
by SU(3) symmetry, so free parameters are two cutoﬀs intro-
duced in the form factors.
In previous works [15, 25], we
choose one value for two cutoﬀs. Here, we take the state with
quantum number IG(JPC) = 0+(1++) as an example to show
explicit eﬀect of two cutoﬀs on the results. As mentioned in
previous section, the cutoﬀ for the meson exchange Λ ∼ 2
GeV, which is estimated by the radii of the K and K∗ meson.
So, we vary it in a range from 1.5 to 2.5 GeV. The cutoﬀ Λ in
propagator G0 corresponds to the cutoﬀ of the momentum p
in the chiral unitary approach with a cutoﬀ regularization [3],
and is taken as a free parameters in this work. With varia-
tion of two cutoﬀs, bound state can be found from the K ¯K∗
interaction and results are shown in Fig. 1.

where mP and mV are the masses of exchanged pesudoscalar
and vector mesons, respectively. The momenta for exchanged
meson are deﬁned as q = k′2 − k2 and q = k′1 − k2 for direct
and cross diagrams, respectively. It is easy to see that no sin-
gularity will appear in the direct diagram. In the propagator
of the meson exchange for the cross diagram a replacement
q2 → −|q2| need to be made to remove the singularity from
the alternation of two ﬁnal particles as done in Ref. [23, 24].
A form factor is introduced to compensate the oﬀ-shell eﬀect
of exchanged meson as f (q2) = ( Λ2
)4. The form factor
Λ2
OBE +|q2|
for exchanged meson can be related to the radii of the K and
K∗ meson, about 0.5 fm, which leads to a cutoﬀ ΛOBE ∼ 2
GeV.
Besides the meson-exchange interaction, we also consider
the Weinberg-Tomozawa term, which is used in the chiral uni-
tary approach. The explicit of the the Weinberg-Tomozawa
term derived from the SU(3) symmetric Lagrangians in Eq. (4)
is of a form

(13)

where ﬂavor factors IWT = 4c − 2 and 6c − 6 for I = 1 and
0, respectively. It is diﬀerent from the one used in the chiral
unitary approach [3]. However with a simple numerical cal-
culation, one can ﬁnd that it is very close to the one used in
chiral unitary approach near the K ¯K∗ threshold.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In the current work a Bethe-Saltpeter approach with a spec-
tator quasipotential approximation will be adopted to search
the molecular state from the K ¯K∗ interaction. The method
was explained explicitly in the appendixes of Ref. [15]. The
molecular bound state or molecular resonance state produced
from the K ¯K∗ interaction corresponds to the pole of the scat-
tering amplitude M below or above threshold, respectively.
The quasipotential Bethe-Saltpeter equation for partial-wave
amplitude with ﬁxed spin-parity JP reads [15, 25],

At ﬁrst sight, one can ﬁnd that the pole will leave the thresh-
old with the increase of the cutoﬀ Λ for the propagator G0

while the result is not sensitive to the cutoﬀ ΛOBE for the one-
boson exchange in a range of 1 GeV. So, the cutoﬀ ΛOBE can
be safely ﬁxed at certain value, such as 2 GeV here, without
loss of generality. The experimental mass of the f1(1285),
1281.9±0.5 MeV, can be obtained with a cutoﬀ Λ about 0.95
GeV, which is close to the typical value to the exponential
from factor, 1 GeV. So, the results in this work support the
K ¯K∗ molecular state assignment of the f1(1285).

As shown above,

the f1(1285) with quantum number
IG(JPC) = 0+(1++) can be reproduced with a cutoﬀ Λ = 0.95
GeV. In the following, we will investigate all quantum num-
bers with J = 0 and 1 with a ﬁxed ΛOBE = 2.0 GeV and Λ in
a range from 0.7 to 1.8 GeV. The numerical calculation sug-
gests that besides the state related to the f1(1285) the molec-
ular states can be produced in other two cases with JP = 1+,
that is, 0+(1+−) and 1−(1++). It is interesting to remind that
spin party JP = 1+ corresponds to S and D waves for orbital
angular momentum while other spin parties correspond to P
and higher waves. So the results indict the S wave contribu-
tion is dominant in the K ¯K∗ interaction, which is adopted in
the chiral unitary approach [3]. In the following Table II, we
present the pole position with diﬀerent cutoﬀ Λ.

TABLE II. The pole position z with diﬀerent cutoﬀ Λ. The second
and third columns are for full model, and forth and ﬁfth columns
for OBE model with one-boson exchange only, and sixth to seventh
columns for WT model with Weinberg-Tomozawa term only. The
cutoﬀ Λ and energy W are in units of GeV.

rapidly with continues decrease of the cutoﬀ. The result in
the WT model is close to that in full model while if removing
the Weinberg-Tomozawa term from full model, larger cutoﬀ
is needed to produce a pole. It suggests that both one-boson
exchange and the Weinberg-Tomozawa term provide an at-
traction, and the latter plays a more important role in the K ¯K∗
interaction in the case with quantum number 0+(1++).

In the case with quantum number 0+(1+−), the negative par-
ity suggests the absence of the Weinberg-Tomozawa term be-
cause the ﬂavor factor becomes zero for I = 1 and c = + as
shown in Eq. (13). In this case, full model is equivalent to
the OBE model. With the one-boson exchange, a pole can be
found with a cutoﬀ around 1.2 GeV. In the Review of Particle
physics (PDG), a h1(1380) is listed with mass m = 1386±19
MeV. Such state was also produced from the K ¯K∗ interaction
in the chiral unitary approach as a pole at 1244-i0 MeV [6].
The relation between the pole and experimentally observed
h1(1380) need further studies in both experiment and theory.
In the case with quantum number 1+(1++), poles can be
found in full model and the WT model. The one-boson ex-
change leads to a repulsion in the K ¯K∗ interaction so that there
is no pole produced. The repulsive one-boson exchange also
results in that a larger cutoﬀ is needed to produce a pole at
certain position in full model than in the WT model. In full
model, a resonance can be produced from the K ¯K∗ interac-
tion with a cutoﬀ Λ = 1.4 GeV. However, it will die away
rapidly with the decrease of the cutoﬀ before reaching 1414
MeV, which is the experimental mass of the a1(1420).

In this work, the K ¯K∗ interaction is studied in a quasipo-
tential Bethe-Salpeter equation approach. With the help of
the SU(3) symmetric Lagrangian, not only the Weinberg-
Tomozawa term but also the one-boson exchange are consid-
ered to describe the K ¯K∗ interaction.

With quantum number IG(JPC) = 0+(1++), a pole is found
with reasonable cutoﬀ, which can be related to the f (1285) in
experiment. Another two molecular bound states with 0−(1+−)
and 1−(1++) are also produced from the K ¯K∗ interaction. Fur-
ther theoretical and experimental studies are helpful to clear
the relation between these two poles and experimentally ob-
served h1(1380) and a1(1420).

With the results in the current work, one can ﬁnd that the
Weinberg-Tomozawa term is more important than the one-
boson exchange. However, the one-boson exchange also plays
an important role in the K ¯K∗ interaction, so is non-negligible.
Besides, the results in the current work also indict that the
Weinberg-Tomozawa term can not be reduced from the vector
meson exchange in the case considered in this work.

In the case with quantum number IG(JPC) = 0+(1++),
which is related to the f1(1285), the poles can be found in
full model, model with one-boson exchange only (OBE) and
model with Weinberg-Tomozawa term (WT) only. The poles
run to the threshold with decrease of the cutoﬀ Λ and become
resonances after crossing the threshold, which will die away
