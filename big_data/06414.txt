ABSTRACT

We study the worldsheet S-matrix of a string attached to a D-brane in AdS5×S5. The
D-brane is either a giant graviton or a dual giant graviton. In the gauge theory, the operators
we consider belong to the su(2|3) sector of the theory. Magnon excitations of open strings
can exhibit both elastic (when magnons in the bulk of the string scatter) and inelastic (when
magnons at the endpoint of an open string participate) scattering. Both of these S-matrices
are determined (up to an overall phase) by the su(2|2)2 global symmetry of the theory. In
this note we study the S-matrix for inelastic scattering. We show that it exhibits poles
correponding to boundstates of bulk and boundary magnons. A crossing equation is derived
for the overall phase. It reproduces the crossing equation for maximal giant gravitons, in the
appropriate limit. Finally, scattering in the su(2) sector is computed to two loops. This two
loop result, which determines the overall phase to two loops, will be useful when a unique
solution to the crossing equation is to be selected.

’t Hoofts original proposal that the large N expansion of Yang-Mills theories are equivalent to
a string theory[1] is realized beautifully in the AdS/CFT correspondence[2]. Many concrete
details of the duality can be conﬁrmed with precision checks, thanks to integrability of planar
N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory[3, 4]: the planar diagrams give rise to a two dimensional
eﬀective theory which can be matched, in exquisite detail, to the worldsheet theory of a
string. This detailed matching is possible because integrability allows the exact λ = g2
Y M N
dependence of certain quantities to be computed.

There are many interesting string theory questions whose answer require the study of
certain large N but non-planar limits of Yang-Mills theory. One such example is the study
of the open string excitations of giant graviton branes. The physics of this problem requires
summing many non-planar diagrams in the Yang-Mills theory, and so, corresponds to non-
perturbative string eﬀects[5]. Further, since the system is not in general integrable[6], a
detailed comparison akin to what was achieved in the planar limit seems impossible. How-
ever, if one restricts to the su(2|3) sector of the theory it turns out that the exact S matrix
describing the scattering of worldsheet excitations can still be determined up to an overall
phase, by making use of the global su(2|2)2 symmetry enjoyed by this sector[7, 8]. The
scattering of magnon excitations of open strings is inelastic[6], which is a strong hint that
the system is not integrable.

The fact that some quantities can be computed exactly, even without integrability, is
extremely interesting and deserves to be explored in detail. The ﬁrst goal of this study is to
explore the structure of the S-matrix for inelastic magnon scattering and verify that it has
the stucture we expect. Speciﬁcally, the analyticity and unitarity of the S-matrix implies a
correspondence between singularities of the S-matrix and on-shell intermediate states. This
is the subject of section 2. We ﬁnd a pole corresponding to binding a bulk and a boundary
magnon. The structure of boundstates that we uncover smoothly interpolates between the
bound state structure of bulk magnons[15, 16] (for small giant gravitons when r ≈ 1) and
the bound state structure obtained for maximal giants[11] (when r ≈ 0). The boundstate is

1

a BPS state in the double box representation of su(2|2)2. The second goal of this work is to
study the overall phase of the S-matrix. This phase is constrained by a crossing symmetry
equation[12, 13]. Using insights following from similar studies of the same question in the
planar limit [8, 11], we write down an equation obeyed by this phase, by considering the
scattering of a magnon with a singlet state. Although we have not managed to solve this
equation, we have checked that it reduces the crossing equation[11] obtained for maximal
giant gravitons in an appropriate limit. Finally, we study scattering in the su(2) sector,
perturbatively to two loops, in the super Yang-Mills theory. These results can be used to
single out a unique solution to the crossing equation.

2 Bound State Spectrum

The scattering problem is most conveniently described using complex spectral parameters
x±. In terms of these parameters, the charge, energy and momentum of a magnon can be
written as follows[6]

n =

g

i (cid:18)x+ +

1
x+ − rx− −

r

x−(cid:19)

E =

i (cid:18)x+ −

(2.1)

(2.2)

where r = 1 for a bulk magnon, 0 ≤ r < 1 for a boundary magnon attached to a giant
graviton and r > 1 for a boundary magnon attached to a dual giant graviton. Using the above
relations we can determine the energy of a magnon in terms of its charge and momentum as

E = pn2 + 4g2(1 + r2) − 8g2r cos(p)

(2.3)

x+ − r

The condition that x+ − rx− and 1
x− are pure imaginary will ensure real charges,
energies, and momenta. To look for boundstates we will analyticaly continue the spectral
parameters by relaxing this condition, allowing the energy and momenta to be complex. We
will however maintain (2.1): this is the condition to have a short (atypical) representation of
su(2|2)2. It is only for these representations that the tensor product of two representations
is irreducible and hence that the su(2|2)2 symmetry is suﬃcient to ﬁx the S-matrix up to
an overall phase. The inverse relation is

x± =

ie±i p
2g(ei p

2 (E + n)
2 − re−i p
2 )

(2.4)

The scattering of a bulk and a boundary magnon is inelastic, as we now explain. We use
a subscript 1 to denote the bulk magnon before scattering and a subscript 2 to denote

2

a boundary magnon before scattering. We used primed subscripts for the magnons after
scattering. The momenta, energies and charges after scattering are determined by solving

E1 + E2 = E′

1 + E′
2

p1 + p2 = p′

1 + p′
2

n1 + n2 = n′

1 + n′
2

(2.5)

These equations can be reduced to the solution of a cubic equation that has a single real
root, but the details are not very illuminating. Close to r = 0 and r = 1 we can do better
though: at r = 1 − ǫ we have

1 = x±

2 = x±

1 ∼ O(ǫ), δx′±

Working to order ǫ we ﬁnd a set of linear equations whose explicit solution shows that
δx′±
2 ∼ O(ǫ) for both cases. The linear equations we use arise by assuming
we scatter elementary magnons (so that n1 = n2 = n′
2 = 1), as well as energy and
momentum conservation. The fact that δx′±
2 are non-zero is a clear indication that the
scattering is not elastic.

We now focus attention on the scattering of magnons that belong to the su(2) sector
of the theory. This is still perfectly general since the global symmetry of the theory then
determines scattering in any other sector[7].
In this case, up to an undetermined overall
phase, the S-matrix is given by1

This reduces to the correct bulk[7] and reﬂection[11] matrices when we set r = 1 and r = 0
respectively2. The statement that the S-matrix is unitary is the statement

1′2′ = 1

(2.10)

which we have veriﬁed holds for any r, as it should.

We will now look for singularities in the S-matrix. The presence of simple poles indicate
on shell intermeddiate states. Investigations of the singularities of the elastic magnon S-
matrix has uncovered a wealth of BPS boundstates [15, 16, 17]. We will argue below that

1Here, following [6], we use the notation R to denote the S-matrix for the scattering of a bulk and a

boundary magnon. We reserve S for the S-matrix of bulk magnon scattering, which is an elastic process.

2To make this comparison we found [14] very useful.

we ﬁnd an equally rich spectrum of BPS boundstates that naturally interpolate between
the boundstates of bulk magnons[15] and the boundstates a bulk magnon and a boundary
magnon associated to a maximal giant graviton[11]. Inspection of (2.9) suggests possible
poles when x′+
2 = 0. Since the charges nk are positive integers and since we
want to keep Re(Ek) > 0, its clear from (2.4) that these poles can’t be realized. The factor
1 − x+
in the denominator (x−
1 ) can also give rise to a pole. Analyzing this factor
near r = 1 we ﬁnd a pole at

To interpret this pole recall that singularities of the S-matrix correspond to spacetime dia-
grams where each particle is on-shell[18]. Particle worldlines meet at vertices which conserve
charge, energy and momentum. We want to consider a cubic vertex corresponding to the
creation of a boundstate from a boundary and a bulk magnon. Using b′ to denote the bound-
state of a boundary and a bulk magnon, the conservation of charge, energy and momentum
implies that

b′ )

(2.14)

Since this is three equations we can completely determine the spectral parameters of the
boundstate using two of the above equations. The third equation then implies a relation
between the magnon and boundary magnon spectral relations that is obeyed by (2.13). It
is straight forward to apply the rules described in [17] and verify that this pole signals a
normalizable wave function, for a boundstate with charge n = 2 and energy given by (2.3)
evaluated at this n. Further, when r = 1 (2.13) is the pole identiﬁed in [15] as a signal of a
bound state of bulk magnons and when r = 0 (2.13) is the pole identiﬁed in [11] as the signal

4

of a bound state of a bulk and a boundary magnon, for the case of open string attached to
a maximal giant graviton.

We can now continue and consider the scattering of a bulk magnon with this boundate,
producing a new boundstate with charge n = 3.
Indeed, following the rules of [17], we
ﬁnd a family of boundstate with one boundary magnon bound to n − 1 bulk magnons.
This boundstate has a charge of n and energy given by (2.3). By varying r smoothly
from r = 0 to r = 1, this structure of boundstates nicely interpolates from the known
structure of boundstates when bulk magnons bind to the boundary magnon of a maximal
giant graviton[11] and the known structure for bulk magnons boundstates[15].

3 Crossing Equation

To derive the crossing equation, we will follow the derivation given in [8]. The same method
has been applied to determine the crossing equation for maximal giant gravitons in [11]. The
idea is to consider the scattering from the singlet state

¯pφ2
|I¯p,pi = fp(cid:0)|φ1

pi − |φ2

¯pψ2
pi(cid:1) + |ψ1
¯pφ1

pi − |ψ2

¯pψ1
pi

(3.1)

The phase factor fp is determined by requiring that the singlet state is annihilated by all of
the su(2|2) elements, as explained in [8]. To obtain the crossing equation, we consider the
scattering of this impurity from the right boundary magnon. The only diﬀerence we ﬁnd as
compared to [11], is that the scattering is inelsatic. Since the scattering is inelastic, we ﬁnd

R(¯p, q′)S(¯p, p′)R(p, q)|I¯p,p, qi = φr|Ip′,¯p′, qi

(3.2)

r. The crossing equation is now obtained by requiring that φ2

where r is a phase. If we now scatter the singlet from the left boundary magnon, explicit
computation show that we pick up the same phase, so that we return to the original state
apart from the phase φ2
r is one,
i.e. that φr = ±1. To choose the correct sign, we compare to the r = 0 limit (studied in [11])
and conclude that we should impose φr = 1. Since this crossing equation involves both the
scattering of bulk with bulk magnons and the scattering of boundary with bulk magnons, it
relates the overall phase factor of S (which has been determined) to the overall phase factor
of R (what we want to determine). After a tedious computation we ﬁnd the following result

(cid:0)fpC R(p, q)GS(¯p, p′) − 2LR(p, q)K S(¯p, p′))(H R(¯p, q′)K R(¯p, q′) − GR(p, q′)LR(¯p, q′)(cid:1)

2LR(¯p, q′)

= 1

(3.3)

where the matrix elements of R (denoted with superscript R) are derived in [6] and the
matrix elements of S (denoted with superscript S) are derived in [8]. We will refer to the
function on the LHS of (3.3) as the crossing function. Scattering with diﬀerent boundary
magnon states determines crossing functions that have a diﬀerent expression in terms of the

5

matrix elements of R and S, but lead to the same crossing equation. We have not written
this crossing equation in terms of the spectral parameters of the initial and ﬁnal magnons
as these expressions are rather long. The phase we have discussed above arises from an
su(2|2) factor. The theory actually enjoys su(2|2)2 symmetry, so the full reﬂection factor is
the square of the phase factor we discussed above.

As a ﬁrst check of these results, we note that when r = 0 they reproduce the crossing
equation quoted in equation (41) of [19].
In addition to this, a numerical study of the
crossing equation reveals an appealing symmetry. Recall that we denote the boundary
magnon momentum by q and the bulk magnon momentum by p. The crossing equation
obtained from scattering oﬀ the right boundary with momenta p + q → p′ + q′ is identical
to crossing equation obtained the left scattering with the same momenta q + p → q′ + p′. If
one considers right scattering with momenta p′ + q′ → p + q or left scattering with momenta
q′ + p′ → q + p the crossing equations are again identical: for all four situations we obtain the
same crossing equation. The appearance of this symmetry is important for the consistency
of our derivation of the crossing equation since it ensures that scattering the singlet from
both boundaries as described above, does indeed return us to our initial state. It is satisfying
that this derivation of the crossing equation works even though we have inelastic scattering.

4

su(2) Scattering to Two Loops

We will now consider the scattering of a bulk and a boundary magnon, at two loops, in
the super Yang-Mills theory. This will allow us to determine the overall phase of R to two
loops, which will be useful data when a unique solution to the crossing equation is to be
singled out. The operators in the Yang-Mills theory dual to giant gravitons are given by
Schur polynomials [20, 21, 22]. Giant gravitons with open string excitations are dual to the
restricted Schur polynomials, constructed in [23, 24]. The action of the dilatation operator
on the restricted Schur polynomials has been constructed in [25, 26, 6].
In what follows
below we use this action at two loops to deﬁne the Hamiltonian for a Schr¨odinger equation
based description of the magnon scattering. The Bethe ansatz for the wave function is given
by[27]

ψ(l1, l2) = eip1l1+ip2l2 + Aeip′

1l1+ip′

2l2 + g2φ(l1)δ|l1−l2|,1

(4.1)

where if |l1 − l2| > 2 the wave function must obey the Schr¨odinger equation

EΨ(l1, l2) = g2(3 + r2)Ψ(l1, l2) − g2r (Ψ(l1 − 1, l2) + Ψ(l1 + 1, l2))

−g2 (Ψ(l1, l2 − 1) + Ψ(l1, l2 + 1)) + g4(cid:16)(cid:0)1 + r2(cid:1)2 + 4(cid:17) Ψ(l1, l2)
−2g4(cid:0)1 + r2(cid:1) r (Ψ(l1 − 1, l2) + Ψ(l1 + 1, l2))
−4g4 (Ψ(l1, l2 − 1) + Ψ(l1, l2 + 1))
+g4r2 (Ψ(l1 − 2, l2) + 2Ψ(l1, l2) + Ψ(l1 + 2, l2))

+g4 (Ψ(l1, l2 − 2) + 2Ψ(l1, l2) + Ψ(l1, l2 + 2)) ,

(4.2)

l1 is the position of the boundary magnon, with momentum p1. l2 is the position of the bulk
magnon, with momentum p2. If l2 = l1 + 2, the Schr¨odinger equation becomes

EΨ(l1, l1 + 2) = g2(3 + r2)Ψ(l1, l1 + 2) − g2r (Ψ(l1 − 1, l1 + 2) + Ψ(l1 + 1, l1 + 2))

−g2 (Ψ(l1, l1 + 1) + Ψ(l1, l1 + 3)) + g4(cid:16)(cid:0)1 + r2(cid:1)2 + 4(cid:17) Ψ(l1, l1 + 2)

+g4r2 (Ψ(l1 − 2, l1 + 2) + 2Ψ(l1, l1 + 2)) ,

(4.3)

and if l2 = l1 + 1, the Schr¨odinger equation becomes

E Ψ(l1, l1 + 1) = g2(1 + r2)Ψ(l1, l1 + 1) − g2rΨ(l1 − 1, l1 + 1) − g2Ψ(l1, l1 + 2)

+g4(cid:0)r4 + 1(cid:1) Ψ(l1, l1 + 1) − 2g4(cid:0)1 + r2(cid:1) rΨ(l1 − 1, l1 + 1) − 4g4Ψ(l1, l1 + 2)
+g4r2 (Ψ(l1 − 2, l1 + 1) + Ψ(l1, l1 + 1)) + g4 (Ψ(l1, l1 + 1) + Ψ(l1, l1 + 3))
+g4r (Ψ(l1 − 1, l1) + Ψ(l1 + 1, l1 + 2)) ,

(4.4)

From (4.2) we learn that

E = g2(3 + r2) − g2r(e−ip1 + eip1) − g2(e−ip2 + eip2) + g4(1 + r2)2 + 4g4
−2g4(1 + r2)r(e−ip1 + eip1) − 4g4(e−ip2 + eip2) + g4(e−2ip2 + 2 + e2ip2)
g4r2(e−2ip1 + 2 + e2ip1)

(4.5)

From (4.3) we ﬁnd

rφ(l1 + 1) + φ(l1) = −r2ψ(l1 + 2, l1 + 2) − ψ(l1, l1) + 2ψ(l1, l1 + 2)

(4.6)

Finally, from (4.4) we ﬁnd

g4(2 − r(e−ip1 + eip1) − eip2 − e−ip2)φ(l1)
= −2g2ψ(l1, l1 + 1) + g2rψ(l1 + 1, l1 + 1) + g2ψ(l1, l1) − g4(4 + 2r2)ψ(l1, l1 + 1)
+2g4(1 + r2)rψ(l1 + 1, l1 + 1) + 4g4ψ(l1, l1) − g4r2(ψ(l1, l1 + 1) + ψ(l1 + 2, l1 + 1))
−g4(ψ(l1, l1 − 1) + ψ(l1, l1 + 1)) + g4r(ψ(l1 − 1, l1) + ψ(l1 + 1, l1 + 2))

(4.7)

Starting from (4.7) we are able to solve for φ(l1). We ﬁnd that φ(l1) is independent of l1
which is intuitively appealing. Inserting the solution for φ(l1) into (4.6), we are able to solve
for A. The result is
