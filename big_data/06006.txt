POLYNOMIAL TIME RELATIVELY COMPUTABLE TRIANGULAR

ARRAYS IN A MULTINOMIAL SETTING

†
VLADIMIR DOBRI ´C

, PATRICIA GARMIRIAN, AND LEE J. STANLEY

Abstract. We extend the methods and results of [3] to the setting of multinomial distribu-
tions satisfying certain properties. These include all the multinomial distributions arising from
the direct proof of the Central Limit Theorem given in [2], which, by results of that paper,
constitutes essentially full generality for the situations in which the Central Limit Theorem
holds.

1. Introduction

The two papers, [2] and [3], provide the context for our work here. The ﬁrst of these papers
provides a direct proof of the Central Limit Theorem that proceeds by introducing a sequence
of approximating multinomial distributions. The second deals more narrowly with the sequence
{Sn} based on Rademacher random variables, so that the basic setting is that of the binomial
distributions with p = 1
2. It focuses on the notion of strong, trim triangular array representations
of the sequence of quantiles of the sequence {Sn} in this restricted setting, classifying them
by sequences of admissible permutations and analyzing the complexity of the simplest of these
classifying sequences.

We extend the methods and many (but not all) of the results of the latter to the setting of
multinomial distributions provided by the former. These multinomial distributions essentially
capture (via suﬃciently good approximation) the full generality of situations where the Central
Limit Theorem holds: this is one of the main results of [2]. Thus, the results of this paper
represent signiﬁcant progress on the program laid out in the ﬁrst paragraph of [3]: obtaining
(and analyzing the complexity of) strong trim triangular representations for the sequences of
quantiles of weakly convergent sequences.
We will say more, below, about the connections and diﬀerences between this paper, and the
papers [2] and [3], but both of these end up working closely with a sequence, (Rn|n ∈ Z+),
Rn. The main concern
of i.i.d.

random variables deﬁned on (0, 1); both consider Sn :=

n,i|n ∈ Z+ and 1 ≤ i ≤ n(cid:1) of the sequence, (S∗

of [3] was, for a very speciﬁc choice of Rn, to provide strong trim triangular array represen-
n|n ∈ Z+) of quantiles of the sequence
(Sn|n ∈ Z+), and to analyze the complexity of the simplest of these representations. We carry
out this program here, starting from the more complicated and general sequences (Rn|n ∈ Z+)
whose partial sums, Sn, are the multinomial distributions of [2].

The ﬁrst main result of [3] was (for each n) to classify by admissible permutations of {0, . . . , 2n − 1}

n,i|1 ≤ i ≤ n(cid:1) that sum to S∗

of (1.1); for now, it will suﬃce to say that the representations we obtain in this paper will be
“trim” in a sense that is the clear analogue of the trimness notion of [3].

n and satisfy the “trimness” condition along
with some additional properties. The analogue of this result is Theorem 1 of this paper, proved

all of the sequences(cid:0)R∗
in (2.2). Now the classifying permutations are permutations of(cid:8)0, . . . , 2n(M +1) − 1(cid:9), where M is
permutations classify strong trim triangular array representations(cid:0)R∗
n,i|n ∈ Z+ and 1 ≤ i ≤ n(cid:1)
there are “many” admissible permutations of(cid:8)0, . . . , 2n(M +1) − 1(cid:9). This is item (3) of Lemma 1,

a parameter associated with one of the multinomial distributions arising from the setting of [2],
and admissibility is deﬁned in an analogous fashion appropriate to the multinomial distribution
under consideration. An immediate consequence is that sequences, (πn|n ∈ Z+), of admissible
of (S∗

n|n ∈ Z+); this is Corollary 1, also (2.2).
As was the case in [3], analysis of the admissibility condition leads readily to the conclusion that

proved in (3.1). Combining Theorem 1, Corollary 1 and Lemma 1 immediately gives Corollary 2,
also in (3.1): the existence of (continuum many) strong trim triangular array representations of
n|n ∈ Z+). The second main result of [3] was the polynomial time computability of the sequence
(S∗
(Fn|n ∈ Z+), of admissible permutations in which each Fn is, in a suitable sense, the simplest
possible permutation of {0, . . . , 2n − 1}; by extension, the corresponding strong trim triangular
array representation is also polynomial time computable. Here too, we obtain the analogous
results: these are Theorems 2, 3 in (3.2). It would be too much to hope for polynomial time
computability outright, because of the dependence on the random variable O. Instead we will
1 , introduced in Deﬁnition 4
have polynomial time computability relative to a certain function τ O
in (3.1). This function encodes, in a very natural way, information about how level n multinomial
vectors map to the values of Sn. We give a more detailed summary of the route to Theorems 2
and 3 at the beginning of §3.
1.1. Preliminaries, Notation, Conventions. Throughout this paper we work in the ﬁxed
probability space consisting of the open real unit interval (0, 1) equipped with Lebesgue measure.
For x ∈ (0, 1), write:

∞(cid:88)

i=1

x =

εi(x)2−i, with each εi(x) ∈ {0, 1} and εi(x) = 0 for inﬁnitely many i.

We work relative to a ﬁxed random variable, O, with domain (0, 1).

In (1.2.1), below, we
discuss the results of [2], which provide the context giving rise to O and its properties. For now,
we lay out these properties as assumptions.

Associated with O is a ﬁxed non-negative integer, M. We assume that:

for x ∈ (0, 1), O(x) depends bijectively on (ε1(x) . . . εM +1(x)) .

Thus, O takes on m = 2M +1 outcomes, which we enumerate in increasing order as o1, . . . , om.
We make the further assumptions that these outcomes are equally likely, that their sum is 0 and
that the sum of their squares is 1. All of this will follow from the account, in (1.2.1), of the results
of [2]; the displayed equation for OM that occurs there is particularly relevant. Taken together,
the increasing enumeration of the os and the bijection between them and the (ε1(x) . . . εM +1(x))
provide us with a ﬁxed enumeration, (ςs|1 ≤ s ≤ m) of {0, 1}M +1:

ςs is such that O(x) = os for all x such that (ε1(x) . . . εM +1(x)) = ςs.

if and only if Y depends only on (cid:0)ε1(y), . . . , εn(M +1)(y)(cid:1). Thus, our assumption is that O is

The “trimness” condition of this paper is that a random variable, Y , deﬁned on (0, 1) is n-trim

1-trim.
One of the main devices of [2] is to create an i.i.d family of “copies”, Ri, of O, for posi-
tive integers, i. This is accomplished by taking Ri(x) to be O(Pi(x)), where, for each x ∈
(0, 1), (Pi(x)|i ∈ Z+) is a (uniformly deﬁned) system of copies of x. At a very high level, the Pi
can be deﬁned by creating a pairwise disjoint family (Ji|i ∈ Z+) of inﬁnite subsets of Z+, and
then “taking Pi(x) to be the projection of x onto the set of coordinates Ji.” If x were in Cantor

2

space rather than in (0, 1), this would be completely accurate; we will make it precise in the
next paragraph. First, however, we note that while it is natural to think that the Ji should form
a partition of Z+, in our implementation, this will not be the case, and this will oﬀer deﬁnite
advantages.

For each positive integer, i, let (ji,k|k ∈ Z+) be the increasing enumeration of Ji and let:

J i := {ji,1, . . . , ji,M +1} and J

n

:= J 1 ∪ . . . ∪ J n.

We then take Pi(x) to be that member of (0, 1), satisfying:

for all k, εk (Pi(x)) = εji,k (x).

In [2], Ji is chosen to be “the ith column of a triangular array of positive integers” (not to be
confused with the triangular arrays of random variables which are the main objects of study in
this paper) in which the “rows” do partition Z+, where each row is a ﬁnite set of consecutive
integers, and where the sequence of row lengths, ((cid:96)gρ|ρ ∈ Z+), is monotone non-decreasing and
unbounded. Note that with the stipulation that the rows form a partition into ﬁnite sets of
consecutive integers, the triangular array of positive integers is completely speciﬁed by specifying
the sequence of row lengths ((cid:96)gρ|ρ ∈ Z+).
Dobri´c and Garmirian adopt a speciﬁc choice of ((cid:96)gρ|ρ ∈ Z+) but note that, for the results
of [2], any reasonable choice suﬃces. For the purposes of this paper, and, in particular, for the
proof of Lemma 2, we make an apparently somewhat odd speciﬁc choice of ((cid:96)gρ|ρ ∈ Z+). For
positive integers, ρ, we let:

(cid:96)gρ be the unique positive integer b such that (b − 1)(M + 1) < ρ ≤ b(M + 1).

Thus, the rows come in “blocks” of size (M + 1); for rows in the bth block, the row length is b.
We also decompose a row index, ρ, as:

((cid:96)g(ρ) − 1)(M + 1) + r(ρ), with 1 ≤ r ≤ M + 1.

Thus, (cid:96)g(ρ) is the block index of ρ while r(ρ) is the index of ρ within its block.

Via the Ri, for all positive integers, n, O determines a multinomial distribution, MNO
n
with domain (0, 1). The values, MNO(x), of the multinomial distributions are the inner prod-
ucts, k1(x)o1 + . . . + km(x)om, where the ks(x) are the frequencies with which os occurs in
(R1(x), . . . , Rn(x)). Thus, the ks(x) are non-negative integers that sum to n and so there are

(cid:1) vectors (k1(x), . . . , km(x)) and at most this many values of MNO

exactly(cid:0)n+m−1

With all of this in place, we now“zoom in a bit more closely on” our main objects of study.

each Ri depends only on the j ∈ J i and so each Sn depends only on the j ∈ J

As in [3], we are also interested in the quantiles, S∗

n, of Sn. The signiﬁcance of the quantiles
comes, in large measure, from the work of Skorokhod. He showed, [5], that if {Xn} is a sequence
of random variables (on any probability space) converging weakly to X, then the sequence of
quantiles, X∗
n (which are deﬁned on (0, 1), regardless of the domain of the original Xn), converges
almost surely to X∗, the quantile of X (also deﬁned on (0, 1)).

n:

IS∗

n((cid:96)) = the constant value of S∗

n on Dn,(cid:96), for 0 ≤ (cid:96) < 2n(M +1).

As in [3], this serves as a paradigm case for introducing integer versions of notions (usually
functions, but sometimes relations) naturally deﬁned on (0, 1), when the notion is invariant on
a system of subsets of (0, 1), indexed by integers. The indexing will typically also depend on
n as a parameter, and the subsets in question will typically be either the Dn,(cid:96) or the En,(cid:96) (the
analogues, for Sn, of the Dn,(cid:96) which we introduce in (2.1.2), below).

Our approach to complexity issues will follow that of [3], especially as laid out in the ﬁnal two
paragraphs of subsection (1.2) of that paper. We also include the references [1], [4] from that
paper for general background on computational complexity.

1.2. Connections with [2] and [3]. In this subsection we elaborate further on the connections
between this paper and the work of [2] (in (1.2.1)) and that of [3] (in (1.2.2)).

1.2.1. The Context Provided by the Results of [2]. In [2], Dobrić and Garmirian give an explicit
proof of the CLT directly from the deﬁnition of weak convergence, which states that (with S a
Polish space equipped with the σ − algebra B(S) of Borel subsets of S) a sequence of measures
µn (on S) converges to µ weakly provided that for each bounded, continuous function f : S → R,

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

lim
n→∞

f (x) dµn(x) =

f (x) dµ(x).

In the setting of [2], S is R and {µn} is the sequence of measures induced by a speciﬁed i.i.d.
sequence of random variables.

The starting point in [2] is not the random variable O of (1.1), but a much more general
random variable, Q, on which the only assumptions are that Q has mean 0 and variance 1. The
random variable O of (1.1) will be obtained as a “truncated version” of the expansion of Q with
respect to the Haar basis. Such an expansion is available since Q ∈ L2(0, 1).
Using that paper’s verions of the sort of Pi described in (1.1), an i.i.d. sequence (Qi|i ∈ Z+)
of copies of Q is obtained by taking Qi(x) to be Q (Pi(x)). Expanding Q, respectively the Qi,
with respect to the Haar basis yields:

Qi(x) =

The next step in [2] is to consider the following sums of n i.i.d. random variables:

Σn(x) :=

Qi(x).

In [2], these Σn were denoted by Sn. The following truncated versions of Q, the Qi and Σn were
also considered in [2]; the last was denoted there by Sn,M. For M ∈ N, deﬁne:

It follows from properties of the outcomes that OM will also have mean 0 and that

Thus, they showed that these Haar expansions are in fact “suﬃciently close” to their truncated
versions. They then further approximated these truncated versions by the standard Gaussian
measure on R, completing their proof of the CLT.

It is then clear that for each i, each M and for all x:

for all x, Σn,M (x) depends only on (cid:0)εji,k (x)|1 ≤ k ≤ M + 1, 1 ≤ i ≤ n(cid:1) .

The context for this paper is then provided by ﬁxing a suitable M, letting O be OM, and
(referring back to Equation (1)) letting Ri = O ◦ Pi = Ri,M and Sn be Σn,M, but with the
speciﬁc choice of the Pi described in (1.1).
1.2.2. The Special Case of
[3]: M = 0. Here, we indicate how the work of [3] can and should
be understood as the analysis of the special case M = 0, and also discuss similarities and some
diﬀerences in the approach taken in this paper. The [3] analogue of the random variable O should
be one of two Rademacher random variables deﬁned on (0, 1), taking on values -1 and 1, each
with probability 1/2, and depending only on ε1. This brings us to a minor discordance between
the treatment in [3] and that of [2]: in [3], implicitly, O(x) is taken to be (−1)1+ε1(x), so that
the natural order on (0, 1) coincides with the lexicographic order on {−1, 1}Z+, whereas the true
analogue of the treatment in [2] would take O(x) to be (−1)ε1(x). Here, we have opted for the
latter choice, so that the analogy with [3] is imperfect in this minor respect. The role of O in [3]
is left in the background, however, mainly because the notions developed above depend so much
more transparently on x in the setting of that paper. This will be a recurring theme, and we
shall comment on its inﬂuence in various places in what follows.

Continuing with the system of analogies, the [3] analogue of the triangular array of integers is
simply the diagonal: each “row” has length 1 and i is the unique entry in the ith row. Thus, (in
view of the observations in the previous paragraph) the [3] analogue of Ri is Ri(x) = (−1)1+εi(x).
The analogue of Pi is denoted by Xi in [3], and Xi(x) is simply εi(x). In [3], the Ri are simply
taken to be given, as in the previous sentence, rather than “created” as copies of O via the various
Pi.

5

In view of the preceding, note that the [3] analogue of J i is simply {i}. One motivation for the
choice we have made, above, of the triangular array of integers, is to try to recapture as much as
possible of the simplicity of this situation; our J i also are not only pairwise disjoint, but come
in consecutive blocks:
if i1 < i2 then all members of J i1 are less than all members of J i2. In
fact, specifying this property along with the speciﬁcation that the cardinality of each J i is M + 1
almost completely determines the choice of the Pi, we have made in this paper and described
in (1.1), in that it requires that each row length is repeated at least, but not necessarily exactly
M + 1 times. After the proof of Lemma 2, in (3.2), we will indicate exactly how this faciilitates
the proof of this Lemma.

they are of depth n(M + 1), the Dn,(cid:96) introduced in the penultimate paragraph of (1.1). This

2−n(M +1). This, in turn, follows from the fact that S∗
2.1.2. Level Sets for Sn. Here, as a result of the multinomial distribution and the related “shuﬄe”
involved in the deﬁnition of the Pi(x), the situation is rather diﬀerent. The level sets for Sn will
not be unions of depth n(M + 1) dyadic intervals; greater depth is necessarily involved once we
leave behind the simple M = 0 case of [3]. The correct picture emerges from a more detailed
analysis which we now undertake.
Recall the Ji from (1.1) and that their increasing enumerations are the (ji,k|k ∈ Z+). Recall
n. Also, as noted in Equations (2) and (3), above, the sequence

together,(cid:0)εji,k (x)|1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ M(cid:1) completely determines the sequence (Ri(x)|1 ≤ i ≤ n),
and therefore determines Sn(x), the sum of this sequence. Let (cid:0)(cid:126)e(cid:96)|0 ≤ (cid:96) < 2n(M +1)(cid:1) be the

Then, each En,(cid:96) has measure 2−n(M +1) and the level sets of Sn are unions of these En,(cid:96).
2.1.3. Sequences of binary digits and outcomes. For x ∈ (0, 1), we set:

(cid:126)bn(x) :=(cid:0)ε1(x), . . . , εn(M +1)(x)(cid:1) ,

(cid:126)on(x) := (R1(x), . . . , Rn(x)) .

For 1 ≤ (cid:96) ≤ n, (cid:126)bn(x) is constant on Dn,(cid:96) and (cid:126)on(x) is constant on En,(cid:96). Therefore, following
the convention in the ﬁnal paragraph of (1.1), we denote these constant values by I(cid:126)bn((cid:96)), I(cid:126)on((cid:96)),
respectively. Of course, the same also applies to each individual Ri and so we also denote by
(IRi)n ((cid:96)) the constant value of Ri(x) on En,(cid:96). As in [3], I(cid:126)bn((cid:96)) is the reverse of the binary
representation of (cid:96):

3. Theorems 2 and 3

We follow the general outline of §3 of [3], omitting certain items, and in particular, those
speciﬁcally targetted at §4 of [3], as well as Propositions 1 - 3 of that paper. As part of our
concluding remarks in (3.3), we will discuss in more detail the status of the omitted items.

In (3.1.1), we introduce a number of notions related to the correspondence between values of
n and multinomial vectors (cid:126)k; the latter arise as vectors (of length m) of frequencies of
the MNO
2 . This is the substance of
the outcomes, os of O. We also introduce the functions τ O
1 is essential and has been mentioned in the Introduction, just
Deﬁnitions 2 - 5. The role of τ O
prior to the beginning of (1.1). On the other hand, despite its formal dependence on O, the
role of the function τ O
2 is merely a convenience for the proof of the important Lemma 2. This is
discussed in somewhat more detail below.

1 and τ O

In (3.1.2), Deﬁnition 6 introduces the function SMCO and the γO

n,t, which are this paper’s
analogues of the function SBC of [3] and the binomial coeﬃcients, respectively. In Deﬁnition

8

7, we introduce this paper’s versions of the functions Stepn, Weightn. Incorporating Remark 1
paves the way for introducing their “integer versions” IStepn, IWeightn, IS and IS∗, respectively,
following the paradigm laid out in the penultimate paragraph of (1.1). We also introduce the
functions IStep, IWeight which are the natural encodings (as functions of two variables) of the
family of the IStepn, IWeightn, respectively. Some obvious properties of these “integer versions”
are stated in Remark 2.

In Deﬁnition 8, we introduce the sets An,t and Bn,t (this paper’s version of the sets An,i and
Bn,i of [3]), their “integer versions” IAn,t and IBn,t, the three-place relations RIA and RIB, which
encode the families IAn,i and IBn,i respectively, and, ﬁnallly, their cardinality functions, α(n, t, ξ)
and β(n, t, ξ), respectively, and their enumerating functions an,t,s and bn,t,s, respectively. The
cardinality and enumerating functions play an important role in the proofs of Lemma 2 and
Theorem 2. The notion of “tameness” which was introducted in [3], remains in the background
here, but plays an important role implicitly. This will be discussed in connection with the
summary of (3.2).

The material of Deﬁnition 8 also sets the stage for the concluding items, Lemma 1 and Corol-
lary 2, of (3.1.2). In part (a) of Lemma 1, we show that, in analogy with the situation of [3], the
n,t are the common cardinalities, αn,t of IAn,t and βn,t of IBn,t. In part (b), we give an alternate
γO
characterization of admissibility which enables part (c), where we ﬁnally tie up some loose ends

from §2 by proving the existence of many admissible permutations of (cid:8)0, . . . , 2n(M +1) − 1(cid:9). In

Corollary 2, we invoke Theorem 1 and Corollary 1 to extend this to the existence of representa-
tions (with the needed properties) of each S∗
n and to strong, trim triangular array representations
n}. We conclude (3.1) by developing, in (3.1.3), some notation related to the
of the sequence {S∗
J i. This will be used in the proof of Lemma 2.
We begin to address complexity issues in earnest in (3.2). In Deﬁnition 9 ((3.2.1)), we introduce
the sequence {Fn} of admissible permutations and note, in Remark 3, its connection to the
view of admissibility developed in the ﬁnal paragraph of the proof of Lemma 1. This Remark
justiﬁes the somewhat imprecise claim that each Fn is the simplest admissible permutation of

(cid:8)0, . . . , 2n(M +1) − 1(cid:9).

In (3.2.2) we prove a sequence of results that culminates in the proof of Theorem 2: that
the two-place function F which naturally encodes the sequence {Fn} is P-TIME relative to τ O
1 .
Before laying out in detail the route to this result, it will be helpful to comment brieﬂy on the
role of “tameness” and some of the related results of [3]. The context is that we are dealing with
a d + 1 − place relation, R on N and R has the property that for all (cid:126)u = (u1, . . . , ud) ∈ Nd,

R[(cid:126)u] = {w|R (u1, . . . , ud, w)} is ﬁnite.

The cardinality function for R was then deﬁned to be the function, which, to d+1−tuples, ((cid:126)u, ξ) ∈
Nd+1, assigns the cardinality of R[(cid:126)u] ∩ {1, . . . , ξ}. Then, in [3], such a relation, R, was deﬁned
to be “tame” iﬀ its cardinality function is P-TIME. The important contribution of tameness was
provided by item (6) of Remark 3, and by Lemma 2 of [3], and both of these required a mild
additional assumption: that it is P-TIME decidable whether, given (cid:126)u ∈ Nd, there is some w such
that R((cid:126)u, w). Given this additional assumption on R, item (6) of Remark 3 of [3] notes that if
R is tame, then R itself is P-TIME decidable. This is simply because, for (cid:126)u ∈ Nd and w ∈ Z+,
letting cd denote the cardinality function for R, R((cid:126)u, w) holds iﬀ cd((cid:126)u, w) = cd((cid:126)u, w − 1) + 1.
The content of Lemma 2 of [3] involves the “enumerating function” for a relation R, as above.
This is the function, E, whose domain consists of d + 1 − tuples. ((cid:126)u, s) such that 1 ≤ s ≤ |R[(cid:126)u|,
and to such a d + 1 − tuple assigns the sth member of R[(cid:126)u] (in the increasing enumeration of
R[(cid:126)u]). The result is that if R is tame, then E is P-TIME.

Returning to the context of this paper, of course the relations we have in mind are RIA and
1 . Then,
1 , both of these relations satisfy the mild additional hypothesis: their domains are
1 . The proofs of item (6) of Remark 3, and of Lemma 2, both of

RIB. We relativize all of the notions in the last two paragraphs to the functoin τ O
relative to τ O
P-TIME decidable relative to τ O
[3] then relativize in a completely straightforward way to τ O
1 .

9

We can now continue with our account of the sequence of results in (3.2.2). We begin with
1 : SMCO,
Proposition 1 which establishes that the following functions are P-TIME relative to τ O
the γO
n,t, the function IStep and the function α of Equation (7c) (Deﬁnition 8). As already noted,
above, α is the “cardinality function” for the relation RIA. Therefore, in virtue of the preceding
discussion, it follows (and this is Remark 4) that RIA is tame relative to τ O
1 , and so it is also
P-TIME decidable relative to τ O
1 . This is part of Corollary 3 which also notes that for the same
reason and since the function an,t,s of Equation of (7di) (Deﬁnition 8) is the enumerating function
for RIA, it follows that, as a function of (n, t, s), an,t,s is P-TIME relative to τ O
1 .

In Proposition 2 we show that τ O

2 is outright P-TIME, despite its formal dependence on O.
The main work is done in Lemma 2, where we show that the function β of Equation (7c) is also
1 . It follows (as above for RIA and the function an,t,s) that RIB is tame
P-TIME relative to τ O
1 , and that the function bn,t,s of
relative to τ O
Equation (7dii) (Deﬁnition 8) is also P-TIME relative to τ O
2 (since it is the enumerating function
of RIB). This is Corollary 4, the analogue “on the B − side” of Corollary 3.

1 and therefore P-TIME decidable relative to τ O

This completes the preparation for the proof of Theorem 2. We conclude (3.2) with the obvious
translation of the result of Theorem 2 into the language of strong trim triangular representations
of the sequence {S∗
n}. This is Theorem 3 and it follows immediately from Theorem 2 and
Corollary 1. We conclude the paper in (3.3) with a retrospective comparison with [3], focusing
on the status of the items of [3] which we have omitted, and the underlying diﬃculties having to
do with the fact that there is no longer a transparent connection between the values of Sn and
the number of 1’s in the binary representation of (cid:96) < 2n(M +1).

3.1. Preliminaries for Theorems 2 and 3. Our ﬁrst task will be to take a closer look at the
multinomial distributions MNO

3.1.1. Multinomial vectors, values and frequencies: the functions τ O

n .

n are the inner products, (cid:126)k·(cid:126)o = k1o1 + . . . + kmom,
As already noted in (1.1), the values of MNO
of the (cid:126)k ∈ Kn with the ﬁxed vector, (o1, . . . , om), of outcomes of O. This leads naturally to the
following equivalence relations, ≡n on the Kn.
Deﬁnition 3. For (cid:126)k, (cid:126)κ ∈ Kn, we set (cid:126)k ≡n (cid:126)κ iﬀ (cid:126)k · (cid:126)o = (cid:126)κ · (cid:126)o.

Thus, it is the equivalence classes of ≡n that correspond bijectively to the values of MNO
n .
The structure of the ≡n depends on O, and therefore, ultimately, on Q (recall (1.2)) and thus we
cannot control this structure aside from the minimal requirements imposed by the hypotheses
that Q has been normalized. In particular, we cannot control the number of values/equivalence

We will also denote elements of the domain of τ O

1 by (n, (cid:126)k, t).

The t − indices of these values will serve as the analogues of the notions of Step and Weight
n are the −n + 2i, for 0 ≤ i ≤ n, while the analogue of

τ O
−n ≤ t ≤ n such that n ≡ t( mod 2)) takes on value 1 iﬀ t = −n + 2i. Thus, it checks whether
or not t is the value of Sn that corresponds to the Hamming weight, k. Our τ O
1 furnishes the
analogous check. As usual, in our setting, the correspondence between patterns of binary digits
and values of Sn is no longer at the surface: it depends on O in an essential way.
Deﬁnition 5. For x ∈ (0, 1), 0 ≤ b ≤ n and 1 ≤ s ≤ m, let kn,s(x, b) := the frequency of os
in (((cid:126)on(x))i |i > b) and let (cid:126)kn(x, b) := (kn,1(x, b), . . . , kn,m(x, b)). Since these are constant on the
En,(cid:96), we have also deﬁned the integer versions, Ikn,s((cid:96), b) and I(cid:126)kn((cid:96), b), for 0 ≤ (cid:96) < 2n(M +1).

In view of the penultimate paragraph of (1.1) and 3. of Remark 1, we can introduce the
notions IStepn((cid:96)), IWeightn((cid:96)) for 0 ≤ (cid:96) < 2n(M +1). We already knew that Sn and S∗
n also
n((cid:96)), ISn((cid:96)) for 0 ≤ (cid:96) < 2n(M +1) were

already introduced at the end of (1.1). Via the usual identiﬁcation, we have also introduced the
n((cid:126)b), ISn((cid:126)o) for (cid:126)b ∈ {0, 1}n(M +1) and (cid:126)o ∈ On. Unlike the situation in [3], here, due to
notions IS∗
the role of O, IWeightn((cid:96)) will typically not be independent of n and purely intrinsic to (cid:96); there is
greater symmetry between Step and Weight in the present context. In what follows, we shall use

(1) IStep(n, 0) = 0 and for 0 < (cid:96) < 2n(M +1), IStep(n, (cid:96)) is the least positive t ≤ Tn such

In view of Remark 2, for ﬁxed n > 0, each An,t is a union of Dn,(cid:96)’s and each Bn,t is the union
of En,(cid:96)’s, and therefore, in view of the last paragraph of (1.1), we have introduced the notions

IAn,t, IBn,t for the corresponding subsets of (cid:8)0, . . . , 2n(M +1) − 1(cid:9) (or of {0, 1}n(M +1), via the

For n > 0 and 1 ≤ t ≤ Tn we let:

αn,t := |IAn,t| and βn,t := |IBn,t| ,

α(n, t, ξ) = |IAn,t ∩ {1, . . . , ξ}| , and β(n, t, ξ) = |IBn,t ∩ {1, . . . , ξ}| .

Finally, we let:

(an,t,s|1 ≤ s ≤ αn,t) be the increasing enumeration of IAn,t,
(bn,t,s|1 ≤ s ≤ βn,t) be the increasing enumeration of IBn,t.

In the terminology of [3], the functions of Equation (7c) are the cardinality functions for the
relations of Equation (7e), and the functions of Equations (7di) and (7dii) are the enumerating
functions for these relations.

Proof. Since αn,t = 2n(M +1)P (Stepn(x) = vt
1. follows. For 2., it is clear that (c) is equivalent to (a), and from (1) it then follows that (b) is
also equivalent to (a), so we argue that the admissibility of π is equivalent to (a). Let π be any
permutation of {0, . . . , 2n − 1}, let (cid:96) < 2n(M +1) and let x ∈ Dn,(cid:96), y ∈ En,π((cid:96)). Let s = IStep(n, (cid:96))
and let t = IWeight(n, π((cid:96))). Then s = t iﬀ vs
n(x) = Sn(y) and (a) is equivalent to
the admissibility of π.
For 3., note that an admissible permutation π decomposes into the system of its restrictions
to the IAn,t. Complete information about π (cid:22) IAn,t is encoded by the permutation, πn,t of

Further, the πn,t are arbitrary in the sense that if, for 0 ≤ t ≤ Tn, φn,t is any permutation of
such that for each 0 ≤ t ≤ Tn, πn,t = φn,t. Finally, for ﬁxed n, the product in 3. counts the
number of such systems (φn,t|0 ≤ t ≤ Tn), and so 3. follows.

It is there that we will see the point of the particular choice of the triangular array of positive
integers presented in (1.1) and its apparently peculiar “repetition” (M + 1 times) of each row
length.

(cid:1) = 0, as usual, it is easy to see that the integer entries in the bth block of rows are

For ﬁxed b and ﬁxed 1 ≤ i ≤ b, the entries in the ith column of the bth block are precisely the
ηb,r,i, with 1 ≤ r ≤ M + 1, i.e., the
(M + 1) + i. These are threfore exactly the
members of the intersection of Ji with the bth block of rows. Finally, we have that the elements
of the J i are the entries in the ith (and last) column in the ith block of rows; i.e., J i is the
intersection of the ith column with the ith block of rows, and that for 1 ≤ r ≤ M + 1, ji,r =

3.2. Complexity Estimates: Theorems 2 and 3.
3.2.1. The sequence {Fn}, its natural encoding, F , and Theorem 2. For the next Deﬁnition, recall
Deﬁnition 8 in (3.1), where we deﬁned the bn,t,s and α(n, t, x).

Deﬁnition 9. For all n > 0, Fn is the permutation of(cid:8)0, . . . , 2n(M +1) − 1(cid:9) deﬁned as follows.

If 0 ≤ (cid:96) < 2n(M +1), let t = IStep(n, (cid:96)). Then

Fn((cid:96)) := bn,t,s, where s = α(n, t, (cid:96)).

Then, take F : N × N → N to be the natural encoding of the sequence {Fn}.
In view of 2. of Lemma 1, these Fn are (obviously) very natural admissible permutations of the

(cid:8)0, . . . , 2n(M +1) − 1(cid:9).
of Equation (8), for all 1 ≤ t ≤ Tn, (cid:0)Fn
(cid:9). This is
of (cid:8)0, . . . , 2n(M +1) − 1(cid:9). Note, also, that with t = IStep(n, (cid:96)) and s = α(n, t, (cid:96)), then, in fact,

one aspect of what, in our eyes, justiﬁes the claim that Fn is the simplest admissible permutation
s = 1 + (cid:96) − SMCO(n, t); further, for these t, s, we also have that s = β(n, t, F (n, (cid:96))).

t is the identity permutation of (cid:8)1, . . . , γO

3.2.2. F is P-TIME relative to τ O

(cid:1) and SBC are computable in time polynomial in

n. Building on this, we have:
Proposition 1. As functions of (n, t), with 1 ≤ t ≤ Tn, the function SMCO and the function

Proof. First note that, as a function of (cid:126)k ∈ Kn and of n, (cid:0)n

(cid:1) is computable in time polynomial

in n, by Proposition 4 of [3] and the standard expression for the multinomial coeﬃcient as a
m− fold product of binomial coeﬃcients. The ﬁrst sentence of the Proposition is then immediate
from item (2) of Remark 1.

(cid:126)k

that α is P-TIME relative to τ O
of Remark 3.

1 then follows immediately from item (1) of Remark 2, and
1 follows immediately from (the ﬁrst part of) the ﬁnal sentence
(cid:3)

Remark 4. In (a generalization of) the terminology of [3], we have shown that the relation RIA is
tame relative to τ O
1 . This is because, as noted, immediately after Deﬁnition 8, in the terminology
of [3], α is the cardinality function for RIA.

The next Corollary then follows immediately from Proposition 1 and from Lemma 2 of [3].

Corollary 3. The relation RIA is P-TIME decidable relative to τ O
1 . As a function of (n, t, s)
with 1 ≤ s ≤ αn,t, the function an,t,s of Equation (7di) (Deﬁnition 8) is P-TIME relative to τ O
1 .
Proof. This is simply because, as noted following Deﬁnition 8, the function an,t,s is the enumer-
(cid:3)
ating function for RIA.

We next show, as promised, that the dependence of τ O

2 on O is really only formal. It is now
that we make use of the enumeration, (ςs|1 ≤ s ≤ m) of {0, 1}m introduced in the third paragraph
of (1.1).
Proposition 2. As a function of (n, s, (cid:96), b) with n > 0, 1 ≤ s ≤ m, 0 ≤ (cid:96) ≤ 2n(M +1), 0 ≤ b ≤
n, τ O

We now have the analogue of Lemma 3 of [3]. The argument here is considerably more involved
and delicate, and requires the information encoded in τ O

just a convenience, in view of Proposition 2 . Nevertheless, as with its prototype in [3], a key
ingredient is S. Buss’s suggestion of (something like) a binary search.
Lemma 2. The function β(n, t, ξ) of Deﬁnition 8 is P-TIME relative to τ O
1 .
Proof. In analogy with the proof of Lemma 3 of [3], given n, t, and 0 ≤ x < 2n(M +1), we “walk
down the 1’s of the binary representation of ξ”; here we use the multinomial coeﬃcients to count
as we go. More precisely, with

c(n, ξ, ζ, (cid:126)k) := the frequency of (cid:126)k in

It is also clear that c(n, ξ, ζ, (cid:126)k) = c(n, ξ, ζ, (cid:126)k), unless ξ ∈ C(n, ξ, ζ) and I(cid:126)kn(ξ) = (cid:126)k; in this case
c(n, ξ, ζ, (cid:126)k) = c(n, ξ, ζ, (cid:126)k) + 1. It will, therefore, suﬃce to show that the function c is P-TIME,
which is the burden of what follows.
Let b(ζ), r(ζ), i(ζ) be those b, r, i, respectively, such that, as in (3.1.3), ζ = ηb,r,i. Clearly,
these are P-TIME computable from ζ. Note that if (cid:96) ∈ C(n, ξ, ζ) and i > b(ζ), then (I(cid:126)on((cid:96)))i =
(I(cid:126)on(ξ))i. Let s(n, ζ, (cid:96)) be that s such that (I(cid:126)on((cid:96)))ζ = os, and note that s(n, ζ, (cid:96)) is also that s
such that Ikn,s((cid:96), b(ζ)) < Ikn,s((cid:96), b(ζ) − 1), i.e., such that τ O
2 (n, s, (cid:96), b(ζ) − 1);
thus, s(n, ζ, (cid:96)) is polynomial time computable.
Let D := J b(ζ) ∩ {1, . . . , ζ − 1}, and let d = |D|. For (cid:96) ∈ C(n, ξ, ζ), let σ(cid:96) be that function
σ from D to {0, 1} deﬁned by σ(j) =
. Clearly s(n, ζ, (cid:96)) depends only on σ(cid:96), and
equally clearly, every σ ∈ {0, 1}D arises as σ(cid:96), for some (cid:96) ∈ C(n, ξ, ζ). A key step in what follows
will be to compute the frequency with which this occurs, but for now, this justiﬁes deﬁning

s∗(σ) = s(n, ζ, (cid:96)) for any (cid:96) ∈ C(n, ξ, ζ) such that σ = σ(cid:96).

We are now in a position to prove:

|C(n, ξ, ζ)| = 2(b(ζ)−1)(M +1)+d.

(11)
Proof. (of Equation (11)) We give an explicit bijection h from C(n, ξ, ζ) to the set C∗ of pairs,
((cid:96)∗, σ) with 0 ≤ (cid:96)∗ < 2(b(ζ)−1)(M +1) and σ ∈ {0, 1}D. Given (cid:96) ∈ C(n, ξ, ζ), we let h1((cid:96)) be that (cid:96)∗
such that En,(cid:96) ⊆ Eb(ζ)−1,(cid:96)∗, and let h2((cid:96)) = σ(cid:96). Let h((cid:96)) := (h1((cid:96)), h2((cid:96))). Then, h is one-to-one,
and all y(cid:48) ∈ En,(cid:96)(cid:48), εj (y(cid:48)) (cid:54)= εj(y). Fixing such a j, if j ∈ D, then h2 ((cid:96)(cid:48)) (cid:54)= h2((cid:96)), while if j (cid:54)∈ D,
then h1 ((cid:96)(cid:48)) (cid:54)= h1((cid:96)). But h is also onto, since if 0 ≤ (cid:96)∗ < 2(b(ζ)−1)(M +1) and σ : D → {0, 1},

since if (cid:96), (cid:96)(cid:48) ∈ C(n, ξ, ζ) and (cid:96)(cid:48) (cid:54)= (cid:96), choosing y ∈ En,(cid:96), then for some j ∈ D∪(cid:83)(cid:8)J i|1 ≤ i < b(ζ)(cid:9)

Let (cid:96) be such that y∗ ∈ En,(cid:96). By construction, (cid:96) ∈ C(n, ξ, ζ) and h((cid:96)) = ((cid:96)∗, σ).

(cid:3)

We will continue to work with the bijection h constructed in the proof of Equation (11). Let
It is then clear from the construction of h that for all

It is then clear that c∗ is P-TIME and that:

let y∗ ∈ Eb(ζ)−1,(cid:96)∗, let y ∈ En,ξ. We may assume, WLOG, that y∗ has the following properties,
since, if necessary, it can be modiﬁed to have them, without aﬀecting membership in Eb(ζ)−1,(cid:96)∗:

• εj (y∗) = εj(y), for all j > ζ,
• εζ (y∗) = 0,

Thus, as required, c(n, ξ, ζ, (cid:126)k) is also P-TIME.
It is now, in the light of the proof of Lemma 2, that the “raison d’ˆetre” for our choice of the Pi
ﬁnally appears clearly. For (cid:96) ∈ C(n, ξ, ζ), for i > b(ζ), the (I(cid:126)on((cid:96)))i are completely determined
(by ξ), while for i < b(ζ), the (I(cid:126)on((cid:96)))i are completely arbitrary. It is only (I(cid:126)on((cid:96)))b(ζ) which is
“partially determined”, and the partial determination (by ξ) is completed by the σ(cid:96). This is the
key to the proof of Equation (11), from which the rest of the proof follows easily.

Omitting the analogue of Remark 4, we proceed directly to the analogue of Corollary 3.

Corollary 4. The relation RIB is P-TIME decidable relative to τ O
1 . As a function of (n, t, s)
with 1 ≤ s ≤ βn,t, the function bn,t,s of Equation (7dii) (Deﬁnition 8) is P-TIME relative to τ O
1 .
Proof. This follows from Lemma 2 and Lemma 2 of [3], because b is enumerating function of RIB
while β is its cardinality function, so Lemma 2, above, establishes that RIB is tame. Since it is
(cid:3)
tame, it is P-TIME decidable, by Lemma 2 of [3].
Theorem 2. F is P-TIME relative to τ O
1 .

Proof. Let χ denote the characteristic function of the relation RIB. Let Γ be the three place
relation on N such that Γ(n, (cid:96), (cid:96)(cid:48)) holds iﬀ n > 0, (cid:96), (cid:96)(cid:48) < 2n(M +1) and
(16)

β(n, IStep(n, (cid:96)), (cid:96)(cid:48)) · χ(n, IStep(n, (cid:96)), (cid:96)(cid:48)) = α(n, IStep(n, (cid:96)), (cid:96)).

Much as in [3] (where the analogue of Equation (16) is Equation (7)), we show, ﬁrst, that Γ is
1 and, given n > 0 and (cid:96) < 2n(M +1) there is unique (cid:96)(cid:48) such that
P-TIME decidable relative to τ O
Γ(n, (cid:96), (cid:96)(cid:48)) holds. We next argue that, as a function of (n, (cid:96)), the unique solution, (cid:96)(cid:48), is computable
1 in time polynomial in n. Finally, we show that Γ(n, (cid:96), (cid:96)(cid:48)) holds iﬀ (cid:96)(cid:48) = F (n, (cid:96)). Of
relative to τ O
course this will suﬃce to show that .

By Proposition 1, the functions α and IStep are P-TIME relative to τ O

1 , and by Lemma 2,
the function β is, as well. Since RIB is P-TIME decidable, the function χ is P-TIME. It is then
clear that Γ is P-TIME decidable.
Now suppose n > 0 and (cid:96) < 2n(M +1). Let t = IStep(n, k) and, as in Remark 3, let s =
1 + (cid:96)− SMCO(n, t). Note that (cid:96) = an,t,s (and that s = α(n, t, (cid:96)), so, in particular, α(n, t, (cid:96)) > 0).
By part (2) of Lemma 1, s ≤ βn,t, so bn,t,s is deﬁned and bn,t,s ∈ IBn,t. Of course we have that
s = β (bn,t,s). It is then clear that Γ (n, (cid:96), bn,t,s) and so there is a solution (cid:96)(cid:48) to Γ(n, (cid:96), (cid:96)(cid:48)). As
was the case in [3], it is the fact of multiplying by χ(n, t, (cid:96)) that makes (cid:96)(cid:48) = bn,t,s the unique
solution, since this guarantees that if Γ(n, (cid:96), (cid:96)(cid:48)(cid:48)) holds then (cid:96)(cid:48)(cid:48) ∈ IBn,t. Given this, and that
s = α(n, t, (cid:96)) = β(n, t, (cid:96)(cid:48)(cid:48)) it is then clear that (cid:96)(cid:48)(cid:48) = (cid:96)(cid:48) = bn,t,s. This also makes it clear that,
as a function of (n, (cid:96)), the unique solution, (cid:96)(cid:48), is computable relative to τ O
1 in time polynomial
in n: this is simply because the function b is P-TIME relative to τ O
1 (by Corollary 4), while t
1 , because t = IStep(n, (cid:96)) and
and s are also computable in time polynomial in n, relative to τ O
s = 1 + (cid:96) − SMCO(n, t).

Combining Corollary 1 and Theorem 2 immediately gives:

Theorem 3. The trim strong triangular array representation of {S∗
quence of admissible permutations encoded by F is P-TIME.
3.3. Concluding Remarks: Retrospective Comparisons with [3]. The list of results of [3]
for which we have presented no clear analogues in this paper is as follows:

n} corresponding to the se-
(cid:3)

(1) Propositions 1 and 2 in (3.2) of [3],
(2) All of the numbered items of §4 of [3],
(3) Corollary 4 and Remark 5 of (3.5) of [3].
(4) Proposition 3 of (3.3) of [3], Equation (8) of (3.4) of [3].
Of these, the results listed in items 1., 2., above, do have clear analogues. Further, the proofs
from [3] go over in a straightforward fashion. Nevertheless, we have chosen to omit them on the
grounds that the important point had already been made in the setting of [3]. For the sake of
completeness, we recall that Proposition 1 of [3] shows that “trimness does not come for free” by
constructing a non-trim strong triangular array representations starting from a trim strong one,
while Proposition 2 of [3] is a “non-persistence” result, showing that in any sequence, (πn|n ∈ Z+),
of admissible permutations and any n, it is never true that πn+1 extends πn and that in any trim
strong triangular array representation of {S∗
n}, it is never true that all of the random variables
R∗
n,i in the “nth row reappear among the R∗
n+1,i in the n + 1th row”. The material of §4 of [3]
dealt with the question of constructing variants, (Gn|n ∈ Z+) and (Hn|n ∈ Z+) of (that paper’s
version of) the sequence (Fn|n ∈ Z+). The motivation for the variants is to build some additional
desirable properties into the individual Gn and Hn; for example, the Gn have the property that
if (in the notation of [3]) (cid:96) ∈ An,i ∩ Bn,i, then Gn((cid:96)) = (cid:96).

The situation is diﬀerent, unfortunately, regardiing the results listed in item 4. above. These
[3] results involve obtaining a simple expression for the base-2 exponential function in terms of
any sequence (πn|n ∈ Z+), of admissible permutations (Proposition 3 of [3]) and an even simpler
one in terms of the sequence (Fn|n ∈ Z+) (Equation (8) of [3] for the [3] version of this sequence).
There are no clear analogues of these results, although there is a clear analogue of the method
by which they were obtained in [3]. The basis of that method was the equivalence between being

17

a power of 2 and having (Hamming) weight 1 (and so being a member of Bn,1). The analogue of
the approach taken in [3] for a general sequence, (πn|n ∈ Z+), of admissible permutations is to
consider the increment by 1 of the sum of all of the weight 1 elements, i.e, of all of the members
of Bn,1 (note: γO
n,1 is still equal to n as is easy to see). The problem is that this may no longer be
πn(n) is still the natural thing to consider, but it will depend

the sum of the pure 2-powers:

n(cid:88)

s=1

n

on O in ways that make it diﬃcult to identify what function this gives (though it seems quite
plausible that it is at least as complex as the exponential function with base 2).Here it is, once
again, the absence of a transparent connection between the notion of Weight and the patterns of
1’s in binary expansions

of the) sequence of inverses,(cid:8)F −1

(cid:9). The natural analogue, here would have the function τ O

Finally, concerning the results listed in item (3), above, the content of Corollary 4 of [3] is that
the function SBC of that paper can be simply computed from F and InvF , the (natural encoding
1 in
place of SBC, and we conjecture that this is true, but we have yet to work this out. Whether
or not SBC can be obtained from F alone (or, somewhat more plausibly, from InvF alone is the
subject of the speculative Remark 5 of [3]; similar questions arise naturally here, but, here too,
we have yet to work this out.
