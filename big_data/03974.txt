Beryllium is a simple alkali earth metal, but has been the target of intensive studies for decades because of
its unusual electron behaviors at surfaces. Puzzling aspects include (i) severe deviations from the description of
the nearly free electron picture, (ii) anomalously large electron-phonon coupling eﬀect, and (iii) giant Friedal
oscillations. The underlying origins for such anomalous surface electron behaviors have been under active
debate, but with no consensus. Here, by means of ﬁrst-principle calculations, we discover that this pure metal
system, surprisingly, harbors the Dirac node line (DNL) that in turn helps to rationalize many of the existing
puzzles. The DNL is featured by a closed line consisting of linear band crossings and its induced topological
surface band agrees well with previous photoemission spectroscopy observation on Be (0001) surface. We
further reveal that each of the elemental alakali earth metals of Mg, Ca, and Sr also harbors the DNL, and
speculate that the fascinating topological property of DNL might naturally exist in other elemental metals as
well.

Topological semimetals[1] represent new types of quantum
matter, currently attracting widespread interest in condensed
matter physics and materials science. Compared with nor-
mal metals, topological semimetals are distinct in two essen-
tial aspects: the crossing points of the energy bands occur at
the Fermi level, and some of the crossing points consist of
the monopoles in the lattice momentum space. Topological
semimetals can be classiﬁed into three main categories, topo-
logical Dirac (TD)[2], topological Weyl (TW)[3] and Dirac
node line (DNL) semimetals[4–6], respectively. In the former
two cases of TD and TW, the monopoles form isolated points
in lattice momentum space and novel surface states (i.e., sur-
face Dirac cones and Fermi-arc states) were observed or sug-
gested, such as TD-type Na3Bi[7–10] and Cd3As2[11–13] and
TW-type TaAs-family[14–17] and TW-type-II WTe2[18].

In the third class of DNL, the crossings between energy
bands form a fully closed line nearly at the Fermi level in
the lattice momentum space, drastically diﬀerent from the iso-
lated Dirac (or Weyl) points in the TD and TW. The projection
of the Dirac node line into a certain surface would result in a
closed ring in which the topological surface states (usually
ﬂat bands) can be expected to appear due to the non-trivial
topological property of its bulk phase. According to the pre-
vious DNL modelings[4, 5], the band crossings occur at zero
energy with a constraint chiral symmetry, leading to the ap-
pearance of ﬂat topologically protected surface bands. How-
ever, in a real crystal the chiral symmetry of a band structure
is not exact, thereby suggesting that the DNL does not gen-
erally occur at a constant energy and the DNL-induced topo-
logical surface bands are not ﬂat either. Recently, this type of
DNL states has been predicted in several cases of 3D carbon
graphene allotropes[19], antiperovskite Cu3(Pd,Zn)N[20, 21],
Ca3P2[22], LaN[23], photonic crystals[24] and a hyperhoney-
comb lattice[25], etc. But, all these DNL predictions have yet
to be experimentally veriﬁed. Here, we discover a new DNL

state in beryllium, the ﬁrst known example in pure metals. We
ﬁnd that the presence of the topologically protected (0001)
surface states around the ¯Γ point originates from this DNL
state. Furthermore, realization of the existence of the DNL in
principle oﬀers new opportunities and insights in rationalizing
the long-standing problem[26–34] of the pronounced surface
states in Be.

The metal of beryllium, which crystallizes in the hcp struc-
ture (see Fig. 1a), is a simple sp-bonded metal. Be is un-
usual in three aspects. Firstly, at its bulk phase it is almost
a semimetal, whereas its (0001) surface has the well-deﬁned,
intense and robust surface electronic states[26–28].Here, the
surface density of state at the Fermi level is almost ﬁve times
higher than that of its bulk phase[26, 33, 34]. The sur-
face states of simple metals were often interpreted within
the framework of the nearly-free-electron model[26], how-
ever beryllium behaves surprisingly far beyond this model.
Secondly, the anomalous interplanar expansion[32] as large
as > 4% of the topmost (0001) atomic layer has been ob-
served, diﬀerent from most other pure metals which often
show little relaxations or contractions when cracking into sur-
face. The underlying driving force for the lattice expansion
has again been attributed to unusual electronic states at the
surfaces[35, 36]. Thirdly, the large electron-phonon coupling
(λ = 1.18 )[30] and giant Friedal oscillations[31] have been
found at its (0001) surface. This fact along with the high den-
sity of states at the Fermi level was suggested to be a candidate
to show surface superconductivity[29].

We start by representing the electronic structure of the
bulk hcp Be phase (Fig. 1a) at the ground state within the
framework of density functional theory (DFT) (Supplemen-
tary Materials). The derived electronic band structure of the
hcp Be is shown in Fig. 1c. It is quite similar to previous
calculations[37]. We also derive the Fermi surface of its bulk
phase in Fig. 2a, in a nice accordance with the experimen-

FIG. 2: Fermi surface and the DNL in hcp Be. a, The Fermi sur-
face in bulk hcp Be exhibits two-band features: a six-cornered hole
pockets around the K point in the kz = 0 plane and a six column-
like electronic pockets along the H-K direction. The hole pockets are
perpendicular to the electronic ones in the BZ. b, Illustration of the

T2=1 and (P·T)2=1. The Berry phase γ = HCA(k)dk, where
A(k) is the Berry connection of -iPnhun(k)|▽kun(k)i and C is

a closed loop in the momentum space, can be used to iden-
tify whether or not the DNL occurs[20, 21]. If the loop C is
pierced by a node line, the Berry phase γ = π, otherwise, γ
= 0. Within this relation, a Z2 topological invariant can be
introduced as ω(C)=exp iγ, which equals ±1. Following the
method proposed by Fu and Kane[39], the term of ω(C) can
be expressed as,

ω(Cab) = ξaξb

(1)

where ξa is the product of the occupied band parities at a point.
Using a four parity-invariant points loop[21], Cab − Ccd to de-
ﬁne the boundary of the surface S abcd, the Z2 invariant can
count the number of node lines (N(S )) which pierce the sur-
face, as reads,

(−1)N(S abcd) = ω(Cabcd) = ξaξbξcξd

(2)

It implies that the DNL will occur around the inversion tran-
sition. Additionally, we calculate the Z2 indices at the eight
time-reversal invariant momentums (TRIMs) and obtaine that
the product is +1 at Γ and -1 for all the other TRIMs, as shown
in TABLE I. It evidences the occurrence of a band inversion at
Γ and the DNL appearance around Γ. Since the relation is very
similar to the topological invariants (v0; v1 v2 v3) of inversion-
symmetric topological insulator[39]. The Z2 invariant in Be
can be written as (1; 0 0 0).

tal measurement[38]. Its Fermi surface clearly consists of two
parts: a coronet-like shape of six-cornered hole pockets on the
kz=0 plane, and a cigar-like shape of six equivalent electronic
surfaces along the H-K symmetry direction. Nevertheless, a
crucial feature was ignored in those previous studies. That
is the appearance of two clear band crossings featured by a
nearly linear dispersion around the Fermi level. One (crossing
A) exactly locates at the Fermi level in the M-Γ direction and
the other one (crossing B) lies about 0.8 eV above the Fermi
level along the Γ-K direction. Actually, these two crossings
are induced by the band inversion. At the centre of the Bril-
louin zone (BZ, see Fig. 1b), Γ, it can be seen that the band
s → pz inversion occurs between No.2 and No.3 bands due to
the crystal ﬁeld eﬀect (Fig. 1c). Remarkably, the band cross-
ings indeed not only appear at these two isolated A and B, but
also form a circle-like closed line around the Γ point on the
kz=0 plane in BZ. This is the exact sign of the DNL appear-
ance. As elucidated in Fig. 2b, the band crossings between
No.2 and No.3 do not happen at the same energy, but show a
periodic wave-like closed curve upon the k vectors around the
centered Γ point. In addition, this DNL’s stability is highly ro-
bust, protected by the inversion and time-reversal symmetries
without the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) eﬀect. Because of the
light mass of Be, its SOC eﬀect can be ignored.

Accordingly, we further illustrate the topology of the DNL
states in Be. Since a Bl¨och Hamiltonian H(k) is invariant
under the inversion (P) and time-reversal (T) operations in a

To further elucidate the topological feature in beryllium, we
have also constructed a 2×2 Hamiltonian within the frame-
work of the low-energy k·p model in describing two bands

specting time-reversal, and D6h symmetries, the model Hamil-
tonian around Γ can be written as,

and the eigenvalues of the model Hamiltonian are E(k) =

ǫ(k)±pM2(k) + B2(k). In this case, the gapless solutions of
Equ. (3), at which the Dirac node line would appear, can be
yielded only when both M(k) and B(k) equal zero. Within
this condition, on the kz=0 plane the node line locates at |k|
= ±q−
which requires m0mk is always smaller than zero.
This is also the condition of the band inversion occurrence.
With other words, when band inversion happens, in the lack
of SOC, there always exists a node line in the momentum
space, which are the solutions of M(k) = B(k) =0. Noted that
the band inversion only occurs at Γ among all TRIMs for Be
according to the abovementioned topology analysis, a Dirac
node line would occur around the Γ point in agreement with
the calculated electronic stricture.

Using this Hamiltonian to describe the (0001) surface
bands, the topologically nontrivial surface states could be ex-
pected. Since the (0001) surface is perpendicular to c-axis,
we can use -i∂z instead of kz according to the theory to the
linear order and then the (0001) surface Hamiltonian can be
expressed as follows,

H sur f

Due to the Jackiw-Rebbi problem [40], there will be a topo-
logical boundary mode with the condition of m0+mk k2 < 0.
This suggests the presence of the topologically nontrivial sur-
face states, which would nestle the projected Dirac node ring.
To clarify this point, we calculate the surface electronic struc-
tures by varying the thickness of the slab as shown in Fig.
3a-3f. As expected, the robust surface electronic bands (SF-
band 1 in Fig. 3f ) appear, when the slab’s thickness is above
ﬁve unit cells along the c-axis. As shown in Fig. 3f, from
the crossing A to B point the topological surface bands are
two-fold degenerated within the projected Dirac node ring. It
can be seen that the topological surface bands along the ¯K-
¯Γ- ¯H direction disperse parabolically from the lowest energy
of -2.73 eV (expt[26, 38]: -2.80 eV and -2.75 eV, referred to
the Fermi level) at ¯Γ , and then cross the Fermi level at 47 %
(expt[38]: 49%) of the ¯Γ- ¯K distance and 64% (expt[38]: 58%)
of the ¯Γ- ¯M distance, in nice agreement with the experimental

FIG. 3: The evolution of thickness-dependent surface electronic
band structures of the Be (0001) surface. a to e, the derived sur-
face electronic structure is shown as a function of the slab thickness
from 5 unit cells (ucs) to 25 ucs along c-axis with an increasing of
5 ucs thickness of every image. It can be seen that, with increas-
ing the thickness, the surface states (red curves) almost remains un-
changed and the bands touch more closely at both crossing A and B
points, which correspond to the band crossing points projected by the
bulk energy bands. f, Surface electronic band structure with a slab

ﬁndings (see squares in Fig. 3f) obtained by ARPES[26, 38].
Particularly, it has been noted that the surface bands around
the ¯Γ and ¯M points are highly diﬀerent. The topologically
protected SF-band 1 around the ¯Γ point are mainly comprised
with s and pz-like electronic states from the topmost atomic
layer, reﬂecting well the crucial feature of the band inversion
between s and pz in its bulk phase (Fig. 1c). This SF-band 1 is
indeed half-ﬁlled when the surface is electrically neutral. The
other two surface bands around ¯M (SF-band 2 and 3 in Fig.
3f) are the topologically trivial states, which are not correlated
with the DNL state. The SF-band 2 is mainly composed with
in-plane px,y-like electronic states from the topmost surface
atomic layer, whereas the SF-band 3 mainly consists of the
px,y-like electronic states from the second outer atomic layer.
Obviously, these SF-bands 2 and 3 are fully occupied when
the surface is electronic neutral.

We have further derived its Fermi surface of the (0001) sur-
face in Fig. 4a. Because the DNL exists on the kz = 0 plane in
the BZ, the DNL projection onto the (0001) surface shows
a closed circle (Ring A in Fig. 4a) surrounding ¯Γ within
which the topologically protected surface bands (Ring B in
Fig. 4a) appear. Although the Ring B was already observed
by ARPES[38] (Fig. 4b and 4c), it was not interpreted as
the DNL-induced topologically non-trivial bands. The under-
standing of the surface states (SF-band 1 in Fig. 3f and Ring
B in Fig .4a) has also been a long-standing question since the

4

non-trivial surface states are also obtained on (0001) surface
by surface calculations, which are also in nice agreement with
experiments(Supplementary Materials). Metals of Ca and Sr,
which are isovalent to Be and Mg, crystallize in fcc structure
with the truncated-octahedron Brillouin zone. These two met-
als also exhibit the DNL-like topological feature. On each
hexagonal face of the Brillouin zone, the valence and con-
duction bands cross each other to form a closed loop which
surrounds the center of the hexagonal face. Topological sur-
face states can also be observed clearly on their symmetrically
equivalent {111} surfaces. However, diﬀerent from Be their
topological surface bands locate outside the projected DNLs
because the band inversion occurs outside the DNLs.

In summary, through ﬁrst-principle calculations, we pro-
pose that 3D topological DNL semimetal states can be ob-
tained in pure alkali earth metals of beryllium, magnesium,
calcium and strontium. The anomalous topological surface
bands are obtained on the (0001) surface of Be (and Mg), and
in nice agreement with previous experimental observations.
This fact conﬁrms that the previous observed anomalous elec-
tron behaviors on Be (0001) surface should be induced by the
topological non-trivial DNL state in its bulk and rationalize a
series long-standing puzzling physical properties on its (0001)
surface. The perfect agreement of physical properties between
theoretical predictions of DNL semimetals and experimental
observations on Be (0001) surface makes beryllium a good
platform for researching topological DNL semimetals. On the
other hand, the discovery of DNL states in alkali earth metals
implies that this fascinating topological property might also
exist in other elemental metals, supporting a new direction for
designing topological DNL semimetals.

1980s[26–34]. It was suspected to be correlated with unusu-
ally large outward relaxation of the topmost surface atoms,
so-called p to s electron demotion as well as the core-level
shifts[26–28, 32–34]. However, those proposed mechanisms
did not address the underlying physical origin for the appear-
ance and stability of the surface states[26]. Due to our calcula-
tions, the SF-band 1 state is highly robust, no matter whether
the surface slab modeling are relaxed or not (Supplementary
Materials). Therefore, it is undoubtable that the SF-band 1
is induced by the topological DNL feature in its bulk phase.
Looking back on the unusual physics properties of Be (0001)
surface, the puzzlings can be rationalized by the presence of
topologically non-trivial DNL states. The DNL induced topo-
logical surface bands would certainly behave far beyond the
nearly-free-electron model, and the nearly ﬂat dispersion of
them results in very large electron density of state nearby
the Fermi level of (0001) surface, which would cause giant
electron-phonon coupling eﬀect and Friedal oscillations. Ad-
ditionally, we would like to mention that, as early as in 1970,
the Landau quantum oscillations of the magnetic susceptibil-
ity has been observed when the magnetic ﬁeld was set to be
parallel to the c-axis direction[41]. This seems to be another
exciting sign to elaborate the DNL property in Be because
the magnetic ﬁeld certainly breaks the time-reversal symme-
try and gap out the crossings to modify the Fermi surface.

Finally, we have also found the similar topological DNL
feature in Mg, Ca and Sr. Mg is isostructural and isovalent to
Be and their electronic band structures look highly similar to
each other. In Mg (which is similar to Be) there also exists a
DNL around the Fermi level and, the topologically protected
