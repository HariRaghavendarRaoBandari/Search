A note on small periodic solutions of discrete nonlinear

Klein-Gordon equations

Masaya Maeda

March 8, 2016

Abstract

In this note, we consider discrete nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations with potential. By the
pioneering work of Sigal, it is known that for the ”continuous” nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation,
no small time periodic solution exists generically ([8, 10, 1]). However, for the discrete nonlinear
Klein-Gordon equations, we show that there exist small time periodic solutions.

1

Introduction

In this note, we consider discrete nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations:

utt + Hu + m2u + up = 0,

(t, j) ∈ R × Z,

(1.1)

where u(t, j) is a real valued unknown function, m > 0, p ∈ N, p ≥ 2 and H = −∆ + V with

• (∆u) (j) = u(j + 1) − 2u(j) + u(j + 1) and,
• (V u) (j) = V (j)u(j) and |V (j)| → 0 as |j| → ∞.

Discrete nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation (1.1) can be considered as a discretized model of the
”continuous” nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation:

(t, x) ∈ R × Rd,
where d ≥ 1 and H = −∆ + V with ∆ being the usual Laplacian on Rd.

utt + Hu + m2u + up = 0,

We now assume that (in both continuous and discrete cases),

σd(H) = {e}, with m2 + e > 0,

(1.2)

(1.3)

where σd(H) is the set of discrete spectrum of H. We further set φ to be the normalized eigenfunction
of H associated to e. Under such assumption, for the linear Klein-Gordon equation:

utt + Hu + m2u = 0,

(1.4)

one can easily show that there exists a family of periodic solutions

ψ(t) = aφ sin ωt, where ω =pm2 + e and a ∈ R.

1

Notice that such periodic solutions are stable under suitable linear perturbation of the equation
(perturbation of V ). This fact comes from the stability of eigenvalues of H under small perturbation
of V (see for example [5], [7]).

On the other hand, in the continuous case, it was shown by Sigal [8] that periodic solutions are
unstable under generic nonlinear perturbation. More precisely, under some generic nondegeneracy
assumption (which we will explain below), there are no periodic solutions near ψ for the perturbed
equation:

utt + Hu + m2u + ǫup = 0,

where ǫ is small. By a simple scaling argument, we see that Sigal’s result corresponds to the
nonexistence of small periodic solution of (1.2). Later, Soﬀer-Weinstein [10] and Bambusi-Cuccagna
[1] improved this result by showing that all small solutions scatter and therefore no periodic solution
exists. More precisely, in the case d = 3 and p ≥ 3, they showed that all small solutions behaves
like linear solutions of (1.4) with V ≡ 0. Here, Soﬀer-Weinstein [10] considered the case σd(H) =
{− 3
4 m2 < e < 0} and Bambusi-Cuccagna [1] generalized it to the case σd(H) = {−m2 < e1 < ··· <
en < 0}.
We now brieﬂy explain the mechanism which prohibits the existence of periodic solutions by
following [1]. First, recall that nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation is a Hamiltonian equation. That
is, (1.2) can be rewritten as

where (u, v) = (u, ut) and

˙v = −∇uH,

˙u = ∇vH,

1

H(u, v) =

1

p + 1Z up+1 dx.
We now decompose (u, v) with respect to the spectrum of H = −∆ + V such as
v = qφ + Pcv, where Pc = 1 − h·, φi φ.

2Z (cid:0)v2 + |∇u|2 + V u + m2u2(cid:1) dx +

u = pφ + Pcu,

Further, we introduce the complex variables

ξ =

qω1/2 + ipω−1/2

√2

,

f =

B1/2Pcu + iB−1/2Pcv

√2

The complex variables now satisfy the system
i ˙ξ = ∂ ¯ξH,

i ˙f = ∇ ¯fH.

where B =pH + m2.

(1.5)

Our task now becomes to show that ξ decays to 0 as t → ∞. In particular, we want to show that
the system exhibits some kind of dumping for ξ even though it is a Hamiltonian (conserved) system.
To show this we use Birkhoﬀ normal form argument. After a canonical change of the coordinate,
the Hamiltonian can be reduced to the eﬀective Hamiltonian Heﬀ ”+error”, where

Heﬀ = ω|ξ|2 + hBf, fi +(cid:10)ξN G, f(cid:11) ,

for some G ∈ S (Schwartz function). Here, hf, gi = ReR f ¯g dx and N is the smallest natural number
satisfying (N − 1)2ω2 < m2 < N 2ω2.
Remark 1.1. The condition σd(H) = {− 3
4 m2 < e < 0} given in Soﬀer-Weinstein [10] corresponds to
the case N = 2.

2

Then, by (1.5), the equations for ξ and f (ignoring the error terms) are given by

i ˙ξ = ωξ + N ¯ξN −1Z ¯Gf dx,

i ˙f = Bf + ξN G.

Now, if we take i ˙ξ ∼ ωξ as a ﬁrst approximation, we have f ∼ −ξN (B − ωN − i0)−1G. Then,
substituting this again into the equation of ξ and multiply by ¯ξ and taking the imaginary part, we
obtain,

d

dt|ξ|2 = −2N ω2Γ|ξ|2N , Γ = Im(cid:10)(B − ωN − i0)−1G, G(cid:11) .

Notice that one can show Γ ≥ 0. Therefore, if we assume Γ 6= 0 (which implies Γ > 0), we see that
ξ decays, which is the desired result.
The formula of Γ is the nonlinear analogue of Fermi Golden Rule which appears in the theory of
resonance in quantum mechanics (see, for example [7, 9]). In the following, the word Fermi Golden
Rule will simply mean for the coeﬃcient Γ. The nonvanishing of Fermi Golden Rule (Γ 6= 0) is
assumed for all papers [8], [10] and [1].
Notice that it is crucial to have ωN ∈ σcont(B) (continuous spectrum of B), because if ωN 6∈

σ(B), then

Im(cid:10)(B − ωN − i0)−1G, G(cid:11) = Im(cid:10)(B − ωN )−1G, G(cid:11) = 0,

and if ωN ∈ σd(B), we will not be able to deﬁne (B− ωN − i0)−1. As a conclusion, the nonvanishing
assumption of Fermi Golden Rule is a nondegeneracy condition related to the nonlinear interaction
between continuous spectrum and the discrete spectrum. The nonlinear interaction occurs because
the nonlinearity create new frequencies n2ω2 which eventually collides with the continuous spectrum
of H + m2 which is [m2,∞) in the continuous case.
Now, we come back to the discrete case. In this case, the continuous spectrum of H is [0, 4].
This implies that there is a possibility that the frequencies n2ω2 may ”jump over” the continuous
spectrum (there are also possibilities that m2 + e > m2 + 4 from the beginning). In such cases, one
can expect that there are no nonlinear interaction between the point spectrum and the continuous
spectrum. This means that one can expect the existence of periodic solutions of the nonlinear
problem (1.1) and this is what we show in this note.

Remark 1.2. The above observation for the discrete case was ﬁrst given by [2] for the discrete
nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation in the context of the asymptotic stability of small standing waves.

Assumption 1.3. We assume that σd(H) = {e} where e 6∈ [0, 4] with dimker(H − e) = 1. Further,
we assume m2 + e > 0. We set ω = √m2 + e and assume

n2ω2 − m2 6∈ [0, 4]
We set φ to be the normalized eigenfunction of e.

for all n ∈ N.

(1.6)

Remark 1.4. The condition (1.6) is the crucial assumption that guarantees there is no nonlinear
interaction between the point spectrum and the continuous spectrum. Notice that this kind of
condition is never satisﬁed in the continuous case because in this case, the r.h.s. of (1.6) has to
become [0,∞).
Remark 1.5. If we assumePj∈Z(1 + |j|)|V (j)| < ∞, we have dimker(H − e) = 1. See Lemma 5.3 of

[4].

In this note, we use the following notations.

Ln(X; Y ) := L(X;Ln−1(X; Y )) for n ≥ 2 and L1(X; Y ) := L(X; Y ).

(1.7)

(1.8)

We note that Theorems 1.7 corresponds to Theorems 1.6 of [6] for the discrete nonlinear
Schr¨odinger equations with potential. In the (continuous and discrete) nonlinear Schr¨odinger equa-
tion case, because of the gauge invariance, one can easily show that there exist small periodic
solutions of the form eiωtφ(x). However, under the assumption of the nonvanishing of Fermi Golden
Rule, no small quasi-periodic solution exists ([8, 12, 14, 13, 11, 3]). On the other hand, due to the
boundedness of the continuous spectrum, one can expect that there exist quasi-periodic solutions of
two modes and this is shown in [6].

The proof of Theorem 1.7 is parallel to [6] and actually more simple than [6] because in this
case we are only handling a periodic solution and not a quasi-periodic solution. However, we would
like to present the proof in this note because of its simplicity and moreover we are not aware for
similar results of this kind besides [6].

2 Proof of Theorem 1.7

In this section, we prove Theorem 1.7. We start from the ansatz:

Φ[z] = (z + ¯z) φ +Xn≥0

(zn + ¯zn) vn,

with hv1, φi = 0. We assume that z satisﬁes

i ˙z =pE + m2z,

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

where E = e + ε. Then, our task is to determine v = {vm}m≥0 and ε for given z to make Φ[z] to be
the solution of (1.1) when z satisﬁes (2.2). Assuming (2.2), we have

d2

dt2 Φ[z] = −(e + ε + m2) (z + ¯z) φ −Xn≥1

(cid:0)H + m2(cid:1) Φ[z] = (e + m2)(z + ¯z)φ +Xn≥0
(zn + ¯zn)wn(|z|2, v),

(Φ[z])p = Xn≥0

n2(e + ε + m2) (zn + ¯zn) vn,

(zn + ¯zn)(H + m2)vn,

where the third line is the deﬁnition of wn(|z|2, v). Therefore, we have the following system:

ε =(cid:10)φ, w1(|z|2, v)(cid:11) ,
(H − e)v1 = εv1 − (1 − Q)w1(|z|2, v),
(cid:0)H − (n2(e + m2) − m2)(cid:1) vn = n2εvn − wn(|z|2, v), n 6= 1,

where Q = h·, φi φ. We deﬁne ε(|z|2, v) to be the r.h.s. of (2.3). Thus, it remains to determine v for
given |z|2. We now set

Xa,r := {v = {vn}n≥0 ⊂ la

e | kvka,r := Xn≥0

rnkvnkla

e

< ∞},

and try to reformulate (2.4)-(2.5) as a ﬁxed point problem (we think (2.3) is the deﬁnition of ε). Set

Pv := {(1 − δn1Q) vn}n≥0,

and X c

a,r := PXa,r.

We next set the operators A, B on X c

a,r as

Av = {(H − (n2(e + m2) − m2))−1vn}n≥0,
Bv = {(H − (n2(e + m2) − m2))−1n2vn}n≥0,

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

a,r.

where v = {vn}n≥0 ∈ X c
Remark 2.1. By (1.6) in Assumption 1.3, we see that each (H − (n2(e + m2) − m2))−1(1 − δn1Q)
exists. Notice that if (1.6) do not hold, we will not be able to invert H − (n2(e + m2)− m2) for some
n ≥ 1 and our strategy completely fails. Further by the discussion given in the introduction of this
note, we expect there exists no periodic solution.

To express {wn(|z|2, v)}n≥0, we introduce the following multilinear operator on Xa,r.

Deﬁnition 2.2. Let vk = {vk,n}n≥0 for k = 1, 2. We deﬁne M(|z|2, v1, v2) = {Mn(|z|2, v1, v2)}n≥0
by

Xn≥0

(zn + ¯zn)Mn(|z|2, v1, v2) = Xn1≥0
We inductively deﬁne Mk(|z|2, v1,··· , vk) by

(zn1 + ¯zn1)v1,n1 Xn2≥0

(zn2 + ¯zn2)v2,n2 .

M2(|z|2, v1, v2) = M(|z|2, v1, v2) and

Mk(|z|2, v1,··· , vk) = M2(|z|2, v1,Mk−1(|z|2, v2,··· , vk)),

and set Mk(|z|2, v) := Mk(|z|2, v,··· , v).

Let

Then, we can express W(|z|2, v) := {wn(|z|2, v)}n≥0 as

Φ0 := {δn1φ}n≥0.

W(|z|2, v) = Mp(|z|2, Φ0 + v).

Using (2.3), (2.6), (2.7), (2.8), (2.10) and (2.11), we deﬁne

Φ(|z|2, v) := ε(|z|2, v)Bv + APMp(|z|2, Φ0 + v).
Then, we can reformulate the system (2.4)-(2.5) as a ﬁxed point problem

v = Φ(|z|2, v).

Proof. We only show the claim of the lemma for the case p = 2. For the cases p ≥ 3, we can easily
show the clam from the inductive deﬁnition of Mp. By (2.9), for vk = {vk,n}n≥0 ,

m0(v1, v2) = {m0,n(v1, v2)}n≥0 = {v1,nv2,0 + Xn≥n1≥0

Thus, we have mm ∈ L2(Xa,r; Xa,r). Further, if |z|2 < r2, Pm≥0 |z|2mkmmkL2(Xa,r ;Xa,r ) converges.
Therefore, we have M ∈ Cω(BR(δ2);L2(Xa,r; Xa,r)).

We deﬁne C by

C(v) := hφ, v1i , where v = {vn}n≥0.

Since |C(v)| ≤ kφkl2kv1kl2 ≤ r−1kφkl2kvka,r, we see C ∈ L(Xa,r; R). Using, C and Mp, we can
express ε by

Therefore, we have

ε(|z|2, v) = C ◦ Mp(|z|2, Φ0 + v).

Remark 2.5. If p is even, then ε(|z|2, 0) = 0 because (z + ¯z)p has no term such as z|z|2m.
Proof of Theorem 1.7. Let δ < r. By Lemma 2.4 and (2.15), we have Φ ∈ Cω(BR(δ2) × X c
Further, for v1, v2 ∈ Xa,r and z ∈ BC(δ),

Therefore, we see that Φ(|z|2,·) is a contraction mapping on BX c
(Crp) for some C > 0 and r ≪ 1.
By contraction mapping theorem, we have v ∈ Cω(BR(δ2); X c
We have Theorem 1.7 because Φ[z] = (z + ¯z)φ +Pn≥0(zn + ¯zn)vn(|z|2) is a solution of (1.1).
Notice that the estimate (1.8) follows from Remark 2.5 above.

A Exponential decay of eigenfunction of H

This appendix is devoted for the proof of the following proposition.
Proposition A.1. Let e ∈ R \ [0, 4] be the eigenvalue of H = −∆ + V and let φ ∈ l2 be the
normalized eigenfunction of H associated e. Further, assume dimker(H − e) = 1. Then, there exists
a > 0 s.t. φ ∈ la
e .
Set Ta : la
e → l2 by

(Tau) (j) := ea|j|u(j).

Before the proof of Proposition A.1, we claim that the following fact holds.

Lemma A.2. Under the assumptions of Proposition A.1, for suﬃciently small a > 0 there exist
ea ∈ R and φa ∈ l2(Z) \ {0} s.t. ea → e as a → 0 and
Ta(−∆ + V )T −1

a φa = eaφa.

(A.1)

Proposition A.1 is a direct consequence of Lemma A.2

Proof of Proposition A.1 assuming Lemma A.2. Since φa satisﬁes (A.1), we have

e ֒→ l2. Therefore, ea is an eigenvalue of H. However, since ea → e as
Since φa ∈ l2, T −1
a → 0 and e is an isolated eigenvalue, ea has to be equal to e if a > 0 is suﬃciently small. Therefore,
since dimker(H − e) = 1, there exists ca ∈ R s.t.

Finally,

Therefore, we have the conclusion.

Before proving Lemma A.2, we show that TaHT −1

Lemma A.3. There exists a bounded operator Ba : l2 → l2 s.t. kBakl2→l2 . a s.t.

Therefore,

and we have the conclusion.

We now prove Lemma A.2.

k(cid:0)Ta(−∆)T −1

Proof of Lemma A.2. We show that there exist δa > 0 and ua ⊥ φ (i.e. hφ, uai = 0) s.t. ea = e + δa
and φa = φ + ua satisfying (A.1). Let Ba be the bounded operator given in lemma A.3. Then, it
suﬃces to ﬁnd a pair (ea, ua) satisfying

Taking the inner-product between (A.2) and φ, we have

(H − e)ua = δa(φ + ua) − Ba(φ + ua).

δa = hBa(φ + ua), φi .

(A.2)

(A.3)

Applying Pc to (A.2) and taking the inverse of (H − e) (this is invertible in Pcl2, where Pc is the
orthogonal projection with respect to φ), we have

ua = (H − e)−1Pc ((hBa(φ + ua), φi − Ba) (φ + ua)) .

(A.4)

So, setting Ψ(u) equal to the r.h.s. of (A.4), it suﬃces to ﬁnd a ﬁxed point of Ψ. First,

kΨ(0)kl2 = k(H − e)−1Pc ((hBaφ, φi − Ba) φ) kl2 ≤ C0a,

for some constant C0 > 0 independent to a. Second, for v, w ∈ l2 with kvkl2,kwkl2 ≤ 1, we have
kΨ(v) − Ψ(w)kl2 = k(H − e)−1Pc (hBa(v − w), φi (φ + v) + (hBa(φ + w), φi − Ba) (v − w)) kl2

≤ C1akv − wkl2 ,

for some constant C1 > 0 independent of a, v and w. Therefore, if max(C0, C1)a < 1/2, for u, v
with kukl2,kvkl2 < 2C0a, we have

kΨ(u)kl2 ≤ kΨ(u) − Ψ(0)kl2 + kΨ(0)kl2 ≤ C1a · 2C0a + C0a < 2C0a,

and kΨ(u)− Ψ(v)kl2 ≤ 1
{u ∈ l2 | kukl2 ≤ 2C0a. Therefore, we have the conclusion.

2ku − vkl2 . This implies that Ψ is a contraction mapping on Bl2(0, 2C0a) =
