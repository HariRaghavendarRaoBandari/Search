Abstract

We describe the ﬁnite-size spectrum in the vicinity of the quantum critical point between a Z2 spin liquid

and a coplanar antiferromagnet on the torus. We obtain the universal evolution of all low-lying states

in an antiferromagnet with global SU(2) spin rotation symmetry, as it moves from the 4-fold topological

degeneracy in a gapped Z2 spin liquid to the Anderson “tower-of-states” in the ordered antiferromagnet.

Due to the existence of nontrivial order on either side of this transition, this critical point cannot be

described in a conventional Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson framework.

Instead it is described by a theory

involving fractionalized degrees of freedom known as the O(4)∗ model, whose spectrum is altered in a

signiﬁcant way by its proximity to a topologically ordered phase. We compute the spectrum by relating

it to the spectrum of the O(4) Wilson-Fisher ﬁxed point on the torus, modiﬁed with a selection rule

on the states, and with nontrivial boundary conditions corresponding to topological sectors in the spin
liquid. The spectrum of the critical O(2N ) model is calculated directly at N = ∞, which then allows
a reconstruction of the full spectrum of the O(2N )∗ model at leading order in 1/N . This spectrum is

a unique characteristic of the vicinity of a fractionalized quantum critical point, as well as a universal

signature of the existence of proximate Z2 topological and antiferromagnetically-ordered phases, and can

be compared with numerical computations on quantum antiferromagnets on two dimensional lattices.

INTRODUCTION

Recent numerical studies [1, 2] of the spin S = 1/2 antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice

have presented convincing evidence for a spin liquid ground state in the presence of a next-nearest

neighbor exchange interaction (J2). They also ﬁnd an apparently continuous transition to an
antiferromagnetically ordered ground state at smaller J2, with the familiar 3-sublattice coplanar
order of the triangular lattice. Here we will assume that this antiferromagnetic state is the same as

the conventional state described by the semiclassical spin-wave theory, and possesses only integer

spin excitations. So the transition from the spin liquid to the antiferromagnet is a conﬁnement

transition, associated with the conﬁnement of half-integer spin excitations.

An attractive candidate for the observed spin liquid is the Z2 spin liquid [3–6]. The purpose
of our paper is to examine a conﬁnement transition of the Z2 spin liquid on a torus geometry.
The torus is characterized by a length scale, a circumference L, and a modular parameter τ . At

a continuous quantum phase transition associated with a conformal ﬁeld theory, the low-lying

quantum states on a torus have an energy proportional to c/L (where c is a spin-wave velocity,

which will henceforth be set to unity), with proportionality constants which are universal functions

of τ . We will show that this torus spectrum contains characteristic signatures of the topological

order of the proximate Z2 spin liquid. The spectrum exhibits a universal crossover from the 4-fold
in our
topological degeneracy of the Z2 into the characteristic spectrum of the conﬁning phase:
case the conﬁning phase has long-range antiferromagnetic order and has a low-lying Anderson

“tower-of-states” [7–9] signaling the spontaneous breaking of the SU(2) spin-rotation symmetry.

It is our hope that these results on the spectrum of the critical point will aid numerical studies of

quantum antiferromagnets, and help identify the topological order of proximate spin liquid phases.

A theory of a conﬁnement transition of the Z2 spin liquid was initially presented in Refs. 4 and
10, in terms of a frustrated Ising model obtained from an ‘odd’ dimer model; the same theory

appeared later in other models [11–13], and in recent work [14–16]. This conﬁnement transition

can be interpreted in terms of the condensation of the m particle (the ‘vison’) of the toric code

[17], but with the modiﬁcation that the m particle carries non-trivial quantum numbers of the

space group of the underlying lattice; the latter feature leads to lattice symmetry-breaking in

the conﬁning state. In other models [18], including the toric code and ‘even’ dimer models, the

m particles transforms trivially under the space group, and then the conﬁning state does not

break any symmetries. A theory for the ﬁnite-size spectra across such a non-symmetry-breaking

conﬁnement transition, along with exact diagonalization results in a model system, appear in a

separate paper [19].

In the present paper, we are interested in the case where the condensing particle carries half-

2

integer quantum numbers of the total spin, and this is conventionally associated with the conden-

sation of the e particle (the ‘spinon’) of the toric code. A theory for the condensation of spinons

in a Z2 spin liquid on the triangular lattice was presented in Refs. 20 and 21, and this theory will
form the basis of our computations here. The order parameter of the coplanar antiferromagnet is

identiﬁed by points on the SO(3) manifold, and so the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson (LGW) frame-

work suggests a ﬁeld theory based on such an order parameter. However, the theory of Refs. 20

and 21 is a ‘deconﬁned’ critical theory beyond the LGW paradigm, and is instead expressed in
terms of a spinon order parameter which is identiﬁed by points on SU(2)≡ S3.

The connection between coplanar magnetic order and the spinon in the spin liquid phase can

be made explicit. We write the expectation value in the ordered state as

hSji = Shn1 cos(cid:16) ~Q · ~xj(cid:17) + n2 sin(cid:16) ~Q · ~xj(cid:17)i

(1)

where the ordering wave vector is ~Q = 4π(cid:0)1/3, 1/√3(cid:1) for the semiclassical ground state of the

Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice. The vectors n1,2 are arbitrary up the constraints

n2
1 = n2

2 = 1,

n1 · n2 = 0.

(2)

Diﬀerent orientations of these two vectors are related by a rotation matrix, identifying the order

parameter as an element of SO(3). A conventional LGW description of a transition from this

magnetically ordered state to a paramagnetic state would begin with an eﬀective action for the

ﬂuctuations of the vectors n1,2. However, this phase transition would drive the system into a trivial
gapped paramagnetic state with a non-degenerate ground state, which cannot occur in a system

with an odd number of half-integer spins per unit cell such as the triangular antiferromagnet [22].

Therefore, we seek a description in terms of fractionalized degrees of freedom. Following Refs. 20

and 21, we write

n1a + in2a =

2

Xα,β,γ=1

ǫαγzγσa

αβzβ

(3)

This parametrization explicitly solves the constraints in Eq. (2), and it can be checked that
the complex bosonic ﬁeld zα, with α =↑,↓, transforms as an S = 1/2 spinor under spin rota-
tions. However, this representation is doubled-valued: one can perform a gauge transformation,
zα(x, τ ) → η(x, τ )zα(x, τ ), η = ±1, at any point in space-time and obtain an equivalent representa-
tion of the physical order parameter. This identiﬁes the order parameter space as SU(2)/Z2, which
is equivalent to SO(3). This description is complementary to the conﬁnement transition described

above, where zα is identiﬁed with the SU(2) spinon of the Z2 spin liquid. We note that as the
spinon condenses, the only remnant of the massive vison in the spin liquid is the double-valued

nature of the spinon ﬁeld.

3

We therefore write a critical theory for the complex boson zα consistent with the allowed
symmetries. Keeping only terms relevant at the critical point, the universal Lagrangian of the

transition in 2+1 dimensional spacetime is

L = |∂µzα|2 + s|zα|2 + u(cid:0)|zα|2(cid:1)2 .

(4)

The ‘mass’ s has to be tuned to a critical value s = sc to access the critical point, while u
approaches a non-zero value determined by the Wilson-Fisher ﬁxed point [23]. Note that this spin-

1/2 relativistic boson is not in contradiction with the spin-statistics theorem, because here ‘spin’

refers to a global ﬂavor symmetry, rather than the intrinsic angular momentum of relativistic

particles. We will allow the index α to range over 1 . . . N, and obtained results in the 1/N
expansion. Note that the theory L has O(2N) symmetry, and so we will be examining properties
of the O(2N) ﬁxed point.

A ﬁrst guess towards obtaining the spectrum on the torus is that we simply have to solve the

theory L on the torus with periodic boundary conditions on the spinon ﬁeld zα:

zα(x + iy + n1ω1 + n2ω2) = zα(x + iy)

(5)

where x, y are the spatial co-ordinates, n1,2 are integers, and ω1,2 are the complex periods of the
torus with τ = ω2/ω1; we choose |ω1| = L. These boundary conditions would be appropriate if
we were solving for the spectrum of an O(2N) rotor model, for a transition from an ordered state
with hzαi 6= 0 to a trivial paramagnet with hzαi = 0.

in our case we are considering a transition to a paramagnet with Z2 topological
order, and this does have important consequences for the spectrum of the critical theory. A

However,

ﬁrst consequence follows from the fact that no physical operator can be associated with a single
zα operator, and all observables involve at least bilinears of zα and z∗
α. The periodic boundary
conditions on the torus apply to the physical spin operators of the antiferromagnet, and so for the

spinons we have the more general boundary conditions [19]

zα(x + iy + n1ω1 + n2ω2) = ±zα(x + iy).

(6)

The anti-periodic boundary conditions correspond to the presence of a vison ﬂux in the correspond-

ing cycle of the torus. In the Z2 spin liquid, such boundary conditions lead to the near four-fold
degeneracy of the ground state, with the states diﬀering by an energy which is exponentially small

in L. At the quantum critical point, this degeneracy evolves into additional states which are spaced

by an energy of order 1/L.

A second consequence arises from the fact that the all states share the same number of spinons

modulo 2. In other words, if the underlying lattice antiferromagnet has an even (odd) number of

4

S = 1/2 spins on the torus, then all states will carry integer (half-integer) spin. This implies that

the wavefunctional, Ψ, of the critical theory obeys [19]

Ψ[−zα(x + iy)] = η Ψ[zα(x + iy)]

(7)

where η = +1 (−1) for an even (odd) number of spins. We postulate here that there is a universal
spectrum at the critical point between the Z2 spin liquid and an ordered antiferromagnet which
is described by the O(2N) critical theory in Eq. (4) subject to the boundary condition in Eq. (6)
and the constraint in Eq. (7). Following the notation of Ref. 11, we will call this the O(2N)∗

critical theory, while the theory obeying the boundary condition in Eq. (5) is the conventional
O(2N) theory. It was previously pointed out [24] that the O(2N)∗ critical theory has a distinct

entanglement entropy from the O(2N) theory; our results show that the distinction also applies

to the ﬁnite-size spectrum on a torus.

In the application to the lattice antiferromagnet, we also have to consider the fact that the
O(2N) symmetry of L is an emergent symmetry of the critical point, and is not a symmetry of the
underlying Hamiltonian. So we have to consider operators which break the O(2N) symmetry. All

operators which break the O(2N) symmetry down to SU(N) are irrelevant at the critical point,

and we will consider here only the leading irrelevant operator. This is given by [20, 21]

L′ = γ|z∗

α∇zα|2

(8)

We also describe the leading perturbative eﬀect of γ on the critical spectrum.

We will begin in Section II by a description of the torus spectrum of the O(2N) critical theory
in the 1/N expansion. This will be followed by the corresponding results for the O(2N)∗ critical
theory in Section III. The eﬀects of L′ will be considered in Section IV.

II. CRITICAL O(2N ) SPECTRUM: LARGE N

A. General formalism

In this section, we develop our formalism for the large-N expansion of the critical O(2N) model.

For a review of the large-N expansion, see Ref. 25. We take the Euclidean action

u

2N (cid:0)|zα|2(cid:1)2(cid:17) .

We choose a slightly diﬀerent notation for the couplings compared with Eq. (4), which will simplify

subsequent expressions. We will perform the large N expansion at ﬁxed u, and tune the quadratic

We associate all points related by a lattice vector nω1 + mω2 for n, m ∈ Z, where the complex numbers

coupling to its critical value s = sc. Subsequently we will take the u → ∞ limit in each term to
obtain the scaling limit. We will also consider deviations from the critical coupling s − sc.

The ﬁeld theory is deﬁned on a spatial torus, which can be parametrized by complex coordinates
w = x + iy. The torus is deﬁned by two complex periods ω1 and ω2, an area A = Im(ω2ω∗
1), and
we deﬁne the dimensionless modular parameter τ = ω2/ω1 with real and imaginary parts denoted
τ = τ1 + iτ2. The geometry is shown in Fig. 1. We also deﬁne the length scale L ≡ |ω1| =pA/τ2.

In this geometry, the basis vectors of the dual lattice are given by

so a general momentum vector takes the form

k1 = −iω2/A,

k2 = iω1/A,

kn,m = 2π (nk1 + mk2) ,

n, m ∈ Z.

This equation is to be solved for ∆, yielding an answer of the form ∆ = #/L, where # is a
universal function of L(s − sc) independent of the regularization scheme at large momenta. In
this paper, we use dimensional regularization to evaluate divergent sums, which sets sc = 0. The
computation is given in Appendix A, and in terms of the special functions deﬁned there, the gap

equation becomes

1/2(∆, τ ) = −2πL(s − sc),

which is solved numerically. At the critical point, s = sc, the gap ∆ depends only on the geometry
of the torus. We note that ∆ is a monotonically increasing function of (s − sc).

the λ propagator at N = ∞ is

This is related to the propagator of |zα|2. This is most easily seen directly from the action (13),
where λ is not a dynamical ﬁeld. Integrating out the ﬁeld iλ is equivalent to replacing it by its

equation of motion,

2 − ∆2(cid:17) .
So the propagator of λ is related to the propagator of |zα|2 by

This can also be veriﬁed by coupling a source J to |zα|2 and taking functional derivatives [26].

The enlarged O(2N) symmetry rotates spinons into anti-spinons, so we deﬁne b†

α with indices
running from α = 1, ..., 2N which can create either particle. The single-particle states are created

by a single z ﬁeld, so by the form of the z propagator, their energy is given by the Hamiltonian

where α = 1, ..., 2N. The energy of the state b†

α(k)bα(k),

α(k)|0i is given by
E1(k) = E0 +p|k|2 + ∆2.

(28)

(29)

This state is in the fundamental representation of O(2N), so it is 2N-fold degenerate in addition

to any degeneracies between values of k.

Two particle states with momentum k take the form

α(q)b†
b†

β(k − q)|0i

(30)

for all choices of momentum q. We decompose this into irreducible representations of O(2N),

which must separately have deﬁnite energy:

γ(cid:19) ≡ δαβS + Aαβ + Tαβ.

(31)

These are the singlet, antisymmetric tensor, and symmetric traceless tensor representations re-
spectively. Simple counting shows that S creates one state, Aαβ creates N(2N − 1) states, and
Tαβ creates (2N − 1)(2N + 2)/2 states. Note that if q = k − q, the antisymmetric representation
will not be present.

At this point we can use the analysis above. At N = ∞, the z propagator takes the form of a
free boson with dispersionp|k|2 + ∆2, so one would na¨ıvely expect all states to have energy given

by the Hamiltonian (28). However, this is not the case for the singlet state, since

h|zα|2(x, τ )|zβ|2(0, 0)i ∝ hλ(x, τ )λ(0, 0)i.

(32)

So the fact that that the propagator of λ takes a nontrivial form at N = ∞ has the eﬀect of
shifting the energy of singlet states. The energies of the singlet states are given by the poles in

9

D(k, iω), or equivalently the zeros of Π(k, iω). From Eq. (23) we see that Π is always convergent

in d = 2, so we can sum the series numerically to ﬁnd the singlet energies, which are given by

Π(k, E(S)

2

(k)) = 0.

(33)

In contrast the antisymmetric tensor and symmetric traceless tensor remain degenerate at N = ∞,
giving 4N 2 − 1 degenerate states with energy

E2(k) = E1(q) + E1(k − q)

(34)

for all choices of the momentum q, where E1(q) is the single particle energy, Eq. (29). The choice
of q can also induce additional degeneracies for any given total momentum k.
In addition, we
saw that if q = k − q there will be no antisymmetric part, so there will only be a degeneracy of
(2N − 1)(2N + 2)/2 from O(2N) symmetry.

Going beyond the two-particle states, we expect that a general state will be given by an appli-

cation of

α(k1)b†

σ(k4) · · ·|0i.

β(k2)b†

γ(k3)b†

(35)

Past the two-particle states, the decomposition into irreducible representations becomes more

involved. Generally, the states will decompose into singlets with energies given by the zeros of

Π, and states described by O(2N) traceless tensors with energies given by by Fock spectrum of

Eq. (28). Extra degeneracies can occur due to discrete point group symmetries of the torus, and
sometimes degeneracies are reduced if some of the b†s are indistinguishable.

C. Evolution of the spectrum of a function of s − sc

In this section, we discuss the general structure of the ﬁnite-size spectrum as a function of s−sc,
which can be worked out on general principles in the limits s = sc, s ≫ sc, and s ≪ sc. We show
that our model takes the correct form in these limits before giving explicit results on the evolution
of the as s − sc is varied.

At criticality, s = sc, the system at an inﬁnite volume has full conformal invariance, and there
is no scale in the theory. The excitation spectrum forms a gapless continuum, E = k. As a result,

when the system is placed on a torus, the only possible dependence that the energy can have on the

size of the system is 1/L. Therefore, the quantities LE will be universal functions of τ only. This

dependence is automatic from our ﬁnite-size calculations, where the solution to the gap equation

will give a pure number for L∆, and all energies manifestly have 1/L dependence.

In the disordered phase, s > sc, the system develops a gap m even at L = ∞, and the low-
energy excitations will take the form E =p|k|2 + m2. In the scaling limit, m is of order (s − sc)ν

and ν = 1 at N = ∞. This energy gap implies that all correlations decay exponentially over a
length scale 1/m ∼ 1/(s − sc), resulting in a very weak dependence on ﬁnite-size eﬀects when the
system is placed on a torus of size L, provided Lm ∼ L(s − sc) ≫ 1. Therefore, we expect the
ﬁnite-size spectrum of the disordered phase to evolve to the form E = p|k|2 + ∆2 at increasing
(s − sc), where ∆ = m + O(e−Lm) takes the same value as it does in an inﬁnite volume up to
exponentially small corrections in L(s − sc), and the momenta k are quantized according to the
required boundary conditions. We also note that the threshold for singlet excitations in an inﬁnite

volume is 2m, so the absence of large ﬁnite-size corrections suggests that the two-particle singlet

spectrum will merge with the other two-particle states.

The properties of the disordered phase can be veriﬁed explicitly. By taking the L → ∞ limit

of Eq. (18), we ﬁnd the exact gap in an inﬁnite volume,

m = 2π(s − sc).

The energies of the two-particle singlet states can be veriﬁed to merge with the other two-particle

states in this limit.

In the ordered phase, s < sc, the ﬁnite-size spectrum diﬀers considerably from the inﬁnite
volume case. In an inﬁnite volume, there is a degenerate ground-state manifold of states at zero

momentum which are related by the O(2N) symmetry, and a properly prepared system will pick a

single one of these states, spontaneously breaking the symmetry. The stable excitations above the
ground state consist of 2N − 1 Goldstone modes with a linear dispersion, E = c|k|, corresponding
to transverse ﬂuctuations of the order parameter about its ground state value. In addition, there

will be an unstable continuum of excitations associated with transverse ﬂuctuations of the order
parameter and ﬂuctuations of its amplitude φ2

α, which will be mixed by interactions [26].

In contrast, in a ﬁnite volume the ground state must be a non-degenerate O(2N) singlet, and

spontaneous symmetry breaking is impossible. Instead of a ground state manifold, there will be
a “tower of states” above the ground state at k = 0 with energies scaling as E ∼ 1/A with the
system size [7–9, 27–29]. In the thermodynamic limit, this tower “collapses” into the ground state,

and a symmetry-broken state can be formed as an extensive superposition of states in the tower.

One can analyze the general properties of the tower of states by forming an eﬀective Hamiltonian

for their spectrum. This can be derived by integrating out the ﬁnite-momentum modes and ﬁnding

an eﬀective Hamiltonian for the zero-momentum component of the ﬁeld [30]. For a system with

O(2N) symmetry, the eﬀective Hamiltonian for the tower takes the form

Htower = E0 +

L2

κAN (sc − s)

(38)

up to corrections induced by ﬂuctuations of the ﬁnite momentum modes. Here, Li, i = 1, 2, .., N(2N−
1) are the generators of rotations in O(2N), and κ is a constant which will be non-universal away

from the scaling limit. The eﬀective Hamiltonian for the tower is simply an O(2N) rigid rotator,

and the energy levels are given by

Etower = E0 +

,

ℓ = 0, 1, 2, ...

(39)

This constrains the level spacing between states in the tower. In our present calculation, we take
the N = ∞ limit, and obtain equally-spaced energy levels. We note that for the physical cases

of interest the splitting will be diﬀerent; below we consider an O(4)∗ transition where one takes

N = 2 and ℓ even, resulting in a splitting of 2ℓ(2ℓ + 2) up to the irrelevant splittings discussed in

Section IV. The eigenfunctions of Eq. (38) in the angular basis are the hyperspherical harmonics on
S2N −1, which are the higher-dimensional generalization of the familiar spherical harmonics on the

two-sphere. These eigenfunctions are in the symmetric traceless tensor representations of O(2N),

and their degeneracy is given by

(40)

We can verify the above structure in our model by taking the limit s ≪ sc in the gap equation

(18). We ﬁnd that the gap takes the form

∆ =

1

A(sc − s)

+ O(cid:0)(A(sc − s))−2(cid:1) ,

s ≪ sc.

(41)

The states created purely by |k| = 0 will form an equally spaced spectrum above the ground state
with this 1/A dependence on the system size, and by the analysis in Section II B they will be in
the symmetric traceless tensor representations of O(2N), in agreement with the above analysis.
The states created by ﬁnite-momentum operators will have an energy given by E = |k| +
O(∆2/|k|), and transform in either traceless tensor or singlet representations. These correspond
to the Goldstone modes in the inﬁnite-volume system, but there will be no distinction between

the longitudinal and transverse ﬂuctuations since symmetry is unbroken. We note that even the

zero-momentum states created by the singlet operator approach the expected spectrum for multi-

particle Goldstone states.

For an explicit example, we consider the square torus, τ = i, where both spatial directions have

length L. Precisely at s = sc, the energy levels are a set of universal numbers times 1/L; in Table
I we have given the lowest-lying energy levels at the critical point and their total degeneracy. We
show the evolution of the spectrum LE as a function of L(s − sc) in Figure 2, choosing states
which highlight important features of the spectrum.

We also give results for the cylinder, τ2 → ∞, in Figure 3. The presence of an inﬁnite dimension
changes the nature of the spectrum considerably, but there are still universal quantities to compute.

Since the ground state energy is extensive, diverging with the area of the system, we plot the
universal ground state energy density LE0/τ2 = L3E0/A instead. Also, since particles can take
a continuous momentum along the direction of the cylinder, the spectrum above the gap is a
continuum given by particles with energy √k2 + ∆2. However, the gap remains a universal quantity
which we plot in Fig. 3. We also note that in the ordered phase, the gap no longer scales with 1/A
since the area is inﬁnite. Instead, the gap becomes exponentially suppressed in the circumference

III. CRITICAL O(2N )∗ SPECTRUM

We now consider the O(2N)∗ model, where the spinons can take anti-periodic boundary condi-

tions along either direction of the torus. We treat the four topological sectors as separate decoupled

theories for now. The boundary conditions can be taken into account by simply by noticing that

momentum quantization is shifted by a half-integer in the anti-periodic direction. We parametrize

the momentum as

kn,m = 2π [(n + a1)k1 + (m + a2)k2] ,

n, m ∈ Z,

(43)

where the ki were deﬁned in Eq. (10), and the values of a1, a2 are determined by the boundary
conditions, see Table II.

This redeﬁnition of allowed momenta is all that is needed to reproduce the calculations in II A.

We can still use the special functions deﬁned in the appendix (which are deﬁned for arbitrary

boundary conditions), and we solve the same gap equation for ∆,

and have the same formula for the ground state energy,

1/2(∆, τ ) = −2πL(s − sc),

However, we can now ﬁnd the gap and the ground state energies in all four topological sectors of

the theory, and we will see below that the splitting between the ground-state energies is important.

TABLE III. Energy splittings L(E − E0) and their degeneracies at s = sc for the O(4)∗ transition from
the large-N expansion with τ = i. Here, κ = L|k|/2π. The ground state energy relative to L = ∞
is LE0 = −1.317. Here we restrict to states which are even in the ﬁelds zα, which corresponds to an
antiferromagnet with an even number of spins.

The ground-state energies are proportional to N, so the energy splittings in the O(2N)∗ theory

will be N-dependent in the 1/N expansion, unlike the O(2N) case above.

One consequence of the anti-periodic sectors is that there is no zero mode, so the massless free
particle spectrum |k| already has a gap. As a result, the saddle-point value of i˜λ = ∆2 determined
through Eq. (44) can take negative values, provided p|k|2 − |∆2| is real for all possible values of

k.

We now consider the constraint of Eq. (7), requiring that the wavefunctional must be either an

even or odd function of the zα. These two cases correspond to an even or odd number of spins
in the underlying lattice antiferromagnet of interest. In terms of the results in Section II B, this

means we need to calculate the full spectrum for all of the relevant boundary conditions, and then

separate the spectrum into the states with even particle-number states and odd particle-number

states to describe the two possibilities.

A. Evolution of the spectrum of a function of s − sc

When considering the deviation from the critical point, the topologically nontrivial sectors

correspond to extra features in the two neighboring phases.

In a Z2 spin liquid, the ground
state on a torus will exhibit a four-fold degeneracy up to exponential splitting in the system

TABLE IV. Energy splittings from L(E − E0) for the O(4)∗ transition from the large-N expansion with
τ = i and N = ∞. Here, κ = L|k|/2π, and we restrict to states which are odd in the ﬁelds zα, which
corresponds to an antiferromagnet with an odd number of spins. We are measuring the energies with

size. In addition, excited states in each topological sector will also contain a four-fold degeneracy

corresponding to excitations in the background of diﬀerent ﬂux sectors through the holes of the

torus. This topological degeneracy is the only remnant of the vison particle, which has been
integrated out to obtain the O(2N)∗ model, so our theory only captures the spectrum at energies

well below the vison mass.

This degeneracy is easily veriﬁed in our model; as shown above, the phase with s > sc will
have an energy gap even in an inﬁnite volume, which results in the spectrum showing a weak

dependence on boundary conditions. This will cause the diﬀerent topological sectors to become
degenerate up to an exponential splitting of magnitude e−mL where m = 2π(s − sc). From solving
Eq. (44) for s ≫ sc, one ﬁnd that in all four sectors the gap approaches ∆ = m up to exponential
corrections in the system size, and similarly the ground state energies in this limit will become

exponentially close.

In the magnetically ordered phase, s < sc, the antiperiodic boundary conditions have an inter-
pretation as vortices of the order parameter. This can be seen from the parametrization of the

order parameter in terms of the spinon degrees of freedom in Eq. (3). As the spinon ﬁeld under-
goes a smooth non-contractible twist around a cycle of the torus, zα → −zα, the physical order
parameter returns to its original conﬁguration after traversing a topologically nontrivial path in

order parameter space. These correspond to vortices associated with the ﬁrst homotopy group,

π1(SO(3)) = Z2. Note that by only allowing twists in the order parameter around the torus, we

are ignoring local vortex conﬁgurations. This simpliﬁcation is analogous to ignoring the local vison

excitations in the spin liquid phase, since a local vortex will have some extra energy cost due to

its core.

The energy cost of a vortex can be estimated by dimensional analysis. On general grounds, in

the ordered phase we can write the energy functional for the phase θ(x) of the order parameter as

III and IV, which contain the even and odd spin results respectively. We also give the evolution
of the spectrum as a function of s − sc in Figure 4, choosing some representative states to depict
the nature of the two phases. We also give universal results for the cylindrical limit in Figure 5.

We plot the splitting between the ground state energy densities in the two sectors, as well as the

excitation gap which is simply twice the gap for the O(4) model. Above the excitation gap, the

spectrum becomes a continuum due to the momentum along the inﬁnite direction, so there are no

universal energy levels.

IV. ANISOTROPIC CORRECTIONS

We now consider to the leading irrelevant operator in our theory,

L′ = γ|z∗

α∇zα|2.

(50)

Asymptotically close to the critical point, this term is irrelevant and will not contribute to universal

physics. However, this term is dangerously irrelevant because it breaks the O(2N) symmetry down

to SU(N) for any deviation from the scaling limit. Therefore, the actual energy levels for the

transition will organize into SU(N) multiplets for any lattice model, with a splitting determined

by γ. The coeﬃcient γ is non-universal and will be determined by microscopics, so in principle

one must ﬁt its value to a given spectrum.

We begin by discussing the nature of the splitting in terms of representation theory. The real and

imaginary parts of zα transform together as an O(2N) vector, but this representation will transform
reducibly under the SU(N) symmetry of Eq. (50). Labelling the irreducible representations by their

dimension, the splitting of the O(2N) vector into SU(N) representations is

2N −→ N ⊕ N,

(51)

where N and N are the fundamental and anti-fundamental representations of SU(N), which we

will shortly associate with spinons and anti-spinons. We can analyze the breaking of higher rep-

resentations of O(2N) by taking tensor products of the fundamental representation. For example,

the splitting of the two-particle states can be obtained by taking the antisymmetric or symmetric

tensor product of the O(2N) vector, and use the known properties for adding SU(N) representa-

The single particle energies of spinons and anti-spinons are shifted by the same amount, so there

is no splitting to one-particle states to leading order.

We will explicitly compute the shift in energies for the two-particle states in Eq. (55), which
are all degenerate at N = ∞ except for the singlet state in the last line. The perturbation will
split these states, and can also split any possible degeneracy between states with the same total

momentum. We ﬁrst ignore the latter possibility, which does not occur for any of the states

listed in the above tables. Recall that the two-particle state energies can be written as E2(k) =

The subscripts refer to the states being in the symmetric, antisymmetric, singlet, or adjoint rep-

resentations of SU(N).

Summarizing the results to ﬁrst order in γ, the degeneracy of the antisymmetric representation
breaks down from N(2N − 1) to N(N − 1), N 2 − 1, and 1, while the degeneracy of the symmetric
traceless tensor representation breaks down from (2N − 1)(2N + 2)/2 to N(N + 1) and N 2 − 1.
Note that the ﬁrst-order correction is zero if the unperturbed particles all have zero momentum.

Therefore, to ﬁrst order there is no splitting of the “tower of states” in the antiferromagnetic phase.

Although we do not compute the magnitude for the splitting of the states in the tower, we comment

on the expected representations which should appear. In Section II C we saw that the tower of

states for the O(2N) model all belong to the symmetric traceless tensor representations. For the
case of interest, N = 2, the allowed degeneracies in the tower becomes (2ℓ + 1)2 for ℓ = 0, 1, 2, ...

where we use the constraint that only an even number of particles are allowed. Repeating the

above analysis by forming symmetric products and subtracting out the traces, one ﬁnds that each

of these states decomposes into (2ℓ + 1) diﬀerent SU(2) representations each with spin-ℓ. We also
note that the spacing of the even-particle spectrum for the O(4)∗ model should be proportional to
2ℓ(2ℓ + 2) ∝ ℓ(ℓ + 1), which agrees with the spacing for the tower in an SU(2) antiferromagnet [28].
This qualitative structure of the spectrum, with (2ℓ + 1) inequivalent spin-ℓ multiplets in the tower

becoming approximately degenerate close to the critical point, is an interesting feature of this
theory which could give good evidence for the existence of an O(4)∗ transition and a neighboring

spin liquid phase.

For a deﬁnite example, we revisit the results for the even sector of the O(4)∗ model on the

square torus. In Table V, we explicitly show all the two-particle states from Table III which are

split by the perturbation, and give the magnitude of the splitting. Note that the numerical value

V. CONCLUSIONS

There have been extensive discussions in the literature on the nature of the ﬁnite size and

low energy spectrum of quantum antiferromagnets in antiferromagnetically ordered and gapped

topological phases. For magnetically-ordered antiferromagnets, we have the well-known “tower of

states” [7–9, 27–29] obtained from the excitations of a quantum rotor representing the spatially

uniform collective quantum ﬂuctuations of all the spins; such a spectrum is characteristic signature

of the spontaneously broken spin rotation symmetry. On the other hand, antiferromagnets with an

energy gap and topological order have low energy states whose energy diﬀerences are exponentially

small in the system size; again, this nearly degenerate spectrum is a characteristic signature of the

23

topological order in this phase of the antiferromagnet.

In the present paper, we have presented results on the evolution of the spectrum between

the above two limits. We examined a two-dimensional antiferromagnet, with global SU(2) spin

rotation symmetry, which undergoes a transition between a gapped Z2 spin liquid and coplanar
antiferromagnetic order. Such a transition is described by a O(4)∗ conformal ﬁeld theory in 2+1

dimensions, which is closely related to the O(4) Wilson-Fisher conformal ﬁeld theory. We showed

that the quantum critical point has a universal spectrum, in which the energy levels are universal

numbers times 1/L, where L is the spatial system size. This spectrum contains features which

descend from the phases found on either side of the critical point. The topological degeneracy on

the gapped side evolves into non-trivial boundary conditions and selection rules on the operators

of the conformal ﬁeld theory. And the spontaneously broken spin-rotation symmetry on the other

side yields low-lying states with non-zero spin at the critical point.

We hope that our results will aid in analyzing numerical data on lattice quantum antiferromag-

nets which undergo transitions from antiferromagnetically ordered to spin liquid states. With the

available data on the manner in which the “tower of states” evolve into the spin liquid across a

quantum critical point, strong constraints become available on identifying the topological order in

the spin liquid.

Appendix A: Loop sums

Here we review the calculation of loop diagrams in a ﬁnite volume using dimensional regular-

ization.

To remind the reader of our notation, we parametrize the coordinates on the spatial torus in

complex coordinates w = x + iy, and denote the two periods in these coordinates as ω1 and ω2
(see Fig. 1). We deﬁne the modular parameter τ ≡ ω2/ω1 and the length scale L ≡ |ω1|. In this
geometry, the basis vectors of the dual lattice are given by

k1 = −iω2/A,
24

k2 = iω1/A.

(A1)

The eigenvalues of the Laplacian are dependent on the boundary conditions of the torus. We

consider the ﬁelds to be either periodic or anti-periodic in either direction. With this in mind, we

write the eigenvalues of the Laplacian as

|kn,m|2 = (2π)2 |(n + a1)k1 + (m + a2)k2|2 ,

n, m ∈ Z.

(A2)

Here, the numbers a1 and a2 parametrize whether the boundary conditions on the ﬁelds are periodic
or anti-periodic in the directions ω1 and ω2, see Table II.

A general one-loop diagram will be of the form

Xn,m∈Z

1

2π (cid:19)2s
(|kn,m|2 + ∆2)s =(cid:18) τ2L

Xn,m∈Z

1

(|m + a2 + (n + a1)τ|2 + γ2)s

(A3)

where τ = τ1 + iτ2 and γ = τ2L∆/2π (we have used τ2 = A/L2).

We now generalize this sum to arbitrary dimension. This is done by promoting the two-

dimensional vector (n+a1, m+a2) to a d-dimensional vector of (half) integers for the (anti-)periodic
case. Then in (A3) we simply take the sums to be over n, m ∈ Zd/2. We will write the sums as

g(d)

s (∆, τ ) = Xn,m∈Zd/2

1

(|m + a2 + (n + a1)τ|2 + γ2)s .

We can now write the sum in terms of the two-dimensional Riemann theta function, deﬁned as

As with the original sum, the function (A8) converges whenever s > d/2, while for s < d/2,

the integral diverges for small values of λ. We proceed by splitting the integral into two parts,

with v2 = −i(a1, a2). Since Θ → 1 for large λ, we see that the integral has the expected UV
divergence. In this paper, we evaluate sums with s = 1/2 and s = −1/2 in d = 2, so we add and
subtract the divergent terms for these cases, evaluating integrals where possible in the convergent

In the main text, we gave universal results for the cylindrical limit, which is τ1 = 0, τ2 → ∞.
This can be done either by considering formulating the problem on the cylinder to begin with,

or by taking the limit of the special function in Eq. (A13). The limit requires needs to be taken
carefully because of the competing dependences g(d)
on τ2, but by similar manipulations to the
s
above derivation the limits can be extracted. For the two cases we use in the text, the limits are

given by

Here we have used the Jacobi theta function, deﬁned as

ϑ3(iπa, b) ≡Xn∈Z

exp(cid:0)−πbn2 − 2πan(cid:1) .

The gap on the cylinder can be obtained by using Eq. (A16) in the gap equation (18). From
Eq. (A17), we see that g(2)
−1/2 diverges in the cylindrical limit. This is related to the area dependence
of the ground state energy, which is given by

E0 =

2πN
τ2L

−1/2(∆, τ ) +

N(s − sc)

(A19)

The ground state energy is proportional to τ2 in this limit, diverging as the area becomes inﬁnite.
However, the dimensionless ground state energy density, LE0/τ2 = L3E0/A, remains a universal
function of s − sc which we compute the in main text.

Appendix B: 1/N corrections

Here we mention the form of the leading 1/N corrections, following a similar notation to Ref. 26.

First we need to calculate the critical coupling sc to order 1/N. This is done by solving the inﬁnite-
volume gap equation (15), where we write the inﬁnite volume saddle point as i˜λ = r + iλ/√N:

r

27

(B1)

The coupling sc should be tuned so that the the energy gap in an inﬁnite volume vanishes. We do
this by working backwards: we ﬁrst calculate the energy gap as a function of r, then tune r such

that the energy gap vanishes, and ﬁnally deﬁne sc through Eq. (B1). From the action (13), the
relevant self-energy diagram corrections to the zα propagator are

Note that Π∞(0, 0) is really infrared divergent, but it can be regulated, and it cancels out of

physical values [26]. In this case, using dimensional regularization, we notice that

(B5)

So r is of order 1/N 2 at the critical point in two spatial dimensions, and from Eq. (B1), the critical
coupling is of order 1/N 2 in dimensional regularization. Therefore, there is no 1/N correction to

the ﬁnite volume gap equation (15).

We can now calculate the self-energy corrections to the zα in a ﬁnite volume. These are given

by a similar calculation to the one above, but now with loop sums,

The spectrum is then obtained by solving G−1(k, E(k)) = 0.

There are also 1/N corrections to the singlet states. To compute these, we need the nonlinear

terms in the eﬀective action for λ, (22). To order 1/N these are

order 1/N correction to the inverse propagator is given by
