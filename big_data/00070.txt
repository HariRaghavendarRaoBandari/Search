Properties of the depleted Heisenberg spin ladder material series (C7H10N)2Cu1−zZnzBr4 have
been studied by the combination of magnetic measurements and neutron spectroscopy. Disorder-
induced degrees of freedom lead to a speciﬁc magnetic response, described in terms of emergent
strongly interacting “spin island” objects. The structure and dynamics of the spin islands is studied
by high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering. This allows to determine their spatial shape and to
observe their mutual interactions, manifested by strong spectral in-gap contributions.

In the solid state, even weak perturbations may lead
to qualitatively new physics described in terms of en-
tirely new emergent degrees of freedom and quasiparti-
cles [1]. One such perturbation, known to open the door
to a variety of novel and competing ground states and
rich phase diagrams, is structural or chemical disorder
[2]. An exciting example of disorder-induced emergent
degrees of freedom are the magnetic objects that ap-
pear upon the introduction of non-magnetic impurities in
gapped quantum-disordered antiferromagnets (AFs) [3–
8]. These entities may be understood as spins released
from non-magnetic AF singlets by removing their part-
ner spins. The short-range correlations in the underlying
quantum AF spread these spin degrees of freedom over
extended regions (“spin-islands”) around each impurity
site [3]. The size of the spin islands is controlled by the
correlation length in the parent system, and may be as
large as dozens of nanometers. Due to their partial over-
lap, these spin islands interact. The original quantum
AF thus acts as a “medium” that hosts a new magnetic
system of mesoscopic objects and carries interactions be-
tween them. Due to these interactions, the emergent sys-
tem may have its own unique correlations and dynamics.

The impurity-induced formation of localized S = 1/2
spin objects has been thoroughly studied in gapped S = 1
Haldane spin chains [4, 9–13]. Unfortunately, in these
highly one-dimensional chain materials, each impurity
completely severs the host system. The emergent spin
islands located at the chain segment ends merely pair
up into isolated dimers [4], and have no collective dy-
namics. This is in contrast to expectations for Heisen-
berg spin ladders, which are composed of two neighbor-
ing chains linked by rung interactions J⊥. Within this
topology, the non-magnetic impurities have a low chance
to disrupt the continuity of the system and a ﬁnite-size
segment typically contains a large number of mutually
interacting islands. To date, the study of non-magnetic
impurities in spin ladders was limited to rather complex
materials with prohibitively large energy scales, such as

Sr(Cu1−zZnz)2O3 [14] or Bi(Cu1−zZnz)2PO6 [5]. These
cases are diﬃcult to describe theoretically, as they involve
additional interactions such as cyclic exchange, frustra-
tion, or 3D coupling. What is missing is an experimen-
tal study of emergent and interacting spin islands in a
clean realization of the spin ladder model, such that could
be compared to theoretical calculations at the quanti-
tative level. Fortunately, in recent years, a number of
new exceptionally good organic spin ladder compounds
were discovered [15]. Among them, (C7H10N)2CuBr4
(DIMPY) [16, 17] realizes the rare case of a strong-
leg spin ladder, which is of special interest in the con-
text of the present study. Its dominant leg interactions
imply a signiﬁcant correlation length and hence signif-
icant interactions between emerging spin objects, even
at low concentration.
In the present Letter we show
that DIMPY, diluted with nonmagnetic zinc, is indeed
a perfect prototype for testing this physics. By com-
bining thermodynamic and high-resolution inelastic neu-
tron scattering experiments with numerical simulations,
we are able to directly study the shape and interactions
of the spin islands, and to quantitatively describe the
impurity-induced collective response in the language of
these emergent objects.

The parent material DIMPY was shown to be de-
scribed by a simple Heisenberg spin-ladder Hamilto-
nian with J(cid:107) = 1.42(6) meV along the leg and J⊥ =
0.82(2) meV (see Fig. 1) [17–19] and with exception-
ally weak additional interactions [20–22]. We were able
to chemically introduce non-magnetic impurities by re-
placing a fraction z of magnetic S = 1/2 Cu2+ by non-
magnetic Zn2+ ions [23]. The magnetic susceptibility and
isothermal magnetization data are presented in Fig. 2,
as measured on a series of (C7H10N)2Cu1−zZnzBr4 sin-
gle crystals with varying impurity concentration z [24].
While the susceptibility of the z = 0 parent compound
is being dominated by a spectral gap of ∆ = 0.33 meV
and exponentially decays to zero at low temperatures,
the susceptibility of the Zn-diluted material acquires an

Fig. 2) quantitatively reproduce the measured data in
the entire temperature- and ﬁeld-range. This proves not
only that we are able to chemically control the zinc con-
centration but also that its introduction does not lead to
signiﬁcant local distortion eﬀects altering the superex-
change interactions.

Extensive QMC calculations of large depleted systems,
averaged over hundreds of conﬁgurations, are expensive,
time-consuming and yield little physical insight. An al-
ternative, much simpler approach is provided by the ef-
fective low-energy description in terms of interacting spin
islands (Fig. 1c,d) [3, 26]. The latter are represented by
S = 1/2 spins SI at random impurity positions I, in-
teracting with distance-dependent eﬀective interactions

additional paramagnetic-like contribution, progressively
increasing with the impurity concentration. This behav-
ior becomes even more apparent in the low-temperature
magnetization (Fig. 2b). The latter remains suppressed
by the gap below the critical ﬁeld of Hc (cid:39) 2.7 T [17]
in the clean material but acquires an impurity-induced
contribution in the Zn-substituted derivatives. Nonethe-
less, the observed response is not simply described by
the S = 1/2 Brillouin function, as it would in case of
free magnetic moments [25]. While deviations from the
Brillouin function are small at low impurity concentra-
tions, they become up to 45% at z = 0.06. Qualita-
tively, this is explained by the mean impurity distance
Lx(z) = (1 − z)/(2z − z2) [26] which is as large as 50
unit cells for z = 0.01 but becomes comparable to the
correlation length ξ ≈ 6.3 [24] at z = 0.06. The probabil-
ity of ﬁnding close and strongly interacting islands thus
rapidly increases with impurity concentration.

As a ﬁrst step, we compare our measurements to nu-
merical calculations [24] based on the full parent spin
ladder Hamiltonian [17], depleted with randomly placed
non-magnetic sites (Fig. 1b). Following Ref. [26], we cal-
culate the susceptibility and magnetization with Quan-
tum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations of ladder systems
with L = 500 rungs, N = 2Lz randomly placed non-
magnetic sites and averaged over 300 random impurity

Mutual spin-island interactions are mediated by
the spin correlations in the hosting ladder medium. Since
the latter are short-ranged, eﬀective interactions expo-
nentially decay with distance. In addition, due to their
antiferromagnetic nature, J eﬀ (L) are ferro- or antiferro-
magnetic, depending on whether the mutual interaction
path contains an odd or even number of sites [3, 26],
reminiscent of the oscillatory Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-
Yosida (RKKY) interaction [28]. Being fully controlled
by the spin ladder medium, the eﬀective interactions can
be numerically obtained from a system with two non-
magnetic sites at distance L in a long ladder system.
Following Refs. [3, 26] we have performed Matrix Prod-
uct State calculations [27, 29] and conﬁrmed that J eﬀ (L)
is described by the simple law

J eﬀ (L) = J0(−1)Lx+Ly+1e−|Lx|/ξ

(2)

with the energy scale J0 = 0.441 meV and the de-
cay length ξ = 6.28 for the exchange constants of
DIMPY [24]. By including the numerically calculated
eﬀective interactions, Eq. (4) becomes a parameter-free
description of the emergent spin island system.

The magnetization and susceptibility of the eﬀective
model were determined [24] by exactly diagonalizing
(ED) the Hamiltonian in Eq. (4), for a system of N = 12
sites SI, randomly placed on a ladder with L = N/2z
rungs and with the eﬀective interactions given by Eq. (2).
The magnetization, averaged over 5000 random conﬁg-
urations, is in excellent agreement with measured data
(Fig.
2b). Notably, a model described by not more
than 12 mutually interacting spin operators is suﬃcient
to model the entire thermodynamic response of this com-
plex disordered many-body quantum system. Neverthe-
less, the description in terms of Eq. (4) remains valid
only as long as the mutual interactions controlled by the
spin island correlations do not change. While the lat-
ter remain unaﬀected by temperature and applied ﬁeld
as long as the spin ladder remains in its quantum disor-
dered regime, they fundamentally change once the system
crosses the critical ﬁeld Hc (cid:39) 2.7 T [17] to the quantum
critical Tomonaga-Luttinger spin liquid (TLSL) state.
Above Hc the eﬀective description naturally fails.

So far, we have successfully described the measured
thermodynamic properties in terms of an eﬀective model
of emergent spin island. However, can such objects and
their interactions be observed directly? To answer this
question, we present a series of high-resolution inelas-
tic neutron scattering experiments enabling to access
the spectral properties of both the spin ladder medium
and the low-energy spin island system. In Fig. 3a,c, we
show the background-subtracted magnetic neutron spec-
trum of (C7D10N)2Cu0.96Zn0.04Br4, as measured with
the neutron time-of-ﬂight (TOF) technique (LET spec-
trometer [30], ISIS facility, U.K.). Data was gathered
in distinct low- and high-resolution setups with incident

energies Ei = 4.2 meV and 2.2 meV (T = 75 mK). Neu-
tron intensity is shown as a function of energy transfer
ω and momentum transfer Q(cid:107) = Q · a along the leg di-
rection. Corresponding data from the parent compound
is shown in Figs. 3b,d, measured under identical experi-
mental conditions [19] and treated in the same way.

First, we observe that the properties of the spin ladder
medium hosting the spin island system remains nearly
unaﬀected by the presence of impurities (Fig.
3a,b).
In both the parent and disordered compound, identical
gapped and dispersive magnon and two-magnon bound
state branches [17] are observed.
In contrast, clear
changes are found in the low-energy sector (Fig. 3c,d).
The magnon gap is slightly shifted from ∆ = 0.33 to
0.41 meV, reminiscent of the magnon blue-shift observed
in 1D quantum-disordered AFs at ﬁnite temperature [31].
However, as a main feature, we observe a stripe of en-
hanced in-gap intensity developing around Q(cid:107) = 0.5 r.l.u.
in the disordered compound. This contribution origi-
nates in strongly interacting spin islands, leading to a

the momentum transfer along the rung [35]. We com-
pared F|(Q(cid:107), Q⊥)|2, averaged over Q⊥, to our experi-
mental data and by convolution with experimental res-
olution, we were able to quantify the real space decay
length to be ξ = 5.0(2). The magnetization proﬁle thus
decays to 10% of its initial value only after 15 unit cells
and the size of an emergent spin island is of the order of
20 nm. Notably, the determined decay length is slightly
shorter than the numerically calculated value of ξ = 6.27
[24]. However, this is not surprising since in-gap states
observed in experiments are located at a comparatively
large energy transfer on the order of 0.1 meV and thus
mainly originate from dimers or clusters of spin islands
close to each other.
Inﬂuenced by the nearby spin is-
lands, the magnetization proﬁle thus deviates from the
one of an isolated spin island.

In conclusion, by combining thermodynamic and high-
resolution inelastic neutron scattering techniques with
numerical simulations, we were able to quantitatively
study the properties of a system of strongly interact-
ing spin islands formed in a strong-leg Heisenberg spin
ladder depleted with non-magnetic impurities. An eﬀec-
tive description in the language of these objects explains
and quantitatively reproduces the measured data. As
long as the spin-ladder medium remains quantum dis-
ordered at H < Hc, this eﬀective description is faith-
ful and, in principle, would allow not only to describe
the thermodynamic response but even to access dynam-
ical quantities such as time-dependent correlation func-
tions [36]. Beyond Hc, however, the eﬀective descrip-
tion breaks down due to the quantum phase transition to
the TLSL state [37], rendering the spin-ladder correlation
functions fundamentally diﬀerent. To the authors knowl-
edge, the problem of non-magnetic impurities and the
fate of spin islands in the TLSL phase of a spin ladder or
their inﬂuence on the magnetically ordered state [17, 38]
has not been addressed experimentally or theoretically.
We hope that our study stimulates further eﬀorts and ex-
periments towards understanding the impurity-induced
physics in such systems.

disorder-induced ﬁnite density of states inside the gap.

It is even more pronounced in the spectrum presented
in Fig. 4a, measured with a lower incident energy of
Ei = 1.3 meV and thus better resolution (IN5 instru-
ment [32], ILL, France). The spin island contribution
progressively increases with decreasing energy ω, as
shown in Fig. 4b. This is readily explained since at
z = 0.04, the probability of ﬁnding spin islands only
weakly interacting with others remains large and there
is a vast number of quantum states at low energies.

As a main characteristics, these in-gap contributions
exhibit an intrinsic Q(cid:107) linewidth, as shown in Fig. 4c.
This intrinsic linewidth is a measure of the spin island
real-space magnetization proﬁle. Similar to conventional
magnetic neutron scattering [33], where intensity is mod-
ulated by the magnetic form factor (the Fourier trans-
form of the magnetic ions’ unpaired electron density),
scattering by spin islands is modulated by the square
of the spin island form factor F (Q(cid:107), Q⊥) — the Fourier
transform of its real space shape. A similar reasoning was
applied to determine the spatial shape of emergent local
objects in the substantially diﬀerent cases of the charge-
doped or depleted Haldane spin chains Y2−zCazBaNiO5
[34], Y2BaNi1−zMgzO5 [4]. For a spin island with expo-
nentially decaying staggered magnetization on a ladder,
the form factor reads as

F (Q(cid:107), Q⊥) =

(1 − e−i2πQ⊥) sinh(ξ−1)
cos(2πQ(cid:107)) + cosh(ξ−1)

(A) EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

Measurement details

Single crystals of (C7H10N)2Cu1−zZnzBr4 were grown
from solution by the temperature gradient method [1], ac-
cording to the same procedure as for the original material
(C7H10N)2CuBr4 [2] but with replacement of the relevant
amount z of CuBr2 by ZnBr2. For the magnetic mea-
surements single crystals with typical masses of 15 mg
were used. The measurements were carried out with the
help of a standard Quantum Design Magnetic Properties
Measurement System (MPMS-XL SQUID magnetome-
ter). For measurements below 1.7 K, the 3He cryostat
insert for MPMS (iQuantum iHelium3) was employed.
For all the samples, the magnetic ﬁeld was applied along
the a axis of the structure.

tering, all the hydrogen-containing chemicals were re-

(C7D10N)2Cu0.96Zn0.04Br4 with typical masses of 800 mg
each. They were ﬁxed on a similar aluminum sample

with the b direction being vertical.

Spin island scattering in reciprocal space

Hereby, we would like to provide an additional ﬁgure,
showing the part of reciprocal space accessed in the IN5
neutron experiment as well as the 1D spin island scatter-
ing.

Data in Fig. 1 (measured with the IN5 instrument [8],
with Ei = 1.3 meV and T = 75 mK) was integrated
along the out-of-plane direction −1 r.l.u. ≤ Qk ≤ 1 r.l.u.
and in the energy range 0.1 meV ≤ ω ≤ 0.3 meV. The
spin island scattering is readily observed as a stripe of
intensity, located at Q|| = 0.5 r.l.u..

FIG. 1. Neutron intensity of (C7D10N)2Cu1−zZnzBr4 with
z = 0.04, as measured with Ei = 1.3 meV and T = 75 mK.
Uncorrected data is shown as a function of Q|| (along the lad-
der leg) and the perpendicular in-plane direction. Data was
integrated in the out-of-plane direction Qk (−1 r.l.u. ≤ Qk ≤
1 r.l.u.) and in the energy range 0.1 meV ≤ ω ≤ 0.3 meV.

Magnetization proﬁle

The shape of the emergent magnetization proﬁle
around an impurity was studied by placing a single S = 0
site in the center of a ladder with 2 × 150 spins and by
calculating the local magnetization (cid:104)Sz
i (cid:105) of the ground
state with MS = 1/2. Fig. 2 illustrates the obtained lo-
i (cid:105) using the Density Matrix Renor-
cal magnetization (cid:104)Sz
malization Group (DMRG) algorithm from the ALPS li-
braries [11] (J|| = 1.42 meV and J⊥ = 0.82 meV, 350
DMRG states kept). The local magnetization follows an
exponential law without further corrections as expected
[9, 10]. By ﬁtting log |(cid:104)Sz
i (cid:105)| with a linear function, the ex-
ponential decay length was determined to be ξ = 6.27(1).
The spin island form factor F (Q||, Q⊥) is obtained by

Eﬀective interactions

If two impurities are introduced, two spin islands
emerge, represented by eﬀective spins SI at the impu-
rity sites, with SI = 1/2 [10]. Their interaction depends
on the distance along the leg (Lx) and rung (Ly) and due
to their eﬀective interaction, they pair up to a dimer with
a S = 0 singlet and a S = 1 triplet state at energies well
below the gap energy of the ladder system [9, 10]. De-
pending on whether Lx + Ly is odd or even, the eﬀective
interaction is ferro- or antiferromagnetic (FM or AFM).
The mutual eﬀective interactions were determined based
on Matrix Product State (MPS) [12] calculations of lad-
der systems with 2 × 150 sites and two non-magnetic
impurities placed at a predeﬁned distance Lx along the
leg and either in ’cis’ or ’trans’ conﬁguration (impurities
on the same leg or diﬀerent legs [9]). The two impurities
were centered around the middle of the ladder. In order
to minimize boundary eﬀects, the distance to the ladder
ends is larger than 4-5 correlation lengths. Following the
approach described in Refs. [9, 10], the two lowest ener-
gies in the symmetry sectors with total spin projection
of MS = 0 and MS = 1 were calculated. If spin-island
interactions are AFM, the lowest state corresponds to a
singlet (S = 0, MS = 0) while the ﬁrst excited state is
a triplet (S = 1, MS = 0,±1) and vice versa for FM in-
teractions. The energy diﬀerence between the lowest two
states in the MS = 0 sector thus corresponds to J eﬀ (L)
while the sign is determined from the lowest energy state
of the MS = 1 sector, as discussed in Refs. [9, 10].

Calculations were performed with the matrix MPS al-
gorithm from the ALPS package [12] (250 states kept).
As an independent check-up, the results published in ta-
ble II of Ref. [9] were successfully reproduced ﬁrst.
In
the latter, a similar numerical study was performed for
the Jleg/Jrung = 1 coupling case, close to the DIMPY

FIG. 3. Eﬀective interactions J eﬀ (L) obtained based on
DMRG calculations of two non-magnetic sites placed in the
center of a spin ladder with a mutual distance L = (Lx, Ly),
as described in the text. Red and blue symbols correspond to
non-magnetic sites at the same or diﬀerent legs (with Ly = 0
and |Ly| = 1 respectively).

The determined eﬀective interactions are shown in

Fig. 3. As previously noted in Refs. [9, 10], they follow

J eﬀ (L) = J0 (−1)Lx+Ly+1 e−|Lx|/ξ

where Lx ∈ Z and Ly ∈ {0, 1}. The parameters J0
and ξ were determined to be J0 = 0.441(7) meV and
ξ = 6.28(3) unit cells for the DIMPY coupling case, in
agreement with the trend shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 5 of
Ref. [10].

Thermodynamics: QMC calculations

Since the original Heisenberg spin ladder Hamiltonian
is non-frustrated, the thermodynamic properties are ac-
cessible with numerical Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)
calculations. The temperature-dependent susceptibility
χ(T ) and the magnetization M (T, H) were calculated us-
ing the QMC algorithms provided by the ALPS package
[11]. Calculations were performed for J|| = 1.42 meV and
J⊥ = 0.82 meV, on depleted ladders with 2× 500 = 1000
sites and a ﬁxed number N = z· 1000 of randomly placed
non-magnetic sites. Similar to Ref. [10], all thermody-
namic quantities were averaged over 300 random conﬁg-
urations (total computation time: 2 months, parallelized
to 32-64 cores on the Brutus Cluster at ETH Z¨urich).
The susceptibility was calculated using the ’loop’ algo-
rithm, for 0.5 K ≤ T ≤ 300 K (Fig. 4, coloured sym-
bols in upper panel). The ﬁeld-dependent magnetiza-
tion was calculated as a function of magnetic ﬁeld, for
0 T ≤ H ≤ 8 T, for T = 0.6 K (Fig. 4, coloured symbols
in lower panel). For the latter, the Stochastic Series Ex-

Interactions J eﬀ (L) depend on the distances L =
(Lx, Ly), as determined in the ’Eﬀective interactions’
subsection.

A small number of eﬀective spins SI was randomly
placed on N non-equal positions of a ladder with L =
N/2z rungs. From this random arrangement, the mutual
distances L = I − J and the corresponding interactions
J eﬀ (L) were determined. Before setting up the Hamilto-
nian, two special cases were considered (Fig. 5).
First, impurities on adjacent rungs in trans position
(|Lx| = 1 and |Ly| = 1) split the system into two non-
interacting segments, releasing a spin island on both
sides. Second, impurities on the same rung (Lx = 0

cent rungs in trans position lead to fragmentation and release

and |Ly| = 1) cut the ladder into to non-interacting frag-
ments as well. However, in contrast, the latter release
no additional spin island. Based on these requirements,
the Hamiltonian was set up according to Eq. (4) and
by exactly diagonalizing (ED) the latter, both eigenval-
ues Eµ with spin projection quantum number MS,µ and
eigenvectors Vµ were obtained. From the former, ther-
modynamic quantities such as the magnetization and the

The results were averaged over many repetitions R of ran-
domly chosen conﬁgurations of N impurities on a ladder
with L = N/2z rungs.

The susceptibility and ﬁeld-dependent magnetization
(T = 0.6 K) are shown in Fig. 4 as black lines, for diﬀer-
ent z. Calculations were performed for a ﬁxed number
of N = 12 impurities randomly placed on ladders with
1200, 600, 400, 300, 240 and 200 sites for z = 0.01, 0.02,
0.03, 0.04, 0.05 and 0.06 respectively. The result was
averaged over R = 5000 random conﬁgurations. By per-
forming calculations for diﬀerent number of impurities
2 ≤ N ≤ 12, we estimate that despite the small num-
ber of impurities, the mean deviation of the thermody-
namic quantities from the large-N limit is less than 2%
for z = 0.06 and even less for z < 0.06. Calculations
according to the eﬀective model are similar to the ones
published in Ref. [10] for the general J|| = J⊥ case (with
N = 10 eﬀective spins and R = 1000 repetitions), except
for the additional special cases considered in this study
(Fig. 5). Notably and within the range of applicability,
the agreement between the ED calculations according to
the eﬀective model and the QMC calculation of the full
depleted ladder Hamiltonian is excellent, for all concen-
trations considered and both for the susceptibility and
magnetization.

We note that the ED treatment of the eﬀective model
provides access to the eigenvectors Vµ as well, thus en-
abling to calculate dynamical properties such as local cor-
relations S(ω), measurable with inelastic neutron scatter-
ing [36].

Comparison to free spin model

Finally, it is instructive to compare the QMC and ED
numerical results in Fig. 4 to the simpliﬁed model based
on the naive assumption that each non-magnetic ion is
accompanied by a spin island and that the latter are non
interacting, thus leading to a Brillouin response (gray
lines in Fig. 4)

At very low concentration, this model becomes a faithful
description since spin islands are well separated on av-
erage (mean distance Lx (cid:29) ξ) and thus non-interacting.
However, at z (cid:38) 0.02, the free spin model becomes in-
appropriate in two ways. First,
interactions between
mutual spin islands become progressively more impor-
tant and deviations from the Brillouin response appar-
ent. Second, the probability of impurities occupying the
same rung increases as well. In the latter case (Fig. 5b),
no spin island is created at all. The probability that, in a
system with impurity concentration z, an impurity shares
a rung with another impurity is p = z/2 [10]. Since two
impurities are needed to form such a non-magnetic rung
pair and since both do not release a spin island, the satu-
rated magnetic moment of the eﬀective model is z(1− z)
instead of z as in Eq. (7).
