Abstract

In this paper, by solving the Friedman and thermodynamic pressure equations simultaneously,

we investigate the relation between the Friedman and thermodynamic pressure equations. Our

investigation shows that a prefect ﬂuid, as a suitable solution for the Friedman equations, cannot

simultaneously satisfy the thermodynamic pressure equation and Friedman equations. Moreover,

we consider various common energy deﬁnitions, such as the Komar mass, and try to simultaneously

solve the Friedman and thermodynamic pressure equations for various ﬂuids. Our investigation

shows that the Komar mass leads to a solution which may unify the primary inﬂationary and the

current accelerating eras into one model. Thereinafter, we consider a general form for the energy

of cosmic ﬂuid and combine it with the Friedman and thermodynamic pressure equations to get

some new solutions. The cosmological consequences of found solutions are also addressed.

In

addition, by taking into account a cosmic ﬂuid with the known equation of state, and combining

it with the Friedman and thermodynamic pressure equations, we get the corresponding energy of

these cosmic ﬂuids and their limitations in the cosmological setup. Therefore, our investigation

shows that the thermodynamic pressure equation applies serious constraints on the solutions of

the Friedman equations, their corresponding energy and thus the energy deﬁnitions. Moreover, we

see that the various energy deﬁnitions, whenever combined with the Friedman and thermodynamic

pressure equations, may give us a motivation for some cosmic ﬂuid models.

INTRODUCTION

The homogeneity and isotropy of cosmos in scales larger than 100-Mpc motivates us to

use FLRW metric and an energy-momentum source in the T µ

ν = diag(ρ, p, p, p) form, where

ρ and p are the energy density and momentum of the source, respectively, for describing the

spacetime geometry [1]. p = ωρ is a simple solution, used to describe the universe expansion

eras, in which ω is called the state parameter, and ω = 1

dominated eras, respectively [1]. Moreover, a ﬂuid with ω < − 2

3 , 0 denotes the radiation and matter
3 and ω = −1 are needed for
describing the current and primary inﬂationary phases of the universe, respectively [1, 2].

It was also recently shown that a prefect ﬂuid model of current accelerating phase cannot

satisfy the thermodynamics stability conditions [3]. We should note here that, although a

prefect ﬂuid with ω < − 2

3 cannot satisfy the thermodynamic stability conditions [2, 3], but
the whole system, including the geometry and cosmic ﬂuid ﬁlled the background, meets the

stability conditions [2, 4–6]. The latter is due to the horizon part of total entropy which

controls the behavior of total entropy in the long run limit (the current phase of universe)

[2, 4–6].

In addition, some authors use some type of ﬂuids with the equation of state p = p(ρ),

which diﬀers from the prefect ﬂuid model, to describe the universe dynamics [7–21]. Such

equation of state can be generated from the quantum eﬀects near the future singularities

[7–10] and also the so-called bag models of the hadron production from the quarks-gluons

coagulation [19–22]. It is also shown that ﬂuids with two free parameters, obeying the van

der Waals equation of state or p = kργ, where K and γ are constant, may satisfy the

thermodynamics stability conditions [23–26]. Because the FLRW universe is a spherically

symmetric spacetime, it seems that the Misner-Sharp mass is a proper deﬁnition for the total

energy conﬁned by the FLRW apparent horizon [27–34]. Moreover, one can also combine

the Komar mass deﬁnition with the ﬁrst and second laws of thermodynamics as well as the

holographic principle to get the Einstein and thus Friedman equations and their various

modiﬁcations [36–41].

In fact, there are many other mass deﬁnitions used to investigate

cosmic ﬂuids [1, 42].

Friedman equations relate the energy density and pressure of cosmic ﬂuid to the spacetime

parameters. These equations do not say anything about the source nature and in fact, they

only tell how the source parameters, including its energy density and pressure, should be

2

behaved. Therefore, one may assume a special ﬂuid, such as the prefect ﬂuid, and solve

the equations to get the source parameters as the functions of the spacetime parameters,

such as the Hubble parameter [1]. In addition, it seems that the apparent horizon of FLRW

metric plays the role of causal boundary for this spacetime, and thus may be considered as a

proper boundary for investigating the system thermodynamics [28–30]. In fact, one can show

that the uniﬁed ﬁrst law of thermodynamics is available on this surface, a result which is

parallel to the availability of the Friedman equations [28–34]. Moreover, taking into account

this horizon as a boundary for the system, it is shown that the thermodynamic stability

conditions [43] of closed systems are met by the system including the universe and ﬁelds

ﬁlled it [2, 4–6]. If we look at the cosmos as an equilibrium thermodynamical system, at

least in the time scale of human life, then we should consider a thermodynamic equilibrium

pressure for the cosmic ﬂuid.

It means that a true solution for the Friedman equations

should also satisfy the thermodynamic pressure equation which is indeed a thermodynamic

equation of state [43]. Because the thermodynamic pressure is deﬁned as the derivative of

energy with respect to the system volume [43], we need the cosmic ﬂuid energy relation

to investigate the relation between the thermodynamic pressure and Friedman equations.

Brieﬂy, we think a suitable model for cosmic ﬂuid should simultaneously satisfy both the

Friedman and thermodynamic pressure equations. Searching for such solutions may also

help us to get close to a more proper deﬁnition for the energy of cosmic ﬂuid.

Our aim in this paper is investigating the relation between the Friedman equations,

the thermodynamic pressure and various energy deﬁnitions. In fact, we are going to ﬁnd

some solutions for the Friedman equations which simultaneously satisfy the thermodynamic

pressure deﬁnition. In order to do it, in one hand, taking the various energy deﬁnitions of

cosmic ﬂuid in hand, we use the thermodynamic pressure equation to get the corresponding

pressure, and compare the result with the results of solving the Friedman equations.

In

addition, by considering a general form for energy, and combining it with the thermodynamic

pressure equation as well as the Friedman equations, we ﬁnd some new solutions. In other

hand, by focusing on the situation in which the equation of state is known, we try to ﬁnd

new solutions for the Friedman equations which can satisfy both the Friedman equations

and the thermodynamic pressure equation. This may help us ﬁnd the corresponding energy

of this solution in the FLRW background. We also use some observation data to study the

cosmological consequences of the found solutions.

3

We organize the paper as follows. In the next section, bearing the various energy deﬁni-

tions in mind, we show that a prefect ﬂuid model cannot simultaneously satisfy both of the

Friedman and thermodynamic pressure equations, which motivates us to use other ﬂuids

and energy deﬁnitions for modeling the cosmic ﬂuid. In fact, this section helps us in more

clearing our propose and motivation to present this work. In the section III, we are taking

into account some energy deﬁnitions and combine them with the thermodynamic pressure

and Friedman equations to get consistent solutions for the cosmic ﬂuid. In fact, our recipe,

in this section, may help us to provide a thermodynamic motivation for some type of cos-

mic ﬂuids. In section IV, we focus on the ﬂuids with known equation of state, and try to

solve simultaneously the Friedman and thermodynamic pressure equations to obtain some

properties of the energy-momentum source such as its energy and pressure. Throughout the

paper, the cosmological consequences of the found solutions are also addressed. Section V

is dedicated to a summary and concluding remarks.

II. PREFECT FLUID MODEL CANNOT SIMULTANEOUSLY SATISFY THER-

MODYNAMICS AND COSMOLOGY

The metric of the FLRW universe with scale factor a(t) is written as

ds2 = −dt2 + a2 (t)(cid:20) dr2

1 − κr2 + r2dΩ2(cid:21) ,

(1)

in which κ = −1, 0, 1, called the curvature constant, points to the open, ﬂat and closed

universes, respectively [1]. Apparent horizon of this spacetime, a proper causal boundary

for thermodynamic investigations, as the marginally trapped surface is evaluated by

∂µξ∂µξ = 0 → rA,

where ξ = a(t)r, which ﬁnally leads to

˜rA = a(t)rA =

1

qH 2 + κ

a(t)2

,

(2)

(3)

for the physical radii of apparent horizon (˜rA) [28–30, 32, 33]. Since WMAP data conﬁrms
a ﬂat universe, we focus on the κ = 0 case, and therefore, V = 4π

FLRW universe conﬁned by the apparent horizon located at ˜rA = 1

3H 3 is the volume of the ﬂat
H . The Friedman ﬁrst

equation and the continuity equation are

and

H 2 =

ρ,

˙ρ + 3H(ρ + p) = 0,

(4)

(5)

respectively. In this equations, ρ and p denote the energy density and pressure of a homoge-

nous and isotropic source supporting the FLRW geometry, respectively. If we use V = 4π
3H 3

to rewrite Eq. (4), we get

ρ(V ) =

1
2

(

4π

3 V − 2

)

(6)

in the ﬂat FLRW universe. One can combine Eqs. (4) and (5) with each other to get the

Friedman second equation as

3H 2 + 2 ˙H = −8πp.

(7)

Therefore, a solution for ρ and p which satisﬁes Eqs. (4) and (5) simultaneously, also meets

Eq. (7). These equations can also be combined with each other to yield the Raychaudhuri

equation

˙H = −4π(ρ + p).

(8)

A prefect ﬂuid with p = ωρ, where ω called the state parameter and is a constant parameter,

is a simple solution for the above equations leading to good agreement with observations

data [1]. Moreover, for metric (1), since it is a spherically symmetric metric, the Misner-

Sharp mass [27] leads to EM S = 1

2H = ρV and it is used in various papers for getting the
Friedman equations from thermodynamics arguments [31, 34, 35]. In fact, the EM S = ρV

equality is only valid in the ﬂat FLRW universe, governed by the Friedman equations, which

means Eq. (6) is available. In thermodynamics, pressure is deﬁned as

p = −(

∂E
∂V

)S,

(9)

where E and S are the energy and entropy of energy-momentum source, respectively. Now,

for the ﬂat universe with V = 4π

3H 3 , by using Eq. (4) and the Misner-Sharp mass to compute

pressure from Eq. (9), we get

p = −

3

ρ,

(10)

independently of the energy-momentum source nature. It is apparent that this result is in

direct conﬂict with the universe expansion history, for example, the radiation dominated

era. Now, since some authors show that the Komar mass (E = (ρ + 3p)V ) is in agreement

with the Friedman and continuity equations as well as the thermodynamics laws [36–40], we

may consider it as a true mass deﬁnition in the cosmological setups. By following the above

recipe for the Komar mass and a prefect ﬂuid with constant ω, we see that only a prefect

ﬂuid with ω = − 1

if we use the (ρ + p)V deﬁnition of energy [1], we get a prefect ﬂuid with ω = − 1

6 meets all of the above equations, which seems unsatisfactory. Moreover,
4 which is
again in conﬂict with the universe history. Now, if we deﬁne E = (βρ + ζp)V and follow
the above recipe for a prefect ﬂuid with constant state parameter, we reach the ω = − β
ζ+3
relation for the state parameter. In addition, since p = ωρ, we get E = (β + ζω)ρV which

ﬁnally leads to E = −3ωρV . As it is obvious, a prefect ﬂuid with a positive constant state

parameter, such as radiation, cannot lead to solutions with positive energy in the universe

whole history, a result which looks unsatisfactory. Indeed, the latter result tells us that since

E is a positive quantity, ω should meet the ω ≤ 0 condition, a result which may be in line

with the current accelerating universe [1], but it is in direct conﬂict with the radiation and

matter dominated eras as well as the thermodynamics stability conditions [3]. Therefore,

although a prefect ﬂuid with p = ωρ helps us in describing the universe expansion in an

appropriate manner but, it cannot satisfy the Friedman, continuity and thermodynamic

pressure equations as well as the E > 0 condition simultaneously. Indeed, one may conclude

that there is an intrinsic inconsistency in the mutual relation between thermodynamics,

Friedman equations and thus the universe history, if one takes into account the prefect ﬂuid

concept, as the dominant prefect ﬂuid, and the mentioned energy deﬁnitions for modeling

the universe dynamics. We think this inconsistency motivates us to ﬁnd and use another

energy deﬁnitions and cosmic ﬂuids which can always meet the Friedman, continuity and

the thermodynamic pressure equations simultaneously.

III. FROM ENERGY DEFINITION, FRIEDMAN AND THERMODYNAMIC

EQUATIONS TO THE COSMIC FLUID

Here, we combine the energy deﬁnitions with the Friedman and thermodynamic pressure

equations to get a model for the cosmic ﬂuid.

where c0 is a constant evaluated from the other parts of physics. It is a nice result because

it may cover a modiﬁed Polytropic model with the Polytropic index n = 1 [11], and also a

modiﬁed Chaplygin model with the Chaplygin parameter α = −2 [15], which are used to

describe the nature of dominant ﬂuid in current phase of the universe expansion. It is also

interesting to note here that, as a check, the result of a prefect ﬂuid with ω = − 1

6 , obtained
in previous section, is produced in the c0 → 0 limit. Inserting Eq. (12) into Eq. (5), leads to

ρ(a) = ρ01

(13)

where ρ01 is the integration constant, for energy density as a function of scale factor. There-

fore, E = (ρ + 3p)V is the energy content of a universe in which the energy-momentum

source satisﬁes Eqs. (12) and (13). We note here that authors in [11, 15], use the Misner-

Sharp deﬁnition to study their models, while we saw here that the Komar mass is a more

suitable deﬁnition of energy for these models. Finally, our work proposes whenever Komar

mass is combined with the thermodynamics, Friedman and continuity equations, it provides

a motivation for modeling the ﬂat FLRW universe by a source satisfying Eq. (12), which

is similar to a modiﬁed Polytropic gas with n = 1 and a modiﬁed Chaplygin model with

α = −2.

Cosmological consequences of the solution

Since q = −1 − ˙H

H 2 (deceleration parameter), by using Eqs. (4), (8) we get

q1 =

1
2

(

1
2

+ 3c0ρ),

7

(14)

for (12). Since a−1 = 1 + z, where z is redshift and we set the current value of scale factor

(a(t0)) to 1, one can use Eq. (13) to rewrite Eq. (14) as

q1 =

1
2

(

1
2

+ 15c0ρ01

(1 + z)

5
2

1 − 6c0(1 + z)

).

5
2

(15)

Here, for sake of simplicity, we only focus on the ρ01 = 1 case. It is interesting to note that,

in the z → ∞ limit, q1 → −1 which is in agreement with a de-Sitter universe and thus the

primary inﬂationary era. We should mention here that although q1 → −1 is in line with

the current universe, but since for the current universe z = 0, we cannot make compatible

the z → ∞ result with the current accelerating phase of universe. Additionally, q1 → −1 in

the z = 0 limit, for c0 → −∞. Therefore, a very small negative value should be attributed

to c0 to get the deceleration parameter of de-Sitter universe (q = −1) at z = 0. It is also

easy to check that c0 < 0 leads to positive density and negative pressure. Because some

observations indicate that for the current universe q ≈ −0.6 [1], we insert it into Eq. (15)

for z = 0 and get c0 = − 17

48 , which ﬁnally leads to

q1(z) =

1
4

(1 −

85(1 + z)

5
2

8 + 17(1 + z)

),

5
2

(16)

which is plotted in Fig (1). As it is obvious, this solution cannot cover the universe whole

history. It may be considered as a model for unifying both the primary inﬂationary era and

the current accelerating phase. In fact, if we introduce a source, satisfying Eq. (13), then

we may consider it as a supporter for the both primary inﬂationary and current accelerating
ρ and using Eqs. (12), (13) and the a−1 = 1 + z relation, we get

phases. If we deﬁne ω(z) = p

ω(z) = −

(

85(1 + z)

+ 1),

(17)

which goes to −1 and −0.733 in the z → ∞ and z → 0 limits, respectively, which are desired

results [1]. These result are more better displayed in Fig. (2), and are in accordance with

the nature of dominated ﬂuid in both the primary inﬂationary era and the current universe.

Cosmos includes a singularity in the future, if the cosmic ﬂuid satisﬁes one of the below

conditions [8, 10]:

Type I singularity: ρ, |p| → ∞ for t → tc and a → ∞,

Type II singularity: ρ → ρc and |p| → ∞, while t → tc and a → ac.

FIG. 1: The plot depicts q1(z) function.

FIG. 2: The plot depicts ω(z) function.

Type III singularity: ρ, |p| → ∞, for t → tc and a → ac,

Type III singularity: ρ, |p| → 0, for t → tc and a → ac,

where tc, ρc and ac 6= 0 are constant. It is easy to check that Eq. (13) avoids any future
singularity for c0 < 0, that means the c0 = − 17

48 case is free from singularity.

9

B. Another energy deﬁnition

Moreover, it is also argued that (ρ + p)V may play the role of energy in the cosmological

setups [1]. Using the above recipe to get

which ﬁnally leads to

p(ρ) = ρ(c2ρ2 −

),

(18)

(19)

where c2 is again the integration constant. It is similar to a modiﬁed polytropic and modiﬁed
Chaplygin gases with parameters n = 1

2 and α = −3, respectively [11, 15]. Therefore,
E = (ρ + p)V is the energy content of a universe in which the energy-momentum source

satisﬁes Eq. (19). It is also interesting to note here that, as a check, the result of a prefect

ﬂuid with ω = − 1

4 , obtained in the second section, is produced in the c2 → 0 limit. Inserting

this result into Eq. (5) to reach

ρ(a) = ρ02

−9
2

3a

1 − 4c2a

,

−9
2

(20)

where ρ02 is the integration constant. Finally, we saw that the combination of (ρ + p)V

deﬁnition of energy with the Friedman ﬁrst equation as well as the continuity and thermo-

dynamics equations gives us a motivation for modeling the ﬂat FLRW universe by either a

modiﬁed Polytropic gas with n = 1

2 or a modiﬁed Chaplygin with α = −3.

Cosmology corresponding to the solution

Following the above recipe to get

q2 =

1

(

+ 3c2ρ2),

for the deceleration parameter, which ﬁnally leads to

q2 =

(21)

(22)

Here, we conﬁne again ourselves to the ρ02 = 1 case. Applying the q(z ≃ 0.6) ≃ 0 condition
on Eq. (22) to get c2 ∼ −10−4 leading to

q2(z) =

1

converging to 0.125 in the z → ∞ limit, which is smaller than those of the matter ( 1
2)
and radiation (1) dominated eras. Additionally, the q ≃ 0.125 case can be modeled by a

prefect ﬂuid with ω ≃ −0.25. It is also easy to see that, because c2 is negative, the model is

free from any singularity and its density and pressure are positive and negative quantities,

respectively. Finally, it is easy to check that, in the z → 0 limit, q2 is positive, a result

which is indirect conﬂict with the current phase of the universe expansion [1, 44–46], as it

is obvious from Fig (3), and therefore, it is not a suitable solution for describing the whole

history of the universe. The latter means that the E = (ρ + p)V relation is not a proper

deﬁnition.

FIG. 3: The plot depicts q2(z) function.

C. A general proposal for energy and its consequences

Now, bearing the homogeneity and isotropy of universe in mind, we may write the energy

content of universe as E = βρV + ζpV which is in fact a generalization of the mentioned

energy deﬁnitions. It covers the Misner-Sharp in the ζ = 0 and β = 1 limits. Moreover,

it converges to the Komar mass by inserting the 1 and 3 values for β and ζ parameters,

respectively. Another interesting case is the β = −ζ = 1

2 case leading to E = W V , where
is the work density [31]. The latter case is interesting since it includes the work

W = ρ−p
2

density which plays the role of pressure in deriving the Friedman equations by applying the

11

uniﬁed ﬁrst law of thermodynamics on the various horizons of FLRW universe [28–35]. Now,

combining Eqs. (7) and (9) with each other to obtain

E = 3ρV +Z

˙H

(24)

By equating this result with E = βρV + ζpV , using Eqs. (6), (8) and taking derivative

Polytropic models with the Polytropic index n = 2

[11]. The Chaplygin and modiﬁed Chaplygin models with the Chaplygin parameter α = − 3γ ′
2
may also be obtained for A = 0 and A 6= 0, respectively [15]. It is worth mentioning here

that, for A = −1, the preceding equation of state converges to a model which was initially

introduced in [7] and studied in more details in [8–10]. More studies on the various properties

of this equation of state, such as its future singularities etc., can be found in [8–10, 19–21].

Therefore, our work may give us the energy content of their model and a thermodynamic

motivation for that. It is also useful to mention here that the quark bag model [22] permits

the same relation as Eq. (27) which leads to satisfying results in the cosmological set-ups

[19, 21], and therefore, our scheme can be considered as a thermodynamic motivations for

their claims and equations of state. In addition, our work gives us the energy content of a

universe ﬁlled by such component. It is also interesting to mention here that authors in [19]

consider a ﬂuid with pressure p = ρ(a − f (ρ)), while −1 < a, and study its cosmological

applications. They ﬁnd out that the f (ρ) ∼ ρµ case, while µ > 0, may lead to compatible

results with the universe history and its current phase [19]. Let us more compare our results

with those of Ref. [19]. Comparing their result (µ > 0) with Eq. (27), we get the γ ′ > 2
3
2 < ζ and thus 0 < β for ζ < 0 and β < 0 for 0 < ζ if we also consider

condition leading to − 3

12

the −1 < a condition which is parallel to the −1 < A case. Moreover, by comparing

Eq. (27) with [19], we get that B = A + 1, and it should be a negative quantity meaning

that c1 < 0. Therefore, by this scheme, we found the equation of state for the cosmic

ﬂuid with T µ

ν = diag(−ρ, p, p, p), ﬁlling the background, and its corresponding energy in a

compatible way with the thermodynamic pressure, Friedman, continuity, and Raychaudhuri

equations. Finally, we should mention that our investigation shows that models proposed

in [8–10, 19–21] satisfy the Friedman and thermodynamic equations simultaneously.

IV. FROM THE EQUATION OF STATE, FRIEDMAN EQUATION AND THER-

MODYNAMIC PRESSURE TO ENERGY

Consider a case in which the p(ρ) relation is available, such as the Polytropic and Chaply-

gin models. One can use Eq. (6) to get p(V ). In addition, by inserting the result into Eq. (9)

and using Eq. (4) one can obtain an expression for the energy as a function of ρ and V . As

an example, if we assume p = ωρ and combining Eqs. (4) and (9) with each other, we get

the E = −3ωρV relation for energy, as we have previously obtained in the second section,

while ω is constant. Therefore, solutions with ω ≤ 0 leads to positive energy, a result which

may be in line with the current accelerating universe, but it is in direct conﬂict with the

radiation and matter dominated eras as well as the thermodynamic stability conditions [3].

One can check to see that the ρ(a) and a(t) relations are the same as those of the standard

cosmology. It is also useful to note that authors in [3], considered the total mass deﬁnition

for energy (E = ρV ) and show that a dark energy ﬂuid satisfying p = ωρ, which has only

p = Kργ when K and γ are constant. We get E = [

one free parameter including ω, is unphysical. In addition, Following the above recipe for
32π )γ−1K(ρV )3−2γ for energy,
which, as a check, covers the p = ωρ case in the appropriate limit γ = 1 and K = ω. The

2γ−3 ]( 3

3

E > 0 condition also leads to γ > 3

2 for K < 0. It is useful to note
here that these solutions, which have two free parameters including K and γ, may satisfy

2 for K > 0 and γ < 3

the thermodynamic stability conditions [23–26].

Cosmological features of the solutions

Let us consider the general case p = Kργ and inserting it into Eq. (5) to get

ρ(a) = ρ0(a3(γ−1) − K)

1−γ ,

for density. By using Eq. (6), we reach

V. SUMMARY

In the standard cosmology, a prefect ﬂuid with p = ωρ and a constant equation of state

(ω), satisfying the Friedman and continuity equations simultaneously, can be used to model

the universe expansion. Our study shows that it is impossible to preserve the Friedman and

the thermodynamic pressure equations simultaneously, during the cosmos evolution, if one

takes into account the prefect ﬂuid concept. In addition, we have referred to the Komar

mass and found that if we combine it with the Friedman ﬁrst equation and insert the result

into the thermodynamic pressure equation, we get an equation of state which is similar to

the modiﬁed polytropic and modiﬁed chaplygin models. In continue, by using the continuity

equation, we reach at a relation for the density proﬁle of cosmic ﬂuid which is in agreement

with the primary inﬂationary and current phases of the universe expansion.

In fact, the

obtained density is free from singularity and it may unify the nature of dominated ﬂuid in

both the primary inﬂationary and current accelerating eras into one ﬂuid. Moreover, one

another energy deﬁnition was also studied in a parallel manner to the above recipe, and its

weaknesses were also addressed. In addition, we considered a special expression for energy

that covers previous deﬁnitions. By combining this energy deﬁnition with the pressure

thermodynamic deﬁnition and the Friedman second equation, we got the p(V ) relation.

Bearing the Friedman ﬁrst equation in mind, we could get the p(ρ) relation which has been

16

previously shown that this type of ﬂuids may be used to model the universe expansion [7–21].

Therefore, our study helps us in getting the corresponding energy of these models, in the

cosmological setup, in a parallel line with the thermodynamic pressure deﬁnition. Moreover,

our investigation may also be considered as the thermodynamic motivation for these models.

Thereinafter, we focused on the situation in which the p(ρ) relation is valid. By combining

the equation of state with the Friedman ﬁrst equation and inserting the result into the

pressure thermodynamic deﬁnition, we could get a relation for the energy. Our study shows

that this recipe does not lead to a suitable result for the prefect ﬂuid (p = ωρ) case. In

addition, we saw that the p = Kργ case, where K is constant, leads to a solution which may

be free from any future singularity and also govern the universe expansion during the time

that its deceleration parameter meets the q < 1

2 condition. Finally, our investigation shows
that the thermodynamic pressure equation, as a thermodynamic equation of state, imposes

serious constraints on the cosmic ﬂuid, as the solution of the Friedman equations and its

corresponding energy, and thus the energy deﬁnitions. Therefore, this is still an unanswered

question that what kind of ﬂuids with which energy deﬁnition can simultaneously obey

the Friedman and thermodynamics equations. We also think one may use the pressure

thermodynamic deﬁnition to get a relation for the energy of cosmic ﬂuid in the cosmological

setups.
