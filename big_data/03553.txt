Abstract

For a vector bundle E → X with X a smooth variety over a ﬁeld we prove a formula for the
proper pushforward π∗ : A∗P(E ) → A∗X, where π : P(E ) → X denotes the associated projective
bundle of lines in E . Our formula is relative in the sense that it depends on the rank of E while
being independent of the dimension of X. As applications, we apply the formula to compute
the pushforward to X of the Chern class of a ﬁbration Y → X, whose ﬁbers are degree d
projective hypersurfaces with d arbitrary, and then derive a ‘relative B´ezout-type formula’ for
the intersection of dim(P(E )) divisors in P(E ) in terms of invariants of X.

Introduction

Let X be a smooth variety over ﬁeld K endowed with a vector bundle E → X, and denote
by π : P(E ) → X the associated projective bundle of lines in E . A fundamental task in
the investigation of P(E ) is to relate its invariants to invariants of X, the prototypical
example of which being the formula for the Chow ring A∗P(E ) in terms of A∗X, namely

A∗P(E ) ∼= A∗X[ζ]/(cid:0)ζ r + c1(E )ζ r−1 + · · · + cr(E )(cid:1) ,

(1.1)

where ζ = c1(OP(E )(1)), r = rk(E ) and ci(E ) denotes the ith Chern class of E . Other
than its simplicity an attractive feature of formula (1.1) is that the RHS only depends on
the rank of E , thus being independent of the dimension of X.

In this note we consider the map

π∗ : A∗P(E ) → A∗X,

i.e., the proper pushforward of algebraic cycles modulo rational equivalence associated
with the bundle projection π, and derive a formula for π∗ which (in a similar vein) only
depends on the rank of E . Our motivation for such a formula comes primarily from the
fact that

π∗α ∀α ∈ A∗P(E ),

(1.2)

ZP(E )

α =ZX

so that invariants of P(E ) (and of its closed subschemes) captured by the Chow ring may
be expressed in terms of invariants of X, which are naturally much simpler. Note that the
integral sign in (1.2) denotes the proper pushforward associated with the corresponding
structure morphism to spec(K). To state our formula we ﬁrst introduce some notation.

Denote by L1, . . . , Lm the distinct non-trivial Chern roots of E and let ki be such that
the multiplicity of Li is ki + 1, so that

c(E ) = (1 + L1)k1+1 · · · (1 + Lm)km+1 ∈ A∗X.

We then consider the ring A∗X[x1, . . . , xm] where the xi are formal variables, and let D
be the operator on this ring given by

Now let α ∈ A∗P(E ) be arbitrary, which by formula (1.1) may be written as

α = α0 + α1ζ + α2ζ 2 + · · · ,

2

where αjζ j denotes π∗αj ·(cid:0)c1(OP(E )(1)) ∩ [P(E )](cid:1)j with αj ∈ A∗X. We then associate

with α the elements

gα(xi) =

α − (α0 + · · · + αn−1ζ n−1)

ζ n−m+1

∈ A∗X[x1, . . . , xm],

where n = rk(E ) − 1. Our formula is then given by the following expression, which will
be formally stated and proved as Theorem 2.1 below.

Theorem (Main Theorem). With notations as above, the map π∗ : A∗P(E ) → A∗X is

(1.3)

Clearly formula (1.3) is symmetric in the distinct Chern roots of E so that the end result
may be expressed in terms of the Chern classes ci(E ) and the αj for j ≥ n. The (non-
l=1, l6=i(xi − xl) appearing in the denominator of the formula are formal
expressions that end up cancelling before evaluation at the Li. When E is the direct sum
of tensor powers of a ﬁxed line bundle on X we recover the main formula derived in [5].

invertible) termsQm

For projective bundles of small rank, formula (1.3) is reasonable to apply by hand, though
in any case a computer implementation is straightforward and is of negligible cost. We
note that such an implementation may be of utility for software packages computing
the characteristics classes of varieties.
In particular an implementation of (1.3) allows
the applicability setting of algorithms for computing singular Chern classes and Euler
characteristics of (possibly singular) projective varieties and schemes (such as [9, 8]) to be
broadened to the setting of projective bundles. To this end, and to simplify computations
for the interested reader, we provide a test implementation in the form of a Macaulay2
[7] package which can be downloaded from https://github.com/Martin-Helmer/PBF.

For an explicit example of an application of the Main Theorem (proved as Theorem 2.1
below), let X be a smooth Fano variety over C,

E = OX ⊕ O(−2KX) ⊕ O(−3KX),

and let ι : Y ֒→ P(E ) be a smooth anti-canonical hypersurface in P(E ) given by the
Weierstraß equation

Y :(cid:0)y2 = x3 + f xz2 + gz3(cid:1) ⊂ P(E ),

where the coeﬃcients f and g are sections of O(−4KX) and O(−6KX) respectively. The
map ϕ = π ◦ ι then endows Y with the structure of an elliptic ﬁbration ϕ : Y → X.
Motivated by physical considerations, in [11] Sethi, Vafa and Witten derived a formula

3

for the Euler characteristic of Y in terms of the Chern classes of X for the case dim(X) = 3,
namely

12c1(X)c2(X) + 360c1(X)3.

(1.4)

χ(Y ) =ZX

We note that the above formula may be simpliﬁed further since we necessarily have
c1(X)c2(X) = 24 for X Fano. It immediately follows via Theorem 2.1 that formula (1.4)
is simply a manifestation of formula (1.2) for α = ι∗c(Y ), i.e.,

ZP(E )

ι∗c(Y ) =ZX

π∗ (ι∗c(Y )) ,

(1.5)

as the LHS of equation (1.5) coincides with χ(Y ) by the Gauß-Bonnet theorem, and

Theorem 2.1 immediately yields the RHS to be RX 12c1(X)c2(X) + 360c1(X)3.

More precisely, by the adjunction formula and standard exact sequences of vector bundles
we have

ι∗c(Y ) =

(1 + ζ)(1 + ζ − 2KX)(1 + ζ − 3KX)(3ζ − 6KX)

(1 + 3ζ − 6KX)

· π∗c(X),

where again ζ = c1(OP(E )(1)) ∩ [P(E )]. Thus

ϕ∗c(Y ) = π∗(ι∗c(Y ))

= π∗(cid:18)(1 + ζ)(1 + ζ − 2KX)(1 + ζ − 3KX)(3ζ − 6KX)

(1 + 3ζ − 6KX )

(cid:19) c(X),

where the second equality follows from the projection formula. We then take

α =

(1 + ζ)(1 + ζ − 2KX)(1 + ζ − 3KX)(3ζ − 6KX)

(1 + 3ζ − 6KX )

= α0 + α1ζ + · · · ∈ A∗P(E ),

where the αi are the Taylor coeﬃcients of α when expanded with respect to ζ. By
Theorem 2.1 we then have

π∗α =   α − (α0 + α1ζ)

ζ(−3KX + 2KX)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ζ=2KX! +  α − (α0 + α1ζ)

ζ(−2KX + 3KX)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ζ=3KX!

thus

1 − 6KX

ϕ∗c(Y ) =

12c1(X)

1 + 6c1(X)

c(X).

(1.6)

Such a formula is often referred to in the literature as a Sethi-Vafa-Witten formula (see
[5][1][4]). We note that one of the advantages of our methods is the dimension-independent

4

nature of Theorem 2.1, so that equation (1.6) is valid for X of any dimension. One may
then obtain an analogue of formula (1.4) for χ(Y ) with dim(X) arbitrary simply by
reading oﬀ the term of codimension dim(X) on the RHS of equation (1.6), namely

χ(Y ) =ZX

12c1(X)

dim(X)−1

Xi=0

ci(X) (−6c1(X))dim(X)−1−i .

In an analogous fashion one may use Theorem 2.1 to realize other invariants of closed
subschemes of a projective bundle P(E ) –such as intersection numbers, Chern numbers,
Hirzebruch genera, etc.– in terms of invariants of its base, which as noted earlier are often
much simpler. We devote §2 to the statement and proof of Theorem 2.1 which is the
Main Theorem given in the introduction above; in the remaining sections we derive some
applications of this theorem. In particular, we use Theorem 2.1 to derive a B´ezout-type
formula for the intersection of dim(P(E )) divisors in P(E ) in terms of the Chern classes of
E and T X, and we generalize formula (1.6) to the case where Y is a general hypersurface
in an arbitrary projective bundle P(E ) → X, so that Y is a general ﬁbration of projective
hypersurfaces.

Notation and conventions. The assumptions made at the outset of this section will
hold throughout the rest of the paper. In particular, we will work over an arbitrary ﬁeld K,
except in §3 where we assume that K is an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic zero.
We denote by X an arbitrary smooth K-variety, which will always come endowed with a
vector bundle E → X. We denote by π : P(E ) → X the associated projective bundle
of lines in E . The distinct non-trivial Chern roots of E will be denoted by L1, ..., Lm,
and ki ∈ Z will be such that the multiplicity of Li is ki + 1. We will always assume
m ≤ rk(E ) − 1, as P(E ) ∼= P(E ⊗ L ) for any line bundle L implies without loss of
generality that we can set one of the Chern roots of E equal to zero.

2 Proof of Main Theorem

Let α ∈ A∗P(E ) be arbitrary, which by the isomorphism

may be written as

A∗P(E ) ∼= A∗X[ζ]/(cid:0)ζ r + c1(E )ζ r−1 + · · · + cr(E )(cid:1)

α = α(ζ) = α0 + α1ζ + α2ζ 2 + · · · ,

where we recall αjζ j denotes π∗αj ·(cid:0)c1(OP(E )(1)) ∩ [P(E )](cid:1)j

. We now prove the following

Proof. As α ∈ A∗P(E ) may be written as

by the projection formula for intersection products we have

π∗αj · ζ j,

α =Xj=0

αj · π∗(ζ j),

π∗α =Xj=0

thus π∗α is completely determined by the π∗(ζ j). For this, we use the fact that by Fulton’s
deﬁnition of Chern class ([6], §3.2) we have

π∗(cid:0)1 + ζ + ζ 2 + · · ·(cid:1) = c(E )−1 =

1

(1 + L1)k1+1 · · · (1 + Lm)km+1

∈ A∗X,

(2.1)

where we recall that the Li are the distinct non-trivial Chern roots of E and the ki
are uniquely determined non-negative integers. As the proper pushforward of a pure
dimensional cycle (not in the kernel of π∗) preserves its dimension, it follows that π∗(ζ j)
coincides with the term of dimension dim(P(E )) − j in the formal series expansion of

(cid:0)(1 + L1)k1+1 · · · (1 + Lm)km+1(cid:1)−1 (so that π∗(ζ j) = 0 for j < rk(E ) − 1). Now since

Remark 2.1. It follows from formula (2.3) (along with degree considerations) that terms
of the form Lrank(E )−m
l=1, l6=i(Li −Ll) appearing in ﬁnal expression for π∗α in fact cancel
once put over a common denominator. As such, in practice one may in fact avoid the use
of the diﬀerential operator D by ﬁrst assuming all the non-trivial Chern roots are distinct,
and then evaluating the ﬁnal simpliﬁed rational expression at the possibly non-distinct
total number of non-trivial Chern roots of E .

3 Chern Class of a Fibration

We ﬁrst review the theory of Chern classes from a functorial perspective (for more details
one may consult [2][12]).
In this section we impose the constraint that K denotes an
algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic zero. For V a K-variety denote by K0(VarV ) the
free Z-module generated by isomorphism classes of proper morphisms to V , modulo the
relation

[Y

ϕ
→ V ] = [Z

ϕ|Z−→ V ] + [U

ϕ|U−→ V ],

whenever Z is a closed subvariety of Y with open complement U in Y . We may endow
K0(VarV ) with a ring structure by setting

[Y

ϕ
→ V ] · [W

ψ
→ V ] = [Y ×V W → V ],

where Y ×V W → V denotes the ﬁbered product of Y with W over V (with respect to the
morphisms ϕ and ψ). We refer to this ring K0(VarV ) as the relative Grothendieck ring
of varieties (over V ). When V = spec(K) the relative Grothendieck ring is often denoted
K0(VarK), and referred to simply as the Grothendieck ring of varieties. Moreover, we may
view K0(Var(·)) as a covariant functor from varieties to groups with respect to proper
morphisms.

For this, given a proper morphism V

f
→ S we deﬁne a homomorphism

given by

K0(f ) : K0(VarV ) −→ K0(VarS)

[Y → V ] 7→ [Y → V → S].

8

With these prescriptions it is straightforward to show that indeed K0(Var(·)) is a covariant
functor with respect to proper morphisms, which we refer to as the relative Grothendieck
functor.

Now denote by A∗ the Chow group functor, which takes a variety V to its group of
algebraic cycles modulo rational equivalence A∗V , and acts on proper morphisms via
proper pushforward of algebraic cycles. For V smooth the Chow group may be given a
ring structure via Fulton’s intersection products [6]. In such a case we will denote A∗V
by A∗V , which we refer to as the Chow ring of V (see [6], § 1.4.). For a proper morphism
f : V → S the associated pushforward is denoted f∗ : A∗V → A∗S. The Chow group
functor is also covariant with respect to proper morphisms, and there exists a unique
natural transformation

c∗ : K0(Var(·)) −→ A∗

such that if V is smooth then

c∗(V )([V id

→ V ]) = c(T V ) ∩ [V ] ∈ A∗V,

where c∗(V ) denotes the homomorphism c∗(V ) : K0(VarV ) → A∗V induced by the natural
transformation c∗, and c(T V ) ∩ [V ] denotes the total homological Chern class of V (again
see [2][12] for details). For V possibly singular the class c∗(V )([V id
→ V ]) will be denoted
by cSM(V ), which is referred to in the literature as the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson class
of V . It follows from functoriality that for a more general morphism ϕ : Y → V we have

c∗(V )([Y

ϕ
→ V ]) = ϕ∗cSM(Y ),

which from here on will be denoted by cSM(ϕ), and referred to as the Chern-Schwartz-
MacPherson class of the morphism ϕ. If Y and V are both smooth then we will simply
refer to cSM(ϕ) as the Chern class of ϕ, written c(ϕ), so that the usual Chern class of a
smooth variety may be referred to as the Chern class of the identity morphism.

From this perspective we may reformulate the Sethi-Vafa-Witten formula (1.6) from §1
as

c(ϕ) =

· c(idX) ∈ A∗X.

(3.1)

12c1(X)

1 + 6c1(X)

We now generalize this formula to the case where Y is an arbitrary smooth hypersurface
in a projective bundle, not necessarily an elliptic ﬁbration.

So let X be a smooth K-variety endowed with a vector bundle E → X (as in the Notation
and Conventions stated in §1). Assume Y is the smooth zero-scheme of a non-trivial
section of a line bundle M → P(E ), so that Y is an embedded smooth hypersurface in
P(E ). Denote by ι : Y ֒→ P(E ) the natural inclusion, so that ϕ = π ◦ι : Y → X endows Y
with the structure of a ﬁbration of degree d hypersurfaces in Prk(E )−1, where d is such that

9

[Y ] = dζ + π∗β with β a divisor in X, and ζ = c1(OP(E )(1)) ∩ [P(E )] ([Y ] is of this form by
Theorem 3.3 of [6]). We then associate with Y a rational expression QY in the distinct
non-trivial Chern roots Li of E and the class β ∈ A1(X). Note that the expression QY
will be seen to arise from the application of Theorem 2.1 to the current setting in proof
of Theorem 3.1 below.

To deﬁne QY , we ﬁrst consider the the following sum in the formal variables xj and β

n

Xi=1   (1 − xi)Qn

j=1(1 + xj − xi)

j=1, j6=i(xi − xj)

β − d · xi

1 + β − d · xi

j=1(1 + xj)
j=1, j6=i(xi − xj)

·

β

1 + β! ,

− Qn
xiQn

where n = rk(E )−1, which coincides with the total number of non-trivial Chern roots of E
by assumption. Then after putting the above sum over a common denominator, cancelling
j=1, j6=i(xi − xj)
(which one may in fact do as mentioned in Remark 2.1), and then evaluating the xi at
the n number of non-trivial Chern roots of E we arrive at an expression of the form

common factors from the numerator and denominator of the form xiQr

(1 + β) · (1 + β − dL1)k1+1 · · · (1 + β − dLm)km+1 ,

PY

where we recall ki + 1 is the multiplicity of Li, and PY is a polynomial in the non-trivial
Chern roots of E and β. We then take

QY =

(1 + β) · (1 + β − dL1)k1+1 · · · (1 + β − dLm)km+1 .

PY

For example if Y is the elliptic ﬁbration in Weierstrass form deﬁned in §1 we have

QY =

12c1(X)(1 − 3c1(X))

(1 + 6c1(X))(1 + 6c1(X) − 6c1(X))(1 − 3c1(X))

=

12c1(X)

1 + 6c1(X)

∈ A∗X.

We note that if E ∨
d denotes a vector bundle whose distinct non-trivial Chern roots are
−dL1, ..., −dLm, where −dLi has the same multiplicity as Li (i.e., ki + 1), then the de-
nominator of QY may be associated with the inverse Chern class of the vector bundle
E ∨
d ⊗ O(β), so that QY may be written as

QY = c(E ∨

d ⊗ O(β))−1 ∩ PY ∈ A∗X.

The Chern class of ϕ is then given by the following

Theorem 3.1. Let ϕ : Y → X be a ﬁbration of degree d projective hypersurfaces as
deﬁned above. Then

c(ϕ) = QY · c(idX) ∈ A∗X.

also in the next section for the proof of Theorem 4.1, namely

Lemma 3.2. Let R be a commutative ring with unity and let m ∈ N be a positive integer.

Proof of Theorem 3.1. By Remark 2.1 it suﬃces to prove the case where the non-trivial
Chern roots of E are all distinct, i.e., when m = n = rk(E ) − 1. So let O(Y ) → P(E )
denote the line bundle corresponding to the divisor class of Y (whose restriction to Y
yields the normal bundle to Y in P(E )). In order to write an explicit expression for c(ϕ),
we ﬁrst write an expression for c(ι), where we recall ι : Y → P(E ) is the natural inclusion.
For this, we consider the following exact sequences of vector bundles (as Chern classes
are multiplicative)

0 → T Y → ι∗T P(E ) → ι∗O(Y ) → 0
0 → TP(E )/X → T P(E ) → π∗T X → 0

0 → OP(E ) → π∗(E ) ⊗ OP(E )(1) → TP(E )/X → 0.

The ﬁrst sequence (from the top) is standard, the second one may take as the deﬁnition
of the relative tangent bundle TP(E )/X , and the third is lifted from B.5.8 in [6]. We then

11

have

c(ι) = ι∗ (c(T Y ) ∩ [Y ])

= ι∗(cid:18)c(ι∗T P(E ))

c(ι∗O(Y ))

∩ [Y ](cid:19)

∩ ι∗[Y ]

∩ (c1(O(Y )) ∩ π∗[X])

∩ (c(π∗T X) ∩ π∗[X])

∩ π∗c(idX ),

where the third equality follows from the projection formula, the fourth from the fact
that π∗[X] = [P(E )] (since ι∗[Y ] = c1(O(Y )) ∩ [P(E )]), the ﬁfth from the commutativity
of Chern classes, and the sixth by the behavior of Chern classes with respect to pullback.

Now since (1, L1, ..., Ln) are the Chern roots of E we have that the Chern roots of
π∗(E ) ⊗ OP(E )(1) are then (ζ, L1 + ζ, . . . , Ln + ζ), with ζ = c1(OP(E )(1)) ∩ [P(E )] (note that
technically, the Chern roots are of the form π∗Li + ζ but we have omitted the pullbacks;
we shall also slightly abuse notation and let 1 + Y denote 1 + c1(Y )). Thus

c(ι) =

(1 + ζ)(1 + ζ + L1) · · · (1 + ζ + Ln) · [Y ]

· π∗c(idX ),

so that

c(ϕ) = ϕ∗c(idY )

= π∗ ◦ ι∗c(idY )
= π∗c(ι)

= π∗(cid:18) (1 + ζ)(1 + ζ + L1) · · · (1 + ζ + Ln) · [Y ]

1 + Y

1 + Y

· π∗c(idX )(cid:19)
(cid:19) · c(idX ),

where the second equality follows from functoriality and the ﬁfth follows via the projection
formula. The theorem then follows once we show

4 A B´ezout Formula

An immediate corollary of Theorem 2.1 yields a formula for the intersection of dim(P(E ))
divisors in P(E ) in terms of invariants of its base X, which we think of as a ‘relative B´ezout-
type formula’. The formula is given in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials and
complete homogeneous polynomials, which we now deﬁne.

We denote the jth elementary symmetric polynomial in the p variables y1, . . . , yp by
ej(y1, . . . , yp), which is given by

ej(y1, . . . , yp) = Xl1≤l2≤···≤lj ≤p

yl1 · · · ylj .

13

(4.1)

The complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial of degree d in the q variables y1, . . . , yq
will be denoted by hd(y1, . . . , yq), and is given by

hd(y1, . . . , yq) = Xl1+···+lq =d

li≥0

yl1
1 · · · ylq
q .

(4.2)

For more on the theory of such polynomials see for example [10] or [3].

We denote by hd(E ) the dth homogeneous symmetric polynomial in the negative distinct
non-trivial Chern roots of E , i.e.

hd(E ) = hd(−L1, . . . , −Lm).

Before stating and proving our relative B´ezout formula we recall that by Theorem 3.3 of
[6] a divisor D ∈ A1P(E ) is of the form

D = π∗D + dζ,

where D is a divisor in X, ζ = c1(OP(E )(1)) ∩ [P(E )] and d is an integer. The relative
B´ezout-type formula is then given by the following

Theorem 4.1. Let N = dim(P(E )), D1, . . . , DN be N distinct divisors in P(E ), and let
Di and di be such that Di = π∗Di + diζ. Denote by α the intersection product

α = D1 · · · DN ∈ A∗P(E ),

and denote by ej (α) the jth elementary symmetric polynomial in Di/di, so that

ej (α) = ej(D1/d1, . . . , DN /dN ).

Then

π∗α = d1 · · · dN ·

dim(X)

Xj=0

hdim(X)−j(E )ej (α) ∈ A∗X.

(4.3)

Proof. As in the proof of Theorem 3.1 we ﬁrst assume all the non-trivial Chern roots of E
are distinct, which by Remark 2.1 we may do without any loss of generality. Expanding
α we obtain

N

α = α(ζ) = d1 · · · dN

ζ N −jej(α).

Now let n = rk(E ) − 1. Theorem 2.1 along with Lemma 3.2 then yields
