We study the renormalization ﬂow of the Higgs potential as a function of both ﬁeld amplitude
and energy scale. This overcomes limitations of conventional techniques that rely, e.g., on an
identiﬁcation of ﬁeld amplitude and RG scale, or on local ﬁeld expansions. Using a Higgs-Yukawa
model with discrete chiral symmetry as an example, our global ﬂows in ﬁeld space clarify the origin
of possible meta-stabilities, the fate of the pseudo-stable phase, and provide new information about
the renormalization of the tunnel barrier. Our results conﬁrm the relaxation of the lower bound
for the Higgs mass in the presence of more general microscopic interactions (higher-dimensional
operators) to a high quantitative accuracy.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The discovery of a Higgs boson at the LHC [1, 2] com-
pleted the search for the building blocks of the standard
model of particle physics. While the mass of the Higgs
boson is in principle a free parameter of the standard
model, it has long been known that it is not necessarily
an arbitrary parameter. For instance, assuming that the
description of fundamental physics in terms of standard-
model degrees of freedom is valid at a high energy scale
Λ and that the theory is suﬃciently weakly coupled, the
range of possible Higgs boson masses is restricted by a ﬁ-
nite range, the so-called infrared (IR) window [3–9]. The
fact that this IR window shrinks for increasing Λ can be
traced back to the ﬁxed-point structure of the RG ﬂow
[6, 10] which connects the mass of the Higgs boson to
that of the heaviest quark.1

The edges of the IR window [7, 12–38], i.e., the upper
and lower admissible values, for the Higgs mass are actu-
ally not sharply deﬁned, but depend on a number of ad-
ditional assumptions. This is most obvious for the upper
“triviality bound”, as the Higgs sector becomes strongly
coupled at high scales for large values of the Higgs mass.
Perturbative estimates of this bound, e.g., depend on an
ad hoc choice of coupling value up to which perturbation
theory is trusted. Nonperturbative methods have shown
that this upper bound relaxes considerably if one allows
the system to start microscopically with a strong Higgs
self-coupling [39, 40].

As is less well appreciated, a similar fuzziness also
holds for the lower edge of the IR window on which
we concentrate in the present work. This indeterminacy

1 This implies that the results of the present paper could equally
well be rephrased in terms of bounds on the top mass. This
might even be the more relevant viewpoint [11], as the top mass
is presently known less precisely. However, we stick to the “Higgs
boson mass” perspective in order to conform with a larger part
of the literature.

arises from the (implicit) assumptions imposed on the
precise form of the microscopic theory at the high scale
Λ. For instance, by considering only renormalizable oper-
ators in conventional perturbative estimates of the lower
bound, the couplings of all higher-order operators are
implicitly chosen to vanish at the high scale Λ. Strictly
speaking, this corresponds to ﬁxing inﬁnitely many fur-
ther parameters, in addition to the parameters of the
standard model.2

By contrast, if one deﬁnes the standard model more
agnostically in terms of its symmetries, ﬁeld content and
measured IR parameters, the microscopic interactions
quantiﬁed by the bare action at the high scale Λ remains
largely unspeciﬁed. It can contain inﬁnitely many oper-
ators and corresponding coupling constants which would
be computable if the underlying theory was known. It
is reasonable to assume that these couplings if measured
in units of the scale Λ are of order O(1). Still, an even
more strongly coupled UV regime is not excluded by ob-
servation. The fact that the perturbative description of
electroweak collider data works so well indicates that col-
liders so far probe a regime where Nature is close to
the Gaußian ﬁxed point of the renormalization group
(RG). Here, power-counting arguments hold and higher-
dimensional operators are irrelevant, exerting a negligi-
ble inﬂuence on IR observables. In turn, the IR observ-
ables dominantly constrain only the marginal and rele-
vant (renormalizable) operators of the bare action and
put hardly any bound on the irrelevant couplings.

In a series of works, it has recently been shown that
these unconstrained higher-dimensional operators in fact
can relax the lower edge of the IR window, i.e., can lower
the lower (stability) bound on the Higgs mass without
introducing metastability [39–41]. Comparatively sim-
ple modiﬁcations of the bare action, e.g., in terms of a

2 This statement holds for any ﬁnite value of Λ. If the limit Λ → ∞
could be taken, e.g., at an asymptotically free or asymptotically
safe ﬁxed point, all these parameters would be predictions of the
theory. Whether the standard model could have this property
is not fully understood, hence Λ presumably remains a ﬁnite
though unknown parameter of the model.

dimension-six operator at the Planck scale can lower the
lower mass bound by ∼ 1GeV, while preserving absolute
stability on all scales [41]. The mechanism behind this
relaxation of the lower edge has two aspects: ﬁrst, neg-
ative couplings of renormalizable operators which seem
to introduce an instability from a perturbative viewpoint
can still be associated with a fully stable potential in the
presence of the higher-dimensional operators. Second,
the higher-dimensional operators take inﬂuence on the
running of the renormalizable part over a range of scales
thus modifying the approach to the perturbative region
while leaving the IR region itself intact as addressed by
perturbation theory.

These results can already be observed in a simple
mean-ﬁeld study (large-N limit) as well as in extended
mean-ﬁeld approximation (1/N corrections), but unfold
more comprehensively in a controlled nonperturbative
study using the functional RG. They have been conﬁrmed
by lattice simulations in the range of scales accessible to
current lattice sizes [42–45]. Recent functional RG stud-
ies also including higher-order fermionic operators have
shown the same features [46–48]; for further studies of
higher-dimensional operators in this context, see, e.g.,
[49–54].

While controlled quantitative results have so far been
obtained for a small class of operators represented by
simple low-order polynomials of the ﬁeld, a possible
metastable regime with competing vacua has not been
explored so far.

The present work is devoted to a ﬁrst step in this direc-
tion, namely to study the full functional renormalization
of the Higgs eﬀective potential as a function of both ﬁeld
amplitude and RG scale. This is facilitated by the devel-
opment of pseudo-spectral methods for functional ﬂows
[55, 56]. If applied to the fully stable regimes studied be-
fore, our results conﬁrm the lowering of the Higgs mass
bounds to a high accuracy. In addition, the full poten-
tial solver allows to address the fate of the RG ﬂow in
potential metastable regimes and the renormalization of
the tunnel barrier.

Our present study is performed within a simple Higgs-
Yukawa model with a discrete chiral symmetry, which has
proved useful for addressing the qualitative properties of
the IR window. Our main results are read oﬀ from the
properties of the Higgs eﬀective potential as a function
of ﬁeld amplitude φ and RG scale k. A ﬁrst illustration
for such a fully stable ﬂow is shown in Fig. 1, where the
dimensionless potential u is depicted as a function of the
dimensionless ﬁeld amplitude ρ ∼ φ2 for various values
of k ranging from the UV towards the IR (blue to black)
where a vacuum expectation value has developed.

The paper is organized as follows:

in Sect. II, we in-
troduce our toy model and brieﬂy summarize some re-
cent results which are of relevance for our present study.
Section III is devoted to an extensive mean-ﬁeld study,
for the ﬁrst time also including the meta-stable regime.
Here, we also clarify the fate of a recently discovered
pseudo-stable phase [41] and discuss the connection with

the eﬀective single-scale potential obtained from conven-
tional perturbative constructions. In Sect. IV we inves-
tigate the full RG ﬂow of the entire scalar potential by
means of the functional RG. We compare the local be-
havior around the electroweak minimum as well as the
global behavior with the results obtained by polynomial
expansion of the potential and the mean-ﬁeld estimates.
While we still span the bare potential in terms of a few
polynomial operators in this work, the techniques used
here will facilitate future studies of general classes of bare
actions.

All mechanisms relevant for the present work can al-
ready be studied in a simple Higgs-Yukawa model corre-
sponding to the reduction of the standard model to the
top quark ψ with the largest Yukawa coupling, and a real
scalar Higgs degree of freedom φ. The classical euclidean
action of this model is given by:

(∂µφ)2 + UΛ(φ) + ¯ψi /∂ψ + i¯h φ ¯ψψ

.

The model features a discrete chiral Z2 symmetry, ψ →
2 γ5 , φ → −φ, mimicking the global
ei π
part of the electroweak symmetry group, and protecting
the fermion against acquiring a mass term. No mass-
less Goldstone bosons appear after spontaneous symme-
try breaking as the symmetry is discrete. Hence, the
particle spectrum is gapped in the broken phase as in
the standard model. This toy model was intensively dis-

in the literature, e.g., [39, 57–60].

In order to make semi-quantitative contact with the
standard model, we impose Coleman-Weinberg renormal-
ization conditions [61] on the eﬀective potential obtained
after integrating out all ﬂuctuations down to the IR,

where φ0 denotes the (renormalized) ﬁeld value at the
minimum of the potential3, and all couplings are also
considered to be renormalized at a suitable renormaliza-
tion point µ, e.g., µ = φ0. In the present work, we choose
for the observable parameters: mt = 173GeV for the top
mass, and φ0 ≡ v = 246GeV. The Higgs mass mH then
is treated as a function of the cutoﬀ and a functional of
the bare action, mH = mH[SΛ; Λ].

Despite this apparent physical ﬁxing, the simpliﬁed
model, of course, deviates quantitatively from the stan-
dard model in essential aspects:
for instance, whereas
the center of the IR window for the Higgs mass is near
∼ 150GeV for a Planck scale cutoﬀ in the standard model
[36], it is near ∼ 215GeV for the present simple model at
high energy scales [46] mainly due to the absence of the
gauge sectors.

B. Perturbative eﬀective single-scale potential

In order to make contact with the conventional per-
turbative treatment, we brieﬂy sketch the standard line
of argument to obtain an estimate of the eﬀective poten-
tial. For simplicity, we consider only the one-loop level.
Perturbatively, only the renormalizable operators of the
bare potential are considered,

depending as well on the renormalized running Yukawa
coupling h. For the present line of argument, it suﬃces
to ignore the running of h (it will be fully included in
our detailed studies later). The discussion can even be
simpliﬁed further by noting that the λ2-terms in Eq. (4)
are small compared to the h4 term for small Higgs masses
and large top masses.
In this limit which corresponds

The conventional perturbative estimate of the eﬀective
potential is then inspired by the Coleman-Weinberg form
of the eﬀective potential [61]. One assumes that the ef-
fective potential is well approximated by identifying the
dependence of the integrated scalar self-coupling on the
RG scale k with the scalar ﬁeld itself, λ2(k = φ). We em-
phasize, that the identiﬁcation k = φ mixes momentum
scale information k with the ﬁeld amplitude. In general,
the full eﬀective action in ﬁeld theory would provide sep-
arate information about the two scales which need not be
the same. By this identiﬁcation, we obtain a single-scale
potential which in our simple approximation reads

Note also, that the bare potential (3) remains completely
unspeciﬁed in this derivation. The implicit use of only
renormalizable operators together with the limit Λ → ∞
permitted by perturbative renormalizability seems to
suggest that the details of the bare potential are irrel-
evant.

Clearly, this single-scale potential develops an insta-
bility for large Yukawa couplings, i.e., large mt. For the
present choice of parameters, the instability occurs at a
scale of ∼ 107GeV in our toy model, see Fig. 2. This
instability is related to the running of λ2(k), which turns
negative at suﬃciently large k, cf. Eq. (5).
In the full standard model, the corresponding instabil-
ity scale is of order ∼ 1010GeV. Though current state-
of-the-art calculations [33, 36, 38] determine the single-
scale potential to NNLO precision, including two-loop
threshold corrections, and self-consistent resummations
[62, 63], the present rather cartoon-like presentation in a
toy model still captures the essence of the origin of the
instability occurring in the perturbative estimate of the
single-scale potential.

A qualitative diﬀerence arises in the standard model
from the electroweak gauge ﬂuctuations, which render
the φ4 coupling positive again at even higher scales such
that the single-scale potential becomes bounded from be-
low and a second minimum arises beyond the Planck scale

4
Λ → ∞, this dependence is physical and can be viewed
as a model for the details of the embedding into a more
fundamental underlying UV complete theory. For a close
contact with later sections, we use a piece-wise linear reg-
ulator familiar from functional RG studies [64, 65]; we
emphasize that all conclusions remain the same also for
a sharp momentum cutoﬀ, propertime or zeta-function
regularization, see [40]. We obtain,

Inserting Eq. (11) into Eq. (10) yields a globally stable
eﬀective potential for any value of the UV cutoﬀ Λ and
any admissible non-negative value of the bare φ4 coupling
λ2,Λ ≥ 0, cf. solid black line in Fig. 3. It is important
to stress that a bare potential of quartic type, Eq. (3),
with negative λ2,Λ would be inconsistent right from the
beginning, as the functional integral over the scalar ﬁeld
would be ill-deﬁned.

For completeness of the presentation, we recall that
the mass of the scalar particle now becomes a function
of the cutoﬀ and λ2,Λ, cf. [39, 40],

This demonstrates that a lower bound for the Higgs
mass is obtained by the physical restriction that the
bare potential of φ4-type at a given UV cutoﬀ Λ must
be bounded from below, i.e., λ2,Λ ≥ 0. Thus, the lower
bound (lower edge of the IR window) is given by λ2,Λ = 0

stable around the electroweak minimum, it develops an insta-

scalar self-coupling negative at large scales, cf. Eq. (5).

which turns out to be the global one. Therefore, the ab-
solute instability of the single-scale potential is a partic-
ularity of our model. Below, this will actually be useful
to make one of our main points more transparent.

III. MEAN-FIELD EFFECTIVE POTENTIAL

AND STABILITY

In the following, we use mean-ﬁeld methods to study
the eﬀective potential. We stick to the same simpliﬁ-
cations as before, ignoring bosonic ﬂuctuations and the
running of the Yukawa coupling, but keep track of all
scales involved, the momentum scale of ﬂuctuations k,
the ﬁeld amplitude φ and the UV cutoﬀ scale Λ. Parts of
this discussion follows [39, 40], where also more technical
details can be found. Here, we focus on the new aspects
arising for un-/metastable scenarios.

A. Mean-ﬁeld potential

With these prerequisites, the mean-ﬁeld potential is
directly related to the fermion determinant. More pre-
cisely, working with an explicit UV cutoﬀ Λ and an IR
regulator scale k, the mean-ﬁeld potential reads,

k = UΛ − 1
U MF
Ω

ln det Λ,k(i /∂ + ihφ),

(8)

where Ω denotes the spacetime volume, and irrelevant
ﬁeld independent constants are ignored. If we introduced
N fermion ﬂavors, the mean-ﬁeld potential would become
exact in the limit N → ∞. The notation detΛ,k indicates
that the determinant is regularized and includes momen-
tum modes p in the range k2 ≤ p2 ≤ Λ2. The result
is regularization dependent. As long as we do not send

IR physics kept ﬁxed; Λ = 2 · 107GeV (blue dotted line), and
Λ = 5 · 107GeV (orange dotted line). For Λ > 108GeV, there
is no visible diﬀerence between the mean-ﬁeld potential and
the single-scale potential (red dashed line) in this plot.

for this class of bare potentials. This way of determin-
ing the lower bound has been suggested in [57, 58], and
has been used in full non-perturbative lattice simulations
[66–69]. Generically, one observes a strong quantitative
agreement with mean-ﬁeld theory for this lower bound.
In this fashion, strong constraints on the existence of a
heavy fourth generation arise [70–73].

For the purpose of the present work, we reverse the
line of argument: for a given Higgs mass of, say mH =
125GeV, this implies that a maximal scale of UV ex-
tension Λ is obtained. Choosing the minimal admissible
value λ2,Λ = 0 a cutoﬀ of Λcr = 1.22· 107GeV is obtained
by writing Λ = Λ(m2
H, λ2,Λ). For larger values of the
UV cutoﬀ, Λ > Λcr no physical (mean-ﬁeld) RG trajec-
tory can be found that connects an admissible bounded
bare potential to an IR Higgs mass of 125GeV. As long
as Λ ≤ Λcr, the bare potential as well as the eﬀective
potential do not exhibit an instability. Figure 3 shows a
comparison between the mean-ﬁeld potential (solid/black
line) where the cutoﬀ is kept ﬁnite and the single-scale
potential (red/dashed line) where the cutoﬀ has implic-
itly been sent to inﬁnity. The single-scale potential ap-
proximation starts to break down for ﬁeld amplitudes,
where hφ/Λ (cid:38) O(1), i.e., where terms which are dropped
in the implicit Λ → ∞ limit are actually sizable.

It is, of course, possible to reduce the multi-scale mean-
ﬁeld potential to the single-scale potential. First, we
blindly enforce all renormalization conditions. In partic-
ular the ﬁrst condition in Eq. (2) for large cutoﬀs implies

For a cutoﬀ larger than the critical value Λcr, the poten-
tial develops an instability and rapidly approaches the
single-scale potential, see Fig. 4. For Λ > 108GeV, the
diﬀerence between the mean-ﬁeld eﬀective potential with
a ﬁnite cutoﬀ and the single-scale potential with implicit
limit Λ → ∞ becomes very small. Taking the naive limit
Λ → ∞, the single-scale potential (7) is obtained as ex-
pected.

We emphasize that the consistency condition that the
bare potential should be bounded from below for a well-
deﬁned generating functional is no longer fulﬁlled for all
Λ > Λcr. This can be directly read oﬀ from expression
(13): λ2,Λ has to be chosen negative for Λ > Λcr, and thus
already the bare potential is unstable. At this point, we
conclude that the apparent instability of the single-scale
potential appears due to an inconsistent UV boundary
condition for the theory. As long as the consistency con-
dition λ2,Λ ≥ 0 is fulﬁlled, no instability can be found
within the class of quartic bare potentials.

B. Generalized bare potentials

As already emphasized in [39–41], these observations
do not imply that in- or metastabilities are completely
excluded. Whether or not an in-/metastability occurs is
not a matter of the fermionic ﬂuctuations but has to be
seeded by the microscopic underlying theory. A speciﬁc
example from string phenomenology is given in [74].

fective ﬁeld theory, the embedding into a UV complete
theory is parametrized by the bare action at the cutoﬀ
Λ. Of course, the bare action is expected to host all op-

order O(1) in units of the cutoﬀ Λ.

Within the same mean-ﬁeld approximation as used be-

parameters λ2,Λ and λ3,Λ, cf. Eq. (12),

It is obvious that the previous lower bound of Eq. (12)
can be relaxed by a negative value for λ2,Λ, while a posi-
tive λ3,Λ can stabilize the bare potential. For small nega-
tive λ2,Λ and suﬃciently large λ3,Λ the eﬀective potential
as well as the potential at intermediate scales k are glob-
ally stable and have a unique minimum. In this regime,
it is easily possible to obtain Higgs masses below the per-
turbative lower bound, i.e., decrease the edge of the IR
window.

For even smaller λ2,Λ, i.e., larger absolute values of a
negative λ2,Λ, the eﬀective potential U MF
starts to de-
velop a second minimum towards lower RG scales k and
becomes metastable, while the bare potential UΛ is still
stable. For even smaller values of λ2,Λ, also the bare
potential can become metastable.

k

For an illustration, let us assume a ﬁxed cutoﬀ Λ =
107GeV. Within the class of quartic bare potentials (3),
the lowest Higgs mass according to Eq. (12) is given by
mH = 123.8GeV for λ2,Λ = 0. Stabilizing the more gen-
eral class of bare potentials (14) with a ﬁxed value of
λ3,Λ = 3, we can choose negative values of λ2,Λ, yielding
also smaller values of the Higgs mass, see Fig. 5. The
resulting mean-ﬁeld potentials are stable with a unique
(electroweak) minimum on all scales (blue solid line) un-
til we reach a value for the bare quartic coupling of
λ2,Λ = −0.065. For even smaller values of λ2,Λ, a sec-
ond minimum arises in the course of the mean-ﬁeld ﬂow,
while the bare potential still has a unique minimum. This
second minimum is a local minimum only for a small
range of λ2,Λ values, −0.0671 < λ2,Λ < −0.065. For
λ2,Λ < −0.0671, the second minimum becomes the global
one (blue dashed line), which renders the electroweak
minimum in the eﬀective potential metastable. Within
this regime of metastability, the Higgs mass can be made
arbitrarily small by a suitable choice of parameters even
without any metastability in the bare potential.

FIG. 5. Higgs masses for the class of generalized bare po-
tentials for Λ = 107GeV. The bare potential is stabilized by
λ3,Λ = 3. The horizontal black solid line marks the lower
Higgs mass consistency bound within quartic bare potentials.
The blue solid line indicates values for λ2,Λ where the IR po-
tential is stable while for the blue dashed line a metastability
occurs.

It is important to emphasize that the metastability ob-
served here in this model is a consequence of the shape
of the bare potential encoded in both renormalizable and
non-renormalizable operators. In the present model, this
metastability remains invisible in the perturbatively es-
timated single-scale potential which would predict com-
plete instability. We conclude that metastability prop-
erties of the model can only be reliably calculated if the
bare potential at a UV scale is known. The single-scale
potential is not suﬃcient as a matter of principle.

In the present model, this conclusion becomes obvi-
ous as the single-scale potential does not even exhibit
a metastable region. This is diﬀerent from the stan-
dard model, where the single-scale potential itself pre-
dicts metastability for light Higgs masses, as the single-
scale potential is stabilized by electroweak ﬂuctuations
again at high ﬁeld amplitudes. Still, the same conclusion
about the reliability of the metastability estimate of the
single-scale potential holds as for the simple model.

The fact that the metastability in the eﬀective poten-
tial is seeded in the bare potential is illustrated in Fig. 6.
Here, the eﬀective mean-ﬁeld potential (black solid line)
is shown as the diﬀerence between the bare potential
(blue dashed line) and the absolute value of the fermion
determinant (red dotted line). The left panel depicts the
case with stable bare as well as eﬀective potential (ini-
tial parameters: Λ = 107GeV, λ2,Λ = 0, λ3,Λ = 0). By
contrast, the right panel shows the case where a second
minimum arises in the eﬀective potential (initial parame-
ters: Λ = 107GeV, λ2,Λ = −0.15, λ3,Λ = 3). One clearly
sees how the modiﬁed structure of the generalized bare
potential with a negative λ2,Λ is responsible for the sec-
ond minimum at large scales besides the electroweak one
(the latter at φ = 246GeV is hardly visible on the scales
of the plot). We emphasize again that there is no pos-
sibility for the mean-ﬁeld potential to develop a second

minimum for the case of quartic bare potentials because
the bare potential always exceeds the fermion determi-
nant.

With the full mean-ﬁeld potential at hand, we can also
clarify the nature of the pseudo-stable phase observed in
a polynomial expansion of the eﬀective potential in [41].
In this approximation, RG ﬂows were observed that start
at k = Λ with a globally stable bare potential, then run
trough a metastable regime with two minima and ﬁnally
end up in the IR k = 0 with one stable minimum at the
Fermi scale. In the same spirit, we now expand the mean-
ﬁeld eﬀective average potential (9) around the minimum
at the origin and follow its ﬂow in comparison with the
ﬂow of the full mean-ﬁeld eﬀective potential. This is de-
picted in Fig. 7. Indeed, the potential approximated by a
polynomial expansion shows the same pseudo-stable be-
havior as observed in [41]. A second minimum appears
but disappears again after a short RG time. The poly-
nomial expansion thus looks stable again in the IR. This
is in contrast to the full mean-ﬁeld potential where the
second minimum survives the RG ﬂow towards the IR.
We conclude that the pseudo-stable phase is an artifact
of the ﬁnite convergence radius of the polynomial expan-
sion. The global eﬀective mean-ﬁeld potential exhibits a
metastability also in this phase.

IV. NONPERTURBATIVE FLOW OF THE

SCALAR POTENTIAL

A. Functional renormalization group

While the mean-ﬁeld approximation is highly conve-
nient for ﬁrst analytically controllable estimates, we have
to go beyond for quantitative accuracy. The functional
RG is an ideal tool for this task, as it resums large
classes of higher-order diagrams, automatically accounts
for threshold corrections and provides information about

the global RG ﬂow of the eﬀective potential, i.e., all rel-
evant scales can be studied independently. We use the
Wetterich equation [75] in order to compute the RG ﬂow
of the eﬀective action Γk,

The solution to this equation interpolates between the

The regulator function Rk implements the shell-by-shell
integration at the momentum scale k. Γ(2)

der,

The Wetterich equation (16) provides ﬂow equations for
the potential, the Yukawa coupling, and the wave func-

latter can be summarized by the anomalous dimensions

In Eq. (17), we have introduced the unrenormalized

where primes denotes derivatives with respect to ρ. Here,
we extract the ﬂow of the Yukawa coupling and the
anomalous dimensions at the (running) minimum of the
potential κ = ρmin ∼ φ2
0; see [82] for an extended ﬂow
in the Yukawa sector. The threshold functions l and m
encode the decoupling of massive modes. Evaluated for
a piece-wise linear regulator function [64, 65], these are
listed, for instance, in [39]. Of course, the perturbative
β functions can be recovered from these nonperturbative
ﬂow equations by neglecting resummation and threshold
eﬀects. The ﬂow equation also contains mean-ﬁeld the-
ory as a simple limit: ignoring the anomalous dimensions
as well as the ﬂow of the Yukawa coupling, and dropping
the bosonic ﬂuctuations ∼ ld
0 in Eq. (21), the integra-
tion of the potential ∂tu precisely yields the mean-ﬁeld
potential (9). Hence, all known limits are uniﬁed in the
functional RG framework which we can now use to go
beyond the perturbative/mean-ﬁeld studies.

the potential ﬂow by means of a polynomial expansion

pansion has been conﬁrmed for potentials [39] with a sin-
gle minimum at any given scale. As the example of the
seeming pseudo-stable phase above has shown, a proper
description of metastability doubtlessly requires a PDE
solver for the RG ﬂow of the full potential (21) as a func-
tion of both k and ρ.

successfully developed and applied in various functional
RG studies from low-energy QCD models [83, 84], critical
phenomena [85–87] to ultracold-gas systems [88]. The
particular diﬃculty in the present case arises from the
necessity to run the RG over many orders of magnitude
in the presence of a relevant operator φ2 of canonical
dimension 2. This requires substantial precision.

Another challenge is the approach to convexity which
is expected to hold for the full eﬀective potential [89, 90],
but is spoiled by both the perturbative single-scale po-
tential as well as the mean-ﬁeld approximation. Whereas
the approach to convexity is less interesting for the case of
a single minimum, it may become essential for metastable
scenarios as the tunneling lifetime depends on the shape
of the manifestly non-convex tunnel barrier.

B. Pseudo-spectral ﬂows

In general, the derivative expansion of the functional
RG results in a system of coupled partial diﬀerential
equations (PDEs). In the present case, we have to deal
with one such PDE (21) coupled to an ODE (22) and two
algebraic equations (23) and (24).

In order to obtain global information with high ac-
curacy, we advocate pseudo-spectral methods [91] which
span the solutions in terms of global basis functions of
high polynomial (or rational) degree. Under mild an-
alyticity assumptions, the convergence to the exact re-
sult is exponential [91]. In particular in comparison with
ﬁnite diﬀerence methods, pseudo-spectral methods are
memory minimizing, as a certain accuracy requires only
a comparatively small number of grid points.

In the following, we brieﬂy sketch our methods; for
more details, see [56]. It is worth mentioning that pseudo-
spectral methods have already successfully been applied
to various problems in physics in general [92]; for ﬁrst ap-
plications in the context of the functional RG, see [93, 94].
The present code development is based on a highly ac-
curate pseudo-spectral solver for computing global ﬁxed-
point solutions within the functional RG [55].

In principle, pseudo-spectral methods include any kind
of basis function system.
In the present work, we use
Chebyshev polynomials of the ﬁrst kind. Boundary ef-
fects can be controlled since the polynomials are deﬁned
on a ﬁnite interval. The behavior of higher-order coeﬃ-
cients provides an error estimate of the absolute remain-
der of the solution. As a main advantage also in practice,
function values, derivatives, and integrals of the objective
function are easily accessible from the Chebyshev coeﬃ-
cients by means of recursive algorithms yielding a high
precision calculation.

We apply pseudo-spectral methods in both the ﬁeld
and the RG time direction. For this, we subdivide the
time interval into patches, apply a Newton-Raphson it-
eration to each patch, and solve for the coeﬃcients. For
minimizing the number of coeﬃcients and increasing the

9

resolution in physically interesting regions, we use multi-
ple domains in ﬁeld direction. All these patches are con-
nected by additionally demanding matching conditions
for the objective function and a suﬃcient number of its
derivatives. The Newton-Raphson iteration provides an
error estimate for the solution of the equations.

As a result, this method is stable over many orders
of magnitude in k. This enables us to choose high UV
cutoﬀs. This choice is solely restricted by the number of
digits needed for tuning the IR quantities. As the ﬂow
of the present problem includes a scalar mass parameter
with canonical scaling of dimension 2, we need to tune ap-
proximately twice as many digits as the number of orders
of magnitude between the UV scale and the Fermi scale.
All full potential computations have been done with long
double. Thus, we restricted ourselves to a maximal UV
cutoﬀ of 1010GeV for the full potential calculation. In
principle, higher values for Λ are straightforwardly ac-
cessible by using a higher accuracy for the ﬂoating-point
arithmetics.

C. Higgs mass bounds

As a ﬁrst benchmark, we perform a comparison to lo-
cal polynomial solutions of the ﬂow equation. For this,
we compute Higgs masses for diﬀerent initial values for
the ﬂow equations over a large range of cutoﬀ values. In
Fig. 8, we depict the resulting IR Higgs mass as a func-
tion of the UV cutoﬀ Λ: for the restricted class of φ4 bare
potentials, the black data shows the resulting lowest pos-
sible Higgs mass, i.e., the conventional lower bound for
λ2,Λ = 0. Examples within the class of generalized bare
potentials that lead to a relaxation of the lower bound
are shown in red (λ2,Λ = −0.1, λ3,Λ = 3) and orange
(λ2,Λ = −0.15, λ3,Λ = 3). The solid lines mark the Higgs
masses computed within the polynomial truncation, and
ﬁlled circles indicate the Higgs masses resulting from the
pseudo-spectral full potential computation of this work.
The black and red line agree with the results of [39], and
illustrate the relaxation of the conventional lower bound
by higher-dimensional operators. The orange data corre-
sponds to a potential that develops a metastability (i.e.,
seems pseudo-stable in the polynomial expansion). For
all cases, the pseudo-spectral data lies perfectly on top of
the polynomial results. The full numerical PDE solution
thus provides a strong conﬁrmation that the polynomial
expansion is suitable for extracting local information such
as the Higgs mass (∼ curvature of the potential at φ = v).

D. Global ﬂows

Let us start with a closer look at the global behavior
of the ﬂow for the class of the φ4 bare potentials. Obvi-
ously, the polynomial truncation lacks in describing the
asymptotic behavior of the potential which can be seen
in Fig. 9. This is not surprising since the ﬂow equa-

10

FIG. 8. Higgs boson mass as a function of the UV cutoﬀ
for various bare potentials. The ﬁlled circles are obtained by
solving the full PDE system. These match perfectly with the
Higgs masses computed within a polynomial expansion (25)
of the scalar potential for the class of φ4-type bare poten-
tials (black, conventional “lower bound” λ2,Λ = 0) as well as
generalized bare potentials for the case where the eﬀective po-
tential is stable for Λ (cid:38) 104GeV (red, λ2,Λ = −0.1, λ3,Λ = 3)
or develops a metastability (orange, λ2,Λ = −0.15, λ3,Λ = 3).

FIG. 9. Comparison between the eﬀective potential of the
full calculation (black, kIR = 113.9GeV), the mean-ﬁeld result
(green dashed) and polynomial truncated potentials (dotted)
up to fourth order (orange), sixth order (red) and eighth order
(purple) for the stable case. The cutoﬀ is chosen to be Λ =
109GeV and bare couplings are tuned such that the Higgs
mass is 159.4GeV in all cases for reasons of comparison. The
vertical gray-dashed line indicates the position of the Fermi
minimum at φ = 246GeV.

tions suggest the asymptotic behavior to be that of the
UV potential ∼ φ4 because ﬂuctuations for large ﬁeld
amplitudes are suppressed. By contrast, the asymptotic
behavior of the polynomial expansion by construction is
ﬁxed to the highest power of the ﬁeld which is taken into
account in the truncation, ∼ φ2Np. These higher order
couplings are generated during the RG ﬂow, even if the
bare potential is of φ4 type. Therefore, considering only
terms up to φ4, (accidentally) displays the asymptotic
behavior best.

Naively, the polynomial truncation up to sixth order
in φ seems to suggest an instability; however, the in-
ﬂection point is beyond the radius of convergence of the
polynomial expansion around the Fermi scale. This ra-
dius of convergence is approximately of the order of the
curvature around the electroweak minimum [39]. For
large ﬁeld values the polynomial expansion behaves like
an asymptotic series with alternating signs between the
coeﬃcients. Incidentally, an alternating series is also ob-
tained from the polynomial expansion of the mean-ﬁeld
eﬀective potential. As long as the φ4 class of bare poten-
tials is considered, no hint for an in-/metastability can
be found within the radius of convergence of the poly-
nomial expansion. This is conﬁrmed by the fully stable
potential obtained from the global pseudo-spectral ﬂow.
We observe that the mean-ﬁeld potential agrees quite
well with the results for the full potential, for small as well
as for larger ﬁeld values, see green dashed curve in Fig. 9.
The ﬂuctuations of the bosons appear to play a minor
role in this parameter regime near the lower edge of the
IR window, where the fermionic contributions dominate.
Moreover, neglecting the anomalous dimensions and the
ﬂow of the Yukawa-coupling does not have a signiﬁcant

eﬀect. Thus, the simple mean-ﬁeld eﬀective potential
is an eﬀective tool to get ﬁrst insights into the global
behavior of the scalar potential, justifying the seemingly
severe approximations of Sect. III.

The qualitative picture remains the same for full ﬂows
also in the class of generalized bare potentials. For those
cases where no second minimum emerges during the poly-
nomial truncated ﬂow, we observe that also the full ﬂow
does not develop an outer minimum for ﬁeld values larger
than the Fermi scale. Our new results hence conﬁrm
the existence of a class of stable bare potentials giving
rise to Higgs masses below the conventional lower bound
as, for instance, depicted by the red curve in Fig. 8 for
Λ (cid:38) 104GeV. Therefore, the mechanism of lowering the
lower bound for completely stable potentials remains ac-
tive beyond the polynomial expansion and the mean-ﬁeld
analysis. Thus higher-order operators can diminish the
lower Higgs mass bound of the standard model.

Let us take a closer look at the inner workings of the
equations:
for large ﬁeld amplitudes in the asymptotic
regime of the potential, all ﬂuctuations are suppressed as
the threshold functions approaching zero. In this regime,
the ﬂow is dominated by dimensional scaling, i.e., the ﬁrst
two terms in Eq. (21). This holds for the φ4 as well as
for the generalized class of bare potentials irrespectively
of the stability properties.

Deviations from the mean-ﬁeld limit require relevant
bosonic ﬂuctuations.
In the small coupling (i.e., small
Higgs mass) regime, this can indeed occur in the full ﬂow
due to threshold eﬀects of the following type:
if a sec-
ond minimum emerges seeded by a suitable bare poten-
tial, the curvature near the top of the barrier between
the minima is negative, such that the bosonic thresh-
0(u(cid:48) + 2ρu(cid:48)(cid:48); ηφ) is enhanced. This type of
old function ld

property in the limit k → 0 for the bosonic potential, see
[76, 90]. However, at ﬁnite k, the regulator term
e.g.
∼ Rk sources a non-convex contribution which vanishes
in the limit k → 0.

For potentials with a single minimum, it is known that
convexity of the running potential sets in rather late in
RG time, i.e., convexity is driven by the very deep IR
modes which are often no longer relevant for the IR ob-
servables. For instance in the examples above, we have
stopped the ﬂow at scales kIR ∼ 10 . . . 100GeV, where
the IR Fermi scale observables have already settled to
their physical values. Still, for these values of k, the ap-
proach to convexity has not fully set in yet. Whereas
this demonstrates that convexity is not important for
the static observables, it is an interesting question as
to whether the approach to convexity can be important
for estimates of the tunneling rate between two diﬀerent
minima. The relevance of this question becomes obvi-
ous from the fact that any tunneling barrier in a convex
potential is (naively) exactly zero by construction.

In order to understand the onset of convexity in the
present model, let us start with the simpler case with
only one minimum at the Fermi scale. Here, convexity
only aﬀects the inner region of the potential with φ < v.
Technically, convexity of the eﬀective potential is gener-
ated by singularities in the bosonic propagators entering
the threshold functions. In the present case, the bosonic

exhibiting a singularity at u(cid:48) + 2ρu(cid:48)(cid:48) → −1, or u(cid:48) → −1
for small ρ or small u(cid:48)(cid:48). The ﬂow avoids this singularity
by renormalizing the negative curvature of the potential

k (φ) ∼ k2(u(cid:48)+2ρu(cid:48)(cid:48)) (cid:38) −k2 → 0
with k → 0. This establishes convexity for k → 0.

In comparison to purely bosonic models, fermionic ﬂuc-
tuations delay convexity since they enter the ﬂow equa-
tion with an opposite sign, cf. the last term in Eq. (21).
Thus, bosonic ﬂuctuations have to exceed the fermionic
ﬂuctuations ﬁrst. As convexity also introduces a non-
analyticity at φ = v, its onset becomes numerically ﬁrst
visible in higher derivatives. Therefore, we consider the
ﬁrst derivative of the potential u(cid:48) in the following. The
balancing between bosons and fermions also implies that
the onset of convexity becomes more pronounced if the
boson coupling λ2 is enhanced relative to the fermion
coupling h.
In terms of physical parameters, this im-
plies that convexity should become more prominent for
larger Higgs-to-top mass ratios. In Fig. 11, we plot u(cid:48) for
three diﬀerent ratios mH/mt. The ﬂow has been stopped
at a scale kIR such that the potentials have the same
distance from the singularity of the bosonic propagator
1 − |u(cid:48)(0)| = 0.01. The faster approach to convexity
then is directly visible in terms of the position of non-
analyticity ρkink which we observe to move towards larger
ﬁeld amplitudes if mH/mt ∼ λ2/h increases. By con-

metastable case obtained by the full pseudo-spectral calcu-
lation where the anomalous dimensions are computed at the
electroweak vev (black/lower solid line, kIR = 105.5GeV), at
the outer minimum (red/upper solid line, kIR = 93.3GeV)
and the mean-ﬁeld result (green dashed line). Setting the
anomalous dimensions by hand to zero would yield a rather
good agreement with the mean ﬁeld potential. The Higgs
mass is tuned to mH = 25GeV where the UV-cutoﬀ is 5TeV
and λ3,Λ = 1.

bosonic enhancement is only visible in a full potential
ﬂow. For a meaningful comparison between mean-ﬁeld
and full ﬂow, we tune the bare potential such that the
IR physics including the Higgs mass is kept ﬁxed. For il-
lustrative purposes, we choose a UV cutoﬀ of only 5TeV,
a Higgs mass of 25GeV and λ3,Λ = 1. The resulting po-
tentials end up in the metastable regime as depicted in
Fig. 10. The mean-ﬁeld potential (dashed line) diﬀers
from the full solutions (solid lines) integrated down to an
IR value of kIR ∼ 100GeV. The full solutions correspond
to deﬁning the anomalous dimensions at the local Fermi
minimum (black) or at the second global minimum (red).
These curves diﬀer as ﬁelds and couplings are renormal-
ized diﬀerently within the two schemes, with the black
curve corresponding to a renormalization choice better
resolving the Fermi minimum and the red curve better
suited for the second minimum. In other words, the axes
for the diﬀerent solid lines have a diﬀerent meaning due
to the diﬀerent ﬁeld rescaling during the ﬂow.
If the
anomalous dimensions were artiﬁcially set to zero, mean-
ﬁeld and full potential results would still match rather
well.

E. Convexity of the eﬀective potential

By deﬁnition of the eﬀective action as a Legendre
transform of the Schwinger functional, we expect the full
eﬀective action and particularly the eﬀective potential to
be convex functions of the ﬁeld. This convexity property
cannot be seen neither in the perturbative construction
of the single-scale potential nor in the mean-ﬁeld approxi-
mation. The Wetterich equation does have this convexity

0500100015002000-4-2024ϕ[GeV]Ueff[109GeV4]12

sition may vary depending on the scale and the precise
choice of parameters. As the maximum of the potential is
situated within the region where u(cid:48) + 2ρu(cid:48)(cid:48) < 0 for larger
ﬁelds, the ﬂat region eventually extends beyond the max-
imum, signiﬁcantly aﬀecting the tunnel barrier for small
scales k (cid:46) 100GeV. For small ﬁelds, the fermions still
control the ﬂow at k ∼ 100GeV. However, for decreas-
ing scale k the bosonic ﬂuctuations win out over the
fermionic ones and convexity sets in as well, similar to
Fig. 11. We emphasize that the approach to convexity
appears to set in at diﬀerent scales for large ﬁeld ampli-
tudes than for small ones.

In the present example, convexity aﬀects the tunnel
barrier at scales k which are more than an order of mag-
nitude smaller than the ﬁeld amplitude of the barrier
and the outer minimum. A calculation of the tunnel rate
which is dominated by the latter scales hence is expected
to be only weakly inﬂuenced by the approach to convex-
ity. As a general rule, we conclude that the standard
recipes for calculations of the tunnel rate [97, 98] remain
unaﬀected as long as the fermion ﬂuctuations dominate
the renormalization of the potential. Whether or not
this is the case at the relevant scales of interest will in
general depend on the details of the scale-dependent po-
tential and thus also on the details of the bare potential.
As soon as the boson ﬂuctuations become important, the
approach to convexity has also be accounted for in esti-
mates of the tunneling rate.

In the functional RG context, a proposal for this has
been worked out for scalar models in [99]. A formal-
ism that can also systematically deal with further ra-
diative eﬀects in the resulting inhomogeneous instanton
background on top of a radiatively generated potential
has recently been developed with the help of a self-
consistent functional scheme based on the 2PI eﬀective
action [100, 101].

We would like to emphasize the necessity of a simulta-
neous consistent treatment of the renormalization ﬂow of
the potential together with the ﬂuctuation contributions
in a tunnel-rate calculation – even if the bare potential
was known exactly. Of course, unknown higher dimen-
sional operators then further add to the indeterminacy of
the vacuum decay rate [41, 102–105]. For instance, the
inﬂuence of gravity-induced higher dimensional operators
has been studied in [106–109].

F. Quantum phase diagram of the Higgs-Yukawa

model

Can the outer global minimum be used to deﬁne the
electroweak vacuum? If the occurrence of metastability
is rather generic in presence of higher-dimensional opera-
tors, could it be possible to ﬁx physical parameters with
respect to the global minimum as the Fermi scale? In
order to address these questions, we now reconsider the
model from a more general viewpoint.

So far, we have ﬁxed the model with the help of the

FIG. 11. The approach to convexity of the potential
is
faster if the relation between bosonic and fermionic coupling
mH/mt increases (from green/top to blue/bottom: mH/mt =
0.23, 0.66, 1.12. Here, the ﬁrst derivative of the potential as
a function of the dimensionful ﬁeld invariant is depicted. All
potentials exhibit a minimum (i.e. u(cid:48) = 0) at φ = 246GeV
(φ2/2=30258GeV2). The approach to convexity becomes
manifest by a characteristic ﬂattening of the inner region
and u(cid:48) approaching u(cid:48) → −1, see text. We have chosen
Λ = 103GeV and mH = 39.7GeV for the green/top curve
stopping the ﬂow at kIR = 33.4GeV, and Λ = 106GeV
and mH = 113.6GeV for the orange/middle curve stopping
at kIR = 80GeV. The blue curve is added for illustration;
here Λ = 6.5 · 104GeV, vev = 246GeV, mt = 426.3GeV,
mH = 476.6GeV, and kIR = 264.5GeV, such that the curve is
not tuned to the physical top mass in terms of the renormal-
ization conditions (2).

trast, if mH/mt is small, the characteristic ﬂat region of
u(cid:48) is hardly visible at this particular scale kIR and would
increase only towards even smaller scales.

It should be emphasized that convexity is a notoriously
diﬃcult problem for pseudo-spectral methods, since it
introduces a non-analyticity which violates the assump-
tions on the function space for which exponential conver-
gence can be proved. Hence, the numerics will unavoid-
ably face a singularity problem in the very deep IR. For
further adapted methods, see [95, 96].

Let us now turn to the more interesting case of two
minima which is numerically more challenging since the
ﬁeld-dependent “mass term” becomes negative, u(cid:48) +
2ρu(cid:48)(cid:48) < 0, not only for small ﬁelds but also for a sec-
ond region at larger ﬁelds. As an illustrative example,
we choose a similar ﬂow as above. We plot this mass
term in the region of both minima of the tunnel barrier,
cf. Fig. 12 (left panel). For comparison we show u(cid:48)(ρ) as
well. The dashed vertical lines indicate the position of
both minima and the maximum in between. Convexity
becomes ﬁrst visible for larger ﬁelds at the minimum of
the mass term which tends to u(cid:48) + 2ρu(cid:48)(cid:48) → −1 after k
has dropped below the scale of the top quark, cf. Fig. 12
(right panel). For the current example, this minimum of
the mass term is located in between the maximum and
the outer minimum of the potential, but this relative po-

FIG. 12. Onset of convexity at a scale k ∼ 100GeV for the case of two minima. Whereas the small-ﬁeld region is still dominated
by fermionic ﬂuctuations, the bosons control the ﬂow for larger ﬁeld amplitudes, especially in the region of the minimum of
the ﬁeld-dependent mass term u(cid:48) + 2ρu(cid:48)(cid:48). Left panel: mass term and the ﬁrst derivative of the potential u(cid:48) over a wide ﬁeld
range. The vertical dashed lines mark the location of both minima and the maximum of the tunnel barrier of the potential in
between. The minimum of the mass term approaches the singularity u(cid:48) + 2ρu(cid:48)(cid:48) → −1, triggering the approach to convexity.
This is shown in the right panel in detail for decreasing scale k ∈ {112.5, 110, 109.5}GeV from top (green) to bottom (blue).
For this example ﬂow, we have used mH = 24.1GeV, λ3,Λ = 1 and Λ = 5TeV.

Instead,

renormalization conditions (2) applied to the ﬁrst or in-
nermost minimum.
let us now start from a
ﬁxed UV cutoﬀ Λ with some bare potential bounded
from below and read oﬀ the IR phases from the eﬀec-
tive potential at some IR scale k where all modes have
decoupled (apart from the approach to convexity). We
are most interested in this quantum phase diagram as a
function of the (super-)renormalizable operators ∼ m2
Λφ2
and ∼ λ2,Λφ4, as the electroweak precision data tells
us that the standard model is suﬃciently close to the
Gaußian ﬁxed point, where perturbation theory based on
these operators works very well. In other words, higher-
dimensional operators do not take a momentarily mea-
surable inﬂuence on collider data.

In the language of critical phenomena, the standard
model appears to be close to a second-order quantum
phase transition that eﬀectively allows to push the UV
cutoﬀ to large values (compared to collider scales). The
natural candidate in the standard model
is the elec-
troweak (quantum) phase transition represented by the
order-disorder phase transition of discrete chiral symme-
try in our simple model. It is, in fact, straightforward to
verify by means of perturbation theory, mean-ﬁeld the-
ory or the functional RG that this phase transition is
of second order for φ4 type bare potentials in the stable
regime. The “control parameter” for the quantum phase
transition is the bare mass term m2
Λ.

In the following, we perform this investigation for the
class of generalized bare potentials. For this, we ﬁx
λ3,Λ = 1 as a representative of a higher-dimensional op-
erator that induces absolute stability. We expect the fol-
lowing results to hold also for other polynomial operators
that ensure absolute stability for large ﬁeld amplitudes.
For technical simplicity, we keep the Yukawa coupling
h2 ∼ O(1) ﬁxed and also neglect the anomalous dimen-
sions, as both do not induce qualitative diﬀerences. Still,

we keep the full bosonic ﬂuctuation contribution to the
ﬂow of the potential.

Choosing λ2,Λ negative but with a small absolute
value, the potential will still show only one minimum and
the phase transition as a function of m2
Λ still is of second
order as for the φ4-class, cf. left-hand side of Fig. 13. In-
creasing the absolute value of a negative λ2,Λ a bit, and
starting with a large value of m2
Λ, the suﬃciently nega-
tive λ2,Λ may seed a local higher minimum at large ﬁeld
amplitudes. Nevertheless, the system is in the symmet-
ric phase with the global minimum at φ = 0 (upper left
part of Fig. 13). (On the left-hand side of this ﬁgure,
we do not further distinguish between the existence or
non-existence of a further local outer minima; potentials
with a local outer minimum shown here only represent
possible examples.)

Decreasing m2

Λ, we indeed observe a second-order
phase transition to a broken phase driven by fermion ﬂuc-
tuations where the order parameter φ0 = v is switched
on continuously, cf. white region in Fig. 13. A local
higher minimum at larger ﬁeld amplitudes may arise by
decreasing m2
Λ or persists if it already existed. It is this
second-order phase transition which can serve to deﬁne
a “continuum limit” essentially establishing cutoﬀ inde-
pendence.

Decreasing m2

Λ further ﬁrst leads to a lowering of the
outer minimum such that the inner minimum becomes
metastable (dotted region). The phase transition be-
tween the two cases is of ﬁrst order (dashed lines). For
even smaller mass parameters m2
Λ, the inner minimum
vanishes discontinuously while the outer remains (gray-
shaded region in Fig. 13). We also classify this discon-
tinuous change of the system as a ﬁrst-order transition,
even though it would not correspond to a thermal phase
transition: on both sides of the lower dashed line the
system is dominated by the global minimum in the ther-

metastable (dotted region) on both sides of the transi-
tion. In this regime of bare potentials, the separation of
IR physics from the UV scale hence goes along with a
metastability.

We can also compare the phase portraits for ﬁxed m2
Λ
and use λ2,Λ as control parameter. For instance, the
transition marked by the gray thick arrow is a ﬁrst-order
broken-to-broken transition. This is likely to correspond
to an equivalent transition ﬁrst observed in lattice simu-
lations of a similar chiral model [43].

We emphasize that the phase portraits determined
here correspond to quantum phase transitions with con-
trol parameters corresponding to parameters of the bare
action. This is a priori unrelated to the nature of ﬁnite
temperature phase transitions in the same model, even
though a relation might be established dynamically be-
cause of a thermal decoupling of the fermions. For recent
lattice studies, see [45, 110].

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have investigated the renormalization ﬂow of the
eﬀective scalar potential keeping the full dependence on
all relevant scales: the ﬁeld amplitude φ, an RG scale k
and the UV cutoﬀ scale Λ. This is necessary to overcome
the limitations of conventional approximation schemes,
relying on identiﬁcations such as k = φ, or implicit per-
turbative limits Λ → ∞. The advantage of keeping the
full scale dependence becomes obvious for the analysis of
metastabilities.

Using a simple Higgs-Top-Yukawa model as an exam-
ple, our analysis demonstrates that metastabilities are
not primarily induced by fermion ﬂuctuations, but have
to be seeded by suitable structures in the bare poten-
tial. In particular, metastabilities cannot occur if a well-
deﬁned bare action is restricted to contain only renormal-
izable operators. Upon the inclusion of suitable higher-
dimensional operators, metastabilities generically occur
for small Higgs masses and large cutoﬀs – at least within
the class of simple polynomial bare potentials studied in
this work.

Whereas these latter conclusions are in part reminis-
cent to results obtained within perturbative estimates
based on a single-scale eﬀective potential (k = φ), it
is worthwhile to note some decisive diﬀerences: our ap-
proach allows for addressing arbitrary bare potentials,
deﬁning the model purely in terms of its symmetry, ﬁeld
content and a minimal set of IR parameters. No assump-
tion about the manifest absence of an inﬁnity of irrele-
vant operators is made. While the occurrence of higher-
dimensional operators is conventionally interpreted as
particle physics beyond the standard model (e.g.,
in-
duced by integrating out heavy particle multiplets), our
approach allows to also associate such operators to any
origin that can be parametrized in terms of any eﬀec-
tive action, e.g., a coarse-grained continuum action in a
spacetime arising from discrete building blocks.

FIG. 13. Quantum phase portraits of the IR eﬀective poten-
tials with possible metastabilities seeded from the bare action.
As an example, the large amplitude ρ ∼ φ2 region is stabilized
by a φ6 operator in the UV. The phase portraits are sketched
for various initial values for a negative bare λ2,Λ and suitable
mass parameters m2
Λ near the critical regions. In the dotted
region the eﬀective potential is metastable, while it is stable in
the white and gray-shaded region. In the gray-shaded region
only the outer minimum exists.

modynamic limit.

This analysis demonstrates that only the transition be-
tween the symmetric and the symmetry-broken phase,
which is driven by fermion ﬂuctuations, is of second or-
der. Therefore, only this transition can be used to sep-
arate the cutoﬀ scale from the IR physics in this model.
This forces us to associate the Fermi scale with the in-
nermost minimum driven by fermion-ﬂuctuations. The
outer one seeded by the bare action cannot be used for
a deﬁnition of the Fermi scale as it is highly unlikely to
match with the perturbative description of electroweak
precision data. In our ﬂows, this mismatch becomes vis-
ible in the practical diﬃculty to push the cutoﬀ beyond
∼ 1TeV while satisfying all renormalization conditions
with v corresponding to the outer minimum.

For negative λ2,Λ with an even larger absolute value
(right-hand side of Fig. 13), the phase portraits are sim-
ilar in the sense that only the transition driven by the
fermionic ﬂuctuations in the inner region of the potential
is a second-order transition. The diﬀerence is that this
transition occurs only after the outer minimum seeded by
the bare action has become the global one. As a conse-
quence, both the symmetric phase for larger m2
Λ as well
as the fermion driven broken phase (inner minimum) are

In this work, we have studied global RG ﬂows of the
potential using pseudo-spectral methods. This facilitates
to study the full RG evolution of competing minima, to
analyze the quantum phase diagram of the model, and to
quantify the approach to convexity. The latter is not ac-
cessible in perturbation theory or mean-ﬁeld theory. The
global ﬂows also serve to conﬁrm earlier results from local
ﬂows evaluated at the running Fermi minimum to a high
accuracy, such as, for instance, the relaxation of the per-
turbative lower bound on the Higgs mass. On the other
hand, the global ﬂow also reveals the limitations of the lo-
cal ﬂow in metastable regimes as competing minima turn
out to be beyond the radius of convergence of local ﬂows.
Further, the global ﬂows also demonstrate the usefulness
of the mean-ﬁeld approximation in the small-Higgs-mass
regime.

Finally, we emphasize that a full determination of con-
sistency bounds for the IR observables of the standard

model as a function of the cutoﬀ Λ as the scale of max-
imum UV extension has not yet been completed. For
this, the mapping of a wide range of bare actions to the
IR observables would have to be computed with the RG,
technically corresponding to an extremization problem
in an inﬁnite-dimensional space. The capability of han-
dling global ﬂows and extending the current studies to
nonpolynomial interactions will be a necessary prerequi-
site for this.
