ABSTRACT
We present an intrinsic AGN SED extending from the optical to the submm, derived
with a sample of unobscured, optically luminous (νLν,5100> 1043.5 erg/s) QSOs at
z < 0.18 from the Palomar Green survey. The intrinsic AGN SED was computed by
removing the contribution from stars using the 11.3µm polycyclic aromatic hydrocar-
bon (PAH) feature in the QSOs’ mid-IR spectra; the 1σ uncertainty on the SED ranges
between 12 and 45 per cent as a function of wavelength and is a combination of PAH
ﬂux measurement errors and the uncertainties related to the conversion between PAH
luminosity and star-forming luminosity. Longwards of 20µm the shape of the intrin-
sic AGN SED is independent of the AGN power indicating that our template should
be applicable to all systems hosting luminous AGN (νLν,5100 or LX(2−10keV) &1043.5
erg/s). We note that for our sample of luminous QSOs, the average AGN emission is
at least as high as, and mostly higher than, the total stellar powered emission at all
wavelengths from the optical to the submm. This implies that in many galaxies hosting
powerful AGN, there is no ‘safe’ broadband photometric observation (at λ < 1000µm)
which can be used in calculating star-formation rates without subtracting the AGN
contribution. Roughly, the AGN contribution may be ignored only if the intrinsic AGN
luminosity at 5100˚A is at least a factor of 4 smaller than the total infrared luminosity
(LIR; 8-1000µm) of the galaxy. Finally, we examine the implication of our work in
statistical studies of star-formation in AGN host galaxies.

INTRODUCTION

The debate about a possible connection between galaxies
and their supermassive black holes has been long-standing,
originally fuelled by two global observations: (i) the corre-
lation between black hole mass and bulge stellar mass or
velocity dispersion in the nearby Universe (e.g. Magorrian
et al. 1998; Ferrarese & Merritt 2000) and (ii) the com-
parable temporal evolution of the star-formation rate den-
sity and AGN accretion rate density (e.g. Boyle & Terlevich
1998). The idea that star-formation and AGN accretion are
causally connected has become an essential component in
theoretical models of galaxy evolution, as AGN feedback is
required to regulate the formation and number of massive
galaxies (e.g. Croton et al. 2006, Bower et al. 2006).

The connection between AGN and their hosts has of-
ten been examined by means of the location of galaxies in
colour-magnitude space (e.g. Strateva et al. 2001; Baldry et
al. 2004). The sparsity of galaxies in transition between the
‘blue cloud’ of star-forming galaxies and the ‘red sequence’ of

passive ellipticals has founded hypotheses in which energetic
events associated with the central black hole are responsi-
ble for terminating star-formation on short timescales (e.g.
Granato et al. 2004; Springel et al. 2005). Studies have ex-
amined, albeit inconclusively, whether the colours of AGN
hosts are an indication of the quenching of star formation;
Georgakakis et al. (2008) and Schawinski et al. (2009) ﬁnd
that AGN host galaxies are transitioning from the blue cloud
to the red sequence, supporting such a scenario, whereas
Westoby et al. (2007) and Cardamone et al. (2010) ﬁnd a
large fraction of AGN in passive galaxies. Recently, Syme-
onidis et al. (2013b) found that the overlap in optical colour-
colour and colour-magnitude space of star-forming galaxies
(SFGs) and type II AGN at z < 1.5 indicates that SFGs are
on average three times more likely to host a type II AGN
than would be expected serendipitously, if AGN and star-
formation events were unrelated.

Although measured star-formation rates (SFRs) of
AGN host galaxies span a large range, sometimes reaching

2 M. Symeonidis et al.

a few thousand M⊙/yr (e.g. Isaak et al. 2002; Priddey et
al. 2003a; 2003b ; Lutz et al.2008; Silverman et al. 2009;
Mainieri et al. 2011, Dai et al. 2012; Khan-Ali et al. 2015;
Podigachoski et al. 2015), it is not yet clear whether and/or
how the AGN accretion rate and its host’s SFR are con-
nected. Some studies show that the AGN accretion rate is
well correlated with SFR over a large range in AGN lumi-
nosity (e.g. Rovilos et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2013; Hickox
et al. 2014), whereas others report that the correlation is
almost non-existent at low AGN luminosities but becomes
stronger at high AGN luminosities (e.g. Shao et al. 2010;
Rosario et al. 2012; 2013), or that the two quantities are
not correlated (e.g. Rawlings et al. 2013; Azadi et al. 2015;
Stanley et al. 2015). Page et al. (2012) and Barger et al.
(2015) show that the most luminous AGN do not reside in
the most highly star-forming hosts, whereas Harrison et al.
(2012) present contrasting results and Raﬀerty et al. (2011)
ﬁnd that luminous AGN are more common in systems with
high SFRs.

A possible reason for discrepant results amongst these
studies, could be the diﬃculties encountered when dealing
with AGN contamination to the galaxies’ spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) and SFR estimates. Currently, one of
the most widely used methods of calculating star-formation
rates is with IR/submm continuum data, since IR emission is
an excellent tracer of young star-forming/starburst regions,
particularly in galaxies with high SFRs where the contribu-
tion from dust heating from older stars is minimal. How-
ever, in AGN host galaxies, in addition to starlight-heated
dust emission, the infrared SED also includes a contribution
from the AGN: UV/optical light from the AGN is expected
to be intercepted by dust in its vicinity (i.e. the torus) as
well as dust distributed over kpc scales in the host galaxy.
Indeed, unless the torus is all enveloping and no light can
escape, then a scenario whereby UV/optical light from the
AGN is not intercepted by the dust over kpc scales in the
host galaxy is not realistic. A similar argument was made by
Sanders et al. (1989) who concluded that AGN must con-
tribute to dust heating over kpc scales. As a result, when
dealing with dust-reprocessed UV/optical radiation from an
AGN, two components need to be taken into account: (i)
IR emission from the AGN-heated dust in the torus and (ii)
IR emission from AGN-heated dust in the host galaxy, the
former peaking at shorter wavelengths than the latter. Here
we aim to provide an intrinsic AGN SED up to 1000 µm,
reproducing as far as possible the total AGN contribution
in the far- IR/submm. Our motivation is simple: if we are
to truly understand the connection between AGN and star-
formation then we must be conﬁdent of the characteristics
of the intrinsic AGN emission.

The paper is laid out as follows: in section 2 we describe
our criteria for the sample selection and ﬁnalise the sample
for this work. In section 3 we describe the ﬁtting of SEDs and
produce an intrinsic AGN template. In section 4 we discuss
our results and we conclude with section 5. Throughout,
we adopt a concordance cosmology of H0=70 km s−1Mpc−1,
ΩM=1-ΩΛ=0.3.

et al. (2007). Black diamonds and black upper limits are for the

the 11.3µm PAH feature. Note that above z=0.18 (dashed line)
the PAH detections are severely incomplete - this serves as a cut
for our sample.

2 THE SAMPLE

2.1 Selection criteria

As outlined in section 1, our study aims to understand the
intrinsic AGN SED, particularly in the infrared. Naturally,
the ideal sample for this would be galaxies with no stars so
that the total broadband SED would be the result of AGN
emission only (direct or reprocessed). This is of course im-
possible, so the next best approach is to select a sample
of galaxies whose stellar output is small compared to the
AGN emission. Low luminosity AGN are not appropriate
for such a study, as their radiative output is often drowned
by their host’s over most of the electromagnetic spectrum
making their intrinsic SEDs diﬃcult to extract. Our ﬁrst re-
quirement is, therefore, that our sample should be composed
of optically-luminous, broad-line AGN which dominate the
global SED, at least from X-ray to near-IR wavelengths.
The second requirement is that the sample is at low red-
shift where on average star-formation rates are low, but also
so that available photometry can probe longer rest-frame
wavelengths. Since our aim is to extract the AGN SED from
the galaxies’ total emission, the third requirement is that we
have a measure of the SFR independently of the galaxies’
broad-band SED. For optically luminous AGN, the optical
spectra cannot be used to extract information about the
host, whereas the mid-IR spectra, and in particular Poly-
cyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) features, are a viable
alternative.

In line with the criteria outlined above, our sample
consists of Palomar-Green (PG) QSOs with mid-IR spec-
troscopy, drawn from Shi et al. (2007). PG QSOs are selected
in the B band, have blue U − B colours, a star-like appear-

ance and broad emission lines; see Schmidt & Green (1983).
Shi et al. (2007) present mid-IR Spitzer /IRS spectra and
examine the mid-IR and star-forming properties for the en-
tire parent PG QSO sample up to z=0.5 (see also Schweitzer
et al. 2006; Netzer et al. 2007; Veilleux et al. 2009). Since
the availability of PAH ﬂux measurements is central to our
work, in order to determine the redshift range for our sample
we examine the distribution of PAH ﬂuxes as a function of
redshift (Fig. 1). It is clear that above z=0.18 the PAH de-
tections are sparse, hence we subsequently select PG QSOs
at z < 0.18 (58 sources).

2.2 PAH-derived star-formation rates

PAH features appearing in the mid-IR 6-13µm (e.g. Alla-
mandola et al. 1985; 1989; Laurent et al. 1999, Sturm et al.
2000) have been detected in a wide range of sources and used
as diagnostic tools for physical processes in the ISM; they are
thought to originate in photo-dissociation regions and are
excited by UV photons from massive young stars (e.g. Roche
& Aitken 1985; Roche et al. 1991; Li & Draine 2002). As a
result PAHs are extensively used as star-formation tracers
(e.g. Peeters et al. 2004; Forster-Schreiber et al. 2004; Risal-
iti et al. 2006; Pope et al. 2008) and although the properties
of the PAH spectrum vary over small scales and are aﬀected
by factors such as metallicity and radiation ﬁeld hardness
(e.g. Roche et al. 1991; Engelbracht et al. 2008; Gordon et
al. 2008; Bendo et al. 2008) they are good gauges of star-
formation on galactic scales (Roussel et al. 2001; Kennicutt
et al. 2009; Treyer et al. 2010) and have been seen to corre-
late well with other star-formation tracers such as Hα (e.g
Kennicutt et al. 2009), [Ne II] (e.g. Ho & Keto 2007; Ship-
ley et al. 2013) and the total infrared luminosity (LIR; e.g.
Peeters et al. 2004; Brandl et al. 2006, Hanami et al. 2012).
Although PAHs are prevalent in star-forming galaxies, early
studies of AGN mid-IR spectra reported a lack of PAH fea-

tures around some AGN (e.g. Cutri et al. 1984; Aitken &
Roche 1985; Roche et al. 1991), which led to the idea that
PAHs might be destroyed by hard radiation from the AGN
(e.g. Aitken & Roche 1985; Voit 1992). However, subsequent
studies have shown that PAHs are common features in galax-
ies which host AGN and as such they have been routinely
employed as star-formation tracers in AGN hosts (e.g. Shi
et al. 2007; Lutz et al. 2008; Watabe et al. 2008; Rawlings
et al. 2013; Esquej et al. 2014).

Shi et al. measure the strength of the 7.7 and 11.3µm
PAH emission features in the PG QSO spectra used in this
work and derive the conversion factor between PAH lumi-
nosity and 8-1000µm total infrared luminosity attributed to
star-formation (LSFIR) for each PG QSO, by adopting an
SED template from the work of Dale et al. (2001) and Dale
& Helou (2002) that gives the closest PAH emission line ﬂux
at the redshift of the object; see Shi et al. (2007) for more
details. We note that the LSFIR/LPAH conversions in Shi et
al. are consistent with other works, e.g. Lutz et al. (2003);
Smith et al. (2007); Hern´an-Caballero et al. (2009). In cases
where both 7.7 and 11.3µm PAH features are detected, Shi
et al. (2007) use the 11.3µm PAH to derive LSFIR as its
uncertainty is lower than that of the 7.7µm PAH and it is
thought to be less susceptible to suppression by the AGN
radiation (e.g. see Smith et al. 2007; O’Dowd et al. 2009;
Hunt et al. 2010; Diamond-Stanic & Rieke 2010, Esquej et
al. 2014, Shi et al. 2014). In our ﬁnal sample (section 2.4),
there is only one source for which LSFIR is derived using the
7.7µm PAH instead of the 11.3µm one, as the latter is not
detected (in section 4.1.2 we examine the eﬀect this has on
our results).

2.3 Photometric data

We obtain archival and published photometry for the 58
z < 0.18 PG QSOs as follows: Palomar B-band photometry
(Shi et al. 2014; see also Schmidt & Green 1983), SDSS mag-
nitudes from the SDSS Photometric Catalog, Release 9 (Ahn
et al. 2012), 2MASS magnitudes from the 2MASS All-Sky
Catalog of Point Sources (Skrutskie et al. 2006), WISE mag-
nitudes from the AllWISE Source Catalog1, Spitzer /MIPS
data from Shi et al. (2014), ISO ﬂux densities (Haas et al.
2000; 2003), IRAS photometry from the IRAS point source
and faint source catalogues, AKARI 9 and 18µm data from
the AKARI /IRC mid-IR all-sky Survey and AKARI /FIS
All-Sky Survey Point Source ﬂuxes at 65, 90, 140, 160µm,
Herschel (Pilbratt et al. 2010)2/PACS (Poglitsch et al. 2010)
160µm ﬂux densities from Shi et al. (2014) and radio data
from Haas et al. (2003). The Herschel /SPIRE (Griﬃn et al.
2010) data are from the Herschel Science Archive, processed
by the SPIRE HIPE pipeline version 12 (Ott 2010). The
photometry was extracted at the source position using the
SUSSEXTractor task within HIPE (Savage & Oliver 2007,
Smith et al 2012, Pearson et al 2014). The SUSSEXtractor
task estimates the ﬂux density from an image smoothed with
a convolution kernel derived from the SPIRE beam FWHM.
In the cases where our targets were observed in the SPIRE
small map mode, the ﬂux density measured by SUSSEXtrac-
tor was veriﬁed using the SPIRE Timeline Fitter (Bendo et
al. 2013) which ﬁts a two dimensional elliptical Gaussian
function at the source position in the timeline data. The
agreement between the SUSSEXtractor and Timeline Fitter
ﬂux densities was found to be better than ∼5 per cent.

The detection statistics are as follows: 4 sources have
no signiﬁcant detections above 25µm (∼7 per cent of the
sample) and 5 sources have no signiﬁcant detections above
100µm (∼9 per cent). These 9 sources also have upper limits
in LSFIR; in total there are 21 sources with upper limits in
LSFIR (∼36 per cent of the sample).

We calculate rest-frame 5100˚A luminosities (νLν), by
interpolating between the SDSS bands. For the 9 objects
which do not have SDSS counterparts we interpolate be-
tween the Palomar B-band and the 2MASS J-band. To
convert to big blue bump luminosities (LBBB; 2keV–1µm
- Grupe et al. 2010), we use the Grupe et al. (2010) expres-
sion, log LBBB = (1.32±0.06)× log νLν,5100 −(10.84±2.21).
The range in νLν,5100 covered by our sample is three orders
of magnitude (1043 to 1046 erg/s; see Fig 2), translating to
log [LBBB (erg/s)]=44.5-48, and is a strong function of red-
shift. According to the local AGN optical luminosity func-
tion of Schulze et al. (2009), our sample covers the whole
luminosity range above L⋆, hence corresponds to the most
luminous nearby AGN.

2.4 The ﬁnal sample

Figure 3 shows LSFIR (the total
infrared luminosity at-
tributed to star-formation) as a function of LBBB. Note that

all bar one source have LBBB > LSFIR and for the major-
ity LBBB > 10 × LSFIR. This conﬁrms the suitability of this
sample for our study, i.e. sources where the AGN is more
powerful than the galaxies’ stellar output. For our analysis
we keep the sources with LBBB > 10 × LSFIR, where the
AGN is an order of magnitude more luminous than the lu-
minosity from star-formation. In this way we maximise the
ratio of AGN to stellar powered emission.

We remove radio-loud AGN from our ﬁnal sample as
their far-IR emission is contaminated by non-thermal pro-
cesses. Kellermann et al. (1989) examine the radio-loudness
of the PG sample, using a radio loudness criterion (R) de-
ﬁned as the ratio of radio ﬂux at 6 cm to optical ﬂux at
4400˚A. We take R=10 as the dividing line between radio-
quiet and radio-loud AGN. 4 sources are identiﬁed as radio-
loud.

The ﬁnal sample consists of 47, radio-quiet PG QSOs
at z < 0.18, with LBBB > 10 × LSFIR. Hereafter our analysis
involves only the ﬁnal sample.

3 METHOD AND RESULTS

3.1 Fitting QSO SEDs

We do the SED ﬁtting as follows:
from 22µm onwards
(just after the 18µm silicate feature) we ﬁt with a power-
law/greybody combination, whereas up to 22µm we interpo-
late logarithmically between the bands. The ﬁtting includes
the greybody (GB) function for the far-IR to describe the
emission from large grains in equilibrium, and a power-law
(PL) for the mid-IR to approximate the emission from hot
dust, combined at a critical frequency ν∗ (see also Blain et
al. 2003; Younger et al. 2009) as follows:

Fν ∝(

ν3+β

e(hν/kTdust)−1
ν α

if
if

ν < ν∗
ν > ν∗

(1)

where Fν is the ﬂux density, h is the Planck constant, c is
the speed of light in a vacuum, k is the Boltzmann constant,
Tdust is the temperature of the greybody function and β is
the emissivity — we adopt β=1.5, consistent with studies
of the far-IR emissivity of large grains (Desert, Boulanger
& Puget 1990; see also Boselli et al. 2012). At the critical
frequency ν∗ the slopes of the two functions are equal and
hence α=dlog GB/dlogν. We perform χ2 ﬁtting in order to
ﬁnd the best ﬁt GB/PL combination, with α, ν∗ and Tdust
as free parameters. The SEDs for all 47 sources in our ﬁnal
sample are shown in Fig. 4 normalised at 20µm, and also
individually in Appendix A. The small peak at 20µm is the
silicate feature in emission (see Shi et al. 2014). This is quite
common in unobscured QSOs, as the emission from silicates
in the inner part of the torus is visible (e.g. Siebenmorgen et
al. 2005, Sturm et al. 2005, Shi et al. 2006). Note that our
SEDs can be considered well-sampled up to about 500µm
(rest-frame).

3.2 Matching star-forming templates to QSOs

provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and
with important participation from NASA

We now assign a star-forming SED template to each PG
QSO. As these are low redshift systems, dust temperature
evolution is not signiﬁcantly at play (see Symeonidis et al.
2013a), hence it is appropriate to use SED templates for

nosity units, whereas the individual QSO SEDs (grey curves) are

nearby galaxies. To be consistent with how the LSFIR values
were derived in Shi et al. (2007; see section 2.2), we use the
Dale & Helou (2002; hereafter DH02) SED library. As in Shi
et al., we assign total infrared luminosities (LIR; 8–1000µm)
to the DH02 SED library using their 60/100µm colour and
the relation in Marcillac et al. (2006). Each SED template is
subsequently normalised to units of L⊙ by its LIR. For each
PG QSO, we chose the DH02 template whose LIR,templ is
closest to the QSO’s LSFIR calculated by Shi et al. (2007).
This is an important step as there is a correlation between
LIR and dust temperature (or SED peak) (e.g. Dunne et al.
2000; Dale et al. 2001; see also Symeonidis et al. 2013a), so
for each PG QSO we need to have the appropriate far-IR
shape of star-forming (SF) emission.

For each QSO, the corresponding DH02 template is
scaled by the factor LSFIR/LIR,templ. For the 17 sources (out
of 47; 36 per cent) which have a 3σ upper limit in LSFIR due
to low signiﬁcance PAH detections, we assume that their
LSFIR is equal to half the upper limit and scale the corre-
sponding DH02 templates by the factor LSFIR,lim/2
. This is
LIR,templ
a reasonable assumption given that they could in principle
have any LSFIR from 0 to LSFIR,lim; in section 3.4 we evalu-
ate the eﬀect that this has on our results.

3.3 The intrinsic AGN SED

Our PG QSO SEDs are broadband, hence to subtract the SF
DH02 templates which include spectral data in the mid-IR,
we resample the 2–30µm part of the rest-frame DH02 SED
into WISE ﬁlter-convolved luminosities at 3.4, 4.6, 12 and
22µm and interpolate between them. The average SF SED
is then subtracted from the average PG QSO SED from
5µm onwards, which is the onset of the dust continuum;
the residual we obtain is the average intrinsic or pure AGN

Figure 5. SEDs for the PG QSOs in our sample (black curves)
and their average (thick black curve), as well as the SF templates
(green dashed curves) and their average (thick green curve). The
intrinsic AGN SED is shown by the red dot-dashed curve and
is obtained by subtracting the thick green curve from the thick
black curve. In the ﬁrst two panels the sample is split into two
AGN luminosity bins: log [LBBB] < 45.5 and log [LBBB] > 45.5
and the last panel shows all QSOs together.

SED. We conﬁrm that we get the same intrinsic AGN SED if
instead we calculate the residual SED for each PG QSO and
subsequently average those. Note that our intrinsic AGN
SED can be considered well-sampled up to about 500µm
(rest-frame).

In Appendix 5, we test the method used to calculate the
average star-forming infrared SED for our sample of QSOs
(see this section and section 2.2), on 2 sets of pure starburst
galaxies with known far-IR SEDs. We ﬁnd that the average
far-IR SED of each set of starbursts is reproduced correctly,
and thus we have conﬁdence that this method accurately
predicts the average star-forming SED corresponding to the
input PAH measurements.

The matched SF templates and QSO SEDs are shown in
Fig. 5 split into two luminosity groups each covering about
1.5 dex in LBBB above and below log LBBB=45.5 and then
all together. Note that shortward of about 20µm the average
QSO SED is typically at least an order of magnitude brighter
than the average SF SED and the AGN entirely dominates
the broad-band emission, whereas longwards of 20µm there
is an additional contribution from the host galaxy. The lower
panel shows that the average luminosity from star-formation
is less than the average intrinsic AGN luminosity up to
∼100 µm and approximately equal to it thereafter, suggest-
ing that in some of these sources the whole SED is AGN-
dominated.

Fig. 6 compares the intrinsic AGN SEDs for the
two QSO luminosity bins,
log νLν,BBB < 45.5 and
log νLν,BBB > 45.5 normalised at 20µm, where the SEDs
change from AGN dominated to AGN+host. We note that
there is a small diﬀerence in the 1-10µm region between the
low luminosity and high luminosity QSOs of about 0.2 dex,
with the more luminous sources having a more pronounced
1-10µm bump in that wavelength range. Such a mid-IR
bump has been observed before in luminous AGN; e.g. Leip-

dence intervals shown as a shaded region), compared with the
one computed with the Chary & Elbaz 2001 (CE01) and Rieke
et al. 2009 (R09) SED templates — see section 3.3. Note that
throughout this work we use the one computed with the DH02
library, although the diﬀerence is small between the three SEDs.

ski et al. (2014) ﬁnd that a separate hot blackbody compo-
nent (T ∼1200 K) is needed to ﬁt the 1-10µm SED of their
QSO sample. Emission from the accretion disk is not sig-
niﬁcant past 1µm (e.g. Laor 1990; Collinson et al. 2015),
so this feature is likely caused by scattered and reprocessed
emission by dust (e.g. see also models by Fritz et al. 2006).
In contrast to the mid-IR, there is negligible diﬀerence in
the intrinsic SEDs of the lower and higher luminosity AGN
longward of 20µm. In the remainder of this work we use
the intrinsic AGN SED derived from the whole sample (see
lower panel of Fig. 5) and publish this in table 2.

To calculate the 68 per cent conﬁdence intervals on the
intrinsic AGN SED we bootstrap the residual SEDs of our
sample of 47 QSOs and hence re-derive an intrinsic AGN
SED 5000 times. Since LSFIR is used to assign a SF tem-
plate, which is in turn used to compute the residual SEDs,
the uncertainties on LSFIR (which are a combination of the
LSFIR/LPAH conversion factor uncertainties and PAH ﬂux
measurement errors) are propagated to the residual SEDs.
The distribution of observed residual SEDs is thus the result
of the convolution of the intrinsic distribution of residual
SEDs and the error distribution and is consequently broader
than the intrinsic distribution. Since the bootstrapping is
performed on the observed distribution of residual SEDs,
the resulting error on the mean has all random errors folded
in. We ﬁnd that the 1σ error on the pure AGN SED ranges
between 12 and 45 per cent as a function of wavelength (see
Fig. 12).

how the intrinsic AGN SED changes if we set LSFIR
to the minimum and maximum values, i.e. LSFIR=0 and
LSFIR=LSFIR,lim. We ﬁnd that the pure AGN SED changes
by up to 30 per cent in the 20–1000µm range, within the 68
per cent conﬁdence intervals we obtain from bootstrapping.

3.5 Eﬀect of SED library choice on the intrinsic

AGN SED

We assess the eﬀect of our choice of star-forming SED
library, by re-computing the intrinsic AGN SED with
two diﬀerent star-forming SED libraries, the Rieke et al.
(2009) templates and the Chary & Elbaz (2001) templates
(note that the Rieke et al.
library does not extend to
log [LIR/L⊙]<9.75, so we assign the log [LIR/L⊙]<9.75 tem-
plate to all our LSFIR < 1010 L ⊙ sources). Fig. 7 shows that
there is small diﬀerence in the resulting intrinsic AGN SED.

4 DISCUSSION

We found that the average intrinsic AGN emission in a sam-
ple of nearby QSOs dominates the broadband SED up to
about 100µm and is comparable to the average star-forming
emission thereafter. Before we examine the implications of
our results in sections 4.2 and 4.4, we dedicate section 4.1 to
a discussion regarding the star-forming luminosities in our
sample of PG QSOs.

4.1 Considerations on the star-forming

luminosities of QSO host galaxies

Recently, Petric et al. (2015) reported their results on the
far-IR emission of PG QSOs, ﬁnding an oﬀset between IR
SED-derived SFRs and PAH-derived SFRs, with the former
being systematically larger. This result is consistent with
ours, i.e. that the star-formation implied by PAHs does not
account for all the far-IR emission in nearby QSOs. Petric
et al. (2015) suggest that as well as the heating of dust by
the AGN, heating of the dust by old stars, and suppression
of the PAHs by the AGN may be important.

4.1.1 Could evolved stars contribute to dust heating?

In some nearby low-luminosity, low-SFR galaxies a fraction
of the far-IR emission is heated by the evolved stellar popu-
lation rather than young stars (e.g. Bendo et al. 2010; 2012;
2015). This suggests that for the 8 QSOs in our sample with
measured LSFIR < 1010 L⊙, scaling the templates according
to LSFIR might underestimate the normalisation of the tem-
plate with respect to the QSO SED. Nevertheless, the LSFIR
of these QSOs is very low compared to the average LSFIR
of the sample, thus even increasing the normalisation by a
factor of 3 (corresponding to an extreme case whereby only
30 per cent of the total IR luminosity is due to dust heated

4.1.2 How well do PAHs trace star-formation in AGN

host galaxies?

PAH molecules are not expected (or observed) to survive
in the vicinity of the AGN, where they are directly illumi-
nated by its hard radiation ﬁeld (Siebenmorgen, Kr¨ugel &
Spoon 2004). However, there has been a long-standing de-
bate about whether PAHs are suppressed further out in the
host galaxies of AGN, where the ultraviolet radiation ﬁeld
is dominated by stars. In theory X-rays from the AGN are
expected to destroy PAHs as a consequence of photoion-
ization, the relevant transition being the carbon K edge at
0.288 keV in the soft X-rays (Voit 1992). The PAH survival
condition suggested by Voit (1992) is that PAHs containing
&50 carbon atoms can survive at ∼1 kpc from an AGN of
X-ray luminosity νLν =1044erg s−1 if they are shielded from
the AGN by column densities > 1022 cm−2. Typically, AGN
tori have column densities more than an order of magnitude
larger than this (e.g. Risaliti, Maiolino & Salvati 1999; Buch-
ner et al. 2014) and their covering factors are 50 per cent or
more (e.g. Maiolino & Rieke 1995, Dwelly & Page 2006). In
addition, observational evidence suggests that AGN tori are
aligned with the galaxy plane (e.g. Maiolino & Rieke 1995;
Lagos et al. 2011). As a result, PAHs in star-forming regions
are likely to be well shielded by the torus along the majority
of lines of sight in the galaxy.

Some studies argue that the smaller PAH molecules re-
sponsible for the shorter wavelength PAH features might
be suppressed in the host galaxies of AGN, but there is
strong empirical evidence that this is not the case for the
11.3 µm feature. For example, Smith et al. (2007) ﬁnd that
in their Spitzer study of 59 nearby galaxies, some that host
AGN have lower ratios of 7.7 µm to 11.3 µm PAH emission
than those that do not, and with a more pronounced trend
closer to the nuclei of the galaxies. O’Dowd et al. (2009)
show a similar trend of reduced 7.7 µm PAH emission in
some of the AGN-hosting members of their sample of 92
z ∼ 0.1 galaxies. They argue that the molecules responsible
for the 7.7 µm emission are likely to be susceptible to de-
struction by X-rays or shocks from the AGN, but that the
11.3 µm emission is likely to come from larger molecules that
are more resilient. Subsequently, Diamond-Stanic & Rieke
(2010) studied a sample of 35 Seyfert galaxies and showed
that while the shorter wavelength PAH features are sup-
pressed in some of these objects, the 11.3 µm emission obeys
the same relationship with [Ne II] as purely star-forming ob-
jects, implying that it is a robust tracer of star formation
rate regardless of the presence of an AGN. Finally Shipley
et al. (2013) conclude that the AGN do not aﬀect PAHs on
galaxy-wide scales based on the lack of any trend between
the LPAH(7.7)/LPAH(11.3) ratio and the AGN luminosity or
hardness of the radiation ﬁeld.

Only one object (PG 0838+770) in our sample of nearby
PG QSOs has LSFIR value based on the 7.7 µm PAH rather
than the 11.3 µm feature. Noting the potential suppression of
7.7 µm PAH features by AGN, we have checked the extent to
which the inclusion of this object aﬀects our intrinsic AGN
SED by re-computing the SED with this object excluded

from the sample. We ﬁnd that the intrinsic AGN changes
by less than 1.4 per cent; see Fig. 8.

Ground-based studies using 8–10 m telescopes have al-
lowed the PAH emission from the host galaxies of nearby
AGN to be studied at much higher spatial resolution than
the space-based studies. Recently, Esquej et al. (2014) exam-
ined the PAH emission from a sample of 29 Seyfert galaxies
and found no evidence for the suppression of the 11.3 µm
emission even within a few tens of pc from the nucleus.
Alonso-Herrero et al. (2014) ﬁnd in their study of six lo-
cal AGN that 11.3 µm emission is seen at 10 pc from the
nucleus, suggesting that the molecules responsible for this
emission feature are robust to AGN destruction even in the
innermost regions of the host galaxy. In a follow up case
study of the nearby Seyfert Mrk 1066, Ramos-Almeida et
al. (2014) explicitly calculate that when the nuclear contin-
uum is subtracted, the equivalent width of the 11.3µm PAH
emission in the inner region of this galaxy is consistent with
that seen in star-forming regions, supporting the validity of
the 11.3 µm emission as a tracer of the star-formation rate
in AGN host galaxies.

On the other hand, one study has raised concerns about
the use of the 11.3 µm feature in AGN hosts. LaMassa et
al. (2012) ﬁnd that a number of sources in their sample of
Seyfert 2 galaxies show abnormally large ratios of 7.7 µm
to 11.3 µm PAH emission. LaMassa et al. (2012) interpret
these ratios as evidence for suppression of the 11.3 µm PAH
emission by the AGN, though extinction oﬀers an alterna-
tive explanation for large 11.3 µm / 7.7 µm PAH ratios, as
noted by Diamond-Stanic & Rieke (2010). We compare the
distribution of the LPAH(7.7)/LPAH(11.3) ratio in our sam-
ple of PG QSOs with that of the local star-forming galaxy

the features is detected are shown. Squares are objects with both
features detected, upper limits are for the objects for which the
7.7µm feature is not detected and the lower limit is for the ob-

ues seen in star-forming galaxies.

samples of Brandl et al. (2006); LaMassa et al. (2012); Stier-
walt et al. (2014), and ﬁnd them to be broadly consistent
with only 5 PG QSOs having elevated LPAH(7.7)/LPAH(11.3)
ratios, higher than the typical values seen in star-forming
galaxies (i.e.
log [LPAH(7.7)/LPAH(11.3)]> 0.7). We check
the extent to which inclusion of the 5 objects with el-
evated LPAH(7.7)/LPAH(11.3) (PG 0838+770, PG 1115+407,
PG 1310-108, PG 1535+547, PG 2130+099) aﬀects our re-
sults, by re-computing the intrinsic AGN SED with these
objects excluded. The resulting SED diﬀers at most by 5.1
per cent from that derived from the whole sample; see Fig
8. Finally we inspect the 7.7 µm/11.3 µm PAH luminosity
ratio as a function of AGN luminosity (at 5100˚A) for our
sample of QSOs (Figure 9; note only objects with at least
one PAH detection are shown). We see no trend between the
LPAH(7.7)/LPAH(11.3) ratio and AGN luminosity for the PG
QSOs with elevated LPAH(7.7)/LPAH(11.3). Whatever the rea-
son is for the elevated 7.7 µm/11.3 µm PAH ratios in these 5
objects, they do not have a signiﬁcant impact on the results.
We also investigate the concern raised by Petric et al.
(2015), that the 11.3 PAH detection rate is lower for the
most IR-luminous AGN, which might arise as a result of
AGN suppression of the 11.3µm PAH emission. For our
sample of QSOs, we show in Fig. 10 the distributions in
L5−6µm luminosity (i.e. the integrated luminosity in the 5–
6µm range), for sources which have 11.3µm PAH detections
and those that do not. The values of L5−6µm were taken
from Shi et al. (2007). We ﬁnd no oﬀset in the two distribu-
tions, indicating that the 11.3µm PAH detection rate is not
dependent on AGN luminosity.

eﬀect of the AGN on the 11.3 µm PAH emission, and hence
the intrinsic AGN SED appears to be likewise robust to any
such eﬀect.

4.2 Comparison with other AGN SEDs

In Fig. 11 we compare the average SED of our sample of
QSOs (i.e. AGN+host, also shown in Fig. 4) to the aver-
age QSO SEDs from Elvis et al. (1994), Richards et al.
(2006), Shang et al. (2011) and the type I QSO and type
II QSO templates from the SWIRE template library3, Pol-
letta et al. 2006; 2007). Our QSO SED agrees well with the
SWIRE type I QSO SED, particularly in the far-IR/submm,
whereas it has less far-IR/submm power than the type II
QSO SWIRE SED, likely due to a diﬀerent amount of host
galaxy contribution. On the other hand, the composite SEDs
of Elvis et al. (1994), Richards et al. (2006) and Shang et
al. (2011) fall short of our SED in the 60-300µm region.
However, note that their data do not probe the submm and
hence the SEDs are extrapolated in that wavelength range.
Most of the Elvis et al. QSOs are not signiﬁcantly detected
at IRAS /100µm and a large fraction (∼25 per cent) are
not signiﬁcantly detected at IRAS /60µm. Similarly, only a
handful of the Richards et al. QSOs have 70µm data. With
respect to the Shang et al. radio-quiet SED, again their data
probe shorter rest-frame wavelengths both as a consequence
of their sample extending to much higher redshift and the
lack of far-IR photometry for about half of the sources.

Fig. 12 compares the intrinsic AGN SED extracted here
to the SEDs from Netzer et al. (2007) and Mullaney et al.
(2011), both of which are classed as pure AGN SEDs. The
intrinsic AGN SED (in νLν) we derive in this work can be
considered ‘ﬂat’ within 0.2 dex up to about 20µm, with a
subsequent slow drop oﬀ of ∼0.4 dex from 20 to 60µm and
∼0.3 dex from 60 to 100µm. Fig. 12 shows that the Net-
zer et al. and Mullaney et al. SEDs are much steeper in
the far-IR than ours, particularly the former whose emis-
sion at 70µm is more than half a dex lower. The Netzer
et al. AGN SED was derived for a subsample of PG QSOs
which were studied as part of the Spitzer QUASAR and
ULIRG evolution study (QUEST; Schweitzer et al. 2006).
Netzer et al. produce a template starburst SED by nomal-
ising the SEDs of the starburst-dominated ULIRGs in their
sample at 60 µm and then taking the mean at every wave-
length. To determine the intrinsic AGN SED, they subtract
the starburst template from the average PG QSO SED, ﬁrst
scaling it according to the assumption that most of the 50-
100 µm emission from the PG QSOs is due to star forma-
tion. Note that our study suggests that this assumption is
not valid. Mullaney et al. (2011) estimate the form of an
intrinsic AGN SED by decomposing the observed SEDs of
the sources in their sample into host-galaxy and intrinsic
AGN components by simultaneously ﬁtting the mid-IR spec-
tra and IRAS photometry. Their method however already
assumes an intrinsic AGN component which is then used
during spectral decomposition, created by combining the
mid-IR spectra of AGN-dominated sources in the 6-25µm
range with a modiﬁed blackbody above a wavelength λBB,

Figure 10. The distribution in QSO luminosity (integrated in
the 5-6µm region; values taken from Shi et al. 2007) for our sam-
ple, split into sources which have PAH detections (red ﬁlled his-
togram) and sources which have no PAH detections (blue his-
togram).

The SEDs constructed separately for the QSOs with
log [LBBB] above and below 45.5 (Figs 5 and 6), oﬀer another
opportunity to examine the possibility that the 11.3 µm
PAH emission is suppressed by the AGN. If the AGN were
suppressing the 11.3 µm emission, we would expect a larger
eﬀect in the higher luminosity subset: the stronger AGN
radiation ﬁeld would produce stronger suppression of the
11.3 µm emission, so that the SFR would be systematically
underestimated by a larger degree in the more luminous
QSOs, which would translate to a larger ﬂux at long wave-
lengths (> 70 µm) in the intrinsic AGN SED for the more-
luminous QSOs than for the less-luminous QSOs. Instead,
the shapes of the intrinsic AGN SEDs for the higher and
lower luminosity subsamples are almost indistinguishable
beyond 20µm (Fig. 6), and hence no evidence for the sup-
pression of 11.3 µm PAH emission by the AGN can be found
in the comparison.

To summarise, a number of studies in the literature
provide strong evidence that the 11.3 µm PAH oﬀers a
robust measure of star formation in AGN host galaxies,
even in the circum-nuclear regions. Only four of our sam-
ple of QSOs show the elevated 7.7 µm/11.3 µm PAH ratios
which LaMassa et al. (2012) attribute to AGN-suppression
of 11.3 µm PAH emission, and excising these objects from
our sample has no signiﬁcant impact on our intrinsic AGN
SED. There is no trend in our sample between elevated
7.7 µm/11.3 µm PAH ratios and AGN luminosity; indeed,
most of the sources in our sample show 7.7 µm/11.3 µm PAH
ratios which are consistent with those found in star-forming
galaxies. We also ﬁnd no evidence for AGN suppression of
the 11.3 µm emission when we compare the higher and lower
AGN-luminosity subsets of our sample. The star-formation
contribution to the average SED appears to be robust to any

where λBB is allowed any value between 25 µm and 100µm.
The drawbacks of both Netzer et al. and Mullaney et al.
methods is that they make a priori assumptions about the
balance of AGN and stellar emission when calculating the
intrinsic AGN SED. In contrast we argue that our method

of extracting the pure AGN emission is more robust as it
is not based in any inherent assumptions on the balance of
AGN and stellar emission or the shape of the intrinsic AGN
component. The intrinsic AGN SED derived here maintains
a higher level of far-IR emission compared to the Mullaney

and a ratio of 150 between the outer and inner radius of the
dust distribution. The best-ﬁt S15 model has an inner torus
radius of 15.45×1017 cm (maximum in the library), a cloud
volume ﬁlling factor of 1.5 per cent, 0 optical depth in the
individual clouds, maximum optical depth in the disk mid-
plane (1000), and a viewing angle of 43 degrees measured
from the z-axis.

We see that the HK10 and F06 AGN models fail to
reproduce the AGN power in the submm, whereas the S15
model does a better job, matching the mid to far-IR part of
our SED up to about 200µm. This shortfall is likely due to
the limited extent of the dust distribution in the formulation
of these models and hence caution must be applied when
using AGN models in SED multi-component ﬁtting, as it
could lead to overestimated SFRs.

4.4 Implications for measuring star-formation

rates in AGN host galaxies

Our work suggests that for AGN hosts, particularly those
of powerful AGN, the contribution from the AGN to the
infrared/submm needs to be taken into account when cal-
culating properties such as SFRs. In Fig. 14 we use 3 lu-
minous QSO samples from the literature to demonstrate
the level of correction that would be required when mea-
suring the star-forming emission in luminous AGN. We use
type 1 radio-quiet QSOs with robust submm/mm detections
at 1.7 < z < 2.9 from Lutz et al. (2008), 24µm-selected
broad-line QSOs at 1.7 < z < 3.6 from Dai et al. (2012)
and X-ray absorbed and submm- luminous type I QSOs at
1.7 < z < 2.8 from Khan-Ali et al. (2015). The 60µm lu-
minosity of each source (νLtot
ν,60) is shown as a function of
νLAGN
ν,5100, using their published values or values obtained by
private communication. The shaded region is our pure AGN
SED, its width corresponding to the 20 per cent error on the
νLν,60/νLν,5100 ratio calculated by bootstrapping. Using our
pure AGN SED, we subtract the expected AGN contribu-
tion to νLtot
ν,60, obtaining the luminosity at 60µm which can
solely be attributed to star-formation (νLSF
ν,60). Note that in
many cases νLSF
ν,60 is up to an order of magnitude lower than
νLtot
ν,60. Fig. 14 illustrates that one could assume a negligible
AGN contribution only if the total galaxy emission at 60µm
is more than a factor of two higher than the intrinsic AGN
power measured in the optical, i.e. νLtot
ν,5100>2. In
fact, the AGN contribution cannot be simply ignored even
at λ > 200 µm; the third panel of Fig. 5 shows that in our
sample, the average AGN SED is at least comparably lu-
minous to the average SF SED at all wavelengths suggest-
ing that, in some galaxies hosting luminous AGN, there is
no ‘safe’ broadband photometric observation (. 1000µm)
that can be assumed free from AGN contamination. As-
suming an M82 SED (from the SWIRE SED library) where
LIR,8−1000µm=1.7νLν,60, broadly speaking, the AGN contri-
bution could be ignored if the total IR emission from a given
galaxy is more than a factor of 4 higher than the intrinsic
AGN power at 5100˚A.

ν,60/νLAGN

A further point to note is that submm colours are not
necessarily good indicators of whether the galaxy is AGN
or SF dominated in the far-IR/submm. Although the pure
AGN SED and the SEDs of star-forming galaxies are dis-
tinctly diﬀerent at .100 µm, they decay with a similar rate
in the submm (e.g. see Fig. 5), as in both cases we are into

et al. and Netzer et al. SEDs. This far-IR excess likely stems
from AGN heated dust in the host galaxy (at kpc scales),
a component which is not accounted for in the Mullaney et
al. and Netzer et al. SEDs.

4.3 Comparison with AGN models

In ﬁgure 13 we compare our intrinsic AGN SED to torus
models from Honig & Kishimoto (2010, hereafter HK10) and
accretion disk+torus models from Fritz et al. (2006, here-
after F06) and Siebenmorgen et al. (2015, hereafter S15).
Our aim is to examine whether the aforementioned widely
used AGN models could reproduce our pure AGN SED in
the far-IR/submm, resulting in the appropriate normali-
sation of a star-forming far-IR/submm component during
multi-component SED ﬁtting (e.g. see Hatziminaoglou et al.
2008 for multi-component SED ﬁtting). The HK10 library of
torus models is ﬁt onto our pure AGN SED in the 3–100µm
region, whereas the F06 and S15 libraries are ﬁt from 0.4
to 100µm as they include the accretion disk component. In
Fig. 13, we examine how well the best ﬁt model (minimum
χ2) from each library can reproduce the far-IR, λ >100 µm,
emission of our intrinsic AGN SED.

The best ﬁt HK10 model has 0 inclination angle (type-I
AGN), a 30 degree half opening angle of the torus, power-
law index alpha of 0 (the lower alpha is the redder the SED),
the highest number of clouds (N=10) which gives maximum
IR emission and the highest optical depth τ =80 increasing
the ﬂux at longer wavelengths. From the F06 library the
best ﬁt model is for a face-on AGN, has the largest opening
angle, no variation of the dust density in the vertical direc-
tion, a value of 10 for the equatorial optical depth at 9.7µm

the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the modiﬁed blackbody emission
from dust in the host galaxy. As a result we would expect
that all SEDs would have consistent submm colours. Indeed
we ﬁnd that the rest-frame Herschel /SPIRE 500/350µm and
350/250µm colours of our pure AGN SED are within the
range probed by nearby spiral galaxies (Boselli et al. 2010).
Redshifting the AGN SED to z = 2, the observed SPIRE
colours now coincide with the peak in the observed distri-
bution of colours in SPIRE- selected galaxies and AGN as
shown in Hatziminaoglou et al. (2010). This implies that the
rest-frame submm colours (or observed submm colours at
low redshift ) of AGN hosts are not an indication of whether
AGN or star-formation is the dominant energy source in the
submm.

We next examine the implications of our pure AGN
SED for the statistical studies of star-formation in X-ray
selected AGN from Rosario et al (2012; 2013) and Harri-
son et al. (2012). Rosario et al. (2012; 2013) examine the
star-forming properties of X-ray selected AGN hosts, using
the 60µm luminosity as a proxy for star-formation and as-
suming a negligible contribution from the AGN at 60µm;
in Fig. 15 we show the average luminosities for the Rosario
et al. samples as well as the functional ﬁts to them. Also
plotted is the region in parameter space that corresponds to
the intrinsic AGN emission in their work, derived by using
the AGN SEDs of Mullaney et al. (2011) and Netzer et al.
(2007). The shaded region represents the L60/LAGN ratio
that stems from our intrisic AGN SED. As in Rosario et

minosity from Rosario et al. (2012; crosses and dotted lines) and

shown in the legend. The region bound by the dashed lines is the
Rosario et al. estimate of a pure AGN contribution. The shaded
region is the pure AGN region derived in this work, its width

(see section 4.4) together with the 20 per cent uncertainty in
νLν,60/LAGN that we calculate from bootstrapping.

al. (2012; 2013), to convert from νLν,5100 to LAGN, where
LAGN is the bolometric AGN luminosity, we use the Netzer
and Trakhtenbrot (2007) relation LAGN=f ×νLν,5100, where
f = 7. However as Netzer & Trakhtenbrot (2007) point out,
estimates for f in type 1 AGN are in the range 5-13 (e.g.,
Elvis et al. 1994; Kaspi et al. 2000; Netzer 2003; Marconi et
al. 2004). The range in νLν,5100 to LAGN conversion factors
quoted above are incorporated into the width of the intrin-
sic AGN region together with the 20 per cent uncertainty in
νLν,60/LAGN that we calculate from bootstrapping.

Note that our pure AGN SED shifts the νLν,60/LAGN
ratio to higher values, i.e. the AGN contribution at 60µm
is now 2–10 times higher than what is assumed in the work
of Rosario et al. (2012; 2013). Rosario et al. interpret their
results as two diﬀerent mechanisms at play regarding the
black hole/SF connection, originally proposed by Shao et
al. (2010): they suggest that for low AGN luminosities the
SFR does not correlate with AGN power, so secular mech-
anisms drive the black hole and galaxy growth, whereas
at high AGN luminosities there is a correlation, a sign of
the increasing importance of major-mergers in driving both
the growth of super-massive black holes and star-formation.
Looking at Fig. 15 and the location of the pure AGN region
derived in this work, we arrive at a diﬀerent interpretation
of the Rosario et al. results: we propose that the diﬀerence
in νLν,60/LAGN between the low and high luminosity AGN
can be understood simply as an increase in the AGN con-
tribution. In Fig. 15 it is evident that one can only travel
so far in the x-direction before the pure AGN region (grey
shaded region) is met, so for a given level of νLν,60, low lu-

5 SUMMARY & CONCLUSIONS

We have explored the question of whether and how much the
AGN contributes to the far-IR emission from a galaxy. For
our purposes we used a sample of 47 broad line, luminous
(L5100 >1043.5 erg/s), z < 0.18, radio-quiet QSOs from the
Palomar Green survey. Taking advantage of archival data
in the 0.4-500µm range and PAH-derived estimates of star-
forming luminosities, we removed the stellar component in
these sources’ energy budget using the 11.3µm PAH feature
in the QSOs’ mid-IR spectra, in order to obtain an average
intrinsic or pure AGN SED in the optical–submm wave-
length range. The 1σ uncertainty on the intrinsic AGN SED
ranges between 12 and 45 per cent as a function of wave-
length and is a combination of PAH ﬂux measurement errors
and the uncertainties related to the conversion between PAH
luminosity and star-forming luminosity.

Our main conclusions are:

• In our sample of QSOs, the average AGN contribution
to the total energy budget is > 95 per cent shortwards of
20µm, 60 − 95 per cent in the 20–100µm range and at all
wavelengths thereafter (at least up to 1000µm) it is com-
parable to the contribution from star-formation. This im-
plies that for some galaxies hosting powerful AGN, the entire
optical-submm broadband SED can be AGN dominated and
hence there is no ‘safe’ waveband (at λ < 1000µm) that can
be used in calculating SFRs without subtracting the AGN
contribution.

• Our intrinsic AGN SED maintains a higher level of far-
IR emission compared to other such SEDs available in the
literature. This far-IR excess likely stems from AGN heated
dust in the host galaxy (at kpc scales), a component which
had been previously ignored.

• Using AGN torus models in AGN/SF SED decompo-
sition could potentially underestimate the far-IR contribu-
tion of the AGN and lead to overestimated SFRs, as many
of these models are built with a limited extent in the dust
distribution.

• The shape of the far-IR component of the intrinsic AGN
SED does not vary with AGN luminosity and our AGN tem-
plate can be considered applicable to any samples of galax-
ies hosting a luminous (L5100 or LX(2−10keV) &1043.5 erg/s)
AGN.

• Statistical studies of star-formation in AGN host galax-
ies need to incorporate a correction for the AGN con-
tribution, irrespective of the waveband used to calculate
SFRs. This is particularly crucial for luminous (L5100 or
LX(2−10keV) &1043.5 erg/s) AGN. For ease, and broadly
speaking, the AGN contamination could be neglected if the
intrinsic AGN power at 5100˚A is more than a factor of 2
lower than the galaxy’s 60µm luminosity and more than
factor of 4 lower than the total IR emission (8–1000µm) of
the galaxy.

minosity AGN can have a higher fraction of star-formation
contribution than their higher luminosity counterparts. In
other words, at any given redshift, and hence mean SFR,
the more luminous AGN will on average have higher νLν,60
simply due to increased AGN emission at 60µm. Our re-
sults indicate that the apparent correlation between νLν,60
and LAGN in high luminosity AGN is driven by the intrinsic
AGN emission at those wavebands, also corroborated by the
convergence of the νLν,60–LAGN trends (dotted lines) onto
the intrinsic AGN region (grey shaded region) at high LAGN.
Figure 16 shows the results from Harrison et al. (2012),
who examined the average SFR in a sample of luminous X-
ray selected AGN at z = 1 − 3. The SFRs presented are
not corrected for AGN contamination and the parameter
space assigned to the AGN contribution is shown. Following
their method, we also calculate a region of AGN contamina-
tion, ﬁrst using our pure AGN SED to obtain the rest-frame
luminosity at 83µm (250µm observed at z = 2) and then
converting it to an SFR using the Elbaz et al. (2011) main
sequence template and the Kenniccutt (1998) relation. To
convert from νLν,5100 to LX we use the Maiolino et al. (2007)
relation, log LX(2 − 10keV) = 0.721 × log(νLν,5100) + 11.78,
where the units are in erg/s. The region of AGN contam-
ination derived using our pure AGN SED extends further
than the one shown in Harrison et al., implying a correc-
tion in the star-formation rates would be necessary for the
most luminous AGN. Indeed correcting for AGN contami-
nation might bring these results in agreement with Page et
al. (2012) who ﬁnd that the most luminous AGN do not lie
in the most highly star-forming hosts (see also Barger et al.
2015).

APPENDIX C: TESTING THE METHOD OF SFR
ESTIMATION ON STARBURST GALAXIES

As explained in section 2.1, we take the value of LSFIR for
each QSO from Shi et al. (2007). Shi et al. measure the
strength of the 7.7 and 11.3µm PAHs in the QSO spec-
tra and derive the conversion factor between PAH ﬂux
and 8-1000µm total infrared luminosity attributed to star-
formation (LSFIR) for each PG QSO, by adopting an SED
template from the Dale & Helou (2002) library that gives the
closest PAH ﬂux at the redshift of the object. Here we test
this method on some samples of nearby staburst galaxies us-
ing the 11.3µm PAH, which is the feature used in deriving
LSFIR for the vast majority of our sample.

(i) Following the method of Shi et al. (2007), we as-
sign total
infrared luminosities (LIR; 8–1000µm) to the
Dale & Helou (2002; DH02) SED library using the
60/100µm colour and the relation in Marcillac et al. (2006),
log (f60/f100)=0.128 log LIR-1.611. Each SED template is
subsequently normalised to units of L⊙ by its LIR.

(ii) We measure the luminosity of the 11.3 PAH (single
feature) in each DH02 template by integrating under the fea-
ture in the 10.9–11.8µm region and subtracting the contin-
uum in the same region (the continuum baseline estimated
by interpolating between 10.9–11.8µm). We also measure the
luminosity of the PAH 11.3 complex (as in Stierwalt et al.
2014) by integrating in the 10.9–13.1µm wavelength range.
(iii) For the ﬁrst comparison we use starburst galaxies
from Brandl et al. (2006) and Pereira-Santaella et al. (2010),
28 sources in total (we refer to this as sample A). We take the
11.3µm single feature PAH luminosities published in these
papers and IRAS far-IR ﬂuxes from NED, the latter simply
converted to rest-frame luminosities, with no K-corrections
required as these are nearby galaxies. For the second com-
parison we use 31 starburst galaxies from GOALS (we refer
to this as sample B) which have published Spitzer /MIPS
ﬂuxes in U et al. (2012) and 11.3 complex PAH ﬂuxes in
Stierwalt et al. (2014). Again these are nearby galaxies so
no K-corrections are necessary. Note that all galaxies are
larger than the Spitzer /IRS slit, so we correct the published
PAH luminosities according to the factors tabulated in these
papers.

(iv) Each starburst galaxy is then assigned the DH02
template which has the closest PAH luminosity to the true
PAH luminosity of the source (single feature for sample A,
complex feature for sample B). We then average the tem-
plates matched to sample A and B separately and compare
with the average true far-IR SEDs built using the IRAS and
Spitzer photometry. The 1σ uncertainties are calculated by
boostrapping the matched SED templates for each sample.
The results are shown in Fig. 4 and 5. There is excellent
agreement between the true Spitzer or IRAS -derived SEDs
and the average SEDs derived using our method from the
PAH measurements.

Figure 4. The average template SED of sample A (28 sources;
Brandl et al. 2006, Pereira-Santaella et al. 2010; solid curve and
dotted curves for the 1σ uncertainty calculated by bootstrapping)
compared with the true average luminosities of this sample from
IRAS photometry at 12, 25, 60 and 100µm (green crosses). There
is excellent agreement between the true IRAS -derived average
SED and the average SED derived using our method from the
PAH measurements.

Figure 5. The average template SED of sample B (31 sources; U
et al. 2012 and Stierwalt al. 2014; solid curve and dotted curves
for the 1σ uncertainty calculated by bootstrapping), compared
with the true average luminosities of this sample from Spitzer
photometry at 8, 24, 70 and 160µm (green crosses). There is ex-
cellent agreement between the true Spitzer -derived average SED
and the average SED derived using our method from the PAH
measurements.

tor Thales Alenia Space (Cannes), and including As-
trium (Friedrichshafen) responsible for the payload mod-
ule and for system testing at spacecraft level, Thales Ale-
nia Space (Turin) responsible for the service module, and
Astrium (Toulouse) responsible for the telescope, with in
excess of a hundred subcontractors. PACS has been de-
veloped by a consortium of institutes led by MPE (Ger-
many) and including UVIE (Austria); KU Leuven, CSL,
