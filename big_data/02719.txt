Bikei Homology

Sam Nelson∗

Jake Rosenﬁeld †

We introduce a modiﬁed homology and cohomology theory for involutory biquandles (also known as
bikei). We use bikei 2-cocycles to enhance the bikei counting invariant for unoriented knots and links as
well as unoriented and non-orientable knotted surfaces in R4.

Keywords: bikei, involutory biquandles, cocycle invariants, bikei homology
2010 MSC: 57M27, 57M25

1 Introduction

In [9], Joyce introduced an algebraic structure known as quandles which can be used to deﬁne computable
invariants of oriented knots and links (see also [13]). For unoriented knots and links, a special case known as
involutory quandles or kei (ȼ) has been studied going back to Takasaki [16]. In [7] quandles were generalized
to racks and in [8] racks were generalized to biracks. In [1], the involutory case of biquandles was considered,
now known as bikei (5ȼ).

In [8] a homology theory for racks and biracks was introduced in which the 2-cocycle condition corresponds
to the Reidemeister III move for a certain way of associating 2-chains to crossings in an oriented rack-colored
knot or link diagram. In [3] a subcomplex was deﬁned corresponding to Reidemeister I moves in the quandle
case, leading to the theory of quandle 2-cocycle invariants of knots and links. In [2] this construction was
generalized to the biquandle case. In [5] the degenerate subcomplex was generalized for the case of non-
quandle racks, in each case deﬁning a new family of cocycle enhancements of counting invariants.

In this paper we introduce a generalization of biquandle homology to the case of bikei which we call
bikei homology. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review the basics of bikei and the bikei
counting invariant. In Section 3 we introduce bikei homology and cohomology. In Section 4 we deﬁne the
bikei cocycle enhancements of the bikei counting invariant for unoriented knots and provide some examples.
In Section 5 we extend the bikei cocycle invariant to unoriented (including non-orientable) knotted surfaces
in R4. In Section 6 we ﬁnish with some questions for future work.

2 Bikei

We begin with a deﬁnition (see [1, 6] for more).
Deﬁnition 1. A bikei is a set X with two binary operations ∗ , ∗ : X × X → X satisfying for all x, y, z ∈ X

(i) x∗ x = x∗ x,

(ii)

(x∗ y)∗ y = x
(x∗ y)∗ y = x
x∗ (y ∗ x) = x∗ y
x∗ (y ∗ x) = x∗ y

and

(iii) (Exchange Laws)

(x∗ y)∗ (x∗ y) = (x∗ z)∗ (y ∗ z)
(x∗ y)∗ (x∗ y) = (x∗ z)∗ (y ∗ z)
(x∗ y)∗ (z ∗ y) = (x∗ z)∗ (y ∗ z)

(iii.i)
(iii.ii)
(iii.iii).

Example 1. Let X be a set and σ : X → X any involution, i.e., any map such that σ2 = IdX . Then X is
a bikei with operations

x∗ y = x∗ y = σ(x)

known as a constant action bikei.
Example 2. Let Λ = Z[t, s]/(t2, s2, (t − 1)(s − 1)) be the quotient of the ring of two-variable polynomials
with integer coeﬃcients such that s2 = t2 = 1 by the ideal generated by (1 − t)(1 − s). Then any Λ-module
X is a bikei with operations

x∗ y = tx + (s − t)y,

x∗ y = sx

known as an Alexander bikei. To see this, we can verify the axioms:

(i) x∗ x = tx + (s − t)x = sx = x∗ x,

(ii)

and

(iii)

(x∗ y)∗ y = s2x
= x,
(x∗ y)∗ y = t(tx + (s − t)y) + (s − t)y
= t2x + (ts − t2 + s − t)y
= x + (1 − t)(1 − s)y
= x,
x∗ (y ∗ x) = tx + (s − t)(sy)
= tx + (s2 − st)y
= tx + (1 − st)y
= tx + (1 − t2 + s − t)y
= tx + (s − t)y
= x∗ y
x∗ (y ∗ x) = sx
= x∗ y,

and

(x∗ y)∗ (x∗ y) = s(sx)
= (x∗ z)∗ (y ∗ z),
(x∗ y)∗ (x∗ y) = s(tx + (s − t)y)
= t(sx) + (s − t)(sy)
= (x∗ z)∗ (y ∗ z)
(x∗ y)∗ (z ∗ y) = t(tx + (s − t)y) + (s − t)(tz + (s − t)y)
= t2x + t(s − t)y + t(s − t)z + (s − t)2y
= t2x + t(s − t)z + (s − t)(t + s − t)y
= t(tx + (s − t)z) + (s − t)(sy)
= (x∗ z)∗ (y ∗ z)

Deﬁnition 2. A map f : X → Y between bikei is a bikei homomorphism if we have

f (x∗ y) = f (x)∗ f (y)

and f (x∗ y) = f (x)∗ f (y)

for all x, y ∈ X. A bijective bikei homomorphism is a bikei isomorphism.

2

Example 3. Let X = {x1, . . . , xn} be a ﬁnite set. We can represent any bikei structure on X with an
n× 2n block matrix M encoding the operation tables of ∗ and ∗ by setting Mj,k = l and Mj,k+n = m where
xj ∗ xk = xl and xj ∗ xk = xm for j, k ∈ {1, . . . , n}. For example, there are two nonisomorphic bikei on the
set X = {x1, x2}, given by the matrices

and

Example 4. Let D be an unoriented knot or link diagram representing an unoriented knot or link K and let
G be a set of generators corresponding to semiarcs in D. The set W of bikei words in G is deﬁned recursively
by the rules

(i) x ∈ G ⇒ x ∈ W and
(ii) x, y ∈ W ⇒ x∗ y, x∗ y ∈ W .
Then the fundamental bikei of D, denoted BK(D), is the set of equivalence classes of W under the equivalence
relation generated by the bikei axioms and the crossing relations in D, i.e.

We express such a bikei with a bikei presentation, i.e. an expression of the form

BK(D) = (cid:104)g1, . . . , gn | r1, . . . , rn(cid:105)

where {g1, . . . , gn} are generators and {r1, . . . , rn} are crossing relations, with the bikei axiom relations
understood. It is easy to check that Reidemeister moves on D induce Tietze moves on presentations, and
hence the isomorphism type of the fundamental bikei is an invariant of unoriented knots and links; hence,
we will generally write BK(K) instead of BK(D).

Given an unoriented knot or link K represented by a diagram D and a ﬁnite bikei X, the bikei counting

X (K) is the cardinality of the set of bikei homomorphisms f : BK(K) → X, i.e.
Z

invariant Φ

X (K) = |Hom(BK(K), X)|.
Z

Φ

Every such homomorphism assigns an element of X to each generator of BK(K), which we can think of as
coloring the corresponding semiarc in D. Conversely, an assignment of elements of X to the semiarcs in D
determines a bikei homomorphism f : BK(K) → X only if it satisﬁes the crossing relations at every crossing.
Hence, we can compute the bikei counting invariant of an unoriented knot or link by counting bikei colorings
of any diagram of D which satisfy the crossing relations.
Example 5. Consider the bikei X = Z2 = {0, 1} with x∗ y = x∗ y = x + 1. As a coloring rule, this says
that each time we go through a crossing either over or under, we switch from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0. Then for any

3

knot, there are exactly two X-colorings, determined by our choice of starting color on a choice of semiarc.

In the next section, we will enhance the bikei counting invariant with cocycles in a bikei homology theory

to get a stronger invariant following [3, 2] etc, but using bikei and unoriented diagrams.

3 Bikei Homology

Deﬁnition 3. Let X be a bikei and set Cn(X; A) = A[X n] for an abelian group A. The birack boundary
map ∂n : Cn(X; A) → Cn−1(X; A) is deﬁned on generators (cid:126)x = (x1, . . . , xn) by

n(cid:88)

(−1)k−1(cid:0)∂0

∂((cid:126)x) =

k((cid:126)x)(cid:1)

k((cid:126)x) − ∂1

where

k=1

∂1
k(x1, . . . , xn) = (x1, . . . , xk−1, xk+1, . . . , xn) and
k(x1, . . . , xn) = (x1 ∗ xk, . . . , xk−1 ∗ xk, xk+1 ∗ xk, . . . , xn ∗ xk)
∂2

and extended to Cn(X; A) by linearity. The resulting homology and cohomolgy groups Hn(X; A) =
Ker ∂n/Im ∂n−1 and H n = Ker δn+1/Im δn where δnφ = φ∂n are the birack homology and cohomology
groups of X with coeﬃcients in A.

In previous work [3, 2, 4], the subset C D

n (X; A) of Cn(X; A) generated by elements (x1, . . . , xn) with
xj = xj+1 for some j = 1, . . . , n − 1 was identiﬁed as the degenerate subcomplex. Then the biquandle
homology and cohomology groups, also known as the Yang-Baxter homology and cohomology groups, are the
homology and cohomology groups of the quotient complex C B

n (X; A) = Cn(X; A)/C D

n (X; A).

We now introduce a slight generalization for bikei.

Deﬁnition 4. Let X be a bikei. The bikei degenerate subgroup of Cn(X; A), denoted C BD
generated by chains of the forms
(0) (x) − (x∗ y) and (x) − (x∗ y),

n (X; A), is

(i) (. . . , x, x, . . . ),
(ii) (x, . . . , x, y, . . . , y) − (x∗ y, . . . , x∗ y, y ∗ x, . . . , y ∗ x),
(iii) (x, . . . , x, y, . . . , y) + (x, . . . , x, y ∗ x, . . . , y ∗ x), and
(iv) (x, . . . , x, y, . . . , y) + (x∗ y, . . . , x∗ y, y, . . . , y).

where in (i) the dots can represent any entries, while in (ii)-(iv) the ﬁrst k entries are equal and the last
n − k entries are equal.

Proposition 1. For a bikei X, (C BD

n , ∂n) forms a subcomplex.

4

Proof. The fact that ∂n((. . . , x, x, . . . )) ∈ C BD
n−1(X; A) is standard but easy to check: suppose the repeated
entries x, x are in positions k and k + 1. Then for j < k and j > k + 1, the terms in the boundary have
repeated entries of the form x, x and x∗ xj, x∗ xj and thus belong to C BD
n−1(X; A), so we only need to check
the j = k and j = k + 1 cases. We have

∂1
k((x1, . . . , x, x, . . . , xn)) = (x1, . . . , xk−1, x, xk+2, . . . , xn)
∂1
k+1((x1, . . . , x, x, . . . , xn)) = (x1, . . . , xk−1, x, xk+2, . . . , xn)
k((x1, . . . , x, x, . . . , xn)) = (x1 ∗ x, . . . , xk−1, x∗ x, xk+2 ∗ x, . . . , xn ∗ x)
∂2
k+1((x1, . . . , x, x, . . . , xn)) = (x1 ∗ x, . . . , xk−1, x∗ x, xk+2 ∗ x, . . . , xn ∗ x)
∂2

and since x∗ x = x∗ x, we have

k − ∂2
(∂1

k − ∂1

k+1 + ∂2

k+1)((. . . , x, x, . . . )) = 0.

Now, consider generators of type (ii); if n > 3, then the boundary is a diﬀerence of chains of type (i), so
we only need to check the n = 3 case. There are two possibilities which are not already covered by condition
(i): (x, x, y) − (x∗ y, x∗ y, y ∗ x) and (x, y, y) − (x∗ y, y ∗ x, y ∗ x). We compute
∂((x, x, y) − (x∗ y, x∗ y, y ∗ x)) = (x, y) − (x∗ y, y ∗ x) − (x∗ x, y ∗ x) + ((x∗ y)∗ (x∗ y), (y ∗ x)∗ (x∗ y))
−(x, y) + (x∗ y, y ∗ x) + (x∗ x, y ∗ x) − ((x∗ y)∗ (x∗ y), (y ∗ x)∗ (x∗ y))
+(x, x) − (x∗ y, x∗ y) − (x∗ y, x∗ y) + ((x∗ y)∗ (y ∗ x), (x∗ y)∗ (y ∗ x))

= (x, x) − 2(x∗ y, x∗ y) + ((x∗ y)∗ (y ∗ x), (x∗ y)∗ (y ∗ x)) ∈ C BD

(X)

and
∂((x, y, y) − (x∗ y, y ∗ x, y ∗ x)) = (y, y) − (y ∗ x, y ∗ x) − (y ∗ x, y ∗ x) + ((y ∗ x)∗ (x∗ y), (y ∗ x)∗ (x∗ y))
−(x, y) + (x∗ y, y ∗ y) + (x∗ y, y ∗ x) − ((x∗ y)∗ (y ∗ x), (y ∗ x)∗ (y ∗ x))
+(x, y) − (x∗ y, y ∗ y) − (x∗ y, y ∗ x) + ((x∗ y)∗ (y ∗ x), (y ∗ x)∗ (y ∗ x))

= (y, y) − 2(y ∗ x, y ∗ x) + ((y ∗ x)∗ (x∗ y), (y ∗ x)∗ (x∗ y)) ∈ C BD

(X).

Next, consider generators of type (iii). There are two possibilities: (x, x, y) + (x, x, y ∗ x) and (x, y, y) +

(x, y ∗ x, y ∗ x). We compute

∂((x, x, y) + (x, x, y ∗ x)) = (x, y) + (x, y ∗ x) − (x∗ x, y ∗ x) − (x∗ x, (y ∗ x)∗ x)
−(x, y) − (x, y ∗ x) + (x∗ x, y ∗ x) + (x∗ x, (y ∗ x)∗ x)
+(x, x) + (x, x) − (x∗ y, x∗ y) − (x∗ (y ∗ x), x∗ (y ∗ x)

= 2(x, x) − 2(x∗ y, x∗ y) ∈ C BD

(X)

2

and

∂((x, y, y) + (x, y ∗ x, y ∗ x)) = (y, y) + (y ∗ x, y ∗ x) − (y ∗ x, y ∗ x) − ((y ∗ x)∗ x), (y ∗ x)∗ x)

−(x, y) − (x, y ∗ x) + (x∗ y, y ∗ y) + ((x∗ y)∗ x), (y ∗ x)∗ (y ∗ x))
+(x, y) + (x, y ∗ x) − (x∗ y, y ∗ y) − (x∗ (y ∗ x), (y ∗ x)∗ (y ∗ x))

= 0.

Next, consider the generators of type (iv). There are two possibilities: (x, x, y) + (x∗ y, x∗ y, y) and

(x, y, y) + (x∗ y, y, y). We compute

∂((x, x, y) + (x∗ y, x∗ y, y)) = (x, y) + (x∗ y, y) − (x∗ x, y ∗ x) − ((x∗ y)∗ (x∗ y), y ∗ (x∗ y))

−(x, y) − (x∗ y, y) + (x∗ x, y ∗ x) + ((x∗ y)∗ y, (x∗ y)∗ y))
+(x, x) + (x∗ y, x∗ y) − (x∗ y, x∗ y) − ((x∗ y)∗ y, (x∗ y)∗ y)

= 0

5

and

∂((x, y, y) + (x∗ y, y, y)) = (y, y) + (y, y) − (y ∗ x, y ∗ x) − (y ∗ (x∗ y), y ∗ (x∗ y)
−(x, y) − (x∗ y, y) + (x∗ y, y ∗ y) + ((x∗ y)∗ y, y ∗ y)
+(x, y) + (x∗ y, y) − (x∗ y, y ∗ y) − ((x∗ y)∗ y), y ∗ y)

= 2(y, y) − 2(y ∗ x, y ∗ x) ∈ C BD

(X).

2

Finally, when n = 2 the degenerate chains (x, x), (x, y) + (x∗ y, y) and (x, y) + (x, y ∗ x) have boundary

∂((x, x)) = (x) − (x∗ x) − (x) + (x∗ x) = 0,

∂((x, y) + (x∗ y, y)) = [(y) − (y ∗ x) − (x) + (x∗ y)]

+[(y) − (y ∗ (x∗ y)) − (x∗ y) + ((x∗ y)∗ y]

= [(y) − (y ∗ x) − (x) + (x∗ y)] + [(y ∗ x) − (y) − (x∗ y) + (x)]
= 0,

and

∂((x, y) + (x, y ∗ x)) = [(y) − (y ∗ x) − (x) + (x∗ y)]

+[(y ∗ x) − ((y ∗ x)∗ x) − (x) + (x∗ (y ∗ x))]

= [(y) − (y ∗ x) − (x) + (x∗ y)] + [(y ∗ x) − (y) − (x) + (x)]
= 0

while the chains (x, y) − (x∗ y, y ∗ x) have boundary

∂((x, y) − (x∗ y, y ∗ x)) = [(y) − (y ∗ x) − (x) + (x∗ y)]

−[(y ∗ x) − ((y ∗ x)∗ (x∗ y)) − (x∗ y) + ((x∗ y)∗ (y ∗ x)]
= [(y) − (y ∗ x) − (x) + (x∗ y)] − [(y ∗ x) − (y) − (x∗ y) + (x)]
= 2[(y) − (y ∗ x)] − 2[(x) − (x∗ y)] ∈ C BD

(X; A).

Hence, ∂n(C BD

n (X; A)) ⊂ C BD

n−1(X; A) and (∂, C BD

n (X; A)) is a subcomplex.

Deﬁnition 5. Let X be a bikei. Then for each n ≥ 2, set C BK
ing homology and cohomology groups H BK
groups of X.

(X; A) and H n

n

n (X; A) = Cn(X; A)/C BD

n (X; A). The result-
BK(X; A) are the bikei homology and cohomology

Since C BD

n (X; A) = C D

n (X; A) for n ≥ 3, we have:

n (X; A) = H BK

Theorem 2. For n > 3, the biquandle and bikei homology and cohomology groups for a bikei X coincide,
i.e. H B
Proposition 3. If X is a bikei in which x∗ y = x for all x, y (that is, a kei) or a bikei in which x∗ y = x
for all x, y, then H 2

BK(X; F) = {0} for any ﬁeld F.

B(X; A) = H n

(X; A) and H n

BK(X; A).

n

Proof. In either of the listed cases, the degenerate group includes all cochains of the form φ(x, y) + φ(x, y) =
2φ(x, y), so we must have 2φ(x, y) = 0. Then if our coeﬃcients belong to a ﬁeld, we must have φ(x, y) = 0
for all x, y ∈ X.

Further calculations lead us to propose the following conjecture:

Conjecture 1. The free part of H 2

BK(X; Z) is {0} for all ﬁnite bikei X.

6

At ﬁrst, it may seem like bikei homology is completely trivial, but it turns to have nontrivial torsion part

in at least some cases.
Proposition 4. Let X be an Alexander bikei structure on an abelian group A, i.e., a choice of units t, s ∈ A
such that (1 − s)(1 − t) = 0 deﬁning operations

x∗ y = tx + (s − t)y

and x∗ y = sx.

Then a linear map φ(x, y) = ax + by deﬁnes a bikei cocycle in H 2

BK(X; A) if and only if we have

b = −a and 2a = a(1 + s) = a(1 + t) = a(1 − t) = a(s − t − 2) = 0.

We will call such a cocycle a linear Mochizuki bikei cocycle since it is similar to Mochizuki cocycles for

Alexander quandles [14].
Proof. We check the bikei cocycle conditions. First, φ(x, x) = ax + bx = (a + b)x = 0 requires b = −a. Then
setting φ(x, y) = a(x − y), the other degeneracy conditions yield

φ(x, y) − φ(x∗ y, y ∗ x) = 0
a(x − y) − a(tx + (s − t)y − sy) = 0
a(1 − t)x − a(−1 + s − t − s)y = 0
a(1 − t)x + a(1 + t)y = 0

and we must have a(1 − t) = a(1 + t) = 0,

φ(x, y) + φ(x∗ y, y) = 0
a(x − y) + a(tx + (s − t)y − y) = 0
a(1 + t)x + a(−1 + s − t − 1)y = 0
a(1 + t)x − a(s − t − 2)y = 0

so we also need a(s − t − 2) = 0, and

φ(x, y) + φ(x, y ∗ x) = 0
a(x − y) + a(x − sy) = 0
a(2)x + a(−1 − s)y = 0
2ax − a(1 + s)y = 0

so we need 2a = a(1 + s) = 0. Finally, we check the cocycle condition:

φ(x, y) + φ(y, z) + φ(x∗ y, z ∗ y) = φ(x, z) + φ(x∗ z, y ∗ z) + φ(y ∗ x, z ∗ x)

a(x − y) + a(y − z) + a(tx + (s − t)y − sz) = a(x − z) + a(tx + (s − t)z − ty − (s − t)z) + a(sy − sz)

a(1 − t)x + a(s − t)y − a(1 + s)z = a(1 + t)x + a(s − t)y − a(1 + s)z

so no further conditions are required. Hence the given list of conditions is necessary and suﬃcient.
Example 6. Let X = Z8 and set s = 3, t = 1 and a = 4. Then we have (1 − s)(1 − t) = 2(0) = 0, so X is a
bikei with operations

x∗ y = x + 2y

and x∗ y = 3y.

Then we verify that

2(4) = 4(1 + 3) = 4(1 + 1) = 4(1 − 1) = 4(3 − 1 − 2) = 0

and φ(x, y) = 4x − 4y is a nonzero bikei cocycle.

4 Cocycle Enhancements

Let φ ∈ H 2

Our motivation for bikei homology comes from the desire to extend cocycle enhancements of the bikei
counting invariant to unoriented knots and links, and in particular to non-orientable knotted surfaces in R4.
BK(X; A) and let D be an unoriented knot or link diagram representing a knot or link K. For
any bikei homomorphism f : BK(K) → X, let Df denoted the X-coloring of D determined by f . Then at
each crossing we assign a Boltzmann weight φ(x, y) where x and y are the bikei colors on the under and over
crossing semiarcs when the crossing is positioned as depicted, with the overstrand going from upper right to
lower left.

Then the Boltzmann weight for the bikei coloring f is the sum of the Boltzmann weights φ(x, y) at each
crossing C in the set C(Df ) of crossings in diagram Df ,

BW (f ) =

φ(x, y).

(cid:88)

C∈C(Df )

The bikei 2-cocycle conditions are precisely the conditions required to ensure that the Boltzmann weight
is unchanged by Reidemeister moves. The degeneracy conditions insure that the Boltzmann weight is well-
deﬁned and give invariance under Reidemeister I and II moves:

The 2-cocycle condition

δ2(φ(x, y, z)) = φ(∂2(x, y, z))

= φ(−(y, z) + (x∗ y, z ∗ y) + (x, z) − (y ∗ x, z ∗ x) − (x, y) + (x∗ y, y ∗ z))
= 0

guarantees equivalence under Reidemeister III moves:

Thus, we have

Deﬁnition 6. Let X be a ﬁnite bikei and φ ∈ H 2
by a diagram D, the 2-cocycle enhanced bikei counting invariant of K is the multiset

BK(X). Then for any unoriented knot or link K represented

or its generating function

X (D) =

X (D) = {BW (Df ) | f ∈ Hom(BK(K), X)}
Φφ,M

uBW (Df )

f∈Hom(BK(K),X)

By construction (and also see [2] etc.), we have

Theorem 5. If X is a ﬁnite bikei, φ ∈ H 2
by Reidemeister moves, then

BK(X) and D and D(cid:48) are unoriented knot or link diagrams related

X (D(cid:48))
As with many knot invariants, we can extend Φφ

and Φφ

X (D) = Φφ

X to the case of virtual knots and links by simply ignoring

Example 7. Let X be the Alexander bikei from example 6 and consider the virtual Hopf link V H below.

We obtain system of coloring equations

x∗ y = x
y ∗ x = y

⇒ x + 2y = x
3y = y

⇒ 2y = 0

so a pair (x, y) yields a valid coloring for y ∈ {0, 4} and no further conditions on x ∈ Z8, so there are 16
X-colorings. Each coloring has a Boltzmann weight of

(cid:26) 4 x odd

0 x even

at the single crossing, so the invariant is Φφ

X (V H) = 8 + 8u4.
We can compare this with the case of the usual Hopf link

where we obtain coloring equations 3x = x + 2y and 3y = y + 2x, both reducing to 2x = 2y. Then there are
sixteen colorings, and each has Boltzmann weight φ(x, y) + φ(y, x) = 4(x − y) + 4(y − x) = 0, yielding an
invariant value of Φφ
X is not determined by the counting
invariant and hence is a proper enhancement.

X (H) = 16. In particular, this demonstrates that Φφ

5 Invariants of Knotted Surfaces
We can also deﬁne bikei cocycle invariants for knotted unoriented (including non-orientable) surfaces in R4
in the same way. Recall that a marked graph diagram, also called a marked vertex diagram, is a diagram
with ordinary crossings together with saddle crossings

representing saddle point. More precisely, given a knotted surface Σ ⊂ R4, we move the maxima in the
x4 direction to the hyperplane x4 = 1, the minima to x4 = −1 and the saddle points to x4 = 0. Then
the intersection of Σ with x4 = 0 is a link diagram with singularities at the saddle points; we indicate the
direction of the saddle with a small bar. Such a diagram represents a knots closed surface if both resolutions
of the saddle yield unlinks; otherwise, the diagram represents a cobordism between the links represented by
the smoothed diagrams. Two such diagrams represent ambient isotopic knotted surfaces if and only if they

10

are related by a sequence of the Reidemeister moves together with the Yoshikawa moves

See for instance [11, 12] for more.
In [15], bikei colorings and counting invariants of marked graph diagrams were considered. Speciﬁcally,
all of the semiarcs meeting at a saddle crossing determine the same generator of BK(Σ) and must have the
same color. We now observe that we can enhance the bikei counting invariant with bikei 2-cocycles in the
same way as we did for knots and links in R3. Speciﬁcally, we have
Deﬁnition 7. Let X be a ﬁnite bikei and φ ∈ H 2
BK(X). Then for any unoriented knotted surface Σ
represented by a marked vertex diagram D, the 2-cocycle enhanced bikei counting invariant of Σ is the
multiset

X (D) = {BW (Df ) | f ∈ Hom(BK(Σ), X)}
Φφ,M

(cid:88)

uBW (Df )

f∈Hom(BK(Σ),X)

or its generating function

Φφ

X (D) =

We then have

Theorem 6. If X is a ﬁnite bikei, φ ∈ H 2
related by Yoshikawa moves, then

BK(X) and D and D(cid:48) are unoriented marked vertex diagrams

Φφ,M
X (D) = Φφ,M

X (D)

and Φφ

X (D) = Φφ

X (D).

Proof. This is a matter of verifying that the Yoshikawa moves do not change the Boltzmann weight of
a bikei colored marked vertex diagram. Moves VI and VII do not involve non-saddle crossings, so these
cannot change the Boltzmann weight, and in move V all semiarc colors are the same, so both sides of the
move contribute φ(x, x) = 0. For moves IV and VIII, both sides of the move contribute degenerate chains:
φ(x, y) + φ(x, y ∗ x) on both sides of move IV, and 2φ(y, x) + 2φ(y, x∗ y) on the left and 2φ(x, y) + 2φ(x, y ∗ x)

on the right of move VIII.

Analogously to the case of knotted and linked curves, including virtual crossings in marked vertex diagram
yields virtual knotted surface diagrams, with the rule that two such diagrams are equivalent if related by
Reidemeister moves, Yoshikawa moves and the detour move, i.e., redrawing an arc with only virtual crossings
as another arc with only virtual crossings and the same endpoints. See [10] for more.

Example 8. Let X again be the Alexander bikei from example 6 and consider the virtual marked vertex
diagram D below, representing a virtual linked surface with one sphere component and one projective plane
component.

X-labelings of D are given by pairs (x, y) ∈ (Z8)2 satisfying 3y = y, i.e. 2y = 0, with x = x + 2y imposing
no further conditions on x:

Hence we have 16 X-colorings as in example 7; each coloring has Boltzmann weight 4(x − y) + 4(y − y), so
colorings with odd x contribute u4 while colorings with even x contribute 1 to the invariant, and we again
have Φφ

X (K) = 8 + 8u4.

6 Questions

We conclude with a few questions for future research.

How does bikei homology generalize to other cases like involutory biracks, virtual bikei and parity bikei?
Is conjecture 1 true, and if not, what is the smallest counterexample? What about shadow colorings, either
in the marked vertex style or broken surface diagram style? It seems that additional degeneracies might be
required for shadow colorings, depending on the shadow coloring operation; what should these be?
