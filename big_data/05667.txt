Memoryless time evolutions are ubiquitous in nature but often correspond to a resolution-induced approxi-
mation, i.e. there are correlations in time whose effects are undetectable. Recent advances in the dynamical
control of small quantum systems provide the ideal scenario to probe some of these effects. Here we exper-
imentally demonstrate the precise induction of memory effects on the evolution of a quantum coin (qubit) by
correlations engineered in its environment. In particular, we design a collisional model in Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) and precisely control the strength of the effects by changing the degree of correlation in the
environment and its time of interaction with the qubit. We also show how these effects can be hidden by the
limited resolution of the measurements performed on the qubit. The experiment reinforces NMR as a test bed
for the study of open quantum systems and the simulation of their classical counterparts.

Introduction

Markov processes are deﬁned as those in which the future of a system bears no correlation to its past. Such behavior is found
in the description of phenomena as far apart as nuclear ﬁssion, the decay of an electronically excited atom, the growth of bacteria
colonies or rabbit populations and the compound interests that dictate our debts, to name a few [1]. In many situations, however,
these time evolutions prove to be no more than a resolution-induced approximation, i.e. the interaction with external degrees of
freedom (here called environment) produces correlations in the dynamics, but in a way that is too weak to be observed. Most
of the times, such small deviations are either harmless and/or useless. However, there are meaningful counterexamples of both
cases. For instance, many modern applications, such as the generation of large cryptographic keys or statistical sampling, rely on
random number generators [2]. Testing the independence of events in these devices is essential to guarantee the safety or fairness
of these applications where even the tinniest correlations may be exploited. At the same time, controllable non-Markovian
evolutions in small quantum systems have been thought of as promising tools for quantum information processing [3–7].

Markovian processes exist both in discrete time steps or as a continuous time evolution. A broadly used tool to discretize
continuous Markovian dynamics are the so-called collisional models. In these models, the continuous stochastic process is
replaced by a stroboscopic sequence formed by a series of discrete time steps deﬁned, each one, by a collision between the
system of interest and one of the particles forming its environment. The most famous application of collisional models in
physics is the description of Brownian motion. In open quantum systems, collisional models have been extensively used as a
test bed to investigate the details of system-environment interactions and the conditions under which non-Markovian dynamics
arises [8–17]. Provided system and environment are initially uncorrelated, the evolution of the system ρ after j collisions with
the environment ρenv is given by

ρ → ρ(cid:48)

2 ...U †

j−1U †

j(cid:105) ,

where Trenv denotes the partial trace over the environmental degrees of freedom and Ui is a global unitary operation due to the
i-th collision. These models are simple to describe, easy to compute and have been recently simulated in optical setups where
one degree of freedom of the photon is used as the quantum system and extra ones play the role of the environment [18–26].

In this paper, we implement a collisional model in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) to investigate with high resolution
the subtle non-Markovian evolution of a qubit subjected to the action of a structured and fully quantized external environment.
This experimental technique has been very successful in the study of quantum information processes and in proofs of quantum
principles as may be seen on [27–30]. Here, the environment is composed of independent qubits that are initially correlated
among themselves and collide, one at a time, with the target. We characterize non-Markovianity by calculating the Trace
2Tr|ρ1(t)−ρ2(t)| between two different states of the qubit as a function of time. It is well established
Distance D(ρ1(t),ρ2(t)) = 1
that in a quantum stochastic evolution, D(ρ1(t + τ),ρ2(t + τ)) > D(ρ1(t),ρ2(t)) implies non-Markovian behavior [31]. The
experiment features only two time steps because these are enough to establish all the properties we want to discuss. We measure
D(ρ1(t),ρ2(t)) after each collision as a function of the degree of correlation in the initial state of the environment and also as a
function of the duration of each collision. Both quantities inﬂuence how much the dynamics deviates from a Markov process.

FIG. 1: a) The nuclear spins of the atoms of ﬂuorine of the C2F3I molecule are the qubits. Two of them represent the environment and the
other one is the system. Their interaction is showed in this pictorial representation of our collisional model. The action of the environment on
the system’s qubit is represented by the two boxes and the demon. In the ﬁrst collision, the demon will toss a coin and will decide if he will
operate either eiησx or eiησy on the system ρ(0). Afterwards he can still decide if the operation done in the second collision is correlated or not
with the previous one, resulting in the state ρ(2). b) A quantum circuit that describes the experiment. The environment is prepared in state ρenv
and will serve as the control qubit for the controlled operation that happen on the state of the system ρ. After that a quantum state tomography
is performed on the ﬁrst particle in order to determine the state of the system.

Results

We encoded the system-environment state in a sample of triﬂuoroiodoethylene (C2F3I). The NMR experiment was performed
using a 500 MHz Varian spectrometer with the used sample diluted (∼ 1%) in deuterated acetone (containing 97% of deuterium).
A single molecule of C2F3I contains three atoms of ﬂuorine with nuclear spin-1/2, each of them representing a qubit. One of
the atoms will be regarded as the system and the other two as the environment. These spins interact with each other and with
applied magnetic ﬁelds as well. We designed the experiment to implement the operations represented in the quantum circuit of
Fig. 1: the ﬁrst qubit, top line in the circuit, represents the system and the other lines are the qubits of the environment. The two
1−q
2 (|01(cid:105)(cid:104)01| +|10(cid:105)(cid:104)10|)
qubits of the environment are initially prepared in a correlated state ρenv =
where “0” means spin up and “1” means spin down. In each collision, the state of the system undergoes a random-walk type
of evolution, changing conditionally to the environment: environmental spin up induces a rotation in a certain direction (say, x),
whereas environmental spin down induces a rotation in the orthogonal direction (y). This situation can be summed up by the
unitary transformation U = eiησx ⊗|0(cid:105)(cid:104)0| + eiησy ⊗|1(cid:105)(cid:104)1| where | j(cid:105)(cid:104) j| represents the internal state of an environmental particle
and the exponentials dictate the system’s rotations.

In a NMR experiment the signal of each ﬂuorine spin can be distinguished and singled manipulated. The natural Hamiltonian

where ω0n and ωr are the natural resonance frequency and the frequency of the rotating reference frame of the n-th spin,
respectively. The ﬁrst term represents the interaction of the spins with the static magnetic ﬁeld applied along the z direction and
the second term represents the interaction between the three spins, with Jkm being the exchange integral. Here, Ii
α is the spin
operator for the i-th spin, which for spin-1/2 corresponds to the Pauli matrix (σα) divided by 2. The physical parameters of
our molecule are given in Methods. Since the individual chemical shifts of each spin place them far apart, i.e. their resonance
frequencies are separated enough (|ω0k − ω0m| (cid:29) Jkm), the Ising coupling approximation was considered here [33]. In the NMR
experiment the spins also interact with oscillating magnetic ﬁelds that can be turned on and off at any frequency and different
amplitudes, named radio frequency pulses (r f ). These are responsible for the system control, and its interaction can de described
by the Hamiltonian

Hr f = ω1(t)(cid:2)In

(3)

where ω1(t) deﬁnes the pulse modulation and duration, and φ stands for its phase. The radio frequency pulses are used to perform
rotations on the individual spins and by properly choosing these rotations, the quantum circuit from Fig. 1 can be implemented,
as described in Methods.
The experiment was performed for two different initial states of the system, ρ1(0) = |0(cid:105)(cid:104)0| and ρ2(0) = |1(cid:105)(cid:104)1| (eigenstates
of σz) and for the environment prepared in different states with different degrees of correlation q (q = 0, 0.15, and 0.25). The

FIG. 2: The trace distance, D(ρ1(t),ρ2(t)) = 1
with time is a trace of non-Markovianity. a) The plots show the dependence of ∆D with the strength of each collision η for different values of
the correlation parameter q (0 for the solid blue line, 0.15 for the dashed orange line and 0.25 for the dash-dotted green line). q = 0 means that
the two collisions were totally anti-correlated. b) Detail of the ∆D curve for η < 0.01 and q = 0. In both plots the error bars were estimated
√
taking into account every possible error source, as discussed in Ref. [37]. This led to the error determining the Bloch vector of the quantum
state of δr = 5× 10−4, independent of the direction. By propagating this error, the error in D(ρ1(t),ρ2(t)) is given by δD = δr/
2.

theoretical analysis shows that for q equals 0 and 0.15 these are the states that maximize ∆D for the chosen dynamics. For
q = 0.25 there is a better pair of initial states but the eventual gain in ∆D (a factor of ∼ 3) still lies within the current error bar.
Using the r f pulses, the ﬁrst and the second collisions were implemented, resulting in the system state ρ1(1) (ρ2(1)) and ρ1(2)
(ρ2(2)) , respectively. After each run, full state tomography [32] was performed in the system.
Figure 2 shows the change in distance between the two initial states of the system after one and two collisions ∆D =
D(ρ1(2),ρ2(2))− D(ρ1(1),ρ2(1)), as a function of the strength of each collision η and for different degrees of correlation q
of the environmental state. For large enough interactions (larger η) and anti-correlation in the environment (smaller q), the
collisions clearly generate a non-Markovian dynamics in the system (∆D > 0). The phenomenon, witnessed by the increase in
∆D also reﬂects a backﬂow of information from the environment to the system as time progresses.
It is also worth noticing that, as the non-Markovian effects induced by the collisions get smaller, either due to weaker collisions
(small values of η) and/or environmental correlations (q → 1/2), the uncertainties in ∆D due to the lack of resolution of the
measurements become of the same order of ∆D. This is true even for the strongest anti-correlation possible, q = 0. In this case,
∆D, a sufﬁcient but not necessary condition for non-Markovianity, does not provide a conclusive answer anymore, even though
theory still predicts its vanishing only asymptotically with both parameters η → 0 or q → 1/2. Our resolution to conclusively
guarantee non-Markovianity was limited to ∆D ∼ 3.5× 10−4.

Discussions

Non-markovian dynamics of collisional models has been experimentally investigated in linear optical setups [18–26] where
the environment is simulated by semi-classical degrees of freedom. Usually, such experiments are performed in the photon
counting regime and strong system-environment coupling. Our results put in evidence, in a controllable way, the role played by
environmental correlations in the non-Markovian dynamics of quantum systems and also show how such effects may be hidden
by the external noise brought in by unavoidable measurement uncertainties. We have shown how NMR can be exploited to
study quantum dynamics of open systems using a bona ﬁde quantum environment. NMR also presents a great advantage over
previously used platforms when it comes to the versatility to design and control different environmental states and the precision
to probe very small memory effects in the dynamics of quantum systems. For example, here we have observed variations of the
√
Trace Distance of the order of 0.05%, a gain of at least two orders of magnitude over the typical optical experiments based on

measurements of the polarization of photons. In photon polarization measurements, the signal-to-noise ratio is less than
where N is the number of photons in each measurement. Such gain in precision can be essential, for example, if one would like to
use a similar setup to test very small time correlations of black boxes such as quantum or classical random number generations,
cryptographic machines and alike. Furthermore, one can also explore the capacity to dynamically change the environment during
the interaction with the system and to directly interfere with the system during its time evolution in order to test and investigate
very recent theoretical results in the ﬁeld, such as the ones respectively published in [13] and [36].

We consider a qubit ρ that interacts with an environment from which it is initially decoupled. The interaction consists of
consecutive collisions with qubits of the environment. During each collision, the system undergoes with equal probability an
evolution eiησy or eiησx controlled by the internal state of the corresponding environmental particle. The map that describes
the state of the system after collision one is Λ10(·) = 1
2 [eiη1σx (·)e−iησx + eiη1σy(·)e−iη1σy]. All the effects we are interested in
can be observed with only two collisions described, in our case, by the general map Λ20(·) =

2 [eiη2σyeiη1σx (·)e−iη1σxe−iη2σy + eiη2σxeiη1σy(·)e−iη1σye−iη2σx ]], where q deﬁnes their degree
of correlation: for q = 1 (q = 0) the collisions are totally correlated (anti-correlated). One possible way to generate this
2 (|00(cid:105)(cid:104)00| + |11(cid:105)(cid:104)11|) +
evolution is to consider two qubits as the environment prepared in the following state ρenv =
1−q
2 (|01(cid:105)(cid:104)01| + |10(cid:105)(cid:104)10|).
2 (|01(cid:105) + |10(cid:105)) will
render the same system evolution). The interaction in each collision is described by a unitary transformation given
by Uη = eiησx ⊗ |0(cid:105)(cid:104)0| + eiησy ⊗ |1(cid:105)(cid:104)1|, which works as a conditional operation. The resulting state after one colli-
sion will be ρ(1) = Λ10(ρ(0)) = Trenv(cid:104)(Uη1 ⊗ 1)(ρ(0)⊗ ωenv)(U †
η1 ⊗ 1)(cid:105) = 1

lution of the system reads ρ(2) = Λ20(ρ(0)) = Trenv(cid:104)Uη2Uη1(ρ(0)⊗ ωenv)U †

chose these two speciﬁc operators, however, similar results would be observed had we used two different non-commuting
operators. The parameters η1 and η2 are related to the strength of interaction and the time for one collision. We consider
η1 = η2 = η, and considering a weak interaction and a short collision time, η are assumed to be sufﬁciently small (η < 0.1) such
that eiησx,y ∼ (1 + iησx,y).

In the ﬁrst run of the experiment, the system interacts (collides) with qubit one of the environment and, in the second run,
the system repeats this collision and subsequently collides with qubit two of the environment. After each run, quantum state
tomography [32] is performed on the system in order to fully determine its state. Two orthogonal initial states of the system,
ρ1(0) = |0(cid:105)(cid:104)0| and ρ2(0) = |1(cid:105)(cid:104)1|, are prepared so that the distance D(ρ1( j),ρ2( j)) between them can be calculated after each
run j (orthogonality sets D(ρ1(0),ρ2(0)) = 1).
Being a qubit, the state of the the system can also be represented by a vector (cid:126)r = ((cid:104)σx(cid:105),(cid:104)σy(cid:105),(cid:104)σz(cid:105)) in the Bloch Sphere
((cid:104)σi(cid:105) = Tr{σiρ}) in which case the distance between ρ1 and ρ2 reduces to the geometric distance between the respec-
2|(cid:126)r1 −(cid:126)r2|. This quantity can be easily calculated for the initial states ρ1(0) = |0(cid:105)(cid:104)0| and ρ2(0) =

second collision, respectively. Expanding these results for η (cid:28) 1 we get ∆D = (1− 4q)η2 + O(η4), making it clear why, for
the range of η used in the experiment, ∆D must be positive, i.e. the dynamics must be non-Markovian, for any q < 1/4 (highly
anti-correlated environmental qubits). This result corresponds to the solid curves in Fig. 2.

sample diluted (1%) deuterated acetone (containing 97% of deuterium). The three nuclei spin-1/2 of the ﬂuorine atoms were
associated to system and environment qubits. The total system is described by the Hamiltonian

that a rotation of the angle θ on that particular spin was performed around the α direction and R ¯α(θ) = Rα(−θ). The boxes with the symbol τ1
represent a free evolution of the system and environment for a period of time τ1. After the ﬁrst collision, the resulting quantum state of system
and environment is represented by ρt (1). τ1 is the time needed such that a rotation of π/2 occurs in the system and here it will be given by
τ1 = 1/(4Js,env1) = 0.00358 s.

Preparation of the initial state and unitary operations

The NMR implementation of the collisions between the system and particles of the environment are shown in Figs. 4,5. The
boxes with the symbols Rα(θ) indicate that a rotation of the angle θ on that particular spin was performed around the α direction.
The big boxes are free evolution of the system for the time τ. The angles θ are related to the parameter η of the collisional model,
and they are of the order of 1°. For the steps used in the experiment the differences between them were approximately of 0.5°.
The system we have used is homonuclear, which means that all of the spins are of the same species (ﬂuorine in this case), and
implementing single rotations were hard because they are close in frequency. Then, the length of the pulses for exciting only one
spin (qubit) are long. This causes undesired evolutions of the quantum state due to the interactions between the spins, leading
the whole system to evolve while the individual operations are applied. Furthermore, the r f pulses are also imperfect and they
may affect others spins, besides the one which it is intended for. This means that at the end of the quantum algorithm lots of
errors due to these undesirable evolutions and pulse imperfections will have been accumulated. In order to correct the state of
the system the method described in [33] was used.

For the experiment, the values of η were very small and this created a huge source of errors in the operations, since they had
to be performed in tiny steps and, therefore, were not so different. In fact, the rotations angles were so small that the controlled
operations, which simulate the collisions, were very hard to be performed properly. In order to achieve the necessary precision
in the experiment the rotations of θ had to be precisely adjusted for each value of η of the speciﬁc collision. For adjusting the
angles values, two parameters may be varied, the amplitude and duration of the radio frequency pulses. However, varying these
two parameters the sequence of operations needed for the corrections changes as well. Therefore, the correct pulse sequences
were determined by combining the two analysis and testing in the spectrometer. A good precision could be achieved then and

the small rotations, of the order of 0.30 degrees, could be implemented. For the state preparation the pulse sequence shown in
Fig. 6 was performed, for more details see [34, 35]. The time τ2 of the free evolution here has a strict relation to the correlation
parameter q and is presented in Fig. 7. A the end of the circuit a magnetic ﬁeld gradient in the z-direction is applied, which
works as a transversal relaxation time killing the off-diagonal terms of the density matrix of system and environment. Finally,
after each run, full state tomography was performed in the state of the system [32].
Note that this experiment was done much faster (∼ 0.03 s) than the typical relaxation times of the elements of the C2F3I

molecule, which is of the order of 1 s.
