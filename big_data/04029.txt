A SIMPLE PROOF OF THE STRONG INTEGRALITY FOR FULL

COLORED HOMFLYPT INVARIANTS

SHENGMAO ZHU

Abstract. By using the HOMFLY skein theory. We prove a strong integrality theorem
for the reduced colored HOMFLYPT invariants deﬁned by a basis in the full HOMFLY
skein of the annulus.

1. Introduction

Let (L+, L−, L0) be the standard notation for the Conway triple of link diagrams. The
reduced Jones polynomial J(L; q) of a link (diagram) L can be determined by the following
skein relation

(1.1)

q2J(L+; q) − q−2J(L−; q) = (q − q−1)J(L0; q),

and the normalization condition J(U; q) = 1, where U denotes the trivial knot, i.e. the
unknot throughout this paper. By induction on the number of the components of the link
L. It is easy to obtain, for an orient link L with L components, J(L; q) ∈ Z[q±2]
for L
odd, and qJ(L; q) ∈ Z[q±2] if L even. In particular, for a knot K (i.e. a link with only
one component), we have J(K; q) ∈ Z[q±2]. The Jones polynomial J(L; q) can be viewed
as the Uq(sl2) quantum group invariant with the fundamental representations [18]. More
generally, for a simple complex Lie algebra g, T. Le [8] showed that, with a suitable
normalization, the quantum group Uq(g) invariants with any irreducible representations
lie in the ring Z[q±2] which is called the strong integrality (see Theorem 2.2 in [8]).

In this paper, we formulate a similar strong integrality theorem for the reduced colored
HOMFLYPT invariant deﬁned by a basis in the full HOMFLY skein of the annulus.
We use the results from the HOMFLY skein theory due to Morton, Aiston, Lukac etc
[1, 2, 16, 9] instead of using the quantum group theory by [11, 3]. So our proof is completely
diﬀerent from Le’s [8].

Let H(L; q, a) be the framed HOMFLYPT invariant of L determined by the local rela-
tions as showed in Figure 1. Let C be the full HOMFLY skein of the annulus, we will recall
the deﬁnition in Section 2. In [7], Hadji and H. R. Morton constructed the basis elements
Qλ,µ in the full skein C. For a link L with L components, we choose L basis elements
Qλα,µα, α = 1, ..., L in the skein C. We construct the satellite link L ⋆ ⊗L
α=1Qλα,µα. Then
the full colored HOMFLYPT invariant for a link L is given by

(1.2)

W[λ1,µ1],[λ2,µ2],..,[λL,µL](L; q, a)
= q− PL
α=1(κλα +κµα )w(Kα)a− PL

α=1(|λα|+|µα|)w(Kα)H(L ⋆ ⊗L

α=1Qλα,µα; q, a).

In particular, when all µα = ∅ for α = 1, .., L, W[λ1,∅],[λ2,∅],..,[λL,∅](L; q, a) is the ordinary
colored HOMFLYPT invariant Wλ1,λ2,..,λL(L; q, a) studied in [21, 4]. We refer to Section
2 and 3 for a review of the HOMFLY skein theory and the deﬁnition of the full colored

HOMFLYPT invariant for an oriented link. By the deﬁnition, W[λ1,µ1],[λ2,µ2],..,[λL,µL](L; q, a)
is not a polynomial of q±1, a±1 in general, because of the factors (qk − q−k) in the denom-
inator.
In order to kill these factors, we introduce the notion of reduced full colored
HOMFLYPT invariants.

For the case of a knot K, it is natural to deﬁne the reduced full colored HOMFLYPT

invariant of K by

(1.3)

Then, we have

P[λ,µ](K; q, a) =

W[λ,µ](K; q, a)
W[λ,µ](U; q, a)

.

Theorem 1.1. For any knot K, P[λ,µ](K; q, a) ∈ Z[q±2, a±2].

In fact, Theorem 1.1 is a special case of the following Theorem 1.2. Theorem 1.1 can
also be proved directly by using the integrality theorem [16](i.e Theorem 1 in [16]) and
the Theorem 1.3 in the following for the case of knot.

It seems natural to generalize the deﬁnition of the reduced full colored HOMFLYPT

invariants for a general link L with L components as follow:

(1.4)

P[λ1,µ1],..,[λL,µL](L; q, a) =

W[λ1,µ1],..,[λL,µL](L; q, a)
α=1 W[λα,µα](U; q, a)

.

QL

Unfortunately, P[λ1,µ1],..,[λL,µL](L; q, a) does not lie in the ring Z[q±1, a±1] in general. The
recent works by S. Nawata et al. [17, 5] motivate us to deﬁne the following [λα, µα]-reduced
HOMFLYPT invariants for a link L:

(1.5)

Q[λα,µα]

[λ1,µ1],...,[λL,µL](L; q, a) =

W[λ1,µ1],...,[λL,µL](L; q, a)

W[λα,µα](U; q, a)

for α = 1, ..., L.

However, Q[λα,µα]
nominator. In order to kill these factors, we add a factor to Q[λα,µα]
introduce the notation of the normalized [λα, µα]-reduced invariant as

[λ1,µ1],...,[λL,µL](L; q, a) still contains the factors of the forms (qk − q−k) in de-
[λ1,µ1],...,[λL,µL](L; q, a), and

(1.6)

P [λα,µα]
[λ1,µ1],...,[λL,µL](L; q, a) =

Yρβ ,νβ

(a · qcn(x))(qhl(x) − q−hl(x))

· Q[λα,µα]

[λ1,µ1],...,[λL,µL](L; q, a).

See Section 3.1 for the deﬁnitions of cn(x), hl(x) in formula (1.6).

The main goal of this paper is to prove the following:

Theorem 1.2. For any α = 1, ..., L, we have

(1.7)

P [λα,µα]
[λ1,µ1],...,[λL,µL](L; q, a) ∈ Z[q±2, a±2].

We give some special cases of Theorem 1.2. For example, when all the partitions µβ = ∅,

we let

(1.8)

λ1,...,λL(L; q, a) : = P [λα,∅]
P λα

[λ1,∅],...,[λL,∅](L; q, a)

(a · qcn(x))(qhl(x) − q−hl(x))

Wλ1,...,λL(L; q, a)

Wλα(U; q, a)

.

Moreover, if we take λ1 = λ2 = · · · = λL = (rρ), by some straight calculations, we have

(qhl(x) − q−hl(x)) =

{r + i}!

Hence,

Theorem 1.2 implies P (rρ)
(rρ),...,(rρ)(L; q, a) ∈ Z[q±2, a±2]. This is just a statement in [5](see
the last paragraph in page 42 in [5]. In fact, the deﬁnition of P ﬁn
(rρ)(L; a, q) given by for-
mula (3.2) in [5] is equal to (−1)rρ(L−1)P (rρ)
(rρ),...,(rρ)(L; q, a) ). According to the work [5],
P (rρ)
(rρ),...,(rρ)(L; q, a) ∈ Z[q±2, a±2] suggests that P (rρ)
(rρ),...,(rρ)(L; q, a) may have a categoriﬁca-
tion whose homology is ﬁnite dimensional. Similarly, Theorem 1.2 provides us a fact that
the categoriﬁcation of the general invariant P [λα,µα]
[λ1,µ1],...,[λL,µL](L; q, a) has a ﬁnite dimensional
homology.

In order to prove Theorem 1.2, ﬁrstly, we give a simple proof of the following symmetries

for the full colored HOMFLYPT invariants.

Theorem 1.3. For any link L with L-components, we have

(1.11)

(1.12)

(1.13)

W[λ1,µ1],..,[λL,µL](L; q−1, a) = (−1)PL
W[λ1,µ1],..,[λL,µL](L; −q, a) = (−1)PL
W[λ1,µ1],..,[λL,µL](L; q, −a) = (−1)PL

α=1(|λα|+|µα|)W[(λ1)t,(µ1)t],..,[(λL)t,(µL)t](L; q, a),
α=1(|λα|+|µα|)W[λ1,µ1],..,[λL,µL](L; q, a),
α=1(|λα|+|µα|)W[λ1,µ1],..,[λL,µL](L; q, a).

Remark 1.4. When all the µα = ∅, it is well-known that the above symmetries hold for
the ordinary colored HOMFLYPT invariants Wλ1,..,λL(L; q, a) of a link L:

(1.14)

(1.15)

(1.16)

W~λ(L; q−1, t) = (−1)k~λkW~λt(L; q, t),
W~λ(L; −q−1, t) = W~λt(L; q, t),

W~λ(L; q, −t) = (−1)k~λkW~λ(L; q, t).

The ﬁrst proof of these symmetries was given in the paper [12, 13], a diﬀerent proof for
(1.14) and (1.15) was given in [21]. Then, in the joint paper with Q. Chen, K. Liu and P.
Peng [4], we provide a new simple proof for (1.14),(1.15),(1.16). Recent, D. Tubbenhauer,
P. Vaz and P. Wedrich [20] also give a diﬀerent proof for (1.14). In this paper, we follow
the method used in [4] to prove Theorem 1.3 in Section 4.

Then, by using the integrality theorem in [16] (i.e. Theorem 1.1 in [16]) with a slight

modiﬁcation, we ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 1.2 in Section 5.

2. The Skein models

Given a planar surface F , the framed HOMFLY skein S(F ) of F is the Λ-linear com-
bination of orientated tangles in F , modulo the two local relations as showed in ﬁgure 1,
where z = q − q−1, the coeﬃcient ring Λ = Z[q±1, a±1] with the elements qk − q−k admit-

Figure 2. Removal of a null-homotopic closed curve

the above relations. It follows that the removal of a null-homotopic closed curve without
crossings is equivalent to time a scalar s = a−a−1
q−q−1 .

2.1. The plane. When F = R2, it is easy to follow that every element in S(F ) can
be represented as a scalar in Λ. For a link L with a diagram DL, the resulting scalar
hDLi ∈ Λ is the framed HOMFLYPT polynomial of the link L. In the following, we will
also use the notation H(L; q, a) to denote the hDLi for simplicity. In particular, as to the
unknot U, we have H(U; q, a) = a−a−1
q−q−1 .

2.2. The annulus. Let C be the HOMFLY skein of the annulus, i.e. C = S(S1 ⊗ I).
C is a commutative algebra with the product induced by placing one annulus outside
another. C is freely generated by the set {Am : m ∈ Z}, Am for m 6= 0 is the closure
of the braid σ|m|−1 · · · σ2σ1, and A0 is the empty diagram [19]. It follows that C contains
two subalgebras C+ and C− which are generated by {Am : m ∈ Z, m ≥ 0} and {Am : m ∈
Z, m ≤ 0}. The algebra C+ is spanned by the subspace Cn,0. There is a good basis {Qλ}
of C+ consisting of the closures of certain idempotents of Hecke algebra Hn,0 [9].

In [7], R. Hadji and H. Morton constructed the basis elements {Qλ,µ} explicitly for C.

We will review this construction in next section.

3.1. Partitions and symmetric functions. A partition λ is a ﬁnite sequence of positive
integers (λ1, λ2, ..) such that λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · The length of λ is the total number of parts
i=1 λi. If |λ| = d, we say
λ is a partition of d and denoted as λ ⊢ d. The automorphism group of λ, denoted by
Aut(λ), contains all the permutations that permute parts of λ by keeping it as a partition.
i=1 mi(λ)! where mi(λ) denotes the number
of times that i occurs in λ. We can also write a partition λ as λ = (1m1(λ)2m2(λ) · · · ). We
denote by P the set of all the partitions.

in λ and denoted by l(λ). The degree of λ is deﬁned by |λ| =Pl(λ)
Obviously, Aut(λ) has the order |Aut(λ)| =Ql(λ)

Every partition can be identiﬁed as a Young diagram. The Young diagram of λ is a
graph with λi boxes on the i-th row for j = 1, 2, .., l(λ), where we have enumerate the
rows from top to bottom and the columns from left to right. The j-th box in the i-th row
has the coordinates (i, j). The content cn(x) of the box x = (i, j) is deﬁned to be j − i.
Given a partition λ, we deﬁne the conjugate partition λt whose Young diagram is
the transposed Young diagram of λ which is derived from the Young diagram of λ by
reﬂection in the main diagonal. For the box x = (i, j) ∈ λ, the hook length is deﬁned to
be hl(x) = λi + λt

j − i − j + 1.

The following numbers associated with a given partition λ are used frequently in this
j=1 λj(λj − 2j + 1). Obviously, κλ is an even

number and κλ = −κλt.

The power sum symmetric function of inﬁnite variables x = (x1, .., xN , ..) is deﬁned by

where χλ is the character of the irreducible representation of the symmetric group S|µ|

3.2. Basic elements in C. Given a permutation π ∈ Sm with the length l(π), let ωπ
be the positive permutation braid associated to π. We have l(π) = w(ωπ), the writhe
number of the braid ωπ.

We deﬁne the quasi-idempotent element in Hecke alegbra Hm,

C is spanned by the monomials in {hm, h∗

matrix Mλ,µ with entries in {hm, h∗

and h∗

k = 0 if k < 0.

It is easy to note that the subscripts of the diagonal entries in the h-rows are the parts

the parts µ1, µ2, .., µr of µ in reverse order.

Then, Qλ,µ is deﬁned as the determinant of the matrix Mλ,µ, i.e.

3.3. Full colored HOMFLYPT invariants. Let L be a framed link with L components
with a ﬁxed numbering. For diagrams Q1, .., QL in the skein model of annulus with the
positive oriented core C, we deﬁne the decoration of L with Q1, .., QL as the link

L ⋆ ⊗L

which derived from L by replacing every annulus L by the annulus with the diagram Qα
such that the orientations of the cores match. Each Qα has a small backboard neighbor-
hood in the annulus which makes the decorated link L ⊗L

α=1 Qα into a framed link.

In particular, when Qλα,µα ∈ Cdα,tα, where λα, µα are the partitions of positive integers

dα and tα respectively, for α = 1, .., L.

Deﬁnition 3.1. The full colored HOMFLYPT invariant of L is deﬁned as follow:

W[λ1,µ1],[λ2,µ2],..,[λL,µL](L; q, a)

W[λ1,µ1],[λ2,µ2],..,[λL,µL](L; q, a) is a framing independent invariant of link L. In fact, by the
result in [6], the framing factor for Qλ,µ is qκλ+κµt|λ|+|µ|.

Before giving the proof of Theorem 1.3, we need an observation which is an easy con-
sequence of the formula (3.7). We introduce the notation {m} = qm − q−m, and for a

Lemma 4.1. Given any two partitions λ and µ, for a knot K, we have

(4.1)

{λ}{µ}H(K ⋆ PλP ∗

µ; q, a) ∈ Z[(q − q−1)2, a±1].

Proof. By using the skein relations in Figure 1 for framed HOMFLYPT invariant H(L; q, a),
we have, for a link L with L components,

(4.2)

(q − q−1)LH(L; q, a) ∈ Z[(q − q−1)2, a±1].

H(K ⋆ Am−1−j,j; q, a) ∈ Z[(q − q−1)2, a±1],

forward to obtain the formula (4.1) in the same way.
(cid:3)

By using the above integrality result, we prove the following symmetries for the full

α=1(|λα|+|µα|)W[λ1,µ1],..,[λL,µL](L; q, a).

Proof. For convenience, we only provide the proof for the case of a knot K. The method
can be easily generalized to the case for a general link. By Lemma 4.1, for any two
partitions τ and δ, we have,

(4.8)

{τ }{δ}H(K ⋆ Pτ P ∗

δ ; q, a) ∈ Z[(q − q−1)2, a±1].

Combing with the identity ({τ }{δ})q→−q = (−1)|τ |+|δ|{τ }{δ}, we obtain

H(K ⋆ Pτ P ∗

δ ; −q, a) = (−1)|τ |+|δ|H(K ⋆ Pτ P ∗

W[λ,µ](K, −q, a) = (−1)|λ|+|µ|W[λ,µ](K, q, a),

since κλ is even for any partition λ.

Similarly, by formula (4.8), we have

(4.14)

H(K ⋆ Pτ P ∗

δ ; q−1, a) = (−1)l(τ )+l(δ)H(K ⋆ Pτ P ∗

δ ; q, a).

By using the identities,

(4.15)

we have

(4.16)

χρt(τ ) = (−1)|ρ|−l(τ )χρ(τ ), χνt(δ) = (−1)|ν|−l(δ)χρ(δ),

H(K ⋆ QρQ∗

ν; q−1, a) = (−1)|ρ|+|ν|H(K ⋆ QρtQ∗

νt; q, a).

By the formula (3.5) for cλ

σ,ρ, it is easy to get

(4.17)

Therefore,

(4.18)

i.e.

(4.19)

σ,ρ = cλt
cλ

σt,ρt, cµ

σt,ν = cµt

σ,νt.

H(K ⋆ Qλ,µ; q−1, a) = (−1)|λ|+|µ|H(K ⋆ Qλ,µ; q, a).

W[λ,µ](K, q−1, a) = (−1)|λ|+|µ|W[λt,µt](K, q, a),

since κλ = −κλt and κµ = −κµt.

Finally, in order to show the last identity (4.7), by using the Lemma 4.3 proved in [4],

we have (see the formula (4.22) in [4]):

(4.20)

H(K ⋆ Pτ P ∗

δ ; q, −a) = (−1)(|τ |+|δ|)(w(K)−1)H(K ⋆ Pτ P ∗

δ ; q, a).

Then it is direct to show

(4.21)

i.e.

(4.22)

H(K ⋆ Q[λ,µ]; q, −a) = (−1)(|λ|+|µ|)(w(K)−1)H(K ⋆ Q[λ,µ]; q, a),

W[λ,µ](K, q, −a) = (−1)|λ|+|µ|W[λ,µ](K, q, a).

5. Proof of the strong integrality

Let us ﬁrst consider the case of a knot K. Recall the deﬁnition of the reduced full

colored HOMFLYPT invariant

(5.1)

P[λ,µ](K; q, a) =

W[λ,µ](K; q, a)
W[λ,µ](U; q, a)

.

The main result in [16] (see Theorem 1 in [16]) can be written in the following form:

Proposition 5.1 (Morton). For any knot K, P[λ,µ](K; q, a) is a 2-variable integer Laurent
polynomial, i.e. P[λ,µ](K; q, a) ∈ Z[q±1, a±1].

By the formulas (4.6) and (4.7) in Theorem 4.2, we immediately obtain:

(5.2)

P[λ,µ](K; −q, a) = P[λ,µ](K; q, a), P[λ,µ](K; q, −a) = P[λ,µ](K; q, a).

Therefore, P[λ,µ](K; q, a) satisﬁes the following strong integrality:

Theorem 5.2. For any knot K, P[λ,µ](K; q, a) ∈ Z[q±2, a±2].

In fact, Proposition 5.1 can be generalized slightly to the case of any link as follow. For
a link L with L components K1, ..., KL, if we only decorate the α-th component Kα with
Qλα,µα, then its full colored HOMFLYPY invariant is denoted by W[λα,µα](L; q, a). Let

(5.3)

we also have

P[λα,µα](L; q, a) =

W[λα,µα](L; q, a)
W[λα,µα](U; q, a)

,

Proposition 5.3. P[λα,µα](L; q, a) ∈ Z[q±1, a±1].

Proof. A slight modiﬁcation for the proof of Proposition 5.1 presented in [16]( see page
333-334) will give the proof of Proposition 5.3. In fact, given a link L with L components

get a 1-tangle, so we can draw L in the annulus as the closure of this 1-tangle. Decorating

K1, ..., KL, we denote it by L = K1W K2W · · ·W KL. We cut the component Kα open and
Kα with a diagram Qα gives a diagram K1W · · ·W Kα ⋆ QαW · · ·W KL in C, it induces a
Kα. Then K1W · · ·W Kα ⋆ QαW · · ·W KL =

linear map T L
If Qα is an eigenvector of T L
Kα(Qα) = aL
T L

Kα : C → C. Refer to the page 332 in [16] for this construction in the case of K.

Kα with eigenvalue aL

KαU ⋆ Qα implies that

KαQα = aL

Kα corresponding to eigenvector by aL

Kα commutes with the meridian
Kα(λ, µ),

(5.4)

aL
Kα =

H(K1W · · ·W Kα ⋆ QαW · · ·W KL; q, a)

H(U ⋆ Qα; q, a)

.

Kα are given by Qλ,µ since the map T L

The eigenvectors of T L
map φ, see [7]. We denote the eigenvalue of T L
the proof of Theorem 1 in [16](see page 334) shows that
Kα(λ, µ) ∈ Z[q±1, a±1].
aL

(5.5)

Moreover, Proposition 5.3 immediately implies that

Proposition 5.4. For any link L, the full colored HOMFLYPT invariants W[λ1,µ1],...,[λL,µL](L; q, a)
contains a factor W[λα,µα](U; q, a) where α can be chosen to be 1, ..., L.

STRONG INTEGRALITY FOR FULL COLORED HOMFLYPT INVARIANTS

This phenomenon has been showed in [17] after doing many detailed calculations for
colored HOMFLYPT invariants with symmetric representations by Chern-Simons theory.
Now, we recall the deﬁnition of normalized [λα, µα]-reduced full colored HOMFLYPT

invariant in Section 1.

for α = 1, ..., L.

We have the following strong integrality:

Theorem 5.5. For α = 1, ..., L, we have

(5.8)

P [λα,µα]
[λ1,µ1],...,[λL,µL](L; q, a) ∈ Z[q±2, a±2].

H(U ⋆ Qλ; q, a) =Xµ

Therefore, we have

H(U ⋆ Qλ; q, a) =Yx∈λ

P [λα,µα]

On the other hand, by formulas (4.6) and (4.7), we have

(5.21)

Q[λα,µα]
[λ1,µ1],...,[λL,µL](L; ±q, ∓a) = (−1)Pβ6=α(|λβ |+|µβ|)Q[λα,µα]

[λ1,µ1],...,[λL,µL](L; q, a).

Combing the two expressions (5.14) and (5.15) for colored HOMFLYPT invariant of the
unknot U, for any partition λ, we obtain the identity:

(5.22)

(−1)|λ| = (−1)Px∈λ(hl(x)+cn(x)).

STRONG INTEGRALITY FOR FULL COLORED HOMFLYPT INVARIANTS

Thus

P [λα,µα]
[λ1,µ1],...,[λL,µL](L; ±q, ∓a) = P [λα,µα]

[λ1,µ1],...,[λL,µL](L; q, a).

Combing formulas (5.20) and (5.23), we obtain

(5.24)

P [λα,µα]
[λ1,µ1],...,[λL,µL](L; q, a) ∈ Z[q±2, a±2].
