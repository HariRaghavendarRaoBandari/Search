Abstract

Preliminary ATLAS and CMS results from the ﬁrst 13 TeV LHC run have encountered an intrigu-

ing excess of events in the diphoton channel around the invariant mass of 750 GeV. We investigate

a possibility that the current excess is due to a heavy resonance decaying to light metastable states,
which in turn give displaced decays to very highly collimated e+e− pairs. Such decays may pass

the photon selection criteria, and successfully mimic the diphoton events, especially at low counts.

We investigate two classes of such models, characterized by the following underlying production
and decay chains: gg → S → A(cid:48)A(cid:48) → (e+e−)(e+e−) and q ¯q → Z(cid:48) → sa → (e+e−)(e+e−), where
at the ﬁrst step a heavy scalar, S, or vector, Z(cid:48), resonances are produced that decay to light
metastable vectors, A(cid:48), or (pseudo-)scalars, s and a. Setting the parameters of the models to ex-

plain the existing excess, and taking the ATLAS detector geometry into account, we marginalize

over the properties of heavy resonances in order to derive the expected lifetimes and couplings of
metastable light resonances. We observe that in the case of A(cid:48), the suggested range of masses and

mixing angles  is within reach of several new-generation intensity frontier experiments.

INTRODUCTION

The start of the LHC run at 13 TeV center-of-mass energy has brought an unexpected

– from the minimalist point of view – excess of events in the diphoton channel with the

invariant mass of about 750 GeV [1, 2]. In the Standard Model (SM) of particles and ﬁelds

this energy is not associated with any known resonance, and may be the ﬁrst sign for elusive

New Physics (NP). The appearance of the “bump” in the diphoton spectrum, despite its

rather limited statistical signiﬁcance that may disappear or strengthen with more data, has

generated a lot of excitement among physicists who wait for any manifestation of NP beyond

SM (BSM) at the weak scale.

It is true that in most models of NP, the diphoton channel would not necessarily be

the “discovery mode”. That is, other manifestations of a (tenuous) 750 GeV resonance

might have been expected ﬁrst. Nevertheless, large classes of models where said resonance

is produced from the fusion of the SM gauge bosons and/or quark-antiquark pairs with

subsequent decay to the diphoton states have appeared in the literature, most of them

being tailored for the occasion. While the mass of a new resonance suggested by the CMS

and (mostly) ATLAS data is to be around 750 GeV, its spin and parity remain open for

discussion. Spin zero and two resonances come as the most natural candidates, while spin

one resonance is disfavored by the so-called “Landau-Yang theorem” that forbids the two

photons in any state with the total angular momentum equal to one [3, 4]. The couplings

of the spin-zero resonances to photons or gluons cannot be expected to arise at dimension

four or lower operator level, and therefore it is reasonable to expect that 750 GeV resonance

is also coupled to the weak-scale particles, charged under the SM gauge groups. The loops

of these particles (for example, vector-like fermions [5–14]) may have led to the eﬀective

couplings of the NP resonance to gauge bosons [15–37]. If this picture is indeed valid, then

more signatures of weak-scale NP are likely to come from the future data.

While noting still a rather limited signiﬁcance of the excess, it is reasonable to question

every element of the existing anomaly. In particular, it is important to ask whether light

BSM ﬁnal states may be confused with the diphoton signal. A general framework for such

scenario has been already discussed in several publications [38–41]. A heavy resonance X

produced by the gluon-gluon or quark-antiquark fusion may decay to a pair of light BSM

states Y that have weak instability against subsequent decays to electron-positron pairs or

2

photon pairs. We will call the Y states as “dark mediators” (see e.g. Refs. [42–47]). If the

decay length of Y is commensurate with the linear geometry of the detector (e.g., of the

inner tracker and eletro-magnetic calorimeter) and its mass is in the MeV-GeV range, then

emergent highly collimated pairs of photons and/or electron-positron pairs may successfully

mimic actual photons. Therefore, the zest of this scenario is that a new 750 GeV resonance

opens the door to the light weakly coupled states coupled to the SM sector, which is a

particular realization of the “hidden valley” idea [48–59].

In recent years, dedicated searches of light weakly coupled states coupled to electrons,

photons, muons and other light particles have become an important BSM direction at the

intensity frontier [48, 60–93]. They have resulted in signiﬁcantly strengthened constraints

on the mass–coupling parameter states of light NP particles. The purpose of this paper is to

explore the consequences of the scenario where a 750 GeV resonance decays to dark mediators

in terms of its implications for the intensity frontier searches. To that eﬀect, we construct two

explicit models, with heavy spin-zero and spin-one resonances, that decay to dark mediators.

The parameters of the models are chosen to ﬁt the current ATLAS excess of the diphoton

events under the assumption that decaying mediators do indeed pass the selection criteria

for the photon identiﬁcation. In the process, we make careful accounting for the ATLAS

geometry and the distribution of dark mediators over the eﬀective decay length. The end

result is a suggested range for masses and couplings of dark mediators that falls largely within

reach of the next generation of intensity frontier experiments (e.g. [67, 68, 77, 84, 94–97]).

The paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst introduce the theoretical framework for the
dark mediator explanation of the 750 GeV candidate resonance in §II. We then calculate
the strength of expected signal, evaluate the probability of light particles decays inside the

relevant parts of ATLAS detector, and present favored parameter spaces for various models
in §III. Diﬀerent experimental strategies that would allow diﬀerentiating diphoton from
di-dark mediator events are discussed in §IV. We conclude in §V.

II. THEORETICAL MOTIVATION

A.

750 GeV Scalar Resonance

In this sub-section, we consider a model of a heavy dark scalar (or pseudo-scalar) reso-

nance S produced via gluon fusion that decays to the pair of two metastable “dark photon”
particles A(cid:48). Each A(cid:48) gives displaced decays to e+e− pairs so that the whole chain can be
represented as

gg → S → A(cid:48)A(cid:48) → (e+e−)(e+e−).

(1)
Here we explore a possibility that mS (cid:39) 750 GeV, but A(cid:48) is light, mA(cid:48) < O(few GeV).
Because each dark photon carries a signiﬁcant fraction of energy of the 750-GeV scalar, the
e+e− pair from the decay of A(cid:48) are extremely collimated. The opening angle of e+e− pair
is around 2mA(cid:48)/EA(cid:48), where mA(cid:48) and EA(cid:48) are the mass and energy of A(cid:48), respectively. For
sub-GeV A(cid:48)s this angle is less than 0.01. Therefore it is plausible that events originating
from the decay of A(cid:48) could pass the selection criteria for a real photon set by e.g. The
ATLAS collaboration.

Dark photon models have been studied extensively in the literature since the 1980’s

[98, 99].

In recent years, the attention to dark photons have been spearheaded by their

possible connection to various particle physics and astrophysics “anomalies” (see e.g. [44,

45, 71, 100]). The minimal dark photon model consists of a new massive vector ﬁeld that

couples to the SM U (1) via the so-called kinetic mixing operator,

µν = ∂[µA(cid:48)

where F (cid:48)
ν] and Bµν = ∂[µBν] are ﬁeld strengths of the U (1)D, U (1)Y gauge group
respectively. The mass term breaks the U (1)D explicitly but does not ruin the renormal-

izability. Y is the kinetic mixing parameter, which we will explicitly assume to be much
smaller than one. It dictates the magnitude of the coupling of A(cid:48) to the SM sector. Even if
the boundary conditions in the deep UV are such that Y (ΛU V ) = 0, the non-zero mixing can

be mediated by a loop process with heavy particles charged under both U (1) groups [98]. In
such a scenario, the choice Y (cid:28) 1 is justiﬁed due to the expected loop suppression. After
electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB), the SM gauge ﬁeld Bµ, and W 3
µ mix with the new
µ. The resulting mass eigenstate Z(cid:48) couples to the SM electromagnetic and
gauge ﬁeld A(cid:48)

weak neutral currents. In the limit

mZ(cid:48) (cid:28) mZ,

Y (cid:28) 1,

the mixing between A(cid:48) and the SM Z-boson is negligible, while the coupling between Z(cid:48) and
SM fermions are given by

Y cos θW eQ ≡ eQ,

(3)
where we introduce  ≡ Y cos θW . For more detailed discussions on the kinetic mixing, see
Appendix A. Finally, to avoid the proliferation of notations, we will call the physical Z(cid:48)
particle as A(cid:48), and refer to it as the dark photon.

Our goal is to derive the acceptable range for masses and couplings in the proposed

scenario. To achieve this, we need to specify the couplings of scalar S to gluons and dark

photons beyond the eﬀective dim = 5 operators. To that eﬀect, we introduce a vector-like

colored fermion, T , and a dark fermion, ψ, which is a singlet under the SM gauge group.

The resulting Lagrangian reads

where Qf and Qd are U (1)EM and U (1)D charges, respectively. e, gs and gd are U (1)EM,

SU (3)c, and U (1)D gauge couplings, respectively. λT and λd are the Yukawa couplings of S

to T and ψ fermions, respectively. Notice that one does not have to choose positive parity,
and S ¯T iγ5T pseudo-scalar couplings could also serve the same purpose. T and ψ fermion
loops mediate the production and decay of S resonance, as shown in Fig. 1.

Having formulated the model, we are now ready to evaluate the strength of the fake

diphoton signal in it. We start from the master formula for the signal,

σSignal = σpp→S × BrS→A(cid:48)A(cid:48) × P(cid:0) A(cid:48)A(cid:48) → (e+e−)(e+e−)(cid:12)(cid:12) γγ(cid:1) ,

where σpp→S

is

the

cross

section for producing 750 GeV resonance S and

BrS→A(cid:48)A(cid:48)
is the branching ratio of this resonance decaying to two dark photons.
P (A(cid:48)A(cid:48) → (e+e−)(e+e−)| γγ) is the probability that two dark photons decay to electron-
positron pairs inside the detector (within appreciable distance), passing the selection criteria

for the diphoton events, and successful reconstruction. It is the most complicated object. It

depends on factors such as the detector geometry, the detector acceptance, the reconstruction
eﬃciency, as well as the decay length of A(cid:48), and the mass of A(cid:48) that aﬀects the size and the
shape of the shower in the EM calorimeter. We will abbreviate P (A(cid:48)A(cid:48) → (e+e−)(e+e−)| γγ)
as Pacc. The existing excess in the diphoton channel found by ATLAS [1] is at the level of
σSignal (cid:39) 5 − 10 fb, which corresponds to ∼ 16 to 32 events.

Production and decay of S in a U (1)D model

Data suggest that the total width of S is around 5 − 45 GeV, and therefore the narrow
width approximation for S suﬃces for our accuracy. The production cross section of S

through gluon fusion is given by

mediated by the loop of heavy vector-like fermions T . The actual constraints on mT would

critically depend on T -fermion decay channels. To reduce the number of parameters to be

scanned, we will adopt mT = 1 TeV throughout, which is safe relative to direct searches.
Note that for such a massive particle in the loops, the form factor of the eﬀective g − g − S
vertex does not need to be taken into account. A very well known formula for the calculation

of the width (e.g., see [101]) gives

The cross section (7) can be further improved by taking into account NLO corrections. With
these expressions, we ﬁnd that a ﬁducial value for the σpp→S cross section at mT ∼ 1 TeV
and λT ∼ 1 to be around 40 fb.

The branching ratio of S to dark photons directly follows from the three decay channels

of the heavy scalar: S → gg, S → ¯ψψ, and S → A(cid:48)A(cid:48),

negligibly small compared to mS and mψ.

The total width and branching ratios of the S-resonance are illustrated in Fig. 2. We

have taken λT to what we will consider its uppermost value, 4π, (which would imply a
strongly interacting S − T sector). We can observe that if the decays to dark fermions ψ
are allowed, one could easily achieve a width of the S resonance of ∼ 40 GeV. Rather large
branching ratios to pairs of dark photons can be achieved for αd ∼ O(1). We note in passing
that the hierarchy of mass scales, mψ (cid:29) mA(cid:48) and large coupling constant λd will create a
variety of interesting eﬀects for the dark matter phenomenology, should ψ remain stable on

cosmological time scales (see e.g. [45, 102]).

We now come to the most technically challenging part, the evaluation of A(cid:48) decays mim-
icking the diphoton signal, Pacc. In a hypothetical limit of an inﬁnite detector with 100%

eﬃciency and 100% faking rate for a dark photon as a regular photon, this probability is

At higher mA(cid:48) one has to include muon and hadronic decay channels, i.e., ΓA(cid:48) = ΓA(cid:48)→e+e− +
ΓA(cid:48)→µ+µ− + ΓA(cid:48)→hadronic.

In practice, of course, there are strict geometric requirements where the decays of the

dark photons must occur so that they can be confused with a real photon. Obviously, a very

important requirement is that both dark photons decay before or inside the ﬁrst layer of the

EM calorimeter, which depends rather sensitively on the decay length. Suppose that the

parent S particle is produced almost at rest, and then decays into two dark photons, each

of them carries energy around mS/2, where mS is the mass of the heavy scalar S. Then the

and βA(cid:48) is almost one. The decay length follows an approximate scaling

These numbers immediately tell us that currently allowed region of the dark photon

parameter space can indeed be compatible with dark photons decaying within reasonable

distance inside the LHC detectors so that they can be confused with real photons. If initial

boost distributions of S particles, and angular dependences of its production and of detector

geometry could have been neglected, then Pacc would be determined by the relation between

some relevant length scale of the detector, Ldet, and LA(cid:48).

Pl<Ldet ∝ 1 − exp{−Ldet/LA(cid:48)} =⇒ Pacc ∝ (BrA(cid:48)→e+e−)2 × (Pl<Ldet)2,

(17)

where Pl<Ldet is the probability of a single photon to decay inside Ldet. This is of course a
very crude formula that has to be carefully augmented for the detector geometry, boosts,
and other factors, which we will attempt to do in section §III. We also note that should one
of the dark photons decay outside the detector, this would mimic the mono-photon signal

with the probability that scales as

Pmono ∝ 2 × BrA(cid:48)→e+e− × Pl<Ldet × Pl>Ldet,

(18)

setting up the stage for an important constraint that would come from corresponding

searches.

Variations on the dark photon model

In this subsection we would like to note that the dark photon model is not the only

possibility for a weakly unstable light vector particles. Indeed, there are other UV complete
choices based on anomaly-free symmetries, such as B − L, LL1 − LL2 (where L1 and L2
stand for diﬀerent lepton ﬂavors) etc. If we take, for example, a model with U (1)-gauged
Le − Lτ symmetry, then the main couplings of its gauge boson V to leptons are

L = gLe−Lτ Vα

¯νeγανe − ¯ντ γαντ + ¯eγαe − ¯τ γατ

.

(19)

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

Here, gLe−Lτ is the U (1)Le−Lτ gauge coupling, so that the coupling to electrons is rescaled
compared to the dark photon case as e → gLe−Lτ . In the entire mass range from a few MeV
to 3.6 GeV the vector boson V decays to electrons and neutrinos, with equal probabilities

so that BrV →e+e− = 0.5.

Despite the fact that one can choose gLe−Lτ in the same range as e and thus adjust

the decay length of V to be commensurate with Ldet, this model does not look as a good
candidate to mimic the diphoton signal, for the following reasons. Firstly, gLe−Lτ is required
to be very small, gLe−Lτ < 10−2, from the decay length requirements, which would correspond
to a tiny αd. This in turn would require some additional model-building to generate an

appreciable branching of S to V V states. Another reason is that this model will give a

non-removable mono-photon signal due to the decay to neutrinos at a rate more than twice

the diphoton signal, for any ratio of Ldet/LV . On account of these two diﬃculties, we will
abandon further investigation of U (1)Le−Lτ models in connection to the 750 GeV resonance.

B.

750 GeV Vector Resonance

If light unstable particles can indeed fake real photons at the LHC, new possibilities for

the spin of the 750 GeV resonance open up. In this section we will consider an option of

dark mediators being scalar and pseudo-scalar, while the decayed 750 GeV resonance being

a spin-1 vector boson. Notice that this is a novel possibility bypassing the Landau-Yang

theorem (see e.g. earlier related discussion in Ref. [103, 104]).

The scenario of this section is based on the following sequence,

q ¯q → Z(cid:48) → sa → (e+e−)(e+e−),

(20)

10

where all new particles Z(cid:48), s, a are assumed to be singlets under the SM gauge group. Scalar
s and pseudo-scalar a can be combined in a complex scalar ﬁeld

S = s + ia,

(21)

that we assume is charged under some new U (1)D group with dark charge Qd = 1. The mass
of a heavy dark Z(cid:48) boson is taken around 750 GeV. The coupling of Z(cid:48) to the SM can again
proceed via the kinetic mixing operator. To avoid confusion with the case of the previous
section, we will call the heavy boson Z(cid:48) (while the light one is A(cid:48)). The Feynman diagrams
for the process is shown as Fig. 3.

FIG. 3: Feynman diagram for q ¯q → Z(cid:48) → sa, where Z(cid:48) is the 750 GeV vector resonance and s(a)

is the light on-shell scalar (pseudo-scalar) that faking photons.

The kinetic mixing operator will couple the Z(cid:48) to hypercharge of the SM particles (as
opposed the electric charge in case of small vector mass). Since for the chosen mZ(cid:48) mass

scale

cate” part of the Lagrangian that is responsible for the decays of a and s particles. Notice

that one cannot simply write down λss¯ee and λaa¯eiγ5e operators at the fundamental level, as

they would explicitly violate both the SM and U (1)D gauge invariances. Nevertheless these

−1. For the purpose of our discussion, H and Φ can be replaced by their vacuum expectation

values, v/

now deﬁnes the eﬀective Yukawa couplings as

(26)
Since it is clear that displaced decays are only possible for λS (cid:28) 1 and typically as small as
10−4 while heavy mZ(cid:48) implies a large dark vev vd, the scale ΛΦ can be well above the LHC
energy reach. We leave it at that, without trying to provide further UV completion to the

.

eﬀective operator (25). A further uncertainty in this approach arises from a possibility of

nontrivial lepton ﬂavor structure of (25). To avoid possible complications, we will assume

that these couplings are ﬂavor-diagonal, and will limit ms,a to be below the dimuon threshold.

Production and decay of Z(cid:48)

Going over to the production mechanism, we notice, of course, that Z(cid:48) does not couple
to gluons, and have to be produced in q ¯q fusion. Although the probability of ﬁnding (anti-

)quarks inside the proton at high energy is smaller compared to that of gluons, the leading

order contribution of this process is at tree-level and thus the cross section can be comparable
to gluon-initiated but loop-suppressed processes. The production cross section of Z(cid:48) reads

is less pronounced for q ¯q compared to gluons, by about a factor of order 3. The decay
channels of Z(cid:48) are similar to those of the SM Z-boson but with an additional channel,

decay branching ratio is from Z(cid:48) → f ¯f and the total width of Z(cid:48) is also very small. However,
for a large enough gZ(cid:48) ∼ 3, not only the dominant channel becomes Z(cid:48) → sa, but also the
width of Z(cid:48) can reach ∼ 45 GeV due to Z(cid:48) → sa decays without any diﬃculty. Therefore
in the following analysis we use gZ(cid:48) ∼ 3 as a representative point. Also notice that since
the branching ratio of Z(cid:48) → sa is close to 1 at that point, the parameter gZ(cid:48) cancels in the
branching ratio and has very small eﬀect on subsequent considerations.

III. RESULTS

A. Geometry of LHC relevant for the diphoton signal

The ATLAS detector can be viewed as a series of ever-larger concentric cylinders around

the beam line. From the inner region to the outer region, the main detector elements are a

silicon pixel and strip tracker, an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), a hadron calorimeter

(HCAL), and a muon spectrometer. A 1/4 of the z view of the detector is demonstrated in

Fig. 5.

inner tracker and ECAL (1/4 of the z view). Other components of the detector are not shown.

The ﬁducial region of inner detector and ECAL are shaded with gray. The ECAL consists of three

layers (see text for details), which we shaded with diﬀerent tones of gray. We also speciﬁc values

for the relevant geometry that used in the analysis. Other relevant parameters of the detector can

be found in Tab. I.

The inner detector tracking system is used to reconstruct primary vertices up to a radius

in the transverse plane (r) less than 0.8 m [105]. Recently, ATLAS has upgraded the inner

detector system and inserted another layer, the Insertable B-Layer (IBL) [106], near the

beam-pipe with 0.03 m < r < 0.04 m to enhance the tracking ability and overcome the

increased pileup at the LHC run-II. Therefore we deﬁne the ﬁducial volume of the inner

detector to be in the region 0.03 m < r < 0.8 m. A photon passing through the ﬁducial

volume of the inner detector can convert into an electron-positron pair, which leaves tracks in

the ﬁducial volume. As a result, such photons are classiﬁed as converted photon candidates

by the ATLAS collaboration.

The ECAL (as well as HCAL) is composed of a barrel and two endcaps. The ATLAS

ECAL is a lead-liqid argon sampling calorimeter. The relevant geometrical parameters of

the ECAL components are summarized in Fig. 5 and Tab. I [107]. The ECAL consists of

three layers, starting at r = 1.5 m. A photon is categorized as an unconverted photon

candidate if it converts inside the region between 0.8 m and 1.5 m, consisting of the ﬁnal

part of the tracking system and a gap between the inner tracker and the ﬁrst layer of the

of the event reconstruction for the converted and unconverted photons are 0.03 m< r < 0.8

m and 0.8 m< r < 1.6 m, respectively. Note that if the second layer of the ECAL is also

included, the ﬁducial volume of the unconverted photons is 0.8 m< r < 1.93 m.

B. Displaced dark mediator decay signal

In order to obtain a more realistic evaluation of Pacc than the one given in Eq. (17),

we need to take into account the distribution of the initial momentum of heavy resonances
(S or Z(cid:48)) aﬀecting the boosts of emerging light particles, which in turns translates into a
distribution of the decay lengths LA(cid:48) or Ls,a.

Diﬀerent production mechanisms for S and Z(cid:48) suggest diﬀerences in their boost factors.
The scalar S is produced through gluon fusion, which means that the initial states are
similarly distributed. On the other hand, in our second example, Z(cid:48) is produced through q ¯q
initial states, which is asymmetric because it is more probable to ﬁnd a quark than an anti-

quark in a proton due to diﬀerences in their parton distribution functions. As a consequence

16

it is more likely that Z(cid:48) will have more of a longitudinal boost compared to S, while for the
latter we ﬁnd that the production-near-rest picture largely holds.

Suppose that the distribution of a heavy resonance initial velocities, or boosts, is given

by f (β). The function satisﬁes normalization condition

f (β)dβ = 1.

(34)

We simulate f (β) using standard MC tools in practice. Furthermore, given the geometry
of the detector is cylindrical, and that all decays of light particles to collimated e+e− pairs
within radial segments (distance from the origin) rmin(θ) < r < rmax(θ) pass the photon

selection criteria, Pacc is proportional to

Given the geometry of the detector and the probability (B14), we can calculate Pﬁd for

both 750 GeV scalar and vector resonance scenarios. We give the results for Pﬁd for the 750

GeV scalar resonance scenario in Tab. II as an example. Pﬁd a function of decay length LA(cid:48).

One can observe that as the decay length grows, the Pﬁd drops precipitously.

TABLE II: Probabilities of dark photon decays inside the ATLAS detector, Pﬁd, for the 750 GeV

scalar resonance scenario. Various decay length Ld and ﬁducial regions are considered. Events with

at least one of the decays occurring inside the tracker volume are categorized as “Converted”. The

“Unconverted 1” category includes events where both dark mediators decay inside the remaining

part of the ﬁducial volume (gap region and the ﬁrst layer of the ECAL). Similarly, the “Converted

1+2” and “Unconverted 1+2” categories are the generalization of the Converted and Unconverted

1 categories by including the second layer of the ECAL into the ﬁducial volume of the event

reconstruction.

From Eq. (35) to obtain the ﬁnal Pacc, we still need to multiple the right hand side by

the acceptance rate and diphoton reconstruction eﬃciency, i.e.,
γ × A × Pﬁd × (Bre+e−)2,

Pacc = 2

(40)

where γ = 95% is the reconstruction eﬃciency for a single photon [1]. The selection cuts
on |η| has already been considered in the calculation Pﬁd. The rest selection cuts in [1] are
as follows:

Eγ1

T > 40 GeV, Eγ2

T > 30 GeV, Eγ1

T /mγγ > 0.4, Eγ2

T /mγγ > 0.3.

(41)

We use Monte-Carlo simulation to implement above cuts and obtain the acceptance A. The
resulting acceptance A (after |η| cuts) is 68% (84%) for 750 GeV scalar (vector) resonance
scenario. Substituting the acceptance and eﬃciency back to Eq. (40), we get Pacc that

consequently yields σSignal through Eq. (6).

that can explain the 750 GeV scalar resonance through faking photons. In the left and right panel,

we vary the parameter αd and λT separately. The solid, dotted, and dashed lines in the left(right)

panel respectively represent parameters corresponding to 30 observed diphoton events for αd = 1,

0.01, and 0.08 (λT = 4π, 4, and 1.3) with a ﬁxed λT = 4π (αd = 1). Other parameters in the

calculation are set to be λd = 2, mψ = 300 GeV and mT = 1 TeV. The purple-gray shaded regions

are excluded by the mono-photon search at the ATLAS [108]. It excludes part of parameter space

for αd = 1, λT = 4π that we marked as purple-gray lines. Nevertheless, the mono-photon search

does not further exclude preferred parameter space for smaller αd and λT values listed in the plot.

In the plot, we also include current constraints and future prospects on the 2 versus mA(cid:48) plane
for dark photons that decay directly to SM particles (see e.g. [96] and reference in §I).

C. Preferred region of light particle parameter space

In this subsection we perform a “fusion” of all diﬀerent components of our calculation

in order to derive the allowed parameter space for light particles. Our strategy is to be

conservative, which means we should allow the largest possible variations in the properties

of the 750 GeV resonance. To that eﬀect, we take the largest possible range for the coupling
that regulates the production of S through the gluon fusion, 0 ≤ λT ≤ 4π. The upper
boundary would correspond to the largest production cross section, and therefore admits

At this point we will also assume that every electron-positron decay

of light particles is going to pass the photon selection criteria. Violation of this assumption
in practice is possible for higher A(cid:48) masses, which would reduce the region of interest on the
 − mA(cid:48) parameter space.

A ﬁxed minimum value for the Pacc has, of course, two solutions in terms of LA(cid:48). If the

decay length is too short, all the decays will happen inside or close to the beam pipe, while
if the decay length is too large, only a small ﬁnite number of A(cid:48) pairs would decay in or
before the ECAL. For the dark photon model, we obtain the allowed region that would be

consistent with our scenario for the 750 GeV resonance. The preferred part of the dark

photon parameter space is shown in Fig. 6 with with mT = 1 TeV, mψ = 300 GeV, λd = 2

while λT and αd are varied. (Notice that this choice of mψ and αd ﬁts the reported width

of a possible 750 GeV resonance). The yellow shaded region is favored by the 750 GeV

resonance. One can also see that the allowed parameter space has a band structure, which
follows from the LA(cid:48) ∝ (mA(cid:48))−2 scaling. Wiggles, deviations and a dip near 1 GeV occurs
due to the enhancement of hadronic decays of A(cid:48) and the reduction of Bre+e−. In the left
panel of the plot λT is set to its maximum value while αd is varied, while on the right

panel αd = 1 and λT is scanned. We observe that as the couplings diminish so does the

allowed part of the parameter space. However, some allowed parameter space still exists for
λT ∼ O(1) or αd ∼ O(0.1). It is also worth mentioning that above mA(cid:48) = 2mµ there is an
appreciable branching to muons, so that one should expect “fake photon” and muon pair,

or two muon pair events appearing in the same model that should reconstruct to the same

invariant mass.

On the whole, one can see that intensity frontier searches cannot fully exclude the sug-

gested region of the model parameter space. It is easy to understand why: in the adopted
LHC scenario, A(cid:48) particles have relatively small mixing angles  ∼ O(10−4), which for most
ﬁxed target searches would not lead to detectable displaced decays. At the same time, it
is too small a coupling to be currently ruled out by the search for “bumps” in the e+e−
spectrum. We also include the exclusion region imposed by the ATLAS mono-photon con-
straints [108]. This constraint comes from the situation when one A(cid:48) decays before or inside
the ECAL faking a photon, while the second A(cid:48) completely escapes the detector before de-
caying. The current limit on the cross section is 6.1 (5.3) fb at 95% C.L. This constraint

will be relevant for the longer LA(cid:48), and this is seen on the left of Fig. 6 with the gray band

20

being parallel but below the yellow one. It is worth mentioning that future intensity frontier

experiments can potentially exclude some part of preferred parameter space in Fig 6. These

projected limits are shown in dashed lines in Fig 6. In addition, with more data collected

with various contours corresponding to  = 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2. The yellow shaded region
are favored by the 750 GeV Z(cid:48) resonance while the gray shaded region is excluded by the
d between 10−10
mono-photon searches with  = 0.2. For ms/a = 0.1 GeV one can have λ2
and 10−8. The allowed range of  in the yellow shaded region is 0.02 (cid:46)  (cid:46) 0.2. The lower
limit is to ensure having enough production cross section while the upper limit comes from
the electroweak precision test [74]. Notice that the model with  < 0.1 and gd (cid:29) g1 is very
diﬃcult to constrain via “conventional” q ¯q → Z(cid:48) → µ+µ− searches due to a small branching
ratio for the Z(cid:48) decay to SM particles, which leads to 4 scaling of the signal.

IV. DISCUSSION

A. Potential methods to exclude models with dark mediators

So far there is only limited amount of data available. However, with more data it is

likely that one can statistically discriminate between real photon events and decays of dark

mediators. While the properties of the photons are of course fully speciﬁed by QED and

atomic physics, the main input parameters for the dark mediator decays will be its energy,

mass and the decay length (such as EA(cid:48), mA(cid:48) and LA(cid:48) as in the dark photon example).

Below we outline important diﬀerences between the conversions of real photons and decays

of dark mediators.

1. Aﬃnity of conversions to the material inside the detector. Photons convert to pairs

in the ﬁeld of the nucleus, and therefore the distribution of conversion points roughly

follows the number density of atoms weighted with the square of the atomic number,

Z 2nA. The dark mediators, on the other hand, can decay anywhere in the detector,

including hollow parts. The distribution of vertices for the converted photon events

should provide a useful discrimination.

21

FIG. 7: Preferred parameter space (yellow shaded) in the λ2

d versus ms/a plane for dark scalars

that can explain the 750 GeV vector resonance through faking photons. The solid, dotted, and

dashed lines represent parameters corresponding to 30 observed diphoton events for  = 0.2, 0.1,

and 0.05, respectively. The purple-gray shaded regions are excluded by the mono-photon search

at ATLAS [108]. It excludes part of parameter space for  = 0.2 that we marked as a purple-gray

line. The mono-photon search does not further exclude preferred parameter regions for  = 0.1

and 0.05.

2. Events beyond the ﬁrst layer of the ECAL. The decays of dark mediators can occur

in the ECAL beyond the ﬁrst layer of the calorimeter, which would correspond to an

unusual penetration depth for a regular photon. In fairness, the probability of decay

within the second or third layer of the calorimeter is not very large for the models

considered, and more data is needed for this criterion to become useful. But even with

current statistics, the searches of “late converting” photons in association with regular

photons is of interest and should be pursued.

3. Distribution of converted vs unconverted events. Exponential dependence on the dis-

tance travelled, for a short decay length Ld, will always enhance the fraction of fake

unconverted events. That is most dark mediators at short Ld will decay before reaching

the ECAL. Therefore this can be a useful criterion for part of the parameter space.

It is well known that the electron-

positron pairs created by Bethe-Heitler process (regular conversion) have an apprecia-
ble fraction of events with asymmetric energy distribution (Ee+ (cid:29) Ee− or Ee− (cid:29) Ee+)
whereas a vast fraction of dark mediator decays has Ee+ ∼ Ee−. This fact is well appre-
ciated in the direct dark photon searches. An abnormally low fraction of asymmetric

pairs could be a signature of dark mediators.

5. Shape and point of origin for the shower. Unconverted photons may have a small but

non-zero penetration depth inside the ﬁrst layer of the ECAL, while dark photons

decaying in the gap between the tracker and the ECAL enter the calorimeter as pairs,

and thus shower immediately. This will aﬀect the shape of the shower, its starting

point, and possibly the energy reconstructed from the standard procedures.

6. Abnormal separation of electron-positron pair.

In this paper we have avoided the

discussion of the drop in eﬃciency for converted and/or unconverted photons when
the mass of the dark mediator become large. When a dark mediator such as A(cid:48)
decays to the electron-positron pair, each electron receives a perpendicular momentum
p⊥ ∼ mA(cid:48)/EA(cid:48). After some distance travelled, this may lead to an abnormally large
separation of electrons and positrons, compared to a similar behavior of a regular

conversion pair, when they cross a layer of the pixel detector and/or reach the ECAL.

Detailed implementation of this criterion should determine the maximum mass for a

dark mediator capable of faking a photon.

We believe that the possibility of dark mediators mimicking real photons deserves a closer

look by the experimental collaborations. A few items outlined above may serve as a basis

for developing a statistical procedure that would emphasize or suppress fake photons vs

real photons and vice versa. It is also worth mentioning that due to the diﬀerence in the

linear sizes of the ATLAS and CMS detectors (hence a diﬀerent sensitivity to Ld), there

can be an additional discriminating power in a combined treatment. Also, it may be that

dark mediator decays create a large number of events that are neglected for one or many

of the above reasons. Therefore a closer look in a sample with loosened criteria for photon

identiﬁcation may also contribute to constraining or validating dark mediator models.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper we have considered the exotic possibility that metastable BSM particles of

low mass could be produced as a result of a heavy resonance decay. Being weakly unstable,

these particles decay to electron-positron pairs that may in fact resemble the conversion

pairs originating from a regular photon. The prime candidates for such metastable particles

are dark photons, as well as light scalars and pseudoscalars, which all have small branchings

to neutrinos and therefore do not generate a large missing transverse momentum signal.

We have examined both possibilities, without imposing very restrictive assumptions on the

properties of the 750 GeV resonance. We have found that the parameter space for light

particles (e.g. the dark photon models prefer a somewhat wide range of parameters along
the mA(cid:48)/(100 MeV) × (/10−4) ∼ O(1) line) that emerges from this analysis is not excluded
by the current limits. However, a number of new proposals at diﬀerent stages of maturity

exists [94, 95, 97, 109, 110] which will eventually probe deep inside the region of interest.

In the models we consider, the mono-photon searches provide an important constraint.

Also, should the light particles be able to decay to muons, a search of two collimated muons

plus a “fake photon” reconstructing to the same invariant mass is a promising search channel.

Irrespective of the future status of the 750 GeV resonance, it seems important for the

experimental collaborators to build statistical discriminators that would allow (given enough

data) to distinguish between regular SM photon events and would-be-photon dark mediator

decays. We have provided a discussion of some avenues along which this problem might be

addressed.

Note added-

As this paper was being ﬁnalized, we became aware of recent preprints [111, 112] that

also have detailed discussions on the possibility that the diphoton resonance may also be

explained by dark mediators mimicking real photon signals, and thus have overlap with some

of the discussions in our paper.

Appendix B: Decay probability with boost eﬀect

In this section, we derive the decay probability of dark mediators in the laboratory frame.

We ﬁrst start with the decay probability in the rest frame of the parent particle S which

can be written as

Pr =

(cid:90)

dW

e−r2/Lr,2dr1dr2,

1
Lr,1

Lr,2

e−r1/Lr,1
d3pr,1δ(|(cid:126)pr,1| − p0).

with

dW =

4πp2
0

(B1)

(B2)

The normalization factor in Eq. B2 is chosen such that W = 1 after carrying out the
integration. p0 (cid:39) mS/2 is the magnitude of the momentum of the daughter particles and
the subscript “r” indicates that the observable is in the rest frame of the parent particle. ri

is the radial coordinate of the dark mediator i. We neglect the mass of the daughter particles

since they are much lighter than the parent particle. The delta function is used to impose

the on-shell condition. Note that the momenta of the two daughter particles are related

28

(cid:126)pr,1 = −(cid:126)pr,2 so the delta function requires both daughter particles to be on-shell. ri and Lr,i
are radial coordinate and the decay length of the daughter particle i (i = 1, 2) in the rest

frame of the parent particle. We also assume that the boost is only along the beam-pipe,

i.e. the z direction. Using a Lorentz transformation one can express the z component of

the momentum of the daughter particle in the rest frame in terms of the observables in the

laboratory frame

pz
r = γ(pz

L − βEL) (cid:39) γ pL(cos θ − β),

(B3)

where pz

L and EL are the z component momentum and the energy of the daughter particle
in the laboratory frame, respectively. The subscript L indicates that the observable is in the

frame. We have used pz

laboratory frame. θ represents the polar angle of the daughter particles in the laboratory
L = pL cos θ and EL (cid:39) pL in the last step. β is the relative velocity
between the rest frame of the parent particle and the laboratory frame. The boost factor

γ = 1/(cid:112)1 − β2. Similarly we obtain the following equations

r = γ(1 − β

(B4)

(B5)

where p⊥ = pL sin θ is the momentum of the daughter particle in the transverse plane. In
the last steps of Eqs. B4 and B5 we have used the relations, p⊥ = pL sin θ and pz

L = pL cos θ.

Therefore the δ function in B2 in the laboratory frame can be written as

δ(|(cid:126)pr| − p0) = δ(pL

sin2 θ + γ2(cos θ − β)2 − p0)

(cid:113)

δ(pL −

(B6)

Likewise, dW in the laboratory frame is as follows

dW =

dpLδ(pL −

× γ(1 − β cos θ)(sin2 θ + γ2(cos θ − β)2)−3/2.

)

(B7)

Furthermore, based on the momentum conservation we know that there are relations between

daughter particles 1 and 2.

r,1 = −pz
pz
r,2,
p⊥,1 = p⊥,2.

29

(B8)

(B9)

This gives rise to

pL,1(cos θ1 − β) = pL,2(cos θ2 − β),

pL,1 sin θ1 = pL,2 sin θ2.

One can solve Eqs. B10 and B11 for cos θ2 and pL,2,

cos θ2 = −β2 cos θ1 − 2β + cos θ1
β2 − 2β cos θ1 + 1

We have used the delta function in the last step of Eq. B14. Note that p0τA(cid:48)/mA(cid:48) is the decay

length of the daughter particles in the rest frame of the parent particle. ri,min and ri,max

are lower and upper boundaries of ri of the ﬁducial volume. θ1,min and θ1,max are lower and

upper boundaries of θ1 of the ﬁducial region. f (β) is the normalized velocity distribution of
