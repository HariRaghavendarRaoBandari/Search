an electric ﬁeld

Abstract

We show, in contradiction to the paper “Trouble with the Lorentz
law of force:
incompatibility with special relativity and momentum
conservation” by Masud Mansuripur, that there is no torque on a
magnetic dipole moving in an electric ﬁeld.

In a Physical Review Letter[1], Masud Mansuripur claimed that a magnetic
dipole moving in an electric ﬁeld would experience a torque, and that this
represented “incontrovertible evidence of the incompatibility of the Lorentz
law with the fundamental tenets of special relativity.” The publication of
Mansuripur’s letter led to a number of comments[2]-[9] presenting various
contradictions of his claim. The combination of his original letter, the sub-
sequent comments, and Mansuripur’s rebuttal[10] constitute a menagerie of
conﬂicting points of view with no conclusive resolution.
In this letter, we
show that Mansuripur’s calculation of the torque on the moving magnetic
dipole is in error, and there is no torque on a magnetic dipole moving in an
electric ﬁeld. Thus, there is nothing to explain away.

In his letter, Mansuripur treated the case of a point charge q a distance
r from a magnetic dipole m, which he considered as a small charge-neutral
loop of current.
Initially, the charge and the magnetic dipole are at rest
in a system S, with no force or torque acting on either the charge or the

magnetic dipole. He then stated that Lorentz transforming the current loop
to a system S′ in which it was moving with velocity V would give it an electric
dipole moment. A good description of this process is given in section 18-4
of[11]. They show how Lorentz transforming the current distribution leads
to an asymmetric charge distribution within the current distribution, leading
to the electric dipole moment.

At this point, Mansuripur made a crucial mistake. He assumed that
the electric ﬁeld E from the point charge acted on the asymmetric charge
distribution within the current density, creating a torque on the moving cur-
rent loop. However, in actuality, the external electric ﬁeld moves conduction
charges within the current distribution to form a surface charge distribution
that keeps the external electric ﬁeld from entering the current distribution.
Consequently, the electric ﬁeld from the point charge is shielded from the
Lorentz induced asymmetric charge distribution within the current distribu-
tion and exerts no force on it.

Thus, there is no torque on a magnetic dipole moving in an external
electric ﬁeld. The many comments on Mansuripur’s letter are endeavoring
to resolve a nonexistent problem.
