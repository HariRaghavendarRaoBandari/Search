Abstract. Let a, b, q be rational numbers such that none of a, b, q, q − a,
q − b, q − a − b is an integer. Then we prove, 3F2(1, 1, q; a, b; 1) is a Q-linear
combination of log of algebraic numbers if {sq} + {s(a − q)} + {s(b − q)} +
{s(q − a − b)} = 2 for all integers s prime to the denominators of a, b and q
where {x} denotes the fractional part of x.

(1.1)

for non-integers a, b, q ∈ Q (the equality follows from Dixon’s formula, [5] Ch. III,
[4]
3.2 (1)). We ﬁrst note that their contiguous relations for a, b and q hold (e.g.
§7.3), so that the complex numbers (1.1) are “essentially” same if we replace a with
a + n etc.

There is a very classical formula of Watson [9] (see also [5] Ex.9, p.98) which

says

2 (cid:19) + ψ(cid:18) b + 1

2 (cid:19) − ψ(cid:16) a

2(cid:17) − ψ(cid:18) b
2(cid:19)

where ψ(x) = Γ′(x)/Γ(x). The special values ψ(α) for α ∈ Q are known by Gauss
([7] 1.7.3, p.18–19). Thus the formula of Watson implies that the unit argument
(1.1) is a Q-linear combination of of ﬁnitely many log(α)’s with α ∈ Q(µ∞) when
2q ≡ a + b mod Z.
On the other hand, the recent work [4] by the ﬁrst and second authors shows
that the left hand side of (1.1) appears as Beilinson’s regulator on the motivic coho-
mology groups of ﬁbrations with multiplication. The third author pointed out that
it also appears from the Fermat surfaces. Under a certain geometric assumption
it is known that the regulator is written by logarithmic function. Thus one can
obtain a suﬃcient condition for that (1.1) are written by logarithmic function. It
is remarkable that our geometrical method covers not only the case of Watson’s

This is distinguished from Watson’s formula also in the sense that non-cyclotomic
numbers appear inside of log.

This paper is organized as follows. The main theorem is stated in §2. We give
two proofs of the main theorem in §3 and §4. The ﬁrst proof uses the motivic
cohomology of ﬁbrations and it is due to the ﬁrst and second authors. The second
one uses the motivic cohomology of the Fermat surfaces, and it is due to the third
author.
In particular, we give a conjecture
on a necessary and suﬃcient condition for that (1.1) is written by logarithmic
function (Conjecture 5.2). This is quite likely true from the viewpoint of Beilinson’s
regulator, though we have no idea how to prove it.

In §5 open questions are discussed.

2. Main Theorem

Let ˆZ = lim
←−n

Z/nZ be the completion, and ˆZ× = lim
←−n

(Z/nZ)× the group of
units. The ring ˆZ acts on the additive group Q/Z in a natural way, and then it
induces ˆZ× ∼= Aut(Q/Z). We denote by {x} := x − ⌊x⌋ the fractional part of
x ∈ Q. The map {−} : Q → [0, 1) factors through Q/Z, which we denote by the
same notation.
Theorem 2.1. Let a, b, q ∈ Q be non-integers such that none of q− a, q− b, q− a− b
are integers. Thinking of q, a, b being elements of Q/Z, we assume that

{sq} + {s(−q + a)} + {s(−q + b)} + {s(q − a − b)} = 2

holds for all s ∈ ˆZ×. Then

(2.2)

Here the right hand side denotes the Q-linear subspace of C generated by 1 and
log α’s, α ∈ Q

(including the case log(1) = 2πi ).

We note that the action of ˆZ on the subgroup 1

quotient (Z/N Z)×. Therefore if a, b, q ∈ 1
over the set of integers k such that gcd(k, N ) = 1 and 0 < k < N .

N Z/Z factors through the ﬁnite
N Z, then it is enough that s in (2.1) runs

3. Proof of Main Theorem : Fibration with Relative Multiplication

The key ingredient of the proof is the regulator formula in [4], which we recall

here. Let

f : X −→ P1

be a ﬁbration equipped with a relative multiplication on R1f∗Q by a number ﬁeld
K which satisﬁes the following conditions. We ﬁx a coordinate t ∈ A1 ⊂ P1.

(a) The rank of the multiplication is two, i.e. dimK R1f∗Q = 2.
(b) f is smooth over P1 \ {0, 1,∞}.
(c) The local monodromy T = T1 on H 1
tent, i.e. the rank of N := log(T ) is 1

B(Xt, Q) at t = 1 is maximally unipo-

Let χ : K ֒→ C be an embedding, and let R1f∗Cχ denotes the χ-part which is
deﬁned to be the subspace on which g ∈ K acts by multiplication by χ(g). Let Tp
be the local monodromy (in counter-clockwise direction) on R1f∗Q at p = 0, 1,∞.
Let (e2πiαχ

Let l ≥ 1 be an integer and π : P1 → P1 the map given by π(t) = tl. Put G(l) :=
Aut(π) ∼= µl. We consider a variation of Hodge structure M (l) := π∗Q ⊗ R1f∗Q
and cohomology groups

H (l) := H 1(P1, j∗M (l)), M (l) := H 1(P1 \ {0, 1,∞}, M (l)).

(3.1)

Put

E := Mp=0,1,∞

Ep, Ep := (R1j∗M (l))p = Coker[Tp − 1 : M (l) → M (l)].

There is an exact sequence

0 −→ H (l) −→ M (l) −→ E −→ 0

(3.3)

of mixed de Rham-Hodge structures and all terms are equipped with the multipli-
cation by the ring K[G(l)].

For k ∈ (Z/lZ)× let εk : G(l) ∼= µl → C be a group homomorphism given by
ζ 7→ ζk. Then εk ⊗ χ deﬁnes a homomorphism K[G(l)] → C of Q-algebra in a
natural way. Let L be the coimage of εk ⊗ χ. Let e ∈ K[G(l)] be the idempotent
associated to L, i.e. e2 = e and eK[G(l)] = L.

belongs to Z. It is not hard to show that eE0 = eE∞ = 0, dimL eH (l) = dimL eE =
1 and eE has the Hodge type (2, 2). Then taking the (ε−k ⊗ χ)-part of (3.3), one
has the connecting homomorphism

ρε−k⊗χ : Q −→ C/Per([eH (l)]ε−k⊗χ) + Q

where Per([eH (l)]ε−k ⊗χ) denotes the period of (ε−k ⊗ χ)-part in the sense of [6] (see

H (l) ∼= Ker[H 2(X (l), Q)/hﬁb.div.i −→ H 2(f (l)−1(t), Q)]

where “ﬁb.div.” denotes the ﬁbral divisors for f (l). Then the regulator maps induces

Proof. Note that there is the canonical isomorphism Ext1(Q, eH (l)(2)) ∼= C/Q(1)⊕
as eH (l) ∼= Q(−1)⊕. Then ρε−k⊗χ can be regarded as the (ε−k ⊗ χ)-part of ρ (cf.
[4], 4.2), and hence it is enough to see that the image of ρ lies in the subspace
)⊕ ⊂ C/Q(1)⊕. Since regD is surjective, it is enough to see that so
(Q + Q log Q

Let N r(X (l)) = Ndim X−r(X (l)) ⊂ H 2r(X (l), Q) be the subspace generated by
algebraic cycles of codimension r. Note that they are generated by cycles deﬁned
over Q. By the assumption eH (l) ⊂ N 1(X (l)). The pairing N 1(X (l))⊗ N1(X (l)) →
Q is non-degenerate by the non-degeneracy of the pairing on the N´eron-Severi
groups. This implies that there is a (not necessarily connected) smooth projective
curve C and a morphism C → X (l) such that the image of C intersects with D(l)
properly and the composition eH (l) → H 2(X (l))/ﬁb.div → H 2(C) is injective.

Proof. The former is a consequence of an explicit formula of the Hodge type of
eH (l) which is proven by the Riemann-Roch-Hirzebruch theorem ([2] §5.5, see also
[4] Lemma 3.1 and Remark 4.2). The latter follows from this and Lemma 3.2. (cid:3)

To prove Theorem 2.1 it is enough to ﬁnd a ﬁbration f and an embedding χ

We do not need to take q into account because k/l can be an arbitrary rational
number. Thus the following lemma ﬁnishes the proof of Theorem 2.1.

Lemma 3.4. Let a, b ∈ Q be non-integers. Then there is a ﬁbration f and an
embedding χ such that a ≡ αχ
Proof. Let N > 1 be an integer. Let 0 < i, j < N , 0 ≤ k < N be arbitrary integers
such that gcd(N, i, j) = 1. We consider the hypergeometric ﬁbration (cf. [1]):

There is the automorphism σ ∈ Aut(Y ) given by σ(x, y, t) = (x, ζN y, t) with
ζN a primitive N th root of unity. Then R1g∗Q has a multiplication by Q[σ] ∼=
Q[T ]/(T N − 1). Let JacY /P1 → P1 be the Jacobian ﬁbration of g. Then we take the
component of it for the projection eN : Q[σ] → Q[σ]/(Φ(σ)) where ΦN (T ) ∈ Q[T ]
is the irreducible polynomial of ζN :

f : X = eN (JacY /P1) −→ P1.

This is the desired ﬁbration. Indeed the general ﬁber f −1(t) is a ϕ(N )-dimensional
abelian varieties ([1] Theorem 6.7), and equipped with multiplication by Q(ζN ).
The periods of f −1(t) are described by the Gauss hypergeometric functions and
hence one has the monodromy representation as the triangulated group of hyper-
geometric functions. In particular one has that the local monodromy T1 at t = 1 is
unipotent and

for some s ∈ (Z/N Z)×. When χ : Q(ζN ) ֒→ C runs over all embeddings, s runs
over all s ∈ (Z/N Z)×. Since αχ
q 6∈ Z for any p, q = 1, 2, the local monodromy
T1 cannot be trivial, and hence it is maximal unipotent. Thus all the conditions
(a), (b) and (c) are satisﬁed. Since i, j can be arbitrary, we are done.

Set (α1, α2, α3, β1, β2) = (a, q, b, a + b, q + 1). Changing the variables x = t1 and
y = (1 − t1)/(1 − zt1t2), one has

where ∆z is an arbitrary domain in uv-plane which corresponds to Ez. Substitute
z = 1. We choose a domain

∆ = ∆1 = {(u, v) ∈ R2 | 0 ≤ u, v ≤ 1, 1 ≤ uN + vN}

Let G = µ3
N be the group which acts on S by σ(u, v, w) = (ζ1u, ζ2v, ζ3w) for
σ = (ζ1, ζ2, ζ3) ∈ G. Let χ : Q[G] → Q be the homomorphism of Q-algebra given
by χ(ζ1, ζ2, ζ3) = ζN (a−q)
. Let K be the coimage of χ, and e ∈ Q[G]
the idempotent corresponding to Q[G] → K (i.e. e2 = e, eQ[G] = K). Let D be a

which is commutative up to sign, where regD and regS are the regulator maps.
Thus the same argument as in the proof of Lemma 3.2 works and we have the
following.
Lemma 4.3. There is a cycle z ∈ H 3
Z∆

uN (a−q)−1vN (b−q)−1wN q−N dudv = ±iη ◦ regS(z) ∈ C/Per(H χ)⊗−1 + Q. (4.8)
In particular, if H = eH2(S) has the Hodge type (−1,−1), it follows from (4.4)
and the fact Per(H χ)⊗−1 = 2πiQ that we have

M (S, Q(2)) such that

B(a, b)3F2(cid:18) a, q, b

a + b, q + 1

; 1(cid:19) ∈ Q + Q log(Q

).

Lemma 4.4. H = eH2(S, Q) has the Hodge type (−1,−1) if and only if

{sq} + {s(−q + a)} + {s(−q + b)} + {s(q − a − b)} = 2

holds for all s ∈ ˆZ×.
Proof. eH2(S, Q) has the Hodge type (−1,−1) if and only if eH 2(S, Q) has the
Hodge type (1, 1). As is well-known, the de Rham cohomology eH 2
dR(S) is generated
by rational 2-forms

ηs := usN (a−q)−1vsN (b−q)−1wsN qdudv,

s ∈ (Z/N Z)×

and ηs belongs to the Hodge (ps, 2 − ps)-component where ps := {sq} + {s(−q +
a)} + {s(−q + b)} + {s(q − a − b)} − 1. Now the assertion is immediate.

(cid:3)

Theorem 2.1 is immediate from Lemmas 4.3 and 4.4.

5. Open Problems

Problem 5.1. Give an explicit description of (2.2) in terms of logarithmic func-
tion.

We obtained explicit descriptions in some cases of (a, b, q) ∈ S (e.g. the example
in §1) by developing the technique in §3 or §4. However there still remains technical
diﬃculties arising from algebraic geometry to compute all cases. We will discuss
this issue in detail in a forthcoming paper.

We propose a conjecture of a necessary and suﬃcient condition for that 3F2 is

written in terms of log:
Conjecture 5.2. Let a, b, q ∈ Q be non-integers such that none of q−a, q−b, q−a−b
are integers. Then

B(a, b)3F2(cid:18) a, b, q

a + b, q + 1

; 1(cid:19) ∈ Q + Q log Q

×

(5.1)

(5.2)

if and only if

{sq} + {s(−q + a)} + {s(−q + b)} + {s(q − a − b)} = 2,

∀s ∈ ˆZ×.

As we have seen before, (5.2) is a necessary and suﬃcient condition for that eH (l)
in §3 or eH in §4 is a Tate motive. Otherwise they contains no Tate motives, and
the complex number (5.1) turns out to be Beilinson’s regulator of an extension of
such a motive. Then it is quite weird if it were written only in terms of logarithmic
function.
