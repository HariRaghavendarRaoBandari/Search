ABSTRACT
Fragmentation of protoplanetary disks due to gravitational instabilities is a candidate
of a formation mechanism of binary stars, brown dwarfs, and gaseous giant planets.
The condition for the fragmentation has been thought that the disk cooling timescale
is comparable to its dynamical timescale. However, some numerical simulations sug-
gest that the fragmentation does not occur even if the cooling time is small enough, or
the fragmentation can occur even when the cooling is ineﬃcient. To reveal a realistic
condition for fragmentation of self-gravitating disks, we perform two-dimensional nu-
merical simulations that take into account the eﬀect of the irradiation of the central
star and radiation cooling of the disk, and precisely investigate the structure of the
spiral arms formed in the protoplanetary disks. We show that the Toomre Q param-
eter in the spiral arms is an essential parameter for fragmentation. The spiral arms
fragment only when Q < 0.6 in the spiral arms. We have further conﬁrmed that this
fragmentation condition observed in the numerical simulations can be obtained from
the linear stability analysis for the self-gravitating spiral arms. These results indicate
that the process of fragmentation of protoplanetary disks is divided into two stages:
formation of the spiral arms in the disks; and fragmentation of the spiral arm. Our
work reduces the condition for the fragmentation of the protoplanetary disks to the
condition of the formation of the spiral arm that satisﬁes Q < 0.6.

INTRODUCTION

The formation of stars requires gravitational collapse of
dense molecular cloud cores. The run-away collapse of the
central dense region in the self-gravitationally collapsing
core results in the formation of the ﬁrst hydrostatic core
of which mass is of the order of 10−2M⊙ (Larson 1969;
Masunaga, Miyama & Inutsuka 1998). The subsequent dy-
namical collapse of the ﬁrst core triggered by the dis-
sociation of molecular hydrogen proceed in a run-away
manner again and result in the protostar of which mass
is of the order of 10−3M⊙ (e.g., Masunaga & Inutsuka
2000). The evolution after the emergence of the protostar
is called the accretion phase. Since the parental molecu-
lar cloud cores have angular momentum (Goodman et al.
1993; Caselli et al. 2002), the infalling material
in the
cloud cores cannot accrete directly onto the protostars, and
thus, the rapidly rotating circumstellar disks are formed
around the protostars. The circumstellar disks are also

called protoplanetary disks since they are supposed to
be the sites of planet formation. Numerical simulations
of formation of protostars and circumstellar disks suggest
that the disks are very massive in its early evolution-
ary phase (cf. Bate 1998; Inutsuka, Machida & Matsumoto
2010; Tsukamoto & Machida 2011). In the massive disk,
spiral arms are formed by the gravitational
instability
(Takahara 1976, 1978; Iye 1978). The angular momentum
of the protoplanetary disks is redistributed by the gravita-
tional torque of the spiral arms and the angular momentum
transfer promotes gas accretion in the protoplanetary disks.

the fragmentation of the disks due to gravitational
in-
stability is the most promising scenario for forming such
planets. The self-gravitational
fragmentation of the cir-
cumstellar disks is also important as a formation process
of multiple systems (Machida et al. 2008; Kratter et al.

Despite its importance in the formation of stars and
planets, the criterion of the gravitational fragmentation is
still controversial. The gravitational stability is character-
ized by Toomre Q parameter:

Q ≡

csΩepi
πGΣ

,

(1)

where cs is the sound speed, Ωepi is the epicyclic frequency,
and Σ is the surface density of the disk. When the grav-
itationally unstable disks are formed and satisfy Q ∼ 1,
the spiral arms are developed in the disks. Then the disks
are heated by the shock of the spiral arm, and the surface
density is redistributed by the angular momentum transfer
due to the gravitational torque. These eﬀects make the disks
gravitationally stable. As a result, the self-gravitating disks
are self-regulated to the marginally stable Q ∼ 1 condition.
Thus we need physical mechanisms that make the disk un-
stable overcoming the stabilization.

Gammie (2001) ﬁrstly showed that the fragmentation
can happen when the disk cooling timescale is compara-
ble to its dynamical timescale with two-dimensional local
shearing box simulation. This is so-called the cooling crite-
rion. In Gammie (2001), the cooling rate is modeled with
the cooling time τc, and the criterion of the fragmenta-
tion is that the normalized cooling time β ≡ τc/Ω satisﬁes
β . 3. Rice, Lodato & Armitage (2005) have shown that
the cooling criterion given by Gammie (2001) is consistent
with the results of the three-dimensional global simulations.
Meru & Bate (2011) have questioned, however, that the nu-
merical convergence of βcrit is not reached in previous stud-
ies. Lodato & Clarke (2011) have suggested that the conver-
gence of βcrit is strongly aﬀected by the heating due to the
artiﬁcial viscosity. The value of βcrit depends on the artiﬁcial
viscosity: Rice et al. (2014) and Meru & Bate (2012) have
indicated that βcrit converges to ∼ 8 and ∼ 30, respectively.
Because the cooling criterion is simple and useful, many the-
oretical works on the evolution of the protoplanetary disks
have used this condition (e.g. Raﬁkov 2005).

(2010); Machida, Inutsuka & Matsumoto
and
Machida, Inutsuka & Matsumoto (2011b) show that the
fragmentation can occur even with very stiﬀ EOS. On the
other hand, Kratter et al. (2010) shows that the fragmenta-
tion does not occur with isothermal EOS, which corresponds
to very small cooling time, and Tsukamoto et al. (2015)
shows the cases in which the fragmentation does not
occur even if the cooling time is small enough. More-
over, some previous studies have claimed that there is
no universal βcrit. They have indicated that the con-
dition of the fragmentation depends on the disk mass
(Kratter, Matzner & Krumholz 2008; Kratter et al. 2010)
and external
irradiation (Kratter et al. 2010), and that
fragmentation have a stochastic nature (Paardekooper
2012; Young & Clarke 2015, 2016). Therefore, the simple
cooling criterion for the disk fragmentation is not always
reliable in the realistic situations.

To ﬁnd a reliable condition for disk fragmentation, we
have to investigate the physical process of the fragmenta-
tion precisely. For this purpose, we divide the process of
self-gravitational fragmentation of disks into two stages: the
formation of spiral arms in the disk and the fragmentation
of the spiral arms. The nature of spiral arms formed in non-
liner growth phase of GI disk depends on numerous factors
such as the temperature, mass, and radius of the disk. Thus,
it seems to be highly diﬃcult to predict the nature of spi-
ral arms formed in disk by few parameters. On the other
hand, as we describe bellow, the fragmentation condition
of the spiral arms is surprisingly simple. In this work, we
show that fragmentation of the spiral arms is described by
“gravitational instability of spiral arm”. We ﬁnd that the
condition for the gravitational instability of the spiral arms
is given by Q < 0.6 in the spiral arms. Figure 1 shows the
ﬂowchart of the fragmentation process of the disk. In this
paper, we mainly discuss the fragmentation process of the
spiral arms.

We perform two-dimensional numerical simulations tak-
ing into account the eﬀect of the external radiative heating
and local radiative cooling. We conﬁrm that the normalized
cooling time β cannot predict whether a disk fragments or

not in our simulation and show that fragmentation of a disk
is closely related to Q parameter in spiral arms. This paper is
organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the numerical
method. In Section 3, we show the results of our simulations
and propose the relation between the gravitational fragmen-
tation and minimum Q parameter in the disk. We conﬁrm
the relation found in the numerical simulations by the lin-
ear stability analysis of the self-gravitating spiral arms in
Section 4. In Section 5, we compare our result with previous
papers and discuss the formation processes of the fragments.
We also discuss the relation between the accretion of the gas
in the disks and the condition for the fragmentation. We
make conclusions of this work in Section 6.

where Σ is surface density, v is velocity, E is internal energy
per unit area, P is the vertically integrated pressure, Φ is
the gravitational potential, ΛC is the cooling rate per unit
area. We calculate Φ with the thin disk approximation. We
assume an ideal gas equation of state,

P = (γ − 1)E,

where γ is the ratio of speciﬁc heat. We adopt γ = 5/3 in
this calculation. The temperature is given by

where µ is the mean molecular weight, kB is the Boltzmann

This modeling approximates to the result of Semenov et al.
(2003) in T . 200 K. In our simulations, the temperature
is smaller than 200 K except for fragments. We assume Text
as follows (cf. Chiang & Goldreich 1997);

Text = max(cid:20)T100(cid:16) r

100au(cid:17)−3/7

, 10K(cid:21) ,

(9)

where we adopt T100 = 20.8 or 83.4K as the temperature at
r = 100 au.

2.2 Numerical procedure and Initial conditions

We use two-dimensional polar grid (r, φ). The inner and
outer boundaries are r = Rin and 1000 au, respectively.
Open boundary conditions are used for the inner and outer
boundaries. The radial and azimuthal grid numbers are 512
and 1024, respectively, and the radial spacing is logarith-
mic. The mass of central star is M∗ = 0.5M⊙ and we take
into account the motion of the central star by including the
indirect potential. The radial and azimuthal components of
the self-gravity are smoothed over a softening length. We
adopt a softening length 0.012r or 0.03r, which is larger
than the cell size so as to reach the numerical convergence
(cf. Young & Clarke 2015). The inﬂuence of the softening
length is discussed in Section 3.6.

Initial surface density and temperature proﬁles are

given by

Σ = Σ100(cid:16) r

100au(cid:17)−12/7
T = 4T100(cid:16) r

exp(cid:18)−
100au(cid:17)−3/7

.

r

rdisk(cid:19) ,

(10)

(11)

where rdisk is the outer edge of the disk. We adopt here
rdisk = 250 au. With these initial conditions, the initial value
of Q is almost uniform for r < rdisk. Initial radial velocity
is set to be zero, and initial rotational velocity is given so
as to satisfy the force balance in the radial direction. The
parameters explored in our simulations are summarized in
Table 1.

We deﬁne Qini and Qext for describing the initial and

typical Q parameter for each model as,

Qini =

cs(Tini)Ωep,ini

πGΣini

,

Qext =

cs(Text)Ωep,ini

πGΣini

.

(12)

(13)

Fig. 2 shows the distribution of Qext and Qini for model
S199k005. Since Qini & 2, the protoplanetary disks are grav-
itationally stable at t = 0. In initial stage of the simulation,
the temperature of the disks decreases to ∼ Text due to
the radiative cooling, and the distribution of Q parameter
is roughly converged to Qext. Then disks become gravita-
tionally unstable for a global mode and the spiral arms are
formed.

We add small level (=0.1 per cent) of white noise to the

initial surface density.

3 RESULTS

We calculate the evolution of the disks until about 1.4× 105
yr, which corresponds to the 10 orbital periods at r = 100
au.

3.1 No fragmentation case

3.1.1 Time evolution

Fig. 3 shows the radial distribution of the azimuthally
averaged surface density, temperature, angular frequency,
and Toomre Q parameter for model S199k005 in Table 1.
In model S199k005, fragmentation does not happen. Thus
smooth, quasi-steady structure is realized. The surface den-
sity in the inner region (r . 40 au) decreases rapidly because
of the inner boundary. The eﬀect of the inner boundary is
discussed in Section 3.5. The averaged surface densities in
the region r & 40 au changes slightly from the initial surface
density because of formation of spiral arms in the disk. The
temperature of the disk decreases rapidly, and the tempera-
ture distributions are roughly given by Text (Equation (9)).
The temperature around 50 au is a little bit larger than Text
due to shock heating by spiral arms. The averaged angular
velocity is slightly diﬀerent from that of Kepler rotation be-
cause of self-gravity and the pressure gradient of the disk.
The angular velocity proﬁle does not signiﬁcantly change in
time. The averaged Toomre Q parameter is roughly given

by Qext at t = 2857 yr and after that Q is sustained for
∼ 2. The tendency that the averaged Q parameter remains
nearly constant in self-gravitating disks is realized in many
previous works.

3.1.2 The structures of the spiral arm

We perform the detailed analysis of spiral arms to investi-
gate the condition for fragmentation. Fig. 4 shows the struc-
ture of the spiral arm at t = 7571 yr for model S199k005.
The left top panel of Fig. 4 shows the map of surface den-
sity. The green squares trace the spiral arm that we focus
on. The large green squares show the centers of the spiral
arm and the small green squares show the edge of the spiral
arm. The centers of the spiral arm are obtained by following
the peak of the surface density. The separation between the
large green points is 0.1r. The edge of the spiral is deﬁned
as the point where the surface density is 0.3 times the sur-
face density at the center of spiral arm. The other panels in
Fig. 4 show the distribution of the physical values along the
spiral arm. The horizontal axis s is the distance along the
spiral arm. The origin of s is the large green point whose
radius is the minimum. The right top panel shows the width
of the spiral arm and the scale height cs/Ω evaluated at the
center of the spiral. The width of the spiral arm is about
twice the scale height for s . 150 au and comparable to the
scale height for s & 150 au. The left bottom panel shows the
line mass of the spiral arm. The line mass of the spiral arm is
approximately given by c2
s /G. Since the line mass is smaller
than the critical line mass 2c2
s /G, the spiral is supported by
the pressure against the self-gravity in the direction perpen-
dicular to the spiral arm. The right bottom panel shows the
normalized cooling time and the optical depth τ . We show
two diﬀerent normalized cooling times that are deﬁned as
follows;

where βcooling indicates the time scale by the radiative cool-
ing, and in βnet include the eﬀect of external heating. Since
the cooling is eﬃcient and the temperature of the spiral arm
T is very close to or smaller than Text, βnet is very large or

negative at s ∼ 150 au. The spiral arm is optically thick and
the cooling time is roughly proportional to T −1.

3.1.3 Comparison with cooling criterion

According to the cooling criterion, the spiral arm fragments
when the cooling time is small enough. Although there is a
controversy on the critical value of the normalized cooling
time βcrit, the proposed values are all larger than 3. In the
spiral arm shown in Fig. 4, however, satisﬁes βcooling < 3 for
s & 50 au but does not fragment. This result clearly con-
tradicts the cooling criterion proposed in previous works.
One may argue that βnet should be used for the criterion. In
this case, this disk does not satisfy the criterion. However,
we will show examples that satisfy βnet and does not frag-
ment in Section 3.8. In this way, we can see that the cooling
criterion is not always valid.

3.2 Fragmentation case

3.2.1 Time evolution

In model S265k005, whose initial disk mass is about 1.3
times larger than that of S199k005, the fragmentation oc-
curs in the spiral arms. Fig. 5 shows the radial distribution
of the azimuthally averaged surface density, temperature,
angular velocity and Toomre Q parameter. The fragments
are formed between t = 2857 and 5714 yr. The surface den-
sity in the inner region (r . 40 au) decreases by the rapid
accretion through the inner boundary. However, since the
fragmentation occurs at the radius r ∼ 100 au, the eﬀect
of the inner boundary does not aﬀect the fragmentation.
After the fragmentation occurs, the angular momentum is
eﬃciently transferred by the fragments, promoting rapid gas
accretion onto the central star. After the fragmentation, the
temperatures of the fragments are much higher than Text,
but the temperature of the disk is almost same as Text. The
opacity model (Equation (8)) is relevant when T < 200 K,
and the disk temperature satisfy this condition except in
the fragments. The averaged distribution of Q parameter
is roughly given by Qext before the fragmentation. On the
other hand, after the fragmentation, the gas of the disk is
disturbed by the fragments and the square of epicycle fre-
quency becomes negative in some regions. Thus Q is not
deﬁned in such regions.

To investigate the fragmentation process of the disk, we per-
form the numerical simulation in which the initial disk mass
is larger than that of model S199k005.

Fig. 6 shows the time sequence of the surface density
of the disk for model S265k005. The circumference of the
white ﬁlled circle shows the inner boundary. In Fig. 6, the

green squares. The right top panel shows the width of the spiral arm and the scale height cs/Ω evaluated at the center of the spiral. The
left bottom panel shows the line mass of the spiral arm. The right bottom panel shows the normalized cooling time βcooling and βnet

three fragments are formed in the two spiral arms. Fig. 7
shows the time sequence of the temperature distribution in
the disk for model S265k005 at the same epochs as in Fig. 6.
The structures of the spiral arms are less clear in the tem-
perature plot than that in the surface density plot because
the spiral heating is weak. In particular, the structures of the
temperature are almost axisymmetric in the region r & 100
AU indicating that the temperature is determined by exter-
nal heating.

3.3 Condition for fragmentation of the spiral arms

Fig. 8 shows the structure of the spiral arm at 4285 yr for
model S265k005. This spiral arm fragments at ∼ 5 × 103
yr (Fig. 6). The width of the spiral arm is comparable to
the scale height and the line mass of the spiral arm is ap-
proximately given by c2
s /G. In the region s & 100 au, the
normalized cooling time in the spiral arm is β ∼ 2 and sim-
ilar to that of model S199k005 shown in Fig 4. Thus, it is
diﬃcult to distinguish these two spiral arms by the normal-
ized cooling time.

What is an essential parameter of fragmentation? We
propose that a local Q parameter in a spiral arm is the crit-
ical parameter that controls fragmentation of spiral arms.
Fig. 9 shows Q parameter in the spiral arms shown in Fig.

8 and 4. The minimum Q parameter in the spiral arm for
model S265k005 is about 0.5 and the minimum Q param-
eter in the spiral arm for model S199k005 is about 0.8.
From the results of numerical simulations that we perform
in this work, we ﬁnd that the spiral arms fragment when
Q < 0.6 is satisﬁed. We have examined this condition by
using many runs that include both fragmenting spiral arms
and non-fragmenting spiral arms and found that this con-
dition Q . 0.6 for the fragmentation of the spiral arms is
valid for all the spiral arms that we examined. These re-
sults indicate that the Q parameter in the spiral arms is an
essential parameter for the fragmentation process of disks.
In Section 4, we show that the condition for Q parameter
can be derived from the linear analysis for the gravitational
instability of the tightly wound spiral arm.

3.4 Relation between normalized cooling time

and fragmentation

In this section, we investigate the relation between the nor-
malized cooling time and fragmentation and show that nor-
malized cooling time does not determine the condition of
fragmentation. We perform the numerical simulation of hot-
ter disks than that of model S199k005 and S256k005 to
investigate whether the gravitational fragmentation occurs

when β in the spiral arms decrease. Note that βcooling ∝ T −1
in optically thick spiral arms (see Equation (15)). The tem-
peratures of the disks are roughly equal to Text. Thus we can
control the temperature of the spiral arms by Text. In model
S431Tx4, S497Tx4, and S563Tx4, the external temperature
is higher by a factor of 4 than that of model S265k005. The

surface densities are also elevated to make the disks gravi-
tationally unstable.

at t=4999 years. This spiral arm does not fragment even
with small β. The width of the spiral arm is larger than 20
AU. The Q parameter at the center of the spiral is larger
than 0.75 and the absence of fragmentation is consistent

with our criterion for the fragmentation Q . 0.6. Since the
temperature of the spiral is large, the cooling rate is also
large. As a result, the minimum normalized cooling time in
the spiral arm is about unity. Although βcooling and βnet
in the spiral arm in model S563Tx4 is smaller than that
of model S265k005, the spiral arms in model S563Tx4 do
not fragment and the spiral arms in model S265k005 frag-
ment.Note that Qext of the model S563Tx4 is smaller than
that of model S265k005 since the initial surface density of
the disk in model S563Tx4 is about 2.1 times larger than
that of model S265k005.

Rice et al. (2011) gives the relation between βcrit and
external irradiation by the local two-dimensional numerical
simulations. Their results suggest that βcrit increases as Qext
decreases. On the other hand, the results of S265k005 and
S563Tx4 suggest that the βcrit decreases as Qext decreases.
Thus, our results conﬂict with the results of local simulations
done by Rice et al. (2011). This indicates that the critical
value of normalized cooling time depends not only on Qext
but also on other parameters of the disk, for example, the
temperature, the total disk mass, and the radius. Therefore,
it seems quite diﬃcult to obtain the critical cooling time
that can be universally applied for all disks.

the spiral arm for model Rin50. In this case, the minimum Q
in the spiral arm is ∼ 0.7 and the spiral arms in model Rin50
do not satisfy the condition of the fragmentation Q . 0.6.
In this way, the result of simulation depends on the inner
boundary condition but our condition for the fragmentation
still remains valid. Thus we see that our condition for the
fragmentation is not aﬀected by the inner radius and the
inner boundary condition.

3.6 Inﬂuence of disk thickness

Since we use the two-dimensional numerical simulation code,
we do not calculate the vertical structure of the disk. In
general, the thickness of the disk aﬀects the self-gravity
of the disk. We model the eﬀect of the thickness of the
disk by using the softening length of the self-gravity. By
including the gravitational softening, the small scale gravi-
tational interaction within the softening length is smoothed.
Using this property, we can mimic the smoothing eﬀect in-
troduced by the scale height on the gravitational force. In
the case that we adopt the softening length 0.012r, the crit-
ical Q parameter for the fragmentation is ∼ 0.6, as dis-
cussed so far. To investigate the dependence on the soft-
ening length, we perform the simulations for the softening
length 0.03r (model S265sft003, S298sft003). The parame-
ters of model S265sft003 are the same as S265k005 except

3.5 Eﬀect of inner boundary

In the simulations performed in this work, the surface den-
sity in the inner region decreases quickly in the early evolu-
tion because of the rapid accretion through the inner bound-
ary. To investigate the eﬀect of our inner boundary, we per-
formed simulations in which the inner radii are diﬀerent from
model S265k005. Those runs are labelled Rin5 and Rin50.
The inner radii of models Rin5 and Rin50 are 5 au and 50
au respectively, while the inner radius of model S265k005 is
20 au. The fragmentation does not occur if the inner radius
is very large (model Rin50). Fig. 11 shows the structures of

the softening length, but fragmentation does not occur in
model S265sft003. This result indicates that fragmentation
is diﬃcult when the softening length is large. Fig. 12 shows
the structures of the spiral arm of model S265sft003. Since
the minimum value of Q is larger than 0.6, this result is
consistent with our condition for the fragmentation. Fig. 13
shows the structures of the spiral arm of model S298sft003
in which the fragmentation occurs. In this case, the mini-
mum value of Q is about 0.5. Thus this spiral arm satisﬁes
our criterion. Therefore, the results are also consistent with
our condition for the fragmentation.

In this work, we investigate the eﬀect of the thickness
of the disks on the conditions for the fragmentation by using
the softening length. The pre-deﬁned softening length, how-
ever, cannot completely capture the physics of ﬁnite thick-
ness disks. Young & Clarke (2015) suggests that βcrit may
be underestimated in two-dimensional numerical simulation.
Therefore, we need the three-dimensional simulation to pre-
cisely evaluate the more realistic value of the critical Q for
the fragmentation of spiral arms.

3.7 Dependence on opacity

The disk cooling rate depends on the opacity. Since most
of the regions of the disks are optically thick, the cooling
rate is proportional to κ−1
R . Thus, the radiation cooling is

eﬃcient when κR is small. To investigate the dependence of
the condition of fragmentation on the cooling rate, we per-
form the simulations with κ10 and Σ100 diﬀerent from Model
S265k005. Additional models of parameters are listed in Ta-
ble 2. In models S265k05, S265k025, S265k01, and S265k001,
the initial surface density is as same as that of S265k005,
but the opacity at T = 10 K, κ10, is 0.5, 0.25, 0.1, and
0.01 [cm2g−1] respectively. The results of model S265k005,
S265k05, S265k025, S265k01, and S265k001, suggest that
the fragmentation occurs in the case that the opacity is small
and the radiation cooling is eﬃcient if the other parameters
are the same. Fig. 14 shows the structures of the spiral arm
in model S265k05, which does not fragment. In the spiral
arm, the minimum value of Q is larger than 0.6 and the fact
that this spiral arm does not fragment is consistent with
our condition. In this case, the opacity is an order of mag-
nitude larger than the opacity of model S265k005, and the
normalized cooling time is βcool & 10. In the case that the
opacity is large, the spiral arms cannot shrink enough to sat-
isfy Q . 0.6. In this sense the eﬃcient cooling is important
for the fragmentation of the spiral arms.

Fig. 15 shows the classiﬁcation of the simulation results
on the κ10 − Σ100 plane. We also plot the result of the adia-
batic calculations in which radiation cooling is shut oﬀ. The
initial temperature of the adiabatic calculation is the same
as Text. In the case that the opacity is small, the fragmen-
tation occurs for the small initial surface density since the

optical depth in the spiral arms are larger than unity and
the cooling rate increases with decreasing the opacity. The
critical value saturates at Σ100 ∼ 20 [g cm−2] in low opacity
limit. The fragmentation occurs even in the adiabatic sim-
ulations when Σ100 & 30 [g cm−2]. Fig. 16 shows the radial
distributions of Qext for Σ100 = 16.7 and 33.1 [g cm−2]. In
the case that Σ100 . 16.7 [g cm−2], Qext is larger than about
2, and the amplitude of the surface density of the spiral arms
is too small to fragment independently of the opacity. In the
case that Σ100 & 33.1 [g cm−2], Q ∼ 1 is satisﬁed and disks
fragment independently of the opacity.

3.8 Summary of counter-examples for cooling

criterion

In our simulations, we ﬁnd many counter examples for cool-
ing criterion. In this subsection, we summarize the results
that conﬂict with the cooling criterion. Fig 17 shows the
results that the spiral arms do not fragment although they
satisfy the cooling criterion. In Fig. 17, the top panels show
the surface density of the simulations and the bottom pan-
els show βnet and βcool in the spiral arms shown by green
points in the top panels. The models are S563Tx4 (left),
Rin50 (middle), S265sft003(right). In the spiral arms, βnet
and βcool are order unity, but the spiral arms do not frag-
ment. Especially, as described in Section 3.4, the result of
S563Tx4 conﬂicts with the relation between βcrit and ex-
ternal irradiation obtained from local simulation done by
Rice et al. (2011).

Moreover, all the results of adiabatic simulation in
which the fragmentation occurs are the counter examples for

the cooling criterion. These spiral arms fragment although
the cooling time is inﬁnitely large. These results strongly
suggest that the cooling criterion is neither a necessary con-
dition nor a suﬃcient condition for fragmentation of massive
irradiated protoplanetary disks. Thus we need a diﬀerent cri-
terion for gravitational fragmentation. The criterion for the
fragmentation of spiral arms obtained in this work may pro-
vide an important clue for ﬁnding more useful criterion for
fragmentation of protoplanetary disks.

4 ANALYTICAL CONSIDERATION

In Section 3, we proposed a new criterion for fragmentation
of spiral arms: spiral arms fragment when Q parameter in-
side the spiral arms becomes Q < 0.6. In this section, we
perform the local linear stability analysis and show the cri-
terion is also obtained analytically. Since the pitch angles
of fragmenting spiral arms are small, we approximate spiral
arms as rotating rigs around central stars. We also assume
that the wavenumber k is small compared with the radius
of the ring and ignore the curvature of the ring. Then the
linear stability analysis of the ring is similar to that of the
ﬁlament except for the eﬀect of rotation. We adopt the local
radial and azimuthal coordinate (x, y). We take into account
the perturbations proportional to exp[iky − iωt] and we use
the linearised equations as follows:

− iωδML − ikMLδvy = 0,

− iωδvx = 2Ωδvy,

We can rewrite this relation by using Q parameter. The

f or l. The critical Q and most unstable wavenumber as
functions of f are shown in Fig. 20. The relation between
Qcrit and f is ﬁtted by

Qcrit ≈ −0.11f−1.3 + 0.744.

(32)

The critical Q and most unstable wavenumber as functions
of l are shown in Fig. 21. Fig. 20 shows that in the case that
f ∼ 1, the critical Q parameter for the instability is about
0.6. This result is consistent with the results of the numer-
ical simulation performed in this work. This result shows
that the condition of gravitational fragmentation of the pro-

toplanetary disks is given by the condition of the gravita-
tional instability of the spiral arms formed in the disks. The
Q parameter used in this analysis is deﬁned by local values
of Σ, cs, and Ω. When we apply this criterion to realistic
systems, we should use the minimum Q parameter in the
spiral arm.

5 DISCUSSION

5.1 Comparison with previous work

The normalized cooling timescale has been considered to be
a critical parameter for the fragmentation of the protoplan-
etary disks (Gammie 2001; Rice, Lodato & Armitage 2005;
Raﬁkov 2005; Kratter & Murray-Clay 2011). As shown in
this paper, however, the cooling timescale cannot be used as
a useful criterion to predict the stability of the disk against
self-gravitational fragmentation. In this section, we compare
our results with the results of previous work.

The discrepancy may come

from the diﬀerence
of the disk masses. Since previous numerical simula-
tions on protoplanetary disk formation suggest
that
the initial disk mass is comparable to or larger than
the central star mass (Inutsuka, Machida & Matsumoto
2010; Machida, Inutsuka & Matsumoto 2010, 2011b,a, 2014;
Inutsuka 2012), we adopt the massive disk as initial con-
ditions (for example, initial disk mass of S265k005 is ≈
0.38M∗). Lodato & Rice (2005) have pointed out that the
nature of the spiral arm in the massive disk is diﬀerent from
that of less massive disk. The scale height of a marginally
unstable disk (Q ∼ 1) increases as the disk mass increases,
because the temperature of the disk increases when Q is
ﬁxed and Σ increases (cf. Bertin & Lodato 1999). As a re-
sult, grand design spiral arms with wavenumber m ∼ 2 are
formed in a massive disk. On the other hand, in the previous
studies on the cooling criterion, tiny spiral arms with large
m are formed in the disks because the disk mass is much
smaller than the central star mass. Since the disk mass af-
fects the nature of the spiral arms formed in the disks, the
diﬀerence in the disk mass may aﬀect the property of frag-
mentation. Moreover, Kratter et al. (2010) have performed
the three-dimensional numerical simulation of disk forma-

tion and pointed out that the condition for fragmentation
of the disk depends on the disk mass. These previous stud-
ies have suggested that the condition for fragmentation de-
pends on the disk mass and it will be one of the reasons
why the cooling criterion cannot predict the fragmentation
of the disks observed in this work.

this simpliﬁcation, temperatures of spiral arms continue

the cooling
timescale determines disk fragmentation. On the other
hand, in realistic situations, stellar irradiation provides the
dominant energy source except for inner region (see Fig.
3). Moreover, the disks can be heated by the radiation
from the inner disks even when the radiation from the
central star is neglected (Tsukamoto et al. 2015). Thus the
external irradiation cannot be neglected in the investigation
of a realistic criterion of gravitational
fragmentation of
disks. In realistic case, the temperatures of the spiral arms
are roughly given by the balance between the external
irradiation and the radiative cooling, and the thermal
pressure can support the spiral arms without heating by
gravitational
instability. Therefore, β cannot predict the
disk fragmentation in the irradiated disks.

Stamatellos & Whitworth (2008) have shown a certain
set of non-fragmenting disks that do not satisfy the cool-
ing criterion, and Stamatellos & Whitworth (2009) have
shown a certain set of fragmenting disks that satisfy the
cooling criterion. Indeed, if we choose the disks that are
plotted near the boundary between fragmentation and
non-fragmentation in Fig. 15, they might appear virtually
consistent with the cooling criterion. However, this does not
mean that the cooling criterion is a meaningful criterion. We
can ﬁnd many counter-examples for the cooling criterion.
In other words, the previous work only considered limited
parameter space that does not include cases inconsistent
with the cooling criterion. In this way, we can understand
the diﬀerence in the conclusions.

There is other previous work that is consistent with
our conclusion. Tsukamoto et al. (2015) showed an ex-
ample that the disks do not fragment even when the
disks satisfy the condition for the cooling rate. On the
other hand, the fragmentation occurs even in the case
where almost adiabatic equation of state is adopted (e.g.
Machida, Inutsuka & Matsumoto 2010, 2011b). Thus the
condition that the cooling timescale is smaller than the crit-
ical value is neither suﬃcient nor necessary conditions for
the fragmentation of the disk.

Tsukamoto et al. (2015) suggest that the critical Q pa-
rameter for the fragmentation is Q ∼ 0.3 and smaller than
our result, 0.6. This diﬀerence would come from the deﬁni-
tion of Q: in Tsukamoto et al. (2015), angular velocity Ω is
used to calculate Q instead of Ωepi. Our numerical experi-

Condition for disk fragmentation

ments show that in self-gravitating disk, Ω and Ωepi can be
largely diﬀerent.

Cossins, Lodato & Clarke (2009) investigate the rela-
tion between β and surface density perturbations δΣ ≡
Σ − Σ, where Σ is azimuthal averaged surface density. The
relation has been obtained from global three-dimensional
simulations;

δΣ
Σ ∼

√β

.

(33)

Cossins, Lodato & Clarke
(2009) have also mentioned
βcrit ∼ 4 meaning that the critical surface density pertur-
bation is δΣ ∼ 0.5Σ. This result may be understood by our
criterion for fragmentation of spiral arms. The quasi-steady
disk satisﬁes the azimuthally averaged Q parameter ∼ 1.
If the diﬀerence between Q in the spiral arm and averaged
Q parameter comes from the surface density perturbation
(this means that the rotation proﬁle and temperature in the
spiral arm are almost the same as the averaged value), the
Q in the spiral arm is given as

Qspiral =

csΩepi

πG(Σ + δΣ) ≈ 0.67

(34)

This value is similar to the critical Q value obtained in this
work. This suggests that the condition for fragmentation of
spiral arms found in this work can also explain the previous
studies that use simple cooling function and neglect external
irradiation.

Paardekooper (2012) performed the two-dimensional,
local numerical simulations similar to the simulation per-
formed by Gammie (2001), but the integration time is longer
than Gammie (2001). They found that there is no sharp
boundary in the cooling time between disks in which frag-
mentation occurs and disks in which fragmentation does not
occur. This is because fragmentation is a nonlinear outcome
of gravitational instability and depends sensitively on an ini-
tial condition. Such a nature of the fragmentation also ap-
pears in our results. For example, the fragmentation occurs
in model S215k005 and does not occur in model S232k005,
although initial surface density of model S215k005 is smaller
than that of model S232k005. We conjecture that the actual
boundary of fragmentation and non-fragmentation in Fig.
15 is not simple but possibly fractal in the limit of long
timescale evolution.

In many previous calculations on the cooing criterion,
they ﬁxed an initial surface density and changed the nor-
malized cooling time β. They correspond to our calculations
that the initial surface density is ﬁxed and opacity is changed
in Fig. 15. Fig. 15 shows that if the opacity is small and the
radiative cooling is eﬃcient, the spiral arms easily satisfy
the condition for the fragmentation proposed in this work.
However, it is diﬃcult to obtain the critical cooling timescale
quantitatively from such calculations since the criterion for
the gravitational fragmentation depends strongly on the sur-
face density but weakly on the cooling timescale, which is
visible as a gentle slope of the boundary between fragmen-
tation and non-fragmentation in Fig. 15.

Rogers & Wadsley (2012) have proposed “Hill crite-
rion” for fragmentation of spiral arms. They approximate
that the mass of the fragment formed in the spiral arm is
2RML, where ML is the line mass and 2R is the width of
spiral arms. They claimed that the spiral arms fragments

Q . 0.7f−1/2.

(37)

Fig. 23 shows the relation between the critical Q parameter
and f obtained by Equation 37. We also show the critical
Q parameter of the gravitational instability of rings. Both
criteria give similar results around f ∼ 1.2. Since f ∼ 1 is
realized in fragmenting spiral arms in our simulations, our
numerical results seem consistent with Rogers & Wadsley
(2012). However, there is a remarkable diﬀerence of these
two critical Q parameters in the case that f is small. For
ﬁxed Q parameter, spiral arms are gravitationally unstable
if f is large since large f means strong gravitational force.
On the other hand, spiral arms satisfy Hill criterion if f
is small since small f for ﬁxed Q means small spiral width.
However, it seems diﬃcult that fragmentation occurs in such
spiral arms since they are gravitationally stable.

5.2 Formation of spiral arms that satisfy the

condition of fragmentation

This work reveals that Q parameter in the spiral arm is
essential for gravitational fragmentation of protoplanetary
disks: fragmentation occurs when Q < 0.6 in the spiral arm.
Thus we can divide the process of fragmentation into two
stages: formation of spiral arms due to global gravitational

instability of protoplanetary disks; and fragmentation of spi-
ral arms due to gravitational instability of the spiral arms.
Our work gives the criterion for the fragmentation in the
second stage. Therefore, our work reduces the condition for
the fragmentation of the disks to the condition for formation
of spiral arms that satisfy Q < 0.6.

There are some variations in the formation processes of
the spiral arms that satisfy the condition for fragmentation
Q < 0.6. In the case that disks are massive enough and Q is
small, two spiral arms are formed in a dynamical timescale.
The outer parts of the spiral arms are tightly wound and
they collide each other. By this collision, the surface densi-
ties become large enough to satisfy the condition Q < 0.6
around the collided region. In the case that disks are less
massive, the formation process of the spiral arms that sat-
isfy the condition Q < 0.6 takes a long time and is more
complicated. For example, we show the fragmentation pro-
cess of the spiral arm of model S265k005 shown in Fig. 8.
This spiral arm collide another one at about 4000 yr and
the high-surface density region is formed in the spiral arm.
However, the condition Q < 0.6 is not satisﬁed in this re-
gion and the fragmentation does not occur immediately. The
spiral arm propagates outward (vr > 0 in the most of the
region in this spiral arm) and the high-surface density region
also moves outward. After that, the region satisﬁes the con-
dition Q < 0.6 and then the spiral arm fragment. In these
cases, the collision and propagation of the spiral arms are
important for the process of the fragmentation of the spiral
arms.

After the fragmentation, spiral arms are formed through
gravitational interaction between the fragments and the disk
gas. An additional fragmentation often occurs in such spiral
arms. In this case, the fragments formed initially accrete
onto the central stars and the fragments formed secondly
often survive. Thus such a sequential fragmentation may be
important for the formation process of the gas giant planets
or binary systems.

Previous

theoretical work on the

self-gravitating
protoplanetary disks used the one-dimensional accre-
tion disk model
(cf. Zhu, Hartmann & Gammie 2010;

Takahashi, Inutsuka & Machida 2013; Bae et al. 2013). To
conveniently describe possible fragmentation process in such
a simpliﬁed protoplanetary disk model, the criterion for the
fragmentation given by the azimuthally averaged value is
required. To obtain the criterion, we need further analysis
on the formation and propagation process of the spiral arms
that satisfy Q < 0.6.

6 CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we investigated the physical process of self-
gravitational fragmentation of protoplanetary disks to clar-
ify the reliable criterion of the fragmentation. We per-
formed both two-dimensional numerical simulations of self-
gravitating protoplanetary disk and linear stability analysis
for gravitational instability of spiral arms. We took into ac-
count external irradiation from a central star to obtain a
realistic criterion. We found that the fragmentation occurs
when the spiral arms satisfy Q . 0.6. We conducted numer-
ous simulations by changing parameters of the opacity, the
external radiation, the inner radius, and the softening length
of the disks and conﬁrmed that this criterion is always valid.
We have further conﬁrmed that this fragmentation criterion
can be obtained from the linear stability analysis of self-
gravitating spiral arms.

Our results showed that the cooling criterion (Ωτc .
O(1)) is neither a necessary condition nor a suﬃcient condi-
tion for fragmentation of massive, irradiated protoplanetary
disks. We obtain many examples in which the fragmenta-
tion does not occur even if the cooling time is small enough.
On the other hand, we found the cases in which the frag-
mentation occurs even if we adopt an adiabatic EOS (inﬁnite
cooling time). In all cases, the results are consistent with our
condition for fragmentation of spiral arms (Q < 0.6). Our
results suggest that the Q parameter in the spiral arms is
more essential parameter than the normalized cooling time
for fragmentation of spiral arms. We can divide the process
of fragmentation into two stages: the ﬁrst stage corresponds
to the formation of spiral arms and the second their frag-
mentation. Our work provides a clear criterion for the sec-
ond stage: the condition for the fragmentation of the disks
is given by the condition for formation of spiral arms that
satisfy Q < 0.6.
