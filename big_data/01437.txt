Abstract

We ﬁnd optimality conditions for testers in discrimination of quantum channels. These conditions
are obtained using semideﬁnite programming and are similar to optimality conditions for POVMs
obtained by Holevo for ensembles of quantum states. We get a simple condition for existence of an
optimal tester with any given input state with maximal Schmidt rank, in particular with a maximally
entangled input state and we show the pitfalls of using input states with not maximal Schmidt rank. In
case when maximally entangled state is not the optimal input state an error estimate is obtained. The
results for maximally entangled input state are applied to covariant channels, qubit channels, unitary
channels and simple projective measurements.
Introduction

1

Let H,K be ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert spaces and
let C(H,K) denote the set of all channels B(H) →
B(K), that is, completely positive linear maps
preserving the trace. Let Φ1, . . . , Φn ∈ C(H,K)
be given and assume that a channel Φ is known
to be one of Φ1, . . . , Φn, with prior probabilities
λ1, . . . , λn. The task of multiple hypothesis test-
ing is to ﬁnd a procedure that determines the true
channel, with the greatest possible probability of
success.

A most general scheme for such a procedure is
given by a triple (H0, ρ, M ), where H0 is an an-
cilla, ρ ∈ S(H ⊗ H0) is a (pure) input state and
M = {M1, . . . , Mn} is a positive operator valued
measure (POVM) on B(K ⊗ H0), which is a se-
quence of positive operators summing up to the
identity operator I. For i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, the value

Tr Mi(Φ ⊗ id)(ρ)

is interpreted as the probability that Φi is chosen
when the true channel is Φ. The average success
probability is then

p(M, ρ) = Xi

λiTr Mi(Φi ⊗ id)(ρ)

(1)

The task is to maximize its value over all triples
(H0, ρ, M ).

It had been observed in [11] that using entangled
input states may give greater success probability
and it was shown in [13] that every entangled state
is useful for some channel discrimination problem.
However, there are situations when e.g. the max-
imally entangled input state does not give an op-
timal success probability. It is therefore important
to ﬁnd out whether an optimal scheme with a given
input state exists. A related problem was studied
in [12].

In the broader context of generalized decision
problems, conditions for existence of an opti-
mal scheme with an input state having maximal
Schmidt rank were found in [10].
In the present
paper, we show that such conditions can be ob-
tained using the methods of semideﬁnite program-
ming and we pinpoint the pitfalls of input states
with not maximal Schmidt rank. Moreover, in the
case that the condition is not fulﬁlled for maximally
entangled input state, we give an upper bound on
the optimal success probability. In the special case
of discrimination of two channels, we obtain a rela-
tively simple condition for existence of an optimal
scheme with a maximally entangled input state,

1

which we call the MEI condition. We also discuss
a number of applications and examples, including
discrimination of covariant channels, qubit chan-
nels, unitary channels and simple projective mea-
surements.

2 Optimality conditions

An alternative description of a channel measure-
ment is given in terms of process POVMs [16] (or
testers [4], see also [8]). A process POVM is a
collection F = {F1, . . . , Fn} of positive operators
in B(K ⊗ H) with Pi Fi = I ⊗ σ for some state
σ ∈ S(H). For any triple (H, ρ, M ), there is a pro-
cess POVM F such that for all Φ ∈ C(H,K),

Tr Mi(Φ ⊗ id)(ρ) = Tr C(Φ)Fi,

(2)

for all i = 1, . . . , n. Here C(Φ) is the Choi repre-
sentation of Φ, given by [5] as

|i i ⊗ |i i,

C(Φ) = (Φ ⊗ id)(|ψH ih ψH|), ψH = Xi
{|i i} is a ﬁxed orthonormal basis of H. Conversely,
for any process POVM F , one can ﬁnd some H0, a
pure state ρ and M such that (2) holds [16].
Using the description by process POVMs, we will
show that the maximization of the success proba-
bility can be written as a problem of semideﬁnite
programming:

max

F∈B(Cn⊗K⊗H)

Tr CF

s.t. Tr F = dim(K),

Tr (I ⊗ Xi)F = 0,
F ≥ 0.

i = 1, . . . , m,

Here C = Pn

is any basis of the (real) linear subspace

i=1 |i ih i| ⊗ λiC(Φi) and X1, . . . , Xm

L := {X = X∗ ∈ B(K ⊗ H), Tr KX = 0}.

To see this, note that according to (2), equation (1)
can be rewritten as:

p(M, ρ) = Xi

λiTr C(Φi)Fi.

Let us take additional n dimensional Hilbert space
i=1 |i ih i| ⊗ Fi ∈

Cn and deﬁne operator F = Pn
B(Cn ⊗ K ⊗ H). Then:
Tr CF = Xi

λiTr C(Φi)Fi

and the problem of maximizing p(M, ρ) can be un-
derstood as problem of maximizing Tr CF . We

have TrCnF = Pi Fi = I ⊗ σ and from Fi ≥ 0 it
follows F ≥ 0. Note that since C is block-diagonal,
we may extend the maximization over all positive
elements F ∈ B(Cn ⊗ K ⊗ H) with TrCn F = I ⊗ σ,
σ ∈ S(H) (and not only over block-diagonal ones).
To rewrite this to the more usable form stated
above, we need to note that TrCn F = I ⊗ σ with
Tr σ = 1 if and only if Tr F (I⊗X) = 0 for all X ∈ L
and Tr F = dim(K). To prove this statement, let
us ﬁrst assume that TrCn F = I ⊗ σ, then

Tr F (I ⊗ Xi) = Tr XiTrCn F = Tr Xi(I ⊗ σ)

= Tr σTrKXi = 0

and Tr F = Tr TrCn F = Tr I ⊗ σ = dim(K).
Conversely, assume that Tr F (I ⊗ X) = 0 for
First note
all X ∈ L and Tr F = dim(K).
that every operator A ∈ B(K ⊗ H) can be ex-
pressed in the form A = Pj AK,j ⊗ AH,j, where
AH,j ∈ B(H) and AK,j ∈ B(K).
If we consider
B(K) as a Hilbert space with Hilbert-Schmidt in-
ner product, then there is an orthonormal basis
{d−1I, χK,1, . . . , χK,N} in B(K), where each χK,j is
a self-adjoint operator such that Tr χK,j = 0. With
respect to this basis, each X ∈ L can be expressed
as:

X = I ⊗ XH,0 +Xj

χK,j ⊗ XH,j

with some XH,i ∈ B(H). From the condition
TrKX = 0 we obtain XH,0 = 0. Expressing
TrCn F = I ⊗ FH,0 +Pj χK,j ⊗ FH,j and using the
condition Tr F (I ⊗ X) = 0 we get

Tr (XH,jFH,j) = 0,

∀j > 0.

Since there is no restriction on XH,j for j > 0,
we must have FH,j = 0 for all j > 0, and hence
TrCn F = I ⊗ FH,0 = I ⊗ σ. To conclude the proof,
from the condition Tr F = dim(K) we get Tr σ =
1. Moreover, it is worth realizing that from the
condition F ≥ 0 we get σ ≥ 0, hence σ ∈ S(H).
ming (see e.g. [2]), one can obtain the following:

Using standard results of semideﬁnite program-

Theorem 1. Let ˆF be a process POVM. Then ˆF
is optimal if and only if there is some λ0 ≥ 0 and
some Φ0 ∈ C(H,K), such that for all i,

λiC(Φi) ≤ λ0C(Φ0)

and

(λ0C(Φ0) − λiC(Φi)) ˆFi = 0,

∀i.

bility is

y = (y1, . . . , ym) ∈ Rm, then dual problem is:

and (I ⊗ C′) ≥ λ−1C ≥ 0. Hence there is some
channel Φ ∈ C(K,H), such that C′ = C(Φ). From
the condition λ(I ⊗ C(Φ)) ≥ C we obtain

λC(Φ) ≥ λiC(Φi),

(3)

for all i. From here we see, that the dual problem
may be formulated as:

min

Φ∈C(H,K)

min{λ, λiC(Φi) ≤ λC(Φ), ∀i}.

Now let F ′ =

n dim(H) I, then F ′ is a primal fea-
sible plan. Moreover F ′ belongs to the interior of
the cone of positive operators, therefore by Slater’s
condition we obtain that the duality gap is zero, in
other words max Tr CF = min λ or Tr C ˆF = λ0,
where by ˆF we denote the primal optimal plan
and by λ0, y0, Φ0 we denote the dual optimal plan.

Since ˆF is feasible, we have λ0 = Pm

Tr (λ0C(Φ0) − λiC(Φi)) ˆFi = 0.

As λ0C(Φ0) − λiC(Φi) ≥ 0 and ˆFi ≥ 0, the sum
may be zero if and only if all summands are zero.

Moreover the only positive matrix with zero trace
is the zero matrix, so we obtain:

(λ0C(Φ0) − λiC(Φi)) ˆFi = 0,

∀i.

(5)

On the other hand, the condition (3) must hold
for any dual feasible plan, but if for some primal
and dual feasible plans the condition (5) holds, then
the duality gap for these plans is zero and they are
optimal. This concludes the proof.

id)(ρ) for all i and

Using this result, we can characterize optimal
measurement schemes, such that the input state
has maximal Schmidt rank, as follows:
Corollary 1. Let ρ ∈ S(H ⊗ H) be a pure state
such that Tr1ρ =: σ is invertible. Then a measure-
ment scheme (H, ρ, M ) is optimal if and only if
(i) Z := Pi λiMi(Φi ⊗ id)(ρ) majorizes λi(Φi ⊗
(ii) Tr KZ ∝ σ.
Proof. For an optimal process POVM ˆF it must
hold that (λ0C(Φ0) − λiC(Φi)) ˆFi = 0, ∀i, which is
equivalent to λ0C(Φ0) = Pi λiC(Φi) ˆFi(I ⊗ σ−1).
We have I = TrKC(Φ0) ∝ TrKPi λiC(Φi) ˆFi(I ⊗
σ−1). There is an operator Aρ such that I ⊗
Aρ|ψH i = ρ, A∗ρAρ = σ, see [16], which implies
exists. We obtain C(Φi) ˆFi(I ⊗ σ−1) = (I ⊗
A−1
A−1
ρ )(Φi ⊗ id)(ρ)Mi(I ⊗ (A∗ρ)−1), where Mi is the
POVM corresponding to the optimal measurement.
Now it is easy to see that TrKPi λiC(Φi) ˆFi(I ⊗
σ−1) ∝ I is equivalent to TrKZ ∝ σ and λ0C(Φ0) ≥
λiC(Φi) is equivalent to Z ≥ λi(Φi ⊗ id)(ρ) for all
i.

ρ

Note that (i) is an optimality condition for a
POVM in discrimination of the ensemble {λi, ρi},
where ρi = (Φi ⊗ id)(ρ), [9]. In other words, if ˆM
is an optimal POVM for this ensemble and

ˆZ := Xi

λi(Φi ⊗ id)(ρ) ˆMi,

the majorization ˆZ ≥ λi(Φi ⊗ id)(ρ) is satisﬁed.
It follows that the existence of an optimal scheme
with the given input state is equivalent to the con-
dition (ii). Clearly, in this case, (H, ρ, ˆM ) is the
optimal scheme and the optimal success probabil-
ity is popt = Tr ˆZ.

Next, we show that the conditions of Corollary 1

are necessary for a general pure input state.

Corollary 2. Let ρ ∈ S(H ⊗ H) be a pure state
such that Tr1ρ =: σ. Then a measurement scheme
(H, ρ, M ) is optimal only if the the conditions (i),
(ii) from the previous corollary hold.

Proof. We will show that this problem is equivalent
to some problem with maximal Schmidt rank input
state. Let us denote Hσ the support of σ. Since
the input state ρ is pure, it must be of the form
ρ = |ψ ih ψ| = Pi,j pξiξj|i ih j| ⊗ |˜i ih ˜j| for some
Schmidt decomposition of |ψ i. From here we see
that ρ ∈ H′σ ⊗ Hσ instead of H ⊗ H, where H′σ is a
subspace isomorphic to Hσ. Hence this problem is
equivalent to a problem formulated only on H′σ ⊗
Hσ, where σ is invertible. The rest follows from the
previous corollary.

This result is comparably weaker than Corollary
1. That is because if we limit the problem only
to the some subspace Hsub of the original Hilbert
space H, then in general we don’t have a guaran-
tee that the optimal input state will be a state on
Hsub ⊗ Hanc, this depends on the properties of the
channels.
We will next present an upper bound for popt in
the case that condition (ii) is violated. We assume
that the input state ρ is maximally entangled, but
a similar bound can be obtained for any input state
having a maximal Schmidt rank.

= Pi λiC(Φi)Mi,
Theorem 2. Let Z
pMEI = dim(H)−1Tr Z, where M is an opti-
mal POVM for discrimination of the ensemble
{λi, dim(H)−1C(Φi)}. Let k·k denote the operator
norm. Then the optimal success probability popt
satisﬁes

pMEI ≤ popt ≤ kTrKZk.

Proof. Note that pMEI is the largest success prob-
ability that can be obtained by the input state ρ,
this implies the ﬁrst inequality. Further, note that
we have λiC(Φi) ≤ Z by optimality of the POVM
M . If now λ > 0 and Φ ∈ C(H,K) are such that
Z ≤ λC(Φ), then λ,Φ correspond to a dual feasible
plan, hence popt ≤ λ by (4). To obtain the tightest
upper bound in this way, we put

λ′0 := inf

Φ∈C(H,K)

inf{λ > 0, Z ≤ λC(Φ)}.

By the Choi isomorphism, there is some completely
positive map ξ : B(H) → B(K), such that Z =

4

C(ξ). As it was shown in [10] (see Corollary 2 and
Section 3.1), λ′0 = kξk⋄, where the diamond norm
is deﬁned as

kξk⋄ =

sup

τ∈S(H⊗H)k(ξ ⊗ id)(τ )k1.

Moreover, since ξ is completely positive, this norm
simpliﬁes to
λ′0 = kξk⋄ = sup
ψ∈S(H)
= sup

Tr Z(I ⊗ ψ)

Tr TrK[Z]ψ = kTrKZk.

Tr ξ(ψ) = sup

ψ∈S(H)

ψ∈S(H)

In general, the bound that we obtain in this way
does not have to be meaningful, that is, it may
happen that kTrKZk > 1. But, as will be demon-
strated by the examples in the last section, there
are cases when the bound is meaningful, or even
tight.
Remark 1. Note that if TrKZ = cI, then c = pMEI
and the value of ǫ := kp−1
MEI TrKZ − Ik indicates
how much the condition (ii) is violated. It is easy
to see that kTrKZk ≤ (1 + ǫ)pMEI, this shows that
if ǫ is small, the maximally entangled state is close
to optimal.

3 Discrimination of two chan-
nels by maximally entangled
input states

Using the well known form of an optimal POVM
for discrimination of two states, we obtain a simple
condition for existence of an optimal scheme with
a maximally entangled input state ρ. So let n = 2
and put Ci = C(Φi), i = 1, 2. The average success
probability as deﬁned by equation (1) is:

p(M, ρ) = Tr ∆λM + (1 − λ),

where

∆λ = λC1 − (1 − λ)C2,

λ ∈ (0, 1).

The optimal POVM is {M, I − M}, where M is the
projection onto the support of the positive part of
∆λ. We obtain

Z = Xi

λiMiCi = (1 − λ)C2 + (∆λ)+

and

4 Applications

pMEI = dim(H)−1Tr Z =

1
2

(1 + dim(H)−1Tr|∆λ|).

Corollary 3. An optimal measurement scheme
(H, ρ, M ) with a pure maximally entangled input
state ρ exists if and only if the Choi operators sat-
isfy

Tr K|∆λ| ∝ I.

(MEI)

Proof. By the remarks below Corollary 1, such a
scheme exists if and only if Tr KZ ∝ I, equivalently,
TrK(∆λ)+ ∝ I. Since we always have TrK∆λ ∝ I
and

(∆λ)+ =

1
2

(∆λ + |∆λ|),

the condition can be rewritten as stated.

The following corollary describes the error esti-

mate.

Corollary 4. We have the following bounds

pMEI ≤ popt ≤

1
2

(1 + kTrK|∆λ|k) .

If the condition (MEI) is satisﬁed, the inequalities
become equalities.

Proof. We only have to note that if the (MEI)
condition is satisﬁed, then dim(H)−1Tr|∆λ| =
kTrK|∆λ|k.
Remark 2. It is well known that popt is related to
the diamond norm as popt = 1
2 (1 + kΦk⋄), where
Φ = λΦ1 − (1 − λ)Φ2. To our knowledge, the only
known bounds on the diamond norm in terms of
the Choi matrices are the following

dim(H)−1kC(Φ)k1 ≤ kΦk⋄≤ kC(Φ)k1,

(see e.g. [3, Lemma 6]) which is quite coarse. As in
Remark 1, we obtain from Corollary 4 the following
new upper bound:

kΦk⋄≤ kTrK|C(Φ)|k ≤ (1 + ǫ′) dim(H)−1kC(Φ)k1,
where ǫ′ = k dim(H)
TrK|C(Φ)| − Ik. This shows
kC(Φ)k1
that if (MEI) is nearly satisﬁed, the above bounds
are quite precise.

We apply the results of the previous section to
the problem of discrimination of covariant chan-
nels, unitary channels, qubit channels and measure-
ments.

4.1 Covariant channels

Let G be a group and let g 7→ Ug ∈ U(H) and
g 7→ Vg ∈ U(K) be unitary representations. As-
sume that Φ1 and Φ2 are covariant channels, that
is,

Φi(U∗g AUg) = V ∗g Φi(A)Vg,

where A ∈ B(H), g ∈ G, i = 1, 2.
Irreduciblity of U plays a strong role, as we will
see. To demonstrate the diﬀerence, let us assume
that the representation g 7→ Ug is reducible. Then
there exists two disjoint proper subspaces of H
that are invariant under the operators Ug and the
projectors on these subspaces, denote them P1, P2,
commute with the operators Ug, for all g ∈ G, see
e.g. [1]. This implies, that for any k1, k2 ∈ R:

AdU t

g

(k1P1 + k2P2) = k1P1 + k2P2.

If the representation U is irreducible, then the only
non-zero projector that commutes with all Ug is I.

Proposition 1. Let Φ1, Φ2 be covariant channels,
then the condition (MEI) is satisﬁed if the repre-
sentation g 7→ Ug is irreducible.
Proof. For U ∈ U(H), let

AdU (A) = U∗AU, A ∈ B(H)

and let U t denote the transpose with respect to the
ﬁxed basis {|i i}. Let Φλ = λΦ1 − (1 − λ)Φ2. For
g ∈ G,

AdU t
g (Tr K|∆λ|) =
= Tr K(id ⊗ AdU t
= Tr K|Φλ ⊗ AdU t
= Tr K|(Φλ ◦ AdUg ⊗ id)(|ψH ih ψH|)|
= Tr K(AdVg ⊗ id)(|∆λ|) = Tr K|∆λ|.

g )(|∆λ|)
)(|ψH ih ψH|)|

g

Since g 7→ U t
TrK|∆λ| must be a multiple of the identity.

g is irreducible, this implies that

5

In case the representation U is reducible, let us
sketch an error estimate. According to previous we
must have

TrK|∆λ| = Xi

kiPi

where ki ∈ R and Pi are projections onto the sub-
spaces of the irreducible representation, orthogo-
nal sum of which is U . Note that Pi does not
have to be one-dimensional
in the general case

but Pi Pi = I must hold. Let ti = Tr Pi then
pMEI = 1

2 (1 + dim(H)−1Pi tiki) and we have

popt ≤

1

2 (cid:16)1 + max

i

ki(cid:17) .

4.2 Qubit channels
Let H = K = C2 and let us denote ψH =: ψ2. Let
Γ(X) = (Tr X)−X t be the Werner-Holevo channel,
where X t denotes the transpose map with respect
to the canonical basis |0 i,|1 i. Then Γ is a unitary
channel, given by the unitary U such that

U|0 i = −|1 i,

U|1 i = |0 i.

It is easy to see that (id ⊗ Γ)(|ψ2 ih ψ2|) = (Γ ⊗
id)(|ψ2 ih ψ2|) and that for a self-adjoint X ∈
B(C2), Γ(X) = X t if and only if X ∝ I. More-
over, if φ : B(C2) → B(C2) is a linear map such
that there is some a ∈ R, satisfying

Tr φ(X) = aTr (X),

X ∈ B(C2),

(6)

then

φ ◦ Γ(X) = Γ ◦ φt(X) + (Tr X)(φ(I) − aI),

where φt(X) = φ(X t)t. Let Φ1 and Φ2 be two qubit
channels and let Φλ = λΦ1 − (1 − λ)Φ2. Then Φλ
satisﬁes (6) with a = 2λ− 1 and since C(Φλ) = ∆λ
we have

Γ(TrK|∆λ|) =TrK(id ⊗ Γ)(|∆λ|)

=TrK|(Φλ ⊗ Γ)(|ψ2 ih ψ2|)|
=TrK|(Φλ ◦ Γ ⊗ id)(|ψ2 ih ψ2|)|
=TrK|(Γ ◦ Φt
λ ⊗ id)(|ψ2 ih ψ2|)
+ (Φλ(I) − (2λ − 1)I) ⊗ I|

=TrK|(Φt

λ ⊗ id)(|ψ2 ih ψ2|)

+ ((2λ − 1)I − Φt

λ(I)) ⊗ I|

=[TrK|∆λ + ((2λ − 1)I − Φλ(I)) ⊗ I|]t

Thus we have proved

6

Proposition 2. For a pair of qubit channels, the
condition MEI holds if and only if

TrK|∆λ + ((2λ − 1)I − Φλ(I)) ⊗ I| = TrK|∆λ|.
In particular, this is true if Φλ(I) = (2λ − 1)I.
If both channels are unital, this is true for any λ.
If λ = 1
2 , then the condition MEI is satisﬁed if
Φ1(I) = Φ2(I), even if the channels are not unital.

4.3 Unitary channels

Let U, V ∈ U(H) and let Φi = AdU , Φ2 = AdV be
the corresponding unitary channels. Put

|φi = dim(H)−1/2Xi
|ψ i = dim(H)−1/2Xi

U|i i ⊗ |i i,

V |i i ⊗ |i i,

so that dim(H)Pφ = C1, dim(H)Pψ = C2 are the
Choi matrices. By the results of the Appendix, it is
clear that Tr1|∆λ| ∝ I if and only if Tr1(z|φih ψ| +
¯z|ψ ih φ|) ∝ I, where

z = h φ, ψ i = dim(H)−1Xi
= dim(H)−1Tr U∗V

h U ei, V ei i

and

Tr1|φih ψ| = Tr1(Xi,j

|U i ih V j| ⊗ |i ih j|)

= Xi,j

h j, V ∗U i i|i ih j| = (V ∗U )t.

Put W = V ∗U , then we see that MEI holds if and
only if

(Tr W )W t + (Tr W )(W t)∗ ∝ I.

Since the transpose is a linear map and I t = I, the
last condition is equivalent to

Tr (W )W + Tr (W )W ∗ ∝ I

(7)

Let us now look and the condition (7). Let
λ1, . . . , λn, n = dim(H), be the eigenvalues of W
(including multiplicities). Let |Tr W| = |Pi λi| =:
c. It is quite clear that the condition is satisﬁed if
c = 0. Suppose c > 0. Put zk := (Pi λi)λk, then

(7) is equivalent to

zk = x + iyk,

∀k,

for some x, yk ∈ R. Since |zk|2 = c2 = x2 + y2
must have y2
where d ≥ 0 and ǫk ∈ {0, 1}. Note further that

k, we
k = c2−x2 =: d2, so that yk = (−1)ǫk d,

yk = Xk

zk = |Tr W|2

= c2 = Re (X zk) = nx

We will consider the special case where M and N
are simple projective measurements, that is, Mi =
Pξi and Ni = Pηi for some ONB’s |ξi i and |ηi i in
H. We will also assume that λ = 1
2 .
Proposition 4. Assume that Pξj = Pηj for some
j. Then the condition MEI is satisﬁed if and only
if M = N .

so that we must have x = c2

Proof. In this case, the condition is

|Pξi − Pηi| = Xi6=j

|Pξi − Pηi| ∝ I

Suppose d = 0, then yk = 0 and zk = x for all
k, so that λk = Tr (W )
for all k. It fol-
lows that U = eiθV , so that both channels are the
same. Hence we must have d > 0.
In this case
#{k, ǫk = 0} = #{k, ǫk = 1} =: m, so that, in par-
ticular, n = 2m must be even. Then W has only
two eigenvalues,

each with multiplicity m. It is now easy to prove
the following:
Proposition 3. Put W = V ∗U and let λ ∈ (0, 1).
Then MEI holds if and only if either Tr W = 0 or
W has at most two diﬀerent eigenvalues, each of
the same multiplicity.

Note that if dim(H) is odd, MEI holds iﬀ Tr W =
Tr V ∗U = h ψ, φi = 0, in which case the two chan-
nels are perfectly distinguishable.

4.4 Simple projective measurements

A special case of a channel is a measurement, which
is given by a POVM M = (M1, . . . , Mm). The
corresponding channel ΦM : B(H) → B(Cm) is
deﬁned as

A 7→ Xi

(Tr MiA)|i ih i|

and the Choi matrix has the form C(ΦM ) =
i . Let Φ1 = ΦM , Φ2 = ΦN for two
POVM’s M , N with m outcomes. In this case, the
condition MEI has the form

Pi |i ih i| ⊗ M t

Since |Pξi − Pηi| ≤ P ⊥ξj
= P ⊥ηj for all i 6= j, this can
be true only if P|Pξi − Pηi| = 0, that is, M = N .

From now on we will always assume that
for all
|h ξi, ηi i| < 1, equivalently, Pξi
i. Then |Pξi − Pηi| = ciPξi,ηi, where ci =
(1 − |h ξi, ηi i|2)1/2 and Pξi,ηi is the projection onto
span{ξi, ηi}, so that the condition MEI becomes

6= Pηi ,

ciPξi,ηi = dI,

d = 2 dim(H)−1Xi

(8)

Note that if dim(H) = 2, then Pξi,ηi = I, so that
the condition trivially holds. In this case, ΦM and
ΦN are unital qubit channels, so that this follows
also by previous results. Put
|ξ⊥i i = c−1
Then Pi := Pξi,ηi = Pξi,ξ⊥
The condition (8) is equivalent to

i = 1, . . . , dim(H)
= |ξi ih ξi| + |ξ⊥i ih ξ⊥i |.

where C = diag (c1, . . . , cn), is invertible. Indeed,

|h ηj, ξj i| = 1, which is a contradiction. Hence

d − cj > 0 for all j and dI − C is positive deﬁ-
nite.
Let us begin from (9). Let us denote Wij =

straightforward to see, that

so the condition (9) becomes

(d− cj)δkj = Xi

(1− δki)Wkic−1

(1− δij)W ∗ij , (10)

which can be written as a matrix equation of the
form
dI − C = (W − diag (W )) C−1 (W ∗ − diag(W ∗)) .
(11)
At this point we are ready to settle the case

dim(H) = 3.
Proposition 5. Let dim(H) = 3, then the (MEI)
condition holds if and only if the matrix W , deﬁned
as above, has of one of the following forms

W1 = 

W2 = 


for ϕi ∈ R. In other words, one POVM is a cyclic
permutation of the other.

Proof. Consider the equation (10) and let j 6= k,
then we obtain

0 = Wkic−1

i

¯Wji,

(12)

for i 6= j 6= k 6= i. By putting i = 1, 2, 3, we obtain
0 = W31 ¯W21 = W12 ¯W23 = W23 ¯W13. It follows that
some oﬀ-diagonal elements of the matrix W must
be zero. On the other hand, for k = j the equation
(10) becomes

d − cj = Xi6=j

Wjic−1

i

¯Wji

(13)

which shows that some oﬀ-diagonal elements must
be non-zero.

First, let us assume, that W12 = 0, then from
equation (13) by setting j = 1 we see W13 6= 0,

8

which by the conditions obtained from equation
(12) means that W23 = 0. That in turn from con-
dition (12) for j = 2 gives W21 6= 0, which again
by (12) gives W31 = 0, from where by (13) for
j = 3 we obtain W32 6= 0, from which by con-
dition (12) we get W12 = 0, which was the as-
sumption. This shows that assuming that one oﬀ-
diagonal element of W is zero leads to a closed
chain of implications that other oﬀ-diagonal ele-
ments must be zero or strictly non-zero. Since
W has to be a unitary matrix, from the condition
W W ∗ = I we get W11 = W22 = W33 = 0 and
|W21| = |W32| = |W13| = 1. We conclude that in
this case W is of the form W1 and the basis |ξi i
and |ηj i are just cyclic permutations of each other,
modulo phase change.
If we assume W13 = 0 then by the same logic
as above we ﬁnd that W is of the form W2, which
is just the other possible cyclic permutation of the
basis, modulo complex phase.

Since we are only interested in projectors on the
basis |ηi i we can set the phases of the vectors in
such way that h ξi, ηi i ∈ R and h ξi, ηi i ≥ 0. To
prove this it is only needed to see that the change
|ηj i → eiϕj|ηj i can be in terms of matrix W ex-
pressed as Wij → eiϕj Wij , hence it can written
as W → W D, where D = diag (eiϕ1 . . . eiϕdim(H) ).
Since diag (W D) = diag (W )D it is easy to see that
equation (11) is invariant under these transforma-
tions. Therefore we may assume that the matrix
diag (W ) has only real non-negative entries, hence
it is self-adjoint.

From ci = p1 − |h ξi, ηi i|2 = p1 − W 2
express Wii = p1 − c2
√I − C2.

ii we can
i and hence diag (W ) =
Since both C and diag(W ) are self-
adjoint matrices, their functions are well deﬁned
by the spectral theorem. Multiplying out the right
hand side of the equation (11) and using the the
obtained expression for diag (W ) we obtain:

dI =W C−1W ∗ + C−1 −(cid:16)C−1pI − C2W ∗

+ W C−1pI − C2(cid:17) .

(14)

Clearly the operators W C−1W ∗ + C−1 and

C−1√I − C2W ∗ + W C−1√I − C2 are self-adjoint.
Let us denote LS(H) the real linear space of self-
adjoint operators on H, endowed with a Hilbert-
scalar product, which we denote as
Schmidt

(·,·)HS . Let us choose an orthonormal basis on
LS composed of the operator dim(H)− 1
2 I and of
operators Xi, such that Tr (Xi) = 0.

From equation (14) we can see that:

W C−1W ∗ + C−1 = β dim(H)− 1
C−1pI − C2W ∗ + W C−1pI − C2 =

2 I + L,

b dim(H)− 1

2 I + L,

(15)

(16)

where L is some real linear combination of Xi,
hence Tr (L) = 0 and β, b ∈ R. It is easy to com-
pute β as follows:

2 I, W C−1W ∗ + C−1)HS

β = (dim(H)− 1
= 2Tr (cid:16)dim(H)− 1
= 2 dim(H)− 1
2 Xi

.

Now it is easy to see, that:

b = 2 dim(H)− 1

2 Xi (cid:0)c−1

i − ci(cid:1) .

because from equation (14) we see that β − b =
2 dim(H)− 1

2 Pi ci as d = 2(dim(H))−1Pi ci.

We have proved the following:

Proposition 6. Let Mi = Pξi and Ni = Pηi for
some orthonormal bases |ξi i and |ηj i. Then (MEI)
condition is equivalent to the equations (15), (16).

The obtained equations look rather complicated,

but they yield some results in speciﬁc cases.

Proposition 7. With the above notations, assume
that ci = c for all i. Then
(i) If c 6= 1 and dim(H) is odd, then (MEI) cannot

be satisﬁed.

(ii) If c 6= 1 and dim(H) is even, then (MEI) is
satisﬁed if and only if W = √1 − c2I + G,
where G is some suitable hollow matrix sat-
isfying G∗ = −G and G2 = −c2I.
(iii) If c = 1, then (MEI) always holds.
Proof. Let’s assume that ci = c 6= 1 for all i. Im-
mediately we see, that C−1 = c−1I and √I − C2 =
√1 − c2I. As a direct consequence of this we ob-

tain L = 0 from the equation (15). Using this to
our advantage in the equation (16) we obtain:

W ∗ + W = 2p1 − c2I.

(17)

9

From here we see, that we can express W in the
form:

W = p1 − c2I + G,

where G is some suitable hollow matrix. We know

that G must be hollow as diag (W ) = √I − C2 =
√1 − c2I. Using this expression in equation (17)

we obtain:

G∗ = −G.

Moreover, since W is unitary, we get:

GG∗ = −G2 = c2I.

(18)

The obtained conditions for G imply that the ma-
trix i
c G is self-adjoint and that it is a square root
of the identity matrix. Therefore the only possible
eigenvalues of i
c G are ±1. But since G is hollow, it
must hold that Tr ( i
c G) = 0 and therefore the mul-
tiplicity of the eigenvalue 1 of the matrix i
c G must
be the same as the multiplicity of the eigenvalue
−1. This can be true only if dim(H) is even.
Now assume that ci = 1, which means that
hξi, ηii = 0 for all i. Again we immediately see
from condition (15) that L = 0. The condition (16)
is trivially satisﬁed. Moreover, the condition (11),
from which we derived the later conditions is triv-
ially satisﬁed as well. Therefore we can conclude
that any two bases, such that the unitary matrix
mapping one base to the other is hollow satisfy the
condition MEI. A special case of such solution is
that the basis |ηji is only a permutation of |ξji,
leaving no element ﬁxed.

A particular case of the situation described above
is when the bases are mutually unbiased, that is
when |h ξi, ηj i| = dim(H)−1/2 for all i, j. Then
H = pdim(H)W is a Hadamard matrix, see e.g.
[14] for more information on complex Hadamard
matrices. As we have seen, such bases can sat-
isfy the condition MEI only in even-dimensional
Hilbert spaces. Below, we provide a further result
for dim(H) = 4. Recall that two Hadamard ma-
trices are equivalent if one can be turned into the
other by multiplication by diagonal unitaries and
permutations. Up to equivalence, any Hadamard
matrix can be turned into a dephased form, with
all elements in the ﬁrst row and column equal to
unity. In this way, all four-dimensional Hadamard
matrices form a one-parameter family, containing

a unique matrix with real entries. The next re-
sult shows that this is the only case when (MEI) is
satisied.

Proposition 8. Let dim(H) = 4, and let the bases
|ξj i and |ηj i be mutually unbiased. Then the con-
dition (MEI) is satisﬁed if and only if the corre-
sponding Hadamard matrix 2W is equivalent to

HR =

1 −1

.

Proof. We need to search for 4 × 4 skew-hermitian
matrices that satisfy the condition (18). Also it is
straightforward to see that in this case c2 = 3/4.
It is good to note that the most general skew-
hermitian matrix G is of the form G = LD − L∗D,
where LD is strictly lower-diagonal matrix and
G2 = L2
D −LDL∗D−L∗DLD. After tedious and
lengthy calculation it can be seen that the strictly
lower diagonal matrix L is of the form:

D +L∗2

LD =

where a, b, c,∈ C, |a| = |b| = |c| = 1. From this, we
obtain

Turning this into the dephased form as in [14], we
obtain the matrix HR.

5 Examples

In this section, we present examples based on the
results of the previous sections.

identity channel φid and amplitude damping chan-
nel φAD. The amplitude damping channels are not
unital and hence (MEI) is not necessarily satisﬁed,
and we will see that the maximally entangled state
is indeed not optimal. The identity channel may be
replaced by a unitary channel with some changes to
the following calculations. We will set λ = 1
2 .
Example 1. Let H denote complex Hilbert space
with dim(H) = 2 and |0 i,|1 i will denote some
orthonormal basis of H. The amplitude damping
channel is represented by Kraus operators Aθ, Bθ,
deﬁned as

Aθ = |0 ih 0| + √1 − θ|1 ih 1|,
Bθ = √θ|0 ih 1|,

where θ ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter. Note that for θ = 0
the amplitude damping channel becomes the iden-
tity. We will proceed as follows: we will ﬁnd the
Choi matrices corresponding to φid and φAD to ob-
tain pMEI and the upper bound. Then we will ﬁnd
popt to compare it with our estimates.

Let Cid = C(φid) and CAD = C(φAD). We will

where X ∈ B(H ⊗ H), ρ0, ρ1 ∈ S(H). We used
MATLAB and the package CVX for solving the
convex program, [6, 7]. We have computed the
numerical values for 100 values of the parameter
θ, homogeneously distributed on the interval [0, 1].
Between these points straights lines were drawn,
hence the ﬁgure looks like a continuous line.

The resulting expressions of pMEI, kTrKZk and
numerical data of popt as functions of θ are plotted
in the Fig. 1. Even though it shows that maximally
entangled input state is not optimal, notice that
the error estimate is tight for small values of the
parameter θ.

5.2 Unitary channels
Example 2. Let λ = 1/2 and dim(H) = 3. Without
loss of generality, we may always assume that we
discriminate the identity channel against a unitary
AdW . As our ﬁrst example, we consider the unitary
matrix

At this point,
it is easy to compute pMEI and
kTrKZk, as we can express them as functions W1,
which is only dependent on ξ, so the bounds are
functions of ξ. Moreover it is possible to compute
popt by numerical methods described in the Exam-
ple 1. The expressions for pMEI and kTrKZk are
long and messy, they are plotted in the Fig. 2 as
well as the computed values of popt. From the ﬁgure
it is once again clear that on one hand as pMEI rises
the the upper bound becomes meaningless, but on
the other hand if pMEI is small then the error esti-
mate and popt is small as well.

Another case we consider is matrix of the form

W2 = 


it is straightforward to obtain pMEI and

tained functions are plotted in Fig. 3. Again it

can be nicely seen that as pMEI rises towards 1 the
estimate becomes meaningless.

5.3 Simple projective measurements

Let us demonstrate our results once more, this time
for simple projective measurements.
Example 3. Let λ = 1
|η1 i =
(|ξ1 i +|ξ2 i), |η2 i = 1√2
1√2
(|ξ1 i−|ξ2 i), |ηj i = |ξj i
for j ≥ 3. According to our previous results maxi-
mally entangled input state is not optimal for dis-
criminating these two measurements. As ﬁrst we
need to ﬁnd TrK|∆ 1

2 , dim(H) ≥ 3,

2| = 1

2 Pi |Pξi − Pηi|. We get
1
2|Pξ1 − Pξ2 − |ξ1 ih ξ2| − |ξ2 ih ξ1||,
1
2|Pξ2 − Pξ1 + |ξ1 ih ξ2| + |ξ2 ih ξ1||,

|Pξ1 − Pη1| =
|Pξ2 − Pη2| =

from which we see, that |Pξ1 − Pη1| = |Pξ2 − Pη2|.
The operator Pξ2 − Pη2 is diagonal in the orthonor-
mal basis |ϕi i, i = 1, . . . , dim(H), where

√2)|ξ2 i(cid:17) ,

|ϕ1 i =

|ϕ2 i =
|ϕj i = |ξj i,

i.e. the bound is meaningful and the same for all
dim(H), even though pMEI tends to 1
2 from above
in the formal limit dim(H) → ∞.
To underline the correctness of our estimates we
will ﬁnd the optimal state for discrimination of the
channels. Let us denote Φξ, Φη the channel corre-
sponding to simple projective measurement corre-
sponding to the set of projectors {Pξi}, {Pηi} re-
spectively and denote P2 = Pξ1 + Pξ2 . Notice that
the channels Φξ and Φη can be separated as follows

on H and φξ

φξ(P ⊥2 ρP ⊥2 ) = 0,
φη(P ⊥2 ρP ⊥2 ) = 0,
χ(P2ρP2) = 0,

where P ⊥2 = I − P2. This leads to the following

Φξ(ρ) = Φξ(P2ρP2 + P ⊥2 ρP ⊥2 ),
Φη(ρ) = Φη(P2ρP2 + P ⊥2 ρP ⊥2 ).

In other words, it is suﬃcient to consider only in-
put states of the form ρ = λ′ρ2 + (1 − λ′)ρ⊥,

12

where ρ2 and ρ⊥ are states, such that P2ρ2P2 = ρ2,
P ⊥2 ρ2P ⊥2 0 = 0, P2ρ⊥P2 = 0, P ⊥2 ρ⊥P ⊥2 = ρ⊥ and
0 ≤ λ′ ≤ 1. Since

be maximal we also have to set λ = 1 and according
to corollary 2 the problem reduces to discriminat-
ing the channels φξ and φη. Both φξ and φη are
unital qubit channels and by our previous results
the optimal input state ρopt is

ρopt =

Appendix

Let |φi,|ψ i be unit vectors, denote Pφ = |φih φ|
the projection onto the subspace generated by |φi.
Let λ ∈ (0, 1) and

Dλ := λPψ − (1 − λ)Pφ,

then

|Dλ| = |µ1|Pξ1 + |µ2|Pξ2 ,

where µ1, µ2 ∈ R are the eigenvalues and ξ1, ξ2 the
corresponding eigenvectors of Dλ. Moreover, we
have

ξi = αiφ + βiψ,

i = 1, 2

and since we do not worry about a phase, we may
suppose that αi ≥ 0. From Dλ|ξi i = µi|ξi i, we
obtain

λ(αi ¯z + βi)|ψ i − (1 − λ)(αi + βiz)|φi =
µiαi|φi + µiβi|ψ i,

where z = h φ, ψ i.

It follows that λ(αi ¯z + βi) =

i = 1, 2

βi = ki ¯z,
where ki = λ
µi−λ αi ∈ R. Moreover from −(1 −
λ)(αi + zβi) = µiαi, after using the expression for
βi we obtain

µi = λ +

where the choice of plus or minus is not clear at
this moment, but from the orthogonality relation
h ξ1, ξ2 i = 0 we see that µ1 6= µ2 therefore the
choices of plus or minus must be diﬀerent for diﬀer-
ent eigenvalues. Note that the same may be seen
by setting z = 0, as in that case we know that
the eigenvalues are λ and λ − 1, hence the choices
are diﬀerent. Finally from the normalization con-
ditions kξik = 1 we obtain
