consisting of edges of label m containing exactly one white vertex.
We shall show that there does not exist any loop in a minimal chart
with exactly seven white vertices in this paper.

Introduction

Charts are oriented labeled graphs in a disk which represent surface braids
(see [1],[5], and see Section 2 for the precise deﬁnition of charts, see [5,
Chapter 14] for the deﬁnition of surface braids). In a chart there are three
kinds of vertices; white vertices, crossings and black vertices. A C-move is
a local modiﬁcation of charts in a disk. The closures of surface braids are
embedded closed oriented surfaces in 4-space R4 (see [5, Chapter 23] for the
deﬁnition of the closures of surface braids). A C-move between two charts
induces an ambient isotopy between the closures of the corresponding two
surface braids.

We will work in the PL category or smooth category. All submanifolds are
assumed to be locally ﬂat. In [11], we showed that there is no minimal chart
with exactly ﬁve vertices (see Section 2 for the precise deﬁnition of minimal
charts). Hasegawa proved that there exists a minimal chart with exactly six
white vertices [2]. This chart represents the surface braid whose closure is
ambient isotopic to a 2-twist spun trefoil. In [3] and [10], we investigated
minimal charts with exactly four white vertices.

A loop of label m in a chart is a simple closed curve consisting of edges

of label m which contains exactly one white vertex.

In this paper, we investigate properties of minimal charts and need to
prove that there is no minimal chart with exactly seven white vertices. In
particular we investigate a minimal chart containing a loop which bounds a
disk containing three white vertices in its interior (see Lemma 3.2). We shall
show the following theorem:

Theorem 1.1 There does not exist any loop in a minimal chart with exactly
seven white vertices.

The paper is organized as follows.

Let Γ be a chart. If an object consists of some edges of Γ, arcs in edges
of Γ and arcs around white vertices, then the object is called a pseudo chart.
In Section 2, we deﬁne charts and
minimal charts. In Section 3, we give pseudo charts in a disk bounded by a
loop in a minimal chart (Lemma 3.1 and Lemma 3.2). And we review a k-
angled disk, a disk whose boundary consists of edges of label m and contains
exactly k white vertices. In Section 4, we give useful lemmata and introduce
notations.
In Section 6, we
discuss about a solar eclipse, two loops with exactly one white vertex. In
Section 7, we discuss about two kinds of subgraphs containing two loops of
label m, one called a pair of eyeglasses and the other called a pair of skew
eyeglasses. In Section 8, we prove Triangle Lemma(Lemma 8.3) for a 3-angled
disk. In Section 9, we prove Theorem 1.1.

In Section 5, we give a proof of Lemma 3.2.

2 Preliminaries

Let n be a positive integer. An n-chart is an oriented labeled graph in
a disk, which may be empty or have closed edges without vertices, called
hoops, satisfying the following four conditions:

(i) Every vertex has degree 1, 4, or 6.

(ii) The labels of edges are in {1, 2, . . . , n − 1}.

(iii) In a small neighborhood of each vertex of degree 6, there are six short
arcs, three consecutive arcs are oriented inward and the other three are
outward, and these six are labeled i and i + 1 alternately for some i,
where the orientation and the label of each arc are inherited from the
edge containing the arc.

(iv) For each vertex of degree 4, diagonal edges have the same label and
are oriented coherently, and the labels i and j of the diagonals satisfy
|i − j| > 1.

We call a vertex of degree 1 a black vertex, a vertex of degree 4 a crossing,
and a vertex of degree 6 a white vertex respectively (see Fig. 1). Among
six short arcs in a small neighborhood of a white vertex, a central arc of
each three consecutive arcs oriented inward or outward is called a middle arc
at the white vertex (see Fig. 1(c)). There are two middle arcs in a small
neighborhood of each white vertex.

Now C-moves are local modiﬁcations of charts in a disk as shown in Fig. 2
(see [1], [5], [12] for the precise deﬁnition). These C-moves as shown in Fig. 2
are examples of C-moves.

Let Γ be a chart. For each label m, we denote by Γm the ’subgraph’ of Γ
consisting of all the edges of label m and their vertices. An edge of Γ is the
closure of a connected component of the set obtained by taking out all white
vertices and crossings from Γ. On the other hand, we assume that

2

Figure 1: (a) A black vertex. (b) A crossing. (c) A white vertex.

Figure 2: For the C-III move, the edge containing the black vertex does not
contain a middle arc in the left ﬁgure.

an edge of Γm is the closure of a connected component of the set ob-
tained by taking out all white vertices from Γm.

Thus any vertex of Γm is a black vertex or a white vertex. Hence any crossing
of Γ is not considered as a vertex of Γm.

Let Γ be a chart, m a label of Γ, and e an edge of Γ or Γm. The edge e is
called a free edge if it has two black vertices. The edge e is called a terminal
edge if it has a white vertex and a black vertex. The edge e is a loop if it
is a closed edge with only one white vertex. Note that free edges, terminal
edges, and loops may contain crossings of Γ.

Two charts are said to be C-move equivalent if there exists a ﬁnite se-

quence of C-moves which modiﬁes one of the two charts to the other.

For each chart Γ, let w(Γ) and f (Γ) be the number of white vertices, and
the number of free edges respectively. The pair (w(Γ), −f (Γ)) is called a
complexity of the chart (see [4]). A chart Γ is called a minimal chart if its

3

complexity is minimal among the charts C-move equivalent to the chart Γ
with respect to the lexicographic order of pairs of integers.

We showed the diﬀerence of a chart in a disk and in a 2-sphere (see [6,
Lemma 2.1]). This lemma follows from that there exists a natural one-to-
one correspondence between {charts in S2}/C-moves and {charts in D2}/C-
moves, conjugations ([5, Chapter 23 and Chapter 25]). To make the argument
simple, we assume that the charts lie on the 2-sphere instead of the disk.

Assumption 1 In this paper, all charts are contained in the 2-sphere S2.

We have the special point in the 2-sphere S2, called the point at inﬁnity,
denoted by ∞. In this paper, all charts are contained in a disk such that the
disk does not contain the point at inﬁnity ∞.

Let Γ be a chart, and m a label of Γ. A hoop is a closed edge of Γ without
vertices (hence without crossings, neither). A ring is a closed edge of Γm
containing a crossing but not containing any white vertices. A hoop is said
to be simple if one of the two complementary domains of the hoop does not
contain any white vertices.

We can assume that all minimal charts Γ satisfy the following ﬁve condi-

tions (see [6],[7],[8]):

Assumption 2 No terminal edge of Γm contains a crossing. Hence any
terminal edge of Γm contains a middle arc.

Assumption 3 No free edge of Γm contains a crossing. Hence any free edge
of Γm is a free edge of Γ.

Assumption 4 All free edges and simple hoops in Γ are moved into a small
neighborhood U∞ of the point at inﬁnity ∞. Hence we assume that Γ does
not contain free edges nor simple hoops, otherwise mentioned.

Assumption 5 Each complementary domain of any ring and hoop must
contain at least one white vertex.

Assumption 6 The point at inﬁnity ∞ is moved in any complementary
domain of Γ.

In this paper for a set X in a space we denote the interior of X, the

boundary of X and the closure of X by IntX, ∂X and Cl(X) respectively.

k-angled disks

Let ℓ be a loop of label m in a chart Γ. Let e be the edge of Γm containing
the white vertex in ℓ with e 6= ℓ. Then the loop ℓ bounds two disks on the
2-sphere. One of the two disks does not contain the edge e. The disk is called
the associated disk of the loop ℓ (see Fig. 3).

4

Figure 3: The gray region is the associated disk of a loop ℓ.

Figure 4: C-moves keeping thicken ﬁgures ﬁxed.

Let Γ be a chart, m a label of Γ, D a disk, and k a positive integer. If ∂D
consists of k edges of Γm, then D is called a k-angled disk of Γm. Note that
the boundary ∂D may contain crossings, and each of two disks bounded by
a loop of label m is a 1-angled disk of Γm.

Let Γ and Γ′ be C-move equivalent charts. Suppose that a pseudo chart
X of Γ is also a pseudo chart of Γ′. Then we say that Γ is modiﬁed to Γ′ by
C-moves keeping X ﬁxed. In Fig. 4, we give examples of C-moves keeping
pseudo charts ﬁxed.

Let Γ be a chart, and m a label of Γ. Let D be a k-angled disk of Γm,
and G a pseudo chart in D with ∂D ⊂ G. Let r : D → D be a reﬂection of
D, and G∗ the pseudo chart obtained from G by changing the orientations
of all of the edges. Then the set {G, G∗, r(G), r(G∗)} is called the RO-family
of the pseudo chart G.

Warning. To draw a pseudo chart in a RO-family, we draw a part of
Γ ∩ N here N is a regular neighborhood of a k-angled disk D. For example,
we draw the pseudo chart in Fig. 5(a) for a pseudo chart in a RO-family in
Fig. 5(b).

Let X be a set in a chart Γ. Let

w(X) = the number of white vertices in X,

c(X) = the number of crossings in X.

Lemma 3.1 ([7, Lemma 4.2 and Lemma 8.1]) Let Γ be a minimal chart
with a loop ℓ∗ of label m with the associated disk D∗. Let ε be the integer
in {+1, −1} such that the white vertex in ℓ∗ is in Γm+ε. Then we have the
following:

(1) w(Γ∩IntD∗) ≥ 2 and w(Γ ∩ (S2 − D∗)) ≥ 2.

5

Figure 5: The gray region is a disk D∗, the thick lines are edges of label m,
and ε ∈ {+1, −1}

(2) If w(Γ∩IntD∗) = 2, then D∗ contains a pseudo chart of the RO-family
of the pseudo chart as shown in Fig. 5(a) by C-moves in D∗ keeping
∂D∗ ﬁxed.

Let Γ be a minimal chart, and m a label of Γ. Let D be a k-angled
disk of Γm. The pair of integers (w(Γ∩IntD), c(Γ ∩ ∂D)) is called the local
complexity with respect to D. Let S be the set of all minimal charts obtained
from Γ by C-moves in a regular neighborhood of D keeping ∂D ﬁxed. The
chart Γ is said to be locally minimal with respect to D if its local complexity
with respect to D is minimal among the charts in S with respect to the
lexicographic order of pairs of integers.

The following lemma will be proved in Section 5.

Lemma 3.2 Let Γ be a minimal chart with a loop ℓ of label k. Let µ be the
integer in {+1, −1} such that the white vertex in ℓ is in Γk+µ. If Γ is locally
minimal with respect to the associated disk D of ℓ and if w(Γ∩IntD) ≤ 3,
then D contains a pseudo chart of the RO-families of the ﬁve pseudo charts
as shown in Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 6.

Let Γ be a chart, and m a label of Γ. An edge of Γm is called a feeler of
a k-angled disk D of Γm if the edge intersects N − ∂D where N is a regular
neighborhood of ∂D in D.

The following lemma will be used in the proofs of Theorem 1.1 and

Lemma 3.2.

Lemma 3.3 ([8, Theorem 1.1]) Let Γ be a minimal chart. Let D be a 2-
angled disk of Γm with at most one feeler such that Γ is locally minimal with
If w(Γ∩IntD) ≤ 1, then D contains a pseudo chart of the

RO-families of the ﬁve pseudo charts as shown in Fig. 7.

Let Γ be a chart, and D a k-angled disk of Γm. If any feeler of D is a

terminal edge, then we say that D is special.

The following lemma will be used in Case (e) and Case (f) of the proof

of Lemma 3.2.

Figure 6: The thick lines are edges of label k + µ where µ ∈ {+1, −1}.

Lemma 3.4 ([8, Theorem 1.2]) Let Γ be a minimal chart. Let D be a special
3-angled disk of Γm such that Γ is locally minimal with respect to D.
If
w(Γ∩IntD) = 0, then D contains a pseudo chart of the RO-families of the
two pseudo charts as shown in Fig. 8.

4 Useful lemmata

Let Γ be a chart. Let D be a disk such that

(1) ∂D consists of an edge e1 of Γm and an edge e2 of Γm+1, and

(2) any edge containing a white vertex in e1 does not intersect the open

disk IntD.

Note that ∂D may contain crossings. Let w1 and w2 be the white vertices in
e1. If the disk D satisﬁes one of the following conditions, then D is called a
lens of type (m, m + 1) (see Fig. 9):

(i) Neither e1 nor e2 contains a middle arc.

(ii) One of the two edges e1 and e2 contains middle arcs at both white

vertices w1 and w2 simultaneously.

The following lemma will be used in Case (a), Case (d) and Case (e) of

the proof of Lemma 3.2.

with one feeler. The thick lines are edges of label m, and ε, δ ∈ {+1, −1}.

Figure 8: The thick lines are edges of label m, and ε ∈ {+1, −1}.

Lemma 4.1 ([6, Theorem 1.1]) Let Γ be a minimal chart. Then there exist
at least three white vertices in the interior of any lens.

Lemma 4.2 ([7, Lemma 6.1]) Let Γ be a minimal chart.
If a connected
component G of Γm contains a white vertex, then G contains at least two
white vertices.

Let α be an arc, and p, q points in α. We denote by α[p, q] the subarc of

α whose end points are p and q.

Let Γ be a chart, and m a label of Γ. Let α be an arc in an edge of Γm,
and w a white vertex with w 6∈ α. Suppose that there exists an arc β in Γ
such that its end points are the white vertex w and an interior point p of the
arc α. Then we say that the white vertex w connects with the point p of α by
the arc β.

The following lemma will be used in Case (c) of the proof of Lemma 3.2.

Lemma 4.3 ([6, Lemma 4.2]) (Shifting Lemma) Let Γ be a chart and α an
arc in an edge of Γm. Let w be a white vertex of Γk ∩ Γh where h = k + ε, ε ∈
{+1, −1}. Suppose that the white vertex w connects with a point p of the
arc α by an arc in an edge e of Γk. Suppose that one of the following two
conditions is satisﬁed:

8

Figure 9:

Figure 10: Case (1): k > m and ε = +1.

(1) h > k > m.

(2) h < k < m.

Then for any neighborhood V of the arc e[w, p] we can shift the white vertex
w to e − e[w, p] along the edge e by C-I-R2 moves, C-I-R3 moves and C-I-R4
moves in V keeping [

Γk+iε ﬁxed (see Fig. 10).

i<0

The following lemma will be used in Case (d) in the proof of Lemma 3.2

and Step 3, Step 6 and Step 8 in the proof of Theorem 1.1.

Lemma 4.4 ([6, Lemma 5.4]) If a minimal chart Γ contains the pseudo
chart as shown in Fig. 11, then the interior of the disk D∗ contains at least
one white vertex, where D∗ is the disk with the boundary e∗

3 ∪ e∗

4 ∪ e∗.

We use the following notation:
In our argument, we often need a name for an unnamed edge by using
a given edge and a given white vertex. For the convenience, we use the
following naming: Let e′, ei, e′′ be three consecutive edges containing a white
vertex wj. Here, the two edges e′ and e′′ are unnamed edges. There are six
arcs in a neighborhood U of the white vertex wj. If the three arcs e′ ∩ U,
ei ∩ U, e′′ ∩ U lie anticlockwisely around the white vertex wj in this order,
then e′ and e′′ are denoted by aij and bij respectively (see Fig. 12). There is
a possibility aij = bij if they are contained in a loop.

Let Γ be a chart, and v a vertex. Let α be a short arc of Γ in a small
neighborhood of v with v ∈ ∂α. If the arc α is oriented to v, then α is called
an inward arc, and otherwise α is called an outward arc.

Figure 11: The gray region is the disk D∗. The label of the edge e∗ is m, and
ε ∈ {+1, −1}.

Figure 12:

Let Γ be an n-chart. Let F be a closed domain with ∂F ⊂ Γk−1∪Γk ∪Γk+1
for some label k of Γ, where Γ0 = ∅ and Γn = ∅. By Condition (iii) for charts,
in a small neighborhood of each white vertex, there are three inward arcs and
three outward arcs. Also in a small neighborhood of each black vertex, there
exists only one inward arc or one outward arc. We often use the following
fact, when we ﬁx (inward or outward) arcs near white vertices and black
vertices:

The number of inward arcs contained in F ∩ Γk is equal to the number
of outward arcs in F ∩ Γk.

When we use this fact, we say that we use IO-Calculation with respect to Γk
in F . For example, in a minimal chart Γ, consider the pseudo chart as shown
in Fig. 13 where µ ∈ {+1, −1} and

(1) D is the associated disk of a loop ℓ of label k with w(Γ∩IntD) = 3,

(2) w2, w3, w4 are white vertices in IntD with w2, w3, w4 ∈ Γk+µ,

(3) none of the four edges a33, b33, a44, b44 contains a middle arc at w3 nor

w4 (by Assumption 2 none of them is a terminal edge).

By (2), we have wi ∈ Γk or wi ∈ Γk+2µ for each i = 2, 3, 4. Let F =
Cl(D − D1). Then we can show that

if w2 ∈ Γk+2µ, then w3, w4 ∈ Γk or w3, w4 ∈ Γk+2µ.

10

Figure 13: The thick lines are edges of label k + µ where µ ∈ {+1, −1}. The
gray region is a 2-angled disk D1.

Figure 14:

For if not, then one of w3, w4 is in Γk and the other is in Γk+2µ. If w3 ∈ Γk
and w4 ∈ Γk+2µ, then considering ∂D = ℓ contains one inward arc and one
outward arc, by (3) the number of inward arcs in F ∩ Γk is one, but the
number of outward arcs in F ∩ Γk is three. This is a contradiction. Similarly
if w3 ∈ Γk+2µ and w4 ∈ Γk, then we have the same contradiction. Thus
if w2 ∈ Γk+2µ, then w3, w4 ∈ Γk or w3, w4 ∈ Γk+2µ.
Instead of the above
argument, we just say that

if w2 ∈ Γk+2µ, then we have w3, w4 ∈ Γk or w3, w4 ∈ Γk+2µ by IO-
Calculation with respect to Γk in F .

In our argument we often construct a chart Γ. On the construction of a
chart Γ, for a white vertex w, among the three edges of Γm containing w, if
one of the three edges is a terminal edge (see Fig. 14(a) and (b)), then we
remove the terminal edge and put a black dot at the center of the white vertex
as shown in Fig. 14(c). Namely Fig. 14(c) means Fig. 14(a) or Fig. 14(b).

5 Proof of Lemma 3.2

We start to prove Lemma 3.2. Let Γ be a minimal chart with a loop ℓ of
label k such that Γ is locally minimal with respect to the associated disk D
of ℓ. Suppose w(Γ∩IntD) ≤ 3. By Lemma 3.1, we only need to examine the
case w(Γ∩IntD) = 3. In this section we assume that

(1) w1 is the white vertex in the loop ℓ of label k, and

(2) µ is the integer in {+1, −1} with w1 ∈ Γk+µ.

11

Figure 15: The thick lines are edges of label k + µ where µ ∈ {+1, −1}.

By Lemma 3.1(1), the condition w(Γ∩IntD) = 3 implies that the disk D
contains at most one loop of label k + µ. Thus we can easily prove that the
disk D contains a pseudo chart of the RO-families of the six pseudo charts
as shown in Fig. 15. We use the notations as shown in Fig. 15 throughout
this section. There are six cases (see Fig. 15).

Case (a). Suppose that the disk D contains the pseudo chart as shown

in Fig. 15(a), where

(a-1) the loop ℓ1 is of label k + µ, and bounds a disk D1.

Since w(Γ∩IntD) = 3, by Lemma 3.1(1) the disk D1 contains exactly two
white vertices in its interior, say w3, w4. Further by Lemma 3.1(2) the disk
D1 contains a pseudo chart of the RO-family of the pseudo chart as shown
in Fig. 5(a). Comparing Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 15(a), we have D∗ = D1, m =
k + µ, w = w2 and

We claim that all of e∗
If not, then there ex-
ists a lens in D not containing any white vertices in its interior, because
e∗
3 6= e∗
5. This contradicts Lemma 4.1. Hence all of the four
edges must intersect ∂D. Thus 2 ≤ |(k + µ + 2ε) − k| = |µ + 2ε|. Hence
ε = µ because ε, δ ∈ {+1, −1}. Thus by (a-2), we have e∗
2 ⊂ Γk+2µ,
and e∗
6 ⊂ Γk+3µ. Therefore we have the pseudo chart as shown in

Case (b). Suppose that the disk D contains the pseudo chart as shown

in Fig. 15(b), where

(b-1) D1 is a 2-angled disk of Γk+µ with one feeler.

Since w(Γ∩IntD) = 3, we have w(Γ∩IntD1) ≤ 1. Thus by Lemma 3.3, the
disk D1 contains a pseudo chart of the RO-family of the pseudo chart as
shown in Fig. 7(c) because the only pseudo chart contains a feeler. Compar-
ing Fig. 7(c) and Fig. 15(b), we have m = k + µ, w = w2 and

(b-2) e∗

2 ⊂ Γk+µ+ε where ε ∈ {+1, −1},

(b-3) e∗

6, e∗

7 ⊂ Γk+µ+δ where δ ∈ {+1, −1}.

We shall show µ = ε = δ. If ε = −µ, then we have e∗
2 ⊂ Cl(D − D1). Hence whether e∗

2 ⊂ Γk. Thus
e∗
1, e∗
7 ⊂ Γk or not, we have a contradiction
by IO-Calculation with respect to Γk in Cl(D − D1). Thus ε = µ. If δ = −µ,
then we have e∗
2 ⊂ Γk+2µ and since
e∗
7 ⊂ Γk, we have a contradiction by IO-Calculation with respect to Γk−µ in
D. Thus we have δ = µ. Hence by (b-2) and (b-3), we have

4 ⊂ Γk−µ. Thus e∗

4 ⊂ D. Since e∗

3, e∗

4 ⊂ Γk+3µ, and e∗

6, e∗

7 ⊂ Γk+2µ.

Therefore we have the pseudo chart as shown in Fig. 6(b).

Case (c). Suppose that the disk D contains the pseudo chart as shown

in Fig. 15(c) where

(c-1) D1 is a 2-angled disk of Γk+µ without feelers,

(c-2) the edges in ∂D1 are oriented from w2 to w3, and

(c-3) each of edges a22, b22, a33, b33 is of label k or k + 2µ.

Let w4 be the white vertex in IntD diﬀerent from w2 and w3. We show
that we can push w4 out D by C-moves. Since w(Γ∩IntD) = 3, we have
w(Γ∩IntD1) ≤ 1. Thus considering the orientations of edges in ∂D1, by
(c-1), (c-2) and Lemma 3.3, the disk D1 contains a pseudo chart of the
RO-families of the two pseudo charts as shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b). Hence
w4 ∈ D − D1. Let s be the label with w4 ∈ Γs ∩ Γs+1. There are three cases:

(i) for each j = s, s + 1 none of edges of Γj containing w4 intersects ∂D,

(ii) for each j = s, s + 1 there exists an edge of Γj containing w4 and

intersecting ∂D,

(iii) otherwise.

13

Case (i). By Lemma 4.2, for each j = s, s + 1 the connected component
of Γj containing w4 contains another white vertex w2 or w3. Hence there
exists an edge e′
s and
e′
s+1 is a22 or b22 and the other is a33 or b33. Thus by (c-3), the diﬀerence of
labels of e′
s is of label
s and e′

s+1 is 0 or ±2. This is a contradiction, because e′

s+1 is of lable s + 1. Hence Case (i) does not occur.

j of Γj with e′

j ∋ w4 containing w2 or w3. Here one of e′

s and e′

Case (ii). We have |s − k| ≥ 2 and |(s + 1) − k| ≥ 2, because ℓ = ∂D
is of label k. Hence we can show s < s + 1 < k or k < s < s + 1. By
Shifting Lemma(Lemma 4.3) we can push the white vertex w4 from IntD to
the exterior of D by C-moves. However this contradicts the fact that Γ is
locally minimal with respect to D. Hence Case (ii) does not occur.

Case (iii). Let e be the edge Γs or Γs+1 with e ∋ w4 and e ∩ ∂D 6= ∅,
and t the label of e. Then t ∈ {s, s + 1}. Let j ∈ {s, s + 1} be the label
diﬀerent from t. Then t = j + δ for some δ ∈ {+1, −1} and none of edges
of Γj containing w4 intersects ∂D. In a similar way to Case (i), we can show
that there exists an edge e′
j ∋ w4 containing w2 or w3. Here e′
j
is a22, b22, a33 or b33. By (c-3), we have j = k or j = k + 2µ. Thus we have
t = k + δ or t = k + 2µ + δ. Since the edge e of label t intersects the loop
ℓ = ∂D of label k, we have |t − k| ≥ 2. Hence µ = δ and t = k + 3µ. Thus

j of Γj with e′

(c-4) w4 ∈ Γk+2µ ∩ Γk+3µ.

There exists an arc β in a regular neighborhood of e′
j ∪ D1 ∪ e2 ∪ e3 in D
connecting the vertex w4 and a point x in ∂D such that Intβ intersects Γ
transversely and

(c-5) β ∩ Γk+µ = ∅.

Let p be a point in Intβ with Γ ∩ β[w4, p] = w4. By C-I-R2 moves, in a reg-
ular neighborhood N of β[p, x] we can push all the arcs of N ∩ (∪i≥2Γk+iµ)
from D along β so that (β − w4) ∩ Γk+iµ = ∅ (i ≥ 2), and by (c-4) and (c-5)
we can push the white vertex w4 along β from IntD to the exterior of D by
C-I-R2 moves and C-I-R4 moves (cf. [6, Corollary 4.5]). However again this
contradicts the fact Γ is locally minimal with respect to D. Hence the disk
D does not contain the pseudo chart as shown in Fig. 15(c).

Case (d). Suppose that the disk D contains the pseudo chart as shown
in Fig. 15(d). Since w(Γ∩IntD1) = 0, considering the orientation of edges
on ∂D1, Lemma 3.3 assures that the disk D1 contains a pseudo chart of
the RO-families of the two pseudo charts as shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b). So
we have the pseudo chart as shown in Fig. 13 used for the explanation of
IO-Calculation, here

(d-1) none of edges a22, b22, a33, b33, a44, b44 contains a middle arc at w2, w3

nor w4 (by Assumption 2 none of them is a terminal edge).

Since w2 ∈ Γk+µ, we have also w2 ∈ Γk or w2 ∈ Γk+2µ.

If w2 ∈ Γk,
then w4 ∈ Γk by IO-Calculation with respect to Γk in Cl(D − D1). Hence

14

1 = e4, e∗

3 = e1, e∗

w3 ∈ Γk+2µ by IO-Calculation with respect to Γk in Cl(D − D1). Thus by
(d-1), we have a22 = b44 and b22 = a44. Since w2, w3, w4 are all the white
vertices in IntD, the disk D2 bounded by a22 ∪ e1 ∪ e3 does not contain
any white vertices in its interior. This contradicts Lemma 4.4 by setting
D∗ = D2, e∗
4 = e3 in Fig. 11. Hence
w2 ∈ Γk+2µ. Thus as we have done in the explanation of IO-Calculation, we
have w3, w4 ∈ Γk or w3, w4 ∈ Γk+2µ by IO-Calculation with respect to Γk in
Cl(D − D1). If w3, w4 ∈ Γk, then there exist two lenses of type (k, k + µ)
in D not containing any white vertices in their interiors. This contradicts
Lemma 4.1. Thus w3, w4 ∈ Γk+2µ. Looking at Fig. 13, we have the pseudo
chart as shown in Fig. 6(c).

2 = e2, e∗ = a22, e∗

Case (e). Suppose that the disk D contains the pseudo chart as shown

in Fig. 15(e) where

(e-1) w3, w4 are contained in terminal edges of label k + µ, say e3, e4,

(e-2) the edge e2 does not contain a middle arc at w2 (hence e2 is not a

terminal edge by Assumption 2),

(e-3) the edge e2 contains an outward arc at w2.

By (e-1), any feeler of D1 is a terminal edge. Thus the disk D1 is a special
3-angled disk of Γk+µ. Hence w(Γ∩IntD1) = 0 and Lemma 3.4 imply that
the disk D1 contains a pseudo chart of the RO-families of the two pseudo
charts as shown in Fig. 8 each of which has no feeler. Hence neither e3 nor
e4 is a feeler. That is

(e-4) e3 ∪ e4 ⊂ Cl(D − D1).

Comparing Fig. 8 and Fig. 15(e), we have m = k + µ, and by (e-2) the edge
e2 is an edge of label m + ε with two white vertices where ε ∈ {+1, −1}.
Hence

(e-5) the edge e2 is an edge of Γk+µ+ε with ∂e2 = {w2, w3} or ∂e2 = {w2, w4}.

If ∂e2 = {w2, w3}, then by (e-3) the edge e2 is oriented from w2 to w3. This
contradicts Condition (iii) of the deﬁnition of a chart. Hence ∂e2 = {w2, w4}
(see Fig. 16). Thus

(e-6) w2, w4 ∈ Γk+µ+ε.

On the other hand, by (e-1), we have

(e-7) w3 ∈ Γk+µ ∩ Γk or w3 ∈ Γk+µ ∩ Γk+2µ.

Suppose µ = −ε. Then w2, w4 ∈ Γk by (e-6).
If w3 ∈ Γk, then we have
a33 = b44 in Fig. 16 because the loop ℓ is of label k. Hence there exists a lens
of type (k, k + µ) in Cl(D − D1) containing w3, w4 but not containing any

15

Figure 16: The thick lines are edges of label k + µ where µ, ε ∈ {+1, −1}.

white vertices in its interior. This contradicts Lemma 4.1. Hence w3 ∈ Γk+2µ
by (e-7). But we have a contradiction by IO-Calculation with respect to Γk
in Cl(D − D1). Thus µ = ε.

By (e-6), we have w2, w4 ∈ Γk+2µ. If w3 ∈ Γk, then we have a contradic-
tion by IO-Calculation with respect to Γk in Cl(D − D1). Hence w3 ∈ Γk+2µ
by (e-7). Therefore we have the pseudo chart as shown in Fig. 6(d).

Case (f). Suppose that the disk D contains the pseudo chart as shown
in Fig. 15(f). Since w(Γ∩IntD2) = 0, by Lemma 3.3 the 2-angled disk D2
contains a pseudo chart of the RO-families of the two pseudo charts as shown
in Fig. 7(a) and (b). Hence both the two edges in ∂D2 are oriented from w3
to w4. Thus

(f-1) the boundary of the 3-angled disk D1 is oriented clockwise.

On the other hand, the disk D1 does not have any feelers. Thus the disk
D1 is special. Since w(Γ∩IntD1) = 0, by Lemma 3.4 the disk D1 contains a
pseudo chart of the RO-families of the two pseudo charts as shown in Fig. 8.
This contradicts Condition (f-1). Hence D does not contain the pseudo chart
as shown in Fig. 15(f).

Therefore we complete the proof of Lemma 3.2.

Solar eclipses

Lemma 6.1 ([7, Corollary 1.3]) Let Γ be a minimal chart with at most seven
white vertices. Then there is no lens of Γ.

A subgraph of a chart is called a solar eclipse if it consists of two loops

and contains only one white vertex.

Lemma 6.2 ([7, Lemma 8.4]) Let Γ be a minimal chart with at most seven
white vertices. If there exists a solar eclipse, then the associated disk of each
loop of the solar eclipse contains at least three white vertices in its interior.

16

Lemma 6.3 Let D be the associated disk of a loop ℓ of label m in a minimal
chart Γ with w(Γ) = 7 such that Γ is locally minimal with respect to D. Let
ε be the integer in {+1, −1} such that the white vertex in ℓ is in Γm+ε. Then
we have the following:

(1) If w(Γ∩IntD) = 2, then w(Γm+2ε ∩ (S2 − D)) ≥ 2.

(2) If w(Γ∩IntD) = 3, then w(Γm+2ε ∩ (S2 − D)) ≥ 1.

(3) If w(Γ∩IntD) = 3 and if the disk D contains one of the two pseudo
charts as shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b) here m = k and ε = µ, then
w(Γm+3ε ∩ (S2 − D)) ≥ 1.

Proof. We show Statement (1). By Lemma 3.1(2), the disk D contains a
pseudo chart of the RO-family of the pseudo chart as shown in Fig. 5(a)
here D = D∗. Since none of the four edges e∗
6 of Γm+2ε in Fig. 5(a)
contains a middle arc at a white vertex in IntD, all of four edges e∗
5, e∗
6
are not terminal edges by Assumption 2.
If w(Γm+2ε ∩ (S2 − D)) = 0, then e∗

6. Thus there exist

4 = e∗

3 = e∗

two lenses of type (m + ε, m + 2ε). This contradicts Lemma 6.1.

Now suppose that w(Γm+2ε ∩ (S2 − D)) = 1. Let D1 be the 2-angled disk
of Γm+2ε in D. Since w(Γm+2ε ∩ (S2 − D)) = 1 and w(Γm+2ε ∩ (D − D1)) = 0,
there exists only one white vertex of Γm+2ε in S2 − D1. Thus we have a
contradiction by IO-Calculation with respect to Γm+2ε in Cl(S2 −D1). Hence
w(Γm+2ε ∩ (S2 − D)) ≥ 2.

We show Statement (3). Suppose that the disk D contains the pseudo
chart as shown in Fig. 6(a) here k = m and µ = ε. Then the loop ℓ1 of
label m + ε in D bounds the associated disk D1 with w(Γ∩IntD1) = 2. By
Lemma 6.3(1), we have w(Γ(m+ε)+2ε ∩ (S2 − D1)) ≥ 2. Since w(Γm+3ε ∩ (D −
D1)) = 0, we have w(Γm+3ε ∩ (S2 − D)) ≥ 2. Thus clearly w(Γm+3ε ∩ (S2 −
D)) ≥ 1.

Suppose that the disk D contains the pseudo chart as shown in Fig. 6(b)
here k = m and µ = ε. By Lemma 4.2, the condition w(Γm+3ε ∩ D) = 1
implies w(Γm+3ε ∩ (S2 − D)) ≥ 1.

We show Statement (2). Now suppose that

(i) w(Γm+2ε ∩ (S2 − D)) = 0.

Since w(Γ∩IntD) = 3, by Lemma 3.2 the disk D contains a pseudo chart of
the RO-families of the four pseudo charts as shown in Fig. 6 where k = m
and µ = ε.

Suppose that the disk D contains the pseudo chart as shown in Fig. 6(a).
By (i), we have a loop ℓ2 of label m + 2ε so that ℓ1 ∪ ℓ2 is a solar eclipse.
But the associated disk of ℓ1 contains only two white vertices in its interior.
This contradicts Lemma 6.2.

Suppose that the disk D contains the pseudo chart as shown in Fig. 6(b).
Let D1 be the 2-angled disk of Γm+ε in D. Since w(Γm+2ε ∩ (D − D1)) = 0,

17

the condition (i) implies that w(Γm+2ε ∩ (S2 − D1)) = 0. Hence we have a
contradiction by IO-Calculation with respect to Γm+2ε in Cl(S2 − D1).

Suppose that the disk D contains the pseudo chart as shown in Fig. 6(c).
Let D1 be the 2-angled disk of Γm+ε in D. Since there exists only one white
vertex of Γm+2ε in D − D1, the condition (i) implies that w(Γm+2ε ∩ (S2 −
D1)) = 1. Hence we have a contradiction by IO-Calculation with respect to
Γm+2ε in Cl(S2 − D1).

Suppose the disk D contains the pseudo chart as shown in Fig. 6(d). Let
D1 be the 3-angled disk of Γm+ε in D. Since w(Γm+2ε ∩ (D − D1)) = 0, the
condition (i) implies that w(Γm+2ε ∩ (S2 − D1)) = 0. Hence for the edge e′
1 in
Fig. 6(d) we have e′
2, then there exists a
lens of type (m + ε, m + 2ε) containing w3, w4. This contradicts Lemma 6.1.
1 separates the disk Cl(S2 − D1) into
If e′
two disks. Let D′ be the disk of the two disks containing the edge e′
2. Then
we have a contradiction by IO-Calculation with respect to Γm+2ε in D′.

Therefore we have a contradiction for any cases. Hence w(Γm+2ε ∩ (S2 −

D)) ≥ 1.

Proposition 6.4 There is no solar eclipse in a minimal chart with exactly
seven white vertices.

Proof. Suppose that there exists a solar eclipse G in a minimal chart Γ
with w(Γ) = 7. Then G consists of two loops ℓ1 and ℓ2 with ℓ1 ⊂ Γm and
ℓ2 ⊂ Γm+1 for some label m. We can assume that Γ is locally minimal with
respect to the associated disks D1 and D2 of the loops ℓ1 and ℓ2 respectively.
By Lemma 6.2, we have w(Γ∩IntD1) ≥ 3 and w(Γ∩IntD2) ≥ 3. Since
w(Γ) = 7 and w(ℓ1 ∪ ℓ2) = 1, we have w(Γ∩IntD1) = 3 and w(Γ∩IntD2) = 3.
By Lemma 3.2, the two disks D1 and D2 contain pseudo charts of the RO-
families of the four pseudo charts as shown in Fig. 6. For ℓ2 ⊂ Γm+1 where
ℓ = ℓ2, k = m + 1, µ = −1 in Fig. 6 we have

(1) w((Γm ∪ Γm−1)∩IntD2) = 3.

Since S2 −D1 ⊃IntD2, by (1) we have w((Γm ∪Γm−1)∩(S2 −D1)) ≥ w((Γm ∪
Γm−1)∩IntD2) = 3. Setting ℓ = ℓ1 ⊂ Γm and ε = 1 (because the white vertex
in ℓ1 is in Γm+1), applying Lemma 6.3(2) we have w(Γm+2 ∩ (S2 − D1)) ≥ 1.
Hence we have
w(Γ ∩ (S2 − D1)) ≥ w((Γm ∪ Γm−1) ∩ (S2 − D1)) + w(Γm+2 ∩ (S2 − D1))

Thus

≥ 3 + 1 = 4.

w(Γ) = w(ℓ1) + w(Γ∩IntD1) + w(Γ ∩ (S2 − D1)) ≥ 1 + 3 + 4 = 8.

This contradicts the fact w(Γ) = 7. Therefore there is no solar eclipse in Γ.

Lemma 6.5 Let ℓ be a loop of label m in a minimal chart Γ with w(Γ) = 7,
and D the associated disk of ℓ. Then w(Γm ∩ (S2 − D)) ≤ 2.

Proof. Suppose that w(Γm ∩ (S2 − D)) ≥ 3. We shall show w(Γ) ≥ 8. It
suﬃces to prove the case that Γ is locally minimal with respect to D. Let
ε be the integer in {+1, −1} such that the white vertex in ℓ is in Γm+ε. By
Lemma 3.1(1) we have w(Γ∩IntD) ≥ 2.

If w(Γ∩IntD) = 2, then by Lemma 6.3(1) we have w(Γm+2ε ∩ (S2 − D)) ≥

2. Since w(Γm ∩ (S2 − D)) ≥ 3, we have w(Γ ∩ (S2 − D)) ≥ 3 + 2. Thus

w(Γ) = w(ℓ) + w(Γ∩IntD) + w(Γ ∩ (S2 − D)) ≥ 1 + 2 + (3 + 2) = 8.

If w(Γ∩IntD) = 3, then by Lemma 6.3(2) we have w(Γm+2ε ∩ (S2 − D)) ≥ 1.
Similarly we can show w(Γ) ≥ 1 + 3 + (3 + 1) = 8. If w(Γ∩IntD) ≥ 4, then
we can show w(Γ) ≥ 1 + 4 + (3 + 0) = 8. Hence we have w(Γ) ≥ 8. This
contradicts the fact w(Γ) = 7. Therefore w(Γm ∩ (S2 − D)) ≤ 2.

7 Pairs of eyeglasses and pairs of skew eyeglasses

Lemma 7.1 (cf. [7, Lemma 6.2]) Let Γ be a minimal chart, and m a label
of Γ. Let G be a connected component of Γm containing a white vertex and
a loop. If G contains at most three white vertices, then G is one of the three
subgraphs as shown in Fig. 17.

We call the subgraph as shown in Fig. 17(a) a pair of eyeglasses. We call
the subgraphs as shown in Fig. 17(b) and (c) pairs of skew eyeglasses of type
1 and 2 respectively.

Lemma 7.2 Let G be a pair of eyeglasses in a minimal chart Γ with w(Γ) =
7. Let D1, D2 be the associated disks of loops in G. If Γ is locally minimal with
respect to the disks D1 and D2, then w(Γ∩IntD1) = 2 and w(Γ∩IntD2) = 2.

Proof. Since w(Γ∩IntD1) + w(Γ∩IntD2) + w(G) ≤ w(Γ) = 7, we have
w(Γ∩IntD1) + w(Γ∩IntD2) ≤ 5. Thus by Lemma 3.1(1) we have

(w(Γ∩IntD1), w(Γ∩IntD2)) = (2, 2), (2, 3) or (3, 2).

19

Suppose that (w(Γ∩IntD1), w(Γ∩IntD2)) = (2, 3). Then by w(Γ) = 7,

we have

(1) w(Γ ∩ (S2 − (D1 ∪ D2))) = 0.

Further by Lemma 3.1(2) the disk D1 contains a pseudo chart of the RO-
family of the pseudo chart as shown in Fig. 5(a) (see Fig. 18(a)). Without
loss of generality we can assume that the edge e1 of Γm is oriented from w2
to w1. We use the notations as shown in Fig. 18(a). Hence

(2) w(Γm+ε ∩ D1) = 3.

One of the two edges a11, b11 of Γm+ε in Fig. 18(a) does not contain a
middle arc at w1, one of the two edges is not a terminal edge by Assumption 2.
Thus by (1), there are three cases: a11 = b11, a11 ∋ w2 or b11 ∋ w2. But if
a11 = b11, then a11 ∪ ℓ1 is a solar eclipse. This contradicts Proposition 6.4.
Hence we have

(3) w2 ∈ a11 ⊂ Γm+ε or w2 ∈ b11 ⊂ Γm+ε.

Since w(Γ∩IntD2) = 3, by Lemma 3.2 the disk D2 contains a pseudo
chart of the RO-families of the four pseudo charts as shown in Fig. 6. By
(3), for the label k and µ ∈ {+1, −1} in Fig. 6 we have k = m and µ = ε.

Suppose that D2 contains one of the two pseudo charts as shown in
Fig. 6(a) and (b). Then we have w(Γm+3ε ∩ (S2 − D2)) ≥ 1 by Lemma 6.3(3).
Further S2 − D2 ⊃ D1 and (2) imply that w((Γm+ε ∪ Γm+3ε) ∩ (S2 − D2)) ≥
3 + 1 = 4. Thus we have w(Γ ∩ (S2 − D2)) ≥ 4. Hence

w(Γ) = w(ℓ2) + w(Γ∩IntD2) + w(Γ ∩ (S2 − D2)) ≥ 1 + 3 + 4 = 8.

This contradicts the fact w(Γ) = 7.

Suppose that D2 contains the pseudo chart as shown in Fig. 6(c) (see
Fig. 18(b)). Now let Ei be the 2-angled disk of Γm+ε in Di for i = 1, 2. Since
(D1 ∪ D2) − (E1 ∪ E2) contains only one white vertex of Γm+2ε, the condition
(1) implies w(Γm+2ε ∩ (S2 − (E1 ∪ E2))) = 1. Hence we have a contradiction
by IO-Calculation with respect to Γm+2ε in Cl(S2 − (E1 ∪ E2)).

Suppose that D2 contains the pseudo chart as shown in Fig. 6(d) (see

Fig. 18(c)) where

(d-1) none of e∗

2. Then we have a contradiction
by IO-Calculation with respect to Γm+2ε in D′.
1 is a loop, then the
1 contains w2. Further by (d-2), the disk D∗ must
associated disk D∗ of e∗
contain the three white vertices in D1. Hence S2 − (D3 ∪ D∗) does not
contain any white vertices. Thus e∗

a lens of type (m + ε, m + 2ε). This contradicts Lemma 6.1. Therefore e∗

Thus we have a contradiction for any cases. Hence (w(Γ∩IntD1), w(Γ∩IntD2)) 6=

(2, 3). In a similar way as above, we can show that (w(Γ∩IntD1), w(Γ∩IntD2)) 6=
(3, 2). Therefore (w(Γ∩IntD1), w(Γ∩IntD2)) = (2, 2). This completes the
proof of Lemma 7.2.
(cid:3)

Proposition 7.3 There is no pair of eyeglasses in a minimal chart with
exactly seven white vertices.

Proof. Suppose that there exists a pair of eyeglasses G in a minimal chart Γ
with w(Γ) = 7. Without loss of generality we can assume that Γ is locally
minimal with respect to the associated disks D1 and D2 of loops in G. By
Lemma 7.2, we have (w(Γ∩IntD1), w(Γ∩IntD2)) = (2, 2). By Lemma 3.1(2)
each of the disks D1 and D2 contains a pseudo chart of the RO-family of the
pseudo chart as shown in Fig. 5(a) (see Fig. 18(d)). Moreover there exists
exactly one white vertex in S2 − (D1 ∪ D2), say w′.

21

If w′ ∈ Γm, then this contradicts Lemma 4.2. Thus w′ 6∈ Γm.
If w′ ∈ Γm+2ε, then there exists only one white vertex w′ of Γm+2ε in
S2−(E1∪E2) where Ei is the 2-angled disk Ei in Di for i = 1, 2. Hence if w2 ∈
Γm+ε (resp. w2 6∈ Γm+ε, i.e. w2 ∈ Γm−ε) then we have a contradiction by IO-
Calculation with respect to Γm+2ε in Cl(S2 − (E1 ∪ E2)) (resp. Cl(S2 − E1)).
Thus w′ 6∈ Γm+2ε.

6∈ Γm−2ε. Now w′

Similarly we can show w′

6∈
Γm±ε, because a white vertex in Γk is also in Γk−1 or Γk+1. Hence the vertex
w′ is contained in Γk for some label k with k 6= m, m ± ε, m ± 2ε. However Γk
contains exactly one white vertex w′. This contradicts Lemma 4.2. Therefore
there is no pair of eyeglasses in Γ.
(cid:3)

6∈ Γm ∪ Γm±2ε implies w′

Proposition 7.4 There is no pair of skew eyeglasses of type 2 in a minimal
chart with exactly seven white vertices.

Proof. Suppose that there exists a pair of skew eyeglasses G of type 2 in
a minimal chart Γ with w(Γ) = 7. We only show that the edge e3 of Γm
is oriented inward at w3. We use the notations as shown in Fig. 19(a). By
Lemma 3.1(1), the condition w(Γ) = 7 implies (w(Γ∩IntD1), w(Γ∩IntD2)) =
(2, 2). Thus

(i) w(Γ ∩ (S2 − (G ∪ D1 ∪ D2))) = 0.

For the edge a33 of Γm+ε in Fig. 19(a), there are ﬁve cases: (1) a33 = a11, (2)
a33 = b11, (3) a33 = a22, (4) a33 = b22, (5) a33 is a loop.

Case (1). The union a33 ∪e1 bounds a lens. This contradicts Lemma 6.1.
Case (3). We have b33 = b22. Thus b33 ∪ e2 bounds a lens. This contra-

dicts Lemma 6.1.

Case (4). The union a33 ∪ e2 bounds a disk D′ containing the edge
b33. By (i), we have w(Γ∩IntD′) = 0. Thus we have a contradiction by
IO-Calculation with respect to Γm+ε in D′.

Case (5). We have b33 ∋ w2 because the edge b33 does not contain
a middle arc at w3 (the edge b33 is not a terminal edge by Assumption 2).
Thus w2 ∈ Γm+ε. Hence whether w1 ∈ Γm−ε or w1 ∈ Γm+ε, we have a11 = b11,
because one of a11 and b11 does not contain a middle arc. Thus a11 ∪ ℓ1 is a
solar eclipse. This contradicts Proposition 6.4.

Hence Case (2) occurs. Similarly we can show b33 = a22. Thus the two
edges a11, b22 are terminal edges. By Lemma 3.1(2), both of D1 and D2
contain pseudo charts of the RO-family of the pseudo chart as shown in
Fig. 5(a) (see Fig. 19(b)). There are four edges of Γm+2ε intersecting ∂D1,
say e′
j for i 6= j. Thus the four
edges must contain white vertices in IntD2. However it is impossible that
Int(e′
j) = ∅ for each pair i, j with 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 4. Therefore there is
no pair of skew eyeglasses of type 2 in Γ.

8 Triangle Lemma

Let Γ be a chart, and D a disk. Let α be a simple arc in ∂D. We call a
simple arc γ in an edge of Γk a (D, α)-arc of label k provided that ∂γ ⊂Intα
and Intγ ⊂IntD. If there is no (D, α)-arc in Γ, then the chart Γ is said to be
(D, α)-arc free.

Let Γ be a chart and D a disk. Let α be a simple arc in ∂D. For each
k = 1, 2, · · · , let Σk be the pseudo chart which consists of all arcs in D ∩ Γk
intersecting the set Cl(∂D − α). Let Σα = ∪kΣk.

The following two lemmata will be used in the proof of Lemma 8.3.

Lemma 8.1 ([6, Lemma 3.2]) (Disk Lemma) Let Γ be a minimal chart and
D a disk. Let α be a simple arc in ∂D. Suppose that the interior of α
contains neither white vertices, isolated points of D ∩ Γ, nor arcs of D ∩ Γ.
If IntD does not contain white vertices of Γ, then for any neighborhood V of
α, there exists a (D, α)-arc free minimal chart Γ′ obtained from the chart Γ
by C-moves in V ∪ D keeping Σα ﬁxed (see Fig. 20).

Lemma 8.2 Let Γ be a chart, e an edge of Γm, and w1, w2 the white vertices
in e. Suppose w1 ∈ Γm−1 and w2 ∈ Γm+1. Then for any neighborhood V of
the edge e, there exists a chart Γ′ obtained from the chart Γ by C-I-R2 moves,
C-I-R3 moves and C-I-R4 moves in V keeping Γm−1 ∪ Γm ∪ Γm+1 such that
the edge e does not contain any crossings.

Proof. Let b be a point in Int(e). Since Int(e) ∩ (Γm−1 ∪ Γm+1) = ∅, all the
crossings of Γi (i < m − 1) in the edge e can be moved into the arc e[b, w2] by

23

Figure 21: The gray regions are 3-angled disks D1. The thick lines are edges
of label m, and ε ∈ {+1, −1}.

C-I-R2 moves and C-I-R3 moves. Similarly all the crossings of Γi (i > m + 1)
in the edge e can be moved into the arc e[w1, b] by C-moves.

Since the white vertex w1 is in Γm ∩ Γm−1, we can push each crossing
in the arc e[w1, b] to the side of w1 along the edge e by C-I-R2 moves and
C-I-R4 moves. Similarly we can push each crossing in the arc e[b, w2] to the
side of w2 along the edge e by C-moves. Hence the edge e does not contain
any crossings.
(cid:3)

The following lemma will be used in Step 1 and Step 8 of the proof of

Theorem 1.1.

Lemma 8.3 (Triangle Lemma)

(1) For a chart Γ, if there exists a 3-angled disk D1 of Γm without feelers
in a disk D as shown in Fig. 21(a) and if w(Γ∩IntD1) = 0, then there
exists a chart obtained from Γ by C-moves in D which contains the
pseudo chart in D as shown in Fig. 21(b).

(2) For a minimal chart Γ, if there exists a 3-angled disk D1 of Γm without

feelers in a disk D as shown in Fig. 21(c), then w(Γ∩IntD1) ≥ 1.

Proof. We show Statement (1). We use the notations as shown in Fig. 21(a).

Claim 1. D1 ∩ (Γm−ε ∪ Γm ∪ Γm+ε) = e ∪ e′ ∪ ∂D1.
For, if D1 contains a ring or a hoop of label m − ε, m, m + ε, say C, then
C bounds a disk in D1 not containing any white vertices. This contradicts
Assumption 5. Hence the disk D1 contains neither hoop nor ring of label
m − ε, m, m + ε. Since the disk D1 does not contain any free edges by
Assumption 4, Claim 1 holds.

Claim 2. We can assume that neither e1 nor e contains a crossing by

C-moves.

For, w1 ∈ Γm+ε and w2 ∈ Γm−ε. Thus by Lemma 8.2 we can assume that
the edge e1 of Γm does not contain any crossings. Moreover we can push the
crossings in e to the side of w3 by C-moves as follows. Since the label of the
edge e is m − ε, we have Int(e) ∩ (Γm−2ε ∪ Γm) = ∅. Hence Claim 1 implies

24

Figure 22: The thick lines are edges of label m, and ε ∈ {+1, −1}.

Figure 23: The thick lines are edges of label m, and ε ∈ {+1, −1}.

that we have Int(e) ∩ (Γm−2ε ∪ Γm ∪ Γm+ε) = ∅. Since the white vertex w3
is in Γm−ε ∩ Γm, we can push each crossing in the edge e to the side of w3
along e by C-I-R2 moves and C-I-R4 moves. Hence Claim 2 holds.

Claim 3. We can assume that D1 ∩ Γ = e ∪ e′ ∪ ∂D1 by C-moves.
For, Claim 2 assures that by applying Disk Lemma(Lemma 8.1) twice,
we can assume that Γ is (D1, e2)-arc free and (D1, e3)-arc free. Since D1 does
not contain free edges, hoops nor rings by Assumption 4 and Assumption 5,
we have D1 ∩ Γ = e ∪ e′ ∪ ∂D1. Hence Claim 3 holds.

As shown in Fig. 22, we can deform by C-moves in D from Γ to a chart

containing the pseudo chart as shown in Fig. 21(b).

We show Statement (2). Suppose that a minimal chart Γ contains the
pseudo chart as shown in Fig. 21(c). If w(Γ∩IntD1) = 0, then as shown in
Fig. 23, by the help of Triangle Lemma(Lemma 8.3(1)), we can reduce the
number of white vertices of Γ by C-moves. This contradicts the fact that Γ
is a minimal chart. Hence w(Γ∩IntD1) ≥ 1.
(cid:3)

9 Proof of Theorem 1.1

Now we start to prove Theorem 1.1. We show the theorem by contradiction.
Suppose that there exists a minimal chart Γ with w(Γ) = 7 containing a loop
ℓ of label m. Let D1 be the associated disk of ℓ. Then w(Γm ∩ (S2 − D1)) ≤ 2
by Lemma 6.5. Thus the loop ℓ is contained in a connected component G of
Γm with w(G) ≤ 3. By Lemma 7.1, the graph G is a pair of eyeglasses or a

25

Figure 24: The pair of skew eyeglasses G is the thick lines of label m, the
gray regions are the disks D1, D2.

pair of skew eyeglasses. By Proposition 7.3 and Proposition 7.4, the graph
G is a pair of skew eyeglasses of type 1.

From now on, throughout this section, we assume that

(i) ℓ is the loop of label m in the pair of skew eyeglasses G of type 1,

(ii) w1 is the white vertex in ℓ with w1 ∈ Γm ∩ Γm+ε where ε ∈ {+1, −1},

(iii) Γ is locally minimal with respect to D1 and D2 where D1 is the asso-
ciated disk of ℓ and D2 is the 2-angled disk of Γm with w1 6∈ D2 (see
Fig. 24).

We shall prove Theorem 1.1 by eight steps: If necessary we change all
orientation of edges, we can assume that the edge e1 of label m is oriented
from w2 to w1. We show only the case that ℓ is oriented clockwisely. We use
the notations as shown in Fig. 24.

Step 1. The disk D2 is a 2-angled disk without feelers (i.e. Fig. 24(b)).
Step 2. There exists at least one white vertex of Γm−1 ∪ Γm+1 in S2 −

(D1 ∪ D2), say w7.

Step 3. w(Γ∩IntD1) = 2.
Step 4. There exists a white vertex in S2 − (D1 ∪ D2) diﬀerent from w7,

say w6, and w6, w7 ∈ Γm+ε ∩ Γm+2ε and w2, w3 ∈ Γm+ε.

Step 5. The edge a12 contains one of the white vertices w6, w7.
Without loss of generality we can assume w6 ∈ a12.
Step 6. The edge b33 contains the white vertex w7.
Step 7. The edge a33 contains the white vertex w7.
Step 8. There does not exist a pair of skew eyeglasses of type 1.

Proof of Step 1. Suppose that D2 is a 2-angled disk with one feeler. We

use the notations as shown in Fig. 24(a).

We shall show that Γ contains a pseudo chart as shown in Fig. 25. By
IO-Calculation with respect to Γm±1 in D2 and Cl(S2 − (D1 ∪ D2)), there
exists a white vertex of Γm−1 ∪ Γm+1 in IntD2, say w6, and there exists a
white vertex of Γm−1 ∪ Γm+1 in S2 − (D1 ∪ D2), say w7. Now

26

7 = w(Γ)

(1)

= w(Γ ∩ IntD1) + w(Γ ∩ IntD2) + w(G) + w(Γ ∩ (S2 − (D1 ∪ D2)))
≥ w(Γ ∩ IntD1) + 1 + 3 + 1.

Hence we have w(Γ∩IntD1) ≤ 2. By Lemma 3.1(1), we have w(Γ∩IntD1) =
2. Thus by (1)

(2) w(Γ∩IntD2) = 1 and w(Γ ∩ (S2 − (D1 ∪ D2))) = 1.

Since D2 is a 2-angled disk with one feeler, by (2) and Lemma 3.3 the disk
D2 contains a pseudo chart of the RO-family of the pseudo chart as shown
in Fig. 7(c) (see D2 in Fig. 25).

For the edge b11 in Fig. 24(a), there are two cases: b11 = a11 or b11 ∋ w7.
But if b11 = a11, then we have a solar eclipse b11 ∪ ℓ. This contradicts
Proposition 6.4. Hence b11 ∋ w7.

For the edge a12 in Fig. 24(a), there are two cases: a12 = a11 or a12 ∋ w7.
If a12 = a11, then the edges e1 and a12 separate the annulus Cl(S2−(D1∪D2))
into two regions. Let F be one of the two regions with w7 6∈ F . By (2), we
have w(Γ ∩ F ) = 0. Thus we have a contradiction by IO-Calculation with
respect to Γm+ε in F . Hence a12 ∋ w7.

Since a12 and b11 are oriented inward at w7, we have b12 6∋ w7. Thus we
have b12 = a11, because b12 does not contain a middle arc at w2. Let e7 be
the edge of Γm+ε containing w7 diﬀerent from a12 and b11. Then (2) implies
that e7 is a terminal edge.

We shall show w7 ∈ Γm+2ε. Since w7 ∈ b11 ⊂ Γm+ε, we have w7 ∈ Γm
or w7 ∈ Γm+2ε. If w7 ∈ Γm, then there exists a connected component of Γm
containing exactly one white vertex w7. This contradicts Lemma 4.2. Thus
w7 ∈ Γm+2ε.

Let D3 be the 3-angled disk bounded by a11 ∪ b11 ∪ a12 with e1 ⊂ D3,
If e7 ⊂ D3, then we have a contradiction by IO-Calculation with respect to
Γm+2ε in D3. Thus we have e7 6⊂ D3 (see Fig. 25). Since w7 ∈ S2 −(D1 ∪D2),
(2) implies that

(3) w(Γ∩IntD3) = 0.

Thus the edge of Γm+2ε containing w7 in D3 is a terminal edge. Therefore Γ
contains a pseudo chart as shown in Fig. 25.

However in a neighborhood of D3, the chart Γ contains the pseudo chart
as shown in Fig. 21(c). Now (3) contradicts Triangle Lemma(Lemma 8.3(2)).
Hence D2 is a 2-angled disk without feelers (see Fig. 24(b)). This completes
the proof of Step 1.
(cid:3)

Proof of Step 2. By Step 1, the chart Γ contains the pseudo chart as
shown in Fig. 24(b). We use the notations as shown in Fig. 24(b). Suppose
that there does not exist any white vertices of Γm−1 ∪Γm+1 in S2 −(D1 ∪D2).
By Assumption 2, the edge b11 is not a terminal edge. Thus there are three
cases: (1) b11 = a11, (2) b11 = a33, (3) b11 = b33.

27

Figure 25: The gray region is a 3-angled disk D3.

Case (1). We have a solar eclipse b11 ∪ ℓ. This contradicts Proposi-

tion 6.4.

Case (2). We have b33 = a12. Hence the union b33 ∪ e2 bounds a lens.

This contradicts Lemma 6.1.

Case (3). We have w1, w3 ∈ Γm+ε, because ∂b11 = {w1, w3}. By Assump-
tion 2, the edge a12 is not a terminal edge. Hence a12 = a11 or a12 = a33.
Thus a12 intersects the edge b11. Since w1 ∈ a12 ∩ b11 or w3 ∈ a12 ∩ b11, the
two edges a12 and b11 are of label m + ε. This contradicts Condition (iv) of
the deﬁnition of a chart.

Hence we have a contradiction for any cases. Thus there exists a white
vertex of Γm−1∪Γm+1 in S2−(D1∪D2). This completes the proof of Step 2. (cid:3)

Proof of Step 3. By Step 2

7 = w(Γ)

(*)

≥ w(Γ ∩ IntD1) + w(Γ ∩ IntD1) + w(G) + w(Γ ∩ (S2 − (D1 ∪ D2))
≥ w(Γ ∩ IntD1) + 0 + 3 + 1.

Thus w(Γ∩IntD1) ≤ 3. By Lemma 3.1(1), we have w(Γ∩IntD1) ≥ 2. Hence
it suﬃces to prove w(Γ∩IntD1) 6= 3.

Suppose w(Γ∩IntD1) = 3. By (*), Step 2 and w(Γ) = 7, we have

(**) w(Γ ∩ (S2 − (D1 ∪ D2)) = 1 and w(Γ∩IntD2) = 0.

Let w7 be the white vertex in S2 − (D1 ∪ D2). For the edge b33 in Fig. 24(b),
there are four cases: (1) b33 = a12, (2) b33 = b12, (3) b33 = b11, (4) b33 ∋ w7.

Case (1). The union b33 ∪e2 bounds a lens. This contradicts Lemma 6.1.
Case (2). The edge b33 separates the annulus Cl(S2 − (D1 ∪ D2)) into a
disk and an annulus. Let F be one of the disk and the annulus with w7 6∈ F .
Since w(Γ ∩ (S2 − (D1 ∪ D2)) = 1 by (**), we have w(Γ ∩ F ) = 0. Thus we
have a contradiction by IO-Calculation with respect to Γm±1 in F .

Case (3). We have w1, w3 ∈ Γm+ε. For the edge a12 in Fig. 24(b),
the edge is of label m − ε or m + ε. If a12 is of label m + ε, then we have
a12 ∋ w7 and a33 = b12, because neither a12 nor a33 is a terminal edge by
Assumption 2. Thus the union a33 ∪ e4 bounds a lens. This contradicts
Lemma 6.1. Hence a12 is of label m − ε. Since a12 is not a terminal edge,
we have w7 ∈ a12 ⊂ Γm−ε. Hence w7 ∈ Γm−2ε or w7 ∈ Γm. If w7 ∈ Γm,

28

then there exists a connected component of Γm containing exactly one white
vertex w7. This contradicts Lemma 4.2. Hence w7 ∈ Γm−2ε.

We shall show that Γm−2ε contains exactly one white vertex w7. Since
w(Γ∩IntD1) = 3, w1 ∈ Γm+ε, and since Γ is locally minimal with respect to
D1 by (iii), all the white vertices in IntD1 are contained in Γm+ε ∪ Γm+2ε by
Lemma 3.2. Thus none of the white vertices in IntD1 is contained in Γm−2ε.
Since w1, w2, w3 ∈ Γm, none of w1, w2, w3 is contained in Γm−2ε. Hence Γm−2ε
contains exactly one white vertex w7. This contradicts Lemma 4.2.

Case (4). For the edge b11 in Fig. 24(b), there are three cases: b11 = a11,
b11 = a33 or b11 ∋ w7.
If b11 = a11, then we have a solar eclipse b11 ∪ ℓ.
If b11 = a33 or b11 ∋ w7, then we have
This contradicts Proposition 6.4.
a12 ∋ w7 (see Fig. 26(a)). Since w(Γ∩IntD2) = 0 by (**), the disk D2
contains a pseudo chart of the RO-family of the pseudo chart as shown in
Fig. 7(b) by Lemma 3.3. Since w(Γ ∩ (S2 − (D1 ∪ D2)) = 1 by (**), we have
w(Γ∩IntD3) = 0, here D3 is the disk with ∂D3 = e2 ∪ a12 ∪ b33 and w1 6∈ D3.
This contradicts Lemma 4.4.

Thus we have a contradiction for any cases. Hence w(Γ∩IntD1) 6= 3.
(cid:3)

Therefore w(Γ∩IntD1) = 2. This completes the proof of Step 3.

Proof of Step 4. By Step 3, we have w(Γ∩IntD1) = 2. Since w(Γ) = 7,

we have

(1) w(Γ ∩ (S2 − D1)) = 4.

Since w2, w3 ∈ S2 − D1 and w7 ∈ S2 − D1 by Step 2, there exists a white
vertex in S2 − D1 diﬀerent from w2, w3, w7, say w6. By Lemma 6.3(1) we
have w(Γm+2ε ∩ (S2 − D1)) ≥ 2. Since w2, w3 ∈ Γm (see Fig. 24(b)) we have
w2, w3 6∈ Γm+2ε. Hence we have

(2) w6, w7 ∈ Γm+2ε.

Since w7 ∈ Γm−1 ∪ Γm+1 by Step 2, we have w7 ∈ Γm+ε ∩ Γm+2ε.

By Step 2 and (1), we have

4 = w(Γ ∩ (S2 − D1))

= w(Γ ∩ IntD2) + w(Γ ∩ ∂D2) + w(Γ ∩ (S2 − (D1 ∪ D2)))
≥ w(Γ ∩ IntD2) + 2 + 1.

Hence we have w(Γ∩IntD2) ≤ 1. Since the edges in ∂D2 are oriented from
w3 to w2, we have w(Γ∩IntD2) = 0 by Lemma 3.3 and Step 1. Thus w6 ∈
S2 − (D1 ∪ D2).

By (2), we have w6 ∈ Γm+2ε. Thus w6 ∈ Γm+ε or w6 ∈ Γm+3ε. Suppose
w6 ∈ Γm+3ε. Since w(Γ∩IntD1) = 2, by Lemma 3.1(2) the white vertices in
IntD1 are in Γm+ε ∩Γm+2ε. Thus Γm+3ε contains exactly one white vertex w6.
This contradicts Lemma 4.2. Hence w6 ∈ Γm+ε. Thus w6 ∈ Γm+ε ∩ Γm+2ε.

We can show w2, w3 ∈ Γm−ε or w2, w3 ∈ Γm+ε by IO-Calculation with re-
spect to Γm−ε in Cl(S2 − (D1 ∪ D2)). If w2, w3 ∈ Γm−ε, then there exist two

29

Figure 26: The gray region is the disk D3.

lenses of type (m, m − ε). This contradicts Lemma 6.1. Thus w2, w3 ∈ Γm+ε.
This completes the proof of Step 4.
(cid:3)

By Step 3, Step 4, Lemma 3.1(2) and Lemma 3.3, we have the pseudo
chart as shown in Fig. 26(b). From now on, we use the notations as shown
in Fig. 26(b).

Proof of Step 5. For the edge a12 in Fig. 26(b), there are four cases: (1)

a12 = a11, (2) a12 = a33, (3) a12 = b33, (4) a12 contains one of w6, w7.

Case (1). The edges a12, e1 separate the annulus Cl(S2 − (D1 ∪ D2)) into
two regions. Each region must contain a white vertex in its interior. In one
of the regions, there exists a loop of label m + ε whose associated disk does
not contain any white vertices in its interior. This contradicts Lemma 3.1(1).
Case (2). The edges a12 separates the annulus Cl(S2 − (D1 ∪ D2)) into
two regions. In a similar way to Case (1), we can show that there exists a
loop of label m + ε whose associated disk does not contain any white vertices
in its interior. This contradicts Lemma 3.1(1).

Case (3). The union a12 ∪e2 bounds a lens. This contradicts Lemma 6.1.
Thus Case (4) occurs. This completes the proof of Step 5.
(cid:3)

Proof of Step 6. For the edge b33 in Fig. 26(b), there are four cases: (1)

b33 = b11, (2) b33 = b12, (3) b33 ∋ w6, (4) b33 ∋ w7.

Case (1). The edges b11, e1 separate the annulus Cl(S2 − (D1 ∪ D2))
into two regions. Let F be one of the two regions containing w6 ∈ a12. If
w7 ∈ F , then a33 = b12. Hence the union a33 ∪ e4 bounds a lens. This
contradicts Lemma 6.1. If w7 6∈ F , then there exists a loop of label m + ε in
F whose associated disk does not contain any white vertices in its interior.
This contradicts Lemma 3.1(1).

Case (2). The edges b11 separate the annulus Cl(S2 − (D1 ∪ D2)) into
two regions. Let F be one of the two regions containing a33. Then F must
contain w7. Thus there exists a loop of label m + ε in F whose associated
disk does not contain any white vertices in its interior. This contradicts
Lemma 3.1(1).

Case (3). By Lemma 4.4 the disk D3 bounded by a12 ∪ b33 ∪ e2 contains
at least one white vertex in its interior as shown in Fig. 26(a). Thus w7 ∈ D3.

30

Figure 27: The gray region is the disk D3.

For the white vertex w7, there are two edges of Γm+ε not containing middle
arcs. One contains w6, and the other is a loop. Hence there exists a loop of
label m + ε in D3 whose associated disk does not contain any white vertices
in its interior. This contradicts Lemma 3.1(1).

Hence Case (4) occurs. This completes the proof of Step 6.

(cid:3)

Proof of Step 7. For the edge a33 in Fig. 26(b), there are four cases: (1)

a33 = b12, (2) a33 = b11, (3) a33 ∋ w6, and (4) a33 ∋ w7.

Case (1). The union a33 ∪e4 bounds a lens. This contradicts Lemma 6.1.
Case (2). We have b12 = a11. Let e7 be an edge of Γm+ε with w7 ∈ e7
diﬀerent from b33 not containing a middle arc at w7. By Assumption 2, the
edge e7 is not a terminal edge. Thus e7 is a loop or w6 ∈ e7.
If e7 is a
loop, then the associated disk of e7 does not contain any white vertices in its
interior. This contradicts Lemma 3.1(1). Hence w6 ∈ e7.

There are four edges of Γm+2ε intersecting ∂D1, say e′

4. Since
there is no lens by Lemma 6.1, each of the four edges must contain one of
w6, w7. Thus there are two terminal edges of Γm+ε in the disk D3 containing
w6, w7 respectively (see Fig. 27(a)). However it is impossible that for each
pair 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 4 with Int(e′

1, e′

2, e′

3, e′

i)∩Int(e′

j) = ∅.

Case (3). There exists an edge e7 of Γm+ε containing w7 diﬀerent from
b33 not containing a middle arc at w7. In a similar way to Case (2), we can
show w6 ∈ e7. Let e′
7 be the edge of Γm+ε containing w7 diﬀerent from b33
and e7. Then e′
7 is a terminal edge. However we have a contradiction by IO-
Calculation with respect to Γm+2ε in the disk D3 bounded by a33 ∪ b33 ∪ e7
containing e3 (see Fig. 27(b) for the case D3 ⊃ e′

7).

Hence Case (4) occurs. This completes the proof of Step 7.

(cid:3)

Proof of Step 8. So far, we have a pseudo chart as shown in Fig. 28(a). For
the edge b11 in Fig. 28(a), there are three cases: (1) b11 = a11, (2) b11 ∋ w7,
(3) b11 ∋ w6.

Case (1). We have a solar eclipse. This contradicts Proposition 6.4.
Case (2). There exists a loop of label m + ε containing w6 whose associ-
ated disk does not contain any white vertices in its interior. This contradicts

31

Lemma 3.1(1).

Case (3). There are two cases: b12 ∋ w7 or b12 = a11. But if b12 ∋ w7,
then the union b12 ∪ a33 ∪ e4 bounds a disk D′ with w(Γ∩IntD′) = 0. This
contradicts Lemma 4.4. Hence b12 = a11.

Let e6 be the edge of Γm+ε containing w6 diﬀerent from a12, b11. Let D3

be the disk bounded by a12 ∪ b12 ∪ b11 with e1 ⊂ D3. Then

(*) w(Γ∩IntD3) = 0.

If e6 ⊂ D3, then we have a contradiction by IO-Calculation with respect to
Γm+2ε in D3. Thus we have e6 6⊂ D3 and there exists a terminal edge of
Γm+2ε containing w6 in D3.

Now e6 is a terminal edge or e6 ∋ w7. If e6 is a terminal edge, then in
a neighborhood of D3, the chart Γ contains the pseudo chart as shown in
Fig. 21(c). By Triangle Lemma(Lemma 8.3(2)), we have w(Γ∩IntD3) ≥ 1.
This contradicts (*). Hence e6 is not a terminal edge. Thus e6 ∋ w7 (see
Fig. 28(b)).

3, (3-3) e′

1, there are four cases: (3-1) e′
1 = b66.

Case (3-1). There exists a lens of type (m + ε, m + 2ε). This contradicts

Lemma 6.1.

Let e′ be the edge of Γm+ε in D1 containing w1, and D4 the 2-angled disk

of Γm+ε in D1.

Case (3-2). The edge e′

1 separates the annulus Cl(S2 − D4) into two
regions. Let F be the one of the two regions containing the edge e′
2. Then
w(Γ∩IntF ) = 0. Hence we have a contradiction by IO-Calculation with
respect to Γm+2ε in F .

Case (3-3). The simple arc e′

1 ∪ e′ separates the annulus Cl(S2 − D3)
into two regions. Let F be the one of the two regions containing the edge
b66. Then IntF does not contain any white vertices except w3 and w7. Hence
we have a contradiction by IO-Calculation with respect to Γm+2ε in F .

Thus Case (3-4) occurs. In a neighborhood of D3, the chart Γ contains
the pseudo chart as shown in Fig. 21(a). By Triangle Lemma(Lemma 8.3(1)),
we obtain a chart containing the pseudo chart as shown in Fig. 21(b) (see
Fig. 28(c)). Apply a C-III move to the chart as shown in Fig. 28(c), we
obtain a minimal chart as shown in Fig. 28(d). However there exists a lens of
type (m + ε, m + 2ε). This contradicts Lemma 6.1. Therefore there does not
exist a pair of skew eyeglasses of type 1. This completes the proof of Step 8,
and the proof of Theorem 1.1.
