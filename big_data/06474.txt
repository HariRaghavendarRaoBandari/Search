Experimental Gravity Physics

Abstract. The experimental study of gravity became much more ac-
tive in the late 1950s, a change pronounced enough be termed the
naissance of empirical gravity physics. A review of the developments
since 1915, and up to the transition to what might be termed a normal
and accepted part of physical science in the late 1960s, shows the im-
portance of advances in technologies, here as in all branches of science.
The role of contingency is illustrated by Robert Dicke’s decision to
change directions in mid-career, to lead a research group dedicated to
the experimental study of gravity. One sees the power of nonempirical
evidence, which led some in the 1950s to feel that general relativity the-
ory is so logically sound as to be scarcely worth the testing, while Dicke
and others argued that a poorly tested theory is only that, and that
other nonempirical arguments, based on Mach’s Principle and Dirac’s
Large Numbers, suggested it was worth looking for a better theory of
gravity. I conclude by oﬀering lessons from this history, some pecu-
liar to the study of gravity physics during the naissance, some of more
general relevance. The central lesson, which is familiar but not always
well advertised, is that physical theories can be empirically established,
sometimes with surprising results.

1 Introduction

This is an examination of how the experimental study of gravity grew in the late 1950s
and through the 1960s. The subject was a small science then that can be examined
in some detail in the space of this paper. It oﬀers a particularly clear illustration of
the importance of ideas as well as technology in the origins of lines of research, which
in this case have grown into Big Science.

In the mid 1950s the experimental exploration of gravity physics was generally
considered uninteresting. This was in part because there seemed to be little that
could be done, apart from incremental improvements of the three classical tests of
general relativity. But a serious contributing factor was that inﬂuential scientists
accepted general relativity theory as a compellingly logical extension from classical
electromagnetism to the theory of gravity. (An excellent example is the presentation
in Landau and Lifshitz 1951, in the ﬁrst English translation of the 1948 edition of
The Theory of Fields.) I take this broad acceptance of Einstein’s general relativity, at

a time when it had little empirical basis, to be an argument from the “nonempirical
evidence” that respected scientists found the theory to be a logically compelling
extension of what had come before. The term is borrowed from Dawid (2015), who
argued for the merits of “non-empirical theory assessment” in present-day string
theory, where the prospects for empirical assessment seem to be even more remote
than it seemed for gravity physics in the 1950s. In Dawid’s (2016) words,

By the term non-empirical conﬁrmation I denote conﬁrmation of a theory
by observations that lie beyond the theory’s intended domain: unlike in the
case of empirical conﬁrmation, the conﬁrming observations are not predicted
by the theory they conﬁrm. Non-empirical conﬁrmation resembles empirical
conﬁrmation, however, in being based on observations about the world beyond
the theory and its endorsers. Main examples of non-empirical conﬁrmation are
based on the observations that scientists have not succeeded in ﬁnding serious
alternatives to a given theory, that in some sense comparable theories in the
research ﬁeld have turned out predictively successful once tested, and that a
theory provides explanations that had not been aimed at during the theory’s
construction.

My use of the term “nonempirical evidence,” in a second theme of this paper, is meant
to be in line with this statement, but I have ventured to include considerations of the
vague but commonly applied criterion of elegance, or simplicity. I take as prototype
for this criterion Einstein’s (1945, p. 127) comment about the cosmological constant,
Λ, in the appendix for the second edition of The Meaning of Relativity:

The introduction of the “cosmologic member” into the equations of gravity,
though possible from the point of view of relativity, is to be rejected from the
point of view of logical economy.

The term Λ in Einstein’s ﬁeld equation remained unpopular among inﬂuential scien-
tists in the 1950s, and increasingly so through the 1990s. But despite its inelegance
Λ was eventually added to the standard and accepted theory under the pressure of
experimental advances. But we may counter that with a prime example of the suc-
cessful application of nonempirical evidence, to general relativity theory, which now
passes demanding empirical tests.

The change in thinking about the possibilities of the probes of gravity that led
to its experimental establishment is part of what Will (1986) termed the renaissance
of general relativity, and Blum, Lalli, and Renn (2015) termed its reinvention. Both
names are appropriate for the subject as a whole, but on the empirical side the
connotation of revival is inappropriate, because not a lot had happened earlier. There
was a paradigm shift in community opinion, in the sense of Kuhn’s (1962) Structure
of Scientiﬁc Revolutions: In the 1950s it was generally accepted that there is little of
interest to do in experimental gravity physics, as one sees in the heavy ratio of theory
to experiment in the international conferences in the 1950s reviewed in Section 2,
while in the 1960s new directions in experimental programs were becoming a familiar
and accepted part of science. But since there was not a shift in standard and accepted
fundamental physics I use the term “naissance of experimental gravity.”

I take this naissance to have started in 1957, at the Chapel Hill Conference on
The Role of Gravitation in Physics (DeWitt 1957), where Dicke (1957a) emphasized
the sparse experimental exploration of gravity physics, the promise of new technology
that could help improve the situation, and experiments to this end in progress in his
group. Others may have been thinking along similar lines, but Dicke was alone in
making a clear statement of the situation in print and starting a long-term broad-
based program of empirical investigations of gravity. I take the naissance to have
lasted about a decade before maturing into a part of normal science.

Ideas are important to the general advance of science, but they may play a particu-
larly big role in the origins of a research activity. A clear illustration is the ideas Dicke
and others found for new lines of research from old arguments associated with Ernst
Mach and Paul A. M. Dirac. This situation was important enough to the development
of modern gravity physics to be reviewed in some detail, in Section 4.

Section 2 reviews the state of thinking about general relativity as a physical sci-
ence at the start of the naissance, as revealed by the proceedings of international
conferences in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Two of the leading actors at the time
were John Archibald Wheeler and Robert Henry Dicke; their thinking is discussed
in Section 3. Section 4 reviews ideas that motivated Dicke and others, and Section 5
presents a consideration of the style of exploration of these and other ideas in what
became known as the Gravity Research Group, as exempliﬁed by accounts of the
two experiments in progress that Dicke mentioned at the Chapel Hill Conference.
Section 6 presents more brief reviews of other signiﬁcant advances in experimental
gravity physics from 1915 through to the nominal end of the naissance. The great lines
of research that have grown out of this early work have shown us that the theory Ein-
stein completed a century ago ﬁts an abundance of experimental and observational
evidence, on scales ranging from the laboratory to the Solar system and on out to
the observable universe. This is a striking success for assessment from nonempirical
evidence, but I hope not to be considered an anticlimax. As noted, we have been
forced to add Einstein’s (1917) cosmological constant, despite its general lack of ap-
peal. Empirical evidence can be surprising. Lessons to be drawn from this and other
aspects of the history are discussed in Section 7.1

1 This paper was written in the culture of physics, and certainly could be made more
complete by broader considerations. In Section 7.5 I discuss support for research during
the naissance by agencies normally associated with the military. The thoughts expressed in
Section 7.5 on why the agencies were doing this are only speculation: more may be known or
knowable. Private companies also supported research in gravity physics. Howard Forward is
listed as a Hughes Aircraft Company Staﬀ Doctoral Fellow in the paper by Forward, Zipoy,
Weber, et al. (1961), on modes of oscillation of the Earth, which ﬁgured in the search for
gravitational waves (Sec. 6.6). George Gamow’s tour as a consultant to General Dynamics
in the 1950s is celebrated for the missed chance for Gamow and Hoyle to hit on the CMB
(as recalled by Hoyle 1981). I do not know how common such connections between industry
and gravity physics were, but as graduate students we joked that the aircraft companies
hoped to ﬁnd antigravity. Likely there was more to it than that. The Hughes Fellowship
still exists, but I understand now focusses on more practical training. During the naissance
nontenured faculty in physics at Princeton typically had appointments halftime teaching and
halftime research, the latter supported by a funding agency. It allowed many more junior
faculty than positions available for tenure. The junior faculty were supposed to beneﬁt from
experience and contacts that could lead to jobs elsewhere, usually successfully. And research
greatly beneﬁtted from many active young people. My impression is that this comfortable
arrangement at elite universities ended during the Vietnam War, possibly a casualty of
resentment of particularly loud draft protests at elite universities that perhaps were least
seriously aﬄicted by the draft. This, with the Mansﬁeld Amendment, contributed to what
I consider a slight hardening of the arteries of pure curiosity-driven research, but I do not
know how to judge the actual eﬀect. In Section 3 I brieﬂy mention Wheeler and Dicke’s
peaceful coexistence with their quite diﬀerent goals of research in gravitation. Historians
might see room for closer examination of this situation, and I expect many other aspects of
how empirical gravity physics grew.

2 General relativity and experimental gravity physics in the 1950s

The modest state of experimental research in gravity physics in the mid-1950s is
illustrated by the proceedings of the July 1955 Berne Conference, Jubilee of Relativity
Theory (Mercier and Kervaire 1956), on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of special
relativity theory, the 40th for general relativity. Of the 34 papers in the proceedings
there is just one on the fundamental empirical basis for general relativity: Trumpler’s
(1956) review of the modest advances in two of the original tests of general relativity,
measurements of the deﬂection of light by the Sun and of the gravitational redshift
of light from stars. Baade presented an important development, his correction to the
extragalactic distance scale. He did not contribute to the proceedings, but the record
of discussions of his report includes Robertson’s (1956) comment on the possible need
for “the disreputable Λ.” Einstein’s Λ became part of established gravity physics, but
this happened a half-century later.

The experimental situation was improving, though slowly at ﬁrst. At the March
1957 Chapel Hill Conference on The Role of Gravitation in Physics (DeWitt 1957),
Dicke (1957a) stressed the contrast between the scant experimental work in gravity
physics and the dense tests and experimental applications of quantum physics, and
he outlined a research program he had commenced a few years earlier aimed at im-
proving the situation. The only other commentary in the proceedings on empirical
advances was Lilley’s (1957) review of radio astronomy. Of immediate interest was
the possibility of distinguishing between the Steady State and relativistic cosmolog-
ical models by counts of radio sources as a function of ﬂux density, but the counts
proved to be faulty. Of lasting interest was the isotropy of the counts, an early hint
to the large-scale homogeneity of the observable universe (Sec. 6.13).

At the June 1959 Royaumont Conference on Les Th´eories Relativistes de la Grav-
itation (Lichnerowicz and Tonnelat 1962), Weber (1962) presented an analysis of how
to build a gravitational wave detector. This was the only experimental paper among
the 46 in the proceedings, and one may wonder how edifying the more technical as-
pects were to an audience that likely was almost entirely theorists. But Weber was
introducing a new direction in the experimental investigation of general relativity
theory.

We see a strikingly abrupt change of emphasis to the search for empirical probes
of gravity in the July 1961 NASA Conference on Experimental Tests of Theories of
Relativity (Roman 1961). Discussions of projects to which NASA could contribute
included measurements of relativistic timekeeping in artiﬁcial satellites; tracking of
artiﬁcial satellite orbits, including a satellite that shields a test mass from atmospheric
drag and light pressure by jets that keep the test mass centered; the design conditions
for a test of the relativistic Lense-Thirring inertial frame-dragging eﬀect; and a search
for detection of gravitational waves on a quieter site, the Moon.

The general lack of interest in experimental general relativity and gravity physics
in the 1950s was at least in part a result of competition from many interesting things to
do in other branches of physics, from elementary particles to biophysics. But ongoing
advances of technology were oﬀering new possibilities for better probes of relativity.
In some cases a particular technical advance motivated a speciﬁc experiment. For
example, by 1955 Townes’s group had a working ammonia beam maser (Gordon,
Zeiger, and Townes 1955); Møller (1957) acknowledged “stimulating discussions” with
Townes “on problems of general relativity in connection with the maser;” and a year
after that Townes’s group published a variant of the Kennedy-Thorndike aether drift
experiment (Cedarholm, Bland, Havens, and Townes 1958; as discussed below in
Sec. 6.2). And we see that, a year after publication of the M¨ossbauer (1958) eﬀect,
Pound and Rebka (1959) announced their plan to use it for an attempt at a laboratory
detection of the gravitational redshift, and Pound and Rebka (1960) announced the

detection a year after that (as reviewed in Sec. 6.4). Dicke followed this pattern, but
with a particular diﬀerence: he was systematically casting about for experiments that
may help improve the empirical basis for gravity physics.

3 Wheeler and Dicke

At the Chapel Hill Conference the two lead speakers were John Archibald Wheeler,
on new ideas in classical general relativity theory, and Robert Henry Dicke, on new
ideas on the experimental side. They are shown in Figure 1 with other members of the
senior faculty of the Department of Physics at Princeton University in about 1950.
The photograph was taken a few years before both decided to turn to research in
relativity and gravitation (when they were in mid-career: Wheeler was 44 and Dicke
39 in 1955).

Wheeler’s research interests had been in theoretical nuclear, particle, and atomic
physics. In his autobiography (Wheeler and Ford 1998, p. 228) Wheeler recalled that
his notes from 1952 revealed that he had learned “from Shenstone 1/2 hour ago that
I can teach relativity next year” which was “my ﬁrst step into territory that would
grip my imagination and command my research attention for the rest of my life.”
(Allen Shenstone, then chair of physics, is second from the left in Figure 1.) By the
end of the 1950s Wheeler was leading an active research group in theoretical general

relativity, with participation by students, postdocs, faculty, and a steady stream of
visitors.

Dicke recalled (in Lightman and Brawer 1990, p. 204) that during sabbatical leave
at Harvard in 1954-55 he was thinking about the E¨otv¨os experiment, which tests
whether the acceleration of gravity may depend on the nature of the test particle.
The constraint was remarkably tight, but Dicke saw that it could be done even better
with the much better technology he could use. Bill Hoﬀmann (2016), who was a
graduate student then, recalled that Dicke returned from Harvard “all ﬁred up about
gravity experiments.” The quite abrupt change in direction of his active research
career to gravity from what might be summarily termed quantum optics is illustrated
by the list in Appendix A of the research topics of his graduate students before and
after turning to gravity physics.2

We have samples of what Wheeler and Dicke were thinking as they turned to
investigations of relativity and gravity physics from their papers in the proceedings of
the Chapel Hill Conference. The title of Wheeler’s (1957) paper, The Present Position
of Classical Relativity Theory and Some of its Problems, reﬂects the separation of
topics at the conference to “Unquantized” and “Quantized” general relativity. The
latter was as fascinating, challenging and widely debated then as it is now. The left
panel in Figure 2 shows an example of Wheeler’s new thinking in classical relativity: a
wormhole in space-time threaded by electric ﬂux, giving us “charge without charge.”
He also spoke of “mass without mass,” in his concept of a geon produced by the
nonlinear interaction of electromagnetic and spacetime curvature ﬁelds. Wheeler’s
imaginative approach to physics, and his modes of instruction of graduate students,
produced great science and great generations of scientists. His inspiring style is seen
in his opening paragraph in the Chapel Hill proceedings:

We are here to consider an extraordinary topic, one that ranges from the
inﬁnitely large to the inﬁnitely small. We want to ﬁnd what general relativity
and gravitation physics have to do with the description of nature. This task
imposes a heavy burden of judgement and courage on us, for never before
has theoretical physics had to face such wide subject matter, assisted by so
comprehensive a theory but so little tested by experiment.

Wheeler’s part in the renaissance of the theoretical side of general relativity de-
serves a study that would expand on his recollections in Wheeler and Ford (1998),
but only a few brief points may be noted here. The presence of singularly active
research groups in gravity theory and experiment in the same physics department,

commencing in the 1950s, cannot have been planned: Wheeler and Dicke turned to
relativity and gravity from other research directions well after arriving at Princeton.
The presence of Einstein at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, and the rela-
tivist Howard Percy Robertson, who was based at Princeton University from 1929 to
1947, may have set a tradition that had some inﬂuence. Perhaps that is exempliﬁed
by Wheeler’s feeling, which I heard expressed on occasion, that a philosophically sat-
isfying universe has closed space sections, as Einstein had argued in the 1920s (and is
reviewed in Sec. 4). Wheeler took an active interest in what was happening in Dicke’s
group, but he seemed far more interested in studying the physical signiﬁcance of gen-
eral relativity theory as Einstein wrote it down, and the possible approaches to its
quantization. Wheeler was not inclined to question the validity of Einstein’s relativ-
ity. Dicke was actively casting about for evidence that might lead to an even better
theory. In my recollection Wheeler and Dicke were comfortable with this diﬀerence,
but I do not know of any examples of joint research or more than casual exchanges of
ideas between the two. I recall that other senior members of the physics department
in the early 1960s felt that the path to a ﬁnal fundamental theory would be through
particle physics. They respected Dicke and Wheeler as excellent physicists, who had
made curious career choices.

Dicke’s thinking is illustrated by these quotes from his Chapel Hill paper, The

Experimental Basis of Einstein’s Theory:

It is unfortunate to note that the situation with respect to the experimental
checks of general relativity theory is not much better than it was a few years
after the theory was discovered — say in 1920. This is in striking contrast to the
situation with respect to quantum theory, where we have literally thousands
of experimental checks.

. . .

Professor Wheeler has already discussed the three famous checks of general
relativity; this is really very ﬂimsy evidence on which to hang a theory.

. . .

It is a great challenge to the experimental physicist to try to improve this situ-
ation; to try to devise new experiments and reﬁne old ones to give new checks
on the theory. We have been accustomed to thinking that gravity can play
no role in laboratory-scale experiments; that the gradients are too small, and
that all gravitational eﬀects are equivalent to a change of frame of reference.
Recently I have been changing my views about this.

In the second of these quotes Dicke was referring to Wheeler’s summary comments
on the classical three tests of general relativity: the orbit of the planet Mercury, the
gravitational deﬂection of light passing near the Sun, and the gravitational redshift
of light from stars. As it happens, the redshift test Wheeler mentioned, the measured
shifts in the spectra of two white dwarf stars in binary systems, proved to be accurate
in one case but quite erroneous in the other (as discussed in Sec. 6.4). Wheeler and
Dicke might instead have referred to the measured wavelength shifts of solar absorp-
tion lines (St. John 1928), but this test was problematic because the measured shifts
varied across the face of the Sun and varied with the depth of origin of the lines
in the solar atmosphere, largely results of turbulence. The measured solar redshifts
were roughly in line with general relativity, however, tending to scatter around the
predicted value by no more than about 25%, so one might say that in 1957 general
relativity had passed about two and a half tests.

At the Chapel Hill Conference Dicke mentioned work in progress in his group,

largely in the discussion, beginning with this exchange:

BERGMANN: What is the status of the experiments which it is rumored are
being done at Princeton?

8

The European Physical Journal H

DICKE: There are two experiments being started now. One is an improved
measurement of “g” to detect possible annual variations. This is coming nicely,
and I think we can improve earlier work by a factor of ten. This is done by
using a very short pendulum, without knife edges, just suspended by a quartz
ﬁber, oscillating at a high rate of around 30 cycles/sec. instead of the long slow
pendulum. The other experiment is a repetition of the E¨otv¨os experiment. We
put the whole system in a vacuum to get rid of Brownian motion disturbances;
we use better geometry than E¨otv¨os used; and instead of looking for deﬂections,
the apparatus would be in an automatic feed-back loop such that the position
is held ﬁxed by feeding in external torque to balance the gravitational torque.
This leads to rapid damping, and allows you to divide time up so that you don’t
need to average over long time intervals, but can look at each separate interval
of time. This is being instrumented; we are worrying about such questions as
temperature control of the room right now, because we’d like stability of the
temperature to a thousandth of a degree, which is a bit diﬃcult for the whole
room.
. . .

We have been working on an atomic clock, with which we will be able to
measure variations in the moon’s rotation rate. Astronomical observations are
accurate enough so that, with a good atomic clock, it should be possible in
three years’ time to detect variations in “g” of the size of the eﬀects we have
been considering. We are working on a rubidium clock, which we hope may be
good to one part in 1010.

In these comments Dicke mentioned three experimental projects. Tracking the
motion of the Moon is reviewed in Section 6.10.2. The pendulum and E¨otv¨os exper-
iments are discussed in Section 5, for the purpose of illustrating how Dicke’s group
operated.

In the third of the above quotes Dicke mentioned that “I have been changing my
views.” Though not stated at this point in the discussion, it seems likely that his new
views included the comments earlier in the paper about the table on the right-hand
side of Figure 2 (copied from the Chapel Hill paper) on the idea that the strengths
of the gravitational and weak interactions may evolve as the universe expands. (This
idea, and a more detailed discussion of the table, is discussed in Dicke 1957b.) We may
suppose that Dicke’s change of views also included his interest in Mach’s Principle,
for although he did not mention Mach in the Chapel Hill proceedings he advanced
arguments along Machian ideas in Dicke (1957c). The next section reviews these
ideas, their inﬂuence on Dicke and others, and their role in shaping the progress of
experimental gravity physics.

4 Mach’s Principle, Dirac’s Large Numbers, and
scalar-tensor gravity theory

Considerations along lines discussed in this section motivated Einstein in his devel-
opment of general relativity and basic elements of modern cosmology, Jordan in his
creation of the scalar-tensor gravity theory, and Dicke in his leadership in the develop-
ment of empirical gravity physics. These loosely speciﬁed ideas have never been part
of the broadly accepted belief system in physics and astronomy, but they are impor-
tant for an understanding of how empirical gravity physics grew, and they continue
to attract interest, for evolving reasons.

4.1 Mach’s Principle

Just as motion may be considered meaningful only relative to the rest of the matter in
the universe, it is logical to some to conjecture that inertial motion is meaningful only
relative to what the rest of the matter is doing. The idea has a long history; it is most
familiar now from the discussion in Ernst Mach’s book, The Science of Mechanics
(Mach 1893; p. 284 in the 1960 edition of the English translation). Mach commented
on Newton’s point, that if the surface of the water in a bucket is curved then the
bucket is observed to be rotating relative to the distant stars. This could be taken to
mean that rotation has an absolute meaning, but Mach and others questioned that.
In Mach’s words (translated from the German),

No one is competent to say how the experiment would turn out if the sides
of the vessel increased in thickness and mass till they were ultimately several
leagues thick. The one experiment only lies before us, and our business is,
to bring it into accord with the other facts known to us, and not with the
arbitrary ﬁctions of our imagination.

Mach’s admonition is in line with the theme of this paper: experiments matter (though
Mach’s positivist-empiricist philosophy was overly strict about imagination: Einstein’s
great imagination led to general relativity theory, which now proves to ﬁt many facts
later derived from experiments). The quote could be read to mean that the rotation
of a very massive bucket might be expected to drag the motion of an inertial frame
deﬁned by local measurements, including the behavior of the water in the bucket.
This would be an elegant anticipation of relativistic Lense-Thirring inertial frame
dragging near a rotating mass concentration such as the Earth. It is simplest to
imagine a spherical shell of mass M and radius R rotating at angular velocity Ω.
The general relativity prediction, in lowest approximation, is that an inertial frame
inside the shell precesses relative to distant matter at angular velocity, ω, in order of
magnitude,

ω ∼ GM

Rc2 Ω.

(1)

The successful test of this relativistic prediction applied outside the solid Earth is
discussed in Section 6.8.

If in equation (1) we replace M by the observable mass of the universe in the
relativistic Friedman-Lemaˆıtre cosmology that is expanding at about escape velocity,
and we replace R by the Hubble length (the distance at which the linear relation
between the distances of galaxies and their redshifts extrapolates to apparent recession
velocity equal to the velocity of light), then the factor GM/Rc2 is of order unity, or
ω ∼ Ω. Brill and Cohen (1966) examined this situation. It might invite one to imagine
that, if the observable universe were said to be rotating, then local inertial frames
would rotate with it, which is to say that the rotation would be meaningless. We may
consider this qualitative argument to be one version of Mach’s Principle.

The broader physical implication of Mach’s massive rotating bucket argument are
still debated. Einstein, in his 1921 lectures on The Meaning of Relativity (Einstein
1923), noted that in general relativity theory a galaxy in otherwise empty asymptot-
ically ﬂat space-time could rotate, with all the usual eﬀects of rotation, but it would
be rotation relative to an otherwise empty universe. Einstein argued that, if this sit-
uation were allowed, it would mean that “Mach was wholly wrong in his thought
that inertia, as well as gravitation, depends upon a kind of mutual action between
bodies” and that “from the standpoint of epistemology it is more satisfying to have
the mechanical properties of space completely determined by matter, and this is the
case only in a space-bounded universe” (Einstein 1923, p. 119). In subsequent edi-
tions the sentence ends “only in a closed universe.” Wheeler continued to argue for

10

The European Physical Journal H

the philosophical appeal of this argument for a closed near homogeneous relativis-
tic universe (as one sees in Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler 1973, §21.12). Following
Einstein (1923), some take Mach’s Principle to be that a philosophically acceptable
universe is described by a solution of Einstein’s ﬁeld equation in which inertial motion
everywhere is determined solely by the distribution and motion of matter everywhere.
The considerations presented in the 1921 lectures may account for Einstein’s
(1917) bold proposal that, apart from local ﬂuctuations, the universe is homoge-
nous, despite the lack of any empirical evidence of it at the time. His 1917 argument
for homogeneity is diﬃcult to follow, but the 1921 reasoning seems clear: homogene-
ity would prohibit the phenomenon of non-Machian inertia in an asymptotically ﬂat
space that contains only a single concentration of matter. The concept of large-scale
homogeneity (which might be stated to be that the universe is a spatially stationary
and isotropic random process) has come to be known as Einstein’s Cosmological Prin-
ciple. It was very inﬂuential in the development of cosmology well before there was
any observational evidence in support of homogeneity. The network of well-checked
cosmological tests we have now make a persuasive case for Einstein’s Cosmological
Principle from Mach’s Principle (Sec. 6.13.3), which may be counted as a notable
example of the power of nonempirical evidence — when it is right.

One may debate whether the application of the Cosmological Principle really
makes general relativity theory Machian. The issue does not seem to have long inter-
ested Einstein, but Machian ideas continued to fascinate others. We have noted that
general relativity theory allows the same local frame-dragging in equation (1) in a
universes that satisﬁes the Cosmological Principle but has an arbitrarily small mean
mass density. Dicke’s thinking, as I recall it, was that this means Einstein’s theory is
unsatisfactory: We need a better one that would make the distinction between inertial
and noninertial motion meaningless in a universe that is empty apart from some test
particles with arbitrarily small masses.

Examples of thoughts along such directions are to be found in Sciama (1953,
1964), Brans and Dicke (1961), Lynden-Bell (2010), and articles in the book, Mach’s
Principle: From Newton’s Bucket to Quantum Gravity (Barbour and Pﬁster 1995).
The sense of the thinking may be captured in Sciama’s (1953) proposal that “if local
phenomena are strongly coupled to the universe as a whole, then local observations
can give us information about the universe as a whole.” Such ideas, perhaps drawn
from interpretations of Mach’s principle, perhaps drawn from some other holistic
concept of physical reality, inspired many of the gravity experiments discussed in
Sections 5 and 6.

4.2 Dirac’s Large Numbers Hypothesis

Another line of thought that was inﬂuential during the naissance started with the ob-
servation that the ratio of electrostatic to gravitational forces of attraction of a proton
and electron is an exceedingly large number, the ratio of the expansion time t in the
relativistic Friedman-Lemaˆıtre cosmology to the characteristic time e2/mec3 deﬁned
by atomic parameters also is an exceedingly large number, and the two numbers have
the same order of magnitude:

e2

Gmpme

∼ t

mec3
e2 ∼ 1040 ∼ N.

(2)

Here me and mp are the masses of the electron and proton, e is the magnitude of their
charge, and c is the velocity of light. The number np of protons in the observable part
of the universe, in the relativistic model, is really large, on the order of np ∼ N 2. Dirac

Will be inserted by the editor

11

(1937) mentioned Eddington’s discussion of these large numbers (without citation; he
may have meant Eddington 1936 p. 272). Dirac’s Large Numbers Hypothesis (LNH)
was that these numbers are very large because N has been increasing for a very
long time, and that the parameters in equation (2) have been changing in such a
way as to preserve rough equality of the two ratios. If physical units may be chosen
such that the atomic parameters in equation (2) are constant, or close to it, then
preservation of the approximate numerical agreement of the ratios would require that
as the universe expands, and the expansion time t increases, the strength of the
gravitational interaction decreases, as

G ∼ t−1.

(3)
This would mean that the number of protons is increasing as np ∼ N 2 ∼ t2. Dirac
was not clear about the manner of increase of np; he mentioned particle production
in stellar interiors. The thought turned to the idea that np is the number of protons
in the observable part of the universe, which has been increasing (in the standard
cosmology and variants).

4.3 Mach, large numbers, the Weak and Strong Equivalence Principles, and
experimental tests

Dicke argued that Dirac likely was on the right, Machian, track: As the universe
evolves physical “constants” evolve under the inﬂuence of the evolving concentra-
tions of matter. But my observation was that Dicke was even more attracted to
ideas that suggested interesting experiments from which something of value might
be learned. At the Chapel Hill Conference Dicke (1957a) mentioned experiments in
progress motivated by the idea that Dirac’s LNH

would imply that the gravitational coupling constant varies with time. Hence
it might also well vary with position; hence gravitational energy might con-
tribute to weight in a diﬀerent way from other energy, and the principle of
equivalence might be violated, or at least be only approximately true. How-
ever, it is just at this point that the E¨otv¨os experiment is not accurate enough
to say anything; it says the strong interactions are all right (as regards the
principle of equivalence), but it is the weak interactions we are questioning.

. . .

Assuming that the gravitational binding energy of a body contributes anoma-
lously to its weight (e.g., does not contribute or contributes too much), a large
body would have a gravitational acceleration diﬀerent from that of a small
one. A ﬁrst possible eﬀect is the slight diﬀerence between the eﬀective weight
of an object when it is on the side of the earth toward the sun and when it is
on the side away from the sun.

The comment about a diﬀerence of gravitational accelerations of a large body
and a small one is worth noting. It may be related to Dicke’s (1962a) later remark:
If the strength of the gravitational interaction were a function of position, then the
gravitational binding energy of a massive body, such as the planet Jupiter, would be
a function of position, and the gradient of the energy would be a force that would
cause the orbit to diﬀer from that of a low mass particle with negligible gravitational
binding energy. Finzi (1962) discussed the same eﬀect, in connection with the orbits
of white dwarf stars. Nordtvedt (1968) introduced the formal analysis of the eﬀect.

The principle of equivalence Dicke mentioned at the Chapel Hill Conference has
come to be termed the Strong Equivalence Principle: the prediction in general rela-
tivity theory that what is happening on Earth is quite unaﬀected by the disposition

12

The European Physical Journal H

of all exterior mass, in our Solar System, galaxy, and the rest of the universe, apart
from tidal ﬁelds and the determination of local inertial motion. The Weak Equiva-
lence Principle is that the gravitational acceleration of a test particle is independent
of its nature. It is tested by the E¨otv¨os experiment, as Dicke noted. Early discussions
of the distinction are in Dicke (1957a; 1959b, pp. 3-4; 1962a, pp. 15-31).

The pendulum experiment Dicke mentioned at the Chapel Hill Conference, to
check for variation of the gravitational acceleration g at a ﬁxed point on Earth, was
a search for a possible violation of the Strong Principle. Maybe, Dicke suggested,
the strength G of gravity varies as the Earth moves around the Sun and moves
relative to the rest of the mass of the universe, producing an annual variation of
g, or maybe G is decreasing as the universe expands, producing a secular decrease
of g. At Chapel Hill Dicke also mentioned precision tracking of the motion of the
Moon. He did not explain, but in later papers stated the purpose to be to check for
Dirac’s LNH expressed in equation (3), again in violation of the Strong Principle.
Section 6.10.2 reviews how tracking the Moon grew into a demanding test of general
relativity with a tight constraint on the LNH, including the variation of g that the
pendulum experiments were meant to probe.

4.4 Large numbers and Scalar-Tensor Gravity

Pascual Jordan took Dirac’s LNH seriously (as Schucking 1999 described). Jordan
(1937, 1949) reviewed Eddington’s (1936) and Dirac’s (1937) considerations of the
large numbers and, with Dirac, contemplated the idea that np is growing because
matter is being created, maybe in stars. Jordan and M¨oller (1947) and Jordan (1948)
took the LNH as motivation for replacing Newton’s gravitational constant G by a
scalar ﬁeld in a scalar-tensor gravity theory in which the evolution of the scalar ﬁeld
could agree with the conjecture that the strength of the gravitational interaction is
decreasing as the universe expands. In his book, Schwerkraft und Weltall, Jordan
(1952) took note of Teller’s (1948) point, that a larger G in the past would imply
a hotter Sun, which if too hot would violate evidence of early life on Earth, a seri-
ous constraint. Also in Schwerkraft und Weltall, the setup of the scalar-tensor theory
required local violation of energy-momentum conservation if the strength of the grav-
itational interaction were evolving, again leading Jordan to contemplate generation of
matter (p. 143), perhaps in stars, perhaps causing the masses of stars to increase as
G decreases. In Schwerkraft und Weltall and Die Expansion der Erde (Jordan 1966)
Jordan considered the growing evidence for continental drift, which he pointed out
might be caused by a decreasing value of G that relieved stresses. In the preface to
Die Expansion der Erde, Jordan wrote that “I must report that R. Dicke has inde-
pendently arrived at similar hypothetical consequences” (as expressed in the English
translation in Jordan 1971). Jordan (1966) may have been referring to Dicke (1961a)
or (1962b), who discussed issues of continental drift.

Fierz (1956) wrote down the special case of Jordan’s approach to a scalar-tensor
theory that preserves standard local physics, eliminating the violation of local energy
conservation that Jordan was thinking might be relevant for stellar evolution. In the
notation of Brans and Dicke (1961), Fierz’s action (with units chosen so c = 1) is

(cid:90) √−g d4x(cid:2)φR + 16πL + w φ,iφ,i/φ(cid:3) .

S =

(4)

Newton’s gravitational constant G is replaced by φ−1, where φ is a scalar ﬁeld. Fierz’s
innovation was to remove φ from the action L for matter and radiation, allowing
standard local physics. The presence of φ in the denominator of the gradient energy

Will be inserted by the editor

13

density term makes the units consistent. The source term for φ in equation (4) is
w−1R, where the Ricci tensor R is a measure of spacetime curvature. Brans (1961)
showed that this can be reduced to

(cid:3) φ = 8πT /(3 + 2w),

(5)

where T is the trace of the matter stress-energy tensor. Thus we see that the coupling
of the scalar ﬁeld to the rest of physics is on the order of w−1, depending on whether
the coupling is related to R or T . The constant w is a free parameter. The larger w
the smaller the source of variation of φ, that is, at large w equation (4) may approach
the Einstein-Hilbert action of general relativity with constant φ and G = 1/φ.

Carl Brans (PhD Princeton 1961) arrived in Princeton in 1957 as a graduate stu-
dent intending to work on mathematical analyses of spacetime structure. He recalled
that Charles Misner (whose PhD in 1957 was directed by Wheeler) suggested that
he talk to Dicke, who was looking for someone to turn Mach’s Principle and Dirac’s
LNH into a gravity theory (Brans 2008; 2016). Dicke told Brans about Sciama’s
(1953) schematic model for how this might be done; Brans then independently hit on
the scalar-tensor action in equation (4), with preservation of local energy-momentum
conservation. He then learned that Jordan and Fierz had done it earlier.

In his ﬁrst publications on gravity physics Dicke (1957b, c) referred to Jordan
(1952) and Fierz (1956). If at the time Dicke had recognized the signiﬁcance of the
theory in these papers it would have been in character for him to have told Brans
about them rather than Sciama, but we can only speculate about this. In any case, we
see that Dicke’s references to Jordan’s research on scalar-tensor gravity theory and
its physical implications were complete, though brief. Jordan’s theory was cited in
Dicke (1957b, c); Brans and Dicke (1961) and Dicke (1962c), on their considerations
of the scalar-tensor theory; and in Dicke (1964) and Dicke and Goldenberg (1967),
on the search for a solar oblateness that might allow more room for the scalar-tensor
parameter w in equation (4). Jordan does not seem to have been overly troubled by
this manner of acknowledgement of his work, as indicated by their correspondence.3
In a letter to Dicke dated 2.7.1966 Jordan wrote

I tried to study comprehensively the whole ﬁeld of empirical facts which might
be suited to allow a test of Dirac’s hypothesis; and I have now the impression
(or I hope to be justiﬁed to think so) that all relevant empirical facts are in best
accord with theoretical expectation, and the whole picture is quite convincing.
I shall be very anxious, as soon as the book is published, to learn what you
think of it. (Some points are a little deviating from what you preferred to
assume; I come to the result of a rather great value of ˙κ/κ ∼ 10−9/ year . . . I
intend to be in USA for about a month . . . Naturally I should be extremely
glad to have the occasion to visit you.

Here ˙κ/κ is Jordan’s notation for the fractional rate of change of the strength of
˙G/G. Dicke’s reply, dated 7 July 1966, after a

I was pleased to learn that you are publishing a new book. I think that perhaps
you would agree with me that the implications for geophysics and astrophysics
of a time rate of change of the gravitational interaction is one of the most
fascinating questions that one could consider. I always have my mind open
looking for some new fragment of information that could have a bearing on
this question. I am curious to know how you could have a time rate of change

of gravitation as great as 10−9 per year and am looking forward to reading
about it in your book.

At the time we felt reasonably sure that the evolution of G could could not be faster
than about a tenth of Jordan’s value (Sec. 6.10). Jordan and Dicke disagreed about
aspects of the science, as here, but I know of no indication of disagreements between
the two beyond this normal course of events in research.

For a more complete review of the historical development of scalar-tensor theories
see Goenner (2012). For other reviews of Jordan’s and Dicke’s thinking about an
evolving G and its possible eﬀects in geophysics and cosmology see Kragh (2015a,b;
2016).

5 The Gravity Research Group

The experimental advances in gravity physics the 1950s and 1960s grew out of inde-
pendent work in many laboratories. But since Dicke was the central actor it is appro-
priate to give particular attention to his approach. The examples discussed here are
drawn from the projects he mentioned at the Chapel Hill Conference: a repetition of
the classical E¨otv¨os experiment and a search for possible variation of the gravitational
acceleration by a suitably designed pendulum experiment. This discussion is meant
to illustrate some of Dicke’s characteristic methods, including recollections of how he
assembled the Gravity Research Group.

5.1 The Princeton Static and Dynamic E¨otv¨os Experiments

The E¨otv¨os experiment tests a starting idea of general relativity, that the gravita-
tional acceleration of a test particle is independent of the nature of the particle.
Dicke’s (1957a) comments about the considerable advances in technology from what
was available to E¨otv¨os are illustrated in Figure 3. The photograph on the upper left
shows E¨otv¨os and colleagues, likely measuring gravitational ﬁeld gradients. He later
turned this methodology to the comparison of gravitational accelerations of a variety
of materials (E¨otv¨os, Pek´ar, and Fekete 1922, E¨otv¨os posthumously). To avoid dis-
turbing the instrument E¨otv¨os had to let the balance come to rest in isolation, then
approach it and promptly use the telescope for a visual observation of the orientation
of the balance before it could respond to the gravitational ﬁeld gradient produced by
the mass of his body. The line drawing on the right, which shows the setup of the
Princeton dynamic version, illustrates three of the improvements Dicke mentioned in
response to Bergmann’s question: the balance placed in a vacuum, to reduce dissi-
pation and the attendant Brownian noise; the behavior of the balance measured and
recorded remotely, removing disturbance by the observer; and the system buried to
reduce the disturbing eﬀects of temperature variations and the wind and the noise.
Dicke also chose to compare the gravitational accelerations of test masses toward the
Sun. The advantage was that a diﬀerence of accelerations toward the Sun would be
manifest as an eﬀect on the balance with a 24-hour period. That removed the need to
rotate the apparatus, apart from checks of reproducibility. But this strategy of course
required careful attention to diurnal disturbances.

The static version of the Princeton E¨otv¨os experiment employed a feedback loop
to hold a torsion balance in place; the dynamic version tracked the oscillation fre-
quency of a torsion pendulum. Dicke mentioned the static approach at the March
1957 Chapel Hill conference. In the fall of 1957 Sidney Liebes joined the Gravity
Research Group and Dicke suggested to him the dynamic version and the optical

Fig. 3. The photograph in the upper left shows E¨otv¨os and colleagues, likely measuring
gravitational ﬁeld gradients. On the right is an illustration of features common to the two
repetitions of the E¨otv¨os experiment in Dicke’s group: the balance placed in a vacuum, the
torque detected remotely, and the instrument buried. On the lower left is a sketch of the
torsion balance used in the static version (in an early design).

and Dicke 1964).

interferometer method of precision timing of the pendulum. He left it to Liebes to
design, construct, and operate the experiment.

In the dynamic version the torsion balance was a 2.5-cm long tubular bar of
fused silica with an aluminum test mass inserted in one end and a platinum mass
inserted in the other. The equilibrium position of the bar was oriented east-west. The
bar was suspended by a thin fused-silica ﬁber (which Liebes drew by the traditional

 16

The European Physical Journal H

crossbow technique). The amplitude of oscillation approached 90◦, the period was
approximately 8 minutes, and the decay constant in the high vacuum was several
months, which is about 104 oscillations. The apparatus was buried ﬁve feet beneath
the bleachers of the Princeton football stadium, to suppress diurnal temperature
variations. The upper end of the torsion ﬁber was attached to a gimbal mechanism
that enabled eddy current damping of pendulum vibrations induced by football games
and other disturbances.

The left-hand part of Figure 4 is a top view of the angle-sensitive optical inter-
ferometer Dicke proposed to Liebes. One element is an optical ﬂat on one side of the
pendulum. The beam-splitter (semi-reﬂective mirror) caused the nearly monochro-
matic light from a low-pressure sodium lamp to follow the opposing paths through the
interferometer marked by the solid and dashed lines. The emerging beams combined
to form an interference pattern, the output of which was integrated by a photomulti-
plier. The bar is shown slightly displaced from the interferometric null-fringe position.
In passage through optical null the fringes race apart and the photomultiplier detects
a momentary characteristic pulse of light. The pulse timings were measured with a
stabilized high-frequency oscillator and frequency counter system. A violation of the
Weak Equivalence Principle would be manifest as a 24-hour variation of the gravita-
tional torque on the pendulum by the Sun, which would produce a diurnal variation
in the times of optical null as the torsion pendulum crossed in one direction, and
an opposite shift in times of optical null when crossing in the other direction. This
experiment was reported at a conference (Liebes 1963), but not published.

The static version was buried in another then more remote part of the campus.
The sketch of the torsion balance on the lower left side of Figure 3 shows the fused
silica triangle that held the test masses, gold and aluminum, in an arrangement that
suppresses tidal torques. This triangle is drawn in heavy lines in the right-hand sketch
in Figure 4, showing the two feedback electrodes that straddled the gold test mass
(but straddled the aluminum mass in the earlier design in Fig. 3). Roll, Krotkov, and
Dicke (1964) described this part of the experiment as follows:

At the heart of the experiment is the instrumentation for measuring very small
rotations of the torsion balance . . . The light is focused through a 25 µ slit,
reﬂected from the aluminized ﬂat on the quartz frame of the torsion balance,
deﬂected oﬀ the telescope axis by a small prism, and the image of the slit
focused on a 25 µ-diam tungsten wire. By locating this wire in the ﬁeld of
a small magnet and connecting it in a balanced bridge oscillator circuit, it
was made to oscillate at its mechanical resonance frequency of about 3000 cps
and with an amplitude of 25 to 50 µ . . . When the diﬀraction pattern of the
25 µ slit produced by the 40 mm diameter telescope lens is centered exactly
on the equilibrium position of the oscillating wire . . . the photomultiplier will
detect only the even harmonics of the 3000 cps fundamental frequency. As the
torsion balance rotates slightly and shifts the diﬀraction pattern oﬀ center,
the fundamental frequency will begin to appear in the photomultiplier output.
The phase of the fundamental (0◦ or 180◦ relative to the oscillator signal
driving the wire) indicates the direction of rotation of the pendulum, and its
amplitude is proportional to the magnitude of the rotation for suﬃciently small
angular displacements . . . The full width at half maximum of this curve (the
“line width” which must be split by the detection apparatus) is about 30 µ or
3 × 10−5 rad . . . these processes are all performed by a lock-in ampliﬁer.
The experimental result is discussed in Section 6.7. Peter Roll (2016) recalls that,

in writing the paper on this experiment (Roll, Krotkov, and Dicke 1964),

it was important for the ﬁnal paper on the E¨otv¨os-Dicke experiment to doc-
ument it in enough detail so that subsequent generations would not have to

do as much legwork to understand exactly what was done and how. Dicke’s
contributions to the paper were the rationale for doing it in the ﬁrst place
and the basic design of the apparatus. Bob Krotkov got the ﬁrst versions of
the equipment designed in detail, built, and working. I came along at the end,
contributing some of details of the Au-Al-Al apparatus and procedures, the
ﬁnal analyses of data and error sources, and analysis of E¨otv¨os and Renner
results. Bob Dicke was the master of both the theory behind the experiments
and the experimental and apparatus design. His introduction to the 1964 paper
explains the years he spent looking for a scalar gravitational ﬁeld.

5.2 Searching for Variation of the Gravitational Acceleration

The pendulum experiment Dicke mentioned at Chapel Hill was meant to test whether
the gravitational acceleration at a ﬁxed spot on Earth may vary as the Earth moves
around the Sun, or as the universe expands, motivated by the ideas reviewed in
Section 4. Features that he mentioned are illustrated in Figure 5, in two diﬀerent
pendulum designs, the left-hand sketch from Bill Hoﬀmann’s (1962) dissertation and
the right-hand sketch from David Curott’s (1965) dissertation. The rapid oscillations
(22 Hz in Hoﬀmann’s experiment, 5 Hz for Curott) made these pendulums less sen-
sitive to external disturbances and much more sensitive to a slow variation of g,
because more oscillations were observed in a given time. Each was drawn from a sin-
gle piece of silica, with no knife edges that may wear, and very small energy loss in
the vacuum. The pendulums were electrostatically driven. The dissipation times were
about 6 hours for Hoﬀmann, 20 hours for Curott, or about 4× 105 oscillations in each
experiment. The period measurement during free decay used a source of light that
passed through a slit, was reﬂected oﬀ an optical ﬂat on the bottom of the pendu-
lum, and focused on the vertex of a prism. As the pendulum swung the light passed
from primary detection by a photomultiplier on one side of the prism to detection
by a photomultiplier on the other side. A frequency standard with good short-term

stability was phase-locked to the pendulum to follow the average pendulum crossing
time.

Dicke chose the designs for the two versions of the E¨otv¨os experiment, static
and dynamic, and the two versions of execution of the pendulum experiment. We
may suppose he meant to explore possibilities for optimum methods. Was the time
right for these exploratory experiments? Might they have been done much earlier?
Hoﬀmann’s (2016) response is

A small fused silica inverted pendulum could have been fabricated and op-
erated in a vacuum before the 1950’s. But the accuracy of the measurement
of the pendulum frequency depended on recent technological advances. These
included sensitive phototubes used to detect the light beam reﬂected from the
pendulum; low noise, stable, battery-operated vacuum tubes developed for un-
dersea communication cables and used with the phototubes; lock-in ampliﬁers
pioneered by Bob Dicke and used for precision phase locking and monitor-
ing weak signals; fast counters and digital printers; a commercial ultra-stable
crystal oscillator and a commercial atomic clock (General Radio Atomichron)
for precise timing; and a programable digital computer (IBM 650) for Fourier
analysis of the measurements to identify an annual variation. The experiment
was built at the time transistors were coming into use and beneﬁted by use of
this new technology.

. . .

The IBM 650 was purchased by Princeton and installed in the Gauss house, a
Victorian home on Nassau Street, around 1957-58. Prior to that Princeton had
limited use of the Institute for Advanced Study MANIAC computer. During
1960 I was given the keys to the building for a night and spent the night there
alone with with punched cards containing my data and a machine language
Fourier transform program written by Bob Krotkov. The result is in my thesis.
This would not have been possible two years earlier.

Curott (2015) expresses the same opinion and adds that his experiment

couldn’t have been done much earlier since it depended upon current (1960’s)
ultra-vacuum technology and electronic timing techniques. The emerging com-
puter availability on campus also played an important role since daily correc-
tions had to be made for minute by minute positions of moon and sun (tidal
corrections). The data analysis would have been daunting, if not impossible,
before electronic computers.

Dicke was the leading exponent of the method of synchronous lock-in ampliﬁer
detection employed in these pendulum experiments. He had used it earlier in the
Dicke (1946) microwave radiometer for suppression of the eﬀect of receiver noise by
switching between the source to be measured and a stable reference source, with
detection of the output synchronized to the switching frequency. In addition to the
static E¨otv¨os and the Hoﬀmann and Curott pendulum experiments, lock-in ampli-
ﬁers were used in the Gravity Group measurement of the solar gravitational redshift
(Sec. 6.4); the development of static gravimeters (Sec. 6.6); and the radiometer used
in the Princeton search for the CMB (Sec. 6.13.2). The ﬁrst commercial lock-in am-
pliﬁers were produced in 1962 by the then privately held company, Princeton Applied
Research, founded by Dicke and colleagues largely at Princeton University and the
Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. Curott (1965) acknowledged use of a “Pro-
totype of a model commercially available from Princeton Applied Research Corp.”
On the measurements of the shape of the Sun (Kuhn, Libbrecht, and Dicke 1988
and earlier references therein), Kuhn (2016) recalled that “Dicke’s solar oblateness
measurements both with Goldenberg and Hill, and later with Ken and I had, at

Will be inserted by the editor

19

their heart, at least one analog lock-in ampliﬁer. Even in the 80’s when we had early
microcomputers to do synchronous demodulation, Bob had a very clever scheme to
measure the position of the solar image in reference to the occulting disk using a ‘JB8’
lock-in ampliﬁer. It made the Mt. Wilson oblateness measurements possible.”4 The
judgement of experimental colleagues at Princeton University judge is that, with its
successors, the lock-in ampliﬁer “probably has contributed as much to experimental
PhD theses as any device of the past generation” (Happer, Peebles, and Wilkinson
1999).

5.3 Assembling the Gravity Research Group

How did Dicke assemble the Gravity Research Group group? Recollections of the ﬁve
main contributors to the pendulum and E¨otv¨os experiments oﬀer a fair sample.

David Curott: When I entered the graduate program I intended to go into
Controlled Fusion Research. I assumed there was no reason to question General
Relativity. Without my knowing about Dicke’s Group, in my ﬁrst summer I
was assigned a summer research assistantship in Dicke’s Gravity Group, and
that opened my eyes to the need for gravity research and the opportunities
oﬀered by new technologies. Dicke and his group excited my imagination and
I stayed in the Group.

Bill Hoﬀmann: I entered graduate school at Princeton in the fall of 1954,
after graduating from a small college (Bowdoin), intending to be a theoretical
physicist. I soon found that this was not for me, but I was not interested
in mainstream experimental work in atomic, nuclear, or high energy physics.
When I ﬁrst met Bob Dicke on his return from Harvard sabbatical in 1955 he
was all ﬁred up about gravity experiments. His enthusiasm and ideas about
gravitation experimentation captivated me. I knew that this was the person I
wanted to work with. I was attracted by the challenges to be inventive and the
stimulation from others in his group.

Robert Krotkov: I joined Dicke’s group because he invited me. I don’t remem-
ber just what research I did at ﬁrst — but I do remember where we ﬁrst talked.
It was in Palmer lab. As one came in the front door there was a hallway to the
right, a hallway to the left, and straight ahead stairs leading up to a landing. It
was on that landing that we happened to meet each other. How one remembers
the really important things! Eugene Wigner directed my PhD. With Wigner,
I would carry out some calculations, come to him, and he would tell me what
to do next. With Dicke, I got a big picture and saw where what we were doing
would ﬁt in.

Sidney Liebes: I’ve had a lifelong fascination with relativity, ﬁrst kindled, in
my youth, by reading George Gamow’s Mr. Tomkins in Wonderland. Nearing
completion of my PhD experiment at Stanford, testing a prediction of quan-
tum electrodynamics, I asked George Pake whether he knew anyone doing
experimental gravity physics. George’s response: “Bob Dicke at Princeton.”
That prompted my phone call to Dicke, which resulted in an oﬀer to join the
faculty as an instructor and work in the Gravity Research Group. Dicke cre-
ated an environment where I felt totally uninhibited in how I spent my time,
never prompted, directed or monitored, beyond periodic Group meeting up-
date contributions. I believe that environment to have been a critical factor in
my independent rediscovery of gravitational lensing.

The European Physical Journal H

Peter Roll: My ﬁrst introduction to general relativity and gravitation was a
summer reading assignment of Ernst Mach’s book on Mechanics, and several
“wasted” hours in the Yale Physics Library digesting a small textbook on ten-
sor calculus and GR, when I should have been working on physics problems
and papers. In the spring of 1960 I was completing my PhD dissertation in
experimental nuclear physics at Yale and looking for a job. Bob Beringer, a
senior faculty member at Yale and a colleague of Bob Dicke at the MIT Ra-
diation Lab during the war, had just learned that Dicke was looking for a
newly-minted PhD to join his group at Princeton, ﬁnishing the E¨otv¨os exper-
iment that Bob Krotkov had started. Beringer encouraged me to look into the
position and told me a bit about Dicke’s background and accomplishments.
After a telephone call and a trip to Princeton, my mind was made up — I
wasn’t going to ﬁnd another position or another place that was anywhere near
as interesting and challenging.

I might add that in the early 1960s, while I was attending Gravity Research Group
meetings, I still had in mind writing a dissertation in theoretical elementary particle
physics. But Bob had suggested that I look into constraints on possible evolution of
the ﬁne-structure constant from the degree of consistency of radioactive decay ages
based on diﬀerent long-lived atomic nuclei. That got me interested in the rhenium-
osmium decay,

187Re →187 Os + e− + ¯ν,

(6)

because I had noticed that the quite small decay energy made the decay rate quite
sensitive to a change of the ﬁne-structure constant. Since the decay energy was not
well known I started looking into how I might better measure it. But Dicke had come
to know me well enough to instruct me, ﬁrst that I ought to stick with theory, and
second that I am better suited to the kind of theory we had been doing in his group.
To exemplify the diverse directions of research in the group I refer to the list
of reports of work in the Gravity Research Group at the January 1963 meeting of
the American Physical Society:5 Dicke on Mach’s Principle and Laboratory Physics;
Brault on Gravitational Red Shift of Solar Lines; Liebes on Test of the Principle
of Equivalence; Turner and Hill on New Experimental Limit on Velocity-Dependent
Interactions of Clocks and Distant Matter; Peebles on Experimental Restrictions on
Generally Covariant Gravity Theories; Faller on Absolute Determination of the Grav-
itational Acceleration; Hoﬀmann on Pendulum Gravimeter for Monitoring the Grav-
itational Acceleration as a Function of Time; and Roll and Dicke on Equivalence of
Inertial and Passive Gravitational Mass. By the time of this meeting other groups
were making important contributions to experimental gravity physics, as reviewed in
the next section, but none rivaled this searching range of investigations.

6 Experimental Gravity Physics

By experiments in gravity physics I mean to include what astronomers term observa-
tions, and also probes of gravity physics derived from measurements made for other
purposes. I mention PhD theses completed in the course of research aimed at probing
gravity, because students made considerable contributions, particularly so in Dicke’s
Gravity Research Group. (It’s worth recalling that Dicke’s group often met on Friday
evenings; we complained but attended because the discussions were too interesting to
miss.) This review of how the subject grew is largely assembled from the published
literature, but I refer to personal recollections from some of the actors, many of them

Dicke’s students and colleagues, as well as my own experience since arriving at Prince-
ton as a graduate student in 1958 and joining the group soon after that. It should be
understood that the sparse references to what happened after 1968, as experimental
research in this subject became normal science, are meant only to illustrate what
grew out of the naissance. Also, as a theorist, I am aware that a better-informed
examination of experimental methods, and how they evolved during the naissance,
would be a valuable addition to these summary comments.

6.1 A Timeline for Experimental Gravity Physics

The timeline in Figure 6 summarizes experimental developments in gravity physics
from 1915 to the nominal completion of the naissance. The choice of developments
to be marked required some creative accounting. The orbit of Mercury was the only
demanding test of general relativity for a long time, so it ought to be marked; I put
it at Einstein’s 1915 relativistic interpretation of the excess precession (line 1 in the
ﬁgure). I stretch the decade of the naissance to admit the Shapiro, Pettengill, Ash,
et al. (1968) measurement of the relativistic time delay of planetary radar pulses
that pass near the Sun (line 38 in the ﬁgure). I mark a few developments that were
initiated during the naissance and later became important tests. Thus line 22 marks
Schiﬀ’s (1960) argument for a gyroscope experiment to test the relativistic dragging
of inertial frames (Sec. 6.8), which led to Gravity Probe B (Everitt et al. 2015). The
1965 argument by the Dicke Group for a Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment (Alley,
Bender, Dicke, et al. 1965; line 32 in the ﬁgure) is marked because it was an early step
toward an extraordinarily demanding program of tests of gravity physics (Sec. 6.10.2).
Zel’dovich’s (1968, line 37) discussion of the quantum ﬁeld zero-point contribution to
the vacuum energy density is marked because, though little recognized then, it was
and remains a major challenge for gravity and quantum physics.

Zwicky (1933) showed that, under conventional physics, the stability of the Coma
cluster of galaxies requires “dunkle Materie” considerably in excess of what is seen in
the stars (line 9 in Fig. 6). The problem was noted by others; an example is Babcock’s
(1939) demonstration that the gaseous nebulae on the outskirts of the galaxy M31
are moving relative to the galaxy much more rapidly than would be expected from
the observed mass of the stars. This and other evidence for dark matter was neglected
during the 1960s, but it was so very important to the aftermath (as brieﬂy reviewed
in Sec. 6.13.3) that it is marked in the ﬁgure, at Zwicky’s paper.

Line 11 marks another of Zwicky’s (1937) contributions, his discussion of how a
galaxy could act as a gravitational lens. It is entered because it was the ﬁrst informed
recognition of a possibly observable eﬀect, though Zwicky’s paper was little noticed
until a reference to it appeared in broader analyses of gravitational lensing eﬀects by
Klimov (1963), Refsdal (1964), who cited Einstein’s (1936) paper, and Liebes (1964),
who cited Einstein (1936) and Zwicky (1937), while Zwicky in turn cited Einstein
(1936). This is discussed in Section 6.5.

Jocelyn Bell Burnell found the pulsar phenomenon in 1967. This produced the
ﬁrst observational evidence for the existence of neutron stars, as pulsars (Gold 1968
and references therein). Pulsars are not marked in the timeline because their potential
for demanding tests of gravity physics was seen only with the discovery of the Hulse
and Taylor (1975) binary pulsar.

The paper on relativistic collapse by Oppenheimer and Snyder (1939) is important,
but not marked because this theory had little to do with the evolving empirical
situation in the 1960s. The evidence for the presence of supermassive black holes (or
compact objects that act like them) in galactic nuclei was developing at this time.
An early step was Burbidge’s (1959) estimate of the energy in plasma in the radio

sources in the most luminous radio galaxies, about 1060 ergs. This is equivalent to the
annihilation of about 106 M(cid:12), which seemed excessive for energy production in stars.
Schmidt’s (1963) discovery of quasars added another energy problem, the source of the
large optical luminosities of these compact objects. This forced community attention
to the issues of gravitational collapse and black hole physics, as seen in the title of
the 1963 Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics: Quasistellar Sources and
Gravitational Collapse (Robinson, Schild, and Schucking 1965). Lynden-Bell (1969)
reviewed the proposal that the energy source for quasars and luminous radio galaxies
is relativistic collapse to a massive black hole, and he argued that black holes remnant
from quasar activity may be present in the nuclei of normal galaxies. This is now the
paradigm. The discovery of quasars is entered in the timeline (line 29 in Fig. 6) to
mark its eﬀect on thinking about gravitational collapse.

The evidence for stellar mass black holes traces from the discovery of Cygnus X-1
as an X-ray source (Bowyer, Byram, Chubb, and Friedman 1965), and the evidence
from optical identiﬁcation that it is a binary system with a main sequence primary
star and a companion X-ray source with mass at least 3 M(cid:12) (Webster and Murdin
1972; Bolton 1972). That plausibly meant that the companion is too massive to be
anything but a black hole. But the companion mass depends on an estimate of the
mass of the primary, which depends on its distance, which was uncertain. The evidence
now is that Cygnus X-1 contains a stellar remnant black hole with mass 15 ± 1 M(cid:12)
(Orosz, McClintock, Aufdenberg, et al. 2011). Although the stellar mass black hole
phenomenon is now well established, and Cygnus X-1 was discovered in 1965, the
evidence for stellar mass black holes developed late enough not to be marked in the
timeline.

Incremental experimental advances in gravity physics are not marked. Thus the
ﬁrst measurement of the gravitational deﬂection of light passing close to the Sun
(Dyson, Eddington, and Davidson 1920), is shown (line 3), but not the several repe-
titions, though as Trumpler (1956) emphasized they were very important in making
the case that the solar deﬂection likely had been detected and is within about 10%
of the predicted value. Trumpler reported that two white dwarf stars have measured
redshifts consistent with predicted gravitational redshifts. The theory and observa-
tion for one of the white dwarfs are within 15% of present measurements, and they
are consistent with general relativity. But the measured and predicted redshifts of
the other white dwarf, although consistent with each other, both are one quarter of
present results. Section 6.4 reviews this situation. For the timeline it seems to be
more appropriate to mark St. John’s (1928) case for detection of the gravitational
redshift of light from the Sun (line 6 in Fig. 6). Although turbulent motions caused
the measured redshift to vary across the face of the Sun, and to vary with atomic
weight, the measurements generally were within about 30% of the prediction. I also
mark Brault’s (1962) solar redshift measurement (in line 24) because his strategy of
solar line choice, and his much improved ability to measure the line shape and line
center, successfully suppressed the systematic variation across the face of the Sun,
which considerably improved the case for detection of the gravitational eﬀect. The
Pound and Rebka (1960) laboratory detection of the gravitational redshift is marked
too (in line 19), because although its formal uncertainty was about twice Brault’s the
hazards of systematic errors in the two measurements were quite diﬀerent. The consis-
tency makes a very good case that the gravitational redshift eﬀect really was detected
by 1962, and determined to be within about 10% of the relativistic prediction.

The following review of gravity experiments oﬀers still more explanations of this
timeline. Will’s (1993) analysis of experimental developments presented a timeline
running from 1960 to 1980, in a useful complement to Figure 6. Another’s selection
of entries for Figure 6 certainly could diﬀer, but we may be sure it would show the

24

strikingly abrupt change in density of entries in the late 1950s, at the naissance, which
is the point of this paper.

6.2 Tests for preferred motion

The experiments reviewed in this subsection test whether the time kept by a local
clock, such as transitions in a molecule, or atom, or atomic nucleus, or the behavior of
electromagnetic ﬁelds, might be aﬀected by position or motion, in a violation of the
Strong Equivalence Principle that would have to be more subtle than the Galilean
transformation that was ruled out by the demonstration that the velocity of light
is close to isotropic. Some of these experiments were motivated by thoughts of an
aether, others by the Machian thoughts discussed in Section 4 that the disposition
and motion of all of the matter in the universe might deﬁne a preferred position or
motion manifest in local physics.

The results of measurements summarized in Table 1 are expressed as bounds on
a parameter  that is meant to be a measure of coupling to an eﬀective aether. For
deﬁniteness I take the velocity v of our motion through the aether to be comparable
to our velocity relative to the thermal 3K Cosmic Microwave Background (the CMB
discussed in Sec. 6.13.2),

v (cid:39) 300 km s

−1.

(7)

The deﬁnition of  has to be ad hoc, of course, because our motion through an eﬀective
aether need not be comparable to our motion through the CMB, and, more important,
we do not have a viable theory of .

The ﬁrst entry in the table, from before the start of the timeline, is the Michelson-
Morley bound on the anisotropy of the velocity of light,6 which in a Galilean trans-

formation bounds the eﬀective motion relative to the aether to ve

concluded that “The theory may still be said to be in an unsatisfactory condition.”

with v in equation (7). This implies the Michelson-Morley bound,  <∼ 0.01, entered
in the last column of the ﬁrst line of the table.

Jaseja, Javan, Murray, and Townes (1964) compared frequencies of two neon-
helium masers (in which helium pumps population inversion for neon emission lines
at wavelength ∼ 104˚A) placed in orthogonal directions on a platform that can rotate.
The stimulated emission frequency is deﬁned by the mirror separation, so the Galilean
argument for the Michelson-Morley experiment applies here: the relative frequency
diﬀerence is expected to be δν/ν = 1
2 (ve/c)2 cos θ, by the Galilean argument. The
bound, δν/ν <∼ 10−11, on the eﬀect of rotation of the system, so as to point it in
<∼ 1 km s−1, a factor of three
diﬀerent directions relative to an aether drift, indicates ve
better than Michelson-Morley. The older method did so well with a much more poorly
deﬁned frequency because the same wave, or photon, sampled the path diﬀerence.

The second entry in the table is Chase’s (1926) revisit of a pre-relativity expression
for the magnetic ﬁeld B induced by uniform motion of a charge distribution at velocity
v relative to the aether. A Galilean transformation of a static charge distribution and
electric ﬁeld produces magnetic ﬁeld

B =  v × E/c.

(9)

With  = 1 these electric and magnetic ﬁelds are a solution to Maxwell’s equations.7
We know now that this solution does not represent a static situation, of course, but
the constant  in equation (9) allows a measure of the possible coupling of the local
electromagnetic ﬁeld to Chase’s eﬀective “stationary ether” determined by the rest
of the matter in the universe. Equation (9) would indicate that a charged capacitor
moving at velocity v relative to the aether induces a magnetic ﬁeld whose energy
depends on the angle between E and v, producing a torque to minimize the energy.
Electromagnetic energies are large enough that Chase’s torsion balance yielded an
impressively tight constraint: the velocity of the experimental apparatus relative to
the local “stationary ether” has to be u <∼ 4 km s−1 if  = 1. Motion relative the
“stationary ether” at the CMB velocity in equation (7) gives the bound on  in
the last column of the table. The ﬁrst column is the line number in the timeline in
Figure 6.

Kennedy and Thorndike (1932) sought to complete the argument for special rela-
tivity from the Michelson-Morley experiment by testing whether the time kept by a
source of light for an optical interferometer might vary with the motion of the source
relative to some preferred frame (while the interferometer arm lengths might be un-
changed, or perhaps change in some other way). Their interferometer with unequal
arm lengths could then show a variation of the interference pattern as the motion of
the light source changed. The frequency of the light source as a function of velocity
w of the mercury atoms relative to an eﬀective aether mat be modeled as

ν = νo(1 ±  w2/c2),

w = u + v,

(10)

where u is the circumferential velocity of the interferometer due to the rotation of
the Earth, v is the velocity of the Earth relative to the aether, and the parameter 
replaces the factor 1/2 in the Kennedy-Thorndike model (their eq. [5]). The diurnal

where φ is the angle between the two vectors (with the sign in eq. [10] absorbed in φ),
and the terms that are nearly isotropic for purpose of the diurnal measurement are
ignored. It is worth pausing to consider the numbers entering their result. The light
was the spectral line of atomic mercury at wavelength λ = 5461 ˚A. The diﬀerence
of path lengths in the two arms was ∆s ∼ 30 cm, which translates to n = ∆s/λ (cid:39)
6 × 105 wavelengths. The measured bound on the diurnal fringe shift was δn <
6 × 10−5, which gives δn/n <∼ 10−10. We are considering the model δn/n = δν/ν.
The circumferential (Earth rotation) speed is u ∼ 0.3 km s−1. These numbers in
equation (11), more carefully used, give the Kennedy-Thorndike bound on the velocity
of the Earth relative to the aether, v < (24 ± 19)/ km s−1. With the adopted Earth
velocity (eq. [7]) this translates to the bound on  in the third line in the table. It
depends on the impressively tight bound on the fringe shift δn/n.

Ives and Stilwell (1938) tested the second-order transverse Doppler shift in a beam
of hydrogen consisting largely of the molecular hydrogen ion H+
2 and the heavier ion
with three protons bound by two electrons. They measuring the longitudinal and
transverse shifts in the analog of the Hβ line in the molecules at λ ∼ 5000 ˚A. The
measured transverse Doppler shifts in beams moving in the North, South, East or
West directions, were found to diﬀerer by no more than about ∆λ ∼ 0.003 ˚A. This
bounds the fractional shifts in times kept by the ions to ∆ν/ν <∼ 10−6, for ions moving
at beam velocities u ∼ 103 km s−1. The bound on  from equation (11) is entered in
the fourth row in the table. Recent precision tests of the relativistic Doppler eﬀect
by variants of the Ives and Stilwell experiment considerably improve this bound.
Botermann, Bing, Geppert, et al. (2014) reported that measurements of frequency
shifts of hyperﬁne structure lines of Li+ ions moving at speed w/c = 0.3 agree with
the relativistic prediction to a few parts in 109. Since they do not report problems
with reproduceability as the Earth rotates and moves around the Sun we may take
it that their bound in equation (10) bounds the coupling parameter to  <∼ 10−8 for
the hyperﬁne structure lines.

Cedarholm, Bland, Havens, and Townes (1958) used ammonia beam masers for an
aether drift test based on Møller’s (1956, 1957) considerations of how atomic clocks
might test relativity. The experiment compared the frequencies of two masers with
ammonia beams that moved in opposite (antiparallel) directions at beam velocity
u (cid:39) 0.6 km s−1. The fractional change of frequency when the system was rotated by
180◦ was bounded to ∆ν/ν <∼ 10−12, in trials repeated for a year (Cedarholm and
Townes 1959). Møller (1957) and Cedarholm et al. (1958) argued for the expression
in equation (11), without the parameter , from a consideration of the Doppler eﬀect
on radiation reﬂected by the walls of a resonant cavity moving through an eﬀective
aether. But it seems best to follow Turner and Hill (1964) in going directly to the
model in equation (11), including , as a ﬁtting function, where the bound on ∆ν/ν
translates to the bound on  entered in the ﬁfth row of the table

Cocconi and Salpeter (1958) wrote that, “If Mach’s Principle holds, we might
then expect that the slight asymmetries in the distribution of matter at large would
result in slight deviations from at least some of the laws of mechanics and gravitation
which are commonly assumed to be exact,” and could produce a “diurnal variation in
the period of a quartz crystal (or a pendulum) clock.” They did not refer to similar
arguments by Sciama (1953) and Dicke (1957b), or the pendulum experiment Dicke
(1957a) mentioned at Chapel Hill, but it is easy to imagine Cocconi and Salpeter were
thinking along the lines of one of the many other trails of thought tracing back to
Mach’s arguments. They went on to consider the possibility that the electron inertial
mass is slightly diﬀerent for motions transverse and parallel to a preferred direction
set by the large-scale distribution of matter, and pointed out that an inertial mass
anisotropy would cause the Zeeman splittings between atomic levels with neighboring
magnetic quantum numbers, m, to diﬀer, depending on the orientation of the magnetic

ﬁeld relative to some preferred direction, because the patterns of electron motions
relative to the magnetic ﬁeld diﬀer for diﬀerent values of m. Cocconi and Salpeter
(1960) suggested that the test could be even more sensitive if the Zeeman splittings
were probed by the M¨ossbauer (1958) eﬀect. Hughes, Robinson, and Beltran-Lopez
(1960), Drever (1960, 1961), and Virgilio Beltran-Lopez (1962, PhD Yale) turned to
a still more sensitive test by nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of Zeeman
splittings of the four levels of the I = 3/2 spin of the atomic nucleus of Li7. In a
simple model of a P3/2 neutron in the potential well of the six inner nucleons, the
constraint on anisotropy of the nucleon inertial mass was found to be δm/m < 10−20.
This impressed Dicke; it is the subject of my ﬁrst paper with him (Peebles and Dicke
1962a). In the model for δm/m expressed in the form of equation (10), with the
nucleon velocity approaching a few percent of the velocity of light, the bound on
coupling to an eﬀective aether is in the ﬁfth row in Table 1.

Two groups independently tested for preferred motion using M¨ossbauer’s (1958)
discovery and explanation of the very narrow nuclear γ-ray absorption line spectrum
produced when the recoil momenta of the nucleus emitter and absorber are taken
up by the crystal lattices rather than by the atomic nuclei. In the report of their
experiment, Champeney, Isaak, and Khan (1963) referred to Ruderfer (1960), who
proposed placing the γ-ray source at the center of a turntable and the M¨ossbauer
absorber near the edge. The origin of the other experiment, at Princeton, may be
traced back to a November 1959 letter from Dicke to Pound. Pound (2000) recalled
that Dicke wrote

I note from your recent note in the Physical Review Letters that we have been
inadvertently treading on each others research. For the past couple of months
Ken Turner has been working full time on the very problem you discuss.

The problem Dicke mentioned in this letter was a laboratory detection of the grav-
itational redshift by means of the M¨ossbauer eﬀect. Pound recalled that Dicke had
considered using a silver isotope that Pound and colleagues, with more experience in
condensed matter, felt was not likely to produce a usefully strong absorption line, and
that Dicke sent his graduate student, Ken Turner, to Pound to learn the technology.
Dicke (1963 p. 187) recalled that

It started out about September 1959 as an attempt to measure the gravita-
tional red shift using the M¨ossbauer eﬀect which had just been discovered, but
it soon became apparent that there were two other groups working on this
problem, and to avoid a horse race it was dropped about November in favor
of the one to be described.

The experiment “to be described” was by Kenneth Turner (1962, PhD Princeton).
Champeney et al. and Turner both used a Co57 γ-ray source and Fe57 absorber.
Turner placed the source near the rim of a standard centrifuge wheel and the absorber
and detector near the axis. The conclusions from the two experiments are that our
eﬀective velocity in Earth’s equatorial plane relative to the eﬀective aether is limited
to v = 160 ± 280 cm s−1 (Champeney et al. 1963) and v = 220 ± 840 cm s−1
(Turner and Hill 1964). These results in the model in equation (8) are summarized
in the seventh row in the table.

Dicke’s interest in the idea that gravity may be aﬀected by motion relative to a
preferred frame led to the experiment he mentioned at the 1957 Chapel Hill Confer-
ence (and is discussed in Sec. 5), to check whether the gravitational acceleration g at
a ﬁxed position on Earth might vary as the Earth moves around the Sun or as the
universe expands. This was the subject of the doctoral dissertation experiments by
William Hoﬀmann (1962, PhD Princeton) and David Curott (1965, PhD Princeton).
Hoﬀmann concluded “that the amplitude of any annual variation of the gravitational

28

The European Physical Journal H

constant, is less than 4 parts in 108,” which is comparable to what may be inferred
from other g measurements and “has considerable promise for accurate g measure-
ments.” Curott reported “a frequency increase of 1.7 ± .4 parts in 109 per day,” but
this tentative indication of a detection did not pass later tests. The ﬁtting function in
equation (11), expressed as the fractional variation of G as the Earth moves around
the Sun with speed u = 30 km s−1, with a conservative constraint from these two
experiments, δG/G <∼ 10−7.5, limits the parameter  in equation (11) to the value in
the eighth row in the table.

We see from the number of entries in Table 1, which is meant to be fair sample,
and the span of dates of the experiments, that the search for tests of special relativity,
or the idea of some sort of eﬀective aether, or the Machian considerations in Section 4,
or the elegance of some other holistic world picture that would relate local to global
physics, was interesting enough to enough people to motivate many experimental
examinations. They have not revealed any departure from the Strong Equivalence
Principle. This consideration continues in Section 7.1, following discussions of other
probes of the Strong Principle.

6.3 Time Kept by Accelerating Clocks

The time kept by an accelerated molecule, atom, or atomic nucleus may be aﬀected
by mechanical stresses that distort local wave functions and electromagnetic ﬁelds,
but within broadly accepted ideas these mechanical eﬀects may be computed, or
estimated, using standard atomic or condensed matter physics, even when one is con-
sidering the possibility that the physical parameters in the computation may depend
on position or on velocity relative to some aether. But tests for an intrinsic eﬀect
of acceleration on timekeeping must be considered. Rutherford and Compton (1919)
brieﬂy reported the test entered in line 2 of the timeline in Figure 6: they found no
eﬀect on the rate of decay of radioactive material ﬁxed to the edge of a spinning
disk. Ageno and Amaldi (1966) presented an edifying review of improvements of this
experiment, including their own version. The timeline marks (in line 20) the great
advance in sensitivity aﬀorded by the M¨ossbauer (1958) eﬀect in the centrifuge ex-
periment by Hay, Schiﬀer, Cranshaw, and Egelstaﬀ (1960). The setup was similar
to the anisotropy tests (Turner 1962; Champeney et al. 1963), except that Hay et
al. tested the mean transverse Doppler eﬀect. The measured fractional second-order
Doppler shift, δν/ν ∼ 10−13, was found to agree reasonably well with the relativis-
tic v2/2c2 prediction. This means the fractional shift in the intrinsic atomic nucleus
clock rate due to its acceleration must be well below a few parts in 1013 at the largest
experimental acceleration, 6× 107 cm s−2. The characteristic relativistic acceleration,
c2/r ∼ 1033 cm s−2, deﬁned by the radius r of the nucleus is much larger, however.

6.4 Gravitational Redshift, Relativistic Timing, and Tired Light

Trumpler (1956) mentioned the test of gravitational redshift in two white dwarf stars
(in multiple systems, so that the radial velocities of the companions yield the correc-
tion for the motions of the systems). He reported that the observed and predicted
redshifts of Sirius B are vobs = 19 km s−1 and vpred = 20 km s−1. This was without
attribution, but Adams (1925) and Moore (1928) both measured vobs = 21 km s−1,
close to Trumpler’s number. These two measurements were meant to be independent:
Adams used the 100-inch reﬂector at Mount Wilson, Moore the 36-inch refractor at
Mount Hamilton, which might be expected to be diﬀerently aﬀected by light scattered
from the main sequence companion star Sirius A. Both referred to Eddington for the

Will be inserted by the editor

29

prediction, vpred = 20 km s−1, which apparently was satisfactorily close to the two
measurements. But Greenstein, Oke, and Shipman (1971) argued that the Adams
and Moore

spectra were badly contaminated by Sirius A light, and the results depended
on measurements of metallic lines, such as the Mg II line λ4481, which are
now known not to occur in white dwarfs. Consequently, these redshifts are of
historical interest only.

Greenstein, Oke, and Shipman, in observations when Sirius A had moved further
away from the white dwarf Sirius B, reducing the problem with scattered light, found
vobs = 89 ± 16 km s−1 and vpred = 83 ± 3 km s−1. (The measurements for Sirius B
have not changed much since then: Barstow, Bond, Holberg, et al. 2005.) We see that
in the 1950s the two measurements of the redshift of Sirius B were consistent, but
wrong by a factor of four. They apparently conﬁrmed the relativistic prediction, but
it was wrong by a like factor. Hetherington (1980) and Greenstein, Oke, and Shipman
(1985) debated the meaning of this interesting situation.
The second white dwarf star Trumpler mentioned is 40 Eridani B, for which Popper
(1954) found vobs = 21± 4 km s−1 and vpred = 17± 3 km s−1. Greenstein and Trimble
(1972), making use of the developing art of image intensiﬁers, found vobs = 23 ±
5 km s−1 and vpred = 20 ± 9 km s−1 for 40 Eridani B, consistent with Popper. These
numbers agree with the relativistic prediction, and have not changed much since then.
Trumpler (1956) remarked that “For more than 30 years I have been working
on a program of measuring the radial velocities (Doppler shifts) of stars in galactic
star clusters.” This well-experienced observer did not pause to consider whether the
observations of the radial velocities of the two white dwarf stars might be questionable.
This is not a criticism of Trumpler, but rather a serious cautionary example of the
hazards of empirical science. This discussion continues in Section 7.7.

The other early test of the gravitational redshift, St. John’s (1928) measurements
of the redshift of light from the Sun, was vexed by turbulence and outﬂows manifest
as distortions of absorption line shapes, variations of the measured line shifts from
center to limb of the Sun, and systematic variations of the line shifts with the binding
energy of the ion, which correlates with the depth of formation of the line in the Solar
atmosphere. But the values of the line shifts were roughly in accord with relativity,
usually to about 30%, arguably good enough to be entered in Figure 6 (line 6), but
not a very convincing detection.

James Brault (1962, PhD Princeton), at Dicke’s suggestion, improved the situ-
ation. Brault measured the shift of the solar sodium D1 absorption line at 5896 ˚A,
which is strong enough to allow a tight measure of the line shape. And the sodium
ionization potential is small enough that the line is thought to largely originate above
the turbulence in the photosphere but below the chromosphere, in a region where non-
gravitational perturbations might be expected to be minimal. Brault used a wave-
length modulation technique that he showed stably deﬁned the line center, as follows.
The position of the output slit of the spectrometer oscillated at frequency ω, so that
the narrow band of wavelengths admitted to the photodetector varied with time as

λ(t) = λo + δλ sin ωt.

(12)

The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side, λo, was adjusted until the photodetector output
showed no component at the slit oscillation frequency ω, only the harmonics. The
value of λo at this point deﬁned a measure of the line center. (This strategy will be
recognized as similar to the phase-sensitive lock-in ampliﬁer technique used in the
Roll, Krotkov, and Dicke 1964 E¨ot¨vos experiment reviewed in Sec. 5.) The line shape
was probed by measuring how λo depended on the scan amplitude δλ in equation (12).
Brault demonstrated that, in his chosen line and range of scan amplitudes, λo is

30

insensitive to δλ. This is a signature of a satisfactorily symmetric line shape. He also
showed that the line center deﬁned this way is insensitive to position on the Sun,
scanning from center to limb. These two results make a reasonable case that the
measurements were not seriously aﬀected by nongravitational disturbances. Brault’s
conclusion was that “The ratio of the observed red shift to the theoretical value is
found to be 1.05 ± 0.05.”

This beautiful experiment was fully published only in Brault’s thesis. Dicke (1963,
pp. 189 – 191) outlined the experiment, and I take the liberty of showing in Figure 7
Brault’s (1962) summary ﬁgure. The horizontal axis is the amplitude δλ of the spec-
trum scan. The vertical axis shows the measured line shifts at solar center and limb;
other ﬁgures in the thesis showed samples across the full face of the Sun. The ﬁgure
shows the insensitivity to scan amplitude and position on the Sun that make the case
for a reliable test of the relativistic prediction marked by the dashed line.

Pound and Rebka (1960) used M¨ossbauer’s (1958) eﬀect to obtain a 10% labo-
ratory detection of the gravitational redshift of γ-rays falling 23 m through helium
in a tower at Harvard. The precision was comparable to Brault’s, but the situation
was very diﬀerent, which is important in the search for systematic errors, and the
laboratory experiment was under much better control and capable of improvement.
Pound and Snider (1964) brought the laboratory precision to 1%.

An even more demanding test of the gravitational redshift and relativistic time-
keeping grew out of another great advance in technology, atomic clocks. Møller’s
(1957) early recognition of their promise is discussed in Section 2. At the Chapel Hill
Conference Dicke (1957a) mentioned work at Princeton on rubidium atomic clocks,
in collaboration with Carroll Alley (1962, PhD Princeton). After considerably more

31

development (Mark Goldenberg 1960, PhD Harvard), Vessot et al. (1980) reported a
test of gravitational timekeeping by the Gravity Probe A rocket ﬂight of an atomic
hydrogen maser to 10,000 km altitude. The timing measurements agreed with the
prediction of general relativity theory to about a part in 104.

Shapiro’s (1964) “fourth test of general relativity,” which probes another aspect
of relativistic timing, used planetary radar astronomy (as reviewed in Pettengill and
Shapiro 1965) to check the relativistic prediction of an increase in return times of
radar pulses reﬂected by Mercury or Venus when the line of sight passes close to the
Sun. Shapiro (2015) recalled that

My “entry” into testing GR was not inﬂuenced as far as I could tell by Bob’s
broad and well broadcast - in scientiﬁc meetings and the like - approach to
(re)start this experimental ﬁeld. I didn’t attend any of these meetings, nor did
I read any of the proceedings. I had the idea to enter it from the prospects
for radar astronomy and my knowledge of the Mercury test; my ﬁrst thought,
in the late 1950s, was to check on, and improve, the measurements of the
relativistic advances of the perihelia of the inner planets. From there I went on
to think of more than a half dozen diﬀerent tests, almost all not original with
me, save for the radar/radio approach. All but two of them were eventually
carried out by my colleagues, students, and me, and also by others.

Shapiro, Pettengill, Ash, et al. (1968) termed their radar timing measurements “pre-
liminary,” but they presented a clear detection of the relativistic prediction of the
time delay, an elegant addition to the tests of general relativity. This last entry in the
timeline in Figure 6, line 38, is taken to mark the nominal end of the naissance of
experimental gravity physics. More recent measurements of microwave signals trans-
mitted from the ground to the Cassini spacecraft, retransmitted by the spacecraft,
and detected on the ground, as the line of sight to the spacecraft passed near the Sun,
established the relativistic eﬀect of the Sun on the timing of radiation to a few parts
in 105 (Bertotti, Iess, and Tortora 2003).

Yet another aspect of relativistic timing is the shift to the red in the spectra
of distant galaxies of stars. In the 1950s and earlier it was reasonable to ask, with
Zwicky (1929), whether the starlight might have been shifted to the red by some
physical process operating along the line of sight, rather than by the expansion of
the universe. This question helped inspire Kennedy and Thorndike (1931) to check
one conceivable physical eﬀect on the frequency of propagating light: they measured
the eﬀect on the frequency of the 5641 ˚A mercury line after moving through 50,000
volts potential diﬀerence, “because it has required only a modiﬁcation of apparatus
devised for another purpose,” with a null result.

Tolman (1930, eq. 30) noted that a “tired light” model is tested by measuring
how the surface brightness of a galaxy varies with its redshift. Under standard local
physics, and assuming the light propagates freely through a spacetime described by
a metric tensor, Liouville’s theorem tells us that the integrated surface brightness
(energy received per unit time, area, and solid angle) varies with the ratio of the
observed wavelength λobs of a spectral feature to the laboratory wavelength λem at
the source as i ∝ (λem/λobs)4. One of the four powers of λem/λobs may be attributed
to the loss of energy of each photon as its frequency decreases, one to time dilation
of the rate of detection of photons, and two powers to aberration in the solid angle of
a bundle of radiation. In a simple tired light model in a static universe only the ﬁrst
factor would operate: i ∝ (λem/λobs). Perhaps the most direct test is the spectrum
of the thermal Cosmic Microwave Background radiation discussed in Section 6.13.2.
Since the universe is observed to be optically thin to this radiation, standard physics
requires that the thermal form was produced when the universe was denser and
hotter. In standard physics the expansion to the present universe cools the radiation

32

but preserves its thermal spectrum. In a static tired light model an initially thermal
spectrum would grow distinctly nonthermal. The CMB spectrum is observed to be
very close to thermal

6.5 Gravitational Deﬂection of Light and Gravitational Lensing

Bertotti, Brill and Krotkov (1962) presented a careful review of the state of the tests
of general relativity. Figure 8 shows their summary of the test of the gravitational
deﬂection of light by the Sun for two sets of observations in favorable star ﬁelds. In
their assessment, the most important uncertainty was the conversion of distances of
stars from the Sun on the plates to angular distances from the Sun in the sky, in
the eclipse plates and in the comparison dark sky plates (which diﬀered because of
temperature diﬀerences and uncertainties in the positions of plates in the telescope).
Bertotti et al. concluded that the observed pattern of radial shifts of angular distances
during the eclipse “does not contradict the 1/r law predicted by general relativity,
but neither does it give much support to such a dependence on distance.” Indeed, one
sees in Figure 8 that the case for the 1/r law rests on the one star closest to the Sun
in one of the eclipses.

At the 1955 Bern meeting Trumpler (1956) listed ten measurements of the solar
gravitational deﬂection of light, all with probable errors of about 10%, and concluded
that “If one considers the various instruments and methods used and the many ob-
servers involved, the conclusion seems justiﬁed that the observations on the whole
conﬁrm the theory.” This of course assumes the 1/r law. We may conclude that, at
the level of these somewhat tepid assessments of the weight of the evidence, general
relativity in 1955 had passed two critical tests, from the orbit of the planet Mercury
and the observations of deﬂection of starlight by the Sun. As discussed in Section 6.4,
the third classical test, gravitational redshift, was even more doubtful.

Shapiro (1967) pointed out that radio interferometer observations of radio-loud
quasars could detect the predicted gravitational deﬂection. The ﬁrst results (Seiel-

Will be inserted by the editor

33

stad, Sramek, and Weiler 1970; Muhleman, Ekers, and Fomalont 1970) were about
as precise as the optical observations but capable of considerable improvement: The
solar gravitational deﬂection is now detected in directions over a large part of the
celestial sphere (Shapiro, Davis, Lebach, and Gregory 2004). Will (2015) reviewed
the history of this test.

Gravitational deﬂection causes a suﬃciently compact mass to act as a gravita-
tional lens. Renn, Sauer, and Stachel (1997) reviewed the early history of papers
on this eﬀect. Notable among them was Einstein’s (1936) publication of his earlier
thoughts about the double images and increase of apparent magnitude (intensity en-
hancement when lensing increases the solid angle of the image while preserving the
surface brightness) to be expected when one star passes nearly in front of another.
Renn et al. reported that Einstein was not optimistic about the possibility of an ob-
servation of these lensing eﬀects, but the intensity enhancement produced by lensing
by stars and planets is observed, and termed microlensing. Zwicky (1937) assessed
the prospects for detecting Einstein’s (1936) eﬀects when the gravitational lens is a
galaxy, with emphasis on the observationally important eﬀect of intensity enhance-
ment. Zwicky’s vision of gravitational lensing by the mass observed to be concentrated
around galaxies is now a valuable probe of the mass distribution on larger scales, in
the dark matter outside the concentration of stars. Zwicky’s informed discussion is
marked as line 11 in Figure 6.

Klimov (1963), Liebes (1964), and Refsdal (1964) independently presented more
detained analyses of the prospects of observing eﬀects of gravitational lensing. Klimov
discussed lensing of a galaxy by the mass concentration in a foreground galaxy close
to the line of sight, and Klimov took note of the Einstein ring produced at close
alignment if the lens is close enough to axially symmetric. Liebes and Refsdal mainly
discussed lensing by “point-like” mass concentrations such as stars, and they empha-
sized the phenomenon of intensity enhancement that has proved to be so observation-
ally important. Liebes considered the lensing signature of planets around stars, and
the possibility of observing lensing of more remote stars in our galaxy by intervening
visible stars or dark or faint objects that might contribute to the mass of the Milky
Way. This is the line of ideas taken up by the MACHO search for massive dark objects
(e.g. Alcock, Allsman, Alves, et al. 2000). Liebes cut a plastic lens that simulated the
properties of a gravitational lens (Liebes 1969). A disk source viewed through the
lens exhibited dual and ring images; a target placed in the lensed beam of a bright
source exhibited the intensity ampliﬁcation. Refsdal anticipated lensing measures of
Hubble’s constant Ho and lensing measures of galaxy masses.

Walsh, Carswell, and Weymann (1979) were the ﬁrst to identify an eﬀect of lensing:
a double image of a quasar. Wheeler pointed out in remarks at the 1959 Royaumont
Conference (Mercier and Kervaire 1956, pp. 269 – 271) that lensing produces an odd
number of images, but the odd image in the Walsh et al. observation is demagni-
ﬁed, perhaps obscured by dust in the lensing galaxy, and certainly hard to observe.
Gravitational lensing now probes the mass distributions in clusters of galaxies (Hoek-
stra, Bartelmann, Dahle, et al. 2013) and the mean mass distribution around galaxies
(Bahcall and Kulier 2014).

6.6 Gravitational Waves

Joseph Weber’s interest in gravitational waves traces back at least to the analysis
by Weber and Wheeler (1957) of the Reality of the Cylindrical Gravitational Waves
of Einstein and Rosen (in a physical system that is translationally invariant in one
direction, but not axisymmetric). Although the paper by Einstein and Rosen (1937)
presented an argument for the reality of gravitational waves that carry energy, as

34

The European Physical Journal H

analogs of electromagnetic waves, the idea was still controversial. One sees this in
Einstein’s note at the end of the paper (after a skeptical reception of an earlier version
by The Physical Review), that he had corrected the conclusion “after the departure
of Rosen.” In his contribution to the proceedings of the 1955 Bern Conference Rosen
concluded by endorsing the “conjecture . . . that a physical system cannot radiate
gravitational energy.” The point that gravitational waves certainly carry energy, which
can be deposited as work by a gravitational wave acting on a viscous body, was made
by Weber and Wheeler (1957), by Feynman (in DeWitt 1957, p. 143) at the Chapel
Hill Conference, and by Bondi (1962), at the Royaumont Conference. Bondi also
argued that gravitational waves can be produced by a nongravitational explosion,
but that, for a purely gravitational binary star system, “I am somewhat doubtful
whether such a system will radiate at all” (I suspect because Bondi did not consider
the eﬀect of radiation reaction on the equation of motion of the point-like stars).
Despite this quite confusing theoretical situation, Weber (1962) presented to this
conference his practical examination of how to build a gravitational wave detector.
This was one of the earliest steps toward the development of experimental gravity
physics (and accordingly is entered in line 18 in Fig. 6).

Nancy Roman, who was the ﬁrst Chief of the Astronomy, Solar Physics, and Geo-
physics Programs at the NASA Oﬃce of Space Sciences, saw the growing possibility
and interest in better probes of relativity aﬀorded by space science, and organized
the July 1961 NASA Conference on Experimental Tests of Theories of Relativity. The
proceedings (Roman 1961) record Weber’s report of progress in building a gravita-
tional wave detector (Weber 1960), and his discussion of the measurements of modes
of acoustic oscillation of the Earth, including the interesting quadrupole modes that
would be excited by the long wavelength gravitational waves of general relativity
(Forward, Zipoy, Weber, et al. 1961; marked as line 23 in Fig. 6). Weber discussed
the possibility of placing gravimeters on the Moon, which he expected would be a
quieter place to look for the excitation of quadrupole modes of acoustic oscillation
by gravitational waves. A decade later the Apollo 17 astronauts placed a Lacoste-
type spring gravimeter on the Moon (Giganti, Larson, Richard, and Weber 1973). An
unfortunate 2% miscalculation of the masses needed to trim the balance to the grav-
itational acceleration at the position where the gravimeter was placed on the Moon
prevented operation at design sensitivity. Interest in this approach continues: Lopes
and Silk (2014) analyzed the possibility of detecting gravitational wave excitation of
quadrupole acoustic oscillations of the Sun.

Weber (1969, 1970) reported evidence that his bar detectors had found gravita-
tional waves, based on coincident detection of events: unusual departures from the
mean noise ﬂuctuations in bar detectors separated by 1,000 km, at dimensionless
strain estimated to be h ∼ 10−16. This attracted considerable interest from theorists
and experimentalists. The complaint that the indicated gravitational wave strain cor-
responds to an unreasonably large energy density certainly was worth noting, but
the central issue was whether the events were real, perhaps signaling the eﬀect of
gravitational waves in some better theory, or perhaps a signature of some other new
phenomenon. Tyson and Giﬀard (1978) reviewed several independent experiments
that did not conﬁrm Weber’s event rates. But the neutrinos detected from super-
nova 1987A showed an interesting correlation with Weber Bar events in detectors in
Maryland and Rome (Aglietta, Badino, Bologna, et al. 1989). It is diﬃcult to ﬁnd a
community consensus of what this might mean. In a review of Weber Bar detectors,
Aguiar (2011) wrote: “Did the bars detect gravitons from SN1987A or some other
particles that excited the bars by thermoelastic processes? In any case, we hope that
another supernova will solve this problem.”

In the scalar-tensor gravity theory there could be observable eﬀects of tempo-
ral or spatial variations of the scalar ﬁeld value that determines the local strength

of gravity. Morgan, Stoner, and Dicke (1961) searched for an annual periodicity of
earthquakes, perhaps triggered by an annual variation in the scalar ﬁeld value as the
Earth moves around the Sun. Their conclusion was that “The occurrence of this pe-
riodicity would be understandable if the gravitational constant were to vary as the
earth-sun distance changes or as Earth’s velocity relative to a preferred coordinate
frame changes; however, the observed periodicity cannot be interpreted as conclusive
support for such a hypothesis.” A scalar wave could excite the Earth’s 20-minute
breathing mode (the high-Q nearly spherically symmetric mode with no nodes in the
radial function). Jason Morgan (1964, PhD Princeton) looked for geophysical, lunar
and planetary indications of this eﬀect, without signiﬁcant detection.

Dicke’s interest in the possibility of a laboratory detection of the low-frequency
modes of oscillation of the Earth that might be driven by long wavelength tensor
or scalar gravitational waves (as discussed by Forward, Zipoy, Weber, et al. 1961)
led to projects to build or modify LaCoste-type (spring) gravimeters, with sensitivity
increased by making use of the precision detection of the test mass deﬂection aﬀorded
by the phase-sensitive lock-in ampliﬁer techniques discussed in Section 5 (Robert
Moore 1966, PhD Princeton; Weiss and Block 1965; Block and Moore 1966). This work
contributed to the creation of networks for low-frequency seismology that produced
detailed detections of Earth’s low-frequency modes of oscillation. Jonathan Berger
(2016) recalled that, when he was a graduate student,

Barry Block came to IGPP (Walter Munk’s institution) at UCSD in 1965 (or
1966) followed shortly thereafter by Bob Moore. Bob brought with him 2 (I
think) modiﬁed LaCoste gravimeters which he had developed for the thesis
work at Princeton and afterwords at U. Maryland. At the same time, Freeman
Gilbert and George Backus (also at IGPP) were developing the theory and
mathematical methods for inverting normal mode data to resolve details of
Earth structure. These instruments soon produced some spectacular observa-
tions of the Earth’s normal modes from relatively frequent earthquakes that
whetted appetites for more such data.

This grew into the project, International Deployment of Accelerometers, with Berger
as director, that is now part of the Global Seismographic Network. It yields probes
of the internal structure of the Earth and measures of earthquakes, storm surges,
tsunamis, and underground explosions.8

Let us pause to consider how the analysis by Forward, Zipoy, Weber, et al. (1961) of
the possible eﬀect of low frequency gravitational waves on Earth’s modes of oscillation
helped interest the experimental gravity community in gravimeters, which aided the
development of global seismology, which detected low frequency Earth oscillations,
which Boughn, Vanhook, and O’Neill (1990) turned into further exploration of the
bounds on the energy density in long wavelength gravitational waves. And let us
consider also that the search for detection of gravitational waves may be dated to
have begun with Weber’s paper in the proceedings of the 1959 Royaumont Conference.
A quarter of a century later precision timing showed that the Hulse-Taylor binary
pulsar system is losing energy at the rate expected from radiation of gravitational
waves (Taylor and Weisberg 1982). A quarter of a century after that LIGO detected
gravitational waves (LIGO Scientiﬁc Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration 2016),
completing Weber’s vision.

My impression is that the very qualities that Weber needed to pioneer this dif-
ﬁcult science made it exceedingly diﬃcult for him to deal with critical reactions to
early results. Weber in the early 1960s impressed me for his great determination, his

indiﬀerence to experts who were not sure these waves even exist, his love of the chase
for a wonderful phenomenon, his energetic accounts in seminars at Princeton on how
he was building and instrumenting his detectors, and, to be noted, his checks of sig-
niﬁcance of signals by coincidences in detectors ﬁrst separated by a few kilometers,
then 1000 km. The near coincidence of events in well-separated LIGO interferometers
was a key element in the ﬁrst convincing gravitational wave detection.

6.7 Masses: Active, Passive, Inertial, and Annihilation

The equations

F = mig,

mig =

GMamp

,

E = mec2,

(13)

deﬁne four masses to be assigned to an object. In the ﬁrst equation F is the force,
mechanical or gravitational, on an object with inertial mass mi moving with accel-
eration g. In the second equation mp is the passive gravitational mass of the object
that is moving with acceleration g due to the gravitational force of attraction by a
second body with active gravitational mass Ma at distance r. In the last equation
me is the mass deﬁned by the annihilation energy E. These deﬁnitions follow Bondi
(1957), who was largely concerned with the possibility of negative mass. (At the time
some wondered whether antimatter falls up, as in Schiﬀ 1958.) To be discussed here
is the empirical situation in nonrelativistic physics, where in the standard model the
four masses are equal. (The situation is more complicated in relativistic situations.
In general relativity an ideal ﬂuid with mass density ρ and pressure p, with c = 1,
has active gravitational mass density ρ + 3p, inertial and passive gravitational mass
densities ρ + p, and energy density ρ.)

The E¨otv¨os experiment discussed in Section 5 tests whether the ratios mi/mp of
inertial to passive gravitational masses, and hence gravitational accelerations, may
depend on the natures of (compact, nearly massless) test particles. E¨otv¨os et al.
(1922) bounded diﬀerences of accelerations among a considerable variety of materials
to about 1 part in 108 (line 4 in Fig. 6). The static experiment in Dicke’s group,
with the synchronous detection scheme illustrated in Figure 4 at the heart of the
instrument, found that the gravitational accelerations of gold and aluminum toward
the Sun diﬀer by no more than 3 parts in 1011 (Roll, Krotkov, and Dicke 1964;
line 31 in Fig. 6). Braginskiˇi and Panov (1971) found that the fractional diﬀerence
of gravitational accelerations of aluminum and platinum is less than about 1 part in
1012. The present bound reaches parts in 1013 on fractional diﬀerences of gravitational
accelerations toward the Earth and Sun (Adelberger, Gundlach, Heckel, et al. 2009).
A diﬀerence in the ratio ma/mp of active to passive gravitational masses for
diﬀerent materials is in principle detectable as a diﬀerence in the measured values of
Newton’s constant G in Cavendish balance experiments using diﬀerent materials, but
precision measurements of G are diﬃcult. In Kreuzer’s (1968) survey of the literature
measurements of G, using materials ranging from glass to mercury, scatter by a few
parts in 103, indicating a similar bound on fractional diﬀerences of ma/mp among the
elements. To improve the constraint Lloyd Kreuzer (1966, PhD Princeton; Kreuzer
1968; line 34 in Fig. 6), ﬂoated a solid body in a ﬂuid at near neutral buoyancy,
meaning the passive masses of the body and the ﬂuid it displaced were nearly the
same. If the active masses of the body and the displaced ﬂuid were sensibly diﬀerent
it would be detected as a change in the gravitational attraction of a Cavendish-type
balance as the body was moved through the ﬂuid toward and away from the balance.
The inevitable departure from exact neutral buoyancy was measured by the force
needed to support the body in the ﬂuid as the ﬂuid mass density was adjusted, with
the balance response extrapolated to zero support. Kreuzer concluded that the ratios

Will be inserted by the editor

37

of active to passive gravitational masses of bromine (which dominated the mass of the
ﬂuid) and ﬂuorine (which dominated in the solid) diﬀer by less than about 5 parts in
105. (The reanalysis of Kreuzer’s data by Morrison and Hill 1973 conﬁrms Kreuzer’s
conclusion.)

If active and passive gravitational masses were not equivalent then, as Kreuzer
(1966) discussed, a dumbbell consisting of two diﬀerent massive bodies held at ﬁxed
separation by a rod would accelerate when freely moving. This is a situation we are
conditioned to reject but must consider, on the principle that unexamined assump-
tions in science ought to be challenged. Following Kreuzer’s experiment, Bartlett and
Van Buren (1986) pointed out that, if the composition of the Moon is not spherically
symmetric, as suggested by a diﬀerence between the centers of ﬁgure and mass of
the Moon, then the departure from equivalence of active and passive mass could con-
tribute to the acceleration of the Moon. Lunar Laser Ranging places a tight bound
on this eﬀect (Sec. 6.10.2).

As a graduate student, at Dicke’s invitation, I pored over measurements of binding
energies of atomic nuclei and nuclear spectroscopy mass measurements, to test the
equivalence of mass and binding energy, but without publishing. Much more recently
Rainville, Thompson, Myers, et al. (2005) and Jentschel, Krempel, and Mutti (2009)
examined budgets of energy and mass in radiative nuclear transitions. The γ-ray
wavelength was measured by crystal Bragg spectroscopy, and converted to annihila-
tion mass by standard values of  and c. The inertial mass diﬀerence was measured by
“cyclotron frequencies (inversely proportional to the mass) of ions of the initial and
ﬁnal isotopes conﬁned over a period of weeks in a Penning trap” (from Rainville et
al.). The conclusion from these impressively precise measurements is that the inertial
and annihilation energy masses agree to a few parts in 107.

6.8 Gravitational Frame-Dragging

Michelson and Gale’s (1925) paper on The Eﬀect of the Earth’s Rotation on the
Velocity of Light is notable for the heroic size of the Sagnac interferometer, 2010 ×
1113 feet (640 by 320 meters). Earth’s rotation was detected, but that is a long way
from detecting the relativistic prediction of frame-dragging (eq. [1]). Pugh (1959),
and Schiﬀ (1960) in collaboration with experimentalists at Stanford, realized that
advances in artiﬁcial satellite technology oﬀered a realistic possibility of detection
of frame-dragging. The demanding condition for detection is that the drag on the
satellite by light pressure and the last traces of the atmosphere be canceled well
enough to suppress torques on the gyroscopes. This was discussed at length at the
NASA Conference (Roman 1961), prompting the marking of the origin of Gravity
Probe B in Figure 6 (line 22) at 1961. The successful completion a half century
later, in a satellite in polar orbit, detected the predicted geodetic precession in the
plane of the orbit, and it detected the inertial frame-dragging normal to the orbit
to be expected from the rotation of the Earth. The frame-dragging was measured to
be 37.2 ± 7.2 milli arc seconds per year, consistent with the relativistic prediction
(Everitt 2015 and the following 20 papers on Gravity Probe B). Ciufolini and Pavlis
(2004) found a roughly matching result by analysis of the precision tracking of two
high-density LAGEOS Earth satellites, which do not have provision for cancellation
of atmospheric drag, but are dense enough to allow a reasonably secure correction.

6.9 Absolute Measurements of Gravitational Acceleration and

38

The European Physical Journal H

the Gravitational Constant

Precision measurements of the absolute value of the gravitational acceleration g have
some applications that are practical, as in monitoring ground water level changes,
and some that are curiosity-driven, as in probes of the Machian ideas reviewed in
Section 4. In the 1950s measurements of the absolute value of g (expressed in estab-
lished standards of length and time, with surveys that transfer the value of g from one
place to another) used carefully designed pendulums or freely falling objects timed
by photoelectric detection of intersections of light beams. James Faller (1963, PhD
Princeton) reviewed discussions of the precision measurement of g one might hope
for by using a Fabry-P´erot optical interferometer with one of the plates freely falling.
The measurement of the changing distance between the plates would be superbly
accurate, apart from the great problem of sensitivity of the interference pattern to
the angle between the plates.

Faller’s solution was to replace the plates by corner reﬂectors, in the arrangement
sketched in Figure 9 (in the experiment marked as line 28 in Figure 6). Light from
the source at the lower right partially passed through the half-silvered mirror S1,
returned from the ﬁxed corner reﬂector FM1 on the upper right, and was reﬂected
by S1 to the photomultiplier. Part of the light from the source was reﬂected by S1
and S2, returned by the freely falling corner reﬂector MM1 on the upper left, and
arrived at the photomultiplier to be combined with the light from the other path. The
ﬁxed mirrors FM2 and FM3 served as calibration. The bandwidth of the light source
was broad enough that the position of the freely falling corner reﬂector at a fringe,
relatively bright or dark, was deﬁned by the condition that at the photomultiplier
the phase as a function of wavelength at ﬁxed falling corner reﬂector position was
at an extremum. The precision this allowed in Faller’s thesis measurement of g was
comparable to what was achieved by other methods, but could be improved. Faller
and Hammond (1967) showed that the newly available stabilized lasers with sharply
deﬁned wavelength allowed sharply deﬁned fringes and a much better measurement.
The present standard (advertised in http://www.microglacoste.com/fg5x.php),
with applications such as long-term monitoring of water table levels and continental

uplift following the last Ice Age, in Faller’s (2015) words “pretty much is the legacy
of what, with Bob’s help, I started in Palmer Lab.”

One would also like to have an accurate absolute measurement of Newton’s grav-
itational constant, G, the better to weigh the Earth and the rest of the solar system,
as well as to establish a tight system of fundamental physical parameters. An indica-
tion of the diﬃculty is that Heyl (1930) measured G = 6.670 × 10−8 cm3 g−1 sec−2,
with a scatter among gold, platinum, and glass weights at about a part in 104, and
the present CODATA standard is G = 6.6741 × 10−8 cm3 g−1 sec−2, with fractional
uncertainty reduced from Heyl by about a factor of two. Faller (2014a) reviewed this
situation.

6.10 Evolution of G

Section 4 reviewed Dirac’s Large Numbers Hypothesis (LNH), that the strength of
the gravitational interaction (as measured by the value of G in standard units) may
be very weak because it has been decreasing for a very long time. The idea has been
probed in several ways.

6.10.1 Meteorites, Eclipses, and Geophysics

Teller (1948) pointed out that a larger G in the past would imply a hotter Sun,
which if too hot would violate evidence of early life on Earth. Teller made an im-
portant point (which is marked as line 14 in Fig. 6). But the Hubble age then was
underestimated by a factor of seven, meaning the constraint on the evolution of G is
signiﬁcantly less tight than Teller estimated. Dicke (1962b) added the consideration
that Earth’s climate is seriously aﬀected by the greenhouse eﬀect of water vapor and
the opposite eﬀect of clouds. He argued that the net eﬀect is quite uncertain, but that
this consideration further weakens Teller’s constraint. Dicke (1962b) also noted that
stellar evolution models with standard gravity physics predict that the luminosity
of the Sun has been increasing: The conversion from hydrogen to helium that keeps
the Sun shining has been increasing the mean molecular weight in the core, which in-
creases the temperature required to support it, which increases the luminosity. Dicke’s
colleague at Princeton Universirt, Martin Schwarzschild, estimated that the present
luminosity of the Sun, relative to the luminosity minimum at formation 4.5 Gyr ago,
is Lpresent/Linitial = 1.6. (This estimate is in Schwarzschild 1958, eq. [23.8]. A more
recent estimate in Ribas 2010 is Lpresent/Linitial = 1.3.) A larger G in the past might
have helped keep Earth warm enough for early life. But, as Dicke argued, the relation
between the history of the surface temperature of the Earth and the luminosity of
the Sun was quite uncertain, a problem still with us.

A quantitative bound on the past luminosity of the Sun (in Peebles and Dicke
1962b; the title, The temperature of meteorites and Dirac’s cosmology and Mach’s
Principle, makes manifest Dicke’s motivation) considered that if G were larger in
the past it would mean that parent meteorite bodies would have been warmer, the
diﬀusive loss of radiogenic argon faster, and the apparent potassium-argon radioactive
decay ages of meteorites smaller than their true ages. We were following Goles, Fish,
and Anders (1960), who used this consideration to constrain the environments of
parent meteorite bodies under the assumption of conventional physics. We concluded
that the strength of the gravitational interaction could not have been decreasing more
rapidly than

and we assured the reader that “This limit does not seem to rule out any of the
cosmologies in which the strength of the gravitational interaction is variable.” That
included the estimate in equation (3) based on the LNH. This result is marked at
line 26 in Figure 6.

Ideas about how a decreasing value of G might be manifest in geophysical phe-
nomena were mentioned in Section 4. In particular, a secular change of G would
aﬀect the Earth’s moment of inertia, its distribution of angular momentum in the
solid Earth and in atmospheric and oceanic currents, and its orbit around the Sun,
all of which could have a detectable eﬀect on timings of solar eclipses, which have
been recorded back to the time of Babylon some 3000 yr ago. Curott (1966) examined
the eclipse evidence, and Dicke (1966) analyzed the many geophysical considerations
that may help determine the eﬀect of a secular evolution of G on the evolution of
the angular velocity of the Earth’s surface and hence the predicted eclipse timings.
Dicke concluded that the evidence bounds the evolution of G at about the level of
equation (14), but by an approach that is so diﬀerent that it merits a separate entry
as line 35 in Figure 6.

6.10.2 Lunar Laser Ranging

At the Chapel Hill Conference, Dicke (1957a) expressed his interest in better mea-
surements of the motion of the Moon. Though not explained in the proceedings, he
was at the time seeking to test whether the strength of gravity has been decreasing
as the universe expands (eq. [3]; Sec. 6.10). This is the stated goal in the papers on
tracking artiﬁcial satellites or the Moon by Hoﬀmann, Krotkov, and Dicke (1960) and
Dicke, Hoﬀmann, and Krotkov (1961) (with, in the ﬁrst of these papers, acknowledge-
ment of contributions by all 13 members of the Gravity Research Group at that time,
some much more important for the project than others). These two papers discussed
the prospects for precision optical tracking of the angular position of a satellite by a
“searchlight illuminating a corner reﬂector,” or else “sunlight illuminating a sphere,”
or a “ﬂashing light on the satellite.” The proposal had become more speciﬁc in the
paper by Alley et al. (1965) with the title, and the argument for, Optical Radar
Using a Corner Reﬂector on the Moon. The author list included Dicke, with Alley,
Bender, and Faller, who were his former graduate students, Wilkinson, who was then
an assistant professor in Dicke’s group, and two who were not in the group: Henry
Plotkin at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Peter Franken at the University
of Michigan, Ann Arbor. The paper mentioned the possibility of a “few interesting
measurements,” including “an accurate check on lunar orbit theory,” “Simultaneous
ranging by several stations, with known geographical positions, could be used to mea-
sure the size and shape of the earth,” a “connection could be established between the
American and European geodesic networks,” and “disturbances or periods which are
not explained by the perturbations contained in the lunar theory . . . if seen, might be
identiﬁed with gravitational wave eﬀects.”

Recollections of how this line of thought grew into the Lunar Laser Ranging Exper-
iment are in the proceedings of Session 2 of the 2014 19th International Workshop on
Laser Ranging, Annapolis. In these proceedings Plotkin (2014) recalled that in 1960
he moved to the Goddard Spaceﬂight Center, where his “job was supposed to be
developing optical systems for photographing satellites and stars in order to calibrate
Microwave and Radio tracking systems,” and that he stopped at Princeton along the
way to discuss the task with Dicke, Carroll Alley, and others. Dicke “suggested that
when I get to NASA I consider putting cube corners on the moon or launching cube
corners into space orbits and photographing reﬂections from powerful searchlight illu-

41

mination.” In an undated document9 Plotkin reported that by 1964 “NASA launched
the ﬁrst of the satellites with arrays of fused-quartz cube corner retroreﬂectors to act
as cooperative targets for laser radar stations” which “achieved ranging precision of
about 1 meter.” This is the methodology for the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment
(and for the precision tracking of the high mass density LAGEOS satellites used to
map Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld, and, as a byproduct, detect relativistic inertial frame
dragging; Sec. 6.8). Also in the Annapolis proceedings are Faller’s (2014b) recollec-
tions of the corner reﬂectors he used in his absolute measurement of the acceleration
of gravity (Sec. 6.9), his work on the design of the arrays of corner reﬂectors to be
placed on the Moon, and the serious challenge he and colleagues faced in ﬁnding the
ﬁrst photons to be received by reﬂection from the corner reﬂectors, made even more
diﬃcult because the corner reﬂector arrays were not placed at the planned position
on the Moon. Faller (2014b) also presented Dicke’s previously unpublished essay on
Lunar Laser Ranging Reminiscences. Alley (1972) described his recollections of the
project. Bender (2015) recalled that

in Sept., 1968 when we ﬁrst heard that the Apollo 11 astronauts would only
be allowed to spend 2 hours on the lunar surface, compared with the 4 hours
originally planned, Bob Dicke being the one who asked if a reﬂector package
could be considered as a contingency experiment for the Apollo 11 landing
may well have carried more weight with the NASA people than if he hadn’t
been involved.

The NASA Apollo 11 astronauts placed this ﬁrst package of corner reﬂectors on the
Moon in July 1969. The USSR Lunokhod 1 unmanned lunar rover left the second
package on the Moon after launch in November 1970.

The origin of the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment is marked at line 32 in the
timeline in Figure 6, at publication of the paper by Alley et al. (1965) that argued for
this program. Faller, Winer, Carrion et al. (1969) reported that measurements of the
distance to the corner reﬂectors “can now be made with an accuracy approaching 15
cm.” Distance measurements to the lunar corner reﬂectors now approach a precision
of 1 mm, and they tightly constrain possible departures from general relativity theory,
including the Strong Equivalence Principle mentioned in Section 4.3. The inferred rel-
ative gravitational accelerations in the Sun-Moon-Earth system bound the fractional
diﬀerences of the ratios of inertial to passive gravitational masses of the Earth and
Moon to no more than about a part in 1013 (Williams, Turyshev, and Boggs 2012). It
is particularly relevant for the thread of this history that the evolution of the strength
of gravity is bounded to

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) dG

dt

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) <∼ 10−12 yr−1.

(15)

Dicke’s dream of tests of gravity physics from precision measurements of the motion
of the Moon, which he ﬁrst mentioned in print in 1957, has been abundantly realized.
But Hoﬀmann, Krotkov, and Dicke (1960) had proposed tracking satellites to look
for evolution of G “that might be expected to amount to about one part in 1010 per
year,” which is two orders of magnitude larger than the bound.

6.10.3 The CMB anisotropy and the evolution of G

The strength of the gravitational interaction in the early universe is constrained by
the pattern of variation of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation across the sky
(Sec. 6.13.2). The pattern is largely determined by the evolving dynamical interaction

The European Physical Journal H

of the spatial distributions of matter and radiation through to redshift z ∼ 1000,
when the primeval plasma combined to largely neutral atomic hydrogen, eliminating
the non-gravitational interaction between matter and radiation. Bai, Salvado, and
Stefanek (2015) found that the standard six-parameter ΛCDM cosmology, with G
as a seventh free parameter, ﬁtted to the Planck CMB satellite data (as in Planck
Collaboration 2015a), with other cosmological tests, constrains the value of G (in
standard units for the rest of physics) at high redshift to be within about 8% of the
laboratory value.

6.10.4 Summary

We have now impressively tight and reasonably direct bounds on the evolution of the
strength of gravity from measurements of the orbit of the Moon (eq. 15) and pulsar
timing (Zhu, Stairs, Demorest, et al. 2015), which we have noted is much tighter
than the eﬀect Dicke had expected. We also have a wonderfully tight constraint on
how gravity physics might have evolved over the past three orders of magnitude
of expansion of the universe, a result quite diﬀerent from what Dicke (1968) had
assumed in his computation of primeval element abundances in the scalar-tensor
gravity theory. Discussion of this illustration of how empirical evidence can conﬂict
with elegant ideas, here the readings of Mach’s Principle and Dirac’s Large Numbers
Hypothesis discussed in Section 4, continues in Sections 6.12 and 7.1.

6.11 Evolution of the Weak and Electromagnetic Interactions

Dicke (1957a,b) proposed extending Dirac’s LNH, that the strength of gravity is very
small because it has been decreasing for a very long time, to a decreasing strength of
the weak interaction, but more slowly because the weak interaction is not as weak as
gravity. This would mean β-decay rates are decreasing. Dicke (1959a) tested for this
by comparing radioactive decay ages of meteorites from α- and β-transitions, with
inconclusive results.

long-standing idea that the Planck length(cid:112)G/c3 may play some role in determining

The electromagnetic interaction is even less weak, but Dicke (1959b) pointed to the

an eﬀective momentum cutoﬀ for quantum ﬁeld theory (e.g. Landau 1955; Arnowitt,
Deser, and Misner 1960). If G were decreasing, and the Planck length decreasing with
it, maybe the ﬁne-structure constant α = e2/c that measures the strength of the
electromagnetic interaction is decreasing, perhaps as the absolute value of the loga-
rithm of the Planck length (Landau 1955). Dicke set me the dissertation topic of an
evolving electromagnetic interaction (Phillip James Edwin Peebles 1961, PhD Prince-
ton; Peebles and Dicke 1962c). A dynamical value of α implies a ﬁfth force; the thesis
ﬁnessed that by introducing two metric tensors as well as the scalar ﬁeld to replace α
(since developed in much more detail in Lightman and Lee 1973). I found empirical
limits on the rate of evolution of α from estimates of how a changing ﬁne-structure
constant would aﬀect relative rates of radioactive decay by α-particle emission, nu-
clear ﬁssion, positron emission, and electron capture and emission. Estimates to the
consistency of published radioactive decay ages of meteorites and terrestrial samples
led to the conclusion that “the data could not be used to eliminate a change in α of
0.1% in the past 4.4 billion years” (line 25 in Fig. 6).

Recent bounds are better. Examples are

In the second through fourth lines ∆α/α is the allowed fractional change in the value
of the ﬁne-structure constant and t is the time to the present from the time at the
redshift z of observation. The ﬁrst line is a “preliminary constraint” from comparisons
of optical atomic clock rates of aluminum and mercury ions (Rosenband, Hume, and
Schmidt 2008). The second line is from bounds on shifts of the resonant energies
for slow neutron capture by ﬁssion products in the Oklo natural nuclear reactor.
The geophysical considerations are complicated, but the many reanalyses (Shlyakhter
1976: Damour and Dyson 1996) argue for reliability of the bound. The third line is
an example of constraints from line spacings in quasar spectra (Albareti, Comparat,
Guti´errez, et al. 2015). The last line is the constraint from the pattern of variation
of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation across the sky, ﬁtted to the ΛCDM
cosmological model (Planck Collaboration 2015a). For another review of the history of
ideas about the value and possible evolution of the ﬁne-structure constant see Kragh
(2003).

The length of the list in equation (16) is another illustration of the continuing
research on probes of the idea that local physics may be inﬂuenced by the global
nature of the universe in which it operates. Motivations for this idea have evolved
from the Machian arguments that so fascinated Dicke and others, but the interest in
holistic concepts continues.

6.12 Tests and applications of the scalar-tensor theory

In their exploration of tests of the scalar-tensor theory, Brans and Dicke (1961) found
that the most demanding constraint was from the measured precession of the orbit
of the planet Mercury, which required that the parameter w in the scalar-tensor
gravity theory (eq. [4]) satisfy w > 6, under the then implicit assumption of a correct
accounting of the masses that determine the orbit. But Dicke (1964) reminded the
reader that, before relativity, the excess precession in Newtonian gravity theory was
imagined to be caused by mass not taken into account in the standard computations,
and that

One old suggestion seems not to have had the attention that it deserved. If the
Sun were very slightly oblate, the implied distortion of the sun’s gravitational
ﬁeld would result in a rotation of the perihelia of the planets. To produce a
discrepancy in Mercury’s orbit as great as 8 per cent of the Einstein value would
require an excessively small visual oblateness, only 5 parts in 105 amounting
to a diﬀerence between the solar equatorial and polar radii of only 0.05” arc.

One might imagine that the Sun is slightly oblate because the solar interior is rotating
more rapidly than the surface, maybe a result of spinup as matter was drawn into
the growing Sun, in line with the far shorter rotation periods of the gas giant planets
Jupiter and Saturn, and that the rotation of the solar surface was slowed by the
transfer of angular momentum to the solar wind, as Dicke inspired me to analyze in
some detail.

Dicke (1964) reported that he, Henry Hill, and Mark Goldenberg had “built a
special instrument to observe photoelectrically the Sun’s oblateness, and preliminary

44

The European Physical Journal H

measurements were made during a few weeks toward the close of the summer of 1963.”
Dicke and Goldenberg (1967) later reported that the measured fractional diﬀerence
of equatorial and polar radii is 5.0 ± 0.7 parts in 105, about what Dicke (1964) felt
would allow an interesting value of the scalar-tensor parameter w. The result was
not widely welcomed, in part because it challenged general relativity theory, and
certainly in part because identifying and measuring a level surface on the Sun is
seriously challenging. Subsequent measurements by Hill, Clayton, Patz, et al. (1974),
and Hill and Stebbins (1975), used techniques that Hill, then in the Gravity Research
Group, and his Princeton graduate student Zanoni, originally meant to be used for
measurement of the gravitational deﬂection of starlight passing near the Sun without
the aid of a Solar eclipse. This required design for the strong rejection of diﬀracted
sunlight (Carl Zanoni 1967, PhD Princeton; Zanoni and Hill 1965), which beneﬁtted
the design of the Hill et al. experiments. Their conclusion was that the solar oblateness
is too small to challenge general relativity. This proved to be consistent with the probe
of the internal rotation of the Sun aﬀorded by the splitting of frequencies of modes
of solar oscillation with diﬀerent azimuthal numbers m, which revealed that the solar
interior is rotating nearly as a solid body at close to the mean of the rotation rates
seen on the surface (Thompson, Christensen-Dalsgaard, Miesch, and Toomre 2003).
Rozelot and Damiani (2011) reviewed the history and status of this subject. We may
conclude that the mass distribution in the Sun is not likely to have disturbed the
test of general relativity from the orbit of Mercury. The Dicke and Goldenberg (1967)
measurement is marked at line 36 in the timeline (Fig. 6), as a step toward closing
the case for this important test of gravity physics.

The remarkably tight bound on the scalar-tensor gravity theory from the Cassini
satellite radar timing experiment is w > 104.5 (Bertotti, Iess, and Tortora 2003).
In simple solutions for the expansion of the universe in the scalar-tensor theory
this bound implies that the rate of change of the strength of gravity is limited to
− ˙G/G <∼ 10−14 yr−1, tighter even than the more direct bounds from the Lunar Laser
Ranging Experiment (eq. [15]) and pulsar timing (Zhu, Stairs, Demorest, et al. 2015).
Mchugh (2016) reviewed the history of tests that have progressively tightened the
bound on w. It is clear that the original vision of the scalar-tensor theory must be
scaled back to at most a small perturbation to general relativity. But the scalar-
tensor theory still fascinates, ﬁguring in the search for a deeper gravity physics, as
one sees by its frequent mention in the review, Beyond the cosmological standard
model (Joyce, Jain, Khoury, and Trodden 2015). And an excellent experimental pro-
gram similarly can lead in unexpected directions. The solar distortion telescope Dicke
ﬁrst designed in the early 1960s was turned to detection of evolution of the solar sur-
face temperature as a function of solar latitude during ﬁve years of the solar cycle, a
serious contribution to the continuing attempts to interpret the observed variation of
the solar constant with the sunspot cycle (Kuhn, Libbrecht, and Dicke 1988). Kuhn,
Bush, Emilio, and Scholl (2012) review the history and present status of precision
space-based measurements of the shape of the Sun.

6.13 Cosmology and the great extension of tests of gravity physics

At the 1955 Berne Conference, Jubilee of Relativity Theory, Walter Baade discussed
progress in the measurement of a fundamental datum for cosmology, the extragalactic
distance scale. General relativity theory had inspired modern cosmology, and it was
recognized then that the cosmological tests might test relativity. This has grown into
a very rich subject.

6.13.1 The Expanding Universe

Hubble (1929) found the ﬁrst reasonably clear evidence of the linear relation between
galaxy redshifts and distances,

v = Hor,

(17)

which Lemaˆıtre (1927) had shown is to be expected if the universe is expanding in a
homogeneous and isotropic way. The cosmological redshift, z, is deﬁned by the ratio of
wavelengths of features in the observed spectrum and the laboratory wavelengths at
emission, 1+z = λobs/λem. At small z the redshift may be considered to be a Doppler
shift, v = cz, where the recession velocity is v. The distance r may be inferred from
the inverse square law using estimates of the intrinsic luminosities of observed objects,
expressed as absolute magnitudes, using the observed energy ﬂux densities, expressed
as apparent magnitudes. A commonly used term thus is the redshift-magnitude re-
lation (though one also uses the relation between intrinsic linear sizes and observed
angular sizes). This redshift-magnitude relation also describes observations of objects
at greater distances, where the redshift z is large, and one looks for the relativistic
eﬀects of spacetime curvature.
Hubble and Humason (1931) considerably improved the case for equation (17),
reaching redshift z ∼ 0.07 for giant galaxies, and Hubble (1936) showed still better
evidence in a larger sample that reached z (cid:39) 0.15. These results were very inﬂuential
in the development of cosmology. The Hubble and Humanson paper on measurements
of the redshift-magnitude relation accordingly is marked at line 7 in Figure 6.

Another important early advance in cosmology was Hubble’s (1936) deep counts
of galaxies as a function of limiting apparent magnitude (line 10 in Fig. 6). The counts
were not inconsistent with a homogeneous large-scale distribution of the galaxies, that
is, Einstein’s Cosmological Principle, and the counts reached an impressively large
redshift (estimated at z ∼ 0.4 in Peebles 1971). Systematic errors in Hubble’s counts
were problematic enough that they could not rule out Mandelbrot’s (1975) argument
discussed in Section 7.1 for a fractal galaxy distribution with fractal dimension D
well below three, but one could conclude that, if there were an observable edge to the
universe of galaxies, the most distant ones would be ﬂying away at near relativistic
speeds.
It was understood early on (e.g., Tolman 1934 §185) that the relativistic Friedman-
Lemaˆıtre cosmological models predict that at high redshift there may be a departure
from the redshift-magnitude relation implied by equation (17), depending on the
model parameters (including the mean mass density and the mean curvature of space
sections at constant world time). Interest in detecting a departure from equation (17)
increased with the introduction of the Steady State cosmology, which makes a deﬁ-
nite prediction for the form of the redshift-magnitude relation (Bondi and Gold 1948;
Hoyle 1948). Humason, Mayall, and Sandage (1956) reported progress in measure-
ments of this relation, which had reached redshift z ∼ 0.2, a modest advance over
Hubble (1936) two decades earlier, and Sandage (1961) presented a detailed analysis
of the prospects for the application of this and other cosmological tests. We might
take as prophetic Sandage’s remark that (in his italics) “If observations show qo to
be −1, we cannot decide between a steady-state universe and a Lemaitre-Eddington
universe.” The parameter qo is a measure of the departure from equation (17), and
the value qo = −1 is predicted by the Steady State cosmology and by the relativistic
Friedman-Lemaˆıtre model if the expansion rate is dominated by Einstein’s cosmolog-
ical constant, Λ. As it happens, well-checked measurements of the redshift-magnitude
relation for supernovae (of type Ia, the explosions of white dwarf stars) are close to
qo = −1 (Riess, Filippenko, Challis, et al. 1998; Perlmutter, Aldering, Goldhaber, et
al. 1999). This is the degeneracy Sandage noted, but the degeneracy is broken, and
the classical Steady State cosmology convincingly ruled out, by other cosmological

46

The European Physical Journal H

tests. The evidence brieﬂy reviewed in Section 6.13.3 is that we live in a universe now
dominated by Einstein’s Λ.

Establishing the value of Hubble’s constant, Ho, in equation (17) by astronomical
methods requires determination of the intrinsic luminosities of extragalactic objects, a
diﬃcult task. Hubble and Humason (1931) slightly increased Hubble’s (1929) estimate
to Ho (cid:39) 560 km s−1 Mpc−1, a result that was generally accepted until the 1950s. For
example, in the monograph Relativity, Thermodynamics, and Cosmology, Tolman’s
(1934, §177) comment about the measured value of Ho was that “It is believed that the
uncertainty in the ﬁnal result is deﬁnitely less than 20 per cent.” But this meant that
the characteristic expansion time is 1/Ho ∼ 2×109 yr, which was uncomfortably short,
roughly half the largest radioactive decay ages of terrestrial minerals and estimates of
stellar evolution ages. (It was not widely discussed, but Lemaˆıtre’s 1931 model, with
the values of Λ, the cosmic mean mass density, and space curvature chosen so the
universe passed through a time of slow expansion, could reconcile the large estimate
of Ho with a long expansion time, though it required a very special adjustment of
parameters.) Bondi and Gold (1948) pointed out that the Steady State cosmology
allows galaxies of arbitrarily great age, albeit with great scarcity, thus allowing a
large age for our particular galaxy. But the Steady State cosmology predicts that the
mean age of the galaxies is 1/(3Ho) ∼ 6 × 108 yr (for the estimate of Ho accepted
then). Gamow (1954) remarked that this would mean that “we should ﬁnd ourselves
surrounded by a bunch of mere youngsters, as the galactic ages go,” which he remarked
seemed inconsistent with the observation that our Milky Way galaxy and neighboring
galaxies have similar mean stellar spectra, indicating similar stellar evolution ages.

Walter Baade improved the situation with his announcement at the 1952 Rome
Meeting of the International Astronomical Union that he had found a correction
to the extragalactic distance scale: he found that cepheid variable stars of type I
are considerably more luminous than previous estimates. This increased estimates of
extragalactic distances, and reduced Hubble’s constant, by a factor of about two, to
Ho = 180 km s−1 Mpc−1. (Baade’s report to the IAU is recorded in the Transactions
of the IAU, volume 8, p. 397, in a summary of the talks presented. Baade did not
contribute to the proceedings of the 1955 Bern Conference but, as noted in Sec. 2, we
can be sure the correction was presented and discussed.) Sandage (1958) helped some
more, by his correction for misidentiﬁcation of gaseous nebulae as luminous stars,
which brought his estimate to Ho (cid:39) 75 km s−1 Mpc−1, “with a possible uncertainty
of a factor of 2.” For further commentary on these and related developments see
Trimble (1996). The Planck Collaboration (2015b) recently announced the indirect
constraint Ho = 68 ± 1 km s−1 Mpc−1 derived from the CMB anisotropy spectrum.
This is close to Sandage’s central value, but still large enough to require Robertson’s
(1956) “disreputable Λ.”

The revision of the distance scale was inﬂuential enough to be marked in the time-
line (line 15, at Baade’s announcement of his correction at the 1952 IAU conference).
Its importance is illustrated by Bondi’s comment added to the second edition of his
book, Cosmology (Bondi 1960, p. 165): “It is not easy to appreciate now the extent
to which for more than ﬁfteen years all work in cosmology was aﬀected and indeed
oppressed by the short value of T (1.8×109 years) so conﬁdently claimed to have been
established observationally.” The remark is fair, but one might ask why the theorists
did not challenge the observers.

At the Bern Conference, Klein (1956) proposed an alternative to the large-scale
homogeneity assumed in the Friedman-Lemaˆıtre and Steady State models. Perhaps
the galaxies are drifting apart into empty space after an explosion of a local concen-
tration of matter. Klein may not have been aware that Hubble’s (1936) deep galaxy
counts require near relativistic recession velocities, hence a relativistic explosion. But
still the idea was well worth considering, because Einstein’s picture of a homogeneous

Will be inserted by the editor

47

universe was not apparent in the surveys of the galaxy distribution available at that
time. Oort (1958) emphasized this in his commentary on the observational situation
in cosmology, in the proceedings of the 1958 Solvay Conference on La structure et
l’ ´evolution de l’univers (Stoops 1958). Oort commenced his paper with the state-
ment that “One of the most striking aspects of the universe is its inhomogeneity.”
He went on to review the observations of clustering of galaxies on the largest scales
that could be surveyed then. But Oort was willing to estimate the cosmic mean mass
density, because the assumption of homogeneity in the average over still larger scales
was not inconsistent with Hubble’s (1936) deep galaxy counts. This situation was
starting to improve in the late 1950s, however. At the Chapel Hill Conference Lil-
ley (1957) discussed the Second Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources (Shakeshaft,
Ryle, Baldwin, et al. 1955). The main point of interest was the count of sources as
a function of ﬂux density, for which that Steady-State cosmology makes a deﬁnite
prediction. This test was spoiled by side-lobe confusion of source identiﬁcations. But
the map of angular positions of the radio sources was not so seriously aﬄicted, and
the strikingly uniform distribution of sources across the sky was not what one would
expect in a fractal universe (as discussed in Sec. 7.1). This, with the Hubble deep
counts and the observed linearity of the redshift-distance relation, was among the
ﬁrst observational indications that Einstein’s argument from Mach’s Principle for the
Cosmological Principle might be right (and for this reason the 2C catalog is entered
in line 16 in Fig. 6). More evidence for the Cosmological Principle came with the
discovery that space is ﬁlled with a sea of microwave radiation.

6.13.2 The sea of Cosmic Microwave Background radiation

In the late 1940s George Gamow, with his student Ralph Alpher and their colleague
Robert Hermann, developed a theory of element formation in the early stages of
expansion of the universe in an initially hot dense Friedman-Lemaˆıtre cosmologi-
cal model (Ralph Alpher 1948, PhD George Washington University; Gamow 1948;
Alpher, Follin, and Herman 1953). In this model space is ﬁlled with a sea of thermal
radiation now known as the Cosmic Microwave Background, or CMB. The properties
of this radiation have been read now in considerable detail that yields demanding
tests of general relativity theory. The story of how the thermal radiation in this hot
Big Bang model was predicted, and the community came to recognize its existence,
is complicated. My analysis of how Gamow and colleagues arrived at their cosmology
with its thermal radiation is in Peebles (2014). The book, Finding the Big Bang (Pee-
bles, Page, and Partridge 2009), recalls how the radiation was discovered, interpreted,
and its properties explored, and Peebles (2012) oﬀers personal recollections. A few
aspects of the CMB story should be considered here as part of the history of how
experimental gravity physics grew.

The CMB research program began in the summer of 1964 when Dicke gathered
Peter Roll, David Wilkinson, and me, junior faculty and a postdoc in his Gravity
Research Group, to discuss a proposal for what the universe might have been doing
before it was expanding. Dicke suggested that the universe may have been collapsing,
maybe in a cycle of expansion and contraction. The bounce would have been seriously
irreversible, producing entropy largely in the form of a sea of thermal radiation. This
idea of irreversibility of a bouncing universe traces back at least to Tolman (1934p.
443), who pointed out that if the bounce conserved entropy then each cycle would
last longer. Dicke proposed a speciﬁc physical model for entropy production in the
bounce. And it is very typical of Dicke that his idea suggested an experiment: a search
for the radiation.

Ideas about early universe physics have changed, but Dicke’s thought about en-
tropy production is worth recording here. Stars in the previous cycle would have been

48

The European Physical Journal H

converting hydrogen into heavier elements, releasing nuclear binding energy of sev-
eral million electron volts for each nucleon that became bound in a heavier atomic
nucleus. This binding energy would have been radiated as some 106 starlight photons
per nucleon, with photon energies on the order of an electron volt. If the contraction
before the bounce to the next expansion were deep enough, then during the contrac-
tion these starlight photons would have been blueshifted to energies above several
million electron volts, enough to photodissociate the elements heavier than hydro-
gen that were formed in stars during the previous expansion and collapse, yielding
fresh hydrogen for the generations of stars in the next expansion. Only a few of the
blueshifted starlight photons would have been needed to release each nucleon from
a heavier atomic nucleus, and the many remnant photons would relax to a sea of
thermal radiation.10

Dicke suggested that Roll and Wilkinson build a microwave radiometer that might
detect this CMB radiation. This was timely for Roll, because the Roll, Krotkov, and
Dicke (1964) E¨otv¨os experiment was completed, and it was timely for Wilkinson,
because he had not yet settled on a long-term project after arrival from completion
of his PhD at the University of Michigan. Dicke suggested that I look into possible
theoretical implications. At the time this was to me just another of Dicke’s many
ideas, most of which I found interesting to explore. This one was very interesting.
It was speculative, to be sure, but that was not out of the ordinary in the Gravity
Research Group. And it has proved to be wonderfully productive.

While at the MIT Radiation Laboratory during the Second World War, Dicke
invented much of the microwave radiometer technology Roll and Wilkinson used. We
had to remind him that Dicke, Beringer, Kyhl, and Vane (1946) had already used
a Dicke radiometer to place a limit on the CMB temperature, reporting a bound of
20 K on “radiation from cosmic matter at the radiometer wave-lengths,” 1.0 to 1.5 cm
(line 13 in Fig. 6). The radiometer Roll and Wilkinson built used Dicke’s technique of
suppression of receiver noise by switching between the horn antenna and a reference
source of thermal radiation at known temperature, for which Roll and Wilkinson used
liquid helium.

A half decade before Dicke’s suggestion to Roll and Wilkinson, an experimen-
tal microwave receiving system at the Bell Telephone Laboratories detected more
noise than expected from careful accounting of noise sources in the instrument (De-
Grasse, Hogg, Ohm, and Scovil 1959). This curious result was repeatable (as Hogg
2009 recalled), but not widely discussed. The noise originating in the receivers in the
Bell experiments was so small that Dicke’s switching technique was not needed, but

10 The estimate in Dicke and Peebles (1979) of the number of cycles needed to produce
the present entropy per nucleon is overly simpliﬁed. For a more direct approach, let the
energy density in the Cosmic Infrared Background (the CIB) produced by stars and active
galactic nuclei during the cycle of expansion and contraction be f times the energy in the
CMB. Suppose the bounce produces no entropy apart from the thermalization of the CIB,
and suppose nucleons and entropy are conserved in the bounce. Then an easy exercise shows
that the entropy per nucleon in the CMB after the bounce is (1+ f )3/4 times the entropy per
nucleon before the bounce. The observed energy density in the CIB is about f ∼ 0.1 times
the energy in the CMB (Hauser, Arendt, Kelsall, et al. 1998). If the CIB is not going to
receive much more energy in the rest of the present cycle, then in this model the entropy per
nucleon in the next cycle will be 1.13/4 times the entropy per nucleon in this cycle, roughy
a 10% increase. Not addressed, of course, is what might have caused the bounce, and how
the quite clumpy distribution of matter, including black holes, at the end of this cycle could
have become so very close to the near homogeneous condition we may expect to obtain at
the start of the next cycle, as it did at the start of our cycle according to the established
cosmology. The Steinhardt and Turok (2007) model oﬀers a way to deal with these issues,
but in a manner that eliminates the entropy Dicke was thinking about.

Penzias and Wilson (1965) used it to remove any chance that the “excess antenna
temperature” could be attributed to some error in the noise accounting, again using
a liquid helium reference source (though they could switch much more slowly than in
the Roll and Wilkinson radiometer, because their system noise was so small). Penzias
and Wilson also carefully tested and eliminated possible terrestrial sources of the ex-
cess radiation. They had an important result, and found an interpretation when they
learned of the Roll and Wilkinson search for a sea of radiation.

It was clear that this excess radiation, if extraterrestrial, must be close to isotropic,
because the signal did not vary appreciably as the Earth and antennas rotated. Par-
tridge and Wilkinson (1967) improved this to a demonstration that the large-scale
variation of the CMB intensity across the sky is less than about 3 parts in 103. This
was another early argument for Einstein’s Cosmological Principle: Space was known
to be close to transparent at these wavelengths, because because radio sources were
observed at high redshift, so the isotropy had to mean either that the universe is
nearly uniformly ﬁlled with this radiation, or else that the distribution of the radia-
tion is signiﬁcantly inhomogeneous but close to spherically symmetric, with us near
the center. The latter seemed less likely then, and it is now convincingly ruled out by
the cosmological tests.

In Gamow’s (1948) hot Big Bang picture, and the Dicke, Peebles, Roll, and Wilkin-
son (1965) interpretation of the Bell Laboratories excess noise, the radiation intensity
spectrum would be expected to be close to thermal. The spectrum would have to have
been very close to thermal in the early universe, when all was in very close to statis-
tical equilibrium, and the CMB thermal spectrum would be expected to have been
preserved as stars and galaxies formed, because the CMB heat capacity is large com-
pared to what is expected to be readily available in matter. In the Steady State
cosmology one is free to postulate continual creation of radiation as well as matter,
and one is free to postulate the spectrum of the radiation at creation. But the radi-
ation spectrum would not have relaxed to thermal because, as has been noted, the
universe is observed to be transparent at these wavelengths. And since the detected
radiation would be the spectrum at creation convolved over redshift it would require
an exceedingly contrived spectrum at creation to make the detected spectrum close
to thermal. One also had to consider that, in the Steady State model or a cold Big
Bang model, the Bell excess noise might be just the sum of local sources of microwave
radiation, but again in this picture the spectrum would not likely be close thermal.
The spectrum measurements were critical to the interpretation of this radiation.

The Penzias and Wilson (1965) and Roll and Wilkinson (1966) experiments op-
erated at 7.4 cm and 3.2 cm wavelength respectively. Their measurements at the two
wavelengths were consistent with the same eﬀective radiation temperature, which ar-
gued for a close to thermal spectrum in the long wavelength, Rayleigh-Jeans, part of
the spectrum. In an important early advance, George Field, Patrick Thaddeus, and
Neville Woolfe (whose recollections are in Peebles, Page, and Partridge 2009, pages
75-78, 78-85, and 74-75 respectively) recognized that the observation of absorption
of starlight by interstellar cyanogen (CN) molecules in the ﬁrst excited level as well
as in the ground level is most simply understood as the result of excitation of the
molecules by radiation at the wavelength 0.26 cm for excitation of the excited level,
and at an eﬀective radiation temperature close to the radiometer measurements. This
required that the CMB spectrum at 0.26 cm falls below the Rayleigh-Jeans power
law, about as predicted for a thermal spectrum. The departure from Rayleigh-Jeans
was demonstrated also by a radiometer intensity measurement at 0.33 cm (Boynton,
Stokes, and Wilkinson 1968). These results are marked at line 33 in the timeline in
Figure 6. (Much earlier than this McKellar 1941 had noted that the observed relative
absorption from the ﬁrst excited and ground levels of CN corresponds to an eﬀective
temperature of a few degrees Kelvin. This is not marked in Fig. 6 because its sig-

niﬁcance was not widely recognized until recognition of the signiﬁcance of the excess
noise in the Bell communications receivers, as Field and Woolf recalled in Peebles,
Page, and Partridge 2009.)

blackbody spectrum; the solid curve near the peak shows measurements.

Discussions in the 1960s of how cosmology and gravity physics might be tested by
CMB measurements were beclouded by indications of a considerable excess of energy
relative to a thermal intensity spectrum in measurements at wavelengths near and
shorter than the peak. In the hot Big Bang picture this excess would require the pos-
tulate that explosions of some sort in the early universe added considerable radiation
energy. Such explosions surely would have obscured any primeval patterns imprinted
on the radiation by whatever imprinted the departures from exact homogeneity in
the primeval mass distribution that grew into galaxies. The situation was resolved
a quarter of a century after identiﬁcation of the CMB, by two independent groups
(Mather, Cheng, Eplee, et al. 1990; Gush, Halpern, and Wishnow 1990). Both showed
that the spectrum is very close to thermal over the radiation intensity peak. Kogut
(2012) compiled these and the other spectrum measurements shown in Figure 10.
(For completeness it is to be noted that most of these data are from measurements
of the diﬀerences between the CMB intensity and the intensity of radiation from
black thermal sources at well-calibrated temperatures. Since the Planck spectrum is

not as well tested as these comparison measurements, the accurate conclusion is that
the CMB spectrum is very close to thermal.) The strikingly close agreement with a
thermal spectrum has two important implications.

First, since space in the universe as it is now is close to transparent, the CMB could
not have relaxed to the thermal spectrum shown in Figure 10 in the universe as it is
now: Formation of the thermal spectrum requires that the universe expanded from a
state dense and hot enough to have forced thermal relaxation. This serious evidence
that our universe is evolving, drawn from such a simple ﬁgure (albeit one based on
many far from simple measurements), is to be ranked with the memorable advances in
exploration of the world around us. The spectrum does not oﬀer a serious constraint
on gravity physics, however, because preservation of the thermal spectrum as the
universe expands follows if spacetime is well described by a close to homogeneous and
isotropic line element with standard local physics. The thermal spectrum in Figure 10
does not require general relativity theory.

Second, in 1990 the measured spectrum, thermal, was seen to agree with the idea
that the CMB has not been seriously disturbed from its primeval condition. This
meant there was a chance that measurements of the CMB could be mined for com-
parison to what is predicted by theories of the early universe and the cosmic evolution
that later grew into the galaxies, without serious nongravitational disturbance of the
CMB by the process of galaxy formation. Peebles and Yu (1970) introduced the radia-
tive transfer computation that predicts the primeval oscillations in the power spectra
of the distributions of the CMB and matter, under the assumptions of general relativ-
ity theory and adiabatic initial conditions (meaning the primeval spatial distribution
nγ(x) of the CMB photons and the distribution n(x) of the matter particles have
the same small fractional departures from exact homogeneity, δnγ/nγ = δn/n). The
ﬁrst pieces of evidence that these assumptions are on the right track were found some
three decades after Peebles and Yu, from measurements of the angular distribution
of the CMB and the spatial distribution of the galaxies. This history was reviewed in
Peebles, Page, and Partridge (2009).

6.13.3 The Cosmic Microwave Background and general relativity

To add to the picture of how tests of gravity physics grew out of research in the 1960s,
including the discovery and early steps in exploration of the Cosmic Microwave Back-
ground, I oﬀer this overview of the CMB-based cosmological tests that reached fruition
well after the naissance. These tests treat gravity physics in linear perturbation from
the relativistic Friedman-Lemaˆıtre solution. The linearity greatly simpliﬁes theoret-
ical predictions, but of course it means the tests are limited to this approximation.
The linear treatment of gravity, and the expansion of the universe, remains a good
approximation even at lower redshifts, when the mass distribution has grown strongly
nonlinear, because the gravitational potentials are still small, on the order of ∼ v2/c2,
everywhere except close to neutron stars and massive compact objects, presumably
black holes. But on the scale of things these black holes act as dark matter particles.
The standard and accepted six-parameter ΛCDM cosmology assumes the cosmo-
logically ﬂat Friedman-Lemaˆıtre solution to Einstein’s ﬁeld equation, with adiabatic,
Gaussian, and near scale-invariant initial conditions, and stress-energy tensor domi-
nated by the CMB, nucleons, neutrinos, the hypothetical nearly collisionless initially
cold nonbaryonic dark matter, or CDM, and Einstein’s cosmological constant, Λ.
Gravity in linear approximation is represented by two potentials, sourced by the ac-
tive gravitational mass density and the energy ﬂux density. At redshifts well above
zd (cid:39) 1200, when baryonic matter is fully ionized, the plasma and radiation act as a
slightly viscous ﬂuid with mass density ρ, pressure p, active gravitational mass density

52

The European Physical Journal H

ρ + 3p, and inertial and passive mass densities ρ + p, where ρ is the energy density
and p is the pressure. Near redshift zd the CMB radiation is to be described by its
distribution function in single-particle phase space, and the evolution in phase space
is described by the Boltzmann collision equation for the photons propagating accord-
ing to the equation of motion in the potentials, and scattering oﬀ the free electrons,
with the sources for the gravitational potentials to be computed as integrals over the
distribution functions for the CMB and the neutrinos described by their equation of
motion in their single-particle phase space. The dark matter is modeled as an ideal
pressureless ﬂuid, which behaves as Newton would expect, though with a relativistic
source for the potential.

The point of this perhaps unduly schematic accounting is that measurements of the
angular distribution of the CMB temperature and polarization probe a considerable
variety of elements of general relativity, though all in linear approximation. It would
be interesting to see eﬀects of adjusting some of these elements, to test sensitivity to
aspects of relativity, but diﬃcult to justify without an alternative viable theory. The
bottom line is that general relativity is seriously tested on the scale of the Hubble
length by the CMB measurements (as reviewed in Planck Collaboration 2015b and
the many references therein), to be added to the other cosmological tests.

6.14 Summary

Figure 11 shows the characteristic length scales of a selection of probes of gravity
physics, from the laboratory to the CMB measurements. The section numbers in
parentheses indicate discussions of lines of research that originated in the 1960s and
earlier. The picture has been made more complete by adding the important results
from observations of binary pulsars (Hulse and Taylor 1975), as noted in Section 6.12.
It could be made even more complete by marking the tests of the gravitational in-
teraction on scales down to 0.01 cm (Adelberger, Gundlach, Heckel, et al. 2009). Still
other probes of gravity physics are discussed by the Planck Collaboration (2015b) and
references therein. The ﬁgure is meant to illustrate the variety of tests that look at
gravity from many sides now, in many phenomena observed in a variety of methods,
on a broad range of length scales. The case for general relativity theory as a good ap-
proximation to what actually has been happening rests on the abundance and variety
of these tests. In my opinion the case is about as good as it gets in natural science.
Might there be a still better approximation, perhaps one that eliminates the need
for the hypothetical dark matter and Einstein’s cosmological constant in the present
standard theory? The case for existence of the dark matter is indirect, from the
consistency of the network of cosmological tests. A precedent is the case for the
existence of neutrinos before the Reines-Cowan detection, from the indirect evidence
from measured decay energy spectra and transition rates (as reviewed in Blatt and
Weisskopf 1952, though there was still uncertainty about the Fermi and Gamow-Teller
couplings). There is the big practical diﬀerence that the expected detection rate for
neutrinos was known, while the parameters for direct detection of dark matter are
far less well characterized. But in the philosophy adopted in this paper the weight of
the indirect evidence for neutrinos in the early 1950s was comparable to the weight of
the present indirect evidence for the dark matter of the ΛCDM theory (at the time of
writing). We may be surprised, of course, and general relativity with its dark matter
and cosmological constant may be disestablished, but that seems quite unlikely. The
establishment of a better theory of how these hypothetical components ﬁt into the
rest of physics, perhaps within an extension of the standard model for particle physics,
perhaps in a generalization of general relativity, would be most welcome, of course,
and seems likely, because this has been the normal course of events in the history of
physics.

7 Lessons

This discussion of developments in the empirical exploration of gravity in the 1950s
and 1960s oﬀers lessons to be considered. Some are largely of historical interest, in
some cases because there no longer is much low-hanging fruit. But some lessons are
of broader signiﬁcance, and are conveniently examined in some detail in the history
of the naissance of gravity physics because the subject was such a small science then.

7.1 Nonempirical Evidence and Empirical Surprises

To be discussed here are two aspects of the story of how gravity physics grew during
the naissance. The ﬁrst is the productive power of the concepts of logic and elegance
advocated by inﬂuential scientists informed by previously successful advances in sci-
ence. It may instead be termed the role of standard and accepted belief systems.
The second is the productive power of empirical evidence, which can surprise us on
occasion, and force revisions of our belief systems.

In 1915 there was only one seriously demanding test of general relativity theory,
from the motion of the planet Mercury, which orbits the Sun at roughly 1013 cm. The
situation was little improved in 1955. But a half century after that Einstein’s theory
has proved to pass a demanding network of tests on scales ranging from the labora-
o ∼ 1028 cm, as
tory to the edge of the observable universe, at the Hubble length H−1
illustrated in Figure 11. The latter is an extrapolation of ﬁfteen orders of magnitude
in length scale from the best evidence Einstein had, and the former, down to labo-
ratory scales, is a similarly enormous extrapolation. The present successes of these
extrapolations of a theory discovered a century ago is a deeply impressive example of
the power of nonempirical evidence. But not all elegant ideas can be productive, of
course. I oﬀer three examples drawn from this story of the naissance of experimental
gravity physics.

The distribution and motion of the mass around us has been shown to aﬀect local
inertial motion, and it has seemed natural to some to imagine that other aspects of
how local physics operates might also be related to what is happening in the rest
of the universe. We have an excellent empirical case that our universe is expanding
and cooling from a very hot dense early state, and it has seemed natural to some to
look for evolution of how local physics operates, perhaps to be described by evolution
of the values of its parameters. Perhaps clock rates deﬁned by molecules, atoms, or
atomic nuclei that are small enough that tidal stresses may be ignored, and adequately
shielded from electromagnetic ﬁelds, cosmic rays, and all that, may vary with position
or motion or cosmic evolution. As discussed in Section 4, this holistic concept has
inspired some to think of an eﬀective aether; some to think of Mach’s Principle;
Jordan to introduce a scalar-tensor theory that would express Dirac’s Large Numbers
Hypothesis; and Dicke to think of this scalar-tensor theory as expressing both the
LNH and Mach’s Principle. This holistic concept led Einstein to his prediction of
the large-scale homogeneity of the universe. If Einstein had consulted astronomers he
would have received no encouragement, but the observable universe proves to agree
with his thinking. But although this thinking, which Einstein so successfully applied,
has continued to seem beautiful to some, it has not led to anything of substance since
Einstein. The searching tests reviewed in Section 6 agree with the idea that local
physics, including gravitation, is quite unaﬀected by what the rest of the universe is
doing.

For a second example consider the opinion of inﬂuential physicists in the 1950s that
the cosmological constant Λ is inelegant if not absurd. (The situation was reviewed
in Peebles and Ratra 2003, §III.) The power of this thinking is seen in the preference
for the relativistic Einstein-de Sitter cosmological model, with Λ = 0 and negligible
mean space curvature, in the 1980s through the 1990s. The ﬁrst clear evidence that
the observed galaxy peculiar velocities are smaller than expected in the Einstein-de
Sitter model, if the space distribution of matter is fairly traced by the observed dis-
tribution of the galaxies (Davis and Peebles 1983), was countered by the hypothesis
that the galaxy space distribution is signiﬁcantly more clumpy than the mass (the
consequences of which for the evolution of cosmic structure were ﬁrst examined by
Davis, Efstathiou, Frenk, and White 1985). This biasing picture agrees with the ob-
served greater clustering of the rare most massive galaxies, but it is not naturally

Will be inserted by the editor

55

consistent with the quite similar distributions of the far more abundant normal and
dwarf galaxies seen in the CfA galaxy redshift survey maps (Davis, Huchra, Latham,
and Tonry 1982, Figs. 2a and 2d). By the arguments summarized in Peebles (1986),
the biasing picture was a nonempirical postulate meant to save the Einstein-de Sit-
ter model. Some (including de Vaucouleurs 1982; Peebles 1986; Brown and Peebles
1987; Peebles, Daly, and Juszkiewicz 1989; and Bahcall and Cen 1992) took seriously
the growing empirical evidence that, assuming general relativity theory, either Λ or
space curvature diﬀers from zero. But the title of a paper adding to this evidence,
The baryon content of galaxy clusters: a challenge to cosmological orthodoxy (White,
Navarro, Evrard, and Frenk 1993), illustrates the general reluctance to abandon the
orthodox Einstein-de Sitter cosmology.

The preference for negligible large-scale space curvature was largely inspired by
the inﬂation picture of the early universe, which in some scenarios is meant to account
for the observed large-scale homogeneity by exceedingly rapid expansion of the early
universe that might have stretched out and thus suppressed observable departures
from homogeneity, and with it would have suppressed space curvature. This preference
now proves to agree with stringent bounds on the mean space curvature (Planck
Collaboration 2015b, §6.2.4, and references therein). It is another impressive success
for nonempirical evidence. But the empirical evidence is that we must learn to live
with Λ (or something in the stress-energy tensor that acts like it), even though (as
discussed later in this subsection) its numerical value is nonzero but absurdly small
compared to natural estimates from quantum physics.

For the third example, consider Mandelbrot’s (1975) argument that the galaxy
space distribution may be a fractal. (In a simple fractal distribution, particles are
placed in clusters, the clusters placed in clusters of clusters, the clusters of clusters
in clusters of clusters of clusters, and so on up.) The mathematics of fractals is
elegant, and there are interesting applications. Thus Mandelbrot explained that the
measured length of the coastline of Brittany depends on the length resolution used to
make the measurement. And Mandelbrot took note of de Vaucouleurs’ (1970) point,
that the galaxy distribution in surveys then available certainly resembled a fractal.
This line of argument, if more widely pursued earlier, could have had the beneﬁcial
eﬀect of driving observational tests. But as it happened, interest in the elegance of a
fractal universe started to grow just as empirical evidence for Einstein’s large-scale
homogeneity was at last emerging (as discussed in Sec. 6.13, and reviewed by Jones,
Mart´ınez, Saar, and Trimble 2004).

Elegant ideas tend to be lasting. The Steady State cosmology is elegant, as is the
fractal concept, and the two arguably ﬁnd their places in the multiverse of eternal
inﬂation. The role of the scalar ﬁeld that Jordan and Dicke envisioned is now seen to
be at most an exceedingly subdominant eﬀect at low redshifts, but the possible role of
scalar ﬁelds in gravity physics still is discussed, in superstring theories (Uzan 2003), in
models for inﬂation, and in the search for a deeper cosmological model (Joyce, Jain,
Khoury, and Trodden (2015), including the scalar-tensor theory and the notion that
the cosmological constant Λ in the present standard cosmology may be an approxi-
mation to the energy of a slowly evolving scalar dark energy ﬁeld (Peebles and Ratra
1988, who referred back to Dicke’s thinking about the slow evolution of the strength
of gravity). The very weak strength of the gravitational interaction is still discussed,
now under the name of the gauge hierarchy issue. The idea that the gravitational
interaction has been growing weaker as the universe expands, which so greatly in-
terested Dirac, Jordan, and Dicke (Secs. 4 and 6.10), still is explored (Secs. 6.10.2
and 6.12). Also still explored is the possible evolution of the ﬁne-structure constant,
as exempliﬁed by equation (16), and the other dimensionless physical parameters,
though now inspired largely by issues of completion of quantum physics (as reviewed
by Uzan 2003).

Another older issue of completeness is the considerable diﬀerence between the rel-
ativistic constraint on the vacuum energy density, to be represented by the value of
Einstein’s cosmological constant if the vacuum is invariant under Lorentz transfor-
mations, and simple estimates of the sum of energies of the ﬁelds of particle physics.
Early thinking was reviewed in Peebles and Ratra (2003, Sec. B.3). In particular,
Rugh and Zinkernagel (2002) recalled Wolfgang Pauli’s recognition in the 1930s that
the zero-point energies of matter particles certainly are real, required to account
for measured binding energies, but that the zero-point energies of the modes of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld present a problem. In the English translation (Pauli 1980) of
Pauli’s (1933) Die allgemeinen Prinzipien der Wellenmechanik, Pauli wrote that, in
the quantization of the electromagnetic ﬁeld,

ωr per degree of freedom need not be introduced here,
a zero-point energy of 1
2
in contrast to the material oscillator. For . . . this would lead to an inﬁnitely
large energy per unit volume because of the inﬁnite number of degrees of
freedom of the system . . . Also, as is obvious from experience, it does not
produce any gravitational ﬁeld.

The zero-point energy of each mode of a matter ﬁeld, which is computed by the same
quantum physics, must be real to account for measured binding energies, but these
zero-point energies also add up to a absurdly large — negative for fermions — mean
vacuum energy density. This curious situation was discussed in passing in Gravity
Group meetings, but not to the point of publishing, because we did not know what to
make of it. Zel’dovich (1968) published, and pointed out that the vacuum energy likely
appears in the form of Einstein’s cosmological constant, though with an apparently
absurd value. Zel’dovich’s paper was visible enough, and the issue for gravity physics
and quantum physics deep enough, to be entered in the timeline as line 37.

Another organizing concept for which one might claim nonempirical evidence, the
Anthropic Principle, oﬀers the thought that we live in an element of a multiverse, or
in a part of a really extended universe, in which the sum of zero-point energies, latent
heats, and whatever else contributes to the vacuum energy density, happens to be
small enough to allow life as we know it. The earlier version of this line of thinking
that we heard during the naissance was that the age of the expanding universe has to
be on the order of 1010 years, to allow time for a few generations of stars to produce
the heavy elements of which we are made, but not so much time that most of the
stars suitable for hosting life on a planet like Earth have exhausted their supply of
nuclear fuel and died (Dicke 1961b). The resolution of the vacuum energy puzzle by
the nonempirical evidence of the Anthropic Principle is considered elegant by some,
ugly by others, a healthy situation in the exploration of a serious problem.

7.2 Prepared and Unprepared Minds

It is observable in this history that “chance favors the prepared mind” (in an English
translation of the thought attributed to Pasteur). Consider, for example, how quickly
Pound and Rebka turned the announcement of M¨ossbauer’s eﬀect into a laboratory
detection of the gravitational redshift (Sec. 2). In his recollections Pound (2000) men-
tioned Singer’s (1956) discussion of how an atomic clock in an artiﬁcial satellite might
be used to detect the gravitational redshift. Pound recalled that he and Rebka recog-
nized that the M¨ossbauer eﬀect presented an opportunity and “a challenge; namely,
to ﬁnd a way to use it to measure relativistic phenomena, as I had wanted to do
with atomic clocks; however, the clocks had not proved suﬃciently stable.” Dicke’s
letter to Pound (Sec 6.2) showed that when Pound and Rebka (1959) announced their
intention to do this experiment at least two other groups were working on it too. We

Will be inserted by the editor

57

see that minds were well prepared for this experiment. Wilson and Kaiser (2014)
considered how Shapiro’s thinking about planetary radar ranging experiments helped
prepare his mind for the measurement of the relativistic eﬀect on the time delay of
planetary radar pulses that pass near the Sun (Sec. 6.4). Dicke was prepared and
searching for probes of gravity physics: As NASA was learning to ﬂy rockets Dicke
and his group were exploring how to use this new space technology for precision mea-
surements of the orbits of satellites, perhaps by tracking angular positions of corner
reﬂectors illuminated by searchlights, and then, when the technology allowed it, turn-
ing to pulsed or continuous wave lasers for precision ranging to corner reﬂectors on
the Moon. The results, after considerably more work, had an intended consequence,
the production of demanding tests of gravity physics. For Dicke, of course, an unin-
tended consequence was a much tighter bound on evolution of the strength of gravity
than he had expected.

We may consider also an example of a situation in which minds were not prepared.
The research by Gamow and colleagues in the late 1940s, on element formation in the
early stages of expansion of a hot Big Bang cosmology, has grown into a demanding
set of tests of gravity physics (as reviewed in Sec. 6.13.3). Gamow (1953) outlined
this research in lectures at the Ann Arbor Symposium on Astrophysics. But I have
not found any mention of the research by Gamow’s group in the proceedings of the
four international conferences on general relativity and gravitation that have been
discussed in this history: Bern in 1955, Chapel Hill in 1957, Royaumont in 1959, and
NASA in 1961. There is no mention of it in the proceedings of the next conference
in this series, the July 1962 Warszawa and Jablonna Conf´erence internationale sur
les th´eories relativiste de la gravitation (Infeld 1964), there is no mention in two IAU
Symposia where it might have ﬁgured: the Paris Symposium on Radio Astronomy,
July 1958 (Bracewell 1959), and Problems of Extra-galactic Research, Berkeley Cal-
ifornia, August 1961 (McVittie 1962), and no mention in the Solvay Conference on
Cosmology, Brussels 1958 (Stoops 1958). Bondi’s (1952, 1960) book, Cosmology, which
was the best review of research in cosmology during the naissance of experimental
gravity, gave references to papers on element formation by Gamow’s group, in a list of
papers for further reading, but there was no discussion of these ideas in the text. We
may conclude that, until 1965, the leading ﬁgures in relativity and cosmology were
not prepared for this development: They did not know about Gamow’s (1948) ideas
or else they were not prepared to consider them promising.

Donald Osterbrock attended Gamow’s (1953) Ann Arbor lectures, found them
interesting, and remembered the idea of helium production in a hot Big Bang (Oster-
brock 2009). Geoﬀrey Burbidge also was at the Ann Arbor conference, and Burbidge
(1958) later commented on the evidence that the helium abundance in our galaxy is
larger than might be expected from production is stars. He did not mention Gamow’s
thinking, however: If he attended Gamow’s lectures he had forgotten them, or found
them unpromising. Osterbrock and Rogerson (1961) added to the evidence for a large
helium abundance in the Milky Way, even in the apparently older stars that have
lower abundances of heavier elements, and pointed out that “the build-up of elements
to helium can be understood without diﬃculty in the explosive formation picture.”
Their reference was to Gamow (1949). This is the ﬁrst published announcement of a
possible detection of a fossil from a hot early stage of expansion of the universe. It re-
ceived no signiﬁcant notice. Hoyle and Tayler (1964), apparently independently, also
announced the possible signiﬁcance for cosmology of the large cosmic helium abun-
dance. We cannot know how this paper would have been received if another candidate
remnant from a hot early universe, the sea of microwave radiation, had not been an-
nounced at close to the same time. This radiation was ﬁrst detected, as anomalous
noise in microwave telecommunications experiments, at the Bell Telephone labora-
tories (Sec. 6.13.2). Engineers were aware of the anomaly by 1959. In 1964 Penzias

58

The European Physical Journal H

and Wilson had a good case that the anomalous noise could not be instrumental or
terrestrial. But their minds were not prepared for cosmology until they learned of the
search for fossil microwave radiation by Dicke’s Gravity Research Group.

The announcement by Dicke, Peebles, Roll, and Wilkinson (1965), that the Bell
communications experiments might have detected a sea of radiation left from the hot
early universe, received abundant attention. The announcement by Osterbrock and
Rogerson (1961) that the abundance of helium is larger than expected because it too
is a remnant from the hot early universe received little notice. For experimentalists the
former was the more interesting development, because one could set about measuring
the radiation spectrum and angular distribution. But both were fascinating hints to
cosmic evolution. Perhaps those who study the sociology of science are best positioned
to explore why the presence of more microwave radiation than expected from known
radio sources received so much more attention than the presence of more helium than
expected from production in known stars. The rest of us might bear in mind that
nature is quite capable of surprising us.

7.3 Speculative and Programmatic Experiments

This history presents us with examples of experiments that were purely speculative,
done simply because they were possible; experiments that were inspired by ideas such
as those just discussed that were speculative according to accepted ideas but seemed
attractive in other philosophies; and experiments that may be termed programmatic:
designed to ﬁnd what was expected from standard and accepted ideas.

A good illustration of the ﬁrst, speculative, class is the experimental test of equiv-
alence of active and passive gravitational masses (Sec. 6.7). Discovery of a violation
would be shocking, but one must consider that during the naissance little was known
about empirical gravity physics, and such purely speculative experiments were well
worth doing to help improve the situation. It is regrettable that it would be diﬃcult
now to ﬁnd support for a more precise laboratory test. Physics should be challenged.
The second class includes the tests for sensitivity of local physics to what the rest
of the universe is doing. Some of these experiments were inspired by thoughts of a
luminiferous aether of some sort, others by thoughts of Mach’s Principle and Dirac’s
Large Numbers Hypothesis. Explorations of these ideas motivated experiments that
have informed us about the nature of gravity. Consider, for example, Dicke’s fascina-
tion with the idea that the strength of the gravitational interaction may be evolving,
and that precision tracking of the orbit of the Moon might reveal the eﬀect. Without
Dicke’s persistence and inﬂuence, would NASA, and its counterpart in the Soviet
Union, have gone to the trouble of placing corner reﬂectors on the Moon? We cannot
answer, of course, but we do see how elegant ideas may lead to great results, as in
the demanding tests of gravity physics from the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment.

I place in the third, programmatic, class of experiments during the naissance the
measurements of gravitational redshift and deﬂection of light, and the search for
tensor gravitational waves. This is the delicate art of ﬁnding what one expects to
ﬁnd (Hetherington 1980). One might argue that when these experiments were done
during the naissance they belonged to the second class, because they were inspired by
a theory that was not empirically well supported. The distinction is that the theory
was broadly accepted, on nonempirical grounds. But empirical evidence is far better,
in the philosophy of science as exploration of the world around us. The programmatic
searches for what general relativity theory predicts have been deeply important to
this empirical establishment.

As gravity physics grew the distribution of experiments among the three classes
evolved, from considerable activity on the purely speculative side during the naissance

Will be inserted by the editor

59

to the present emphasis on the programmatic side, now that we have a well-established
theory that tells us what to look for. This programmatic side is essential to the
experimental gravity physics program, but it is not minor pedantry now to pursue
experiments designed to be sensitive to departures from the standard model, such
as checks of equivalence of the four masses deﬁned in equation (13), or tests of the
gravitational inverse square law (e.g. Adelberger, Gundlach, Heckel, et al. 2009), or
searches for cosmic evolution of physical parameters such as ratios of elementary
particle masses and the strengths of the fundamental interactions. All our physical
theories are incomplete, the world is large, and it has ample opportunities to surprise
us yet again.

7.4 General Purpose and Purpose-Built Instruments

The pendulums usually seen in teaching laboratories for measurements of the acceler-
ation, g, of gravity look very diﬀerent from the ones illustrated in Figure 5 and used
in the Hoﬀmann (1962) and Curott (1965) experiments to probe possible evolution
of g. They look very diﬀerent again from the sketch in Figure 9 of Faller’s (1963)
falling corner reﬂector experiment to measure the absolute value of g. These Prince-
ton experiments, and the two versions of the E¨otv¨os experiment (Liebes 1963; Roll,
Krotkov, and Dicke 1964), were designed, or we may say purpose-built, to be optimum
for a speciﬁc measurement. The Pound and Rebka (1959) laboratory measurement
of the gravitational redshift was a purpose-built experiment too, one inspired by a
new tool, the M¨ossbauer eﬀect, which made it possible. The Princeton E¨otv¨os exper-
iments, the probes of the evolution of g, and the measurement of its absolute value,
certainly made heavy use of available tools, but they could have been done a decade
earlier, though, I am informed, distinctly less well, or a decade later, and better. They
are examples of experiments that awaited someone to act on the idea that a closer
examination of a particular issue is worth doing, perhaps by design of a purpose-built
experiment.

At Gravity Research Group meetings Dicke explained his dislike of sharing raw
experimental data that others could reanalyze in foolish ways. The closest he came to
Big Data was in the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment, but it is to be observed that as
that project grew he withdrew. Big Data now is an important part of gravity physics,
as in precision measurements of the CMB, and in the establishment of precision
statistical measures of the natures and distributions of the galaxies. Dicke perhaps
could not have anticipated the power of the “data mining” in modern observational
surveys that can challenge unexamined ideas. But there still is a good case for his
preference for an experiment designed for optimum examination of a speciﬁc issue.
For example, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Alam, Albareti, Allende, et al. 2015 and
references therein) has made wonderfully broad contributions to our knowledge of
the statistical properties of galaxies, but of course it was not designed to explore all
properties. An example is the spiral galaxies in which only a small fraction of the
observed stars rise well above the disk (Kormendy, Drory, Bender, and Cornell 2010).
Such galaxies are common nearby, and they are a fascinating challenge for theories of
galaxy formation based on the ΛCDM cosmology, because of the predicted tendency
of galaxies to grow by merging that would tend to place stars in orbits that rise
well above the disk. Further exploration of this interesting phenomenon might best
be served by an observational program designed for optimum examination of the
properties of this particular class of galaxies.

7.5 Support for Curiosity-Driven Research

The ﬁnancial support for speculative curiosity-driven research during the naissance
in experimental gravity physics is worth recalling, because science and society have
changed. Dicke and his Gravity Research Group were supported in part by the United
States National Science Foundation, and in part also by the United States Army Sig-
nal Corps in the late 1950s, by the Oﬃce of Naval Research of the United States
Navy through the 1960s, and in some papers one also sees acknowledgement of sup-
port by the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission. The Hoﬀmann, Krotkov, and Dicke
(1960) proposal for precision tracking of satellites was published in the journal IRE
Transactions on Military Electronics; the ﬁrst paper in the issue, by Rear Admiral
Rawson Bennett, USN, opened with the sentence “This issue . . . is devoted to the
United States Navy’s interest and eﬀort in space electronics.” The military certainly
had reason to be interested in space electronics, but surely had no interest in the Hoﬀ-
mann et al. proposal to test the idea that the strength of gravity may be changing
on a time scale of 1010 years. But the military seemed to be comfortable supporting
what Dicke and his group wanted to investigate.

This situation was not unusual: High energy physics papers often acknowledged
support from military agencies. In experimental gravity physics the development of
the maser used in the Cedarholm et al. (1958) aether drift test (Sec. 6.2) was sup-
ported “jointly by the Signal Corps, the Oﬃce of Naval Research, and the Air Research
and Development Command.” The Pound and Rebka (1960) laboratory detection of
the gravitational redshift (Sec. 6.4) acknowledged support “in part by the joint pro-
gram of the oﬃce of Naval Research and the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission and
by a grant from the Higgins Scientiﬁc Trust.” Irwin Shapiro, then at the MIT Lincoln
Laboratory, recalled (Shapiro 2015) that application of his new test of general relativ-
ity by planetary radar ranging (Sec. 6.4) required a more powerful transmitter, and
that after due deliberation the director of Lincoln Laboratory “called up an Air Force
general, who provided Lincoln Laboratory with funding, and asked him for $500,000,
which he then granted, for a new transmitter to enable Lincoln to carry out the ex-
periment.” This substantial ﬁnancial contribution allowed a substantial advance in
gravity physics. Wilson and Kaiser (2014) analyzed how the planetary radar exper-
iments by Shapiro and colleagues contributed to the US military research eﬀort to
detect and perhaps somehow learn to deal with an incoming USSR intercontinental
ballistic missile. But Shapiro (2015) recalled that the military did not make any at-
tempt to guide directions of the research by him and his colleagues on testing general
relativity theory. That also was the experience in Dicke’s Gravity Research Group.

The thinking by military funding agencies at this time seems to have been that
this curiosity-driven research did not cost much, perhaps apart from exceptional cases
such as Shapiro’s transmitter, could do no harm, might lead to something of eventual
value to society and the military, and perhaps also might help the military stay
in contact with people whose expertise and advice they might seek on occasion. The
permissive attitude of military funding agencies to speculative research had the result
that in Dicke’s group new directions of research often were pursued and the results
then reported to the funding agencies, without prior approval of a well-reasoned
motivation. This has changed: Compare Dicke’s invitation to his graduate student
Jim Faller to make an absolute measurement of “little g” (Sec. 6.9) to the recent US
National Science Foundation invitation to propose a measurement of “Big G”.11 The
evolution of directions of thinking from bottom-up toward top-down is natural in a
maturing science, though disturbing from the standpoint of innovative thinking. In the
1950s and 1960s the scant empirical basis for gravity physics made it very appropriate

Will be inserted by the editor

61

to pursue the speculative curiosity-driven experiments the military agencies were
inclined to support. But the 1970 Mansﬁeld Amendment ended this by prohibiting the
Defense Department from funding “any research project or study unless such project
or study has a direct and apparent relationship to a speciﬁc military function.” The
last of the Gravity Research Group papers to acknowledge support from the ONR
was published in 1972. And the arteries of natural science hardened a little.

7.6 Unintended Consequences of Curiosity-driven Research

Pure curiosity-driven research has had such great unplanned consequences that cus-
tom may obscure recognition. So let us remember Dicke’s invitation to Jim Faller to
measure the acceleration of gravity by dropping a corner reﬂector (Sec. 6.9), which
grew into technology to measure changes in water table levels and the continental re-
bound from the last Ice Age. Remember also Dicke’s interest in probing the physics of
temporal and spatial variation of the strength of gravity, and probes for gravitational
waves, which led him to invite Bill Hoﬀmann and David Curott to design pendulums
suited for the purpose, and Barry Block, Bob Moore, and Rai Weiss to do the same
with spring-type (LaCoste) gravimeters. Section 6.6 recalls how this contributed to
the Global Seismographic Network that monitors phenomena of practical interest to
us all: earthquakes, tsunamis, storm surges, and underground explosions.

Of course, a good deal of curiosity-driven research serves only to satisfy curiosity.
The Global Seismographic Network oﬀers measures of the internal structure of the
Earth, which certainly is interesting, though perhaps most satisfying to the curiosity
of specialists. John Wheeler was fascinated by “thought experiments” that illustrate
the curious apparently acausal nature of quantum physics. He discussed this at an
Einstein Centennial Address delivered at the University of Maryland in 1979, on the
centenary of Einstein’s birth. Bill Wickes and Carroll Alley were in the audience.
Wickes (1972) had completed his thesis with Dicke toward the end of the naissance;
Alley’s research with Dicke is reviewed in Sections 6.4 and 6.10.2. Wickes (2016)
recalled that

Carroll and I independently realized that we could actually do Wheeler’s
double-slit delayed choice experiment, using some of the lasers and fast-switching
methods that Carroll had pioneered for the lunar ranging work. So we joined
forces and recruited Oleg Jakubowicz to do the work for his Ph.D. thesis . . . I
like to think of the whole project as an elegant intersection of Wheeler’s imag-
ination and Dicke’s practical tutelage.

This story of how a Wheeler “thought experiment” became a real experiment is told
in Wheeler and Ford (1998, pp 336-338). Quantum physics is not really acausal: It
does not allow you to foresee movements of the stock market, even in principle. But
it is satisfying to see real experimental demonstrations of the well-advertised non-
intuitive nature of quantum physics, even to non-specialists who take an interest in
the world around us. And it is to be observed that many who are not involved in
research in natural science ﬁnd it satisfying to know that Einstein’s general relativity
theory of gravity, which he discovered a century ago, has been experimentally shown
to be a good approximation to how gravity actually operates.

7.7 Establishing and Disestablishing Elements of Natural Science

It is challenging if not impossible to deﬁne the scientiﬁc method. A working philosophy
common in the physics and astronomy communities, and adopted in this paper, is

62

The European Physical Journal H

that a theory is established to be a good and useful approximation if it agrees with
substantially more lines of evidence than the number used to guide construction of the
theory added to the free parameters available to adjust the theory to ﬁt new evidence.
An established theory may be disestablished by disagreement with new empirical
evidence, but the common experience has been that the theory becomes a limiting
case of a better theory. This philosophy allows that there may be diﬀerent established
theories of the same phenomena, but experience is that this seldom happens. Deﬁning
the meaning of reality is ﬁnessed by taking it to be what is established by the progress
of science, in successive approximations. In this philosophy no position need be taken
on whether there is a ﬁnal theory or it is successive approximations all the way down.
We do not have a guarantee that nature operates in such a way that this program is
viable, but the success so far is manifest: consider the immense varieties of practical
applications of established natural sciences.

There are many ideas about how to decide on additions to the established canon.
Dawid (2015) wrote that Einstein’s general relativity “had been conﬁrmed empirically
by Eddington’s measurement of starlight bending in 1919.” Although the measure-
ment was dubious it was indeed greeted by the media as a great triumph for Einstein’s
theory, which perhaps is what Dawid had in mind. Hetherington (1980) took the in-
correct conﬁrmation of an incorrect prediction of the gravitational redshift of the
white dwarf star Sirius B (reviewed in Sec. 6.4) to exemplify the astronomers’ “ﬁnd-
ing too facilely what they expected to ﬁnd.” We might add as another example of
this hazard Eddington’s claimed detection of the predicted gravitational deﬂection
of light, which was a dubious measurement. The hazard certainly is not conﬁned to
astronomy: I imagine the tendency to ﬁnd the expected is common to all human en-
deavor. The experimental community may be better conditioned now to mitigate the
hazard, by what might otherwise seem to be excessively compulsive attention to tests
of reproducibility and checks of consistency of constraints derived from independent
lines of evidence.

Might another great advance in experimental gravity physics empirically establish
inﬂation or some other picture of what was happening in the very early universe,
before classical relativity could have been a good approximation? Consider that in the
mid 1950s general relativity theory was widely accepted as logically compelling, while
now inﬂation is widely accepted as a promising, even logically compelling, scenario
for what was happening in the very early universe. There is the serious diﬀerence that
general relativity is a theory, while inﬂation is a framework on which to hang a theory.
There is the serious similarity that in the mid-1950s the experimental basis for general
relativity was considered to be necessarily schematic, because better experiments were
not feasible, and now the basis for inﬂation is considered to be necessarily schematic,
for the same reason. If there really are few feasible empirical tests of early universe
physics, then we will have to rely on the nonempirical assessment of evidence from
elegance and logical completeness. But the scientiﬁc community was surprised by what
grew out of the naissance in empirical gravity physics in the 1960s, as it has been
surprised by many other advances in the natural sciences. This experience suggests
that we may expect more to come, perhaps even some that postpone the need for
nonempirical assessment of some future deeper theory of the nature of gravity.

I have greatly beneﬁtted from recollections, guidance to the literature, and advice on the
preparation of this paper, from Eric Adelberger, Pete Bender, Jon Berger, Bart Bernstein,
Steve Boughn, Paul Boynton, Richard Dawid, Dieter Brill, David Curott, Jim Faller, Masa-

Masataka Fukugita, Bruce Partridge, Irwin Shapiro, and Virginia Trimble, for their careful
reading and annotated commentaries of drafts; Dieter Brill, for his notes of what was said
at Gravity Group meetings; Sid Liebes, who made the drawing of the interferometer on the
left side of Figure 4; and Bill Hoﬀmann, who had in his possession the drawing of the inter-
ferometer in Figure 9, and who made the ﬁrst draft of the tables in the Appendix. I must
also thank Linda Chamberlin for guiding me through the vast but not always well organized
resources of the Princeton University Library. This research was supported through the good
oﬃces of the Department of Physics, Princeton University.
Appendix: working with Dicke
Examples of research in Dicke’s Gravity Reseaarch Group were discussed in Sections 5
and 6. This Appendix is meant to give a broader picture by listing all Dicke’s PhD
graduate students and all the post-PhD members of his Gravity Research Group for
whom I have records. (I would be grateful to receive information about anyone I have
overlooked or misidentiﬁed.) The dissertation titles are recorded in order to illustrate
Dicke’s quite abrupt mid-career change of direction to gravity physics.

Table 1A lists the pre-gravity PhD theses Dicke directed, with title and year of
acceptance of the thesis by the Princeton Department of Physics. The compilation of
Table 2A, on research in the Gravity Group, required somewhat more creative rules. A
graduate student who completed a PhD under Dicke’s direction is marked as PhD in
the second column, and the third column gives the thesis title and date of acceptance.
Some graduate students published papers in addition to their dissertations while
they were group members, and some stayed in the group as postdocs, but none of
this information is entered. Those who joined the group as a postdoc, instructor, or
assistant professor are marked as post-PhDs in the second column. The third column
in this case lists the title and reference for the ﬁrst publication reporting research
done in the group (but excluding multiple-author papers that are already in the
table.) Some titles are shortened to ﬁt. A more complete picture would list visitors,
some of whom stayed for a day or two, perhaps to present a seminar, and others
stayed longer, but I do know of reasonably complete records. Dicke’s publications

but almost all of his papers on gravity are discussed in the text.

Some entries in Table 2A require special explanation. Dicke advised Lawrence
Cathles’s 1965 Princeton undergraduate paper on The physics of glacial uplift. Cathles
wrote his PhD thesis on deeper exploration of the same subject, in the Princeton
Department of Geological and Geophysical Sciences, under the direction of Jason
Morgan, who wrote his PhD thesis under Dicke’s direction in the Department of
Physics. Apart from this case, the undergraduate papers and theses Dicke directed are
not entered. While Henry Hill was in the gravity group he directed Carl Zanoni’s 1957
PhD research, which is entered. Curtis Callan was most closely associated with Sam
Treiman’s research in elementary particle theory, but Dicke proposed and supervised
his dissertation. Wheeler supervised Dieter Brill’s 1959 PhD thesis, but Brill often
attended Gravity Group meetings, and he wrote a 1962 review of experimental tests
of relativity with Bob Krotkov, who was in the Gravity Group, and Bruno Bertotti,
who was visiting the group.
