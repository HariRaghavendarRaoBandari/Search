The strange correlator [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 247202 (2014)] has been proposed as a measure of symmetry
protected topological order in one- and two-dimensional systems. It takes the form of a spin-spin correlation
function, computed as a mixed overlap between the state of interest and a trivial local product state. We demon-
strate that it can be computed exactly (asymptotically, in the Monte Carlo sense) for various Afﬂeck-Kennedy-
Lieb-Tasaki states by direct evaluation of the wave function within the valence bond loop gas framework. We
present results for lattices with chain, square, honeycomb, cube, diamond, and hyperhoneycomb geometries.
In each case, the spin quantum number S is varied such that 2S (the number of valence bonds emerging from
each site) achieves various integer multiples of the lattice coordination number. We introduce the concept of
strange correlator loop winding number and point to its utility in testing for the presence of symmetry protected
topological order.

INTRODUCTION

The classiﬁcation of topological phases of matter is in-
creasingly well understood.1 We now know that, in addition
to states with intrinsic topological order2—which cannot be
smoothly connected to any local product state3—there are
those that exhibit a weaker form of topological order. These
so-called symmetry protected topological (SPT) states4,5 are
also incompatible with any local-product-state description,
but only insofar as a special protecting symmetry remains un-
broken.

SPT states are gapped and featureless in the bulk, and they
are short-range entangled. They share few of the exotic fea-
tures of their intrinsically ordered cousins. For instance, they
do not support fractional excitations;6 nor do they possess
topological ground state degeneracy7 (i.e., they have unique
ground states on closed manifolds). Nonetheless, nontrivial
SPT states do possess interesting boundary modes, which in
low-dimensional systems must either be gapless or sponta-
neously break a symmetry. (Beginning in three spatial dimen-
sions, topologically degenerate boundary modes offer a third
possibility.8) In general, the wave function at the boundary ad-
mits projective representations of the protecting symmetries.
The Haldane chain is a well-known example of an SPT state
in one dimension, where the spin-1 degrees of freedom in the
bulk fractionalize into spin-1/2 at the boundary;9 there, the
projective representations are SU(2) in the case of SO(3) sym-
metry and T 2 = −1 in the case of time reversal symmetry.

The concept of SPT phases was ﬁrst developed in the con-
text of noninteracting fermions, and an exhaustive classiﬁca-
tion10,11 was soon worked out following the discovery of topo-
logical insulators. In the presence of interactions, however,
the story is more complicated. For example, in the case of
spinless fermions in one dimension with time-reversal invari-
ance and particle-number conservation, interactions reduce
the group structure from Z down to Z8;12,13 for bosons, the
group structure must enlarge, since noninteracting bosons ulti-
mately condense into a single phase. There is ongoing work to
classify SPT phases for general interacting quantum systems.
For fermions, there is a proposal to apply group supercoho-

mology theory.14 Classiﬁcation of interacting bosonic systems
has been attempted using group cohomology15 and nonlinear
sigma models augmented by topological theta terms.16

Much progress has been made already in the special case
of one spatial dimension, where gapped SPT phases can be
described by matrix product states17,18 and their characteriza-
tion given by a generalization of string order. But in two or
more dimensions, string order is ill-deﬁned, and such a classi-
ﬁcation scheme is not possible. Some promising approaches
include universal signatures in the entanglement spectrum19
and the braiding statistics of topological excitations in the cor-
responding “gauged” intrinsic topological state.20 Recent pro-
posals extend to the geometric properties of reduced density
matrices21 and the analysis of modular matrices.22 However,
these approaches are computationally costly and impractical
outside of exact diagonalization, density matrix renormaliza-
tion group, matrix product state, and tensor network methods.
An intriguing alternative has been suggested by You et al.,
who introduced a “strange correlator” that effectively maps
spatio-temporal correlations at the physical boundary of an
SPT phase to spatial correlations at a temporal boundary with
a trivial symmetric product state.23 Because the modes at the
physical boundary are either gapless or degenerate, in one and
two dimensions (1D and 2D) they must be either critical or
ordered (because of spontaneous symmetry breaking at the
boundary). Thus, the strange correlator will show exponential
decay for trivial symmetric states but long-range or power-law
behavior for nontrivial SPT states. This understanding has
been conﬁrmed in studies of Afﬂeck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki
(AKLT) states in 1D and 2D,23 spin-1 Heisenberg chains and
ladders,24 quasi-1D arrays of Haldane chains,25 and quantum
spin Hall states in the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model.26

The basic idea of the strange correlator is to map the
imaginary-time Green’s function of a spatial boundary onto
the equal-time Green’s function of a space-time boundary.23
As long as there exists an emergent Lorentz symmetry in the
low-energy effective ﬁeld theory of the SPT phase (i.e.
the
dynamical critical exponent z = 1), then this mapping is in
principle exact. Since the boundary modes of an SPT are ei-
ther gapless or degenerate, in one and two dimensions this
implies that the Green’s function must be either long-range

order or quasi-long-range order. In three dimensions, the pos-
sibility of a topologically ordered boundary mode introduces
the possibility of short-range order. Thus, in 1D and 2D, LRO
or QLRO signal a nontrivial SPT phase, while SRO signals a
symmetric product state. In 3D, LRO and QLRO still signal
a nontrivial SPT phase, but SRO no longer implies a symmet-
ric product state unless it can be shown that the boundary is
topologically trivial.

In this work, we demonstrate how to measure the strange
correlator within a generalized spin-S valence bond formal-
ism and apply this method to study AKLT states in 1D, 2D,
and 3D. The AKLT states are exact valence bond solid states
with well-known properties, and we employ them as a testbed
for new methods to characterize SPT states. In 1D our ap-
proach provides an intuitive and easy-to-visualize picture of
why the strange correlator yields long-range correlations in
spin-S AKLT chains for odd values of S. It also makes clear
a connection to the concept of valence bond winding number
sectors, as well as to the conventional string order in 1D sys-
tems. In 2D the strange correlator becomes quasi-long-range,
yet we show that the corresponding winding number fraction
remains ﬁnite. This is reminiscent of the Kosterlitz-Thouless
phase, where slow twisting of the superﬂuid order parame-
ter prevents Bose-Einstein condensation at ﬁnite temperature,
yet there still exists a ﬁnite superﬂuid fraction due to vortex
conﬁnement. Finally, in 3D we show the strange correlator is
long-range with a nonzero winding number fraction.

The remainder of the text proceeds as follows. In Sec. II
we introduce AKLT states as the exact ground states of a class
of projective Hamiltonians. We also present a generalized
valence bond formalism for spin-S degrees of freedom com-
posed of symmetrized combinations of 2S spin-1/2 particles
and show how to measure correlation functions, conventional
and strange, within this formalism. In Sec. III, we present our
results, which include a numerical evaluation of these correla-
tion functions (for various lattices and spin values) and a com-
parison to some exact results in 1D. In Sec. IV we show that
the energy excitation gap of AKLT states can be estimated by
promoting one valence bond singlet to a triplet (in the spirit of
Feynman’s single-mode approximation) and give some esti-
mates for states with S ≤ 2. Finally, in Sec. V, we summarize
our main results and discuss the outlook for future work.

II. MODEL AND METHODS

The AKLT27,28 states are prototypical examples of SPT
states in low dimension. (They have recently gained new at-
tention for their possible value in measurement-based quan-
tum computation schemes.29) The best-known example in 1D
is the Haldane chain, which is smoothly connected to an ex-
act valence bond solid state.27 By expressing its Hamiltonian
as a sum of projection operators on nearest-neighbor bonds,
one can prove that there is a unique ground state (on the pe-
riodic chain) with exponentially decaying correlations and a
gap to excitations.28 Exact results for the bilinear spin correla-
tion function of the spin-S AKLT chain have been derived on
the basis of an exact mapping from a D-dimensional AKLT

FIG. 1. (a) Each S = 1 object can be expressed as two spin-half de-
grees of freedom, fully symmetrized.
(b) The AKLT state on the
linear chain is the state with exactly one short bond connecting each
pair of nearest-neighbor spins. Here, all bonds represent singlet pairs
between sites in opposite sublattices (denoted by open and ﬁlled cir-
cles). When the two spin-half ﬂavors on each site are resolved, the
state takes the form of a superposition of 2L nonorthogonal valence
bond conﬁgurations. (c) The overlap of the AKLT state with itself
produces a gas of closed loops. This is the framework in which all
expectation values are computed, as per Ref. 37.

state to a D-dimensional model of interacting classical O(3)
spins at ﬁnite temperature.30 This mapping holds in any di-
mension and implies, via the Mermin-Wagner theorem,31 that
all AKLT states in 1D and 2D are magnetically disordered. In
3D, magnetic order is not forbidden and its presence is spe-
ciﬁc to the choice of lattice and spin value. Ordering typically
occurs above some threshold in the multiplicity of the state
(viz., the integer M = 2S/z, where z is the coordination num-
ber of the lattice). For instance, Monte Carlo simulations have
shown that AKLT states on the cubic lattice always exhibit
long-range antiferromagnetic order, whereas those on the dia-
mond lattice are ordered only if there is more than one singlet
bond per nearest-neighbor link.32

The AKLT states are the ground states of Hamiltonians of

Here, the ﬁrst sum is over nearest-neighbor pairs of sites, each

FIG. 3. Spin correlations between the constituent spin-halfs obey
the usual rules of the valence bond basis: (a) +3/4 for spin-halfs
in the same sublattice and (b) −3/4 for spin-halfs in opposite sublat-
tices, provided they reside in the same loop of the overlap graph; zero
otherwise. For mixed estimators involving the triplet product state,
the same rules apply so long as the loop spacing obeys the expected
ABAB pattern; otherwise the value is a factor 3 lower: (c) for spin-
halfs in the same sublattice, +1/4 for odd loop spacing and +3/4 for
the usual even loop spacing, and (d) in opposite sublattices, −3/4 for
the usual odd loop spacing and −1/4 for even loop spacing.

respectively.

The AKLT states are ﬁxed-point representations of valence
bond solids. To see this, it is instructive to decompose the spin
operator Si on a lattice site into 2S spin-1/2 components.27,28
In this picture, AKLT states are formed by combining the
spin-1/2 components on adjacent lattice sites into a spin sin-
glet in such a way that the number of singlets across each
nearest-neighbor link is a constant (the multiplicity). Then
the spin-1/2 components residing at each site are projected
onto the total spin-S sector.

For concreteness, we proceed by expressing each spin-S op-

erator (Si) as a sum

metric triplet of aligned spin pairs. (b) The reference state is a tensor
product of such triplets on each site, |Ω(cid:105) = ⊗i|t(cid:105)i. (c) The overlap
of the reference state with the AKLT state from Fig. 1(b) is depicted.
A special property of the 1D system is that every term in this mixed
overlap involves a single, system-spanning loop whenever |ψ(cid:105) is a
nontrivial SPT state.

and the AJ are interaction strengths of the projectors. The
AKLT state is the ground state as long as the interactions sat-
isfy AJ > 0, so in practice their precise values are arbitrary
(though they do set the energy scale for excitations). The spin
projectors P2S
J (i, j) can be given an explicit form by recog-
nizing that their effect is to eliminate all sectors in which the

The projectors can be recast in terms of Heisenberg spin inter-
= 2S(S +1) +2Si·S j. Note
that the particular terms in the denominator of Eq. (2) ensure
that the completeness relation ∑2S

J (i, j) = 1 is satisﬁed.
(Projective constructions such as this are commonplace; e.g.,
see Eq. (2) of Ref. 32 or Eq. (8) of Ref. 33. Table I gives
the projectors as a power series in the Heisenberg spin inter-
actions for S ≤ 3.) For the case of multiplicity M = 1, the
AKLT Hamiltonian takes a rather simple form with P2S

si,α · s j,β functions as a bond swap operator when the spin ﬂa-
vors reside on the same sublattice [see Refs. 34 and 35; cf.
Eqs. (4) and (13) in Ref. 36], maximal ferromagnetic align-
ment is equivalent to perfect symmetrization of the 2S spin
ﬂavors:

where g represents a ferromagnetic coupling factor between
the constituent spin-half degrees of freedom, and π labels
the (2S)! possible permutations of the ﬂavor indices (which
is what we sample in our Monte Carlo simulations). AKLT
states are obtained by applying the symmetrization above to
a ﬁxed pattern of valence bonds; namely, M valence bonds
between spin ﬂavors of nearest neighbors. As an example, in
Fig. 1 we illustrate the M = 1 AKLT state on a spin-1 chain.
Within this representation, the spin correlations of the spin-
S entities can be decomposed into the constituent spin corre-
lations of the spin-half ﬂavors,

Here, v and v(cid:48) denote bipartite37 spin-S valence bond conﬁgu-
rations, each with SN valence bonds connecting N/2 sites in
the A sublattice to N/2 sites in the B sublattice. Thus, we can

Here, εi, j takes the value +1 or −1, depending on whether
or not the sites i and j share a common sublattice label. The
quantity δi,α↔ j,β = 0,1 is a delta function that triggers when
spin ﬂavors i,α and j,β reside in the same loop. The pos-
sible outcomes for Eq. (6), in the case of a spin-1 chain, are
illustrated in Fig. 3(a) and 3(b).
Another useful result is the overlap of two valence bond
conﬁgurations, given by (cid:104)v|v(cid:48)(cid:105) = 2N(cid:96)−SN. Here, N(cid:96) is the num-
ber of loops formed in the overlap graph, which is formed by
laying conﬁguration v atop conﬁguration v(cid:48). The maximum
possible number of loops in an overlap graph is SN, which
only occurs when two valence bond conﬁgurations are identi-
cal (and hence the overlap is unity).

As we emphasized previously, symmetrization27 between
the 2S spin-half ﬂavors on a given site is equivalent to a swap
of the end points of two valence bonds. With respect to Monte
Carlo evaluation, this symmetrization is the only kind of dy-
namical ﬂuctuation one needs to account for, since the AKLT
states are realizations of otherwise static valence bond pat-
terns.

Accordingly, we have implemented the following Monte
Carlo update scheme. We sweep through the lattice, choos-
ing each spin-S degree of freedom in turn. For each spin, we
select at random a pair of spin-half ﬂavors and propose a new
conﬁguration with the end points of these two ﬂavors swapped
(see Fig. 17 in the Appendix for an illustration). The new
conﬁguration is accepted according to the ratio of the Monte
Carlo sampling weight,

. Although it is sometimes advantageous to per-
form a “walk” through the new conﬁguration to determine the
change in the number of loops in the overlap graph,33,38 this
procedure can be slow, especially if a signiﬁcant fraction of
the loops are large. A fast update scheme exists whereby the
change in the number of loops can be effectively sampled by
considering the combined bond-spin space, as ﬁrst discussed
by Sandvik and Evertz.39 We discuss our own implementation
of this protocol in the Appendix.

Let us deﬁne “normal” and “strange” versions of the bi-
linear spin correlation function, where we use an overbar to
denote mixed estimators such as the strange correlator:
(cid:104)R|S0 · Sr|ψ(cid:105)

(cid:104)ψ|S0 · Sr|ψ(cid:105)

C(r) =

(cid:104)ψ|ψ(cid:105)

,

¯C(r) =

(cid:104)R|ψ(cid:105)

.

(8)

Here, |ψ(cid:105) is the AKLT state and |R(cid:105) is a reference state used in
deﬁning the strange correlator. The reference state |R(cid:105) should
be a local product state with all the symmetries of |ψ(cid:105). One
choice for |R(cid:105) is thus a dimer product state with S valence

bonds making up each dimer. Such a state falls within the
singlet sector and mixed estimator ¯C(r) can be sampled in
the usual valence bond basis. However, while this choice
clearly has all the spin symmetries, it breaks translational
symmetry. Instead, we follow You et al.23 to choose an on-
site product state with zero spin projection along one axis,
i = 0(cid:105) (we the y-axis in place of the z axis for rea-

sons to be explained in the appendix). This state can be rep-
resented in the valence bond basis by pairing up the 2S spin
ﬂavors on a site into S spin-zero triplets (see Fig. 2 for an illus-
tration of |Ω(cid:105) and (cid:104)Ω|ψ(cid:105) for the S = 1 chain). We have given
an explicit formula for the spin correlations of two valence
bond conﬁgurations in Eq. (5). This formula is valid for any
bipartite valence bond conﬁgurations in the total singlet sec-
tor. To compute the strange correlator using |Ω(cid:105), however, we
must make use of onsite “internal triplet” states that require
new rules. As before, we can decompose the spin correlations
Si ·S j into the ﬂavor correlations si,α ·s j,β . However, we must
now evaluate these correlations in a mixed estimator between
a valence bond conﬁguration in the singlet sector |v(cid:105) and one
in the triplet sector |t(cid:105). This leads to the following formula,

(cid:104)v|si,α · s j,β|t(cid:105)

where λi,α↔ j,β is the “loop spacing” between i,α and j,β ,
deﬁned as +1 or −1 for even and odd distances between ﬂa-
vors in the same loop (and zero otherwise). Note that the usual
valence bond formula is recovered by setting λi,α↔ j,β = εi, j.
The modiﬁed rules that lead to this formula are derived in the
Appendix and illustrated in Fig. 3(c) and 3(d).

Note that a similar mixed correlator has been developed to
determine unambiguously the valence bond occupation num-
ber in bipartite valence bond states.40,41 In that application,
however, the Néel state is used as the reference state. In this
work, the Néel state is inappropriate, since it breaks all the
protecting symmetries of the the AKLT states—viz., time-
reversal invariance and the SO(3) and dihedral Z2 × Z2 sym-
metries.

In addition to the spin correlation functions described
above, we can also deﬁne a winding fraction, analogous to
the spin stiffness or superﬂuid fraction. Here, instead of us-
ing the winding number of a conserved charge, we utilize the
valence bond winding number, deﬁned as

If ρ remains constant as N → ∞, this is a sign of long-range

framework, it can be shown37 that M2 is related to the aver-
age squared length of loops in the loop gas picture. The exact

III. RESULTS

A. Linear chains

Historically, the AKLT chain was the ﬁrst robust example
of an integer spin-S antiferromagnet with short-range corre-
lations and a gap to all excited states,27 in conﬁrmation with
Haldane’s conjecture.42,43

The bilinear spin correlations in spin-S AKLT chains have

been calculated exactly by Arovas et al.30:

C(r) = (−1)r(S + 1)2

.

(cid:19)r

S + 2

We ﬁnd this equation to also be valid (by inspection) for the
strange correlator when S is even, while for S odd the strange
correlator yields:

¯C(r) = (−1)r (S + 1)2

These scaling forms are compared in Fig. 4 to results from
our MC sampling scheme for spin-S AKLT chains with spin
ranging from S = 1 to S = 9. For S = 1, we replicate the result
of You et al.,23 ¯C(∞) = 2, while for generic odd integral S
we ﬁnd ¯C(∞) = (S + 1)2/2. For S an even integer, we ﬁnd
¯C(∞) = 0. Thus, the strange correlator correctly captures the
even-odd effect in this system: for S even, the edge spins are
integral and the bulk state is smoothly connected to a product
state, while for S odd, the edge spins are fractional and the
bulk cannot be smoothly connected to a product state as long
as the symmetry is preserved.

We can also measure higher order moments of the two-spin

correlation function,

Cn(r) = (cid:104)(cid:0)S0 · Sr

(cid:1)n(cid:105).

(15)

We introduce the notation Cn and ¯Cn to represent the normal
and strange forms of the nth order moment of the correla-
tion function obtained using pure and mixed expectation val-
ues, respectively. Using a transfer matrix method, Freitag and
Müller-Hartmann44 were able to construct polynomials In(r)

make use of the relation 4π(S + 1)2(S + 3)2I2(r) = 30C2(r) +
15C1(r) − 10S2(S + 1)2 taken from the recursion relations
given in Ref. 44.

In Fig. 6 we show biquadratic (n = 2) spin correlations. For
the normal estimator, we observe exponential decay to a con-
stant value of S2(S +1)2/3, while for the strange estimator we
observe exponential decay to a constant value of S2(S +1)2/2,
but also see anomalous oscillations about this value (with no
sign of decay in the envelope) for odd values S.

We can also consider four-spin correlations of the form

F(r) = (cid:104)(cid:0)S0 · S1

(cid:1)(cid:0)Sr · Sr+1

(cid:1)(cid:105),

(17)
where as before we will use F(r) and ¯F(r) to refer to “normal”
and “strange” correlations, respectively. However, we ﬁnd
both F(r) and ¯F(r) to quickly decay to the value (cid:104)(S0 · S1)(cid:105)2
for all S, reﬂecting the fact that AKLT states are by deﬁnition
ﬁxed point valence bond solids with M singlets per bond.

1. Winding numbers

Bonesteel has shown that short-ranged valence bond con-
ﬁgurations can be classiﬁed by a topological invariant that
counts the number of valence bonds cut by a vertical bond.45

FIG. 6. Normal (left) and strange (right) biquadratic spin correlations
for spin-S AKLT chains. For odd S, the strange biquadratic correla-
tions exhibit oscillations with no decay in the oscillatory envelope.

For odd-width strips, vertical lines must cut through an even
or odd number of valence bonds, and shifting the vertical line
horizontally by one lattice spacing changes this number by
±1. Thus, short-ranged valence bond states can be divided
into two topologically distinct classes: one with an even-odd
pattern and another with an odd-even pattern. Similarly, on
even width strips the states break down into the sectors of all
even or all odd cuts.

The spin-S AKLT chains considered in this paper can be
thought of as short-ranged valence bond states in a strip ge-
ometry, with each position along the x-axis representing a sin-
gle spin-S site, and the constituent spin-1/2 ﬂavors distributed

along the y-axis. Since 2S is even for integral S, this corre-
sponds to the even-width geometry discussed above, and va-
lence bond states can be split into even and odd sectors. As
illustrated in Fig. 7, the spin-S AKLT states on a chain with
odd S all fall into the odd sector, while even S AKLT states
and internal triplet states belong to the even sector.

It can be shown that the valence bond overlap graphs
between states in different topological sectors must have a
nonzero winding number.45 Additionally, since the winding
number may only change by ±2, a topological winding num-
ber can be deﬁned as the winding modulo 2. At large S, we
have observed a small contribution to the strange winding for
even S, which we interpret as a ﬁnite-size effect that should
disappear in the thermodynamic limit. More to the point, we
ﬁnd that the topological winding is exactly zero for even S
AKLT states and exactly unity for odd S AKLT states. Thus,
the strange winding number modulo 2 is a topological invari-
ant for AKLT states in 1D.

As pointed out by Kim et al., the winding number charac-
terization of short-ranged valence bond conﬁgurations is inti-
mately related to string order in one dimension.46 The pres-
ence of string order implies a nonzero winding number, and
vice versa. In fact, for any short-ranged valence bond con-
ﬁguration in one dimension, a string order parameter can be
constructed in such a way as to be nonzero. Similarly, nonzero
winding can be achieved with the choice of an appropriate ref-
erence state: for states in the odd sector an even reference state
will yield nonzero winding, while for states in the even sector
an odd reference state yields nonzero winding. Nonzero wind-
ing is also what gives rise to long-range strange correlations,
since the estimator (cid:104)Ω|Si·S j|ψ(cid:105) can only have nonzero values
when i and j belong to the same loop in the transition graph
overlap. Thus, we see that the topological winding numbers
fully characterize the topological sectors of the AKLT states
in one dimension, and also give rise to the strange correlator
and the string order parameter.

B. Honeycombs and Squares

There is an exact mapping of multiplicity M AKLT states
onto classical O(3) models at temperature 1/M in the same
number of dimensions.
In 2D, this mapping implies (via
the Mermin-Wagner theorem) that AKLT states remain disor-
dered for ﬁnite M. However, the correlation length is expected
to grow exponentially with M. Additionally, an Orstein-
Zernicke form is expected for the spin-spin correlation func-
tion, i.e. C(r) ∼ e−r/ξ /rη. As we shall see, this makes

7

it difﬁcult to distinguish between algebraic and exponential
asymptotic forms of the correlation function when L < ξ . As
an alternative, we consider the winding fractions deﬁned in
Eq. (12), which decay to zero as L → ∞ whenever C(r) de-
cays exponentially, but obtain a constant value for algebraic
decay of C(r).

In 2D, the boundary modes of SPT states are 1+1 dimen-
sional gapless critical theories. Thus, they can be expected to
be conformally invariant, and by extension the strange corre-
lator should also be conformally invariant. Using this as our
justiﬁcation, we analyze the strange correlator using an alge-
braic function of the conformal length (cid:96); namely, ¯C((cid:96)) ∼ (cid:96)−η,
where (cid:96) = (L/π)sin(πr/L).

1. Honeycombs

The S = 3/2 AKLT state on the honeycomb lattice is the
ﬁrst extension of AKLT states to dimension higher than one.
Early on, Afﬂeck et al.28 and Kennedy et al.47 were able to es-
tablish upper bounds on the correlation length (ξ ≤ 3.54 and
ξ ≤ 2.5, respectively), which strongly implied a gapped dis-
ordered state. Later, Lou et al. calculated the entanglement
spectrum, concluding that the boundary modes are related to
a spin-1/2 Heisenberg ferromagnet with gapless quadratic dis-
persion.48 More recently, Huang et al. have studied the S =
3/2 AKLT state on the honeycomb lattice using the symme-
try protected quantum renormalization group.49 The S = 3/2
AKLT state is a so-called weak SPT state that cannot be pro-
tected by onsite symmetry alone. Rather, it is protected by
translational symmetry.

In Fig. 8 we show the normal and strange correlator for
spin-S AKLT states on the honeycomb lattice. The nor-
mal correlator decays exponentially with a very small cor-
relation length, even for S = 3 (the correlation length is ex-
pected to grow as ξ ∼ eπM in 2D spin-S AKLT states,30 with
M = 2S/z the multiplicity and z = 3 the lattice coordination).
The strange correlator is calculated using the internal triplet
product state, which can only be deﬁned for S an integer (in
general, no onsite symmetric product state can be formed for
fractional S). For S = 3, we see that the strange correlator
also displays exponential decay with a correlation length sim-
ilar to that of the normal correlator. Because the S = 3 AKLT
state can be thought of as two coupled copies of the S = 3/2
AKLT state, we expect it to be a trivial state (similar to the
even-odd effect in spin-S AKLT chains). We are not able
to see the expected exponential decay for the S = 6 strange
correlator, which we believe is due to ﬁnite size effects (in
other words, the correlation length is larger than the maxi-
mum system size studied, L = 1024). This is complicated by
the Ornstein-Zernike form of the correlations, exp(−r/ξ )/rη,
which for r (cid:28) ξ is indistinguishable from power-law decay.
Although we cannot form an onsite symmetric product state
for half-odd-integer S, there are many possible dimer prod-
uct states that retain the full spin rotational symmetry. How-
ever, a complication arises if we wish to use a dimer product
state as the reference state for calculating the strange corre-
lator. This is because dimer product states on a bipartite lat-

deﬁned for integer values of S. Lines are ﬁts to a functional form
C(r) = f (r) + f (L − r), with f (r) ∼ exp(−r/ξ )/rη . Correlations
are shown along the zigzag direction and are nearly isotropic. All
distances are given in units of the honeycomb primitive cell.

tice can be classiﬁed by dimer winding numbers that lead to
nonzero winding (and thus long range correlations) between
states in different dimer winding sectors.50,51 Thus, in order to
obtain an unambiguous signal from the strange correlator, we
must choose a dimer product state that is in the same dimer
winding sector as the AKLT state we which to probe. Fol-
lowing Ref. 51, we deﬁne dimer winding numbers along the
three zigzag axis of the honeycomb lattice wx, wy, and wz as
the number of valence bonds that are crossed in these three
directions. It turns out the the only dimer pattern that ﬁts this
description is the kekule pattern, but as shown in Fig. 9, the
strange correlator is short-ranged using such a reference state.
This is due to the fact that the kekule dimerization breaks
translational symmetry, which is a protecting symmetry of the
AKLT states in two dimensions (i.e. they are “weak” SPTs).

As in 1D, winding number fractions are an alternative way
to search for (quasi-)long-range correlations in 2D. In Fig. 10,
we show the winding numbers for even multiplicity AKLT
states on the honeycomb lattice. As expected, ρ approaches
zero with increasing system size. For small S, ¯ρ either ap-
proaches zero (S = 3), or shows signs of decreasing at larger
system sizes (S = 6). This allows us to conﬁrm that even mul-
tiplicity states are trivial for S = 3 and S = 6. For S = 9, we
also expect ¯ρ to ultimately decay to zero, but at system sizes
beyond our present computational capabilities (our largest
system has a total of N × 2S = 2× 20482 × 18 = 150994944
ﬂavor-site combinations.

Squares

We now move on to the AKLT state on a square lattice,
which has been considered by several past studies. Early on,
Kennedy et al. were able to provide a rigorous upper bound
to the correlation length ξ < 160.47 Later, Lou et al. calcu-
lated the entanglement spectrum, concluding that the bound-
ary modes are related to a spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromag-
net with gapless linear dispersion and central charge c = 1.48

ing a combination of transfer matrix and DMRG, ﬁnding an
algebraic decay with exponent η (cid:39) 0.32.23 The spin-2 AKLT
state on the square lattice has also been proposed as a universal
resource for measurement-based quantum computation.52 Fi-
nally, a recent proposal for classifying SPT phases with mirror
reﬂection and onsite Z2 symmetry includes the AKLT states
within its classiﬁcation scheme.53

In Fig. 11 we show the normal and strange correlations for
spin-S AKLT states on the square lattice. By ﬁtting the cor-
relations to an exponential form that takes into account the
periodicity of the lattice, C(r) = f (r) + f (L− r), with f (r) ∼
exp(−r/ξ )/rη, we see that normal correlations decay expo-
nentially, but with a correlation length ξ that quickly grows
with the spin quantum number (we note that ξ ∼ exp(πM)
is expected from theoretical considerations,30 with M = 2S/z
the multiplicity of the AKLT state with lattice coordination z).
For the strange correlator with even M, an exponential ﬁt also
works, but the correlation lengths (with the exception of the
S = 4 data) exceed the size of our simulation cell (L = 512).
Thus, we cannot distinguish between exponential and alge-
braic decay without resorting to larger system sizes. For odd
M, we ﬁt the strange correlator using an algebraic function of
the conformal length, ¯C((cid:96)) ∼ (cid:96)−η. Importantly, this functional
form does not work well for the S = 4 (even M) state. This is
related to the fact that the strange correlator decreases more
rapidly for the S = 4 AKLT state than for the S = 2 AKLT
state, which is an indication that the S = 4 AKLT state has a
ﬁnite correlation length.

To investigate the difference between the S = 2 and S = 4
AKLT states on the square lattice in greater detail, we look at

the strange correlator for system sizes L = 1024 (with N = L2
sites close to one million, close to the maximum system size
we can simulate). As shown in Fig. 12, ﬁtting to the S = 2 data
yields a decay exponent that is identical to the L = 512 result.
However, the S = 4 data is now has best ﬁt by a correlation
length ξ ∼ 468 < L, indicating a short-ranged strange correla-
tor and trivial SPT character. This in turn implies an even-odd
effect for AKLT states with multiplicity M = 2S/z (for S = 2
the multiplicity is one while S = 4 has multiplicity two), in
agreement with recent classiﬁcation scheme for bosonic SPT
states in 2D protected by reﬂection symmetry.53

In principle, the power-law exponent of the strange correla-
tor should match that of the boundary theory. For the case
of the square lattice AKLT state with odd multiplicity, the
edge theory should be given by a conformal ﬁeld theory with
central charge c = 1 and Luttinger parameter K = 1. In our
present work, we have found η ≈ 0.33, which does not match
the expected 1/r decay predicted from the Luttinger theory
of a half-odd-integral Heisenberg spin chain. Note, however,
that the internal triplet state reduces the O(3) spin symmetry
down to O(2)× Z2. Thus, we should not expect a direct rela-
tion to the Luttinger theory of the isotropic Heisenberg chain
unless we instead choose an O(3) symmetric product state.

As before, we can also deﬁne winding numbers for the
AKLT on the square lattice. In contrast to the AKLT chain,
the topological component of the winding numbers for mixed
overlaps is now strictly zero–that is, the square lattice AKLT
state and the internal triplet state are in the same topologi-
cal sector as deﬁned by the topological winding. However,
the non-topological component of the winding numbers is
nonzero for the mixed overlap state.
In particular, we ﬁnd

the ground state develops long-range magnetic order. For even
multiplicity, we can also measure winding in the mixed over-
lap between the AKLT state and the internal triplet product
state. For M = 2 we ﬁnd zero winding, indicating a trivial
quantum paramagnet and conﬁrming the even-odd effect in
3D AKLT states, while for M ≥ 4 we ﬁnd a nonzero winding
fraction, which in this case reﬂects the broken symmetry of
the magnetically ordered ground state.

IV. ENERGY GAPS

In 1D, AKLT states have been rigorously proven to pos-
sess a ﬁnite gap to excitations.28 In 2D, AKLT states are also
believed to be gapped; however, this has not be shown rig-
orously, although for the honeycomb and square lattices the
AKLT states have been shown to decay exponentially.47

Much progress has been made on the numerical front. Early
on, Arovas et al. used the single-mode approximation to ob-
tain an upper bound of the excitation gap ∆ ≤ 10
27 (cid:39) 0.370 for
the S = 1 AKLT chain.30 More recently, Garcia-Saez et al.
used tensor network methods to obtain an estimate ∆ ≈ 0.350

a ﬁnite strange winding fraction ¯ρ (cid:39) 0.95, whereas the nor-
mal winding fraction ρ = 0 in keeping with the lack of Néel
order and hence zero spin stiffness in the square lattice AKLT
state. These results are summarized in Fig. 13, where we also
show data for larger values of S. The even-odd effect is clearly
seen in the downward turn of the strange winding fraction for
S = 4, whereas for S = 8 we are not able to reach large enough
system sizes to see this trend.

C. Cubes, Diamonds, and Hyperhoneycombs

To investigate AKLT states on 3D lattices, we use the wind-
ing fractions as deﬁned in Eq. (12). Results for the cubic and
diamond lattices are shown in Fig. 14. On the cubic lattice,
ρ indicates that magnetic order is present beginning with the
multiplicity one AKLT state at S = 3. In contrast, ρ is zero
for the multiplicity one S = 2 AKLT state on the diamond
lattice, with magnetic order setting in for S ≥ 4 (or, M ≥ 2).
These results are in agreement with Monte Carlo investiga-
tions of the equivalent classical model at inverse temperature
M, which found magnetic order on the cubic and diamond lat-
tices for M (cid:38) 0.60 and M (cid:38) 1.18, respectively.32 Our present
study goes one step further to show that, in addition to being
magnetically disordered, the M = 1 AKLT state on the dia-
mond lattice is also a nontrivial SPT state.

We also consider

the hyperhoneycomb lattice, a tri-
coordinated lattice with elementary loops of ten lattice sites
and four sites per primitive cell. We are not aware of any study
of AKLT states on this lattice, but due to its lower connectiv-
ity (as compared with the cubic and diamond lattices) we can
expect that at least the M = 1 state is disordered. As shown in
Fig. 15, we actually ﬁnd zero winding in the normal overlap
for both the M = 1 and M = 2 states, which indicates a non-
magnetic (quantum paramagnetic) ground state. For M ≥ 3,
the winding fraction is stable with respect to system size as

is probably due to limitations in our sampling scheme. To
overcome these limitations, it would be interesting to develop
a generalization of the loop algorithm in Ref. 39 to the case of
spin-S representations of valence bond states. However, such
a study is outside the scope of the present manuscript and we
leave it for future consideration.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have developed a numerical framework for computing
the strange correlator in the valence bond basis, which allows
us to characterize the symmetry protected topological proper-
ties of AKLT states in one, two and three dimensions. In 1D,
our method gives a clear picture of the origin of long-range
correlations in the strange correlator (viz., the persistence of
a single system-spanning valence-bond loop). It also allows
us to make connections between the strange correlator and
the topological winding number sectors.45 In 2D and 3D, the
topological winding number characterization disappears, but
we were able to show that a winding number fraction (in anal-
ogy to the superﬂuid fraction or spin stiffness) survives and
can be used as an alternative way to characterize SPT states.
In 1D, comparison to exact results conﬁrms the accuracy
of our numerical method. Notably, our results reproduce the
well-known even-odd effect in 1D AKLT chains: states with
even integer spin (S even) are trivial states, whereas odd in-
teger spin states (S odd) are nontrivial SPT states. In 2D, we
demonstrate that the same even-odd effect exists on the hon-
eycomb and square lattices, where even and odd now refer to
the multiplicity M of the AKLT state (M even is trivial, M
odd is nontrivial). To the best of our knowledge, our study
is the ﬁrst to provide numerical evidence of the even-odd ef-
fect in two-dimensional AKLT states. In 3D, we observe the
signatures of magnetic order for large spin, conﬁrming past
Monte Carlo studies of the equivalent classical O(3) model.32
We were also able to show direct evidence of nontrivial SPT
character for the S = 2 diamond AKLT state, and that that the
S = 3/2 and S = 3 hyperhoneycomb AKLT states do not mag-
netically order.

We have also applied the valence bond formalism to cal-
culate energy gap estimates. By sequentially operating the
full Hamiltonian on a trial state in the single triplet sector, we
were able to estimate the triplet gap, which compares well
with results from other methods. In principle a sign-sampled
quantum Monte Carlo method should be able to asymptoti-
cally approach the exact energy gap; however, we were unable
to obtain sufﬁciently converged results using a naive sampling
method for the Hamiltonian projection ˆHm|ψt(cid:105).

The methods employed in this paper can also be applied to a
wide variety of SPT states away from the exact AKLT points.
This includes weakly coupled Haldane chains,58 which have
drawn renewed interest in light of the new SPT classiﬁcation
scheme, as well as “disordered” versions of the AKLT states
where defects such as domain walls are allowed to proliferate,
which may be a way to study the topological phase transition
from weak to strong SPT phases.59

Ganesh et al. have also estimated the excitation gap for the
S = 3/2 AKLT honeycomb using exact diagonalization, ﬁnd-
ing a value ≈ 0.1 consistent with the literature,55 while Poil-
blanc et al. have found a critical ﬁeld (cid:39) 0.113 for the S = 3/2
AKLT honeycomb, in agreement with the expectation that the
ﬁeld must close the gap.56 More recently, Vanderstraeten et al.
have used variational ansatz based on the PEPS formalism to
ﬁnd an upper bound ∆SMA = 0.0199 and variational estimate
∆var = 0.0147 for the excitation gap of the S = 2 AKLT state
on the square lattice, as well as a rather precise value for the
correlation length ξ = 2.06491.57

i − Sz

Excitation gaps can also be estimated using the valence
bond formalism discussed in this paper.
In this formalism,
the most natural excitation is to convert a singlet bond into a
triplet. In particular, a superposition of AKLT states with the
triplet in all possible locations, |ψt(cid:105) = ∑(cid:104)i, j(cid:105)(Sz
j)|ψ(cid:105) is a
very good approximation of the lowest energy gap (at π for a
chain, (π,π) for a square, etc.).
In Table II we show energy gap estimates obtained from
∆est = (cid:104)R| ˆH|ψt(cid:105)/(cid:104)R|ψt(cid:105), where in this case the reference state
|R(cid:105) is chosen to be the Néel state that has equal overlap with
all valence bond conﬁgurations. Note that since ∆est is ob-
tained from a projection instead of an expectation value, it is
not a variational estimate.
We also attempted to access the excitation gap asymptoti-
cally using the projected state ˆHm|ψt(cid:105). However, due to the
presence of a quantum Monte Carlo sign problem we were
unable to obtain sufﬁciently converged results to present here.
Since the sign problem for AKLT Hamiltonians is not ex-
pected to be severe (there are no explicitly frustrated inter-
actions), the failure of our projected triplet states to converge

Appendix A: Rules for loop updates

During the Monte Carlo sampling of valence bond over-
laps, it is necessary to evaluate the relative weights of vari-
ous loop structures. Fortunately, these are easily calculated in
the valence bond basis and are determined solely by N(cid:96), the
number of loops formed by a particular valence bond overlap.
Thus, calculation of the relative weight of valence bond over-
laps amounts to counting the relative difference in N(cid:96) before
and after a proposed update, i.e. ∆N(cid:96) = Nnew

(cid:96) − Nold

We introduce a singlet projection operator ˆPµ,ν = 1

In this appendix, we construct a set of rules for counting
∆N(cid:96) for a generic bipartite loop under two types of updates:
onsite symmetrization of the ﬂavor components and operation
of the singlet projector operator.

will allow us to keep track of rearrangements of our bipartite
valence bond states through the following useful formulae:

and jν ∈ B).

When calculating the strange correlator, we use an on-site
product state consisting of the symmetric superposition of

triplets, with |{µ,ν}(cid:105) ≡(cid:0)|↑(cid:105)µ ⊗|↑(cid:105)ν +|↓(cid:105)µ ⊗|↓(cid:105)ν

2. On
bipartite lattices, the resulting loops in the transition graph
must contain an even number of triplet links, which allows
us to perform the usual operations without having to worry
about potential singlet-triplet annihilation (in general, two va-
lence bond states are orthogonal if any of the loops in their
overlap graph contain an odd number of triplets). It is useful
to list the modiﬁed formulae for ˆP and ˆQ in this sector:

ˆPµ,ν|{µ,ν}(cid:105) = 0
ˆPν,σ|{µ,ν}{σ ,τ}(cid:105) = −1

Let us note that the minus sign in the above equation does not
lead to an overall sign problem in the Monte Carlo simulation
scheme employed in this paper. This is due to the fact that
the overlap between a singlet valence bond conﬁguration |v(cid:105)
and a triplet conﬁguration |t(cid:105) is always in the same sign sector,
which is given by (−1)SN/2. On a bipartite lattice, N is always
even, while the triplet state |t(cid:105) is only deﬁned for integer S.

1. Singlet projection operator updates

In a singlet projector update, we wish to act upon a pair
of ﬂavor components with a singlet projector. In this case the
pair of ﬂavors µ, ν belong to different sites. If µ and ν belong
to the same sublattice, we instead use the parity operator ˆQ.
When this occurs, one of three possible rearrangements will
occur (see Fig. 16).
First, if µ and ν belong to separate loops, these loops will
merge, and ∆N(cid:96) = −1. Next, if µ and ν belong to the same
loop, this loop will either remain intact or split in two, depend-
ing on the “loop distance” (call this ∆(cid:96)) between µ and ν. If
∆(cid:96) is even, the loop remains intact and ∆N(cid:96) = 0. If ∆(cid:96) is odd,
the loop splits in two as long as µ and ν do not belong to the
same singlet, and ∆N(cid:96) = 1. In the case where µ and ν already

13

ν belong to the same loop with an even number of valence bonds
connecting them. After the update, they remain in the same loop with
no change in the loop ordering structure. (b) µ and ν belong to the
same loop with an odd number of valence bonds connecting them.
After the update, the loop is split so that µ and ν no longer belong to
the same loop. (c) µ and ν belong to separate loops that merge into
a single loop, after which µ and ν have an odd loop spacing.

form a singlet with one another, the loop obviously remains
intact, even though ∆(cid:96) = 1 by deﬁnition.

Combining the prefactors of the singlet projection opera-
tor (1/2 or 1 depending on whether or not µ and ν belong to
different singlets) with the above determined loop weights, we
obtain the total weights for singlet projection operator updates
as follows:

• If µ and ν belong to different loops, then combine loops

with probability 1/4

• If µ and ν belong to same loop with even loop spacing,

then keep reordered loop with probability 1/2

• If µ and ν belong to same loop with odd loop spacing
and are not connected as a singlet, then split loops with
probability 1

• If µ and ν belong to same loop and are connected as a

singlet, then keep current loop with probability 1

FIG. 17. Possible rearrangements for parity updates. (a) µ and ν
belong to the same loop with an odd number of valence bonds con-
necting them. After the update, they remain in the same loop while
the two untouched segments (red dashed lines) retain their internal
structure, but pick up an odd factor in their relative ordering. (b) µ
and ν belong to the same loop with an even number of valence bonds
connecting them. After the update, the loop is split so that µ and ν
no longer belong to the same loop. In the reverse update, µ and ν
belong to separate loops that merge into a single loop, after which µ
and ν have an even loop spacing.

As before, if µ and ν belong to separate loops, these loops
will merge, and ∆N(cid:96) = −1. Next, if µ and ν belong to the
same loop, this loop will either remain intact or split in two,
depending on the “loop distance” (call this ∆(cid:96)) between µ and
ν. If ∆(cid:96) is even, the loop splits in two, and ∆N(cid:96) = 1. If ∆(cid:96) is
odd, the loop remains intact and ∆N(cid:96) = 0. Note that the loop
update rules are the opposite of the singlet projection operator
for the case where µ and ν belong to the same loop.

Combining the prefactors of the singlet projection opera-
tor (1/2 or 1 depending on whether or not µ and ν belong to
different singlets) with the above determined loop weights, we
obtain the total weights for singlet projection operator updates
as follows:

• If µ and ν belong to different loops, then combine loops

with probability 1/4

• If µ and ν belong to same loop with even loop spacing,

then split loops with probability 1

• If µ and ν belong to same loop with odd loop spacing,

then keep reordered loop with probability 1/2

3. Symmetrization updates

2. Parity operator updates

When the ﬂavors µ and ν belong to the same sublattice, we
instead use the parity operator ˆQ. In this case, one of three
possible rearrangements will occur (see Fig. 17).

In a symmetrization update, we wish to symmetrize over
all possible relabelings of the onsite ﬂavor components. This
entails randomly picking a pair of ﬂavors on a given site (call
them µ and ν), then exchanging their labels. This update is
related to the parity operator update, but in this case the factor
2 that comes from acting on a state with ˆQ will drop out in
of 1

(a) (b) μνμνμμνν(c) μμνν(a) (b) μνμμμνννthe detailed balance equation; only the weight associated with
loop rearrangements survives. (Equivalently, we can consider
symmetrization updates as acting upon the current state with
an operator 2 ˆQ.) As discussed above, one of three possible
rearrangements will occur. This time, their total probabilities
are

• If µ and ν belong to different loops, then combine loops

with probability 1/2

• If µ and ν belong to same loop with even loop spacing,
then split loops with probability 1 (relative weight is 2)
• If µ and ν belong to same loop with odd loop spacing,

then keep reordered loop with probability 1

Thus, to construct the symmetrization updates appears to
be quite simple. Just choose some µ and ν, then use 2 ˆQµν to
reorder the valence bond pattern with probability p given by
the above list. Since p depends on whether or not µ and ν
belong to the same loop, at ﬁrst glance it appears that we have
to keep a record of all loops. Actually, this is not the case,
and we can in fact form a “fast” update that does not need
to keep track of loop memberships during the course of the
update. The trick is to take advantage of the bipartite nature of
valence bonds and construct a pseudospin degree of freedom
that is attached to each sublattice (say, “up” on A and “down”
on B), but within a given loop these pseudospins are ﬂipped
with probability 1/2. Then we accept an update if and only
if the pseudospin of µ matches the pseudospin of ν.
If µ
and ν belong to the same loop, then since they belong to the
same sublattice their pseudospins must match and we always
accept this update (in agreement with the probability list given
above). However, if µ and ν belong to different loops, then
their relative pseudospins are randomized and will only match
1/2 the time, and we end up accepting this type of move with
probability 1/2 (again in agreement with the probability list
given above).

4. Updates in combined bond-spin space

The fast updates described above can alternatively be for-
mulated in the combined space of the valence bond basis and
Sz component spin basis. As discussed by Sandvik and Ev-
ertz,39 this basis can be formed by considering the possible
Sz conﬁgurations on top of the valence bond conﬁgurations.
Since all overlap graphs in the valence bond basis considered
in this work form systems of closed loops, the only allowed Sz
conﬁgurations consist of alternating up and down spins within
a loop. In general, the pattern of up and down spins between
separate loops do not need to agree, and it is easy to see that
this combined picture provides a physical motivation for the
pseudospin degree of freedom introduced in the fast updates
described above. Sandvik and Evertz only considered pure va-
lence bond overlap graphs (i.e. they did not consider the type
of internal triplet states we consider in this work for the calcu-
lation of the strange correlator), so here we show that overlaps
between the internal triplet state and an arbitrary valence bond
state produce the pseudospin pattern described above.

14

To derive the appropriate pseudospin pattern used in the fast
updates, it is convenient to write the internal triplet state as a
product state in the Sy basis:

|Ω(cid:105) = ∏
For spin S = 1, the onsite state |Sy
i = 0(cid:105) can be written in terms
of the spin-1/2 degrees of freedom projected along the z axis
as

(A3)

i

(cid:12)(cid:12)Sy
i = 0(cid:11)

2(cid:12)(cid:12)Sy
i = 0(cid:11) = |↑↑(cid:105) +|↓↓(cid:105)

√

(A4)

so that the AABB pattern within each closed loop will contain
a pseudospin pattern of either ↑↑↓↓ or ↓↓↑↑. For higher spin,
we simply form the symmetric combination of S pairs in the
Sy
i = 0 state listed above. Thus, our internal triplet state can
only be formed for integral S. In general, the loops formed
in the overlap graph state between these internal triplet states
and an arbitrary valence bond conﬁguration will always obey
an AABB pattern, and the form of the internal triplet state de-
scribed above allows for two possible spin arrangements in
the Sz basis: ↑↑↓↓ and ↓↓↑↑. Hence, the pseudospin update
can also be applied to calculations of the strange correlator
and represents a generalization of the fast updates in the com-
bined bond-spin space described by Sandvik and Evertz.39

Appendix B: Rules for measuring spin correlation functions

The above rules for loop updates may also be used to con-
struct rules for measuring spin correlation functions. They
can be summarized by the following formula for spin ﬂavors
µ and ν:

(cid:19)

,

sµ · sν = δµ↔ν

εiµ , jν +

λµ↔ν

(B1)

where δµ↔ν is a delta function that triggers when µ and ν are
in the same loop, while iµ and jν are the sites hosting the spin
ﬂavors µ and ν, respectively. As in the main text, εiµ , jν = ±1
for iµ and jν on the same (+1) or opposite (−1) sublattices,
and λµ↔ν = ±1 for µ and ν with even (+1) or odd (−1) loop
distance.

For valence bond overlaps in the singlet sector, the ABAB
pattern within each loop guarantees that when iµ and jν be-
long to the same (opposite) sublattice, their loop spacing is
even (odd). Thus, the above formula reduces to

sµ · sν =

δµ↔νεiµ , jν .

This is the standard formula for spin correlations in the va-
lence bond basis. Beach and Sandvik have extended this to
the case of four-spin correlations,37

after acting on the overlap graph with sσ · sτ. Since the oper-
ation of sσ · sτ may merge, rearrange, or split existing loops,
this is delta function is distinct from the unprimed one. For
mixed overlap states, a more general relation can be derived:

Again, the prime indicates the values in the updated conﬁg-
uration obtained by acting sσ · sτ on the overlap graph. This
simpliﬁes to the normal relation whenever εiµ , jν = λµ↔ν.

In the next two subsections, we derive each component of

the above expressions.

1. Using singlet projection operator updates

When the ﬂavors µ and ν belong to opposite sublattices, we
can decompose the spin correlations as sµ · sν = 1/4− ˆPµ,ν.

15

Since we already know the weights of ˆPµ,ν, we can easily de-
termine the weights of sµ · sν:

• If µ and ν belong to different loops, then sµ ·sν = 1/4−
(1/4) = 0

• If µ and ν belong to same loop with even loop spacing,
then sµ · sν = 1/4− (1/2) = −1/4
• If µ and ν belong to same loop with odd loop spacing,
then sµ · sν = 1/4− (1) = −3/4

2. Using parity operator updates

When the ﬂavors µ and ν belong to the same sublattice, we
instead decompose the spin correlations as sµ · sν = ˆQµ,ν −
1/4. Since we already know the weights of ˆQµ,ν, we can eas-
ily determine the weights of sµ · sν:

• If µ and ν belong to different loops, then sµ ·sν = 1/4−
1/4 = 0

• If µ and ν belong to same loop with even loop spacing,
then sµ · sν = 1− 1/4 = 3/4
• If µ and ν belong to same loop with odd loop spacing,
then sµ · sν = 1/2− 1/4 = 1/4
