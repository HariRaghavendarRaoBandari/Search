ON KEMNITZ’ CONJECTURE CONCERNING LATTICE POINTS IN

THE PLANE

CHRISTIAN REIHER

Abstract. In 1961, P. Erdős, A. Ginzburg, and A. Ziv proved a remarkable theorem
stating that each set of 2n ´ 1 integers contains a subset of size n, the sum of whose
elements is divisible by n. We will prove a similar result for pairs of integers, i.e., planar
lattice points, usually referred to as Kemnitz’ conjecture.

§1. Introduction

Denoting by fpn, kq the minimal number f, such that any set of f lattice points in
the k-dimensional Euclidean space contains a subset of cardinality n, the sum of whose
elements is divisible by n, it was ﬁrst proved by P. Erdős, A. Ginzburg, and A. Ziv [2],
that fpn, 1q “ 2n ´ 1.

The problem, however, to determine fpn, 2q turned out to be unexpectedly diﬃcult:
A. Kemnitz [3] conjectured it to equal 4n ´ 3 and knew, (1) that 4n ´ 3 is a rather
straighforward lower bound˚, (2) that the set of all integers n satisfying fpn, 2q “ 4n ´ 3 is
closed under multiplication and that it therefore suﬃces to prove this equation for prime
values of n, and (3) that his assertion was correct for n “ 2, 3, 5, 7 and, consequently, also
for every n that is expressible as a product of these numbers.

Linear upper bounds estimating fpp, 2q, where p denotes any prime number, appeared
for the ﬁrst time in an article by N. Alon and M. Dubiner [1] who proved fpp, 2q ď 6p ´ 5
for all p and fpp, 2q ď 5p ´ 2 for large p. Later this was improved to fpp, 2q ď 4p ´ 2 by
L. Rónyai [4].

In the third section of this article we prove Kemnitz’ conjecture.

§2. Preliminary Results

Notational conventions. In the sequel the letter p is always assumed to designate an
odd prime number and congruence modulo p is simply denoted by “””. Roman capital
letters (such as J, X, . . .) will always stand for ﬁnite sets of lattice points in the Euclidean
plane. The sum of the elements of such a set, taken coordinatewise, will be indicated by a

All propositions contained in this section are deduced without the use of combinatorial

arguments from the following result due to Chevalley and Warning (see e.g., [5]).
Theorem 2.1. Let P1, P2, . . . , Pm P Frx1, . . . , xns be some polynomials over a ﬁnite ﬁeld F
of characteristic p. Provided that the sum of their degrees is less than n, the number Ω of
their common zeros in F n is divisible by p.

considered as polynomials over the ﬁeld containing p elements. Their common zeros fall
into two classes depending on whether x3p´2 “ 0 or not. The ﬁrst class consists of

1 ` pp ´ 1qppp| Jq ` pp ´ 1q2pp2p| Jq

solutions, whereas the second class includes

pp ´ 1qppp ´ 1| Jq ` pp ´ 1q2pp2p ´ 1| Jq

solutions.

(cid:3)

The ﬁrst of the following two assertions is proved quite analogously and entails the

second one immediately.
Corollary 2.3. If |J| “ 3p ´ 2 or |J| “ 3p ´ 1, then 1 ´ pp| Jq ` p2p| Jq ” 0.
Corollary 2.4. If |J| “ 3p ´ 2 or |J| “ 3p ´ 1, then pp| Jq “ 0 implies p2p| Jq ” ´1.

Now we come to an important statement due to N. Alon and M. Dubiner [1].

Corollary 2.5. If J contains exactly 3p elements whose sum is ” p0, 0q, then pp| Jq ą 0.
Proof. Let A P J be arbitrary. Arguing indirectly we assume that pp| Jq “ 0. This
obviously implies pp| J ´ Aq “ 0 and owing to |J ´ A| “ 3p ´ 1 the above Corollary 2.4
yields p2p, J ´ Aq ” ´1. So in particular we have p2p| J ´ Aq ą 0 and the condition
(cid:3)

J ” p0, 0q entails indeed pp| Jq “ p2p| Jq ě p2p| J ´ Aq ą 0.
The next two statements are similar to Corollary 2.3 and may also be proved in the

ř

same manner.
Corollary 2.6. If |X| “ 4p ´ 3, then

(a ) ´1 ` pp| Xq ´ p2p| Xq ` p3p| Xq ” 0

Corollary 2.7. If |X| “ 4p´3, then 3´2pp´1| Xq´2pp| Xq`p2p´1| Xq`p2p| Xq ” 0.

The reduction of the binomial coeﬃcients modulo p leads directly to the claim.

§3. Resolution of Kemnitz’ Conjecture

Lemma 3.1. If |X| “ 4p ´ 3 and pp| Xq “ 0, then pp ´ 1| Xq ” p3p ´ 1| Xq.
Proof. Let χ denote the number of partitions X “ A Y B Y C satisfying

To determine χ, at least modulo p, we ﬁrst run through all admissible A and employing
Corollary 2.4 we count for each of them how many possibilities for B are contained in its
complement, thus getting

Therefore indeed, by counting the same entities twice, pp ´ 1| Xq ” p3p ´ 1| Xq.
(cid:3)
Theorem 3.2. Any choice of 4p ´ 3 lattice–points in the plane contains a subset of
cardinality p whose centroid is a lattice-point as well.

Proof. Adding up the congruences obtained in the Corollaries 2.6(a ), 2.6(b ), 2.7, and
the previous lemma one deduces 2 ´ pp| Xq ` p3p| Xq ” 0. Since p is odd, this implies
that pp| Xq and p3p| Xq cannot vanish simultaneously which in turn yields our assertion
pp| Xq ‰ 0 via Corollary 2.5
(cid:3)
As Kemnitz [3] remarked, for p “ 2 the above result is an easy consequence of the box-
principle. Since according to fact (1) mentioned in the introduction the general statement
fpn, 2q “ 4n ´ 3 (for every positive integer n) follows immediately from the special case
where n is a prime number, we have thereby proved Kemnitz’ conjecture.
