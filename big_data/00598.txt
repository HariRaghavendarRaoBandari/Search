Abstract: CP violation of the Standard Model (SM) is insuﬃcient to explain the
baryon asymmetry in the Universe and therefore an additional source of CP violation
is needed. Here we consider the extension of the SM by a neutral complex singlet and
discuss the physical conditions for a spontaneous CP violation in such model. In the
model there are three neutral Higgs particles. Assuming the lightest one to be the 125
GeV Higgs boson found at LHC we calculate masses of the additional Higgs scalars
and perform a numerical study of the allowed region of parameters. The scenario
according to which the SM-like Higgs particle comes mostly from the SM-like SU(2)
doublet, with a small modiﬁcation coming from the singlet, is in agreement with the
newest Rγγ and precise EW (parameters S, T) data. We have found that the Jarlskog
invariant, measuring the strength of the CP violation, can be enhanced as compared
to the one in the SM, at the same time there is no corresponding enhancements
expected for the Electric Dipole Moment (EDM).

Introduction

It is well known that in the Standard Model (SM), where CP is explicitly broken
at the Lagrangian level through the complex Yukawa couplings, the single phase in
the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix (CKM) is a unique source of CP violation.
According to Sakharov [1], there are three requirements that must be satisﬁed in
order to generate the baryon asymmetry of the Universe, namely the violation of
the baryon number, violation of C and CP symmetries and the existence of non
equilibrium processes, see also reference [2]. In spite of satisfying these demands,

– 1 –

the amount of CP violation within the SM is not suﬃcient to explain the observed
baryon asymmetry of the Universe [3–5]. In order to have an extra source of CP
violation, that could allow to address this important issue, various extensions of the
SM are considered [6–10].

Here we shall assume that the additional sources of CP violation are provided
by a neutral complex scalar singlet χ, which accompanies the SM-like Higgs doublet
Φ. This kind of extension of the SM was discussed in the literature with various
motivations, see eg.
[11–17]. We focus on the issue of a CP violation due to a
complex singlet with a complex expectation value. We consider the potential with a
softly broken global U(1) symmetry, which we call the Constrained SM+CS model
(cSMCS), see also [18, 19]. Assuming nonzero vacuum expectation value for the
complex singlet we analyse the physical conditions for spontaneously CP violation.
We found that the existence of at least one cubic term in the potential is necessary
in this respect. In the model there are three neutral Higgs particles with mixed CP
properties. Assuming the lightest one, predominately CP-even, to be 125 GeV Higgs
boson found at LHC, we calculate masses of the other Higgs scalars and perform
a numerical study of the allowed region of parameters. We calculate the Jarlskog
invariant [20–23], measuring the amount of the CP violation, and comment the pre-
diction of the model for the electric dipole moment EDM. The scenario realized in the
model according to which the SM-like Higgs particle comes mostly from the SM-like
SU(2) doublet, with a small modiﬁcation coming from the singlet, is in agreement
with the newest Rγγ and precise EW data. We propose the benchmarks to test this
model. Some preliminary results we presented in [19].

The model considered in this paper is a part of a larger framework presented
in [18], where the extension of the SM by a complex singlet and the inert doublet
(with vev =0) has been studied, with the focus on the properties of dark matter. We
partly follow this analysis in the construction of the potential of the cSMCS.

The content of this paper is as follows. Section 2 contains a general presentation
of the SMCS model and its constrained version (cSMCS) investigated in the paper.
In particular, the subsection 2.3 describes the conditions for the spontaneous CP
violation in the model. Physical states in the Higgs sector are discussed in section 3.
The numerical results of scans over parameters of the model are collected in sec. 4.
In the section 5 the Jarlskog invariants for the scalars are discussed. In the section
6 the agreement of cSMCS model with existing measurements of the properties of
the SM-like Higgs boson as well as comparison with data on S and T parameters
are shown. Here also we comment on predictions of the model on the EDM. The
benchmarks are presented here as well. Section 7 contains the conclusion. Detailed
formulas are presented in the Appendix.

2 The cSMCS: The SM plus a complex singlet

The full Lagrangian of the model is given by

L = LSM

gf + Lscalar + LY (ψf , Φ) , Lscalar = T − V,

(2.1)

where LSM
gf describes the pure gauge bosons terms as well the SM boson-fermion
interaction, Lscalar describes the scalar sector of the model with one SU(2) doublet Φ
and a neutral complex scalar (spinless) singlet χ. LY (ψf , Φ) represents the Yukawa
interaction of Φ with SM fermions. The neutral complex scalar singlet χ does not
couple to the SM fermions and therefore the singlet-fermion interaction is present
only through the mixing of the singlet χ with the doublet Φ, the same holds for
singlet interaction with the gauge bosons. The SM-like Higgs boson in the model
predominantly consists of a neutral CP-even component of the Φ doublet.

We assume Φ and χ ﬁelds have vacuum expectation values (vev) v and weiξ,
respectively, where v, w, ξ ∈ R. We shall use the following ﬁeld decomposition around
the vacuum state:

(cid:32)

(cid:33)

Φ =

1√
2

φ+

(v + φ1 + iφ4)

,

χ =

1√
2

(weiξ + φ2 + iφ3).

(2.2)

Masses of the gauge bosons and the fermions are given by the vev of the doublet, e.g
M 2

W = g2v2/4 for the W boson.

2.1 Potential

The scalar potential of the model can be written as follows

V = VD + VS + VDS,

(2.3)

with the pure doublet and the pure singlet parts (respectively VD and VS) and their
interaction term VDS. The SM part of the potential, VD, is given by:

VD = − 1

11Φ†Φ + 1

2λ1

2m2

(cid:0)Φ†Φ(cid:1)2 .

(2.4)

The potential for a complex singlet is equal to:
VS = − 1

sχ∗χ − 1

2m2

4(χ∗2 + χ2) + λs1(χ∗χ)2 + λs2(χ∗χ)(χ∗2 + χ2) + λs3(χ4 + χ∗4)
(2.5)

2m2
+κ1(χ + χ∗) + κ2(χ3 + χ∗3) + κ3(χ + χ∗)(χ∗χ).

The doublet-singlet interaction terms are:

VDS = Λ1(Φ†Φ)(χ∗χ) + Λ2(Φ†Φ)(χ∗2 + χ2) + κ4(Φ†Φ)(χ + χ∗).

(2.6)

There are three quadratic (m2
i ), six dimensionless quartic (λi, Λi) and four dimen-
sionful parameters κi, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, describing linear (κ1) and cubic terms. The

– 3 –

linear term κ1 can be removed by a translation of the singlet ﬁeld, and therefore can
be neglected. To simplify the model, we apply a global U(1) symmetry

U (1) : Φ → Φ, χ → eiαχ

(2.7)

to reduce the number of parameters in the potential [18].

However, a non-zero vev of χ would lead in such case to a spontaneous breaking
of this symmetry and an appearance of massless Nambu-Goldstone scalar particles,
what is not acceptable. Keeping some U(1) soft-breaking terms in the potential would
solve this problem and at the same time would still lead to a reduction of the number
of parameters of V. In what follows, we shall consider a potential with a soft-breaking
of U(1) symmetry, where the singlet cubic terms κ2,3 and the singlet quadratic term
m2
4 are kept, while κ4 term is neglected 1. Therefore, we are left with the U(1)-
symmetric terms (m2
4, κ2,3).
Simplifying slightly the notation by using: λs = λs1, Λ1 = Λ, we get the potential in
the following form

s, λ1, λs1, Λ1) and the U(1)-soft-breaking terms (m2

11, m2

2λ1

with all parameters real. We shall call the model with this choice of parameters,
cSMCS [19].

Note, that this potential (2.8) is similar to the potential with two real singlets,
with an additional Z2 symmetry for the one singlet ﬁeld, considered in paper [16].
However, in that model CP violation is not possible as there are no cubic terms in
the potential.

2.2 Positivity conditions

In order to have a stable minimum, the parameters of the potential need to
satisfy the positivity conditions. The potential should be bounded from below, i.e.
should not go to negative inﬁnity for large ﬁeld values. As this behavior is dominated
by the quartic terms, the cubic terms will not play a role here. Thus the following
positivity conditions will apply

λ1, λs > 0, Λ > −√

2λ1λs.

(2.9)

2.3 Extremum conditions

The extremum conditions lead to the following constraints:

Various spontaneous symmetry breaking extrema are possible, among them with
vanishing one or two of vacuum expectation parameters v, w1, w2. Here we concen-
trate on the case with v, w1 and w2 diﬀerent from zero, allowing for a vacuum with
violation of CP.

2.4 The CP violating vacuum

When v and both w1, w2 are diﬀerent from zero an important relation can be

obtained by subtracting equation (2.12) from the equation (2.11), namely [19]

We will consider the following mass hierarchy Mh1 < Mh2

The rotation matrix R = R1R2R3 depends on three mixing angles (α1, α2, α3).

The inverse of R can be used to obtain the reverse relation between hi and φi.

The element (11) of both rotation matrices are equal to

R(11) = R−1

(11) = c1c2.

Two important relations can be read from the above rotation matrices, namely:

h1 = c1c2φ1 + (c3s1 − c1s2s3)φ2 + (c1c3s2 + s1s3)φ3

and

φ1 = c1c2h1 − c2s1h2 − s2h3.

(3.7)

(3.8)

These relations describe the composition of the SM-like Higgs boson h1 in terms of
the CP-even (φ1 and φ2) and the CP-odd (φ3) components. It signals the CP mixing
in the model.
In the Sec. 4 we use these equations to perform a scanning of the
relevant regions of parameters. We shall treat h1 as the 125 GeV Higgs boson.

4 Allowed regions of parameters for CP violating vacuum

In what follows, we present results of a numerical analysis of the allowed regions
of parameters of the cSMCS model, with the CP violating vacuum, in agreement with
the positivity and extremum conditions as well as the perturbativity conditions. We
assume v being bounded to the region

246 GeV < v < 247 GeV

and that the mass of the lightest Higgs particle h1 lies in range

Mh1 ∈ [124.00, 127.00] GeV,

(4.1)

in agreement with recent LHC results for the Higgs boson [25]. We take masses of
two additional, heavier Higgs scalars to be [18]

Mh3

(cid:38) Mh2 > 150 GeV.

(4.2)

The parameters of the Higgs sector are varied in the following ranges:

− 1 < Λ < 1,

0 < λs < 1, −1 < ρ2,3 < 1,

0 < ξ < π,

(4.3)

where we used dimensionless parameters ρ2,3 = κ2,3/w.

From assumption that M 2
h1

range of λ1 to be :

≈ m2

11 ≈ λ1v2, and Mh1 ≈ 125 GeV we estimate

0.2 < λ1 < 0.3.

(4.4)

In order to have an appropriate range for the parameter v we set the ranges of
remaining quadratic variables as follows:
− 90000 GeV2 < µ2

11 < 90000 GeV2.

(4.5)

1, µ2

2, m2

The range of values of vev for the singlet, w, was not set in the analysis - it
was derived from the scan. The obtained allowed regions for quartic parameters and
masses are shown in Fig. 3. In Fig.3a, the allowed region of Λ versus λs is shown.
We got strong constraints on the singlet self coupling λs, to be greater than 0.2,
and on the doublet-singlet coupling |Λ|, to be below 0.2. Note, that the constraints
of Λ and λs arise mainly from the mass limits (4.1). The positivity condition can
constrain only the region of negative Λ, as follows from (2.9). This is shown as a light
shadowed region in the plot. Figs. 3b and 3c show the allowed regions of masses for
h2 and h3, respectively. For higher λs larger masses are possible, respectively up to
650 and 800 GeV. Larger values of quadratic parameters |µ2
2|, beyond the range
given in (4.5), would lead to larger allowed masses for scalars h2, h3.

1|,|µ2

The allowed regions for the cubic parameters ρ2 and ρ3 are important from point
of view of CP violation (2.13), they are shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4a shows the allowed

– 8 –

by scan over parameters the (R2, R3) region. Note, that it reproduces roughly results
presented on Fig.2a, obtained solely from the extremum conditions (2.13). In Figs.
4b,c the allowed regions of the phase ξ versus ρ2,ρ3 are presented. In both panels
there are two allowed regions, symmetric with respect to ξ ∼ π/2, with a gap around
the central value ξ = π/2 (which corresponds to w1 ≈ 0).

The result of the scanning over other potential parameters are shown in Fig. 5. In
the ﬁgure 5a the allowed regions of the (w, v) plane are presented. The vev of singlet
w reaches the highest value of 800 GeV, however the most points are concentrated
at low value of w (2 - 50 GeV). This is related to the fact that we limit λ1 ≈ m2
11/v2
(4.4), what leads to the small w according to the equation (2.10). Domination of
small w is seen also in the Fig.5c, where the allowed region of w as a function of Λ
is shown as well as in Fig.5d, where the w as a function of m2
11 is presented. Here,
the concentration of points is observed for value of m2
11, close to the mass square of
the SM Higgs boson, as expected. The allowed regions of ξ versus Λ is presented in
Fig. 5b, where a symmetry and a gap for ξ ∼ π/2 is seen in the ξ distributions, as
discussed above.

The allowed regions of masses of the Higgs bosons h2 and h3 are shown in Fig.
6, once more showing the symmetry and the gap in the ξ distribution. The maximal
values of masses are around 650 GeV (h2) and 800 (h3) GeV can be reached for ξ
around 1 and symmetrically around 2 radians (ie. for ξ equal 1.5±0.5 radians).

5 J-invariants

In this section we estimate the amount of CP violation in the considered cSMCS
model using the Jarlskog invariants. C. Jarlskog has been introduced such quantity

presented.

versus ξ.

originally for the quark sector [20]. It has been shown that the Jarlskog invariants can
be used for the scalars to ﬂag the existence of the CP-violation in an extended SM
[21–23]. For 2HDM the discussion of these invariants was performed in eg. [8, 10, 26].
If the Jarlskog quantity, i.e. J1, is diﬀerent from zero then there is a CP violation
in the model. The J1 can be deﬁned in terms of mixing terms of the squared mass
matrix elements as follows:

J1 = M12M13(M22 − M33) + M23(M 2

13 − M 2
12),

(5.1)

which for vacuum state with CP violation, described by the equation (2.13), is equal
to

J1 = 2Λ2v2w2m2

4 sin ξ cos ξ = 2Λ2v2w1w2m2
4.

(5.2)
So, in order to have J1 (cid:54)= 0 the non-vanishing complex vev of a singlet is needed as
well as the U(1)-violating quadratic term - m2
4. As follows from eq. (2.13), nonzero
value of m2
4 leads to the non vanishing of at least one cubic term for the singlet.
Further - a interaction between a doublet and singlet is necessary. It is well know
that in the SM the J1 invariant is of the order of 10−5 [3]. The Fig. 7 shows the range
of the dimensionful (GeV6) invariant J1 for the considered model. By normalizing it
by v6, as we choose v to represent temperature of the EW phase transition TEW , we
get the highest value for |J1/v6| around 10−3. It can be larger for larger m2
4.

Remaining invariants J2, J3 do not lead to the additional conditions for the spon-

taneous CP considered here.

6 Comparison with data

In the considered cSMCS model we examine the SM-like scenario with the light-
est neutral Higgs particle being the 125 GeV Higgs particle observed at LHC. Not
only mass, but also direct couplings to fundamental particles should be close to the

ones measured at the LHC. Below we collect main formulas and constraints from the
model as coming from the LHC data on 125 GeV Higgs bosons and measurement
of oblique corrections. Here we present also a short discussion on prediction of the
model for the EDM. We ﬁnish this section by presenting 7 benchmarks.

6.1 Properties of h1 Higgs boson in light of LHC data

The couplings of the lightest Higgs particle (h1) to the quarks and the gauge
bosons in the cSMCS model, as compared with the corresponding couplings of the
SM Higgs, are modiﬁed (suppressed) by a factor R11 (Eq.(3.6). In particular, for the

Higgs boson decay into vector bosons (V = Z, W ) we have
11Γ(HSM → V V ∗).

Γ(h1 → V V ∗) = R2

(6.1)

Further constraints on the parameters of our model can be obtained by comparing
the decay of the light Higgs boson h1 and of the SM Higgs boson into γγ. This is
done using the signal strength Rγγ:

Rγγ =

σ(gg → h1)
σ(gg → HSM )

BR(HSM → γγ)

Γ(h1 → gg)
Γ(HSM → gg)

taking into account that the production of the Higgs bosons in the LHC is dominated
by the gluon fusion processes and that the narrow width approximation can be

11Γ(HSM → gg).

Γ(h1 → gg) = R2

(6.3)

The main contribution in the one-loop coupling of h1 to photons is due to the W
boson and top quark, and therefore in our model the corresponding amplitude and
the decay rate are equal to:

) → Γ(h1 → γγ) = R2

where ghihj hj is the coupling between Higgs bosons, see Appendix (8.4) for corre-
sponding expressions. In the considered model the signal strength for γγ for h1 as
well as for h2, h3 can only be smaller then (or equal to) 1.

6.2 Oblique parameters S, T, U

The additional particles introduce corrections to the gauge boson propagators
in the SM that can be parametrized by the oblique parameters S, T and U . The
oblique parameters in cSMCS model, following the method introduced in [28], are
described in the Appendix 8.2. Below, we show that chosen by us benchmarks are
in agreement with current data for S and T .

6.3 EDM

The radiative corrections coming from the contributions of the additional Higgs
particles in the Barr-Zee diagrams for EDM [27] turned out to be zero because in our
model the scalar singlet does not couple with the SM fermions and pseudoscalar-like
Yukawa coupling, that results in the EDM, is absent in our model.

6.4 Benchmarks

Here we present 7 benchmarks showing agreement with the above mentioned
constraints.
In particular all benchmarks points are within 3 sigma in agreement
with data on S and T. Properties of benchmarks are presented in table 1 and 2.
Note, that only benchmark points A6 and A7 corresponds to relatively light (mass
below 200 GeV) Higgs bosons h2 and h3 and only these two benchmarks arise from
negative Λ, as presented in Fig. 8.

7 Conclusion and Outlook

In this paper we present the cSMCS - an extension of the Standard Model con-
taining a complex singlet with a non-zero complex vev, which allows for the sponta-
neous CP violation. Within our model diﬀerent vacuua can be realized, here we have
focused on the case with the CP violating vacuum. We have derived a simple con-
dition for existing of such vacuum, and found that at least one cubic term is needed
in order to have spontaneous CP violation.
In the model there are three neutral
Higgs particles without deﬁnite CP properties. The model can easily accommodate
the SM-like Higgs, with mass around 125 GeV, in agreement with LHC data and
measurements of the oblique parameters. In this respect we conﬁrm basic results ob-
tained for the Higgs sector already in the paper [18], within a larger framework with
additional inert doublet. Note however, that in the present scan we keep w parame-
ter as a free parameter and perform more detailed analysis of allowed parameters of
the model and their correlations. This analysis shows that CP violation arises in our
model from the scalar interactions between a doublet and a singlet, quadratic m2
4
term as well as cubic terms, κ2 and/or κ3 of the potential and of course complex vev
of the singlet. The calculated Jarlskog invariant J1, normalized to v6, can reach value
10−3. The singlet-fermion interactions is realized only through mixing of singlet with
the doublet and pseudoscalar-like Yukawa coupling is absent in our model, so the
prediction for EDM does not exceed the corresponding SM prediction. We provide
seven benchmarks, in agreement with collider data, for future tests of the model.
