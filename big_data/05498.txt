Achieving string stability with nonlinear control inspired by a

PDE

Arash Farnam∗ & Alain Sarlette†

March 18, 2016

Abstract

This paper deals with the problem of string stability of unidirectionally interconnected
systems with double-integrator open loop dynamics (e.g. acceleration-controlled vehicles).
We propose a nonlinear coupling law derived as an appropriate discrete space approxi-
mation of a partial diﬀerential equation (PDE), namely the Korteweg-de Vries equation.
We argue that string instability, an unavoidable shortcoming of linear controllers, could
thus be avoided as the stable propagation behavior of the Korteweg-de Vries equation
carries over to the discretized system. Besides some formal arguments in this sense, we
present simulation results showing that our nonlinear controller favorably compares to
a (failing) linear control and saturation-based nonlinearity. The results use a notion of
string stability whose nonlinear implications are somewhat adapted.

1 Introduction

Consider the task of coordinating N identical vehicles moving on a line, where each of them
is separated by a small distance from its front and rear neighbors. The open-loop model
of each vehicle is a double integrator, in accordance with positions as output and forces
(cid:39) accelerations as input. This platooning problem, commonly called the vehicle chain,
is relevant e.g. for automated highway systems, as eﬃcient control allows smaller inter-
vehicular distance which improves the capacity of a highway. Hence, during the recent years
numerous works have considered the vehicle chain problem with diﬀerent control strate-
gies [Chu(1974), Klinge(2008), Sheikholeslam and Desoer(1990), Levine and Athans(1966),
Swaroop and Hedrick(1996), Ploeg and Shukle(2014)]. Most of the standard methods to de-
sign local controllers for the interconnected systems can guarantee input-to-output stability,
but would lead to string instability.

Deﬁnition 1 : The vehicle chain is string stable if given any  > 0 there exists a σ > 0 such
that (cid:107)u(cid:107)L2
<  independently of the number of vehicles N ,
where u, yi and d are respectively the perturbation injected at the input of the ﬁrst vehicle,
the position of the ith vehicle, and the desired distance between consecutive vehicles.

< σ ensures (cid:107)yN − yN−1 − d(cid:107)L2

Since its deﬁnition in [Swaroop and Hedrick(1996), Swaroop(1994)], string (in)stability

has attracted a lot of discussion. Among others, it is well known since [Swaroop and Hedrick(1996),
Swaroop(1994)] that string stability cannot be achieved in a homogeneous string of intercon-
nected systems if the following assumptions hold:

• the dynamical controller does not cancel any of the two poles at zero frequency;
• each vehicle is connected only to a restricted set of ‘nearest neighbors’ which is inde-

pendent of N ;

• the coupling is unidirectional , i.e. each vehicle’s behavior (input information) can only

depend on vehicles in front of itself ;

• relative measurements, i.e. each vehicle i can only measure its relative position yi − yj
to other vehicles j, from which it can get a noisy estimate of relative velocity; however,
it has no access to its absolute position yi or velocity ˙yi;

• the control law is linear and time-invariant.

When the ‘set of neighbors’ reduces to one directly preceding vehicle, a quick proof of this
fact follows essentially a variation of the Bode integral for the transfer function from vehicle
i to i + 1; due to the relative measurements, the latter indeed takes the form of a sensitivity
function. For bidirectional coupling, the connection to only one preceding and one following
vehicle has also been shown to unavoidably imply string instability in conjunction with the
other above assumptions [Barooah and Hespanha(2005)].

To achieve string stability, one of these assumptions at least must be relaxed. We should
keep the ﬁrst one, because it is well known that pole cancellation leads to systems that are not
robust. The second assumption is essential for a controller that is scalable to large networks.
Several researchers have relaxed the unidirectional coupling constraint, yet from the result
of [Barooah and Hespanha(2005)] one would doubt if this can solve the problem. We here
want to keep unidirectionality, for the sake of information ﬂow from front to rear of the chain
that is naturally present in moving vehicles. The fourth assumption, relative measurements,
has been relaxed in a “time headway policy” formulation, see ([Chien and Ioannou(1992)];
[Klinge and Middleton(2009)]; [Ploeg and Shukle(2014)]) and other recent papers. Time head-
way measures the distance from the tip of one vehicle to the tip of the one behind it in terms
of the time it will take for the trailing vehicle to cover this distance. Computing time headway
in a controller requires to know the absolute velocity (although still not the absolute position)
of the trailing vehicle. The authors prove that, while keeping all the other assumptions above,
using a suﬃciently large time headway allows to bound independently of N the norm of the
transfer function from error signal on the ﬁrst vehicle to induced disturbance on vehicle N . In
[Rogge and Aeyels(2008)] the same conclusion was already reached, assuming that absolute
velocity was inﬂuencing the vehicle dynamics through drag present in the open-loop model.
In absence of (known lower bounds on) such drag, the use of absolute velocity in the controller
requires an external static reference system common to all the vehicles. There are some situa-
tions where this is not so obvious (GPS outage, underwater, aerial, space ﬂight) and disposing
of this additional measurement through more eﬃcient control would make sense.

Hence in the present paper, we relax the last assumption. The robustness of nonlinear
controllers relying on a saturation term has been considered in ([Hao and Barooah(2013)])
both for the bidirectional and unidirectional cases where the vehicles are interconnected with

2

their nearest neighbors. Monte Carlo simulations show that the ratio from the input injected
at the ﬁrst vehicle to the motion of the last vehicle grows through the vehicle chain much
more slowly than in the linear case; however a string stability analysis or related design prin-
ciples are not addressed explicitly in ([Hao and Barooah(2013)]) and (see Section 6 below) the
system is not “string stable”, even according to our revised deﬁnition for nonlinear systems.
In contrast, we derive a nonlinear control law from the Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV),
which is a nonlinear partial diﬀerential equation (PDE) of third order. This equation was
ﬁrst derived in studies of shallow water waves ([Korteweg and Vries(1895)]) and authors have
characterized so-called soliton solutions of the KdV equation, i.e. perturbations which prop-
agate along the spatial direction without deformation, in particular with amplitude stable
to small disturbances ([Dorren and Snieder(1996)],[Dorren (1996)]). This property inspired
us to use the KdV equation as a basis for a hopefully string stable vehicle chain. The KdV
equation has also been used to model traﬃc jams in another context, where the absolute
velocity of each vehicle is added to the controller ([Monteil et.al (2014)]). We here employ a
nontrivial appropriate ﬁnite diﬀerence method, looking only at vehicles in front, to spatially
discretize the KdV equation towards a nonlinear control law for a discrete set of vehicles with
unidirectional coupling and without relying on absolute velocity terms.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces a slightly relaxed deﬁnition for
string stability of nonlinear systems. Section 3 presents the Korteweg-de Vries PDE and
the vehicle chain model to be controlled. Section 4 explains how a nonlinear controller for
the vehicle chain is derived from the Korteweg-de Vries PDE. In Section 5 we analyze the
resulting vehicle chain behavior with approximation arguments, and in Section 6 we provide
further evidence for string stability through simulations.

2 Re-deﬁnition of String Stability

The notion of string stability proposed in Deﬁnition 1 is not best suited for nonlinear systems.
Indeed, requiring string stability for  inﬁnitesimal would conﬁne the system to a very small
neighborhood, where it should be equivalent to its linearization. Thus at that scale the
impossibility result for linear systems applies, such that nonlinear eﬀects can have no beneﬁt
towards string stability with inﬁnitesimal . However for all practical purposes, being able to
guarantee conﬁnement to an a priori selected ﬁnite  would appear as a reasonable robustness
objective. We hence propose a new deﬁnition of string stability where the controller tuning is
allowed to depend on  (but still not on N ). For simplicity of notation in all the following, we
also introduce a constant change of variables such that the desired reference is yk − yk−1 = 0
for all k, e.g. in the vehicle chain we make the change of notation yk → yk − k · d.

Deﬁnition 2 : A system parameterized by control parameters c is string stable if given any
 > 0 there exists a σ > 0 and a controller tuning c, independent of the number of vehicles

< .

< σ ensures (cid:107)yN−1 − yN(cid:107)L2

N , such that (cid:107)u(cid:107)L2
For the linear case this is equivalent to Deﬁnition 1, since if (cid:107)u(cid:107) < σ implies (cid:107)yN−1−yN(cid:107) <
¯ for some particular c then (cid:107)u(cid:107) < (/¯)σ implies (cid:107)yN−1 − yN(cid:107) <  for any  > 0 and the
same c. In the nonlinear case however, (cid:107)yN−1 − yN(cid:107) might converge to some limit value that
depends on c, but not on N nor essentially on the input disturbance σ — think of e.g. a
stable limit cycle. If adapting c can scale down the amplitude of that limit arbitrarily, then
we would accept the situation as string stable.

The solution v(η, τ ) of the PDE will describe the corresponding value of the wave at place
η ∈ R and at time τ ∈ R. Using the typical short notations

This PDE is nonlinear because of the product in the second term and is of order 3 through
the third term. The parameters β and γ are just scaling factors. The KdV equation (1) has
propagating soliton solutions of the form

where z = η − Cτ . Propagation velocity C and η0 depend on the initial condition and
boundary behavior at η = 0. Note that more “peaked” solitons also propagate faster.

We target this pure transport PDE behavior as a closed-loop model for the vehicle chain
— at least for the solitons with values of C smaller than some bound, which are approximable
by a space discretization. Considering a chain of N vehicles, the spatial independent variable
η is replaced by the discrete vehicle index i = 1, 2, ..., N , while the output yi(t) at index i
denotes the ith vehicle’s position at time t, replacing y(η, τ ). We model each vehicle as a
double integrator:

¨yi = ui

(3)

where, in a decentralized control architecture with unidirectional coupling, the control input
ui (force) applied to the ith vehicle should depend only on its relative position and relative
velocity with respect to a few preceding vehicles. The transition from PDE to vehicle chain
requires an appropriate discretization, which is discussed next.

4 Nonlinear control design from the Korteweg-de Vries equa-

tion

In this section we provide a nonlinear control design procedure towards satisfying string
stability, by making the link from KdV equation to the chain of vehicles. Furthermore, we
prove how to adapt the coeﬃcients of the resulting nonlinear controller in order to attain an
arbitrarily small  > 0 in Deﬁnition 2, provided the strategy works for some given ¯ > 0.

4.1 Nonlinear Control Design Procedure

The following is inspired by [Palais(2000), p.49-p.50]. To link the KdV equation to the vehicle
chain, we must get a second-order time derivative. To this end we make a ﬁrst substitution
v = yη in the KdV equation (1):

yητ (η, τ ) + βyη(η, τ )yηη(η, τ ) + γyηηηη(η, τ ) = 0 .

equals (4) up to a term proportional to hyτ τ which we will intentionally keep very small (see
next section).

We discretize this equation in space with an appropriate ﬁnite diﬀerence method looking
only at vehicles in front. The parameter h is taken as discretization step to map the vehicle
label (NB: not position) to points in x-space:

yx (cid:39) yi−yi−1

For λ = 0 the approximation of yxx is accurate up to terms of order h4yxxxx and this is enough
for the nonlinear part of the controller; but for the linear part we must use a more accurate
expression, which is obtained by λ = 1. Substituting this into (5) we get:

for i = 5, 6, ..., N . The resulting control law clearly satisﬁes the assumptions of local control,
relative measurements, no poles cancellation, and unidirectional coupling for a second-order
integrator system. The KdV equation features a large invariant space, so to damp relative
modes we may add a term proportional to relative velocity:

(8)

Since each vehicle governed by (8) requires information from up to 4 vehicles in front, other
evolution laws must be given for the 4 ﬁrst vehicles. These other laws have no inﬂuence on
string stability, as long as they lead to L2-bounded signals y2, y3, y4 for any L2-bounded signal
y1.

4.2 Eﬀective controller tuning

The following fact is a direct consequence of a rescaling of variables in (8).

Proposition 1 Consider the nonlinear controller (8) with β(cid:48) = β1 and the four leading
vehicles undergoing motions ¯y1(t), ..., ¯y4(t), and denote by ¯yN (t) the corresponding motion
of vehicle N , starting with ¯yk(0) for k = 5, 6, ..., N . Then the nonlinear controller (8) with
β(cid:48) = αβ1 and leading vehicles undergoing motions ¯y1(t)/α, ..., ¯y4(t)/α features the solution
¯yN (t)/α for the motion of vehicle N when starting with ¯yk(0)/α for k = 5, 6, ..., N .

This result implies that if the controller in the ﬁrst case satisﬁes (cid:107)¯yN−1 − ¯yN(cid:107) < (cid:48) with
some possibly large (cid:48) > 0, for all N and any leading vehicle motions satisfying (cid:107)¯yi−1− ¯yi(cid:107) < σ,
i = 2, 3, 4; then by multiplying by α the gain associated to the nonlinear term in the controller
we can ensure (cid:107)¯yN−1− ¯yN(cid:107) < (cid:48)/α for all N when (cid:107)¯yi−1− ¯yi(cid:107) < σ/α, i = 2, 3, 4, for any α > 1.
Thus for any imposed  > 0, we can ﬁnd a value of α and a bound on allowed leading vehicles’
disturbances such that the system satisﬁes (cid:107)¯yN−1 − ¯yN(cid:107) < (cid:48)/α =  for all N . In other words,
we have shown that we can make the system string stable according to Deﬁnition 2, provided
for some controller gain it is “string bounded”. Although a full proof of the latter condition
is currently elusive, we provide several supporting arguments in the remainder of the paper.

5 Stability of the resulting system

In this section we provide a partial analysis of the discrete space system described in (8). More
precisely, we combine results on the KdV equation, which we approximate for slowly varying
signals, and a linearized error equation investigation for high frequency signals. Strictly
speaking this is not a full analysis of string stability — especially since (i) the superposition
principle does not hold for the nonlinear equation (8) and (ii) the deﬁnition of string stability
requires to check all L2-bounded signals. However, the following arguments, in conjunction
with the simulation results of Section 6, are good indications for the satisfactory performance
of our controller.

5.1 Slowly varying perturbations

The objective of this section is to argue that (7) is a good approximation of the KdV equation
for slowly varying motions of the leading vehicles. Hence, the string stability induced by the
stable transport behavior of the KdV dynamics should hold, at least for those signals.

To this aim, we go back from (7) to the PDE but keeping all error estimations in the

Taylor developments:

ytt = ω(h2yxx + h4
−(γ + ω)( h4
−β(cid:48)(2h3yxyxx + h5

12 yxxxx + h6
12 yxxxx + h6

360 yxxxxxx + O(h8))
360 yxxxxxx + O(h8))

6 yxyxxxx + h5

3 yxxyxxx + O(h7)) .

(9)

This is relevant if we select a small h, compared to the characteristic length of the solutions
y(x, t) of the PDE corresponding to a particular boundary condition. It is in this sense that

6

the leading vehicles must induce slow perturbations. Working back the change of variables
(η, τ ) ↔ (x, t), equation (9) assumes the form
24β(cid:48)

yτ τ + O(h3) .

The ﬁrst line of (10) represents the KdV equation with v = yη. Hence we want to show that
under some conditions, the other terms can be seen as small perturbations.
We will therefore assume that the system follows a soliton solution of the KdV equation.
Since the soliton solution is a function of z = η − Cτ , the order of magnitude of yτ τ is C
times the order of magnitude of yτ η. For the corresponding terms in (10), we have h2
12ω yτ τ of
order Ch2/ω times yτ η. Hence the term in yτ τ can be viewed as a small perturbation with
respect to the KdV term in yτ η provided Ch2 is small. Similarly, plugging in the form (2), we
can establish that the order of magnitude of (X1) is (X2) times the magnitude of (X3), with
respectively

((X1),(X2),(X3)) ∈ { (yηyηηηη, Ch
(yηηyηηη, Ch
(yηηηηηη, Ch

β(cid:48) , yηηηη)
β(cid:48)γ , yηyηη)
β(cid:48)γ2 , yηyηη) } .

Hence if we take Ch and h suﬃciently small, in equation (10) the associated perturbative
terms (X1) are all strongly dominated by a (X3) term from the target KdV equation.

The theory of singular perturbations on PDEs would have to be used to rigorously justify
that we can neglect such dominated terms. However, it is current practice in PDE discretiza-
tion that such terms can be safely neglected for stable schemes. Involving a higher number
of neighboring vehicles in the control law would allow better approximations in this sense; in
the PDE discretization this would be called a scheme of higher order.

The fact that the motion of the leading vehicle(s) must belong to L2 readily excludes sin-
gular soliton solutions of the KdV equation ([Dorren (1996)]) and therefore a typical solution
takes the form (2). Moreover, it has been proved ([Dorren and Snieder(1996), Dorren (1996)])
that (2) describes a stable solution of the KdV equation, as eﬀects of dispersion and nonlin-
earity cancel each other. Linearization shows that the discretized scheme (7) is also a stable
system for input y1 (although maybe not string stable, i.e. the transfer function to yN is
bounded but not independently of N ). Under these conditions, we argue that it is legitimate
to say:

Proposition 2 For a given β(cid:48), γ, ω in the vehicle chain control law (7), there exist suﬃ-
ciently small ¯h > 0 and ¯C > 0 such that: If the motion of the leading vehicles is compatible
with a (succession of ) soliton solution(s) (2) with |C| < ¯C of the KdV equation (1) with
β > 24β(cid:48)/¯h, then we can expect the vehicle chain (7) to approximate a solution implied by the
KdV soliton behavior.

It is worth detailing what this actually implies on the vehicles for a soliton solution of (1).
The actual requirements come down to having a small C/β, small 1/β and small h. First, this

7

implies a small amplitude of the soliton, which means that the controller, with ﬁxed values of
β(cid:48), γ and ω, must be written in coordinates for y in which perturbations are expected to be
small (e.g. kilometers). Second, it implies a slow variation of the soliton proﬁle as a function
of z. The change of variables yields

√
z = x + (h

ω − Ch3/(24

√

ω))t ,

(11)

where individual vehicle indices i = 0, 1, 2, ... correspond to x = 0, h, 2h, .... Hence as a
function of space, we retrieve the intuitive condition of good discretization, namely that a
characteristic length of the soliton should cover a large number of vehicles. The velocity
of propagation between vehicles is |(
ω. As a
function of time, the variation of the state of an individual vehicle is thus slow, through the
small variation of the soliton solution between neighboring vehicles.

ω))|, hence dominated by

√

√

√
ω − Ch2/(24

A surprising eﬀect of the change of variables is that those slow solitons propagate from
back to front of the chain, i.e. a constant z in (11) means that x decreases as t increases.
Hence a starting “bump” of the leading vehicle would not even propagate through the whole
chain, but rather be evacuated readily through the ﬁrst vehicles. This surprising behavior is
conﬁrmed in simulations of (7), see Fig. 1. This can be understood as a very special reaction
of the following vehicles, which somehow “predict” a future soliton motion of the leaders.
Correctly predicting solitons, and only solitons, on the basis of a small interval of the leaders’
trajectory, might seem counterintuitive and fragile but it is not logically impossible. Indeed
nothing prevents a short interval of the leaders’ trajectory from being uniquely mapped to
timings and amplitudes of solitons.

Figure 1: Motion of ten following vehicles under (8) when the leading vehicles follow an inte-
grated soliton solution, which takes the form atanh(·). The soliton appears to move backward
as the nonlinear reaction of followers transforms ever tinier soliton-compatible ﬂuctuations of
their leaders into solitons that switch ever earlier.

Quick motions of the leading vehicles would not be compatible with the well-approximated
soliton solutions of the KdV equation. This is in fact favorable since at high frequencies
perturbations shall actually be damped, as we show next. The physical situation — e.g. con-
sidering the associated power — justiﬁes to expect that high-frequency variations of the
leading vehicles would have small amplitude; hence we consider a linearized model.

constants for k > 1, as we linearize with δei = ei − ¯ei around ¯ei, approximating ai := ¯ei − ¯ei−1
as a static situation. The determining factor

characterizes a stable transfer function, provided b ≥ 0 and an additional condition (γ−11ω)
24β(cid:48) >
ai−1−2ai which relates our controller tuning and the expected state around which we linearize
the vehicle chain. The conditions for Proposition 2 favor a lower value of β(cid:48). Hence given
a typical bound on |ai−1 − 2ai|, it is plausible to satisfy the conditions for stability of the
linearized system by choosing β(cid:48) not too large and γ − 11ω > 0 large enough.

The norm of the Tk can be larger than 1 at low frequencies (e.g. see s = 0 and ai = 0),
implying string instability if this linear part was the full control law. At high frequencies,
the Tk all converge to zero (like 1/s for T1 and like 1/s2 for T2, T3, T4). This is the typical
low-pass-ﬁlter situation of linear controllers: at high frequencies there is no string stability
problem, but at low frequencies it is unavoidable. However, if a nonlinear system is string
unstable, then the linear approximation becomes invalid as a perturbation grows along the
chain, such that at those (low) frequencies the nonlinear dynamics must be considered. For
the latter, Section 5.1 argues that a string stable KdV-like behavior is obtained. We can thus
conclude:

Proposition 3 For small high-frequency perturbations of the leading vehicles, the control law
(8) is string stable, from its linearized form, provided b ≥ 0, γ > 11ω, and β(cid:48) is chosen small
enough with respect to a bound on |3¯ei−1−¯ei−2−2¯ei| in the state around which we linearize. For
low-frequency soliton-compatible perturbations, Proposition 2 applies and guarantees string
stability.
The condition involving β(cid:48) might at ﬁrst appear incompatible with Proposition 1. This is
however not true: we are here analyzing the situation for a given β(cid:48); and once this is settled,
Proposition 1 guarantees exactly the same but rescaled behavior when β(cid:48) is modiﬁed.

A full proof of string stability would require to show that those or similar arguments can
cover all cases of leader behaviors, or to apply another adapted method for nonlinear systems.
This is ongoing work. The following simulations motivate research towards such a proof.

6 Simulation

The approximations made in the previous sections call for a thorough checking of actual
results. We will compare the performance of our nonlinear control law (8) to the saturation-
based controller of [Hao and Barooah(2013)] and to a linear controller, which typically uses
the relative position of one vehicle in front, e.g. with constant k, b > 0:

¨yi = −k(yi − yi−1) − b ( ˙yi − ˙yi−1) .

(13)

We recall (see Section 1) that any such linear controller looking at an arbitrary ﬁxed number
of preceding vehicles would provably be string unstable.

To prove that (8) is string stable, we would have to simulate its behavior for every L2-
bounded input. This is clearly not possible, but it seems reasonable to expect a relevant
result if we let the input be random — after all, if the system is “robustly string unstable”,
a component that is ampliﬁed along the chain should emerge. For the linear system, the
situation is clearer: a random input shall contain a frequency that is ampliﬁed along the
chain, and which remains by linearity whatever the rest of the signal. Furthermore, we can
only check how a signal seems to get ampliﬁed along a necessarily ﬁnite chain. This result
should at least be relevant for practical purposes.

Hence in our simulations, random motion errors are assigned to the four leading vehicles,
denoted el1 to el4, as shown on Fig.2. The resulting motion errors of the following vehicles
e1, e2, e10, ..e40 are shown on Figures 3 and 4 respectively for our nonlinear controller and for
the linear PD controller (13). The parameters are chosen to be γ = 200, β(cid:48) = 80, ω = 10,
b = 1; and k = 50. On Fig.3, the signals ek obtained with our nonlinear controller appear to
stay bounded, while for the linear controller (13) they keep increasing as shown on Fig.4. The
latter is in accordance with the impossibility to get string stability with a linear controller.
The low-pass ﬁlter type behavior of the vehicle chain is also visible.

To quantify the string stability, we use like in ([Hao and Barooah(2013)]) the expected

It has been proven
([Swaroop and Hedrick(1996), Swaroop(1994)]) that this is unavoidable for any linear con-
troller.

where E(.) denotes the expectation over random leading vehicle inputs, T is a suﬃciently large
time such that transients die out and δ0 is the L2 norm of the random input. In the linear
case, RF T L is exactly the H2 norm of the transfer function from the ﬁrst to the last vehicle.
We have computed the estimate RF T L for T = 4000(s) through Monte Carlo simulations for
both linear and nonlinear controllers. Figure 5 shows RF T L versus number of vehicles N for
a ﬁxed δ0 = 0 and with γ = 200, β(cid:48) = 80, ω = 10, b = 1; and k = 50. For our nonlinear
controller (8) the ratio appears to converge to a constant value, hinting at string stability,
while in contrast the ratio for the linear controller (13) and for the saturation-based nonlinear
controller of [Hao] = ([Hao and Barooah(2013)]) keeps growing with N . We have furthermore
checked (ﬁgure omitted due to space constraints) that taking e.g. β(cid:48) = 400 and dividing the
disturbance inputs by a factor ﬁve, the limit reached by (8) on Fig.5 is as well divided by ﬁve.

7 Conclusion

We have proposed a nonlinear controller for a chain of vehicles with double-integrator dy-
namics. This controller is inspired by the Korteweg-de Vries partial diﬀerential equation, to
which we apply an appropriate coordinate change and a discretization which ﬁnally requires
each vehicle to have relative measurements with respect to the four closest front vehicles. We
argue how this controller could avoid the string instability featured by any linear controller
under the same circumstances. Although a full proof of string stability is currently lacking,
simulation results conﬁrm a promising behavior. Compared to the impossibility result in
the literature, we hence seem to achieve string stability, by (i) using relative positions, (ii)
looking at a ﬁnite number of neighbors, (iii) looking only at vehicles in front, (iv) avoiding
pole cancellation, but (v) replacing the linear by a nonlinear controller and slightly adapting
the deﬁnition to allow this fact to become a game-changer. It is to inform the design of this
nonlinear controller that we refer to the Korteweg-de Vries equation.

Preliminary investigations show that similar results can be obtained by discretizing other
nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations. In the PDE-analogy context, of course control from
boundary conditions is also an interesting research direction, see e.g. ([Meurer and Krstic (2011)]),
although this is not our focus. The general idea behind our paper is rather to show how PDEs
can inspire the design of nonlinear coupling in networked controllers in order to obtain par-
ticular behaviors. Besides for its stabilizing properties, this could be used to get speciﬁc
nonlinear responses to distributed stimuli — e.g. propagating solitons with the Korteweg-de
Vries equation, think of a vehicle chain that has to circumnavigate an obstacle on its path; or
mimicking interesting phenomena taken from meta-materials. For completeness we must note
that design of distributed systems’ coupling from linear PDEs has already been proposed in
several papers, amongst which ([Hao et.al (2009)]) provides interesting conclusions towards
vehicle chains (although not string stability nor the just mentioned possible features since the
resulting controller is linear).
