Some results on the ξ(s) and Ξ(t) functions associated with

Riemann’s ζ(s) function. ∗

Abstract

We report on some properties of the ξ(s) function and its value on the critical line, Ξ(t) = ξ (cid:0) 1

2 + it(cid:1).
First, we present some identities that hold for the log derivatives of a holomorphic function. We then re-
examine Hadamard’s product-form representation of the ξ(s) function, and present a simple proof of the
horizontal monotonicity of the modulus of ξ(s). We then show that the Ξ(t) function can be interpreted
as the autocorrelation function of a weakly stationary random process, whose power spectral function
S(ω) and Ξ(t) form a Fourier transform pair. We then show that ξ(s) can be formally written as the
Fourier transform of S(ω) into the complex domain τ = t − iλ, where s = σ + it = 1
2 + λ + it. We then
show that the function S1(ω) studied by P´olya has g(s) as its Fourier transform, where ξ(s) = g(s)ζ(s).
Finally we discuss the properties of the function g(s), including its relationships to Riemann-Siegel’s ϑ(t)
function, Hardy’s Z-function, Gram’s law and the Riemann-Siegel asymptotic formula.

Key words: Riemann’s ζ(s) function, ξ(s) and Ξ(t) functions, Riemann hypothesis, Monotonicity of the
modulus ξ(t), Hadamard’s product formula, P´olya’s Fourier transform representation, Fourier transform
to the complex domain, Riemann-Siegel’s asymptotic formula, Hardy’s Z-function.

1 Deﬁnition of ξ(s) and its properties

The Riemann zeta function is deﬁned by

ζ(s) =

∞

Xn=1

n−s,

for ℜ(s) > 1,

(1)

which is then deﬁned for the entire s-domain by analytic continuation (See Riemann [15] and Edwards [3]).
In this article we investigate some properties of the function ξ(s) 1 deﬁned by (see Appendix A)

The function ξ(s) is an entire function with the following “reﬂective” property:

ξ(s) =

s(s − 1)

π−s/2Γ(s/2)ζ(s).

If we write

ξ(1 − s) = ξ(s).

s = σ + it = 1

which implies that ξ(s) is real on the “critical line.” Thus, if we deﬁne a real-valued function

the Riemann hypothesis can be paraphrased as “The zeros of Ξ(t) are all real,” which is indeed the way
Riemann stated his conjecture, now known as the Riemann hypothesis or RH for short.

By applying Laplace’s equation to ℑ{ξ(s)} and using (6), we readily ﬁnd

Thus, it follows that ℑ{ξ(s)} must be a polynomial in λ of degree 1 in the vicinity of λ = 0, viz.,

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)λ=0

where b(t) is a function of t only, independent of λ.

Similarly, by applying Laplace’s equation to ℜ{ξ(s)} and using the Cauchy-Riemann equation:

ℑ{ξ(s)} ≈ b(t)λ,

for λ ≈ 0,

and using (9), we ﬁnd that the real part of ξ(s) is a polynomial in λ of degree 2:

2.2 The Product Formula for ξ(s)

Hadamard [5] obtained in 1893 the following product-form representation

(15)

(16)

using Weirstrass’s factorization theorem, which asserts that any entire function can be represented by a
product involving its zeroes. In (16), the product is taken over all (inﬁnitely many) zeros ρn’s of the function
ξ(s), and B is a real constant. Detailed accounts of this formula are found in many books (see e.g., Edwards
[3], Iwaniec [7] Patterson [13] and Titchmarsh [18]). Sondow and Dumitrescu [16] and Matiyasevich et al.
[11] explored the use of the above product form, hoping to ﬁnd a possible proof of the Riemann hypothesis.

By taking the logarithm of (16) and diﬀerentiating it, we obtain

From the deﬁnition of ξ(s) in (2), we have

By using ζ ′(0)/ζ(0) = log(2π), and Ψ(1) = Γ′(1) = −γ (where γ = 0.5772218 . . . is the Euler constant), we
determine the constant B as

B = log(2π) − 1 − 1

2 log π − γ/2 = 1

2 log(4π) − 1 − γ/2 = −0.0230957 . . . .

(20)

Davenport ([1] pp. 81-82) derives an alternative expression for B. The reﬂective property of ξ(s) gives

the identity

Note that the two summed terms in the parenthesis in the ﬁrst line of the above cancel to each other, because
if ρn is a zero, so is 1 − ρn. To obtain the ﬁnal expression in the above, we use the property that when
ρn = σn + itn is a zero, so is its complex conjugate ρ∗
n = σn − itn, thus we enumerate zeros in such a way
that ρ∗

n = ρ−n.

By substituting (23) back into (16), we obtain

(26)

Thus, we arrive at the following theorem concerning the monotonicity of the |ξ(s)| function, which Sondow
and Dumitrescu [16] proved in a little more complicated way based on (16) instead of (24). Matiyaesevich
et al. [11] also discuss the monotonicity of the ξ(s) and other functions.

Theorem 2.1 (Monotonicity of Modulus Function |ξ(s)|). Let σsup be the supremum of the real parts of all
zeros:

σsup = sup

n {σn}.

Then the modulus |ξ(σ + it)| is a monotone increasing function of σ in the region σ > σsup for all real t.
Likewise, the modulus is a monotone decreasing function of σ in the region σ < σinf , where

σinf = inf

n {σn} = 1 − σsup.

Proof. It is apparent from (26) that |ξ(s)| is a monotone increasing function of σ in the range σ > σsup ≥ 1
for all t. Because of the reﬂective property (3) it then readily follows that |ξ(s)| is a monotone decreasing
function of σ in the range σ < 1 − σsup ≤ 1
2 .

2 , and negative for σ < 1

Thus, if all zeta zeros are located on the critical line, i.e., if σsup = σinf = 1

2 , the derivative of the modulus
|ξ(s)| is positive for σ > 1
2 . Thus, we have shown the necessity of monotonicity of the
modulus function |ξ(s)|, which has been one of major concerns towards a proof of the Riemann hypothesis.
Corollary 2.2 (Monotonicity of Modulus Function |ξ(s)|, if the Riemann hypothesis is true). If all zeta
zeros are on the critical line, the modulus |ξ(σ + it)| is a monotone increasing function of σ in the right half
plane, σ > 1

2 . Likewise, the modulus is a monotone decreasing function of σ in the left half plane, σ < 1
2 .

Proof. The above discussion that has led to this corollary should suﬃce as a proof.

3.2 The kernel function S(ω) as a power spectral function.
The kernel S(ω) deﬁned by (54) is positive for all ω ≥ 0, because D(x) is positive for x ≥ 1. Therefore,
S(ω) can qualify as a spectral density function of a certain wide-sense stationary (a.k.a. weakly stationary)
process, and we can interpret Ξ(t) as its autocorrelation function (see e.g., [10] p. 349). In this context,
the Fourier transforms between the spectrum S(ω) and the function Ξ(t) are what is known as the Wiener-
Khinchin theorem (a.k.a. the Wiener-Khinchin-Einstein theorem). The inverse transform to (57), given
below by (61), exists when Ξ(t) is absolutely integrable.

The Fourier transform representation (57) has been studied by George P´olya [14] and others (see e.g.,
Titchmarsh [18], Chapter 10). Dimitrov and Rusev [2] give a comprehensive review of the past work on
“zeros of entire Fourier transforms,” including P´olya’s work.

From the above observation that S(ω) is positive for ω ≥ 0, we can readily establish the following

proposition:

The variable t of the complex variable s = σ + it = 1

2 + λ + it is often called the height in the zeta function
related literature. In view of the Wiener-Khinchin theorem (57) and (61), it may be appropriate to interpret
t as “time” and the variable ω of S(ω) as the “(angular) frequency.” Then, we may refer to the complex
number τ deﬁned by (52) as “complex-time.” Use of the complex-time τ allow the compact representation
(55) given earlier, viz.

ξ(s) =Z ∞

0

S(ω) cos(ωτ ) dω.

(71)

This interpretation of Riemann’s result (48) will shed some new light to the Fourier transform representation
of the ξ(s) function. We will further discuss this in a later section.

4 Further results on the Fourier transform representation

4.1 Decomposition of S(ω)

In the Fourier transform representation (55) the kernel function S(ω) can be expressed as

with

where

S(ω) =

Sn(ω),

∞

Xn=1

Sn(ω) = 8πe5ω/2Dn(e2ω),

Dn(x) = n2(n2πx − 3

2 )e−n2πx.

The Fourier transform can therefore be written as a summation of inﬁnite components, i.e.,

with

ξ(s) =

fn(s),

∞

Xn=1

Sn(ω) cos(ωτ ) dω

fn(s) =Z ∞
= 8πZ ∞

0

e5ω/2Dn(e2ω) cos(ωτ ) dω.

0

(72)

(73)

(74)

(75)

(76)

The switching in the order between the summation over n and the integration over ω, as used in (76) and

N

(75), can be justiﬁed, because the series

Sn(ω) uniformly converges to S(ω) as N → ∞ in the entire
range ω ≥ 0. Note also that in the range ω ≥ 0, S(ω) is predominantly determined by its ﬁrst components
S1(ω), leaving Sn(ω), n ≥ 2 negligibly smaller. However, any attempt to replace S(ω) by S1(ω) in an eﬀort
to prove the Riemann hypothesis would fail, as argued by Titchmarsh (see [18], Chapter 10, p. 256).

Xn=1

4.2 The Fourier transform of S(ω) in −∞ < ω < ω.
Now let us consider the Fourier transform of S(ω) deﬁned over the entire real line −∞ < ω < ∞, instead of
the positive line ω ≥ 0. Note that the kernel S(ω) of (54) extended to the range −∞ < ω < ∞ is symmetric,
i.e.,

S(−ω) = S(ω), − ∞ < ω < ∞,

(77)

which can be shown using Jacobi’s identity (47). See [9] for a derivation of (77).

The Fourier transform representation (55) can then be rewritten as

ξ(s) = 1

2Z ∞

−∞

S(ω)eiωτ dω = 1

2Z ∞

−∞

S(ω)eω(s− 1

2 ) dω.

(78)

Since the kernel S(ω) is a symmetric real function, we can readily derive the reﬂective property ξ(1−s) = ξ(s)
and thus ξ(s) is real on the critical line.

The kernel Sn(ω) of (73) can be written as

with

Sn(ω) = 8πn2e

5ω

2 D1(n2e2ω)

D1(x) = (πx − 3

2 )e−πx.

Furthermore, we can write Sn(ω) in terms of S1(ω) as follows:

Sn(ω) =

1
√n

S1(ω + log n), n = 1, 2, 3, . . . .

By substituting (72) and (81) into the above, we obtain

ξ(s) = 1

Note that the functions ξn(s) are individually complex functions even on the critical line, since Sn(ω) are
not symmetric functions, thus ξn(s)’s do not enjoy the reﬂective property that their sum ξ(s) does. If we
deﬁne

ξn(s) = 1

2 [ξn(s) + ξn(1 − s)] = 1

this function is reﬂective and

4.3 Properties of the g(s) function

In this section we discuss some properties of g(s) deﬁned by (85), and its relations to the Riemann-Siegel
function and Hardy’s Z-function.

We set s = 1

2 + it in g(s) and deﬁne real functions a(t) and b(t):

Then, we can write

By deﬁning two real functions r(t) and ϑ(t)

we can rewrite (92) as

g(cid:0) 1
2 + it(cid:1) = − 1
2(cid:0)t2 + 1
r(t) = − 1
ϑ(t) = b(t) − t

The function ϑ(t) of (93) is called the Riemann-Siegel theta function, and the function Z(t) deﬁned by

is often referred to as Hardy’s Z-function [6], which is real for real t and has the same zeros as ζ(s) at
s = 1
2 + it, with t real. Thus, locating the Riemann zeros on the critical line reduces to locating zeros on the
real line of Z(t). Furthermore,

Consider the following Stirling approximation formula for Γ(s):

|Z(t)| = |ζ( 1

2 + it)|.

Then it is apparent that

G(t) = A(t) cos ϕ(t), and ˆG(t) = A(t) sin ϕ(t).

For suﬃciently large t ≫ 1, θ(t) ≈ π

The function A(t) is strictly positive for all t, hence G(t) becomes zero only when ϕ(t) = nπ + π
2 for some
integer n. Similarly, ˆG(t) crosses zero only when ϕ(t) = nπ for integer n. Thus, the number of zeros N (T )

(106)

The same result should hold for the number of zeros N (T ) of ˆG(T ) in (0, T ). The above N (T ) agrees to the

asymptotic “Riemann-von Mangoldt formula” for the number of zeros of ζ(cid:0) 1
of zeros of ξ(cid:0) 1

2 + it(cid:1) (and hence the number
2 + it(cid:1), as well), which Riemann conjectured in his 1859 lecture and proved by von Mangoldt

Gram [4] observed in 1909 that zeros of Z(t) and zeros of sin ϑ(t) alternate on the t axis, with some few
exception (see Edwards [3] p. 125). His observation is consistent with our analysis given above that the

number of zeros ˆG(t) = A(t) sin ϕ(t) = −A(t) sin ϑ(t) in the interval [0, t] is asymptotically equivalent to that
of ζ( 1

2 + it) (and hence that of Ξ(t) as well). If we deﬁne the complex function

z(s) =

ξ(s)
r(t)

,

then z(s) is reﬂective. Furthermore z(cid:0) 1

2 + it(cid:1) = Z(t), because (94) and (95) imply

Z(t) =

Ξ(t)
r(t)

.

Let Gn(t) denote the value on the critical line of ξn(s) deﬁned in (89), i.e.,

(107)

(108)

Gn(t) = ξn(cid:0) 1

2 + it(cid:1) = 1
