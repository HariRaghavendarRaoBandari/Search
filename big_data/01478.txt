We discuss a new phase space method for the computation of quantum expectation values in
the high frequency regime. Instead of representing a wavefunction by its Wigner function, which
typically attains negative values, we deﬁne a new phase space density by adding a ﬁrst-order Hermite
spectrogram term as a correction to the Husimi function. The new phase space density yields
accurate approximations of the quantum expectation values as well as allows numerical sampling
from non-negative densities. We illustrate the new method by numerical experiments in up to 128
dimensions.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Wigner functions are phase space functions
that represent quantum states [1]. Among their
important properties is the exact correspon-
dence for expectation values via phase space in-
tegration. However, Wigner functions in gen-
eral attain negative values. This phenomenon
of “negative probabilities” also poses numerical
problems when discretizing the phase space in-
tegrals by Monte-Carlo methods.

Spectrograms are a large class of non-negative
phase space functions that result from coarse-
graining the Wigner function by convolution
with another Wigner function [2]. The most
prominent spectrogram is the Husimi
func-
tion [3], which is obtained by convolving with
the Wigner function of a Gaussian. The draw-
back of the coarse-graining is the loss of the ex-
act correspondence for expectation values.

Following the ideas of [4], we add ﬁrst or-
der Hermite spectrograms to the Husimi func-
tion. The resulting new phase space density is a
linear combination of probability densities that
approximates the Wigner function more accu-
rately than the Husimi function, particularly

in calculating the expectation values of observ-
ables.

We proceed as follows. After a brief review
of the relationship between expectation values
and Wigner and Husimi functions as well as of
spectrograms in §II, we construct the new den-
sity in §III and present supporting numerical
experiments in §IV.

and 10−1.

the phase space symbol of the quantum state,

(cid:99)Wψ ∝ |ψ(cid:105)(cid:104)ψ|,

see e.g. [1, 5–7] or the monograph [8, §3].

B. Phase space densities

Apart from Gaussian states, Wigner func-
tions attain negative values and usually exhibit
strong oscillations; see the illustration in Fig-
ure 1. Hence it is diﬃcult to sample phase space
points with respect to Wψ for the Monte Carlo
quadrature of the integral (2). Our goal is to
replace Wψ by a new phase space density with
the following properties:

• the new density is built from smooth prob-
ability densities, so that (2) is amenable
to positive sampling strategies;

• the new density approximates the Wigner
function, so that (2) is exact for quadratic
observables and holds approximately with
a small error in general.

It is well-known that Husimi functions and
spectrograms are analytic probability densities,
but only provide exact expectation values for
linear observables. However, an appropriate lin-
ear combination of Hermite spectrograms re-
sults in a phase space density that fulﬁlls both
our requirements.

C. Spectrograms and Husimi functions

Non-negative phase space representations can
be obtained by coarse-graining of the Wigner
ψ : R2d → [0,∞)
function. The spectrogram Sφ

window function φ : Rd → C is deﬁned as the
convolution

Whenever ψ and φ are L2-normalized, Sφ
ψ is a
smooth probability density on the phase space.
Spectrograms are widely used in time-frequency
analysis; see e.g. the introduction of [2].

The most popular spectrogram is the Husimi

function,

Hψ := Sg0

ψ = Wψ ∗ Wg0,

(3)

3

see e.g. [3, 9], where the window is a Gaussian
function

and then we conclude from (3) that

g0(x) := (πh)−d/4 exp(− 1

2h|x|2).

III. A NEW PHASE SPACE DENSITY

We Taylor expand the Gaussian in the con-

volution deﬁning the Husimi function

Substituting this expression into (2) yields

where the error depends on fourth and higher
order derivatives of A. We take a closer look at
the Laplacian ∆Hψ. Consider the rescaled ﬁrst
order Hermite functions

ϕj(x) = (πh)−d/4(cid:113) 2

h xj exp(cid:0)− 1

for j = 1, . . . , d. A direct calculation provides a
ﬁrst order Laguerre function in |z|2/h,

Wϕj (z) = −(πh)−d(1 − 2

for z = (z1, . . . , zd) ∈ R2d; see also [10]. Thus,

as a linear combination of the two smooth prob-

(6)

The error term in (6) vanishes whenever A is a
polynomial of degree less or equal to three. By
including higher order Hermite spectrograms,
one can derive similar densities that give exact
expectation values for higher order polynomial
observables; see [11].

B. Explicit formulas for µψ

One can ﬁnd formulas for µψ when the state

is a Gaussian wavepacket, ψ = gz ,

gz(x) :=(πh)−d/4 exp( i

h p · (x − 1

2 q))

× exp(− 1

2h|x − q|2)

centered in z = (q, p) ∈ R2d, a Gaussian super-
position, ψ = gz1 +gz2 , or a harmonic oscillator
eigenstate, ψ = ϕk, k ∈ Nd; see [4].

For instance, a Gaussian wave packet gives

rise to the density

µgz (w) = (2πh)−d(cid:16)

mial prefactor — the density µgz lies between
the Wigner and the Husimi function.

For Gaussian superpositions one has

µgz1 +gz2

+ e−|z1−z2|2/8hc1,2 (7)
where c1,2 is an oscillatory interference term;
see Appendix A. Due to the exponentially small
prefactor e−|z1−z2|2/8h the cross term may be
neglected for numerical computations whenever
the two centers z1 and z2 are suﬃciently apart
from each other.

IV. NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS

A. Accuracy: Gaussian superposition

In a ﬁrst set of experiments we implement
a Quasi-Monte Carlo discretization of our new
method (6) in two dimensions with Halton
points; see also [4]. We test the accuracy for
a Gaussian superposition ψ = gz1 + gz2, z1 =
(−1, 1, 1, 1), z2 = (0, 1,−1,− 1
2 ), with varying
values of h and the following observables:

• torsional potential: 2 − cos((cid:98)q1) − cos((cid:98)q2)
• quartic momentum: |(cid:98)p|4

We compare the outcome with reference values
from grid based quadrature and do the same
for the Husimi method (4); see Figure 4. Since
both observables have non-vanishing derivatives
of degree four, the errors of the spectrogram
method are of size O(h2). In contrast, for the
Husimi method (4), the expectation values are
approximated with O(h) accuracy only.

B. High dimensions: Henon–Heiles

In a second set of experiments we show the
applicability of the new method in moderately
high dimensions. We consider the Henon–Heiles
Hamiltonian

Appendix A: Cross terms

For the Gaussian superposition ψ = gz1 +gz2 ,
both the Wigner function and the new density
contain an oscillatory cross term that localizes
around the arithmetic mean z+ = 1
2 (z1 + z2).
For the Wigner function, we have

Wψ = Wgz1

In comparison to the Wigner function, the cross
term of the new density is damped by the small
constant e−|z1−z2|2/8h.

centered in z = (q, p) with q1 = . . . = qd =
0.3645 and nonzero momentum p1 = 1, p2 =
. . . = pd = 0.

The Hamiltonian (cid:98)H and the state ψ consti-

tute a benchmark system for time-dependent
propagation methods; see e.g. [12, 13]. Since
the potential function Vd is a polynomial of de-
gree three, the spectrogram method (6) gives
the exact kinetic and potential energies, and all
errors are sampling errors, see Figure 5.

V. CONCLUSION

We have suggested a new phase space den-
sity for computing quantum expectation values
by taking a linear combination of spectrograms.
The new phase space density not only remedies
the diﬃculty in sampling with the Wigner func-
tion but also provides a higher-order approxi-
mation of observables than the Husimi function
