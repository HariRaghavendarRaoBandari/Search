Abstract

Optical properties of graphene are explored by using the generalized tight-binding

model. The main features of spectral structures, the form, frequency, number and in-

tensity, are greatly enriched by the complex relationship among the interlayer atomic

interactions, the magnetic quantization and the Coulomb potential energy. Absorp-

tion spectra have the shoulders, asymmetric peaks and logarithmic peaks, coming

from the band-edge states of parabolic dispersions, the constant-energy loops and

the saddle points, respectively. The initial forbidden excitation region is only re-

vealed in even-layer AA stacking systems. Optical gaps and special structures can

be generated by an electric ﬁeld. The delta-function-like structures in magneto-

optical spectra, which present the single, twin and double peaks, are associated with

the symmetric, asymmetric and splitting Landau-level energy spectra, respectively.

The single peaks due to the non-tilted Dirac cones exhibit the nearly uniform inten-

sity. The AAB stacking possesses more absorption structures, compared to the other

stackings. The diverse magneto-optical selection rules are mainly determined by the

well-behaved, perturbed and undeﬁned Landau modes. The frequent anti-crossings

in the magnetic- and electric-ﬁeld-dependent energy spectra lead to the increase of

absorption peaks and the reduced intensities. Part of theoretical calculations are

consistent with the experimental measurements, and the others need further detailed

examinations.

Introduction

Graphene is a 2D material made up of hexagonal carbon lattices [1, 2]. Since mono-

and few-layer graphene sheets were ﬁrst fabricated in 2004 [1], low-dimensional graphene-

related systems have been a great interest to experimental and theoretical studies. The

stacking orders of graphene sheets include the essential sequences of AA [3,4], AB [7–9,56],

ABC [7–11] stackings, and the particular AAB stacking [232–234]. While the AA stack-

ing conﬁguration has only been artiﬁcially made from intercalated graphite compounds,

the AB and ABC conﬁgurations are the common orders in natural graphite, respectively,

with their estimated volume fractions: 80 % and 14 % [12, 13]. The rest parts consist of

haphazardly stacked graphene sheets, called turbostratic conﬁguration [14–16]. Few-layer

graphene desired with a speciﬁc stacking conﬁguration can be exfoliated from highly ori-

entated pyrolytic graphite, and chemically and electrochemically reduced from graphene

oxide [1, 2, 17–21]. Nevertheless, chemical vapor deposition method has the advantage of

producing large-scale size of high-quality graphene sheets. Recently, large area of graphene

with high mobility and highly symmetric conﬁgurations, e.g., AA, AB and ABC, have

been found in CVD-grown samples [22–31]. The improved quality is adequate for research

experiments and industry applications [39–41]. AAB stacking and an intermediate bilayer

conﬁguration, with relative layer-layer shifts or twists, are also found and becoming an

interesting subject [44–46]. In general, synthesized graphene comprises diﬀerent kinds of

domains due to the tiny diﬀerence between the total energies of diﬀerent conﬁgurations. In-

frared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) [3,4,9,28], scanning tunneling

microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) [5–8, 11, 29–31], angle resolved photoemission

spectroscopy (ARPES) [32, 34–38, 264] , and Raman spectroscopy [10, 42, 43], are used

4

to visualize stacking domains with a namometric resolution for cases of tri-, tetra-, and

pentalayer graphene with typical or intermediate conﬁgurations.

Monolayer graphene belongs to a gapless semiconductor and possesses extremely high

carrier mobility of up to 15,000 cm2V−1s−1 [1]. P. R. Wallace has discovered that the

low-energy spectrum around the corners K and K(cid:48) in the Brillouin zone is described by

isotropically conical dispersions in the framework of the tight-binding model with nearest-

neighbor hopping integrals [47]. The conical band structure is known as a Dirac cone,

and the vertex points at K and K(cid:48) are known as Dirac points. The linear-dispersion

quasi-particles in graphene behave as relativistic Dirac fermions, with an eﬀective speed
of light (cid:39) c/300 (c is the speed of light). Few-layer graphene with speciﬁc stacking con-

ﬁgurations, e.g. AA [49, 50, 286], AB [52–54, 56–61, 262], ABC [61–67], and AAB [44],

is supposed to comprise distinct electronic energy dispersions with respect to the diﬀerent

geometric structures. This new material holds a great promise for the development of next-

generation electronic and optoelectronic nano-devices, because the electronic and optical

properties can be ﬂexibly tuned by the application of external ﬁelds and the changes of

dopants and geometric structures [39–41, 44–46, 72–74, 76–80, 173]. Stacking conﬁgurations

are experimentally and theoretically veriﬁed to have a great signiﬁcance on the magneto-

electronic and optical properties [44, 46, 81–86, 88, 89, 117–132, 134–139, 141, 144, 145, 149–

153, 155–157, 270, 274, 277, 313, 320], shedding some light on other intriguing structure-

speciﬁc physical properties, e.g., the Coulomb excitations and the quantum Hall transport

properties [158–172,174–189]. The essential properties under the previous investigations are

rather diﬀerent from those in other layered materials, conventional metals, semiconductors,

and topological insulators [190–197], and they are dominated by the interplay between the

5

external ﬁelds and the speciﬁc geometric symmetries. In this paper, we thoroughly review

the electronic and optical properties of multilayer graphene to explore the response under

external ﬁelds with respect to the speciﬁc AA, AB, ABC, AAB and sliding conﬁgurations.

In AA-stacked graphene, all the graphene sheets are identically stacked along the(cid:98)z di-

rection [83,129]. The low-energy band structure consists of several monolayer-like massless

Dirac cones [49,50,129,286]. They are exactly located at the two valleys K and K(cid:48), while the

energies of the Dirac points shift away from the Fermi energy due to the vertically projected

geometry. The absorption spectrum is, in general, a superposition of several monolayer-like

spectra because only the vertical excitations of intra-Dirac cones are permitted, regardless

of external electric and magnetic ﬁelds [129]. However, the stacking eﬀect gives rise to

an optical gap for the even-layer cases, a forbidden optical transition zone resulting from

free carriers in Dirac cones. The middle-frequency spectrum shows symmetric peaks as a

result of the saddle-point excitation channels around the M point. Such peaks are also ob-

served for other stacked graphene, as well as being a critical characteristic of carbon-related

systems. In a uniform perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld B = B0(cid:98)z, the Landau level (LL) spec-

trum behaves as several groups of monolayer-like ones [83, 84, 129]. Responsible for each

Dirac cone, the quantized LLs of each group are characterized by a set of single quantum

modes and their energies are described by a square-root dependence on B0. Therefore,

the magneto-absorption spectrum consists of several monolayer-like spectra with delta-
function-like absorption peaks following the optical selection rule of ∆n = ±1 [84, 129].

A forbidden transition region and a discontinuous threshold frequency would be revealed

for all the bilayer-like intragroup LL transitions, as a result of the Fermi level (EF = 0)

located between the two bilayer-like Dirac points. Moreover, the preservation of the optical

6

and electronic properties of the massless Dirac fermions indicates the unchanged spatial

symmetry of the chemical environments under external ﬁelds.

AB-stacked graphene is a fascinating material, which has attracted intense attention

due to the nature of massless- and/or massive-Dirac fermions, depending on whether the

numbers of their stacking layers are even or odd [52–54,56–61,262]. Of special interest is the

electronic structure that can be essentially characterized by a superposition of a monolayer-

like and a bilayer-like structures. Optical excitation channels accessible for the monolayer-

like subbands or bilayer-like subbands construct the optical spectrum [68, 130–133]. Under

an electric ﬁeld, the bilayer graphene shows a sharp peak due to new transition chan-

nels within the energy gap (up to 100 meV) [70–72, 74], and the cases of more than three

layers display enhanced semimetal characteristics attributed to the signiﬁcant overlap of

low-energy subbands [69, 74, 75, 79]. In particular, as a result of the nearly isotropic energy

dispersions around the K point, quasi-1D asymmetric peaks are revealed for the vertical

excitations between two constant-energy loops. The electric-ﬁeld-induced characteristic

peaks are also observed in other stacking systems [75]. A magnetic ﬁeld gives rise to inter-

esting phenomena of the the Landau quantization in electronic and optical properties for

the odd-layer cases of symmetry-broken graphene and for the even-layer cases of inversion-

symmetry graphene, especially for low frequencies [83,86,88,89,117,118,277]. Massless and

massive Dirac quasi-particles, respectively, reveal single- and twin-peak structures in the

monolayer-like and bilayer-like spectra [134]. The corresponding ratio of the peak inten-

sities is estimated about 2:1. In the presence of an electric ﬁeld, the magneto-excitation

channels around K and K(cid:48) separate to each other due to the LL splitting so that the channel

numbers become double than those under zero ﬁeld [83]. In addition, very few LLs with

7

a special relationship of quantum modes avoid to cross each other during the variation of

the magnetic or electric ﬁeld; they are characterized by a main quantum mode and side

modes under the hybridization of the LLs [83, 89, 125]. As a result of the multi quantum

modes, extra optical selection rules are induced for such LLs in addition to the ordinary
∆n = ±1. At certain regions of the absorption spectra, the eﬀects of the geometry breaking

and the anticrossings of inter-group LLs would trigger some special peaks without simple

relationships among the intensity, frequency and ﬁeld strength.

Few-layer ABC-stacked graphene is a semimetal [61–67]. The electronic structure is

characterized by one pair of partially ﬂat subbands near EF = 0, and pairs of sombrero-

shaped subbands near the energy of the vertical atomic interactions between nearest-

neighboring layers [61–67]. Contributed by the surface-localized states [65–67], the par-

tially ﬂat subbands give rise to a prominent peak in DOS and plays an important role in

the low-frequency optical spectrum [75,77]. An electric ﬁeld can separate the two partially

ﬂat bands and induce a new kind of transition channels within the energy gap [75, 77].

Under a magnetic ﬁeld, intergroup and intragroup excitation channels among well-behaved

LLs comprise the main part of the absorption spectrum [122, 145, 146, 343], in which the

absorption peaks show the twin-peak structure because the LL energy spectrum is asym-

metric about EF = 0 [146, 343]. Moreover, it is interesting to study the quantization

eﬀects of any two constant-energy loops in the sombrero-shaped structure, where the quan-

tized energies of the LLs are proportional or inversely proportional to the magnetic ﬁeld

strength [83, 122, 123]. This leads to many anticrossings of intragroup LLs in the ABC

stacking conﬁguration. By varying the electric ﬁeld strength, one can suppress or enhance

the degree of LL anticrossings and change the components of the main mode and side

8

modes, that is, one can induce and modulate optical channels for the progressive LLs dur-

ing a variation of the ﬁeld strength. Furthermore, the absorption spectrum is no longer

dominated by the twin-peak structure but rather by the double-peak structure under a suf-

ﬁciently large electric ﬁeld, a transition being attributed to the spatial symmetry breaking

of the LL subenvelope functions.

AAB-stacked graphene exhibits extraordinary band structure as compared to AA, AB

and ABC systems mainly due to the low symmetry of the stacking geometry [44]. In the case

of trilayer system, AAB-stacked graphene is a narrow-gap semiconductor, which presents

a pair of subbands with strong oscillatory energy dispersions near EF = 0. With the in-

creasing energy, pairs of sombrero-shaped and parabolic bands substantially appear. In the

low-frequency region, rich optical excitation channels cause many absorption peaks, some

of which show a quasi-1D symmetric divergence due to the vertical excitations between

two constant-energy loops. The LLs coming from the two valleys K and K(cid:48) are obviously

separated in the AAB-stacked graphene with broken inversion symmetry [44]. The results

present certain important diﬀerences for the state degeneracy, spacing, quantum number

and spatial distribution of the wavefunctions, as compared with the highly symmetric cases.

The lowly symmetric geometry of the AAB conﬁguration implies the easiness of triggering

complex patterns of LL anticrossings and the richness of magneto-absorption spectra. At

low energies, the oscillatory subbands can induce triple-degenerate Landau states under the

condition of three constant-energy contours. There are many prominent multi-crossings and

-anticrossings, i.e., existences of both well-behaved and perturbed subenvelope functions,

and sometimes the abnormal ones resulting from severe LL hybridizations. Accordingly,
the intergroup and intragroup LL anticrossings are both shown in the B0−dependent LL

9

spectrum for various regions, and they even coexist in a narrow region. Optical charac-

teristics resulting from either intragroup or intergroup inter-LL excitations are remarkably

diﬀerent for the K- and K(cid:48)-valley splitting states. The main reason is based on the phase

and the amplitude of LL wavefunctions.

(cid:48)
An intermediate bilayer conﬁguration is formed from AA to AB, and then to AA

, as the

two graphene sheets relatively shift to each other in the armchair direction [45]. The two

Dirac cones transform into parabolic bands from AA to AB conﬁgurations, and for a further

layer-layer shift, two Dirac cones tilting to each other by a small angle are restored in the

(cid:48)

AA

conﬁguration. It should be noticed that the two Dirac points are located at diﬀerent

wave vectors and energies once the stacking conﬁguration deviates from AA conﬁguration.

Furthermore, an eye-shaped stateless region is formed near EF = 0 as a result of a strong

hybridization of the Dirac cones. The dramatic transformation between the Dirac-cone

structure and the parabolic band structure leads to drastic changes of the optical response

under external electric and magnetic ﬁelds. The layer-layer shift has a signiﬁcant impact on

the LLs in the sliding bilayer systems. In additional to the well-behaved and perturbed LLs

stemming from the massless and massive Dirac Fermions in the highly symmetric AA and

AB conﬁgurations, some undeﬁned LLs appear to be promising in the case of a signiﬁcant

mixture of LLs as the geometry deviates from the typical conﬁgurations. However, there

is absence of any regular optical selection rule for such undeﬁned LLs, because their wave

functions display extremely irregular oscillations without a dominating quantum mode.

On the other hand, when AA

(cid:48)

conﬁguration is built, the LLs transform back to be well-

behaved, while additional optical channels and selection rules are accessible for intragroup

LL excitations within the tilted Dirac cones. In cases of diﬀerent bilayer conﬁgurations, it

10

is worthwhile to investigate the considerate shift-induced absorption peaks, which appear

in a wide range of the anti-crossing patterns in the ﬁeld-dependent energy spectrum.

Electronic properties are studied by the use of STM, STS and ARPES [5–8, 10, 11, 29–

32, 34–38, 42, 43, 264]. Isolated Dirac cones are clearly shown in the monolayer graphene

[35, 37, 38, 264]. The stacking eﬀects for the typical conﬁgurations AA, AB and ABC are

also identiﬁed by the main characteristics of the band structures. The former two, respec-

tively, show multiple Dirac-cone dispersions and a superposition of a monolayer-like and

bilayer-like dispersions, while the latter is not analogous to AA and AB conﬁgurations. On

the other hand, the deformation of Dirac cones for the AAB- and sliding bilayer conﬁgu-

rations could be veriﬁed by using ARPES. These aforementioned electronic characteristics

have also been conﬁrmed in absorption [139, 141, 144, 145, 149, 270, 274], transmission [152],

refection, Raman scattering and Rayleigh scattering spectroscopies [42, 43, 199–201, 271].

The evidence of Dirac cones has been observed for monolayer graphene in terms of the

zero threshold frequency and the linear dependence of the intensity on the frequency. The

low-frequency spectral features are also veriﬁed for the AB- and ABC-stacked samples on

SiO2/Si substrates. Furthermore, the results provide spectroscopic evidence of a tunable

gap in biased AB-stacked bilayer and ABC-stacked trilayer graphenes through the observa-

tion of new gap-induced absorption peaks, with a blue or red shift at diﬀerent gate voltages.

The gap size is compatible to the theoretical calculations based on the tight-binding model.

Transport and STS measurements also give the modiﬁed electronic properties under the

electric ﬁeld, including the enhanced semi-metal properties of AB-stacked trilayer graphene.

The E-ﬁeld induced excitations rely on the geometric structure. That is to say, veriﬁcations

on the spectral structure are worthwhile for further research to identify inter-layer atomic

11

interactions and geometric structures.

The quantized LL energies directly correspond to the prominent DOS peaks measured

in STS, where the LLs near EF = 0 have been identiﬁed for monolayer, AB-stacked bilayer

and trilayer and ABC-stacked trilayer graphenes [202–204, 206–210, 278]. Quantum Hall

transport measurements also observe the sequence of the LLs. Furthermore, the low-energy

optical transitions with speciﬁed selection rules are veriﬁed for the inter-group LLs near

EF = 0 in infrared transmission, absorption and magneto-Roman spectra. Spectral features

of the equivalent monolayer-like and bilayer-like Landau quantization are, respectively,

identiﬁed with square-root and linear dependence of the energies on the magnetic ﬁeld

strength in infrared transmission of AB-stacked trilayer graphene, and in magneto-Raman

spectroscopy of AB-stacked graphene up to 5 layers. For ABC-stacked trilayer graphene,

while QHE transport measurements show the low-lying LLs, the experimental evidence on

the inter-LL excitations, distinct from the massless and massive Dirac-fermion excitations,

is needed for further veriﬁcation. Crossings and anticrossings of LLs enrich the essential

magneto-electronic and optical properties. The former has been conﬁrmed by the shift of

plateaus in QHE measurements due to the increase in the LL degeneracy. About the latter,

one can use optical spectroscopy to identify the non-monotonic changes in the structures,

frequencies, intensities and numbers of the absorption peaks. This phenomenon is expected

to be more signiﬁcant in the low symmetric AAB-stacked and sliding bilayer graphenes. At

a suﬃciently low magnetic ﬁelds, the spectral features reﬂect band structures, such as the

symmetry, energy dispersions, atomic interactions, as well as the broken mirror symmetry

under the electric ﬁeld. These experimental results can be used to identify the stacking

conﬁgurations and the tight-binding parameters.

12

In this work, the generalized tight-binding model is developed to investigate optical

properties of graphene in magnetic and electric ﬁelds. The 2pz-dominated Hamiltonian is

built from the subspace spanned by a lot of tight-binding functions in an enlarged unit cell.

Its dimension is determined by the commensurate period of the geometric structure and

external ﬁeld. This model can be utilized in cases where many kinds of external ﬁelds are

applied, e.g., uniform [81, 82]/modulated magnetic ﬁelds [126], modulated electric ﬁelds,

and composite ﬁelds [127].

It is suitable for multi-layer graphene [83, 86, 119, 120] and

bulk graphites [335,336], with arbitrary stacking conﬁgurations. Most important interlayer

atomic interactions and external ﬁelds are simultaneously taken into account without the

need for treating either of them as a perturbation term. The Hamiltonian matrix for

determining the magneto-electric properties becomes too large for the experimental ﬁeld

strengths. By using an exact diagonalization method, the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions

of the Hamiltonian matrix are eﬃciently solved. The developed model could be further

used to understand the other essential material properties by combing the single- and

many-particle theories, such as optical spectra and electronic excitations [134, 137, 146,

158–161, 163, 164, 343]. On the other hand, the eﬀective-mass approximation is frequently

adopted to comprehend the electronic and optical properties. The low-lying energy bands

are expanded about the high-symmetry point, and then the magnetic quantization is done

for the approximate ones. The magneto-optical absorption spectra are calculated for the

AA- [85] and AB-stacked graphene [320]. Detailed comparisons between these two methods

will be made in the later discussions.

This review article broadly covers the ﬁelds related to multilayer graphene systems in the

forms of AA, AB, ABC, AAB and sliding conﬁgurations and discusses many factors aﬀecting

13

their magneto-electronic properties. Absorption spectra of multilayer graphene systems

are discussed in detail under the various stacking conﬁgurations and their competition

and corporation with the applied electric ﬁeld and magnetic ﬁeld. The main spectral

characteristics focus on the prominent structures, and number, intensity and frequency

of absorption peaks. In Chapter 2, we introduce the Peierls tight-binding model under a

electric and magnetic ﬁelds. The spectral response, used to describe the optical response,

is calculated based on the Fermi’s golden rule. We start with the monolayer graphene in

Chapter 3, and subsequently discuss the AA-stacked trilayer graphene. The symmetry-

preserved multi Dirac-cone structures are responsible for the optical absorption spectra.

Intra-Dirac-cone excitations comprise the whole frequency region of the spectra. Chapters

4 and 5 are devoted to AB- and ABC-stacked trilayer graphenes. The excitations of the

massless and massive Dirac quasi-particles dominate the former system, while the vertical

transitions between any two inter- or intra-group LLs are permitted for the latter systems.

In particular, the phenomenon of LL anticrossings in the energy spectrum is discussed and

explained by a clear physical picture, especially for the energy width of the sombrero-shaped

subbands. This leads to the corresponding non-monotonic dependence of the spectral

frequency and intensity on the magnetic ﬁeld. In chapters 6 and 7, we discuss the optical

response under eﬀects of broken inversion symmetry in AAB-stacked trilayer and sliding

bilayer graphenes. The lowly-symmetric stacking conﬁgurations trigger more signiﬁcant

LL anticrossings and cause distinct features for the K- and K(cid:48)-splitting LLs.

In the beginning of each chapter, we present the Peierls Hamiltonian and the spectral

function with respect to each system. We focus on the mechanism of optical excitations

responsible for the spectral characteristics based on the LL spectra and wave functions.

14

The electric-ﬁeld-enriched optical properties are also discussed. The optical absorbtion

experiments are available for the investigation of the layer and stacking dependence of the

magneto-electronic properties. Meanwhile, a detail comparison among these systems is also

presented in Chapter 7. Finally, Chapter 8 contains concluding remarks.

2 The generalized tight-binding model

The primitive unit cell of the honeycomb structure of monolayer graphene, marked by

the gray diamond, possesses two carbon atoms A (black) and B (red) atoms, shown in Fig.
1(a). The symbols γ0 ((cid:39) −2.6 eV) and b (= 1.42 ˚A) indicate the nearest-neighbor hopping

integral and C-C bond length, respectively. The ﬁrst Brillouin zone is shown in Fig. 1(b),

where Γ, M and K are three highly symmetric points.

17

AAABABCAABThe low-energy band structure is dominated by the π-bonding perpendicular to the

graphene plane. In the tight-binding model based on the 2pz orbitals, the Hamiltonian is a
2× 2 Hermitian matrix. The Bloch wave function can be described by a linear combination

of the two tight-binding functions of A and B sublattices (ϕA and ϕB) [47]:

(cid:88)

Ψ = ϕA + λϕB =

exp(ik · RA)χ(r − RA) + λ exp(ik · RB)χ(r − RB),

(1)

where λ = ±1 indicates the bonding and anti-bonding, and χ(r) is the normalized 2pz
orbital wave function for an isolated carbon atom. The 2 × 2 tight-binding Hamiltonian in

the nearest-neighbor approximation is expressed as:

Fermi-Dirac distribution, me is the electron mass and Γ is the phenomenological broadening

parameter. Only vertical transitions (∆k = 0) are available from the initial occupied state

nv to the ﬁnal unoccupied state nc because of the vanishing photon momentum. The

18

transition intensity is determined by the velocity matrix element M c,v

k (nc, nv), the ﬁrst

term in Eq. 2, which can be evaluated as follows in the gradient approximation

The approximation is well veriﬁed for carbon-related systems, e.g., graphene, carbon nan-

otubes, graphite, and nanographite ribbons. When M c,v

k (nc, nv) slowly varies in the Bril-

louin zone, this term can be left out of the integral in Eq.

(3), and A(ω) is therefore

approximately proportional to the joint density of states.

In the presence of a uniform perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld B = B0(cid:98)z, electronic states

are evolved into highly degenerate LLs due to the cyclotron motion of electrons. The

points of the dominating subenvelope wavefunction. The Hamiltonian can be expressed

Considering the transition intensity of optical excitations in Eq. (4), one can move the

Peierls phase term out of the summation because it changes slowly in the enlarged unit cell.

In consequence, the transition intensity M c,v

k (nc, nv) is determined by the inner product of

the diﬀerent subenvelope functions of the initial and ﬁnal states, i.e., it is proportional to

m, where c1 and c2 are constants. According to the orthogonal relationship

The generalized tight-binding model, based on the subenvelope functions of the distinct

sublattices, is suitable to study the magneto-electronic properties of multilayer graphene

with arbitrary stacking. The eﬀects of external ﬁelds and atomic interactions are simultane-

21

ously taken into account. When an electric ﬁeld is perpendicularly applied to the graphene

planes, the electric potentials are added to the site energies of the diagonal elements of the

Hamiltonian matrix. This model provides an exact diagonalization method for a band-like

Hamiltonian matrix to eﬃciently solve the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the quantized

states. It could also be utilized to comprehend the essential properties in the nonuniform

or composite external ﬁelds [128]. As to absorption spectra, they are closely related to the

Landau-level spectrum and the transition matrix elements. The spectral characteristics,

such as the prominent structures, number, intensity and frequency of the absorption peaks,

are well depicted. Moreover, the results are accurate and reliable within a wide-frequency

range.

The velocity matrix, determining the transition intensity and the selection rule, deserves

a closer examination. It should also be noted that the velocity matrix needs to be calculated

from the wavefunctions of the initial and ﬁnal states, of which the individual wavefunction

is a linear combination of the products between the subenvelop function and the tight-

binding function on each site in the magnetically enlarged unit cell. Using the gradient

approximation, one can obtain that the expectation value of the velocity matrix is simpliﬁed

as the product of three matrices: the subenvelope functions of the initial state and the

ﬁnal state, and the operator ∂H

∂k . The calculation result is proportional to the sum of the

products of the components of the the initial and ﬁnal states correlated to the nonvanishing

hopping integrals. It can be deduced that for multilayer graphene, the terms attributed

to the in-plane atomic interaction γ0 dominate the optical excitations, because intra-layer

atomic interactions are much stronger than interlayer ones. Consequently, the available

optical transitions satisfy the condition in which the quantum mode needs to be identical

22

for the A (B) sublattice of the initial state and the B (A) sublattice of the ﬁnal state on

the same layer, according to the orthogonal relationship of the subenvelope functions. The

detailed calculations are given in the following sections, as well as clear physical pictures

for explaining the magneto-optical properties.

3 AA-stacked graphene

AA-stacked graphene has the highest symmetry, in which the carbon atoms of one layer

are directly above/below those of another one. It has been artiﬁcially synthesized and is

macroscopically stable, although AA stacking conﬁguration is absent in natural graphite

due to its higher total energy [3, 9]. The low-lying multiple Dirac cones have attracted

intense interest of theoretical and experimental research [50]. In this chapter, we focus on

the optical absorption spectra in a wide energy range; the results are closely related to

the electronic band structure and the dipole transition matrix. In the absence of external

ﬁelds, the low- and middle-frequency optical properties are, respectively, dominated by

the excitations of massless Dirac fermions and saddle-point states. On the other hand,

the magneto-optical properties are dominated by inter-LL transitions that obey a special

selection rule derived from the dipole transition moment between the initial and ﬁnal

states. For all excitation channels, the linear symmetric and asymmetric superpositions of

the wave functions in diﬀerent layers are responsible for the non-zero and zero probability,

respectively, for intra- and inter-Dirac-cone transitions, regardless of external ﬁelds.

In

particular, intensity discontinuities and forbidden transition regions are revealed for certain

kinds of excitation channels. The optical spectra can be further modiﬁed by the application

of an electric ﬁeld.

3.1

Electronic and optical properties without external ﬁelds

3.1.1 Monolayer

The electronic structure of monolayer graphene is symmetric about EF = 0, as shown

by the black curve in Fig. 2(a). In the low-energy region, two Dirac-type linear subbands

24

intersect at EF = 0, with the Fermi-momentum state located at the K point. At middle
energies, the saddle-point states are located at the M point with the energies of ±α0. The
isotropic conical dispersion measured from the K point is described by Ec,v (cid:39) 3α0b(k−K)/2

according to Eq. (2), where the the conical point is deﬁned as the Dirac point and the

slope dEc,v/dk = 3α0b/2 is regarded as the eﬀective speed of light of the Dirac fermions in

graphene.

25

Figure 2: The (a) zero-ﬁeld band structures and (b) absorption spectra at low- and middle-

energy points of monolayer and AA-stacked trilayer graphenes. The shadows inset in (a)

indicate the forbidden optical transition zone.

The main characteristics of the electronic properties are reﬂected in the absorption

spectra. The spectral absorption function A(ω), Eq.

(3) is obtained by a summation

26

over all possible transitions in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone. For the excitations of the Dirac

fermions, A(ω) is simpliﬁed as a product of the joint density of states and the Fermi velocity.

Therefore, a linear dependence of the spectral intensity on the frequency appears in the

low-frequency region, while in the middle-frequency region, a symmetric peak peak in the
logarithmically divergent form is revealed at ω (cid:39) 2α0 due to the saddle-point transitions

around the M point, as shown by the black curve in Fig. 2(b). This very strong π-

electronic absorption peak is one of the critical characteristics in the carbon-related sp2

bonding systems, such as graphite [337], graphite intercalation compounds [338], carbon

nanotubes [339, 340], and carbon fullerenes [341].

3.1.2 Multilayer

The highly symmetric AA-stacked graphene is formed by perpendicularly stacking

graphene sheets along the ˆz direction. The geometric structure is illustrated on the top

right side in Fig. 1(c), where the four representative atomic interactions taken into ac-

count in the tight-binding calculations are indicated: one nearest-neighbor intra-layer in-

teraction α0 = 2.569 eV, and three interlayer interactions α1 = 0.361 eV, α2 = 0.013
eV and α3 = −0.032 eV [211]. The electronic band structure of an N -layer AA stacked

graphene comprises N sets of monolayer-like energy bands. In the trilayer case, three sets

of monolayer-like subbands, Sc,v

3 , are displayed by the red curves in Fig. 2(a);

1 , Sc,v

2 and Sc,v

one of the three sets is mapped to the monolayer case, and the other two are oppositely
shifted by energy ∼ α1. Note that three low-energy Dirac cones are located at the K point

and three saddle points at the M point. With an increase of the graphene layers, more Dirac

cones are induced while the energy diﬀerence among Dirac points decreases, as described

27

in the eﬀective-mass model by [85]

[2 cos(j + 1π/(N + 1)) − 2 cos(jπ/(N + 1))]α1,

(10)

where j = 1, 2, ......N−1. Recently, STS experiments have conformed the two Dirac cones in

AA-stacked bilayer graphene [57]. The measured slope and location of the Dirac cones are

in agreement with theoretical predictions. The multiple Dirac-cone structure for multilayer

cases can be further conﬁrmed by ARPES and STS experiments.

According to the spectral absorption function A(ω), Eq. (3), we can ﬁnd that the inter-

band excitations are only available within the same pair of energy subbnads. That is to

say, they come from intra-Dirac-cone structures, but not from inter ones. The reason is

attributed to that the Landau wavefunction is the linear symmetric or asymmetric super-

position of the subenvelope functions in diﬀerent layers, which leads to to non-zero (zero)

electric dipole moments for intra-Dirac-cone (inter-Dirac-cone) transitions, regardless of

external perpendicular electric and magnetic ﬁelds. However, a forbidden transition zone,

as indicated by shadows for the case of trilayer graphene in Fig. 2(a), is expected for the

lower and upper Dirac cones because of their respective free electrons and holes according

to the Fermi-Dirac distribution. This would lead to a discontinuity in the optical spectrum.

As a result of Dirac-fermion excitations, AA-stacked trilayer graphene also shows the

linearly dependent absorption intensity in the low-frequency spectrum (red curve in Fig.

2(b)). However, it should be noticed that due to the forbidden transition zones around the
Fermi energy (Fig. 2(a)), a shoulder structure occurs near ω (cid:119) 1 eV, which is evaluated as

a double of the energy diﬀerence between EF = 0 and the lower (higher) Dirac-point energy

or the diﬀerence between the two Dirac-point energies. The measured forbidden zone can

be used to estimate the value of α1 according to Eq. 10. The spectral intensity for ω < 1

28

eV is equal to the intensity of monolayer graphene, because only the middle Dirac cone

contributes to the optical transitions. On the other hand, for ω > 1 eV, the inter-band

transitions within all the three Dirac cones are permitted. Therefore, the linear intensity

is three times as large as that of monolayer graphene.
In the middle-frequency region
∼ 2α0, instead of one single peak for monolayer graphene, three close peaks are induced

as a result of more excitation channels around the saddle points at M point. An increase

of graphene layers gives rise to veriﬁed and diversiﬁed spectral structures in which more

steps and peaks, respectively, appear at low and middle frequencies. It should be noted

that an even-layer AA-stacked graphene possesses an bilayer-like optical gap determined

by the spacing between the valence and conduction Dirac points nearest to the Fermi level.

Previous works have shown the layer-dependent spectral structures for odd-layer and even-

layer scenarios. Nevertheless, for certain frequency regions, the cases in both scenarios

exhibit the properties identical to those of 3D graphite as the layer number exceeds the

critical values.

3.2 Magneto-electronic and magneto-optical properties

3.2.1 Monolayer

In the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld, the electronic states congregate to form dispersionless

LLs. Each LL in monolayer graphene is fourfold degenerate without the consideration of

spin degeneracy. For the states at (kx = 0, ky = 0), their corresponding wave functions

are localized around four diﬀerent centers: 1/6, 2/6, 4/6 and 5/6 positions of the enlarged

unit cell. At B0 = 40 T, the LLs and the localized wave functions are shown in Figs.

3(a) and (b), where only the 1/6-localized Landau states are discussed. In the LL energy

29

spectrum in Fig. 3(c), the conduction and valence LLs are symmetric about EF = 0,

and characterized by the quantum numbers nc,v corresponding to the numbers of the zero

points of subenvelpe functions (Ac,v
o

for 1/6-localized states). The nc,v = 0 LL (at EF = 0)

is constant as a function of B0, and the nc,v = 1, 2, 3... LLs are counted away from EF = 0;
they follow the simple square-root relationship |Ec,v

nc,vB0 which is responsible for

n | ∝ √

the Dirac-type linear dispersion.

30

Figure 3: The low-lying conduction and valence LLs and localized wave functions of mono-

layer graphene with the two distinct sublattices in the presence of B0 = 20 T. The unit of

the x-axis is m/2RB, where m indicates the m-th A or B atom in the enlarged unit cell.

The Landau wavefunctions, characterized by the subenvelope functions on diﬀerent

sublattices, are used to deﬁne the quantum numbers of LLs. The wavefunction can be

31

decomposed into odd-indexed and even-indexed components in the magnetically enlarged

unit cell as follows

|Ψk(cid:105) =

2RB−1(cid:88)

(Ao|Amk(cid:105) + Bo|Bmk(cid:105)) +

2RB(cid:88)

(Ae|Amk(cid:105) + Be|Bmk(cid:105)),

(11)

m=1

m=1

where o(e) represents an odd (even) integer. The subenvelope functions Ao,e (Bo,e), standing

for the probability amplitudes, exhibit even or odd spatial symmetry and can be described

by an n-th order Hermite polynomial multiplied with a Gaussian function. The amplitudes

are identical for the 1/6 and 4/6 localized wave functions, and so are for those 2/6 and 5/6

ones. Ac,v

o,e of the 1/6 localized state is equal to Bc,v

o,e of the 2/6 localized state and vice versa.

Moreover, the odd-indexed component has only a phase diﬀerence of π with respect to the

even-indexed component, i. e., Ac,v

o = −Ac,v

e and Bc,v

o = −Bc,v

e . Therefore, discussing the

odd-indexed components of the 2/6 localized wave functions is suﬃcient to comprehend
the LL properties. For a Landau state with the quantum number nc,v ≥ 1, the subenvelope

functions for Ao and Bo sublattices correspond to nc,v-th and (nc,v + 1)-th order Hermite

polynomials, respectively. The conduction and valence subenvelope functions are related to

each other by the following relationship: Ac

o = Av

o and Bc

o . It can be deduced that a

o = −Bv

simple linear relationship exists between the subenvelop functions Ao and Bo of conduction

and valence Landau states, i.e., Av
o(nc = nv + 1).
This accounts for the speciﬁc selection rule ∆n = nc − nv = ±1 for inter-LL transitions

o(nc = nv − 1) and Bv

o (nv) ∝ Ac

o(nv) ∝ Bc

because, according to Eqs. (8) and (9), the expectation value of the velocity matrix is

nonzero only when Av

o (Bv

o ) of the initial state and Bc

o (Ac

o) of the ﬁnal state have the same

mode.

as ωn(n+1), the ﬁrst number with underline and the second number without underline,

respectively, indicate the quantum number of the unoccupied valence LL and that of the

occupied conduction LL. The absorption intensity is the same for each peak because of the

same degree of degeneracy for each LL. Due to the band symmetry about EF = 0, the

peak indicated by n(n + 1) (n = 0, 1, 2, 3...) results from two cases of transitions: one from
nc − nv = 1 with nv = n and the other from nc − nv = −1 with nv = n + 1. Besides, the

The magnetic quantization of the N pairs of Dirac cones in an N-layer AA-stacked

graphene gives rise to N low-lying LL groups, of which the group divisions are based on

the energy spectrum and the characteristics of the spatial wave function.

In the case

of the AA-stacked trilayer graphene, the three Dirac cones at B0 = 20 T are evolved

into three monolayer-like LL patterns, as indicated by black, red and blue curves in Fig.

5. Each Landau state at a given (kx, ky) is four-fold degenerate. The conduction LLs

ﬁrst group behave the same relationship of monolayer graphene for each layer, and so does

the third group. It should be noticed that the second group of LLs has the same relationship

only in the two outmost layers, while the inner-layer subenvelop functions are empty. This

reﬂects the fact that the second group of LLs is regarded as a result of monolayer graphene,

which is consistently presented when the number of graphene is odd. It is a visible means

to identify the LLs in terms of single-mode wave functions, since there is an absence of LL

35

couplings for AA stacking conﬁguration.

Figure 5: The conduction and valence LLs and localized wave functions at 2/6 center of

of AA-stacked trilayer graphene with six distinct sublattices. The three Dirac cones at B0

= 20 T are evolved into three monolayer-like LL patterns, as indicated by black, red and

blue curves.

36

The energy distributions of three groups of LLs are related to their individual Dirac

cones that are primarily separated by the speciﬁc interlayer atomic interaction α1 [50, 85,

286]. Each group exhibits a simple square-root dependence on the ﬁeld strength and the

quantum number like the monolayer graphene. The energies of the zero-mode LLs are con-

stant as a function of the ﬁeld strength; each LL moves towards the individual Dirac-point

energy when the magnetic ﬁeld approaches zero. The Fermi energy for a constant carrier

density oscillates as a function of the magnetic-ﬁeld strength around the zero-ﬁeld value of

EF = 0 (the bold wriggling curves in Fig. 6), leading to an oscillating energy gap and the

metal-semiconductor transition. The magneto-resistance measurements are used to detect

the oscillation of the Fermi level for other 2D systems, such as FeSe and AlGaAs/GaAs het-

erojunctions [221–223]. The Fermi distribution changes with the oscillating Fermi energy,

which might cause the change on the threshold channel and frequency for each category of

intragroup LL transitions and induce a forbidden region for optical transitions. Meanwhile,

all the LLs directly cross one another, i.e., absence of LL anticrossing, and no additional se-

lection rule is induced, since each Landau state is characterized by a single-mode harmonic

function.

where they are evaluated from the derivative of Eq. (11), and the initial- and ﬁnal-state

wavefunctions. Substituting the velocity matrix into the spectral absorption function A(ω),

Eq. (3), one can ﬁnd that those terms correlated by the in-plane atomic interaction play

an important role, and the optical LL transitions are available only within the same group

(those between intergroup LLs are forbidden) [84]. Given that each LL behaves like the

massless Dirac LL, the selection rules of the intragroup-LL transitions can be ascribed
to ∆n = ±1. On the other hand, the prohibition of intergroup-LL transitions can be

attributed to that the Landau wavefunctions are the linear symmetric or asymmetric su-

perpositions of the subenvelope functions in diﬀerent layers, giving rise to a zero electric

dipole moment for the intergroup transitions.

Figure 7: The (a) magneto-absorption spectrum of AA-stacked trilayer graphene under B0

= 40 T. The second category (red dots) corresponds to a monolayer-like spectrum while

the ﬁrst (black) and third (blue) categories can be regarded as a bilayer-like spectrum. The

B0-dependent numbers and frequencies of (b) the threshold absorption peaks and (c) the

forbidden transition region are shown.

The prominent delta-function-like absorption peaks can be classiﬁed into N categories,

40

each of which owes to the individual intragroup-LL transitions and satisﬁes the particular
selection rule ∆n = ±1 (same as the monolayer). In the case of N = 3, the ﬁrst, second

and third categories of the magneto absorption peaks are indicated by black, red and

blue dots, respectively, as shown in Fig. 7(a) for B0= 40 T. The distributions of the

peak frequency and intensity with respect to each category are based on the Fermi level

and the Fermi-Dirac distributions of the conduction and valence LLs. As a result, the

second category corresponds to a monolayer-like spectrum. Nevertheless, the ﬁrst and

third categories can be regarded as a bilayer-like spectrum [134]. Outside the threshold

peaks, ω8v7v

1

and ω6c7c

3

, there exists a forbidden transition region within these two categories,

which limits transitions between two LLs opposite to the Fermi level with the quantum

numbers diﬀering by one. The forbidden region, enclosed by two peaks excited from the

Fermi level, ω8v7v

1

and ω8v7c

1

; ω6c7c

3

, and ω6v7c

3

, is evaluated as a double of the excitation

frequency between the highest occupied LL and the Fermi level, either for the ﬁrst or third

category. In general, two kinds of channels can contribute to one excitation peak due to

the symmetric distribution of the conduction and valence LLs, e. g., nc

i = n → nv

i = n + 1

and nv

i = n + 1 → nv

i = n for ωn,n+1

i

, where index n equals 0, 1, 2... and i represents a

group number. The same kind of permitted channels from three intragroup categories, i.e.,

ωn,n+1

1

, ωn,n+1

2

and ωn,n+1

3

, results in three close peaks, between which the slightly diﬀerent

frequency reﬂects the distortion of Dirac cones. However, it should be noticed that for the

four peaks neighboring the forbidden transition region, ω8v7v

1

, ω6c7c

3

, ω8v7c

1

and ω6v7c

3

, their

intensities are about a half of the others due to only one kind of channels available for the

excitations from the Fermi level.

It is useful to elaborate the magnetic quantization of AA-stacked graphene in terms of

41

the numbers and frequencies of the ﬁeld-dependent absorption peaks in the three categories,

as in Fig. 7(b). During the variation of the magnetic ﬁeld, the Dirac-fermion excitations

√

behave as the direct consequence of the

B0 proportionality of the absorption frequency.

When the Fermi level crosses two LLs in the bilayer-like groups, a discontinuity of the

threshold frequency appears accompanied by the change of the threshold channel in the
ω − B0 spectrum. As B0 is reduced, the threshold frequencies decrease in the ﬁrst and

third categories and they are dominated by larger quantum numbers, such as ω8v7v

1

and

ω6c7c

3

at B0=40 T and ω7v6v

1

and ω5c6c

3

at B0=50 T. The main reason is that the threshold

frequency contributed by the excitations from the highest occupied LL is strongly aﬀected

by the LL degeneracy which is proportional to the magnetic ﬁeld strength. That is to

say, at a constant carrier density, the weaker the magnetic ﬁeld the more the valence LLs

occupy.
In addition, the forbidden transition region also depends on the magnetic ﬁeld
strength. It converges on the frequency approximately at 2α1 (cid:39) 0.73 eV, corresponding to

the diﬀerence between two outer Dirac points (Fig. 2). With an increase of the graphene

sheets, we can classify the spectra depending on whether the numbers of the graphene

sheets are even or odd. All the categories of absorption peaks in the even-layer scenario

can be regarded as bilayer-like spectra, each with a discontinuous threshold frequency and

a forbidden transition region. Except for the monolayer-like spectrum exclusively shown

for the odd-layer scenario, all the others are bilayer-like.

3.3

Electric ﬁeld enriched optical properties

By means of applying a perpendicular electric ﬁeld E = E0(cid:98)z, one can modify the spectral

features, such as those from Dirac fermions, saddle-point states and Landau states. A

42

uniform perpendicular electric ﬁeld does not break the linear dispersions but only cause a

rigid shift of the Dirac-cone structures with a slight decrease of the linear slope. The upper

and lower Dirac cones shift to opposite directions corresponding to the middle one that is

placed at the Fermi level. The energy shift is increased with an increment of the electric

ﬁeld strength [286]. The spectral intensity is also linearly dependent on the frequency,

while it slightly increases due to the slope variation for the Dirac-type linear dispersion, as

shown in Fig. 8. However, the shoulder structure, at the doubled frequency between two

Dirac points, exhibits a blue shift in the same magnitude with respect to the enlargement

of the forbidden transition zone across the Fermi level.

43

Figure 8: The E0-enriched (a) band structure, (b) absorption spectrum and (c) magneto-

absorption spectrum of AA-stacked trilayer graphene.

44

Responsible for the Dirac-cone shift, the ﬁrst and third groups of LLs are also rigidly

shifted to opposite directions with regard to the second group. The selection rule is the

same as the case without electric ﬁeld because the quantum modes of Landau states are

unchanged and still described by well-behaved Landau wavefunctions. Consequently, the

second category of absorption peaks is almost unchanged under the inﬂuence of the electric

ﬁeld, while for the other two categories, the forbidden transition region is enlarged with

threshold frequencies and channels dominated by larger quantum numbers. In short, the

applied electric ﬁeld rarely changes the main characteristics of the absorption spectrum

because it doesn’t break the spatial symmetry in the AA stacking conﬁguration.

The aforementioned absorption spectral features can be veriﬁed by optical spectro-

scopies, such as the absorption, transmission, reﬂection, Raman scattering and Rayleigh

scattering spectroscopies. The multiple Dirac-cone dispersion is veriﬁed by ARPES in the

bilayer case [76], while the optical excitation spectrum for multilayer cases is still absent.

√

On the other hand, the previous experiments have identiﬁed the

B0 dependent frequen-

cies in the infrared transmission spectra for monolayer and AB-stacked trilayer graphene

(Chapter 4). Recently it is also observed by magneto-Raman spectroscopy for AB-stacked

graphene up to 5 layers. While the magneto-optical properties of massless-Dirac-fermions

have been observed, verifying on the multiple Dirac points in the AA stacking conﬁguration

is worthwhile for further research to identify inter-layer atomic interactions and geometric

structures.

45

4 AB-stacked graphene

ABA stacking has been known as the most stable and common stacking conﬁguration

among trilayer graphene systems, as predicted by the theoretical studies [90–95] and con-

ﬁrmed from the experimental measurements [96–100]. It is analogous to the composite of

a monolayer and a AB-stacked bilayer graphenes. The energy band structure is composed

of a pair of linear subbands and two pairs of parabolic ones near the K point. There

are three groups of valence and conduction LLs, in which the monolayer- and bilayer-like

ones, respectively, present the almost symmetric and asymmetric energy spectrum about

the Fermi level. Each LL is four-fold degenerate because of the extremely small splitting

energy, except for the three special doubly-degenerate ones, nc,v

1 = 0 and nc,v

2 = 0 & 1.

Most of LL wavefunctions belong to the well-behaved modes, and the perturbed ones

only appear in few anti-crossings. The zero-ﬁeld absorption spectrum mainly exhibits two

kinds of special structures including discontinuities (shoulders after broadening) at low

frequencies and logarithmically divergent peaks at middle frequencies. There are only

ﬁve kinds of excitation channels due to the forbidden transitions between the linear and

parabolic energy bands. Up to now, infrared reﬂection [101–103], absorption spectro-

scopies [104–106], and infrared scattering scanning near-ﬁeld optical microscopy [107] have

successfully veriﬁed the characteristic structure and the AB stacking domains.

A perpendicular electric ﬁeld can dramatically change electronic structures and thus

diversify optical properties. It signiﬁcantly modulates the subband spacings, causes the

subband hybridizations, and induces extra band-edge states. One pair of parabolic sub-

bands near EF become oscillatory ones with three circular constant-energy contours in the

energy-wave-vector space. The second pair might have the sombrero-shaped dispersions

46

with two constant-energy loops. These will lead to the asymmetric absorption peaks in the

square-root divergent form. Moreover, it is expected that the increase in the band-edge

states enhances density of states, creates extra excitation channels and enriches spectral

structures. Besides, a perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld can generate the plentiful absorption

spectra. Five categories of inter-LL excitations quite diﬀer from one another in intensity,

frequency, and structure of absorption peaks. Moreover, the magneto-absorption spectrum

can be diversiﬁed by the diﬀerence in Coulomb potential energy between graphene layers.

The four-fold degenerate LLs become double-degenerate ones so that more inter-LL chan-

nels are excited. The spectral intensity is lower with the increase of absorption peaks and

the appearance of double-peak structures.

4.1

Electronic and optical properties without external ﬁelds

The geometric structure of the AB-stacked conﬁguration is shown in Fig. 1(c), where

two neighboring layers shift relatively to each other by one bond length b along the armchair

direction. The A atoms on the odd-number layers and the B atoms on the even-number

layers have the same x-y projections, while the B (A) atoms on the odd- (even-) number

layers are located at the hexagon centers of the adjacent layer. The primitive unit cell
consists of 2 × N atoms, where N is the number of layers. The atomic interactions are

derived from the SWMcC model [14, 15], including one nearest-neighbor intralayer γ0,

three nearest-neighbor interlayer (γ1, γ3, γ4), two next-nearest-neighbor interlayer (γ2, γ5),

and the chemical environment diﬀerence γ6 between A and B atoms. Their values are listed
as follows: γ0 = −3.12 eV, γ1 = 0.38 eV, γ2 = −0.021eV, γ3 = 0.28 eV, γ4 = 0.12 eV,
γ5 = −0.003 eV, and γ6 = −0.0366 eV [14, 15].

47

The electronic properties in AB-stacked trilayer graphene can be basically regarded as a

hybridization of monolayer and bilayer properties, while the interlayer atomic interactions

play an important role on the energy dispersions in the vicinity of highly symmetric points,

as indicated in Fig 9(a). The low-energy band structure is characterized by massless- and

massive-Dirac fermions; it consists of a pair of linear subbands, labeled as Sc,v

1 , and two

pairs of parabolic subbands, Sc,v

2 and Sc,v

3 , in the vicinity of the K point. Analytic solutions

show that γ3 and γ4 modify the low-lying energy dispersions, and γ2 and γ5 separate the

intersections of the nearby subbands and inﬂuence their spacings as well [51]. Nevertheless,

a slight overlap between the linear valence band and the parabolic conduction one indicates

a gapless 2D semimetal.

48

Figure 9: The (a) zero-ﬁeld band structure of AB-stacked trilayer graphene consists of a

pair of linear subbands, labeled Sc,v

1 , and two pairs of parabolic subbands, Sc,v

2

and Sc,v
3 ,

around the K point. The (b) absorption spectrum exhibits two kinds of special structures,

discontinuities at low frequencies and logarithmic divergences at middle frequencies.

Away from EF = 0, the two subbands Sc,v
3

exhibit parabolic dispersions and they are

separated mainly by γ1, with a ﬂuctuation of γ2, γ5 and γ6. Furthermore, those parabolic

49

dispersions extend along the KM direction, with three saddle points near the M point.

It is remarkable that the energy dispersions near the K and M points give rise to special

structures in the DOS [68], and dominate the main characteristics of the absorption spectra.

Recently, the theoretical band-structure calculations have been conﬁrmed by STS and

ARPES measurements [73, 77, 79].

In the absence of an electric ﬁeld, the absorption spectrum of trilayer graphene mainly

exhibits two kinds of special structures: discontinuities at low frequencies and logarith-

mic divergences at middle frequencies, which, respectively, owes to the vertical transitions
around the K point and those around the M point (Fig. 9(b)). The 3 × 3 excitation chan-

nels are induced between three pairs of conduction and valence subbands; however, on the

basis of the symmetry characteristics of the subenvelope functions, the permitted channels

are only those completely within the monolayer-like subbands Sc,v

1 or the bilayer-like sub-

bands Sc,v

2 and Sc,v

3 . That is to say, there are only ﬁve kinds of channels accessible in the

absorption spectra, while noticeably, the optical excitations are forbidden from Sc,v
1

to Sc,v
2

or Sc,v
3 .

At low frequencies, the spectral structure is determined by the latter excitation channels,

since those between the linear bands only contribute to linearly increasing intensity. The
2 → Sc
special shoulder structure at ω ∼ 0.5 eV is due to the edge-state transitions from Sv

3

and Sv

3 → Sc

2, but otherwise the spectral intensity grows with the higher frequency. In the

middle-frequency spectrum, there are ﬁve logarithmic peaks around ω = 2γ0, coming from

the saddle points of Sc,v

1 , Sc,v

2 and Sc,v

3

subbands. Recently, infrared reﬂection spectroscopy

and absorption spectroscopy have shown a clear evidence of the characteristic structure
at ω ∼ 0.5 eV [270, 274]. Furthermore, the infrared scattering scanning near-ﬁeld optical

50

microscopy can be used to verify the AB stacking domains based on the speciﬁc conduc-

tivities [342]. The whole-frequency spectrum deserves a closer experimental examination

to verify the whole band structure and to identify the stacking conﬁguration [145].

3,kδm,m(cid:48)+1)δL,L(cid:48)±1 for even L.

The ABA stacking exhibits three unique groups of LLs which could be regarded as the

superposition of those of monolayer and AB-stacked bilayer graphenes. The ﬁrst group

of LLs, being quantized from the linear subbands, is initially formed near EF .

In the

vicinity of EF , the square-root dependence of LL energies on nc,v
is absent because of the
1
slightly distorted Dirac-cone structure with an energy spacing of ∼ 20 meV. Furthermore,

the nc,v

1 = 0 LLs are doubly degenerate and their energies are diﬀerent at 2/6 & 1/6 (5/6
1 ≥ 1 LLs, which the conduction and valence ones are almost

& 4/6) centers. The nc,v

symmetric to each other, are four-fold degenerate, similar to those of monolayer graphene.

The second and third groups come from the two pairs of parabolic subbands. The nc,v
are initiated at Ec,v ≈ 0, while the nc,v

3 ones are located at (0.57 eV, -0.6 eV). Each LL has

2 LLs

double degeneracy, mainly owing to the destruction of the mirror symmetry about the z-
plane. The energy spacing between the splitting LLs is extremely small (≈ 0.1 meV) so that

their absorption peaks will merge together. Exceptionally, the nc,v

2 = 0 & 1 LLs exhibit

the observable splitting energies of about 10 meV, accompanied with certain important

51

diﬀerences in the LL wavefunctions and magneto-absorption spectra at 2/6 and 1/6 centers

(5/6 and 4/6 ones), as indicated in Figs. 10(a)-(g). Moreover, all the LLs possess the

well-behaved spatial distributions except for few anti-crossings in the B0-dependent energy

spectrum. It is also noticed that the low-lying LLs of the ﬁrst and second groups have been

identiﬁed from the STS [5] and quantum Hall transport measurements [108–110].

52

Figure 10: The LLs and localized wave functions at 2/6 and 4/6 centers of AB-stacked

trilayer graphene with six distinct sublattices. Three groups of LLs at B0 = 40 T are

indicated by black, red, and blue colors.

There are ﬁve categories of absorption peaks in the optical spectrum, as observed in

53

the zero-ﬁeld available excitation channels (Fig. 11). The intergroup optical excitations

associated with the ﬁrst LL group are forbidden due to the simple phase relations among

six diﬀerent sublattices. The ﬁrst group only survives on (A1, B1, A3, B3) sublattices,

since the neighboring-layer atomic interaction do not make contributions to its electronic

states. Furthermore, the A1 & A3 (B1 & B3) subenvelope functions are identical for the

second and third groups whereas those of the ﬁrst group possess the opposite phases. As

to the intragroup excitations nv

1, they exhibit only single peaks with a predominantly

1 → nc

uniform intensity because the velocity matrix elements are nearly constant for the almost

symmetric Dirac-cone structure.

The second and third LL groups sharply contrast with the ﬁrst one in term of intensity,

structure, and frequency of intragroup absorption peaks. The peak intensities are nonuni-

form and only about half of that of the ﬁrst group. The magneto-absorption spectrum
presents twin-peak structures with an observable spacing of ∼ 10 meV. The diﬀerences in

peak structures can account for the lower intensity. Exceptionally, the ω2v1c

2

peak is a single

structure because of the requirement of the Fermi-Dirac distribution. Concerning the two

categories of intergroup excitations, nv
peaks obey the selection rules of |nc,v

2 → nc
2 − nv,c

3 and nv

2 display the single peaks. Such
3 | = 2 and 0, and their intensities are compara-

3 → nc

ble. In general, the intensity of the intergroup inter-LL excitations is weaker than half of

that of the intragroup ones. This is mainly due to the phase relations between the Al (Bl)

subenvelope functions of the initial states and Bl (Al) of the ﬁnal ones. For the intragroup

excitations, all the subenvelope functions of the nv initial and nc ﬁnal states on the Al

and Bl sublattices have the same (for the second group) or opposite (for the third one)

phases, resulting in to the high peak intensities. On the other hand, the complex phase

54

relations in the wavefunctions remarkably weaken the intergroup inter-LL transitions. In

short, the magneto-optical spectra at 2/6 (5/6) and 1/6 (4/6) centers are almost identical

in the main features of absorption peaks, including frequency, structure, and intensity. Es-

pecially, the optical excitations coming from the double-degenerate nc,v

1 = 0 and nc,v

2 = 0

& 1 LLs are distinct in absorption frequencies at diﬀerent centers. Such energy splitting is
observable (∼ 10 meV) and very useful in identifying the stacking conﬁgurations from the

experimental measurements.

intragroup and two intergroup categories of LL excitations under B0 = 40 T. The blue,

green, and red color numbers, respectively, indicate the excitations from the ﬁrst, second,

and third LL groups.

Experimentally, magneto-optical spectroscopies have been utilized to observe the inter-

LL vertical transitions in the ABA stacking. For the intragroup excitations of the ﬁrst LL

56

√

group, the

B0-dependence of absorption frequency and the selection rule of ∆n = ±1 are

revealed in the infrared transmission spectrum [111–113] and the magneto-Raman scatter-

ing spectrum [114–116]. In particular, the square-root and linear B0-dependent frequencies

due to the massless and massive Dirac-fermions of few-layer AB-stacked graphenes are con-

ﬁrmed by the magneto-Raman spectroscopy [114–116]. However, the other four categories

of excitation channels need further experimental veriﬁcations. The experimental examina-

tions on the main features of absorption peaks can distinguish the stacking conﬁgurations

of trilayer graphenes.

4.3

Electric ﬁeld enriched optical properties

A perpendicular electric ﬁeld signiﬁcantly modulates the low-lying energy dispersions

and optical excitation channels. It changes subband spacings, causes subband hybridiza-

tions, and induces extra band-edge states as well (Fig. 12(a)). Unlike the induction of a

signiﬁcant band gap in bilayer graphene, trilayer graphene has been shown both theoret-

ically [63] and experimentally [34] to behave as a semimetal with weakly oscillating dis-

persions near the Fermi level. Attributed to the hybridization of the linear and parabolic

subbands, the oscillation width is greatly enhanced as the applied electric ﬁeld increases.

Especially, the pair of parabolic subbands near EF become oscillatory ones, similar to the

Sc,v
1

subbands in the AAB stacking (Fig. 19 in Chap. 6, section 1). In the energy-wave-

vector space, each subband has three circular constant-energy contours associated with the

concave and convex dispersions. This will lead to the asymmetric absorption peaks in the

square-root divergence form, since such subbands could be regarded as one-dimensional

ones. Similar behavior can be observed in the sombrero-shaped bands with two constant-

57

energy loops. Moreover, it is expected that the increase in the band-edge states of the

oscillating subbands enhances the density of states, induces optical excitation channels and

diversiﬁes the low-energy optical spectra.

58

Figure 12: The (a) E0-induced subband hybridizations and extra band-edge states elec-

tronic structure of AB-stacked trilayer graphene. The (b) absorption spectrum at low-lying

frequency is also diversiﬁed by external electric ﬁeld with extra excitation channels and

multi-peak structures. The (c) absorption spectrum under the composite ﬁeld exhibits

twin- and double-peak structures.

The characteristics of the absorption spectra, such as prominent structures, and number,

59

intensity and frequency of absorption peaks, are signiﬁcantly changed under the inﬂuence

of the applied electric ﬁeld (Fig. 12(b)). Owing to the subband hybridizations, not only

the original transition channels survive, but also the extra channels are created between

the ﬁrst pair and the other two pairs of energy bands. That is to say, ﬁve kinds of ef-

fective excitation channels are changed into nine ones under the application of E. The

low-energy optical excitation channels from the ﬁeld-induced oscillatory subbands give rise

to multi-peak structures, due to multiple channels, in the absorption spectra instead of the

featureless spectra without external ﬁelds.

Accordingly, as the ﬁeld strength is larger than a moderate value ∼ 0.1 eV/layer, three

multi-peak structures appear in the low-frequency region, as shown in Fig. 12(b). The

ﬁrst, second and third peaks, as denoted by Pf , Ps and Pt, correspond to the transitions

from Sv

1 → Sc

2, respectively. The number of excitation

1, (Sv

1 → Sc

2 → Sc

2, Sv

1), Sv

2 → Sc

channels for each multi-peak depends on the number of band-edge states of the oscillatory

subbands; that is, it depends on the electric-ﬁeld strength. At E0 = 0.3 eV/layer (red

curve), each multi-peak structure consists of one main peak accompanied with one or

two weak peaks (like shoulders after broadening). However, the absorption spectra exhibit

more and sharper symmetric peaks with an increment of the ﬁeld strength, especially for Ps

which displays a rather strong symmetric peak as E0 goes up to 0.5 eV/layer (green curve).

The peak intensity is enhanced by the larger radius of the constant-energy loop (the higher

density of states). Speciﬁcally, the symmetric peak structure of Ps is the combination of two

opposite-direction asymmetric peaks due to the concave- and convex-downward subbands

1 → Sc

(Sv

2 → Sc

2, Sv

1) in Fig. 12(a). These results are in qualitative agreement with recent

transport [63] and optical experiments [98]. Furthermore, the excitation energy of the ﬁrst

60

peak Pf is nearly independent on the electric-ﬁeld strength, which is responsible for the

semi-metal properties in the trilayer case of AB stacking. The other peaks show blue shifts

with the increasing ﬁeld strength. It should be noticed that the E-induced low-frequency

absorption peaks rely on the geometric structure. By contrast, the characteristics of middle-

frequency spectra due to the π-electronic states around the M point are preserved in the

presence of electric ﬁeld.

The applied perpendicular electric ﬁeld can dramatically alter the LL characteristics

and thus diversify the magneto-absorption spectrum (Fig. 12(c)). The four-fold degenerate

LLs are replaced by the double-degenerate ones under the broken mirror symmetry about

the z-plane. Each group of LLs is split into two subgroups, in which the splitting LLs are

characterized by two diﬀerent localization centers of 1/6 and 2/6 unit cell (4/6 and 5/6 unit

cell). The dominating sublattice, in determining quantum numbers, remains unchanged

for each subgroup, i. e., there exist two inversely symmetric sublattices for two splitting

subgroups. As more inter-LL channels are excited, the absorption spectrum shows double

peaks, identiﬁed as α and β types for the inter-LL transitions from the former and the

latter subgroups, respectively (blue and purple curves). Furthermore, the anti-crossings of

the perturbed LLs are presented in the E0-dependent energy spectrum (red arrow), since

the cooperation of electric ﬁeld and certain interlayer atomic interactions can drastically

change the charge distributions in the main and side modes (details discussed in Chap

5.2). The total number of absorption peaks is greatly increased, but their intensities are

signiﬁcantly reduced. The double and the twin peaks, which, respectively, arise from the

splitting and asymmetric LL energy spectra, are simultaneously revealed in the magneto-

optical excitations. The two components in each double peak are associated with 2/6

61

and 1/6 centers, while those in a twin-peak structure only rely on a speciﬁc center.

It

should be noticed that, the inter-LL excitations between the ﬁrst group and the other ones

are recovered in the presence of E. The potential energy diﬀerences between graphene

layers result in drastic changes of spatial charge distributions; that is, the ﬁrst group of

LLs are contributed by electronic states in each layer. The existence of the second-layer

charge distribution is responsible for the enriched absorption peaks. The electric ﬁeld can

generate nine categories of magneto-absorption peaks, being absent in the AAA, ABC, and

AAB stacking systems. Also, there exist extra absorption peaks arising from the frequent

intra-subgroup LL anti-crossings. The E-induced intergroup excitation channels and extra

peaks are expected to provide more information in identifying the stacking domains from

magneto-optical measurements [134, 134, 139, 320].

The double-degenerate splitting LL energy spectrum in the ABA stacking has been

identiﬁed from the experimental measurements on the Hall conductances [320] under a com-

posite ﬁeld. The E-created diverse magneto-optical properties could be further veriﬁed by

the infrared transmission spectroscopy [152] and the Raman scattering spectroscopy [271],

in which they include nine categories of inter-LL excitation channels, the anti-crossing-

dependent extra peaks, the simultaneous appearance of the single, twin and double peaks,

and the weakened peak intensities.

5 ABC-stacked graphene

The ABC stacking is a stable conﬁguration in natural graphite [12,13]. Few-layer ABC-

stacked graphene is semi-metallic with two partially ﬂat bands slightly overlapping near

the Fermi level [65–67]. The prominent peak of DOS near the Fermi level, coming from

the partially ﬂat bands, play an important role in the low-frequency optical spectrum.

In particular, energy bands exhibit sombrero-shaped dispersions near the nearest vertical

interlayer hopping energy [61–64]. The corresponding absorption structures have been ob-

served in the optical spectrum [200]. Besides, the middle-frequency spectrum is relevant to

the band structure around the M point in the vicinity where the energy dispersions are sig-

niﬁcantly modiﬁed by interlayer atomic interactions. Under a magnetic ﬁeld, it is intriguing

within the sombrero-shaped band structure that the LLs are inversely sequenced as a func-

tion of the ﬁeld strength, leading to frequently intragroup LL anticrossings accompanied

by signiﬁcant hybridizations of LLs. [122, 145, 146, 343] In general, the inter-LL transitions
satisfy the particular selection rule ∆ = ±1 if the wavefunctions are well-behaved. How-

ever, extra optical selection rules are induced for the LLs with quantum modes in modulo

3, as a result of the LL hybridization. What could be especially needed is to focus on the

excitations within the LL anticrossing spectrum, where the diversiﬁed quantum modes lead

to the considerable peaks whose intensities are associated with the degree of hybridizations

among LLs.

Electronic and optical properties without external ﬁelds

ABC-stacked N -layer graphene consists of 2N carbon atoms in a primitive unit cell, in

Fig. 1(c). Each of the graphene sheets is shifted by a distance of b

(cid:48)

with respect to the lower

63

(upper) neighboring layer along +(−)(cid:98)x. The sublattice A of one layer is situated directly

above the center a hexagon in the adjacent lower layer, whereas the sublattice B lies above

the lower-layer sublattice A. The intra-layer and the inter-layer atomic interactions in

the tight-binding model are illustrated as βi’s, where i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4; 5. β0 represents the

nearest-neighbor intra-layer hopping integral, β1, β3 and β4 correspond to adjacent inter

layers, β2 and β5 are for next-nearest inter layers. β1 and β2 couple two vertical sites, and
β3, β4 and β5 couple non-vertical sites. Their values are listed as follows: β0 = −3.16 eV,
β1=0.36 eV, β2 = −0.01 eV, β3=0.32 eV, β4=0.03 eV, and β5=0.0065 eV.56 [15]

characterized by three pairs of conduction and valence subbands, partially ﬂat, sombrero-

shaped and linear dispersions. The optical absorption spectrum (b) around the K and M

points exhibits peak- and shoulder-structures with 9 kinds of vertical excitation channels.

The low-energy electronic properties of ABC-stacked trilayer graphene are characterized

by three pairs of conduction and valence subbands in Fig. 13(a). They display partially

65

ﬂat, sombrero-shaped and linear dispersions, as respectively labeled by Sc,v
1

(black), Sc,v
2

(red) and Sc,v
3

(blue). Being weakly dispersive in the vicinity of EF = 0, the subbands

of the ﬁrst pair, Sc,v

1 , consist of surface localized states and anisotropic around the K

point as a result of the trigonal warping [65–67]. The small energy diﬀerence between the

two localized subbands is approximated as 2β2 = 0.04 eV. Moreover, the tight-binding

calculations show that such a characteristic of the surface localized states disappears as

the wave vector is moving away from the K point. At EF = 0, the three crossing points

in a circle are identiﬁed as Dirac points [121]: one in the KΓ line and another two whose
rotation angles are relative to the former by 120o and −120o. Away from EF = 0, the
sombrero-shaped and linear subbands cross each other near K point at energies ∼ ±β1
(= ±0.36 eV), where the crossing point corresponds to a local minimum of the former
and a local maximum of the latter. In particular, within the bottom (∼0.34 eV) and tip
(∼0.36 eV) of the sombrero-shaped subband, two closed circular loops at a speciﬁc energy

leads to a doubly degenerate state with diﬀerent Landau orbitals under a magnetic ﬁeld.

This would cause unusual characteristics for certain excitation channels. Interlayer atomic

interactions also modify and diversify the band structures around β0. It is mainly caused

by β3 and β5 that some saddle-point states are distributed away from the M point over a

small energy range and some are shifted along the ΓM direction. Recently, the theoretical

band structure is experimentally conﬁrmed by STS and ARPES [73, 77, 79].

The optical absorption spectrum correlates with the particular energy spectrum in both
regions of ω < 2β1 around the K point and of ω ∼ 2β0 around the M point according

to Eq. (3), as shown in Fig. 13(b). The low-frequency spectrum is dominated by the

excitations from the former region, mainly aﬀected by the interlayer atomic interactions β1

66

and β2. There are one obvious asymmetric peak at ω (cid:39) 0.35 eV, one observable peak at
ω (cid:39) 0.68 eV and one shoulder at ω (cid:39) 0.72 eV, respectively, due to the vertical transitions

between the surface-localized and sombrero-shaped subbands, between the valence and

conduction sombrero-shaped subbands, and between two linear subbands. Speciﬁcally,

the latter two structures, with a small frequency diﬀerence, might be merged together in
optical measurements. On the other hand, 3 × 3 kinds of excitations channels from the

saddle points in the latter region induce several obvious peaks and shoulder structures for
the middle-frequency spectrum ∼ 2β0, in which the interlayer atomic interactions β3 and
β5 play an important role. There appears a prominent symmetric peak at ω (cid:39)6.21 eV,

as a result of transitions between the saddle points of the subbands Sc,v
1 . The two peaks
at ω (cid:39)6.28 eV and ω (cid:39) 6.46 eV are responsible for the saddle-point transitions of pairs
3 . Moreover, the characteristic peak at ω (cid:39)6.32 eV is associated

of subbands Sc,v
1

and Sc,v

with the saddle point of Sv

2 [200]. Recently, infrared reﬂection spectroscopy and absorption

spectroscopy have verify the low-frequency optical properties, showing a clear evidence of

two characteristic peaks associated with the partially ﬂat and sombrero-shaped subbands.

Based on the speciﬁc infrared conductivities, infrared scattering scanning near-ﬁeld optical

microscopy can distinguish the ABC stacking domains with nano-scale resolution from

other domains. Furthermore, the whole-frequency spectrum deserves a closer examination

to verify the band structure over a wide energy region and the measured features are useful

to identify the stacking conﬁguration. [145]

The magnetically quantized LLs of ABC-stacked trilayer graphene can be divided into

three groups according to three zero-ﬁeld subbands and the spatial characteristics of the

wave functions, as indicated by black, red, and blue colors in Fig. 14 at B0 = 40 T.

69

The valence and conduction LLs are asymmetric with respect to EF = 0 due to interlayer

atomic interactions. Each level is four-fold degenerate under the inversion symmetry. The
o-subenvelop functions of the 1/6− (4/6−) localized states (l = 1, 2; 3) have out of phase
Al
o-subenvelop functions of the 2/6− (5/6−) localized states. The wavefunctions

with Bl

at 2/6 unit cell are illustrated. As a result of being quantized from the partially ﬂat

subband, the ﬁrst group of LLs are initiated from EF = 0, in the vicinity of which the

ﬁrst three LLs, coming form the Dirac points, are slightly separated by the interlayer

hoppings, while the other higher-order LLs are distributed away from EF = 0 [120–122].

The dominating sublattice in the ﬁrst group corresponds to the outmost B1 sites of the

surface-localized states. Similarly, the corresponding outmost A3 sites can be used to deﬁne

the quantum numbers of the other degenerate states localized at 1/6 and 4/6 unit cell. The

quantum numbers of LLs are counted in ascending order from EF = 0 as evidenced by the

dominating subenvelope function B1

o . Meanwhile, resulting from the sombrero-shaped and

linear subbands, the LLs in the second and third groups are initiated from the intersection
energy ∼ β1 of the subbands, and their quantum numbers are, respectively, characterized

by the dominating subenvelop functions B3

o and B2
o .

70

Figure 14: The LLs and localized wave functions at 2/6 center of of ABC-stacked trilayer

graphene with six distinct sublattices. Three groups of LLs at B0 = 40 T are indicated by

black, red, and blue colors.

71

The main characteristics of the LL spectrum are relevant to the zero-ﬁeld band struc-

ture, as shown in Fig. 15. The onset energy for each group is the same as the band-state-

state energy of the respective subband near the K point. The level spacings are determined

by the DOS, that is to say, LLs are densely packed with an increment of the DOS. Ac-
cordingly, the intensive formation of the LLs near ±β1 is attributed to the crossover of the
subbands in Fig. 13. The ﬁrst and third groups present the monotonically B0−dependent

energies. Near EF = 0, the three LLs insensitive to the ﬁeld strength reﬂect the char-

acteristics of Dirac points. They are conﬁned in a small energy spacing between the two

partially ﬂat subbands, with the separated energies mainly determined by the speciﬁc in-

terlayer atomic interaction γ4. This sequence of the ﬁrst group of LLs was conﬁrmed by

the measurements of the Hall conductance [189]. However, a complicated pattern of a

non-monotonic energy dependence is shown in the second group of LLs, which are respon-

sible for the particular magnetic quantization rule relating to the sombrero-shaped energy

subbands. A considerable amount of inverted LLs is observed for the ﬁeld strength under

certain critical ﬁelds that correspond to the local minima in the spectrum.

72

Figure 15: The B0-dependent LL energy spectrum of ABC-stacked trilayer graphene. The

three LLs near EF are very insensitive to the ﬁeld strength reﬂecting the characteristics of

Dirac points. The second group of LLs related to the sombrero-shaped bands presents a

complicated pattern of a non-monotonic energy dependence.

The relationship of the inverted LLs and the critical magnetic ﬁeld is dominated by the

interplay between the magnetic degeneracy and the total states enclosed in the sombrero

73

surface, as shown in Fig. 16(a). Two kinds of B0-dependent energies correspond to two

kinds of degenerate Landau orbitals, i.e., the proportional and the inversely proportional

dependences, for the respective outer and inner circular constant-energy loops on the surface

of the sombrero-shaped subbands. A weak magnetic ﬁeld aggregates electronic states near

the vertex of the sombrero-shaped subband. Therefore, as more states on the inner surface

are magnetically quantized, the LLs display the inversely proportional energy dependence

on the ﬁeld strength.

In contrast, the magnetic quantiﬁcation associated to the outer

surface is introduced to the B0-proportional LLs. It can be deduced that at a critical ﬁeld

the whole inner-surface states are exactly quantized to the inverted LLs, and the inverse

of the critical ﬁeld strength exhibits a periodicity with the total numbers of the inverted

LLs because of the constant enclosed states. Apparently, the particular band structures

characterize the magneto-absorption spectrum.

As a signature of the ABC-stacked graphene, the magnetic-ﬁeld-dependent spectrum

exhibits many anticrossings of the second group of LLs, as shown in Fig. 16(a). The reason

is attributed to Wigner-von Neumann non-crossing rule, which indicates that two multi-

mode LLs avoid to cross each other once they simultaneously have certain identical modes.

From a qualitative perturbation analysis, the three factors, β2, β3 and β5, are deduced to

cause the hybridization among LLs. Their subenvelope functions have quantum-number

diﬀerence by the multiple of 3 [89, 122, 123, 125]. In principle, for Landau states away from

the anticrossing regions in Fig. 16(b), the subenvelope functions for all sublattices are

well-behaved and described by the Hermite-functions. For example of nc
modes for sublattices in the order of {A1

2 = 2, the quantum
o} are, respectively, 3, 4, 2, 3, 1

o, B2

o, B1

o , A2

o , A3

o, B3

and 2. It should be noticed that the two subenvelop functions established on two sublattices

74

in the same layer, e. g., A1

o and B2

o , and those on the vertical sublattices between adjacent

layers, e.g., A1

o and B1

o , are, respectively, characterized by the quantum-mode diﬀerences

of 0 and 1.

75

Figure 16: The (a) interplay between the magnetic degeneracy and the total states enclosed

in the sombrero surface. The Landau states away from the anti-crossing regions are shown

in (b).

76

At the region of LL anticrossings, the subenvelop functions are perturbed due to a

signiﬁcant hybridization with nc

3 = 0 LL according to the diﬀerence of 3 in their quantum

modes, as evidenced by the continuous change for the components of the main and side

modes in the anticrossing region. Nevertheless, away from this region, the functions convert

to well-deﬁned again, while the change of the main modes corresponds to nc

3 = 0 LL. In

addition to the well-behaved LLs, the perturbed LLs are expected to enrich and diversify the

magneto-optical properties satisfying the extra selection rules of modulo 3. What should

be especially needed is to focus on the small region under the magnetic ﬁelds weaker than

the critical strength, where the perturbed-LL transitions lead to a considerable amount of

extra peaks satisfying the optical selection rules of modulo 3. Furthermore, their intensities

are strongly increased by the degree of the hybridization among the LLs.

Feature-rich optical absorption spectrum is presented in ABC-stacked trilayer graphene,

as attributed to the particular LL spectrum. One can obtain the spectral absorption func-

tion A(ω), Eq. (3), by substituting the velocity matrix evaluated from the wavefunctions

and the derivative of the Hamiltonian over all possible transitions in the ﬁrst Brillouin

zone. It is shown that occupied Landau states in any of the three valence groups can be

excited to the three conduction groups, once the excitation channels satisfy the generalized

selection rules (see Chapter 2). The absorption peaks can be classiﬁed into nine categories

resulting from both three intragroup and six intergroup LL transitions, as shown in Fig.

17 for B0 = 40 T, where the black, red, and green color numbers, respectively, indicate the

excitations from the ﬁrst, second, and third LL groups. In general, most of the absorption

peaks exhibit the twin-peak structures as a result of the two kinds of excitation channels

with a tiny energy diﬀerence in the asymmetric LL spectrum. However, for some categories,

77

the threshold channels exclusively from the three Dirac-point related LLs, nv

1 = 0, nc,v

1 = 1,

and nc

1 = 2, give rise to the single-peak structures according to the Fermi-Dirac distribu-

tion, i. e., ω3v2c

1,1 , ω0v0c

1,3 , and ω1v2c

2,1 . The frequency spacing of twin peaks may be observable,

providing a way to verify the asymmetry between valence and conduction LLs under the

interlayer atomic interactions. On the other hand, the intensities of the absorption peaks

in ABC-stacked graphene are non-regular with the increasing frequency, in contrast to the

case of monolayer graphene in which the peak intensities are uniform and independent of

the photon frequency. The main reason is attributed to the relationship of the phase and

amplitude between the subenvelope functions, depending strongly on the stacking conﬁg-

urations.

The magneto-absorption spectrum exhibits some unusual absorption peaks due to the

transitions between the perturbed LLs in the region of the LL anticrossings, as indicated

by the dashed blue circles in Fig. 16(a). Considering the transitions from the nv

3 = 0 LL

that anticrosses with nv

2 = 1 LL, one can ﬁnd an extra twin peak at ω = 1 eV that include

the nv

3 = 0 −→ nc

2 = 3 and nv

2 = 3 −→ nc

3 = 0 excitations, in addition to the regular twin

peak at ω = 0.8 eV corresponding to nv

3 = 0 −→ nc

2 = 0 and nv

2 = 0 −→ nc

3 = 0 excitations.

Induced by the side modes of the hybridized LL (nv

3 = 0), the extra peak satisﬁes the

special selection rules of modulo 3. Moreover, the spectral intensity varies with the degree

of the hybridization. The extra peak has higher intensity when the side mode gets stronger

with an increment of B0, and the decreasing intensity reﬂects the gradual disappearance of

the side mode after B0 passes through the strongest anticrossing point [134]. It should be
noticed that, at the ﬁeld strength of the anticrossing point (B0 (cid:39) 20 T), a blue or red shift

of the twin peak also accompanies the intensity variation, because the two anticrossing

78

LLs, nc

2 = 0 and nc

3 = 1, are reversed.

The frequency dependence of the low-lying LL excitations on the ﬁeld strength deserves

a closer examination for exploring the spectral characteristics of ABC-stacked graphene.

Neither the intergroup nor the intragroup categories can be described as a simple square-

root or linear formula referred to as the behavior of monolayer or bilayer graphene, as

shown in Fig. 17(b). The single-peak channels, resulting from the speciﬁc excitations from

the three Dirac-point-related LLs, determine the threshold frequencies of the absorption

categories associated with the ﬁrst group of LLs. The twin-peak spacings, due to the

asymmetry in the LL energy spectrum, are more obvious at lower frequencies. In the ﬁrst

intragroup category, the absorption frequencies grow quickly with an increment of the ﬁeld
strength, while they approach the threshold value of ω32 (cid:39) 2β2 at a suﬃciently low ﬁeld

strength, corresponding to the energy spacing between the partial ﬂat bands along the

KΓ direction. On the other hand, the intergroup absorption peaks appear in between the

intragroup ones. At certain frequency and magnetic-ﬁeld ranges, the intergroup categories
exhibit non-monotonic (0.30 eV (cid:46) ω (cid:46) 0.35 eV; B0 (cid:46) 15 T and B0 (cid:38) 15 T) or non-
continuous (0.30 eV (cid:46) ω (cid:46) 0.5 eV; B0 (cid:39) 20, 55; 70 T’s) dependence of frequency on

B0, the peculiar phenomena closely correlating with the particular energy spectrum that

includes the inverted and anticrossing LLs. Furthermore, both the dependences can also be

observed for those higher-frequency excitation channels associated with the second group

of LLs.

Electric ﬁeld enriched optical properties

In ABC-stacked trilayer graphene, the application of a perpendicular electric ﬁeld sig-

niﬁcantly leads to the drastic changes in the energy dispersion, band gap, band spacing,

anticrossing and band-edge states shown in Fig. 18(a), as well as, enriches absorption spec-

tra with diﬀerent peak structures in Fig 18(b). As a result of the special surface-localized

states near the Fermi level, the energy gap is proportional to the potential diﬀerence be-

tween two outmost layers under a moderate electric ﬁeld. The ﬁrst absorption peak directly

reﬂects the optical gap transitions and is used to determine the value of Eg, as observed

in the AB-stacked bilayer graphene. The second peak, associated with the partially ﬂat

subband and the distorted sombrero-shaped subband, exhibits an observable blue shift. By

contrast, the spectral characteristics of AA- and AB-stacked trilayer graphene remain sim-

ilar under the electric ﬁeld. In AB-stacked trilayer graphene, E ﬁeld increases the overlap

between valence and conduction bands, and enhances the optical conductivity; in AA-

stacked trilayer graphene, it critically changes the Dirac-point energies, Fermi momenta

and Fermi velocity, and modulates the forbidden optical transition regions.

81

the drastic changes in the energy dispersion, band gap, band spacing, anti-crossing and

band-edge states. The (b) absorption spectrum is mostly remain unchanged, while the (c)

magneto-absorption spectrum is signiﬁcantly diversiﬁed with more double peaks.

82

The four-fold degenerate LLs are split into two-fold degenerate LLs because of the E-
induced destruction of the mirror symmetry in the xy−plane and the non-equivalence of

the two sublattices in identical projections. Each group of LLs becomes two subgroups, in

which the splitting LLs are characterized by two diﬀerent localization centers of 1/6 and

2/6 unit cell (4/6 and 5/6 unit cell). The dominating sublattice, in determining quantum

numbers, remains unchanged for each subgroup, i.e., two inversely symmetric sublattices

for two split subgroups. As more inter-LL channels are excited, the absorption spectrum

shows double peaks, identiﬁed as α and β types for the inter-LL transitions from the

former and the latter subgroups, respectively (blue and purple curves in Fig. 18(c)). At a
moderate electric ﬁeld Vg ∼ 0.01 eV, coexistence of the twin- and double-peak structures

are displayed, as shown in Fig. 3 of [343]. However, with a further increment of Vg, a lot of

prominent twin-peak absorption peaks gradually change into double-peak ones, a transition

being attributed to the spatial symmetry breaking of the subenvelope functions. In other

words, the two peaks in a double-peak structure are ascribed by the inter-LL transitions

from the distinct centers of 2/6 and 4/6.

The α- and β-type absorption peaks display dramatic changes because of the breaking

of the stacking symmetry that causes sharp contrast of the amplitudes and phases between

their non-equivalent subenvelope functions (detailed discussions in [343]). Specially, the

threshold peak transforms from single-peak to double-peak structure, owing to the Fermi-

Dirac distribution and the generalized selection rule (chapter 2). The electric ﬁeld also

induces intragroup LL anticrossings and thus extra double peaks that exhibit abnormal

electric-ﬁeld-dependent absorption frequencies. However, such peaks can be suppressed or

enhanced by varying the electric ﬁeld strength. It should be noticed that the peak intensity

83

is determined by the weight of the side mode in the progressive LL. The aforementioned

optical characteristics can be veriﬁed by optical spectroscopy.

The electric-ﬁeld-dependent low-frequency absorption spectrum of ABC-stacked trilayer

graphene has been observed from samples on SiO2/Si substrates [343]. The results pro-

vide spectroscopic evidence of gap opening and the blue (or red) shift of low-frequency

absorption peaks at diﬀerent gate voltages. The measured gap is compatible to that from

transport and STM measurements [148] and consistent with the theoretical calculations

based on the tight-binding model over a wide energy range. While the sequence of the ﬁrst

group of LLs was conﬁrmed by the Hall transport measurements, the further experimental

evidence on the magneto-optical spectrum is needed for verifying the inter-LL excitations

in ABC-stacked graphene, which display diﬀerent characteristics than the massless and

massive Dirac fermions in terms of the intensity, number, frequency and selection rule of

the spectral peaks. Also, the features due to the electric-ﬁeld induced symmetry breaking

that have not yet been observed deserve further experimental examination. The optical

spectrum over a wide frequency range can be used to verify the total of nine categories

consisting of single and twin peaks, i.e., three intragroup and six intergroup categories.

The peak intensities are diﬀerent, and in general, the intragroup ones are higher than the

intergroup ones. It should be noticed that as a result of the LL anticrossing, the extra peaks

exhibit a small range of non-continuous intensities and frequencies during the variation of

the magnetic ﬁeld, in which the strongest intensity and blue and red shifts occur at the

anticrossing point. At a suﬃciently low magnetic ﬁelds, lots of peaks with non-monotonic

frequencies reﬂect the magnetic quantization of the sombrero-shaped subbands, and the

ﬁrst threshold single channel can be used to determine the vertical next-nearest interlayer

84

atomic interaction β2.

6 AAB-stacked graphene

The AAB stacking, the second trilayer stacking characteristic, is one of the important

stacking conﬁgurations. This system has been successfully synthesized by experimental

methods such as exfoliation of highly orientated pyrolytic graphite [232, 233] and chemical

and electrochemical reduction of graphene oxide [234]. To date, only a few theoretical

studies are mainly focused on the low-energy electronic [235] and optical properties [236].

Nine interlayer hopping integrals are required to characterize the unique band structure

(Chap. 6.1). This clearly illustrates that stacking conﬁgurations dominate interlayer atomic

interactions and thus essential physical properties.

The electronic structure consists of three pairs of valence and conduction bands corre-

sponding to, oscillatory, sombrero-shaped, and parabolic ones. As to the oscillatory pair,

each subband has three circular constant-energy contours in the energy-wave-vector space.

It is ﬁrst revealed in the AAB stacking, implying that it is exclusive among the trilayer sys-

tems. Similar characteristic for the sombrero-shaped one with two constant-energy loops.

The unusual energy dispersions will induce the complex magnetic quantization because of

the multi-constant-energy loops. This will be reﬂected in the extraordinary features of the

magneto-optical spectra. Without the external ﬁelds, any excitation channels between the

valence and conduction bands are available; furthermore, the asymmetric and symmet-

ric peaks are, respectively, shown in the low- and middle-frequency absorption spectrum.

The magneto-absorption spectra are largely enriched by three intragroup and six intergroup

inter-LL optical excitations. The special relations in phases and amplitudes of LL wavefunc-

tions result in signiﬁcant diﬀerence in intensities between intra- and inter-group transition

peaks. The absorption spectra exhibit the single- or twin-peak structures determined by the

86

quantum modes, LL energy spectra and Fermion distribution. Moreover, the splitting LLs

arising from the destruction of inversion symmetry can diversify the magneto-absorption

spectra. These characteristics are absent in the other stacking systems. In general, the

excitations related to the LLs with well-behaved wavefunctions satisfy the general optical

selection rule. Nevertheless, many extra single peaks are caused by suﬃciently strong side

modes during the LL anti-crossings. The important diﬀerences among four typical stacking

trilayer graphenes mostly lie in the number of excitation categories and the main features

of absorption peaks.

6.1

Electronic and optical properties without external ﬁelds

For the AAB stacking, the ﬁrst two layers are arranged as the AA-stacked conﬁguration

while the third one is the shift of the ﬁrst (or the second) layer by a distance of b along the

armchair direction. The zero-ﬁeld Hamiltonian built from the six tight-binding functions

of the 2pz orbitals is dominated by the intralayer and the interlayer atomic interactions

(cid:48)
is. In order to simulate the unusual energy dispersions, the 10 atomic hopping integrals
γ
are used in the calculations (Fig. 1(c)). γ0 = −2.569 eV represents the nearest-neighbor
intralayer atomic interaction, (γ1 = −0.263 eV, γ2 = 0.032 eV) are related to the interlayer
atomic interactions between the ﬁrst and second layers; (γ3 = −0.413 eV, γ4 = −0.177
eV, γ5 = −0.119 eV) denote those between the second and third layers, (γ6 = −0.013 eV,
γ7 = −0.0177 eV, and γ8 = −0.0119 eV) corresponds to those between the ﬁrst and third
layers, and γ9 = −0.012 eV accounts for the diﬀerence in the chemical environment of A

and B atoms. Only γ1, γ3, and γ6 belong to the vertical interlayer atomic interactions.

The AAB stacking possesses a unique electronic structure, in which three pairs of con-

87

duction and valence bands have special energy dispersions (Fig. 19(a)). The occupied

valence bands are somewhat asymmetric to the unoccupied conduction ones about EF = 0

because of the interlayer atomic interactions. In the vicinity of EF , the ﬁrst pair of sub-

bands Sc,v
exhibit strong oscillatory energy dispersions. The conduction and valence states
1
start from the extreme points of about ±4 meV at the K point. Along the KM or the
KΓ direction, they reach the second ones of ∼ ± 58 meV, further exhibit the oscillatory
variations at the third ones with ∼ ± 4 meV, and then change monotonously. There ex-
ist three constant-energy contours within ± 58 meV and a narrow energy gap of Eg ∼ 8

meV, being absent in other stacking conﬁgurations. The circular loop closest to the K

point has a vanishing radius at the band-edge states so that it does not contribute any

special structure in DOS. This is similar to that in a Dirac-cone structure. Speciﬁcally,

the other two circular loops could be regarded as the 1D energy bands near the band-edge

states; that is, they can display the square-root asymmetric peaks in DOS and spectral

structures. These will induce very complicated LL energy spectra so that the low-energy

expansion of the eﬀective-mass approximation is impossible and can not deal with the

magnetic quantization. Concerning the sombrero-shaped bands Sc,v

2 , the energy diﬀerence

between the two extreme points is quite narrow, only about 5 meV. Away from EF , the
3 possess the band-edge states at about ±0.49 eV. The spe-

monotonic parabolic bands Sc,v

ciﬁc electronic structures distinguish the AAB stacking from the other ones. Moreover, the

generalized tight-binding model is consistent with the ﬁrst-principle calculations in energy

dispersions (dashed curves).

trilayer graphene.

89

The unique energy dispersions can enrich optical properties. There are nine kinds

of excitation channels between any valence and conduction bands, in which the plentiful

structures are revealed in absorption spectrum (Fig. 19(b)). At lower frequency, the two
asymmetric peak structures appear at ω ≈ 0.01 eV and 0.11 eV. This is mainly owing to

the fact that each oscillatory subband has three circular constant-energy loops in energy-

wave-vector space which are related to concave and convex dispersions near the band-edge

states, respectively (Fig. 20). The optical threshold frequency is determined by the narrow

energy gap. The latter corresponds to the oscillation bandwidth of the ﬁrst pair of energy

subbands near the K point. A very predominant sharp peak, which arises from the band-
1), displays at ω ≈ 0.32 eV. Its strong

edge states of energy subbands (Sv

2) & (Sv

2 , Sc

1 , Sc

intensity is due to the very high DOS associated with three valleys in each oscillatory
subband. As to the weak peak at ω ≈ 0.525 eV, it is contributed by the merged excitation

channels of (Sv

2, Sv

3 → Sc

3, Sv

2 → Sc

the optical transitions of Sv
2 in the asymmetric band structures further
leads to two distinguishable peaks at ω ≈ 0.67 eV and 0.79 eV, respectively. Especially,

3 and Sv

1). Moreover, the frequency diﬀerence between
3 → Sc

the excitations of Sv

3 → Sc

3 do not exhibit the special structure because of the extremely

small velocity matrix elements. For the middle frequencies, there are many predominant

peaks due to the saddle points. The absorption spectrum of the AAB stacking presents

more spectral structures at the low- and middle-frequency absorption spectrum compared

with those of the other stackings. The nine interlayer atomic interactions can account for

the conﬁguration-created spectral structures.

The destruction of the inversion symmetry in AAB stacking leads to certain important

diﬀerences between the LL wavefunctions localized at 2/6 (5/6) and 4/6(1/6) centers in

terms of LL energy spacings, quantum numbers, spatial distributions, and anti-crossings.

At 2/6 center, three groups of unoccupied conduction and occupied valence LLs are initiated

93

at 0 (0), -0.23 (0.24) and -0.58 (0.55) eV (Fig. 21). All the LL wavefunctions are almost

well-behaved in the spatial distributions where the main modes are much stronger than

the side ones. Their quantum numbers are, respectively, determined by the A1, B2 and A2

sublattices with the dominating subenvelope functions. For the ﬁrst group, the ordering

of quantum number is monolayer-like, in which the middle nc,v

1 = 0 one is located right at

EF . Dissimilarly, nc,v

2 begins from nc,v

2 = 3, and so on. As

2 = 1, then nc,v

2 = 0, nc,v

2 = 2, nc,v

for nc,v

3 , it normally increases from zero for the higher conduction states, and the deeper

valence states. On the other hand, at 1/6 center, the quantum numbers of the ﬁrst LL

group could be determined by B3 sublattice while those of the other groups are based on

the same sublattices as at 2/6 center. However, the quantum numbers of the low-lying LLs

are not easy to identify from the non-well-behaved spatial distributions, since the complex

LL anti-crossings cause the subenvelope functions to oscillate abnormally. Remarkably, the

quantum numbers are out of normal ordering, diﬀerent to those of monolayer graphene.

The LL splitting in AAB stacking is expected to diversify the magneto-absorption spectra.

94

Figure 21: The magneto-absorption spectrum of AAB-stacked trilayer graphene localized

at 2/6 center with three intragroup and six intergroup categories of LL excitations under

B0 = 40 T. The blue, green, and red color numbers, respectively, indicate the excitations

from the ﬁrst, second, and third LL groups.

95

The AAB stacking conﬁguration induces the special relationships between diﬀerent

subenvelope functions in amplitudes and phases. The amplitudes of the six subenvelope

functions, which depdend on the interlayer atomic interactions, are non-equivalent. Explic-

itly, at 2/6 center, the amplitude of A3 sublattice is much weaker than those of the others

in the ﬁrst LL group (Fig. 21). Similar results are also revealed for A2 and B2 sublattices in

the second group; B3 sublattice of the low-lying LLs in the third group. Moreover, the A1

and A2 (B1 and B2) sublattices have similar subenvelope functions with the same number

of zero points, mainly owing to the same (x,y) projections. Concerning the phases in the

ﬁrst and second LL groups, those of the A1 and A2 sublattices are identical for all the

conduction states but have the distinct signs for the valence ones in the ﬁrst and second

LL groups. The opposite is true for the third LL group. These phase relationships can

also be observed for the B1 and B2 sublattices in the ﬁrst and third groups but opposite

in the second group. The unique features of the subenvelope functions can greatly enrich

the absorption spectra.

97

Three intragroup and six intergroup optical excitations are clearly revealed in the spec-

tra as indicated in Fig. 22. They are in sharp contrast with each other in the peak

structures, spectral intensities, and energy spacings in twin peaks. The peak structures

are determined by the quantum modes, LL energy spectra and Fermion distribution. In

general, the intragroup excitations present very weak twin peaks. On the contrary, the

intergroup absorption peaks are single peaks with monolayer-like strong intensities. Ex-

ceptionally, the transitions between the ﬁrst and third LL groups exhibit twin peaks in

which one peak is very weak while another is rather strong. Regarding the intensities of

absorption peaks, the intergroup optical excitations are much stronger than the intragroup

ones. The amplitude and phase relationship between the Al (Bl) subenvelope function of

spectral intensities. For example, the intragroup peak ω1v2c

the initial state and the Bl (Al) one of the ﬁnal state is responsible for the diﬀerences in
at ω ≈ 0.06 eV (blue arrow
at ω ≈ 0.25 eV (green arrow). For the

in Fig. 22) is about 1/15 the intergroup one ω1v1c
former, the |B1(cid:105) of the nv
1 = 2 ﬁnal state have the
opposite phases, while |B2(cid:105) and (cid:104)A2| possess the same phases. The distinct signs in (cid:104)A1|B1(cid:105)
and (cid:104)A2|B2(cid:105) greatly reduce the velocity matrix elements and thus the peak intensity. On

1 = 1 initial state and the (cid:104)A1| of the nc

1

21

the other hand, strong peak intensity in the latter reﬂects the fact that all the dominating

subenvelope functions of the nv

2 = 1 initial and nc

1 = 1 ﬁnal states on the sublattices, (B1,

A1), (B2, A2); (A3, B3), have the similar phase relationships.

At 2/6 center, the intragroup inter-LL excitations possess a lot of low-intensity ab-

sorption peaks which mostly belong to the twin-peak structure. Exclusively, the threshold
(ω ≈ 0.01 eV) is a single peak with ignorable intensity due to the extremely

peak of ω0v1c

1

weak subenvelope functions of nv

1 = 0 LL in the B1, A2 and A3 sublattices. Distinctively,

98

the threshold peaks of (ω0v1c

2

, ω1v0c

2

) and (ω0v1c

3

, ω1v0c

3

) are twin peaks in which the former

are relatively strong while the latter are comparable with the other intragroup excitation

peaks. This is because all the subenvelope functions of the nv

2 = 0 (1) initial and nc

2 = 1

(0) ﬁnal states on the Al and Bl sublattices have the same (opposite) phases. In general,

three categories of intragroup inter-LL excitations exhibit similar characteristics, including

peak intensity, twin-peak structure, and selection rule (∆n = 1).

For the intergroup inter-LL excitations, beside the asymmetry of LL energy spectra,

the quantum modes are responsible for the peak structures. Speciﬁcally, the absorption

peaks associated with the second LL group are single ones. Concerning the nv
2 → nc
nv

1 transitions, the initial and ﬁnal states of available excitations satisfy nc,v

1 → nc

2 &

1 = nv,c
2 .

Remarkably, the threshold peak of ω0v0c

1,2 and ω0v0c

2,1 are merged together at ω = 0.265 eV

and become a higher-intensity single one. As to the nv
3 and nv
the single peaks mainly come from the inter-LL transitions with |nc,v

2 → nc

3 → nc
2 − nv,c

2 excitations,
3 | = 2 and 0, in

which the former are much higher than the latter as a result of the special phase relations

between the subenvelop functions. On the other hand, the nv
transitions satisfy the selection rule of |nc,v

3 inter-LL
3 | = 1, identical to that of the intragroup

1 − nv,c

1 and nv

3 → nc

1 → nc

ones. Their absorption spectra present the twin-peak structures except that the threshold

peak of ω0v1c
3,1

is a single form, since the ω1v0c
3,1

transition is forbidden by the Fermi-Dirac

distribution function. The intensities of twin peaks quite diﬀer from each other. One of

them is comparable to the intergroup peaks, while another is similar to the intragroup ones.

The splitting of LLs results in critical diﬀerences between 4/6- (Fig. 22) and 2/6-center

magneto-absorption spectra in terms of intensity, frequency, and structure of peaks. These

arise from the abnormal ordering of quantum number and the signiﬁcant side modes during

99

the low-lying LL anti-crossings. The threshold peak ω0v1c
associated with the 4/6 center
is quite prominent at ω ≈ 0.15 eV. There are a lot of low-frequency single peaks when the

1

magnetic ﬁeld corresponds to the range of LL anti-crossings [?]. For example, the nc,v

1 = 0

LL also has the non-negligible side mode of three zero points, being responsible for the

anti-crossing of the nc,v

1 = 0 and nc,v

1 = 3 LLs and the appearance of the single peaks

ω0v2c

1

and ω0v4c

1

. Furthermore, many pairs of LLs in the anti-crossings such as (nc,v

1 = 1,

1 = 4), (nc,v
nc,v

1 = 2, nc,v

1 = 5), and so on, present several extra single peaks. Consequently,

similar characteristics also occur in the initial absorption peaks of the intergroup transitions

between the ﬁrst LL group and others. Diﬀerent from the absorption spectrum at 2/6

2 → nc

3 → nc

center, the nv
|nc,v
2 − nv,c

2 excitations only survive for the inter-LL transitions with
3 | = 0. In short, the LL anti-crossings play an important role in distinguishing

3 and nv

the magneto-absorption spectra due to the splitting LLs.

6.3

Electric ﬁeld enriched optical properties

The electronic structure of AAB stacking is drastically altered in the presence of E.

The Coulomb potential diﬀerence between graphene layers has a strong eﬀect on band gap

as illustrated in Fig. 23(b). As to the oscillatory and sombrero-shaped energy bands, their

oscillation widths are greatly widened. The band-edge states are getting away from the K

point. This induces the larger constant-energy loops, indicating the higher DOS. The energy

spacings of concave and convex energy dispersions become large. The parabolic subbands

might change into linear ones when the electric ﬁeld is suﬃciently large. Remarkably,

the asymmetry between the valence and conduction subbands is largely ampliﬁed by the

close cooperation relationship of the complex interlayer atomic interactions and the electric

100

ﬁeld. Furthermore, their constant-energy loops (or the band-edge states) correspond to the

diﬀerent wave vectors.

The frequency, intensity and number of spectral structures are very sensitive to the

changes in electric-ﬁeld strength, as shown in Fig. 23(c). With the increase of E0, the
optical gap grows monotonously, and then reach a saturated value at higher ﬁelds (E0 ≥ 0.3

eV/layer; blue and green curves). The intensity of the threshold peak is greatly enhanced,

a result of the E0-enlarged constant-energy loops. The similar result is also revealed in

the second peak. There exists an extra weaker peak between these two prominent ones,

reﬂecting the distinct band-edge states in the valence and conduction bands. Moreover,

the original merged absorption peaks might be clearly separated, such as the splitting from

one peak into two ones related to Sv

1 → Sc

2 & Sv

2 → Sc

1. This is caused by the E0-enhanced

asymmetric energy spectrum.

The double degeneracy of LLs in AAB stacking keeps the same even under an electric

ﬁeld, i.e., the doubly-degenerate LLs are characterized by the 2/6 and 1/6 localization

centers in a composite ﬁeld. However, the electric ﬁeld can amplify the asymmetry of LL

energy spectra, alter the spatial distributions in distinct sublattices and generate more fre-

quent anti-crossings, leading to the drastic changes in the frequency, intensity and number

of magneto-absorption peaks. There are more observable symmetric peaks as a result of

the non-merged inter-LL excitation channels and the side-mode-induced ones, as shown in

Fig. 23(c) at E0 = 0.1 eV/layer and B0 = 40 T for the 2/6 case.

101

Figure 23: The E0-enriched (a) band structure, (b) absorption and (c) magneto-absorption

spectra of AAB-stacked trilayer graphene.

102

The electronic and optical properties of the AAB stacking are easily modulated by the

external ﬁelds. The experimental observations on them are absent up to now. The unique

E0-dependence of the band-edge state energies could be directly veriﬁed through the STS [5]

and ARPES measurements [32]. STS is useful in examining the B0-dependent splitting LL

energy spectra with the strong asymmetry about EF , the frequent intra- and inter-group

anti-crossings, and the complex E0-dependence. Moreover, many spectral structures at low

and middle frequency, the magneto-absorption peaks with distinct structures, the diverse

selection rules, and the E0-enriched optical spectra need further examinations using various

optical spectroscopies [32].

6.4 Comparisons among the diﬀerent trilayer stackings

The stacking conﬁgurations can diversify energy dispersions and the optical properties of

trilayer graphenes. As for the low-lying band structure, there are critical diﬀerences among

four stacking conﬁgurations. The AAA- and ABA-stacked trilayer graphenes possess special

band structures with three pairs of linear bands, and a pair of linear bands and two pairs of

parabolic bands, respectively. Their electronic structures can be, respectively, regarded as

the superposition of monolayer graphene, and monolayer and bilayer graphenes. In contrast,

the ABC and AAB stackings exhibit unique energy bands, being absent in monolayer and

bilayer systems. The former has pairs of the partially ﬂat, sombrero-shaped and linear

bands, and the latter possesses pairs of the oscillatory, sombrero-shaped, and parabolic

ones. Remarkably, only the AAB stacking is a narrow direct-gap semiconductor, while the

others are gapless 2D semimetals.

The diverse energy dispersions are directly reﬂected in the rich optical spectrum. For

103

the AAA and ABA stackings, only the intra-Dirac-cone optical excitations can survive as

a result of the linearly symmetric or anti-symmetric superposition of the wavefunctions

in diﬀerent layers. There is solely a shoulder structure in the low-frequency absorption

spectra. As to the former, it is displayed right after a forbidden excitation region under

the speciﬁc fermion distributions due to the almost symmetric upper and lower Dirac

cones. However, that of the latter comes from the distinct parabolic bands. In the middle-

frequency spectrum, these two systems, respectively, present three and ﬁve π-electronic

absorption peaks coming from the saddle points of three pairs of subbands. Regarding

the ABC and AAB stackings, excitation channels between any valence and conduction

bands are available. The threshold frequency of the former is zero while that of the latter

is determined by the narrow energy gap. The low-frequency spectra exhibit peak and

shoulder structures, being diﬀerent from the above-mentioned two stacking systems. The

AAB stacking presents the most plentiful spectral structures due to the complex interlayer

atomic interactions. Under an electric ﬁeld, the spectral characteristics of the AAA stacking
remain similar, but the opposite is true for the other ones. The ABA stacking has the 3× 3

excitation channels, as observed in the ABC and AAB ones. More special absorption

structures are created in these three systems; furthermore, an optical gap is opened for the

ABC stacking.

The magneto-absorption spectra are greatly enriched by stacking conﬁgurations. The

AAA, ABA, ABC and AAB stackings sharply contrast with one another in the excitation

category, structure, intensity, and number of absorption peaks. This is mainly determined

by the special relationships among the subenvelope functions on the six sublattices, the

Fermi-Dirac distribution, the symmetric or asymmetric LL energy spectra, and the LL

104

anti-crossings. The AAA and ABA stackings, only present, respectively, three and ﬁve

categories of absorption peaks. The linearly symmetric and anti-symmetric superposition

of LL wavefunctions in diﬀerent layers can account for the absence of inter-group excitations

related to the Dirac-cone LLs. On the other hand, the ABC- and AAB-stacked trilayer

graphenes possess nine categories of absorption peaks. Regarding the spectral form and

intensity, the intra-Dirac-cone LL excitations in the AAA and ABA stackings are mainly

present in the single peaks with a predominantly uniform intensity, owing to the almost

symmetric LL spectra and same velocity matrix elements. Speciﬁcally, the ABA stacking

also has the bilayer-like magneto-absorption spectrum in the twin-peak structure. The

ABC stacking exhibits the twin-peak structures except for the initial absorption peaks. In

general, the intragroup excitations are stronger than the intergroup ones which is in sharp

contrast with the AAB stacking. The AAB stacking displays more complex magneto-

absorption spectra with many single and twin peaks, reﬂecting the complex relationship

between the interlayer atomic interactions and the magnetic quantization. The intensity

diﬀerence between the intra- and inter-group excitation peaks is more obvious. Especially,

the LL anti-crossings and the splitting LLs at diﬀerent localization centers signiﬁcantly

increase the number of absorption peaks. The critical diﬀerences among the four stacking

systems can provide the useful information in identifying the speciﬁc stacking conﬁgurations

by the experimental measurements [32].

The magneto-absorption spectra can be diversiﬁed by an electric ﬁeld, depending on

the stacking conﬁgurations. The main features of optical properties in AAA stacking are

hardly changed under a composite external ﬁeld while those of the other three are greatly

enriched. The obvious changes of magneto-absorption peaks lie in frequency and intensity.

105

In the ABA and ABC stackings, extra peaks and double peaks are generated, respectively,

by the LL anti-crossings and splitting LLs. Especially, the former displays more inter-LL

excitation categories which is absent in the other stacking systems.

Sliding bilayer graphene

In addition to the high-symmetry stackings, the low-symmetry ones deserve systematic

researches [237–242, 244–250, 288]. A sliding bilayer graphene (BLG), with various mis-

alignment conﬁgurations, is chosen for the detailed discussions about the speciﬁc essential

properties. During the shift between two graphene layers, the ﬁrst-principle calculations

show that the variation of the total ground state energy is small among the conﬁguration-

dependent BLGs [251]. Moreover, some recent experimental studies have successfully syn-

thesized asymmetric stackings using speciﬁc techniques [252]. Stacking boundaries in which

one of the graphene layer is shifted with respect to another one are successfully grown using

the CVD method [253]. The sliding of graphene ﬂakes on a graphene substrate can also

be initiated by the STM tip to overcome the weak van der Waals interactions [252]. In

addition, micrometer-size graphite ﬂakes can slide spontaneously after stirred by a STM

tip [254, 255].

The generalized tight-binding model is suitable for studying the magnetic quantization

in the high- and low-symmetry BGLs. The variation in stacking conﬁguration can induce

a dramatic transformation between the Dirac-cone structure and the parabolic band struc-

ture [251, 256–259], and thus create unusual absorption spectra in terms of optical gap

and low- and middle-frequency special structures. The low-frequency optical properties

are signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by an electric ﬁeld. The low-frequency optical properties are

signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by an electric ﬁeld. Moreover, the LLs of a sliding BLG exhibit the

drastic changes in the spatial symmetry, initial formation energy, intergroup anti-crossings,

state degeneracy and semiconductor-metal transition. There are three kinds of LLs: the

well-behaved, perturbed and undeﬁned LLs, being characterized by a speciﬁc mode, a main

107

mode plus side modes, and a disordered mode, respectively. Such LLs are clearly revealed

in diverse magneto-optical selection rules. Specially, the undeﬁned LLs frequently present

intergroup anti-crossings in the B0-dependent energy spectra, and exhibit a large number

of absorption peaks in the absence of selection rule. The diverse selection rules, the spe-

cial B0-dependent energy spectra, and the unusual zero-ﬁeld absorption spectra are closely

related to stacking conﬁgurations; therefore, the experimental measurements on them can

be used to resolve the subangstrom misalignment stackings of BLG.

7.1

Electronic and optical properties without external ﬁelds

The distinct stacking conﬁgurations of BLG can be tuned by the relative shift between
two layers. When a shift happens along the armchair direction in the range of 0 ≤ δ ≤12b/8,
stacking conﬁgurations alter among the high-symmetry ones: AA (δ = 0) −→AB (δ =b)
−→ AA(cid:48) (δ =1.5b) (Fig. 24). The C atoms in the AA(cid:48) stacking have the distinct x-

y projections, while they experience the same chemical envirnment, as observed in the

AA stacking. Four carbon atoms are included in a primitive unit cell. For all the stacking

conﬁgurations [251,260,261], the low-energy electronic properties are dominated by the 2pz

orbitals, as being indicated by the agreement between the tight-binding model and the ﬁrst-

principle calculations. There exist the complicated interlayer atomic interactions during

the variation of shift. The position-dependent empirical formula is chosen to characterize

the intra- and inter-layer atomic interactions:

− γij = γ0e

− d−b

 [1 − (

d · ˆz
d

)2] + γ1e

− d−d0
 (

d · ˆz
d

)2

(31)

108

γij is the atomic interaction between lattice sites i and j, depending on the distance and
the angle of two 2pz orbitals. γ0= −2.7 eV is the nearest-neighbor hopping integral in

the same layer, γ1= 0.48 eV the interlayer vertical hopping integral, d the position vector

connecting two lattice points, d0=3.35 ˚A the interlayer distance, and =0.184b the decay

length. Equation (31) has been acceptable to describe the interlayer atomic interactions in

carbon-related systems, e.g., multi-walled carbon nanotubes [260, 261].

109

chair direction.

The sliding BLG exhibits the dramatic changes in band structures. The diﬀerent stack-

ing systems possess the overlap of valance and conduction bands (Figs. 25(a)-25(f)); that

is, they are semi-metallic systems with a low free carrier density. The space-inversion sym-

metry keeps the same in the presence of shift so that each valley in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone

is identical [262]. The K valley is suﬃcient for a model study. With a small shift (δ=

b/8 in Fig. 25(b)), two pairs of isotropic Dirac cones in the AA stacking (Fig. 25(a)) are

changed into the distorted energy dispersions. An eye-shaped stateless region is created
near the Fermi level. Band structure is symmetric about the kx-axis, since the y−→−y

and space-inversion symmetries are unbroken. A pair of band contact points remain as

the Fermi-momentum states. The Dirac-cone structures gradually become smoother in the

further increase of δ. After the serious distortion, the Dirac points are fully separated near

δ ∼= 6b/8 (Fig. 25(c)).

111

Figure 25: The low-energy band structures near the K point for various stacking conﬁgu-

rations: (a) δ=0, (b) b/8, (c) 6b/8, (d) b, (e) 11b/ 8; (f) 12b/8.

112

A further shift in the range of b ≤ δ ≤ 1.5b also leads to the special transformation

of energy dispersions. Two pairs of parabolic bands are formed in the AB stacking of

δ =b (Fig. 25(d)), as veriﬁed by ARPES [263, 264]. The ﬁrst pair of parabolic energy
dispersion nearest to EF is seriously distorted along ±ˆky directions, as shown for δ =11b/8

in Fig. 25(e). An eye-shaped stateless region is created with two distinct Dirac points

at diﬀerent energies; furthermore, two neighboring conduction (valance) bands have strong

hybridization. Finally, such energy bands are transformed into two pairs of isotropic Dirac-

cone structures at δ =1.5b (Fig. 25(f)). Specially, two Dirac cones are slightly tilted,

and the Dirac points are deviated from the K point (Fig. 26) [257]. The AA(cid:48) and AA

stackings, respectively, possess the non-vertical and vertical Dirac-cone structures. This

will induce the critical diﬀerences in magnetic quantization and magnetic-optical properties.

The above-mentioned dramatic transformation of energy bands is also conﬁrmed by the

ﬁrst-principle calculations [251].

structures.

115

The two-dimensional electronic structures, as shown in Figs. 27(a)-27(f) which are

depicted along high symmetry points, can also provide the useful information on the elec-

tronic properties. The low-lying isotropic energy dispersions near EF are transformed

between isotropic and anisotropic characteristics (insets). The AA stacking presents the

linear isotropic dispersions near the K point (Fig. 27(a)). During the variation of shift,

they change into the anisotropic distorted ones at δ = b/8 & 6b/8 (Figs. 27(b) & 27(c))

and become the parabolic isotropic ones at δ = b (Fig. 27(d)). And then, energy disper-
sions are anisotropic in the range of b ≤ δ ≤ 1.5b (Figs. 27(e) and 27(f)). Except for the

AA and AB stackings, other systems present the distorted energy dispersions and highly

anisotropic 2D band structures. Regardless of the semi-metallic property of the sliding
BLG, tiny energy spacings might exist along K → M and K → M(cid:48) (Figs. 27(b) and 27(c)).
Concerning the middle-energy electronic states, the M and M(cid:48) points remain as the saddle

points in the energy-wave-vector space; that is, they will make much contribution to DOS

and absorption spectrum. Their energies become split except for the AA and AB stackings.
The 3-fold rotation symmetry is destroyed, while the space and y → −y inversion symme-

tries are invariant. This accounts for the distinct energies between the two M points and

the four M(cid:48) points in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone (Fig. 24). The splitting energy is observable
with a wide range of ≈ 0.1−0.6 eV, when the sliding BLG signiﬁcantly deviates from the

AA or AB stacking.

Up to now, ARPES measurements have conﬁrmed two vertical Dirac cones of the AA

stacking and two pairs of parabolic bands of the AB stacking [263, 264]. The feature-

rich electronic properties of conﬁguration-dependent BLGs, including the transformation

between Dirac-cone structures and parabolic bands, the tilted Dirac cones, the stateless arc-

116

shaped region, the distorted energy dispersions, and the spitting of middle-energy states,

can be further veriﬁed with ARPES [263–266]. This is one way to identify the tiny misalign-

ment stackings related to various BLG conﬁgurations, as suggested by the experimental

examinations on the predicted phonon spectra [267].

117

12b/8. Insets show low-frequency ones.

118

The unusual electronic structues can diversify the absorption spectra. The AA stacking

reveals a forbidden excitation zone before the threshold frequency, since the spatial wave-

function symmetries lead to the zero velocity matrix elements for the inter-Dirac-cone

excitations. Two shoulders are presented in absorption spectra, as indicated in Fig. 28(a).

Their frequencies of 0.64 & 0.73 eV’s are, respectively, proportional to the Fermi velocities

of the upper and lower Dirac cones; therefore, the optical measurements on the initial

absorption structures could be used to identify the Dirac-cone Fermi velocity. The optical

gap vanishes in a small shift (δ = b/8 in Fig. 28(b)), being replaced by a prominent peak
at ∼ 0.1 eV and a forbidden region with a width of ∼0.4 eV. Such features are associated

with the saddle points and the vacant arc-shaped region in the distorted energy bands (Fig.

2(b)). Speciﬁcally, the δ =6b/8 stacking exhibits the gapless and featureless absorption

spectrum as a result of the quite diﬀerent wave vectors in the saddle points of valence
and conduction states (Fig. 28(c)). A ∼0.3-eV shoulder structure, which comes from

the band-edge state excitations between the ﬁrst and the second pairs of parabolic bands,

appears in the AB stacking (Fig. 28(d)). This has been veriﬁed by optical measurements on

absorption [268, 269], reﬂection [270, 273, 274], transmission spectra [270, 270] and Raman

scattering [271, 287]. Moreover, an optical gap is recovered in the large-shift BLGs, e.g.,

δ = 11b/8 in Fig. 28(e) and δ = 12b/8 in Fig. 28(f). As for the middle-frequency

optical spectra, the AA, small-δ and AB stackings (Figs. 28(a), 28(b); 28(d)), have two

very strong absorption peaks, while the other stackings present four or three ones (Figs.

28(c), 28(e); 28(f)). This directly reﬂects the existence or destruction of the three-fold

rotation symmetry. Obviously, the experimental measurements [271, 275, 276, 287] on the

low- and middle-frequency absorption structures are an eﬃcient method to identify the

119

various stacking conﬁgurations in the sliding BLG.

7.2 Magneto-electronic and optical properties

Three types of LLs, the well-behaved, perturbed, and undeﬁned ones, are presented

in the diﬀerent stacking systems. The main characteristics are identiﬁed from the spatial
distributions of wave functions and the B0-dependent energy spectra. Both AA and AA(cid:48)

stackings belong to the ﬁrst type. The ﬁrst and second types could be found in most

stacking systems, such as the AB, ABC and AAB ones, and the sliding BLGs with a

small shift. The quantum numbers in the sliding systems are deﬁned by the B1 sublattice

for the localization center of 2/6. Moreover, the third type is revealed in the speciﬁc

stacking systems corresponding to the dramatic changes of energy bands. In addition, the

degeneracy of LL states remains the same for any shifts.

120

122

(d) b, (e) 11b/ 8; (f) 12b/8.

The LLs of AA and AA(cid:48) stackings exhibit the regular spatial distributions with the sym-

metry or anti-symmetry about the localization centers and the normal zero points. Their

√

energies are proportional to

nc,vB0, as revealed in the B0-dependent energy spectrum (δ

=b in Fig. 30(d)). However, the important diﬀerence between them lies in the localiztion

centers. The AA stacking has a ﬁxed localization center of 2/6 (Fig. 29(a)). As to the

AA(cid:48) stacking, the ﬁrst and second groups of LL wave functions deviate from the 2/6 posi-

tion along opposite directions (nc,v

1 & nc,v

2

in Fig. 29(f)). The main reason is that the ky

component is diﬀerent for the current Dirac points and the K points, and the deviation of

Dirac-cone centers grows with the increasing energy (Fig. 26) [257]. The tilted Dirac-cone

structures can create the new magneto-optical selection rules.

The AB-stacked BLG has a high-symmetry conﬁguration, while its Hamiltonain can

not be exactly diagonalized [277]. The interlayer atomic interactions in the magnetic quan-

tizations could be treated as perturbations. The LL wave functions are presented with the

normal quantum numbers, as shown in Fig. 28(d) at B0= 40 T. But when magnetic ﬁeld is
very high (B0 (cid:38) 60 T; in the inset of Fig. 30(c)), the B0-dependent electronic spectra show

that some perturbed LLs in the anti-crossing regions are related to the distinct groups of

LLs. The second type of LLs is frequently revealed in the sliding BLG with a small shift

measured from the AA, AA(cid:48), and AB stackings, as indicated by the anti-crossings in Fig.

29(a). The low-lying LLs of δ= b/8 exhibit the distorted wave functions composed of the

main and side modes (Fig. 29(b)). Such LLs come from the low-energy distorted electronic

structure (Fig. 25(b)).

123

Figure 30: The B0-dependent LL energy spectra of (a) b/8, (b) 6b/8, (c) b; (d) 12b/8.

With a large shift deviated from the high-symmetry stacking conﬁgurations, the LL

wave functions present the irregular oscillations without the normal zero points, e.g., δ=

6b/8 and 11b/8 in Figs. 29(c) and 29(e), respectively. They can not be deﬁned as a

single-mode oscillator; that is, the main mode is absent for any magnetic-ﬁeld strength.

Moreover, the B0-dependent energy spectrum indicates that each LL in the second group

displays serious anti-crossings with all the LLs in the ﬁrst one, and vice versa (Fig. 30(b));

This clearly illustrates that such LLs consist of various zero-point modes or that they

could be veriﬁed as the undeﬁned LLs. They arise from the fully distorted energy bands

(Fig. 25(c)). The K and K(cid:48) points do not belong to the critical points; therefore, the

low-energy expansion about them is not suitable for the magnetic quantization.

It is

impossible to comprehend the undeﬁned modes from the eﬀective-mass approximation.

124

The above-mentioned three types of LLs have the distinct energy spectra, in which their

main characteristics can be directly examined by the STS measurements [278–281].

125

126

The diverse spatial distributions of three kinds of LLs can enrich the magneto-optical

absorption spectra [257]. Absorption spectra of the sliding BLG are revealed in the twin- or

single-peak structures, depending on the diﬀerence of excitation frequency in the asymmet-

ric LL energies. The well-behaved LLs in the AA and AA(cid:48) stackings exhibit two categories

1→nv

2→nv

1 & nc

of intragroup excitations (nc
2). The absorption peaks of the former satisfy a
speciﬁc selection rule of ∆ n =±1 (Fig. 31(a)), while those of the latter are discribed by ∆n
= ±1, 0, and ±2 (Fig. 31(f)). The new selection rules of ∆ n = 0 & ±2, which correspond

to a lot of observable absorption peaks (blue and green triangles), are associated with the

tilted Dirac-cone structures in the AA(cid:48) stacking. They are mainly determined by the rela-

tions between the initial state on the Al (Bl) sublattice and the ﬁnal state on the Bl (Al)

one. The valence- and conduction-state subenvelop functions have the diﬀerent localization
centers so that the excitation channels of ∆ n= 0 & ±2 gradually become obvious at higher

frequency. Such rules are never predicted to exist in the other condensed-matter systems

with the well-behaved LLs.

On the other hand, four categories of inter-LLs excitations, two intragroup and two

intergroup ones, are revealed in the other stacking systems. The AB stacking, with the
well-behaved LLs at B0 (cid:46) 60 T, exhibits many prominent absorption peaks of ∆ n =±1,

as indicated in Fig. 30(d). Speciﬁcally, the absorption frequencies due to the inter-LL

excitations of the ﬁrst group present the linear B0-dependence (being identiﬁed from Fig.

30(c)). As for the sliding BLGs slightly deviated from the normal stackings, most of the
absorption peaks agree with ∆ n =±1 (δ = b/8 in Fig. 31(b)). However, some peaks have
the extra selection rules of ∆ n =0 & ±2 (blue and green triangles), whose intensities are

dominated by the relative strength of the main and side modes in the perturbed LLs (Fig.

127

29(b)). Specially, the undeﬁned LLs show a large number of absorption peaks without any

optical selection rules. This means that all the occupied LLs could be eﬀectively excited

to any unoccupied ones, i.e., all the inter-LL excitation channels are eﬀective under the

requirement of the Fermi-Dirac distribution.

In general, such peaks are relatively low

for an easy observation, since the velocity matrix elements are signiﬁcantly reduced by

the random spatial distributions of the disordered quantum modes. The above-mentioned

unique magneto-optical properties, the new selection rules, the extra ones, and the absence

of selection rule, are worthy of a detailed examination using the optical spectroscopy [282–

285].

7.3

Electric ﬁeld enriched optical properties

Electronic structures are signiﬁcantly altered by the perpendicular electric ﬁeld, such as

Dirac-cone structures, saddle points, band gaps, and energy dispersions. All the stacking
systems have the y→−y symmetry (& time reversal symmetry); that is, electronic states are
identical in the K and K(cid:48) valleys. Only the AA stacking presents the similar isotropic Dirac-
cone structures [286], since the r→−r and y→−y inversion symmetries remain the same.
But for the AA(cid:48) stacking (Fig. 32(e)), the electric potential diﬀerence between two layers

induces the splitting of Dirac Dirac points (four points) and the seriously distorted Dirac-

cone structure with extra saddle points. Energy gaps are generated in most of the bilayer

stacking systems except for those close to AA and AA(cid:48) ones, as shown in Figs. 32(a) and

32(c) (δ=6b/8 and b). Speciﬁcally, the AB stacking possesses the weakly dispersive energy

bands with a deep pocket near the Fermi level (the slightly distorted sombrero-shaped

bands). The Dirac-cone structures and energy gaps are directly reﬂected in optical gaps.

128

The electric ﬁeld causes each stacking system to exhibit a threshold frequency (Figs. 32(b),

32(d); 32(f)), which is rather diﬀerent from the zero-ﬁeld case. The dependence of optical

gap on the ﬁeld strength is monotonous, i.e., it gradually grows as in Figs. 32(b) & 32(d)

and declines as in Fig. 32(f) in the increasing ﬁeld strength. Moreover, there exist extra

special structures in absorption spectrum. For the δ=6b/8 stacking, an extra absorption
peak appears at a higher frequency (∼0.35 eV), mainly owing to the nearly identical wave

vectors in the valence and conduction saddle points (red arrows). The AB stacking has

two prominent asymmetric peaks, in which the lower- and higher-frequency ones arise from

the optical excitations of the intra- and inter-pair energy bands, respectively. The high

DOS from the ﬁrst pair of energy bands accounts for the strong absorption intensity. The

E-induced saddle points in the AA(cid:48) stacking can create a quite strong peak structure.

Figure 33: Absorption spectra under a composite ﬁeld for bilayer graphenes with (a)

δ=6b/8, (b) b; (c) 12b/8.

131

In the presence of a composite electric and magnetic ﬁeld, the x→−x and y→−y in-
version symmetries are conserved in the AA and AA(cid:48) stackings, while the former is absent

in the other BLG stackings. Upon the condition of the splitting, the magnetic quantiza-

tion of K and K(cid:48) valleys indicates that only these two high-symmetry stackings possess

the four-fold degenerate LLs. The splitting LLs exist in the other BLG’s. Moreover, the

seriously distorted and the weakly dispersive energy dispersions are magnetically quantized

into the multi-mode LLs. There are more perturbed and undeﬁned LLs, so that the LL-

anticorssings occur frequently in the E0- and B0-dependent energy spectra. Apparently, the

destructions in the state degeneracy and the well-behaved mode induce more complicated

magneto-absorption structures, as shown in Figs. 33(a)-33(c). The number of absorption

peaks is largely enhanced. Most of them present the lower intensity except those whose LLs
are associated with the high-DOS energy dispersions (0.2 eV≤ ω ≤ 0.4 eV). The original

magneto-selection rules can survive in a composite ﬁeld.

Optical measurements under external ﬁelds are made only for the AB-stacked BLG

by using the absorption [268, 269], transmission [270], reﬂection [270, 273, 274] and Raman

scattering [?, 287, 288] spectroscopies. They agree with a number of theoretical predictions

including the low-frequency shoulder structure at zero ﬁelds [259, 289–292], the E-induced

threshold frequency and two prominent peaks [268, 269], the magneto-optical selection
rule of ∆ n=±1 for the inter-LL excitations of the ﬁrst group [282], and the linearly B0-

dependent absorption frequency. The other predicted results, which are the forbidden

excitation region induced by the Fermi-Dirac distribution, the E-created optical gaps and

special structures in any bilayer stackings, the diverse selection rules due to three kinds of

LLs, and the drastic changes of the spectral features in a composite ﬁeld, can be further

132

examined by optical spectroscopies.

8 Concluding remarks

A systematic review has been made on optical properties of graphene. The generalized

tight-binding mode and the gradient approximation are used to explore the rich absorption

spectra. They are suitable for studying the low-symmetry stacking conﬁgurations and the

complex external ﬁelds. The rich features due to the stacking conﬁgurations and the ex-

ternal ﬁelds are investigated in detail. The AAA, ABA, ABC and AAB stackings, and the

various stackings in BLG’s are taken into account. The zero-, electric-, magnetic and com-

posite ﬁelds are included in the calculations. The presented results are compared with those

from other theoretical calculations and validated by the experimental measurements, while

most of predictions require further experimental veriﬁcations. The developed theoretical

framework can promote the future studies on other 2D materials.

The high-symmetry AA-stacked trilayer graphene presents three vertical Dirac-Dirac

structures with separated Dirac points. Only the intra-Dirac-cone optical excitations can

survive because of the linearly symmetric or anti-symmetric superposition of the tight-

binding functions in diﬀerent layers. The spectral intensity due to the middle Dirac cone

linearly depends on excitation frequency, as observed in monolayer graphene. In addition,

an even-layer AA stacking possesses an optical gap determined by the ﬁrst shoulder struc-

ture. The almost symmetric upper and lower Dirac cones, with free holes and electrons

respectively, result in a forbidden excitation region under the speciﬁc fermion distributions.

Their Dirac points shift away from the Fermi level in the presence of electric ﬁeld and thus

create the enlarged vacant region or the blue shift of shoulder structure. On the other hand,

three obvious symmetric peaks, which come from the saddle points near the M point, are

revealed in the middle-frequency absorption spectrum. Three groups of the well-behaved

134

LLs only exhibit three categories of intra-group optical excitations, in which each promi-
nent delta-function-like peak is characterized by the ∆n=±1 selection rule. Most spectral

structures belong to single peaks with an almost uniform intensity, reﬂecting the approxi-

mately symmetric LL energy spectrum and the close Fermi velocities. Any peak frequency

√

is characterized by the

B0 dependence. As for the bilayer-like intra-group excitations,

the ﬁrst inter-LL channel changes discontinuously at certain magnetic ﬁelds, so that its

frequency has a discontinuous B0-dependence. Specially, the main features of optical and

electronic properties keep similar in a composite external ﬁeld, a result of the conservation

of spatial symmetries.

The AB-stacked trilayer graphene possesses a slightly separated Dirac-cone structure

and two pairs of parabolic bands, a superposition of monolayer- and bilayer-like energy

bands. The optical excitations are vanishing between the former and the latter. Only

an observable shoulder structure due to the distinct parabolic bands appears in the low-

frequency absorption spectrum, while there exist ﬁve symmetric peaks at middle frequency.

Any excitation channel between valence and conduction bands becomes available for a suf-

ﬁciently high electric ﬁeld. More low-frequency special structures are generated in absorp-

tion spectra, in which the asymmetric peaks are related to the E0-dependent oscillatory

and sombrero-shaped bands with circular constant-energy contours. However, the optical

threshold frequency keeps zero, i.e., the semimetal-semiconductor transition is absent dur-

ing the variation of electric ﬁeld. The similar behavior could also be observed in the AB

stackings of N>3. In general, the LL splitting energies are negligible so that the magneto-

absorption spectra are almost the same for the distinct localization centers. One category

and the other four categories of magneto-optical excitations, which, respectively, come

from monolayer- and bilayer-like LLs, exhibit many single- and twin-peak structures. Such

absorption peaks due to the well-behaved modes obey the speciﬁc selection rules. The

former is much stronger than the latter; furthermore, a simple relationship between the

intensity and absorption frequency is absent for the latter. Especially, the certain initial

excitations associated with the double-degenerate LLs of (nc,v

1 =0; nc,v

2 =0 &1) can survive

and are distinguishable in single-peak absorption frequencies. The magneto-optical spectra

are greatly enriched by the electric ﬁeld because of the splitting LLs and the intra-group

LL anti-crossings. Five categories of inter-LL excitations are changed into nine ones. The

twin peaks and the double peaks can occur simultaneously, reﬂecting the asymmetric and

the splitting LL energy spectra, respectively. Moreover, the frequent anti-crossings of the

perturbed LLs in the E0-dependent energy spectrum lead to the increase of peaks and the

reduced intensities.

The ABC-stacked trilayer graphene has three pairs of unusual energy bands, namely

the partially ﬂat (surface-localized), sombrero-shaped and linear ones. Excitation channels

between any valence and conduction bands are available. The threshold frequency is zero

and the ﬁrst absorption peak corresponds to the band-edge-state excitations between the

surface-localized and sombrero-shaped energy bands. There are four obvious peaks in the

middle-frequency absorption spectrum. Optical gap (energy gap), being characterized by

the threshold peak from the separated surface-localized bands, is created by an electric

ﬁeld. The original peak exhibits an obvious blue shift. Three groups of LLs can generate

nine categories of absorption peaks, including six inter-group and three intra-group ones.

Remarkably, the intergroup LL anti-crossings frequently emerge in the B0-dependent energy

spectrum and thus induce extra absorption peaks. Many of the prominent absorption

136

peaks associated with the well-behaved LLs are presented under the speciﬁc selection rules.

As to these two kinds of absorption peaks, their B0 dependence is rather strong. The

magneto-optical properties are diversiﬁed by an electric ﬁeld. With the increased electric-

ﬁeld strength, many outstanding inter-LL absorption peaks gradually change from the

twin-peak structures into the double-peak ones, as a result of the non-equivalence condition

imposed on the two sublattices with identical projections. In particular, a single threshold

peak becomes a double-peak structure, owing to the Fermi-Dirac distribution. The extra

peaks are generated by the intragroup LL anticrossings, and the abnormal E0-dependent

absorption frequencies are simultaneously revealed.

The AAB-stacked trilayer graphene, without the z-plane mirror symmetry, sharply con-

trasts to the other highly symmetric stacking systems. It is a narrow-gap semiconductor,

while the others are semimetals. Electronic and optical properties are enriched by the

various interlayer atomic interactions. The unique band structure includes the oscillatory,
sombrero-shaped and parabolic energy dispersions. The 3×3 excitation channels present

more special structures in the low- and middle-frequency optical spectrum, compared to

those of the ABC stacking. As for the ﬁrst asymmetric absorption peak, its frequency

is energy gap between the valence and conduction oscillatory bands; furthermore, both

frequency and intensity are signiﬁcantly altered by an electric ﬁeld. The LLs are split by

the broken mirror symmetry, a phenomenon being absent in the other stacking systems.

The intragroup and intergroup anti-crossings occur frequently because of the complex rela-

tionship between the magnetic quantization and the interlayer atomic interactions. There

are nine categories of absorption peaks, in which the inter-group LL excitations are much

higher than the intra-group ones, depending on the phases and amplitudes of LL wavefunc-

137

tions. The magneto-absorption spectra exhibit the single- or twin-peak structures which

are dominated by the quantum modes, LL energy spectra and Fermi-Dirac distribution.

The splitting LLs, with diﬀerent localization centers, can generate very distinct absorption

spectra including extra single peaks during the anticrossings. A lot of strong peaks, which

arise from the well-behaved LLs, can be characterized by the speciﬁc selection rules. The

intensity and frequency of magneto-absorption peaks are strongly aﬀected by an electric

ﬁeld.

Various stacking conﬁgurations can diversify electronic structures and absorption spec-

tra in the sliding BLG. The vertical or non-vertical Dirac cones transform into parabolic

bands, accompanied by the separation of cone structures, creation of an arc-shaped state-

less region, distorted energy dispersions, extra low-energy critical points, and splitting of

middle-energy states. All the stacking systems belong to gapless semimetals, while an op-

tical gap is only present in the AA and AA(cid:48) stackings because of the intra-cone excitations.

The low-frequency shoulders or peaks strongly depend on stacking conﬁguration; further-

more, there are three or four middle-frequency strong peaks in the absence of three-fold

rotation symmetry. An electric ﬁeld causes the semi-metallic BLGs to become semicon-

ductors except for AA and AA(cid:48) ones; therefore, optical gaps are revealed in any absorption

spectra.

It also leads to extra low-frequency peaks related to the seriously distorted or

weakly dispersive energy bands. As for magneto-optical spectra, the diverse selection rules

are dominated by three kinds of LLs with the normal or irregular spatial distributions.

A lot of strong absorption peaks due to the well-behaved LLs obey the speciﬁc selection
rules, such as (∆n=±1; ±1; ±1, 0, ±2) for the AA, AB and AA(cid:48) stackings. Two novel
selection rules, ∆n=0 and ±2, are veriﬁed to arise from the tilted Dirac cones in the AA(cid:48)

138

stacking. The anti-crossing perturbated LLs induce extra selection rules (∆n=0&±2) in

the intergroup optical excitations, but the heights of the absorption peaks are relatively

low. More peculiarly, the undeﬁned LLs create a large number of absorption peaks in the

absence of a speciﬁc selection rule. Magneto-optical spectra in a composite ﬁeld are more

complicated, such as the drastic changes in the number and intensity of absorption peaks.

Up to now, the experimental observations are consistent with part of theoretical calcu-

lations on the optical properties in external ﬁelds. As to the AB-stacked bilayer graphene,
the ∼0.3-eV shoulder structure under zero ﬁeld, the E-induced semimetal-semiconductor

transition and two low-frequency asymmetric peaks, the two strong π-electronic absorption
peaks at middle frequency, the ∆n=±1 selection rule for the ﬁrst group of LLs, and the lin-

ear B0-dependence of the inter-LL excitation energies, have been conﬁrmed by absorption,

transmission, reﬂection, and/or Raman scattering spectroscopies. The similar veriﬁcations
performed on the trilayer ABA stacking contain one shoulder at ∼0.5 eV, the gapless be-

havior unaﬀected by electric ﬁeld, the E-generated low-frequency multi-peak structures,

several π-electronic peaks, and the monolayer- and bilayer-like inter-LL absorption fre-

quencies. Moreover, the identiﬁed spectral features in the ABC-stacked trilayer graphene

cover two low-frequency characteristic peaks and gap opening under electric ﬁeld. On the

other side, a plenty of important predicted results require further experimental examina-

tions, including the shoulders, asymmetric peaks and symmetric ones in zero-ﬁeld optical

spectra, the initial forbidden excitation region in even-layer AA stacking systems, the more

spectral structures in lower-symmetry stacking conﬁgurations, the E-created optical gaps

and special structures, the signiﬁcant dependence of the prominent π-electronic peaks on

stacking conﬁguration and layer number, the diverse magneto-optical selection rules due

139

to three kinds of LLs, the delta-function-like inter-LL absorption peaks with the single,

twin and double forms, the almost uniform single peaks related to the non-tilted Dirac

cones, the LL-antirossing-induced drastic changes in number and intensity of peaks, and

the greatly diversiﬁed magneto-absorption spectra under a composite ﬁeld. The experi-

mental measurements on the frequency and form of spectral structures can provide the

critical information in identifying energy bands and LL energy spectra, such as, the linear,

parabolic, sombrero-shaped and oscillatory dispersions, and the symmetric, asymmetric

and splitting LL energy spectra. They are very useful in understanding the complex rela-

tionship among the stacking conﬁgurations, the magnetic quantization, and the Coulomb

potential energy. Also, they could be used to distinguish the geometric structures of the

distinct stacking domains.

In addition to the stacking conﬁgurations, the diﬀerent dimensionalities can create the

diverse properties of carbon-related systems. The 1D graphene nanoribbons [293–308], 2D

graphenes and 3D graphites [309–323] quite diﬀer from one another in the electronic and

optical properties. Concerning the ﬁrst systems, the ﬁnite-size quantum conﬁnement and

edge structure dominate the essential properties. A lot of asymmetric absorption peaks,

which come from the 1D parabolic energy bands in the absence of external ﬁelds, obey

the armchair- or zigzag-dependent selection rule [302–305]. The spatial distributions of the

standing waves are responsible for this unusual rule, since they are mainly determined by the

distinct boundary structures. When the ribbon width is longer than the magnetic length,

each 1D Landau subband consists of the dispersionless quasi-LL and parabolic dispersion.

The almost well-behaved quasi-LLs are localized at the ribbon center, and they exhibit

prominent symmetric peaks with a selection rule similar to that in monolayer graphene

140

[306]. The edge- and magneto-dependent selection rules will be destroyed by a suﬃciently

high transverse electric ﬁeld [307,308]. On the other side, the periodically interlayer atomic

interactions play a critical role in the 3D graphites. The AA- [309], AB- [310–313] and

ABC-stacked [314] graphites, respectively, have one pair, two pairs and one pair of 3D

valence and conduction bands. Their low-frequency absorption spectra, respectively, show

a shoulder structure after the interband forbidden region, a concave-downward one and a

shoulder one. Speciﬁcally, optical gaps are vanishing in the latter two systems [315, 316].

The 3D magnetically quantized states form the Landau subbands (LSs) composed of 2D

dispersionless LLs and 1D kz-dependent energy dispersions . The number of LS group is,

respectively, one, two and one for the simple hexagonal, Bernal and rhombohedral graphites.
Many LSs in the AA-stacked graphite cross the Fermi level and their bandwidths are ∼1

eV, reﬂecting the strongest interlayer atomic interactions among three systems. Such LSs

generate a plenty of twin structures of opposite-direction asymmetric peaks [317,318]. The
LSs of the AB-stacked graphite possess ∼0.2-eV band widths, and only two of them intersect

with EF [319–321]. The LS energy spectrum corresponding to the K and H points (kz=0

and 1) is, respectively, almost asymmetric and symmetric about EF , so that the magneto-

absorption spectrum presents the twin structures of same-direction asymmetric peaks and

the single symmetric peaks [313,321]. As for the ABC-stacked graphite, the LS bandwidths

are narrower than 10 meV, and only one is located at EF [322]. These result in a lot of

single absorption peaks with symmetric forms, being attributed to the merged excitations

from the K and H points [323].

It is also noticed that the LS energies of the AA- and

ABC-stacked graphites [317, 322] are characterized by the similar square-root dependence

on the quantum number and the magnetic-ﬁeld strength. A review study on the electronic

141

and optical properties has been ﬁnished for the 1D graphene nanoribbons [308], and it will

be extended to the 3D graphites.

Two-dimensional materials have attracted much attention since the discovery of graphene

in 2004. The layered group-IV condensed-matter systems with nano-scaled thickness and

hexagonal symmetry are very suitable for studying the novel physical, chemical and ma-

terial phenomena [324–330] and have a high potential for future technological applications

[331–333]. Silicene and germanene have been synthesized on metallic substrates [324–329].

Recently, tinene is successfully fabricated on a substrate of bismuth telluride [330]. Silicene,

germanene and tinene possess the buckled structure with a mixed sp2-sp3 orbital hybridiza-

tion rather than a sp2 one. Their spin-orbital interactions are suﬃciently strong so that

they can create an observable energy gap. The sp3 orbital bondings and the spin-orbital

interactions can dramatically change electronic structures; therefore, they are expected to

create the rich magnetic quantization.

The generalized tight-binding model could be further modiﬁed to comprehend the

diverse quantization phenomena in various condensed-matter systems. Recently, a new

Hamiltonian is proposed to explore the unusual magnetic properties of monolayer tinene

[334]. The magnetic quantization of the multi-orbital-, spin- and conﬁguration-dependent

Hamiltonian is solved by using the generalized tight-binding model. This should be very

helpful for the further development of the critical Hamiltonian models in the mainstream

materials. The Hamiltonian dimension of monolayer tinene is eight times large as that

of monolayer graphene. The buckled structure causes the matrix elements to be complex

at any wave vectors, so that the Hamiltonian diagonalization becomes diﬃcult. Tinene

is predicted to have two groups of low-lying LLs dominated by the 5pz and (5px,5py) or-

142

bitals, indicating the critical roles of multi-orbital bondings and spin-orbital coupling. The

important diﬀerences between tinene and graphene in the main characteristics of LLs in-

clude orbital components, spin conﬁgurations, localization centers, state degeneracy, and

magnetic- and electric-ﬁeld dependencies. Other quantized properties are worthy of de-

tailed investigations, such as optical spectra, Coulomb excitations and transport properties

of layered group-IV systems.
