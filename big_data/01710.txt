SPORADIC SIMPLE GROUPS AND LOCALLY TOROIDAL

POLYTOPES

DMITRII V. PASECHNIK

Abstract. We construct new ﬁnite rank 6 locally toroidal regular polytopes
of type {3, 3, 4, 3, 3}, disproving a long-standing conjecture of P. McMullen
and E. Schulte. These (abstract) polytopes are related to a well-known Y -
shaped presentation for the sporadic simple group Fi 22, and admit (covers of)
O+
8 (2):S3 as the automorphism group. We also discuss further extensions of
these abstract polytopes, and pose a number of open questions.

1. Introduction and results

Presentations of ﬁnite sporadic simple groups as quotients of Coxeter groups with
diagram Yαβγ, cf. Fig. 1(a), were discovered 30 years ago [2, 3, 13] and remain
a subject of considerable interest, cf. e.g.
[14, 4, 8]. For instance, the sporadic

simple group Fi 22 is a quotient of Y332, cf. Fig. 1(b) modulo certain relations [2,
p.233]. As explained in Section 3 below, these relations aﬀord the automorphism
φ of the diagram swapping b1, c1, and d1 with, respectively b2, c2, and d2. Thus
Fi 22 has a subgroup isomorphic to a quotient of the Coxeter group with Schläﬂi
symbol [3, 3, 4, 3, 3], i.e. with the string diagram we will also denote by [32, 4, 32],
cf. Fig. 2.

Groups of this kind arise in the study of abstract regular polytopes [10], objects
that may be viewed as quotients (satisfying intersection property, cf. [10]) of Cox-
eter complexes of Coxeter groups with r-node string diagram; here r is called the

rank. Abstract regular polytopes are classiﬁed according to topology of their vertex
ﬁgures and facets; they are called locally X if the latter have topology of X, e.g.
locally spherical if the vertex ﬁgures and facets are spherical. An up-to-date review
on group-theoretic approaches to the problem of classiﬁcation of abstract regular
polytopes may be found e.g. in [1].

Following a problem posed by B. Grünbaum [6, p.196], particular attention has
been paid to ﬁnite locally toroidal abstract regular polytopes, in this case the rank
is bounded from above by 6, cf. [10, Lemma 10A.1].

One of the three rank 6 cases is the case corresponding to the group [32, 4, 32],
cf. [10, Sect. 12D] (or [9, Sect. 7]), where a conjecturally complete list of the ﬁnite
examples is given, see [10, Table 12D1] (which is already in [9, Table V]) and [12,
Problem 18]. The main result of the present paper is to give three more exam-
ples, missing in that table. In more detail, the vertex ﬁgures {3, 3, 4, 3} and facets
{3, 4, 3, 3} here correspond to nontrivial ﬁnite quotients [3, 3, 4, 3]s and [3, 4, 3, 3]t
of the aﬃne Coxeter group ˜F4, i.e. the groups [3, 3, 4, 3] and [3, 4, 3, 3], with normal
Abelian subgroups either of the form q4 or q2 × (2q)2, with q ≥ 2, where we follow
notation from [2] to denote the direct product (Z/sZ)k of k copies of the cyclic
group of order s by sk. The case q4 is denoted in [9, 10] by {3, 3, 4, 3}(q,0,0,0), and
the case q2 × (2q)2 by {3, 3, 4, 3}(q,q,0,0) (and completely similarly for {3, 4, 3, 3}).

Theorem 1. Let Γ be a locally toroid rank 6 abstract regular polytope with facets
of type {3, 3, 4, 3}(2,2,0,0) and vertex ﬁgures of type {3, 3, 4, 3}(3,0,0,0). Then Γ is
ﬁnite and isomorphic to one of the four examples.
For 2 ≤ k ≤ 4, each example Γk is a k!-fold cover, of the example Γ1 with
v = 11200 = 26527 vertices and f = 14175 = 34527 facets, and the group
Ω := O+
8 (2):S3, of order g = 21336527. In particular, Γ is a quotient of Γ4, and the
group of Γk is isomorphic to Sk × Ω.

A number of comments on Theorem 1 are in order. The claim of ﬁniteness of
Γ (more precisely, the claim that any Γ is a quotient of Γ4) depends upon coset
enumeration, that was, for robustness purposes, carried out using two diﬀerent
implementations of the Todd-Coxeter algorithm: the built-in implementation of
GAP system [5], and ACE implementation by G. Havas and C. Ramsay [7], also
available as a GAP package. Both computations returned the index of the vertex
stabilizer, the subgroup F := 34:F4, in the group Θ (cf. Fig. 4) equal to 268800 =
293 · 527. We explain below that on the other hand the identiﬁcation of the group
of Γ1 does not need coset enumeration, and can be carried out by hand or with any
software capable of multiplying 24 × 24 matrices over F2, the ﬁeld of 2 elements.
It is worth mentioning that both F and the facet stabilizer (22.42):F4 are maximal

SPORADIC SIMPLE GROUPS AND LOCALLY TOROIDAL POLYTOPES

subgroups in Ω, although only F remains maximal upon restricting to the simple
subgroup O+

8 (2) of Ω.

We will also sketch how to establish the existence of Γ1 as a subgroup in Fi 22,

and show existence of Γk for 2 ≤ k ≤ 4 by a computer-free argument, as well.

Apart from this, we will discuss other connections to the Y -shaped presentations

already mentioned, and pose a number of open problems.

2. Notation and preliminaries

Our notation for Coxeter groups and diagrams is standard. A Coxeter group
G is generated by generators g1, . . . , gr, with the relations g2
i = (gigj)kij = 1, for
1 ≤ i < j ≤ r and 2 ≤ kij < ∞ (more generally, one may assume kij = ∞, but
we will not use this here). Graphically this is drawn as an r-node graph (diagram)
D(G) with kij − 2 edges joining vertices i and j (or, more generally, with labels kij
on the edges for which kij ≥ 3, but we will not use this here). Groups G for which
D(G) is connected are called irreducible; the term comes from the irreducibility of
the natural reﬂection representation of G with generators gi being reﬂections in Rr
with respect to hyperplanes Hi, with angles between Hi and Hj determined by kij.
For instance, the diagrams Yα,β,0, Yα,1,1, Y221, Y321, Y421 (cf. Fig. 1) correspond
to irreducible ﬁnite Coxeter groups Aα+β, Dα+2, E6, E7, and E8, which are also
the Weyl groups of the respective root systems so named. Note that the group
An is isomorphic to the symmetric group Sn+1. If D(G) is an r-path, maybe with
multiple edges, one talks about a string diagram, and encodes it as Schläﬂi symbol
[p12, p23, . . . , pr−1,r] (assuming the gi are ordered consecutively on the path D(G)).
We have already mentioned an example of a string diagram An; its Schläﬂi symbol
is [3n−1], where we abbreviated n − 1 consecutive 3s as 3n−1. Other examples
we need here of irreducible ﬁnite Coxeter groups with string diagram are F4, with
Schläﬂi symbol [3, 4, 3], cf. Fig. 2, and Bn, with Schläﬂi symbol [4, 3n−2].

Further, we are interested in quotients of G that satisfy intersection property,

that is

hgi | i ∈ Ii ∩ hgj | j ∈ Ji = hgk | k ∈ I ∩ Ji

for all I, J ⊆ {1, . . . , r}.

For instance, ﬁnite quotients p6:E6, of the aﬃne Coxeter group ˜E6, i.e. the Coxeter
group with diagram Y222, and ﬁnite quotients p4:F4 of the aﬃne Coxeter group
˜F4, (the group with Schläﬂi symbol [3, 3, 4, 3]) satisfy the intersection property
whenever p ≥ 2.

Quotients of G with string diagram are called string C-groups in [9, 10], and they
correspond to abstract r-polytopes. These are quotients of the Coxeter complex [15,
Chapter 2] of G, simplicial complexes built from the cosets of subgroups hgi | i ∈
Ii ≤ G, I ⊆ {1, . . . , r}, with respect to the respective normal subgroups (the latter
might be trivial). In particular for ﬁnite irreducible G they are classical polytopes:
n-simplices for An, n-cubes for Bn, the 24-cell {3, 4, 3} for F4, etc. Abstract regular
polytopes are also known as thin diagram geometries with string diagram, see e.g.
[11].

In the sequel we will need a classiﬁcation of abstract polytopes of type {3, 3, 4, 3}
and, dually, {3, 4, 3, 3}. Due to duality, it suﬃces to deal with the former, corre-
sponding to the quotients of the aﬃne Coxeter group ˜F4, see Fig. 3.

The latter acts on the lattice 1
2

Z4 of R4-vectors with coordinates being integer
or half-integer, cf. e.g. [9, p.23], and one needs to classify the invariant sublattices

of ﬁnite index. The latter may be generated (as a submodule) by a single vector,
of the shape s := (s, 0, 0, 0), or s′ := (s, s, 0, 0), with 2 ≤ s ∈ Z. Combining [9,
Theorems 3.4 and 3.5], one obtains the following.

Theorem 2. [9] Let Π be a ﬁnite abstract regular polytope {3, 3, 4, 3}t. Then for
t = s its group is isomorphic to [3, 3, 4, 3] subject to the extra relation (aστ σ)s = 1,
with τ and σ as on Fig. 3, whereas for t = s′ the extra relation is (aστ )2s = 1. (cid:3)

In what follows we denote the groups arising in Theorem 2 by [3, 3, 4, 3]t (or, if

more appropriate, by [3, 4, 3, 3]t).

3. Y -presentations and their twists

According to [2], the sporadic simple group Fi 22 has a presentation Y322 on

Fig. 1(b) subject to extra relations S = f12 = f21 = 1, where
S = (ab1c1ab2c2ab3c3)10,

fij = (abibjbkcicjdi)9, where {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3}.

The following trivial observation was the starting point of this project.

Lemma 3. Let φ be the automorphism of the diagram Y332 from Fig. 1(b). Then
Sφ = S, f φ
(cid:3)

12 = f21, f φ

21 = f12.

In view of this, Fi 22 contains a quotient Θ = hc3, b3, a, b1b2, c1c2, d1d2i of a

Coxeter group with diagram [32, 4, 32].

b1b2

[32, 4, 32]

One immediately identiﬁes the subgroup Θ > Θf = hb3, a, b1b2, c1c2, d1d2i with
a subgroup in 26:Sp6(2) presented by Y331 with extra relations f12 = f21 = 1, and
the subgroup Θ > Θv = hc3, b3, a, b1b2, c1c2i with a subgroup in 35:E6 presented by
Y222 with an extra relation S = 1, see [2, p.232-233].

Remark 1. The problem of recognising groups presented by Y332 with similar
extra relations has been brought to the author’s attention by Alexander A. Ivanov.
Namely, one is interested in the general setting where subgroups Y331 = ˜E7 and
Y222 = ˜E6 are made ﬁnite by factoring out the corresponding ﬁnite index invariant
sublattices.

It is strikingly parallel to the problem of classifying the ﬁnite quotients of
[3, 3, 4, 3, 3] we are concerned in this text. We hope to explore this topic further in
another publication.

SPORADIC SIMPLE GROUPS AND LOCALLY TOROIDAL POLYTOPES

Direct computations either by coset enumeration, or in appropriate E6- and E7-
invariant lattices allow one to identify Θv and Θf as groups classiﬁed by Theorem 2.
Namely, we have the following, where the last part is proved in [9, p.38] (that
basically amounts to checking that the subgroup hb3, a, b1b2, c1c2i of Θf is maximal
there).

Lemma 4. The following isomorphisms hold: Θf = [3, 4, 3, 3]2200, and Θv =
[3, 3, 4, 3]3000. The intersection property holds in Θ.
(cid:3)

At this point we can already conclude that the example of {3, 3, 4, 3, 3}-polytope
provided by Θ does not appear in [9, Table V], as the pair of vectors s = (3000)
and t = (2200) determining the vertex ﬁgure and the facet is not present there.

As φ on Fig. 1(b) induces an outer automorphism of Fi 22 and centralises Θ,
one concludes by inspecting the list of maximal subgroups of Fi 22 that H must
be a subgroup of O+
8 (2):S3, and enumeration of cosets of H in Fi 22, or analysis of
maximal subgroups of O+
8 (2):S3, identifying it
with the group of the example Γ1 in our Theorem 1.

8 (2):S3 conﬁrm that in fact H = O+

Problem 1. The question of understanding of similarly constructed subgroups
of the Monster-related groups with Y -presentations is largely open, although they
ought to exist by arguments similar to the Y332-case considered here.

Preliminary experiments with enumerating cosets of one of our ﬁnite [32, 4, 32]-
quotients, namely the group of Γ1, isomorphic to O+
8 (2):S3, in [32, 4, 33], indicates
that this is gives the group F4(2), which is a subgroup of a quotient of Y333 isomor-
phic to 2 E6(2). More precisely, the enumeration returns index 12673024, which is
4 times the index of O+
8 (2):S3 in F4(2). We should also mention that the [3, 4, 33]-
subgroup in this group is isomorphic to L4(3):2, shown to be a subgroup in F4(2)
by L. Soicher [14], with an argument involving a diagram automorphism similar to
φ

4. Another existence proof of Γ1, and existence of its covers

Here we present another, direct, existence proof of Γ1, and complete the proof

of Theorem 1 by constructing its covers.

We begin by writing down a presentation P for Θ, the group of the universal
cover (for the term, cf. [10, Sect. 3D]) of the examples from the Theorem. In our
context it simply means that in P we do not impose any relations that involve all
the generators. As there is only one conjugacy class of subgroups isomorphic to
F4 both in [3, 3, 4, 3](3000) and in [3, 4, 3, 3](2200), we can conclude that this group is
unique, and P is

embeds as the permutation group in its natural action on the vertices of the 24-cell.
The latter action has an imprimitivity system with three blocks of size 8, which will
correspond to the three natural 8-dimensional submodules for O+
8 (2):2. We choose
the generators so that the blocks are {1..8}, {9..16}, and {17..24}, and so that the
centre of F4 is the permutation (1, 2)(3, 4) . . . (23, 24). Let us slighly abuse notation
and view the following as speciﬁcations of 24 × 24-permutation matrices over F2.
ˆb = Y

ˆc =(3, 6)(4, 5)(11, 14)(12, 13)(17, 24)(18, 23),

In terms of the 24-cell, the size 8 imprimitivity block of a vertex v consists of the
antipodal to v vertex of the 24-cell, and the vertices antipodal to v in each of the 6
octahedra (facets of the 24-cell) on v. The stabiliser of the block in F4 is hˆb, ˆc, ˆd, ˆτ i.

denote the matrix with 1 in the position ij and 0 elsewhere.

Now it is routine to check that the relations in P hold for just deﬁned ˆa,. . . , ˆf . As
well, they leave invariant the quadratic form Φ := P24
i=1 x2i−1x2i; this is
immediate for the permutation matrices ˆb,. . . , ˆe, as they commute with the centre
of hˆb, ˆc, ˆd, ˆei, and a direct computation for ˆa and ˆf .

j=1 x2

As this point we have ˆΘ ≤ O+

8 (2):S3. To see that the latter is in fact equality,
one can either inspect the list of the maximal subgroups of O+
8 (2):S3, or investigate
the action of the stabiliser H := hˆa, ˆb, ˆc, ˆd, ˆτ , ˆf i of the subspace spanned by the ﬁrst
8 coordinates in ˆΘ, and see that it acts transitively on the 135 nonzero Φ-isotropic
vectors there, by computing the orbit of the all-1 vector, and further identifying H
with a rank 3 permutation group O+
8 (2):2 in its natural action on isotropic vectors.
(cid:3)

Finally, the intersection property holds, by [9].

Let ψ : Θ → S4 be a map deﬁned on generators of Θ, with ψ(a) := (1, 2),
ψ(b) := (2, 3), ψ(c) := (3, 4), and ψ(d) = ψ(e) = ψ(f ) = (). It turns out that it
extends to a homomorphism onto. (Note that there is no symmetry here: if we try
to send a, b, c to the identity instead, we get a trivial group).

Lemma 6. The map ψ is a homomorphism onto. Also, there is a homomorphism
from Θ onto S4 × O+

8 (2):S3, with its image the group of Γ4.

Proof. For the ﬁrst part, observe that the Coxeter relations of Θ hold in ψ(Θ).
Also, ψ(σ) = () and ψ(τ ) = ψ(c) = (3, 4). It follows that the rest of the relations
hold, as well, and we are done.

For the second part, we construct an embedding of Θ into G := S4 × O+

8 (2):S3 =
ψ(Θ) × ˆΘ. Consider the subgroup H of G generated by ψ(a)ˆa,. . . , ψ(f ) ˆf . Trivially,
by checking the relations, H is a homomorphic image of Θ.

It remains to show H = G. Consider an element of O+

8 (2) of order 5, as
a word ˆw := w(ˆa, . . . , ˆf ) in our generators, and the corresponding word w :=
w(ψ(a)ˆa, . . . , ψ(f ) ˆf ) ∈ H. Then w = w(ψ(a), . . . , ψ(f )) ˆw. Thus w12 = ˆw2 ∈ ˆΘ is
8 (2) is generated by such elements, and as ˆΘ is generated by
of order 5. As O := O+
O and ˆd, ˆe, ˆf , we have ˆΘ ≤ H. Therefore H = G, as claimed.
