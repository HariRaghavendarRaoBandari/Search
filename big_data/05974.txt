We investigate the ferrimagnetism and ferroelectricity of bulk NiFe2O4 with tetragonal P 4122
symmetry by means of density functional calculations using generalized gradient approximation +
Hubbard U approach. Special attention is paid to ﬁnding the most energetically favorable conﬁg-
uration on magnetic ordering and further calculating the reliable spontaneous electric polarization.
With the fully optimized crystalline structure of the most stable conﬁguration, the spontaneous po-
larization is obtained to be 23 µC/cm2 along the z direction, which originates from the hybridization
between the 3d states of the Fe3+ cation and the 2p states of oxygen induced by Jahn-Teller eﬀect.

Magnetic ferroelectrics that possess ferroelectricity to-
gether with some form of magnetic order like ferromag-
netic, antiferromagnetic, or ferrimagnetic property in the
same crystalline phase have attracted much interest due
to their fundamental physics and a great promise for
applications in future information technology [2–8].
In
particular, improper multiferroics in which a ferroelec-
tric polarization is induced by electronic correlation ef-
fects such as non-centrosymmetric spin, charge, and or-
bital ordering, is currently under intensive study [9–12].
This is related to the suggestion that a magneto-electric
(ME) coupling in improper multiferroics is expected to
be stronger than in proper case, because both dipolar
and magnetic orderings share the same physical origin
and occur at the same temperature [9].

In the early days of searching improper multiferroics,
spin ordering was accepted to be a main driving force
for the manifestation of ferroelectric polarization; ex-
amples include rare earth manganites RMnO3 [13–16]
and RMn2O5 [17–19] (R = Tb, Ho, Dy, Lu,
. . .),
and Li-Cu-based oxides LiCu2O2 and LiCuVO4 [24].
These compounds, however, have antiferromagnetic or-
der, which makes their application strongly limited be-
cause of zero magnetization (and therefore uncontrolla-
bility), and what is worse, they have quite small elec-
tric polarization (≤0.1 µC/cm2). On the other hand,
it was found from ﬁrst-principles and experiments that,
in some ferrites including magnetite Fe3O4 [21–23] and
rare earth ferrites RFe2O4 (R = Y, Yb or Lu) [20, 25–
27], charge ordering or spin-charge ordering induces a
spontaneous polarization of remarkably large value: up
to 5 µC/cm2 in monoclinic Fe3O4 [23] and even tens of
µC/cm2 in hexagonal LuFe2O4 [26], comparable to those
of conventional perovskite ABO3-type ferroelectrics as
well as proper multiferroics. In these ferrites, moreover,
the charge and spin degrees of freedom of electrons can
be controlled simultaneously, because they have ferrimag-
netic order and thus may have non-zero magnetization.
Recently, two primary non-polar distortions like tilting
and rotation of oxygen octahedra driven by electronic

factors (i.e., Jahn-Teller eﬀects) were found to induce
the breaking of inversion symmetry and produce a large
ferroelectric polarization in the new class of double per-
ovskites AA′BB′O6; SrTiO3/PbTiO3 superlattice [28],
NaLaMnWO6 [9, 29] with a very large polarization of
about 16 µC/cm2, and Ca3Mn2O7 [10] are typical com-
pounds belonged to this materials class. These materials
have weak ferromagnetism and thus a signiﬁcant ME cou-
pling is expected. Despite the great progress in the ﬁeld
of improper multiferroics, the eﬀort to ﬁnd new mecha-
nism and design new materials is being continued.

In this letter, we present that spinel-type nickel ferrite
NiFe2O4 (NFO) is a promising candidate for improper
multiferroics with ﬁnite magnetization and considerably
large polarization, based on the ﬁrst-principles density
functional theory (DFT) calculations. In fact, spinels ex-
hibit several unusual features including magnetoelectric-
ity and multiferroicity [9]. From the experiment, it was
established that the bulk NFO shows soft ferrimagnetic
ordering below relatively high transition temperature of
850 K with a magnetization of 2 µB per formula unit
(f.u.) [30]. In the recent experiment [31], moreover, high
dielectric permitivity was observed in NFO nanoparti-
cles to be ranged from 60 to 600 at diﬀerent frequencies
and temperatures. This is comparable with the conven-
tional ferroelectrics and therefore implies the presence of
spontaneous polarization in the bulk NFO. However, the
ferroelectricity of bulk NFO has neither been calculated
nor measured yet, though the intensive studies of elec-
tronic [32–34], magnetic [35], and epitaxial strain and
magnetoelastic properties [36–38] have been conducted.
Which is the most stable structure?–It is well accepted
that NFO crystallizes in the completely inverse spinel
structure with a face-centered cubic space group F d¯3m
(No. 227), where half of the Fe3+ cations occupy the
tetrahedral A-sites (8a), the rest of Fe3+ and Ni2+ cations
are equally distributed over the octahedral B-sites (16d),
and the sites of oxygen anions are distinguished into O1
and O2. However, it was not clear how Fe3+ and Ni2+
cations are distributed over B-sites; when distributing

2

proximation (GGA) [42] was used for the exchange-
correlation functional with on-site Coulomb interaction
(i.e. GGA+U ) to take into account the strong correlation
eﬀect of Fe and Ni 3d states [43]. As in the previous cal-
culations [35, 43], the values of U and J for Fe are 4.5 eV
and 0.89 eV, and for Ni, diﬀerent U values ranged from 2
eV to 6 eV, all with J = 1 eV, were tested. The USPPs
are provided in the code, where the valence electrons are
taken as 10, 16, and 6 for Ni, Fe and O atoms [44]. The
kinetic energy cutoﬀ for plane-wave expansion was set to
be 40 Ry and the k-points to be (5 × 5 × 3) for the Bril-
louin zone integration. Marzari-Vanderbilt cold smearing
technique [45] with a gaussian spreading factor of 0.02 Ry
was applied. We have used tetragonal unit cells contain-
ing 4 formula units (28 atoms) with ﬁxed experimental
lattice constants a = b = 5.89 ˚A and c = 8.34 ˚A [30].
The convergence threshold of forces on ions was set to be
1.0×10−4 Ry/Bohr.

For all the tested UNi values of 2, 4 and 6 eV, the order
of four spin conﬁgurations in total energy was always like
duu < udu < uud < uuu with the almost equal energy
diﬀerence of 0.2 eV/f.u. between two spin conﬁgurations
in turn, and this is the same in both P 4122 and Imma
space groups. Eventually the lowest energy structure was
turned out to be duu (or udd) conﬁguration for both
P 4122 and Imma. It was also found that P 4122 phase is
∼0.02 eV/f.u. lower in energy than Imma phase in each
spin conﬁguration and this does not change with the UNi
value.

Our calculations show that the total magnetization
varies with change of UNi value; in the case of duu spin
conﬁguration, the UNi value that gives the total magne-
tization of 2 µB/f.u. consistent with the experimental
value for the bulk NFO [30], was 3.24 eV. Therefore, we
will use the UNi value of 3.24 eV for the following calcu-
lations and analysis.

In Table I, we show the obtained coordinates of
atoms and geometries of oxygen octahedra around B-
sites cations for the lowest spin conﬁguration duu phases
with both P 4122 and Imma space groups. While both
distortions and tiltings of octahedra due to Jahn-Teller
eﬀect are observed in P 4122 phase, only slight tiltings
are observed in Imma phase.

Multiferroicity of bulk NFO–Here we focus our major
interest on the ferroelectricity of NFO because its mag-
netic property with ferrimagnetic order is well accepted
at present [35] as also conﬁrmed in this study. Let us con-
sider the aforementioned crystalline symmetries of two
phases of bulk NFO. As shown clearly in Fig. 1, the
P 4122 phase does not have inversion symmetry but the
Imma phase has a space inversion center. Therefore, the
P 4122 phase is allowed to have a spontaneous polariza-
tion, while for the Imma phase the spontaneous polariza-
tion could not be expected. In addition, the Imma phase
can be a centrosymmetric reference phase for the calcu-
lation of spontaneous polarization of the P 4122 phase.

What leads to whether or not the presence of inversion
symmetry is just B-sites ordering of cations; in the former

metries with duu spin conﬁguration of cations FeA, FeB and
NiB, where u and d means spin up and down, respectively.

Fe3+ and Ni2+ over B-sites in the F d¯3m unit cell with
the periodic boundary condition rather than in inﬁnite
bulk crystal, it might be possible to generate diﬀerent
space groups whose symmetries are lowered from F d¯3m.
It is only recent year that, through the Raman spectra
measurements, both NFO single crystals [39] and thin
ﬁlms [40] exhibit short range B-site ordering with tetrag-
onal P 4122 (No. 91) (or equivalently P 4322) symmetry,
though the phase with orthorhombic Imma (No. 74)
symmetry was not ruled out.

Such experimental ﬁnding that NFO has short range
ordering was aﬃrmed by the recent ﬁrst-principles
works [35–38]. Among possible space groups with sym-
metries lowering from F d¯3m created by distributing
Fe3+ and Ni2+ cations on 8 B-sites, two relatively high-
symmetry space groups P 4122 and Imma were found to
be energetically the most favorable, and further P 4122
slightly lower than Imma [35]. Therefore, it is only natu-
ral that we adopt the tetragonal P 4122 and orthorhombic
Imma structures as our starting phases of bulk NFO.

Next, we should consider the possible spin conﬁgura-
tions of cations, which help to illustrate the nature of
the magnetic property of bulk NFO. Denoting spin up
and down as u and d, there are eight spin conﬁgurations
of cations, FeA, FeB and NiB in due order: ddd, ddu,
dud, duu, udd, udu, uud, and uuu. However, considering
that spin inversion will give the same total energy to the
origin with only opposite magnetization as conﬁrmed by
our calculation, the spin conﬁgurations to consider here
reduce to four cases: duu, dud, uud, and uuu. Fig. 1
shows the unit cells of two phases with the duu spin ar-
rangement.

We carried out atomic relaxations for the four spin
conﬁgurations with P 4122 and Imma space groups re-
spectively, using ultrasoft pseudopotential (USPP) plane
wave method within spin-polarized DFT as implemented
in Quantum ESPRESSO code (version 5.1) [41]. The
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient ap-

phase it is characterized by · · ·−B′−B′′−· · · chains along
[100] and [010] directions, while in the latter case the B-
sites ordering is characterized by · · ·−B′ −B′ −· · · chains
along [100] direction and · · · − B′′ − B′′ − · · · chains along
[010] direction. As pointed out in Ref. [39], the transition
from the disordered F d¯3m phase to the ordered P 4122 or
Imma phase is of ﬁrst order and furthermore the phase
transition between P 4122 and Imma can be occurred by
the exchange of FeB in [100] direction and NiB in [010]
direction or vice versa.

According to the modern theory of polarization [46,
47], the spontaneous polarization of P 4122 NFO is ob-
tained by calculating the polarization diﬀerence between
ferroelectric P 4122 phase and centrosymmetric Imma
reference phase, ∆P = PF E − PRef = ∆Pion + ∆Pel.
The ionic contribution Pion is calculated by the simple
“point charge model”, while the electronic contribution
Pel by the Berry phase method as already applied to
perovskite ferroelectrics by one of the authors [48]. The
calculations were carried out on the most stable duu spin
conﬁgurations. The polarizations of Imma NFO for all
kinds of spin conﬁgurations were calculated to be zero,
i.e., both ionic and electronic contributions to be zero. In
P 4122 NFO, the ionic contributions to the polarization
were also zero, but the electronic contributions were cal-
culated to be −23.0 µC/cm2 along the c direction with
the polarization quantum modulo e|c|/Ω = 46.0 µC/cm2
(|c| = 8.34 ˚A, and Ω = 289.33 ˚A3). This indicates the
P 4122 NFO to be improper multiferroics (with the fer-
rimagnetic order as discussed below). When comparing
with the conventional improper multiferroics, the calcu-
lated polarization is remarkably large, but not very sur-
prising as compared to other recently found spinel ferrites
like Fe3O4, LuFe2O4 and NaLaMnWO6 [20, 23, 26, 29].
We note that the polarization comes from spin down elec-

trons for the case of duu spin conﬁguration, while for
the case of udd spin conﬁguration (another lowest-energy
spin conﬁguration with the opposite magnetic moment to
the duu conﬁguration) it is from spin up electrons. This
feature is very precious for spintronic applications be-
cause it gives the way to control the only electrons with
a certain spin direction by applying external electric ﬁeld.
To see an electronic essence behind having large po-
larization, we resort to the electronic properties of bulk
NFO. The plots of density of states (DOS) (Fig. 2) calcu-
lated for P 4122 NFO with duu spin conﬁguration show
the band gaps of 1.88 eV for spin up electrons and 2.30
eV for spin down ones, which are in good agreement with
the recent theoretical and experimental values [32]. The
atom-projected partial DOS indicates that the 3d states
of cations hybridize strongly with the O 2p states for both
spin up and down electrons. Moreover, we can see that
below Fermi level the NiB 3d electrons play the major
role for both spin up and down, while above Fermi level
the FeA 3d electrons for spin up and the FeB 3d electrons
for spin down play the dominant role.

To illustrate how P 4122 NFO has large polarization,
we calculated maximally localized Wannier functions
(MLWF) of valence bands for spin up and down states
in the duu spin conﬁguration, and recalculated the po-
larization by summing up the displacements of MLWF
centers ∆r using the following equation,

Pel = −

e
Ω X

m

(∆rm,↑ + ∆rm,↓),

where m runs over MLWF centers (with a charge −e
located at rm) in the unit cell with the volume Ω and ar-
rows denote the spin states. In accordance with the Berry
phase calculation, the sum of the displacements of MLWF
centers for spin up state was calculated to be zero in all
Cartesian directions (i.e., Pm ∆αm,↑ = 0; α = x, y, z),

while one for spin down states was to be 4.16 ˚A in the
z direction with also zero values in the x, y directions
(i.e., Pm ∆xm,↓ = Pm ∆ym,↓ = 0, Pm ∆zm,↓ = 4.16
˚A). The polarization calculated by the above formula
with the relevant variables (the sum of the displacements
Pm ∆zm,↓ = 4.16 ˚A and the unit cell volume Ω = 289.33
˚A3) gives exactly the same value as the Berry phase cal-
culation.

What causes the ferroelectric polarization?–To clarify
the mechanism that leads to such a large ferroelectric po-
larization in bulk NFO, we made a careful analysis of the
electronic properties including removal of degeneracy in
B-sites cations through Jahn-Teller eﬀect and hybridiza-
tion between 3d states of Fe3+ cations on B-sites and 2p
states of oxygens.

As mentioned above, the key diﬀerence between ferro-
electric P 4122 phase and centrosymmetric Imma phase
is the B-sites ordering of cations. While in both phases
the 3d states of cations were lifted into eg and t2g states
owing to the crystal ﬁeld eﬀects, the · · · − B′ − B′′ − · · ·
chains along [100] and [010] directions in the case of
P 4122 phase, being similar to the double perovskites,
induce another eﬀect, i.e., Jahn-Teller eﬀect, which lifts
the double degeneracy of eg state and the triple degen-
eracy of t2g state. In the context of atomistic structure,
Jahn-Teller eﬀects cause slight distortions and tiltings of
the oxygen octahedra in the relaxed P 4122 phase, break-
ing their local symmetries. However, the ionic contribu-
tions to the polarization by locally distorted and tilted
octahedra add up to zero, reﬂecting the fact that to-
tal ionic symmetry remains centrosymmetric during the
structural relaxation. In addition to the crystal ﬁeld and
Jahn-Teller eﬀects, spin degree of freedom gives rise to
the spin splitting. In Fig. 3, we show the lifting of energy
levels of Fe3+ and Ni2+ cations by such eﬀects. These en-
ergy level splittings can be shown from the band structure
and partial DOS for spin up and down channels.

FIG. 3: (color online) Schematic view of Fe3+ and Ni2+ energy
levels showing the removal of degeneracy

The calculated MLWFs pointed towards the impor-
tance of the lowest empty dz2 state of spin down chan-
nel in conduction bands of Fe3+ cation, introducing the
hybridization with the pz state of oxygen. This p-d hy-
bridization leads to breaking of the inversion symmetry
driven by the electronic degree of freedom. In order to
illustrate how the p-d hybridization breaks the inversion

symmetry, we display the MLWFs associated with the
3d states of Fe3+ and Ni2+ cations for spin down case in
the duu conﬁguration. As shown in Fig. 4, the hybridiza-
tion between the dz2 state of the Fe3+ cation on B-site
and the 2p state of the oxygen is clearly proved, show-
ing the character of the pz of oxygen and the dz2 of the
Fe3+ cation. Here, we place great emphasis on the fact
that the ferroelectric property is originated from the p-d
hybridization induced by Jahn-Teller eﬀect, and the mag-
netic property also comes from the 3d states of cations.
We note that such properties give rise to the valuable ap-
plications for magnetoelectric actuators, spintronics and
so on, since they are originated from the same electronic
degree of freedom.

In conclusion, we have investigated the ferroelectricity
induced by p-d hybridization in ferrimagnetic NiFe2O4
with P4122 space group symmetry by means of GGA+U
method. The polarization of 23 µC/cm2 is considerably
large, compared to other improper multiferroics, and the
net magnetic moment of 2 µB/f.u.
is also large. This
work sheds light on that the driving force of the large fer-
roelectric polarization is just the hybridization between
the empty 3d-states of Fe3+ cations on B-sites and the
2p-states of the oxygen anions, induced by Jahn-Teller
eﬀect. Although in ferrimagnetic NiFe2O4 with P4122
space group such a large ferroelectric polarization was
not yet measured experimentally, we believe that our
ﬁndings will be conﬁrmed by further experimental and
theoretical studies.
