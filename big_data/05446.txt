Abstract

We present an original undergraduate level compilation for the physics
of electromechanical systems with special attention to power ﬂow. An
approach based on energy considerations is presented that is specially
suited to compute the mechanical and electrical actions of electromagnetic
ﬁelds and to draw power ﬂowcharts that clarify the path taken by energy
in typical devices. The procedure guarantees energy conservation and
provides a consistent way for auditing the power ﬂow.

Introduction

Classical textbooks on electromagnetics [1],[3],[4],[6],[7] currently taught in un-
dergraduate engineering courses often place great emphasis on electromagnetic
induction. It is not surprising, since it plays a paramount role in energy trans-
port and electromechanical conversion in today’s technology. Yet, in our per-
spective, a more thorough analysis of the interplay of electrical, mechanical and
magnetic variables in a typical machine would also ﬁt into an undergraduate
engineering course on electromagnetics. It is our intention to sketch the theory

1

of such a systems placing a special focus on power ﬂow tracking and chart-
ing. On the other hand, texts on electromechanical systems, often appeared
in a Mechatronics context[2, 5] make use of analytical mechanics to provide
the mathematical framework for a generalized formulation of the subject. We
propose a way in between the raw Lorentz force and the analytical mechan-
ics approach, which is better suited for students with no previous course on
theoretical mechanics.
It is bases on power balances which, in turn, rely on
the conservative character of the energy in electromagnetic systems in the low
frequency regime, under which most electromechanical systems operate.

We consider electromagnetic currents at low frequencies, meaning that sig-
nals propagating at the speed of light do not experience a signiﬁcant change of
phase when they come through the electric machine. We will further assume
that conduction currents ﬂow in closed paths (circuits). They may move, typ-
ically rotate about a ﬁxed axis, and accordingly, dynamical actions generate a
mechanical power ﬂow. Faraday’s law, on its turn, induces electromotive forces
in circuits, so that there is also electrical power.

This lesson aims at providing a systematic way for computing mechanical
and electromotive forces and power ﬂows and check that they are consistent
with energy conservation. We do it both analytically and graphically.

Considering the volume density of power delivered by the electromagnetic ﬁeld

3 Electromotive and mechanical forces on cir-

cuits

Next, we set the scenario of electromechanics with currents. A set of n electric
circuits, each one being traversed by a magnetic ﬂux Φj j = 1, . . . , n, is posi-
tioned by a collection of m generalized geometrical coordinates q1, . . . , qm. Each
electric circuit is given energy at a rate −Ij ˙Φj and every mechanical degree of
freedom receives a power Fk ˙qk, where Fk is the generalized force corresponding
to the k−th generalized coordinate qk. As the action of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld on conduction currents is conservative, it follows that

n(cid:88)

j=1

d Uem

d t

=

Ij ˙Φj −

m(cid:88)

(7)

whence, if energy U is expressed as a function of the ﬂuxes and coordinates

U = F (Φj, qk), we readily arrive at

Ij =

∂ F
∂ Φj

∂ F
∂ qk

(8)

Fk = −

Eq.7 implies a way to compute Uem by raising the set of currents from zero to
their ﬁnal values keeping the positions constant

where the sets of I1, . . . , In currents and q1, . . . , qm coordinates are denoted
generically as I, q. It is often useful to perform a Legendre transformation and
deﬁne the co-energy W as

so that

(11)

When F (Φj, qk) is a quadratic function of the ﬂuxes, energy and co-energy are
equal U = W . This is the case in linear systems.

4 Generalized forces on circuits from external

magnetic ﬂuxes

In this section we consider the mechanical actions on a set C1 of n1 electric
circuits originated by ﬁelds created by other set C2 of n2 currents which are not
exactly known or we are not interested in. It is assumed that the magnetic ﬂux
through the (cid:96)-th circuit in C1 can be split into two contributions: Γj, Ψj, from
C1, C2, respectively. All we need is an expression for the ﬂuxes Ψ(cid:96)j(qk, t) ; (cid:96) =
1, . . . , n ; j = 1, . . . , n through the (cid:96)-th circuit in C1 caused by the j-th current
in C2. From Eq.8,

Fk = −

Ij(φ, qk)dφj =

∂ F
∂ qk

(cid:88)

where

F (Φi, qk) =

(cid:88)

whose partial derivative yields

(15)

If we consider mechanical actions on a coordinate qk that positions circuits in
C1 from ﬁelds created by circuits in C2, the currents taken into account are only
those in C1 and the ﬂuxes Ψj from C2 do not depend on said currents. Thus,

I(cid:96)(Φ,qk)

I(cid:96)

d [Ψ(cid:96)(qk, t) + Γ(cid:96)(qk, t)]

d t

(18)

When all Ψj(qk, t) do not depend on time, their contribution to the sum of
Eqs.17,18 cancels, meaning that they do not contribute any power to C1, and
they act just as catalyst for electro-mechanical energy conversion.

It is possible to deﬁne a partial potential energy for the circuits in C1.

which, combined with Eqs.17,18 yields

d Up
d t

+ Pm,C1 + Pe,C1 = 0

(21)

so that, when external ﬂuxes are constant, electrical and mechanical powers
come only at the expense of the partial potential Up.

Finally, as a particularization of Eq.16, it is worth noting that when qk
determines the position the j-th circuit the mechanical action of an external
ﬁeld whose magnetic ﬂux through the circuit is Ψ(qk) reads

Fk = Ij

∂ Ψj(qk, t)

∂ qk

(22)

5 Power ﬂowchart

In this section we write down expressions for energy ﬂows in electromechani-
cal systems. Energy is conserved and accordingly positive and negative ﬂuxes
should balance out. The rate of decrease of the potential energy Uem should
match the power delivered by the electromagnetic ﬁeld to the electric circuits
and the mechanical degrees of freedom. We next check that this is the case. The
j-th electric circuit receives a power from the electromagnetic ﬁeld Pe,j given
by

An equation in which an addition of powers equals zero is a power balance
equation. It can be drawn as node in a graph if the edges represent the powers.
Fig.1 depicts the power balance Eq.26 in the case n = 2, m = 2.

Figure 2: Flowchart of the path followed by the electrical and mechanical pow-
ers power Pe,1, Pm,1 comming from Eq.26. Pe,1 combines with power from an
electrical source PS,1 to be dissipated as Joule power PJ,1 by a resistor, whereas
the mechanical power is used to overcome a mechanical friction Pr,1 and increase
a kinetic energy T .

All mechanical and electrical powers can be traced further to the mechanical
or electrical systems they are fed to or drawn from. Fig.2 ampliﬁes the scope

For example, the electrical power delivered by the ﬁeld to the ﬁrst circuit Pe,1
enters a new balance in which it is added to the power coming from an electric
source PS,1 to feed a resistor where PJ,1 is dissipated. The mechanical power
that ﬂows into the ﬁrst geometrical degree of freedom also enters a mechanical
power balance that splits it into a power dissipated by mechanical friction Pr,1
and the time derivative of the kinetic energy or a moving part.

Figure 3: Possible complete ﬂowchart of power in a n = 2, m = 2 electrome-
chanical system.

Fig.3 includes the analysis of all power coming from the electromagnetic
ﬁeld. New equations can be obtained by adding those of any number of nodes.
Internal power ﬂows are canceled out. Fig.4 represents the equation coming
from all the nodes inside the closed red curve, which yields a global power audit
of the system.

Figure 4: By selecting a group of nodes in the graph a new equation is obtained
adding the powers represented by all the external edges. If all the nodes are
selected, we get a global energy audit of the system.

When there is an external source of constant magnetic ﬁelds, we have proved

Besides, electric amd mechanical powers from the constant magnetic ﬁeld cancel
out. It is represented in Fig.5.

Figure 5: When a system is under constant magnetic ﬁelds generated elsewhere,
two balances emerge. One is for the electrical and mechanical powers induced
by the local magnetic ﬁelds and the other accounts for the cancellation of the
electrical and mechanical powers combined coming from the external sources.

6.1 Variable reluctance circuit

Figure 6: An electromechanical system consisting of a variable reluctance mag-
netic circuit. The magnetomotive force is supplied by a current I wound N
times around the core. The rotating part makes the reluctance dependent on
the rotation angle α. The mechanical forces from the magnetic ﬁeld tend to
minimize the reluctance.

As a ﬁrst example we may consider the system of Fig.6. An electric source
supplies an electric current I which is wound N times around the ferromagnetic
core of a magnetic circuit. Part of the circuit may rotate by an angle α, thus
making the reluctance R(α) variable. It can be approximated by

R(α) =

2e

µ0ha(2β − α)

(27)

where a, e, β are geometrical parameters read from Fig.6 and h is the height
(unseen dimension) of the system.

It is now straightforward to check that Eqs.29,32 and the time derivative of
Eq.30 add to zero, which indicates that the energy balance matches.

Then electrical and mechanical powers may enter further balances. Typi-
cally, there is a power furnished by the electrical source VsI and a Joule dissi-
pation in the resistance of the wire RI 2. There may also be a gain in kinetic
energy ˙T of the rotary part and a mechanical viscous friction dissipation b ˙α2,
as represented in the ﬂowchart of Fig.7.

Figure 7: Power ﬂowchart for the variable reluctance system of Fig.6. Power
from the source is traced down to the increase of kinetic energy, mechanical
friction, Joule dissipation and energy storage in the ﬁeld.

6.2 Electromagnetic clutch

We may next consider the electromechanical system of Fig.8 made by two elec-
tric circuits C1, C2 which may rotate about a ﬁxed axis z, through angles α, β
respectively. Both circuits may have voltage sources VS1, VS2, resistances R1, R2
and are traversed by electric currents I1, I2, respectively. The mechanical rota-
tions encounter viscous friction torques −b ˙α,−b ˙β, and may increase the kinetic

It is now straightforward to check Eq.7 adding the powers of Eqs.36,38 and
40 add to zero. The electrical and mechanical powers delivered by the ﬁeld
enter further power balances. Electrical powers may be added to those supplied
by other sources and dissipate in resistors. Mechanical powers may increase
kinetic energies and dissipate by frictional forces. A complete power ﬂowchart
for the system is represented in Fig.9. We can select all nodes to write down
the equation:

Figure 9: Power ﬂowchart for the system of Fig.8. The power delivered (or
absorbed) by the electric sources may be traced down to dissipative losses in
resistors and viscous frictions and kinetic energy gains in the rotating masses.
