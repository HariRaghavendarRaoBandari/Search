We investigate the isoscalar and isovector E1 response of neutron-rich nuclei, within a semi-
classical transport model employing eﬀective interactions for the nuclear mean-ﬁeld. In particular,
we adopt the recently introduced SAMi-J Skyrme interactions, whose parameters are speciﬁcally
tuned to improve the description of spin-isospin properties of nuclei. Our analysis evidences a
relevant degree of isoscalar/isovector mixing of the collective excitations developing in neutron-rich
systems. Focusing on the low-lying strength emerging in the isovector response, we show that this
energy region essentially corresponds to the excitation of isoscalar-like modes, which also contribute
to the isovector response owing to their mixed character. Considering eﬀective interactions which
mostly diﬀer in the isovector channels, we observe that these mixing eﬀects increase with the slope L
of the symmetry energy at saturation density, leading to a larger strength in the low-energy region of
the isovector response. This result appears connected to the increase, with L, of the neutron/proton
asymmetry at the surface of the considered nuclei, i.e., to the extension of the neutron skin.

INTRODUCTION

The dynamics of many-body interacting systems often
manifests the development of collective patterns. The un-
derstanding of such fascinating properties of complex sys-
tems is quite helpful to shed light on fundamental prop-
erties of the interaction among the constituent particles.
In particular, the investigation of collective phenomena
represents one of the most challenging and lively research
ﬁelds in nuclear physics. In nuclei, giant resonances are
well established collective states, with an energy larger
than the particle separation energy [1]. An example is
the giant dipole resonance (GDR), which is still the ob-
ject of intense investigation. With the advent of the ﬁrst-
generation exotic-beam facilities, much attention was di-
rected towards the features of the collective (multipole)
response of unstable nuclei. Restricting the discussion to
isovector dipole excitations of neutron-rich systems, one
generally observes a stronger fragmentation of strength
than in nuclei with small neutron excess, with signiﬁcant
components located in an energy domain well below that
of the GDR [2–11]. The nature of the low-lying excita-
tions is still a matter of ongoing discussion [12–17]. Un-
like the GDR, where neutrons and protons move against
each other, this low-lying strength could be associated
with an oscillation of the outermost neutrons (neutron
skin) against the N=Z core. This mode is commonly re-
ferred to as a ‘soft’ or ‘pygmy’ dipole resonance (PDR).
This interpretation was already discussed in the early
1990s [18, 19] and is strongly supported by recent rela-
tivistic random phase approximation (RPA) calculations
[20–22]. On the other hand, other microscopic studies

predict a larger fragmentation of the GDR strength [23]
and the absence of collective states in the low-lying exci-
tation region [24], thus relating the observed strength to
a particular structure of the single-particle levels. There-
fore a number of critical questions concerning the nature
of the PDR still remain.

It is worth noting that the low-lying electric dipole E1
strength in unstable neutron-rich nuclei is currently dis-
cussed also in the astrophysical context, in connection
with the reaction rates in the r-process nucleosynthesis.
It appears that the existence of the pygmy mode could
have a strong impact on the abundances of the elements
in the Universe [25]. Moreover, as it has been evidenced
in mean-ﬁeld based calculations, the features of neutron-
rich nuclei, such as pygmy mode and neutron skin, are
clearly related to the isovector terms of the nuclear eﬀec-
tive interactions (or modern Energy Density Functional
theories). These terms are linked to the symmetry en-
ergy contribution in the nuclear Equation of State (EoS),
a concept which is widely employed in the description of
heavy ion collisions [26–28] and also in astrophysics, as
far as the modelization of supernova explosion and neu-
tron stars is concerned [29–31].

The aim of the present paper is therefore to investi-
gate the dipole response of neutron-rich nuclei, by solv-
ing the semi-classical Vlasov equation.
In the past,
studies based on semi-classical approaches, such as the
Goldhaber-Teller (GT) [32] or the Steinwedel-Jensen (SJ)
[33] models, have given an important contribution to the
understanding of the main features of giant resonances
and of their link to important nuclear properties, such as
compressibility and symmetry energy. In particular, the
Vlasov equation has already been shown to describe rea-
sonably well some relevant properties of diﬀerent collec-
tive excitations of nuclei [34–36]. It is clear that, within
such a semi-classical description, shell eﬀects, certainly

important in shaping the ﬁne structure of the dipole re-
sponse [23], are absent. However, the genuine collective
features of the nuclear excitations should naturally come
out from this analysis.

Here, for the mean-ﬁeld representation, we will employ
new eﬀective interactions, of the Skyrme type - the SAMi-
J interactions - which have been especially devised to
improve the description of spin-isospin properties of nu-
clei [37]. We will focus on the mixed isoscalar/isovector
character of the collective excitations in neutron-rich nu-
clei, in some analogy with features already discussed in
the context of inﬁnite nuclear matter, where the degree
of mixing is observed to increase with the isospin asym-
metry, tuned by the density dependence of the symme-
try energy [26, 27]. Then, we show that the relative
isoscalar/isovector weight of the diﬀerent modes, as ob-
served in the nuclear response, is determined by their in-
trinsic structure, in terms of isoscalar (IS) and isovector
(IV) components, as well as by the type of initial pertur-
bation considered. As a result, within our framework, the
low-lying strength arising in the IV dipole response essen-
tially reﬂects the partial isovector character of collective
modes which are mostly isoscalar-like, in agreement with
previous semi-classical and RPA studies [23, 38].

An important goal of our investigation is to get a
deeper insight into the link between the nuclear response
and the properties of the underlying eﬀective interac-
tion. In particular, considering SAMi-J parametrizations
which mostly diﬀer in the isovector channel, we will ex-
plore the relation between the mixed isoscalar/isovector
structure of the dipole collective modes and the density
dependence of the symmetry energy. We notice that the
latter quantity also aﬀects the size of the neutron skin.
Thus our analysis also aims at elucidating the possible
connection between the strength observed, for selected
nuclei, in the PDR region and the corresponding neutron
skin extension [39].

The paper is organized as follows: in Section II we out-
line the theoretical framework and the main ingredients
associated with the Vlasov equation and its numerical so-
lution. The diﬀerent Skyrme parametrizations employed
in our study are presented. The results concerning the
isoscalar and isovector dipole response, for selected nu-
clei in three diﬀerent mass regions are discussed in Sec-
tion III.A. Two diﬀerent kinds of initial perturbation,
corresponding to standard isoscalar and isovector excita-
tions, are considered. The corresponding transition den-
sities are presented in Section III.B. Finally, in Section
IV, conclusions and perspectives are drawn.

II. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

The Vlasov equation, which describes the time evolu-
tion of the one-body distribution function in phase space,
represents the semi-classical limit of Time-Dependent
Hartree-Fock (TDHF) and, for small-oscillations, of the
RPA equations. While the model is unable to account

2

for eﬀects associated with the shell structure, this self-
consistent approach is suitable to describe robust quan-
tum modes, of zero-sound type, in both nuclear matter
and ﬁnite nuclei [26, 35, 38, 40]. One has essentially
to solve the two coupled Vlasov kinetic equations for
the neutron and proton distribution functions fq(r, p, t),
with q = n, p [26]:

∂fq
∂t

∂ǫq
∂p

= 0.

(1)

In the equations above, ǫq represents the single particle
energy, which can be deduced from the energy density,
E . Considering a standard Skyrme interaction, the lat-
ter is expressed in terms of the isoscalar, ρ = ρn + ρp,
and isovector, ρ3 = ρn − ρp, densities and kinetic energy
densities (τ = τn + τp, τ3 = τn − τp) as [41]:

(2)

where m is the nucleon mass and the coeﬃcients C..,
D.. are combinations of traditional Skyrme parameters.
In particular, the terms with coeﬃcients Cef f and Def f
are the momentum dependent contributions to the nu-
clear eﬀective interaction. The Coulomb interaction is
also considered in the calculations. We are mostly in-
terested in the eﬀects linked to the isovector terms,
thus we introduce the symmetry energy per nucleon,
Esym/A = C(ρ)I 2, where I = (N − Z)/A is the asym-
metry parameter and the coeﬃcient C(ρ) can be written
as a function of the Skyrme coeﬃcients (at temperature
T = 0):

with ǫF denoting the Fermi energy at density ρ.

In the following we will adopt the recently introduced
SAMi-J Skyrme eﬀective interactions [37]. The corre-
sponding parameters have been ﬁtted based on the SAMi
ﬁtting protocol [37]: binding energies and charge radii of
some doubly magic nuclei which allow the SAMi-J fam-
ily to predict a reasonable saturation density (ρ0 = 0.159
fm−3), energy (E/A(ρ = ρ0) = −15.9 MeV) and incom-
pressibility (K = 245 MeV) of symmetric nuclear mat-
ter; some selected spin-orbit splittings; the spin and spin-
isospin sensitive Landau Migdal parameters [42]; and, ﬁ-
nally, the neutron matter EoS of Ref.[43]. These features
allow the new SAMi interactions to give a reasonable
description of isospin as well as spin-isospin resonances,
keeping a good reproduction of well know empirical data
such as masses, radii and important nuclear excitations.
The main diﬀerence between SAMi and the SAMi-J fam-
ily is that SAMi-J has been produced by systematically
varying the value of J = C(ρ0) from 27 to 35 MeV, keep-
ing ﬁxed the optimal value of the incompressibility and
eﬀective mass predicted by SAMi and reﬁtting again the

parameters for each value of J. This produces a set of in-
teractions of similar quality on the isoscalar channel and
that, approximately, isolate the eﬀects of modifying the
isovector channel in the study of a given observable. In
our calculations, we employed, in particular, three SAMi-
J parametrizations: SAMi-J27, SAMi-J31 and SAMi-J35
[37]. Since, as mentioned above, the SAMi-J interactions
have been ﬁtted in order to also reproduce the main
features of ﬁnite nuclei, for the three parametrizations
the symmetry energy coeﬃcient gets the same value,
C(ρc) ≈ 22 MeV at ρc = 0.65ρ0, which can be taken
as the average density of medium-size nuclei. Thus the
curves representing the density dependence of C(ρ) cross
each other at ρ = ρc, i.e., below saturation density, see
Fig.1 (panel (b)). The corresponding values of symme-
try energy at saturation, together with the values of the

slope parameter L = 3 ρ0

are reported in Ta-

dC(ρ)

dρ (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ρ=ρ0

ble I. In the following we will also indicate the SAMi-J
interactions as momentum dependent (MD) interactions.
In order to make a connection with previous stud-
ies, we shall also consider simpliﬁed Skyrme interactions
where the momentum dependent terms are neglected
(Cef f = Def f = 0), corresponding to an incompressibil-
ity modulus equal to K = 200 MeV [39]. We will refer
to these interactions as momentum-independent (MI) in-
teractions.

As far as the symmetry energy is concerned, the
parametrizations considered allow for three diﬀerent
types of density dependence, associated with three dif-
ferent parametrizations of the potential part of the sym-
metry energy coeﬃcient, Cpot(ρ). For the asystiﬀ EoS,
Cpot(ρ) = 18ρ/ρ0 MeV. The asysoft case corresponds
to a SKM* Skyrme-like parametrization with Cpot(ρ) =
0.5ρ(482 − 1638ρ) MeV, associated with a small value of
the slope parameter L. Lastly, for the asysuperstiﬀ EoS,
Cpot(ρ) = 18 ρ
(ρ+ρ0) MeV, the symmetry term increases
ρ0
rapidly around saturation density, being characterized by
a large value of the slope parameter. The corresponding
values are listed in Table I. As one can see from Fig.1
(panel (a)), the three parametrizations of the symmetry
energy cross each other at ρ = ρ0 in this case.

2ρ

The integration of the transport equations is based on
the test-particle (t.p.) (or pseudo-particle) method [44],
with a number of 1500 t.p. per nucleon in all the cases,
ensuring in this way a good spanning of the phase space.
In order to determine the ground state conﬁguration of
the nuclei under study, one should ﬁnd the stationary so-
lution of Eq.(1). We adopt the following numerical proce-
dure: neutrons and protons are distributed inside spheres
of radii Rn and Rp, respectively. Accordingly, particle
momenta are initialized inside Fermi spheres associated
with the local neutron or proton densities. Then Rn and
Rp are tuned in order to minimize the corresponding total
energy, associated with the eﬀective interaction adopted
in the calculations. We note here that the test particle
method is able to reproduce accurately the equation of
state of nuclear matter and provide reliable results re-

3

garding the properties of nuclear surface [45] and ground
state energy for ﬁnite nuclei [39, 46].

From the one-body distribution functions one obtains

the local densities:

ρq(r, t) =

2

(2π)3 Z d3pfq(r, p, t),

(4)

as well as the average value of the radial distance r to
the power n:

n
hr
q i =

1

Nq Z d3r r

nρq(r, t).

(5)

In the above equation, Nn = N and Np = Z denote
neutron and proton number, respectively. As we will see,
these quantities are quite useful in the following analysis
(see Section III).

Because test particles are often associated with ﬁnite
width wave packets (we use triangular functions [47]),
some surface eﬀects are automatically included in the ini-
tialization procedure and in the dynamics, even though
explicit surface terms, as those contained in the eﬀec-
tive Skyrme interactions, are not considered. This im-
plies that, for the surface terms, one cannot simply use
the coeﬃcients associated with the SAMi-J parametriza-
tions.
Indeed we observe that a good reproduction of
the experimental values of the proton root mean square
radius and binding energy, for the nuclei selected in our
analysis, is obtained when taking Csurf = Dsurf = 0 in
our parametrizations. Thus this choice has been adopted
in the following.

We will concentrate our analysis on three mass regions,
considering the following neutron-rich nuclei: 68N i (N/Z
= 1.43), 132Sn (N/Z = 1.64), 208P b (N/Z = 1.54). The
corresponding values of binding energy, neutron and pro-
ton root mean square radii are reported in Tables II, III,
IV, for the SAMi-J interactions. In Fig.2, we show the
neutron and proton density proﬁles, obtained for the sys-
tem 132Sn, with the three SAMi-J parametrizations con-
sidered in our study. According to the procedure adopted
here to build the ground state conﬁguration, these values
are not expected to coincide with the results of Hartree-
Fock calculations, but they are actually quite close [48].
As expected, the neutron skin thickness increases with
the slope parameter L: this eﬀect is indeed related to
the derivative of the symmetry energy around saturation
density. When the symmetry energy decreases signiﬁ-
cantly below ρ0, as in the case of the asysuperstiﬀ EoS or
the SAMi-J35 interaction, it is energetically convenient
for the system to push the neutron excess towards the
nuclear surface.

The same trend is observed for the 68N i and 208P b
ground state conﬁguration (see Tables II, IV) and also for
the MI interactions [39]. However, it should be noticed
that, in the case of the SAMi-J interactions, the diﬀerent
value of the symmetry energy at saturation induces a
quite diﬀerent behavior of the neutron density also in
the bulk, see Fig.2.

A. Collective Dipole Response

We study the E1 (isoscalar and isovector) response
of nuclear systems, considering initial conditions deter-
mined by the instantaneous excitation Vext = ηkδ(t −
t0) ˆDk, at t = t0, along the z direction [40, 50]. Here
ˆDk is the isoscalar (k = S) or isovector (k = V) dipole

to the initial expectation value of the collective dipole

collective coordinate ˆDk, i.e., [ ˆDk, ˆΠk] = i [51].

Dipole oscillations and response functions can be in-
vestigated, within our semi-classical treatment, consider-
ing a gentle perturbation of the ground state conﬁgura-
tion of the nucleus under consideration and then looking
at its dynamical evolution, as given by Eq.(1). We fol-
low the dynamics of the system until tmax = 1800 fm/c,
thus being able to extract time oscillations of the dipole
moments. A ﬁltering procedure, as described in [52],
was applied in order to eliminate the artifacts result-
ing from a ﬁnite time domain analysis of the signal.
Thus a smooth cut-oﬀ function was introduced such that

As it is well known,

).
in symmetric nuclear matter
isoscalar and isovector modes are fully decoupled. How-
ever, in neutron-rich systems, neutrons and protons may
oscillate with diﬀerent amplitudes, thus inducing a cou-
pling of isoscalar and isovector excitations. One of the

main goals of our analysis is to get a deeper insight into
this eﬀect. Indeed it appears that considering an initial
isovector perturbation of the system, one also gets an
isoscalar response, and vice versa. This is illustrated in
Fig.3, where we represent dipole oscillations (left panels)
and corresponding strength, as a function of the excita-
tion energy E = ω (right panels) for the system 132Sn
and the SAMi-J31 interaction, obtained by considering
an initial IS perturbation with ηS = 0.5 MeV fm−2 (pan-
els from (a) to (d)) or an initial IV perturbation with
ηV = 25 MeV (panels from (e) to (h)).

One can observe that, when introducing an IS pertur-
bation at the initial time t0 (Fig.3, panels (a)-(b)), also
isovector-like modes are excited, as it is evidenced from
the analysis of the corresponding isovector dipole oscilla-
tions and associated strength (panels (c)-(d)). Similarly,
an initial IV perturbation (panels (e)-(f)) also generates
an isoscalar response (panels (g)-(h)).

In the isovector response (panel (f)) one can easily
recognize the main IV GDR peak, with EGDR ≈ 14
MeV. Some strength is also evidenced at lower energy
(mostly in the range between E1 = 9 MeV and E2 = 11
MeV), which could be associated with the PDR. These
low-energy modes contribute signiﬁcantly to the corre-
sponding isoscalar projection (panel (h)), now acquiring
a larger strength, comparable to that associated with
the robust GDR mode, thus manifesting their isoscalar-
like nature. A (negative) peak is seen at higher en-
ergy (around 29 MeV), which corresponds to the giant
isoscalar-like dipole mode (IS GDR) [23] which is also
excited, owing to its mixed character, by the initial per-
turbation.

When agitating the system with an initial isoscalar ex-
citation, essentially the same oscillation modes emerge,
with a larger strength for the isoscalar-like ones in this
case. Indeed, in the isoscalar response (panel (b)) two
main peaks, whose positions are quite close to the E1 and
E2 energies evidenced in panel (h), are observed in the

low energy region, together with some (smaller) strength
located around the IV GDR region (EGDR ≈ 14 MeV).
A quite large contribution appears also in the high en-
ergy region of the spectrum (E ≈ 29 MeV). Projecting
onto the isovector direction (panel (d)) the strength of
the IV GDR mode is enhanced, as expected according to
its isovector-like nature, becoming comparable to that of
the low-energy isoscalar-like modes excited by the initial
perturbation. On the other hand, the high energy mode
exhibits a quite small (negative) strength, pointing again
to its isoscalar-like character.

To summarize, we observe that the same energy modes,
which are actually the normal modes of the system and
are of mixed nature, appear at the same time in the
isoscalar and isovector responses of the system, but with
a diﬀerent weight, depending on their intrinsic structure
and on the initial perturbation type. In particular, the
low-energy modes, lying below the GDR peak, have pre-
dominant isoscalar nature, but they may also contribute
to the isovector response, in the PDR region.

We move now to investigate how the response of the
system depends on the eﬀective interaction adopted, in
the three mass regions considered in this work. Hereafter
we will only examine the isoscalar (isovector) response
connected to an initial isoscalar (isovector) perturbation.

In Fig.4 (a) we show, for 68N i, the strength function
corresponding to the IS dipole response as a function of
the excitation energy E. In Fig. 4(b), the same quantity
is shown but for the IV dipole response. In the case of
132Sn and 208P b, the strength functions for the dipole
response are depicted in Figs. 5(a) and 6(a) (IS) and in
Figs. 5(b) and 6(b) (IV), respectively. In all panels, the
predictions of the three selected SAMi-J interactions are
shown.

For 68N i and 132Sn, the isoscalar strength (panels
(a)) appears quite fragmented in the low-energy domain.
However one can recognize two main regions of impor-
tant contribution for all the interactions considered (see
in particular the SAMi-J35 results) and identify a smaller
peak centered at the energy of the IV GDR (originat-
ing from its mixed nature in neutron-rich systems, as
stressed above). It is worth noting that the observation
of two main low-energy peaks in the isoscalar response is
in agreement with the semi-classical studies of Ref.[38],
where isoscalar toroidal excitations are investigated. In
particular, in [38] it is shown that the lowest energy mode
is associated mostly with surface oscillations and, in the
case of neutron-rich systems, is responsible for the low-
lying strength observed in the isovector response (in the
PDR region). On the other hand, RPA calculations [23]
exhibit a more isolated peak in the low-energy region of
the IS strength function SS(E), but some contributions
appear also at higher energy, in a region around the do-
main of the IV GDR (for instance, around 14 MeV in the
132Sn case).

For the largest system considered, 208P b, our calcula-
tions show just one main peak, of signiﬁcant strength, in

the low-energy region.

The discrepancy with respect to RPA calculations may
be probably attributed to the lack of intrinsic gradient
terms of quantal nature in our approach and to the nu-
merical treatment of surface eﬀects [53]. It appears more
critical in smaller systems, where the relative importance
of surface to volume eﬀects increases.

In any case, the low-energy peaks of the IS response
appear connected to the low-lying strength observed in
the IV response (panels (b)), in the PDR region. Since
the diﬀerent peaks are quite close to each other, only one
main peak, resulting from two interfering contributions,
may appear in the PDR region of the IV response.

Let us concentrate now on the details of the isovector
response. In the 208P b case, the centroid energies of the

FIG. 4: (Color online) The strength functions versus excita-
tion energy for 68N i with SAMi-J27, SAMi-J31 and SAMi-
J35 interactions. Panel(a) is for the initial IS perturbation
and panel (b) is for the initial IV perturbation.

PDR as well as the energy peak of the isovector GDR pre-
dicted by the employed interactions (E=8-10 MeV and
E=12-13 MeV, respectively) are close to the experimen-
tal data (E=7.37 MeV within a window of 6 - 8 MeV [54]
and E=13.43 MeV with a total width of 2.42 MeV [55],
respectively). The predictions of the three SAMi-J inter-
actions for the PDR, for 132Sn (E= 9.0-11.0 MeV) and for
68N i (E= 11.5 - 13.5 MeV), are also close, but still a little
higher than the measured data (E= 9.1 - 10.5 MeV for
132Sn [5] and E=11 MeV with an energy width estimated
to be less than 1 MeV for 68N i [10, 56]). The overestima-
tion of the PDR energy in our calculations may still be
connected to the semi-classical treatment of surface ef-
fects, as already stressed above. Indeed the PDR region
is essentially populated by low-lying isoscalar-like oscil-
lations, whose energy is signiﬁcantly aﬀected by surface

eﬀects. The results can be probably improved by a ﬁne
tuning of the coeﬃcients Csurf and Dsurf in the Skyrme
parametrizations.

Qualitatively, in the three nuclei it appears that the
larger the value of L, the higher the diﬀerent peaks aris-
ing in the low-energy region of the IV dipole response
(see Figs. 4 - 6, panels (b)). Moreover, as it clearly
appears from panels (a), the strength of the lowest en-
ergy mode in the IS response increases (except for 208P b)
when increasing the slope L of the parametrization con-
sidered, also reﬂecting into a larger isovector strength in
the PDR region (panels (b)). We note that, on the basis
of nuclear matter calculations [26], we expect a larger de-
gree of mixing between isoscalar and isovector modes, in
neutron-rich systems, for symmetry energy parametriza-
tions with larger slope L. Moreover, in this case, one also
obtains a more extended neutron skin (see Fig.2), thus
surface and isospin eﬀects are both enhanced.

Finally, we observe for all nuclei that the IV projec-

tion of the PDR is an order of magnitude smaller than
the IV GDR, but its isoscalar counterpart is of the same
order of magnitude as the corresponding IS GDR [23].
We conclude that the PDR is mostly an isoscalar low-
energy mode, involving also nucleons which belong to the
nuclear surface. Owing to the charge asymmetry of the
systems considered, this mode also manifests an isovector
character, especially in the case of the stiﬀer interactions,
which predict a larger asymmetry in the surface (neutron
skin), see the density proﬁle in Fig.2.

Actually the IV response also exhibits other interest-
ing features, which can be better discussed by compar-
ing with the results obtained with the MI Skyrme in-
teractions, displayed in Fig.7 for 132Sn. Concerning the
main IV GDR, our calculations indicate that its excita-
tion energy is mainly aﬀected by the value of the symme-
try energy at the density ρc = 0.65 ρ0, where the three
SAMi-J interactions cross each other (see Fig.1), which
can be taken as the average density of medium-heavy

nuclei. Indeed, the centroid of the IV GDR peak does
not evolve much with the parametrization considered, in
the SAMi-J case. The largest shift is observed for the
smallest system, 68N i, indicating that the GDR centroid
is actually sensitive to the value of the symmetry en-
ergy at a density below ρc in this case. On the other
hand, for the MI parametrizations, which cross at nor-
mal density (see Fig.1), thus having a smaller value of the
symmetry energy below ρ0 in the stiﬀer case, the energy
centroid is clearly more sensitive to the parametrization
employed, see Fig.7, being smaller in the asysuperstif f
case. We also stress that the GDR energy appears al-
ways underestimated by the MI interactions, whereas it
is close to the experimental observation when the SAMi-J
interactions are considered. In particular, the SAMi-J31
and the asystiﬀ parametrizations are characterized by a
quite similar behavior of the symmetry energy (compare
the two panels of Fig.1), nevertheless the results of the

dipole response are diﬀerent in the two cases. This high-
lights the role of momentum dependent eﬀects in shaping
the features of the nuclear response. One can also note
that the energy location of the PDR strength is much
less sensitive to the isovector channel of the interaction,
especially in the MI case.

In the isovector dipole response obtained with the
SAMi-J, we also observe a quite pronounced peak at
higher energy, with respect to the GDR, whose strength
decreases with the stiﬀness of the interaction, in agree-
ment with RPA calculations [23]. This peak is less pro-
nounced in the MI case.

B. Transition densities

In addition to the investigation of the dipole response
presented above, the analysis of the transition densities
associated with the diﬀerent excitation modes of the sys-
tem is very instructive since it delivers important infor-
mation about the spatial structure related to the dynam-
ics of every excitation.

To undertake this analysis, we need to evaluate the
local spatial density as a function of time.
In order
to reduce numerical ﬂuctuations, we take into account
the cylindrical symmetry of the initial perturbation and,
averaging over the azimuthal φ angle, we extract the
density ρq(r, cos θ, t) and the corresponding ﬂuctuation
δρq(r, cos θ, t) = ρq(r, cos θ, t) − ρq(r, t0), where cos θ =
z/r and ρq(r, t0) denotes the ground state density proﬁle
which only depends on r.

As suggested in Ref.[38], assuming that the ampli-
tude of the oscillation is weak (linear response regime),
the spherical symmetry of the ground state and the
dipole form of the excitation operator imply that the
transition density can be written, at each time, as:
δρq(r, cos θ, t) = δρq(r, t) cos θ. Then one can ﬁnally ex-
tract the transition density just as a function of the ra-
dial distance r, by averaging, over cos θ, the quantity
δρq(r, t) = δρq(r, cos θ, t)/ cos θ.

It is clear that the delta function perturbation, Vext,
at t = t0, agitates simultaneously all modes which can
be excited by the operator ˆDk. Thus the corresponding
density oscillations observed along the dynamical evolu-
tion will appear as the result of the combination of the
diﬀerent excitation modes. In order to pin down the con-
tribution of a given mode to the density oscillations, one
can consider the energy E associated, for instance, with a
peak in the strength function and compute the transition
density as the Fourier transform of δρq(r, t):

δρq(r, E) ∝ Z ∞

.

(10)

In practice, since the simulation runs only to tmax = 1800
fm/c, the sine function is multiplied by a damping factor,
as in the strength function Sk(E).

To further analyze the isoscalar or isovector charac-
ter of each excitation mode, we calculate neutron and

metric matter, neutrons and protons oscillate with ex-
actly equal (isoscalar) or opposite (isovector) amplitudes.
In neutron-rich systems, the picture is more complex,
however one can still identify isoscalar-like modes, when
the two nuclear species oscillate in phase, and isovector-
like modes, with neutrons and protons oscillating out of
phase. Apart from this information, connected to the
mixed character of each mode, the overall spatial struc-
ture of the transition densities tells us which part of the

In Figs.8-10, we represent the transition density associ-
ated with the low energy peaks observed in the isoscalar
response, for the three systems considered and the three
SAMi-J parametrizations adopted. As discussed above,
owing to its mixed character, this mode also contributes
to the isovector response, in the PDR region. The corre-
sponding transition density could also be extracted from
the isovector response, however, since the IV strength is
quite small, numerical ﬂuctuations would spoil the signal
[57].

ing generally larger amplitude than protons. The nu-
clear surface is signiﬁcantly involved in these oscillations.
Moreover, when considering interactions with increasing
slope L (from SAMi-J27 to SAMi-J35), one can see that
neutron oscillations become larger, with respect to pro-
ton oscillations, especially in the surface region, whereas
the opposite seems to hold for the interior of the sys-
tem. This can be explained by the fact that, for in-
creasing L, the system asymmetry is more pushed to-
wards the surface, corresponding to the development of
the neutron skin, whereas the internal part of the sys-
tem becomes more symmetric. As one can see from

Fig.11, where the surface region of the transition density
is better evidenced, surface eﬀects are less pronounced
in the 208P b case. However, a signiﬁcant contribution
to the dipole strength may also come from the inter-
mediate spatial region, where the transition densities
are positive. Indeed, according to the deﬁnition of the
IV dipole moment, Eq.(7), the dipole strength increases
when δρn/δρp > N/Z, for negative transition densities,
or when δρn/δρp < N/Z, for positive transition densi-
ties. Both conditions are better satisﬁed, in the surface
and in the intermediate region respectively, with increas-
ing L. This determines an overall increase of the mixed
character of the mode, mainly determined by the surface
behavior, but also by the internal part of the system,
leading to a larger strength observed in the isovector re-
sponse, see Figs.4-6.

We also extend our analysis to the other modes giving
a relevant contribution to the isoscalar and the isovector
responses. This is illustrated in Figs.12-13, for the system
132Sn, in the case of the SAMi-J31 interaction, for IS and
IV excitations, respectively.

As it is observed from the analysis of the isoscalar
response (Fig.5), there exists a second mode, around
E2 = 11 MeV, which gives an important contribution in
the low-energy region. This excitation also contributes
to the isovector response, as already stressed in Section
III.A. Looking at the associated transition density, gen-
erated by an IS perturbation of the system (Fig.12, panel
(a)),
it appears that neutrons and protons essentially
move in phase, but still with diﬀerent amplitudes. Thus
the oscillation has a mixed character and this is why it
presents some strength in the isovector response. Now
the interior of the system is more involved in the oscil-
lation, though the surface is still aﬀected.
It is worth
noting that, also for this transition density, the asymme-
try increases, with L, at the surface and diminishes in
the internal part.

We observe that, when this energy region is excited
from the IV operator (Fig.13, panel (a)), though the
structure of the mode keeps similar, the diﬀerence be-
tween neutrons and protons becomes more pronounced.
This eﬀect could be due to the inﬂuence of the strong
isovector oscillations associated with the IV GDR region,
whose contribution may extend to the considered energy.
Indeed, it should be noted that even if the energy E
corresponds to a peak in Sk(E), the transition densities
obtained with the method employed here may still con-
tain contributions from other modes if those have a width
which makes their spectrum extend to the energy E [38].
The highest energy isoscalar mode, that should be
associated with the isoscalar giant dipole compression
mode, corresponds to transition densities which af-
fect signiﬁcantly the interior of the system (Figs.12-13,
panel(d)) and its features do not depend much on the
type of initial perturbation. Moreover it appears of quite
robust isoscalar nature, with a small isoscalar/isovector
mixing, especially at the surface.

It is also interesting to look at the modes which are

11

isovector-like.
In this case neutrons and protons os-
cillate mostly out of phase, with protons having larger
amplitude. The transition densities extracted from the
isoscalar or from the isovector responses exhibit similar
features, compare panels (b) and (c) in Figs.12-13.
It
appears that the main IV GDR mode (panels (b)) cor-
responds essentially to one oscillation, with a maximum
close to the nuclear surface. This result is compatible
with GT picture of neutron and proton spheres oscillat-
ing against each other. On the other hand, the higher
energy peak, E ≈ 16.5 MeV (panels (c)), corresponds to
a kind of double oscillation, which is typical of SJ modes,
i.e. volume oscillations, involving also the internal part
of the system.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this work we have addressed some of the open ques-
tions concerning the nature of the low-lying IV dipole
strength experimentally observed in neutron-rich nuclei
[13]. By performing a systematic investigation over three
mass regions and employing eﬀective interactions which
diﬀer in the isovector channel, interesting features of the
E1 nuclear response were evidenced. An essential point
of our analysis is the examination of both IS and IV
response of the systems under study. Within our mi-
croscopic transport approach, a low-energy dipole col-
lective mode occurs in the IV response of all investi-
gated systems. The inspection of the IS response in the
same energy region reveals that the corresponding ex-
citations are essentially isoscalar-like, i.e., neutrons and
protons oscillate in phase but with diﬀerent amplitude.
This mechanism induces a ﬁnite, though small, isovec-
tor dipole moment oscillation, which is indeed revealed
in the IV strength. These results are in agreement with
the conclusions drawn from previous semi-classical inves-
tigations [38] or from RPA studies [23, 58]. It is worth
noticing that our analysis also indicates that, in neutron-
rich systems, the modes which are mostly isovector (such
as the IV GDR) also have a mixed character, thus con-
tributing to the IS strength. Moreover, the mixing of
isoscalar and isovector excitations in neutron-rich sys-
tems has been widely discussed in the context of inﬁnite
nuclear matter [26].

We also investigate how these features depend on the
properties of the eﬀective interaction considered and, in
particular, on the density behavior of the symmetry en-
ergy. We observe that the strength associated with the
collective pygmy dipole depends on the symmetry energy
slope. The analysis of the corresponding transition den-
sities reveals that this can be mostly related to the fact
that the neutron/proton asymmetry of the nucleus in-
creases, with L, at the surface, causing a larger mixing
of isoscalar and isovector modes, which, in turn, increases
the strength observed in the isovector response. One also
observes that the asymmetry decreases, with L, in the
internal part, also contributing to the dipole strength.

Thus the neutrons which belong to the skin play an es-
sential role in shaping the E1 response in the PDR region.
However, this does not correspond to the oversimpliﬁed
picture of the PDR, associated with the oscillations of
the excess neutrons against an inert isospin symmetric
core. Indeed, within our transport model, the dynamical
simulations show a more complex structure of the modes
contributing to the PDR [40], which also involves an ex-
citation of the core, in such a way that, inside the whole
nucleus, neutrons and protons move in phase but with
diﬀerent amplitudes. It is also worth noticing that these
low-lying isoscalar modes are observed also in symmet-
ric systems, without a corresponding IV strength in this
case [38].

By comparing with the results obtained with simpler
MI interactions, we observe that the SAMi-J Skyrme
parametrizations give a better reproduction of the cen-
troid energy of the IV GDR, quite close to the experi-
mental value. The results of our semi-classical approach
are also quite close to RPA calculations [23]. On the
other hand, the energy of the PDR looks overestimated,
probably due to the semi-classical treatment of surface
eﬀects in our approach.

We consider that the ﬁndings presented here, in partic-

12

ular the connection observed between the PDR strength,
the mixed isoscalar/isovector character of the nuclear ex-
citations and the nuclear density proﬁle, can be useful for
further, systematic experiments searching for this quite
elusive mode. In particular, the features emerging from
the analysis of the transition densities may help to select
the best experimental conditions to probe the nuclear re-
sponse in the PDR region. Moreover, a precise estimate
of the strength acquired by the PDR in the dipole re-
sponse can provide indications about the neutron skin
extension, helping to constrain yet unknown properties
of the nuclear eﬀective interaction, namely the density
dependence of the symmetry energy.
