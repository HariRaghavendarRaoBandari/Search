We introduce a general class of su(1|1) supersymmetric spin chains with long-range interactions
which includes as particular cases the su(1|1) Inozemtsev (elliptic) and Haldane–Shastry chains,
as well as the XX model. We show that this class of models can be fermionized with the help of
the algebraic properties of the su(1|1) permutation operator, and take advantage of this fact to
analyze their quantum criticality when a chemical potential term is present in the Hamiltonian. We
ﬁrst study the low energy excitations and the low temperature behavior of the free energy, which
coincides with that of a (1 + 1)-dimensional conformal ﬁeld theory (CFT) with central charge c = 1
when the chemical potential lies in the critical interval (0,E(π)), E(p) being the dispersion relation.
We also analyze the von Neumann and Rényi ground state entanglement entropies, showing that
they exhibit the logarithmic scaling with the size of the block of spins characteristic of a one-boson
(1 + 1)-dimensional CFT. Our results thus show that the models under study are quantum critical
when the chemical potential belongs to the critical interval, with central charge c = 1. From the
analysis of the fermion density at zero temperature, we also conclude that there is a quantum phase
transition at both ends of the critical interval. This is further conﬁrmed by the behavior of the
fermion density at ﬁnite temperature, which is studied analytically (at low temperature), as well as
numerically for the su(1|1) elliptic chain.

INTRODUCTION

Exactly solvable one-dimensional quantum models are
widely used as proving grounds for key ideas in condensed
matter physics and the theory of critical phenomena,
since their conceptual simplicity often makes it possi-
ble to derive exact analytical expressions for the relevant
physical quantities. Historically, most of the work in this
ﬁeld has been focused on systems with short-range inter-
actions, like the well-known Heisenberg and (quantum)
Ising chains. In the last few years, however, it has be-
come feasible to realize in the laboratory quantum spin
chains featuring various types of long-range interactions
through diﬀerent experiments involving, e.g., optical lat-
tices of ultracold Rydberg atoms and trapped ions, or
neutral atoms in optical cavities [1–5]. In particular, with
the help of hyperﬁne “clock” states of trapped 171Yb+
ions it is now possible to simulate quantum spin chains
in which the coupling hij between the i-th and j-th sites
is inversely proportional to a power α ∈ (0, 3) of their dis-
tance [1, 4]. An important model of this type is the inte-
grable Haldane–Shastry (HS) chain [6, 7], whose sites are
the equispaced points zk = e2πik/N (1 (cid:54) k (cid:54) N) on the
unit circle with a coupling proportional to |zi − zj|−2. In
fact, this chain is a limiting case of a more general model

due to Inozemtsev, in which the coupling hij is an elliptic
function of the diﬀerence i − j with real period N [8].

Although the particles in the original HS chain carried
spin 1/2, the model was shortly generalized to su(m) spin
without losing its remarkable integrability properties [9].
As a matter of fact, the su(m|n) supersymmetric version
of the HS chain, originally introduced by Haldane [10],
has also been studied in the literature [11, 12]. Of partic-
ular interest is the su(m|1) HS chain (with m > 1), since
it is essentially equivalent to an su(m) supersymmetric
t-J model [13–15] with exchange and transfer energies
proportional to |zi − zj|−2. This chain, ﬁrst introduced
by Kuramoto and Yokoyama in the su(2) case [16], is an
exactly solvable model which provides one of the simplest
realizations of spin-charge separation.

In this work we introduce a wide class of su(1|1) super-
symmetric spin chains with general translation-invariant
couplings hij > 0 and a chemical potential term. For
zero chemical potential, these models include in particu-
lar the supersymmetric elliptic chain studied in Ref. [17]
and its two limiting cases, namely the su(1|1) HS chain
and the XX model. The class of models under study are
technically simpler than their su(m|1) counterparts, es-
sentially due to the fact that they can be transformed
into a system of free spinless fermions in a straightfor-
ward way. However, they still exhibit a suﬃciently rich
structure which makes it possible to examine a number of
key properties in the theory of quantum critical systems
in an analytic fashion.

More precisely, our main objective is to study whether
the models under consideration are quantum critical for
suitable values of the chemical potential, and to de-

termine their corresponding central charge. As is well
known, a characteristic feature of (1 + 1)-dimensional
CFTs is the fact that at low temperature T their free
energy per unit length is approximately given (in appro-
priate units) by f0 − πcT 2/(6v), where f0 is a constant
and v is the eﬀective speed of “sound” [18, 19]. Since
the low temperature behavior of f is determined by the
low-lying states of the theory, this should also be the case
for any one-dimensional quantum system whose low en-
ergy spectrum is described by a (1+1)-dimensional CFT.
In particular, the determination of the low temperature
behavior of the free energy of a one-dimensional critical
model provides an eﬃcient way of determining the cen-
tral charge of its underlying CFT. In this way we have
been able to show that if the dispersion relation E(p)
is monotonic in the range [0, π] the models under study
are critical when the chemical potential λ belongs to the
open interval (0,E(π)), with central charge c = 1. As
further conﬁrmation of this result, we have studied the
ground state entanglement entropy, i.e., the entropy of
the reduced density matrix of a block of L consecutive
spins when the whole chain is in its ground state. Indeed,
it is well known that in a (1 + 1)-dimensional CFT the
Rényi and von Neumann entanglement entropies scale
as (c/6)(1+1/q) log L and (c/3) log L, respectively, where
c is the central charge and q is the Rényi parameter [20–
22]. Thus the entanglement entropy of a quantum critical
one-dimensional system should be proportional to log L
for L (cid:29) 1, where the proportionality constant ﬁxes the
central charge of the underlying CFT. Again, we have
veriﬁed that when the chemical potential belongs to the
open critical interval (0,E(π)) the entanglement entropy
of the models under consideration scales as that of a
(1 + 1)-dimensional CFT with c = 1. We have also ex-
amined the behavior of the entanglement entropy and
the zero-temperature fermion density as λ approaches the
endpoints of the critical interval, showing that it is con-
sistent with a quantum phase transition at both ends.
For the su(1|1) chain with elliptic interactions we have
studied numerically the fermion density at ﬁnite temper-
ature, ﬁnding that its behavior is far more complex when
the chemical potential lies in the critical interval. More
precisely, for suitable values of λ inside this interval the
fermion density is not a monotonic function of the tem-
perature, but can rather present up to two extrema.

The paper is organized as follows.

In Section II we
introduce the class of supersymmetric spin chains with
which this work is concerned, and recall how these mod-
els can be fermionized using the algebraic properties of
the su(1|1) permutation operator. In Section III we ana-
lyze the thermodynamics of the general su(1|1) chain (2)
when the dispersion relation is monotonic in the range
0 (cid:54) p (cid:54) π, showing that at low temperature it behaves
as a (1+1)-dimensional CFT with c = 1. In Section IV we
outline the computation of the von Neumann and Rényi
ground state entanglement entropies of the latter models
in terms of the eigenvalues of the ground state correlation
matrix. Section V is devoted to deriving asymptotic for-

2

mulas for these entropies, both when the size of the block
of spins tends to inﬁnity and when the chemical poten-
tial approaches the endpoints of the critical interval. In
Section VI we perform a numerical study of the fermion
density of the elliptic su(1|1) chain at ﬁnite temperature,
and determine analytically its low temperature behav-
ior for arbitrary interactions. Finally, in Section VII we
summarize our conclusions and discuss some future de-
velopments suggested by the present work.

Sij| . . . , si, . . . , sj, . . .i = (−1)n| . . . , sj, . . . , si, . . .i , (3)
where n = si = sj if si = sj while for si 6= sj n equals
the number of fermions at the sites i + 1, . . . , j − 1. Note
that Sij is invariant under the supersymmetry transfor-
i<j hN(i− j)(1− Sij)
in H is su(1|1) supersymmetric, while the last term λNf,
i.e, the chemical potential of the fermions, transforms
into λ(N − Nf) due to the constraints (1). Further-
more, we shall exclusively be concerned in this paper
with closed (i.e., periodic) chains, for which hN(x) =
hN(N − x). It is customary to extend the function hN
to the whole real line as an N-periodic function, so that
hN(x) = hN(−x) = hN(x + N) (cid:62) 0 ,
(4)
It was shown in Ref. [17] that any chain of the form (2)
can be recast into a model of spinless hopping fermions by
identifying the boson state |0i with the fermion vacuum.

The chain sites can now be either empty (i.e., in the
state |0i) or occupied by a fermion (in the state |1i), and
thus the Hilbert space is the whole 2N-dimensional Fock
space built acting on the vacuum |0, . . . , 0i with the op-

hopping amplitude between the i-th and j-th sites given
by hN(i − j) and chemical potential λ. The translation
invariance of this model (encoded in the periodicity of the
function h) suggests introducing the Fourier-transformed

tum 2πl/N, i.e.,

εN(l) = E(2πl/N) ,

0 (cid:54) l (cid:54) N − 1 ,

where the dispersion relation E is a smooth function de-
ﬁned in the interval [0, 2π]. It easily follows from Eq. (8)
that if such a function E exists it is necessarily unique,
and that E(p) = E(2π − p). An important type of inter-
action hN(x) satisfying the above requirement is given

In particular, we see that in this case the dispersion re-
lation is a pure 2π-periodic [27] function, independent of
the number of particles N. Taking the α → 0+ and α →
∞ limits in the above equation for E(p) one recovers the
well-known dispersion relations of the XX model [28] and
the su(1|1) Haldane–Shastry chain, namely
EXX(p) = 2(1 − cos p),

EHS(p) = 1

III. CRITICALITY AND THERMODYNAMICS

In this section we shall exploit the equivalence of
the su(1|1) supersymmetric chain (2) to the free fermion
model (5) to analyze the critical behavior of this chain as
a function of the chemical potential λ. To this end, we
ﬁrst need to determine the ground state of the model (5),
which is straightforward from Eq. (7). Indeed, it is ob-
vious from the latter equation that the modes excited
in the ground state are precisely those whose momenta
p = 2πl/N satisfy the condition λ > E(p) , so that
the ground state is nondegenerate. Strictly speaking,
this is only true if we assume that E(2πl/N) 6= λ for
l = 0, . . . , N − 1.
Indeed, if E(2πl/N) = λ the mode
with momentum 2πl/N (and 2π(N − l)/N,
if l > 0
and l 6= N/2) can be either present or absent in the
ground state, which is therefore degenerate. Since we
shall be exclusively concerned with the thermodynamic
limit N → ∞,
implicitly as-
sume without loss of generality that E(2πl/N) 6= λ for
0 (cid:54) l (cid:54) N − 1.

from now on we shall

We shall also assume in what follows that the dis-
persion relation has a positive derivative in the inter-
val (0, π), so that it is monotonically increasing in the
latter interval and reaches its maximum at p = π. This
is “generically” true, and it certainly holds for the disper-
sion relation (10) of the elliptic interaction (9) —and, in
particular, for the XX model and the su(1|1) Haldane–
Shastry chains. If this is the case, it is straightforward
to show that the model is gapless for λ ∈ [0,E(π)].
Indeed, ﬁrst of all it is clear that the system is gapped
for λ < 0 or λ > E(π). For instance, for λ < 0 the
†
0|0, . . . , 0i and the
gap between the ﬁrst excited state c
ground state is ∆E = |λ| > 0, which remains positive as
N → ∞. Similarly, when λ > E(π) the gap is approxi-
mately equal to ∆E = λ−E(π) > 0 independently of N.
Suppose, on the other hand, that 0 (cid:54) λ (cid:54) E(π), and let
l0 be the root of the equation E(2πl0/N) = λ in the inter-
val [0, N/2], which exists and is unique on account of the
monotonicity of E in the interval [0, π]. The modes ex-
cited in the ground state are now those with 0 (cid:54) l (cid:54) bl0c
and N −bl0c (cid:54) l (cid:54) N − 1, where bl0c denotes the integer
part of l0 (cf. Fig. 1). Thus if 0 (cid:54) λ (cid:54) E(π) the gap be-
tween the ﬁrst excited state and the ground state, given

4

FIG. 1. Dispersion relation E(2πl/N) as a function of the
mode number l = 0, . . . , N − 1 (the range of modes excited
in the ground state for the given λ has been represented by a
thick red line).

by

∆E = min(cid:0)λ − E(2πbl0c/N),E(2π(bl0c + 1)/N) − λ(cid:1),

is O(1/N), since λ = E(2πl0/N). Thus ∆E tends to zero
as N → ∞ and the system is gapless, as claimed. (In fact,
when l0 is an integer the modes with l = l0 or l = N − l0
may or may not be present in the ground state, but this
does not aﬀect the ground state energy and therefore the
foregoing argument.)
We shall next show that when the chemical poten-
tial λ belongs to the open interval (0,E(π)) the su(1|1)
chain (2) is indeed critical, or, more precisely, that at
low energies its spectrum is that of a (1 + 1)-dimensional
CFT with one free boson. To begin with, we note that
when 0 < λ < E(π) the low energy excitations of the
chain (2) are linear in the excitation momentum. Indeed,
let

p0 = 2πl0/N ≡ E−1(λ) ∈ (0, π) ,

(12)
denote the Fermi momentum, where E−1 is the inverse
function of the restriction of the dispersion relation to the
interval [0, π]. Adding a fermion with momentum p0+∆p
(or, equivalently, 2π− p0 −∆p), with 0 < ∆p (cid:28) 1, to the
ground state increases the energy by E(p0 + ∆p) − λ =
E(p0+∆p)−E(p0) ’ E0(p0)∆p. The same excess energy is
approximately obtained when removing from the ground
state a fermion with momentum p0 − ∆p (or 2π − p0 +
∆p). Thus for low excitation momenta we have ∆E ’
E0(p0)∆p, as in a (1 + 1)-dimensional CFT with speed of
“sound” v = E0(p0).
The simple argument outlined above, based on lineariz-
ing the dispersion relation near the Fermi momentum p0
(or 2π − p0) —the only region in momentum space rel-
evant at low excitation energies— does not provide any
information on the central charge of the underlying CFT.
A more precise way of establishing the equivalence at
low energies of the su(1|1) spin chain (2) with a (1 + 1)-
dimensional CFT, and in particular of determining its
central charge, is based on the analysis of the chain’s free

energy. Indeed, as mentioned in the Introduction, at low
temperatures the free energy per unit length of a (1+1)-
dimensional CFT is given (in natural units  = kB = 1)
by

f(T) ’ f0 − πcT 2
6v

,

(13)

where f0 = f(0) is a constant, c is the central charge and
v is the eﬀective speed of sound. On the other hand, by
Eq. (7) the free energy of the spin chain (2) is simply
given by

F(T) = −T log Z = −T

N−1X

where Zl = 1 + e−β(E(2πl/N)−λ) (with β ≡ 1/T) is the

E(2π − p) we obtain the closed formula

In order to determine the low temperature behavior

which coincides with Eq. (13) with c = 1. This shows
that the spin chain (2) is indeed critical for 0 < λ < E(π),
with central charge c = 1.

points λ = 0,E(π) can be similarly investigated. Indeed,
suppose to begin with that λ = 0. In this case f(T) =
f2(T), where f2 is as in Eq. (17) with p0 = 0, so that
performing the change of variable x = βE(p) we obtain

f(T) = − T 2

The dispersion relation can be expanded around p = 0 as
E(p) = (p/a)κ + O(pκ+1), where κ (cid:62) 1 denotes the order
of the lowest nonvanishing derivative of E at the origin
(generically, therefore, κ = 1) and

(23)

We thus see that for λ = 0 the chain (2) cannot be critical
unless κ = 1, i.e., E0(0) 6= 0. Moreover, for κ = 1 we
have a = 1/v, and therefore
f(T) = − πT 2
12v

+ O(T 3) .

This shows that when λ = 0 and E0(0) 6= 0 the chain (2)
is still critical but has central charge c = 1/2, and its low
energy behavior is therefore described by a CFT with one
free fermion. For instance, for the elliptic interaction (9)
κ = 2 for 0 (cid:54) α < ∞, while κ = 1 for α = ∞.
In
particular, for 0 (cid:54) α < ∞ Eqs. (22)-(23) with κ = 2
reproduce the result in Ref. [17]. On the other hand, it is
well known that the su(1|1) Haldane–Shastry chain (i.e.,
the α = ∞ case) can indeed be described at low energies
by a (1 + 1)-dimensional CFT with one free fermion [12].
The analysis is totally analogous at the other endpoint
λ = E(π). Indeed, since now E(p)−E(π) < 0 for 0 (cid:54) p <
π we have f(T) = f0+f1(T), where f0 and f1 are respec-
tively given by Eqs. (15) and (16) with λ = E(π). Per-
forming the usual change of variable x = β[E(π) − E(p)]
we thus arrive at Eq. (18). Near p = π we have
E(π) − E(p) = [(π − p)/b]ν + O[(π − p)ν+1], where ν de-
notes the lowest nonvanishing derivative of the dispersion
relation at p = π and

(cid:20)

b ≡

− ν!

E(ν)(π)

.

(24)

Note that, by the symmetry E(p) = E(2π − p), ν is nec-
essarily even and E(ν)(π) < 0. Proceeding as before we
readily obtain Eqs. (22)-(23) with a and κ respectively
replaced by b and ν. In particular, since in this case ν (cid:62) 2
we see that at the endpoint λ = E(π) the model (2) is
not critical. In summary, our analysis indicates that the
latter model is critical for 0 < λ < E(π), and for λ = 0
when E0(0) 6= 0.

IV. GROUND STATE ENTANGLEMENT

ENTROPY

We shall study in this section the von Neumann en-
tanglement entropy S of the ground state of the su(1|1)
supersymmetric model (2), deﬁned as the von Neumann
entropy of the reduced density matrix ρL of a block of L
consecutive sites when the system is in its ground state.
In other words, if we denote by |ψi the ground state of
the chain (2) then ρL = trN−L |ψihψ|, where trN−L de-
notes the trace over the Hilbert space of the remaining
N − L sites, and the von Neumann entanglement entropy
is given by

S = − tr(ρL log ρL) .

6

More generally, we shall also consider the Rényi entropy

Sq = log tr(ρq
L)
1 − q

,

where q > 0 is a real parameter, which reduces to that of
von Neumann in the q → 1 limit. As pointed out in the
Introduction, the von Neumann and Rényi ground-state
entanglement entropies of a (1 + 1)-dimensional CFT
scale as rq log L when L → ∞, where the coeﬃcient rq is
related to the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic central
charges c and ¯c by rq = (1 + q−1)(c + ¯c)/12 (with q = 1
for the von Neumann entropy) . Since the su(1|1) super-
symmetric chain (2) is critical for 0 < λ < E(π), with
central charge c = ¯c = 1, it is to be expected that for
this model

Sq ’ 1

6 (1 + q−1) log L

in the limit L → ∞. In fact, we shall rigorously establish
this asymptotic formula in the next section (cf. Eq. (32)).
Before addressing the actual computation of the entan-
glement entropy of the su(1|1) chain (2), we note that the
result is the same for its “antiferromagnetic” version −H.
This is most easily proved by considering the equivalent
Hamiltonian (5), whose ground state entanglement en-
tropy is obviously unchanged if we reverse the roles of
the occupied and empty sites. In other words, the entan-
glement entropy is the same for the Hamiltonian (5) as
†
for its image under the replacement ai ↔ a
i. Using the
CAR and the even character of the interaction h, it is
immediate to show that the latter transformation maps
H into −H − N(λ + hN(0)), which establishes our claim.
First of all, it is clear that the ground state is not en-
tangled for λ outside the interval [0,E(π)]. Indeed, if (for
instance) λ < 0 the ground state is obviously the vac-
uum |0, . . . , 0i (i.e., the state with all sites occupied by
bosons for the original Hamiltonian (2)), since in this case
all the modes have positive energy E(2πl/N)− λ. In par-
ticular, the ground state is a product state (|0i⊗N), and
is therefore not entangled. The situation is completely
analogous for λ > E(π), since in this case E(2πl/N)−λ <
0 for all l and therefore all the modes are excited in the
†
l|ψi = 0 for all l = 0, . . . , N − 1,
ground state. Thus c
and therefore
k|ψi = 1√
†
Hence |ψi = |1, . . . , 1i = |1i⊗N (i.e., the state with all
sites occupied by fermions), which is again a product
state and therefore not entangled.
(This is also true
when λ = E(π) if N is odd.) From the previous con-
siderations it follows that the ground state entanglement
entropy of the model (2) vanishes for λ outside the inter-
val [0,E(π)] (and when λ = E(π), if N is odd), since in
these cases the ground state is a product state. For this
reason, in the rest of this section we shall suppose that λ
belongs to the open critical interval (0,E(π)).

We shall next ﬁnd a closed form expression for the
entanglement entropy of the su(1|1) chain (2) by apply-

the evaluation of the ground-state correlation matrix A

Let us now consider the analogous correlation matrix AL
for a block of L consecutive sites, which by translation
invariance we can take as the ﬁrst L ones. By the deﬁning

where µ1, . . . , µL ∈ [0, 1] are the eigenvalues of AL. We
then deﬁne the operators gk (1 (cid:54) k (cid:54) L) by gk =
kmam; note that gk, though certainly nonlocal,
acts on the Hilbert space of the ﬁrst L sites. The opera-
tors gk and their adjoints satisfy the CAR by the unitar-
ity of the matrix U, and their correlation matrix is given
by

†
hg
kgliL = µkδkl

on account of Eq. (26). As shown in Ref. [33], the latter
equation and Wick’s theorem for Gaussian states imply
that the correlation matrix factorizes as ρL = ⊗L
k=1k,
with

k = µkg

†
†
kgk + (1 − µk)gkg

The Hilbert space of the system is the tensor prod-
uct of the two-dimensional spaces spanned by the vec-

k|vik (1 (cid:54) k (cid:54) N), where gk|vik = 0. More-
tors |vik, g
over, from the CAR it easily follows that k is diagonal in
†
the basis {|vik, g
k|vik}, with respective eigenvalues 1−µk
and µk. Thus the von Neumann and Rényi entropies of k
are respectively equal to s(µk) and sq(µk), where

( s(x) = −x log x − (1 − x) log(1 − x) ,
sq(x) = (1 − q)−1 log(cid:2)xq + (1 − x)q(cid:3) .

By the additivity property of both of these entropies we
then have

Equations (27)-(28), which are exact for any L, make it
possible to evaluate numerically the ground state entan-
glement entropy of any supersymmetric su(1|1) chain of
the form (2) in polynomial time, since they are based
on the diagonalization of the L × L matrix with ele-
ments (25). From the latter equations it also follows that
the entropy of all of these models is a universal function
of the Fermi momentum p0, the diﬀerence between two
models being manifested only in the dependence of p0 on
the parameter λ through Eq. (12).

V. ASYMPTOTIC FORMULAS FOR THE

ENTANGLEMENT ENTROPY

where trL denotes the trace over the Hilbert space of the
ﬁrst L sites. Thus AL is just the submatrix of A consist-
ing of its ﬁrst L rows and columns. Following Ref. [30],
we now consider an alternative basis of fermionic opera-
tors whose correlation matrix is diagonal. More precisely,
let U = (umn)1(cid:54)m,n(cid:54)L be a unitary matrix diagonalizing
the Hermitian matrix AL, i.e., satisfying
U ALU† = diag(µ1, . . . , µL)

(26)

Equations (27)-(28) can be used to obtain approxi-
mate expressions for the entanglement entropy of the
general su(1|1) supersymmetric chain (2) in several in-
teresting regimes. To begin with, we shall investigate
the behavior of the entropy as λ approaches its extreme
critical values 0 and E(π). Suppose, in the ﬁrst place,
that λ tends to zero for ﬁxed L, so that the Fermi mo-
mentum p0 is much smaller than 1/L. In this case all the
matrix elements of the correlation matrix AL in Eq. (25)

are approximately equal to p0/π, so that AL = p0BL/π,
where BL is the L × L matrix with all matrix elements
equal to 1. Since the eigenvalues of BL are 0 (with mul-
tiplicity L − 1) and L, when Lp0 (cid:28) 1 the Rényi entan-
glement entropy is approximately given by

For the same reason, when Lp0 (cid:28) 1 the von Neumann
entropy can be approximated by

S ’ s(Lp0/π) ’ − Lp0

In particular, we see that both Sq and S are continu-
ous [34] at λ = 0. Similarly, suppose now that p0 is
close to its upper critical value E(π), so that p0 = π − ε
with ε (cid:28) 1/L. In this case we have

Amn ’ −(−1)m−n ε
π

,

m 6= n ,

while Ann = (π − ε)/π. Thus AL = 1I − (εCL)/π,
where CL is the L × L matrix with matrix ele-
ments Cmn = (−1)m−n.
It is easy to check that the
eigenvalues of CL are again 0 (with multiplicity L − 1)
and L, so that the previous asymptotic expressions for Sq
and S still hold with p0 replaced by π− p0. In particular,
this shows that the von Neumann and Rényi entangle-
ment entropies are both continuous [35] also at the upper
critical value λ = E(π). On the other hand, it is clear
that these entropies have a discontinuous ﬁrst derivative
(with respect to the chemical potential λ) at both end-
points λ = 0 and λ = E(π). For instance, for 0 < λ (cid:28) 1
we have

p0 ’ a λ1/κ ,

(29)

where κ is the order of the ﬁrst non-vanishing deriva-
tive of E at p = 0 and a is deﬁned in Eq. (19). Thus
dS/dλ diverges as λ1/κ−1| log λ| when λ → 0+. Simi-
larly, for 0 < q < 1 the derivative of the Rényi entropy
diverges as λq/κ−1 in this limit, while for q > 1 dSq/dλ
diverges as λ1/κ−1 for κ > 1 and tends to a non-zero
ﬁnite limit when κ = 1. The situation is similar at the
other endpoint λ = E(π), i.e.,

π − p0 ’ b(cid:0)E(π) − λ(cid:1)1/ν

,

(30)

with b deﬁned by Eq. (24), except that now ν (the or-
der of the lowest nonvanishing derivative of E at p = π)
is necessarily even and thus greater than or equal to 2.
Hence in all cases the derivatives of S and Sq diverge
as λ → E(π)−. The above analysis strongly suggests
that there is a quantum phase transition at λ = 0
and λ = E(π) between an ordered (non-entangled) and

8

a disordered (entangled) ground state, with the entan-
glement entropy as the order parameter. This conclu-
sion is conﬁrmed by the behavior of the zero-temperature
fermion density nf, which by translation invariance is
simply given by

in the critical
Indeed, by
Eqs. (29)-(30), near the two critical points λ = 0,E(π)
the fermion density respectively behaves as (a/π)λ1/κ
and 1 − (b/π)(E(π) − λ)1/ν. Since nf = 0 for λ < 0 and
nf = 1 for λ > E(π), this behavior is typical of a quan-
tum phase transition with exact exponents 1/κ and 1/ν
at the critical points λ = 0 and λ = E(π). For instance,
for the elliptic interaction (9) it is known [17] that ν = 2
and κ = 2 for 0 (cid:54) α < ∞, while κ = 1 for α = ∞ (i.e.,
for the su(1|1) HS chain). The parameters a and b can
also be exactly computed in this case, namely

the general elliptic su(1|1) model with interactions (9)
(with 0 < α < ∞) and dispersion relation (10),
it
is of course unfeasible to explicitly invert E to ob-
tain a closed-form expression for the Fermi momen-
tum p0 = E−1(λ). Note, however, that the graph of
the fermion density nf admits the simple parametriza-
tion (E(p), p/π), with 0 < p < π. In this way we have

0.00.51.00.00.20.40.60.81.0generated the plot in Fig. 2, where nf is represented as
a function of the normalized parameter λ/E(π), where
E(π) = 2 sinh2(π/α)[e1 −(2η1/π)], for several values of α
in the range [0, 50] and for α = ∞. The fermion density
can be easily computed in closed form for the limiting
cases α = 0 and α = ∞, i.e., for the XX model and
the su(1|1) Haldane–Shastry chain, due to the simple
form of their dispersion relations. Indeed, from Eq. (11)
we immediately obtain

respectively for 0 < λ < 4 and 0 < λ < π2/2. As ex-
pected, the ﬁrst of these formulas agrees with the result
in Ref. [33], taking into account that our parameter λ
is related to the parameter h in the latter reference by
h = 2−λ. On the other hand, the formula for the su(1|1)
HS chain is, to the best of our knowledge, new.

It is also of interest to determine the asymptotic behav-
ior of the von Neumann and Rényi entropies for 0 < λ <
E(π) ﬁxed and L (cid:29) 1. To this end, we note that Eq. (25)
implies that Amn is a function of m − n only, and hence
the correlation matrix AL is a Toeplitz matrix. This fact
can be exploited to ﬁnd a simple asymptotic formula for
the von Neumann and Rényi entanglement entropies in
the L → ∞ limit, as shown in Ref. [33] for the XX model.
The formula in the latter reference, which is based on
a particular case of the general Fisher–Hartwig conjec-
ture [36] proved by E. Basor in 1979 [37], is also valid for
a general model of the form (2) provided only that we
express the result in terms of the Fermi momentum p0.
Indeed, this formula relies only on Eq. (25) for the corre-
lation matrix which, as we have just seen, holds for the
model (2) with p0 = E−1(λ).
In this way one obtains
the following asymptotic formula for the Rényi entropy
in the limit L sin p0 (cid:29) 1:

Sq = q + 1
6q

log(L sin p0) + γ

(q)
1 + o(1) ,

(32)

(q)

while the corresponding formula for the von Neumann
entropy is obtained from the above by setting q = 1.
Here o(1) denotes a function of L and p0 which tends to
0 as L sin p0 → ∞, and γ
is a constant (independent
of L and p0) whose precise value, which can be found in
Ref. [33], will not be needed in what follows.
Equation (32) can be easily applied in the case of
the XX and su(1|1) Haldane–Shastry chains. Indeed, for
λ(1 − λ
the former of these models we have sin p0 =
4 ),
so that (32) agrees with the result in Ref. [33]. On
for the su(1|1) HS chain sin p0 =

L = 1000 and several values of the parameter α between 2

tively to the XX Heisenberg model (α = 0) and the su(1|1)

imation (32) to the von Neumann entropy of the ellip-
tic su(1|1) chain (2)-(9) for L = 1000 and several values of
the parameter α, including the limiting cases α = 0 (the
Heisenberg XX model) and α = ∞ (the su(1|1) Haldane–
Shastry chain). It is apparent that all of these plots are
qualitatively similar, although only in the case of the XX
model (α = 0) the graph of S is symmetric about the
midpoint λ = E(π)/2. More precisely, the maximum of
S at λ = E(π/2) is increasingly displaced towards the
right as α tends to inﬁnity, with E(π/2)/E(π) varying
continuously from 1/2 to 3/4 as α ranges from 0 to ∞.

VI. FERMION DENSITY AT FINITE

TEMPERATURE

In the previous sections we have seen that the su(1|1)
chain (2) is critical for 0 < λ < E(π), with central
charge c = 1. This is conﬁrmed by the asymptotic be-
havior of the ground state entanglement entropy when
the size of the block of spins considered tends to inﬁnity.
In this section we shall show that the fermion density at

also exhibits a qualitatively richer behavior when λ lies
in the critical interval (0,E(π)).

FIG. 4. Contour plot of the fermion density of the elliptic
su(1|1) chain (2)-(9) with α = 5 for 0 (cid:54) T (cid:54) 10 and −0.2 (cid:54)
λ/E(π) (cid:54) 1.2.

As a concrete example, we shall ﬁrst focus on
the su(1|1) elliptic chain (2)-(9). In Fig. 4 we present a
contour plot of nf for this model with α = 5 for T ∈ [0, 10]
and λ/E(π) ∈ [−0.2, 1.2], obtained by numerically evalu-
ating the integral in Eq. (34). For λ outside the critical
interval (0,E(π)), it is clear that nf is a monotonic func-
tion of T (increasing for λ (cid:54) 0, decreasing for λ (cid:62) E(π)),

On the other hand, it is apparent from Fig. 4 that there is
a range of values of λ in the interval (0,E(π)) for which
the fermion density is not a monotonic function of the
temperature. Remarkably, the su(1|1) elliptic chain ex-
hibits this interesting behavior for all values of the pa-
rameter α, including the limiting cases α = 0 and α = ∞.
More precisely, for each α there are three critical val-
ues λi (i = 1, 2, 3) of the chemical potential λ such that:
i) for 0 < λ (cid:54) λ1, the fermion density reaches an ab-
solute minimum at some positive temperature and then
increases monotonically towards its limiting value 1/2;
ii) for λ1 < λ < λ2, nf ﬁrst reaches a maximum at some
T > 0 and then a minimum, after which it tends mono-
tonically to 1/2; iii) for λ2 (cid:54) λ (cid:54) λ3, nf is monotonically
increasing, and iv) for λ3 < λ < E(π), the fermion density
attains an absolute maximum at some T > 0 and then

10

decreases monotonically towards 1/2. This is also true for
the limiting values α = 0 (XX model) and α = ∞ (su(1|1)
HS chain), for which λ1 = λ2 = λ3 = E(π)/2 = 2 and
λ1 = λ2 = 0, λ3 = 2E(π)/3 = π2/3, respectively. This
behavior is qualitatively apparent from Fig. 5, where we
have represented the implicit curve ∂nf /∂T = 0 vs. λ and
T for α = 0, 3, 5, 10,∞, and is also conﬁrmed by the plots
of nf vs. T for these values of α and λ = E(π)/3, 3E(π)/4
presented in Fig. 6.

FIG. 5. Plot of the implicit curve ∂nf/∂T = 0 for the elliptic
chain (2)-(9) and several values of the parameter α. The
red and blue dashed curves correspond respectively to the
XX model (α = 0) and the su(1|1) Haldane–Shastry chain
(α = ∞).

Although in general the integral in Eq. (34) cannot be
computed in closed form, its low temperature behavior
can be readily determined, as we shall now explain. To
begin with, when λ < 0 the exponent β(E(p) − λ) is
positive throughout the whole integration range, so that

The absence of a term linear in T in Eq. (36) is in
agreement with the low temperature behavior of nf ap-
parent from Fig. 6.
It is also interesting to observe
that the sign of the leading correction to the T = 0
value of nf is opposite to that of the second derivative
of E at the Fermi momentum p0. This behavior can
be understood by noting that the energy diﬀerence be-
tween adding a fermion with momentum p0 + ∆p (or
2π − p0 − ∆p) and removing a fermion with momentum
p0 − ∆p (or 2π − p0 + ∆p), with 0 < ∆p (cid:28) 1, is given by
E(p0 + ∆p) + E(p0 − ∆p) − 2E(p0) ’ E00(p0)∆p2. Thus
when E00(p0) < 0 the addition of a fermion is energeti-
cally more favorable than its removal for momenta close
to the Fermi momentum p0 (or to 2π − p0), and conse-
quently the fermion density should increase at suﬃciently
low temperatures. For instance, for the elliptic interac-
tion (9) with α (cid:62) 0 ﬁnite E00(p) is positive for p less than
a critical momentum (which depends on α) and negative
for larger momenta, while for the su(1|1) HS chain (i.e.,
for α = ∞) E00(p) = −1 is always negative. Again, these
facts are consistent with the behavior of nf observed in
Fig. 6.

VII. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

In this paper we introduce a general class of su(1|1)
supersymmetric spin chains with long-range interactions
generalizing the su(1|1) Haldane–Shastry and Inozemt-
sev (elliptic) chains, which can be fermionized using the
algebraic properties of the su(1|1) permutation operator.
We exploit this fact to study the critical behavior of this
class of models (with nonzero chemical potential λ) in
terms of their dispersion relation E(p). More precisely, we
show that they are gapless when the chemical potential
lies on the interval [0,E(π)], and that their ground state
is a product state unless λ belongs to this interval. We
prove that the models under study are actually critical
when 0 < λ < E(π) by verifying that their low energy ex-
citations are linear in the excitation momentum, and that
their free energy at low temperature exhibits the charac-
teristic quadratic behavior found in a (1+1)-dimensional
CFT with c = 1 [18, 19]. As further conﬁrmation of this
critical behavior, we ﬁnd an exact asymptotic formula
for the von Neumann and Rényi entanglement entropies
for the ground state, showing that when λ belongs to the
open interval (0,E(π)) they both scale as log L when the
size L of the block of spins considered tends to inﬁnity.
Moreover, in both cases the constant multiplying log L

12

is the same as for a (1 + 1)-dimensional CFT with cen-
tral charge c = 1 [20–22]. Likewise, we show that the
asymptotic behaviors of the entanglement entropy and
the zero-temperature fermion density as λ approaches the
endpoints of the critical interval (0,E(π)) are consistent
with a quantum (continuous) phase transition. We also
analyze the fermion density at ﬁnite temperature for a
particular class of models with elliptic interactions, ﬁnd-
ing that its behavior is nontrivial (for instance, it is not
always a monotonic function of the temperature, and it
can in fact present up to two extrema at ﬁnite tempera-
ture) when λ belongs to the critical interval.

The results of this paper suggest several lines for fu-
ture research. For one thing, they might prove relevant
for the su(2) analogs of the models discussed in this pa-
per, and most notably the spin 1/2 Inozemtsev and HS
chains in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld. Indeed, it has
been analytically shown that the su(1|1) HS chain with
zero chemical potential λ is equivalent in the thermody-
namic limit to its su(2) counterpart with zero magnetic
ﬁeld [17]. More recently, a numerical computation of the
free energy of the spin 1/2 elliptic chain with no mag-
netic ﬁeld suggests that this model and its su(1|1) version
with λ = 0 studied in this paper are also equivalent in
the thermodynamic limit [38]. If this equivalence could
be extended to the case of non-zero chemical potential
(or magnetic ﬁeld strength, for the su(2) models), the re-
sults of this work could be used, for instance, to evaluate
the ground state entanglement entropy of the spin 1/2
elliptic chain and its asymptotic limit when L tends to
inﬁnity.

Another line of research suggested by the present work
is the study of the entanglement entropy of the low-lying
states of the su(1|1) supersymmetric model (2) when the
chemical potential lies in the critical interval (0,E(π)).
Indeed, it has been recently shown [39, 40] that in a
(1+1)-dimensional CFT the quotient between the entan-
glement entropy of an excited state created by acting on
the vacuum with a primary ﬁeld and that of the ground
state is a universal quantity, essentially determined by
the conformal weights of the ﬁeld. Thus the computa-
tion of the entanglement entropy of the lowest excited
states of the model (2) when λ ∈ (0,E(π)), which can
be constructed from the equivalent fermionic model (5),
could shed some light on its underlying CFT.
