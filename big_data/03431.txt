ABSTRACT
Very high energy (VHE; energy E (cid:38) 100 GeV) γ rays originating from extragalac-
tic sources undergo pair production with low-energy photons of background radiation
ﬁelds. These pairs can inverse-Compton scatter background photons, initiating an elec-
tromagnetic cascade. The spatial and temporal structure of this secondary γ-ray signal
is altered as the e+e− pairs are deﬂected in an intergalactic magnetic ﬁeld (IGMF). We
investigate how VHE observations with the future Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA)
with its high angular resolution and broad energy range can potentially probe the
IGMF. We identify promising sources and simulate γ-ray spectra over a wide range of
values of the IGMF strength and coherence length using the publicly available ELMAG
Monte-Carlo code. Combining simulated observations in a joint likelihood approach,
we ﬁnd that current limits on the IGMF can be signiﬁcantly improved. The projected
sensitivity depends strongly on the time a source has been γ-ray active and on the
emitted maximum γ-ray energy.

1 INTRODUCTION

The origin of the magnetic ﬁelds ubiquitously present in
galaxies, galaxy clusters, and perhaps ﬁlaments of large
scale structure is yet unknown. The general consensus is
that pre-existing ﬁelds were ampliﬁed during the gravita-
tional collapse of forming structures via ﬂux compression
and dynamos (see, e.g., Widrow 2002; Kulsrud & Zweibel
2008; Durrer & Neronov 2013, for reviews). However, little
is known about the required seed ﬁelds. On the one hand,
they could have formed in the very early Universe during the
electroweak or QCD phase transition (e.g., Grasso & Rubin-
stein 2001; Widrow 2002) or during inﬂation (e.g., Durrer &
Neronov 2013). On the other hand, the seed ﬁelds could
be of astrophysical origin and could have been produced
during the formation of large scale structures at redshifts
z (cid:46) 10. The voids could have been polluted by magnetic
ﬁelds through galactic outﬂows caused by star formation
(Bertone et al. 2006) or active galactic nuclei (Rees 1987;
Daly & Loeb 1990; Ensslin et al. 1997; Furlanetto & Loeb
2001). The two scenarios could be discerned by measuring
the strength of intergalactic magnetic ﬁelds (IGMF) in voids,
B, and their coherence length λ simultaneously. The coher-

ence lengths of primordial ﬁelds should be λ (cid:46) kpc whereas
astrophysical ﬁelds should have ﬁeld strengths B (cid:46) 10−9 G
with λ (cid:38) kpc (Durrer & Neronov 2013).

So far, no direct measurements of B and λ exist. The
non-observation of Faraday rotation induced by an IGMF
in quasar observations leads to upper limits of B (cid:46) 10−9 G
for Mpc-scale coherence lengths (Blasi et al. 1999; Pshirkov
et al. 2015). If the IGMF is of primordial origin, it will af-
fect the primordial plasma and will leave speciﬁc imprints
on the spectrum and polarization of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB). Planck observations yield limits on the
primordial IGMF with B (cid:46) 10−9 G for λ = 1 Mpc, where the
exact value depends on the considered IGMF model (Ade
et al. 2015). Simulations of the formation of galaxy clusters
and the propagation of ultra-high energy cosmic rays sug-
gest lower values of the order of B (cid:46) 10−12 G (Sigl et al.
2004; Dolag et al. 2005).

Observation of γ rays originating from blazars, active
galactic nuclei (AGN) with their jet closely aligned along
the line of sight to the observer, provide an independent
probe of the IGMF. The very-high energy (VHE; energy
E (cid:38) 100 GeV) ﬂux of AGN is attenuated due to the interac-
tion of γ rays with photons of the extragalactic background
light (EBL), γ + γEBL → e+ + e− (Nikishov 1962; Jelley
1966; Gould & Schr´eder 1967a,b; Dwek & Krennrich 2013).

2 M. Meyer et al.

The produced pairs can inverse Compton (IC) scatter pho-
tons of the CMB and EBL and induce an electromagnetic
cascade (Protheroe & Stanev 1993). As the pairs are de-
ﬂected in the magnetic ﬁeld, the angular and time struc-
ture of the secondary photon signal depends on the strength
and morphology of the IGMF. Under the assumption of a
certain EBL model and intrinsic source spectrum, the non-
observation of the cascade component at GeV energies with
the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) led to a lower limit of
B (cid:38) 10−16 G for λ = 1 Mpc (Neronov & Vovk 2010; Tavec-
chio et al. 2011), or conversely a lower limit on the the ﬁlling
factor of the IGMF along the line of sight (Dolag et al. 2011).
Additionally, the IGMF induces a time delay of the cascade
emission compared to the primary source emission (Plaga
1995; Dai et al. 2002; Murase et al. 2008; Takahashi et al.
2008; Neronov & Semikoz 2009). If this is taken into account
together with conservative assumptions on the AGN γ-ray
activity, the limit is relaxed by several orders of magnitude,
B (cid:38) 10−19 G, as derived from semi-analytical models (Der-
mer et al. 2011; Huan et al. 2011; Finke et al. 2015) and full
Monte-Carlo simulations for simultaneous observations with
imaging air Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) and the Fermi-
LAT (Taylor et al. 2011). For small EBL photon densities
and taking uncertainties of the intrinsic source spectrum into
account, the hypothesis of a zero IGMF cannot be rejected
(Arlen et al. 2014).

Strong magnetic ﬁelds could also be detected through
the angular proﬁle of the γ-ray emission since the e+e−
pairs would be quickly isotropized and extended γ-ray halos
would form around sources (Aharonian et al. 1994; Neronov
& Semikoz 2009; Elyiv et al. 2009; Dolag et al. 2009).
No extended emission was found in H.E.S.S. observations
(Abramowski et al. 2014), whereas indications for pair-halo
was found in Fermi-LAT data, suggesting magnetic ﬁelds of
the order of 10−17 G (cid:46) B (cid:46) 10−15 G for λ = 1 Mpc (Chen
et al. 2015a).

A helical IGMF could be detected through parity odd
signatures of the arrival directions of γ rays produced in
the electromagnetic cascade (Tashiro & Vachaspati 2013).
An analysis of the diﬀuse γ-ray background observed with
Fermi LAT indeed suggests such correlations with favored
magnetic ﬁelds B ∼ 5 × 10−14 G ordered over 10 Mpc scales
(Chen et al. 2015b).
The cascade could be suppressed if the e+e− pairs
could loose their energy primarily via plasma instabilities in-
stead of inverse Compton scattering (Broderick et al. 2012).
Particle-in-cell simulations suggest that the energy loss due
to the instabilities plays only a sub-dominant role (Sironi &
Giannios 2014). However, as noted by Menzler & Schlick-
eiser (2015), these simulations require extrapolations over
many orders of magnitude in the density ratio between the
beam and the background plasma. The authors ﬁnd instead
a reduction of the cascade ﬂux by a factor of 0.1 for typical
blazars.

Assuming no energy losses in plasma instabilities, we
investigate the prospects of the future Cherenkov Telescope
Array (CTA) to detect the secondary cascade emission. The
array will be comprised of IACTs of diﬀerent sizes, covering
a large energy range between tens of GeV up to hundreds
of TeV with an expected sensitivity improvement of a fac-
tor of ten compared to currently operating IACTs (Actis
et al. 2011). The energy resolution is envisaged to be of

the order of 10 %-15 % and the spatial resolution of the or-
der of arcmin. The broad energy coverage allows to detect
the primary and secondary spectral component simultane-
ously. Throughout this paper, the “Array E” conﬁguration of
CTA will be assumed which provides good sensitivity over
the entire energy range (Bernl¨ohr et al. 2013). Current lim-
its often rely on the combination of IACT and Fermi-LAT
data, which are usually non-simultaneous and suﬀer from the
systematic uncertainty of potentially diﬀerent energy scales.
These issues are avoided with CTA observations.

The article is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we present
our source selection for promising blazars to search for the
cascade. As described in Sec. 3, we use the publicly avail-
able ELMAG Monte-Carlo code to generate spectra including
a cascade for a wide range of IGMF morphologies. We use a
standard likelihood ratio test to search for the cascade com-
ponent (Sec. 4) and combine observations in a joint likeli-
hood. We present our results in Sec. 5 before concluding in
Sec. 6.

2 SOURCE SELECTION

Promising targets to search for the cascade are blazars whose
intrinsic emission extends to energies where the EBL ab-
sorption is strong. This requires sources with a hard intrinsic
spectrum characterized by a simple power law without a cut-
oﬀ, dN/dE ∝ E−Γ, with Γ (cid:46) 2. Bonnoli et al. (2015) found
that, in addition to being a high synchtrotron peaked BL Lac
(HBL, log10(νsync/Hz) > 15), promising sources also show a
high ratio between the X-ray and radio ﬂux, FX/FR (cid:38) 104,
as well as an optical spectrum dominated by host galaxy.
1ES 0229+200 is a typical example for such an “extreme”
HBL (EHBL, Costamante et al. 2001).

We follow these requirements and select sources from
the second Fermi catalog of hard sources detected above
50 GeV (2FHL, Ackermann et al. 2016), that fulﬁll the fol-
lowing criteria:

determine the strength of the absorption.

• Their redshift is known. Otherwise, it is not possible to
• They are HBLs, i.e. log10(νsync/Hz) > 15.
• They show a high ratio between their X-ray and radio
ﬂux, FX/FR > 103, where the ﬂuxes are taken form the third
Fermi-LAT AGN catalog (3LAC, Ackermann et al. 2015).
• Integrating their observed 2FHL spectra between 1 TeV
and 2 TeV should result in at least 1 % of the integrated
ﬂux of the Crab Nebula in the same energy range (assuming
the VHE Crab spectrum measured with H.E.S.S., Aharonian
et al. 2006).
• The absorption corrected spectra in the 2FHL
(Dom´ınguez & Ajello 2015) follow power laws with an index
Γ (cid:54) 1.7. This value is chosen a posteriori, as softer spectra
do not turn out to lead to a sizable ﬂux of the cascade pho-
tons. By making this cut, we assume that the Fermi-LAT
observations are not contaminated by the cascade. As we
will see in Sec. 3, this is justiﬁed taking the 2FHL error bars
of most sources into account.
• The sources should show little γ-ray variability as we
assume a steady γ-ray emission to calculate the cascade.
Following Finke et al. (2015), we select sources with a vari-
ability index < 100 as provided in the third Fermi source

MNRAS 000, 1–10 (2016)

catalog (3FGL, Acero et al. 2015). This corresponds to a
4.8 σ signiﬁcance that the source is variable.
• They culminate at low zenith angles, Z (cid:54) 20◦, in order
to guarantee an energy threshold as low as possible. For
this selection, we assume latitudes of −24◦ and 29◦ for the
southern and northern CTA site, respectively.

In addition of the above criteria, we demand that the cascade
photons have an energy > 50 GeV. As the IC scattering with
CMB photons with an average energy (cid:104)CMB(cid:105) ≈ 634 µeV
occurs entirely in the Thomson regime, the average energy
of a cascade photon is
(cid:104)(cid:105) =

with an electron Lorentz factor is γ = E/2mec2, where me
is the mass of the electron and E the energy of the primary
γ ray. We estimate the maximum cascade photon energy
from head-on IC scattering in the Thompson regime with
a CMB photon with an energy of CMB,99 ≈ 2 meV. The
integral over the CMB photon density up to this energy is
equal to 99 % of the same integral between [0;∞). One ﬁnds
a maximum cascade energy
max = 4CMB,99γ2 ≈ 9(cid:104)(cid:105).
To decide whether max falls inside the CTA energy range,
one has to make an assumption about the maximum energy
of the primary γ-ray spectrum. We assume that the spec-
trum extends to an energy where the optical depth τ = 5
(we will scrutinize this assumption in Sec. 5). Evidence for
emission at energies beyond τ > 5 has been found in several
blazar observations, e.g. for 1ES 0229+200 (Aharonian et al.
2007), PKS 1424+240 (Archambault et al. 2014) with z (cid:62)
0.6035 (Furniss et al. 2013), and PKS 0447-121 (Abramowski
et al. 2013) assuming the redshift of z = 0.343 ± 0.002
(Muriel et al. 2015).

In total, 9 HBLs listed in the 2FHL survive the ap-
plied cuts. From this list we further exclude the already
TeV detected sources IC 310, RBS 0413, RX J0648.7+1516,
1RXS J101015.9-311909, and B3 2247+381. None of the
IACT spectra extend to high optical depths and the mea-
sured indices are signiﬁcantly softer than the ones listed in
the 2FHL. The remaining 4 blazars are listed in Tab. 1. We
append 1ES 0229+200 to the list, even though the source is
not included in the 2FHL.

3 SIMULATIONS

3.1 Cascade Simulations

The development of electromagnetic cascades in the inter-
galactic medium is simulated with the open-source Monte
Carlo code ELMAG (for more details see Kachelrieß et al.
2012). ELMAG computes the resultant photon distribution
based on initial prescriptions for the shape of the intrin-
sic γ-ray spectrum, the spectrum and redshift evolution of
the EBL, and the large-scale conﬁguration of the IGMF. It
adopts the simplifying assumption that the IGMF can be
completely characterised by a universal intensity B, and a
cell-like structure with coherence length λ. Both the scat-
tering of the e+e− pairs on EBL and CMB photons is taken
into account. Photons with an energy above  (cid:62) thr are

traced where we set thr = 1 GeV. Energy losses due to syn-
chrotron radiation and IC scattering are integrated out for
energies < thr. We choose to trace all particles, i.e. setting
αsample = 0 (Kachelrieß et al. 2012).
Under the assumption that the e+e− pairs do not loose
energy in plasma instabilities, we simulate the ﬁnal photon
distribution from 6 × 105 injected primary γ rays with the
following ﬁducial values of model parameters for each con-
sidered source:

• The intrinsic γ-ray spectrum is given by a power law,
dN/dE ∝ E−Γ, with the absorption corrected index of the
2FHL (see Tab. 1). For 1ES 0229+200, we assume an intrin-
sic index Γ = 1.7.
• We choose the EBL model of Dom´ınguez et al. (2011).
• We assume that the primary γ-ray emission extends
to an energy for which τmax = 5. Beyond this energy, the
emission is zero.
• An opening angle of the blazar jet of θj = 6◦ is assumed.
In the approximation that the Doppler factor is equal to the
bulk Lorentz factor ΓL of the emitting plasma, this implies
ΓL ∼ θ
• We simulate cascades for values of (B, λ) on a (9 × 9)
logarithmic spaced grid with BG = B/G ∈ [10−19; 10−11]
and λMpc = λ/Mpc ∈ [10−6; 102]. These parameters cover
the evidences for a non-zero IGMF (Chen et al. 2015a,b) as
well as scenarios for astrophyical or primordial origins of the
IGMF (e.g., Durrer & Neronov 2013).

ELMAG outputs the total observed spectrum F with pri-
mary and cascade emission binned in energy, angular sep-
aration δθ, and time delay δt. Both δθ and δt are due to
the deﬂection of the e+e− pairs in the IGMF. We show
an example of the output photon distribution as a func-
tion of energy and δθ (δt) for one pair of (B, λ) values for
1ES 0229+200 in Fig. 1. The distributions follow the theo-
retical expectations that δθ ∝ −1B and δt ∝ −5/2B2 since

cooling length (Neronov & Semikoz 2009). With the Thom-
son cross section σT and the energy density of the CMB

3.2 CTA Simulations

We generate CTA observations by folding the ELMAG out-
put spectra with the CTA instrumental response function
(IRF) for the “array E” conﬁguration. The IRF and the ex-
pected background rate has been determined from Monte-
Carlo simulations (Bernl¨ohr et al. 2013). For each source
(except 1ES 0229+200), we simulate a Tobs = 20 hours ob-
servation under a constant zenith angle of 20◦ and a ratio
between source and oﬀ-source exposure of α = 0.2. AGN ob-
servations of this duration are envisaged during the initial
years of data taking (The CTA Consortium 2016). Since we
assume 1ES 0229+200 to have the softest intrinsic spectrum
of all considered sources, the observation time is doubled to
40 hours.

Table 1. Sources selected for simulation. In addition to the source coordinates we give the redshift z (the redshift of PMN J1548-2251 is
taken from Shaw et al. 2013), the highest energy photon, EHEP, the energy at which τ = 5, Eτ =5, the peak frequency of the synchrotron
emission, the integrated energy ﬂux F between Ethr and Eτ =5 assumed for the simulation, the spectral index of the intrinsic blazar
spectrum Γ with its uncertainty, and the X-ray to radio ﬂux ratio. X-ray and radio ﬂuxes are taken from the 3LAC. The values for the
coordinates, EHEP, νsync, and Γ (derived by de-absorbing the observed spectra with the EBL model of Dom´ınguez et al. 2011) are taken
from the 2FHL.

the top panel of Fig. 1). Furthermore, we assume that the
sources have been active for 10 years, approximately the time
that γ-ray sources have been observed (red solid line in the
bottom panel of Fig. 1). In Section 5, we examine the impact
on the results if this cut is relaxed. The remaining fraction
of the ELMAG output spectra is then interpolated with a cu-
bic spline in order to guarantee a smooth spectrum for the
CTA simulation. The spectra are rescaled, so that the in-
tegrated ﬂux above a certain energy threshold Ethr > max
is independent of (B, λ). The assumed integrated ﬂuxes and
values for Ethr are listed in Tab. 1. For PG 1218+304, the
integrated ﬂux and Ethr are chosen to match the VERITAS
observation of this source (Madhavan & for the VERITAS
Collaboration 2013). For 1ES 0229+200 we chose the values
obtained with H.E.S.S. observations (Aharonian et al. 2007).
For PMN J1548-2251 and 1RXS 023832.6-311658 we assume
values similar to 1ES 0229+200, namely that the integrated
ﬂux above 500 GeV is equal to 2 % of the integrated ﬂux
of the Crab Nebula (C.U.) whereas for B2 0806+35 we take
F = 5 % C.U. above 1 TeV (the Crab nebula spectrum is
taken from Aharonian et al. 2006). All the assumed values
are compatible with the results from the 2FHL.

We further note that the extrapolation of the intrinsic
spectra up to Eτ =5 yields luminosities L that are consistent
with the requirement that the radiation power P of the jet is
less than half the Eddigton luminosity P ∼ L/4Γ2
L (cid:54) Ledd/2
(Bonnoli et al. 2011), where we again approximated δD ∼
ΓL. Following Meyer et al. (2012), we derive the luminos-
ity by integrating the intrinsic spectra between 50 GeV and
Eτ =5 and multiply the integral with (1− z)2−Γ × 4πd2
L. The
ﬁrst factor accounts for the K-correction and dL is the lu-
minosity distance. Generically assuming black hole masses
of 108.5M(cid:12), we ﬁnd that P is at most ∼0.2 % of Ledd for
PG 1218+304.

Following Meyer & Conrad (2014), the rescaled and
interpolated spectra are folded with the IRF and multi-
plied with the observation time to yield the number of ex-
pected counts for each source in energy bin i, µi. The num-
ber of background events bi is obtained by mutliplying the
background rate derived from Monte-Carlo simulations with
Tobs. Adjacent energy bins in which the source is detected
with a signiﬁcance Si < 2 σ are combined into one bin (the
signiﬁcance is evaluated with Eq. (17) of Li & Ma 1983). If
the signiﬁcance of the combined bin is still below 2 σ, the bin
is discarded. We show examples of the rescaled ELMAG spec-

excess is present.

4 ANALYSIS METHOD

Higher values of the IGMF strength and coherence length
will lead to a stronger deﬂection of the e+e− pairs and cause
larger time delays and angular separations of the cascade
photons. With our chosen cuts on δt and δθ this implies a di-
minished cascade ﬂux. We use a poisson likelihood ratio test
to determine the compatibility of a magnetic-ﬁeld hypothe-
sis characterized through the expected number of counts µ
for one set of values (B, λ) with mock data D, generated
under the same or a diﬀerent hypothesis. For expected sig-
nal counts µi and background counts bi in the i-th energy
bin, the likelihood to observe xi counts from the sky-region
including a source and yi counts from a background region
is
L(µi, bi; α|xi, yi) = Pois(xi|µi + bi) Pois(yi|bi/α).
We only consider energy bins for which we expect a contri-
bution from the cascade, Ei < max, where Ei is the central
energy of each bin. We further only select bins for which the
detection signiﬁcance of the source is Si > 2 σ.

(4)

The number of expected counts depends on the tested
B-ﬁeld hypothesis and on the intrinsic γ-ray spectrum. The
latter can be determined from a power-law ﬁt (including

contribution is negligible, i.e. Ei > max. Example ﬁts are
shown in Fig. 2 as red solid lines. The obtained best-ﬁt pa-
rameters are then independent of the IGMF. The ﬁt un-
certainty can be incorporated into the likelihood by an eﬃ-
ciency term, βi. The likelihood for this additional nuisance
parameter can be assumed to follow a Gaussian, so that the
total likelihood becomes
L(µi, θi; α, σi|xi, yi) = (2πσ2
i )

−1/2 exp(−(1 − βi)2/2σ2

×L(βiµi, bi; α|xi, yi),

where θi = (bi, βi) denotes the nuisance parameters, and
σi is the relative theoretical ﬂux uncertainty in the i-th en-
ergy bin from the full covariance matrix of the power-law ﬁt
(light red shaded areas in Fig. 2). We make the simplifying
assumption that the best-ﬁt intrinsic spectrum is equal to
the input spectrum. Further systematic uncertainties can be
implemented in a similar way.

Instead of generating many Monte-Carlo realizations for
the mock data sets, we make use of the so-called Asimov data
set for which x and y are equal to the expected number of
counts (Cowan et al. 2011). Denoting the expected number
of counts for the IGMF hypothesis under which the data is
generated with µD, the Asimov data set is xi = µD
i + bi
and yi = bi/α. For each source, we combine the likelihoods
of all considered energy bins and proﬁle over the nuisance
parameters. The likelihood ratio test (or test statistic, TS)
is then

Applying Wilks’ Theorem, the test statistic should
asymptotically follow a χ2 distribution with 2 degrees of
freedom ν for the two model parameters (B, λ). This allows
ν =2 with
us to convert the TS values into a signiﬁcance pχ2
which we can exclude a magnetic-ﬁeld hypothesis for a given
mock data set. To improve the sensitivity, the likelihoods of
the diﬀerent sources are combined by adding the TS values.

5 RESULTS

We generate mock data samples for three diﬀerent repre-
sentative IGMF conﬁgurations: D1 = (BG = 10−15; λMpc =
10−6), D2 = (BG = 10−16; λMpc = 1), and D3 = (BG =
10−13; λMpc = 10). The hypothesis D1 corresponds to the
case where the IGMF is of primordial origin (e.g. Durrer
& Neronov 2013) and is still allowed by the limits derived
by Finke et al. (2015). The small values of λ will suppress
large deﬂection of the e+e− pairs. On the other hand, the
values of D3, close to the IGMF conﬁguration suggested by
observations of the diﬀuse γ-ray background (Chen et al.
2015b), will lead to large deﬂections and most cascade pho-
tons will arrive with large time delays and outside r80. The
D2 scenario corresponds to an intermediate case in terms
of deﬂections and tests the hint for a non-zero IGMF de-
duced from evidence for of pair halos in Fermi-LAT data
(Chen et al. 2015a). Fields with such values of λ could be
generated by outﬂows from AGN (e.g. Furlanetto & Loeb
2001).

Figure 3 shows the possible limits in the (B, λ) plane
obtained from the observation of each source alone for Dj,
j = 1, 2, 3 and the ﬁducial set of model parameters. Both
cuts on the angular separation and delay time are applied.
The most constraining limits come from the simulated ob-
servation of B2 0806+35. The assumption for the intrinsic
spectrum are the most optimistic of our source sample as we
extrapolate the 2FHL spectrum up to Eτ =5 ∼ 14 TeV albeit
the smallest ratio of X-ray to radio ﬂux (compare Tab. 1).
This high-energy cutoﬀ causes a plenitude of cascade pho-
tons in the energy range of CTA. Such an observation would
lead to strong bounds on the IGMF with possible exclusions
beyond the 5 σ conﬁdence level. On the other hand, for the
highest redshift source, and therefore smallest maximum en-
ergy Eτ =5 ∼ 4 TeV, no IGMF value can be ruled out. This
is already obvious from Fig. 2: the source is too faint below
max to distinguish between the diﬀerent IGMF scenarios.
In the case of 1ES 0229+200 the ﬁt uncertainties are large
and therefore no exclusions are possible if Tobs = 20 hours.
Doubling the observation time leads to mild exclusions, as
visible in Fig. 3. The two remaining sources give similar
constraints at the 2 − 3 σ level for D1 and D3. For D2, the
diﬀerences in the spectra are not pronounced enough to rule
out IGMF conﬁgurations leading to either smaller or larger
deﬂections. As expected, the limits are independent of the
coherence length as long as λ (cid:29) DIC. The small structures

in the exclusion plots can be explained with the intrinsic
scatter of the ELMAG simulations.

We combine the likelihoods of the sources and re-
evaluate the exclusion regions (Fig. 4, top panels). For the
reasons above, we exclude the source B2 0806+35. The limits
considerably improve for all tested hypotheses. If the IGMF
conﬁgurations close to D3 are realized in nature, CTA ob-
servations could improve current limits (Finke et al. 2015)
by two orders of magnitude. The D1 case results in strin-

gent upper bounds on the IGMF strength with BG (cid:38) 10−14
for all values of λ. For D2, the combined likelihood leads
to an exclusion of magnetic ﬁelds smaller than 10−17 G at
3 σ. Larger ﬁelds are at tension with the data at 1 − 2 σ.
As the single-source limits, the combined limits only show a
dependence on the coherence length if λMpc (cid:46) 10−2.

Relaxing the cut on the maximum delay time has a
strong impact on the sensitivity to the detection of cascade
photons (Fig. 4, bottom panels). Applying no cut on the

maximum time delay at all is certainly an oversimpliﬁcation
due to ﬁnite AGN lifetimes which are estimated to lie be-
tween 106 and 108 years (e.g Parma et al. 2002). However,
we do not expect a signiﬁcant change if we would instead
assume δt < 108 years, as even for the tested IGMF leading

to the largest delays (BG = 10−11, λMpc = 100), a signiﬁ-
cant fraction of the cascade photons still arrives with smaller
delays. Interestingly, comparing the δt < 10 year case to
the case with no time cut, one sees that for conﬁgurations
leading to small deﬂections (as in D1), the projected limits

worsen by two orders of magnitude. The reason is that more
cascade photons reach the observer since the δt cut is more
stringent than the requirement δθ < r80 (cf. Fig 1). As a
result, increasing B or λ will have a weaker eﬀect on the
spectra up to the point where δθ > r80. Consequently, con-
ﬁgurations with BG (cid:46) 10−15 cannot be distinguished with
high signiﬁcance from a zero IGMF regardless of λ. This
also explains the diﬀerences in D2 and D3. Because of this
degeneracy between the applied cut on δt and the IGMF
conﬁguration, small values of δt only lead to conservative
limits if the goal is exclude conﬁgurations in which the e+e−
deﬂections are small (the D3 hypothesis, right panels of Fig.
4).

We further investigate the dependence of the projected
limits on the chosen EBL model and energy of the spectral
cutoﬀ in Fig. 5. In the top panels, the EBL model of Finke
et al. (2010) is used instead of the photon density predicted
by Dom´ınguez et al. (2011), while Eτ =5 is held constant. For
the Finke et al. model, the limits are strengthened since the
attenuation is slightly higher for sources with z (cid:38) 0.1. As the
attenuation increases, so does the number distribution of the
e+e− pairs, which is given in the steady-state approximation
by

where ˙γ is the energy loss of the pairs due to IC scatter-
ing and Q(γ) = dN/dE(1 − exp(−τ )) is the injection rate
with E = 2mec2γ. As the intrinsic γ-ray spectrum is hard,
N (γ) ∝ γ−2, and is thus dominated by low energy pairs
(Tavecchio et al. 2011). For γ = 5 × 104 (corresponding
to a 50 GeV γ ray), N (γ) is about 4 % to 5 % larger for
the Finke et al. (2010) model. Considering instead the EBL
model of Dom´ınguez et al. (2011) but lower the maximum
spectral energy to the value that corresponds to τmax = 4
decreases the sensitivity signiﬁcantly (central panel of Fig.
5). The situation is reversed if we increase the maximum en-
ergy so that τmax = 6 (lower panels of Fig. 4).1 In this case,
the IGMF strength could be determined within one order of
magnitude in the D2 scenario. These ﬁndings underline the
necessity that the intrinsic spectra need to extend to ener-
gies as high as possible in order to derive strong constraints
on the IGMF.
We have also tested the dependence on the jet opening
angle and even a highly collimated jet with θj = 1◦ has a
negligible eﬀect on the limits.

6 CONCLUSIONS

Utilizing a standard likelihood ratio test, future observa-
tions with CTA of a small number of certain HBLs will yield
strong constraints of the IGMF. Especially HBLs with hard
spectra that extend to energies corresponding to an opti-
cal depth of τ (cid:38) 5 are particularly well suited since a large
amount of energy will be re-processed in the electromag-
netic cascade. The large energy range covered with CTA
allows to probe the EBL cutoﬀ (Mazin et al. 2013) and to

ensure no intrinsic spectral break. Simultaneously, one can
search for cascade photons at the low energy end of the spec-
tra. Throughout this article, we have assumed the “array E”
conﬁguration of CTA (Bernl¨ohr et al. 2013). The ﬁnal con-
straints derived from real data will depend on the actually
realized conﬁguration and data analysis.

Nevertheless, CTA observations should be able to either
conﬁrm or rule out evidence of a non-zero IGMF (e.g. Essey
et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2015a,b) and improve current limits
on its ﬁeld strength and coherence length by orders of mag-
nitude (e.g. Arlen et al. 2014; Finke et al. 2015). Especially
if IGMF conﬁgurations are realized in nature that lead to
either strong or very small deﬂections of the e+e− pairs, it
will be possible to rule out large fractions of the IGMF pa-
rameter space. Magnetic ﬁelds of the order of B ∼ 10−16 G
with coherence lengths λ ∼ 1 Mpc will be more diﬃcult to
constrain as the cascade radiation will only lead to a slight
excess over the primary γ-ray emission.

CTA observations will in general not be able to dis-
tinguish between a primordial or astrophysical origin of
the IGMF. Furthermore, the sensitivity estimates depend
strongly on the assumed cutoﬀ energy of the spectra. Spec-
tra extending only up to energies so that τmax = 4 will not
generate suﬃcient cascade radiation to constrain the IGMF.
If, on the other hand, the spectra reach very high energies
with optical depths τ ∼ 6, primordial IGMF scenarios could
be ruled out given that the coherence length is λ (cid:38) 0.1 Mpc.
The projected limits also strongly depend on the assumed
γ-ray activity time of the AGN. The maximum allowed de-
lay time of cascade photons is degenerate with the IGMF
strength and small values of δt only yield conservative lim-
its if small values of values of the IGMF strength are to be
constrained. It should be noted that the cell-like morphology
of the IGMF adopted in the ELMAG code neglects the depen-
dence of the limits on the actual IGMF power spectrum
(Caprini & Gabici 2015). Especially for red power spectra,
the cell-like assumption breaks down and lower limits on the
IGMF have to be relaxed.

We have only used photons arriving within the 80 %
containment radius of the PSF. In future work, the analysis
should be extended to incorporate the extended pair-halo
emission. This will add further information to the likelihood
and will make it easier to distinguish between IGMF sce-
narios. Interestingly, due to the time delay of the cascade
photons, such halos could still be present even if the source
already ceased its activity (Neronov et al. 2010; Inoue et al.
2011) and could be searched for the envisaged CTA extra-
galactic survey.
