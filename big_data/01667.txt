Fully Coupled Simulation of the Plasma Liquid

Interface and Interfacial Coefﬁcient Effects

Alexander Lindsay, David Graves, and Steven Shannon

March 8, 2016

Abstract

There is a growing interest in the study of coupled plasma-liquid systems because of their
applications to biomedicine, biological and chemical disinfection, agriculture, and other areas.
Optimizing these applications requires a fundamental understanding of the coupling between
phases. Though much progress has been made in this regard, there is still more to be done. One
area that requires more research is the transport of electrons across the plasma-liquid interface.
Some pioneering works ([1, 2]) have begun revealing the near-surface liquid characteristics of
electrons. However, there has been little work to determine the near-surface gas phase electron
characteristics. Without an understanding of the near-surface gas dynamics, modellers are left
to make assumptions about the interfacial conditions. For instance it is commonly assumed
that the surface loss or sticking coefﬁcient of gas-phase electrons at the interface is equal to
1. In this work we explore the consequences of this assumption and introduce a couple of
ways to think about the electron interfacial condition. In one set of simulations we impose a
kinetic condition with varying surface loss coefﬁcient on the gas phase interfacial electrons.
In a second set of simulations we introduce a Henry’s law like condition at the interface in
which the gas-phase electron concentration is assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium
with the liquid-phase electron concentration. It is shown that for a range of electron Henry
coefﬁcients spanning a range of known hydrophilic specie Henry coefﬁcients, the gas phase
electron density in the anode can vary by orders of magnitude. Varying reﬂection of electrons
by the interface also has consequences for the electron energy proﬁle; increasing reﬂection may
lead to increasing thermalization of electrons depending on choices about the electron energy
boundary condition. This variation in anode electron density and energy as a function of the
interface characteristics could also lead to signiﬁcant variation in near-surface gas chemistries
when such reactions are included in the model; this could very well in turn affect the reac-
tive species impinging on the liquid surface. We draw the conclusion that in order to make
more conﬁdent model predictions about plasma-liquid systems, ﬁner scale simulations and/or

new experimental techniques must be used to elucidate the near-surface gas phase electron
dynamics.

1 Introduction

In the low-temperature plasma community there is a burgeoning interest in the study of plasma-
liquid systems for both basic and applied research purposes. Applications stemming from the in-
teractions of plasmas and liquids include biomedicine and biological disinfection [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
chemical disinfection [9, 10, 11], and agricultural uses. [12, 13] To most effectively utilize plasma-
liquid systems requires a fundamental knowledge of their behavior; many researchers are now ac-
tively contributing to that knowledge through both experimental [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 1] and
modelling efforts. [20, 21, 22, 23] Though much progress has been made, there is still much that
is unknown, particularly in the interfacial region where the plasma meets the liquid. For instance,
little is really known about how electrons are transported across the interface. Most studies in the
literature consider solvation of electrons generated in the aqueous bulk by radiolysis. [24, 25] A
highly energetic electron is ejected from the solvent molecule and is initially delocalized in the
solvent’s conduction band. Eventually the electron is localized in a solvent trap and is electroni-
cally relaxed. The electron relaxation is accompanied by orientation of the solvent molecules to
solvate the rapidly changing charge distribution. [24] While this qualitatively explains the behavior
of several eV electrons generated in the liquid bulk, researchers are keen to learn what additional
physiochemical effects might be associated with electron transport across an interface. Rumbach
et. al. [1] used absorption spectroscopy to detect the presence of solvated electrons in the surface
region with an estimated penetration depth of 2.5 nm. A molecular dynamics study indicates that
electrons at the surface of water only have about 10% of their density protruding into the vapor
phase, suggesting that their behavior should be much more characteristic of a fully hydrated as op-
posed to a half-hydrated species. [26] These studies help elucidate the character of the liquid phase
side of the interface. However, little work has been done to understand the electron behavior on the
gas phase side of the interface. Common gas discharge modelling parameters like the surface loss
coefﬁcient for electrons are unknown for the gas-liquid interface. To date plasma-liquid models
have assumed a surface loss coefﬁcient of unity [21, 23], however, there is no known molecular
scale simulations or experimental measurements to indicate that this assumption should be true.

The modelling work here explores consequences of the above assumption and the uncertainty in
electron dynamics on the gas phase side of the interface. To do this, a simple model 1D DC Argon
discharge with a water anode is used. The purpose of the work is not to make deﬁnitive predictions
about the behavior at the plasma-liquid interface but rather to present a range of results that may
encompass the true physical behavior. Additionally, the authors hope that the research presented
here may motivate deeper studies of the gas-phase side of the interface, whether it be through ab

2

initio calculations or experimental techniques.

For this paper, both kinetic and thermodynamic descriptions of the electron density at the interface
are considered. A description of the 1D fully-coupled plasma-liquid model is given in section 2.
In section 3 it is shown that by varying the interfacial electron surface loss coefﬁcient in the kinetic
description or a Henry’s law like coefﬁcient in the thermodynamic description, the electron density
on the gas phase side of the interface can be changed by orders of magnitude. Moreover, if electrons
coming from the bulk are not absorbed at the interface, they become thermalized through non-
recombinatory collisions. Conclusions are given in section 4. A brief description of the novel code
used to implement the model is given in section 6. Anyone interested in downloading and using
the code may access it at https://github.com/lindsayad/zapdos.

2 Model Description

The fully coupled 1D plasma liquid model is implemented in a code developed by the authors. A
brief description of the code, which is open source and free to use [27], is given in section 6. In
the model, a DC atmospheric pressure argon discharge impinges on a very thin water layer. The
powered electrode is biased negatively, making it the cathode. From the plasma’s perspective, the
water surface is the anode. Only elastic collisions, ground state ionization, and ground state exci-
tation are considered. The model governing equations are described below. Continuity equations
based on the drift-diffusion approximation are solved for the electrons and ions:

where vth,k is the thermal velocity of species k and ng
is the density of secondary electrons. All
rk’s are set to zero at the cathode. At the interface of the plasma with the liquid phase, the ion
boundary condition is the same as for the cathode with ri = 0. For electrons in the gas phase two
formulations are considered. The ﬁrst is the kinetic formulation given by eq. (10) where rdens is
variable. The second is a thermodynamic formulation analogous to Henry’s law where the ratio
of the liquid phase electron density to the gas phase electron density is speciﬁed by a variable H
(equivalent to a Henry’s Law coefﬁcient):

Hne,g = ne,l

(15)

The electron energy interfacial condition is the kinetic one, see eq. (11). Though rdens (or H for the
thermodynamic electron BC) at the interface is varied in the results that follow, ren is held constant
at 0for most simulations. This is done for the following physical reasoning. Electrons can either
pass freely into the liquid phase, carrying their energy with them, or they can be reﬂected. If they
are reﬂected, then it is reasonable to expect these electrons to lose their energy in surface collisions
such as vibrational excitation of H2O until they are incorporated into the liquid. Thus though some
electrons coming from the bulk may be reﬂected, it may be reasonable to assume that all the elec-
tron energy coming from the bulk is absorbed by the interface. However, in the interest of covering
all realms of possibility (perhaps most electron collisions at the interface are low-loss elastic colli-
sions for example), a study is conducted in which the amount of energy absorbed/reﬂected by the
interface is varied. This is done by changing g en. Note that in the plots and discussion to follow, the
surface loss coefﬁcients g dens and g en will often be used instead of the reﬂection coefﬁcients rdens
and ren. The relationship between surface loss and reﬂection coefﬁcients is simply g k = 1 − rk.

The liquid phase electron density interfacial condition is given simply by the continuity of ﬂux. At
the bottom of the liquid, electrons are assumed to recombine or ﬂow out at a rate equivalent to the
advective ﬂux.

For potential conditions, V is set to zero at the end of the liquid domain. At the cathode, Kirchoff’s
voltage law for a circuit including a ballast resistor yields:

Vsource +Vcathode =(cid:16)e~G

5

i − e~G e(cid:17)AR

(16)

where A is the cross-sectional area of the plasma and R is the ballast resistance.

Gas phase electron coefﬁcients were calculated in the following way: Argon ionizization, excita-
tion, and elastic collision cross sections were taken from the Phelps database [30] at [31]. Then
using the open source Boltzmann solver Bolos [32] based on the work of Hagelaar [33] electron
energy distribution functions were calculated for 200 electric ﬁeld points between 103 and 107
V/m. Then for each distribution function, µe, De, e , and the necessary electron collision rate coefﬁ-
cients were calculated as deﬁned by [33]. Transport and rate cofﬁcients were tabulated against the
mean energy. These lookup-tables were then referenced during solution of the ﬂuid equations. The
details of the inputs for the ﬂuid simulations are given in tables 1 and 2 and ﬁgure 1. Mesh sizes
for the simulations were typically around 200 elements with most elements located in the cathode
and interfacial regions. Each individual simulation took between 12 and 60 seconds to run.

Figure 2 shows the electron density in both the gas and liquid phases as a function of the interfacial
surface loss coefﬁcient. The cathode and bulk proﬁles are unaffected by changing g dens. However,
as one might expect, decreasing the surface loss coefﬁcient leads to a build-up of electrons on the
gas phase side of the interface, seen more clearly in ﬁg. 3. Similar behavior can be achieved by
decreasing the H coefﬁcient in eq. (15) and ﬁg. 5. In order to observe anode characteristics akin to
those for a plasma in contact with a metallic electrode (g dens = 1), H must be on the order of 106.
This is on the same order of magnitude as Henry’s Law coefﬁcients for H2O2 and HNO3, both
very hydrophilic species. If H is reduced to 104, the gas phase electron density near the interface
increases by an order of magnitude. If H is further reduced to 102, only slightly less hydrophilic
than OH, then the gas phase interfacial density rockets up to three orders of magnitude greater than
the metallic anode base case. Decreasing H further only continues the trend.

Figure 7: Electric ﬁeld near the interface as a function of the interfacial surface loss coefﬁcient

Despite the dramatic functional dependence of the gas phase electron density in the anode, the
liquid phase electron density proﬁle remains unchanged as g dens is varied. The reason for this can
be seen by looking at ﬁg. 6. Like the liquid phase electron density proﬁle, the potential drop across
the plasma-liquid system is unaffected by changing g dens. This means that the system DC current
is also unaffected, roughly 1000 Amps m−2 for all simulation cases. Away from the cathode, all
the current is carried by electrons, thus the electron current at the interface between the gas and
liquid must also remain unchanged as g dens is varied. With the liquid phase electron input thus
unaffected by g dens, the liquid phase electron density proﬁle remains constant. Varying g dens does
change the potential and electric ﬁeld proﬁles near the interface; this is shown in ﬁg. 7. From the
low reﬂection to high reﬂection extremes, the interfacial electric ﬁeld increases by about a factor
of seven.

Figure 9: Electron temperature as a function of the interfacial surface loss coefﬁcient

As with the electron density, the cathode and bulk electron temperature proﬁles in ﬁg. 9 do not
change as g dens is varied. However, there is major variation in the anode. This variation arises from
the assumption described in the model description section that electrons coming from the bulk ei-
ther carry their energy into the liquid phase upon absorption or else if reﬂected lose their energy
through interfacial surface collisions. The greater the reﬂection, the lower the average energy of
electrons near the interface because of non-recombinatory surface collisions. This is what is ob-
served in ﬁg. 9. This trend in electron energy also explains the slight variation in anode ion density
proﬁles seen in ﬁg. 8. Lower electron mean energy near the interface means a smaller fraction of
electrons with sufﬁcient energy to create ionization and a smaller Townsend ionization coefﬁcient.
Because in this model ionization is proportional to the electron ﬂux magnitude and because the
electron ﬂux magnitude is constant with respecto to g dens, the decrease in a
iz corresponds to a de-
crease in the rate of ionization. Hence the ion density rises to its bulk value farther from the anode
for decreasing g dens.

Figure 11: Gas phase electron temperature as a function of the electron energy interfacial surface

loss coefﬁcient. (g dens = 10−2 for all cases)

The physically correct boundary condition for the electron energy at the interface is unknown.
However, we can vary the amount of electron energy that is absorbed/reﬂected at the interface
and see whether that affects the most important result of the above ﬁgures: that interfacial electron
density increases signiﬁcantly as the electron surface loss coefﬁcient is decreased. Figure 10 shows
the effect of varying the amount of energy lost at the interface when g dens is kept constant at 10−2.
A couple of trends are notable. The ﬁrst is that as the energy reﬂection is increased, e.g. as
g en is decreased, the bulk electron density increases; moreover, instead of retaining a ﬂat proﬁle
through the bulk, the electron density increases almost linearly moving from cathode to anode.
Additionally, as g en decreases the jump in electron density at the anode/interface decreases. The
combination of these effects results in anodic electron densities that differ by less than a factor
of two over values of g en that span four orders of magnitude. Moreover, no matter the value of
g en, the anodic electron density with g dens = 10−2 is over an order of magnitude higher than if
the surface loss coefﬁcients for electrons is set to unity. Thus, we conclude that the important
result of increasing anodic electron density with decreasing g dens is relatively insensitive to the
choice of g en; e.g. without knowing how to properly handle the electron energy boundary condition
at the interface, we can still reasonably conclude that a decreasing surface loss coefﬁcient will
signiﬁcantly increase the density of gas phase electron at the interface. The effect of varying g en

15

on the electron temperature gas phase proﬁle is shown in ﬁg. 11. Changes in the cathode and
bulk proﬁles are minimal. However, as one might intuitively expect, increasing energy reﬂection
increases the anodic electron temperature. An increase in electron temperature from the bulk to
the anode (observed for g en = 10−4) is more consistent with high current atmospheric argon PIC
simulations. [35]

These trends in the anode electron density and electron temperature at the anode could play an im-
portant role in more complex models that consider evaporation of H2O and dilute aqueous species.
The rates of reactions of electrons with these species will depend strongly on the electron den-
sity and the electron energy distribution. Different energy distributions might favor vibrational
excitation of H2O or dissociative attachment and the production of electronegative plasma species
like O− and OH−. The near interface gas chemistry will of course couple back into the liquid
phase chemistry. Future work with more complex models will investigate how changing g dens and
g en affects plasma and liquid chemistry. However, in order to limit the scope of possible results
and increase the predictive capability of such models, there must be more certainty in interfacial
parameters like g dens and in the interfacial energy dynamics (represented in this work by g en. De-
termination of such characteristics will likely require ﬁner scale simulations (molecular dynamics
for instance) and/or new experimental diagnostics that are capable of probing near-interface gas
dynamics.

4 Conclusions and Future Work

In this work it is found that varying the electron surface loss coefﬁcient at the plasma-liquid inter-
face can have signiﬁcant impacts on both the electron density and electron energy near-interface
characteristics. Future work will investigate how these variations could impact plasma chemistry
arising from the interaction of the near-interface gas electrons with volatile chemical species com-
ing from the liquid phase. Additionally the model will be expanded to multiple dimensions in the
hopes of reproducing the spreading of discharges over the liquid surface as a function of solution
conductivity. [1] Finally, ﬁner scale molecular simulations and/or experiments must be conducted
in order to understand the true physical behavior of electrons in the gas near the interface and to
accurately determine ﬂuid modelling parameters like g dens.

6 Appendix: Zapdos Code Description

Zapdos is built on top of the Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE)
[36] and libMesh [37] codes. MOOSE employs ﬁnite element methods (Continuous Galerkin,
Discontinuous Galerkin, or a combination) to solve fully coupled (or segregated through the use
of MultiApps) systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). After using FEM to discretize the
governing equations, MOOSE interfaces with the code PetSc [38] to solve the (non-)linear system
of algebraic equations via Newton’s method globalized through a line search:

˜J(~uk)~d u

k

= −~R(~uk)

~uk+1 = ~uk + s~d u

k

(17)

(18)

where ~uk is the solution vector for iterate k, ~R is the residual vector, and ˜J is the Jacobian matrix
formed by taking the derivatives of the residual vector with respect to the solution vector.[39] Equa-
tion (17) may be solved through either direct or iterative methods (usually GMRES with a variety
of preconditioning methods including incomplte lower-upper, block jacobi, additive Schwartz, (ge-
ometric) algebraic multigrid, etc.). Line search techniques (eq. (18)) are based on the methods in
[40]. For application programmers building on top of MOOSE, it is their responsibility to code
the residual and Jacobian statements that represent their physics. Residual statements are pieces
of the physical governing equations cast in the weak form. A maximally efﬁcient application code

20

in terms of computational time will have a complete and correct set of Jacobian statements cor-
responding to derivatives of the residuals with respect to the solution variables and will employ
the standard Newton method plus line search. If developer time is at a premium, some Jacobian
statements can be incomplete or omitted and a Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) method can
be employed in the stead of standard Newton. However, this comes at the cost of computational
efﬁency. The low-temperature plasma application Zapdos has been designed with the former strat-
egy in mind: complete and correct Jacobian statements so that standard Newton can be used. As
Zapdos is developed, new pieces of physics with new analytical Jacobians are compared against
PetSc Jacobians formed through ﬁnite differencing of the residual statements to ensure accuracy.

Zapdos partitions governing equation terms into individual pieces called kernels. Each kernel con-
tains the residual (simply the term cast in weak form) and the corresponding Jacobian statements.
Consider the drift ﬂux term in charged particle continuity equations: (cid:209)
· (−sgn(q)µ(cid:209) V ). After
casting into the weak form and taking the volume term, the corresponding Zapdos code looks like:

where _u is the solution variable that the kernel is applied to (could be any ion species or electron),
_phi and _test represent ﬁnite element shape functions (_phi = _test in all cases if using the same
order and family of shape functions for all solution variables), and _qp represent the positions
of quadrature points. By splitting governing equations in this way into individual terms/kernels,
code reproduction is kept at a minimum; analagous terms can be used in many different settings,
e.g. a “diffusion” term has the exact same mathematical form as a “conduction” or “viscosity”
term and so the same kernel code can be used for all three physics cases. Material properties like
mobilty and diffusivity are deﬁned in a materials ﬁle separated from the kernel code. Material

21

properties can be deﬁned as constants, as functions of the solution variables, or as properties to
be read from look-up tables. Through MOOSE, Zapdos provides an interface for linear, bilinear,
and spline interpolation of material properties. Boundary conditions are available in “Nodal” and
“Integrated” ﬂavors. Nodal boundary conditions are dirichlet like conditions that are enforced
strongly. Integrated boundary conditions are cast in the weak form and often arise from performing
integration by parts on divergence terms in the governing equations.

At the time of writing Zapdos has the necessary kernels and boundary conditions for solving gas
phase DC discharge ﬂuid models as well as conventional convection-diffusion-reaction equations
for dilute species in a ﬂuid (a future publication will demonstrate fully-coupled simulation of a DC
discharge impinging on a liquid surface). Another student is working on implementing RF plasma
simulation capabilities (for capacitively coupled plasmas this will only require slight modiﬁcation
of some boundary conditions; inductively coupled plasmas will require a little more work).

Zapdos solutions are output to an exodus ﬁle by default, although MOOSE provides varying levels
of support for some other output ﬁle formats (including full support for simple CSV). These exodus
ﬁles are then most commonly viewed graphically with either of the free and open source packages
Visit or Paraview. For users more programatically inclined, Paraview provides python tools that
enable the user to directly read the exodus ﬁle and create publication level plots in MatPlotLib with
a single script (as is done for most of the ﬁgures in this paper). For transient simulations, results for
any solution or auxiliary variable can be viewed while the calculation is on-line. Results are also
not lost if a solve is cancelled for any reason. These features enable quick convergence debugging
of a failing or failed solve.

gradients and coarse elsewhere.

The ﬁnal feature of Zapdos worth mentioning is the adaptive mesh reﬁnement inherited from
MOOSE. The user can choose from several different indicators, including the jump in a solution

gradient or laplacian between elements, for determing where mesh reﬁnement should take place.
Figures 12 and 13 show the propagation of a front through a domain in which the top and bottom
halves have different mobilities. The mesh tracks with the head of the front; the mesh is ﬁner in
regions of steeper gradients. This feature can be incredibly useful when trying to track ionization
bullets or similar phenomena.
