ABSTRACT

Aims. The formation and evolution of an Hα ﬁlament in active region (AR) 10953 is described.
Methods. Observations from the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) aboard the Hinode satellite starting from UT 18:09 on 27th April
2007 until UT 06:08 on 1st May 2007 were analysed. 20 scans of the 6302Å Fe I line pair recorded by SOT/SP were inverted using
the spatially coupled version of the SPINOR code. The inversions were analysed together with co-spatial SOT/BFI G-band and Ca II
H and SOT/NFI Hα observations.
Results. Following the disappearance of an initial Hα ﬁlament aligned along the polarity inversion line (PIL) of the AR, a new Hα
ﬁlament formed in its place some 20 hours later, which remained stable for, at least, another 1.5 days. The creation of the new Hα
ﬁlament was driven by the ascent of horizontal magnetic ﬁelds from the photosphere into the chromosphere at three separate locations
along the PIL. The magnetic ﬁelds at two of these locations were situated directly underneath the initial Hα ﬁlament and formed
orphan penumbrae already aligned along the Hα ﬁlament channel. The 700 G orphan penumbrae were stable and trapped in the
photosphere until the disappearance of the overlying initial Hα ﬁlament, after which they started to ascend into the chromosphere at
10 ± 5 m/s. Each ascent was associated with a simultaneous magnetic ﬂux reduction of up to 50% in the photosphere. The ascended
orphan penumbrae formed dark seed structures in Hα in parallel with the PIL, which elongated and merged to form an Hα ﬁlament.
The ﬁlament channel featured horizontal magnetic ﬁelds of on average 260 G at log(τ) = −2 suspended above the nearly ﬁeld-free
lower photosphere. The ﬁelds took on an overall inverse conﬁguration at log(τ) = −2 suggesting a ﬂux rope topology for the new Hα
ﬁlament. The destruction of the initial Hα ﬁlament was likely caused by the ﬂux emergence at the third location along the PIL.
Conclusions. We present a new interpretation of the Hα ﬁlament formation in AR 10953 whereby the mainly horizontal ﬁelds of
orphan penumbrae, aligned along the Hα ﬁlament channel, ascend into the chromosphere, forming seed fragments for a new, second
Hα ﬁlament. The orphan penumbral ﬁelds ascend into the chromosphere ∼9-24 hours before the Hα ﬁlament is fully formed.

1. Introduction
Solar Hα ﬁlaments are among the longest (Deslandres 1894;
Waldmeier 1938; Zirin & Tandberg-Hanssen 1960) and best
studied (see reviews by Hirayama 1985; Tandberg-Hanssen
1995; Mackay et al. 2010) objects in the Sun’s atmosphere. They
are easily identiﬁed as dark ﬁlaments on the disc (e.g. Lin et al.
2005) or as prominences suspended above the solar limb (e.g.
Okamoto et al. 2007) when the Sun is observed in a strong spec-
tral line such as Hα. The comparatively cool, dense material
making up the bulk of the Hα ﬁlament is prevented from im-
mediately returning to the photosphere by magnetic ﬁelds per-
vading it.

Photospheric magnetograms revealed that Hα ﬁlaments are
typically located along a polarity inversion line (PIL) (Babcock
& Babcock 1955) ﬂanked by kG magnetic ﬁeld concentrations
(MFCs). Running along the long axis of Hα ﬁlaments are typ-
ically hG horizontal ﬁelds (Leroy et al. 1983, 1984; Kuckein
et al. 2009, 2012a; Xu et al. 2012). Beginning with the earli-
est Hα ﬁlament models (Kippenhahn & Schl¨uter 1957), the Hα
ﬁlament’s material is proposed to reside in dips in the magnetic
ﬁeld connecting the opposite polarities on either side of the PIL.
The model by Kippenhahn & Schl¨uter (1957) and its various ex-
tensions by Malherbe & Priest (1983); Heinzel & Anzer (2001)
proposes a normal polarity conﬁguration, whereby the magnetic
ﬁeld lines connect the opposite polarities ﬂanking the PIL akin
to a potential ﬁeld conﬁguration. The inverse or O-loop con-
ﬁguration, suggested by Kuperus & Tandberg-Hanssen (1967)

& Kuperus & Raadu (1974), but see also Priest et al. (1989);
van Ballegooijen & Martens (1989) tends to be the favoured
conﬁguration given the variety of observations supporting it
(e.g. Bommier et al. 1994; Lites et al. 1995; Dere et al. 1999;
L´opez Ariste et al. 2006; Okamoto et al. 2008; Kuckein et al.
2012a), although observations in favour of the (Kippenhahn &
Schl¨uter 1957) model have been reported by Leroy et al. (1984).
However, complicated internal motions observed within Hα ﬁl-
aments appear to call for even more complicated models (e.g.
Schmieder et al. 1991; Berger et al. 2008; Sasso et al. 2011).

The formation process of Hα ﬁlaments is less well under-
stood. A large number of theoretical models of this process exist.
The surface models typically involve atmospheric reconnection
of already emerged ﬁelds brought about by shear ﬂows and/or
inﬂows along the PIL (e.g. van Ballegooijen & Martens 1989;
DeVore et al. 2005). Alternatively, sub-surface models employ
the emergence of new, twisted ﬂux ropes through the photo-
sphere and into the chromosphere to form a new Hα ﬁlament
(e.g. Rust & Kumar 1994; Low & Hundhausen 1995). A more
complete overview on these models is given in Mackay et al.
(2010).

Direct observations of Hα ﬁlament creation are compara-
tively rare. Gaizauskas et al. (1997, 2001) observed inﬂow mo-
tions of MFCs in magnetograms into a PIL over several days
and Wang & Muglach (2007) observed shearing in Hα ﬁbrils,
leading to Hα ﬁlament creation and supporting the surface-type
models. In contrast, Lites et al. (1995) and Okamoto et al. (2008,

1

D. Buehler, et al.: Formation of a solar Hα ﬁlament from orphan penumbrae

2009) observed the emergence of a ﬂux rope along a PIL also
leading to Hα ﬁlament creation and supporting the sub-surface
models. However, the Hα ﬁlament creation observed by Lites
et al. (1995) took place in conjunction with delta sunspots, which
are rarer than Hα ﬁlaments, whilst the ﬂux emergence observed
by Okamoto et al. (2008, 2009) failed to show any of the typical
ﬂux emergence signs (Cheung & Isobe 2014). The investigations
by Kuckein et al. (2012b) & Xu et al. (2012), whilst generally
supporting the rising ﬂux rope scenario, lacked the required tem-
poral resolution to unambiguously characterise the evolution of
their magnetic structures. The observations by Gaizauskas et al.
(1997, 2001); Wang & Muglach (2007) employed low resolution
data (1(cid:48)(cid:48) − 2(cid:48)(cid:48)) and the necessary shear ﬂows along the PIL have
so far never been directly observed during Hα ﬁlament creation.
Given the need for further and more detailed observations
on the creation of Hα ﬁlaments, we analysed active region (AR)
10953, which hosted two consecutive, well studied Hα ﬁlaments
(Okamoto et al. 2008, 2009; Wheatland & R´egnier 2009; Su
et al. 2009; Canou & Amari 2010). The description of the evolu-
tion and the formation process of the second Hα ﬁlament is the
aim of this paper.

2. Observations & Analysis
This investigation employs data sets recorded by the narrow-
band ﬁlter imager (NFI), the broad-band ﬁlter imager (BFI) and
the spectropolarimeter (SP), all of which are part of the Solar
Optical Telescope (SOT) (Tsuneta et al. 2008; Suematsu et al.
2008; Ichimoto et al. 2008; Shimizu et al. 2008) aboard the
Hinode satellite (Kosugi et al. 2007). The SOT was extensively
used to monitor the photospheric and chromospheric evolution
of AR 10953 at a high spatial and spectral resolution. The AR
was tracked from 27th April 2007 until 7th May 2007, which en-
compassed the AR’s passage across the solar disc. The PIL of the
AR hosted successive Hα ﬁlaments. Unfortunately, the pointing
of the SOT was such that beginning at the 1st of May the Hα
ﬁlament was largely outside the ﬁeld of view (FOV) so that data
sets of the AR recorded afterwards are not included in this in-
vestigation.

The SOT/SP records two magnetically sensitive photo-
spheric Fe I lines at 6302 Å with a spectral resolution of 30 mÅ.
At each slit position the four Stokes parameters I, Q, U and V
are recorded. The majority of the observations were performed
using the fast mode, which is characterised by an exposure time
of 1.6 s per slit position and eﬀective pixels size of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)32. Three
data sets at UT 09:00 & 15:00 on 28th April and UT 18:35 on
30th April were obtained in the normal mode, which has an ex-
posure time of 4.8 s per slit position and eﬀective pixel size of
0.(cid:48)(cid:48)16. Due to the diﬀerent spatial sampling and exposure times
both observation modes have a noise level of 1× 10−3 Ic. All the
SOT/SP data sets used in this investigation are listed in Tab. 1
and are typically 3 - 5 hours apart from each other. Each data
set was reduced using sp prep (Lites & Ichimoto 2013) and then
inverted using the SPINOR code (Frutiger et al. 2000).

The inversion procedure follows the 2D spatially coupled
inversion technique introduced by van Noort (2012), which
has subsequently been applied to many SOT/SP data sets
(Riethm¨uller et al. 2013; van Noort et al. 2013; Tiwari et al.
2013; Lagg et al. 2014; Buehler et al. 2015). The technique takes
into account the local image degradation caused by SOT/SP’s
point-spread-function (PSF) during the inversion procedure it-
self. Since the global straylight contribution in SOT/SP obser-
vations is below 10% (Danilovic et al. 2008; van Noort 2012),
the central part of the PSF accounts for the bulk of the expected

2

rms contrast in the observations. As a result the observed spectra
can be successfully described in terms of a single atmosphere
per pixel and the need to introduce a ﬁlling or straylight factor is
removed. Spectra of the photosphere routinely display both am-
plitude and area asymmetries in their Stokes parameters (Solanki
1993; Stenﬂo 2010; Viticchi´e & S´anchez Almeida 2011), which
are indicative of line-of-sight (LOS) gradients in the atmosphere.
The ﬁtted model atmospheres of the inversion could account for
these LOS gradients through the use of three nodes in optical
depth, at log(τ) = 0,−0.8 & − 2. At each node the atmospheric
parameters, the temperature, T, the magnetic ﬁeld, B, the LOS
ﬁeld inclination, γ, the LOS ﬁeld azimuth, φ, the LOS velocity,
v, and microturbulence, ξ, could be altered. Values belonging
to optical depths other than the three nodes were obtained from
spline interpolations through the three nodes. By solving the ra-
diative transfer equation using the STOPRO routines (Solanki
1987), which are part of the SPINOR code, synthetic Stokes
spectra of a given model atmosphere can be generated and com-
pared to observed spectra. Through the use of response func-
tions and a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, which minimises a
χ2 merit function, the atmospheric parameters of a pixel’s model
atmosphere can be iteratively ﬁtted until the synthesised spectra
closely match the observed ones.

All the LOS inclinations and LOS azimuths obtained from
the inversions were subsequently converted to local solar co-
ordinates and the 180◦ azimuth ambiguity was removed. The
azimuth ambiguity removal routine follows the principles out-
lined in Buehler et al. (2015) whereby the magnetic orientation
of canopy pixels at log(τ) = −2 of a MFC is resolved by relat-
ing them to the core pixels of the MFC under the assumption
that the magnetic ﬁeld is approximately divergence free. The
remaining pixels are then resolved by local dot products with
already azimuth resolved pixels. In regions with high magnetic
ﬁeld strengths such as a sunspot the jz component of the cur-
rent is additionally taken into account. Pixel with ﬁeld strengths
below 50 G were not resolved. The corrected inclinations and
azimuths are labelled Γ and Φ respectively. The zero velocity
was set by forcing the mean umbral LOS velocity to zero, which
required a correction of 230 ± 50 m/s for the various SOT/SP
data sets.
The spatial resolution of fast mode SOT/SP images is only
0.(cid:48)(cid:48)64, while an individual ﬂux tube in the form of a bright point
can have a width of only 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)15 (Lagg et al. 2010) or even less
(Riethm¨uller et al. 2014). As a result, the magnetic ﬁeld strength
values obtained from the inversions should be viewed as a lower
limit of the true values, in particular for smaller magnetic struc-
tures. However, this investigation focusses on magnetic ﬁelds
involved in the evolution of an Hα ﬁlament surrounded by an
extensive plage/pore region as well as a sunspot, all of which
are structures which are generally several times the spatial res-
olution limit of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)64 in size. Any ﬁne structure belonging to
these magnetic ﬁelds is, nonetheless, largely lost and will only
be lightly touched upon in the following sections. Finally, the
inversion results support and complement the co-temporal and
co-spatial SOT/BFI and SOT/NFI observations of the AR.

The BFI performed observations of the G-band at 4305 Å,
which forms in the photosphere, and Ca II H at 3968 Å, which
mainly depicts the upper photosphere due to the broadness of
the employed ﬁlter (Carlsson et al. 2007). The BFI observations
possess the highest angular resolution at 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)22. The NFI observed
the AR in the Hα line at 6563 Å with an angular resolution of
0.(cid:48)(cid:48)32. The Hα observations suﬀer from an air bubble, which ob-
scures and distorts part of the image and places an observable in-

tensity pattern across the remaining image. Fortunately, the Hα
ﬁlament investigated in this study was located far from the air
bubble, allowing its evolution to be monitored continuously. All
three channels performed observations of the AR with a cadence
of one image per minute starting at UT 11:39 on 28th April 2007
until UT 06:07 on 1st May 2007, except for small gaps of 15
minutes every 2 - 3 hours. All three channels were reduced us-
ing fg prep. The observations overlap with the SOT/SP scans
save for the initial two in Tab. 1. The BFI, NFI and SP observa-
tions were aligned to each other using a rigid alignment routine
available from the solarsoft package.

3. Results
A general impression of AR 10953’s evolution can be gained
from Fig. 1, which depicts the temperature at log(τ) = 0 of
four diﬀerent SOT/SP scans. At UT 11 on 28th April the AR
harbours a fully developed sunspot surrounded by pores and or-
phan penumbrae. By UT 02 on 1st May many of these surround-
ing structures have disappeared and the AR appears to have lost
some of its complexity. Three regions, enclosed by the boxes A,
B and C, undergo the greatest change in time and play a critical
role in the formation of the AR’s Hα ﬁlament.

The evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld strengths is shown in Fig.
2. The two rows indicate the ﬁelds at the upper two log(τ) nodes
set during the inversion. At UT 11 on 28th April regions A, B
and C all contain kG ﬁelds across all three log(τ) layers, which
match the locations of reduced temperature seen in Fig. 1. As the
three regions evolve, the kG ﬁelds give way to a more diﬀuse hG
ﬁeld (light blue colour in Fig. 2), which is prevalently situated in
the upper node at log(τ) = −2. It is nestled between the MFCs
aligned along the PIL and is suspended above the photosphere,
since the corresponding lower log(τ) layers are almost ﬁeld free.
Figure 2 also reveals that regions A, B and C do not evolve
simultaneously but separately. Region C is the ﬁrst to evolve and
by UT 18 on 28th April (column 2 Fig. 2) hosts a hG ﬁeld sus-
pended at log(τ) = −2. Regions A & B initially remain relatively
unchanged, but eventually follow suit and also host their sus-

pended hG ﬁeld by UT 11 on 29th April (column 3 Fig. 2), some
17 hours later. Note that, at this time the hG ﬁelds of the three
regions are still separated from each other by several kG MFCs
(e.g. −470X, −100Y). The separate hG ﬁeld regions continue to
expand (see column 4 Fig. 2) and by UT 13 on 30th April the hG
ﬁelds form a continuous channel.

Figure 3 displays the inclination of the magnetic ﬁelds at
log(τ) = −2, while the black contour lines encompass kG MFCs.
The presence of an extended plage region of opposite polarity to
the sunspot can be discerned from this ﬁgure. Regions A, B and
C are all placed on the PIL running through the AR (see white
line at e.g. UT 01 on 30th April in Fig. 3 for reference). Even
though the magnetic ﬁelds in regions A, B and C evolve in time,
the PIL is maintained throughout. Aligned along the PIL are
MFCs, which is characteristic for most Hα ﬁlament channels.
The MFCs on the sunspot side are, furthermore, aﬀected by the
Sunspot’s moat ﬂow, which carries new MFCs towards the PIL
(Okamoto et al. 2009; Vargas Dom´ınguez et al. 2012). The lower
row panels in Fig. 3 illustrate this behaviour. Whilst the MFCs
around the PIL contain predominantly vertical ﬁelds, the ﬁelds
on the PIL itself are predominantly horizontal, especially once
regions A, B and C have reduced in complexity. Furthermore,
the azimuthal orientation of this ﬁeld, displayed by the arrows in
Fig. 3, follows an inverse conﬁguration (i.e. the ﬁeld also points
from negative to positive polarity) at e.g. UT 01 on 30th April
once the three regions have merged.

The horizontal hG ﬁeld aligned along the PIL at UT 13 on
30th April in Figs. 2 & 3 indicates the presence of an Hα ﬁla-
ment suspended above the photosphere. The SOT/NFI observa-
tions displayed in Fig. 4 not only support this assertion, but also
reveal that the complex photospheric evolution seen in Figs. 1,
2 & 3 is mirrored in the chromosphere. The observations show
that a fully formed Hα ﬁlament was already present above the
PIL at UT 11:50 on 28th April, which is near the start of the
SOT/NFI observation run. Furthermore, the photospheric mag-
netic ﬁelds of regions A & B are situated directly underneath
the Hα ﬁlament, whereas region C is slightly oﬀset. The initial
Hα ﬁlament is stable until a series of small dynamic brightening
events rooted at region C (e.g. 45X, 20Y at UT 21:34, 21:50 on
28th April in Fig. 4) begin to erode it. The events manifest them-
selves in the form of intense brightenings lasting no longer than
two images (¡ 2 min), which are seen simultaneously in Hα and
Ca II H. They may be a manifestation of reconnection. By UT
00:22 on 29th April the initial overlying Hα ﬁlament has disap-
peared and given way to several disjointed dark fragments, lo-
cated at regions A, B and C. The azimuthal magnetic ﬁeld com-
ponent (see Fig. 3) is always orientated in parallel with these
fragments. The small fragments slowly elongate to coalesce into
a continuous Hα ﬁlament, by UT 20:04 on 29th April, a devel-
opment that is supported by the inversion results in Figs. 2 & 3.
The newly formed Hα ﬁlament then remains stable until at least
the 7th of May, although a few sporadic brightening events do
occur along the PIL.

The evolution of the PIL and the Hα ﬁlaments located within
it appears to be driven by the magnetic ﬁelds in regions A, B and
C. Region C appears to be responsible for the destabilisation
of the initial Hα ﬁlament as well as providing one of the seeds
from which the new Hα ﬁlament is formed. Regions A & B,
while comparatively passive at ﬁrst, also appear to be intimately
involved in the creation of the new Hα ﬁlament. Therefore, the
three regions will be examined more closely.

the distance to disc centre. The three boxes marked A, B & C enclose regions of rising ﬂux.

3.1. Region C

Region C is the southernmost region of the three and was out-
side the FOV of the SOT/BFI channels at all times. Due to the
continuous northward drift of the FOV of all SOT channels, the
majority of region C was also outside the FOV of the SOT/SP
and Hα channels by UT 09 on 30th April (see Figs. 2 & 3). The
ﬁrst SOT/SP scan at UT 18 on 27th April already shows the exis-
tence of the PIL, but contains no magnetic structure that can be
linked to the pore situated at the heart of region C at UT 11 on
28th April (see Fig. 1), suggesting that region C is composed of
freshly emerged ﬂux. The second SOT/SP scan at UT 09 on 28th

April hints that region C already contained a pore at that time,
however, a tracking error meant that the region was not scanned
in its entirety. Therefore, the emergence of the magnetic ﬂux of
region C into the photosphere is unfortunately not covered by
SOT.

The subsequent evolution of region C as seen by SOT/SP is
displayed in Fig. 5 and corresponds to SOT/SP scans 3 - 5 in
Tab. 1. At UT 11 on 28th April the temperature at log(τ) = 0
displays a dark pore at the centre of the FOV composed of kG
magnetic ﬁelds in all log(τ) layers. A somewhat less dark elon-
gated structure, around 6X, 5Y, is located immediately below it.

Fig. 2. Magnetic ﬁeld strengths obtained from the inversions. Each column corresponds to a separate SOT/SP scan, and the upper
and lower rows indicate the ﬁeld strengths at log(τ) = −2 & -0.8 respectively. The colour bar applies to all plots and the xy axes
indicate the distance to disc centre. The three white boxes are identical to those in Fig. 1.

The contour lines in Fig. 5 reveal that this structure is located
in between two kG magnetic ﬁeld patches of opposite polarity
and is itself host to horizontal ﬁelds of up to one kG. Over the
two subsequent SOT/SP scans, covering 7 hours, the two oppo-
site polarity kG patches drift apart from each other and reduce in
size. The magnetic ﬂux reduces by 50% in all log(τ) layers from
9 × 1019 Mx to 4.5 × 1019 Mx at log(τ) = −0.8. Simultaneously
the horizontal ﬁelds connecting the kG patches, indicated by the
arrows in Fig. 5, drop form ∼1 kG in all log(τ) layers to < 100
G in the lower two layers (see Fig. 2) leaving a canopy ﬁeld of
∼260 G at log(τ) = −2. This canopy ﬁeld persists in all subse-
quent observations (see Fig. 2).

At UT 15 on 28th April an upﬂow, co-spatial with the hor-
izontal magnetic ﬁelds (7X, 5Y in Fig. 5), can be seen between
the two separating polarities in log(τ) = −2. The upﬂows reach
a peak LOS velocity of 2 km/s. The conﬁguration of upﬂows
at the apex of rising magnetic ﬁelds together with downﬂows at
their foot points supports the rising ﬂux scenario. The dark ﬁb-
rils seen in Hα at UT 11 & 15 in Fig. 5 are generally orientated
perpendicular to the photospheric ﬁelds, but beginning at UT

upﬂows small ﬁbrils connecting the opposite kG polarities and
orientated in parallel with the photospheric ﬁeld can be spotted.
The photospheric ﬁelds and Hα ﬁbrils remain aligned for as long
as region C can be identiﬁed (see Figs. 2, 3 & 4).

Furthermore, the azimuthal orientation of region C’s mag-
netic ﬁelds after they rose into the chromosphere already display
an inverse conﬁguration at log(τ) = −2 at UT 03 on 29th April in
Fig. 3. Together with the average ﬁeld strength of 260 G and the
co-spatial and aligned dark ﬁbril seen at 55X, 15Y at the same
time in Fig. 4, reveal that region C alone already displays the
characteristics of the Hα ﬁlament that forms out of regions A,
B and C at UT 20:04 on 29th April. Potentially, magnetic ﬁelds
stemming from a small, compact region such as region C may
already be suﬃcient to form a small Hα ﬁlament.

3.2. Region B

Region B is the most striking and revealing region of the three.
Its initial photospheric composition is characterised by pores and
several elongated ﬁlamentary structures, which are reminiscent
of orphan penumbrae. They are identiﬁable at UT 11 on 28th
April in Fig. 1. All of these features are already fully formed in
the ﬁrst SOT/SP scan at UT 18 on 27th April, which indicates
that the emergence of region B’s magnetic ﬂux into the photo-

6

sphere occurred when the AR was still located on the far side of
the Sun.

From UT 11:39 on 28th April onwards region B was contin-
uously monitored by SOT/NFI and the two SOT/BFI channels.
The Hα images in Fig. 4 indicate that the photospheric magnetic
structures of region B are located directly underneath the initial
Hα ﬁlament. Whilst the initial Hα ﬁlament is in place the photo-
spheric magnetic structures of region B are very stable (see UT
11 & 18 on 28th April in Fig. 2). Once the initial Hα ﬁlament has
disappeared the photospheric composition of region B begins to

change according to Figs. 2 & 4. The G-band and Ca II H ob-
servations of region B support this assertion and a selection of
images of both channels is displayed in Fig. 6.

The images in Fig. 6 give an account of the photospheric evo-
lution of region B beginning just after the disappearance of the
initial overlying Hα ﬁlament. At UT 23:58 on 28th April both
channels observed a pore and several orphan penumbrae con-
necting opposite polarities, derived from co-temporal SOT/SP
observations. Over the following 8 hours the orphan penumbrae

become brighter and shorter before they disappear entirely leav-
ing only the pore. These orphan penumbrae were already identi-
ﬁable in the ﬁrst SOT/BFI images at UT 11:39 on 28th April and
the evolution of their G-band mean intensity is displayed in Fig.
7. The thick solid curve represents a 3 hour smoothing of the in-
dividual mean intensity measurements and testiﬁes to the initial
stability of the orphan penumbrae followed by a gradual bright-
ening. The dashed vertical line in the same ﬁgure marks the dis-
appearance of the initial overlying Hα ﬁlament. Therefore, Fig.

Buehler, et al.: Formation of a solar Hα ﬁlament from orphan penumbrae

7 indicates that the gradual evolution and disappearance of the
photospheric structure is triggered by a change in the overlying
chromosphere.

The individual mean intensity measurements shown by the
dots in Fig. 7 display a somewhat erratic behaviour, which
is principally caused by the continuous drift of the FOV of
SOT/BFI and causes the orphan penumbrae to be partially out-
side the FOV for short periods of time. The solid line centred at
0.62 Ic in Fig. 7 represents a 3 hour smoothing of the sunspot’s
disc-side penumbra’s mean intensity from the same G-band ob-
servations. As expected, the sunspot penumbra remains stable
through the observations and is considerably darker than the or-
phan penumbra in region B. The brightness diﬀerence appears
to be largely intrinsic, since no matter how the orphan penumbra
in region B is selected it is never as dark as the sunspot penum-
bra. The ﬁnal selection of region B’s orphan penumbra was per-
formed by drawing simple box around it, whose size is manu-
ally adjusted depending on the length and width of the structure.
Each G-band image was also normalised to its own quiet Sun
mean intensity to remove the limb darkening eﬀect. A similar
mean intensity evolution of the orphan penumbrae can also be
observed for the Ca II H images over the same time period.

The SOT/SP inversions compiled in Fig. 8 support and ex-
tend the impressions gained from Figs. 6 & 7 and detail the
evolution of region B as obtained from the inversion of SOT/SP
scans 6 - 11 in Tab. 1. The temperature plots at log(τ) = 0 in Fig.
8 contain the same orphan penumbra around 8X, 8Y. Just as in
Fig. 6, by UT 08 on 29th April the orphan penumbra is no longer
identiﬁable in the temperature plots in Fig. 8. Furthermore, the
pore located at the head of the orphan penumbra has also disap-
peared by UT 15 on 29th April. The number of kG features de-
creases sharply over the 18 hour period covered in Fig. 8 with the
consequent decrease in magnetic ﬂux plotted in Fig. 9. Whilst
the magnetic ﬂux is close to constant over the ﬁrst two time steps
when the initial overlying Hα ﬁlament was still intact, it rapidly
decreases following the ﬁlament’s disintegration. All the log(τ)
layers reveal a similar drop of ∼40 % in magnetic ﬂux over time
between UT 00 and UT 15 on 29th April.

The orphan penumbra, enclosed by a white box in Fig. 8,
contain generally sub-kG ﬁelds at all times, except for a few pix-
els at log(τ) = 0. For as long as the orphan penumbra is visible
in the log(τ) = 0 temperature plots, it contains sub-kG magnetic
ﬁelds across all log(τ) layers. In particular the ﬁelds at log(τ) = 0
& −0.8 closely follow the shape of the orphan penumbrae as seen
in the temperature. By UT 03 on 29th April the orphan penum-
bra has become somewhat shorter in length and this is reﬂected
in the magnetic ﬁelds in the lower two log(τ) layers. From UT
08 on 29th April onwards the magnetic ﬁeld has almost vacated
the lower two log(τ) layers and is predominantly situated in the
upper log(τ) layer. The change in the mean horizontal magnetic
ﬁeld strength of the pixels enclosed by the white box in Fig. 8
across all log(τ) layers is plotted in Fig. 9 as well. The mean hor-
izontal ﬁeld strength at log(τ) = −2, represented by the dashed
line in Fig. 9, settles at 260 G, forming a canopy over the lower
two log(τ) layers.

The magnetic ﬁeld inclinations in Fig. 8 demonstrate that
the orphan penumbra is composed of predominantly horizon-
tal ﬁelds, which connect opposite polarity kG MFCs. The nega-
tive polarity pore located at 5X, 12Y in Fig. 8 forms the head of
the orphan penumbrae, whilst its tail is formed by several small
MFCs located around 13X, 5Y. Once the overlying Hα ﬁlament
has disappeared the two opposite polarities move apart begin-
ning at UT 00 on 29th April. The separation of the polarities, also
seen in Fig. 6, suggests that the horizontal ﬁelds between them,

originally forming the ﬁelds of the orphan penumbra, are rising
into the chromosphere (as described in e.g. Strous et al. (1996);
Lites et al. (1998); Strous & Zwaan (1999) & Centeno (2012)).
Unlike region C, the rise of the orphan penumbrae in region B
does not cause a series of intermittent brightenings visible in the
Hα and Ca II H data sets.
The orientation of region B’s orphan penumbra relative to
the PIL (i.e. where Γ ∼ 90◦) undergoes a considerable evolution
over time. From Fig. 8 it is evident that the orphan penumbra,
while it is identiﬁable in the log(τ) = 0 temperature images (e.g.
UT 21 on 28th April), is aligned in parallel with the azimuthal
magnetic ﬁeld component. The azimuthal component in turn is

orientated in a normal conﬁguration with respect to the PIL (also
see Fig. 3). However, at UT 03 on 29th April and before, Figs.
2, 3 & 4 reveal that the orphan penumbra and its ﬁeld is also
already aligned in parallel to the initial Hα ﬁlament as well as
the Hα ﬁlament that forms by UT 20:04 on 29th April. The suc-
cessive SOT/SP scans depicted in Fig. 8 indicate the aforemen-

tioned loss of magnetic ﬂux over time (see also Fig. 9), which
causes the PIL in Fig. 8 to rotate in particular from UT 11 to 15
on 29th April. The azimuthal orientation of the orphan penum-
bra remains comparatively stable by comparison. Hence, the az-
imuthal orientation of the orphan penumbra relative to the PIL
appears to rotate by up to 90◦ over time. Note however, that the

Notes. Each value represents a spatial average over the structures.

at UT 03 on 29th April, which is also reﬂected in the area cov-
ered by the high LOS velocities. Whilst at log(τ) = 0 the ﬂow
often appears to stop short of reaching the opposite polarity kG
MFC, forming the tail of the orphan penumbrae, it does reach
the opposite MFC in the log(τ) = −2 layer. Therefore, the ﬂow
appears to be partially channelled above the photosphere during
the structure’s rise into the chromosphere, which may play a role
in supplying mass to the forming Hα ﬁlament. The ﬂow stops
abruptly in all the SOT/SP and SOT/BFI observations once the
orphan penumbra’s horizontal ﬁeld has vacated the lower two
log(τ) layers.

Table 2 provides a quantitive comparison between region B’s
orphan penumbra and a similarly orientated part of the sunspot’s
penumbra at UT 00 on 29th April (e.g. see −500X,−40Y at UT
03 on 29th April in Figs. 1 & 3). Each value represents a spa-
tial average over each structure as identiﬁed by the temperature
layer at log(τ) = 0. Table 2 reveals several quantitative diﬀer-
ences between region B and the sunspot penumbra. Region B is
consistently hotter by ∼200 K across all log τ layers, in line with
the persistent continuum intensity diﬀerence between the two
structures shown in Fig. 7. The magnetic ﬁeld strengths, too, are
lower in region B by ∼500 G. The LOS inclinations and azimuths
are very similar, as expected from the selection criteria for both
regions. The LOS velocities are of similar magnitudes, but the
log(τ) layer containing the highest average ﬂows does diﬀer.
Region B’s orphan penumbra features consistently faster ﬂows
in the upper two log(τ) layers when compared to the sunspot
penumbra and, together with the lower magnetic ﬁeld strengths,
might indicate that it is geometrically located higher in the solar
atmosphere than the sunspot penumbrae. Nonetheless, the clear
spine/inter-spine structure of the orphan penumbra in region B,
displayed in Fig. 6 and in all the inversion parameters listed in
Fig. 8 are in keeping with the standard penumbral ﬁlament de-
scribed by Tiwari et al. (2013).

For as long as the orphan penumbra in region B is identiﬁ-
able in the G-band and Ca II H images (see Fig. 6) both chan-
nels also reveal several bright spines separated by comparatively
darker inter-spines in the orphan penumbrae e.g. around 5X, 6Y

The LOS velocities in Fig. 8 indicate fast ﬂows in the or-
phan penumbra for as long as it is discernible in the log(τ) = 0
temperature layer. At all times and across all log(τ) layers the
ﬂows are co-spatial with the horizontal magnetic ﬁeld of the or-
phan penumbra. The horizontal magnetic ﬁeld at log(τ) = −2

at UT 23:58 on 28th April in Fig. 6. Along the spines small bright
points can be made out, which travel continuously from the pore
to the structure’s tail. Bright points seen in the G-band images
generally display the same behaviour except for bright points lo-
cated within 3” of the pore and at the head of the orphan penum-
bra, which show an apparent counterﬂow directed towards the
pore. In the Ca II H images these small bright points can be
traced at all times and travel the entire way to the tail’s opposite
polarity patch, which is situated at the lower edge of the FOV
and encompassed by the turquoise contour lines in Fig. 6. By
manually tracking 10 bright points they were found to have a
typical plane of the sky velocity of 1.7 km/s in the Ca II H im-
ages at UT 03:25 on 29th April (see Fig. 6). Furthermore, the
Ca II H observations support the suggestion made by Fig. 8 that
during the ﬁnal ascent stages at UT 03 on 29th April part of the
ﬂow in the orphan penumbrae appears to be channelled above
the photosphere.

Finally, an estimate of the rise speed of the orphan penumbra
through the photosphere can be obtained by combining the rise
time of ∼8 hours displayed in Fig. 7 and taking a value of ∼300
km for the thickness of the photosphere, which can be obtained
from contribution functions of the 6302 Å line pair calculated
by STOPRO. The resultant rise speed amounts to 10 ± 5 m/s.
Therefore, the LOS velocities in the orphan penumbrae primar-
ily depict a ﬂow orientated in parallel to the solar surface akin to
the Evershed ﬂow (Evershed 1909). A similar conclusion about
the ﬂow direction can be gleaned by combining the bright point
velocity in the Ca II H observations and the LOS velocity obser-
vations in Fig. 8.

3.3. Region A

Region A is by far the most complex region of the three. The
complexity is caused by the region’s vicinity to the sunspot, the
multitude of pores it harbours and the presence of a large orphan
penumbra. The characteristic features of region B can also be
observed for region A, some of them in a more striking fashion.
The orphan penumbra in region A also begins to evolve once
the initial Hα ﬁlament has disappeared, but it evolves somewhat
slower than region B’s orphan penumbra. Two SOT/SP scans of
region A revealing a similar evolutionary stage as region B at
UT 03 on 29th April are presented in Fig. 10. They correspond
to SOT/SP scans 10 and 11 in Tab. 1. The orphan penumbra is lo-
cated around pixel 20X, 25Y and the edge of the sunspot penum-
bra around 30X, 30Y in Fig. 10. The temperature and magnetic
ﬁeld contours reveal that part of the orphan penumbra in region
A is aligned in parallel to the Hα ﬁlament channel. The mag-
netic ﬁelds at log(τ) = −2 extend continuously from the orphan
penumbrae into the PIL, forming a hG ﬁeld canopy (see Fig.
2). The orphan penumbra, excluding the pores and MFCs, loses
30% of its magnetic ﬂux between UT 00 and UT 15 on 29th April
from 1.1 × 1020 Mx to 8 × 1019 Mx at log(τ) = −0.8. However,
an exact measure of the lost magnetic ﬂux due to the rise of the
orphan penumbra is diﬃcult to determine given that many MFCs
move considerable distances in the area of interest.

The orphan penumbra in Fig. 10 hosts fast LOS veloci-
ties, the majority of which are akin to the Evershed ﬂow in the
sunspot penumbra also displayed in the ﬁgure. Unlike region B’s
orphan penumbra, the sunspot penumbra and orphan penumbra
in Fig. 10 both display the fastest downﬂows at their tails across
all log(τ) layers. At log(τ) = −2 the downﬂows extend beyond
the orphan penumbrae’s log(τ) = 0 temperature boundary and
into the PIL. The extended outﬂow, located at 10X, 20Y, is trace-

turquoise to positive polarity kG ﬁelds at log(τ) = −0.8. The

able in both SOT/SP scans displayed in Fig. 10 and represents a
qualitatively similar case as the one seen at UT 03 on 29th April
in Fig. 8. Underneath the extended outﬂow a typical granulation
pattern can be seen in the lower log(τ) layers.

The extended outﬂow in region A at UT 11 on 29th April
appears to return to the photosphere along two positive polarity
MFCs situated at 5X, 4Y and 8X, 1Y. Around the two MFCs at
log(τ) = −2 the downﬂows are spatially extended, asymmetric
and face the outﬂow of the orphan penumbra of region A. They
are traceable in the lower two log(τ) layers as well and reach a
peak velocity of 6.6 km/s at log(τ) = 0. Also, the two MFCs
are ∼200 K hotter in the upper two log(τ) layers when compared
to other nearby MFCs. The Ca II H observations features per-
sistent brightenings at the location of the MFCs. In Fig. 10 and
the Ca II H observations the two MFCs are seen to recede away
from the orphan penumbra over time indicative of rising mag-
netic ﬁelds. The orphan penumbra’s outﬂow would, therefore,
cover a distance of ∼30” and ﬂow along the PIL. Both the ex-
tended outﬂow of the orphan penumbra is traceable in the Ca
II H observations of region A by the movement of small bright
points. The extended outﬂows appear to be a characteristic prop-
erty of ascending orphan penumbrae.

Buehler, et al.: Formation of a solar Hα ﬁlament from orphan penumbrae

29th April 2007 in AR 10953 is driven by the rise of horizontal
magnetic ﬁelds from the photosphere into the chromosphere. In
this section we compare and contrast our ﬁndings to the litera-
ture.

The investigation by Okamoto et al. (2008) employed Milne-
Eddington inversions of SOT/SP data sets 10, 11, 12, 14, 17 and
20 from Tab. 1, to infer the rise of a helical ﬂux rope along the
PIL of AR 10953. In particular, the authors focussed on a FOV
encompassing region B and parts of region C. According to the
employed SOT/SP data sets the emergence is proposed to occur
from UT 11 on 29th April until UT 02 on 1st May. However, the
horizontal magnetic ﬁelds in both regions rose into the chromo-
sphere before UT 11 on 29th April, some 11 hours earlier for
region B and 24 hours for region C (see Figs. 5 & 8). The Hα
ﬁlament, seeded by the horizontal magnetic ﬁelds of regions A,
B and C, reformed by UT 20:04 on 29th April (see Fig. 4), mak-
ing the emergence time-line proposed by Okamoto et al. (2008)
irreconcilable with both the SOT/SP and SOT/NFI observations.
The helical ﬂux rope emergence proposed by Okamoto et al.
(2008) is supposed to occur simultaneously along the entire PIL,
whilst leaving no discernible sign in the continuum images. Flux
emergences of order of 1 × 1019 Mx or more typically produce
elongated granules (Centeno 2012; Vargas Dom´ınguez et al.
2014) or dark ﬁlamentary structures (Strous et al. 1996; Lites
et al. 1998; Strous & Zwaan 1999; Kubo et al. 2003) visible
in the continuum, which were not reported by Okamoto et al.
(2008) over the proposed time frame. Flux emergence even at the
smallest scales (Centeno et al. 2007; Danilovic et al. 2010) al-
ways entails an increase in magnetic ﬂux, which is not supported
by the SOT/SP observations in Sect. 3 nor by SoHO/MDI obser-
vations of AR 10953 (Vargas Dom´ınguez et al. 2012). In ad-
dition, magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of ﬂux rope
emergence reveal that the magnetic ﬁeld emerges in a piece-
meal fashion and at several locations, after it has been distorted
by and subjected to the solar convection (Cheung et al. 2007,
2008, 2010; Mart´ınez-Sykora et al. 2008; Stein & Nordlund
2012). MHD simulations, where a horizontal ﬂux rope emerged
along the entire length of the simulation box, still displayed an
initial increase in magnetic ﬂux and deformations in the gran-
ules (Yelles Chaouche et al. 2009; MacTaggart & Hood 2010).
Regions A, B and C all contain structures visible in the contin-
uum typical of ﬂux emergence. They may represent the individ-
ual ﬂux emergence sites of a larger connected ﬂux system rising
through the photosphere.
Okamoto et al. (2008) observed a rotation in the magnetic
ﬁeld’s azimuthal direction with respect to the PIL of almost ∼50◦
from UT 11 on 28th April until UT 02 on 1st May. The ﬁeld ap-
pears to turn from an initially normal to ﬁnally an inverse con-
ﬁguration, even though the horizontal magnetic ﬁelds of both
region B and C have already risen into the chromosphere by that
time. The observed azimuth rotation is, therefore, a spurious ef-
fect brought about by the decay of magnetic ﬂux in region B,
which continued for some time after the horizontal ﬁeld’s as-
cend (see Fig. 9). The decay of ﬂux locally eﬀected a rotation of
the PIL itself rather than in the azimuth of the magnetic ﬁeld (see
UT 11 & 15 on 29th April in Fig. 8). Furthermore, the azimuthal
orientation of region C’s horizontal magnetic ﬁelds, which as-
cended into the chromosphere some 24 hours before UT 11 on
28th April (see Fig. 2 & 5), are displayed in the lower right hand
corner of Fig. 2’s FOV in Okamoto et al. (2008). They exhibit an
inverse conﬁguration throughout the time-line used by Okamoto
et al. (2008), which deﬁes their proposed scenario.

The sliding door mechanism, a widening followed by a nar-
rowing of the PIL, was proposed by Okamoto et al. (2008) as

12

evidence and photospheric signature for a magnetic ﬂux rope
that rises through the photosphere and into the corona. It occurs
at the same time as the azimuth rotation. Since our investigation
uses the same SOT/SP data sets, the sliding door mechanism can
also be seen in, for example, Fig. 3. However, in light of the ev-
idence presented in Sect. 3, the sliding door mechanism cannot
be a sign of ﬂux emergence. It appears to be a combination of
ﬂux decay (see Figs. 3, 8 & 9), which caused a widening of the
PIL, and the continuous moat ﬂow around the sunspot (see Fig.
3 & Okamoto et al. (2009); Vargas Dom´ınguez et al. (2012)),
which slowly pushed new MFCs into the PIL, hence causing it
to narrow. In the Ca II H observations the widening of the PIL is
seen as a growing dark area (see Fig. 1 in Okamoto et al. (2009)),
in line with a decay of kG MFCs. The subsequent narrowing of
the PIL manifests itself by a reduction of the dark area, by en-
croaching bright kG MFCs. The narrowing of the PIL (see Fig.
1 in Okamoto et al. (2009)) is greatest at the sunspot-facing side
of the PIL in keeping with a moat ﬂow-aided replenishment of
MFCs to the PIL.
The average photospheric magnetic ﬁeld strength of 260 G
at log(τ) = −2 in the ﬁlament channel at UT 20:04 on 29th April
(see Fig. 4), when the new Hα ﬁlament has formed, is consistent
with previous such measurements (Lites 2005; Okamoto et al.
2008; Lites et al. 2010; Xu et al. 2012; Sasso et al. 2014). At
several locations within the PIL higher ﬁelds strengths of up
to 800 G at log(τ) = −2 can be observed, which appear to be
somewhat short lived, since they can never be observed at the
same place in consecutive SOT/SP scans. Similarly high mag-
netic ﬁeld strengths in Hα ﬁlaments have been previously re-
ported both in chromosphere (Kuckein et al. 2009; Sasso et al.
2011) and photosphere (Kuckein et al. 2012a).
The Hα ﬁlament created by UT 20:04 on 29th April coincides
with horizontal magnetic ﬁelds at log τ = −2, whose azimuthal
component is predominantly aligned in parallel with the PIL, but
also appears to point from negative to positive magnetic polar-
ity (see Fig. 3). This highly non-potential conﬁguration of the
azimuthal magnetic ﬁeld component is commonly referred to as
an inverse conﬁguration, which has also been noted by Okamoto
et al. (2008) for the same Hα ﬁlament and has been observed
in many other cases (e.g. Lites 2005; L´opez Ariste et al. 2006;
Kuckein et al. 2012a). The inverse conﬁguration has been com-
monly interpreted as the photospheric observable of a chromo-
spheric horizontal ﬂux rope (e.g. Priest et al. 1989).

Kuckein et al. (2012a) observed orphan penumbrae aligned
in parallel to the Hα ﬁlament channel hosting an Hα ﬁlament at
various times. The supersonic downﬂow velocities located at the
edges of their orphan penumbrae (Kuckein et al. 2012b), appear
to be akin to the high downﬂows seen in region A at the tails of
the orphan penumbra and sunspot penumbra (see Fig. 10). The
orphan penumbrae are interpreted as parts of an extremely low
lying ﬁlament trapped in the photosphere. Although their orphan
penumbrae also subsequently disappear, it is unclear from the
available observations, whether they played a similar role as the
orphan penumbrae described in Sect. 3.

Region C (see Fig. 5) displays properties akin to a rising
loop system (Solanki et al. 2003; Lagg et al. 2004; Xu et al.
2010) during its initial rise into the chromosphere. The brighten-
ing events leading to the eventual disappearance of the initial Hα
ﬁlament (see Fig. 4), suggests an interaction and possible recon-
ﬁguration of the pre-existing chromospheric ﬁelds and the rising
ﬁelds (Manchester et al. 2004; Archontis et al. 2013). However,
regions B and A do not show similar brightening events and in-
stead the photospheric observations (see Figs. 8 & 10) indicate
that the orphan penumbra wholly rises into the chromosphere.

D. Buehler, et al.: Formation of a solar Hα ﬁlament from orphan penumbrae

The investigations by Guglielmino et al. (2014) & Zuccarello
et al. (2014) analysed orphan penumbrae similar to regions A
and B and concluded that they are a manifestation of emerged
Ω loops, which are trapped in the photosphere. The evolution of
region B in particular both supports and complements their ﬁnd-
ings. The orphan penumbra in region B is stable for at least 12
hours, whilst located underneath the initial Hα ﬁlament. Once
the overlying Hα ﬁlament and, presumably, most of its hori-
zontal magnetic ﬁeld have disappeared the orphan penumbra
can no longer be maintained in the photosphere and begins to
ascend (see Fig. 7). Furthermore, the sunspot penumbra for-
mation process studied by Shimizu et al. (2012); Rezaei et al.
(2012); Lim et al. (2013) & Jurˇc´ak et al. (2014a) indicates that
sunspot penumbra formation only sets in after a suﬃcient hor-
izontal magnetic ﬁeld has been established within the overly-
ing chromosphere. We speculate that there is a similar need for
strong overlying chromospheric ﬁelds to form and maintain or-
phan penumbrae.

Jurˇc´ak et al. (2014b) performed a comparison between or-
phan and sunspot penumbrae and found many qualitative simi-
larities, but, like region B, the orphan penumbrae featured higher
intensities and higher Evershed-like velocities (see Tab. 2). The
orphan penumbrae studied by Jurˇc´ak et al. (2014b) submerged
over time unlike the orphan penumbrae in regions A and B,
which ascended into the chromosphere. Sub-photospheric pro-
cesses are likely responsible for this divergent evolution.

Delta sunspots are often associated with producing and host-
ing Hα ﬁlaments (Tanaka 1991; Gaizauskas et al. 1994; Leka
et al. 1996; Lites & Low 1997). The penumbra between the
two opposite polarity umbrae is usually aligned in parallel to
the PIL. Their large size allows a detailed analysis of their hor-
izontal ﬁelds even when only a spatial resolution of 1(cid:48)(cid:48) is avail-
able. Lites et al. (1995) observed the emergence and decay of
a delta sunspot, which was accompanied by the formation of
an Hα ﬁlament. The observations were interpreted as an ascent
of horizontal ﬁelds from the photosphere into the chromosphere,
thereby forming an Hα ﬁlament. The evolution of the whole sys-
tem shares many analogies with regions A, B and C such as,
penumbra aligned with the PIL, persistent high/supersonic LOS
velocities in the penumbra (Mart´ınez Pillet et al. 1994), mag-
netic ﬂux decay during and after the ascend of the horizontal
ﬁelds, little ﬂaring activity during the ascent, and a remaining
Hα ﬁlament after large photospheric structures have been largely
reduced to plage MFCs. The qualitative similarities between the
results in Sect. 3 and those of Lites et al. (1995) suggest that our
observations may represent a scaled down version of the same
overall process (Rust & Kumar 1994).

Martin (1990) proposed a series of six conditions, which
would automatically lead to the creation of an Hα ﬁlament. The
Hα ﬁlament formation described in Sect. 3 supports the condi-
tions proposed by her, although the original conditions did not
include rising/emerging ﬂux. The AR features a PIL that exists
throughout the entire observation runs and supports an overly-
ing coronal arcade. The coronal arcade has not been shown ex-
plicitly here, but has been independently observed and extrap-
olated by De Rosa et al. (2009). It has also been extrapolated
by Wheatland & R´egnier (2009). The magnetic ﬁelds within the
PIL are transverse in the photosphere (see Fig. 3) and the initial
Hα ﬁlament as well as the individual fragments, which precede
the fully formed Hα ﬁlament, are all aligned parallel to the PIL
(see Fig. 4), in accord with Martin (1990). The two key proposed
photospheric observables leading to Hα ﬁlament creation, are a
continuous advection of small MFCs into the PIL (Gaizauskas
et al. 1997, 2001) and their cancellation presented as ﬂux de-

cay (Lites et al. 1995). Whilst the PIL in AR 10953 experi-
ences a continuous advection of fresh MFCs into the PIL by the
sunspot’s moat ﬂow (Okamoto et al. 2009; Vargas Dom´ınguez
et al. 2012), the magnetic structures in regions A, B, and C in-
volved in the formation of the Hα ﬁlament were already present
before the start of the observation runs. The photospheric ﬂux
decay, however, is observed for all three regions and in keeping
with Martin (1990). Since the conditions proposed by Martin
(1990) were based on low resolution (1(cid:48)(cid:48) − 2(cid:48)(cid:48)) ﬁltergram data
and LOS magnetograms, we can add to the proposed conditions
that the ﬂux decay is, at least in this case, initially accompanied
by rising horizontal magnetic ﬁelds. Two of the three additional
criteria added by Martin (1998) can be veriﬁed in our observa-
tions as well. The SOT/NFI Hα and SOT/BFI Ca II H obser-
vations show mass motions along the Hα ﬁlament and inverse
magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration in the PIL in the SOT/SP scans sug-
gests the existence of helicity in the Hα ﬁlament. Barbs (Martin
et al. 1992; Bernasconi et al. 2005; Lin et al. 2008) in Hα were
not detected in our observations.

5. Conclusion
The polarity inversion line (PIL) of active region (AR) 10953
was observed using Hinode SOT/SP scans, SOT/BFI G-band and
Ca II H and SOT/NFI Hα observations covering a time span
starting at UT 18:09 on 27th April 2007 and lasting until UT
06:08 on 1st May 2007.

The SOT/NFI Hα observations revealed an initial Hα ﬁla-
ment over the PIL, which eventually disappeared by UT 00:22
on 29th April 2007 following a ﬂux emergence at designated re-
gion C. A new Hα ﬁlament formed along the PIL by UT 20:04
on 29th April 2007. The formation process was driven by the
rise of horizontal magnetic ﬁelds from the photosphere into the
chromosphere at three separate locations along the PIL labelled
regions A, B and C. Several dark fragments, co-spatial with the
risen horizontal ﬁelds of regions A, B and C, were detected in the
SOT/NFI Hα observations, which eventually expanded to form
a new continuous Hα ﬁlament. The rise of the horizontal ﬁelds
from the photosphere into the chromosphere was largely com-
plete by UT 11 on 29th April 2007, some 9-24 hours before the
full formation of the Hα ﬁlament in the SOT/NFI Hα observa-
tions.

The initial emergence of regions A, B and C into the photo-
sphere could not be observed, since regions A and B had already
emerged when AR 10953 appeared on the east limb and region
C’s emergence was not seen due to observational gaps on the
27th of April 2007. Regions A and B were situated directly under-
neath the initial overlying Hα ﬁlament, which essentially trapped
the regions’ magnetic ﬁelds in the photosphere. The horizontal
ﬁelds, whilst trapped in the photosphere, took on the appearance
of orphan penumbrae exhibiting Evershed-like ﬂows. Once the
overlying Hα ﬁlament had disappeared, the orphan penumbrae
became unstable and rose into the chromosphere forming seed
fragments for the new Hα ﬁlament. Furthermore, the horizon-
tal ﬁelds in the orphan penumbrae in all regions were already
aligned along the same axis as both Hα ﬁlaments whilst trapped
in the photosphere.
The largely horizontal ﬁelds of the orphan penumbrae rise
into the chromosphere ∼9-24 hours before the Hα ﬁlament re-
constitutes itself. Based on the results presented here, we pro-
pose that, at least for some Hα ﬁlaments, orphan penumbrae,
already aligned in parallel with the Hα ﬁlament channel prior to
Hα ﬁlament formation, play a key role in producing it.
