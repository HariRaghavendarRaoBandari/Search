It is shown that a convex combination of two non-Markovian evolutions may lead to Markovian
semigroup. This shows that convex combination of quantum evolutions displaying nontrivial memory
eﬀects may result in a perfectly memoryless evolution.

Introduction – A general quantum evolution is rep-
resented by a dynamical map Λ(t),
a family of
completely positive and trace-preserving maps such that
ρ → ρ(t) = Λ(t)ρ, where ρ(t) denotes the density opera-
tor at time ‘t’ [1]. One usually assumes that Λ(t) satisﬁes
time-local master equation

i.e.

Λ(t) = L(t)Λ(t) ,

(1)
where the time-local generator L(t) has the following
well-known form
L(t)ρ = −i[H(t), ρ]

with the time dependent Hamiltonian H(t) and time
dependent dissipative part governed by time dependent
rates γα(t) and noise operators Vα(t). Recently a lot of
attention was devoted to the analysis of Markovianity of
quantum evolution represented by Λ(t) (see recent review
papers [2, 3]). Let us recall that Λ(t) is called divisible
(or CP-divisible) if

Λ(t) = V (t, s)Λ(s),

(3)
and V (t, s) is completely positive for all t ≥ s [4, 5]. This
property is fully characterized by the time-local genera-
tor: Λ(t) is CP-divisible if and only if γα(t) ≥ 0 for all
t ≥ 0. One of the approaches to quantum Markovianity
states that quantum evolution is Markovian iﬀ the cor-
responding dynamical map Λ(t) is CP-divisible [4, 5]. A
slightly weaker notion of Markovianity was proposed in
[6]. The advantage of BLP approach [6] is an operational
characterization based on the following deﬁnition: Λ(t)
is Markovian if for any ρ1 and ρ2

||Λ(t)[ρ1 − ρ2]||1 ≤ 0,
d
dt
√
where ||X||1 = Tr
X†X denotes the trace norm of X.
In this paper we attribute Markovianity to the notion of

(4)

CP-divisibility. However, the main example we use to
illustrate the paper does not distinguish between these
two notions.

Convex combination of Markovian evolutions – Note
that if L1(t) and L2(t) are Markovian generators then
α1L1(t) + α2L2(t) is again Markovian generator for ar-
bitrary α1, α2 ≥ 0. Hence Markovian generators deﬁne a
convex set (actually a convex cone) in the space of all ad-
missible time-local generators (2). It is no longer true on
the level of dynamical maps, i.e.
if Λ1(t) and Λ2(t) are
Markovian (i.e. CP-divisible), then α1Λ1(t) + α2Λ2(t)
needs not be CP-divisible [4]. A simple example illus-
trating that the space of CP-divisible maps is not con-
vex was recently provided in [7]: consider two Markovian
semigroups generated by
[σ1ρσ1 − ρ]

[σ2ρσ2 − ρ] ,

Clearly Λ(t) is a legitimate dynamical map but it is not
CP-divisible. Indeed, the corresponding time-local gen-
erator reads

L(t)ρ =

γk(t)[σkρσk − ρ],

where

and evidently leads to non-Markovian evolution due to
γ3(t) < 0. This generator was analyzed in [8] as an ex-
ample of eternal non-Markovianity. This simple exam-
ple shows that convex combination of Markovian evolu-
tions (even semigroups!) might lead to legitimate non-
Markovian evolution. Interestingly, this example may be
easily generalized for qudit systems [7].

Convex combination of non-Markovian evolutions – In
the present paper we provide a simple example show-
ing that a convex combination of two non-Markovian
evolution may lead to Markovian semigroup. Consider
a quantum channel E for a qudit system which deﬁnes
a projector, that is, E 2 = E. A typical example is a
channel which maps arbitrary state ρ into a ﬁxed state
ω, that is, Eρ = ωTrρ.
I then E is a com-
pletely depolarizing channel. Taking an orthonormal ba-
sis {|1(cid:105) . . . ,|d(cid:105)} in Cd one may deﬁne another CPTP pro-
k=1 |k(cid:105)(cid:104)k|ρ|k(cid:105)(cid:104)k|. Now, for arbitrary
CPTP projector E let us consider the following Marko-
vian generator

jector via Eρ = (cid:80)d

We show that for a given γ > 0 one can ﬁnd time depen-
dent γ1(t) and γ2(t) such that the following Markovian
semigroup

Λ(t) = eγLt = e−γt1l + [1 − e−γt]E,

may be constructed as a convex combination

Λ(t) = pΛ1(t) + (1 − p)Λ2(t),

with
Λk(t) = exp(Γk(t)L) = e−Γk(t)1l + [1 − e−Γk(t)]E,

and Γk(t) = (cid:82) t

Λ2(t) is Markovian which means that γk(t) (cid:3) 0.

[0, 1]. One has the following relation

p e−γtg(t) and hence

Let µ1(t) = 1

µ2(t) = e−γt 1 − g(t)

.

The initial condition Λk(0) = id implies µ1(0) = µ2(0) =
1, hence g(0) = p. Moreover, the constraint 0 < µ1(t) ≤
1 implies 0 < g(t) ≤ p. Now, to satisfy 0 < µ2(t) ≤ 1 let
us consider the following g(t): g(t) = p for t ∈ [0, t∗] and
p(t) ∈ [0, p] for t > t∗, where t∗ is deﬁned via the relation

which implies t∗ = − 1

and

i.e. capacity monotonically decreases. For depolarising
channels one may easily evaluate channel capacity [10]:

4 . The black line corresponds to Markovian

semigroup while the dashed (red) and the dotted (green) are channel
capacities for non-Markovian dynamics Λ1(t) and Λ2(t) respectively.
In the green, we may clearly observe nonmonotonic behaviour. In the

upper right corner we may observer nonmonotonicity of Λ2(t) for
t ∈ (3, 4). Therefore, both of Λ1(t) and Λ2(t) are non-Markovian.

The corresponding local depolarizing rates read

γ1(t) = γ − ˙g(t)
g(t)

, γ2(t) = γ +

˙g(t)
1 − g(t)

and hence for t ≤ t∗ one has γ1(t) = γ2(t) = γ. As an
example let us consider

g(t) = p(cid:8)1 − ε sin2(γ[t − t∗])H(t − t∗)(cid:9) ,

(15)

4 and p = 3

where H(t) denotes the Heaviside step function, and 0 <
ε < 1. The corresponding local depolarizing rates for
γ = 1, ε = 3
4 are displayed in Fig. 1. It is
evident that both γ1(t) and γ2(t) become negative for
some time intervals and hence neither Λ1(t) nor Λ2(t)
is CP-divisible. It is worth stressing that manipulation
of parameters γ, ε and p can gives us diﬀerent types of
behaviour, from CP-divisible for both Λ1(t) and Λ2(t) to
non-divisible for either or both of Λ1(t) and Λ2(t).

Non-Markovianiny of quantum evolution represented
by Λ(t) may be also analyzed in terms of channel capacity
[9]. If Λ(t) is CP-divisible then

C(Eλ) = ln d − Smin(Eλ),

displays highly non-Markovian behaviour.

Semi-Markov evolution – Quantum evolution gener-
ated by the time-local generator L(t) = γ(t)[E − 1l], with
E being a CPTP projector may be equivalently described
in terms of non-local memory kernel
K(t) = k(t)[E − 1l],

(18)

for some memory function k(t) [11, 12]. The correspond-
ing non-local master equation

gives rise to the following solution

Laplace transform. One calls Λ(t) semi-Markov if f (t) ≥
0 f (τ )dτ ≤ 1. In this case f (t) plays the role of
0 f (τ )dτ is in-
terpreted as so-called survival probability. Interestingly,
it is well known that in the class (20) the evolution Λ(t)
is semi-Markovian if and only if it is Markovian (CP-
divisible) [11]. Moreover, Λ(t) deﬁned by (20) deﬁnes
a semigroup iﬀ f (t) = γe−γt. Our example shows that
convex combination of two evolutions which are not semi-
Markov, i.e. f1(t), f2(t) (cid:3) 0, and hence non-Markovian,
may results in Markovian semigroup:

pf1(t) + (1 − p)f2(t) = γe−γt,

(22)

for t ≥ 0. Note, that (22) reproduces (12), that is,
fk(t) = γµk(t).

Conclusions — A set of Markovian (CP-divisible) evo-
lutions is not convex. It is shown that a convex combina-
tion of two non-Markovian evolutions may lead to Marko-
vian semigroup. Similarly, using memory kernel master
equation we shown that convex combination of quantum
evolutions which are not semi-Markov (and hence non-
Markovian) may result in Markovian semigroup. This
shows that convex combination of quantum evolutions
displaying nontrivial memory eﬀects may kill all memory
eﬀects and result in a perfectly memoryless evolution.
