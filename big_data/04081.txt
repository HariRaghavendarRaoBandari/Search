The surface of a 3D topological insulator is described by a helical electron state with the electron’s
spin and momentum locked together. We show that in the presence of ferromagnetic ﬂuctuations the
surface of a topological insulator is unstable towards a superconducting state with unusual pairing,
dubbed Amperian pairing. The key idea is that the dynamical ﬂuctuations of a ferromagnetic layer
deposited on the surface of a topological insulator couple to the electrons as gauge ﬁelds. The
transverse components of the magnetic gauge ﬁelds are unscreened and can mediate an eﬀective
interaction between electrons. There is an attractive interaction between electrons with momenta in
the same direction which makes the pairing to be of Amperian type. We show that this attractive
interaction leads to a p-wave pairing instability of the Fermi surface in the Cooper channel.

Introduction.— It is known that the Coulomb inter-
action in normal metals is usually screened by electrons
leading to short-ranged and momentum independent in-
teractions, which gives rise to conventional Fermi liquid
theory [1, 2]. The current-current magnetic interaction
between electrons, where the interaction is mediated by
exchange of transverse photons, however, remains un-
screened. Due to the interaction of the gapless bosonic
modes with fermions, nonanalytic corrections arise in
various physical quantities which clearly point to non-
Fermi liquid behavior [3, 4]. The eﬀect is purely relativis-
tic and is proportional to (vF /c)2, where vF is the Fermi
velocity of electrons and c is speed of light. Hence, the
corresponding bare interaction is comparatively smaller
than coupling constants.

While the relevance of transverse photons in normal
metals and their physical signatures are parametrically
small, the search for nonphoton mediated current-current
interactions has been extended to other systems such as
U(1) gauge ﬁelds in the spin liquid description of the
Mott phase of organic compounds [5, 6], a doped Mott in-
sulator [7] and the Halperin-Lee-Read state [8]. The nor-
mal state resistivity of a doped Mott insulator exhibits
a T 4/3 temperature dependence [9] and a T 2/3 contribu-
tion to the speciﬁc heat [10, 11] in the presence of the
U(1) gauge ﬂuctuations, which manifestly deviates from
the Fermi liquid. It was also shown that the U(1) gauge
ﬂuctuations can induce a new mechanism for pairing of
the spinons in a gapless spin liquid, so-called Amperian
pairing [12, 13] with a possible application to the pseu-
dogap phase of cuprate superconductors [14].

Given the maturity of heterostructure materials syn-
thesis and recent progress in topological insulators, in
this letter we propose a realistic system where the inter-
action between the fermions and gapless bosons can be
engineered to realize an eﬀective fermion-gauge theory
and an Amperian superconductor. The system is made
of a ferromagnetic layer deposited on the surface of a

3D topological insulator (TI) [15, 16] such as Bi2Te3 and
Bi2Se3. The surface state consists of a single helical Dirac
cone [17–20], where the electron spin and momentum are
locked together, aﬀecting the transport phenomena and
collective excitations [21, 22].

Some previous works have focused on the eﬀect of
static magnetic ﬂuctuations and textures [23–30] (see also
Refs. [31, 32] for an exception, where a dynamical gap
opening at the Dirac node is inversigated), we consider
the eﬀect of dynamical magnetic ﬂuctuations, i.e.
the
magnons, on a doped Dirac cone. We will show that the
latter have profound eﬀects on helical states. Here is a
summary of our results: (i) transverse magnetic ﬂuctua-
tions are unscreened and mediate an eﬀective interaction
between electrons; (ii) the eﬀective interaction is singular
at small frequency and momentum transfer and leads to
non-Fermi liquid behavior at very low energies; (iii) the
eﬀective interaction has an Amperian form: it is attrac-
tive between electrons near the Fermi surface moving in
the same direction; (iv) the attractive interaction leads
to a pairing instability of the Fermi surface, dubbed Am-
perian pairing.

Model.— Consider a hybrid system of a ferromagnet
with spin density ρs and the surface of TI as shown in Fig.
1(a). The continuum action of a quantum ferromagnet
with local moments S = Sn is given by [33]

Here, κ = JSa2

coupling and a0 is the lattice spacing. We use κ to deﬁne
magnon mass ms via κ = 1/2ms ( = 1) below. The
ﬁrst term in the action is the Wess-Zumino term where
the vector potential A creates a local magnetic ﬁeld as
∇n × A(n) = n. We assume that the magnetic order
in the ferromagnet is along the z-direction z. In order
to describe the ferromagnetic magnons l(τ, r), we write
1 − |l|2 + l, where |l| (cid:28) 1 and z· l = 0, leading to
n = z

FIG. 1: (color online) Schematic representation of the system and phase diagram: (a) A ferromagnetic (FM) layer deposited on
the surface of a topological insulator (TI), (b) the blue (light) disk indicates the region in momentum space bounded by a Fermi
surface with Fermi energy µF . Small arrows on the Fermi surface indicate an attractive interaction between electrons (red
balls) with momenta p1 and p2 and the angle between them is φp1,p2 = φp2 −φp1 , (c) Feynman diagrammatic representation of
Bethe-Salpeter equation and the interaction in direct and exchange channels, and in (d) we show the regions with the non-Fermi
liquid behavior and pairing instability at zero temperature. The horizontal axis stands for the frequency of transverse magnon
excitations with propagator DT (q). In the low frequency regime, the excitations are highly damped and Σ(ω) ∼ ω2/3, while in
T (q) and Σ(ω) ∼ ω1/2
the opposite regime up to an energy scale given by α2 the magnons are described by a bare propagator D0
dominates over the linear term. In both regimes the system is unstable to Amperian pairing. For some experimentally relevant
parameters g = 25 meV, µF = 0.1 eV and ρs (cid:39) 4 × 1012 cm−2 we found that the propagator of magnons falls into the damped
regime shown by a blue solid disk with strong instability to Amperian pairing.

A = 1/2(z × l). Neglecting orders higher than quadratic
terms, the action of magnons is written as [34]

The spinor ﬁelds ψ(τ, r) = (ψ↑, ψ↓)T describe the elec-
trons and σ is a vector of the Pauli matrices, represent-
ing spin. Other parameters are the Fermi energy µF
and the coupling g between electrons and magnetic mo-
ments. As we concentrate on the doped regime which is
relevant to the experiments [18, 20], we will ignore a uni-
form coupling gσz to the electrons that opens up a gap
of magnitude 2|g| at the Dirac node.
The helical nature of surface states allows us to present
the magnetic ﬂuctuations as dynamical gauge ﬁelds a =

It can be
split into longitudinal and transverse components as a =
aL + aT so that ∇ · aT = 0 and ∇ × aL = 0. The trans-
verse part is responsible for the emergent magnetic ﬁeld

are, respectively, the longitudinal and transverse compo-
nents. A local gauge transformation can eliminate the
longitudinal part of the gauge ﬁeld aL and transforms it
to the scalar potential ϕ, i.e. the temporal component.
The resulting action, describing electrons coupled to the
transverse gauge ﬁeld and the scalar potential, can be
written as follows.

Bosonic propagators.— We express the bare magnon
action in Eq. (2) in terms of transverse and tempo-
ral components. We obtain the temporal D0
ϕ(q) =
(cid:104)ϕ(−q), ϕ(q)(cid:105) and transverse D0
T (q) = (cid:104)aT (−q), aT (q)(cid:105)
propagators by, respectively, integrating out the trans-
verse and temporal ﬁelds as follows.

Here, q = (qn, q), where qn = 2nπ/β with β = 1/T ,
and q is 2d momentum. We use real frequencies Ω and
ω for analytically continued boson and fermion propaga-
tors, respectively, throughout. The magnon dispersion is
Ωq = κ|q|2. As we are interested in the low frequency
regime, where the transverse ﬁeld propagator is singu-
lar and the Amperian pairing sets in, the propagator

ignored. Therefore, the pairing instability sets in even in
the presence of a repulsive interaction due to the tempo-
ral components [9]. We are left with a theory of helical
electrons coupled to the massless and unscreened trans-
verse magnons. We write the latter in terms of bare
and dressed magnon propagators characterized by a di-
mensionless coupling constant α0 = g2ρF /ρsΩs = uη−1,
where ρF is the density of states at the Fermi surface
and Ωs = ηµF is to be understood as a maximum energy
transferred by magnons. Here, we introduced two di-
mensionless controlling parameters u = g2ρF /ρsµF and
η = mD/ms, where mD = µF /v2
F is to be interpreted as
the mass of Dirac electrons. For a typical set of param-
eters, which we discuss at the end of the paper, we have
α0 ∼ 1 and η (cid:28) 1. Hence, not only does the strength
of the Amperian interaction becomes singular especially
near the bosonic poles, but it also acquires moderate
strength even away from the bosonic poles. The pres-
ence of a small parameter η (cid:28) 1, which implies that
magnons are much slower than Dirac fermions, allows us
to neglect vertex corrections in the spirit of the Migdal
theorem [35, 36]. As a result, the dressed propagator of
transverse ﬁelds in the one-loop approximation is given
by

DT (q) =

where γ0 = g2ρF /ρs is the Landau damping.
In the
regime Ω (cid:29) α1µF , where α1 (cid:39) α0η2, the Landau damp-
ing term in the denominator of Eq. (6) can be ignored
reducing the dressed propagator DT (q) to the bare propa-
gator D0
T . On the other hand for Ω (cid:28) α1µF the Landau
damping term dominates and the propagator becomes
DT (q) = 1/ρs(κ|q|2 + γ0|qn|/v|q|) resembling the crit-
ical bosonic soft modes Ω ∼ qz with dynamical expo-
nent z = 3 appearing in diﬀerent contexts such as gauge
theory [37] of high-Tc superconductors [38] and critical
ferromagnetic systems [39]. We will show that in both
regimes the Fermi surface is unstable to Amperian pair-
ing. There are also other energy scales ω ∼ α2,3µF , where
α2 (cid:39) α2
0, which determine the non-Fermi
liquid behavior of electrons. We will discuss this below.
Transverse magnon-mediated interaction.— Upon in-
tegrating out the transverse magnons and projecting into
the conduction band, we obtain the eﬀective interaction
between electrons as

0η and α3 (cid:39) α2

Sint = −

where V is the volume of the system. Note that the
fermionic ﬁelds ψ’s have only a conduction band index, so
the interaction is between the eﬀective spinless fermions.
The key observation in Eq. (7) is the form of the inter-

3

action: that is Vp1,p2(q) = g2DT (q)Λp1,p2(q) with

Λp1,p2 (q) =

1
2

[cos(φp1 − φp2 ) − cos(φp1 + φp2 − 2φq)] ,(8)

where φ’s are the angles characterizing the corresponding
momentum. For small momentum transfers |q| (cid:28) |Q|,
where Q is the Fermi momentum, the angle φq varies
between zero and 2π for ﬁxed incoming momenta, mak-
ing the second term vanish in angular integration on φq.
Thus, Λ depends upon the angle between two incoming
momenta: Λ (cid:39) ˆp1 · ˆp2/2, where the hat stands for unit
vector. Importantly, Λ is positive for electrons moving
in almost the same direction, making the interaction at-
tractive. This resembles attraction between two wires
carrying co-moving currents and is the basis of the Am-
perian pairing theory as originally proposed by Lee et
al [12].

The attractive interaction between electrons can lead
to a Cooper-pairing instability that we explore below.
Unlike the conventional superconductors with singlet
pairing between electrons residing on opposite sides of
the Fermi surface, Amperian pairing occurs between elec-
trons residing on the same side of the Fermi surface. This
means that in Eq. (7) the incoming momenta are to be
taken as p1 = Q + p and p2 = Q − p with |p| (cid:28) |Q|.
This leads to Λ (cid:39) 1/2. In examining the pairing instabil-
ity, the interactions should be treated in both direct and
exchange channels [40] due to the spinless interaction.
This amounts to rewriting the interaction as

V (k, p) ¯ψQ+k ¯ψQ−kψQ−pψQ+p,

(9)

Sint = −

2Vβ

where V (k, p) = 1/4 [DT (k − p) − DT (k + p)] and k =
q + p as shown diagrammatically in Fig. 1(c). Given the
p-wave character of the pair wavefunction, both channels
have the same contributions to the eigenvalue problem
below.

Amperian pairing.— In order to examine the Ampe-
rian pairing instability of the Fermi surface, we examine
the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the eﬀective interaction
in Eq. (9) in the Cooper channel as shown diagrammat-
ically in Fig. 1(c).

This is the BCS self-consistency equation and Φ mea-
sures the pairing amplitude [41]. The instability towards

Amperian pairing is signaled as E ≥ 1. We shall argue
that the strength of singularity in the Cooper channel de-
pends on the renormalization of electrons by transverse
magnons via the electron self-energy Σ(p).

We now elaborate on the fermionic self-energies in the
regimes where Ω (cid:28) α1µF and Ω (cid:29) α1µF ; see also
In the former, the electron propagator is
Fig. 1(d).
given by G(p) = 1/[i(pn + L|pn/µF|2/3sgn(pn)) − ε(p)],
0 µF /2√3 and ε(p) is the electron dis-
where L = α2/3
persion on the surface of TI. Note that we considered
the frequency dependent self-energy correction near the
Fermi surface. The momentum part only renormalizes
the mass of the electrons.
It turns out that in this
regime the non-analytic term in the self-energy is much
larger than ω in the denominator of electron propgator.
Hence, the system becomes a non-Fermi liquid at low en-
ergies ω (cid:28) α3µF where α3 (cid:39) α2
0. Note that because
α3/α1 (cid:39) α0η−1 (cid:29) 1, the non-Fermi liquid behavior per-
sists even up to high frequency transfer of magnons.
On the other hand, for the latter regime where Ω (cid:29)
α1µF , the transverse magnons are not substantially Lan-
dau damped.
In this case the electron propagator is
dressed diﬀerently and is given as G(p) = 1/[i(pn +
N|pn/µF|1/2sgn(pn))− ε(p)], where N = α0η1/2µF /8π.
The self-energy could be parametrically larger than ω for
ω (cid:28) α2µF where α2 (cid:39) α2
0η. Note that α1 (cid:28) α2. Hence,
there exists a set of energy scales α1 (cid:28) α2 (cid:28) α3 deter-
mining the behavior of boson and electron propagators.
In treating the eigenvalue equation in Eq. (11), we fo-
cus on low energy limits of non-Fermi liquids set by α1,2
as shown in Fig. 1(d): (i) Landau damped and (ii) non-
Landau damped regimes. In both regimes the system is
unstable to Amperian pairing. We discuss each regime
separately.

(i) In the Landau damped regime the dressed propaga-
tors are analogous to spinons coupled to singular gauge
ﬁelds [12]. At zero temperature we replace the Matsub-
ara sum with integral over p0 and the momentum integral
over p is written as two one-dimensional integrals over
p⊥ and p(cid:107) where p⊥ (p(cid:107)) is the momentum component
perpendicular (parallel) to the Fermi momentum. Fol-
lowing the ansatz presented in Ref. [12] for wavefunction
Φ(p) = ˜Φ(p⊥)Θ(p2⊥/Q − |p(cid:107)|), where Θ is the Heaviside
function, the eigenvalue equation becomes

(cid:90)

E ˜Φ(p⊥) =

dtK(p⊥, t) ˜Φ(t + p⊥),

(12)

where the kernel K(p⊥, t) is given by

K(p⊥, t) =

|t|

√3π(t + p⊥)2

ln

(cid:20) t4/3 + 9(t + p⊥)4

t4/3 + (t + p⊥)4

(cid:21)

. (13)

To get an insight into E, the ﬁrst approximation would
be to consider a momentum independent wavefunction.
The rest of the integral
is logarithmically diverging,
which signals the possibility of pairing. The existence of

4

a realistic and nontrivial solution, however, requires that
the momentum dependent wavefunction is taken into ac-
count. Our numerical calculations and the results pre-
sented in Ref. [12] show that there exists such a solution
with odd pairing wavefunction, and the corresponding
eigenvalue becomes larger than unity for a large enough
system. Therefore, the system is unstable to Amperian
pairing.
Interestingly enough, the magnetic coupling g
doesn’t appear explicitly in Eq. (13). Thus, the Ampe-
rian pairing sets in even at small couplings, so long as
the bosonic propagator is in the highly damped regime
as shown in Fig. 1(d).
Indeed, the instability at zero
temperature here is due the fact that the kernel is highly
singular. This result indicates that Amperian pairing
occurs even at ﬁnite temperatures, which is the main
experimentally-relevant conclusion of this work.

(ii) In the non-Landau damped regime we found the
eigenvalue equation to be less singular. We obtained the
following expression for the kernel in Eq. (12).

K(p⊥, t) =

where A = µQ. The eigenvalue problem contains no
dimensional parameters. Upon changing variable t →
t − p⊥ and introducing dimensionless variables x = t/A
and y = p⊥/A, the corresponding eigenvalue equation
can be written as follows.

The natural ansatz to check is a constant wavefunction
˜Φ(x) = const. at y = 0 corresponding to pairing between
electrons right at the Fermi surface. This gives rise to
E = 1 in contrast to the logarithmic divergence found
in Landau damped case. This result shows that the sys-
tem is quantum critical on the verge of the Amperian
instability. We need, however, to look for a wavefunction
which is odd in momentum, i.e. a p-wave one. View-
ing the kernel as a matrix, we observed that there exists
such a solution. In fact, the momentum dependent so-
lution shows that the maximum eigenvalue of the kernel
becomes even larger than unity signaling the instability
of the system towards the pairing formation. Therefore,
even in the regime with small energy transfer of magnons,
as shown in Fig. 1(d), the non-Fermi liquid behavior and
pairing instability take place.

Concluding remarks.— In conclusion, we demon-
strated that there exists an Amperian pairing instability
at the surface of a 3D topological insulator when the
Dirac electrons are coupled to ferromagnetic ﬂuctua-
tions. The key idea is that the ferromagnetic ﬂuctuations
are minimally coupled to the electrons as gauge ﬁelds.
The transverse components of the gauge ﬁeld remains
gapless even in the presence of ﬁnite chemical doping;
they are not screened. Once integrated out, an eﬀective

interaction is mediated between electrons, which is
attractive between electrons moving almost in the same
direction. We showed that there exists strong pairing
instability and the system becomes unstable towards
superconductivity.
For estimations of energy scales
we used the following typical set of experimentally

relevant parameters g = 25 meV, ρs = 4 × 1012 cm−2,
µF = 0.1 eV and ms = 3.6 × 1010 eVs2/m2 leading
to values of α0 ∼ 1, u ≈ 1.5 × 10−3 and η ≈ 10−3 for
dimensionless parameters. For this set of parameters, we
found the characteristic energy transfer of magnon exci-
tations falls into the Landau damped regime, the case
(i), as marked by a blue disk in Fig. 1(d). Nevertheless,
we also explored the undamped regime, the case (ii), to
emphasize the possible extension of pairing instability
by tuning the parameters so that the latter regime
can be achieved. The main prediction of this work is
that topological insulator-ferromagnet heterosructures,
straightforwardly achievable with current experimental
capabilities, host a non-Fermi liquid state and an exotic
Amperian superconductor.
