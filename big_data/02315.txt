Abstract

Azimuthal angle correlations of two jets in the process pp → HHjj are studied. The loop
induced O(α4
sα2) gluon fusion (GF) sub-process and the O(α4) weak boson fusion (WBF) sub-
process are considered. The GF sub-process exhibits strong correlations in the azimuthal angles
φ1,2 of the two jets measured from the production plane of the Higgs boson pair and the diﬀerence
between these two angles φ1 − φ2, and a very small correlation in the sum of them φ1 + φ2. The
impact of using a ﬁnite top mass mt value on the correlations is found crucial. The transverse
momentum of the Higgs boson can be used to enhance or suppress the correlations. The impact
of a non-standard value for the triple Higgs self-coupling on the correlations is found much
smaller than that on other observables, such as the invariant mass of the two Higgs bosons.
The peak shifts of the azimuthal angle distributions reﬂect the magnitude of parity violation
in the gg → HH amplitude and the dependence of the distributions on parity violating phases
is analytically clariﬁed. The WBF sub-process also produces correlated distributions and it is
found that they are not induced by the quantum eﬀect of the intermediate weak bosons but
mainly by a kinematic eﬀect. This kinematic eﬀect is a characteristic feature of the WBF sub-
process and is not observed in the GF sub-process. It is found that the correlations are diﬀerent
in the GF and in the WBF sub-processes. As part of the process dependent information, they
will be helpful in the analyses of both the GF sub-process and the WBF sub-process at the
LHC.

Introduction

The discovery of a Higgs boson with a mass around 125 GeV in 2012 is the main discovery of Run
I of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [1, 2]. The study of its properties has started and until now
they are compatible with the Standard Model (SM) hypothesis [3–5]. To probe the mechanism of
electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) [6–9] directly one would want to measure the triple Higgs
self-coupling that is one of the key parameters of the scalar potential. This is one of the main
goals of the future high-luminosity LHC and the Future Circular Collider (FCC) in hadron–hadron
mode, a potential 100 TeV proton–proton collider following the LHC at CERN (for reviews of
the FCC physics potential, see refs. [10, 11]).
In this view the production of a pair of Higgs
bosons needs to be observed and has been extensively studied over the last years [12–32] (see also
Refs. [33–35] for studies at the FCC). The gluon fusion (GF) sub-process [36–39] and the weak
boson fusion (WBF) sub-process [36, 40–42] are the two main sub-processes, see e.g. Ref. [43] for a
review of SM studies. Both of the two sub-processes are sensitive to the triple Higgs self-coupling.
In the WBF sub-process, we have access to the coupling between the two Higgs bosons and the
two weak bosons, too.
In Refs. [23, 31] studies using the production of a pair of Higgs bosons
plus two hadronic jets has been conducted, using both the GF and the WBF sub-processes. The
main advantage of the latter sub-process is the fact that the theoretical uncertainties are under
control [19, 28], but the phenomenological studies suﬀer from the diﬃculty to separate the GF
contributions from that of the WBF.

Azimuthal angle correlations of two jets produced together with heavy particles have been
actively studied as a provider of important information about the heavy particles [44–50]. The
correlations are induced by only a certain type of sub-processes, called vector boson fusion (VBF)
sub-processes, in which a heavy object is produced by a fusion of two vector bosons emitted from
incoming two coloured particles. The correlations arise from the quantum eﬀect of the two fusing
intermediate vector bosons [42, 47] 1. A set of cuts on the rapidity y1,2 of the two jets, y2 < 0 < y1
(cid:38) 3 and an upper cut on the transverse momentum pT of the two jets are therefore
and y1 − y2
1The azimuthal angle correlations of two outgoing electrons in e+e− collisions, induced by the quantum eﬀect of

two intermediate virtual photons, have been discussed a long time ago, see e.g. [51].

crucial for the two jets to show strong correlations if any, since they enhance contributions from
VBF sub-processes [47]. These rapidity cuts are often called VBF cuts.

The azimuthal angle correlations of the two jets both in the GF sub-process and in the WBF
sub-process of the single Higgs boson plus two jets production process pp → Hjj [42, 44–47, 52]
are nowadays a common knowledge, have been studied in detail [53–64] and applied in many
phenomenological studies. However, the azimuthal angle correlations of the two jets in the Higgs
boson pair plus two jets production process pp → HHjj have not been studied thoroughly. To
sα2)
our knowledge, the correlations in the GF sub-process, which is an one-loop induced O(α4
process at leading order (LO), have not been studied in the literature. One of the reasons may
be that event generations are still challenging even with an advanced calculation technique. For
the GF sub-process in the process pp → Hjj, the approach of using the eﬀective interactions
between the Higgs boson and gluons is known to work quite well as long as the pT of the jets
are small enough [65, 66]. The azimuthal angle correlation after the VBF cuts can also be
described correctly [66]. Therefore event generations can be easily performed with a tree-level
event generator which implements the eﬀective interactions. In contrast, for the GF sub-process in
the process pp → HHjj, the eﬀective interaction approach is known not to work well in describing
the distributions of several observables [23, 31]. It is naively expected that this observation is the
same for the azimuthal angle correlations. The process pp → HHjj at LO with the exact one loop
amplitude has been calculated for the ﬁrst time in ref. [23] and subsequently phenomenology is
studied in ref. [31]. The fully automated event generation for one-loop induced processes is now
available in MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [67, 68]. This achievement will activate further phenomenological
studies of the process pp → HHjj including studies which use the azimuthal angle correlations.
The azimuthal angle correlations of the two jets in the WBF sub-process, which is an O(α4)
process at LO, have been studied in [42]. There, only the azimuthal angle diﬀerence of the two
jets is studied as an azimuthal angle observable.

In this paper, we study the azimuthal angle correlations of the two jets in the process pp →
HHjj. Instead of considering all of the sub-processes contributing to the process pp → HHjj, we
consider only the VBF sub-processes:

bosons emitted from incoming two coloured particles. More precisely, we calculate the amplitudes
contributed from only t-channel Feynman diagrams shown in Figure 1 2. We call them VBF
amplitudes and VBF diagrams, respectively, in this paper. The circles denote all the Feynman
diagrams contributing to the process V ∗V ∗
→ HH at LO. When the two virtual vector bosons are
weak bosons (WBF sub-process), there are four tree-level Feynman diagrams, and when the two
virtual vector bosons are gluons (GF sub-process), there are eight one-loop Feynman diagrams.
We calculate these LO diagrams explicitly.

Our calculation is not exact but an approximated one. In ref. [47] it has been demonstrated
that the inclusive cross section and the azimuthal angle correlations contributed only from the
VBF diagrams are in good agreement with those contributed from all the diagrams, when the two
jets are required to satisfy the VBF cuts and an upper pT cut, in the processes pp → Φjj, where
Φ = H, A, G denotes the Higgs boson, a parity-odd Higgs boson and a spin-2 massive graviton,
respectively. This observation indicates that a result based only on VBF diagrams is a good
approximation to the exact LO result as long as the two jets satisfy the VBF cuts and an upper
pT cut appropriately. Therefore our approach of calculating only the VBF amplitude is the simple
and appropriate approach, when we study the azimuthal angle correlations (Let us remind that the
correlations are induced only by the VBF sub-processes.). The same approach has been applied to

the processes pp → Q ¯Qjj, where Q denotes the top quark or the bottom quark, in ref. [50] and the

validity of this approach is again observed. In order to check the validity of this approach in the
GF sub-process by ourselves, we have numerically compared our cross section formula in which the
loop-running top quark mass is set quite large (large mt limit) and the exact LO result generated
by MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [67] which implements the eﬀective interactions between gluons and the
Higgs bosons (inﬁnite mt limit). We have found a good agreement between the two results both
in the inclusive cross section and in the distributions of several observables including azimuthal
angle observables. From these observations, we are conﬁdent that our calculation of the azimuthal
angle correlations is a good approximation to the exact LO result.

In order to measure the azimuthal angle correlations, we study four observables: φ1, φ2,
∆φ = φ1 − φ2 and φ+ = φ1 + φ2, where φ1,2 are azimuthal angles of the two jets measured
from the production plane of the Higgs boson pair (∆φ is irrelevant to the production plane as
is clear from its deﬁnition). ∆φ is the observable which is sensitive to the property of the Higgs
boson in the process pp → Hjj [44–47, 49] and thus has been the subject of many studies. The
processes pp → Gjj [47] and pp → Q ¯Qjj [50] exhibit strong correlations in φ+. To our knowledge,
correlations in φ1,2 have not been addressed in any hadronic process in the literature. Our explicit
ﬁndings can be summarised as follows. The GF sub-process has strong correlations in ∆φ and φ1,2,
and the pT of the Higgs boson can be an useful measure to enhance or suppress these correlations.
Using the ﬁnite mt value is important to produce the correlations correctly. Violation of the
parity invariance of the gg → HH amplitude appears as the peak shifts of the correlations. The
impact of a non-standard value for the triple Higgs self-coupling on the correlations is smaller than
that on other observables, such as the invariant mass of the two Higgs bosons, of the inclusive
process pp → HH. The correlation in φ+ is negligibly small in most every case. The WBF
sub-process produces correlated distributions in all of the azimuthal angle observables and they
are not induced by the quantum eﬀect of the intermediate weak bosons but mainly by a kinematic
eﬀect. This kinematic eﬀect is a characteristic feature of the WBF sub-process and is not observed

in the GF sub-process. The impact of a non-standard value for the triple Higgs self-coupling on
the correlations is not signiﬁcant in the WBF sub-process, too. The correlations in the GF and
WBF sub-processes are found to be diﬀerent.

The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we perform a calculation of the VBF amplitudes.
Since it can be shown that the azimuthal angle correlations arise from the interference of amplitudes
with various helicities of the two intermediate vector bosons [42,47], we employ a helicity amplitude
technique. Our calculation is performed based on the method presented in ref. [47]. A full analytic
set of helicity amplitudes is presented. Since the material in Section 2 is rather technical, the reader
who is interested in only the results may skip this section. In Section 3, a detailed study of the
azimuthal angle correlations is presented. First, we discuss the GF sub-process in Section 3.1. The
squared VBF amplitude for the four sub-processes eq. (1.1) is given in a compact form. This analytic
formula is found to be quite useful in making expectations of the correlations. The correlations in
diﬀerent kinematic regions of the two Higgs bosons and those in non-standard values for the Higgs
triple self-coupling are studied. The impact of parity violation in the gg → HH amplitude on the
correlations is also studied. Next, we discuss the WBF sub-process in Section 3.2. The squared
VBF amplitude is given in a simple form by keeping only the dominant terms. The correlations in
non-standard values for the Higgs triple self-coupling are studied. In Section 4 we summarise our
ﬁndings and give some comments.

2 Helicity amplitudes for the process pp → V ∗V ∗jj → HHjj

In this section we present a full analytic set of helicity amplitudes contributed from the vector
boson fusion (VBF) diagrams. Our calculation is based on the method presented in ref. [47]. We
present a more complete discussion on the treatment of the intermediate oﬀ-shell gluons in the VBF
diagrams. In addition, we discuss the importance of an appropriate choice of gauge-ﬁxing vectors
for the polarisation vectors of the external gluons. We believe that the above two remarks provide
suﬃcient justiﬁcation for repeating some of the calculations of ref. [47].

For the weak boson fusion (WBF) sub-process, we have (V1, V2) = (W +, W −), (W −, W +) and
(Z, Z), and only the VBF diagram shown in Figure 1 (left) contributes to the VBF amplitude. The
VBF amplitude is gauge invariant on its own. This is apparent from the fact that only the VBF
diagram exists in some of the WBF sub-processes, for instance there are no other diagrams describ-
ing the sub-process ud → udHH. We choose the unitary gauge for the weak boson propagator,

Eq. (2.7a) represents a helicity amplitude for the splitting process ai → ai+2Vi, where Vi is oﬀ-shell.
This will be derived in Section 2.2. Eq. (2.7b) represents a helicity amplitude for the process
V1V2 → HH, where V1 and V2 are oﬀ-shell. This will be presented in Section 2.3.

The gluon fusion (GF) sub-process (V1, V2) = (g, g) is more complicated than the WBF sub-
process. The VBF amplitude for the qq initiated sub-process (a1, a2) = (q, q) is gauge invariant on
its own, the reason being the same as for the WBF amplitude. If we choose the Feynman-’t Hooft
gauge for a gluon propagator, the projector part of the propagator is:

(2.10)

Therefore, for the qq initiated sub-process, we can arrive at the same expression as in eq. (2.6). In
ref. [47], the above procedure and thus the expression eq. (2.6) is used not only for the qq initiated
sub-process but also for the qg and gg initiated sub-processes (a1, a2) = (q, g), (g, g) 4. We point
out that this approach does not necessarily calculate the oﬀ-shell eﬀects of the intermediate gluons
correctly for the qg and gg initiated sub-processes and only introduces unnecessary complications
in the amplitude calculation. Since the oﬀ-shell gluon amplitude (MHH
is not enhanced in
the on-shell limit of the gluons, we can always expand the oﬀ-shell gluon amplitude around the
on-shell limit. To make our discussion simpler, let us consider an amplitude which involves only
one oﬀ-shell gluon. The oﬀ-shell gluon amplitude can be expanded as

gg )λ1λ2

,

where Q is the virtuality of the gluon and the ﬁrst term in the right hand side (RHS) of the
ﬁrst equation is the on-shell amplitude, which is gauge invariant. As we will see in Section 2.2,
the amplitude for the splitting process in eq. (2.7a), where an oﬀ-shell gluon with virtuality Q is
emitted, has an overall factor of Q. By considering this factor and Q−2 in the propagator factor of
the oﬀ-shell gluon, we ﬁnd the following term in a VBF amplitude:

4The λ = s component µ(q, λ = s) = qµ/(cid:112)−q2 vanishes when it couples to a gluon current, too.

While the ﬁrst term in the RHS of the above equation is gauge invariant, the rest terms are generally
dependent on a gauge-ﬁxing choice for the oﬀ-shell gluon. As we have mentioned above, for the
qq initiated sub-process, the VBF amplitude is gauge invariant on its own and hence not only the
ﬁrst term in the RHS of eq. (2.11) but also the other terms as a whole are gauge invariant. This is
not the case for the qg and gg initiated sub-processes. For the qg and gg initiated sub-processes,
the second and higher terms in the RHS of eq. (2.11), which are not enhanced in the on-shell limit,
become gauge invariant only after contributions from other diagrams are also included. Therefore,
in our method where only the VBF diagrams are calculated, we can calculate the oﬀ-shell eﬀect of
the intermediate gluons correctly only for the qq initiated sub-process. For the qg and gg initiated
sub-processes, therefore, we take the following approach: Completely ignore the oﬀ-shell eﬀect of
the intermediate gluons and look at only a kinematic region where the virtualities of the gluons are
small (Q → 0). This is possible because the oﬀ-shell eﬀect in the amplitude will not be essential as
long as we look at the small virtuality region, as is clear from eq. (2.11). The unitarity condition
gives the following equation for a gluon propagator in its on-shell limit q2 → 0:

(cid:0)q(cid:1)(cid:88)
(cid:0)q(cid:1) = Dg
(cid:0)q(cid:1) =(cid:0)q2(cid:1)−1.

By using this, we can express the VBF amplitude for the GF sub-process as a product of three
helicity amplitudes in the same way that we do for the WBF sub-process and the qq initiated GF
sub-process in eq. (2.6). The diﬀerences from the qq initiated GF sub-process are (1) the λ = 0
component µ(q, λ = 0) in eq. (2.6) is neglected, (2) the oﬀ-shell gluon amplitude (MHH

approximations are nothing less than the two fundamental ingredients of the equivalent photon
approximation (EPA) [70, 71]. As a rule of using the EPA, we should clarify the kinematic region
where the approximated VBF amplitude is a good approximation to the exact VBF amplitude. For
the process pp → HHjj, it should be −q2
HH . We use the EPA
not only for the qg and gg initiated sub-processes but also for the qq initiated sub-process, so that
we can consistently use the on-shell gluon amplitude (MHH
. It should be noted that, while
we use the on-shell gluon amplitude for the process gg → HH, the amplitude for an oﬀ-shell gluon
emission in eq. (2.7a) is still calculated without ignoring the oﬀ-shell eﬀect of the gluon (q2
1,2 (cid:54)= 0),
as in other applications of the EPA.

2.2 Helicity amplitudes for the splitting processes

We derive the helicity amplitude (2.7a) for the splitting processes. We use the chiral representation
for Dirac matrices. Since we neglect the mass of the external quarks, the helicity of the quark
is equal to its chirality and the helicity of the antiquark is opposite to its chirality. As a result,
the helicity of ai is always equal to that of ai+2 (σi = σi+2) for the quark and antiquark splitting
processes. Otherwise, the amplitude vanishes. By introducing one common current ˆJ µ
i , we can
express the quark and antiquark currents J µ

Generally speaking, helicities are frame dependent and so are helicity amplitudes. When we
in eq. (2.6), we must choose one frame at ﬁrst and
calculate the VBF helicity amplitude M
then deﬁne the four-momenta and the helicities of all the external particles in this particular
frame. For our calculation we choose the centre-of-mass (c.m.)
frame of the two intermediate
vector bosons moving along the z-axis, which is shown in the middle of Figure 3. We call it the

VBF frame. Note that the production plane of the two Higgs bosons coincides with the plane of
the x-z axes. All of the three helicity amplitudes in the VBF helicity amplitude must be evaluated
in the VBF frame. However, by using a property of helicities, we can justify a calculation of
for the splitting processes in a diﬀerent frame. Because the
the helicity amplitude (J
helicity of a massless quark is frame independent and furthermore the helicity of a massive vector
boson is invariant under Lorentz boosts along its momentum direction as long as the boosts do
not change the sign of its three-momentum 5, the helicity amplitude (J
for the quark
splitting processes is invariant under Lorentz boosts along the z-axis from the VBF frame, as
long as the boosts do not change the sign of the three-momentum of Vi. By this property, it is
justiﬁed to calculate the helicity amplitude (J
for the quark splitting process in the q1
Breit frame, to which k1,3 and q1 in the VBF frame can move by a single Lorentz boost along
the negative direction of the z-axis. Similarly, it is justiﬁed to calculate the helicity amplitude
(J
for the quark splitting process in the q2 Breit frame, to which k2,4 and q2 in the
VBF frame can move by a single Lorentz boost along the positive direction of the z-axis. The q1
and q2 Breit frames are illustrated in the left and right of Figure 3, respectively. A calculation
of the helicity amplitude (J
for the gluon splitting process in the qi Breit frame is
also justiﬁed by appropriately choosing gauge-ﬁxing vectors for the polarisation vectors of the
external gluons. Although the helicity of a gluon is frame independent, the polarisation vectors
of the gluon are dependent on their gauge-ﬁxing vectors and hence the helicity amplitude for the
gluon splitting process is in general frame dependent. However, if we choose the gauge ﬁxing
vectors in a way that their directions are invariant under Lorentz boosts along the z-axis, the
helicity amplitude for the gluon splitting process also becomes invariant under the same boosts,
again as long as the boosts do not change the sign of the three-momentum of the intermediate
oﬀ-shell gluon. This can be simply achieved by choosing all the gauge-ﬁxing vectors along the z-axis.

process. Not only we neglect the λ1,2 = 0 components of the gluons, but we also set Q1 = Q2 = 0
in the four-momenta in eq. (2.25). Our deﬁnitions of the polarisation vectors µ(qi, λi = ±) in
eqs. (2.26) and (2.27) actually correspond to an axial gauge nµ = (1, 0, 0,−1) for an on-shell gluon

independently aﬀect the ∆λ = λ1− λ2 = 0 helicity states and ∆λ = ±2 helicity states, respectively.
We believe that this simpliﬁed introduction of parity violating phases is enough for studying the
impact of parity violation on the azimuthal angle correlations.

3 Azimuthal angle correlations

In this section we present a detailed study of the azimuthal angle correlations of the two jets by
using the helicity amplitudes presented in Section 2.

3.1 The gluon fusion process

The azimuthal angle correlations of the two jets can be analytically apparent, once we obtain the
squared VBF amplitude. There are four gluon fusion (GF) sub-processes (V1, V2) = (g, g), namely
the qq initiated sub-process (a1, a2) = (q, q), the qg initiated sub-processes (a1, a2) = (q, g), (g, q)
and the gg initiated sub-process (a1, a2) = (g, g). The squared VBF amplitude for the four GF

(2.18), and summarised in Table 2. The azimuthal angles φ1,2 are also deﬁned in the Breit
frames.
b1,2 are the colour indices of the intermediate gluons and an average for b1,2 is per-
formed, see eq. (2.29). The colour factors Ca1a2
and the functions Fi[a1a2] for antiquarks are
the same as those for quarks, since the QCD interaction does not distinguish quarks and antiquarks.

The ﬁrst term in the right hand side (RHS) of eq. (3.1) contributes to the inclusive cross section
after a phase space integration, while the other terms give the azimuthal angle distributions of the
two jets. The azimuthal angles φ1,2 of the two jets are deﬁned in the q1,2 Breit frames, respectively,
and they remain the same in the VBF frame. In the limit that each of the two jets in the proton-
proton (pp) frame is collinear to the incoming parton that emits it (collinear limit), the emitted two
intermediate vector bosons also move on the z-axis. After rotating the two jets and the two Higgs
bosons around the z-axis in such a way that the two Higgs bosons have zero azimuthal angle (Let
us remind that the two Higgs bosons have zero azimuthal angle in the VBF frame, see eq. (2.25))
and after a single boost along the z-axis, all of these particles can be studied in the VBF frame.
Therefore, in the collinear limit, the azimuthal angles of the two jets after the single rotation around
the z-axis are identical to φ1 and φ2. We apply the VBF cuts and an upper transverse momentum
pT cut on the jets in the pp frame and these cuts reproduce the collinear limit to some extent.
Hence the azimuthal angles of the two jets in the pp frame after the rotation around the z-axis
should not be very diﬀerent from φ1,2 deﬁned in the q1,2 Breit frames. We perform the rotation of
the two jets and the two Higgs bosons around the z-axis in the following way:

1. Go to the centre-of-mass (c.m.) frame of the two Higgs bosons and then rotate the two Higgs
bosons around the z-axis by ˜φ in a way that the two Higgs bosons have zero azimuthal angle.

2. Rotate the two jets in the pp frame around the z-axis by ˜φ.

3. Measure the azimuthal angles of the two jets.

In the collinear limit, it is clear that the azimuthal angles of the two jets measured after this
rotation coincide with φ1,2. Note that this rotation is necessary for the azimuthal angles and the
sum of them to show meaningful distributions, because the process pp → HHjj in the pp frame is
completely symmetric around the z-axis. This rotation is, however, not needed for the diﬀerence
of the two azimuthal angles. Before we show numerical results, we point out characteristic features
of the GF sub-process in the standard model (SM) already expected from the analytic formula
eq. (3.1):

• The azimuthal angles of the two jets show the same distribution due to the parity invariance
of the amplitude ˆMλ1λ2
• All of the azimuthal angle observables show cosine distributions, again due to the parity

, see eq. (2.32).

invariance of the amplitude.

Violation of the parity invariance of the amplitude should appear as a deviation from the above
expectations. This case will be studied at the end of this subsection.

We show numerical results for the 14 TeV LHC. We do not study decays of the two Higgs
bosons and assume that they can be reconstructed. An outgoing quark, antiquark or gluon is
identiﬁed as a jet. The following set of parameters are chosen: mH = 125.5 GeV, mt = 173.5
GeV and αs(mZ) = 0.13. We use the CTEQ6L1 [74] set for the parton distribution functions

For the
scales in the PDFs, we choose a ﬁxed value of 25 GeV, which corresponds to the lower cutoﬀ on
the transverse momentum pT of the jets (see below). The scales in the strong couplings are chosen
as αs(√ˆs)2αs(150GeV)2, where √ˆs is the invariant mass of the two Higgs bosons. Using the two

diﬀerent scales in the strong couplings can be considered as a better choice, since we look at only
a kinematic region where the virtualities of the gluons are small (Q1,2 → 0) and this separates the
two splitting processes from the process gg → HH in time-scale. The scales in the strong couplings
of the splitting processes correspond to the upper cutoﬀ on the pT of the jets. The following cuts
are applied on the rapidity y and pT of the two jets in the pp frame:

−5 < y2 < 0 < y1 < 5,

y1 − y2 > 5,

25 GeV < pT < 150 GeV.

(3.2)

The above rapidity cuts are the VBF cuts. As we have already mentioned in Section 1, the VBF
cuts and the upper pT cut enhance the contributions from the VBF sub-processes. This can be
understood as follows. The virtuality Q1 of the intermediate vector boson V1 is

where the momentum assignment given in eq. (2.1) is used and θ13 is the angle between (cid:126)k1 and (cid:126)k3.
The VBF cuts make (cid:126)k3 collinear to (cid:126)k1 (θ13 → 0), then Q1 is decreased and the VBF amplitude
is enhanced. The upper pT cut additionally enhances the VBF amplitude.

so the upper pT cut reasonably implies the upper cut on Q1. Only the VBF cuts may be enough
to enhance contributions from the VBF sub-processes. However, we need to impose the upper pT
cut, too, because we perform the two approximations in calculating the VBF amplitude for the GF
sub-process and these approximations are justiﬁed only when Q2
2 < ˆs. Throughout our
analyses, the four-momentum of the jet which has a positive rapidity y1 in the pp frame is used
for calculating its azimuthal angle labelled as φ1 and that of the other jet which has a negative
rapidity y2 in the pp frame is used for calculating its azimuthal angle labelled as φ2. Azimuthal
angles labelled as φ1,2 in our numerical results shown below are not those deﬁned in the q1,2
Breit frames anymore. The phase space integration and event generations are performed with the
programs BASES and SPRING [75]. The scalar loop functions are calculated with the program FF [76].

approximation to the exact cross section formula. The discrepancy between the result (1) and
the result (2) in the φ1,2 plots particularly shows the importance of using a ﬁnite mt value in
the azimuthal angle distributions. The reason why we do not ﬁnd correlated distributions in φ1,2
in the large mt results can be understood from the squared VBF amplitude in eq. (3.1). The
second and third terms in the RHS shows that the correlations in φ1,2 arise from the interference

(right) deﬁned in eq. (3.6) with the pT

of the amplitudes ˆMλ1λ2
for ∆λ = 0 and ∆λ = ±2 states, where ∆λ = λ1 − λ2. In the large
mt limit, the amplitude for ∆λ = ±2 states vanishes and hence the correlations also vanish. The
GF sub-process exhibits the largest correlation in ∆φ and an almost zero correlation in φ+. The
squared VBF amplitude in eq. (3.1) tells us that the correlation in ∆φ arises from the interference
of the amplitudes ˆMλ1λ2
for ∆λ = 0 states (the fourth term in the RHS) and the correlation
in φ+ arises from the interference of the amplitudes for ∆λ = ±2 states (the ﬁfth term in the
RHS). The reason of the large correlation in ∆φ and the small correlation in φ+ is because the
amplitudes for ∆λ = 0 states are much larger than those for ∆λ = ±2 states in a large part of
the phase space (this will be conﬁrmed explicitly below soon). We brieﬂy mention diﬀerences
between the processes pp → HHjj and pp → Hjj in the correlations. The process gg → H has
non-zero amplitudes ˆMλ1λ2
only for ∆λ = 0 states. Therefore, the process pp → Hjj exhibits a
large correlation in ∆φ [44–47] but no correlations in φ1,2 and φ+.

In Figure 5 we show the diﬀerential cross section as a function of φ1,2 (left), ∆φ = φ1 − φ2
(middle) and φ+ = φ1 + φ2 (right), contributed by all of the sub-processes (black curve, labelled
as (1) pp), by the qg and gq initiated sub-processes (blue curve, labelled as (2) qg + gq), by the gg
initiated sub-process (red curve, labelled as (3) gg) and by the qq initiated sub-process (green curve,
labelled as (4) qq). All of the numerical results hereafter in this subsection are produced by using
our analytic cross section formula. As we have already discussed before showing the numerical
results and have actually conﬁrmed in Figure 4, φ1 and φ2 show the same distribution due to the
parity invariance of the amplitude in the SM. Therefore, we show only the φ1 distribution and
label it φ1,2 instead of showing the both distributions, until we study parity violation. In Table 3,
we present the inclusive cross sections of qqHH, ggHH, qgHH ﬁnal states and the sum of these
ﬁnal states in pp collisions. The calculation methods are the same as those used in Figure 4. A
good agreement (within 5%) between the second row and the third row for each cross section again
conﬁrms the validity of our analytic cross section formula. A large discrepancy between the ﬁrst
row and the second (or third) row for each cross section can be considered as another important
result of using the ﬁnite mt value.

These are simply the coeﬃcients of the azimuthal angle dependent terms divided by the coeﬃcient
of the azimuthal angle independent term in eq. (3.1). Although the functions Fi[a1a2] are omitted,
these quantities are useful in that an azimuthal angle observable should show a strong correlation
in a kinematic region where the corresponding quantity CRi is enhanced. We ﬁnd that all of the
quantities CRi are well correlated with the pT of the Higgs boson in the c.m.

in the most part of the phase space
The large value of CR2∆φ and the small value of CR2φ+
explain the large correlation in ∆φ and the small correlation in φ+ observed in Figure 4. The
plots indicate that the correlation in ∆φ is enhanced as the pT of the Higgs boson is decreased,
while the correlations in φ1,2 and φ+ are enhanced as the pT of the Higgs boson is increased.
This is conﬁrmed in Figure 7. In Figure 7, we show the normalised diﬀerential cross section as a
function of φ1,2 (left), ∆φ = φ1 − φ2 (middle) and φ+ = φ1 + φ2 (right) with diﬀerent values for
the lower cutoﬀ on the pT of the Higgs boson in the c.m. frame of the two Higgs bosons, blue solid
curve: pT > 0 GeV (no cut), black dashed curve: pT > 150 GeV, and red solid curve: pT > 250 GeV.

Next, we study how the azimuthal angle correlations depend on the triple Higgs self-coupling.
Eqs. (2.31) and (2.32) tell us that λh, which is the factor re-scaling the triple Higgs self-coupling,
aﬀects only the amplitude ˆMλ1λ2
for ∆λ = 0 states. However, as is clear from the quantities

(middle) and φ+ (right), with three diﬀerent values for the triple Higgs self-coupling re-scaling factor λh.
The correspondence between the curves and the values for λh is shown inside the left panel

in eq. (3.6), λh aﬀects all of the correlations. For an extreme example, if we could make the
amplitude for ∆λ = 0 states to be identically zero (this is actually not possible because the
amplitude depend not only on λh but also on the kinematic of the process gg → HH), we would
observe a large correlation only in φ+. In Figure 8, we study the correlations with three diﬀerent
values for λh, the blue solid curve: λh = 0, the black dashed curve: λh = 1 (the SM prediction),
and the red solid curve: λh = 2. The impact of a non-standard value for λh (λh (cid:54)= 1) in the
distributions is visible but not large. Actually this is much smaller than that in other observables,
such as the pT of the Higgs boson [18, 19] or the invariant mass of the two Higgs bosons [19, 22],
of the inclusive process pp → HH. The azimuthal angle correlations may not be useful to probe λh.
Finally, we study the impact of parity symmetry violation on the azimuthal angle correlations.
Let us remind that we have introduced two phases ξ1,2 in eq. (2.34) and these phases parametrise
the magnitude of parity violation in the process gg → HH. If they are non-zero, the gg → HH
amplitude ˆMλ1λ2
ˆM++ (cid:54)= ˆM−− if ξ1 (cid:54)= 0, ˆM+− (cid:54)= ˆM−+ if
ξ2 (cid:54)= 0. The squared VBF amplitude eq. (3.1) tells us that violation of the parity invariance of the
amplitude appears as the following deviations from the standard model predictions: (1) the φ1 and
φ2 distributions are not necessarily equal to each other, (2) the azimuthal angle observables do not
necessarily show cosine distributions. In order to make these expectations more explicit, we write

is not parity invariant anymore:

the amplitude ˆMλ1λ2

with the phases ξ1,2 in the following way:

ˆMλ,λ = A e+iλξ1,
ˆMλ,−λ = B e+iλξ2.

These are simply obtained by putting eq. (2.34) into the amplitude in eq. (2.31) and substituting
the terms including the form factors with A and B. By inserting the above amplitudes into the

These results show that parity violation appears as peak shifts of the azimuthal angle distributions.
The results also tell us an important fact that the peak shifts of the distributions reﬂect only the
magnitude of parity violation (Recall that ξ1,2 parametrise the magnitude of parity violation in our
study). It is an easy exercise to conﬁrm that this is true no matter how parity violating phases are
introduced. From the above analytic results, it is also apparent how each observable depends on
the phases ξ1,2. ∆φ is sensitive to ξ1 and φ+ is sensitive to ξ2. φ1 and φ2 are sensitive to both of
ξ1 and ξ2. Although we are far less likely to be able to measure ξ2 in the φ+ distribution because
of the very small correlation in φ+, we may use φ1 and φ2 to probe ξ2 instead.

We note in passing the impact of parity violation in the process pp → Hjj, which can be
considered as a simpler case. Since the process gg → H has non-zero amplitudes ˆMλ1λ2
only
for ∆λ = λ1 − λ2 = 0 states, the process pp → Hjj has only eq. (3.9c) in its cross section
formula. Therefore, parity violation in the process gg → H appears as a peak shift only in the ∆φ
distribution [45, 46].

While the phase dependence on the correlations is apparent from eq. (3.9), we present numerical
results, too. In Figure 9 we show the normalised diﬀerential cross section as a function of φ1 (left
column), φ2 (middle column) and ∆φ = φ1 − φ2 (right column) with diﬀerent values for ξ1,2. The
correspondence between the curves and values for ξ1,2 is shown inside each panel. In all of the
panels, the SM prediction is shown by the black dashed curve. A cutoﬀ, pT > 200 GeV, is imposed
on the pT of the Higgs boson in the c.m.
frame of the two Higgs bosons, when we produce the
φ1 and φ2 plots, in order to enhance the correlations in φ1,2, see Figure 7. The distributions of
φ+ = φ1 + φ2 are not shown anymore, since we have found that the correlation in φ+ is very small
in most every case, see Figures 7 and 8.

3.2 The weak boson fusion process
The weak boson fusion (WBF) sub-process (V1, V2) = (W +, W −), (W −, W +) and (Z, Z) consists
of only the qq initiated sub-process (a1, a2) = (q, q). However, the squared VBF amplitude
for the WBF sub-process takes a more complicated form than that for the GF sub-process in
eq. (3.1) because of the following two reasons:
(1) the helicity λ1,2 = 0 components of the
intermediate weak bosons additionally induce eight azimuthal angle dependent terms, such as
cos (φ1 − φ2), (2) we cannot simply take averages for the initial helicities and take summations
for the ﬁnal helicities, since the electroweak interactions distinguish diﬀerent helicity states. The
squared VBF amplitude for four sets of the helicities of the external quarks must be prepared:

(σ1, σ3, σ2, σ4) = (+, +, +, +), (+, +,−,−), (−,−, +, +), (−,−,−,−).

)λ1λ2

The amplitude (MHH

for helicity λ1,2 = 0 weak bosons gives a dominant contribution
in the WBF sub-process and the amplitudes for other helicities are much smaller than the above
amplitude. Thus we can expect that all of the azimuthal angle correlations are small, because
the correlations arise from the interference of the amplitudes for various helicities, see eq. (3.1).
If we keep only terms which contain at least one (MHH
)00, the squared VBF amplitude for
(σ1, σ3, σ2, σ4) = (+, +, +, +) has the following form:

The couplings should be also changed accordingly. The coeﬃcients of cos φ1,2 terms actually
contain one ˆM00, too. However, the cos φ1,2 terms cannot give correlated distributions in the
process pp → HHjj, because we cannot distinguish the two Higgs bosons. More practically,
an azimuthal angle dependent term which changes its overall sign under the transformations
φ1 → φ1 + π and φ2 → φ2 + π gives only a ﬂat distribution after the phase space integration.
The ﬁrst term in the right hand side (RHS) of eq. (3.10) contributes to the inclusive cross section
after the phase space integration and the other terms give the correlations in ∆φ = φ1 − φ2
and φ+ = φ1 − φ2. An interesting diﬀerence from the GF sub-process is that the sine terms do
not vanish even when the amplitude is parity invariant ( ˆM++ = ˆM−− and ˆM+− = ˆM−+), if
the amplitude contains an imaginary part. This is because the interaction between the external
quarks and the intermediate weak boson already violates the parity symmetry. In our tree-level
calculation, the amplitude is purely real and we will observe only cosine distributions.

We show numerical results for the 14 TeV LHC. The setup and phase space cuts are the same
as in the GF study in Section 3.1. Therefore the numerical results in this Section can be directly

The only diﬀerence is the scale choice in the PDFs. The pT
of the jet with a positive rapidity is used for the scale in the PDF of the incoming parton which
moves along the positive direction of the z-axis, and the pT of the jet with a negative rapidity is
used for the scale in the PDF of the other incoming parton. In Figure 10, we show the normalised
diﬀerential cross section as a function of φ1 (upper left), φ2 (upper right), ∆φ = φ1 − φ2 (lower
left) and φ+ = φ1 + φ2 (lower right). The blue solid curve, labelled as (1) VBF, represents the
result according to our analytic cross section formula, to which only the VBF diagrams contribute.
The black dashed curve, labelled as (2) MG, represents the result according to the exact LO cross
section, to which not only the VBF diagrams but also the s-channel and u-channel diagrams
contribute, generated by MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [67] version 5.2.2.1. The red solid curve, labelled as
(3) VBF w/o QE, represents the result according to our analytic cross section formula from which
the azimuthal angle dependent terms are removed on purpose, that is, the quantum eﬀects of the
intermediate weak bosons expressed as the interference of the amplitudes for diﬀerent helicities
are killed. Therefore, the diﬀerences between the result (1) and the result (3) in the distributions
visualise the contribution from the azimuthal angle dependent terms. The good agreement between
the result (1) and the result (2) conﬁrms the validity of our analytic cross section formula. The φ1
and φ2 plots show correlated distributions. However, the agreement between the result (1) and
the result (3) indicates that the correlated distributions are not induced by the quantum eﬀects
of the intermediate weak bosons but by a kinematic eﬀect. The small discrepancies between the
result (1) and the result (3) in the ∆φ and φ+ plots come from the cos ∆φ and the cos φ+ terms in
eq. (3.10), respectively. The smallness of the discrepancies is as expected (see the discussion above
eq. (3.10)).
In the ∆φ and φ+ plots, the result (3) again shows correlated distributions, which
must be induced by a kinematic eﬀect. Therefore, the WBF sub-process produces the correlated
distributions in all of the azimuthal angle observables, however they are mainly induced by a
kinematic eﬀect. We note that the GF sub-process produces only ﬂat distributions in all of the
azimuthal angle observables, when the quantum eﬀects of the intermediate gluons are killed in the
same way as above. It can be concluded that the non-ﬂat distributions induced by a kinematic
eﬀect are a characteristic feature of the WBF sub-process.

We study how the azimuthal angle distributions depend on the triple Higgs self-coupling. We
have observed the kinematic eﬀect on the distributions in non-standard cases λh (cid:54)= 1, too, where λh
is the factor re-scaling the triple Higgs self-coupling. The three cases λh = 0, 1, 2 produce the similar
distributions in the azimuthal angle observables, when the quantum eﬀects of the intermediate weak
bosons are killed. In Figure 11 we show the normalised diﬀerential cross section as a function of
φ1,2 (left), ∆φ = φ1 − φ2 (middle) and φ+ = φ1 + φ2 (right) with three diﬀerent values of λh, the
blue solid curve: λh = 0, the black dashed curve: λh = 1 (the SM prediction), and the red solid
curve: λh = 2. The correlated distributions in the φ1,2 plot are completely induced by a kinematic
eﬀect. We ﬁnd that, when λh = 2, the coeﬃcient of the cos (φ1 − φ2) term (the second term in the
RHS of eq. (3.10)) is large enough to ﬂip the ∆φ distribution. The impact of a non-standard value
for λh (λh (cid:54)= 1) is again not so signiﬁcant. However, diﬀerently from the GF sub-process which
is actually the O(α2
s) correction to the inclusive GF sub-process gg → HH, the WBF sub-process
is a LO tree-level process and so the correlations should be used together with other observables,
such as the invariant mass of the Higgs boson pair, to probe λh.

4 Summary and discussion

In this paper, we have studied the azimuthal angle correlations of two jets in the production
of a Higgs boson pair plus two jets pp → HHjj. Based on the known fact that the azimuthal
angle correlations are induced by the quantum eﬀects of the two intermediate vector bosons in
vector boson fusion (VBF) sub-processes, we have calculated the amplitudes contributed from
only VBF Feynman diagrams. As VBF sub-processes, we have considered the gluon fusion (GF)
sα2) process at leading order (LO), and the weak boson
sub-process, which is an one-loop O(α4
fusion (WBF) sub-process, which is an O(α4) process at LO. We have used a helicity amplitude
technique for evaluating the VBF amplitudes. Based on the method presented in ref. [47], we
have divided a VBF amplitude into two amplitudes for oﬀ-shell vector boson emissions (q → qV ∗
or g → gV ∗) and one amplitude for the Higgs boson pair production by a fusion of the two
oﬀ-shell vector bosons (V ∗V ∗
→ HH), and presentd each of the three amplitudes in the helicity
basis. The quantum eﬀects of the intermediate vector bosons are still included correctly and are
expressed as the interference of the V ∗V ∗
→ HH amplitudes with various helicities of the vector
bosons. With this method, we have obtained the analytic cross section formula in a compact
form, from which we can easily make an expectation on the azimuthal angle correlations, both for
the GF sub-process and for the WBF sub-process. We have numerically compared our analytic
cross section formulas with the exact LO results and have observed the good agreement between
the two results both in the inclusive cross sections and in azimuthal angle distributions, after
the VBF cuts and the upper transverse momentum pT cut on the jets are imposed (For the
GF sub-process, the comparison is performed only in the large mt limit.). As azimuthal angle
observables, we have studied four observables: φ1, φ2, ∆φ = φ1 − φ2 and φ+ = φ1 + φ2, where φ1,2
are the azimuthal angles of the two jets measured from the production plane of the Higgs boson pair.

In the GF sub-process, using a ﬁnite mt value is found to be important to produce the
azimuthal angle correlations correctly. The GF sub-process exhibits large correlations in φ1,2
and ∆φ. The pT of the Higgs boson is found to be useful in controlling these correlations. The
correlation in ∆φ is enhanced when the pT of the Higgs boson is decreased and the correlations in
φ1,2 are enhanced when the pT of the Higgs boson is increased. We have found that the correlation

in φ+ is very small in most every case. The impact of a non-standard value for the triple Higgs
self-coupling on the correlations is found to be much smaller than that in other observables, such
as the invariant mass of the Higgs boson pair, of the inclusive process pp → HH.
In order to
study the impact of parity violation on the correlations, we have introduced two independent
phases ξ1,2 which parametrise the magnitude of parity violation in the process gg → HH, in a
way that ξ1 aﬀects the gg → HH amplitude for ∆λ = 0 helicity states, where ∆λ = λ1 − λ2
and λ1,2 are helicities of the gluons, and ξ2 aﬀects the amplitude for ∆λ = ±2 helicity states.
We have analytically shown that parity violation appears as peak shifts of the correlations and
that the peak shifts reﬂect only the magnitude of parity violation. We have also shown that ∆φ
is sensitive to ξ1, φ+ is sensitive to ξ2, and φ1,2 are sensitive to both of ξ1 and ξ2. Although
we are far less likely to be able to measure ξ2 in the φ+ distribution because of the very small
correlation in φ+, we may use φ1 and φ2 to probe ξ2 instead. While we can naively expect that the
azimuthal angle distributions in the WBF sub-process are almost ﬂat, we have actually observed
correlated (non-ﬂat) distributions. We have found that they are not induced by the quantum
eﬀects of the intermediate weak bosons but by a kinematic eﬀect. Since we do not ﬁnd the similar
kinematic eﬀect in the GF sub-process, we conclude that this is a characteristic feature of the
WBF sub-process. The impact of a non-standard value for the triple Higgs self-coupling is not so
signiﬁcant in the WBF sub-process, too.

The parton level event samples of the process pp → HHjj are exclusively generated and each of
the two outgoing partons is identiﬁed as a jet in our numerical studies. When more realistic event
generations are intended to be performed, merging the parton level event samples with the leading
logarithmic parton shower [80–82] and subsequently proceeding to a hadronisation procedure
will be a promising approach. However, a careful merging procedure is required for correctly
reproducing the azimuthal angle correlations after the merging procedure, because the correlations
studied in this paper are completely process dependent (pp → HHjj) and those process dependent
angular correlations are not described correctly by the parton shower. Contamination from the
parton shower may lead to a wrong prediction [83].

The azimuthal angle correlations revealed in this paper will help the analyses of the process
pp → HHjj at the LHC. Since the production cross section of the process pp → HHjj is small, we

The azimuthal angle correlations are obviously a part of the process dependent information. It is a
known issue that separating the contributions coming from the GF sub-process and those coming
from the WBF sub-process is diﬃcult in the production of a Higgs boson pair plus two jets [23].
One possible application of the correlations is to help disentangling the GF sub-process and the
WBF sub-process by using the fact that these two sub-processes exhibit diﬀerent correlations, as
shown in Figure 12. We have studied only the signal processes in this paper and so the impact of
the correlations in a realistic situation is not so clear yet. The fully automated event generation for
loop induced processes is now available in MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [67, 68]. This achievement will
activate phenomenological studies of the process. We hope that further phenomenological studies
including the uses of the azimuthal angle correlations will be performed both by theorists and by
experimentalists.
