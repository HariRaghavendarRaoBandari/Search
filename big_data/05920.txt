Abstract

Dielectronic recombination (DR) is a key atomic process which aﬀects the spectroscopic diag-

nostic modelling of tungsten, most of whose ionization stages will be found somewhere in the ITER

fusion reactor: in the edge, divertor, or core plasma. Accurate DR data is sparse while complete DR

coverage is unsophisticated (e.g. average-atom or Burgess General Formula) as illustrated by the

large uncertainties which currently exist in the tungsten ionization balance. To this end, we present

a series of partial ﬁnal-state-resolved and total DR rate coeﬃcients for W73+ to W56+ Tungsten

ions. This is part of a wider eﬀort within The Tungsten Project to calculate accurate dielectronic

recombination rate coeﬃcients for the tungsten isonuclear sequence for use in collisional-radiative

modelling of ﬁnite-density tokamak plasmas. The recombination rate coeﬃcients have been cal-

culated with autostructure using kappa-averaged relativistic wavefunctions in level resolution

(intermediate coupling) and conﬁguration resolution (conﬁguration average). The results are avail-

able from OPEN-ADAS according to the adf09 and adf48 standard formats. Comparison with

previous calculations of total DR rate coeﬃcients for W63+ and W56+ yield agreement to within

20% and 10%, respectively, at peak temperature. It is also seen that the J¨uttner correction to the

Maxwell distribution has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the ionization balance of tungsten at the highest

charge states, changing both the peak abundance temperatures and the ionization fractions of

several ions.

INTRODUCTION

ITER [1] is posited to be the penultimate step in realizing a nuclear fusion power plant. It

will be signiﬁcantly larger than present machines, such as JET, in terms of plasma volume,

core temperature, and physical size [2]. Beryllium coated tiles will line the wall of the main

reactor vessel due to their low erosion rate and the low tritium retention of Be. Tungsten

(Z = 74) will be used in regions of high power-loads, such as the divertor chamber at the

base of the main vessel, and it is also resistant to tritiation [3]. On the downside, such

high-Z elements are eﬃcient radiators and must be kept to a minimum in the main plasma

to avoid degrading its conﬁnement. Because of this, JET has undergone a major upgrade

to an ITER-like wall to act as a test-bed. Control of tungsten sources and its subsequent

transport are under intensive study [4]. Tungsten is the highest-Z metal in widespread

use in a tokamak. Prior to the installation of the ITER-like wall at JET, molybdenum

(Z = 42) was the highest-Z metal in widespread use, at Alcator C-Mod. Like tungsten,

molybdenum has a low tritium absorption rate [5]. However, molybdenum has a signiﬁcantly

lower melting point than tungsten, and also transmutes to technetium, complicating reactor

decommissioning.

Most of the tungsten isonuclear sequence needs to be covered by non-LTE plasma mod-

elling, from its initial sputtering from surfaces through the edge, divertor and core plasmas.

One of the most basic quatities is the tungsten ionization balance: a measure of the domi-

nant ionization stages as a function of temperature and density. While our understanding

of the ionization rates required appears to be in reasonable order [6], the same is not true

for the competing dielectronic plus radiative recombination rates (DR+RR). In Figure 1 we

compare the zero-density ionization balance for tungsten obtained using two diﬀerent sets of

recombination data [7, 8] and the same ionization rate coeﬃcients, of [6]. It can be seen that

there are large discrepancies between the peak temperatures of individual ionization stages,

as well as the fractional population of said ionization stage. The dielectronic recombination

data of P¨utterich et al [7] was calculated with ADPAK [9, 10] using an average-atom model

and it was scaled by the authors in order to improve agreement between theory and experi-

ment with regards to the shape of the fractional abundances of W22+–W55+. The DR data

of Foster [8] used the Burgess General Formula [11]. Both used the same scaled hydrogenic

radiative recombination data. Clearly, more reliable DR data is required.

2

Another issue is that the magnetic fusion plasmas cannot be taken to be a zero-density

one. The true ionization balance is density dependent and the corresponding density depen-

dent (eﬀective) ionization and recombination rate coeﬃcients are obtained from collisional-

radiative modelling. The ionization rate coeﬃcients are much less sensitive to density eﬀects

than the recombination ones because dielectronic recombination takes place through and

to high-Rydberg states. Therefore, partial ﬁnal-state-resolved rate coeﬃcients are needed.

Even where detailed calculations have been made, the data available is usually in the form

of zero-density totals, i.e. summed-over all ﬁnal states. As such, it is diﬃcult to use such

data for collisional-radiative modelling in reliable manner.

Detailed calculations have been performed for a select few ions of tungsten. However,

these are very sparse, and tend to be for closed-shell ions which are important for plasma

diagnostics. The most complicated exception to this to date is our work on the open f-

shell: W20+,18+ (4d10 4f q, q = 8, 10)[12, 13]. Data for these ions were calculated using an

upgraded version of autostructure designed to handle the increased complexity of the

problem. The hullac [14] and the Cowan code [15] have been used by Safronova et al [16–

20] to calculate DR rate coeﬃcients for W5+, W28+, W46+, W63+, and W64+, respectively.

Behar et al [21] and Peleg et al [22] have also used these codes for W46+,W64+, and W56+,

respectively. In addition, the Flexible Atomic Code (fac, [23]) has been used by Meng et

al [24] and Li et al [25] to calculate DR rate coeﬃcients for W47+ and W29+, respectively.

Just recently, Wu et al [26] have calculated zero-density total DR rate coeﬃcients for W37+

– W46+ using fac.

In contrast, partial RR rate coeﬃcients have been calculated for the entire isonuclear

sequence of Tungsten, and the results presented in a series of papers, by Trzhaskovskaya et

al [27–30]. The authors used a Dirac-Fock method with fully relativistic wavefunctions, and

included contributions from all signiﬁcant radiation multipoles. The authors state that the

majority of their RR rate coeﬃcients were calculated to < 1% numerical accuracy. However,

for outer shell RR and high temperatures, their rate coeﬃcients were calculated to < 5%

[27]. The authors also present total RR rate coeﬃcients summed up to n = 20 and ℓ = 19.

In order to address this situation, we have embarked on a programme of work, as part

of The Tungsten Project, which aims to calculate partial ﬁnal-state resolved DR rate coef-

ﬁcients for use in collisional-radiative modelling with ADAS [31] for the entire isonuclear

sequence of tungsten. For completeness and ease of integration within ADAS, we compute

3

the corresponding RR data at the same time. Zero-density totals are readily obtained from

the archived data. The work presented here covers W73+ to W56+.

On a practical technical point, the names of various elements in the periodic table are

not particularly helpful to label ionization stages of a large isonuclear sequence such as

tungsten. Thus, we will not refer to such species by a name such as Pr-like.

Instead,

we adopt a notation based on the number of electrons possessed by a particular ion. For

example, H-like (1 electron) W73+ will be referred to as 01-like, Ne-like (10 electrons) W64+

will be referred to as 10-like, and Pr-like (59 electrons) W15+ as 59-like. This mirrors our

database archiving.

The outline of this paper is as follows: in Sec. II we outline the background theory for

our description of DR and RR, as encapsulated in the autostructure code, and give con-

sideration to the delivery of data in a manner appropriate for collisional-radiative modelling.

In Sec. III, we describe our calculations for 00-like to 18-like ions. In Sec. IV, we present

our results for DR/RR rate coeﬃcients and compare them with those published previously,

where available; then we look at how the zero-density ionization balance of tungsten changes

on using our new recombination data. We conclude with some ﬁnal remarks, and outline

future calculations.

II. THEORY

We use the distorted-wave atomic package autostructure [32–34]. For recombination,

autostructure makes use of the independent processes and isolated resonance approxi-

mations [35]. Then, the partial DR rate coeﬃcient DRαz+1

f ν , from some initial state ν of ion

X +z+1 to a ﬁnal state f of ion X +z, can be written as

where the Aa are the autoionization rates, Ar are the radiative rates, ωj is the statistical

said channels.

IH is the ionization energy of the hydrogen atom, kB is the Boltzmann

are given by [37]. The numerical approaches to converging the quadrature accurately and

eﬃciently have been given previously [36].

At high temperatures (>

∼ 109 K) relativistic corrections to the usual Maxwell-Boltzmann

distribution become important. The resultant Maxwell-J¨uttner distribution [38] reduces

simply to an extra multiplicative factor, Fr(θ), to be applied to the Maxwell-Boltzmann

partial rate coeﬃcients:

Fr(θ) = s πθ

(3)

where θ = α2kBT /2IH, α is the ﬁne-structure constant and K2 is the modiﬁed Bessel

function of the second kind. This factor is normally consistently omitted from data archived

in ADAS, being subsequently applied if required in extreme cases. However, since it has a

non-negligible aﬀect at the temperature of peak abundance for the highest charge states we

consistently include it for all tungsten DR and RR data and ﬂag this in the archived ﬁles.

Plasma densities in magnetic fusion reactors vary greatly. For ITER, the plasma densities
are thought to vary from 1010–1013 cm−3 for the edge plasma, to ∼ 1014 cm−3 for the
core plasma, reaching ∼ 1015 cm−3 for the divertor plasma. Because of these densities,
the coronal picture breaks down: capture into an excited state does not cascade down to

the ground uninterrupted.

Instead, further collisions take place, leading in particular to

stepwise ionization, for example. This strongly suppresses coronal total recombination rate

coeﬃcients. Collisional-radiative (CR) modelling of the excited-state population distribution

is necessary. This leads to density-dependent eﬀective ionization and recombination rate

coeﬃcients. A key ingredient for CR modelling is partial ﬁnal-state-resolved recombination

data. Our approach for light systems is detailed in [39] and [36] for DR and RR, respectively.

Low-lying ﬁnal-states are fully level-resolved while higher-lying states are progressively (nℓ-

and n-) bundled over their total quantum numbers, whilst retaining their level parentage.

5

Initial ground and metastable levels are also fully-resolved. The data are archived in ADAS

standard formats, viz. adf09 (DR) and adf48 (RR). One does not need to progress far into

the M-shell for the number of such ﬁnal states to become unmanageable by CR modelling and

further bundling is required. This is carried-out most eﬃciently as the partial recombination

rate coeﬃcients are calculated and leads to much more compact adf09 and adf48 ﬁles. We

ﬁnd it necessary to bundle over all ﬁnal recombined levels within a conﬁguration. For such

conﬁgurations which straddle the ionization limit we include the statistical fractions within

the adf ﬁles. The initial ground and metastable levels remain level-resolved, as does the

calculation of autoionizing branching ratios (ﬂuorescence yields). We describe such a mixed

resolution scheme as a ‘hybrid’ approach and the adf ﬁles are labelled accordingly. All

resultant adf09 and adf48 ﬁles are made available via OPEN-ADAS [40].

III. CALCULATIONS

All rates and cross sections were determined on solving the kappa-averaged quasi-one-

electron Dirac equation for the large and small components utilizing the Thomas-Fermi-

Dirac-Amaldi model potential [41] with unit scaling parameters to represent the N- and

(N + 1)-electron ions. We utilized several coupling schemes. Conﬁguration average (CA)

was used to give a quick overview of the problem. This neglects conﬁguration mixing and

relativistic interactions in the Hamiltonian. LS-coupling (LS) allows for conﬁguration mix-

ing but tends to overestimate it in such highly-charged ions because relativistic interactions

push interacting terms further apart. Thus, our main body of data is calculated in in-

termediate coupling (IC). For the K-shell ions, we included valence-valence two-body ﬁne
structure interactions. These gave rise to a ∼7% increase in the total DR rate coeﬃcients
for 01-like and 02-like ions at high temperatures. We neglect these interactions for the L-

and M-shell ions since the increase in the total DR rate coeﬃcient is < 1%.

A. DR

It is necessary to include all dominant DR reactions illustrated by Eq.(1). The initial

state ν is taken to be the ground state. Metastables are unlikely to be important at such

high charge states. The driving reactions are the autoionizing states produced by one-

6

electron promotions from the ground conﬁguration, with a corresponding capture of the

continuum electron. We label these core-excitations by the initial (n) and ﬁnal (n′) principal

quantum numbers of the promoted electron, and include all corresponding sub-shells (ℓ-

values). The dominant contributions come from ∆n = 0 (n = n′) and ∆n = 1 (n′ =

n + 1), being well separated in energy/temperature. Contributions from ∆n > 1 tend to be

suppressed by autoionization into excited states, as represented by the sum over Aa in the

denominator of (1). The outermost shell dominates but the ∆n = 1 inner-shell promotion
(n = n′ − 1) can be signiﬁcant when there are few outer n-shell electrons. As their number
increases, core re-arranging autoionizing transitions suppress this inner-shell contribution.

These core-excitations deﬁne a set of N-electron conﬁgurations to which continuum and

Rydberg electrons are coupled.

Based-on these promotion rules, the core-excitations considered for each ion (W73+ to

W56+) are listed in Table I. The calculations were carried-out ﬁrst in CA to determine

which excitations are dominant. We omitted core-excitations that contribute < 1% to the

sum total of all DR core-excitation rate coeﬃcients spanning the ADAS temperature grid.
This grid covers 10z2–2×106z2 K, where z is the residual charge of the initial target ion. DR
for the dominant core-excitations is then calculated in IC. The nℓ Rydberg electron, in the

sum over autoionizing states j, is calculated explicitly for each principal quantum number

up to n = 25 and then on a quasi-logarithmic n-mesh up to n = 999. The partial DR

rate coeﬃcient tabulation is based on this mesh of n-values. Total (zero-density) DR rate

coeﬃcients are obtained by interpolation and quadrature of these partials. The maximum

Rydberg orbital angular momentum (ℓ) is taken to be such that the total rate coeﬃcients

are converged to better than 1% over the ADAS temperature range. Radiative transitions

of the Rydberg electron to ﬁnal states with principal quantum number greater than the

core-excitations’ are described hydrogenically. Those into the core are described by a set of

(N + 1)-electron conﬁgurations which are generated by adding another core electron orbital

to all N-electron conﬁgurations describing the core-excitations.

In the case of ∆n > 1

core-excitations this also allows for dielectronic capture into the core.

To make clear to the complete set of conﬁgurations included for a typical calculation,
we give a list of conﬁgurations used to calculate DR rate coeﬃcients for 14-like 3 − 3 and
3 − 4 core-excitations in Table II. We have marked also, with an *, conﬁgurations which
were added to allow for the dominant conﬁguration mixing within a complex by way of the

7

‘one up, one down rule’. For example, the conﬁguration 3s3p23d strongly mixes with 3p4

and 3s23d2.

B. RR

The partial RR rate coeﬃcients were calculated in a similar, but simpliﬁed fashion, to

∆n = 0 DR, viz., the N-electron target conﬁgurations were restricted to those which mixed

with the ground and the (N + 1)-electron conﬁgurations were these N-electron conﬁgura-

tions with an additional core electron. The Rydberg nℓ-values were again calculated for

each n up to n = 25 and then on the same n-mesh as used for DR, up to n = 999, with
ℓ = 0 − 10, relativistically. At high-T (> 109) K, many multipoles contribute to the pho-
toionization/recombination at correspondingly high energies [42]. We included up to E40 in

CA and E40/M39 in the IC calculations, which is suﬃcient to converge the total RR rate

coeﬃcients to < 1% over the ADAS temperature range. A non-relativistic (dipole) top-up

was then used to include up to ℓ = 150 to converge the low-temperature RR rate coeﬃcients

— relativistic eﬀects being negligible there. This approach is suﬃcient to calculate the total

RR rate coeﬃcients to better than 1%, numerically.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this section we present the results of our DR and RR rate coeﬃcient calculations for

00-like to 18-like. In our plots we show the tungsten fractional peak abundance curves from

P¨utterich et al [7] to give an indication of the relevant temperatures for application purposes.

At these temperatures, RR is dominated by capture into the lowest available nl-subshell. We

consider the DR rate coeﬃcients ﬁrst, and look at the K, L, and M shells in turn. Next, we

consider the RR rate coeﬃcients, and assess their importance relative to DR. We compare

our results with others, where possible. Finally, we look at the eﬀect on the zero-density

ionization balance of tungsten when using our new data.

8

A. K-shell DR

The DR rate coeﬃcients for 01 and 02-like are very small compared to RR. The reason

for this is that the RR rate coeﬃcient scales as z (residual charge) while the DR rate coeﬃ-

cient here scales as z−3, being proportional to the dielectronic capture rate (the ﬂuorescence

yields are close to unity due to the z4 scaling of the radiative rates and the z0 (= 1) of the

autoionization.) In Figure 2 we have plotted the DR and RR rate coeﬃcients for 01-like.

In the top subplot, we show the individual contributions from each DR core-excitation, and

RR. The ionization balance for 01-like, calculated using the scaled recombination data of

P¨utterich et al [7] and the ionization data of Loch et al [6], is plotted also for reference. In

the bottom subplot, we have plotted the cumulative sum of each contribution to the total

recombination rate coeﬃcient. This was calculated by taking the fraction of the largest con-

tribution to the total recombination rate coeﬃcient. The next curve is calculated by adding

the ﬁrst and second largest contributions together, and taking the fraction of this to the

total recombination rate coeﬃcient, and so on. It can be seen that the total recombination

rate coeﬃcient is dominated by RR, it being at least two orders of magnitude larger than

DR at any temperature of interest. Comparatively, the DR ∆n = 1 core-excitations for 01-

and 02-like are a factor 10 larger than their corresponding ∆n = 2 core-excitations. This is

due to the (core) n−3 scaling of the autoionization rate, rather than ∆n = 1 autoionization

into excited states for the ∆n = 2. Finally, in Figure 3 we compare the total 01- and 02-like

DR rate coeﬃcients. The 02-like is roughly a factor of two larger because there are two

K-shell electrons available to promote.

B. L-shell DR

In Figure 4 we have plotted the DR and RR rate coeﬃcients for 03-like in a similar

manner to Figure 2. The RR rate coeﬃcient drops by a factor of two due to the K-shell being

closed while dominant (for DR) contributions arise from the 2-2 and 2-3 core-excitations.
Nevertheless, RR still contributes ∼ 60 − 90% of the total recombination rate coeﬃcient
around the temperature of peak abundance. As the L-shell ﬁlls, the total RR rate coeﬃcient

decreases due to decreasing L-shell vacancy (and charge somewhat) while the DR increases

correspondingly due to the increasing number of electrons available to be promoted. The

9

two become comparable at 10-like (see Figure 5) when the RR can only start to ﬁll the

M-shell. In Figures 6 and 7 we have plotted the DR rate coeﬃcients for the 2-2 and 2-3 core

excitations respectively, with the former covering 03- to 09-like and the latter covering 03-

to 10-like. The 2-2 core-excitation provides the largest contribution to the total DR rate

coeﬃcients when ﬁlling the 2s shell. After the 2p subshell is half ﬁlled (06-like), the 2-2 DR

rate coeﬃcient decreases gradually, being overtaken by the 2-3 core-excitation. The 2-4 core-

excitation provides only a small contribution in 03- and 04-like (< 1% at peak abundance),

and was hence neglected from 05-like onwards. In 10-like, the 2-4 core excitation was re-

introduced as a consistency check now that the 2-2 is closed, however, it still provides a
minimal contribution of ∼5% around peak abundance.

C. M-shell DR

A temperature of 26keV (3 × 108K) corresponds to the peak abundance of 10-like W.
Higher charge states will exist, with increasingly small fractional abundance, but may be

seen spectroscopically. The M-shell is perhaps the deepest shell in tungsten that ITER will

be able to access routinely. The M-shell is also the regime in which RR increasingly gives
way to DR, contributing ∼40% of the total recombination rate coeﬃcient in 11-like, and
decreasing to ∼15% in 18-like, around the temperature of peak abundance (see Figures 8
and 9, respectively). The inner-shell 2-3 core-excitation provides the largest contribution
to the total DR rate coeﬃcient in 11-like (∼ 40%), however, this is quickly overtaken by
the ∆n=0 and outer shell ∆n=1 core-excitations of 3-3 and 3-4, respectively. Again, this

can be understood in terms of a simple occupancy/vacancy argument. In addition, the 2-3

is increasingly suppressed by core re-arrangement autoionizing transitions, viz. an M-shell

electron drops down into the L-shell and ejects another M-shell electron. This process is

independent of the Rydberg-n, unlike the initial dielectronic capture. The reduction of the

2-3 core-excitation DR with increasing M-shell occupation is shown in Figure 10, where we

have plotted the 2-3 DR rate coeﬃcients for 11-like to 18-like.

The outer-shell ∆n=0 (3-3) and ∆n=1 (3-4) core-excitations provide the largest contri-

butions to the total recombination rate coeﬃcients from 12-like onwards. In Figure 11, we

have plotted the (3pq) 3-3 core-excitations for 11-like to 18-like, where there is competi-

tion between 3p occupancy and 3p vacancy. It can be seen that the 3-3 contribution grows

10

steadily up to 15 and 16-like reaching a maximum value there. The rate coeﬃcient then

begins to decrease for 17- and 18-like as the 3p shell closes, leaving only 3d vacancies. In

Figure 12 we have plotted the 3-4 DR rate coeﬃcients for 11-like to 18-like. The 3-4 rate

coeﬃcients increase simply with increasing 3p occupancy.

The ∆n=2 (3-5) core-excitation again provides only a small contribution throughout 11-
to 18-like. This contribution is at its smallest for 11-like (Figure 8), contributing ∼ 1% to
the total recombination rate coeﬃcient. As with 3-4, the 3-5 DR rate coeﬃcient increases
up to 17- and 18-like, but still only contributes ∼ 5% for the ﬁnal ion. Despite the small
contribution, we opted to keep the 3-5 core-excitation as the 2-3 one decreases rapidly with

the ﬁlling of the 3p shell.

D. Relativistic Conﬁguration Mixing in DR

Comparing total DR rate coeﬃcients, although convenient, can be somewhat mislead-

ing since non-relativistic conﬁguration mixing and relativistic (e.g. spin-orbit) mixing are

described by unitary transformations of the initial basis wavefunctions. For example, in

Figure 13 we show the total DR rate coeﬃcients for the 16-like 3-4 core-excitation calcu-

lated in IC and CA. It can be seen the agreement between IC and CA is very good, being
∼ 10% around the temperature of peak abundance. Now, if we consider a set of partial
DR rate coeﬃcients for 16-like 3-4, we can see the agreement between IC and CA is much

worse. In Figure 14 we have plotted the partial DR rate coeﬃcients for 16-like 3-4, capture

to n = 5. The best agreement is for recombination into the 5f , with IC and CA diﬀering by
∼ 5%. The worst agreement is seen for recombination into 5p, where the IC and CA rate
coeﬃcients diﬀer by ∼ 33% at peak abundance. Agreement is no better for 5s, 5d, and 5g,
where the IC and CA rate coeﬃcients diﬀer by ∼ 28%, ∼ 19%, and ∼ 18% respectively.

The disagreement between partial DR rate coeﬃcients calculated in IC and CA is even

more apparent when considering the 3-3 core-excitation. In Figure 15 we have plotted the

partial DR rate coeﬃcients for 16-like 3-3, capture to n = 20. The best agreement occurs

for 20p and 20d, where the partials diﬀer by < 10% at peak abundance. The same cannot
be said for 20s, 20f , and 20g, where the IC and CA results diﬀer by ∼ 30%, ∼ 72%, and
∼ 51% respectively. These diﬀerences highlight the importance of relativistic mixing for a
heavy atom such as tungsten. This eﬀect is not conﬁned to 16-like, and occurs for all ions

11

considered in this work. Its subsequent propagation through collisional-radiative modelling

is a topic for future study.

E. Comparison with other DR work

With the exception of closed-shell ions, not much DR rate coeﬃcient data has been

calculated for the ions W73+ to W56+. As ITER will have an operating temperature of up to
∼ 26keV (∼ 3×108K), the reactor will be able to access to about 10-like W64+. In Tables IV
and V we compare our total DR rate coeﬃcients for 10-like with those of Behar et al [21] and

Safronova et al [20] respectively, both of whom used the hullac [14] code. Agreement with
the results of Behar et al is generally good, being ∼ 10% near peak abundance, while low
temperatures illustrate the characteristic sensitivity of DR rate coeﬃcients to near-threshold

resonances. However, a signiﬁcant diﬀerence is noted between these two sets of results and
those of Safronova et al , where our DR rate coeﬃcients are larger by ∼50% for temperatures
> 2 × 108K. The origin of this diﬀerence is currently unknown. In Table VI we compare
our 18-like total DR rate coeﬃcients with the hullac ones of Peleg et al [22]. Agreement
is better in this case over a wider range of temperatures, being <
∼10% at peak abundance.

F. RR

In Figure 16 we show our total RR rate coeﬃcients from 00-like to 18-like calculated

in IC. These include all multipoles up to E40/M39 and the J¨uttner relativistic correction.

The pattern of curves seen corresponds to the ﬁlling of the K-shell and then the L-/M-

shell boundary, as noted above. As mentioned previously, Trzhaskovskaya et al [27–30]

have calculated an extensive set of partial and ‘total’ (summed to n = 20, ℓ = 19) RR

rate coeﬃcients for the whole tungsten isonuclear sequence. Their calculations were fully

relativistic, extending to n = 20, ℓ = 19. Comparatively, our autostructure calculations

extend to n = 999 and ℓ = 150, where values up to ℓ = 10 were treated relativistically in

the kappa-averaged approximation. A non-relativistic dipole top-up was then used to cover

the remaining ℓ values which become important at low (non-relativistic) temperatures. In

Table III we compare the RR rate coeﬃcients of Trzhaskovskaya et al [27] for 00-like (fully

stripped) to ours over log T (K) of 3.0 to 10.0. In this table, we have given our rate coeﬃcients

12

when summed up to n = 999 and ℓ = 150, as well as the rate coeﬃcients when summed

up to n = 20 and ℓ = 19. In the case where we do not truncate n and ℓ we see very large
diﬀerences at low temperatures (> 100% for log T (K) ≤ 3.5.) This diﬀerence decreases
steadily until ∼ 109K, where it then begins to increase again. When we truncate our n and
ℓ values to match Trzhaskovskaya et al , we ﬁnd excellent agreement between the two data

sets for log T (K) < 9.5 (< 1%). Above log T (K) = 9.5 we note a slight drift away from the
results of Trzhaskovskaya et al , reaching ∼ 10% at the highest temperature log T (K)=10.0.
This is likely due to the use of kappa-average wavefunctions by autostructure, assuming

< 1% accuracy in the results of Trzhaskovskaya et al still. The kappa-average approximation

begins to break down at high temperatures, or rather at the corresponding high electron

energies which contribute at such T . The underlying photoionization cross sections are

falling-oﬀ rapidly in magnitude and such small quatities become increasingly sensitive to

the kappa-average approximation. Such a diﬀerence at these temperatures should be of no

importance to modelling. But, it is useful to have a complete set of consistent partial RR

data to complement the DR data for collisional-radiative modelling with ADAS. As already

noted, RR is most important for the highest few ionization stages. By 10-like, the total DR

rate coeﬃcient is comparable to RR at the temperature of peak abundance. By 18-like, the
RR rate coeﬃcient contributes only ≈ 10% to the total rate coeﬃcient at peak abundance.

G. Comparison with P¨utterich et al & Foster DR+RR

The P¨utterich et al [7] DR data is ADPAK [9, 10], which uses an average-atom method,

and was further scaled for W22+–W55+. The Foster [8] DR data was calculated using the

Burgess General Formula [11]. Both use the same ADAS RR data, which is scaled hydro-

genic. We now compare our DR+RR results with those P¨utterich et al and Foster.

In

order to do this, we omit the J¨uttner relativistic correction from our recombination rate

coeﬃcients, as they did. On comparing our recombination rate coeﬃcients with P¨utterich et

al , we ﬁnd that there are multiple ions where there is good agreement. For example, in

Figure 19 we have plotted the 06-like recombination rate coeﬃcients for P¨utterich et al ,

and our DR and RR rate coeﬃcients and their sum. We ﬁnd our rate coeﬃcients are in

agreement with those of P¨utterich et al to <10% at peak abundance. Some ions are in

poor agreement. In Figure 20 we compare our recombination rate coeﬃcients with those of

13

P¨utterich et al for 10-like. The agreement is very poor at peak abundance with a diﬀerence

of >40%. For the Foster data, good agreement is again seen in multiple ions. In Figure 21

we plot our DR, RR, and total recombination rate coeﬃcients along with Foster’s total

(DR+RR) rate coeﬃcients for 06-like. The diﬀerence between ours and Foster’s rate coeﬃ-

cient is even smaller than found with P¨utterich et al , being <1% at peak abundance. The

largest disagreement between ours and Foster’s data occurs for 16-like. We have plotted ours

and Foster’s recombination rate coeﬃcients for 16-like in Figure 22. Poor agreement can be

seen across a wide temperature range. At peak abundance, ours and Foster’s recombination

rate coeﬃcients diﬀer by >40%.

The agreement between our present total DR plus RR rate coeﬃcients and those of Foster

[8] is similar to the agreement between ours and those of P¨utterich et al [7] for 01-like to

11-like, with the diﬀerences being <30% near peak abundance. For 12-like and beyond, the

P¨utterich et al recombination data is in better agreement with ours, while Foster’s data is

consistently smaller than ours. As previously noted, DR becomes increasingly important

as we move from the L-shell to the M-shell. Thus, crude/simple methods such as average-

atom and the Burgess General Formula can give good descriptions of DR, but also very

poor ones. Also, they are not readily adaptable to delivering the partial ﬁnal-state-resolved

data required for collisional-radiative modelling, although the Burgess General Program

underlying his General Formula can do so.

H.

Ionization balance

In order to compare the eﬀect of our new recombination data, on the zero-density ioniza-

tion balance, with that of P¨utterich et al [7], we replaced their recombination data with our

new DR+RR data for 00-like to 18-like tungsten. In Figure 17, we compare the ionization

balance obtained with this new data set with the original one of P¨utterich et al . A large

discrepancy is immediately apparent, namely that our peak abundance fractions have shifted

relative to those of P¨utterich et al . This has a simple explanation, in that our data has the

J¨uttner relativistic correction applied. By excluding this correction, our ionization fraction

moves into better agreement with the P¨utterich et al fraction, as seen in Figure 18.

Electric and magnetic multipole radiation contributions to the RR rate coeﬃcients be-

come important at high temperatures [42].

In Figure 23 we have plotted the ionization

14

balance using RR rate coeﬃcients where only electric dipole radiation is included, and us-

ing RR rate coeﬃcients where electric and magnetic multipoles up to E40 and M39 have

been included. The inclusion of higher multipoles increases the peak abundance tempera-

ture of the highest-charge ions as expected, however, the peak abundance temperature only
changes by ∼ 4% for 01- and 02-like. This shift decreases rapidly to zero towards 18-like as
DR becomes dominant over RR.

V. CONCLUSION

Large uncertainties exist in the tungsten ionization balance over a wide range of tem-

peratures (charge-states) found in magnetic fusion plasmas. This ranges from the cool edge

plasma right through to the hot core plasma. The cause is the simpliﬁed treatment of DR,

using either the average-atom or Burgess General Formula approaches. We have embarked

on a program of work to address this deﬁciency.

In this paper, we have reported on the

calculation of CA & IC DR and RR rate coeﬃcients for 00-like to 18-like tungsten (W74+ to

W56+ ions) using autostructure. In particular, we retain the partial ﬁnal-state-resolved

coeﬃcients in a suitable form (adf09 and adf48 ﬁles) which are necessary for the collisional-

radiative modelling of tungsten ions at the densities found in magnetic fusion plasmas.

We have compared our total DR rate coeﬃcients to the results of calculations provided by

Behar et al

[21] and Safronova et al

[20] for 10-like, and Peleg et al

[22] for 18-like tungsten.

Good agreement is found between our rate coeﬃcients and those of [21] and [22] for 10-like
and 18-like, diﬀering by ∼ 10% at the peak abundance temperature. Poor agreement was
found when comparing with the 10-like results of [20], with diﬀerences of ∼50%.

RR dominates the recombination of the highest charge states (K-shell ions) but DR

becomes increasingly important as the L-shell ﬁlls and by 10-like it is (just) larger around

the temperatures of peak abundance. For more lowly ionized tungsten, beyond 10-like, the

importance of RR rapidly diminishes.

We have calculated a new zero-density ionization balance for tungsten by replacing the

P¨utterich et al

[7] recombination with our new DR+RR data for 00-like to 18-like. Large

diﬀerences result, both in the peak abundance temperatures and the ionization fractions,

due largely to our inclusion of the J¨uttner relativistic correction to the Maxwell-Boltzmann

electron distribution. A further, smaller, diﬀerence arises from our inclusion of high elec-

15

tric and magnetic multipole radiation which causes a slight shift in the peak abundance

temperatures of higher ionization stages (in particular, K shell ions).

This paper has presented the ﬁrst step in a larger programme of work within The Tungsten

Project. The next paper will cover DR/RR calculations for 19-like to 36-like tungsten, with

the possibility of modelling a density-dependent ionization balance. Our ultimate goal within

The Tungsten Project is to calculate partial and total DR/RR rate coeﬃcients for the entire

isoelectronic sequence of tungsten. This will replace the less reliable data used at present,

which is mostly based-on average-atom and the Burgess General Formula (for DR), and

which gives rise to large uncertainties in the tungsten ionization balance.

FIG. 2. 01-like DR rate coeﬃcients for core-excitations 1-2 and 1-3, along with the RR rate

coeﬃcient, and the sum total of these. The solid black curve is the fractional abundance for 01-like

as calculated using P¨utterich et al ’s [7] scaled recombination data, and Loch et al ’s [6] ionization

data. The bottom subﬁgure is the cumulative sum of these diﬀerent contributions (see text for an

explanation).

FIG. 3. DR rate coeﬃcients for 1-2, ∆n = 1 core-excitation for 01- and 02-like

FIG. 13. Total DR rate coeﬃcients for 16-like 3-4. The bottom plot shows the ratio of the IC

coeﬃcients to CA. The dotted line indicates a ratio of unity.

31

FIG. 14. Partial DR rate coeﬃcients for 16-like 3-4 capture to n = 5 for subshells 5s − 5g. The
red curves correspond to the CA calculation, while the blue correspond to IC.

FIG. 15. Partial DR rate coeﬃcients for 16-like 3-3 capture to n = 20 for subshells 20s − 20g. The
red curves correspond to the CA calculation, while the blue correspond to IC.

32

FIG. 16. Total RR rate coeﬃcients for 00- to 18-like. The top curve is 00-like, and the curves

below it are 01-like down to 18-like. All this work.

FIG. 17. Zero-density fractional abundances of tungsten ionization stages, calculated using

P¨utterich et al [7] recombination data (red, solid curves) and the present recombination data

(blue, dashed curves). The black curves, from right to left, indicate 10-like and 18-like. Both use

the ionization rate coeﬃcients from Loch et al [6].
