THE CLASS OF LUCAS-LEHMER POLYNOMIALS.

PIERLUIGI VELLUCCI, ALBERTO MARIA BERSANI

Abstract. In this paper we introduce a new sequence of polynomials,
which follow the same recursive rule of the well-known Lucas-Lehmer in-
teger sequence. We show the most important properties of this sequence,
relating them to the Chebyshev polynomials of the ﬁrst and second kind.

1. Introduction

In this paper we study a class of polynomials Ln(x) = L2

n−1(x)− 2, which,
at the best of our knowledge, are here introduced for the ﬁrst time, created by
means of the same iterative formula used to build the well-known Lucas-Lehmer
sequence, employed in primality tests [18, 17, 21, 6, 16].
It is clearly crucial
to choose the ﬁrst term of the polynomial sequence. In this paper we consider
L0 = x.

In this paper we show some properties of these polynomials, in particular
discussing the link among the Lucas-Lehmer polynomials and the Chebyshev
polynomials of the ﬁrst and second kind [2, 12, 22]. The Chebyshev polynomials
are well-known and, although they have been known and studied for a long
time, continue to play an important role in recent advances in many areas of
mathematics such as Algebra, Numerical Analysis, Diﬀerential Equations and
Number Theory (see, for instance:
[1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 19, 23, 26, 4]) and new
other properties of theirs continue to be discovered ([3, 7, 8, 11]).

In particular, in the spirit of some existing results on the Chebyshev poly-
nomials and the nested square roots (see, for example, [20, 25]), we show that
the zeros of the Lucas-Lehmer polynomials can be written in terms of nested
radicals.

There are many classes of polynomials which are related to the Chebyshev
polynomials, such as [5, 9, 14, 15, 24]. In the spirit of some of these works - if
Ln(x), Tn(x), Un(x) denote (respectively) the nth Lucas-Lehmer polynomials,
the Chebyshev polynomials of the ﬁrst and second kind - we can consider the
polynomials Ln as a generalization of the so-called modiﬁed or shifted Chebyshev
polynomials, by introducing an appropriate change of variable t = f (x).

We will now outline the content of this paper.

In Sections 2 and 3 we
introduce the Lucas-Lehmer polynomials and we show their main properties.
Furthermore, we give a recursive formula for the sequence of the ﬁrst nonnegative
zeros of Ln(x), in terms of nested radicals. In Section 4 we show some relations
among the Lucas - Lehmer polynomials Ln(x) and the Chebyshev polynomials
of the ﬁrst and second kind, determining several new properties for the former.
In Section 5 we show some generalizations of the Lucas-Lehmer map, having
the same properties of Ln. In Section 6 we list some further perspectives and
developments of the theory.

2. First iterations of the Lucas-Lehmer map.

Let us consider the iterative map

Assuming L0 = x as the initial value, let us construct the ﬁrst terms of the
sequence. The function L1(x) = x2 − 2 represents a parabola with two ze-

3. Zeros and critical points.

Taking into account the considerations of the previous section, we can in
general state the following proposition (whose proof is quite simple and is omitted
for brevity)
Proposition 1. At each iteration the zeros of the map Ln(n ≥ 1) have the form

We show now what we argued in the previous steps.

Theorem 2. For n ≥ 2 we have
(3)

Ln(x) = 2 cos(2n−1x) + o(x3)

Proof. Taking into consideration the McLaurin expansion of the cosine, to prove
formula (3) is equivalent to show that

(4)

Ln(x) = 2 − 22n−2x2 + o(x3) = 2 − 4n−1x2 + o(x3) .

Let us proceed by means of induction principle. For n = 2 we have L2(x) =
(x2 − 2)2 − 2 =x4 − 4x2 + 2 = 2 − 4x2 + o(x3). Consider then the McLaurin
3 x4 − 4x2 + 2, which proves
polynomial of the second order of 2 cos(2x): it is 4
the relation for n = 2. Suppose now as true formula (3) for a generic index n
and proceed to check the case n + 1:

(5)

n − 2 = [2 − 4n−1x2 + o(x3)]2 − 2 =

Ln+1 = L2
= 2 − 4nx2 + o(x2)

THE CLASS OF LUCAS-LEHMER POLYNOMIALS.

It is also known that McLaurin polynomial of 2 cos(2nx) is 2− 22n · x2 + R3. We
can therefore conclude that 2 cos(2n−1x) and Ln(x) have the same coeﬃcients
(cid:3)
up to the second order, which concludes the proof.

We are interested in determining the distribution of minima and maxima
for each Ln. To this aim, now we are going to show an important property of
the polynomials Ln.

Let Mn be the set of the critical points and be Zn the set of the zeros of

Zn−1. To prove the second equality, it is suﬃcient to observe that the right hand
side of (6) vanishes either if x = 0 or if Li(x) = 0 for some i = 1, ..., n − 1; thus

Proposition 5. For each n ∈ N we have card(Mn) = 2n − 1. Furthermore, let
M +
n ) =
2n−1 − 1.
Proof. We must show that card(Mn) = 2n − 1; proceeding by induction:
if
n = 1, then L1(x) = x2 − 2 is a parabola having only a minimum, at the point
(0,−2). Now we are going to check it for n + 1, having assumed it true for a
generic n ≥ 2. From proposition 4, we have, for n > 1:

(12)

Mn+1 = Mn ∪ Zn ⇒ card(Mn+1) = card(Mn) + card(Zn)

(the intersection between Mn and Zn being empty). From proposition 4, we have
that card(Zn) = 2n; besides, by hypothesis, we know that card(Mn) = 2n − 1.
Then card(Mn+1) = 2n − 1 + 2n = 2n+1 − 1. Furthermore, if we don’t consider
the maximum in the origin, we will have 2n − 2 critical points, half of which are
(cid:3)
positive. Therefore card(M +

Proposition 3 is very useful because allows us to obtain some interesting
properties for the critical points of Ln(x). We already observed that, for ev-
mum. Moreover, for every natural number j such that 1 < j < n − 1 we have
that the points x0 such that Lj(x0) = 0 are maximum points for Ln. Indeed
− 2 = 2. Instead, the points x such that Ln−1(x) = 0, being
−2 = −2, are minimum points for Ln. Now, from proposition

(3) there aren’t other critical points; thus we have shown that the set of maxi-
Zi ∪ {x = 0}, while the set of minimum points of

mum points of Ln(x) is:

Ln(x) is Zn−1.

i=1

Remark 6. Minimum points for Ln(x) become maximum points for Ln+1(x),
maximum points for Ln(x) remain maximum points for Ln+1(x). This implies
that all the local maxima of every Ln are equal to 2.
Corollary 7. All zeros and critical points of Ln belong to the interval (−2, 2) .

Because of the symmetry of Lucas-Lehmer polynomials, we will study only positive zeros.

4. Relationships between Lucas-Lehmer polynomials and
Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kind, and

additional properties.

As we know [22, 2, 12], the Chebyshev polynomials of the ﬁrst kind satisfy

the recurrence relation(cid:40)

Tn(x) = 2xTn−1(x) − Tn−2(x)
T0(x) = 1, T1(x) = x

Corollary 10. Let x = 2 cos θ, then the polynomials Ln(x) admit the represen-
tation

(21)
Proof. Note that, in this case, |x| ≤ 2. Therefore we need to work with radicals
of negative numbers. Substituting x = 2 cos θ in (15) we have:

Ln(2 cos θ) = 2 cos (2nθ)

Ln(2 cos θ) = (cos 2θ − ı sin 2θ)2n−1

+ (cos 2θ + ı sin 2θ)2n−1

which can be rewritten by applying Euler’s identity:

(cid:0)e−ı2θ(cid:1)2n−1

+(cid:0)e+ı2θ(cid:1)2n−1

= 2 cos (2nθ)

(cid:3)
We resume approximation (3) of Ln(x) to prove that locally and for |x0| ≤ 2
the function Ln(x) behaves like a cosine, while globally, in [−2, 2], it oscillates
with shorter and shorter periods in the neighborhoods of the endpoints, by means
of the following theorem.

THE CLASS OF LUCAS-LEHMER POLYNOMIALS.

Ln(x) = 2 cos(2n−1k(x − x0)) + o((x − x0)2)

Theorem 11. Let x0 a generic maximum point of Ln(x). For n ≥ 2 we have
(22)
where k is such that |k| ≥ 1 and is increasing with x0, for ﬁxed n.
Proof. For n = 2 it is suﬃcient recall Theorem 2. In this case k = 1. Let us
now suppose the claim to be true for some natural n and proceed by induction
for n + 1:

Ln+1(x) =L2

n(x) − 2 = [2 cos(2n−1k(x − x0)) + o((x − x0)2)]2 − 2 =
= 4 cos2[2n−1k(x − x0)] + o[(x − x0)4]+
+ 4 cos[2n−1k(x − x0)] o[(x − x0)2] − 2

(23)

from which, by means of well known trigonometric formulas, we arrive to Ln+1(x) =
n − 2 = 2 cos(2nk(x − x0)) + o((x − x0)2) if x → x0. From Remark (6), the
L2
point x0 is a maximum point for Ln(x) and Ln+1(x). Now we aim to prove
that |k| ≥ 1. The second-order Taylor expansion of the right hand side of (22),
centered in x0, is

(24)

2 − 22(n−1)k2(x − x0)2 + o((x − x0)2)

For what concerns the left hand side of (22), we observe that Ln(x0) = 2, being
x0 a maximum point. Let us observe that equation (15)

6. Conclusions and perspectives.

In this paper we introduced a class of polynomials which follow the same
recursive formula as the Lucas-Lehmer numbers. We showed several properties
of the polynomials, including important links with the Chebyshev polynomials,
proving their orthogonality with respect to a suitable weight.

This paper intended just to introduce this new class of polynomials. Much
more aspects need to be deepened, concerning the properties of the polynomials
and their applications.

A further progress in our work will consist in studying the distribution of
the zeros of Ln. This topic is the subject of a paper in preparation. By Section 4,
the zeros, expressed in terms of nested radicals, allow us to generalize in inﬁnite
ways a well-known formula for the approximation of π. This formula allows
us to obtain several other notable mathematical constants as limits of suitably
weighted sequences of zeros of the Lucas-Lehmer polynomials Ln and M a
n.

18

PIERLUIGI VELLUCCI, ALBERTO MARIA BERSANI

Thanks to their strict link with the Chebyshev polynomials, we could de-
termine other properties of the Lucas-Lehmer polynomials, mainly of integral
and asymptotic type. These topics will be subject of future studies. Moreover,
it would be interesting to determine and study diﬀerent classes of Lucas-Lehmer
polynomials, for example modifying suitably the ﬁrst term of the sequence.

Finally, it is well known that Chebyshev polynomials can be applied in
several ﬁelds of Mathematics, for example in Numerical Analysis and Combina-
torics (see, for instance: [3, 5, 7, 13, 19, 23, 26, 4] and references therein). We
think that also the Lucas-Lehmer polynomials could be adapted to solve similar
problems.
