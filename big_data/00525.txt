Abstract

Let π be an automorphism of the Turing degrees induces by a home-
omorphism ϕ of the Cantor space 2ω such that ϕ preserves all Bernoulli
measures. It is proved that π must be trivial. In particular, a permutation
of ω can only induce the trivial automorphism of the Turing degrees.

Introduction

Let DT denote the set of Turing degrees and let ≤ denote its ordering. This
article gives a partial answer to the following famous question.

Question 1. Does there exist a nontrivial automorphism of DT?

Deﬁnition 1. A bijection π : DT → DT is an automorphism of DT if for all
x, y ∈ DT, x ≤ y iﬀ π(x) ≤ π(y). If moreover there exists an x with π(x) 6= x
then π is nontrivial.

Question 1 has a long history. Already in 1977, Jockusch and Solovay [3]
showed that each jump-preserving automorphism of the Turing degrees is the
identity above 0(4). Nerode and Shore 1980 [8] showed that each automorphism
(not necessarily jump-preserving) is equal to the identity on some cone. Slaman
and Woodin [11] showed that each automorphism is equal to the identity on the
cone above 0′′.

Haught and Slaman [2] used permutations of the integers to obtain auto-
morphisms of the polynomial-time Turing degrees in an ideal (below a ﬁxed
set).

Theorem 2 (Haught and Slaman [2]). There is a permutation of 2<ω, or equiv-
alently of ω, that induces a nontrivial automorphism of

for some A.

(PTIMEA, ≤pT).

Our result can be seen as a contrast to the following work of Kent.

Deﬁnition 3. A ⊂ ω is cohesive if for each recursively enumerable set We,
either A ∩ We is ﬁnite or A ∩ (ω \ We) is ﬁnite.

Theorem 4 (Kent [9, Theorem 12.3.IX], [4, 5]). There exists a permutation f
such that

(i) for all recursively enumerable B, f (B) and f −1(B) are recursively enu-
merable (and hence for all recursive A, f (A) and f −1(A) are recursive);

(ii) f is not recursive.

Proof. Kent’s permutation is just any permutation of a cohesive set (and the
identity oﬀ the cohesive set).

2 Universal algebra setup

Deﬁnition 5. The pullback of f : ω → ω is f ∗ : ωω → ωω given by

f ∗(A)(n) = A(f (n)).

2

We often write F = f ∗. Given a set S ⊆ ω let DS = Sω/ ≡T. Thus the elements
of DS are of the form

[g]S = { h ∈ Sω | h ≡T g },

g ∈ Sω.

Given F : Sω → Sω, let FS : DS → DS be deﬁned by

FS([A]S) = [F (A)]S.

If F = f ∗

S then we say that FS and F are both induced by f .

Lemma 6. For each f : ω → ω and each S ⊆ ω, the pullback f ∗ maps Sω into
Sω.

Proof.

A ∈ Sω, n ∈ ω =⇒ f ∗(A)(n) = A(f (n)) ∈ S.

In light of Lemma 6, we can deﬁne:

Deﬁnition 7. f ∗

S : DS → DS is the map given by

f ∗
S([g]S) = [f ∗(g)]S.

For S ⊆ ω (with particular attention to S ∈ {2, ω}), let

DS = Sω/ ≡T .

Our main result concerns D2; the corresponding result for Dω is much easier:

Theorem 8. Let f : ω → ω be a bijection and let f ∗ be its pullback. If f ∗
S is an
automorphism of DS for some inﬁnite computable set S, then f is computable.

Proof. Let η : ω → S be a computable bijection between ω and S. Then for all
x ∈ ω,

f ∗(η ◦ f −1)(x) = (η ◦ f −1)(f (x)) = η(f −1(f (x))) = η(x).

Since η ∈ Sω is computable and f ∗
computable. Hence f is computable.

S is an automorphism, η ◦ f −1 ∈ Sω must be

3 Permutations preserve randomness

Theorem 9. If B is f -µp-random, F = f ∗ and A = F (B) or A = F −1(B),
then A is f -µp-random.

Proof. First note that f −1-µp-randomness is the same as f -µp-randomness since
f ≡T f −1. Thus the result for A = F −1(B) follows from the result for A =
F (B). So suppose A = F (B) and A is not f -µp-random. So A ∈ ∩nUn where
{Un}n is an f -µp-ML test. Then

B ∈ {X | F (X) ∈ ∩nUn} = ∩nVn

3

where

Vn = {X | F (X) ∈ Un} = F −1(Un)

We claim that Vn is Σ0
Un = ∪k[σk] where the strings σk are all incomparable. Then

1(f ) (uniformly in n) and µp(Vn) = µp(Un). Write

and

Vn = ∪kF −1([σk])

µp[σk] = µpF −1([σk])

and the F −1([σk]), k ∈ ω are still disjoint and clopen. (If we think of σ ∈ 2<ω
as a partial function from ω to 2 then

F −1([σ]) = {X | F (X) ∈ [σ]}

= {X | X(f (n)) = σ(n), n < |σ|} = [{hf (n), σ(n)i | n < |σ|}].)

Thus {Vn}n is another f -µp-ML test, and so B is not f -µp-random, which
completes the proof.

Theorem 10. µp({A : A ≥T p}) = 1, in fact if A is µp-ML-random then A
computes p.

Proof. Kjos-Hanssen [6] showed that each Hippocratic µp-random set computes
p. In particular, each µp-random set computes p.

4 Cones have small measure

Deﬁnition 11 (Bernoulli measures). For each n ∈ ω,

µp({X ∈ 2ω : X(n) = 1}) = p

and X(0), X(1), X(2), . . . are mutually independent random variables.

Deﬁnition 12. An ultrametric space is a metric space with metric d satisfying
the strong triangle inequality

d(x, y) ≤ max{d(x, z), d(z, y)}.

Deﬁnition 13. A Polish space is a separable completely metrizable topological
space.

Deﬁnition 14. In a metric space, B(x, ε) = {y : d(x, y) < ε}.

Theorem 15 ([7, Proposition 2.10]). Suppose that X is a Polish ultrametric
space, µ is a probability measure on X, and A ⊆ X is Borel. Then

A measurable set A has density d at X if

for µ-almost every x ∈ A.

If A is measurable then so is Ξ(A). Furthermore, the measure of the sym-

metric diﬀerence of A and Ξ(A) is zero, so µ(Ξ(A)) = µ(A).

Sacks [10] and de Leeuw, Moore, Shannon, and Shapiro [1] showed that each
cone in the Turing degrees has measure zero. Here we use Theorem 17 to extend
this to µp.

e = A}) > 0 then A is c.e. in p.

Proof. Suppose µp({X : W X
e = A} has
positive measure, so Ξ(S) has positive measure, and hence by Theorem 15 there
is an X such that S has density 1 at X. Thus, there is an n such that µp(S |

“vote” among the sets extending σ. More precisely, n ∈ A iﬀ

and the set of n for which this holds is clearly c.e. in p.

Theorem 19. Each cone strictly above p has µp-measure zero:

µp({A : A ≥T q}) = 1

=⇒

q ≤T p.

Proof. If A can compute q then A can enumerate both q and the complement of
q. Hence by Theorem 18, q is both c.e. in p and co-c.e. in p; hence q ≤T p.

5 Main result

We are now ready to prove our main result Theorem 20 that no nontrivial
automorphism of the Turing degrees is induced by a permutation of ω.

Theorem 20. If π is an automorphism of D2 which is induced by a permutation
of ω then π(p) = p for each p ∈ DT.

Proof. Fix a permutation f : ω → ω and let F = f ∗ ↾ 2ω. Let B be f -µp-
random. We claim that B computes F (p).

By Theorem 10, for any f -µp random A, we have p ≤T A, hence F (p) ≤T

F (A). So it suﬃces to represent B as F (A).

Now B = F (F −1(B)). Let A = F −1(B). By Theorem 9, A is f -µp-random.

Thus every f -µp-random computes F (p).

Thus we have completed the proof of our claim that µp-almost every real

computes F (p).

By Theorem 19 it follows that F (p) ≤T p.
By considering the inverse f −1 we also obtain F −1(p) ≤T p and hence p ≤T

F (p). So F (p) ≡T p and F induces the identity automorphism.

6 Computing the permutation

Theorem 21. Let f : ω → ω be a permutation. Let F = f ∗ be its pullback
(Deﬁnition 5) to 2ω. If for positive Lebesgue measure many G, F (G) ≤T G,
then f is recursive.

Proof. By the Lebesgue Density Theorem we can get a Φ and a σ such that, if
µσ denotes conditional probability on σ and E = {A : F (A) = ΦA}, then

µσ(E) ≥ 95%.

For simplicity let us write pn(A) = A+n = A∪{n} and mn(A) = A−n = A\{n}.
Then p−1

n E = {A : pn(A) ∈ E}. Note that

E ⊆ p−1

n (E) ∪ m−1

n (E)

and

Then

Ec ⊆ p−1

n (Ec) ∪ m−1

n (Ec)

µσ(E) ≤ µσ(p−1

n (E) ∪ m−1

n (E)) ≤ µσ(p−1

n (E)) + µσ(m−1

n (E))

We now have

and

µσ{A : F (A + n) = ΦA+n} ≥ 90%

µσ{A : F (A − n) = ΦA−n} ≥ 90%;

Indeed, the events m−1
so for n > |σ|,

n (A), p−1

n (A) are each independent of the event n ∈ A,

95% ≤ µσ(E) = µσ(p−1

n (E) | n ∈ A)µσ(n ∈ A) + µσ(p−1

n (E)) + µσ(m−1

n (E)) ≤ 1 + min{µσ(p−1

n (E)), µσ(m−1

n (E))}.

Also F (A − n) and F (A + n) diﬀer in exactly one bit, namely f −1(n), for

all A:

F (A − n)(b) 6= F (A + n)(b) ⇐⇒ (A − n)(f (b)) 6= (A + n)(f (b))

⇐⇒ n = f (b) ⇐⇒ b = f −1(n),

that is

{A : (∀b)(F (A + n)(b) 6= F (A − n)(b) ↔ b = f −1(n))} = 2ω.

Let Dn,b = {A : ΦA+n(b) ↓6= ΦA−n(b) ↓}. For n > |σ|,

µσ


Dn,f −1(n) \ [

b6=f −1(n)

Dn,b


 = µσ{A : (∀b)(A ∈ Dn,b ↔ b = f −1(n))} ≥ 80%

since

µσ{A : ¬(∀b)(A ∈ Dn,b ↔ b = f −1(n))}

≤ µσ(¬p−1

n (E)) + µσ(¬m−1

n (E)) ≤ 10% + 10% = 20%.

Therefore, given any n, we can compute f −1(n): enumerate computations

until we have found some bit b such that

µσDn,b ≥ 80%.

Then b = f −1(n).

Thus f −1 is computable and hence so is f .

Theorem 22. If π is an automorphism of DT which is induced by a permutation
f of ω then f is recursive.

Proof. By Theorem 20, f ∗(G) ≡T G for each G ∈ 2ω. By Theorem 21, f is
recursive.

7 Measure-preserving homeomorphisms of the

Cantor set

Proposition 23. A permutation of ω induces a homeomorphism of 2ω that is
µp-preserving for each p.

Proposition 24. There exist homeomorphisms of 2ω that are µp-preserving for
each p, but are not induced by a permutation.

Proof. Map

[1] 7→ [111] ∪ [001] ∪ [101] ∪ [110]

(more generally, any collection of cylinders of strings of length 3 including 2
strings of Hamming weight 2 and 1 of Hamming weight 1).

Another way to express this is that the homeomorphism preserves the frac-

tion of 1s in a certain sense.

More precisely,

100 7→ 001,
101 7→ 101,

110 7→ 110,
111 7→ 111.

Theorem 25. Suppose ϕ is a homeomorphism of 2ω which is µp-preserving for
all p (it suﬃces to require this for inﬁnitely many p, or for a single transcen-
dental p). Suppose ϕ induces an automorphism π of the Turing degrees. Then
π = id.

We omit the proof which follows along the same lines as before.
