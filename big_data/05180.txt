Linear embedding of free energy minimization

Center for Computing Research, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87185, USA

Jonathan E. Moussa∗

Exact free energy minimization is a convex optimization problem that is usually approximated with stochastic
sampling methods. Deterministic approximations have been less successful because many desirable properties
have been diﬃcult to attain. Such properties include the preservation of convexity, lower bounds on free energy,
and applicability to systems without subsystem structure. We satisfy all of these properties by embedding free
energy minimization into a linear program over energy-resolved expectation values. Numerical results on small
systems are encouraging, but a lack of size consistency necessitates further development for large systems.

PACS numbers: 05.10.-a

Deterministic approximations of free energy minimization
trace back to the early work of Bethe [1]. His approach was
later generalized into the cluster variation method (CVM) [2]
and has served as the foundation for a broad class of modern
statistical inference methods [3]. Such deterministic methods
have not been as successful as stochastic methods such as the
Metropolis algorithm [4] because of a few persistent technical
problems. Relaxation of the convex free energy minimization
problem should produce a lower bound on free energy that is
the unique global minimum of a simpler convex optimization
problem. Only recently have methods begun to achieve this
goal by restricting statistical correlations to tree [5] or causal
[6] structures. A more persistent problem is that systems must
be decomposable into subsystems with a moderate number of
microstates. This is a problem for rotors in classical systems
or bosons in quantum systems where all subsystems have an
inﬁnite number of microstates without artiﬁcial truncations.

At zero temperature, the minimization of free energy over
microstate probability distributions reduces to a search for a
microstate with the lowest energy. If there is a large number
of microstates, then this is still a hard optimization problem.
However, relaxation methods in discrete optimization such as
the cutting-plane method [7] can reduce hard optimizations to
computationally tractable convex optimizations. The relaxed
problems optimize over supersets of the original domain and
produce lower bounds on minima. While there are no known
universal methods for relaxing all hard problems, a variety of
problem-speciﬁc relaxation methods exist [8].

In this paper, we study a convex relaxation of free energy
minimization to linear programs. The primary diﬃculty with
applying existing relaxation techniques to this problem is the
nonlinearity of entropy on microstate probabilities. All known
relaxations depend on linear information inequalities [9] and
a decomposition of systems into small subsystems. We derive
an alternate approach that embeds each expectation value in a
distribution of contributions over microstate energy. This is a
generalization of the energy density of states sampled by the
Wang-Landau algorithm [10]. The embedding linearizes the
free energy, which enables a cutting-plane relaxation.

Our goal is to compute the minimum free energy F(T) at a

temperature T of a system with N microstates,

N(cid:88)
N(cid:88)

F(T) = min
pi

(Ei pi + T pi ln pi)

subject to

pi = 1 and pi ≥ 0.

(1)

Microstate i has energy Ei and probability pi. T is in units
of energy. The minimizer pi(T) of Eq. (1) is the Boltzmann
distribution with partition function Z(T),

pi(T) =

exp(−Ei/T)

Z(T)

, Z(T) =

exp(−Ei/T).

(2)

N(cid:88)

i=1

F(T) is not eﬃcient to compute directly when N is large.

We assume a generic form of structure in Eq. (1) that does
not make reference to subsystems. The assumption is that a
system can be described by the expectation values of a small
number of observables, n (cid:28) N. We can then reduce pi to n
expectation values xi and Ei to n coeﬃcients hi as

N(cid:88)

n(cid:88)

xi =

Bi, j p j and

hiBi, j = E j

(3)

j=1

i=1

where observables are deﬁned by a matrix Bi, j with linearly
independent columns and B1,i = 1. A standard example is a
description of spin systems by few-spin expectation values.
To simplify Eq. (1), we must enforce pi ≥ 0 with only xi.
The feasible set of xi values is hard to compute. Instead, we
relax the N constraints on pi to m (cid:28) N constraints on xi as

n(cid:88)

Ai, jB j,k ≥ 0 ⇒ n(cid:88)

pi ≥ 0 and

Ai, jx j ≥ 0,

(4)

j=1

j=1

for an m-by-n matrix Ai, j that identiﬁes linear combinations of
observables with guaranteed nonnegative expectation values.
Eq. (4) is the central approximation of our F(T) lower bound
construction. A standard example is nonnegativity of marginal
probabilities for few-spin subsystems of a spin system.

In the T = 0 limit, F(T) reduces to ﬁnding the microstate
i that has the lowest energy Ei. This is a linear program in N
dimensions with variables pi. We relax Eq. (1) with Eq. (4)
to a linear program in n dimensions with variables xi,

F(0) ≥ min

Ai, jx j ≥ 0.

(5)

In this context, Eq. (4) is a form of the cutting-plane method
[7] in discrete optimization that simpliﬁes the feasible set.

For T > 0, the convex relaxation of F(T) in Eq. (1) is more
diﬃcult because of the nonlinearity of free energy in pi, which
is hard to approximate with xi. Inspired by the Wang-Landau
algorithm [10], we decompose pi into an integral over energy
density of states. We write this using normalized distributions
Pi(s) over the surprisal, s = ln Z(T) + E/T, such that
Pi(s) e−sds = pi.

This is a straightforward linear embedding of Eq. (1). Every
normalized nonnegative distribution collapses and results in a
Dirac delta function, Pi(s) = δ(s − ln Z(T) − Ei/T).

The T = 0 relaxation method can now be applied at T > 0.

First, we relax the distributional nonnegativity of Pi(s),

Pi(s) ≥ 0 ⇒ n(cid:88)

The relaxed ﬁnite linear program with nr variables xi, j is

This naturally reduces to Eq. (5) at T = 0. The cost of T > 0
is an increase in the number of variables from n to nr.
For the example considered in this paper, we construct test
functions as piecewise linear combinations of 1, e−s, and se−s
speciﬁcally for odd r. They are deﬁned by a set of (r + 1)/2
interpolation points si and split into two types of functions,

(14)
This interpolation is exact for 1, e−s, and se−s, and it deﬁnes
the coeﬃcients in Eq. (11). We use uniform grids of si values
that cover the range of possible s values in each calculation.

To demonstrate the dimensional reduction capability of our
linear embedding of free energy minimization, we consider a
clock with N microstates labeled by an angle θi = 2π(i−1)/N.
Convenient observables of the clock are n moments,

and

The number of optimization variables has been reduced from
N to n distributions. This bound is equivalent to Eq. (5) in the
T = 0 limit. Further relaxation requires discretization.

To constraint their expectation values, we must identify linear
combinations of moments that are nonnegative for every θi. A
clock with moment observables and constraints is an example
of non-subsystem structure described by Eqs. (3) and (4).

We consider a simple clock Hamiltonian with two nonzero
terms, h2 = − sin φ and h3 = − cos φ. For ample dimensional
reduction opportunities, we consider N = 220. We solve all of
the linear programs with ecos [11]. Eq. (5) is implemented as
shown, but Eq. (12) is rescaled to improve numerical stability
[12]. We use v jxi, j as variables instead of xi, j, and equations
with gi = Nδ1,i are rescaled by vr. This avoids large quantities
in the program and its solution, but persistent solver stability
problems still limit our numerical experiments.

At T = 0, it is possible to achieve a tight bound with Eq. (5)
using only observables that appear in the Hamiltonian with a
suﬃcient set of constraints. For our example with x1, x2, and
x3, these are N constraints deﬁned by

Ai,1 = 1, Ai,2 = − sin θi, and Ai,3 = − cos θi.

(16)
With N (cid:29) m, we approximate these constraints by uniformly
sampling m points from θi. Error versus m is shown in Fig. 1
with the Hamiltonian tuned to φ = π/m to maximize the error.
There is an m−2 scaling of error, which is comparable to the
error in estimating the minimum of a smooth function from its
evaluation at a uniform set of points without interpolation.

AT T > 0, we set s1 and sr to be the exact minimum and
maximum surprisal values and achieve apparent convergence
with r = 41. With 3 observables, the error saturates in Fig. 1.
We extend these calculations to 5 and 7 observables with the
addition of constraints deﬁned by nonnegative functions of θi,

q(cid:89)
[1 − cos(θi − θΛ( j))] ≥ 0,

(17)

j=1

deﬁned by q angles, θΛ( j), for q ≤ (n − 1)/2. We again limit
the number of constraints by uniformly sampling these angles
from θi. A systematic reduction of error with increasing n is
evident in Fig. 1 at T > 0. Unlike T = 0, we need to consider
observables that do not appear in the Hamiltonian to improve
the accuracy at T > 0. The cause of these diﬀerences between
T = 0 and T > 0 is unknown and left for future studies.

FIG. 1.
(color online) Relaxed energy minimization (left) and free
energy minimization (right) for a clock with N = 220 and microstate
energies E(θ) = − cos(θ − φ). Its exact energies are F(0) = −1 and
F(0.5) ≈ −7.343. At T = 0, the error converges with only n = 3
observables, and extra observables simply reduce the approximation
eﬃciency. At T = 0.5, the error stagnates with n = 3 observables,
and extra observables reduce the minimum attainable error.

For a many-body method to be accurate for large systems,
size-consistency errors must be small [13]. These errors occur
when separate and combined calculations of two independent
subsystems disagree. We combine Eq. (9) for two subsystems
‘L’ and ‘R’ by merging the linear programs in a block matrix
notation to partition observables (‘1’ separated from ‘> 1’),

By construction, the combined solution is feasible and gives
a free energy bound equal to the sum of the subsystem free
energy bounds. However, it is not necessarily a stable solution
to Eq. (9) and any further reductions of the free energy bound
after reoptimization constitute a size-consistency error.

We study the size-consistency errors of a linear embedding
for independent spins in a uniform ﬁeld. We model each spin
exactly with two observables and two constraints,

complementary to conventional cluster-based methods such as
CVM [2]. By construction, cluster expansions of entropy have
no size-consistency errors. However, they are based on exact
entropy calculations of small subsystems, which assumes the
eﬃcient summation over subsystem microstates. For systems
composed of subsystems with a large or even inﬁnite number
of microstates, brute force cluster expansions are intractable.
Examples include clocks with large N and continuous rotors
in the N → ∞ limit of a clock. It may be possible to combine
linear embedding techniques that reduce the size and cost of
subsystem calculations with cluster expansions that maintain
overall size consistency. The further development of eﬃcient
but non-size-consistent subsystem methods will complement
orthogonal development of cluster-based methods such as the
identiﬁcation of new information inequalities [9].

For linear embedding to develop into a general-purpose free
energy minimization method, size-consistency errors must be
eliminated. The simplest possibility would be to identify new
constraints that guarantee the stability of combined solutions
in Eq. (18). In addition to the structure postulated in Eqs. (3)
and (4), we might attempt to impose predetermined subsystem
structure. When combining calculations of two systems, their
subsystem structure must also be merged. Another plausible
size-consistent extension of linear embedding is to extend the
s parameter used in Eq. (6) into a separate si parameter for
each microstate that extends the temperature dependence into
a full characterization of the thermodynamic state space [14].
This simpliﬁes the combination of independent subsystems in
Eq. (18) from a convolution to a product. However, it creates
a high-dimensional space of variables that must be reduced to
coincide with the small number of important observables. A
Fisher information matrix can be deﬁned on this space, and its
spectral nonnegativity might be a useful constraint. The large
number of variables introduced by this extension would need
to be compensated for by a large number of constraints.

Linear embedding of free energy minimization preserves its
convexity but changes its basic structure. The exact problem
has a linear objective function only at zero temperature, while
the approximate problem always has a linear objective. These
linear problems are optimized on a boundary of their feasible
set. At ﬁnite temperature, the pi ln pi entropy terms in Eq. (1)

4

drive solutions away from the boundary, which are deﬁned by
pi = 0 for one or more i. This fundamentally changes how the
problem responds to perturbations. Responses are determined
by derivatives of the objective in the nonlinear case and by the
shape of the boundary in the linear case. The consequences of
this diﬀerence are unclear. Any convenience gained from the
use of linear program solvers for free energy minimization is
possibly oﬀset by a fundamental distortion of the problem. It
is still possible for nonlinear embedding to retain the property
of having extrema only on the interior of the feasible set.

There are also computational complexity diﬀerences in free
energy minimization between zero and ﬁnite temperature. At
zero temperature, the search for the lowest-energy microstate
is NP-hard. In general, accurate approximation of a solution
is intractable on a classical computer in polynomial time [15].
At ﬁnite temperature, free energy approximation is equivalent
to approximation of #P-hard counting problems [16]. While
a complete understanding of the relative complexity between
zero and ﬁnite temperature is not yet known, it is possible to
approximate #P problems with access to an NP oracle [17].

Ultimately, this paper is meant to motivate and inspire new
ideas in deterministic methods for free energy minimization.
We have developed a linear embedding concept, computed a
numerical example, presented an analytically solvable model,
and identiﬁed the problem of size-consistency errors. While it
is of limited applicability in its present form, there are many
possible directions of future development. In particular, there
are multiple possible ways to combine linear embedding with
cluster-based methods to ﬁx size-consistency errors. Finally,
we note that linear embedding has a straightforward quantum
generalization as do many cluster-based methods [6]. We need
methods such as linear embedding to simulate the unbounded
Hilbert spaces of bosons without artiﬁcial truncations.
