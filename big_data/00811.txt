(Dated: March 3, 2016)

We report on a comprehensive theoretical study of the electronic structures of freestanding
nanowires made from narrow band gap semiconductors GaSb, InSb and InAs. The nanowires
are described by the eight-band k.p Hamiltonians and the band structures are computed by means
of the ﬁnite element method with a mixture basis consisting of linear triangular elements inside
the nanowires and constrained Hermite triangular elements on the boundaries. The nanowires
with two crystallographic orientations, namely [001]- and [111]-orientations, and diﬀerent shapes
of the cross sections are considered. For each orientation, the nanowires of the three narrow band
gap materials are found to show qualitatively similar band structure characteristics. However, the
nanowires oriented along the two diﬀerent orientations are found to show diﬀerent characteristics
in the valence bands. In particular, it is found that all the conductance bands show simple, good
parabolic dispersions in both the [001]- and [111]-oriented nanowires, while the top valence bands
show double-maximum structures in the [001]-oriented nanowires but camel-back like structures in
the [111]-oriented nanowires. The wave functions and spinor distributions of the band states in these
nanowires are also calculated and analyzed. It is found that signiﬁcant mixtures of electron and hole
states appear in the bands of these narrow band gap semiconductor nanowires. The wave functions
exhibit very diﬀerent distribution patterns in the nanowire oriented along the [001] direction and
the nanowires oriented along the [111] direction. It is also shown that simple single band eﬀective
mass theory could not be used to reproduce all the band state wave functions presented in this work.

INTRODUCTION

Recently semiconductor nanowires have attracted
great attention due to their unique physical proper-
ties and potential applications in nano-electronics, op-
toelectronics, and quantum electronics. With advances
in the materials technology, high-quality semiconduc-
tor nanowire have been synthesized through for instance
molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE)1–3, chemical vapor de-
position (CVD)4–6, and metal-organic vapor phase epi-
taxy (MOVPE)7–9 along diﬀerent crystallographic direc-
tions. Due to their well organized crystal arrangements,
relatively high carrier mobilities, small cross-sections,
and signiﬁcant quantum conﬁnement eﬀects, III-V semi-
conductor nanowires have been employed to construct
ﬁeld-eﬀect transistors10–13, infrared photodetectors14,15,
light emission diodes (LED)16,17,
thermal electrical
devices18,19, laser devices20,21, solar cells22–24, and quan-
tum electronic devices.

theoretical methods,
theory (DFT)25–28,

including density-
Several
functional
(TB)
tight-binding
methods29–35 and k.p theory36–45, have been used
to study the properties of semiconductor nanowires.
Among all the computational choices, k.p theory is
considered as the cheapest one and is wildly adopted to
calculate the nanowire band structures near the band
extrema. A great advantage of k.p theory is that it
can easily handle nanowires with cross-section sizes
larger than a hundred nanometers,
for which other
methods often encounter computational diﬃculty. In the
literature, both narrow and large band gap nanowires
grown along the [001] crystallographic direction have

been widely and systematically discussed based on
6 × 6 or 8 × 8 k.p Hamiltonians.41,42,45 However, the
properties of more frequently experimentally synthesized
[111]-oriented nanowires have less been studied with
k.p theory as compared to those oriented along the
[001] direction. Redi´nski and Peeters44 have calculated
the band structure of GaAs nanowires oriented in the
[111] direction based on a six-band Luttinger-Kohn
hamiltonian and have found a typical “camel-back”
structure in the hole dispersion which can result in a
double peak feature in the optical absorption spectra.
Lassen et al. have made a preliminary study of the
band structure of [111]-oriented GaAs nanowires based
on a 4 × 4 Burt-Foreman Hamiltonian43 and a study
of the band structures of [111]-oriented InP and InAs
nanowires based on 8 × 8 Hamiltonians36. In particular,
they have showed the cross-section size dependencies
of the band gaps and the valence band structures
of [111]-oriented InP and InAs nanowires with small
cross-section sizes of 2.5 nm and 15 nm. However, their
studies lack of the analysis of the conducting bands and
the spinor distributions in the band states which play
an essential role in the understanding of the electronic
properties of nanowires, especially, for those made from
narrow band gap semiconductors41.
In addition, the
capability of k.p theory should be fully exploited and
extended to nanowires with large cross section sizes,
which are seldom discussed theoretically, but are more
commonly synthesized and employed in experiments.

The purpose of this paper is to present a systematic
study of the electronic structures of narrow band gap
semiconductor GaSb, InSb and InAs nanowires oriented

2

along [001] and [111] crystallographic directions based
on 8 × 8 k.p theory. A form of an eight-band Luttinger-
Kohn Hamiltonian with a principal axis along the [111]
direction has been derived. Such a Hamiltonian has not
yet been present before, but it is required to study the
electronic structure of nanowires grown along the [111]
crystallographic direction. The paper is organized as
follows. In Section II, the eight-band theory applicable
to nanowires oriented in the [001] and [111] directions
and materials parameter choices are presented and dis-
cussed. The method of numerical computations has also
been brieﬂy described in this section, while its details
are presented and discussed in Appendix.
In Section
III, the results of calculations for [001]-oriented GaSb,
InSb and InAs nanowires based on the standard eight-
band Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian are presented and dis-
cussed. In Section IV, the results of calculations for [111]-
oriented GaSb, InSb and InAs nanowires based on the
derived form of the eight-band Luttinger-Kohn Hamilto-
nian as shown in Section II are presented and discussed,
and are compared with the corresponding [001]-oriented
nanowires. Finally, the paper is summarized in Section
V.

II. THEORY

In this section, we present the k.p theory employed for
this work. For the study of narrow band gap semiconduc-

tor nanowires, it becomes very important to adopt a the-
ory that includes the interaction between the conduction
bands and the valence bands.
In this work, an eight-
band Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian46 will be adopted.
For GaSb, InSb and InAs nanowires oriented in the
[001] crystallographic direction, the standard form of the
Hamiltonian can be employed directly after replacing the
kx and ky vectors with the corresponding momentum op-
erators. However, for the treatment of experimentally
more commonly grown, [111]-oriented GaSb, InSb and
InAs nanowires, one needs to transform the standard
form of the eight-band Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian to
the form with the [111] direction as a principal axis. In
the following, a derivation of an eight-band Luttinger-
Kohn Hamiltonian with the [111] direction as a principal
axis will be presented. The numerical implementation
and the choices of the parameters in the treatment of
GaSb, InSb and InAs nanowires will also be described
and discussed.

A. Derivation of an eight-band Hamiltonian with

an arbitrary principal axis orientation

Our starting point in deriving a form of the eight-band
Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian with the [111] direction as
a principal axis is the famous 4× 4 Kane matrix47 which
has been widely used in the study of direct band gap
semiconductors. The matrix is in the form of

to valence band structures, A(cid:48) and B come from the sec-
ond order interactions involving the states outside the

An eight-band k.p Hamiltonian with the [001] direc-
tion as a principal axis could be derived based on the

number J = 1/2 or 3/2 and the corresponding compo-
nent quantum number M , leaving a value of ∆/3 added
to the heavy-hole (HH) and the light-hole (LH) states
and a value of −2∆/3 added to the spin split-oﬀ (SO)
state. In practical applications, the basis set of {|JM(cid:105)}
is often chosen in the presentation of an eight-band k.p
Hamiltonian. In the treatment of nanowires oriented in
the [001] direction, the eight-band Kane Hamiltonian as
in Eq. (2) or its corresponding form represented in the
basis set of {|JM(cid:105)} needs to be solved after replacing kx
and ky with the corresponding momentum operators.

In the treatment of narrow band gap nanowires ori-
ented in a direction other than [001] direction, it is how-
ever convenient to adopt an eight-band k.p Hamilto-
nian described with a principal axis along the direction.
Such a Hamiltonian could be derived from the standard
eight-band Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian using a rotation
operator,36

with I4 is a 4×4 identity matrix. The Hamiltonian matrix
Hγ expressed in terms of the basis set {γ} is related to the
standard k.p Hamiltonian matrix Hα, which is expressed
in terms of the original basis set {α}, via

Hγ = W ∗HαW T .

(11)

In the Hamiltonian matrix given in Eq. (3), each ele-
ment is a polynomial of k vector components up to the
second power. Here k is deﬁned in the original coordi-
nate system.
In order to conveniently treat nanowires
oriented along an arbitrary direction deﬁned by azimuth
angle (θ, φ), we would like to deﬁne the k vector in the
Hamiltonian in the rotated system. In terms of this newly
deﬁned k
α is trans-
formed according to

vector, the original Hamiltonian H 0

(cid:48)

H 0

α(k

) = H 0

α(R−1k).

(12)

By combining Eqs. (11) and (12), the Hamiltonian H 0
deﬁned in terms of the basis set {γ} with a principal
axis along the direction set by azimuth angle (θ, φ) in
the rotated system can be found from

H 0

The result shown in Eq. (13) is a concise form with-
out including the spin-orbit interaction term H so in
Eq. (4). This term is of a diagonal form in the basis
of {δ}={|J(cid:48)M(cid:48)(cid:105)}. Here we use |J(cid:48)M(cid:48)(cid:105) to denote that the
state angular momenta are deﬁned with the respect to
the principal axes in the rotated coordinate systems. It
can be shown that the basis set {δ} is connected to the
basis set {γ} via

{δ} = Q{γ},

details about the FEM please refer to the Appendix. In
FEM the nanowire eigenvalue equation

HF = EF,

where H is the Hamiltonian and F is the envelop func-
tion, is discretized by a mixture basis consisting linear
triangular elements inside and constrained Hermite tri-
angular elements on the boundaries. The inclusion of
high-order constrained Hermite basis signiﬁcantly sup-
pressed the Gibbs-Vibration of the envelop function54,
as is shown by Part. III and Part. IV the cross-section
wave function distributions. The eigenvalue equation un-
der the FEM basis set is expressed as

the expansion coeﬃcients vector of the envelope function
F . The envelope function of a particular eigenstate could
be restored via a linear combination of the basis functions
and the expansion coeﬃcients.

The state component decomposition is a useful tool
in determining the corresponding ingredient in term of
|JM(cid:105) basis. In an eight-band k.p theory the state contri-
butions from electron (EL), heavy-hole (HH), light-hole
(LH) and split-oﬀ (SO) are of most interest, which are
individually described in real numbers of Cel, Chh, Clh
and Cso. The corresponding values of the four coeﬃcients
could be found via ﬁrst envelope function decomposition

ters used to calculated Ep are taken from Ref. 51, except

nanowires, we still face problems with spurious solutions
even after we have modiﬁed parameter Ep with using the
recommended value of mc in Eq. (20) by Vurgaftman et
al. in Ref. 51. Thus, in the treatment of InSb nanowires,
we have used the recommended value of mc as suggested
for bulk InSb in Ref. 53, which is still in the reasonable
range as suggested by Vurgaftman et al. Table I sum-
marizes all the required material parameters used in the
calculations for this work, except for parameters A(cid:48) and
B. These two parameters have been set to zero in the
calculations.

C. Numerical implementation

The Finite-Element-Method (FEM) is a numerical
technique to ﬁnd the approximate solutions of partial
diﬀerential equations. Here we will brieﬂy introduce the
FEM treatment of the nanowire Hamiltonian. For more

Ci = Fi · F,

i = el, hh, lh, so.

The normalized envelope function F guarantees the sum-
mation constraint of the four coeﬃcients, as shown by

Cel + Chh + Clh + Cso = 1.

III. BAND PROPERTIES OF [001]-ORIENTED

FREE-STANDING NANOWIRES

In the following we present our results of [001]-oriented
nanowires. Besides the normal band properties of each
material, we will also concentrate on several important
topics for [001] nanowires. The ﬁrst part is a compar-
ison between GaSb and InSb, Since it would be more
intriguing to put a normal band nanowire and a narrow
band nanowire together. Apart from their band struc-
ture, the wave function analysis and the spinor distribu-
tion analysis are both eﬀective tools to understand the
diﬀerences. The next part is InAs, which is also an im-
portant semiconductor material. The band properties
analysis together with a cross-section discussion in [001]
direction will be oﬀered.

Since the Rashbar or Derashhoose term is not included

in this k.p calculation, so the energy bands are always two
degenerated.
In the following calculation we will omit
this degeneracy for simplicity.

A. GaSb and InSb: A Comparison in [001]

Direction

In Figure 2 and Figure 3 we give our the band struc-
tures and the lowest conducting and highest valence band
spinor functions of [001] GaSb and InSb with square cross
sections of size 40 × 40nm2. The conducting and va-
lence band are measured in eV and meV respectively,
and the spinor functions are all normalized to one. Both
of the conducting band shows simple parabola shapes,
while the valence bands exhibit much more complicated
band distributions. Du to the square boundary con-
dition of the nanowire, the lowest conducting band is
non-degenerated(apart from the spin degree, which al-
ways exists in our computations), while the 2nd and
3rd lowest conducting bands are almost degenerate at
E ≈ 0.84eV for GaSb and E ≈ 0.3eV . The same phe-
nomena appears in the 5th and 6th, 8th and 9th lowest
conducting bands at approximately E = 0.865eV and
E = 0.88eV for GaSb, E = 0.34eV and E = 0.36eV for
InSb respectively. The near degenerated band structure
arises from the one conducting band model, within which
they are exactly degenerated. Since the existence of the
conducting-valence band interaction, those originally de-
generated bands lose their degeneracy and split into two
sub-bands. This could be further illustrated in Figure 5,
where the wave functions of GaSb under one band model
are presented.

The non-Γ highest point of the top valence band
of [001] GaSb and InSb shows the well knows ”camel
back” structure42,44,45. The camel back structure, which
thought to be originated from the heavy-hole and the
is further correlated to the size
light-hole interaction,
of the nanowire44 and the Kane energy therm Ep
42.
Evidence44 have shown that in [001] six-band GaAs for
nanowires with radius greater than 3.5A, the camel back
structure should be exist on the top most valence band,
which is in accord with our GaSb and InSb results.
However, due to the diﬀerence Ep magnitude and other
band parameters, an obviously diﬀerent curvature of the
”camel back” peak towards Γ exhibits and give rise two
an almost touching 1st and 2nd highest valence bands in
InSb at Γ point. In later part we will verify through wave-
function that the same band order still maintains for [001]
40nm InSb nanowire compared with GaSb. The highest
valence band itself shows a double-maximum structure,
which also appears in the six-band computation of [001]
GaAs44 and will result in one high peaks on the optical
absorption spectrum. The deeper valence band of the
two material looks similar as well. The 2nd highest va-
lence band(counted based on the order at Γ point) crosses
with the 3rd one at around kz = 0.005A−1, and the 3rd
band crosses with the 1st band at k = 0.015A−1 then

forms the double-maximum structure of the top valence
band. The 4th highest valence band both shows a valley
at kz = 0.01A−1, which forms an anti-crossing structure
with the 5th band. For more deeper ones, since they
are not dominant part determining the hole property of
nanowires, their slightly diﬀerent structure are not de-
tailed discussed here.

Let’s move on to the spinor distribution analysis of
GaSb and InSb for the same structures. Figure 2(b) and
Figure 3(b) give the lowest conducting band spinor dis-
tribution of [001] 40 × 40nm2 GaSb and InSb nanowires,
while the Figure 2(d) and Figure 3(d) oﬀer the highest
valence band spinor distributions of the two materials.
For the lowest conducting band, both of GaSb and InSb
shows electron component decreasing and hole increas-
ing patten along positive kz axis. This could be under-
stood by the electron-hole interacting terms T, V, W, U
in Hamiltonian (6). With W and T term set by zero,
the fundamental terms are U and V, both of which are
linear dependent with (cid:126)k. Thus the increasing k give rise
to the stronger entire electron-hole interaction and re-
sults in a larger mixing between conducting band and va-
lence band, resulting in the electron part decreasing as in
Fig 1(b) and Fig 2(b) with larger k. Nevertheless, Since
GaSb is believed to be a larger gap semiconductor com-
pared to InSb, there still exist several diﬀerence in the
lowest conducting band spinor functions. An apparent
feature is that the electron component of GaSb is close
to one and with nearly zero hole component at Γ point,
while InSb exhibit distinguishable less electron compo-
nent and larger light-hole(LH) component at that point.
This is an perfect evidence to help distinguish the narrow
gap semiconductor InSb with an ordinary semiconductor
GaSb. The highest valence band spinor functions, illus-
trated in Fig 1(d) and Fig 2(d), give us interesting re-
sults as well. First, we see that the largest component of
both materials experience an abruption at approximately
kz = 0.015A−1, switching from light-hole(LH) to heavy-
hole(HH). The abruption is easily understood by the 1st
and 3rd highest valence band intersect at kz = 0.015A−1.
Another feature is that the largest component is light
hole near the Γ point for top valence band, while with
larger k point HH dominates. This is due to the band
structure of bulk III-V material and the wave-function
shape of the LH and HH. It is known that in bulk ma-
terial at Γ point LH and HH are strictly degenerated,
and for k point away from Γ, the HH is always above LH
and their energy distance consistently increasing. For
large k point, since the position of HH is signiﬁcantly
greater than LH, so the top valence band shows greater
HH component. For small k point, the origin LH and
HH positions are much close. However, the Wave func-
tion of the HH is much extended than LH, as shown in
Figs. 4 and 5. Due to the quantum conﬁnement eﬀect,
the HH experience more energy shift than the LH. Near
the Γ point, the bulk energy diﬀerence of LH and HH are
rather small, so wave function conﬁnement eﬀect take
charge in the largest component of the top valence band

wave function of one band model GaSb for comparison
in Figure 5. The 2nd and 3rd wave function shown in
the picture are mainly concentrated on the diagonal di-
rection and not at all like the ones of a ringlike real GaSb
wave function. This demonstrates an eight-band treat-
ment necessity even in a normal gap semiconductor. The
wave function of the other 4th and 5th states both have
four peaks, which is in accord with the D4 symmetry of
the nanowire under the k.p treatment. As for the wave
function of the valence band, the Figure 4(f)-(j) shows
more condensed shape in general compared to the con-
ducting ones. The highest valence band, though is also
S-like, are mush localized than the 1st conducting S wave
function. The 2nd wave function is ring like as well, just
as the 2nd conducting band. The more deeper bands,

in small k region. These two factor, the bulk HH and
LH energy position in large k and the signiﬁcant conﬁne-
ment eﬀect in small k, together result in the feature of the
dominating LH in small k and HH in large k component
of the top valence band spinor distribution.
In the next part we will discuss the wave function
of [001] 40 × 40nm2 GaSb and InSb band edges at Γ
point. The wave-function probability distribution are
calculated via the product of corresponding envelope
function weighted by the basis normalization matrix M
in equation (30) in ﬁnite element method. We have list
the ﬁve lowest conducting band wave function of GaSb
at Γ point in Figure 4(a)-(e). It’s easy to see that the
lowest conducting band is S like, while the 2nd and 3rd
have a ringlike peak on the boundary and look similar.
In reality these two are the almost degenerated states in

behave as an sub-operation of the entire D4.

The wave function of InSb in Fig 4 is almost the same
as GaSb. We have mentioned in the last part that InSb
exhibits a larger curvature and a touching structure for
the 1st and 2nd highest valence bands. But from the
ﬁgure we ﬁnd that the wave function order of the 1st
and 2nd valence band InSb is just the same as GaSb.
No band crossing occurs for InSb if we take GaSb as
the benchmark under the diameter we studied. The S-
like wave function is on the top, while the P-like wave
function on the bottom.

B.

InAs: Band Properties and Cross-Section

Discussion in [001] Direction

The band properties of [001]-oriented InAs has been
discussed by Kishore et al.41.
In their computations
Bessel
functions have been chosen as the expanding
bases, with which only circle boundary condition could
be handled. Few works have explored the eﬀects of dif-
ferently chosen boundaries to the band structure and
wave functions. Though Lassen et al.36,43 have discussed
the [001] and [111] valence band structures under circle
and square, circle and hexagon cross-section respectively,
their analysis lacks the the discussion of more deeper va-
lence bands and the the conducting bands, which are es-
sentially of great importance as we have mentioned. We
think it is necessary to reexamine the inﬂuence of the
cross-section factor to the nanowire. By taking the ad-
vantage of ﬁnite-element-method, we could directly set
the boundary condition to any cross-section we want. In
this paper, we have construct square, circle cross-sections
for [001] nanowires and hexagon, circle cross-sections for
[111] nanowires. The circular boundary condition is an
twenty regular polygon in our FEM for both computa-
tional precise and convenience.
In the computation of
[001] InAs cross-section study, to avoid the conﬁnement
eﬀect as mush as possible and make the results more con-
vincing, we take the area of the circular nanowire equates
the square nanowire, i.e., nanowires with radius 22.57nm
for circle cross-section and side length of 40nm for square.
In Figure 7 we have plotted two band structures of
[001] InAs with circular cross-section (a)(c) with radius
R=22.57nm and square (b)(d) with side length L=40nm.
In general, the two energy bands are pretty much alike for
the conducting and valence band edges. For the conduct-
ing bands, both shapes have the non-degenerated lowest
conducting band and a pair of degenerated 2nd and 3rd
bands. But for the 4th conducting band in Fig 6(b),
which ought to be slightly beneath 0.48eV is neither non-
degenerated nor beneath 0.48eV. The same phenomenon
occurs for the 6th band in Figure 7(b), whose compan-
ion should be non-degenerated in Figure 7(a) but actu-
ally results in degenerated ones at around 0.49eV. For
higher conducting bands this kind of disagreement per-
sistently appears, which indicates that the one to one cor-

8

respondence is not always correct for the bands beyond
the 4th conducting band in [001] nanowires. For valence
bands, the top band edges are almost the same between
the two directions. Both of the top valence bands shows
“camel-back” and ”double-maximum” structure, and the
2nd highest valence band intersect with the 3rd one at
around k = 0.006A−1. The 4th band and 5th bands,
though are seems touching each other in the circular va-
lence band, still have the same band order compared to
the square one if we take a look at the corresponding va-
lence wave function order in Figure 8 and Figure 9. Those
deeper valence bands in circular shape, however, exhibit
totally diﬀerent structures as the ones in square shape.
So it’s essential to take careful consideration about the
cross-section of a nanowire before perform computation
if one are interested in the properties closely related to
the higher conducting bands or deeper valence bands.

Let us move on to the wave function comparison of the
square and circular nanowires. In Figure 8 and Figure 9
we have plotted the conducting band and valence band
wave functions at Γ point of [001] InAs nanowire with
square and circular cross section respectively. The en-
tire InAs nanowire band regardless of the cross-section
shape looks similar with those of GaSb and InSb in Fig-
ure 4 and Figure 6 except for the order of the highest
two valence states, where conversely the S-like state in
the valence band locate beneath the P-like top valence
state. This diﬀerence are consequences of diﬀerent mate-
rial parameters. If we compare the circular wave function
with the square ones, we should ﬁnd that the diﬀerence is
not that obvious as the top two valence band of InAs to
InSb and GaSb. One apparent thing is that the symme-
try of the entire nanowire promoted from D4 to D∞, so
the 2nd and 3rd conducting band of circular InAs shows
ring like peak when the square ones show four peaks on
the corner. For the hole structure the band order does
not change for both cross-sections. The symmetry alter-
nation is still found in the peak shape of the top valence
state. All in all, the wave function diﬀerences between
the two shapes nevertheless are not that pronounced in
the states we study.

Combine the analysis of band structure and wave func-
tion comparison together, we conclude that it is more
appropriate to chose an square boundary condition when
computing an [001] oriented nanowire if one are inter-
ested in more than the band edges of the nanowires.

IV. BAND PROPERTIES OF [111]-ORIENTED

FREE-STANDING NANOWIRES

The properties of [111] oriented nanowires are not
widely discussed as the [001] ones, but it is rather impor-
tant since the grown direction of the nanowire is mostly
[111] or even higher crystal index faces. When the di-
rection change from [001] to [111], the diﬀerent bound-
ary condition and eﬀective masses bring about diﬀerent
band structures and wave function shapes, as we will see

in the ﬁrst part of [111] GaSb nanowire. The next part
is the narrow gap material InSb. We will not only dis-
cuss its common and unique band properties compared
to GaSb, but also the inﬂuence of cross-section selection
choice between the usual circle boundary and the authen-
tic hexagon boundary we have adopt. The ﬁnal part is a

FIG. 11. [111] GaSb wave function distribution

series discussion of InAs, from which we study the band
and wave function evolution with size increasing. We ﬁnd
interesting wave function switching, which could be ex-
plained by the conﬁnement sensitivity for corresponding
valence state.

In our [111]-oriented nanowire computation, the cross-
section of the [111] nanowires are set to be hexagon by
default in our FEM calculation, which is measured by
the length of size edge H. Once again we omit the spin
degree since no spin splitting occurs here.

A. GaSb: Band Properties in [111] Direction and

Comparison to [001] Direction

In Figure 10 we have present the band structure and
spinor distribution of [111] oriented GaSb nanowire with
edge length H = 24.8nm, whose cross-section area is just
the same as the [001] GaSb nanowire in Figure 2 for com-
parison. From the Figure 10(a) we see that the conduct-
ing band of [111] GaSb have parabola patterns just as

kz(π/((cid:2)(3)a0))00.020.040.060.080.1E(eV)0.820.840.860.880.9kz(π/((cid:2)(3)a0))00.020.040.060.080.1E(meV)-8-6-4-20kz(π/((cid:2)(3)a0))00.020.040.060.080.1Probability00.20.40.60.81ELLHHHSOkz(π/((cid:2)(3)a0))00.020.040.060.080.1Probability00.20.40.60.81the [001] nanowires. The lowest conducting band, which
is located at around 0.82eV , is followed by the almost
degenerated 2nd and 3rd lowest conducting bands with
energies slightly below 0.84eV , just as the [001] GaSb.
The two nearly degenerated bands are again come from
the authentic degenerated bands of electron-hole decou-
pled one conducting band model with an hexagon cross-
section. Not at all like the ones of [001] GaSb, the 4th
and 5th bands slightly below 0.86eV are nearly degen-
erated. Deviation once more appears at the 6th band
laying above 0.86eV , who has a nearly degenerated ac-
companied band in the [001] nanowire. The 7th and 8th
bands, with a energy distance of about 4meV , are actu-
ally two separated bands not like the almost superposed
ones in [001]. Though in general, the conducting bands of
[111] GaSb have almost parabola dispersions, due to the
diﬀerent boundary condition and electron-hole interac-
tion the [111] energy bands have diﬀerent hierarchy and
groups compared to [001] GaSb nanowire. As for the va-
lence bands, an apparently new pattern has formed in
the [111] GaSb band structure with regard to [001] di-
rection. The highest valence band, though shows camel
back structure near Γ point, possesses the ”side-peak”
structure rather than the ”double-maximum” structure
on the two local maxima. This diﬀerent feature will result
in a two peak electron-absorption44 distanced by about 1
meV under our parameter set. The 2nd highest valence
band(count by the energy positions at the Γ point), like
the [001] ones in Figure 2(c), intersects with the 3rd one
just aside k = 0. However, it no longer has a crossing
pattern with the 4th band, which indeed shows in [001]
band structure at around k = 0.02A−1. What’s more,
instead of the [001] anti-crossing between the 4th and
5th bands, the [111] one exhibits an crossing pattern at
k = 0.02A−1. Meanwhile, the 5th and 6th bands show
the anti-crossing structure at k = 0.02A−1. For more
deeper ones, the [111] nanowire shows rather complex
valence band structures. However, these bands are not
that of interest to us compared to the band edges we have
just discussed.

The spinor distributions of [111] GaSb in general show
the similar shape and trend as the [001] ones in Figure
2(b)(d). Though in the band structure analysis we have
mentioned that [111] and [001] nanowires have diﬀerent
band groups and hierarchies, the spinor distribution of
lowest conducting band is almost the same . As a nor-
mal gap semiconductor, [111] GaSb again shows almost
indistinguishable hole part at Γ point. The same de-
creasing electron and the increasing LH component pat-
tern appeared in the ﬁgure are as well caused by the
k dependent electron-hole mixing term in the Hamilto-
nian. The spinor distribution of highest valence band
also shows great similarities. Because of band intersec-
tions, the diagram has an abruption as the [001] one does.
With LH dominating near Γ point and HH in larger k
points, the largest component switching rule is coincide
with the [001] spinor distribution. However, diﬀerences
appear in the speciﬁc details of the largest component of

”camel-back” structure in the band analysis, the largest
component of [111] 24.8nm GaSb also experience climb-
ing and descending feature while in [001] only descend-
ing appears. Furthermore, the magnitude of Γ point LH
component goes through a large decrease from [001] to
[111], showed by the nearly 97% and approximately 80%
LH component respectively. This spinor distribution dif-
ference tells that the hole mixing near Γ point in [111]
GaSb is heavier than that in [001] GaSb nanowires.

higher side ring peak and more deep valley, though the
minimum still does not reach zero in magnitude. The 5th
one, which shaped just as the 1st valence band state, is
not at all like the [001] corresponding two-ring structure
wave function. To conclude, the [111] GaSb possess the
alike conducting wave functions with the [001] GaSb but
not the valence ones. The wave function diﬀerences in-
cluding the minimum level change in conducting states
and the shape alteration in valence states are the result
of comprehensive direction changes, which is essentially
physical rather than cross-section transformation.

B.

InSb: Band Properties and Cross-Section

Discussion in [111] Direction

In Figure 12(a)(c) we have plot the [111] band struc-
ture of InSb with a H = 24.8nm hexagon crosse-section.
The conducting bands are just like the parabola shape
bands of [111] GaSb, but diﬀerent in the energy dis-
tance between the two near-degenerated energy bands.
Since InSb has a gap of 0.235eV which is far smaller
than 0.81eV of GaSb, the electron-hole mixing strength
is without double more powerful. Thus the conducting
band experiences more inﬂuence from the valence band
and results in the larger energy separation between the
original degenerated bands. As for the valence bands, the
top one exhibits ”camel-back” and ”side-peak” structure
and the 2nd highest valence band(counted by the order
on the Γ point) forms a scissor structure with the 3rd one.
Though possess the same structure as the [111] GaSb va-
lence bands, the 1st and 2nd bands show smaller energy
distance at Γ point. For more deeper bands, the [111]
InSb demonstrates unique band pattern and structure.
Diﬀerent absolute energy positions and curvatures for the
4-6th valence bands could be found in Figure 12(a)(c)
compared to [111] GaSb. In particular, the anti-crossing
point of k = 0.015A−1 [111] InSb formed between the
4th and 6th bands are diﬀerent from GaSb’s 5th and 6th
one, which is more clearly shown in the series calculation
of Figure 19 and Figure 18.

The evidence of InSb as a narrow gap semiconductor
could be clearly found in the spinor distributions in Fig-
ure 13(a)(b).
In the Fig we have plot the spinor dis-
tribution of the lowest conducting band and the highest
valence band of InSb with H = 24.8nm hexagon cross-
section. The function of conducting band looks the same
as the one in Figure 3 of [001] InSb. The HH com-
ponent at Γ has signiﬁcantly entered into the conduct-
ing band, accompanied by the increasing LH component
when k increases. The spinor distribution of highest va-
lence band looks a little diﬀerence with [001] InSb and
[111] GaSb. Near the Γ point the spinor function shows
an non-monotone trend rather than the [001] monotone
ones; the magnitude of the LH peak is slightly below 80%,
which manifests a stronger LH and HH mixing compared
to [111] GaSb. The hole spinor distribution meets with
a crossing at around k = 0.03A−1. This is the transition

FIG. 15. [111] InSb wave function with a circlar cross-section
(R=22.57nm)

Let’s move on to the wave function analysis of [111]
GaSb nanowire in Figure 11. The [111] conducting wave
functions have some common features with the [001] ones.
The lowest conducting state, which shows a beautiful cir-
cular shape peak in the center, has wave function fast de-
cay on the boundary as the [001] one. The 2nd and 3rd
states, possessing the near-degenerated energy in band
structure, show ringlike peaks on the hexagon boundary
and together with deep holes in the center. The center
minima of the two states actually do not equate zero and
not form an perfect P-node because of the electron-hole
interaction. Though mixing is small at Γ point for GaSb,
the slightly entered hole component destructs the perfect
P-shape and results in a non-zero minimum GaSb wave
function. This phenomenon will be pronounced in nar-
row gap semiconductors, as we will see in Figure 12 of
[111] InSb wave functions (In fact [001] InSb and GaSb
has shown this feature in Figure 6 and Figure 8). The
next two wave functions form one peak on each of the
six corner and perfectly match the hexagon boundary
shape condition of the [111] nanowire. The electron-hole
mixing eﬀect, which could not be neglected in the last
two states, actually have no essential eﬀect to the mini-
mum of these two wave function, and both have minima
of zero bottom and possess nodes in the center of their
cross-sections. As for the valence wave functions, most
states show totally diﬀerent pattern compared to [001]
with little exceptions. The 1st valence band state ex-
hibits the similar structure as the 2nd and 3rd conduct-
ing states, except that the center hole reaches the zero
ground here. The electron inﬂuence is not that strong to
valence states with regard to hole to conducting states.
The 2nd valence band state shows one solo hole peak
as the 1st conducting state, only with smaller size. For
these two states, though the corresponding bands are not
the same as the [001] ones, are actually only diﬀerent in
band order. The other states, however, share little com-
mon features with the [001] GaSb wave functions. The
3rd valence band state has two group of peaks, with the
larger one in the center and the smaller one around it.
In between the high points is a ring shape valley hanging
above the zero ground. With the same two peak struc-
tures as the last wave function, the 4th one has more

gesting the necessity of band order consideration when
comparing these two materials.

In the Figure 12(b)(d), we have also plot the circle
cross-section InSb nanowire in order to discuss the cross-
section inﬂuence to the whole nanowire bands. The ra-
dius of the circular InSb is set at 22.57nm, by which
it shares the same cross-section area with the hexagon
one. The conducting bands in Figure 12(b) show little
diﬀerence with the one in (a), expect for the energy sep-
aration distance between the 7th and 8th bands. The va-
lence bands of top six mostly look alike, while the deeper
ones show minor diﬀerences which could actually be over-
looked if one are not interested. From the two ﬁgures
we could see that the conducting bands and the valence
bands of the two cross-section nanowires are almost the
same. Our cross-section analysis in [111] direction is ac-
cord with the [111] InP nanowire discussion in Lassen et
al.36, where they only discuss the valence band and omit
the conducting comparison. The cross-section shape dis-
cussion could be reexamined through the wave function
comparison in Figure 15. Though with circular boundary
condition, the wave function distribution for the energy
states list here are more or less the same compared to the
hexagon ones. The only diﬀerence occurs in the symme-
try related part, where the hexagon has the D6 symmetry
while the circular one has D∞. Nevertheless the diﬀer-
ence is not that pronounced as in [001] nanowire.
In
our conclusion, for computational convenience it’s may
appropriate to assume circle cross-section in computing
[111]-oriented nanowires even if the actual cross-section
is hexagon.

the two hole components.

Figure 14 reveals wave functions of the lowest ﬁve con-
ducting and valence bands at Γ point. The Wave func-
tions in Figure 14(b)(c) show a higher value of centre
minimum than GaSb, which demonstrates a more signif-
icant hole contribution in InSb mateiral. For the valence
band wave functions, InSb exhibit an switched order of
the 4th and 5th wave functions compared to GaSb, sug-

InAs: Series Calculation in [111] Direction

Until now we have discussed the band properties of
[111] GaSb and InSb nanowires for certain side length.
In the following part we will step one further to per-
form the series analysis, taking the InAs nanowire as

an example.
In Figure 16 and Figure 17 we have pro-
vided the band structures and top ﬁve state wave func-
tions of [111] oriented InAs nanowires with hexagon
side length ranges among 5nm, 10nm, 30nm, 50nm re-
spectively. Though there exist several diﬀerences among
the four band structures, the whole series looks similar

The conducting bands
all possess the same parabola shape and degeneracy just
like [111] GaSb and InSb Figure 10 and Figure 12, except
for the shrinking energy separation between the near de-
generated bands with nanowire size increasing. In fact,
not only the degeneracy becomes indistinguishable, the
separation distance of the whole bands is persistently re-
ducing, which lead to a bulk material band structure
limitation. For the valence band structures of (e)-(h),
all top valence band show the ”camel-back” structure.
In addition, the scissor shape exists for all the 2nd and
3rd bands. One signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the 5nm
case with other ones lies in the structure of the 1st and
2nd valence bands, where in 5nm InAs they almost touch
each other while in others they do not. This results
in the wave function switching in Figure 17(a)(b) with
(f)(g),(k)(l) and(p)(q), where we have plot the top ﬁve
wave functions of InAs nanowire respectively in row. We
clearly see the 1st and 2nd state replaces each other’s
position when we increase H from 5nm to 10nm. The al-
teration could be understood by the conﬁnement eﬀect to
diﬀerent shape wave functions, just as we have point out
in [001] InAs 1st and 2nd valence wave function anal-
ysis. Other diﬀerences about the series InAs nanowire
band structure lie in the 4th-6th valence bands. In the
H = 5nm nanowire, the 4th and the 5th band still main-
tain an clearly seen distance at Γ while in larger nanowire
it disappears. This diﬀerence could be noticed from the
wave function as well. The 4th and 5th wave functions
of the 1st and 2nd rows in Figure 17 go though a mixing
strength change, while the 2nd and 3rd, 3rd and 4th rows
experience the similar wave function alteration between
these two states. As for the 6th band, the ﬁrst diagram
sees a climbing valence band while others see ﬂat pattern
near k = 0. For those bands beneath the 6th one diﬀer-
ence still exist in the band distribution and intersecting
points. However, we clearly see an saturation trend from
10nm to 50nm, towards which the energy band shapes
gradually become unviolated. With weakening quantum
conﬁnement eﬀect, the band structures ﬁnally loose the
details of the eight-group sub-bands and result in a bulk
band structure.

In Figure 18 and Figure 19 we also the serial band
structures for [111] GaSb and InSb. Since the k.p are
capable to handle larger size nanowires, here we set the
H parameter to 10nm, 30nm, 50nm and 80nm respec-
tively. Though the two band structure ﬁgures are in gen-
eral very like the InAs one, diﬀerences still exist among
the three materials due to their diﬀerent band parame-
ters. For the conducing bands, the energy distance of the
two near-degenerated bands decrease in the order InSb,
InAs and GaSb, which just corresponds the decreasing
electron-hole interaction strength order of the three ma-
terial. However, for the distance between the 1st and
2nd valence band at Γ, the sequence change direction.
The GaSb possess the closet spacing which followed by
InAs then InSb if we take the near saturated band struc-
ture H = 50nm as example. This is accompanied by the

14

inverse order of the opening length in the scissor shape
between the 2nd and 3rd valence bands. As for the more
deeper valence bands, three band parameter sets domi-
nate the band trends and diﬀerent band structures ap-
pear.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have derived the eight-band k.p hamil-
tonian in the [111] direction and give a compact matrix
form (17) for computation. By using the ﬁnite element
method with our unique mixed-element basis we have
eﬀectively suppress the annoying Gibbs-phenomenon at
the boundary of nanowires. Then we discuss the diﬀerent
band properties, spinor distribution and wave function
comparison of [001] GaSb and InSb to see the diﬀerences
of the two material. We have in addition re-examine
the usual circle cross-section assumption with the more
authentic square cross-section in [001] InAs, and have
point out the necessity for a square cross-section descrip-
tion for [001]-oriented nanowires. Next we compute the
[111] GaSb, InSb and InAs and related importance top-
ics. Compared to [001] direction, the [111] GaSb conduct-
ing bands all show perfect parabolic dispersions while
the valence bands have completely diﬀerent shapes. We
also ﬁnd the InSb cross-section selection between circle
and hexagon in [111] is not that pronounced compared to
[001], since the symmetry is relatively close. The series
computation of InAs support the valence band movement
with size increasing, and the switching of top valence
wave function from S to P suggesting a potential appli-
cation if the VBM wave function shape is of signiﬁcant
importance.

In this appendix the FEM formulas of the nanowire de-
scribed by eight-band k.p Hamiltonian would be brieﬂy
present, together with the related stiﬀ matrix expres-
sions. The eigenvalue equation of the nanowire under
eight-band k.p theory could be summarized in the block

the framework of FEM the coordinate space is divided
into mutual exclusive elements {e1, e2,···}, upon which
the real-space based shape functions {Ne1, Ne2 ,···} are
deﬁned. The domain of each basis Ne is restrict to its
