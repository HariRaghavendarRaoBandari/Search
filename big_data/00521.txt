AN EXPONENTIAL-TYPE UPPER BOUND FOR FOLKMAN NUMBERS

VOJTĚCH RÖDL, ANDRZEJ RUCIŃSKI, AND MATHIAS SCHACHT

Abstract. For given integers k and r, the Folkman number f pk; rq is the smallest number
of vertices in a graph G which contains no clique on k ` 1 vertices, yet for every partition
of its edges into r parts, some part contains a clique of order k. The existence (ﬁniteness)
of Folkman numbers was established by Folkman (1970) for r “ 2 and by Nešetřil and
Rödl (1976) for arbitrary r, but these proofs led to very weak upper bounds on f pk; rq.

Recently, Conlon and Gowers and independently the authors obtained a doubly exponen-
tial bound on f pk; 2q. Here, we establish a further improvement by showing an upper bound
on f pk; rq which is exponential in a polynomial function of k and r. This is comparable to
the known lower bound 2Ωprkq.

Our proof relies on a recent result of Saxton and Thomason (2015) (or, alternatively, on
a recent result of Balogh, Morris, and Samotij (2015)) from which we deduce a quantitative
version of Ramsey’s theorem in random graphs.

§1. Introduction

For two graphs, G and F , and an integer r ě 2 we write G Ñ pFqr if every r-coloring of
the edges of G results in a monochromatic copy of F . By a copy we mean here a subgraph
of G isomorphic to F . Let Kk stand for the complete graph on k vertices and let Rpk; rq be
the r-color Ramsey number, that is, the smallest integer n such that Kn Ñ pKkqr. As it is
customary, we suppress r “ 2 and write Rpkq :“ Rpk; 2q as well as G Ñ F for G Ñ pFq2.

In 1967 Erdős and Hajnal [8] asked if for some ℓ, k ` 1 ď ℓ ă Rpkq, there exists a graph G
such that G Ñ Kk and G Č Kℓ. Graham [12] answered this question positively for k “ 3
and ℓ “ 6 (with a graph on eight vertices), and Pósa (unpublished) for k “ 3 and ℓ “ 5.
Folkman [10] proved, by an explicit construction, that such a graph exists for every k ě 3
and ℓ “ k ` 1. He also raised the question to extend his result for more than two colors,
since his construction was bound to two colors.

For integers k and r, a graph G is called pk; rq-Folkman if G Ñ pKkqr and G Č Kk`1. We

deﬁne the r-color Folkman number for Kk by

fpk; rq “ mintn P N : D G such that |V pGq| “ n and G is pk; rq-Folkmanu .

For r “ 2 we set fpkq :“ fpk; 2q. It follows from [10] that fpkq is well deﬁned for every
integer k, i.e., fpkq ă 8. This was extended by Nešetřil and Rödl [17], who showed that
fpk; rq ă 8 for an arbitrary number of colors r.

Already the determination of fp3q is a diﬃcult, open problem. In 1975, Erdős [7] oﬀered
max(100 dollars, 300 Swiss francs) for a proof or disproof of fp3q ă 1010. For the history of
improvements of this bound see [5], where a computer assisted construction is given yielding
fp3q ă 1000. For general k, the only previously known upper bounds on fpkq come from
the constructive proofs in [10] and [17]. However, these bounds are tower functions of height
polynomial in k. On the other hand, since fpkq ě Rpkq, it follows by the well known lower
bound on the Ramsey number that fpkq ě 2k{2, which for k “ 3 was improved to fp3q ě 19
(see [19]).

We prove an upper bound on fpk; rq which is exponential in a polynomial of k and r. Set
R :“ Rpk; rq for the r-color Ramsey number for Kk. It is known that there exists some c ą 0
such that for every r ě 2 and k ě 3 we have

2crk ă R ă rrk .

The upper bound already appeared in the work of Skolem [25]. The lower bound obtained
from a random r-coloring of the complete graphs is of the form rk{2. However, Lefmann [14]
noted that the simple inequality Rpk; s`tq ě pRpk; sq´1qpRpk; tq´1q`1 yields a lower bound
of the form 2kr{4. Using iteratively random 3-colorings in this “product-type” construction
yields a slightly better lower bound of the form 3rk{6. Our main result establishes an upper
bound on the Folkman number fpk; rq of similar order of magnitude.
Theorem 1. For all integers r ě 2 and k ě 3,
R40k2

ď 2cpk4 log k`k3r log rq .

fpk; rq ď k400k4
for some c ą 0 independent of r and k.

To prove Theorem 1, we consider a random graph Gpn, pq, p “ Cn´

k`1 , where n “ npk, rq
and C “ Cpn, k, rq and carefully estimate from below the probabilities PpGpn, pq Ñ pKkqrq
and PpGpn, pq Č Kk`1q, so that their sum is strictly greater than 1. The latter probability
is easily bounded by the FKG inequality. However, to set a bound on PpGpn, pq Ñ pKkqrq
we rely on a recent general result of Saxton and Thomason [24], elaborating on ideas of

2

Nenadov and Steger [15] (see Remark 3).

AN EXPONENTIAL-TYPE UPPER BOUND FOR FOLKMAN NUMBERS

Remark 1. Instead of the Saxton-Thomason theorem, we could have used a concurrent

result of Balogh, Morris, and Samotij [1], which, by using our method, yields only a slightly
worse upper bound on the Folkman numbers fpk; rq than Theorem 1 (the k4 in the exponent
has to be replaced k6).

Remark 2. In [23], we combined ideas from [9, 20, 22] and, for r “ 2, obtained another
proof of the Ramsey threshold theorem that yields a self-contained derivation of a double-
exponential bound for the two-color Folkman numbers fpkq. Independently, a similar double-
exponential bound for fpk; rq, for r ě 2, was obtained by Conlon and Gowers [2] by a diﬀerent
method.

Motivated by the original question of Erdős and Hajnal, one can also deﬁne, for r “ 2,

k ě 3, and k ` 1 ď ℓ ď Rpkq, a relaxed Folkman number as

fpk, ℓq “ mintn : there exists G such that |V pGq| “ n , G Ñ Kk , and G Č Kℓu.

Note that fpk, k ` 1q “ fpkq. As mentioned above, Graham [12] showed fp3, 6q “ 8, while
Nenov [16] and Piwakowski, Radziszowski and Urbański [18] determined that fp3, 5q “ 15
(see also [26]). Of course, the problem is easier when the diﬀerence ℓ´ k is bigger. Our ﬁnal
result provides an exponential bound of the form fpk, ℓq ď expp´ckq, when ℓ is close to but
bigger than 4k (the constant c is proportional to the reciprocal of the diﬀerence between ℓ{k
and 4).

Theorem 2. For every 0 ă α ă 1
and k ď αℓ we have fpk; ℓq ď 24k{p1´4αq.
It would be interesting to decide if the true order of the logarithm of fpk, k ` 1q “ fpkq is
also linear in k.

4 there exists k0 such that for k and ℓ satisfying k ě k0

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we prove our main result, Theorem 1,

while Theorem 2 is proved in Section 3. Finally, a short Section 4 oﬀers a brief discussion of

the analogous problem for hypergraphs. Most logarithms in this paper are binary and are

denoted by log. Only occasionally, when citing a result from [24] (Theorem 5 in Section 2

below), we will use the natural logarithms, denoted by ln.

§2. Proof of Theorem 1

We will prove Theorem 1 by the probabilistic method. Let Gpn, pq be the binomial random
graph, where each of the `n
2˘ possible edges is present, independently, with probability p.
We are going to show that for every n ě k40k4
and a suitable function p “ ppnq,
with positive probability, Gpn, pq has simultaneously two properties: Gpn, pq Ñ pKkqr and
Gpn, pq Č Kk`1. Of course, this will imply that there exists an pk; rq-Folkman graph on n
vertices. We begin with a simple lower bound on PpGpn, pq Č Kk`1q.
Lemma 3. For all k, n ě 3, and C ą 0, if p “ Cn´2{pk`1q ď 1

PpGpn, pq Č Kk`1q ą expp´Cpk`1

The main ingredient of the proof of Theorem 1 traces back to a theorem from [20] estab-
lishing edge probability thresholds for Ramsey properties of Gpn, pq. A special case of that
result states that for all integers k ě 3 and r ě 2 there exists a constant C such that if

on a result of Saxton and Thomason [24], we obtain the following quantitative version of the
above random graph theorem. Recall that R “ Rpk; rq denotes the r-color Ramsey number

valid for all r ě 2 and k ě 3 (just consider a factorization of K2r).

from Lemmas 3 and 4.

Proof of Theorem 1. For given r and k, let n be as in (2), and let b, C, and p be as in (3).

PpGpn, pq Ñ pKkqr and Gpn, pq Č Kk`1q ą 0.

Thus, there exists a pk; rq-Folkman graph on n vertices, and thus, fpkq ď k400k4

and hence, (6) indeed follows from (4).

Finally, we establish (4). In doing so we will use again the identity 3{b
as the inequalities 36 ď C, which follows from (2) and (3), `k`2

k´1 ď 2, valid for all k ě 3. The R-H-S of (4) can be bounded from above by

This, however, follows trivially from (2).

2.1. The proof of Lemma 4 – preparations. In this and the next subsection we present

a proof of Lemma 4, which is inspired by the work of Nenadov and Steger [15] and is based

on a recent general result of Saxton and Thomason [24] on the distribution of indepen-
dent sets in hypergraphs. For a hypergraph H, a subset I Ď V pHq is independent if the
subhypergraph HrIs induced by I in H has no edges.

For an h-graph H, the degree dpJq of a set J Ă V pHq is the number of edges of H
containing J. (Since in our paper letter r is reserved for the number of colors, we will use h
for hypergraph uniformity.) We will write dpvq for dptvuq, the ordinary vertex degree. We
further deﬁne, for a vertex v P V pHq and j “ 2, . . . , h, the maximum j-degree of v as

Finally, the co-degree function of H with a formal variable τ is deﬁned in [24] as

where the inner sum is taken over all vertices v P V pHq and d is the average vertex degree
in H, that is, d “ 1

Theorem 5 below is an abridged version of [24, Corollary 3.6], where we suppress part of
conclusion (a ) (about the sets Ti), as well as the “Moreover” part therein, since we do not
use this additional information here. In part (c ) of the theorem below, for convenience, we
switch from ln to log, but only on the R-H-S of the upper bound on ln|C|.
Theorem 5 (Saxton & Thomason, [24]). Let H be an h-graph on vertex set rns and let ε
and τ be two real numbers such that 0 ă ε ă 1{2,

τ ď 1{p144ph!q2hq

and

δpH, τq ď ε{p12ph!qq.

Then there exists a collection C of subsets of rns such that the following three properties hold.

(a ) For every independent set I in H there exists a set C P C such that I Ă C.
(b ) For all C P C, we have epHrCsq ď εepHq.
(c ) We have ln|C| ď c logp1{εqτ logp1{τqn, where c “ 800ph!q3h.
We will now tailor the above result to our application. The hypergraphs we consider have
a very symmetric structure. Given k and n, let Hpn, kq be the hypergraph with vertex

The most important property of hypergraph Hpn, kq is that a subset S of the vertices
of H corresponds to a graph G with vertex set rns and edge set S, and S is an independent
set in Hpn, kq if and only if the corresponding graph G is Kk-free. We apply Theorem 5
to Hpn, kq.

In the next subsection we deduce Lemma 4 from Corollary 7. First, however, we make a
simple observation about the number of monochromatic copies of Kk in every coloring of Kn.
Recall that R “ Rpk; rq is the r-color Ramsey number for Kk and set

Proposition 8. Let n ě R. For every pr ` 1q-coloring of the edges of Kn either there are

Proof. Consider an pr ` 1q-coloring of the edges of Kn. Let x` n
R˘ be the number of the R-
element subsets of the vertices of Kn with no edge colored by color r ` 1. By the deﬁnition
of R, each of these subsets induces in Kn a monochromatic copy of Kk. Thus, counting
repetitions, there are at least

monochromatic copies of Kk colored by one of the ﬁrst r colors. Suppose that their number

properties (a )–(c ) of Corollary 7 are satisﬁed for these speciﬁc values of ε and τ .

r

To continue with the proof of Lemma 4 consider a random graph Gpn, pq and let E be
the event that Gpn, pq Û pKkqr. For each G P E, there exists an r-coloring ϕ : EpGq Ñ rrs
yielding no monochromatic copy of Kk. (Further on we will call such a coloring proper.)
In other words, there are Kk-free graphs G1, . . . , Gr, deﬁned by Gi “ ϕ´1piq, such that
G1 Y¨ . . . Y¨ Gr “ G. According to Property (a) of Corollary 7, for every i P rrs there exists a
graph Ci P C such that Gi Ď Ci. Consequently,
G X˜Kn r

Notice that there are only at most |C|r distinct graphs Kn rŤr
i“1 Ci. Moreover, we next
show that all these graphs are dense (see Claim 10). Hence, as it is extremely unlikely for a
random graph Gpn, pq to be completely disjoint from one of the few given dense graphs, it
will ultimately follow that PpEq “ op1q.

this coloring may not be unique, as the graphs Ci are not necessarily mutually disjoint.) By

log n ě 16). This completes the proof of Lemma 4.
Remark 3. The idea of utilizing hypergraph containers for Ramsey properties of random

graphs comes from a recent paper by Nenadov and Steger [15] (see also [11, Chapter 7])

where the authors give a short proof of the main theorem from [20] establishing an edge
probability threshold for the property Gpn, pq Ñ pFqr. Let us point to some similarities and
diﬀerences between their and our approach. For clarity of the comparison, let us restrict
ourselves to the case F “ Kk considered in our paper (the generalization to an arbitrary
graph F is quite straightforward).

AN EXPONENTIAL-TYPE UPPER BOUND FOR FOLKMAN NUMBERS

13

In [15] the goal is to prove an asymptotic result with n Ñ 8 and all other parameters
ﬁxed. Consequently, they do not optimize, or even specify constants. Our task is to provide

as good as possible upper bound on n in terms of k and r, so there is no asymptotics.

The observation that a Kk-free coloring of the edges of Gpn, pq yields r independent sets in
the hypergraph Hpn, kq, and therefore, by the Saxton-Thomason Theorem there are r graphs
Ci, i “ 1, . . . , r, each with only a few copies of Kk, whose union contains all the edges of
Gpn, pq, was made in [15]. Also there one can ﬁnd a statement similar to our Proposition 8
(cf. [15, Corollary 3].) These two facts lead to similar estimates of the probability that
Gpn, pq is not Ramsey. However, Nenadov and Steger, assuming that C is a constant, are
forced to use Theorem 2.3 from [24] which involves the sequences of sets Ti. In our setting,
we choose C “ Cpnq in a balanced way, allowing us to go through with the estimates of
PpGpn, pq Û pKkqrq without introducing the Ti’s, while, on the other hand, keeping the
upper bound on n exponential in k. In fact, as observed by Conlon and Gowers [2], the

approach via random graphs cannot yield a better than double-exponential upper bound on

n if one assumes that p is at the Ramsey threshold, i.e., if C is a constant.

§3. Relaxed Folkman numbers

In this section we prove Theorem 2. We will need an elementary fact about Ramsey
properties of quasi-random graphs. For constants ̺ and d with 0 ă d, ̺ ď 1, we say that an
n-vertex graph Γ is p̺, dq-dense if every induced subgraph on m ě ̺n vertices contains at
least dpm2{2q edges. It follows by an easy averaging argument that it suﬃces to check the
above inequality only for m “ r̺ns. Note also that every induced subgraph of a p̺, dq-dense
n-vertex graph on at least cn vertices is p ̺
c , dq-dense. It turns out that for a suitable choice
of the parameters, p̺, dq-dense graphs are Ramsey.
Proposition 12. For every integer k ě 2 and every d P p0, 1q the following holds.
n ě p2{dq2k´4 and 0 ă ̺ ď pd{2q2k´4, then every two-colored n-vertex p̺, dq-dense graph Γ
contains a monochromatic copy of Kk.

If

Proof. For a two-coloring of the edges of a graph Γ we call a sequence of vertices pv1, . . . , vℓq
canonical if for each i “ 1, . . . , ℓ ´ 1 all the edges tvi, vju, for j ą i, are of the same color.
We will ﬁrst show by induction on ℓ that for every ℓ ě 2 and d P p0, 1q, if n ě p2{dqℓ´2 and
0 ă ̺ ď pd{2qℓ´2, then every two-colored n-vertex p̺, dq-dense graph Γ contains a canonical
sequence of length ℓ.

For ℓ “ 2, every ordered pair of adjacent vertices is a canonical sequence. Assume that
the statement is true for some ℓ ě 2 and consider an n-vertex p̺, dq-dense graph Γ, where
̺ ď pd{2qℓ´1 and n ě p2{dqℓ´1. As observed above, there is a vertex u with degree at

14

VOJTĚCH RÖDL, ANDRZEJ RUCIŃSKI, AND MATHIAS SCHACHT

least dn. Let Mu be a set of at least dn{2 neighbors of u connected to u by edges of the
same color. Let Γu “ ΓrMus be the subgraph of Γ induced by the set Mu. Note that Γu
has nu ě dn{2 ě p2{dqℓ´2 vertices and is p̺u, dq-dense with ̺u ď pd{2qℓ´2. Hence, by
the induction assumption, there is a canonical sequence of length ℓ in Γu. This sequences
preceded by the vertex u makes a canonical sequence of length ℓ ` 1 in Γ.

To complete the proof of Proposition 12, set ℓ “ 2k ´ 2 above and observe that every
canonical sequence pv1, . . . , v2k´2q contains a monochromatic copy of Kk. Indeed, among the
vertices v1, . . . , v2k´3, some k ´ 1 have the same color on all the “forward” edges. These
vertices together with vertex v2k´2 form a monochromatic copy of Kk.
Proof of Theorem 2. Let n “ 24k{p1´4αq. Consider a random graph Gpn, pq where

(cid:3)

p “ 2n´ 7`4α

By elementary estimates one can bound the expected number of ℓ-cliques in Gpn, pq by

Further, by a straightforward application of Chernoﬀ’s bound (see, e.g., [13, ineq. (2.6)]),
a.a.s. Gpn, pq is p̺, p ´ oppqq-dense, where ̺ “ log2 n
n , say. Indeed, setting t “ ̺n “ log2 n,
ǫ “ ǫpnq “ plog nq´1{3, and d “ p1´ ǫqp, the probability that a ﬁxed set T of t vertices spans
in Gpn, pq fewer than dt2{2 edges is at most

Finally, note that the above bound, even multiplied by `n

subsets of vertices in Gpn, pq, still converges to zero (recall that p is a constant).
Using that ǫk “ Oplog2{3 nq one can easily verify that both assumptions of Proposition 12,
that is, n ě p2{dq2k´4 and ̺ ď pd{2q2k´4, hold true. Indeed, dropping the subtrahend 4 for

for n large enough, that is, for k large enough.

In conclusion, a.a.s. Gpn, pq is such that

‚ it contains no Kℓ, and
‚ for every two-coloring of its edges, there is a monochromatic copy of Kk.

Hence, there exists an n-vertex graph with the above two properties and, consequently,

§4. Hypergraph Folkman numbers

Hypergraph Folkman numbers are deﬁned in an analogous way to their graph counterparts.
Given three integers h, k, and r, the h-uniform Folkman number fhpk; rq is the minimum
number of vertices in an h-uniform hypergraph H such that H Ñ pKphqk qr but H Č Kphqk`1.
Here Kphqk
stands for the complete h-uniform hypergraph on k vertices, that is, one with `k
h˘
edges. The ﬁniteness of hypergraph Folkman numbers was proved by Nešetřil and Rödl

in [17, Colloary 6, page 206] and besides the gigantic upper bound stemming from their

construction, no reasonable bounds have been proven so far. Much better understood are

the vertex-Folkman numbers (where instead of edges, the vertices are colored), which for

both, graphs and hypergraphs, are bounded from above by an almost quadratic function

of k, while from below the bound is only linear in k (see [4, 6]).

The study of Ramsey properties of random hypergraphs began in [21] where a threshold
was found for Kp3q4 , the 3-uniform clique on 4 vertices. Also there a general conjecture was
stated that a theorem analogous to that in [20] holds for hypergraphs too. This was conﬁrmed

for h-partite h-uniform hypergraphs in [22], and, ﬁnally, for all h-uniform hypergraphs in [9]

and, independently, in [3].

As remarked by Nenadov and Steger in [15], the Container theorem of Saxton-Thomason

(or the Balogh-Morris-Samotij) also yields a simpler proof of the hypergraph Ramsey thresh-

old theorem from [3, 9]. We believe that, similarly, our quantitative approach should also
provide an upper bound on the hypergraph Folkman numbers fhpk; rq, exponential in a
polynomial of k and r.
