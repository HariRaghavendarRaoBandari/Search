Introduction

Let S = K[x1, . . . , xn] be the polynomial ring in n variables over a ﬁeld K, and F =

⊕m

i=1Sei (m ≥ 1) a ﬁnitely generated graded free S-module with basis e1, . . . , em in degrees

f1, . . . , fm such that f1 ≤ f2 ≤ · · · ≤ fm. The main purpose of this paper is to characterize

the possible extremal Betti numbers (values as well as positions) of a graded submodule

M of F . Precisely, the following question is analyzed.

Problem 1.1 Given two positive integers n, r, 1 ≤ r ≤ n − 1, r pairs of positive integers

(k1, ℓ1), . . ., (kr, ℓr) such that n − 1 ≥ k1 > k2 > · · · > kr ≥ 1 and 1 ≤ ℓ1 < ℓ2 < · · · <

ℓr, and r positive integers a1, . . . , ar, under which conditions does there exist a graded

submodule M of a ﬁnitely generated graded free S-module such that βk1,k1+ℓ1(M ) = a1,

. . ., βkr,kr+ℓr (M ) = ar are its extremal Betti numbers?

The extremal Betti numbers of a graded S-module M , introduced by Bayer, Char-

alambous and Popescu in [2], can be seen as a reﬁnement of the Castelnuovo-Mumford

regularity and of the projective dimension of the module M ; also, both position and value

of any extremal Betti number can be read oﬀ the local cohomology modules H i

m(M ), with

m = (x1, . . . , xn). Such special graded Betti numbers are the non-zero top left corners

in a block of zeroes in the Macaulay [16] or CoCoA Betti diagram [4] of a graded free

resolution of M . Assume K is a ﬁeld of characteristic 0. Under this hypothesis, the

generic initial module Gin(M ), with respect to the graded reverse lexicographic order, of

a graded S-module M is a strongly stable submodule [17], and the extremal Betti numbers

of M , as well as their positions, are preserved by passing from M to Gin(M ) [2, Corol-

lary 1]. Hence, Problem 1.1 is equivalent to the characterization of the possible extremal

Betti numbers of a strongly stable submodule of F . A numerical characterization of the

possible extremal Betti numbers of a graded ideal I of initial degree ≥ 3 of a standard

graded polynomial ring over a ﬁeld of characteristic 0 has been given in [10]. Recently,

Herzog, Sharifan and Varbaro [14] have given an alternative characterization (diﬀerent

in nature) of the extremal Betti numbers of such an ideal I, including also the case in

which I contains quadrics. Furthermore, the behavior of such graded Betti numbers has

been studied for the class of lexicographic submodules of a ﬁnitely generated graded free

S-module in [9, 11], and for some classes of squarefree strongly stable submodules of a

ﬁnitely generated graded free S-module in [5, 6].

The plan of the paper is as follows.

In Section 2, some notions that will be used

throughout the paper are recalled. In Section 3, the possible extremal Betti numbers of

a strongly stable ideal of initial degree 2 are determined (Propositions 3.4, 3.5); the case

when the strongly stable ideal has initial degree ≥ 3 has been analyzed and solved in

[10]. In Section 4, the possible extremal Betti numbers (positions as well as values) of

a strongly stable submodule of a ﬁnitely generated graded free S-module are computed

(Theorem 4.6). Following the approach of [10], the characterization is obtained by a

detailed description of certain sets of monomials.

2 Preliminaries

Let us consider the polynomial ring S = K[x1, . . . , xn] as an N-graded ring where each

deg xi = 1, and let F = ⊕m

i=1Sei (m ≥ 1) be a ﬁnitely generated graded free S-module

with basis e1, . . . , em, where deg(ei) = fi for each i = 1, . . . , m, with f1 ≤ f2 ≤ · · · ≤ fm.
The elements of the form xaei, where xa = xa1

n for a = (a1, . . . , an) ∈ Nn

called monomials of F , and deg(xaei) = deg(xa) + deg(ei).

1 xa2

2 . . . xan

0 , are
In particular, if F ≃ Sm

and ei = (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . , 0), where 1 appears in the i-th place, we assume, as usual,

deg(xaei) = deg(xa), i.e., deg(ei) = fi = 0.

A monomial submodule M of F is a submodule generated by monomials, i.e., M =

⊕m

i=1Iiei, where Ii are the monomial ideals of S generated by those monomials u of S such

that uei ∈ M [13]; if m = 1 and f1 = 0, then a monomial submodule is a monomial ideal

of S. If I is a monomial ideal of S, we denote by G(I) the unique minimal set of monomial

generators of I, by G(I)ℓ the set of monomials u of G(I) such that deg u = ℓ, and by

G(I)>ℓ the set of monomials u of G(I) such that deg u > ℓ. Moreover, for a monomial

1 6= u ∈ S, we set

supp(u) = {i : xi divides u},

m(u) = max{i : i ∈ supp(u)},

and m(1) = 0. A monomial ideal I of S is called stable if for all u ∈ G(I) one has

(xju)/xm(u) ∈ I for all j < m(u). I is called strongly stable if for all u ∈ G(I) one has

(xju)/xi ∈ I for all i ∈ supp(u) and all j < i [12].

Following [11], we introduce the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 2.1 A graded submodule M ⊆ F is a (strongly) stable submodule if M =

⊕m

i=1Iiei and Ii ( S is a (strongly) stable ideal of S, for any i = 1, . . . , m.

For any Z-graded ﬁnitely generated S-module M , there is a minimal graded free S-

resolution [3]

F. : 0 → Fs → · · · → F1 → F0 → M → 0,

where Fi = ⊕j∈ZS(−j)βi,j . The integers βi,j = βi,j(M ) = dimK Tori(K, M )j are called

the graded Betti numbers of M .

If M = ⊕m

i=1Iiei is a stable submodule of F , then βk, k+ℓ(M ) = βk, k+ℓ(⊕m

i=1Iiei) =

i=1 βk, k+ℓ−fi(Ii), and we can use the Eliahou-Kervaire formula [12] for computing the

Deﬁnition 2.2 [2] A graded Betti number βk,k+ℓ(M ) 6= 0 is called extremal if βi, i+j(M ) =

0 for all i ≥ k, j ≥ ℓ, (i, j) 6= (k, ℓ).

The pair (k, ℓ) is called a corner of M .

From (2.1), one can deduce the following characterization of the extremal Betti numbers

of a stable submodule.

Characterization 2.3 Let M = ⊕m

i=1Iiei be a stable submodule of F . A graded Betti

number βk, k+ℓ(M ) is extremal if and only if

k + 1 = max{m(u) : uei ∈ G(M )ℓ , i ∈ {1, . . . , m}},

and m(u) ≤ k, for all uei ∈ G(M )j and all j > ℓ.

As a consequence of the above result, one obtains that if βk, k+ℓ(M ) is an extremal Betti

number of M , then βk, k+ℓ(M ) = |{uei ∈ G(M )ℓ : m(u) = k + 1, i ∈ {1, . . . , m}}|.

For a monomial submodule M = ⊕m

i=1Iiei of F , denote by D(M ) = {I1, . . . , Im} the

set of monomial ideals appearing in its direct decomposition.

Remark 2.4 Let M = ⊕m

i=1Iiei be a stable submodule of F . If βk, k+ℓ(M ) is an extremal

Betti number of M , then there exist some stable ideals Ij1, . . . , Ijt ∈ D(M ), 1 ≤ j1 <

j2 < · · · < jt ≤ m, being (k, ℓ) a corner. Therefore, βk, k+ℓ(M ) = Pt

Finally, for later use, let us recall that for a graded ideal I = ⊕j≥0Ij of S, the initial

degree of I, denoted by α(I), is the minimum s such that Is 6= 0.

3 Strongly stable ideals of initial degree 2

In this Section, we analyze the possible extremal Betti numbers of a strongly stable ideal I

of S = K[x1, . . . , xn] of initial degree 2. The case α(I) ≥ 3 was examined and completely

solved in [10]. We will see that, if we consider Problem 1.1, the characterization of the

possible extremal Betti numbers of a strongly stable ideal I with α(I) = 2 depends on the

number r of the ﬁxed pairs of integers.

We start this Section with some comments. If S is a polynomial ring in 2 variables, then

a strongly stable ideal can have at most one extremal Betti number. If S = K[x1, x2, x3]

is a polynomial ring in 3 variables, then there exist strongly stable ideals I of initial

degree 2 in S with 2 extremal Betti numbers.

Indeed, the strongly stable ideals I =

(x2

1, x1x2, x1x3, xℓ

2), ℓ > 2, have the pairs (2, 2), (1, ℓ) as corners. These remarks justify

our next assumption on the number n of the variables of the polynomial ring S.

Denote by Mon(S) the set of monomials of S and by Mond(S) the set of monomials of

degree d of S. For u, v ∈ Mond(S), u ≥lex v, deﬁne the set

L(u, v) = {z ∈ Mond(S) : u ≥lex z ≥lex v},

where ≥lex is the usual lexicographic ordering on the polynomial ring S with respect to

the ordering of the variables x1 > x2 > · · · > xn.

Proposition 3.1 Let n ≥ 4. A strongly stable ideal I of S of initial degree 2 can have at

most n − 2 extremal Betti numbers.

Proof. If I ( S is a strongly stable ideal such that x2

2 /∈ G(I)2, and ℓ > 2 is the lowest

degree for which G(I)ℓ 6= ∅, then xℓ

2 ∈ G(I)ℓ, necessarily. This implies that there is no

extremal Betti number determined by a monomial u ∈ G(I)>ℓ with m(u) = 2. If such ℓ

does not exist, then I is generated in degree 2. More precisely, G(I) = L(cid:0)x2

with 1 ≤ k < n, whence I has just only one extremal Betti number. Furthermore, one

1, x1xk+1(cid:1),

can observe that if ℓ exists and xℓ

2 determines an extremal Betti number of I, then I

is generated only in degrees 2 and ℓ. More speciﬁcally, G(I)2 = L(cid:0)x2

1, x1xk+1(cid:1), with

2}. Thus, the ideal I can have at most two extremal Betti

1 ≤ k < n, and G(I)ℓ = {xℓ

numbers. ✷

Proposition 3.2 Let n ≥ 4. Given n − 2 pairs of positive integers

(k1, ℓ1), (k2, ℓ2), . . . , (kn−2, ℓn−2),

(3.1)

with n − 1 ≥ k1 > k2 > · · · > kn−2 ≥ 2 and ℓ1 = 2 < ℓ2 < · · · < ℓn−2, then there exists a

strongly stable ideal I of S of initial degree 2 and with the pairs in (3.1) as corners if and

only if k1 + 1 = n.

Proof. It is enough to show that, given two positive integers n, r, 1 ≤ r ≤ n − 2, r pairs

of integers

(k1, ℓ1), (k2, ℓ2), . . . , (kr, ℓr)

(3.2)

with n − 1 ≥ k1 > k2 > · · · > kr ≥ 2 and 2 = ℓ1 < ℓ2 < · · · < ℓr, then there exists a

strongly stable ideal I of S with α(I) = 2 having the pairs in (3.2) as corners.

Indeed, setting s = max{i : i ≤ ki + 1}, the required monomial ideal I can be con-

structed as follows:

1, x1xk1+1(cid:1);

- G(I)2 = L(cid:0)x2
- G(I)ℓi = L(cid:16)xℓ2−2
- G(I)ℓi =nxℓ2−2

Now, let M be a set of monomials of degree d of S. The set of monomials of degree

d + 1 of S

Shad(M) = {xiu : u ∈ M,

i = 1, . . . , n}

6

is called the shadow of M. We deﬁne the i-th shadow recursively by Shadi(M) =

Shad(Shadi−1(M)). Moreover, we denote by min(M) the smallest monomial of M with

respect to the lexicographic ordering on S. Setting w = min(M), if ℓ > d is an integer,

we deﬁne the following set of monomials of degree ℓ in S:

LexShadℓ(M) = L(xℓ

1, wxℓ−d

n );

we call such a set the lexicographic shadow of M.

Finally, given two positive integers k, d, with 1 ≤ k < n and d ≥ 2, we introduce the

following sets of monomials:

A(k, d) = {u ∈ Mond(S) : m(u) = k + 1}, A(≤ k, d) = {u ∈ Mond(S) : m(u) ≤ k + 1}.

Setting A(k, d) = {u1, . . . , uq}, we can suppose, after a permutation of the indices,

that

u1 >lex u2 >lex · · · >lex uq;

(3.3)

moreover, for the i-th monomial of degree d with m(u) = k + 1, we mean the monomial

of A(k, d) that appears in the i-th position of (3.3), for 1 ≤ i ≤ q.

From now on, we assume S = K[x1, . . . , xn] endowed with the lexicographic order >lex

induced by the ordering x1 > x2 > · · · > xn.

Proposition 3.4 Let n ≥ 4 be an integer. Let (k1, ℓ1), (k2, ℓ2) be two pairs of positive

integers such that n − 1 ≥ k1 > k2 ≥ 2 and 2 = ℓ1 < ℓ2, and let a1, a2 be two positive

integers. If K is a ﬁeld of characteristic 0, then the following conditions are equivalent:

(1) there exists a graded ideal J ( S, with extremal Betti numbers βk1,k1+ℓ1(J) =

a1, βk2,k2+ℓ2(J) = a2;

(2) there exists a strongly stable ideal I ( S, with extremal Betti numbers βk1,k1+ℓ1(I) =

a1, βk2,k2+ℓ2(I) = a2;

(3) the integers ai satisfy the conditions:

1 ≤ ai ≤ |Ai \ LexShadℓi−ℓi−1(Ai−1)|,

for i = 1, 2,

where A0 = ∅, A1 = {u ∈ A(k1, ℓ1 = 2) : u ≥lex xk2xk1+1} and A2 = {u ∈ A(k2, ℓ2) :
u ≥lex xℓ2

k2+1}.

Proof. (1) ⇔ (2). Since char(K) = 0, then the generic initial ideal Gin(J) = I is a

strongly stable ideal and the assertion follows from [2, Corollary 1].

(2) ⇒ (3). First of all note that A2\LexShadℓ2−2(A1) 6= ∅. In fact, A2\LexShadℓ2−2(A1) =
{xℓ2

k2+1}. Suppose a1 > |A1|. Therefore, the greatest monomial u ∈ G(I)2 with m(u) =
k1 + 1 following xk2xk1+1 is u = xk2+1xk1+1. Since I is a strongly stable ideal, then

x2
k2+1 ∈ G(I)2. Hence, the corner (k2, ℓ2) does not exist. A contradiction. Finally, it is
easy to check that a2 ≤ |A2 \ LexShadℓ2−2(A1)|. Indeed, xℓ2
k2+1 is the smallest monomial

belonging to A(k2, ℓ2).
(3) ⇒ (2). Denote by m(ai) the ai-th monomial of Ai \ LexShadℓi−ℓi−1(Ai−1), i = 1, 2.

We construct a strongly stable ideal I of S in degrees ℓ1 = 2 < ℓ2, using the following
criterion: G(I)2 = {v ∈ A(≤ k1, 2) : x2
m(a1)xℓ2−2

Proposition 3.5 Given two positive integers n, r (n ≥ 5) such that 2 < r ≤ n − 2, let

(k1, ℓ1), (k2, ℓ2),

. . . , (kr, ℓr) be r pairs of positive integers with n − 1 ≥ k1 > k2 > · · · >

kr ≥ 2 and 2 = ℓ1 < ℓ2 < · · · < ℓr, and let a1, a2, . . . , ar be r positive integers.

If K is a ﬁeld of characteristic 0, then the following conditions are equivalent:

(1) there exists a graded ideal J ( S, with extremal Betti numbers βki,ki+ℓi(J) = ai, for

i = 1, . . . , r;

(2) there exists a strongly stable ideal I ( S, with extremal Betti numbers βki,ki+ℓi(I) =

ai, for i = 1, . . . , r;

(3) set t = max{i : ℓi ≤ r − i}; the integers ai satisfy the conditions:

1 ≤ ai ≤ |Ai \ LexShadℓi−ℓi−1(Ai−1)|,

for i = 1, . . . , r

where A0 = ∅ and

(i) A1 = {u ∈ A(k1, ℓ1) : u ≥lex xkr−1xk1+1};

(ii) Ai = {u ∈ A(ki, ℓi) : u ≥lex xkr · · · xkr−ℓi+3xkr−ℓi+2−1xki+1}, for i = 2, . . . , t;

Proof. (1) ⇔ (2). See Proposition 3.4, (1) ⇔ (2).

(2) ⇒ (3). At ﬁrst, one can observe that Ai \LexShadℓi−ℓi−1(Ai−1) 6= ∅, for all i = 1, . . . , r.
Indeed, if ℓ2 ≤ r − 2, then A2 \ LexShadℓ2−2(A1) = {u ∈ A(k2, ℓ2) : xℓ2−1

Suppose a1 > |A1|. The greatest monomial u ∈ G(I)2 with m(u) = k1 + 1 following

xkr−1xk1+1 is u = xkr xk1+1, and consequently, since I is a strongly stable ideal, then
xℓ2
kr+1 ∈ G(I)ℓ2 . Hence, the corner (kr, ℓr) does not exist. A contradiction.
Now, set T = {ℓi : ℓi ≤ r − i}, for i ∈ {2, . . . , r}. We distinguish two cases: T = ∅ and

T 6= ∅.

(Case 1). Assume T = ∅. Let 2 ≤ i < r be the smallest integer such that ai > |Ai \
LexShadℓi−ℓi−1(Ai−1)|. Then G(I)ℓi contains the monomial xkr xkr−1 · · · xki+2xℓi−(r−i)
which is the greatest monomial of A(ki, ℓi) following xkr · · · xki+1xℓi−(r−i)
LexShadℓi−ℓi−1(Ai−1)). Since ℓ2 ≥ 3, using the same arguments as in [10, Theorem 3.1],
one has that G(I)ℓr−1 contains the monomial xℓr−1

kr+1. Hence, (kr, ℓr) is not a corner of I.

A contradiction.

(Case 2). Assume T 6= ∅. Let 2 ≤ i ≤ t be the smallest integer such that ai > |Ai \
LexShadℓi−ℓi−1(Ai−1)|. Then G(I)ℓi contains the monomial xkr . . . xkr−ℓi+3xkr−ℓi+2xki+1,
which is the greatest monomial of A(ki, ℓi) following xkr · · · xkr−ℓi+3xkr−ℓi+2−1xki+1 =
min(Ai \ LexShadℓi−ℓi−1(Ai−1)). Therefore, using again the same arguments as in [10,
Theorem 3.1], one can verify that the monomial xkr . . . xkr−ℓi+3xℓt+1−(ℓi−1)
to G(I)ℓt+1, and since xkr . . . xkr−ℓi+3xℓt+1−(ℓi−1)

(3) ⇒ (2) The proof is quite similar to Proposition 3.4. Denote by m(ai) the ai-th mono-

mial of Ai \ Shadℓi−ℓi−1(Ai−1), 1 ≤ i ≤ r. We construct a strongly stable ideal I of S in

degrees ℓ1 = 2 < ℓ2 < · · · < ℓr, using the following criterion: G(I)2 = {v ∈ A(≤ k1, ℓ1 =

✷

Remark 3.6 A strongly stable ideal I ( S with α(I) ≥ 3 can have at most n−1 extremal

Betti numbers; the possible extremal Betti numbers of such an ideal (positions as well as

values) have been characterized in [10, Theorem 3.1].

Next characterization covers both the case considered in [10, Theorem 3.1] and the one

in Proposition 3.5.

Theorem 3.7 Given two positive integers n, r such that 1 ≤ r ≤ n−1, let (k1, ℓ1), (k2, ℓ2),

. . . , (kr, ℓr) be r pairs of positive integers with n − 1 ≥ k1 > k2 > · · · > kr ≥ 1 and

2 ≤ ℓ1 < ℓ2 < · · · < ℓr, and let a1, a2, . . . , ar be r positive integers.

If K is a ﬁeld of characteristic 0, then the following conditions are equivalent:

(1) there exists a graded ideal J ( S, with extremal Betti numbers βki,ki+ℓi(J) = ai, for

i = 1, . . . , r;

(2) there exists a strongly stable ideal I ( S, with extremal Betti numbers βki,ki+ℓi(I) =

ai, for i = 1, . . . , r;

(3) set t = max{i : ℓi ≤ r − i}; the integers ai satisfy the conditions:

1 ≤ ai ≤ |Ai \ LexShadℓi−ℓi−1(Ai−1)|,

for i = 1, . . . , r,

where A0 = ∅ and

(i) A1 = {u ∈ A(k1, ℓ1) : u ≥lex xkr−1xk1+1}, whenever ℓ1 = 2;

(ii) Ai = {u ∈ A(ki, ℓi) : u ≥lex xkr · · · xkr−ℓi+3xkr−ℓi+2−1xki+1}, for i = 1, . . . , t,

whenever ℓ1 ≥ 3, and for i = 2, . . . , t, whenever ℓ1 = 2;

(iii) Ai = {u ∈ A(ki, ℓi) : u ≥lex xkr · · · xki+1xℓi−(r−i)

ki+1

}, for i = t + 1, . . . , r − 1;

(iv) Ar = {u ∈ A(kr, ℓr) : u ≥lex xℓr

kr+1},

10

with 2 < r ≤ n − 2 (it has to be n ≥ 5), kr ≥ 2, whenever ℓ1 = 2, and 1 ≤ r ≤ n − 1,

kr ≥ 1, whenever ℓ1 ≥ 3.

4 Possible corners

In this Section, we determine the possible corners (values and positions) of a strongly stable

submodule of the ﬁnitely generated graded free S-module Sm, m ≥ 1, with standard basis

e1, . . . , em, where ei is the m-tuple whose only non–zero entry is a 1 in the i-th position,

and such that deg(ei) = 0, for all i.

Let us introduce some notations. For a ﬁnitely generated graded S-module M , we

denote by Corn(M ) the set of all its corners, i.e.,

Corn(M ) = {(k, ℓ) ∈ N × N : βk,k+ℓ(M ) is an extremal Betti number of M }.

If M = ⊕m

j=1Ijej is a monomial submodule of the ﬁnitely generated graded free S-

module F = ⊕m

i=1Sei, with basis e1, . . . , em where deg(ei) = fi, for each i = 1, . . . , m, with

f1 ≤ · · · ≤ fm, we denote by CornM (Ijej) the set of corners of Ijej that are also corners

of M , i.e., CornM (Ijej) = Corn(Ijej) ∩ Corn(M ).

Morever, if D(M ) is the set of the ideals appearing in the direct decomposition of M ,

we deﬁne the following set of ideals of S:

Corn(D(M )) = {Ij ∈ D(M ) : CornM (Ijej) 6= ∅, for j = 1, . . . , m};

we call each ideal of Corn(D(M )) a corner ideal of M .

Deﬁnition 4.1 Let (k1, . . . , kr) and (ℓ1, . . . , ℓr) be two sequences of positive integers such

that n − 1 ≥ k1 > k2 > · · · > kr ≥ 1 and 1 ≤ ℓ1 < ℓ2 < · · · < ℓr. The set C =

{(k1, ℓ1), . . . , (kr, ℓr)} is called a corner sequence and ℓ1, . . . , ℓr are called the corner degrees

of C.

Remark 4.2 Deﬁnition 4.1 is motivated by the fact that for every ﬁnitely generated

graded S-module M , Corn(M ) deﬁnes a corner sequence.

Deﬁnition 4.3 A totally ordered corner sequence C = {(k1, ℓ1), . . . , (kr, ℓr)} is a corner

sequence such that (k1, ℓ1) ≻ (k2, ℓ2) ≻ · · · ≻ (kr, ℓr) where

(ki, ℓi) ≻ (kj , ℓj)

if and only if ki ≥ kj

and

ℓi ≤ ℓj;

11

we refer to (ki, ℓi) as the i-th element of the ordered corner sequence.

Let M = ⊕m

j=1Ijej be a monomial submodule of F . One can observe that if (k, ℓ) ∈

Corn(M ) and βk,k+ℓ−fj (Ij) 6= 0, then (k, ℓ) ∈ CornM (Ijej). Hence, we deﬁne the following

m-tuple of non–negative integers:

C(k,ℓ) = (βk,k+ℓ−f1(I1), . . . , βk,k+ℓ−fm(Im));

we call such a sequence the (k, ℓ)-sequence of the module M . It is clear that βk,k+ℓ(M ) =

Pm

j=1 βk,k+ℓ−fj (Ij).
Hence, if Corn(M ) = {(k1, ℓ1), . . . , (kr, ℓr)} is a totally ordered corner sequence, one

can associate to the module M an r × m matrix whose i-th row is the (ki, ℓi)-sequence

of M , 1 ≤ i ≤ r. We call such a matrix the corner matrix of M , and we denote it by

CM . The sum of the entries of the i–th row of CM equals the value of the extremal Betti

number βki,ki+ℓi(M ), for i = 1, . . . , r.

Example 4.4 Let S = K[x1, . . . , x6]. Consider the strongly stable submodule M = I1e1⊕
I2e2 ⊕ I3e3 ⊕ I4e4 ( S3, where I1 = (x2
I2 = (x2
1x2, x2
2x4, x2x2

one has that Corn(M ) = {(5, 2), (3, 3), (2, 5)}, Corn(I1e1) = CornM (I1e1) = Corn(M ),

2x4, x2x4
2, x2

2x3,

Corn(I2e2) = {(2, 2)}, CornM (I2e2) = ∅, Corn(I3e3) = CornM (I3e3) = {(3, 3)}, Corn(I4e4)

= {(4, 2), (3, 3)}, CornM (I4e4) = {(3, 3)}. Moreover, β5,5+2(I1e1) = β3,3+3(I1e1) =

β2,2+5(I1e1) = 1, β3,3+3(I3e3) = 1, β3,3+3(I4e4) = 3 and β5,5+2(M ) = 1, β3,3+3(M ) = 5,

β2,2+5(M ) = 1.

Hence, C(5,2) = (1, 0, 0, 0), C(3,3) = (1, 0, 1, 3), C(2,5) = (1, 0, 0, 0), and

CM =




1 0 0 0

1 0 1 3

1 0 0 0



.

Note that the sum of the entries of each row of CM gives the value of the extremal Betti

numbers β5,5+2(M ), β3,3+3(M ) and β2,2+5(M ), respectively. Furthermore, Corn(D(M )) =

{I1, I3, I4}.

12

From now on, we deal with submodules of the ﬁnitely generated graded free S–module

Sm, m ≥ 1, with standard basis e1, . . . , em, where deg(ei) = 0, for all i. Moreover, in
j=1Ijej is a monomial submodule of Sm, we

order to simplify the notations, if M = ⊕m

write CornM (Ijej) = CornM (Ij) and Corn(Ijej) = Corn(Ij).

Lemma 4.5 Let M = ⊕m

j=1Ijej be a strongly stable submodule of Sm, m ≥ 1, with
extremal Betti numbers βk1,k1+ℓ1(M ) = a1, . . ., βkr ,kr+ℓr (M ) = ar, 1 ≤ r ≤ n − 1. Then

there exists a strongly stable submodule fM of Sm such that
(i) Corn(fM ) = Corn(M );
(ii) βki,ki+ℓi(fM ) = ai, for i = 1, . . . , r;
(iii) Corn(I) = Corn fM (I), for any I ∈ Corn(D(fM )).

Proof. Let (ki, ℓi) be a corner of M and let C(ki,ℓi) = (βki,ki+ℓi(I1), . . . , βki,ki+ℓi(Im)) be

the (ki, ℓi)-sequence of M , for i = 1, . . . , r. Setting βki,ki+ℓi(Ij) = ai,j, j = 1, . . . , m, one

j=1 ai,j, for i = 1, . . . , r. Consider the corner matrix of M :

(4.1)

Setting

Ch = {(ki, ℓi) : ai,h 6= 0, for i = 1, . . . , r} (1 ≤ h ≤ m),

let Ih ∈ Corn(D(M )) be the strongly stable ideal of S such that CornM (Ih) = Ch. One

has that βki,ki+ℓi(Ih) = ai,h, for i = 1, . . . , r.

Now we prove that there exists a strongly stable ideal eIh (1 ≤ h ≤ m) of S such that
Corn(eIh) = Ch and βki,ki+ℓi(eIh) = ai,h, for i = 1, . . . , r.

If Corn(Ih) = CornM (Ih), then Ih is the ideal we are looking for. Assume Ch ( Corn(Ih).

Thus, Ch is not a maximal corner sequence of Ih, and there exists at least one pair (k, ℓ) of

positive integers which is a corner of Ih, but not of M . Hence, because of |Ch| < |Corn(Ih)|,

we are able to construct a strongly stable ideal eIh of S generated in the corner degrees

of Ch, with Corn(eIh) = Ch and such that βki,ki+ℓi(eIh) = ai,h, using the same criterion in
Finally, the strongly stable submodule fM of Sm obtained from M , replacing every
ideal Ih ∈ Corn(D(M )) with the ideal eIh, and leaving unchanged the ideals Ij ∈ D(M ) \

Corn(D(M )), is the desired strongly stable submodule of Sm. ✷

Now we are in position to give the main result of the paper.

Theorem 4.6 Given two positive integers n, r such that 1 ≤ r ≤ n − 1, r pairs of positive

integers (k1, ℓ1), . . . , (kr, ℓr) with n − 1 ≥ k1 > k2 > · · · > kr ≥ 1 and 2 ≤ ℓ1 < ℓ2 < · · · <

ℓr, and a1, . . . , ar positive integers. Set C = {(k1, ℓ1), . . . , (kr, ℓr)}. Then there exists a

strongly stable submodule M of Sm, m ≥ 1, with extremal Betti numbers βki,ki+ℓi(M ) = ai,

for i = 1, . . . , r, if and only if

(1) for m = 1, k1 +1 = n, whenever r = n−2, ℓ1 = 2 and kr ≥ 2, or whenever r = n−1,

monomials of degree ℓi (degree ℓj, respectively) deﬁned in the statements of

Proposition 3.4 and Theorem 3.7.

Proof. For m = 1, the assertions (1)–(3) follow from Propositions 3.2, 3.4, Theorem 3.7

and Remarks 2.4, 3.6. Assume m > 1. Let M = ⊕m

j=1Ijej be a strongly stable submodule
of Sm with extremal Betti numbers βki,ki+ℓi(M ) = ai, for i = 1, . . . , r. Condition (2)

follows from Remark 2.4. Furthermore, one can observe that βki,ki+ℓi(M ) equals the value

ℓi−1 (cid:1) if the corner (ki, ℓi) is determined by every ideal Ij ∈ D(M ) and βki,ki+ℓi(Ij) =
m(cid:0)ki+ℓi−1
ℓi−1 (cid:1), for each j. Let (ki, ℓi) ∈ Corn(M ) and consider the (ki, ℓi)-sequence C(ki,ℓi) of
(cid:0)ki+ℓi−1
M , i = 1, . . . , r. Setting C(ki,ℓi) = (ai,1, ai,2, . . . , ai,m), one has ai = Pm

h=1 ai,h. The non-
zero components of C(ki,ℓi) are determined by the corner ideals Ij of M , 1 ≤ j ≤ m, such

that (ki, ℓi) ∈ CornM (Ij). From Lemma 4.5, we may assume that CornM (Ij) = Corn(Ij).

If Ih is such an ideal, then βki,ki+ℓi(Ih) = ai,h. We distinguish two cases: |CornM (Ih)| = 1

and |CornM (Ih)| > 1.

(Case 1.) Let |CornM (Ih)| = 1. Then Condition (3),(ii.1) follows from Remark 2.4.

(Case 2.) Let |CornM (Ih)| > 1. If (kj , ℓj), with 1 ≤ j ≤ i − 1, is the smallest element

of CornM (Ih) (with respect to ≻) such that (kj, ℓj) ≻ (ki, ℓi), then Condition (3), (ii.2)

follows from Theorem 3.7 and Proposition 3.4.

Conversely, let a1, . . . , ar be positive integers satisfying Conditions (2) and (3). First

of all note that Condition (1) assures the existence of a strongly stable ideal of S of initial

degree 2 (of initial degree ≥ 3, respectively) with n − 2 extremal Betti numbers (n − 1

extremal Betti numbers, respectively) in the given positions.

Consider the r × m matrix deﬁned in (4.2). Our purpose is to construct a strongly

stable submodule M of Sm such that CM = A.

Denote by col∗(A) the set consisting of the columns of the matrix A having at least

one non-zero entry. We distinguish two cases: |col∗(A)| = 1 and |col∗(A)| > 1.

(Case 1.) Let |col∗(A)| = 1. Consider the monomial submodule M = ⊕m

j=1Ijej of Sm

deﬁned as follows:

- G(Ij ) = L(xℓ1−1

1

, . . . , xℓ1−2

1

xkr+1), for j = 1, · · · , m − 1;

15

- Im is the strongly stable ideal of S generated in degrees ℓ1 < · · · < ℓr with extremal

Betti numbers βki,ki+ℓi(Im) = ai, for i = 1, . . . , r, and constructed according to the

criterion used in Propositions 3.4, 3.5 (see also [10, Theorem 3.1]) .

Since the ideals Ij, j = 1, . . . , m − 1, do not give any contribution to the computation of

the extremal Betti numbers of M (Characterization 2.3), it is clear that with these choices

M is a strongly stable submodule of Sm with extremal Betti numbers βki,ki+ℓi(M ) = ai,

for i = 1, . . . , r.

(Case 2.) Let |col∗(A)| > 1. We distinguish two subcases: |col∗(A)| = m; |col∗(A)| < m.

(Subcase 2.1) Suppose |col∗(A)| = m. Let colh(A) = (a1,h, a2,h, . . . , ar,h) be the h-th

column of A, 1 ≤ h ≤ m, and set

Ch = {(ki, ℓi) : ai,h 6= 0, for i = 1, . . . , r}.

One can observe that Condition (3),(ii) assures the existence of a strongly stable ideal

Ih ( S, for each h = 1, . . . , m, such that:

- Corn(Ih) = Ch;

- Ih is generated in the corner degrees of Ch;

- βki,ki+ℓi(Ih) = ai,h, for i = 1, . . . , r.

Indeed, because of the behavior of the integers ai,h, such an ideal can be obtained by using

the same criterion as in Proposition 3.4 (see also Proposition 3.5 and [10, Theorem 3.1]).

Hence, M = ⊕m

h=1Iheh is the desired strongly stable submodule of Sm.

(Subcase 2.2) Let |col∗(A)| = q < m. With the same notations as in (Subcase 2.1),

let col∗(A) = {colh1(A), . . . , colhq (A), 1 ≤ h1 < · · · < hq ≤ m}. Setting colhp(A) =

(a1,hp, a2,hp, . . . , ar,hp) and Chp = {(ki, ℓi) : ai,hp 6= 0, for i = 1, . . . , r}, for p = 1, . . . , q,

let Ihp be the strongly stable ideal of S generated in the corner degrees of Chp such that

Corn(Ihp) = Chp and βki,ki+ℓi(Ihp) = ai,hp, for i = 1, . . . , r. Consider the monomial
submodule M = M1 ⊕ M2 of Sm deﬁned as follows:

- M1 = ⊕m−q

j=1 Ijej ( Sm−q, with G(Ij) = L(xℓ1−1

1

xkr+1), for j = 1, . . . , m −

q;

16

- M2 = ⊕q

p=1Ihpem−q+p ( Sq.

Due to the structure of M1 and M2, one has that M is a strongly stable submodule of Sm

with CM = A. Note that M1 does not give any contribution to the computation of the

extremal Betti numbers of M . ✷

The next example illustrates the above theorem.

Example 4.7 Let C = {(5, 2), (3, 3), (2, 5)} be a corner sequence and consider the follow-

ing three positive integers:

a1 = 3,

a2 = 7,

a3 = 4.

Let S = K[x1, . . . , x6]. Set k1 = 5, k2 = 3, k3 = 2 and ℓ1 = 2, ℓ2 = 3, ℓ3 = 5. We

want to construct a strongly stable submodule M ( S3 with C(M ) = C and such that

βk1,k1+ℓ1(M ) = a1, βk2,k2+ℓ2(M ) = a2, βk3,k3+ℓ3(M ) = a3.

An admissible choice for the sequences of non-negative integers (ai,1, ai,2, ai,3) (i =

1, 2, 3) such that ai,1 + ai,2 + ai,3 = ai is the following one:

(1, 0, 2),

(3, 4, 0),

(1, 2, 1).

(4.3)

Either the choice for the integers ai, or the choice for the triplets (ai,1, ai,2, ai,3) (i = 1, 2, 3),

are forced by Remark 2.4 together with Propositions 3.4, 3.5 and [10, Theorem 3.1].

Indeed, if one considers the pairs (5, 2), (3, 3), (2, 5), then there exists a strongly stable

ideal I of S with extremal Betti numbers β5,5+2(I) = b1, β3,3+3(I) = b2, β2,2+5(I) = b3,

if and only if 1 ≤ b1 ≤ |A1 \ LexShad(A0)|, 1 ≤ b2 ≤ |A2 \ LexShad(A1)| and 1 ≤
b3 ≤ |A3 \ LexShad2(A2)| (Proposition 3.5), where A1 = {u ∈ A(5, 2) : u ≥ x1x6},
A2 = {u ∈ A(3, 3) : u ≥ x2x2

4}, and A3 = {u ∈ A(2, 5) : u ≥ x5

3}.

If one considers

the pairs (3, 3), (2, 5), then there exists a strongly stable ideal I of S with extremal Betti

numbers β3,3+3(I) = c1, β2,2+5(I) = c2, if and only if 1 ≤ c1 ≤ |A1 \ LexShad(A0)| and
1 ≤ c2 ≤ |A2 \ LexShad2(A1)| ([10, Theorem 3.1]), where A1 = {u ∈ A(3, 3) : u ≥ x2x2
and A2 = {u ∈ A(2, 5) : u ≥ x5

3}. Finally, if one considers the pairs (5, 2), (2, 5), then

4},

there exists a strongly stable ideal I of S with extremal Betti numbers β5,5+2(I) = d1,
β2,2+5(I) = d2, if and only if 1 ≤ d1 ≤ |A1\LexShad(A0)| and 1 ≤ d2 ≤ |A2\LexShad3(A1)|

(Proposition 3.4), where A1 = {u ∈ A(5, 2) : u ≥ x2x6}, and A2 = {u ∈ A(2, 5) : u ≥

From Proposition 3.5, there exists a strongly stable ideal I1 ( S (associated to col1(A))

such that Corn(I1) = C, βk1,k1+ℓ1(I1) = 1, βk2,k2+ℓ2(I1) = 3, βk3,k3+ℓ3(I1) = 1; from [10,

Theorem 3.1], there exists a strongly stable ideal I2 ( S (associated to col2(A)) such that

Corn(I2) = {(3, 3), (2, 5)}, βk2,k2+ℓ2(I2) = 4, βk3,k3+ℓ3(I2) = 2 and from Proposition 3.4,

there exists a strongly stable ideal I3 ( S (associated to col3(A)) such that Corn(I3) =
