Abstract. The Hα surface brightness – radius (SHα–r) relation is a robust distance indicator
for planetary nebulae (PNe), further enhanced by diﬀerent populations of PNe having distinct
loci in SHα–r space. Other types of photoionized nebulae also plot in quite distinct regions in
the SHα–r plane, allowing its use as a diagnostic tool. In particular, the nova shells and massive
star ejecta (MSE) plot on relatively tight loci illustrating their evolutionary sequences. For the
MSE, there is potential to develop a distance indicator for these objects, based on their trend
in SHα–r space. As high-resolution, narrowband surveys of the nearest galaxies become more
commonplace, the SHα–r plane is a potentially useful diagnostic tool to help identify the various
ionized nebulae in these systems.

1. Introduction
This paper explores the potential of the SHα–r plane as a diagnostic tool for the study of
photoionized emission nebulae. As part of our work on determining distances for Galactic
planetary nebulae (PNe), we developed and calibrated the Hα surface brightness – radius (SHα–
r) relation [1], which has been shown to be more accurate than previous statistical distance
methods, particularly for the demographically common ‘senile’ PNe. Its application requires an
angular size, an integrated Hα ﬂux, and the reddening to the PN. From these quantities, an
intrinsic radius is calculated, which when combined with the angular size, yields the distance
directly. Rather than using the radio domain, we chose the Hα emission-line, ﬁrstly as it best
represents the nebular ionized mass, and secondly because a number of narrowband Hα imaging
surveys have recently become available [2][3][4][5], from which accurate integrated ﬂuxes and/or
diameters can be determined [6][7][8]. Ongoing Hα surveys [9] will continue to be useful, as part
of our ongoing eﬀorts to characterize the entire Galactic PN population [10].

2. The Hα relation for planetary nebulae
In [1] we described in detail the construction of a catalogue of Hα ﬂuxes, angular diameters,
and distances for both Galactic and extra-galactic PNe, to be used as primary calibrators for
the SHα–r relation. This relation was reﬁned from earlier versions [11][12][13][14][15] published
previously, based on continued improvement in the input data, with consequent reduction of
the uncertainties. A range of criteria to further improve the precision of the SHα–r relation
were investigated by [15], with [1] eventually separating PNe into two broad groups based on
spectroscopic criteria. Optically thick PNe (with strong [O ii] and [N ii] lines) are systematically

more massive than the optically-thin PNe that fall along the lower part of the PN locus. Using
sub-trends has allowed more precision in determining distances, as good as 18 per cent in the
case of optically-thin PNe. Recently, [16] analysed the commonly-used SSV distance scale [17]
in some depth. In particular, this scale has a substantial scale error at large PN radii, meaning
that the distances for evolved (demographically-common) PNe are considerably underestimated,
by a factor of two-or-so. Our revised scale [1] is largely free of this problem, having improved
on the mean SHα–r relation of [15], which in turn had been independently validated [16][18][19]
as the most reliable statistical distance scale to date. We expect our distances to remain useful
even after the expected data avalanche from the Gaia satellite [21], as many PN central stars
are fainter than the Gaia magnitude limit, or have confusion problems in compact PNe of high
surface brightness [22]. Of course the Gaia parallaxes will allow the reﬁnement of our proposed
sub-trends in the S–r plane, enhancing its ability both as a diagnostic tool, and as a robust
measure for the many PNe without trigonometric distances.

3. Other Emission Nebulae
Besides the PNe discussed in [1], we are also interested in the ability of the SHα–r diagram to
discriminate between bona ﬁde PNe, transitional objects, and the zoo of PN-like nebulae and
outright mimics (see Fig. 1) that have been confused with them [23][24], both in the Milky Way
and in the nearest galaxies. It is well known that some bipolar PNe have similar morphologies
to the outﬂows around D-type symbiotic stars (SyS), and their similarities and diﬀerences have
been discussed several times in the literature, e.g. [25][26][27][28]. To investigate these nebulae,
we have adopted Hα ﬂuxes from the literature, supplemented with our own data [6][7][10], while
distances have been taken from the sources given in [1], supplemented with a few distances from
[20]. Note that the locations of the SyS nebulae in the SHα–r plot are only indicative, as their
ﬂuxes and dimensions are diﬃcult to measure precisely. For the ejecta around luminous blue
variable (LBV) and Wolf-Rayet stars [29][30], we adopt the data directly from [1], as we do for
the low-mass H ii regions in the ISM. We also plot a range of nova shells where we utilize the
rather heterogeneous data compiled by [31][32][33]. Finally, we add the faint bipolar nebula
surrounding CK Vul [34][35], the bowshock nebulae around the nova-like cataclysmic variables
(CVs) BZ Cam [36][37] and V341 Ara [15][38], as well as the peculiar object Te 11 [39][40].

4. Discussion
In Fig. 2, we plot a range of diﬀerent photoionized nebulae in SHα–r space. Besides the primary
PN locus, some transitional PNe and miscellaneous PN-like objects described in [1] are also
plotted. Particularly interesting are the locations of the core and lobes of the outﬂow KjPn8
[41], showing the large range in ejecta mass between outﬂow episodes. The massive star ejecta

Figure 2. PNe and mimics plotted in the SHα–r plane. Transitional PNe (tPN), miscellaneous objects
(Misc), massive star ejecta (MSE), low-mass H ii regions in the ISM, symbiotic (SyS) outﬂows, nova shells
(NS), and CV nebulae have been plotted separately. Individual objects discussed in the text are labelled.

(MSE) generally plot above the PNe, reﬂecting their larger ionized masses in the mean. For the
MSE, a reasonably tight evolutionary trend is seen, if we exclude the young, low-mass outﬂow
around the historical LBV, P Cygni. The points can be ﬁt by a relation with a slope of −2.3,
markedly shallower than the PN locus, indicating the substantial amount of circumstellar and/or
interstellar material being swept up in the evolved MSE. The data suggest an approximate
distance scale can be developed for ejecta around LBVs and WN stars, at least for those shells
that are not dominated by snow-plowed interstellar matter.

The nova shells, as expected, show a steep relation (power law slope ≃ −5) at young ages
due to adiabatic expansion, before the trend ﬂattens at larger radii as additional circumstellar
material is swept up. The unusual (massive) shells around GK Per and T Pyx [42][43][44] are
seen to be above the mean shell trend. Note there is at least one PN hosting a classical nova
[45], as well a very faint bipolar nebula [43][46] surrounding the nova ejecta from GK Per, with
properties similar to a low-mass PN [1]. The CV bowshock nebulae (EGB 4 and Fr 2-11) are
clearly seen to be of lower ionized mass than PNe, though apparently distinct to classical nova
shells. Te 11 has aﬃnities with these nebulae, based on its nebular abundances and very low
expansion velocity; while it plots close to the ordinary nova shells, its distinct morphology (i.e.
a high volume ﬁlling factor) suggests a greater ionized mass and diﬀerent origin, cf. [40]. The
bipolar nebula around CK Vul is seen to have a mass comparable to a nova shell, but its origin
remains uncertain [35]. As shown in [1] the diﬀuse H ii regions in the ISM ionized by low-mass
stars are generally of low to very-low surface brightness and plot on and around the PN locus at
medium to large radii. What is somewhat unexpected is the substantial overlap in phase space
between the symbiotic outﬂows and PNe, with some evolved SyS nebulae being as massive as
typical PNe. Along with the emission-line diagnostic diagrams we have developed [23][47][48],
the SHα–r plane will also be a useful adjunct to help identify ionized nebulae in and beyond the
Milky Way, particularly with the advent of deep hydrogen-line surveys using the next generation

of telescopes. A more detailed discussion will be published elsewhere.
