The strength of CP violation in an accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiment

Introduction

In the past two decades we have witnessed a booming period in neutrino physics thanks to

a number of indisputable observations of atmospheric, solar, reactor and accelerator neutrino

oscillations [1], and thus achieved a smoking gun for the incompleteness of the standard

model (SM) in particle physics — the neutrinos actually have ﬁnite rest masses and the

lepton ﬂavors are signiﬁcantly mixed, motivating us to explore the other unknowns of massive

neutrinos beyond the SM and search for their possible consequences in nuclear physics, particle

astrophysics and cosmology.

In the standard three-ﬂavor scheme there are six neutrino oscillation parameters: two
3 − m2
independent neutrino mass-squared diﬀerences (e.g., ∆21 ≡ m2
1),
three lepton ﬂavor mixing angles (i.e., θ12, θ13 and θ23) and one CP-violating phase (i.e., δ).
Among them, the sign of ∆31 and the size of δ remain unknown [2, 3, 4]. But some preliminary
hints for δ ∼ 3π/2 and ∆31 > 0 have recently been seen by combining the T2K [5, 6] and NOνA
[7] data on νµ → νe oscillations with the Daya Bay (reactor νe → ν e oscillation [8, 9]) and
Super-Kamiokande (atmospheric νµ → νµ oscillation [10]) data. Provided δ is really around
3π/2 or takes a nontrivial value far away from 0 and π, then remarkable CP- and T-violating

eﬀects will emerge in some upcoming long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments.

The strength of CP and T violation in neutrino oscillations is measured by a universal and
rephasing-invariant quantity of the 3 × 3 Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) lepton
ﬂavor mixing matrix U [11, 12, 13], the so-called Jarlskog parameter J [14] deﬁned via

where the Greek and Latin subscripts run over (e, µ, τ ) and (1, 2, 3), respectively. When a

neutrino beam travels through a medium, it can see two kinds of refractive indices because

of its interactions with the constituents of the medium (i.e., electrons, protons and neutrons)

via the weak neutral current (NC) and charged current (CC) [15, 16]. All the three neutrino

ﬂavors share a common “matter” phase due to the refractive index arising from the NC

forward scattering, but the electron neutrinos develop an extra “matter” phase owing to the

CC forward scattering. The latter is nontrivial, and hence it is likely to change the neutrino

oscillation behavior. In this case one may deﬁne the matter-corrected neutrino masses emi and
the corresponding PMNS matrix eU , so as to express the probabilities of neutrino oscillations

in matter in the same way as those in vacuum. For example, the T-violating asymmetry
between the probabilities of νµ → νe and νe → νµ oscillations in matter is given by [17, 18] 1

1Since an ordinary medium (e.g., the Earth) only consists of electrons, protons and neutrons instead of both
these particles and their antiparticles, the matter background is not symmetric under the CP transformation.
Hence the expression of the CP-violating asymmetry between P (νµ → νe) and P (ν µ → νe) is not so simple

as that of eAT in Eq. (2), as one can clearly see in section 4.

may help one choose the proper neutrino beam energies and baseline lengths when designing

an accelerator-based oscillation experiment which is capable of measuring the leptonic CP-

violating eﬀects and determining the fundamental phase parameter δ.

One purpose of the present work is to reveal a unique range of the neutrino beam energy

E in which the size of the eﬀective Jarlskog invariant eJ can be enhanced as compared with
its fundamental counterpart J . We ﬁnd that eJ /J & 1 will hold if E is below the upper

which is roughly 110% (or 107%) for ∆31 > 0 (or ∆31 < 0). As for an antineutrino beam,

however, eJ /J decreases monotonically in the E . 1 GeV region and thus does not undergo

any resonance. Hence it makes sense to consider the possibility of a medium-baseline neutrino
oscillation experiment with the beam energy E being in the range E∗ . E . 2E∗, which is
capable of exploring leptonic CP violation with little matter-induced suppression 2.

In the second part of this work (i.e., section 3) we concentrate on a geometrical description

of leptonic CP violation in matter and make some analytical approximations for this intuitive

and useful language. Namely, we show how the three Dirac unitarity triangles (UTs) in the
complex plane [23] 3, deﬁned through the orthogonality relations

2Note that Minakata and Nunokawa have discussed a similar possibility and obtained the leading-order
analytical result of E∗ in Ref. [22]. In comparison, our analytical result in Eq. (3) has a much higher degree of

accuracy and thus the new result in Eq. (4) can explain the sensitivity of eJ∗/J to the neutrino mass ordering.

3The other three unitarity triangles (deﬁned as △1, △2 and △3), the so-called Majorana UTs [24, 25],
will not be discussed here because they have nothing to do with leptonic CP and T violation in normal
neutrino-neutrino and antineutrino-antineutrino oscillations.

are modiﬁed (either enlarged or suppressed) by terrestrial matter eﬀects in a low-energy

medium-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment. We ﬁnd that the third side of each UT (i.e.,
Uµ3U ∗
µ3) is essentially insensitive to the matter-induced corrections when the
neutrino beam energy E is low, but the other two sides — both their sizes and orientations —

can get appreciable corrections. Besides some new and useful analytical results to be obtained

in a reasonably good approximation, a numerical illustration of the real shapes of the eﬀective

Dirac UTs in matter (denoted as e△e, e△µ and e△τ ) changing with E will also be presented.
In the third part of this work (i.e., section 4) we aim to combine our new results about eJ
and e△α (for α = e, µ, τ ) with the probabilities of neutrino oscillations in matter. In particular,
the eﬀective probabilities eP (νµ → νe) and eP (νµ → νe) are expanded in the E . 0.5 GeV

The latter means sin 2eθ23 sineδ = sin 2θ23 sin δ in the standard parametrization of U and eU .
4As far as we know, almost all the previous analytical approximations for eP (νµ → νe) and eP (ν µ → νe)

were made in the E & 0.5 GeV region (see, e.g., the well-known paper by Freund in Ref. [26]) to satisfy the
requirements for studying the long-baseline neutrino oscillations. The analytical approximations to be made

in the present work will cover the E . 0.5 GeV region, and thus they are expected to be useful for the study
of terrestrial matter eﬀects in a low-energy medium-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment.

above formulas remain valid but the replacements U → U ∗ and A → −A (i.e., J → −J

replacements, and thus their ratio remains positive.

parametrization simply because they have nothing to do with neutrino oscillations under discussion.

Although Eqs. (9)—(11) are exact, they are unable to reveal the dependence of e∆ij on ∆ij
in this connection, so as to simplify the relations between e∆ij and ∆ij. The remarkable
analytical approximations made by Freund [26] have been popularly applied to the studies
of various long- or medium-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments with E & 0.5 GeV 6.
Given the fact that 7.02 × 10−5 eV2 ≤ ∆21 ≤ 8.09 × 10−5 eV2 holds at the 3σ conﬁdence
level [4] and the dependence of terrestrial matter eﬀects on the neutrino beam energy E can
be eﬀectively expressed as A ≃ 2.28 × 10−4 eV2 (E/GeV) for a realistic ongoing or upcoming
neutrino oscillation experiment [34] 7, the limit E & 0.5 GeV is essentially equivalent to the
requirement |α| < |β|.

But we stress that the case of |α| & |β| is also interesting in neutrino phenomenology,
especially in the aspect of probing leptonic CP and T violation in a low-energy medium-

neutrino beam energy E is higher than about 0.5 GeV. To see this point, we calculate the

ratio of eJ to J by using Eqs. (7)—(11) and inputting the best-ﬁt values of ∆21, ∆31, θ12
change of eJ /J with E in Fig. 1, where both the neutrino (with A) and antineutrino (with

3 × 3 PMNS matrix U is directly or indirectly violated in the presence of light or heavy sterile neutrinos, the
similar analytical expansions of neutrino oscillation probabilities have been done by Li and Luo [33].

transparent way. Fig. 2 is a clearer illustration of this peak, where the 3σ ranges of ∆21,

oscillation parameters are measured to a much higher degree of accuracy in the near future. In

the low-energy region under consideration the magnitude of β is comparable with or smaller

than that of α, and thus both of them can serve for the small expansion parameters in our

analytical approximations for e∆21, e∆31 and e∆32. We ﬁrst consider the neutrino beam. A

tedious but straightforward calculation leads us to the results

say, one may use the analytical formulas given either in the present work or in Ref.

[26] to

do a phenomenological analysis of neutrino oscillations in the T2K experiment. It is expected

that our analytical approximations are valid for the whole E . 1 GeV region in studying the

low-energy medium-baseline neutrino oscillations with terrestrial matter eﬀects.

Given the resonance energy E∗ in Eq. (3) and the maximum value eJ∗/J in Eq. (4), the
proﬁles of eJ /J in the left and right panels of Fig. 2 can easily be understood. Simply be-
cause the next-to-leading-order terms of E∗ and eJ∗/J are both proportional to the expansion

parameter α = ∆21/∆31 ≃ ±1/30, they exhibit a small but appreciable diﬀerence in Fig. 2
with respect to the normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchies. This observation indicates

11

that even a low-energy neutrino oscillation experiment has the potential to probe not only

the CP- and T-violating eﬀects but also the neutrino mass ordering.

At this point it is worth stressing that the matter-induced ampliﬁcation or enhancement

correction. It is well known that θ13, θ23 and δ are all insensitive to terrestrial matter eﬀects

of eJ under discussion is actually associated with the sensitivity of θ12 to the matter-induced
(i.e., eθ13 ≃ θ13, eθ23 ≃ θ23 andeδ ≃ δ) in the E . 1 GeV region [18, 22, 35], and hence the ﬁrst

equality in Eq. (7) leads us to the relation

where Eq. (21) or (22) has been taken into account. So the behavior of the ratio of sin 2eθ12
to sin 2θ12 changing with E is expected to be the same as that of eJ /J shown in Fig. 2.
Last but not least, let us ﬁgure out the upper limit of E which allows eJ /J & 1 to hold.
For this purpose, we take eJ /J ≃ 1 in Eq. (21) or (22) and then solve this equation. Besides

the trivial solution E = 0, there is a nontrivial solution

cos 2θ13 ≃ 1), we are then left with E0 ≃ ∆21 cos 2θ12/(cid:0)√2 GFNe(cid:1) . 0.3 GeV by considering
A ≃ 2.28 × 10−4 eV2 (E/GeV) and inputting the best-ﬁt values of ∆21 and θ12 [4]. Given the
best-ﬁt values and 3σ ranges of ∆21, ∆31, θ12 and θ13 listed in Table 1, the more accurate
results of E0 can be obtained from solving eJ /J = 1 in Eq. (7) in a numerical way: E0 ≃ 0.284

GeV (best-ﬁt) and 0.214 GeV . E0 . 0.359 GeV (3σ range) for the normal neutrino mass
ordering, or E0 ≃ 0.244 GeV (best-ﬁt) and 0.179 GeV . E0 . 0.312 GeV (3σ range) for the
inverted neutrino mass ordering. These results are consistent with those shown in Fig. 2.

Since E0 ≃ 2E∗ holds as a good approximation, one should better set the neutrino beam
energy E in the E∗ . E . 2E∗ range when designing a realistic medium-baseline oscillation

experiment to probe the eJ /J & 1 region of CP violation (see section 4 for more discussions).

|J |/2 and |eJ |/2, respectively. Hence a change of the ratio eJ /J with the neutrino beam
exact analytical expressions of the three sides of e△α for a constant matter proﬁle have been

derived in Ref. [36]. Here we ﬁnd a more convenient way to reexpress the previous results 9,

where θ12 ≃ 33.48◦ has been taken as a typical input value to illustrate the deviation of each

at the resonance point β∗ ≃ α cos 2θ12 under discussion. In Fig. 4 we plot the three Dirac UTs
in the complex plane by inputting the best-ﬁt values of six neutrino oscillation parameters
and taking the resonant beam energy E∗ ≃ 0.140 GeV (or 0.123 GeV) for the normal (or

inverted) neutrino mass ordering, corresponding to the peak of eJ /J shown in Fig. 2. Now

the deformation of each UT becomes more intuitive, although the terrestrial matter eﬀects in

such a low-energy case are not very signiﬁcant. Two comments are in order.

(1) Fig. 4 is a reﬂection of the real shapes of the fundamental and eﬀective UTs based on
the best-ﬁt results of current neutrino oscillation data. The conﬁgurations of △µ (or △τ ) in
the cases of normal and inverted mass neutrino hierarchies look quite diﬀerent, simply because
e3 = s13eiδ (or its complex conjugate) but the best-ﬁt
one of its three sides is proportional to U ∗
value of the CP-violating phase δ lies in two diﬀerent quadrants in these two cases, as one
can see in Table 1. In comparison, the conﬁguration of △e is not so sensitive to the best-ﬁt

values of δ in the cases of normal and inverted mass hierarchies since its three sides do not
directly depend on Ue3 or equivalently s13e−iδ. As for the three eﬀective Dirac UTs in matter,
the same observations are true.

(2) Although the matter-induced corrections to the three fundamental UTs are not very

signiﬁcant, one can see a clear change in the orientations of two sides of each triangle at the
resonance energy E∗. Our numerical results in Fig. 4 conﬁrm the observations based on the
analytical approximations made below Eq. (37), implying that we have fully understood the

matter-corrected behaviors of leptonic CP and T violation in the low-energy region.

As a by-product, Figs. 5 and 6 show the matter-corrected Dirac UTs corresponding to the

realistic accelerator-based T2K [5] and NOνA [7] experiments which have the typical neutrino

beam energies 0.6 GeV and 2 GeV, respectively. In plotting these two ﬁgures we have input the

best-ﬁt values of six oscillation parameters and considered both the neutrino and antineutrino
beams. Note that a description of antineutrino oscillations in matter actually involve U ∗ and
−A, but here we plot the relevant eﬀective UTs deﬁned in Eq. (28) with −A instead of their
complex conjugate counterparts for an antineutrino beam so as to make a direct comparison

between the same set of triangles in the neutrino (Fig. 5 with A) and antineutrino (Fig. 6
with −A) cases 11. Some comments and discussions are in order.

one can expect from Fig. 1. To be speciﬁc, we obtain

may see the diﬀerence between the shapes or orientations of the same UT in the normal

and inverted neutrino mass hierarchy cases. Such a diﬀerence mainly originates from the

fact that the best-ﬁt values of δ lie in two diﬀerent quadrants in these two cases. When

comparing one UT with respect to a neutrino beam with its counterpart with respect to an

antineutrino beam (i.e., one UT in Fig. 5 and its counterpart in Fig. 6), we ﬁnd that the
changes associated with each triangle’s shapes and orientations corresponding to A ↔ −A are
appreciable and even signiﬁcant when E increases — this eﬀect is just the fake CP-violating
asymmetry induced by terrestrial matter between να → νβ and να → νβ oscillations. The
reason for this “asymmetry” is simply that the ordinary matter background is not symmetric

under the CP transformation.

(3) The nine inner angles of the three eﬀective Dirac UTs in matter can be deﬁned as

cyclic running over (e, µ, τ ) and (1, 2, 3), respectively. Taking the T2K and NOνA experiments

γk(cid:17)i [40], where the Greek and Latin subscripts keep their

φαi ≡ argh−(cid:16)eUβjeU ∗

γj(cid:17) /(cid:16)eUβkeU ∗

for example, we calculate these inner angles and list the numerical results in Table 2, where

the best-ﬁt values of six neutrino oscillation parameters shown in Table 1 have been input. It

is obvious that terrestrial matter eﬀects may signiﬁcantly change the inner angles of the UTs,

and therefore change their conﬁgurations and orientations.

4 Neutrino oscillations and CP violation

Now we turn to the possibility of measuring leptonic CP violation in neutrino oscillations in
βi| of

a low-energy or low-matter-density region. In practice the matter-corrected sides |eUαieU ∗
three Dirac UTs and their corresponding Jarlskog parameter eJ can be determined from a

variety of long- or medium-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments [38]. The probabilities of
να → νβ oscillations in matter are given by

with α 6= β and i 6= j 6= k, one may then express the appearance (β 6= α) probabilities of

where eFji ≡ e∆jiL/ (4E), and the Greek and Latin subscripts run over (e, µ, τ ) and (1, 2, 3),

respectively. Given the algebraic relationship

Of our particular interest are the νµ → νe and νµ → νe oscillations to probe leptonic CP

(47)

and the expression of eP (νµ → ν e) can be directly read oﬀ from Eq. (47) with the replacements

J → −J and A → −A.

To see an interplay between the fundamental physics and terrestrial matter eﬀects in the
probability of νµ → νe oscillations in a more transparent way, let us make an analytical

approximation for the expression of eP (νµ → νe) in Eq. (47) with the help of Eqs. (21), (22)

for the normal neutrino mass hierarchy (i.e., ∆31 > 0), where ǫ2 ≃ α2 − 2αβ cos 2θ12 + β 2 has
been used. Second, Eq. (18) leads us to

Since a realistic neutrino oscillation experiment is usually expected to satisfy F31 ∼ O(1) for

some proper values of L and E, the second term of eF31 or eF32 in Eq. (50) can be treated as

a perturbation contribution. In this case,

When the inverted mass hierarchy (i.e., ∆31 < 0) is concerned, the corresponding results can
be easily obtained from Eqs. (49)—(51) with the replacement ǫ → −ǫ. As for an antineutrino

beam, the expression of eP (ν µ → ν e) in the normal hierarchy case can be directly read oﬀ from

Eq. (49) with the replacements J → −J and A → −A. Note that A → −A is equivalent to
β → −β, implying a consequent change of ǫ. Substituting Eqs. (50) and (51) into Eq. (49)
for the neutrino beam and considering a similar situation for the antineutrino beam, we arrive

23

at the approximate analytical results of eP (νµ → νe) and eP (νµ → ν e) as follows:

therefore composed of two parts: eACP = eAF + eAJ , in which eAJ is the genuine CP-violating

These analytical results clearly show that the fake CP-violating asymmetry eAF is at the level
than the genuine CP-violating asymmetry eAJ in the low-energy region unless the latter is
12Note that eAJ as a CP-violating asymmetry is associated with both matter (A) and antimatter (−A),

as long as the magnitude of ǫ∓F31 is small. In this case sin(cid:0)ǫ∓F31(cid:1) ≃ ǫ∓F31 is a reasonably

Now it becomes more transparent that the fake CP-violating asymmetry eAF is proportional to
the matter parameter A, while the genuine CP-violating asymmetry eAJ in matter is essentially

equal to its counterpart in vacuum. While the result in Eq. (56) is well known [18, 22, 39] 13,
the one in Eq. (57) is absolutely new and instructive.

To illustrate the above observations in a numerical way, let us take two benchmark values

neutrino oscillation parameters have been input. These two benchmark beam energies are

of the neutrino beam energy E and plot the CP-violating asymmetries eAJ , eAF and eACP =
eAJ + eAF as functions of the baseline length L in Fig. 7, where the best-ﬁt values of six
just E∗ and E0 ≃ 2E∗, corresponding to the eJ∗/J peak and the nontrivial eJ /J = 1 point
as pointed out in section 2. One can see that eACP ≃ eAJ is an acceptable approximation in
the E ≃ E∗ case, and the deviation of eACP from eAJ can be appreciable when L becomes
larger simply because the matter-induced fake asymmetry eAF increases with L as implied

in Eq. (57). Although it is possible to obtain much larger CP-violating asymmetries when

the baseline length L is properly large, a price to pay for the growth of L is the decrease of
the neutrino ﬂux luminosity because the latter is proportional to L−2 [22]. For this reason,

associated with these two peaks are summarized in Table 3. Two comments are in order.

we focus on the ﬁrst two peaks of eACP in Fig. 7. The values of E, L, eACP and eAJ /eACP
(a) In the case of a normal neutrino mass hierarchy, eAJ /eACP < 1 holds on the peaks,
implying that the fake CP-violating asymmetry eAF contributes in a positive way.
trast, the contribution of eAF is negative for the inverted neutrino mass ordering, and hence
eAJ /eACP > 1 holds in this case.
(b) Given E ≃ E∗ for the ﬁrst peak of eACP, the corresponding baseline length L is about
of L is roughly doubled. The situation is similar for the second peak of eACP. Of course, a
realistic experiment should optimize both E and L to make eACP easily observable.
Furthermore, we plot the eﬀective probabilities eP (νµ → νe) and eP (νµ → νe) changing
13For example, it has been shown that the equality eJ sineF21 sineF31 sineF32 ≃ J sin F21 sin F31 sin F32 holds
to a good degree of accuracy provided the neutrino beam energy E and the baseline length L satisfy the
condition 10−7 (L/km)2 (GeV/E) ≪ 1 [39].

plotting Fig. 7. Since these two probabilities depend on ±A respectively, they receive diﬀerent
contributions from terrestrial matter eﬀects and thus their peaks correspond to diﬀerent values

of L. The diﬀerence between eP (νµ → νe) and eP (ν µ → ν e) is just the CP-violating asymmetry
eACP as illustrated in Fig. 7. Note that eACP and its two components are essentially insensitive

to the neutrino mass hierarchy in the leading-order approximation. This point can be clearly

seen in Eqs. (56) and (57). It implies that a reasonable determination of the CP-violating

eﬀect in the lepton sector (or equivalently, the size of δ) should be possible in a medium-
baseline neutrino oscillation experiment even before the sign of ∆31 is measured.

We hope that some of our results obtained in this work will be helpful for the design of a

low-energy oscillation experiment to explore leptonic CP violation. The proposed MuOn-decay

MEdium baseline NeuTrino beam facility (MOMENT) project [41] is just an experiment of this

type. The neutrino ﬂux of the MOMENT is expected to peak in the 0.15 GeV . E . 0.20 GeV
region, which happens to coincide with the E∗ . E . 2E∗ region recommended above. In
other words, this experiment is capable of probing the eﬀects of CP violation in νµ → νe
and νµ → νe oscillations with little matter-induced suppression. The present studies indicate
that the optimal baseline length of the MOMENT experiment should be around L ≃ 150 km
[41, 42], which is also within the expectation shown in Figs. 7 and 8. But the bottlenecks

to the physics reach of this experiment include how to achieve a suﬃciently intense neutrino

(or antineutrino) ﬂux and how to achieve a suﬃciently high suppression of the atmospheric

neutrino background, as pointed out and discussed in depth by Blennow et al in Ref. [42]. In

this connection we plan to carry out a further study of the feasibility and physics potential of

the MOMENT project elsewhere in collaboration with its team members [43].

In addition to the MOMENT facility, the ESSνSM project — a very intense neutrino super-

beam for the measurement of leptonic CP violation — has recently been proposed based on

the European Spallation Source Linac [44].

Its neutrino beam energy and baseline length

are expected to lie in the 0.2 GeV . E . 0.5 GeV range and the 300 km . L . 600 km

range, respectively.

It is obvious that the lower-energy and shorter-baseline part of this

parameter space is consistent with our recommendation about E and L made above.

In

fact, our analytical approximations are valid for the whole space of E and L of the ESSνSM

experiment, and hence they will be very helpful to understand the numerical analysis of this

experiment’s sensitivity to CP violation and matter contamination [45].

5 Summary

In this work we have explored leptonic CP violation in matter by considering a possible

low-energy medium-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment. Our primary motivation comes

from the following questions: (1) in which region of the neutrino beam energy E and to

The probabilities of νµ → νe and νµ → νe oscillations in matter, where the
benchmark beam energies E = 0.140 GeV (or 0.123 GeV) and E = 0.284 GeV (or 0.244

GeV) are taken for the normal (inverted) mass ordering, and the best-ﬁt values of neutrino

oscillation parameters [4] have been input.

what extent the matter-corrected Jarlskog parameter eJ can be enhanced in magnitude as

compared with the fundamental Jarlskog invariant J ; (2) in this connection how the Dirac
UTs △α (for α = e, µ, τ ) are deformed by terrestrial matter eﬀects; and (3) how the genuine
and fake CP-violating asymmetries between νµ → νe and νµ → ν e oscillations in matter
compete, and what ranges of the neutrino beam energy E and the baseline length L one

should choose to design such a realistic experiment. We have answered all these questions by

making analytical approximations for the expressions of eJ /J , the sides of the three eﬀective
Dirac UTs e△α (for α = e, µ, τ ), the eﬀective probabilities eP (νµ → νe) and eP (νµ → νe),
and the eﬀective CP-violating asymmetries eAJ , eAF and eACP = eAJ + eAF in terms of two

small expansion parameters α ≡ ∆21/∆31 and β ≡ A/∆31 in the E . 0.5 GeV region. Some
numerical examples to illustrate our analytical observations have also been presented by taking

28

into account both normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchies.

Although some attention has been paid to the possibility of a low-energy medium-baseline

neutrino oscillation experiment and its terrestrial matter eﬀects in the literature, our present

work has a number of new outcomes which are expected to be phenomenologically useful and

important. In particular,

is absolutely new. In this regard we have ﬁgured out both the resonance energy E∗ at

• our analytical expansion of the ratio eJ /J in terms of α and β in the low-energy region
which eJ /J peaks and the allowed range 0 ≤ E ≤ E0 ≃ 2E∗ in which eJ /J & 1 holds.

It is therefore possible for us to make the recommendation that a promising low-energy
neutrino oscillation experiment should be designed in the E∗ . E . 2E∗ region, so as
to probe leptonic CP violation with little matter-induced suppression.

• our analytical expansions of the sides of three eﬀective Dirac UTs in matter are com-
pletely new and instructive. This exercise makes the deformation of these triangles

as compared with their counterparts in vacuum very transparent. Since the sides of

leptonic UTs can be directly extracted from the diﬀerent terms of neutrino oscillation

probabilities, our analytical results have more or less strengthened the usefulness of the

UTs as a geometrical language in describing lepton ﬂavor mixing and CP violation.

• our analytical expansions of the eﬀective oscillation probabilities eP (νµ → νe) and
eP (νµ → νe) are also new in the E . 0.5 GeV region. They allow us to distinguish
oscillations in an analytically transparent way (namely, eAJ ∝ J and eAF ∝ A). One

between the genuine and fake CP-violating asymmetries between νµ → νe and νµ → νe

may then choose the proper baseline length L when designing a realistic low-energy

oscillation experiment to make the observation of leptonic CP violation more optimal.

Our analytical approximations are useful for a further study of the phenomenological

issues of the proposed MOMENT and ESSνSM experiments.

Moreover, we emphasize that the normal neutrino mass ordering was usually implied in the

previous analytical expressions of the eﬀective neutrino oscillation parameters in matter. In

this work we have taken into account both normal and inverted mass hierarchies and showed

their diﬀerences in the relevant analytical approximations.

Of course, more detailed works have to be done to combine our analytical results with

a given experiment, such as the MOMENT project, by considering both the neutrino beam

issues and the detector issues. We plan to focus on such important but complicated issues

elsewhere in collaboration with the MOMENT team [43].
