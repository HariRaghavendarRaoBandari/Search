ABSTRACT

Context. Some O and B stars show unusually strong or weak lines of carbon and/or nitrogen. These objects are classiﬁed as OBN or
OBC stars. It has recently been shown that nitrogen enrichment and carbon depletion are the most likely explanations for the existence
of the ON class.
Aims. We investigate OC stars (all being supergiants) to check that surface abundances are responsible for the observed anomalous
line strengths.
Methods.We perform a spectroscopic analysis of three OC supergiants using atmosphere models. A fourth star was previously studied
by us. Our sample thus comprises all OC stars known to date in the Galaxy. We determine the stellar parameters and He, C, N, and O
surface abundances.
Results. We show that all stars have eﬀective temperatures and surface gravities fully consistent with morphologically normal O
supergiants. However, OC stars show little, if any, nitrogen enrichment and carbon surface abundances consistent with the initial
composition. OC supergiants are thus barely chemically evolved, unlike morphologically normal O supergiants.

Key words. Stars: early-type – Stars: atmospheres – Stars: fundamental parameters – Stars: abundances

1. Introduction

Some OB stars show lines of carbon and nitrogen with unusual
morphologies. Jaschek & Jaschek (1967) were the ﬁrst to report
very weak nitrogen optical lines in two supergiants. Subsequent
observations of OB stars revealed a number of objects that had
similar spectral properties and also showed strong carbon lines
(Walborn 1970; Jaschek & Jaschek 1974). Some OB stars dis-
played strong nitrogen lines and weak carbon lines, too. Walborn
(1971) introduced the spectral types OBN and OBC, by anal-
ogy with Wolf-Rayet stars where similar line characteristics are
seen (see also Walborn 1976). The number of OBN/OBC stars is
small: according to the summary of Walborn et al. (2011), only
thirteen (four) Galactic O stars have an ON (OC) spectral type.
In Wolf-Rayet stars, the strength of carbon and nitrogen
lines is related to their evolutionary status. Winds have removed
the external layers and exposed inner regions where H and He
burning products are present. Walborn (1976) lists the possi-
ble mechanisms explaining the appearance of OBN/OBC stars.
Chemical enrichment/depletion is a plausible explanation. Re-
cently, Martins et al. (2015b) have quantitatively studied the sur-

face abundances of ON stars 1. They concluded that strong ni-
trogen enrichment and carbon depletion was the reason for their
spectral morphology. The physical origin of this chemical pat-
tern remains unclear though.

In this follow-up study, we focus on OC stars. Martins et al.
(2015a) analyzed a large sample of O stars including one OC
object (HD 152249). The latter turned out to show little nitro-
gen enrichment, unlike similar objects without the “C” qualiﬁer.
Here, we study the three additional OC stars of the sample of
Walborn et al. (2011).

2. Observations and sample

The spectroscopic data for HD 104565, HD152424, and
HD 154811 were obtained in the context of the OWN project
(Barbá et al. 2010, 2014) conducted at ESO/La Silla with the
FEROS instrument mounted on the 2.2m Max-Planck telescope
(Table 1). They have a resolving power of 48 000. They were re-
duced by the fully automated pipeline distributed by ESO. The
spectrum of HD 152249 was acquired with the ESPaDOnS spec-
tropolarimeter mounted on the Canada–France–Hawaii Tele-
scope. Its analysis was presented in Martins et al. (2015a), and
we adopt the parameters obtained in this study.

3. Modeling and spectroscopic analysis

We used the atmosphere code CMFGEN Hillier & Miller (1998)
to analyze the surface properties of the OC stars. The method we
used is the same as that presented in Martins et al. (2015b), and
we refer the reader to this paper for a full description. CMGFEN
computed non-LTE, spherically extended atmosphere models
that include line-blanketing. Synthetic spectra calculated from
the atmosphere models are compared to observations to deter-
mine the stellar parameters. The main parameters were obtained
as follows:
– Rotation and macroturbulence: we used the Fourier-
transform of O iii λ5592 to determine the projected equa-
torial rotational velocity V sini (Gray 1976). We then con-
volved a synthetic spectrum (with Teﬀ and log g estimated
from spectral type) with a radial–tangential proﬁle. The com-
parison of this synthetic spectrum with the observed proﬁle
yielded the macroturbulent velocity vmac.

– Eﬀective temperature: the ionization-balance method was
used to constrain Teﬀ, taking advantage of the numerous He i
and He ii lines present in the optical spectra. The ionization
balance of carbon (based on C iii lines and C ii 4267) is con-
sistent – within the error bars – with the eﬀective temperature
determined from helium lines.

– Surface gravity: log g was determined from the width of the
Balmer lines wings. Broader wings are observed for higher
surface gravities.

Once these parameters were constrained, we ran models with
diﬀerent surface abundances (for He, C, N, and O). For each star
and each element, a set of clean lines was selected from the ob-
served spectrum. These lines were quantitatively compared to
the synthetic spectra by means of a χ2 analysis from which we
derived the surface abundance and associated uncertainty (see
Martins et al. 2015a,b). Abundance determinations were per-
formed assuming a microturbulent velocity of 10 km s−1.

4. Results

The best ﬁts to the optical spectra of the target stars are pre-
sented in Appendix A. The stellar parameters and surface abun-
dances are summarized in Table 2. For all stars, we found that
He/H=0.1 led to good ﬁts (Figs. A.1 to A.3). Figure 1 shows the
log g – Teﬀ diagram with evolutionary tracks from Ekström et al.
(2012). We added the morphologically normal late-O super-
giants of Martins et al. (2015a) for comparison. All stars are lo-
cated at, or just beyond, the terminal age main sequence. They
are relatively clustered with initial masses between ∼20 and ∼40
M⊙. OC and normal O supergiants are located at the same posi-
tion of the diagram. As a result, OC stars do not have peculiar
eﬀective temperatures or surface gravities.

comparison late-type supergiants (O9-9.7I - open circles). Typical un-
certainties are shown in the upper-left corner. Evolutionary tracks from
Ekström et al. (2012) including rotation are overplotted, labeled by ini-
tial masses.

Figure 2 shows the ratio of nitrogen-to-carbon abundance
as a function of surface gravity. The evolutionary tracks of
Ekström et al. (2012) for the range of masses deduced from
Fig. 1 are overplotted. The diﬀerence between normal and OC
stars is striking. While normal O supergiants are accounted for
relatively well by the rotating-star evolutionary tracks, the OC
stars have N/C ratios lower by 0.6-0.8 dex (factor 4 to 6). In
fact, OC stars are almost consistent with no chemical processing
(N/C 0.0 to 0.3 dex higher than the initial value). Figure 3 shows
the position of the OC stars (and comparison supergiants) in the
log(N/C) - log(N/O) diagram. OC stars are fully consistent with
stars having experienced very little processing through the CN
or CNO cycles. Morphologically normal supergiants are more
chemically evolved.

5. Discussion

Figure 2 reveals that OC supergiants are much less chemically
evolved than morphologically normal O supergiants. They are
also less evolved than expected for stars of initial mass 20–
40 M⊙, assuming a standard initial rotational velocity of ∼300
km s−1. Indeed, the evolutionary tracks of Ekström et al. (2012)
with this initial rotation predict values of log(N/C) between 0.6
and 1.0, while OC supergiants have log(N/C) around -0.3. It is
conceivable that OC supergiants are the descendants of stars ro-
tating very slowly on the main sequence. In that case, single-
star evolution predicts that N/C should remain constant down to
log g ∼ 0.0, corresponding to the red supergiant phase. In Fig.
2, such an evolution would be represented by the dotted line. If
this explanation holds, OC supergiants would represent the de-
scendents of main-sequence stars at the low-velocity tail of the
initial rotational velocity distribution. Since the latter is continu-
ous (Ramírez-Agudelo et al. 2013), one would expect to ﬁnd O
supergiants with log(N/C) over the full range −0.3 − 1.0 in the

log(N/C) – log g diagram (Fig. 9 of Brott et al. 2011). In Fig. 2,
there seems to be a deﬁcit of stars for log(N/C) between -0.2 and
0.2 dex. However, the number of stars in this diagram remains
small. Interestingly, Hillier et al. (2003) studied a O7 supergiant
and a OC7.5 giant in the SMC. From the stellar properties and
surface abundances, they concluded that the latter was a slow
rotator that did not experience strong mixing.

If slow rotation is the explanation for the chemical appear-
ance of OC stars, their initial masses should be slightly higher
than those of morphologically normal O supergiants. Indeed,
evolutionary tracks without rotation are shifted to the right in
Fig. 1 compared to tracks including rotation. Consequently,
higher masses are needed to reproduce the position of OC stars
(40–60 M⊙ instead of 20–40 M⊙). OC stars may thus diﬀer from
morphologically normal stars in that respect.

Slow rotation does not explain all the properties of OC stars.
In particular, HD 154811 has a present-day rotational velocity
of 110 km s−1. This value is relatively large for O supergiant:

giants in the range 48–132 km s−1, with an average value of
88±30 km s−1. Given that the projected rotational velocity drops
signiﬁcantly when a star leaves the main sequence, one would
expect HD 154811 to have an initial V sini larger than 110
km s−1. For instance under the assumption of angular momen-
tum conservation and solid-body rotation, the ratio of initial to
present V sini is equal to the ratio of present to initial stellar ra-
dius. Assuming a factor of three for the latter ratio (according
to the tracks of Ekström et al. 2012), the initial rotational veloc-
itiy of HD 154811 would have been 330 km s−1, a fairly high
value. For the other targets, the initial projected rotational veloc-
ity would have been 120–160 km s−1.

The OBN/OBC classiﬁcation was introduced by analogy to
Wolf-Rayet stars (Walborn 1971). In WC stars, the appearance
of strong lines of carbon are caused by the large surface content
of carbon produced by helium burning. One could speculate that
the same is true for OC stars. However, in that case there should
be no hydrogen at the surface of the stars (Crowther 2007). In ad-
dition, helium should be the dominant element, which is clearly
not the case. As a result, the abundance patterns of OC stars are
not due to helium-burning products.

Surface abundances can be altered by mass transfer in binary
systems. Bolton & Rogers (1978) investigated binarity among
OC stars. Their results indicated a low binary fraction, although
results were not conclusive for some stars. Levato et al. (1988)
revisited this question and reached more robust conclusions: OC
stars usually do not show the radial velocity variations typical
of spectroscopic binaries. Sana et al. (2008) obtained time se-
ries spectroscopy of HD 152249 and did not detect any sign
of a companion. The interferometric search for companions
around O stars by Sana et al. (2014) conﬁrms that HD 152249,
HD 152424, and HD 154811 do not have bright companions.
The ongoing OWN spectroscopic survey of O stars conﬁrm these
results: only HD 152424 shows radial velocity variations greater
than 5 km s−1. HD 152424 may be a SB1 with a low mass com-
ponent (Barbá et al., in prep). All other OC stars are probably
single objects. Consequently, the chemical abundances of OC
stars are unlikely to be due to binary interaction. Besides, if mass
transfer can explain nitrogen enrichment and carbon depletion,
it cannot explain that surface abundances are almost unaltered.
This would have to be due to tidal interaction that would sup-
press internal mixing processes.

Interestingly, Bouret et al. (2008) report very little nitrogen
enrichment and almost solar carbon abundance in the star ζ Ori.
Sota et al. (2014) classify it as “Nwk”, meaning that the nitro-
gen lines are weak, as in OC stars. And ζ Ori is known to host
a weak magnetic ﬁeld (Bouret et al. 2008; Blazère et al. 2015),
which is quite diﬀerent from the strong dipoles usually observed
in magnetic O stars (e.g., Wade & MiMeS Collaboration 2015).
Martins et al. (2015a) showed that the chemical properties of
O stars with dipole ﬁelds did not signiﬁcantly diﬀer from stars
without magnetic ﬁelds. One may wonder whether for the case
of a weak, small scale magnetic ﬁeld, the situation is diﬀerent.
Meynet et al. (2011) show that massive stars with magnetic ﬁeld
of only a few Gauss may slow down very fast provided they are
in solid-body rotation. In that case, there is no time for signiﬁ-
cant mixing, and stars appear chemically unevolved (see Fig. 1
of Meynet et al. 2011). A deep spectrolarimetric study of OC
stars is needed to investigate the role of magnetism.

All OC stars in the Galaxy are late-type supergiants. Since
the OC phenomenon is due to surface abundances, one can un-
derstand that it is best seen in supergiants for which chemical
processing is already strong in morphologically normal stars.
The surface abundances of OC supergiants are similar to those
of O-normal dwarfs, probably because they are relatively chem-
ically unevolved. Thus, the diﬀerential eﬀect leading to the clas-
siﬁcation as OC (weak nitrogen lines/strong carbon lines) does
not exist among dwarfs that are only slightly chemically evolved
(Martins et al. (2015a). OC stars may be seen among giants
(Hillier et al. 2003). A recent study by Evans et al. (2015) as-
signs a spectral type OC to two early type O giants in the LMC,
based on the weakness of nitrogen lines.

Regarding spectral type, there is a priori no reason for the OC
phenomenon to be restricted to late-type O stars. Walborn et al.
(2010) introduced the “Ofc” classiﬁcation to characterize O stars
with C iii 4650 of the same strength as N iii 4640. These fea-
tures are seen in emission in Of stars, but the latter is usu-
ally stronger than the former. The distribution of Ofc stars is
peaked at spectral type O5. The strong C iii 4650 emission
may be due to a larger carbon content, as in OC stars. How-
ever, Martins & Hillier (2012) pointed out that the formation of
C iii 4650 in O-type stars depends on several physical param-
eters (winds, metallicity, microturbulence, atomic data). A de-
tailed analysis of Ofc stars using other carbon lines is therefore

necessary to check whether OC and Ofc stars belong to the same
class of chemically unevolved objects.

6. Conclusion

We performed a spectroscopic analysis of three OC supergiants
using atmosphere models (computed with the code CMFGEN)
and high-resolution optical spectroscopy. A fourth star was pre-
viously studied in Martins et al. (2015a). We determined the stel-
lar parameters and surface abundances. We compared their prop-
erties to that of morphologically normal O supergiants. OC su-
pergiants have stellar parameters that are fully consistent with
normal O supergiants. OC stars show little or no nitrogen enrich-
ment, as well as close-to-initial carbon and oxygen abundances.
OC supergiants are barely chemically evolved, unlike morpho-
logically normal O supergiants. Slow rotation may be an expla-
nation for these surface chemical patterns, although problems
remain.

Appendix A: Best ﬁts to the observed spectra

The ﬁts to the observed spectra are usually of very good qual-
ity. The C iii line complex around 4650 Å is not reproduced in
HD 104565 and HD 152424. As stressed by Martins & Hillier
(2012), this line complex depends on details of the model-
ing (metallicity, blanketing, microturbuence, winds, etc.) and
should not be taken into account for abundance determinations.
Si iv 4089–4116 is also not correctly reproduced by our models
in the same two objects. We stress that we did not try to achieve
a good ﬁt for these lines, which are often a problem for O stars.
A detailed study of their formation processes is needed to under-
stand the present discrepancies.
