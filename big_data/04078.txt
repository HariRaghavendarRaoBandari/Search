We explain how an unexpected algebraic structure, the division algebras, can be seen to underlie
a generation of quarks and leptons. From this new vantage point, electrons and quarks are simply
excitations from the neutrino, which formally plays the role of a vacuum state. Using the ladder
operators which exist within the system, we build a number operator in the usual way. It turns out
that this number operator, divided by 3, mirrors the behaviour of electric charge. As a result, we
see that electric charge is quantized because number operators can only take on integer values.

Finally, we show that a simple hermitian form, built from these ladder operators, results uniquely
in the nine generators of SU (3)c and U (1)em. This gives a direct route to the two unbroken gauge
symmetries of the standard model.

With the recent discovery of a scalar boson, whose
coupling, spin and parity properties appear to largely
align with the Higgs,
[1]-[4], there is little refuting
the predictive power of the standard model of particle
physics. However, amongst the standard model’s impres-
sive achievements are a number of gaps in our under-
standing. For one, the logic behind the particle content
of the standard model is still a mystery. Furthermore, the
phenomenon of electric charge quantization remains an
enigma, a property which is currently put into the theory
by hand. One would expect that if a deeper mathemati-
cal structure to the standard model could be found, then
it would act to illuminate the voids.

Here, we propose one such mathematical structure,
whose potential has largely gone unnoticed. This struc-
ture is the set of algebras known as the normed division
algebras over the reals. Strikingly, there exist only four
of these algebras: the real numbers, R, the complex num-
bers, C, the quaternions, H, and the octonions, O. It can
be shown that particle physics relies heavily on the ﬁrst
three of these algebras.

The real numbers are used almost universally in
physics; the complex numbers are central to quantum
theory; the quaternions lead to the Pauli matrices, and
are hence tightly entwined with the Lorentz algebra. In
fact, in [5] and [6], it is shown that the complex quater-
nions can concisely describe all of the Lorentz represen-
tations of the standard model:
scalars, spinors, four-
vectors, and the ﬁeld strength tensor, in terms of gen-
eralized ideals.

But what is to be said for the octonions, O, the fourth,
and ﬁnal division algebra? With R, C, and H each un-
deniably etched into fundamental physics, it is hard not
to wonder: is it really the case that O has been omitted
in nature?

In earlier years,

[7], G¨unaydin and G¨ursey showed
SU (3)c quark structure in the split octonions. Later, in
[8], they showed anti-commuting ladder operators within

that model. Our new results stem from the octonionic
chromodynamic quark model of [8], and are meant to re-
place the provisional charges of [6]. These ﬁndings make
a case in support of those who have been long advocating
for the existence of a connection between non-associative
algebras and particle physics, [5]-[22].

Using the algebra of the complex octonions, which we
will introduce, we expose an intrinsic structure to a gen-
eration of quarks and leptons. This algebraic structure
mimics familiar quantum systems, which have a vacuum
state acted upon by raising and lowering operators. In
this case, the neutrino poses as the vacuum state, and
electrons and quarks pose as the excited states.

With these raising and lowering operators in hand, we
are then able to construct a number operator in the usual
way,

N = X

i

α†i αi.

(1)

It will be seen that N has eigenvalues given by
{0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3}. At ﬁrst sight, these eigenvalues
might not look familiar, that is, until they are di-
vided by 3. N/3 has eigenvalues {0, 1
3 , 1},
which can now be recognized as the electric charges of
a neutrino (or anti-neutrino), a triplet of anti-down-type
quarks, a triplet of up-type quarks, and a positron. We
will then deﬁne our electric charge, Q, as

3 , 2

3 , 2

3 , 1

3 , 1

3 , 2

Q ≡

N
3

.

(2)

As N must take on integer values, Q must be quantized.
As we will show, the remaining states within a gen-
eration are related to these particles by complex conju-
gation, and hence are acted upon by −Q∗ in the usual
way.

Ours is certainly not the ﬁrst instance where G¨unaydin
and G¨ursey’s model has been adapted. As an extension
of their model, [17], [18], Dixon describes electric charge

as a mix of quaternionic and octonionic objects. It would
be interesting to see if a ladder system could be found,
which alternately gives Dixon’s Q as a number opera-
tor. Readers are encouraged to see [17], [18], or other
examples of his extensive work.

Since the time of ﬁrst writing, more octonionic chromo-
electrodynamic models have been found. Most notewor-
thy of all were three papers written in the late 1970s,
[10], [11] and [12], which could also be considered as ex-
tensions of G¨unaydin and G¨ursey’s model, [8]. In these
papers, the authors use two separate ladder systems: sys-
tem (a) ﬁts with the octonionic ladder operators of [8],
and system (b) is introduced as quaternionic. By com-
bining the two systems, they describe the electric charge
generator not as a number operator, but as the diﬀerence
between the number operators of the two systems. Ref-
erences [10], [11], and [12] are important papers, worth
careful reconsideration by the community.

Our results diﬀer from earlier versions in that we will
be constructing a generation of quarks and leptons explic-
itly as minimal left ideals of a Cliﬀord algebra, generated
by the complex octonions. In doing so, we will use just
a single octonionic ladder system, with its complex con-
jugate. This in turn allows us to deﬁne electric charge
more simply as Q = N/3, thereby exposing a more di-
rect route to the two unbroken gauge symmetries of the
standard model. Furthermore, our formalism naturally
relates particles and anti-particles using only the complex
conjugate, i 7→ −i, which is not a feature of these earlier
models. Finally, as our generation of quarks and lep-
tons will be constructed from Cliﬀord algebra elements,
not column vectors, we will then be free to model weak
isospin, using right multiplication of this same Cliﬀord
algebra onto these minimal left ideals.
Acquaintance with C ⊗ O. The complex octonions
are not a tool commonly used in physics, so we introduce
them here.

Any element of C ⊗ O can be written as P7

n=0 Anen,
where the An are complex coeﬃcients. The en are oc-
tonionic imaginary units (cid:0)e2
n = −1(cid:1), apart from e0 = 1,
which multiply as per Figure 1. The complex imaginary
unit, i, commutes with each of the octonionic en.

Any three imaginary units on a directed line segment
in Figure 1 act as if they were a triplet of Pauli matri-
ces, σm.
(More precisely, they behave as −iσm.) For
example, e6e1 = −e1e6 = e5, e1e5 = −e5e1 = e6,
e5e6 = −e6e5 = e1, e4e1 = −e1e4 = e2, etc.
It is in-
deed true that the octonions form a non-associative al-
gebra, meaning that the relation (ab)c = a(bc) does not
always hold. The reader can check this by ﬁnding three
imaginary units, which are not all on the same line seg-
ment, and substituting them as in a, b, and c. For a more
detailed introduction of O see [20], [21], [22].

Finally, we deﬁne three notions of conjugation on an
element a in C ⊗ O. The complex conjugate of a, denoted
a∗, maps the complex i 7→ −i, as would be expected.

FIG. 1. Multiplication of octonionic imaginary units

The octonionic conjugate of a, denoted ˜a, takes each of
the octonionic imaginary units en 7→ −en for n = 1, . . . 7.
That which we will call the hermitian conjugate of a,
denoted a†, performs both of these maps simultaneously,
i 7→ −i and en 7→ −en for n = 1, . . . 7. The octonionic
conjugate and the hermitian conjugate each reverse the
order of multiplication, as is familiar from the hermitian
conjugate of a product of matrices.
A system of ladder operators. Upon some explo-
ration, one ﬁnds a system of ladder operators within
the complex octonions. Consider α1 ≡ 1
2 (−e5 + ie4),
α2 ≡ 1
2 (−e6 + ie2), similar to
that deﬁned in [7]. For all f in C ⊗ O, and assuming
right-to-left multiplication, these three lowering opera-
tors obey the anticommutation relations

2 (−e3 + ie1) , and α3 ≡ 1

{αi, αj}f = αi(αj f ) + αj(αif ) = 0

(3)

for all i, j = 1, 2, 3. The above can be seen as a general-
ization of the system in [8]. That is, [8] is recovered by
restricting the general f in C ⊗ O to f = 1.

In another slight deviation from [8], we deﬁne raising
2 (e3 + ie1) , and

2 (e5 + ie4), α†2 = 1

operators as α†1 = 1
α†3 = 1

2 (e6 + ie2), which obey

{α†i , α†j}f = 0

for all i, j = 1, 2, 3.

(4)

We ﬁnally also have

{αi, α†j}f = δijf

for all i, j = 1, 2, 3.

(5)

With the purpose simplifying notation, we will now im-
plicitly assume all multiplication to be carried out start-
ing at the right, and moving to the left, as was shown in
equation (3). That is, we will now not write these brack-
ets in explicitly. Furthermore, we will now be concerned
only with operators, such as the αi, as opposed to the
object f . This being the case, it will now be understood
that all equations will hold over all f in C ⊗ O, even
though f will not be mentioned explicitly. For example,
we will now write equation (3) simply as

{αi, αj} = αiαj + αjαi = 0

for all i, j = 1, 2, 3.

(6)

Incidentally, these operators acting on f may be viewed
as 8 × 8 complex matrices acting on f , an eight-complex-
dimensional column vector. Taking into account the
above paragraph, our equations from here on in can be
considered as relations only between the matrices.
Complex conjugation’s analogue. Under complex
conjugation, we ﬁnd an analogous ladder system. Con-
sider α∗1 = 1
2 (−e3 − ie1) , and α∗3 =
1
2 (−e6 − ie2). These three lowering operators obey the
anticommutation relations

2 (−e5 − ie4), α∗2 = 1

{α∗i , α∗j } = 0

for all i, j = 1, 2, 3.

(7)

We deﬁne raising operators as ˜α1 = 1

2 (e5 − ie4), ˜α2 =

1

2 (e3 − ie1) , and ˜α3 = 1

2 (e6 − ie2), which obey

3

The eight-complex-dimensional minimal left ideal for

the ﬁrst ladder system is given by

Su ≡

+ ¯Dr α†1ωω† +
+ U r α†3α†2ωω† +

V ωω†
¯Dg α†2ωω†
U g α†1α†3ωω† + U b α†2α†1ωω†

+ ¯Db α†3ωω†

+ E + α†3α†2α†1ωω†,

(11)
where V, ¯Dr, . . . E + are 8 suggestively named complex
coeﬃcients.

As

{ ˜αi, ˜αj} = 0

for all i, j = 1, 2, 3.

(8)

αi ωω† = 0

∀i,

(12)

Finally, we have also

{α∗i , ˜αj} = δij

for all i, j = 1, 2, 3.

(9)

Using these ladder operators, we will now build min-
imal left ideals, which can be seen to mimic the set of
quarks and leptons of the standard model.
Minimal left ideals. Intuitively speaking, an ideal is a
special subspace of an algebra because it is robust under
multiplication. For this reason, ideals are well suited to
describe particles persisting under evolution and trans-
formation.

Given an algebra, A, a left ideal, B, is a subalgebra of
A whereby ab is in B for all b in B, and for any a in A.
That is, no matter which a we multiply onto b, the new
product, b′ ≡ ab, cannot leave the subspace B. It is easy
to see how b′ ≡ ab could easily describe, for example, a
particle b undergoing a transformation a.

A minimal left ideal is a left ideal which contains no
left ideals other than {0} and itself. In other words, it
has no non-trivial ideals inside it.

In this article, we are proposing to represent quarks
and leptons using minimal left ideals within our space
of octonionic operators: that is, within the space of the
αi, α†j, and their products. A pair of these ideals, Su
and Sd, will be introduced below. Readers wishing to
conﬁrm the construction may consult [13] for an expla-
nation of how left multiplication of C⊗ O on itself gives a
representation of the 64-complex-dimensional Cliﬀord al-
gebra Cl(6). The review, [23], then lucidly describes the
construction of minimal left ideals in Cliﬀord algebras
via Witt decomposition. (For an alternate phase space
perspective on the real Cliﬀord algebra Cl(6), see [24].)

From our ﬁrst ladder system, we deﬁne

ω ≡ α1α2α3,
ω† ≡ α†3α†2α†1,

(10)

which lead to the identies ω†ωω† = ω† and ωω†ωω† =
ωω†.

ωω† plays the role of the vacuum state, where the term
vacuum is used loosely. Readers may recognize the simi-
larity between Su and a Fock space.

The conjugate system analogously leads to

Sd ≡

¯V ω†ω

Dr (−α1ω†ω) + Dg (−α2ω†ω) + Db (−α3ω†ω)
+ ¯U r α3α2ω†ω +
¯U g α1α3ω†ω + ¯U b α2α1ω†ω

+ E− α1α2α3ω†ω,

where ¯V, Dr, . . . E− are eight complex coeﬃcients.

(13)

This new ideal, (13), is linearly independent from the
ﬁrst, (11), in the space of octonionic operators. Clearly,
the two are related via the complex conjugate, i 7→ −i.
In fact, the complex conjugate is all that is needed in
order to map particles into anti-particles, and vice versa.
This was a feature in the models of [8], [13], and also in
models of left- and right-handed Weyl spinors, [5], [6]. It
was not a feature in [10], [11], [12], [17], or [18], where
an additional quaternionic algebra was implemented in
order to obtain Sd.

The Cliﬀord algebra Cl(6) is known to have just a sin-
gle 8-complex-dimensional irreducible representation, as
in Su, above. In this paper, we will none-the-less be in-
cluding the conjugate ideal, Sd, in anticipation of future
work, which will combine Su and Sd into a single irre-
ducible representation under Cl(6)⊗ Cl(2). (Later on, we
will then consider Cl(6) ⊗ Cl(4), suggesting a connection
to the Pati-Salam model.) Unlike in the earlier litera-
ture, this additional factor of Cl(2) will originate from
right multiplication of our octonionic operators on these
ideals, as mentioned at the end of this text. This Su + Sd
form is motivated by the complex multiplicative action,
described in [5].

As a ﬁnal note, we point out that another interesting
way to obtain anti-particles could be to use the conjugate

†, instead of ∗. In that case, the two minimal left ide-
als would not be entirely linearly independent from each
other. That is, we would ﬁnd a special Majorana-like

property unique to the neutrino: (cid:0)ωω†(cid:1)† = ωω†.

Ladders to the unbroken symmetries. Having ob-
tained these minimal left ideals, we would now like to
know how they transform, so as to justify the labels we
gave to their coeﬃcients in equations (11) and (13). It
so happens that a very simple form leads uniquely to
the generators of the two unbroken gauge symmetries of
the standard model, SU (3)c and U (1)em. We will ﬁnd
these generators, and then apply them to our minimal
left ideals.

Consider α ≡ c1α1 + c2α2 + c3α3 and α′ ≡ c′1α1 +
c′2α2 + c′3α3, where the ci and c′j are complex coeﬃcients.
We can then build hermitian operators, H, of the form

H ≡ α′†α + α†α′.

(14)

Taking the most general sum of these objects results in
nine hermitian operators:

H = r0 Q +

X
H

8

X

i=1

riΛi,

(15)

where r0 and ri are real coeﬃcients. Q is our electromag-
netic generator from equation (2), and the eight Λi can
be seen to generate SU (3)c.
Indeed, these Λi coincide
with those introduced in [7] (which generate a subgroup
of the octonionic automorphism group, G2). Readers are
encouraged to also see [5], where these nine generators
are further identiﬁed as symmetry generators preserving
ladder operator structure, otherwise known as unitary
MTIS symmetries.

The result of equation (15) is worth emphasizing. That
is, the simple form, PH
H leads uniquely to the genera-
tors of the two unbroken gauge symmetries of the stan-
dard model.

In terms of ladder operators, the SU (3)c generators

take the form

Λ1 = −α†2α1 − α†1α2 Λ2 = iα†2α1 − iα†1α2
Λ4 = −α†1α3 − α†3α1
Λ3 = α†2α2 − α†1α1
Λ5 = −iα†1α3 + iα†3α1 Λ6 = −α†3α2 − α†2α3
Λ7 = iα†3α2 − iα†2α3

Λ8 = − 1√3 hα†1α1 + α†2α2 − 2α†3α3i ,

(16)
all eight of which can be seen to commute with Q, and
its conjugate.

Now, we take the minimal left ideal, Su, to transform

as

ei P H Su e−i P H = ei P H Su,

(17)

where the equality holds because ω†α†i = 0 for all i.

4

We now identify the subspaces of Su by specifying their
electric charges with respect to U (1)em, and also which
irreducible representation they belong to under SU (3)c.
Clearly, i, j and k are meant to be distinct from each
other in any given row.

of the standard model. These are summarized in Figure

turns out that Su packages all of the isospin up-type
states together, and Sd packages all of the down-type
states together. This is of course, if one goes ahead and
makes an assumption about the placement of ν into Su
and ¯ν into Sd.

isospin down particles into isospin up, via right multipli-
cation on Sd. In doing so, it exhibits features of the W +
boson.

Other characteristics of the W bosons do not appear
at the level of this article. For example, there is nothing
to specify that these candidate bosons act only on left-
handed particles. Some steps in this direction have been
made in Chapter 7 of [5].

FIG. 2. A full generation represented by cubes S u (left) and
S d (right). Quark and electron states may be viewed as exci-
tations from the neutrino or anti-neutrino. As the “vacuum”
represents the neutrino, and not the zero particle state, this
model does not constitute a composite model in the usual
sense.

Conclusion. Using only the complex octonions acting
on themselves, we were able to recover a number of as-
pects of the standard model’s structure.

First of all, we found that a simple hermitian form led
uniquely to the two unbroken gauge symmetries of the
standard model, su(3)c and u(1)em. This new U (1)em
generator, Q, happens to be proportional to a number
operator, thereby suggesting an unexpected resolution to
the question: Why is electric charge quantized?

Then, using octonionic ladder operators, we have built
a pair of minimal left ideals, which is found to transform
under these unbroken symmetries as does a generation of
quarks and leptons.

If the algebra of the complex octonions is not behind
the structure of the standard model, it is then a striking
coincidence that su(3)c and u(1)em both follow readily
from its ladder operators.

Quite some time ago, an interim PhD supervisor, L.
Smolin, suggested looking at anti-down quarks instead
of down quarks in the context of [6]. This advice proved
useful in that it made the electric charge generator im-
mediately recognizable within the analysis.
