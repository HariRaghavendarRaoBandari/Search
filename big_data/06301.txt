An exact calculation of the local electric ﬁeld E(r) is described for the case of a time dependent
point electric dipole pe−iωt in the top layer of an 2, 1, 2 three parallel slabs composite structure,
where the 1 layer has a ﬁnite thickness 2d but the 2 layers are inﬁnitely thick. For this purpose we
ﬁrst calculate all the eigenstates of the full Maxwell equations for the case where µ = 1 everywhere
in the system. The eigenvalues appear as special, non-physical values of 1 when 2 is given. These
eigenstates are then used to develop an exact expansion for the physical values of E(r) in the system
characterized by physical values of 1(ω) and 2(ω). Results are compared with those of a previous
calculation of the local ﬁeld of a time dependent point charge in the quasi-static regime. Numerical
results are shown for the local electric ﬁeld in practically important conﬁgurations where attaining
an optical image with sub-wavelength resolution has practical signiﬁcance.

INTRODUCTION

In order to have a physical electromagnetic (EM) ﬁeld
in some system volume it is usually necessary to have
either a ﬁeld incident from outside of the system volume
or a non-vanishing charge density and current density
inside the system. However, when the material in the
system has certain special values of its material parame-
ters, a ﬁeld can arise in the system spontaneously. Such
a state is an EM eigenstate and the special parameters
are the appropriate eigenvalues. While such eigenstates
can never be realized in a passive physical system, be-
cause the necessary values of its material parameters are
unachievable in a real material, these states are often
useful in particular circumstances. Thus, a real material
can have parameters that approach some of the eigenval-
ues, in which case the EM response of such a material
can become anomalously strong. Furthermore, the EM
ﬁeld of a real physical system can be expanded in a series
of the eigenstates, leading to an alternative approach to
the calculation of that ﬁeld and its consequences. Such
an approach was used in the past to describe the scatter-
ing of EM radiation by a collection of spheres [1]. Such
an approach was also applied, in the past, to calculate
the macroscopic response of a collection of spheres in the
quasi-static regime, i.e., the macroscopic electric permit-
tivity e of such a material [2, 3]. More recently, such
an approach was used to compute the local electric ﬁeld
in a special structure, known as the Veselago Lens [4],
where it had been claimed that an EM image was achiev-
able with unrestricted resolution [5]. By exploiting an
expansion of the local electric ﬁeld in the exact quasi-

In Refs.

static eigenstates for the case of a point charge, a much
more detailed analysis of this system became possible
[6, 7]. In previous discussions the asymptotic expression
for the potential at the interface between the lens and
the medium when 1 = −2, both real, was shown to
diverge [8–10].
[6, 7] an exact expression for
the potential (in all space) in the form of a 1D integral
was derived for general complex permittivity values and
it was shown that the imaging, in terms of both inten-
sity and resolution, is optimal at the interface. In recent
works a 2D setup of a coated cylinder with an external
line source was analyzed using the full Maxwell equations
and the asymptotic expression for the electric ﬁeld at the
interface when 1 = −2, both real, was shown to diverge
[10, 11].
In this article we attempt to extend the ap-
proach of Refs. [6, 7] to expand the electric ﬁeld (in all
space) in the exact eigenstates of the full Maxwell equa-
tions for complex permittivity values and a general 3D
current distribution. This will be used to extend the dis-
cussion of a Veselago Lens to the non-quasi-static regime.
The formalism enables to calculate the electric ﬁeld also
for current sources in a simple manner, avoiding the com-
plex calculation of the scattering of the electric ﬁeld of
these sources.

The general theory for this is developed in Section II.
In Section III the eigenstates are calculated in closed form
for the special structure of a ﬂat slab, which is also the
structure of the Veselago Lens. In Section IV these eigen-
states are used to expand the local EM ﬁeld produced in
such a lens by an oscillating point electric dipole source
directed parallel and perpendicular to the slab. Section V
includes a summary of our main results and a discussion
of possible future extensions of the approach developed
here.

II. THEORY OF THE EIGENSTATES OF

MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS IN A

TWO-CONSTITUENT COMPOSITE MEDIUM

WHERE µ = 1

We assume that all physical quantities are monochro-
matic functions of time, namely that they are propor-
tional to e−iωt. We conﬁne ourselves to the case where
µ = 1 everywhere, but the position dependent electric
permittivity (r) has two diﬀerent values corresponding
to a two-constituent composite medium:

(r) = 1θ1(r) + 2θ2(r),

(2.1)
where θi(r), i = 1, 2 is a step function equal to 1 when r
is inside the i constituent and equal to 0 elsewhere. Note
that i is usually complex and includes any electrical con-
ductivity that the constituents may have. Assuming that
all the EM ﬁelds are monochromatic and a general cur-
rent distribution, Maxwell’s equations become, in Gaus-
sian units,

∇ · (E) = 0, ∇ × E =

H,

iω

∇ · H = 0, ∇ × H = − iω

(2.2)

From these we can obtain the following equation for the
local electric ﬁeld E(r):

(2.4)

The last diﬀerential equation can be transformed into
an integral equation by using a tensor Green function
Gαβ(r, r(cid:48), k2), deﬁned by

− ∇ × (∇× ↔

G= k2

G) + k2
2

(2.5)
and by appropriate outgoing boundary conditions at
large distances |r − r(cid:48)|. Noting that Gαβ(r, r(cid:48), k) will
depend on those position vectors only through their dif-
ference R ≡ r− r(cid:48), we ﬁrst apply a spatial Fourier trans-
formation to this equation. This results in a linear alge-
braic equation for the Fourier transform of Gαβ(r− r(cid:48), k)
which is easily solved, leading to the following expression
for that Fourier transform:

The last integration here was carried out by adding to the
real axis of q an inﬁnite radius semi-circle in the upper
complex plane of q and then using Cauchy’s theorem to
evaluate the integral over the resulting closed contour.
↔
G (r−r(cid:48), k) was obtained
This closed form expression for
many years ago in Ref. [1].
↔
G (r − r(cid:48), k2) we can now “solve” Eq. (2.3) by
treating its rhs as if it were known. In this way we get
the following integral equation for the local electric ﬁeld
E(r):

Using

ˆ

E = E0 + uˆΓE,
ˆΓE ≡
dV (cid:48)θ1(r(cid:48))

↔
G (r − r(cid:48), k2) · E(r(cid:48)),

(2.8)

(2.9)

where E0 is the the electric ﬁeld generated by the exter-
nal sources J (r) in a uniform 2 medium.

The scalar product of two vector ﬁelds F(r), E(r) is

now deﬁned by

ˆ

dV θ1(r)F∗(r) · E(r).

(2.10)

(cid:104)F|E(cid:105) ≡

Under this deﬁnition ˆΓ is a symmetric operator, as de-
ﬁned in Appendix A, because Gαβ(R, k) = Gβα(−R, k),
↔
G (r− r(cid:48), k2) is complex
but it is non-Hermitian because
valued. Thus the left eigenstates of ˆΓ ,
dual states of its right eigenstates and the left and right
eigenvalues are the same:

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) are just the

dV (cid:48)θ1(r(cid:48))En(r(cid:48))· ↔

G (r(cid:48) − r, k)

↔
G (r − r(cid:48), k) · En(r(cid:48)) = (cid:104)r|ˆΓ|En(cid:105)

sn(cid:104) ˜En| = (cid:104) ˜En|ˆΓ,

(2.11)

where (cid:104) ˜En|r(cid:105) = (cid:104)r| ˜En(cid:105)∗ ≡ (cid:104)r|En(cid:105) ≡ En(r).
following property for any two states |E(cid:105) and |F(cid:105)

Because ˆΓ is a symmetric operator it therefore has the

(cid:104) ˜F|ˆΓ|E(cid:105) = (cid:104) ˜E|ˆΓ|F(cid:105).

From this it is now easy to show that the eigenstates and
their duals satisfy

Gαβ(q, k) =

qαqβ − k2δαβ

q2 − k2

.

(2.6)

(cid:104) ˜En|Em(cid:105) = 0

(2.12)

The inverse Fourier transform of this, with the boundary
condition of an outgoing or evanescent wave at large dis-
tances, is found by ﬁrst integrating over the direction of
the three-dimensional vector q, leading to the remaining
integral over the magnitude of q (q ≡ |q|):

if sn (cid:54)= sm.

The scalar product of a left eigenstate and a right

eigenstate of ˆΓ can be written as follows:

ˆ

(cid:104) ˜Fn|Em(cid:105) =

dV θ1(r)Fn(r) · Em(r).

(2.13)

This diﬀers from Eq. (2.10) because the dual eigenfunc-
tion (cid:104)r| ˜Fn(cid:105) is not equal to the eigenfunction (cid:104)r|Fn(cid:105) but
rather to its complex conjugate (cid:104)r|Fn(cid:105)∗. Clearly, in the

general case where these eigenfunctions are complex val-
ued this scalar product is not assured to be real or posi-
tive and could vanish even when the states |Em(cid:105) and |Fn(cid:105)
are the same, because the integrand is θ1(r)[En(r)]2 and
not θ1(r)|En(r)|2. Thus, the question of normalizability
of the eigenstates must be investigated for each of them
separately. We will nevertheless assume that they are
normalizable in our case and that they therefore form a
complete set. Thus, from the pair of equations (2.11)
we conclude that the unit operator can be expanded in
terms of those states and their duals | ˜En(cid:105) as

(cid:88)

n

11 =

|En(cid:105)(cid:104)˜En|
(cid:104) ˜En|En(cid:105) .

(2.14)

We can now write the following formal solution of Eq.

(2.8):

|E(cid:105) =

1 − uˆΓ

|E0(cid:105) = |E0(cid:105) +

and insert the unit operator of Eq. (2.14) to obtain

|E(cid:105) − |E0(cid:105) =

sn
s − sn

|En(cid:105)(cid:104) ˜En|E0(cid:105)
(cid:104) ˜En|En(cid:105) ,

(2.17)

(cid:88)

n

where sn ≡ 2/ (2 − 1,n) and 1,n is the eigenvalue
which corresponds to sn.

It is now useful to recall that the eigenstates of ˆΓ fall

into two classes [1]:

1. Longitudinal eigenstates E(r) = ∇φ(r). For these
states the eigenvalue will always be s = 1 and E(r)
must vanish outside the 1 volume. Inside that vol-
ume φ(r) is almost arbitrary and the diﬀerential
equation (2.3) is satisﬁed in a trivial fashion. The
only restriction on φ(r) is due to the fact that the
tangential component of E(r) must be continuous
at the 1, 2 interface. Since its tangential com-
ponent must vanish there, therefore φ(r) must be
constant over every connected piece of that inter-
face. Obviously, the magnetic ﬁeld H(r) vanishes
everywhere for these states.

2. All the eigenstates for which s (cid:54)= 1 (these are trans-
verse ﬁelds). From Eq. (2.3) it follows that ∇·E = 0
inside both the 1 and the 2 regions, though not
at their interface. These states must obey Eq. (2.3)
in a nontrivial fashion.

Although the Class 1 eigenstates are diﬃcult to cata-
log, since they have a degenerate eigenvalue, it turns out
that they are not needed for expanding any physical so-
lutions of Eq. (2.3). That is because they are orthogonal
to any solution E(r) of Maxwell’s equations. To see this,
we denote by E1(r) ≡ ∇φ1 any longitudinal eigenstate
and write
(cid:104) ˜E1|E(cid:105) =

dV [∇ · (φ1E) − φ1∇ · E] ,

dV θ1E1 · E =

ˆ

ˆ

V1

3

where V1 is the 1 subvolume. The second term under the
last integral vanishes because the ﬁeld E(r) is a trans-
verse ﬁeld inside V1 as long as 1 (cid:54)= 0—see Eq. (2.2).
(Note that in a real physical material 1 can never vanish:
It must always have a nonzero imaginary part which rep-
resents dissipation.) The ﬁrst term can be transformed
into a surface integral over the 1, 2 interface, where φ1
is a constant, denoted by φ1i, over every connected por-
tion of that interface. Transforming the surface integral
back to a sum of volume integrals over the diﬀerent con-
nected pieces Vi of V1, where φ1 is replaced by φ1i which
is constant over any connected volume piece Vi, each of
those integrals can be written as

ˆ

φ1i

Vi

dV ∇ · E = 0.

We have thus shown that (cid:104) ˜E1|E(cid:105) = 0 for u (cid:54)= 1.

The physical signiﬁcance of the Class 2 eigenstates is
that at special values of 1/2 (the eigenvalues) a wave
can arise in the system spontaneously, i.e., without the
presence of an incident wave or any source of radiation.
Since the ﬁelds are periodic in time, the local energy den-
sity must be constant when averaged over one period.
However, if the eigenfunction is an outgoing propagating
wave at large distances then it constantly radiates energy
out to inﬁnity. In order to preserve the local energy den-
sity the system must therefore create energy. For this to
happen then at least one of the two constituent permittiv-
ities must have an imaginary part with the “wrong sign”.
Thus, if 2, which is where the outgoing wave must prop-
agate, has a physically admissible value with an imag-
inary part that has the right sign, then 1 will have to
have an imaginary part with the wrong sign. This means,
of course, that the system can never actually be at a res-
onance, but can only approach it if the magnitude of the
right signed physical Im 2, as well as the magnitude of
the wrong signed eigenvalue Im 1, are small. On the
other hand, if the eigenfunction decays exponentially at
large distances, and thus no energy is radiated, then the
special values of 1/2 and s ≡ 2/(2 − 1) can be real.
If all the eigenvalues sn are non-degenerate then the
above analysis often suﬃces to ﬁx the states |En(cid:105) as a
basis of Hilbert space, subject to their normalizability.
However, if the system has some symmetries, which are
represented by Hermitian or unitary operators ˆPi that
commute with ˆΓ, then that complicates the situation:
We usually try to characterize the eigenstates of ˆΓ by
requiring them to also be eigenstates of those symmetry
operators. However, since the operator ˆΓ is symmetric we
deﬁned (cid:104) ˜En|r(cid:105) ≡ (cid:104)r|En(cid:105), whereas the requirement for the
eigenstates of Hermitian operators is that (cid:104)ψ|r(cid:105) = (cid:104)r|ψ(cid:105)∗.
An example of a symmetry generator is the inﬁnitesimal
spatial translation operator −i∇, where

−i∇eiq·r = qeiq·r,

which is relevant for any microstructure that has trans-
lational symmetry along certain directions. Clearly, the

all components of the magnetic ﬁeld, at the 1, 2 in-
terfaces. The microstructure is also invariant under the
reﬂection z → −z. These symmetries are not violated by
complex conjugation of the eigenfunctions. Therefore the
eigenfunctions can be characterized as transverse electric
(TE) or transverse magnetic (TM), and also as even (+)
or odd (−) under z → −z.

(cid:113)

In the following subsections we will ﬁrst ﬁnd closed
form expressions for the eigenstates and closed form ex-
pressions for the nonlinear equation whose solutions are
the eigenvalues.
In order to discuss qualitatively the
properties of the eigenvalues we will restrict our consid-
erations to the case where 2 is real and positive.
In
that case, when |k| < k2, k2z =
2 − |k|2 is real and
k2
the mode propagates out of the slab. However, when
|k| > k2, k2z =
2 − |k|2 is imaginary and the mode
k2
decays away from the slab. We refer to these modes, re-
spectively, as propagating and evanescent modes. When
|k| = k2, k2z = 0 and the mode propagates parallel to
the slab without any decay or radiation away from the
slab.

(cid:113)

In Section III C we will describe numerical calculations
of the eigenvalues for the general non-quasistatic cases
[Eqs. (3.1), (3.3)] and their consequences. When the
physical value of 1 is very close to one of the eigenvalues
the contribution of this eigenstate to the physical electric
ﬁeld can become very large, greatly exceeding the ﬁeld in
the absence of the 1 layer (Region II). When the physi-
cal 2 ≈ −1 then s ≈ 1/2 and sk/ (s − sk) becomes very
large for many of the TM eigenstates when k is large.
This may lead to a large contribution of the large |k|
modes to the expansion of the electric ﬁeld in Eq. (2.17),
as already found earlier in the quasi-static regime [6, 7].

complex conjugate of any such eigenfunction will have the
diﬀerent eigenvalue −q. This problem can be overcome
as follows: In the subspace of the complex conjugates of
all the right eigenfunctions (cid:104)r|Fn(cid:105) of ˆΓ with the same
eigenvalue sn as (cid:104)r|En(cid:105) we choose one such that (cid:104)r|Fn(cid:105)∗
is a right eigenfunction of −i∇ with the same eigenvalue
as (cid:104)r|En(cid:105). This is done in Section III below for the par-
ticular case of a ﬂat slabs microstructure.

III. EIGENSTATES OF A FLAT SLABS

MICROSTRUCTURE

Consider a medium with electric permittivity 2 in
which there is a ﬂat slab, of thickness 2d, with a dif-
ferent electric permittivity 1 (see Fig. 1). The magnetic
permeabilty is everywhere equal to 1, as in the vacuum
[here and throughout this article we use Gaussian units
for all electromagnetic (EM) quantities]. This is also the
structure of a Veselago Lens, which will be discussed in
Section IV below.

This microstructure is uniform in all x, y-planes, there-

fore all the eigenstates can have the form

(cid:104)r|En(cid:105) = eik·ρf (z),

where k is a real 2D wave vector in the x, y-plane while
ρ is a 2D position vector in that plane. It is easy to show
that f (z) satisﬁes the following ordinary second order dif-

ferential equation(cid:18) d2

f = uθ1(r)f ,

where θ1(r) = 1 for |z| < d and vanishes elsewhere. In
each region of z this is a one-dimensional Helmholtz equa-
tion, the solution of which is a linear combination of sine
and cosine functions with coeﬃcients that must satisfy
∇ · E = 0 in each region. They must also satisfy the
outgoing wave condition for |z| > d and continuity re-
quirements on Ex and Ey and Dz ≡ Ez, as well as on

From this equation it follows that the eigenvalues of k±

1k depend only on the magnitude k of the 2D wave
vector k. The eigenfunctions depend on the direction of
that vector only through the eik·ρ factor. When 2 is real
and positive and k > k2 then k2z is imaginary and the
eigenstate is evanescent and non-radiating. Also, we can
write k2z ≡ iκ2z, leading to the following form for the
eigenvalue equation

1k and s±
k are real and involve no dissipation and no
creation of energy. Many of those ±
1k eigenvalues are
negative and therefore the appropriate values of s±
k lie
between 0 and 1, as we found in the past for all the s±
eigenvalues in the quasistatic limit [6].

k

When k is less than k2 then k2z is real and the eigen-
states will be radiating energy away from the 1 slab. In
that case the eigenvalues k±
1z will be complex and usually
have real and imaginary parts, as can be seen from Eq.
(3.1). In this case ±
1 must have an imaginary part with

that in the limit |k| → ∞ the eigenvalues 1k tend to −2
and hence sk ≈ 1/2. Thus, when the physical 2 ≈ −1,
s ≈ 1/2 and sk/ (s − sk) → ∞. Thus, the evanescent
eigenstates which have spatial frequencies |k| > k2 play
an important role in the imaging and can lead to an en-
hanced resolution image as argued in Ref. [5].

C. Calculation of the eigenvalues

The permittivity values and the slab thickness in the
following calculations correspond to the values in the
experiment with the PMMA-silver-photoresist setup de-
scribed in Ref. [12], where in our case 1 is the silver per-
mittivity and 2 is the average permittivity of PMMA
and the photoresist. These permittivity values are ap-
propriate for a free-space wavelength of 365nm. We cal-
culated the eigenvalues of the even and odd TM and TE
modes according to Eqs. (3.1) and (3.3), respectively, for
2d = 35nm, λ = 365nm and 2 = 2.57 + 0.09i. For any
choice of k ≡ |k| there is an inﬁnite number of solutions
to the eigenvalue equations. Fortunately, for modes with
high eigenvalues 1k, sk/ (s − sk) → 0 and these modes
give a negligible contribution to the expansion of the elec-
tric ﬁeld (see Eq. (2.17)). We deﬁne these modes as the
high order modes and associate low mode index numbers
to the modes with low 1k values.

1. Eigenvalues of the TM modes

In Fig. 2 we present the eigenvalues of the ﬁrst even
and odd TM modes as functions of |k|. It can be seen

FIG. 2: The eigenvalues for the ﬁrst even and odd TM modes
as functions of |k| .

In Fig. 3 we present the eigenvalues of the second
even and odd TM modes as functions of |k|. The second
even mode has high values of Re (1k) which means that
sk/ (s − sk) ≈ 0 and the contribution of this mode to the
expansion is very small.
Interestingly, the second odd
mode, even though for large values of |k| has high values
of Re (1k), in the range where |k| ≈ 0 has 1k ≈ 0 which
means that sk/ (s − sk) is not negligible for our physical
1 and can become large for 1 ≈ 0.

Since the eigenstates do not decay in magnitude with
time, one should expect that there should be constructive
interference inside the slab. To verify this we calculated
for the k = 0 eigenstates of the ﬁrst two even and odd
TM modes the phase accumulated due to the propagation
in the z and −z directions inside the slab and the double
reﬂection from the interfaces. The total phases for the
round-trips inside the slab which were calculated were all
integer multiples of 2π as expected.

FIG. 4: The eigenvalues for the ﬁrst even and odd TE modes

2. Eigenvalues of the TE modes

In Fig. 4 we present the eigenvalues of the ﬁrst even
and odd TE modes as functions of |k|. It can be seen
that in the limit |k| → ∞ the eigenvalues 1k tend to in-
ﬁnity. When |k| = 0 the modes propagate perpendicular
to the slab and can therefore be deﬁned both as TM and
TE. This is apparent in the equality of the TM and TE
eigenvalues at |k| = 0.
In Fig. 5 we present the eigenvalues of the second
even and odd TE modes as functions of |k|. Here too,
the eigenvalues at |k| = 0 are the same as those of the
TM modes. It can also be seen that the ﬁrst even and
second odd TE modes at |k| ≈ 0 can give a small and
a signiﬁcant contribution to the expansion of E (r), re-
spectively, since their 1k values are not far from physical
values of 1. On the other hand, the ﬁrst odd and second
even TE modes should give a negligible contribution to
the expansion since their 1k values are far from physical
values of 1. Interestingly, the eigenvalues of the second
odd TE mode have a small imaginary part and are close
to physical 1 values which are realizable in experiments.

IV. USING THE EIGENSTATE EXPANSION TO

CALCULATE THE ELECTRIC FIELD OF A

POINT ELECTRIC DIPOLE IN A FLAT SLABS

STRUCTURE

We now use the eigenfunctions derived in Section III to
expand the resulting electric ﬁeld. Fig. 1 shows this struc-
ture, where the object and images according to geomet-
rical optics are represented by circles. We will consider
oscillating electric point dipoles in Region III directed
along z and x axes as the source of the EM ﬁeld.

A. Dipole object directed along z

We consider an oscillating electric point dipole at
r = (0, 0, z0) ≡ z0 in Region III directed along z as the
source of the EM ﬁeld. The current distribution of the
dipole at z0 can be written as Jdip = −iezωpδ3 (r − z0)
where p is the electric dipole moment.

The electric ﬁeld of this dipole in a uniform 2 medium

the appearance of k2 ≡ √

using Green’s function of Eq. (2.7) and Jdip deﬁned
above, therefore the scalar product (cid:104) ˜E±

tegration over the azimuth angle ϕ between k and ρ can
be carried out analytically, as we show in Section IV A 1

to be calculated numerically. Those integrals are shown
below.

One can see from Eq. (4.2) that when the source is
located far from the slab, the evanescent eigenstates give
only a small contribution to Eq. (4.5) since they have a
small amplitude at that location. This is apparent from
the exponential factor in Eq. (4.4) which expresses this
evanescent behavior.

1. Analytic integration with respect to ϕ

We notice that in the eigenstate expansion the only
expression which depends on the 2D orientation of k is
|E±

ϕ can be performed analytically

2. Calculation of the integrands as functions of |k|

We calculated the integrands in Eq. (4.7) for the ﬁrst
two even and odd TM modes for the coordinates z =
−d, ρ = 0. This was performed by simply substituting the
physical parameters and the eigenvalues in sk/ (s − sk)
and in Eqs. (3.2),(4.4) and (4.6), where in the last ex-
pression we also substituted the coordinates. In Fig. 6 we
present the integrands as functions of |k|. It can be seen
that the modes with the dominant contribution to the
expansion are the ﬁrst even and odd modes. The second
even and odd modes give a negligible contribution and
a very small contribution to the expansion, respectively
(very small values of the integrand of the second even
mode which cannot be seen in the ﬁgure). This validates
our analysis in the previous subsection.

3. Calculation of the electric ﬁeld

a. A setup with 2 = 2.57 + 0.09i, 1 = −2.55 + 0.24i
We calculated the electric ﬁeld in the three regions by
numerically integrating Eq. (4.7) with respect to |k| . In

FIG. 6:
odd TM modes at ρ = 0, z = −d.

Integrands of Eq. (4.7) for the ﬁrst two even and

Fig. 7 we present |E|2 in the three regions for a dipole
located at z = d + 7 · (2d) /8 and permittivity values of
1 = −2.55 + 0.24i, 2 = 2.57 + 0.09i. The white circles
denote the object and the image expected according to
geometrical optics. In this ﬁgure, as well as in Fig. 9 that
display all the regions, we used a linear color scale. In
order to present an informative ﬁgure we mapped all the
values higher than a certain value to this value. Thus,
in all the locations which exhibit the highest value, the
actual values are often much higher than the apparent
value. It can be seen that the maximal intensity is at the
interfaces between the slab and the surrounding medium.
In Fig. 8 we present |E|2, normalized by the maximal
horizontal intensity, in Region I for two horizontally dis-

tanced electric dipole sources. The location of the second
dipole was set to be such that the ﬁeld intensity at the
midpoint between the two images is e−1/2 times the in-
tensity at the image maximum. We deﬁne this distance
as the separation distance needed to resolve the two im-
ages. It can be seen that the optimal resolution is at the
interface between the slab and the medium. Thus, the
optimal imaging is at the interface between the slab and
Region I in terms of both intensity and resolution. These
results are in agreement with our quasistatic analysis in
Ref. [7].
b. A setup in which s − 1/2 is divided by 1000 We
divided ∆s ≡ s − 1
2 by 1000 and calculated the electric
ﬁeld in the three regions. This setup, in which 1 is much
closer to −2, was expected to achieve better resolution
according to the explanation in Subsection III C. In Fig.
9 we present |E|2 in the three regions for a dipole located
at z = d+7·(2d) /8 (top region) and ∆s divided by 1000.
It can be seen that the intensity here is higher by more
than an order of magnitude compared to the previous
case.
In Fig. 10 we present the horizontally normalized
|E|2 in Region I for two horizontally distanced dipoles.

Here, too, the optimal resolution is at the interface be-
tween the slab and Region I.

In conclusion, when we decrease ∆s, 1 becomes closer
to 1k for the evanescent modes. Thus, there is a stronger
ampliﬁcation of these modes and the resolution is further
enhanced since modes with higher |k| values are exploited
It should be noted that ∆s ≈ 0 can
in the imaging.
be achieved also when the imaginary parts of 1 and 2
have opposite signs, in which case one of the constituents
exhibits dissipation while the other exhibits gain.

B. Dipole object directed along x

We consider an oscillating electric point dipole at
r = (0, 0, z0) ≡ z0 in Region III directed along x as the
source of the EM ﬁeld. The current distribution of the
dipole at z0 can be written as Jdip = −iexωpδ3 (r − z0)
where p is the electric dipole moment. The electric ﬁeld
of this dipole in a uniform 2 medium is given by the
expression in Eq. (4.1), where p = pex.

3. Calculation of the integrands as functions of k

We calculated the integrands in Eq. (4.14) for the ﬁrst
two even and odd TM and TE modes for the coordinates
z = −d, ρ = 0. In Fig. 11 we present the absolute value of
the integrands as functions of |k|. It can be seen that the
modes with the dominant contribution to the expansion
are the ﬁrst even and odd TM modes and the second odd
TE mode. While the contribution of the ﬁrst even and
odd TM modes originates from sk/(s− sk) since 1k ≈ 1
for k > k2, the contribution of the second odd TE mode
originates from sk which appears when there are current
sources since 1k ≈ 2 for k ≈ k2.

4. Calculation of the electric ﬁeld

We calculated the electric ﬁeld in the three regions
(4.14) with respect
by numerically integrating Eq.

cated at z = d + 7 · (2d) /8 and permittivity values of
1 = −2.55 + 0.24i, 2 = 2.57 + 0.09i. It can be seen that
the intensity peaks at the top interface at x = 0 and at
the bottom interface there are two peaks at x = −23 nm
and x = 23nm. In Fig. 13 we present the intensity for
the dipole at the x = 0 plane. It can be seen that in-
tensity peaks at the top and bottom interfaces at y = 0
and that the horizontal width of the intensity is smaller
compared to the previous case.
In Fig. 14 we present the horizontally normalized |E|2
I for two dipole objects shifted in the y axis.

The white circles denote the images expected according
to geometric optics. It can be seen that the optimal sep-
aration between the images is at the interface. In Fig. 15
we present the horizontally normalized |E|2 in Reg. I for
two dipole objects shifted in the x axis. Since each im-
age is approximately composed of a sum two Gaussians
we regarded the separation between the images as the
separation between the two internal Gaussians (higher
intensity due to constructive interference). Here too, the
optimal separation between the images is at the interface.

Veriﬁcation of the results

To verify our results we checked the continuity of the
physical Dz at the interfaces. This continuity is not triv-

ially satisﬁed as the continuity of Dz of each eigenmode
is satisﬁed for the eigenvalue 1k and not for the physi-
cal value of 1. In fact each term in Eq. (2.17) usually
violates the continuity of Dz at the interfaces for the
physical permittivity values. We calculated Dz through-
out the interfaces and it was found to be continuous to
a very high precision for the perpendicular and parallel
dipole calculations.

V. DISCUSSION

We presented an exact calculation of the local electric
ﬁeld E(r) for a setup of an 1 slab in an 2 medium and
a time dependent electric point dipole pe−iωt situated in
the medium and directed parallel and perpendicular to
the slab. For this purpose we ﬁrst reformulated the diﬀer-
ential equation which follows from Maxwell’s equations
as an integro-diﬀerential equation and expressed E(r) in
terms of the eigenfunctions of the setup. We constructed
all the TE and TM modes for the setup using its sym-
metry properties. We then simpliﬁed the calculation of
(cid:104) ˜En|E0(cid:105) for external current sources in order to enable
that calculation to be performed analytically. We cal-
culated the eigenvalues of the even and odd TM and TE
modes as functions of |k| . Finally, we calculated |E|2 and
the horizontal resolution for permittivity values which
match the PMMA-silver-photoresist experiment [12] and
for a setup in which ∆s is divided by 1000.

The set of eigenvalues 1k are non-physical values
which are determined by the values of 2, λ and d. When
the physical value of 1 (ω) of the slab becomes closer to

1k

1k, the incoming EM wave with the same |k| will experi-
ence ampliﬁcation. Since the eigenvalues 1k sometimes
tend to −2 when |k| → ∞, a slab with 1 ≈ −2 will
amplify the evanescent waves, resulting in enhanced res-
olution. When 1 further approaches −2, modes with
higher |k| will also be employed in the imaging, result-
ing in further enhanced resolution. The optimal imaging,
as in our quasistatic analysis [6, 7], was found to be not
at the geometric optics foci but at the interface between
the slab and Region I. In addition, when there are current
sources an additional sk factor is introduced, resulting in
another singularity when 1k ≈ 2. Interestingly, the sec-
ond odd TM and TE modes in the range where |k| ≈ 0
have −
≈ 0. The second odd TE mode in the range
|k| < k2 has −
1k which are close to real. These ranges of
1k are not far from 1 values which are realizable in ex-
periments and may have implications in optical devices
where ampliﬁcation of optical signals is important.
In
addition, since for the second odd TE mode 1k ≈ 2 for
k ≈ k2 there is an enhancement of the electric ﬁeld due to
the additional sk factor which is introduced when there
are current sources.

The formalism enables to calculate the electric ﬁeld
of oscillating current sources in a simple manner, avoid-
ing the complex calculation of the scattering of the elec-
tric ﬁeld emanating from these sources. Since current
sources are used to represent polarized media and objects
in imaging, the formalism can ﬁnd use in many applica-
tions.

Appendix A: The left and right eigenstates of a
symmetric operator as a bi-orthogonal basis in

Hilbert space

This Appendix is based upon material covered in Sec-
tion II of Ref. 1.
For any state |ψ(cid:105) in Hilbert space we deﬁne the “dual
state” | ˜ψ(cid:105) by citing the following relation for its wave

(cid:104)r| ˜ψ(cid:105) ≡ (cid:104)r|ψ(cid:105)∗ = (cid:104)ψ|r(cid:105).

(A1)

An operator ˆΓ will be called symmetric if it satisﬁes

(cid:104) ˜φ|ˆΓ|ψ(cid:105) = (cid:104) ˜ψ|ˆΓ|φ(cid:105)

for any two states |φ(cid:105), |ψ(cid:105) in Hilbert space. Using the
wave function representation for these states we can write
their scalar product (cid:104) ˜φ|ψ(cid:105) in the following explicit form
as an intergral over space

ˆ

ˆ

(cid:104) ˜φ|ψ(cid:105) =

d3r(cid:104) ˜φ|r(cid:105)(cid:104)r|ψ(cid:105) =

d3r(cid:104)r|φ(cid:105)(cid:104)r|ψ(cid:105) = (cid:104) ˜ψ|φ(cid:105).
(A2)
If |ψn(cid:105) is a right eigenstate of the symmetric operator

ˆΓ

ˆΓ|ψn(cid:105) = sn|ψn(cid:105)

then (cid:104) ˜ψn| is a left eigenstate of ˆΓ with same eigenvalue
sn since the following holds for any state |ψ(cid:105) in Hilbert
space:

(cid:104) ˜ψn|ˆΓ|ψ(cid:105) = (cid:104) ˜ψ|ˆΓ|ψn(cid:105) = sn(cid:104) ˜ψ|ψn(cid:105) = sn(cid:104) ˜ψn|ψ(cid:105),

therefore

(cid:104) ˜ψn|ˆΓ = sn(cid:104) ˜ψn|.

(A3)

By considering a pair of right and left eigenstates we

get that

(cid:104) ˜ψm|ˆΓ|ψn(cid:105) = sm(cid:104) ˜ψm|ψn(cid:105) = sn(cid:104) ˜ψm|ψn(cid:105).

Thus, if sm (cid:54)= sn then these two states must be mutually
orthogonal, i.e., (cid:104) ˜ψm|ψn(cid:105) = (cid:104) ˜ψn|ψm(cid:105) = 0. Such a set
of states is called a bi-orthogonal set. From Eq. (A2) it
follows that the scalar product of any state |ψ(cid:105) and its
dual | ˜ψ(cid:105) becomes

ˆ

(cid:104) ˜ψ|ψ(cid:105) =

d3r(cid:104)r|ψ(cid:105)2.

(A4)

Because the integrand is not necessarily positive nor even
real, this integral could possibly vanish. In order for the
set of right eigenstates of ˆΓ to be a complete set in Hilbert
space, i.e., a basis, the scalar product of any eigenstate
|ψn(cid:105) and its dual must be nonzero. This needs to be veri-
ﬁed for all the eigenstates. If this requirement is satisﬁed
then the unit operator can be written as

|ψn(cid:105)(cid:104) ˜ψn|
(cid:104) ˜ψn|ψn(cid:105)

(A5)

and the state |ψ(cid:105) can be expanded in a series of the right
eigenstates |ψn(cid:105)

(A6)

These eigenstates are called a “bi-orthogonal basis” of
Hibert space.

A complication arises when eigenstates of ˆΓ are degen-
erate due to the existence of symmetry operators. Those
are one or more Hermitian or unitary operators ˆP that
commute with ˆΓ.
In that case we often like to select
eigenstates of ˆΓ that are also eigenstates of ˆP . A diﬃ-
culty occurs when the complex conjugation that leads to
the dual eigenstate of ˆΓ results in a state which is not
an eigenstate of ˆP or is an eigenstate of ˆP with a diﬀer-
ent eigenvalue. Such a situation occurs in the case of a
spherical inclusion and also in the case of a ﬂat slabs mi-
crostructure. The ﬁrst case was discussed in Ref. 1 while
the second case is discussed in Section III of the current
article.

For ∆s = 0 the regions where the electric ﬁeld diverges
are between the images expected according to geometric
optics in Regions I and II. This is in agreement with the
conclusions in Ref.
[6] where a point charge object was

considered. For ∆s = 0 the electric ﬁeld (where it does
not diverge) in Reg I,II and III is equal to the electric
ﬁeld of point dipoles located at the geometric image foci
directed in the ˆz,−ˆz and ˆz directions respectively. This
is in agreement with the results in Ref. [6] in which the
electric ﬁeld of a point charge object and ∆s = 0, in

17

Regions I,II and III is equal to the electric ﬁeld of point

charges located at the geometric image foci.
