We present a universal characterization scheme for chimera states applicable to both numerical and exper-
imental data sets. The scheme is based on two correlation measures that enable a meaningful deﬁnition of
chimera states as well as their classiﬁcation into three categories: stationary, turbulent and breathing.
In
addition, these categories can be further subdivided according to the time-stationarity of these two measures.
We demonstrate that this approach both is consistent with previously recognized chimera states and enables
us to classify states as chimeras which have not been categorized as such before. Furthermore, the scheme
allows for a qualitative and quantitative comparison of experimental chimeras with chimeras obtained through
numerical simulations.

The paper “Coexistence of Coherence and Inco-
herence in Nonlocally Coupled Phase Oscillators”
by Kuramoto and Battogtokh published in 20021
marks the commencement of intense research ac-
tivities on a counter-intuitive phenomenon that
has come to be known as a chimera state2, i.e.,
the coexistence of coherent and incoherent dy-
namics in a network of symmetrically coupled
identical oscillators. For a long time, the coex-
istence of coherence and incoherence had been
believed to be bound to heterogeneous networks
of oscillators,
in which oscillators with a simi-
lar frequency might mutually synchronize, while
those with larger deviations of their frequencies
from the mean frequency keep on drifting inco-
herently. The discovery that an array of identical
oscillators, all coupled in an identical way to their
neighbors, can also be split into synchronized and
drifting groups was likewise surprising as funda-
mental. The chimera state, being a novel type
of dynamic state, can broaden our understand-
ing of transitions from synchrony to “turbulence”
and vice versa, and has possible realizations and
in neuroscience3,4 or
applications in nature, e.g.
hydrodynamics5,6. Since the pioneering works in
the early years of this millennium, chimera states
have been observed in many diﬀerent systems,
ranging from systems with non-local coupling7–11,
via two-group approximations12,13 to global all-
to-all coupling14,15. Due to their robustness to
noise, chimera states have also been observed ex-
perimentally, e.g.
in networks of coupled chem-
ical oscillators13, arrays of coupled spatial light
modulators8, networks of mechanical oscillators16
and electrochemical systems14. However, the
various systems diﬀer strongly in the visual at-

tributes of their dynamic behavior, asking for a
systematic categorization. In this paper, we pro-
pose a classiﬁcation scheme based on linear meth-
ods, which we believe fulﬁlls the requirements of
being universal and simple in its application.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Most early studies on chimera states dealt with non-
locally coupled phase oscillators, where coherence refers
to phase- and frequency-locked oscillators and incoher-
ence to drifting oscillators, respectively1. Lately, more
and more chimera patterns were discovered where co-
herence and incoherence was of a diﬀerent nature. One
example is a coupled-map chimera, where the individual
elements consist of period-two orbits. There, the coex-
istence pattern is composed of two synchronous regions
corresponding to the two realizations of the period-two
orbit, with a spatially incoherent interfacial region, where
the spatial arrangement of the two states appear in a
random and thus incoherent manner8. Yet, each state
remains a period-2 orbit in time and is thus either syn-
chronized or anti-synchronized to any of the other ele-
ments, preserving temporal order. Another example is
the so-called amplitude chimera, where the incoherent
group is characterized by disorder in the amplitude of
the oscillators while all the oscillators in the entire en-
semble oscillate with the same frequency11. Other co-
herence/incoherence coexistence patterns diﬀer from the
classical chimera state by the variability of coherent and
incoherent regions, which might both change their sizes
and move in space17,18. Furthermore, the stability prop-
erties of these diverse chimera states vary greatly. While
many chimeras, among them the original one in systems
of nonlocally coupled phase oscillators, are transient for a
ﬁnite number of oscillators, but stable in the continuum
limit N → ∞19, others are stable already from small en-

semble sizes on20,21, or they remain transient even in the
continuum limit11.

These examples illustrate that the original deﬁnition of
a chimera state as “a spatio-temporal pattern in which
a system of identical oscillators is split into coexisting
regions of coherent and incoherent oscillators”22 does
not cope with recent developments but calls for a more
distinct characterization and reﬁnement. There already
exist two approaches towards characterization schemes
in minimal networks20 and for chimeras with non-local
coupling23, but they are both restricted to a small class
of systems.

In this paper we propose two measures for character-
izing chimera states. Although based on linear meth-
ods, these quantities allow what we believe to be a clear
and simple deﬁnition of chimera states, and, furthermore,
they allow for an easy distinction between chimera states
with diﬀerent coherence properties and thus provide a
useful classiﬁcation scheme.
In addition, our approach
is independent of the coupling scheme and the spatial
dimension of the system.

The paper is structured as follows: In section II we in-
troduce a spatial and a temporal correlation measure ap-
plicable to arbitrary data sets and deﬁne chimera states
with the help of these measures.
In section III, these
criteria are applied to experimental and simulated data
of diﬀerent chimera states, and in section IV a detailed
characterization scheme on the basis of the measures is
discussed. Details pertaining to the individual systems
and to the numerical methods are given in the Supple-
mentary Information.

II. CORRELATION MEASURES FOR SPATIAL AND
TEMPORAL COHERENCE

A. A measure for correlation in space

For systems with a spatial extent, that is, systems with
a local or non-local coupling topology, we employ the
local curvature as a measure for the spatial coherence.
Hereby the local curvature of the observable is quanti-
ﬁed by the second derivative in one-dimension, or, more
generally, by the Laplacian for any number of spatial di-
mensions. Therefore, we calculate the local curvature at
each point in space by re-scaling and applying the dis-
crete Laplacian D on each snapshot containing the spa-
tial data f . For one snapshot at time t with one spatial
dimension, this operation reads

ˆDf = ∆x2Df

= f (x + ∆x, t) − 2f (x, t) + f (x − ∆x, t) ,

(1)

where each data point in f can be either real, complex
or of any higher dimension. In order to clarify this con-
cept, consider the chimera state observed by Kuramoto
and Battogtokh in a ring of non-locally coupled phase
oscillators1. One realization of the chimera state is de-
picted in ﬁgure 1a. Through the application of the dis-

2

conditions decayed. (b) Absolute value of the local curvature

data set shown in (a).

crete Laplace operator, this snapshot is mapped onto a
new function as shown in ﬁgure 1b, with Dm indicating
the maximal value of | ˆD|. Note that for phase oscillator
systems, we apply this operator on the data in the com-
plex plane, that is the phase oscillators are located on a
ring with constant amplitude A. Then, Dm corresponds
to the curvature at an oscillator whose two neighbors
are shifted 180◦ in phase, i.e., whose neighboring oscilla-
tors are located on opposite positions on the circle. With
the re-scaling obtained by multiplying the Laplacian with
∆x2 in Eq. (1), Dm converges to 4A in the continuum
limit. In the synchronous regime limN→∞ | ˆD| = 0. This
means that the synchronous regime is projected onto the
x-axis through this transformation, while in the incoher-
ent regime | ˆD| is ﬁnite and exhibits pronounced ﬂuctu-
ations. Consequently, when we consider the normalized
probability density function g of | ˆD|, g(| ˆD| = 0) mea-
sures the relative size of spatially coherent regions in
each temporal realization. For a fully synchronized sys-
tem g(| ˆD| = 0) = 1, while a totally incoherent system
gives a value g(| ˆD| = 0) = 0. A value between 0 and
1 of g(| ˆD| = 0) indicates coexistence of synchrony and
incoherence.
Given this discussion, two important aspects have to
be considered. First, the deﬁnition of spatial coherence
and incoherence is not absolute, but has to be compared
to the maximal curvature in each system. Thus, we argue
that the characterization of coherence and incoherence is
relative and depends on the individual system. Second,
even in the coherent region, there might be some minor
change in state (cf. ﬁgure 1a above) leading to a non-
zero curvature. Hence, we are convinced that in order
to characterize something as coherent or incoherent, a
threshold value is inevitable, although, as will be shown
later, the exact position of the threshold does not change
the qualitative outcome.

Considering the two arguments above, we propose that
for spatially extended systems, a point for which the ab-
solute local curvature is less than one percent of the max-
imum curvature present in the system should be charac-
terized as coherent, and as incoherent otherwise.

(2)

can be used to describe the spatial extent occupied by co-
herent oscillators, even for systems beyond coupled phase
oscillators. An example of g for the Kuramoto model is
shown in ﬁgure 2a. Note that, in general, g is time depen-
dent. Figure 2b shows g0(t) as a function of time. The
value of g0(t) of about 0.3 conﬁrms the interpretation of
the state as a chimera state, while its time-independence
reveals that the degree of coherence is stationary.

Laplace operator applied on the snapshot of ﬁgure 1a. (b)
Temporal evolution of g0(t) for a longer time series of the
Kuramoto model.

For systems without a spatial dimension, i.e., systems
with solely global coupling, curvature is not deﬁned.
Nevertheless, we argue that the pairwise Euclidean dis-
tances between the values of all oscillators, fi,

˜D = { ˜Dij} = (cid:107)fi − fj(cid:107) , i (cid:54)= j,

(3)

are a good measure for synchrony/asynchrony. Again,
from the normalized probability density function g of ˜D,
a variable

(cid:113)(cid:82) δ

˜g0(t) :=

0g(t,| ˜D|)d| ˜D|,

(4)

can be obtained that is a measure for the relative amount
of correlated oscillators. Here, the square root arises due
to the fact that by taking all pairwise distances, the prob-
ability of oscillators i and j both being in the synchronous
cluster equals (N0/N )2, with N0 being the number of the
synchronous oscillators. Since both measures, g0(t) and
˜g0(t), describe the same property, that is, the degree of
spatial synchronization of the system, we only use g0(t)
as notation in the following.

As an illustration, consider the two groups of glob-
ally coupled phase oscillators investigated by Abrams et
al12. An exemplary snapshot is depicted in ﬁgure 3a,
where oscillators 1, . . . , N/2 belong to group 1 and os-
cillators N/2 + 1, . . . , N constitute group 2. Clearly,
group 1 is synchronous while the oscillators in group
2 behave incoherently. In the parameter region consid-
ered, a breathing of the chimera as expressed through an
oscillation of the variance of the incoherent cluster was

reported12. The temporal evolution of g0(t) is shown in
ﬁgure 3b.
It can be observed that g0(t), i.e., the rela-
tive amount of partially synchronized oscillators, evolves
periodically and ’breathes’ over time. Therefore, the
temporal evolution of g0(t) allows for the discrimination
between chimeras with constant and oscillating partial
synchronization, which we term stationary and breathing
chimeras, respectively, whereby the latter term has been
adapted from the literature12. Note that the two ap-
proaches above are independent of the spatial dimension
and the number of variables of the diﬀerent systems. This
makes g0(t) a versatile tool for the classiﬁcation of mul-
tifaceted data sets such as those obtained from chimera
states.

B. A measure for correlation in time

In addition to the measure for the spatial correlation
discussed in the previous section, the temporal correla-
tion of the individual oscillators provides valuable infor-
mation for a distinction between diﬀerent chimera dy-
namics as well. Suppose Xi and Xj are the real or com-
plex time series of two individual oscillators with µi, µj
and σi, σj their respective means and standard devia-
tions. Then, consider the pairwise correlation coeﬃcients

ρij = (cid:104)(Xi − µi)∗ (Xj − µj)(cid:105)

σiσj

(5)

with (cid:104)·(cid:105) indicating the temporal mean and ∗ complex
conjugation. Note that ρij = 1 for linearly correlated
time series, ρij = −1 for linearly anti-correlated time
series and |ρij| = 1, ∠ρij = α for complex time series with
a constant phase shift of α. That means, the normalized
distribution function h of

ˆR = {|ρij|} , i (cid:54)= j

(6)

is a measure for the correlation in time. For static
chimera states, where the coherent cluster is localized
at the same position over time, h(|ρij| ≈ 1) is non-zero.
In practice, we consider two oscillators as correlated if
|ρij| > 0.99 = γ. As an example, consider the Kuramoto

the complex plane with arbitrary constant amplitude A
for all oscillators. Then, for the chimera state depicted
in ﬁgure 4a, we calculate the correlation matrix ˆR and
its probability distribution function h. The ﬁrst row of
ˆR, {ρ0x}, is shown in ﬁgure 4b. Note that this approach
maps the temporally coherent part onto 1, cf. ﬁgure 4b.
The distribution function h is depicted in ﬁgure 5a. It

exhibits a distinct peak at |ρ| = 1, indicating that the
chimera state is static, i.e., that the majority of oscilla-
tors does not change its “group aﬃliation”. We suggest
to term this kind of chimera state a static chimera. The
peak at |ρ| ≈ 0.5 arises due to the partial linear corre-
lation between oscillators at x ≈ 0.5 and synchronous
oscillators, cf. ﬁgure 4b. The percentage of the time-
correlated oscillators can now be quantiﬁed with

(cid:113)(cid:82) 1

h0 :=

γh(|ρ|)d|ρ|,

(7)

e.g. h0 ≈ √0.08 ≈ 0.28 for the Kuramoto model, coin-

ciding in this case, i.e., the case of a static chimera, with
g0(t), see ﬁgure 5b.

Note that h0 does not always reﬂect the size of the
synchronized cluster. This is especially the case when

4

coherent and incoherent regimes are non-static and per-
form spatial movements over time. Then, h0 is much
smaller than g0(t) and may vanish for large enough time
windows.

III. EXAMPLES OF CHIMERA STATES AND THEIR
CHARACTERIZATION

As shown in the previous section, g0(t) of the Ku-
ramoto model remains constant in time and, in addition,
coincides with h0. This indicates the constant phase rela-
tion between the coherent and incoherent part and their
spatial stationarity in time. The same qualitative behav-
ior can be observed in many diﬀerent non-locally cou-
pled dynamical systems, such as in non-locally coupled
Stuart-Landau oscillators investigated by Bordyugov et
al.7 and in chimera states observed by Sethia and Sen in
a non-locally coupled version of the complex Ginzburg-
Landau equation (CGLE)10. A snapshot and the observ-
ables g0(t) and h0 of the latter are depicted in ﬁgure 6a
and b, respectively. If h0 is larger than 0, independent of

(b) g0(t) and h0 of the amplitude-

the size of the regarded time frame, then one can conclude
that the chimera state is stationary in the sense that the
incoherent and synchronous patches do not move. Ac-
cording to our deﬁnition above, this chimera state is a
static chimera. Moreover, the ﬁnite values of g0(t) and
h0 indicate that the desynchronized dynamics are both
spatially and temporally incoherent.

An example of a static chimera state not exhibiting
temporal incoherence was examined by Hagerstrom et al.
in a system of non-locally coupled maps with a period-2
orbit8. As depicted in ﬁgure 7a, the individual realiza-
tions are located on two stable branches. As evident from
ﬁgure 7b, for these chimeras g0(t) is constant and smaller
than 1, while h0 equals 1. The value of g0(t) between 0
and 1 aﬃrms that we are dealing with a chimera state,
while the fact that h0 = 1 attests to the absence of any
temporal incoherence.

As already mentioned in the previous section, the tem-
poral evolution of g0(t) can be used to identify diﬀer-
ent dynamic behaviors of chimera states. Apart from
being constant, g0(t) can oscillate in time for a breath-

irregular phase boundaries were also reported by Bordyu-
gov et al.7, who named this state a turbulent chimera.
We adapt this expression for general chimera states with
irregular variation of the partial synchronization, g0(t).
Dynamics resembling the type I chimera in some as-
pects is the spatio-temporal intermittency as observed
in the CGLE24. A realization of the spatio-temporal in-

tion of the absolute value of the complex amplitude and
the observables g0(t) and h0 are depicted in ﬁgure 8a and
b, respectively. In ﬁgure 8b, the oscillatory behavior of
g0(t) is evident, indicating partial synchronization also in
the incoherent regime. Note that within the incoherent
cluster, there are always homogeneous patches, leading
to the oﬀset between g0(t) and h0.

Besides oscillating in time, the observable g0(t) can
also vary irregularly. Such a behavior can be observed
in the so-called type I chimera in the CGLE with linear
global coupling18. A representative evolution of the mod-
ulus of the complex amplitude W and the corresponding
measures g0(t) and h0 are depicted in ﬁgure 9a and b,
respectively. Note that h0 is signiﬁcantly larger than 0,
indicating that the chimera state is static. The irregu-
larity in g0(t) arises from spatio-temporal intermittency,
which appears spontaneously in the turbulent regime,
leading to the emergence of patches of oscillators that
are synchronous with the coherent region and shrink and
disappear with time. Non-stationary chimera states with

FIG. 10. (a) Temporal evolution of the modulus of the com-
plex amplitude of the one-dimensional CGLE showing spatio-
temporal intermittency24. (b) g0(t) and h0 calculated from
the data shown in (a).

termittency in the one-dimensional CGLE is shown in
ﬁgure 10a. In ﬁgure 10b, the irregular evolution of g0(t)
is apparent. However, in contrast to the type I chimera
discussed above, g0(t) drops to zero at diﬀerent points
in time. This means that the coherent part, and with
it the coexistence between synchrony and incoherence,
vanishes completely from time to time. Therefore, spatio-
temporal intermittency should not be considered to rep-
resent a chimera state. h0 is also small (< 0.05), and
results from the correlation of neighboring points due to
diﬀusion.

Dynamics with reversed roles, that is turbulent patches
appearing in an otherwise homogeneous regime, are
found in the CGLE with linear17 and non-linear global
coupling18 and is called localized turbulence. An example
is shown in ﬁgure 11, with a snapshot of the modulus of a

A. Transient chimeras

6

So far, we did not consider the long-term stability of
the chimera states yet. However, especially in the context
of chimera states, deﬁning a stability concept is an im-
portant issue. While various chimera states, as the type
I and type II chimeras mentioned above, are the only at-
tractors for a speciﬁc parameter region, and as such are
stable, many other chimera states including those of the
Kuramoto model, turn out to be long-term transients.
Still, it could be shown that they become stable in the
continuum limit N → ∞19. Then, there exist states
encompassing coexistence of coherence and incoherence
that are not stable for N → ∞. An example thereof is
the so-called amplitude chimera11. The space-time real-
ization of such a state is depicted in ﬁgure 13a, ﬁgure
13b showing the evolution of g0(t). Amplitude chimeras
resemble the chimeras found in coupled period-2 maps
(cf. ﬁgure 7) insofar as they are composed of two coher-
ent domains with anti-phase behavior that are separated
by a spatially incoherent interfacial region. In the latter
region, the absolute values of the amplitudes vary errati-
cally in space but each oscillator is strictly periodic with
a frequency equal to the frequency of the synchronous re-
gions. The spatial incoherence renders g0(t) smaller than
1. However, as investigated in detail by Loos et al.26 and
also evident from ﬁgure 13, the chimera-like dynamics are
not stable. A transition to full synchronization can be ob-
served, i.e. g0(t) = 1 after a ﬁnite time interval. In this
case, the lifetime of the chimera state strongly depends
on the choice of the initial conditions and asymptotically
approaches a constant value in the continuum limit26.

We consider it meaningful to discriminate between
transient chimeras and chimera states which are attrac-
tive in the continuum limit. Therefore we suggest to
introduce a separate class transient chimeras for states
with 0 < g0(t) < 1∀t < t0 and g0(t) = 1 ∨ g0(t) = 0 at
some transient time t0.

correlation measures g0(t) and h0, calculated from the
two-dimensional spatio-temporal data with system size
L = 200 are depicted in ﬁgure 12a. The ﬂuctuating value
of g0(t) suggests that the degree of coherence changes
with time. A strong increase of the synchronous part
occurs at t ≈ 1350, indicating a strong non-stationarity.
However, calculations with larger system sizes suggest
that the variations vanish in the thermodynamic limit
N → ∞. An illustration is depicted in ﬁgure 12b, where
g0(t) was calculated from two-dimensional simulations of
systems with L = 2000.

A characteristic feature of localized turbulence, as
compared to all chimera states discussed above, is that
the turbulent islands are composed of several incoherent
“bubble-like” structures, which move erratically in the
spatial domain. Bubbles disappear or pop up through
division of existing bubbles. Due to this steady motion
of the turbulent islands, the fraction of the coherent time
series, as measured by h0 is small, and vanishes if the
time window is chosen large enough. The same holds for
the alternating chimeras observed by Haugland et al.25,
where the turbulent part alternates with the homoge-
neous regime in time (not shown).

no turbulent bubbles ever disappear. A one-dimensional

B. Experimental observation of chimeras

Chimeras have also been observed in experimental
setups8,13,14. In this section, we apply our approach to
experimental data as described by Sch¨onleber et al30. In
this system, the thickness of a SiO2 layer on a Si-electrode
oscillates due to simultaneous electrochemical oxidation
and etching. Changes of the SiO2 thickness are measured
via ellipsometric imaging. A snapshot of a measurement
is depicted in ﬁgure 15a, with the color indicating the
thickness of the oxide layer. The experimental data was
processed using a moving average over the last 10 time
frames. The temporal evolution of a one-dimensional cut

mains with an approximately constant velocity that is
strongly dependent on the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D. This
non-stationarity manifests itself in the overall systemati-
cally declining behavior of g0(t). In such a case a longer
simulation time is necessary in order to verify that g0(t)
vanishes after a ﬁnite time interval, which was conﬁrmed
for the present case. Since it mediates a transition from
an unstable to a stable state, it fulﬁlls the above deﬁned
criteria for a transient chimera state. We thus classify it
accordingly.

is shown in ﬁgure 15b, where the homogeneous oscillation
of a small region in an otherwise inhomogeneously oscil-
lating background can be observed. Figure 16a shows the
pairwise correlation coeﬃcients of the cross-section with
a point inside the coherent cluster (here y = 80): a strong
linear correlation within this cluster and the diminishing
correlation with the remaining oscillators is evident. In
ﬁgure 16b, the behavior of g0(t) with time and the value
of h0 are shown. They are remarkably similar to the type
II dynamics as depicted in ﬁgure 8. Hence we can con-
clude that the observed experimental chimera is of the
breathing type. The smallness of h0 originates from the
fact that the coherent cluster is relatively small.

IV. CLASSIFICATION SCHEME

We demonstrated above that the correlation measure
g0(t) exhibits distinct qualitative types of temporal be-
havior for chimera states with visibly diﬀerent dynamic
features, and that this can be used to discriminate be-
tween chimeras, transient chimeras and other types of
dynamics, allowing for a simple and straightforward clas-
siﬁcation of chimera states. For g0(t) equal to 0 or 1, one
of the two phases, the coherent (g0(t) = 0) or incoher-
ent one (g0(t) = 1), does not exist. This contradicts the
requirement of ’coexistence’, and we argue that dynami-
cal states where this occurs should be diﬀerentiated from
chimera states. This includes spatio-temporal intermit-
tency, the turbulent patterns in the CO-model and the

amplitude-chimeras shown in ﬁgure 13. Yet, for the lat-
ter two, 0 < g0(t) < 1 is valid for a long time interval.
Therefore, we suggest that these states are categorized
as transient chimeras. In the case of intermittency, g0(t)
ﬂuctuates constantly, thereby attaining a value of 0 after
arbitrary periods of time.
It is therefore diﬀerentiated
from chimera states.

Chimera states, i.e. states with 0 < g0(t) < 1, can

then be classiﬁed into three groups:

1. Stationary chimeras: Chimera states with con-

stant coherent cluster size g0(t),

2. Turbulent chimeras: Chimera states where the

temporal evolution of g0(t) is irregular,

3. Breathing chimeras: States in which the behav-

ior of g0(t) is periodic.

Note that there might be some ambiguity in the assign-
ment to these sub-categories, since the boundaries be-
tween stationary/turbulent and turbulent/oscillatory are
rather ﬂuent.

Based on the temporal correlation measure h0, these

groups can be further divided into three subclasses:

(a) Static chimeras, in which the coherent cluster is
conﬁned to the same position in space over time.
That means, h0 is non-zero and independent of the
time window evaluated.

(b) Moving chimeras, where h0 vanishes if the regarded

time window is taken suﬃciently large.

(c) Time-coherent chimeras, that is chimera states

with no temporal incoherence and thus h0 = 1.

These criteria are summarized in a chimera classiﬁcation
scheme shown in ﬁgure 17. The examples discussed in
the last two sections are assigned accordingly in the clas-
siﬁcation tree.

In conclusion, we have introduced two observables,
g0(t) and h0, that are a measure for the degree of spatial
and temporal coherence, respectively, and allow for a dis-
crimination between diﬀerent types of chimeras from sim-
ulated or experimental spatio-temporal data sets. All ex-
amples from literature considered here could be assigned
to one of the classes. Yet, it is likely that future studies
will reveal that the classiﬁcation is not complete. How-
ever, even in this case, the classiﬁcation scheme should
present a useful base skeleton that can be expanded as
new discoveries will dictate.
