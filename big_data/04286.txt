1. Introduction

which evolve by any positive power of their Gauss curvature K.

We consider a family of complete non-compact strictly convex hypersurfaces Σt embedded in Rn`1
Given a complete and strict convex hypersurface Σ0 embedded in Rn`1, we let F0 : Mn Ñ Rn`1 be
an immersion with F0pMnq “ Σ0. For a given number α ą 0, we say that an one-parameter family of
immersions F : Mn ˆ p0, Tq Ñ Rn`1 is a solution of the α-Gauss curvature ﬂow, if for each t P p0, Tq,
FpMn, tq “ Σt is a complete and strictly convex hypersurface embedded in Rn`1, and Fp¨, tq satisﬁes

where Kpp, tq is the Gauss curvature of Σt at Fpp, tq and (cid:126)npp, tq is the interior unit normal vector of Σt at
the point Fpp, tq.

The evolution of compact hypersurfaces by the α-Gauss curvature ﬂow is widely studied. The case
α “ 1 corresponds to the classical Gauss curvature ﬂow which was ﬁrst introduced by W. Firey in [14]
and later studied by K. Tso in [21]. Other works include those in [1, 9, 10, 11, 15]. The power case was
studied by B. Chow in [8] and also in the works [2, 3, 4, 16, 17].

In [11] the optimal regularity of viscosity solutions of (˚α), which are not necessarily strictly convex,

was studied. These results are local and apply to both compact or non-compact settings.

In this work we will assume that the initial surface Σ0 is a complete convex graph over a domain
Ω Ă Rn, that is Σ0 “ tpx, u0pxqq : x P Ωu for some function u0 : Ω Ñ R. The domain Ω may be
In particular, the case where Σ0 is an entire graph over Rn will be included.
bounded or unbounded.
Since the regularity results of [11] apply in this setting as well, we will be mostly concerned here with the
questions of existence rather than those of regularity and we have chosen to take a more classical approach
to the problem and assume that the initial hypersurface Σ0 is locally uniformly convex. Our local a priori
estimates will guarantee that the solution is locally uniformly convex for all t ą 0 and therefore it becomes
instantly smooth independently from the regularity of the initial data. In the case of a compact initial data
this result was shown in [1, 3].

K. Ecker and G. Huisken in [12, 13] studied the evolution of entire graphs by Mean curvature. In
particular, it was shown in [13] that in some sense the Mean curvature ﬂow on entire graphs behaves
better than the heat equation on Rn, namely an entire graph solution exists for all time independently from

the growth of the initial surface at inﬁnity. The initial entire graph is assumed to be only locally Lipschitz.
This result is based on a clever local gradient estimate which is then combined with the evolution of |A|2
(the square sum of the principal curvatures) to give a local bound on |A|2, independent from the behavior
of the solution at spatial inﬁnity. The latter is achieved by adopting the well known technique of Caﬀarelli,
Nirenberg and Spruck in [6] in this geometric setting. More recently, S´aez and Schn¨urer [19] showed the
existence of complete solutions of the Mean curvature ﬂow for an initial hypersurface which is a graph
Σ0 “ tpx, u0pxqq : x P Ω0u over a bounded domain Ω0, and u0pxq Ñ `8 as x Ñ BΩ0.

An open question between the experts in the ﬁeld is whether the techniques of Ecker and Huisken in
[12, 13] can be extended to the fully-nonlinear setting and in particular on entire convex graphs evolving
by the α-Gauss curvature ﬂow. In this work we will show that this is the case as our main result shows.
Theorem 1.1. Let Σ0 “ tpx, u0pxqq : x P Ωu be a locally uniformly convex (deﬁned below) graph given
by a function u0 : Ω Ñ R deﬁned on a convex open domain Ω Ă Rn such that

Remark 1.3 (General initial data). Given a complete and locally uniformly convex hypersurface Σ0 em-
bedded in Rn`1, there exist an orthogonal matrix A P Opn ` 1q, a vector Y0 P Rn`1 and a function
u0 : Ω Ñ R such that AΣ0 ` Y0 (cid:66) tY0 ` AX : X P Σ0u “ tpx, u0pxqq : x P Ωu, and the conditions (i)-(iii)
in Theorem 1.1 hold. Thus, Theorem 1.1 shows the existence of a smooth strictly convex solution Σt of
(˚α) for any complete locally uniformly convex hypersurface Σ0.
Remark 1.4 (Translating solitons and asymptotic behavior). J. Urbas in [22] studies complete noncompact
convex solutions of (˚α) which are self-similar. In particular he shows that for any α ą 1{2 and any
convex bounded domain Ω Ă Rn, there exists a translating soliton solution of (˚α) which is a graph over
Ω. Conversely, these are the only complete noncompact convex solutions of (˚α) for α ą 1{2 which
move by translation. On the other hand, he shows that for α P p0, 1{2s and any λ ą 0 there exist a entire
graph convex translating soliton solution of (˚α) which moves with speed λ. It would be interesting to
see whether these translating solitons appear as asymptotic limits, as t Ñ `8, of the solutions Σt to (˚α)
given by Theorem 1.1 in the corresponding range of exponents.

Discussion on the Proof : The proof of Theorem 1.1 mainly relies on two local a’priori estimates: a local
bound from below on the smallest principal curvature λmin of the solution Σt, given in Theorem 3.3, and
a local bound from above on the speed Kα of Σt, given in Theorem 4.1. Notice that the ﬁrst estimate
is used to control the speed Kα. The ﬁrst bound follows via a Pogolerov type computation involving
an appropriate cut-oﬀ function on Σt. The second bound uses the well known technique by Caﬀarelli,
Nirenberg and Spruck in [6] which was also used by Ecker and Huisken in the context of the Mean
curvature ﬂow in [13].

One of the challenges comes from the fact that the evolution equations of the position vector Fpp, tq
and its curvature have the diﬀerential linearized operators since Kα is not homogeneous of degree one for

the evolution of our cut oﬀ function ψ (equation (2.4)) has a reaction term which depends on the Gauss
curvature. To establish local curvature estimates we carefully control the reaction terms which appear
from the gap between the diﬀerential operators.

Another diﬃculty arises from the non-concavity of the equation (˚α). In the most challenging case
where nα ě 1, (˚α) is neither concave nor convex equation. In previous works [2, 4, 8, 16] which concern

4

with the compact case, global estimates on the smallest principal curvature λmin were shown by using the
support function on S n.

A brief outline of the paper is as follows: in section 2 we derive some basic equations under the α-Gauss
curvature ﬂow and also obtain our local gradient estimate. Sections 3 and 4 are devoted to our two crucial
local a’priori bounds, the lower bound on the principal curvatures and the upper bound on the speed Kα.
In the ﬁnal section we establish the all time existence of the ﬂow which is done in two steps: ﬁrst we show
the existence of a complete solution Σt on t P p0, Tq, where T “ TΩ depends on the domain Ω. Then, we
construct an appropriate barrier to guarantee that each Σt remains a graph over the same domain Ω, for all
t P p0, Tq, implying that T “ `8 independently from the domain Ω.

1.1. Notation. For the convenience of the reader, we summarize the following notation which will be
frequently used in what follows.

In particular, we denote ψ0 (cid:66) pM ´ ¯upp, tqq` by ψ for convenience.

Also, given a constant R ą 0 and a point Y P Rn`1, we deﬁne the cut-oﬀ functionsψ by

sψpp, tq “ pR2 ´ |Fpp, tq ´ Y|2q` “ maxtR2 ´ |Fpp, tq ´ Y|2, 0u

In this section we will derive some basic equations under the α-Gauss curvature ﬂow and also obtain a

local gradient estimate. We begin by showing some basic evolution equations.

Since (ii), (iii) in Theorem 1.1 imply that ψβ is compactly supported, for a ﬁxed T P p0,`8q, the function
ψβ υ attains its maximum on Mn ˆ r0, Ts at some pp0, t0q. If t0 “ 0, then we obtain the desired result.

3. Lower bounds on the principal curvatures

In this section we will obtain lower bounds on the principal curvatures, as stated in Theorem 3.3. We
will achieve this by using Pogorelov type estimates with respect to bii. Recall that bi j denotes the inverse
matrix of the second fundamental form hi j. Since bii depends on charts, we will ﬁnd the relation between
bii and the principal curvatures as [7]. We begin with a simple observation holding on every smooth strictly
convex hypersurface which we prove here for the reader’s convenience.
Proposition 3.1 (Euler’s formula). Let Σ be a smooth strictly convex hypersurface and F : Mn Ñ Rn`1
be a smooth immersion with FpMnq “ Σ. Then, for all p P Mn and i P t1,¨¨¨ , nu, the following holds

Remark 3.2. In [8], Chow obtained lower bounds on the principal curvatures of a closed solution Σt of
(˚1{n) by applying the maximum principle for ¯∇ξ ¯∇ξS ` ¯gξξS where Sp¨, tq is the support function of Σt,
and ¯∇ is a covariant derivative compatible with a metric ¯g of the unit sphere S n. See also [2, 4, 16]. Notice
that the eigenvalues of ¯∇i ¯∇ jS ` ¯gi jS with respect to ¯gi j are the principal radii of curvature as those of bi j,
and the maximum principle also apply for bξξ{gξξ if Σt is a closed solution. However, gi j depends on time
t while ¯gi j does not.

We will next show a local lower bound on the principal curvatures of Σt in terms of the initial data,
which constitutes one of the crucial estimates in this work. We recall the deﬁnition of the cut-oﬀ function
ψβpp, tq (cid:66) pM ´ βt ´ ¯upp, tqq`, where ¯upp, tq (cid:66) xFpp, tq, (cid:126)en`1y denotes the height function.
Theorem 3.3 (Local lower bound for the principal curvatures). Assume that a smooth hypersurface Σ0
satisﬁes the assumptions in Theorem 1.1 and let Σt be a complete strictly convex smooth graph solution
of (˚α) deﬁned on Mn ˆ r0, Ts, for some T ą 0. Then, given constants β ą 0 and M ě β, the following
holds

Proof. Consider the cut-oﬀ function ψβ (cid:66) pM´βt´ ¯upp, tqq`, where ¯upp, tq “ xFpp, tq, (cid:126)en`1y denotes the
height function. Observe that the conditions (ii), (iii) in Theorem 1.1 imply that ψβ is compactly supported.
Therefore, for a ﬁxed T P p0,`8q, the function ψ
min attains its maximum on Mn ˆ r0, Ts at a
λ´1
point pp0, t0q. If t0 “ 0, then we obtain the desired result by the bound ψβ ď M and the conditions on our
initial data. So, we may assume in what follows that t0 ą 0.

5. Long time existence

In this ﬁnal section, we will establish the all time existence of the complete non-compact α-Gauss
curvature ﬂow (˚α), as stated in our main Theorem 1.1. Our proof will be based on the a’priori estimates
in sections 2-4, and the proof will be done in two steps. We will ﬁrst show, in the next Theorem, the
existence of a complete solution Σt on t P p0, Tq, where T “ TΩ depends on the domain Ω. We will then
construct an appropriate barrier to guarantee that each Σt remains as a graph over the same domain Ω, for
all t P p0, Tq, implying that T “ `8 independently from the domain Ω.
Theorem 5.1. Let Ω, u0 and Σ0 satisfy the conditions in Theorem 1.1. Assume BRpx0q Ă Ω, for some
R ą 0. Then, given an immersion F0 : Mn Ñ Rn`1 with F0pMnq “ Σ0, there is a solution F : Mn ˆ
p0, Tq Ñ Rn`1 of (˚α) for some T ě pnα`1qRnα`1 such that for each t P p0, Tq, the image Σt (cid:66) FpMn, tq
is a strictly convex smooth complete graph of a function up¨, tq : Ωt Ñ R deﬁned on a convex open Ωt Ă Ω,
and also up¨, tq and Ωt satisfy the conditions of u0 and Ω in Theorem 1.1.

We begin with some extra notation.

Notation 5.2. We have:

(i) Given a set A P Rn`1, we denote by ConvpVq its convex hull ttx ` p1 ´ tqy : x, y P A, t P r0, 1su.
(ii) Let Σ be a convex complete (either non-compact or closed) hypersurface. If a set V is a subset of

ConvpΣq, we say V is enclosed by Σ and use the notation

In particular, if V

(iii) For a convex smooth hypersurface Σ with a point X P Σ, we denote by KpΣqpXq the Gauss

(iv) For a convex complete graph Σ with a point X P Σ, we deﬁne ¯upΣqpXq and υminpΣqpXq by

where (cid:126)nL is the upward unit normal vector of a hyperplane L.

(viii) For r ą 0 and px0, t0q P Rn ˆp0,`8q, Qrppx0, t0qq (cid:66) Brpx0qˆpt0 ´ r2, t0s denotes the parabolic
cube centered at px0, t0q, where Brpx0q is the n-ball of radius r centered at x0 P Rn. Also, for
β P p0, 1q, Cβ,β{2
pQrq denotes the standard H¨older space with respect to the parabolic distance.
In the proof of Theorem 5.1 we will use a standard Schauder estimate for equation (˚˚α). However,
since (˚˚α) is not a concave equation we cannot directly use the known regularity theory. To detour this
diﬃculty, we slightly modify the standard C2,β estimate of G. Tian and X.-J. Wang in [20].
Proposition 5.3 (C2,β estimate). Let u : Qr Ñ R be a strictly convex and smooth solution of (˚˚α) with
Qr (cid:66) Qrppx0, t0qq. Then, there exist some β P p0, 1q such that for any σ P p0, 1q, we have

by Krylov-Safonov’s estimate in [18], as in Step 1 of the proof of Theorem 2.1 in [20]. Now, we transform
(˚˚α) into the following equation

Since pdet D2uq 1

D2up¨, tq for each t. Thus, H¨older estimate for D2u in t can be achieved in the same manner as in Step 2
(cid:3)
of the proof of Theorem 2.1 in [20].

We will now give the proof of the existence Theorem 5.1.

Proof of Theorem 5.1. We will obtain a solution Σt (cid:66) tpx, up¨, tqq : x P Ωt Ă Rnu as a limit

In addition, by (P1); u0pxq ď upx, tq,

Also, by applying the curvature lower bound, Theorem 3.3, and the speed bound, Theorem 4.1, we have

that actually upy, tq is C8 smooth. Thus, by (P2), we assure that Σt is the desired solution. This ﬁnishes
