EXISTENCE OF PERIODIC POINTS FOR SELF MAPS OF THE

ANNULUS.

J.IGLESIAS, A.PORTELA, A.ROVELLA AND J.XAVIER

Abstract. Consider a continuous surjective self map of the open annulus
with degree d > 1. It is proved that the number of Nielsen classes of periodic
points is maximum possible whenever f has a completely invariant essential
continuum. The same result is obtained in negative degree |d| > 1 and for just
forward invariant essential continua, provided that the continuum is locally
connected. We also deal with the problem of wether there is a representative
of each Nielsen class in the ﬁlled set of the invariant continuum. Moreover,
if the map extends continuously to the boundary of the annulus and both
boundary components are either attracting or repelling, the hypothesis on the
existence of the invariant continuum is no longer needed for obtaining all the
periodic points in the interior of the annulus.

1. Introduction.

This paper deals with the existence of periodic points for annulus maps. A map
is any continuous endomorphism of the open annulus A. The degree of an annulus
map f is the integer d such that f∗(n) = d.n, where f∗ is the endomorphism of the
fundamental group Π1(A) ∼ Z induced by f . We are particularly interested in the
case where the degree of the map has modulus greater than one.

We will consider two diﬀerent ways of saying that a map has abundance of
periodic orbits. The ﬁrst one is completeness, and is related to Nielsen equivalence.
The second one is the growth rate inequality which will be discussed shortly. A
map of the annulus is complete if for every n the number of Nielsen classes of ﬁxed
points of f n is equal to |dn − 1|. This is the maximum possible for a map of degree
d. Roughly speaking, a continuous map f : A → A of degree d, |d| > 1, is said to
be complete if it has as many diﬀerent Nielsen classes of periodic points as the map
zd acting on the circle. Nielsen equivalence and completeness are explained in the
next section.

This notion of completeness is related to a great deal of problems on existence of
periodic orbits in surface dynamics. For example, a complete map always satisﬁes
the growth rate inequality:

lim sup
n→∞

1
n

ln(#{Fix(f n)}) ≥ ln(d).

It is an open problem if the rate inequality holds for diﬀerentiable maps of degree

d acting on the sphere S2 (Problem 3 posed in [S]).

Other results related to the existence of periodic points for C 0 maps, (not neces-
sarily homeomorphisms) were obtained by Hagopian in [H], where some conditions
are imposed on plane continua in order to obtain the existence of ﬁxed points for
any C 0 map deﬁned on it.

Existence of recurrence is mostly present in maps with |d| > 1 because |d| > 1
implies an ’expansion’ on the direction of a simple nontrivial closed curve. This
idea will be used frequently throughout the article.
The covering map z → zd deﬁned in the annulus {z ∈ C : 0 < |z| < 1} is
a trivial example of a map without periodic points in the open annulus, and so
the mere existence of periodic orbits becomes of interest. As covering maps lift to
homeomorphisms of the plane, the problem also relates to surface homeomorphisms
dynamics, in particular with what is called Brouwer Theory. In [IPRX] complete-
ness of annulus coverings of degree d, |d| > 1, was proved under the assumption
that an essential continuum is preserved.

sarily coverings). Some deﬁnitions are needed before stating the results.

In this paper we study the same problem for general continuous maps (not nece-
We say that a map f : A → A is complete on K ⊂ A if f is complete and every
Nielsen class has a representative in K. Whenever K is a compact subset of the
(open) annulus, denote by Fill(K) the union of K with the bounded (relatively
compact) components of its complement.
Theorem 1. Let f : A → A be a surjective degree d map of the annulus, and K ⊂ A
an essential continuum such that f−1(K) = K. If d > 1, then f is complete on
Fill(K).

The ingredientes for the proof of this Theorem are Lefschetz Theory (to obtain
ﬁxed points enclosed by curves with nonzero index), Caratheodory Theory (con-
structions of crosscuts with determined properties) and Nielsen Theory (existence
of ﬁxed points in every Nielsen class is assured by proving that every lift of f to its
universal covering has a ﬁxed point).
The proof obtained fails for d < −1 and it is easy to construct counterexamples
of the proof. It is an open problem if the assertion of the Theorem is true also for
negative values of d.
The hypothesis f−1(K) = K is also important in the proof. Assuming that K
is locally connected, this assumption and the surjectivity of f can be dropped, and
a satisfactory conclusion is obtained.
Theorem 2. Let f : A → A be a degree d map of the annulus, and K ⊂ A a locally
connected essential continuum such that f (K) ⊂ K. If |d| > 1, then f is complete
on Fill(K).

These statements imply the existence of periodic points in the set Fill(K) and
there are examples where the periodic points are not contained in K. Posing some
conditions on the ’behaviour at inﬁnity’ of the map f , completeness is obtained
without any other assumption. To state these conditions, note that the annulus
can be compactiﬁed with two points, called ends of A.
Theorem 3. Let f : A → A be a degree d map of the annulus, where |d| > 1.
Assume that f extends continuously to the ends of A. Each one of the following
conditions imply that f is complete.

(1) Both ends of A are attracting.
(2) Both ends of A are repelling.

See sections 4,5 and 6 where completeness is obtained for maps of the annulus
under diﬀerent sets of hypothesis. In Section 2 the notion of Nielsen class is ex-
plained, in Section 3 the index and Lefschetz ﬁxed point Theorem are introduced

without proofs, and some of the lemmata needed in the proofs of the theorems
are included. Section 4 is devoted to the proof of Theorem 1.
In Section 5 the
proofs for locally connected K are given, and the last Section contains two simple
applications of these results to maps of the sphere.

2. Nielsen Theory.

Two ﬁxed points p and q of a map f : A → A are said Nielsen equivalent if
there exists a curve γ joining p to q such that f γ is homotopic to γ relative to its
endpoints. This is an equivalent relation whose classes are called Nielsen classes.
Two ﬁxed points that are very close are equivalent. Of course the existence of a
continuum of ﬁxed points gives just one class of Nielsen equivalent ﬁxed points. If
|d| > 1, then the map pd(z) = zd on the annulus A = C \ {0} has exactly |d − 1|
ﬁxed points, and also |d − 1| Nielsen classes.
It is not diﬃcult to see that a degree d map of the annulus cannot have more
than |d − 1| classes of ﬁxed points. A map f is complete if for every n the number
of Nielsen classes of ﬁxed points of f n is equal to that of the map pd. So, asking for
a map f to be complete is to ask that is has the maximum possible (non artiﬁcial)
periodic orbits. The following proposition is a standard result in Nielsen theory
(see Jiang’s book [J] for further information on the subject) and will be used to
prove all the results throughout this paper. Alternatively, you can see Corollary 1
in [IPRX].
Proposition 1. A degree d map of the annulus has |d − 1| Nielsen classes of ﬁxed
points if and only if any lift of f to the universal covering of the annulus has a ﬁxed
point.

Note that in order to prove completeness of a map f satisfying the hypothesis
of Theorem 1, Theorem 2 or Theorem 3, it suﬃces to show that any lift of f has a
ﬁxed point. Indeed, note that in any case, every iterate f k of f satisﬁes the same
hypothesis as f . It follows that f k has |dk − 1| classes of ﬁxed points.

3. The index.

Let Π : R2 → R2 \ {0}, deﬁned by Π(z) = exp(2πiz) denote the universal
covering of the punctured plane. The index of a plane closed curve γ deﬁned in an
interval I = [a, b] such that γ(t) (cid:54)= 0 for every t, is deﬁned as the ﬁrst coordinate
of γ(cid:48)(b) − γ(cid:48)(a), where γ(cid:48) is any lift of γ under Π: that is, γ(cid:48) : [a, b] → R2 is a curve
such that Π(γ(cid:48)(t)) = γ(t) for every t. This does not depend on the choice of the
lift. Note that the index is an integer.

We abuse notation and make no diﬀerence between the curve and its trace in

the plane.

Deﬁnition 1. Let γ be a closed curve and f a continuous map deﬁned on γ and
without ﬁxed points on γ. Deﬁne the Lefschetz index of f in γ as the index of the
closed curve f ◦ γ − γ. This index will be denoted by If (γ).

Let γ be a simple closed curve in the plane, so that its complement has two con-
nected components, one is bounded and denoted int(γ) and the other unbounded,
denoted ext(γ).
The curve γ is positively oriented if the index of t → γ(t) − p0 is 1 whenever p0
is a point that belongs to int(γ). If γ is positively oriented, then int(γ) is located
to the left of γ.

Lefschetz ﬁxed point Theorem. Let f be a continuous self-map of the plane.
(1) If γ is a simple closed curve such that If (γ) (cid:54)= 0, then f has a ﬁxed point

in the bounded component of R2 \ γ.
(2) Let A be an annulus in the plane whose boundary components are positively
oriented curves γ0 and γ1, and assume that If (γ0) (cid:54)= If (γ1), then f has a
ﬁxed point in A.

It is our prupose to use the above result to prove existence of periodic points.
We will need some techniques for calculating indexes of curves. The next assertion
follows by continuity of If (γ) on f and γ whenever the index is deﬁned.

Lemma 1. Assume that γ is a closed curve and that ft is a homotopy. If no ft
has a ﬁxed point in γ, then t → Ift(γ) is constant.
t → If (γt) is constant.

Moreover, if γt is a free homotopy and f has no ﬁxed points on any γt, then

The following is an immediate consequence:

the δ neighborhood of P ,

Corollary 1. Let f be ﬁxed point free on a simple closed curve γ. If P is a ﬁnite
subset of γ, then there exist  > 0 and δ > 0 such that the index of f(cid:48) on γ(cid:48) is equal
to the index of f in γ whenever the following conditions hold:
(1) γ(cid:48) is a simple closed curve such that (γ(cid:48) \ γ)∪ (γ \ γ(cid:48)) is contained in Vδ(P ),
(2) f(cid:48) is a continuous map such that f(cid:48) = f outside Vδ(P ),
(3) the image under f(cid:48) of Vδ(P ) is contained in V(f (P )).
The proof of this result follows from the fact that if  and δ are suﬃciently small,
then both f and f(cid:48) and γ and γ(cid:48) are homotopic. This previous corollary and the
following two criteria is all that is needed to calculate indexes in the sequel.

Assume that f is constant, equal to p and that γ is a positevely oriented simple
closed curve. The index If (γ) is equal to 1 if p belongs to int(γ), equal to 0 if p
belongs to ext(γ), and not deﬁned when p ∈ γ.

We proceed to generalize this statement.

Lemma 2. Let f be deﬁned on a positively oriented simple closed curve γ : [0, 1] →
R2. Let s be an open arc of γ and assume that the image of s is compactly contained
in int(γ). Assume also that f has no ﬁxed points on γ. Then, there exists a
homotopy {ft : 0 ≤ t ≤ 1} beginning at f = f0, and a time t(cid:48) ∈ (0, 1) such that the
following conditions hold:

(1) ft(s) ⊂ int(γ) for every t < t(cid:48).
(2) ft(s) ⊂ ext(γ) for every t > t(cid:48)
(3) ft(cid:48)(s) ⊂ s.
(4) For every t it holds that ft = f in γ \ s(cid:48) where s(cid:48) is an open arc compactly

containing s, and ft(s(cid:48)) ∩ γ ⊂ s.

In addition, for a homotopy satisfying all these properties, it holds that If0(γ) =

If1 (γ) + 1.
Proof. Let ht : R2 → R2 be a homotopy satisfying that h0 = id, h1 carries f (s) to
a point p contained in int(γ), and for every t it holds that ht(int(γ)) ⊂ int(γ) and
ht is the identity in a neighborhood U of the closure of ext(γ). Then ht ◦ f is a
homotopy begining at f , having no ﬁxed points on γ, and such that the ﬁnal map
has h1(f (s)) = p.

Figure 1.

So it can be assumed that f is constant in s, say f (s) = p0 ∈ int(γ). Next, let
p(t) be a curve deﬁned in [0, 1] such that p(0) = p0, p(t) ∈ int(γ) if t < 1/2, and
p(t) ∈ ext(γ) if t > 1/2 and p(1/2) ∈ s. Take an arc s(cid:48) containing s in its interior,
so that s(cid:48) \ s has two connected components whose images under f are contained
in the complement of U . Let ft be a homotopy beginning at f , such that following
three conditions hold: ft(s) = p(t), ft(s(cid:48)\ s)∩ (γ \ s) = ∅, and ft = f in γ \ s(cid:48). Then
the conditions of the lemma hold with t(cid:48) = 1/2. This proves the ﬁrst assertion of
the lemma.

It remains to prove that If0(γ) = If1(γ) + 1, the second assertion of the lemma.
It was explained above that ft can be assumed to be constant in s for every t. So
the problem reduces to estimate the jump of Ift(γ) when t passes through t(cid:48). The
construction made implies that no ft has ﬁxed points in γ \ s so that every ft can
be assumed to be equal to f in γ \ s(cid:48), where s(cid:48) is a small neighborhood of s whose
image under ft is contained in int(γ) for every t < t(cid:48).
Then the jump can be calculated as if s is the segment (−1, 1) contained in the
real axis, oriented from right to left, s(cid:48) is the arc (−2, 2) and the image of s changes
from the lower half plane to the upper one passing through the origin, while the
intersection of ft(s(cid:48)) with the real axis is contained in s, and f1 = f0 in the rest of
γ. Moreover, it may also be assumed that ft(s(cid:48)) is piecewise linear. See Figure 1.
In this case, the index change over s(cid:48) can be calculated directly from the deﬁnition.
(cid:3)

Analogously, we have:

Corollary 2. Let f be deﬁned on a positively oriented simple closed curve γ :
[0, 1] → R2. Let s be an open arc of γ and assume that the image of s is compactly
contained in int(γ). Assume also that f has no ﬁxed points on γ. Then, there exists
a homotopy {ft : 0 ≤ t ≤ 1} beginning at f = f0, and a time t(cid:48) ∈ (0, 1) such that
the following conditions hold:

(1) ft(s) ⊂ ext(γ) for every t < t(cid:48).

-2-112sfsf-2f2ss-2-112sf1srrr6

(2) ft(s) ⊂ int(γ) for every t > t(cid:48)
(3) ft(cid:48)(s) ⊂ s.
(4) For every t it holds that ft = f in γ \ s(cid:48) where s(cid:48) is an open arc compactly

containing s, and ft(s(cid:48)) ∩ γ ⊂ s.

In addition, for a homotopy satisfying all these properties, it holds that If0(γ) =

If1(γ) − 1.
Lemma 3. Let R ⊂ R2 be the square [−1, 1]2. Let f be deﬁned on ∂R such that:

• f ({y = 1}) ⊂ {y < 1},
• f ({y = −1}) ⊂ {y > −1},
• f ({x = 1}) ⊂ {x > 1},
• f ({x = −1}) ⊂ {x < −1}.

Then, If (γ) = −1, where γ is ∂R with the positive orientation.

Proof. Let ht(x, y) = (x, (1 − t)y), so that h0 is the identity and h1(x, y) = (x, 0).
Let ft = ht ◦ f . Then f0 = f and the hypotheses imply that no ft has ﬁxed points
in ∂R (for example, take any (x, 1) ∈ ∂R and let f (x, 1) = (u, v), then v < 1 implies
that ft(x, 1) = (u, (1 − t)v) and (1 − t)v < 1 for every t ∈ (0, 1)). Note that the
image of ∂R under f1 is contained in the line y = 0, and that the image of x = 1
is contained in x > 1 and the image of x = −1 contained in x < −1. It follows
from Corollary 2 that one can obtain a map f2 such that f2(∂R) is contained in
(cid:3)
the interior of R, so that 1 = If2(∂R) = If1(∂R) + 2 = If (γ) + 2.

Of course, the fact that R is a square is not essential in the hypothesis, and we

will use the lemma and remark above to calculate index of more general curves:

Corollary 3. Let α and β be disjoint simple proper lines in the plane, each one of
which separate the plane. Let γ and δ be another pair of disjoint curves separating
the plane. Assume also that each γ and δ intersect α in one point and β in one
point. Now let Γ be the simple closed curve determined by the four arcs of the
curves delimited by the intersection points, with the positive orientation. Now let
f be a map deﬁned on Γ such that f (Γ ∩ α) is contained in the component of the
complement of α that contains β, f (Γ ∩ β) is contained in the component of the
complement of β that contains α, that f (Γ ∩ δ) is contained in the component of
the complement of δ that does not contain γ and that f (Γ ∩ γ) is contained in the
component of the complement of γ that does not contain δ. Then the index of f in
Γ is equal to −1.
Proof. Note that there exists a homeomorphism H isotopic to the identity such that
H(α) = {y = 1}, H(β) = {y = −1}, H(γ) = {x = −1} and H(δ) = {x = 1}. Then
the map H ◦ f satisﬁes the hypothesis of Lemma 3 so −1 = IH◦f (∂R) = If (Γ). (cid:3)
Remark 1. If the last two items are changed to f ({x = 1}) ⊂ {x < −1} and
f ({x = −1}) ⊂ {x > 1}, then the conclusion is If (∂R) = 1. To prove that apply
the same homotopy and then observe that there exists f2 homotopic to f1 such that
f2(∂R) is contained in the interior of R, but now the homotopy from f1 to f2 has
no ﬁxed points in ∂R. The conclusion follows immediately.

As before, one obtains:

Corollary 4. Let α and β be disjoint simple proper lines in the plane, each one of
which separate the plane. Let γ and δ be another pair of disjoint curves separating

the plane. Assume also that each γ and δ intersect α in one point and β in one
point. Now let Γ be the simple closed curve determined by the four arcs of the
curves delimited by the intersection points, with the positive orientation. Now let
f be a map deﬁned on Γ such that f (Γ ∩ α) is contained in the component of the
complement of α that contains β, f (Γ ∩ β) is contained in the component of the
complement of β that contains α, that f (Γ ∩ δ) is contained in the component of
the complement of γ that does not contain δ and that f (Γ ∩ γ) is contained in the
component of the complement of δ that does not contain γ. Then the index of f in
Γ is equal to 1.

4. Proof of Theorem 1.

Theorem 1. Let f : A → A be a surjective map with degree d, K ⊂ A an essential
continuum such that f−1(K) = K. If d > 1, then f is complete on Fill(K).

As was already explained, it is suﬃcient to prove that every lift of f has a ﬁxed

point on the preimage of Fill(K) under the covering projection .
The proof will use indexes of curves, so it is convenient to interpret the annulus
as a subset of the plane. The map f will be considered as a map from A := R2\{S}
into itself, where S is the origin (called South; the other end of the annulus is ∞,
called North). The map f is assumed to have degree d, which is equivalent to
impose that the index of the closed curve t ∈ [0, 1] → f (exp(2πit)) is equal to d.
As K is essential, the complement of K in the annulus A = R2 \ {S} has two
distinguished connected components. The unbounded one is denoted AN , while AS
stands for the connected component of A \ K that accumulates on S. Note that
AS ∪ {S} is simply connected, thus Riemann’s Theorem implies that there exists a
conformal bijection h from AS ∪{S} to the unit disc D that carries S to the origin.
Remark 2. Note that as K is connected, then AN and AS are the unique compo-
nents of A \ K that are essential in A, while the others are simply connected. As
the degree of f is nonzero, the image under f of an essential open set is essential,
and as f−1(K) ⊂ K then f (AN ) is a subset of AS or a subset of AN . The same
can be said about AS. On the other hand, as f was assumed to be surjective, only
two possibilities remain: either f (AN ) ⊂ AN and f (AS) ⊂ AS or f (AN ) ⊂ AS and
f (AS) ⊂ AN . We will consider the two cases separately.

We will assume ﬁrst that each AS and AN are f -invariant.

4.1. Constructions in the annulus. We begin with some constructions of curves
in the annulus, this will not give the desired conclusions, not before lifting the curves
to the universal covering and calculating their index under a given lift F of f .

We will prove ﬁrst that f has ﬁxed points in the annulus. Assume by contradic-

tion that f has no ﬁxed point.
It will be convenient to recall some results from Caratheodory’s theory. Let Ω
be a simply connected region in the plane with a conformal bijection h : Ω → D.
A crosscut in Ω is a simple curve c contained in Ω except for its extreme points
which belong to the boundary of Ω. If h(c(t)) (cid:54)= 0 for every t, then the complement
of c in Ω has two connected components, one of which contains h−1(0); the other
one is denoted N (c). A point a in the boundary of Ω is accesible if there exists
an arc that is contained in Ω except for one extreme point in a. It is well known
that accesible points are dense in the boundary of Ω. Moreover, given two accesible
points there exists a crosscut in Ω whose extremes are the given points. Assume

8

J.IGLESIAS, A.PORTELA, A.ROVELLA AND J.XAVIER

that Ω is compact, (which in our case is obvious since AS ∪ {S} will stand for
Ω). Under this assumption, given a positive number δ, there exists a ﬁnite set
of accesible points, each one of them can be joined with another by a crosscut of
diameter less than δ. These crosscuts will be used to construct an essential simple
closed curve.
Let h be a conformal bijection from AS ∪ {S} to the unit disc carrying S to the
origin 0. It is claimed that for every suﬃciently small δ > 0, there exist a ﬁnite
sequence of crosscuts {ci : 1 ≤ i ≤ k} in AS such that

(C1) N (ci) ∩ N (cj) = ∅ whenever i (cid:54)= j.
(C2) γ = c1.c2 . . . ck is an essential positively oriented simple closed curve ,
(C3) each ci has diameter less than δ,
(C4) f (ci) ∩ ci = ∅.
(See ﬁgure 2 a).

(a)

(b)

Figure 2.

The proofs of the ﬁrst, second and third properties follow from the comments
above. To prove the last one, note that the contrary assumption implies that for
every suﬃciently small positive δn there exists a point xn in some crosscut cn of
diameter less than δn such that f (xn) ∈ cn, which implies that the distance from
f (xn) to xn is less than δn. An accumulation point of the sequence xn must belong
to the boundary of AS, that is contained in K, and must be a ﬁxed point of f ,
contrary to our assumption.

Except for the extreme points of the crosscuts, the remaining points of γ are
contained in the region AS. By assumption in Remark 2, f carries AS to itself.
Thus the curve f (γ) is contained in AS excepting for the images of the extreme
points of the crosscuts, that are also contained in K. Note that the image of a
crosscut is not necessarily a crosscut.

Let P be the intersection of γ with K. P is ﬁnite and by Corollary 1 there exists
 > 0 and δ > 0 such that one can modify f in the δ neighborhood of P arbitrarily,
whenever the image of the perturbation is still contained in the  neighborhood of

f (P ). Using the fact that AS ∪ {S} is conformally equivalent to the unit disc, it is
possible to construct a curve in AS that is as close to the boundary of AS as wished.
With this in mind, let α be a simple closed curve contained in AS that is close to
the boundary of AS in such a way that the intersection of α with γ only occurs in
Vδ(P ) and that the intersection of α with f (γ) is contained in V(f (P )). In order
to calculate the index of f in γ, we apply Corollary 1 and we may assume that γ
and f (γ) are both contained in the closure of Aα
S, the connected component of the
complement of α that contains S. Therefore it can be assumed (for the purposes
of index calculation) that the boundary of AS is a simple closed curve α, of course,
essential in the annulus A.
The next step consists in changing f to a homotopic map f(cid:48) in order to obtain
that f(cid:48)(γ) ∩ γ = ∅. In the process, the index will change, but by means of Lemma
2 and Lemma 3 the diﬀerence between If (γ) and If(cid:48)(γ) will be easily calculated.

f (ci) ⊂ N (ci), or f (ci) ∩ N (ci) = ∅.

Using Property (C4), there are two possibilities remaining for each ci: either
Assume that f (ci) ⊂ N (ci). The image under f of the arc ci is contained in
ext(γ); a direct application of Lemma 2 implies that the map f is homotopic to
a map f(cid:48)
(γ) = If (γ) + 1 as γ is positively
oriented.
If there were exactly J of the crosscuts ci satisfying f (ci) ⊂ N (ci), then change f
by a map f(cid:48) such that f(cid:48)(ci) ∩ N (ci) = ∅ and If(cid:48)(γ) = If (γ) + J. Moreover f(cid:48) is
equal to f outside a small neighborhood of each ci.
Now use f(cid:48) instead of f . Note that, even if f(cid:48)(cj) ∩ N (cj) = ∅ for every j, it may
very well happen that f(cid:48)(cj) ∩ γ (cid:54)= ∅.
S be the connected component of A\γ containing S. Let Rt be a deforma-
tion retract of Aα
S to γS be such that a point in N (ci) is sent under application of
R1 to a point in the interior of the arc ci and such that Rt(N (ci)) ⊂ N (ci) for all
t. Note that Rt ◦ f(cid:48) cannot have ﬁxed points in γ because for a point x in cj it is
known that f(cid:48)(x) does not belong to the closure of N (cj). It follows that the index
of R0 ◦ f(cid:48) = f(cid:48) and the index of R1 ◦ f(cid:48) with respect to the curve γ are equal. Note
that the image of γ under R1 ◦ f(cid:48) is contained in the closure of int(γ), so a small C 0
perturbation f(cid:48)(cid:48) of R1 ◦ f(cid:48) does not change the index and satisﬁes f(cid:48)(cid:48)(γ) ⊂ int(γ)
and If(cid:48)(cid:48) (γ) = 1.

Let Aγ

In conclusion, the following assertion was proved.

Corollary 5. There exists a map f(cid:48) homotopic to f such that f(cid:48) = f in K and all
the components of the complement of K other than AS. Moreover, it holds that

where J is the number of crosscuts ci satisfying f (ci) ⊂ N (ci).

If (γ) + J = If(cid:48)(γ) = 1,

Now, we want to explain brieﬂy what happens if the construction like that of γ
and the map f(cid:48) is done in AN , the unbounded component of the complement of
K containing N . Now AN ∪ {N} gives a simply connected region and there exists
a Riemann map carrying AN ∪ N to the unit disc and N to 0. The construction
of a curve γN by concatenation of crosscuts of AN satisfying the properties (C1)
to (C4) is the same as above. Now the component N (ci) of a crosscut ci is the
bounded component of the complement of ci in AN . Observe in addition that if the
curve γ is positively oriented, then a point in N (ci) is located in int(γ), therefore

10

J.IGLESIAS, A.PORTELA, A.ROVELLA AND J.XAVIER

by Lemma 2 If (ci) = If(cid:48)(ci) + 1 whenever ci is a crosscut such that f (ci) ⊂ N (ci)
and f(cid:48) is homotopic to f and constructed exactly as in the previous part. The
construction of the curve α is analogous in this case. The only diﬀerence appears
when calculating If(cid:48)(γ):
Corollary 6. There exists a map f(cid:48) homotopic to f such that f(cid:48) = f in K and all
the components of the complement of K other than AN . Moreover, it holds that

If (γ) − J(cid:48) = If(cid:48)(γ) = d,

where J(cid:48) is the number of crosscuts ci such that f (ci) is contained in N (ci) and
γ = c1.c2. . . . cn with the positive orientation.

Proof. It remains to see why If(cid:48)(γ) = d, but this is a simple calculation based on
the fact that γ is a simple closed curve nontrivial in the annulus, that f(cid:48)(γ) has
(cid:3)
index d and is contained in the unbounded component of γ.

Assuming that d > 0, the conclusion is the following:

Corollary 7. Let f be a map of the annulus of positive degree d > 1. If K is an
essential compact subset of the annulus such that f−1(K) = K and both unbounded
components of the complement of K are invariant under f , then f has a ﬁxed point
in Fill(K).

Proof. Note ﬁrst that the curves γN and γS (the notation makes reference to the
curve γ constructed in AN , resp. AS) are as close to the set K as wished. Both
curves are positively oriented, and their indexes diﬀer, because

If (γN ) ≥ d > 1 ≥ If (γS).

Now Lefschetz ﬁxed point Theorem (see Section 3) shows that f has a ﬁxed
point in the annulus bounded by γN and γS. As these curves can be constructed
arbitrarily close to the boundary of AS and AN , it comes that f has a ﬁxed point
(cid:3)
in Fill(K).

This is not suﬃcient to conclude that f is complete. It just proves that f has a
ﬁxed point, also the same argument shows that every iterate of f has ﬁxed points,
but this contains no additional information. We need to prove that every lift of f
has ﬁxed points.

Remark 3. Adapting the proof of Corollary 3 a well known Theorem due to
Cartwright and Littlewood follows: If an orientation preserving homeomorphism
f of the plane leaves invariant a continuum K not separating the plane, then f has
a ﬁxed point in K.
Indeed, take a curve like γ in the complement of K and the arguments above show
that the index If (γ) is equal to d + J, where d = 1 (as f is a homeomorphism) and
J ≥ 0.

4.2. Lifting the construction. We will lift the construction in the annulus and
consider an arbitrary lift F of f . We will prove that F has a ﬁxed point (in order
to prove completeness by Proposition 1). Assume by contradiction that F is ﬁxed
point free. It is not straightforward to lift the construction. The diﬃculty comes at
ﬁrst sight, when the preimage of K under the covering projection is not compact.
But there are others, as will become clear while calculating the index of a curve.

The universal covering of the annulus is given by the map Π : C → C \ {0},
written in complex coordinates as Π(z) = exp(2πiz). Note that Π(z + 1) = Π(z)
so the group of deck transformations is generated by the translation z → z + 1.
Let K(cid:48) be the preimage of K under the covering projection. Note that K(cid:48) is not
a compact set but is a closed subset of some horizontal strip −T ≤ y ≤ T ; we will
assume T = 1 to simplify notation. Moreover, K(cid:48) separates the plane in at least two
components, one contains {y ≤ −1}, denoted A(cid:48)
S and the other contains {y ≥ 1},
denoted A(cid:48)

N . Denote as usual z = (x, y) for the compex number z = x + iy.

Let γ and α the curves in AS constructed above and denote by γS and αS the
preimages of γ and α under the covering projection. These are embedded lines,
each one of which separates the plane in two components.

0 to qN
the lines αN and αS is denoted by A0. Let V0 be a simple curve from qS
0 ⊃ V0 an embedded line that

contained in A0, and let Vm = V0 + (m, 0). Let V (cid:48)
0 in the connected component of R2\V (cid:48)
separates the plane leaving γS
0 to the
right of V (cid:48)
0 + (m, 0). Clearly V0 separates the horizontal strip A0.
Note that as F (x + 1, y) = F (x, y) + (d, 0), and d > 1, then there exists m > 0 such
that the following conditions hold:

0 . Let V (cid:48)

m = V (cid:48)

0 ∪ γN

(1) The image of Vm under F is contained in the connected component of

R2 \ V (cid:48)

m.
−m to the left of V (cid:48)

(2) The image of V−m under F is contained in the connected component of
m = ∅ and F (V±m) ∩ ΓN
(3) F (V±m) ∩ ΓS
Finally, let β be the simple closed curve

tion of crosscuts, each one satisﬁyng F (c(cid:48)
i lifts ci. There exists
m = ∅. Let J S be the number of crosscuts
m)∩ΓS
F (cid:48), homotopic to F , such that F (cid:48)(ΓS
i) ⊂ N (c(cid:48)
i). Deﬁne J N analogously. Moreover, note
contained in ΓS
that F (cid:48)(ΓS
S, as well as F (cid:48)(ΓN
m) is contained in the region A(cid:48)
N . By application
of Lemma 2 it follows that the IF (β) = IF (cid:48)(β) + J S + J N .
F (cid:48)(ΓS
IF (cid:48)(β) = 1 as β is contained in intF (β).

Note that F (cid:48)(β) ∩ β = ∅. The fact that F (cid:48)(ΓN
N and that
m) ⊂ A(cid:48)
S and that F (cid:48) = F in Vm ∪ V−m and the choice of m imply that
This implies that the index of IF (β) (cid:54)= 0 and this is absurd since we have assumed

m) is contained in A(cid:48)

m) ⊂ A(cid:48)

that F was ﬁxed point free. It follows that every lift of f has ﬁxed points.

Recall that to ﬁnish the proof of this theorem, it remains to consider the case
where the unbounded components of the complement of K are not invariant, but
two-periodic (Remark 2). That is:

Assume that f (AS) = AN and f (AN ) = AS.

12

Figure 3.

Let k be an even number. Then f k satisﬁes the assumptions made above, (that
AS and AN are f k-invariant), therefore any lift G of f k has a ﬁxed point. On the
other hand, let k be an odd number and G a lift of f k. Note ﬁrst that there exists a
positive number R such that G({y = R}) is contained in {y ≤ 0} and G({y = −R})
is contained in {y ≥ 0}. By assumption, d > 1, which implies that there exists a
number m such that G(m, y) ∩ {x < m} = ∅ and G(−m, y) ∩ {x > −m} = ∅
whenever −R ≤ y ≤ R. Let Γ be the simple closed curve whose trace is the
boundary of the rectangle with vertices x = ±m, y = ±R; give Γ the positive
orientation. Then Γ satisﬁes the hypothesis of Lemma 3. Thus the index of G in
Γ is equal to −1.
It follows that G has ﬁxed points. This ﬁnishes the proof of
Theorem 1.

Remark 4.

(1) It was assumed that f is surjective. It can be seen from the
proofs above that it is suﬃcient to assume that the invariant continuum K
is contained in the interior of f (A).

(2) Assume that f (AS) = AN and f (AN ) = AS, then the following assertion

is also true:
Let f be a map of the annulus that interchange the ends (meaning that f
can be continuously extended to A ∪ {S, N} in such a way that {S, N} is
two-periodic). If the degree of f has absolute value greater than 1, then for
every odd k, the map f k has at least |dk− 1| ﬁxed points. For d > 1 use the
arguments above and for d < −1, the conclusion follows from Remark 1. In
n ln(#{Fix(f n)}) ≥ ln(d)
particular, the growth rate inequality lim supn→∞ 1
holds for f .

5. Locally connected boundary.

Let K ⊂ A be an essential locally connected continuum. We will use the following

properties:

43, p.193 in [Mo].

(1) There exists a simple essential closed curve contained in K. See Theorem
(2) K(cid:48) = Π−1(K) is connected and locally connected.
(3) Let U be an unbounded connected component of A\K. For all  > 0 there
exists a neighborhood W of K in U such that the radial retraction r of W
onto K satisﬁes d(x, r(x)) <  for all x ∈ W (here ’radial’ stands for the
induced retraction on W by the Riemann map). This is true because K is

13

locally connected and therefore the Riemann map extends continuously to
D.

S = Π−1(AS).

m, contains K(cid:48).

Theorem 2. Let f : A → A, K ⊂ A an essential continuum such that f (K) ⊂ K.
If K is locally connected and |d| > 1, then f is complete on Fill(K).
Notations: Π : A(cid:48) → A is the universal covering of the annulus A, the component
of the complement of K that contains N is called AN and that containing S is
denoted AS. Moreover, A(cid:48) is identiﬁed with the product R × (−1, 1), and deﬁne
A(cid:48)
N = Π−1(AN ) and A(cid:48)
Proof. Note that for all  > 0 there exists a simple closed curve α ⊂ AN such that
d(z, K) <  for every z ∈ α ∪ f (α). Analogously, there exists a simple closed curve
β ⊂ AS satisfying the same properties. Let α(cid:48) and β(cid:48) be the preimages of α and β
by the covering projection. Note that both α(cid:48) and β(cid:48) separate A(cid:48) and as they do
not intersect, then there is also a component of A(cid:48) \ (α(cid:48) ∪ β(cid:48)) whose boundary is
α(cid:48) ∪ β(cid:48), and this component, denoted A(cid:48)
Let F be any lift of f . Suppose that Fix(F )∩FillK(cid:48) = ∅ (otherwise we are done).
So, there exists  > 0 such that d(x, F (x)) >  for all x ∈ FillK(cid:48). For this , choose
α and β as above. By Property (3) of locally connected sets at the beginning of
this section, there exists a deformation retract r : W → K(cid:48) such that d(r, id) < /2,
where W is a neighborhood of K(cid:48). So, r ◦ F (α(cid:48)) is contained in K(cid:48). Analogously,
r◦F (β(cid:48)) is contained in K(cid:48). Besides, the set of ﬁxed points of r◦F in FillK(cid:48) are the
same as those of F . If d > 1, we may choose real numbers x0 < x1 such that the
m is mapped under r ◦ F strictly
intersection of the vertical segment (x1, y) with A(cid:48)
to its right, and the intersection of the vertical segment (x0, y) with A(cid:48)
m is mapped
under r ◦ F strictly to its left.
Let γ be the simple closed curve constructed with the segments of α(cid:48) and β(cid:48)
between x0 and x1 and the subarcs of the vertical segments (x0, y) and (x1, y) that
are contained in A(cid:48)
m.
Note that if γ is positively oriented then Corollary 3 (of Lemma 3) gives Ir◦F =
−1. This was assuming d > 1. If d < −1, then the vertical segments at x0 and x1
can be taken so that the vertical at x0 is mapped to the right of x1 and the vertical
at x1 is mapped to the left of x0. Now apply Corollary 4 to obtain that the index
is equal to 1. So, Fix(F ) ∩ Fill(K(cid:48)) (cid:54)= ∅.
(cid:3)
Example. We will show that if d ≤ −1 it may happen that f is ﬁxed point free
on K. Let K be as in Figure 1 (a). We will construct a map F : A(cid:48) → A(cid:48) such
that F (x + 1) = F (x) − 1. Take a fundamental domain D of K(cid:48) as in Figure 1
(b) and we proceed to deﬁne F on D. Let j : [0, 1] → D a parametrization such
that: j(x) (cid:54)= j(y) for all {x, y} (cid:54)= {a, b}, x (cid:54)= y, and such that j(a) = j(b). First
deﬁne F0 : [0, 1] → [0, 1] (discontinuous) as in Figure 4 (c). Note that there exists
F : D → D such that jF0(t) = F j(t). Moreover F is continuous on D, as the
disconitnuity of F0 can be avoided on j([0, 1]) because j(a) = j(b). Clearly, F0 is
ﬁxed point free. If F has a ﬁxed point x = j(t), then

x = F (x) = F j(t) = jF0(t).

So, jF0(t) = j(t) implying t = F0(t) because t and F0(t) are diﬀerent from a and b.
Note that F factors to a map f : A → A of degree −1 and that it is ﬁxed point
free by construction. We have then proved that with d = −1 one can avoid having

14

J.IGLESIAS, A.PORTELA, A.ROVELLA AND J.XAVIER

a ﬁxed point on K. Note that with exactly the same technique one can build a
map f , not complete in K, of any given degree d < −1.

Figure 4.

To assure the existence of periodic points in K, and not just Fill(K), we assume
in the next Theorem that K is the boundary of one of the unbounded components
of its complement and that d > 1.
Theorem 4. Let f : A → A be a map of degree d, K ⊂ A a locally connected
essential continuum such that f (K) ⊂ K. Assume that K is the boundary of one
of the unbounded connected components of its complement.
If d > 1, then f is
complete on K.
Proof. By hypothesis K(cid:48)
Π−1(R).
The preimage under Π of the curve given by property (1) at the beginning of this
section, gives a continuous 1-periodic function i : R → K(cid:48) with the following prop-
erties:

is the boundary of a simply connected region R(cid:48) =

(1) i is a homeomorphism from R onto i(R).
(2) i(R) separates the plane.

Claim. Let C be a connected component of K(cid:48) \ i(R). Then C, the closure of C,
intersects i(R) in a one point set.
To prove this claim note ﬁrst that the intersection is not empty because K(cid:48) is
connected as K is locally connected. Now assume that there are points x < y such
that i(x) and i(y) belong to C. As i(R) is contained in K(cid:48) and K(cid:48) is the boundary
of an unbounded region R(cid:48), for all z ∈ (x, y) there exists a simple embedded line
r ⊂ R(cid:48) landing at i(z) and separating R(cid:48) in two connected components A and B.
As C must have points in A and in B, this contradicts the fact that C is connected.
From now on the unique point of i(R) ∩ C is denoted by p(C).
Deﬁne a map ψ : K(cid:48) → i(R) that is the identity on i(R) and to each point x
in a component C of K(cid:48) \ i(R) assigns the point p(C). We claim that as K(cid:48) is
locally connected, ψ is continuous. To see this, note that if z ∈ i(R), then for all
neighborhood V of z there exists a neighborhood U of z such that if p(C) ∈ U
and p(C) (cid:54)= z then C ⊂ V . Otherwise, there exist a sequence Cn of diﬀerent
components accumulating both on z and in a point z(cid:48) in ∂V \i(R). This contradicts
local connectivity. Continuity of ψ now follows.
Deﬁne F (cid:48) = i−1ψF i. This is a continuous function from R to R. The assumption
d > 1 implies that there is a point x0 such that F (cid:48)(x) < x for every x < x0 and a

15

point x1 such that F (cid:48)(x) > x for every x > x1. Let y0 be the supremum of the set of
points y such that F (cid:48)(y) < y. As F (cid:48) is continuous, F (cid:48)(y0) = y0 and by deﬁnition of
y0, F (cid:48)(z) ≥ z for every z > y0. Then either i(y0) is ﬁxed for F or F (i(y0)) belongs
to a component C of K(cid:48) \ i(R) such that p(C) = i(y0). In the latter case, let V ⊂ C
be a neighborhood of F i(y0) in K(cid:48) such that V ∩ i(R) = ∅. Now let z > y0 be close
to y0 in such a way that F i(z) ∈ V . So F (i(z)) ∈ C and it follows that F (cid:48)(z) = y0.
(cid:3)
This is a contradiction, so the unique conclusion left is F (y0) = y0.
Theorem 3. Let f : A → A be a degree d map of the annulus, where |d| > 1. Each
one of the following conditions imply that f is complete.

(1) Both ends of A are attracting.
(2) Both ends of A are repelling.

Proof. The hypothesis of the ﬁrst assertion implies that deﬁning f (N ) = N and
f (S) = S gives a continuous extension of f to A∗, the compactiﬁcation of the
annulus with two points, in such a way that N and S become topological attractors.
Then there exists a simple closed essential curve α whose image under f is contained
in αN , the connected component of A∗ that contains N . Similarly, there is a simple
closed essential curve β whose image under f is contained in βS. Now let F be a lift
of f , α(cid:48) and β(cid:48) the preimages of α and β under the covering projection, so that there
is a region L ⊂ A(cid:48) whose boundary is the union of α(cid:48) and β(cid:48). Let V0 be a simple
arc having one point in α(cid:48) another point in β(cid:48) and whose interior is contained in L,
and let Vm = V0 + (0, m) for m ∈ Z. Let Γm be the simple closed curve formed with
Vm, V−m and parts of α(cid:48) and β(cid:48). The fact that |d| > 1 implies that there exists
m > 0 such that F (Γm) does not intersect Γm and that IF (Γm) = ±1, depending
on d > 0 or d < 0. It follows that F has a ﬁxed point. As every iterate of f satisﬁes
the same hypothesis, then f is complete.

For the case of repelling ends, there exists a curve α, close to the end N of the
annulus, such that f (α) is contained in the component of the complement of α that
does not contain N . There will be as well a curve β, close to S, whose image under
f is contained in the component of the complement of β that contains N . Next
consider a lift F of f , take the preimages of α and β in the universal covering and
cut it with vertical arcs, in such a way to obtain a curve γ whose sides are α(cid:48), β(cid:48)
and vertical segments, and satisﬁes the properties of the curve γ of Corollary 3 if
d > 1. The Corollary implies that the index of F in γ is equal to −1. On the other
hand, if d < −1, then the comments succeding Corollary 3 imply that IF (γ) = 1.
This implies that every lift of f has a ﬁxed point. As every f k satisﬁes the same
hypothesis, it follows that f is complete.

(cid:3)

6. Applications

The ﬁrst result is a consequence of Hagopian’s theorem [H] which states that
an arcwise connected plane continuum K that does not separate the plane has the
ﬁxed point property (i.e. every continuous map from K to K has a ﬁxed point in
K). We will use this theorem on the universal covering, so we need that the lift of
K is arcwise connected. This may not happen even if the set K is arcwise connected
(see Figure 6). However, note that in this example the set K is simply connected.
If one assumes that K has a nontrivial closed loop, this guarantees that the lift is

16

J.IGLESIAS, A.PORTELA, A.ROVELLA AND J.XAVIER

arcwise connected.

(a)

(b)

Figure 5.

Proposition 2. Let f : A → A, K ⊂ A a continuum such that f (K) ⊂ K. Assume
that K is arcwise-connected, and i∗ : π1(K) → π1(A) is surjective.
If d < −1 and k is odd, then every lift F of f k has a ﬁxed point. It follows that
If d = −1, then f has a ﬁxed point in Fill(K).
Compare with Theorem 1 where it was proved that f−1(K) = K and d > 1

f satisﬁes the growth rate inequality.

implies completeness.
Proof. By hypothesis, K(cid:48) and Fill(K(cid:48)) are arcwise connected. Take F any lift of
f k. As k is odd, then f k has negative degree. One can modify F outside Fill(K(cid:48)) so
that it can be extended to R×[0, 1]. Let D be the compactiﬁcation of R×[0, 1] with
two points −∞, +∞, which is a topological closed disk. As d < 0, F interchanges
these two points and Fill(K(cid:48)) ⊂ D is compact. By Hagopian’s Theorem [H], F
must have a ﬁxed point in Fill(K(cid:48)), and this point does not belong to {−∞, +∞}.
It follows that F has a ﬁxed point in Fill(K(cid:48)). Concluding, if d < −1 then every lift
of f k with odd k has a ﬁxed point. This implies that f k has at least |dk − 1| ﬁxed
points, so f satisﬁes the growth rate inequality. For d = −1, just the existence of
(cid:3)
a ﬁxed point in Fill(K) can be assured.
As an application, we obtain a forcing result for f : S2 → S2: a completely

invariant orbit of period two implies that the growth inequality holds for f .
Proposition 3. Let f : S2 → S2 be a map of degree d, |d| > 1. Suppose that there
exists p, q ∈ S2 such that f−1(p) = {q} and f−1(q) = {p}. Then, f k has at least
|dk − 1| ﬁxed points for every odd k.
Proof. The restriction of f to S2 \{p, q} is a degree d map of the annulus satisfying
the hypothesis of the second assertion in Remark 4 after the proof of Theorem
(cid:3)
1.

Another result for the sphere:

Proposition 4. Let f : S2 → S2 be a map of degree d > 1. Assume that there exists
two disjoint simply connected nonempty open sets U1 and U2 such that f−1(Ui) = Ui
for i = 1, 2. Then, f has at least the same number of periodic points as zd on S1.

kkkEXISTENCE OF PERIODIC POINTS FOR SELF MAPS OF THE ANNULUS.

17

Proof. Let K be the complement of U1∪U2 in S2. Then K is a completely invariant
continuum. For i = 1, 2 choose points pi ∈ Ui. Let f(cid:48) be a map homotopic to f such
that f = f(cid:48) in a neighborhood of K and such that (f(cid:48))−1(pi) = {pi} for i = 1, 2.
Then f(cid:48) is a degree d map of the annulus S2 \ {p1, p2} and has a completely
invariant essential continuum K. By Theorem 1 f(cid:48) is complete on K = Fill(K),
so it has at least the same number of periodic points as zd on S1. The conclusion
(cid:3)
follows because f = f(cid:48) on K.
