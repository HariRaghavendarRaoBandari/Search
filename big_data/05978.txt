Abstract

We argue that extensions of the Standard Model (SM) with a warped extra di-
mension, which successfully address the hierarchy and ﬂavor problems of elementary
particle physics, can provide an elegant explanation of the 750 GeV diphoton excess
recently reported by ATLAS and CMS. A gauge-singlet bulk scalar with O(1) couplings
to fermions is identiﬁed as the new resonance S, and the vector-like Kaluza-Klein ex-
citations of the SM quarks and leptons mediate its loop-induced couplings to photons
and gluons. The electroweak gauge symmetry almost unambiguously dictates the bulk
matter content and hence the hierarchies of the S → γγ, W W , ZZ, Zγ, t¯t and dijet
decay rates. We ﬁnd that the S → Zγ decay mode is strongly suppressed, such that
Br(S → Zγ)/Br(S → γγ) < 0.1. The hierarchy problem for the new scalar boson is
solved in analogy with the Higgs boson by localizing it near the infrared brane. The inﬁ-
nite sums over the Kaluza-Klein towers of fermion states are ﬁnite and can be calculated
in closed form with a remarkably simple result. Reproducing the observed pp → S → γγ
signal requires Kaluza-Klein masses in the multi-TeV range, consistent with bounds from
ﬂavor physics and electroweak precision observables.

Useful side products of our analysis, which can be adapted to almost any model for
the diphoton resonance, are the calculation of the gluon-fusion production cross section
σ(pp → S) at NNLO in QCD, an exact expression for the inclusive S → gg decay rate
at N3LO, a study of the S → t¯th three-body decay and a phenomenological analysis of
portal couplings connecting S with the Higgs ﬁeld.

1 Introduction

The 750 GeV excess in the diphoton invariant mass spectrum seen in the ﬁrst 13 TeV data de-
livered by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [1] could have far-reaching implications for physics
beyond the Standard Model (SM). A combination of the ATLAS and CMS measurements at
√s = 8 TeV and 13 TeV yields [2]

σ(pp → S → γγ) = (4.6 ± 1.2) fb .

(1)

If this intriguing signal is conﬁrmed to be due to new physics, minimal extensions of the SM
with a single new scalar S as well as many theoretically motivated ultraviolet (UV) com-
pletions are ruled out as possible explanations (see e.g. [3]). The reason is that additional
new particles with large a multiplicity or sizable couplings to S have to enter the S → γγ
loop for both gluon-fusion or b¯b-initiated production processes [4]. Producing the resonance
from other quark-initiated states results in a tension with 8 TeV data, while photon-induced
production would require non-perturbatively large couplings [5, 6]. Supersymmetric UV com-
pletions of the SM, which motivate such additional degrees of freedom, lack a neutral scalar
candidate with appropriate couplings, and the full parameter space of the Minimal Super-
symmetric SM is excluded as a consequence [7]. One thus has to resort to models with a
low supersymmetry-breaking scale, which allow for a sgoldstino explanation [8], or R-parity
violating scenarios, in which the sneutrino can have large enough couplings to account for
the excess [9, 10]. Composite Higgs models predict several composite resonances that can
facilitate a large diphoton branching ratio [11–14]. Neutral composite scalars, which appear in
non-minimal composite Higgs models with larger coset structure, as well as the dilaton/radion
have been considered as possible candidates for S. While theoretically motivated, the latter
implies a small radius of the extra dimension in order to enhance the couplings to diphotons
[15], unless the Higgs-radion mixing is tuned to a particular value [16, 17]. In this regard, the
sgoldstino and radion explanations have similar eﬀects on the scale of the UV completion of
supersymmetric and composite Higgs theories, respectively. It is a tantalizing fact that many
theoretically well-motivated, minimal extensions of the SM cannot explain the excess without
such unpredicted consequences. On the other hand, several non-minimal extensions of the SM
have been proposed, which can explain the diphoton excess along with other anomalies in the
ﬂavor sector and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon [7, 18–24].

In this paper we argue that Randall-Sundrum (RS) models featuring a warped extra di-
mension [25], with all SM ﬁelds (with the possible exception of the Higgs boson) propagating
in the bulk, can explain the observed excess in a natural way. We introduce a bulk scalar
singlet, whose only renormalizable interactions – with the exception of a possible Higgs portal
– are couplings to bilinears of vector-like bulk fermions. Remarkably, for O(1) couplings of this
new scalar the diphoton excess is explained for Kaluza-Klein (KK) masses in the multi-TeV
range without any additional model building. This mass scale is suﬃciently large to avoid
constraints from electroweak precision tests, ﬂavor physics and Higgs phenomenology. Our
results are largely insensitive to the parameters of the RS model, such as the ﬁve-dimensional
(5D) masses of the fermions and their Yukawa couplings to the Higgs ﬁeld. To good ap-
proximation the loop-induced couplings of the new resonance S to diboson states just count
the number of degrees of freedom propagating in the loop (times group-theory factors). We

1

consider three implementations of the RS model with diﬀerent fermion contents and present
detailed predictions for the gluon-fusion production cross section σ(pp → S) and the rates for
the decays S → γγ, W W , ZZ, Zγ, gg, t¯t and t¯th, all of which are found within current ex-
perimental bounds. We note in passing that our scenario is particularly well motivated if one
assumes the new scalar to take on a vacuum expectation value, which generates the fermion
bulk mass terms, thus providing a mechanism for the ﬂavor-speciﬁc localization of fermions
along the extra dimension [26, 27]. In this case, the bulk scalar would assume the role of the
localizer ﬁeld ﬁrst introduced in the context of split fermion models [28]. We shall explore this
intriguing possibility in future work.

We are aware of only a few papers in which the possibility of an extra-dimensional origin
of the diphoton signal has been explored. The authors of [29] considered a model with a
ﬂat extra dimension. While such a framework does not address the hierarchy problem of
the Higgs boson and the new scalar resonance, this work shares several technical similarities
with our approach. However, the warped background of RS models makes our calculations
more demanding. In [30] it was assumed that the new resonance couples to the SM only via
loops involving heavy vector-like leptons. In order to obtain the very large couplings required
in this case [5, 6], the construction relies on more than one ﬂat extra dimension, and only
SM lepton ﬁelds are placed in the bulk. This treatment gives up the attractive possibility
of understanding the ﬂavor hierarchies from an extra-dimensional perspective. The authors
found that the overlap integrals in their calculation required a cutoﬀ, which was introduced by
hand and motivated based on stringy arguments. In [31–33] the new resonance was identiﬁed
with the lowest spin-2 KK graviton in warped extra-dimension models.

This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we brieﬂy introduce the basic construction
of warped extra-dimensional models and derive expressions for the mass and the wave-function
of the bulk scalar S. In Section 3 we compute the eﬀective Wilson coeﬃcients parameterizing
the couplings of S to SM gauge bosons and top quarks by integrating out the heavy fermionic
KK modes, considering both the minimal RS model as well as two diﬀerent extensions with
a custodial symmetry. Section 4 deals with the phenomenology of the resonance S. In the
context of an eﬀective Lagrangian with local interactions of S with SM ﬁelds, we ﬁrst calculate
the gluon-fusion production cross section σ(pp → S) at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO)
in QCD perturbation theory, the inclusive S → gg decay rate at N3LO, and the S → γγ, W W ,
ZZ, Zγ, t¯t decay rates at leading order. We then perform ﬁts to the diphoton signal in the
parameter space of the RS models, taking into account existing constraints from LHC Run 1
resonance searches. In Section 5 we study the impact of possible Higgs portal interactions
of S on the various branching fractions, including the S → hh signal. The three-body decay
mode S → t¯th is studied in Section 6, before we conclude in Section 7. Some technical details
are relegated to two appendices.

2 RS Model with a Bulk Scalar Field

We consider extensions of the SM with a warped extra dimension, described by an S1/Z2
orbifold parameterized by a coordinate φ ∈ [−π, π], with two branes localized on the orbifold
ﬁxed-points: the UV brane at φ = 0, and the infrared (IR) brane at |φ| = π. The curvature

k and radius r of the extra dimension are assumed to be of Planck size, k ∼ 1/r ∼ MPl, and
the metric reads [25]

where σ(φ) = kr|φ| is referred to as the warp factor. The quantity L = σ(π) = krπ ∼ 34
measures the size of the extra dimension and is chosen so as to explain the hierarchy between
the Planck scale and the TeV scale [34]. With the help of the curvature and the warp factor

evaluated on the IR brane,  = e−L ∼ 10−15, one deﬁnes the KK scale MKK ≡ k. It sets

the mass scale for the low-lying KK excitations of the model and controls the mass splitting
between the KK modes. On the right-hand side of (2) we have introduced the dimensionless
coordinate t deﬁned by t =  eσ(φ) ∈ [, 1], which will be used throughout this work.
It is
related to the frequently used conformal coordinate z by the rescaling z = t/MKK.

The hierarchy problem is solved by localizing the SM Higgs ﬁeld on or near the IR brane,
eﬀectively cutting oﬀ UV-divergent contributions to the Higgs mass at the scale ΛIR = MPl ∼
TeV [25]. If gauge bosons and fermions are promoted to 5D bulk ﬁelds, the ﬂavor problem can
be addressed in a natural way by means of diﬀerent localizations of the fermion zero modes
along the extra dimension [26, 27]. The large hierarchies in the spectrum of fermion masses and
mixing angles can then be reproduced by small variations of parameters in the underlying 5D
Lagrangian [35]. The minimal RS model with bulk ﬁelds, which has the same gauge symmetry
and matter content as the SM, is strongly constrained by electroweak precision observables
[36, 37]. A recent tree-level analysis of the S and T parameters yields the lower bound [38]

MKK > 4.9 TeV @ 95% CL

(minimal RS model) .

(3)

Since the masses of the low-lying KK excitations are typically several times heavier than MKK
(for example, the lightest KK gluon and photon have a mass of 2.45 MKK [39]), this puts them
out of the reach for discovery at the LHC. Bounds from electroweak precision observables
are considerably relaxed if the electroweak sector respects the custodial symmetry present in
the SM. This implies an enhanced bulk gauge group SU (3)c × SU (2)L × SU (2)R × U (1)X ×
PLR, whose SU (2) subgroups are broken on the IR brane via a Higgs bi-doublet according
to SU (2)L × SU (2)R → SU (2)V . The custodial SU (2)V symmetry in the IR protects the
T parameter [40, 41]. Boundary conditions on the UV brane break SU (2)R × U (1)X →
U (1)Y . The PLR symmetry prevents the left-handed Zb¯b coupling [42] and its ﬂavor-changing
counterparts [43] from receiving too large corrections. As a result, the bound on the KK scale
is lowered to [38]

MKK > 1.9 TeV @ 95% CL

(custodial RS model) .

(4)

Thorough discussions of this model containing many technical details can be found in [44, 45].
In the following, we will consider two diﬀerent versions of the custodial RS model: one with
a symmetric implementation of the quark and lepton sectors (custodial model I), and one in
which the lepton sector is more minimal than the quark sector (custodial model II) [46].

Besides electroweak precision tests, RS models are constrained by ﬂavor observables [43,
44, 47–49] and Higgs phenomenology [45, 46, 50–52]. The most severe ﬂavor constraint comes

3

from K− ¯K mixing [48]. In the minimal model the KK scale is so high that this bound can be
satisﬁed with a modest 25% ﬁne-tuning. For the lower values of the KK mass scale allowed
in the custodial model, the ﬂavor constraints can either be solved by means of a 5− 10 %
ﬁne-tuning or by enlarging the strong-interaction gauge group in the bulk [53]. Additional
constraints arising from the phenomenology of the Higgs boson, such as its production cross
section and decay rates into γγ, ZZ and W W , are more model dependent and can readily be
made consistent with present data by adjusting some model parameters.

We identify the diphoton resonance with the lightest excitation of a new bulk scalar ﬁeld
S(x, φ), which is a singlet of the full bulk gauge group. In order to allow for a coupling of this
ﬁeld to the scalar density of the vector-like 5D fermion ﬁelds we need to implement S(x, φ) as
an odd ﬁeld on the S1/Z2 orbifold, such that S(x,−φ) = −S(x, φ). The relevant terms in the
action read

where the sum extends over all 5D fermion multiplets f . Even in the minimal RS model
there exists a 4-component vector-like 5D fermion ﬁeld for every Weyl fermion of the SM.
The SM fermions correspond to the zero modes of these ﬁelds, which become massive after
electroweak symmetry breaking. Consequently, for each SM fermion there exist two towers
of KK excitations [54]. In extensions of the RS model with a custodial symmetry additional
exotic matter ﬁelds are introduced, which have no zero modes but give rise to additional towers
of KK excitations, thereby increasing the number of vector-like fermions of the model [40, 41].
The bulk masses Mf and couplings Gf are hermitian matrices in generation space. By means
of ﬁeld redeﬁnitions one can arrange that Mf are real, diagonal matrices. From now on we
will always work in this so-called bulk mass basis. The values of the bulk masses determine
the proﬁles of the SM fermions along the extra dimension, which generically turn out to be
localized near one of the two branes [26, 27]. Note that there is the intriguing possibility that
the bulk masses could be generated dynamically in models where the scalar ﬁeld S acquires a
vacuum expectation value w, such that Mf = wGf . While we leave the detailed construction
of such models to future work, we shall assume that the structure of the couplings Gf follows
the structure of Mf .

In (5) we have not considered the possibility of a portal coupling ∼ S |Φ|2 connecting the
ﬁeld S with the Higgs doublet. We will investigate the phenomenological impact of such a
coupling on the various decay rates of the resonance S in Section 4, ﬁnding rather strong
constraints. An extra-dimensional setup, in which the Higgs sector is localized on the IR
brane, where the Z2-odd scalar ﬁeld S vanishes, might provide a dynamical explanation for
the suppression of the portal interaction.

The solution of the ﬁeld equations satisﬁed by the KK modes of the scalar ﬁeld S is obtained
in complete analogy to the case of a bulk scalar ﬁeld studied in [38, 55, 56]. Imposing the KK

3 Diboson Signals from Warped Space

In the models we consider, the masses of the KK excitations of gauge bosons and fermions are
bound by constraints from electroweak precision and ﬂavor observables to lie in the multi-TeV
range. The 750 GeV resonance is considerably lighter, and it is thus justiﬁed to integrate out
the tower of fermion KK modes in computing the decays of S to diboson or fermionic ﬁnal
states. Below the KK mass scale we deﬁne the eﬀective Lagrangian

µν and Bµν are the ﬁeld strength tensors of SU (3)c, SU (2)L and U (1)Y ,
respectively, Φ is the scalar Higgs doublet, and sw = sin θw and cw = cos θw are functions of the
weak mixing angle. Since the mass of the new resonance is much larger than the electroweak
scale, it is appropriate to write the eﬀective Lagrangian in the electroweak symmetric phase.
Upon electroweak symmetry breaking the second and third operator in the ﬁrst line generate
the couplings of S to pairs of electroweak gauge bosons. In particular, the resulting diphoton
coupling is

S FµνF µν , with cγγ = cW W + cBB .

The terms in the second line in (14) describe the couplings of S to fermion pairs (with or
without a Higgs boson). In our model these couplings have a hierarchical structure, and the
dominant eﬀect by far is the coupling to the top quark. Rewriting Re[(Cu)33] = ctt yt, where
yt = √2mt/v is the top-quark Yukawa coupling, we can express the corresponding term as

S ¯tt + . . . .

(16)

The Wilson coeﬃcients in the eﬀective Lagrangian are suppressed by the mass scale of the
heavy KK particles, cii ∝ 1/MKK. In the remainder of this section we will calculate these
coeﬃcients at the matching scale ΛKK = few × MKK corresponding to the masses of the
low-lying KK modes, which give the dominant contributions.
It is well known that the two-gluon operator has a non-trivial QCD evolution [58, 59] and
mixes with the operator in (16) under renormalization [60]. These eﬀects are discussed in
detail in Appendix A. When the strong coupling αs and the Yukawa coupling yt are factored
out from the deﬁnitions of cgg and ctt as we have done above, evolution eﬀects from the high
matching scale ΛKK to the scale µ = mS only arise at NLO in renormalization-group (RG)
improved perturbation theory. At this order they give rise to the simple relations

where β0 = 7, β1 = 26 and CF = 4/3. The coeﬃcients cW W and cBB remain invariant
under QCD evolution. Even if the coupling of S to top quarks would be absent at the high
matching scale, it is inevitably induced through RG evolution; however, this is a very small
eﬀect. For ΛKK = 5 TeV and µ = 750 GeV we ﬁnd ctt(µ) ≈ ctt(ΛKK) − 0.0028 cgg(ΛKK) and
cgg(µ) ≈ 1.0045 cgg(ΛKK). Higher-order QCD corrections to the Wilson coeﬃcients at the high
matching scale are likely to have a more important impact. For instance, they enhance the
top-quark contribution to the Higgs-boson production cross section in the SM by about 20%
[61, 62]. To be conservative we will not include such enhancement factors in our analysis.

3.1 Diboson couplings induced by KK fermion exchange

Since the scalar ﬁeld S is a gauge singlet, its couplings to gauge bosons are induced by fermion
loop diagrams, such as those shown in Figure 1. The relevant couplings in (5) are parameter-
ized by the matrices Gf , while the proﬁles of the fermions along the extra dimension depend
on the (diagonal) bulk mass matrices Mf .
It is conventional to deﬁne dimensionless bulk
mass parameters by cf = ±Mf /k, where the plus (minus) sign holds for fermion ﬁelds whose
left-handed (right-handed) components have even proﬁle functions under the Z2 symmetry. In
the minimal RS model the SU (2)L fermion doublets have even left-handed components, while
the SU (2)L fermion singlets have even right-handed components.
In extensions of the RS
model ﬁelds transforming as SU (2)L triplets also have even right-handed components. Using
the same sign conventions, we deﬁne dimensionless couplings gf of S to fermions via

(cid:112)k(1 + β)

gf = ±

2 + β

Gf .

(18)

This deﬁnition is analogous to the deﬁnition of the dimensionless Yukawa couplings in RS
models with a bulk Higgs ﬁeld studied in [38, 51, 63]. The β-dependent terms ensure that
the dimensionless couplings remain well-behaved in the limit β → ∞ of an IR brane-localized
scalar ﬁeld. These matrices are hermitian but, in general, not diagonal in generation space.
Since with the exception of the top quark all SM fermions have masses much below the
electroweak scale, the values of most of the bulk mass parameters cf cluster near or below
the critical value −1/2, below which the zero-mode fermion proﬁle is localized near the UV
brane. For example, a typical set of bulk mass parameters adopted in [54] ranges from −0.74
for cu1 to −0.47 for cQ3. The only exception is the parameter ct ≡ cu3 ≈ +0.34 of the right-
handed top quark, which is positive so as to realize a localization near the IR brane. In our
phenomenological analysis below we will for simplicity assume that the diagonal elements of the
matrices gf all have the same sign and magnitude, with the possible exception of gt ≡ (gu)33.
In close analogy with the case of the induced hgg and hγγ couplings of the Higgs boson
in models where all SM ﬁeld propagate in the bulk, we ﬁnd that the sums over the inﬁnite
towers of KK fermion states in Figure 1 converge and can be calculated in closed form using 5D
fermion propagators in the mixed momentum/position representation [64–66]. In the unbroken
phase of the electroweak gauge symmetry (i.e. for v = 0), there is no mixing between fermion
states belonging to diﬀerent multiplets of the gauge group and the fermion propagators are
diagonal matrices in generation space. The Wilson coeﬃcients are then given by sums over
the contributions from the diﬀerent fermion multiplets. Mixing eﬀects induced by electroweak

symmetry breaking yield corrections of order (mf /mS)2 relative to the leading terms we will
compute. Even for the top quark these corrections are at most a few percent and can safely
be neglected.

L = −T 3

The fermion representations of the custodial RS models have been discussed in detail in
[42, 44–46]. We begin with a brief description of the quark sector. As a consequence of the
discrete PLR symmetry, the left-handed bottom quark needs to be embedded in an SU (2)L ×
SU (2)R bi-doublet with isospin quantum numbers T 3
R = −1/2. This assignment
ﬁxes the quantum numbers of the remaining quark ﬁelds uniquely. In particular, the right-
handed down-type quarks have to be embedded in an SU (2)R triplet in order to obtain a
U (1)X-invariant Yukawa coupling. We choose the same SU (2)L × SU (2)R quantum numbers
for all three quark generations, which is necessary to consistently incorporate quark mixing
in the anarchic approach to ﬂavor in warped extra dimensions. Altogether, there are ﬁfteen
diﬀerent quark states in the up sector and nine in the down sector (for three generations). The
boundary conditions give rise to three light modes in each sector, which are identiﬁed with
the SM quarks. These are accompanied by KK towers consisting of groups of ﬁfteen and nine
modes of similar masses in the up and down sectors, respectively. In addition, there is a KK
tower of exotic fermion states with electric charge Qλ = 5/3, which exhibits nine excitations
in each KK level. In order to compute the Wilson coeﬃcients cgg, cW W and cBB in (14) it is
most convenient to decompose these multiplets into multiplets under SU (2)L × U (1)Y . There
are two SU (2)L doublets and one triplet

We only show the chiral components with even Z2 parity; the other chiral components are
odd under the Z2 symmetry. The subscript denotes the hypercharge of each multiplet. The
superscripts on the ﬁelds specify the type of boundary conditions they obey on the UV brane.

zero mode, meaning that we impose a Dirichlet boundary condition on the proﬁle functions of
the corresponding Z2-odd ﬁelds. These zero modes correspond to the SM quarks. Fields with
superscripts (−) correspond to heavy, exotic fermions with no counterparts in the SM. For
these states, the Dirichlet boundary condition is imposed on the Z2-even ﬁelds so as to avoid
the presence of a zero mode. The UV boundary conditions for the ﬁelds of opposite Z2 parity
are of mixed type and follow from the ﬁeld equations. Above we have indicated the bulk mass
parameters associated with the various multiplets.1 The three parameters contained in the
matrix cτ1 can be related to the other ones by extending the PLR symmetry to the part of the
quark sector that mixes with the left-handed down-type zero modes [45]. It then follows that
cτ1 = cd. Whether or not this equation holds turns out to be irrelevant to our discussion.

In the custodial model I the lepton sector is constructed in analogy with the quark sector

[44]. It consists of two SU (2)L doublets and one triplet

Again we only show the chiral components with even Z2 parity. There are ﬁfteen diﬀerent
lepton states in the neutrino sector and nine in the charged-lepton sector. The boundary
conditions give rise to three light modes in each sector, which are identiﬁed with the SM
neutrinos and charged leptons. These are accompanied by KK towers consisting of groups of
ﬁfteen and nine modes in the two sectors, respectively. In addition, there is a KK tower of
exotic lepton states with electric charge Qψ = +1, which exhibits nine excitations in each KK
level. The three parameters contained in the matrix cτ3 can be related to the other ones by
requiring an extended PLR symmetry, in which case cτ3 = ce. In the custodial model II the
lepton sector is more minimal [46]. It consists of one SU (2)L doublet and two singlets

The choice of the boundary conditions is such that the zero modes correspond to the light
leptons of the SM, without a right-handed neutrino. Note that the minimal RS model is
obtained by simply omitting all multiplets containing ﬁelds carrying a superscript “(−)” from
the above list.
The calculation of the one-loop diagrams in Figure 1 proceeds in complete analogy with the
corresponding calculation for a bulk Higgs ﬁeld performed in [38]. One evaluates the amplitude

The zero modes are massless in the limit where v = 0 and hence give no contribution to the
result at leading order.

Note that the sum over KK modes in (26) is logarithmically divergent by naive power
counting, since the masses of the KK modes have approximately equal spacing. Nevertheless
an explicit calculation of the inﬁnite sum leads to a ﬁnite and well-behaved answer, hinting at
a non-trivial interplay of the proﬁle functions for the various KK fermions. The calculation of

Analogous expressions hold for the Wilson coeﬃcients cW W and cBB, as is evident from (24).
In Figure 2 we show the exact numerical results for ∆(±)(cf , β) as functions of the bulk mass
parameter cf for various values of β. Even for MKK as low as 2 TeV we ﬁnd that the corrections
of O(m2
KK) are very small and can safely be neglected. Moreover, for all fermions other
than the right-handed top quark it is an excellent approximation to neglect the exponentially
small quantity F 2(cf ), while for the right-handed top quark we can replace F 2(ct) ≈ 1 + 2ct.
Note that in the limit β → ∞, corresponding to a scalar resonance localized on the IR brane,
we obtain the exact result ∆(±)(cf , β) → 0, and hence the Wilson coeﬃcients in this limit are
simply given in terms of sums over the diagonal elements of the matrices gf , meaning that
they essentially count the number of 5D fermionic degrees of freedom. For simplicity, we will
adopt this approximation in displaying the following results. In our numerical work we will

use the correct expressions, which are obtained by replacing gt ≡ (gu)33 → 1+β−2ct

In the last step in each line we have assumed, for simplicity, that all diagonal entries of
the matrices gf are equal to a universal value geﬀ. While there is no particular reason why
this should be true, the near equality of all cf parameters other than ct suggests that such
an approximation might be reasonable. Note that any reference to the parameter β has
disappeared, except for the small correction term multiplying gt.

In our phenomenological discussion of diboson decays in Section 4 the ratio of the Wilson
coeﬃcients cBB and cW W will play an important role. Neglecting the small correction terms,
we ﬁnd cBB/cW W ≈ 2.19 + 0.04 gt/geﬀ in the custodial model I, cBB/cW W ≈ 2.60 + 0.05 gt/geﬀ
in the custodial model II, and cBB/cW W ≈ 1.44 + 0.22 gt/geﬀ in the minimal RS model.

The resonance S has tree-level couplings to the SM fermions, which are induced after elec-
troweak symmetry breaking. These interactions are very similar to the couplings of a bulk
Higgs to fermions studied in [38]. The largest eﬀects arise in the up-quark sector. We will
discuss them for the case of the minimal RS model, but the ﬁnal result is the same in the
custodial models. Using the zero-mode proﬁle functions derived in [54], we ﬁnd that the
corresponding terms in the eﬀective Lagrangian read (neglecting terms of order m2

fermions the latter one arises from the mixing of the zero modes with their KK excitations
induced by electroweak symmetry breaking. As a consequence, the overlap integrals scale
with the masses of the fermions involved. The 3-dimensional vectors ˆa(U )

mixings in ﬂavor space and are normalized to unity. Their entries are strongly hierarchical,

4 Phenomenology of the Diphoton Resonance

In this section we express the production cross section and the rates for the decays of the
resonance S into SM particles in terms of the Wilson coeﬃcients in the eﬀective Lagrangians
(14) and (16). These results are general and can be applied to any model in which the couplings
of S to SM particles are induced by the exchange of some heavy new particles. We will then
apply these general results to the case of the RS models studied in the previous section.

It is well known from the analogous Higgs production cross
section that higher-order QCD corrections have an enormous impact on the cross section. We
have calculated these corrections up to NNLO and including resummation eﬀects using an
adaption of the public code CuTe [69] developed in [70, 71]. Table 1 shows our results for
the ratio σ(pp → S)/c2

distribution functions (PDFs). Taking the MSTW2008 PDFs as a reference, we obtain

where the errors refer to scale variations and the variations of the PDFs. The program CuTe
also predicts the pT distribution of the produced S bosons, and we ﬁnd that this distribution
peaks around 22 GeV. The higher-order corrections enhance the cross section by more than a
factor 2 compared with the Born cross section in (41).

The Wilson coeﬃcients in (14) also contribute to possible decays of the new resonance into
the electroweak diboson ﬁnal states γγ, W W , ZZ and Zγ, and into hadronic ﬁnal states such
as gg and t¯t. The partial decay rates for the former channels are

the gauge couplings and Weinberg angle are evaluated at the scale appropriate for the ﬁnal-

W = 0.2313 for the weak mixing angle. Apart from known quantities, the two Wilson
coeﬃcients cW W and cBB determine these four rates entirely. It follows that any ratio of two
rates is a function of the ratio cBB/cW W , which in turn is characteristic for the model under
investigation. This is illustrated in Figure 3. Note that the S → Zγ decay rate in particular
strongly depends on the value of cBB/cW W .
In the RS models considered in the previous
section this decay mode turns out to be strongly suppressed.

calculate this partial rate as accurately as possible. Using existing calculations of the Higgs-

derive an exact expression for the S → gg decay rate to the same accuracy. This is discussed

4.2 S-boson phenomenology in RS models

We are now ready to explore the phenomenological consequences of our calculations. The
challenge is to reproduce the observed diphoton rate in (1), while at the same time respecting
existing bounds on dijet, diboson and t¯t resonance searches3 from Run 1 of the LHC, which are
collected in Table 2. Assuming that the new resonance S is predominantly produced via gluon
fusion, as is the case in the RS models we study, the corresponding bounds at √s = 13 TeV
are obtained by multiplying these numbers with the boost factor 4.52 corresponding to the
ratio of the production cross sections in (43).

In Figure 4, we present plots in the MKK/geﬀ − gt/geﬀ plane showing the 1σ and 2σ ﬁt
regions to the diphoton excess in light and dark blue. The central ﬁt values are shown by
the dashed black line. Regions excluded by bounds from resonance searches in data collected
during the 8 TeV run of the LHC are shaded gray with a boundary drawn in red (dijet
searches), purple (t¯t searches), blue (W W searches), orange (ZZ searches) and green (Zγ
searches). Throughout we use β = 1 and ct = 0.4 for the parameters entering the contribution
from the SU (2)L-singlet top quark. The lower right plot shows the variation of the central
ﬁt values for diﬀerent values of the localization parameter β, namely β = 1 (black dashed),
β = 10 (dotted green) and β = ∞ (red). It is apparent that there is only a minor dependence
on this parameter. Changing ct does not substantially alter the ﬁt either.
We observe that in the two versions of the RS model with a custodial symmetry the
diphoton signal can be reproduced over a wide range of parameters without any ﬁne tuning
and without violating any of the bounds from other searches. Depending on the choice of
gt/geﬀ one obtains values for MKK/geﬀ in the range between 2 and 8 TeV. If the KK scale
MKK is close to the lower bound (4) allowed by electroweak precision tests, this requires
couplings geﬀ in the range 0.25 to 1, which are well inside the perturbative region. In this
scenario some of the low-lying KK excitations could have masses around 4 TeV, in which case
they might be discovered in Run 2 of the LHC. If the KK mass scale is signiﬁcantly higher
3Note that the reported bound for the S → t¯t channel might in fact be considerably weaker due to
interference eﬀects not considered in the experimental analyses [79]. The potential impact of these eﬀects has
ﬁrst been pointed out in [80] and has recently been reemphasized in [81, 82].

a direct discovery of KK excitations will not be possible at the LHC. Nevertheless, even for
MKK ≈ 5 TeV (implying KK resonance masses near 10 TeV) the diphoton signal can be
explained with a modest coupling geﬀ ∼ 1. In the minimal RS model the parameter space in
which the diphoton signal can be explained is more constrained. We ﬁnd values in the range
MKK/geﬀ ∼ 0.4−1, which for a KK scale as high as the bound (3) enforced by electroweak
precision tests requires large couplings geﬀ ∼ 5−12, close to the perturbativity limit. One also
needs to require that the ratio gt/geﬀ is negative so as to avoid the strong constraint from t¯t
resonance searches (see, however, footnote 3).

We ﬁnd it useful to deﬁne a benchmark point for each model and study the individual
branching fractions for the various S decay modes for these points. Speciﬁcally, we choose the
points indicated by the orange stars in Figure 4, for which (with β = 1 and ct = 0.4)

Minimal model :

MKK/geﬀ = 0.7 TeV,

Custodial model I : MKK/geﬀ = 5.0 TeV,

Custodial model II : MKK/geﬀ = 4.0 TeV,

gt/geﬀ = −1.5 ,
gt/geﬀ = −0.5 ,
gt/geﬀ = 0 .

(46)

In the upper portion of Table 3 we collect the branching ratios into the various ﬁnal states
for these benchmark models. Note that the S → t¯t decay rate is only calculated at lowest
order in QCD and hence aﬄicted with some uncertainty. The S → t¯t branching ratio is rather
sensitive to the choice of gt/geﬀ, while the remaining branching fractions only mildly depend
on this parameter. The three-body decay mode S → t¯th will be discussed in Section 6. In
the last column we show the total decay width of S, which is very small in our models. We
observe that there are rather striking diﬀerences between the three RS models considered
here, even though any of the three benchmark points reproduces the diphoton signal and is
consistent with all other bounds. In particular, the S → W W , ZZ and t¯t branching ratios
vary signiﬁcantly from one model to another, indicating that future measurements of these
modes will provide very interesting clues about the underlying model. Note also that in all
cases we ﬁnd that the S → Zγ branching fraction is very small, so that it will be challenging

to observe this mode in our scenarios. On the other hand, not seeing the S → Zγ signal would
be as important a ﬁnding as seeing it.

Impact of Higgs portal couplings

(47)

After electroweak symmetry breaking, the ﬁrst of these interactions gives rise to three interest-
ing (and potentially dangerous) eﬀects. First, the presence of a tadpole for the ﬁeld S requires
that we deﬁne the physical ﬁeld by the shift S → S − (λ1v2)/(2mS). Performing this shift
in the Lagrangian (14) generates corrections to the SM Yukawa couplings and wave-function
corrections to the gauge ﬁelds. Otherwise these corrections do not have observable eﬀects.
Second, there is a tree-level decay S → hh, generated by the upper two diagrams shown in
Figure 5, whose decay rate (at leading order in the portal coupling λ1) is given by

Third, there is a mass mixing between the scalar resonance S and the Higgs boson. At leading

ZZ decay amplitudes induced by the lower two diagrams in Figure 5. The corrected expression
for the S → t¯t decay width is then given by

and similarly for S → ZZ. The mixing between the ﬁelds S and h also has an impact on
the properties of the Higgs boson. The physical Higgs boson is given by the combination
(cos θ h − sin θ S), where tan 2θ = 2λ1mSv/(m2
h) ≈ 0.67λ1. Existing measurements of
the Higgs branching fractions constrain cos θ to be larger than 0.86 at 95% CL [91, 92], which
implies the rather weak constraint |λ1| < 2.7 in our model.
The S → hh decay channel and the admixture of a tree-level coupling to W W and ZZ
induced by the mixing with the Higgs boson can have a signiﬁcant impact on our phenomeno-
logical analysis. In Figure 6, we present the 1σ and 2σ ﬁt regions to the diphoton excess in the
custodial RS models in the presence of the portal coupling λ1. These plots are analogous to
those shown in Figure 4, except that we have ﬁxed the values of gt/geﬀ to those of the bench-
mark points in (46). The meaning of the colors of the various curves is the same as before.
In all cases the LHC Run 1 bound on the S → ZZ rate provides the strongest constraint,
excluding portal couplings |λ1| (cid:38) 0.05 (0.07) in the custodial RS model I (II). The impact

of a small portal coupling λ1 = 0.02 on the various branching ratios is shown in the lower
portion of Table 3. Even for such a small coupling the S → W W , ZZ branching ratios can
be signiﬁcantly enhanced, and a sizable S → hh branching fraction can open up.
6 Three-body decay S → t¯th

The eﬀective Lagrangian (16) contains a tree-level coupling of the new resonance S to a t¯t
pair and a Higgs boson. It is interesting to ask if this coupling might explain the enhanced
t¯th production rates reported by ATLAS and CMS [93]. At tree level, the three-body decay
S → t¯th is mediated by the diagrams shown in Figure 7. Note that both portal couplings
introduced in (47) contribute here. Introducing the dimensionless variables z = m2

shown in the penultimate column in Table 3. This branching ratio is typically two orders of
magnitude smaller than the S → t¯t branching fraction. This will be true in any model in
which the decays of the new resonance can be described in terms of local operators. Given
the existing upper bound from t¯t resonance searches in Run 1 shown in Table 2, we would
expect that the rate for pp → S → t¯th at √s = 8 TeV cannot be larger than about 7 fb. This

falls short by far to explain the enhanced Higgs production rate in association with t¯t. In our
speciﬁc models, the predicted t¯th production rates do not exceed 2 fb.

7 Conclusions

The recent hint of a 750 GeV diphoton excess, observed in the data from Run 2 of the LHC
by both ATLAS and CMS, could be the ﬁrst direct manifestation of physics beyond the SM.
If veriﬁed by future analyses, this excess will most likely have been created by the decay of a
new, scalar boson with a mass of 750 GeV produced either in gluon fusion or in b¯b-initiated
scattering. Many possible interpretations of such a boson have been proposed. Remarkably,
the simple addition of a single new scalar to the SM as well as several well motivated UV
completions – including the Minimal Supersymmetric SM – have already been excluded.

In this paper, we have shown that the diphoton signal can be reproduced from a very
straightforward extension of the popular warped extra-dimension models introduced by Ran-
dall and Sundrum. In these models, our spacetime is enlarged by a warped extra dimension in
order to give natural explanations of the gauge and ﬂavor hierarchy problems of the SM. We
have identiﬁed the diphoton resonance with the lightest excitation of an additional bulk scalar
ﬁeld. Such a scalar might serve as the localizer ﬁeld providing a dynamical generation of the
bulk mass parameters of the 5D fermions and is thus a natural ingredient of RS models with
bulk matter ﬁelds. In addition to a model with a minimal particle content, we have discussed
two implementations of RS models providing a custodial protection mechanism for electroweak
precision observables. These models feature a larger number of fundamental 5D fermions com-
pared with the SM. As a result, the gluon-fusion production process and the decay into two
photons are enhanced by the large multiplicity of vector-like KK fermion states propagating
in the loop. By summing up the contribution from the inﬁnite towers of KK fermions into 5D
propagator functions we were able to derive remarkably simple analytic expressions for the
eﬀective couplings to gluons or photons, which to very good approximation simply count the
number of fermionic degrees of freedom, weighted by group-theory factors. For the custodial
RS models, we have found that with O(1) couplings of the resonance S to fermions and KK
masses in the multi-TeV range one can explain the diphoton signal without violating any of
the Run 1 bounds from resonance searches in various diboson and dijet channels.

Useful side products of our analysis, which can be adapted to any model for the diphoton
resonance that at the scale µ = mS can be mapped onto an eﬀective Lagrangian with local
interactions, are the calculation of the gluon-fusion production cross section σ(pp → S) at
NNLO in QCD, an expression for the inclusive S → gg decay rate at N3LO, a study of
the S → t¯th three-body decay mode, and a phenomenological analysis of portal couplings
connecting S with the Higgs ﬁeld.

23

We conclude that our simple extension of the established RS models can deliver one of
the most elegant and minimal new-physics explanations for the observed diphoton excess.
Assuming that the resonance will survive future veriﬁcations, it could hint at the existence of
a warped extra dimension and open the door to detailed studies of the parameter space of RS
models.
