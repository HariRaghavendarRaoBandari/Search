Abstract – We show that, at low inertia and large elasticity, shell models of viscoelastic ﬂuids
develop a chaotic behaviour with properties similar to those of elastic turbulence. The low di-
mensionality of shell models allows us to explore a wide range both in polymer concentration and
in Weissenberg number. Our results demonstrate that the physical mechanisms at the origin of
elastic turbulence do not rely on the boundary conditions or on the geometry of the mean ﬂow.

Introduction. – Elastic turbulence is a chaotic
regime that develops in low-inertia viscoelastic ﬂuids when
the elasticity of the ﬂuid exceeds a critical value [1]. It is
characterised by power-law velocity spectra (both in time
and in space) and by a strong increase of the ﬂow resis-
tance compared to the laminar regime. Elastic turbulence
diﬀers from hydrodynamic turbulence in that inertial non-
linearities are irrelevant and the chaotic behaviour of the
ﬂow is entirely generated by elastic instabilities.
In ad-
dition, the spatial spectrum of the velocity decays faster
than in hydrodynamics turbulence; thus, the velocity ﬁeld
is smooth in space. Elastic turbulence has important ap-
plications, since the possibility of inducing instabilities
at low Reynolds numbers allows the generation of mix-
ing ﬂows in microﬂuidics devices [2, 3]. This phenomenon
has been used, for instance, to study the deformation of
DNA molecules in chaotic ﬂows [4]. Furthermore, elastic
turbulence provides a possible explanation of the improve-
ment in oil-displacement eﬃciency that is observed when
polymer solutions are used to ﬂood reservoir rocks [5].

The ﬁrst experiments on elastic turbulence have used
conﬁned ﬂows with curved stream lines [6]. Nonethe-
less, purely elastic instabilities have been shown to de-
velop also in a viscoelastic version of the Kolmogorov ﬂow,
which is periodic and parallel [7, 8]. Indeed, elastic turbu-
lence in the viscoelastic Kolmogorov ﬂow exhibits a phe-
nomenology qualitatively similar to that observed in ex-
periments [9, 10]. Low-Reynolds-number elastic instabili-
ties have also been predicted for the Poiseuille ﬂow [11] and
for the planar Couette ﬂow [12] of a polymer solution at
large elasticity. More recently, elastic turbulence has been
observed experimentally in a straight microchannel [13,14]

and numerically in a periodic square [15]. These ﬁndings
indicate that elastic turbulence also develops in simpliﬁed
ﬂow conﬁgurations and that the speciﬁc geometry of the
system may not play a crucial role in this phenomenon.
In this Letter, we take a step further in this direction and
study elastic turbulence in a shell model of polymer solu-
tion.

Hydrodynamical shell models are low-dimensional mod-
els that preserve the essential shell-to-shell energy trans-
fer feature of the original partial diﬀerential equations in
Fourier space. Despite the fact that they are not de-
rived from the principle hydrodynamic equations in any
rigorous way, they have played a fundamental role in
the study of ﬂuid turbulence since they are numerically
tractable [16–19]. Shell models have also achieved remark-
able success in problems related to passive-scalar turbu-
lence [20–23], magnetohydrodynamic turbulence [24], ro-
tating turbulence [25], binary ﬂuids [26,27], and ﬂuids with
polymer additives [28,29]. Furthermore, the mathematical
study of shell models has yielded several rigorous results,
whose analogs are still lacking for the three-dimensional
Navier–Stokes equations (e.g., Refs. [30, 31]).

A shell model of polymer solution can be obtained by
coupling the evolution of the velocity variables with the
evolution of an additional set of variables representing the
polymer end-to-end separation ﬁeld. Shell models of poly-
mer solutions have been successfully applied to the study
of drag reduction in forced [28, 32, 33] and decaying [29]
turbulence, two-dimensional turbulence with polymer ad-
ditives [34], and turbulent thermal convection in viscoelas-
tic ﬂuids [35,36]. Here, we study a shell model of polymer
solution in the regime of low inertia and high elasticity. We

show that this shell model undergoes a transition froam
a laminar to a chaotic regime with properties remarkably
similar to those of elastic turbulence. Moreover, the use of
a low-dimensional model allows us to explore the proper-
ties of elastic turbulence over a wide range both in polymer
concentration and in Weissenberg number, which would
be diﬃcult to cover with direct numerical simulations of
constitutive models of viscoelastic ﬂuids.

Shell model of polymer solution. – We con-
sider the shell model of polymer solution introduced by
Kalelkar et al. [29], which is based on a shell model ini-
tially proposed for three-dimensional magnetohydrody-
namics [37, 39] and reduces to the GOY model [40, 41]
when polymers are absent. The shell model by Kalelkar
et al. [29] can be regarded as a reduced, low-dimensional
version of the FENE model [42]. It describes the tempo-
ral evolution of a set of complex scalar variables vn and
bn representing the velocity ﬁeld and the polymer end-to-
end separation ﬁeld, respectively. The variables vn and bn
evolve according to the following equations [29]:

a3 = −(1 − ), a4 = 1/6, a5 = 1/3, a6 = −2/3, and the
single free parameter  determines whether or not, in the
absence of polymers, the behaviour of the shell model is
chaotic. The GOY shell model for ﬂuids indeed shows a
chaotic behaviour for 0.33 (cid:46)  (cid:46) 0.9 and a non-chaotic
behaviour for  (cid:46) 0.33 [43, 44]; the standard choice for
hydrodynamic turbulence is  = 0.5 [16–19]. As we shall
see later, it is useful to study elastic turbulence in both
these regimes.

The number of shells that are used is given by N , the
coeﬃcient of kinematic viscosity by νs, the polymer re-
laxation time by τ , νp is the polymer viscosity parame-
ter, νb = 10−13νs is a damping coeﬃcient to allow for
the dissipation term −νbk2
nbn to be added to Eq. (2) in
order to improve numerical stability [29, 32, 33], and the

the wavenumber k for a highly viscous ﬂow with (red, ﬁlled
squares) and without (blue, ﬁlled circles) polymer additives
(see text). The curve without the addition of polymers do not
show any algebraic scaling. However, the addition of polymers
leads to the development of a power-law scaling k−4 in the
energy spectrum (as indicated by the thick black line).

tically stationary state. In particular we use either a de-
terministic forcing fn = f0(1 + ı)δn,2 or a white-in-time
Gaussian stochastic forcing with amplitude f0 acting on
the n = 2 shell. We choose initial conditions of the form

and (2) are solved numerically through a second-order
Adams–Bashforth method with a time step δt for all our
simulations. The numerical values for the various param-
eters of our simulations are given in Table 1.

By analogy with continuum models of polymer solu-
tions, we interpret the ratio c = νp/νs as the polymer
concentration [29, 32, 33]. We deﬁne the mean dissipation
n(cid:105); thence we extract the
rate of the ﬂow as ε = (cid:104)νs
1ε)−1/3, which allows us to deﬁne
large-scale time T = (k2
the Weissenberg number as Wi = τ /T . In our simulations
we choose eight diﬀerent values both of c and of Wi such
that 0 ≤ c ≤ 20 and 0 ≤ Wi (cid:46) 25. The Weissenberg
number is varied by varying τ , so that the inertia of the
system remains constant and negligible for all Wi.

Elastic-turbulence regime. – In order to under-
stand whether the shell model deﬁned via Eqs. (1) and (2)
indeed shows the typical features of elastic turbulence, we
perform numerical simulations of the shell model with  =
0.5 and a stochastic forcing. The parameters (see Table 1)
are such that for c = 0 the shell model is not turbulent.
The time-averaged (in the steady state) kinetic-energy
spectrum E(kn) = |vn|2/kn indeed decreases sharply with
the wavenumber kn without any apparent power-law scal-
ing (see the blue line with ﬁlled circles in Fig. 1).

A typical signature for elastic turbulence is the devel-

p-2

(cid:80)

of the polymer end-to-end separation ﬁeld does not show
a power-law behaviour and is concentrated around small
wave numbers, in agreement with direct numerical simu-
lations of elastic turbulence [15]. Thus, the shell model re-
produces the most obvious signature of elastic turbulence,
namely, the emergence of a large-scale chaotic dynamics
in a laminar ﬂow with the addition of polymers.

A global quantity like the total kinetic energy K(t) =
n v2
n(t) provides further insight into the transition to
elastic turbulence;
its temporal behaviour with varying
Wi and c indeed is an indicator of the changes of dynam-
ical regime which happen in the system [10]. In Fig. 2 we
show time series of K(t) for various combinations of c and
Wi. For cases with very small values of Wi—and indepen-
dent of the value of c—the total energy quickly saturates
to an asymptotic value with no noticeable ﬂuctuations, as
is typical for laminar ﬂows (Fig. 2, top two panels). How-
ever, as Wi increases, even for a small enough value of
c = 1.0, tiny but regular oscillations are seen in the tem-
poral dynamics of K(t) vs t (Fig. 2, middle panel). This
behaviour is shown clearly in a zoomed plot in Fig. 3(a).
Keeping the Weissenberg number ﬁxed, we now increase
the concentration (Fig. 2, bottom two panels) and see that
the total kinetic energy vs time shows increasingly chaotic
dynamics with large irregular ﬂuctuations. This behaviour
is highlighted in the zoomed-in Fig. 3(b). Figures 2 and 3
show that the shell model (which for c = 0 is laminar be-
cause of our choice of parameters), with increasing eﬀect of
polymers characterised by the concentration or the Weis-
senberg number, undergoes a transition from a laminar
phase to one with strong ﬂuctuations through a series of
intermediate periodic phases for moderate values of c and
Wi. This phenomenon was ﬁrst observed as a function
of Wi in direct numerical simulations of the Oldroyd-B
model [42] with periodic Kolmogorov forcing [10] and of
the FENE-P model [42] in a cellular ﬂow [15]. The shell
model considered here not only reproduces such a transi-
tion to chaos through periodic states as the Weissenberg
number is increased, but also shows that an analogous
transition occurs as a function of polymer concentration.

Fig. 2: The kinetic energy vs time for various values of c and
W i. From the uppermost to the lowermost curve the curves
correspond to c = 1.0, W i ≈ 0.25; c = 4.0, W i ≈ 0.25; c = 1.0,
W i ≈ 25; c = 4.0, W i ≈ 25; and c = 20.0, W i ≈ 25. The
top two curves show non-chaotic, laminar behaviour with a
transition to periodic dynamics in the middle curve and then
fully elastic turbulence in the bottom two.

opment of a power-law energy spectrum with an exponent
smaller than −3 as the Weissenberg number is increased
at ﬁxed Reynolds number much smaller than 1 [6, 45].
We therefore turn on the polymer ﬁeld in the shell model
(c (cid:54)= 0), and for suﬃciently large c and Wi a power-law
scaling emerges. In Fig. 1, the energy spectrum for c = 20
and Wi = 25 is shown (red squares). We see a clear power-
law behaviour, namely E(kn) ∼ k−4
n , as is indicated by
the thick black line. The value of the exponent is close to
that found in experiments [6, 45] and in numerical simu-
lations [9, 10, 46, 47] and is consistent with the theoretical
predictions based on the Oldroyd-B model [48]. The spec-
trum of the polymer end-to-end separation ﬁeld does not
show a power-law behaviour and is concentrated around
small wave numbers, in agreement with direct numerical
simulations of elastic turbulence [15]. An analogous be-
haviour is found with a deterministic forcing. This is ac-
companied by a corresponding increase of the largest Lya-
punov exponent as discussed in detail later. The spectrum

stationary. We see a clear transition from a periodic behaviour to a fully elastic turbulence regime.

Fig. 4: The map for |v3| vs |v2|, at ﬁxed W i = 25 and (a) c = 0.5 (b) c = 7.0 and (c) c = 20.0. We see a clear transition from a
non-chaotic to a chaotic behaviour.

Fig. 5: The map for |v3| vs |v2|, at ﬁxed W i = 5 and (a) c = 2.0 and (b) c = 10.0 for  = 0.3. Like in the case for  = 0.54, we
see a similar, clear transition from a non-chaotic to a chaotic behaviour.

Following Ref. [44], in Fig. 4 we also show the map |vn+1|
vs |vn|, for n = 2. The structure of this map for increas-
ing values of c further shows that the elastic-turbulence
regime emerges through period doubling.

The above results conﬁrm that the shell model with
polymer additives replicates the global features of elas-
tic turbulence. Given the relative numerical simplicity of
shell models, it now behooves us to study in detail the ef-
fects of concentration on the small-scale mixing properties
of elastic turbulence, which determine the importance of
this phenomenon for practical applications. We quantify
mixing in elastic turbulence and its dependence on c and
Wi by calculating the largest Lyapunov exponent λ of the
projection of the shell model on the vn variables. We re-
call that for the ﬂuid GOY shell model such calculations
show the chaotic–non-chaotic transitions as a function of
the single parameter  [43, 44]. For this set of calculations
we would like to ensure that, in the absence of polymers,
the ﬂow is non-chaotic in order to reveal the transition to
chaos more clearly. Thus we now study the shell model
with  = 0.3 (see Table 1), for which λ = 0 when c = 0.
In order to check the generality of our conclusions, we use
both a deterministic and a stochastic forcing and ﬁnd our
results insensitive to the precise nature of forcing.

Before we turn our attention to a quantitative measure
of the transition to elastic turbulence below, we immedi-
ately note, as seen in Fig 5, that the basic feature of tran-
sition to chaos, with increasing concentration for a ﬁxed
Wi, persists even for the case of  = 0.3.

In Figure 6 we show the Lyapunov exponent rescaled
with the polymer relaxation time, λτ , as a function of
Wi for diﬀerent values of c both for deterministic and for
stochastic forcing (inset). For small values of c (cid:46) 5, the
rescaled Lyapunov exponent remains close to 0, and hence
the system is non-chaotic or laminar. For suﬃciently large
values of c (cid:38) 5, we ﬁnd that beyond a threshold value
of the Weissenberg number (Wi ≈ 5) the rescaled Lya-
punov exponent increases approximately linearly and for
the largest value of c, at Wi (cid:38) 25, we ﬁnd λ ≈ 1/τ .
Our ﬁndings are in agreement with analogous calculations
made in the viscoleastic Kolmogorov ﬂow for a single,
ﬁxed value of the elasticity of the ﬂow [9].
It is impor-
tant to note, though, that the results for the Kolmogorov
ﬂow [9] indicates a slightly more dramatic increase of λτ
as a function of the Weissenberg number than seen in the
shell model.

We now turn to the behaviour of λτ as a function of
c for diﬀerent values of Wi, as shown in Fig. 7. As be-
fore we ﬁnd that for low Weissenberg numbers, the ﬂow
remains non-chaotic even when the polymer concentration
increases. Beyond a threshold value of Wi, there is a sharp
increase in λτ when the concentration becomes greater
than 5. Thus, provided Wi is suﬃciently large, increasing
the concentration has a destabilizing eﬀect comparable to
that observed when the Weissenberg number is increased.

Finally, the interaction between the polymers and the

comparable probabilities, i.e.
in elastic turbulence there
are continuous energy transfers between the ﬂow and the
polymers without a deﬁnite preferential direction (see also
inset of Fig. 8. This result is consistent with the behaviour
of the energy-exchange rate in decaying isotropic turbu-
lence with polymer additives, the long-time stage of which
has properties in common with elastic turbulence [47].

Conclusions. – We have considered a shell model of
viscoelastic ﬂuid that describes the coupled dynamics of
the velocity and polymer ﬁelds in the ﬂow of a polymer so-
lution. In the regime of large inertia and large elasticity,
this model was previously shown to reproduce the main
features of turbulent drag reduction. We have studied the
regime in which inertial nonlinearities are negligible and
have shown that, when the Weissenberg number becomes
suﬃciently high, the system shows a transition to a chaotic
state. A detailed analysis of this chaotic state indicates
that the shell model under consideration qualitatively re-
produces the transition to elastic turbulence observed in
experiments and in numerical simulations. The simplic-
ity of the shell model also allows us to study the elastic-
turbulence regime over a wide range of values not only
of the Weissenberg number but also of polymer concen-
tration. In particular, we ﬁnd that, when the concentra-
tion is increased while the Weissenberg number is ﬁxed,
the emergence of the chaotic regime follows a dynamics
analogous to that observed when the Weissenberg num-
ber is increased at ﬁxed polymer concentration. Thus the
transition to elastic turbulence shows similar features as a
function of Wi and of c.

This study enhances our understanding of the transi-
tion to elastic turbulence in polymer solutions. The shell
model that we have studied mimicks the interactions be-
tween the Fourier modes of the velocity ﬁeld and of the
polymer end-to-end separation ﬁeld in a viscoelastic ﬂuid,
but it contains no information on the spatial structure of
these ﬁelds. The fact that such a model can replicate the
main features of elastic turbulence shows that the spe-

Negative values of Π indicate that energy ﬂows from the
velocity variables towards the polymers; positive values of
Π correspond to energy transfers in the opposite direction.
In turbulent drag reduction, the timeseries of Π is predom-
inantly negative [28, 33]. This fact signals that polymers
drain energy from the ﬂow and justiﬁes the description
of their eﬀect as a scale-dependent eﬀective viscosity [33].
In Fig. 8, we show the probability density function of Π
in the elastic-turbulence regime of the shell model with
 = 0.3 at diﬀerent concentrations for a ﬁxed value Wi.
We ﬁnd that Π takes positive and negative values with
